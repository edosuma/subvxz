WEBVTT

00:02.045 --> 00:04.088
Previously on Gotham...

00:05.924 --> 00:07.884
We will create a legacy
in this city.

00:08.635 --> 00:12.347
<i>Gotham falls... we rise.</i>

00:12.430 --> 00:13.932
Together.

00:14.015 --> 00:15.725
Why don't you understand?

00:15.808 --> 00:17.185
(grunts)
You need me!

00:17.268 --> 00:19.771
I'm the answer
to your life's question!

00:21.648 --> 00:23.441
All this happened
because of me,

00:23.525 --> 00:25.193
<i>because people were trying
to hurt me</i>

00:25.276 --> 00:27.612
<i>and the people I care about.</i>

00:27.695 --> 00:31.074
<i>CHANG: With reunification underway
and the bridges being rebuilt,</i>

00:31.157 --> 00:34.744
<i>it is my honor to bestow
upon Captain James Gordon</i>

00:34.827 --> 00:36.496
<i>the title of commissioner.</i>

00:36.579 --> 00:37.872
What do you mean you're leaving?

00:37.956 --> 00:40.208
- Gotham's in good hands.
- Thank you, Bruce.

00:40.291 --> 00:43.419
That you are the only son
that I will ever have.

00:43.503 --> 00:45.463
<i>And I could not be more proud.</i>

00:53.054 --> 00:55.390
(ship horn blowing)

01:13.992 --> 01:15.910
(indistinct chatter)

01:19.747 --> 01:22.041
<i>BRUCE:
Alfred...</i>

01:22.125 --> 01:24.627
<i>I'm writing to let you know
I'm okay...</i>

01:25.712 --> 01:29.132
<i>and that you won't hear
from me for some time.</i>

01:32.719 --> 01:35.638
<i>But I will return...</i>

01:35.722 --> 01:38.558
<i>when I know I'm able to protect
the people I love.</i>

01:40.393 --> 01:43.479
<i>When Gotham needs me...</i>

01:43.563 --> 01:45.481
<i>I will return.</i>

01:46.691 --> 01:48.610
<i>N' N'</i>

02:01.164 --> 02:03.041
(sirens wailing in distance)

02:07.462 --> 02:09.631
GORDON:
It began a few weeks ago.

02:09.714 --> 02:13.176
Someone attacking
the gangs downtown.

02:13.259 --> 02:14.969
No deaths so far, at least.

02:15.053 --> 02:17.347
Hoods couldn't give
a description, but, uh,

02:17.430 --> 02:20.683
they did mention a growling.

02:20.767 --> 02:21.976
A growling?

02:22.060 --> 02:23.853
It's a rumor;
ignore it.

02:23.936 --> 02:26.189
Oswald Cobblepot gets out
of Blackgate tomorrow.

02:26.272 --> 02:28.191
One theory is he's
sending someone

02:28.274 --> 02:30.735
to put the fear of God
into the underworld.

02:30.818 --> 02:33.613
And you choose this moment
to hand in your resignation.

02:33.696 --> 02:35.114
I told you that months ago.

02:35.198 --> 02:36.407
That's not the point.

02:36.491 --> 02:38.910
Look, things are unstable.
I-isn't there, uh,

02:38.993 --> 02:40.495
uh, some break-in

02:40.578 --> 02:42.997
at a government warehouse that
you guys haven't solved yet?

02:43.081 --> 02:44.749
Yeah, 'cause the Feds
won't tell us squat.

02:44.832 --> 02:47.251
I'm not looking for excuses!

02:48.503 --> 02:51.756
Look... you mean
something to this city.

02:51.839 --> 02:52.840
You can't quit.

02:54.008 --> 02:55.218
Not now.

02:55.301 --> 02:57.053
Because of Wayne Tower.

02:57.136 --> 02:58.846
Bruce Wayne is returning
home for the first time

02:58.930 --> 03:00.181
in a decade
for its opening.

03:00.264 --> 03:03.351
The new Wayne Tower
represents hope for Gotham.

03:04.102 --> 03:07.939
So, yeah... I need you.

03:09.941 --> 03:13.444
Mayor James...
I told you I would stay

03:13.528 --> 03:16.072
until after
the Wayne inaugural.

03:17.115 --> 03:19.283
Then I'm done.

03:23.204 --> 03:24.455
If you'll excuse me,

03:24.539 --> 03:26.791
I have a fund-raiser
I have to get ready for.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.127
Good day, gentlemen.

03:29.669 --> 03:30.878
BULLOCK:
Jim.

03:31.963 --> 03:34.298
I've had ten years, Harv.

03:34.382 --> 03:36.509
It's time for someone else
to have a chance.

03:36.592 --> 03:39.137
And you wait for Bruce
to come back to hang it up?

03:39.220 --> 03:41.055
That's a coincidence?

03:41.973 --> 03:44.183
I'm late.
I have to meet Barbara.

03:44.267 --> 03:45.393
Yeah.

03:46.018 --> 03:47.353
The queen of Gotham.

03:48.813 --> 03:49.981
Tell me something.

03:50.064 --> 03:52.525
Why didn't I buy up half
of Gotham on the cheap

03:52.608 --> 03:54.068
after reunification?

03:54.152 --> 03:56.487
Become a tycoon. Hmm?

03:57.280 --> 04:00.074
Give a kiss to the little one
from Uncle Harv.

04:00.533 --> 04:02.452
Will do.

04:02.535 --> 04:04.954
(door opens)

04:07.039 --> 04:08.666
GORDON:
Hey, slugger.

04:08.750 --> 04:10.918
Daddy!

04:11.002 --> 04:12.128
(speaking indistinctly)

04:12.211 --> 04:14.130
- Just do it.
- Yes, ma'am.

04:16.298 --> 04:18.468
Hi, sweetheart.

04:19.844 --> 04:22.430
So... did you hear
from Bruce?

04:23.181 --> 04:24.432
No.

04:24.515 --> 04:26.392
Ten years and
not a word.

04:26.476 --> 04:29.270
But I'm assuming he'll be at the
gala for Wayne Tower tomorrow.

04:29.353 --> 04:31.731
I want to see the look on
his face when I tell him,

04:31.814 --> 04:34.192
in three months he won't have
the tallest building

04:34.275 --> 04:35.818
in Gotham anymore.

04:36.736 --> 04:38.237
Hmm.

04:39.655 --> 04:40.656
Think he'll recognize you

04:40.740 --> 04:42.700
with that caterpillar
on your top lip?

04:44.452 --> 04:46.287
(chuckles)

04:46.370 --> 04:47.997
Okay, munchkin, I love you.
(kisses)

04:48.080 --> 04:50.082
Don't let her stay up too late.

04:55.213 --> 04:56.506
Ice cream?

04:56.589 --> 04:58.382
Yeah.

05:00.676 --> 05:02.595
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

05:02.678 --> 05:04.597
(indistinct chatter)

05:10.436 --> 05:11.813
Bruce is back.

05:11.896 --> 05:12.897
(chuckles)

05:14.774 --> 05:16.192
Big deal.

05:18.236 --> 05:20.363
I knew him.

05:20.446 --> 05:23.241
Back in the day.

05:23.324 --> 05:26.118
Saved Gotham together.

05:28.538 --> 05:31.207
(gasps)
Oswald's being freed?

05:31.916 --> 05:33.334
Hey!

05:33.417 --> 05:35.294
I've been in
here ten years!

05:35.378 --> 05:37.129
Ten years!

05:37.213 --> 05:40.174
I deserve to read the newspaper,
you mouth breather!

05:41.759 --> 05:43.302
(chuckles)

05:44.887 --> 05:46.556
Hey!Hey!

05:47.306 --> 05:48.307
Hey!

05:50.309 --> 05:53.020
Do you know who that is?

05:56.774 --> 05:59.402
Jeremiah Valeska.

06:00.444 --> 06:02.196
And yeah...

06:02.280 --> 06:04.699
he's been
a vegetable for a decade.

06:04.782 --> 06:06.158
Can't think. Can't feel.

06:06.242 --> 06:08.119
But he is

06:08.202 --> 06:10.204
alegend.

06:10.288 --> 06:13.749
And if you're gonna
screw with a legend...

06:21.799 --> 06:24.385
...do it properly. (chuckling)

06:27.305 --> 06:29.140
This never gets
old. (chuckles)

06:29.223 --> 06:31.225
(alarm ringing)

06:31.309 --> 06:33.311
(inmates screaming)

06:41.527 --> 06:43.571
Hey,buddy,
I got something for you.

06:43.654 --> 06:44.822
Hey!

06:44.906 --> 06:46.073
What are you doing?
Where are you taking me?

06:46.157 --> 06:47.158
Come on.

06:56.959 --> 06:59.128
NURSE:
Out of the way.

07:16.479 --> 07:18.064
Whoa.

07:18.147 --> 07:20.149
Yup. It was time
to admit it.

07:20.232 --> 07:22.401
I was trying something.
It didn't work.

07:24.528 --> 07:26.447
You liked it, right?

07:26.989 --> 07:28.407
Totally.

07:29.241 --> 07:30.785
At least now Bruce
will recognize you.

07:30.868 --> 07:33.079
Hmm. That's very funny.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.376
I wonder how much
he's changed.

07:38.459 --> 07:40.878
Well, it's been ten years.
I'd imagine a lot.

07:40.962 --> 07:42.505
Well, we haven't.

07:42.588 --> 07:44.465
I'm still a doctor.
You're still a cop.

07:44.548 --> 07:47.176
Mm. Not for long.

07:49.428 --> 07:51.889
Are you having second thoughts
about leaving?

07:52.723 --> 07:54.225
Well...

07:54.308 --> 07:56.394
I'm all for it.

07:56.477 --> 07:58.354
But I know how much
this job means to you.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.565
And how much the city
looks to you. It always has.

08:01.649 --> 08:03.609
Well, that's just it.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.904
I was hoping
Gotham would outgrow me.

08:07.947 --> 08:09.991
But it hasn't
exactly happened.

08:10.074 --> 08:11.993
No one's stepped forward.

08:14.328 --> 08:16.288
Well, maybe you need
to step down

08:16.372 --> 08:18.624
to allow someone to step up.

08:19.667 --> 08:22.461
(sighs)
Jim Gordon.

08:23.004 --> 08:24.588
Clean-shaven man of leisure.

08:24.672 --> 08:25.673
(chuckles)

08:27.133 --> 08:29.010
(chuckles)

08:31.762 --> 08:33.431
Ten years.

08:34.974 --> 08:37.434
I wonder what Bruce
will think of Selina.

08:38.436 --> 08:41.688
<i>She's become quite the it girl
around town.</i>

08:43.024 --> 08:45.901
(beeping)

09:08.924 --> 09:10.885
<i>N' N'</i>

09:28.277 --> 09:30.279
<i>N' N'</i>

09:58.641 --> 10:00.267
(gasps)

10:08.651 --> 10:10.569
(siren wailing in distance)

10:17.618 --> 10:19.537
(indistinct chatter)

10:23.582 --> 10:26.460
So they have no idea
when Nygma actually escaped?

10:26.544 --> 10:28.254
He wasn't in his
cell this morning.

10:28.337 --> 10:29.547
This is where
the guard lives.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.799
The one that didn't
show for work.

10:31.882 --> 10:33.759
All right. I got it.

10:33.843 --> 10:35.678
Stay here in case
something else comes in.

10:35.761 --> 10:36.971
All right.

10:43.769 --> 10:45.646
(car horns honking in distance)

10:50.609 --> 10:52.653
GCPD.

10:55.948 --> 10:57.408
No! Okay. Okay..-

10:57.491 --> 11:00.744
Shut up! Talk to him.

11:00.828 --> 11:03.581
(grunting)

11:04.665 --> 11:06.250
This is
Detective Bullock.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.919
(breath trembling)

11:09.003 --> 11:10.504
You understand?

11:10.588 --> 11:11.922
Oh, my God.

11:12.006 --> 11:14.175
You understand
what you have to do?

11:15.301 --> 11:16.594
Oh, my God.

11:16.677 --> 11:17.720
I don't have a choice!

11:17.803 --> 11:19.638
(gunshon
(body thuds)

11:29.148 --> 11:31.066
(door opens)

11:42.203 --> 11:44.079
What the hell happened, Harvey?

11:44.747 --> 11:46.832
What did Harper say?

11:47.917 --> 11:49.960
I want to hear it from you.

11:50.544 --> 11:53.047
We, uh, tracked down
this Arkham guard

11:53.130 --> 11:55.841
we thought maybe
helped Nygma escape.

11:55.925 --> 11:57.676
I shot him.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.511
End of story.

12:00.846 --> 12:02.264
You're confessing...

12:02.348 --> 12:04.892
to killing an unarmed
suspect in cold blood.

12:04.975 --> 12:06.602
That's what happened.

12:07.269 --> 12:08.896
You got to let it go.

12:08.979 --> 12:10.981
Harvey, I don't
know if you think

12:11.065 --> 12:13.776
you're protecting
yourself or someone else,

12:13.859 --> 12:15.236
but you need
to change your story.

12:15.319 --> 12:17.112
Otherwise
you're going to Blackgate.

12:17.196 --> 12:20.115
And you know what happens
to cops in Blackgate.

12:22.493 --> 12:25.037
That's what happened.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.790
So let it go.

12:27.873 --> 12:29.792
(indistinct chatter)

12:42.846 --> 12:45.224
All right, first things first.

12:45.307 --> 12:47.935
Whoever here doesn't believe
Harvey Bullock is innocent

12:48.018 --> 12:49.937
can leave right now.

12:55.317 --> 12:56.527
Good.

12:57.194 --> 12:59.029
(sighs)
You think Nygma's behind this?

12:59.113 --> 13:02.449
Maybe. But he's been
inside Arkham for ten years.

13:02.533 --> 13:04.118
It's not like he suddenly
decided to break out.

13:04.201 --> 13:06.537
He had help. ALVAREZ: Penguin
gets released today.

13:06.620 --> 13:07.871
You think...?

13:07.955 --> 13:10.082
Yeah. Put a tail on him.

13:10.749 --> 13:12.418
In the meantime, I
want every other cop

13:12.501 --> 13:14.461
in this city
on the hunt for Edward Nygma.

13:14.545 --> 13:15.963
We looked into
the dead guard.

13:16.046 --> 13:18.173
He used to be associated
with a southside gang.

13:18.257 --> 13:19.967
Got an address.
An old warehouse.

13:20.050 --> 13:21.176
All right.
You and I will hit it.

13:21.260 --> 13:23.887
Rest of you have your
orders. Let's go.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.889
(rat squeaking)

13:29.977 --> 13:31.729
(gasps)

13:31.812 --> 13:34.273
(panting)

13:36.025 --> 13:37.901
(echoing);
Hello?!

13:38.819 --> 13:41.071
Anybody?!

13:42.031 --> 13:43.866
anybody!

14:02.509 --> 14:05.304
"Dear Ed, my old friend.

14:05.387 --> 14:07.765
"Half of Gotham
thinks you a madman.

14:07.848 --> 14:10.559
"The other half
has forgotten you.

14:11.268 --> 14:13.854
It's time to remind them
who the Riddler is."

14:15.606 --> 14:18.525
"I've given you all you need.
Follow the instructions.

14:18.609 --> 14:19.777
Oswald."

14:28.660 --> 14:30.371
(laughing)

14:34.083 --> 14:36.251
Oswald...

14:36.335 --> 14:38.504
what are you planning?

14:43.842 --> 14:46.011
<i>N' N'</i>

15:04.905 --> 15:07.199
<i>N' N'</i>

15:11.412 --> 15:13.330
(clamoring)

15:23.382 --> 15:26.802
Mr. Cobblepot, what's the first
thing you'll do as a free man?

15:27.719 --> 15:30.389
I will lay flowers on the grave
of my beloved mother.

15:30.472 --> 15:33.851
And what of Jim Gordon's role
in your incarceration?

15:33.934 --> 15:36.145
Will you seek revenge?

15:36.228 --> 15:38.188
The best revenge
against Jim Gordon

15:38.272 --> 15:41.942
will be a life spent serving
the city I love.

15:48.740 --> 15:49.950
What do you say, young man?

15:50.033 --> 15:51.326
How'd you like
an exclusive?

15:51.410 --> 15:52.536
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.329
(reporters clamoring)

15:57.332 --> 15:59.251
Your jacket and hat.

15:59.334 --> 16:00.836
What?

16:00.919 --> 16:02.296
NQW!

16:09.303 --> 16:11.221
(liquid dripping)

16:26.945 --> 16:28.947
(echoing):
GCPD!

16:33.452 --> 16:35.245
GCPD.

16:37.247 --> 16:39.041
HARPER:
This is the place.

16:43.086 --> 16:45.297
HARPER:
Good God.

16:45.380 --> 16:48.050
<i>GORDON: Did your lead say
anything about this?</i>

16:48.133 --> 16:50.719
<i>HARPER:
About a gangland bloodbath?</i>

16:51.345 --> 16:52.346
<i>No.</i>

16:53.597 --> 16:55.390
What the hell is going on?

16:57.768 --> 16:59.520
<i>GORDON:
Someone's covering their tracks.</i>

17:00.479 --> 17:01.480
<i>There was a break-in</i>

17:01.563 --> 17:03.398
<i>in a government warehouse
last week.</i>

17:03.941 --> 17:06.859
Those crates have
U.S. Army markings.

17:06.944 --> 17:08.569
(loud clatter)

17:09.445 --> 17:10.781
Find the back stairs.

17:19.623 --> 17:21.290
GCPD!

17:24.252 --> 17:26.046
I know you're here.

17:27.422 --> 17:28.715
Show yourself.

17:29.550 --> 17:31.426
<i>DISTORTED VOICE:

17:51.780 --> 17:53.115
<i>DISTORTED VOICE:

17:53.198 --> 17:54.908
Don't move!

17:56.577 --> 17:58.120

17:59.037 --> 18:01.665

18:31.695 --> 18:32.696
HARPER:
Okay, thanks.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.115
(siren chirps outside)

18:36.033 --> 18:38.785
Bomb squad said the bodies
were rigged with C-4.

18:38.869 --> 18:40.495
Whoever that was
saved our lives.

18:41.079 --> 18:42.623
Suggesting...

18:42.706 --> 18:44.499
that he wasn't the one
that killed them.

18:44.583 --> 18:47.085
Could be he's hunting the
same person we're hunting.

18:47.669 --> 18:49.212
Whoever's really
behind all this.

18:49.296 --> 18:51.923
- You thinking he's on our side?
- Yeah, maybe.

18:52.007 --> 18:53.383
That C-4 has to have been

18:53.467 --> 18:55.594
what was stolen
from the government warehouse.

18:55.677 --> 18:57.929
Which means most of it's
still missing.

18:58.013 --> 19:00.766
Just got a call.
Mayor James vanished,

19:00.849 --> 19:02.476
and our tail lost Penguin.

19:03.101 --> 19:04.645
Sir, what the hell is going on?

19:05.145 --> 19:07.272
First Nygma,
now Penguin.

19:08.190 --> 19:09.816
Keep it simple.

19:10.942 --> 19:13.528
Imagine all that C-4.

19:14.071 --> 19:16.823
What's the biggest target
in Gotham right now?

19:16.907 --> 19:19.409
Double security
for tonight's event.

19:19.493 --> 19:22.954
I have to talk to Bruce Wayne
and Alfred Pennyworth.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.589
Hello, old friend.

19:32.673 --> 19:34.383
- Oswald...
- One more word,

19:34.466 --> 19:37.844
and I will put a bullet in you
here and now.

19:37.928 --> 19:39.304
Drive.

19:42.724 --> 19:44.351
(engine starts)

19:47.229 --> 19:48.355
Oswald...

19:48.438 --> 19:51.191
Don't talk!

19:51.274 --> 19:53.485
Turn around!

19:55.195 --> 19:57.072
Remember when
we stood here, Jim,

19:57.155 --> 19:59.324
all those years ago?

19:59.408 --> 20:02.494
Don Falcone wanted you
to shoot me. You refused.

20:03.078 --> 20:05.497
Now don't you wish
you had done it?

20:06.164 --> 20:08.750
Everyone will know you did this.

20:08.834 --> 20:10.210
(laughs quietly)

20:10.293 --> 20:11.837
Let them!

20:11.920 --> 20:17.050
We both know that this has been
a long time coming.

20:17.551 --> 20:19.553
Our story is...

20:19.636 --> 20:21.972
over, old friend.

20:22.055 --> 20:24.099
You want to
kill me, fine.

20:24.725 --> 20:27.853
But there's no need
to attack the Wayne gala.

20:29.354 --> 20:31.064
What are you talking about?

20:31.148 --> 20:33.358
Breaking Nygma
out of Arkham.

20:33.442 --> 20:35.026
The attacks
on the gangs.

20:35.110 --> 20:36.403
What do you think,
you're gonna be able

20:36.486 --> 20:39.364
to destroy Wayne Tower
and no one's gonna notice?

20:40.490 --> 20:43.034
I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:43.660 --> 20:45.662
You and I stood
shoulder to shoulder

20:45.746 --> 20:49.082
on those barricades,
ready to die for this city.

20:50.292 --> 20:51.501
Six months later,

20:51.585 --> 20:54.629
you locked me up like an animal!

20:55.213 --> 20:57.716
This begins and ends

20:57.799 --> 21:00.552
with you and me!

21:01.970 --> 21:04.097
You're telling the truth.

21:04.806 --> 21:07.684
Goodbye, Jim.

21:07.768 --> 21:09.519
(cocks pistol)
Turn around!

21:10.103 --> 21:12.439
You know, you made a mistake
bringing me out to this pier.

21:12.522 --> 21:14.357
Don't talk!

21:14.441 --> 21:16.318
Or maybe you
just have a short memory.

21:16.401 --> 21:17.611
(gasping)

21:21.281 --> 21:24.618

21:29.915 --> 21:32.501

21:40.550 --> 21:43.970
So, this is
Bruce's new Gotham.

21:44.054 --> 21:45.931
I like the old one.

21:47.766 --> 21:49.851
Sefina?

21:51.061 --> 21:52.979
How wonderful to see you again.

21:53.063 --> 21:55.148
It's been far,
far too long.

21:55.774 --> 21:57.359
Where is he?

21:57.442 --> 21:59.444
Well, I-I'm afraid travels
abroad haven't increased

21:59.528 --> 22:02.364
Master Bruce's respect
for punctuality, Miss Kyle.

22:03.198 --> 22:05.867
I came here to tell him
to stop spying on me.

22:06.743 --> 22:08.245
I don't understand.

22:08.328 --> 22:09.496
I was out the
other night

22:09.579 --> 22:11.248
and I felt someone watching me.

22:11.331 --> 22:12.833
I know it was Bruce.

22:12.916 --> 22:14.417
Oh, I see,
right, well,

22:14.501 --> 22:16.503
that makes perfect sense.

22:16.586 --> 22:19.130
So you come here tonight dressed
to the nines to tell him

22:19.214 --> 22:20.715
that you want nothing more
to do with him.

22:20.799 --> 22:21.800
Is that the kind of gist of it?

22:21.883 --> 22:23.718
He left, Alfred.

22:23.802 --> 22:26.388
Everything we went through,
and one day he's just gone.

22:26.471 --> 22:28.473
He doesn't get to come back
after ten years

22:28.557 --> 22:30.642
and act like nothing's happened.

22:32.561 --> 22:34.563
On this, we absolutely agree.

22:35.438 --> 22:37.274
I do, however,
feel it might be something

22:37.357 --> 22:39.609
that you want to tell him
yourself.

22:40.235 --> 22:42.863
He needs to stay away.

22:46.700 --> 22:50.245

22:58.670 --> 23:01.506
I think Bruce is gonna regret
being gone all these years.

23:02.883 --> 23:04.843
Follow me.

23:04.926 --> 23:06.845

23:06.928 --> 23:07.971

23:08.054 --> 23:10.307
NYGMA:
Credit to Bruce.

23:10.390 --> 23:13.184
He did not skimp
on the caterers.

23:14.227 --> 23:15.854
Hungry?

23:15.937 --> 23:17.397
(muffled):
Uh-uh.

23:17.480 --> 23:20.150

23:20.233 --> 23:21.985

Lucius.

23:31.411 --> 23:32.954

23:33.038 --> 23:35.165
Heard about Harvey--
how is he? How's Jim?

23:35.248 --> 23:36.249
I don't know.

23:36.333 --> 23:37.959
I was hoping he

23:40.503 --> 23:45.175
Uh, my name is Alfred Thaddeus

23:45.258 --> 23:48.136

Hello, Ed.

24:07.322 --> 24:08.865
Barbara Kean.

24:09.491 --> 24:10.533
In red.

24:10.617 --> 24:12.077
(chuckles)

24:14.412 --> 24:16.498
Oh, no.

24:16.581 --> 24:19.209
Please tell me you are not here
to stop me.

24:19.960 --> 24:21.670
Barbara...

24:21.753 --> 24:24.965
Do you even remember how
amazing you used to be?

24:25.048 --> 24:27.968
Honey, I'm still amazing.

24:28.051 --> 24:30.303
(chuckles)
I just made a choice.

24:32.305 --> 24:34.391
You made a choice.

24:34.474 --> 24:37.185
Some of us don't get
to make choices.

24:37.268 --> 24:39.521
I'm The Riddler.

24:39.604 --> 24:42.565
And tonight Gotham
will remember that.

24:42.649 --> 24:44.776
By blowing up this ding-dong?

24:44.859 --> 24:46.069
Didn't you do that already?

24:46.152 --> 24:47.404
It's a callback.

24:49.489 --> 24:51.950
I was waiting for Bruce
to begin his speech.

24:52.033 --> 24:55.870
You know, come out,
present a riddle.

24:55.954 --> 24:58.331
Only Bruce doesn't
seem to want to show.

24:59.416 --> 25:00.959
So I think
I'm gonna have to imp...

25:01.960 --> 25:03.712

25:03.795 --> 25:05.046

25:05.130 --> 25:07.382
BARBARA:
Sorry, Ed.

25:08.049 --> 25:09.884
Not tonight.

25:09.968 --> 25:13.221
Wayne Enterprises
will devote itself

25:13.304 --> 25:15.348
to making this future a reality.

25:16.891 --> 25:19.894
- Lee.
-(Alfred continues indistinctly)

25:19.978 --> 25:22.188
- THOMPKINS: Jim.
- I'm fine. Evacuate the building.

25:22.272 --> 25:25.025
- Get these people out of here.
- JAMES: Help!

25:25.108 --> 25:26.526
Gordon!

25:26.609 --> 25:28.987
Help! Gordon!

25:29.070 --> 25:30.697
Gordon, help!
(crowd screaming)

25:30.780 --> 25:32.657
This lunatic.

25:32.741 --> 25:34.409
He kidnapped me again.

25:34.492 --> 25:36.244
He tried to blow me up. Again!

25:36.327 --> 25:37.871
But we stopped him.

25:37.954 --> 25:39.372
You're welcome.

25:39.456 --> 25:40.457
Take care of the mayor, please.

25:40.540 --> 25:41.875
Get that thing off of him.

25:41.958 --> 25:43.585
Excuse me.

25:43.668 --> 25:44.794
There were four crates of C-4.

25:44.878 --> 25:46.337
Where are the rest?

25:46.421 --> 25:47.881
That's all he gave me.

25:47.964 --> 25:50.008
- He said Penguin broke him out.
- No.

25:50.091 --> 25:51.509
It wasn't Penguin.
Get him out of there.

25:51.593 --> 25:53.011
What?

25:53.094 --> 25:55.221
Hey! Get off me.

25:55.305 --> 25:56.473
Penguin not's just the patsy.

25:56.556 --> 25:58.224
He's not even the real threat.

25:58.308 --> 25:59.684
Which means there must be...

26:04.647 --> 26:06.608
<i>N' N'</i>

26:11.404 --> 26:15.158
(beeping)

26:21.539 --> 26:22.957
GORDON:
If this bomb goes off

26:23.041 --> 26:25.418
and Wayne Tower falls,
it'll take out other buildings.

26:25.502 --> 26:26.711
A lot of people are gonna die.

26:26.795 --> 26:28.713
You all need to leave right now.

26:28.797 --> 26:30.840
So you can stay?
Absolutely not.

26:30.924 --> 26:32.050
It's too late.

26:32.133 --> 26:33.635
We'd never get far enough away.

26:33.718 --> 26:36.596
Ms. Kean is right;
this stops right here.

26:39.432 --> 26:40.850
So how do we defuse it?

26:40.934 --> 26:43.186
We'd have to sever
the connectors to the detonator,

26:43.269 --> 26:44.437
but the bomber
must have hidden it.

26:44.521 --> 26:46.022
The wires go up inside
the model.

26:46.106 --> 26:48.066
It must be in one
of the buildings.

26:48.149 --> 26:49.359
I tracked down a gang today--

26:49.442 --> 26:51.319
they had bomb-making materials,

26:51.402 --> 26:53.113
pictures of buildings.

26:53.905 --> 26:55.490
One in particular:

26:56.074 --> 26:57.325
Gotham Clock Tower.

26:59.744 --> 27:01.663
(alarm ringing)

27:01.746 --> 27:03.665
Let's go.

27:05.542 --> 27:06.751
In here.

27:09.420 --> 27:11.005
(grunts)

27:11.089 --> 27:12.423
Wait, wait, wait.

27:12.507 --> 27:14.384
(beeping)

27:27.355 --> 27:31.025
Wait. This particular detonator
has a gyroscope.

27:31.109 --> 27:35.071
Which means someone will have
to hold it up and steady

27:35.155 --> 27:36.823
while you detach
the wires from below.

27:36.906 --> 27:39.367
I have doctor's hands,
I can do it.

27:46.166 --> 27:48.126
Fine. Lucius.

27:52.964 --> 27:54.799
LUCIUS: All right,
thetfiggerconnecfion

27:54.883 --> 27:57.218
should be different
than the others.

27:57.302 --> 28:00.471
THOMPKINS:
Okay, I see two green wires.

28:01.556 --> 28:03.850
I'm gonna cut this one.

28:12.692 --> 28:14.652
<i>N' N'</i>

28:26.706 --> 28:28.875
(beeping)

28:30.001 --> 28:32.295

(Barbara sighs)

28:35.006 --> 28:36.007
- The other one. The other one.
- The other one.

28:36.090 --> 28:37.425
- The other one.
- Yes, the other one.

28:43.640 --> 28:46.893
(sighs)

28:46.976 --> 28:48.728
Never doubted you for a minute.

28:52.023 --> 28:53.274
Strange.

28:53.358 --> 28:57.195
We designed a new clock tower,
but this is the old one.

29:03.117 --> 29:04.619
That's the answer.

29:05.161 --> 29:07.622
Who's behind
all this, but...

29:08.581 --> 29:09.791
but it's not possible.

29:09.874 --> 29:11.084
HARPER:
Sir.

29:11.167 --> 29:13.169
Sir, Nygma's vanished.

29:13.253 --> 29:14.545
There's more.

29:14.629 --> 29:16.381
Mayor James ordered Bullock
sent to Blackgate.

29:16.464 --> 29:17.840
He's about to be moved.

29:17.924 --> 29:19.801
(sirens wailing in distance)

29:25.765 --> 29:29.269
GORDON:
Stop! Stop!

29:29.936 --> 29:31.020
The person who framed you,

29:31.104 --> 29:32.272
the one behind Nygma's breakout,

29:32.355 --> 29:33.815
is it who I think it is?
Has he been faking it?

29:33.898 --> 29:36.359
Jim, do not say his name!

29:36.442 --> 29:38.027
Is it Jeremiah Valeska?

29:39.654 --> 29:41.406
(grunts)
Harvey.

29:41.489 --> 29:42.991
Check him for a wire!
What?

29:43.074 --> 29:45.535
Under his shirt.
Check for a wire.

29:48.871 --> 29:50.164
BULLOCK:
Oh, God, it's too late.

29:51.582 --> 29:53.501
He's miked.

29:53.584 --> 29:55.920
Jim, you don't know
what he'll do.

29:57.005 --> 29:59.257
L-I don't know about this.

29:59.340 --> 30:01.009
How much is it again?

30:01.092 --> 30:03.928
ORDERLY: Ten bucks is a body punch.
$20, you get the face.

30:04.012 --> 30:05.346
Stabbing him is a C-note.

30:05.430 --> 30:06.556
Huh.

30:06.639 --> 30:08.349
(grunting)

30:10.351 --> 30:11.686
Bad news, boss.

30:11.769 --> 30:14.397
Our cover's blownskies.

30:16.733 --> 30:18.109
(chuckles softly)

30:18.192 --> 30:19.610

30:19.694 --> 30:20.737

30:20.820 --> 30:22.739
(car horns honking in distance)

30:24.282 --> 30:26.492
(grunts)

30:26.576 --> 30:28.119
OSWALD:
Edward Nygma.

30:28.202 --> 30:31.372
It is very good to see you.

30:31.456 --> 30:35.001
Oswald... I thought
you weren't behind this.

30:35.084 --> 30:36.085
I'm not.

30:36.169 --> 30:38.838
But I thought you might need
some help,

30:38.921 --> 30:41.674
and... what else
are friends for?

30:41.758 --> 30:43.176
(chuckles)

30:43.259 --> 30:44.761
You look well.

30:44.844 --> 30:46.929
You, too.

30:47.013 --> 30:48.097
A little thicker
in the middle.

30:48.181 --> 30:49.182
(chuckles)

30:50.683 --> 30:52.894
Damn, it's good
to see you, Oswald.

30:52.977 --> 30:54.145
(both chuckling)

30:55.063 --> 30:56.314
(tires screeching)

30:56.397 --> 30:58.524
Wh-What was that?
What was that?

30:58.608 --> 31:00.485
(screams)

31:00.568 --> 31:01.569
(crash)

31:01.652 --> 31:03.321
(horn honking)

31:07.408 --> 31:09.744
What the hell was that?!

31:09.827 --> 31:11.746
(coughs)

31:11.829 --> 31:13.706
(whooshing)

31:15.208 --> 31:17.752
(both screaming)

31:22.423 --> 31:25.009
(sirens wailing in distance)

31:29.055 --> 31:32.767
Alfred, when Bruce came
to me the day he got back

31:32.850 --> 31:34.811
and told me what he was
planning, I didn't hesitate.

31:35.812 --> 31:37.438
I believe in what he's doing,

31:37.522 --> 31:39.357
but he's going
to need some help.

31:40.191 --> 31:42.110
Has he thought
about telling Gordon?

31:43.111 --> 31:45.655
Lucius, my old friend,

31:45.738 --> 31:47.824
whoever Bruce decides to take
on this journey with him,

31:47.907 --> 31:49.742
it's his decision.

31:49.826 --> 31:53.413
Our role... is to serve.

31:54.622 --> 31:57.333
(Oswald and Nygma straining)

31:59.669 --> 32:00.920
Down!

32:01.003 --> 32:02.922
- Get me down!
- Aah!

32:04.674 --> 32:06.634
Something happened
tonight, didn't it?

32:06.717 --> 32:07.927
Why won't you tell me?

32:08.010 --> 32:10.555
Because everything
worked out okay, didn't it?

32:12.140 --> 32:14.475
So why are we at your old club?

32:14.559 --> 32:16.394
Because Mommy just needs
to get something.

(grunting)

32:47.925 --> 32:49.385
Easy.

32:49.469 --> 32:51.429
It's just
a surprise party.

32:51.929 --> 32:54.265
For you, Barbara Kean,

32:54.348 --> 32:56.559
queen of Gotham,

32:56.642 --> 32:59.937
business titan.
How exciting.

33:00.563 --> 33:02.440
But there was another you,
I...

33:02.523 --> 33:04.317
I seem to recall.

33:04.400 --> 33:05.485
Wasn't there?

33:05.568 --> 33:07.153
Then again, there was, uh,

33:07.236 --> 33:09.280
another me, too.

33:09.363 --> 33:12.325
Oh, so hard holding on
to what's real. It's...

33:12.408 --> 33:14.160
(grunts)
It's enough to drive you mad.

Mom!

33:23.961 --> 33:25.880
Cute.

33:25.963 --> 33:27.465
(panting)

33:27.548 --> 33:29.634
She has your eyes.

33:29.717 --> 33:31.219
For now.

33:31.302 --> 33:32.553
No, put me down.

33:32.637 --> 33:34.639
(whimpers)
I...

33:34.722 --> 33:36.641
think she...

33:36.724 --> 33:38.893
nicked me, Daddy.

33:38.976 --> 33:40.603
'III

33:40.686 --> 33:42.271
Oh, boy.

Oh, dear me.

My sweet Ecco,

33:46.317 --> 33:48.945
no longer my echo.

33:49.028 --> 33:51.781
There will never be one
like you.

33:51.864 --> 33:53.449
Really?

33:56.035 --> 33:57.912

34:00.081 --> 34:02.833
Butlsuppose
there are other fish in the sea.

34:02.917 --> 34:03.918
Let me...

34:04.001 --> 34:05.169
down.
(panting)

34:06.337 --> 34:07.755
- Mom!
- Hush,

34:07.838 --> 34:11.217
little Barbaras,
don't say a word.

34:11.300 --> 34:13.427
Now we're going
to play a...

34:13.511 --> 34:15.179
little game.
(panting)

34:15.263 --> 34:17.264
By now, James Gordon
should have made it

34:17.348 --> 34:18.683
to your apartment.

34:18.766 --> 34:20.893
When he gets here,
I want you to deliver

34:20.976 --> 34:22.478
a message. Okay?

34:22.562 --> 34:23.813
(exhales, sniffles)

34:23.896 --> 34:25.188
Okay?

34:25.273 --> 34:27.149
(giggles)

34:27.233 --> 34:28.859
Okay?

34:32.196 --> 34:33.322
(door opens)

34:33.406 --> 34:34.407
GORDON:
Barbara.

34:36.784 --> 34:38.703
I'll call an ambulance.

34:38.786 --> 34:39.786
Barbara.

34:39.870 --> 34:41.956
Barbara.

34:42.039 --> 34:43.373
He took her!

34:43.456 --> 34:45.083
That lunatic took her!

34:45.167 --> 34:47.253
He said you have to come,
and if you don't come,

34:47.335 --> 34:48.420
he's gonna kill her.

34:48.504 --> 34:49.714
Where?

34:50.464 --> 34:53.801
The place
where he was born again.

34:54.552 --> 34:56.137
He means Ace Chemicals.

34:57.638 --> 34:59.849
You promise me.

35:01.058 --> 35:02.893
I'll bring her back.

35:05.646 --> 35:07.565
(door opens)

35:07.648 --> 35:09.233
(door closes)

35:12.403 --> 35:14.864
JEREMIAH:
Come along, Commissioner.

35:14.947 --> 35:16.574
We're waiting.

35:17.366 --> 35:18.492
The party's raging,

35:18.576 --> 35:22.038
but it's well past the
princess's bedtime.

35:23.831 --> 35:25.916
It's funny, being back here.

35:27.168 --> 35:29.545
I can still
feel my flesh

35:30.338 --> 35:33.549
sizzle
as it melted away.

35:33.633 --> 35:35.134
Burns even now.

35:35.217 --> 35:37.261
Ooh. Oh.

35:37.345 --> 35:38.262
(screams)

35:39.764 --> 35:41.223
I'm here.

35:41.307 --> 35:42.975
Everything's gonna be fine.

35:43.059 --> 35:44.935
You think so?

35:45.019 --> 35:48.356
Personally, I'd say things are
about as far away from fine

35:48.439 --> 35:50.650
as they could possibly be,
Barbara Lee.

35:50.733 --> 35:54.445
What do I know? I did just
spend the last ten years

35:54.528 --> 35:56.489
in the funny farm.
(giggles)

35:56.572 --> 35:58.741
What do you want,
Jeremiah?

36:00.910 --> 36:03.621
Is there a Jeremiah here?

36:05.081 --> 36:06.832
So what do I call you?

36:06.916 --> 36:07.917
Uh...

36:08.000 --> 36:09.627
I don't know.

36:09.710 --> 36:11.837
Call me... Jack.

36:11.921 --> 36:13.172
Mm, no, no, no,
that's not right.

36:13.255 --> 36:15.341
J-Joseph. John. Jay.

36:15.424 --> 36:16.926
L-I don't know. I just--

36:17.009 --> 36:19.929
I feel something
new crawling

36:20.012 --> 36:22.139
from the primordial ooze
that was me.

36:22.223 --> 36:23.683
Something...

36:23.766 --> 36:25.685
beautiful.

36:26.686 --> 36:28.896
How long have you been
pretending to be brain-dead?

36:28.979 --> 36:31.399
How long have you
been pretending?

36:31.482 --> 36:33.609
That's a joke. I know
you're not pretending.

36:33.693 --> 36:35.236
That's far enough, James.

36:36.153 --> 36:37.738
(clucks)

36:38.531 --> 36:41.325
GORDON: But you still
haven't told me.

36:42.868 --> 36:44.328
Why?

36:45.287 --> 36:47.248
<i>'MW Keep pretending'?</i>

36:48.332 --> 36:52.002
I was waiting for him
to come home.

36:52.670 --> 36:55.464
We're bound
together, he and I.

36:56.424 --> 36:58.634
It's the one thing I knew
for certain, the one thing

36:58.718 --> 37:00.845
I knew was true.

37:01.762 --> 37:03.347
And then he just...

37:03.431 --> 37:05.850
abandoned us.

37:06.434 --> 37:09.019
Do you know how it feels
to have the one,

37:09.103 --> 37:11.397
the only thing you love

37:11.480 --> 37:13.190
ripped away from you?

37:14.984 --> 37:16.235
It feels like this.

38:33.395 --> 38:36.440
saves you and Barbara Lee,

38:36.524 --> 38:38.400

38:38.484 --> 38:39.485
Yeah.

38:39.568 --> 38:41.737
So, the dude's on our side?

38:41.821 --> 38:44.031
I think so.

38:44.114 --> 38:46.492
Hey, this old thing.

38:47.326 --> 38:50.788
I thought we, uh, mothballed
this after reunification.

38:50.871 --> 38:52.248
I had 'em dig it out

38:52.331 --> 38:53.916
for old times' sake.

38:53.999 --> 38:56.168
I sent a note to Wayne Manor.

38:56.252 --> 38:59.463
I thought Bruce might want
to be here when we light it.

39:07.638 --> 39:09.056
Good evening, gentlemen.

39:09.640 --> 39:12.852
Master Bruce sends
his profound apologies.

39:12.935 --> 39:15.104
He's otherwise engaged.

39:15.646 --> 39:18.023
He's been busy a lot
since he came back.

39:18.107 --> 39:19.441
Yes, indeed.

39:20.067 --> 39:22.486
And I hear that you're retiring.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.031

what you did...

to protect me.

40:31.013 --> 40:32.640
But I didn't want
to be protected.

40:32.723 --> 40:35.059
I wanted you.

40:38.771 --> 40:40.731
Say something.

40:40.814 --> 40:43.275

Say something.

40:44.860 --> 40:47.112
There was no
other way, Selina.

40:48.739 --> 40:50.699
I had to go.

40:54.203 --> 40:56.789
So what happens now?

40:57.456 --> 40:59.291
I don't know.

leave Gotham again.

41:15.307 --> 41:16.809

"Gotham is mine."
That's what he said.

41:25.734 --> 41:27.027
I was there, Oswald.

41:27.111 --> 41:29.613
I did not spend ten years
in Blackgate

41:29.697 --> 41:32.491
to give my city to a man
dressed like a bat!

41:32.574 --> 41:33.826
Yes!

41:35.119 --> 41:37.287
Go!

41:42.876 --> 41:44.586
We have to find out
who he is

41:44.670 --> 41:46.630
and show him that this
is our city!

41:46.714 --> 41:47.715
Agreed.

41:47.798 --> 41:48.924
(gasps)

41:59.768 --> 42:01.562
Tomorrow?

42:03.147 --> 42:05.190
Tomorrow.

42:14.533 --> 42:16.076
Yet in the darkness,

42:17.161 --> 42:19.163
there will be light.

42:21.498 --> 42:22.791
That's what you
promised Master Bruce

42:22.875 --> 42:24.668
all those years
ago in the alley.

42:26.545 --> 42:28.881
You saved him.

42:29.715 --> 42:31.717
Gave him hope.

42:36.513 --> 42:38.682
Holy Mother.

42:45.355 --> 42:48.776
<i>HTS'</i>

42:55.157 --> 42:56.742
Who is he?

43:00.037 --> 43:02.247
A friend.

43:02.331 --> 43:04.625
