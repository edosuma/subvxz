WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.436
Last time on,
Make It Pop

00:02.470 --> 00:04.138
I don't wanna
see your band,

00:04.172 --> 00:05.239
or hear a single
note of it ever again.

00:05.273 --> 00:07.007
This is serious with
no rehearsal space

00:07.041 --> 00:08.976
there is no band,
with no band,

00:09.009 --> 00:11.979
Sun-Hi can't be the star,
and if Sun-Hi can't be the star

00:12.012 --> 00:13.047
Is she gonna
explode, or?

00:13.081 --> 00:13.781
(screaming)

00:13.814 --> 00:17.451
Way to kill the
dream, Caleb.

00:17.485 --> 00:18.586
Jodi, wait!!!

00:18.619 --> 00:20.988
I can make this club huge,
I can make this band huge!

00:21.021 --> 00:22.856
And I will!

00:22.890 --> 00:24.492
Pretty soon.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.860
Pretty sure.

00:26.894 --> 00:28.862
Maybe.

00:28.896 --> 00:29.963
Yeah.

00:29.997 --> 00:31.965
I knew there wouldn't be
a stage at a roller rink.

00:31.999 --> 00:33.434
But there is one!

00:33.467 --> 00:36.504
Well, at least his
lie is factual.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.939
In the last century,
bands would tour in buses

00:38.972 --> 00:40.908
and play at bowling
alleys, skating rinks,

00:40.941 --> 00:42.876
basically wherever
the kids were.

00:42.910 --> 00:49.283
And, clearly they
weren't here.

00:49.317 --> 00:49.883
What?

00:49.917 --> 00:51.985
I know some
things too.

00:52.019 --> 01:01.929
*

01:01.962 --> 01:03.964
You still
like me, right?

01:06.967 --> 01:09.903
Noon today, Mr. Stark
announces the school play.

01:09.937 --> 01:11.905
I hope it's a
one-man show.

01:11.939 --> 01:13.107
I'd be great
in that.

01:13.141 --> 01:14.908
That seems like
a lot of work.

01:14.942 --> 01:17.811
It is, but I'm a
trained actor.

01:17.845 --> 01:19.947
Chin exercises
are the secret.

01:19.980 --> 01:22.950
Too bad freshman can't get
any good roles in the play.

01:22.983 --> 01:24.818
They only let you
be plants, rocks,

01:24.852 --> 01:26.320
an occasional
primate if you're lucky.

01:26.354 --> 01:27.455
It's okay.

01:27.488 --> 01:30.158
Being center stage isn't
something I'm comfortable with.

01:30.191 --> 01:31.992
Life is a stage.

01:32.025 --> 01:35.396
Which is awesome,
if your me.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.030
Off to the
weight room.

01:37.064 --> 01:39.500
This chin doesn't
hold itself up.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.202
See you later.

01:44.338 --> 01:47.040
Unique New York,
Unique New York

01:48.376 --> 01:55.082
Students, today is the day
you have been waiting for.

01:55.115 --> 01:58.519
This year's MacKendrick
Prep High School musical,

01:58.552 --> 02:02.956
written, directed, and
produced by myself is,

02:02.990 --> 02:06.026
Mr. Millwood Stark is...

02:10.063 --> 02:13.066
The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz!

02:13.100 --> 02:14.101
Yes!

02:14.134 --> 02:15.603
Yes!

02:15.636 --> 02:16.537
What!?

02:16.570 --> 02:18.906
I can't be Dorothy!

02:18.939 --> 02:20.374
Argghhhh!!!!

02:20.408 --> 02:21.975
Fabulous costumes,

02:22.009 --> 02:23.143
Good music.

02:23.177 --> 02:25.946
Awesome lead!

02:25.979 --> 02:29.082
* Make it pop, Woo, woo

02:29.116 --> 02:32.986
* Make it pop, Woo, woo

02:33.020 --> 02:36.290
* I can't wait,
no I can't wait, no *

02:36.324 --> 02:39.159
* I can't wait,
no I can't wait *

02:39.193 --> 02:42.596
* So make it pop, we're bout
to, we're bout to blow *

02:42.630 --> 02:45.999
* Until we drop, oh ya,
we're ready to go *

02:46.033 --> 02:49.203
* Ain't gonna stop,
when is it time for the show *

02:49.237 --> 02:51.972
* We make it, you make it,
they make it *

02:52.005 --> 02:54.675
* M-m-m-m-m-m-
Make it pop *

02:56.677 --> 02:59.980
*

03:00.013 --> 03:03.451
Design costumes
for school musical, rad!

03:03.484 --> 03:05.619
Well, I'm going
to be Dorothy.

03:05.653 --> 03:08.256
And you two can be my
sidekick Munchkins.

03:08.289 --> 03:09.990
The sidekicks
are not Munchkins.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.692
They're three physical
representations of different

03:11.725 --> 03:16.530
intangible
shortcomings, duh!

03:16.564 --> 03:17.465
What?

03:17.498 --> 03:19.233
Everyone knows that.

03:19.267 --> 03:22.370
I think her point was that
she's going to be the star.

03:22.403 --> 03:26.340
That's pretty much always
my point when I'm talking.

03:26.374 --> 03:28.709
Also, I want us to
audition as a trio.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.811
Do they let people
audition as trios?

03:30.844 --> 03:32.580
We're trendsetters.

03:32.613 --> 03:35.349
We'll do a full-on performance
with costumes and lights.

03:35.383 --> 03:38.085
Once it goes viral and
millions of people see it,

03:38.118 --> 03:40.087
they'll have to cast
us as the leads.

03:40.120 --> 03:43.291
Sun-Hi you have a gift of
making insane plans seem doable.

03:43.324 --> 03:44.792
Don't ruin my drama.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.159
(whimpers)

03:47.428 --> 03:49.297
Okay, toodles.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.163
Look, Stark.

03:50.197 --> 03:52.266
This better not be a
replay of last year.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.834
Are you talking about
my production of

03:53.867 --> 03:55.769
"Les Mis: The Comedy"?

03:55.803 --> 03:58.171
That was a masterpiece.

03:58.205 --> 04:00.574
Not if you were
in the audience.

04:00.608 --> 04:01.809
Ouch.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.744
I've never liked
this time of year.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.579
Children singing and
dancing in the halls.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.748
Parents incessantly
asking why their little

04:07.781 --> 04:10.150
Tommy or Sloane
didn't get the lead.

04:10.183 --> 04:13.120
Constant disappointment is
one of the joys of theater.

04:13.153 --> 04:15.489
(laughing)

04:15.523 --> 04:18.626
If your Oz is another disaster
for the theater department

04:18.659 --> 04:23.664
you'll be joyful all the way
to the unemployment office.

04:23.697 --> 04:27.368
I'm looking to tear
down the auditorium.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.803
I'd like to put in a
new Aquatic Center.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.805
It's sink or swim,
Stark.

04:31.839 --> 04:36.877
Or, more accurately,
if you sink, I swim.

04:36.910 --> 04:40.213
(laughing)

04:40.247 --> 04:40.748
Get out!

04:40.781 --> 04:41.415
Right.

04:48.221 --> 04:49.857
The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz!?

04:49.890 --> 04:51.692
It's about two girls!

04:51.725 --> 04:53.193
And they're fighting
over shoes!

04:53.226 --> 04:56.263
Mr. Stark, this play
is important to me!

04:56.296 --> 04:58.899
It's important to
everyone, Jared.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.934
There's always the Wizard.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.771
You mean that bald round headed
guy who doesn't show up

05:03.804 --> 05:05.606
until the second act?

05:05.639 --> 05:08.542
What a waste of
a perfect chin.

05:08.576 --> 05:10.778
Look, I get it.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.513
You like this play.

05:12.546 --> 05:15.583
It helped you through your
awkward phase in high school.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.851
I was different,
so what?

05:17.885 --> 05:19.720
Genius always is.

05:19.753 --> 05:22.523
The point is,
I can work with it.

05:22.556 --> 05:24.892
Let's re-write this entire
thing make Dorothy more

05:24.925 --> 05:29.229
of a masculine presence
who's name is, Dennis.

05:29.262 --> 05:30.564
The book is
written, Jared.

05:30.598 --> 05:32.500
You can audition
like everyone else.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.568
Remember there
are no small parts,

05:34.602 --> 05:36.269
just small actors.

05:36.303 --> 05:40.273
Especially in this case,
we have Munchkins,

05:40.307 --> 05:42.476
a lot of them.

05:42.943 --> 05:44.645
Munchkins?

05:44.678 --> 05:46.714
I'm the biggest
man on this campus!

05:46.747 --> 05:50.984
*

05:54.021 --> 05:55.823
Just in time.

05:55.856 --> 05:58.659
Try the tin-wood man.

05:58.692 --> 05:59.292
Can't.

05:59.326 --> 06:03.597
It's our first math test.

06:03.631 --> 06:06.467
You guys do know,
we have a test now.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.000
Right?

06:07.034 --> 06:07.968
That's next week.

06:08.001 --> 06:08.802
No.

06:08.836 --> 06:10.838
it's in three minutes.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.407
Can't wait!

06:13.441 --> 06:14.575
Don't panic.

06:14.608 --> 06:17.244
We'll just say that we've
come down with Geometric plague.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.015
I can't see.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.351
Math test,
get changed Sun-Hi.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.020
Is anyone there?

06:27.054 --> 06:28.388
Hey!

06:28.422 --> 06:31.358
* Get it right or
do it all again. *

06:31.391 --> 06:35.328
* This time round I'll
be better than I used to be *

06:35.362 --> 06:40.067
* I wanna see if I'm
ready for the big time *

06:40.100 --> 06:43.036
* Runnin for my life,

06:43.070 --> 06:48.442
* Havin too much fun
hangin out with everyone *

06:48.476 --> 06:52.045

you're being young *

06:52.079 --> 06:57.451
* Life is but a test I ain't
failing it, only just begun *

06:57.485 --> 07:00.420
* So tell me what you
would've done *

07:00.454 --> 07:04.558

beating like a drum *

07:07.094 --> 07:10.363

* Running through my
head, all the things I've read *

07:46.166 --> 07:51.138

08:43.123 --> 08:45.626
* (Day night get it right)

08:45.659 --> 08:47.628
What'd you name the
triangle for question three?

08:47.661 --> 08:50.530
Ricardo, but I
was just guessing.

08:50.564 --> 08:52.532
Argh math, why do
we even need it?

08:52.566 --> 08:54.101
What do they think
computers are for?

08:54.134 --> 08:55.603
I so blew it.

08:55.636 --> 08:58.171
Hey, girls, hey!

08:58.205 --> 09:01.308
You know what I love
the most about you three?

09:01.341 --> 09:04.812
How forgiving you all are.

09:04.845 --> 09:05.713
Okay, look.

09:05.746 --> 09:09.116
I just wanted to
say that I'm sorry.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.751
So sorry.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.986
So, so sorry.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.888
Caleb!

09:14.922 --> 09:18.626
Desperation is not
a good look for you.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.027
I'm can to fix this.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.895
I still believe that,
if combined,

09:21.929 --> 09:26.333
your talent, plus mine.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.235
Mind blowing.

09:28.268 --> 09:29.703
So, what do you say?

09:29.737 --> 09:32.172
I'm trying out
for the orchestra.

09:32.205 --> 09:34.341
I have a slight touch
of geometric plague.

09:34.374 --> 09:36.810
(coughs)

09:36.844 --> 09:39.913
Let us know if the roller rink
ever becomes an actual club.

09:39.947 --> 09:43.250
*

09:43.283 --> 09:45.218
Stop the Munchkins!

09:45.252 --> 09:46.286
Aunt Em, and
Uncle Henry?

09:46.319 --> 09:48.388
Uh, no thanks.

09:48.421 --> 09:52.726
If you need brains, courage
and heart, look no further.

09:52.760 --> 09:55.228
Come on,
Freshmen, man up.

09:55.262 --> 09:58.231
or woman up and sign
my petition to stop Oz.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.833
Not a chance.

09:59.867 --> 10:01.234
Oz'll be great with girls.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.637
We're auditioning as a trio.

10:03.671 --> 10:05.238
Corki, I was really
counting on you.

10:05.272 --> 10:05.973
You were?

10:06.006 --> 10:07.941
It would mean
so much to me,

10:07.975 --> 10:12.245
to have you stand by
my side on this issue.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.314
And besides the three of you
auditioning together

10:14.347 --> 10:16.083
is a terrible idea.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.117
Why?

10:17.150 --> 10:20.287
Trust me, the orchestra
is where you want to be.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.957
Preferably playing music for a
show about a strong male lead.

10:23.991 --> 10:30.430
*

10:30.463 --> 10:31.431
Failed!

10:31.464 --> 10:32.700
What does that mean?

10:32.733 --> 10:33.901
It means...

10:33.934 --> 10:36.136
"Due to a lower than sixty two
percent of correct answers

10:36.169 --> 10:37.370
you have failed."

10:37.404 --> 10:39.773
I was worried
that's what it meant.

10:39.807 --> 10:40.841
Excellent.

10:40.874 --> 10:42.710
Nothing is
excellent right now.

10:42.743 --> 10:43.711
My test score is.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.378
One hundred percent.

10:45.412 --> 10:46.880
Right or wrong?

10:46.914 --> 10:48.982
Right, of course.

10:49.016 --> 10:51.151
Who does that?

10:51.184 --> 10:52.853
Why, what did
you guys get?

10:52.886 --> 10:53.787
We failed.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.856
And we, "are now on
academic probation."

10:55.889 --> 10:57.057
What does that mean?

10:57.090 --> 10:59.392
It means we,
"can't audition for the play."

10:59.426 --> 11:01.094
Okay, stop.

11:01.128 --> 11:04.031
Every time you read something,
it just gets worse.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.168
*

11:08.201 --> 11:11.238
How am I supposed to get world
famous if I can't even audition

11:11.271 --> 11:12.873
for a high school musical?

11:12.906 --> 11:14.107
Forget the musical.

11:14.141 --> 11:15.976
I just failed my
first test here.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.978
You two worry too much.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.246
What are you talking about?

11:19.279 --> 11:21.248
If this was you,
you'd be a mess.

11:21.281 --> 11:24.251
If this were me, the teacher
would've made a grading mistake.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.253
You're not
helping, Corki.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.220
Sorry.

11:27.254 --> 11:29.957
Why don't you just
petition for a make-up test?

11:29.990 --> 11:31.158
You can do that?

11:31.191 --> 11:34.795
Yeah, didn't you guys read the
MacKendrick Prep handbook?

11:34.828 --> 11:36.797
We were supposed
to memorize it.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.498
Do you do everything
that you're told?

11:38.531 --> 11:40.333
Yes.

11:40.367 --> 11:43.136
Every student is entitled to one
make up test per semester

11:43.170 --> 11:45.205
within twenty four hours of
the original test.

11:45.238 --> 11:46.406
That's perfect!

11:46.439 --> 11:49.176
We'll do a make-up test, then
all get parts in the play.

11:49.209 --> 11:52.412
The train to fame is
back on the tracks, people!

11:52.445 --> 11:53.814
Now, come on!

11:53.847 --> 11:55.348
Let's go pass this
science test!

11:55.382 --> 11:56.283
It's math.

11:56.316 --> 11:59.052
Close enough.

11:59.086 --> 12:02.155
Randy, Rando, sir.

12:03.356 --> 12:06.159
I realize, that as my boss,
you don't need advice

12:06.193 --> 12:08.195
from a high schooler,

12:08.228 --> 12:12.365
But I still believe I can fill
this place, and I know it.

12:12.399 --> 12:15.068
A teen dance club.

12:15.102 --> 12:16.636
Think about it.

12:16.669 --> 12:19.539
Really, that's great.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.175
And I'm fired if
it doesn't work.

12:22.209 --> 12:23.243
Understood.

12:25.445 --> 12:26.346
Yes!

12:26.379 --> 12:30.150
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to wake you.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.251
As you were.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.989
Sun-Hi: What's A?

12:36.023 --> 12:39.226
X equals A, over four,
plus two.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.393
What's A?

12:40.427 --> 12:41.895
Who cares?

12:41.929 --> 12:42.629
Next.

12:45.032 --> 12:49.502
Oh, oh,
uh-oh, ahh!

12:51.538 --> 12:52.906
It's okay.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.207
I'm fine.

12:54.241 --> 12:56.209
The paint broke my fall.

12:56.243 --> 12:58.511
If seven is to five
and X is to three.

12:58.545 --> 12:59.980
What is X?

13:01.214 --> 13:02.282
X is stupid.

13:02.315 --> 13:03.450
That's what it is.

13:05.352 --> 13:06.987
X is four-point-two.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.956
You cross multiply
and divide.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.991
Simple, ugh!

13:12.459 --> 13:14.261
What kind of number
is four-point-two?

13:17.730 --> 13:21.468
(buzzing)

13:21.501 --> 13:22.435
Come on.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.236
Uh-oh.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.007
(coughing)

13:27.040 --> 13:28.341
I guess I asked for that.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.643
So cold!

13:30.677 --> 13:31.444
(coughs)

13:32.379 --> 13:33.346
Sun Hi?

13:33.380 --> 13:35.182
I got nothing.

13:35.215 --> 13:36.149
We're dead.

13:36.183 --> 13:38.718
So dead.

13:38.751 --> 13:40.988
Alright,
I'll help you.

13:41.021 --> 13:41.621
Really?

13:41.654 --> 13:43.256
That's so nice!

13:43.290 --> 13:44.191
Who knew?

13:44.224 --> 13:46.626
I'm not being nice,
I'm being pragmatic.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.661
If I don't help you,
you'll fail.

13:48.695 --> 13:50.663
Which means no auditions,
which means no show.

13:50.697 --> 13:53.666
I'll never get any sleep, if you
two don't have something else

13:53.700 --> 13:55.635
to do other
than schoolwork.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.070
She is smart.

13:57.104 --> 13:58.271
Yeah.

13:58.305 --> 13:59.106
Thanks, Corki.

13:59.139 --> 14:00.273
You haven't passed yet.

14:02.309 --> 14:04.277
And by the way,
this is all wrong.

14:04.311 --> 14:08.315
*

14:08.348 --> 14:11.451
(buzzing)

14:11.484 --> 14:12.552
Hmm.

14:12.585 --> 14:16.289
This electricity stuff is
trickier than I thought.

14:16.323 --> 14:20.527
*

14:20.560 --> 14:22.229
Corki: So, how'd it go?

14:22.262 --> 14:23.396
I definitely did better.

14:23.430 --> 14:24.364
Not sure.

14:24.397 --> 14:25.632
Well, you'll know
soon enough.

14:25.665 --> 14:26.466
(cellphone dings)

14:27.367 --> 14:28.468
It's Caleb.

14:28.501 --> 14:29.736
He wants to see us.

14:29.769 --> 14:31.404
Yeah good luck
with that.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.306
I'm never talking
to him again.

14:33.340 --> 14:34.241
I am.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.809
Besides, you have
something better to do?

14:36.843 --> 14:38.111
You're right,
let's go.

14:38.145 --> 14:45.818
*

14:45.852 --> 14:48.321
Jodi: Check
this out!

14:48.355 --> 14:49.322
Sick!

14:49.356 --> 14:51.291
Wow, amazing.

14:51.324 --> 14:54.627
It actually
looks like a club.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.529
I know, right?

14:56.563 --> 14:58.298
Look, I believein
you guys, in us--

14:58.331 --> 14:59.332
(cellphone dings)

14:59.366 --> 15:01.501
--in what
we can be together.

15:01.534 --> 15:02.602
We passed.

15:02.635 --> 15:05.172
What, really?

15:05.205 --> 15:06.473
What are you doing?

15:06.506 --> 15:08.241
Sharing in your joy.

15:08.275 --> 15:09.809
Too much?

15:09.842 --> 15:12.345
I'll let it slide this time.

15:12.379 --> 15:15.348
So are we a band, or what?

15:15.382 --> 15:17.717
Sun-Hi: Yeah.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.553
But only if Corki
sings with us.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.355
I thought you
didn't want me.

15:22.389 --> 15:23.190
I like you now.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.525
That's what you
get for helping me.

15:25.558 --> 15:30.597
Corki, Corki,
please, please, please!

15:30.630 --> 15:33.300
Fine, as long as you
don't go putting my face

15:33.333 --> 15:34.401
all over the internet.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.135
But why--

15:35.168 --> 15:37.937
And no,
I won't tell you why.

15:37.971 --> 15:39.272
Okay, you got a beat?

15:39.306 --> 15:40.240
Always.

15:40.273 --> 15:43.910
Wait, give me
ten minutes.

15:43.943 --> 15:47.480
fifteen, twenty,
thirty minutes, tops.

15:51.651 --> 15:55.222
Three, two, one.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.490
* What's up, there's
something in the air *

15:57.524 --> 16:00.760
* It's that feeling when
the weekend comes *

16:00.793 --> 16:02.895
* Say what you
doing way up there *

16:02.929 --> 16:05.598
* I think that we
could have some fun *

16:05.632 --> 16:07.267
* I know this place
that we could go *

16:07.300 --> 16:09.302
* We're not invited
but who cares *

16:09.336 --> 16:11.571
* We girls are
putting on a show *

16:11.604 --> 16:15.375
* There's so much
happening out there *

16:15.408 --> 16:17.410
* Out there

16:17.444 --> 16:19.312
* Out there

16:19.346 --> 16:21.548
* Party People!

16:21.581 --> 16:25.718
* Do whatever, ever, ever,
be whatever, ever, ever *

16:25.752 --> 16:28.588
* Dance forever,
ever, ever, ever *

16:28.621 --> 16:32.925
* So climb out your window,
'cause we're waiting for you *

16:32.959 --> 16:37.364
* We're gonna party

16:37.397 --> 16:41.301
* We'll go crash a party,
call up everybody *

16:41.334 --> 16:45.338
* We're gonna party
tonight oh-oh-oh *

16:45.372 --> 16:49.509
* Forget what your head says,
we're young and we love it *

16:49.542 --> 16:53.580
* We can do whatever
we like, oh-oh-oh *

16:53.613 --> 16:57.750
* So climb out your window,
'caus we're waiting for you *

16:57.784 --> 17:00.387

* We're gonna party tonight

17:03.523 --> 17:05.325
* Hook all your friends
up with a text *

17:05.358 --> 17:07.494
* We'll turn some speakers
up and dance *

17:07.527 --> 17:09.262
* Break rules with Charlie,
XCX *

17:09.296 --> 17:11.498
* And throw stuff up on
Instagram *

17:11.531 --> 17:13.500
* Set fireworks off
in the parks *

17:13.533 --> 17:15.768
* And watch them
lighting up the air *

17:15.802 --> 17:17.770
* We'll crash out
underneath the stars *

17:17.804 --> 17:20.073
* There's so much
happening out there *

17:20.107 --> 17:23.476
* Out there

17:51.571 --> 17:55.642

* Do whatever, ever, ever
Be whatever, ever, ever *

18:05.185 --> 18:11.057
* Dance forever,
ever, ever, ever *

18:11.090 --> 18:12.625
That was amazing!

18:12.659 --> 18:15.027
I like a performance
with no audience.

18:15.061 --> 18:16.028
Yeah...

18:16.062 --> 18:19.065
These costumes
are sick.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.567
I'm just getting started.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.802
That was a great
song, have any more?

18:22.835 --> 18:23.736
Hundreds!

18:23.770 --> 18:26.439
Well, twenty, but
I've got a lot of ideas.

18:26.473 --> 18:27.640
(cellphone ringing)

18:27.674 --> 18:30.042
Oh, that's Randy,
my boss.

18:30.076 --> 18:31.110
I think I'm fired.

18:33.079 --> 18:35.215
*

18:35.248 --> 18:37.984
(cellphone ringing)

18:38.017 --> 18:41.821
Ah, H-h-hello, sir.

18:41.854 --> 18:44.657
Before you say anything,
I've got some good news

18:44.691 --> 18:46.659
and I've got
some bad news.

18:46.693 --> 18:50.530
The good news is there's
no longer a hole in the wall.

18:50.563 --> 18:55.001
The bad news is, well,
there's no longer a wall either.

18:55.034 --> 18:57.537
Oh, and with the singing
and dancing business,

18:57.570 --> 18:59.539
Yes, I know
it was loud but,

18:59.572 --> 19:00.607
Mm-hm.

19:00.640 --> 19:01.608
Mmmm-hm.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.109
Oh, yes, sir.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.511
Mhm, mhm.

19:04.544 --> 19:05.245
Okay, sir.

19:05.278 --> 19:06.646
(dial tone)

19:06.679 --> 19:07.514
Sir?

19:10.983 --> 19:12.685
He liked what he saw.

19:12.719 --> 19:16.022
He says we can put a show
on here, on Friday night.

19:16.055 --> 19:17.089
Ugh, with people?

19:17.123 --> 19:19.526
If I was someone else,
say with a different body,

19:19.559 --> 19:20.560
and brain,

19:20.593 --> 19:22.295
I think I could
almost kiss you!

19:22.329 --> 19:23.230
Thanks?

19:23.263 --> 19:24.264
I said almost!

19:24.297 --> 19:25.498
Right, I knew that.

19:25.532 --> 19:30.237
Ok listen, If the show goes
well, we can be the house band.

19:30.270 --> 19:32.572
If it doesn't, I'm fired.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.241
We'll tell everybody!

19:34.274 --> 19:36.276
What do we
call ourselves?

19:36.309 --> 19:38.010
Let's think of
something right now.

19:38.044 --> 19:39.679
The Invisibles?

19:39.712 --> 19:40.413
Can't see it.

19:40.447 --> 19:42.549
Ooh, the
"The Fashionista Gals?"

19:42.582 --> 19:43.950
Out of style.

19:43.983 --> 19:46.953
What about, "Sun-Hi and
Her Back-Up Singers?"

19:46.986 --> 19:49.188
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

19:49.222 --> 19:51.758
Just spit-balling,
sheesh.

19:51.791 --> 19:54.227
We need a name that reflects
all our unique talents.

19:54.261 --> 19:56.563
Let's see,
I play the violin.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.598
Sun-Hi's, a social
media expert.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.333
Jodi got the costumes
and the choreography.

20:00.367 --> 20:03.570
And Caleb's
got the beats.

20:03.603 --> 20:06.706
The Sun-Hi Quartet!??

20:06.739 --> 20:08.275
I can see this band
naming thing

20:08.308 --> 20:10.977
is going to be a little
problematic.

20:11.010 --> 20:13.179
Why I kinda liked it?

20:13.212 --> 20:14.414
*

20:14.447 --> 20:16.649
I can't believe Caleb actually
came through with that club.

20:16.683 --> 20:17.650
I know.

20:17.684 --> 20:19.352
He's more amazing than
we gave him credit for.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.087
Yoooooou like him.

20:21.120 --> 20:21.854
No, I don't.

20:21.888 --> 20:22.622
You like him.

20:22.655 --> 20:23.390
No, I don't.

20:23.423 --> 20:24.156
You like him!

20:24.190 --> 20:25.858
Enough!

20:25.892 --> 20:26.293
She does.

20:26.326 --> 20:27.627
I know, right?

20:27.660 --> 20:29.362
Ready, ok, we have.

20:29.396 --> 20:31.197
Up, down, down,
arm, arm,

20:31.230 --> 20:32.932
circle around,
and look.

20:32.965 --> 20:35.001
Ball change, kick.

20:35.034 --> 20:37.770
Gooooooooo, beagles!

20:37.804 --> 20:40.273
How was that, good?

20:40.307 --> 20:41.374
Down hey, down hey

20:41.408 --> 20:42.642
Down hey, down hey

20:42.675 --> 20:45.111
Untz, untz, untz

20:45.144 --> 20:48.214
Heeeeey, hah,
Ou hah!

20:48.247 --> 20:50.182
Ou, hay!

20:50.216 --> 20:52.018
Not bad, Noobie.

20:52.051 --> 20:53.386
Ever considered
joining the Spirit Squad?

20:53.420 --> 20:55.254
Oh, no thanks.

20:55.288 --> 20:56.823
With the band
and school,

20:56.856 --> 21:01.894
I don't know if I can be
so peppy all the time.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.863
Was that supposed
to be funny?

21:03.896 --> 21:06.032
Look, there are
rules around here.

21:06.065 --> 21:07.300
A pecking order.

21:07.334 --> 21:11.371
You may not have figured that
out yet but trust me, you will.

21:11.404 --> 21:12.405
Okay.

21:12.439 --> 21:14.307
Well, that
wasn't very peppy.

21:14.341 --> 21:16.208
C'mon, let's get
out of here.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.247
I do not like
those girls.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.882
That makes two of us.

21:22.915 --> 21:26.052
And maybe more, if other people
don't like them as well.

21:26.085 --> 21:28.054
So, what are you
gonna do about it?

21:28.087 --> 21:29.889
I don't know.

21:29.922 --> 21:32.425
But I always
think of something.

21:32.459 --> 21:33.426
She does.
