WEBVTT

00:03.229 --> 00:07.231
- I understand your attempt
to reach a plea bargain failed.

00:07.249 --> 00:09.416
- The State has made
multiple offers

00:09.568 --> 00:12.011
which the defendant
has refused to accept.

00:12.162 --> 00:13.737
- Counsel, have you explained
to your client

00:13.756 --> 00:16.765
that the charges he's facing
carry mandatory prison time.

00:17.667 --> 00:18.976
- I have, Your Honor.

00:21.689 --> 00:24.748
- Mr. Tamura, are you sure
you want to proceed?

00:25.251 --> 00:28.110
- Yes, Your Honor.
I'm sure.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.922
- Alright then, we'll take
a short recess

00:31.940 --> 00:34.742
and bring the jury
in for a noon start.

00:48.532 --> 00:51.592
- My mother was
a selfless woman,

00:53.054 --> 00:55.203
devoted to our family,

00:55.964 --> 00:59.541
and especially to my big
brother, Osamu.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.210
(emotional music)

01:02.229 --> 01:04.480
I never heard her complain,

01:05.900 --> 01:07.274
not once.

01:09.052 --> 01:11.737
Which is how she lived her life.

01:12.464 --> 01:17.159
You know, most people talk
about "gratitude"

01:18.804 --> 01:20.637
but my mother lived it.

01:21.565 --> 01:24.750
Instead of dwelling on what
was painful or difficult,

01:24.827 --> 01:30.130
she grabbed every moment of
grace and beauty she could.

01:33.076 --> 01:36.178
She was my brother's
full-time caregiver,

01:38.991 --> 01:44.561
but she also always found time
to be with her granddaughters,

01:46.165 --> 01:48.065
who gave her so much joy.

01:52.171 --> 01:55.197
(indistinct chatter)

01:57.434 --> 01:59.100
- Look what we got you, Ojisan.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.677
It's a tablet.

02:00.679 --> 02:02.955
Can you say tablet?

02:03.031 --> 02:04.456
(stuttering): T-tablet.

02:04.533 --> 02:07.459
- That's right. That's good.
It's easy to work it.

02:07.536 --> 02:10.187
You just have to swipe
with your finger, like this.

02:10.205 --> 02:12.714
See how easy it is?
Here, you try.

02:13.450 --> 02:14.782
If you ever feel lonely,

02:14.802 --> 02:17.678
you can look at pictures
of Obaachan whenever you want.

02:20.532 --> 02:23.183
- Come on, honey, you can
show him in the car.

02:25.888 --> 02:28.564
(soft music)

02:35.397 --> 02:38.048
Okay, say goodbye
to Ojisan, girls.

02:38.050 --> 02:40.659
- Bye. See ya.

02:41.662 --> 02:42.644
- We'll see you soon.

02:43.480 --> 02:46.165
I'll bring you Bento like
Obaachan used to make.

02:47.393 --> 02:48.584
- Bye.

03:01.498 --> 03:04.382
- How old was Ojisan when
he had the accident?

03:04.535 --> 03:05.926
- Nine.

03:06.078 --> 03:07.853
- So, my age.

03:07.930 --> 03:09.188
- Yeah.

03:11.250 --> 03:13.192
- Does he know Obaachan is dead?

03:14.603 --> 03:16.278
- Of course he does.

03:19.107 --> 03:20.741
- Does he feel sad?

03:22.277 --> 03:27.522
- Ojisan can't always express
himself, but he feels things.

03:27.541 --> 03:30.100
He loves you two very much,
you know that right?

03:30.118 --> 03:31.284
- I love him too.

03:32.028 --> 03:33.712
- Of course you do.
He's our uncle.

03:33.789 --> 03:36.548
- Layla, please don't talk
to your sister that way.

03:37.534 --> 03:39.176
- Whatever.

03:42.223 --> 03:44.264
- Why can't he just
live with us?

03:47.135 --> 03:49.786
- You know why, sweetheart.

03:49.788 --> 03:51.063
Right?

03:53.234 --> 03:54.691
(sighs)

03:58.480 --> 03:59.905
- It's nice here.

04:01.133 --> 04:04.801
Oh, maybe you can try some
of the activities.

04:05.804 --> 04:09.998
Have you met any new people
or made any friends?

04:11.401 --> 04:14.253
(♪♪)

04:20.910 --> 04:23.262
- Hey, Sam, you gonna tell him?

04:23.413 --> 04:25.822
Hmm? You gonna tell him?
- Hey, hey, hey.

04:25.841 --> 04:27.173
- You gonna tell him?
- Easy. Easy.

04:27.250 --> 04:29.175
- You gonna tell him?
- What? Whoa, whoa.

04:29.328 --> 04:30.844
- You gonna tell him?
- Easy

04:30.996 --> 04:32.512
- You gonna tell him?
- What?

04:32.664 --> 04:36.233
What's he talking about?
Tell me what?

04:37.761 --> 04:39.169
Sam?

04:39.187 --> 04:41.238
(stuttering): B-bad guy.

04:43.450 --> 04:46.285
- Bad guy? Come on.

04:51.775 --> 04:55.685
I'm clearing out the rest
of Mom's stuff later today.

04:56.130 --> 04:57.629
I'll bring it over, okay?

04:57.781 --> 05:01.091
And you can pick out whatever
you want, how does that sound?

05:02.303 --> 05:04.970
I'll bring over Mom's
rice cooker

05:05.121 --> 05:09.049
and they can cook you gohan
whenever you want it.

05:09.493 --> 05:11.601
Okay? Yeah?

05:13.055 --> 05:16.231
Hey, what happened here?

05:17.759 --> 05:20.527
Did you fall or something?

05:22.064 --> 05:24.031
Then what happened?

05:24.974 --> 05:29.161
(stuttering): Bad guy.

05:30.331 --> 05:32.331
- The guy we just ran into?

05:32.724 --> 05:34.558
(door opening)
- Just checking in

05:34.576 --> 05:37.169
to see how it went.

05:38.730 --> 05:39.487
You okay, Sam?

05:39.673 --> 05:42.065
- Have, have you seen this,
Leon?

05:42.676 --> 05:45.418
You must've noticed this
when you got him dressed.

05:45.512 --> 05:48.722
- I wasn't on shift this
morning, but um,

05:49.833 --> 05:52.100
can I talk to you privately?

05:57.099 --> 05:59.024
- I'll be right back, okay?

06:03.513 --> 06:04.604
What's up?

06:05.532 --> 06:08.349
- I heard Sam
and another resident

06:08.369 --> 06:11.036
got into a pretty heated
argument last night.

06:11.113 --> 06:12.537
Apparently, it got
pretty physical.

06:12.689 --> 06:16.449
- Someone was just harassing
my brother a few minutes ago.

06:16.602 --> 06:18.377
A skinny guy in a red
t-shirt, is that...

06:18.528 --> 06:20.212
is that who gave my brother
those bruises?

06:20.363 --> 06:23.698
- Mr. Tamura, I realize how
upsetting it must be.

06:23.717 --> 06:24.608
- Who is he?

06:24.793 --> 06:26.868
- I'll keep an eye
on the situation.

06:26.945 --> 06:28.220
- What's his name?

06:29.390 --> 06:30.780
- Kyle Tanner.

06:30.799 --> 06:33.967
"Kip." I've seen him get
territorial

06:34.043 --> 06:35.301
when another resident moves in.

06:35.454 --> 06:39.231
I'll keep an eye on the
situation for you, okay?

06:53.580 --> 06:56.248
- Who's gonna live in
Obaachan's house?

06:57.066 --> 06:58.475
- Whoever buys it.

06:58.493 --> 07:00.902
Which is why it has to be empty.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.646
- Do we get to choose
who lives there?

07:02.648 --> 07:05.257
- Uh, not exactly.

07:06.985 --> 07:08.075
- Is that Ojisan's?

07:08.095 --> 07:10.578
- Yeah. Yeah.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.931
You know, he could never learn
to swim like you,

07:13.008 --> 07:14.841
but he always loved the water.

07:14.993 --> 07:16.493
Obaachan got him floaties

07:16.511 --> 07:18.770
so she could bring him in
the pool with her.

07:18.922 --> 07:21.848
Yeah, he's always loved these
even when he got bigger.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.151
- Does he have a pool
at his new home?

07:25.946 --> 07:27.337
- There you are.

07:27.339 --> 07:28.855
Katie and Mallory
are already here.

07:29.007 --> 07:31.950
We need to get changed
into your swimsuit.

07:32.101 --> 07:33.660
- Can I take Sealie?

07:35.514 --> 07:37.363
- Have at it.
(chuckling)

07:37.440 --> 07:40.208
I'll blow it up later, alright?
- Okay.

07:42.111 --> 07:43.587
- Is that everything?

07:44.447 --> 07:45.613
- Yeah.

07:45.632 --> 07:48.467
- Was it hard, being there?

07:49.027 --> 07:52.286
(soft music)

07:53.548 --> 07:56.475
- You know, once I left for
college, I never looked back.

07:57.311 --> 08:01.062
I left her to do everything
for Osamu.

08:02.708 --> 08:08.487
She never went on vacation,
she never even took a day off.

08:09.214 --> 08:10.322
- It made her happy.

08:10.398 --> 08:12.549
She wanted you to
live your life.

08:12.993 --> 08:16.495
- Or maybe she wanted
to spare me the guilt.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.222
- It's a big adjustment.

08:19.224 --> 08:20.314
Just give it a minute.

08:20.392 --> 08:23.168
(phone vibrating)

08:27.323 --> 08:29.899
(chattering)
(whistle blowing)

08:29.901 --> 08:31.084
<i> - Hey, Ashley.</i>

08:31.236 --> 08:32.511
- Sorry to bother you,

08:32.662 --> 08:33.845
I know you're dealing with
family stuff.

08:33.922 --> 08:35.997
- No, that's okay.
What's going on?

08:36.074 --> 08:38.074
- Videla shot off his
mouth at practice.

08:38.076 --> 08:39.351
- Again?

08:39.427 --> 08:41.094
- Except this time someone
caught it on their phone.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.913
And it's blowing up fast.

08:43.932 --> 08:45.565
(sighs)

08:47.010 --> 08:48.509
<i> - You keep tripping</i>
<i> me when I pass.</i>

08:48.587 --> 08:51.071
<i> What are you,</i>
<i> some kind of cripple?</i>

08:52.181 --> 08:53.347
- Well, we need to
get ahead of it.

08:53.367 --> 08:55.700
- Okay. I'll make some calls.

08:57.262 --> 08:58.762
(sighs)
I gotta go in.

08:58.780 --> 09:00.613
Damage control.
- Now?

09:00.690 --> 09:03.708
- You wanna keep them
in private school, right?

09:03.785 --> 09:06.127
- Yes, I do.
- Yes, you do.

09:06.863 --> 09:07.695
So do I.

09:08.106 --> 09:10.774
<i> We're here to address</i>
<i> the leaked video</i>

09:10.776 --> 09:12.292
that's been circulating online.

09:12.386 --> 09:14.553
But let me first
remind everyone

09:14.704 --> 09:17.538
that whatever Videla said
that may have been hurtful

09:17.558 --> 09:20.225
was said in the heat
of an intense team practice.

09:20.260 --> 09:23.210
And before anyone rushes
to judgment,

09:23.230 --> 09:25.730
the team asks that we
all exercise

09:25.882 --> 09:29.234
some cultural sensitivity toward
Videla as a recent immigrant

09:29.311 --> 09:32.386
who's still adjusting
to a new culture

09:32.464 --> 09:35.240
and to his new home here
in America.

09:35.391 --> 09:38.351
But I'll let him express
his regret

09:38.428 --> 09:41.663
in his own words.
So, Videla?

09:43.566 --> 09:45.399
(camera shutters)

09:45.419 --> 09:47.234
- I, um...

09:47.312 --> 09:51.147
want to apologize
to my teammates,

09:51.166 --> 09:53.091
to my family,

09:53.242 --> 09:55.576
and to the disability community

09:55.596 --> 10:00.490
for any pain I may have
inadvertently caused.

10:00.508 --> 10:03.935
- You're a Jedi spin doctor,
playing the immigrant card.

10:04.087 --> 10:05.437
- We'll see.

10:05.513 --> 10:08.607
- Seriously, though,
great job coaching him.

10:08.758 --> 10:10.683
- Except he's still a monster.

10:10.836 --> 10:12.852
(phone chiming)
- With a 20-million dollar foot.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.780
- If I can just keep
it out of his mouth.

10:15.857 --> 10:17.449
Excuse me.

10:21.196 --> 10:22.787
Leon, what's going on?

10:22.939 --> 10:25.272
- I'm in the ER
with your brother.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.533
He fell down some stairs.

10:27.794 --> 10:31.630
The doctor ordered a CT,
but your brother's fine,

10:31.706 --> 10:34.540
<i> they didn't find any bleeding</i>
<i> in his brain.</i>

10:34.617 --> 10:38.119
- But wait, he's never had
a problem navigating stairs.

10:38.196 --> 10:39.954
Did you see him fall?

10:40.031 --> 10:43.032
- No, I... I saw him
right after.

10:43.051 --> 10:45.560
- Did anyone see him?

10:46.721 --> 10:49.356
- Not that I'm aware of.

10:50.466 --> 10:53.693
- So how do you know
he wasn't pushed?

10:54.713 --> 10:56.229
- The State doesn't refute

10:56.381 --> 10:58.564
that the defendant was
protective of his brother.

10:58.659 --> 11:01.976
That's something we can
all respect and admire.

11:02.053 --> 11:06.665
But while we might sympathize
with Mr. Tamura's motivations,

11:06.741 --> 11:09.483
the fact is we're here today

11:09.503 --> 11:13.004
because Mr. Tamura made
a choice.

11:13.156 --> 11:16.007
He acted recklessly.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.509
Dangerously.

11:17.585 --> 11:21.971
And his actions had
consequences.

11:24.576 --> 11:27.477
(theme music)

11:42.351 --> 11:43.368
- Hey.

11:43.595 --> 11:46.687
How you doing? You okay?
(small whimper)

11:46.707 --> 11:49.874
- Other than the four
stitches, he's fine.

11:50.602 --> 11:53.102
- Did you find out anything
more about how this happened?

11:53.121 --> 11:54.270
- I tried asking him,

11:54.363 --> 11:57.006
but we're still learning
how to communicate.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.968
- Buddy. Hey, hey.

12:00.536 --> 12:02.053
Did you fall?

12:04.040 --> 12:05.965
How? Did you trip?

12:06.117 --> 12:08.685
Lose your balance? No? No?

12:12.048 --> 12:13.690
Or did someone push you?

12:22.133 --> 12:23.408
Someone pushed you.

12:23.485 --> 12:26.161
(tense music)

12:27.289 --> 12:29.989
(stuttering): Tablet.

12:29.991 --> 12:32.141
Okasan.

12:32.160 --> 12:33.418
- He was saying that before.

12:33.569 --> 12:35.736
Oka something I mean,
I didn't understand.

12:35.756 --> 12:38.405
- Okasan is Japanese for mother.

12:38.483 --> 12:42.469
You were... you were looking
at pictures? Yeah?

12:48.009 --> 12:49.993
Where's his tablet?

12:50.495 --> 12:52.845
- Oh I... I didn't
know he had one.

12:52.939 --> 12:57.484
Bad guy. Bad guy.

12:59.762 --> 13:00.945
- Kip?

13:01.764 --> 13:03.356
Did Kip take your tablet?

13:03.432 --> 13:08.161
Hey, Sam, Sam,
you need to tell me.

13:09.456 --> 13:14.017
- Kip, we met before, remember?
I'm Sam's brother.

13:14.035 --> 13:15.685
- My room.

13:15.687 --> 13:17.611
- You took his tablet
and I want it back.

13:17.689 --> 13:19.547
Where is it?

13:19.966 --> 13:21.299
- My room.

13:21.450 --> 13:22.467
My stuff.
- You know what?

13:22.544 --> 13:25.804
Just tell me where you put
his tablet.

13:25.880 --> 13:27.363
- My room.

13:27.365 --> 13:28.455
My stuff.

13:28.533 --> 13:30.642
- You don't want
to tell me? Fine.

13:30.793 --> 13:32.552
I'll find it myself.
Hey!

13:32.628 --> 13:34.203
Hey, watch it.

13:34.222 --> 13:36.297
- My room. My stuff.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.482
- Mr. Tamura,

13:37.725 --> 13:40.652
you can't just barge into
another resident's room.

13:40.879 --> 13:42.211
- He took my brother's tablet.

13:42.230 --> 13:44.047
I'm not leavin' until
I get it back.

13:44.566 --> 13:47.233
- Look, I was wrong to barge
in like that

13:47.310 --> 13:48.718
but I didn't know
what else to do.

13:48.720 --> 13:52.580
He took Sam's tablet and pushed
him down those stairs.

13:54.242 --> 13:56.075
- Is that what Sam told you?

13:56.152 --> 13:57.560
- As best he could.

13:57.579 --> 13:58.986
- What did he say?

13:59.005 --> 14:00.338
(sighs)

14:00.415 --> 14:03.174
- Look, obviously his
communication is limited,

14:03.326 --> 14:06.419
but it's pretty clear that guy
Kip is harassing my brother.

14:06.495 --> 14:08.588
- My understanding is that
it was Sam

14:08.664 --> 14:10.515
who instigated the initial
altercation.

14:10.592 --> 14:12.166
- Leon said it was
the other way around.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.801
- I said they had
an altercation.

14:13.836 --> 14:16.762
- You said Kip was territorial
with new residents.

14:16.857 --> 14:18.189
- I also said I wasn't there.

14:18.266 --> 14:20.275
- Why are you defending him?

14:21.252 --> 14:22.919
Who is this guy, Kip?

14:22.921 --> 14:25.938
What's his condition,
and how long has he been here?

14:26.091 --> 14:28.515
- Mr. Tamura, that information
is private

14:28.535 --> 14:29.942
and protected by
HIPAA regulations.

14:30.111 --> 14:33.613
- He's threatening my brother,
physically and emotionally.

14:33.765 --> 14:35.540
What part of that don't you get?

14:36.543 --> 14:39.377
- Mr. Tamura was convinced
that his brother

14:39.454 --> 14:41.862
was being harassed
by another resident.

14:41.940 --> 14:43.364
- Kyle Tanner?

14:43.383 --> 14:44.624
- Yes. "Kip."

14:44.700 --> 14:47.218
- Did the defendant claim
to have witnessed

14:47.295 --> 14:48.961
this alleged harassment?

14:49.055 --> 14:51.130
- No. At least not directly.

14:51.282 --> 14:53.449
- So would you describe
the defendant's behavior

14:53.451 --> 14:55.709
as paranoid?
- Objection, Your Honor.

14:55.787 --> 14:57.711
Improper characterization.
- Sustained.

14:57.731 --> 15:01.399
- Your Honor, the witness holds
a PhD in clinical psychology.

15:01.550 --> 15:03.717
It's her professional
assessment.

15:03.737 --> 15:06.070
(Judge): Still, it's a leading
question.

15:07.098 --> 15:09.032
- Alright, then.

15:16.491 --> 15:20.251
Dr. Weatherford, please confirm
that this is the email you sent

15:20.403 --> 15:22.253
to your company's legal counsel

15:22.330 --> 15:24.905
regarding Mr. Tamura.
- It is.

15:24.983 --> 15:27.541
- Would you please read the
fourth and the fifth sentences.

15:27.652 --> 15:28.676
They're highlighted.

15:29.837 --> 15:32.513
(tense music)

15:34.434 --> 15:37.084
- "From the time Mr. Tamura
brought his brother to live

15:37.162 --> 15:41.088
at Wildwood Gardens, he's been
harboring a paranoid fantasy

15:41.166 --> 15:44.233
that his brother is being abused
by another resident.

15:45.928 --> 15:47.612
I'm bringing this to
your attention now

15:47.689 --> 15:50.189
because I'm concerned
Mr. Tamura's behavior

15:50.266 --> 15:52.450
may turn violent."

15:59.942 --> 16:02.794
- One more question before
you go?

16:02.870 --> 16:05.046
(chattering)

16:10.195 --> 16:13.179
- Hey, Videla, can we talk?

16:15.624 --> 16:16.641
(sighs)

16:16.792 --> 16:18.792
You see those sports writers
over there?

16:18.812 --> 16:21.904
The one in the light grey polo
that's Tom Deitch,

16:21.906 --> 16:24.131
from the Daily.
- Okay. What about him?

16:24.150 --> 16:26.800
- Well, he was about to ambush
you because he had heard

16:26.820 --> 16:29.470
you'd missed your first
sensitivity training session.

16:29.547 --> 16:30.989
(sighs)
Yeah.

16:30.991 --> 16:34.808
I ran interference, told him
you had a last-minute conflict,

16:34.828 --> 16:35.976
but you're still looking
forward

16:36.054 --> 16:37.286
to attending the sessions.

16:37.980 --> 16:39.163
- Okay.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.332
- Okay what?

16:41.409 --> 16:43.668
- Well, what do you want me
to say?

16:43.819 --> 16:45.228
You did your job so I can
do mine.

16:45.246 --> 16:49.415
- Your job also includes
attending sensitivity training.

16:49.567 --> 16:51.492
Especially after you publicly
announced you would.

16:51.569 --> 16:53.160
- Because that's what
you told me to say.

16:53.238 --> 16:56.405
- Videla, listen, you can't
just say you'll do something

16:56.407 --> 16:58.850
and then not do it.
Words matter.

16:59.001 --> 17:01.019
When you make a promise,
people expect you to keep it.

17:01.170 --> 17:02.261
You understand how that...

17:02.413 --> 17:04.597
- Alright, don't talk
to me like a child.

17:04.749 --> 17:06.415
I don't have brain damage.

17:06.417 --> 17:09.176
- Hey! Did you not listen to
anything I just said?

17:09.195 --> 17:10.862
That is derogatory
and offensive,

17:10.938 --> 17:13.923
and don't act like you don't
know what I'm talkin' about.

17:13.925 --> 17:16.034
(♪♪)

17:17.019 --> 17:18.995
(sighing)

17:19.764 --> 17:22.448
Look, I'm sorry. Okay?

17:22.600 --> 17:24.950
This is a sensitive subject--
- Whatever.

17:25.027 --> 17:26.127
- Well I...

17:28.531 --> 17:30.773
(journalist): Videla, hey!
We just have one question.

17:30.775 --> 17:33.626
(journalists clamoring)

17:33.702 --> 17:36.220
- You didn't find anything
I couldn't have found myself.

17:36.297 --> 17:37.704
<i> - I'm sorry you feel that way.</i>

17:37.782 --> 17:39.891
- Why would I pay for
information I could've gotten

17:40.042 --> 17:42.285
off the internet for free?
<i> - We did do what you asked.</i>

17:42.287 --> 17:44.470
- No.
<i> - Yes. Exactly what you asked.</i>

17:44.547 --> 17:45.788
- You know what? You know what?

17:45.807 --> 17:47.548
Just give me back my money
and we'll call it--

17:47.567 --> 17:49.901
<i> - I'm afraid we can't do that.</i>
- What do you mean you can't?

17:49.977 --> 17:51.977
<i> - Well, we did our job, sir.</i>
- Why can't you?

17:52.054 --> 17:53.404
<i> - Read the contract.</i>
(phone beeping)

17:53.631 --> 17:54.739
- Hold on.

17:59.728 --> 18:00.986
Hey, Ashley, what's up?

18:01.081 --> 18:03.564
- Videla's manager is
threatening to file a complaint

18:03.583 --> 18:05.491
with the State Board of Labor
Relations.

18:05.568 --> 18:07.251
- What?
<i> - He says you're creating</i>

18:07.328 --> 18:09.328
a hostile work environment
for his client.

18:09.405 --> 18:10.571
- Oh, for God's sake.

18:10.665 --> 18:13.165
- You berated him in front
of the entire team.

18:13.318 --> 18:15.167
- That is not true.
- No?

18:15.320 --> 18:17.653
<i> - Some of the other players</i>
<i> may have overheard us, but...</i>

18:17.672 --> 18:20.840
Ashley, the guy is a public
relations nightmare.

18:20.916 --> 18:24.160
- Who happens to be carrying
the fate of this entire club

18:24.162 --> 18:25.752
squarely on his shoulders.

18:25.772 --> 18:29.515
- Look, I tried to apologize
but he walked away.

18:29.667 --> 18:32.017
If you want,
I will call him back.

18:32.170 --> 18:33.185
I will make this right.

18:33.338 --> 18:35.262
- It won't do any good, Jiro.

18:35.840 --> 18:36.856
- What are you saying?

18:37.191 --> 18:41.177
- I'm putting you on an
indefinite leave of absence.

18:41.604 --> 18:42.787
- You're not serious.

18:43.030 --> 18:45.123
- Videla says he won't play
if you're on the payroll.

18:45.199 --> 18:46.624
- And you're siding with him?

18:46.701 --> 18:49.852
<i> - Oh come on Jiro,</i>
<i> I'm siding with the team.</i>

18:50.538 --> 18:53.280
But listen, Videla says he will
reconsider if you enroll

18:53.358 --> 18:54.948
in sensitivity training.

18:54.968 --> 18:57.409
- Are you kidding me?

18:57.487 --> 19:00.529
Does he think this is some
kinda joke?

19:00.531 --> 19:02.865
Ashley, the guy is a liar
and bigot

19:02.884 --> 19:04.200
and I'm the one who needs help?

19:04.218 --> 19:06.144
- I don't have a choice,

19:06.220 --> 19:08.062
you understand that, don't you?

19:09.798 --> 19:11.374
<i> - Wait, she fired you?</i>

19:11.467 --> 19:13.542
- Technically,
it's a leave of absence.

19:13.561 --> 19:16.154
- Does she have any idea what
you've been dealing with?

19:16.230 --> 19:17.846
- She doesn't care about
my brother any more

19:17.848 --> 19:19.565
than those people
at Wildwood Gardens.

19:19.642 --> 19:22.493
- Oh Jiro, I'm sorry,
but you have to let that go.

19:22.570 --> 19:24.311
Okay? They said they were doing
everything they could

19:24.330 --> 19:25.554
to monitor the situation.

19:25.723 --> 19:27.981
That's their job.
- Well maybe I don't trust them.

19:28.075 --> 19:30.576
- What, you think they're lying
to you? Why?

19:30.728 --> 19:31.577
Why would they do that?

19:31.729 --> 19:34.488
- To protect themselves.

19:34.507 --> 19:35.590
Liability.

19:38.327 --> 19:40.344
I've been trying to find out if
this guy Kip

19:40.496 --> 19:42.162
has any kind of a
criminal record.

19:42.240 --> 19:44.849
And I just...
I just wasted $5,000

19:45.000 --> 19:48.093
on a dead-end pointless
record search.

19:48.170 --> 19:51.414
- Well, if nothing came up,
maybe that's your answer.

19:51.416 --> 19:54.083
- Not if the records are sealed.

19:54.101 --> 19:56.694
Which they would be under
California law, right?

19:57.363 --> 19:58.529
- Yeah.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.350
- I've been thinking

20:04.353 --> 20:07.780
you have clearance from
the DA's office.

20:07.856 --> 20:10.666
Maybe you could look for me?
- Jiro, I can't do that.

20:11.377 --> 20:12.526
- Why not?

20:12.545 --> 20:14.194
- Well, for one thing,
the State monitors

20:14.214 --> 20:16.029
everyone who accesses
that database.

20:16.123 --> 20:17.381
- It's not like
you'd be hacking in.

20:17.533 --> 20:19.108
You're allowed to log on
whenever you want.

20:19.126 --> 20:21.177
- Not for something like this.

20:22.447 --> 20:26.057
- Sarah, if the guy has
a history of violence,

20:26.133 --> 20:27.783
we can't risk keeping Sam there.

20:27.785 --> 20:29.727
- We looked at five different
facilities,

20:29.804 --> 20:32.897
your mom chose Wildwood, because
it was the closest to us, right?

20:32.974 --> 20:35.291
- If you'll just look, we can
make an informed decision.

20:35.309 --> 20:36.792
Why won't you do this for me?

20:36.811 --> 20:38.885
- Because it's an
ethical violation.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.387
- Really?

20:40.465 --> 20:42.147
Or are you worried
you'll find something.

20:42.300 --> 20:43.299
- Excuse me?

20:43.301 --> 20:44.650
- Maybe you'd rather
not know, huh?

20:44.727 --> 20:46.244
Not your problem, right?

20:46.320 --> 20:48.304
- Seriously? You did
not just say that.

20:48.306 --> 20:50.473
- Well, Sarah, you know what?
I'm just having a hard time

20:50.491 --> 20:53.292
understanding why you're not
helping me.

20:54.829 --> 20:56.645
Oh, god.

20:56.647 --> 20:58.572
- Hi honey, why aren't
you sleeping?

20:58.649 --> 20:59.982
- You woke me up.

21:00.001 --> 21:01.425
- I'm sorry.

21:02.320 --> 21:04.637
I'll take you back
to bed, okay?

21:05.490 --> 21:06.338
Come on.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.491
- Why were you guys
were yelling?

21:08.493 --> 21:10.159
(sighs)

21:10.177 --> 21:11.602
- I was angry.

21:11.754 --> 21:13.178
Yes. Of course I was.

21:13.331 --> 21:15.564
But not paranoid.

21:17.092 --> 21:18.276
I'd seen the bruises.

21:18.427 --> 21:21.670
Okay? I... I saw the look
in my brother's eyes.

21:21.689 --> 21:25.283
I knew in my gut someone
was hurting him,

21:26.193 --> 21:28.327
and no one seemed to care.

21:34.460 --> 21:37.295
(angsty music)

22:15.076 --> 22:16.584
- What are you doing?

22:17.986 --> 22:19.295
Jiro?

22:20.247 --> 22:22.340
Are you serious?
- Okay, look...

22:22.491 --> 22:24.083
- I said no!

22:24.235 --> 22:25.751
Okay. I was very clear.

22:25.828 --> 22:27.086
Do you want to get me
disbarred?

22:27.238 --> 22:28.571
Do you want us both
out of a job?

22:28.573 --> 22:31.256
- Wow, thanks.
Really supportive.

22:31.333 --> 22:32.833
- I've been trying to be
supportive!

22:32.852 --> 22:35.519
That is all I'm trying to do!
Because I know you're grieving.

22:35.596 --> 22:37.746
But honestly,
this isn't healthy.

22:37.765 --> 22:40.340
This isn't you.
This... fixation, this rage,

22:40.418 --> 22:41.525
the way you're flying off
the handle.

22:41.677 --> 22:45.804
- Yeah, God forbid, right?
For once in my life.

22:45.882 --> 22:46.847
- What does that even mean?

22:47.108 --> 22:49.867
- Maybe for once I'm not
making everybody happy.

22:50.094 --> 22:52.036
Everybody else.

22:55.132 --> 22:57.291
(sighs)

23:01.772 --> 23:04.715
Look, you're right, okay?

23:06.293 --> 23:08.260
I shouldn't have done that.

23:09.037 --> 23:10.679
I'm sorry.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.015
I am.

23:14.952 --> 23:16.477
But...

23:18.380 --> 23:21.140
...what if he's dangerous?

23:21.884 --> 23:25.152
And what if they are
hiding something?

23:27.389 --> 23:29.907
I made a promise to my mother

23:30.058 --> 23:33.494
that Sam would be okay after
she was gone.

23:34.639 --> 23:37.081
He's not okay, Sarah.

23:38.643 --> 23:40.042
I can't...

23:40.661 --> 23:41.994
I can't just...

23:42.146 --> 23:44.505
(shuddering breath)

23:46.500 --> 23:47.833
- Okay.

23:49.003 --> 23:55.491
If we do this and there's
nothing, will that help you?

23:55.935 --> 23:57.676
Will you let this go?

23:57.828 --> 23:59.252
- Yes.

24:00.331 --> 24:06.694
- And will you talk to someone?
A therapist? A grief counsellor?

24:07.429 --> 24:08.112
- Okay.

24:08.263 --> 24:09.697
- Do you promise?

24:10.766 --> 24:12.158
- Yeah.

24:13.360 --> 24:15.161
- Okay.

24:20.034 --> 24:23.018
No, I'll do it.
Can you just stand over there?

24:23.020 --> 24:24.295
(chuckling)

24:24.371 --> 24:25.779
- Does it really make
a difference?

24:25.798 --> 24:27.280
- Can you just...
- Okay.

24:27.358 --> 24:29.216
- Please? Thank you.

24:34.623 --> 24:36.390
Kip Tanner, right?

24:37.143 --> 24:39.718
- His legal name is Kyle.

24:40.221 --> 24:42.146
(sighs)
Kyle Tanner.

24:42.798 --> 24:46.192
- I just need to run this
through an encryption program.

24:52.066 --> 24:53.532
- Thank you.

25:01.075 --> 25:03.042
What if this is me?

25:04.337 --> 25:05.961
All this...

25:06.747 --> 25:08.297
...anger.

25:10.067 --> 25:11.258
I don't know.

25:12.086 --> 25:14.136
It doesn't make sense.

25:15.497 --> 25:17.014
- Maybe it does.

25:18.592 --> 25:20.684
Like you said, you spent
your whole life

25:20.761 --> 25:22.594
trying to make
everyone happy.

25:23.430 --> 25:26.023
Being the one that nobody
worried about

25:27.009 --> 25:28.609
because you had to.

25:29.195 --> 25:31.028
You had no choice.

25:32.865 --> 25:35.348
- I don't have a right
to complain.

25:36.460 --> 25:38.260
If the car had been hit
from the other side,

25:38.262 --> 25:40.037
it would've been me.

25:41.448 --> 25:44.625
I walked away with
two broken ribs.

25:45.711 --> 25:47.711
- You paid a price too.

25:52.459 --> 25:53.676
Oh, my god.

25:54.962 --> 25:56.779
- What? What is it?

25:57.205 --> 25:58.947
- He does have a record.

25:58.966 --> 26:00.224
- For what?

26:00.301 --> 26:02.226
- He was arrested three times.

26:02.303 --> 26:04.544
The last one was two years ago,

26:04.564 --> 26:07.139
he was charged with aggravated
assault.

26:08.216 --> 26:12.236
Instead of prison,
he spent part of his term

26:12.313 --> 26:14.721
in a state psychiatric hospital.

26:15.408 --> 26:17.575
Until his sentence was commuted

26:17.726 --> 26:22.037
and he was transferred
to Wildwood Gardens.

26:23.231 --> 26:25.207
- He is dangerous.

26:33.408 --> 26:35.241
- After your call last night,
I authorized Leon

26:35.319 --> 26:37.636
to search Kip's room

26:38.931 --> 26:40.681
and he found this.

26:42.827 --> 26:44.509
Of course, it doesn't
prove anything

26:44.586 --> 26:47.420
other than that he stole
your brother's tablet.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.422
- So you're not doing anything.

26:49.500 --> 26:51.834
- Mr. Tamura--
- My brother's body is bruised.

26:51.852 --> 26:53.335
We can't--
- Kyle Tanner

26:53.337 --> 26:55.520
has been transferred
to another facility.

26:55.597 --> 26:59.099
The property theft was a
violation of his probation.

26:59.118 --> 27:00.284
- So he's gone.

27:00.361 --> 27:02.411
- As of this morning.

27:03.347 --> 27:05.347
I apologize that this happened

27:05.366 --> 27:08.959
and if you want, I can launch
a full investigation.

27:09.036 --> 27:10.461
- No.

27:11.113 --> 27:12.855
That's not necessary.

27:13.524 --> 27:16.216
As long as he's away
from my brother.

27:17.544 --> 27:20.095
(excited chatter)

27:23.033 --> 27:24.558
- Hey.

27:26.704 --> 27:28.929
Leon found it in Kip's room.

27:29.815 --> 27:33.876
Hey, he won't bother
you anymore.

27:33.878 --> 27:36.195
I promise, okay?

27:37.398 --> 27:40.382
You wanna look at some pictures,
together?

27:40.384 --> 27:41.492
Come on.

27:43.570 --> 27:46.997
(soft music)

28:00.328 --> 28:03.238
I have your Sealie floatie
in the garage.

28:03.590 --> 28:06.684
You can come over to the house
whenever you want to swim.

28:08.595 --> 28:09.853
(chuckles)

28:10.080 --> 28:13.023
(♪♪)

28:17.771 --> 28:19.254
- Okasan.

28:19.757 --> 28:21.657
- You miss her, don't you?

28:24.595 --> 28:25.744
Me too.

28:28.115 --> 28:29.932
(stuttering): Bento.

28:29.950 --> 28:31.524
(laughing)

28:31.602 --> 28:34.461
- She made the best
bento, right?

28:36.215 --> 28:39.758
- Tamagoyaki.
- That was my favorite too.

28:40.945 --> 28:43.679
(♪♪)

28:59.221 --> 29:01.238
- Hey, how was the swim?

29:01.389 --> 29:02.614
- Awesome.

29:03.484 --> 29:04.557
What are you doing?

29:04.635 --> 29:07.745
- I'm making a bento
box for Ojisan.

29:09.473 --> 29:10.472
- I can help.

29:10.474 --> 29:11.582
- I'd love that.

29:11.733 --> 29:13.475
Layla, what about you?

29:13.568 --> 29:15.085
- Homework.

29:16.905 --> 29:17.996
- Tamagoyaki?

29:18.573 --> 29:20.758
- Yeah, Obaachan's
special recipe.

29:20.834 --> 29:23.927
Sugar, mirin, soy sauce,
a pinch of salt.

29:24.004 --> 29:26.930
But this is the secret.

29:27.157 --> 29:28.824
- "HonDashi."
- HonDashi.

29:28.842 --> 29:30.842
That's what gives it that umami.

29:30.995 --> 29:32.327
One teaspoon.

29:32.772 --> 29:36.331
- How come you never taught us
how to make Obaachan's recipe?

29:36.333 --> 29:37.757
- He's teaching you now.

29:37.777 --> 29:40.352
But let's get you out of the
wet bathing suit first, okay?

29:40.504 --> 29:41.261
- Okay.

29:41.338 --> 29:42.946
- Ashley's on the phone.

29:43.023 --> 29:44.840
I just, I didn't want
you to miss it.

29:44.858 --> 29:46.158
- Yeah. Okay.

29:49.955 --> 29:51.663
- Yeah, yeah.

29:52.774 --> 29:54.792
Ashley?
<i> (man): Hold please.</i>

29:55.686 --> 29:57.920
<i> (Ashley): How're you doing,</i>
<i> Jiro?</i>

29:58.689 --> 30:00.705
- Uh, good. Thank you.

30:00.782 --> 30:01.706
The situation

30:02.042 --> 30:04.709
<i>with my brother's been resolved,</i>
<i> so I'm...</i>

30:04.862 --> 30:06.786
(sighs)
I'm much better.

30:06.806 --> 30:08.138
(whispering): The sensitivity.

30:08.699 --> 30:12.142
- Uh, I even signed up for
sensitivity training.

30:12.294 --> 30:14.144
- So you're ready to
come back to work.

30:14.221 --> 30:15.646
- Yes.

30:15.797 --> 30:18.707
- Good. Because I think Videla
is open to hearing from you.

30:18.709 --> 30:21.985
- That's great. I'll call him
as soon as we hang up.

30:22.062 --> 30:23.803
- Better to do it in person.

30:23.881 --> 30:25.730
The team's leaving for some
exhibition games tomorrow,

30:25.807 --> 30:27.140
you can talk to him on
the plane.

30:27.159 --> 30:30.476
- Uh, what time?
<i> - Wheels up at 7:30.</i>

30:30.496 --> 30:33.646
I'll let him know beforehand
so he's not blindsided.

30:34.241 --> 30:37.042
- Thank you, Ashley.
<i> - See you tomorrow.</i>

30:38.003 --> 30:39.895
- That's good news.

30:39.897 --> 30:41.063
(Jiro sighs)

30:41.065 --> 30:42.339
What's wrong?

30:42.675 --> 30:43.732
- I...

30:43.825 --> 30:46.159
promised Sam I'd drop
off that bento.

30:46.236 --> 30:48.679
- I'll do it.
I'll take the girls.

30:49.497 --> 30:54.576
Hey, your brother will be here
when you get back, okay?

30:54.595 --> 30:57.378
But your job might not be
if you don't go.

30:57.414 --> 30:59.064
- Mm.

31:06.681 --> 31:07.923
- Hi, good morning.

31:08.200 --> 31:12.444
Um, I'm dropping this off for
my brother Osamu Tamura, Sam.

31:12.596 --> 31:14.779
- Um, visiting hours start
at seven o'clock,

31:14.932 --> 31:16.765
but if you leave it here I'll
have someone bring it to him.

31:16.783 --> 31:20.285
- It's perishable, so I'd like
to put it in his fridge

31:20.437 --> 31:21.378
if that's okay.

31:21.529 --> 31:24.256
- Visiting hours start
at seven o'clock.

31:25.700 --> 31:28.627
- That's in 20 minutes,
and I have a flight to catch.

31:28.703 --> 31:33.181
Look, my brother is an early
riser, I won't be waking him.

31:35.895 --> 31:37.802
- Just please sign in.

31:38.288 --> 31:40.063
- I appreciate it.

31:42.568 --> 31:45.277
(eerie music)

31:56.990 --> 31:58.248
- Sam?

32:04.423 --> 32:04.996
Sam?

32:05.090 --> 32:07.090
(whimpering)

32:08.594 --> 32:10.335
What the hell.

32:10.487 --> 32:11.970
Sam? Hey.

32:12.580 --> 32:13.488
Oh, no.

32:13.507 --> 32:15.340
Oh, no.
(whimpering continues)

32:15.492 --> 32:17.476
I gotcha, bud.
It's okay.

32:18.512 --> 32:20.420
Hey, hey, hey.
It's gonna be okay.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.347
I'm here. We're gonna get
you outta here okay?

32:22.424 --> 32:25.108
Can you sit up?
I need you to sit up.

32:25.260 --> 32:27.018
Sit up.
I need you to sit up.

32:27.095 --> 32:29.613
(grunting)

32:38.682 --> 32:40.365
I got you. It's okay.

32:40.517 --> 32:42.793
Ready? We're gonna get up.

32:42.869 --> 32:44.461
- Bad guy.

32:44.538 --> 32:45.854
- Whatever your thinking
is wrong.

32:45.856 --> 32:47.856
- I don't want to hear it!
Move out of the way.

32:47.858 --> 32:50.709
- You can't take him off site--
- Don't ever touch me!

32:50.785 --> 32:54.513
(screaming)
We trusted you!

32:56.976 --> 33:02.229
- Jiro, Jiro, Jiro, Jiro!

33:03.298 --> 33:06.650
Hey, hey. Shh. Shh.

33:06.727 --> 33:07.818
Come on.

33:07.969 --> 33:10.153
Come on.
(whimpering)

33:10.230 --> 33:11.363
Come on, come on.

33:17.904 --> 33:20.555
- You sent Leon to
the emergency room.

33:21.058 --> 33:25.076
With an orbital fracture
and a severe concussion.

33:25.820 --> 33:29.655
You left him unconscious,
bleeding out on the floor.

33:29.657 --> 33:31.399
- He was abusing my brother.

33:31.418 --> 33:32.509
- So you say.

33:32.660 --> 33:35.403
Was that allegation
ever substantiated?

33:35.405 --> 33:37.347
- I was there.
I saw it.

33:37.499 --> 33:38.998
- So why not call out for help?

33:39.018 --> 33:40.183
Reach out to the senior staff
on site?

33:40.260 --> 33:42.168
- Because I didn't trust them.

33:42.187 --> 33:43.687
- What about the police?

33:43.764 --> 33:46.356
- I... I just,
I needed to get him out.

33:46.433 --> 33:48.433
That was all I could
think about.

33:48.861 --> 33:51.028
- Because you thought
he'd be safer...

33:51.104 --> 33:52.612
with you.

33:53.014 --> 33:54.531
- Yes.

33:55.150 --> 33:56.616
- And was he?

34:02.949 --> 34:04.766
(whimpering)
- Hey.

34:04.785 --> 34:08.194
- I know it's cold, but it'll
help with the swelling.

34:08.213 --> 34:10.863
Hold it on your eye, okay?

34:10.941 --> 34:13.458
(stuttering): Cold.

34:13.535 --> 34:15.093
- I know.

34:16.947 --> 34:19.056
(phone vibrating)

34:20.875 --> 34:21.966
- Oh, Ashley.

34:22.043 --> 34:24.061
- You haven't told her
you're not going?

34:24.212 --> 34:26.879
You were supposed to be on
the plane 15 minutes ago.

34:26.899 --> 34:28.306
- I know, I know.

34:28.383 --> 34:29.641
<i> - Where the hell are you?</i>

34:29.717 --> 34:32.644
- Ashley? I'm sorry,
I should've called before.

34:32.796 --> 34:33.886
<i> - We're about to take off.</i>

34:33.906 --> 34:35.054
<i> I thought your family</i>
<i> crap was resolved.</i>

34:35.074 --> 34:36.798
- I know. I know. I thought

34:36.817 --> 34:38.149
it was over too but it wasn't.

34:38.226 --> 34:39.984
<i> - You said you would...</i>
- What happened to Ojisan?

34:40.061 --> 34:42.153
- He got hurt, honey,
but he's gonna be okay.

34:42.306 --> 34:44.081
- Is that why the
police are here?

34:44.232 --> 34:46.474
(Ashley talking on the phone)
- There are cops outside.

34:46.476 --> 34:47.751
What's going on?
(doorbell ringing)

34:47.828 --> 34:50.736
- Ashley, I'm sorry,
but I really gotta jump, okay?

34:51.406 --> 34:53.331
- Okay, girls, I'm gonna go talk
to the police.

34:53.408 --> 34:55.667
Can you stay with Ojisan?
- Okay.

34:55.743 --> 34:58.095
- Yeah, I know. Ashley, I know,

34:58.246 --> 35:01.264
you put yourself on the line
for me and I'm grateful but...

35:01.416 --> 35:03.158
Look, I really have to go.
I'm sorry.

35:03.176 --> 35:05.477
(sighs)
- What do they want?

35:10.500 --> 35:11.424
- Mr. Tamura?

35:11.443 --> 35:12.684
- Yes.

35:12.853 --> 35:15.170
- We're responding to a call
about an alleged assault

35:15.188 --> 35:16.171
and abduction.

35:16.764 --> 35:19.858
- If anyone's been assaulted,
it's my brother.

35:20.010 --> 35:21.618
- Osamu.
- Yeah.

35:21.695 --> 35:24.179
- Right. Is he here?
'Cause we'd like to talk to him.

35:24.623 --> 35:28.542
- He can't communicate very
well, his speech is limited.

35:30.129 --> 35:31.444
Why don't we sort this
out at the precinct?

35:31.463 --> 35:33.521
- Officer--
- There's nothing to 'sort.'

35:33.523 --> 35:35.281
Okay? Whatever they told you
is crap.

35:35.300 --> 35:36.782
They're just trying
to cover their asses.

35:36.802 --> 35:39.952
- Jiro. Officer, I'm his wife
and I'm also an attorney.

35:39.972 --> 35:41.454
- We're the victims here.

35:41.473 --> 35:43.789
- Maybe we can come in
and talk about it.

35:43.809 --> 35:45.216
- Not unless you have a warrant.

35:45.293 --> 35:46.626
Which I'm guessing you
don't have,

35:46.703 --> 35:48.311
otherwise you wouldn't
be asking.

35:48.463 --> 35:52.107
- Daddy! Daddy!
Ojisan's in the pool.

35:53.801 --> 35:54.818
- Sam!

35:54.969 --> 35:57.379
(stressful music)
Sam!

35:57.397 --> 35:59.214
Sam. Sam.

35:59.307 --> 36:00.882
(Officer): Flip him over.
Flip him over!

36:00.884 --> 36:02.576
Bring him in.

36:03.996 --> 36:05.311
Up. Up!

36:05.389 --> 36:06.738
(grunting)
- Got him.

36:06.890 --> 36:08.147
(Sunny): Ojisan!

36:08.225 --> 36:11.293
- Girls, come inside.
Come inside.

36:12.004 --> 36:14.171
- He's not breathing.

36:15.065 --> 36:16.173
No pulse.

36:16.324 --> 36:17.565
(Officer): Request an ambulance.

36:17.567 --> 36:20.735
18 Teakwood Lane.
We got a 10-32.

36:20.754 --> 36:23.905
(crying): He saw Sealie,
but there wasn't any air!

36:23.907 --> 36:25.924
I said I'd get the pump,
but he fell in.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.184
- It's okay. Shh.

36:27.335 --> 36:29.186
(Layla): I'm so sorry.
I shouldn't have left them.

36:29.337 --> 36:31.246
It's my fault.
- It's not your fault, honey.

36:31.264 --> 36:32.096
It was an accident.

36:32.249 --> 36:33.581
(sobbing)

36:33.600 --> 36:36.008
<i> (radio): Dispatch, EMS will be</i>
<i> there in five minutes.</i>

36:36.086 --> 36:36.610
(Officer): Copy.

36:40.532 --> 36:43.533
- California law defines
criminal negligence

36:43.610 --> 36:49.097
as "a gross deviation from a
reasonable standard of care."

36:49.115 --> 36:51.399
That standard
is especially

36:51.435 --> 36:53.543
high when it comes
to dependent adults,

36:53.620 --> 36:55.861
as I'm sure you're aware?

36:55.881 --> 36:57.029
- I am, yes.

36:57.049 --> 36:58.440
- And just to be clear:

36:59.534 --> 37:03.278
you forcibly removed
your brother from the facility

37:03.280 --> 37:05.722
legally entrusted with his care,

37:05.873 --> 37:07.966
transported him to your home

37:08.118 --> 37:11.286
where you have an unfenced
backyard pool,

37:11.288 --> 37:13.121
and left him unsupervised,

37:13.123 --> 37:16.215
knowing full well
he couldn't swim

37:16.235 --> 37:19.569
and would easily drown
if he fell in.

37:22.056 --> 37:25.617
- Well, thankfully he didn't.

37:29.489 --> 37:30.997
- Yes.

37:31.825 --> 37:33.141
Thankfully.

37:33.810 --> 37:36.661
But he very well could have.

37:37.314 --> 37:39.238
Because of your negligence.

37:39.316 --> 37:42.650
Because your so-called attempt
to save him

37:42.669 --> 37:44.094
nearly ended his life.

37:44.096 --> 37:46.154
- Objection, Your Honor.

37:46.156 --> 37:47.580
Argumentative.

37:47.657 --> 37:49.182
- Sustained.

37:52.253 --> 37:53.728
- That's all I've got.

37:54.514 --> 37:55.830
- Any redirect, Mr. Black?

37:55.923 --> 37:58.924
- Uh, Your Honor, I'd like
a brief recess to confer.

37:58.944 --> 38:00.426
- Fifteen minutes?

38:00.445 --> 38:02.028
- Yes, Your Honor.

38:03.097 --> 38:05.949
(chattering)

38:06.026 --> 38:07.433
- I've been reading that jury.

38:07.511 --> 38:08.860
The way they're looking at him.

38:09.012 --> 38:12.289
I have a bad feeling this is
going in the wrong direction

38:12.365 --> 38:14.291
but tell me if you think
I'm wrong.

38:15.535 --> 38:18.520
We need to go back to the DA and
tell him we're taking the plea.

38:18.522 --> 38:20.188
- I can see if it's still
on the table.

38:20.190 --> 38:21.497
- I'm here, you know.

38:21.724 --> 38:23.967
- I'm sorry, but we have
to be realistic.

38:24.118 --> 38:25.951
Okay? You have a choice in this.

38:26.029 --> 38:29.364
- I'm not pleading guilty.
I can't.

38:29.382 --> 38:30.623
- Jiro.

38:30.700 --> 38:31.957
You may lose this.

38:32.035 --> 38:33.217
- I know.

38:33.294 --> 38:34.719
- Which means you could
go to prison.

38:34.796 --> 38:37.022
- I know, Sarah. I know!

38:39.559 --> 38:41.192
- And what about me?

38:42.988 --> 38:44.804
What about the girls?

38:44.823 --> 38:46.639
The damage you could do to them.

38:46.716 --> 38:48.992
This is your life.

38:49.553 --> 38:50.902
Your family.

38:51.404 --> 38:54.539
Are you really willing
to take that risk?

38:56.150 --> 38:58.001
<i> - Mr. Tamura,</i>

38:58.152 --> 39:01.046
I have only one last question.

39:02.399 --> 39:04.174
You have been repeatedly
offered

39:04.250 --> 39:05.825
a plea bargain in this case.

39:05.902 --> 39:09.179
One that would allow you to
avoid prison time altogether?

39:09.664 --> 39:12.849
- Yes. You've advised me
to accept it.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.726
- Why won't you?

39:18.005 --> 39:20.264
- Because accepting the plea

39:20.417 --> 39:23.101
would disqualify me from
applying to become

39:23.253 --> 39:25.028
my brother's legal guardian.

39:27.774 --> 39:30.658
Which is what I should have
done after our mother died.

39:31.686 --> 39:33.519
And for that I'm...

39:33.597 --> 39:35.747
I'm truly sorry.

39:40.286 --> 39:44.363
Look honestly,
I'd always felt ashamed.

39:45.458 --> 39:49.444
Letting my mother care for
Osamu his whole life

39:50.130 --> 39:53.598
it's something I imagined could
only be a burden.

39:56.136 --> 39:59.229
When she died, my wife and I
told ourselves

39:59.380 --> 40:02.882
he'd be better served
with professionals.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.567
People with expertise.

40:04.719 --> 40:07.612
But the truth is we were scared.

40:09.408 --> 40:13.743
Of what it might mean to
care for him ourselves.

40:15.639 --> 40:19.249
Between our careers and raising
our daughters,

40:19.400 --> 40:21.901
I thought it was too much.

40:21.978 --> 40:23.962
That it would spread
us too thin.

40:26.816 --> 40:29.909
But if I've learned anything
from this experience,

40:29.928 --> 40:33.054
it's that my basic assumption
was wrong.

40:34.933 --> 40:38.935
Caring for my brother won't
subtract from how

40:39.012 --> 40:41.754
we parent our children,
or do our jobs.

40:41.831 --> 40:46.276
If anything, bringing Osamu
into our home

40:46.427 --> 40:48.570
will make us better parents.

40:50.190 --> 40:52.340
And me a better husband.

40:52.358 --> 40:55.285
And I can't get past
the idea that I might...

40:55.436 --> 40:57.662
(shaky breath)

41:00.775 --> 41:03.001
I might not get that chance.

41:04.688 --> 41:07.505
(emotional music)

41:08.967 --> 41:11.116
I've made mistakes, okay?

41:11.136 --> 41:13.511
And for those I am sorry.

41:14.973 --> 41:19.476
But I can't plead guilty if it
means they won't let me bring

41:19.627 --> 41:22.020
my brother home.

41:23.148 --> 41:25.690
(sobbing quietly)

41:30.489 --> 41:32.396
I'm begging you.

41:32.549 --> 41:33.990
Please.

41:38.145 --> 41:40.205
Let me do it right this time.

41:45.562 --> 41:48.004
(sniffing)

41:51.751 --> 41:54.159
<i> - Come on, Ojisan!</i>

41:55.238 --> 41:56.921
(Sunny): You can do this.
We're right here.

41:57.349 --> 41:58.497
Come on, Ojisan.

41:58.558 --> 42:01.500
(Layla): You can do it.
We're right here.

42:01.520 --> 42:03.594
We'll catch you. We promise!
- We'll catch you!

42:04.171 --> 42:06.080
(Layla): The water's just right.

42:06.173 --> 42:08.416
(Sunny): Come on, Ojisan!
Come on!

42:08.434 --> 42:10.175
- You got this.
- Come on.

42:10.253 --> 42:11.419
We're waiting for you!

42:11.421 --> 42:12.511
- Hey.

42:12.531 --> 42:14.179
Hey. It's okay, Sam.

42:14.257 --> 42:15.606
If you don't want to go in now,

42:15.683 --> 42:17.516
we can always try again
tomorrow, okay?

42:17.536 --> 42:19.777
(exhaling)

42:19.929 --> 42:22.021
(♪♪)

42:22.599 --> 42:25.041
(Sunny): You can do it.
We're right here.

42:25.544 --> 42:29.128
(both): 1, 2, 3!

42:30.048 --> 42:32.698
(cheering)

42:33.552 --> 42:35.943
(Sunny): I knew you could do it!
(Sarah): Way to go, Sam!

42:35.945 --> 42:37.202
- Alright, Sam!

42:37.371 --> 42:39.872
(Sunny): See? It wasn't so hard.
(Jiro): Way to go, buddy.

42:39.949 --> 42:41.266
(laughing)

42:42.227 --> 42:43.518
Nice.

42:44.470 --> 42:47.188
(laughing)

42:56.724 --> 43:01.035
Subtitling: difuze
