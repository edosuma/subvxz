Hey.

11:52.546 --> 11:55.132
Hi.

11:55.173 --> 11:57.926
You were right.

11:57.968 --> 11:59.928
Oh.

today would be the day?

12:03.181 --> 12:04.975
(EXHALES)

12:05.016 --> 12:06.726
Just had a feeling.

12:06.768 --> 12:09.563
I don't understand
what those numbers mean.

12:09.604 --> 12:11.815
You're not supposed to.

12:11.857 --> 12:15.026
And, frankly,
it's better if you don't.

12:15.068 --> 12:18.488
Is my pops doing
something wrong?

12:21.241 --> 12:23.493
He's just doing what he's told.

12:24.703 --> 12:26.621
I know he's a sneaky fuck.

12:26.663 --> 12:29.541
It's not about him.

12:29.583 --> 12:32.127
And stop asking me about it.

Stop worrying about me.

12:42.929 --> 12:47.100
I'm the one who's supposed
to be worried about you.

12:47.142 --> 12:48.977
I promised your mother.

12:51.229 --> 12:54.065

Your front door was unlocked,
so, I, um...

15:24.758 --> 15:26.718
I broke into your house.
(CHUCKLING): Sorry.

15:26.760 --> 15:27.802
Okay, no, that's fine.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.804
I'm just... I'm...
I was surprised.

15:34.851 --> 15:36.061
Can we talk?

Sure.

of your...

over in your racks.

16:19.270 --> 16:21.189
Do you not know
what this past year

16:21.231 --> 16:22.691
has been like for some of us?

16:22.732 --> 16:24.776
Yes, I... I understand.

16:24.818 --> 16:27.028
Do you? 'Cause I don't think
you understand what

16:27.070 --> 16:28.405
your brother has done to me.

16:28.446 --> 16:31.157
Uh... I...
I don't, I don't know, Gene.

16:31.199 --> 16:33.785
- Maybe I don't understand.
- No, you don't.

16:34.828 --> 16:37.163
I'm sorry.

16:54.264 --> 16:58.226
I know that nothing will ever
compensate for your loss.

17:01.271 --> 17:05.525

17:05.567 --> 17:08.819
you're pursuing, I get it.

17:08.862 --> 17:11.948
But all your grief...

17:13.700 --> 17:16.411
...all your pain...

17:17.871 --> 17:22.291
...will be diffused
into a faceless crowd.

17:23.292 --> 17:25.627
They just want the money.

17:25.670 --> 17:29.424
That's what it's about
for them, money.

17:29.466 --> 17:31.426
And they'll get a few bucks.

17:31.468 --> 17:32.927
And you'll get a few bucks,

17:32.969 --> 17:36.514
and your lawyers
will get the most bucks of all.

17:36.556 --> 17:40.852

17:40.894 --> 17:43.354
when they have
finished up, packed up,

still be sitting here.

to move forward with your life.

Could I have
your attention, please?

First of all,
we'd like to thank you guys

19:01.641 --> 19:03.184
for coming tonight.

19:03.226 --> 19:05.687
Um, my name's Billy McBride.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.146
This is my associate,

19:07.188 --> 19:09.190
- Patty Solis-Papagian.
- Hi.

19:09.232 --> 19:11.192
This is Brittany Gold.

19:11.234 --> 19:13.319
Marva Jefferson.
Part of our team.

19:14.571 --> 19:16.698
We're attorneys,
and we're organizing

19:16.739 --> 19:18.783
the class action
for the citizens

of Blackwood County
who don't have any water.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.789
when is our water coming back?

19:24.831 --> 19:26.916
Well, we don't have
that answer yet, sir.

19:26.958 --> 19:28.293
- You don't know?
- Uh, not yet.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.044
It's kind of early
in the process.

19:30.086 --> 19:33.047
But, uh, let me explain to you
what's happening, okay?

19:33.089 --> 19:37.135
The Blackwood County Water Board
controls your water, right?

19:37.176 --> 19:39.804
Well, during this drought,
they've decided

19:39.846 --> 19:41.890
to give all your water
to the farmers,

19:41.931 --> 19:43.808
so they can keep
their businesses open.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.810
- (ANGRY CHATTER)
- This is bullshit.

19:45.852 --> 19:49.022
That's what the class action
is all about.

19:49.063 --> 19:52.191
But, uh, we're very hopeful
that, uh, we can win this thing

19:52.233 --> 19:54.694
and, uh, get your water back
as soon as possible.

19:54.736 --> 19:57.822
Um, water's great,
but I'm a hundred grand in debt.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.824
I-I'm putting in a new well,

19:59.866 --> 20:01.868
I'm upside down
on my house, and...

20:01.910 --> 20:03.953
I think my wife's
leaving me, so...

20:03.995 --> 20:05.830
I'm sorry to hear that.

I understand, sir.
I-I know it's tough.

20:08.666 --> 20:11.210
But like I said, we're hopeful
that we could get you guys

20:11.252 --> 20:14.088
a really good settlement,
possibly in the millions, so...

20:14.130 --> 20:15.256
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

20:15.298 --> 20:16.633
Yes, ma'am?

20:16.674 --> 20:19.719
Is it true you're suing
Wade Blackwood?

20:19.761 --> 20:22.013
Well, we're suing the
Blackwood County Water Board.

20:22.055 --> 20:25.099
Yeah, but Wade Blackwood
is the president

20:25.141 --> 20:27.518
of the water board,
so you'd be suing Wade Blackwood

20:27.560 --> 20:29.354
and each individual
board member.

20:29.395 --> 20:30.647

- I'm sorry, who are you?
- Someone who knows

20:34.901 --> 20:36.736
most of the people here
are employed

20:36.778 --> 20:39.572
by the Blackwood Almond Company
and Tallgrass Farms,

20:39.614 --> 20:42.367
both owned by Wade Blackwood.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.911
I'm just wondering
if anybody's concerned

20:44.953 --> 20:47.622
about getting fired
for suing their boss.

I really do, but,

21:00.093 --> 21:01.511
uh, I mean, I-I can't speak

21:01.552 --> 21:03.304
to that-that kind
of speculation.

21:03.346 --> 21:05.264
But, uh, yes,
if you're part of the suit,

21:05.306 --> 21:06.683
you would have to sign, yes.

21:06.724 --> 21:10.311
So everyone here
will be suing their boss

21:10.353 --> 21:13.231
unless they specifically
drop out of the lawsuit?

lawyer, then you know that

21:43.011 --> 21:45.805
this is a privileged

You're saying all those people
are your clients?

No. You know better.

23:02.215 --> 23:04.509
It just happens to be
the perfect size

23:04.550 --> 23:08.346

Well, I'll leave that
in your capable hands.

24:32.305 --> 24:34.932
Okay. Well, I hear you.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.369

27:02.330 --> 27:04.040
I'm down here, Joe?

27:38.324 --> 27:40.826
- Hey, Gene.
- Billy.

27:42.536 --> 27:44.121
Thought I'd check on you.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.791
We didn't see you
at the meeting.

27:46.832 --> 27:50.503
I don't want to be a part
of this class action suit.

27:52.546 --> 27:55.174
What do you mean? Why not?

27:55.216 --> 27:57.218
I just don't want to.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.223
Well, you know,
it's the best option we got.

28:02.264 --> 28:03.974
Um... I-I just don't think

28:04.016 --> 28:06.644
we can prove
wrongful death, so...

28:06.685 --> 28:09.146
Well, I don't want
to do anything.

28:09.188 --> 28:11.565
I want to just...

28:11.607 --> 28:13.067
just let it go.

28:13.109 --> 28:15.528
- You want to let it go?
- Mm-hmm.

28:17.530 --> 28:19.573
Well, it's like you said,

28:19.615 --> 28:21.784
I mean, we got to think about
what Bobbi would want.

28:21.826 --> 28:24.495
What Bobbi would have
wanted is if you just

28:24.537 --> 28:27.039
took this fucking case in
the first place before she died.

28:27.081 --> 28:29.208
That's what she wanted.

28:29.250 --> 28:31.377
She came to you as a friend!

28:31.419 --> 28:33.879
Her dear friend, Billy,
and you fucking walked away!

28:33.921 --> 28:36.799
Hang on a goddamn minute, okay?
I'm not a fucking psychic, Gene.

28:36.841 --> 28:38.592
- She trusted you!
- Okay? I don't take every case

28:38.634 --> 28:40.177
- that comes along.
- I trusted you.

28:40.219 --> 28:41.387
I don't know a fucking thing
about water rights.

28:41.429 --> 28:42.930
You're just after
the fucking money,

28:42.972 --> 28:44.807
- this class action.
- It's the best I can do, Gene.

28:44.849 --> 28:46.851
Tell yourself whatever you want.
The thing is,

28:46.892 --> 28:50.521
if you just, just took the
fucking case in the first place,

28:50.563 --> 28:52.898
she would still be alive!

43:40.118 --> 43:43.496
- It'll be good for both of us.
- If.

43:43.538 --> 43:47.375
If we win.

43:47.417 --> 43:49.044
You can't guarantee that,
can you?

43:49.085 --> 43:53.214
No, but I can guarantee
we'll do our best.

44:10.440 --> 44:12.942
Hey.

44:12.984 --> 44:15.153
Gloria. Look,

44:15.195 --> 44:17.655
I totally understand
how you feel, okay?

44:17.697 --> 44:20.742
But if you ever want
to talk things through,

44:20.784 --> 44:22.786
just call the office.

44:22.827 --> 44:24.537
That blond lawyer's
not gonna tell me anything

44:24.579 --> 44:27.874
- I don't already know.
- Then give me a call.

44:27.916 --> 44:30.543
Right?

44:30.585 --> 44:32.587
We can talk.

44:38.051 --> 44:39.719
What're you thinking?

44:41.763 --> 44:44.766
I don't know.

44:44.808 --> 44:47.352
You love this town, right?

44:50.021 --> 44:52.899
There is nobody who could
represent the problem here

44:52.941 --> 44:55.652
better than you.

44:59.531 --> 45:03.368
Okay. I'll be your...
whatever you called it.

45:03.410 --> 45:06.663
Lead plaintiff.

45:11.292 --> 45:12.919
She'll come around.

45:14.587 --> 45:16.589
Good.

45:36.401 --> 45:38.403
(WIND WHISTLING)

45:48.121 --> 45:50.373
Hey!

45:50.415 --> 45:52.292
Can I help you find something?

45:52.333 --> 45:55.253
I don't know
what I'm looking for.

45:57.255 --> 45:59.257
Huh.

45:59.299 --> 46:03.094
Well, you're here for something.

46:03.136 --> 46:05.096
Oh, I just can't
quit thinking about Roy

46:05.138 --> 46:07.015
saying I'm looking in the
wrong direction, I guess.

46:09.392 --> 46:10.685
What, you think his ghost

46:10.727 --> 46:12.479
is gonna point you
in the right one?

46:12.520 --> 46:15.190
- I don't believe in ghosts.
- Well, I sure do.

46:15.231 --> 46:17.442
Maybe that's just
the guilt talking.

46:19.486 --> 46:22.489
I got generations of guilt
on my shoulders.

46:25.283 --> 46:28.453
Is that why you're sitting here?

46:28.495 --> 46:31.039
I'm sitting here because
I lost my best friend.

46:31.080 --> 46:33.208
He had a bad ticker.

46:33.249 --> 46:35.668
And I can't a remember a time
that he wasn't here.

46:37.462 --> 46:38.630
Sorry about that.

46:38.671 --> 46:42.217
Well, I appreciate that.

46:42.258 --> 46:45.512
(SIGHS)

46:45.553 --> 46:48.014
Well, Billy,
since you're here, look...

46:50.058 --> 46:52.852
If I was to offer you
a certain sum

46:52.894 --> 46:55.813
to settle this whole
damn thing right now,

46:55.855 --> 46:57.524
do you think you'd take it?

46:57.565 --> 46:59.943
Is that what Cooperman
told you to do?

47:03.196 --> 47:04.697
Nice move, by the way.

47:04.739 --> 47:06.658
(CHUCKLES)
I have my moments.

47:08.576 --> 47:10.203
(LAUGHING)

47:10.245 --> 47:13.414
Cooperman. Cooperman, ooh.

47:13.456 --> 47:15.792
Wow. That guy.

47:15.833 --> 47:18.419
He really, really wants
to nail your ass.

47:18.461 --> 47:20.505
I don't know what you did
to piss him off.

47:20.547 --> 47:22.465
Yeah, you do.

47:22.507 --> 47:24.509
(SIGHS)

47:27.887 --> 47:30.014
I'm tired.

47:30.056 --> 47:32.559
How old are you, Billy?

47:32.600 --> 47:34.727
- Younger than you.
- Mm-hmm.

47:34.769 --> 47:37.522
I mean,

47:37.564 --> 47:40.233
I could just have
Cooperman's firm

47:40.275 --> 47:42.652
- just reach out to you.
- There's no need to.

47:42.694 --> 47:46.531
I mean, what's the point?
Why drag this all out?

47:46.573 --> 47:48.324
We're both tired.

47:48.366 --> 47:50.326
Oh, I can go all night.

47:52.412 --> 47:56.082
Well...

47:56.124 --> 47:58.876
if you feel that way about it,
I guess I'm just gonna

47:58.918 --> 48:01.004
have to saddle up.

48:06.217 --> 48:10.972
So go ahead
and take a look around.

48:11.014 --> 48:13.516
Don't you take nothing.

48:19.939 --> 48:21.482
(COINS JANGLING)

Billy.

48:24.319 --> 48:26.571
What's up?

48:26.613 --> 48:30.241
I'm gonna take off for a while.

48:30.283 --> 48:32.910
Say adios for now.

48:32.952 --> 48:35.997
Why's that?

48:36.039 --> 48:40.084
I think I screwed up, Billy.

48:40.126 --> 48:42.462
I mean, I screwed up big time.

48:42.503 --> 48:46.341
You know that really nice lady
that got us the information

48:46.382 --> 48:49.302
- from the water board?
- Yeah, Delores.

48:49.344 --> 48:50.511
Yeah.

48:50.553 --> 48:53.848
She's gone.

48:53.890 --> 48:56.184
What do you mean gone?

48:56.225 --> 48:57.810
She disappeared.

48:57.852 --> 49:01.648
She fucking vanished and, uh...

49:01.689 --> 49:03.650
I think I'm responsible.

49:06.444 --> 49:09.489
We're getting really close
to something dangerous here.

49:12.367 --> 49:14.035
Just be careful.

49:14.077 --> 49:16.079
Yeah.

49:20.333 --> 49:24.337
Nothing here is what it seems.

would never be your intention

49:38.893 --> 49:42.105
to hurt anybody.

But if Roy died...

49:47.777 --> 49:49.987
Wade, Wade, Wade, stop.

49:52.031 --> 49:54.242
I loved Roy.

50:03.292 --> 50:06.504
Mm. Roy never understood us.

50:06.546 --> 50:07.714
(DIANA CHUCKLES)

50:07.755 --> 50:10.174
Nobody understands us.

50:10.216 --> 50:12.719
Except us.

50:22.270 --> 50:24.564
- If you did anything...
- I didn't.

50:24.605 --> 50:26.816
I didn't. I didn't.

50:26.858 --> 50:29.360
I didn't. I wouldn't.

50:35.408 --> 50:38.369
Roy was like my dad.

50:38.411 --> 50:40.955
I know, hon.

50:40.997 --> 50:42.999
I know.

50:49.839 --> 50:51.966
And I don't want
to lose you again.

50:52.008 --> 50:55.011
No, no. Never.

50:56.763 --> 50:59.724
But I'm not afraid to.

on it.

after you take a bath.

that my check finally came
from the IRS.

you could get a refund
for burnt money.

No. No, I didn't know that.

- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

This means I won't be hanging
around the Ocean Lodge anymore,

- and-and I just came to say thank you...
- Oh, it's nothing.

54:16.087 --> 54:19.090
...for being nice
and giving me a place to stay.

to go double or nothing

Don't-don't go down that road.
You don't want to do that.

54:29.433 --> 54:32.019
Just k-keep that
and get back on your feet, okay?

54:32.061 --> 54:34.730
Take care of yourself, will you?

Okay.

um, I'll be...

some food there,

- Oh, yeah, I did.

splurge for the suite again?

last time.

were in this hotel before?
