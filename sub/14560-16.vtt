WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:05.639
(electric guitar plays riff
to "This is the End")

00:12.846 --> 00:15.816
* Staring at another
strange ceiling again *

00:15.849 --> 00:18.652
* Though you swore
you'd stay home and read *

00:18.686 --> 00:22.156
* Wondering when
it's all right to leave *

00:22.190 --> 00:26.394
* So you just get dressed...

00:26.427 --> 00:28.196
Still think
this is a bad idea?

00:28.229 --> 00:30.231
I never said
it was a bad idea.

00:30.264 --> 00:32.333
You never said
it was a good one.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.534
* ...Through the cold
morning mist *

00:33.567 --> 00:36.704
* Slightly annoyed
and confused... *

00:36.737 --> 00:38.839
I guess you can't argue with
Charlie's percentage, right?

00:38.872 --> 00:41.709
Why not let him call
the play for once?

00:41.742 --> 00:44.445
CHARLIE: On average, about
every eight years,

00:44.478 --> 00:47.415
a new drug emerges
that becomes the next big thing.

00:47.448 --> 00:48.516
So, heroin gave way
to coke...

00:48.549 --> 00:50.784
Which gave way to PCP...

00:50.818 --> 00:52.553
And then came rock
and then meth.

00:52.586 --> 00:55.589
And I've been doing research
using FBI and DEA databases,

00:55.623 --> 00:57.691
and I think I've identified
the next big threat.

00:59.527 --> 01:01.095
COLBY:
Can you make anything out?

01:01.129 --> 01:03.131
No.

01:03.164 --> 01:04.298
Nothing.

01:04.332 --> 01:06.467
CHARLIE: It's a drug called
"Hawaiian ice."

01:06.500 --> 01:08.602
It's been a problem in Hawaii
for quite some time.

01:08.636 --> 01:11.172
If it makes its way over here,
it'll bring an epidemic

01:11.205 --> 01:13.107
worse than
the crack craze of the '80s.

01:13.141 --> 01:15.843
The good news here is that ice
is still in its infancy.

01:15.876 --> 01:17.311
There's a limited supply.

01:17.345 --> 01:18.479
There's only a handful
of suspected dealers.

01:18.512 --> 01:20.314
So conditions are perfect.

01:20.348 --> 01:21.815
- Perfect for what?
- Well, we don't have to

01:21.849 --> 01:23.784
wait for an epidemic
before we act, do we?

01:23.817 --> 01:25.786
I've got a plan to stop this
now, before it takes off.

01:25.819 --> 01:28.589
A math plan.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.324
Economic modeling theory,
actually.

01:30.358 --> 01:31.859
And the ADIC's already
approved it, so...

01:31.892 --> 01:33.627
- So, what's our angle?
- A limited number

01:33.661 --> 01:35.663
placed correctly,targeted buys,

01:35.696 --> 01:37.431
can disrupt the market and
create powerful disincentives

01:37.465 --> 01:39.200
within the demand base.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.869
Which is a lot of wordsto say we
need to put someone undercover.

01:41.902 --> 01:44.172
Well... yeah.
(chuckles)

01:44.205 --> 01:45.639
I may have an "in."

01:45.673 --> 01:46.640
DON:
Oh, yeah?

01:46.674 --> 01:48.609
Guy I know. DEA.

01:48.642 --> 01:51.345
He's been deep cover
in the L.A. drug scene

01:51.379 --> 01:52.646
for the last three years,

01:52.680 --> 01:54.548
so if we can get word to him
through his handler,

01:54.582 --> 01:57.485
he could make all
the necessary introductions.

01:57.518 --> 02:00.154
- Where is she?
- She'll be here.

02:05.893 --> 02:10.564
Now why would a DEA agent risk
his cover to help out the FBI?

02:10.598 --> 02:12.533
Well, he wouldn't
do it for the FBI.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.502
But he would
do it for me.

02:17.605 --> 02:20.708
* Staring straight ahead,
never looking for answers *

02:20.741 --> 02:23.311
* Dumb yourself down,
it's a great disguise... *

02:23.344 --> 02:25.479
COLBY:
Yeah, Don made the right choice.

02:25.513 --> 02:27.648
No way I could've pulled off
that outfit.

02:27.681 --> 02:30.318
(chuckles)

02:30.351 --> 02:32.453
DON: David, I want you to be
her handler.

02:32.486 --> 02:35.356
Granger's got a lot more
undercover experience than me.

02:35.389 --> 02:37.425
He didn't just apply
for a promotion.

02:37.458 --> 02:39.493
You're on; just make sure
she doesn't get hurt.

02:39.527 --> 02:41.262
All right.

02:42.630 --> 02:43.597
Ryan...

02:43.631 --> 02:46.467
meet Liz.

02:48.236 --> 02:51.405
(sighs)
You stick to the plan, okay?

02:52.706 --> 02:54.675
You decent?

02:54.708 --> 02:57.345
Uh...
I don't know; you tell me.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.382
(sighs)
Will you zip me up?

03:01.415 --> 03:03.217
Yeah. Um...

03:03.251 --> 03:04.618
Listen, uh, Colby and I,

03:04.652 --> 03:06.820
we're gonna have eyes on you
the whole time, okay?

03:06.854 --> 03:09.523
So, if you feel weird
about anything at all,

03:09.557 --> 03:11.992
just... you give us
the sign, okay?

03:12.025 --> 03:13.727
I'll be fine, don't worry.

03:13.761 --> 03:15.229
All right, and remember, this is
your meet, okay?

03:15.263 --> 03:16.163
You're in control.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.399
So you don't let this guy
set your terms

03:18.432 --> 03:20.601
or your locations.

03:20.634 --> 03:23.437
Also, we're not set up
for a rolling surveillance,

03:23.471 --> 03:25.639
- so I need you to stay put.
- Roger that.

03:25.673 --> 03:28.309
All right, let's not
waste any time.

03:28.342 --> 03:30.344
I'm after 50 keys,

03:30.378 --> 03:31.345
80% pure or better.

03:31.379 --> 03:33.281
Slow down. Not here.

03:34.782 --> 03:36.250
What do you mean?

03:37.651 --> 03:39.653
No need to get
all frazzled.

03:39.687 --> 03:42.823
Maybe I'd like to get
to know her better.

03:42.856 --> 03:45.326
If that means putting
your hands on my ass,

03:45.359 --> 03:46.627
you can forget about it.

03:46.660 --> 03:47.861
I just don't like it here.

03:47.895 --> 03:51.665
But if you wanna talk,
I... I know a place.

03:51.699 --> 03:53.734
Otherwise...

03:53.767 --> 03:56.704
* This is the end,
though I saw it coming... *

03:56.737 --> 03:58.772
CHARLIE: And this doesn't have
to be a single event, either.

03:58.806 --> 04:01.442
There are probably dozens
of ways

04:01.475 --> 04:02.510
to adapt this model
to other crime areas.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.745
Let's just see where we land
on this, all right?

04:04.778 --> 04:06.280
- Good luck, you guys.
- Good luck.

04:06.314 --> 04:08.382
Don't worry.
This is gonna work.

04:08.416 --> 04:09.383
I'm not worried.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.752
You just better be right.

04:11.785 --> 04:16.290
You wanna blow a deal over
something as stupid as this?

04:16.324 --> 04:19.493
It's a nice day.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.496
Let's go for a ride.

04:28.669 --> 04:29.970
Don't even think about it.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.841
* This is the end...

04:33.874 --> 04:36.410
Liz, that is not part
of the plan.

04:36.444 --> 04:39.547
* ...before we went to bed,
no, I never could be... *

04:39.580 --> 04:41.549
That's the thing
about plans, man.

04:41.582 --> 04:42.783
They're great right up
until the minute

04:42.816 --> 04:43.917
you put 'em
into action.

04:45.553 --> 04:47.655
* This is the end

04:47.688 --> 04:50.958
* Though I saw it coming
before we started *

04:50.991 --> 04:55.295
* And no one's gonna
be brokenhearted here... *

05:08.008 --> 05:09.477
Hey...

05:09.510 --> 05:11.111
I warned you about the hands.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.913
CAM:
C'mon, man, what'd I tell you?

05:12.946 --> 05:14.582
There's nothing to worry about.

05:14.615 --> 05:18.018
Well, I feel better
checking for myself, Cam.

05:18.051 --> 05:20.621
You know they've got meds now.
Might help with the paranoia.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.456
(chuckles)

05:22.490 --> 05:24.592
I don't know you.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.727
If Cam hadn't
vouched for you,

05:26.760 --> 05:28.662
you and I, we wouldn't
even be talking.

05:28.696 --> 05:29.763
Are we talking?

05:29.797 --> 05:31.832
'Cause it still feels
like we're screwing around.

05:31.865 --> 05:34.902
Bottom line: I represent
some people in Seattle.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.404
And they're looking
to get their hands

05:36.437 --> 05:39.640
on as much Hawaiian ice
as you can put together.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.810
Well, supplies are kind
of tight right now.

05:42.843 --> 05:46.480
Yeah, I told her
that could be a problem.

05:46.514 --> 05:50.484
I'm offering 50% over
current market rate.

05:50.518 --> 05:51.785
(sighs)

05:51.819 --> 05:53.921
50% over?

05:58.459 --> 06:01.128
DAVID: Just heard from Liz.
Duneaux took the bait. We're in.

06:01.161 --> 06:03.564
All right, so he's
willing to deal to us?

06:03.597 --> 06:04.932
Yeah, your plan's
in motion, Charlie.

06:04.965 --> 06:06.600
One down, three to go.

06:06.634 --> 06:08.068
DON:
Guys, this is Teri Green.

06:08.101 --> 06:10.170
She's DEA, and
Cam's handler.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.705
Thanks for letting
us borrow him.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.607
Don't thank me.
I was against it.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.142
Why is that? You're not
sold on Charlie's plan?

06:15.175 --> 06:17.077
I have other priorities.

06:17.110 --> 06:20.414
Besides, even if you do buy
up all the ice in town,

06:20.448 --> 06:22.082
how's that anything
but a temporary fix?

06:22.115 --> 06:24.017
I mean, more's going to show up
eventually.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.653
CHARLIE: Probably,
but by then

06:25.686 --> 06:28.622
we'll have significantly damaged
their consumer base.

06:28.656 --> 06:31.625
See, in marketing economics,
it's called

06:31.659 --> 06:32.893
"dirtying the brand."

06:32.926 --> 06:35.162
Now, let's say you, um...
let's say you've got

06:35.195 --> 06:37.130
a favorite coffee shop
that you go to

06:37.164 --> 06:39.567
every morning
to get your morning fix.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.869
Now, what if each day
you go to the coffee shop,

06:41.902 --> 06:44.605
you find that they have raised
their prices?

06:44.638 --> 06:46.006
And what's more,

06:46.039 --> 06:50.010
as prices go up, the quality
of the coffee declines.

06:50.043 --> 06:52.646
It becomes more diluted;
more watered down.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.715
There's only so much of that
you're gonna tolerate

06:54.748 --> 06:57.150
before you never go back
to that coffee shop again.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.919
Add to that negative
word-of-mouth,

06:58.952 --> 07:00.821
and pretty soon,
there's no more coffee shop.

07:00.854 --> 07:03.891
Imagine that happening all over
town as coffee supplies dwindle.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.659
It's the same with Hawaiian ice.

07:05.693 --> 07:08.228
We buy up the supplies,
and the street prices rise.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.464
COLBY: And the quality
will go down as dealers

07:10.498 --> 07:12.733
try and stretch out the
little bit they have left.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.602
Yeah, by the time the dealers
are resupplied,

07:14.635 --> 07:17.237
they've permanently lost 80-85%
of their consumer base.

07:17.270 --> 07:21.008
We've successfully
"dirtied the brand."

07:21.041 --> 07:23.010
How long before I
get my agent back?

07:23.043 --> 07:25.613
Couple days. I mean, it's
gotta happen fast. Right?

07:25.646 --> 07:27.748
- Yeah.
- Keep me posted.

07:27.781 --> 07:30.017
All right. David?

07:30.050 --> 07:31.218
Yeah.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.653
You good?

07:32.686 --> 07:33.954
Yeah, the-the meet went down
smooth.

07:33.987 --> 07:34.955
It was good.

07:34.988 --> 07:35.956
Yeah.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.190
All right.

07:46.967 --> 07:50.137
(sighs)

07:50.170 --> 07:53.040
Thanks... for doing this.

07:53.073 --> 07:55.709
You know, I wasn't sure
if it was...

07:55.743 --> 07:57.978
Oh, you knew I would.

07:58.011 --> 07:59.647
(laughs)

07:59.680 --> 08:03.584
Just to see a familiar
face. Come on!

08:03.617 --> 08:05.519
It's almost surreal.

08:05.553 --> 08:07.688
Three years.

08:07.721 --> 08:10.558
That's a long time to be
undercover.

08:10.591 --> 08:13.527
Gotta be tough.

08:13.561 --> 08:15.696
Gets easier
the more time goes by...

08:15.729 --> 08:18.766
I think.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.536
Look at you.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.638
Back in Narc training,
you didn't even drink.

08:24.672 --> 08:26.640
And now, what? You're
the drug prince of L.A.?

08:26.674 --> 08:29.076
Why do you think
we never hooked up back then?

08:29.109 --> 08:31.645
Uh... you were married.

08:31.679 --> 08:34.682
You're too good of a guy
to cheat on your wife.

08:34.715 --> 08:37.585
It's too bad I didn't know
she was going to cheat on me.

08:37.618 --> 08:41.755
That's what got you here.

08:41.789 --> 08:44.692
The ultimate way to put it
behind you, right?

08:46.794 --> 08:49.663
Thank you, doctor, for
a very fruitful session.

08:49.697 --> 08:53.033
I'm waiting on a call-back
from Paloma about tonight.

08:53.066 --> 08:56.336
And I will put you together
with Haseikian tomorrow morning.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.707
All right, what about
the fourth guy, Pritchard?

08:59.740 --> 09:01.709
The file says
he could be trouble.

09:01.742 --> 09:04.077
That's why we'll
save him for last.

09:04.111 --> 09:07.848
Well, I'm glad
you've got my back.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.050
I'm glad to have it.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.757
Especially when
it looks like that.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.930
CHARLIE:
Oh, that sounds perfect, Colby.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.632
Uh-huh, thanks.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.634
It's almost as if
we planned it that way.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.969
(chuckles):
All right, take it easy.

09:29.002 --> 09:30.704
So, Liz met
with the second dealer.

09:30.738 --> 09:33.140
He's in. I really think
this plan's gonna work.

09:33.173 --> 09:34.908
Of course it will.
That's why Don is doing it.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.810
Yeah, and you know what the
funny thing is,

09:36.844 --> 09:39.246
I almost didn't
take it to him,

09:39.279 --> 09:40.981
thing when he asks me for help,

09:41.014 --> 09:42.716
but to go in completely
unsolicited is like...

09:42.750 --> 09:45.318
Don't be silly.
This is a solid economic model.

09:45.352 --> 09:46.954
Once this case works out,
who knows?

09:46.987 --> 09:49.056
Like, the predictive flow
algorithms

09:49.089 --> 09:50.991
I'm using for drugs here
could apply

09:51.024 --> 09:53.694
equally well with-with weapons
smuggling and... (laughs)

09:53.727 --> 09:55.262
Then this could just
be the start.

09:55.295 --> 09:56.229
Yeah.

09:57.831 --> 09:58.732
Oh, hey.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.367
- How was the game?
- How was the game?

10:00.400 --> 10:02.135
I've probably not been
to a worse

10:02.169 --> 10:03.837
basketball game
in my entire life.

10:03.871 --> 10:05.405
(chuckles)
CalSci got-- phew-- crushed.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.075
You know, an interesting fact
about the CalSci team is

10:08.108 --> 10:09.743
there're actually more
high school valedictorians

10:09.777 --> 10:12.746
on the squad than guys that
played high school basketball.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.715
Yeah, well, tonight, they played
like a bunch of valedictorians.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.216
- Hey!
- Watch it now.

10:16.249 --> 10:18.686
Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I forgot.
You were both valedictorians.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.988
But hey, come on. How could you
lose to Bremmer College?

10:21.021 --> 10:22.189
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

10:22.222 --> 10:24.057
we kick their ass every year
in science research funding.

10:24.091 --> 10:28.128
Surprisingly, Charlie, it
doesn't make me feel any better.

10:28.161 --> 10:30.263
LIZ: Come on, David. Lighten
up. It worked out fine.

10:30.297 --> 10:33.033
Fine so far, but you keep
playing it loose like this,

10:33.066 --> 10:34.434
you don't think that's
gonna catch up with you?

10:34.467 --> 10:36.003
Whoa, hey!
What's the problem?

10:36.036 --> 10:38.005
I had to improvise.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.673
You chose to improvise twice,

10:39.707 --> 10:42.175
both times putting yourself
at unnecessary risk.

10:42.209 --> 10:44.044
Can you stop yelling?

10:44.077 --> 10:46.013
Stop. Enough!
All of you, in here now.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.881
What did I do?

10:47.915 --> 10:49.683
Okay, I strayed
from the playbook,

10:49.717 --> 10:50.951
but the situation
changed.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.686
I had to go with it.

10:52.720 --> 10:53.787
Besides, Cam was there.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.723
Cam is not your handler, okay?

10:55.756 --> 10:57.190
If anything goes
bad out there,

10:57.224 --> 11:00.293
this guy, he's gonna be too busy
covering his own ass.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.795
All right, calm down now.

11:01.829 --> 11:02.996
What do you have to say?

11:03.030 --> 11:06.734
I mean, look, Liz is putting
a lot of trust in this Cam guy.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.068
Thank you. Too much trust.

11:08.101 --> 11:09.202
But undercover work

11:09.236 --> 11:10.137
is spur-of-the-moment,

11:10.170 --> 11:11.939
you have to go with the tools
you have.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.874
Right, so just get me
straight here.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.976
We've met with three out of the
four, is that right?

11:16.009 --> 11:17.845
LIZ: Yes. Duneaux and Paloma
yesterday,

11:17.878 --> 11:19.212
Haseikian this morning.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.480
And they all want in.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.983
They're putting together product
to make a deal.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.918
The only one left is Pritchard,
but this guy worries me.

11:24.952 --> 11:25.853
He has a violent
reputation.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.354
I understand.
Can we do it without him?

11:27.387 --> 11:28.956
No, this guy controls

11:28.989 --> 11:31.291
40% of the ice in L.A.
There's no way around him.

11:31.324 --> 11:32.960
Okay, fine,
so we take it to him.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.895
You listen to David

11:34.928 --> 11:37.798
and no more stupid risks,
and you give her some leash.

11:40.467 --> 11:42.235
All right.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.210
You better hope
you don't have a daughter.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.212
What are you
talking about?

11:52.245 --> 11:55.816
Can you imagine how you're gonna
be when she turns 16?

12:13.366 --> 12:15.468
Okay, so this guy's

12:15.502 --> 12:18.872
reputation is totally
undeserved, right?

12:18.906 --> 12:19.973
(chuckles)
I don't think

12:20.007 --> 12:21.241
you want me
to lie to you.

12:21.274 --> 12:24.945
By the way, I told him
you're my girlfriend.

12:24.978 --> 12:27.447
Wow, you work fast.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.850
I didn't even know
we were dating.

12:29.883 --> 12:31.952
Listen, Pritchard's
a creep.

12:31.985 --> 12:36.990
I figured it'd keep him off you
if he thinks we're together.

12:37.024 --> 12:39.359
Okay, are there any details
about us I should know about?

12:39.392 --> 12:42.863
Tell him whatever you want

12:42.896 --> 12:44.464
as long as it makes
me look good.

12:44.497 --> 12:46.233
(scoffs)

12:46.266 --> 12:47.935
Actually, you don't
look good.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.803
You all right?

12:49.837 --> 12:53.140
You've been my girlfriend
for what, 30 seconds?

12:53.173 --> 12:54.441
You're already starting in.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.810
Here it is.

12:59.412 --> 13:02.449
(knocking, door opens,
punk rock blaring)

13:02.482 --> 13:05.118
Hey, what's up, Mickey, huh?

13:05.152 --> 13:08.155
Hey, there.
Where's my man at?

13:10.357 --> 13:11.925
- What up, bro?
- There he is.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.126
Come here.

13:14.594 --> 13:17.197
I want you to meet my girl.
This is Liz.

13:17.230 --> 13:20.901
So, she's... what you're
into now, huh?

13:20.934 --> 13:24.104
Looks like you'd have
to defrost her first.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.939
Hey, be nice.

13:25.973 --> 13:27.540
She might be bringing you
a whole lot of business.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.442
In there.

13:38.585 --> 13:39.887
Cam tells me
you're from Seattle.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.955
Yep.

13:41.989 --> 13:43.590
(sighs)

13:43.623 --> 13:45.893
I hate Seattle.

13:45.926 --> 13:49.863
I'll be sure
never to invite you up.

13:52.032 --> 13:56.136
Cam, man, you
look like crap.

13:56.169 --> 13:59.072
You want something?

13:59.106 --> 14:00.974
No.

14:01.008 --> 14:02.375
I'm good.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.177
Listen, I'm looking
to get a hold

14:04.211 --> 14:06.046
of as much Hawaiian ice
as you can put together.

14:06.079 --> 14:11.018
And why would I want
to do business with you?

14:11.051 --> 14:13.353
Money's not motivation enough?

14:13.386 --> 14:16.089
There's more to life than money.

14:16.123 --> 14:18.525
My offer is way above
what you normally get.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.227
For that price,

14:20.260 --> 14:22.963
maybe you can drop
the sophomoric innuendo.

14:22.996 --> 14:25.065
Tell me whether or not
we're in business.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.173
I'll be back
in a minute, okay?

14:39.146 --> 14:43.616
So... we have a deal?

14:47.020 --> 14:48.989
(cocks, then uncocks gun)

14:54.561 --> 14:55.595
Take off your top.

14:55.628 --> 15:00.167
(chuckles)

15:00.200 --> 15:02.102
I don't need your business
that badly.

15:02.135 --> 15:05.372
You're not doing it
for my business.

15:05.405 --> 15:08.041
You're doing it
because I told you to.

15:08.075 --> 15:11.278
And... I have the gun.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.316
(mouthing)

15:45.312 --> 15:46.279
Now the skirt.

15:59.592 --> 16:01.694
Turn around.

16:04.164 --> 16:07.134
(sighs)

16:33.126 --> 16:35.595
Just want to make sure
you're not wearing a wire.

16:38.465 --> 16:39.432
All right.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.036
100 keys...

16:43.070 --> 16:45.205
seven grand each.

16:45.238 --> 16:48.608
I'll call Cam,
we'll set it up.

16:55.215 --> 16:56.216
Liz...

16:56.249 --> 16:57.517
Hey.

16:57.550 --> 16:58.585
Where were you?

16:58.618 --> 16:59.752
I was in the bathroom.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.254
I figured he'd quit
screwing around

17:01.288 --> 17:03.223
if he didn't have an audience.
Wasn't I right?

17:03.256 --> 17:05.258
You son of a bitch.

17:05.292 --> 17:07.160
What?

17:07.194 --> 17:08.128
You're using.

17:08.161 --> 17:10.163
Oh, come...

17:10.197 --> 17:11.164
Oh, that's nuts.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.532
Don't play me, Cam.

17:12.565 --> 17:15.168
You weren't sick.
You were jonesing!

17:15.202 --> 17:18.338
A lump of meth? What?ttle smack?

17:18.371 --> 17:20.307
This isn't training anymore.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.375
There are times a guy
sticks a gun to your head,

17:22.409 --> 17:24.244
and you got to fix
to show you're legit.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.413
I didn't see a gun
to your head...

17:26.446 --> 17:28.315
What do you want to do, huh?
You want to go to your guys?

17:28.348 --> 17:30.283
You want to shut down
three years of my work?

17:30.317 --> 17:31.484
Come on, Liz.

17:31.518 --> 17:34.454
Get the hell away
from me.

17:34.487 --> 17:35.255
Check this out.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.557
Daily crime stats
from the LAPD.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.692
Street price of Hawaiian ice
is already going up.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.361
Wow.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.562
Check this out.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.397
We haven't made a single buy
yet. It can't be a shortage.

17:44.431 --> 17:46.133
CHARLIE:
There isn't.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.700
We've created the anticipation
of a shortage,

17:47.734 --> 17:49.302
which has the same
initial market effects

17:49.336 --> 17:51.471
as an actual shortage,
and my guess is

17:51.504 --> 17:53.640
that there's also been an effect
on the quality of ice

17:53.673 --> 17:55.142
that's on
the street.

17:55.175 --> 17:57.710
So, this isn't news to you.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.579
No, this is precisely in line
with what my models predicted.

17:59.612 --> 18:00.780
LIZ:
Hey.

18:00.813 --> 18:02.115
Four for four.

18:02.149 --> 18:03.550
Nice. Pritchard's in?

18:03.583 --> 18:05.518
He's getting it together.

18:05.552 --> 18:07.454
DON:
Yeah?

18:07.487 --> 18:08.688
So, everything went all right?
No problems?

18:09.789 --> 18:10.723
No, none at all.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.360
I don't know what all
the hype was about.

18:13.393 --> 18:15.128
Guy was easy.

18:15.162 --> 18:16.763
All right, so making the buys is
the next step.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.565
Cam's setting up
the time and places, right?

18:18.598 --> 18:20.667
Uh, yeah, yeah,
he's on it.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.569
DAVID:
And from now on,

18:22.602 --> 18:24.371
I want you wearing a wire, okay?

18:24.404 --> 18:26.506
And we'll also need it for
evidence down the line.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.408
You good with that?

18:28.441 --> 18:30.643
Yeah, I mean,
meet-and-greets are over,

18:30.677 --> 18:32.579
and they've already had
time to check me out,

18:32.612 --> 18:34.847
so... yeah,
whatever, wire me.

18:34.881 --> 18:36.783
All right,
let's make this happen.

18:40.187 --> 18:41.754
Hey.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.657
I want you to just play it
close on her, all right?

18:44.691 --> 18:46.259
- You think something's up?
- I don't know.

18:46.293 --> 18:47.694
I'm not sure she's
telling us everything.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.162
All right, man,
I'll talk to her.

18:49.196 --> 18:50.763
No, just
play it tight.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.432
All right,
absolutely.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.169
LIZ:
Teri.

18:56.203 --> 18:57.670
Excuse me.
You have a second?

18:57.704 --> 18:59.572
I'll catch up.

18:59.606 --> 19:01.674
Listen.

19:01.708 --> 19:03.910
It's about Cam.

19:03.943 --> 19:06.913
I think maybe he's
been under too long.

19:06.946 --> 19:07.947
You think so?

19:07.980 --> 19:09.816
You've been working with him,
what, 72 hours?

19:09.849 --> 19:11.918
I've been with him
for three and a half years.

19:11.951 --> 19:13.386
He's using.

19:13.420 --> 19:14.887
My guess is a lot.

19:18.525 --> 19:20.460
Did you actually
see him use?

19:20.493 --> 19:22.329
Could you testify to that fact?

19:22.362 --> 19:24.297
What does that have to do
with anything?

19:24.331 --> 19:25.798
I'm talking
about his well-being.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.834
No, you're talking
about probably the DEA's

19:27.867 --> 19:30.370
most valuable asset
in L.A. right now.

19:30.403 --> 19:31.804
Do you have any idea
the number of cases

19:31.838 --> 19:34.541
that get made based on the
information that he feeds out?

19:34.574 --> 19:36.409
So, as long as he's under,
you look good?

19:36.443 --> 19:37.810
This isn't FBI
Narcotics, Agent.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.846
The DEA is a whole different
ball game.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.848
So, screw Cam?

19:41.881 --> 19:42.682
We're doing you a favor.

19:42.715 --> 19:43.916
You want to come in here

19:43.950 --> 19:45.785
and blow everything
that we've put in place?

19:45.818 --> 19:46.853
I don't think so.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.588
Cam is fine.

19:48.621 --> 19:51.658
He can handle it.
(buzzing)

19:51.691 --> 19:53.826
That's just what
an addict would say.

19:53.860 --> 19:59.566
What do you know, your addict
just set up your first buy.

20:05.838 --> 20:07.240
LIZ (over speaker): I always get
self-conscious wearing a wire.

20:07.274 --> 20:08.841
Where is the video?

20:08.875 --> 20:10.710
I don't know, like you guys
can hear my thoughts...

20:10.743 --> 20:13.246
It's coming up
right now.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.315
Of course, if you could
hear my thoughts right now,

20:15.348 --> 20:18.818
it would just be,
"Burger and fries."

20:18.851 --> 20:20.853
Why didn't we eat
before we came?

20:22.922 --> 20:24.724
First guest
has arrived.

20:35.535 --> 20:37.370
I gotta apologize.

20:37.404 --> 20:38.838
I know how bad
it must...

20:38.871 --> 20:39.906
(static, crackling)

20:39.939 --> 20:41.874
What the hell
is she doing?

20:41.908 --> 20:43.376
LIZ:
Sorry, guys.

20:43.410 --> 20:44.777
I got to adjust this mic.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.779
I'll be right back.

20:47.847 --> 20:51.784
(garbled voices, crackling)

20:51.818 --> 20:53.286
So?

20:53.320 --> 20:54.421
I screwed up.

20:54.454 --> 20:55.888
Yeah, you did.

20:55.922 --> 20:58.024
I've just been working solo
for so long.

20:58.057 --> 21:00.793
I'm so used to it
being my own ass on the line.

21:00.827 --> 21:02.862
I just
didn't think.

21:02.895 --> 21:04.897
But if you got hurt
for something I did...

21:09.636 --> 21:10.637
It won't happen again.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.006
That's a promise.

21:15.942 --> 21:18.978
Better not.

21:19.011 --> 21:19.979
All right, you guys,

21:20.012 --> 21:21.080
I'm back.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.815
We're good.

21:22.849 --> 21:25.318
What the hell was that about?

21:25.352 --> 21:26.853
You got me.

21:26.886 --> 21:28.821
Here they come.

21:34.994 --> 21:36.095
CAM:
What's up, player?

21:36.128 --> 21:37.897
PALOMA:
Always got the plan.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.466
Good?
Yeah.

21:39.499 --> 21:40.767
All right.

21:40.800 --> 21:41.801
You'll be happy.

21:41.834 --> 21:44.804
I was able to pull together
the full 50 kilos.

21:44.837 --> 21:46.873
How thrilled should I be?

21:46.906 --> 21:48.741
50's what we agreed on.

21:48.775 --> 21:50.543
CAM:
Mind if I take a look?

21:50.577 --> 21:51.844
PALOMA:
Oh, yeah.

21:51.878 --> 21:53.913
(zipper unzips)

21:57.517 --> 21:59.085
You don't have to worry
about the quality.

21:59.118 --> 22:01.320
LIZ:
Yes, I do.

22:03.390 --> 22:04.924
PALOMA:
Of course.

22:04.957 --> 22:06.993
CAM:
Just checking, baby.

22:07.026 --> 22:08.828
Yeah, right.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.329
(zipper zips up)

22:12.999 --> 22:14.100
It's been a pleasure, baby.

22:14.133 --> 22:15.568
LIZ:
Glad to hear it.

22:22.008 --> 22:24.010
Can we get something
to eat now?

22:28.114 --> 22:29.816
Hey.
Hey.

22:29.849 --> 22:32.485
So, are you still on a high
over the success of your plan?

22:32.519 --> 22:34.521
It could become addicting.

22:34.554 --> 22:35.755
Okay, I know I started.

22:35.788 --> 22:37.023
And you're afraid
you'll OD.

22:37.056 --> 22:38.958
Okay, seriously, Charlie, stop.

22:38.991 --> 22:40.627
I am glad
it's going well.

22:40.660 --> 22:41.694
ALAN:
Hey. Hey, listen.

22:41.728 --> 22:44.531
Guess what? I did some checking
into exactly how bad

22:44.564 --> 22:45.532
the CalSci
basketball team is.

22:45.565 --> 22:46.633
Do you realize that

22:46.666 --> 22:48.134
they haven't won a game
since 1986?

22:48.167 --> 22:49.436
Yeah, everybody knows that.

22:49.469 --> 22:50.302
What, they're going on, like,

22:50.336 --> 22:52.805
270 consecutive losses
or something.

22:52.839 --> 22:54.774
Two hundred eighty-three.

22:54.807 --> 22:55.908
That doesn't bother you?

22:55.942 --> 22:56.776
You know,
to be honest, Alan,

22:56.809 --> 22:58.945
I don't really
follow sports. Sorry.

22:58.978 --> 23:00.680
CHARLIE: Why does it
bother you so much?

23:00.713 --> 23:02.048
I mean, what happened
to all that, uh,

23:02.081 --> 23:03.583
"it doesn't matter
if you win or lose" stuff

23:03.616 --> 23:04.817
you preached
when we were growing up?

23:04.851 --> 23:06.052
Charlie, that's when
you were a kid.

23:06.085 --> 23:08.054
And no offense,
I knew we weren't

23:08.087 --> 23:09.188
looking at the possibility

23:09.221 --> 23:10.189
of an athletic
scholarship.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.190
Gee, thanks.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.625
What he means
is he knew

23:12.659 --> 23:14.427
you wouldn't need
an athletic scholarship.

23:14.461 --> 23:17.029
Look, with a team so smart,

23:17.063 --> 23:19.566
why can't they figure out a way
to win a game?

23:19.599 --> 23:21.768
You know, you have
a good point, Alan.

23:21.801 --> 23:22.969
I mean, there's a lot of math

23:23.002 --> 23:24.170
being used to improve
sports performance.

23:24.203 --> 23:25.838
Why not apply some of it

23:25.872 --> 23:26.673
to the basketball program?

23:26.706 --> 23:28.107
I mean, what do you think,
Charlie?

23:28.140 --> 23:29.742
Yes, I mean,
is one win

23:29.776 --> 23:31.578
asking too much?

23:31.611 --> 23:33.012
Well, as much
as I hate to indulge

23:33.045 --> 23:34.481
this newfound dark side
of yours,

23:34.514 --> 23:36.916
my drug plan's pretty much
on autopilot.

23:36.949 --> 23:38.918
I seem to be on a roll,
so yeah, why not?

23:38.951 --> 23:40.620
And for the record,

23:40.653 --> 23:42.088
I was a pretty awesome swimmer.

23:42.121 --> 23:43.790
Mm...

23:54.634 --> 23:56.669
Here he comes.

23:56.703 --> 23:57.704
Guy's a pussycat.

23:57.737 --> 23:59.539
No worries.

23:59.572 --> 24:01.140
Let's not get
too overconfident, okay?

24:11.651 --> 24:13.252
(automatic gunfire)

24:13.285 --> 24:13.920
Let's go! Let's go!

24:16.756 --> 24:17.857
Go get the bag!

24:17.890 --> 24:19.626
Go! Go!

24:24.196 --> 24:25.031
Go!

24:32.705 --> 24:34.073
You okay?

24:34.106 --> 24:36.075
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

24:37.009 --> 24:39.011
Get out the way.

24:39.045 --> 24:40.980
What the hell
just happened here?

24:50.857 --> 24:52.992
(helicopter whirring overhead)

24:55.962 --> 24:56.963
What happened?

24:56.996 --> 24:58.030
Still piecing
things together.

24:58.064 --> 24:59.165
Liz is fine though.

24:59.198 --> 25:00.667
Liz, Cam, they
weren't the targets.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.635
They were after Duneaux,
the dealer.

25:02.669 --> 25:03.970
Duneaux popped
one of their guys.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.271
Other two took off
in that direction,

25:05.304 --> 25:06.405
green Expedition.

25:06.438 --> 25:08.675
DEA's gonna be pissed
if we burned this guy's cover.

25:08.708 --> 25:10.142
We have Cam stashed
in the hangar.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.011
I thought it'd be best
to keep him out of sight.

25:12.044 --> 25:12.879
What do you got, Liz?

25:12.912 --> 25:14.747
Um, you know,
I recognize this guy.

25:14.781 --> 25:15.915
- Nickname's Pinky.
- Uh-huh.

25:15.948 --> 25:17.083
LIZ: He worked for Pritchard.

25:17.116 --> 25:18.618
One drug dealer
ripping off another?

25:18.651 --> 25:19.852
COLBY: You got to figure,
word's out

25:19.886 --> 25:21.754
Pritchard'd want to get together

25:21.788 --> 25:23.322
as much product
as he can.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.191
What better way than
rip off another dealer?

25:25.224 --> 25:26.358
DAVID:
Wait a minute.

25:26.392 --> 25:29.161
These guys hit right as
you were meeting with Duneaux.

25:29.195 --> 25:30.162
COLBY:
Perfect time.

25:30.196 --> 25:31.964
They knew
he'd have the drugs.

25:31.998 --> 25:34.066
DON: So, what, they knew the
time and place?

25:34.100 --> 25:37.804
Exactly. Somebody told Pritchard
that the deal was going down.

25:44.276 --> 25:46.012
What's the word?

25:46.045 --> 25:47.680
When we getting out of here?

25:47.714 --> 25:49.248
Did you tell Pritchard
about the buy?

25:49.281 --> 25:50.617
Did I what?

25:50.650 --> 25:51.818
Those were Pritchard's guys
out there.

25:51.851 --> 25:53.219
They knew the exact
where and when

25:53.252 --> 25:54.086
to intercept
Duneaux's drugs.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.989
So I want to know
did you tell him?

25:57.023 --> 25:59.158
That's one hell
of an accusation.

25:59.191 --> 26:00.292
Is it?

26:00.326 --> 26:02.829
You're using, and Pritchard
supplies you with drugs.

26:02.862 --> 26:04.664
So how big of a leap is it

26:04.697 --> 26:05.632
to assume you're
into something deeper?

26:05.665 --> 26:07.700
I don't know how Pritchard
found out, okay?

26:07.734 --> 26:10.002
But it wasn't from me.

26:10.036 --> 26:13.272
I wish I could believe you.

26:15.341 --> 26:17.677
Never mind
that I just saved your life.

26:21.981 --> 26:23.382
Okay, here's another one
that looks interesting.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.084
This is an analysis suggesting

26:25.117 --> 26:28.788
that a slower game tempo is
beneficial to the underdog team.

26:28.821 --> 26:30.890
Underdog? Yeah, well,
that would be CalSci.

26:30.923 --> 26:33.660
Yeah, all right,
let's put it on the board.

26:33.693 --> 26:35.127
And you know what else
I think we should look at?

26:35.161 --> 26:37.263
And this will probably require
Larry's expertise.

26:37.296 --> 26:38.297
Go to Larry?

26:38.330 --> 26:39.932
- For basketball?
- Well, yeah, physics, Dad.

26:39.966 --> 26:42.802
There's got to be an
optimum arc for a shot

26:42.835 --> 26:44.236
that'll maximize its chances
of going in.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.238
- Oh, yeah, good point.
- Ah, I...

26:46.272 --> 26:47.273
(phone ringing)
Put it up.

26:47.306 --> 26:49.141
All right, you put it up.

26:49.175 --> 26:50.977
Okay.
Hello.

26:51.010 --> 26:52.344
Alan, I really think
we're on to something.

26:52.378 --> 26:53.479
Yeah, well, let's hope so.

26:53.512 --> 26:56.182
You know, I really appreciate
you doing this, Amita,

26:56.215 --> 26:57.884
because I know how
you hate basketball.

26:57.917 --> 27:00.386
I don't hate basketball.

27:00.419 --> 27:01.420
You got to be
kidding me.

27:01.453 --> 27:02.755
ALAN:
What is it?

27:02.789 --> 27:04.356
What's wrong, Charlie?

27:07.994 --> 27:09.896
My model didn't predict
anything like this.

27:09.929 --> 27:10.897
Charlie.

27:10.930 --> 27:12.899
I went wrong somewhere.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.771
The question is:
where does this put us?

27:18.805 --> 27:19.939
My cover's still intact.

27:19.972 --> 27:21.974
No, no, no, Pritchard is
too much of a wild card, okay?

27:22.008 --> 27:23.710
We're going
to go put a pin in him

27:23.743 --> 27:24.777
and go after Haseikian.

27:24.811 --> 27:26.278
Uh-uh, can't.
He's dead.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.748
They hit his boat
last night.

27:28.781 --> 27:29.749
And by "they,"
you mean Pritchard.

27:29.782 --> 27:31.818
Yeah, probably before
they did the airport.

27:31.851 --> 27:33.385
Which means
Pritchard now controls

27:33.419 --> 27:35.154
most of the ice out there.

27:35.187 --> 27:37.223
Hey, I screwed up.
I'm sorry.

27:37.256 --> 27:38.457
No, Charlie,
it's not your fault.

27:38.490 --> 27:40.059
Well, I put the plan
into motion.

27:40.092 --> 27:41.293
I should have at least
predicted it.

27:41.327 --> 27:43.429
You know, normally when
a market is squeezed,

27:43.462 --> 27:45.431
suppliers adapt by moving
into new product lines,

27:45.464 --> 27:47.700
or they just bow out
of the market entirely.

27:47.734 --> 27:49.769
But drug dealers don't react
in a normal fashion.

27:49.802 --> 27:51.771
Right, so I've, I've
corrected the, the model here.

27:51.804 --> 27:54.306
No, I-I don't think
we can do it anymore.

27:54.340 --> 27:55.775
Pritchard has all
the drugs now.

27:55.808 --> 27:56.843
Well, that makes it
even easier.

27:56.876 --> 27:58.811
Listen, a single purchase
from Pritchard gets us

27:58.845 --> 27:59.812
the same
end results.

27:59.846 --> 28:01.814
COLBY:
Oh, check this out.

28:01.848 --> 28:03.215
Looks like we got ourselves
a listening device.

28:03.249 --> 28:04.717
Oh, yeah?

28:04.751 --> 28:05.852
What, it's not
part of the phone?

28:05.885 --> 28:07.453
Nope, definitely not.

28:07.486 --> 28:09.756
Guess that's how Pritchard
knew about the meet.

28:09.789 --> 28:13.760
And you thought Duneaux
was just being paranoid.

28:13.793 --> 28:17.096
(whispering): I accused Cam of
being the leak.

28:17.129 --> 28:20.066
Let me talk to you for a second.
Come here.

28:20.099 --> 28:22.501
Why would you think
Cam is the leak?

28:22.534 --> 28:24.170
(sigh)

28:24.203 --> 28:25.404
Liz, I cannot be
your handler,

28:25.437 --> 28:28.007
I can't keep you safe,
if I am in the dark.

28:28.040 --> 28:31.043
Okay, the day Cam and I went
to Pritchard's

28:31.077 --> 28:32.378
for our meet-and-greet,

28:32.411 --> 28:35.381
Cam left me alone for a while
with Pritchard.

28:35.414 --> 28:37.183
Things got weird.

28:37.216 --> 28:38.785
No, nothing happened.
I'm fine.

28:38.818 --> 28:40.753
It's just...

28:40.787 --> 28:41.754
(sighs)

28:41.788 --> 28:44.256
It just got scary.

28:44.290 --> 28:45.892
Well, okay,
all right, all right.

28:45.925 --> 28:48.227
Hold on--
why would he leave you alone?

28:48.260 --> 28:49.495
He was getting high.

28:49.528 --> 28:50.496
He's getting high

28:50.529 --> 28:52.799
and you didn't tell me?

28:52.832 --> 28:53.800
- David, I know.
- What are you...?

28:53.833 --> 28:54.500
I, I know I should have.

28:54.533 --> 28:56.068
(sighing):
No...

28:56.102 --> 28:57.503
And things are
even more screwed up now

28:57.536 --> 29:00.372
because I accused him
of being in Pritchard's pocket.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.875
Liz, he's an addict!

29:02.909 --> 29:04.944
I know, but we need him
to get to Pritchard.

29:04.977 --> 29:06.012
No, not a chance.

29:06.045 --> 29:07.814
I am pulling you out.

29:07.847 --> 29:09.048
That's the only way we're gonna
take Pritchard down.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.482
Okay, we can't pin
the ambush on him.

29:10.516 --> 29:12.451
We have to nail him
in the drug buy.

29:12.484 --> 29:15.121
(sighs)

29:19.859 --> 29:23.796
You really think Cam is solid
enough to go back in there?

29:23.830 --> 29:27.766
He's a risk, but I feel
like I owe him another shot.

29:30.602 --> 29:33.205
DON:
Hey, Teri.

29:33.239 --> 29:34.841
Your guy's not returning
any of our calls.

29:34.874 --> 29:35.842
What happened?

29:35.875 --> 29:37.176
Well... you know,

29:37.209 --> 29:38.945
I don't think they're really
telling us everything.

29:38.978 --> 29:39.979
Well, they never do.

29:40.012 --> 29:41.213
Listen, you know
where I stand.

29:41.247 --> 29:42.214
I didn't want
him involved

29:42.248 --> 29:43.549
with the FBI in
the first place.

29:43.582 --> 29:45.517
Yeah, well, he's involved
and now he's gone, so...

29:45.551 --> 29:48.855
So now you want me
to reach out to him.

29:48.888 --> 29:52.158
All right, how about we give you
a share of the bust?

29:52.191 --> 29:54.260
Yeah?
I'm not talking

29:54.293 --> 29:56.362
about some half-ass
press conference mention.

29:56.395 --> 29:57.596
I want full share.

29:57.629 --> 30:00.299
All right, deal.

30:04.236 --> 30:07.940
4:30, Pritchard's bungalow.

30:07.974 --> 30:08.941
Perfect.

30:08.975 --> 30:11.610
I have so many happy memories
of the place.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.612
Listen, we, we don't have
to go through with this

30:13.645 --> 30:15.081
if you don't like it.
Okay?

30:15.114 --> 30:16.883
I just won't be able to
wear a wire.

30:16.916 --> 30:17.884
You're not
the only one

30:17.917 --> 30:18.985
at risk here, you know,

30:19.018 --> 30:20.552
so if you're going
to pull out...

30:20.586 --> 30:21.553
I'm not pulling out.

30:21.587 --> 30:22.521
COLBY:
Look, guys,

30:22.554 --> 30:24.924
Pritchard's sitting on
a ton of ice right now.

30:24.957 --> 30:26.158
He's going to want this deal
to happen

30:26.192 --> 30:27.593
just as much as we do, okay?

30:27.626 --> 30:29.061
Thanks.

30:29.095 --> 30:30.396
Yeah, my only worry is Cam.

30:30.429 --> 30:31.898
GREEN:
Don't worry about Cam.

30:31.931 --> 30:33.499
We handle stuff
like this every day,

30:33.532 --> 30:36.202
so let's just get it done.

30:38.004 --> 30:39.505
Yeah, let's go.

30:42.508 --> 30:44.076
Look, what do you
want me to say, Cam?

30:44.110 --> 30:46.879
I was wrong.

30:46.913 --> 30:48.948
I'm sorry.

30:48.981 --> 30:50.216
We both
screwed up.

30:50.249 --> 30:51.483
The score's
even now.

30:51.517 --> 30:53.452
You're the one
who's still talking about it.

31:01.627 --> 31:03.029
ALAN:
Hey, I just swung

31:03.062 --> 31:04.496
by basketball practice
over at the gym.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.365
I thought you guys
were going to be there.

31:06.398 --> 31:07.900
Yeah, sorry, uh, the stuff
I'm working on for Don

31:07.934 --> 31:08.935
is kind of
at a crucial point.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.377
This ball is so much cooler
than the one they use now.

31:18.410 --> 31:19.411
Why'd they change it?

31:19.445 --> 31:20.546
No, they didn't
change it.

31:20.579 --> 31:22.548
This one belonged to the ABA.

31:22.581 --> 31:25.551
You know, Dr. J, uh,
George "Iceman" Gervin.

31:25.584 --> 31:27.920
It was a lot flashier style
of play back then.

31:27.954 --> 31:29.188
What, no party today?

31:29.221 --> 31:30.489
Hey, we could
start one.

31:30.522 --> 31:32.058
You want a drink, a line,

31:32.091 --> 31:33.392
a bump?
What do you want?

31:33.425 --> 31:34.994
Why don't we just get
to the deal?

31:35.027 --> 31:36.495
So what happened
to the ABA?

31:36.528 --> 31:38.931
Ah, it pretty much
got swallowed up by the NBA,

31:38.965 --> 31:41.033
which gave them control
over player salaries

31:41.067 --> 31:42.668
and TV rights, and all of that.

31:42.701 --> 31:45.037
Essentially, the NBA took
control of the whole market.

31:45.071 --> 31:47.373
That's what Pritchard wants.

31:47.406 --> 31:49.375
I need to call Don.

31:49.408 --> 31:51.710
What, you two have a fight
or something?

31:51.743 --> 31:53.112
CAM:
We happen to know

31:53.145 --> 31:54.280
it was you who hit Duneaux,

31:54.313 --> 31:55.948
and we were a little close
to the action.

31:55.982 --> 31:57.116
PRITCHARD:
Then you also know

31:57.149 --> 31:59.118
I have his ice.

31:59.151 --> 32:01.253
(clears throat)

32:01.287 --> 32:02.955
Turns out I, uh,

32:02.989 --> 32:06.692
I acquired some from
the Armenian, as well.

32:06.725 --> 32:07.693
CHARLIE: Don. Yeah. Pritchard
doesn't want to sell.

32:07.726 --> 32:09.061
No, you're wrong, Charlie.

32:09.095 --> 32:10.596
Liz is on her way now
to make the buy.

32:10.629 --> 32:11.697
Listen to me. He wants
to control the market,

32:11.730 --> 32:13.065
own the whole brand.

32:13.099 --> 32:14.300
I don't know
what Liz is walking into,

32:14.333 --> 32:16.302
but Pritchard does not want
to sell to her.

32:16.335 --> 32:18.270
You've got to stop her.

32:18.304 --> 32:20.339
Situation's changed.
I'm not selling anymore.

32:20.372 --> 32:23.009
Maybe you should tell me
why the hell we're here.

32:23.042 --> 32:24.710
'Cause your girlfriend
took 50 keys of ice

32:24.743 --> 32:26.478
off Paloma.

32:26.512 --> 32:28.014
I want to take 'em
off her hands.

32:28.047 --> 32:29.181
LIZ:
My people in Seattle

32:29.215 --> 32:30.349
don't want your money.

32:30.382 --> 32:31.550
They want the product.

32:31.583 --> 32:34.053
Well, that's just too bad
for them.

32:34.086 --> 32:35.387
CAM:
Screw you. We're out of here.

32:35.421 --> 32:37.156
- No you're not.
- Ow!

32:37.189 --> 32:39.291
Let go of me!

32:39.325 --> 32:41.093
(groaning)
PRITCHARD: Come on.

32:41.127 --> 32:42.628
You haven't heard my offer.

32:44.063 --> 32:45.364
(panting)

32:45.397 --> 32:47.299
(gunshot)

32:52.038 --> 32:53.105
COLBY:
Don, they've been inside

32:53.139 --> 32:54.373
going on eight minutes now.

32:54.406 --> 32:56.108
DON:
I got SWAT scrambling.

32:56.142 --> 32:58.277
I should be there in 15 with
mobile command, all right?

32:58.310 --> 32:59.645
I don't
like this.

32:59.678 --> 33:02.081
I shouldn't have let her go in.

33:02.114 --> 33:03.649
COLBY:
All right. Wait.

33:03.682 --> 33:04.750
Here they come.

33:07.153 --> 33:08.787
Where's Liz?

33:08.820 --> 33:11.190
DAVID:
And where's

33:11.223 --> 33:13.159
he going so fast?

33:15.261 --> 33:16.695
(sighs,
car alarm chirps)

33:16.728 --> 33:18.130
What is wrong
with you?!

33:18.164 --> 33:19.598
You left her alone
in there.

33:19.631 --> 33:22.268
What kind of animal after
what happened the last time?

33:22.301 --> 33:26.205
No. Pritchard gave me an hour
to go get the stuff we got

33:26.238 --> 33:28.040
from Paloma and
get back in there.

33:28.074 --> 33:29.741
(panting)

33:29.775 --> 33:32.344
Okay, what's the chance that
he is really gonna hurt her?

33:32.378 --> 33:34.713
Oh, p... Listen to me.
The best play is for me

33:34.746 --> 33:37.083
to go get the drugs
and get back in there.

33:37.116 --> 33:38.284
(panting)

33:38.317 --> 33:39.385
Come on. Look at you.

33:39.418 --> 33:40.819
You're shaking.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.188
It's not because of any hit
on the head.

33:42.221 --> 33:43.355
You are jonesing for a fix.

33:43.389 --> 33:44.790
That is because I am clean.

33:44.823 --> 33:47.226
I could have gone and
fixed up, but I didn't.

33:47.259 --> 33:50.496
But I want
what you want.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.598
Let's get Liz out of there.

33:52.631 --> 33:54.666
(panting)

34:00.472 --> 34:02.208
Even if we give him
what he wants,

34:02.241 --> 34:04.376
there's no guarantee
we get her out safely.

34:04.410 --> 34:06.112
Killing comes easy
to this guy,

34:06.145 --> 34:07.346
and we already
know that.

34:07.379 --> 34:09.281
My mistake was letting you sell
me on this from the beginning.

34:09.315 --> 34:10.516
Now, what the hell happened
to the plan?

34:10.549 --> 34:12.284
All right, Pritchard's a much
more intelligent businessman

34:12.318 --> 34:13.552
than I could
have anticipated.

34:13.585 --> 34:15.621
He's a psychopath drug dealer
with a tenth-grade education.

34:15.654 --> 34:17.623
But he's a savant when
it comes to business.

34:17.656 --> 34:18.857
He wasn't lured
by a quick profit.

34:18.890 --> 34:21.860
He knew that selling out would
ultimately dirty the brand.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.229
Charlie, we gotta do
something here.

34:23.262 --> 34:24.196
All right? Let's
just focus. David?

34:24.230 --> 34:25.364
You've got options.
You've got SWAT, HRT.

34:25.397 --> 34:26.598
Wait, wait. You're gonna just

34:26.632 --> 34:28.234
pull your guy, just take off?

34:28.267 --> 34:29.235
I can't justify

34:29.268 --> 34:30.369
sending Cam back in there.

34:30.402 --> 34:31.503
That just puts a
second agent at risk.

34:31.537 --> 34:32.804
No way I'm walking
away from this.

34:32.838 --> 34:33.872
You want me
to make that an order?

34:33.905 --> 34:35.040
- Wait, wait...
CAM: Go ahead.

34:35.073 --> 34:37.376
And lose six RICO indictments,
your trafficking cases,

34:37.409 --> 34:38.644
and every other
investigation

34:38.677 --> 34:41.280
that I have
busted my ass on for you!

34:41.313 --> 34:43.482
Go for it.hat, man? You got it.

34:43.515 --> 34:45.251
All right, all right, let's just
focus here, okay?

34:45.284 --> 34:46.518
Let's put together a plan.

34:46.552 --> 34:48.454
- SWAT's an option.
- Not the best one.

34:48.487 --> 34:49.488
DON: No, I don't know about
that, Charlie.

34:49.521 --> 34:50.889
This guy sees he's surrounded,

34:50.922 --> 34:52.691
it might be more
than he bargained for.

34:52.724 --> 34:54.393
Look, right now, we have an
unexpected asymmetric advantage

34:54.426 --> 34:55.361
over the Nash
equilibrium...

34:55.394 --> 34:56.428
- What?
- Game theory.

34:56.462 --> 34:58.330
Pritchard doesn't realize
he's dealing with us.

34:58.364 --> 35:00.332
And revealing that by
surrounding the place with SWAT

35:00.366 --> 35:01.267
is like Odysseus
telling the Trojans

35:01.300 --> 35:03.369
that their gift horse
is full of Greeks.

35:03.402 --> 35:05.304
Come on, let's go.
We're running out of time.

35:05.337 --> 35:08.440
You're making a mistake.

35:08.474 --> 35:12.311
Burning your relationship
with the people I work for.

35:12.344 --> 35:14.746
I don't need you or your people
to break into Seattle.

35:16.315 --> 35:18.284
Once I grow the market here,

35:18.317 --> 35:20.752
I'll expand.

35:20.786 --> 35:23.155
Word gets out
how you do business,

35:23.189 --> 35:24.756
no one's gonna deal with you.

35:24.790 --> 35:28.160
I'm not going
to let word get out.

35:28.194 --> 35:30.296
How the hell

35:30.329 --> 35:31.597
did Cam land someone like you?

35:31.630 --> 35:32.764
I don't understand.

35:32.798 --> 35:34.500
Is it serious?

35:34.533 --> 35:35.634
Depends.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.503
On what?

35:37.536 --> 35:39.938
If his ass gets back here
with my drugs.

35:39.971 --> 35:42.841
(chuckles)

35:42.874 --> 35:44.310
(knocking on door,
door opens)

35:48.480 --> 35:49.481
Let her go first.

35:49.515 --> 35:50.782
Um... no.

36:00.326 --> 36:02.428
It better all be here.

36:02.461 --> 36:03.929
(explosion)

36:03.962 --> 36:05.397
FBI!

36:05.431 --> 36:06.198
Hands in the air!

36:15.974 --> 36:19.211
David, I need medical!

36:19.245 --> 36:20.479
No, it's all right, it's all
right, it's all right.

36:20.512 --> 36:21.713
- What do you mean?
- It caught the vest.

36:21.747 --> 36:23.449
Are you okay?
Are you hit?

36:23.482 --> 36:24.783
No, I'm fine.

36:24.816 --> 36:27.353
(sighs)
Oh, God.

36:27.386 --> 36:28.320
You guys all right?

36:28.354 --> 36:29.921
DAVID:
We're good.

36:32.358 --> 36:36.695
* Out on this hot street,
breaking sun *

36:39.365 --> 36:44.336
* Everybody watch
as I come undone *

36:48.440 --> 36:50.409
* Oh, my God...

36:50.442 --> 36:52.678
Good job, buddy.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.780
Good job.

36:54.813 --> 36:56.782
If I had done a good
job, she wouldn't have

36:56.815 --> 36:57.883
been in there to begin with.

36:57.916 --> 36:59.451
Hey look, next time,
maybe you do things different,

36:59.485 --> 37:00.486
but she didn't get hurt.

37:00.519 --> 37:01.587
That's all I asked.

37:06.625 --> 37:08.594
What's this?

37:08.627 --> 37:11.897
Promotion's
been approved.

37:11.930 --> 37:14.400
I'm not around,
you're in charge.

37:14.433 --> 37:17.536
Oh.

37:17.569 --> 37:18.970
(laughing)
I don't know. I think it's time

37:19.004 --> 37:20.038
I started taking
some long weekends.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.373
What do you think?

37:23.008 --> 37:30.048
* Seems like the best thing
to do is cry... *

37:30.081 --> 37:31.783
Whew!

37:31.817 --> 37:35.554
* So I laid on the blacktop
and started to die... *

37:36.388 --> 37:37.523
(sighs)

37:37.556 --> 37:39.024
It's gonna be a big change.

37:39.057 --> 37:40.426
You ready?

37:40.459 --> 37:42.694
I'm a little nervous
to wear a suit again.

37:42.728 --> 37:43.895
(scoffs)

37:43.929 --> 37:45.431
That's not
what I meant.

37:45.464 --> 37:47.399
I know.

37:49.401 --> 37:53.472
* Down in the gutter where
the needle's in charge... *

37:53.505 --> 37:55.707
You're stalling.

37:55.741 --> 37:58.710
I know.
I don't want to go in there.

37:58.744 --> 38:00.679
You have to.

38:00.712 --> 38:03.415
And not just 'cause
it's regulations.

38:03.449 --> 38:05.851
Now, go. Come on,
get out of my car.

38:05.884 --> 38:09.788
* Just don't let the medicine
take care of it... *

38:09.821 --> 38:11.790
You got plans 30 days from now?

38:11.823 --> 38:12.724
I do.

38:15.361 --> 38:17.329
I'll be here.

38:17.363 --> 38:19.297
That's a good thing.

38:25.871 --> 38:27.806
Now, seriously,
go, get out.

38:32.010 --> 38:38.684
* Now watch it,
I don't wanna close my eyes... *

38:38.717 --> 38:41.620
ALAN: On an inbound pass under
your own bucket,

38:41.653 --> 38:43.855
the best way to get a man free
is to set a pick,

38:43.889 --> 38:44.823
or maybe even a double-screen

38:44.856 --> 38:46.625
like this.

38:46.658 --> 38:50.596
See?
Then... he's free.

38:50.629 --> 38:52.664
Wait. What happened
to flooding the area?

38:52.698 --> 38:53.832
Huh?

38:53.865 --> 38:55.801
You know, where you sent
all the guys into the corner?

38:55.834 --> 38:57.403
Flooding the zone.

38:57.436 --> 38:58.637
That's when you're playing
against a zone defense.

38:58.670 --> 38:59.838
But most of the teams

38:59.871 --> 39:01.773
in CalSci's division
run a man-to-man.

39:01.807 --> 39:03.074
See, uh...

39:03.108 --> 39:04.743
(laughs)

39:04.776 --> 39:06.011
You're not interested in this
at all, are you?

39:06.044 --> 39:07.679
Not really.

39:07.713 --> 39:10.048
But that doesn't mean
that I'm not having a good time.

39:10.081 --> 39:11.850
Oh, come on.
Now you're just being kind.

39:11.883 --> 39:12.684
No, I'm not.

39:12.718 --> 39:14.953
I really like
spending time with you,

39:14.986 --> 39:16.722
and we don't get
to do it very often.

39:16.755 --> 39:18.857
No. You know, we don't.

39:18.890 --> 39:20.559
Besides, you know,
I love that

39:20.592 --> 39:21.893
you and Charlie have a passion
for this game,

39:21.927 --> 39:23.795
and if I'm going to be part
of the family someday,

39:23.829 --> 39:24.996
I might as well learn it now.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.164
Don't be ridiculous.

39:26.197 --> 39:27.666
You're already part
of the family,

39:27.699 --> 39:29.401
even if Charlie
hasn't got his act together

39:29.435 --> 39:30.569
and made it official.

39:30.602 --> 39:31.870
I know. Right?

39:31.903 --> 39:33.705
What's up with that?

39:33.739 --> 39:35.641
What's up with what?

39:35.674 --> 39:37.175
Hi. Uh, nothing.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.544
Hi.

39:38.577 --> 39:39.778
What are you
guys doing?

39:39.811 --> 39:40.746
We're hanging out.

39:40.779 --> 39:42.047
Where's Charlie?

39:42.080 --> 39:43.815
I don't know.
He was here a moment ago.

39:43.849 --> 39:45.951
He went into the house
and didn't come back.

39:45.984 --> 39:47.118
All right.

39:47.152 --> 39:48.920
- Bye.
- Bye.

39:48.954 --> 39:51.923
So, what is up with that?

39:51.957 --> 39:53.625
Hey.

39:53.659 --> 39:54.760
- Hey.
- What's going on?

39:54.793 --> 39:56.828
I'm just watching
the news here.

39:56.862 --> 39:58.029
This-This

39:58.063 --> 40:01.467
story about a tunnel running
under the US-Mexican border.

40:01.500 --> 40:02.367
Customs can't
even estimate

40:02.400 --> 40:03.735
the amount of drugs
that got through.

40:03.769 --> 40:05.437
This other story

40:05.471 --> 40:07.839
about women smuggling in drugs
from Haiti.

40:07.873 --> 40:08.907
Oh, here we go...

40:08.940 --> 40:10.609
So, let's say my economic
modeling theory works.

40:10.642 --> 40:12.143
We stop the flow
of Hawaiian ice.

40:12.177 --> 40:13.311
Mm-hmm.

40:13.344 --> 40:14.946
Something else is just going
to take its place, right?

40:14.980 --> 40:16.648
What, did you think
you were gonna

40:16.682 --> 40:17.649
save the world, Charlie?

40:17.683 --> 40:19.518
Not the whole world.

40:21.620 --> 40:22.788
(sighs)

40:22.821 --> 40:24.923
Look, you know,

40:24.956 --> 40:28.794
we just got to fight
the little battles.

40:28.827 --> 40:30.462
Even if there's no shot
of winning the war?

40:30.496 --> 40:33.899
Well, things are better today
than they were yesterday, right?

40:37.168 --> 40:40.806
Look, any time you have an idea
like this, my door's wide open.

40:40.839 --> 40:41.973
Okay?

40:42.007 --> 40:43.842
Technically,
you don't have a door.

40:43.875 --> 40:44.843
You have a cubicle.

40:44.876 --> 40:46.578
I have a door.

40:46.612 --> 40:48.013
Oh, that's nice.

40:48.046 --> 40:49.815
You got to work
your way up to it.

40:49.848 --> 40:52.551
(both arguing playfully,
talking over each other)

40:52.584 --> 40:53.619
Oh...!

40:56.187 --> 41:00.859
* Just don't let the medicine
take care of it. *
