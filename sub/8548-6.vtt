HI, CARL.
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

02:05.092 --> 02:08.296
IT WAS EXHAUSTING.
I'M NOT SURE I'VE GOT STRENGTH

02:08.362 --> 02:10.198
TO KISS YOU HELLO.

02:10.264 --> 02:12.300
WELL, IT'S YOUR LOSS.

02:12.366 --> 02:14.435
I'LL PUSH MYSELF.

SCHOOL HANDOUTS

02:18.339 --> 02:19.707

IN EDDIE'S TRASH.

02:19.773 --> 02:22.543

WE NEVER KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON AT SCHOOL.

BELIEVE THIS!

I KNEW YOU'D BE UPSET
ABOUT MISSING
THE SCHOOL BAKE SALE.

02:34.522 --> 02:37.024
I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE BASKETBALL TRYOUTS.

02:37.090 --> 02:38.326
THEY'RE JUST
THREE WEEKS AWAY,

02:38.392 --> 02:40.628
AND EDWARD HASN'T
STARTED TRAINING.

02:40.694 --> 02:43.063

LIKE PLENTY OF TIME.

TO BE A STAR.

IT'S YOUR SACRED
FATHERLY DUTY

02:49.169 --> 02:50.671
TO PREPARE EDDIE
FOR BASKETBALL.

HARRIETTE, IF HE DOESN'T MAKE
THE BASKETBALL TEAM,

02:53.407 --> 02:55.175
IT COULD AFFECT
HIS WHOLE LIFE.

02:55.243 --> 02:56.944
HE'LL LOSE
HIS SELF-ESTEEM.

02:57.010 --> 03:01.215
HE MIGHT END UP ALONE,
HARRIETTE. NO WIFE, NO KIDS,

03:01.282 --> 03:04.818
EATING COLD SOUP
OUT OF A CAN,

03:04.885 --> 03:07.655
AND ALL BECAUSE
HE DIDN'T MAKE THE TEAM.

03:09.022 --> 03:12.626
DOES THIS STUFF JUST COME TO
YOU, OR DO YOU HAVE A MANUAL?

03:15.128 --> 03:16.864
HI, MOM. HI, DAD.

THAT BASKETBALL TRYOUTS

03:21.001 --> 03:22.803

03:22.870 --> 03:26.307
YEAH, I THINK
I SAW A HANDOUT
ABOUT THAT SOMEWHERE.

WELL, YOU'VE GOT
TO GET READY.

03:28.442 --> 03:29.877
YOU'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL
NOW, SON.

COMPETITION THAN LAST YEAR.

TO THE SCHOOL TO WORK YOU OUT.

CAME FROM SCHOOL.

HAS SPOKEN.

03:58.406 --> 04:01.074
EDWARD JUST COMPLETED
HIS FIRST BASKETBALL WORKOUT,

04:01.141 --> 04:04.044
AND HE IS ALREADY
LOOKING SHARP.

04:04.111 --> 04:07.247
WELL, THAT'S
THE HIGHLIGHT OF MY DAY.

SO, WHERE IS
AIR WINSLOW?

04:10.518 --> 04:12.252
HE'LL BE JUST
A MINUTE.

04:12.320 --> 04:15.589
I MADE HIM DRIBBLE HOME
BEHIND THE CAR.

04:15.656 --> 04:18.759
CARL, IS THERE ANY CHANCE
YOU'RE PUSHING EDDIE TOO HARD?

04:18.826 --> 04:20.260
OF COURSE NOT.

04:20.328 --> 04:23.431
I'M JUST HELPING
HIM TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF HIS TALENTS.

04:23.497 --> 04:25.232
HE'S GOT A GREAT TOUCH,
HARRIETTE.

04:25.299 --> 04:29.537
AND HE'S GOT THE HEIGHT.
I WASN'T BLESSED WITH HEIGHT.

04:29.603 --> 04:32.540
THAT'S OKAY, DAD.
YOU'VE GOT WIDTH.

04:35.242 --> 04:36.777
THANK YOU, SWEETHEART.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.949

ABOUT NO BALL BOUNCING
IN THIS HOUSE.

THERE'S A NEW RULE
IN EFFECT.

EAT, SLEEP, AND LIVE

04:48.288 --> 04:50.591
WITH THAT BASKETBALL.

A NAME LIKE THE PROS DO.

04:53.327 --> 04:56.730
BY THE WAY, SON,
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
A NAME FOR IT YET?

04:56.797 --> 05:00.768

TO NAME MY BASKETBALL.

GO UP AND CHANGE?

AND I'LL EVEN GIVE YOU
VACATIONS, BUT I HANDLE SPORTS.

07:19.473 --> 07:21.709
WHY, BECAUSE YOU'RE THE MAN?

07:21.775 --> 07:23.811
WELL, THE FACT THAT
YOUR FACE GROWS HAIR

07:23.877 --> 07:26.213
AND YOUR HEAD LOSES IT
DOESN'T PROVE DIDDLY.

07:31.218 --> 07:34.054

ANY GOAT CHEESE?

AND HEAT THEM UP UNTIL
THEY STOP MOVING.

FORGET THE EGGS.

SOMETHING ON THE WAY.

TAKE A REST.

A REST? YOU JUST HAD A WATER
BREAK AN HOUR AGO.

08:23.537 --> 08:27.374
YEAH, BUT YOU MADE ME
RUN IN PLACE WHILE
I WAS DRINKING.

08:27.440 --> 08:30.410
OKAY, SOMETHING EASY--
DEFENSIVE SKILLS.

TO CATCH MY BREATH.

AH-HA, OKAY, WHILE YOU'RE
SLACKING OFF

08:34.481 --> 08:37.017
SOME OTHER KID
IS BUSTING HIS TAIL
TO BE BETTER THAN YOU.

08:37.084 --> 08:40.988
BUT IT'S SATURDAY.
I WANTED TO HANG OUT
AT THE MALL.

08:41.054 --> 08:44.524
LOOK, I'M NOT UNREASONABLE.
FROM NOON TILL 2:00
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN,

OKAY, GOOD.

ALRIGHT, DAD,
THAT'S IT.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.702
I KNEW YOU'D SEE IT MY WAY, SON.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.536
NO, I MEAN THAT'S IT.
I QUIT.

08:56.604 --> 08:57.971
WELL, YOU CAN'T KNOCK OFF YET.

08:58.038 --> 09:01.474
I JUST TOLD YOU
HOW MUCH WORK WE HAVE TO DO.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.476
I'M NOT QUITTING
THE WORKOUT.

09:24.598 --> 09:29.837
YOU KNOW, THE OTHER MORNING
GOT ME ALL FIRED UP
ABOUT GOURMET COOKING AGAIN.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.840
I CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TWO
TO TASTE THESE BRIOCHE.

09:36.209 --> 09:37.811

09:37.878 --> 09:40.047
THEY LOOK JUST LIKE
BIG MUFFINS TO ME.

09:41.615 --> 09:45.452
NO, HARRIETTE,
BRIOCHES ARE MUCH
LIGHTER AND FLAKIER.

09:45.518 --> 09:49.189
THEY HAVE THIS WONDERFUL
SORT OF AIRY TEXTURE
ABOUT THEM.

IN THE KITCHEN ALL DAY.

OH, NO, MOTHER WINSLOW.
IT'S ONLY BEEN FOUR HOURS.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.670

CATCHING THE BIRD.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.946
NOW, DON'T THESE
LOOK DELICIOUS?

10:13.013 --> 10:16.884
I JUST HOPE THEY DON'T
FLOAT RIGHT UP TO THE CEILING.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.727

WAS CLOSE, RACHEL.

10:28.195 --> 10:31.198

ALMOST FLOATED AWAY.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.868
I THINK THEY GET LIGHTER
ONCE THEY COOL.

10:34.935 --> 10:37.004
ANYWAY, I BET
THEY TASTE WONDERFUL.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.807

WOULD YOU LIKE
TO GO FIRST?

10:39.873 --> 10:42.642
WHY NOT?
I'LL PROBABLY
GO FIRST ANYWAY.

FOR HIM TO MEET

11:24.284 --> 11:26.219
THAT'S RIGHT.
HE'S DUE HERE ANY MINUTE.

11:26.286 --> 11:29.957
I WENT TO DOWN TO CHICAGO
STADIUM TO PICK UP TICKETS
FOR THE BULLS GAME,

11:30.023 --> 11:31.358
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
I MET HIM.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.426
SO, WE STARTED TALKING
AND I TOLD HIM ABOUT EDWARD

11:33.493 --> 11:35.562
AND HE SAID
HE'D SPEAK WITH HIM.

11:35.628 --> 11:37.364

WHAT IS THIS?

NICE TO MEET YOU, HARRIETTE.

11:59.019 --> 12:00.553
NICE TO MEET
YOU, TOO.

12:00.620 --> 12:04.758
HARRIETTE, I'M SURE
THAT WILL WOULD ENJOY
SOME REFRESHMENTS.

12:04.825 --> 12:07.127
ME, TOO.
WHAT ARE
YOU FIXING?

12:09.562 --> 12:11.331
HARRIETTE...

12:13.867 --> 12:17.537
OKAY. BUT I'LL BE
RIGHT BACK.

12:17.604 --> 12:19.339
COME ON IN, WILL.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.775
SO IF YOU'RE STILL INTERESTED
IN BUYING MY PORSCHE,

12:21.842 --> 12:25.345
I'VE DECIDED
TO ASK 45,000.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.581
BUY A PORSCHE?

12:28.648 --> 12:31.151
OH, NO.
DID I RUIN A SURPRISE?

12:32.853 --> 12:35.122
WELL, YEAH, IN A WAY.

12:36.056 --> 12:38.458
CARL, I THINK
WE BETTER TALK.

12:38.525 --> 12:39.726
UH-HUH.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.328
EXCUSE US, WILL, WON'T YOU?

12:41.394 --> 12:43.330
SIT DOWN.
MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.866
PUT YOUR FEET UP.
DON'T EAT THAT.

12:56.844 --> 12:58.778
CARL, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU TOLD THAT MAN

12:58.846 --> 13:00.347
THAT YOU'D BUY HIS CAR.

13:00.413 --> 13:04.517
WELL, THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY
I FIGURED HE'D COME OVER.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.887
YOU MEAN,
YOU LIED TO THE MAN?

13:06.954 --> 13:09.056
LOOK, HARRIETTE, THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING HERE

13:09.122 --> 13:10.958
IS TO GET EDWARD
PLAYING BASKETBALL AGAIN NOW,

13:11.024 --> 13:14.027
AND I JUST
COULDN'T PASS UP
THIS OPPORTUNITY.

13:14.094 --> 13:17.464
CARL, YOU DRIBBLED
ONE BALL TOO MANY.

13:17.530 --> 13:18.832
EXCUSE ME.

13:18.899 --> 13:21.835
I'LL JUST
CLEAN UP LATER.

13:21.902 --> 13:24.471
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY.
IT JUST AIN'T RIGHT.

13:25.205 --> 13:26.439
WHOA!

13:30.343 --> 13:33.914
WILL "THE THRILL" MORGAN
IS IN THE LIVING ROOM.

13:33.981 --> 13:36.149
HE'S HERE
TO SEE CARL.

13:36.216 --> 13:38.351
I ALWAYS WANTED
TO MEET HIM.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.087
SO GO SAY HELLO.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.956
I CAN'T MEET A STAR
LOOKING LIKE THIS.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.592
NO, HONEY, I GOT TO GO
FIX MYSELF UP.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.329
NOW, HARRIETTE,
YOU'RE MY WIFE,

13:49.396 --> 13:52.765
AND I WANT YOU
TO STAND BEHIND ME
ON THIS.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.635
CARL, I'LL BE STANDING
SO FAR BEHIND YOU,

13:55.702 --> 13:58.471
YOU WON'T EVEN SEE ME.

14:01.574 --> 14:05.245
SORRY, WILL.
MY WIFE AND I HAD A DIFFERENCE
OF OPINION ABOUT CARS.

14:05.312 --> 14:08.548
SHE'S HOLDING OUT
FOR A ROLLS-ROYCE.

14:08.615 --> 14:12.819
SPEAKING OF ROLLS,
IS RACHEL OUT
OF THE KITCHEN YET?

14:12.886 --> 14:14.888
MAMA,
WE HAVE COMPANY.

14:14.955 --> 14:17.324
WILL, THIS IS ESTELLE WINSLOW,
MY MOTHER.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.759
MAMA, MEET
WILL "THE THRILL" MORGAN.

14:19.826 --> 14:23.130
THIS MAN NEEDS
NO INTRODUCTION.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.032
WILL "THE THRILL" MORGAN.

14:25.098 --> 14:26.699
IT'S NICE
TO MEET YOU, MRS. WINSLOW.

14:26.766 --> 14:30.137
IF YOU REALLY MEANT THAT,
YOU'D PLANT ONE RIGHT HERE.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.571
GLAD TO.

14:34.641 --> 14:38.478
I'M GONNA CALL
ALL MY GIRLFRIENDS
IN THE CANASTA GROUP.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.514
THEY'RE GOING TO DIE.
THEY'RE GOING--

14:46.253 --> 14:48.455
SO, READY
TO SEE THE CAR?

14:48.521 --> 14:50.523
UH, SURE.
YEAH.

14:50.590 --> 14:55.628
BUT YOU KNOW, WILL,
I REALLY WANT TO TAKE MY TIME
GOING OVER IT.

14:55.695 --> 14:58.165
WHOSE PORSCHE
IS OUT THERE?

14:59.366 --> 15:01.101
OH, SWEAT!

15:01.168 --> 15:02.902
YOU'RE WILL MORGAN!

15:02.970 --> 15:05.238
WILL, THIS IS
OUR SON EDDIE.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.941
NICE TO MEET YOU, EDDIE.
THAT'S MY PORSCHE OUTSIDE.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.576
BUT YOUR DAD
MIGHT BUY IT.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.078
WE'RE GONNA GET
A PORSCHE?

15:11.144 --> 15:13.646
UH...MAYBE.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.282
SAY, WILL...

15:15.348 --> 15:17.917
AHEM. YOU KNOW WHAT
REALLY CLEARS MY HEAD

15:17.985 --> 15:19.252
BEFORE A BIG DECISION?

15:19.319 --> 15:21.488
BASKETBALL.
BASKETBALL?

15:21.554 --> 15:25.158
YEAH. SURE! IT'LL BE FUN.
WE'LL GO OVER
TO THE HIGH SCHOOL.

15:25.225 --> 15:28.828
YOU WOULDN'T MIND SHOOTING
AROUND WITH A REAL PRO?

15:28.895 --> 15:30.263
NO.
GO UP AND GET FRED.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.132
IS FRED EDDIE'S
BROTHER?

15:32.199 --> 15:34.434
NO. IT'S
HIS BASKETBALL.

15:35.435 --> 15:38.171
HE NAMED IT,
JUST LIKE THE PROS DO.

15:38.238 --> 15:39.872
WHERE'D HE GET
THAT DUMB IDEA?

15:39.939 --> 15:41.674
I DON'T KNOW.

15:42.875 --> 15:44.511
YOU KNOW, CARL,
IT'S FUNNY.

15:44.577 --> 15:47.981
I'M GETTING THE FEELING
THE CAR ISN'T THE REASON
YOU ASKED ME HERE.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.583
HA! ISN'T
THE REAL REASON.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.252
OKAY, I LIED.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.921
LOOK, WILL, YOU SEE,
EDWARD QUIT BASKETBALL,

15:54.988 --> 15:58.225
AND I WAS HOPING KIND OF HOPING
MAYBE YOU'D TALK HIM
INTO PLAYING AGAIN.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.661
NO PRESSURE.
IT WOULD JUST
CHANGE HIS WHOLE LIFE.

16:03.630 --> 16:04.964
OKAY. I'LL TALK
TO HIM.

16:05.032 --> 16:07.167
GEE, THANKS.

16:07.234 --> 16:09.302
ALL SET.
LET'S DO IT.

16:16.376 --> 16:20.613
WELL, WILL MORGAN,
WHAT A SURPRI--

16:23.016 --> 16:25.418
THE THRILL IS GONE.

16:40.767 --> 16:41.834
NICE FORM, HUH?

16:41.901 --> 16:43.070
NOT BAD. NOT BAD.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.472
SAY, WILL, YOU KNOW,
AS GOOD AS EDDIE IS,

16:45.538 --> 16:47.707
HE COULD STILL USE
A FEW POINTERS FROM A REAL PRO.

16:47.774 --> 16:49.909
WOULD YOU MIND SHOWING HIM
YOUR FAMOUS FIRST STEP?

16:49.976 --> 16:50.910
NO PROBLEM.

16:50.977 --> 16:52.011
HEY, EDWARD!
COME HERE.

16:52.079 --> 16:53.780
WILL'S GOING TO SHOW
YOU SOMETHING.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.282
I'LL PLAY DEFENSE.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.050
OF COURSE,
I SHOULD MENTION THAT

16:57.117 --> 17:00.320
I USED TO BE
A PRETTY FIERCE
DEFENDER BACK IN MY DAY.

17:00.387 --> 17:01.588
THANKS FOR THE WARNING.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.523
OKAY. GO AHEAD.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.561
OOH! TOE CRAMP!
OOH! AH!

17:10.330 --> 17:14.201
LISTEN, CARL,
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
TALK TO EDDIE ALONE, OKAY?

17:14.267 --> 17:15.735
YOU DON'T NEED ME
FOR ANYTHING?

17:15.802 --> 17:18.037
NO. I THINK WE'LL BE OKAY.
JUST THE TWO OF US.

17:18.105 --> 17:20.607
OH, OH.
OKAY. FINE.

17:20.673 --> 17:23.943
WELL, I GUESS I'LL SEE YOU TWO
BACK AT THE HOUSE.

17:24.010 --> 17:26.179
OH, HI!

17:28.681 --> 17:30.750
HE'S GOOD, EDDIE.

17:34.121 --> 17:36.022
HARRIETTE,
THIS IS GREAT.

17:36.089 --> 17:38.325
THEY'VE BEEN GONE
FOR OVER AN HOUR.

17:38.391 --> 17:41.060
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU GOT A HUNCH
ABOUT SOMETHING AND IT PAYS OFF,

17:41.128 --> 17:42.962
YOU JUST
FEELS SO GOOD.

17:43.029 --> 17:46.366
AM I A GREAT DAD
OR WHAT?

17:46.433 --> 17:49.736
CAREFUL YOU DON'T PULL A MUSCLE
PATTING YOURSELF ON THE BACK.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.206
OH, OH, OH,
LOOK WHO'S BACK.

17:53.273 --> 17:54.507
DID YOU TWO
HAVE FUN?

17:54.574 --> 17:56.809
YES, WE DID.
EDDIE'S A GREAT KID

17:56.876 --> 17:58.178
AND A GOOD
BALL PLAYER.

17:58.245 --> 18:00.613
I COACHED HIM.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.215
WELL, I BETTER BE GOING.

18:02.282 --> 18:05.051
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT ABOUT THE PORSCHE?

18:05.118 --> 18:06.819
OH, UM...

18:06.886 --> 18:10.690
WILL, I DON'T THINK
I WANT A RED CAR.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.025
COPS ARE ALWAYS
ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THEM.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.195
TELL ME ABOUT IT.
NICE MEETING YOU ALL.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.464
EDDIE, GOOD LUCK.

18:17.530 --> 18:20.032
IT WAS NICE
TO MEET YOU,
MR. MORGAN.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.335
THANKS, THRILL.
BYE-BYE.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.638
SO, SON...

18:25.705 --> 18:28.508
DID YOU TWO TALK
ABOUT ANYTHING
IN PARTICULAR?

18:28.575 --> 18:31.010
WELL...MAINLY
BASKETBALL.

18:31.077 --> 18:32.979
OH, BASKETBALL.

18:33.045 --> 18:35.915
WELL, UM, DID WILL SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT

18:35.982 --> 18:37.584
HOW MUCH
HE LOVES THE GAME,

18:37.650 --> 18:39.552
ALL IT'S DONE FOR HIM,
THAT SORT OF THING?

18:39.619 --> 18:42.822
OH, YEAH.
WILL SAID BASKETBALL
WAS THE GREATEST THING

18:42.889 --> 18:45.225
THAT'S EVER
HAPPENED TO HIM.

18:45.292 --> 18:47.260
WHAT SAY YOU AND I GET BACK
ON THE COURT TOMORROW

18:47.327 --> 18:49.962
AND PICK UP PRACTICE WHERE WE
LEFT OFF? WHAT DO YOU SAY?

18:50.029 --> 18:51.664
DAD, I'M STILL
NOT PLAYING.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.065
WHAT?

18:53.132 --> 18:55.302
WILL ALSO SAID
TO MAKE UP
MY OWN MIND

18:55.368 --> 18:57.337
AND TO DO WHAT
MAKES ME HAPPY.

18:57.404 --> 19:01.140
SO I'VE DECIDED
I'M HAPPY NOT
PLAYING BASKETBALL.

19:03.510 --> 19:06.012
YOU KNOW, DAD,
I WAS THAT CLOSE

19:06.078 --> 19:08.281
TO GOING BACK
TO BASKETBALL.

19:08.348 --> 19:10.583
THEN YOU HAD ME
TALK TO WILL.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.585
THANKS, DAD.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.670
I WOULD PLAY YOU
A LITTLE ONE-ON-ONE,

20:03.736 --> 20:07.907
EXCEPT KICKING YOUR BUTT
WOULD ONLY ADD
TO YOUR MISERY.

20:11.344 --> 20:14.481
HARRIETTE,
EDDIE HAD EVERYTHING
GOING FOR HIM.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.849
HOW COULD HE JUST
THROW IT AWAY?

20:16.916 --> 20:21.388
MAYBE HE DIDN'T THROW IT AWAY.
HE JUST PUT IT ASIDE
FOR A WHILE.

20:21.454 --> 20:24.724
HE DOESN'T WANNA PLAY NOW.
THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO TO CHANGE HIM.

20:24.791 --> 20:27.327
BUT I WASN'T TRYING
TO CHANGE HIM.

20:27.394 --> 20:30.129
I JUST WANTED
TO INSPIRE HIM.

20:30.196 --> 20:33.966
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
I COULD HAVE DONE
WITH THAT BOY'S TALENT?

20:34.033 --> 20:36.803
CARL, I'VE BEEN THINKING.

20:36.869 --> 20:39.839
MAYBE YOU'RE TRYING
TO LIVE YOUR OWN
FANTASY THROUGH EDDIE.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.210
WELL, MAYBE I WAS.

20:44.277 --> 20:45.978
A LITTLE.

20:46.045 --> 20:49.382
HONEY, IT'S JUST THAT
WHEN YOU DO WELL
IN SPORTS,

20:49.449 --> 20:53.252
IT CAN JUST
MAKE YOU FEEL
SO GREAT.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.154
I WANTED
THAT FOR EDDIE.

20:55.221 --> 20:56.923
I'LL TELL YOU
ONE THING, CARL.

20:56.989 --> 21:01.428
HE'S A LOT HAPPIER NOW
THAN WHEN HE WAS
DOING YOUR WORKOUTS.

21:01.494 --> 21:02.695
YOU NOTICED THAT, TOO.

21:02.762 --> 21:03.763
MM-HMM.

21:03.830 --> 21:07.300
THE ONLY PERSON WHO'S
NOT HAPPY NOW IS YOU.

21:09.235 --> 21:10.937
YEAH.

21:23.249 --> 21:26.753
YOU BETTER NOT LET
YOUR MOTHER CATCH YOU
EATING OUT OF THE CARTON.

21:26.819 --> 21:29.922
DON'T WORRY, DAD.
I'M GONNA FINISH IT ALL.

21:32.359 --> 21:35.995
YOU KNOW, SON,
I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.

21:36.062 --> 21:37.364
FOR WHAT, DAD?

21:37.430 --> 21:40.500
WELL, FOR PUSHING YOU
ABOUT BASKETBALL.

21:41.968 --> 21:44.036
IT'S ALRIGHT, DAD.

21:44.103 --> 21:45.772
MAYBE I'LL PLAY
NEXT YEAR.

21:45.838 --> 21:47.173
FAIR ENOUGH.

21:47.239 --> 21:50.977
I GUESS YOUR OLD DAD
WENT A LITTLE CRAZY, HUH?

21:51.043 --> 21:52.612
WELL, YEAH.

21:55.415 --> 21:57.016
YOU KNOW, SON...

21:58.451 --> 21:59.752
I'VE ALWAYS
HAD THIS DREAM

21:59.819 --> 22:05.625
THAT YOU'D BE
A PROFESSIONAL
BASKETBALL PLAYER.

22:05.692 --> 22:08.661
BUT I GUESS THAT WAS
MY DREAM, AND NOT YOURS.

22:08.728 --> 22:12.264
I SHOULDN'T HAVE FORCED IT
ON YOU, SON, AND I'M SORRY.

22:12.331 --> 22:15.201
DAD, IF I DON'T HAVE
MY OWN DREAM YET,

22:15.267 --> 22:17.069
IS THERE SOMETHING
WRONG WITH ME?

22:17.136 --> 22:19.439
NO. NOT AT ALL.

22:19.506 --> 22:22.241
YOU WILL SOMEDAY.
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND NOW?

22:22.308 --> 22:24.310
WHAT DO YOU LIKE
TO THINK ABOUT?

22:24.377 --> 22:25.812
GIRLS MOSTLY.

22:28.247 --> 22:30.383
WELL, THAT'S NORMAL.
WHAT ELSE?

22:30.450 --> 22:32.318
I THINK ABOUT
THE MOVIES A LOT.

22:32.385 --> 22:35.287
HEY, MAYBE YOU'LL BE
A FAMOUS MOVIE DIRECTOR,

22:35.354 --> 22:36.856
WIN THE ACADEMY AWARD.

22:36.923 --> 22:38.725
NO. I MEAN,
I LIKE TO THINK ABOUT

22:38.791 --> 22:41.394
TAKING GIRLS
TO THE MOVIES A LOT.

22:43.396 --> 22:45.398
OF COURSE.

22:45.465 --> 22:47.333
BUT ANYWAY, SON,

22:47.400 --> 22:49.602
THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING ABOUT A DREAM

22:49.669 --> 22:51.704
ISN'T WHEN
YOU FIND IT.

22:51.771 --> 22:55.341
IT'S ONCE THAT YOU DO,
YOU NEVER GIVE UP ON IT.

22:55.408 --> 22:56.809
YOU UNDERSTAND?

22:57.410 --> 22:59.512
YEAH, DAD.

22:59.579 --> 23:01.614
AND, SON...

23:01.681 --> 23:04.183
WHENEVER YOU FIND
THAT DREAM,

23:04.250 --> 23:06.486
IF YOU EVER
NEED ANY HELP,

23:06.553 --> 23:08.988
I'LL ALWAYS
BE THERE.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.490
THANKS, DAD.

23:13.092 --> 23:14.761
OH, EDDIE!

23:15.628 --> 23:17.864
HEY, THIS IS
PRETTY GOOD.
