That's a lot of blood.

10:30.718 --> 10:32.294
Taylor might be hiding an affair,

Not me. But maybe Rosie.

Hold on. Whoever killed Louie Becker

11:25.878 --> 11:27.298

11:27.328 --> 11:28.094
Mm-hmm.

have done that by herself.

she was having an affair.

11:32.860 --> 11:37.030
Marisol, you've got to find
out who she was sleeping with.

You said she's one of your best friends.

11:38.229 --> 11:40.394
How would you get it out of one of us?

11:40.563 --> 11:42.288
I would take you out,

ply you with alcohol until you opened up.

11:44.630 --> 11:45.879
You hear that, Rosie?

11:45.881 --> 11:47.497
Don't go to a bar with Marisol.

11:47.499 --> 11:49.216
It won't end well for you.

there's not enough bourbon in the world.

12:03.626 --> 12:04.953
Deion's father?

12:05.882 --> 12:08.107
Apparently, he didn't
even know Deion existed.

12:08.137 --> 12:10.228
- How does that happen?
- A one-night stand.

12:10.258 --> 12:11.972
The mother never told
him, she gave up the child,

12:11.974 --> 12:14.363
then promptly dropped dead.

12:14.843 --> 12:16.760
Fortunately, the father
doesn't want to take the boy.

12:16.762 --> 12:18.478
He and his wife already have children.

12:25.537 --> 12:26.875
So, have him over.

12:26.905 --> 12:28.161
Are you insane?

12:28.991 --> 12:30.496
Evelyn will be furious when she finds out

12:30.526 --> 12:32.859
I'm the one who tracked him down.

Mm-hmm.

12:39.210 --> 12:40.400
What are you reading?

12:40.569 --> 12:42.035
A casting magazine.

12:42.336 --> 12:44.037
My music career is in the toilet,

12:44.039 --> 12:46.162
so I'm trying to be an actress.

It's just annoying.

I hate to point this

No, no, no, no. You just think you do.

Zoila never took me hostage.

13:36.278 --> 13:39.676

was a very negative person.

Well, I definitely owe Joy an apology,
