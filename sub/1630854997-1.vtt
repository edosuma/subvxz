WEBVTT

00:11.228 --> 00:12.795
Woman: I mean, it was
all so last minute,

00:12.882 --> 00:14.971
but she had nowhere to go,
so of course, I offered.

00:15.058 --> 00:16.799
What happened?

00:16.886 --> 00:18.540
Her and her boyfriend
got into this big fight.

00:18.670 --> 00:21.891
You know, Rex. And he
kicked her out.

00:22.022 --> 00:25.895
Men. So I guess she'll
be here for a while, hey?

00:26.026 --> 00:28.332
Well, until the baby
comes, at least,

00:28.463 --> 00:30.421
and she gets back on
her feet again.

00:30.508 --> 00:33.294
You have always been such
a good friend to her.

00:33.381 --> 00:35.122
Well, she was good
to me in high school,

00:35.209 --> 00:37.211
and besides, we have the room.
And she's been so helpful

00:37.341 --> 00:39.213
- with Tanner.
- Oh, good.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.476
Oh, hi. Speak of the
devil.

00:41.606 --> 00:42.868
How you feeling, Joslyn?

00:42.955 --> 00:44.392
- Oh, not bad, Dolly.
- Oh.

00:44.522 --> 00:46.394
Just taking it
one day at a time.

00:46.524 --> 00:47.438
I brought these
out for the kids.

00:47.569 --> 00:49.266
Thank you.

00:49.397 --> 00:52.182
Well, you look like you're
just about ready to pop.

00:52.313 --> 00:54.445
Yeah. Yeah. It's
getting close.

00:54.532 --> 00:56.404
Is it a boy or
a girl?

00:56.491 --> 00:58.971
- I'll be right back.
- I'm keeping that a surprise.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.756
Man:
Yeah, the property is huge,

01:00.886 --> 01:02.627
and we've got some serious
interest from Asia.

01:02.758 --> 01:05.543
Just putting the pieces
of the deal together now.

01:05.630 --> 01:07.632
Hey, honey! Sorry
to interrupt.

01:07.763 --> 01:09.504
Um, table's all set.
Are the burgers almost done?

01:09.591 --> 01:11.419
There's my baby.

01:11.549 --> 01:13.073
Mm. We are firing on
all cylinders.

01:13.203 --> 01:14.378
I just need some
cheese.

01:14.509 --> 01:16.250
You read my mind.

01:16.380 --> 01:17.773
Just only put it
on half of it, alright?

01:17.860 --> 01:19.426
- I'll go get Tanner.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:22.125 --> 01:24.214
Sounds like I should
get into real estate, Mike.

01:24.345 --> 01:26.216
- Make some better coin.
- Ah, I don't know, Bill.

01:26.347 --> 01:27.957
You got to
work it 24/7.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.263
I've been doing it
for five years,

01:29.393 --> 01:30.960
and it's just starting
to heat up now.

01:32.353 --> 01:34.268
Paige:
Tanner! Food's ready.

01:36.096 --> 01:40.622
Hey! Hey, hey,
what's wrong, buddy?

01:40.752 --> 01:43.755
Asher won't let me play
with them. He's mean.

01:43.842 --> 01:47.846
Oh. What does Teddy
have to say about it?

01:47.977 --> 01:50.806
Teddy: Don't worry. I'll
be your best friend.

01:50.936 --> 01:53.852
And remember, always
be a brave bear.

01:53.983 --> 01:57.073
See? You always have Teddy
to play with, don't you?

01:57.160 --> 01:58.814
Alright. Let's go
get some food,

01:58.944 --> 02:01.382
and then maybe we can
play Hide and Seek after?

02:01.512 --> 02:02.905
Yeah? Okay. Great.

02:05.560 --> 02:08.650
- Tanner: Daddy!
- Ah, hey! There's my boy!

02:08.737 --> 02:11.305
Come
here. Oh, son,

02:11.392 --> 02:13.394
you get better looking every
day, don't you?

02:13.524 --> 02:15.396
Hey, Tanner,

02:15.483 --> 02:17.659
why don't you show these boys
our birthmark, huh?

02:17.789 --> 02:21.358
Isn't
that wild? We all got it.

02:21.445 --> 02:24.753
Look at this. Got that
from my dad, my granddad.

02:24.883 --> 02:27.364
You can always tell a Johnson
boy, because we all got it.

02:27.495 --> 02:29.845
- Ain't that right?
- Okay, men,

02:29.975 --> 02:31.716
enough showing off.

02:31.803 --> 02:33.892
Come on. The food's
getting cold.

02:33.978 --> 02:36.591
Michael: That's right. Let's
eat. You want a hot dog?

02:36.721 --> 02:38.941
You look so
happy, Paige.

02:39.071 --> 02:40.551
It's wonderful
to see.

02:40.638 --> 02:42.031
I really am.

02:43.424 --> 02:44.599
Thanks for
letting me stay.

02:46.209 --> 02:47.297
I wouldn't have
you anywhere else.

02:51.345 --> 02:53.042
Lovely party, darling.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.522
Great food.

02:54.609 --> 02:55.740
- It's the salads.
- Oh.

02:55.871 --> 02:57.525
They are always a hit.

02:57.655 --> 02:59.135
I love you. I'll
see you next week.

02:59.222 --> 03:00.789
See you next
week, darling.

03:00.919 --> 03:04.314
Boys! Mwah! Mwah!

03:04.445 --> 03:05.707
You're the
best, Grandma!

03:05.837 --> 03:09.014
Oh, stop it, you
old charmer.

03:09.101 --> 03:11.713
- Bye.
- Bye.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.193
- Hi. Thanks.
- Michael: Hey, come on.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.977
You guys don't want
to take us Johnson on?

03:15.064 --> 03:16.892
Nah, everyone's beat.

03:16.978 --> 03:18.285
Some other time.

03:18.415 --> 03:20.417
Come on, kids.

03:20.504 --> 03:22.289
Thanks for coming.

03:22.419 --> 03:23.725
- Michael: You see, Tanner?
- Paige: Thank you.

03:23.855 --> 03:25.814
Most people
lack stamina.

03:25.944 --> 03:27.816
They're not willing to go the
extra mile to succeed,

03:27.903 --> 03:30.471
but not us. You're going
to grow up to be a winner,

03:30.558 --> 03:31.820
just like your
dad. Right, buddy?

03:31.907 --> 03:33.952
Yeah!

03:34.083 --> 03:36.216
Hey. There's a little more
to do out here,

03:36.346 --> 03:38.130
but I'll finish
up washing up inside.

03:38.261 --> 03:39.393
Thank you, Joslyn.

03:43.918 --> 03:45.964
Well, I think that
was a success.

03:46.095 --> 03:48.053
You did
great, babe.

03:51.055 --> 03:52.579
Oh.

03:54.277 --> 03:56.975
Whoa. Whoa. Slow down.

03:57.106 --> 03:58.890
Slow down? Me?

04:01.632 --> 04:03.068
I got to hit
the can.

04:03.199 --> 04:05.157
Help Mom with the
dishes, okay, buddy?

04:05.245 --> 04:07.769
No. You--

04:07.899 --> 04:09.292
It's okay, sweetie.
I'll do it.

04:09.423 --> 04:11.163
Why don't you go
get ready for bed, okay?

04:11.251 --> 04:12.774
Will you and Daddy
read me a story?

04:12.861 --> 04:14.776
Of course. Go.

04:30.618 --> 04:32.794
Jos, do you know where the
garbage bags are?

04:35.449 --> 04:36.537
Jos?

04:42.717 --> 04:44.153
Michael: Look. I don't know
what the heck you think

04:44.240 --> 04:45.850
you're doing here, but I
want you out of here.

04:45.981 --> 04:47.504
You are not going
to mess this up for me.

04:47.591 --> 04:50.072
You can't be here.

04:50.159 --> 04:51.421
Tomorrow, I want you
out of here!

04:51.552 --> 04:53.423
Paige:
Guys, what's going on?

04:56.207 --> 04:57.993
Michael:
Nothing.

04:58.123 --> 04:59.647
Doesn't look like
nothing. She's upset.

05:03.825 --> 05:06.088
I don't know why you
brought her here.

05:06.218 --> 05:08.699
Because she's my best friend
and has nowhere to go,

05:08.830 --> 05:10.440
especially with the
baby coming.

05:10.571 --> 05:12.486
How is that our
problem?

05:12.573 --> 05:14.009
What's the issue?

05:14.139 --> 05:15.837
She helps out around
the house. I mean,

05:15.924 --> 05:17.665
you're never
home anymore with work.

05:17.795 --> 05:20.624
I... I like
having her here.

05:20.711 --> 05:23.758
Seriously? She had to have done
something to get kicked out.

05:23.888 --> 05:25.150
I don't trust her.

05:25.237 --> 05:26.326
Okay? I don't trust
her with Tanner.

05:26.413 --> 05:27.501
You should have
talked to me first.

05:29.154 --> 05:31.069
Well... she's like
a sister to me.

05:31.156 --> 05:32.810
I-- I didn't think
you would mind.

05:32.941 --> 05:35.291
Whatever.

05:35.378 --> 05:37.075
W-Wait. Where are
you going?

05:37.162 --> 05:38.512
I'm going to Lucy's.

05:38.599 --> 05:40.731
A bar, Michael?
Really?

05:40.862 --> 05:43.952
- I have a meeting.
- Now?

05:44.082 --> 05:45.997
These meetings pay
for this house, your car,

05:46.084 --> 05:47.738
put food
on the table.

05:47.869 --> 05:50.524
You're-- you're never home
anymore, and I just--

05:50.654 --> 05:52.700
It's Sunday. You've
been drinking.

05:53.962 --> 05:55.355
Excuse me?

05:56.617 --> 05:59.489
My clients love me, Paige.

05:59.576 --> 06:01.665
They call, I go. That's the gig.

06:01.752 --> 06:03.928
You don't like it, why
don't you get a job?

06:04.059 --> 06:05.060
Then we can talk.

06:36.091 --> 06:38.310
Daddy, Daddy!

06:38.398 --> 06:41.096
Michael: Oh, hey, look
at this handsome fella, huh?

06:41.183 --> 06:43.881
Tanner, why don't you go get
ready for school, okay?

06:44.012 --> 06:46.014
Be at the door
in five minutes.

06:55.632 --> 06:57.852
Must have
been some meeting.

06:57.982 --> 06:59.201
Paige, I'm sorry.

06:59.331 --> 07:01.464
Yeah?

07:01.551 --> 07:05.294
For what? For what
you said to me last night?

07:05.381 --> 07:07.601
Or for coming
home reeking of booze?

07:07.688 --> 07:08.906
I said I'm sorry.

07:09.037 --> 07:10.952
Paige:
What's going on, Mike?

07:11.082 --> 07:12.388
This is-- this
is starting to feel

07:12.519 --> 07:14.085
like more
than just business.

07:14.172 --> 07:17.524
It... feels like you
don't want to be here.

07:17.654 --> 07:19.308
Not now, babe.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.049
Well, what were you
doing all night?

07:21.179 --> 07:23.225
Don't question me, Paige, okay?
I said I was sorry.

07:23.355 --> 07:25.880
- Excuse me?
- I told you not to question me!

07:30.493 --> 07:31.929
Let's go, buddy.

07:42.549 --> 07:45.159
Paige:
Don't worry about Daddy.

07:45.247 --> 07:47.336
You're going to have a great
day today, sweetie, okay?

07:47.467 --> 07:48.816
Alright. I'll pick
you up after school.

07:48.946 --> 07:50.165
Love you!

07:50.252 --> 07:50.948
Woman:
Alright. Have fun.

07:59.391 --> 08:00.654
Dolly:
Hello?

08:00.784 --> 08:02.960
- Hi, Mom.
- Dolly: Hi, darling.

08:03.091 --> 08:05.006
Is something wrong?

08:05.136 --> 08:07.965
Yeah. I-- I don't know
what to do.

08:46.090 --> 08:47.352
Hey.

08:49.746 --> 08:52.270
What's going on, Jos?

08:52.357 --> 08:54.577
Paige, I don't want to cause
problems in your home.

08:54.708 --> 08:56.579
What problems, Jos?

08:56.710 --> 08:58.276
- I can just go.
- No! Just tell me

08:58.407 --> 09:00.104
what you
were talking about.

09:00.235 --> 09:01.671
I feel like I'm the
only person who doesn't know

09:01.758 --> 09:03.064
what's going
on in my home!

09:03.194 --> 09:04.805
No, you're
not leaving!

09:04.892 --> 09:08.286
Tell me what that was
all about, please!

09:08.373 --> 09:10.550
- Paige, I don't--
- What was he saying to you?

09:10.637 --> 09:12.943
Ah!

09:13.030 --> 09:14.902
Jos?

09:15.032 --> 09:16.556
Okay. Okay. No,
no, no. It's okay.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.732
I think the baby
might be coming, okay?

09:18.819 --> 09:20.472
No, no. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.040
- Ah!
- Okay. Okay. Can you walk?

09:23.171 --> 09:24.999
Yeah. Okay. Okay. We're
going to go to the hospital.

09:25.086 --> 09:26.348
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:30.308 --> 09:33.529
Hey, Mom. Can you pick up
Tanner from school

09:33.660 --> 09:36.053
and give him
dinner at home?

09:36.140 --> 09:37.881
Yeah. No. I have no
idea where Michael is.

09:38.012 --> 09:40.971
He's not answering
his phone.

09:41.102 --> 09:42.930
I just don't want her to go
through this alone.

09:44.105 --> 09:45.410
Mrs. Johnson?

09:45.497 --> 09:48.239
Oh. Mom, I'll call
you back, okay?

09:48.326 --> 09:50.111
Hey. Is everything alright?

09:50.198 --> 09:51.895
Yeah. Joslyn's still
in labor.

09:52.026 --> 09:53.505
Uh, is the
father here?

09:53.636 --> 09:57.771
No. No. Um, uh, for
all intents and purposes...

09:57.901 --> 10:00.034
- I am the father.
- Okay.

10:00.164 --> 10:03.211
Has, uh-- has Joslyn been
under a lot of stress lately?

10:03.298 --> 10:05.561
Yeah. You could--
you could say that. Yeah.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.563
The baby's a
little premature,

10:07.694 --> 10:09.913
but we are monitoring them
both carefully.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.959
There is no
need to worry.

10:12.089 --> 10:13.134
She did ask
if you could wait.

10:13.264 --> 10:14.526
Yes. Yes.

10:14.657 --> 10:16.224
Okay. I guess...

10:28.410 --> 10:30.760
Hey, Mom.
You with Tanner?

10:30.891 --> 10:32.457
Dolly:
I just got him into bed.

10:32.588 --> 10:34.415
I got to call you back.

10:34.503 --> 10:36.418
- Dolly: How is she?
- Joslyn did great.

10:36.548 --> 10:37.811
She had a beautiful
baby boy.

10:37.898 --> 10:38.986
Ah.

10:39.116 --> 10:41.510
A boy, huh?

10:41.597 --> 10:43.164
Yeah. It was long,

10:43.251 --> 10:44.992
but she did pretty
well, thank goodness.

10:45.122 --> 10:47.081
They're both sleeping now.

10:47.211 --> 10:48.343
You coming home, then?

10:51.259 --> 10:52.434
They need to keep her

10:52.521 --> 10:53.653
for observation for
a few days,

10:53.783 --> 10:54.958
so I'm going to stay here,

10:55.045 --> 10:56.612
just in case she needs anything.

10:56.699 --> 10:58.353
Dolly:
That's fine, Paige.

10:58.483 --> 10:59.963
I'll take care of things
around the house,

11:00.094 --> 11:01.617
and I'll get
Tanner to school.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.880
You just stay as
long you need.

11:04.011 --> 11:06.491
Thanks, Dolly, but I
think I can handle it.

11:06.578 --> 11:07.841
Where were you today
when I called?

11:07.971 --> 11:09.886
Mom had to go
pick up Tanner.

11:10.017 --> 11:12.236
- I was working.
- So you turn your phone off?

11:12.367 --> 11:14.456
Dolly: Um, it's alright, Paige.
We've handled it.

11:14.543 --> 11:16.632
So, they're coming back
with you, are they?

11:16.719 --> 11:17.851
Where would you like them
to go, Michael?

11:17.938 --> 11:19.679
Back to her ex's
would be a good start.

11:19.766 --> 11:21.202
Well, that's not happening.

11:21.332 --> 11:22.246
Dolly: Now, you two,
that's enough.

11:22.377 --> 11:24.205
Uh, Paige,

11:24.292 --> 11:27.382
I'll bring by your clothes and
things tomorrow, okay?

11:27.512 --> 11:29.732
Thanks, Mom.

11:49.491 --> 11:51.232
Look at
the little baby.

11:51.319 --> 11:53.016
- Momma, Momma!
- Hi, buddy!

11:53.103 --> 11:56.803
Oh! Oh, I missed
you so much.

11:56.933 --> 11:59.066
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I want to see the baby.

11:59.196 --> 12:00.632
Paige: Yeah. Okay. You
have to be quiet, though,

12:00.720 --> 12:02.504
Tanner, okay? He's sleeping.

12:06.595 --> 12:09.293
Okay. Just give them
some space, okay?

12:09.424 --> 12:12.427
Auntie Joslyn is
tired. She needs rest.

12:12.514 --> 12:15.212
Mike: Tanner, let's go
throw the ball out back.

12:15.299 --> 12:16.561
Tanner:
Yay!

12:22.089 --> 12:23.699
Oh. I'll take this.

12:23.786 --> 12:25.440
Go get settled in.

12:25.527 --> 12:26.615
I'll get the rest of
the stuff from the car.

12:42.500 --> 12:46.287
Oh. He's perfect.

12:46.374 --> 12:48.768
Joslyn: He's the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen

12:48.855 --> 12:50.421
and by far the best
thing I've ever done.

12:52.467 --> 12:55.035
I want to give him
the life I never had.

12:55.122 --> 12:57.124
You're going to be
a wonderful mom, Jos.

12:59.126 --> 13:01.563
I'm scared.

13:01.650 --> 13:04.087
I don't have anything, Paige!

13:04.218 --> 13:07.003
When Rex kicked me out, I
took a suitcase, and I left.

13:07.090 --> 13:09.571
I maxed all my
cards out on motels.

13:09.701 --> 13:11.791
I have nothing.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.531
I need to get a job,
find us a home.

13:13.618 --> 13:16.970
No, no. Don't worry about
that right now, okay?

13:17.057 --> 13:18.362
We always thought we
would have another kid,

13:18.493 --> 13:20.147
so we kept all of
Tanner's baby stuff.

13:20.234 --> 13:22.758
So you're fine for
a little while, okay?

13:22.845 --> 13:26.631
For now, just focus
on this moment

13:26.762 --> 13:28.938
and enjoying this
beautiful baby boy.

13:29.025 --> 13:30.287
Have you decided

13:30.418 --> 13:32.115
what you want
to name him yet?

13:32.246 --> 13:33.290
Sean.

13:33.421 --> 13:36.076
- After my dad.
- Oh, Sean.

13:36.163 --> 13:37.381
Hi, Sean.

13:39.993 --> 13:41.951
Okay. You need rest.

13:42.082 --> 13:44.127
I'll be right upstairs.
If you need anything,

13:44.214 --> 13:45.476
just call, okay?

13:56.139 --> 13:59.534
Michael:
Oh, he's got me tackled! Oh!

13:59.621 --> 14:01.405
You got me
good, buddy.

14:07.063 --> 14:09.239
I want her
out of the house.

14:09.370 --> 14:10.284
What?

14:10.371 --> 14:12.242
I want her gone.

14:12.373 --> 14:14.157
We can't just kick her
out on the street.

14:14.288 --> 14:15.289
Well, I've
had enough, Paige.

14:15.419 --> 14:17.247
We can't afford this.

14:17.378 --> 14:18.945
I let you two play
house around here for a while,

14:19.032 --> 14:20.990
but now that the baby's
here, we're done.

14:21.077 --> 14:23.166
- No.
- Excuse me?

14:23.253 --> 14:25.255
She has a newborn, Mike.

14:25.342 --> 14:27.170
No family. I'm
all that she has.

14:27.301 --> 14:29.433
I-- I can't just
kick her out.

14:29.564 --> 14:31.305
You know, ever since
that leech moved in here,

14:31.435 --> 14:33.307
you been talking
back to me.

14:33.437 --> 14:35.396
Now, I'm starting to feel
like all this hard work I do

14:35.526 --> 14:37.615
for this family
is going unnoticed

14:37.746 --> 14:39.617
while you two ladies
are chowing down on my food

14:39.704 --> 14:41.402
- while I pay the bills.
- Okay. Okay. Okay. Just...

14:42.490 --> 14:43.752
I'm sorry.

14:46.059 --> 14:48.235
Let's just give her
some notice.

14:48.365 --> 14:49.584
Can she have until
the end of the week?

14:52.456 --> 14:53.501
Don't test my patience, Paige.

14:58.898 --> 15:02.727
Hey, come here,
buddy!

15:14.565 --> 15:16.132
Hey, hon.

15:16.219 --> 15:18.178
Oh, are--
are you alright?

15:18.308 --> 15:20.484
Oh, baby! Oh.

15:20.571 --> 15:22.922
Come on. Let's
get you some tea.

15:26.316 --> 15:28.318
Ugh. I don't know.

15:28.405 --> 15:29.667
Something
is wrong, Mom.

15:29.754 --> 15:31.713
I mean, Michael is
not himself.

15:31.843 --> 15:33.802
He's always at work. I
mean, he's distant.

15:33.889 --> 15:35.412
He's totally disconnected.

15:37.066 --> 15:38.502
Have you talked to
him about it?

15:38.589 --> 15:40.504
Yes, and every time I
do, he just lashes out!

15:40.635 --> 15:42.550
I've never seen
him get so angry.

15:42.637 --> 15:45.031
Paige, he hasn't gotten
physical, has he?

15:45.118 --> 15:46.597
No, no.

15:46.728 --> 15:50.253
No, but
I'm scared, Mom.

15:50.340 --> 15:52.299
Our home just doesn't feel
the same anymore.

15:54.779 --> 15:58.305
You think he's
having an affair?

15:58.392 --> 16:01.569
I mean... he goes
out a lot at night,

16:01.656 --> 16:04.267
but I don't
think so.

16:04.354 --> 16:05.965
I think I'd
be able to tell.

16:07.879 --> 16:09.664
I think he might just
be stressed out about work.

16:09.751 --> 16:11.666
Oh. The deal.

16:11.796 --> 16:12.972
The deal.

16:17.672 --> 16:19.239
You know what? He says
everything will be

16:19.369 --> 16:21.241
finalized soon and the
money's going to be amazing

16:21.328 --> 16:22.677
and we'll finally
get out of debt

16:22.807 --> 16:26.898
and everything can go
back to normal.

16:27.029 --> 16:29.379
Careful, honey, because
once things change,

16:29.510 --> 16:32.817
they very rarely go back
to the way they were.

16:43.306 --> 16:44.699
Hey. Is the baby asleep?

16:48.050 --> 16:50.139
Aw, thank you, Paige.

16:50.270 --> 16:51.662
Ugh. I feel like
such a burden.

16:51.749 --> 16:53.186
No, no. I'm
happy to help.

16:55.318 --> 16:58.017
Look. I, um, I actually need to
talk to you about something.

17:02.151 --> 17:04.414
What's up?

17:04.545 --> 17:06.460
I-- I don't know
what's going on with Michael,

17:06.547 --> 17:10.420
but he's-- he's just been
really stressed out about work,

17:10.550 --> 17:12.640
and-- and money's
been tight for a while now.

17:12.770 --> 17:17.165
So, um...
I feel like

17:17.252 --> 17:20.126
you might need
to move out soon.

17:20.213 --> 17:21.779
I'll try to hold off as
long as possible,

17:21.910 --> 17:24.347
but he can just be
so bullheaded, you know?

17:24.434 --> 17:26.088
I just...

17:26.175 --> 17:28.438
Do you have anywhere
else you could go?

17:28.525 --> 17:29.744
I'll figure something out.

17:32.094 --> 17:33.965
Maybe we can ask my mom. I
mean, she doesn't have

17:34.096 --> 17:36.011
a ton of space, but you could
always sleep on the couch.

17:39.884 --> 17:42.061
How did I get
into this mess?

17:42.148 --> 17:43.671
I'm going to have to go
back to bartending

17:43.801 --> 17:45.629
and-- and leaving my
baby with strangers at night!

17:45.760 --> 17:47.414
I don't want that!

17:47.544 --> 17:50.025
Joslyn, it's going
to be okay, alright?

17:50.156 --> 17:52.810
I'm not abandoning you.

17:52.897 --> 17:54.160
We'll figure this
out together.

18:25.147 --> 18:25.974
Sean.

18:36.724 --> 18:38.508
I know. I know.

18:38.639 --> 18:39.727
What are you doing?

18:41.946 --> 18:43.383
The baby was crying.

18:45.559 --> 18:47.735
You didn't hear him?

18:47.822 --> 18:49.084
Give him back.

18:51.478 --> 18:52.566
I'll put him to bed.

18:59.094 --> 19:01.618
Maybe Sean should
stay with us.

19:01.705 --> 19:03.142
What are you
talking about?

19:05.144 --> 19:06.275
You know.

19:18.374 --> 19:19.680
He's mine.

19:23.553 --> 19:24.641
Goodnight.

20:07.858 --> 20:09.208
Hey.

20:11.906 --> 20:13.734
Are you-- are you okay?

20:13.864 --> 20:16.127
You don't
look too good.

20:16.258 --> 20:18.129
I'll be fine.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.915
I just didn't
much sleep last night.

20:21.002 --> 20:23.047
Yeah. No. I didn't sleep
very well, either.

20:24.788 --> 20:25.920
Joslyn: I was thinking
about what you said.

20:27.835 --> 20:30.751
And I think you're right.

20:30.838 --> 20:33.841
It's best I get out of here
sooner rather than later.

20:33.971 --> 20:36.887
I found a women's shelter
in Gilford with a bed available,

20:36.974 --> 20:39.020
and I'll stay there until I
can get my feet on the ground.

20:39.150 --> 20:40.891
Whoa, whoa, Jos. No.

20:41.022 --> 20:44.547
A-- a shelter? With a baby?

20:44.678 --> 20:47.855
Yeah. It won't
be so bad.

20:47.985 --> 20:50.205
Paige: We just need to do a
little bit of research, okay?

20:50.336 --> 20:52.251
And we're going to find you
somewhere close to here.

20:53.643 --> 20:56.167
Oh, God. You're
exhausted.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.126
How about I take the
little guy upstairs, okay?

20:58.257 --> 20:59.693
And then you
can get some sleep.

20:59.780 --> 21:00.998
Joslyn:
Really?

21:01.129 --> 21:02.739
- Yes.
- You don't have to.

21:02.870 --> 21:04.175
Don't worry
about it, okay?

21:04.306 --> 21:06.352
I got you.

21:06.439 --> 21:08.441
Come on, Sean. Okay.

21:18.451 --> 21:19.843
Oh, I know.

21:19.974 --> 21:21.932
Oh, that's what's wrong.

21:22.019 --> 21:25.936
Oh, no. I know.
I know, Sean.

21:26.067 --> 21:28.896
That's okay.
That's okay. I...

21:43.606 --> 21:44.955
Ow!

21:46.609 --> 21:48.437
How could you?

21:48.568 --> 21:50.526
After everything
I did for you?

21:50.613 --> 21:52.180
What? What are you
talking about?

21:52.267 --> 21:54.530
I saw the birthmark, Jos.

21:54.661 --> 21:56.445
Did you think that I
wouldn't see it?

21:56.576 --> 21:57.881
Oh, my gosh. Paige, wait.

21:58.012 --> 22:00.188
No! No. I want you out
of this house.

22:02.538 --> 22:03.626
How could you
even stay here?

22:03.757 --> 22:05.541
You-- you
betrayed me!

22:05.672 --> 22:08.196
You made look like
a fool in my own home!

22:09.328 --> 22:11.330
Oh, my God.

22:11.460 --> 22:13.157
Did you sleep with
him here?

22:13.244 --> 22:15.116
Of course not, Paige.
Please listen!

22:15.203 --> 22:19.033
No! No! You have been like my
sister since we were kids,

22:19.120 --> 22:22.341
and now, you have ruined
everything that I care about!

22:22.471 --> 22:24.908
How could you do
this to me?

22:24.995 --> 22:26.519
It's not
like that, Paige!

22:26.606 --> 22:29.260
I was really drunk, okay?

22:29.348 --> 22:31.480
I didn't know what
was happening!

22:31.567 --> 22:33.787
What?

22:33.874 --> 22:36.485
All I remember is someone
helping me to lie down.

22:36.616 --> 22:38.008
I thought
it was Rex,

22:38.095 --> 22:40.837
but-- but then he got
kind of aggressive.

22:40.924 --> 22:45.538
I-- I promise I didn't know
it was Mike until Sean was born.

22:45.625 --> 22:49.150
No. Mike wouldn't
do something like that.

22:49.237 --> 22:51.631
I tried to confront him,
but he threatened me,

22:51.761 --> 22:53.284
said he wouldn't let
me tear his family apart.

22:53.415 --> 22:54.590
You're lying.

22:56.462 --> 22:58.202
Rex and I hadn't been
having much sex,

22:58.289 --> 23:00.379
so he did the math,
and he figured it out.

23:00.466 --> 23:02.337
That's why he kicked me out!

23:02.468 --> 23:03.643
No. This isn't happening.

23:05.209 --> 23:06.907
I was too afraid
to tell you, Paige.

23:06.994 --> 23:08.256
- You're my best friend.
- No!

23:10.824 --> 23:12.739
I don't believe you.

23:15.872 --> 23:17.570
Mike isn't the man
you think he is.

23:58.306 --> 24:00.221
Hi. I need to speak to
Michael Johnson.

24:00.308 --> 24:02.266
- It's urgent.
- Man: Paige.

24:02.353 --> 24:03.572
What are
you doing here?

24:03.703 --> 24:05.705
I need to speak
to Michael.

24:05.792 --> 24:07.141
What? What--
what is it, Jeff?

24:08.490 --> 24:09.622
Where's Mike?

24:09.752 --> 24:11.145
He doesn't work here anymore.

24:11.232 --> 24:13.974
What? No.
No.

24:14.104 --> 24:15.236
He's working on a big deal.

24:15.323 --> 24:17.368
He has all
these meetings.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.370
He said it's
his biggest one yet.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.807
He left months ago.

24:20.937 --> 24:22.373
Said he had
a better gig.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.419
I'm not sure what
he's doing now.

24:24.550 --> 24:25.333
He didn't tell you?

24:33.994 --> 24:34.821
Paige.

25:09.159 --> 25:10.770
What can I get you?

25:10.857 --> 25:14.948
Um, I'll just have
a water, please.

25:15.035 --> 25:18.299
One water coming up.

25:18.386 --> 25:19.518
Can I ask you
a question?

25:21.389 --> 25:23.043
Shoot.

25:23.130 --> 25:27.700
Um, my husband comes here
a lot. Do you know him?

25:27.787 --> 25:31.051
Mike? Yeah. He's
in here all the time.

25:32.226 --> 25:34.097
Alone?

25:34.184 --> 25:35.708
He kind of comes and goes
with different people.

25:37.274 --> 25:38.972
What kind of people?

25:39.102 --> 25:40.364
Can't really say.

25:42.018 --> 25:44.455
Do you have a--
a name? Anything?

25:44.543 --> 25:46.675
Look, lady. It's
none of my business.

25:48.764 --> 25:50.026
Paige:
Please.

25:53.769 --> 25:54.683
Meet me outside.

26:03.866 --> 26:06.434
Tell you, he don't seem like no
real estate broker to me.

26:08.741 --> 26:10.569
Why would you say that?

26:10.699 --> 26:12.571
Mike's been coming in with
some pretty heavy guys lately.

26:13.615 --> 26:16.009
Guys?

26:16.096 --> 26:18.402
Thought you were going to
catch him cheating, didn't you?

26:18.489 --> 26:22.493
I'm afraid what Mike's into...
might be worse than that.

26:22.624 --> 26:26.236
These guys make
some serious deals.

26:26.323 --> 26:27.977
Well, Mike's been working on
this big real estate deal.

26:28.108 --> 26:30.414
Maybe he just went
out on his own.

26:30.501 --> 26:33.156
Those aren't the kind
of deals I'm talking about,

26:33.243 --> 26:35.158
if you catch my drift.

26:35.245 --> 26:38.422
D-Drugs? No.

26:38.509 --> 26:40.773
You don't know your husband
very well, do you, lady?

26:42.383 --> 26:43.602
I hate to give you bad news,

26:43.732 --> 26:46.126
but, uh, he's
in pretty deep.

26:47.606 --> 26:50.086
People are even
scared of him now.

26:50.173 --> 26:53.220
The kind of guys
he's associated with

26:53.350 --> 26:54.961
are not the kind of guys
you want to mess with.

26:58.442 --> 27:01.054
Look. I can't say
much more than that...

27:01.184 --> 27:03.970
except... be careful.

27:05.232 --> 27:06.276
Well, just give me a name!

27:06.363 --> 27:08.365
Don't go sniffing around.

27:08.452 --> 27:09.802
You're going to get yourself
in a whole lot of trouble.

27:09.889 --> 27:11.151
Please.

27:13.327 --> 27:14.894
Got a pen?

27:14.981 --> 27:15.764
Yeah. Uh...

27:25.513 --> 27:26.340
Don't be stupid.

27:41.181 --> 27:44.793
Oh, hey, Paige. Uh, Tanner
already left with Mr. Johnson.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.577
He showed up early and
pulled him out of class.

27:46.708 --> 27:49.015
Said it was a surprise.

27:49.145 --> 27:50.625
Oh.

27:50.756 --> 27:52.235
Is everything okay?

27:52.322 --> 27:54.803
Yes. No. Uh,
everything is fine.

27:54.890 --> 27:58.415
Um, did-- did he say
where they were going?

27:58.502 --> 28:01.375
Sorry. I was really busy,
and I was finishing up class.

28:01.462 --> 28:02.985
- I didn't think to do--
- Yeah. No, no, no. Of course.

28:03.072 --> 28:05.205
Of course. Um,
thanks, Miss Bailey.

28:10.079 --> 28:12.168
Mike, you didn't tell me

28:12.255 --> 28:13.387
you were getting Tanner today.

28:13.517 --> 28:15.737
Um, can you
just pick up?

28:15.824 --> 28:17.217
I want to know
where you guys are.

28:17.304 --> 28:19.610
Call me back.

28:23.136 --> 28:25.225
Mike, why aren't you calling
me back? Where are you?

28:44.940 --> 28:45.724
Woman:
Hey, Paige!

29:06.919 --> 29:08.877
Oh!

29:09.008 --> 29:10.574
Oh, thank goodness!

29:10.661 --> 29:12.489
There you are!
Where have you been?

29:12.620 --> 29:13.926
Dad took me to the
movies and the arcade.

29:14.013 --> 29:16.015
- Look at what we won, Mom.
- Oh, wow! Wow!

29:16.102 --> 29:17.451
What a day
you must have had!

29:17.581 --> 29:19.845
Oh, you are
so sticky. Okay.

29:19.932 --> 29:21.847
Um, go upstairs and get ready
for bed, okay? It's late.

29:21.977 --> 29:23.152
But wait, Mom.

29:23.239 --> 29:24.632
Listen to your mom, buddy.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.990
Well, that was one
hell of a stunt.

29:35.121 --> 29:37.776
- Stunt?
- Michael, I have been calling

29:37.906 --> 29:40.387
and texting
you for hours!

29:40.474 --> 29:43.042
You cannot just take Tanner out
of school and then disappear

29:43.172 --> 29:45.479
and not notify me and
then turn off your phone!

29:45.609 --> 29:47.481
I didn't turn off
my phone.

29:47.568 --> 29:49.744
Oh, so you were just ignoring
me. That's even worse!

29:49.875 --> 29:51.833
Come on. We were just
trying to have some fun.

29:51.964 --> 29:54.140
I wanted to celebrate.

29:54.270 --> 29:55.489
- Celebrate?
- Yes, babe.

29:55.576 --> 29:57.404
The deal is
moving forward.

29:57.491 --> 29:59.710
I wanted to show Tanner a good
time and give you a break.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.364
I know you
need to relax.

30:01.451 --> 30:04.193
To relax? I have
been worried sick!

30:04.280 --> 30:06.500
Okay, okay. I should have
called you. I'm sorry.

30:06.587 --> 30:08.197
Michael, you
cannot do this.

30:08.284 --> 30:09.546
It is irresponsible.

30:09.677 --> 30:11.418
What if you had gotten
into an accident

30:11.505 --> 30:13.072
and I didn't know
where you were?

30:13.159 --> 30:15.030
He's my son! I can spend a
day with him if I want!

30:15.161 --> 30:17.293
No! No, you cannot!
Not like that!

30:17.380 --> 30:19.165
Not without
notifying me!

30:19.295 --> 30:20.775
Do not stand
here in my house

30:20.862 --> 30:22.342
and tell me what I can
do with my own son!

30:22.472 --> 30:23.299
You are not
listening to me!

30:23.430 --> 30:24.692
I am a good father!

30:26.868 --> 30:29.088
There is nothing in this world
that I wouldn't do for that boy!

30:29.175 --> 30:30.567
If you ever try to
come between us,

30:30.654 --> 30:31.481
I will...

30:58.552 --> 30:59.770
Paige?

31:02.512 --> 31:04.471
You okay?

31:04.558 --> 31:06.603
My life is ruined.

31:06.690 --> 31:07.866
What?

31:11.478 --> 31:13.175
I just wish that none
of this had ever happened.

31:16.439 --> 31:20.879
I just want things to go back to
the way they were, but...

31:20.966 --> 31:22.054
they can't.

31:23.751 --> 31:24.883
I just...

31:27.537 --> 31:28.756
I just want be happy.

31:33.500 --> 31:35.023
I'm so sorry, Paige.

31:35.110 --> 31:36.242
Don't!

31:39.767 --> 31:42.596
Everything is just
such a... mess.

32:00.875 --> 32:02.094
Man:
Mrs. Johnson?

32:02.224 --> 32:04.705
My name is
Detective Anderson.

32:04.792 --> 32:06.489
Would you like
a cup of coffee?

32:06.576 --> 32:10.189
- No.
- How can I help you today?

32:10.319 --> 32:14.323
Um...

32:14.454 --> 32:17.936
I-- I-- I have no idea
where to, um, start.

32:18.023 --> 32:19.676
It says here this has something
to do with your husband,

32:19.807 --> 32:22.288
a Michael Johnson.
What seems to be the problem?

32:24.116 --> 32:28.424
Um... my husband isn't
who he says he is.

32:31.427 --> 32:33.342
How do you mean?

32:33.429 --> 32:35.954
He's, um, been lying,

32:36.041 --> 32:39.305
and, uh... I think
he might be involved

32:39.392 --> 32:42.482
in some criminal activity.

32:44.875 --> 32:47.182
I'm just-- I'm worried
for our safety.

32:47.313 --> 32:49.402
- You have children?
- Yes. Uh, sorry.

32:49.532 --> 32:52.318
Uh, I have a son, Tanner.
He's, uh, he's seven.

32:52.448 --> 32:54.320
And you don't feel safe
in your home?

32:54.407 --> 32:55.886
Has he ever been violent
with you in the past?

32:55.974 --> 32:59.020
No, no, not-- not
me, but...

32:59.107 --> 33:01.892
well, I think he might
have been with my friend.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.764
Anderson:
Your friend. Who is that?

33:03.851 --> 33:06.158
Uh, Joslyn Martin.

33:06.245 --> 33:10.075
Uh, she's staying with us
until she can find a place.

33:10.162 --> 33:11.511
And you think that he
may have assaulted her?

33:15.167 --> 33:16.995
She said she
doesn't remember.

33:17.082 --> 33:21.912
Um, she was drunk and-- and
maybe... something else,

33:22.043 --> 33:26.308
but... I know
she didn't ask for it.

33:26.439 --> 33:28.310
Did she file any charges?

33:28.397 --> 33:30.182
Have any evidence,
something we can go on?

33:33.054 --> 33:35.013
Oh, I mean, the baby
does have the birthmark.

33:36.666 --> 33:38.668
I'm sorry.
I don't follow.

33:38.799 --> 33:42.411
Uh, uh, my-- my husband has a
birthmark on his stomach.

33:42.498 --> 33:43.847
He's very proud of it.

33:43.934 --> 33:45.545
Um, all the men
in his family have it.

33:45.632 --> 33:47.721
It's genetic,
I guess.

33:47.851 --> 33:50.376
Um, well, the--
the baby--

33:50.506 --> 33:53.944
the baby has the--
the birthmark.

33:54.032 --> 33:58.775
So, I guess
that's proof that, um...

33:58.862 --> 34:03.041
that my husband...
is the father.

34:05.086 --> 34:07.567
I see.

34:07.697 --> 34:09.221
I'm sorry. I,
uh... I just...

34:12.876 --> 34:14.052
I really love
my husband.

34:16.315 --> 34:17.967
He is a good father.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.534
I just...

34:21.494 --> 34:23.061
I don't recognize
him anymore.

34:24.627 --> 34:26.107
What is it you'd
like us to do here?

34:32.025 --> 34:34.420
He's just been acting weird ever
since Joslyn moved in,

34:34.507 --> 34:37.639
and I thought that I would go
and confront him myself.

34:37.726 --> 34:39.467
But when I got to
his office, they told me

34:39.599 --> 34:41.643
that he hadn't been
working there in months.

34:41.731 --> 34:43.951
He had been worried about some
deal, and I-- I just assumed

34:44.038 --> 34:47.041
it was real estate, but
now, I'm think that it...

34:47.128 --> 34:49.043
it might be drugs.

34:49.130 --> 34:50.827
And what makes you
think that?

34:50.914 --> 34:55.614
Well, he's been doing
business, um, with this man.

34:59.793 --> 35:01.099
Roman D'Mante.

35:03.188 --> 35:05.712
Yeah. What? Do
you know of him?

35:05.842 --> 35:07.888
Have you ever seen
your husband with this man?

35:07.975 --> 35:10.238
Seen any sign of drugs or
suspicious activity

35:10.369 --> 35:12.371
- around your house?
- No. No.

35:12.458 --> 35:14.808
He-- he usually goes out
at night, uh, for his meetings.

35:14.895 --> 35:16.592
Anderson: I'm going to have
to make some inquiries.

35:16.679 --> 35:18.507
If I could get you to wait here,
just for a little while--

35:18.594 --> 35:20.988
Oh, no. I can't. I have to
go pick up my son at school.

35:24.426 --> 35:27.429
You say that you don't feel
like you're in any danger

35:27.516 --> 35:28.604
at home right now?

35:30.128 --> 35:32.086
- No.
- Okay. Go get your boy,

35:32.173 --> 35:34.349
and I will call
you later tonight.

35:34.480 --> 35:35.829
Will you be free
to take a phone call?

35:35.916 --> 35:37.831
Yeah. Yeah.
I think I will.

35:37.918 --> 35:41.226
Alright. Here's my card.

35:41.356 --> 35:44.577
If you feel like you're
in any danger whatsoever,

35:44.707 --> 35:47.971
I want you to call me right
away. Do you understand?

35:50.322 --> 35:53.325
Alright. Take care,
Mrs. Johnson.

36:09.863 --> 36:11.343
Who was that?

36:11.473 --> 36:13.780
Oh, no one.
Just unknown number.

36:13.867 --> 36:15.173
Probably a scam.

36:20.352 --> 36:22.049
When's dinner? I
am starving.

36:22.136 --> 36:23.703
Uh, it's coming up.

36:25.444 --> 36:27.315
No meetings tonight?

36:27.446 --> 36:29.448
No. Staying home to watch
the game with Tanner.

36:29.578 --> 36:31.014
Paige:
Oh.

36:31.101 --> 36:33.060
Hey, Jos.

36:34.757 --> 36:36.759
Oh, sorry. I didn't want
to disturb you.

36:36.846 --> 36:38.196
No. Wait.

36:42.243 --> 36:43.070
Come here.

36:55.082 --> 36:55.909
Can I hold him?

37:04.874 --> 37:06.702
There he is.

37:06.833 --> 37:08.269
What a handsome boy.

37:14.362 --> 37:16.843
Maybe we should watch
him for the night.

37:16.930 --> 37:18.061
Give you a break, huh?

37:20.368 --> 37:21.717
Joslyn: It's fine. I was
just getting a snack.

37:21.804 --> 37:24.067
No, no. It's okay.

37:24.154 --> 37:28.246
Grab something to eat. Go
downstairs. Relax.

37:28.333 --> 37:29.595
He can watch the
game with us.

37:31.814 --> 37:33.033
You look so tired.

37:33.163 --> 37:34.643
Mike, I-- I
think she's fine.

37:34.774 --> 37:36.950
What's the big deal?

37:37.080 --> 37:38.386
Just babysit him
for a while.

37:41.520 --> 37:42.564
You don't mind, do you?

37:50.137 --> 37:51.878
Tanner, it's game
time! Let's go!

37:51.965 --> 37:54.750
Tanner:
Coming, Dad!

37:54.837 --> 37:56.709
It's okay. It's okay, alright?

37:56.839 --> 37:58.406
I'll watch him.

37:58.493 --> 37:59.625
Michael: Paige, the
game's starting! Come on!

38:16.381 --> 38:18.861
Anderson: Hello, Ms. Johnson.
This is Detective Anderson.

38:18.992 --> 38:21.037
I talked to my colleague
about your situation,

38:21.168 --> 38:23.213
and I'm afraid there isn't
a whole lot we can do

38:23.344 --> 38:25.651
without any evidence.

38:25.738 --> 38:28.741
I shouldn't say this,
but maybe if you call me back,

38:28.871 --> 38:30.308
there might be a way we can
help each other out here.

38:57.900 --> 38:59.685
I got to head out.

38:59.772 --> 39:01.904
Again? It's 8:30.

39:01.991 --> 39:03.515
Oh, it's just work, honey.

39:05.778 --> 39:06.866
I'll be back in a few hours.

39:15.091 --> 39:16.963
Joslyn, I need you
watch Tanner for a bit!

39:17.050 --> 39:17.833
Joslyn:
Okay!

39:47.646 --> 39:49.604
Jeez!

39:49.735 --> 39:51.519
Um, sorry. No, I don't
have any change.

39:54.304 --> 39:56.481
Sorry. No.

40:02.791 --> 40:04.663
Ugh!

40:52.145 --> 40:53.320
Babe?

40:55.670 --> 40:56.802
Baby?

40:58.238 --> 40:59.631
You awake?

41:09.815 --> 41:10.946
Babe?

41:12.078 --> 41:14.689
Hey, babe, wake up.

41:14.776 --> 41:19.085
Oh, I'm sorry I've been
so hard on you lately.

41:19.215 --> 41:21.261
But I think we can fix things.

41:21.391 --> 41:25.004
Huh? I really want things to be
the way they used to be.

41:26.396 --> 41:28.311
We were happy. Me, you, Tanner.

41:28.442 --> 41:30.966
All of us.

41:31.097 --> 41:32.838
No, no, Michael.
I don't want to.

41:34.535 --> 41:36.015
Come on, baby.

41:36.145 --> 41:38.365
No. Michael,
you can't just fix things.

41:38.452 --> 41:39.932
Sex is not going to make this
go away!

41:40.062 --> 41:41.803
You're my wife, Paige.

41:44.023 --> 41:45.372
Get off of me!

42:07.916 --> 42:09.701
Good morning, sleeping beauty.

42:11.050 --> 42:12.573
Want some pancakes?

42:12.704 --> 42:15.054
Um--

42:15.184 --> 42:17.056
Tanner already ate.
He's getting school stuff.

42:18.666 --> 42:21.103
Uh, you're going to take him
to school?

42:21.234 --> 42:22.540
Yeah.

42:22.627 --> 42:23.802
I took the morning off.

42:23.889 --> 42:25.717
I, um,

42:25.847 --> 42:30.025
figured you could use a
little time for some self-love.

42:30.112 --> 42:32.550
So, why don't you make a bath
and just relax this morning?

42:34.073 --> 42:35.248
Okay?

42:36.815 --> 42:38.207
Okay. You got everything?

42:38.338 --> 42:39.557
- Yep.
- All right. Let's go.

42:44.518 --> 42:46.259
See you later, sweetheart.

42:47.739 --> 42:48.914
Tanner:
Bye, Mom.

43:04.190 --> 43:05.408
I'm sorry.

43:05.495 --> 43:08.629
I should've believed you.

43:12.938 --> 43:14.026
You okay?

43:17.159 --> 43:20.293
My stomach is in knots.
I don't recognize him anymore.

43:20.380 --> 43:22.425
I can't trust him.

43:22.512 --> 43:25.428
I have no idea
what he's going to do next.

43:25.515 --> 43:28.431
Jos, I think we need to go.

43:28.518 --> 43:30.172
We?

43:30.303 --> 43:32.610
I can't do this alone.

43:34.263 --> 43:35.569
Yeah.

43:35.656 --> 43:38.572
Okay.

43:38.703 --> 43:39.834
Where are we going to go?
What about your mom's?

43:39.965 --> 43:41.836
No, no.

43:41.923 --> 43:44.099
I can't do that to her
after everything with my dad.

43:44.186 --> 43:45.623
Besides, it's the first place
he'll look.

43:45.753 --> 43:48.451
No. We need to get far away
from Mike.

43:48.538 --> 43:50.062
Far away
from everything he knows.

43:50.149 --> 43:51.541
Paige,

43:51.629 --> 43:54.066
- I have no money.
- That's okay.

43:54.196 --> 43:55.589
That's okay. I have the car.
I have a few dollars for gas.

43:55.676 --> 43:57.460
A few dollars

43:57.547 --> 43:59.114
isn't going to get us
very far with two kids to feed.

43:59.201 --> 44:01.029
I know. I know. You're right.

44:03.553 --> 44:05.120
If you can take Sean
in the evenings,

44:05.207 --> 44:06.731
I can go back to the bar.
We can save it up.

44:06.818 --> 44:08.602
No, no. We don't have time.

44:08.733 --> 44:10.386
I mean, who knows what trouble
he's gotten himself into?

44:10.473 --> 44:13.041
Us into.
We need to protect the boys.

44:13.128 --> 44:15.827
I just--
I couldn't live with myself

44:15.914 --> 44:18.307
if anything happened to Tanner
or Sean.

44:18.394 --> 44:20.658
Paige, you're scaring me.

44:22.747 --> 44:25.793
But if it means our sons
will be safe,

44:25.880 --> 44:27.099
I'll go.

44:28.709 --> 44:30.145
How much do you think
we'll need?

44:30.232 --> 44:31.451
Oh, I don't know.

44:31.538 --> 44:33.105
Between getting out of state,

44:33.192 --> 44:35.716
lodging, food, and--

44:35.847 --> 44:37.500
Four grand?

44:37.631 --> 44:39.459
We can't exactly sell the car.

44:42.244 --> 44:44.986
I could sell some of my jewelry.

44:45.117 --> 44:46.901
My wedding rings.

44:47.032 --> 44:49.643
How much do you think
they're worth?

44:49.730 --> 44:51.036
I don't know.

44:53.212 --> 44:54.561
It's a start.

45:13.275 --> 45:14.712
Can I help you?

45:14.799 --> 45:18.454
Yes. I would like to sell
some things.

45:18.585 --> 45:21.066
Well, you came to
the right place for that.

45:27.507 --> 45:29.378
Are you kidding? That's it?

45:29.465 --> 45:31.032
What can I say?

45:31.119 --> 45:33.252
The resale is just not great
on this stuff.

45:46.395 --> 45:49.007
It was my mother's.

45:49.137 --> 45:51.705
I can give you 500 bucks for it.

45:51.836 --> 45:54.099
It's worth three times that
at least.

45:55.796 --> 45:57.145
Come on.

45:57.232 --> 45:59.452
I just--
I really need this money.

45:59.582 --> 46:00.714
Can you just

46:00.845 --> 46:03.630
cut me a break?

46:03.717 --> 46:06.067
Throw in those earrings,
and I'll make it an even thou.

46:12.073 --> 46:14.336
You enjoy taking advantage
of women?

46:14.467 --> 46:16.556
Well, you know, you can't always
get what you want.

46:28.829 --> 46:30.178
A thousand bucks

46:30.265 --> 46:32.398
for almost all my jewelry.

46:32.485 --> 46:34.400
I'm worthless, clearly.

46:34.487 --> 46:37.185
- You did good, Paige.
- No. It's not enough.

46:37.316 --> 46:39.535
We'll leave here
and be starving within weeks.

46:39.666 --> 46:42.974
I can try calling Rex.
Ask for money.

46:43.061 --> 46:45.367
No, no. We're not taking
anything from that dirtbag.

46:45.498 --> 46:46.760
I don't trust him
as far as I can throw him.

46:48.675 --> 46:50.198
You know what?

46:50.329 --> 46:52.679
I can ask my old boss
from the bar.

46:52.810 --> 46:54.594
He's a good guy
and kind of a friend.

46:54.724 --> 46:56.248
He might lend us something.

47:20.489 --> 47:23.014
Hey, honey.
What you up to out there?

47:23.101 --> 47:25.451
- Just something for my clients.
- Ah.

47:31.718 --> 47:33.633
Where's Joslyn?

47:33.763 --> 47:35.635
Oh, she's just running errands.

47:35.765 --> 47:38.203
That's a first.

47:39.639 --> 47:42.555
Oh, don't-- Don't bug him.

47:42.685 --> 47:43.904
I'm just going to get him
to sleep.

47:44.035 --> 47:45.123
Michael:
Well, he's a good-looking kid.

47:45.210 --> 47:46.385
I'll give him that.

47:46.472 --> 47:49.605
Are you going out?

47:49.736 --> 47:50.911
Later.

47:50.998 --> 47:52.782
I'm finalizing everything.

47:52.870 --> 47:54.001
And tomorrow is the big day,
babe.

47:54.088 --> 47:55.611
It's going to change everything.

47:55.742 --> 47:57.135
I'm so excited for you.
You're going to do great.

47:57.265 --> 47:59.006
Mm-hmm. I can't lose.

47:59.137 --> 48:02.227
You know, I was thinking...

48:04.272 --> 48:05.491
...maybe we could adopt Sean.

48:05.578 --> 48:07.493
What?

48:07.580 --> 48:10.670
I mean, we've always talked
about having another child.

48:10.800 --> 48:13.194
Joslyn can't get on her feet
and is obviously overwhelmed.

48:13.281 --> 48:15.240
I could look at new houses.
More space for the kids.

48:15.370 --> 48:16.719
The kids?

48:16.850 --> 48:18.765
Yeah! Tanner and Sean
can be brothers.

48:25.903 --> 48:28.035
What is it?

48:28.166 --> 48:31.604
No. I'm just, um, so excited
for this deal to be done, honey.

48:31.734 --> 48:34.650
Good.

48:34.737 --> 48:36.522
Why don't we go away
next weekend?

48:36.609 --> 48:38.132
- Take Tanner somewhere fun.
- I would love that.

48:44.225 --> 48:46.358
Where's your ring?

48:46.488 --> 48:47.663
I got-- I, uh--

48:47.794 --> 48:50.101
I was just cleaning the bathroom

48:50.188 --> 48:53.582
and I think I just left them
upstairs.

48:53.669 --> 48:56.368
Well,

48:56.498 --> 48:57.847
I wouldn't want anyone thinking
you're a free woman.

48:57.978 --> 48:59.240
Oh, no. Don't you worry.

49:01.460 --> 49:03.201
I'm going to take a nap.
I got a big night.

49:03.288 --> 49:04.637
Okay.

49:16.127 --> 49:17.258
Paige?

49:17.345 --> 49:20.174
There you are.

49:20.261 --> 49:22.960
Always lurking
in the shadows, huh, Jos?

49:25.005 --> 49:27.138
Why are you so happy?

49:28.835 --> 49:30.663
Michael:
Oh.

49:30.793 --> 49:32.404
You finally going to pay me
some rent?

49:35.189 --> 49:36.408
You live under my roof, you pay.

49:36.495 --> 49:38.105
Michael!

49:38.192 --> 49:39.977
She's supposed to be gone.
Remember?

49:42.457 --> 49:44.677
You don't want to be as useless
as that deadbeat ex, do you?

49:51.814 --> 49:55.383
You just bought yourself
another day.

49:55.470 --> 49:57.429
Maybe we should tell her about
our little proposition.

50:16.317 --> 50:20.104
Jos, I'm sorry, okay?

50:20.191 --> 50:22.932
It's going to be okay.
We're going to be okay.

50:23.020 --> 50:24.412
Proposition?

50:24.543 --> 50:27.024
What the hell
was he talking about?

50:30.636 --> 50:31.724
He wants to adopt Sean.

50:34.509 --> 50:36.642
What?

50:36.729 --> 50:38.078
He wants you out of the picture

50:38.165 --> 50:40.124
so that Sean
can come and live with us.

50:40.211 --> 50:42.996
He knows.

50:43.083 --> 50:44.432
He must've seen the birthmark
or just assumed.

50:44.563 --> 50:46.478
I don't know.

50:46.565 --> 50:48.045
Mama?

50:48.132 --> 50:50.003
Hey, buddy. Hi.

50:50.134 --> 50:51.874
I can't fall asleep.

50:51.961 --> 50:54.225
Oh. Okay. Do you want to
go upstairs and read a story?

50:55.878 --> 50:57.967
Um, okay.

50:58.055 --> 50:59.882
How about we watch a movie, huh?

50:59.969 --> 51:01.754
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

51:03.451 --> 51:05.932
Um, okay.

51:06.019 --> 51:08.065
Why don't you stay
with Auntie Joslyn, all right?

51:08.195 --> 51:12.199
And I will-- I'll be right back.

51:12.286 --> 51:14.071
What movie do you want to watch?

52:31.104 --> 52:33.150
- Joslyn?
- Where have you been?

52:34.412 --> 52:36.196
What is it?

52:36.283 --> 52:38.155
We have the money.

52:39.852 --> 52:40.983
Where did you--

52:41.114 --> 52:42.420
It doesn't matter. Okay, go.

52:42.507 --> 52:43.638
Get everything you need,
all right?

52:43.725 --> 52:45.074
We're leaving now.

52:45.162 --> 52:46.293
I don't think this a good idea,
Paige.

52:46.424 --> 52:47.555
Do you have a better one?

52:47.642 --> 52:49.427
This is our chance, Jos.

52:49.514 --> 52:51.385
- But--
- No. Let's just go.

52:51.472 --> 52:52.995
Okay? Now.

53:02.614 --> 53:04.355
Mommy, where are we going?

53:04.442 --> 53:06.879
We are going on a vacation.
It's going to be fun.

53:07.009 --> 53:09.751
I don't want to go
on a vacation.

53:09.838 --> 53:11.231
Tanner, I know that it's late.
I know you're tired.

53:11.362 --> 53:13.755
But I need you to be brave,
okay?

53:13.886 --> 53:15.583
Why don't you grab a toy
you can bring, okay?

53:15.670 --> 53:16.802
Where's Daddy?

53:18.412 --> 53:19.892
Daddy's not coming this time.

53:20.022 --> 53:22.199
I want Daddy! I'm not going.

53:22.286 --> 53:23.330
Tanner, Tanner!
It's going to be okay.

53:23.461 --> 53:25.941
But we need to go, now.

53:26.072 --> 53:27.682
Okay? Come on.

53:27.813 --> 53:30.729
Come on, buddy. All right.

54:01.760 --> 54:03.022
Oh, no.

54:03.109 --> 54:05.111
What? Do you know him?

54:05.198 --> 54:06.939
I've seen him around.

54:07.069 --> 54:09.333
Rex used to talk about him.

54:09.463 --> 54:11.944
If he has anything to do with
this money,

54:12.031 --> 54:14.033
we're in deep trouble.

54:14.163 --> 54:15.252
- He'll find us anywhere we go.
- Okay, okay.

54:15.382 --> 54:16.949
So, out of state
isn't far enough?

54:18.603 --> 54:20.344
I don't think so.

54:20.431 --> 54:22.128
- Tanner: Mama!
- Oh, Buddy.

54:23.738 --> 54:27.046
Hey.

54:27.176 --> 54:29.178
- Oh, buddy.
- I want Teddy.

54:29.309 --> 54:30.615
Oh, buddy.

54:30.702 --> 54:32.617
Buddy, you didn't bring him?

54:32.704 --> 54:33.966
No.

54:34.053 --> 54:36.229
Shh.

54:36.360 --> 54:37.796
You have to be quiet, okay?
You have to stop crying.

54:37.926 --> 54:39.406
You're going to wake the baby.

54:39.493 --> 54:40.581
Okay. We'll get you
a new teddy, okay?

54:40.668 --> 54:41.887
I want my teddy.

54:43.454 --> 54:44.977
Tanner:
Where are we going?

54:45.064 --> 54:47.632
- Uh--
- I want Daddy!

54:51.026 --> 54:52.941
I'll go check in, okay?

55:03.169 --> 55:04.475
Are you serious?

55:04.605 --> 55:06.912
We only need it for one night.

55:06.999 --> 55:09.480
We need a credit card on file
for incidentals.

55:11.960 --> 55:14.485
Yeah, yeah. We'll take it.

55:23.189 --> 55:24.451
I'm just going to go make
a call.

55:38.378 --> 55:42.121
Mother:
Oh, I'm so sorry, darling.

55:42.208 --> 55:45.254
Don't tell me where you are.
The less I know, the better.

55:45.342 --> 55:48.127
I want you to get in touch with
my cousin Raymond.

55:48.257 --> 55:50.869
He's a wonderful man.
Just take this number down.

55:52.305 --> 55:53.959
And then I'll call him

55:54.046 --> 55:57.484
and I'll tell him everything
that you told me.

55:57.615 --> 55:59.617
And he'll arrange to get you
across the border

55:59.747 --> 56:00.792
and into Canada.

56:00.879 --> 56:04.012
Wait. Mom, what?

56:04.143 --> 56:07.276
You have to be somewhere safe,
Paige, until things calm down.

56:07.364 --> 56:10.889
- Raymond will sort it all.
- Mom, I don't know. I mean--

56:11.019 --> 56:13.065
Honey, what are your options?

56:13.195 --> 56:15.459
- I don't have our passports.
- What?

56:15.546 --> 56:16.590
I don't know.
We were leaving in such a rush,

56:16.677 --> 56:17.896
I forgot to take them.

56:17.983 --> 56:19.811
Jesus, Paige!

56:19.941 --> 56:21.421
I didn't know that we were
leaving the country, Mom.

56:21.508 --> 56:23.989
Okay, okay. I will go

56:24.119 --> 56:25.947
and I will get them,
and I will bring them to you.

56:26.034 --> 56:29.255
No, no, no. I don't want to
get you involved. I'll just--

56:29.386 --> 56:31.039
- I'll go back.
- No!

56:31.126 --> 56:32.867
Paige, that's a bad idea.

56:32.954 --> 56:34.042
Michael will be looking for you.

56:34.129 --> 56:35.392
I know. I know.

56:36.828 --> 56:38.525
It's okay. I'll be careful.

56:38.656 --> 56:40.745
I just-- I won't go in
if I know that he's home.

56:43.182 --> 56:44.401
Love you, Mom.

56:44.531 --> 56:46.533
Paige, I love you, too, darling.

56:46.620 --> 56:49.841
But listen to me.
You be careful, okay?

56:54.715 --> 56:57.283
Leave the country?
What's going on?

56:58.327 --> 56:59.416
Um--

57:01.069 --> 57:02.897
I, um--

57:02.984 --> 57:04.377
I just need you to watch
the kids, okay?

57:04.464 --> 57:06.248
And I'll be back
as soon as I can.

57:06.335 --> 57:07.424
No, no. It's too dangerous.

57:07.511 --> 57:08.686
If I'm not,

57:08.816 --> 57:10.339
then you have the money.

57:10.470 --> 57:11.906
So, just get a new car

57:11.993 --> 57:13.473
and keep going as planned, okay?

57:13.560 --> 57:15.127
Paige, this is crazy.

57:15.214 --> 57:16.868
If Tanner wakes up,

57:16.998 --> 57:18.435
just tell him that
I went to go get his teddy.

58:31.333 --> 58:32.683
Paige?

58:37.818 --> 58:40.125
Oh, you witch.

58:40.212 --> 58:41.387
Paige?

58:47.262 --> 58:49.351
- What's going on, Paige?
- Huh?

58:49.438 --> 58:51.136
You break into my shed?

58:51.223 --> 58:53.268
No, no. Let go!

58:55.270 --> 58:57.621
I know who you are.
I know what you did to Joslyn!

58:57.751 --> 58:59.492
She's a liar.

58:59.579 --> 59:02.539
I know that Sean is your baby!

59:05.977 --> 59:07.674
Where are they, Paige?
Where are my boys?

59:09.458 --> 59:11.852
- You're a liar and a fraud.
- No, no, no.

59:11.939 --> 59:13.637
I did this for us, Paige.
I did this for our family.

59:13.724 --> 59:15.987
Where are they?

59:21.296 --> 59:22.689
I hate you.

59:25.823 --> 59:27.172
Oh, why, why, why, Paige?

59:27.259 --> 59:29.304
Why? Why'd you make me do that?

59:29.391 --> 59:31.350
Huh?

59:31.437 --> 59:33.352
How could you be so ungrateful?

59:33.482 --> 59:35.180
I've literally done everything
for you in your life.

59:35.267 --> 59:37.704
You really thought you could
get away with this?

59:37.835 --> 59:39.401
Now, where is my money?

59:39.488 --> 59:41.839
Oof!

1:00:11.042 --> 1:00:13.784
Come on. We need to go.

1:00:13.914 --> 1:00:15.394
We need to go. Come on. Come on.

1:00:15.524 --> 1:00:16.743
- Shh.
- Come on.

1:00:26.448 --> 1:00:27.754
Oh, my God.

1:00:27.885 --> 1:00:29.800
Mike, Mike. He came back.

1:00:29.930 --> 1:00:31.410
I barely made it out. I mean,

1:00:31.540 --> 1:00:32.977
I hit him with a poker.

1:00:33.107 --> 1:00:34.979
Oh, my God.

1:00:35.066 --> 1:00:37.546
If he comes to,
he's going to go ballistic.

1:00:37.634 --> 1:00:41.072
If he doesn't,
that's even worse.

1:00:41.159 --> 1:00:42.595
- Paige, you need to rest.
- No, no, no.

1:00:42.682 --> 1:00:43.988
I can't sleep.

1:00:44.118 --> 1:00:46.251
My heart is beating
out of my chest.

1:00:46.381 --> 1:00:49.820
Jos, I can't wait. I used
my credit card to get in here.

1:00:49.907 --> 1:00:51.038
He's going to track us.

1:00:51.169 --> 1:00:53.171
If he's alive.

1:00:53.258 --> 1:00:55.390
Either way, we need to go.
We need to go.

1:00:55.521 --> 1:00:57.392
We need to get as far away
from here as possible.

1:00:57.523 --> 1:01:00.395
Okay, okay. Yeah.

1:01:00.482 --> 1:01:01.832
- Let's not wake up the kids.
- Okay.

1:02:32.400 --> 1:02:33.575
Paige?

1:02:43.977 --> 1:02:45.413
Answer your phone, Paige.
I want my boys back.

1:02:49.548 --> 1:02:51.202
Listen to me, you stupid--

1:02:51.289 --> 1:02:52.899
You better turn your ass around
and bring my boys home.

1:02:53.030 --> 1:02:54.292
Oh, and that money you took?

1:02:54.422 --> 1:02:56.250
There's some heavy dudes
behind this deal.

1:02:56.337 --> 1:02:57.599
A lot worse than me coming
for you if you don't return it.

1:02:57.686 --> 1:02:59.297
You understand?

1:03:19.360 --> 1:03:20.579
It's him again.

1:03:20.666 --> 1:03:22.799
I'll just turn it off.

1:03:22.929 --> 1:03:24.713
- Phones have GPS.
- Well, I know,

1:03:24.844 --> 1:03:26.933
but we can't be out here
without a phone.

1:03:27.020 --> 1:03:29.240
I'll just-- I'll turn it on
in emergencies.

1:03:31.720 --> 1:03:34.680
What about one of those cheap
phones, like in the movies?

1:03:34.811 --> 1:03:38.118
Like a burner phone?

1:03:38.205 --> 1:03:40.033
That's a good idea.
And then, we can just

1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:41.513
pay for everything with cash.
That way, Mike can't track us.

1:03:44.255 --> 1:03:46.213
I'm hungry, Mama.

1:03:46.344 --> 1:03:47.736
Sorry, sweetie. We are, too.
Don't worry.

1:03:47.867 --> 1:03:50.478
We were just waiting
for you to wake up.

1:03:50.565 --> 1:03:51.958
What happened to your eye, Mama?

1:03:52.089 --> 1:03:54.004
It was just an accident, buddy.

1:04:01.446 --> 1:04:04.536
Um, Raymond? Yeah. Hi.
It's Dolly's daughter, Paige.

1:04:04.666 --> 1:04:07.060
Yeah.
She said that you'd be callin'.

1:04:07.191 --> 1:04:10.107
So, do you want to come up north
for a visit, then?

1:04:10.237 --> 1:04:14.154
Yeah, yeah. As soon as possible.

1:04:14.285 --> 1:04:16.548
We need to disappear for a bit.

1:04:16.678 --> 1:04:18.550
Well, I live outside
a small town

1:04:18.637 --> 1:04:22.206
in the middle of nowhere,
so if you want to disappear,

1:04:22.293 --> 1:04:24.338
this is the place to do it.

1:04:24.469 --> 1:04:26.079
Stay as long as you need.

1:04:26.210 --> 1:04:29.039
I know some people
who can get you work,

1:04:29.126 --> 1:04:32.520
and there's plenty of odd jobs
around here that need doing.

1:04:32.607 --> 1:04:35.088
That's amazing.

1:04:35.219 --> 1:04:37.264
I hear you might need
some other things.

1:04:37.351 --> 1:04:38.787
Uh, yeah.

1:04:38.875 --> 1:04:41.181
We need to get across
the border.

1:04:41.312 --> 1:04:42.879
- You have passports?
- Yes.

1:04:43.009 --> 1:04:44.663
You'll need signed letters

1:04:44.793 --> 1:04:48.188
from the father saying it's okay
to take the kids across,

1:04:48.275 --> 1:04:49.886
but don't worry. I have a friend

1:04:50.016 --> 1:04:53.063
who's pretty good
at that sort of thing.

1:04:53.193 --> 1:04:57.981
But it is going to look weird
if they both have the same dad,

1:04:58.111 --> 1:05:01.549
so I'll get him to make a letter
for each kid.

1:05:01.636 --> 1:05:03.900
We'll overnight them to you
as soon as you get an address

1:05:04.030 --> 1:05:05.945
and e-mail me
everyone's details.

1:05:06.076 --> 1:05:07.555
Right. Okay.

1:05:10.689 --> 1:05:11.733
Joslyn:
I got you pancakes.

1:05:11.864 --> 1:05:13.126
Thank you.

1:05:13.213 --> 1:05:14.780
I got pancakes, too, Mama.

1:05:14.867 --> 1:05:16.260
You did? Wow.

1:05:16.347 --> 1:05:18.131
Lucky guy.

1:05:18.262 --> 1:05:20.046
That was nice of Auntie Jos
to get you pancakes.

1:05:20.133 --> 1:05:21.787
You were such a brave boy last
night. You really deserve it.

1:05:21.918 --> 1:05:23.789
When's Daddy coming?

1:05:25.138 --> 1:05:26.444
Um...

1:05:28.446 --> 1:05:29.969
He's really busy with work,

1:05:30.056 --> 1:05:32.667
so I'm not sure
when we're going to see him.

1:05:32.754 --> 1:05:36.497
Tanner:
Maybe tomorrow?

1:05:36.628 --> 1:05:37.890
Maybe.

1:05:38.021 --> 1:05:39.718
I think he'll come tomorrow.

1:05:43.200 --> 1:05:44.723
How's Sean doing?

1:05:44.853 --> 1:05:45.898
Are you making sure
he's having a good time?

1:05:45.985 --> 1:05:47.073
Tanner:
Yeah. I was teaching him

1:05:47.204 --> 1:05:48.379
little piggy on his toes.

1:05:48.509 --> 1:05:49.858
You were? Oh, wow.

1:05:49.989 --> 1:05:51.121
He must've loved that.

1:05:51.251 --> 1:05:52.774
Hey.

1:05:52.861 --> 1:05:54.341
You want to watch your show?

1:05:54.428 --> 1:05:55.647
Yeah? Okay.

1:06:01.348 --> 1:06:02.828
So, what's up?

1:06:02.959 --> 1:06:05.962
It's all set.
He lives in Newfoundland.

1:06:08.573 --> 1:06:10.879
- Wow.
- Yeah, yeah.

1:06:11.010 --> 1:06:13.317
We just need to find a place
that we can lay low

1:06:13.404 --> 1:06:15.580
for a few days, just while
he figures some stuff out.

1:06:17.321 --> 1:06:19.410
I think I know somewhere
we can go.

1:06:19.497 --> 1:06:21.325
What? Really?

1:06:21.412 --> 1:06:23.283
My family used to have a cabin.

1:06:23.370 --> 1:06:25.155
I haven't been there in years.

1:06:25.242 --> 1:06:27.113
It's pretty rustic, but it's in
the middle of the woods.

1:06:27.244 --> 1:06:28.506
Sounds perfect.

1:06:31.988 --> 1:06:33.380
What?

1:06:33.511 --> 1:06:36.035
This is a lot.

1:06:36.166 --> 1:06:38.777
- We're moving to Canada now?
- I know. I know.

1:06:40.387 --> 1:06:42.128
We have enough money to survive.

1:06:42.259 --> 1:06:44.087
We'll be far away and safe.

1:06:44.217 --> 1:06:47.220
Wait. What about your mom?
I mean, Mike is--

1:06:47.307 --> 1:06:48.439
No. Don't worry about Mom.

1:06:50.789 --> 1:06:53.444
Thank you.

1:06:53.574 --> 1:06:55.141
She's never let a man
push her around before.

1:06:55.228 --> 1:06:57.143
She's not going to start now.

1:07:05.282 --> 1:07:07.675
- Hey, Dolly.
- Hmm.

1:07:07.762 --> 1:07:09.851
Well, she got you pretty good,
didn't she?

1:07:11.940 --> 1:07:13.290
Where are they?

1:07:13.377 --> 1:07:15.205
Not a clue.

1:07:15.292 --> 1:07:18.208
You must've done something
pretty bad, though, did you?

1:07:18.338 --> 1:07:19.992
Making her go over the edge
like that.

1:07:20.079 --> 1:07:21.385
She didn't even tell me
where she was going,

1:07:21.515 --> 1:07:22.777
but she said you'd probably
be here,

1:07:22.908 --> 1:07:25.258
sniffing around
trying to find her.

1:07:25.345 --> 1:07:26.999
She can't take my family away.
It's against the law.

1:07:28.479 --> 1:07:29.915
She's his mother.

1:07:33.136 --> 1:07:35.573
- Watch your tone, Dolly.
- Oh, yeah?

1:07:37.618 --> 1:07:39.359
You get off my property.

1:07:39.446 --> 1:07:43.146
And If I catch you trespassing
here again,

1:07:43.276 --> 1:07:44.843
I'll blow a hole in you.

1:07:44.973 --> 1:07:48.020
How's my tone now, Mikey?

1:08:20.966 --> 1:08:22.924
Listen, Rex. I don't care
that you're at work.

1:08:23.011 --> 1:08:26.276
Think. Where might have your ex
have gone?

1:08:30.280 --> 1:08:32.585
I will bust your head open
if you don't give me something.

1:08:34.979 --> 1:08:37.504
A cabin, huh?

1:09:06.664 --> 1:09:09.493
Wow. This place is perfect.

1:09:11.015 --> 1:09:13.932
Look at that lake.

1:09:14.062 --> 1:09:15.325
It'll need a bit of clean.

1:09:17.587 --> 1:09:20.199
Mama, there's two bedrooms

1:09:20.286 --> 1:09:21.940
and a tiny toilet.

1:09:22.069 --> 1:09:24.682
There is? Well, why don't you go
pick one out for us?

1:09:28.555 --> 1:09:30.557
We'll have to wait
around here anyway.

1:09:30.644 --> 1:09:32.819
I'll go into town
and get some supplies.

1:09:32.951 --> 1:09:34.648
See if there's anywhere we can
get those documents delivered.

1:09:34.735 --> 1:09:36.520
We'll have to be ready
for anything.

1:10:16.951 --> 1:10:18.779
Doesn't look like
you're just passing through.

1:10:18.866 --> 1:10:22.130
No. We're just staying
for a few days.

1:10:22.261 --> 1:10:23.393
Mm-hmm.

1:10:26.004 --> 1:10:27.701
Um, I need a courier service.
Is there a post office nearby?

1:10:27.788 --> 1:10:28.963
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
You're looking at it.

1:10:29.094 --> 1:10:31.443
Oh. Great.

1:10:31.575 --> 1:10:34.665
Uh, I need a package
delivered here.

1:10:34.752 --> 1:10:36.493
You just give them our address,

1:10:36.623 --> 1:10:38.669
and then we hold on to it
until you come pick it up.

1:10:38.755 --> 1:10:41.193
- Easy-peasy.
- Okay, great.

1:10:41.280 --> 1:10:42.847
- What's your name, darlin'?
- Uh, Paige.

1:10:42.977 --> 1:10:46.023
Well, Paige, I'm Maeve.

1:10:46.111 --> 1:10:47.764
Now, if you don't mind
my saying,

1:10:47.852 --> 1:10:49.549
you seem like you're looking

1:10:49.636 --> 1:10:51.550
not to be found.

1:10:51.682 --> 1:10:54.337
Now, you don't have to worry
about a thing, because if

1:10:54.424 --> 1:10:57.035
whoever gave you that black eye
comes lurking around here,

1:10:57.165 --> 1:10:59.298
I'll send them packing
right back to whatever hole

1:10:59.385 --> 1:11:01.518
they crawled out of.

1:11:01.605 --> 1:11:03.259
Now, that's going to be $75.

1:11:04.956 --> 1:11:07.393
Thanks, Maeve.

1:11:07.523 --> 1:11:09.916
Um, do you sell phones,

1:11:10.004 --> 1:11:11.702
cellphones?

1:11:11.832 --> 1:11:14.182
Oh, no. Sorry. That's much too
high-tech for me.

1:11:14.270 --> 1:11:15.967
No. If I don't understand it,

1:11:16.054 --> 1:11:17.708
I don't sell it.

1:11:17.795 --> 1:11:19.536
Do you have a phone
I could use?

1:11:19.623 --> 1:11:21.233
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
In the back office there.

1:11:21.320 --> 1:11:23.279
- You help yourself.
- Okay, great. Thanks.

1:11:36.030 --> 1:11:39.817
Raymond? I've got an address.

1:12:13.981 --> 1:12:15.679
Paige?

1:12:34.437 --> 1:12:36.177
- Here.
- Thank you.

1:12:39.746 --> 1:12:42.358
Tanner passed out as soon as
his head hit the pillow.

1:12:42.445 --> 1:12:44.055
The baby is still sound asleep.

1:12:47.362 --> 1:12:48.712
When are you going to have
the talk?

1:12:51.062 --> 1:12:53.412
Soon.

1:12:53.499 --> 1:12:54.718
I can't keep lying to him.

1:12:56.763 --> 1:12:59.549
It's going to be hard for Tanner
to understand.

1:12:59.636 --> 1:13:02.769
I know.

1:13:06.686 --> 1:13:08.558
It really is amazing here.

1:13:10.951 --> 1:13:14.302
When I was a kid,
we'd come here a lot.

1:13:14.389 --> 1:13:16.392
I've always remembered
how I felt.

1:13:17.784 --> 1:13:20.787
At peace, free,

1:13:20.874 --> 1:13:22.093
happy.

1:13:26.750 --> 1:13:31.232
I think I could live like this
if I had to.

1:13:31.318 --> 1:13:35.106
You know? If this was it.

1:13:36.934 --> 1:13:39.327
Far from the city, Rex,

1:13:39.458 --> 1:13:42.243
all my problems.

1:13:43.984 --> 1:13:47.118
You could start over.
You could be anybody.

1:13:54.386 --> 1:13:56.344
All right. So, tell me again.

1:13:56.432 --> 1:13:58.651
I run and hide
in the special spot,

1:13:58.737 --> 1:14:00.044
and I don't come out
until you or Auntie Joslyn

1:14:00.130 --> 1:14:01.306
comes and gets us.

1:14:01.393 --> 1:14:02.525
That's right.

1:14:02.655 --> 1:14:03.960
But why, Mom?

1:14:05.615 --> 1:14:07.355
Because, um,

1:14:07.443 --> 1:14:10.532
there are some not-nice people

1:14:10.620 --> 1:14:12.186
who may come looking for us,

1:14:12.273 --> 1:14:14.624
and I just need to make sure
that you are safe.

1:14:14.710 --> 1:14:16.190
What do you mean?

1:14:16.321 --> 1:14:18.454
Why isn't Daddy here
to keep us safe?

1:14:21.239 --> 1:14:23.763
Because, um, Daddy is sick.

1:14:25.373 --> 1:14:26.679
- Sick?
- Yeah.

1:14:26.766 --> 1:14:29.594
He just doesn't know
what he's doing.

1:14:29.726 --> 1:14:32.250
What kind of sick?

1:14:32.337 --> 1:14:34.600
Um, it's like in a movie

1:14:34.687 --> 1:14:37.995
when a good guy
does something naughty

1:14:38.125 --> 1:14:39.518
and it turns him into a bad guy.

1:14:39.605 --> 1:14:42.521
Daddy's the bad guy?

1:14:42.608 --> 1:14:46.394
He's not safe for us
right now, okay?

1:14:46.525 --> 1:14:49.180
Tanner, Tanner,
I know this is so hard.

1:14:51.530 --> 1:14:53.489
I want to go home.

1:14:54.968 --> 1:14:57.797
I know. I know. Me, too.

1:14:57.884 --> 1:14:59.843
But I promise you,

1:14:59.973 --> 1:15:02.106
I will always be here for you.

1:15:02.236 --> 1:15:03.368
I will protect you.

1:15:03.499 --> 1:15:04.804
Okay?

1:15:05.849 --> 1:15:07.546
Okay.

1:15:07.633 --> 1:15:09.026
You want to race back to
the cabin?

1:15:21.865 --> 1:15:23.867
How'd it go?

1:15:26.782 --> 1:15:28.393
How do you convince your son

1:15:28.523 --> 1:15:30.395
that his biggest hero
is now a villain?

1:15:32.876 --> 1:15:35.531
I think I just need to
leave it now

1:15:35.661 --> 1:15:37.184
and just give him some time.

1:15:39.056 --> 1:15:41.362
I'm sorry, Paige. That's tough.

1:15:44.670 --> 1:15:45.844
I'm going to head into town.

1:15:45.932 --> 1:15:48.065
See if those documents are done.

1:15:48.152 --> 1:15:50.546
You going to be okay here
on your own?

1:15:50.633 --> 1:15:52.764
I'll play a game or something
with Tanner.

1:15:52.852 --> 1:15:54.637
Try and cheer him up.

1:15:54.724 --> 1:15:55.942
Okay.

1:15:56.073 --> 1:15:58.075
I won't be long.

1:16:20.793 --> 1:16:22.186
Oh, hi, darling.

1:16:22.273 --> 1:16:23.361
There's a message for you
out back.

1:16:23.448 --> 1:16:25.406
Oh, great. Thanks.

1:16:36.460 --> 1:16:38.419
Hey, Raymond.

1:16:38.550 --> 1:16:41.379
Paige, the letters are ready.
Everything looks great.

1:16:41.509 --> 1:16:43.163
I'll send them off today.

1:16:43.294 --> 1:16:45.339
- Probably arrive tomorrow.
- That's wonderful.

1:16:45.425 --> 1:16:47.037
And you shouldn't have
any trouble

1:16:47.124 --> 1:16:50.388
if you cross at Houlton.
It's a sleepy border.

1:16:50.475 --> 1:16:52.520
The guy who runs
the booth is about to retire,

1:16:52.608 --> 1:16:56.568
and he's probably not interested
in his job anymore.

1:16:56.699 --> 1:16:57.916
I cannot thank you enough.

1:16:58.004 --> 1:16:59.527
No problem, honey.

1:16:59.657 --> 1:17:01.965
Let's just get you
over that border, okay?

1:17:05.098 --> 1:17:07.535
Thanks, Maeve.
Um, do you have bullets

1:17:07.666 --> 1:17:10.451
for a sporting rifle?

1:17:10.582 --> 1:17:12.496
What, you mean, like, a .22?

1:17:14.107 --> 1:17:15.630
Yeah.

1:17:28.425 --> 1:17:31.124
Touchdown!

1:17:31.210 --> 1:17:33.170
So, Teddy, how was that?

1:17:46.096 --> 1:17:48.315
Shh-shh-shh.

1:17:48.402 --> 1:17:50.013
Where's Tanner?

1:17:51.405 --> 1:17:52.842
He's playing somewhere.

1:17:55.758 --> 1:17:56.846
And how's my baby boy, huh?

1:17:58.499 --> 1:17:59.849
Aw.

1:18:01.807 --> 1:18:03.548
Mommy Bear protecting her cub.

1:18:03.635 --> 1:18:06.986
He'll never be yours.

1:18:07.073 --> 1:18:10.555
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

1:18:12.688 --> 1:18:14.646
You two
were really stupid enough

1:18:14.777 --> 1:18:17.170
to think that
you could get away with this.

1:18:17.257 --> 1:18:18.432
Taking my money

1:18:18.519 --> 1:18:21.697
and my boys.

1:18:21.784 --> 1:18:24.395
My legacy.

1:18:24.525 --> 1:18:26.919
I will find you
wherever you go.

1:18:27.005 --> 1:18:28.138
I will haunt you

1:18:28.225 --> 1:18:30.706
like a ghost.

1:18:33.665 --> 1:18:35.754
You've ruined my life!

1:18:35.885 --> 1:18:36.973
And now, you're going to pay,
witch.

1:18:37.059 --> 1:18:38.235
Daddy?

1:18:42.152 --> 1:18:44.197
Hey, buddy.

1:18:44.327 --> 1:18:46.286
Oh, I missed you so much.

1:18:46.416 --> 1:18:47.940
You having fun out here?

1:18:48.071 --> 1:18:49.898
What are you doing
to Auntie Joslyn?

1:18:50.029 --> 1:18:52.118
We're just having a little talk.

1:18:52.205 --> 1:18:53.641
Mommy was right.

1:18:53.728 --> 1:18:55.208
What's that, buddy?

1:18:55.295 --> 1:18:57.384
You're a bad guy.

1:18:57.471 --> 1:18:58.734
No, no. That's not true.

1:18:58.864 --> 1:19:01.171
You know
how much Daddy loves you.

1:19:01.258 --> 1:19:03.085
Mommy is a liar.

1:19:03.173 --> 1:19:05.741
Run, Tanner!

1:19:05.871 --> 1:19:07.351
Run like Mommy told you. Run!

1:19:07.438 --> 1:19:09.092
Argh!

1:19:16.925 --> 1:19:18.536
Tanner?

1:19:18.623 --> 1:19:19.929
Where are you, buddy?

1:19:20.016 --> 1:19:22.540
Come talk to me. I can explain.

1:19:22.627 --> 1:19:23.846
Where is my wife?

1:19:23.933 --> 1:19:25.325
She went into town.

1:19:25.456 --> 1:19:27.023
If I don't call her
every 10 minutes,

1:19:27.153 --> 1:19:28.719
she'll know something's wrong
and call the police.

1:19:28.807 --> 1:19:30.112
Liar!

1:19:30.243 --> 1:19:31.897
There is no cell service
out here.

1:19:31.984 --> 1:19:33.202
Now, where is she?

1:19:33.290 --> 1:19:36.032
I told you, she went to town.

1:19:36.162 --> 1:19:37.294
To get supplies.

1:20:17.377 --> 1:20:18.814
Tanner?

1:20:20.684 --> 1:20:23.383
Come see Daddy.

1:20:36.005 --> 1:20:37.267
Tanner?

1:20:37.353 --> 1:20:40.531
- Tanner!
- Mama.

1:20:40.661 --> 1:20:42.880
Are you okay? Are you okay?

1:20:42.968 --> 1:20:46.493
Okay.
Do you know where they went?

1:20:46.580 --> 1:20:50.106
Okay. Um, you remember
what I told you to do, right?

1:20:50.193 --> 1:20:52.804
You stay here
and you be very, very quiet,

1:20:52.891 --> 1:20:54.240
and only come out

1:20:54.371 --> 1:20:56.764
if Auntie Joslyn
or I come and get you.

1:20:56.852 --> 1:20:58.853
Mama, I'm scared.
Please don't leave me.

1:20:58.941 --> 1:21:02.509
Shh, sweetie.
Be brave, okay, sweetie?

1:21:02.596 --> 1:21:04.555
You need to be
a brave bear, all right?

1:21:04.684 --> 1:21:08.559
I promise you, it'll be okay.

1:21:08.646 --> 1:21:10.213
All right? I won't be long.
I will come back.

1:21:11.344 --> 1:21:12.519
Here.

1:21:12.606 --> 1:21:13.869
Teddy will keep you safe.

1:21:21.485 --> 1:21:24.443
I love you so much.

1:21:24.575 --> 1:21:26.838
I don't know
what I would do without you.

1:21:26.925 --> 1:21:28.405
Michael:
Tanner?

1:21:29.580 --> 1:21:30.755
Stay here.

1:21:49.339 --> 1:21:51.036
Please, Michael. Stop this.

1:21:51.123 --> 1:21:52.907
Just shut up!

1:21:52.995 --> 1:21:55.171
Please just let me go back
and get the baby.

1:21:55.258 --> 1:21:56.955
- He can't be there alone.
- He will be fine.

1:21:57.041 --> 1:21:58.696
As soon as I find Tanner,
I'll grab Sean and I'll go.

1:21:58.782 --> 1:22:00.741
He's mine. You can't have him.

1:22:00.871 --> 1:22:02.612
These are my boys and my family.

1:22:02.700 --> 1:22:04.397
- You have no part in it!
- I won't let you take him.

1:22:04.484 --> 1:22:05.964
Shut up. Shut up!

1:22:06.094 --> 1:22:07.487
Shut up!

1:22:07.574 --> 1:22:09.489
You'll never find him.

1:22:09.620 --> 1:22:12.318
Where is Tanner?

1:22:12.405 --> 1:22:15.407
You have some sort of
escape plan, huh?

1:22:15.495 --> 1:22:17.541
Where is he?

1:22:17.671 --> 1:22:19.891
Voice: Don't worry.
I'll be your best friend.

1:22:20.022 --> 1:22:23.677
And remember, you should always
be a brave bear.

1:22:26.419 --> 1:22:27.638
Voice:
I'll be your best friend.

1:22:27.768 --> 1:22:31.120
And remember,
always be a brave bear.

1:22:44.568 --> 1:22:45.960
Oh, you're dead.

1:23:13.075 --> 1:23:14.728
Tanner, Tanner!

1:23:14.859 --> 1:23:16.425
Oh, Tanner, why?

1:23:16.513 --> 1:23:18.080
Why, why, why,
would you do that? It's Daddy.

1:23:18.210 --> 1:23:20.038
Mommy attacked me, okay?
You saw that, right?

1:23:20.125 --> 1:23:21.692
Mommy? Mommy is crazy.

1:23:21.779 --> 1:23:24.129
You're bad! Mommy, help!

1:23:24.216 --> 1:23:26.349
Tanner, run!

1:23:29.439 --> 1:23:30.962
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:23:31.049 --> 1:23:32.702
Wait.

1:23:36.707 --> 1:23:39.492
Tanner, Tanner, Tanner.
I love you, buddy.

1:23:39.579 --> 1:23:42.887
Oof!

1:23:42.974 --> 1:23:44.410
You son of a witch.

1:23:46.108 --> 1:23:49.111
Are you okay? Are you okay?

1:23:49.198 --> 1:23:51.026
I'm okay, Mama. I'm okay.

1:23:51.112 --> 1:23:54.116
Paige: Okay, okay.
The baby. Go. Go get him.

1:23:54.246 --> 1:23:55.334
Get some rope!

1:23:58.772 --> 1:24:00.252
Was I brave, Mama?

1:24:00.383 --> 1:24:02.210
You were so brave.
Sweetie, you did great.

1:24:05.952 --> 1:24:07.737
Detective: I'm sorry
we couldn't have acted sooner.

1:24:07.868 --> 1:24:09.261
Vice looked into your husband,

1:24:09.348 --> 1:24:11.307
and it turns out
he was brokering a deal

1:24:11.394 --> 1:24:15.224
between the Chinese and the
biker gang led by Roman D'Mante.

1:24:15.311 --> 1:24:16.312
Michael: You're not going to
get away with this, Paige.

1:24:16.442 --> 1:24:18.314
You kidnapped my kid.

1:24:18.401 --> 1:24:19.793
I just came to get him back.
It's my right as a father!

1:24:19.924 --> 1:24:21.752
I didn't do anything.

1:24:24.755 --> 1:24:26.670
Your husband disappeared
with all the money

1:24:26.757 --> 1:24:29.412
right before the deal went down,
and everything went sideways.

1:24:31.588 --> 1:24:34.721
Is your friend going to be okay?
She looks a little beat-up.

1:24:37.681 --> 1:24:39.987
Yeah. Yeah. She'll be okay.

1:24:40.075 --> 1:24:41.772
She's as tough as they come.

1:24:43.600 --> 1:24:46.690
We found your husband's car
down the road,

1:24:46.820 --> 1:24:48.083
There was no money in it.

1:24:50.215 --> 1:24:53.305
You say you have no idea
about any of this?

1:24:53.392 --> 1:24:55.655
No.

1:24:55.742 --> 1:24:57.570
No. After I came to you,
we decided

1:24:57.701 --> 1:25:00.312
it was safer if we just
came here to get away from him.

1:25:00.443 --> 1:25:02.227
Yeah.

1:25:02.358 --> 1:25:05.535
Well, there's going to be
a lot of dangerous men

1:25:05.621 --> 1:25:07.580
looking for that money.

1:25:07.666 --> 1:25:09.321
Whoever does have it,

1:25:09.452 --> 1:25:11.584
I hope they know
what they're doing.

1:25:13.412 --> 1:25:15.110
Thanks, detective.

1:25:31.213 --> 1:25:33.128
Tanner:
Is Daddy going to jail, Mama?

1:25:35.347 --> 1:25:36.827
I don't know, buddy...

1:25:40.178 --> 1:25:41.527
...but I think so.

1:26:15.344 --> 1:26:16.867
Tanner?
The food's ready. Come on.

1:26:31.664 --> 1:26:33.362
Does you want a present? Okay.
