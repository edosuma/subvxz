01:04.084 --> 01:08.251
<i>(Marla): Once upon a time,
there was an 18-year-old human,</i>

01:08.417 --> 01:10.251
<i>uh...</i>

01:10.417 --> 01:14.292
Oh, come on, Marla, just...
just be normal. Just be normal.

01:14.459 --> 01:16.667
There comes a time
in every young person's life...

01:16.834 --> 01:18.626
Not "person."
That sounds too formal.

01:18.792 --> 01:21.709
Girl. No, not girl.

01:21.876 --> 01:23.251
Woman.

01:23.417 --> 01:26.126
There comes a time
in every young woman's life

01:26.292 --> 01:28.209
when she has to make a decision.

01:28.376 --> 01:29.751
Okay, um...

01:29.917 --> 01:31.584
Look, Mom and Dad,

01:31.751 --> 01:33.501
obviously I want to go to college,

01:33.667 --> 01:36.584
education is the most important
thing in the world, but...

01:36.751 --> 01:39.334
after 12 years of school,

01:39.501 --> 01:42.042
think about how valuable
it will be for me

01:42.209 --> 01:44.167
to actually experience the world.

01:45.251 --> 01:46.709
As Amelia Earhart once said:

01:46.876 --> 01:49.042
"Adventure is worthwhile in itself."

01:50.126 --> 01:51.501
Which is why... (chuckling)

01:51.667 --> 01:53.792
I got...

01:53.959 --> 01:55.751
- ...this!
- (knocking)

01:55.917 --> 01:58.209
- (door opening)
- What's in your pocket?

01:58.376 --> 02:00.001
- What? Nothing.

02:00.167 --> 02:01.542
- If you don't tell me,

02:01.709 --> 02:03.876
I'll tell Mom you gave me
ice cream for dinner.

02:04.042 --> 02:06.167
- Wow! Blackmail.

02:06.334 --> 02:09.334
- Impressive, but illegal.
- Not when you're six.

02:09.501 --> 02:11.542
- Alright, you have
to promise not to tell

02:11.709 --> 02:13.167
Mom and Dad until I've told them.

02:13.334 --> 02:14.876
Pinky swear?

02:15.042 --> 02:16.417
- Pinky swear.

02:18.959 --> 02:22.417
- Do you know what this is?
- A really small notebook?

02:22.584 --> 02:25.126
- It's a passport. It lets you
go anywhere in the world.

02:25.292 --> 02:28.209
I've saved up all my work money
and I'm gonna backpack everywhere.

02:28.376 --> 02:30.459
And then I'll go to college. It's just...

02:31.959 --> 02:35.001
I don't know, Mom and Dad make
everything so easy for us, you know?

02:35.167 --> 02:37.126
Sometimes, you gotta test yourself.

02:37.292 --> 02:39.417
- But you take lots of tests.

02:39.584 --> 02:42.626
- No, not those kind of tests.
Real-life tests.

02:42.792 --> 02:44.584
Where you go everywhere,

02:44.751 --> 02:47.667
and do everything, and see
what you're really made of.

02:53.542 --> 02:56.876
I get to be an explorer.
A "never before her."

02:57.042 --> 02:58.626
A crosser of borders.

02:58.792 --> 03:00.834

05:22.501 --> 05:27.792
Could it be...
Marla, the noble knight? Hi-yah!

05:27.959 --> 05:30.126
Stay away from my brother!

05:30.292 --> 05:32.584
Is it time for the super...

05:32.751 --> 05:35.001
(both):...duo slingshot?!

05:35.167 --> 05:37.167
- Whoa...!

05:37.334 --> 05:38.917
Hi-yah! Ha!

05:39.084 --> 05:42.626
Catch me, Charlie, catch me!
We saved the day!

05:42.792 --> 05:44.167
(both): Viking and knight!

05:44.334 --> 05:46.751
Viking and knight! Viking and knight!

05:46.917 --> 05:48.959
Viking and knight!
Viking and knight!

05:49.126 --> 05:52.417
- (doorbell ringing)
- Hey, Charlie, don't open the door!

05:55.959 --> 05:58.251
- (doorbell ringing)
- Alright, I'm coming!

06:06.167 --> 06:07.667
- Marla Brenner?

06:08.709 --> 06:10.126
- Yes.

06:10.292 --> 06:13.084
- I'm sorry,
but there's been an accident.

06:17.167 --> 06:19.667
Could we please come inside
and speak with you?

06:30.167 --> 06:32.917
(voice fading): Your parents
were in a car accident...

06:42.251 --> 06:43.876
- Marla, you're not listening to me!

06:44.042 --> 06:47.292
- Charlie, I am listening to you,
but the answer is still no!

06:47.459 --> 06:50.626
- So you're bailing on me again?
Fine. Then I'll just go with Danny.

06:50.792 --> 06:53.001
- Ha! To the city? I don't think so.

06:53.167 --> 06:54.917
- You always do this!

06:56.667 --> 06:59.292
- Hey! I am trying
to run a household here.

06:59.459 --> 07:01.834
- That doesn't mean
we can't have any fun!

07:02.001 --> 07:05.126
- Yeah, well, sometimes, there are
more important things than fun.

07:06.167 --> 07:08.209
- This sucks!
- Language!

07:08.376 --> 07:10.751
- And don't you dare...
- (door slamming)

07:11.959 --> 07:13.417
...slam the door.

07:13.584 --> 07:16.376
(door slamming repeatedly)

07:17.459 --> 07:18.917
Good!

07:19.959 --> 07:21.584
That went great!

07:56.042 --> 07:57.876
(beeping)

08:00.459 --> 08:02.292
Charlie, dinner's ready.

08:06.376 --> 08:08.917
- (knocking)
- Come on. Bud, let's talk.

08:22.792 --> 08:24.376
Charlie!

08:31.251 --> 08:32.751
- Sorry.

08:34.417 --> 08:37.751
Oh, hey, Danny. Uh...
Yeah, I'm on my way now.

08:38.792 --> 08:41.792
(sighing) Sorry. Uh, not too long.

08:41.958 --> 08:44.459
Yeah, can you hold on a minute?

08:45.542 --> 08:49.417
Danny? Yeah, my sister
was totally cool with it.

08:50.584 --> 08:52.209
Uh...yeah, I'm close.

08:52.376 --> 08:55.334
I think, like, 10 minutes.

08:55.501 --> 08:56.834
(thunder crashing)

09:04.542 --> 09:06.417
- Make that 20.

09:15.792 --> 09:18.209
- Come on, Charlie,
pick up the phone!

09:18.376 --> 09:19.917
(groaning)

09:23.584 --> 09:26.667
Midtown?!
Argh! Are you kidding me?!

09:50.501 --> 09:53.876
- Hey, whoa! Lady!
You can't go in there.

09:54.042 --> 09:57.167
- Trust me, mister,
I am not here for the Gateway to Fun.

09:57.334 --> 09:59.459
My little brother is in there,
I have to find him

09:59.626 --> 10:01.542
so I can tell him
he's grounded till he's 18.

10:01.709 --> 10:03.084
- Yeah, okay, let's go.
- Thank you!

10:03.251 --> 10:07.042
- No, I said let's go, you know, together.
She's gonna make me run!

10:11.209 --> 10:12.751
- Whoa.

10:27.584 --> 10:29.167
Charlie?

10:44.459 --> 10:46.709
(Charlie): This is so awesome!

10:49.042 --> 10:51.792
- Charlie? Charlie!

10:51.959 --> 10:53.667
- Marla!
- What were you thinking?!

10:53.834 --> 10:56.042
- How did you find me?
- You scared me half to death.

10:56.209 --> 10:59.417
- I'm sorry, but you won't believe this!
You have to check this out!

10:59.584 --> 11:03.209
- Charlie, we're leaving.
- No! Wait! Marla!

11:03.376 --> 11:06.251
It's all lined up exactly like we had it.

11:06.417 --> 11:09.084
There's the Coliseum
and all the knights.

11:09.251 --> 11:11.417
Remember? What are...
what are the chances?

11:11.584 --> 11:13.709
- Look, any minute now,
a rent-a-cop is gonna come

11:13.876 --> 11:16.001
through that curtain
and arrest us for trespassing.

11:16.167 --> 11:19.626
- Come on! Look around!

11:20.667 --> 11:23.042
It's like we're meant to be here.

11:23.209 --> 11:25.042
- Meant to be here?
That's ridiculous.

11:25.209 --> 11:27.876
- What is wrong with you?
- Excuse me?

11:28.042 --> 11:30.751
- You used to talk about adventures
and seeing the world.

11:30.917 --> 11:33.709
"Nothing's worse
than a small, stationary life?"

11:33.876 --> 11:35.792
- But I grew up, Charlie.

11:35.959 --> 11:38.209
And I learned the hard way
that life is not an adventure.

11:38.376 --> 11:41.251
It's full of disappointments
and it's not the way you want it to be.

11:42.292 --> 11:43.709
- That's just how you made it

11:43.876 --> 11:47.251
because you don't do anything,
you won't let me do anything!

11:48.959 --> 11:51.709
It's like ever since Mom and Dad died...

11:51.876 --> 11:54.126
- Don't, Charlie.

11:54.292 --> 11:55.792
...you died.

11:55.959 --> 11:58.417
And now we're just
pretending to be a family.

12:01.709 --> 12:04.376
- Well, then, I guess you're just
stuck with dead old me.

12:04.542 --> 12:07.167
Come on, let's go.

12:09.709 --> 12:11.084
- No!

12:11.251 --> 12:15.626
Wait. There's even a spot here...
for my Viking!

12:15.792 --> 12:18.001
- No, there's not, Charlie!

12:18.167 --> 12:21.292
This is not for us! This is a toy!

12:21.459 --> 12:24.417
It's a stupid toy,
and none of this means anything!

12:30.209 --> 12:32.667
- (disembodied cackling)
- (rumbling)

12:33.917 --> 12:35.751
(disembodied laughter)

12:37.959 --> 12:40.001
I think something bad's happening.

12:43.167 --> 12:45.001
- Or something good.

12:46.792 --> 12:48.834
Whoa!

12:49.001 --> 12:51.501
(epic music)

12:59.792 --> 13:02.626
- No.
- It's magic!

13:02.792 --> 13:04.251
Marla, look!

13:06.084 --> 13:08.376
- Look.
- No, no...

13:09.626 --> 13:12.334
- Whoa!
- (laughing)

13:19.084 --> 13:20.792
- Charlie!

13:22.959 --> 13:24.917
Oh...my...

13:29.167 --> 13:31.126
No! Charlie, don't!

13:31.292 --> 13:32.709
(crackling)

13:35.876 --> 13:40.626
(screaming)

13:40.792 --> 13:42.251
(exclaiming) Whoa!

13:42.417 --> 13:43.959
Oh...! Son of a...

13:44.126 --> 13:46.751
Whoa! Ow! Ah! Oof!

13:49.001 --> 13:51.584
(groaning) Ah!

13:51.751 --> 13:53.792
Whoa-oh-oh! Ow!

13:53.959 --> 13:55.751
(grunting)

13:57.959 --> 14:00.251
(exclaiming softly, groaning)

14:00.417 --> 14:02.334
Ah! (grunting)

14:03.459 --> 14:05.167
(grunting)

14:05.334 --> 14:07.167
Huh. Oh.

14:07.334 --> 14:09.667
- (birdsong)
- Ah...huh?

14:11.667 --> 14:13.709
(screaming)

14:13.876 --> 14:17.376
Huh? Huh? (whimpering)

14:17.542 --> 14:19.001
- Whoa!
- Charlie?

14:19.167 --> 14:21.292
- What the...?
- I'm coming! Hang on!

14:21.459 --> 14:24.792
Whoa! Oh! Okay, Marla! (grunting)

14:24.959 --> 14:27.417
Left, right, left...

14:27.584 --> 14:29.417
Whoa! Oh!

14:29.584 --> 14:31.042
- Charlie?
- Wha...

14:31.209 --> 14:33.792
- Ah!
- Ah...wow.

14:35.167 --> 14:37.542
- (Marla gasping)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:37.709 --> 14:40.834
Easy, tough guy.
Just looking for my brother.

14:41.001 --> 14:43.542
- (laughing) That tickles! Stop!

14:43.709 --> 14:45.292
(laughing) Marla, it's me.

14:45.459 --> 14:48.792
- Oh...huh?
- You look weird. Where are we?

14:48.959 --> 14:50.542
- Oh...
- What's going on?

14:50.709 --> 14:53.334
- Charlie?!
- Yeah, Marla.

14:53.501 --> 14:55.584
- You're not...you.

14:55.751 --> 14:57.876
- I know! I feel different!

14:58.042 --> 15:00.542
- Yeah...you look different.

15:00.709 --> 15:02.417
You have a...a beard!

15:02.584 --> 15:04.542
- Ha! I do!

15:04.709 --> 15:06.959
- And tattoos!
- Tattoos?!

15:07.126 --> 15:08.334
Cool.

15:08.501 --> 15:11.084
- What's happening?!
- The lighthouse!

15:11.251 --> 15:12.876
The Vikings. All of it.

15:13.042 --> 15:15.417
It's...it's real!

15:15.584 --> 15:17.126
- We're actually here!
- (Marla exclaiming)

15:17.292 --> 15:19.292
- Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Oh, my...
- The lighthouse?

15:19.459 --> 15:21.292
- The lighthouse? The lighthouse!
- Cool!

15:21.459 --> 15:24.459
That's it! We came through
the lighthouse to get here.

15:24.626 --> 15:26.167
- Marla?
- So that must be the way back!

15:26.334 --> 15:27.751
- Of course!
- Marla?

15:27.917 --> 15:29.501
- That's how these magic
things work, isn't it?

15:29.667 --> 15:31.167
- Marla?!
- Now, how do we get up there?

15:31.334 --> 15:34.334
- (horn blowing)
- What the...?

15:43.917 --> 15:46.167
(screaming)

15:47.626 --> 15:50.001
(all roaring)

15:50.167 --> 15:51.542
- Whoa! That's...

16:04.417 --> 16:05.667

16:05.834 --> 16:08.376

16:19.834 --> 16:21.751
(whimpering and exclaiming)

16:21.917 --> 16:24.209
- Excuse me!
Are you guys the good guys?

16:24.376 --> 16:26.084
Never mind, I'll just follow you.

16:26.251 --> 16:29.001
- Ah! What's going on?!

16:29.167 --> 16:31.959
- (grunting)
- (groaning)

16:32.126 --> 16:36.001
Don't worry, Charlie, I'm coming! Oh!

16:36.167 --> 16:37.917
- Marla?

16:38.084 --> 16:40.251
- Marla? Whoops. Sorry. Ah!
- Oh!

16:40.417 --> 16:43.834
- I didn't mean to. Sorry, sir.
- (Viking roaring)

16:44.001 --> 16:45.292
Whoops! My bad. Excuse me.

16:45.459 --> 16:47.459
- I'm not scared of you!
- Ah!

16:47.626 --> 16:49.542
- Changed my mind!

16:56.542 --> 16:58.667
- (Charlie laughing)
- Mommy!

16:58.834 --> 17:00.167
- (Charlie): Yes!
- What?

17:00.334 --> 17:02.501
- I've got my super strength! (laughing)

17:02.667 --> 17:04.334
- Oh...!

- Whoa-oh-oh! This is amazing!

17:10.751 --> 17:12.791
- Do it again, lad! Yah!

17:12.959 --> 17:14.251
- Oh!

17:17.166 --> 17:18.459
- Amazing.

17:18.626 --> 17:21.626
- I'll take that! (laughing)

17:28.959 --> 17:31.584
- (cheering)
- Retreat, lads! Retreat!

17:31.751 --> 17:33.667
(all roaring)

17:36.251 --> 17:37.959

- You.

17:38.126 --> 17:39.501
- Me?

17:39.667 --> 17:41.251
- What be thy name, warrior?

17:41.417 --> 17:43.876
- Um...Charlie.

17:44.042 --> 17:45.376
- (birds chirping)

17:45.542 --> 17:47.709
- I thought your voice
would be a little deeper.

17:47.876 --> 17:51.001
Oh, no matter.
Charles the Destroyer.

17:51.167 --> 17:54.667
Tonight we feast in your honor!

17:54.834 --> 17:58.584
- (cheering)
- Really? A feast? For me?

17:58.751 --> 18:01.001
That's so cool!

<i>(emperor): Hello?!

18:10.209 --> 18:13.626
<i>- Somebody get the IT guys. Is this on?</i>
- Ahoy, Emperor.

18:13.792 --> 18:15.709
- What's taking
you idiot pirates so long?!

18:15.876 --> 18:18.084
I could've captured
an entire Viking horde myself

18:18.251 --> 18:20.167
and been home for dessert by now!

18:20.334 --> 18:23.001
- I think we found
just what you be lookin' for.

18:23.167 --> 18:24.751
<i>- I'm not paying you to think!</i>

18:24.917 --> 18:28.834
I'm paying you to bring me back
the strongest, fiercest, nastiest

18:29.001 --> 18:30.917
<i>Viking warrior you can find!</i>

18:31.084 --> 18:33.792
And make it quick!
Okay, you cretins?!

18:33.959 --> 18:36.834

18:44.042 --> 18:46.584
- Quiet, all of ya!
It'd be decided then.

18:46.751 --> 18:48.584
We found our treasure.

18:48.751 --> 18:51.626
And it be that impressive Viking.

Man who is clearly ignoring me.

19:25.667 --> 19:29.001
I think it goes better with the tattoos
and this giant axe, don't you?

22:38.542 --> 22:41.001
it is Del, your buddy, callin'.

22:41.167 --> 22:43.251
Heh. With the truck.

22:43.417 --> 22:45.376
We've met many times!

22:45.542 --> 22:48.417
Yes, yes! I got a beard, yeah!
(laughing)

22:48.584 --> 22:51.084
Anyway, listen, what if I told you

22:51.251 --> 22:55.792
I had an incredible opportunity
on some rare enchanted hay.

22:55.959 --> 22:58.792
- Huh! I'm coming for you, Charlie!

22:58.959 --> 23:00.584
Yah! Giddy-up!

23:00.751 --> 23:03.042
- So how much can I put you down for?
Let's crunch some numbers.

23:03.209 --> 23:06.584
- Hey, watch it! Watch...
(screaming)

23:06.751 --> 23:08.542
- I don't want no trouble!

23:08.709 --> 23:10.126
- No!

23:10.292 --> 23:12.626
- At that price,
I'm practically paying you.

23:12.792 --> 23:16.709
Oh, hold on. I'm getting another call.
Someone probably wanting hay.

23:17.751 --> 23:20.167
Del's Enchanted Hay. This is Del.

23:20.334 --> 23:22.792
<i>- Del!</i>
- Glinara!

23:22.959 --> 23:24.542
What a surprise.

23:24.709 --> 23:26.917
<i>- We need to talk! Now!</i>
- You sound angry, Glinara.

23:27.084 --> 23:28.751
<i>- I want my money!</i>

23:28.917 --> 23:31.042
- What a coincidence.
I'm just happened to be on my way

23:31.209 --> 23:33.292
to pick up your money right now,
it's great.

23:33.459 --> 23:35.709
- Oh!
- My dogs are going crazy!

23:35.876 --> 23:38.334
- Get outta here!
- I need to borrow this! Ah! Oof!

23:39.376 --> 23:41.167
- Oh, that's my pole!
- Come on!

23:41.334 --> 23:44.251
- I gotta feed my kids with that! Come on!
- Oh! Ouch! Oh!

23:44.417 --> 23:46.626
- (exclaiming)
- (honking)

23:46.792 --> 23:50.001
- Oof! Ah! Oh! Oh! Argh!

23:51.251 --> 23:53.459
- But this truck is all I have!

23:53.626 --> 23:56.501
You can't just send someone
to take my...

23:56.667 --> 23:59.792
- Ah! Outta the way!
(panting) I'm taking the truck.

23:59.959 --> 24:01.626
- What?! N-n-n-no!
- Give me that!

24:01.792 --> 24:03.167
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Stop it!

24:03.334 --> 24:06.126
- Tell Glinara I need more time!
Please!

24:06.292 --> 24:08.917
Who do you think you are?!

24:09.084 --> 24:12.292
Why are you doing this to me?!
Don't hurt Del's Belle!

24:12.459 --> 24:15.417
- You're going to make us crash!
- It's my truck, lady!

24:15.584 --> 24:17.667
- I got enough troubles! Ow!
- Move your foot! Aha!

24:17.834 --> 24:20.001
- Whoa! Ah! What are you... Ugh!

24:20.167 --> 24:22.709
- Go! Go! Fast! Oh!

24:22.876 --> 24:24.917
Faster! Go! Come on!

24:25.084 --> 24:28.917
Oh! What?! No!
No, no, no, no, no, no!

24:29.084 --> 24:33.084
Where did they go?!
Where did they... Charlie!

24:35.667 --> 24:37.792
- (horns honking)
- Charlie?!

24:40.167 --> 24:41.626
Oh...

24:41.792 --> 24:44.001
I've...I've lost him.

24:44.167 --> 24:45.792
- Joyride's over!

24:45.959 --> 24:48.501
You clearly don't work for Glinara.

24:48.667 --> 24:52.667
And this is my truck, lady!
Have a nice life!

24:52.834 --> 24:55.501
I'm saying that sarcastically!

24:56.542 --> 24:58.167
- Ah!

24:58.334 --> 25:00.459
(exclaiming) Argh!

25:00.626 --> 25:02.584
Grrr! What the heck?!

25:02.751 --> 25:05.167
What is going on
in this crazy place?

25:05.334 --> 25:07.126
- (sighing)
- (horse snorting)

25:10.084 --> 25:11.292
Oh!

25:11.459 --> 25:13.959
Oh, thank goodness you're back.

25:15.334 --> 25:18.667
Look, I realize
we got off to a bad start,

25:18.834 --> 25:22.209
and that I need you more
than you need me...

25:22.376 --> 25:24.417
- (neighing)
- (exclaiming)

25:24.584 --> 25:26.709
Ah! Oh!

25:29.751 --> 25:31.417
Ah...

25:31.584 --> 25:34.126
Huh. Alright.

25:34.292 --> 25:37.626
Okay. I just need to find some help.

25:44.542 --> 25:46.917
Perfect. (sighing)

25:53.334 --> 25:55.376
(sighing)

25:55.542 --> 25:57.792
- (bell tolling)
- Huh?

25:57.959 --> 26:00.376
Ah! Oh!

26:00.542 --> 26:03.001
(bell tolling)

26:03.167 --> 26:04.917
(neighing)

26:08.417 --> 26:10.126
(banjo playing)

26:13.626 --> 26:15.292
Hello?

26:18.959 --> 26:20.459
Oh! (coughing)

26:22.917 --> 26:25.001
Huh.

26:26.334 --> 26:28.459
- Guess not.
- (cowboy laughing)

26:28.626 --> 26:31.792
- No! Not a darn-tootin' nugget
of gold today!

26:31.959 --> 26:34.167
- (horse snorting)
- What? Well, yeah, I agree!

26:34.334 --> 26:35.959
- Uh, sir? Excuse me?

26:36.126 --> 26:38.001
Can I help you with
something, little lady?

26:38.167 --> 26:40.792
- Yeah! Any idea where
I can find the sher...

26:40.959 --> 26:43.334
- (gunshot)
- Yee-haw!

26:43.501 --> 26:45.209
- Uh...
- Whoo!

26:45.376 --> 26:47.667
- Eat lead, Sheriff!
- (coughing) Sheriff?

26:47.834 --> 26:51.042
- Yah! Yah! I'll get you boys!

26:51.209 --> 26:54.292
- Sheriff! Sheriff! Wait, Sheriff, wait!
- Yah! Giddy-up! Yah!

26:54.459 --> 26:57.584
- Not on my watch! Hi-yah!
- Sheriff! Sheriff! Sheriff?

26:57.751 --> 26:59.751
- C'mon! Yah! Yah!
- Sheriff? (sighing)

26:59.917 --> 27:01.542
- Sheriff...
- Yeah!

27:01.709 --> 27:05.542
- And stay out!
- (screaming) Oof!

27:05.709 --> 27:07.626
- Him again?
- Ow.

27:07.792 --> 27:09.376
That hurts. (gasping)

27:09.542 --> 27:11.376
Ugh! Ah...

27:11.542 --> 27:13.834
Come on! We had a deal!

27:14.001 --> 27:18.001
- Deal's off!
Your hay dun changed my steeds!

27:18.167 --> 27:20.167
Take a good look.

27:21.209 --> 27:23.792
- What are you talking about?
I don't see any...

27:23.959 --> 27:25.501
(whinnying)

27:27.334 --> 27:29.001
(whinnying)

27:29.167 --> 27:30.459
Ah...that's not good.

27:30.626 --> 27:32.876
(whinnying)

27:33.042 --> 27:36.501
- All they want to do is frolic
and dance around!

27:36.667 --> 27:38.876
And there's glitter everywhere!

27:39.042 --> 27:41.751
- The-the-the wizard
who sold me the hay

27:41.917 --> 27:43.709
didn't say anything
about sprouting wings!

27:43.876 --> 27:46.876
- Well, he should have!
Lying wizard!

27:47.042 --> 27:48.792
And I'm not paying you
a plumb cent!

27:48.959 --> 27:51.334
- No, no, no, no! Please!
I was counting on that money.

27:51.501 --> 27:54.001
I need to pay Glinara back!

27:54.167 --> 27:55.751
Aw, come on!

27:55.917 --> 28:00.292
- Oh, look who it is. You make friends
everywhere you go, don't you?

28:00.459 --> 28:04.251
- You! You're the maniac
who carjacked me, and lost all my hay!

28:04.417 --> 28:06.167
Why-why are you following me?!

28:06.334 --> 28:09.292
- Me? Following you?!
I don't think so.

28:09.459 --> 28:11.251
- 'Cause I already have
enough problems!

28:11.417 --> 28:13.167
- I'm just here to...

28:13.334 --> 28:15.501
...get a posse together.

28:16.542 --> 28:18.917
- You? Gather a posse?

28:19.084 --> 28:20.584
(snickering)

28:20.751 --> 28:22.917
(laughing)

28:24.709 --> 28:28.792
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
A posse. I gotta see this. Okay, go ahead.

28:28.959 --> 28:30.459
- Ugh!

28:30.626 --> 28:32.292
(vultures screeching)

28:36.167 --> 28:37.501
Ahem.

28:40.959 --> 28:43.376
Okay. Yee-haw!

28:43.542 --> 28:46.501
Um...giddy-up, lil' pardners.

28:46.667 --> 28:48.501
I'm, uh, leadin' a posse

28:48.667 --> 28:51.334
to find my rootin-est,
tootin-est brother.

28:53.167 --> 28:55.501
Don't it sound
like a hoot and a holler?

28:57.334 --> 28:59.042
(laughing)

28:59.209 --> 29:01.917
Uh-heh. I'll, uh...

29:02.959 --> 29:04.501
I'll pay a fair wage.

29:05.626 --> 29:07.376
(all): Oh!

29:07.542 --> 29:09.334
- Gold!

29:12.334 --> 29:15.126
- (clucking)
- (gasping)

29:17.084 --> 29:19.501
- Oh, great! You're all coming forward?

29:19.667 --> 29:21.709
This is excellent!
Do any of you have resumes?

29:21.876 --> 29:24.917
- Why didn't you tell me
you had Viking gold?!

29:25.084 --> 29:27.334
Are you out of your mind?
Put those away!

29:27.501 --> 29:29.376
Half this town
will kill you for them,

29:29.542 --> 29:31.709
the other half
doesn't need a reason!

29:31.876 --> 29:36.542
- How's about you hand over
that gold? Nice and slow-like.

29:36.709 --> 29:38.084
- Come on.
- Hi.

29:38.251 --> 29:39.751
- Guys?
- Walking away now.

29:39.917 --> 29:41.459
- We can work something out here.
- Ah!

29:41.626 --> 29:43.126
- Ooh!
- Ah!

29:44.542 --> 29:45.959
- Ah!
- (all shouting)

29:46.126 --> 29:48.001
(exclaiming)

29:48.167 --> 29:49.917
(screaming)

29:50.084 --> 29:51.834
(all): Whoo! Yee-hoo!

29:54.459 --> 29:56.792
- Ooh! What...?

29:56.959 --> 29:58.917
- Who are...? Excuse me!

29:59.084 --> 30:02.417
- Where'd she go?!
Oh, I see her! Get that gold!

30:03.459 --> 30:05.667
(exclaiming)

30:07.167 --> 30:09.084
- (cowboys shouting)
- Ah!

30:09.251 --> 30:10.459
- (whooping)
- I want that gold!

30:10.626 --> 30:12.542
(panting)

30:12.709 --> 30:14.084
- (whooping)
- Come on! Let's go!

30:14.251 --> 30:16.251
(musical honking)

30:17.667 --> 30:20.792
- Quick! Throw me the gold!
Throw me the gold! Hurry!

30:20.959 --> 30:22.959
- What?! No!
- Okay, get in!

30:23.126 --> 30:25.042
Get in! Come on! Come on!

30:25.209 --> 30:26.667
- We'll get you, girl!

30:28.334 --> 30:30.251
- Hey, wait! Wait, wait!
- (whinnying)

30:30.417 --> 30:32.709
- Oh!
- (disappointed exclamations)

30:43.751 --> 30:46.792
- Hey, uh, the saddlebag
move you did, nicely done.

30:46.959 --> 30:48.834
I was gonna do it, yeah...

30:49.001 --> 30:51.542
I was about to do it,
and then I saw you do it,

30:51.709 --> 30:53.876
and I was, like, well,
I'm not gonna do it now.

30:54.042 --> 30:55.417
But you know what?
No hard feelings.

30:55.584 --> 30:57.959
- Yeah, I could tell,
especially when you were

30:58.126 --> 30:59.876
hiding behind me
like a scared little poodle.

31:00.042 --> 31:02.001
- That's... (laughing)

31:02.167 --> 31:03.751
Uh, so...

31:05.126 --> 31:07.667
- About the gold?
- Seriously? (sighing)

31:07.834 --> 31:11.376
You know, you can just drop me
off at the next exit. I'm cool.

31:11.542 --> 31:15.959
- You want to get off
at Jurassic Jungle? Okay.

31:17.834 --> 31:19.917
(screeching)

31:20.084 --> 31:21.501
- Holy...!

31:21.667 --> 31:23.751
Um, you know,
on...on second thought,

31:23.917 --> 31:26.084
why don't we just keep driving, heh?

31:26.251 --> 31:27.792
I'm Marla, by the way.

31:27.959 --> 31:29.667
- Hi, Marla. I'm Del.

31:29.834 --> 31:32.917
And this is, uh,
Del's Belle, my truck.

31:33.084 --> 31:34.876
I don't let a lot of people in here,

31:35.042 --> 31:37.376
and I'm, uh, letting you in
because I like you,

31:37.542 --> 31:40.876
and not just because you're rich
or that you have a bag of coins.

31:41.042 --> 31:44.126
- That has nothing to do with it.
- Um, is this a food truck?

31:44.292 --> 31:48.001
- Used to be. Yeah, couple guys
in Summer Fun Land traded it to me

31:48.167 --> 31:50.584
for a pirate's cannon a few years ago.

31:50.751 --> 31:53.167
Now she's my mobile office,

31:53.334 --> 31:55.292
my apartment on wheels.

31:55.459 --> 31:57.376
I sleep here, I live here.

31:57.542 --> 32:00.001
Anyway, we have had some fun!
(laughing)

32:00.167 --> 32:02.834
Me and Del's Belle,
all the stories she could tell...

32:03.001 --> 32:04.626
- And I'd love to hear them.

32:04.792 --> 32:07.584
But I need to focus on finding
my little brother right now.

32:07.751 --> 32:09.584
- Okay. What does he look like?

32:09.751 --> 32:12.667
- Well, actually,
he's about this tall,

32:12.834 --> 32:15.001
tattoos, beard,

32:15.167 --> 32:17.417
carries around this giant axe.

32:17.584 --> 32:20.501
- How old is he?
- He's 10.

32:20.667 --> 32:23.501
- Well, lucky for you,
you ended up with me!

32:23.667 --> 32:27.084
With my connections,
I could find your brother, <i>no problemo.</i>

32:27.251 --> 32:30.417
But the truth is, my back's
against the wall here, alright?

32:30.584 --> 32:34.084
All I want to do is help. That's all
I want to do. But you know what?

32:34.251 --> 32:37.126
I'm gonna have to be
compensated for my time.

32:40.417 --> 32:43.084
How many gold coins
did you say were in the bag?

32:44.334 --> 32:45.959
- 40. Maybe 50.

32:46.126 --> 32:49.001
And they're all yours
if you can help me find Charlie.

32:49.167 --> 32:50.626
- You got yourself a deal.
- Deal!

32:50.792 --> 32:54.501
- Ha-ha-ha-ha! Yeah!
Me and Del's Belle are on the case!

32:54.667 --> 32:56.251
Ain't nothin' gonna stop...

32:56.417 --> 32:58.126
- Stop! Stop! Stop!
- (Marla screaming)

33:01.501 --> 33:03.501
- No...!
- (Del screaming)

33:03.667 --> 33:06.542
- (exclamations and screaming)
- (squirrel screeching)

33:10.917 --> 33:13.792
- Hold on! I'm gonna try
to bring her in for a landing!

33:13.959 --> 33:15.959
(both screaming)

33:17.876 --> 33:20.417
- Whoa...!

33:20.584 --> 33:22.167
- Whoo! Lean into it!

33:22.334 --> 33:24.126
(Marla screaming)

33:36.542 --> 33:38.584
- Oh.
- (pirate laughing)

33:38.751 --> 33:42.084
- We be rich, lads!
Tonight we feast!

33:42.251 --> 33:45.376
The first round of turkey legs
is on me, alright?!

33:45.542 --> 33:47.709
- What?!
I can't believe what I'm seeing!

33:47.876 --> 33:51.292
Me own crew
collectin' a booty for me booty?!

33:51.459 --> 33:53.834
- You think
you can just snatch me away

33:54.001 --> 33:57.084
from my Amazonian sisters
in the middle of the night?!

33:57.251 --> 34:00.459
Oh! Unleash me now
and see how you fare!

34:00.626 --> 34:04.501
- Pipe down, Amazonian.
You're hurting my ears.

34:04.667 --> 34:06.376
- Quiet, Zarkonian scum,

34:06.542 --> 34:08.833
or I'll rip your three tongues out
with my bare hands!

34:09.001 --> 34:12.917
- Argh! Ook-Ook free!
Ook-Ook free now!

34:13.083 --> 34:14.792
- (fanfare)
- All hail...

34:14.958 --> 34:16.917
...His Royal Highness!

34:17.083 --> 34:20.417
Emperor...Maximus!

34:22.876 --> 34:25.417
- Dum-da-da-dum...
(laughing)

34:25.583 --> 34:30.001
Well, well,
look what we have here.

34:30.167 --> 34:33.251
(laughing) I really was
on the nice list this year.

34:33.417 --> 34:35.917
- Argh!
- Mm. Yes, strong.

34:36.083 --> 34:39.458
And you have the braids
of a much stronger woman.

34:39.626 --> 34:41.458
- (laughing)
- This is a beard! Argh!

34:41.626 --> 34:44.542
- Oh! Oh!
- And what do we have here?

34:44.708 --> 34:46.751
- Your worst nightmare.

34:46.917 --> 34:49.001
- Pfft. You're not a piñata
full of bees?

34:49.167 --> 34:51.167
- Hey, sir! Let me go!
- Hmm?

34:51.333 --> 34:54.167
- My new Viking friends
are coming for me, I'm sure of it.

34:54.333 --> 34:57.459
And when they free me,
we're all gonna make you pay!

34:57.626 --> 34:59.626
- Ha! Well, good luck to them
finding you.

34:59.792 --> 35:01.584
Good luck to anyone
finding you here.

35:01.751 --> 35:05.501
(laughing)
This entire city is on a remote island.

35:05.667 --> 35:09.417
It's surrounded by jagged rocks
and an impenetrable wall,

35:09.584 --> 35:11.834
guarded day and night.

35:12.001 --> 35:13.834
No one's coming for you, kid.

35:14.001 --> 35:15.417
Trust me.

35:15.584 --> 35:17.126
- Balderdash!

35:17.292 --> 35:19.126
Release me now,

35:19.292 --> 35:23.292
and I may just let you live,
vile knave!

35:23.459 --> 35:26.167
- You kiss your mother
with that mouth? Pfft! Goodbye!

35:26.334 --> 35:29.376
- I'll get you! Ah! (grunting)
- (Emperor laughing)

35:29.542 --> 35:32.626

you'll find the headquarters for
a top-secret organization known as SKULL.

The Secret Killers Union
of Lethal Lemurs.

41:05.001 --> 41:07.542

48:38.501 --> 48:41.167
- Look, sorry if I seem on edge,
it's just...

48:41.334 --> 48:42.792
- Mm-hmm.

48:42.959 --> 48:46.917
- Charlie's out there,
somewhere, all alone.

48:48.084 --> 48:50.417
I'm supposed to be there for him and...

48:50.584 --> 48:52.292
...I haven't been.

48:56.459 --> 48:58.584
- "Hello."
What's that, Mr. Meatball?

48:58.751 --> 49:00.167
"I wanna meet Marla."

49:00.334 --> 49:02.834
Oh, the meatball
wants to meet Marla.

49:03.001 --> 49:04.542
Come on, come on.

49:04.709 --> 49:06.626
(high-pitched gibberish)

49:10.709 --> 49:12.167
- Whoa!

49:12.334 --> 49:14.251
These are really good.

49:14.417 --> 49:16.167
- Eh. Made 'em from scratch.
- Mm!

49:16.334 --> 49:18.084
You're really talented, Del.

49:18.251 --> 49:20.334
- Ever think about cooking for a living?
- (laughing)

49:20.501 --> 49:22.876
I'm not that good. I mean, I'm good.

49:23.042 --> 49:25.001
I've been told I could model, too.

49:25.167 --> 49:27.584
But, you know, I just cook...

49:27.751 --> 49:31.626
...what tastes great to me,
which is pretty much everything,

49:31.792 --> 49:33.501
which probably interfered
with my modeling.

49:33.667 --> 49:36.292
Oh! Alright, here we are.

49:36.459 --> 49:38.584
We're refueled, I'm refueled.
We should go.

49:38.751 --> 49:40.959
- But we don't know where to go!

49:41.126 --> 49:42.792
There's gotta be something
in this footage.

49:42.959 --> 49:44.834
- Wait! Stop! Let me see that.
- Huh?

49:45.001 --> 49:48.542
- What is it?
- Hold on. Uh, back, back. Zoom in.

49:49.626 --> 49:50.917
There!

49:51.084 --> 49:52.792
- Is that what made them disappear?
- I don't know.

49:52.959 --> 49:55.209
- But I sure recognize this!
- What is that?

49:55.376 --> 49:57.917
- Not a what. It's a who!

49:58.084 --> 50:01.126
And I know exactly
where we need to go now!

50:01.292 --> 50:04.959
Ah...come on!
Let's mo-ti-vate!

50:05.126 --> 50:07.042
- Wait. Del?
- What?

50:07.209 --> 50:10.834
- Uh, just...
thanks for everything so far.

50:11.001 --> 50:13.251
- Hey, I should be thanking you.

50:13.417 --> 50:16.376
After all, your bag of Viking coins

50:16.542 --> 50:17.917
is really gonna save my bacon.

50:18.084 --> 50:19.459
(chuckling) Big time!

50:19.626 --> 50:21.084
Whoo-hoo!

50:21.251 --> 50:23.709
We're coming for ya, lil' bro!

50:23.876 --> 50:25.334
(sighing)

50:25.501 --> 50:27.459
- I hope you're doing better
than I am, Marla.

50:27.626 --> 50:29.709
- (grunting and groaning)
- Uh...

50:29.876 --> 50:32.042
Oh...whoa!

50:32.209 --> 50:33.917
- (sighing)
- Ook-Ook.

50:34.084 --> 50:36.209
- Uh...
- Ook-Ook.

50:36.376 --> 50:38.834
- Uh! Uh...
- Repulsive!

50:39.001 --> 50:42.709
I will not spend another nanosecond
with this lower life form.

50:42.876 --> 50:46.126
- Arrogant talk coming
from a gutless bounty hunter!

50:46.292 --> 50:49.167
- (roaring)
- (rumbling)

50:50.626 --> 50:52.001
- Eh...

50:52.167 --> 50:54.251
Stow ye tempers.

50:55.876 --> 50:58.709
There be a common enemy
facing all of us,

50:58.876 --> 51:00.917
that horrible beastie!

51:01.084 --> 51:02.792
Look around, will ya?

51:02.959 --> 51:05.334
There's a reason
we were all captured.

51:05.501 --> 51:08.917
We're the toughest of the tough,
the baddest of the lot.

51:09.084 --> 51:10.709
Aye.

51:10.876 --> 51:14.209
And there be strength
in numbers.

51:14.376 --> 51:18.167
- Oh, I hate to say it,
but the pirate's right.

51:18.334 --> 51:19.834
We can survive together.

51:20.001 --> 51:23.292
After all, who among us
hasn't spit in death's face

51:23.459 --> 51:27.917
100 times in just the last month
and lived to tell about it?!

51:28.084 --> 51:30.292
(laughter)

51:30.459 --> 51:32.959
- Oh...yeah!
- (laughing)

51:33.126 --> 51:35.542
- Uh...
- Wookoo! Wookookoo!

51:35.709 --> 51:37.709
- Yeah!
- (rumbling)

51:37.876 --> 51:39.834
(roaring)

51:43.876 --> 51:46.459
- Aye, no time to waste.

51:46.626 --> 51:49.709
There be some escaping to do.

51:49.876 --> 51:51.584
(laughter)

51:54.209 --> 51:56.917
(Del): Ah, yes,
city of the future.

51:57.084 --> 51:58.709
Take it all in, Marla!

51:58.876 --> 52:00.459
- This is amazing!
- Ha-ha!

52:00.626 --> 52:03.334
Pretty wonderful, right?
Am I right? I'm right.

52:03.501 --> 52:05.792
Alright, let's do this!

52:05.959 --> 52:08.542
- Whoa.
- Hey, good to see you!

52:08.709 --> 52:10.334
Wow, your head looks thinner.

52:10.501 --> 52:12.917
Hey, keep it close.
This shouldn't take long.

52:13.084 --> 52:16.667
- Whoa! This is so cool.
- Marla, Marla.

52:16.834 --> 52:18.584
- Hey, uh, they don't like that.
- Pfft!

52:18.751 --> 52:20.167
- Let's go.
- Pfft!

52:20.334 --> 52:22.042
- It's like one of those stress balls.

52:22.209 --> 52:24.126
Someone gave me one once.
It didn't help.

52:24.292 --> 52:25.834
Oh!

52:27.376 --> 52:28.959
- (club music playing)
- A club?

52:29.126 --> 52:31.334
- Hey, careful, you might
be having a good time.

52:31.501 --> 52:34.334
Hey! Hi! Ha-ha!
What's going on?

52:34.501 --> 52:36.501
- I'm not really in the mood
to dance right now.

52:36.667 --> 52:38.501
- We're here to see Glinara!

52:38.667 --> 52:39.959
- What?! Glinara?!

52:40.126 --> 52:43.042
- This is her club,
but...but it's all a front.

52:43.209 --> 52:46.459
She's got her hands
in everything illegal,

52:46.626 --> 52:49.251
including black-market tech.

52:49.417 --> 52:51.959
- Come on.
- O-okay.

52:52.126 --> 52:54.459
I just didn't realize
we were seeing her so soon.

52:54.626 --> 52:56.709
- Relax, Marla.

52:56.876 --> 52:59.917
Ha-ha! What's up?

53:00.084 --> 53:03.126
Tell the boss
Del's here to see her.

53:03.292 --> 53:05.042
I have her money.

53:06.084 --> 53:07.292
- Uh...

53:07.459 --> 53:09.542
- I got a Del down here
askin' to see Miss G.

53:09.709 --> 53:12.084
- No, not Adele. That'd be awesome.
- But what if...

53:12.251 --> 53:14.626
- No, just Del. Yeah, yeah.
- What if we don't have enough?

53:14.792 --> 53:16.417
- What are you talking about? Trust me.

53:16.584 --> 53:19.917
You have enough gold
in that bag to pay off my debt

53:20.084 --> 53:23.001
and buy the info we need about Charlie.

53:23.167 --> 53:26.376
Because if you didn't,
we wouldn't get outta here alive.

53:26.542 --> 53:28.001
- Huh.
- Del!

53:28.167 --> 53:30.042
She's ready. Let's go.

53:30.209 --> 53:32.917
- You see?
- Uh...Del?

53:33.084 --> 53:35.792
I really think we should talk
about this first.

53:35.959 --> 53:38.042
- Will you stop worrying?
We're perfectly safe.

53:38.209 --> 53:41.292
Deep down, Glinara
is a completely delightful...

53:41.459 --> 53:42.876
- Whoa!
- (exclamation)

53:43.042 --> 53:44.917
- Oh, my... Oh.
- (robot groaning)

53:45.084 --> 53:46.792
- I want umbrellas in my drinks!

53:46.959 --> 53:48.917
- Hey, are you alright?
- Ow!

53:49.084 --> 53:51.959
- Here, let me help you up.
(grunting)

53:52.126 --> 53:54.584
Oh, poor little robot.

53:54.751 --> 53:56.209
Hey, it's okay.

53:56.376 --> 53:59.292
We're not gonna hurt you.
We're not scary. I promise.

53:59.459 --> 54:01.876
- Dude! You took quite a spill.
You okay?

54:02.042 --> 54:03.792
(indistinct robot chatter)

54:03.959 --> 54:06.001
- Del! Get up here already!

54:06.167 --> 54:08.126
- Gotta go, gotta go!

54:08.292 --> 54:10.126
- Delightful, huh?

54:10.292 --> 54:14.584
- There she is, my Glinara!
Look at you!

54:14.751 --> 54:16.501
Give me a couple coins.
I'm gonna need 'em.

54:16.667 --> 54:17.959
- Oh, um...here.

54:18.126 --> 54:20.042
- You look amazing!

54:20.209 --> 54:23.542
I mean, just as radiant as ever.
Mwah, mwah!

54:23.709 --> 54:25.626
- Ah, can the sweet talk, Del.

54:25.792 --> 54:29.001
You know I always glow
during molting season. Hmm...

54:29.167 --> 54:30.751
- Um... Oh!
- Who are you?

54:30.917 --> 54:32.584
- A little tight. Um...

54:32.751 --> 54:35.292
- I'm...I'm Marla. Oh!
- Oh, you thought I cared?

54:35.459 --> 54:37.417
- Ha! You're hilarious!
- Ow!

54:37.584 --> 54:40.292
- Now, where's my money, Del?
- Huh!

54:40.459 --> 54:43.667
- Please don't make me do
something I don't want to do.

54:43.834 --> 54:48.042
- Relax! You're gonna get back
double what I owe you.

54:48.209 --> 54:50.584
- Oh! So shiny!

54:51.751 --> 54:54.209
Oh, my little Viking gold.
Who loves you more than I do?

54:54.376 --> 54:55.584
- Double? Okay.
- Nobody.

54:55.751 --> 54:59.334
- Uh, Del?
- Glinny, I just need some help.

54:59.501 --> 55:03.209
I saw your logo on some high-tech,
disappearing-gizmo thing.

55:03.376 --> 55:05.876
- A disappearing... Ah!

55:06.042 --> 55:10.042
(chuckling) Why would I tell you
about illegal cloaking devices?

55:10.209 --> 55:12.751
If I knew, which of course I don't.

55:12.917 --> 55:16.334
- Oh...what's that behind your ear?

55:16.501 --> 55:18.584
(gasping, then squealing)

55:18.751 --> 55:20.626
(laughing)

55:20.792 --> 55:23.209
- Del! You, rascal, you!

55:23.376 --> 55:25.542
Robotitron, get over here!

55:25.709 --> 55:27.334
(indistinct robot chatter)

55:27.501 --> 55:30.917
- Show me the black-market files.
- (indistinct robot chatter)

55:31.084 --> 55:33.292
- Uh-huh-huh.
Hmm-hmm-hmm.

55:33.459 --> 55:37.792
Oh, yes, looks like I did sell
cloaking devices. Who knew? Ah...

55:37.959 --> 55:40.126
Oh, Maximus...

55:40.292 --> 55:43.959
- Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.
You mean Emperor Maximus?

55:44.126 --> 55:46.042
- Who's that?
- Oh, Emperor Maximus

55:46.209 --> 55:50.417
is the supreme ruler of Constantinopolis
and my number-one client.

55:50.584 --> 55:54.001
- Well, your client has my brother,
and we're going to get him back!

55:54.167 --> 55:56.792
- Oh, cupcake,
if Maximus has your brother,

55:56.959 --> 56:00.417
that means he's fighting
in the coliseum tomorrow night!

56:00.584 --> 56:03.917
- Fighting? Tomorrow?!
Del, we need to go now!

56:04.084 --> 56:07.084
- Forget something?
The rest of my money?!

56:07.251 --> 56:09.542
- Okay, okay. Easy, easy.
(chuckling)

56:09.709 --> 56:11.334
I'm a man of my word.

56:11.501 --> 56:14.709
Marla, the rest
of the gold coins if you will.

56:14.876 --> 56:17.334
- Um, yeah, about that...

56:17.501 --> 56:19.126
We should've
really discussed this.

56:19.292 --> 56:22.459
- Marla? Stop messing around. Let go.

56:22.626 --> 56:24.542
- You let go!
- Would you...

56:24.709 --> 56:27.209
- You don't want to do this!
- Oh, yes, I do. I really do!

56:27.376 --> 56:29.209
- No, you...don't!

56:30.626 --> 56:33.917
- What the heck is...
What the heck is this?!

56:34.084 --> 56:37.042
Is this a spoon?!
Where's...where's the money?

56:37.209 --> 56:40.792
- Del, I'm so sorry,
but...I never had the money.

56:40.959 --> 56:44.501
- Marla, you...you lied to me?

56:44.667 --> 56:47.709
- I had to do everything I could
to save my brother. Even lie!

56:47.876 --> 56:51.251
I was gonna tell you. I'm...I'm sorry!

56:51.417 --> 56:55.459
- Whap, whap, whap!
Guess you got taken for a ride, Del. Hmm?

56:55.626 --> 56:57.959
And since you don't have my money,

56:58.126 --> 57:00.834
it looks like this is your last stop!

57:01.001 --> 57:02.709
- Uh, Glinara? Please!
(laughing)

57:02.876 --> 57:04.501
Hey, c'mon.
We can work something out.

57:04.667 --> 57:08.667
- He has nothing to do with this!
He was just helping me! Please! Oh!

57:08.834 --> 57:10.834
- If I were you, and I'm glad I'm not,

57:11.001 --> 57:12.542
I'd worry less about your brother

57:12.709 --> 57:15.292
and more about what I'm gonna
do to the two you.

57:23.834 --> 57:26.459
- (Charlie): Whoa!
- Toss me the janglers.

57:29.209 --> 57:31.959
Ugh. The keys. Toss me the keys.

57:34.251 --> 57:36.167
Thank ye.
(snickering)

57:38.501 --> 57:41.501
- Uh...are they gonna be okay?
- Don't worry.

57:41.667 --> 57:45.626
They'll wake up in...
12 to 48 hours.

57:45.792 --> 57:47.084
- C'mon! C'mon! Hurry now!

57:47.251 --> 57:49.501
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Shhh! Keep it down!

57:55.959 --> 57:57.417
Now's our chance!

57:57.584 --> 57:58.792
- Ook-Ook, you're up.
- Ook!

57:58.959 --> 58:00.709
- Show us where the fishies swim!

58:00.876 --> 58:04.167
- Ook, Ook, Ook.
- Well, now that's cute. But no.

58:04.334 --> 58:07.709
Not <i>how</i> do fishies swim,
<i>where</i> do fishies swim!

58:07.876 --> 58:09.459
- Ook-Ook.
(sniffing)

58:09.626 --> 58:12.334
- On with ye now!
- Fishies! Me want fishies!

58:12.501 --> 58:14.042
- (laughing)
- Look at him go!

58:14.209 --> 58:15.959
- Follow that hairy beast!

58:16.126 --> 58:17.667
(creature howling)

58:21.084 --> 58:24.376
- Fishies!
- Oh, good job, Ook-Ook.

58:24.542 --> 58:25.917
- Me want fishies!

58:26.084 --> 58:27.709
- Okay!
- Whoa!

58:27.876 --> 58:29.459
- Which boat do we take?
- Ha!

58:29.626 --> 58:33.459
Nah, we be escapin' in style.

58:33.626 --> 58:36.584
- Wow! A real-life pirate ship!

58:36.751 --> 58:38.376
- Not just any pirate ship.

58:38.542 --> 58:41.792
Me own girl, the Thunderous Eel!

Just think it through.

59:49.334 --> 59:50.917
- Ook!

59:51.084 --> 59:52.834
- It's now or never, Captain!

59:53.001 --> 59:56.209
- Um...okay!
Let's pull on, uh...

59:56.376 --> 01:00:00.376
...that rope, that one and...that one!

01:00:03.584 --> 01:00:05.792

01:00:07.876 --> 01:00:09.959

- We're moving!
- We did it!

01:00:18.834 --> 01:00:21.542
- Ook-Ook!
- Yes! It worked! (laughing)

01:00:21.709 --> 01:00:23.709
- They're getting away!
Stop them!

01:00:23.876 --> 01:00:25.334
Halt! Stop!

Yeah-ha-ha!

01:00:31.709 --> 01:00:34.042
- Yeah!
- Good instinct, Viking!

01:00:34.209 --> 01:00:38.167
- (laughing) If Marla
could only see me now.

01:00:45.501 --> 01:00:46.751
(laughing) Almost.

01:00:46.917 --> 01:00:49.042
- (guards laughing)
- (groaning)

01:00:50.334 --> 01:00:52.042
- What'd I miss?

01:00:52.209 --> 01:00:54.584
- Del, I know
what I did was wrong.

01:00:54.751 --> 01:00:56.834
- How many times can I say I'm sorry?
- (Del humming)

01:00:57.001 --> 01:00:59.792
- But we need to work together
if we're gonna get out of this.

01:00:59.959 --> 01:01:01.417
- Is someone talking to me?

01:01:01.584 --> 01:01:03.917
I don't know, because I've blocked out
all liars and traitors,

01:01:04.084 --> 01:01:06.334
so I can't hear anything
from people that are jerks.

01:01:06.501 --> 01:01:07.751
- Pipe down, you two!

01:01:07.917 --> 01:01:10.126
Now, where is the top destination

01:01:10.292 --> 01:01:12.334
for double-crossers this season?

01:01:12.501 --> 01:01:14.542
- Glinara! Slug Muffin!
- Hmm. Ooh.

01:01:14.709 --> 01:01:17.042
The scorching desert
of Pharaoh Dunes?

01:01:17.209 --> 01:01:18.709
Ooh, you are gonna burn!

01:01:18.876 --> 01:01:20.917
- (Del laughing) Come on!
- No, no, no! Not there, not there!

01:01:21.084 --> 01:01:24.084
- Or maybe the unforgiving,
frigid terrain of Yeti Tundra!

01:01:24.251 --> 01:01:25.709
- Oh, come on!
- No!

01:01:25.876 --> 01:01:29.501
- Better yet... Oh!
The volcanoes of Pompeii Plaza!

01:01:29.667 --> 01:01:31.917
Yes! (maniacal laughter)

01:01:32.084 --> 01:01:33.876
- No, no! Come on, Glinara, please!

01:01:34.042 --> 01:01:37.501
If you have even one decent bone
in your body, you can't do this!

01:01:37.667 --> 01:01:40.459
- I don't have bones in my body,
thank you very much. (laughing)

01:01:40.626 --> 01:01:42.167
- No, no, no!
- Please! Glinara!

01:01:42.334 --> 01:01:44.917
- Buh-bye! (laughing)

01:01:45.084 --> 01:01:47.334
- Oh, I love this part!
- Del! Ah!

01:01:47.501 --> 01:01:48.917
(screaming)

01:01:49.084 --> 01:01:51.834
- (grunting)
- Huh?!

01:01:52.001 --> 01:01:53.542
- Oh!

01:01:53.709 --> 01:01:56.792
- You saved us, little guy! Thank you!
- Oh, thank you, buddy!

01:01:56.959 --> 01:01:58.876
- Robotitron! How dare you?!

01:01:59.042 --> 01:02:01.376
- Ha-ha-ha! Ow. Oh, my.

01:02:01.542 --> 01:02:03.459
- (Marla): Whoa! Ah! Whoa!
- Oh, no, no.

01:02:03.626 --> 01:02:05.709
(screaming)

01:02:05.876 --> 01:02:07.501
- Go! Hurry up! Get 'em!

01:02:07.667 --> 01:02:10.042
- Come on! Let's go, boys!
- (screaming)

01:02:10.209 --> 01:02:11.876
- Whoa...! Hold on!

01:02:12.042 --> 01:02:13.751
- Changing channel,
changing channel, changing.

01:02:13.917 --> 01:02:15.251
- Changing.
- (Del shouting)

01:02:15.417 --> 01:02:16.917
(Del): Ah! Sharks!

01:02:17.084 --> 01:02:19.626
- No, flowers!
- Flowers!

01:02:19.792 --> 01:02:21.542
- (maniacal laughter)
- Go back to the flowers!

01:02:21.709 --> 01:02:25.376
Oh! Don't let go!

01:02:26.501 --> 01:02:28.042
(maniacal laughter)

01:02:28.209 --> 01:02:30.459
(crow cawing)

01:02:30.626 --> 01:02:33.667
(screaming)

01:02:33.834 --> 01:02:36.042
(exclaiming and grunting)

01:02:36.209 --> 01:02:37.792
- Ow!
- (screaming)

01:02:37.959 --> 01:02:39.667
(indistinct robot chatter)

01:02:39.834 --> 01:02:41.542
(exclaiming)

01:02:41.709 --> 01:02:44.626
- Oh...yes! Yes! We made it!

01:02:44.792 --> 01:02:46.709
We're alive! We're alive!

01:02:46.876 --> 01:02:49.501
Oh! And now we know
where Charlie is!

01:02:49.667 --> 01:02:51.792
We still have a full day
to get to him.

01:02:51.959 --> 01:02:54.209
We can do this! Oh!

01:02:54.376 --> 01:02:56.876
Is that a fairytale castle?!

01:02:57.042 --> 01:02:59.417
Yes! If we can find help
at the castle, then we can...

01:02:59.584 --> 01:03:05.001
- We?! I'm sorry,
I...I keep hearing "we." There is no we!

01:03:05.167 --> 01:03:09.542
Not anymore, Marla!
This little adventure of ours is over!

01:03:09.709 --> 01:03:12.084
(indistinct robot chatter)

01:03:12.251 --> 01:03:14.709
- You lied to me!
- Ugh! Del, come on!

01:03:14.876 --> 01:03:17.126
Would you have helped me
for no money?!

01:03:17.292 --> 01:03:19.709
- Would I have helped you?
How dare you?

01:03:19.876 --> 01:03:21.292
- (both grunting)
- Probably not.

01:03:21.459 --> 01:03:23.042
I probably wouldn't have helped you.

01:03:23.209 --> 01:03:25.501
But...that's not the point.
(grunting)

01:03:29.292 --> 01:03:30.876
That is the point.

01:03:31.042 --> 01:03:34.792
I mean, is there anyone's life
you don't ruin, Marla?

01:03:34.959 --> 01:03:37.251
- (sighing)
- (crow cawing)

01:03:37.417 --> 01:03:40.334
- Good luck finding your brother!
I really do mean that.

01:03:40.501 --> 01:03:44.459
- Del! Del, wait!
- But I also hope you don't find me.

01:03:44.626 --> 01:03:47.501
- I can't do this without you. Del!

01:03:47.667 --> 01:03:49.792
- (robot): Del.
- Well, fine!

01:03:49.959 --> 01:03:53.501
If that's the way you want it,
Robotitron's gonna help me...

01:03:55.417 --> 01:03:57.334
...find Charlie.

01:03:57.501 --> 01:03:59.834
- (people moaning)
- Well, look who it is!

01:04:00.001 --> 01:04:03.292
My little rotten runaways.
(laughing) How's that taste?

01:04:03.459 --> 01:04:05.001
Oh, oh, oh!

01:04:05.167 --> 01:04:08.834
I see you're taking <i>stock</i>
of your new accommodations.

01:04:09.001 --> 01:04:11.542
See what I did with the words?
Alright, let's go.

01:04:11.709 --> 01:04:13.209
Where are the rose pedals?!

01:04:13.376 --> 01:04:16.167
- This is all my fault.
- Ya think?!

01:04:16.334 --> 01:04:18.167
- I just wanted an adventure,

01:04:18.334 --> 01:04:20.959
to have some fun
with my sister for once.

01:04:21.126 --> 01:04:24.667
Marla. I don't even know
where she is.

01:04:24.834 --> 01:04:26.542
I hope she's not in trouble too.

01:04:26.709 --> 01:04:29.751
- Or eaten by a shark.
- What?! Don't say that!

01:04:29.917 --> 01:04:31.626
- I'm sorry.
- (Charlie sighing)

01:04:31.792 --> 01:04:35.084
- My sister and I got
into a huge fight.

01:04:35.251 --> 01:04:38.084
I bet...she hates me now.

01:04:40.584 --> 01:04:42.667
- I, too, miss my sisters
back in Amazonia.

01:04:42.834 --> 01:04:46.042
The fights we had
amongst ourselves were legend!

01:04:46.209 --> 01:04:49.542
But we loved each other
fiercely as well.

01:04:50.834 --> 01:04:53.834
- Out of the way! Move along!
Fresh meat coming through!

01:04:54.001 --> 01:04:55.751
- (crowd booing)
- (grunting)

01:04:55.917 --> 01:04:57.501
- Alright, alright, I'm coming!

01:04:57.667 --> 01:04:59.167
Ugh. Ugh.

01:04:59.334 --> 01:05:01.084
(grunting)

01:05:01.251 --> 01:05:02.792
How's my hair?

01:05:02.959 --> 01:05:05.959
(gasping)
You're the missing warriors.

01:05:06.126 --> 01:05:08.084
Secret Agent Rex Dasher.

01:05:08.251 --> 01:05:09.834
- ♪ Rex Dash... ♪
- Oh!

01:05:10.001 --> 01:05:11.334

01:05:11.501 --> 01:05:12.959
- At your service.

01:05:13.126 --> 01:05:14.834
I was on a mission
to rescue you all.

01:05:15.001 --> 01:05:19.917
And this brute must be - ha! -
Charlie the Viking!

01:05:20.084 --> 01:05:23.376
Ah, your sister Marla
is coming for you, my good man.

01:05:23.542 --> 01:05:25.542
- You know Marla?
- Know her?

01:05:25.709 --> 01:05:27.667
I served side-by-side with her.

01:05:27.834 --> 01:05:30.667
She's battled all manner of deadly foe

01:05:30.834 --> 01:05:32.751
and unspeakable danger to find you.

01:05:32.917 --> 01:05:34.626
- Wow.
- (laughing)

01:05:34.792 --> 01:05:36.834
- Sounds like a true Amazonian!

01:05:37.001 --> 01:05:38.417
- She'd make a great bounty hunter.

01:05:38.584 --> 01:05:41.167
- Ha-ha!
Tell us about this amazing lass!

01:05:41.334 --> 01:05:42.709
- Ook-Ook!
- (groaning)

01:05:42.876 --> 01:05:44.709
- Charlie?
What are you doin', lad?

01:05:44.876 --> 01:05:48.584
- Argh! I need...to find my...

01:05:48.751 --> 01:05:50.417
- ...sister!

01:05:50.584 --> 01:05:52.751
- Stop!
- (exclamations)

01:05:52.917 --> 01:05:54.751
- Emergency! Emperor!

01:05:54.917 --> 01:05:57.459
- Ah, are you kidding me?
Now what?

01:05:57.626 --> 01:05:59.751
(gasping) Oh, my! Where...

01:05:59.917 --> 01:06:03.167
Where did they go?
What am I paying you for?! Get them!

01:06:03.334 --> 01:06:05.042
- (Charlie): Let's go!
- (exclamations)

01:06:05.209 --> 01:06:06.584
- They're on our tail!

01:06:06.751 --> 01:06:09.084
(all): Shuffle, shuffle,
shuffle, shuffle, shuffle!

01:06:10.959 --> 01:06:12.751
- Oh! Oh! Oh!
- Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle!

01:06:12.917 --> 01:06:14.334

01:06:14.501 --> 01:06:16.209
- And heave!
- Look out!

01:06:16.376 --> 01:06:18.167
- Okay, we need to turn!
- Hard left!

01:06:18.334 --> 01:06:19.834
(exclamations)

01:06:20.001 --> 01:06:21.542

We're not gonna make it!

01:06:31.501 --> 01:06:33.751
- Come on, guys,
we're not done yet!

01:06:33.917 --> 01:06:35.417

01:06:37.292 --> 01:06:39.626
- Charles, what are you doing?

- You're a great warrior Viking.
- You're alright, kid.

01:06:50.376 --> 01:06:51.792
- Go! Go!

- Hey, droopy, up.
Up on the corner. Ah...

01:07:02.334 --> 01:07:05.417
You think you're so brave,

01:07:05.584 --> 01:07:07.542
letting your co-stars escape?

01:07:07.709 --> 01:07:10.876
Well, Mr. Big Shot, in one hour,

01:07:11.042 --> 01:07:15.376
it'll be a one-man show where you're
fighting for your life in my arena!

01:07:15.542 --> 01:07:18.792
All...by...your...lonesome!

01:07:21.584 --> 01:07:24.792
(moaning and groaning)

01:07:24.959 --> 01:07:26.834
(grunting)

01:07:28.334 --> 01:07:31.334
- You okay, buddy?
You're sounding a little squeaky.

01:07:31.501 --> 01:07:33.001
- No. Okay.

01:07:33.167 --> 01:07:35.084
- We're going to find help.

01:07:35.251 --> 01:07:38.459
I-I think the castle is...this way.

01:07:39.501 --> 01:07:41.667
- (wolf howling)
- Uh...

01:07:42.709 --> 01:07:43.959
This...way?

01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:45.751
- Okay. Okay.

01:07:45.917 --> 01:07:47.667
(grunting)

01:07:49.751 --> 01:07:51.667
- We gotta be close.

01:07:52.709 --> 01:07:54.542
(sighing) How long...

01:07:54.709 --> 01:07:56.126
...have we been walking?

01:07:56.292 --> 01:07:59.792
- (exclamations)
- Ah! Whoa! Oof!

01:07:59.959 --> 01:08:01.959
Oh! Ow!

01:08:02.126 --> 01:08:03.626
Argh...!

01:08:03.792 --> 01:08:06.792
Oh, I am so sorry.
Are...are you okay?

01:08:06.959 --> 01:08:09.042
- My arm.
- Let me get that for you.

01:08:09.209 --> 01:08:10.959
- I'm fine.
- Is that better?

01:08:11.126 --> 01:08:13.667
- Yes.
- That was my fault. I...

01:08:13.834 --> 01:08:16.251
(sighing)
Wait a second. No!

01:08:16.417 --> 01:08:18.251
No, this can't be right!

01:08:18.417 --> 01:08:20.209
We're right back
where we started!

01:08:21.584 --> 01:08:24.876
- This can't possibly get any worse!
- (thunder crashing)

01:08:26.001 --> 01:08:28.334
Oh, come on!

01:08:28.501 --> 01:08:31.167
(indistinct robot chatter)

01:08:41.292 --> 01:08:43.376
- (grunting)
- Ow!

01:08:43.542 --> 01:08:44.917
What the...?

01:08:45.084 --> 01:08:46.876
- What was that?
- Careful. Careful.

01:08:47.042 --> 01:08:49.376
- Ah...
- Who...who's there?

01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:51.459
(moaning)

01:08:55.751 --> 01:08:57.334
Whoa-ho-ho!

01:08:57.501 --> 01:08:59.209
- Ugh. Ow!

01:08:59.376 --> 01:09:00.584
- Wow!
- Who are you?

01:09:00.751 --> 01:09:02.959
- Really?
The gown-and-wand ensemble?

01:09:03.126 --> 01:09:06.167
The shimmering glow?
The floating in the air?

01:09:06.334 --> 01:09:08.334
None of that gave it away?

01:09:08.501 --> 01:09:10.917
Hello? I'm a fairy godmother.

01:09:11.084 --> 01:09:12.667
- Oh. Ooh.

01:09:12.834 --> 01:09:14.501
Sorry about that.
(chuckling)

01:09:14.667 --> 01:09:16.876
- No worries. Easy fix.

01:09:17.042 --> 01:09:19.959
Wait a minute.
You're the voice that I heard.

01:09:20.126 --> 01:09:22.209
- Yeah...that was me.
- Well...

01:09:22.376 --> 01:09:25.209
people are usually so excited
to see a fairy godmother,

01:09:25.376 --> 01:09:27.626
they generally
don't hurl things at my face.

01:09:27.792 --> 01:09:30.084
For instance, the bearded guy
I ran into a few hours ago...

01:09:30.251 --> 01:09:32.126
- Del?
- ...would not stop hugging me.

01:09:32.292 --> 01:09:33.959
- You saw Del? Is he okay?

01:09:34.126 --> 01:09:37.084
- No. Sadly, the wolves got him.

01:09:37.251 --> 01:09:39.667
- What?!
- (laughing) Kidding. Kidding.

01:09:39.834 --> 01:09:41.667
Jeez. Calm down. Come on.

01:09:41.834 --> 01:09:43.709
What kind of a fairy godmother
would I be?

01:09:43.876 --> 01:09:46.501
I gave him a wish
and I sent him on his way.

01:09:46.667 --> 01:09:48.959
- A wish?
- That's what I do.

01:09:49.126 --> 01:09:52.667
I find people who seem lost
and set them on the right path.

01:09:52.834 --> 01:09:54.459
I'm amazing.

01:09:54.626 --> 01:09:57.001
- Okay, great! I've got until
sundown to save my brother.

01:09:57.167 --> 01:10:00.126
Can you please use that wand
to zap him back to me?

01:10:00.292 --> 01:10:03.167
- Ha! No. My wishes
don't quite work like that.

01:10:03.334 --> 01:10:05.542
I mean, Cinderella got her gown,

01:10:05.709 --> 01:10:08.584
but she still had to go
to the ball herself.

01:10:08.751 --> 01:10:12.417
- I've tried doing it myself.
But look at me, I'm a wreck.

01:10:12.584 --> 01:10:14.667
- Girl, we gotta change that attitude.

01:10:14.834 --> 01:10:18.084
Now, come on, step into my office.

01:10:18.251 --> 01:10:21.334
It's a place
where wishes come true.

01:10:21.501 --> 01:10:23.167
(birdsong)

01:10:23.334 --> 01:10:25.292
- (neighing)
- (robot): Wow.

01:10:25.459 --> 01:10:27.751
- How did I not find this place?

01:10:27.917 --> 01:10:30.417
- Sometimes we don't see
what's right in front of us.

01:10:30.584 --> 01:10:34.209
- (robot): Wow, wow, wow.
- Also, it's magic.

01:10:34.376 --> 01:10:36.667
There's still time to save Charlie.

01:10:36.834 --> 01:10:40.209

for the beastie. (laughing)

01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:47.084
So it's...heavily guarded
and impossibly tall.

01:14:47.251 --> 01:14:48.959

I used to do. Let...let's go.

- Ah!

01:15:14.917 --> 01:15:16.417

- Hi-yah!

(background chatter)

01:15:26.834 --> 01:15:29.584
- ...was broken by a cartful
of watermelons!

01:15:29.751 --> 01:15:33.334
Let the other guards know
immediately. Go, go, go!

01:15:33.501 --> 01:15:35.376
- We need to blend in.

01:15:36.542 --> 01:15:38.251
Hmm...

01:15:42.126 --> 01:15:46.209
- Let's go. Ready. Ready!
- (laughing)

01:15:46.376 --> 01:15:49.959
- Love the disguise, buddy, but, uh,
you still stick out like a sore thumb.

01:15:50.126 --> 01:15:53.126
Stay put. I'll be back for you
once I get Charlie.

01:15:53.292 --> 01:15:54.584
- Danger, danger.

01:15:54.751 --> 01:15:57.167
- Don't worry, I'll be fine.

01:15:57.334 --> 01:15:59.417
- I'll see you soon.
- Bye-bye.

01:16:01.001 --> 01:16:03.542
- Not if I can help it.
- ...that fits this description?

01:16:03.709 --> 01:16:06.542
They are wearing a backpack
with a sword sticking out of...

01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:08.584
- Do you mean like that?

01:16:09.626 --> 01:16:11.167
- Hey! Hey, you!

01:16:11.334 --> 01:16:13.001
Stop at once!

01:16:18.001 --> 01:16:21.667
Guards! I spotted an intruder
inside our very city!

01:16:21.834 --> 01:16:23.792
Go now! Go!

01:16:26.501 --> 01:16:28.084

01:16:31.542 --> 01:16:33.459

01:16:34.501 --> 01:16:36.292
- Charlie?

01:16:36.459 --> 01:16:39.292
Oh...Charlie?!

01:16:39.459 --> 01:16:41.417
Oh!

01:16:42.459 --> 01:16:43.834
Charlie!

01:16:47.834 --> 01:16:50.001
- (fanfare)
- (crowd cheering)

01:16:57.126 --> 01:16:58.626
- Hey, chop-chop! Let's go!

01:16:58.792 --> 01:17:00.459
Bring me the stepstool!
Take it! Come on!

01:17:00.626 --> 01:17:02.042
- No way! You take it!
- You take it!

01:17:02.209 --> 01:17:03.917
- It's not my job!
- Take it right now.

01:17:04.084 --> 01:17:05.459
- I'm not taking it.
- I am letting go!

01:17:05.626 --> 01:17:07.001
- My hands are in the air!
- Do it!

01:17:07.167 --> 01:17:09.417
- No. No.
- Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes!

01:17:09.584 --> 01:17:11.459
(fanfare)

01:17:12.501 --> 01:17:14.709
(wild cheering)

01:17:21.292 --> 01:17:25.084
- (crowd chanting): Maximus!
- Oh! Charlie?

01:17:26.292 --> 01:17:27.501
Oh!

01:17:27.667 --> 01:17:29.042
(cheering)

01:17:31.792 --> 01:17:35.001
- Whoo!
- (all): Maximus! Maximus!

01:17:35.167 --> 01:17:37.292
- (all): Maximus!
- Maximus! We want Maximus!

01:17:37.459 --> 01:17:40.917
- Ha-ha! Aw, you're all cheering
for me and I love it!

01:17:41.084 --> 01:17:43.501
(laughing)
I love it, I love it, I love it!

01:17:43.667 --> 01:17:46.501
Make sure I'm outta here before
any of this riffraff can touch me.

01:17:46.667 --> 01:17:48.084
And now...

01:17:48.251 --> 01:17:51.876
...the moment
you've all been waiting for!

01:17:52.042 --> 01:17:54.334
I give you...

01:17:54.501 --> 01:17:57.459
...Charles the Destroyer!

01:17:59.542 --> 01:18:02.292
(crowd cheering)

01:18:04.001 --> 01:18:05.459
- Ah...

01:18:06.501 --> 01:18:08.417
(grunting)

01:18:08.584 --> 01:18:10.501
Huh...uh...

01:18:10.667 --> 01:18:16.126
- I, Emperor Maximus
of Constantinopolis,

01:18:16.292 --> 01:18:19.042
declare the games...

01:18:19.209 --> 01:18:21.126
- ...open!
- (whistling)

01:18:21.292 --> 01:18:22.751
- What?!

01:18:24.084 --> 01:18:26.834
Oh! Hey! Who do you think...
Oh! Oh-ho!

01:18:30.792 --> 01:18:33.584
- Uh...
- Oh! Ah! Hey!

01:18:33.751 --> 01:18:35.084
(all gasping)

01:18:35.251 --> 01:18:36.876
(crowd cheering)

01:18:37.042 --> 01:18:39.584
- Uh...
- (cheering)

01:18:39.751 --> 01:18:41.667
- Wait!
- Yah!

01:18:41.834 --> 01:18:44.792
- Huh?
- (triumphant music)

01:18:44.959 --> 01:18:46.417
- Marla?

01:18:46.584 --> 01:18:49.251
Marla! Oh!

01:18:49.417 --> 01:18:51.042
- (all): Ooh!
- Oh, Charlie!

01:18:51.209 --> 01:18:52.959
Thank goodness I found you!

01:18:53.126 --> 01:18:56.126
- You're the knight!
You're really the noble knight!

01:18:56.292 --> 01:18:58.292
- What a treat.

01:18:58.459 --> 01:19:02.126
We have a special guest
for tonight's show!

01:19:02.292 --> 01:19:03.709
(laughing) Don't worry.

01:19:03.876 --> 01:19:06.334
You can all pay extra for it
on the way out.

01:19:06.501 --> 01:19:08.417
Now, release the beast!

01:19:08.584 --> 01:19:10.917
(cheering)

01:19:14.167 --> 01:19:16.834
- (growling)
- (shuddering)

01:19:18.001 --> 01:19:20.251
- Here he comes, here he comes,
here he comes, here he comes,

01:19:20.417 --> 01:19:22.292
here he comes, here he comes!

01:19:23.542 --> 01:19:25.126
- Um...Marla?

01:19:25.292 --> 01:19:27.834
- Alright, Charlie, we got this!

01:19:28.001 --> 01:19:29.834
(growling softly)

01:19:34.876 --> 01:19:36.459
(growling)

01:19:36.626 --> 01:19:39.126
- Marla, is that a T-Rex?!

01:19:39.292 --> 01:19:42.001
- Charlie...run!

01:19:42.167 --> 01:19:45.001
- (both screaming)
- (roaring)

01:19:45.167 --> 01:19:47.501
(both exclaiming and panting)

01:19:47.667 --> 01:19:49.251
- Ha-ha! Turn around!

01:19:49.417 --> 01:19:50.959
(laughing)
He's behind you!

01:19:51.126 --> 01:19:53.251
- (maniacal laughter)
- (exclamations)

01:19:53.417 --> 01:19:55.292
- (crowd cheering)
- (Charlie exclaiming)

01:19:55.459 --> 01:19:58.209
- Charlie, catch!

01:19:58.376 --> 01:20:00.334
- (crowd cheering)
- (triumphant music)

01:20:00.501 --> 01:20:02.334
(exclaiming)

01:20:04.501 --> 01:20:06.626
- Stay away from my brother!

01:20:07.792 --> 01:20:10.126
- (roaring)
- (exclaiming)

01:20:10.292 --> 01:20:12.626
(grunting and exclamations)

01:20:14.667 --> 01:20:17.792
- (roaring)
- Ah! Ah!

01:20:19.334 --> 01:20:22.167
- (T-Rex snarling)
- (both exclaiming)

01:20:24.751 --> 01:20:26.626
(musical honking)

01:20:29.667 --> 01:20:33.042
- Hey! I think you're part
of my carpool.

01:20:33.209 --> 01:20:35.667
- No...way! Del!

01:20:35.834 --> 01:20:39.292
- Who ordered a food truck?!
- (musical honking)

01:20:39.459 --> 01:20:41.792
- La-la-la-la-la-la!
- Hold on!

01:20:41.959 --> 01:20:44.501
Let's make this dino...sore.

01:20:44.667 --> 01:20:47.876
- Wah-wah-wah.
- Come on, it wasn't that bad!

01:20:50.792 --> 01:20:53.084
(growling)

01:20:53.251 --> 01:20:56.584
- (exclaiming)
- (roaring)

01:21:00.501 --> 01:21:02.167
(exclamations)

01:21:02.334 --> 01:21:04.126
- (robot): Excellent!
- (laughing)

01:21:04.292 --> 01:21:07.626
- Great timing! Oh, it's so good
to see you guys!

01:21:07.792 --> 01:21:10.084
- Buckle up.
I'm getting us outta here.

01:21:10.251 --> 01:21:13.042
You're not gonna believe
what happened to me.

01:21:13.209 --> 01:21:14.501
- I met a fairy godmother.
- Hurry up!

01:21:14.667 --> 01:21:16.876
- Del, eyes on the road!
- And she gave me a wish!

01:21:17.042 --> 01:21:20.292
- Come on, you prehistoric pea-brain!
Finish them!

01:21:20.459 --> 01:21:22.751
- Del...
- ...for a thousand breakfast burritos!

01:21:22.917 --> 01:21:24.959
- So I paid Glinara back...
- It's gaining on us!

01:21:25.126 --> 01:21:26.751
- Del, focus!
- Double!

01:21:26.917 --> 01:21:29.251
And she let me use
her transporter to get back here!

01:21:29.417 --> 01:21:31.584
(screaming)
Hold on back there!

01:21:31.751 --> 01:21:33.709
- Argh! Oh!

01:21:34.917 --> 01:21:37.667
Ah! Guys! I got a plan!

01:21:41.667 --> 01:21:43.376
(grunting)

01:21:43.542 --> 01:21:45.251
(straining)

01:21:47.584 --> 01:21:49.084
- Come on!

01:21:49.251 --> 01:21:52.334
- Del, we're in position.
Are you ready?

01:21:52.501 --> 01:21:54.376
- Ready! Let's go!

01:21:54.542 --> 01:21:58.042
- Okay, brave Viking,
this one's for Mom and Dad.

01:21:58.209 --> 01:22:00.417
Let's do it
like we always used to.

01:22:00.584 --> 01:22:03.667
It's time to take down this guy
with the...

01:22:03.834 --> 01:22:06.626
- Duo...
- (both): Slingshot!

01:22:07.876 --> 01:22:09.126
(screaming)

01:22:09.292 --> 01:22:12.709
- Go, Marla!
- (screaming)

01:22:15.209 --> 01:22:17.167
Catch me, Charlie! Catch me!

01:22:17.334 --> 01:22:19.334
- Oh! Yes!
- (laughing)

01:22:22.917 --> 01:22:26.167
- Oh.
- Marla, I don't think it worked!

01:22:26.334 --> 01:22:29.584
- Ha-ha-ha!
Finally! The big finale!

01:22:29.751 --> 01:22:32.917
- (growling)
- (screaming)

01:22:38.167 --> 01:22:40.459
(crowd exclaiming and laughing)

01:22:43.084 --> 01:22:44.917
(Del): You don't see that every day.

01:22:45.084 --> 01:22:49.167
- (Charlie): Awesome! Way to go!
- (Marla): Oh, yeah! Whoo-hoo!

01:22:49.334 --> 01:22:50.751
(laughter)

01:22:52.084 --> 01:22:55.334
- What the heck is going on?! Oh!

01:22:55.501 --> 01:22:58.126
Guards, seize my prisoners!

01:22:58.292 --> 01:22:59.917
(neighing)

01:23:00.084 --> 01:23:02.917
(laughing mockingly)

01:23:05.292 --> 01:23:07.709
- (exclamations)
- Sorry we're late.

01:23:07.876 --> 01:23:10.334
Had to do a bit of vanquishing
before we arrived.

01:23:10.501 --> 01:23:13.167
- Oh, yeah! We bad!

01:23:13.334 --> 01:23:15.417
- Oh! How dare you all?!

01:23:15.584 --> 01:23:18.834
Why, if I wasn't all the way
up here on this balcony, I would...

01:23:19.001 --> 01:23:21.417
- You'd what now?
- Oh!

01:23:21.584 --> 01:23:23.501
- Believe me, we wanted a fight,

01:23:23.667 --> 01:23:27.084
but your soldiers ran away so fast.

01:23:27.251 --> 01:23:29.709
- Captain, I...I didn't see you there.
(chuckling)

01:23:29.876 --> 01:23:33.459
Uh, guards? Anyone? A little help?!

01:23:33.626 --> 01:23:36.834
- Yer days of swindlin'
and plunderin' are over,

01:23:37.001 --> 01:23:39.126
Maxi, old boy.

01:23:39.292 --> 01:23:41.334
Toss this urchin in the brig!

01:23:41.501 --> 01:23:43.251
- Aye-aye, Cap'n.

01:23:43.417 --> 01:23:45.334
- Oh! No. No, no, no!

01:23:45.501 --> 01:23:47.251
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:23:47.417 --> 01:23:49.876
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Please don't hurt me. Ah!

01:23:50.042 --> 01:23:52.917
Oh, no fair.

01:23:53.084 --> 01:23:54.667
(Bloodbones): Ha-ha! Alright!

01:23:54.834 --> 01:23:57.126
- (crowd cheering)
- Whoo-hoo!

01:23:57.292 --> 01:23:59.709
- Captain Bloodbones,
you got your crew back!

01:23:59.876 --> 01:24:02.709
- Aye, Charles!
I gave them a choice:

01:24:02.876 --> 01:24:05.334
be eaten alive
by a school of piranha,

01:24:05.501 --> 01:24:07.126
or work for me!

01:24:07.292 --> 01:24:09.917
Two of them chose the piranha!

01:24:10.084 --> 01:24:11.417
(both laughing)

01:24:11.584 --> 01:24:14.501
- Wow. Marla,
look at all these people.

01:24:14.667 --> 01:24:16.626
(crowd cheering)

01:24:16.792 --> 01:24:20.917
Oh! Who are probably hungry...

01:24:21.084 --> 01:24:23.917
...for some food from a food truck!

01:24:24.084 --> 01:24:25.459
Burritos!

01:24:25.626 --> 01:24:28.584
Meatballs and spicy burritos!

01:24:28.751 --> 01:24:31.042
- Whoo-hoo!
- (indistinct robot chatter)

01:24:31.209 --> 01:24:35.626
Come on down to Del's Belle
for the finest spicy burritos...

01:24:35.792 --> 01:24:38.001
- Let's go home, Marla.
- Sure.

01:24:38.167 --> 01:24:40.751
There's just one last thing
I have to do.

01:24:44.334 --> 01:24:45.667
- Yah!
- (crowd exclaiming)

01:24:45.834 --> 01:24:47.959
You're no one's prisoner anymore.

01:24:48.126 --> 01:24:50.584
You can fly anywhere you want.

01:24:59.501 --> 01:25:01.042
(Marla laughing)

01:25:06.126 --> 01:25:08.626
(all): Viking and knight!
Viking and knight!

01:25:08.792 --> 01:25:10.709
Viking and knight!

01:25:10.876 --> 01:25:12.834
- Yeah!
- (crowd chanting)

01:25:14.876 --> 01:25:16.417
Thanks for your help, everybody.

01:25:16.584 --> 01:25:19.292
- It was an honor, my friend.
- (Charlie laughing)

01:25:19.459 --> 01:25:21.751
- And a privilege to work with you,
Agent Marla.

01:25:21.917 --> 01:25:23.501
- (Marla laughing)
- Ook-Ook...!

01:25:23.667 --> 01:25:26.001
- Good Ook-Ook.
- (laughter)

01:25:26.167 --> 01:25:29.126
- Ook-ook-ook.
- I guess...this is goodbye.

01:25:30.876 --> 01:25:32.459
Whoa! (laughing)

01:25:32.626 --> 01:25:34.334
- Ah...
- (Marla chuckling)

01:25:34.501 --> 01:25:36.834
I'm gonna miss you, Marla.

01:25:37.001 --> 01:25:40.542
- Oh...
- I mean, I won't miss being chased,

01:25:40.709 --> 01:25:43.334
shot at, almost eaten alive.

01:25:43.501 --> 01:25:45.917
That...that was...terrifying.

01:25:46.084 --> 01:25:47.917
But I will miss you.

01:25:48.084 --> 01:25:51.834
Without you, I would never have
realized that cooking completes me.

01:25:52.001 --> 01:25:56.126
It's who I am. I mean, I'm also
a very good singer, but I...I should cook.

01:25:56.292 --> 01:25:57.751
Thank you, Marla.

01:25:57.917 --> 01:26:00.501
- Thank you, Del. I'll miss you, too.

01:26:00.667 --> 01:26:03.084
- Oh...
- Oh, it's okay, little guy.

01:26:03.251 --> 01:26:04.542
- Oh...

01:26:04.709 --> 01:26:06.834
- You won't be alone anymore.
You've got Del.

01:26:07.001 --> 01:26:08.542
- Oh?
- You're family now.

01:26:08.709 --> 01:26:11.292
- Family. Family!

01:26:11.459 --> 01:26:13.209
(both): Oh...

01:26:13.376 --> 01:26:15.917
- I wish we had more time
to get to know each other, Viking.

01:26:16.084 --> 01:26:19.709
Your moves reminded me of my cooking.
You seem like my kind of guy.

01:26:19.876 --> 01:26:22.501
- (grunting)
- Thank you so much for helping my sister.

01:26:22.667 --> 01:26:24.751
- Ah, it was nothing.
Well, it wasn't nothing.

01:26:24.917 --> 01:26:27.584
It was very dangerous,
but I'm happy to do it.

01:26:27.751 --> 01:26:29.917
So can I give you guys
a ride back?

01:26:30.084 --> 01:26:32.209
- (crowd): Burritos! Burritos!
- Um, you got some customers.

01:26:32.376 --> 01:26:34.792
- (crowd): Burritos! Burritos!
- Oh, oh, burrito man, over here!

01:26:34.959 --> 01:26:36.667
- Whoa! (laughing)
- Coming! Coming!

01:26:36.834 --> 01:26:38.376
- I'm coming, people! I'm coming.

01:26:38.542 --> 01:26:40.334
- Wait. How are we gonna
get back home?

01:26:40.501 --> 01:26:43.876
- I...think we already have a ride.

01:26:50.834 --> 01:26:53.542

put us in his stock.

to break out!
