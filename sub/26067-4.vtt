00:04.605 --> 00:07.628
Previously on The Truth About
the Harry Quebert Affair...

00:07.728 --> 00:08.549
[Harry]: What's this?

00:08.649 --> 00:09.830
It's for putting
dry bread in

00:09.930 --> 00:10.611
so you can
feed the seagulls.

00:10.691 --> 00:11.712
Oh.

00:11.812 --> 00:12.913
You have to feed the seagulls,
Harry,

00:13.013 --> 00:13.834
it's very important.

00:13.934 --> 00:14.955
All right,
I promise you,

00:15.055 --> 00:17.057
I will feed the
seagulls every day.

00:18.658 --> 00:20.560
Tell me
something sweet.

00:20.660 --> 00:22.882
Tell me I'm your...
your darling Nola.

00:22.982 --> 00:24.524
I can't.

00:24.624 --> 00:26.886
I can't do this.

00:26.986 --> 00:28.768
Well, I knew I had to
get her out of my head.

00:28.868 --> 00:30.849
So the following week,
I forced myself

00:30.949 --> 00:31.930
<i>to get closer to Jenny.</i>

00:32.030 --> 00:33.932
[Tamara Quinn]: He likes you.

00:34.032 --> 00:35.454
Oh, my gosh, stop being
a peeping tom, Mother,

00:35.554 --> 00:36.655
he's just being nice.

00:36.755 --> 00:38.096
I think he's basing
a character on you.

00:38.196 --> 00:39.257
[doorbell rings]

00:39.357 --> 00:41.579
I was hoping we could
picnic on the beach,

00:41.679 --> 00:43.741
and then find
a secluded spot to talk?

00:43.841 --> 00:45.183
I have to go to Bar Harbor.

00:45.283 --> 00:48.025
My publisher is in Camden
for the 4th.

00:48.125 --> 00:50.207
Jenny!
Mr. Quebert is here.

00:52.009 --> 00:53.550
<i>[Harry]: She was a nice girl,</i>

00:53.650 --> 00:54.912
but she wasn't Nola.

00:55.012 --> 00:58.675
I knew Harry Quebert was
obsessed with that poor girl,

00:58.775 --> 01:00.116
and I had proof.

01:00.216 --> 01:01.718
Who else knew
about you and Nola?

01:01.818 --> 01:02.839
Did Tamara Quinn?

01:02.939 --> 01:04.600
Shortly after Nola disappeared,

01:04.700 --> 01:08.164
<i>I started receiving</i>
<i>these anonymous letters,</i>

01:08.264 --> 01:10.326
<i>and then they stopped about</i>
<i>four or five months after that.</i>

01:10.426 --> 01:11.847
<i>I don't know why they stopped,</i>
<i>but they stopped.</i>

01:11.947 --> 01:13.729
No! I-I got it!

01:13.829 --> 01:15.130
Nola, are those bruises?

01:15.230 --> 01:16.251
It's my mom.

01:16.351 --> 01:18.693
She hit me when I got back
from Bar Harbor.

01:18.793 --> 01:19.854
Your mom?

01:19.954 --> 01:22.136
She says I'm a wicked girl.

01:22.236 --> 01:23.658
That's crazy.

01:23.758 --> 01:25.299
No, she wanted to
teach me a lesson,

01:25.399 --> 01:27.101
and she's right.

01:27.201 --> 01:29.103
I am a wicked girl.

01:29.203 --> 01:30.824
Nola did tell me
about an older man

01:30.924 --> 01:32.026
she was involved with
that summer.

01:32.126 --> 01:33.507
Do you remember his name?

01:33.607 --> 01:35.028
There's no way
I'd ever forget it.

01:35.128 --> 01:37.130
He's one of the richest men
in Maine.

01:40.413 --> 01:43.536
[âªâªâªâªâª]

02:46.714 --> 02:47.895
[Gahalowood sighs]

02:47.995 --> 02:49.897
Just what I need
first thing in the morning.

02:49.997 --> 02:52.099
You are not gonna believe
what I found out.

02:52.199 --> 02:54.201
[sighing]

02:59.365 --> 03:01.227
Look, writer,

03:01.327 --> 03:03.029
I don't want you complicating
this investigation

03:03.129 --> 03:06.072
with any of your crazy
unproven leads.

03:06.172 --> 03:07.033
What if Nola Kellergan

03:07.133 --> 03:08.013
wasn't the perfect
little angel

03:08.093 --> 03:09.275
everyone says she was?

03:09.375 --> 03:11.397
Now, we know about
her and Harry,

03:11.497 --> 03:13.238
but it turns out,

03:13.338 --> 03:14.279
she was having
secret rendezvous

03:14.379 --> 03:16.281
with another older man
at the same time.

03:16.381 --> 03:17.402
And how do you
know this?

03:17.502 --> 03:18.763
Nancy Hattaway,

03:18.863 --> 03:20.865
Nola's best friend
when they were 15.

03:21.266 --> 03:22.687
That doesn't make it true.

03:22.787 --> 03:25.349
When you're 15, you tell
other people all kinds of shit.

03:28.552 --> 03:30.554
Gimme.

03:32.996 --> 03:34.858
Now...

03:34.958 --> 03:36.780
does this Bachelor #2
have a name?

03:36.880 --> 03:37.821
Yeah.

03:37.921 --> 03:40.363
Um, Elijah Stern.

03:43.326 --> 03:44.987
Are you out of
your mind, writer?

03:45.087 --> 03:47.029
You're talking about
one of the richest,

03:47.129 --> 03:49.872
most respected men in the state.

03:49.972 --> 03:51.633
The heir to a damn empire.

03:51.733 --> 03:53.355
Now, unless you have
solid evidence,

03:53.455 --> 03:54.676
I'm not about
to cross swords

03:54.776 --> 03:56.118
with a guy who plays golf
with the governor.

03:56.218 --> 03:58.219
Okay.

03:59.541 --> 04:00.722
I found those

04:00.822 --> 04:03.084
hidden in the house
at Goose Cove.

04:03.184 --> 04:03.965
We searched the house.

04:04.065 --> 04:05.046
Yeah.

04:05.146 --> 04:06.807
Oh, you searched
the house?

04:06.907 --> 04:08.089
Yeah, we searched the house.

04:08.189 --> 04:09.049
Yeah, well,
searching a house

04:09.149 --> 04:10.691
isn't the same
as living in it, okay?

04:10.791 --> 04:13.814
Glad you didn't
evict me now?

04:13.914 --> 04:16.656
"I know what you've done
with that 15-year-old girl,

04:16.756 --> 04:18.778
and soon the whole
town will know."

04:18.878 --> 04:20.100
They're all
the same, okay?

04:20.200 --> 04:21.261
Harry started
receiving those

04:21.361 --> 04:22.902
shortly after
Nola disappeared.

04:23.002 --> 04:25.384
Someone knew about them,
Sergeant,

04:25.484 --> 04:26.826
someone who wanted
to get back at him,

04:26.926 --> 04:28.507
someone who might have
killed Nola

04:28.607 --> 04:30.349
the night she was on her way
to the motel to meet him.

04:30.449 --> 04:31.670
Excuse me, what?

04:31.770 --> 04:33.752
Harry... [sighs]

04:33.852 --> 04:35.914
Harry was waiting for her
at the By the Sea Motel

04:36.014 --> 04:36.835
in Room 8, okay?

04:36.935 --> 04:38.396
He said Nola had
sent him a letter

04:38.496 --> 04:39.517
saying that
she'd meet him there,

04:39.617 --> 04:41.359
but she never showed up.

04:41.459 --> 04:43.461
And where's that letter?

04:45.062 --> 04:47.064
I don't know, it disappeared.

04:48.586 --> 04:50.007
Look, the point is, Sergeant,

04:50.107 --> 04:51.769
Nola Kellergan
never showed up, okay?

04:51.869 --> 04:53.050
That means she was killed

04:53.150 --> 04:55.132
on her way to the motel
to meet Harry.

04:55.232 --> 04:58.094
So some maniac kills her,

04:58.194 --> 05:00.296
buries her in Quebert's backyard

05:00.396 --> 05:01.297
with a copy

05:01.397 --> 05:03.059
of Quebert's manuscript,

05:03.159 --> 05:04.220
but it isn't Quebert?

05:04.320 --> 05:06.342
Yeah.

05:06.442 --> 05:07.343
I don't think so.
[knock on door]

05:07.443 --> 05:09.024
Yeah?

05:09.124 --> 05:10.866
You're due
in Portland at 10:00.

05:10.966 --> 05:12.788
I guess time fucking flies

05:12.888 --> 05:14.910
when you're having
this much fun, huh?

05:15.010 --> 05:16.191
Aren't...

05:16.291 --> 05:17.712
aren't you gonna
follow this up?

05:17.812 --> 05:22.277
Sergeant, if Elijah Stern
wrote these letters...

05:22.377 --> 05:24.358
You're grasping at straws.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.120
Whoever wrote
"Goodbye, darling Nola"

05:26.220 --> 05:28.202
is most likely the killer.

05:28.302 --> 05:30.124
See what the writing
analysis tells us

05:30.224 --> 05:31.005
before you go around

05:31.105 --> 05:33.727
accusing innocent people
of murder.

05:33.827 --> 05:35.449
<i>[Roth]: So you mean</i>
<i>that Elijah Stern,</i>

05:35.549 --> 05:36.850
<i>the pillar of the community,</i>

05:36.950 --> 05:38.852
<i>turns out to be</i>
<i>a dirty old man?</i>

05:38.952 --> 05:40.253
[Marcus]: Yeah,
sure looks like it.

05:40.353 --> 05:41.774
<i>[Roth]:</i>
<i>Not good enough, Goldman.</i>

05:41.874 --> 05:42.976
<i>Not good enough.</i>

05:43.076 --> 05:45.097
Guys like Stern fall in love

05:45.197 --> 05:46.739
with their own reputations.

05:46.839 --> 05:48.501
<i>If he even</i>
<i>gets the sense</i>

05:48.601 --> 05:50.182
<i>that you think of</i>
<i>him as a suspect,</i>

05:50.282 --> 05:53.465
he'll slap you with
a defamatory per se

05:53.565 --> 05:55.987
before he can sic one of
his big Rottweilers on you,

05:56.087 --> 05:57.549
who are trained to go
for your nuts,

05:57.649 --> 06:00.912
<i>and you won't be able</i>
<i>to claim shit</i>

06:01.012 --> 06:03.434
<i>for turning into</i>
<i>a boy soprano</i>

06:03.534 --> 06:04.315
because, technically,

06:04.415 --> 06:05.316
you're trespassing.

06:05.416 --> 06:06.277
Could you put some of that

06:06.377 --> 06:07.478
skin softener on there,

06:07.578 --> 06:08.559
the pink stuff?

06:08.659 --> 06:10.000
Yeah...

06:10.100 --> 06:11.241
No, I wasn't talking to you.

06:11.341 --> 06:13.964
<i>And after he sics</i>
<i>his dogs on you,</i>

06:14.064 --> 06:15.886
then he'll go for your throat.

06:15.986 --> 06:17.047
He'll sue you for libel,

06:17.147 --> 06:18.168
for slander,

06:18.268 --> 06:19.369
for defamation of character--

06:19.469 --> 06:20.170
<i>[Marcus]: Well, what am I</i>

06:20.270 --> 06:21.130
<i>supposed to do, then?</i>

06:21.230 --> 06:22.211
<i>Just sit back and do nothing?</i>

06:22.311 --> 06:24.854
Well, uh... play it safe

06:24.954 --> 06:25.935
for the time being.

06:26.035 --> 06:27.897
Go after your other leads.

06:27.997 --> 06:30.779
<i>And don't go after Stern</i>

06:30.879 --> 06:32.781
<i>unless you've got</i>
<i>some real evidence,</i>

06:32.881 --> 06:34.903
<i>unless you want</i>
<i>a permanent position</i>

06:35.003 --> 06:37.005
<i>with the Vienna</i>
<i>Boys' Choir.</i>

06:40.008 --> 06:42.270
She was beaten, yes,
I knew about it.

06:42.370 --> 06:44.992
I saw the bruises.

06:45.092 --> 06:46.994
It was horrendous.

06:47.094 --> 06:48.916
You never reported it?

06:49.016 --> 06:50.477
She begged me not to.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.479
What else did Nancy say?

06:52.579 --> 06:56.123
She said that, um,

06:56.223 --> 07:01.327
that Nola seemed
very depressed that summer.

07:01.427 --> 07:02.448
Yeah, on the 4th,

07:02.548 --> 07:04.810
I took Jenny
to see the fireworks.

07:04.910 --> 07:08.814
That changed her
mood dramatically.

07:08.914 --> 07:11.977
Her letters...

07:12.077 --> 07:14.419
are heartbreaking.

07:14.519 --> 07:16.141
The, uh...

07:16.241 --> 07:18.183
the 4th of July,
the letters, the beatings--

07:18.283 --> 07:20.825
that's all in
<i>The Origin of Evil,</i> right?

07:20.925 --> 07:23.347
It's all there,
Marcus, yeah.

07:23.447 --> 07:26.230
It's all there.

07:26.330 --> 07:29.393
So many people
have analyzed the novel,

07:29.493 --> 07:31.635
and the symbolism,

07:31.735 --> 07:33.997
the allegories,

07:34.097 --> 07:36.560
all of it.

07:36.660 --> 07:38.842
It was just a simple story

07:38.942 --> 07:42.825
about Nola and me.

07:52.434 --> 07:54.436
Want more coffee?

08:01.362 --> 08:03.804
[sniffling]

08:09.970 --> 08:11.972
What are you hiding
from me, Nola?

08:12.813 --> 08:15.515
I'm not hiding anything
from you, Mother.

08:15.615 --> 08:18.458
I promise.

08:20.099 --> 08:22.562
[screeching]
Don't you lie to me!

08:22.662 --> 08:24.283
You think
I haven't noticed?

08:24.383 --> 08:25.284
Of course not.

08:25.384 --> 08:26.605
Out all the time,

08:26.705 --> 08:28.127
covered in makeup
like a damn whore!

08:28.227 --> 08:30.229
[Nola screams]

08:31.710 --> 08:34.232
[screaming] No! No!

08:35.514 --> 08:36.735
[door slams]

08:36.835 --> 08:38.837
[muffled screams]

08:39.597 --> 08:40.458
Take off
your clothes!

08:40.558 --> 08:41.459
No.

08:41.559 --> 08:44.041
Take them off!

08:45.162 --> 08:47.164
Okay.

08:51.088 --> 08:52.709
Why are you wearing
a brassiere?

08:52.809 --> 08:54.111
I have breasts.

08:54.211 --> 08:55.632
You're too young
to have breasts!

08:55.732 --> 08:57.734
Take it off!

09:01.337 --> 09:04.080
[Nola screaming]
No!

09:04.180 --> 09:05.241
[turns up music]

09:05.341 --> 09:07.643
[Nola screaming,
music from garage blasting]

09:07.743 --> 09:09.044
Do you understand?

09:09.144 --> 09:10.245
[music blaring]

09:10.345 --> 09:11.607
I don't wanna!

09:11.707 --> 09:13.128
-Take it off!
-No!

09:13.228 --> 09:15.530
Don't make me!

09:15.630 --> 09:19.634
[music is loud,
but beating is louder]

09:27.441 --> 09:28.622
[knock on door]
Nola?

09:28.722 --> 09:29.703
Just a minute!

09:29.803 --> 09:31.585
The place is packed.
We need you!

09:31.685 --> 09:34.067
Just a minute.

09:34.167 --> 09:35.388
I just happened
to be passing by,

09:35.488 --> 09:36.790
and I see that Minnie's
the only one on the floor,

09:36.890 --> 09:40.954
and she said that you've been
in the bathroom forever.

09:41.054 --> 09:42.155
Nola?
[knocking]

09:42.255 --> 09:43.116
Yes!

09:43.216 --> 09:46.038
What's going on?

09:46.138 --> 09:48.120
Nola, have you
been crying?

09:48.220 --> 09:49.722
I just don't
feel so well.

09:49.822 --> 09:53.085
Aw... I'll give you a hand
during the rush, okay?

09:53.185 --> 09:55.046
They're going crazy
in the kitchen.

09:55.146 --> 09:57.148
Just quick as you can.

10:15.725 --> 10:18.228
Hey.

10:18.328 --> 10:19.989
[chuckling fondly]

10:20.089 --> 10:21.831
I added some sugar.

10:21.931 --> 10:23.933
Thank you.

10:25.775 --> 10:28.317
You won't tell your mom

10:28.417 --> 10:29.678
that I screwed up today,
will you?

10:29.778 --> 10:30.759
Please.

10:30.859 --> 10:32.941
Come on, let's sit.

10:36.264 --> 10:38.546
Sometimes it helps
just to talk about it.

10:39.787 --> 10:42.290
My heart's just a little
broken, that's all.

10:42.390 --> 10:45.733
Aw, honey...

10:45.833 --> 10:47.775
You'll find
the right guy some day.

10:47.875 --> 10:49.056
Trust me.

10:49.156 --> 10:50.337
When I was your age,

10:50.437 --> 10:54.621
I thought I was in love
like, a bunch of times,

10:54.721 --> 10:56.383
and I, uh...

10:56.483 --> 10:58.144
and now I realize

10:58.244 --> 11:01.627
that those experiences
were just...

11:01.727 --> 11:03.309
they were just
preparing me for Harry.

11:03.409 --> 11:05.511
Harry?

11:05.611 --> 11:07.193
Harry Quebert.

11:07.293 --> 11:09.154
[giggles]

11:09.254 --> 11:10.396
I know...

11:10.496 --> 11:11.557
I shouldn't even
be telling you,

11:11.657 --> 11:13.278
'cause it's all very new
and everything, but...

11:13.378 --> 11:16.801
Yeah, um, I just thought

11:16.901 --> 11:20.445
that you looked
really sad and hopeless.

11:20.545 --> 11:23.087
Last night, he took me to
Augusta for the fireworks,

11:23.187 --> 11:25.089
and it was so romantic.

11:25.189 --> 11:27.771
And you know his book?

11:27.871 --> 11:29.693
Well, I'm pretty sure
that I'm the main character.

11:29.793 --> 11:32.055
Like, he's too shy
to just come out and say it,

11:32.155 --> 11:34.137
but he's always looking at me,
and then, like,

11:34.237 --> 11:36.580
scribbling
something down, and...

11:36.680 --> 11:39.782
[giggles]

11:39.882 --> 11:41.544
He took you out last night?

11:41.644 --> 11:43.586
Mm-hm, but you can't
tell anyone, okay?

11:43.686 --> 11:45.067
Not till it's, like, official.

11:45.167 --> 11:46.869
Yeah.

11:46.969 --> 11:49.351
Anyway, I just thought
I would, you know, tell you

11:49.451 --> 11:53.435
as... as proof that good things
are on their way.

11:53.535 --> 11:55.757
Thank you.

11:55.857 --> 11:57.839
You can finish that.

11:57.939 --> 12:00.281
I'm gonna go clean this up.

12:00.381 --> 12:02.383
Okay.

13:32.946 --> 13:36.850
So the first letter
she wrote you was on...

13:36.950 --> 13:38.972
July 5th.

13:39.072 --> 13:42.575
She found out from Jenny
we went to the fireworks.

13:42.675 --> 13:45.718
Next day, it got worse.

13:47.840 --> 13:49.842
[knocks gently]

13:50.762 --> 13:52.764
Nola?

13:54.446 --> 13:56.448
Nola, can I come in?

13:59.490 --> 14:01.492
[quiet sobbing]

14:18.628 --> 14:20.630
What's the matter,
sweetheart?

14:23.953 --> 14:26.375
It's Mom.

14:26.475 --> 14:29.958
She hurt me again.

14:36.124 --> 14:39.227
Hey...

14:39.327 --> 14:42.230
How about we go
to the movies?

14:42.330 --> 14:44.432
<i>The Return</i>
<i>of the Pink Panther.</i>

14:44.532 --> 14:47.454
I remember how much
you liked the first one.

14:51.498 --> 14:53.560
Now, what do you say?

14:53.660 --> 14:56.783
You, me, and a bucket
of popcorn, hmm?

15:06.352 --> 15:08.353
Okay.

15:15.200 --> 15:18.103
And there's our Jenny
at her dance recital.

15:18.203 --> 15:19.304
She won the gold ribbon

15:19.404 --> 15:21.386
for best
pointe solo that year.

15:21.486 --> 15:23.387
That's because that other
little girl was pushed

15:23.487 --> 15:24.108
and broke her ankle.

15:24.208 --> 15:25.349
Tripped.

15:25.449 --> 15:26.750
Pushing
was never proven.

15:26.850 --> 15:28.952
Yeah.

15:29.052 --> 15:31.635
Oh, and there she is,
our little Olga Korbut.

15:31.735 --> 15:32.436
So much talent.

15:32.536 --> 15:33.997
Yes.

15:34.097 --> 15:35.919
[gasps]
God, not the photo albums.

15:36.019 --> 15:37.640
It must be boring you to tears.

15:37.740 --> 15:39.682
Oh, not at all.

15:39.782 --> 15:40.803
I think
you look lovely.

15:40.903 --> 15:41.844
Doesn't she,
Mr. Quebert?

15:41.944 --> 15:43.946
Yes.

15:44.747 --> 15:45.688
Should we go?

15:45.788 --> 15:46.629
Yes, we should
probably go, I think.

15:46.709 --> 15:49.411
-Okay.
-Okay, well, thank you.

15:49.511 --> 15:50.973
I just have to get
my purse, and then...

15:51.073 --> 15:51.813
Okay.

15:51.913 --> 15:53.495
Okay.

15:53.595 --> 15:55.497
I thought about buying
this model last year,

15:55.597 --> 15:57.539
but my wife said
it made me look like a pimp.

15:57.639 --> 15:58.740
No offense.

15:58.840 --> 16:00.141
All right,
that's enough man talk.

16:00.241 --> 16:01.382
You don't wanna be late.

16:01.482 --> 16:03.024
Oh, and Mr. Quebert,

16:03.124 --> 16:04.705
I do hope that
you'd be free on Sunday

16:04.805 --> 16:06.387
to come to
a garden party?

16:06.487 --> 16:09.550
As our guest of honor,
of course.

16:09.650 --> 16:10.911
Uh, yes, I...

16:11.011 --> 16:12.392
I think I am,
actually.

16:12.492 --> 16:13.673
Excellent.

16:13.773 --> 16:16.156
It's nothing fussy,
just a little country lunch

16:16.256 --> 16:18.358
and a few nice people,

16:18.458 --> 16:20.360
people who have known Jenny
all her life--

16:20.460 --> 16:21.481
[starting engine]

16:21.581 --> 16:23.603
Well, really nice
seeing you both, and I...

16:23.703 --> 16:27.886
I, uh, I'll get your daughter
back at a reasonable hour.

16:27.986 --> 16:29.988
Oh, take all the
time you need.

16:39.597 --> 16:40.037
Why don't you find us
a couple seats?

16:40.118 --> 16:42.440
I'll get the popcorn.

16:51.048 --> 16:51.948
[giggles]
I'm so excited.

16:52.048 --> 16:53.390
Yeah...

16:53.490 --> 16:56.513
Oh, uh, so I'm going...

16:56.613 --> 16:57.594
I'm gonna meet you inside,

16:57.694 --> 16:58.414
'cause I'm gonna visit
the ladies' room.

16:58.494 --> 16:59.475
Okay, there's
your ticket.

16:59.575 --> 17:00.396
I'll try and
get some seats.

17:00.496 --> 17:02.498
Okay.

17:02.898 --> 17:04.900
Thank you.

17:23.637 --> 17:25.639
Harry, let's not sit
too close to the front.

17:27.761 --> 17:29.143
Yeah, no, let me get
some popcorn.

17:29.243 --> 17:30.143
Why don't you
find us seats?

17:30.243 --> 17:32.245
Okay, no butter, please,
and-and a Tab?

17:45.097 --> 17:47.099
Don't be angry
with me, Nola.

17:49.301 --> 17:51.803
Did you have a good
time with your publisher?

17:51.903 --> 17:54.566
Just go back
to your girlfriend.

17:54.666 --> 17:56.848
She already
told me everything.

17:56.948 --> 17:58.950
I shouldn't have
lied to you, I'm sorry.

17:59.791 --> 18:01.792
[slapping]

18:15.765 --> 18:18.188
Oh, my God,
I was so hungry.

18:18.288 --> 18:20.269
I guess funny movies
really give me an appetite.

18:20.369 --> 18:21.551
[giggles]

18:21.651 --> 18:22.872
Oh, I just love
Inspector Clouseau,

18:22.972 --> 18:23.753
don't you?

18:23.853 --> 18:24.754
Mm-hm.

18:24.854 --> 18:26.035
"Is that your monkey?"

18:26.135 --> 18:29.198
[laughing]
It's hilarious!

18:29.298 --> 18:31.299
So good...

18:33.982 --> 18:35.603
Harry, don't take me
home right away.

18:35.703 --> 18:38.806
Let's go to the beach.

18:38.906 --> 18:40.568
The beach?

18:40.668 --> 18:41.569
Yeah, we could...

18:41.669 --> 18:43.090
we could park nearby,

18:43.190 --> 18:46.233
and look at the stars,
take a walk...

18:47.955 --> 18:49.977
We could go skinny-dipping,

18:50.077 --> 18:52.319
our bodies bathed in moonlight.

18:53.680 --> 18:54.501
Oh, Jenny, I--

18:54.601 --> 18:56.623
Or-or how about
Side Creek Lane,

18:56.723 --> 18:58.625
by the woods?

18:58.725 --> 19:02.328
It's got a beautiful view
and a lovely place to park.

19:04.650 --> 19:06.632
I'd really like to show you.
-Okay.

19:06.732 --> 19:09.274
There's a really nice
quiet spot over here,

19:09.374 --> 19:11.376
by the trees.

19:14.379 --> 19:18.142
No one's gonna
bother us here.

19:28.352 --> 19:30.574
I feel like I'm in
high school again.

19:30.674 --> 19:32.676
[giggles]

19:36.239 --> 19:38.241
[whispering]
It's okay, I want to.

19:52.334 --> 19:54.676
I want you as much
as you want me.

19:54.776 --> 19:56.357
I can't.

19:56.457 --> 19:58.459
I can't...

20:00.461 --> 20:02.603
This isn't right.

20:02.703 --> 20:04.705
Jenny, I can't.

20:05.626 --> 20:07.908
I'm sorry.

20:13.113 --> 20:15.655
I'm sorry.

20:15.755 --> 20:17.897
Jenny, you're
a beautiful woman.

20:17.997 --> 20:18.938
I had a lovely time tonight.

20:19.038 --> 20:21.340
It's just that I...

20:21.440 --> 20:23.062
I'm...

20:23.162 --> 20:25.784
I'm distracted.

20:25.884 --> 20:28.207
My mind is
on my writing.

20:29.888 --> 20:32.931
You deserve better than that.

20:36.214 --> 20:38.216
It's okay.

20:40.978 --> 20:42.980
I understand.

20:44.662 --> 20:45.883
You're an artist,

20:45.983 --> 20:48.865
and your book is all
you can think about.

20:55.912 --> 20:58.594
When will it be finished?

21:00.516 --> 21:02.518
I don't know.

21:03.799 --> 21:05.801
[starts engine]

21:17.171 --> 21:19.233
All right, well, um,
good night, Harry.

21:19.333 --> 21:20.194
Good night.

21:20.294 --> 21:21.075
Thanks for
a good night.

21:21.175 --> 21:22.637
Yeah.

21:22.737 --> 21:24.738
-Okay.
-Okay.

21:52.524 --> 21:54.426
Everything okay, Jenny?

21:54.526 --> 21:55.947
Fine.

21:56.047 --> 21:57.669
Travis, what
are you doing here?

21:57.769 --> 21:58.790
Just night rounds.

21:58.890 --> 22:01.072
Did you, uh, did you
go out somewhere fancy?

22:01.172 --> 22:03.914
Uh, prom queen reunion.

22:04.014 --> 22:06.016
I have them
every couple years.

22:08.458 --> 22:11.241
Hey, so, um,
I was just wondering--

22:11.341 --> 22:13.083
[Tamara calls]:
Is that you, Jenny?

22:13.183 --> 22:14.884
Travis, I...
I gotta go.

22:14.984 --> 22:16.646
Thanks for keeping
an eye on things.

22:16.746 --> 22:18.748
Night, now.

22:23.913 --> 22:25.734
[sniffling]

22:25.834 --> 22:28.757
[ringing doorbell]

22:35.363 --> 22:38.246
[knocking]

22:40.448 --> 22:42.450
[banging]

22:43.771 --> 22:45.312
Harry?

22:45.412 --> 22:48.355
[banging]

22:48.455 --> 22:50.457
Open up, Harry!

23:00.947 --> 23:03.969
I'm sorry I hit you.

23:04.069 --> 23:06.071
I didn't mean to hit you.

23:08.273 --> 23:11.556
Please, please
open up, Harry!

23:21.846 --> 23:24.248
Can we just please
forgive each other?

23:33.616 --> 23:35.618
[sighs]

24:21.220 --> 24:24.043
[sirens wailing]

24:24.143 --> 24:25.244
Where do you
think you're going?

24:25.344 --> 24:26.445
With you, where else?

24:26.545 --> 24:27.606
This isn't
a social call, woman.

24:27.706 --> 24:28.967
You stay put.

24:29.067 --> 24:30.248
And don't go blabbing
to anyone, you hear me?

24:30.348 --> 24:31.329
Blabbing?

24:31.429 --> 24:33.431
What am I,
the town gossip?

24:35.193 --> 24:36.814
Connie?

24:36.914 --> 24:38.896
Maggie Pratt.

24:38.996 --> 24:40.298
I have the most
devastating news.

24:40.398 --> 24:43.240
[siren wailing]

24:48.645 --> 24:49.946
You got
the trauma kit?

24:50.046 --> 24:51.948
Yeah.

24:52.048 --> 24:54.130
Reverend, I'm so
sorry about Nola.

25:07.062 --> 25:09.845
That's enough
for today, Marcus.

25:09.945 --> 25:12.107
That's enough.

25:17.271 --> 25:20.615
You don't marry
the condiments anymore?

25:20.715 --> 25:21.675
You know, I wouldn't have
sold you the place

25:21.756 --> 25:22.817
if I'd thought
you were gonna turn it

25:22.917 --> 25:25.339
into a third-rate
greasy spoon.

25:25.439 --> 25:28.982
I'm sorry it isn't up
to your standards, Mother.

25:29.082 --> 25:31.304
Feel free to patronize
another diner

25:31.404 --> 25:32.826
that suits you.

25:32.926 --> 25:35.428
Preferably
in another state.

25:35.528 --> 25:38.431
When I owned it,
it was a destination.

25:38.531 --> 25:41.314
We were listed in
Fodor's, for God's sake.

25:41.414 --> 25:43.596
We still are, Mother.

25:43.696 --> 25:46.959
Couple of girls
are sick, that's all.

25:47.059 --> 25:49.161
Here, try the lemon cake.

25:49.261 --> 25:51.923
On the house.

25:52.023 --> 25:53.365
What can I
get you, Marcus?

25:53.465 --> 25:55.006
Just a burger,
thanks.

25:55.106 --> 25:56.487
With fries...
The usual.

25:56.587 --> 25:58.449
Thanks.

25:58.549 --> 26:00.972
I know you.

26:01.072 --> 26:02.493
You're that little
son of a bitch

26:02.593 --> 26:04.255
that was always
trailing after Quebert

26:04.355 --> 26:06.336
like a lost puppy.

26:06.436 --> 26:07.578
Yes, ma'am.

26:07.678 --> 26:09.179
That, uh...
that's right.

26:09.279 --> 26:11.421
Mom, this is
Marcus Goldman.

26:11.521 --> 26:14.624
He's a well-known
writer now.

26:14.724 --> 26:16.466
Oh.

26:16.566 --> 26:19.028
Ah, you're grown up
since I last saw you.

26:19.128 --> 26:20.870
Sort of good-lookin'.

26:20.970 --> 26:22.952
Well, I appreciate
the compliment.

26:23.052 --> 26:25.314
In a New York
sort of way.

26:25.414 --> 26:29.318
And the anti-Semitic
euphemism.

26:29.418 --> 26:32.681
You know, I hope they
make that monster suffer

26:32.781 --> 26:34.002
the way he did
that poor girl--

26:34.102 --> 26:36.184
Mother,
that's enough.

26:41.789 --> 26:45.372
You know,
you are a writer.

26:45.472 --> 26:46.533
Why don't you
write the truth

26:46.633 --> 26:49.076
about that twisted
son of a bitch?

26:50.837 --> 26:52.739
He killed Nola.

26:52.839 --> 26:55.221
And--

26:55.321 --> 26:57.543
And he killed
Mrs. Cooper,

26:57.643 --> 27:00.106
and in some ways...

27:00.206 --> 27:02.388
he killed
my Jenny, too.

27:02.488 --> 27:04.750
<i>[Tamara continues]: You see,</i>
<i>on a Sunday in July,</i>

27:04.850 --> 27:06.111
<i>I hosted a garden party</i>

27:06.211 --> 27:07.913
<i>that should've been</i>
<i>a proud day for me,</i>

27:08.013 --> 27:09.154
<i>and for Jenny.</i>

27:09.254 --> 27:10.435
<i>I invited all</i>

27:10.535 --> 27:11.997

27:12.097 --> 27:15.039
<i>The mayor, chief of police,</i>

27:15.139 --> 27:16.921
<i>I promised them a big surprise.</i>

27:17.021 --> 27:19.243
<i>I knew their eyes would pop</i>
<i>out of their heads</i>

27:19.343 --> 27:22.246
<i>when they saw</i>

27:22.346 --> 27:24.768
<i>Mr. Harry Quebert, saunter in.</i>

27:24.868 --> 27:26.450
<i>"What's he doing here?"</i>

27:26.550 --> 27:29.773
<i>"Oh, he and my Jenny</i>

27:29.873 --> 27:31.094
Oh, is everyone
here okay

27:31.194 --> 27:31.995
with your welcome
cocktails?

27:32.075 --> 27:34.217
It's our third one.

27:34.317 --> 27:35.138
Oh, well,
welcome.

27:35.238 --> 27:35.979
[laughing]

27:36.079 --> 27:38.141
Honey?

27:38.241 --> 27:39.182
Mom, I don't think he's coming.

27:39.282 --> 27:40.463
Of course he is.

27:40.563 --> 27:42.785
I'm sure he just got
caught up with his writing.

27:42.885 --> 27:44.026
No, no,
I just called,

27:44.126 --> 27:45.708
and he's not there.

27:45.808 --> 27:46.528
I'm sure he'll
be here, my love--

27:46.608 --> 27:47.709
Look at you,

27:47.809 --> 27:48.850
you're about to meet
your future son-in-law,

27:48.930 --> 27:50.592
and you're just lookin'
like a drifter.

27:50.692 --> 27:51.513
Okay, there you go.

27:51.613 --> 27:52.394
Go talk to people,

27:52.494 --> 27:53.995
mingle, don't be shy.

27:54.095 --> 27:54.996
[chuckles]

27:55.096 --> 27:57.098
I'm gonna call.

27:57.458 --> 28:00.441
<i>[Tamara]: That day</i>
<i>he did everything he could</i>

28:00.541 --> 28:03.164
<i>to dishonor the good name</i>
<i>of our family...</i>

28:03.264 --> 28:05.446
Tamara, darling,

28:05.546 --> 28:07.167
your party is pure perfection.

28:07.267 --> 28:08.328
[chuckles]

28:08.428 --> 28:11.291
I just feel so badly
it's been overshadowed

28:11.391 --> 28:12.572
by the tragic news

28:12.672 --> 28:14.974
of that Kellergan girl's
suicide attempt.

28:15.074 --> 28:17.617
I'm just so relieved
that she's gonna be okay.

28:17.717 --> 28:19.178
By the way, you two,

28:19.278 --> 28:21.540
you really know
how to put on the dog.

28:21.640 --> 28:25.104
Steamers, lobster,
sirloin tips?

28:25.204 --> 28:26.705
Who the hell's
getting married?

28:26.805 --> 28:28.307
[laughter]

28:28.407 --> 28:29.508
Excuse me.

28:29.608 --> 28:31.109
So, tell us already.

28:31.209 --> 28:32.631
What are we supposed
to be celebrating?

28:32.731 --> 28:35.253
Um...

28:38.416 --> 28:40.418
My dear friends...

28:40.898 --> 28:43.681
the reason we called
you all here was, uh,

28:43.781 --> 28:48.085
to announce that...

28:48.185 --> 28:50.767
we have a new color television.

28:50.867 --> 28:52.128
[laughter]

28:52.228 --> 28:54.050
Bob has cancer!

28:54.150 --> 28:56.172
He's gonna die.

28:56.272 --> 28:57.493
What? I...

28:57.593 --> 28:59.295
I have cancer?

28:59.395 --> 29:00.536
You do, my dearest.

29:00.636 --> 29:02.178
But...

29:02.278 --> 29:04.300
I thought we were
gonna announce--

29:04.400 --> 29:05.621
I know you did, my love,

29:05.721 --> 29:08.303
but I just thought it
would be easier to tell you

29:08.403 --> 29:10.405
among our nearest and dearest.

29:11.366 --> 29:14.709
It's times like these that...

29:14.809 --> 29:17.151
it's important to have
one's friends around us

29:17.251 --> 29:20.835
to remind us
that we're not alone.

29:20.935 --> 29:22.196
[crowd gasps]

29:22.296 --> 29:24.298
We'll never
forget you, Bob.

29:34.147 --> 29:36.049
Mr. Quebert.

29:36.149 --> 29:38.211
Oh, Reverend.

29:38.311 --> 29:41.093
I, uh, heard about Nola.

29:41.193 --> 29:42.134
Is she all right?

29:42.234 --> 29:43.776
Very kind
of you to come.

29:43.876 --> 29:45.537
You probably heard

29:45.637 --> 29:47.579
she tried to
commit suicide.

29:47.679 --> 29:48.860
Yes, I did.

29:48.960 --> 29:51.183
Yeah, rumors...

29:51.283 --> 29:52.704
It's the price you pay
for living in a small town.

29:52.804 --> 29:53.905
Ah...

29:54.005 --> 29:56.788
She, uh...
she had a headache,

29:56.888 --> 29:58.629
and she picked up
the wrong medicine.

29:58.729 --> 29:59.630
Oh.

29:59.730 --> 30:01.192
Oh, well,
that makes sense.

30:01.292 --> 30:04.635
Well, please give her,
uh, my regards.

30:04.735 --> 30:05.836
Very good of you.

30:05.936 --> 30:08.398
I'll, uh, I'll give
her the message.

30:08.498 --> 30:10.921
She shouldn't have
too many visitors right now.

30:11.021 --> 30:12.282
I'm sure you understand.

30:12.382 --> 30:14.384
Oh yes, of course.

32:23.102 --> 32:26.365
Did you ever find out
where he was?

32:26.465 --> 32:30.328
Ah... seducing some
other teenaged girl,

32:30.428 --> 32:32.010
for all I know.

32:32.110 --> 32:33.651
And my Jenny...

32:33.751 --> 32:35.753
was destroyed.

32:37.435 --> 32:39.437
Devastated.

32:54.370 --> 32:56.592
[muttering] That's right...

32:56.692 --> 32:58.694
[rings doorbell]

33:00.896 --> 33:02.898
[rings doorbell]

33:04.460 --> 33:05.881
[knocking firmly] Quebert?

33:05.981 --> 33:07.082
Quebert!

33:07.182 --> 33:09.184
[banging]

33:09.704 --> 33:11.686
[opening door]

33:11.786 --> 33:13.788
Huh...

33:16.350 --> 33:18.352
Quebert?

33:58.389 --> 33:59.890
[exhales]

33:59.990 --> 34:01.772
"Nola..."

34:01.872 --> 34:04.094
"Nola, my darling"?

34:04.194 --> 34:06.276
"Were you to die,
where would my love go?"

34:20.449 --> 34:22.451
[sighs]

34:40.868 --> 34:42.870
<i>That made me wanna puke.</i>

34:43.871 --> 34:44.932
Well, what, it never
crossed your mind

34:45.032 --> 34:47.974
they might have
loved each other?

34:48.074 --> 34:50.076
Loved each other?

34:50.997 --> 34:53.500
There's no way that
innocent little child

34:53.600 --> 34:55.181
would've...

34:55.281 --> 34:59.185
responded to his advances
by her own volition.

34:59.285 --> 35:01.827
No, he used her,

35:01.927 --> 35:04.630
and then he made her
suffer for it.

35:04.730 --> 35:07.472
Poor child.

35:07.572 --> 35:10.075
And so what did you
do with the paper?

35:10.175 --> 35:11.956
I took it with me.

35:12.056 --> 35:13.838
Why?

35:13.938 --> 35:15.840
To destroy him,

35:15.940 --> 35:18.843
see him go to prison
where he belonged.

35:18.943 --> 35:19.784
Well, what, did you
tell anyone about it?

35:19.864 --> 35:21.685
You bet I did.

35:21.785 --> 35:23.487
Chief Pratt.

35:23.587 --> 35:26.850
What do you
suggest we do?

35:26.950 --> 35:28.692
Keep it in
your safe for now.

35:28.792 --> 35:29.853
And don't worry,

35:29.953 --> 35:31.695
you'll see how we deal
with guys like that

35:31.795 --> 35:33.656
around here.

35:33.756 --> 35:35.538
Okay.

35:35.638 --> 35:37.540
<i>He said</i>
<i>he would look into it.</i>

35:37.640 --> 35:40.783
And then Nola disappeared,

35:40.883 --> 35:43.585
and he said he would
investigate further...

35:43.685 --> 35:44.626
Okay.

35:44.726 --> 35:46.508
But by that time,

35:46.608 --> 35:48.930
that goddamn paper
had disappeared also.

35:50.612 --> 35:52.834
Yeah, the paper
disappeared?

35:52.934 --> 35:54.876
And how did
that happen?

35:54.976 --> 35:56.157
Who the hell knows?

35:56.257 --> 35:59.000
I kept it in the safe
at Clark's.

35:59.100 --> 36:03.764
I was the only one
with the key.

36:03.864 --> 36:06.406
One day, in early August,

36:06.506 --> 36:09.850
I went to look for it,
and it was gone.

36:09.950 --> 36:13.573
Strange,
don't you think?

36:13.673 --> 36:15.675
Yeah.

36:17.677 --> 36:18.698
Listen, do you, uh,

36:18.798 --> 36:20.739
do you know someone
named Elijah Stern?

36:20.839 --> 36:22.101
Of course.

36:22.201 --> 36:24.743
He funds the gala,

36:24.843 --> 36:27.546
and, like,
a million other things.

36:27.646 --> 36:32.590
He also, uh, he owned
the house at Goose Cove.

36:32.690 --> 36:34.432
He rented it to Harry

36:34.532 --> 36:37.074
before he sold it
to the pervy son of a bitch.

36:37.174 --> 36:40.678
Excuse me, Goose Cove
belonged to Elijah Stern?

36:40.778 --> 36:42.780
Yup.

36:49.386 --> 36:50.607
How well did you know

36:50.707 --> 36:52.709
Elijah Stern?

36:54.390 --> 36:56.392
Hmm...

36:58.674 --> 37:01.537
<i>The first time I met him</i>
<i>was at the gala.</i>

37:01.637 --> 37:03.098
<i>I sat next to him.</i>

37:03.198 --> 37:06.622
<i>Very charming man.</i>

37:06.722 --> 37:07.662
<i>Smart. Eccentric.</i>

37:07.762 --> 37:10.505
<i>Patron of the arts.</i>

37:10.605 --> 37:11.666
That's it?

37:11.766 --> 37:13.948
Um...

37:14.048 --> 37:15.069
he was a nice guy to talk to.

37:15.169 --> 37:16.110
I went to
his house a few times.

37:16.210 --> 37:18.593
Beautiful home.

37:18.693 --> 37:19.994
Why?

37:20.094 --> 37:22.816
Did Nola know him?

37:28.582 --> 37:30.123
I don't think so.

37:30.223 --> 37:32.645
I mean, she might have met him
at the diner, but...

37:32.745 --> 37:33.766
Mm-hm.

37:33.866 --> 37:35.128
No chance
he might have seen her

37:35.228 --> 37:37.229
when she was at Goose Cove
with you?

37:38.310 --> 37:40.953
Well, I don't know.

38:05.175 --> 38:07.177
[rings buzzer]

38:16.025 --> 38:17.687
Can I help you?

38:17.787 --> 38:19.248
Yes, I'm here
to see Mr. Stern.

38:19.348 --> 38:21.050
My name is Marcus Goldman.

38:21.150 --> 38:22.371
Do you have
an appointment?

38:22.471 --> 38:24.012
No. No, I don't.

38:24.112 --> 38:25.934
Mr. Stern doesn't
see visitors

38:26.034 --> 38:27.856
without an appointment.

38:27.956 --> 38:29.858
And how do I make
an appointment?

38:29.958 --> 38:31.960
Mr. Stern makes
the appointments.

38:33.481 --> 38:36.104
That's a bit of
a catch-22 there, isn't it?

38:36.204 --> 38:37.104
Good day, Mr. Goldman.

38:37.204 --> 38:38.706
Just-just tell him

38:38.806 --> 38:41.969
it's about
Nola Kellergan, please?

38:43.210 --> 38:45.212
One moment.

39:08.193 --> 39:10.195
[sighs]

39:20.844 --> 39:22.746
[door opens]

39:22.846 --> 39:25.108
Mr. Goldman?

39:25.208 --> 39:27.210
Mr. Stern will see you.

39:36.499 --> 39:38.501
[knocks gently]

39:40.382 --> 39:44.106
Mr. Goldman, sir.

39:47.349 --> 39:49.651
Thank you for
seeing me, Mr. Stern.

39:49.751 --> 39:53.054
Mr. Goldman,
the writer, correct?

39:53.154 --> 39:54.856
Yes.

39:54.956 --> 39:59.220
To what do I owe the honor
of this unannounced visit?

39:59.320 --> 40:03.063
I'm investigating the
death of Nola Kellergan.

40:03.163 --> 40:05.626
Isn't that what
we have police for?

40:05.726 --> 40:08.788
I'm a friend
of Harry Quebert's.

40:08.888 --> 40:11.951
And what does that
have to do with me?

40:12.051 --> 40:15.435
I understand that you...

40:15.535 --> 40:16.756
Well, the house
that Harry lives in

40:16.856 --> 40:17.637
at Goose Cove

40:17.737 --> 40:19.278
used to belong to you.

40:19.378 --> 40:21.940
I sold it to him
in 1976, yes.

40:23.262 --> 40:24.883
I was just wondering

40:24.983 --> 40:30.168
why someone like yourself
would own a house in Sommerdale.

40:30.268 --> 40:31.770
It's not exactly, uh--

40:31.870 --> 40:34.052
My father built the house.

40:34.152 --> 40:37.815
He wanted something by the ocean
that was close to Augusta.

40:37.915 --> 40:41.979
Sommerdale's
a pretty little town.

40:42.079 --> 40:43.781
So, just, uh,
just to be clear,

40:43.881 --> 40:46.183
when Nola Kellergan disappeared,

40:46.283 --> 40:48.185
you still owned Goose Cove.

40:48.285 --> 40:50.887
I did, yes.

40:52.208 --> 40:55.792
A witness saw her getting
into your chauffeur's car

40:55.892 --> 40:58.414
<i>several times</i>
<i>the summer she disappeared.</i>

41:11.586 --> 41:13.167
My chauffeur,

41:13.267 --> 41:15.289
Luther Caleb,

41:15.389 --> 41:17.371
was a brave and honest man.

41:17.471 --> 41:19.133
A man of talent.

41:19.233 --> 41:20.895
An artist.

41:20.995 --> 41:25.058
I won't have you here
sullying his name

41:25.158 --> 41:28.822
when he's no longer present
to defend himself.

41:28.922 --> 41:31.224
He's dead?

41:31.324 --> 41:33.386
He died
a long time ago.

41:33.486 --> 41:36.269
Was that his art studio
I saw from the front?

41:36.369 --> 41:37.830
Yes.

41:37.930 --> 41:39.031
I kept it
just as it was

41:39.131 --> 41:40.472
out of respect.

41:40.572 --> 41:42.034
And you don't have
any reason to believe

41:42.134 --> 41:44.136
that he was involved
in Nola's disappearance?

41:46.378 --> 41:49.361
You have your killer,
Mr. Goldman.

41:49.461 --> 41:52.043
Mr. Quebert is in prison
awaiting trial, is he not?

41:52.143 --> 41:53.204
Well, I'm not convinced
of his guilt,

41:53.304 --> 41:55.586
which is why I'm here.

41:57.988 --> 42:01.852
Your investigation
must be faltering

42:01.952 --> 42:03.854
if you're coming here
to question my background

42:03.954 --> 42:05.295
and implicate my chauffeur.

42:05.395 --> 42:06.857
[door opens]

42:06.957 --> 42:08.858
This interview is over.

42:08.958 --> 42:11.160
Goodbye, Mr. Goldman.

42:12.442 --> 42:15.104
Thank you for your time.

42:15.204 --> 42:18.587

42:26.014 --> 42:27.075
I'm so sorry.

42:27.175 --> 42:30.318
Would it be possible
to use the facilities?

42:30.418 --> 42:32.280
The guest
bathroom

42:32.380 --> 42:33.401
is through
the sliding door

42:33.501 --> 42:35.002
to the left.

42:35.102 --> 42:37.825
Okay.
Thank you.

42:42.509 --> 42:44.511
[sighs]

43:20.464 --> 43:22.466
Holy shit.

43:37.039 --> 43:39.041
[muttering]

43:44.646 --> 43:47.048
Oh, my god.

43:56.457 --> 43:58.779
[camera app snaps]

44:01.582 --> 44:03.584
[snaps]

44:19.758 --> 44:21.760
[flushes toilet]

44:42.179 --> 44:43.240
Thank you.
