00:18.640 --> 00:20.080
- Stand down!
- Step back or I'll kill her.

00:20.160 --> 00:23.600
- Put your gun down now.
- Step back! I'll kill her!

00:23.680 --> 00:25.400
I will kill her!

00:31.280 --> 00:33.880
When I was inside,
I recognised one of the men.

00:33.960 --> 00:34.680
Who?

00:34.760 --> 00:37.320
I can't place him,
but I know that I saw him before today.

00:37.680 --> 00:40.560
Why did they think you were
holding something back from them?

00:40.640 --> 00:45.120
But I am not going to tell these people things
about my private life they don't need to know.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.680
That you don't "think" they need to know.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.280
Why are you here?

00:49.360 --> 00:52.640
Your mother told Marwan
you took care of the American girl?

00:52.720 --> 00:55.640
- Yeah.
- Then you need help getting rid of the body.

00:55.720 --> 00:57.920
He's going to kill our son.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.280
Yes.

01:03.120 --> 01:04.800
I took care of the girl. Marwan knows.

01:04.879 --> 01:07.560
It's not Marwan who wants you dead.

01:07.640 --> 01:09.120
Who wants me dead?

01:09.680 --> 01:12.000
Your father.

01:12.360 --> 01:16.240
Thank you for helping me out.
They said Maya's arrived.

01:16.320 --> 01:19.120
She's in the exam area.
We're about to do a workup.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.680
" She suffers from schizophrenia.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.600
I want us to be together again.

01:23.680 --> 01:26.160
I'm sorry, Paul.

01:26.240 --> 01:28.600
I'm seeing someone.

01:28.680 --> 01:30.040
Paul, this is Jack Bauer.

01:30.120 --> 01:32.440
Nice to meet you.

01:32.840 --> 01:35.120
What was your courier transporting?

01:35.200 --> 01:37.080
It's a Dobson-type override.

01:37.160 --> 01:39.320
What exactly does this override do?

01:39.400 --> 01:44.120
It can remotely take control
of a nuclear power facility.

01:44.200 --> 01:47.400
A person with this program,
could they do the opposite?

01:47.480 --> 01:49.720
Create a disaster at a plant, a meltdown?

01:49.800 --> 01:50.720
Theoretically.

01:50.800 --> 01:54.440
How many nuclear plants
in this country would be vulnerable?

01:54.520 --> 01:56.040
All of them.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.840
- " Yes?"
- It's me.

01:58.920 --> 02:01.920
They found out about the override.

02:19.080 --> 02:21.320
- Did you get the surveillance footage?
- No.

02:21.400 --> 02:26.200
The Heritage dinner was monitored
by a private company, Felsted Security.

02:26.280 --> 02:29.720
They've got the tapes, but
they're working off a closed system.

02:29.800 --> 02:32.120
I've got to go pick up the tapes for you to ID.

02:32.200 --> 02:36.240
- Where are you on the guestlist?
- I'm having it sent here.

02:36.320 --> 02:41.160
- You know, we're running out of time.
- What do you mean? Is it that urgent?

02:41.240 --> 02:46.000
Yes. It turns out your kidnapping was
just a cover for a much larger attack.

02:46.080 --> 02:51.120
The trial was used to overload the Internet
to divert us from what they were really doing.

02:51.200 --> 02:54.760
- I need a full tactical for my vehicle.
- Which is what?

02:54.840 --> 02:57.760
They're in possession
of a device called an override.

02:57.840 --> 03:01.240
With that they have control
of 104 nuclear plants in this country.

03:01.320 --> 03:03.880
The device maintains heat levels
of the reactors.

03:03.960 --> 03:07.520
Effectively, they can melt down
every one of those plants.

03:07.600 --> 03:09.360
Thank you.

03:09.440 --> 03:12.800
The man you saw when you
were held captive, he's our only lead.

03:12.880 --> 03:16.040
Let me come to Felsted Security for the ID.
It'll be quicker.

03:16.120 --> 03:20.200
I can't. After what you've been through today,
I'm not gonna put you at risk.

03:20.280 --> 03:24.440
Our nation's nuclear plants will melt down
if we don't find that override.

03:24.520 --> 03:27.600
We can't afford to waste any more time.

03:31.520 --> 03:33.280
Come with me.

03:33.600 --> 03:36.240
There are 104 nuclear power stations
in the US.

03:36.320 --> 03:40.680
We've learnt that terrorists are trying
to convert all 104 cores into weapons.

03:40.760 --> 03:43.280
Give us the worst-case casualty scenarios.

03:43.360 --> 03:47.480
This graphic represents a single
meltdown scenario. Edgar, break it down.

03:47.560 --> 03:53.000
The override will stop the coolant system
and the core will melt through containment.

03:53.080 --> 03:57.920
The population within a ten-mile radius
will receive the highest doses of radiation.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.880
Those people will die within two days.

04:00.960 --> 04:05.480
Now, the smallest of these 104 cities
represents 75,000 people.

04:05.560 --> 04:10.880
Multiply that by 104. We're looking at
7.8 million casualties, and that's conservative.

04:10.960 --> 04:13.680
The environmental impact
will be catastrophic.

04:13.760 --> 04:18.360
30 miles in all directions of each plant
will be uninhabitable for at least five years.

04:18.440 --> 04:21.440
Don't plants have security systems
to prevent breaches?

04:21.519 --> 04:24.320
They do, but the override's
already de-activated them.

04:24.400 --> 04:28.840
And if we don't succeed, how long
before these cores start to melt down?

04:28.920 --> 04:33.600
We're projecting the first radiation shock
waves in approximately three hours.

04:33.680 --> 04:38.320
I want comm and logistics to work
on getting a handle on the software.

04:38.400 --> 04:44.080
The rest of you will handle support
along with NRC personnel. Let's get to work.

04:44.160 --> 04:46.800
- Erin, we're leaving now.
- Where are you going?

04:46.880 --> 04:49.160
Audrey's given us a lead
we need to follow up.

04:49.240 --> 04:52.560
- What kind of lead?
- I recognised someone, an American.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.880
I saw him at a function
a couple of months ago.

04:54.960 --> 04:58.480
We're going to view surveillance tapes
at a private security firm.

04:58.560 --> 05:02.240
I don't want her going out now.
Why can't you access the tapes here?

05:02.320 --> 05:04.360
I wish we could, but they're offline.

05:04.440 --> 05:08.440
They'd have to record four hours of material
for us to view. We don't have time.

05:08.520 --> 05:13.680
These people want to use nuclear plants
as weapons. We have to follow this lead now.

05:13.760 --> 05:17.440
Sir, Audrey's the only person
who can make this ID.

05:17.520 --> 05:21.360
If anything happens, Jack,
I will hold you personally responsible.

05:21.440 --> 05:23.840
I understand.

05:26.600 --> 05:29.720
- How far away is this facility?
- Not far, Burbank.

05:29.800 --> 05:32.040
- Audrey.
- Paul.

05:32.120 --> 05:34.240
- I'll get the team set up.
- We need to talk.

05:34.320 --> 05:36.480
- We'll do it when I get back.
- From where?

05:36.560 --> 05:40.080
We're following up on something.
Please, can we do this later?

05:40.160 --> 05:41.760
- How many on your team?
- Four.

05:41.840 --> 05:46.520
Set up a weapons package.
I'll meet you in the motor pool.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.800
I don't know about this, but I know
about you and him, and I am not OK with it.

05:55.880 --> 05:59.280
- You and I aren't together.
- We were trying to work things out.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.960
Yeah, I tried.
But you kept putting it off, so I gave up.

06:03.040 --> 06:06.280
We haven't been together for months.
We're not working it out.

06:06.360 --> 06:08.440
- Sorry to interrupt.
- She is my wife.

06:08.520 --> 06:10.920
Paul, please.

06:13.280 --> 06:15.040
Excuse me.

06:15.120 --> 06:17.200
She's my wife.

06:18.040 --> 06:20.640
Don't you forget that.

06:22.080 --> 06:24.440
Yeah.

06:26.280 --> 06:28.600
Let's go.

06:29.600 --> 06:32.920
- Jack, I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

06:40.760 --> 06:44.480
I just received these files from DOD.
I need to give them to Bauer.

06:44.560 --> 06:48.360
- Oh, you can't. Jack just left.
- Oh. Can I forward them to him?

06:48.440 --> 06:52.240
He went with Audrey to Felsted Security
to look at some archive footage.

06:52.320 --> 06:54.840
OK. I guess I could just
hold onto them for him.

06:54.920 --> 06:57.400
Yeah, that'd be fine.

07:23.160 --> 07:26.240
- Paul.
- Jim. We need to talk.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.840
Come in here.

07:36.960 --> 07:40.120
Do you know about Audrey and Jack Bauer?

07:40.200 --> 07:42.800
Not till an hour ago.

07:42.880 --> 07:45.440
They were carrying on right under your nose.

07:45.520 --> 07:49.720
That's pretty unprofessional,
wouldn't you say?

07:50.840 --> 07:53.400
Look, I understand your feelings about this,

07:53.480 --> 07:57.840
but you and Audrey have been separated
for almost a year. Paul, I'm sorry.

07:57.920 --> 08:02.160
She's a big girl, she can do what she wants.

08:02.240 --> 08:06.520
Well, what she's doing is...
she's breaking my heart.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.440
- Marianne.
- Sarah.

08:29.520 --> 08:34.240
- What do you need back here?
- Edgar asked for a manual reboot of hub five.

08:34.320 --> 08:37.640
- I can do that for him.
- No, no. It's fine.

08:37.720 --> 08:39.679
OK.

08:51.120 --> 08:53.880
- " Yes?"
- Bauer and Audrey left five minutes ago.

08:53.960 --> 08:58.520
- Where'd they go?
- Felsted Security. 357 White Oak Boulevard.

08:58.600 --> 09:02.600
All right. Good. You're going to need
to set things up on your end.

09:02.680 --> 09:05.120
What? I should be done here.

09:05.200 --> 09:08.280
No. When Jack Bauer
and Audrey Raines are killed,

09:08.360 --> 09:13.240
CTU is going to know
that someone inside leaked their location.

09:14.240 --> 09:17.040
- All right. What do I do?
- Divert suspicion.

09:20.760 --> 09:23.240
Fine.

09:27.440 --> 09:30.040
I'm standing live just outside the perimeter.

09:30.120 --> 09:33.080
Unfortunately the Pentagon
is not commenting,

09:33.160 --> 09:39.160
but we do know that at 12:10pm Secretary
Heller and his daughter, Audrey Raines,

09:39.240 --> 09:43.000
were successfully rescued.
The number of fatalities is unknown,

09:43.080 --> 09:47.640
but sources say there might have been
as many as 20 terrorists inside the building,

09:47.720 --> 09:50.040
and there are no survivors among them.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.120
- Yes?
- " Any lost data?"

09:52.200 --> 09:55.080
The critical instructions
uploaded before the assault.

09:55.160 --> 09:57.160
- "Good. Then we're all set?"
- Yes.

09:58.640 --> 10:04.640
- The override has control of the plants.
- What about Behrooz? What about our son?

10:07.760 --> 10:11.280
We have to be strong now.
We'll mourn him when this is over.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.840
- Hello?
- " Mom?"

10:32.920 --> 10:35.920
Behrooz? Are you all right?

10:36.000 --> 10:38.240
Tariq tried to kill me.
He was gonna shoot me.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.920
- I had to defend myself.
- What did you do?

10:41.000 --> 10:44.880
- I killed him. You can't let Father know.
- Why not?

10:44.960 --> 10:49.640
He's the one who told Tariq to do it. He wants
me dead because I messed up with Debbie.

10:49.720 --> 10:54.120
Behrooz, that's not possible.
Your father would never want to hurt you.

10:54.200 --> 10:57.680
It's true. Mom, I don't know what to do.

10:57.760 --> 11:00.120
- You have to help me.
- Where are you now?

11:00.200 --> 11:03.360
I'm near the Metrolink station
on Lassen in Chatsworth.

11:03.440 --> 11:05.640
- Are you using Tariq's car?
- "Yes."

11:05.720 --> 11:08.960
Hide it. I'll pick you up there in a half hour.

11:09.040 --> 11:11.040
Hurry.

11:17.200 --> 11:20.240
- Who was on the phone?
- It was nothing important.

11:20.320 --> 11:22.440
Liar.

11:23.520 --> 11:27.440
- What did Behrooz do?
- What did you do? Did you give the order?

11:27.520 --> 11:32.440
Behrooz was not committed. It was just
a matter of time before he turned against us.

11:32.520 --> 11:35.360
You ordered Tariq to kill him.

11:35.440 --> 11:37.600
To kill our own son.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.920
No, no, no!

11:40.000 --> 11:41.720
You...

11:44.520 --> 11:46.840
- Where's Tariq?
- Behrooz killed him.

11:46.920 --> 11:50.760
- That's impossible.
- Because you think he's weak? He's not.

11:50.840 --> 11:55.920
Nothing, nothing will stand in the way
of what needs to be done.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.320
Not him, not you.

11:59.400 --> 12:04.040
- Where is he now?
- Why? What are you going to do?

12:06.280 --> 12:09.720
- You're hurting me.
- I will do more than that.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.880
Now, you listen to me, woman.

12:11.960 --> 12:17.520
You will do exactly as you told him.
You will pick him up in half an hour.

12:56.600 --> 12:59.400
What did you say to Paul?

13:02.120 --> 13:05.960
That I'm filing for divorce
as soon as I get back to DC.

13:07.480 --> 13:10.280
Are you sure that's what you want?

13:13.800 --> 13:15.800
Yes.

13:21.920 --> 13:23.920
OK.

13:34.600 --> 13:36.880
Do you have something?

13:36.960 --> 13:42.360
It seems the override hasn't completely taken
control. I'm starting to get some response.

13:42.440 --> 13:44.680
- What can I do?
- Stay off hub five, I need it.

13:44.760 --> 13:47.600
- I thought hub five was out for a reboot?
- No.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.800
Curtis, come here.

13:52.520 --> 13:55.760
- Could I talk to you for a minute?
- Actually, I'm kind of busy.

13:55.840 --> 13:59.040
You lied to me
about doing a reboot for Edgar.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.080
- Yes, I did.
- Why?

14:04.040 --> 14:07.960
I made a personal call and I knew
it was inappropriate during the crisis.

14:08.040 --> 14:11.000
- I didn't want anybody to know.
- Why'd you do it in here?

14:11.080 --> 14:13.320
Why didn't you just go outside?

14:14.240 --> 14:18.280
I was trying to make it look
like I was working. OK?

14:18.360 --> 14:21.640
Look, I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

14:37.560 --> 14:39.600
It's Marwan.

14:42.800 --> 14:45.680
- Yes?
- Has Tariq taken care of your son?

14:45.760 --> 14:49.560
I haven't spoken with Tariq, but
if there was a problem he would've called.

14:49.640 --> 14:52.720
The fact I'm even talking to you
about this is a problem.

14:52.800 --> 14:55.560
The next two hours are crucial.
I can't be distracted.

14:55.640 --> 15:01.000
I understand. I will personally oversee
the situation to make sure it's resolved.

15:01.080 --> 15:03.800
- Fix this, Navi.
- Of course.

15:10.280 --> 15:14.200
What is Marwan going to say
if he finds out Behrooz killed Tariq?

15:14.280 --> 15:17.760
Tariq is expendable, like we all are.

15:17.840 --> 15:20.000
Marwan understands that.

15:20.960 --> 15:24.720
All he cares about is that Behrooz is silenced.

15:26.280 --> 15:32.640
I will not be able to look at you after today
without thinking about what we did to him.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.240
- I think I got it.
- What?

15:50.320 --> 15:53.880
- The override. I got a piece of the code.
- What does that mean?

15:53.960 --> 15:55.960
I can turn off the override,

15:56.040 --> 15:58.360
- stop some of the meltdown.
- What do you need?

15:58.440 --> 16:01.800
To get into the kernel, but the NRC
won't let me. It's too dangerous.

16:01.880 --> 16:05.280
- Why?
- If I screw up, I could start a chain reaction.

16:05.360 --> 16:09.480
All right. I need you to present this to Heller.
He can order NRC to let you in.

16:09.560 --> 16:12.280
- Heller?
- He's in the situation room. Why?

16:12.360 --> 16:13.960
- I shouldn't.
- Why not?

16:14.040 --> 16:17.720
- I could faint. I have low blood sugar.
- It's just Driscoll and Heller.

16:17.800 --> 16:21.400
- Driscoll's in there too?
- You'll be fine.

16:24.120 --> 16:26.440
Excuse me. I'm gonna have to interrupt.

16:26.520 --> 16:28.840
- What is it?
- This is Edgar Stiles.

16:28.920 --> 16:31.920
He's requesting access
to the kernels of the power plants.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.680
My understanding is that no one
is to manipulate those kernels

16:35.760 --> 16:38.040
while the plants are online.

16:38.120 --> 16:40.240
There is a way to do it if you're careful.

16:40.320 --> 16:44.880
I'd stay away from the precompiled headers
while putting a lock on the override code.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.120
The chances of a load imbalance...

16:47.200 --> 16:52.200
I don't understand what you're talking about.
Just tell me what the downside is

16:52.280 --> 16:56.120
if the kernels are disrupted
because of your manipulation.

16:56.200 --> 17:02.320
If I make a mistake, I can accelerate
a core meltdown in some of the reactors.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.839
This is a bad idea.
Maybe we shouldn't do it.

17:04.920 --> 17:09.000
- If you're successful, you can regain control?
- Yes.

17:09.079 --> 17:14.680
Edgar, what we need to know
is can you do this without making a mistake?

17:18.520 --> 17:22.960
- Yeah, I can do it.
- You're not filling me with confidence, Edgar.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.920
Look,

17:25.000 --> 17:29.560
I'm just a little nervous,
but if I say I can do it, I can do it.

17:35.960 --> 17:39.560
- He'll run away the moment he sees you.
- He won't see me.

17:39.640 --> 17:42.800
You'll be the only one in the car
when you pick him up.

17:45.560 --> 17:48.840
- It's Behrooz.
- Answer it.

17:51.160 --> 17:53.160
- Hello?
- Are you almost here?

17:53.240 --> 17:55.800
Yes.

17:55.880 --> 18:00.440
- What did you tell Dad?
- I didn't, I just left. He was busy working.

18:00.880 --> 18:04.320
What are we going to do?
Wherever we go, he'll find us.

18:04.400 --> 18:07.200
No, he won't. I know a safe place.

18:09.680 --> 18:15.520
I didn't understand until today
what it would feel like doing these things.

18:15.600 --> 18:19.640
They're wrong, Mom. And I see it now.

18:19.720 --> 18:24.320
Don't think about that any more.
You'll be safe now.

18:24.400 --> 18:27.200
But I am thinking about it.

18:27.280 --> 18:30.080
I should go to the police
and tell them everything.

18:30.160 --> 18:32.200
We'll talk about it when I get there.

18:33.360 --> 18:35.360
OK.

18:45.640 --> 18:47.920
You did well.

19:19.760 --> 19:22.560
- Who are they?
- Don't worry about it.

19:22.640 --> 19:24.880
Take the second exit at Angeles Crest.

19:24.960 --> 19:28.280
- He's going to ask me why I'm stopping.
- Let him ask.

19:28.360 --> 19:31.080
- What do I tell him?
- Don't tell him anything.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.720
We'll meet you there.

20:02.360 --> 20:05.720
- Erin. We're making good progress.
- Tell me.

20:05.800 --> 20:09.800
- We've taken 87 plants offline. They're safe.
- What about the other 17?

20:09.880 --> 20:11.960
The terrorists blocked a shutdown.

20:12.040 --> 20:15.360
- Everything we're trying is repelled.
- How do we get around it?

20:15.440 --> 20:20.000
Believe me, Erin, we're trying everything.
If there's a way, we'll find it.

20:20.080 --> 20:22.200
I'll keep you posted.

20:29.680 --> 20:32.400
- Sweetheart?
- Mom.

20:32.480 --> 20:37.000
- How are you feeling?
- Not good. I want Dr Arnowitz.

20:37.080 --> 20:40.360
- You can't see him today.
- Why not?

20:40.440 --> 20:43.080
Because I can't leave, but I want you close by.

20:43.160 --> 20:46.000
Then stay here with me.

20:47.960 --> 20:50.880
I'll be back in a few minutes, I promise.

20:50.960 --> 20:54.880
But you have to do something for me, OK?
I need you to do something.

20:54.960 --> 20:56.960
Maya, look at me.

20:58.400 --> 21:01.520
You need to cooperate with the doctors.

21:02.360 --> 21:05.120
- OK?
- OK.

21:08.440 --> 21:10.880
OK.

21:10.960 --> 21:12.960
Come on.

21:14.600 --> 21:16.680
I'll be back.

21:16.760 --> 21:19.000
I promise.

21:27.200 --> 21:30.000
Take these, please.

21:34.640 --> 21:37.400
Your son underwent SDT
for two and a half hours.

21:37.480 --> 21:39.960
- What'd he say when you took him off it?
- Nothing.

21:40.040 --> 21:44.560
You tortured my son for almost three hours
and ended up yielding nothing?

21:44.640 --> 21:46.840
You gave the order, sir.

21:57.200 --> 22:00.200
- "Give us a moment, please."
- "Yes, sir."

22:04.840 --> 22:10.280
I'm sorry this had to happen, but we had to
make sure you weren't withholding anything.

22:11.360 --> 22:13.360
I hate you.

22:13.440 --> 22:16.480
I never want to see you again.

22:18.920 --> 22:24.560
Please understand that I am responsible
for the lives of millions of people.

22:25.560 --> 22:29.360
You torture me
and now you want me to forgive you?

22:31.680 --> 22:35.520
It just confirms everything
I always knew about you.

22:38.120 --> 22:40.320
Am I free to leave?

22:41.320 --> 22:43.440
Yes.

23:05.560 --> 23:08.600
- Yeah, Paul?
- "Audrey, do you have a minute?"

23:08.680 --> 23:10.200
Sure.

23:10.280 --> 23:14.720
Your dad said something that I've been
thinking about. He said you were a big girl.

23:14.800 --> 23:18.840
- I think I've been treating you like a child.
- I don't think that, Paul.

23:18.920 --> 23:22.280
Whether it comes off that way or not,
I need to respect your choices,

23:22.360 --> 23:25.680
respect who you are, and...

23:26.560 --> 23:28.400
I've been so stupid about all of this.

23:29.320 --> 23:32.920
I've lost sight of the things I love about you.

23:33.920 --> 23:35.480
Look...

23:35.560 --> 23:40.320
I hear what you're saying, but I...
I don't really know how to respond to that.

23:40.400 --> 23:42.960
You don't have to.
I just want you to know that...

23:43.040 --> 23:46.120
I've been wrong about a lot of things.

23:46.200 --> 23:49.720
Before you make any big decisions,
that you're entitled to make,

23:50.600 --> 23:52.280
let some time go by.

23:52.360 --> 23:56.080
Is that fair?
Is that fair of me to ask?

23:56.160 --> 23:58.360
Yeah, yeah, that's fair.

23:59.400 --> 24:03.000
OK, well, I'll... I'll see you later.

24:03.080 --> 24:05.120
Yeah, see you later.

24:10.520 --> 24:13.520
- How far out are we?
- " A few miles away, sir.

24:13.600 --> 24:15.600
OK.

24:42.040 --> 24:44.600
- Where are we gonna go?
- Out of the city.

24:44.680 --> 24:47.120
Why did Father want to kill me? I'm his son!

24:47.200 --> 24:52.000
Stop, Behrooz, you can't
think about that now. Get in, get in.

24:56.240 --> 24:59.000
We killed two people today.

24:59.080 --> 25:03.040
- I can't do this. I'm freaking out.
- Sh.

25:06.400 --> 25:09.080
Get on the train.

25:09.160 --> 25:12.360
- What?
- Your father's following us.

25:12.440 --> 25:14.960
- What?
- It was the only way I could save you.

25:15.040 --> 25:17.200
Now! Dammit, Behrooz, get out! Go!

25:19.520 --> 25:21.120
Go!

25:21.200 --> 25:23.480
- Obey me! "
- Mom!

25:32.040 --> 25:33.840
Go!

26:48.160 --> 26:52.080
... the secretary's rescue.
Mark Scortino is standing by.

26:52.160 --> 26:54.640
Mark, what's going on down there?

26:54.720 --> 26:58.920
- Is it taken care of?
- No. There's a problem.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.080
My wife and Behrooz have betrayed us.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.400
- Where are they now?
- I don't know.

27:18.480 --> 27:21.360
But Dina's wounded.
She'll need medical attention.

27:21.440 --> 27:25.320
So you come to me,
asking me for help with this mess?

27:26.320 --> 27:29.720
I can't do it alone, Marwan. "

27:30.720 --> 27:32.880
I'm ashamed of myself.

27:32.960 --> 27:35.680
Allow me to make this right.

27:35.760 --> 27:39.040
- What would you need?
- To monitor the local hospitals.

27:39.520 --> 27:44.240
I'll also need drivers,
as well as access to police frequencies.

27:44.320 --> 27:47.600
- You think she'll go to the police?
- No. No.

27:47.680 --> 27:52.280
But they may pick her up
if they find out she's been shot.

27:58.640 --> 28:03.840
I told you.
I can't be distracted by this right now.

28:07.840 --> 28:12.760
Give him what he needs. Make sure Dina and
the child are captured before they do us harm.

28:12.840 --> 28:14.920
Thank you. Thank you.

28:18.680 --> 28:22.920
No matter what happens today,
you will answer for this.

28:25.880 --> 28:28.560
I understand.

28:39.120 --> 28:41.560
- " Has she seen the tapes?"
- No.

28:41.640 --> 28:45.720
- "I'll put the guestlist together."
- How long will it take to create the database?

28:45.800 --> 28:48.520
Not long.
Once you identify him, we'll run it through.

28:48.600 --> 28:49.800
OK.

28:49.880 --> 28:54.120
- "I'll let you know the second it's done."
- OK, Marcy. Thanks.

28:54.200 --> 28:57.200
We have a copy of the guestlist
from the dinner.

28:57.280 --> 29:00.840
Once you make an ID, we'll send it
through a database, find out who it is.

29:00.920 --> 29:02.680
- OK.
- I'm carrying.

29:02.760 --> 29:05.240
Yeah?

29:05.320 --> 29:08.080
- This is Marianne Taylor at CTU.
- "What is it?"

29:08.160 --> 29:12.080
Curtis says that as soon as
Audrey recognises someone from the video,

29:12.160 --> 29:14.720
he wants it sent to my system.
I'm on 60 Casper.

29:14.800 --> 29:16.800
Why didn't he tell me himself?

29:16.880 --> 29:20.520
They're trying to shut down
the remaining plants. Everybody's on that.

29:20.600 --> 29:23.400
Are they gonna be able
to control them in time?

29:23.480 --> 29:26.840
- I don't know.
- OK, keep me informed.

29:26.920 --> 29:30.480
- What is it?
- We don't have a lot of time.

29:31.040 --> 29:36.120
- She's doing better now she's sleeping.
- That's very good news.

29:42.920 --> 29:44.920
- Did you give her Haldol?
- Mm-hm. Why?

29:45.000 --> 29:47.360
She's allergic to it. It's in her file.

29:47.440 --> 29:49.680
- The date is old, it's the wrong file.
- Maya!

29:49.760 --> 29:51.680
Maya!

29:51.760 --> 29:53.640
She's unconscious.

29:53.720 --> 29:56.800
Mary, we have a code.
I need 25ccs of norepinephrine.

29:56.880 --> 29:59.560
" How could you
have got the wrong file?

30:00.240 --> 30:02.320
Excuse me, please step back.

30:02.400 --> 30:05.040
I need that syringe now.

30:07.480 --> 30:11.080
- Doctor, 25ccs.
- Ms Driscoll, Secretary Heller...

30:11.160 --> 30:14.240
- Let's go, Mary.
- Mary, make sure I get a crash cart...

30:14.320 --> 30:16.520
What is it, Sarah?

30:16.600 --> 30:18.320
Sarah?

30:18.400 --> 30:21.320
- Secretary Heller needs you.
- For what?

30:21.400 --> 30:27.000
He's going online with the president and
wants to know our progress on the reactors.

30:27.080 --> 30:33.800
Tell him Edgar's still trying to get control of
the kernel and we'll know more in 15 minutes.

30:33.880 --> 30:38.360
If we do stop the meltdown, he wants to know
if there'll be any system contamination.

30:38.440 --> 30:42.920
No, there won't be any contamination.
It'll take 36 hours to reboot the reactors.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.920
- " Is there anything else?
- No, that's all.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
All right, go.

30:55.440 --> 30:58.360
We had security cameras
running on only two areas.

30:58.440 --> 31:01.280
One covering the main ballroom,
one at the entrance.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.520
OK. Put them both on.

31:10.200 --> 31:13.960
Ballroom angle's too wide.
Let's just go with the entrance.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.160
- " What time is that?
- 6:39.

31:16.240 --> 31:20.600
That's too early.
I met him when I arrived, around 9, 9:15.

31:20.680 --> 31:23.280
All right.

31:34.160 --> 31:37.040
Wait, stop.

31:38.040 --> 31:41.440
- Can you back this up a few frames?
- Sure.

31:45.520 --> 31:48.720
Wait, wait. Stop. There.

31:49.160 --> 31:51.320
I think that's him.

31:52.360 --> 31:56.000
- Can you enhance him right here?
- Yeah.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.480
That image won't process. We need it clearer.

31:58.560 --> 32:01.360
Let me see if I can get that for you.

32:07.600 --> 32:10.120
Who's supposed to be at that desk?

32:10.200 --> 32:14.280
Oh, that's Mitchell.
Probably went out for another smoke.

32:15.680 --> 32:18.040
That gate's open. No one's there.
Do you copy?

32:18.120 --> 32:20.680
Craig?

32:22.280 --> 32:24.360
Rick?

32:24.440 --> 32:26.440
- How many ways into this area?
- Two.

32:26.520 --> 32:29.600
Put 'em up. Rick!

32:32.800 --> 32:35.080
Get down!

32:36.960 --> 32:39.200
- You OK?
- Yeah.

32:39.280 --> 32:41.800
Dammit.

32:44.960 --> 32:49.160
I'm gonna call for help, but I need to know
where the tape is. Where's the source?

32:49.240 --> 32:52.960
The... main... server.

32:53.040 --> 32:54.960
How do I access it?

32:55.040 --> 32:59.040
- On the... flash memory.
- OK.

32:59.120 --> 33:02.000
Watch the security monitors.

33:05.320 --> 33:07.960
Do you have Sticks?

33:09.160 --> 33:13.360
- Gary, do you have Sticks?
- In my... p-pocket.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.640
OK.

33:25.720 --> 33:28.000
Stay with me.

33:30.320 --> 33:33.320
- He's gone.
- Jack, they're coming!

33:34.680 --> 33:37.120
- They're sealing us off.
- Should we call CTU?

33:37.200 --> 33:41.040
No. CTU's been compromised. That's
the only way they'd know we were here.

33:41.120 --> 33:43.120
We gotta get out of here.

33:43.680 --> 33:46.120
Move. Go, go!

33:58.840 --> 34:00.680
Go.

34:03.960 --> 34:06.040
" Come on.

34:12.159 --> 34:14.360
Go, go.

34:29.560 --> 34:32.040
- There's one in the pipe. Safety's off.
- Jack.

34:32.120 --> 34:35.239
You can do this. We'll cover each other.

34:37.199 --> 34:40.760
- I thought CTU had been compromised?
- It has been.

34:41.760 --> 34:44.520
Then who are you calling?

34:45.960 --> 34:49.159
The only person I can trust right now.

35:05.560 --> 35:08.880
And if there are 17 nuclear power plants
about to melt down,

35:08.960 --> 35:12.200
I need to update an evacuation strategy.

35:12.280 --> 35:15.720
I agree. I've laid the groundwork
with the National Guard.

35:15.800 --> 35:22.280
They will go into individual communities
and effect evacuation upon your command.

35:22.360 --> 35:25.600
A worst-case scenario
gives us approximately three hours?

35:25.680 --> 35:28.040
That's correct, sir.

35:28.120 --> 35:31.480
Erin, what are our chances
of shutting down the remaining 17?

35:31.560 --> 35:34.840
At this time, I would say
it's less than 50 per cent.

35:34.920 --> 35:37.800
But we're trying something
to improve those chances.

35:37.880 --> 35:40.000
- "When will you know more?"
- 15 minutes.

35:40.080 --> 35:42.520
- "Keep me updated."
- Yes, Mr President.

35:42.600 --> 35:45.800
Let's find out if Jack and Audrey
have come up with anything.

35:45.880 --> 35:47.880
Yes, sir.

35:54.160 --> 35:57.880
Mr Secretary. I can have a room
prepared for you to rest, if you'd like.

35:57.960 --> 36:00.600
You've been under a great deal of strain.

36:00.680 --> 36:03.880
No, I don't think I can rest.
But thanks anyway.

36:05.520 --> 36:08.120
- Erin.
- Yes, sir?

36:10.040 --> 36:13.160
I understand your daughter's
down in the clinic.

36:13.240 --> 36:17.040
- Yes, but it won't interfere with my work.
- I'm sure it won't.

36:17.120 --> 36:20.120
I was just wondering if everything was OK.

36:22.560 --> 36:25.240
It's something we've lived with
since she was six.

36:25.320 --> 36:28.080
There are good days and bad days.

36:28.160 --> 36:30.160
Today's a bad one.

36:30.240 --> 36:32.760
I'm sorry.

36:39.800 --> 36:42.520
We gotta go right.

36:51.400 --> 36:53.600
OK, come on.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.760
" We're clear.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.680
Move. Move!

37:18.440 --> 37:21.880
" I don't think there's anybody here.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.560
We'll get through this,
but you gotta listen to me.

37:39.640 --> 37:42.440
I need to get that guy's weapon,
I need you to cover me.

37:42.520 --> 37:46.280
Save your ammunition.
Space out your shots. You ready? OK.

37:59.680 --> 38:01.520
Dammit!

38:03.320 --> 38:05.000
- Audrey, get down!
- I'm out!

38:05.080 --> 38:07.200
Stay down!

38:10.480 --> 38:12.480
- I'm empty. I'm empty!
- What?

38:28.680 --> 38:31.000
- Jack!
- Tony!

38:31.080 --> 38:34.680
- You OK?
- Yeah, we're all right! Move. Move!

38:52.680 --> 38:55.240
- Edgar's on the final sequence.
- Is he in the kernel?

38:55.320 --> 39:01.440
Yes. He can't make a mistake or it'll accelerate
the meltdowns instead of stopping them.

39:03.880 --> 39:08.720
Sarah, look up the op-code
for the load A register conditional.

39:08.800 --> 39:11.840
- FF09.
- No, that's ajump A. I need a load A.

39:11.920 --> 39:14.080
Dammit. Move.

39:16.760 --> 39:20.760
- That's it. ABA1. I think I got it.
- What do you mean you "think"?

39:20.840 --> 39:24.000
- I'd like to go through it again.
- How long will that take?

39:24.080 --> 39:26.200
- Ten minutes?
- We don't have time.

39:26.280 --> 39:29.800
- Let me just check the headers.
- Now, Edgar.

39:44.040 --> 39:46.480
I did the best I could, sir. I hope it works.

39:46.560 --> 39:48.560
So do I.

40:06.200 --> 40:08.720
There's no response.

40:09.720 --> 40:12.040
Come on.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.720
There they go.

40:37.520 --> 40:40.920
- Congratulations, Edgar.
- Thank you, sir.

40:53.880 --> 40:57.360
- No, don't tell me that.
- " Edgar, what's going on?

40:58.640 --> 41:02.280
Why are some of the reactors
still not shutting down?

41:05.640 --> 41:08.120
Edgar, talk to me.

41:10.360 --> 41:13.240
Six of the reactors
are immune to the kill sequence.

41:13.320 --> 41:17.360
- The override's taken over their system.
- Those six are going to melt down?

41:17.440 --> 41:20.280
The shutdown codes
have been completely corrupted.

41:20.360 --> 41:25.520
Contact Bauer. Either he finds the people
responsible for planting the override,

41:26.240 --> 41:29.240
or we're looking at a nuclear holocaust.
