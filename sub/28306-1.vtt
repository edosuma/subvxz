WEBVTT

00:07.137 --> 00:10.967
ANNOUNCER: Fosse/Verdon.
All new, Tuesdays at 10:00
on FX.

00:12.229 --> 00:15.319
ANNOUNCER: FX presents
What We Do in the Shadows.

00:21.934 --> 00:23.719
It's nightfall.

00:26.330 --> 00:28.463
The job of a vampire's familiar

00:28.506 --> 00:30.465
is not an easy one.

00:30.508 --> 00:31.901
It's very dangerous.

00:31.944 --> 00:34.164
I mean, they are vampires,
after all.

00:34.208 --> 00:36.514
We can go in now.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.305
Good evening, Master.

00:44.348 --> 00:46.220
MAN :
Guillermo?

00:46.263 --> 00:47.656
Yes, sir?

00:47.699 --> 00:49.745
-Is that you?
-Yes, Master.

00:49.788 --> 00:51.573
-Okay.
-Okay, Master.

00:51.616 --> 00:54.141
It's time to... rise.

00:54.184 --> 00:56.230
MAN:
The... Okay.

01:00.234 --> 01:02.149
MAN:
Guillermo, it is stuck.

01:02.192 --> 01:03.715
I think it is the latch.

01:03.759 --> 01:05.326
GUILLERMO:
Being a vampire's familiar

01:05.369 --> 01:07.763
is like being a best friend.

01:07.806 --> 01:10.113
Who-Who's also a slave.

01:10.157 --> 01:12.115
-MAN: Guillermo, it's too loud.-What?

01:12.159 --> 01:13.464
GUILLERMO:
Tomorrow night marks

01:13.508 --> 01:15.771
the ten-year anniversary since

01:15.814 --> 01:17.120
I started working
for my Master.

01:17.164 --> 01:20.950
I think he's planning
something pretty special.

01:20.993 --> 01:24.040
: I think he's gonna
make me a vampire.

01:25.563 --> 01:27.304
MAN:
This is very embarrassing.

01:27.348 --> 01:29.698
Okay, Master.

01:29.741 --> 01:31.700
He awakens.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.495
Very cool, Master.

01:44.539 --> 01:45.714
Very scary.

01:45.757 --> 01:46.932
Thank you.

NANDOR:
Everyone?

02:26.494 --> 02:28.409
Nadja, Laszlo.

02:28.452 --> 02:30.324
-Yeah?
-Yes?
-Can you come downstairs

02:30.367 --> 02:32.195
for a second, please?

02:32.239 --> 02:34.458
Thank you, Laszlo.

02:34.502 --> 02:36.547
In your own time, Nadja.

02:36.591 --> 02:38.114
Yes, good, excellent.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.246
So, listen.

02:39.289 --> 02:41.422
We have received a letter

02:41.465 --> 02:44.251
and I would like very much
to read it to you.

02:44.294 --> 02:47.341
-But not here, we want to go
into the library.
-Why not here?

02:47.384 --> 02:49.343
I'd like to read it in there.
It's just a formality.

02:49.386 --> 02:50.431
It'll sound
exactly the same if you

02:50.474 --> 02:52.259
read it here than if
you read it in there.

02:52.302 --> 02:54.304
I'm not going to disagree with
you, but that's not the point.

02:54.348 --> 02:55.392
NANDOR:  I was a very ferocious soldier

02:55.436 --> 02:57.133
in the Ottoman Empire.

02:57.177 --> 03:01.006
Which meant a lot of killing,
lot of pillaging.

03:01.050 --> 03:04.706
People would say,
"Please, don't pillage me."

03:04.749 --> 03:06.447
And I would say, "No.

03:06.490 --> 03:10.233
I'm pillaging everyone,
you included."

03:10.277 --> 03:12.148
I was relentless.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.237
They would call me Nandor

03:14.281 --> 03:16.892
the Relentless.

03:16.935 --> 03:19.677
Because I just never relent.

03:19.721 --> 03:20.939
So I'd like very much for us
to go into there, please.

03:20.983 --> 03:22.245
Just a formality.

03:22.289 --> 03:24.160
Come on, please,
it's just a formality.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.683
-You could have read it by now.-Hmm.

03:25.727 --> 03:27.294
Just a formality, okay?
Look, it's not even that far.

03:27.337 --> 03:28.904
-Oh, fuck this, fine.
-Thank you, Laszlo.

03:28.947 --> 03:30.384
It's just a formality,
please, Nadja.

03:30.427 --> 03:33.300
-Just a formality, thank you.

03:33.343 --> 03:35.476
Guillermo, the door.

03:35.519 --> 03:37.260
-That wasn't so bad, was it?

03:37.304 --> 03:41.482
Now before we go into
the reading of the letter,

03:41.525 --> 03:44.354
I wanted to talk about
general hygiene in the cell.

03:44.398 --> 03:45.747
-Last night,

03:45.790 --> 03:47.618
there were all these people
down there,

03:47.662 --> 03:50.317
shouting and screaming,
half-drunk.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.275
Where did they find the alcohol?

03:52.319 --> 03:55.191
No, they were half-drunk.
They'd been half drunk.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.193
-Oh.
-Please, finish a whole victim

03:57.237 --> 03:59.413
before moving on
to a next one, okay?

03:59.456 --> 04:01.284
It's very unhygienic.

04:01.328 --> 04:03.286
I think I know who's leaving
them down there,

04:03.330 --> 04:05.288
-but I don't want to say.-If you've got something to say,

04:05.332 --> 04:07.943
-then damn well say it.
-It's not hygienic.

04:07.986 --> 04:09.858
How dare you.

04:14.906 --> 04:17.344
The problems with living
with other vampires

04:17.387 --> 04:19.128
are the vampires
I have chosen to stay with.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.305
Nandor is like

04:22.349 --> 04:24.568
a big turkey
just walking around

04:24.612 --> 04:26.483
trying to control everything
on the farm.

04:26.527 --> 04:28.093
-Hyah!

04:28.137 --> 04:30.139
NADJA:
And Laszlo is my big, crazy,

04:30.182 --> 04:32.663
wild bear and we love to chase
each other around the house.

04:32.707 --> 04:35.013
-I ought to fucking kill you!

04:35.057 --> 04:37.799
We have a great time together.

04:39.453 --> 04:41.368
LASZLO:
I was the most handsome man

04:41.411 --> 04:42.325
in our village.

04:42.369 --> 04:44.240
His village
was very badly affected

04:44.284 --> 04:46.329
by leprosy and the plague.

04:46.373 --> 04:47.548
That's true.

04:47.591 --> 04:50.333
And I, myself,
did contract leprosy,

04:50.377 --> 04:52.553
but I was quite lucky
'cause it couldn't be seen.

04:52.596 --> 04:54.511
It was only one part
of my anatomy.

04:54.555 --> 04:56.165
Well, I can see it.

04:56.208 --> 04:58.428
Anyway, one night,

04:58.472 --> 05:00.822
I was awoken by this...

05:00.865 --> 05:03.477
horrible clawing at the window.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.043
And I thought,
"Who the hell is that?

05:05.087 --> 05:06.828
'Cause I live
on the third floor."

05:06.871 --> 05:10.179
So I went to investigate it,
I threw back the curtain...

05:10.222 --> 05:13.748
Well, I saw the most beautiful
woman I had ever seen.

05:13.791 --> 05:16.359
But she was gripping the window

05:16.403 --> 05:18.361
and she was clawing
at the glass.

05:18.405 --> 05:19.710
I was hypnotized.

05:19.754 --> 05:21.582
I used hypnosis on him.

05:21.625 --> 05:23.366
Which I found out later.

05:23.410 --> 05:25.586
Anyway,
obviously I invited her in.

05:25.629 --> 05:27.544
We were about to make love

05:27.588 --> 05:30.504
when she turned into this
hideous, leathery bat thing.

05:30.547 --> 05:33.376
She drained me of my blood,

05:33.420 --> 05:35.987
giving me the curse
of eternal life

05:36.031 --> 05:38.076
and thus making me
a bloodthirsty

05:38.120 --> 05:39.469
creature of the night.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.739
Why don't we just
write on them with marker pen?

05:48.783 --> 05:50.611
Put our names and the date?

05:50.654 --> 05:51.612
LASZLO:
Oh, that's a good suggestion.

05:51.655 --> 05:53.048
-NADJA: Yeah.
-Good idea, Nadja.

05:53.091 --> 05:54.658
Marker pens, Guillermo.

05:54.702 --> 05:56.312
Make sure they're permanent.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.574
-Sharpie.
-LASZLO: Genius.

05:57.618 --> 06:00.882
-NADJA: With date, as well.
-Yes, great thinking, Nadja.

06:00.925 --> 06:03.232
-And yes, this... yes.
-The name of the month,
day, year.

06:04.276 --> 06:05.408
Okay.

06:05.452 --> 06:07.671
And now we come...

06:07.715 --> 06:09.456
to the reading... of the letter.

06:09.499 --> 06:11.458
-At last.

06:11.501 --> 06:12.807
Guillermo? Close the door.

06:12.850 --> 06:15.940
-The door's closed, Master.
-Close it more.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.075
More.

06:20.118 --> 06:21.468
Good.

06:21.511 --> 06:23.426
-Now that we are
gathered here...

06:23.470 --> 06:25.428
together as one, finally,

06:25.472 --> 06:26.995
in accordance with
the protocols...

06:27.038 --> 06:28.300
Which you made up.

06:28.344 --> 06:30.346
Yes.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.827
We have received this letter.

06:32.870 --> 06:36.396
From Baron... Afanas.

06:40.704 --> 06:41.618
Really?

06:41.662 --> 06:44.316
Yes.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.666
NANDOR:
How do you...

06:45.709 --> 06:48.103
-GUILLERMO: Like that.
-Shh.

06:48.146 --> 06:49.583
The Baron...

06:52.150 --> 06:53.891
...is coming to visit us.

06:53.935 --> 06:55.719
Holy shit.

06:55.763 --> 06:56.938
Silence, Guillermo.

06:56.981 --> 06:58.461
Vampire comments only.

06:58.505 --> 07:00.028
The Baron never leaves
the old country.

07:00.071 --> 07:02.639
Has he told us what the purposeof his visit is?

07:04.728 --> 07:06.034
Uh...

07:06.077 --> 07:07.688
No.

07:07.731 --> 07:09.298
LASZLO:
The Baron is a firm believer

07:09.341 --> 07:11.300
that vampires should rule
the world.

07:11.343 --> 07:13.911
I think the main purpose
for the Baron's visit

07:13.955 --> 07:16.305
is to find out whether
we as vampires

07:16.348 --> 07:17.611
have populated America.

07:17.654 --> 07:19.743
But as you can see,

07:19.787 --> 07:21.745
the place is fucking massive.

07:21.789 --> 07:23.617
When is he coming, exactly?

07:23.660 --> 07:25.575
-Tomorrow.
-Shit.

07:25.619 --> 07:26.750
NANDOR:
Why didn't you give this
to me earlier?

07:26.794 --> 07:28.491
It arrived this morning, Master.

07:29.884 --> 07:30.972
NADJA:
Baron Afanas is...

07:31.015 --> 07:34.758
a very charming member
of the vampire royalty.

07:34.802 --> 07:36.368
A few hundred years ago,

07:36.412 --> 07:39.371
we enjoyed a very intense,
very long sexual affair.

07:39.415 --> 07:40.503
It was pretty wild.

07:40.547 --> 07:42.592
Lots of acrobatic stuff.

07:42.636 --> 07:43.941
This could make it awkward,

07:43.985 --> 07:46.901
to see him with Laszlo...

07:46.944 --> 07:48.729
present.

07:48.772 --> 07:50.774
LASZLO:
Just between you and I,

07:50.818 --> 07:52.776
a while back, the Baron and I

07:52.820 --> 07:55.431
enjoyed a very intense
sex affair.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.651
Very animalistic.

07:57.694 --> 07:59.304
Acrobatic stuff, you might say.

07:59.348 --> 08:00.567
So I, personally,

08:00.610 --> 08:04.005
am very much looking forward
to reconnecting.

08:04.048 --> 08:06.398
We should get a chariot led by

08:06.442 --> 08:08.923
12 black alligators.

08:08.966 --> 08:10.881
-I like that.
-That's a lot of alligators,

08:10.925 --> 08:11.969
a lot of paint.

08:12.013 --> 08:13.580
What about a van?

08:13.623 --> 08:15.669
A van?

08:15.712 --> 08:16.583
That's not the same, is it?

08:16.626 --> 08:18.323
Can you at least make sure
it's black?

08:18.367 --> 08:21.370
Yeah. Black van for tomorrow?

08:21.413 --> 08:24.678
Excellent. Uh, what about
the Baron's bloodlust?

08:24.721 --> 08:26.549
-Virgins.
-Oh, yes, let's do that.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.551
Guillermo, two virgins
by tomorrow evening.

08:28.595 --> 08:30.597
-Yes, when the Baron arrives

08:30.640 --> 08:32.599
we shall feast on virgin blood.

08:39.606 --> 08:42.260
Vampire only laughing.

08:42.304 --> 08:43.784
-Should we tell Colin Robinson?-Laszlo,

08:43.827 --> 08:45.699
-that is a terrible idea.

08:45.742 --> 08:47.701
He'll ruin the evening.

08:47.744 --> 08:48.963
Uh, what would ruin the evening?

08:49.006 --> 08:51.574
I told you-- didn't close
the door properly.

08:53.445 --> 08:54.882
Are we having a house meeting?

08:56.797 --> 08:58.973
-No.
-No.

08:59.016 --> 09:01.410
So, your gathering here...

09:01.453 --> 09:03.586
is just a coincidence?

09:03.630 --> 09:05.457
Yes.

09:06.894 --> 09:08.678
COLIN:
My name is Colin Robinson.

09:08.722 --> 09:10.680
And I am what's known as

09:10.724 --> 09:12.595
a psychic vampire.

09:12.639 --> 09:14.379
Or energy vampire.

09:14.423 --> 09:16.033
This is my office.

09:16.077 --> 09:18.470
Also known
as the hunting ground.

09:18.514 --> 09:20.516
Hi, Deb.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.040
Energy vampires drain
people's energy

09:23.084 --> 09:24.651
merely by talking to them.

09:24.694 --> 09:27.741
Actual v. Budget,
year-to-date, no thanks.

09:27.784 --> 09:28.959
You're gonna be at that all day.

09:29.003 --> 09:30.961
We either bore you

09:31.005 --> 09:32.963
with a long conversation...

09:33.007 --> 09:35.531
Feeling better now, I was
a little sick this weekend.

09:37.315 --> 09:38.969
Hey, Don.

09:39.013 --> 09:40.405
Don?

09:40.449 --> 09:42.016
I have to pee, too.

09:42.059 --> 09:43.278
Or...

09:43.321 --> 09:44.322
Hey.

09:44.366 --> 09:45.323
...we enrage you.

09:47.369 --> 09:50.633
In fact, you probably know
an energy vampire.

09:50.677 --> 09:52.504
We're the most common kind...

09:52.548 --> 09:54.289
of vampire.

09:55.899 --> 09:58.467
We are day-walkers,
not affected by the sun.

10:00.469 --> 10:03.690
And we are
the only kind of vampire

10:03.733 --> 10:06.693
that can drain
another vampire's energy.

10:06.736 --> 10:09.478
It's very cool.

10:11.959 --> 10:14.875
The power grows stronger
in him by the night.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.710
GUILLERMO: There's different kinds of jobs that I have to do.

10:23.753 --> 10:26.930
Keep the house tidy.

10:26.974 --> 10:28.149
Make sure there's no sunlight.

10:30.760 --> 10:33.284
Sunlight! Why, Guillermo,

10:33.328 --> 10:37.114
why?!

10:38.159 --> 10:40.683
Not on my watch.

10:40.727 --> 10:42.685
Getting rid of carcasses,

10:42.729 --> 10:44.774
I feel, is a big one.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.347
So, we are under the stairs
and this is my bedroom.

10:53.740 --> 10:56.612
This is a picture of me
as Armand

10:56.656 --> 10:58.570
from Interview with the Vampire.

10:58.614 --> 11:00.572
Played by Antonio Banderas.

11:00.616 --> 11:02.966
That was the first time
I've ever seen

11:03.010 --> 11:04.838
an Hispanic vampire

11:04.881 --> 11:08.145
in mainstream, like, movies.

11:08.189 --> 11:11.105
And I said,
"If he can do it, I-I...

11:11.148 --> 11:12.715
I can do it."

11:12.759 --> 11:14.848
Guillermo... boarded
this whole window up,

11:14.891 --> 11:16.719
it's a huge sunlight risk.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.329
We wouldn't want the Baron
waking up to sunlight

11:18.373 --> 11:20.331
and being turned into
barbecue meat.

11:20.375 --> 11:22.333
Yeah, really cover it.

11:22.377 --> 11:23.944
He's made a lot of comments
recently, like,

11:23.987 --> 11:26.381
"I'm going to make you
a vampire."

11:26.424 --> 11:29.210
This is a little coffin toy
that, uh...

11:29.253 --> 11:31.865
I hope to be
in one of these one day.

11:31.908 --> 11:33.910
What ho, good friends.

11:33.954 --> 11:35.607
LARPERS:
What ho!

11:35.651 --> 11:38.915
There's still a few places
to find virgins.

11:38.959 --> 11:41.875
LARPing stands for
Live Action Role Playing.

11:41.918 --> 11:44.616
In regular life,
I'm just Jonathan.

11:44.660 --> 11:47.968
But here, I am
a very high-level paladin.

11:48.011 --> 11:49.012
GUILLERMO:
I'm not a killer.

11:49.056 --> 11:52.015
I find people who are easy...

11:52.059 --> 11:54.539
to... kill.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.019
Is that a 14th-century
battle-ax?

11:56.063 --> 11:57.804
Oh, it's so exciting.

11:57.847 --> 11:59.675
Uh, will we be able
to touch the swords?

12:00.720 --> 12:02.809
Oh, you'll touch the swords.

12:04.985 --> 12:06.943
NADJA:
We moved here from Europe

12:06.987 --> 12:09.337
about 200 years ago
because there was

12:09.380 --> 12:12.906
a lot of prejudice  against vampires at that time.

12:17.649 --> 12:19.260
They don't like
the color of our skin.

12:19.303 --> 12:21.784
Or the fact that
we killed and ate people.

12:21.828 --> 12:24.787
Probably more that.

12:24.831 --> 12:27.834
LASZLO:
We're being very careful
not to stand out,

12:27.877 --> 12:29.836
which is why
we're both dressed down.

12:29.879 --> 12:32.839
-Uh, good evening.
-Go back to your own country.

12:32.882 --> 12:34.797
What the fuck did you just say?

12:34.841 --> 12:36.625
You heard me,
Ghost of Christmas Past bitch.

12:36.668 --> 12:37.974
Oh, Mike, shut up.

12:38.018 --> 12:40.890
Silence to you.
We've been here since 1861.

12:40.934 --> 12:44.198
At least, our families have.

12:44.241 --> 12:45.982
Begone.

12:46.026 --> 12:48.289
We should just suck their blood,I'm absolutely starving.

12:48.332 --> 12:49.899
-They're perfect.
-No, I'm furious.

12:49.943 --> 12:51.509
He just insulted me,
I'm in fifth gear.

12:51.553 --> 12:53.511
-We should kill them.
-Yes, that's what I'm saying.

12:53.555 --> 12:55.905
-We should suck their blood.
-Yes.

12:57.298 --> 12:58.821
-LASZLO: Now?
-NADJA: Wait. Wait, darling.

12:58.865 --> 13:01.476
-Now?
-Now!

13:01.519 --> 13:03.695
What?

13:03.739 --> 13:05.523
-Mike?

13:05.567 --> 13:06.960
Where the fuck are you?

13:08.439 --> 13:09.701
What the fuck?

13:13.488 --> 13:15.751
Yum, yum, yum. He was delicious.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.622
Now, listen,
I don't know about you,

13:17.666 --> 13:20.103
but I'm very much in the mood
for some sexual intercourse.

13:22.018 --> 13:24.325
Darling. Right next
to the public toilet?

13:24.368 --> 13:26.327
Yes. But why don't I get home,

13:26.370 --> 13:28.982
get cleaned up, then we can
carry on with our love-making.

13:29.025 --> 13:31.245
Um, I'm going to walk home.

13:31.288 --> 13:33.203
--Why the hell would you do that?

13:33.247 --> 13:34.683
Why would you walk home?

13:34.726 --> 13:36.685
When you could turn into a bat?

13:36.728 --> 13:38.513
Bat!

13:43.953 --> 13:46.347
NANDOR:  I would like some of that, uh,

13:46.390 --> 13:49.002
colorful dust that sparkles.

13:49.045 --> 13:51.265
-Glitter?
-Yes.

13:51.308 --> 13:52.657
Get me some glitter.

13:52.701 --> 13:54.311
Whatever for, Master?

13:54.355 --> 13:56.139
Oh, I want to do
something special

13:56.183 --> 13:57.924
for the Immortal One's arrival.

13:57.967 --> 14:01.275
I'm going to sprinkle it
on my face and on my body.

14:01.318 --> 14:03.364
Like Twilight.

14:05.279 --> 14:08.151
So deliciously macabre.

14:08.195 --> 14:11.111
-Creepy paper.
-It's crepe paper.

14:11.154 --> 14:13.765
-Creepy paper.
-It's crepe paper, Master.

14:13.809 --> 14:16.812
Creepy... Oh, multipack.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.510
Master, this is
pretty "macarbre."

14:24.951 --> 14:28.171
NANDOR:
Guillermo is my familiar,

14:28.215 --> 14:30.608
but sometimes he's a little toofamiliar, you know what I mean?

14:30.652 --> 14:32.262
I mean, he's always
just there.

14:32.306 --> 14:34.047
I think it's good, Master.

14:34.090 --> 14:35.787
NANDOR:
I mean, he works really hard,

14:35.831 --> 14:37.267
he's just not great at it.

14:37.311 --> 14:39.182
Guillermo, my cape is stuck.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.185
I don't like saying
this kind of thing

14:42.229 --> 14:43.926
in front of him, of course.

14:43.970 --> 14:46.320
Sorry, Guillermo.

14:46.363 --> 14:48.713
I don't like saying this kind
of thing in front of you.

14:48.757 --> 14:50.846
That's okay, Master.

14:57.070 --> 14:58.201
Lot of glitter.

15:00.551 --> 15:02.510
-Cash or card?
-Credit.

15:02.553 --> 15:04.077
You cannot pay with that.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.817
GUILLERMO:
I'm so sorry.

15:05.861 --> 15:08.081
-Did you just throw a coin
at me?
-Yes.

15:08.124 --> 15:10.126
Sir, you can't be throwing
ancient coins at me.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.954
-Just... Credit card's fine.
-Guillermo, stab this man.

15:11.998 --> 15:14.043
-He's joking.
-Stab him.

15:14.087 --> 15:15.610
-Ahh...
-Thank you.

15:15.653 --> 15:17.525
-I tried, and...
-Here you go, man.

15:17.568 --> 15:19.744
-Thank you so much.
-You kind of disobeyed me
just now.

15:19.788 --> 15:20.789
And I'm noting it.

15:26.012 --> 15:29.102
NADJA:
Recently I have been
seeing another man.

15:32.105 --> 15:35.847
He doesn't see me, though,
because I sneak behind him.

15:40.504 --> 15:43.333
I watch him in the night,

15:43.377 --> 15:44.726
in secret.

15:59.262 --> 16:01.090
In the old country,
centuries ago,

16:01.134 --> 16:03.353
I was in a very passionate
love affair

16:03.397 --> 16:05.138
with a human man called Gregor.

16:05.181 --> 16:07.575
He was a knight.

16:07.618 --> 16:10.186
He got decapitated
in battle.

16:10.230 --> 16:13.276
I don't think I ever really
got over Gregor.

16:13.320 --> 16:15.061
Even when I met Laszlo.

16:15.104 --> 16:16.888
June, I've lost my boot.

16:16.932 --> 16:19.630
June?

16:19.674 --> 16:21.067
Come on, June.

16:21.110 --> 16:22.807
The man I saw last night,

16:22.851 --> 16:24.635
I think it is him.

16:24.679 --> 16:28.161
I think it is my reincarnated
ex-boyfriend Gregor,

16:28.204 --> 16:29.814
with his head.

16:29.858 --> 16:30.859
LASZLO:
Put it on, June.

16:30.902 --> 16:33.166
-Shut up, Laszlo!
-Yes, there we are.

16:33.209 --> 16:34.863
Boot on.

16:38.127 --> 16:40.303
Okay, it's just
down here somewhere.

16:40.347 --> 16:42.436
Why haven't I been to
this part of the house before?

16:42.479 --> 16:44.090
It's so lovely.

16:44.133 --> 16:45.961
-No one has for 80 years.
- Gorgeous.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.310
What are we doing down here?

16:47.354 --> 16:49.051
There is a chamber, okay?

16:49.095 --> 16:51.053
It's going to be perfect
for the bloodfeast.

16:51.097 --> 16:52.837
If we have the ceremony
in here,

16:52.881 --> 16:55.275
then you-know-who
won't even need to know.

16:55.318 --> 16:57.146
I mean Colin.

16:57.190 --> 17:00.149
-Colin, what are you doing
in here?
-Oh...

17:00.193 --> 17:03.065
This is my bedroom.
I'm resting.

17:05.111 --> 17:06.199
-You idiot.

17:06.242 --> 17:07.635
I didn't know he was
gonna be in there.

17:07.678 --> 17:09.506
-Why didn't you check?

17:09.550 --> 17:11.987
It's fine, we're gonna have
the ceremony in the attic.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.771
We can't,
the StairMaster's in there.

17:13.815 --> 17:15.686
Well, we're going to move
the StairMaster.

17:18.385 --> 17:21.475
LASZLO:
Is it definitely this boat?

17:21.518 --> 17:22.998
NANDOR:
There he is.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.434
NADJA:
I knew he'd have a big box.

17:24.478 --> 17:27.350
June, you need to go
and fetch him.

17:30.266 --> 17:32.138
WHARFINGER:
Sir, I just need someone
to sign for it.

17:32.181 --> 17:35.010
-Where's the pen?
-So, the tablet is the paper.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.143
Your finger is the pen.

17:37.186 --> 17:39.536
Okay, that's weird.

17:39.580 --> 17:41.451
Okay, that's nothing.

17:41.495 --> 17:43.497
Both of you, for some reason,
aren't registering here.

17:43.540 --> 17:44.976
You got long nails maybe
or something?

17:45.020 --> 17:46.108
Would you like a go, Laszlo?

17:46.152 --> 17:48.154
-Do you have a quill?
-No, it's all digital.

17:48.197 --> 17:49.894
Then I'm not signing that.

17:49.938 --> 17:51.592
Guillermo, give me your hand.

17:51.635 --> 17:54.247
-Ah.
-Okay!

17:55.987 --> 17:57.554
GUILLERMO:
I think the baron
might be here

17:57.598 --> 17:59.687
to see me become a vampire.

17:59.730 --> 18:02.690
That would be really cool.

18:02.733 --> 18:06.041
I'm ready.

18:09.523 --> 18:11.351
NADJA:
I should be preparing
for the bloodfeast,

18:11.394 --> 18:14.702
but I can't seem to stay away
from new Gregor.

18:14.745 --> 18:18.227
Man. Human man. Man!

18:20.316 --> 18:22.579
-S-Sorry, what did you say?
-Gregor,

18:22.623 --> 18:23.798
it is you.

18:23.841 --> 18:25.365
Oh, my name is Jeff.

18:25.408 --> 18:28.803
-Jeff?
-J-Jeff Suckler.

18:28.846 --> 18:31.762
My sweet Greg... Jeff S...

18:31.806 --> 18:33.590
Really-- J-Jeff Suckler?

18:33.634 --> 18:36.419
-Yeah.
-Ew.

18:42.556 --> 18:45.080
I call that "Nadja's Theme."

18:53.001 --> 18:54.742
Guillermo, are the virgins
arriving soon?

18:54.785 --> 18:57.223
They should be
any minute now, Master.

18:57.266 --> 18:58.354
-Fingers crossed.

18:58.398 --> 18:59.660
Sorry.

18:59.703 --> 19:02.097
Don't do that.

19:03.403 --> 19:06.101
Ah. Dinner is served.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.407
Yum, yum, yum, yum,
yum, yum, yum....

19:08.886 --> 19:11.062
Hello.
So glad you could make it.

19:11.106 --> 19:12.368
Please come in, quickly.

19:15.806 --> 19:18.331
Everyone, this is Jenna
and Jonathan.

19:18.374 --> 19:19.767
-Hi.
-Hi.

19:19.810 --> 19:20.811
Are you virgins?

19:20.855 --> 19:22.073
LASZLO:
Mm.

19:22.117 --> 19:23.466
I don't see how that's relevant.

19:23.510 --> 19:24.685
-Mm.
-I'm actually

19:24.728 --> 19:26.426
in a relationship online,

19:26.469 --> 19:29.037
but we've yet to meet IRL.

19:29.080 --> 19:31.648
Well done, Guillermo.

19:31.692 --> 19:32.867
Yeah.

19:32.910 --> 19:34.260
JONATHAN:
All right, okay, let's do it.

19:37.306 --> 19:39.221
Are they a vampire LARP group?

19:39.265 --> 19:40.788
Yeah, well, why don't we
wait in here?

19:40.831 --> 19:42.485
The party's gonna start
in a few minutes,

19:42.529 --> 19:45.227
so we can just hang out,
and I'll come get you when...

19:47.490 --> 19:49.013
GUILLERMO:
No. No, no, no!
No, no, no, no.

19:49.057 --> 19:51.146
No, no, no.
I said no!

19:54.758 --> 19:57.587
We take our LARPing
very seriously.

19:57.631 --> 20:01.374
And that was just an example.
I wanted you to see that.

20:01.417 --> 20:03.506
I'm inspired.

20:03.550 --> 20:05.639
So, are you a knight?

20:05.682 --> 20:07.902
Yeah, I'm...
Well, no, uh, sorry.

20:07.945 --> 20:09.947
I thought you were
gonna say "night watchman."

20:09.991 --> 20:11.471
I'm a-I'm a night watchman

20:11.514 --> 20:13.473
Mmm.

20:13.516 --> 20:15.866
Protector of the people.

20:15.910 --> 20:17.477
Oh, no, not-not really.

20:22.525 --> 20:26.181
Oh, my sweet Gregor-Jeff,

20:26.225 --> 20:29.532
I forgot how much ofa fantastic raconteur you were.

20:29.576 --> 20:30.533
-Oh, yeah.

20:30.577 --> 20:31.752
Oh, yeah, yeah.

20:31.795 --> 20:33.449
Ooh, do you remember
that first time

20:33.493 --> 20:36.147
that we made love,
and it was so passionate

20:36.191 --> 20:37.888
that I accidentally
cut off your head?

20:37.932 --> 20:39.499
-No. What?
-Mm!

20:39.542 --> 20:42.284
But then I kept going, squeezing

20:42.328 --> 20:44.504
until my needs were met. Hmm.

20:44.547 --> 20:46.375
We should do that again.

20:46.419 --> 20:49.073
But I mustn't.
But I want to.

20:49.117 --> 20:50.423
But you can't.

20:50.466 --> 20:52.686
But I have been married
for such a long time.

20:52.729 --> 20:54.427
-Oh.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.215
-I must go.
-Okay.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.521
-Let me just get your number
before you go...

21:01.564 --> 21:03.523
...so we can... I can...
we can do that again.

21:03.566 --> 21:06.134
Uh...

21:09.920 --> 21:11.574
-You're late.
-NANDOR: Throw it.

21:11.618 --> 21:13.489
That's it.

21:13.533 --> 21:15.752
Okay, Guillermo.

21:15.796 --> 21:20.670
We three... not counting
Guillermo... or June...

21:20.714 --> 21:22.759
or you...

21:22.803 --> 21:25.501
are gathered here in accordancewith the ancient...

21:25.545 --> 21:26.763
Get on with it.

21:26.807 --> 21:28.156
-NADJA: Get on with it.
-Guys.

21:28.199 --> 21:30.376
-In bearings with the ordinance-

21:30.419 --> 21:33.466
of the nine generations
that have surpassed us

21:33.509 --> 21:36.338
before this historic
and memorable moment.

21:37.948 --> 21:41.212
Guillermo, open the casket

21:41.256 --> 21:43.606
of Baron Afanas.

21:44.825 --> 21:46.609
-Oh...

21:46.653 --> 21:48.437
Oh, it opens all by itself.

21:48.481 --> 21:50.483
It's so cool.

21:51.440 --> 21:55.183
♪ In nomine Patris♪

21:55.226 --> 21:59.274

21:59.318 --> 22:02.451

22:06.803 --> 22:08.762
LASZLO:
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa...

22:08.805 --> 22:11.547
I say, old chap,
that's our familiar.

22:18.859 --> 22:20.077
Good God.

22:20.121 --> 22:21.644
Guillermo, did you see?

22:21.688 --> 22:23.298
He ate the familiar.

22:26.127 --> 22:28.172
That's scary.

22:28.216 --> 22:30.653
Ne la materia

22:30.697 --> 22:33.395
che mai non dorme

22:33.439 --> 22:38.269
re de le forme.

22:38.313 --> 22:42.578
I have risen again.

22:43.840 --> 22:45.755
Hello, Nadja.

22:45.799 --> 22:47.496
Hello.

22:47.540 --> 22:49.585
He's so hilarious.

22:49.629 --> 22:51.631
-Laszlo.
-LASZLO: Yes.

22:51.674 --> 22:54.285
I seem to remember him
having genitals.

22:54.329 --> 22:56.592
NADJA:
No, never. That is why he was
such a good lover.

22:56.636 --> 22:59.334
Guillermo, fetch the virgins.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.858
As an advocate of the old ways,

23:01.902 --> 23:04.644
-can I just apologize
for the crepe paper?
-NANDOR: Hey...

23:04.687 --> 23:06.689
It should have been
human skin, obviously.

23:06.733 --> 23:09.605
And I deeply apologize
for the StairMaster.

23:09.649 --> 23:12.216
-It's all his fault.
-I go through all this effort,
I get the creepy paper.

23:12.260 --> 23:14.305
-I get Guillermo to...
-LASZLO: It's not "creepy."

23:14.349 --> 23:15.829
It's crepepaper, crepe.

23:15.872 --> 23:19.049
Silence!

23:19.093 --> 23:23.532
I come with a proclamation.

23:24.707 --> 23:26.840
The old ways...

23:26.883 --> 23:29.451
are over.

23:29.495 --> 23:30.844
Which is what I just said.

23:30.887 --> 23:33.847
The New World, as you call it,

23:33.890 --> 23:35.892
is our lifeline

23:35.936 --> 23:39.243
to an eternal future.

23:39.287 --> 23:40.549
Si...

23:42.595 --> 23:44.727
It's a documentary crew.
They're cameras.

23:44.771 --> 23:46.163
It's like they're not even here.

23:46.207 --> 23:47.817
-They are filming me?
-Yes.

23:47.861 --> 23:49.471
NANDOR:
Just pretend
like they're not there.

23:49.515 --> 23:51.038
It's kind of a natural piece.

23:51.081 --> 23:52.735
You were saying, Baron?

23:52.779 --> 23:55.129
Centuries have passed,

23:55.172 --> 23:59.525
and you have not conquered
the New World.

23:59.568 --> 24:02.484
You hide in the shadows.

24:02.528 --> 24:04.530
Bah. You are weak.

24:04.573 --> 24:05.705
JONATHAN:
Oh, God. Oh...

24:05.748 --> 24:07.489
NANDOR:
Not now, Guillermo.

24:07.533 --> 24:09.491
GUILLERMO:
Go, go, go. Go, go, go.

24:09.535 --> 24:11.188
-Go.
-BARON: Oh, by now,

24:11.232 --> 24:14.540
you should rule this,
this, uh...

24:14.583 --> 24:17.717
-what is this place again?
-Staten Island.

24:17.760 --> 24:19.762
This Staten Island.

24:22.025 --> 24:24.680
Is this Staten Island
the seat of power

24:24.724 --> 24:26.639
in the New World?

24:26.682 --> 24:29.293
It is where the boat
dropped us off.

24:29.337 --> 24:32.645
Down with the old ways.
Up with t-the New World.

24:32.688 --> 24:35.517
I've been saying it for
centuries, and he would never

24:35.561 --> 24:37.780
-listen...
-Shh.

24:37.824 --> 24:41.697
Mm. I must slumber.

24:41.741 --> 24:43.699
But when I awaken,

24:43.743 --> 24:46.746
we will rule this...

24:46.789 --> 24:48.791
Staten Island.

24:48.835 --> 24:51.228
Y-Yes.

24:51.272 --> 24:52.665
-Yes!
-Yes.

24:52.708 --> 24:53.883
Nadja?

24:53.927 --> 24:56.930
Baron.

24:56.973 --> 25:00.760
-Laszlo.
-Baron.

25:00.803 --> 25:01.848
It's Nandor.

25:07.810 --> 25:09.203
LASZLO:
Thank God.

25:09.246 --> 25:10.596
NANDOR:
The Baron is furious with us.

25:10.639 --> 25:13.555
It's so dumb
that I wore glitter.

25:13.599 --> 25:14.774
Let's get rid of this shit.

25:14.817 --> 25:16.340
If we don't conquer
the New World,

25:16.384 --> 25:17.690
he's going to kill us.

25:17.733 --> 25:19.605
Again.

25:19.648 --> 25:22.433
-Basically, we're fucked.
-Fucked.

25:24.827 --> 25:26.786
NANDOR:
Well, that was
a complete disaster.

25:26.829 --> 25:28.831
At least we have the virgins.

25:30.311 --> 25:32.835
-Uh, yes.

25:36.709 --> 25:38.406
...for an economy car.

25:38.449 --> 25:40.626
-NANDOR: Oh, great.
-GUILLERMO: We're too late.

25:40.669 --> 25:43.585
Colin Robinson has drained themof all their energy.

25:43.629 --> 25:45.979
COLIN:
"How are you gonna
wash this car?"

25:46.022 --> 25:48.285
NANDOR:
They have
no nutritional value now.

25:48.329 --> 25:49.722
COLIN:
And I know you two said
you don't drive,

25:49.765 --> 25:51.637
and don't have
driver's licenses,

25:51.680 --> 25:53.726
but are you gonna do a...

25:53.769 --> 25:55.075
a-a different type
of car wash,

25:55.118 --> 25:57.643
maybe having detailing done?

25:57.686 --> 26:00.210
Now, detailing,
they go into your car

26:00.254 --> 26:02.735
and they get into the nooks
and crannies, so...

26:02.778 --> 26:05.302
Anyway, you take care, okay?

26:11.787 --> 26:13.746
You are glum, Guillermo.

26:13.789 --> 26:15.399
-: No.
-Yes.

26:15.443 --> 26:17.401
You think that I've forgotten
that tonight

26:17.445 --> 26:20.230
is a special occasion for you
as well, haven't you?

26:26.062 --> 26:28.543
Does not an anniversary
deserve a reward

26:28.587 --> 26:31.720
recognizing your years
of service?

26:33.026 --> 26:34.897
I'm ready, Master.

26:34.941 --> 26:36.507
Good.

26:36.551 --> 26:39.075
Prepare yourself.

26:43.689 --> 26:46.692
Happy anniversary, Guillermo.

26:50.957 --> 26:54.656
-Wow...
-It's a glitter portrait.

26:54.700 --> 26:58.921
It's a portrait
made from glitter.

26:58.965 --> 27:00.706
Look, it's you.

27:00.749 --> 27:03.099
I made you a vampire.

27:03.143 --> 27:04.710
And look who's next to you.

27:04.753 --> 27:06.102
It's me.

27:06.146 --> 27:08.801
-Wow.
-Enjoy it.

27:08.844 --> 27:11.934
You can put it
in your depressing room.

27:11.978 --> 27:16.156
And you deserve it.
Two years of service.

27:16.199 --> 27:17.853
T-Ten.

27:17.897 --> 27:19.725
Ten years of service.

27:19.768 --> 27:22.902
-Ten.
-Ten years of service?

27:25.644 --> 27:27.820
Okay.
