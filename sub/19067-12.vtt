01:07.734 --> 01:11.113
Thank you, Ryner, for all you
and the Olkari have done to assist us.

01:11.947 --> 01:13.657
Once we defeat Zarkon,

01:13.740 --> 01:17.327
it is my hope that we can continue
to unite our forces

01:17.411 --> 01:21.498
and rebuild the once great coalition
that my father, King Alfor, began.

01:21.582 --> 01:24.918
[all cheering]

01:26.295 --> 01:28.297
Princess, it's time.

01:34.761 --> 01:37.764
Everyone lock into position.
We're taking this thing up.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.521
<i>Princess, we are go for launch.</i>

01:45.856 --> 01:47.107
Charging main turbine.

02:08.252 --> 02:12.924
Commander Thace, you have sent
encrypted messages to outside forces.

02:13.008 --> 02:16.094
Of this, we are keenly aware.

02:16.178 --> 02:20.265
Encryptions can be broken, just like you.

02:22.517 --> 02:24.478
[screaming]

02:29.483 --> 02:32.736
It was you who destroyed the sentries
and powered down the solar barrier.

02:32.819 --> 02:35.113
You allowed Voltron to escape.

02:35.197 --> 02:37.616
You betrayed Zarkon!

02:37.699 --> 02:40.827
Who else is part of this conspiracy?

02:40.911 --> 02:43.413
[screaming]

02:43.497 --> 02:46.458
[screaming continues]

02:48.418 --> 02:50.087
All right, guys, listen up.

02:50.170 --> 02:53.340
I'll use the Black Lion to lure
Zarkon's fleet to our current location

02:53.423 --> 02:56.093
and make sure he's within
the teludav's area of effect.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.136
Keeping the teludav hidden
behind the space-fold

02:58.220 --> 03:01.264
until the last possible second
is essential.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.016
We can count on you, right, Slav?

03:03.100 --> 03:05.435
Absolutely. I'll be fine.

03:06.395 --> 03:08.772
I'm not sure about
the gravity generator, though.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.565
What? What was that last thing?

03:10.649 --> 03:12.150
Hiding a ship is one thing,

03:12.234 --> 03:14.486
but I've never had to build
a gravity generator

03:14.569 --> 03:16.530
for something this large before.

03:16.613 --> 03:20.158
I know it'll work,
but I'm not really sure for how long.

03:21.493 --> 03:23.495
Well, that's a risk we'll have to take.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.164
Once Zarkon's ship is in position,

03:26.248 --> 03:28.667
Kolivan and Antok
will coordinate with Thace.

03:28.750 --> 03:33.505
Together, they'll take down Zarkon's
security system and upload the virus.

03:33.588 --> 03:35.882
And then, he'll be a sitting du-flax.

03:39.678 --> 03:43.849
What? A du-flax is an Altean creature
with a beak and webbed feet.

03:43.932 --> 03:46.768
We'll wormhole Zarkon
500 million light years away,

03:46.852 --> 03:49.896
and he'll be in the Yggiz Galaxy
before he knows what's hit him!

03:50.939 --> 03:53.567
-What about Thace?
-He should be getting into position now.

03:53.650 --> 03:56.528
We received his last communication
three quintants ago.

03:56.611 --> 03:58.572
We should hear from him soon.

03:58.655 --> 03:59.740
Let's do it.

04:15.881 --> 04:18.300
[groaning]

04:20.260 --> 04:22.137
Why do you disturb me?

04:22.220 --> 04:24.389
My apologies, sire.

04:24.473 --> 04:27.559
-I fear your singular focus has--
-Has what?

04:28.477 --> 04:31.146
I've overstepped my bounds.

04:31.229 --> 04:36.443
We've apprehended a spy within our ranks.
He plans something with an outside force.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.612
I suspect an attack is imminent.

04:38.695 --> 04:42.824
Let your druids find out what he knows.
You will stay here.

04:42.908 --> 04:46.536
The only thing that matters to me
is getting the Black Lion.

04:46.620 --> 04:50.040
I need the power you possess
to search the galaxy.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.019
[gasps]

05:11.102 --> 05:12.729
[groaning]

05:12.813 --> 05:15.190
[panting]

05:15.273 --> 05:18.235
I have found the lion.

05:19.402 --> 05:23.782
Get the fleet into hyper drive!
I know where the Black Lion is.

05:26.910 --> 05:29.204
<i>Zarkon took the bait.</i>
<i>He's got my location.</i>

05:29.287 --> 05:30.831
<i>Is everybody in position?</i>

05:30.914 --> 05:32.499
We've not yet heard from Thace.

05:32.582 --> 05:35.293
He was supposed to contact us
two vargas ago.

05:35.377 --> 05:37.128
He could've been captured.

05:37.212 --> 05:39.548
Or killed. We need to abort
the mission immediately.

05:39.631 --> 05:40.840
Abort?

05:40.924 --> 05:42.968
No! We cannot back away now.

05:43.051 --> 05:45.845
The Blade of Marmora
does not take chances.

05:45.929 --> 05:48.098
It's how we've survived for so long.

05:48.181 --> 05:52.561
It's held you back. Your caution
is the reason Zarkon is still in power.

05:52.644 --> 05:54.938
We would rather wait
than jeopardize everything.

05:55.021 --> 05:58.358
Besides, it's too late
to get someone else on the inside.

05:58.441 --> 05:59.859
-I'll do it.
-What?

05:59.943 --> 06:01.403
I'll sneak onto Zarkon's ship.

06:01.486 --> 06:04.573
I'm Galra, so I'll be able to interact
with their technology.

06:04.656 --> 06:07.826
Pidge, you can rig up one of those pods
with a cloaking device, right?

06:07.909 --> 06:08.743
Well, yeah.

06:08.827 --> 06:11.121
Going onto Zarkon's ship
is a suicide mission.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.415
I would never command
someone so inexperienced

06:13.498 --> 06:15.166
to go on a mission so dangerous.

06:15.250 --> 06:18.670
No one's commanding me. I'm doing it.

06:22.173 --> 06:24.259
Pidge, get that pod ready.

06:24.342 --> 06:25.343
Keith...

06:26.052 --> 06:29.014
Let me know when you're on your way.
I'll give you cover.

06:30.390 --> 06:33.268
Okay, the cloaking device is ready to go.

06:33.351 --> 06:34.352
Pidge...

06:35.395 --> 06:37.147
May I have a moment with Keith, please?

06:40.066 --> 06:42.777
Sure thing. Have all the moments you like.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.076
Is there something I can help you with?

06:50.160 --> 06:52.829
I... I just wanted to say...

06:53.872 --> 06:58.293
the Galra, they've done terrible things.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.587
Destroyed entire civilizations.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.881
They took my family.

07:03.965 --> 07:08.762
But, in time, I've grown to consider
you and the paladins my family.

07:09.846 --> 07:12.974
So, when I learned you were Galra, I...

07:13.058 --> 07:14.726
I didn't know what to think.

07:14.809 --> 07:16.603
I wanted to hate you.

07:16.686 --> 07:17.687
Allura...

07:18.396 --> 07:20.649
-It's--
-But it's not you.

07:20.732 --> 07:25.320
It's me. My anger has
blinded me for too long.

07:29.616 --> 07:32.661
I'm so sorry I misjudged you.

07:32.744 --> 07:35.830
You've proven,
it's not what's in your blood.

07:35.914 --> 07:37.916
It's who you are that counts.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.168
Please come back to us.

07:41.211 --> 07:42.212
I will.

07:43.922 --> 07:45.590
[beeping]

07:49.219 --> 07:50.095
They're here.

08:18.581 --> 08:20.959
<i>Send the fighters! Surround that lion!</i>

08:21.042 --> 08:22.711
<i>Draw him in!</i>

08:25.130 --> 08:29.968
<i>I want every ship in the fleet</i>
<i>after that lion. Get me closer!</i>

08:34.431 --> 08:36.474
I've got Zarkon on the hook.
Bringing him your way.

08:36.558 --> 08:39.561
<i>Keith, you ready?</i>
<i>We've only got one shot at this!</i>

08:39.644 --> 08:41.270
Engaging cloaking device.

08:42.938 --> 08:44.524
<i>Moving toward the fleet now.</i>

08:44.607 --> 08:47.360
Roger that. I don't see you,
but I'm locked on your signal.

08:47.444 --> 08:48.486
I'll clear a path.

09:10.592 --> 09:13.344
Thanks, Shiro. I'm coming in hot!

09:15.847 --> 09:18.099
[grunting]

09:23.855 --> 09:24.731
I'm in.

09:24.814 --> 09:29.069
The plan is working. Keith is on board
and Zarkon's fleet is on the way.

09:29.152 --> 09:31.321
The Castle of Lion defenses are up
and ready to go.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.657
Starting gravity generator now.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.910
[Slav]
<i>Commencing cloak.</i>

10:01.434 --> 10:05.688
[screaming]

10:05.772 --> 10:07.649
[groaning]

10:08.274 --> 10:10.485
We are tracking the Black Lion.

10:10.568 --> 10:13.071
We know this is part of a bigger plan.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.160
Where is he going?

10:40.723 --> 10:41.850
[grunts]

10:43.351 --> 10:46.229
[Kolivan] <i>Okay, you've made it</i>
<i>to the lower communication deck.</i>

10:46.312 --> 10:48.606
<i>Head left down that corridor.</i>

10:50.775 --> 10:52.610
[Antok]
<i>Based on the schematics from Thace,</i>

10:52.694 --> 10:54.904
<i>there should be a large door up ahead.</i>

10:54.988 --> 10:58.241
<i>This is the central hub</i>
<i>for the Galra fleet.</i>

10:59.075 --> 11:00.076
I see it.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.878
I'm two minutes out. Is everybody ready?

11:11.129 --> 11:13.798
[Kolivan]
<i>No, Keith hasn't made it to the hub yet.</i>

11:13.882 --> 11:16.467
<i>-We need more time.</i>
-[grunting]

11:16.551 --> 11:17.886
How much more?

11:17.969 --> 11:22.724
I hope not much because my gravity
generator is not going to run forever!

11:22.807 --> 11:27.103
<i>I don't know how much longer I can hold</i>
<i>Zarkon's fleet in this position by myself!</i>

11:29.564 --> 11:30.940
[Pidge]
<i>You won't have to!</i>

11:33.693 --> 11:35.361
Good timing.

11:35.445 --> 11:38.281
Okay, we've got Zarkon's ship
right where it needs to be.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.575
We gotta keep it here
until that virus is uploaded.

11:40.658 --> 11:41.701
Let's do it!

11:41.784 --> 11:43.536
-All right!
-We got this!

11:52.378 --> 11:56.341
Flank the Black Lion! Surround him!

11:56.424 --> 11:58.635
Sire, I fear this could be a trap!

11:58.718 --> 12:02.221
Get me more power.
I must connect to the Black Lion.

12:11.314 --> 12:13.650
Kolivan, I'm in. Now, what?

12:13.733 --> 12:17.278
<i>Now, you need to reset the system,</i>
<i>using the codes that Thace obtained.</i>

12:17.362 --> 12:20.949
<i>It'll be down for a dobosh.</i>
<i>That's when we'll upload the virus.</i>

12:21.032 --> 12:24.661
-[rapid beeping]
-It doesn't seem to be working.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.412
-<i>Try it again.</i>
-[door beeps]

12:31.334 --> 12:33.169
<i>Keith, are you there?</i>

12:43.388 --> 12:46.432
And now, we know you were attempting
to shut down the system.

12:52.522 --> 12:54.440
You're too late.

12:54.524 --> 12:57.068
No, Thace. You're too late.

12:57.151 --> 12:59.112
We already changed the code.

12:59.195 --> 13:02.198
[rapid beeping]

13:06.995 --> 13:09.414
[screams]

13:33.938 --> 13:35.523
[screams]

13:40.486 --> 13:43.573
Thace, I'm Keith, a Paladin of Voltron.

13:44.741 --> 13:47.201
And a fellow Blade, I see.

13:47.285 --> 13:48.745
I guess we haven't failed.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.204
Not yet.

14:00.256 --> 14:02.091
[grunting]

14:08.222 --> 14:10.391
Yeah! That was close.

14:10.475 --> 14:14.228
-Somebody! Anybody! A little help here!
-Lure them to me!

14:26.115 --> 14:29.202
[beeping]

14:29.285 --> 14:32.205
Zarkon's ship is leaving
the teludav's area of effect.

14:32.288 --> 14:34.040
You must guide it back in.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.258
This is getting hairy.
How you doing, Keith?

14:45.343 --> 14:48.262
The Galra switched the codes.
We're trying a work-around.

14:48.346 --> 14:50.056
[Lance]
<i>"We"? Who's "we"?</i>

14:50.139 --> 14:53.935
-Thace. I found him. I'll explain later.
-[Shiro] <i>Copy that.</i>

14:56.771 --> 14:58.314
What exactly are you doing?

14:58.398 --> 15:01.275
I'm using the main power
to overload the system.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.028
You're turning the room into a bomb?

15:05.238 --> 15:06.614
It's the only way.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.538
Thace has barricaded himself
in the central hub.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.623
We believe he's trying
to shut down the system.

15:17.959 --> 15:20.753
[Haggar] He's working
with the paladins. It was a trap.

15:20.837 --> 15:23.381
[panting]

15:23.464 --> 15:27.176
Get the spy. I will end this firefight.

15:27.885 --> 15:31.431
[whimpering]

15:31.514 --> 15:36.436
Uh, everyone, the gravity generator
won't maintain power much longer.

15:36.519 --> 15:39.897
If it goes down, we're just going
to be uncloaked in open space.

15:39.981 --> 15:43.067
[Shiro] <i>Do all you can.</i>
<i>We just need to hold out a little longer.</i>

15:46.988 --> 15:48.906
[grunting]

16:11.262 --> 16:14.015
That solves one problem,
but now we're trapped in here.

16:14.098 --> 16:17.518
No, we're not. There's an exit
through the main power conduit.

16:17.602 --> 16:19.061
It leads to the second deck.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.398
Go, now.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.067
What? No, I'm not gonna leave you.

16:25.151 --> 16:28.279
You must. I will shut down the system.

16:28.362 --> 16:31.866
Paladin, this is where my journey ends,

16:31.949 --> 16:35.286
but, as a member of Voltron,
you have a bigger mission.

16:35.369 --> 16:36.871
You must understand that.

16:40.666 --> 16:43.336
It was an honor to meet you.

16:44.921 --> 16:47.131
Go! Now!

17:09.237 --> 17:11.239
[powering down]

17:14.075 --> 17:16.493
-[alarm blaring]
-Oh, I hate it when I'm right.

17:16.577 --> 17:19.204
The gravity generator just lost power!

17:19.288 --> 17:23.251
Now, there's no reality
where we all get out alive!

17:32.385 --> 17:35.304
Princess, the teludav
is completely exposed!

17:44.230 --> 17:45.565
Come on, Keith.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.831
-What do we do?
-We can't do anything.

18:01.914 --> 18:05.126
If Keith doesn't get Zarkon's ship
shut down, we're done for. It's over.

18:06.294 --> 18:09.672
Charge the ion cannon! Take it down!

18:10.339 --> 18:11.882
We cannot wait any longer.

18:11.966 --> 18:13.593
I'm powering the teludav now!

18:44.790 --> 18:46.000
[gasps]

18:46.083 --> 18:47.251
[screams]

18:49.337 --> 18:51.547
[grunting]

19:04.769 --> 19:07.855
[grunting, panting]

19:08.939 --> 19:09.774
[growls]

19:14.403 --> 19:17.823
The system is down. Uploading virus now.

19:37.259 --> 19:39.345
No!

19:45.476 --> 19:46.769
Thace did it.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.024
[purring]

20:40.114 --> 20:42.867
[grunting]

20:52.543 --> 20:55.004
Everyone, hang on! Here we go!

21:04.138 --> 21:05.139
[Koran]
<i>Hurry, Paladins!</i>
