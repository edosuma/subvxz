[narrator] <i>Previously on</i> Dynasty:

00:13.471 --> 00:16.224
Fallon isn't my child. Steven is.

00:16.306 --> 00:19.227
-I need to go back to Paraguay.
-I'll go with you.

00:19.310 --> 00:20.311
I need to go alone.

00:20.395 --> 00:22.856
-I'm packed, ready to hit the road.
-You're not going anywhere.

00:22.939 --> 00:25.358
Names aren't what make a family.
People do.

00:26.443 --> 00:29.571
-Cristal. What are you doing here?
-I heard you might need me.

00:29.654 --> 00:32.490
I got you into an underground
billionaires' poker game.

00:32.573 --> 00:34.117
Keith, Mike Jones.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.368
What's up, Jones?

00:35.452 --> 00:36.828
-[bangs on door]
-Move, move, move.

00:36.911 --> 00:38.580
Down! Hands on your head!

00:38.663 --> 00:41.458
I was thinking you could stay on
for the transition team.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.376
I'll see you at the office, boss.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.420
This painting is collateral.

00:45.503 --> 00:47.547
-So, I'm not selling it?
-No.

-I want a rematch.
-Why is that? You think I was cheating?

01:33.259 --> 01:36.262
These past few days
have been... wonderful.

01:37.096 --> 01:40.809
I am starting
to fall in love... with Atlanta.

01:41.726 --> 01:42.727
[chuckles]

01:43.686 --> 01:45.939
What about Arizona and your job?

01:46.022 --> 01:49.901
I have a lot of vacation time saved up.
A month, maybe even two.

01:50.819 --> 01:53.947
The point is, Celia was there for me
when I needed her most,

01:54.030 --> 01:57.617
and I wanna do the same thing for you,
for as long as you need me.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.953
[cell phone ringing]

02:00.578 --> 02:03.331
I'm very needy. Excuse me.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.250
This is Blake.

02:06.709 --> 02:11.005
I've been staring at this all day.
It's literally corporate gibberish.

02:12.090 --> 02:13.174
Give me this.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.594
Okay, these are bilateral C-suite
feedback reports

02:16.678 --> 02:19.347
discussing the immediate trajectory
of the next--

02:20.348 --> 02:21.891
-Hmm?
-Are you even listening to me? I'll try harder.

02:24.018 --> 02:26.020
-Um...
-[cell phone beeps]

02:26.104 --> 02:29.149
-That's not good.
-What, your favorite porn site crashed?

02:32.485 --> 02:33.778
At least that outfit worked.

02:34.529 --> 02:38.616
My writer friend sent me this
along with an article his mag is printing

02:38.700 --> 02:41.870
about... our failing marriage.

02:41.953 --> 02:45.081
-Well, pay him to quash it.
-Well, he's not that good a friend.

02:45.665 --> 02:48.001
I don't know how long
you think this charade can continue.

02:48.084 --> 02:50.712
This deal was based on our marriage,
so, the merger--

02:50.795 --> 02:53.965
The merger is fine. The deal is done.
Everyone got their money.

02:54.048 --> 02:56.676
Your family has their money.
Mine could lose billions.

02:57.051 --> 03:00.096
And if that happens
because my wife is cheating on me,

03:00.179 --> 03:03.141
they're gonna come after you,
and I won't be able to protect you.

03:05.977 --> 03:07.520
You don't need to do this.

03:07.604 --> 03:10.982
Hey, you pulled me from Keith's game
in the nick of time. I owe you.

03:11.608 --> 03:14.110
I can't believe you clocked that raid
before I did.

03:14.777 --> 03:17.155
-Yeah, I got lucky.
-Let's hope you stay lucky,

03:17.238 --> 03:18.406
'cause as another thank-you

03:18.489 --> 03:20.825
I'm offering you a permanent seat
at my poker game.

03:20.909 --> 03:24.871
-Tuesday night, here at the club.
-You sure about this, after last night?

03:24.954 --> 03:27.332
I've been playing for years.
Never seen anything like that.

03:27.415 --> 03:30.168
You never know who you can trust
with millions on the table.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.003
What's that supposed to mean?

03:33.880 --> 03:36.341
If there's something I need to know,
you'd better say it.

03:37.133 --> 03:38.217
The raid at Keith's?

03:40.470 --> 03:41.471
I set it up.

03:45.225 --> 03:48.394
Cristal. I thought you were gone,
and then you came right back.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.689
Like a stubborn case of the clap.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.650
I did, yes.

03:53.942 --> 03:56.569
Blake needs a healthy support system
right now.

03:56.653 --> 04:00.865
After everything he's been through,
a sensitive person might recognize

04:00.949 --> 04:03.618
that now is not the time
for an outsider to be here.

04:04.702 --> 04:06.579
I'm sure he doesn't see you that way.

04:07.872 --> 04:10.250
Join me so we outsiders
can get to know each other.

04:10.792 --> 04:11.626
[chuckles]

04:11.709 --> 04:14.212
[in mocking accent]
Something's getting lost in translation.

04:14.295 --> 04:16.255
-[chuckles]
-[Blake] Oh, this is unbelievable.

04:17.382 --> 04:18.507
Is everything okay?

04:18.591 --> 04:21.678
Apparently, a painting of mine
that I didn't know was missing

04:21.761 --> 04:22.845
popped up at a gallery.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.723
The person attempting to sell it
matches Hank's description.

04:26.474 --> 04:29.811
Well, I can't believe that Hank
would show up here out of the blue

04:29.894 --> 04:31.771
with a stolen painting.

04:31.854 --> 04:32.772
The timing makes sense.

04:32.855 --> 04:35.566
He waited for the investigation
to die down before he tried to sell it.

04:35.650 --> 04:37.360
-How do they know it's him?
-They don't.

04:37.443 --> 04:41.364
But this is the first lead since the fire.
I am not gonna let him get away again.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.867
Son or no, he killed my wife.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.831
She's using the photo of me
paying the escort as blackmail,

04:49.914 --> 04:52.625
then having me through hoops
like setting up the raid.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.795
Then she kills the job in New York
and says I work for her.

04:55.878 --> 04:58.339
-Fallon doesn't know?
-No. I don't want her involved.

04:58.423 --> 05:01.134
Ada could ruin her,
and you if you host this poker game.

05:01.217 --> 05:03.511
I'm not afraid
of some crazy antiques dealer.

05:03.761 --> 05:07.432
She's connected and untouchable.
I don't even know where to find the lady.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.393
What if I host this game to lure her here?

05:10.852 --> 05:13.646
We deal with her face-to-face.
I at least owe you that.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.398
-It's too risky.
-Hey.

05:15.773 --> 05:19.652
I'm not letting anyone stop me from doing
my thing in my city, or control you.

05:21.904 --> 05:22.905
Fine.

05:30.538 --> 05:32.332
-[in Spanish]: Sounds good.
-[scoffs]

05:33.541 --> 05:34.834
No, I don't really play.

05:35.668 --> 05:36.711
Steven does.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.757
-You miss him.
-More than I thought I would.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.843
I mean, we FaceTime,
but it's not the same.

05:45.094 --> 05:48.306
And the one person
I'd like to talk to about it isn't here.

05:48.389 --> 05:49.515
You mean your <i> tía.</i>

05:51.309 --> 05:55.688
Okay. I don't want you to think I'm crazy,
but I might have a strange suggestion.

05:56.105 --> 05:57.523
Oh, that's my favorite kind.

05:58.524 --> 06:01.319
If you're feeling lost,
there are ways to know what's meant to be

06:01.402 --> 06:04.572
by looking inside yourself
or out into the universe. Are you talking about psychedelics?
The last time I did drugs,

06:08.409 --> 06:11.162
I put on a one-man musical
at my engagement party.

06:11.245 --> 06:14.957
No. I follow this psychic online, Adriana.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.960
She helps you face your past
or look into the future.

06:18.044 --> 06:22.882
She's done amazing things for people
by long distance... including me.

06:23.174 --> 06:24.467
She told you your future?

06:25.134 --> 06:27.303
She gave me guidance
about what was next for me.

06:27.678 --> 06:30.556
If you're already feeling lost,
what do you have to lose?

06:37.021 --> 06:38.856
I thought this was Fallon's office.

06:39.315 --> 06:40.399
It is.

06:40.483 --> 06:43.903
She's having me help her with some...
Some files.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.655
Thought you were a writer.

06:46.364 --> 06:49.325
I guess she thought
I'd be a valuable addition to her team.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.120
Or maybe she couldn't bear to see me go.

06:55.498 --> 06:58.918
Michael. I guess it's good
that both of you are here,

06:59.502 --> 07:02.505
since the three of us
are about to be the talk of the town.

07:03.548 --> 07:07.051
The article just broke.
Since I'm me, I have a plan.

07:08.094 --> 07:12.140
-We can't marry until we divorce.
-You're not really married.

07:12.223 --> 07:15.143
Announcing a divorce would take
a tiny piece of gossip chum

07:15.226 --> 07:16.561
and turn it into a feeding frenzy.

07:16.644 --> 07:18.771
Not if we have a divorce party.

07:18.855 --> 07:21.232
It's called "conscious uncoupling."
It's all the rage.

07:21.315 --> 07:23.151
Gwyneth started it, then Jack White.

07:23.234 --> 07:25.403
I'm sure J.Lo will be sending
save-the-end-dates soon.

07:25.486 --> 07:28.990
We'll have an amicable celebration
of our separation Tuesday at the Manor.

07:29.073 --> 07:31.868
-Tuesday is tough for me.
-It shouldn't be. It's our date night.

07:32.952 --> 07:33.911
I'll be there.

07:34.203 --> 07:36.289
This divorce will be like
the wedding we never had.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.626
I told you specifically
not to sell that painting.

07:40.710 --> 07:45.047
-I tried calling, but you never answered.
-Because I lost my phone in Paraguay.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.675
I don't know what that means.
I'm done listening to you.

07:47.758 --> 07:51.095
That art lady said
this painting is worth millions.

07:51.179 --> 07:55.141
Hank, please. They will throw you in jail,
and you will end up with nothing.

07:55.224 --> 07:58.686
If I get caught, this entire fake-son scam
of yours is exposed.

07:59.228 --> 08:02.064
<i>Laying low is for suckers.</i>
<i>This is Hank's big payback.</i>

08:02.148 --> 08:04.484
And he's finally gonna get what he's owed.

08:05.067 --> 08:07.862
What I'm owed. Me, Hank.

08:07.945 --> 08:10.031
-[line disconnects]
-[grunts]

08:32.678 --> 08:34.138
[chattering]

08:34.889 --> 08:37.600
-Hi.
-What says "I'm done with you" more:

08:38.351 --> 08:40.394
Alimony Punch or Banana Splitini?

08:40.477 --> 08:42.897
And yet I've seen actual brides
less invested.

08:43.981 --> 08:44.815
Splitini.

08:45.107 --> 08:48.611
It's like you're trying to make up
for the fact we never had a wedding.

08:48.986 --> 08:51.822
Maybe you're feeling something
you weren't anticipating?

08:51.906 --> 08:54.158
The only thing I'm feeling
is clearing my path

08:54.242 --> 08:55.576
for a spring wedding with Culhane.

08:58.162 --> 09:02.792
So, then,
why all the... attention to detail?

09:02.875 --> 09:06.087
Because just like our fake-ass marriage,
this has to feel real.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.464
You're right, it should.
For the shareholders.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.841
Which is why I've done my research,

09:10.925 --> 09:14.887
and evidently, there's rituals
that some people do at these things.

09:15.638 --> 09:16.514
Like?

09:16.597 --> 09:19.850
Well, there's the untying of the knot,
the parting vows.

09:20.434 --> 09:22.144
I'm even game for a last kiss.

09:23.479 --> 09:25.648
It's like you said, it has to feel real.

09:25.731 --> 09:28.651
I've given you everything you've asked
of me during this relationship.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.236
You call, I'm there.

09:30.611 --> 09:33.823
So, for this one night,
all I ask is that you give me the chance

09:34.156 --> 09:36.325
-to say goodbye my own way.
-Fine.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.037
But no last kiss.

09:43.291 --> 09:44.750
Keith, thanks for meeting me.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.919
Well, thanks for helping me make bail.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.213
I don't know how that bitch Ada Stone
got dirt on me,

09:49.297 --> 09:51.048
but I'm gonna bury her
for busting up my game.

09:51.132 --> 09:53.009
She is a scary person.

09:53.384 --> 09:56.637
-How do I know you didn't set me up?
-Would I be seeking you out if I did?

09:57.054 --> 09:59.307
I almost got taken out.
I don't wanna be next.

09:59.890 --> 10:03.519
Listen, Jeff Colby is hosting a game,
and we need all the real names

10:03.603 --> 10:06.272
-and contacts from your guest list.
-[Keith laughs]

10:06.355 --> 10:09.692
You guys are trying to take a game from me
and want me to help you?

10:09.775 --> 10:11.319
What are you, insane? [scoffs]

10:11.402 --> 10:12.987
Your game is done, Keith.

10:13.154 --> 10:16.157
But if Ada thinks Jeff's taken over,
she's gonna want a cut,

10:16.240 --> 10:17.158
just like she did you.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.035
That's how we lure her in.

10:19.744 --> 10:23.539
Once she's here...
we get the dirt we need to take her down.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.838
Your voicemail cut me off, Thurston.
This is Blake again.

10:30.921 --> 10:33.341
So, whenever the hell you decide
to call me back,

10:33.424 --> 10:34.759
I need the other dealer's number--

10:34.842 --> 10:37.303
[automated voice] <i>If you're satisfied</i>
<i>with your message,</i>

10:37.386 --> 10:38.346
<i>press pound or hang up.</i>

10:40.306 --> 10:43.184
I'm looking for the Blake
I played croquet with yesterday.

10:43.267 --> 10:44.977
Any idea when he's coming back?

10:45.061 --> 10:47.605
Yesterday his ex wasn't defending
his wife's killer

10:47.688 --> 10:49.482
and justice wasn't slipping through his--

10:50.441 --> 10:51.275
Through my fingers.

10:51.359 --> 10:54.070
You say you want justice.
Sounds like you want revenge.

10:54.153 --> 10:57.114
I want Hank to pay.
I wanna confront him before the cops do.

10:57.198 --> 11:01.661
But taking this into your own hands
will only create more toxic energy.

11:01.744 --> 11:04.121
You don't need it,
and I refuse to be around it.

11:06.332 --> 11:09.293
-Do you consider yourself a control freak?
-I wouldn't use "freak."

11:09.377 --> 11:10.753
I wouldn't rule it out.

11:11.212 --> 11:12.838
You are the king of an empire.

11:16.926 --> 11:17.760
Was.

11:17.843 --> 11:21.430
Maybe you got used to the control,
but you can't control how people act.

11:21.889 --> 11:27.103
Not Hank, not Alexis, not anyone.
You can only control how you react.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.397
We all want inner peace, Blake.

11:30.898 --> 11:32.608
But you have to open your heart...

11:33.984 --> 11:34.985
and let me in.

11:37.905 --> 11:40.658
I need you to intercept that Rembrandt.

11:40.741 --> 11:43.244
There's a reason I went with Blake
in the divorce.

11:43.494 --> 11:46.705
He's my most important client.
I can't keep ignoring his calls.

11:46.997 --> 11:50.793
Might I remind you that
that Rembrandt is a forgery,

11:50.876 --> 11:53.337
one of many you sold to Blake
throughout the years

11:53.421 --> 11:56.340
to pay for your vacation home in Nice.

11:57.675 --> 12:00.636
I recall our little arrangement
benefited you also.

12:00.719 --> 12:02.596
A few unsanctioned shopping sprees,

12:02.680 --> 12:06.142
some elective surgeries here and there.
And there.

12:06.892 --> 12:10.938
If this comes out,
my reputation can't fall any further...

12:11.564 --> 12:13.482
but yours, in the art world?

12:13.899 --> 12:15.359
They're always looking for someone

12:15.443 --> 12:18.404
to hawk prints of <i>Dogs Playing Poker</i>
at the flea market.

12:18.821 --> 12:22.533
Pay off the seller, get the painting back,
and leave the past in the past.

12:22.616 --> 12:24.201
We'll all sleep much better.

12:26.495 --> 12:29.665
Oh, and by the way,
this isn't one of your forgeries.

12:29.748 --> 12:32.168
This is a masterpiece.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.589
These past few months
have been chaotic at best,

12:36.672 --> 12:40.342
but me hosting these dinners is my way
to try to reestablish normalcy.

12:40.426 --> 12:43.345
I would never have done any of this
if it weren't for Steven.

12:43.429 --> 12:47.183
I certainly wouldn't have invited Mother,
who graced us by not showing up.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.934
So, cheers to family.

12:49.018 --> 12:52.396
I think that was beautiful, Fallon,
and that's exactly the kind of healing

12:52.480 --> 12:54.148
-this family needs.
-[cell phone buzzes]

12:54.231 --> 12:56.150
[Fallon] I'm sorry, who is she, again?

12:56.233 --> 13:00.154
Save your cheesy inspirational quotes
for Instagram, and don't tag me.

13:01.655 --> 13:04.158
-I gotta go.
-Seriously? You're gonna leave me

13:04.241 --> 13:06.452
in this family-run torture chamber
by myself?

13:06.535 --> 13:09.455
Big-brother duty.
Evie's got some millennial drama.

13:09.955 --> 13:10.831
I'm sorry.

13:13.542 --> 13:15.544
Well, I guess we have an extra seat.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.714
Perfect, because thanks
to some inspiration from Cristal,

13:19.048 --> 13:22.009
I flew in a very special guest
all the way from Paris

13:22.092 --> 13:25.095
who is gonna tell us
what the future holds for this family.

13:25.179 --> 13:29.600
Please welcome... Adriana the psychic.

13:29.683 --> 13:32.561
-Adriana.
-You used the jet for this?

13:32.645 --> 13:33.687
Hi, I'm Cristal.

13:33.771 --> 13:36.607
Don't you know we have plenty
of homegrown scam artists

13:36.690 --> 13:37.650
right here in Georgia?

13:38.275 --> 13:40.277
Don't tell me,
you knew I was gonna say that.

13:40.778 --> 13:41.820
I did.

13:42.196 --> 13:46.825
Adriana's given me readings over the phone
that have literally changed my life.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.619
And you wonder
why poor people aren't rich.

13:48.702 --> 13:50.996
[Adriana] If you keep your hearts
and minds open,

13:51.080 --> 13:54.667
I can connect you with the past,
present and future through my cards.

13:54.750 --> 13:57.795
They give me guidance on the fates
of everyone in this room.

13:58.254 --> 13:59.129
Including you.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.299
-This is so exciting.
-Sam, really?

14:02.383 --> 14:04.843
Sorry I'm late. I, uh-- Oh.

14:05.970 --> 14:08.138
What sort of dinner is this, Fallon?

14:08.222 --> 14:12.977
Ah. The matriarch, exiled, unwelcome.

14:13.644 --> 14:16.397
Join us. The circle must be complete.

14:16.855 --> 14:18.899
I'd like to see credentials.

14:19.233 --> 14:22.236
She's a con artist, Mother.
You two speak the same language.

14:28.701 --> 14:32.496
The cards are a map of your lives.
They answer all questions.

14:32.580 --> 14:35.833
Like how long we're fated to sit here?
Dinner's getting cold.

14:35.916 --> 14:38.002
-Shh.
-For you.

14:39.336 --> 14:40.546
Love, passion.

14:41.046 --> 14:43.215
Oh, you noticed my engagement ring.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.176
Wow, your psychic ability knows no bounds.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.178
A man, strong, bare-chested.

14:49.013 --> 14:51.807
Are you sure that's not my card?
'Cause that could be Steven.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.643
Get your own card. Go on.

14:57.605 --> 14:58.689
A warning.

14:59.648 --> 15:02.693
A powerful betrayal
around this bare-chested man.

15:03.068 --> 15:07.656
Only the ultimate kiss
will tell you whose love is true.

15:08.949 --> 15:12.995
Sorry, Sam, the only thing in the cards
for me tonight is some Netflix and chill.

15:13.078 --> 15:14.413
Try not to wake the dead.

15:14.496 --> 15:15.998
Okay, do me.

15:16.790 --> 15:19.877
Now, remember who's paying your fees,
so, give me a good one.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.004
[Adriana] For you, Sam.

15:23.005 --> 15:25.299
This card means the promise of growth.

15:26.467 --> 15:30.012
-I'm not getting fat, am I?
-Growth, as in new life.

15:32.556 --> 15:34.516
And this same card points to you.

15:36.101 --> 15:39.396
You have a grand role to play
in his journey.

15:40.439 --> 15:42.858
I do have his dry cleaning picked up
for him every week.

15:43.567 --> 15:44.610
New life?

15:46.403 --> 15:49.114
I hope you got the answers
you were looking for, Sam.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.491
Oh, no, no, no, I'm good.

15:50.783 --> 15:56.080
The nine of swords. Such loss.
A wife, a son. Two sons.

15:56.372 --> 15:57.331
She's right.

15:58.749 --> 16:01.085
Just means
that she reads the newspaper, dear.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.545
Not exactly Nostradamus.

16:04.797 --> 16:08.217
Blake, don't be afraid.
Trust me, this can be really good for you.

16:09.259 --> 16:10.094
Go on, Adriana.

16:13.472 --> 16:16.767
[Adriana] Three of swords.
Grief, guilt and now confusion.

16:16.850 --> 16:19.478
-This is not necessary.
-But look, a path forward.

16:19.561 --> 16:21.480
The dead knows what's in your heart.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.315
She's talking about Celia.

16:24.233 --> 16:28.112
And finally, there is peace,
forgiveness, a new chapter.

16:31.323 --> 16:33.909
-I don't know what to say.
-You don't have to say anything.

16:33.993 --> 16:37.663
All the guilt, all the pain
you've been feeling, you can let it go.

16:38.747 --> 16:40.749
Yes, let it go...

16:41.333 --> 16:44.878
and you, too,
can fall for these parlor tricks.

16:45.254 --> 16:48.215
I mean, clearly, this Cristal 2.0

16:48.298 --> 16:51.593
has told the snake-oil peddler
our family business

16:51.677 --> 16:55.180
so that she can sink her hooks
into you even deeper.

16:57.975 --> 17:00.144
Well, I don't wanna...

17:00.227 --> 17:01.562
But wait, there's more.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.022
Five of cups.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.318
A hooded figure, a past mistake,

17:08.402 --> 17:11.530
deeply regretted,
returns back to haunt you.

17:11.613 --> 17:13.741
He's a danger to you.

17:15.617 --> 17:16.785
To all Carringtons.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.460
[dishes shatter]

17:26.252 --> 17:27.296
[sighs]

17:27.378 --> 17:29.840
-[chuckles]
-Bo's right. Let's eat, shall we?

17:32.676 --> 17:36.305
-Hey. Wanna grab a bite?
-Rain check. I got a lot going on.

17:36.388 --> 17:38.307
Oh, yeah, I see that. [chuckles]

17:38.849 --> 17:40.392
These are nice poker tables.

17:40.476 --> 17:43.979
I may or may not have run
a strip-poker game back in high school.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.733
-Just hosting a few friends.
-A few of your billionaire friends?

17:47.816 --> 17:50.069
-When do we start?
-Not sure you can afford the buy-in.

17:51.779 --> 17:54.323
I don't want a seat at the table.
I need a job.

17:54.406 --> 17:57.242
And I know how
these underground poker games work.

17:57.701 --> 18:01.371
I wear a tight skirt, keep the alcohol
flowing for you and your friends.

18:01.455 --> 18:04.750
The last time you tried working here,
you made headlines on TMZ.

18:04.833 --> 18:08.545
Look, my bills are stacking up,
and any tips I could score

18:08.629 --> 18:11.256
from these rich Americans
would really help me out.

18:12.758 --> 18:13.759
Pretty please?

18:20.557 --> 18:24.645
There you are,
my strong, bare-chested fiancé.

18:24.728 --> 18:27.523
-I thought we'd grab some we-time.
-I'm about to shower.

18:27.606 --> 18:30.651
-I'm short on time.
-Well, maybe I'll join you.

18:33.070 --> 18:36.573
Hey. You're not upset
that Liam was in the office, right?

18:36.657 --> 18:38.158
I needed him to do transition work.

18:38.242 --> 18:41.537
-No, but about that divorce party--
-You're not weaseling out of it.

18:41.620 --> 18:44.248
Liam wants to do
some sort of untying-the-knot thing.

18:44.331 --> 18:45.374
I chose you to cut it.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.085
I'm sure you two can handle it.

18:48.418 --> 18:51.588
Well, if you won't go for me,
maybe you'll go for Jim Clark.

18:52.297 --> 18:53.257
Who is Jim Clark?

18:53.340 --> 18:55.592
A bigwig over at Aston Martin
here in Atlanta.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.719
I arranged for you to meet at the party.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.807
Fine. I will be there. And thank you.

19:03.559 --> 19:08.438
But, you know, I'd rather not host
the whole Liam-party thing here,

19:08.522 --> 19:10.691
where we live,
downstairs from our bedroom.

19:10.774 --> 19:14.319
So, why not move it to the Colbys' club?

19:14.403 --> 19:17.072
Monica isn't exactly my biggest fan
at the moment.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.031
I will talk to her.

19:18.115 --> 19:20.993
You just get the party moved to the club.
I'll take care of the rest.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.709
Alexis, dear, I have good news.

19:28.792 --> 19:29.918
You have the painting,

19:30.002 --> 19:32.337
the seller has the money,
and Blake's none the wiser?

19:33.255 --> 19:35.090
No, no and no.

19:35.382 --> 19:39.052
The seller is bringing the painting,
and Blake is going to apprehend him.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.013
I won't have to spend a dime.

19:41.096 --> 19:43.473
I told you not to pick up the phone.

19:43.974 --> 19:47.352
Blake being involved ruins everything.
It exposes me.

19:47.644 --> 19:50.480
Being exposed was never a problem
for the Alexis I knew.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.566
This is the best-case scenario.

19:52.649 --> 19:56.445
Blake will never trace the forgery to us
or even question its authenticity.

19:56.528 --> 19:58.197
If he gets caught, I promise you,

19:58.280 --> 20:01.283
you will have more luck
getting a Chick-fil-A on Sunday

20:01.366 --> 20:04.203
than you will selling a piece of art
in this town again.

20:04.286 --> 20:07.664
And you'll have better luck convincing
Vidal Sassoon you're a natural blond

20:07.748 --> 20:10.626
than ever getting me
to betray Blake Carrington.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.921
Now get your tired masterpiece
out of my office.

20:17.591 --> 20:18.592
[cell phone buzzing]

20:18.675 --> 20:21.261
Oh, Culhane. Your phone.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.598
It might be Jim Clark.
I gave him your number.

20:30.812 --> 20:32.064
Culhane's phone.

20:32.147 --> 20:34.942
[Ada] <i>I'm looking for Michael. Who's this?</i>

20:36.235 --> 20:38.570
This is his fiancée. Who is this?

20:38.654 --> 20:41.657
<i>Tell him a close friend called.</i>
<i>He'll know who it is.</i>

20:42.032 --> 20:43.116
[line disconnects]

20:47.162 --> 20:48.205
[doorbell rings]

20:48.288 --> 20:53.085
Anders, I figured out Adriana's prediction
about growth and new life.

20:54.378 --> 20:56.630
My baby with Steven.
That's what I'm meant to focus on.

20:57.047 --> 21:00.300
Well, it's always wise
to heed the words of a prognosticator.

21:00.384 --> 21:04.721
I've already spoken to Steven,
and I put out word online for a surrogate.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.139
The response has been insane.

21:06.223 --> 21:08.558
How are you planning
on vetting candidates?

21:09.184 --> 21:11.270
I was hoping you could help,

21:11.353 --> 21:15.649
since she did say
you'd have a grand role... Grandpa.

21:17.901 --> 21:20.112
-Welcome. Welcome.
-[woman] Thank you.

21:20.570 --> 21:21.655
[Sam] Thank you for coming.

21:21.905 --> 21:24.199
What attracted you
to the idea of surrogacy?

21:24.866 --> 21:27.995
My guidance counselor said
that I should stay away from math.

21:28.078 --> 21:29.454
Do you have any questions?

21:29.538 --> 21:30.831
Do I get to live in here?

21:32.416 --> 21:34.793
Have you ever been convicted of a crime?

21:34.876 --> 21:37.087
Convicted? No.

21:37.379 --> 21:39.464
What would you do with the $5 million?

21:40.382 --> 21:41.675
I would do it for free.

21:42.718 --> 21:45.053
As long as I could do it
the old-fashioned way.

21:50.851 --> 21:52.269
[chattering]

21:53.395 --> 21:55.897
Wow. This place looks amazing.

21:55.981 --> 21:58.066
-Don't try to butter me up.
-Oh, come on.

21:58.150 --> 22:01.278
I'm sorry crazy Kirby picked a fight
with me at your opening,

22:01.361 --> 22:03.322
but we both know it got you more buzz.

22:03.405 --> 22:05.949
Just don't go
ripping people's clothes off tonight.

22:06.408 --> 22:08.577
And congratulations on your engagement.

22:08.660 --> 22:11.079
Although I guess
you have to get divorced first.

22:11.663 --> 22:13.415
You just don't do normal, do you?

22:14.416 --> 22:15.709
I would kill for normal.

22:17.878 --> 22:20.047
-I think he's cheating on me.
-Culhane?

22:21.673 --> 22:24.259
-Why? Did you ask him?
-Call it a premonition.

22:24.676 --> 22:27.346
Anyway, I just need your support tonight.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.097
Will you be my maid of dishonor?

22:29.181 --> 22:32.184
If that means I'm responsible
for getting us shots, I'm in.

22:34.144 --> 22:36.063
Fallon. Hi.

22:36.146 --> 22:38.899
My lovely soon-to-be ex.
Meet Craig Thompson,

22:39.524 --> 22:41.568
one of Van Kirk Industries'
major shareholders.

22:41.902 --> 22:44.863
Craig's always had
a love-hate relationship with my family.

22:44.946 --> 22:46.573
He could've predicted
you'd get sick of us.

22:46.656 --> 22:48.366
-[laughs]
-But as you can see,

22:48.450 --> 22:52.204
we are still making happily-ever-after
work on the business front.

22:53.163 --> 22:55.999
-Yes, yes, we are.
-I have to say that I'm relieved.

22:56.083 --> 22:58.001
If you're gonna head this transition--

22:58.085 --> 23:00.879
You know, I'm so sorry. Excuse me one sec.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.679
Looks like Liam's having the night
of his life.

23:09.763 --> 23:12.474
When you were in the shower,
some woman called.

23:12.557 --> 23:14.684
She didn't leave her name,
but she sounded familiar.

23:15.393 --> 23:17.896
That's weird,
but you know how solicitors are now.

23:18.522 --> 23:19.815
I don't think it was a solicitor.

23:21.274 --> 23:24.736
-Is there something you need to tell me?
-Of course not.

23:24.820 --> 23:27.739
Maybe you're projecting
'cause it's your divorce party.

23:27.823 --> 23:29.616
Or maybe the psychic was right.

23:29.699 --> 23:32.994
-[cell phone buzzing]
-Psychic? Fallon? Seriously?

23:34.830 --> 23:38.333
Isn't there like a bouquet
you need to re-catch or something?

23:40.460 --> 23:43.880
Don't go far. Jim Clark from Aston Martin
should be here any second.

23:43.964 --> 23:46.383
Okay, well,
tell Jim to wait for me by the bar.

23:54.182 --> 23:55.433

[Culhane clears throat]

24:09.489 --> 24:11.992
-How's Fallon?
-More suspicious than I'd like.

24:12.075 --> 24:14.536
Hopefully, I can show my face enough
to keep her calm.

24:15.370 --> 24:17.038
-And Ada?
-Just tried her again.

24:17.122 --> 24:20.125
-I can't get her on the phone.
-The plan may not be working?

Oh. Actually, I think I'm already here.

24:40.103 --> 24:41.897
Jeff Colby, Ada Stone.

24:42.480 --> 24:45.817
Mr. Colby, I heard you were flashy.
Your outfit doesn't disappoint.

24:45.901 --> 24:49.529
I imagine there will be books written
on your levels of conspicuous consumption.

24:49.779 --> 24:51.740
Well, if you got it, flaunt it, right?

24:51.823 --> 24:54.743
Well, our interpretations
of that phrase may vary, but...

24:54.826 --> 24:58.288
-we do have business to discuss.
-I'm always looking for new opportunities.

24:58.371 --> 25:00.373

Well, I was desperate. I have nothing.

And I thought that, well,
nobody would miss the painting, so, I--

26:06.273 --> 26:07.732
So, I borrowed it.

26:08.108 --> 26:11.111
Then why did the gallerist's description
fit Hank to a T?

26:12.821 --> 26:15.657
Well, the guy I hired did look similar.

26:15.740 --> 26:18.118
It's stupid on my part, I admit.

26:18.868 --> 26:21.997
That's why I wanted to discourage you
from pursuing the thief.

26:22.247 --> 26:23.832
Look, I am so sorry, Blake.

If you intend on keeping your game going,
I expect a proper payout.

Well, unfortunately, I can't think
of any percentage of <i>my</i> game,

besides zero, that I'm willing to give up.

Mr. Colby, you remember the man
who ran the last game, Keith? He's out of business and facing
a very unfortunate accident as we speak.

And I actually liked him.

were in his possession.

-Forty percent. That's my cut of the game.

or possibly don't understand?

28:59.738 --> 29:01.281
No, I understand,

29:01.364 --> 29:04.743
but the funny part is, with all
your posturing and pretentiousness,

29:04.826 --> 29:07.203
you just confessed to extortion,
racketeering,

29:07.287 --> 29:09.414
and probably two or three other felonies.

29:10.081 --> 29:12.459
Have you been deputized
as officers of the law?

29:12.542 --> 29:16.171
No, but with what you just said,
we do have enough evidence

29:16.254 --> 29:18.214
for them to make a case against you.

29:18.298 --> 29:19.966
But it's your word against mine.

you could out-gangster a gangster.

on her with this video.

29:53.625 --> 29:56.085
Unfortunately,
the only footage left on here

29:56.169 --> 29:58.797
is you checking players
into an illegal poker game.

to a man's heart

30:27.242 --> 30:28.993
isn't only through the hole in his boxers.

30:29.452 --> 30:33.581
I should really give Blake more credit
for dealing with you for all these years.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.708
He's more of a saint than I thought.

30:35.792 --> 30:39.170
And you are more of a gold digger
than I imagined.

30:39.254 --> 30:42.715

but if you haven't noticed,

30:42.799 --> 30:44.759

and be his friend.

Not everyone has an agenda.

30:50.181 --> 30:52.016
Then why didn't you tell him
you lost your job?

30:52.725 --> 30:55.019
That's right, I did some digging on you,

30:55.395 --> 30:59.148

hippie-dippie cult-leader I suspected.

30:59.232 --> 31:03.194
You're just a rub-and-tug specialist
whose clinic closed last week.

Just around the same time
that you showed up here again.

-We'll see

if your good friend Blake agrees.

I leaked that picture of you and Culhane
to put you guys on ice.

32:00.084 --> 32:01.878
But you came up with all of this.

32:02.462 --> 32:03.588
You are too clever.

And that's why I love you.

to take pictures.

People ask me how on earth
I could divorce...

32:29.781 --> 32:30.782
this woman.

32:31.407 --> 32:34.452
Well... let me count the ways.

32:34.953 --> 32:39.457
The only thing greater than her IQ
is her hat collection.

32:40.208 --> 32:43.127
I hate how she reads the last page
of a book first

32:43.211 --> 32:44.879
and then spoils it for me...

32:45.672 --> 32:49.342
yet she's never bothered
to read a word I've written.

32:49.884 --> 32:50.885

32:53.638 --> 32:55.765
I hate how I can smell her perfume
on my clothes

32:56.224 --> 32:58.059
after she's been gone for hours.

32:58.518 --> 33:02.271
I hate how she's a million times smarter
than I am, and she's never wrong.

33:03.982 --> 33:06.776
Most of all, I hate that I'll never
have chemistry with anyone else

33:06.859 --> 33:08.069
like I have with her.

33:10.488 --> 33:13.533
But fate is fate.
Who are we to stop it, right?

33:19.956 --> 33:21.708
It's been real, Fallon.

33:23.793 --> 33:24.836
At least for me.

33:28.423 --> 33:31.718
Wow. That was... rude yet beautiful.

by these scissors...

-It was a mistake.

-I'm with Culhane.
-Is that what your heart is saying?

-We're engaged.
-So?

34:26.438 --> 34:27.440
Where is he?

34:39.911 --> 34:42.330
You've been very, very naughty.

34:43.706 --> 34:46.333
And surely you know
I'm gonna punish you for it.

34:46.876 --> 34:48.543
[moans]

34:49.087 --> 34:50.838
[Fallon] Wait. Wait.

34:51.755 --> 34:52.965
Wait, wait, wait.

34:57.303 --> 34:58.805
Who the hell is that?

35:01.891 --> 35:05.937
That damn psychic was right.
She told me Culhane would betray me.

35:07.647 --> 35:08.481
Oh, my God.

35:09.649 --> 35:12.860
But you're the strong, bare-chested...

35:12.944 --> 35:13.820
[gasps]

35:13.903 --> 35:18.157
And I kissed... [gasps] No, no, no.

35:18.241 --> 35:21.410
I had it all backwards.
I had it all backwards. I betrayed him.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.330
No, no. Fallon, it's okay.

35:24.872 --> 35:27.208
You need to go.
You need to get away from here.

35:28.543 --> 35:30.253
Okay.

35:30.962 --> 35:31.838
Uh...

35:32.338 --> 35:35.591
-I just need to grab my disc.
-Excuse me.

35:36.592 --> 35:40.638
Jeff, I know what that looks like,
but I promise you that it's...

35:41.681 --> 35:42.557
[sighs]

35:42.640 --> 35:43.599
Forget it.

35:43.975 --> 35:47.603
Just don't tell Culhane, please,
because I just, I got a little too drunk

35:47.687 --> 35:50.523
and a little too mad,
and it added up to a big mistake.

35:50.982 --> 35:52.066
I won't say anything.

35:52.150 --> 35:54.485
But only because
you need to tell him yourself.

35:55.027 --> 35:58.072
Well, I should, but I think
he's having an affair, too, so...

35:58.156 --> 35:59.740
Well, not-- Not "too."

35:59.824 --> 36:01.826
Fallon, Culhane is doing right by you.

36:03.578 --> 36:05.621
More right than what was happening here.

36:09.917 --> 36:11.127
[sighs]

36:12.211 --> 36:13.254
Fifty bucks.

36:14.005 --> 36:16.591
I worked my ass off
for the richest bastards in Atlanta,

36:16.674 --> 36:18.050
and all I got was 50 bucks.

36:18.134 --> 36:20.678
It's enough to buy
your brother-in-law a drink,

36:20.761 --> 36:23.556
and the least you could do
after ruining my baby shower.

36:23.639 --> 36:26.684
-Not that it was your baby to shower.
-And it may never be.

36:26.767 --> 36:27.685
Ooh.

36:28.352 --> 36:29.353
That sounds ominous.

36:30.730 --> 36:32.565
A psychic predicted I'd have a baby,

36:32.648 --> 36:34.942
but it looks like
it's not gonna come true.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.444
Does the psychic know you're a dude?

36:38.905 --> 36:40.615
We were going to use a surrogate.

36:40.698 --> 36:43.826
I was hoping finding one
would get Steven home sooner,

36:43.910 --> 36:45.244
but they were all trash.

36:45.328 --> 36:47.038
Maybe your standards are too high.

36:47.538 --> 36:50.041
Well, yeah. My standard is Steven.

36:50.124 --> 36:51.709
His smile, his sweetness.

36:51.792 --> 36:53.544
Even if the mom were just tall,

36:53.628 --> 36:56.172
so the kid would feel
like both of ours, you know?

36:56.255 --> 36:59.300
Yeah. And more than looks.
I mean, Steven's kind.

36:59.926 --> 37:04.472
Well, he was the nicest Carrington to me.
That was before he knew he was my brother.

37:07.683 --> 37:08.601
Maybe it's you.

37:10.186 --> 37:11.979
-What's me?
-The perfect surrogate.

37:12.563 --> 37:16.609
You're Steven's half sister.
It'll practically be like a little Steven.

37:20.529 --> 37:22.365
How much did you say it paid, again?

37:32.166 --> 37:33.042
[sighs]

37:35.336 --> 37:38.464
-We need to talk about your ex-wife.
-Yes, we do.

37:38.839 --> 37:41.759
I just had what could have been
a stroke-inducing throwdown with her,

37:41.842 --> 37:43.135
but thanks to you,

37:43.511 --> 37:47.848
for the first time in 40 years,
Alexis didn't get under my skin.

37:48.891 --> 37:50.851
I wish I could say the same.

37:50.935 --> 37:53.896
Practice what you preach.
You're showing me how to be real.

37:53.980 --> 37:55.147
It's changing my life.

37:55.606 --> 37:57.066
I'm happy for that, Blake.

37:58.609 --> 38:01.320
But I haven't exactly been real with you.

38:03.197 --> 38:05.491
I lost my job in Arizona a week ago.

38:05.574 --> 38:08.953
Yeah, Alexis told me that.
Was it because you were here for me?

38:10.121 --> 38:11.289
They closed the clinic.

38:11.872 --> 38:13.958
I stayed for you. I mean, I--

38:14.208 --> 38:17.378
I wanted to, but the truth is...

38:18.129 --> 38:19.588
I had nowhere else to go.

38:20.006 --> 38:21.424
I'm sorry you lost your job.

38:22.883 --> 38:25.386
-You're not angry that I lied?
-How could I be?

38:25.803 --> 38:26.721
It was fate.

38:26.804 --> 38:29.932
You have nowhere else to be
because this is where you belong.

38:32.310 --> 38:35.313
Oh. I guess that Zen thing is working out.

38:35.396 --> 38:36.480
I guess so.

38:45.281 --> 38:47.158
I know my destiny when I see it.

39:03.591 --> 39:04.425
Your cut.

39:09.055 --> 39:10.556
Don't be discouraged.

39:10.639 --> 39:13.851
Keith screwed you because doing so
would prove his loyalty to me.

39:14.143 --> 39:17.605
So, like the prodigal son,
I welcomed him back to the fold.

39:18.189 --> 39:20.232
And until I'm certain of your loyalty,

39:20.316 --> 39:22.943
that recording of Jeff
running an illegal card game

39:23.027 --> 39:26.572
in his innocent sister's club
is my insurance you'll behave.

39:27.073 --> 39:28.449
Leave Monica out of this.

39:28.532 --> 39:30.868
I'm not the one
who put her club in my sights.

39:30.951 --> 39:33.662
Oh, and what a pretty club it is, too.

39:34.205 --> 39:36.457
It should make me an even prettier penny.

39:39.835 --> 39:42.588
Tell me,
how did you know about the hooded figure?

39:43.798 --> 39:45.466
It was so specific.

39:45.758 --> 39:47.843
I only know what the fates reveal.

39:48.260 --> 39:49.804
And I want to know more.

39:54.475 --> 39:55.684
[chuckles]

39:55.768 --> 39:59.105
I like this.
The two of cups over the six of cups.

39:59.480 --> 40:02.233
-I like this very much.
-And why do you like it?

40:02.441 --> 40:04.777
A man, an old friend.

40:04.860 --> 40:08.447
Well, he's more than that.
He's my ex-husband.

40:08.531 --> 40:11.534
I see here you still want him very much.

40:12.326 --> 40:14.161
Yes. Go on.

40:14.245 --> 40:17.498
He, too, is full of passion,

40:17.581 --> 40:19.834
but... no fulfillment.

40:19.917 --> 40:21.210
Is that possible?

40:21.502 --> 40:24.964
Well, we did share passion,
if that's what you mean.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.550
Actually not that long ago.

40:28.676 --> 40:30.803
Tell me about the future. What do you see?

40:30.886 --> 40:32.972
-Deceit.
-What kind of deceit?

40:33.055 --> 40:36.267
A man, very frightened, very stupid.

40:36.559 --> 40:37.893
Could be worse, right?

40:37.977 --> 40:41.313
Blake could've caught me.
Who knows what he would have done?

40:41.397 --> 40:43.524
-Thank God Alexis warned me.
-[crying]

40:43.607 --> 40:47.278
Oh. I know just what your mother
would say, that I'm an idiot

40:47.361 --> 40:49.738
and Alexis was protecting herself, not me.

40:50.197 --> 40:53.075
-[baby crying]
-What could I do, Matthew?

40:57.955 --> 40:59.081
[door opens]

40:59.165 --> 41:01.333
[woman] Get that filthy finger
out of his mouth.

41:01.417 --> 41:03.836
-I'm sorry, Claudia.
-Where's the money?

41:05.004 --> 41:06.005
And the painting? Idiot.

41:09.383 --> 41:11.844
I gave you three shots
to get that money your way.

41:12.303 --> 41:14.096
Now it's my turn.

41:15.264 --> 41:17.183
Can you go back to the cards?
I prefer them.

41:18.684 --> 41:23.105
Queen of cups. See? Very wise, very calm,

41:23.481 --> 41:26.901
very... sensitive woman,

41:26.984 --> 41:29.820
very connected to this man.

41:30.321 --> 41:33.115
Think she would've stayed if I hadn't
bought her clinic and shut it down?

41:33.866 --> 41:35.242
Why worry? It's done.

41:36.076 --> 41:37.953
I suppose all's well that ends well.

41:39.121 --> 41:41.665
Particularly if you have the money
to write your own ending.

41:42.750 --> 41:46.962
So, tell me more about this powerful man
who is very attracted to me,

41:47.713 --> 41:49.423
who may or may not be Blake.

41:50.925 --> 41:52.843
[Adriana] He's going to ask you
to marry him.

41:53.385 --> 41:54.595
-And will I?
-Yes.

41:55.095 --> 41:57.014
-Only...
-Only what?

41:57.097 --> 41:58.516
<i>♪ Why do I always... ♪</i>

41:59.016 --> 42:00.184
He will expire.

42:00.684 --> 42:03.103
-What do you mean, expire?
-He will expire...

42:03.771 --> 42:04.939
<i>♪ Wait till ♪</i>

42:05.022 --> 42:06.524
like death.
