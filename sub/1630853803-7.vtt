WEBVTT

00:10.928 --> 00:13.514
<i>I believe I owe you an apology.</i>

00:14.181 --> 00:18.060
For sharing information
that you weren't quite ready to process.

00:18.143 --> 00:19.186
About your mother.

00:19.937 --> 00:22.648
- About your history.
- I'm the one who should be sorry.

00:24.399 --> 00:25.692
For not listening.

00:26.193 --> 00:29.488
For refusing to accept that everyone
around me was just trying to help

00:29.571 --> 00:31.532
when, clearly, I'm the problem.

00:33.575 --> 00:34.993
Did something happen?

00:39.248 --> 00:40.791
What happened is,

00:42.417 --> 00:45.671
I woke up in the middle of an explosion,

00:47.381 --> 00:50.551
then found out I'm the bomb.

00:52.219 --> 00:53.428
Why do you say that?

00:55.013 --> 00:58.934
What I did hurt everyone around me.

01:00.978 --> 01:02.312
What did you do?

01:11.113 --> 01:12.114
I jumped.

01:14.241 --> 01:16.410
That's the only thing I know for sure.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.918
And why do you think it's been so hard
for you to accept that?

01:27.254 --> 01:29.590
Because I guess
I don't recognize that person.

01:30.132 --> 01:34.344
But the minute you stop looking
for other explanations,

01:35.012 --> 01:36.180
maybe you will.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.275
What are we doing out here, Sophie?

03:11.358 --> 03:12.609
Have you given it to anyone?

03:13.569 --> 03:16.071
The evidence… about the transactions,
the bank account.

03:16.154 --> 03:18.740
- Have you shared it with anyone?
- Of course not. No.

03:18.824 --> 03:20.868
All right? I need you with me
to corroborate everything.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.328
Okay.

03:23.412 --> 03:25.080
Sophie, what happened?

03:25.163 --> 03:26.498
Why aren't you talking to me?

03:26.582 --> 03:29.293
I need you to hold off. Just a bit.

03:30.252 --> 03:32.171
But every minute we wait
puts you in more danger.

03:32.254 --> 03:33.714
- I'll be all right.
- You don't know that.

03:33.797 --> 03:34.798
I do.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.886
Can you just tell me
what the hell is going on?

03:41.054 --> 03:42.055
I just found out…

03:47.144 --> 03:49.521
there are other people caught up in this.

03:50.397 --> 03:51.732
Innocent people

03:52.524 --> 03:55.152
who don't deserve to go down
for someone else's mistakes.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.237
People who deserve some time
to get ahead of this.

03:57.321 --> 03:58.947
My loyalty is to you, Sophie.

03:59.448 --> 04:01.617
Making sure you're safe.
I don't give a fuck about other people.

04:01.700 --> 04:02.993
Just give me some time.

04:03.994 --> 04:06.747
This is not just about James. Not anymore.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.458
Does he know you're here?

04:14.588 --> 04:15.589
Twenty-four hours.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.882
I'm trusting you on this one, okay?

04:18.382 --> 04:19.384
Thank you.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.223
I don't get this at all.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.975
Twenty-four hours.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.269
That's it.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.414
Victoria emailed.

04:52.084 --> 04:55.420
SFPD's Financial Crimes Unit
wants to interview me.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.714
Apparently, someone tipped them off

04:57.798 --> 04:59.883
to the internal investigation
at Ascendant.

05:01.677 --> 05:02.678
What are we gonna do?

05:06.348 --> 05:08.100
For starters,
you're gonna go to that bank,

05:08.183 --> 05:09.601
and you're gonna empty that account.

05:10.102 --> 05:11.436
Money trail's a lot less damning

05:11.520 --> 05:14.189
than a bank account
full of misappropriated funds.

05:14.273 --> 05:15.357
What does the firm know?

05:15.440 --> 05:19.319
Not much. I took out some loans
and paid 'em back.

05:19.403 --> 05:20.779
- Loans?
- Yeah.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.490
You borrowed $11 million?

05:23.574 --> 05:24.825
Yeah.

05:24.908 --> 05:26.702
- From whom?
- Mortgaged the house.

05:26.785 --> 05:29.413
Harrison made some deals.
Caroline cut a check.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.834
Yeah, I'll go to the bank,

05:33.917 --> 05:35.794
but I don't know if that will work.

05:35.878 --> 05:36.879
What else?

05:36.962 --> 05:39.548
Just act normal
and go to your appointments.

05:40.257 --> 05:43.385
Keep up appearances.
Let me find out just how exposed we are.

05:45.596 --> 05:48.182
Does this meeting have
anything to do with a cop

05:48.265 --> 05:49.683
who was in our driveway yesterday?

05:52.227 --> 05:53.937
Is he the one who tipped off FCU?

05:56.148 --> 05:57.149
You know who he is?

05:59.484 --> 06:01.111
Yeah, I got a pretty good idea.

06:07.743 --> 06:08.952
He approached me

06:10.454 --> 06:11.538
after the accident.

06:13.498 --> 06:17.794
I didn't know
who we'd… been to one another.

06:17.878 --> 06:18.921
That's enough. That's--

06:19.880 --> 06:20.881
That's enough.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.551
He was suspicious of you
from the beginning.

06:26.386 --> 06:30.599
He knew about Portland.
That your alibi was a lie.

06:30.682 --> 06:32.601
Alibi? What the fuck?

06:41.360 --> 06:43.195
Hey, look, we're…

06:46.740 --> 06:47.824
We're gonna be okay.

06:49.743 --> 06:50.744
All right?

06:51.703 --> 06:52.704
I believe that.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.086
How much does he know?

07:06.134 --> 07:07.302
Whose phone is that?

07:09.137 --> 07:10.264
It's mine.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.725
<i>Hi, it's me. I have it.</i>

07:13.809 --> 07:16.645
<i>Shelled the money into offshore accounts,
just like I said he would.</i>

07:16.728 --> 07:17.896
<i>Everything was tracked.</i>

07:17.980 --> 07:20.732
<i>He mapped the whole thing out,
including the last action.</i>

07:20.816 --> 07:24.736
<i>The day before your accident,
3.1 million to a bank downtown.</i>

07:25.445 --> 07:28.115
<i>The money is in an account
under the name Tess Caldwell.</i>

07:29.241 --> 07:30.576
<i>Has to be him.</i>

07:31.660 --> 07:32.661
<i>Who else could it be?</i>

07:43.714 --> 07:44.840
Tess Caldwell?

07:48.343 --> 07:49.344
Yes.

07:49.428 --> 07:51.263
How can I help you today, Miss Caldwell?

07:51.763 --> 07:54.975
I'm looking to access
some funds in my account.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.560
Of course, no problem.

08:00.355 --> 08:01.523
Have a seat.

08:04.151 --> 08:07.779
I'm not exactly sure
how to say this, but…

08:09.823 --> 08:13.535
I was recently the victim
of a pretty violent home invasion.

08:14.119 --> 08:15.746
Oh, no. I'm sorry to hear that.

08:16.246 --> 08:19.666
Thank you. My passport
and all my ID's were stolen.

08:19.750 --> 08:22.461
They pretty much cleaned out
the whole house.

08:23.504 --> 08:29.218
And unfortunately, I need access
to the funds in this account immediately,

08:29.301 --> 08:33.096
because of a business opportunity
that demands I move it right away.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.933
With partners who aren't nearly
as understanding as you.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.686
And how much were you hoping to withdraw?

08:40.645 --> 08:41.772
3.1 million.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.399
You want to drain the account?

08:46.109 --> 08:48.737
Well, the only way you can do that
is with a passport.

08:48.820 --> 08:51.156
Which won't be replaced for several weeks.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.867
At which point my partners
will have moved on.

08:55.619 --> 08:57.246
There's really nothing you can do?

08:57.329 --> 09:01.166
Well, if you correctly answer
a series of security questions,

09:01.250 --> 09:04.628
we could grant temporary access
to a percentage of the funds.

09:04.711 --> 09:05.712
Security questions?

09:05.796 --> 09:06.797
Personal information.

09:07.297 --> 09:08.507
Your past.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.717
Seems like it'd be worth a try.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.848
You know, maybe I should come back
another time when I'm not so worked up.

09:15.931 --> 09:16.932
You know,

09:17.724 --> 09:21.228
under normal circumstances
with this kind of request,

09:21.311 --> 09:24.147
I'd need to flag your account
for review by the authorities.

09:25.023 --> 09:26.191
Really?

09:26.275 --> 09:28.694
Your customers
never have their ID's stolen?

09:28.777 --> 09:32.322
Not right before
they try to withdraw $3 million.

09:35.117 --> 09:36.410
Sure, go ahead.

09:37.411 --> 09:38.537
Okay.

09:38.620 --> 09:39.705
"Question one.

09:39.788 --> 09:42.666
What was the name of the street
you lived on in June of 2003?

09:42.749 --> 09:46.461
Crow Street, Upton Row,
Trowbridge Lane, Fisher Court?"

09:49.965 --> 09:50.966
Fisher Court.

09:58.390 --> 10:00.809
If you'll give me a minute, Miss Caldwell,

10:00.893 --> 10:03.103
I just have to check something
with my supervisor.

10:23.373 --> 10:24.374
Fuck.

10:32.633 --> 10:33.926
Yo.

10:35.469 --> 10:38.472
Did something just crawl up your ass
and die?

10:40.974 --> 10:42.476
In a manner of speaking.

10:46.688 --> 10:49.107
Okay. What's going on?

10:50.776 --> 10:53.111
Thought we were in the clear.
Money's back.

10:53.612 --> 10:55.197
But the trail's still there.

10:55.948 --> 10:57.741
A cop got access to my computer.

10:59.701 --> 11:01.870
The accounts, wire fraud, everything.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.418
How the fuck did that happen?

11:14.091 --> 11:15.467
Look who I fucking found.

11:17.386 --> 11:18.554
What's going on, guys?

11:18.637 --> 11:21.014
Do you have any fucking idea
how fucking fucked you are right now?

11:21.098 --> 11:23.976
There are political prisoners
who are less fucked than you.

11:24.059 --> 11:25.561
Victoria caught you
going through my files.

11:26.228 --> 11:27.855
No, man. I--

11:27.938 --> 11:30.357
Dude, I was just in there
cleaning up a bit, man.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.651
No, you were talking
to undercover cops about me?

11:33.235 --> 11:34.736
If you even think of lying to us,

11:34.820 --> 11:38.532
you should know that I watch
a ton of fucking drug shows,

11:38.615 --> 11:39.908
so I know how to fuck a guy up.

11:39.992 --> 11:40.993
What the fuck?

11:43.996 --> 11:45.539
I didn't know he was a fucking cop.

11:46.164 --> 11:47.165
Fuck!

11:47.249 --> 11:49.501
It was a party,
and they asked me to bring Molly.

11:49.585 --> 11:51.712
Just as a favor.
I swear to God, it was my first time.

11:51.795 --> 11:52.796
You know what?

11:52.880 --> 11:56.884
As fucked as you are right now,
my situation's a hell of a lot worse.

11:56.967 --> 11:59.386
And if I go down because of you,

11:59.469 --> 12:02.222
I will drag your ass
all the way down with me.

12:02.306 --> 12:03.307
Do you understand?

12:03.390 --> 12:04.474
Yeah. Yeah.

12:04.558 --> 12:08.145
So, I need you to tell me
about every interaction,

12:08.228 --> 12:09.813
every conversation,

12:09.897 --> 12:14.276
anything and everything you know
about an Officer Thomas Baden.

12:14.359 --> 12:17.029
I'm sorry, okay? Seriously, I'm sorry.

12:17.112 --> 12:18.822
I really am, okay?

12:19.823 --> 12:21.033
Am I gonna get fired?

12:44.056 --> 12:45.057
Hi.

12:45.140 --> 12:46.350
Hi.

12:46.433 --> 12:47.559
Here you are.

12:49.019 --> 12:50.812
Thought you might be standing me up.

12:50.896 --> 12:53.273
Sorry. Thank you.

12:54.066 --> 12:55.150
Is everything okay?

12:56.193 --> 12:57.653
Yeah. Yeah, why?

12:59.363 --> 13:00.447
Because…

13:01.823 --> 13:04.868
you know, you were acting
a little bit strange the other night,

13:04.952 --> 13:05.953
and…

13:07.246 --> 13:08.997
I don't know. I guess there's just a--

13:10.332 --> 13:11.542
a part of me that was afraid

13:11.625 --> 13:14.920
that this whole mess was
starting all over again.

13:15.003 --> 13:17.589
Like, history repeating itself, you know?

13:22.511 --> 13:25.514
If it's weird with us
because of the money I lent James,

13:25.597 --> 13:26.598
I…

13:27.933 --> 13:30.769
I just-- I really don't want that
to get between us.

13:30.853 --> 13:33.230
- And I'm sorry if--
- It won't.

13:34.731 --> 13:35.732
It won't.

13:37.276 --> 13:38.277
Then what's going on?

13:44.157 --> 13:46.702
James told me the truth.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.246
Good.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.039
Except it wasn't.

13:52.124 --> 13:53.584
The things I did…

13:56.420 --> 13:58.839
You fell in love with somebody
you weren't supposed to.

13:59.673 --> 14:00.674
You're human.

14:02.843 --> 14:05.637
But how can you be in love
with two people at once?

14:05.721 --> 14:10.058
Doesn't that mean eventually somebody's
going to get eviscerated?

14:10.142 --> 14:12.186
No, not somebody. Everybody.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.024
Did he come back?

14:19.151 --> 14:20.777
The guy you were seeing before?

14:23.113 --> 14:25.782
No, that's all in the past.

14:27.367 --> 14:30.621
You know, none of us knew who he was,
and I sort of wish that I did,

14:30.704 --> 14:33.790
because he's as wrapped up
in this mess as we are.

14:39.630 --> 14:45.010
I'm just struggling
with how to make it right.

14:46.595 --> 14:51.266
Every time I think about it,
I feel helpless,

14:52.142 --> 14:53.977
like I'm right back in that water.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.187
But you're right here.

14:56.021 --> 14:57.731
We're right here to help you.

14:57.814 --> 15:01.026
But that's not fair
when you're the ones I've hurt the most.

15:02.069 --> 15:06.114
When someone tells you they love you,
Soph, believe them.

15:07.533 --> 15:08.784
Let them in.

15:08.867 --> 15:11.036
See, you've tried the other way,
and it doesn't work.

15:11.119 --> 15:12.871
So, try this.

16:15.434 --> 16:16.810
Any luck at the bank?

16:18.854 --> 16:21.648
They wouldn't let me do it,
not without a passport.

16:23.317 --> 16:24.359
What did you find out?

16:25.277 --> 16:26.987
We're even more screwed than we thought.

16:29.656 --> 16:32.326
Guess all that's left to do
is to lawyer up and wait.

16:36.121 --> 16:39.124
Or I could confess.

16:40.918 --> 16:42.586
Tell him who's really responsible.

16:43.337 --> 16:44.755
Convince him to destroy the evidence.

16:44.838 --> 16:47.382
No, he's not going to do that, Soph.
He's a cop.

16:47.466 --> 16:50.594
Everything he's done,
he thought he was protecting me.

16:51.470 --> 16:55.641
If he sees I'm the one he hurts most
by going through with all this--

16:55.724 --> 16:58.101
- I can't let you do that. It's--
- I have to try.

16:58.977 --> 17:00.646
I have to tell him something.

17:06.151 --> 17:07.361
Look, let's…

17:09.613 --> 17:13.157
let's sleep on it, okay?
There's got to be another way.

17:15.202 --> 17:17.663
He's the one
that got us into this fucking mess.

17:18.288 --> 17:19.414
No, I am.

17:23.417 --> 17:25.546
Sophie, just leave it.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.609
You do what you have to do?

17:49.945 --> 17:51.572
We good to go ahead?

17:52.990 --> 17:53.991
Sophie?

17:58.328 --> 17:59.705
All I can say is,

18:00.372 --> 18:06.044
the person I am now in front of you,
that's not the person who did this, okay?

18:11.091 --> 18:14.344
The money in that account
isn't money James stole.

18:16.013 --> 18:19.516
It's money I stole from him, his company.

18:19.600 --> 18:22.561
And all he's been trying to do
this whole time is track it down,

18:23.061 --> 18:24.062
give it back.

18:25.147 --> 18:27.024
He was trying to protect me.

18:33.572 --> 18:34.781
James tell you all this?

18:37.409 --> 18:38.535
You can't trust him.

18:39.036 --> 18:40.495
I've been saying that since the beginning.

18:40.579 --> 18:42.372
However he got you
to walk into that house with him--

18:42.456 --> 18:45.542
- Why can't I trust him?
-'Cause your marriage was fucked up.

18:45.626 --> 18:46.835
No one knows that better than me.

18:46.919 --> 18:48.712
You wake up one day with a clean slate,

18:48.795 --> 18:51.089
and all of a sudden,
he wants to paint some perfect picture.

18:51.173 --> 18:52.424
How could you trust him, Sophie?

19:04.770 --> 19:07.814
Things have been coming back.

19:09.274 --> 19:11.527
My therapist called them
intrusive thoughts,

19:11.610 --> 19:14.780
but now I think they're memories.

19:19.159 --> 19:21.286
For a long time,
I wasn't sure if they were real.

19:21.370 --> 19:23.205
But then I heard your message, and I knew.

19:23.956 --> 19:25.832
The name on all those accounts

19:27.209 --> 19:28.210
is mine.

19:30.504 --> 19:32.297
James is gonna go to jail
for something I did,

19:32.381 --> 19:34.758
and I'll have to live with someone else
paying for my mistakes.

19:34.842 --> 19:36.134
- So, if you love me--
- I do.

19:36.218 --> 19:39.680
I know you do.
You have to destroy what you found.

19:39.763 --> 19:43.308
I can't do that. Financial Crimes is
investigating because I pushed them.

19:43.392 --> 19:46.061
They'll know if I start getting in the way
and they'll come after me.

19:48.230 --> 19:49.940
There must be something?

19:53.277 --> 19:54.403
I can't talk right now.

19:54.486 --> 19:56.613
<i>No, we have to.</i>

19:56.697 --> 19:57.698
Okay, make it quick.

19:58.740 --> 20:01.451
Before you lose your shit on me, I just--

20:01.535 --> 20:03.829
I need you to know I was
just looking out for your best interest.

20:03.912 --> 20:06.665
And that the only reason
I didn't say something sooner

20:06.748 --> 20:08.584
is because I had no idea
who he was until--

20:08.667 --> 20:10.752
until you mentioned his name
to Todd on the roof.

20:10.836 --> 20:12.629
What the fuck are you talking about?

20:12.713 --> 20:15.757
Okay, just promise me
you won't make me the bad guy here.

20:16.258 --> 20:17.259
All right?

20:18.093 --> 20:20.220
Because I'm the only one
who saw the writing on the wall.

20:20.304 --> 20:23.223
<i>I'm the only one who did anything
to keep it from getting to this point.</i>

20:23.307 --> 20:25.893
So if you hear this
and you decide to hate me,

20:25.976 --> 20:27.644
you know, fuck that noise, okay?

20:27.728 --> 20:30.147
Harrison, just fucking say it.

20:31.899 --> 20:32.983
All right.

20:34.401 --> 20:37.279
I mean, the only way out of this shit
is if I fucking disappeared.

20:39.364 --> 20:40.490
I can't let you do that.

20:43.702 --> 20:45.078
Come with me.

20:46.038 --> 20:47.164
We could start over.

20:48.290 --> 20:49.583
Together. Just the two of us.

20:49.666 --> 20:52.503
- You want to run away together?
- Isn't that what we've been waiting for?

20:53.879 --> 20:54.880
What about your life?

20:54.963 --> 20:56.215
What, this?

20:57.841 --> 20:59.801
How would this even happen?

21:00.511 --> 21:03.180
We take a train, bus,
I don't fucking care.

21:03.263 --> 21:05.933
We walk away from all of this.
We leave this shit behind.

21:06.642 --> 21:07.726
Don't you get it?

21:08.560 --> 21:10.354
Here, we never stood a chance.

21:29.957 --> 21:31.959
Did you follow me here?
What the fuck, James?

21:32.042 --> 21:33.585
Get in the car. Get in.

21:42.177 --> 21:45.097
I told you not to go over there.
What did you tell him?

21:46.598 --> 21:47.891
Everything.

21:47.975 --> 21:49.518
So, what did he say?

21:51.395 --> 21:52.396
He'll destroy it.

21:53.230 --> 21:54.231
All of it.

21:55.232 --> 21:56.233
Just like that?

21:57.234 --> 21:58.235
Pretty much.

22:02.489 --> 22:04.825
If only we could trust a word he says.

22:07.244 --> 22:10.080
Has he ever told you how you two met?

22:13.250 --> 22:14.251
Outside a party.

22:16.170 --> 22:18.172
Has he ever told you
what he was doing there?

22:23.051 --> 22:24.636
Waiting out the rain.

22:29.016 --> 22:30.017
Why?

22:30.100 --> 22:32.686
Well, I guess his job
wasn't always so lucrative.

22:33.187 --> 22:35.147
Because he used to do
some work on the side,

22:35.230 --> 22:38.942
which is how Harrison ended up
hiring him to look into you.

22:41.236 --> 22:42.237
What?

22:42.905 --> 22:45.365
Make sure you weren't gonna do
exactly what you ended up doing.

22:46.366 --> 22:49.244
And the only reason
nothing came of his investigation

22:49.328 --> 22:52.789
is because instead of doing what he was
supposed to do, what he was paid to do,

22:53.290 --> 22:55.876
instead he decided to start following you.

22:57.419 --> 23:00.631
Started showing up in places
where he knew you'd be.

23:01.882 --> 23:03.550
<i>He was stalking you, Sophie.</i>

23:03.634 --> 23:05.344
<i>That's what he's always been doing.</i>

23:07.179 --> 23:10.641
So I think it'd be incredibly stupid
to assume a man like that

23:10.724 --> 23:11.850
is gonna keep his word.

23:18.982 --> 23:20.442
I'll handle it, okay?

23:22.110 --> 23:23.111
We have people.

23:25.531 --> 23:27.866
And what do those people do?

23:28.325 --> 23:30.285
We're not gonna fucking hurt him, Soph.

23:32.204 --> 23:34.665
We're just going to make sure
that he knows

23:34.748 --> 23:36.166
that destroying that evidence…

23:38.502 --> 23:39.628
that's his only choice.

24:50.324 --> 24:51.867
<i>Get over here. Come on.</i>

24:53.577 --> 24:54.745
This is a terrible idea.

24:56.079 --> 24:57.289
<i>It's no big deal.</i>

24:57.998 --> 24:59.875
<i>No one's ever gonna see it but us.</i>

25:09.843 --> 25:11.887
You're no fun at all.

25:15.724 --> 25:17.726
<i>Have you thought about what I've said?</i>

25:19.895 --> 25:22.814
<i>You and me,
just the two of us somewhere warm.</i>

25:25.025 --> 25:26.443
<i>What am I supposed to do,</i>

25:26.527 --> 25:29.655
<i>just pack up and leave, write him a note?</i>

25:30.280 --> 25:32.157
<i>People leave each other all the time.</i>

25:33.367 --> 25:34.493
<i>I love you, Sophie.</i>

25:36.203 --> 25:37.538
<i>And isn't that all that matters?</i>

25:42.334 --> 25:44.127
<i>This was never about the future.</i>

25:44.962 --> 25:47.589
<i>Let's just enjoy the moment.</i>

25:49.716 --> 25:51.468
<i>And isn't that all that matters?</i>

25:56.348 --> 25:58.225
<i>This was never about the future.</i>

25:59.059 --> 26:01.520
<i>Let's just enjoy the moment.</i>

26:02.145 --> 26:03.146
<i>Can you do that?</i>

26:09.444 --> 26:11.488
<i>This was never about the future.</i>

26:12.155 --> 26:14.658
<i>Let's just enjoy the moment.</i>

26:30.507 --> 26:32.009
If we hadn't met by chance,

26:33.427 --> 26:36.346
if it wasn't some grand coincidence
that night outside in the rain,

26:37.973 --> 26:41.351
and you were actually there
because someone paid you to follow me,

26:42.311 --> 26:43.854
you'd have told me. Wouldn't you?

26:45.105 --> 26:48.233
You wouldn't have lied
about something like that, would you?

26:50.777 --> 26:52.321
That's not how it happened.

26:52.404 --> 26:55.157
Then how did it happen? Explain it to me.

26:57.492 --> 26:58.660
Okay, yeah.

26:58.744 --> 27:00.829
He told me to look into your past,
see what I could find.

27:01.496 --> 27:03.498
But all I found was someone who was lost.

27:03.582 --> 27:06.752
Someone else who was going through
the world alone. Someone like me.

27:06.835 --> 27:08.837
- How do I know that's not another lie?
- It's not.

27:08.921 --> 27:11.340
Then why not tell me
the truth from the beginning?

27:12.090 --> 27:14.593
If our connection was that strong,
it wouldn't have mattered, right?

27:14.676 --> 27:17.054
Yeah, I should've told you, okay?
I get it.

27:17.137 --> 27:19.181
But I didn't plan on it
happening this way.

27:19.264 --> 27:21.308
I didn't know when I came in the car
with you that night,

27:21.391 --> 27:23.227
I was going to fall in love with you,
Sophie.

27:23.310 --> 27:25.562
So instead,
you did what everyone else has done.

27:26.480 --> 27:29.358
Convinced me I was
who you wanted me to be,

27:29.983 --> 27:32.194
because you thought you knew me
better than I knew myself.

27:32.694 --> 27:34.321
And now I don't even know
who the fuck I am.

27:34.404 --> 27:36.573
- But you do know.
- Here's what's gonna happen.

27:37.282 --> 27:39.409
I'm going to walk out of this station,

27:39.493 --> 27:42.287
and you're going to destroy
whatever evidence you found about James.

27:42.371 --> 27:43.997
- You know I can't do that--
- And if you don't,

27:44.581 --> 27:46.708
if James or I ever see your face again,

27:47.417 --> 27:50.879
I'm going to the police, the press,
to anyone who will listen.

27:50.963 --> 27:53.590
And I'm telling them about
the entrapment, the blackmail,

27:53.674 --> 27:56.009
all the crimes you committed
because you were obsessed

27:56.093 --> 27:58.011
with putting the husband
of the woman you were fucking in jail.

27:58.095 --> 27:59.555
So you're blackmailing me now?

27:59.638 --> 28:00.806
Just like you blackmailed me.

28:02.099 --> 28:05.853
Telling me you could only destroy
that evidence if we left together.

28:06.687 --> 28:09.273
That was just another manipulation,
wasn't it?

28:09.356 --> 28:10.232
No, it was not.

28:11.108 --> 28:12.860
I guess we're gonna find out, aren't we?

28:13.777 --> 28:15.654
- You can't do this.
- Really? Why not?

28:15.737 --> 28:17.698
'Cause if you can't have me, no one can?

28:19.950 --> 28:22.870
Were we ever
gonna run away together, before?

28:23.662 --> 28:25.080
Or was that just a lie too?

28:26.748 --> 28:28.125
Maybe I'd already left you.

28:28.625 --> 28:31.545
Maybe all this is just playing out
the same as it did before.

28:31.628 --> 28:33.589
- I won't let it.
- It's not up to you.

28:36.466 --> 28:37.467
Goddamn!

28:52.649 --> 28:55.360
Where have you been?
I've been calling you all night.

28:57.404 --> 28:58.614
I went to see him.

29:02.409 --> 29:04.578
Fuck. You shouldn't have done that.

29:07.831 --> 29:08.999
I told him everything.

29:12.461 --> 29:13.462
Then what is it?

29:17.382 --> 29:20.969
Soph, we promised
we'd stop hiding things from each other.

29:21.053 --> 29:22.888
- What just happened?
- I don't know.

29:22.971 --> 29:23.847
You don't know?

29:24.515 --> 29:27.392
I don't know. I--

29:27.851 --> 29:29.561
How could I be so wrong about him?

29:30.604 --> 29:31.730
It's just--

29:32.272 --> 29:33.941
The things he said to me,

29:34.024 --> 29:35.901
they seemed like the answer

29:35.984 --> 29:38.153
to the one question
I couldn't get out of my head.

29:38.237 --> 29:39.738
What question?

29:43.033 --> 29:44.701
What if I didn't jump?

29:52.543 --> 29:53.544
What?

29:58.090 --> 30:01.552
I keep having these memories

30:02.845 --> 30:03.887
of a man…

30:05.722 --> 30:07.015
pushing me from the ferry.

30:08.559 --> 30:09.977
Hannah told me they're not real.

30:10.561 --> 30:12.396
They're my mind's defense
against the unknown,

30:12.479 --> 30:14.940
but that hasn't stopped me
from seeing them over and over.

30:20.821 --> 30:22.322
I knew it.

30:23.740 --> 30:26.618
I knew you couldn't have jumped.

30:26.702 --> 30:29.329
It never made any sense to me.

30:29.413 --> 30:30.998
I even said so to the doctor,

30:31.081 --> 30:33.208
and he told me
that's what everyone thinks, but…

30:35.711 --> 30:39.298
but I just didn't have
another explanation until now.

30:46.096 --> 30:47.097
What are you saying?

30:51.393 --> 30:52.728
What you're thinking.

31:02.112 --> 31:04.072
Sophie, he's unstable.

31:04.698 --> 31:05.824
He's obsessed with you.

31:05.908 --> 31:09.411
He lied to you about
the very nature of his existence.

31:09.494 --> 31:12.414
What if he was doing it
to cover up something he did?

31:16.877 --> 31:19.213
Tell me you don't think
he's capable of doing that.

32:01.296 --> 32:02.339
<i>Leave a message.</i>

32:05.592 --> 32:06.426
Hi.

32:07.094 --> 32:09.221
<i>I think you know who this is.</i>

32:09.721 --> 32:12.850
<i>I wanted you to know. I know everything.</i>

32:12.933 --> 32:14.351
<i>The burner phone.</i>

32:14.434 --> 32:15.644
<i>The stalking.</i>

32:16.311 --> 32:19.273
You're just doing
the exact same thing you did before.

32:20.732 --> 32:23.026
<i>I don't know what the fuck
you thought was gonna happen,</i>

32:23.610 --> 32:25.612
but I do know this.

32:26.113 --> 32:28.490
<i>She's never gonna be with you.</i>

32:28.991 --> 32:34.413
<i>And if you ever try to hurt her again,
things are gonna end a lot worse for you.</i>

33:21.502 --> 33:22.669
You left the house at all?

33:29.676 --> 33:31.929
Soph, we took care of it.

33:32.554 --> 33:35.432
He's given up.
He's never gonna try and hurt you again.

33:35.933 --> 33:36.934
I promise.

33:39.269 --> 33:40.270
It's over.

33:41.939 --> 33:44.024
Now it's time for us to go live our lives.

33:45.359 --> 33:46.360
Look, he's--

33:47.027 --> 33:48.695
he's had some time to cool off,

33:48.779 --> 33:50.572
really think about
everything we have on him,

33:50.656 --> 33:53.534
and I'm sure he's realized
that it's just not worth the risk.

33:55.244 --> 33:56.662
You don't know him.

33:56.745 --> 33:58.247
He's obsessive.

33:59.122 --> 34:00.332
He's not suicidal.

34:02.042 --> 34:04.837
Fuck, I'm sorry.

34:04.920 --> 34:05.921
You know what I mean.

34:09.049 --> 34:10.259
Do I?

34:15.097 --> 34:16.098
Hey…

34:18.266 --> 34:19.268
I--

34:20.643 --> 34:24.356
I got us a table
at a little place in the neighborhood,

34:24.438 --> 34:25.774
just around the block.

34:27.234 --> 34:28.235
What do you say?

34:29.360 --> 34:31.530
Look, we can't let this
control us forever.

34:32.030 --> 34:33.031
We just can't.

34:42.123 --> 34:43.125
So is that a yes?

34:45.627 --> 34:46.628
Yeah.

34:50.716 --> 34:52.217
Looks strange.

34:52.801 --> 34:54.178
Not at all. Here. Try it.

34:59.766 --> 35:00.893
- Holy shit.
- Right?

35:03.103 --> 35:05.439
It's almost like you knew I would like it.

35:17.201 --> 35:18.202
To fresh starts.

35:20.913 --> 35:21.914
Fresh starts.

35:29.546 --> 35:30.923
Order me another before I get back?

35:31.006 --> 35:32.841
Of course. It's down the hall.

35:32.925 --> 35:33.926
Okay.

35:42.267 --> 35:43.310
Sophie.

35:44.436 --> 35:46.647
I'm sorry. You were right.

35:47.314 --> 35:48.607
I should have told you the truth.

35:49.274 --> 35:50.943
I was just so scared of losing you again.

35:52.277 --> 35:53.737
What happened to you?

35:54.571 --> 35:56.615
Guys I was infiltrating
found out I was a cop.

35:58.283 --> 35:59.910
Someone wanted me dead, blew my cover.

36:01.078 --> 36:04.414
Look, I tried to forget about you
like you forgot about me, but I couldn't.

36:05.374 --> 36:07.918
And I think I let that twist the way
I was seeing things.

36:08.001 --> 36:10.337
I know that's no excuse,
but I never meant to hurt you.

36:12.589 --> 36:15.008
- You said you tried to forget me?
- And I couldn't.

36:15.592 --> 36:16.760
Try harder.

36:16.844 --> 36:19.263
Sophie. Take this.

36:21.765 --> 36:22.933
What the fuck?

36:24.309 --> 36:26.728
Look, I swear I'm not here
to hurt anyone, okay?

36:26.812 --> 36:27.855
The fuck you aren't.

36:27.938 --> 36:29.022
James!

36:29.982 --> 36:32.234
Oh, my goodness. Oh, my God!

36:32.317 --> 36:34.778
Hey, hey! That's it! Hey!

36:34.862 --> 36:37.072
- Break it up!
- Get off!

36:53.297 --> 36:55.090
He said he'd survived an attempted hit.

36:57.634 --> 36:59.011
Someone blew his cover.

37:01.680 --> 37:02.681
And?

37:05.976 --> 37:08.687
Did you have anything to do with that?

37:09.188 --> 37:12.191
Are you fucking kidding me, Sophie?

37:15.694 --> 37:18.572
Honestly, Sophie, I know there's
a lot going through your head right now,

37:18.655 --> 37:20.032
a lot of disorienting things,

37:20.115 --> 37:22.492
but how you can possibly believe
a single fucking word

37:22.576 --> 37:23.911
that comes out of that man's mouth.

37:23.994 --> 37:26.288
After everything he's put us through!
Jesus.

37:27.497 --> 37:29.166
It's fucking beyond me!

40:04.696 --> 40:06.823
- One of us?
- Undercover.

40:06.907 --> 40:08.575
Drug ring caught up with him.

40:09.576 --> 40:10.577
Jesus.

40:10.661 --> 40:11.954
Hey.

40:12.037 --> 40:13.038
Hey.

40:14.831 --> 40:16.834
Come on. Let's get you home. Come on.

41:02.254 --> 41:03.922
Come on. Let's get some rest.

41:46.465 --> 41:47.966
Come on. Sit down.

41:52.262 --> 41:53.263
There's a video…

41:55.349 --> 41:57.017
that he gave me at the restaurant.

41:57.768 --> 41:59.895
Footage from a passing boat…

42:01.897 --> 42:02.898
from my accident.

42:03.941 --> 42:06.318
My… jump.

42:07.903 --> 42:09.112
'Cause that's what it was.

42:10.322 --> 42:11.323
I jumped.

42:12.074 --> 42:13.075
Alone.

42:14.493 --> 42:15.953
No one pushed me.

42:23.418 --> 42:24.419
Y--

42:26.421 --> 42:29.049
Wait,
you told me you thought he pushed you.

42:31.593 --> 42:32.594
No…

42:34.805 --> 42:35.806
you did.

42:37.140 --> 42:39.726
But you-- I mean,
you didn't disagree with me.

42:40.561 --> 42:41.728
I mean, the moment I said it,

42:41.812 --> 42:44.189
you looked at me like
you've been thinking it the whole time.

42:54.324 --> 42:55.325
Look,

42:56.410 --> 43:00.539
the man inserted himself into our lives

43:00.622 --> 43:04.209
over and over again.

43:04.293 --> 43:06.003
He stalked you.

43:06.920 --> 43:10.424
He filled your head
with things that weren't true about me.

43:10.507 --> 43:11.341
About you too.

43:11.425 --> 43:13.552
He was obsessed with you, Sophie.

43:14.970 --> 43:17.097
Obsessed with getting me away from you.

43:17.181 --> 43:18.182
That's the truth.

43:21.101 --> 43:22.102
That's the truth.

43:22.895 --> 43:24.104
Where are you going?

43:24.188 --> 43:26.648
Try and make
some fucking sense of this all.

43:27.357 --> 43:31.278
James, you can't just walk away from this.

43:38.243 --> 43:43.624
If you think that just because
he didn't push you,

43:45.417 --> 43:47.836
that he wasn't capable
of doing something like that,

43:47.920 --> 43:51.882
or that all of this wasn't
hurtling towards an ending like that…

44:04.436 --> 44:06.021
This is not our fault.

44:06.772 --> 44:07.773
Okay?

44:10.859 --> 44:12.444
Tell me you understand that.

44:18.575 --> 44:21.954
Look, we did nothing wrong, okay?

44:23.956 --> 44:25.582
We did nothing wrong.
