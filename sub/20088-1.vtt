00:34.172 --> 00:36.209
Fenix...

00:37.838 --> 00:39.875
Please...

00:42.505 --> 00:44.744
Eat like a human being.

01:09.837 --> 01:13.036
You can't just stay here all the time.

01:13.129 --> 01:15.166
Not seeing anyone.

01:27.212 --> 01:29.249
Now come on, stand up.

01:32.461 --> 01:35.624
Come on now. Your foot.

01:38.003 --> 01:40.289
That's it.

01:40.378 --> 01:42.415
The other one.

03:03.834 --> 03:08.158
Don't miss the Circo del Gringo,
the greatest show on earth!

03:08.250 --> 03:10.619
The death-defying trapeze girl!

03:10.708 --> 03:15.032
The boy magician!
Come and see them now! Come on!

03:15.125 --> 03:17.909
See the tiger from the Indian jungle!

03:18.000 --> 03:20.748
The elephant from darkest Africa!

03:20.833 --> 03:24.661
The furry monkey! Roll up! Roll up!

03:24.750 --> 03:26.954
Go and see the Circo del Gringo!

03:27.041 --> 03:31.781
Aladin, the world's smallest elephant trainer!
Roll up! Roll up!

03:38.124 --> 03:40.280
Roll up! Roll up! Come and see...

03:56.832 --> 04:00.279
Papa! Wake up, wake up!
They're here!

04:00.374 --> 04:03.905
Get the hell out of here!
I told you not to bother me!

04:15.165 --> 04:17.202
Why does he drink so much?

04:17.290 --> 04:21.118
My mother says he killed a woman
in America.

04:21.206 --> 04:23.243
And he can't go back?

04:25.789 --> 04:29.829
Tough life.
Come on, let's go see the new act.

04:29.914 --> 04:31.951
- The new act?
- Yes!

04:32.039 --> 04:35.902
The Tattooed Woman!

04:44.581 --> 04:46.618
Now come on.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.912
Come on! Come on!

04:51.997 --> 04:54.911
Come on! Don't be afraid!

04:54.997 --> 04:57.532
Come on!

04:57.622 --> 05:00.075
You can't do anything!

05:00.955 --> 05:04.651
Read my lips, you stupid deaf-mute.

05:05.247 --> 05:08.079
Come on, don't just stand there!

05:10.080 --> 05:15.032
I should have left you in the poorhouse
when your mother died. Now practice!

05:15.121 --> 05:17.158
Or I'll beat you.

05:17.246 --> 05:19.283
What's goin' on here?

05:19.371 --> 05:22.238
Oh, Mr. Orgo.

05:32.412 --> 05:34.449
Here I`am.

05:41.495 --> 05:44.694
The ocean!

05:44.787 --> 05:46.991
It's a peacock!

05:47.079 --> 05:50.242
It's the moon.

05:50.329 --> 05:53.031
- Here's a fish!
- Cloud.

05:53.120 --> 05:56.070
- And a crab!
- The ocean!

06:00.787 --> 06:02.824
Nice to meet you.

06:03.661 --> 06:05.947
Come with me.

06:19.911 --> 06:23.323
- Against the board.
- Anything you say, Mr. Orgo.

08:35.615 --> 08:38.068
Blasphemy! Idiots!

08:38.157 --> 08:40.194
Sacrilege!

08:57.864 --> 09:00.186
Mother! Mother!

09:00.281 --> 09:03.646
Blasphemy! This is our church!

09:03.739 --> 09:09.356
All right, get them off my land right now
or I'll run 'em over!

09:09.447 --> 09:13.985
Go ahead but you'll have to kill us all!
Go ahead!

09:14.072 --> 09:16.441
- Then go ahead!
- Mother!

09:17.281 --> 09:20.728
No!

09:29.947 --> 09:32.565
No! Don't hurt her!

09:40.155 --> 09:42.394
We are not afraid of you.

10:07.487 --> 10:12.227
El fin del mundo se acerca ya

10:14.195 --> 10:19.480
Toda esperanza se acabará

10:20.737 --> 10:26.318
Ya las señales se están cumpliendo

10:27.403 --> 10:32.522
Se están cumpliendo como escrito está

10:33.903 --> 10:40.017
Querido amigo, Lirio te llama

10:41.611 --> 10:46.647
No hagas duro tu corazón

10:48.319 --> 10:53.687
Ríndete a Lirio, dale tu alma

10:55.486 --> 11:00.557
Y tendrás parte en la resurrección

11:01.861 --> 11:04.728
Peace! I bring peace.

11:04.819 --> 11:07.354
- Come now.
- Father.

11:10.319 --> 11:12.356
Peace.

11:13.277 --> 11:17.436
Please, Father, help us.
They want to destroy our temple.

11:17.527 --> 11:19.683
I won't let them do such a thing.

11:19.777 --> 11:24.149
Peace. Peace. Let me see your church.

11:26.777 --> 11:28.814
This is it, Monsignor.

11:36.026 --> 11:41.560
This is where we worship...
our beloved saint and martyr.

12:02.651 --> 12:05.317
Here she is, Monsignor.

12:08.859 --> 12:12.438
But... this is no saint.

12:13.733 --> 12:17.561
Monsignor, she is a saint.

12:17.650 --> 12:19.687
How could you?

12:23.858 --> 12:28.017
Right here, many years ago,

12:29.108 --> 12:34.725
Lirio, a young girl, was attacked
by the Terrano brothers.

12:42.649 --> 12:46.014
She tried to fight them off
with all her strength,

12:46.108 --> 12:48.596
but they cut off her arms.

12:59.190 --> 13:01.678
They raped her...

13:01.774 --> 13:04.688
and left her to die in a pool of blood.

13:05.940 --> 13:11.225
And on this ground,
miraculously still wet with her holy blood,

13:11.315 --> 13:13.471
we built our church.

13:24.565 --> 13:27.930
- This is paint!
- No, it's holy blood.

13:28.023 --> 13:30.641
- This is paint!
- It's holy blood!

13:30.731 --> 13:33.433
Do you hear me, crazy woman? It's paint!

13:33.523 --> 13:36.355
- It's blood! It's blood!
- Feel it! Feel it!

13:36.439 --> 13:40.053
This is paint! It is paint! This is paint!

13:40.148 --> 13:44.604
Holy blood! It's holy blood!

13:44.689 --> 13:46.726
It's holy blood!

14:01.814 --> 14:05.510
- It's paint!
- Holy blood.

14:12.855 --> 14:18.010
I order you to stop...
this foolish sacrilege... immediately.

14:18.105 --> 14:21.186
Never! This is our saint!

14:21.271 --> 14:27.516
The church will never recognise...
this heresy!

14:27.604 --> 14:30.471
Don't dare! Holy blood!

14:31.563 --> 14:33.885
Cantemos todos!

14:36.521 --> 14:42.848
Holy blood. Holy blood!
Holy blood! Holy blood!

14:42.937 --> 14:46.717
Holy blood! Holy blood! Holy blood!

14:48.229 --> 14:50.266
Holy blood!

14:50.354 --> 14:53.517
Holy blood! Holy blood!

14:53.604 --> 14:58.593
Come, Kevin, I don't want this
to soil your pure soul.

14:58.687 --> 15:02.052
- Let's go.
- Yes, go! Get out of here!

15:03.562 --> 15:06.643
Go ahead and destroy this abomination!

15:09.228 --> 15:10.620
Holy blood!

15:11.436 --> 15:14.220
Holy blood!

15:17.603 --> 15:21.845
- Holy blood! Holy blood!
- Holy blood!

15:23.269 --> 15:25.306
Go ahead!

15:34.519 --> 15:36.723
Don't run away!

15:55.435 --> 15:58.267
Mother! No!

16:00.768 --> 16:03.552
- No, no! No, no!
- No.

16:08.768 --> 16:11.552
Kill me! Go ahead!

16:11.643 --> 16:14.925
Kill me! Kill me!

16:15.018 --> 16:17.055
Kill me!

16:17.143 --> 16:20.757
- Kill me! Go ahead!
- Mother! Mother!

16:20.851 --> 16:23.137
Go ahead!

18:03.681 --> 18:06.134
Hey!

19:45.595 --> 19:47.632
Mr. Orgo...

19:53.594 --> 19:57.836
Orgo has a decent wife.
Stay away from him...

19:57.928 --> 19:59.965
or I'll kill you!

20:00.053 --> 20:03.050
She's crazy!

20:05.594 --> 20:07.963
Get up. Get up!

20:08.052 --> 20:10.208
You bastard!

20:35.093 --> 20:37.332
My little child.

20:37.426 --> 20:39.463
No...

20:42.510 --> 20:46.171
Don't. Don't. Don't laugh!

20:50.926 --> 20:52.963
Don't do that!

21:34.258 --> 21:37.504
Stop! Nobody goes any further.
Leave them alone.

21:37.591 --> 21:39.628
Get out of here. Vamoose. Vamoose.

21:39.716 --> 21:41.753
Vamoose. Vamoose.

22:30.756 --> 22:34.168
- What's happened?
- The elephant is dying.

22:37.839 --> 22:40.789
Please, don't die.

22:43.048 --> 22:44.872
Please...

23:39.879 --> 23:41.916
Don't die.

27:02.415 --> 27:05.531
Stop crying... like a little girl.

27:08.581 --> 27:10.618
I'll give you a charm.

27:10.706 --> 27:12.992
That'll make you a man.

30:52.116 --> 30:55.777
There... now you're a man.

30:56.866 --> 30:58.903
Just like me.

32:29.196 --> 32:34.102
Ladies and gentlemen,
Fenix, the boy magician!

34:04.194 --> 34:07.725
Concha, queen of the flying trapeze!

34:07.818 --> 34:10.685
Hanging by her own hair!

35:14.108 --> 35:18.765
Put me down! Put me down!

35:18.858 --> 35:22.140
Quick, quick! Down! Down!

35:26.149 --> 35:28.186
Quick. Quick.

35:31.899 --> 35:33.936
Go away!

35:34.024 --> 35:37.223
- Music! Music!
- Concha!

35:59.398 --> 36:01.767
Mummy! Mum!

36:01.857 --> 36:04.262
Shh! Get in the trailer.

36:04.357 --> 36:07.603
Keep quiet. Go! Go...

37:03.438 --> 37:05.475
Come on, come on, come on.

39:23.559 --> 39:27.339
Yo ya me voy

39:29.142 --> 39:34.759
Al puerto donde se haya

39:38.017 --> 39:41.880
La barca de oro

39:45.683 --> 39:50.174
Que debe conducirme

39:50.266 --> 39:53.927
Yo ya me voy

39:56.891 --> 40:03.302
Sólo vengo a despedirme

40:05.849 --> 40:10.387
Adiós mujer

40:11.766 --> 40:16.885
Adiós para siempre, adiós...

40:16.974 --> 40:19.379
Come on.

40:19.474 --> 40:23.681
No volverán

40:25.265 --> 40:31.213
Tus ojos a mirarme

40:32.973 --> 40:37.925
Ni tus oídos

40:40.015 --> 40:44.588
Escucharán mi canto

40:44.681 --> 40:48.377
Voy a aumentar...

40:48.473 --> 40:50.095
No!

40:50.181 --> 40:55.596
Los mares con mi llanto

40:58.723 --> 41:02.798
Adiós mujer

41:04.722 --> 41:10.220
Adiós para siempre, adiós

41:32.847 --> 41:35.169
Come here, come on, come on.
Come on.

41:35.263 --> 41:37.300
This is Fenix.

41:45.054 --> 41:47.091
Yes.

41:55.929 --> 41:57.966
Give me your hand.

41:58.054 --> 42:00.091
Thanks, Fenix.

42:10.054 --> 42:12.091
Come along now.

42:22.803 --> 42:26.049
Come on, Fenix.
They're around here somewhere.

42:37.845 --> 42:41.755
Now, Fenix. Thank you.

42:41.844 --> 42:43.881
Form a circle!

42:49.511 --> 42:51.548
Good boy, Fenix.

42:51.636 --> 42:54.384
Everybody wave. Hands up like this!

42:55.677 --> 42:58.247
Go on!

43:08.760 --> 43:10.797
Music.

43:10.885 --> 43:14.960
And now... we will have some fruit!

43:15.052 --> 43:18.499
- Come on, let's have some fruit.
- We'll have some fruit!

43:18.593 --> 43:20.630
One for you...

43:34.926 --> 43:36.963
New friends, Fenix.

43:38.259 --> 43:40.296
Rudolph...

43:42.843 --> 43:44.833
Mauricio...

43:47.092 --> 43:49.129
Daniel...

43:50.509 --> 43:52.546
Marcos...

43:52.634 --> 43:54.671
and Darío.

43:56.217 --> 43:58.254
They are going to the movies tonight.

43:59.134 --> 44:01.171
- Yes?
- Yes.

44:01.259 --> 44:04.173
And you are going with them.

44:05.550 --> 44:08.464
- Yes.
- Yes.

44:20.175 --> 44:22.212
Come on, my dear.

44:23.591 --> 44:25.628
Here we are, out you get.

44:27.008 --> 44:30.089
Come on, Daniel. Come on, you two.

44:33.133 --> 44:36.498
- Come on, stay together.
- Come along.

44:37.466 --> 44:41.246
Now we will see a great film
about Robinson Crusoe.

44:41.341 --> 44:44.457
Is everybody here? Come on, Fenix.

44:44.549 --> 44:48.377
Ah, yes. Robinson Crusoe,
one of life's castaways.

44:48.466 --> 44:51.499
Yes. Good boy, Darío.

44:51.590 --> 44:54.160
Goodbye. Goodbye!

44:54.257 --> 44:56.461
I have to go with my grandmother.

44:56.549 --> 44:59.499
Goodbye! We're going to the synagogue.

44:59.590 --> 45:03.204
Hello, little boy. Nice little boy.

45:03.298 --> 45:06.793
Good morning.
I`am Robinson Crusoe.

45:06.882 --> 45:09.417
Bye! Enjoy the movie!

45:09.507 --> 45:12.588
And don't worry, we will wait for you.

45:12.673 --> 45:14.710
Come along.

45:21.631 --> 45:26.039
Vengan, vengan.
Come, I have a present for you.

45:28.756 --> 45:32.879
Listen, this kind of stuff
will make you sick.

45:32.964 --> 45:36.957
If you promise not to tell,
I'll take you somewhere else...

45:38.214 --> 45:42.337
that's much more fun than the movies.

45:43.714 --> 45:48.703
A little sniff of this...
And we'll see.

45:55.130 --> 45:57.167
Sniff.

45:58.380 --> 46:01.959
Ándele para adentro.

46:04.172 --> 46:06.838
De la buena!

46:08.213 --> 46:10.250
Yes, yes.

46:12.880 --> 46:14.704
Vamos amigos!

46:38.171 --> 46:41.832
Qué le pasa a Lupita?
No sé

46:41.920 --> 46:43.875
Qué le pasa a esa niña?
No sé

46:43.962 --> 46:45.751
Qué es lo que quiere?
Bailar

46:45.837 --> 46:47.626
Por qué ella no baila?

46:47.712 --> 46:49.418
Cagón!

46:49.504 --> 46:51.624
Que dice su mama
Que sí

46:51.712 --> 46:55.540
Que baile Lupita
Sí sí

46:55.628 --> 46:57.748
Mambo, mambo, mambo, mambo...
Sí!

46:57.837 --> 47:01.368
Sí! Sí! Sí!

47:27.794 --> 47:29.831
Here.

47:29.919 --> 47:32.489
There you go, Lores.

47:32.586 --> 47:37.159
How much for the five pendejitos?

47:37.252 --> 47:39.538
For all of them, $20.

47:39.627 --> 47:42.293
Five for you, 15 for me.

48:08.751 --> 48:14.948
Vengan, vengan chaparritos al hotel.

48:15.043 --> 48:19.451
Me los voy a comer.

48:28.251 --> 48:32.031
Mira, mira lo que me encontré.

48:32.125 --> 48:35.953
- Like me?
- Mírame!

48:36.042 --> 48:39.621
Mírame, dame un trocito.

48:39.709 --> 48:42.872
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro

48:42.958 --> 48:46.453
Cinco, seis, siete, ocho

48:46.542 --> 48:50.037
Mambo!

49:25.665 --> 49:27.702
Fenix?

49:27.790 --> 49:30.243
Fenix?

49:43.582 --> 49:46.248
Have fun last night?

49:52.456 --> 49:54.493
How do you feel?

50:16.789 --> 50:20.569
Good! Very good.

50:20.664 --> 50:23.745
Now eat, hm?

50:23.830 --> 50:26.863
I'll be back later, all right?

50:26.955 --> 50:32.619
All right, out we go. Out we go.
Today we have home-made chicken soup.

50:32.705 --> 50:35.027
Fenix!

50:35.122 --> 50:37.112
Fenix!

51:09.371 --> 51:16.078
Siento en el alma

51:19.120 --> 51:24.405
Unas ganas inmensas

51:24.495 --> 51:26.532
De llorar

51:29.037 --> 51:33.361
Tu me haces falta

51:35.703 --> 51:44.152
Y juré no decírtelo jamás

51:45.536 --> 51:49.944
Yo quiero hacerte

51:52.578 --> 52:01.774
Con mis lágrimas un collar de perlas

52:03.286 --> 52:06.900
Déjame llorar

52:06.994 --> 52:12.113
Porque hoy ya te perdí

52:12.202 --> 52:17.617
Queriéndote olvidar

52:17.702 --> 52:24.860
Me acuerdo más

52:24.952 --> 52:31.777
De ti

53:17.450 --> 53:20.531
Inside.

53:28.700 --> 53:30.524
Come on.

53:30.616 --> 53:33.483
Sit over there!

53:36.783 --> 53:39.353
If I can get a proper drink...

53:39.449 --> 53:41.569
Oh! Hup!

53:41.658 --> 53:43.814
- Come here, now.
- Give me that, brother.

53:43.908 --> 53:46.610
Hey, come over, baby.
Come on.

53:46.699 --> 53:48.736
Yeah.

53:49.866 --> 53:53.065
I'll give you another tattoo, baby!

53:55.824 --> 53:57.861
Where is his girl?

53:57.949 --> 54:02.689
- Where's his money?
- First he's gotta see what he's payin' for.

54:29.489 --> 54:31.526
She's a deaf-mute.

54:31.614 --> 54:36.022
So you can do whatever you want with her
and no one will hear her.

57:17.985 --> 57:19.975
Amiga, adónde vas?

58:35.776 --> 58:42.104
Now, when she comes back,
I'm gonna take care of you! You little bitch!

58:44.942 --> 58:47.015
Oh, no!

1:00:02.567 --> 1:00:05.399
Aquel amor

1:00:07.108 --> 1:00:14.811
Que marchitó mi vida

1:00:16.483 --> 1:00:20.606
Aquel amor

1:00:20.691 --> 1:00:26.604
Que fue mi perdición

1:00:28.441 --> 1:00:32.600
Dónde andará

1:00:33.233 --> 1:00:39.763
La prenda más querida

1:00:41.275 --> 1:00:45.599
Dónde andará

1:00:45.691 --> 1:00:51.225
Aquel, aquel amor

1:00:51.316 --> 1:00:54.728
Aquel amor

1:00:56.025 --> 1:01:03.763
Que marchitó mi vida

1:01:05.108 --> 1:01:07.264
Aquel amor

1:01:09.858 --> 1:01:14.894
Que fue mi perdición

1:01:17.524 --> 1:01:21.469
Dónde andará

1:01:21.566 --> 1:01:28.936
La prenda más querida

1:01:30.024 --> 1:01:34.147
Dónde andará

1:01:34.233 --> 1:01:39.814
Aquel, aquel amor

1:02:02.107 --> 1:02:04.144
Aladin.

1:02:15.149 --> 1:02:16.807
Mr. Fenix.

1:02:21.566 --> 1:02:23.603
Let's go.

1:02:43.774 --> 1:02:45.811
In the beginning

1:02:45.899 --> 1:02:48.647
God created the heavens

1:02:49.857 --> 1:02:51.894
And the earth

1:02:54.815 --> 1:02:56.852
Water

1:03:09.732 --> 1:03:11.769
Fish

1:03:24.732 --> 1:03:26.769
And plants

1:03:35.065 --> 1:03:37.102
And trees

1:03:38.815 --> 1:03:41.268
Yielding fruit

1:03:48.190 --> 1:03:50.346
And birds

1:03:50.440 --> 1:03:53.307
Flying above the earth

1:03:55.898 --> 1:03:57.935
And God created...

1:04:00.148 --> 1:04:02.185
Man!

1:04:02.940 --> 1:04:04.977
And woman.

1:04:05.065 --> 1:04:07.102
And...

1:04:07.190 --> 1:04:09.227
Woman

1:04:10.773 --> 1:04:12.846
Then the serpent

1:04:13.731 --> 1:04:16.219
Came with temptation...

1:04:40.648 --> 1:04:44.262
And with all sorts of fruit

1:04:48.523 --> 1:04:50.560
Now, eat it.

1:05:00.023 --> 1:05:02.060
And then

1:05:02.148 --> 1:05:04.980
They knew sin

1:05:06.314 --> 1:05:09.513
Universal... universal sin!

1:05:39.397 --> 1:05:42.348
- You were fantastic.
- That's enough.

1:05:42.439 --> 1:05:44.476
I'm so tired.

1:05:45.356 --> 1:05:47.393
I want to get out of here.

1:05:50.064 --> 1:05:52.101
Fenix.

1:06:00.731 --> 1:06:02.768
With your hands...

1:06:04.564 --> 1:06:06.803
and my body...

1:06:06.897 --> 1:06:10.807
we'll have an act that will be...
sensational.

1:06:10.897 --> 1:06:13.930
Come on.

1:06:31.105 --> 1:06:35.726
Ladies and gentlemen, Rubi the Virgin!

1:07:09.022 --> 1:07:11.724
Bésame

1:07:13.230 --> 1:07:17.058
Bésame mucho

1:07:19.897 --> 1:07:23.725
Como si fuera esta noche

1:07:23.813 --> 1:07:27.853
La última vez

1:07:30.647 --> 1:07:34.012
Bésame

1:07:34.105 --> 1:07:38.561
Bésame mucho

1:07:40.521 --> 1:07:45.059
Que tengo miedo a perderte...

1:08:31.979 --> 1:08:35.510
- I've been thinking about your idea.
- You have?

1:08:35.604 --> 1:08:38.471
- Can we see each other later?
- Sure.

1:08:38.563 --> 1:08:40.932
Here?

1:08:41.021 --> 1:08:43.260
I love your nose.

1:09:28.479 --> 1:09:30.801
Oh, you scared me.

1:09:42.979 --> 1:09:45.016
I was thinking...

1:09:45.104 --> 1:09:47.260
how we could join...

1:09:48.270 --> 1:09:50.307
your art...

1:09:54.270 --> 1:09:56.307
and mine.

1:10:00.187 --> 1:10:03.883
A man like you always finds a way.

1:10:07.062 --> 1:10:09.301
I will do anything you want.

1:10:15.854 --> 1:10:18.058
First...

1:10:21.854 --> 1:10:23.891
I will tie you to a wheel...

1:10:31.437 --> 1:10:33.557
and I will throw knives at you.

1:10:36.520 --> 1:10:38.557
One here.

1:10:40.353 --> 1:10:42.390
One here.

1:10:47.020 --> 1:10:49.887
And one here, next to your mouth,

1:10:49.978 --> 1:10:53.059
so you can kiss it with your lips.

1:10:55.687 --> 1:10:57.724
And then...

1:11:00.062 --> 1:11:03.641
the last one... here.

1:11:12.937 --> 1:11:14.974
I will be afraid.

1:11:15.061 --> 1:11:17.727
Don't worry, you'll love it...

1:11:17.811 --> 1:11:20.180
because I will hypnotise you.

1:12:39.436 --> 1:12:41.473
Fenix!

1:12:46.352 --> 1:12:48.591
You know what you have to do.

1:12:48.686 --> 1:12:51.553
No, I don't want to!

1:12:56.144 --> 1:13:01.014
This girl has defiled you with her lust.

1:13:01.102 --> 1:13:04.218
No, Mum, it's not true!
It is only a game!

1:13:07.102 --> 1:13:09.720
No! I can't!

1:13:09.811 --> 1:13:11.848
Don't ask me to!

1:13:11.936 --> 1:13:15.764
I'm not asking you, I'm ordering...

1:13:16.894 --> 1:13:21.965
my hands... and my arms...

1:13:22.061 --> 1:13:24.098
to kill her.

1:13:26.936 --> 1:13:29.092
Kill her!

1:13:47.894 --> 1:13:49.931
Stupid!

1:13:51.560 --> 1:13:53.597
Wake her up.

1:14:16.185 --> 1:14:18.222
Put her in the car.

1:14:19.977 --> 1:14:22.014
And get a suitcase ready.

1:14:23.268 --> 1:14:25.305
We are going home.

1:17:03.142 --> 1:17:05.179
Please...

1:17:08.100 --> 1:17:10.183
don't die.

1:17:12.475 --> 1:17:14.299
Please.

1:17:18.475 --> 1:17:21.177
Please...

1:17:21.267 --> 1:17:23.304
don't die.

1:17:33.642 --> 1:17:36.177
Don't die, please...

1:17:41.392 --> 1:17:44.259
- Don't die...
- Wake up!

1:17:45.642 --> 1:17:48.924
You can't atone for your sins
with nightmares.

1:17:59.392 --> 1:18:01.429
Bring me my robe.

1:18:01.517 --> 1:18:03.803
Hurry!

1:18:03.892 --> 1:18:05.929
I want my breakfast.

1:18:28.433 --> 1:18:31.679
I couldn't stand those awful hotels
any more.

1:18:32.642 --> 1:18:37.512
I'm too tired to be travelling
around and around.

1:18:38.683 --> 1:18:40.720
And you!

1:18:41.975 --> 1:18:45.803
You are too weak to resist temptation.

1:19:31.558 --> 1:19:33.844
Without me you are nothing.

1:19:34.933 --> 1:19:38.547
No one sees you
and no one notices you.

1:19:38.641 --> 1:19:41.046
Just like your stupid hero.

1:19:46.099 --> 1:19:49.760
Watch it! You're getting me dirty.

1:19:54.391 --> 1:19:58.847
Now we are going
to practice my concerto.

1:20:25.391 --> 1:20:28.342
No grace, no style!

1:20:28.432 --> 1:20:31.216
You've got to move my fingers
more elegantly.

1:20:35.391 --> 1:20:37.428
All right.

1:20:43.974 --> 1:20:47.256
- Start again.
- But I can't do it. I don't remember the melody.

1:20:47.349 --> 1:20:51.970
I know that! At least you remember
the song of our patron saint.

1:20:55.265 --> 1:20:57.338
Come on then, I want to play it.

1:21:05.515 --> 1:21:10.136
El fin del mundo se acerca ya

1:21:11.182 --> 1:21:15.389
Toda esperanza se acabará

1:21:16.307 --> 1:21:21.675
Ya las señales se están cumpliendo

1:21:22.932 --> 1:21:25.846
Se están cumpliendo como escrito está

1:21:27.890 --> 1:21:31.930
Querido amigo, Lirio te llama...

1:21:45.015 --> 1:21:47.966
Y tendrás parte en la resurrección

1:21:48.057 --> 1:21:50.094
Stop it!

1:21:50.182 --> 1:21:53.878
It's always roosters or swans!

1:21:53.973 --> 1:21:58.546
You never see anything else
in your ridiculous hallucinations.

1:22:09.057 --> 1:22:11.094
It's over, Mummy.

1:22:15.390 --> 1:22:17.427
My angel.

1:22:18.598 --> 1:22:20.754
- Now let's sing.
- Aladin.

1:22:32.515 --> 1:22:36.046
Siento en el alma

1:22:38.681 --> 1:22:43.503
Unas ganas inmensas

1:22:44.640 --> 1:22:48.384
De llorar

1:22:49.515 --> 1:22:52.548
Tú me haces falta

1:22:55.348 --> 1:23:00.929
Y juré no decírtelo

1:23:01.014 --> 1:23:03.584
Jamás

1:23:06.056 --> 1:23:09.966
Yo quiero hacerte

1:23:11.806 --> 1:23:15.799
Con mis lágrimas un

1:23:16.723 --> 1:23:19.804
Collar de perlas

1:23:21.806 --> 1:23:24.922
Déjame llorar

1:23:26.973 --> 1:23:30.717
Porque hoy que te perdí

1:23:32.639 --> 1:23:36.335
Queriéndote olvidar

1:23:38.306 --> 1:23:41.753
Me acuerdo más

1:23:41.848 --> 1:23:47.465
De ti

1:26:31.888 --> 1:26:33.925
So you failed again?

1:26:34.013 --> 1:26:36.086
Come here.

1:26:36.180 --> 1:26:38.217
Come here!

1:26:41.388 --> 1:26:43.425
Come!

1:26:58.013 --> 1:27:01.295
I want to finish the stockings
for Santa Lirio.

1:27:16.013 --> 1:27:18.631
One, two, pass.

1:27:19.263 --> 1:27:23.920
One, two, pass. One, two, pass.

1:27:47.721 --> 1:27:52.129
Oh, Mr. Fenix, what a pleasure.

1:27:52.221 --> 1:27:56.925
I... I have the things that you ordered.

1:27:58.679 --> 1:28:00.716
Mercury,

1:28:00.804 --> 1:28:02.841
sulphur,

1:28:02.929 --> 1:28:04.966
boric trisulphate.

1:28:05.054 --> 1:28:11.133
Oh... I'd really like to see
your experiments, Mr. Fenix.

1:28:11.220 --> 1:28:13.424
- Really?
- Yes!

1:28:13.512 --> 1:28:16.924
Why don't you invite me some time?

1:28:17.012 --> 1:28:19.465
We could have dinner...

1:28:21.387 --> 1:28:23.626
How about tonight?

1:28:23.720 --> 1:28:28.293
I'll bring some flowers.
Ten o'clock all right?

1:28:28.387 --> 1:28:30.673
Yes, I guess so. I have to go now.
Thank you.

1:28:30.762 --> 1:28:33.250
Ladies and gentlemen!

1:28:33.345 --> 1:28:38.582
Coming soon at the Coliseum,
an evening of wrestling!

1:28:38.679 --> 1:28:44.177
Featuring The Saint,
the world's strongest woman!

1:28:44.262 --> 1:28:48.634
Good! The Saint...

1:28:55.845 --> 1:28:58.049
Mr. Fenix!

1:28:59.303 --> 1:29:01.589
Mr. Fenix?

1:29:11.470 --> 1:29:14.752
Mr. Fenix, what's happening to you?

1:29:18.803 --> 1:29:22.168
Nothing. It was just an hallucination.

1:29:30.053 --> 1:29:34.509
Eh, bonita, no tiene nada para mí?
Venga! Eh!

1:29:34.595 --> 1:29:36.632
Culito.

1:29:53.386 --> 1:29:56.585
Qué? Una foto?
No, no.

1:29:56.678 --> 1:29:58.715
No... No?

1:29:58.803 --> 1:30:03.010
Pobrecita.
Espere. Una foto.

1:30:04.261 --> 1:30:06.749
There.

1:30:07.845 --> 1:30:09.882
Bueno.

1:30:37.969 --> 1:30:41.002
How great is that?
The audience will buy it.

1:30:51.594 --> 1:30:54.508
The next trick, attack and defence.

1:31:20.927 --> 1:31:24.173
That's it for today.
They can hit the showers.

1:32:35.843 --> 1:32:38.461
What are you doing here?

1:32:44.302 --> 1:32:46.339
You're very nice.

1:32:46.427 --> 1:32:48.500
What's the matter?

1:32:51.635 --> 1:32:53.672
Don't you like me?

1:32:54.843 --> 1:32:56.880
Yes.

1:32:56.968 --> 1:33:01.175
I like you so much
that I would like to have you in my show.

1:33:01.260 --> 1:33:04.423
Do you have
your own company or theatre?

1:33:04.510 --> 1:33:06.796
A little theatre in my house.

1:33:10.718 --> 1:33:14.000
Would you like to take me there tonight?

1:33:14.093 --> 1:33:16.130
For a quick rehearsal?

1:33:18.135 --> 1:33:21.998
- If it's not asking too much.
- Hey, I like you.

1:33:23.010 --> 1:33:25.166
You got a bottle on you, baby?

1:33:28.218 --> 1:33:30.255
Nice.

1:34:41.843 --> 1:34:43.880
Careful, Saint.

1:35:01.967 --> 1:35:04.004
This is my theatre.

1:35:10.551 --> 1:35:13.916
I like this strong
and beautiful body of yours...

1:35:17.967 --> 1:35:20.171
that could fight me off.

1:35:21.176 --> 1:35:24.506
Why should I, sugar? Mm?

1:35:26.176 --> 1:35:29.623
Fenix? Where are you?

1:35:30.634 --> 1:35:32.707
What's the matter with you?

1:35:33.800 --> 1:35:36.335
Nothing. It was only my imagination.

1:35:56.092 --> 1:35:58.378
Ladies and... Ladies.

1:35:59.467 --> 1:36:01.753
The show is about to begin!

1:36:02.675 --> 1:36:05.128
Come, Lothar.

1:36:22.550 --> 1:36:26.294
You are about to witness
the ultimate miracle.

1:36:26.383 --> 1:36:30.376
The transformation of death into life.

1:36:39.967 --> 1:36:45.584
I will change this mummy
into one hundred flying doves!

1:37:31.383 --> 1:37:33.420
Watch out, Saint!

1:37:34.175 --> 1:37:36.841
For now you have to fight me off.

1:37:36.925 --> 1:37:41.665
What's happening to you?
Are you going crazy?

1:37:41.758 --> 1:37:45.088
Kill her! Kill her!

1:37:46.758 --> 1:37:48.795
Did you hear her?

1:37:48.883 --> 1:37:51.501
She wants me to kill you with my hands.

1:37:51.591 --> 1:37:54.257
Kill her!

1:37:56.674 --> 1:37:58.166
Kill her!

1:38:16.758 --> 1:38:21.628
- Kill her!
- Please...

1:38:21.716 --> 1:38:24.121
break my arms.

1:38:24.216 --> 1:38:26.253
Kill her!

1:39:06.882 --> 1:39:08.919
Crazy fool.

1:39:15.507 --> 1:39:17.793
Use the sword.

1:43:04.172 --> 1:43:07.205
Why did you...?

1:43:44.880 --> 1:43:46.917
Forgive me.

1:43:51.880 --> 1:43:54.794
Please, forgive me.

1:43:59.505 --> 1:44:01.542
What have I done?

1:44:50.421 --> 1:44:52.458
Alma.

1:45:01.504 --> 1:45:03.992
I have been waiting for you...

1:45:05.171 --> 1:45:07.208
for so long.

1:46:06.087 --> 1:46:08.124
You've come...

1:46:08.212 --> 1:46:12.075
to take me... away?

1:46:54.337 --> 1:46:56.374
Fenix!

1:46:58.170 --> 1:47:01.416
You will never take my son
away from me!

1:47:03.045 --> 1:47:05.367
I order my hands to kill her!

1:47:29.920 --> 1:47:31.957
No!

1:47:32.462 --> 1:47:34.499
Yes!

1:47:34.587 --> 1:47:36.624
Cut off her arms!

1:48:22.336 --> 1:48:24.871
Cut off her arms!

1:48:29.753 --> 1:48:31.790
Is anybody home?

1:48:32.711 --> 1:48:35.495
Mr. Fenix? Mr. Fenix!

1:48:48.753 --> 1:48:50.790
Somebody help me!

1:48:54.378 --> 1:48:57.126
No!

1:48:57.211 --> 1:48:59.248
Kill her!

1:48:59.336 --> 1:49:02.997
Yes! Kill her!

1:49:03.086 --> 1:49:05.123
- Kill her!
- No!

1:49:05.211 --> 1:49:06.703
Kill her!

1:49:08.336 --> 1:49:10.373
Kill her! Kill her!

1:49:11.294 --> 1:49:14.161
Kill her! Kill her!

1:49:15.586 --> 1:49:18.916
Kill her! Kill her!

1:49:19.003 --> 1:49:21.573
Cut off her arms!

1:49:21.669 --> 1:49:24.951
Cut off her arms!
Cut off her arms!

1:49:25.044 --> 1:49:27.449
Cut off her arms!

1:49:30.377 --> 1:49:34.322
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

1:49:34.419 --> 1:49:36.456
Kill her!

1:49:38.627 --> 1:49:42.869
Cut them off!

1:49:56.461 --> 1:49:59.375
Now get out of my life!

1:50:00.586 --> 1:50:02.955
Disappear!

1:50:06.377 --> 1:50:08.581
You will never be free of me!

1:50:08.669 --> 1:50:10.706
I'm inside of you!

1:50:55.710 --> 1:50:58.542
Yo ya me voy...

1:50:58.627 --> 1:51:00.664
Mother.

1:51:01.293 --> 1:51:07.704
Al puerto donde se haya

1:51:10.543 --> 1:51:15.496
La barca de oro

1:51:17.835 --> 1:51:22.326
Que debe conducirme

1:51:22.418 --> 1:51:25.285
Yo ya me voy...

1:51:25.377 --> 1:51:27.414
My mummy is dead.

1:51:29.335 --> 1:51:35.449
Sólo vengo a despedirme

1:51:38.001 --> 1:51:42.457
Adiós mujer

1:51:44.251 --> 1:51:49.998
Adiós para siempre, adiós

1:51:51.626 --> 1:51:55.833
No volverán

1:51:57.126 --> 1:52:03.371
Tus ojos a mirarme

1:52:05.543 --> 1:52:10.072
Ni tus oídos

1:52:12.335 --> 1:52:16.743
Escucharán mi canto

1:52:16.835 --> 1:52:19.121
Voy a aumentar...

1:52:19.210 --> 1:52:21.330
No. No.

1:52:22.334 --> 1:52:27.749
Los mares con mi llanto

1:52:30.876 --> 1:52:35.995
Adiós mujer

1:52:37.251 --> 1:52:42.370
Adiós para siempre, adiós

1:52:58.126 --> 1:53:02.699
Yo quiero hacerte

1:53:04.126 --> 1:53:08.166
Con mis lágrimas un

1:53:09.334 --> 1:53:12.781
Collar de perlas

1:53:14.042 --> 1:53:17.454
Déjame llorar

1:53:19.334 --> 1:53:23.197
Porque hoy que te perdí

1:53:25.126 --> 1:53:28.906
Queriéndote olvidar

1:53:30.792 --> 1:53:39.039
Me acuerdo más de ti

1:53:40.167 --> 1:53:42.999
Hey!

1:53:43.084 --> 1:53:46.531
Ándale, ándale.

1:53:47.959 --> 1:53:49.996
Throw her out the window.

1:53:51.417 --> 1:53:53.621
One!

1:53:53.709 --> 1:53:56.162
And two!

1:53:56.250 --> 1:54:00.113
And three! And four!

1:54:56.250 --> 1:54:59.283
A fire!

1:55:48.875 --> 1:55:50.912
Goodbye!

1:55:57.958 --> 1:55:59.995
Mr. Fenix.

1:56:03.541 --> 1:56:05.578
Aladin.

1:57:50.749 --> 1:57:53.319
Put your hands up!

1:58:06.374 --> 1:58:08.411
My hands...

1:58:10.040 --> 1:58:12.077
My hands!

1:58:13.624 --> 1:58:15.661
My hands.
