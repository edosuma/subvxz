00:26.935 --> 00:27.995
- Hey, they're ready
for you Max.

00:28.030 --> 00:29.200
- Oh, good.

00:29.235 --> 00:31.165
- It is black. Extra strong.
- Thank you.

00:31.201 --> 00:33.470
- Okay. We're on our way.

00:45.448 --> 00:46.885
- Okay, one minute
till we shoot.

00:46.920 --> 00:48.617
Thank you guys. Let's be ready.

00:50.724 --> 00:51.587
- There we go.

00:55.095 --> 00:57.329
- Final check-
- Is this my chair?

00:58.197 --> 01:00.434
- Let's have a red light
bell, please.

01:01.131 --> 01:02.800
- Where's my phone?

01:02.868 --> 01:04.435
Who has my phone?

01:05.066 --> 01:06.173
- Sound.

01:07.772 --> 01:08.670
Camera.

01:10.042 --> 01:10.807
- All right. How's my hair?

01:10.876 --> 01:11.945
How's my hair?

01:11.980 --> 01:12.877
- It's looking good.
Looking good.

01:12.913 --> 01:14.680
- Nice and quiet, please.

01:14.748 --> 01:15.677
Ready for a take.

01:19.281 --> 01:20.320
Cameras are rolling.

01:20.356 --> 01:21.254
Set.

01:22.021 --> 01:23.688
- One take one.
- Mark it.

01:25.955 --> 01:26.820
Quiet.

01:28.630 --> 01:29.823
Stand by and...

01:32.368 --> 01:33.266
Action.

01:34.168 --> 01:37.936
- When I was an atheist,
if you had asked me,

01:37.971 --> 01:39.834
why do you not believe in God?

01:40.804 --> 01:45.308
I would've answered, look
at the universe we live in.

01:45.343 --> 01:48.648
Mostly empty space,
completely dark.

01:48.683 --> 01:51.116
Unimaginably cold.

01:51.151 --> 01:52.713
Most scientists
think it improbable

01:52.749 --> 01:55.982
that any planet in our
solar system sustains life

01:56.051 --> 02:00.926
and Earth herself
existed without
life for millions of years

02:00.961 --> 02:02.522
and may exist millions more

02:02.591 --> 02:05.929
after life has once
again left her.

02:05.964 --> 02:08.467
And what is life?

02:08.502 --> 02:12.867
So arranged that creatures live
only by preying on another.

02:13.603 --> 02:16.606
In the lower forms, this
means only death.

02:16.641 --> 02:19.276
In the higher forms something
called consciousness

02:19.311 --> 02:23.278
enables the living to
experience pain.

02:23.313 --> 02:25.217
Creatures are born in pain,

02:25.286 --> 02:30.316
live by inflicting pain
and mostly die in pain.

02:30.851 --> 02:34.388
In the most complex of
all creatures, man,

02:34.423 --> 02:37.196
another quality appears, reason.

02:37.231 --> 02:41.268
And by reason we can foresee
our own pain.

02:42.133 --> 02:43.567
This we call suffering.

02:44.433 --> 02:46.303
We can foresee our own death

02:46.338 --> 02:48.874
while keenly desiring
to go on living.

02:49.543 --> 02:54.047
Reason enables humans to invent
hundreds of ingenious ways

02:54.082 --> 02:56.248
of inflicting a great
deal more pain

02:56.284 --> 02:59.812
than we could have done
as irrational creatures.

02:59.847 --> 03:02.850
This power we have exploited
to the full.

03:02.885 --> 03:07.390
History's our record of
crime, war, disease, terror,

03:07.425 --> 03:09.324
with just enough happiness
to give us

03:09.359 --> 03:11.925
an agonized fear of losing it.

03:13.200 --> 03:16.067
And when lost, the
poignant misery

03:16.102 --> 03:18.932
of remembering how good it felt.

03:23.740 --> 03:26.110
Every now and then our
condition is improved

03:26.145 --> 03:28.948
by what we call civilization.

03:28.983 --> 03:31.748
But all civilizations pass away.

03:31.784 --> 03:35.715
That our own civilization will
pass away is surely probable,

03:35.750 --> 03:38.290
and even if it should
not pass away,

03:38.358 --> 03:41.394
we're all doomed, the
universe is doomed.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.296
The astronomers hold out no hope

03:44.364 --> 03:46.827
that this planet is
permanently inhabitable.

03:46.863 --> 03:49.531
The physicists hold out
no hope that organic life

03:49.567 --> 03:51.838
is a permanent possibility
in any part

03:51.874 --> 03:53.239
of the material universe.

03:53.274 --> 03:56.274
Not only this earth,
but the whole show.

03:56.309 --> 03:59.109
All the suns of space
are to run down.

03:59.145 --> 04:02.580
Nature is a sinking ship.

04:04.046 --> 04:07.947
So if you asked me to believe
all this I've just described

04:07.982 --> 04:10.858
as the work of an
omnipotent, benevolent God,

04:10.926 --> 04:12.456
I would have laughed and said

04:12.492 --> 04:14.755
the evidence points in
the opposite direction.

04:14.790 --> 04:17.064
Either there's no God
behind the universe,

04:17.099 --> 04:19.866
a God indifferent
to good and evil,

04:19.901 --> 04:22.435
or worse, an evil God,

04:23.501 --> 04:25.030
Never dreamed of raising
the question

04:25.066 --> 04:28.505
if the universe is so
bad, or even half so bad,

04:28.574 --> 04:30.507
how on Earth did humans
ever come to attribute

04:30.542 --> 04:33.879
it to the work of a wise
and good creator?

04:33.947 --> 04:35.344
Oh men are fools!

04:35.379 --> 04:36.809
But not so foolish as that,

04:36.844 --> 04:40.087
to direct inference from
black to white,

04:40.122 --> 04:42.453
from evil flower to
virtuous root,

04:42.489 --> 04:46.990
from senseless work to a
workman infinitely wise.

04:47.026 --> 04:48.659
Staggers belief.

04:50.396 --> 04:53.760
No, I did not believe
God existed.

04:53.795 --> 04:55.995
I was angry at God
for not existing.

04:56.064 --> 04:58.666
Why should creatures have
the burden of existence

04:58.701 --> 05:01.005
forced upon them without
their consent?

05:20.061 --> 05:22.493
I lost my mother to cancer.

05:22.528 --> 05:25.063
Had an estranged
relationship with my father

05:25.098 --> 05:26.929
that I regret even now.

05:27.665 --> 05:29.664
Was in the trenches during
the Great War,

05:29.699 --> 05:32.665
the hell where youth
and laughter go

05:32.700 --> 05:35.868
only to see horribly smashed men

05:35.903 --> 05:39.645
still moving about like
crushed beetles.

05:39.680 --> 05:42.410
A mortar shell that wounded
me, killed the man next to me,

05:42.445 --> 05:43.679
splattering shrapnel,

05:43.714 --> 05:47.083
some of which I carry
my body to this day.

05:58.665 --> 06:02.568
When I returned to Oxford
after the war in 1919,

06:02.603 --> 06:06.437
I read the minutes to my
college's last meeting in 1914,

06:06.505 --> 06:09.439
nothing made me realize
more thoroughly

06:09.508 --> 06:12.005
the absolute waste
of those years.

06:12.041 --> 06:15.410
I was asked "Were you much
frightened in France?"

06:15.445 --> 06:17.117
"All the time," I said,

06:17.186 --> 06:19.915
"but I never sank so
low as to pray."

06:21.357 --> 06:23.083
Some people have got the
impression from my books

06:23.118 --> 06:26.518
that I was raised in a
strict and vivid puritanism.

06:26.554 --> 06:27.758
This is untrue.

06:30.194 --> 06:30.996
- Mr. Lewis.

06:31.065 --> 06:32.965
- Roger, usual please.

06:33.001 --> 06:35.901
You? Make that two.

06:35.937 --> 06:36.596
I'll get these.

06:36.632 --> 06:38.203
Edel will find us a table.

06:38.238 --> 06:39.935
- You can have this one.

06:40.668 --> 06:42.069
There you go. All done.

06:43.876 --> 06:47.514
- No, religious experience
did not occur in my family.

06:49.716 --> 06:52.712
Was taught the usual things,
made to say my prayers,

06:52.747 --> 06:54.687
in due time taken to church.

06:55.489 --> 06:57.821
Can't remember feeling
much interest in it.

06:58.760 --> 06:59.658
Cheers!

07:03.695 --> 07:06.597
Father was a solicitor
in Belfast, Ireland.

07:06.633 --> 07:10.796
He was Welsh by blood,
passionate, rhetorical,

07:10.831 --> 07:13.034
laughed and cried a great deal.

07:13.836 --> 07:15.872
Had almost no talent
for happiness.

07:16.705 --> 07:18.342
Mother was of a cooler race.

07:18.410 --> 07:20.647
She was tranquil, affectionate.

07:21.550 --> 07:25.117
She had a talent for happiness.
Went straight for it.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.813
As an experienced traveler

07:26.849 --> 07:28.819
goes for the best
seat on a train.

07:34.429 --> 07:37.425
I lived in a large house
that to a small boy

07:37.461 --> 07:39.060
seemed like a city.

07:45.472 --> 07:48.134
I am a product of
long corridors,

07:48.170 --> 07:53.374
empty sunlit rooms, attics
explored in solitude,

07:54.010 --> 07:58.449
distant noises of gurgling
cisterns and pipes.

07:58.485 --> 08:01.922
The noise of wind
under the tiles

08:01.990 --> 08:03.887
and endless books.

08:06.788 --> 08:10.091
Books readable and unreadable,

08:10.127 --> 08:15.569
books suitable for a child
and books emphatically not.

08:16.434 --> 08:18.470
Nothing was forbidden.

08:18.505 --> 08:22.740
In the seemingly endless
rainy afternoons

08:22.809 --> 08:26.613
I almost literally read
my way through the house.

08:31.182 --> 08:31.910
- Jack.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.917
You'll never guess what I found!

08:34.790 --> 08:35.681
Quick!

08:35.716 --> 08:36.887
- Hey wait for me!

08:37.959 --> 08:38.892
Hey wait!

08:38.927 --> 08:39.890
- Catch up.

08:40.893 --> 08:43.630
- Hey Jack, now stop!
Don't disturb your father!

08:44.327 --> 08:45.225
- Boys!

08:46.967 --> 08:47.865
Boys!

08:51.565 --> 08:52.639
- Boys.

09:02.116 --> 09:02.979
- Happy days.

09:04.620 --> 09:07.918
My brother Warnie and I
enjoyed them to the full.

09:11.119 --> 09:14.056
Until the great loss
that befell our family.

09:16.895 --> 09:20.464
One night, my father in
tears came into my room

09:20.499 --> 09:23.599
to convey to my terrified mind

09:23.634 --> 09:26.002
things I'd never conceived of.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.705
My mother had cancer.

09:28.740 --> 09:29.971
- The doctor
said, we can't-

09:30.007 --> 09:31.269
- I don't
think children suffer

09:31.305 --> 09:34.642
less than their elders,
they suffer differently.

09:34.678 --> 09:36.177
- So we have to be strong.

09:37.213 --> 09:39.947
- And as our
whole existence changed

09:39.982 --> 09:43.390
into something alien
and menacing.

09:43.425 --> 09:45.186
- Your mother loves
you very much.

09:45.221 --> 09:48.827
- The house
became full of strange smells,

09:48.862 --> 09:54.096
midnight noises and sinister
whispered conversations.

10:01.643 --> 10:02.838
- We need some
fresh bandages quickly.

10:02.907 --> 10:04.304
- My brother
Warnie and I

10:04.340 --> 10:07.007
lost our mother gradually
as she was slowly withdrawn

10:07.075 --> 10:10.347
from our life into the
hands of nurses,

10:10.416 --> 10:13.016
delirium and morphea.

10:16.654 --> 10:17.787
- Oh Doctor. Thank goodness.

10:17.856 --> 10:20.254
- The disease followed
the usual course,

10:20.289 --> 10:23.023
an operation, they operated
in the patient's house

10:23.091 --> 10:26.633
in those days, an apparent
recovery,

10:26.669 --> 10:31.738
the return at the disease,
increasing pain, death.

10:35.302 --> 10:38.773
When mother died, all
settled happiness

10:38.808 --> 10:41.715
disappeared from our lives.

10:42.383 --> 10:44.850
A great continent had sunk.

10:45.914 --> 10:48.782
It was only sea and islands now.

11:10.906 --> 11:12.713
My father never recovered.

11:15.047 --> 11:18.950
Under the pressure he spoke
wildly, acted unjustly,

11:19.984 --> 11:22.518
as this unfortunate
man was losing his sons

11:22.554 --> 11:23.856
as well as his wife.

11:25.256 --> 11:28.421
My brother Warnie and I had
already begun to lie to him.

11:29.496 --> 11:30.893
We were two frightened urchins,

11:30.928 --> 11:33.294
huddled for warmth
in a bleak world.

11:36.399 --> 11:39.867
Mother's death occasioned, what
some might say at the time,

11:39.902 --> 11:43.005
my first religious experience.

11:43.041 --> 11:45.445
When my mother's case
was pronounced hopeless

11:45.514 --> 11:47.372
I remembered what I
had been taught,

11:47.408 --> 11:51.212
that prayers offered in
faith would be granted.

11:51.247 --> 11:55.388
Accordingly, I set myself
to produce in prayer

11:55.423 --> 11:57.951
a firm belief for her recovery.

11:57.986 --> 12:00.256
When she died, I shifted ground.

12:00.324 --> 12:05.766
I worked myself into belief
that there was to be a miracle.

12:06.796 --> 12:09.031
Oh, I approached God.

12:09.066 --> 12:12.331
Not as savior or as
judge, but as magician.

12:12.367 --> 12:16.402
I simply wanted him to
restore the status quo.

12:16.437 --> 12:19.906
And when he had done
what was required of him,

12:19.941 --> 12:22.915
he would simply go away.

12:25.915 --> 12:27.817
The prayer hadn't worked.

12:27.886 --> 12:30.422
Oh, I was used to things
not working,

12:30.458 --> 12:31.858
thought no more about it.

12:41.229 --> 12:43.736
Mother's death among
other things,

12:43.771 --> 12:48.133
produced in me a deeply
ingrained pessimism.

12:48.168 --> 12:51.274
Oh, I was by no means unhappy,

12:51.309 --> 12:54.747
but I had definitely formed
the opinion that the universe

12:54.783 --> 12:58.885
in the main was a rather
regrettable institution.

13:07.862 --> 13:12.031
Father's melancholy was
a contributing factor.

13:12.066 --> 13:15.966
A prosperous man who by our
present tax-ridden standards

13:16.001 --> 13:18.632
would be described as
incredibly secure.

13:19.402 --> 13:24.845
Expressed adult life as
one unremitting struggle.

13:29.080 --> 13:31.549
Best one could hope for,
according to him,

13:31.618 --> 13:35.048
was to avoid the workhouse.

13:35.116 --> 13:37.924
This only by extreme exertion.

13:38.927 --> 13:42.054
Never thought to check his
highly colored comments

13:42.089 --> 13:43.356
against the obvious fact

13:43.424 --> 13:46.725
that we were living very
uncomfortable lives.

13:47.761 --> 13:51.237
Temperamental widower still
grieving the loss of his wife

13:51.907 --> 13:55.237
must be very wise to raise
two noisy school boys

13:55.306 --> 13:58.439
who reserve their confidence
only for each other.

13:59.880 --> 14:04.115
The same scene, reenacted
time after time.

14:08.321 --> 14:09.220
- Well?

14:10.189 --> 14:12.484
- When he opened
his mouth to reprove us

14:12.520 --> 14:16.560
he no doubt intended a
short well-chosen appeal

14:16.596 --> 14:18.391
to our common sense.

14:18.459 --> 14:20.932
- Have you nothing to
say in your defense?

14:21.000 --> 14:24.164
- But alas, he had been
a public prosecutor,

14:24.200 --> 14:26.533
long before he had
become a father.

14:26.568 --> 14:31.771
Words came to him and
intoxicated him as they came.

14:32.173 --> 14:35.342
- Never in all my born days

14:35.378 --> 14:39.612
have I come across such
recalcitrant behavior.

14:41.785 --> 14:44.122
Disobedience.

14:45.386 --> 14:49.425
Deliberate disobedience
and willfulness,

14:49.494 --> 14:54.264
such as would dismay the very
founders of our civilization.

14:56.038 --> 14:58.534
- What happened was a small
boy who left the bathroom

14:58.569 --> 15:03.803
in a pickle, found himself
attacked like Cicero
on Catiline.

15:04.639 --> 15:08.881
Simile on simile, rhetorical
question on rhetorical

15:08.916 --> 15:11.243
question, the flash
of an orator's eye,

15:11.278 --> 15:14.713
the gestures, the cadences...

15:15.752 --> 15:17.353
The pauses.

15:19.189 --> 15:21.425
The pauses were the
chief danger.

15:21.460 --> 15:24.927
- Well?

15:24.962 --> 15:27.331
- One was so long

15:27.399 --> 15:31.267
that my brother, assuming the
denunciation to have ended,

15:31.302 --> 15:34.467
humbly picked up his
book and resumed reading,

15:34.503 --> 15:37.637
a gesture which my
father, who had only made

15:37.706 --> 15:41.380
a rhetorical miscalculation
of about a second and a half

15:41.416 --> 15:42.681
described as-

15:42.749 --> 15:46.152
- Cool, premeditated, insolent!

15:46.921 --> 15:49.481
- The disproportion
between the tirades

15:49.516 --> 15:52.823
and what prompted them
was ludicrous.

15:52.858 --> 15:54.693
From the wilderness of words,

15:54.761 --> 15:57.764
emerged ideas I took literally.

15:57.799 --> 16:00.396
- Perhaps I should board
up the house.

16:02.804 --> 16:05.967
Keep you both in school
all year round.

16:06.002 --> 16:07.136
- And that we should be-

16:07.171 --> 16:12.210
- Sent to the colonies
to end in misery

16:12.312 --> 16:17.479
the career of crime on which
you have both already embarked.

16:22.958 --> 16:26.158
- Such was the effect
of my father's rhetoric,

16:27.193 --> 16:30.727
until I began to perceive
him as ridiculous.

16:35.232 --> 16:38.104
At 14, I ceased to
be a Christian.

16:38.838 --> 16:41.041
At that age one barely notices.

16:42.736 --> 16:45.508
At school, all the
teachers and book editors

16:45.543 --> 16:49.147
took it for granted that
religion was some
sort of endemic

16:49.183 --> 16:52.479
nonsense into which
humanity tended to blunder.

16:52.515 --> 16:56.988
In the midst of a
thousand false religions,

16:57.024 --> 17:00.054
stood our own, the thousand
and first,

17:00.089 --> 17:03.063
labeled completely true.

17:04.925 --> 17:10.166
On what grounds I asked, why
was it treated so differently?

17:10.435 --> 17:13.935
I was eager not to, if Adonis
could be explained away,

17:13.971 --> 17:15.941
then why not Christ?

17:16.010 --> 17:19.505
So little by little,
I became an apostate

17:19.540 --> 17:22.715
dropping my faith with
no sense of loss

17:22.750 --> 17:24.414
and with the greatest relief.

17:24.450 --> 17:27.653
Oh, there was no faith, hope
or charity in my religion.

17:27.722 --> 17:29.584
I feared not God, but hell,

17:29.653 --> 17:33.553
and heaven was only the lesser
of two intolerable evils.

17:33.588 --> 17:36.388
Oh, I became a vigorous
debunker and argued

17:36.424 --> 17:38.965
there's no proof
for any religion

17:39.034 --> 17:42.133
and that Christianity
is not even the best.

17:42.168 --> 17:44.897
Religion was invented
to explain things

17:44.932 --> 17:50.138
that terrified primitive man,
thunder, pestilence, snakes.

17:50.374 --> 17:51.871
What could be more natural
than to suppose

17:51.906 --> 17:55.476
they were animated by spirits
and that by singing songs

17:55.545 --> 17:58.581
and making sacrifices,
one might appease them.

17:58.617 --> 18:02.614
Great men such as Hercules and
Odin were thought to be gods.

18:02.682 --> 18:05.417
After their death, hence
after the death

18:05.452 --> 18:07.620
of a Hebrew philosopher, Yeshua,

18:07.655 --> 18:10.689
whose name we have corrupted
into Jesus,

18:10.724 --> 18:13.492
a cult sprang up and
Christianity began,

18:13.561 --> 18:16.498
just another mythology
among many.

18:16.567 --> 18:21.601
Oh the superstitions always
held by common people,

18:21.737 --> 18:25.407
but educated thinking was
always stood outside it,

18:25.442 --> 18:30.413
conceding to it only
out of convenience.

18:30.449 --> 18:32.850
And I was not prepared
to believe in a bogey man

18:32.919 --> 18:34.814
who would torture me forever

18:34.883 --> 18:40.325
because I failed to live up
to an impossible standard.

18:50.436 --> 18:53.635
With my deliberate withdrawal
from divine protection,

18:53.670 --> 18:58.208
I underwent a successful
assault of sexual temptation.

18:58.243 --> 19:00.541
Part of it was the
age I had reached.

19:00.609 --> 19:03.544
The electric effect
was a dancing mistress.

19:03.579 --> 19:07.480
She was the first woman
to speak to my blood

19:07.516 --> 19:10.657
whom I looked upon
to lust after.

19:10.692 --> 19:12.286
- Good morning, boys.

19:12.321 --> 19:14.223
- Good morning Miss.

19:14.292 --> 19:16.223
- This was of no fault
of her own.

19:16.258 --> 19:18.064
A gesture, tone of voice

19:18.133 --> 19:21.532
has unpredictable
results in these matters.

19:21.567 --> 19:25.232
As it happened, the school
room was decorated for dance.

19:25.267 --> 19:28.007
She came in and said.

19:28.043 --> 19:32.238
- I love the
smell of bunting.

19:32.274 --> 19:33.444
- And I was undone.

19:35.145 --> 19:36.381
- Now, let us begin.

19:37.818 --> 19:39.615
Follow my every move.

19:40.281 --> 19:41.687
Thank you Elsie.

19:43.656 --> 19:44.554
Up.

19:45.824 --> 19:46.721
And down.

19:48.661 --> 19:49.559
And up.

19:52.293 --> 19:53.930
And dainty toes.

19:53.999 --> 19:55.194
Dainty toes, very good.

19:55.229 --> 19:56.866
Dainty toes.

19:56.902 --> 19:58.436
And around sway.

19:59.738 --> 20:00.636
Sway.

20:03.575 --> 20:06.442
- This was not a knight
devoting himself to a lady,

20:06.511 --> 20:09.176
more like a Turk looking
at a Circassian woman

20:09.212 --> 20:10.815
he could not afford.

20:10.884 --> 20:12.813
I knew what I wanted.

20:18.554 --> 20:20.656
You might think this
produced guilt.

20:21.555 --> 20:25.557
Guilt was not a thing I knew.

20:25.592 --> 20:28.301
- Well done boys. Well done.

20:31.798 --> 20:34.637
- I had been a tender-hearted
boy,

20:34.706 --> 20:39.912
but now I labored hard to
become a fop, a cad, a snob.

20:39.947 --> 20:43.443
I was at that time as non-moral

20:43.478 --> 20:46.652
as a human creature could be.

20:46.687 --> 20:47.650
- Oh Lewis.

20:49.583 --> 20:51.786
Do enjoy the holidays won't you?

20:54.090 --> 20:54.987
- Yes, miss.

21:00.168 --> 21:03.332
- Oh, there you are.
Where have you been?

21:03.401 --> 21:05.004
- Sorry Father.
- Come on, come on.

21:05.073 --> 21:07.872
It won't wait you
know. Thank you.

21:13.676 --> 21:15.176
- I could
not tell my father

21:15.212 --> 21:16.611
my change of belief.

21:16.647 --> 21:19.944
He was no fool. He even
had a streak of genius.

21:19.979 --> 21:22.616
But for a man who was
formidable in court

21:22.651 --> 21:25.917
and I presume efficient
in his office,

21:25.952 --> 21:29.522
he had more power for
confusing an issue

21:29.557 --> 21:32.662
than any man I have ever known.

21:41.901 --> 21:45.340
Oh, the first barrier
to communication

21:45.375 --> 21:48.278
was having asked the question,

21:48.314 --> 21:50.377
he would not stay
for the answer.

21:51.046 --> 21:56.217
Tell him that a boy called
Churchwood had caught a mouse

21:56.286 --> 21:58.757
and kept it as a pet.

21:58.826 --> 22:00.159
He would ask-

22:00.194 --> 22:02.488
- Whatever became of
young Chickweed

22:02.524 --> 22:04.496
who was so afraid of rats?

22:05.161 --> 22:06.058
- Who sir?

22:07.064 --> 22:08.060
- Chickweed.

22:10.402 --> 22:13.466
- Oh, I think you
mean Churchwood.

22:13.502 --> 22:15.936
It was a mouse, not a rat.

22:16.672 --> 22:18.675
And he wasn't afraid
of it, at all.

22:20.273 --> 22:25.351
- Attempts to correct his
version produced an incredulous.

22:25.387 --> 22:30.256
- That's not the story
you used to tell, my boy.

22:30.291 --> 22:33.151
- All this explains,
though does not excuse,

22:33.820 --> 22:37.430
one of the worst
acts of my life.

22:39.895 --> 22:42.961
I allowed myself to
prepare for confirmation.

22:42.996 --> 22:47.103
To be confirmed, make
my first communion,

22:47.172 --> 22:51.236
all in total disbelief,

22:51.271 --> 22:56.713
acting a part, eating and
drinking my own condemnation.

22:57.513 --> 22:59.747
I knew I was acting a lie.

22:59.783 --> 23:04.419
I simply could not tell
my father my real views.

23:04.454 --> 23:06.217
Not that he would have stopped.

23:06.252 --> 23:09.394
Let's talk the whole thing
over, he would have said.

23:09.429 --> 23:11.995
But the thread would
have been lost at once.

23:12.064 --> 23:14.066
His arguments.

23:14.101 --> 23:15.927
I would not have valued a straw,

23:15.962 --> 23:19.300
the beauty of the authorized
version,

23:19.369 --> 23:22.007
the Christian tradition.

23:22.043 --> 23:24.310
Oh, it was all sentiment.

23:24.379 --> 23:29.409
And if I tried to make
by exact points clear,

23:29.811 --> 23:32.283
there would have been
thunder from him

23:32.319 --> 23:34.551
and a thin peevish
rattle from me,

23:34.587 --> 23:38.018
Nor could the subject
ever have been dropped.

23:40.127 --> 23:43.463
All this I ought to have dared

23:44.362 --> 23:47.628
rather than the thing I did.

23:47.664 --> 23:50.833
It seemed impossible
at the time,

23:51.501 --> 23:55.602
cowardice drove me to hypocrisy

23:55.637 --> 23:59.006
and hypocrisy to blasphemy.

24:05.213 --> 24:09.848
The years passed, then the
most fortunate thing happened.

24:09.917 --> 24:11.851
- A bit more to the
right, please.

24:11.886 --> 24:13.688
- My father
had declared

24:13.757 --> 24:16.194
that he would send my
brother to a tutor

24:16.229 --> 24:18.294
in Surrey, south of London.

24:18.329 --> 24:19.530
- That's it. Thank you.

24:19.565 --> 24:21.293
- In a
surprisingly short time,

24:21.328 --> 24:26.171
this tutor had so rebuilt the
ruins of Warnie's education,

24:26.206 --> 24:27.933
that he passed into Sandhurst

24:27.968 --> 24:30.906
and received a prize
army cadetship.

24:32.272 --> 24:36.074
For some time, my own schooling
had been going nowhere.

24:36.110 --> 24:40.218
It had neither engaged
my mind nor my heart,

24:40.286 --> 24:42.552
but seeing my brothers progress,

24:42.621 --> 24:45.190
I finally plucked up
the courage to ask.

24:45.225 --> 24:47.692
- Jack! Jack! Are you up there?

24:52.892 --> 24:55.827
Come on boy. Well get your coat.

24:55.862 --> 24:57.702
We're 10 minutes late already.

25:03.844 --> 25:08.247
- Papa, you know, when
you send Warnie off to Surrey

25:08.283 --> 25:10.346
to your old tutor
Mr. Kirkpatrick.

25:10.382 --> 25:12.010
- Yes.

25:12.045 --> 25:13.916
The Great Knock we
used to call him.

25:13.951 --> 25:16.648
- Warnie seemed to
benefit from him greatly.

25:16.683 --> 25:17.585
- He did.

25:17.620 --> 25:19.086
He did. He's a fine teacher.

25:23.262 --> 25:24.322
- I've been thinking.

25:26.226 --> 25:29.569
Might it not be good to
send me to Surrey too?

25:36.806 --> 25:38.776
- Well, there'll be
no other boys.

25:39.908 --> 25:42.040
You won't be able to
play your games.

25:42.075 --> 25:46.513
- I tried to look grave,
no other boys.

25:46.549 --> 25:48.588
Never to play games.

25:49.518 --> 25:51.789
I was transported.

26:10.309 --> 26:11.642
Ah yes, this is the day

26:11.710 --> 26:14.309
the rest of my life
really began to happen.

26:21.151 --> 26:24.654
I was still in my teens when
I made my way over to England

26:24.723 --> 26:27.858
and down to Surrey to
meet my new tutor.

26:28.526 --> 26:30.489
I wasn't sure what to expect.

26:31.091 --> 26:34.029
At first sight he seemed
decent enough.

26:38.272 --> 26:39.901
- Hello, lovely to meet you.

26:39.936 --> 26:44.138
- William T. Kirkpatrick.
The Great Knock.

26:46.040 --> 26:49.014
- His grip was like
iron pincers.

26:49.049 --> 26:50.045
- Follow me!

26:54.084 --> 26:56.682
- I remember feeling the
need to make conversation

26:56.751 --> 26:57.885
in the deplorable manner

26:57.954 --> 27:00.124
I felt necessary to
use with my father.

27:00.927 --> 27:03.693
- I was quite surprised by
the scenery of Surrey, sir.

27:03.728 --> 27:05.156
It's really much wilder
than I expected.

27:05.225 --> 27:08.067
- Stop! What do you
mean by wildness?

27:08.736 --> 27:11.700
And on what grounds have
you based your expectations?

27:11.736 --> 27:15.340
On the flora and geology
of Surrey?

27:15.375 --> 27:19.077
Was it maps, photographs, books?

27:19.113 --> 27:20.172
- Sorry, sir.

27:20.207 --> 27:23.142
- As answer after answer
was torn to shreds

27:23.178 --> 27:26.549
Kirk concluded that my
comment was meaningless

27:26.617 --> 27:27.948
and that I had no right to have

27:27.983 --> 27:31.018
any opinion whatsoever
on the subject.

27:31.053 --> 27:32.654
It never occurred to
me that my thoughts

27:32.689 --> 27:34.760
needed to be based on anything.

27:36.827 --> 27:40.731
That conversation lasted
three minutes

27:40.799 --> 27:45.133
and set the tone for
my two years in Surrey.

27:45.168 --> 27:50.336
Kirk's ruthless dialectic
was the only way he spoke.

27:52.104 --> 27:54.711
It was an astonishment to Kirk

27:54.746 --> 27:58.080
that you should not want
to be corrected.

27:59.113 --> 28:01.884
Kirk lived with his wife
in a comfortable

28:01.920 --> 28:06.292
and secluded cottage on
the edge of the village.

28:06.327 --> 28:09.491
It was all rather wonderful.

28:09.527 --> 28:11.225
- Welcome! Welcome!

28:11.894 --> 28:13.932
Now you put your
case down there.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.065
- I felt welcomed
as soon as I stepped inside,

28:18.100 --> 28:21.766
the whole place was
stuffed with books.

28:21.835 --> 28:24.442
I had come home.

28:24.477 --> 28:27.206
- And this is my wife, Louisa.

28:27.241 --> 28:29.314
- Pleased to meet you
Mrs. Kirkpatrick.

28:29.383 --> 28:30.107
- Pleasure's ours entirely.

28:30.176 --> 28:31.877
- We'll show you
up to your room.

28:31.913 --> 28:32.980
- I have it all prepared.

28:33.015 --> 28:34.480
- You come down when
you're ready,

28:34.515 --> 28:37.922
and we'll start knocking that
mind of yours into shape.

28:42.629 --> 28:45.160
- There you are. I
hope you like it.

28:48.363 --> 28:51.468
Oh, and by the way, don't
worry about my husband.

28:51.537 --> 28:54.939
He likes to argue, a lot.

28:56.138 --> 28:58.603
- Most boys would have
cowered at all this.

28:58.638 --> 29:03.876
I loved the treat, but it
was red beef and strong beer.

29:03.911 --> 29:05.112
After a few knockdowns,

29:05.147 --> 29:07.886
I began to put on some
intellectual muscle

29:07.921 --> 29:12.187
and became a bit of a sparring
partner to my new tutor.

29:16.656 --> 29:20.995
If I could please myself, I'd
always live as I lived here.

29:21.031 --> 29:24.264
breakfast at eight,
at my desk by nine

29:24.299 --> 29:28.500
to read and write to
precisely one, then lunch.

29:29.905 --> 29:31.135
- That was absolutely delicious.

29:31.170 --> 29:32.341
Thank you, Mrs. Kirkpatrick.

29:32.376 --> 29:33.571
- Fine.

29:33.607 --> 29:37.344
- Oh yes. I was encouraged
to eat, as well as to think.

29:43.053 --> 29:46.153
Off for a walk by two,
not with a friend.

29:46.188 --> 29:48.692
Walking and talking are
two great pleasures,

29:48.761 --> 29:51.158
but it is a mistake
to combine them.

29:51.193 --> 29:54.662
Our noise blocks out
the sounds and silences

29:54.698 --> 29:56.000
of the outer world.

29:57.864 --> 29:58.970
- Thank you.

30:01.070 --> 30:03.138
- My return and the
arrival of tea

30:03.174 --> 30:07.712
would coincide at exactly
four, taken in solitude.

30:07.780 --> 30:10.041
Eating and reading
are two pleasures

30:10.076 --> 30:12.882
that combine admirably.

30:12.951 --> 30:15.816
Work till seven, deep
into the classics,

30:15.851 --> 30:17.890
not sparing the horses.

30:25.666 --> 30:27.894
Good talk all evening,
all challenging,

30:27.929 --> 30:29.868
brain-rattling stuff.

30:29.904 --> 30:32.064
In bed by 11, unless
you're making a night of it

30:32.132 --> 30:34.434
at the pub with your cronies.

30:35.503 --> 30:39.237
- Passable. You're still a
little shaky on accuracy.

30:39.306 --> 30:41.579
And I fear you've
missed my point

30:41.614 --> 30:44.246
about the classics entirely.

30:45.049 --> 30:48.883
He that neither knoweth
nor will be taught

30:48.918 --> 30:51.583
by the instruction of the wise,

30:52.790 --> 30:55.653
this man is not Herodotus.

30:58.564 --> 31:00.097
He knew a thing or two.

31:02.029 --> 31:03.562
- That's not Herodotus.

31:04.832 --> 31:06.667
It's Hesiod.

31:06.702 --> 31:07.936
- Prove it.

31:08.005 --> 31:10.771
- It's from his poem
"Days in work."

31:10.807 --> 31:12.076
I have it somewhere.

31:14.907 --> 31:15.941
Here.

31:15.977 --> 31:18.478
- Good lad!

31:21.282 --> 31:23.914
- My work was mostly
Latin and Greek.

31:24.850 --> 31:30.088
Homer first. Oh still relish
the brightness and music of it.

31:30.190 --> 31:33.163
Then the two great bores,

31:34.165 --> 31:38.033
Cicero and Demosthenes
could not be avoided.

31:38.068 --> 31:42.299
Followed by Lucretius.
Oh, the glory!

31:42.334 --> 31:45.307
Herodotus, Aeschylus, Euripides.

31:46.513 --> 31:47.807
Had no taste for Virgil.

31:48.576 --> 31:51.775
In the evening we mastered
French, Italian and German

31:51.844 --> 31:55.251
plunging into the likes of
Voltaire, Faust in the inferno.

31:57.186 --> 32:01.626
Kirk was my
great teacher.

32:01.661 --> 32:04.459
My debt remains to this day.

32:05.295 --> 32:08.327
As for religion, he was
a Presbyterian atheist.

32:08.396 --> 32:11.135
On Sundays, he gardened
in nicer clothes.

32:15.469 --> 32:19.540
Among the poets I was
reading at the time,

32:20.209 --> 32:25.215
one stood apart, William
Butler Yeats.

32:25.918 --> 32:28.014
He believed that there
was a world

32:28.083 --> 32:29.415
beyond the material curtain

32:29.451 --> 32:33.157
and that contact with
that world was possible.

32:33.193 --> 32:37.490
Oh, I regarded Yeats as a
learned responsible writer.

32:37.559 --> 32:41.027
Later when I met him, I
was awed by his personality

32:41.063 --> 32:42.768
and he rejected the whole

32:42.803 --> 32:46.171
materialist philosophy
out of hand.

32:46.206 --> 32:50.106
If Yeats had been a Christian,
I would have discounted him.

32:50.142 --> 32:54.574
I had Christians placed,
disposed of for ever.

32:55.816 --> 32:59.815
Yeats offered something
else, a perhaps.

32:59.851 --> 33:01.382
And through this perhaps,

33:01.451 --> 33:05.184
a drop of disturbing doubt
fell into my materialism

33:05.219 --> 33:06.724
and introduced me to something

33:06.760 --> 33:08.586
I've had trouble
with ever since,

33:08.621 --> 33:11.896
a ravenous desire for
the supernatural.

33:11.931 --> 33:15.562
Or to put it bluntly,
the occult.

33:26.110 --> 33:29.180
I once tried to describe
it in a novel.

33:29.215 --> 33:33.985
It's a spiritual lust and
like the lust of the flesh

33:34.021 --> 33:36.348
has the fatal power of
making everything else

33:36.384 --> 33:38.684
seem uninteresting
while it lasts.

33:39.957 --> 33:41.993
Oh I loved the vagueness of it.

33:42.028 --> 33:47.265
Circles, pentangles,
Ouija boards, seances,

33:47.835 --> 33:51.436
all seemed able to
raise a spirit.

33:51.472 --> 33:52.897
Oh, this magic!

33:52.965 --> 33:57.440
No connection of my atheism
swayed me in different moods.

33:57.508 --> 34:01.779
And that it was scorned by both
Christians and rationalists

34:01.814 --> 34:04.676
appealed to the rebel in me.

34:04.712 --> 34:10.155
My descent was from
eccentricity to perversity.

34:11.488 --> 34:14.324
The world and the flesh
had made their appearance.

34:14.958 --> 34:17.789
Now came the devil.

34:20.198 --> 34:21.929
Had there been an elder
in the neighborhood

34:21.965 --> 34:24.299
who dabbled in dirt,

34:24.367 --> 34:28.302
oh they have a nose for
potential disciples,

34:28.338 --> 34:33.178
I might now be a Satanist
or a maniac.

34:35.180 --> 34:40.119
Then, in the super abundance
of mercy,

34:41.416 --> 34:43.920
came that event which
I have attempted

34:43.955 --> 34:46.686
to describe in many of my books.

34:52.329 --> 34:54.629
I was in the habit of
walking a few miles

34:54.664 --> 34:59.138
to Leatherhead Station and
taking the train back to Kirk's.

35:04.440 --> 35:06.979
While waiting for the
train I rummaged in

35:07.014 --> 35:09.808
the second hand bookstore
and picked out

35:09.843 --> 35:15.286
an unusual title, "Phantastes"
by George MacDonald.

35:17.120 --> 35:19.489
It looked a little unusual.

35:20.492 --> 35:25.527
I hadn't the faintest notion
of what I'd let myself in for.

35:26.897 --> 35:27.798
- This one please.

35:27.834 --> 35:30.169
- A tuppence, please sir.

35:31.568 --> 35:35.303
Thank you very much sir.

35:35.338 --> 35:40.575
- Sorry.

35:55.493 --> 35:59.162
- As I began to read my new
book, I was electrified.

35:59.197 --> 36:02.232
I felt like a miner who
had struck gold.

36:02.267 --> 36:05.230
In those pages I met
all that had charmed me

36:05.299 --> 36:07.531
in Yeats and others.

36:07.566 --> 36:09.470
Yet, everything was changed.

36:09.505 --> 36:12.040
The bright shadow coming
out of this book,

36:12.075 --> 36:13.837
transformed everything

36:13.872 --> 36:17.381
and it would affect my
own writing forever.

36:19.119 --> 36:21.478
It was as if I had died
in the old country

36:21.514 --> 36:23.354
and come alive in the new,

36:23.389 --> 36:28.359
all my occult and erotic
fantasies began to feel sordid.

36:28.394 --> 36:33.427
Disarmed, what I really
wanted was just out of reach.

36:33.495 --> 36:36.200
Not because of something
I could not do,

36:36.236 --> 36:40.072
but because of something
I could not stop doing.

36:40.107 --> 36:44.870
Oh, if I could only let
go, unmake myself.

36:46.575 --> 36:49.776
I did not know the name
of this new quality.

36:51.048 --> 36:54.253
Oh I do now. Holiness.

36:55.385 --> 36:58.219
That night as I read
"Phantastes"

36:58.254 --> 37:01.821
my imagination was baptized.

37:05.131 --> 37:07.398
The rest of me took
a little longer.

37:13.604 --> 37:15.935
I first met it as a memory
that would arise suddenly

37:16.003 --> 37:20.840
without warning from the depth
of not years, but centuries.

37:23.345 --> 37:26.151
The memory was from childhood

37:26.220 --> 37:29.618
when my brother brought
the lid of a biscuit tin

37:29.653 --> 37:34.225
garnished with twigs and
flowers to make a toy garden.

37:34.260 --> 37:38.330
It was the first beauty
I had ever known,

37:39.030 --> 37:41.599
a sensation of desire.

37:42.402 --> 37:45.896
But before I knew what I
desired, the desire was gone,

37:45.931 --> 37:49.374
withdrawn, the world
turned common again.

37:51.642 --> 37:56.346
Since then my constant
endeavor was to get it again,

37:56.414 --> 37:59.846
in reading every book,
going on every walk,

38:00.516 --> 38:04.318
listening to every
piece of music.

38:04.353 --> 38:07.822
Occasionally the sky would turn.

38:07.890 --> 38:13.332
Far more often, I frightened
it away by my greed to have it.

38:19.972 --> 38:22.000
I call this desire, joy,

38:23.210 --> 38:25.108
which must be distinguished
very sharply

38:25.143 --> 38:26.541
from happiness or pleasure,

38:26.610 --> 38:30.375
except that anyone who
has ever experienced joy

38:30.444 --> 38:32.513
will want it again.

38:32.548 --> 38:34.380
Apart from that, it
might be called

38:34.449 --> 38:37.917
a particular kind of grief,

38:39.454 --> 38:40.952
but then it's the kind we want.

38:40.987 --> 38:45.430
It is the scent of a
flower we have not found,

38:46.562 --> 38:50.435
the echo of a tune
we've not heard.

38:51.734 --> 38:56.408
News from a country we
have not yet visited.

38:57.410 --> 39:00.874
Oh, I doubt that anyone
who has ever tasted joy

39:02.043 --> 39:06.011
would exchange it for all
the pleasures in the world.

39:07.849 --> 39:12.787
But joy is never in our
path. And pleasure is.

39:20.495 --> 39:23.566
At 18, I arrived at Oxford,

39:23.602 --> 39:27.335
the fabled cluster of
towers and dreaming spires

39:27.370 --> 39:30.036
had never looked more beautiful.

39:30.972 --> 39:34.974
Less than a term later,
like most of my generation,

39:35.674 --> 39:37.248
I enlisted in the army,

39:37.283 --> 39:39.550
was sent to the front
lines in France,

39:40.284 --> 39:43.114
on my 19th birthday to be exact.

39:45.721 --> 39:49.995
First bullet I heard
brought not fear,

39:50.063 --> 39:54.263
but the thought, this is war.

39:54.298 --> 39:56.666
This is what Homer wrote about.

39:57.635 --> 40:01.638
Five months later, I was
wounded and sent home.

40:02.372 --> 40:04.075
In between, I had the good luck

40:04.110 --> 40:05.972
to fall sick with trench fever.

40:09.709 --> 40:11.481
Compared to the trenches,

40:11.549 --> 40:15.080
a hospital bed and a
book were heaven itself.

40:17.688 --> 40:19.649
- And how are you
tonight Lieutenant Lewis?

40:19.718 --> 40:21.593
- Fine. Thank you nurse.

40:22.463 --> 40:25.764
- Well Stanley. Time for
your inspection, I think.

40:25.799 --> 40:26.526
- Yes nurse.

40:26.561 --> 40:27.959
- Except that the night nurse

40:27.995 --> 40:31.796
was conducting a furious
affair with my roommate.

40:31.832 --> 40:34.573
I was too sick to
be embarrassed,

40:34.608 --> 40:38.972
but the sound of two lovers
whispering in the nighttime

40:39.947 --> 40:42.173
is a tedious noise.

40:44.981 --> 40:49.054
It was here I first read G.K
Chesterton. Never heard of him.

40:49.122 --> 40:50.820
Had no idea what he stood for,

40:50.855 --> 40:54.191
nor could I understand why it
made such a conquest of me.

40:54.226 --> 40:55.955
His humor was the kind I like.

40:55.990 --> 40:59.998
No, not jokes, still
less a tone of flippancy.

41:00.033 --> 41:02.194
Oh that I cannot endure.

41:03.030 --> 41:08.000
Rather his humor was the
bloom of his argument.

41:08.069 --> 41:11.005
Strange as it seems I
liked him for his goodness.

41:11.040 --> 41:15.240
Oh not that it had anything
to do with being good myself.

41:15.275 --> 41:19.545
I did not have the cynics nose
for hypocrisy and smugness

41:19.581 --> 41:22.216
so common among my peers.

41:29.496 --> 41:32.362
In Chesterton, as in
MacDonald, I did not know

41:32.398 --> 41:34.327
what I was letting
myself in for.

41:34.997 --> 41:38.336
A young man who wishes
to remain a sound atheist

41:38.371 --> 41:40.572
cannot be too careful
of his reading.

41:43.776 --> 41:48.107
After my convalescence, I
returned to the front lines.

42:07.361 --> 42:08.259
- Wait.

42:16.773 --> 42:17.975
- Turn off the light!

42:31.790 --> 42:36.457
The moment I was hit and
found that I was not breathing

42:36.493 --> 42:38.927
I concluded this is death.

42:39.995 --> 42:44.295
I felt no fear, no
courage, just the thought,

42:45.337 --> 42:48.673
here lies a man who died.

42:49.638 --> 42:51.770
It wasn't even interesting.

42:51.805 --> 42:53.169
The fruit of this experience

42:53.205 --> 42:56.206
is there appeared a
fully conscious I,

42:56.242 --> 43:00.047
whose connection with
me was coming to an end.

43:00.082 --> 43:04.953
And I, whoever that may be,
cared not two farthings.

43:05.722 --> 43:08.022
Oh, it was more than
an abstraction.

43:09.523 --> 43:10.456
I tasted it.

43:17.562 --> 43:22.135
As for the rest of the war,
the cold, the fear, the fright.

43:24.076 --> 43:25.336
The corpses.

43:27.307 --> 43:31.177
It was a ghastly interruption
to rational life.

43:33.147 --> 43:36.655
Now it feels like it
happened to someone else.

43:39.118 --> 43:41.726
Except for the recurring
nightmares.

43:51.770 --> 43:56.101
When I returned to Oxford,
I put on a new look,

43:56.137 --> 43:59.238
which meant to act with
the greatest good sense,

43:59.273 --> 44:03.847
and to have no more flirtations
with the supernatural.

44:07.081 --> 44:10.182
Directly after the war,
I spent a fortnight

44:10.251 --> 44:13.887
with a man I'd dearly
loved, who was going mad.

44:13.956 --> 44:16.957
I held him as he wallowed
on the floor

44:16.992 --> 44:21.232
and screamed "Devils are
tearing me apart.

44:21.267 --> 44:24.268
I'm falling into hell."

44:24.337 --> 44:25.899
I knew this man had flirted

44:25.934 --> 44:29.067
with all sorts of occult
ideas as I had.

44:29.135 --> 44:31.842
Oh, perhaps there was
no connection,

44:31.878 --> 44:35.880
but I took it as a warning
to stay on the beaten track,

44:35.915 --> 44:41.115
the approved material center
of the road with the lights on.

44:45.219 --> 44:47.989
The early days of my new
look were quite happy,

44:48.025 --> 44:52.058
busy engaged in my studies
of classics, philosophy.

44:52.093 --> 44:54.297
At that time we were all
swept up by Freud

44:54.366 --> 44:56.901
and his new psychology.

44:56.936 --> 45:01.870
By my mid 20s, I was elected
a fellow at Magdalen College,

45:01.905 --> 45:04.435
hence my career as a
scholar and tutor began.

45:05.773 --> 45:07.007
- After you dear boy.

45:07.043 --> 45:08.876
- The answer of course,
is that .

45:08.912 --> 45:11.109
- They even provided
rooms for me here,

45:11.177 --> 45:14.379
to read, to write
for my tutorials.

45:15.881 --> 45:17.217
I had arrived.

45:19.722 --> 45:21.056
I felt like I'd found a home

45:21.091 --> 45:23.892
with some of the finest
scholars I would ever meet.

45:23.927 --> 45:27.932
We were young, clear-headed,
invincible.

45:28.802 --> 45:32.431
Then one day, my very dear
friend, Owen Barfield,

45:32.499 --> 45:36.201
who satisfied my hunger for
debate and rational opposition

45:36.236 --> 45:39.811
announced that he had
changed his views.

45:40.979 --> 45:45.980
He was no longer a materialist
and had become a theist.

45:46.015 --> 45:48.619
I was shocked. I thought
Barfield was safe.

45:48.655 --> 45:50.918
He came from such a free-thinkig
family.

45:50.953 --> 45:53.658
He'd barely even heard
of Christianity.

45:53.693 --> 45:56.327
Barfield bought up all
the abominations:

45:56.362 --> 45:59.058
God, spirit, afterlife.

45:59.093 --> 46:02.765
I said, "Dammit Owen,
it's medieval."

46:02.800 --> 46:05.430
- Dammit Owen,
it's medieval.

46:07.204 --> 46:09.274
- You may say that
Jack, but the medieval world

46:09.309 --> 46:10.436
has a lot to teach us.

46:11.139 --> 46:13.777
- You mean that
the world is flat.

46:13.813 --> 46:16.947
- Oh come on Jack, be
serious. Open your mind.

46:18.317 --> 46:19.577
- I have.

46:19.612 --> 46:23.487
And as a wise man once said to
me, he that neither knoweth-

46:23.522 --> 46:25.549
- This started our great war,

46:25.584 --> 46:28.959
our philosophic disputation
that lasted for years.

46:29.990 --> 46:32.125
I remember Barfield asking:

46:32.161 --> 46:35.697
- Jack, do you believe
that logic and reason

46:35.765 --> 46:37.465
bring forth indisputable truth?

46:37.501 --> 46:38.703
- I do.

46:38.771 --> 46:39.997
- And are your moral
and aesthetic judgments

46:40.032 --> 46:41.403
valid and meaningful?

46:41.438 --> 46:42.706
- They are.

46:42.775 --> 46:45.305
- Well then materialism
must be abandoned.

46:45.340 --> 46:47.338
There is a hopeless discord
between what our minds

46:47.373 --> 46:49.941
claim to be and what
they really must be

46:49.976 --> 46:51.676
if materialism is true.

46:52.345 --> 46:56.017
We claim our minds to
be reason-perceiving

46:56.053 --> 46:58.114
universal intellectual
principles, moral laws,

46:58.150 --> 46:59.990
and possessing free will.

47:00.026 --> 47:03.223
But if materialism is true,
our minds must in reality,

47:03.292 --> 47:06.563
be merely chance arrangements
of atoms in skulls.

47:06.598 --> 47:07.964
- I of course, argued back.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.528
- We are to accept reality
as it is revealed to us

47:10.597 --> 47:14.739
by our senses and the findings
of science have concluded

47:14.774 --> 47:17.003
that human reason is merely
cognitive maps

47:17.039 --> 47:18.369
resulting from natural
selection,

47:18.438 --> 47:22.076
with random mutations
over millions of years

47:22.112 --> 47:24.447
to confer on humans a
reproductive advantage

47:24.516 --> 47:25.950
over other species.

47:27.113 --> 47:28.885
- I had to say something.

47:28.920 --> 47:32.387
I'd been defending materialism
for years.

47:32.422 --> 47:33.287
- Look.

47:34.627 --> 47:36.455
If my clearest reasoning
tells me

47:36.491 --> 47:39.393
that my mind is nothing more
than the accidental result

47:39.428 --> 47:43.867
of atoms colliding in skulls,
there must be some mistake.

47:43.903 --> 47:46.367
How should I trust my
mind when it tells me

47:46.402 --> 47:49.772
that my most profound thoughts
are merely mental patterns

47:49.841 --> 47:52.075
resulting from heredity
and physics?

47:55.046 --> 47:58.748
- Barfield's notion that
if materialism is true

47:58.784 --> 48:01.211
my conscious mind
is nothing more

48:01.246 --> 48:04.153
than atoms colliding in skulls.

48:06.352 --> 48:08.518
This was simply unbelievable
to me.

48:08.553 --> 48:11.589
I could not force my
thought into that shape

48:11.624 --> 48:15.129
any more than I could scratch
my ear with my big toe.

48:15.164 --> 48:18.869
It was as final as a
physical impossibility.

48:18.904 --> 48:22.773
Mind, reason, imagination,
consciousness

48:22.808 --> 48:25.136
must be more than mere
biochemistry.

48:25.204 --> 48:28.371
It must be a real participation.

48:28.407 --> 48:32.347
Something further
up, further in.

48:33.116 --> 48:38.319
Rock-bottom reality had
to be intelligent.

48:41.521 --> 48:44.089
It's astonishing I've
not seen this before.

48:44.124 --> 48:46.295
Willful blindness, I suppose.

48:46.330 --> 48:50.329
And I was careful not to attach
rock-bottom reality to God,

48:50.398 --> 48:54.168
my skepticism would not
allow me to go that far.

48:54.203 --> 48:57.437
Rather I attached it
to the universe itself.

48:59.777 --> 49:02.177
Still it had immense potency.

49:02.246 --> 49:06.183
Behind the material curtain
lay the hidden glory.

49:06.218 --> 49:10.153
Barfield and I began to talk
religiously about an absolute.

49:11.255 --> 49:13.490
Of course, this was a
religion that cost nothing.

49:13.526 --> 49:15.558
It wasn't personal.

49:15.627 --> 49:16.652
It wouldn't do anything.

49:16.688 --> 49:19.663
It wouldn't lead to dark
places where men scream

49:19.698 --> 49:21.494
they're being dragged into hell.

49:22.435 --> 49:23.659
It was there.

49:23.695 --> 49:27.698
Never come here. Make
a nuisance of itself.

49:31.604 --> 49:35.505
Within the faculty, I
befriended Hugo Dyson

49:35.540 --> 49:40.084
and J.R.R. Tolkien,
both Christians.

49:41.252 --> 49:44.347
Oh these queer people were
popping up on every side.

49:44.382 --> 49:46.351
There was a wider disturbance.

49:46.387 --> 49:48.484
All my books were turning
against me.

49:48.520 --> 49:50.353
I must've been as
blind as a bat,

49:50.388 --> 49:51.855
not to have seen this before.

49:51.890 --> 49:55.166
George McDonald had done more
to me than any other writer.

49:55.201 --> 49:58.734
Of course he had that bee in
his bonnet about Christianity.

49:58.803 --> 50:00.871
He was good in spite of it.

50:00.906 --> 50:04.007
Spenser, Dante, Milton
had it too.

50:04.043 --> 50:06.809
I thought Chesterton the
most sensible man alive,

50:06.844 --> 50:09.078
apart from his Christianity.

50:09.113 --> 50:10.915
I was beginning to think
that Christianity

50:10.984 --> 50:14.416
was quite sensible apart
from its Christianity.

50:14.451 --> 50:18.156
On the other hand, those writers
who did not suffer religion

50:18.191 --> 50:21.092
and with whom my sympathies
ought to have been complete:

50:21.127 --> 50:26.096
Shaw, Wells, Gibbon,
Voltaire, seemed thin, tinny.

50:26.132 --> 50:28.993
Oh, they were all entertaining,
especially Gibbon,

50:29.029 --> 50:30.196
but hardly more.

50:30.232 --> 50:32.197
The roughness and
density of life

50:32.232 --> 50:34.702
did not appear in their books.

50:35.505 --> 50:38.569
I concluded that those with
untrained philosophic minds

50:38.638 --> 50:41.007
could come near the notion
of an absolute being

50:41.042 --> 50:43.013
by believing in a God.

50:43.048 --> 50:45.244
And I distinguished my
belief very sharply

50:45.280 --> 50:47.082
from the God of popular
religion.

50:47.117 --> 50:49.115
Oh there was no possibility
of being

50:49.183 --> 50:50.848
in a personal relation with him.

50:50.884 --> 50:55.056
I could no more meet him than
Hamlet could meet Shakespeare.

50:55.092 --> 50:57.121
And I did not call
him God, either.

50:57.157 --> 50:58.963
I called him Spirit.

50:58.998 --> 51:01.858
One must fight for one's
remaining comforts.

51:04.069 --> 51:06.432
About this time one of
my fellow tutors,

51:06.467 --> 51:08.601
the hardest boiled atheist
I'd ever known,

51:08.670 --> 51:12.110
sat in my rooms other side
of the fireplace and remarked

51:12.145 --> 51:16.041
"The evidence for the
historicity of the gospels,

51:16.076 --> 51:17.477
surprisingly good.

51:17.546 --> 51:21.085
Rum thing, all that mythology
about the dying god.

51:21.121 --> 51:24.815
Rum thing, looks as if
it really happened once."

51:25.756 --> 51:26.654
I was shattered.

51:27.357 --> 51:29.420
If he the cynic of
cynics, who's never since

51:29.456 --> 51:31.326
shown any interest
in Christianity

51:31.395 --> 51:34.532
were not as I still would
have thought him, safe,

51:34.567 --> 51:36.431
where can I turn?

51:41.004 --> 51:42.701
Before God closed in on me

51:43.571 --> 51:46.473
I was in fact offered a
moment of free choice.

51:46.509 --> 51:49.078
I was sitting on a bus
going up Headington Hills

51:49.113 --> 51:50.847
thinking I was wearing
a suit of armor,

51:50.882 --> 51:53.017
trying to keep something out.

51:53.052 --> 51:56.451
I could unbuckle the armor
or, keep it on.

51:57.152 --> 51:58.783
The choice felt momentous.

52:00.759 --> 52:01.786
I chose to unbuckle.

52:03.128 --> 52:05.522
Did not seem impossible
to do the opposite.

52:05.591 --> 52:07.858
The initiative did
not lie with me.

52:10.729 --> 52:12.629
If Hamlet and Shakespeare
could ever meet,

52:12.665 --> 52:14.631
it would have to be Shakespeares
doing,

52:14.666 --> 52:17.571
he could write himself
into the play.

52:21.541 --> 52:24.444
What I called Spirit
began to show

52:24.479 --> 52:27.380
an alarming tendency
to become personal.

52:27.449 --> 52:30.447
Into my mind, crept
a horrible novelty.

52:30.482 --> 52:32.154
I really believed something.

52:32.190 --> 52:34.223
And now that I had blundered
into that

52:34.292 --> 52:37.060
I knew I could play at
philosophy no longer.

52:37.128 --> 52:39.730
It was time something
should be done.

52:39.766 --> 52:42.364
The absolute had arrived.

52:42.399 --> 52:45.235
Making a nuisance of
itself, issuing a command.

52:45.271 --> 52:48.205
All my acts and desires
were to be brought in line

52:48.240 --> 52:51.374
with this absolute spirit
that I now believed.

52:55.146 --> 52:57.914
For the first time
I examined myself

52:57.950 --> 53:00.449
with a serious practical
purpose.

53:01.447 --> 53:04.618
What I found appalled me.

53:05.817 --> 53:09.587
Depth after depth of
pride, self admiration,

53:09.655 --> 53:12.789
a zoo of lusts, a bedlam
of ambitions,

53:12.825 --> 53:17.262
a nursery of fears, a
harem of fondled hatred.

53:17.297 --> 53:19.369
Oh, my name is legion.

53:20.736 --> 53:24.605
Amiable agnostics
talk cheerfully
of man's search for God,

53:24.640 --> 53:27.507
may as well talk of the
mouse's search for the cat.

53:27.543 --> 53:29.879
All I ever wanted was
not be interfered with,

53:29.914 --> 53:32.214
to call my soul my own.

53:32.249 --> 53:35.583
Keep out, private. This
is my business.

53:35.619 --> 53:39.081
But no one talked glibly of
the comforts of religion.

53:39.150 --> 53:42.686
Is it a small thing to give
yourself blindly to a guide

53:42.721 --> 53:44.392
when his own showing
may very well

53:44.428 --> 53:47.195
be leading you to
poverty, ridicule, death?

53:47.231 --> 53:49.461
Oh, I knew I would
not allow myself

53:49.530 --> 53:51.967
to do anything intolerably
painful.

53:52.002 --> 53:53.298
I would be reasonable.

53:53.333 --> 53:55.669
Would it be reasonable?

53:57.877 --> 53:59.442
No assurance was offered.

54:00.274 --> 54:01.675
It was all or nothing.

54:03.580 --> 54:07.285
As the dry bones shook in
Ezekiel's dreadful valley,

54:08.319 --> 54:11.647
the absolute spirit
began to stir and heave

54:11.682 --> 54:13.918
and throw off its grave clothes.

54:14.992 --> 54:19.693
He said, "I am the Lord.

54:21.360 --> 54:22.795
I am that I am.

54:24.999 --> 54:25.930
I am."

54:34.908 --> 54:37.777
You must picture me alone
in my room at Magdalen,

54:39.781 --> 54:43.151
night after night, feeling
whenever my mind lifted,

54:43.186 --> 54:45.353
even for a second, from my work,

54:45.388 --> 54:49.357
the steady unrelenting
approach of him

54:49.426 --> 54:52.891
whom I so earnestly desired
not to meet.

54:56.667 --> 55:00.734
That which I greatly feared
had at last come found me.

55:04.308 --> 55:09.545
In the Trinity term,
1929, I gave in.

55:12.347 --> 55:14.778
And admitted that God is God.

55:14.813 --> 55:17.619
Knelt and prayed perhaps
that night,

55:17.654 --> 55:22.591
the most dejected, reluctant
convert in all England.

55:32.402 --> 55:34.238
I did not then see
the divine love

55:34.273 --> 55:36.869
that would accept a
prodigal on such terms.

55:37.735 --> 55:39.572
Kicking, struggling, resentful,

55:39.607 --> 55:41.473
darting his eyes in
every direction,

55:41.508 --> 55:43.777
looking for a chance to escape.

55:45.111 --> 55:48.452
The hardness of God is kinder
than the softness of man.

55:50.649 --> 55:54.018
His compulsion is my liberation.

56:11.841 --> 56:14.610
You must understand that the
conversion I just described

56:14.646 --> 56:18.214
was only to theism, pure and
simple, not Christianity.

56:18.250 --> 56:20.009
I knew nothing of
the incarnation,

56:20.045 --> 56:22.746
the God to whom I
surrendered was not human.

56:22.782 --> 56:25.121
I had no belief in
an after life.

56:25.189 --> 56:26.820
That to me, felt like a bribe.

56:28.691 --> 56:30.587
My argument against God
was that the universe

56:30.622 --> 56:32.155
was so cruel and unjust,

56:32.190 --> 56:35.592
but where had I got this
notion of cruel and unjust?

56:35.627 --> 56:36.795
I call a line crooked

56:36.863 --> 56:38.862
because I have some
idea of a straight line.

56:38.898 --> 56:40.864
What was I comparing
the universe with,

56:40.899 --> 56:43.471
when I called it cruel
and unjust.

56:43.506 --> 56:45.804
If the whole universe
has no meaning,

56:45.872 --> 56:49.004
I should never have
known it has no meaning.

56:49.040 --> 56:51.479
All of my reasonable
mind was convinced

56:51.514 --> 56:53.644
that the universe cannot
explain itself,

56:53.712 --> 56:55.315
that God is behind the universe,

56:55.350 --> 56:56.618
that he has purposes.

56:56.653 --> 56:59.819
And is to be obeyed
simply because he is God.

56:59.888 --> 57:02.658
I suppose my religion was
like that of the Jews.

57:07.297 --> 57:09.465
As soon as I became a theist,

57:09.501 --> 57:12.168
I started attending my
parish church on Sunday.

57:12.203 --> 57:13.732
College chapel during the week.

57:13.767 --> 57:15.835
Not because I believed
in Christianity,

57:15.904 --> 57:19.670
but because I thought one
should fly one's flag.

57:27.352 --> 57:29.553
Church was an unattractive
affair.

57:31.920 --> 57:34.950
I like clergy as I like
bears, but I have no more wish

57:34.986 --> 57:37.121
to be in church as
to be in a zoo.

57:40.929 --> 57:45.536
Church to me meant ugly
architecture, bleed music,

57:45.604 --> 57:50.574
bad poetry, hymns are
extremely disagreeable to me.

57:53.943 --> 57:58.708
And the botheration of it
all, the crowds, the notices,

57:58.777 --> 58:01.519
the perpetual organizing.

58:03.952 --> 58:06.249
- Before our final prayer,
a quick announcement,

58:06.284 --> 58:09.852
if you would like to join
Edith on the flower rota,

58:09.887 --> 58:11.728
she's desperate for volunteers,

58:11.763 --> 58:15.360
do please speak to her at the
back by the font afterwards.

58:15.395 --> 58:16.666
Let us pray.

58:17.635 --> 58:20.735
Lighten our darkness,
we beseech thee oh Lord

58:20.771 --> 58:24.734
and by thy great mercy
defend us from all perils

58:24.770 --> 58:26.841
and dangers of this night,

58:26.876 --> 58:31.780
for the love of Thy only
son, our savior Jesus Christ.

58:33.049 --> 58:33.914
Amen.

58:44.628 --> 58:47.497
- My new conviction
in a higher being

58:47.532 --> 58:50.397
did not exactly make
me a paid-up member

58:50.433 --> 58:51.899
in the Church of England.

58:53.436 --> 58:56.371
But now that I believed in God,

58:56.406 --> 58:58.606
I wanted to know more of him,

58:58.641 --> 59:01.745
from any source, pagan
or Christian.

59:01.780 --> 59:05.009
The question was no longer
to find the one true religion

59:05.045 --> 59:09.279
among many, but where
had the thing grown up.

59:10.423 --> 59:13.619
Paganism was the childhood
of religion.

59:13.654 --> 59:15.890
Where had it reached maturity?

59:16.992 --> 59:21.224
As for the materialists,
their view was out of court.

59:21.260 --> 59:24.963
If reason is only the
accidental result of atoms

59:25.031 --> 59:28.931
colliding in skulls, I
could see no reason

59:28.966 --> 59:30.806
to believe that one accident

59:30.841 --> 59:34.007
should give the correct account
for all other accidents.

59:37.815 --> 59:40.175
My allegiance was now
with the mass of humanity

59:40.211 --> 59:44.182
who danced, sang and
prayed, worshiped.

59:46.590 --> 59:48.653
There isn't really an
infinite variety

59:48.688 --> 59:50.119
of religions you know.

59:50.188 --> 59:52.823
To me, the only ones
worth considering

59:52.858 --> 59:55.193
are Christianity and Hinduism.

59:55.228 --> 59:58.262
Islam is only the greatest
of the Christian heresies.

59:58.297 --> 1:00:01.636
Buddhism's only the greatest
of the Hindu heresies.

1:00:01.672 --> 1:00:04.108
All that is best in
Judaism and Plato

1:00:04.143 --> 1:00:06.003
survives in Christianity

1:00:06.072 --> 1:00:09.373
and Hinduism bears no
historical claim.

1:00:09.408 --> 1:00:12.242
That had been put into my head
by that hard-boiled atheist,

1:00:12.278 --> 1:00:16.651
who said, "All that
mythology about a dying God

1:00:16.686 --> 1:00:19.954
looks as if it really
happened once."

1:00:21.255 --> 1:00:26.295
One day Tolkien and I took
a stroll on Addison's walk.

1:00:26.330 --> 1:00:27.696
As we talked, I said.

1:00:27.765 --> 1:00:31.865
- Tollers, I have, with
considerable resistance,

1:00:31.901 --> 1:00:37.136
come to believe in God,
but not Christianity.

1:00:37.570 --> 1:00:38.873
- Oh Jack.

1:00:38.909 --> 1:00:40.973
- I cannot believe something
I do not understand.

1:00:41.008 --> 1:00:42.472
How can the life and
death of someone else,

1:00:42.507 --> 1:00:46.344
whoever he was, 2000 years ago,
help us in the here and now.

1:00:46.379 --> 1:00:49.720
- When you meet a
God sacrificing
himself in a pagan story

1:00:49.755 --> 1:00:53.285
like Dionysus, Balder, Osiris
or even in a fairy tale,

1:00:53.320 --> 1:00:56.892
you like it very much and
are mysteriously moved by it.

1:00:56.927 --> 1:00:59.892
Provided you meet it anywhere
except in the gospels.

1:00:59.927 --> 1:01:01.565
Well the story of
Christ is a myth,

1:01:01.633 --> 1:01:03.328
working on us in the
same way as other myths,

1:01:03.363 --> 1:01:06.770
with one tremendous difference
in that it really happened.

1:01:10.139 --> 1:01:15.142
- Suddenly a rush of wind
interrupted us, startling me.

1:01:15.177 --> 1:01:19.545
So many leaves fell to the
ground I thought it was raining.

1:01:19.580 --> 1:01:20.476
I held my breath.

1:01:21.479 --> 1:01:23.818
- Come on, Jack. You're
too slow to catch a cold.

1:01:23.853 --> 1:01:25.584
You know Dyson hates
sitting on those steps

1:01:25.653 --> 1:01:27.054
waiting to be let in.

1:01:34.360 --> 1:01:37.300
- I don't know if Tollers
remembered that moment.

1:01:37.336 --> 1:01:40.197
I did. His words hit home.

1:01:40.233 --> 1:01:43.873
No matter how unwilling,
I was beginning to move.

1:01:57.953 --> 1:02:00.923
Tollers and I talked
deep into the night.

1:02:01.722 --> 1:02:04.426
Hugo Dyson joined us.

1:02:04.461 --> 1:02:07.463
- Beef. Sensational pie.

1:02:07.498 --> 1:02:09.163
- You make a mess with that.

1:02:09.899 --> 1:02:12.330
Now this stuff will put
hairs on your chest.

1:02:13.403 --> 1:02:14.799
- Here she is.

1:02:14.834 --> 1:02:16.268
Make space would you.

1:02:17.340 --> 1:02:18.336
There we go.

1:02:20.140 --> 1:02:22.411
- Look, I may be prepared
to accept Jesus

1:02:22.447 --> 1:02:24.439
as a great moral teacher,

1:02:24.508 --> 1:02:26.645
but I simply cannot accept
his claim to be God.

1:02:26.681 --> 1:02:28.147
- Oh, come on Jack.

1:02:28.216 --> 1:02:30.818
How could a mere man be
called a great moral teacher

1:02:30.887 --> 1:02:32.715
and say the sort of
things Jesus said?

1:02:32.751 --> 1:02:34.357
- Such as?

1:02:34.426 --> 1:02:35.957
- That he always existed.

1:02:35.992 --> 1:02:37.727
- That he was coming
again to judge the world.

1:02:37.762 --> 1:02:40.930
- Such men are judged
frauds, lunatics.

1:02:42.500 --> 1:02:44.263
- In spite of my resistance,

1:02:44.298 --> 1:02:47.469
they convinced me that
nothing else in all literature

1:02:47.505 --> 1:02:49.336
is just like the gospels.

1:02:50.005 --> 1:02:52.237
Myths are like it in
one way with its stories

1:02:52.272 --> 1:02:54.941
of the miraculous,
histories like it in another

1:02:54.976 --> 1:02:57.777
with its attention
to minute details,

1:02:57.812 --> 1:03:01.080
but nothing is simply like it.

1:03:01.115 --> 1:03:05.218
And no person is like
the person depicted.

1:03:05.985 --> 1:03:07.018
- I'm sure there are many people

1:03:07.087 --> 1:03:08.953
who believe themselves
to be God.

1:03:08.988 --> 1:03:11.527
Our hospitals are full of them.

1:03:11.595 --> 1:03:13.796
- Oh, come on Jack be serious.

1:03:13.832 --> 1:03:15.861
No great moral teacher
has ever made that claim

1:03:15.929 --> 1:03:17.401
except Jesus, and you know it.

1:03:17.469 --> 1:03:19.995
- And he went on and on and on.

1:03:20.031 --> 1:03:21.201
- What do you mean?

1:03:22.474 --> 1:03:24.136
- Well, claiming to forgive sins

1:03:24.171 --> 1:03:25.837
and that he himself is
the injured party

1:03:25.872 --> 1:03:27.173
in every transgression.

1:03:27.209 --> 1:03:30.308
Look, in anyone else this
would be thought silly.

1:03:30.344 --> 1:03:32.647
- Suppose you told me that
two of your colleagues

1:03:32.682 --> 1:03:33.782
had lost you a top professorship

1:03:33.817 --> 1:03:36.313
by telling lies about
your character.

1:03:36.348 --> 1:03:41.152
And I replied "Freely
forgive them both."

1:03:41.188 --> 1:03:42.722
Would you not think
this sheer lunacy?

1:03:42.791 --> 1:03:43.891
- It would be sheer lunacy.

1:03:43.959 --> 1:03:46.128
- Yet, even those
who opposed Jesus

1:03:46.163 --> 1:03:49.895
admitted that he expressed
moral truth of depth and purity

1:03:49.963 --> 1:03:52.896
full of wisdom and shrewdness.

1:03:52.965 --> 1:03:55.299
- Wisdom and shrewdness.

1:03:55.334 --> 1:03:57.505
You make him sound like
Solomon the great.

1:03:57.540 --> 1:03:58.742
- On the contrary,

1:03:58.777 --> 1:04:00.174
history repeatedly calls
him humble and meek.

1:04:00.209 --> 1:04:02.705
- Not that you want to
notice that of course Jack.

1:04:02.741 --> 1:04:04.641
Humility and meekness are the
last things one would ascribe

1:04:04.676 --> 1:04:08.083
to someone who makes claims
worthy of being a megalomaniac.

1:04:12.188 --> 1:04:15.822
- The Great Knock taught
me to shame inconsistency.

1:04:15.857 --> 1:04:17.660
If Jesus' statements are false.

1:04:17.696 --> 1:04:19.696
Christianity is of
no importance.

1:04:19.732 --> 1:04:23.493
If true, it is of infinite
importance,

1:04:23.529 --> 1:04:27.971
but one thing it cannot be
is moderately important.

1:04:29.805 --> 1:04:32.308
- So what are you saying?

1:04:33.144 --> 1:04:38.177
- Simply that either this man
was, and is, the son of God

1:04:38.246 --> 1:04:41.985
or else he is a liar,
a lunatic or a fraud,

1:04:42.984 --> 1:04:44.281
but all this patronizing
nonsense

1:04:44.350 --> 1:04:46.187
about him being some
great moral teacher,

1:04:46.222 --> 1:04:50.092
it's not an option to us,
nor was it intended to be.

1:04:52.058 --> 1:04:53.929
- I felt a resistance to this

1:04:53.965 --> 1:04:57.593
almost as strong as my
resistance to theism.

1:04:57.628 --> 1:05:00.869
Every step from the
absolute to spirit to God

1:05:00.904 --> 1:05:03.974
was a step toward the
more concrete.

1:05:04.042 --> 1:05:08.570
And now to accept the
incarnation that God became man

1:05:08.605 --> 1:05:11.507
was a further step in
the same direction.

1:05:11.543 --> 1:05:14.985
Oh, this too was something
I had not wanted.

1:05:19.121 --> 1:05:21.986
I remember very well when,
but hardly how,

1:05:22.055 --> 1:05:24.588
the final step was taken.

1:05:24.623 --> 1:05:27.558
I was being driven by my
brother Warnie to Whipsnade Zoo

1:05:27.593 --> 1:05:30.632
in the sidecar of a
motorcycle one Sunday morning

1:05:30.667 --> 1:05:32.596
in the autumn of 1931.

1:05:33.431 --> 1:05:35.838
When we set out, I
did not believe

1:05:35.873 --> 1:05:38.839
that Jesus Christ is
the son of God.

1:05:38.874 --> 1:05:41.509
When we reached the zoo, I did,

1:05:42.345 --> 1:05:46.544
I had not spent the journey
in thought, or great emotion.

1:05:47.447 --> 1:05:50.180
It was more like a man
who, after a long sleep,

1:05:50.216 --> 1:05:55.454
has become aware
he is now awake.

1:06:01.693 --> 1:06:06.402
My conversion shed new
light on my search for joy.

1:06:07.205 --> 1:06:11.040
The overwhelming longings
that emerged from "Phantastes"

1:06:11.109 --> 1:06:15.105
and my brother's toy garden
were merely signposts

1:06:15.140 --> 1:06:17.339
to what I truly desired.

1:06:17.374 --> 1:06:19.982
They were not the thing itself.

1:06:20.018 --> 1:06:23.382
I concluded that if I
find in myself a desire

1:06:23.418 --> 1:06:27.454
that no experience in
this world could satisfy,

1:06:27.490 --> 1:06:32.557
the most probable explanation,
I was made for another world.

1:06:34.626 --> 1:06:37.661
At present we're on the
outside of that world,

1:06:38.901 --> 1:06:40.730
the wrong side of the door.

1:06:42.007 --> 1:06:45.440
We cannot mingle with
the splendors we see,

1:06:46.309 --> 1:06:49.539
but all the leaves of the
New Testament are rustling

1:06:49.575 --> 1:06:53.850
with the rumor that it
will not always be so.

1:06:53.885 --> 1:06:58.121
One day, God willing,
we shall get in.

1:07:02.125 --> 1:07:05.755
Meanwhile, the cross
comes before the crown

1:07:07.061 --> 1:07:09.693
and tomorrow is another morning.

1:07:11.269 --> 1:07:14.764
A cleft has opened in the
pitiless walls of this world,

1:07:15.966 --> 1:07:20.737
and we have been invited to
follow our great captain inside.

1:07:23.312 --> 1:07:28.151
Following him is of course
the essential point.

1:07:39.528 --> 1:07:44.300
- That Christmas, I took the
short walk to my parish church.

1:07:44.970 --> 1:07:48.435
That walk marked the
end of one journey

1:07:49.136 --> 1:07:51.405
and the beginning of another.

1:08:03.054 --> 1:08:05.922
- As I looked around,
I thought not only

1:08:05.957 --> 1:08:08.588
of my own potential
glory hereafter,

1:08:09.291 --> 1:08:12.360
but also that of my
neighbor's glory.

1:08:13.959 --> 1:08:17.759
It is a serious thing to live
in a society of possible gods

1:08:17.795 --> 1:08:20.301
and goddesses, to
remember that the dullest,

1:08:20.336 --> 1:08:24.270
most uninteresting person
you meet may one day

1:08:24.305 --> 1:08:26.902
be a creature that
if you saw it now,

1:08:26.937 --> 1:08:30.642
you would be strongly tempted
to fall down and worship

1:08:30.677 --> 1:08:35.114
or else a horror or a
corruption such as you now meet,

1:08:35.149 --> 1:08:38.386
if at all, only in a nightmare.

1:08:40.487 --> 1:08:42.718
All day long, we are
helping each other

1:08:42.754 --> 1:08:47.362
to one or the other of
these two destinations.

1:08:48.531 --> 1:08:51.364
It is in the light of these
overwhelming possibilities

1:08:51.399 --> 1:08:54.798
that I should now conduct
all my dealings.

1:08:58.568 --> 1:09:00.936
There are no ordinary people.

1:09:02.374 --> 1:09:04.807
I've never met a mere mortal.

1:09:04.843 --> 1:09:10.048
Nations, cultures,
civilizations, these are mortal.

1:09:10.550 --> 1:09:13.884
Their life is to ours
as that of a gnat.

1:09:14.654 --> 1:09:18.156
It is immortals whom we
joke with, work with,

1:09:18.191 --> 1:09:23.230
marry, snub, exploit.

1:09:23.332 --> 1:09:27.903
The weight or burden of
my neighbors glory

1:09:27.938 --> 1:09:30.506
should be laid daily on my back.

1:09:31.176 --> 1:09:36.411
A load so heavy, only
humility can carry it.

1:09:38.149 --> 1:09:41.845
And the backs of the proud
will be broken.

1:10:36.241 --> 1:10:39.909
- Christ our Passover
is sacrificed for us.

1:10:39.944 --> 1:10:42.741
Therefore let us keep the feast.

1:10:57.128 --> 1:10:59.989
The body of our Lord
Jesus Christ.

1:11:02.564 --> 1:11:05.929
- Unlike my first
communion, 17 years earlier.

1:11:07.101 --> 1:11:08.635
I now believed.

1:11:24.318 --> 1:11:26.087
- Okay. Thanks very much.

1:11:26.122 --> 1:11:27.888
That's a cut there. Thank you.

1:11:27.957 --> 1:11:29.185
Thank you Max.

1:11:29.254 --> 1:11:30.419
- Thank you.
