00:01.566 --> 00:03.003
<i>Previously on "Reginald the Vampire"...</i>

00:03.090 --> 00:04.091
<i>She gives me blood.</i>

00:04.178 --> 00:05.570
<i>She gives me kisses.</i>

00:05.657 --> 00:08.008
Put them together,
the perfect woman.

00:08.095 --> 00:10.053
Abraham was
a vampire of legend.

00:10.140 --> 00:12.534
He could turn a vampire
back to human.

00:12.621 --> 00:15.319
<i>We found Abraham
in Spokane, Washington.</i>

00:15.406 --> 00:17.060
It's not
what it looks like!

00:17.147 --> 00:18.409
I can explain!

00:18.496 --> 00:19.410
<i>You know what you are?</i>

00:19.497 --> 00:20.411
You're a disease.

00:20.498 --> 00:22.370
<i>I killed Todd.</i>

00:22.457 --> 00:25.895
<i>I'm a liar, an asshole,
and a murderer.</i>

00:27.897 --> 00:31.466
<i>♪ Sail on, brother ♪</i>

00:31.553 --> 00:35.035
<i>♪ Don't let go ♪</i>

00:35.122 --> 00:36.993
Hey, friend.

00:37.080 --> 00:40.649
Buy a fellow traveler a drink?

00:40.736 --> 00:43.782
How do you know
I'm not from around here?

00:43.869 --> 00:47.134
You got the look of a man
who left home in the rearview.

00:47.221 --> 00:50.311
Billy.

00:50.398 --> 00:52.878
Reginald.

00:52.965 --> 00:54.532
That drink?

00:56.534 --> 01:00.016
<i>♪ Hang on, brother ♪</i>

01:00.103 --> 01:01.757
<i>♪ Don't lose your way ♪</i>

01:01.844 --> 01:04.499
I'm about two weeks left
from broke.

01:04.586 --> 01:08.242
Ah, plenty there
to wet our whistles.

01:08.329 --> 01:12.420
Two pints of your finest
bottom-shelf brew.

01:12.507 --> 01:15.466
So...

01:15.553 --> 01:19.209
What's your story, Reginald?

01:19.296 --> 01:20.950
I don't really know anymore.

01:24.997 --> 01:28.305
Well,
cheers to not knowing.

01:33.528 --> 01:36.792
In fact,
every man's life comes down

01:36.879 --> 01:39.621
to that one pivotal moment,
like that crossroads

01:39.708 --> 01:41.579
with your name on it.

01:41.666 --> 01:44.974
Well...

01:45.061 --> 01:47.455
I think this is one
of those crossroad moments.

01:47.542 --> 01:48.804
Do you?

01:48.891 --> 01:50.240
I'm offering you
the opportunity

01:50.327 --> 01:52.242
to change the trajectory
of your life.

01:52.329 --> 01:54.418
How's that?

01:59.206 --> 02:00.642
You play poker?

02:06.561 --> 02:09.477
Go on, then.

02:09.564 --> 02:11.348
I'm easy.

02:11.435 --> 02:12.654
Raise another 20.

02:15.613 --> 02:17.006
Call.

02:24.709 --> 02:27.147
Full------- house.

02:27.234 --> 02:30.106
Good hand.

02:30.193 --> 02:31.716
Not good enough.

02:31.803 --> 02:33.370
Straight flush.

02:33.457 --> 02:35.111
Hell no!

02:35.198 --> 02:37.331
That ain't right!
- The river don't lie.

02:37.418 --> 02:38.941
Yeah, you're just
some kind of card shark.

02:39.028 --> 02:41.465
Been playing me from the jump.

02:41.552 --> 02:42.640
The hell you think
you're going?

02:44.860 --> 02:46.775
I'm just a little farther
from broke than I was before.

02:46.862 --> 02:49.256
And I got enough money
to buy everybody a beer.

02:49.343 --> 02:51.910
- Okay.
- All right.

02:51.997 --> 02:54.870
Y'all just gonna let him
walk away, this clown?

02:54.957 --> 02:57.525
After he cheated us
out of our money?

02:57.612 --> 02:59.962
Billy,

03:00.049 --> 03:02.399
I don't like
being called a cheater.

03:02.486 --> 03:03.835
I don't like
being called a clown.

03:03.922 --> 03:05.315
Give me back my money.

03:05.402 --> 03:06.751
Crossroads.

03:06.838 --> 03:08.057
That's what you said.

03:08.144 --> 03:09.711
You took a look into my wallet,

03:09.798 --> 03:11.539
you saw an opportunity,

03:11.626 --> 03:13.802
but it didn't turn out
the way you planned because--

03:13.889 --> 03:16.544
and this is really funny
when you think about it--

03:16.631 --> 03:18.850
the crossroads weren't for me.

03:18.937 --> 03:20.287
They were for you.

03:20.374 --> 03:22.550
Give me back
my goddamn money,

03:22.637 --> 03:24.204
or you'll pay me another way.

03:24.291 --> 03:26.075
Ah, I can't do that.

03:26.162 --> 03:27.468
I finally have enough cash

03:27.555 --> 03:28.860
to keep myself going
a little longer.

03:28.947 --> 03:30.079
The only thing
you're gonna do

03:30.166 --> 03:31.515
is die where you're standing.

03:34.562 --> 03:37.129
The thing is, I can't die.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.174
It's impossible.

03:38.261 --> 03:39.654
You wanna bet?

03:39.741 --> 03:41.221
I think we've established

03:41.308 --> 03:43.614
that gambling is not
your strongest suit.

03:43.701 --> 03:45.834
Get it? Suit, like--

03:45.921 --> 03:46.922
I get what you're saying.

03:47.009 --> 03:48.445
No, you don't.

03:48.532 --> 03:50.839
When I tell you can't die,

03:50.926 --> 03:53.842
I'm not speaking a metaphor.

03:53.929 --> 03:58.150
I'm genuinely trying to share
an important fact with you.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.717
What the hell would that be?

03:59.804 --> 04:02.242
I'm a mother------- vampire.

04:04.069 --> 04:05.070
Oh, shit!

04:05.157 --> 04:06.724
Go, go, go!

04:13.992 --> 04:17.257
I'll take that beer, vampire,

04:17.344 --> 04:21.609
and a couple of minutes
of your time.

04:21.696 --> 04:23.263
Why?

04:23.350 --> 04:25.221
You're just the man
I've been looking for.

04:27.528 --> 04:28.877
I think you have me mistaken
for somebody else.

04:28.964 --> 04:31.662
I'm no one.

04:31.749 --> 04:33.621
I've been watching you.

04:33.708 --> 04:36.145
It seems to me
you're here for some reason.

04:38.147 --> 04:39.453
What do you want from me?

04:39.540 --> 04:41.759
You're looking for something.

04:41.846 --> 04:43.805
I think I can help you
find it--

04:43.892 --> 04:47.374
uh, find him.

04:47.461 --> 04:50.551
A friend of mine told me
about a very legendary vampire,

04:50.638 --> 04:53.467
whose powers--
well, let's just say

04:53.554 --> 04:56.078
he can do things
other vampires can't.

04:56.165 --> 04:58.559
And I've been
searching for him.

04:58.646 --> 05:00.125
His name is Abraham.

05:00.212 --> 05:03.390
And what do you want
from this Abraham?

05:03.477 --> 05:05.087
I want to ask him
an improbable question.

05:05.174 --> 05:06.306
Improbable?

05:06.393 --> 05:07.350
Hmm.

05:07.437 --> 05:09.874
I'm intrigued.

05:09.961 --> 05:12.181
Ah, it's personal.

05:12.268 --> 05:14.226
Say no more.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.794
I've been looking for clues,
including any other vampires

05:16.881 --> 05:17.926
who could help me.

05:18.013 --> 05:20.320
But you're not a vampire.

05:20.407 --> 05:23.627
I'm just Jenkins.

05:23.714 --> 05:26.935
But I know
the vampire that you seek.

05:27.022 --> 05:29.067
I've been seeking him too.

05:29.154 --> 05:30.591
Really?

05:30.678 --> 05:31.983
For what?

05:34.246 --> 05:35.160
It's personal.

05:35.247 --> 05:37.511
Say no more.

05:39.295 --> 05:41.819
Maybe between the two of us,
we could find him.

05:41.906 --> 05:44.822
Oh, I already know
where Abraham is.

05:44.909 --> 05:46.215
You just said
you were seeking him.

05:46.302 --> 05:47.738
I'm pretty sure
you said "seeking."

05:47.825 --> 05:51.351
I know where he resides.

05:51.438 --> 05:54.441
The fact is,
I can't go in there alone.

05:54.528 --> 05:57.487
I'm not strong enough.

05:57.574 --> 06:00.882
Everyone who has gone
into that place

06:00.969 --> 06:02.710
has never come out.

06:02.797 --> 06:04.320
I get it.

06:04.407 --> 06:06.191
Only a vampire can get
to another vampire.

06:06.278 --> 06:09.760
You wouldn't be the first.

06:09.847 --> 06:13.285
Many vampires have
sought him out,

06:13.373 --> 06:16.158
and every one has failed.

06:16.245 --> 06:18.116
Then why me?

06:18.203 --> 06:20.292
I need a hero.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.426
Okay, I'm no hero.

06:23.513 --> 06:25.559
Oh, yes, you are.
I'm sure of it.

06:25.646 --> 06:30.259
Look, "just Jenkins,"
I let down,

06:30.346 --> 06:34.002
disappointed, betrayed,
deceived, and hurt

06:34.089 --> 06:36.570
anyone who's ever meant
anything to me.

06:36.657 --> 06:38.746
And as soon as I was finished
laying ruin to my life,

06:38.833 --> 06:40.400
I ran away.

06:40.487 --> 06:43.577
So trust me when I say this--

06:43.664 --> 06:46.580
I'm no hero.

06:46.667 --> 06:48.059
Let's go, Reginald.

06:48.146 --> 06:49.757
Time's a'wasting.

06:49.844 --> 06:53.630
Did you not hear
a single word I just said?

06:53.717 --> 06:55.458
Come with me,

06:55.545 --> 06:58.548
and I will help you get
what you want.

07:08.732 --> 07:11.518
If I were
a vampire of legend,

07:11.605 --> 07:16.000
this is exactly the not place
I would not live.

07:16.087 --> 07:18.916
Tell me, what is it
you're looking for, Reginald?

07:19.003 --> 07:22.093
What is
the improbable question?

07:22.180 --> 07:23.094
Salvation.

07:23.181 --> 07:26.315
Oh, big ask.

07:26.402 --> 07:28.056
It feels like
it's my only chance.

07:28.143 --> 07:30.188
It's my only chance too.

07:30.275 --> 07:31.581
For what?

07:31.668 --> 07:34.062
A new heart.

07:34.149 --> 07:37.457
My current ticker
has a shelf life.

07:37.544 --> 07:40.503
Big ask.

07:40.590 --> 07:44.115
All right, Tin Woodsman,
let's do this thing.

07:48.946 --> 07:50.861
Whoa. What the--

08:01.045 --> 08:02.264
Are you seeing
what I'm seeing?

08:02.351 --> 08:03.961
Yes,

08:04.048 --> 08:07.617
assuming seeing is believing.

08:07.704 --> 08:09.053
This is it.

08:09.140 --> 08:10.751
This is the place.
It has to be.

08:10.838 --> 08:12.404
Agreed.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.884
Although I do think

08:13.971 --> 08:17.366
that you are
a tad underdressed.

08:24.460 --> 08:26.680
There's no doors.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.986
No elevator.

08:29.073 --> 08:31.206
No stairs.

08:31.293 --> 08:35.297
No way out,
except the way we came in.

08:35.384 --> 08:37.125
I'm not leaving
until we find Abraham.

08:37.212 --> 08:40.389
Of course,
the improbable question.

08:41.869 --> 08:44.045
Hello.

08:44.132 --> 08:45.699
Welcome to the party.

08:45.786 --> 08:46.830
Who are you?

08:46.917 --> 08:48.832
I'm Reginald.

08:48.919 --> 08:52.401
Tell me, what is
this question of yours?

08:55.273 --> 08:57.754
My life is not the life
I'm supposed to be living.

08:59.582 --> 09:00.627
I need to go back.

09:00.714 --> 09:03.543
Back to where?

09:03.630 --> 09:05.370
According to legend,

09:05.457 --> 09:07.416
there's something
only Abraham can do.

09:07.503 --> 09:10.506
Oh? What's that?

09:10.593 --> 09:11.855
He can make me human again.

09:14.989 --> 09:17.948
That's a very big ask.

09:18.035 --> 09:19.515
You want a heart.

09:19.602 --> 09:21.909
Yes, one organ.

09:21.996 --> 09:23.475
Well, I have to try.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.217
What's so great
about being human?

09:26.304 --> 09:28.176
First, you're born.

09:28.263 --> 09:31.092
And then begins
the march towards death.

09:31.179 --> 09:32.484
I should know.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.704
But is that so bad, though?

09:34.791 --> 09:37.185
To have a finite amount of time
to live your best life?

09:37.272 --> 09:38.665
I was better
being human anyway.

09:38.752 --> 09:40.884
Are you sure about that?

09:40.971 --> 09:42.973
I don't know.

09:43.060 --> 09:45.193
At least I had practice.

09:45.280 --> 09:48.413
But with practice,

09:48.500 --> 09:51.678
won't you become
a better vampire?

09:51.765 --> 09:54.898
With everything I've done,
I'm thinking not.

10:11.523 --> 10:13.613
We didn't order these.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.223
First drinks are always
on the house, gentlemen.

10:15.310 --> 10:18.400
Well, isn't that cordial?

10:18.487 --> 10:19.706
What can I do you for?

10:19.793 --> 10:21.055
We're looking for someone.

10:21.142 --> 10:22.317
Perhaps in this crowd?

10:22.404 --> 10:23.492
Someone else.

10:23.579 --> 10:24.798
He goes by the name of Abraham.

10:24.885 --> 10:28.410
Of course, our famous tenant.

10:28.497 --> 10:30.542
He's--he's here?

10:30.630 --> 10:32.632
Abraham once lived
in the penthouse.

10:32.719 --> 10:35.199
Lived, or lives?

10:35.286 --> 10:37.027
He inspired many a legend.

10:37.114 --> 10:39.987
Really? Enlighten us.

10:40.074 --> 10:42.816
Oh, there are
so many to choose from.

10:42.903 --> 10:45.993
But I think it best
I stick with a classic.

10:46.080 --> 10:49.605
Once upon a time,
a powerful creature ruled

10:49.692 --> 10:51.955
over the kingdom of his kind.

10:52.042 --> 10:54.305
He was a fair
and gracious leader,

10:54.392 --> 10:56.568
loved by all.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.876
But there were some
who wanted to take his power

10:59.963 --> 11:03.488
and use it to satisfy
their own desires.

11:03.575 --> 11:05.142
There was a man--

11:05.229 --> 11:06.970
no longer a man--

11:07.057 --> 11:09.407
who challenged him.

11:09.494 --> 11:10.582
I know this part.

11:10.670 --> 11:11.975
Logan the Putrescent,

11:12.062 --> 11:14.151
the head
of the Vampire Council.

11:14.238 --> 11:17.154
He hired assassins
to murder Abraham.

11:17.241 --> 11:19.766
Killer after killer
came through these doors.

11:19.853 --> 11:23.030
The attacks on Abraham
were relentless.

11:23.117 --> 11:25.859
The best assassins
that money could buy.

11:25.946 --> 11:27.295
Nikki.

11:27.382 --> 11:29.384
Nikki was impressive.

11:29.471 --> 11:31.386
She never made it upstairs.

11:31.473 --> 11:33.823
I quite liked her. Pity.

11:33.910 --> 11:36.652
Nobody got out alive,
except Nikki.

11:36.739 --> 11:38.480
She had a partner,
didn't she?

11:38.567 --> 11:40.047
Hard to keep track.

11:40.134 --> 11:42.789
He had a patch of white hair.

11:42.876 --> 11:44.660
Now that you mention it,
that does ring a bell.

11:44.747 --> 11:46.053
So what about
the rest of the story?

11:46.140 --> 11:47.489
What about Abraham?
Is he alive?

11:47.576 --> 11:49.143
Perhaps.

11:49.230 --> 11:51.101
Not quite.

11:51.188 --> 11:52.407
Maybe.

11:52.494 --> 11:55.410
Quite possibly.

11:55.497 --> 11:58.326
I hope so.

11:58.413 --> 12:00.545
Well, now I'm
completely confused.

12:05.072 --> 12:06.682
It's you!

12:06.769 --> 12:08.902
It's him.

12:08.989 --> 12:10.120
You're Stanley.

12:10.207 --> 12:11.382
Who's Stanley?

12:11.469 --> 12:14.559
Nikki's partner.

12:14.646 --> 12:15.778
Man.

12:18.476 --> 12:20.522
Hey, dude.

12:23.003 --> 12:24.439
Was that elevator always there?

12:24.526 --> 12:26.093
Maybe it's magic.

12:26.180 --> 12:27.703
A magical conveyance?

12:27.790 --> 12:30.271
Ha!

12:30.358 --> 12:32.229
Did you see that?

12:32.316 --> 12:36.538
I may be wrong
about its supernatural aspects.

12:41.325 --> 12:44.764
We need to get
into that elevator.

12:44.851 --> 12:46.504
Hurry, Jenkins.

12:46.591 --> 12:47.897
That elevator's the only way
to get to the penthouse.

12:47.984 --> 12:49.551
Yeah, we'll get there,
all right.

12:49.638 --> 12:50.639
Okay, but if it can
appear out of nowhere,

12:50.726 --> 12:51.683
it can disappear just as quick.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.076
Let's go.

12:53.163 --> 12:54.774
It's this damn
weak ticker of mine.

12:54.861 --> 12:57.733
Okay, let me help you.

12:57.820 --> 12:59.561
Sorry?
- See you next time.

12:59.648 --> 13:00.649
Sure, I guess.

13:00.736 --> 13:02.390
Come again soon.

13:02.477 --> 13:04.174
Did you hear that?
Is that weird?

13:04.261 --> 13:05.741
I think this party has
taken a turn.

13:05.828 --> 13:07.482
Time for you to go.

13:07.569 --> 13:09.789
Okay, seriously can't get
out of here fast enough.

13:11.181 --> 13:12.443
No buttons?

13:12.530 --> 13:14.881
How inconvenient.

13:14.968 --> 13:16.970
- But there has to be a button!
- Nothing.

13:17.057 --> 13:18.667
Wait.

13:18.754 --> 13:20.147
I got this.

13:27.023 --> 13:28.068
Maybe not.

13:28.155 --> 13:29.809
In my experience,

13:29.896 --> 13:33.073
doors are best walked through
when open.

13:33.160 --> 13:34.770
It's a magic elevator.

13:34.857 --> 13:36.554
The usual law of physics
don't usually apply here.

13:38.992 --> 13:40.558
Hold on.

13:40.645 --> 13:42.473
What is it?

13:42.560 --> 13:44.171
The music.

13:44.258 --> 13:45.476
It's different.

13:48.653 --> 13:50.003
Uh, I think we made them angry.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.613
How so?

13:51.700 --> 13:54.268
No idea, but it looks
like the party's over.

13:54.355 --> 13:57.227
Thoughts? Plots? Plans?

13:57.314 --> 13:59.229
I'm open to suggestion.

13:59.316 --> 14:01.275
Unbelievable.
I get it now.

14:01.362 --> 14:03.625
This is--this actually makes
a lot of sense.

14:03.712 --> 14:05.627
- It does? How?
- Basic cytology.

14:05.714 --> 14:07.368
Come again?

14:07.455 --> 14:09.718
It's the analysis
of single cells in the body.

14:09.805 --> 14:11.894
Ever since we walked in here,
all these people,

14:11.981 --> 14:15.245
or whatever they are, have been
making comments about us.

14:15.332 --> 14:17.508
Who are we? What do we want?

14:17.595 --> 14:19.032
And now they want us out.

14:19.119 --> 14:20.990
Yeah, well,
that much is clear.

14:21.077 --> 14:22.470
They're like
white blood cells,

14:22.557 --> 14:23.993
and white blood cells
kill viruses.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.386
Well,
that's a good thing, huh?

14:25.473 --> 14:27.170
- Not exactly.
- Because?

14:27.257 --> 14:29.564
We're the virus.

14:29.651 --> 14:32.480
Leave this to me.

14:32.567 --> 14:34.786
This is supposed to be a party.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.963
Let's dance.

14:37.050 --> 14:39.574
Uh, maybe I could
tell you a joke.

14:39.661 --> 14:41.402
I have millions of them.

14:41.489 --> 14:44.100
I--tough crowd.

14:44.187 --> 14:46.102
How are you doing?
- Not good!

14:46.189 --> 14:47.625
Keep trying to distract them.

14:47.712 --> 14:49.801
Try to get them out of sync!
- Will do.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.629
Look, I must apologize
for this.

14:51.716 --> 14:55.198
I abhor violence of any kind.

14:55.285 --> 14:56.547
But--

14:56.634 --> 14:58.636
ah! No!

14:58.723 --> 15:00.029
Jenkins!

15:00.116 --> 15:01.813
I'm afraid
I can't break free.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.425
I say! No!

15:04.512 --> 15:06.949
Save yourself, Reginald.
I'm not worth it.

15:07.036 --> 15:09.169
You must go on without me.

15:09.256 --> 15:12.520
No! No! I won't. I can't!

15:12.607 --> 15:13.738
Listen to me!

15:13.825 --> 15:15.436
You have the wrong guy!

15:15.523 --> 15:16.567
I'm the virus!

15:16.654 --> 15:18.787
I am the disease!

15:18.874 --> 15:20.876
I don't deserve to ask
a legendary vampire

15:20.963 --> 15:22.312
for some favor.

15:22.399 --> 15:24.532
Let Jenkins go
and find his heart.

15:24.619 --> 15:25.925
Take me instead!

15:26.012 --> 15:28.275
Please, take me!

15:32.192 --> 15:33.933
Somebody say something!

15:34.020 --> 15:35.717
I'm kind of at the end
of my rope here.

15:39.764 --> 15:40.896
Whoa.
- Whoo-hoo!

15:40.983 --> 15:42.854
What? Wait, what?

15:47.163 --> 15:50.601
I knew it!

15:50.688 --> 15:54.910
Reginald, you have no idea
how long I have waited

15:54.997 --> 15:57.565
for a heart as pure as yours.

15:57.652 --> 16:00.960
No, I told you,
you got the wrong guy.

16:01.047 --> 16:02.352
I'm just some jerk-off

16:02.439 --> 16:03.919
who's afraid
of his own failures

16:04.006 --> 16:05.355
and blames everything
on everyone else.

16:05.442 --> 16:07.314
Time to go, Reginald.

16:07.401 --> 16:09.794
Your journey is just beginning.

16:09.881 --> 16:12.449
Find me. Save me.

16:12.536 --> 16:15.191
Be my hero.

16:35.907 --> 16:37.300
Oh, hey!

16:37.387 --> 16:39.781
You're still here.

16:39.868 --> 16:44.003
Not that I know
how "here" works.

16:45.917 --> 16:49.878
I'm friends with--
or was friends

16:49.965 --> 16:51.575
with your partner--Nikki?

16:54.491 --> 16:55.536
I'm Reginald.

17:09.724 --> 17:12.379
Okay!

17:12.466 --> 17:15.556
So you're a ghost--

17:15.643 --> 17:17.993
or premonition?

17:18.080 --> 17:19.516
Yeah.

17:19.603 --> 17:21.866
I used to be human,

17:21.953 --> 17:24.086
and I'm hoping
to become human again.

17:26.349 --> 17:30.658
So, Stanley,
about your mission,

17:30.745 --> 17:33.139
I think...

17:33.226 --> 17:35.837
it would be worth reconsidering.

17:35.924 --> 17:37.143
And yes, if you're wondering,

17:37.230 --> 17:38.361
I do have
a personal interest in--

17:44.802 --> 17:46.021
Hang tight.

17:46.108 --> 17:47.675
This is my floor.

18:03.604 --> 18:06.172
Welcome to Slushy Shack.
How may I help you?

18:09.349 --> 18:10.872
You're alive!

18:10.959 --> 18:12.265
Am I?

18:12.352 --> 18:13.570
Well, that's good.

18:13.657 --> 18:14.963
It's Frazzleberry Friday.

18:15.050 --> 18:18.532
Todd, it's me, Reginald.

18:18.619 --> 18:21.012
You know, I mop and I mop,

18:21.100 --> 18:23.885
but this puddle,
it just won't go away.

18:23.972 --> 18:26.235
I did that.

18:26.322 --> 18:27.584
Why?

18:27.671 --> 18:29.586
I was upset.

18:29.673 --> 18:31.545
And you were hungry.

18:31.632 --> 18:32.850
You took me for granted.

18:32.937 --> 18:34.504
I'm sorry.

18:34.591 --> 18:35.810
I was your friend.

18:35.897 --> 18:37.551
Team Reggie.

18:37.638 --> 18:39.030
And you made me your meal plan.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.597
We can start over.

18:40.684 --> 18:42.077
Can we?

18:42.164 --> 18:44.384
Regi-round?

18:45.863 --> 18:47.909
We weren't really friends,
were we?

18:47.996 --> 18:49.998
Not really, anyway.

18:50.085 --> 18:52.479
I glamoured you to like me.

18:52.566 --> 18:53.915
That makes this okay?

18:54.002 --> 18:56.787
No. No.

18:56.874 --> 18:59.921
You've always been
a hungry boy, haven't you?

19:00.008 --> 19:02.489
Good time for a fat joke.

19:02.576 --> 19:04.491
Let's get real.

19:04.578 --> 19:07.581
Yes, you're a glutton.

19:07.668 --> 19:10.584
You're a glutton
for punishment.

19:10.671 --> 19:12.847
You make a huge mess,
and then you wallow in it,

19:12.934 --> 19:15.632
begging for forgiveness,
because, "Oh, deep down,

19:15.719 --> 19:17.112
I really am a nice guy."

19:17.199 --> 19:19.462
Oh, boo------- hoo!

19:19.549 --> 19:22.987
I almost forgot
what a jerk you could be.

19:23.074 --> 19:24.946
How you made me feel
about myself.

19:25.033 --> 19:26.861
Well, at least I own it.

19:26.948 --> 19:28.863
I don't mope around pretending
to be one of the good guys.

19:28.950 --> 19:29.907
You're a bully!

19:29.994 --> 19:31.170
You're a murderer.

19:33.563 --> 19:36.262
You win.

19:36.349 --> 19:38.307
Fine!

19:38.394 --> 19:39.482
You're right.

19:39.569 --> 19:41.919
Is that what you want to hear?

19:42.006 --> 19:46.054
I thought I was one
of the good guys, but I'm not.

19:46.141 --> 19:48.012
I lose control and I---- up

19:48.099 --> 19:51.755
and I hate myself for it.

19:51.842 --> 19:53.627
So you're right.

19:53.714 --> 19:58.109
I, Reginald Andres,
am a bad guy.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.372
Bingo.

20:07.728 --> 20:09.425
Weirder and weirder.

20:09.512 --> 20:11.035
<i>"What's the Story,
Morning Glory?"</i>

20:11.122 --> 20:12.907
<i>"Bored in the USA."</i>

20:12.994 --> 20:15.518
<i>Ooh, "Bad Together."</i>

20:15.605 --> 20:17.346
<i>I gotta find out
what happened to me.</i>

20:22.221 --> 20:24.353
Sarah?

20:26.050 --> 20:28.052
Sarah?

20:28.139 --> 20:30.490
Is it okay if I sit down?

20:30.577 --> 20:33.188
Okay, I guess
I'll just sit then.

20:36.496 --> 20:37.758
You lied to me.

20:37.845 --> 20:39.586
I--I didn't.

20:39.673 --> 20:40.978
You said, "Listen to me."

20:41.065 --> 20:42.763
Okay, I might have said that.

20:42.850 --> 20:46.636
You told me to forget
what I saw, to forget Nikki,

20:46.723 --> 20:48.856
to forget everything
up until the next time we met,

20:48.943 --> 20:50.640
and then it would all be fine.

20:50.727 --> 20:51.902
I had to.

20:51.989 --> 20:53.252
You didn't.

20:53.339 --> 20:57.386
You were so angry, so hurt.

20:57.473 --> 20:59.997
I couldn't stand it.
I had no choice!

21:00.084 --> 21:02.217
You could have told me
the truth.

21:02.304 --> 21:04.219
You could have explained.

21:04.306 --> 21:08.310
You could have been brave
and accepted what you've done.

21:08.397 --> 21:11.661
Instead, you chose deception--

21:11.748 --> 21:14.838
the weakest choice of all.

21:14.925 --> 21:17.928
It was to protect you.

21:18.015 --> 21:20.757
You tried to rip the thoughts
out of my head.

21:20.844 --> 21:24.544
You tried to steal them
and keep them for yourself.

21:24.631 --> 21:28.765
And now you sit here
in this place, in our place,

21:28.852 --> 21:31.246
and you tell me
that you did it for me?

21:31.333 --> 21:33.466
Do you know what you are?

21:33.553 --> 21:36.947
You're a spider
spinning a sticky web of lies

21:37.034 --> 21:40.168
to protect yourself
from your own mistakes.

21:42.213 --> 21:45.347
I couldn't stand the thought
of hurting you like that.

21:45.434 --> 21:48.002
You think a kept secret
isn't going to cause pain?

21:48.089 --> 21:50.309
I see that now.

21:50.396 --> 21:52.441
If I could go back,
I would change everything.

21:52.528 --> 21:54.138
But you can't.

21:54.225 --> 21:56.619
Just admit it!

21:56.706 --> 21:57.968
You lied.

21:58.055 --> 21:59.796
It was all a lie.

21:59.883 --> 22:02.059
Yes! I lied.

22:02.146 --> 22:03.104
Okay?

22:03.191 --> 22:06.629
I'm so sorry.

22:06.716 --> 22:08.327
I will do anything
to make it up to you.

22:08.414 --> 22:10.154
Please, Sarah.

22:10.241 --> 22:11.982
Forgive me.

22:15.290 --> 22:17.553
I think I can do that.

22:17.640 --> 22:20.600
Really?

22:20.687 --> 22:23.603
You can?

22:23.690 --> 22:26.997
Yes, Reginald.

22:27.084 --> 22:28.825
I forgive you.

22:34.004 --> 22:37.051
See?

22:37.138 --> 22:39.532
I can lie too.

22:39.619 --> 22:41.621
What? What do you mean?

22:41.708 --> 22:43.405
Sarah!

23:12.913 --> 23:14.523
I remember this night.

23:14.610 --> 23:16.830
It's the night you prayed
for a better life.

23:18.701 --> 23:20.355
It's the night
I became a monster.

23:20.442 --> 23:23.271
Becoming a vampire didn't
rob you of your humanity

23:23.358 --> 23:26.143
as much as your own willingness
to betray it did.

23:26.230 --> 23:29.059
My whole life was in front
of me, and it got taken away!

23:29.146 --> 23:30.800
Okay.

23:30.887 --> 23:32.367
What were you gonna do
with your life anyway?

23:32.454 --> 23:34.587
Hey!
That's us you're talking about.

23:34.674 --> 23:36.719
You don't think I know that?

23:36.806 --> 23:39.026
Every time you ruin something
for yourself,

23:39.113 --> 23:40.157
you've ruined it for me too.

23:40.244 --> 23:42.725
I didn't mean to!

23:42.812 --> 23:45.598
It's just when the family left,
I stayed

23:45.685 --> 23:47.730
because I wanted to be
someone else.

23:47.817 --> 23:49.993
Yeah, the cool, slick,

23:50.080 --> 23:52.561
swashbuckling hero
of his own story.

23:52.648 --> 23:54.955
No, only Keanu Reeves
can do that.

23:55.042 --> 23:56.435
He's amazing.

23:56.522 --> 23:58.698
He's so cool.

23:58.785 --> 24:01.875
Ugh, why--
why do I feel guilty,

24:01.962 --> 24:05.226
knowing that I ruined your life
when your life is my life?

24:05.313 --> 24:06.401
I don't make the rules.

24:06.488 --> 24:08.751
Truth?

24:08.838 --> 24:11.014
You weren't ever gonna change
on your own.

24:11.101 --> 24:12.712
You were given a gift.

24:12.799 --> 24:14.714
But you were too weak
to honor it,

24:14.801 --> 24:16.498
too cowardly to own it,

24:16.585 --> 24:18.500
and too proud to learn from it.

24:18.587 --> 24:20.937
You could have explored
how being a vampire

24:21.024 --> 24:23.374
made you a better person.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.726
But instead,
you used it to lie,

24:26.813 --> 24:31.252
to murder, to feed
your own ego and addiction.

24:31.339 --> 24:33.341
You try being a vampire
and see how that goes!

24:33.428 --> 24:36.736
You didn't do that
because you were a vampire.

24:36.823 --> 24:39.129
You did those things
because you're an asshole.

24:42.959 --> 24:46.180
I heard that.

24:46.267 --> 24:49.096
So what do I do now?

24:49.183 --> 24:53.187
That first night,
you prayed for a refund,

24:53.274 --> 24:55.494
a lucky break.

24:55.581 --> 24:59.280
And believe it or not,
you got one.

24:59.367 --> 25:01.282
I'm gonna have to pray again?

25:01.369 --> 25:04.590
It can't hurt.

25:04.677 --> 25:06.200
Ugh.

25:08.985 --> 25:10.944
Dear God

25:11.031 --> 25:14.121
and/or grown-up baby Jesus,

25:14.208 --> 25:17.080
I have to go back
to the beginning.

25:17.167 --> 25:20.736
Please, God,
or grown-up baby Jesus...

25:22.738 --> 25:25.567
Let me be human again.

25:25.654 --> 25:29.310
I don't want to be
a monster anymore.

25:29.397 --> 25:31.921
Let me be the man
I was meant to be.

25:32.008 --> 25:36.143
Let me be the man
that Sarah deserves.

25:36.230 --> 25:37.579
Amen.

25:46.370 --> 25:48.329
Oh.

25:48.416 --> 25:50.636
I was hoping we'd run
into each other again.

25:50.723 --> 25:52.376
Trail of bread crumbs,
am I right?

25:52.463 --> 25:55.075
Look, you're gonna lead me to--
whoa, okay, okay.

25:55.162 --> 25:56.990
Look, I know you can't
hear me or whatever,

25:57.077 --> 25:59.427
but what you're about to do,
I beg you,

25:59.514 --> 26:01.908
please, don't do it.

26:01.995 --> 26:03.213
Leave Abraham alone.

26:06.739 --> 26:09.219
I am never gonna
get used to that.

26:13.963 --> 26:15.312
Maurice?

26:22.929 --> 26:24.583
Reggie.

26:24.670 --> 26:26.585
Reggie.
Reggie, where are you going?

26:26.672 --> 26:27.803
To stop Stanley from killing

26:27.890 --> 26:29.283
the only person
who can help me.

26:29.370 --> 26:30.676
No, no, no,
we need to talk, man.

26:30.763 --> 26:32.068
You missed the assessment, okay?

26:32.155 --> 26:33.679
No one misses
the damn assessment.

26:33.766 --> 26:35.506
Everyone you know had
a target on their back.

26:35.594 --> 26:38.335
Logan the Defecator
canceled his travel plans!

26:38.422 --> 26:39.902
You have any idea how many
hoops I had to jump through

26:39.989 --> 26:41.600
just to fix that?

26:41.687 --> 26:44.037
I begged for mercy, man,
and I do not like to beg.

26:44.124 --> 26:46.213
Nicely spun, okay?

26:46.300 --> 26:48.171
Chilled to the bone.
But you know what?

26:48.258 --> 26:50.130
I don't have enough time
to be having

26:50.217 --> 26:52.741
another visitation from
ghosts of Christmas present,

26:52.828 --> 26:55.135
past, or whoever you are.

26:58.094 --> 26:59.356
Stanley!

26:59.443 --> 27:01.968
Wait! Don't do it! Please!

27:02.055 --> 27:03.186
All right, who's Stanley?

27:07.626 --> 27:09.323
And I'm not a damn ghost.

27:12.021 --> 27:14.371
No ghost.

27:14.458 --> 27:16.199
Just me.

27:16.286 --> 27:19.028
So you're not a projection
of my subconscious mind

27:19.115 --> 27:21.248
who thinks I'm an asshole?

27:21.335 --> 27:22.858
I'm not a projection.

27:22.945 --> 27:24.381
I see what you did there.

27:24.468 --> 27:25.774
Well, the way
you've been acting lately,

27:25.861 --> 27:26.906
it's sort of hard
not to think--

27:26.993 --> 27:28.734
Are you really you?

27:28.821 --> 27:31.127
Yeah.

27:31.214 --> 27:32.433
In the flesh.

27:34.348 --> 27:36.698
You would not believe
the shit I've seen.

27:41.050 --> 27:43.923
Hey, that's not
how elevators operate.

27:44.010 --> 27:46.577
It brought me this far.
It can send me to him.

27:46.665 --> 27:51.191
But how exactly
does that work?

27:51.278 --> 27:55.151
I'm thinking blind faith,
but that's just a guess.

27:55.238 --> 27:56.849
How did you even get in here?

27:56.936 --> 27:58.459
I took the stairs.

27:58.546 --> 28:00.374
I passed the test,
so you didn't have to?

28:00.461 --> 28:02.202
What about the ballroom?

28:02.289 --> 28:04.160
The bartender? Jenkins?

28:04.247 --> 28:06.119
Look, I don't know
what you're talking about,

28:06.206 --> 28:07.424
but we need to get home now.

28:07.511 --> 28:09.470
I can't.

28:09.557 --> 28:11.602
Stanley may be
a figment of the past,

28:11.690 --> 28:14.388
but I have to try and stop him
before he kills Abraham.

28:14.475 --> 28:16.477
- The Abraham?
- It's a long story.

28:16.564 --> 28:18.131
But the assessment's
in five days, man,

28:18.218 --> 28:19.741
and they're not gonna
reschedule again.

28:19.828 --> 28:21.787
We need to get back home.

28:21.874 --> 28:24.050
Begging for mercy
was a one-time deal.

28:24.137 --> 28:25.747
I'm not gonna do
the assessment.

28:25.834 --> 28:27.706
- You don't have a choice.
- Sure I do.

28:27.793 --> 28:29.316
If I'm not a vampire anymore,

28:29.403 --> 28:31.231
there's no reason
for me to take it.

28:31.318 --> 28:32.188
What the hell will you be?

28:32.275 --> 28:33.886
Human!

28:33.973 --> 28:35.365
That's why I'm here--

28:35.452 --> 28:37.367
to ask Abraham
to make me human again.

28:37.454 --> 28:39.543
Reggie, look,
one thing I can guarantee you

28:39.630 --> 28:41.110
is that no one,

28:41.197 --> 28:43.634
not even Abraham,
can do that, okay?

28:43.722 --> 28:46.507
He's not the Wizard of Oz.

28:46.594 --> 28:48.074
He's not God.

28:48.161 --> 28:50.119
The Wizard of Oz
was a congenial fraud.

28:50.206 --> 28:51.642
But God's on the menu?

28:51.730 --> 28:53.427
I may have sent out a prayer.

28:53.514 --> 28:54.602
You said you were an atheist.

28:54.689 --> 28:56.735
I changed my mind!

28:56.822 --> 28:59.650
Maurice, I just--

28:59.738 --> 29:01.740
I want to believe in something
bigger than myself--

29:01.827 --> 29:03.263
greater!

29:03.350 --> 29:04.612
You'll never find yourself
that way.

29:04.699 --> 29:05.831
I don't know what else to do.

29:05.918 --> 29:07.702
Change your point of view.

29:07.789 --> 29:09.182
Okay, look inside.

29:09.269 --> 29:10.749
I already know
what's inside--

29:10.836 --> 29:13.403
a vicious, lying,
bloodsucking monster.

29:13.490 --> 29:15.754
Hey, nobody's perfect, okay?

29:15.841 --> 29:17.799
But that doesn't mean
you can't--

29:17.886 --> 29:19.148
Maurice?

29:19.235 --> 29:20.759
I-- I think we have company.

29:23.283 --> 29:24.937
That is some strange shit, man.

29:25.024 --> 29:28.027
A lot of strange shit
has been happening tonight.

29:28.114 --> 29:29.506
I don't know
whether to fight them

29:29.593 --> 29:31.595
or to give them
Halloween candy.

29:31.682 --> 29:33.293
They're not
what they look like.

29:33.380 --> 29:35.599
Cliches that make
the rest of us look ridiculous?

29:35.686 --> 29:37.253
Ever since I got here,

29:37.340 --> 29:38.602
this place has been trying
to get rid of me.

29:38.689 --> 29:40.256
Attacking me like a virus.

29:40.343 --> 29:42.171
At first,
it was white blood cells.

29:42.258 --> 29:44.739
But now it looks like they're
bringing out the big guns.

29:44.826 --> 29:46.349
They're not vampires.

29:46.436 --> 29:48.395
They're the badasses
of white blood cells.

29:48.482 --> 29:50.310
They're monocytes.
- Okay, then.

29:50.397 --> 29:52.747
What's the plan?

29:52.834 --> 29:54.488
Elevator.

29:54.575 --> 29:55.924
You've gotta be kidding me.

29:56.011 --> 29:58.535
40 whatchamacallit-cytes
on one hand

29:58.622 --> 30:00.886
and a burning hellfire on that?

30:00.973 --> 30:02.278
What is funny to you?

30:02.365 --> 30:04.150
- It's an obstacle.
- No shit!

30:04.237 --> 30:06.108
Why would it present itself
if it can't be overcome?

30:06.195 --> 30:07.675
No, no, I'm gonna hate

30:07.762 --> 30:09.111
what you're thinking right now,
aren't I?

30:09.198 --> 30:11.157
- Blind faith.
- That's crazy.

30:11.244 --> 30:12.811
Crazy,
but it's the only way out--

30:12.898 --> 30:14.160
or in, or up.

30:14.247 --> 30:15.726
I don't know, Reggie.

30:15.814 --> 30:16.815
Trust me.

30:25.911 --> 30:27.564
You just pulled me
into hellfire, man!

30:27.651 --> 30:29.871
Blind faith!
We took a leap and we survived!

30:29.958 --> 30:31.351
No, don't ever
do that to me again.

30:31.438 --> 30:32.526
Don't worry,
I'm pretty sure hellfire

30:32.613 --> 30:34.354
is a one-time thing.

30:34.441 --> 30:36.225
There he is!

30:36.312 --> 30:38.184
- There who is?
- Stanley!

30:38.271 --> 30:40.577
We have to stop him
before he kills Abraham.

30:40.664 --> 30:43.406
Wait, you mean
Abraham's really here?

30:51.066 --> 30:52.546
We're too late.

30:52.633 --> 30:54.374
It already happened.

30:57.159 --> 31:00.946
Stanley was just a ghost
on a memory loop?

31:01.033 --> 31:03.818
Abraham never had a chance.

31:03.905 --> 31:06.081
I don't know, man.

31:06.168 --> 31:07.909
I mean, he's still here.

31:07.996 --> 31:09.345
He's not dust.

31:09.432 --> 31:11.434
Shh.

31:11.521 --> 31:13.088
Listen.

31:16.265 --> 31:18.137
He's alive!

31:18.224 --> 31:22.184
Yo, he stopped the stake
before it hit his heart.

31:22.271 --> 31:23.751
Damn!

31:23.838 --> 31:25.840
That's--that's skill, man.

31:25.927 --> 31:27.842
He didn't just stop
his own murder.

31:27.929 --> 31:30.062
He stopped time.

31:30.149 --> 31:31.498
He made all these obstacles
to protect himself

31:31.585 --> 31:32.716
while he was waiting for...

31:32.803 --> 31:34.849
What? The chosen one?

31:34.936 --> 31:36.938
A hero.

31:37.025 --> 31:39.158
That's what Jenkins said.

31:40.811 --> 31:43.423
Maurice, it's you.

31:43.510 --> 31:45.294
You're the hero!

31:45.381 --> 31:47.035
Nah.

31:47.122 --> 31:48.471
Nah, I don't think so, Reggie.

31:48.558 --> 31:51.039
You are! You must be!

31:51.126 --> 31:52.258
Take the stake
out of his chest.

31:52.345 --> 31:54.129
It's the only way to save him.

31:54.216 --> 31:55.696
Look, there's no guarantee
that if I take the stake--

31:55.783 --> 31:57.176
Please!

32:14.367 --> 32:16.935
Shit.

32:17.022 --> 32:18.458
Nah, that's not--
that's not gonna budge.

32:18.545 --> 32:20.939
Try it again.
Put your heart in it.

32:33.734 --> 32:36.171
No, I'm sorry, man, that's--

32:36.258 --> 32:38.521
that thing is buried
in stone or something.

32:38.608 --> 32:41.437
Another dead end.

32:41.524 --> 32:42.873
Literally.

32:45.833 --> 32:47.530
Hey.

32:47.617 --> 32:49.315
You said
there's obstacles, right?

32:49.402 --> 32:51.404
But you overcame them all?

32:51.491 --> 32:53.667
Yeah, only to fail.

32:53.754 --> 32:56.887
It's like the story of my life.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.933
But you write your own story.

33:00.979 --> 33:03.198
Props
for the positive thinking.

33:03.285 --> 33:06.506
You need Abraham, right?

33:06.593 --> 33:08.856
And Abraham needs a hero.

33:08.943 --> 33:11.293
Okay, I'm with you so far.

33:11.380 --> 33:12.512
It's you!

33:12.599 --> 33:14.209
Me? What?

33:14.296 --> 33:15.515
Reggie, you're the hero.

33:15.602 --> 33:17.386
No, I keep telling everyone,

33:17.473 --> 33:19.214
I am not a hero!

33:19.301 --> 33:21.347
How do you think
you made it this far?

33:21.434 --> 33:23.697
You can do this, man.

33:23.784 --> 33:25.438
I know you can.

33:46.415 --> 33:48.765
Yeah, you did it!

33:48.852 --> 33:50.071
You did it, man!
You really did it!

33:50.158 --> 33:51.638
You are the hero!

33:51.725 --> 33:54.249
Or, in fairness,
just a gifted amateur

33:54.336 --> 33:56.208
who was at the right place
at the right--

34:02.736 --> 34:04.129
Whoo!

34:04.216 --> 34:06.653
Now that was a trip.

34:06.740 --> 34:08.742
Your voice.

34:08.829 --> 34:12.050
It was in Jenkins,
and the bartender too.

34:12.137 --> 34:15.227
Just a couple beacons
from my subconscious mind.

34:15.314 --> 34:19.057
So the ballroom,
the bartender, the corridor,

34:19.144 --> 34:20.623
that was all you?

34:20.710 --> 34:22.147
If you're gonna have
a security system,

34:22.234 --> 34:24.192
might as well
make it interesting.

34:24.279 --> 34:26.281
But stopping time?

34:26.368 --> 34:29.110
I mean, that's a whole
new ballpark for vampires.

34:29.197 --> 34:30.677
Guess that's
what makes me a legend.

34:32.766 --> 34:35.551
But vampire is
only half my story.

34:35.638 --> 34:36.987
You want a drink?

34:37.075 --> 34:38.380
I'm parched.

34:52.438 --> 34:54.918
No.

35:02.752 --> 35:04.102
Rum it is.

35:08.062 --> 35:10.891
Okay, so if "vampire"
is only half the story,

35:10.978 --> 35:11.892
what's the other half?

35:11.979 --> 35:13.502
Ah!

35:16.201 --> 35:18.594
Whoo!

35:18.681 --> 35:21.467
I'm what you call a Nephilim.

35:21.554 --> 35:23.773
Half vampire, half archangel.

35:23.860 --> 35:26.472
So I got an extra
"whoo-whoo" in the tank,

35:26.559 --> 35:27.908
if you know what I mean.

35:31.390 --> 35:35.437
How is that possible?
Like, angels and vampires...

35:35.524 --> 35:37.831
You boys are familiar
with the big book, yeah?

35:37.918 --> 35:39.093
The Bible?

35:39.180 --> 35:41.487
That's the one.

35:41.574 --> 35:44.316
But there's a few details
that got left out,

35:44.403 --> 35:47.057
redacted by the faithful.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.494
See, there are
two brothers, right?

35:48.581 --> 35:50.365
Cain and Abel.

35:50.452 --> 35:52.802
Always wanted
what the other got.

35:52.889 --> 35:55.153
So Cain slew Abel.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.677
But that's not
the end of the story.

35:57.764 --> 36:01.594
See, God had some feelings
about that.

36:01.681 --> 36:04.336
So he went ahead
and resurrected Abel.

36:04.423 --> 36:07.904
And what did Abel do
with his resurrected life?

36:07.991 --> 36:10.994
He just went ahead
and killed Cain.

36:11.081 --> 36:15.738
So God, pretty good guy
on all accounts,

36:15.825 --> 36:18.698
he decided to resurrect Cain,

36:18.785 --> 36:21.353
like he did his brother, Abel.

36:21.440 --> 36:25.313
And what did he get
for his good deed?

36:25.400 --> 36:28.490
An endless cycle of murder
and resurrection,

36:28.577 --> 36:30.623
which became a pain
in God's ass!

36:33.452 --> 36:35.628
So God,

36:35.715 --> 36:38.892
problem-solver
of the first order,

36:38.979 --> 36:41.373
divided the world.

36:41.460 --> 36:43.723
He gave Abel the light

36:43.810 --> 36:46.421
and Cain the dark.

36:46.508 --> 36:49.032
That's how vampires were born.

36:49.119 --> 36:51.861
Creatures of the night,

36:51.948 --> 36:55.038
descendants
of the first killer.

36:55.125 --> 36:56.866
And humans were
the descendants of Abel,

36:56.953 --> 36:59.608
the first victim.

36:59.695 --> 37:01.958
Story as old as time.

37:05.788 --> 37:09.575
So what are you gonna do now?

37:09.662 --> 37:11.185
I'm thinking Florida.

37:11.272 --> 37:12.665
Hey, trust me.

37:12.752 --> 37:14.057
You don't want to go there.

37:21.935 --> 37:24.111
Still works.

37:24.198 --> 37:26.505
Sweet.

37:30.030 --> 37:31.814
♪ Ooh-hoo ♪

37:31.901 --> 37:33.729
What about Logan
the Capricious?

37:36.428 --> 37:38.212
That asshole still around?

37:38.299 --> 37:39.300
He took your seat
on the council,

37:39.387 --> 37:41.041
and he tried to murder you.

37:41.128 --> 37:43.826
Yeah,
dude's pretty messed up.

37:43.913 --> 37:45.785
But politics ain't for me.

37:45.872 --> 37:47.787
Too dirty.

37:47.874 --> 37:50.355
It'll make a monster
out of you.

37:50.442 --> 37:52.400
I think I'm gonna travel.

37:52.487 --> 37:54.794
Venice still above sea level?

37:54.881 --> 37:57.405
Yeah, it's hanging on
by a thread.

37:57.492 --> 38:00.713
Sounds like I'm gon'
get me on a plane.

38:00.800 --> 38:02.976
Feed them pigeons
that perch on your arm.

38:05.674 --> 38:08.503
Whoo!

38:08.590 --> 38:10.810
I love that shit.

38:10.897 --> 38:13.378
But before I do,

38:13.465 --> 38:17.904
you saved me from an eternity
of my own self-imprisonment.

38:17.991 --> 38:20.123
Tell me, Reginald,
how may I be of service?

38:22.648 --> 38:25.694
I want you
to make me human again.

38:25.781 --> 38:28.262
Aww, shoot, dude.

38:28.349 --> 38:29.655
Dude!

38:29.742 --> 38:31.874
Dude!

38:31.961 --> 38:33.485
Dude.

38:33.572 --> 38:34.964
Dude.

38:38.446 --> 38:41.623
Now, I'm the closest thing
to a god as they come,

38:41.710 --> 38:45.410
except for
the actual G-O-D himself,

38:45.497 --> 38:49.544
but that request you're asking
is way above my pay grade.

38:49.631 --> 38:50.806
Wait, wait, wait.

38:50.893 --> 38:52.765
You can't help me?

38:52.852 --> 38:54.506
Not with that, no.

38:58.858 --> 39:01.295
I--I came here for nothing.

39:01.382 --> 39:04.080
Define "nothing."

39:04.167 --> 39:05.778
Well--

39:05.865 --> 39:07.823
Pulling a sword
from a stone isn't nothing,

39:07.910 --> 39:09.956
historically speaking.

39:10.043 --> 39:11.653
And all those obstacles
you beat,

39:11.740 --> 39:15.265
no one's ever beat them ever.

39:15.353 --> 39:19.748
And sure, life is gonna
test you, again and again,

39:19.835 --> 39:22.577
but I'm pretty sure
you're ready to pass every one.

39:22.664 --> 39:24.623
Look, I appreciate
the pep talk,

39:24.710 --> 39:26.668
but I don't usually test well.

39:26.755 --> 39:29.758
Now, I've met
a lot of vampires in my day,

39:29.845 --> 39:31.934
but I haven't met
anyone like you.

39:32.021 --> 39:34.459
Not once.

39:34.546 --> 39:38.637
And I know a thing or two
about that kind of difference.

39:38.724 --> 39:40.290
Hmm.

39:40.378 --> 39:43.816
Hey, bright side,

39:43.903 --> 39:45.948
you kind of sucked at the whole
"being human" thing anyways.

39:46.035 --> 39:47.646
Whoa.

39:47.733 --> 39:49.256
And it turns out
that you might actually be

39:49.343 --> 39:53.260
the special kind
of vampire after all.

39:53.347 --> 39:54.392
Like the mother------- kind?

39:54.479 --> 39:55.610
Hey.

39:55.697 --> 39:57.003
I told you from day one.

40:04.576 --> 40:06.665
Maurice.

40:06.752 --> 40:08.884
Yeah?

40:08.971 --> 40:12.366
You need to know,
your mom and your family,

40:12.453 --> 40:14.020
they're in a good place.

40:16.892 --> 40:17.893
Thank you.

40:32.342 --> 40:34.040
Thank you, Abraham.

40:36.172 --> 40:38.523
You're my hero.

40:38.610 --> 40:42.091
You ever need anything,
I got you.

40:50.012 --> 40:52.014
Rock on, Reggie!

40:52.101 --> 40:54.408
Go on with your bad self!

40:54.495 --> 40:56.715
Maurice, you take care
of him now!

40:58.368 --> 41:00.022
Whoo-whoo!

41:02.590 --> 41:03.983
Whoo, it's good to be back!

41:14.123 --> 41:16.561
I'm ready
to go home, Maurice.

41:16.648 --> 41:19.389
There's amends to be made

41:19.477 --> 41:22.001
and mistakes to be corrected,

41:22.088 --> 41:24.264
but I'm ready
to face any challenge

41:24.351 --> 41:26.832
with a strong heart
and a steady hand.

41:28.486 --> 41:30.531
That's impressive,

41:30.618 --> 41:31.967
even if a little over the top.

41:33.969 --> 41:37.233
And look, um, I'm happy
you got your groove back, man.

41:39.061 --> 41:42.282
But Reggie, we still got
the assessment to deal with

41:42.369 --> 41:44.458
when we get back home.

41:44.545 --> 41:46.286
It's all copacetic.

41:46.373 --> 41:48.593
You know, it's all heaven-sent.

41:48.680 --> 41:51.030
It's all deeply
as it should be.

41:51.117 --> 41:52.379
You sound just like Abraham.

41:52.466 --> 41:54.076
I love that big dude!

41:58.254 --> 42:02.171
Reggie, look, I believe
you can pull this off.

42:02.258 --> 42:04.043
Well, I believe
there's a chance anyway,

42:04.130 --> 42:06.001
but I gotta be honest,

42:06.088 --> 42:09.657
we are probably both
gonna end up dead.

42:09.744 --> 42:11.616
What is it with you?

42:11.703 --> 42:13.008
Always with the dark side.

42:13.095 --> 42:14.532
Nah.

42:14.619 --> 42:15.576
Nah, man,
I'm just trying to keep it

42:15.663 --> 42:17.143
as real as possible, okay?

42:17.230 --> 42:18.927
I'm your biggest fan,
and you know that.

42:19.014 --> 42:21.843
I just--
- You know what it is?

42:21.930 --> 42:23.323
You're a dad.

42:23.410 --> 42:24.977
Like, you're totally a dad.

42:28.328 --> 42:31.418
Well, don't worry, Pops.

42:31.505 --> 42:32.985
I got you.

42:33.072 --> 42:34.377
I'll think of something.

42:34.464 --> 42:35.857
It's what I do.
