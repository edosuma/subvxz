01:39.720 --> 01:42.951
lt was a lovely funeral, Peggy.
l'm sure Buck would have been proud.

01:43.200 --> 01:46.112
l know. l just can't believe he's gone.

01:46.360 --> 01:49.796
You know, it seems like only yesterday
he was chewing up the furniture...

01:50.000 --> 01:51.831
...and peeing on the floor.

01:53.360 --> 01:55.476
That was yesterday.

01:57.760 --> 02:00.433
Your father seems to be taking it
especially hard.

02:00.680 --> 02:02.557
Poor guy.

02:03.520 --> 02:06.557
Twelve hundred bucks for a funeral.

02:11.280 --> 02:14.158
They buried King Tut for less...

02:14.800 --> 02:17.473
...and he got to take his wives
with him.

02:18.080 --> 02:20.674
l cannot believe
how cheap you are, Al.

02:20.880 --> 02:24.509
l mean, Buck was more than family.
He was someone we loved.

02:24.960 --> 02:28.509
That may well be, Peg,
but at $1200 for a 70-pound-dog...

02:28.720 --> 02:31.792
...do you realize how expensive
your mom's gonna be?

02:32.360 --> 02:36.273
l'd say bury her at sea
but then we'd have one less sea.

02:38.520 --> 02:41.193
All right, Al, you can say
what you want about Mom-

02:41.400 --> 02:42.753
Okay. She's a great big pile of-

02:42.960 --> 02:44.518
but...

02:46.200 --> 02:49.795
...l want you to be careful what you say
about Buck around Kelly.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.752
She was closer to him
than any of us...

02:51.960 --> 02:54.679
...and she's gonna need
some extra love and attention.

02:54.920 --> 02:56.433
Sorry l'm late.

02:56.680 --> 02:59.513
l stopped over at Hallmark
to see if l could get a nice...

02:59.760 --> 03:02.832
..."Thanks for leaving me
at the pet cemetery" card.

03:03.320 --> 03:07.108
Naturally they were all sold out,
so l'm gonna make up my own.

03:07.360 --> 03:13.037
What rhymes with " May you all heave
and gag on your own chunks"?

03:13.360 --> 03:19.674
Well, let's see.
There's punks, drunks, hunks.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.633
So how did you get home, Kel?

03:21.880 --> 03:26.078
Oh, l got a ride from lgor,
the guy who drives the doggy hearse.

03:26.320 --> 03:29.835
You know, the one that Dad was too
cheap to spend the extra 40 bucks on?

03:30.080 --> 03:33.197
There's nothing wrong with the trunk
of the Dodge.

03:34.520 --> 03:37.717
Buck always liked
going for a nice ride in the car...

03:37.920 --> 03:39.876
...and he looked so peaceful...

03:40.120 --> 03:42.998
...with his head propped up
on the spare tire.

03:44.360 --> 03:45.998
So how are you feeling, Kelly?

03:46.240 --> 03:48.674
Oh, l'm better, l guess.

03:48.880 --> 03:52.077
l think l'm over Buck's death now
and l'm ready to get on with my life.

03:52.320 --> 03:54.880
Attagirl, pumpkin.

03:55.120 --> 03:56.633
l admire your courage.

03:56.880 --> 03:59.952
Now help me clean up the yard
and we'll burn Buck's old toys.

04:01.560 --> 04:05.712
And to think, l could have had
any man on the football team.

04:06.440 --> 04:08.829
Peg, you've had them all.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.629
Now, pumpkin.
Now, you know that l loved Buck...

04:16.839 --> 04:19.353
...more than l love anyone
in this room.

04:20.399 --> 04:23.278
Way, way more than some.

04:23.520 --> 04:26.239
But, sweetheart,
let's not dwell on sad things.

04:26.480 --> 04:29.950
Daddy, what do you think
Buck's doing right now?

04:30.840 --> 04:32.910
Well, gee, l don't know, sweetheart.

04:33.200 --> 04:35.270
He should still be dead,
shouldn't he?

04:38.120 --> 04:40.031
Oh, Buck.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.589
Buck, where for art thou, Bucky-o?

04:43.880 --> 04:46.792
Where? Where?

04:59.080 --> 05:00.798
Well, I'll be damned.

05:01.040 --> 05:03.679
I really can see my house from here.

05:04.760 --> 05:08.036
Bundy? Bundy?

05:08.280 --> 05:11.113
Buck Bundy?

05:15.480 --> 05:19.393
-That's me.
-l'm Thomas, your guide.

05:20.480 --> 05:21.754
Where exactly am I?

05:22.000 --> 05:24.639
You're where animals go
when they die.

05:24.880 --> 05:27.519
I'm in Oprah's refrigerator?

05:32.080 --> 05:35.038
No, Buck,
you're in the animal afterlife.

05:35.280 --> 05:37.032
Well, then what are you doing here?

05:37.280 --> 05:39.430
Computer error.

05:41.320 --> 05:43.675
l was the mascot
for a baseball team...

05:43.920 --> 05:46.195
...the Cleveland Chickens.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.192
l had this really great bit...

05:48.400 --> 05:52.552
...where l'd find some guy
bald as an egg and sit on his head.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.518
A scream, l tell you.

05:54.760 --> 05:59.231
Until one day l met a bald guy
who was a tad sensitive about it.

05:59.480 --> 06:03.393
-Oh, what did he do?
-Shot me in the face six times.

06:06.160 --> 06:08.594
-What's that?
-Gabriel's beeper.

06:08.840 --> 06:11.991
That means it's time for the judge
to determine your fate.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.236
lf you've been good,
you'll be reincarnated...

06:14.440 --> 06:15.998
...as the animal of your choice.

06:16.440 --> 06:19.557
Well, in that case,
I'd lik e to come back as an eagle...

06:19.800 --> 06:21.836
...soaring proud and free.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.991
How patriotic.

06:24.240 --> 06:27.437
But if you do come back as an eagle,
do yourself a favour.

06:27.680 --> 06:32.071
-What's that?
-Don't land on any bald guys with guns.

06:40.160 --> 06:42.151
So, pumpkin...

06:42.400 --> 06:46.678
...just know that Buck
is in a happier place now.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.476
He has to be. He's not here.

06:50.360 --> 06:53.352
And as long as you carry him
in your heart...

06:53.640 --> 06:56.074
...a part of him will ways be with you.

06:56.520 --> 06:59.398
That was beautiful, Daddy.
l feel a lot better now.

06:59.600 --> 07:01.750
-Thanks.
-No problem, sweetheart.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.073
Bud, help me chop up the doghouse
for firewood.

07:07.680 --> 07:09.272
What now?

07:09.520 --> 07:12.717
Daddy, we are not going to get rid
of anything that was Buck's.

07:12.960 --> 07:16.157
He will ways be a part
of this family, always.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.710
l think you're gonna
have to get a replacement.

07:20.960 --> 07:24.316
Are you serious? Where am l
gonna get another daughter?

07:25.960 --> 07:28.793
Dad, l think she meant
a replacement for Buck.

07:29.040 --> 07:30.871
l can't afford a pet
since Peg's mom...

07:31.120 --> 07:34.271
...a.k.a. Free Willy,
beached herself upstairs.

07:38.920 --> 07:40.558
l am not beached.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.837
l can roll over if l want to.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.957
Don't!

07:49.040 --> 07:52.874
Hey, l've got a great idea.
l have a friend who owns a pet store.

07:53.120 --> 07:55.236
Well, actually he's a crooked
customs agent...

07:55.440 --> 07:58.273
...who smuggles in
endangered species...

07:58.520 --> 08:01.512
...and some really great
imported porn.

08:09.360 --> 08:11.476
l mean corn.

08:14.280 --> 08:17.078
Wait a second,
how much does this porn, l mean-

08:18.680 --> 08:20.432
How much is this pet gonna cost?

08:21.320 --> 08:22.514
Gee, l don't know, Al.

08:22.760 --> 08:25.638
What's the spending limit
on Kelly's peace of mind?

08:30.440 --> 08:32.431
Eleven bucks.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.558
No, you don't, Al Bundy.

08:34.799 --> 08:36.836
You're not gonna Scrooge your way
out of this.

08:37.039 --> 08:38.917
Kelly is your only daughter.

08:39.159 --> 08:41.832
This is my only $11, Peg.

08:43.200 --> 08:47.352
All right. l promise to get her
a pet that she'll love.

08:53.680 --> 08:54.954
So, Kelly...

08:55.200 --> 08:58.954
...tell me which one of these cool pets
is gonna be the new Buck?

09:00.440 --> 09:02.158
Oh, forget it, Daddy.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.755
l can't take a goldfish on a walk.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.958
l can't scratch a moth
behind its ears...

09:08.200 --> 09:11.670
...and l can't teach an ant farm
to pee in Bud's shoes.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.758
Kelly, have we got the pet for you.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.355
-What is it this time?
-A bird.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.795
lt takes one to buy one.

09:27.640 --> 09:29.232
But this isn't just any bird, Kel.

09:29.480 --> 09:32.199
This is a genuine Venezuelan
emerald-crested cockatoo.

09:32.440 --> 09:34.112
He does great celebrity impressions.

09:34.360 --> 09:37.716
And he knows
over 150 different words.

09:37.960 --> 09:40.918
That's got your father beat
right there.

09:41.720 --> 09:43.472
Yeah, but he's not Buck.

09:43.720 --> 09:45.233
Can he roll over and play dead?

09:45.480 --> 09:46.754
Buck couldn't do that.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.797
Until now.

09:54.920 --> 09:58.117
Look, Kelly, l know he's not Buck
but you should give him a chance.

09:58.360 --> 09:59.713
We got him on approval...

09:59.920 --> 10:02.639
...so if you don't want him
after a week, he goes back.

10:02.880 --> 10:04.711
Look.

10:04.960 --> 10:07.679
Kelly pretty, Kelly pretty.

10:07.920 --> 10:13.040
Well, he is awfully cute and smart.

10:15.480 --> 10:17.755
Hey there, cute little guy.

10:18.040 --> 10:21.430
-How much?
-A thousand dollars.

10:25.680 --> 10:28.399
Well, l'll give him a try.

10:28.640 --> 10:31.438
l just hope it's okay with Buck.

10:37.960 --> 10:41.350
I'm gonna be an eagle.
I'm gonna be an eagle.

10:41.920 --> 10:44.559
lf the judge decides
that you've been good.

10:44.800 --> 10:47.075
Oh, he will. Everybody loves me.

10:47.320 --> 10:50.756
All rise for the Honourable
Judge Felix D. Katt.

10:56.360 --> 11:00.831
Well, I just hope I get a defence lawyer
who can stand up to a cat.

11:01.080 --> 11:02.399
Buck Bundy?

11:02.640 --> 11:05.473
Ira Mousek ewitz.
I'm your court-appointed attorney.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.753
Houston, we have a problem.

11:16.880 --> 11:18.757
l hope Tweety likes the gifts
we got him.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.672
Yeah, it will be just like Christmas.

11:20.920 --> 11:24.196
Yeah, except Dad's sober
and somebody's getting presents.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.759
Well, l guess it's true
what they say.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.878
Nothing brings a family together
like a new pet.

11:42.560 --> 11:46.314
-Al, you busted Tweety's bird food.
-That's no problem.

11:46.520 --> 11:50.149
l was on my way back to town
to have a hernia operation anyway.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.955
Can l get anybody else
a hundred pounds of anything?

11:53.200 --> 11:55.430
Jujubes.

11:57.560 --> 11:59.994
l'm gonna give Tweety
his cuddle bone.

12:02.440 --> 12:06.149
-Hey, where'd he go?
-Somebody left the cage open.

12:06.400 --> 12:09.676
-He must have flown upstairs.
-Upstairs?

12:11.000 --> 12:12.513
Oh, no.

12:15.480 --> 12:18.040
Oh, my God, a feather.

12:19.160 --> 12:23.995
Gee, l was wondering
why Mom sent out for white wine.

12:25.640 --> 12:28.074
What do you mean
you thought it was a chicken?

12:29.480 --> 12:31.471
When was the last time
you heard a chicken...

12:31.680 --> 12:33.432
...doing a Marlon Brando impression?

12:34.240 --> 12:35.559
Tweety.

12:46.120 --> 12:47.951
Well...

12:50.960 --> 12:53.793
...l've got some good news
and got some bad news.

12:55.200 --> 12:58.351
The good news is
Tweety knew over 150 words.

12:59.480 --> 13:02.472
Well, what's the-?
What's the bad news, Dad?

13:03.600 --> 13:07.878
Bad news is none of them were
" Please don't eat me."

13:14.520 --> 13:17.034
Oh, there, there, sweetheart.

13:17.280 --> 13:21.558
-Daddy will get you a new Tweety.
-Like hell Daddy will.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.477
l don't want another Tweety.

13:24.720 --> 13:28.429
l don't want another anything.
l just want Buck back.

13:28.680 --> 13:31.478
-Now, look Kel-
-No, leave me alone!

13:32.640 --> 13:35.518
-Al, l've got another idea.
-Forget about it, Marcie.

13:36.120 --> 13:39.476
There's no pet in the world
wouldn't fit in that woman's mouth.

13:41.720 --> 13:45.030
She can unhinge her jaw
like an anaconda.

13:46.520 --> 13:48.636
Kelly's problem is that
she needs closure...

13:48.880 --> 13:51.713
...to reconcile herself
to the fact that Buck is really gone.

13:51.960 --> 13:54.030
She needs to communicate with him.

13:54.280 --> 13:56.635
But he's dead.

13:56.880 --> 13:59.872
He may have crossed over
to the other side...

14:00.120 --> 14:02.270
...but he's not out of reach.

14:02.520 --> 14:06.911
Come on, Marcie. Let's get
this doggy seance on the road.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.750
Father, we're ready.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.033
Well, the house is blessed...

14:24.280 --> 14:28.159
...except for that big, fat
ugly she-demon up there.

14:30.560 --> 14:33.279
Father Sarducci,
can we talk to Buck now?

14:33.520 --> 14:37.798
Soon, my child with the diary
in the top drawer.

14:39.560 --> 14:40.834
Are you clairvoyant?

14:41.080 --> 14:43.878
No, l was just
going through your things.

14:46.040 --> 14:48.634
Let us all join hands.

14:52.160 --> 14:54.594
Al, you're not joining hands.

14:54.840 --> 14:57.798
What's the matter, Mr. Bundy,
you don't believe in the afterlife?

14:58.000 --> 15:03.279
No, it's not that, Father. lt's just that
l don't wanna hold my wife's hand.

15:06.920 --> 15:08.956
Come on, now. Calm down.

15:09.200 --> 15:13.113
lt is not easy to contact a dead dog.

15:13.360 --> 15:17.638
Fortunately, l have
my dead-dog whistle with me.

15:20.680 --> 15:21.999
Won't be long now.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.830
Maybe gonna try something else.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.873
l got this idea.
How about everybody concentrate?

15:36.120 --> 15:38.190
Okay, concentrate.
You just have to...

15:43.520 --> 15:45.795
Buck Bundy, Buck Bundy.

15:49.360 --> 15:51.316
Yeah, l know.

15:52.520 --> 15:55.478
But in bed
l hardly have to do anything.

16:01.600 --> 16:05.388
-Silence?
-No, hardly. She's quite the screamer.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.552
He wasn't talking about that.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.552
Actually, l was.

16:12.240 --> 16:14.913
We are gathered here tonight
to contact a friend...

16:15.640 --> 16:19.519
...a departed friend,
who still carries heartstrings...

16:19.760 --> 16:23.799
...for his grieving companion,
the blond chick.

16:24.960 --> 16:27.030
-Kelly.
-Kelly.

16:27.280 --> 16:30.317
Buck, Buck...

16:30.520 --> 16:32.590
...hear me, Buck.

16:33.600 --> 16:36.034
Fill me up with thy spirit.

16:36.280 --> 16:38.874
My body is your vessel.

16:39.280 --> 16:41.396
Fill me up, Buck.

16:41.640 --> 16:43.710
Fill me up.

16:48.840 --> 16:51.991
Am l the only one
getting turned on here?

16:56.120 --> 16:58.714
What is it, Father?
What do you feel?

16:58.960 --> 17:00.473
Great fear.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.234
l think Buck's in trouble.

17:04.880 --> 17:08.395
Buck Bundy, I understand you have
waived your right to an attorney.

17:08.640 --> 17:10.756
Yeah, after you ate him.

17:13.160 --> 17:14.832
Strik e that from the record.

17:15.079 --> 17:18.675
Thomas shall now read aloud
from The Book of Life.

17:20.119 --> 17:25.114
Let's see. "Total number of cats
chased up trees, 15."

17:25.359 --> 17:28.193
It was harmless fun.
It's not lik e anyone got hurt.

17:28.440 --> 17:34.788
"Total number of cats chased under
the wheels of Mack trucks, 197."

17:36.160 --> 17:37.957
I'm truly sorry about that.

17:38.200 --> 17:41.829
I was a young pup
and I did it to impress the bitches.

17:43.600 --> 17:46.717
And finally,
"Total number of cats eaten...

17:46.920 --> 17:50.754
...this morning
in heaven's waiting room, three."

17:51.880 --> 17:55.509
-Well, dog?
-You know, I don't have to be an eagle.

17:55.760 --> 17:58.957
I'll settle for a finch with huev os
lik e an eagle.

18:00.520 --> 18:02.556
This court will recess for one hour...

18:02.800 --> 18:08.636
... while I contemplate the appropriate
sentence in my litter box.

18:09.600 --> 18:12.751
Well, this certainly sucks.

18:14.160 --> 18:17.709
Be one with me, oh, spirit.

18:17.960 --> 18:19.757
Join with me, Buck.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.798
Join with me.

18:27.040 --> 18:29.793
Now, look here, La Toya.

18:31.840 --> 18:33.558
lt has been over an hour.

18:33.760 --> 18:37.116
Get to the part where Buck is fine
and Kelly's happy.

18:37.360 --> 18:40.079
What, you want me to lie?
What do you take me for?

18:40.320 --> 18:43.278
A lot less than you're taking me for.
Now go ahead.

18:44.200 --> 18:47.795
Okay, l will again
attempt to break through.

18:48.040 --> 18:49.917
l broke through.

18:51.760 --> 18:53.239
Buck?

18:53.560 --> 18:56.916
Yes, it's me, Buck.

19:02.280 --> 19:03.713
Daddy...

19:03.960 --> 19:06.235
...Daddy, Buck's ltalian.

19:07.240 --> 19:09.231
The afterlife is in ltaly.

19:11.440 --> 19:14.238
-l miss you Buck.
-l miss you too, Kelly...

19:15.160 --> 19:18.038
...but l think it's time
for both of us to move on.

19:18.280 --> 19:21.590
Go forth, my child,
and get yourself another dog.

19:22.520 --> 19:24.397
A cheap dog.

19:25.640 --> 19:28.313
And, Kelly, share yourself
with others...

19:28.560 --> 19:32.109
...like you have shared yourself
with me, Buck.

19:32.360 --> 19:33.634
l'll do that.

19:33.880 --> 19:36.633
l will share myself with others.

19:44.440 --> 19:45.998
lf she shared herself any more...

19:46.200 --> 19:48.794
...she'd be traded on
the New York Stock Exchange.

19:52.360 --> 19:56.399
Now, before we say goodbye
is there anything l can do for you?

19:56.920 --> 20:01.118
Well, Buck would like
to have a little hug.

20:01.960 --> 20:04.520
Oh, of course.

20:06.560 --> 20:09.313
And maybe a little kiss.

20:10.680 --> 20:12.398
Okay.

20:14.040 --> 20:17.271
No, Buck would really like to have
his tongue involved.

20:19.480 --> 20:23.234
Would Buck like to have
a little shoe up his blowhole?

20:29.880 --> 20:31.598
The spirit has departed.

20:32.080 --> 20:34.230
Hey, hey, wait.
While you're still out there...

20:34.480 --> 20:37.278
...l used to have a pet goldfish
named Winky.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.715
Not on my dime you didn't, buddy.

20:41.880 --> 20:45.111
Hey. Hey, wait a minute, you guys.
Now, you heard what Buck said.

20:45.320 --> 20:46.912
He wants me to get another dog.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.588
But, pumpkin, it's after 9:00.
Daddy's broke.

20:49.840 --> 20:52.434
There's no way in the world
we can find another-

20:58.320 --> 21:01.437
Hey, wait a minute. What's that?

21:03.640 --> 21:04.993
Look, it's a puppy.

21:05.560 --> 21:06.993
Where did it come from?

21:07.240 --> 21:09.549
lt's a sign, a sign from Buck.

21:09.800 --> 21:11.711
That's ridiculous-

21:13.600 --> 21:15.670
Entirely possible.

21:15.960 --> 21:18.269
Oh, look how cute he is.

21:20.320 --> 21:23.312
Wait a minute, I'm not an eagle.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.348
I'm a dog.

21:28.600 --> 21:29.828
What should we name him?

21:30.080 --> 21:33.993
l know, let's call him Lucky,
Lucky Bundy.

21:34.240 --> 21:37.630
Gee, l was saving that name
for my tombstone.

21:40.520 --> 21:43.114
Those v oices sound oddly familiar.

21:43.360 --> 21:46.670
If I could just get these newborn eyes
to focus...

21:50.160 --> 21:55.518
No!
