WEBVTT

00:07.300 --> 00:09.633
( theme music playing )

00:14.700 --> 00:16.933
IT'S KIND
OF SMALL IN THERE.

00:16.967 --> 00:18.067
YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT FOR YOU

00:18.100 --> 00:20.100
IT'S FOR YOUR NANNY, RIGHT?

00:20.133 --> 00:21.500
IT'S FOR MY NANNY.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:21.533 --> 00:23.133
ALL RIGHT,
HOW MUCH?

00:23.167 --> 00:24.400
WHATEVER YOU THINK
IS FAIR.

00:24.433 --> 00:25.800
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

00:25.833 --> 00:27.000
I'M SHOCKED.

00:27.033 --> 00:29.367
ALL RIGHT, UM,

00:29.400 --> 00:30.500
YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:30.533 --> 00:31.867
I'LL FIND
THE BLUE BOOK VALUE

00:31.900 --> 00:33.800
AND THAT'S
WHAT I'LL GIVE YOU.

00:33.833 --> 00:36.367
- YOU GOT A DEAL,
MY BIG FRIEND.
- ALL RIGHT, MY FRIEND.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.533

CONGRATULATIONS.

00:38.567 --> 00:40.233

YOURSELF A GREAT CAR.

00:40.267 --> 00:44.133
HOLD ON A SECOND.
LOUIS LEWIS HAS JUST COME
OUT OF HIS COMA.

00:44.167 --> 00:46.700
OKAY, SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

00:52.200 --> 00:53.400
( Louis laughs )

00:53.433 --> 00:55.500
OH YEAH,
OH THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

00:55.533 --> 00:57.000
YEAH, NO, INVITE
ANYBODY YOU WANT.

00:57.033 --> 00:58.567
YEAH, LET'S GO
ALL THE WAY.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.833
OKAY, I'LL
SEE YOU TONIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, BYE.

01:00.867 --> 01:02.800
I'M GOING TO A PARTY TONIGHT

01:02.833 --> 01:05.600
MY FRIENDS ARE THROWING
FOR ME 'CAUSE I'M GETTING
OUT OF HERE,

01:05.633 --> 01:08.433
- AND I WOULD LIKE
YOU TO GO WITH ME.
- OKAY.

01:08.467 --> 01:10.667
- YES? WOW.
- YEAH.

01:10.700 --> 01:14.367
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO ABOUT YOUR COUSIN
WHO NEEDS A KIDNEY?

01:14.400 --> 01:15.867
- WHAT, RITCHIE?
- YEAH.

01:15.900 --> 01:18.533
WELL, SO WE'LL
FIND HIM A KIDNEY.

01:18.567 --> 01:21.167
- WHAT ABOUT YOURS?
- WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY?

01:21.200 --> 01:22.933
I'M NOT GIVING
ANYBODY MY KIDNEY.

01:22.967 --> 01:25.933
I JUST WOKE UP.
I'M GONNA GIVE
THINGS OUT NOW?

01:25.967 --> 01:28.200
- THAT'S VERY SELFISH.
- SELFISH?

01:28.233 --> 01:30.367
- YEAH.
- HEY, LET ME ASK
YOU A QUESTION.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.433
YOU KNOW, I HEARD
THAT YOU COME IN AND OUT

01:32.467 --> 01:34.633
OF HERE ALL THE TIME
AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.

01:34.667 --> 01:36.367
I HARDLY KNOW YOU.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.933
I MET YOU BRIEFLY ONCE
AT RITCHIE'S HOUSE

01:38.967 --> 01:40.933
AND THEY TELL ME
YOU'RE IN HERE ALL THE TIME.

01:40.967 --> 01:44.867
I VISIT PEOPLE IN THE HOSPITAL
AND I CHEER THEM UP.

01:44.900 --> 01:46.900
I GO AROUND,
I DO VOLUNTEER WORK.

01:46.933 --> 01:49.333
AND I KNEW YOU WERE HERE
SO I STOPPED IN TO SEE YOU.

01:49.367 --> 01:52.167
WELL I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHEER ME UP

01:52.200 --> 01:53.700
BECAUSE I'M CHEERED UP.

01:53.733 --> 01:55.500
IT PAYS TO BE IN A COMA,
I'M TELLING YOU.

01:55.533 --> 01:57.733
I'VE NEVER FELT
SO REFRESHED IN MY LIFE.

01:57.767 --> 02:00.600
- OH, REALLY?
- YOU KNOW THOSE BEARS,
THEY HAD IT RIGHT.

02:00.633 --> 02:02.100
THEY GO INTO HIBERNATION,

02:02.133 --> 02:04.267
THEY COME OUT
LIKE NEW BEARS.

02:04.300 --> 02:07.333
EVERYBODY SHOULD DO THIS.

02:07.367 --> 02:09.700
CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN
ON THE...

02:09.733 --> 02:19.767
GETTING OUT OF THE COMA.

02:19.767 --> 02:29.767
GETTING OUT OF THE COMA.

02:56.067 --> 02:58.900
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN
HIM WALKING DOWN THAT HALL.

02:58.933 --> 03:01.467
IT WAS LIKE
THE SPECTER OF DEATH.

03:01.500 --> 03:05.233
AND THEN HE PASSED ME
AND HE LOOKED AT ME.

03:05.267 --> 03:08.067
I'M HAUNTED BY THAT LOOK.

03:09.867 --> 03:13.200
HAVE YOU SEEN THE, UH,
CASE FOR THE SOPRANO'S DVD?

03:13.233 --> 03:15.400
NO.

03:15.433 --> 03:17.967
I CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE.

03:18.067 --> 03:20.267
DID YOU DO
SOMETHING WITH IT?

03:20.300 --> 03:22.067
NO, I DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING WITH IT.

03:22.067 --> 03:24.967
IF YOU'RE BLAMING THIS
ON ME, YOU'RE BARKING UP
THE WRONG TREE, OKAY?

03:25.067 --> 03:27.333
I HAVE A SYSTEM.
WHEN I WATCH A DVD,

03:27.367 --> 03:29.800
I PUT THE CASE ON TOP
OF THE DVD PLAYER.

03:29.833 --> 03:32.500
THEN WHEN I'M DONE,
I TAKE THE DVD,

03:32.533 --> 03:35.233
I PUT IT BACK IN THE CASE,
AND THEN I PUT IT BACK
ON THE SHELF.

03:35.267 --> 03:37.067
WELL, YOUR SYSTEM'S
BREAKING DOWN.

03:37.100 --> 03:40.400
- MY SYSTEM IS FOOLPROOF.
- THERE'S NO CASE ON TOP
OF THE DVD PLAYER.

03:40.433 --> 03:42.300
WELL, YOU'RE THE ONE,
PROBABLY,

03:42.333 --> 03:44.500
WHO TOOK IT OUT
AND DIDN'T PUT IT BACK.

03:44.533 --> 03:46.067
DON'T BLAME IT ON ME.

03:46.067 --> 03:48.567
I MEAN, I'M NOT EVEN
THAT FRIENDLY WITH HIM.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.467
YEAH, I KNOW HIM 44 YEARS,

03:50.500 --> 03:52.633
BUT WE'RE NOT REALLY
CLOSE FRIENDS.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.067
HE'S MORE
OF AN ACQUAINTANCE.

03:54.100 --> 03:56.100
WHO GIVES A KIDNEY
TO AN ACQUAINTANCE?

03:56.133 --> 03:59.333
I JUST FEEL LIKE IF WE'RE
GOING TO WATCH DVD'S

03:59.367 --> 04:01.133
THAT WE SHOULD KEEP
THE CASE NEARBY

04:01.167 --> 04:03.200
SO WE DON'T END
UP WITH JUST THE--

04:03.233 --> 04:06.600
DO YOU HAVE ANY SYMPATHY
FOR WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH?
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE YOU DO.

04:06.633 --> 04:08.333
( phone rings )

04:11.200 --> 04:13.200
HELLO?

04:14.800 --> 04:18.067
OH, OKAY, UM,

04:18.100 --> 04:20.967
YEAH, ALL RIGHT, I'LL--
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

04:21.067 --> 04:23.133
ALL RIGHT, THANKS.

04:23.167 --> 04:25.633
- HUH.
- WHAT?

04:25.667 --> 04:28.100
THAT WAS OMAR JONES.

04:28.133 --> 04:30.267
HE SAID HE HAS
SOME INFORMATION FOR ME.

04:30.300 --> 04:32.467
HE WANTS ME TO COME
TO THE OFFICE TOMORROW.

04:37.900 --> 04:40.833
SO, MR. DAVID, I'VE GOT SOME
VERY VERY INTERESTING NEWS

04:40.867 --> 04:43.133

04:43.167 --> 04:45.333

04:45.367 --> 04:47.367

04:47.400 --> 04:50.733
IN FACT, ADOPTED.

04:50.767 --> 04:53.933
NOW YOUR BIOLOGICAL PARENTS
ARE MR. AND MRS. CONE.

04:53.967 --> 04:57.833
AND THEY CURRENTLY RESIDE
IN BISBEE, ARIZONA.

04:57.867 --> 05:07.967
THEY'RE AWAITING YOUR CALL.

05:07.967 --> 05:16.667
THEY'RE AWAITING YOUR CALL.

05:40.067 --> 05:42.800
( silent )

05:51.067 --> 05:53.767
Stewardess:
PLEASE NOTICE THIS AIRCRAFT
HAS THREE EMERGENCY EXITS

05:53.800 --> 05:55.633
LOCATED IN THE REAR,
CENTER AND FORWARD SECTIONS

05:55.667 --> 05:57.267
OF THE CABIN.
PASSENGERS SEATED IN THESE...

05:57.300 --> 05:59.767
HI. UM, LISTEN,

05:59.800 --> 06:02.500
I CAN'T REALLY SIT HERE
BY THE EMERGENCY DOOR EXIT.

06:02.533 --> 06:03.833
I THINK YOU BETTER GET
SOMEONE ELSE.

06:03.867 --> 06:06.367
OKAY, SIR WE'RE ABOUT THREE
MINUTES AWAY FROM WHEELS UP.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.533
SO YOU NEED
TO JUST STAY PUT, OKAY?
'CAUSE WE GOT A FULL PLANE.

06:08.567 --> 06:11.633
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS WE
WON'T BE ABLE TO GET OUT.

06:11.667 --> 06:13.600
- CALM DOWN, OKAY?
- I CANNOT DO IT.

06:13.633 --> 06:16.100
I WILL PANIC.
WE WILL GO DOWN.

06:16.133 --> 06:18.133
ALL WE NEED TO KNOW
IS THAT YOU'RE WILLING
TO ASSIST

06:18.167 --> 06:20.133
PASSENGERS IN THE EVENT
OF A NON-TRADITIONAL LANDING.

06:20.167 --> 06:21.933
I CANNOT BE
OF ANY HELP WHATSOEVER

06:21.967 --> 06:24.967
IN ANY KIND
OF NON-TRADITIONAL LANDING
OR ANY TRADITIONAL LANDING.

06:25.067 --> 06:26.533
DID YOU READ THE BROCHURE?

06:26.567 --> 06:29.233
READ THE BROCHURE?
I CAN'T READ THAT BROCHURE.
IT'S CHINESE TO ME.

06:29.267 --> 06:32.100
I'M SORRY, ARE YOU CHINESE?
YOU LOOK A LITTLE ASIAN.
I'M SORRY.

06:32.133 --> 06:35.500
IT'S JUST AN EXPRESSION.
I DON'T THINK YOU ARE CHINESE.
YOU LOOK MAYBE THAI?

06:35.533 --> 06:38.067
OKAY, IS IT THE SEAT
OR ARE YOU JUST
SCARED TO FLY?

06:38.067 --> 06:40.900
NO, I CHOKE UNDER PRESSURE.
IN ANY KIND OF GAME--

06:40.933 --> 06:42.967
BASKETBALL, IF I WAS
ON THE FOUL LINE

06:43.067 --> 06:44.567
TOWARDS, LIKE THE LAST FIVE
MINUTES OF THE GAME,

06:44.600 --> 06:47.367
I WOULD MISS THE ENTIRE RIM.
I COULDN'T EVEN HIT THE RIM!

06:47.400 --> 06:49.633
'CAUSE I WAS CHOKING.
CHOKING.

06:49.667 --> 06:51.633
HOW ABOUT I GET YOU A DRINK?
WOULD YOU LIKE A MERLOT?

06:51.667 --> 06:53.167
NO THANK YOU, I DON'T DRINK.
I DON'T DRINK.

06:53.200 --> 06:54.833
JUST PLEASE FIND
SOMEBODY ELSE TO SIT HERE.

06:54.867 --> 06:58.833
I'LL LOOK FOR A SEAT FOR YOU
BUT YOU OWE ME ONE, MISTER.

06:58.867 --> 07:01.867
THANK YOU.
I MEAN, IT'S RIDICULOUS.
I DON'T WANT TO SIT HERE.

07:01.900 --> 07:03.933
WHY IS SHE
GIVING ME A HARD TIME?
JUST FIND SOMEBODY ELSE.

07:03.967 --> 07:05.700
WHO THE HELL KNOWS
HOW TO DO THIS THING?

07:05.733 --> 07:07.933
WHAT, PULL DOWN?
WHAT IS THAT GONNA DO?

07:07.967 --> 07:10.567
CAN I PULL DOWN?
DO YOU HAVE TO BE STRONG?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.567
THEN WHAT DO YOU DO?
YOU SMASH THIS THING?

07:12.600 --> 07:15.300
WHAT HAPPENS THEN?
THE DOOR JUST SUDDENLY
OPENS MIRACULOUSLY?

07:17.633 --> 07:20.067
YOU'RE NOT CHINESE.
YOU DON'T LOOK CHINESE.
WHAT ARE YOU, THAI?

07:20.067 --> 07:30.100
I THINK YOU'RE THAI.
YOU'RE THAI? I KNEW IT.

07:30.100 --> 07:39.067
I THINK YOU'RE THAI.
YOU'RE THAI? I KNEW IT.

07:57.367 --> 07:59.400
( doorbell rings )

08:05.400 --> 08:08.567
- SON.
- DAD.

08:12.967 --> 08:14.967
GOSH. COME ON IN.

08:26.967 --> 08:29.667
WELL, I HAD JUST COME
OUT OF THE NAVY AND, UH...

08:29.700 --> 08:33.067
- JUST GOTTEN OUT, YEAH.
- THAT'S RIGHT, WE MET
IN TIMES SQUARE.

08:33.067 --> 08:35.567
AND SHE WAS
THE PRETTIEST GIRL THERE

08:35.600 --> 08:37.133
SO I KISSED HER.

08:37.167 --> 08:40.100
AND, BEFORE LONG,

08:40.133 --> 08:41.500
WE HAD A BABY.

08:41.533 --> 08:44.400
BUT, WE DIDN'T
HAVE ANY MONEY AND...

08:44.433 --> 08:46.633
WELL, WE JUST DIDN'T
KNOW WHAT TO DO.

08:46.667 --> 08:48.300
WE WERE JUST SO YOUNG
AND JUST--

08:48.333 --> 08:49.933
- I UNDERSTAND.
- YOU KNOW?

08:49.967 --> 08:52.567
YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING
ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO YOU,

08:52.600 --> 08:54.633
UH, WHO, UH,
WHAT, ADOPTED ME?

08:54.667 --> 08:56.600
WHO ADOPTED YOU?
YEAH, WE MET THEM.

08:56.633 --> 08:59.400
THE GUY WAS A LITTLE
NERVOUS AND JUMPY.

08:59.433 --> 09:02.067
HE WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE.
JUMPY, FIDGETY.

09:02.067 --> 09:04.200
- ALL OVER THE PLACE.
- FIDGETY, HUH? FIDGETY GUY?

09:04.233 --> 09:05.533
- YEAH.
- ( whines )

09:05.567 --> 09:07.633
KIND OF TALKED
LIKE THAT A LITTLE BIT?

09:07.667 --> 09:09.667
- HE DID KIND OF.
- THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

09:09.700 --> 09:12.733
- HE REALLY HAS IT, DOESN'T HE?
- I REMEMBER THAT, YEAH.

09:12.767 --> 09:15.967
AND SHE WAS LOVELY,
BUT SHE WAS A LITTLE LOUD.

09:16.067 --> 09:18.533
BUT SHE-- SHE SORT
OF RULED THE ROOST.

09:18.567 --> 09:20.400
- OH YEAH.
- BUT YOU KNEW SHE WAS
A GOOD WOMAN.

09:20.433 --> 09:23.400
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO GET
ON THE WRONG SIDE
OF HER, THOUGH.

09:23.433 --> 09:26.467
- NO, YOU WOULDN'T.
- YEAH.

09:26.500 --> 09:29.867
AND THEY-- THEY WANTED
A BABY SO BADLY.

09:29.900 --> 09:33.433
TELL ME A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT WHERE YOU'RE FROM,
BROOKLYN?

09:33.467 --> 09:35.567
OH, NO NO NO.
I'M FROM ILLINOIS.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.367
YEAH, AND I'M
FROM VIRGINIA

09:37.400 --> 09:40.067
- I WAS BORN
AND RAISED IN VIRGINIA.
- THERE, YEAH.

09:40.067 --> 09:43.267
SO, SO WE'RE BOTH SORT
OF MIDWESTERN, SOUTHERN.

09:43.300 --> 09:47.633
MY PEOPLE CAME FROM,
OH, ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND.

09:47.667 --> 09:50.800
BEEN HERE
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS.

09:50.833 --> 09:53.467
HOW DO YOU SPELL
YOUR LAST NAME?

09:53.500 --> 09:55.833
Both:
C-O-N-E.

09:55.867 --> 09:58.667
( dramatic music playing )

10:10.533 --> 10:13.433
OH MY GOD.

10:13.467 --> 10:15.333
I'M GENTILE.

10:28.600 --> 10:31.300
HEY LOOK, DAVE.
HI DAVE, HOW YOU DOING?

10:31.333 --> 10:33.867
I WANT YOU TO MEET OUR SON.
THIS IS LARRY.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.867
- LARRY, NICE TO MEET YOU.
- HI, NICE TO MEET YOU, DAVE.

10:35.900 --> 10:38.767
- HOW ARE YOU TODAY?
- Mr. Cone: HE'S A CHEVROLET
DEALER HERE.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.467
HOW COME MY DAD
BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE?

10:40.500 --> 10:44.033
- I DON'T KNOW,
I CAN'T HELP THAT.
- I'M IN TROUBLE.

10:44.067 --> 10:45.933
- Woman: HI, JUNE.
- HI, JENNY.

10:45.967 --> 10:47.733
- HI JENNY.

10:47.767 --> 10:51.600

OH, I LOVE IT.

10:55.533 --> 10:58.400
- HEY, HI WILSON.
- HI.

10:58.433 --> 11:00.567
THIS IS OUR SON LARRY.

11:00.600 --> 11:03.067
- Larry: HI, WILSON.
- I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD A SON.

11:03.100 --> 11:06.167
- WE DO NOW.
- ARE YOU STICKING AROUND?

11:06.200 --> 11:09.200
- I THINK I MIGHT.
- Mr. Cone: ISN'T THAT NICE?

11:09.233 --> 11:12.600
- NICE LITTLE TOWN.
- YOU'RE GONNA LIKE IT HERE.

11:14.567 --> 11:16.433
- Larry: GOOD AFTERNOON.
- AFTERNOON.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.333
I NOTICED YOU'RE
SELLING YOUR CAR HERE.

11:18.367 --> 11:21.067
YEP, LETTER HER GO.
YOU INTERESTED?

11:21.067 --> 11:24.667
WELL, NO I'M NOT.
BUT MAY I ASK HOW YOU
ARRIVED AT THAT PRICE?

11:24.700 --> 11:26.600
Man:
SURE, THAT'S THE ACTUAL
BLUE BOOK VALUE.

11:26.633 --> 11:30.467
- THAT'S THE BLUE BOOK VALUE?
- YEAH, RIGHT THERE.

11:30.500 --> 11:34.367
HUH, I SOLD A PRIUS
TO A FRIEND OF MINE

11:34.400 --> 11:37.833
AND HE TOLD ME THE BLUE BOOK
VALUE WAS $5,000 LESS THAN THAT.

11:37.867 --> 11:39.700
( inhales )
OUCH.

11:42.467 --> 11:44.733
LARRY, WHAT'S WRONG?

11:46.767 --> 11:49.067
MY FRIEND TOOK
ADVANTAGE OF ME, MOM.

11:49.100 --> 11:52.167
OH, I KNOW IT HURTS SON,

11:52.200 --> 11:55.067
BUT YOU MUST PRACTICE
LOVE AND FORGIVENESS.

11:55.067 --> 11:58.333
GIVE HIM
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.
THAT'S WHAT JESUS WOULD DO.

12:06.067 --> 12:07.933
HEY, I GOTTA BITE, POP.

12:07.967 --> 12:09.800
I GOT-- I GOT IT.

12:24.533 --> 12:26.667

12:26.700 --> 12:28.167

12:36.967 --> 12:39.100

13:10.100 --> 13:13.067
WOW, THIS REALLY
LOOKS YUMMY.

13:13.067 --> 13:16.067
WE HAVE, WE HAVE TO SAY
GRACE FIRST, LARRY.

13:18.100 --> 13:21.933
DEAR LORD, WE THANK YOU

13:21.967 --> 13:24.333

13:32.967 --> 13:34.633
- AMEN.
- AMEN.

13:37.967 --> 13:40.233
- WHAT DO YOU GOT THERE?
- SIGN OF THE CROSS.

13:41.700 --> 13:44.467
OH, NOSE, TOES...

13:44.500 --> 13:46.833
- NOSE?
- ...AND WATCH, WALLET.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.933
NOSE, TOES--

13:48.967 --> 13:51.167
EXCEPT I KEEP MY WATCH
AND WALLET ON THE SAME SIDE.

13:51.200 --> 13:54.200
- I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA WORK.
- OH, LARRY. ( laughing )

13:54.233 --> 13:56.300
ALL RIGHT, NOSE, TOES,

13:56.333 --> 13:58.367
I'LL JUST MOVE MY WALLET
TO THE RIGHT SIDE.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.133
OH GOOD.
THAT'S SIMPLE.

14:00.167 --> 14:01.433
THAT'S IT, RIGHT?
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR.

14:01.467 --> 14:03.933
- RIGHT, THAT'S IT.
YOU HAVE IT.
- I KIND OF LIKE THAT.

14:03.967 --> 14:06.767
- YOU'VE GOT IT.
- HUH? THAT'S IT?

14:06.800 --> 14:08.867
THAT'S IT.
DIG IN, LARRY.

14:08.900 --> 14:11.200
ALL RIGHT.

14:12.067 --> 14:14.733
( church organ playing )

14:18.533 --> 14:21.367
Mrs. Cone: OH, LARRY.

14:21.400 --> 14:31.433
( singing "Go Tell It
On The Mountain" )

14:31.433 --> 14:41.433
( singing "Go Tell It
On The Mountain" )

15:20.067 --> 15:23.833
MY FRIENDS,
I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU

15:23.867 --> 15:27.267
ON THIS BEAUTIFUL
SUNDAY MORNING

15:27.300 --> 15:29.433
ABOUT A RELATIONSHIP
IN OUR LIVES

15:29.467 --> 15:32.500
THAT WE SOMETIMES
TAKE FOR GRANTED.

15:32.533 --> 15:35.067
WE HAVE OUR FAMILY.

15:35.067 --> 15:39.400
WE HAVE OUR HUSBANDS,
WIVES, CHILDREN,

15:39.433 --> 15:43.167
AND ALL THE EXTENDED RELATIVES
OF THAT FAMILY.

15:43.200 --> 15:45.900
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER BOND,

15:45.933 --> 15:50.067
AND THAT IS
THE BOND OF FRIENDSHIP.

15:50.067 --> 15:52.733
THINK OF ALL THAT IT IMPLIES.

15:52.767 --> 15:54.800
THE CARING, THE COMPASSION,

15:54.833 --> 15:56.733
THE DEVOTION TO LOYALTY,

15:56.767 --> 15:58.533
AND ABOVE ALL, PERHAPS,

15:58.567 --> 16:02.267
TO THE GENEROSITY OF SPIRIT.

16:02.300 --> 16:05.600
WE MUST ALL ASK OURSELVES,

16:05.633 --> 16:09.067
AM I A GOOD FRIEND?

16:09.067 --> 16:12.500
AM I GIVINGTHE FRIEND IN NEED

16:12.533 --> 16:15.733
WHAT HE NEEDS MOST?

16:15.767 --> 16:18.600
HAVE I SACRIFICED
MY OWN WELL-BEING

16:18.633 --> 16:20.200
FOR THE SAKE OF HIM,

16:20.233 --> 16:22.533
OR HAVE I LET
MY OWN SELFISH NEEDS

16:22.567 --> 16:25.933
STAND IN THE WAY
OF BEING HIS BEST FRIEND.

16:25.967 --> 16:27.767
MY FRIENDS...

16:27.800 --> 16:30.833
- MOM, DAD.
- ...GIVE WHENEVER
THE OPPORTUNITY ARISES...

16:32.967 --> 16:34.567
I HAVE TO GO.

16:34.600 --> 16:37.800
...AND TASTE THE JOY
THAT IS GOD'S REWARD.

16:39.933 --> 16:42.667
Stewardess:
PLEASE NOTICE THIS AIRCRAFT
HAS THREE EMERGENCY EXITS

16:42.700 --> 16:44.800
LOCATED IN THE REAR,
CENTER AND FORWARD SECTIONS
OF THE CABIN.

16:44.833 --> 16:46.800
PASSENGERS SEATED
IN THESE EXIT ROWS

16:46.833 --> 16:49.200
AGREE TO ASSIST
IN THE EVENT OF EMERGENCY.

16:49.233 --> 16:51.367
IF FOR ANY REASON A PASSENGER
SEATED IN THE EXIT ROW...

16:51.400 --> 16:53.800
- WELL, HELLO AGAIN.
- OH, HI THERE.

16:53.833 --> 16:56.300
HI. I'LL GO AHEAD AND GET
YOU ANOTHER AT, OKAY?

16:56.333 --> 16:58.400
OH, WON'T HEAR OF IT.

16:58.433 --> 17:01.267
YOU CAN DEPEND ON ME, MA'AM.
I WON'T LET YOU DOWN.

17:01.300 --> 17:02.933
( clicks tongue )

17:02.967 --> 17:05.067
- I GOT IT COVERED.
- REALLY?

17:05.067 --> 17:08.133
OH AND, UH, BE A DEAR,
WOULD YOU AND GET ME
A GIN AND TONIC.

17:08.167 --> 17:09.767
SURE.

17:13.800 --> 17:23.833
NICE DAY FOR FLIGHT.

17:23.833 --> 17:32.667
NICE DAY FOR FLIGHT.

17:32.700 --> 17:34.400
YOU CAN HAVE MY KIDNEY.

17:34.433 --> 17:36.800
OH, I LOVE YOU MAN.

17:36.833 --> 17:38.600
I KNEW YOU'D COME THROUGH.
YOU'RE A HERO.

17:38.633 --> 17:40.633
IT'S OKAY BUDDY.
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

17:40.667 --> 17:44.533
OH, I HOPE SO.
THANK YOU MAN.
OH GOD.

17:44.567 --> 17:46.233
- HEY?
- HUH?

17:46.267 --> 17:49.067
- WHAT'S THAT?
- WHAT'S THAT WHAT?

17:49.100 --> 17:52.733
- WHAT'S THIS PUTTER?
- LARRY, THANK YOU.

17:52.767 --> 17:54.167
HAVE YOU ALWAYS HAD THIS?

17:54.200 --> 17:56.067
YEAH, I'VE HAD THESE
FOR AWHILE, YOU KNOW.

17:56.067 --> 17:58.367
I BORROWED THIS
FROM MY FRIEND
A FEW WEEKS AGO

17:58.400 --> 18:00.767
AND I PLAYED
OUT OF MY MIND WITH IT.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.367
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR THIS.

18:02.400 --> 18:03.567
YOU CAN'T EVEN
GET THEM ANYMORE.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.900
MY GOD, I LOVE
THIS PUTTER.

18:05.933 --> 18:07.200
YEAH, I KNOW,
IT'S PRETTY GREAT.

18:07.233 --> 18:10.600
UM, WOULD IT BE OKAY IF I
BORROWED THIS FOR A WHILE?

18:10.633 --> 18:14.100
MMM, I DON'T THINK SO.

18:14.133 --> 18:16.133
WHAT?

18:16.167 --> 18:18.967
I'VE LOST A LOT OF CLUBS.
I'VE LENT THEM OUT
THROUGH THE YEARS--

18:19.067 --> 18:21.600
I'M NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING.
I'LL TAKE REALLY GOOD CARE
OF IT, BELIEVE ME.

18:21.633 --> 18:24.067
- I CAN'T LEND
THEM OUT ANYMORE.
- I DON'T GET THAT.

18:24.067 --> 18:26.300
COME ON, I'LL TAKE GOOD
CARE OF IT, I PROMISE.

18:26.333 --> 18:28.933
NO, I'M SURE YOU WILL.
BUT I-- I PREFER YOU DIDN'T.

18:28.967 --> 18:31.300
I'M-- I'M ABOUT...

18:33.867 --> 18:37.067
WHAT?

18:37.100 --> 18:39.867
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.
I-- I--

18:39.900 --> 18:43.167
- I RESPECT YOUR DECISIONS.
- REALLY?

18:43.200 --> 18:45.333
I STILL LOVE YOU.

18:46.733 --> 18:48.767
GOD BLESS YOU.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.600
JESUS CHRIST.

18:57.100 --> 18:59.867
- ( door closes )
- CHERYL?

18:59.900 --> 19:03.367
- Cheryl: YEAH?
- I'M HOME.

19:03.400 --> 19:06.833
HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

19:09.100 --> 19:10.767
OH MY GOD.

19:10.800 --> 19:13.267
WHAT?

19:14.700 --> 19:16.600
I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU.

19:16.633 --> 19:19.300
MMM, I LOVE YOU
SO MUCH.

19:19.333 --> 19:22.133
- I LOVE YOU.
- OKAY.

19:22.167 --> 19:24.600
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

19:24.633 --> 19:26.867
IS THIS A SWEATER VEST?

19:29.200 --> 19:32.333
- I'VE BEEN DOING
A LOT OF THINKING.
- HM-MM.

19:32.367 --> 19:35.100
I WANT TO HAVE CHILDREN.

19:35.133 --> 19:37.100
LOTS OF THEM.

19:40.167 --> 19:41.800
WELL, LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.

19:41.833 --> 19:45.500
WE-- WE, UH,
THAT DESERVES
A DISCUSSION, I THINK.

19:45.533 --> 19:47.433
WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT
TONIGHT OVER DINNER.

19:47.467 --> 19:48.767
OKAY.

19:48.800 --> 19:50.867
AND THEN I'LL TELL YOU
ALL ABOUT THEM.

19:50.900 --> 19:53.500
YEAH, MAYBE YOU COULD, UH...

19:53.533 --> 19:56.533
YOU KNOW, TAKE YOUR TIE OFF.

19:59.100 --> 20:01.333
I KNOW WHY GOD

20:01.367 --> 20:04.167
SAVED ME FROM DROWNING
A FEW MONTHS AGO.

20:04.200 --> 20:06.900
WHY?

20:06.933 --> 20:09.167
HE WANTED ME
TO GIVE LEWIS MY KIDNEY.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.867
AND I'M GOING TO.

20:19.367 --> 20:22.400
GOTTA SAY, MAN,

20:22.433 --> 20:25.300
YOU ARE VERY,
VERY CALM, BRO.

20:25.333 --> 20:27.767
GOD WILL WATCH OVER ME.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.167
HMM. HE DIDN'T
WATCH OVER THE LAST GUY.

20:30.200 --> 20:33.333
BUT YOU'RE A LUCKY MAN.

20:33.367 --> 20:35.333
YOU'RE GIVING
AWAY A KIDNEY.

20:35.367 --> 20:38.300
THE RECIPIENT IS
GOING TO LOVE YOU, MAN.

20:38.333 --> 20:40.933
- REALLY?
- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
YOUR OWN PERSONAL SLAVE,

20:40.967 --> 20:42.533
IS WHAT IT IS.
YOU COULD BE IN CHINA

20:42.567 --> 20:44.967
AND SNEEZE AND HE'LL
BRING YOU A TISSUE.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.267
WELL, THAT MAY BE
TRUE OF OTHERS.

20:47.300 --> 20:49.233
I DON'T THINK
WITH HIM, THOUGH.

20:49.267 --> 20:52.333
HE WOULDN'T EVEN LOAN ME
A PUTTER, ACTUALLY.

20:52.367 --> 20:55.267
YOU'RE GIVING HIM A KIDNEY,
HE WOULDN'T LOAN YOU
HIS PUTTER?

20:55.300 --> 20:57.667
WELL, YOU KNOW
PEOPLE GET VERY ATTACHED
TO THEIR GOLF CLUBS.

20:57.700 --> 21:01.067
- IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.
- YOU'RE NOT ATTACHED
TO YOUR KIDNEY?

21:03.533 --> 21:06.067
THAT'S FUCKED UP, MAN.

21:32.100 --> 21:36.200
LARRY, I GOTTA TELL YA,
I'M TOO WEAK TO REALLY EXPRESS
IT AND ARTICULATE IT,

21:36.233 --> 21:38.833
BUT THIS IS
THE GREATEST THING THAT
ANYONE'S EVER DONE FOR ME.

21:38.867 --> 21:41.233
I'LL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

21:41.267 --> 21:44.233
JUST ASK ME ANYTHING
AND I'LL DO IT FOR YOU,
I PROMISE.

21:44.267 --> 21:47.067
( laughs )
ANYTHING EXCEPT
LOAN HIM YOUR PUTTER.

21:47.100 --> 21:50.467
YOU TOLD HIM
ABOUT THE PUTTER?

21:50.500 --> 21:53.867
NO, IT IT WAS AN INNOCENT
CONVERSATION.

21:53.900 --> 21:56.600
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN BRING IT
UP UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES?

21:56.633 --> 21:58.833
- I ACTUALLY DEFENDED YOU.
- Jones: MR. DAVID.

21:58.867 --> 22:01.500
- DEFEND ME? WHY DON'T YOU
CALL E.T. OR PAT O'BRIEN?
- MR. DAVID!

22:01.533 --> 22:05.300
I MEAN, HOW DARE YOU?
WHAT, YOU HAVE TO GOSSIP?
WHAT KIND OF PERSON ARE YOU?

22:05.333 --> 22:08.167
- THERE'S BEEN A BIG,
BIG MISTAKE, OKAY?
- HUH?

22:08.200 --> 22:12.500
THE CONES,
THEY'RE NOT YOUR PARENTS.
YOU'RE NOT ADOPTED.

22:12.533 --> 22:15.067
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- YOU'RE NOT ADOPTED.

22:15.067 --> 22:17.767
- I'M NOT ADOPTED?
- NO. SORRY.

22:17.800 --> 22:19.767
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I'M NOT ADOPTED?

22:19.800 --> 22:22.600
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
- IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,
JUST LET ME KNOW, OKAY?

22:22.633 --> 22:24.767
- ARE YOU SURE?
- YEAH, I AM.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.767
GOOD LUCK
WITH THE SURGERY.

22:30.700 --> 22:32.667
( screams )
I CAN'T--

22:32.700 --> 22:36.200
I CAN'T DO THIS.
OH, NO NO! I'M NOT ADOPTED.

22:36.233 --> 22:38.400
GET ME OUT OF HERE!
GET ME THE FUCK
OUT OF HERE!

22:38.433 --> 22:40.933
- WHO IS THAT GUY?
- I CAN'T DO THIS!

22:40.967 --> 22:44.233
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU-- STOP IT!
- WHAT ABOUT MY KIDNEY?

22:44.267 --> 22:46.367
I GOT-- I DON'T--
I CAN'T DIE.

22:46.400 --> 22:49.900
Lewis:
HEY, STAY HERE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

22:49.933 --> 22:52.067
( screams )

22:58.333 --> 23:01.067
YOU'RE THE BEST.
YOU'RE THE BEST.

23:04.967 --> 23:06.967
HEY. LET'S GO.

23:10.767 --> 23:12.733
( beeping )

23:23.400 --> 23:25.233
( weakly )
YOU REALLY LOW-BALLED ME
ON THAT CAR.

23:28.867 --> 23:31.367
YOU PAID ME $5,000 LESS

23:31.400 --> 23:33.833
THEN THE BLUE BOOK.

23:33.867 --> 23:37.733
I LOOKED IN THE WRONG BOOK,
I GUESS, UM.

23:37.767 --> 23:41.567
I WANT YOU TO GIVE
THE $5,000 TO CHER--
TO CHERYL.

23:41.600 --> 23:44.067
I'LL GIVE
THE $5,000 TO CHERYL.

23:44.067 --> 23:46.167
OKAY.
( coughs )

23:57.500 --> 24:01.267
SEE?
THIS IS WHAT YOU GET

24:01.300 --> 24:03.967
FROM DOING GOOD DEEDS.

24:04.067 --> 24:06.233
I AVOIDED GOOD DEEDS
MY WHOLE LIFE.

24:06.267 --> 24:09.333
TURNS OUT I WAS RIGHT.
( coughs )

24:09.367 --> 24:11.833
YOU'RE RIGHT.
LARRY, THE RABBI IS HERE.

24:11.867 --> 24:13.667
THE RABBI.

24:14.900 --> 24:17.767
RABBI.

24:17.800 --> 24:21.500
LARRY, WHAT CAN I SAY?

24:21.533 --> 24:23.367
I'M STILL YOUNG, RABBI.

24:23.400 --> 24:25.633
I THOUGHT WHEN GOD
TAKES SOMEONE YOUNG,

24:25.667 --> 24:28.600
THEY'RE USUALLY
A GOOD PERSON.

24:28.633 --> 24:31.200
THAT'S THE ONE THING
I HAD GOING FOR ME.

24:31.233 --> 24:33.200
WELL GOD IS--
IS APPARENTLY

24:33.233 --> 24:35.967
MAKING AN EXCEPTION
IN YOUR CASE.

24:38.600 --> 24:40.567
LARRY, IS YOUR HOUSE
IN ORDER?

24:40.600 --> 24:43.167
I MEAN YOU SHOULD HAVE
EVERYTHING SETTLED BY NOW.

24:43.200 --> 24:44.933
MY BUSINESS MANAGER, MATT.

24:44.967 --> 24:47.933
- I-- I WORKED
THINGS OUT WITH HIM.
- GOOD, GOOD.

24:50.167 --> 24:52.500
I SUPPOSED I COULD
HAVE TRAVELED MORE.

24:52.533 --> 24:55.767
- YEAH.
- BUT WHERE WAS I GONNA GO?

24:55.800 --> 24:58.467
I WENT TO EUROPE ONCE.

24:58.500 --> 25:01.767
NO BIG DEAL.

25:01.800 --> 25:04.067
THE TRUTH IS, RABBI,

25:04.067 --> 25:07.633
I CAN'T STAND PACKING.

25:07.667 --> 25:10.067
YOU KNOW, LARRY,

25:10.067 --> 25:12.267
WE ALL HAVE MOMENTS
IN OUR LIFE WHEN

25:12.300 --> 25:15.700
WE'VE ACTED
OUT OF THOUGHTLESSNESS

25:15.733 --> 25:19.067
AND WE'VE BEEN INCONSIDERATE
TO OTHER PEOPLE.

25:19.067 --> 25:21.700
IS THERE ANYBODY, RIGHT NOW,

25:21.733 --> 25:25.067
THAT YOU CAN THINK OF
YOU'D LIKE TO ASK
FOR FORGIVENESS

25:25.100 --> 25:28.867
AND MAKE RIGHT WITH?

25:28.900 --> 25:31.433
WHEN YOU WALK THROUGH MY DOOR,
YOU PLAY BY MY RULES.

25:31.467 --> 25:33.400
YOU TAKE OFF
YOUR FUCKING SHOES!

25:33.433 --> 25:35.833
DEVOTED SISTER?
BELOVED CUNT?

25:35.867 --> 25:37.667
HE'S A RACIST.
A BONA FIDE RACIST

25:37.700 --> 25:40.933
WHO PREFERRED NOT
TO WORK WITH ANY BLACK PEOPLE
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

25:40.967 --> 25:44.400
- YOU FUCKED UP.
- LARRY, YOU ATE THE BABY
JESUS AND HIS MOTHER MARY.

25:44.433 --> 25:46.333
- YOU WERE FOLLOWING MY WIFE?!
- I WASN'T FOLLOWING HER!

25:46.367 --> 25:48.867
SHE CALLED THE COPS ON YOU.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO--
LOOK AT ME.

25:48.900 --> 25:51.633
YOU KNEW THAT MY BROTHER-IN-LAW
DIED ON SEPTEMBER 11th.

25:51.667 --> 25:53.467
HOW DARE YOU
SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

25:53.500 --> 25:56.900
SEE, IF THIS WERE YOURS
IT WOULD SAY, "FUCKING
DOUCHE BAG."

25:56.933 --> 25:59.133
You mother-fucking,
cock-sucking

25:59.167 --> 26:00.967
son of a bitch bastard!

26:01.067 --> 26:02.567
I WILL BODY-SLAM
YOU SO HARD,

26:02.600 --> 26:04.833
THAT YOU WILL POOP
YOUR BALD PANTS.

26:04.867 --> 26:06.800
YOU NEED A GOOD FUCKING
ASS KICKING.

26:06.833 --> 26:09.767
THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED.
YOU WANT TO NAME
OUR BABY TANG?

26:09.800 --> 26:12.633
HEY! HOLD THE DOOR!

26:20.367 --> 26:22.167
NO, THIS IS
MY JACKET!

26:22.200 --> 26:25.333
( slams piano )
( fist thuds )

26:25.367 --> 26:27.800
WHAT ARE YOU, CRAZY?

26:27.833 --> 26:29.967
- STOP IT!
- MY NECK! MY NECK!

26:33.533 --> 26:35.967
- DON'T PUSH ME AGAIN,
YOU STUPID--
- Cheryl: LARRY!

26:36.067 --> 26:38.900
- GET HIM, JOSEPH!
- TAKE IT BACK!
THIS IS OURS.

26:38.933 --> 26:41.733
- Woman: KILL HIM,
JOSEPH. KILL HIM!
- SHUT UP, MARY.

26:41.767 --> 26:44.200
OW!

26:44.233 --> 26:46.667
- YOU'RE A DISGRACE
TO YOUR PEOPLE.
- ( silent )

26:46.700 --> 26:49.300
- FUCK YOU.
- MOTHERFUCKER,
WHAT THE FUCK?

26:49.333 --> 26:51.800
LARRY, YOU PIECE OF SHIT.

26:51.833 --> 26:54.333
- YOU BE QUIET, BIG NOSE.
- GO FUCK YOURSELF.

26:54.367 --> 26:55.800
- FREAK YOU.
- FREAK YOU!

26:55.833 --> 26:57.600
- ASSHOLE.
- THANKS FOR NOTHING.

26:57.633 --> 26:59.367
GET OUT RIGHT NOW!

27:01.733 --> 27:05.300
- GOOD BOY!
- BANZAI!

27:10.267 --> 27:12.633
NAH.

27:15.867 --> 27:18.367
JEFF.

27:22.767 --> 27:26.233
YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER
SAID ANYTHING,

27:26.267 --> 27:28.333
BUT I'VE NOTICED,

27:28.367 --> 27:30.867
YOU USE WAY TOO MUCH MAYO.

27:30.900 --> 27:33.500
YOU KNOW,
WHEN THEY MAKE TUNA,

27:33.533 --> 27:36.200
THERE'S ALREADY
MAYO IN IT.

27:36.233 --> 27:38.667
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT
IT ON THE BREAD.

27:41.300 --> 27:43.633
I'LL USE LESS MAYO,
I PROMISE.

27:43.667 --> 27:47.233
ALSO...

27:47.267 --> 27:49.167
YOU REALLY NEVER
SHOULD HAVE LET ME DO

27:49.200 --> 27:52.133
THAT SEINFELD
"TV GUIDE" COVER.

27:52.167 --> 27:54.167
I REALLY LOOKED
LIKE AN ASSHOLE.

27:54.200 --> 27:56.500
MY MISTAKE.
I'M SO SORRY.

27:56.533 --> 27:58.067
- ANYTHING ELSE?
- NO.

27:58.100 --> 27:59.800
OKAY.

28:02.633 --> 28:04.533
DAD.

28:08.533 --> 28:12.133
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE ADOPTION.

28:12.167 --> 28:14.067
YOU'RE-- YOU'RE WHAT?

28:14.067 --> 28:16.667
THE ADOP-- THE ADOPTION.

28:16.700 --> 28:18.133
THE DOC-- THE DOCTOR?

28:18.167 --> 28:20.233
( sighs )

28:20.267 --> 28:22.833
ADOP-- ADOPTION.

28:22.867 --> 28:26.700
YOU WANT A DOCTOR?
A DOCTOR?

28:26.733 --> 28:29.067
- MR. DAVID--
- HE-- HE WANTS--
I GUESS HE WANTS A DOCTOR.

28:29.100 --> 28:31.800
YEAH, WHY DON'T YOU STEP--
STEP RIGHT BACK HERE.

28:31.833 --> 28:35.200
- LAR.
- ( groans )

28:38.600 --> 28:40.667
CHERYL.

28:43.933 --> 28:46.233
I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE...

28:46.267 --> 28:49.967
A LONG TIME TILL
I SEE YOU AGAIN,

28:50.067 --> 28:52.600
SO WOULD IT BE
OKAY IF...

28:52.633 --> 28:56.233
I FOOLED AROUND A LITTLE

28:56.267 --> 28:58.833
UNTIL YOU GOT THERE?

28:58.867 --> 29:00.967
SURE.

29:02.067 --> 29:03.867
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE?

29:06.067 --> 29:08.967
I KNOW IT WAS YOU

29:09.067 --> 29:12.067
WHO MISPLACED THAT
"SOPRANOS" DVD COVER.

29:13.867 --> 29:17.167
IT COULDN'T
HAVE BEEN ME.

29:17.200 --> 29:19.267
I HAVE A SYSTEM.

29:21.333 --> 29:24.267
( panting )
I... I HAVE A...

29:24.300 --> 29:26.300
I HAVE A SYSTEM.

29:29.867 --> 29:31.600
( machine flatlines )

29:31.633 --> 29:41.667
LARRY?

29:41.667 --> 29:49.833
LARRY?

30:09.167 --> 30:12.333
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU CAN TELL ME

30:12.367 --> 30:14.100
ABOUT HIS WILL?

30:14.133 --> 30:17.767
I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S--
IT'S AWKWARD TIMING

30:17.800 --> 30:20.500
BUT HE WAS VERY
SECRETIVE

30:20.533 --> 30:24.233
- FOR A WHILE THERE
AT THE END AND I JUST--
- UH, CHERYL...

30:24.267 --> 30:27.367
THIS 5,000--
YOU WANT THE $5,000?

30:27.400 --> 30:30.900
- OF COURSE.
- CHERYL, THAT'S UNREASONABLE.
IT REALLY IS.

30:30.933 --> 30:33.933
HE MANIPULATED JEFF.
JEFF HAD NO CHOICE BUT
TO SAY "YES".

30:33.967 --> 30:37.200
- I JUST HEARD HIM SAY IT WAS
THE BLUE BOOK VALUE ON IT.
- IT'S A PETTY WISH.

30:37.233 --> 30:40.067
- YOU DON'T NEED THE MONEY.
- HE'S PETTY IN LIFE,
HE'S PETTY IN DEATH.

30:40.100 --> 30:43.033
- THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
- CHERYL, YOU HAVE
A LOT OF MONEY.

30:43.067 --> 30:47.033
Jeff:
IT WAS A--
NO, NO, CHERYL.

30:47.067 --> 30:49.033
( all bickering )

30:49.067 --> 30:51.300
HE DID NOT RIP HIM OFF.

30:51.333 --> 31:01.433
( bickering continues )

31:01.433 --> 31:11.433
( bickering continues )

31:45.267 --> 31:47.333
HELLO.

31:51.200 --> 31:54.200
WE'RE YOUR GUIDES.

31:54.233 --> 31:58.900
WE'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU
YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

31:58.933 --> 32:01.067
PLEASE.

32:03.900 --> 32:08.200
- YOU'RE MY GUIDES?
- YEAH, BUT YOU ARE DEAD.

32:08.233 --> 32:10.800
YOU DID DIE.

32:14.567 --> 32:17.167
- YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT
A LOT OF FANS UP HERE.
- REALLY?

32:17.200 --> 32:20.467
- YOU'VE HEARD OF PONCE DE LEON?
- YEAH, THE SPANISH EXPLORER.

32:20.500 --> 32:21.867
- YEAH.
- I WROTE A SCREENPLAY
ABOUT HIM.

32:21.900 --> 32:24.633
- HE KNOWS THAT.
HE LOVES IT.
- GET OUTTA HERE.

32:24.667 --> 32:28.667
LARRY, MARILYN MONROE
WAS A HUGE FAN OF
THE SEINFELD SHOW.

32:28.700 --> 32:30.233
- WHAT?
- IT'S TRUE.

32:30.267 --> 32:31.367
- YOU'RE KIDDING.
- NO.

32:31.400 --> 32:33.367
SHE'S VERY MUCH LOOKING
FORWARD TO MEETING YOU.

32:33.400 --> 32:35.933
- GET OUT.
- SHE TALKS OFTEN OF YOU.

32:35.967 --> 32:38.533
MARILYN MONROE?

32:38.567 --> 32:40.667
- IT'S TRUE, ISN'T IT?
- THE TRUTH.

32:42.700 --> 32:44.800
IT'S YOUR MOTHER, LARRY.

32:44.833 --> 32:46.967
SAY HELLO
TO YOUR MOTHER.

32:50.433 --> 32:52.633
WHAT KIND
OF SCHMUCK ARE YOU?!

32:52.667 --> 32:54.067
I MEAN, WHO GOES AROUND

32:54.067 --> 32:55.967
GIVING THEIR KIDNEY
TO PEOPLE?

32:56.067 --> 32:58.767
IDIOT! AND I'M SURPRISED
THAT YOUR FATHER

32:58.800 --> 33:01.400
LET YOU DO SUCH A THING.
WAIT TILL I SEE HIM AGAIN.

33:01.433 --> 33:04.333
WHY DID YOU TELL DAD NOT
TO BOTHER ME WHEN YOU DIED?
I MISSED YOUR FUNERAL.

33:04.367 --> 33:06.633
SO WHAT?
WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT?

33:06.667 --> 33:09.267
WHY WERE YOU SO HAPPY
WHEN YOU THOUGHT
YOU WERE ADOPTED?

33:09.300 --> 33:10.600
THAT'S WHAT
I WANNA KNOW.

33:10.633 --> 33:12.200
- I WASN'T HAPPY.
- OH, DON'T GIVE ME THAT.

33:12.233 --> 33:14.367
- YOU WERE VERY HAPPY.
- I WAS NOT HAPPY.

33:14.400 --> 33:16.467
- YOU WERE ABSOLUTELY GIDDY.
- NO, I WAS NOT GIDDY.

33:16.500 --> 33:19.900
- GIDDY? I WAS NOT GIDDY.
- YOU WERE GIDDY.

33:19.933 --> 33:22.900
I'M NOT DONE
WITH YOU YET, BUSTER.

33:25.067 --> 33:28.333
HEY, LARRY.
COME HERE.

33:33.067 --> 33:34.867
BEN HOGAN.

33:34.900 --> 33:37.200
YES, SIR.
( chuckles )

33:37.233 --> 33:40.633
- HOW YOU DOING?
- PRETTY GOOD.

33:40.667 --> 33:42.733
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN
WATCHING YOUR GOLF GAME.

33:42.767 --> 33:44.700
- YOU'VE SEEN ME PLAY?
- I HAVE SEEN YOU PLAY.

33:44.733 --> 33:47.400
AND LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING.
YOU'RE MOVING YOUR FEET.

33:47.433 --> 33:49.233
I KNOW, BEN.
I MOVE MY FEET.

33:49.267 --> 33:51.867
YEAH, YOU KNOW
THAT SEX OFFENDER HAD
A GOOD TIP FOR YOU.

33:51.900 --> 33:54.133
- I KNOW. DROPPING THE CLUB.
- DROPPING YOUR--

33:54.167 --> 33:56.300
I CAN'T DO IT, BEN.
I CAN'T. I'VE TRIED.

33:56.333 --> 33:57.867
WHY DON'T YOU
COME OUT WITH ME?
WE'LL SHOOT 18.

33:57.900 --> 34:00.533
I'LL SHOW YOU
HOW IT'S DONE, HUH?

34:00.567 --> 34:02.500
- THERE'S GOLF HERE?
- ABSOLUTELY.

34:02.533 --> 34:05.367
WE GOT GREAT
COURSES UP HERE.

34:05.400 --> 34:08.267
- YOU GOT A DATE.
- I'LL BE WAITIN' FOR YOU.

34:12.300 --> 34:14.067
I'M PLAYING GOLF
WITH BEN HOGAN.

34:14.100 --> 34:17.067
IT'S CALLED HEAVEN.
COME ON.

34:17.100 --> 34:19.700
- YOU GUYS, YOU'VE BEEN
AROUND ME MY WHOLE LIFE?
- OH YEAH.

34:19.733 --> 34:22.767
YOU WERE AT THE SPIN-
THE-BOTTLE PARTY WHEN I RAN
OUT WHEN I WAS 12

34:22.800 --> 34:24.067
- 'CAUSE I WAS--
- WE WERE THERE.

34:24.067 --> 34:25.867
YES, I ALWAYS WANTED
TO ASK YOU ABOUT THAT.

34:25.900 --> 34:28.433
- WHY WERE YOU SO HUMILIATED?
- I FELT SO HUMILIATED.

34:28.467 --> 34:31.133
- YOU SHOULD'VE STAYED.
- 'CAUSE I COULDN'T
KISS ANYBODY.

34:31.167 --> 34:32.900
- I WAS SCARED.
- NANCY LOVED YOU THEN.

34:32.933 --> 34:34.700
- LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.
- OKAY.

34:34.733 --> 34:37.900
DID YOU HEAR MY WIFE
TELLING ME THAT I COULD--
SHE SAID I COULD FOOL AROUND?

34:37.933 --> 34:40.233
- YES, WE HEARD.
- YOU HEARD HER SAY
THAT, RIGHT?

34:40.267 --> 34:43.133
ALL RIGHT, SO,
IF YOU GO ON A DATE,
WHERE DO YOU GO?

34:43.167 --> 34:44.833
ARE THERE RESTAURANTS?
ARE THERE MOVIES?

34:44.867 --> 34:48.100
LIKE, HOW DOES THAT WORK?
WHAT DO YOU DO HERE ALL DAY?

34:48.133 --> 34:50.233
- LARRY, LARRY...
- AND WHAT ABOUT
THIS CLOTHING?

34:50.267 --> 34:53.700
- I NEED SOCKS AND UNDERWEAR.
- YOU'LL LEARN ALL THAT
IN DUE TIME.

34:53.733 --> 34:55.833
- JUST BE PATIENT.
- I'M JUST ASKING A QUESTION.
THAT'S ALL.

34:55.867 --> 34:59.833
- WE UNDERSTAND THAT.
- SO, IF YOU'RE MY GUIDES,

34:59.867 --> 35:03.067
THEN HOW COME YOU LET ME
EAT THOSE SEVEN PIECES
OF PIZZA AT CAMP?

35:03.067 --> 35:05.833
- REMEMBER, I GOT SICK
AND HAD TO GO HOME?
- WE REMEMBER EVERYTHING.

35:05.867 --> 35:07.533
YEAH, LARRY, LISTEN.

35:07.567 --> 35:09.333
WE'RE YOUR GUIDES.

35:09.367 --> 35:12.067
WE CAN'T ACTUALLY
CONTROL EVENTS.

35:12.067 --> 35:14.167
WHEN THEN, WHAT'S THE POINT
OF THE WHOLE THING?

35:14.200 --> 35:17.167
I MEAN, WHO--
WHY DO I EVEN NEED YOU?
WHAT DOES A GUIDE DO?

35:17.200 --> 35:19.167
I DON'T EVEN GET IT.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.400
AND WHAT ABOUT GOING
TO THE BATHROOM?

35:21.433 --> 35:23.200
BECAUSE, I NOTICE
I'VE BEEN HERE A WHILE

35:23.233 --> 35:25.300
AND FRANKLY I DON'T
HAVE TO DO ANYTHING.

35:25.333 --> 35:27.867
AND IF THAT'S THE CASE...
( whistles )

35:27.900 --> 35:31.133
THAT'S GONNA BE PRETTY GOOD.
PRETTY GOOD.

35:31.167 --> 35:34.467
- OH, ONE MORE THING.
- YES, WHAT IS IT?

35:34.500 --> 35:36.600
- "THE SOPRANOS" DVD COVER...
- THE COVER.

35:36.633 --> 35:38.367
ANY IDEA?

35:38.400 --> 35:40.600
DID YOU LOOK BEHIND
THE COUCH, LARRY?

35:40.633 --> 35:42.233
- BEHIND THE COUCH?
- IT'S BEHIND THE COUCH.

35:42.267 --> 35:44.600
DID YOU ONCE LOOK
BEHIND THE COUCH, LARRY?

35:44.633 --> 35:46.833
- YOU DIDN'T, DID YOU?
- WELL, I DIDN'T REALLY
LOOK FOR IT.

35:46.867 --> 35:48.600
BECAUSE YOU
HAD A SYSTEM.

35:48.633 --> 35:52.167
THAT'S RIGHT.
I HAVE A SYSTEM
I TAKE THE DVD--

35:52.200 --> 35:55.300
COVER AND PUT IT
ON TOP OF THE DVD PLAYER.

35:55.333 --> 35:58.400
- RIGHT, EXACTLY.
- THAT'S NOT A SYSTEM.

35:58.433 --> 36:00.667
- OH, IS THAT SO?
- A SYSTEM IS--

36:00.700 --> 36:03.067
IS THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE
GONNA MISPLACE THE DVD

36:03.067 --> 36:05.567
SO YOU GET SOME
DVD JACKETS,

36:05.600 --> 36:07.600
JUST PLAIN ONES,
AND YOU HAVE THEM THERE

36:07.633 --> 36:10.167
IN CASE YOU LOSE A--
THAT'S A SYSTEM.

36:10.200 --> 36:11.833
- THAT'S NOT A SYSTEM.
- KEEP THE JACKETS IN A FOLDER.
IT'S A SYSTEM.

36:11.867 --> 36:15.567
PEOPLE MISPLACE DVD's
BECAUSE THEY TAKE THE COVER
AND PUT IT SOMEPLACE ELSE.

36:15.600 --> 36:18.067
AND THE PEOPLE
THAT MISPLACE THE DVD'S

36:18.067 --> 36:20.800
- HAVE EXTRA DVD JACKETS.
- WHOA, OKAY.

36:20.833 --> 36:22.500
- THAT'S A SYSTEM.
- NO, THAT'S NOT A SYSTEM.

36:22.533 --> 36:24.800
- LISTEN TO YOUR GUIDE.
- A LITTLE BIT OF RESPECT.

36:24.833 --> 36:28.300
OH, MR. GREAT GUIDE
WHO LET ME DO THAT
"TV GUIDE" COVER.

36:28.333 --> 36:30.067
- FUCK YOU.
- FUCK YOU.

36:30.067 --> 36:32.167
- FUCK YOU. FUCK YOU!
- FUCK YOU.

36:32.200 --> 36:35.100
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, OKAY.
TAKE IT EASY. JUST COME
OVER HERE AND RELAX.

36:35.133 --> 36:37.267
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, RELAX?
- OKAY, COME ON.

36:37.300 --> 36:47.333
( guides whispering )

36:47.333 --> 36:55.667
( guides whispering )

36:58.267 --> 37:00.867
LARRY, UM...

37:00.900 --> 37:03.100
WE'VE DECIDED THAT
YOU'RE NOT REALLY READY

37:03.133 --> 37:06.433
AND WE'RE GONNA SEND YOU
BACK INTO YOUR BODY.

37:06.467 --> 37:08.500
- WHAT?
- WE'RE SENDING YOU BACK.

37:08.533 --> 37:11.233
WHAT, BECAUSE I SAID
SOMETHING ABOUT THE SYSTEM?

37:11.267 --> 37:13.633
YOU'RE JUST NOT READY.

37:13.667 --> 37:16.567
OKAY, MAYBE
IT ISN'T MUCH OF A SYSTEM.
YOU'RE RIGHT, IT'S NOT.

37:16.600 --> 37:19.100
IT'S A BAD SYSTEM.
IT'S NOT A GOOD SYSTEM.

37:19.133 --> 37:20.767
- GOODBYE, LARRY.
- WE'RE SORRY.

37:20.800 --> 37:22.267
COME ON.
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

37:22.300 --> 37:24.867
- GOODBYE, LARRY.
- GOODBYE, LARRY.

37:24.900 --> 37:27.400
GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE.

37:27.433 --> 37:29.733
WAIT WAIT,
I LIKE IT HERE.

37:29.767 --> 37:33.300
- WHERE YOU GOIN', LARRY?
- MARILYN.

37:33.333 --> 37:36.567
I WAS SO LOOKING
FORWARD TO MEETING YOU.

37:36.600 --> 37:39.200
I REALLY LOVE
YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR.
( giggles )

37:39.233 --> 37:41.433
- MARILYN!
- DON'T GO, LARRY.

37:41.467 --> 37:44.800
- MARYLYN!
- DON'T GO.

37:47.933 --> 37:49.867
I'M NOT PAYING.
I'M NOT PAYING.

37:49.900 --> 37:52.133
- LOOK, I'M NOT
PAYING IT. I'M NOT.
- ( machine beeps )

37:52.167 --> 37:53.567
- WHAT?
- OH MY GOD.

37:53.600 --> 37:55.900
- LARRY?
- Jeff: MY GOD.

38:00.933 --> 38:02.500
JESUS.

38:04.067 --> 38:06.233
OH MY GOD.

38:13.400 --> 38:15.367
( groans )

38:16.500 --> 38:18.500
( sighs )

38:22.167 --> 38:24.300
YOU NOTICE
HOW IN THE MOVIES

38:24.333 --> 38:26.533
THEY NEVER FOLD
WHEN THEY'RE PACKING?

38:26.567 --> 38:28.833
THEY JUST THROW
EVERYTHING IN.

38:28.867 --> 38:31.067
- HM-MM.
- IT'S NOT BELIEVABLE.

38:31.067 --> 38:34.500
- YOU KNOW?
- IT'S NOT INTERESTING
TO WATCH, REALLY.

38:34.533 --> 38:37.867
WELL, STILL, YOU HAVE
TO PACK THE RIGHT WAY.

38:37.900 --> 38:40.200
PEOPLE JUST DON'T
CRUMPLE UP THEIR CLOTHES

38:40.233 --> 38:42.067
AND THROW THEM IN A SUITCASE.
THAT'S NOT REAL.

38:42.067 --> 38:43.667
I'M NOT BUYING THAT.

38:43.700 --> 38:45.967
YOU LOOK GOOD.
YOU DO.

38:46.067 --> 38:49.700
- REALLY?
- YEAH, YOU LOOK GOOD,
YOU KNOW?

38:49.733 --> 38:52.900
YOU KNOW, I GOTTA
TALK TO THE DOCTOR.

38:52.933 --> 38:56.067
SEE IF I GOT SOME CLEARANCE,
SOME SEX CLEARANCE.

38:56.067 --> 38:58.600
DO YOU HAVE TO GET
CLEARANCE FOR THAT?

38:58.633 --> 39:00.333
I THINK YOU DO.

39:00.367 --> 39:03.433
NEEDLESS TO SAY,
I'M QUITE PREPARED.

39:03.467 --> 39:05.500
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

39:07.100 --> 39:09.467
- WHAT A THING, HUH?
- YEAH.

39:09.500 --> 39:11.133
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

39:11.167 --> 39:14.067
YOU FEEL DIFFERENT
AFTER ALL THIS?

39:14.067 --> 39:16.767
YOU KNOW, YEAH.

39:16.800 --> 39:20.067
- I MEAN, COME ON,
I'M A CHANGED MAN.
- I KNOW.

39:20.100 --> 39:22.700
- I'M A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT PERSON.
- THAT'S TRUE.

39:22.733 --> 39:26.500
- YOU REALLY
FEEL LIKE THAT NOW?
- OH, YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.

39:26.533 --> 39:28.767
- I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

39:28.800 --> 39:30.433
- I DON'T NEED
TO SAY IT, RIGHT?
- IT'S GOOD. NO NO.

39:30.467 --> 39:33.800
- OH, HEY.
- HEY. YOUR CHARIOT, SIR.

39:33.833 --> 39:37.067
- WHAT'S THIS?
- HOSPITAL POLICY. YOU GET
TO LEAVE IN A WHEELCHAIR.

39:37.067 --> 39:39.633
HMM, ALL RIGHT.

39:42.667 --> 39:44.600
- LET'S DO IT.
- LET'S DO IT.

39:48.067 --> 39:50.200
VERY EXCITED
ABOUT THIS.

39:51.500 --> 39:52.733
HELLO.

39:52.767 --> 39:54.967
- AND, UH--
- HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

39:55.067 --> 39:57.800
I THINK MAYBE I SHOULD USE
THE BATHROOM BEFORE WE GO.

39:57.833 --> 40:00.867
- OKAY.
- LET'S TRY THE HANDICAPPED.

40:00.900 --> 40:03.400
- LARRY.
- IT'S A RARE OPPORTUNITY,
COME ON.

40:03.433 --> 40:05.900
( sighs )

40:05.933 --> 40:08.200
OH, SOMEONE
MUST BE IN THERE.

40:10.467 --> 40:12.433
- HEY.
- HEY.

40:15.233 --> 40:17.333
WHAT'S WITH
THE WALKING HERE?

40:17.367 --> 40:19.833
I HAD TO USE
THE BATHROOM.

40:19.867 --> 40:21.767
OKAY, I GET IT.

40:21.800 --> 40:24.900
THAT ONE WAS OCCUPIED.
I HAD TO DUCK IN HERE
FOR A SECOND.

40:24.933 --> 40:26.433
IT WAS A BIT
OF AN EMERGENCY.

40:26.467 --> 40:28.633
WELL THEN YOU WAIT.

40:28.667 --> 40:31.367
YOU WAIT.

40:31.400 --> 40:41.433
( theme music playing )

40:41.433 --> 40:51.433
( theme music playing )
