WEBVTT

00:27.402 --> 00:29.696
So, what's<i> le dealio, le Momona?</i>

00:29.779 --> 00:32.532
That's French for, "Mom, why are we here?"

00:32.615 --> 00:34.159
Not even close.

00:34.242 --> 00:39.122
Your father said he has a big surprise,
and for us to meet him in the front yard.

00:39.205 --> 00:41.041
-I'm so excited.

00:41.124 --> 00:43.585
-

00:43.668 --> 00:46.504
Oh, it's a mid-life crisis car.

00:46.588 --> 00:47.547


00:48.089 --> 00:50.800
No. It's a Lipizzan!

00:50.884 --> 00:53.344
I've dreamed of owning one
since I was Johnny's age!

00:53.428 --> 00:56.931
She's perfect, and not a dent anywhere!

00:59.559 --> 01:01.478
It's so cool.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.521
-Can I drive it?
-No, you're 11.

01:03.605 --> 01:05.815
In fact, with your destructive
track record,

01:05.899 --> 01:07.734
you're not even allowed to touch it!

01:07.817 --> 01:09.235
In fact, don't even look at it.

01:09.319 --> 01:11.237
But there's no room in the garage.

01:11.321 --> 01:13.114
That's the best part!

01:13.198 --> 01:17.243
I moved your Pela-cycle outside,
so you can exercise in the fresh air.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.667
Fuel-injected inline six,

01:24.751 --> 01:27.003
and fully independent suspension.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.589
It's exactly what we need.

01:29.672 --> 01:32.801
So, how long is the crisis gonna last?

01:32.884 --> 01:36.429
I'm not having a mid-life crisis.

01:36.513 --> 01:39.182
Now, thanks to the smart watch
the girls made me

01:39.265 --> 01:40.558
for my 40-something birthday,

01:40.642 --> 01:45.730
I'm off to run a 5k
to keep looking young forever.

01:51.945 --> 01:55.198
So, do Moms get mid-life
crisis things too?

01:55.281 --> 01:56.574
In about five years.

01:56.658 --> 01:59.661
But it will be a hot-yoga retreat,
not a "dream car."

01:59.744 --> 02:02.080
And remember what Dad said, Johnny.

02:02.163 --> 02:04.249
No touching, no looking…

02:04.749 --> 02:07.043
And no driving.

02:09.170 --> 02:10.380
So…

02:10.463 --> 02:12.090
what's the plan?

02:13.466 --> 02:16.678
Not looking at Dad's car, check.

02:16.761 --> 02:21.057
And with oven mitts on, you're technically
not "touching" the car. Heh heh.

02:21.141 --> 02:24.769
And since pretend-driving it
is not driving it,

02:24.853 --> 02:26.104
punch it, Dog!

02:30.692 --> 02:33.153
Hold on, we're heading for a cliff!

02:33.236 --> 02:35.280
-What?
-Pretend cliff.

02:35.363 --> 02:36.614
Hit the brakes!

02:36.698 --> 02:38.992
-Too late.

02:39.075 --> 02:40.160
Bail out!

02:47.250 --> 02:50.670
Why are you screaming?
We jumped out before we pretend-died.

02:50.753 --> 02:52.755
Th-th-the door.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.550
A dent!

02:55.633 --> 02:58.469
Dad said there were no dents,
and he'll know it was me!

02:59.178 --> 03:00.430
I'm a dead man.

03:01.097 --> 03:04.267
We told you to stay away from the car.

03:04.350 --> 03:07.145
Please, there's so many things
I haven't done.

03:07.228 --> 03:09.439
Step on Mars, surf lava,

03:09.522 --> 03:11.608
celebrate my 10,000th burp.

03:12.984 --> 03:16.112
It would give us a chance
to test the self-driving car tech

03:16.195 --> 03:17.989
and remote driving app.

03:18.072 --> 03:21.659
But first we need buy some time,
and stall Dad.

03:24.078 --> 03:25.622
He's almost home.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.916
I think the smart watch
we gave him can help.

03:27.999 --> 03:29.959
<i> Don't stop now.</i>

03:30.043 --> 03:32.837
<i>Keep running, and go for your 10k badge.</i>

03:32.921 --> 03:37.258
Whew!
I'm a little tired, smart watch.

03:37.342 --> 03:39.802
<i>But you'll look even younger.</i>

03:39.886 --> 03:42.305
10k badge, here I come!

03:44.515 --> 03:46.184
-It worked!

03:46.267 --> 03:47.268
Now what?

03:47.352 --> 03:52.148
Now we install 17 micro cameras
and 34 autonomous GPS sensors.

03:52.232 --> 03:55.318
Then open the self-driving car app.

04:01.366 --> 04:05.245
OK, we've programmed the car
to take you to Vito's Dent and Body Shop.

04:05.328 --> 04:08.456
Tell them what you need,
then call us when you're done.

04:09.207 --> 04:11.501
It looks like it's smiling at me.

04:11.584 --> 04:12.961
That's because it is.

04:13.044 --> 04:15.630
The app's driving modes
alter the lights and grille

04:15.713 --> 04:18.508
to give the car more personality.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.218
Like cruise…

04:20.301 --> 04:21.803
eco,

04:21.886 --> 04:23.263
and competition mode.

04:25.181 --> 04:28.476
Car makes faces, get to Vito's,
call you when it's done, got it.

04:29.519 --> 04:33.815
And stay low so people will think
you're an old lady with cool hair.

04:33.898 --> 04:37.944
And again, don't touch anything!

04:44.325 --> 04:48.663
Uh, I think you gotta sit higher, Granny,
or people will think nobody's driving.

04:50.915 --> 04:51.874
Too late.

04:53.918 --> 04:56.045
Um, I got a little problem here.

04:56.129 --> 05:01.342
No, you don't, because we also gave
the Lipizzan a smoke screen mode.

05:05.430 --> 05:08.099
-Phew!
-OK, this car… is cool.

05:08.182 --> 05:10.935
And it's even cooler
with some rockin' tunes!

05:13.146 --> 05:15.231
-What was that not-cool sound?

05:15.315 --> 05:18.860
"Disconnecting from App.
Autonomous Mode taking over"?

05:18.943 --> 05:20.862
I just wanted to hear a song.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.700
"Competition mode activated"?!

05:29.370 --> 05:30.788
But look! There's Vito's!

05:30.872 --> 05:33.207
We just have to turn the car off
and push it.

05:33.291 --> 05:34.751
Now, how do you…?

05:38.129 --> 05:39.881
Oh… Oh, no, thank you.

05:39.964 --> 05:41.716
-We're just going to Vito's, and…

05:47.388 --> 05:49.307
I'm gonna close my eyes now.

05:54.854 --> 05:58.232
Ooh, here comes a Lipizzan
just like mine.

06:00.985 --> 06:02.153
Oh.

06:02.236 --> 06:06.199
-Let's hope this is eco mode!

06:08.993 --> 06:11.204
<i>Johnny, what is going on?</i>

06:11.287 --> 06:13.623
I played the radio,
but it wasn't the radio,

06:13.706 --> 06:15.666
and now the car is doing
whatever it wants!

06:16.751 --> 06:21.089
He's now 30 minutes away from Vito's,
and Dad will be home in ten!

06:23.216 --> 06:25.426
<i> Wow, did you get younger?</i>

06:25.510 --> 06:27.345
<i>Turn right here and keep going.</i>

06:28.721 --> 06:30.848
I think that's…
enough running for me--

06:30.932 --> 06:33.142
<i> Turn right,</i>
<i>and don't stop until I tell you!</i>

06:34.936 --> 06:37.230
<i> Johnny, we're sending you</i>
<i>the self-driving app.</i>

06:37.313 --> 06:40.983
<i>You'll be able to Bluetooth-connect</i>
<i>and take back control of the car.</i>

06:45.071 --> 06:47.406
Is there a way to send it faster?

06:47.490 --> 06:49.075
<i> No. Why?</i>

06:49.158 --> 06:51.035
Because it's looking at a billboard.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.371
<i> A billboard for what?</i>

06:56.374 --> 07:00.378
<i> Welcome to</i>
<i>the Porkbelly Demolition Derby!</i>

07:02.255 --> 07:04.674
<i>I'm your guest announcer, Hank Anchorman,</i>

07:04.757 --> 07:09.303
<i>and let's get ready to smash some cars!</i>

07:11.180 --> 07:14.559
<i>And here come the Crashola Brothers,</i>
<i>who are unbeatable,</i>

07:14.642 --> 07:16.853
<i>and wanted in 12 states!</i>

07:17.562 --> 07:20.815
<i>And it looks like they have</i>
<i>a new, adorable challenger.</i>

07:21.941 --> 07:24.610
Well, well, look at the pretty Lipizzan,

07:24.694 --> 07:28.197
driven by a guy who looks like a kid,
but must be old enough to drive,

07:28.281 --> 07:30.241
or he wouldn't be here.

07:31.284 --> 07:36.372
I hope you and your tiny car like pain,
Mr. Really Hairy Guy.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.875
Heh heh. We don't like pain.

07:38.958 --> 07:42.712
<i>Johnny, forget the app, and press</i>
<i>the radio button three times and hold it,</i>

07:42.795 --> 07:44.046
<i>now!</i>

07:44.755 --> 07:46.549
OK, why?

07:50.094 --> 07:51.012
What was that?

07:51.095 --> 07:54.891
<i> We ejected you</i>
<i>so the derby drivers don't destroy you.</i>

07:54.974 --> 07:57.226
And we engaged the emergency brake

07:57.310 --> 07:59.770
so the Lipizzan doesn't destroy
the derby drivers.

07:59.854 --> 08:03.107
<i>Start the demolition derby!</i>

08:05.860 --> 08:10.239
<i>Uh-oh, and the adorable car</i>
<i>looks more like a sitting duck…</i>

08:10.323 --> 08:12.241
-Gah!

08:12.325 --> 08:13.910
The app still hasn't loaded!

08:13.993 --> 08:17.371
<i>…and here come the Crasholas!</i>

08:17.455 --> 08:19.290
Oh… that's a new dent.

08:19.790 --> 08:21.417
-And another…

08:21.501 --> 08:23.628
-…and another.

08:23.711 --> 08:25.046
Maybe your dad won't notice.

08:29.467 --> 08:34.388
OK, it's only four big dents.
Vito can fix that, right?

08:34.472 --> 08:36.307
-Five.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.518
-Yes, the app is loaded!

08:38.601 --> 08:41.395
Now disengage the brake
and let's get out of here!

08:41.479 --> 08:42.980
<i> Ooh!</i>

08:43.064 --> 08:46.734
<i>It looks like a sad car</i>
<i>is ready for the junkyard!</i>

08:50.988 --> 08:53.324
What are you doing?
Get it out of there.

08:54.116 --> 08:57.328
Time to finish you off, baby car!

08:57.411 --> 08:59.413
<i> And here comes the famous,</i>

08:59.497 --> 09:02.667
<i>and possibly illegal, Crashola Crunch!</i>

09:02.750 --> 09:06.546
Nobody dents my dad's dream car but me.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.428
<i>Ooh, the tiny pretty car has come alive,</i>

09:14.512 --> 09:17.014
<i>and suddenly I'm excited!</i>

09:18.849 --> 09:20.560
You went and got popcorn?

09:20.643 --> 09:23.187
Well, if it's your last night on Earth,
you should enjoy it.

09:24.313 --> 09:26.816
-Mm!

09:29.068 --> 09:32.321
<i>Oh! Jimmy Crashola</i>
<i>is knocked out of the ring!</i>

09:33.739 --> 09:35.199
We have fun.

09:38.452 --> 09:41.581
<i>Uh-oh… It looks like Mickey's</i>
<i>stuck in the dirt!</i>

09:41.664 --> 09:43.457
And out of the ring!

09:46.335 --> 09:47.962
Respect, tiny pretty car.

09:49.714 --> 09:52.008
<i>And the Lipizzan wins!</i>

09:55.261 --> 09:57.263
Yes! We won!

09:57.346 --> 10:01.392
But Dad's dream car is trashed,
and I am so dead.

10:01.475 --> 10:06.105
<i>And tonight's big prize…</i>
<i>a one-hour full body repair</i>

10:06.188 --> 10:08.149
<i>from Vito's Dent and Body Shop!</i>

10:09.150 --> 10:11.152
<i>Did he say one hour?</i>

10:11.235 --> 10:12.778
Can you stall Dad that long?

10:12.862 --> 10:15.656
We forgot about Dad!

10:15.740 --> 10:17.950
Let's hope he didn't run too far away!

10:22.246 --> 10:24.290
Hey, poochies.

10:24.373 --> 10:27.001
Wow, you look hungry, and…

10:27.084 --> 10:28.669
and not like dogs.

10:36.093 --> 10:37.803
A little to the right.

10:37.887 --> 10:38.804
A little more…

10:38.888 --> 10:40.139
-No, no. Too far!

10:40.222 --> 10:41.766
That's it!

10:42.475 --> 10:45.519
Yes! We made it back before Dad.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.730
And without a scratch on it.

10:47.813 --> 10:50.358
-Hey, kids. Is your father back yet?

10:51.275 --> 10:53.361
He should be here any minute. Why?

10:53.444 --> 10:55.529
I need to apologize.

10:55.613 --> 10:58.282
I moved my Pela-cycle
back in the garage earlier,

10:58.366 --> 11:00.117
and I dented his door.

11:01.952 --> 11:02.953
Come again?

11:03.537 --> 11:05.706
Oh, look, the dent is gone.

11:05.790 --> 11:08.459
Huh. Oh, well then, never mind.
