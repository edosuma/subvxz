01:28.300 --> 01:29.633
Um...

01:29.733 --> 01:31.067
I'll take this one.

01:31.133 --> 01:32.400
That one.

01:34.067 --> 01:35.367
Oh, look.

01:35.800 --> 01:36.767
This.

01:36.867 --> 01:39.567
Oh, really?
This one's for me.

01:41.767 --> 01:43.900
Oh, I want that, too.

01:44.067 --> 01:45.467
I like those.
You do?

01:46.733 --> 01:50.833
Oh, Maude,
isn't that stunning?

01:50.933 --> 01:52.067
I'd rather have mink.

01:52.133 --> 01:54.533
You would?
Mink is so every day.

01:54.633 --> 01:57.233
I don't care.
We're wishing for
what we want, aren't we?

01:57.333 --> 01:59.067
Yeah.
Well, I want mink.

01:59.133 --> 02:03.067
Well, all right.
Have mink.
I want chinchilla.

02:04.733 --> 02:06.167
What do you
spend on lunches?

02:06.633 --> 02:07.867
Depends.

02:09.300 --> 02:11.667
Can't you give me
an average?

02:11.767 --> 02:14.333
Well, 65 cents.
(TALKING UNDER BREATH)

02:14.433 --> 02:16.367
Four... Two...

02:16.467 --> 02:18.267
65.

02:18.367 --> 02:23.333
(UNDER BREATH)
65 times six, that's
3.90 a week. Hmm...

02:23.433 --> 02:24.867
How about car fare?

02:26.833 --> 02:29.267
30 cents a day.
30 cents a day.

02:30.067 --> 02:33.733
(SPEAKING TO SELF)

02:33.833 --> 02:37.100
Well, I'll have
to say the same,
it's the same...

02:39.667 --> 02:44.067
Well, if you don't spend
more than a quarter
a day for lunch,

02:44.100 --> 02:47.833
and if you don't wear
stockings, you don't
go to the movies,

02:47.933 --> 02:50.067
unless somebody takes you,

02:50.100 --> 02:51.300
you can go to school.

02:51.400 --> 02:54.533
Oh, yes,
and you can't buy
any more magazines.

02:55.333 --> 02:57.433
Gee, maybe
it isn't worth it.

02:57.533 --> 03:00.133
Maybe you want to spend
the rest of your life
as a carhop, huh?

03:00.233 --> 03:02.400
Oh, don't be a stoop.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.300
Ooh, my feet
are just killing me.

03:04.400 --> 03:05.967
Everything swells up
in the heat.

03:06.067 --> 03:09.300
It isn't the heat,
it's the humidity...
It's the humidity, yeah.

03:09.400 --> 03:10.833
Whose turn to wash?

03:10.933 --> 03:12.700
Yours, I dry.

03:14.667 --> 03:16.867
Well, I'll get started.

03:16.967 --> 03:20.500
No, I just meant,
why couldn't you help me
get a modeling job now?

03:20.600 --> 03:22.333
I've told you 10 times,

03:22.433 --> 03:24.433
I don't want to
use my influence
'til you're ready,

03:24.533 --> 03:26.400
and you won't be ready
'til you go to school.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.667
According to this, I won't
need your old influence.

03:28.767 --> 03:30.133
Hmm.

03:30.233 --> 03:33.900
"Dorothy Dale places
all her graduates
in the finest positions."

03:34.067 --> 03:36.733
Mmm, she looks
like a pretty nifty number.
MAXINE: Yeah.

03:36.833 --> 03:38.433
I'll bet this was retouched.

03:38.533 --> 03:40.733
You know, you're
not going just
to get a better job.

03:40.833 --> 03:43.867
A charm school's like
college and finishing
school combined.

03:43.967 --> 03:45.700
I can read, Maxine.

03:45.800 --> 03:48.667
Well, all I can say is
without a social education,

03:48.767 --> 03:50.567
you're never going
to meet a real man.

03:50.667 --> 03:52.567
And what's the matter
with George?

03:52.667 --> 03:54.967
He'll never be able
to buy you a mink coat.

03:55.067 --> 03:56.833
"Girls," Dorothy Dale asks,

03:56.933 --> 03:58.600
"What is your most
important asset?"

03:58.700 --> 04:01.067
Answer, "Your smile.
Be charming."

04:01.167 --> 04:02.900
Uh-hmm, be charming,
that's what I told you.

04:03.067 --> 04:04.767
(SIGHS) Oh, dear,

04:04.867 --> 04:08.067
I'd love to go back to
Denver with a mink coat
someday, Maxine.

04:08.167 --> 04:09.300
Mmm-hmm.

04:09.400 --> 04:12.833
Two mink coats,
one for my mother.

04:12.933 --> 04:15.633
I guess it won't kill me
to have 25-cent lunches.

04:15.733 --> 04:18.966
No. You still
have to wear
stockings anyway.

04:19.067 --> 04:21.200
How long a course
should I take, Maxine?

04:21.300 --> 04:22.633
Six weeks.

04:23.900 --> 04:24.967
Gee,

04:25.067 --> 04:26.933
wouldn't it be wonderful if...

04:27.067 --> 04:31.100
If after I graduate, I start
working in the model...
And modeling in the store

04:31.200 --> 04:32.800
like you for
a few weeks and...

04:33.533 --> 04:35.967
And then one day,

04:36.067 --> 04:38.400
in walks a handsome,
young millionaire.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.133
Yeah. Wouldn't it
be wonderful?

04:40.233 --> 04:43.233
And he's standing at the
perfume counter and...

04:43.333 --> 04:46.700
And then suddenly
he turns around
and sees me.

04:46.800 --> 04:49.433
And we don't say a word
for a long time and...

04:49.533 --> 04:50.500
And then he says...

04:50.600 --> 04:52.900
Will you start
drying the dishes?

04:53.067 --> 04:57.133
(SIGHS)
Okay, but, it could happen.

04:57.233 --> 04:59.267
Uh-hmm.
Dorothy Dale says,

04:59.367 --> 05:02.100
"A charm school
girl's future
is unlimited.

05:02.200 --> 05:05.433
"Once she leaves
our doors, she is ready
to meet anyone socially

05:05.533 --> 05:07.833
"and ready
to hit her jackpot."
See?

05:13.067 --> 05:15.167
Good evening,
Miss Chambers.
Good evening, Miss Blaine.

05:15.267 --> 05:16.800
Good evening,
Miss Chambers.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.533
Oh, Miss Eames...

05:19.333 --> 05:20.833
About your tuition...

05:20.933 --> 05:23.633
You know, each week
must be paid in advance.

05:23.733 --> 05:26.300
Oh, I'm sorry,
Miss Chambers.
(RINGING)

05:27.267 --> 05:29.833
Dorothy Dale
School of Charm.

05:29.933 --> 05:32.367
Oh, yes, we'd be glad
to recommend a model.

05:33.633 --> 05:35.900
All of our models
are highly qualified.

05:37.067 --> 05:39.467
Yes, Mr. Lawrence,
she'll be there at 9:00.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.533
Thank you.

05:42.100 --> 05:43.133
(RECEIVER REPLACED)

05:43.233 --> 05:45.067
Look, could I give
you five now and...

05:45.167 --> 05:46.933
And the other five
when I come Thursday?

05:47.867 --> 05:49.067
Thursday?

05:49.167 --> 05:51.300
Thursday.
Certainly.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.067
Miss Maude Eames,

05:53.567 --> 05:55.167
five dollars.

05:55.267 --> 05:58.800
Oh, would you mind
making that Leonora Eames?
I've changed it.

05:59.200 --> 06:00.533
Not at all.

06:00.633 --> 06:01.800
"Leonora."

06:01.900 --> 06:04.067
"Leonora," that's charming!

06:04.133 --> 06:05.133
Thank you.

06:06.767 --> 06:07.933
Thank you.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.833
It was a lovely luncheon,
Mrs. Burton.

06:14.933 --> 06:16.133
"Burton."

06:16.700 --> 06:17.933
"Bur-ton."

06:18.067 --> 06:19.833
Thank you so much
for having me.

06:19.933 --> 06:21.400
Pick up your bag.

06:21.500 --> 06:24.200
Oh, I'm sorry.
Thank you.

06:26.667 --> 06:29.167
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.

06:29.267 --> 06:31.367
Bravo that was
quite nice.

06:32.433 --> 06:34.333
Cross your legs,
my dear.

06:34.433 --> 06:36.467
Now, may we have
Miss Eames?

06:36.567 --> 06:37.667
Yes, Miss Dale.

06:37.767 --> 06:39.633
More confidence, my dear.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.867
Speak out, full tones.

06:42.967 --> 06:44.767
What is your favorite fur?

06:44.867 --> 06:46.600
Mink.
Mink.

06:46.700 --> 06:48.500
Mine too.

06:48.600 --> 06:52.567
Well, believe it
or not, this is
a beautiful mink coat.

06:54.100 --> 06:55.767
(MOTOR WHIRRING)

07:02.900 --> 07:05.967
WOMAN: Fourth floor,
cosmetics, jewelry,
perfume and furs.

07:09.567 --> 07:11.300
Oh, Miss, just a minute.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.733
Only 4995, plus tax.

07:13.833 --> 07:15.600
Five thousand,
that's not too bad.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.867
Do you like
the full back?
Oh, I adore it.

07:17.967 --> 07:20.700
The skins are divine.
Simply heavenly.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.467
Wally signed
his contract
with Metro yet?

07:22.567 --> 07:23.867
No, not yet.

07:23.967 --> 07:26.200
Come along, darling.
Better have
the old one glazed.

07:26.300 --> 07:27.533
Oh, you're right.

07:27.633 --> 07:29.500
I'd rather make
him buy me
a new bracelet anyway.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.067
Of course
you would, darling.

07:33.400 --> 07:34.733
Like it, darling?

07:34.833 --> 07:37.533
Oh, I hope you're
not offended, because
I call everyone darling.

07:37.633 --> 07:39.467
What a charming coat.

07:39.567 --> 07:41.667
Uh, may I see the lining?

07:41.767 --> 07:45.400
Only 4995, plus tax.

07:45.500 --> 07:48.200
Plus tax, charming,
darling, charming.

07:48.300 --> 07:51.500
I think we
haven't been working
here long, yes?

07:51.867 --> 07:52.867
Yes.

07:52.967 --> 07:55.167
Hold this a moment,
will you, darling?

07:55.267 --> 07:59.200
I'm giving a party,
a lovely party
this weekend, on a yacht.

07:59.300 --> 08:01.600
There. (BLOWS)
We go to Catalina.

08:01.700 --> 08:03.067
No, thank you.

08:03.133 --> 08:06.133
There'll be lots
of people, darling.
Fresh air, sunshine, and,

08:06.233 --> 08:08.100
if you don't like it,
you can leave.

08:08.200 --> 08:11.500
No, thanks.
Now, don't be a silly
bourgeois, darling.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.900
You have work to do,
I have work to do. Now,

08:14.067 --> 08:16.300
we can chat here for
hours but...

08:16.400 --> 08:19.300
We would still
get to the same point,
wouldn't we?

08:19.400 --> 08:23.233
The yacht belongs
to my business associate,
charming.

08:25.500 --> 08:28.133
We leave from my place
at 6:30 on Friday.

08:28.800 --> 08:29.933
Uh...

08:31.567 --> 08:33.933
It will be divine, darling.

08:35.167 --> 08:38.232
Nice relaxation.
Toodle-oo.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.633
Did you get
an invitation?

08:43.732 --> 08:46.167
I'm not going.
You're out
of your head.

08:46.267 --> 08:48.367
9995, handmade from...

08:48.467 --> 08:49.733
Sorry, just looking.

08:51.267 --> 08:52.933
Don't you know
who the party's for?

08:53.067 --> 08:54.500
Smith Ohlrig,
whoever that is.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.433
Only the "Wall"
in Wall Street, dearie.

08:56.533 --> 08:57.733
The little poodle
works for him.

08:57.833 --> 08:59.667
Mmm-hmm?
Mmm-hmm.

08:59.767 --> 09:02.967
9995,
handmade from...
Here, darling.

09:05.533 --> 09:07.067
Those parties are
supposed to be terrific.

09:07.100 --> 09:08.433
They'll have to do
without me.

09:08.533 --> 09:10.067
Poor you.

09:12.067 --> 09:14.867
Only 4995, plus tax.

09:17.467 --> 09:18.933
I'm not going, Maxine.

09:19.067 --> 09:22.733
How else do poor girls
like us get to meet
guys like Ohlrig?

09:22.833 --> 09:26.233
It's just no use, Maxine.
I just... Look terrible.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.300
I'm not going.
All in your head.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.400
I'm not the type
for this dress and...

09:31.133 --> 09:33.500
This zipper!

09:33.600 --> 09:36.133
And I'm not
the type for the
yachting party either.

09:36.233 --> 09:38.133
How do you know?
You've never
been on one.

09:38.233 --> 09:40.367
That's the only
reason I wanted to go.

09:40.467 --> 09:43.233
Just to find out
what it would be like,

09:43.333 --> 09:45.633
but not with those characters.

09:45.733 --> 09:48.567
Any man that goes
to a party like that
has just one idea,

09:48.667 --> 09:50.767
and that's one idea
too many for me.

09:50.867 --> 09:52.500
You can take care
of yourself.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.600
I don't want to go to a
party where I have to worry
about taking care of myself.

09:56.100 --> 09:57.967
Unzip me, please.

09:58.067 --> 10:00.133
Well, it's up to you.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.500
But the party is an
investment, Nora.
I know, I know,

10:02.600 --> 10:03.667
I should think of security.

10:03.767 --> 10:05.067
That's right.
(KNOCKING)
Hi.

10:05.167 --> 10:06.633
Who is it?
Velma.

10:06.733 --> 10:08.000
Velma, see?

10:08.100 --> 10:10.433
And what is
security? Money.

10:10.533 --> 10:12.833
Period.
Exclamation point.

10:13.267 --> 10:14.267
Hello.
Hi.

10:14.367 --> 10:15.700
Um, here's
the fur, girls,

10:15.800 --> 10:18.133
and I'm sorry I'm
late, but I had to...
Oh, thanks, but...

10:18.233 --> 10:19.867
Maybe you
ought to go home.

10:20.300 --> 10:21.833
Oh, well...

10:21.933 --> 10:24.367
I brought some gloves
in case you needed them.
Thanks.

10:24.467 --> 10:26.033
They're stunning,
Velma, thanks a lot.

10:26.133 --> 10:27.867
Well, I really don't
have to go yet...
I'll see you tomorrow.

10:27.967 --> 10:29.667
What's the matter?
Please, Velma, I'll
talk to you tomorrow.

10:29.767 --> 10:31.900
Can't I see how she goes
with my own wrap?
Go on now, Velma.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.900
Well, have a good time
anyway, Honey!
Yeah, yeah.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.967
And spill some
champagne on...
Yeah, goodbye.

10:36.067 --> 10:38.367
Thanks a lot.
And if he has friend,
don't forget about me.

10:39.333 --> 10:41.233
I'll look terrible
in that too.

10:41.333 --> 10:43.300
Wait 'til I finish
pressing your coat.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.933
Well, you can put this
around your shoulders
and it will look just fine.

10:46.033 --> 10:48.133
Please don't
get mad, but it's...
It's just that...

10:48.233 --> 10:50.200
Well, I resent
the whole setup.

10:50.300 --> 10:52.400
Resent it?

10:52.500 --> 10:56.900
Yes, right from the beginning
when that slimy little man
crawled up to me in the store

10:57.000 --> 10:58.900
and wiggled
his eyebrows. It...

10:59.667 --> 11:01.433
It just makes me feel cheap.

11:01.533 --> 11:02.900
Let's face it.

11:03.067 --> 11:05.167
Girls like us
can't pick the way
we meet like men like...

11:05.267 --> 11:07.133
Men like Smith Ohlrig.

11:07.233 --> 11:08.600
Why, you
should be grateful.

11:08.700 --> 11:10.067
Well, I'm not.

11:10.100 --> 11:11.400
Oh, no,

11:11.500 --> 11:13.800
you want to keep
dreaming about little
ol' prince charming

11:13.900 --> 11:15.067
on a golden horse.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.867
You feel cheap.

11:16.967 --> 11:19.067
Well, that's touching.

11:19.167 --> 11:20.533
Now, let me tell you,

11:20.633 --> 11:23.533
I'd be very glad,
believe me, to be
in your shoes.

11:24.200 --> 11:25.900
For Pete's sake,

11:27.333 --> 11:30.900
here you are with a chance
to meet some decent men.

11:31.067 --> 11:33.833
Men that could take you out
of living in dump like this.

11:35.267 --> 11:36.267
You...

11:37.667 --> 11:40.367
Oh, you don't know
a break when you get it.

11:44.567 --> 11:45.733
(WATER LAPPING)

11:51.400 --> 11:53.100
(APPROACHING MOTOR)

12:09.533 --> 12:10.933
(MOTOR CUTS)

12:18.933 --> 12:21.333
Are you from
the Ohlrig yacht?
MAN: That's right.

12:21.433 --> 12:24.833
Oh, thank goodness.
I thought they'd never send
somebody to pick me up.

12:24.933 --> 12:26.733
They didn't send me.
Oh.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.600
I have some business
to take care of.

12:28.700 --> 12:31.100
Well, couldn't
you take me
to the yacht first?

12:32.567 --> 12:34.733
Don't say yacht,
say boat.

12:34.833 --> 12:36.900
Boat, then.
Couldn't you, please?

12:37.067 --> 12:39.933
It's not a very good
party. In fact, it's one
of the dullest they've had.

12:40.067 --> 12:42.267
Oh, I don't care,
I've got to get there.

12:42.367 --> 12:43.400
Why?

12:43.967 --> 12:45.067
Well, because...

12:45.100 --> 12:47.400
Oh, I don't think that's
any of your concern.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.767
Well, if you're in
such a hurry, why didn't
you come with the others?

12:49.867 --> 12:52.100
Well, I couldn't
get off work in time.

12:52.200 --> 12:53.567
I'm a model.

12:53.667 --> 12:57.500
I phoned Mr. Kartos
before he arrived, but

12:57.600 --> 13:00.767
he said he'd send a taxi
out and then somebody
would pick me up.

13:00.867 --> 13:03.700
If you want to wait 'til
I finish my business,
I'll take you out.

13:03.800 --> 13:04.933
You couldn't
take me now?

13:05.067 --> 13:06.367
No.

13:06.467 --> 13:09.567
Well, in that case
I'll just have to wait
'til you're ready then.

13:11.100 --> 13:12.300
Come on.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.467
Where?

13:14.500 --> 13:16.067
Come drive
to the office with me.

13:16.133 --> 13:18.600
Oh, I couldn't
do that.
Why not?

13:18.700 --> 13:20.800
Well, in the first
place, I don't know
who you are,

13:20.900 --> 13:23.467
except that you
say you're from
the Ohlrig yacht,

13:23.567 --> 13:27.400
and in the second place,
I owe that taxi driver $6.50

13:27.500 --> 13:29.667
which Mr. Kartos said...
I'll take care of him.

13:32.467 --> 13:35.067
My name is Leonora Eames,
what's yours?

13:35.133 --> 13:36.300
Smith Ohlrig.

13:43.167 --> 13:45.367
MAN: Well, it can't be done
that way, Mr. Ohlrig,

13:45.467 --> 13:46.600
but if you're
willing to spend...

13:46.700 --> 13:49.300
SMITH OHLRIG: I do not make
money by throwing it away.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.733
Good night.
Good night.

13:50.833 --> 13:53.300
Goodbye, Mr. Ohlrig.
Good night.

13:55.267 --> 13:57.067
Sorry, it had to be
so long, but I'm
trying to set up

13:57.133 --> 13:58.467
a new organization here.

13:58.567 --> 14:00.200
Oh, that's
perfectly all right,

14:00.300 --> 14:02.300
I was having
a delightful catnap.

14:03.200 --> 14:04.733
(SHIP HORN)

14:04.833 --> 14:08.767
There's so many people
on the boat, do you mind
if we drive back to town?

14:08.867 --> 14:10.400
Oh, not at all, Mr. Ohlrig.

14:10.500 --> 14:12.600
I'd love to.
Well, that's fine.

14:29.467 --> 14:31.067
(CHUCKLES)

14:31.167 --> 14:34.333
I don't see what's so funny
about learning how to walk
with a book on your head.

14:34.700 --> 14:36.133
I'm sorry.

14:36.233 --> 14:38.067
What did you
say the name
of that place was?

14:38.100 --> 14:40.533
Dorothy Dale
School of Charm.
(SNICKERS)

14:40.633 --> 14:43.533
It's quite famous. It is!

14:43.633 --> 14:45.633
I wish you wouldn't
drive so fast.

14:45.733 --> 14:48.133
I like it, and I'm
a good driver.

14:48.233 --> 14:49.667
I'm sure you are but...

14:49.767 --> 14:51.933
Didn't your Charm
School teach you to be
agreeable to your escort?

14:52.300 --> 14:53.367
Yes.

14:56.467 --> 14:58.300
What else did
they teach you?

14:58.400 --> 15:00.867
Oh, diction and make-up
and fencing.

15:00.967 --> 15:02.433
Mr. Devough taught that.

15:02.533 --> 15:04.400
And posture
and social usage.

15:05.167 --> 15:06.233
Social what?

15:06.700 --> 15:08.067
Usage, you know.

15:08.100 --> 15:10.100
Conversation etiquette,
how to pour tea,

15:10.200 --> 15:12.633
how to listen
to music, how to...

15:12.733 --> 15:14.267
Please watch the road.

15:14.700 --> 15:16.067
Mmm-hmm.

15:19.867 --> 15:21.233
Where are you from?

15:21.333 --> 15:22.433
Denver.

15:22.533 --> 15:24.100
Family poor?
Yes.

15:24.200 --> 15:25.733
How long have you
been in Los Angeles?

15:25.833 --> 15:27.700
Almost five years.
Doing what?

15:27.800 --> 15:28.767
Working.

15:28.867 --> 15:29.833
Who paid...
Modeling.

15:29.933 --> 15:33.300
Who paid for
your charm school?
I did.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.700
How many weekend
yachting trips
have you been on?

15:36.067 --> 15:37.100
None.

15:37.200 --> 15:40.067
All right, how many
Hollywood parties then?
None.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.867
Come on.
I haven't!

15:41.967 --> 15:44.533
Why not?
Nobody else asked me.

15:44.633 --> 15:47.833
There's some cigarettes
in the glove compartment,
light one for me.

15:49.633 --> 15:51.733
What do you
know about me?

15:51.833 --> 15:53.433
Oh, uh...

15:53.533 --> 15:55.800
I know you're
from the east.
New York.

15:57.867 --> 15:59.067
And I know you're
sort of a...

15:59.167 --> 16:01.400
Of an
international something.

16:01.500 --> 16:03.567
Well, that just about
describes it.

16:07.433 --> 16:09.067
What else?

16:09.100 --> 16:11.067
And you're rich.

16:11.133 --> 16:13.567
How rich?
Oh, very rich.

16:14.900 --> 16:16.767
(EXHALES)
What else?

16:16.867 --> 16:19.233
Well, I know that
you've never been
married before.

16:20.333 --> 16:22.467
And I'm not
going to be either.

16:57.467 --> 16:58.767
Where are we?

16:58.867 --> 17:00.833
At the house,
my house.

17:03.733 --> 17:05.267
No.

17:05.367 --> 17:06.900
Come in and have a drink.

17:10.133 --> 17:13.300
Don't be a silly girl,
you knew you weren't
just taking a drive.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.367
Please take me home,
Mr. Ohlrig.

17:17.067 --> 17:18.833
Come on, don't you
think I like you?

17:21.067 --> 17:23.166
Take me home.

17:23.267 --> 17:26.067
Didn't the charm
school tell you
how to handle this?

17:27.067 --> 17:28.567
I'm sorry.

17:30.067 --> 17:31.567
I just want to go home.

17:31.667 --> 17:32.933
Skip it.

17:43.833 --> 17:46.867
OHLRIG: I took her home
and we said good night.

17:46.967 --> 17:49.400
That happens three
or four more times
and then I dropped her.

17:49.900 --> 17:50.967
Why?

17:51.800 --> 17:53.500
They come a dime a dozen.

17:54.633 --> 17:57.367
I thought from
what you said before that

17:57.467 --> 18:00.767
she was sweeter
than most of the girls.

18:00.867 --> 18:04.067
Psychoanalysts
and elephants,
they never forget.

18:05.433 --> 18:08.067
Oh, I think this is
all pointless anyway.

18:08.167 --> 18:09.867
Well, why did you
come here?

18:09.967 --> 18:11.633
'Cause I don't like
getting upset so easily

18:11.733 --> 18:13.433
and you're supposed
to be able to calm me.

18:13.533 --> 18:16.633
I can, if you'll work
with me, not against me.

18:17.633 --> 18:20.367
Let's go back to the girl.

18:20.467 --> 18:24.500
Well, for your information,
she's after precisely the
same thing everyone's after,

18:24.600 --> 18:25.933
my money.

18:26.067 --> 18:29.433
Well, maybe the girl
feels that you just want
to play around with her.

18:29.533 --> 18:32.567
Well, she's right if she
does. You don't think I
want to marry her, do you?

18:32.667 --> 18:34.867
I certainly hope not.

18:34.967 --> 18:37.500
If I persisted long enough,
I could get where I want.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.067
I wish business
were as easy.

18:39.100 --> 18:41.167
Yesterday, I had
to battle with some
grubby little man

18:41.267 --> 18:42.967
from noon until
2:00 in the morning,

18:43.067 --> 18:45.133
and I had one of those
idiotic attacks.

18:45.233 --> 18:46.500
A heart attack?

18:47.467 --> 18:50.333
Yes, and I go to
a specialist for that.

18:50.433 --> 18:53.700
I think they're just
a nervous reaction.

18:53.800 --> 18:58.067
About a year ago,
you wanted to buy
out a rubber company

18:58.100 --> 19:02.067
and the owner didn't
want to sell.
So you had an attack.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.567
The next one occurred
in that South American...
I get it.

19:04.667 --> 19:06.733
I get the connection.

19:06.833 --> 19:08.967
Whenever I can't
get what I want,
I have an attack,

19:09.067 --> 19:10.400
is that your theory?

19:10.500 --> 19:13.867
Yes. There's nothing
organically wrong
with your heart,

19:13.967 --> 19:15.833
so why the attacks?

19:15.933 --> 19:19.167
Well, let's consider whether
it's just a way of saying,

19:19.267 --> 19:22.533
"I'm not all-powerful,
I'm weak,"

19:22.633 --> 19:25.167
"take pity, give me
what I want."

19:29.367 --> 19:32.300
I have these
attacks because
I have a bad heart,

19:32.400 --> 19:34.400
but that's too
simple for you.

19:34.500 --> 19:37.800
You have to find some
insane Freudian reason.

19:37.900 --> 19:40.300
Heart attacks
because I want pity.

19:40.400 --> 19:42.433
And what are some of
your other little gems?

19:42.533 --> 19:44.733
I must destroy
everyone I can't own?

19:44.833 --> 19:46.800
I'm afraid all anyone
wants is my money?

19:46.900 --> 19:47.867
Well, it...
I'll never marry

19:47.967 --> 19:49.433
because I'd only
be married for my money?

19:49.533 --> 19:50.733
I didn't...
Don't say you
didn't say that

19:50.833 --> 19:51.867
because you did,
admit it.

19:51.967 --> 19:53.733
I only said that...
Well, you're
wrong, Doctor,

19:53.833 --> 19:55.567
dead wrong. I am
going to get married.

19:56.267 --> 19:58.700
I'm not afraid of anyone.

19:58.800 --> 20:01.167
And what's more, you
want to know something?
(DIALING)

20:01.267 --> 20:03.000
I'm going to
marry that girl.

20:05.900 --> 20:06.967
You don't
believe me, do you?

20:08.333 --> 20:09.933
Hello, Franzi?

20:10.033 --> 20:12.333
We're taking a plane
to Yuma as soon as
you can get a hold of,

20:12.433 --> 20:15.333
uh, Leonora...
Uh, what's her name?

20:15.433 --> 20:16.767
Yes, Eames.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.333
Why do you think?

20:19.433 --> 20:21.333
I'm going to get married.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.367
Sorry to cut off
a major source of
your income, Doctor,

20:25.467 --> 20:27.300
but you won't
see me again.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.033
It's up to you.
Completely.

20:30.067 --> 20:31.800
And I do as I please.

20:31.900 --> 20:35.033
Yes, that's why
you made your call.

20:35.133 --> 20:37.333
I said I didn't think
you'd marry,

20:37.433 --> 20:40.800
and so you've made
arrangements
to prove I'm wrong.

20:40.900 --> 20:44.033
You don't really
want to marry this girl.

20:44.133 --> 20:47.367
You've only done this
because you're angry at me,

20:47.467 --> 20:51.167
and to prove
that no one has
authority over you.

20:51.267 --> 20:55.033
A marriage like this
will only ruin
the girl, and you.

20:57.367 --> 20:58.600
That's your opinion.

21:28.600 --> 21:31.100
Beg pardon, Madam,
luncheon is ready.

21:31.200 --> 21:32.700
Oh, thank you.

21:41.900 --> 21:44.533
But, do you mean
he actually doesn't
get home until midnight?

21:44.633 --> 21:45.900
Sometimes even later.

21:46.067 --> 21:47.833
What do you do, wait up
and polish your jewelry?
Thank you.

21:47.933 --> 21:49.500
Oh, they look so
good, I'll take two.

21:49.600 --> 21:53.700
Well, I usually pick him
up at whatever warehouse
or office he's at.

21:53.800 --> 21:56.067
Yes please. Warehouse?
Uh-huh. What then?
No, thank you.

21:56.167 --> 21:59.533
What then? Oh, then
we drive to the beach
or some little joint.

21:59.633 --> 22:02.167
Money and romance,
lucky girl.
No, thanks.

22:02.267 --> 22:05.433
Yes, except that Franzi
or one of the other men
is always along.

22:05.533 --> 22:06.600
Sounds cozy.

22:06.700 --> 22:08.533
Well, he's just
there, I guess.

22:09.633 --> 22:11.900
Altogether, we're
a very cozy couple.

22:12.067 --> 22:13.667
What's the matter, Hon?

22:13.767 --> 22:15.400
Oh, I just think that

22:15.500 --> 22:18.367
Smith wishes that
he hadn't married me.

22:18.467 --> 22:20.900
Oh, the minute
you get rich,
you get neurotic.

22:21.067 --> 22:22.533
No, but I mean it.

22:22.633 --> 22:23.967
I don't blame him.

22:24.067 --> 22:27.600
I don't know how to
fit in to all of this
or how to behave.

22:27.700 --> 22:29.500
Enjoy it, that's how.

22:29.600 --> 22:32.467
And I'm sure he thinks
that I married him
for his money.

22:32.567 --> 22:33.933
No comment.

22:35.667 --> 22:37.367
You know I didn't.

22:37.467 --> 22:39.300
I could never
do a thing like that.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.967
You really love him,
don't you?

22:41.067 --> 22:42.167
Yes.

22:42.267 --> 22:44.067
May I have
the butter, please?

22:45.367 --> 22:47.700
Now, look, so everything
isn't billing and cooing.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.767
So you didn't have
a honeymoon, so you
don't see him alone.

22:49.867 --> 22:50.967
When you get
married, you want...

22:51.067 --> 22:52.900
So you think this
and he thinks that,
who cares?

22:53.067 --> 22:54.433
Look at that house!

22:54.533 --> 22:56.567
Look at the charge
account, look at us!

22:56.667 --> 22:58.233
Lunch by
the swimming pool,

22:58.333 --> 23:00.933
and look at this
silver and this glass,

23:01.067 --> 23:02.467
look at this table.

23:02.567 --> 23:04.267
Oh, honey, you're rich.

23:05.067 --> 23:07.633
Yeah, rich but...

23:54.333 --> 23:57.067
I wish I could
go to bed.
So do I.

24:02.167 --> 24:04.667
It's almost 3:00, Franzi.

24:05.700 --> 24:08.067
Tough, take a pill.

24:08.100 --> 24:10.933
I've lived on pills
ever since I came east.

24:11.700 --> 24:13.500
That's 10 months.

24:14.600 --> 24:15.967
I won't anymore.

24:18.467 --> 24:21.233
Then play with the
necklace he gave you
for your anniversary.

24:21.700 --> 24:22.867
Yes,

24:24.500 --> 24:27.300
instead of that honeymoon trip
we'll never take.

24:28.767 --> 24:31.467
Instead of going to
Denver to see my family,

24:33.100 --> 24:35.633
instead of having
dinner together,

24:35.733 --> 24:39.467
spending time together,
and being together like
other married people.

24:44.567 --> 24:46.933
No.

24:47.067 --> 24:51.067
All he wants me to do
is sit here and wait until
he phones or comes home.

24:52.067 --> 24:54.367
And I see him exactly
for one hour.

24:55.400 --> 24:56.833

24:56.933 --> 25:00.967
FRANZI: Tough, you got
what you wanted, darling,
you're wearing it.

25:01.067 --> 25:04.967
You mustn't expect
him to pick up your
handkerchief too.

25:05.067 --> 25:08.600
Maybe money is
enough for you.
Of course, isn't it for you?

25:10.233 --> 25:11.733
No.

25:11.833 --> 25:14.133
Why else marry
a madman like that?

25:15.600 --> 25:18.300
But he wasn't like this
before we were married.

25:18.400 --> 25:19.967
He was a bachelor.

25:20.067 --> 25:22.100
He was a human being.

25:22.200 --> 25:25.100
Tough, buy yourself
a new hat.

25:25.200 --> 25:27.500

a greedy little

25:39.067 --> 25:41.467
and you're getting

No.

You know where
the projection room is?
Sure, Mr. Ohlrig.

Well, there's
some sandwiches...

you'd be alone.

I'll go to bed.

so funny, Leonora?

a laugh out of me, I'd just
like to know what it was.

at you, Smith.

it was something I said.

No.

you meant to,

you were sorry.

want me to want you.

you'd have everything.

Well, it's not
that easy.

31:21.600 --> 31:24.900
The world is clammy
with people who think
that way and they sicken me.

31:26.100 --> 31:29.433
I was born rich. My father
left me four million dollars,

31:29.533 --> 31:32.733
but I didn't drink it away,
I didn't gamble it away,
I didn't marry it away.

knows anything
about each other.

of that charm school

all there is to do.

35:45.333 --> 35:47.567
Yes, Doctor.
Oh, what a world.

35:48.667 --> 35:50.333
Uh, Mrs. Dobroeh?

35:50.433 --> 35:52.333
Mrs. Dobroeh?
I'm Mrs. Dobroeh.

35:52.433 --> 35:54.533
Will you step into
the doctor's office?

35:54.633 --> 35:55.967
I was on time.

35:56.067 --> 35:57.967
Oh, yes, I know you were,
but he's been called
out on an emergency

35:58.067 --> 35:59.700
but he'll be right
back, right back,

35:59.800 --> 36:02.200
and I'll go and see
if the doctor can
see you now, my dear.

36:02.300 --> 36:04.233
(WHISTLING)
Doctor?
(KNOCKING)

36:04.333 --> 36:07.567
Dr. Quinada?
Kevin, please stop that!
Kevin.

36:07.667 --> 36:09.167
Will you see Miss...

36:09.267 --> 36:11.100
Miss, what is your name?

36:11.200 --> 36:15.133
Eames.
Miss Eames
about that job?

36:15.233 --> 36:19.400
Let's do it again.
Okay, but do it
with me this time.

36:19.500 --> 36:23.200
(BOTH)
Here is the church,
here is the steeple.

36:23.733 --> 36:24.867
Open the door...

36:24.967 --> 36:26.467
No, open the door
like this.

36:26.567 --> 36:28.067
That's right.
MAN: Miss Eames?

36:28.167 --> 36:29.400
Oh, just a minute.

36:29.500 --> 36:32.067
(BOTH)
And see all the people.
That's right, that's good.

36:32.100 --> 36:33.967
(KEVIN BLOWS WHISTLE)

36:35.333 --> 36:36.300
(WHISTLE)

36:36.400 --> 36:37.767
Would you
come in, please?

36:39.900 --> 36:41.167
Keep it down, Kevin.

36:42.500 --> 36:45.067
Kevin, if you
don't be quiet,
I'll break your neck.

36:46.467 --> 36:48.400
You have
a knack with kids.

36:48.500 --> 36:49.667
I like them.

36:49.767 --> 36:51.467
They come pretty
tough down here.

36:51.567 --> 36:53.333
They did where
I came from, too.

36:53.433 --> 36:55.100
You weren't born
under the elevators.

36:55.200 --> 36:56.433
Neither were you.

36:56.533 --> 36:59.267
No, a little closer
to Park Avenue,
but I could hear it.

37:00.367 --> 37:02.533
You know what
the job is, Miss Eames?

37:02.633 --> 37:03.700
Receptionist.

37:03.800 --> 37:05.867
Yes, for Dr. Hoffman
and me.

37:05.967 --> 37:08.533
He's an obstetrician,
I'm a pediatrician.

37:08.633 --> 37:11.533
He brings children
into the world,
I try to keep them here.

37:11.633 --> 37:13.200
I'm sure you
succeed, Doctor.

37:13.300 --> 37:14.633
Well, I don't always.

37:14.733 --> 37:16.800
It's easier to write
prescriptions than
to pay for them.

37:16.900 --> 37:18.067
What experience
have you had?

37:19.067 --> 37:21.433
Well, I was trained
to be a receptionist.

37:21.533 --> 37:22.667
Where?

37:22.767 --> 37:24.900
In Los Angeles,
the Dale School.

37:25.067 --> 37:26.500
Dale School, huh?

37:26.600 --> 37:28.067
Have you worked
in New York?

37:28.100 --> 37:29.067
No.

37:29.167 --> 37:31.133
I see. How long
have you been here?

37:31.667 --> 37:33.233
Less than a year.

37:33.333 --> 37:35.833
Well, that's a long time,
what have you been doing?

37:35.933 --> 37:37.967
Well, I've been
living on Long Island...

37:38.067 --> 37:39.133
Oh?

37:39.233 --> 37:41.800
Yes, but I've got to make
some money now, Doctor.

37:41.900 --> 37:43.067
I'm sure we have
a cup somewhere...

37:43.133 --> 37:45.233
Oh, that's all right,
I've had my breakfast.

37:45.333 --> 37:46.667
Where?
Where?

37:46.767 --> 37:48.767
Yup.
Oh, in the automat.

37:48.867 --> 37:51.200
(CHUCKLING)
I'll use that one.

37:51.300 --> 37:53.100
I'd have I bet you'd
never been in an automat.

37:53.200 --> 37:57.067
Oh, I was!
Now look, Miss Eames, this
job only pays 25 a week.

37:57.133 --> 37:58.133
That's all right.

37:58.233 --> 38:00.900
Well, the work
isn't tough, but
the hours are long.

38:01.067 --> 38:02.600
I don't mind.

38:02.700 --> 38:05.167
I've seen you somewhere.

38:05.267 --> 38:06.867
Haven't been
in a hospital recently?

38:06.967 --> 38:08.067
No.

38:08.100 --> 38:09.733
You obviously
don't live down here.

38:09.833 --> 38:10.933
No.

38:11.067 --> 38:12.667
Do I look familiar?

38:12.767 --> 38:15.467
No.
Well, I must be wrong.

38:15.567 --> 38:18.067
Look, you've got
a little smudge on
your cheek right here.

38:18.133 --> 38:20.367
Oh, that's a beauty mark
over a mole.

38:20.467 --> 38:23.733
Well, why cover it up?
There's nothing wrong
with a mole.

38:23.833 --> 38:26.267
Miss Eames, can you
type and take dictation?

38:26.367 --> 38:28.967
Yes, I can type, some.

38:29.067 --> 38:30.267
I could brush up on it.

38:30.967 --> 38:32.367
Where?

38:32.467 --> 38:35.700
Well, I could go
to night school,
and study shorthand too.

38:35.800 --> 38:37.900
On 25 a week?

38:38.067 --> 38:39.600
Well, thank you
very much for
coming in, Miss...

38:39.700 --> 38:41.533
Dr. Quinada,
I need the job.

38:41.633 --> 38:43.400
So do many people.

38:43.500 --> 38:46.067
Please, Dr. Quinada,
I've been job hunting
for two weeks.

38:46.133 --> 38:48.200
I haven't got $25
to my name.

38:48.300 --> 38:50.733
Forgive me,
you don't look it.
But it's true.

38:53.600 --> 38:55.067
Honestly.

38:55.100 --> 38:57.267
The work isn't
very hard, you said
yourself it wasn't,

38:57.367 --> 38:59.467
and I can
answer telephones
and keep records.

38:59.567 --> 39:00.867
And type?
I'll practice...

39:00.967 --> 39:02.467
And take dictation?

39:02.567 --> 39:05.167
Well, if you didn't
speak too quickly I could
take it down in longhand.

39:05.267 --> 39:08.333
I write very fast
and I'm good with children.

39:08.433 --> 39:10.467
Yes, you are,
and that's important.

39:10.567 --> 39:12.333
And for 25 a week, well,

39:12.433 --> 39:14.933
I'm sure it's hard
to get somebody
who's really perfect.

39:17.967 --> 39:19.267
Well?

39:19.367 --> 39:20.800
I'll give you a try.

39:20.900 --> 39:22.333
Oh, thank you.

39:22.433 --> 39:23.700
Well, could
you start now,

39:23.800 --> 39:26.167
or would you like
to look around and
come in tomorrow, say?

39:26.267 --> 39:27.767
Well, I might as well.

39:27.867 --> 39:29.400
Start, I mean.
Okay.

39:29.500 --> 39:31.300
If that's all right with you.
Sure, that's fine.
I'll get Miss Murray

39:31.400 --> 39:32.500
to show you around.
I'll wait for her
out there.

39:32.600 --> 39:33.767
All right.

39:34.833 --> 39:37.600
Thank you very much.
Goodbye. I mean...

39:39.333 --> 39:40.567
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

39:40.667 --> 39:43.500
Good afternoon, Dr. Quinada
and Dr. Hoffman's office.

39:44.233 --> 39:45.800
Yes? Oh,
hello, Dr. Hoffman.

39:45.900 --> 39:47.267
Will you hold on, please?
Any calls, Le?

39:47.367 --> 39:50.833
Yes, there was one from...
Mrs. Palmer called,

39:50.933 --> 39:53.433
and Mrs. Burnstein's
in your office
with Miss Murray.

39:53.533 --> 39:55.267
Oh, thanks. Say, Le,

39:55.367 --> 39:57.167
would you mind
calling her Burnstein?

39:57.267 --> 39:59.167
She said she never knows
who you're talking about.

39:59.267 --> 40:01.433
Oh, I'm sorry, Doctor.
(LAUGHING)
It's no tragedy,

40:01.533 --> 40:04.500
these days, nobody knows
what anybody else's
talking about anyway.

40:04.600 --> 40:05.900
What a world.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.467
Well, Mrs. Burnstein,
seems like you're
looking fine today.

40:09.800 --> 40:12.200
Hello? Yes...
DR. QUINADA: If you worried
more about her stomach

40:12.300 --> 40:14.433
and less about this other
nonsense, the child
Yes, I will.

40:14.533 --> 40:16.233
Would be a great
deal better for it.
Now, you take her home,

40:16.333 --> 40:17.967
I don't want to hear
anymore about it.
Yes, Doctor, I will.

40:18.067 --> 40:20.900
Goodbye.
Come on, girl,
pick your feet up.

40:22.233 --> 40:23.433
DR. QUINADA: Now,
Mrs. Rudecki,

40:23.533 --> 40:25.933
don't forget to be back here
at 7:30 with your husband.

40:26.033 --> 40:27.633
Yes, doctor, I will.

40:27.733 --> 40:29.667
Some doctor he is!

40:29.767 --> 40:31.300
He's a very good doctor.

40:31.400 --> 40:32.933
I think you better
come in, Miss Eames.

40:33.033 --> 40:34.300
Yes, sir.

40:43.633 --> 40:46.167
Do you often chat
with Mrs. Rudecki
and the other mothers?

40:46.267 --> 40:48.300
No, not often.

40:48.400 --> 40:52.167
Did you suggest to
Mrs. Rudecki that she give
Lorraine elocution lessons?

40:52.833 --> 40:54.433
Yes.
Why?

40:54.533 --> 40:56.733
Well, Mr. Rudecki has
a thick foreign accent,

40:56.833 --> 40:58.133
and Mrs. Rudecki is
afraid that they might...

40:58.233 --> 40:59.867
Yes, I know all
about that, but wasn't
it some other reason,

41:00.067 --> 41:02.500
something about if
Lorraine learned to
speak well and walk well

41:02.600 --> 41:06.267
and do half a dozen
other things well, she'd
end up by marrying well

41:06.367 --> 41:08.700
and that that's
the most important
thing in a girl's life?

41:09.300 --> 41:10.633
Isn't that
what you said?

41:10.733 --> 41:12.867
Yes, I said that.
Now, look.

41:12.967 --> 41:15.267
Your beliefs are your
own business until you
start pumping them

41:15.367 --> 41:17.267
into my patients,
then they become
my business.

41:18.367 --> 41:20.333
Where did you
get these ideas anyway?

41:21.500 --> 41:24.100
Is it your burning
ambition to marry rich?

41:25.333 --> 41:26.733
Well, is it?

41:28.067 --> 41:31.400
(STAMMERING)
Is that all, Doctor?
No.

41:31.500 --> 41:33.833
Do you want this
job permanently?
Yes.

41:33.933 --> 41:36.800
Well, you act as though
it's a temporary
stopgap for you.

41:36.900 --> 41:40.633
Your typing, your filing,
all your desk work haven't
improved one iota

41:40.733 --> 41:43.133
in the two weeks
you've been here.

41:43.233 --> 41:46.200
I'm sorry.
Well, why don't you
do something about it?

41:46.300 --> 41:48.100
Now, I don't want
to irritate you
by bringing up

41:48.200 --> 41:49.833
your personal
standards again,

41:49.933 --> 41:53.067
but you're letting
them slop over
into your work, Leonora.

41:53.133 --> 41:56.400
You're a receptionist
in a doctor's officer
on the East Side,

41:56.500 --> 41:58.833
not a hostess
on Park Avenue.

41:58.933 --> 42:01.633
The way you treat your
patients, that way you...

42:01.733 --> 42:04.133
For Pete's sake,
look at that hairdo.

42:04.233 --> 42:07.633
You're so fancy,
you're scaring
people away.

42:07.733 --> 42:10.067
They may be poor,
but they're patients
and we want them.

42:10.133 --> 42:11.433
(TEARFULLY)
Well, you can keep them.

42:11.533 --> 42:14.100
If everything I do
is wrong, I might
as well quit.

42:15.100 --> 42:16.100
(DOOR CLOSES)

42:27.667 --> 42:28.867
Stupid.

42:33.733 --> 42:34.733
Stupid.

42:35.067 --> 42:36.067
What?

42:36.167 --> 42:37.733
She's a stupid girl.

42:37.833 --> 42:38.900
Who?

42:39.067 --> 42:41.800
I criticized her work
so she got mad and quit.

42:41.900 --> 42:43.067
Did she?

42:43.100 --> 42:44.733
Her work was bad.

42:45.067 --> 42:46.067
Was it?

42:46.133 --> 42:47.900
The point is, she
isn't really stupid.

42:48.067 --> 42:50.300
She could be quite good
if she wanted to be.

42:50.400 --> 42:52.800
Well, put the ad
in the paper again,

42:53.867 --> 42:55.900
unless you want to ask
her to come back.

42:56.067 --> 42:58.667
I didn't fire her,
she quit.

42:58.767 --> 43:01.633
I don't know
what's the matter
with that girl.

43:01.733 --> 43:04.333
You don't suppose
there's anything
the matter with you.

43:07.200 --> 43:08.567
Ridiculous.

43:13.367 --> 43:14.733
(KNOCKING)

43:14.833 --> 43:16.233
Yes, who is it?

43:17.533 --> 43:19.067
(KNOCKING)

43:19.467 --> 43:20.733
Just a minute.

43:20.833 --> 43:21.833
(SINGLE KNOCK)

43:30.767 --> 43:32.067
May I come in?

43:39.067 --> 43:40.600
May I sit down?

43:42.633 --> 43:45.533
How did... How did
you know I was here?

43:45.633 --> 43:47.967
I had you watched
from the day you left.

43:49.700 --> 43:51.967
I know I wouldn't
hear from you.

43:52.067 --> 43:54.300
I wanted to be sure
you were all right.

43:58.667 --> 44:02.100
It's not a very nice
way, but it's the
only way I knew.

44:03.633 --> 44:06.367
I guess everything turned
out as you predicted, Leonora.

44:09.067 --> 44:10.833
Can you hear me?

44:12.067 --> 44:13.300
Yes.

44:13.400 --> 44:17.233
I've missed you.
More than I thought
I could miss anyone.

44:26.067 --> 44:27.300
Thanks.

44:28.367 --> 44:30.367
I've come running
after you.

44:30.467 --> 44:32.733
To beg you to come
back to me.

44:33.800 --> 44:36.733
How's doctor...
What's his name,
Quinada?

44:37.200 --> 44:38.667
All right.

44:38.767 --> 44:40.167
He works you pretty hard,
doesn't he?

44:40.267 --> 44:42.067
Not as hard
as he works himself.

44:42.100 --> 44:45.233
Where does this go?
Any place.

44:45.333 --> 44:47.367
It's too bad he isn't
more successful then.

44:48.733 --> 44:50.833
He isn't just
interested in success.

44:53.100 --> 44:55.333
I'm sorry.
That wasn't fair.

44:56.333 --> 44:59.167
Truth is, I'm a little
jealous of him.

44:59.267 --> 45:02.867
You don't have any
reason to be, as much
as I wish you did.

45:04.767 --> 45:06.800
Why?

45:06.900 --> 45:10.900
Because I'm glad
to see you
and I wish I weren't.

45:15.300 --> 45:16.633
What are you looking for?

45:17.100 --> 45:18.433
A cigarette.

45:18.967 --> 45:20.367
I have one here.

45:26.267 --> 45:27.600
Leonora.

45:27.700 --> 45:29.500
It's no good, Smith.
I won't go back
to the way it was.

45:29.600 --> 45:32.067
I don't want you to.
I was wrong.
I admit it.

45:32.133 --> 45:34.300
No. Please, Smith, no.
It won't be that way
anymore, Leonora.

45:34.400 --> 45:35.567
It won't.

45:35.667 --> 45:37.600
We'll make a fresh start.

45:37.700 --> 45:41.167
We'll make everything
just the way it ought
to have been.

45:41.267 --> 45:43.433
I'm so used to having
my own way that...

45:44.233 --> 45:46.200
It was hard for me
to come here.

45:46.300 --> 45:49.400
But I missed you
and I wanted you
so much.

45:49.500 --> 45:52.833
I missed all the things
we ought to have done,
like, being together,

45:52.933 --> 45:56.533
finding new places,
having a honeymoon.

45:56.633 --> 45:59.567
Let's go and wander
more, Leonora.
Let's start over again.

46:01.367 --> 46:04.067
I can't see you
living in this
dirty, little room.

46:04.167 --> 46:05.567
It's not dirty, Smith.

46:05.667 --> 46:09.400
It's shabby.
It's awful.
Ragged.

46:09.500 --> 46:11.767
Let's get out
of here, Leonora.

46:11.867 --> 46:14.533
Well, I don't need anything.
We'll just take a drive
or have a cup of coffee.

46:14.633 --> 46:17.733
I don't care.
I just can't talk
in this room.

46:17.833 --> 46:19.900
I'll bring you back
the moment you ask me.

46:20.067 --> 46:22.100
Is that a promise?
Yes.

46:23.167 --> 46:24.833
Turn out the light.

46:28.867 --> 46:30.167
(CLICKING)

46:33.533 --> 46:35.667
Here?
No, the other side.

46:37.467 --> 46:39.700
You really don't
like living here.

46:39.800 --> 46:42.567
No one's poor
by choice.

46:42.667 --> 46:44.800
It really isn't such
a bad room.
(DOOR CLOSES)

46:44.900 --> 46:47.333
Not if you
haven't seen better.

46:55.300 --> 46:56.933
Darling, good morning.
Good morning, sir.

46:57.067 --> 46:58.700
Wait, may I relieve
you at this moment?
Oh, no.

46:58.800 --> 47:00.933
I would like to serve
breakfast myself today.
Oh, no.

47:01.067 --> 47:02.300
Just today.
I have a special reason.

47:02.400 --> 47:05.133
You can trust me.
I've done this before.
Believe me.

47:31.667 --> 47:33.400
(WHISTLING)

47:37.500 --> 47:39.067
Good morning, darling.

47:39.900 --> 47:41.233
Welcome home.

47:43.067 --> 47:44.700
What are you
doing here, Franzi?

47:44.800 --> 47:47.600
I know you would be
hungry so I brought
you a lovely breakfast.

47:47.700 --> 47:49.800
Three eggs, darling.

47:49.900 --> 47:52.367
I don't wanna get up yet.
But you must.

47:52.467 --> 47:54.067
Smith told me
to wake you.

47:55.133 --> 47:56.833
He did?
FRANZI: Yes.

47:56.933 --> 47:58.800
We leave in an hour.

47:58.900 --> 48:01.067
LEONORA: Who's we?
All of us, darling.

48:01.100 --> 48:03.500
Smith, Tim, Charlie,
me, the whole crowd.

48:04.800 --> 48:06.233
Where are we going?

48:06.333 --> 48:08.633
On a great tour of every
Ohlrig plant in the country.

48:09.133 --> 48:10.300
Publicity tour.

48:10.400 --> 48:12.767
FRANZI: It'll be a lovely
vacation and I
certainly need one.

48:12.867 --> 48:17.233
Franzi.
When did Smith decide
to make this trip?

48:17.333 --> 48:20.133
Day before yesterday.
You got back just in time.

48:20.233 --> 48:22.367
I always said you're
a smart little girl.

48:23.900 --> 48:26.333
This is a lovely suit
and cap and just take
this with your mink.

48:26.433 --> 48:28.467
Where is the mink?
They even buy...
(INAUDIBLE)

48:29.533 --> 48:32.400
I'm through
with that coat.
What?

48:32.500 --> 48:34.200
I'm through
with that coat.

48:34.300 --> 48:37.100
Darling, this is an
expensive thing.
You can't afford, I mean...

48:37.200 --> 48:40.467
I can.
Dr. Quinada's
office?

48:40.567 --> 48:42.667
Miss Murray,
this is Leonora Eames.

48:44.067 --> 48:45.400
I'll wait.

48:45.500 --> 48:48.467
Don't be stupid, Leonora.
Take this away, please.

48:48.567 --> 48:51.067
Look I told you,
all these once before.
Take it.

48:51.133 --> 48:52.400
Darling, be a darling.

48:52.500 --> 48:54.067
All right.
All right.

48:55.333 --> 48:57.833
Some darlings never know
when they are well-off.

48:57.933 --> 49:00.800
No, but give
them time, Franzi,
and they'll find out.

49:01.567 --> 49:03.467
Dr. Quinada?

49:03.567 --> 49:06.500
I'm very sorry
about yesterday
and I was wondering...

49:07.633 --> 49:10.167
Yes, I'd like to come
back very much.

49:11.400 --> 49:13.600
Yes, I'll be there
as soon as I can.

49:34.333 --> 49:36.533
Come on.
Come on, Le, go home.
Beat it.

49:36.633 --> 49:37.867
Here, for tomorrow
morning.

49:37.967 --> 49:40.200
I wanna finish
sending these out,
the monthly bills.

49:40.300 --> 49:43.067
Oh, why bother.
Nobody ever pays
the doctor, anyway.

49:43.100 --> 49:45.133
(CHUCKLING)
Has Quinada left?

49:45.233 --> 49:47.333
Uh-uh.
He hasn't come back
from the clinic yet.

49:47.433 --> 49:49.633
Well, if he doesn't show
up by 9:00, you know
how to lock out.

49:49.733 --> 49:51.833
Sure. Goodnight.
Goodnight, Le.

49:51.933 --> 49:53.100
Uh...

49:53.200 --> 49:55.233
Don't wait later
than 9:30, anyway.

49:55.333 --> 49:56.967
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

49:57.067 --> 49:58.633
(PHONE RINGING)

50:00.200 --> 50:01.733
Dr. Quinada's office.

50:02.467 --> 50:05.200
No, not yet,
Mrs. Rudecki.

50:05.300 --> 50:06.933
Yes, I did tell him, but...

50:08.000 --> 50:09.733
Yes, I'll tell him again,
Mrs. Rudecki.

50:10.167 --> 50:11.333
LEONORA: Yes.

50:12.933 --> 50:14.400
Hello.
LEONORA: Hi.

50:16.400 --> 50:19.133
LEONORA: Tired?
Beat.

50:19.233 --> 50:21.667
Is this becoming
a habit?
Staying overtime?

50:22.967 --> 50:24.633
Coffee will be ready
in a minute.

50:27.300 --> 50:28.900
Take your coat off.

50:31.667 --> 50:34.767
Mrs. Rudecki phoned
again for you
to come over.

50:34.867 --> 50:39.100
I told her this morning
there was no sense
in my coming over.

50:39.200 --> 50:42.600
Well, this is the 10th time
she's called which
is a new record for her.

50:42.700 --> 50:44.067
You know what
I'd like to do
with Lorraine

50:44.167 --> 50:46.600
next time she comes
into this office?

50:46.700 --> 50:49.433
Cut off those
awful curls.

50:49.533 --> 50:52.433
And you know how
she could cure that
stomach trouble of hers?

50:52.533 --> 50:54.900
By sending her mother
to a good psychiatrist.

50:55.600 --> 50:57.000
Any temperature?

50:57.100 --> 51:00.700
No. She says it's normal,
but she claims
Lorraine's seeing double.

51:03.200 --> 51:05.667
Seeing double?
LEONORA: Yes.

51:13.967 --> 51:17.200
Miss Murray's gone,
isn't she?
LEONORA: Yes.

51:17.300 --> 51:21.600
Le, grab a taxi
and get over
to the City Drugstore.

51:21.700 --> 51:23.067
Okay.
You know where it is?

51:23.167 --> 51:25.467
Yeah, I'll find it.
You have some money,
haven't you?

51:25.567 --> 51:26.600
(CHUCKLING)
Sure.

51:32.400 --> 51:34.867
Have this filled
and look me up at
the Rudecki's right away.

51:34.967 --> 51:36.100
Okay.

51:37.567 --> 51:39.233
And hurry.
Yeah.

51:48.500 --> 51:50.633
(MOANING)

51:55.467 --> 51:57.733
That light's a little
bright for her eyes.

51:57.833 --> 51:59.667
Find something
to shade it with.

52:10.467 --> 52:13.267
I'm afraid
it's botulism.
Botulism?

52:13.367 --> 52:16.500
Yeah, that's a doctor's
fancy word for a very
bad kind of food poisoning.

52:16.600 --> 52:19.267
(SPEAKING POLISH)

52:19.367 --> 52:21.300

(SPEAKING POLISH)

52:23.967 --> 52:25.333
Mama means...

52:26.067 --> 52:27.367
Will she get all right?

52:28.767 --> 52:31.933
I don't know.
I think so, but
I don't know for sure.

52:32.067 --> 52:33.700
You're so busy telling
me I'm sick,

52:33.800 --> 52:35.433
but you haven't
got time to come
and see for yourself.

52:35.533 --> 52:36.733
Can you just
keep quiet, please?

52:36.833 --> 52:38.733
That canned meat that
she had this morning

52:38.833 --> 52:40.067
must have been
the cause of the trouble.

52:40.133 --> 52:41.133
Anyone else eat it?

52:41.233 --> 52:42.433
(SPEAKING POLISH)

52:42.533 --> 52:45.067
No.
Is there any left?

52:45.167 --> 52:46.733
Kitchen window.

52:50.867 --> 52:52.900
Why did you open
the can, you fool?

52:53.067 --> 52:54.500
You were not
supposed to open.

52:54.600 --> 52:56.533
(ARGUING)

53:02.067 --> 53:05.333
I'll give her another
injection every six hours
until it takes effect.

53:09.500 --> 53:12.567
If it takes effect.
It will.

53:12.667 --> 53:15.167
Even when you
treat cases like
this immediately,

53:15.267 --> 53:17.900
18% of those treated die.

53:18.067 --> 53:21.167
I know all the statistics.
I'm a very good
textbook doctor.

53:21.267 --> 53:22.767
What's the matter, Quinada?

53:22.867 --> 53:24.200
I slipped up.

53:24.300 --> 53:26.200
Just because Lorraine's
always had stomach trouble,

53:26.300 --> 53:27.833
I assumed that's what
it was this time.

53:27.933 --> 53:29.667
A doctor has no
right to assume.

53:29.767 --> 53:31.233
Anyone can make
a mistake.

53:31.333 --> 53:33.200
Not when it comes
to a kid's life.

53:33.300 --> 53:36.067
I should have come
straight over this morning
instead of being such a...

53:37.200 --> 53:38.800
What are you doing?

53:38.900 --> 53:43.067
Well, you were shouting
a little and I didn't want
the Rudecki's to hear it.

53:44.200 --> 53:45.700
Good idea.

53:45.800 --> 53:49.067
You know, you might
just as well go home.
It's after 1:00.

53:49.667 --> 53:51.333
No, no, I'll stay.

53:52.067 --> 53:53.500
Okay.

53:55.433 --> 53:57.067
LARRY: Well, I'll be back
here about noon.

53:57.133 --> 53:58.700
To give her another
injection, all right?

53:58.800 --> 54:01.400
Thank you, doctor.
Thank you.
Thank you, doctor.

54:05.100 --> 54:07.700
Sleepy?
Uh-uh, not a bit.

54:07.800 --> 54:09.767
I'm used to staying
up all night.

54:10.867 --> 54:12.833
LARRY: You wait
'til about 9:00.

54:13.633 --> 54:15.467
That's when it
catches up on you.

54:17.067 --> 54:19.600
Aren't you cold?
No.

54:19.700 --> 54:22.567
Why did you wear
that ridiculous coat?
Don't you wanna be warm?

54:22.667 --> 54:25.567
I thought it was going
to rain yesterday.
You must be freezing.

54:27.067 --> 54:29.433
How much would it cost
to buy you a warm coat?

54:29.533 --> 54:30.933
Oh, no, please.

54:31.067 --> 54:33.233
Now, look, Rudecki
has just paid me
for the last two months.

54:33.333 --> 54:35.367
I don't need
an overcoat.
I got one.

54:35.467 --> 54:37.233
Oh, it's very nice
of you but...

54:38.233 --> 54:40.100
All right.

54:40.200 --> 54:42.100
You go home
and get some sleep.

54:42.200 --> 54:45.733
I'm going home to take
a bath, but I'm coming
back to work.

54:45.833 --> 54:48.133
What do you think I am,
a Park Avenue hostess?

54:49.267 --> 54:50.767
No, not a bit.

55:50.200 --> 55:51.833
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

55:51.933 --> 55:53.800
Good morning, Le.
Good morning.

55:53.900 --> 55:55.500
Don't you ever go home?

56:06.200 --> 56:07.367
DR. HOFFMAN: Come in.

56:18.200 --> 56:20.167
DR. HOFFMAN: It's really
too early to be sure.

56:20.267 --> 56:21.400
LEONORA: I know.

56:23.967 --> 56:26.933
DR. HOFFMAN: Are you worried?
(CHUCKLING)
That's a silly question.

56:29.300 --> 56:31.767
How long will
a lab report take?

56:31.867 --> 56:34.867
Well, if you went over
there now yourself,
(SIGHING)

56:34.967 --> 56:37.400
they'd probably
let you know first thing
tomorrow morning.

56:37.833 --> 56:39.567
Can I just go?

56:39.667 --> 56:42.300
I'll call and tell them
you're coming if you like.
Please.

56:50.533 --> 56:51.600
I...

56:52.800 --> 56:54.367
You won't say anything.

56:54.467 --> 56:56.700
To Quinada?
Yes.

56:57.567 --> 56:59.367
No.
(CHUCKLING)

56:59.467 --> 57:02.967
It's none of my
business, Le, but don't
you think that you should?

57:06.067 --> 57:07.600
I...
I couldn't.

57:07.700 --> 57:09.600
DR. HOFFMAN: He's really
a marvelous fellow.

57:11.067 --> 57:12.600
I know, but...

57:13.800 --> 57:15.100
It's too much of a mess.

57:16.067 --> 57:17.200
DR. HOFFMAN: Okay.

57:19.067 --> 57:20.500
Anyway, thanks.

57:25.433 --> 57:27.433
MISS MURRAY: I must say
you don't look it.

57:27.533 --> 57:28.933
Look what?

57:29.833 --> 57:31.367
Well, you've been up
all night.

57:31.467 --> 57:33.967
Mrs. Rudecki just
phoned and told me
about the seizure.

57:34.067 --> 57:36.400
Good morning, Doctor.
Good morning,
Miss Murray.

57:36.500 --> 57:38.533
Good morning.
Good morning.

57:38.633 --> 57:40.433
Good morning,
Mrs...

57:42.167 --> 57:44.267
Where are you going?

57:44.367 --> 57:47.533
I think I better get some
sleep. It's catching
up with me.

57:53.100 --> 57:54.267
Le?

58:00.067 --> 58:02.100
I know you'd
rather freeze, but...

58:04.067 --> 58:05.633
Will you try it on?

58:07.233 --> 58:10.167
It's not mink, but
it will keep you warm.
That's the main thing.

58:11.233 --> 58:12.367
It fits.

58:13.833 --> 58:16.333
It doesn't look bad.
Turn around.
Let's see the front.

58:20.300 --> 58:21.833
Now, Leonora.

58:21.933 --> 58:23.333
(SNIFFLING)

58:23.433 --> 58:24.633
Don't do that.

58:25.733 --> 58:26.967
I'm sorry.

58:27.933 --> 58:29.267
Thank you.

We still have
our date tonight?

(CLAPPING)

58:55.633 --> 58:58.100
(PIANO PLAYING)

58:59.067 --> 59:01.067
I was mad at you
that day.

59:02.700 --> 59:05.667
Did I ever apologize
for bawling you
out so badly?

59:05.767 --> 59:08.200
And what made
you think of that?

59:08.300 --> 59:12.300
Was that because
of the way I talked
about marrying rich?

59:12.400 --> 59:15.600
It always makes me
see red when
people talk that way.

59:15.700 --> 59:18.067
My parents
made themselves
absolutely miserable

by having an exaggerated
idea about the importance
of money.

59:21.200 --> 59:23.367
Got a light, sweetie?
Sure.

59:25.900 --> 59:28.900
By the time I came along,
they'd lost most of it.

59:29.067 --> 59:30.700
Muchas Gracias.

59:31.800 --> 59:35.167
Your hair looks
good that way.
Thank you.

59:35.267 --> 59:36.733
You look very lovely.

59:38.233 --> 59:40.067
Is something
worrying you?

59:40.100 --> 59:42.633
No, I'm very happy.

59:42.733 --> 59:44.567
Go on about your parents.

59:44.667 --> 59:49.133
Oh, they just wasted
their lives pretending
to be rich,

59:49.233 --> 59:53.333
conniving and finagling,
never working, of course.

59:54.133 --> 59:57.167
Thanks, sweetie.
Oh, thank you.

59:57.267 --> 01:00:00.333
This isn't mine.
What?
Don't you want it?

01:00:00.433 --> 01:00:03.667
No, thank you.
Well, muchas gracias.

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:09.400
I can't imagine you
pretending to be rich
or pretending anything.

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:12.400
Oh, I did for a while
until I pulled out of it.

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:14.733
Two more, sir?
No, we're fine.
Thank you.

01:00:14.833 --> 01:00:16.933
Unless...
Oh, no.
Thank you.

01:00:18.267 --> 01:00:22.400
Larry, was it
very difficult?
No.

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:24.867
That's because you
don't care about money.

01:00:24.967 --> 01:00:27.533
One has got to care
about money
to a certain extent.

01:00:27.633 --> 01:00:30.500
How else could I take
you out to the dinner
when I want to?

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:33.400
Well, I care more
about others things
like...

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:36.233
Doing the kind of work
that interests me.

01:00:36.333 --> 01:00:38.833
Is that why you work
in the East Side?
Sure.

01:00:38.933 --> 01:00:40.933
I can learn more
of there in one day

01:00:41.033 --> 01:00:42.867
than I can learn any
place else in a month.

01:00:42.967 --> 01:00:46.400
All right, sweetie.
Let's go.
I beg your pardon?

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:50.433
What?
Perfectly okay.

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:53.700
Buenas noches.
Buenas noches.

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.300
(CHUCKLING)

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:58.733
That's a wonderful
smile you've got.
Charming.

01:00:58.833 --> 01:01:00.267
What?

01:01:00.367 --> 01:01:03.333
Nothing.
I was just remembering
something.

01:01:03.433 --> 01:01:06.100
I wish I could remember
where I saw you before.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:07.800
I don't think
you ever did.

01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:10.067
Didn't you ever
come into town
from Long Island?

01:01:10.167 --> 01:01:11.967
No.
Hardly ever.

01:01:12.067 --> 01:01:14.067
What were you
doing there?

01:01:14.167 --> 01:01:18.767
Oh, I was sort of a paid
companion to somebody
who was very rich.

01:01:20.133 --> 01:01:23.067
Let's dance.
All right.
I'm not very good.

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:25.167
Oh, we don't have to.
Oh, I'd like to
if you would.

01:01:25.267 --> 01:01:27.200
I haven't danced in ages.
Perhaps, you'd rather not.

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:28.667
No, not unless
you would.

01:01:28.767 --> 01:01:30.867
Well, I'm just as happy
sitting here, but I just...
Oh, so am I.

01:01:30.967 --> 01:01:33.167
Oh, come on.
Let's dance.
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

01:01:53.233 --> 01:01:55.767
Oh, I'm sorry.
I stepped on your foot.
You didn't.

01:01:55.867 --> 01:01:59.567
(GIGGLING)
Good. It's probably
somebody else's.

01:01:59.667 --> 01:02:03.067
This public dancing
is quite an invention.
You can get away with murder.

01:02:03.133 --> 01:02:04.467
(GIGGLING)

01:02:14.667 --> 01:02:17.100
I'm having
a wonderful time.
(CHUCKLING)

01:02:18.467 --> 01:02:20.767
Oops.
(LAUGHING)

01:02:24.433 --> 01:02:26.567
We ought to have
done this ages ago.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:36.900
Why don't we go out
again on Saturday?

01:02:37.067 --> 01:02:38.800
And then spend
Sunday together?

01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:40.933
And Monday too.
Sure.

01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:43.433
And Tuesday.

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:03.733
And we can go dancing
again Saturday night.

01:03:05.633 --> 01:03:08.467
And then spend
Sunday again.

01:03:08.567 --> 01:03:10.867
You know, it would be
much simpler
if we were married

01:03:12.233 --> 01:03:14.667
and we wouldn't
have to make dates.

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.767
Did you hear
what I said?
Yes.

01:03:20.867 --> 01:03:24.100
I was proposing.
You weren't.

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:25.633
Sure.
Why not?

01:03:26.467 --> 01:03:28.867
Larry, I...

01:03:28.967 --> 01:03:32.300
I want to marry you
more than anything
in the world but...

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:34.933
But?

01:03:35.067 --> 01:03:38.200
Well, there's something
I have to straighten
out first.

01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:41.533
Let's not talk about it.
Okay.

01:03:42.567 --> 01:03:44.467
I'll propose again
tomorrow.

01:03:58.200 --> 01:03:59.667
LARRY: What's new?

01:03:59.767 --> 01:04:03.733
Brought in a nine-pounder
this afternoon. Boy.

01:04:03.833 --> 01:04:05.200
LARRY: Congratulations.

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.233
It was a madhouse today.

01:04:08.333 --> 01:04:09.467
DR. HOFFMAN: A rat race.

01:04:09.567 --> 01:04:12.233
LARRY: Mrs. Cricket at the bar
swallowed a dime.

01:04:12.333 --> 01:04:13.967
DR. HOFFMAN: (CHUCKLING)

01:04:14.067 --> 01:04:16.067
No news from Leonora.

01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:17.933
DR. HOFFMAN: Well, maybe
she isn't feeling well.

01:04:18.067 --> 01:04:19.567
She'll be back tomorrow.

01:04:19.667 --> 01:04:22.167
Yeah, I dropped by her place
on the way from hospital.
She's moved.

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:23.567
Gone.

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.600
Where to?

01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:28.300
Long Island,
the landlady said.
(PIPE CLANKING)

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:29.867
You know, there's pipes
are on the brink again.

01:04:29.967 --> 01:04:31.400
We ought to send
for the plumber.

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.133
What's the matter
with the landlord?

01:04:33.233 --> 01:04:35.167
Ah, they'll never
catch him.

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:38.300
I was out with her last night.

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:40.300
Well, didn't she
say anything?

01:04:41.167 --> 01:04:43.067
About leaving?
No.

01:04:44.133 --> 01:04:46.267
You didn't criticize
her again?

01:04:46.367 --> 01:04:47.967
No.
(CHUCKLING)

01:04:48.067 --> 01:04:50.100
I proposed to her
as matter of fact.

01:04:54.233 --> 01:04:56.333
I thought I'd run out
to Long Island.

01:04:57.067 --> 01:04:58.533
Oh.

01:04:58.633 --> 01:05:02.167
Well, Larry, was last night
the first time you went
out with her?

01:05:03.667 --> 01:05:04.900
Yes.

01:05:05.067 --> 01:05:06.900
Long Island?

01:05:07.067 --> 01:05:09.700
Hmm...
I don't know.

01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:13.900
I ended up pretty
silly anyway.

01:05:14.067 --> 01:05:18.067
All I can get out of her
was that she was
a paid companion

01:05:18.133 --> 01:05:19.700
to somebody rich.

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:22.833
(CHUCKLING)
Nice work if you
can get it.

01:05:22.933 --> 01:05:25.667
(CHUCKLING)
I can just hear
the conversation.

01:05:25.767 --> 01:05:29.267
"Good evening,
Mr. so and so.
I'm Dr. Quinada."

01:05:29.367 --> 01:05:32.700
"Are you by any chance
keeping one of my
former employees,."

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:35.200
"A Miss Leonora Eames?"

01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:37.200
(CHUCKLING)
Yeah. Yeah.

01:05:37.733 --> 01:05:39.533
Well...

01:05:39.633 --> 01:05:42.567
Why don't you
forget her?

01:05:42.667 --> 01:05:43.867
LARRY: You think so?

01:05:44.367 --> 01:05:45.500
Well, yeah.

01:05:46.233 --> 01:05:47.567
LARRY: All right.

01:05:48.933 --> 01:05:52.500
Good night.
DR. HOFFMAN: Good night,
Larry.

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:53.933
MAN: Well, it adds
up to be nothing more
Yes?

01:05:54.067 --> 01:05:57.067
Than a windy
analysis which, uh...
I'll tell him.

01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:59.633
SMITH: Which shows absolutely
no conception of the problem

01:05:59.733 --> 01:06:01.500
in plain terms
of dollars and cents.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:04.067
As to paragraph four,
this too is completely
ridiculous.

01:06:04.167 --> 01:06:05.867
Yes.
If you want me
to invest one penny...

01:06:05.967 --> 01:06:07.067
Who was that?

01:06:07.167 --> 01:06:10.433
Dr. Quinada is calling
to see Miss Eames.
Who?

01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:12.067
Miss Eames?

01:06:12.167 --> 01:06:14.867
I'll get rid of him,
darling.
Get rid of yourself.

01:06:14.967 --> 01:06:17.233
Send him in.
Of course, darling.

01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:22.200
If you want me
to invest one penny,

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:24.500
you will do it my way
or not at all.

01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:27.367
Sincerely yours.

01:06:27.467 --> 01:06:30.433
That's all, gentlemen.
Good night.
Good night.

01:06:30.533 --> 01:06:32.967
Good night, Mr. Ohlrig.
Good night,
Mr. Ohlrig.

01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:38.100
(CLOCK CHIMING)

01:06:41.633 --> 01:06:42.767
(DOOR CLOSES)

01:06:55.533 --> 01:06:57.133
FRANZI: In here, please.

01:07:02.433 --> 01:07:03.567
Good evening.

01:07:11.067 --> 01:07:14.067
I'm Smith Ohlrig.
Would you like a drink?

01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:15.167
Thank you.

01:07:19.067 --> 01:07:22.333
Is Miss Eames here?
She'll be right down.
Champagne?

01:07:22.433 --> 01:07:24.233
I'd rather have
something else
if you don't mind.

01:07:24.333 --> 01:07:26.067
Scotch?
That'll be fine.

01:07:27.367 --> 01:07:30.600
I might have known
you'd be good-looking.

01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:32.667
Leonora was very
impressed with you.

01:07:32.767 --> 01:07:34.967
I was very much
impressed with her.

01:07:35.067 --> 01:07:38.133
She started from scratch
and learned to a good
job very quickly.

01:07:39.533 --> 01:07:41.500
Soda?
Plain water, please.

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:44.700
Also, she's very
attractive.
That always helps.

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:46.100
Yes, it does.

01:07:47.733 --> 01:07:51.267
I'm glad you and Leonora
are hitting it off
so well together.

01:07:51.367 --> 01:07:53.667
There's nothing
like a little extra
curricular romance

01:07:53.767 --> 01:07:55.833
after office hours,
is there, Doctor?

01:07:55.933 --> 01:07:58.367
It's hardly any business
of yours, Mr. Ohlrig.

01:07:58.467 --> 01:08:01.967
Just interested
in employer-employee
relationships.

01:08:02.067 --> 01:08:05.100
After all, Leonora
was an employee of mine.

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:06.800
In a way, she still is.

01:08:07.367 --> 01:08:08.533
How do you mean?

01:08:08.633 --> 01:08:09.900
We're still married.

01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:22.966
I always had a curious
feeling that I'd seen
Leonora before.

01:08:23.899 --> 01:08:25.233
Now I know where.

01:08:26.399 --> 01:08:28.100
In the newspapers.

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:31.067
A picture, right after
your wedding.

01:08:35.233 --> 01:08:37.167
I better go.
I'm afraid I've
made a mistake.

01:08:37.267 --> 01:08:38.700
I'm afraid you have.

01:09:02.067 --> 01:09:03.367
Thank you.

01:09:05.867 --> 01:09:07.067
(WHISPERING)
Larry!

01:09:08.133 --> 01:09:10.067
Larry, meet
me outside.

01:09:10.832 --> 01:09:11.800
Where?

01:09:11.899 --> 01:09:13.767
In the garden
around the side.

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:15.400
(DOOR OPENING)

01:10:16.233 --> 01:10:17.633
Larry!

01:10:25.667 --> 01:10:27.267
Why didn't you say
anything to me?

01:10:27.367 --> 01:10:28.533
How could you run
away like a child?

01:10:28.633 --> 01:10:29.900
I tried to tell
you, Larry.
When?

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.167
Well, the very
first day, but I wanted
the job and I...

01:10:33.267 --> 01:10:35.900
How could you sit
at that bar with me
and you say nothing?

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.433
(STUTTERING)
I just couldn't.

01:10:37.533 --> 01:10:38.867
Did you know you were
gonna go back to him?

01:10:38.967 --> 01:10:41.200
No, not then.
What you made
you do it?

01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:43.467
I had to.
You said you loved me.

01:10:43.567 --> 01:10:45.500
I do. I...
Then what is it?

01:10:46.667 --> 01:10:48.300
Are you afraid of him?

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:51.300
No, I...
Then what?
Tell me.

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:52.933
I'm going to have a baby.

01:11:01.267 --> 01:11:03.700
Le, listen.
Forget that I love you.

01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:05.267
Larry...
No, no, I mean it.

01:11:05.367 --> 01:11:08.133
Forget that I want you,
that I want to marry you.
But believe this.

01:11:08.233 --> 01:11:10.100
You can't stay here.
You got to leave him.

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.667
I can't.
I'm not saying this just
because of how I feel.

01:11:12.767 --> 01:11:14.800
I was with that man
for three minutes.

01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:16.933
But I know
he's not normal.
He's dangerous.

01:11:17.067 --> 01:11:18.200
You've got to get
out of here.

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:20.067
Larry, it's his baby.

01:11:20.133 --> 01:11:23.067
So because of convention,
you'll let him destroy
you and your child?

01:11:23.167 --> 01:11:24.333
No, I won't let him.

01:11:24.433 --> 01:11:27.233
You will help.
Without meaning to,
you'll help!

01:11:27.333 --> 01:11:29.667
You sat in my office
too many times
not to know

01:11:29.767 --> 01:11:31.567
what happens to a child
whose parents
are messed up.

01:11:31.667 --> 01:11:34.667
But I know what happens
to a child whose parents
haven't got anything.

01:11:34.767 --> 01:11:36.067
That's why you came
back to him, isn't it?

01:11:36.133 --> 01:11:39.267
No, I came back
for my baby, for his future.
I want security.

01:11:39.367 --> 01:11:41.500
You want money.
Isn't that why
you married him?

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:42.967
No, no.
For security?

01:11:43.067 --> 01:11:45.067
I thought I loved him.
You mean you made
yourself think that.

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:46.233
(SIGHING)
Don't.

01:11:46.333 --> 01:11:47.767
You found out it
was wrong to marry
just for money,

01:11:47.867 --> 01:11:50.333
so you had
to make yourself...
No.

01:11:50.433 --> 01:11:54.400
You still got those
same ridiculous ideas.
Marry rich, live rich.

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.667
I didn't know
what to do.
You know what you want.

01:11:56.767 --> 01:11:57.867
Yes, I want you, but I...

01:11:57.967 --> 01:11:59.500
But you want your
child to be rich.

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:01.367
Well, make up
your mind, Leonora.

01:12:01.467 --> 01:12:02.967
I'd be the last man
to say that anyone

01:12:03.067 --> 01:12:04.667
can be secure without
money in this world,

01:12:04.767 --> 01:12:06.233
but money alone
isn't security,

01:12:06.333 --> 01:12:08.067
as you ought to know
it by now.

01:12:08.133 --> 01:12:10.467
What should I do?
Tell me.
Grow up!

01:12:10.567 --> 01:12:13.433
If you're still gonna
be wishing for mink coats
and houses like this...

01:12:13.533 --> 01:12:15.067
I don't want you.
(CLICKING)

01:12:21.433 --> 01:12:24.067
Trying to recapture
the feeling of
the East Side, Leonora?

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:25.233
Smith, we were...

01:12:25.333 --> 01:12:27.967
I understood you
were such a moral
character, Doctor.

01:12:28.067 --> 01:12:30.733
Not the type to make
passes at somebody
else's wife.

01:12:30.833 --> 01:12:32.267
Of course, Leonora
doesn't surprise me.

01:12:32.367 --> 01:12:33.467
That's about enough!

01:12:33.567 --> 01:12:34.600
Now, look...

01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:37.233
And stop clenching
your fists.

01:12:37.333 --> 01:12:39.333
I would be only
too glad to take
a crack at you

01:12:39.433 --> 01:12:41.067
but it wouldn't
settle a thing.

01:12:43.333 --> 01:12:46.067
The only one of us who can
settle this is Leonora.

01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:47.367
Smith, Larry was...
Don't try to act...

01:12:47.467 --> 01:12:49.267
I'll tell you exactly
what's been going
on, Ohlrig.

01:12:49.367 --> 01:12:51.733
I told Leonora that
I love her and I want
to marry her.

01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:55.800
Did you bother
to tell him
about the child?

01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:57.700
LARRY: Yes, and I warned
her that you'll ruin it.

01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:59.400
You take a lot
for granted.
LARRY: Nothing.

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:01.333
I don't even want
Leonora until she decides

01:13:01.433 --> 01:13:03.900
how important money
really is to her.

01:13:04.067 --> 01:13:05.100
SMITH: Oh, I can answer
that without even...

01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:07.333
It's not your answer
I'm interested in!
It's hers.

01:13:14.367 --> 01:13:16.633
If you make up
your mind,
you can always call.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:52.267
Whose child
are you having?

01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:56.900
From the moment
I came back,
I've had to listen

01:13:57.067 --> 01:14:00.500
to your filthy
insinuations.
Well not anymore.

01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:04.067
Come down here, Leonora.
I said come down here.

01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:06.433
You came back to get
a divorce, didn't you?

01:14:06.533 --> 01:14:11.367
You wanted to divorce me
and live happily ever after
with him on my money.

01:14:11.467 --> 01:14:13.267
I don't want your money.

01:14:13.367 --> 01:14:15.067
But you do wanna
leave me, don't you?

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:17.200
Yes.

01:14:19.233 --> 01:14:21.067
We're all wrong
together, Smith.

01:14:23.833 --> 01:14:25.800
It's been a mistake
from the beginning.

01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:30.233
You can have a divorce
on one condition.

01:14:31.167 --> 01:14:32.400
Come down here.

01:14:38.933 --> 01:14:41.567
You know, Leonora,
you still walk like a model.

01:14:41.667 --> 01:14:43.400
And not a very
good one at that.

01:14:44.767 --> 01:14:46.900
Are you in love with
your doctor friend?
Smith.

01:14:47.067 --> 01:14:48.800
You are, aren't you?
What does...

01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:50.567
Admit it.

01:14:50.667 --> 01:14:52.433
Do you care whether
I am or not?

01:14:52.533 --> 01:14:54.300
Yes, I want you
to be in love with him.

01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:56.500
Why?

01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:59.267
Because then it's easier
for me to win.

01:14:59.367 --> 01:15:01.700
Win what?
What is it you
want, Smith?

01:15:03.667 --> 01:15:07.200
You can have your divorce,
but I get the child.
That's the condition.

01:15:08.733 --> 01:15:11.733
You know I wouldn't
do that!
Of course I do.

01:15:11.833 --> 01:15:14.733
I also know I can get
custody of the child
anytime I want.

01:15:17.167 --> 01:15:18.667
How?

01:15:18.767 --> 01:15:22.233
By suing you
for divorce and naming
Quinada correspondent.

01:15:22.333 --> 01:15:25.400
But we haven't done
anything wrong.

01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:27.400
If you have money,
you could always
get enough people

01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:29.067
to swear to anything
you want.

01:15:32.133 --> 01:15:33.567
You wouldn't!

01:15:33.667 --> 01:15:36.567
Oh, yes, I would.
And what's more, I will.

01:15:36.667 --> 01:15:39.733
If you ever so much
as talk to him
on the phone.

01:15:39.833 --> 01:15:43.133
You once told me
you thought I was sorry
from the moment we married.

01:15:43.233 --> 01:15:44.567
That's pretty mild.

01:15:44.667 --> 01:15:47.267
I hated myself
for being such a fool.

01:15:47.367 --> 01:15:49.333
I never wanted you
in the first place.

01:15:49.433 --> 01:15:51.900
The more you fought me,
the more I began
to dislike you.

01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:54.733
I think now I hate you.

01:15:54.833 --> 01:15:56.433
All I care about
is breaking you.

01:15:56.533 --> 01:15:59.067
And if I have
to use the child
to do it, I will.

01:15:59.133 --> 01:16:01.767
You know enough
about me to know
that I can't stand losing.

01:16:01.867 --> 01:16:05.067
Only nice people lose
and you're obviously
a nice girl.

01:16:05.167 --> 01:16:07.300
All you came back
for is that child.

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:09.200
And as long as you
want it, you're stuck here.

01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:11.300
And that's probably
for the rest of your life!

01:16:12.367 --> 01:16:15.067
Smith.
Smith, wait!

01:16:15.133 --> 01:16:17.633
Wait, Smith.
Smith!

01:16:17.733 --> 01:16:20.867
Oh, Smith, you don't mean it.
You're just angry with me.
(CRYING)

01:16:20.967 --> 01:16:24.867
LEONORA: Smith, listen,
please let me have my baby.

01:16:24.967 --> 01:16:27.433
Don't take my baby,
Smith, don't!

01:16:27.533 --> 01:16:29.200
LEONORA: Oh, Smith!
(RINGING)

01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:31.300
(CRYING)
Oh, Smith.

01:17:10.367 --> 01:17:12.133
FRANZI: "From the way
that multimillionaire"

01:17:12.233 --> 01:17:14.833
"has been treating
his car hop wife
the last three months,"

01:17:14.933 --> 01:17:18.667
"we understand she is ready
to call the Long Island
estate, Wit's End."

01:17:18.767 --> 01:17:20.433
"Ha! Ha!"

01:17:20.533 --> 01:17:22.567
I can't even get her
on the phone.

01:17:32.167 --> 01:17:34.100
Tell Leonora
I wanna see her.

01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:35.300
Smith, it's so late.

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:38.067
Tell Leonora
I wanna see her!
Right now.

01:17:56.833 --> 01:17:58.933
(CLICKING)

01:18:03.133 --> 01:18:05.067
(CLICKING)

01:18:27.833 --> 01:18:29.933
(MOANING)

01:18:32.433 --> 01:18:33.733
(KNOCKING)

01:18:34.333 --> 01:18:35.700
FRANZI: Leonora.

01:18:36.567 --> 01:18:38.467
(KNOCKING)

01:18:38.567 --> 01:18:40.600
FRANZI: Leonora, I know
you're awake.

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:44.367
Leonora.
(KNOCKING)

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:52.333
Leonora, he's in a rage.
He'll come up himself.
You know that.

01:18:52.433 --> 01:18:54.067
(KNOCKING)

01:18:55.333 --> 01:18:56.867
FRANZI: Leonora!

01:19:02.067 --> 01:19:04.633
It's really plain, darling.
Why you didn't answer
the phone when he called?

01:19:04.733 --> 01:19:07.067
He's in a terrible rage.
I didn't hear.

01:19:07.133 --> 01:19:09.533
He let it ring for five
minutes by the clock
and he was in a conference.

01:19:09.633 --> 01:19:11.067
I pulled it out.

01:19:11.167 --> 01:19:14.667
I won't let him call me
night after night
and week after week,

01:19:14.767 --> 01:19:16.067
every night, never.

01:19:16.133 --> 01:19:18.067
Yes, yes, yes, I know,
darling, but...
(SIGHING)

01:19:18.133 --> 01:19:20.167
But he wants you
to come downstairs.
No, no.

01:19:20.267 --> 01:19:23.200
Just a few minutes.
No, I won't.

01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:25.667
Leonora, please,
he's terribly furious.

01:19:25.767 --> 01:19:26.967
I've never seen him
so upset in my life.

01:19:27.067 --> 01:19:28.167
The doctor told
him we mustn't...

01:19:28.267 --> 01:19:31.200
The doctor told him
I mustn't go out
of the house.

01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:32.967
I must get some sleep.

01:19:33.067 --> 01:19:34.533
Darling, I...
He knows that.

01:19:34.633 --> 01:19:37.333
The doctor told him
he mustn't call me
and wake me,

01:19:37.433 --> 01:19:39.233
and take me out
of the house
at all hours.

01:19:39.333 --> 01:19:40.767
Just this last time.

01:19:40.867 --> 01:19:42.267
No, I can't.

01:19:42.367 --> 01:19:45.167
Please.
No, no, I won't.
I won't.

01:19:45.533 --> 01:19:46.933
I won't.

01:20:14.033 --> 01:20:17.567
Larry.
Larry, I need you.
(CRYING)

01:20:17.667 --> 01:20:21.067
Larry, they won't
let me sleep.

01:20:21.167 --> 01:20:24.700
I wanna sleep, Larry.
I want help.
(SOBBING)

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:26.633
Please, Larry, make
them leave me alone.

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:32.400
Smith.
Is she coming down?

01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:34.267
She's very sick.
I feel sorry for her.

01:20:34.367 --> 01:20:37.033
I think it's a mistake.
A woman in her condition,
to treat her like...

01:20:37.133 --> 01:20:40.233
Is she coming down?

01:20:40.333 --> 01:20:43.467
Why the devil do you think
I sent you up there,
you dirty little parasite?

01:20:43.567 --> 01:20:45.733
Get her down here.

01:20:45.833 --> 01:20:49.300
I think I'd prefer
to be a headwaiter
again, Mr. Ohlrig.

01:20:55.833 --> 01:20:59.500
You know, you're
a big man but not big
enough to destroy that girl.

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:01.867
Goodbye.

01:21:08.433 --> 01:21:09.900
Dirty little snake.

01:21:12.567 --> 01:21:13.833
Not big enough to...

01:21:16.767 --> 01:21:18.567
If she doesn't come down...

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:23.700
(BANGING)

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:25.433
(CLATTERING)
SMITH: Leonora!

01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:30.100
(YELLING)

01:21:43.733 --> 01:21:45.067
(GROANING)

01:22:00.833 --> 01:22:03.567
SMITH: (WHEEZING)

01:22:15.167 --> 01:22:16.433
(GROANING)
Leonora.

01:22:17.933 --> 01:22:20.067
Get me some water.

01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:22.233
Get me some water.

01:22:23.967 --> 01:22:25.067
Leonora.

01:22:26.833 --> 01:22:27.833
Please...

01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:31.600
Please...
Get me some...

01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:33.800
Water.

01:22:37.467 --> 01:22:38.633
Leonora.

01:22:41.933 --> 01:22:43.067
Leonora...

01:22:45.733 --> 01:22:47.067
I need some...

01:22:49.067 --> 01:22:51.267
Water.
Water.

01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:57.067
DOCTOR: Blood pressure,
110 over 70.
EKG, normal.

01:22:57.133 --> 01:23:00.200
He'll live.
Discontinue the oxygen.

01:23:03.533 --> 01:23:05.500
(MURMURING)

01:23:35.333 --> 01:23:36.400
Le?

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:37.900
LEONORA: I killed him.

01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:41.400
Le.
I killed him.

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:47.067
He was lying
on the floor and
I left him there.

01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:49.767
I killed him.

01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:55.267
I called you.
I'm here, darling.
I'm here.

01:23:56.067 --> 01:23:57.633
I killed him.

01:23:58.467 --> 01:23:59.900
I did.

01:24:01.633 --> 01:24:02.833
I killed him.

01:24:06.667 --> 01:24:09.067
LEONORA: I wanted
him to die.

01:24:09.567 --> 01:24:10.667
Larry.

01:24:12.067 --> 01:24:13.533
Larry, I need you.

01:24:14.567 --> 01:24:18.500
I want...
I want you back.

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:20.700
Here, take
a drink of this.
I want you back and...

01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:22.733
Put your head back.
Put your head back.

01:24:24.433 --> 01:24:26.067
There.

01:24:26.167 --> 01:24:27.333
One of his pills...

01:24:29.133 --> 01:24:31.967
And I called his doctor...
Now, hold on.
Take another drink.

01:24:34.433 --> 01:24:37.333
There now.
You'll be all right.

01:24:37.433 --> 01:24:39.100
And the doctor...

01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:43.067
Says he's going
to die.
He won't.

01:24:44.067 --> 01:24:46.067
I wanted him to die.

01:24:46.767 --> 01:24:49.700
Now, be quite.
Be quiet now.

01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:51.733
I'm with you.
You're gonna be safe.

01:24:51.833 --> 01:24:53.467
Nothing's gonna
happen to you.

01:24:53.567 --> 01:24:57.767
Oh, Larry, I wanted
you so...
Mmm-hmm.

01:24:57.867 --> 01:25:01.533
When he said he'd take
my baby away...

01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:03.467
He said...

01:25:04.367 --> 01:25:07.667
(GRUNTING)
Oh, Larry.

01:25:09.067 --> 01:25:10.533
Larry, it hurts!

01:25:13.733 --> 01:25:15.300
LEONORA: (GROANING)
Oh!

01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:23.400
Stay here.
Don't move.

01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:25.067
I'll be back in a minute.

01:25:35.667 --> 01:25:36.900
Is there a telephone
down here, sir?

01:25:37.067 --> 01:25:39.500
Yes, sir, the left
of the front door, sir.
Okay, I got it.

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:45.133
Is it over right here?
Thank you.
MAN: Right in there, sir.

01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:50.500
Operator.

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:53.767
(SIREN WAILING)

01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:01.833
He isn't gonna die.
You didn't kill him.

01:26:01.933 --> 01:26:03.900
I had a long talk
with his doctor.

01:26:04.067 --> 01:26:07.600
He'll live to be
an old man.
But you...

01:26:08.833 --> 01:26:11.933
Hey, listen,
can you hear me?

01:26:12.067 --> 01:26:15.933
You can only live
if you want to
and you must want to.

01:26:16.067 --> 01:26:18.667
That's why it's so
important that you
hear what I'm saying.

01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:24.133
He wanted to take
your child away,
maybe he succeeded.

01:26:24.233 --> 01:26:27.767
Your child will die
and it's a terrible
thing, I know, but...

01:26:27.867 --> 01:26:29.767
You'll be free
to start living.

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:33.067
Isn't that true?

01:26:36.067 --> 01:26:39.167
He can't hold
you anymore.
He won't even want to.

01:26:39.267 --> 01:26:41.467
All he wanted was
to dominate you and kick

01:26:41.567 --> 01:26:43.633
you around like
everybody else.

01:26:43.733 --> 01:26:47.367
Only care about
the child was to use it,

01:26:47.467 --> 01:26:49.100
to keep you
under his thumb.

01:26:49.967 --> 01:26:51.533
But now you'll be free.

01:26:52.267 --> 01:26:53.800
Free to start living.

01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:57.400
Free to be happy,
doing the things
that are worthwhile.

01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:00.633
You can be
happy, darling.

01:27:01.733 --> 01:27:04.067
That's why I want
you to hear me.

01:27:07.133 --> 01:27:08.600
I hear you, Larry.

01:27:19.967 --> 01:27:22.767
Larry, Larry.
She's okay.

01:27:22.867 --> 01:27:25.100
Pre-mature birth,
the baby died.

01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:30.433
LARRY: He can't hold her now,
even if he wants to.

01:27:31.267 --> 01:27:32.767
She's free.

01:27:33.833 --> 01:27:35.700
She shouldn't see anybody.
Oh, sure.

01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:38.100
(CHUCKLING)
I'll give you
two minutes.

01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:55.367
DR. HOFFMAN: Where are you
taking that?

01:27:55.467 --> 01:27:57.067
In here.
No, no, she can't
be disturbed.

01:27:57.100 --> 01:28:00.067
But Jacqueline doesn't
want to be responsible
for the darn coat, Doctor.

01:28:00.133 --> 01:28:03.700
Don't worry about it.
If my diagnosis is correct,
she won't want that anyway.

01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:05.267
All right.
