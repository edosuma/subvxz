WEBVTT

00:06.707 --> 00:08.008
PREVIOUSLY ON TWISTED...

00:08.008 --> 00:09.210
- Desai's return
to Green Grove High

00:09.210 --> 00:11.042
from the juvenile
detention facility

00:11.042 --> 00:13.544
that has held him
for the past five years

00:13.544 --> 00:15.046
since he strangled his aunt...

00:15.046 --> 00:17.288
- KAREN NEVER CHANGES.

00:17.288 --> 00:18.589
SHE'S ALWAYS READY
FOR HER CLOSE-UP.

00:18.589 --> 00:20.121
Karen: PRINCIPAL TANG,

00:20.121 --> 00:21.552
ONCE EVERYONE GETS USED
TO HAVING HIM BACK,

00:21.552 --> 00:23.394
THINGS WILL
RETURN BACK TO NORMAL.

00:23.394 --> 00:25.496
I AM THROWING A PARTY
AT MY HOUSE TONIGHT.

00:25.496 --> 00:27.658
- YOU IN?
- WHERE'D YOU GET THAT NECKLACE?

00:27.658 --> 00:29.230
Jo: I KNOW ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.302
Lacey:
PLEASE DON'T TELL ANYONE.

00:31.302 --> 00:33.204
I WON'T BECAUSE YOU
HAVE TO TELL EVERYONE.

00:33.204 --> 00:35.136
I WAS ASLEEP.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.767
Danny: REGINA TEXTED ME.

00:36.767 --> 00:39.140
- Kyle: THAT NECKLACE
LOOK FAMILIAR?
- NOT AT ALL.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.711
- Jo: WHY DID YOU KILL HER?
- Danny: I DIDN'T.

00:40.711 --> 00:42.373
I NEED YOU TO TRUST ME.

00:50.351 --> 00:54.785
Lacey: YES, REGINA DEFINITELY
KNEW HOW TO HAVE FUN.

00:54.785 --> 00:58.159
BUT SHE WAS MORE THAN JUST
THE LIFE OF THE PARTY.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.790
SHE WAS SMART...

00:59.790 --> 01:01.462
IN HER OWN WAY,

01:01.462 --> 01:04.165
SUPPORTIVE, LOYAL.

01:04.165 --> 01:07.098
THE KIND OF FRIEND
YOU COULD OPEN UP TO,

01:07.098 --> 01:09.400
WHO YOU COULD TELL ANYTHING TO.

01:14.605 --> 01:17.178
AND SHE WAS ALWAYS THERE
READY TO LISTEN

01:17.178 --> 01:19.150
AND THEN OFFER
HER GREAT, FUNNY,

01:19.150 --> 01:20.451
REGINA-PATENTED ADVICE.

01:20.451 --> 01:22.213
REGINA LOVED THE BEATLES.

01:22.213 --> 01:24.855
WE'D ALWAYS LISTEN TO
LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS.

01:24.855 --> 01:26.687
Young Lacey: LAST ONE THERE
STARTS THE FIRE.

01:26.687 --> 01:28.389
Young Danny: I SAY
FIRST ONE GETS TO.

01:28.389 --> 01:30.321
Jo: DANNY,
YOU'RE SUCH A PYRO.

01:30.321 --> 01:32.363
ME?
YOU ALWAYS START IT.

01:32.363 --> 01:33.564
Lacey: YOU FOOLS
KEEP TALKING.

01:33.564 --> 01:34.825
I'M GONNA WIN.

01:34.825 --> 01:35.866
Tess: JO...

01:35.866 --> 01:38.129
HONEY, YOU OKAY?

01:38.129 --> 01:40.301
YEAH.

01:40.301 --> 01:41.402
Lacey: WE ALWAYS USED
TO LOVE TO LISTEN

01:41.402 --> 01:42.733
TO THE MOTION CITY SOUNDTRACK

01:42.733 --> 01:44.305
AND DRIVE TO THE MALL.

01:44.305 --> 01:48.879
( whispering )

01:51.412 --> 01:53.644
- HEY.
- HEY.

01:53.644 --> 01:55.146
THANKS FOR COMING.

01:55.146 --> 01:56.116
SURE.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.749
IT WAS A GOOD SPEECH.

01:58.749 --> 02:02.193
UM, IT WAS WELL-STRUCTURED.

02:02.193 --> 02:05.226
OH, WELL, THANKS.

02:05.226 --> 02:07.298
Tess: LACEY...

02:09.760 --> 02:11.362
I'M SO SORRY.

02:11.362 --> 02:12.563
THANKS, MRS. MASTERSON.

02:12.563 --> 02:13.734
WE WERE PROUD OF YOU
UP THERE.

02:14.805 --> 02:16.407
HOW ARE YOU AND
YOUR FRIENDS DOING?

02:16.407 --> 02:17.568
OKAY.

02:17.568 --> 02:18.869
WE'RE HANGING IN THERE.

02:18.869 --> 02:20.371
IN A WEIRD WAY,
LOSING REGINA

02:20.371 --> 02:21.472
HAS BROUGHT US
ALL CLOSER.

02:23.574 --> 02:25.145
I KNOW IT'S
A DIFFICULT TIME, LACEY,

02:25.145 --> 02:26.547
BUT I DO NEED YOU
TO COME IN

02:26.547 --> 02:28.449
AND GIVE YOUR
OFFICIAL STATEMENT.

02:28.449 --> 02:30.281
- MY STATEMENT?
- WE'RE TALKING TO EVERYONE

02:30.281 --> 02:32.383
THAT WAS AT THAT PARTY,
ANYONE WHO KNEW REGINA,

02:32.383 --> 02:33.384
WHOEVER CAN HELP US.

02:33.384 --> 02:34.785
Jo: DON'T WAIT TOO LONG

02:34.785 --> 02:36.727
OR HE'LL DRAG YOU OUT
IN FRONT OF THE ENTIRE SCHOOL.

02:36.727 --> 02:37.828
IT'S KIND OF HIS THING.

02:37.828 --> 02:39.490
- WE TALKED ABOUT THAT.
- YOU TALKED.

02:39.490 --> 02:41.292
CAN WE NOT DO THIS
RIGHT NOW, PLEASE?

02:41.292 --> 02:42.893
I'M SURE I DON'T HAVE
TO REMIND YOU,

02:42.893 --> 02:45.196
BUT DANNY DESAI IS NOT
SOMEONE THAT YOU SHOULD

02:45.196 --> 02:46.667
ASSOCIATE WITH RIGHT NOW,

02:46.667 --> 02:48.239
AT LEAST UNTIL WE CAN
PIECE TOGETHER WHAT HAPPENED,

02:48.239 --> 02:50.170
WHICH IS WHY WE
NEED TO GATHER

02:50.170 --> 02:51.872
THESE STATEMENTS
AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.

02:51.872 --> 02:54.305
I'LL COME IN,
BUT I WON'T BE ABLE TO
TELL YOU ANYTHING USEFUL.

02:54.305 --> 02:55.776
YOU NEVER KNOW

02:55.776 --> 02:56.807
WHAT MIGHT BE USEFUL.

02:56.807 --> 02:58.649
YEAH, YOU NEVER KNOW.

02:59.950 --> 03:01.782
I'VE GOT TO RUN.
I'M LATE TO MEET SOMEONE.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.614
RICO, RIGHT?

03:03.614 --> 03:05.316
OF COURSE, DAD.
WHO ELSE?

03:14.865 --> 03:16.927
WELL, YOU'RE PROBABLY
THE ONLY 16-YEAR-OLD LEFT

03:16.927 --> 03:17.828
WHO READS THE PAPER.

03:17.828 --> 03:19.800
JUST CATCHING UP
ON THE NEWS.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.372
THE MIDDLE EAST
IS STILL A MESS, HUH?

03:21.372 --> 03:23.704
I ALREADY READ IT, DANNY.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.536
I WAKE UP EARLY
FOR PILATES, REMEMBER.

03:25.536 --> 03:26.677
HOW COULD I FORGET?

03:26.677 --> 03:29.310
WELL, AT LEAST THEY USED
A COOL PICTURE.

03:29.310 --> 03:30.981
MENACING...

03:30.981 --> 03:32.913
REALLY WORKS
FOR MY COMPLEXION,
DON'T YOU THINK?

03:32.913 --> 03:34.485
WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU CAN MAKE JOKES.

03:34.485 --> 03:37.248
WELL, DAD ALWAYS SAID
IF YOU CAN'T LAUGH,

03:37.248 --> 03:38.389
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
BE DEAD.

03:38.389 --> 03:39.920
IF YOUR FATHER WAS HERE,

03:39.920 --> 03:41.822
HE WOULD WANT YOU TO DO
EVERYTHING POSSIBLE

03:41.822 --> 03:43.494
TO SOLVE YOUR SITUATION.

03:43.494 --> 03:45.426
( sighs ) MOTHER,
WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS.

03:45.426 --> 03:47.658
I'M NOT USING LACEY
AS AN ALIBI.

03:47.658 --> 03:49.400
SHE WAS WITH YOU
THE WHOLE NIGHT.

03:49.400 --> 03:50.831
YEAH, AND WE WERE ASLEEP.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.733
I'M NOT DRAGGING HER INTO THIS.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.005
IF THE POLICE FIND SOME WAY
TO PIN THIS ON YOU,

03:55.005 --> 03:57.568
YOU COULD GO TO JAIL
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

03:57.568 --> 03:58.909
REAL JAIL THIS TIME.

03:58.909 --> 04:00.811
- NOT JUVIE.
- YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW THAT?

04:00.811 --> 04:02.573
I WANT TO HELP YOU
SO BADLY.

04:02.573 --> 04:04.315
BUT I'M GONNA
FIGURE THIS OUT.

04:04.315 --> 04:05.776
OKAY? AND JO'S HELPING ME.

04:05.776 --> 04:07.678
JO'S A SWEET GIRL.

04:07.678 --> 04:09.820
IT'S THE MASTERSONS
THAT CAN'T BE TRUSTED.

04:09.820 --> 04:12.983
WELL, I GET HATING
CHIEF MASTERSON,

04:12.983 --> 04:14.455
BUT WHAT DO YOU GOT
AGAINST TESS?

04:15.826 --> 04:17.328
NOTHING.

04:19.960 --> 04:23.794
WELL, JO HAS BEEN
PRETTY FREAKING FORGIVING.

04:23.794 --> 04:25.566
SO SHE MUST HAVE
INHERITED IT FROM SOMEONE.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.898
CHEER UP, MOTHER.

04:27.898 --> 04:29.770
EVERYONE MAY HATE ME NOW,

04:29.770 --> 04:31.302
BUT THE POLICE NEED
REAL EVIDENCE

04:31.302 --> 04:33.043
TO PIN THIS ON ME.

04:33.043 --> 04:34.445
EVIDENCE THEY
CLEARLY DON'T HAVE.

05:01.602 --> 05:03.003
Lacey: STAKING OUT
A MEMORIAL SERVICE--

05:03.003 --> 05:04.975
WOW, KEEP IT CLASSY,
LOCAL NEWS.

05:04.975 --> 05:06.937
Archie: CHILL, BABY,
REGINA WOULD LOVE IT.

05:06.937 --> 05:08.639
YEAH, SHE DID ALWAYS
WANT TO BE FAMOUS.

05:08.639 --> 05:10.080
SHE TOLD ME ONCE
THAT SHE WANTED TO BE

05:10.080 --> 05:11.882
A WEATHER PERSON
LIKE AL ROKER...

05:11.882 --> 05:14.645
BUT YOU KNOW, WHITE,

05:14.645 --> 05:16.447
AND A LADY.

05:16.447 --> 05:17.548
WELL, THANKS TO PSYCHO BOY,

05:17.548 --> 05:18.949
SHE'S DEFINITELY GETTING
HER 15 MINUTES.

05:20.351 --> 05:23.023
LIGHTEN UP. WE CAN'T BE
EULOGY-PROFOUND ALL THE TIME.

05:25.956 --> 05:26.997
Phoebe: SHE WAS MY REGINA,

05:26.997 --> 05:28.929
YOU KNOW?
IT'S LIKE...

05:28.929 --> 05:30.961
I LOST A PART OF ME--

05:30.961 --> 05:35.806
LIKE ONE OF MY RIBS
OR MY SPLEEN.

05:35.806 --> 05:37.638
YOU ONLY HAVE ONE SPLEEN.

05:37.638 --> 05:40.441
I ONLY HAD ONE REGINA.

05:40.441 --> 05:41.712
ARE YOU HEARING THIS?

05:41.712 --> 05:44.675
YEAH, DID SHE JUST COMPARE
REGINA TO A SPLEEN?

05:44.675 --> 05:45.816
THAT'S SO GROSS.

05:45.816 --> 05:46.877
PHOEBE HATED REGINA.

05:46.877 --> 05:48.078
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN
FRIENDS FOR MONTHS.

05:48.078 --> 05:51.382
IF THERE IS A HEAVEN,

05:51.382 --> 05:55.526
I AM SURE THAT
REGINA IS THERE.

05:55.526 --> 05:59.129
AND I KNOW THAT SHE IS WEARING
THE CUTEST OUTFIT.

05:59.129 --> 06:01.462
OKAY, SHE LITERALLY TOLD REGINA
SHE'D SEE HER IN HELL.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.834
PHOEBE'S A THEATER FREAK.
LET HER PERFORM.

06:03.834 --> 06:05.936
DOESN'T IT
PISS YOU GUYS OFF?

06:05.936 --> 06:08.068
THE ONLY THING PISSING ME OFF
IS THE FOOD AT THE MEMORIAL.

06:08.068 --> 06:10.441
WEAK.

06:10.441 --> 06:12.703
LET'S GET SOME PIZZA.

06:12.703 --> 06:14.575
WHEN IS THIS GONNA AIR?

06:20.150 --> 06:22.413
THE TEXT WAS THE ONLY REASON
HE BROUGHT YOU IN, RIGHT?

06:22.413 --> 06:23.854
YEAH, THAT'S IT.

06:23.854 --> 06:26.917
ONE BOOTY-CALL TEXT--
ONE REALLY DISTURBING
BOOTY-CALL TEXT.

06:26.917 --> 06:28.559
GOD, I HATE WHEN THAT HAPPENS.

06:28.559 --> 06:29.920
IT'S HARD OUT THERE
FOR A PIMP.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.862
WHAT ELSE DID HE ASK YOU?

06:31.862 --> 06:33.093
NOT MUCH.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.865
OKAY, IN MURDER MYSTERY
PARLANCE

06:34.865 --> 06:36.527
THE TEXT IS KNOWN
AS A RED HERRING.

06:36.527 --> 06:38.028
YEAH, A RED HERRING
MY DAD'S BASING

06:38.028 --> 06:39.399
HIS ENTIRE CASE ON.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.171
WELL, THEN IT'S A WEAK CASE.
THEY HAVE NOTHING

06:41.171 --> 06:42.903
UNLESS THEY CAN CONNECT
DANNY TO THE CRIME SCENE.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.676
YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DO THIS,
RICO?

06:45.676 --> 06:48.439
I MEAN,
JO IS KINDA STUCK WITH ME

06:48.439 --> 06:50.541
AFTER HER LITTLE SPEECH
TO THE WHOLE SCHOOL,

06:50.541 --> 06:51.882
BUT YOU COULD STILL AVOID
THE HASSLE.

06:51.882 --> 06:52.913
NO.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.445
IF JO TRUSTS YOU,
I TRUST YOU.

06:54.445 --> 06:55.516
BESIDES,

06:55.516 --> 06:57.548
I LOVE SOLVING MYSTERIES.

06:57.548 --> 06:59.750
"MURDER SHE WROTE"
IS RICO'S FAVORITE SHOW.

06:59.750 --> 07:02.853
HE HAS A WEIRD THING
FOR ANGELA LANSBURY.

07:02.853 --> 07:04.424
NO.

07:04.424 --> 07:07.427
I HAVE A THING
FOR HER CHARACTER,
JESSICA FLETCHER.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.428
THERE'S REALLY
A BIG DIFFERENCE.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.429
IS THERE?

07:09.429 --> 07:10.601
YEAH,
ANGELA LANSBURY

07:10.601 --> 07:12.663
IS THE ACTRESS AND SINGER.

07:12.663 --> 07:13.964
AND JESSICA FLETCHER
IS THE MYSTERY WRITER

07:13.964 --> 07:15.005
AND AMATEUR DETECTIVE.

07:15.005 --> 07:16.136
WHAT IS IT THAT
ATTRACTS YOU?

07:16.136 --> 07:18.438
IS IT LIKE THE TWEED?
DO YOU LIKE TWEED?

07:18.438 --> 07:20.010
- I DON'T...
- SHE'S JUST A CLASSY LADY.

07:20.010 --> 07:23.073
SO IF MY DAD'S FOCUSED
ON THIS TEXT,

07:23.073 --> 07:25.876
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHO ELSE HAD A REASON

07:25.876 --> 07:26.947
TO HURT REGINA.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.448
OKAY, WELL, JESSICA FLETCHER

07:28.448 --> 07:30.020
WOULD START WITH THE PEOPLE
CLOSEST TO THE VICTIM.

07:30.020 --> 07:33.754
WELL, ARCHIE'S AN ASS.

07:33.754 --> 07:36.727
SCOTT'S A GROPING DOUCHE
WITH IMPULSE CONTROL PROBLEMS.

07:36.727 --> 07:39.029
SARITA PROBABLY
DROWNS KITTENS FOR FUN.

07:39.029 --> 07:40.531
WHAT ABOUT LACEY?

07:40.531 --> 07:42.493
I MEAN SHE'S REGINA'S BFF,
RIGHT?

07:42.493 --> 07:45.235
YEAH, BUT LACEY
WOULDN'T HURT ANYONE.

07:45.235 --> 07:48.699
NO STONE UNTURNED, RIGHT?

07:48.699 --> 07:50.240
J. FLETCHER WOULD
TOTALLY AGREE WITH THAT.

07:50.240 --> 07:52.673
Scott: DANNY SAID
THAT HE'D KILL ME.

07:52.673 --> 07:55.075
AND THAT HE'D ENJOY IT.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.847
JUST LIKE LAST TIME.

07:56.847 --> 07:58.679
OKAY.

07:58.679 --> 08:00.981
THANKS FOR COMING IN, SCOTT.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.013
- THAT'S IT?
- WE'LL LET YOU KNOW
IF WE NEED MORE.

08:04.955 --> 08:06.186
I THINK HE DID IT.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.919
YEAH, I KNOW YOU DO.

08:08.919 --> 08:10.591
WHAT, DO YOU THINK
HE'S LYING?

08:10.591 --> 08:12.022
HE'S NOT SMART ENOUGH
TO LIE.

08:12.022 --> 08:13.063
YOU REALLY BELIEVE

08:13.063 --> 08:14.595
THAT ONE RANDOM TEXT
ABOUT A MURDER

08:14.595 --> 08:15.896
HE COMMITTED FIVE YEARS AGO

08:15.896 --> 08:17.998
WOULD BE ENOUGH TO
MAKE HIM GO BACK?

08:17.998 --> 08:20.631
IF SOMEBODY CLAIMED TO KNOW
YOUR DEEPEST DARKEST SECRET,

08:20.631 --> 08:21.872
WOULDN'T YOU WANT
TO GO ASK HIM ABOUT IT?

08:21.872 --> 08:25.035
YOU KNOW ME. I MEAN,
I'M AN OPEN BOOK.

08:25.035 --> 08:28.038
ALL RIGHT, SO WHERE ARE WE
WITH THE NECKLACE?

08:28.038 --> 08:30.541
WELL, THE PARENTS CONFIRMED
SHE NEVER TOOK IT OFF.

08:30.541 --> 08:32.182
SHE STARTED WEARING IT ABOUT
SIX OR SEVEN MONTHS AGO,

08:32.182 --> 08:34.044
BUT THEY HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE IT CAME FROM.

08:34.044 --> 08:35.085
YOU THINK HE RECOGNIZED IT?

08:35.085 --> 08:37.648
DANNY HAS A VERY GOOD
POKER FACE.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.191
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
JO WAS WITH HIM...

08:41.191 --> 08:42.793
DRUNK.
SO UNLIKE HER.

08:42.793 --> 08:44.625
HEY, SHE'S A TEENAGER.

08:44.625 --> 08:47.157
AND DANNY IS PRETTY DREAMY.

08:47.157 --> 08:48.929
DON'T MAKE THIS PERSONAL, BOSS.

08:48.929 --> 08:51.732
WHEN IT'S ABOUT YOUR KID,
EVERYTHING IS PERSONAL.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.938
SO, ONCE ALL THIS
CRAZINESS BLOWS OVER,

08:57.938 --> 08:59.710
WE CAN ACTUALLY START
TALKING ABOUT OTHER THINGS.

08:59.710 --> 09:03.574
YOU KNOW, NORMAL STUFF:
MOVIES, BOOKS, MUSIC,
POPULAR CULTURE.

09:03.574 --> 09:05.616
YOU CAN EXPLAIN TO ME
WHO THE KARDASHIANS ARE
FOR INSTANCE.

09:05.616 --> 09:07.047
- YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
- JO!

09:07.047 --> 09:09.279
DAD, DANNY AND I
WERE JUST--

09:09.279 --> 09:11.822
- GET IN THE CAR.
- OKAY, CALM DOWN.

09:14.855 --> 09:15.886
CAR, NOW!

09:15.886 --> 09:18.859
CHIEF MASTERSON.
HELLO, SIR.

09:18.859 --> 09:21.261
WE'RE JUST GRABBING A BITE.
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

09:21.261 --> 09:22.893
I'M TRYING TO GIVE YOU
A FAIR SHAKE.

09:22.893 --> 09:24.234
DON'T MAKE IT HARDER FOR ME.

09:24.234 --> 09:25.235
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN, SIR.

09:25.235 --> 09:27.698
STAY AWAY FROM
MY DAUGHTER.

09:27.698 --> 09:29.169
( muffled noise
from police radio )

09:53.023 --> 09:55.365
BECAUSE HE'S POTENTIALLY
A SERIAL KILLER.

09:55.365 --> 09:57.167
SERIAL KILLER, REALLY?

09:57.167 --> 09:58.328
WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:58.328 --> 09:59.900
I WAS DRIVING HOME

09:59.900 --> 10:01.832
WHEN I PASSED YOUR DAUGHTER
ON MAIN STREET

10:01.832 --> 10:03.674
WITH OUR GOOD FRIEND
DANNY DESAI

10:03.674 --> 10:05.936
AFTER I SPECIFICALLY
TOLD HER TO STAY AWAY FROM HIM.

10:05.936 --> 10:07.908
YOU SUGGESTED
I STAY AWAY FROM HIM,

10:07.908 --> 10:09.980
A SUGGESTION
WHICH I CHOSE NOT TO TAKE.

10:09.980 --> 10:12.913
I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SAFETY
OF EVERYONE IN THIS TOWN.

10:12.913 --> 10:14.284
ESPECIALLY YOU.

10:14.284 --> 10:16.386
- SOMEONE'S ON A POWER TRIP.
- JO, ENOUGH.

10:16.386 --> 10:18.618
MOM, DANNY DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING WRONG.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.020
HE'S JUST
AN EASY TARGET.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.092
ANY EVIDENCE DAD THINKS
HE HAS AGAINST HIM

10:22.092 --> 10:23.894
IS WEAK AND CIRCUMSTANTIAL
AT BEST.

10:23.894 --> 10:24.995
WHO ARE YOU, JONNY COCHRAN?

10:24.995 --> 10:26.827
SORRY, I DON'T KNOW
WHO THAT IS.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.098
MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING

10:28.098 --> 10:29.760
- ABOUT MURDER CASES.
- MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE

10:29.760 --> 10:31.802
- I'M NOT 50.
- STOP IT, BOTH OF YOU.

10:31.802 --> 10:34.665
JO, YOUR DAD ISN'T SAYING
YOU CAN NEVER SEE DANNY.

10:34.665 --> 10:36.807
JUST NOT RIGHT NOW,
WHILE THE CASE IS PENDING.

10:36.807 --> 10:37.808
RIGHT, KYLE?

10:38.669 --> 10:39.870
SEE?

10:39.870 --> 10:41.912
- UNREASONABLE.
- JO, I KNOW THIS IS HARD,

10:41.912 --> 10:43.343
BUT YOU'VE GOT
TO TRUST ME.

10:43.343 --> 10:44.945
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHY
RIGHT NOW,

10:44.945 --> 10:46.747
BUT MY GUT IS TELLING ME
DANNY DID THIS.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.819
YEAH, WELL, MY GUT'S
TELLING ME HE DIDN'T.

10:48.819 --> 10:50.380
AND I KNOW HIM BETTER.

10:50.380 --> 10:52.853
KNOW HIM?
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM AT ALL.

10:52.853 --> 10:55.055
YOU DON'T KNOW A BOY
WHO MURDERED HIS OWN AUNT.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.027
YOU DON'T KNOW A BOY
WHO SPENT FIVE YEARS

10:57.027 --> 10:58.228
- IN PRISON.
- JUVIE.

10:58.228 --> 11:01.692
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
HE WENT THROUGH IN THERE.

11:01.692 --> 11:04.294
TRUST ME.
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM AT ALL.

11:08.438 --> 11:10.771
HE'S WRONG.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.903
HE MEANS WELL.

11:12.903 --> 11:15.876
JUST GIVE THE WHOLE SITUATION
SOME TIME, OKAY?

11:25.886 --> 11:27.958
YEAH, CURLS.
CURLS ARE BETTER.

11:27.958 --> 11:30.060
GIRLS, HEY.

11:30.060 --> 11:31.862
HOW YOU HOLDING UP?

11:31.862 --> 11:33.924
PHOEBE, HI.
WE'RE FINE, THANKS.

11:33.924 --> 11:35.966
SO WE HAVEN'T HAD
A CHANCE TO TALK

11:35.966 --> 11:39.169
SINCE REGINA LEFT US.

11:39.169 --> 11:40.871
AND AS HER CLOSE GIRLFRIENDS,

11:40.871 --> 11:42.973
IT'S ON US TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO HONOR HER.

11:42.973 --> 11:44.404
WE COULD BURN A COW.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.737
DIDN'T THE GREEKS OR THE AZTECS

11:46.737 --> 11:48.879
OR WHOEVER BURN
CATTLE OR DOGS

11:48.879 --> 11:50.380
OR SOMETHING
TO HONOR THE DEAD?

11:53.143 --> 11:54.985
I HAVE LOTS OF IDEAS.

11:54.985 --> 11:58.118
UM, A MEMORIAL CONCERT,
A CHARITY DRIVE.

11:58.118 --> 12:02.292
I AM LOBBYING PRINCIPAL TANG
TO NAME THE CHEMISTRY LAB

12:02.292 --> 12:03.894
AFTER HER.

12:03.894 --> 12:05.856
CHEMISTRY WAS HER
FAVORITE SUBJECT.

12:05.856 --> 12:07.928
RIGHT.
WELL, LET'S TALK
ABOUT THIS LATER

12:07.928 --> 12:08.829
OKAY?
WE NEED TO RUN.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.861
SURE, YES.
TO BE CONTINUED.

12:10.861 --> 12:13.733
OH, ALSO-- THERE'S A GRIEF
SESSION AT SCHOOL TONIGHT

12:13.733 --> 12:16.907
WITH A PROMINENT LOCAL
GRIEF SPECIALIST.

12:16.907 --> 12:18.839
I'M CO-RUNNING IT
IF YOU WANT TO JOIN.

12:18.839 --> 12:19.810
PASS.

12:20.871 --> 12:21.942
WE'LL THINK ABOUT IT.
THANKS.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.844
OKAY.

12:23.844 --> 12:26.977
WELL, THAT WAS FUN.

12:26.977 --> 12:29.820
CHEMISTRY, REALLY?
ANYONE WHO KNEW REGINA

12:29.820 --> 12:31.521
KNEW HER FAVORITE SUBJECT
WAS FREE PERIOD.

12:31.521 --> 12:34.885
I WISH SHE WERE HERE
JUST TO MOCK THAT CONVERSATION.

12:36.787 --> 12:39.129
SOMETIMES IT'S LIKE
I CAN STILL HEAR HER LAUGH.

12:39.129 --> 12:41.461
- AND I TURN--
- CAN WE NOT?

12:41.461 --> 12:43.994
NOT WHAT?

12:43.994 --> 12:47.868
REGINA WAS A BIG OLD BITCH
AND WE LOVED HER,

12:47.868 --> 12:49.800
BUT SHE'S GONE NOW.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.502
WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO SAY?

13:11.561 --> 13:13.894
( doorbell rings )

13:18.929 --> 13:22.102
KAREN?
HI.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.904
DID I CATCH YOU
AT A BAD TIME?

13:23.904 --> 13:25.976
UH, NO.

13:25.976 --> 13:27.838
- OF COURSE, COME IN.
- THANK YOU.

13:31.842 --> 13:33.413
THANKS.

13:41.091 --> 13:43.954
WELL, I LOVE WHAT
YOU'VE DONE WITH THIS ROOM.

13:43.954 --> 13:45.195
IT'S A GREAT USE
OF LIMITED SPACE.

13:45.195 --> 13:48.959
OH, WELL, THANKS.

13:50.901 --> 13:54.034
KAREN, I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT VIK.

13:54.034 --> 13:55.936
I CAN'T EVEN
BEGIN TO IMAGINE

13:55.936 --> 13:56.967
WHAT YOU'VE
BEEN GOING THROUGH.

13:56.967 --> 13:59.940
YEAH, IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.942
I WANTED TO CALL,

14:01.942 --> 14:03.543
BUT YOU KNOW.

14:03.543 --> 14:06.116
OH WELL, THE FLOWERS
WERE LOVELY, TESS.

14:06.116 --> 14:11.081
VIK'S DEATH HAS BEEN
ESPECIALLY HARD ON DANNY.

14:11.081 --> 14:13.123
- I'M SURE.
- YEAH.

14:13.123 --> 14:15.585
I MEAN COMING BACK HERE
WAS A BIG ENOUGH CHALLENGE--

14:15.585 --> 14:17.027
WITHOUT HIS DAD?

14:17.027 --> 14:20.330
AND NOW WITH ALL THIS
UNFAIR SUSPICION

14:20.330 --> 14:22.632
AND BEING PULLED OUT
IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE SCHOOL,

14:22.632 --> 14:24.935
- IT'S--
- I WISH THAT HAD
HAPPENED DIFFERENTLY.

14:24.935 --> 14:27.867
DID KYLE SAY WHY HE DID THAT?

14:27.867 --> 14:30.000
I MEAN, I CAN'T UNDERSTAND

14:30.000 --> 14:32.502
WHY HE WAS SO UNPROFESSIONAL.

14:34.905 --> 14:36.947
KYLE AND I DON'T
DISCUSS HIS CASES.

14:40.450 --> 14:44.484
LOOK, TESS,
I KNOW THIS IS A LOT TO ASK.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.416
BUT FROM ONE MOM TO ANOTHER,

14:46.416 --> 14:48.358
COULD YOU PLEASE
TALK TO KYLE?

14:48.358 --> 14:50.620
REASON WITH HIM...

14:52.122 --> 14:53.663
UNLIKE LAST TIME.

14:56.967 --> 14:59.199
THAT WOULDN'T BE APPROPRIATE.

15:03.974 --> 15:05.535
BUT KAREN, PLEASE,

15:05.535 --> 15:08.638
IF YOU EVER WANT TO
GRAB LUNCH OR SOMETHING,

15:08.638 --> 15:10.410
IF YOU NEED SOMEONE
TO TALK TO--

15:10.410 --> 15:12.382
I'LL BE FINE, TESS.

15:12.382 --> 15:14.144
THANK YOU.

15:20.350 --> 15:21.421
Lacey: NO, SHE DIDN'T.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.652
THAT'S OBNOXIOUS.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.203
THIS OKAY?

15:33.203 --> 15:36.106
YOUR DAD DOESN'T HAVE LIKE
PSYCHO CAMS EVERYWHERE, DOES HE?

15:36.106 --> 15:39.209
I HAVE A PLAN.

15:39.209 --> 15:41.111
DOES IT INVOLVE BRAINWASHING?

15:41.111 --> 15:43.974
UH, SORT OF ACTUALLY,
MY MOM.

15:43.974 --> 15:45.645
OKAY, SO I SAY

15:45.645 --> 15:47.717
WE DO LIKE A FUN
LOW-KEY DINNER--

15:47.717 --> 15:51.151
JUST US AND OUR MOMS.
IF WE JUST SHOW MY MOM

15:51.151 --> 15:52.652
HOW NORMAL YOU ARE,
SHE CAN CONVINCE MY DAD

15:52.652 --> 15:54.254
TO TONE IT DOWN.
HE LISTENS TO HER.

15:54.254 --> 15:58.058
JO, I DON'T THINK OUR MOMS
ARE THAT CLOSE ANYMORE.

15:58.058 --> 16:01.031
I'M SORRY, BUT
IT'S KIND OF NAIVE

16:01.031 --> 16:03.663
TO THINK THAT A DINNER
IS GONNA FIX EVERYTHING.

16:03.663 --> 16:06.236
SO I'M NAIVE?

16:06.236 --> 16:08.298
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEANT.

16:08.298 --> 16:09.639
Archie: DON'T WORRY, JO.

16:09.639 --> 16:11.341
YOUR KILLER BOY-TOY HERE
WILL GET CONJUGAL VISITS

16:11.341 --> 16:12.542
ONCE HE'S BACK IN PRISON.

16:12.542 --> 16:15.745
AND WHEN YOU GET THERE,
MAYBE WE CAN BE ROOMIES.

16:15.745 --> 16:18.308
I CALL TOP BUNK.

16:18.308 --> 16:20.650
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

16:20.650 --> 16:23.753
- DANNY.
- YOU HEARD ME.

16:25.015 --> 16:27.617
WHY WOULD I END UP THERE?

16:27.617 --> 16:30.090
COME ON, PAL.
WE ALL KNOW THIS STORY.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.762
POPULAR JOCK, RIGHT?

16:32.762 --> 16:34.564
YOU PEAK EARLY.
YOU LOSE YOUR HAIR.

16:34.564 --> 16:36.626
YOU GET A BEER GUT
AND YOU BECOME A DRUNK.

16:36.626 --> 16:40.070
EITHER YOU'RE GOING TO PRISON
OR YOU'RE PUMPING GAS

16:40.070 --> 16:41.401
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

16:41.401 --> 16:42.772
Lacey: ARCHIE.

16:42.772 --> 16:44.274
DON'T.

16:44.274 --> 16:45.675
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

16:49.079 --> 16:51.581
YOU DON'T KNOW ME EITHER.

16:51.581 --> 16:53.143
Guy: GET HIM, ARCHIE.

16:53.143 --> 16:54.644
( murmuring )

17:01.020 --> 17:02.592
- COME ON.
- YOU CAN TAKE HIM.

17:07.457 --> 17:08.558
Teacher: HEY, HEY, HEY.

17:08.558 --> 17:09.559
BREAK IT UP.

17:10.560 --> 17:11.631
COME ON.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.204
ENOUGH.

17:16.166 --> 17:17.567
COME ON, GET UP.

17:26.416 --> 17:28.548
I CAN'T BELIEVE PRINCIPAL TANG
IS PUNISHING ME.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.080
YOU'RE LUCKY
HE DIDN'T EXPEL YOU.

17:30.080 --> 17:31.651
I WISH HE DID.
GRIEF SESSION!

17:31.651 --> 17:33.483
I'D RATHER JAB OUT MY EYES.

17:33.483 --> 17:34.724
MAYBE IT'LL BE
GOOD FOR YOU.

17:37.327 --> 17:39.159
YOU CLEARLY HAVE
SOME PENT-UP ANGER.

17:39.159 --> 17:41.391
THE GUY MURDERED
OUR FRIEND.

17:41.391 --> 17:43.793
- WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?
- YOUR SIDE.

17:43.793 --> 17:45.795
BUT YOU OBVIOUSLY
OVERREACTED BACK THERE.

17:45.795 --> 17:47.537
THE FREAK GOADED ME.

17:47.537 --> 17:49.339
I'M NOT SAYING
IT WASN'T HIS FAULT.

17:49.339 --> 17:50.840
BUT MAYBE TALKING ABOUT

17:50.840 --> 17:52.342
ALL THIS TONIGHT
WILL BE GOOD FOR YOU.

17:52.342 --> 17:54.444
WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH,
IT'S NOT EASY.

17:54.444 --> 17:55.705
WE ALL MISS REGINA.

17:55.705 --> 17:57.407
- I JUST FEEL LIKE--
- STOP, LACE-- SAVE IT.

17:57.407 --> 17:59.479
I DON'T FEEL LIKE
BEING LECTURED RIGHT NOW.

17:59.479 --> 18:00.650
I'M NOT LECTURING YOU.

18:08.188 --> 18:10.460
WILL YOU COME WITH ME TONIGHT?

18:10.460 --> 18:13.263
I CAN'T.
I CAN'T SIT THERE LISTENING

18:13.263 --> 18:14.494
TO PHOEBE MAKE
REGINA'S DEATH

18:14.494 --> 18:15.695
- ALL ABOUT HER.
- SO SOME PEOPLE

18:15.695 --> 18:17.497
AREN'T GRIEVING ENOUGH
AND OTHER PEOPLE

18:17.497 --> 18:18.768
ARE GRIEVING TOO MUCH.

18:18.768 --> 18:20.730
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID.
- OF COURSE IT IS.

18:20.730 --> 18:22.572
YOU'RE PERFECT
AND EVERYONE ELSE

18:22.572 --> 18:24.604
CAN'T HANDLE
THEIR OWN EMOTIONS.

18:33.143 --> 18:35.615
HEY. THE TANG HAS SPOKEN.

18:35.615 --> 18:38.188
I HAVE TO START SEEING
A SCHOOL-SPONSORED THERAPIST.

18:38.188 --> 18:40.250
BETTER THAN GETTING EXPELLED,
THOUGH, RIGHT?

18:42.552 --> 18:43.853
WHAT, ARE YOU MAD AT ME?

18:43.853 --> 18:46.696
NO, I'M JUST NOT WASTING
ANY MORE OF MY TIME

18:46.696 --> 18:48.598
HELPING SOMEONE WHO
DOESN'T WANT TO HELP HIMSELF.

18:48.598 --> 18:50.600
I DO WANT TO HELP MYSELF.

18:50.600 --> 18:53.603
REALLY?
OKAY, LET'S LOOK
AT THE EVIDENCE.

18:53.603 --> 18:56.506
YOU WON'T TELL ANYONE
WHY YOU KILLED YOUR AUNT.

18:56.506 --> 18:58.268
- YEAH--
- I KNOW.
YOU'RE PROTECTING ME.

18:58.268 --> 18:59.869
FINE, WHATEVER.

18:59.869 --> 19:03.613
BUT YOU ALSO REFUSE
TO USE LACEY AS AN ALIBI.

19:03.613 --> 19:06.276
- JO, I TOLD YOU--
- YOU WERE ASLEEP.
LACEY WAS ASLEEP. I GET IT.

19:06.276 --> 19:08.278
BUT THEN WHILE I'M
STICKING UP FOR YOU

19:08.278 --> 19:10.720
TO THE ENTIRE SCHOOL
AND DEFENDING YOU TO MY PARENTS,

19:10.720 --> 19:13.353
YOU GO AND GET
INTO A HUGE FIGHT

19:13.353 --> 19:14.354
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.

19:17.827 --> 19:20.390
MAYBE YOU ARE THE DELINQUENT
MY DAD SAYS YOU ARE.

19:20.390 --> 19:23.533
NICE.

19:23.533 --> 19:26.165
WHATEVER.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.338
I'M MEETING UP
WITH RICO TO STUDY.

19:28.338 --> 19:30.169
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.170
IS THIS ALL BECAUSE I REJECTED

19:31.170 --> 19:32.842
YOUR LITTLE MOM-DINNER IDEA,
OR WHAT?

19:32.842 --> 19:36.606
DO YOU REALLY THINK
AFTER THE WAY YOU JUST ACTED

19:36.606 --> 19:38.678
I'D LET YOU ANYWHERE
NEAR MY MOTHER?

19:48.388 --> 19:49.819
DID YOU TALK
TO THE SCHOOL BOARD?

19:49.819 --> 19:52.222
YES, EVERYTHING'S FINE.

19:52.222 --> 19:53.423
OH GOOD.

19:53.423 --> 19:55.194
FOR NOW,

19:55.194 --> 19:56.596
BUT EVERYONE'S
PRETTY FREAKED OUT

19:56.596 --> 19:57.797
BY DANNY'S VIOLENT
OUTBURST.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.599
BUT HE SAID THE OTHER BOY
STARTED IT.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.631
THE OTHER BOY ISN'T

20:01.631 --> 20:04.274
A SUSPECT
IN A MURDER INVESTIGATION.

20:04.274 --> 20:05.735
( sighs )

20:10.340 --> 20:12.512
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD, MARK.
I'M SORRY.

20:12.512 --> 20:14.544
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO ABOUT DANNY.

20:14.544 --> 20:16.716
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BE
A GOOD MOM TO HIM.

20:16.716 --> 20:20.219
YOU'RE A WONDERFUL MOM.

20:20.219 --> 20:23.653
MARK, I SAID
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD.

20:26.526 --> 20:27.897
HOW CAN I HELP, KAREN?

20:27.897 --> 20:29.859
YOU CAN'T HELP.
I CAN'T HELP.

20:29.859 --> 20:32.302
NO ONE CAN.

20:32.302 --> 20:34.233
HE EVEN HAS AN ALIBI
AND HE WON'T USE IT.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.306
SO TAKE MATTERS
INTO YOUR OWN HANDS.

20:36.306 --> 20:38.668
YOU'RE THE PARENT.

20:38.668 --> 20:39.709
YOU NEED TO DO
WHAT YOU THINK

20:39.709 --> 20:40.840
IS RIGHT FOR HIM.

20:46.616 --> 20:47.947
CAN I AT LEAST
BRUSH YOUR HAIR?

20:47.947 --> 20:50.420
MARK, PLEASE DON'T
ASK ME THAT AGAIN.

20:50.420 --> 20:51.481
IT'S CREEPY.

20:53.783 --> 20:55.024
( sniffs )

20:55.024 --> 20:56.426
PUT THAT AWAY.

21:14.804 --> 21:16.676
HEY, LACE.

21:24.013 --> 21:26.786
NOW WAS THE FIRE PIT
YOURS OR JO'S IDEA?

21:26.786 --> 21:28.958
I DON'T REMEMBER.

21:28.958 --> 21:31.060
I THINK IT WAS JO'S.

21:31.060 --> 21:33.393
MAYBE.
I SHOULD GO.

21:33.393 --> 21:37.026
HEY, CAN YOU STAY
FOR A LITTLE BIT?

21:37.026 --> 21:39.369
I DIDN'T TELL, YOU KNOW...

21:39.369 --> 21:42.071
ABOUT OUR SLEEPOVER.

21:42.071 --> 21:44.604
I DIDN'T TELL
CHIEF MASTERSON

21:44.604 --> 21:47.337
ABOUT IT AND I ASKED JO
NOT TO SAY ANYTHING EITHER.

21:47.337 --> 21:50.410
I DON'T WANT TO MESS THINGS UP

21:50.410 --> 21:51.841
FOR, YOU KNOW,
YOU AND THAT GUY.

21:51.841 --> 21:52.982
HIS NAME'S ARCHIE.

21:52.982 --> 21:55.084
I KNOW.

21:55.084 --> 21:57.417
AND FOR THE RECORD,

21:57.417 --> 21:59.989
I NEVER WENT BACK
TO REGINA'S HOUSE.

22:02.051 --> 22:04.754
DO YOU BELIEVE ME?

22:04.754 --> 22:06.325
I DON'T KNOW.

22:07.927 --> 22:10.099
HOW YOU HANDLING
LOSING YOUR FRIEND?

22:10.099 --> 22:11.601
IT MUST BE ROUGH.

22:11.601 --> 22:12.762
I'M FINE.

22:13.733 --> 22:15.004
WHAT? YOU DON'T
BELIEVE ME?

22:15.004 --> 22:19.739
IF YOU'RE FINE,
THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE?

22:19.739 --> 22:23.042
THIS IS WHERE WE WENT
WHEN WE NEEDED TO UNLOAD,
YOU KNOW?

22:23.042 --> 22:25.044
TELL SECRETS, LAUGH,

22:25.044 --> 22:26.816
CRY.

22:26.816 --> 22:28.748
DID YOU REALLY THINK
I'M GONNA CRY IN FRONT OF YOU?

22:28.748 --> 22:30.950
NO.

22:30.950 --> 22:33.953
BUT MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TALK TO SOMEBODY.

22:33.953 --> 22:36.486
- YOU KNOW, LIKE A PROFESSIONAL.
- I TRIED THAT FIVE YEARS AGO.

22:36.486 --> 22:37.727
IT DIDN'T HELP MUCH.

22:41.791 --> 22:45.695
THIS PLACE IS IN PRETTY GOOD
CONDITION, CONSIDERING.

22:45.695 --> 22:47.737
YEAH, AFTER YOU WENT AWAY,
JO USED TO COME HERE.

22:49.969 --> 22:51.941
SHE DIDN'T WANT
THE PLACE TO FALL APART.

22:51.941 --> 22:54.844
YOU THINK SHE STILL
COMES HERE?

22:54.844 --> 23:00.009
SHE AND I HAVEN'T TALKED MUCH
IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS.

23:00.009 --> 23:01.811
BUT YOU KNOW JO.

23:01.811 --> 23:03.613
IT TAKES A LOT FOR HER
TO GIVE UP ON SOMETHING.

23:12.492 --> 23:15.965
HEY, YOUR DAD ISN'T HOME, IS HE?

23:15.965 --> 23:17.667
NO.

23:17.667 --> 23:18.928
HE'S WORKING LATE TONIGHT.

23:18.928 --> 23:19.999
BUT MY MOM'S GONNA
BE HOME ANY MINUTE,

23:19.999 --> 23:21.971
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT?

23:23.873 --> 23:25.034
I THINK HE WANTS
TO APOLOGIZE.

23:26.035 --> 23:27.937
JUST BASED ON BODY LANGUAGE

23:27.937 --> 23:29.709
AND THE WAY HE SAID, "HEY."

23:32.041 --> 23:34.484
I'M SORRY, JO.

23:34.484 --> 23:37.587
OKAY? MY FIGHT WITH ARCHIE

23:37.587 --> 23:38.748
WAS STUPID.
IT WAS REALLY STUPID.

23:38.748 --> 23:41.551
- EXTREMELY STUPID.
- EXTREMELY STUPID.

23:41.551 --> 23:42.992
AND I KNOW HOW SECRETIVE
I'M BEING

23:42.992 --> 23:45.424
AND HOW COMPLICATED
I'M MAKING YOUR LIFE,

23:45.424 --> 23:47.857
BUT JUST PLEASE DON'T
GIVE UP ON ME JUST YET.

23:52.001 --> 23:53.733
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

23:53.733 --> 23:55.465
HE WAS JUST STOPPING BY
FOR A MINUTE.

23:56.836 --> 24:00.640
ACTUALLY, I WAS GOING TO INVITE
YOU AND JO OVER TO MY PLACE

24:00.640 --> 24:01.671
FOR DINNER TONIGHT.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.914
TONIGHT?

24:04.914 --> 24:07.777
- DANNY, I DON'T--
- MOM, JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

24:07.777 --> 24:08.818
I MEAN IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M ASKING

24:08.818 --> 24:10.680
TO GO HANG OUT
WITH HIM BY MYSELF.

24:10.680 --> 24:12.852
YOU AND MRS. DESAI
WILL BE THERE.

24:12.852 --> 24:14.684
SOUNDS LIKE A
DELIGHTFUL EVENING.

24:14.684 --> 24:15.785
YOU'RE INVITED TOO.

24:15.785 --> 24:17.757
REALLY?
THANKS, MAN.

24:19.889 --> 24:21.731
Tess: YOU THINK
HE'S GONNA KILL US ALL

24:21.731 --> 24:23.963
- OVER A PASTA DINNER?
- Kyle: Very funny.

24:23.963 --> 24:26.195
FOR THE RECORD, I THINK
THIS IS A TERRIBLE IDEA.

24:26.195 --> 24:28.998
DULY RECORDED.
LOVE YOU.

24:28.998 --> 24:29.969
BYE.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.471
( door opens )

24:34.143 --> 24:35.875
MY NEXT TEEN INTERVIEWEE HERE?

24:35.875 --> 24:36.976
YEAH, BUT SOMEONE ELSE

24:36.976 --> 24:38.678
WOULD LIKE
TO TALK TO YOU FIRST.

24:42.081 --> 24:43.783
KAREN,

24:43.783 --> 24:45.985
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT.

24:45.985 --> 24:49.188
SO I HEAR YOU'RE HOSTING
A LITTLE DINNER PARTY TONIGHT.

24:49.188 --> 24:51.821
YEAH, I JUST
FOUND THAT OUT MYSELF.

24:51.821 --> 24:53.823
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

24:53.823 --> 24:55.995
DANNY WASN'T ALONE
THE NIGHT REGINA WAS MURDERED.

24:55.995 --> 24:59.869
SO YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT YOU AND DANNY STAYED UP

24:59.869 --> 25:01.901
ALL NIGHT EATING BONBONS
AND GABBING?

25:01.901 --> 25:04.974
I WAS ASLEEP, BUT I DO KNOW
THAT LACEY SPENT THE NIGHT.

25:04.974 --> 25:07.977
I SAW HER LEAVING
THE NEXT MORNING.

25:07.977 --> 25:10.980
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,
DO YOU?

25:10.980 --> 25:13.012
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
- WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

25:13.012 --> 25:15.985
IT DOESN'T FIT WITH THE
"MY SON'S A MONSTER THEORY"

25:15.985 --> 25:18.017
THAT YOU AND THIS WHOLE TOWN
WANT SO BADLY TO BELIEVE.

25:18.017 --> 25:19.919
THERE IS ACTUAL EVIDENCE.

25:19.919 --> 25:22.652
WHAT? ONE TEXT FROM A DRUNK GIRL

25:22.652 --> 25:25.054
CLAIMING TO KNOW ABOUT SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENED FIVE YEARS AGO?

25:25.054 --> 25:27.296
SO DANNY TOLD YOU.

25:27.296 --> 25:29.829
I KNOW HE'S AN EASY
TARGET, BUT PLEASE...

25:29.829 --> 25:31.561
DON'T RUIN HIS LIFE NOW

25:31.561 --> 25:33.032
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE STILL
HOLDING A GRUDGE.

25:33.032 --> 25:35.034
I DON'T HOLD GRUDGES, KAREN.

25:35.034 --> 25:37.036
THAT'S YOUR DEPARTMENT.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.938
WHILE YOU'RE HERE,

25:38.938 --> 25:42.041
THIS NECKLACE LOOK FAMILIAR?

25:46.545 --> 25:49.278
NO, IT DOESN'T.
WHY?

25:49.278 --> 25:52.622
IT WAS THE ONLY THING
TAKEN FROM REGINA'S BODY.

25:52.622 --> 25:54.924
IN FACT, IT WAS
THE ONLY THING MISSING
FROM THE WHOLE HOUSE.

25:54.924 --> 25:56.555
I'VE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.157
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

25:58.157 --> 25:59.659
I'VE A DINNER TO PREPARE.

26:06.235 --> 26:07.266
WELL?

26:07.266 --> 26:08.297
HOW'D IT GO?

26:08.297 --> 26:09.568
LET'S JUST SAY
SHE DOESN'T HAVE

26:09.568 --> 26:11.601
AS GOOD A POKER FACE
AS HER SON.

26:15.905 --> 26:19.108
SO TONIGHT IS A CHANCE TO TALK

26:19.108 --> 26:21.651
ABOUT REGINA,
SHARE MEMORIES,

26:21.651 --> 26:22.782
AND...

26:22.782 --> 26:25.254
SORRY I'M LATE.

26:25.254 --> 26:26.886
THAT'S OKAY, LACEY.

26:26.886 --> 26:27.917
I'M SO GLAD

26:27.917 --> 26:28.988
YOU'RE ABLE TO JOIN US.

26:30.660 --> 26:33.022
I KNEW YOU'D
DECIDE TO COME, BABE.

26:33.022 --> 26:34.994
THANKS FOR SUPPORTING ME.

26:34.994 --> 26:36.826
LET'S BEGIN.

26:36.826 --> 26:40.069
I AM HONORED TO INTRODUCE

26:40.069 --> 26:41.270
A SPECIAL GUEST.

26:41.270 --> 26:43.803
SHE GRADUATED

26:43.803 --> 26:45.875
MAGNA CUM LAUDE

26:45.875 --> 26:47.907
FROM GREEN GROVE
JUNIOR COLLEGE

26:47.907 --> 26:49.809
AND SHE IS A CERTIFIED

26:49.809 --> 26:51.711
GRIEF SPECIALIST.

26:51.711 --> 26:54.343
WELCOME, APRIL TANAKA.

26:54.343 --> 26:56.946
( clapping )

26:56.946 --> 26:58.918
THANK YOU.

26:58.918 --> 27:00.890
WOW.

27:00.890 --> 27:03.022
GRIEF.

27:03.022 --> 27:06.155
TO MOST PEOPLE WHO'VE NEVER
EXPERIENCED IT BEFORE,

27:06.155 --> 27:08.257
IT'S JUST A FIVE LETTER WORD.

27:08.257 --> 27:09.899
RIGHT?

27:09.899 --> 27:13.803
THREE CONSONANTS
AND TWO VOWELS.

27:13.803 --> 27:16.966
BUT TO EVERYONE HERE
WHO KNEW AND LOVED REGINA,

27:16.966 --> 27:22.011
IT'S MORE THAN JUST A WORD.
IT'S A WEIGHT...

27:22.011 --> 27:25.044
ON OUR HEARTS.

27:25.044 --> 27:26.976
- ( bubbling )
- ( door opens )

27:26.976 --> 27:28.177
( door closes )

27:29.378 --> 27:31.781
THANK GOD YOU'RE BACK.
I NEED SOME HELP.

27:31.781 --> 27:33.322
COOKING FOR FIVE AT HOME

27:33.322 --> 27:34.824
IS ODDLY MORE STRESSFUL

27:34.824 --> 27:36.055
THAN COOKING FOR 30
IN JUVIE.

27:36.055 --> 27:38.287
DANNY,

27:38.287 --> 27:40.990
CAN WE TALK?

27:40.990 --> 27:44.033
IT'S ABOUT THIS INVESTIGATION.

27:44.033 --> 27:46.996
UH, SURE.
WHAT ABOUT IT?

27:46.996 --> 27:49.869
( doorbell rings )

27:49.869 --> 27:51.801
OOH, UH, OKAY.
CAN YOU WATCH THAT?

28:00.850 --> 28:03.012
DINNER SMELLS GREAT.

28:03.012 --> 28:04.914
I BROUGHT PINOT.

28:17.266 --> 28:19.268
A HEADS-UP
WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE.

28:19.268 --> 28:21.801
HE DECIDED TO COME
AT THE LAST MINUTE.

28:21.801 --> 28:24.333
- DIDN'T YOU GET MY TEXT?
- NO, I WAS COOKING--

28:24.333 --> 28:27.807
APPARENTLY FOR THE MAN
WHO WANTS TO PIN
A MURDER ON ME.

28:27.807 --> 28:30.039
- WHY'D HE EVEN COME?
- I DON'T KNOW.

28:30.039 --> 28:32.281
MAYBE MY MOM CONVINCED HIM
TO LIGHTEN UP A BIT.

28:32.281 --> 28:34.113
WHATEVER. HE'S HERE,
SO CHARM HIM.

28:34.113 --> 28:35.184
YOU'RE REALLY GOOD AT THAT.

28:36.245 --> 28:39.288
- CAN I HELP SET UP?
- NO THANKS, SIR.

28:39.288 --> 28:41.050
ACTUALLY, WE GOT IT COVERED,
BUT THANK YOU.

28:41.050 --> 28:42.822
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME, DANNY.

28:42.822 --> 28:45.294
YEAH, THIS PLACE
HASN'T CHANGED AT ALL.

28:45.294 --> 28:47.256
IT'S LIKE GOING
BACK IN TIME.

28:47.256 --> 28:48.998
YEAH, MY MOTHER
ISN'T BIG ON CHANGE.

28:48.998 --> 28:50.459
WELL, I GET IT.
CHANGE IS HARD.

28:50.459 --> 28:52.431
BUT NECESSARY.

28:52.431 --> 28:54.433
IF YOU SPEND TOO MUCH TIME
TRYING TO RECREATE THE PAST,

28:54.433 --> 28:56.335
YOU CAN MISS WHAT'S
HAPPENING IN THE PRESENT.

28:56.335 --> 28:58.737
I AGREE, DAD.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.369
BUT IF YOU SPEND TOO MUCH TIME
OBSESSING

29:00.369 --> 29:03.412
OVER THE PAST OR SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST,

29:03.412 --> 29:05.074
YOU CAN LOSE FOCUS
ON THE PRESENT SITUATION.

29:09.819 --> 29:11.350
REFILL ON THE WINE, SIR?

29:11.350 --> 29:13.222
SURE.

29:13.222 --> 29:14.323
I NEED TO USE
THE RESTROOM.

29:14.323 --> 29:16.926
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

29:16.926 --> 29:18.988
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

29:18.988 --> 29:20.359
LET'S JUST
GET THROUGH TONIGHT, OKAY.

29:20.359 --> 29:21.791
I'LL GET HIM
HIS WINE.

29:46.255 --> 29:48.287
GET LOST
FINDING THE BATHROOM?

29:48.287 --> 29:51.320
SORRY, I PASSED YOUR ROOM

29:51.320 --> 29:52.922
AND SAW THIS PHOTO.

29:52.922 --> 29:55.194
I THINK I TOOK THIS ONE.

29:55.194 --> 29:58.998
MY DAD TOOK
THAT PHOTO, ACTUALLY.

30:08.377 --> 30:10.379
DO YOU NEED HELP
FINDING THE BATHROOM?

30:10.379 --> 30:13.342
NO, I GOT IT, DANNY.
THANKS.

30:13.342 --> 30:16.085
YOU'RE WELCOME.
DINNER'S READY.

30:16.085 --> 30:18.587
GREAT.
I'M STARVING.

30:28.858 --> 30:32.531
SO SHE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT BORON WAS.

30:32.531 --> 30:35.364
SO I TOLD HER.

30:35.364 --> 30:38.007
AND SHE WAS ALL LIKE
"I LIKE YOU.

30:38.007 --> 30:40.239
I WANT TO MAKE YOU
MY NERD PET."

30:40.239 --> 30:42.912
BUT I NEVER GOT TO BE
HER NERD PET.

30:42.912 --> 30:46.515
YOU KNOW?
I NEVER GOT THAT CHANCE.

30:46.515 --> 30:49.078
YOU WERE HER NERD PET, DOUG.

30:49.078 --> 30:53.282
YOU WILL ALWAYS BE
HER NERD PET.

30:53.282 --> 30:55.284
THANK YOU.

30:55.284 --> 30:57.326
April: THANK YOU.

30:57.326 --> 31:00.159
HOW ABOUT YOU?

31:00.159 --> 31:05.864
( clears throat )
WELL, THIS ONE TIME

31:05.864 --> 31:07.166
I WAS HUNGRY.

31:07.166 --> 31:09.368
AND I TOLD REGINA THAT.

31:09.368 --> 31:12.241
AND THEN SHE GAVE ME
HER RAISINS.

31:14.073 --> 31:15.874
THAT'S IT.

31:18.307 --> 31:20.879
SERIOUSLY?

31:20.879 --> 31:22.651
WHAT? YOU KNOW
I LIKE RAISINS.

31:22.651 --> 31:24.613
IF REGINA COULD,

31:24.613 --> 31:28.157
SHE WOULD TOSS YOU
A BOX OF RAISINS

31:28.157 --> 31:29.218
FROM HEAVEN RIGHT NOW.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.521
THANK YOU.

31:32.521 --> 31:34.593
April: ( sighs )

31:34.593 --> 31:36.565
HOW ABOUT YOU?

31:36.565 --> 31:38.597
IT'S LACEY, RIGHT?

31:38.597 --> 31:41.000
I THINK I'LL PASS
IF THAT'S OKAY.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.371
OKAY.

31:42.371 --> 31:44.103
WHENEVER YOUR
HEART IS READY.

31:48.137 --> 31:50.239
HOW ABOUT YOU, PHOEBE?
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE?

31:50.239 --> 31:54.313
UM, MY MIND KEEPS
TAKING ME BACK

31:54.313 --> 31:57.346
TO A SLEEPOVER
REGINA AND I HAD

31:57.346 --> 31:58.387
IN THE 8th GRADE.

31:58.387 --> 32:00.349
WE WOULD STAY UP ALL NIGHT,

32:00.349 --> 32:01.590
TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING.

32:01.590 --> 32:03.252
BOYS, LOVE,

32:03.252 --> 32:05.995
ANIMALS, CLOTHES,
THE JONAS BROTHERS.

32:05.995 --> 32:08.357
THAT'S WHEN THEY WERE
SORT OF STILL RELEVANT.

32:10.399 --> 32:13.932
THAT WAS THE NIGHT
THAT I KNEW

32:13.932 --> 32:16.665
REGINA WOULD BE MY SOUL MATE...

32:16.665 --> 32:18.637
- FOREVER.
- I'M SORRY.

32:18.637 --> 32:20.469
BUT THIS IS ALL
SUCH TOTAL CRAP!

32:20.469 --> 32:22.641
EXCUSE ME, BUT WE DON'T
INTERRUPT

32:22.641 --> 32:24.013
WHEN OTHERS ARE SHARING.

32:24.013 --> 32:25.644
DID ANYONE HERE
ACTUALLY KNOW REGINA?

32:25.644 --> 32:27.176
DONNA,

32:27.176 --> 32:28.377
YOU SPOKE TO HER-- WHAT?
LIKE TWICE?

32:28.377 --> 32:29.648
SHANE,

32:29.648 --> 32:31.480
ALL YOU DID WAS HIT ON HER
AT PARTIES.

32:31.480 --> 32:33.352
SHE THOUGHT YOU WERE CREEPY
AND GROSS.

32:33.352 --> 32:35.324
DOUG, YOU WEREN'T
HER ONLY NERD PET.

32:35.324 --> 32:37.356
SHE PICKED ONE
IN EVERY CLASS

32:37.356 --> 32:39.258
AND CALLED HIM HER PET
JUST SO THAT HE'D DO
HER HOMEWORK FOR HER.

32:39.258 --> 32:41.290
- OH.
- AND YOU.

32:41.290 --> 32:43.292
YOU AND REGINA HATED EACH OTHER.

32:43.292 --> 32:45.194
YOU TALKED BEHIND
EACH OTHER'S BACKS.

32:45.194 --> 32:46.465
YOU MOCKED EACH OTHER'S
CLOTHES.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.137
AND AFTER YOU HAD THAT
BIG FALLING OUT LAST YEAR,

32:48.137 --> 32:49.398
YOU BROKE INTO HER CAR

32:49.398 --> 32:51.400
AND PUT A FISH IN
HER GLOVE COMPARTMENT.

32:51.400 --> 32:54.243
HER CAR SMELLED FOR MONTHS.

32:54.243 --> 32:56.375
SO WHERE THE HELL DO YOU GET OFF
CALLING HER YOUR SOUL MATE?

33:05.354 --> 33:08.517
SO LOKI IS JUST WATCHING
IRON MAN AND THOR BATTLE.

33:08.517 --> 33:10.419
AND THEN CAPTAIN AMERICA
SWOOPS IN.

33:10.419 --> 33:12.321
IT'S JUST CRAZY.

33:12.321 --> 33:14.623
YEAH,
THAT SOUNDS CRAZY.

33:14.623 --> 33:16.165
YEAH, YOU'D LOVE IT.

33:16.165 --> 33:18.167
HEY, WE SHOULD RENT IT.
WE CAN SHOW DANNY THE SCENE

33:18.167 --> 33:20.229
THAT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS
FILMED IN McNALLY PARK.

33:20.229 --> 33:22.301
DANNY, HAVE YOU EVEN SEEN
THE NEW McNALLY PARK?

33:22.301 --> 33:24.473
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THERE WAS
A NEW McNALLY PARK.

33:24.473 --> 33:26.275
WELL, THEY RENOVATED IT
LAST YEAR.

33:26.275 --> 33:28.177
WE SHOULD CHECK IT OUT.

33:29.378 --> 33:31.180
YEAH, THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

33:31.180 --> 33:32.281
UH, SATURDAY NIGHT?

33:32.281 --> 33:34.443
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

33:35.344 --> 33:37.416
AND WHY IS THAT?

33:37.416 --> 33:39.448
I'M NOT SURE
IT WOULD BE SAFE.

33:39.448 --> 33:41.390
AH.

33:41.390 --> 33:45.124
YOU MEAN IT WOULDN'T BE SAFE
WITH MY SON THERE.

33:45.124 --> 33:48.357
KAREN,
THAT'S NOT WHAT HE MEANT.

33:48.357 --> 33:50.059
IT'S JUST NOT APPROPRIATE

33:50.059 --> 33:51.560
TO LET YOUR KID
GO TO A PARK AT NIGHT.

33:51.560 --> 33:55.264
YOU KNOW, SEXUAL PREDATORS.

33:57.336 --> 33:58.537
WELL, THANK YOU, TESS,
FOR THAT

33:58.537 --> 34:00.269
LECTURE ON
APPROPRIATE PARENTING.

34:00.269 --> 34:02.271
I'M NOT SURE

34:02.271 --> 34:03.712
THERE'S MUCH OF A SEX CRIME
PROBLEM IN GREEN GROVE.

34:03.712 --> 34:05.444
THERE'S A BIT OF
A MURDER PROBLEM.

34:05.444 --> 34:06.375
DAD!

34:07.746 --> 34:09.748
SAY IT, KYLE.

34:09.748 --> 34:12.181
YOU THINK MY SON'S
A PSYCHOPATHIC MURDERER.

34:15.454 --> 34:17.586
KAREN, EVERYONE'S
TRYING TO DEAL

34:17.586 --> 34:19.358
WITH A VERY
DIFFICULT SITUATION.

34:19.358 --> 34:21.530
YEAH WELL, A SITUATION
YOU BLAME ON ME.

34:21.530 --> 34:23.462
OKAY, UH, MOTHER.

34:23.462 --> 34:24.663
I THINK YOU'VE
HAD ENOUGH WINE.

34:24.663 --> 34:27.136
DANNY, YOU WANTED THIS DINNER.
WELL, HERE IT IS.

34:27.136 --> 34:28.667
I DON'T BLAME YOU
FOR ANYTHING.

34:28.667 --> 34:30.699
REALLY?

34:30.699 --> 34:32.471
THEN WHY DID YOU CALL ME
A BAD MOTHER?

34:32.471 --> 34:34.243
THAT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO.

34:34.243 --> 34:35.304
AND WHAT YOU WERE
ASKING OF US

34:35.304 --> 34:36.845
WAS COMPLETELY UNREASONABLE.

34:36.845 --> 34:38.377
WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

34:41.310 --> 34:42.651
MY LATE HUSBAND AND I WANTED

34:42.651 --> 34:44.483
YOUR PARENTS TO LET YOU
BE A CHARACTER WITNESS

34:44.483 --> 34:45.614
AT DANNY'S SENTENCING.

34:48.287 --> 34:51.390
AND THEY TURNED US DOWN.

34:51.390 --> 34:55.494
JO WAS ELEVEN, KAREN.
WE WERE JUST TRYING

34:55.494 --> 34:57.396
TO PROTECT OUR DAUGHTER.

34:57.396 --> 34:59.268
AND I WAS TRYING
TO HELP MY SON.

34:59.268 --> 35:01.530
I KNOW WHAT DANNY DID.

35:01.530 --> 35:02.601
IT WAS--

35:02.601 --> 35:05.434
BUT JO KNEW DANNY,
THE REAL DANNY,

35:05.434 --> 35:07.476
SINCE HE WAS A BABY.
AND HER TESTIMONY MIGHT
HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE.

35:07.476 --> 35:09.208
IT WOULD HAVE MADE
NO DIFFERENCE!

35:09.208 --> 35:11.480
I LOST MY SON FOR FIVE YEARS!

35:11.480 --> 35:13.382
HE'S LUCKY HE GOT FIVE YEARS!

35:32.261 --> 35:34.233
MY PARENTS LEFT.

35:34.233 --> 35:35.804
THEY'RE GIVING RICO
A RIDE HOME.

35:35.804 --> 35:37.306
THEY LEFT THEIR
DAUGHTER BEHIND

35:37.306 --> 35:39.308
WITH A PSYCHOPATHIC
MURDERER?

35:39.308 --> 35:42.541
THAT'S VERY IRRESPONSIBLE.

35:42.541 --> 35:44.773
I INSISTED ON WALKING HOME.

35:44.773 --> 35:46.275
MY DAD WASN'T REALLY
HAPPY ABOUT IT.

35:46.275 --> 35:49.418
TRY NOT TO KILL ME, OKAY.

35:49.418 --> 35:52.481
IT'LL MAKE ME LOOK REALLY BAD
IN FRONT OF MY PARENTS.

35:52.481 --> 35:53.652
I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND.

35:57.286 --> 35:59.558
IS THIS THE SAME...

35:59.558 --> 36:02.331
YEAH.

36:02.331 --> 36:03.632
YEAH, I GUESS IT IS.

36:06.235 --> 36:08.337
YOUR MOM REALLY DOES
HATE CHANGE.

36:09.898 --> 36:13.272
OH, I VISITED OUR FORT TODAY.

36:13.272 --> 36:16.645
IT'S IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE,
YOU KNOW, AFTER FIVE YEARS
OF NEGLECT.

36:16.645 --> 36:19.448
YEAH, I CHECK ON IT
FROM TIME TO TIME.

36:19.448 --> 36:22.511
YEAH, I KNOW.
LACEY TOLD ME.

36:22.511 --> 36:24.253
SHE DID? WHEN?

36:24.253 --> 36:25.814
TODAY, AT THE FORT.

36:25.814 --> 36:28.317
SHE WAS THERE?

36:28.317 --> 36:29.388
HEY, I WAS JUST AS
SURPRISED AS YOU ARE.

36:29.388 --> 36:33.262
YET SHE STILL
WON'T TELL ANYONE

36:33.262 --> 36:35.224
SHE WAS WITH YOU
THE NIGHT REGINA DIED.

36:38.267 --> 36:40.198
I DIDN'T KNOW,
BY THE WAY,

36:40.198 --> 36:43.302
ABOUT THE CHARACTER
WITNESS THING.

36:43.302 --> 36:45.574
THEY NEVER ASKED ME.

36:45.574 --> 36:48.677
IF THEY HAD,
WOULD YOU HAVE SAID YES?

36:48.677 --> 36:49.778
OF COURSE.

36:50.879 --> 36:52.811
OKAY, MAYBE NOT.

36:55.344 --> 36:57.316
YOUR DAD WAS RIGHT.

36:57.316 --> 36:59.318
IT WOULDN'T HAVE
MATTERED ANYWAY.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.492
SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
ABOUT HIM NOW?

37:03.492 --> 37:04.993
HE STILL HATES ME.

37:04.993 --> 37:07.696
I DON'T CARE.

37:07.696 --> 37:10.359
ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS PROVE TO HIM

37:10.359 --> 37:11.530
THAT SOMEONE ELSE
KILLED REGINA.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.804
I COULDN'T HELP YOU
FIVE YEARS AGO,

37:15.804 --> 37:17.306
BUT I CAN NOW.

37:34.783 --> 37:36.885
HEY.

37:36.885 --> 37:39.027
THE GRIEF SESSION
JUST FINISHED UP.

37:39.027 --> 37:40.959
GREAT.

37:40.959 --> 37:46.535
PHOEBE, I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE
FOR MY LITTLE FREAK OUT.

37:46.535 --> 37:48.797
I KIND OF NEEDED
TO BLOW OFF SOME STEAM.

37:52.501 --> 37:53.702
DID REGINA EVER TELL YOU

37:53.702 --> 37:55.304
WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN US?

37:55.304 --> 37:57.376
SOMETHING TO DO
WITH CRAIG BENTLEY.

37:57.376 --> 38:03.051
I TOLD HER THAT
I HAD A CRUSH ON CRAIG.

38:03.051 --> 38:05.784
SO SHE WENT AND TOLD HIM

38:05.784 --> 38:07.786
THAT I HAD AN STD,

38:07.786 --> 38:10.319
SOMETHING YUCKY,

38:10.319 --> 38:12.661
SOMETHING IN MY BUTT.

38:12.661 --> 38:15.023
WHICH I DON'T HAVE.
I HAVEN'T EVEN HAD SEX.

38:15.023 --> 38:17.025
I MEAN I KIND OF
WENT TO THIRD BASE--

38:17.025 --> 38:18.827
OKAY, I BELIEVE YOU.
I BELIEVE YOU.

38:18.827 --> 38:19.828
ANYWAY.

38:19.828 --> 38:22.471
WHEN I CONFRONTED REGINA
ABOUT IT,

38:22.471 --> 38:26.635
SHE CLAIMED THAT SHE LIKED
CRAIG SEVEN MONTHS AGO

38:26.635 --> 38:30.038
FOR THREE-AND-A-HALF WEEKS AND
THAT HE WAS OFF-LIMITS TO ME.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.313
OUR FRIENDSHIP WAS OVER.

38:35.313 --> 38:38.917
GOD, IT SOUNDS
SO DUMB NOW.

38:38.917 --> 38:40.989
AND CRAIG BENTLEY
ISN'T EVEN THAT CUTE.

38:45.023 --> 38:48.056
MY LAST INTERACTION WITH REGINA
WASN'T SO GREAT EITHER.

38:48.056 --> 38:49.528
WHAT HAPPENED?

38:49.528 --> 38:52.330
I WAS AT HER PARTY.
SHE EMBARRASSED ME IN FRONT OF--

38:52.330 --> 38:54.703
SOMEONE.

38:54.703 --> 38:55.764
I CALLED HER OUT.

38:55.764 --> 38:57.005
SHE TOLD ME NOT
TO BE SO SENSITIVE.

38:57.005 --> 38:58.036
AND THEN SHE WALKED AWAY.

38:58.036 --> 39:03.111
AND THAT'S THE LAST TIME
WE SPOKE.

39:03.111 --> 39:06.945
REGINA KNEW
THAT YOU LOVED HER.

39:06.945 --> 39:10.048
I HOPE SO.

39:10.048 --> 39:11.520
SHE DID.

39:11.520 --> 39:13.752
YOU WERE HER BEST FRIEND.

39:13.752 --> 39:16.054
I WAS ALWAYS KIND OF JEALOUS

39:16.054 --> 39:17.656
OF YOUR GUYS' FRIENDSHIP.

39:17.656 --> 39:19.858
I EVEN TRIED
TO TURN HER AGAINST
YOU A COUPLE TIMES,

39:19.858 --> 39:22.391
BUT IT DIDN'T TAKE.

39:27.536 --> 39:28.967
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

39:28.967 --> 39:31.470
TO THE DINER.
I NEED TO DO SOME HOMEWORK.

39:31.470 --> 39:33.472
OKAY.

39:33.472 --> 39:35.544
WHEN YOU GET BACK,
WE STILL NEED

39:35.544 --> 39:36.545
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION.

39:36.545 --> 39:38.407
ABOUT WHAT?

39:38.407 --> 39:40.078
HOW YOU HAD A COMPLETE
FREAK-OUT AT DINNER?

39:40.078 --> 39:42.581
I'M SORRY, BUT I DON'T LIKE
TO BE MADE TO FEEL

39:42.581 --> 39:44.713
LIKE A BAD PERSON
IN MY OWN HOME, OKAY?

39:44.713 --> 39:45.954
KYLE AND TESS--

39:45.954 --> 39:47.716
KYLE AND TESS
ARE NOT THE PROBLEM!

39:47.716 --> 39:50.719
OKAY? IT'S MY FAULT.

39:50.719 --> 39:53.662
I SPENT FIVE YEARS
IN JUVIE, MOTHER.

39:53.662 --> 39:58.166
NOT JO'S, NOT KYLE'S,
NOT TESS'S, MINE.

40:14.042 --> 40:15.944
Kyle: YOU TOOK LONG ENOUGH.

40:15.944 --> 40:18.947
I WAS ABOUT TO DRIVE
AROUND LOOKING FOR YOU.

40:18.947 --> 40:21.620
SORRY, I JUST NEEDED SOME AIR.

40:25.924 --> 40:27.125
JO...

40:27.125 --> 40:29.858
ABOUT THAT DINNER.

40:29.858 --> 40:31.760
I DIDN'T INTEND
TO CAUSE A SCENE.

40:31.760 --> 40:35.103
HEY, IT'S PRETTY MUCH

40:35.103 --> 40:37.866
A MASS PARENTAL
MELTDOWN ANYWAY.

40:40.038 --> 40:41.940
AND ABOUT WHAT
KAREN TOLD YOU--

40:41.940 --> 40:43.712
IT'S OKAY.

40:43.712 --> 40:45.574
I KNOW YOU AND MOM
WERE JUST PROTECTING ME.

40:45.574 --> 40:49.077
AND YOU KNOW THAT'S ALL
I'M TRYING TO DO NOW TOO, RIGHT?

40:49.077 --> 40:51.680
YOU'RE MY BABY.

40:56.555 --> 40:58.156
BUT I'M NOT A BABY ANYMORE.

40:58.156 --> 41:00.489
AND I'M NOT BACKING
AWAY FROM DANNY.

41:00.489 --> 41:03.231
IT DOESN'T MATTER

41:03.231 --> 41:05.093
THAT YOU THINK
HE DID IT, OR WHY.

41:05.093 --> 41:06.895
I BELIEVE IN HIM, DAD.

41:06.895 --> 41:08.797
YOU ALWAYS TAUGHT ME
TO FOLLOW WHAT I BELIEVE.

41:18.106 --> 41:20.008
( kettle whistles )

41:25.083 --> 41:27.816
I THOUGHT WE MADE IT PAST
THE REBELLIOUS TEENAGE PHASE

41:27.816 --> 41:29.257
UNSCATHED.

41:29.257 --> 41:32.090
SHE'S RELATED TO YOU,
KYLE.

41:32.090 --> 41:34.122
SHE WAS BOUND TO GO
ROGUE EVENTUALLY.

41:34.122 --> 41:36.094
THAT DINNER PARTY
WAS FUN, HUH?

41:36.094 --> 41:38.226
( sighs ) JUST LIKE
THE GOOD OLD DAYS.

41:38.226 --> 41:41.499
ISN'T IT STRANGE HOW SIMILAR
THAT HOUSE LOOKED?

41:41.499 --> 41:44.072
IT'S LIKE KAREN HASN'T
ALTERED A SINGLE PLANT.

41:44.072 --> 41:46.074
I KNOW.

41:46.074 --> 41:48.006
DID YOU SEE THAT PHOTO?

41:48.006 --> 41:50.108
WHEN WE GOT THERE,

41:50.108 --> 41:51.509
I NOTICED A SHELF
OF FAMILY PHOTOS.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.181
AND THERE WAS ONE
WITH TARA DESAI IN IT.

41:53.181 --> 41:55.113
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

41:55.113 --> 41:57.045
THE WEIRDEST PART WAS
WHEN WE LEFT,

41:57.045 --> 41:58.847
I PASSED THE SHELF AGAIN
AND THE PHOTO WITH TARA

41:58.847 --> 42:00.248
WAS GONE.

42:00.248 --> 42:02.791
STRANGE, HUH?

42:02.791 --> 42:05.093
MAYBE KAREN
OR DANNY MOVED IT.

42:05.093 --> 42:09.127
MAYBE THEY SAW IT
AND WERE EMBARRASSED

42:09.127 --> 42:11.600
IT WAS SITTING OUT
LIKE THAT.

42:11.600 --> 42:13.301
MAYBE.
