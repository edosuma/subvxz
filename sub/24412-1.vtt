Ah!

Ah!

Ah!

02:20.031 --> 02:23.999
<i>The tomatoes go in the refrigerator
and the bananas go in the fruit bowl.</i>

02:24.009 --> 02:28.390
<i>I do some of the grocery shopping,
and always do the tomatoes first.</i>

02:28.425 --> 02:30.866
<i>We don't ask for information.</i>

02:30.936 --> 02:33.029
<i>You say that's it?
That's the only problem.</i>

02:33.039 --> 02:36.999
<i>People will do that, the tomato crop,
tomato prices will be part of the deal.</i>

02:37.009 --> 02:39.988
<i>Well, I thought that they'll have
a much better product, yeah.</i>

02:39.999 --> 02:45.039
<i>But this lot will grow in the back yard,
pick 'em whenever you want.</i>

02:48.008 --> 02:50.967
<i>If you want to eat tomatoes
12 months out of the year,</i>

02:50.976 --> 02:53.924
<i>you're gonna have to pick 'em
at one of these two stations.</i>

03:50.108 --> 03:52.139

05:52.067 --> 05:54.025

<i>Let me hear your voice</i>

06:36.970 --> 06:41.127
<i>Hold me, hold me near you</i>

06:43.074 --> 06:47.949
<i>It's your choice, oh, Lord</i>

07:18.104 --> 07:21.091
<i>- Hello. You've reached...

07:21.102 --> 07:23.103
<i>After the tone,
please leave a message.</i>

07:25.081 --> 07:27.081
It's done.

08:39.951 --> 08:41.878
Just go inside.

08:41.888 --> 08:44.065
- What?
- Go inside. Just go, just go.

08:44.075 --> 08:46.929
<i>$300? You parasite!</i>

08:48.897 --> 08:50.107
Mom, I'm back.

08:50.118 --> 08:53.106
<i>50, 60, 70,</i>

08:53.117 --> 08:55.096
<i>75.</i>

08:55.106 --> 08:59.876
<i>I'm not wealthy.
I'm just a woman with $75.</i>

09:07.022 --> 09:08.876
Hey.

09:12.979 --> 09:14.980
Excited to see me, huh?

09:31.947 --> 09:33.947
You actually got me.

09:33.957 --> 09:36.874
- I got you.
- Yeah, pretty good.

09:36.884 --> 09:38.061
Got you, got you!

09:38.071 --> 09:40.081
What is this shit you're watching?

09:40.092 --> 09:42.092
Oh...

09:43.894 --> 09:45.894
Psycho was on today.

09:47.071 --> 09:49.029
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:49.040 --> 09:52.915
That scared me.
Oh, boy, it scared me.

09:52.925 --> 09:54.882
Then why are you watching it alone?

09:54.893 --> 09:57.935
I don't know.
I should've waited for you.

10:01.965 --> 10:03.966
Ohh...

10:13.923 --> 10:15.870
- Joe?
- Yeah?

10:15.880 --> 10:17.902
Would you just stay a little bit?

10:18.953 --> 10:20.964
Just stay.

10:20.974 --> 10:22.902
- Okay.
- Just...

10:22.913 --> 10:25.048
Cos you watched some scary,
fucking movie?

10:25.059 --> 10:27.058
Just till I've finished the movie.

11:45.063 --> 11:47.927
Joe?

11:47.937 --> 11:50.915
Uh?

11:50.926 --> 11:53.010
Mom?

11:53.020 --> 11:54.967
Yeah?

11:54.978 --> 11:56.999
I can't turn the tap off!

11:59.894 --> 12:01.978
Oh, I don't have any of the...

12:03.071 --> 12:05.905
I can't find anything.

12:05.915 --> 12:08.102
- What are you looking for?
- I can't find my toothbrush.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.935
It's right behind the mirror.

12:10.945 --> 12:12.050
Wait...

12:12.060 --> 12:14.102
Oh, oh, okay.

12:18.070 --> 12:20.861
Mom? Come on!

12:20.871 --> 12:23.081
- Let's go. I'm opening.
- No, no, no, no! Stop that!

12:23.091 --> 12:25.101
- Just let me...
- I'm opening the door.

12:25.862 --> 12:27.038
No, no, no!

12:27.049 --> 12:29.912
What are you doing?
What are you fucking around with?

12:29.923 --> 12:32.048
- There's water everywhere!
- I'm not fucking around!

12:32.058 --> 12:35.007
You are! There's nothing.
You keep rearranging... Get out.

12:35.017 --> 12:36.944
I need my space!

12:36.955 --> 12:38.924
- Your what?
- My space.

12:38.934 --> 12:41.079
Alright. Go get your space downstairs.

12:41.089 --> 12:43.037
Okay, I just needed that...

12:43.048 --> 12:45.079
Are you sure
you can get downstairs alright?

12:45.089 --> 12:47.016
What? Yeah.

12:47.027 --> 12:50.005
Yeah, if I do it really slow.

12:50.015 --> 12:52.902
I know what to do.

15:49.981 --> 15:51.919
The man called.

15:51.929 --> 15:53.980
Said he wants to see you, right away.

15:59.897 --> 16:01.897
Did your son tell you that he saw me?

16:05.866 --> 16:07.866
Hey, he was...
with a friend, you know.

16:07.876 --> 16:09.875
It's just... just a coincidence, man.

16:10.939 --> 16:12.938
Did he tell you where he saw me?

16:13.938 --> 16:15.886
No.

16:15.896 --> 16:18.083
No, I...
I know you wouldn't want me to know, man.

16:19.897 --> 16:21.896
Moises didn't mean to see you, Joe. He...

16:21.907 --> 16:23.854
Don't yell at me.

16:23.865 --> 16:25.865
He's just a stupid freaking kid.

16:26.864 --> 16:28.895
- I know, but...
- He...

16:29.978 --> 16:31.978
We're done, Angel.

16:33.999 --> 16:35.999
Joe, he didn't mean to see you.

16:38.895 --> 16:40.864
Come on.

16:40.874 --> 16:42.852
Take the money.

16:53.009 --> 16:54.935
<i>J...</i>

16:54.945 --> 16:56.915
<i>We're like Jack and Jill</i>

16:56.925 --> 17:00.883
<i>K, you're so kissable</i>

17:01.935 --> 17:03.945
<i>L</i>

17:03.956 --> 17:07.079
<i>Is the love light in your eyes</i>

17:08.974 --> 17:12.994
<i>M, N, O, P</i>

17:13.006 --> 17:16.882
<i>I could go on all day</i>

17:16.892 --> 17:19.028
Yes, you could.

17:19.038 --> 17:22.892
<i>Q, R, S, T</i>

17:22.903 --> 17:24.994
<i>Alphabetically speaking...</i>

17:25.006 --> 17:27.016
<i>You're okay</i>

17:29.078 --> 17:31.079
<i>You make my life complete</i>

17:32.890 --> 17:34.891
<i>V means you're very sweet</i>

17:35.902 --> 17:39.848
<i>W, X, Y, Z</i>

17:44.005 --> 17:46.890
- Mom...
- What?

17:46.901 --> 17:48.900
This fridge is disgusting.

17:48.910 --> 17:51.962
- What's wrong?
- You got...

17:53.920 --> 17:55.921
And all this shit's rotten.

17:56.983 --> 17:58.982
Well, honey,
what are you looking for?

18:01.056 --> 18:03.055
This cream cheese is from 1972.

18:04.899 --> 18:06.930
I use it. Just leave it.

18:15.034 --> 18:17.981
- How's Janice?
- Who's Janice?

18:20.012 --> 18:23.855
Oh, come on.
You know who Janice is.

18:28.022 --> 18:30.877
You mean my girlfriend from 20 years ago?

18:33.835 --> 18:35.834
She would've been a good mom.

18:46.031 --> 18:48.040
<i>Stop it!</i>

18:48.051 --> 18:50.063
Joe?

18:52.854 --> 18:54.000
Coming!

19:46.996 --> 19:48.954
Going up?

20:06.963 --> 20:08.963
What's all this?

20:12.890 --> 20:14.858
That Cincinnati kid.

20:14.869 --> 20:16.869
Parents are florists.

20:19.982 --> 20:24.014
A warm thank you for getting
their darling daughter back home safe.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.972
Flowers.

20:26.982 --> 20:28.929
Josephine loved flowers.

20:29.993 --> 20:32.846
I could never see the point myself.

20:32.856 --> 20:35.856
The fuckers die anyway
and stink up the whole damn place.

20:37.001 --> 20:38.929
God bless her.

20:40.876 --> 20:42.034
Hey, um...

20:42.981 --> 20:45.013
Listen, we gotta lose Angel's number.

20:46.012 --> 20:48.855
- I'll find a new service.
- Okay.

20:49.991 --> 20:52.001
No problem.

20:53.001 --> 20:54.855
So, Angel's out.

20:56.053 --> 21:00.970
You could uh... just call me directly,
you know, like a normal person.

21:09.042 --> 21:11.938
There's no green ones.

21:11.948 --> 21:14.843
- I like green.
- Hm.

21:14.853 --> 21:16.874
Fucking asshole!

21:16.885 --> 21:18.822
Why am I here?

21:19.886 --> 21:21.905
State Senator Albert Votto.

21:23.905 --> 21:26.010
I ran his father's security
back in the '80s.

21:26.988 --> 21:28.998
Lost track of him after his arraignment.

21:29.009 --> 21:31.061
I found a green one.

21:31.820 --> 21:34.987
The wife - Votto Junior's wife -

21:34.997 --> 21:37.884
kills herself a couple of years ago.

21:37.894 --> 21:41.915
Their teenage daughter's
been running away from home ever since.

21:47.975 --> 21:49.966
I'm listening.

21:50.965 --> 21:53.039
Votto calls me this morning.

21:53.049 --> 21:55.059
She's been missing all weekend.

21:55.819 --> 21:57.028
He doesn't wanna get the cops involved

21:57.039 --> 21:59.954
now that he's running
on Governor Williams's ticket.

21:59.965 --> 22:01.954
Ahh!

22:01.965 --> 22:04.943
He's paying 50 grand cash.

22:04.953 --> 22:06.954
What's the lead?

22:06.964 --> 22:09.860
He got an anonymous text with an address.

22:13.839 --> 22:15.964
Meet him at the Union Club, 2pm.

22:18.953 --> 22:22.870
Josephine II is coming out of dry dock,
thanks to this.

22:22.881 --> 22:27.817
I'm gonna drive her through the harbor
with a big fucking fireworks display.

22:29.951 --> 22:35.057
You, me, couple of steaks,
cold beers, setting sun...

22:35.817 --> 22:37.816
What do you say to that?

22:38.848 --> 22:40.035
What?

22:59.721 --> 23:02.606
<i>235 East 31st Street.</i>

23:04.772 --> 23:06.772
<i>That's what the text said.</i>

23:12.762 --> 23:14.762
You have kids, Joe?

23:17.699 --> 23:19.657
No.

23:22.740 --> 23:24.615
Nina.

23:24.626 --> 23:26.593
Her name is Nina.

23:29.583 --> 23:31.583
I've heard of these places...

23:33.605 --> 23:34.791
Underage girls.

23:35.791 --> 23:37.770
Senator, if she's there,

23:37.781 --> 23:39.749
I'll get her.

23:44.644 --> 23:46.644
McCleary said you were brutal.

23:50.665 --> 23:52.665
I can be.

24:09.726 --> 24:11.727
Gonna need this.

24:24.579 --> 24:26.589
Be at this address, 3am.

24:31.662 --> 24:33.693
Hotel Caribe, room 701.

24:40.609 --> 24:42.608
I want you to hurt them.

24:58.732 --> 25:00.733
- Keys.
- Have a nice day.

25:56.582 --> 25:58.582
What are you doing?

26:56.693 --> 26:58.714
Would you mind taking a picture for us?

27:01.735 --> 27:03.547
What?

27:03.557 --> 27:04.754
Would you mind taking
a picture of us?

27:09.547 --> 27:11.546
Thank you so much.

27:34.753 --> 27:37.544
What the fuck are we doing?

27:43.659 --> 27:45.574
Go, go!

28:02.782 --> 28:05.552
He doesn't know...

28:05.563 --> 28:07.562
He has no idea.

28:19.687 --> 28:21.739
I've been waiting for
you for 20 minutes.

28:21.749 --> 28:23.780
Relax, man, relax.
Chill the fuck up.

28:44.549 --> 28:46.549
Don't make me late!

30:40.624 --> 30:42.635
<i>Run! Run!</i>

31:42.609 --> 31:44.661
<i>D) You're delightful and...</i>

31:45.578 --> 31:47.578
<i>E) You're exciting and...</i>

31:49.609 --> 31:52.525
<i>F) You're a feather in my arms</i>

33:33.686 --> 33:37.685
<i>106.79 FM</i>

33:37.695 --> 33:41.674
<i>From Times Square to the South

34:19.744 --> 34:22.608
Go, go!

34:56.533 --> 34:58.542
Hey, excuse me?

34:58.553 --> 35:00.606
Do you know where 239 West is?

35:00.616 --> 35:02.615
Argh!

35:04.584 --> 35:06.512
Argh!

35:07.678 --> 35:09.667
Shh, shh, shh. Relax.

35:09.678 --> 35:11.678
What's your name?

35:12.750 --> 35:14.678
Scott.

35:14.688 --> 35:17.635
I'm Mr. Rogers.
Listen, I'm gonna ask you some questions.

35:17.645 --> 35:19.573
Please be honest with me.

35:19.583 --> 35:23.510
Right, security - how many are there?

35:23.520 --> 35:24.729
Huh? Is there one? More than one?

35:24.739 --> 35:26.708
- Two, three? Come on, talk.
- Two.

35:26.718 --> 35:28.697
Two? Where?

35:28.707 --> 35:30.677
Where in the house are they?

35:31.676 --> 35:33.624
One guy inside the front door.

35:33.634 --> 35:36.509
The second guy on the top floor.

35:36.519 --> 35:37.748
Where's the playground?

35:38.509 --> 35:40.529
Playground?

35:40.539 --> 35:43.634
- The underage girls?
- Third floor.

35:43.644 --> 35:45.654
I just...

35:45.664 --> 35:48.633
I just work here. I just run errands.
I don't...

35:48.643 --> 35:50.590
They're freaks, man.

35:50.601 --> 35:52.550
It's okay.

35:52.560 --> 35:55.571
Do you carry keys? No?

35:55.581 --> 35:57.580
What's the code of the front door?

35:59.633 --> 36:01.632
- 439.
- What is it?

36:01.642 --> 36:03.643
Promise you won't kill me.

36:03.654 --> 36:05.570
What's the fucking code?

36:05.580 --> 36:06.704
4392.

36:06.714 --> 36:08.684
Good boy.

36:09.714 --> 36:11.715
Please.

36:35.702 --> 36:37.693
<i>It's just like heaven</i>

36:37.703 --> 36:40.651
<i>Being here with you</i>

36:40.661 --> 36:43.525
<i>You're like an angel</i>

36:44.556 --> 36:46.598
<i>Too good...</i>

36:46.608 --> 36:48.545

38:24.704 --> 38:26.715
<i>- Get up. Can you hear me?
- My angel baby</i>

38:26.725 --> 38:29.601
My name's Joe.
Come here.

38:29.612 --> 38:31.538
Oh!

38:31.548 --> 38:33.591
Don't move.
Don't move.

38:33.601 --> 38:35.579
It's okay.

38:35.590 --> 38:37.590
It's okay, come here.
Come here.

38:39.505 --> 38:41.516
Turn around. Turn around.

38:41.526 --> 38:43.547
Stay there.

38:43.558 --> 38:47.526

39:13.618 --> 39:17.503
<i>To help him as I see</i>

39:18.596 --> 39:22.575
<i>I felt my world spinning
round and round</i>

39:22.721 --> 39:26.638
<i>Around the wonderful
love I'd found</i>

39:26.648 --> 39:28.700
Close your eyes.

39:31.669 --> 39:35.616
<i>He held me and we kissed</i>

41:25.619 --> 41:27.618
Hey, you want something to drink?

41:32.723 --> 41:35.555
I got you some water
and some sodas.

41:35.565 --> 41:37.504
Thirsty?

41:37.514 --> 41:39.534
Yeah, I wouldn't touch that.
It's gross.

41:41.525 --> 41:43.524
Alright.

41:43.690 --> 41:45.690
It's okay. It's okay.

41:49.649 --> 41:51.648
No, no, no. No.

41:53.575 --> 41:55.575
You don't have to do that.

42:06.699 --> 42:08.699
I'm taking you home to your dad.

42:11.501 --> 42:13.719
And we just have to wait here
a little while longer.

42:17.479 --> 42:19.480
No, no, no.

42:26.603 --> 42:28.603
I have to go.

42:34.478 --> 42:36.479
What's your name?

42:37.613 --> 42:39.613
Joe.

42:41.593 --> 42:43.593
I'm finished now, Joe.

43:29.527 --> 43:31.484
<i>The Pacific Ocean.</i>

43:31.495 --> 43:34.391
<i>Do you know what the Mexicans
say about the Pacific?</i>

43:36.484 --> 43:38.453
<i>They say it has no memory.</i>

43:40.536 --> 43:42.567
<i>That's where I want
to live the rest of my life.</i>

43:45.535 --> 43:49.348
Hey, don't worry,
your dad's gonna be here soon.

43:55.442 --> 43:57.441
Are you alright?

44:03.524 --> 44:05.377
Yes, sir.

44:05.388 --> 44:07.430
<i>Take my guests out

<i>Senator Votto was in the city
campaigning for Governor Williams</i>

44:45.417 --> 44:48.343
<i>in next month's

44:48.500 --> 44:51.385
It's okay. Okay.
Come here. Look at me.

45:03.562 --> 45:08.498
<i>He climbed up on the ledge, stood
there for a second, then stepped off.</i>

45:08.509 --> 45:12.508
<i>Votto had been dogged with
rumors of sexual misconduct...</i>

Joe!

45:31.403 --> 45:33.403
Cute.

45:33.413 --> 45:37.527
Man... you think I don't know
what the fuck's going on here?

45:39.370 --> 45:41.340
I'm just a hired gun.

I don't give a shit about...

45:46.558 --> 45:50.411

Williams.

59:29.352 --> 59:31.424
Governor Williams?

<i>That a woman ain't supposed to see</i>

59:55.328 --> 59:56.505
<i>Do you know what paradise is?</i>

59:56.516 --> 01:00:01.391
<i>It's a lie, a fantasy we create about
people and places as we'd like them to be</i>

01:00:01.401 --> 01:00:04.380
Was my mother afraid?

01:00:04.391 --> 01:00:07.474
<i>It's that little baby you're holding
and it's the man you fought with</i>

<i>For unborn children</i>

01:00:19.442 --> 01:00:22.328
<i>That might have
made me complete</i>

01:00:22.339 --> 01:00:24.515
<i>But I took the sweet life</i>

01:00:25.275 --> 01:00:28.378
<i>And never knew I'd be bitter</i>

01:00:28.389 --> 01:00:30.305

<i>If I knew you were coming,
I'd have baked a cake</i>

01:18:32.267 --> 01:18:34.476
<i>Hired a band, goodness' sake</i>

01:18:35.236 --> 01:18:37.308
<i>If I knew you were coming,
I'd have baked a cake</i>

01:18:37.318 --> 01:18:39.412
<i>How do you do,
how do you do, how do you do?</i>

01:18:39.423 --> 01:18:41.442
Where are we going?

01:18:47.350 --> 01:18:48.433
Well...

01:18:52.349 --> 01:18:54.276
We can go wherever you want.

01:18:58.296 --> 01:19:00.297
Where do you want to go?

01:19:04.327 --> 01:19:06.316
I, I don't know.

01:19:10.327 --> 01:19:11.472
I don't know either.

01:19:12.233 --> 01:19:14.315
<i>Baked a cake, baked a cake</i>

01:19:14.326 --> 01:19:16.473
<i>If I knew you were coming,
I'd have baked a cake</i>

01:19:17.232 --> 01:19:19.315
<i>How do you do,
how do you do, how do you do?</i>

01:19:19.326 --> 01:19:22.377
<i>Had you dropped me a letter,
I'd have hired a band</i>

01:19:22.387 --> 01:19:25.253
<i>Grandest band in the land</i>

01:19:25.263 --> 01:19:28.262
<i>Had you dropped me a letter,
I'd have hired a band</i>

01:19:28.273 --> 01:19:30.367
<i>And spread the welcome
mat for you</i>

01:19:30.377 --> 01:19:33.325
<i>Oh, I don't know where
you came from</i>

01:19:33.335 --> 01:19:36.313
<i>Cos I don't know
where you've been</i>

01:19:36.324 --> 01:19:39.272
<i>But it really doesn't matter,
grab your chair and fill a platter</i>

01:19:39.282 --> 01:19:41.324
<i>And dig, dig, dig right in</i>

01:19:41.334 --> 01:19:44.418
<i>If I knew you were coming,
I'd have baked a cake</i>

01:19:44.428 --> 01:19:47.407
<i>Hired a band, goodness' sake...</i>

01:20:24.249 --> 01:20:25.404
Well, you look great.

01:20:25.415 --> 01:20:28.227
Excuse me, could I get
a little bit of butter?

01:20:28.237 --> 01:20:30.300
You know you're not supposed
to have butter.

01:20:30.310 --> 01:20:32.383
How do you know
I'm not supposed to have it?

01:20:32.394 --> 01:20:35.269
We all know you're
not supposed to have it.

01:20:38.434 --> 01:20:40.435
Have a nice day.

01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:55.234
Hey.

01:20:55.245 --> 01:20:57.256
Joe? Wake up.

01:21:17.432 --> 01:21:19.380
What?

01:21:19.391 --> 01:21:21.307
Let's go.

01:21:22.327 --> 01:21:24.275
It's a beautiful day.

01:21:31.462 --> 01:21:33.409
It is a beautiful day.

01:21:37.264 --> 01:21:39.462
<i>If I knew you were coming,
I'd have baked a cake</i>

01:21:40.222 --> 01:21:42.441
<i>Baked a cake, baked a cake</i>

01:21:42.451 --> 01:21:45.315
<i>If I knew you were coming,
I'd have baked a cake</i>

01:21:45.325 --> 01:21:48.221
<i>How do you do,
how do you do, how do you do?</i>
