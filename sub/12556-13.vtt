THANK YOU,
WILLIAM.

01:06.358 --> 01:08.315
CUT.

01:08.402 --> 01:11.440
(Corrigan) WHAT'S YOUR POINT?
THAT, IF IT WERE POSSIBLE

01:11.530 --> 01:13.112
FORA PERSON
TO GO BACK IN TIME,

01:13.198 --> 01:14.984
THERE'D BE NOTHING
TO PREVENT THEM

01:15.075 --> 01:17.533
FROM ALTERING THE COURSE OF HISTORY?
IS THAT IT?

01:17.619 --> 01:20.111
THAT'S RIGHT.
LET'S SAY, CORRIGAN,

01:20.205 --> 01:22.492
THAT YOU GO BACK IN TIME.
IT'S OCTOBER, 1929,

01:22.583 --> 01:24.699
THE DAY BEFORE THE
STOCK MARKET CRASHED.

01:24.793 --> 01:26.875
YOU KNOW THAT,
ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING,

01:26.962 --> 01:29.374
SECURITIES ARE GOING TO
TUMBLE INTO AN ABYSS.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.421
NOW, USING THIS
PRIOR KNOWLEDGE,

01:31.508 --> 01:34.626
THERE'S A HUNDRED THINGS YOU
COULD DO TO PROTECT YOURSELF.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.302
BUT I'D BE
AN ANACHRONISM.

01:36.388 --> 01:38.095
I REALLY DON'T
BELONG BACK THERE.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.388
YOU COULD SELL OUT THE
DAY BEFORE THE CRASH.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.967
BUT VVHAT IF I DID, AND
STARTED THE CRASH EARLIER?

01:43.061 --> 01:46.474
NOVV, HISTORY TELLS US
THAT ON OCTOBER 24, 1929,

01:46.565 --> 01:49.603
THE BOTTOM FELL OUT OF THE STOCK MARKET.
THAT'S A FIXED DATE,

01:49.693 --> 01:52.151
<i>IT EXISTS AS AN EVENT IN
THE HISTORY OF OUR TIMES.</i>

01:52.237 --> 01:53.568
<i>IT CAN'T BE ALTERED.</i>

01:53.655 --> 01:54.816
I SAY IT CAN.

01:54.906 --> 01:56.067
WHAT'S TO
PREVENT ME,

01:56.158 --> 01:57.648
FROM GOING
TO A BROKER

01:57.743 --> 02:01.077
ON THE MORNING OF

LIKE GOING BACK IN TIME.

02:11.006 --> 02:14.249
A FRIENDLY DEBATE REVOLVING
AROUND A SIMPLE ISSUE,

02:14.343 --> 02:17.426
COULD A HUMAN BEING CHANGE
WHAT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE?

02:17.512 --> 02:19.344
INTERESTING AND THEORETICAL

02:19.389 --> 02:22.006

02:41.828 --> 02:44.160
AND, SINCE NO ONE HAS
EVER GONE BACK INTO TIME,

02:44.247 --> 02:48.457
I FIND THE VVHOLE BLAME SUBJECT
MUCH TOO THEORETICAL ANYVVAY.

02:48.543 --> 02:50.830
PHIL, I'LL PROBABLY SEE
YOU OVER THE VVEEKEND.

02:50.921 --> 02:53.037

11:19.345 --> 11:21.427
ON THE WORD
OF SOME DEMENTED FOOL

11:21.514 --> 11:24.006
WHO PROBABLY LEFT
HIS MIND IN GETTYSBURG?

11:24.100 --> 11:27.138
<i>IF I WERE YOU, MISTER, I'D BE
CONSIDERABLY MORE THOUGHTFUL</i>

HURT IF-

11:35.904 --> 11:37.235
IT WOULDN'T
HURT IF WHAT?

11:37.322 --> 11:38.983
I ONLY MEANT
TO SUGGEST, SIR,

11:39.073 --> 11:41.064
THAT IF PERHAPS VVE
PLACED AN EXTRA GUARD

11:41.159 --> 11:42.741

11:42.785 --> 11:44.526

HAS ENOUGH GUARDS!

11:44.621 --> 11:46.737
THE WHOLE FEDERAL ARMY
