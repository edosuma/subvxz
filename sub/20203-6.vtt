WEBVTT

00:05.999 --> 00:10.404
**

00:10.404 --> 00:12.806
The year was 1963.

00:12.806 --> 00:15.576
The first James Bond
film Dr. No

00:15.576 --> 00:17.778
was a hit in the theaters...

00:17.778 --> 00:20.280
* Here's a little song you
can all join in with *

00:20.280 --> 00:22.583
* It's very simple
and I hope it's new, yeah *

00:22.583 --> 00:27.788
Coca-Cola introduced a new
calorie-free soda called Tab

00:27.788 --> 00:31.024
and a little-known band from
Liverpool named the Beatles

00:31.024 --> 00:34.862
had shot up to the top
of the charts in the UK.

00:34.862 --> 00:39.633
**

00:39.633 --> 00:42.436
But on November 22nd
of that year,

00:42.436 --> 00:46.974
the assassination of John F.
Kennedy changed everything.

00:46.974 --> 00:50.811
**

00:50.811 --> 00:53.447
While the country
was still in shock,

00:53.447 --> 00:56.049
I was in the midst
of a trial,

00:56.049 --> 00:58.852
facing jail time
on obscenity charges

00:58.852 --> 01:01.722
for publishing nude pictures
of actress Jayne Mansfield

01:01.722 --> 01:06.293
in the pages
of Playboy magazine.

01:06.293 --> 01:09.363
**

01:13.467 --> 01:16.804
After weeks of arguments,

01:16.804 --> 01:21.742
it was finally time
to hear the verdict.

01:21.742 --> 01:24.111
Bailiff...

01:32.285 --> 01:35.656
I know what pornography is
and I know what obscenity is,

01:35.656 --> 01:37.791
and it certainly isn't
Playboy and never has been.

01:37.791 --> 01:43.130
But again, we were questioning
the traditional values,

01:43.130 --> 01:45.365
and that context, I think,

01:45.365 --> 01:47.034
is what got us
into the most trouble.

01:53.240 --> 01:56.109
Defendant, please rise.

02:01.214 --> 02:02.683
On the counts of publishing

02:02.683 --> 02:05.553
and distributing
an obscene publication,

02:05.553 --> 02:10.724
the jury has been unable
to reach a verdict.

02:10.724 --> 02:13.260
Mr. Hefner,
you are free to go.

02:13.260 --> 02:16.797
**

02:16.797 --> 02:18.065
* All right *

02:18.065 --> 02:20.701
**

02:20.701 --> 02:23.937
* I been a-hopin'
and a-prayin' *

02:23.937 --> 02:25.906
* For such a long time *

02:25.906 --> 02:28.609
The jury was deadlocked
7 to 5

02:28.609 --> 02:30.010
in favor of acquittal...

02:30.010 --> 02:31.779
**

02:31.779 --> 02:34.347
...and all charges
against me were dropped.

02:34.347 --> 02:36.149
* Ain't it a good thing? *

02:36.149 --> 02:37.651
**

02:37.651 --> 02:39.487
* Ain't it a good thing? *

02:39.487 --> 02:40.621
**

02:40.621 --> 02:42.355
I felt relieved

02:42.355 --> 02:46.093
and like I'd won a major
victory for free speech.

02:46.093 --> 02:47.194
**

02:47.194 --> 02:50.030
* Oh, ain't it
a good thing? *

02:50.030 --> 02:51.231
**

02:51.231 --> 02:53.033
My fight was finally over,

02:53.033 --> 02:55.569
but world events
were about to reshape

02:55.569 --> 02:58.238
the country and Playboy.

02:58.238 --> 03:01.709
**

03:01.709 --> 03:05.345
* Every little movement *

03:05.345 --> 03:09.850
* Every little thing
you do *

03:09.850 --> 03:12.285
* Is it sleight of hand *

03:12.285 --> 03:17.457
* That commands my heart
to love you? *

03:17.457 --> 03:21.261
* Every little movement *

03:21.261 --> 03:25.232
* Every
little movement **

03:25.232 --> 03:27.835
**

03:39.412 --> 03:42.215
With the obscenity case
behind us,

03:42.215 --> 03:44.284
Playboy spent
the next two years

03:44.284 --> 03:47.120
getting back to business,
publishing centerfolds

03:47.120 --> 03:50.824
next to articles
promoting social justice.

03:50.824 --> 03:55.095
But by 1965,
there was one issue

03:55.095 --> 03:58.599
that overshadowed
all the others.

04:00.734 --> 04:02.636
This is the hot spot
in the Cold War

04:02.636 --> 04:04.572
and this year saw it
getting hotter.

04:04.572 --> 04:07.074
* The Eastern world *

04:07.074 --> 04:08.642
* It is exploding *

04:08.642 --> 04:10.110
* Violence flaring *

04:10.110 --> 04:11.411
America had been locked

04:11.411 --> 04:13.346
in conflict in Vietnam

04:13.346 --> 04:15.182
since the mid '50s,

04:15.182 --> 04:17.017
but every year,
our involvement

04:17.017 --> 04:19.086
in the war kept increasing.

04:19.086 --> 04:24.391
In 1963, there were
16,000 troops in Vietnam.

04:24.391 --> 04:28.495
By '65, there were 125,000.

04:28.495 --> 04:30.898
* Oh you don't believe *

04:30.898 --> 04:34.334
* We're on the eve
of destruction *

04:34.334 --> 04:37.370
Vietnam starts off
with, uh, oh,

04:37.370 --> 04:38.672
we're just gonna
be contained,

04:38.672 --> 04:40.608
and military advisors here

04:40.608 --> 04:42.009
that'll support
the government

04:42.009 --> 04:43.811
at this resistance
to tyranny,

04:43.811 --> 04:46.013
and then it escalated
and escalated,

04:46.013 --> 04:48.281
and more and more,
uh, kids are being sent

04:48.281 --> 04:51.484
over to Vietnam, and more
and more kids are dying.

04:51.484 --> 04:52.586
* Can't you feel
the fears *

04:52.586 --> 04:54.454
* I'm feeling today? *

04:54.454 --> 04:56.624
With more casualties
every day,

04:56.624 --> 04:59.893
demonstrators took
to the streets

04:59.893 --> 05:02.329
and young men began
burning their draft cards.

05:02.329 --> 05:04.564
* Take a look
around you, boy *

05:04.564 --> 05:07.601
* It's bound to scare you,
boy, and you tell me *

05:07.601 --> 05:09.569
Never before
had an American war

05:09.569 --> 05:11.905
been protested so openly,

05:11.905 --> 05:14.642
and I knew the voices
of these young radicals

05:14.642 --> 05:16.576
belonged in Playboy.

05:16.576 --> 05:21.615
* We're on the eve
of destruction **

05:26.153 --> 05:29.356
So I hired a new
assistant editor...

05:29.356 --> 05:34.594
**

05:34.594 --> 05:37.530
* We'll call you when
you're six years old *

05:37.530 --> 05:39.232
...a popular
young journalist

05:39.232 --> 05:41.401
who had written
politically-charged pieces

05:41.401 --> 05:44.638
for The Village Voice
named Arthur Kretchmer.

05:44.638 --> 05:47.775
* To train your brain
for 18 years *

05:47.775 --> 05:51.344
I was hired with a bunch
of other hip, connected,

05:51.344 --> 05:53.313
intelligent young people.

05:53.313 --> 05:55.515
Some of us were smoking dope.

05:55.515 --> 06:00.788
Some of us were emphatically
against the Vietnam War.

06:00.788 --> 06:01.822
I think all of our editors

06:01.822 --> 06:03.691
were a little bit
to the left,

06:03.691 --> 06:06.760
but Arthur represented
his generation

06:06.760 --> 06:09.529
and he was well connected
with that world.

06:09.529 --> 06:15.969
**

06:15.969 --> 06:18.371
Next we have a piece

06:18.371 --> 06:20.107
for our attire section.

06:20.107 --> 06:22.275
No man, no matter
how fashion-conscious,

06:22.275 --> 06:25.045
enjoys having to spend
days or even weeks

06:25.045 --> 06:27.480
breaking in
a new pair of shoes.

06:27.480 --> 06:31.118
Jesus Christ.

06:31.118 --> 06:33.821
I'm sorry, did you have
something to contribute?

06:33.821 --> 06:36.389
Yeah. Who cares?

06:36.389 --> 06:38.391
Seriously, who gives a shit?

06:38.391 --> 06:40.227
There's a war
going on out there,

06:40.227 --> 06:41.561
and we're sitting
around here bickering

06:41.561 --> 06:42.830
about how many days
it takes

06:42.830 --> 06:45.065
to break in a pair
of goddamn shoes.

06:45.065 --> 06:48.101
Last month,
100,000 Americans

06:48.101 --> 06:50.237
demonstrated in cities
across the country.

06:50.237 --> 06:53.006
Last week, a man stood
in front of the Pentagon,

06:53.006 --> 06:56.409
doused himself in kerosene,
and set himself on fire.

06:56.409 --> 06:58.278
And what the hell
are we doing about it?

06:58.278 --> 07:01.381
What the hell is
Playboy saying about it?

07:01.381 --> 07:03.851
Nothing.

07:05.218 --> 07:06.887
In case you haven't
noticed,

07:06.887 --> 07:09.322
you're no longer working
at The Village Voice.

07:09.322 --> 07:11.992
Let them cover those
types of stories.

07:11.992 --> 07:14.427
No, I think we should have
something to say about it.

07:14.427 --> 07:18.365
If it matters to us,
it matters to our readers.

07:18.365 --> 07:23.370
Bring in an article.
If it's good, I'll run it.

07:23.370 --> 07:24.772
Shall I continue?

07:24.772 --> 07:26.306
Mm-hmm.

07:28.008 --> 07:31.945
For our humor section,

07:31.945 --> 07:34.848
a fresh slate
of party jokes.

07:37.350 --> 07:42.355
Spectorsky and I
developed conflict,

07:42.355 --> 07:45.258
and Spectorsky hated
the word "political"

07:45.258 --> 07:46.626
and hated politics.

07:46.626 --> 07:48.896
I really did represent
something

07:48.896 --> 07:50.663
that he wasn't ready for.

07:50.663 --> 07:54.434
**

07:54.434 --> 07:56.937
* There is a man *

07:56.937 --> 07:59.039
* A tall man *

07:59.039 --> 08:00.407
* Follows no... *

08:00.407 --> 08:02.175
Soon Kretchmer pushed us

08:02.175 --> 08:04.211
to take a stance
on the Vietnam War.

08:04.211 --> 08:05.879
* Out in a storm *

08:05.879 --> 08:07.347
* Can he stay warm *

08:07.347 --> 08:10.217
But he didn't stop there.

08:10.217 --> 08:13.153
Britain recently abolished
the death penalty.

08:13.153 --> 08:14.988
If we're supposed to be the
freest country in the world,

08:14.988 --> 08:16.756
why are we one of
the few western nations

08:16.756 --> 08:19.559
that hasn't banned
capital punishment?

08:19.559 --> 08:20.961
* Can't he move on? *

08:20.961 --> 08:22.963
* Tell him it's all right *

08:22.963 --> 08:26.066
We called for the abolition
of the death penalty,

08:26.066 --> 08:28.936
arguing not only
that it was barbaric

08:28.936 --> 08:31.138
but that it was
disproportionately used

08:31.138 --> 08:32.873
against poor people.

08:32.873 --> 08:35.475
* There is a man *

08:35.475 --> 08:37.077
We published pieces

08:37.077 --> 08:39.446
promoting access
to contraception

08:39.446 --> 08:42.349
and safe and inexpensive
abortions for women.

08:42.349 --> 08:45.018
* Can his new wife *

08:45.018 --> 08:46.887
* Live out her life *

08:46.887 --> 08:48.288
Playboy has always had

08:48.288 --> 08:51.024
a strong editorial
point of view,

08:51.024 --> 08:52.826
and it's reflected
in everything we do.

08:52.826 --> 08:55.495
While the magazine
was a magazine

08:55.495 --> 08:57.397
of entertainment for men,

08:57.397 --> 08:59.632
the real intention
and message ran much deeper.

08:59.632 --> 09:01.634
* It's all right *

09:01.634 --> 09:03.736
* Say it's all right **

09:03.736 --> 09:07.941
**

09:09.409 --> 09:10.878
Fighting for change

09:10.878 --> 09:13.546
energized
the entire office,

09:13.546 --> 09:16.984
and soon, letters began
pouring in from readers,

09:16.984 --> 09:18.451
letting us know
that they also

09:18.451 --> 09:20.287
wanted to be part
of the debate.

09:20.287 --> 09:21.521
* Staring at
the boob tube *

09:21.521 --> 09:23.290
* Turning on
the big knob *

09:23.290 --> 09:25.292
* Trying to find
some life in the... *

09:25.292 --> 09:28.461
So I created The Playboy
Forum to open a dialogue.

09:28.461 --> 09:30.297
* Gonna deal
with Mary Jane *

09:30.297 --> 09:32.365
The forum became
an interchange of ideas

09:32.365 --> 09:34.501
between myself
and readers...

09:34.501 --> 09:36.169
* Obnoxious Joe
comes on the screen *

09:36.169 --> 09:39.072
...covering sex, marriage,

09:39.072 --> 09:42.375
religion,
police, economics...

09:42.375 --> 09:45.378
anything relevant
to social change.

09:45.378 --> 09:47.847
By having a conversation

09:47.847 --> 09:50.050
with millions
of men and women

09:50.050 --> 09:51.418
through The Playboy Forum,

09:51.418 --> 09:53.921
I think clearly
was a major contributor

09:53.921 --> 09:59.259
to people feeling comfortable
and not feeling so alone.

09:59.259 --> 10:00.693
Of course, a lot of people

10:00.693 --> 10:03.330
only wanted to talk
about Vietnam.

10:03.330 --> 10:05.032
**

10:05.032 --> 10:08.835
Many of our loyal readers
were now serving overseas,

10:08.835 --> 10:10.270
eager to voice
their opinions

10:10.270 --> 10:12.005
and share
their experiences

10:12.005 --> 10:13.673
from the front lines.

10:13.673 --> 10:15.842
**

10:15.842 --> 10:18.545
* Well it's evil, wicked *

10:18.545 --> 10:22.749
When Time magazine was still
promoting the war in Vietnam,

10:22.749 --> 10:27.087
The Playboy Forum gave
real soldiers a chance to say

10:27.087 --> 10:29.289
what their reality was
in Vietnam,

10:29.289 --> 10:32.725
and it was this place
to put actual testimony

10:32.725 --> 10:34.928
about what was going on.

10:37.264 --> 10:38.831
Abortion is still illegal.

10:38.831 --> 10:40.233
The Chicago Women's
Liberation Union

10:40.233 --> 10:42.002
are speaking out about it
and so should we.

10:42.002 --> 10:44.071
But then I took it
one step further,

10:44.071 --> 10:47.840
beyond the pages
of the magazine,

10:47.840 --> 10:50.843
and created
The Playboy Foundation...

10:50.843 --> 10:53.046
**

10:53.046 --> 10:56.316
...an organization dedicated
to fighting censorship

10:56.316 --> 10:59.386
and funding
civil rights groups.

11:01.321 --> 11:03.323
Hef had said that
The Playboy Foundation

11:03.323 --> 11:06.059
was intended to put his
money where his mouth was

11:06.059 --> 11:09.596
for issues that were not
just relevant to Playboy

11:09.596 --> 11:13.000
but were relevant to
a broader philosophy

11:13.000 --> 11:15.602
of what makes
for a just society.

11:15.602 --> 11:19.439
We donated hundreds
of thousands of dollars

11:19.439 --> 11:21.908
to the Kinsey Institute,

11:21.908 --> 11:25.645
an organization whose
research on sex and sexuality

11:25.645 --> 11:28.448
had inspired the founding
of the magazine.

11:28.448 --> 11:31.985
We involved ourselves in
landmark civil rights cases

11:31.985 --> 11:37.457
such as Roe v. Wade
and continued to support

11:37.457 --> 11:40.027
the African-American
struggle for freedom.

11:40.027 --> 11:43.096
**

11:46.099 --> 11:49.169
* When I left before *

11:49.169 --> 11:52.172
Across the country,
the civil rights movement

11:52.172 --> 11:56.743
was making
significant progress,

11:56.743 --> 12:00.780
and just a year earlier,
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

12:00.780 --> 12:05.818
was awarded the Nobel Peace
prize for his work.

12:05.818 --> 12:07.354
It was an incredible moment

12:07.354 --> 12:08.888
for the
civil rights movement,

12:08.888 --> 12:12.025
one we wanted to celebrate.

12:12.025 --> 12:14.861
So, in January of 1965,

12:14.861 --> 12:17.664
we published an interview
with Dr. King,

12:17.664 --> 12:20.233
the longest one
he ever granted.

12:20.233 --> 12:23.036
* But I keep coming back *

12:23.036 --> 12:24.971
When Playboy interviewed
Dr. King,

12:24.971 --> 12:26.239
it was a serious breakthrough

12:26.239 --> 12:28.775
because it was a chance
for another market.

12:28.775 --> 12:32.345
I mean, those days you
didn't have cable television.

12:32.345 --> 12:34.714
We didn't have much access.

12:34.714 --> 12:36.683
**

12:36.683 --> 12:40.320
MLK Jr.'s voice was
perfectly suited for Playboy.

12:40.320 --> 12:43.156
If you take a step back and
look at all the other pieces

12:43.156 --> 12:45.325
of what makes Playboy
Playboy,

12:45.325 --> 12:48.461
I can't think of another
magazine or media company

12:48.461 --> 12:51.598
where the conversation would
have been more appropriate.

12:51.598 --> 12:53.566
In his interview
with Playboy,

12:53.566 --> 12:56.336
King emphasized
how far we'd come,

12:56.336 --> 12:59.739
but he also explained
how far we had to go.

12:59.739 --> 13:01.441
**

13:01.441 --> 13:03.276
With a nonviolent movement,

13:03.276 --> 13:06.012
the end is to
convert the opponent

13:06.012 --> 13:07.914
and to bring about a society

13:07.914 --> 13:10.350
where all men will live
together as brothers

13:10.350 --> 13:12.519
and every man will
respect the dignity

13:12.519 --> 13:14.821
and worth
of human personality.

13:14.821 --> 13:16.889
**

13:16.889 --> 13:19.726
So, just months after being
featured in the magazine,

13:19.726 --> 13:25.365
King led a march
of 25,000 Americans,

13:25.365 --> 13:28.135
black and white,

13:28.135 --> 13:30.337
on a 54-mile journey

13:30.337 --> 13:32.872
from Selma, Alabama,

13:32.872 --> 13:34.507
to the state's capital,

13:34.507 --> 13:37.744
to show their support for
a new voting rights bill

13:37.744 --> 13:41.114
in the face
of ruthless opposition.

13:59.432 --> 14:00.700
After being attacked

14:00.700 --> 14:03.736
with nightsticks
and teargas,

14:03.736 --> 14:08.975
Dr. King and protesters
arrived in Montgomery.

14:08.975 --> 14:12.345
We are standing before
the forces of power

14:12.345 --> 14:14.013
in the State of Alabama,

14:14.013 --> 14:17.217
saying we ain't gonna
let nobody turn us around.

14:23.022 --> 14:28.661
What we saw in the news
shocked the entire nation.

14:28.661 --> 14:30.129
**

14:30.129 --> 14:33.400
There's no question that
the power of the media

14:33.400 --> 14:35.635
was a major force

14:35.635 --> 14:39.038
because it allowed
the civil rights protestors

14:39.038 --> 14:41.374
to get their message out

14:41.374 --> 14:43.910
by generating
images of oppression

14:43.910 --> 14:47.847
that were compelling
because they were so violent.

14:47.847 --> 14:49.382
**

14:49.382 --> 14:52.018
After considerable
public pressure,

14:52.018 --> 14:53.453
President Johnson passed

14:53.453 --> 14:57.490
the Voting Rights Act
of 1965, which outlawed

14:57.490 --> 15:00.727
discriminatory voting
practices based on race.

15:00.727 --> 15:02.429
**

15:02.429 --> 15:06.266
This bill will
strike down restrictions

15:06.266 --> 15:09.702
to voting in all elections.

15:14.507 --> 15:19.178
America was beginning
to see we needed change.

15:19.178 --> 15:23.650
**

15:29.055 --> 15:32.692
With progress being made
throughout the country,

15:32.692 --> 15:34.827
I wanted to break
the color barrier

15:34.827 --> 15:38.931
in all aspects
of our magazine.

15:38.931 --> 15:40.066
**

15:40.066 --> 15:41.100
Hi.

15:41.100 --> 15:42.335
Hi.

15:42.335 --> 15:44.070
If you could just
slip this on.

15:44.070 --> 15:48.975
* And when you come
to see me baby *

15:48.975 --> 15:51.811
* You don't have to
bring no note *

15:51.811 --> 15:54.947
* You gotta have sweet
sweet lovin' *

15:54.947 --> 15:57.149
In March of 1965,

15:57.149 --> 15:58.718
we published
the first ever

15:58.718 --> 16:01.153
African-American
Playmate of the month,

16:01.153 --> 16:03.089
Jennifer Jackson.

16:03.089 --> 16:04.991
* I said baby *

16:04.991 --> 16:06.793
We found Jenny
working part-time

16:06.793 --> 16:08.895
in our Chicago
Playboy Club.

16:08.895 --> 16:11.964
She was a Bunny alongside
her twin sister, Jan,

16:11.964 --> 16:15.768
while studying at
a Chicago Teachers' College

16:15.768 --> 16:19.238
and doing some freelance
modeling on the side.

16:19.238 --> 16:21.808
**

16:21.808 --> 16:26.679
When Playboy published its
first African-American Playmate,

16:26.679 --> 16:30.049
it was a really
important comment

16:30.049 --> 16:32.619
on race relations
at the time.

16:32.619 --> 16:36.689
This was an important
acknowledgment of black women

16:36.689 --> 16:39.426
and their sexuality
and their beauty.

16:39.426 --> 16:40.693
* Sweet lovin' *

16:40.693 --> 16:42.595
* And that's all you need *

16:42.595 --> 16:44.731
* Oh yeah **

16:45.965 --> 16:47.834
**

16:47.834 --> 16:50.337
Reader responses
to Jennifer's centerfold

16:50.337 --> 16:52.772
were mostly positive,

16:52.772 --> 16:55.241
but we still got
some backlash,

16:55.241 --> 16:56.776
which convinced me

16:56.776 --> 16:59.879
there was still a lot
of work to be done.

16:59.879 --> 17:03.583
**

17:03.583 --> 17:04.884
I need it by 2 p.m.
Thank you.

17:04.884 --> 17:06.853
Uh, Spec.

17:06.853 --> 17:09.856
As Playboy became
more political,

17:09.856 --> 17:12.559
I continued
to personally oversee

17:12.559 --> 17:14.761
every page
of the magazine

17:14.761 --> 17:17.697
to make sure it was
as good as it could be.

17:17.697 --> 17:21.100
I am by nature
a perfectionist, anyway.

17:21.100 --> 17:24.471
I think the difference
between good and excellent

17:24.471 --> 17:27.273
is detail,
and I was consumed

17:27.273 --> 17:31.243
with every kind of detail
related to the company.

17:31.243 --> 17:34.481
**

17:38.785 --> 17:43.723
Soon, there didn't seem to
be enough hours in the day,

17:43.723 --> 17:50.262
so I relied on a little
orange pill, Dexedrine.

17:50.262 --> 17:52.665
**

17:52.665 --> 17:54.501
Dexedrine is an upper.

17:54.501 --> 17:56.002
It keeps you awake.

17:56.002 --> 17:59.606
It was originally
formulated as a drug

17:59.606 --> 18:01.073
to help you lose weight,

18:01.073 --> 18:06.312
but it has this other
quality that gives you pep

18:06.312 --> 18:07.814
and keeps you going.

18:07.814 --> 18:10.683
**

18:15.488 --> 18:19.291
* One, two, three, four... *

18:19.291 --> 18:22.662
**

18:22.662 --> 18:25.665
* Fortune has me
well in hand *

18:25.665 --> 18:27.767
I never tried hard drugs.

18:27.767 --> 18:31.070
I didn't believe in them.

18:31.070 --> 18:35.074
But Dexedrine
was completely legal

18:35.074 --> 18:39.479
and my doctor kept
prescribing it,

18:39.479 --> 18:42.615
so I told myself it
was a harmless little pill.

18:42.615 --> 18:45.585
* And brought you
to my bed *

18:45.585 --> 18:48.421
But pretty soon,
I couldn't live without it.

18:48.421 --> 18:50.457
* Everybody loves me baby *

18:50.457 --> 18:53.192
Page 37,
the robe is not...

18:53.192 --> 18:55.962
The colors here
are confusing.

18:55.962 --> 18:56.896
Page 29...

18:56.896 --> 18:57.964
Dexedrine helped Hefner

18:57.964 --> 19:00.700
write very long,
very dense memos

19:00.700 --> 19:02.969
and engage in
very long meetings.

19:02.969 --> 19:06.839
We used to go to meetings
at 4:00 in the afternoon.

19:06.839 --> 19:10.543
They would last until 6:00
the next morning.

19:10.543 --> 19:13.012
* To offend you *

19:13.012 --> 19:14.447
* Now *

19:14.447 --> 19:16.315
I would take them
as I needed them,

19:16.315 --> 19:20.720
but the work could often go
for 24 or 30 or more hours,

19:20.720 --> 19:22.555
so it was possible
in that timeframe

19:22.555 --> 19:25.592
to use 20, 25 pills.

19:25.592 --> 19:26.893
I don't think
I would have created

19:26.893 --> 19:29.762
the Playboy empire
without it.

19:29.762 --> 19:33.700
* Because everybody
loves me baby *

19:33.700 --> 19:36.202
He became very dependent
on Dexedrine.

19:36.202 --> 19:37.937
Scrap it.

19:37.937 --> 19:40.907
If he was taking the drug,

19:40.907 --> 19:44.110
that let him work for
two days or even more...

19:44.110 --> 19:46.378
* Everybody loves me baby *

19:46.378 --> 19:49.916
And then, he was so
exhausted that he'd crash.

19:49.916 --> 19:54.754
When he would awaken,
he would be a bit of a grouch.

19:54.754 --> 19:57.256
* What did I do
to offend you? *

19:57.256 --> 19:59.526
Yeah!

20:04.564 --> 20:05.732
Hef.

20:05.732 --> 20:06.866
I'll be done
with the new notes

20:06.866 --> 20:08.234
on the mansion piece
in ten minutes.

20:08.234 --> 20:10.102
Then I'm gonna go over
the Zwerin article.

20:10.102 --> 20:11.470
Tell everyone else to go over
what they're working on, too.

20:11.470 --> 20:12.539
I'm seeing
too many errors.

20:12.539 --> 20:13.740
I've already sent them home.

20:13.740 --> 20:16.075
What? You sent them home?

20:16.075 --> 20:17.644
They need to be
with their families.

20:17.644 --> 20:18.645
But they're working, Spec.

20:18.645 --> 20:19.846
It's after midnight.

20:19.846 --> 20:21.914
What, so people
can't work late now?

20:21.914 --> 20:23.049
Three nights in a row?
No, Hef, they can't.

20:23.049 --> 20:24.250
They can't keep
their eyes open.

20:24.250 --> 20:25.384
That's fine.

20:25.384 --> 20:26.385
Just means more work
for you and me.

20:26.385 --> 20:28.755
You cannot keep doing this.

20:28.755 --> 20:30.823
Oh, is it my fault
if the articles are shit?

20:30.823 --> 20:33.593
The articles are fine.
The problem is you.

20:33.593 --> 20:35.261
You've been up
for three days.

20:35.261 --> 20:37.329
You're a wreck.

20:37.329 --> 20:40.633
You are
killing yourself.

20:40.633 --> 20:41.634
I'm fine.

20:41.634 --> 20:43.035
You're not fine.

20:43.035 --> 20:44.637
If you want to leave,
then leave.

20:44.637 --> 20:46.706
Maybe I'm the only one
around here

20:46.706 --> 20:47.974
who still remembers
what it takes

20:47.974 --> 20:49.375
to put out a good magazine,

20:49.375 --> 20:51.778
but I am not going to
be lectured by you.

20:51.778 --> 20:53.212
Do you even hear yourself?

20:53.212 --> 20:55.514
Get out!

21:19.639 --> 21:21.407
When Hef became addicted,

21:21.407 --> 21:25.277
Hefner was accurately
described as self-centered,

21:25.277 --> 21:27.580
demanding, obsessive.

21:27.580 --> 21:30.683
Monstrous, even,
you could say.

21:30.683 --> 21:32.284
Really difficult
to deal with.

21:50.670 --> 21:55.174
My staff had reached
a breaking point,

21:55.174 --> 21:59.679
and it was clear that I
needed to make some changes.

22:10.690 --> 22:13.760
When I stopped
taking the Dexedrine,

22:13.760 --> 22:18.831
it took
the better part of a year

22:18.831 --> 22:22.669
for my own body to kick in
and give me back

22:22.669 --> 22:25.204
what I'd previously gotten
from the drug.

22:25.204 --> 22:29.108
If you start using an
artificial stimulus for it,

22:29.108 --> 22:31.944
then the body starts
depending on that,

22:31.944 --> 22:35.547
and it needs more of it,
and, you know,

22:35.547 --> 22:37.884
they do all those jokes
about get high on life,

22:37.884 --> 22:39.618
but it's true.

22:39.618 --> 22:43.389
**

22:43.389 --> 22:45.491
While I was
regaining my health,

22:45.491 --> 22:47.760
Playboy was getting
bigger every month

22:47.760 --> 22:49.528
and the effects
of our hard work

22:49.528 --> 22:53.465
could be seen in every
aspect of the company.

22:53.465 --> 22:55.501
* Oh my love *

22:55.501 --> 22:58.671
We had 15 clubs operating
within the United States,

22:58.671 --> 23:02.809
including locations
in Los Angeles and Miami,

23:02.809 --> 23:05.477
and international locations

23:05.477 --> 23:08.948
in Montreal,
Manila, and Jamaica.

23:08.948 --> 23:11.417
Originally, when we
started off the first one

23:11.417 --> 23:12.952
in Chicago back in '59,

23:12.952 --> 23:15.021
we had no notion
it would be so successful.

23:15.021 --> 23:18.024
* So many times *

23:18.024 --> 23:20.492
* You're gonna be lonely *

23:20.492 --> 23:23.595
* So many times
you're gonna be blue *

23:23.595 --> 23:27.333
By the end of the 1960s,
the magazine was selling

23:27.333 --> 23:30.402
an average of 5.5 million
issues per month

23:30.402 --> 23:32.404
and Playboy's profits
had climbed

23:32.404 --> 23:34.306
to $80 million a year.

23:34.306 --> 23:35.775
**

23:35.775 --> 23:39.645
I decided the time had come
to make a big statement

23:39.645 --> 23:43.682
and establish ourselves
as an American institution.

23:43.682 --> 23:45.885
**

23:51.623 --> 23:54.994
So I purchased the
37-floor Palmolive Building

23:54.994 --> 23:59.098
on Michigan Ave.
for $2.7 million

23:59.098 --> 24:03.002
and put our name across it
in nine-foot letters.

24:03.002 --> 24:04.570
* She asked me maybe *

24:04.570 --> 24:06.638
* If I could
share her sorrow *

24:06.638 --> 24:07.940
Not only was it

24:07.940 --> 24:11.077
one of Chicago's
most iconic buildings,

24:11.077 --> 24:13.312
but as a kid,
I'd looked out my window

24:13.312 --> 24:17.716
and seen the spotlight
on top light up the city.

24:17.716 --> 24:19.986
When Hefner puts Playboy

24:19.986 --> 24:22.789
in big, bright shining letters

24:22.789 --> 24:25.024
on the Palmolive Building
in Chicago,

24:25.024 --> 24:29.128
the Playboy brand becomes
part of the skyline.

24:29.128 --> 24:31.397
The argument is over, right?

24:31.397 --> 24:33.332
The empire is now here,

24:33.332 --> 24:35.935
and there's really nothing
you can do about it.

24:35.935 --> 24:37.136
* The promised land *

24:37.136 --> 24:38.771
* Hang on 'til then *

24:38.771 --> 24:41.173
* As best as you can *

24:43.075 --> 24:44.743
Stand on this one, the mark
here that we've placed.

24:44.743 --> 24:48.347
Yeah, that's the one.
Perfect.

24:48.347 --> 24:49.348
Holding the pipe?

24:49.348 --> 24:51.217
Yes.

24:51.217 --> 24:56.856
As for me, after years of
fighting to prove ourselves,

24:56.856 --> 24:58.457
I ended up on the cover

24:58.457 --> 25:04.430
of one of the most
respected publications,

25:04.430 --> 25:06.698
Time magazine.

25:06.698 --> 25:08.167
To make it onto the cover

25:08.167 --> 25:11.904
of Time magazine
in '67 was huge.

25:11.904 --> 25:14.240
This is the recognition
of the establishment

25:14.240 --> 25:17.076
that you are a player,
right?

25:17.076 --> 25:18.177
Presidents are on the cover,

25:18.177 --> 25:20.079
dictators are on the cover,
right?

25:20.079 --> 25:23.549
That's who makes the cover
of Time magazine.

25:25.017 --> 25:27.153
He had arrived.

25:29.655 --> 25:32.859
Being on the cover of Time
validated everything

25:32.859 --> 25:36.562
I'd been doing
for the last 15 years.

25:42.101 --> 25:44.203
Here we have panels
along this wall,

25:44.203 --> 25:45.771
similar to what we use
in the clubs.

25:45.771 --> 25:47.506
It should look nice.
This is the bar.

25:47.506 --> 25:49.408
Made it L-shaped
so we can have people

25:49.408 --> 25:52.011
along both sides
and not miss anything.

25:52.011 --> 25:53.345
Glasses here.

25:53.345 --> 25:56.682
Uh, Bobbie,
we're in a meeting.

25:56.682 --> 25:58.150
Police have issued
an all-points bulletin

25:58.150 --> 25:59.818
for a well-dressed
young white man

25:59.818 --> 26:01.387
seen running
from the scene.

26:01.387 --> 26:03.890
Dr. King was standing
on the balcony

26:03.890 --> 26:05.892
of his second-floor
hotel room tonight

26:05.892 --> 26:08.194
when, according
to a companion,

26:08.194 --> 26:10.662
a shot was fired
from across the street.

26:10.662 --> 26:12.064
In the friend's words,

26:12.064 --> 26:14.100
the bullet exploded
in his face.

26:14.100 --> 26:19.005
April 4th, 1968, was a day
I will never forget.

26:19.005 --> 26:21.040
...in the civil rights
movement

26:21.040 --> 26:22.841
were on the scene
almost immediately.

26:22.841 --> 26:26.145
They rushed the 39-year-old
Negro leader to a hospital,

26:26.145 --> 26:28.981
where he died of
a bullet wound in the neck.

26:28.981 --> 26:31.250
**

26:31.250 --> 26:33.953
The death of
Martin Luther King,

26:33.953 --> 26:39.725
that just seemed
to stop time.

26:39.725 --> 26:42.929
It was horrible,
it was unimaginable,

26:42.929 --> 26:45.064
but you didn't need
to imagine it.

26:45.064 --> 26:47.499
And people
were really saying,

26:47.499 --> 26:53.172
"What kind of world are we in?
What kind of people are we?

26:53.172 --> 26:55.574
Who's gonna
stop this sort of thing?"

26:55.574 --> 26:57.176
**

26:57.176 --> 26:59.711
As riots broke out
across the country,

26:59.711 --> 27:04.183
leaders tried desperately
to calm the nation.

27:04.183 --> 27:06.618
What we need
in the United States

27:06.618 --> 27:08.320
is not division.

27:08.320 --> 27:09.821
What we need
in the United States

27:09.821 --> 27:11.857
is not hatred.

27:11.857 --> 27:15.327
And no speech did more to
bring the country together

27:15.327 --> 27:16.996
than Robert F. Kennedy's...

27:16.996 --> 27:19.365
...but is love and wisdom

27:19.365 --> 27:21.867
and compassion
toward one another.

27:21.867 --> 27:24.536
...who'd experienced his
own brother's assassination

27:24.536 --> 27:26.605
just under
five years earlier.

27:26.605 --> 27:30.142
...within our country,
whether they be white

27:30.142 --> 27:31.978
or whether they be black.

27:40.652 --> 27:43.522
**

28:09.648 --> 28:11.450
Martin Luther King Jr.

28:11.450 --> 28:15.221
was laid to rest
in Atlanta, Georgia.

28:16.822 --> 28:21.560
Over 100,000 people attended
the funeral procession.

28:23.962 --> 28:27.433
The big piece which I think
resonated with my dad

28:27.433 --> 28:31.037
was that Dr. King
had died for something

28:31.037 --> 28:34.873
that was a lot more
than just him,

28:34.873 --> 28:39.411
that he'd given his life
for change...

28:39.411 --> 28:42.114
**

28:42.114 --> 28:46.685
...and that change was the
challenge of finding a way

28:46.685 --> 28:47.853
to live in a world

28:47.853 --> 28:51.890
where people could make
their own choices freely.

28:51.890 --> 28:55.361
**

28:59.665 --> 29:01.400
I knew what a blow

29:01.400 --> 29:04.103
his death was for
the civil rights movement

29:04.103 --> 29:06.372
and the country as a whole,

29:06.372 --> 29:07.706
and I wanted to figure out

29:07.706 --> 29:09.275
the best way
to honor his memory.

29:09.275 --> 29:12.411
"A promised land
of true equality."

29:12.411 --> 29:13.812
Weeks before
his assassination,

29:13.812 --> 29:17.216
Playboy received
an essay from Dr. King

29:17.216 --> 29:20.252
called A Testament of Hope,

29:20.252 --> 29:22.821
a work that would
tragically become

29:22.821 --> 29:25.491
his final written words.

29:25.491 --> 29:27.259
"In his final
published statement,

29:27.259 --> 29:28.994
"the civil rights leader
points the way out

29:28.994 --> 29:30.496
"of America's racial turmoil

29:30.496 --> 29:32.931
into the promised land
of equality."

29:32.931 --> 29:36.034
That's better,
but add "fallen"

29:36.034 --> 29:37.203
before "civil rights leader"

29:37.203 --> 29:39.938
and add "true"
before equality.

29:39.938 --> 29:42.608
We knew that publishing
his passionate words

29:42.608 --> 29:46.545
was the best way
we could honor his legacy.

29:46.545 --> 29:52.118
But soon, another tragedy
rocked the nation.

29:57.289 --> 29:58.990
If there's a doctor
in the house,

29:58.990 --> 30:00.226
I want to see him
right here.

30:00.226 --> 30:02.261
Everybody else,
please stay back.

30:05.297 --> 30:07.833
Oh, no!

30:11.603 --> 30:15.474
Before we could adjust
in any measure

30:15.474 --> 30:19.445
to Dr. King's assassination,
April 4th, 1968,

30:19.445 --> 30:23.382
Robert Kennedy killed
June the 5th in Los Angeles.

30:23.382 --> 30:27.253
It just left us
pained and hurt,

30:27.253 --> 30:30.522
as if all hope
had been lost.

30:30.522 --> 30:33.091
We were numb.

30:33.091 --> 30:37.563
**

30:37.563 --> 30:42.033
Soon, that grief
turned to anger.

30:42.033 --> 30:46.672
* In the early dawn
the Bishop's men *

30:46.672 --> 30:49.107
* Shivered in the damp *

30:49.107 --> 30:52.411
* Who prayed that
wives and families *

30:52.411 --> 30:56.982
* Might see them
once again *

30:56.982 --> 30:59.851
**

31:02.654 --> 31:04.390
In the summer of '68,

31:04.390 --> 31:07.559
the fear and anxiety
of the long hot summer,

31:07.559 --> 31:12.198
you had all of the issues
and all of the anger

31:12.198 --> 31:15.133
that had been building up.

31:15.133 --> 31:17.703
It turns
into absolute mayhem.

31:17.703 --> 31:20.372
* The ground mist hid
the patrol's approach *

31:20.372 --> 31:22.674
* As they drew
close enough to show *

31:22.674 --> 31:25.977
It was a time of revolution
and some of it was violent.

31:25.977 --> 31:28.947
It was a time of questioning
old mores and values.

31:28.947 --> 31:30.916
* Of pure white sand *

31:30.916 --> 31:34.119
It was questioning a lot
of the fundamental views

31:34.119 --> 31:36.322
that people saw were hurtful.

31:36.322 --> 31:39.258
* At evensong
both camps reviewed *

31:39.258 --> 31:41.593
* Their sad depleted ranks *

31:41.593 --> 31:45.964
To make matters worse,
by the summer of 1968,

31:45.964 --> 31:48.900
the Vietnam War was
spiraling out of control.

31:48.900 --> 31:53.205
* Gave God their
grateful thanks *

31:53.205 --> 31:57.443
**

31:57.443 --> 32:01.647
Even while the search
for peace was going on,

32:01.647 --> 32:04.550
North Vietnam
rushed their preparations

32:04.550 --> 32:08.787
for a savage assault
on the people,

32:08.787 --> 32:10.021
the government,

32:10.021 --> 32:13.124
and the allies
of South Vietnam.

32:13.124 --> 32:15.594
The North Vietnamese
launched

32:15.594 --> 32:17.429
their most
brutal campaign yet

32:17.429 --> 32:19.231
against American troops,

32:19.231 --> 32:21.767
a series of
surprise bomb attacks

32:21.767 --> 32:25.937
that would come to be known
as the Tet Offensive.

32:27.739 --> 32:29.808
The Viet Cong
simultaneously attacked

32:29.808 --> 32:33.312
just about every major city
and town in South Vietnam,

32:33.312 --> 32:34.746
and it was a new war.

32:34.746 --> 32:37.783
After over a decade of war,

32:37.783 --> 32:41.453
nearly 20,000 American
soldiers had been killed

32:41.453 --> 32:44.956
and it seemed there
was no end in sight.

32:44.956 --> 32:48.494
**

32:48.494 --> 32:50.195
Just hoping to stay alive
from day to day.

32:50.195 --> 32:52.197
Everybody just wants to go
back home and go to school.

32:52.197 --> 32:53.465
That's about it.

32:53.465 --> 32:54.900
Have you lost any friends?

32:54.900 --> 32:57.503
Quite a few.
We lost one the other day.

32:57.503 --> 32:59.905
This whole thing stinks,
really.

33:02.240 --> 33:07.279
**

33:11.350 --> 33:14.286
But as strongly as
Playboy opposed the war

33:14.286 --> 33:17.022
in the pages
of the magazine,

33:17.022 --> 33:21.727
we knew many of our readers
were stationed overseas,

33:21.727 --> 33:24.463
and we wanted to do
what we could to help.

33:24.463 --> 33:27.766
* One, two, three, four
sha la la la la la *

33:27.766 --> 33:29.835
We teamed up with the USO,

33:29.835 --> 33:34.205
sending our 1965 Playmate
of the Year, Jo Collins,

33:34.205 --> 33:36.174
to visit the soldiers.

33:36.174 --> 33:38.577
Miss Jo Collins,
ladies and gentlemen.

33:40.379 --> 33:44.850
So, Lieutenant Jack Price
of the 173rd Airborne Brigade

33:44.850 --> 33:46.785
in Vietnam sent a letter
to Hugh Hefner,

33:46.785 --> 33:48.387
saying that
him and his company

33:48.387 --> 33:51.923
wanted to chip in $150 to
have the Playmate of the Year

33:51.923 --> 33:53.825
deliver a lifetime
subscription,

33:53.825 --> 33:56.828
so we flew over to Saigon
and delivered it.

33:56.828 --> 33:58.797
Isn't that a sweet story?

34:00.265 --> 34:02.601
* Two, three, four *

34:02.601 --> 34:05.036
* Sha la la la la la
live for today *

34:05.036 --> 34:08.106
It was a uniquely Playboy
way to build morale,

34:08.106 --> 34:10.342
and while it wasn't
going to bring them home,

34:10.342 --> 34:12.878
I hoped it could at least
brighten the mood

34:12.878 --> 34:15.647
of the men fighting for our
country, even momentarily.

34:15.647 --> 34:17.549
* Sha la la la la la
live for today *

34:17.549 --> 34:19.785
* Live for today *

34:22.588 --> 34:24.890
Also, we thought
it would be fun

34:24.890 --> 34:28.126
to have two floors and see
how that opens up the space.

34:28.126 --> 34:31.763
1968 had been
a year of chaos.

34:31.763 --> 34:34.833
It was clear that Americans
had grown disheartened

34:34.833 --> 34:38.404
by what they were
seeing on TV,

34:38.404 --> 34:40.205
so I came up with an idea

34:40.205 --> 34:43.341
that could help
lift the mood a little...

34:43.341 --> 34:46.177
**

34:46.177 --> 34:50.516
bringing Playboy
back to television.

34:50.516 --> 34:52.984
My last TV show,
Playboy's Penthouse,

34:52.984 --> 34:56.187
had lasted two seasons
and brought together

34:56.187 --> 34:59.625
some of the best names
in jazz and culture,

34:59.625 --> 35:02.894
but Playboy had changed
throughout the past decade

35:02.894 --> 35:05.764
and I wanted a new
generation to experience

35:05.764 --> 35:08.767
the lifestyle
for themselves.

35:08.767 --> 35:11.537
On this new show,
I would invite guests

35:11.537 --> 35:13.038
from all walks of life

35:13.038 --> 35:15.774
that could appeal to
our younger audience.

35:15.774 --> 35:18.644
But I knew if I wanted
to get the biggest names,

35:18.644 --> 35:20.946
I couldn't stay in Chicago,

35:20.946 --> 35:25.016
so I set my sights
on Los Angeles.

35:25.016 --> 35:28.019
* What can you see
with your ear on ground *

35:28.019 --> 35:30.221
* Try to lift up
your feet, girl *

35:30.221 --> 35:32.724
* And take a look around
oh let me see you... *

35:32.724 --> 35:35.326
For years, Hollywood
had been synonymous

35:35.326 --> 35:38.564
with the film industry,

35:38.564 --> 35:40.499
but the city
was also becoming

35:40.499 --> 35:42.434
a major culture center
for art,

35:42.434 --> 35:44.903
music, and now television.

35:44.903 --> 35:47.873
* Yeah, your mind is... *

35:47.873 --> 35:50.676
Shows like Laugh-In,

35:50.676 --> 35:53.479
The Smothers Brothers,

35:53.479 --> 35:55.113
and The Carol Burnett Show

35:55.113 --> 35:57.949
represented
a changing culture,

35:57.949 --> 36:01.186
and I knew Playboy
would fit right in.

36:01.186 --> 36:02.220
* Hey *

36:02.220 --> 36:06.692
**

36:09.628 --> 36:12.197
In 1969, we signed a deal

36:12.197 --> 36:15.200
to film 26 episodes
of a new show

36:15.200 --> 36:17.035
at CBS Television City.

36:17.035 --> 36:19.705
We'd call it
Playboy After Dark.

36:19.705 --> 36:22.440
All right, stand by.
Quiet. Shh!

36:22.440 --> 36:23.709
Playboy After Dark.

36:23.709 --> 36:26.878
Airdate TBA.
Take one.

36:26.878 --> 36:28.814
Hi, I'm Hugh Hefner,

36:28.814 --> 36:30.482
your host
on a weekly series

36:30.482 --> 36:32.450
of swinging parties
called Playboy After Dark.

36:32.450 --> 36:34.452
The great names of
show business will perform,

36:34.452 --> 36:36.988
and I hope you'll be
able to be part of the scene.

36:36.988 --> 36:39.658
As soon as I arrived
in Los Angeles,

36:39.658 --> 36:42.594
we immediately
started shooting.

36:42.594 --> 36:44.429
It's nighttime
fun and games

36:44.429 --> 36:48.166
on Playboy After Dark,
and the action is wild.

36:48.166 --> 36:53.805
**

36:53.805 --> 36:55.741
Hef always believed in

36:55.741 --> 36:59.044
and always knew the power
of the television.

36:59.044 --> 37:00.445
**

37:00.445 --> 37:02.614
He had a real understanding

37:02.614 --> 37:05.016
of youth culture
and pop culture.

37:08.286 --> 37:10.622
It seemed like
the pent-up energy

37:10.622 --> 37:12.758
everyone had shared
over the last few years

37:12.758 --> 37:14.225
was ready to explode

37:14.225 --> 37:16.895
into something new
and different.

37:16.895 --> 37:19.765
**

37:27.539 --> 37:28.840
Who gets the espresso?

37:33.812 --> 37:37.549
He had people from all walks
of life on the show,

37:37.549 --> 37:41.219
whether they were
entertainers or thinkers.

37:41.219 --> 37:44.089
He mixed all kinds of people

37:44.089 --> 37:47.025
and it was just
an interesting show.

37:47.025 --> 37:48.560
First, I want to say

37:48.560 --> 37:50.495
that I'm gonna come
back on this show often,

37:50.495 --> 37:52.197
because it's the first show
I've ever been on in my life

37:52.197 --> 37:53.932
where I can plug a book
and get zonked

37:53.932 --> 37:55.433
all at the same time.

37:57.002 --> 38:00.205
This generation
was tuning in.

38:00.205 --> 38:01.339
We even paid tribute

38:01.339 --> 38:03.074
to the psychedelic
drug culture,

38:03.074 --> 38:05.210
inviting bands
like The Grateful Dead

38:05.210 --> 38:06.612
to appear show.

38:06.612 --> 38:10.181
* Boogie down
until the end *

38:10.181 --> 38:13.051
The magazine had
a core DNA to it

38:13.051 --> 38:17.222
that could adapt to culture,
could adapt to, you know,

38:17.222 --> 38:20.158
an America that had
changed rapidly for years

38:20.158 --> 38:23.028
and still be relevant and
find new ways to be relevant.

38:23.028 --> 38:28.834
And I think that's what helped
Playboy endure for so long.

38:28.834 --> 38:32.103
Playboy After Dark
became an instant success

38:32.103 --> 38:35.006
and gave our readers
a weekly opportunity

38:35.006 --> 38:36.541
to forget
about the problems

38:36.541 --> 38:39.878
of their daily life,

38:39.878 --> 38:41.446
but I had no idea

38:41.446 --> 38:45.116
what the show
was about to give me.

38:45.116 --> 38:47.252
Because on that very set,

38:47.252 --> 38:49.788
among the dozens
of beautiful women

38:49.788 --> 38:52.057
and celebrity guests,

38:52.057 --> 38:56.194
I was about to meet
the love of my life.

38:56.194 --> 38:59.064
**

39:00.966 --> 39:04.736
* Every little movement *

39:04.736 --> 39:09.074
* Every motion of your hips *

39:09.074 --> 39:11.910
* I feel the compulsion *

39:11.910 --> 39:17.582
* To pull you
to my sweet lips *

39:17.582 --> 39:21.687
* Is it a black magic spell *

39:21.687 --> 39:24.823
* You put me under? *

39:24.823 --> 39:28.493
* This miracle moment *

39:28.493 --> 39:32.698
* Never let it end *

39:32.698 --> 39:36.702
* Every little movement *

39:36.702 --> 39:40.772
* Is beyond improvement *

39:40.772 --> 39:43.408
* You are the magician *

39:43.408 --> 39:48.513
* I've been wishing for
forever *

39:48.513 --> 39:52.617
* Every
little movement *

39:52.617 --> 39:56.688
* Every little movement **
