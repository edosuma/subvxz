00:00.101 --> 00:01.800
Previously on <i>Royal Pains</i>...

00:01.825 --> 00:03.025
You're going to prison.

00:03.050 --> 00:05.150
- I'm Shaw.
- Shaw.

00:05.175 --> 00:07.475
You know that he helped me get
through, he was my only friend?

00:07.500 --> 00:10.100
- You think he's changed?
- Yeah, it's like he's lost...

00:10.125 --> 00:12.625
- Shaw's a father?
- That's why he's going to Austin.

00:12.650 --> 00:13.850
To be with his kid.

00:13.875 --> 00:15.475
Maybe I could swim there...

00:15.500 --> 00:18.000
Disorientation's a symptom
of lead poisoning.

00:18.001 --> 00:19.034
Hey, have you seen the patient?

00:19.036 --> 00:20.536
He wanted to swim to Austin.

00:20.538 --> 00:21.570
Okay, look, the beach. Let's go.

00:21.572 --> 00:23.606
I'm gonna propose to Paige.

00:23.608 --> 00:25.074
Before you give her mom's ring,

00:25.076 --> 00:26.408
make sure you really know her.

00:26.410 --> 00:29.245
Boys, meet Ted Ross, your grandfather.

00:29.247 --> 00:30.412
What?

00:30.414 --> 00:31.914
Oh, you did it.

00:31.916 --> 00:33.716
You have a beautiful boy.

00:33.718 --> 00:35.017
We made arrangements for the cord blood.

00:35.019 --> 00:36.919
Our driver will take you now.

00:36.921 --> 00:38.187
Would you care for a drink?

00:38.189 --> 00:40.389
Yeah, maybe after...

00:52.303 --> 00:53.536
- Jill Casey.
- What about her?

00:53.538 --> 00:57.339
I'm looking at her.

00:57.341 --> 00:58.908
Blood's not hers.

00:58.910 --> 01:01.510
At the scene of a M.V.A.,
two occupants, trauma stat...

01:01.512 --> 01:02.878
We gotta intubate now.

01:02.880 --> 01:04.379
Proceeding with R.S.I. protocol.

01:04.382 --> 01:06.649
ETA ten minutes.

01:06.651 --> 01:09.485
5'11", about 170 pounds.

01:09.487 --> 01:11.020
What about his medical status?

01:11.022 --> 01:13.556
Severe lead poisoning is confirmed.

01:13.558 --> 01:15.124
What does that mean, exactly?

01:15.126 --> 01:16.592
It means time is of the essence.

01:16.594 --> 01:17.660
With each passing moment,

01:17.662 --> 01:19.128
Mr. Morgan is more and more at risk

01:19.130 --> 01:22.097
for seizures, coma, and death.

01:22.099 --> 01:23.933
You really think he could be
out there somewhere?

01:23.935 --> 01:25.034
Well, we're looking.

01:25.036 --> 01:26.335
We have an officer stationed

01:26.337 --> 01:27.703
outside his door right now.

01:27.705 --> 01:30.472
Uh, any idea where else he might be?

01:32.475 --> 01:34.777
Edward.

01:34.779 --> 01:38.480
Answer the officer.

01:38.482 --> 01:39.915
He wanted to get to Austin.

01:39.917 --> 01:41.483
He has a baby daughter there,

01:41.485 --> 01:43.152
and he's been talking about her a lot.

01:43.154 --> 01:45.287
Hmm.

01:45.289 --> 01:46.922
- Thank you, officer.
- Yep.

01:46.924 --> 01:50.426
The Palm Beach Police
Department may not know

01:50.428 --> 01:52.127
that you're past curfew.

01:52.129 --> 01:55.464
But the Bureau of Prisons certainly will.

01:55.466 --> 01:57.032
Edward, let's go back to the house.

01:57.034 --> 01:58.701
Look, I only need a few more minutes.

01:58.703 --> 02:01.170
If Shaw is out here,
I need to be out here.

02:01.172 --> 02:04.139
You break the rules,
you do so at your own peril.

02:07.243 --> 02:09.178
Well, uh, nice meeting you...

02:09.180 --> 02:10.179
Ted.

02:10.181 --> 02:11.513
Yeah, yeah.

02:11.515 --> 02:13.682
Yeah, I look forward to getting to know

02:13.684 --> 02:15.351
my long-lost grandfather.

02:15.353 --> 02:18.020
It's not my fault that I'm long lost.

02:21.591 --> 02:23.626
It's a long story. Trust me.

02:23.628 --> 02:25.694
Right now, please, let's go find Shaw.

02:25.696 --> 02:27.262
Look, I will find Shaw

02:27.264 --> 02:29.398
and let you know when I do.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.167
Evan will make sure
you get home safely and quickly.

02:32.169 --> 02:34.069
Sure.

02:40.844 --> 02:43.479
How much rest do they need, exactly?

02:43.481 --> 02:45.547
I know you're eager
to get back in there again

02:45.549 --> 02:46.882
and hold your son.

02:46.884 --> 02:49.685
But you won't have to wait long.

02:49.687 --> 02:51.854
He and Marisa are both doing very well.

02:51.856 --> 02:54.289
Thanks to you, Ms. Katdare.

02:54.291 --> 02:56.892
I was doing my job.

02:56.894 --> 02:59.528
Well, you did it quite well.

02:59.530 --> 03:02.264
And under fairly chaotic circumstances.

03:02.266 --> 03:06.268
Well, the chaos has passed now.

03:12.208 --> 03:13.275
Jeff, Jeff.

03:13.277 --> 03:14.576
What happened to her?

03:14.578 --> 03:16.078
Hit-and-run out on town line.

03:16.080 --> 03:18.013
Found her and the driver
both unconscious.

03:18.015 --> 03:19.381
- What's the status?
- G.C.S. of 8,

03:19.383 --> 03:20.349
but stable vital signs.

03:20.351 --> 03:23.719
Intubated to protect the airway.

03:34.531 --> 03:38.767
- Lawson!
- Hey.

03:38.769 --> 03:40.235
Thank you.

03:40.237 --> 03:42.071
You been walking all night?

03:42.073 --> 03:43.505
Shaw's been missing all night.

03:43.507 --> 03:45.841
God, yeah, dad's freaking out about it.

03:45.843 --> 03:48.277
But at least he's freaking at home.

03:48.279 --> 03:50.312
Yeah.

03:50.314 --> 03:53.549
Did you get any details
about the 40-year family rift?

03:53.551 --> 03:57.519
So apparently, our... Ted...

03:57.521 --> 03:59.955
is a very stubborn man.

03:59.957 --> 04:01.657
Dad thought they were never
gonna talk again.

04:01.659 --> 04:03.859
What prompted the reunion?

04:03.861 --> 04:05.627
Dad became eligible for home detention,

04:05.629 --> 04:07.329
and he needed a credible sponsor.

04:07.331 --> 04:08.597
Plus, he figured, well,

04:08.599 --> 04:09.498
he'd made amends with us already,

04:09.500 --> 04:11.867
so he was on a roll, man.

04:11.869 --> 04:12.868
Oh, yeah.

04:12.870 --> 04:14.603
Glad we ignited his hot streak.

04:14.605 --> 04:15.604
Yeah.

04:15.606 --> 04:16.971
And our...

04:16.974 --> 04:19.341
Ted just agreed to it,

04:19.343 --> 04:21.110
after not seeing him for four decades?

04:21.112 --> 04:22.077
No.

04:22.079 --> 04:23.946
He wanted something in return.

04:23.948 --> 04:26.014
What?

04:26.016 --> 04:29.818
He wanted to meet his grandsons.

04:29.820 --> 04:31.620
And a deal was made.

04:31.622 --> 04:33.789
A quiet deal.

04:33.791 --> 04:35.858
Our Ted is very concerned
with perception,

04:35.860 --> 04:37.259
and he doesn't exactly want
Palm Beach society

04:37.261 --> 04:38.427
knowing that he's...

04:38.429 --> 04:40.863
harboring his son, the convicted fraud.

04:40.865 --> 04:43.599
I was gonna put it
a little differently, but...

04:43.601 --> 04:45.000
Sorry, the exhaustion and heat stroke

04:45.002 --> 04:46.235
have me a little off my game.

04:46.237 --> 04:48.537
I get it.

04:48.539 --> 04:51.507
And I may not be alone.

04:54.077 --> 04:57.179
Shaw!

05:01.151 --> 05:03.185
- Is he alive?
- Shaw!

05:03.187 --> 05:04.219
Shaw!

05:04.221 --> 05:06.755
Eddie.

05:06.757 --> 05:08.457
You're always there for me.

05:08.459 --> 05:09.925
Call for help. Fast.

05:09.927 --> 05:11.627
Yep.

05:32.839 --> 05:35.839
Royal Pains 3x05 - A Man Called Grandpa

Sync and corrected by atrn97g
www.addic7ed.com

05:38.948 --> 05:41.516
Got it. Thank you.

05:45.289 --> 05:48.257
We gotta cool him down.

05:52.563 --> 05:54.863
Evan, grab those palm fronds over there.

06:00.036 --> 06:01.904
- Come.
- What about you?

06:01.906 --> 06:03.472
All right, just keep fanning him.

06:03.474 --> 06:05.007
It'll help with evaporation.

06:05.009 --> 06:06.208
- Got it.
- Gina?

06:06.210 --> 06:09.111
I need to see my daughter.

06:09.113 --> 06:11.013
Shaw, right now,
the only thing you need to do

06:11.015 --> 06:13.015
is get your body temperature
back to normal.

06:13.017 --> 06:14.149
Hank, the cavalry.

06:14.151 --> 06:17.853
Over here!

06:17.855 --> 06:20.522
Diagnosed with lead poisoning
and altered mental status,

06:20.524 --> 06:21.957
found with signs of heat stroke.

06:21.959 --> 06:24.092
Pulse notes marked tachychardia.

06:24.094 --> 06:26.828
Patient needs continued
treatment for hyperthermia,

06:26.830 --> 06:27.996
hydration, and chelation therapy.

06:27.998 --> 06:30.365
Okay, guys, let's turn him around.

06:30.367 --> 06:33.035
And lift.

06:33.037 --> 06:34.169
Which vehicle are we going to?

06:34.171 --> 06:35.337
Right here. Set him down.

06:35.339 --> 06:36.571
Yep.

06:36.573 --> 06:37.806
Let's get ready to roll.

06:37.808 --> 06:39.608
Yep.

06:39.610 --> 06:41.143
Shaw, they're pulling you.

06:41.145 --> 06:44.112
We'll see you at the hospital.

07:03.533 --> 07:05.434
Jill.

07:05.436 --> 07:07.536
Hey.

07:07.538 --> 07:09.171
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

07:09.173 --> 07:11.907
You were in an accident in Boris' car.

07:11.909 --> 07:13.642
But you are gonna be fine.

07:13.644 --> 07:17.579
I've called your family,
and they're on their way.

07:17.581 --> 07:19.681
Jill, it's good to see you're awake.

07:19.683 --> 07:22.250
The preliminary results
of your pan-scan are negative.

07:22.252 --> 07:24.686
You were intubated in the field

07:24.688 --> 07:26.321
because they found you unconscious.

07:26.323 --> 07:28.323
FIO2 is less than 0.5,

07:28.325 --> 07:31.293
and patient/ventilator rate
is less than 30.

07:31.295 --> 07:33.528
So we can slowly start
to wean you off this thing.

07:33.530 --> 07:35.597
What?

07:35.599 --> 07:37.032
No, no, no.

07:37.034 --> 07:38.767
Well, now, you're just getting
greedy, Ms. Casey.

07:38.769 --> 07:40.002
I said slowly.

07:40.004 --> 07:41.970
I'll have respiratory therapy

07:41.972 --> 07:43.372
start decreasing the I.M.V.,

07:43.374 --> 07:45.073
and we'll see how you do from there.

07:45.075 --> 07:46.575
That's our policy.

07:46.577 --> 07:49.311
And I know how much
our hospital administrator

07:49.313 --> 07:51.480
believes in playing by the rules.

08:00.256 --> 08:03.358
Florida certainly has been
full of surprises.

08:03.360 --> 08:04.960
Grandpa we didn't know was alive.

08:04.962 --> 08:06.428
Dad's new millionaire friend.

08:06.430 --> 08:07.629
Oh, the fact that you don't like Paige.

08:07.631 --> 08:09.798
That was new.

08:09.800 --> 08:10.799
That's not what I said.

08:10.801 --> 08:12.034
- Okay.
- Look.

08:12.036 --> 08:13.035
I know that conversation didn't turn out

08:13.037 --> 08:14.036
the way you wanted it to.

08:14.038 --> 08:15.237
No, it didn't.

08:15.239 --> 08:16.538
- And I know that hurt you.
- Yes, it did.

08:16.540 --> 08:18.006
But...

08:18.008 --> 08:19.341
but let's just leave that
aside right now.

08:19.343 --> 08:20.042
We have to focus on dad's parole.

08:20.044 --> 08:21.543
Agreed.

08:21.545 --> 08:23.011
We just need to make sure
he obeys his curfew

08:23.013 --> 08:24.312
and plays by the rules.

08:24.314 --> 08:25.547
Um, we also need to make sure

08:25.549 --> 08:26.815
his own father doesn't throw him
under the bus

08:26.817 --> 08:28.116
at the parole hearing.

08:28.118 --> 08:29.951
And how do you suggest we do that?

08:29.953 --> 08:32.220
We need to show Ted
how much our dad means to us.

08:32.222 --> 08:33.455
And how do you suggest we do that?

08:33.457 --> 08:35.090
Well, it's funny you should ask,

08:35.092 --> 08:36.124
because I came up with that
very plan just last night.

08:36.126 --> 08:37.826
A plan? What plan?

08:49.306 --> 08:51.106
- So.
- Hmm?

08:51.108 --> 08:53.375
The Roths do pretty well for themselves.

08:53.377 --> 08:56.278
Too bad you're a Lawson.

08:56.280 --> 08:58.346
Oh.

08:58.348 --> 09:02.384
Tell me about this little
start-up business you guys have.

09:02.386 --> 09:05.020
It's high-quality healthcare
delivered to your doorstep.

09:05.022 --> 09:06.321
Ah.

09:06.323 --> 09:07.456
It's the future of medicine, basically.

09:07.458 --> 09:08.857
And the business plan actually works.

09:08.859 --> 09:11.526
Well, in the Hamptons,
I shouldn't wonder.

09:11.528 --> 09:15.664
It seems success skips a generation.

09:15.666 --> 09:16.898
Hmm?

09:16.900 --> 09:19.568
Unfortunately, yeah,

09:19.570 --> 09:21.036
we had to leave our clients
somewhat unattended

09:21.038 --> 09:22.771
for an entire weekend
'cause we had to come down here

09:22.773 --> 09:24.005
and help our dad.

09:24.007 --> 09:25.240
Yeah.

09:25.242 --> 09:27.409
Let's save some time, Evan.

09:27.411 --> 09:30.112
We both know that you didn't
invite me to lunch

09:30.114 --> 09:31.880
so you could get to know me.

09:31.882 --> 09:35.050
Admirable as that may be.

09:35.052 --> 09:36.384
You have an agenda,

09:36.386 --> 09:37.586
and you wanna sweet-talk me on board.

09:37.588 --> 09:39.921
- You're half right.
- Hm.

09:39.923 --> 09:42.457
We love our dad,
and we'd do anything for him.

09:42.459 --> 09:43.725
And he deserves a break.

09:43.727 --> 09:46.561
But also,

09:46.563 --> 09:50.298
I would like to get to know you... Ted.

09:52.503 --> 09:55.237
Where shall we have lunch?

09:55.239 --> 09:56.838
I'm a tourist here. It's your call.

09:56.840 --> 09:58.473
You like horses?

09:58.475 --> 10:01.877
I had something a little less
gamey in mind.

10:03.947 --> 10:06.581
Your father and I insisted
on coming here.

10:25.668 --> 10:27.169
Dr. Redliner.

10:27.171 --> 10:31.072
You are just in time to save
a patient in need.

10:31.074 --> 10:33.208
Casey family reunion.

10:33.210 --> 10:36.344
Yeah, I think she'd prefer
rest to a reunion right now.

10:36.346 --> 10:38.647
Maybe you can announce
that visiting hours are over.

10:38.649 --> 10:40.282
We need privacy to go over the results

10:40.284 --> 10:42.551
from radiology anyway.

10:46.355 --> 10:49.090
Why don't I let her know?

10:49.092 --> 10:51.359
All right.

11:04.440 --> 11:07.242
It's a fluoroscopy.

11:07.244 --> 11:09.211
An imaging technique to help the surgeon

11:09.213 --> 11:11.279
locate and remove all the lead fragments

11:11.281 --> 11:14.149
from Shaw's body.

11:14.151 --> 11:15.450
He's gonna be okay.

11:15.452 --> 11:20.055
I promise you.

11:20.057 --> 11:23.592
You know how I didn't want
you and Evan to come down here?

11:23.594 --> 11:25.026
Yeah?

11:25.028 --> 11:26.595
Let me just say that I'm really glad

11:26.597 --> 11:31.967
disobedience runs in our family.

11:31.969 --> 11:33.635
I've been on my own so long,

11:33.637 --> 11:37.505
I... I thought I didn't need anybody.

11:37.507 --> 11:41.343
I thought I could just put this
all back together myself.

11:41.345 --> 11:42.777
Put what back together?

11:42.779 --> 11:45.080
Everything.

11:45.082 --> 11:47.148
My life.

11:47.150 --> 11:50.485
Then things with dad, then with all of us.

11:50.487 --> 11:54.189
Oh, I had a plan.

11:54.191 --> 11:56.524
Sometimes I am amazed

11:56.526 --> 11:59.027
at how complicated
I make things for myself.

12:12.623 --> 12:14.390
He's way out in front

12:14.392 --> 12:16.693
by a length and a half!

12:19.130 --> 12:20.897
Plus she's a polo player.

12:20.899 --> 12:22.432
And an animal lover.

12:22.434 --> 12:24.868
So you can imagine my relief
to see that we're here

12:24.870 --> 12:28.271
to watch horses and not snack on them.

12:28.273 --> 12:31.207
Well, with everything
you've told me about Paige,

12:31.209 --> 12:33.710
it seems like you really picked a winner.

12:33.712 --> 12:35.678
Yeah, I did. I really did.

12:35.680 --> 12:38.715
And having done that...

12:38.717 --> 12:40.450
let's see if you can do it again.

12:40.452 --> 12:44.120
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

12:44.122 --> 12:46.189
All right.

12:46.191 --> 12:48.691
"Osborne's Gypsy"?
Who names these horses?

12:48.693 --> 12:50.727
Mm-hmm.

12:50.729 --> 12:52.095
A horse called "Man".

12:53.565 --> 12:55.932
Why pick a 50-to-1 long shot?

12:55.934 --> 12:58.234
Because when I was, like, seven,

12:58.236 --> 13:00.303
on a really hot, humid day,

13:00.305 --> 13:02.171
the air-conditioning
in our house broke down.

13:02.173 --> 13:03.473
Yeah?

13:03.475 --> 13:05.942
So my dad came home early from work

13:05.944 --> 13:06.910
to take me to the movies.

13:06.912 --> 13:08.244
Yeah?

13:08.246 --> 13:09.679
'Cause the theaters had air-conditioning.

13:09.681 --> 13:11.948
Is this an answer or an autobiography?

13:11.950 --> 13:14.684
The movie we saw was
<i>The Empire Strikes Back.</i>

13:14.686 --> 13:16.185
Yeah.

13:16.187 --> 13:18.154
It was directed by a guy
named Irvin Kershner,

13:18.156 --> 13:19.556
who also directed...

13:19.558 --> 13:22.025
<i>The Return of a Man Called Horse</i>.

13:22.027 --> 13:25.361
You're saying the horse

13:25.363 --> 13:29.632
has fate on its side.

13:29.634 --> 13:31.434
Yeah, I guess I am.

13:31.436 --> 13:35.138
Well, in that event,

13:35.140 --> 13:38.908
put that on a horse called man.

13:42.279 --> 13:43.446
To win.

13:43.448 --> 13:44.514
To win?

13:44.516 --> 13:48.718
Okay.

13:48.720 --> 13:51.521
To win.

13:51.523 --> 13:54.724
Holy crap.

13:54.726 --> 13:56.759
Everything is fine, Hank.

13:56.761 --> 13:58.227
I should fly back.

13:58.229 --> 14:00.597
No, you can't.
Your dad needs you down there.

14:00.599 --> 14:02.732
Maybe Evan can cover the hearing.

14:02.734 --> 14:04.968
I mean, I should probably be
there for Boris.

14:04.970 --> 14:06.803
And I should definitely
be there for Jill.

14:06.805 --> 14:08.538
My God.

14:08.540 --> 14:11.307
You cannot entrust
your father's liberty to Evan.

14:11.309 --> 14:12.508
Jill is fine.

14:12.510 --> 14:14.110
No major traumas.

14:14.112 --> 14:16.212
Boris' baby is fine.

14:16.214 --> 14:18.748
No repeat T.T.N.,
and his vitals are good.

14:18.750 --> 14:21.317
I promise you, Hank,
I have everything under control.

14:21.319 --> 14:23.019
And you know what?

14:23.021 --> 14:24.921
If that changes,
I'll book your flight myself.

14:24.923 --> 14:27.023
Divya, I don't feel good
about being here...

14:27.025 --> 14:30.259
I will send Boris and Marisa
your best wishes.

14:30.261 --> 14:32.929
I will have Jill call you
as soon as she's extubated.

14:32.931 --> 14:34.497
How does that sound?

14:34.499 --> 14:38.534
It sounds fine...ish.

14:38.536 --> 14:40.403
Thank you, Divya.
I'll be back tomorrow night.

14:40.405 --> 14:41.771
I'll talk to you soon.

14:41.773 --> 14:43.172
Okay.

14:44.509 --> 14:48.911
The radiologist saw a blush on the C.T.

14:48.913 --> 14:51.648
She wants to run it again in a few hours

14:51.650 --> 14:53.282
to see whether it is a hemorrhage

14:53.284 --> 14:56.819
or just an anomaly.

14:56.821 --> 14:58.788
Jill, I'm sorry.

14:58.790 --> 15:02.125
Dr. Redliner wants you intubated
for 24 hours.

15:02.127 --> 15:06.929
And he is right.

15:06.931 --> 15:09.932
Okay, okay, okay.

15:14.838 --> 15:17.640
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't.

15:17.642 --> 15:21.611
I have no privileges here.

15:21.613 --> 15:24.313
Jill, please. Try to be calm.

15:34.526 --> 15:35.758
Are you insane?!

15:37.996 --> 15:39.162
Who does that?

15:41.599 --> 15:43.299
I offered you first crack at it.

15:47.572 --> 15:50.540
I am so furious at you.

15:53.477 --> 15:57.146
And incredibly relieved
to see you being... you.

15:57.148 --> 15:58.981
I'm sorry.

16:01.352 --> 16:04.287
What happened to me, exactly?

16:04.289 --> 16:07.356
It was a hit-and-run. An SUV.

16:07.358 --> 16:10.126
You don't remember anything?

16:10.128 --> 16:11.728
No.

16:11.730 --> 16:14.697
It's weird and fuzzy.

16:18.302 --> 16:21.037
The last thing I remember is...

16:21.039 --> 16:24.140
Is what?

16:24.142 --> 16:28.411
Flashlights.

16:28.413 --> 16:30.546
The surgery got the pellets of lead,

16:30.548 --> 16:32.515
but you'll have to keep doing
these chelation treatments

16:32.517 --> 16:35.151
until all the trace amounts
are flushed from your system.

16:35.153 --> 16:36.819
How's the chelation work?

16:36.821 --> 16:38.588
Well, once it's in the bloodstream,

16:38.590 --> 16:40.623
it traps the lead and forms a compound

16:40.625 --> 16:43.860
that the body can expel
through the urine.

16:43.862 --> 16:45.394
Do you have any other questions, Shaw?

16:45.396 --> 16:46.863
Yeah.

16:46.865 --> 16:48.231
Where's Eddie?

16:48.233 --> 16:51.134
Well, if you're here,
he can't be too far away.

16:51.136 --> 16:52.902
When I find him, I'll send him up.

16:52.904 --> 16:55.905
I guess I missed my flight to Austin.

16:55.907 --> 16:58.508
Your dad was pretty determined
to get my on that plane,

16:58.510 --> 17:00.510
despite everything
that was working against it.

17:00.512 --> 17:02.044
Yeah, my dad's not too good

17:02.046 --> 17:04.781
at taking no for an answer.

17:04.782 --> 17:09.050
It's one of his best qualities.

17:09.053 --> 17:10.553
It's a horse called "Man"
on the inside rail.

17:10.555 --> 17:12.021
Oh, my God, he is.
He's in front, he's in front!

17:12.022 --> 17:13.823
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

17:13.825 --> 17:15.391
And they're into the stretch.

17:15.393 --> 17:18.327
A horse called "Man" is going all-out.

17:18.329 --> 17:19.462
Here comes "The Wizard of Westwood".

17:19.464 --> 17:21.364
No. Number two.

17:21.366 --> 17:24.000
A horse called "Man"
is tearing down the stretch.

17:24.002 --> 17:25.334
Oh, my God, oh, my God. Oh, my God!

17:25.336 --> 17:27.236
It's gonna be a close race.

17:29.340 --> 17:31.607
It's a horse called "Man" by a nose!

17:31.609 --> 17:33.743
Oh, my God! He won!

17:33.745 --> 17:35.678
All right, let's go.
Let's get down there.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.814
- Down where?
- Down to the track.

17:37.816 --> 17:39.215
Have our picture taken with the winner.

17:39.217 --> 17:40.349
They'll let us do that?

17:40.351 --> 17:42.151
They better. I own that horse.

17:42.153 --> 17:44.120
You own your own racehorse?

17:44.122 --> 17:45.555
I own three of them.

17:45.557 --> 17:47.256
This was the only one left
who hadn't won yet.

17:47.258 --> 17:49.358
A horse called "Man"?

17:49.360 --> 17:53.930
Who do you think schooled
your father on Kershner?

17:53.932 --> 17:55.765
Thank God something stuck.

17:55.767 --> 17:57.166
So this is, like...

17:57.168 --> 17:58.467
this is bigger than I thought it was.

17:58.469 --> 17:59.502
This is huge.

17:59.504 --> 18:01.304
- Yeah.
- We should celebrate.

18:01.306 --> 18:02.638
I agree.

18:02.640 --> 18:05.474
How about over dinner?
Just the four of us?

18:05.476 --> 18:07.610
Good, good, good. We'll eat at my place.

18:07.612 --> 18:08.911
Awesome.

18:08.913 --> 18:12.949
My chef makes
a fantastic stallion parmesan.

18:15.118 --> 18:16.385
Wow.

18:16.387 --> 18:17.820
- Mm, good story, huh?
- Great picture.

18:17.822 --> 18:20.223
You can't even tell
that Evan's terrified of horses.

18:20.225 --> 18:21.390
Oh, ho, ho.

18:21.392 --> 18:22.925
I guess I never met a horse

18:22.927 --> 18:24.460
that could generate revenue
before, that's all.

18:24.462 --> 18:26.429
Yeah, well, you should meet
some of my thoroughbreds.

18:26.431 --> 18:27.597
Wow.

18:27.599 --> 18:29.298
Oh, there's our cue. Let's sit.

18:29.300 --> 18:33.402
Okay.

18:33.404 --> 18:35.104
Well, it definitely beats
the early bird special

18:35.106 --> 18:37.173
at the olive garden.

18:37.175 --> 18:39.175
Ev, where's dad?

18:39.177 --> 18:40.877
He said he had to take a call.

18:40.879 --> 18:42.879
I'm sure your father will join us

18:42.881 --> 18:46.616
when it's most convenient for him.

18:46.618 --> 18:49.785
Uh, I'll let him know we're ready.

18:49.787 --> 18:51.487
- That was Shaw.
- What about him?

18:51.489 --> 18:54.156
He just checked himself out
of the hospital.

18:54.158 --> 18:56.392
Well, you need to tell him
to check himself back in.

18:56.394 --> 18:58.694
No, no, I... I know him. He won't listen.

18:58.696 --> 19:00.296
I... I really need your help, Hank.

19:00.298 --> 19:02.064
God, this guy was safer in prison.

19:02.066 --> 19:03.699
Prison?

19:03.701 --> 19:05.401
Edward, what the hell are you doing?

19:05.403 --> 19:07.303
You know what?
I'm trying to save a friend.

19:07.305 --> 19:09.005
Friend? He's an ex-con.

19:09.007 --> 19:11.574
Why don't you ever mind
your own business?

19:11.576 --> 19:13.576
That ship sailed when you begged me

19:13.578 --> 19:16.379
to get right into the middle of it.

19:16.381 --> 19:20.583
You needed another shortcut,
and I was there.

19:20.585 --> 19:21.984
So now I'm telling you,

19:21.986 --> 19:24.320
both as your sponsor and as your father,

19:24.322 --> 19:27.056
you better not walk off this property.

19:27.058 --> 19:29.125
That's exactly what I'm going to do.

19:29.127 --> 19:30.192
In that case,

19:30.194 --> 19:34.130
I won't be at your parole hearing.

19:34.132 --> 19:35.631
Your choice.

19:35.633 --> 19:37.667
Okay, there it is. There it is.

19:37.669 --> 19:40.269
The reason I haven't spoken
to this man for 40 years.

19:40.271 --> 19:41.370
Oh, no, no, no, no.

19:41.372 --> 19:42.605
No, no.

19:42.607 --> 19:45.241
It's because of that woman you knocked up

19:45.243 --> 19:47.043
and then eloped with.

19:47.045 --> 19:48.577
She was after my money,

19:48.579 --> 19:53.149
and she had you
right where she wanted you.

19:53.151 --> 19:54.617
"That woman"?

19:54.619 --> 19:56.185
That woman was my wife.

19:56.187 --> 19:57.987
That woman was their mother.

19:57.989 --> 19:59.889
A far better person than you'll ever be.

19:59.891 --> 20:01.190
I am so happy with my choice,

20:01.192 --> 20:04.060
that I chose her over your damn money.

20:04.062 --> 20:06.128
Hank, please.

20:06.130 --> 20:08.931
Agh.

20:08.933 --> 20:12.034
Well, I should've known.

20:12.036 --> 20:15.071
You can't help someone
who won't help himself.

20:21.311 --> 20:23.279
Dad!

20:26.950 --> 20:28.951
Evan, uh,

20:28.953 --> 20:31.220
you've got to try the sassicaia.

20:31.222 --> 20:33.489
It's magnificent.

20:37.028 --> 20:40.663
If you don't show up
for his parole hearing,

20:40.665 --> 20:42.231
you'll be punishing him,

20:42.233 --> 20:45.101
but you'll be punishing us,
too, you know.

20:45.103 --> 20:47.703
If you feel punished,
you should talk to your father.

20:52.976 --> 20:54.210
You know, you couldn't be more wrong

20:54.212 --> 20:56.445
about my mom.

20:56.447 --> 20:59.515
Money never mattered to her at all.

20:59.517 --> 21:03.019
She only cared about her family.

21:03.021 --> 21:04.787
You never knew her.

21:04.789 --> 21:06.455
You don't even know your own son.

21:06.457 --> 21:10.993
And now you're never
gonna know your grandsons.

21:10.995 --> 21:12.461
Which sucks for you,

21:12.463 --> 21:15.197
'cause we happen to be pretty amazing.

21:29.930 --> 21:32.065
Do you understand that I was
just trying to help a friend,

21:32.067 --> 21:33.666
and yet he takes it as an opportunity

21:33.668 --> 21:36.202
to call me a <i>disappointment?</i>

21:36.204 --> 21:37.604
He's the one who was wrong here.

21:37.606 --> 21:38.938
I understand I took a few shortcuts.

21:38.940 --> 21:40.607
- Fine.
- Pop, look.

21:40.609 --> 21:42.208
You walked away
from the king of all shortcuts.

21:42.210 --> 21:43.643
You walked away from his money.

21:43.645 --> 21:44.878
And we're really proud of that.

21:44.880 --> 21:47.380
And surprised. Mostly proud, though.

21:47.382 --> 21:50.250
You know that I did this for your mother.

21:50.252 --> 21:52.218
That was the easiest decision I ever made

21:52.220 --> 21:53.253
in my whole life.

21:53.255 --> 21:54.254
Dad, listen.

21:54.256 --> 21:56.122
No, I have to go.

21:56.124 --> 21:57.457
Okay, believe me, I get why you want to.

21:57.459 --> 21:58.625
But your curfew.

21:58.627 --> 21:59.726
He can't stay with this guy.

21:59.728 --> 22:00.960
One more night here.

22:00.962 --> 22:03.129
One more night here. Come on, dad.

22:03.131 --> 22:04.230
Eye on the prize.

22:04.232 --> 22:07.100
Parole? Freedom?

22:07.102 --> 22:08.801
Okay, look.

22:08.803 --> 22:09.836
I have to cool down.

22:09.838 --> 22:10.904
Okay.

22:10.906 --> 22:12.071
But can we please just make sure

22:12.073 --> 22:13.540
that Shaw is all right?

22:13.542 --> 22:15.942
Yes, yes, okay. Here's the plan.

22:15.944 --> 22:17.210
- Yeah, what's the plan?
- What's the plan?

22:17.212 --> 22:18.811
We'll pick up the stuff we need,

22:18.813 --> 22:20.146
get Shaw set up at his place.

22:20.148 --> 22:21.848
- Mm-hmm.
- I'll stay with him tonight.

22:21.850 --> 22:23.283
Evan can bring you back here.

22:23.285 --> 22:24.517
Fine, and on the way back,

22:24.519 --> 22:26.019
we will pick up
the toilet paper and the eggs.

22:26.021 --> 22:27.320
- The what now?
- Just trust me.

22:27.322 --> 22:29.355
A little vandalism can be very cathartic.

22:29.357 --> 22:30.390
Ev...! All right, fine.

22:30.392 --> 22:33.159
Eye on the prize.

22:33.161 --> 22:34.127
Thank you.

22:34.129 --> 22:37.130
Oof, he makes me crazy.

22:46.840 --> 22:48.908
Hey.

22:48.910 --> 22:50.310
Who sent those?

22:50.312 --> 22:51.444
Hank.

22:51.446 --> 22:54.080
Wow.

22:54.082 --> 22:56.316
He really went all-out.

22:56.318 --> 23:00.053
These plus three phone calls to me,

23:00.055 --> 23:01.554
one to my doctor,

23:01.556 --> 23:03.289
and how many to you?

23:03.291 --> 23:06.759
I just got another message, actually.

23:06.761 --> 23:09.629
I haven't talked to him
since the radiologist found...

23:09.631 --> 23:12.832
I know. The blush.

23:12.834 --> 23:14.834
Such a pretty word for a bleeding brain.

23:14.836 --> 23:16.936
Even if there is
an intracerebral hemorrhage,

23:16.938 --> 23:18.171
it is tiny.

23:18.173 --> 23:21.007
And not all bleeds require surgery.

23:21.009 --> 23:22.275
Mm.

23:22.277 --> 23:24.444
So there's really no reason
to bother Hank

23:24.446 --> 23:25.645
with this now.

23:25.647 --> 23:27.146
You don't want me to tell him?

23:27.148 --> 23:28.915
If it turns out to be something,

23:28.917 --> 23:30.016
I'll tell him myself.

23:30.018 --> 23:32.285
But for now,

23:32.287 --> 23:34.921
I just need to stop thinking
about blushes

23:34.923 --> 23:37.190
and accidents.

23:37.192 --> 23:39.993
I know what will cheer me up.

23:39.995 --> 23:41.661
Field trip.

23:41.663 --> 23:44.197
Not a good idea, Jill.

23:44.199 --> 23:47.400
Short field trip?

23:47.402 --> 23:49.435
Divya, please?

23:49.437 --> 23:50.903
Just to the NICU.

23:50.905 --> 23:52.905
I really want to check on Marisa

23:52.907 --> 23:54.474
and see how the baby's doing.

23:54.476 --> 23:56.943
Very short field trip.

23:56.945 --> 24:00.847
Okay.

24:00.849 --> 24:02.548
Hey, dad, can you pass me

24:02.550 --> 24:06.252
the bag marked "E.D.T.A."?

24:06.254 --> 24:08.388
What does that stand for?

24:08.390 --> 24:11.457
Ethylenediamenetetracydic acid.

24:11.459 --> 24:13.559
And he needs all of this for chelation?

24:13.561 --> 24:15.328
What he really needs is a hospital.

24:15.330 --> 24:18.598
I've got a virtual hospital right here,

24:18.600 --> 24:20.600
with my own doctor staying
in my guest house.

24:20.602 --> 24:22.669
A doctor who's leaving tomorrow.

24:22.671 --> 24:24.704
Well, still couldn't stay in that hospital.

24:24.706 --> 24:27.974
Started to feel like prison
all over again.

24:27.976 --> 24:30.109
Nah, you're just anxious
about seeing Gina.

24:30.111 --> 24:32.512
No. That's not gonna happen.

24:32.514 --> 24:34.480
Shaw, like Hank said,

24:34.482 --> 24:36.182
these treatments don't take forever.

24:36.184 --> 24:38.284
She's better off without me.

24:38.286 --> 24:41.020
That bright light of faith

24:41.022 --> 24:43.356
or whatever I thought I saw,

24:43.358 --> 24:45.391
I was just sick.

24:45.393 --> 24:46.759
I can't get back into her life

24:46.761 --> 24:48.761
as the same old me.

24:48.763 --> 24:49.996
That is not what changed you.

24:49.998 --> 24:51.631
You changed yourself.

24:51.633 --> 24:53.466
Will you just back off, Eddie?

24:53.468 --> 24:54.701
- I'm just trying to...
- Dad, dad, look.

24:54.703 --> 24:56.436
This may be the lead talking.

24:56.438 --> 24:58.271
E.D.T.A. can initially redistribute lead

24:58.273 --> 24:59.439
into the brain,

24:59.441 --> 25:01.207
causing mental status to get worse

25:01.209 --> 25:02.241
before it gets better.

25:02.243 --> 25:03.710
Hmm.

25:03.712 --> 25:05.111
All right, so you're not being
yourself right now.

25:05.113 --> 25:06.179
But tomorrow...

25:06.181 --> 25:07.413
Will you stop acting like my father?

25:07.415 --> 25:10.416
You don't even know me.

25:10.418 --> 25:12.585
Well, I know you're being a coward.

25:12.587 --> 25:14.987
I know you're scared about facing Gina.

25:14.989 --> 25:16.122
You wanna know how?

25:16.124 --> 25:17.924
Because I made all the same mistakes.

25:17.926 --> 25:20.359
I hid from my boys 'cause I didn't know

25:20.361 --> 25:21.794
if I could make it right.

25:21.796 --> 25:26.299
I didn't even try to make it right.

25:26.301 --> 25:27.934
I was selfish, Hank.

25:27.936 --> 25:30.737
I could not watch her die.

25:30.739 --> 25:33.239
I couldn't make her better.

25:33.241 --> 25:35.975
And... and I couldn't make it
okay for my boys,

25:35.977 --> 25:37.543
so I ran away.

25:37.545 --> 25:42.081
It didn't even dawn on me
that you would forgive me.

25:42.083 --> 25:44.250
God knows I won't forgive myself,

25:44.252 --> 25:47.487
but let me tell you, it was worth trying.

26:02.836 --> 26:05.404
Hi.

26:05.406 --> 26:06.606
Hi.

26:06.608 --> 26:08.775
So when can he leave the NICU?

26:08.777 --> 26:12.178
In 24 hours. It's just as a precaution.

26:12.180 --> 26:14.847
But he's had no
subsequent episodes, so...

26:14.849 --> 26:16.516
And Boris would know.

26:16.518 --> 26:20.486
He's either been in there
or glued to this window.

26:20.488 --> 26:23.723
Listen, Marisa...

26:23.725 --> 26:25.291
about the cord blood,

26:25.293 --> 26:26.559
I am so sorry...

26:26.561 --> 26:27.760
No, no, no, no, no. No.

26:27.762 --> 26:28.995
There's nothing to apologize for.

26:28.997 --> 26:30.229
It was an accident.

26:30.231 --> 26:31.597
Besides, I won't give up

26:31.599 --> 26:33.366
on finding a way to help my son.

26:33.368 --> 26:35.468
Or his father.

26:38.438 --> 26:39.872
I'm going to go back in there.

26:39.874 --> 26:41.507
Would either of you like
to hold him again?

26:41.509 --> 26:43.609
I would love to.

26:52.319 --> 26:55.888
Miss Casey, I'm... I'm sorry.

26:55.890 --> 26:58.057
People are usually
in very good hands with Natan.

26:58.059 --> 27:01.093
Sometimes accidents just happen.

27:01.095 --> 27:05.298
Yes.

27:05.300 --> 27:07.967
The police suggested
it may have been a drunk driver?

27:07.969 --> 27:09.502
Yeah.

27:09.504 --> 27:11.037
I wish I could have told them something,

27:11.039 --> 27:12.738
but I can't remember.

27:12.740 --> 27:17.476
I've been trying, but...

27:17.478 --> 27:19.078
You know...

27:19.080 --> 27:23.349
at first, I thought
I remembered flashlights

27:23.351 --> 27:25.251
and cigarette smoke,

27:25.253 --> 27:29.388
but that couldn't be right.

27:29.390 --> 27:31.257
I don't know. I just...

27:31.259 --> 27:35.995
If I could just remember.

27:35.997 --> 27:38.431
Your turn.

27:38.433 --> 27:40.466
Listen, Boris,

27:40.468 --> 27:43.369
if I remember anything else,
I'll let you know,

27:43.371 --> 27:46.806
and I'll make sure
we're taking good care of Natan.

27:46.808 --> 27:48.741
Thank you.

27:48.743 --> 27:50.810
Okay.

28:02.155 --> 28:06.692
That's Gina. My little girl.

28:06.694 --> 28:08.961
She's adorable.

28:08.963 --> 28:10.529
How old?

28:10.531 --> 28:13.165
Almost six.

28:13.167 --> 28:16.669
Jen, her mom, sent this to me.

28:16.671 --> 28:19.472
I almost didn't recognize her,

28:19.474 --> 28:21.040
it'd been so long.

28:21.042 --> 28:23.142
Mm.

28:23.144 --> 28:24.810
You and Eddie have been estranged

28:24.812 --> 28:26.112
for a long time, right?

28:26.114 --> 28:27.513
Too long.

28:27.515 --> 28:28.848
But you and your brother

28:28.850 --> 28:30.449
turned out pretty well anyway, huh?

28:30.451 --> 28:34.020
Yeah. Still sucked
growing up without a father.

28:34.022 --> 28:35.922
Well, he was a screw-up.

28:35.924 --> 28:38.291
He said so himself.

28:38.293 --> 28:40.459
How do you know you weren't
better off without him?

28:40.461 --> 28:44.163
For a long time, I thought I was.

28:44.165 --> 28:45.631
But I still missed him.

28:45.633 --> 28:48.100
And I missed out.

28:48.102 --> 28:50.269
You ever forgive him?

28:50.271 --> 28:53.139
I did.

28:53.141 --> 28:55.374
But until tonight,

28:55.376 --> 28:57.710
I didn't know why.

29:05.153 --> 29:06.686
Shaw?

29:06.688 --> 29:10.389
Shaw?

29:10.391 --> 29:12.058
Shaw.

29:12.060 --> 29:14.860
Shaw? Shaw?

29:18.632 --> 29:21.000
Hi, daddy.

29:21.002 --> 29:23.302
Shaw. Shaw!

29:29.722 --> 29:33.391
You're having an allergic
reaction to the chelation.

29:45.070 --> 29:47.405
Um, 2406 Ocean Avenue.

29:47.407 --> 29:50.508
I have an adult male
going into anaphylactic shock.

29:50.510 --> 29:52.376
Yes, I did that. I'm a doctor.

29:52.378 --> 29:54.212
He has rapidly evolving angioedema,

29:54.214 --> 29:55.947
tachycardia, and hypoxia.

29:55.949 --> 29:58.649
Just gave 0.03 mills of epi sub-q.

29:58.651 --> 30:01.219
Already have a line in,
I'm pushing diphenhydramine.

30:01.221 --> 30:03.988
Okay. We're out back.

30:07.292 --> 30:09.126
Okay. The epinephrine'll work fast.

30:09.128 --> 30:11.395
Just hang in there, Shaw.

30:11.397 --> 30:13.564
Just hang in there, Shaw. Hang in there.

30:13.566 --> 30:17.935
Just stay with me, Shaw. Stay with me.

30:22.474 --> 30:25.743
Come here.

30:25.745 --> 30:27.211
All right. That's it.

30:27.213 --> 30:29.080
Just take slow, deep breaths.

30:29.082 --> 30:31.215
Slow, deep breaths.

30:33.952 --> 30:35.586
That's it.

30:35.588 --> 30:36.821
Shaw?

30:37.824 --> 30:41.058
Shaw. Do you know who I am?

30:41.060 --> 30:44.629
Yeah.

30:47.233 --> 30:50.201
You're the guy who saved my life.

30:50.203 --> 30:52.303
Twice.

30:52.305 --> 30:55.172
You got one up on your father.

30:55.174 --> 30:57.575
Yeah.

30:57.577 --> 30:59.744
We're a competitive family.

31:16.561 --> 31:18.429
Jill?

31:18.431 --> 31:20.164
You can open your eyes now.

31:20.166 --> 31:21.565
In a minute.

31:21.567 --> 31:23.668
We have the radiologist standing by

31:23.670 --> 31:25.970
to read the images immediately.

31:25.972 --> 31:28.572
- Thanks, Leslie.
- Of course.

31:28.574 --> 31:31.275
And the pictures
will come back in seconds.

31:31.277 --> 31:33.544
Oh, I know. I just paid an arm and a leg

31:33.546 --> 31:35.880
upgrading this thing.

31:38.451 --> 31:39.650
Is that her with the results?

31:39.652 --> 31:41.452
Jill, open your eyes.

31:41.454 --> 31:45.222
I can't. I'll be able
to read the look on your face.

31:45.224 --> 31:47.992
Yeah. I think you will.

31:52.397 --> 31:57.401
Nothing?

31:57.403 --> 31:58.402
Nothing?

31:58.404 --> 32:00.604
No intracerebral hemorrhage.

32:00.606 --> 32:02.840
The blush must have been
a motion or a ring artifact.

32:02.842 --> 32:05.042
O... okay.

32:05.044 --> 32:06.944
I can't talk about the blush anymore.

32:06.946 --> 32:08.679
- Right.
- Thank you.

32:08.681 --> 32:10.581
You're welcome.

32:14.886 --> 32:17.955
- So.
- So.

32:17.957 --> 32:21.592
Can I please go home now?

32:21.594 --> 32:23.361
I believe the doctor
will want to release you

32:23.363 --> 32:24.528
into someone's care.

32:24.530 --> 32:25.763
You know, just to monitor you

32:25.765 --> 32:28.499
for headaches, nausea, drowsiness.

32:28.501 --> 32:29.567
Family member, perhaps.

32:29.569 --> 32:31.035
Hmm.

32:31.037 --> 32:32.436
Staying with my family

32:32.438 --> 32:36.407
would guarantee all of those symptoms.

32:36.409 --> 32:39.243
Well, I suppose
under these circumstances,

32:39.245 --> 32:41.879
a medical professional would be best.

32:41.881 --> 32:43.681
And I happen to be
staying in a guest house

32:43.683 --> 32:45.750
with a doctor's office built right in.

32:57.896 --> 32:59.597
What?

32:59.599 --> 33:00.664
How much sleep have you had

33:00.666 --> 33:01.999
since we got to Florida?

33:02.001 --> 33:03.634
Oh. This may look like a vacation,

33:03.636 --> 33:04.735
but it doesn't feel like one.

33:04.737 --> 33:07.004
I know. How's Shaw?

33:07.006 --> 33:08.439
I talked to his doctor at the hospital.

33:08.441 --> 33:09.707
- He's doing great.
- Good.

33:09.709 --> 33:11.275
And dad called. He's going over there.

33:11.277 --> 33:13.377
He said we should pick him up
on the way to the hearing.

33:13.379 --> 33:17.615
Speaking of the hearing...

33:17.617 --> 33:20.451
you're not gonna ask about
my carefully-chosen wardrobe?

33:20.453 --> 33:21.986
Hadn't planned on it.

33:21.988 --> 33:23.087
Paige picked it out for me.

33:23.089 --> 33:24.188
According to her research,

33:24.190 --> 33:26.190
blue is associated with honesty,

33:26.192 --> 33:29.326
and yellow, well, that's just good luck.

33:29.328 --> 33:31.662
Well, I'm sure Paige's
color scheme is all we need.

33:31.664 --> 33:32.963
You really want to pick this fight?

33:32.965 --> 33:34.198
- No, I...
- Right now?

33:34.200 --> 33:35.599
- No.
- You really want to go there?

33:35.601 --> 33:38.436
No. We should be worrying
about dad's hearing.

33:38.438 --> 33:39.870
I agree.

33:39.872 --> 33:41.405
When I dropped dad off last night,

33:41.407 --> 33:42.606
Ted was already asleep,

33:42.608 --> 33:44.475
so I doubt there was any reconciling.

33:44.477 --> 33:45.910
Yeah, it didn't sound like

33:45.912 --> 33:47.745
there was any reconciling
this morning either.

33:47.747 --> 33:49.380
So we came all the way to Florida

33:49.382 --> 33:51.849
just to put the final nail in the coffin

33:51.851 --> 33:53.384
of dad's relationship with his father,

33:53.386 --> 33:55.719
basically ensuring that dad's
going back to jail tomorrow.

33:55.721 --> 33:57.955
Maybe you should be wearing
less blue and more yellow.

34:16.408 --> 34:17.475
Hello.

34:17.476 --> 34:20.377
- Is that him?
- Yes.

34:20.379 --> 34:23.080
Look who's come to see you.

34:23.081 --> 34:25.916
Gina?

34:25.918 --> 34:27.650
Jenny?

34:39.630 --> 34:41.465
Hi, daddy.

34:43.768 --> 34:45.870
Your friend Eddie said you were sick.

34:45.871 --> 34:48.873
Yes, but look how much better
he looks now.

34:48.875 --> 34:51.609
And, yes, I meddled,
and I'm acting like your father,

34:51.610 --> 34:54.879
and I don't even know you, and
all the other things you said.

34:54.880 --> 34:58.449
But I had to call them.

34:58.451 --> 35:02.186
Hey. Can you give your daddy a hug?

35:02.188 --> 35:04.722
Huh?

35:10.061 --> 35:13.063
You don't take no for an answer, do you?

35:13.065 --> 35:16.100
Not anymore. You?

35:16.102 --> 35:18.335
Not anymore.

35:31.284 --> 35:33.551
You okay?

35:37.822 --> 35:39.657
Yeah.

35:39.659 --> 35:42.359
I'm fine.

35:42.361 --> 35:44.528
Yeah, it's just a nightmare.

37:18.990 --> 37:20.457
This is gonna be fine, right?

37:20.459 --> 37:21.959
Of course it is.

37:21.961 --> 37:23.627
I am so sorry.

37:23.629 --> 37:25.229
Why are you sorry?

37:25.231 --> 37:27.865
Because I thought introducing
you to your grandfather

37:27.867 --> 37:29.633
was a good idea. I just wanted to...

37:29.635 --> 37:32.169
Put this family back together. I know.

37:32.171 --> 37:34.438
Dad, you... we got all the family we need.

37:34.440 --> 37:37.408
Hey. It's almost Eddie's turn.

37:37.410 --> 37:39.243
- You must be Eddie.
- I am.

37:39.245 --> 37:40.844
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

37:40.846 --> 37:42.479
- Read so much about you.
- Thank you.

37:42.481 --> 37:44.181
Uh, wait. Where's the sponsor?

37:44.183 --> 37:45.349
He's a no-show.

37:45.351 --> 37:46.650
How bad is that?

37:46.652 --> 37:48.419
Uh, definitely could be better,

37:48.421 --> 37:51.221
but won't be my first tap dance.

37:51.223 --> 37:52.823
Let's go.

37:52.825 --> 37:55.759
Look, we faced this before together,

37:55.761 --> 37:56.927
so we can do this again.

37:56.929 --> 37:57.895
Yes, we can.

37:57.897 --> 37:59.430
Okay. My boys.

37:59.432 --> 38:01.498
Yeah. 'Cause it went so well
the last time.

38:01.500 --> 38:03.167
Yeah.

38:07.440 --> 38:09.973
About time you got here.

38:09.975 --> 38:13.410
Edward, I swear.

38:13.412 --> 38:17.715
When are you going to learn
to be punctual?

38:17.717 --> 38:19.883
You're here.

38:19.885 --> 38:22.186
Nothing gets by you.

38:28.560 --> 38:32.696
Thank you.

38:32.698 --> 38:35.199
I bet if I knew more
about this, I'd be riveted,

38:35.201 --> 38:37.501
but we should go in now.

38:44.809 --> 38:46.944
So what changed your mind?

38:46.946 --> 38:49.079
You did.

39:03.128 --> 39:05.296
No more ankle bracelet.

39:05.298 --> 39:07.031
No more prison fights.

39:07.033 --> 39:08.499
No more prison food.

39:08.501 --> 39:09.900
Let's say hello to freedom.

39:09.902 --> 39:11.669
Hello, freedom.

39:11.671 --> 39:13.204
Congratulations, pop.

39:13.206 --> 39:15.139
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

39:15.141 --> 39:18.409
I knew I'd find it in there somewhere.

39:18.411 --> 39:21.045
Ah. The Roth family album.

39:21.047 --> 39:24.882
Oh, my God.

39:24.884 --> 39:28.586
No way.

39:28.588 --> 39:29.653
That one on the right,

39:29.655 --> 39:30.988
that's your great Uncle Leon.

39:30.990 --> 39:32.623
No, that's aunt Roberta.

39:34.093 --> 39:35.459
Oh, oh. Well, then the other guy

39:35.461 --> 39:36.460
is your great Uncle Leon.

39:36.462 --> 39:37.461
Oh. Okay.

39:37.463 --> 39:38.762
He was a doctor in the war.

39:38.764 --> 39:39.763
He was a doctor.

39:39.765 --> 39:43.400
That's cool.

39:43.402 --> 39:46.203
That's your great grandfather, my father.

39:46.205 --> 39:48.305
He was a businessman
like you and me, Evan.

39:48.307 --> 39:50.274
He had a string of roadside diners

39:50.276 --> 39:51.542
in northern Jersey.

39:51.544 --> 39:54.745
Wow.

39:54.747 --> 39:55.980
Ah.

39:55.982 --> 39:57.848
Hey.

39:57.850 --> 39:59.383
You put me in here?

39:59.385 --> 40:00.651
You're family, aren't you?

40:00.653 --> 40:02.920
As a matter of fact, keep it.

40:02.922 --> 40:05.256
You probably don't have
a lot of photos of the Roths.

40:05.258 --> 40:08.425
None, actually. Thank you.

40:08.427 --> 40:10.060
Yeah, thank you.

40:10.062 --> 40:11.829
Not just for the album either, you know.

40:11.831 --> 40:14.331
Now we can take our dad
back with us to the Hamptons.

40:14.333 --> 40:15.900
You know, if it's all right with him,

40:15.902 --> 40:17.735
I'd like to stay a little while longer.

40:19.204 --> 40:20.804
Okay. Why?

40:20.806 --> 40:22.506
Well, you know, it took awhile

40:22.508 --> 40:24.708
to repair the stuff with you guys,

40:24.710 --> 40:28.312
and, uh, I think I need
to put some time in here too.

40:30.882 --> 40:32.516
Are you cool with that, Ted?

40:32.518 --> 40:35.586
I suppose I can put up with him.

40:35.588 --> 40:37.221
Oh.

40:37.223 --> 40:38.622
And call me grandpa.

40:38.624 --> 40:40.925
"Grandpa" sounds pretty good.

40:47.766 --> 40:51.869
So... about the Paige situation...

40:51.871 --> 40:54.572
Right. We were gonna revisit that.

40:54.574 --> 40:56.607
Yeah. So look, Henry.

40:56.609 --> 40:59.176
I don't need your approval

40:59.178 --> 41:02.913
or your permission to propose
to the girl that I love.

41:02.915 --> 41:04.048
Furthermore...

41:04.050 --> 41:06.050
You're absolutely right.

41:06.052 --> 41:07.484
And I'm sorry.

41:07.486 --> 41:08.886
I'm sorry for how I reacted

41:08.888 --> 41:11.422
when you asked for mom's ring.

41:11.424 --> 41:13.791
What?

41:13.793 --> 41:15.893
Look, I've always been
the more cautious one.

41:15.895 --> 41:18.228
I mean, you... you jump in with both feet,

41:18.230 --> 41:21.799
and I'm more one toe at a time.

41:21.801 --> 41:24.001
You know, I like to know
as much as possible,

41:24.003 --> 41:27.137
and then think about it,
and then make a decision.

41:27.139 --> 41:29.573
I know everything
I need to know about Paige.

41:29.575 --> 41:31.075
Yeah. Yeah.

41:31.077 --> 41:33.043
Look, I should have been
more supportive, you know.

41:33.045 --> 41:35.879
These are the kinds of things
that can escalate into...

41:35.881 --> 41:37.748
I... I don't want to wake up in 40 years

41:37.750 --> 41:39.950
and not remember the last time
I spoke to my little brother.

41:39.952 --> 41:41.819
That would never happen to us.

41:41.821 --> 41:43.487
I know. I know.

41:43.489 --> 41:44.788
Because as soon as we get home,

41:44.790 --> 41:47.091
I'm going straight
to the safe deposit box

41:47.093 --> 41:51.562
and getting mom's ring
so you can propose to Paige.

41:51.564 --> 41:53.797
Want to try for an awkward car hug?

41:53.799 --> 41:54.832
We'll hug when we get out.

41:54.834 --> 41:55.799
- Okay, great.
- Okay.

41:55.801 --> 41:57.434
On to more important matters,

41:57.436 --> 42:00.804
how soon is too soon
to plan for a bachelor party?

42:00.806 --> 42:02.272
You should probably wait

42:02.274 --> 42:03.941
until you've made
some plans for the wedding.

42:03.943 --> 42:05.309
I... I plan on there being a wedding.

42:05.311 --> 42:07.044
I... that's not enough?

42:07.046 --> 42:08.312
Well, I don't know.

42:08.314 --> 42:09.847
You might want to wait
until you get a yes.

42:09.849 --> 42:10.914
What do you mean get a yes?

42:10.916 --> 42:12.049
Get a yes from who?

42:12.051 --> 42:13.617
Oh...
