WEBVTT

00:08.000 --> 00:09.200
No, no , don't answer.

00:09.300 --> 00:11.500
Oh, it's probably...
Probably, this is for my book.

00:13.800 --> 00:15.300
Shhh. Let's pretend it's the ocean.

00:18.500 --> 00:19.300
See that.

00:19.600 --> 00:20.700
God, love sex.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.300
Keep calling.

00:28.400 --> 00:31.300
- I thought you hated publicity.
- Oh, it's a part of my contract.

00:31.800 --> 00:34.400
The book is getting a lot of attention.
Just trying to do my job.

00:37.401 --> 00:38.299
Hello.

00:39.500 --> 00:40.400
Hi, Helen.

00:40.900 --> 00:42.600
Of course she did look out on the view.
I think Rosy had a little thing for it.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.500
That seems like a lot...

00:49.200 --> 00:52.400
Well, it's two interviews,
and a book-signing in one day...

00:53.700 --> 00:55.500
I don't know about tuesday.

00:59.900 --> 01:02.400
Just hum... send the schedule

01:02.500 --> 01:04.800
to the *** okay.

01:05.099 --> 01:06.500
I'll see you, I'm leaving right now.

01:10.100 --> 01:13.600
- Now this is something you don't *
look at the scene at the publishing house.
- Oh, dear Lord.

01:18.300 --> 01:19.100
You smell that ? Yeah.

01:22.101 --> 01:22.999
Sorry I'm late.

01:23.000 --> 01:23.800
Oh, thank god. Think...

01:25.200 --> 01:28.200
You know, dear, your book
is on the bestseller's list.

01:28.300 --> 01:30.100
You don't have to work in
this place anymore.

01:30.200 --> 01:32.500
This is my real love, Helen.

01:32.800 --> 01:35.200
I know a therapist 
who could really help you.

01:35.800 --> 01:37.300
OK.

01:37.700 --> 01:40.000
The reading and the book-signing
are this wednesday night.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.300
* is * for tranportation.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.500
He's... A car will pick you up
here at the lab, Dr Bennet.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.300
And then, there's the radio interview,
next tuesday.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.900
Now that's an early one, so just tell Hank
what would you like for breakfast.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.800
That's not necessary.

01:49.900 --> 01:51.600
No, honey, don't worry about that,
that's what Hank is for.

01:51.700 --> 01:52.500
Right, Hank ?

01:52.900 --> 01:56.300
Sure, um, I wanted to tell you
Dr. Bennett, I'm a huge...

01:56.500 --> 01:58.000
fan, I thought this book is even better...

01:58.100 --> 02:00.000
You know, as far as you have
photo shoot is concerned...

02:00.100 --> 02:02.400
OK, Bones. We gotta go.
They found a floater in the marina.

02:02.500 --> 02:06.200
Oh, my partner, Seeley Booth,
this is the publicist for my book.

02:06.300 --> 02:07.800
Helen Laskow, and her assistant, Hank.

02:07.900 --> 02:08.699
Hello.

02:09.100 --> 02:11.200
Now I see what temper *
those dirty little

02:11.300 --> 02:12.300
scenes in her book.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.400
- That's not me. Not me. No.
- It's not hum.

02:15.100 --> 02:18.300
Right, you must let me get you
that therapist number, dear.

02:18.400 --> 02:19.900
No, seriously, she's got someone.

02:20.100 --> 02:21.700
- Booth.
- No, it's nothing to be ashamed of.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.200
I mean, he's kind of short.

02:23.300 --> 02:26.500
- Short.
- He's not short. Just because 
he's not * tall like you are...

02:26.700 --> 02:29.000
Didn't you say that you had
remains for me to examine ?

02:29.200 --> 02:30.300
Oh, right. Come on, let's go.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.800
Well, thanks for the schedule, Ellen.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:42.000 --> 02:44.800
So, is it just me, or is this,
you know, kind of weird ?

02:44.900 --> 02:45.700
What ?

02:45.800 --> 02:48.500
Well, in your new book, they found
a body at a marina, right ?

02:48.600 --> 02:50.300
- You read my book ?
- Of course.

02:50.800 --> 02:51.900
Anyhow, guy docking the boats

02:52.000 --> 02:53.600
saw something floating in the water.

02:53.700 --> 02:54.700
Thought it was a dead fish,

02:54.800 --> 02:56.600
and it ended up being
a decomposed hand.

02:56.700 --> 02:58.600
The dive crew just located
the rest of the body.

02:58.700 --> 03:00.500
I didn't think you'd have
time to read my book.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.200
You've time to write it,
I have time to read it.

03:02.300 --> 03:04.600
Besides, not like I can
avoid the damn thing.

03:04.700 --> 03:05.800
Your book is everywhere.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.000
Okay, bring it up.

03:09.200 --> 03:10.700
Booth, look.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.400
Wait... body on the anchor ?

03:14.600 --> 03:16.000
Yeah, tied to the chain.

03:16.700 --> 03:18.400
Body's not tied with a rope.

03:19.000 --> 03:19.900
Divers said they used...

03:20.000 --> 03:20.900
Red tape.

03:24.800 --> 03:25.800
How'd you know ?

03:27.600 --> 03:29.400
Because that's how I wrote it.

04:08.700 --> 04:10.900
Victim was male, mid-40s.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.800
Estimated time of death
is five days ago.

04:14.100 --> 04:15.400
Only five days ?

04:15.500 --> 04:17.399
This is an extreme rate of decomp.

04:17.500 --> 04:19.800
Blue crab season.
They'll feed on anything,

04:19.899 --> 04:21.000
dead or alive.

04:21.100 --> 04:23.800
Vegetation, fish, flesh...

04:23.900 --> 04:25.800
Ugh, opportunistic little bastards.

04:25.900 --> 04:28.900
Elliptical wound on the frontal
bone with the reverse beveling.

04:29.400 --> 04:30.400
He was shot.

04:30.500 --> 04:31.300
Is there a bullet ?

04:31.400 --> 04:34.200
No. Irregular exit wound
on the occipital.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.500
Looks like a through and through.

04:36.600 --> 04:40.400
Dr. Brennan, exactly how similar
is this situation to your book ?

04:40.500 --> 04:42.800
The victims in my book are bound

04:42.900 --> 04:44.200
and gagged with red tape,

04:44.300 --> 04:47.000
shot and then fed to various animals.

04:47.900 --> 04:48.700
Cheery.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.100
I loved the symbolism of the red tape.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.500
Perfect way to dispose of bureaucrats.

04:53.900 --> 04:54.800
Thank you.

04:55.300 --> 04:57.400
The first body in the book
is tied to an anchor

04:57.500 --> 04:59.200
and dropped in the water at a marina.

04:59.300 --> 05:01.000
I'd prefer not to jump to conclusions.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.200
I don't think it requires a jump.

05:03.600 --> 05:06.100
Just a little hop. A little teeny...

05:06.200 --> 05:10.000
In this lab, we are concerned
with science, not fiction.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.600
This is a sketch based on tissue
markers on the skull.

05:19.700 --> 05:21.700
PCB's and lead we found in the collagen

05:21.800 --> 05:24.600
mean the victim's from the north
end of the Chesapeake,

05:25.100 --> 05:26.800
probably outside Annapolis.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.000
Did you have to whisper that in my ear ?

05:30.100 --> 05:31.300
It seemed right.

05:31.500 --> 05:34.600
Check the image against
DMV photos from Maryland.

05:38.300 --> 05:39.200
Bones...

05:40.800 --> 05:41.900
How are you holding up ?

05:42.100 --> 05:43.300
What do you mean ? Fine.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.600
You know, something like this,

05:44.700 --> 05:46.400
it's understandable if you're upset.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.200
It's probably a coincidence.

05:48.300 --> 05:49.800
Hey, how's it going ?

05:50.400 --> 05:51.900
What-what are you doing here ?

05:52.000 --> 05:52.800
Uh, yeah.

05:52.900 --> 05:55.100
Well, I heard we have a copycat
killer using your book...

05:55.200 --> 05:56.500
That hasn't been established.

05:56.600 --> 05:57.700
Yeah, I've got it covered here, Sully.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.700
Two hands are better
than one, Booth.

06:00.400 --> 06:03.200
Well, last time I looked,
I have two hands, see ? Thanks.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.700
Testosterone spill on aisle four.

06:06.300 --> 06:08.200
We don't know that
my book is the cause.

06:08.300 --> 06:10.400
So far what we do know is...
Someone died

06:10.500 --> 06:12.500
exactly the way described
in your book.

06:13.600 --> 06:15.300
Do you keep any of
your old fan mail ?

06:15.700 --> 06:16.800
No. I don't even read it.

06:16.900 --> 06:18.700
The publicist deals with all that.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.300
Yeah, I mean,
why are you asking, Sully ?

06:20.400 --> 06:21.700
I'm in charge of this investigation.

06:21.800 --> 06:24.700
Well, Booth, I was a profiler
for two years.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.000
I have a lot of experience
with these cases.

06:27.100 --> 06:29.400
This could be someone showing
what a big fan he is,

06:29.500 --> 06:32.100
or someone rying to get
close to her, too close.

06:32.200 --> 06:33.600
I don't need to be protected.

06:33.700 --> 06:34.800
Yes, you do.

06:35.700 --> 06:37.600
Look, you still call the shots.

06:37.700 --> 06:39.700
I just think I'd be an
asset to the team.

06:42.100 --> 06:46.100
Okay, fine. We send all the fan
mail to Sully in his office.

06:46.400 --> 06:47.800
Fine, I'll call Ellen.

06:47.900 --> 06:49.600
We could be dealing with
a real sicko here.

06:49.700 --> 06:50.800
Jim Lopata.

06:52.300 --> 06:53.400
Not the sicko.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.100
The sicko's victim.

06:57.700 --> 07:00.400
43, married, no kids.

07:00.500 --> 07:03.500
From Glen Burnie
outside of Annapolis.

07:04.500 --> 07:06.100
So your husband never called you ?

07:06.200 --> 07:07.400
I thought, uh...

07:08.400 --> 07:10.600
he was supposed to be
on a business trip.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.300
And you hadn't seen him
since last Tuesday ?

07:15.600 --> 07:17.100
Oh, no, his trips...

07:18.600 --> 07:19.900
he works shard.

07:20.300 --> 07:22.500
Morning till night,
driving hundreds of miles.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.800
Greg, did you and your
sister's husband get along ?

07:27.300 --> 07:28.200
Well enough.

07:29.300 --> 07:30.300
Mm.

07:30.500 --> 07:34.200
Any idea if... he had any enemies ?

07:35.700 --> 07:37.100
Wouldn't come as a shock.

07:38.200 --> 07:39.400
Jim liked to drink.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.600
He could turn into
a real jerk sometimes.

07:41.700 --> 07:44.400
- We were working through it.
- Right.

07:44.700 --> 07:46.100
Greg... I'm sorry.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.600
But part of me thinks
you're better off, Connie.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.500
Are you better off, Mrs. Lopata ?

07:51.900 --> 07:53.300
How can you say that ?

07:54.500 --> 07:56.000
My husband's dead.

07:56.900 --> 07:57.800
Of course.

07:58.600 --> 07:59.500
I'm sorry.

08:00.900 --> 08:03.600
It's just... one more thing.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.600
I realize this is gonna
sound a little strange,

08:05.700 --> 08:09.700
but do either of you two read,
uh... mystery novels ?

08:10.900 --> 08:12.500
What the hell's this got
to do with anything ?

08:12.600 --> 08:13.800
Just answer him, Greg.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.100
Greg likes them. Why ?

08:18.100 --> 08:19.700
It's just something I gotta ask.

08:23.700 --> 08:25.800
The tape actually managed
to preserve particular matter

08:25.900 --> 08:28.200
that was present on the
body before it was dumped.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.000
Any hair ? Other goodies
that can give us DNA ?

08:31.100 --> 08:33.200
No, but I did find sand.

08:34.299 --> 08:36.600
Victim was in the ocean,
Hodgins. A lot of sand there.

08:36.700 --> 08:38.600
Yeah, but the sediment
distribution doesn't match.

08:38.700 --> 08:40.100
The sand came from someplace else.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.299
Okay, try to locate the source.

08:43.299 --> 08:44.600
What about the tape itself ?

08:44.900 --> 08:47.000
- Composition ? Brand ?
- Working on it.

08:47.800 --> 08:48.600
Cool.

08:51.200 --> 08:53.100
Do you really plan on
reading Dr. Brennan's book ?

08:53.101 --> 08:53.999
What ?

08:54.000 --> 08:56.600
Of course. I only... I bought it.

08:56.800 --> 08:57.800
You know, it's on a...

08:58.400 --> 09:00.700
pile; I'm waiting... no, I don't.

09:01.601 --> 09:02.499
Please don't tell her.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.500
It's just, after dealing
with murder all day,

09:04.600 --> 09:07.300
I can't bring myself to go home
and read about it for kicks.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.400
So, for kicks you read... ?

09:09.900 --> 09:10.900
Feminist trash.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.700
You know, woman finds her power,

09:12.800 --> 09:14.500
leaves her oppressive husband,

09:15.100 --> 09:17.100
discovers freedom and
fulfillment with an artist

09:17.200 --> 09:19.400
who knows how to cry and
make love like an animal.

09:19.500 --> 09:21.000
So, sex books.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.200
Pretty much, yeah.

09:22.300 --> 09:23.200
Hmm.

09:24.500 --> 09:27.000
Let me know if you find
any organics on that tape.

09:27.100 --> 09:27.900
Yup.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.800
Is the FBI aware of the situation ?

09:34.100 --> 09:35.000
What do you mean ?

09:35.200 --> 09:37.400
Booth and Sully are
both working the case.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.900
I meant the other
murders in your book.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.600
The marina victim is
the first of three.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.100
Please, concentrate
on the remains, Zack.

09:46.300 --> 09:49.100
It's just, the later dump sites
are far less specific.

09:49.200 --> 09:51.300
How could the FBI prevent...

09:51.400 --> 09:52.400
Because we're the good guys, Zack.

09:52.500 --> 09:53.400
Don't you forget that, okay ?

09:53.500 --> 09:55.600
Possible motive for Jim Lopata's murder...

09:57.700 --> 09:59.500
Connie Lopata's medical records ?

10:00.200 --> 10:01.500
Check out the ER visits.

10:02.300 --> 10:03.400
Broken rib,

10:03.500 --> 10:05.100
concussion, severe bruising.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.300
Someone was abusing her.

10:06.400 --> 10:07.400
Her husband.

10:07.500 --> 10:10.700
So, the wife's brother
Greg knew about it

10:10.800 --> 10:12.900
and killed the husband
to protect his sister.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.300
Made it look like a copycat
to cover his tracks.

10:15.700 --> 10:17.300
I got more info on the red tape.

10:17.400 --> 10:20.800
It's a thermosetting silicon
adhesive with glass cloth backing.

10:20.900 --> 10:23.200
Secures materials under
high temperatures.

10:23.300 --> 10:25.600
Mostly used for electrical
and industrial applications.

10:25.700 --> 10:28.100
Is this Greg person an electrician ?

10:28.200 --> 10:29.900
Other works at Reagan National Airport.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
He's a baggage handler.

10:31.100 --> 10:33.700
But glass tape is used
on aircraft, too.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.300
To secure cargo holds.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.500
It didn't take a genius
to figure out he hit her.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.000
You wanted to protect her.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.200
She's my sister.

10:43.800 --> 10:44.800
Of course I did.

10:46.200 --> 10:48.400
I tried to get her to leave
him, but she was so...

10:50.600 --> 10:51.800
I don't know. It was messed up.

10:51.900 --> 10:53.800
So you decided to handle
things your own way.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.300
What, meaning what, I killed him ?

10:56.300 --> 10:57.300
No way.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.400
I'm not saying
I didn't want him dead,

10:59.600 --> 11:00.800
but I never touched him.

11:01.700 --> 11:03.600
Swear on my mother's grave.

11:04.100 --> 11:07.500
Sorry, Greg, but that particular
oath is no longer recognized

11:07.600 --> 11:08.400
in a court of law.

11:08.500 --> 11:09.500
Listen, if you're gonna charge me

11:09.600 --> 11:10.600
with something, do it. If not...

11:10.700 --> 11:11.600
Where you were last Wednesday

11:11.700 --> 11:13.300
when your brother-in-law was killed ?

11:16.800 --> 11:18.000
In the mountains.

11:18.300 --> 11:19.500
I went camping.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.200
I'm assuming you were alone.

11:24.300 --> 11:25.800
If you can find the other people...

11:25.900 --> 11:27.400
Just stay close, all right ?

11:27.500 --> 11:29.200
Don't go anywhere anytime soon.

11:29.300 --> 11:30.300
All right, Greg ?

11:34.300 --> 11:35.300
- Booth.
- Yeah.

11:35.400 --> 11:36.400
Did you see his right hand ?

11:36.500 --> 11:38.500
Sure. Well, not really. Why ?

11:38.600 --> 11:40.800
The third and fourth
phalanges, they're fused together.

11:40.900 --> 11:41.900
Greg has syndactyly.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.900
Syndactyly, yeah, of course.

11:44.000 --> 11:44.800
Is that relevant ?

11:44.900 --> 11:47.600
Well, it could indicate
the presence of other birth defects,

11:47.700 --> 11:48.900
things that might affect
his range of motion.

11:49.000 --> 11:49.600
We should look into that.

11:49.700 --> 11:51.500
Would he be able to shlea gun ?

11:51.501 --> 11:52.399
What ?

11:52.400 --> 11:54.400
If his fingers, you know,
were fused like that,

11:54.500 --> 11:56.100
would he still be able to,
you know, pull a trigger ?

11:56.500 --> 11:57.800
don't see why not.

11:57.900 --> 11:59.400
Okay. That good enough for me.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.800
If it's no ihim, Booth...

12:04.800 --> 12:06.800
There are two other
murders in the book.

12:08.300 --> 12:09.200
I know.

12:10.300 --> 12:11.100
Hank.

12:13.700 --> 12:14.800
What are you doing here ?

12:15.201 --> 12:16.099
Ellen sent me out.

12:16.100 --> 12:17.900
Said you needed all
your old fan mail.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.100
Plus, she needs a half-caf
soy latte every day at 10:00,

12:21.400 --> 12:24.100
a half-caf soy latte with
a dollop of foam

12:24.200 --> 12:25.900
and a sprinkle of chocolate shings

12:26.100 --> 12:27.100
every day...

12:30.800 --> 12:31.800
Um...

12:32.100 --> 12:34.000
I'm looking for an Agent Sullivan.

12:34.100 --> 12:36.000
Oh, yeah, he's down the hall,

12:36.100 --> 12:37.100
in his office.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.000
Booth.

12:40.600 --> 12:41.500
Yeah.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
What's wrong ?

12:46.200 --> 12:48.200
Someone must have broken
in Saturday night.

12:48.300 --> 12:50.300
Store's closed Sundays and Mondays.

12:50.900 --> 12:53.500
Clerk comes in this morning,
gets an eyeful of this.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.300
Isn't this how you killed the
second victim in your book ?

13:09.300 --> 13:10.300
Yeah.

13:16.700 --> 13:19.300
Sadie Keller, 28, lived
in Chevy Chase.

13:19.400 --> 13:20.500
Wow, that was fast.

13:20.600 --> 13:21.400
Her face was chewed off.

13:21.500 --> 13:24.800
Aside from bite marks on her
parietal and sphenoid bones,

13:24.900 --> 13:28.300
skull was intact enough for Angela
to do a facial reconstruction.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.200
Yeah.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.600
Sadie Keller... recently married
to Ashton Keller, 29.

13:32.900 --> 13:34.000
No work history.

13:34.100 --> 13:35.900
Went to some pretty fancy
schools, though.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.300
- She was rich.
- Great. So we got

13:37.400 --> 13:41.000
a dead traveling salesman
and a prep school socialite.

13:41.100 --> 13:42.200
What the hell's the connection ?

13:42.400 --> 13:43.500
Not Greg Braley.

13:43.700 --> 13:44.900
His story checks out.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
He was camping the night
Lopata was killed.

13:47.100 --> 13:48.600
Two rangers recognized him.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.300
Oh, great. So the ly
connection we have

13:50.400 --> 13:52.600
is the tape he te fact that
they were both fed to anBOals.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.000
So we're back to me.

13:54.300 --> 13:55.100
No.

13:55.300 --> 13:56.400
Your book.

13:56.700 --> 13:58.800
I can only deal with
what's before me.

13:58.900 --> 14:00.600
Two discrete cases.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.000
Physical evidence.

14:02.100 --> 14:04.700
Look, Bones, I know it's
probably easier for you

14:04.800 --> 14:07.000
to believe that the cases
aren't linked...

14:07.100 --> 14:09.100
No, there's nothing that
would make the loss

14:09.200 --> 14:11.800
of two lives easier for me, Booth.

14:11.900 --> 14:13.300
- I'm sorry, but...
- I'm not burying

14:13.500 --> 14:14.700
my head in the sand here.

14:14.800 --> 14:17.200
I want to catch whoever did
this as much as you guys do.

14:17.300 --> 14:19.300
But I have a method.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.100
And the method doesn't change.

14:21.300 --> 14:22.800
I'll be back in my lab.

14:24.900 --> 14:27.400
She wasn't this emotional
before you came in the picture.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.000
I thought you weren't interested.

14:29.500 --> 14:32.200
Look, I don't need that, okay ?
Believe me, okay ?

14:32.300 --> 14:34.600
I'm gonna go talk to Sadie
Keller's husband.

14:34.700 --> 14:36.700
Why don't you just go back
to your office there

14:36.800 --> 14:39.000
and sort through
the fan mail, all right ?

14:41.100 --> 14:43.800
Got some phaenicia sericata
stuck in the tape.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.300
Means she's been dead
less than two days.

14:46.400 --> 14:47.900
Rats sure made quick work of her.

14:48.800 --> 14:51.900
So, all the victims in
Dr. Brennan's book got eaten ?

14:52.200 --> 14:53.500
Yeah, it was part of the metaphor.

14:53.900 --> 14:56.100
The victims were all corrupt
politicians who'd been

14:56.200 --> 14:58.400
feeding for years on the
goodwill of the people, so...

14:58.500 --> 14:59.200
I got it.

14:59.300 --> 15:01.700
Lots of gore with a splash
of social commentary.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.500
No wonder it's a bestseller.

15:03.600 --> 15:04.900
Ooh, good.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.100
Lots of tissue left over here.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.600
There's no exit wound.

15:08.700 --> 15:09.700
So we've got a bullet ?

15:10.600 --> 15:11.600
I don't see it.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.600
The tissue was too badly scavenged.

15:14.700 --> 15:16.400
But if the bullet was still
inside Sadie Keller

15:16.500 --> 15:18.500
when her body was dumped in the cage...

15:19.800 --> 15:21.600
We need to X-ray us some rodents.

15:26.100 --> 15:27.900
She was supposed
to be visiting a friend.

15:28.100 --> 15:29.800
And when she didn't
return your phone call...

15:30.600 --> 15:31.700
I just assumed...

15:34.100 --> 15:36.000
She was very independent,

15:36.400 --> 15:37.900
still kind of wild.

15:39.600 --> 15:42.300
I mean, she was used to
getting whatever she wanted.

15:44.600 --> 15:45.400
Like what ?

15:47.300 --> 15:49.200
Let's just say she wasn't
the wifely type.

15:50.800 --> 15:52.100
And since she had all the money,

15:53.200 --> 15:54.200
she thought she could, uh...

15:56.100 --> 15:56.900
you know.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.000
Do you know any of the men

16:00.100 --> 16:01.300
she might have seeing ?

16:02.800 --> 16:03.900
I didn't want to know.

16:05.100 --> 16:06.500
I just wanted it to blow over.

16:06.600 --> 16:07.900
I...

16:09.900 --> 16:11.300
I loved her.

16:12.700 --> 16:14.300
And I know that sounds pathetic

16:16.600 --> 16:17.700
but I just loved her.

16:22.100 --> 16:25.400
Forgive me, Mr. Keller,
but you stand to inherit

16:25.600 --> 16:26.800
quite a lot of money

16:27.700 --> 16:29.000
om your wife, don't you ?

16:30.300 --> 16:31.600
Yes, I do.

16:32.900 --> 16:35.200
I guess I shouldn't be surprised
that you suspect me.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.300
But I was out of town the
night that Sadie disappeared,

16:37.400 --> 16:38.300
at a golf tournament.

16:38.400 --> 16:40.000
I'll need the details.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.300
- Of course.
- Yeah.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.200
Sadie meant everything
to me, Agent Booth.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.000
And I know she loved me.

16:49.300 --> 16:50.400
Whatever happened...

16:51.200 --> 16:52.400
she did.

16:53.200 --> 16:54.400
I know that.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.900
They're cute, for rodents.

16:59.100 --> 17:01.000
Yeah, well, don't
grow too attached.

17:01.300 --> 17:04.099
These little guys are
destined to be snake snacks.

17:04.400 --> 17:05.800
But now that we've confiscated them,

17:05.900 --> 17:06.900
shouldn't they be safe ?

17:07.400 --> 17:09.200
I mean, they're material witnesses.

17:09.300 --> 17:12.200
It's not like they know
sign language, Angela.

17:12.300 --> 17:14.400
In grad school, I developed
a more efficient method

17:14.500 --> 17:16.500
for killing rats raior to dissection.

17:16.599 --> 17:18.099
It involved a warm dish of water

17:18.400 --> 17:20.599
and the clever use of
a ball-peen hammer.

17:20.700 --> 17:21.700
Zack... Uh !

17:21.900 --> 17:23.099
Found something.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.099
Wow.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Now what ?

17:27.099 --> 17:29.300
Warm water soothes them
like a bubble bath.

17:29.500 --> 17:30.300
Then...

17:30.400 --> 17:33.200
Can't we just wait until
nature takes its course ?

17:33.800 --> 17:36.300
Do you have any idea how
tight a rat's rectum is ?

17:36.900 --> 17:38.600
Please tell me you don't.

17:40.500 --> 17:41.800
Locate the ammo thief ?

17:41.900 --> 17:44.400
Yes, but we're debating the
method of bullet retrieval.

17:44.500 --> 17:47.500
Well, I fed them all a mixture
of extra-strength laxative

17:47.600 --> 17:49.500
and soft tissue dilator
when they arrived, so...

17:50.500 --> 17:51.500
shouldn't be long now.

17:53.500 --> 17:55.500
She fed all of them laxatives ?

17:56.800 --> 17:58.600
I need to go to my office.

18:03.900 --> 18:04.800
Lunch time.

18:04.900 --> 18:05.700
Ho !

18:06.800 --> 18:07.800
I'm not hungry.

18:08.600 --> 18:09.800
Come on, it's meatball.

18:09.900 --> 18:11.300
It's the perfect food.

18:11.600 --> 18:12.500
Shouldn't you be working ?

18:12.600 --> 18:14.000
I went through the fan mail

18:14.100 --> 18:16.400
and gave the likely candidates
to Booth to check out.

18:16.500 --> 18:17.900
Yeah, I'm busy, Sully.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.400
I'm cataloguing injuries
the two victims suffered.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.700
Hey, I am on your side, Tempe.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.400
I know what you're going through.

18:24.500 --> 18:25.500
Okay, what ?

18:26.400 --> 18:27.200
What, Sully ? What...

18:27.300 --> 18:28.700
What am I going through ?

18:33.100 --> 18:34.000
Okay.

18:35.700 --> 18:37.400
You feel responsible.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.000
You feel that somehow, if you
didn't write that book,

18:40.100 --> 18:42.200
those two people would still be ave.

18:43.100 --> 18:44.300
And you're terrified 'cause you know

18:44.400 --> 18:46.000
that someone else dies in the book.

18:46.900 --> 18:48.500
I don't put much credence
in psychology.

18:48.600 --> 18:50.000
Well, neither do I.

18:50.500 --> 18:53.200
I'm basing this on
knowing you... well.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.600
Knowing how much you care
about your work.

18:55.700 --> 18:58.200
And if trivializing it in the
book caused this, then...

18:58.900 --> 19:01.400
It just, but it doesn't
work like that, Tempe.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.600
Statistically, the murders
would have happened

19:03.700 --> 19:05.600
whether the book
was written or not.

19:05.700 --> 19:08.200
The method might be
different is all.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.300
Right.

19:10.600 --> 19:12.100
Now, if you only believed that.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.100
You don't know me
as well as you think.

19:14.900 --> 19:17.300
We're just having a fling,
so don't get carried away.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.700
When you can't stop
thinking about someone

19:24.800 --> 19:27.600
when they're not around,
that's not a fling.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.700
When you remember their touch
just like they were still

19:30.800 --> 19:32.600
right next to you,
that's not a fling.

19:32.700 --> 19:34.800
If you need to be alone
with this, fine.

19:35.900 --> 19:37.500
But we both know what we have.

19:48.600 --> 19:49.800
We have the bullet.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.600
The bullet was jacketed,
showing little deformity.

19:52.700 --> 19:55.400
And you've compared it with
the wounds on both victims ?

19:55.500 --> 19:57.900
Lack of shattering around the
exit wound on the first victim

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
suggests a jacketed projectile.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.400
And Angela's rendering also matches

20:02.500 --> 20:04.800
the bullet we recovered from the rat.

20:04.900 --> 20:06.700
Zack... Hey, Bones.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.800
I thought you and Sully were having lunch.

20:09.300 --> 20:10.200
Not hungry.

20:10.900 --> 20:14.200
Zack thinks both victims were
shot using the same gun.

20:14.400 --> 20:16.500
You said that Ashton Keller was

20:16.600 --> 20:17.900
going to get a large inheritance.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.400
Right. But his alibi is airtight.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.200
He was at Briarwood in Maine

20:21.300 --> 20:22.700
at a charity golf tournament.

20:22.900 --> 20:24.300
So much for that theory.

20:24.900 --> 20:25.900
Yeah, what about the red tape ?

20:25.900 --> 20:26.700
I mean, did Hodgins...

20:26.800 --> 20:27.600
It's the same.

20:27.700 --> 20:30.500
Same gun, same tape, no
relationship between the victims.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.600
I'm telling you, we're dealing
with a serial killer.

20:32.700 --> 20:33.900
He's just picking random targets.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.100
Nothing else makes sense here.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.300
But serial killers have a
pattern, a method of killing.

20:37.400 --> 20:41.400
The first victim has numerous defensive
wounds, including a fractured manubrium,

20:41.600 --> 20:43.400
and trauma to the temporal bone.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.400
There was quite a struggle
before he died.

20:45.900 --> 20:47.300
What about the second victim ?

20:47.300 --> 20:48.100
Nothing.

20:48.200 --> 20:49.400
Only the gunshot.

20:49.900 --> 20:51.000
Did you have something to show me ?

20:51.100 --> 20:52.800
Oh, new suspect.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.800
All right, Sully narrowed the
fan mail down to the people

20:55.900 --> 20:57.800
most likely to act out in obsessive

20:57.900 --> 20:59.000
or dangerous ways.

20:59.100 --> 20:59.900
But...

21:00.700 --> 21:02.200
look who I found, huh ?

21:03.900 --> 21:05.100
Your number one fan.

21:05.500 --> 21:06.300
Oliver.

21:06.900 --> 21:07.900
Haven't seen him in a while.

21:08.000 --> 21:08.900
Oliver Laurier.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.100
The guy who stalked you

21:10.200 --> 21:11.400
when we first started
working together.

21:11.500 --> 21:13.200
He used to come
to all my readings,

21:13.300 --> 21:14.400
follow me around afterwards.er

21:14.500 --> 21:16.400
It says here your publicist
gives his picture

21:16.500 --> 21:18.500
to security guards
at every signing.

21:18.800 --> 21:20.000
Must be why I haven't seen him.

21:20.200 --> 21:21.700
I think it's time for to go see

21:21.800 --> 21:24.300
what our buddy has been up to lately.

21:28.800 --> 21:29.600
Oliver ?

21:29.700 --> 21:30.700
You home ?

21:31.000 --> 21:31.900
Who is it ?

21:32.400 --> 21:33.700
It's an old friend.

21:37.000 --> 21:37.800
Special Agent Seeley Booth.

21:37.900 --> 21:39.000
You work with Dr. Brennan.

21:39.800 --> 21:40.800
Why are you here ?

21:40.900 --> 21:42.900
Well, you know, somebody loves
Dr. Brennan's new book

21:43.000 --> 21:45.200
just a little too much.

21:45.300 --> 21:47.000
And since you're such a big fan...

21:47.300 --> 21:48.400
Oh ! Okay.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.200
You know what ?
Not good idea, Oliver.

21:52.300 --> 21:53.100
Go away !

21:53.400 --> 21:54.300
All right.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.600
You know, this is probable cause.

21:56.700 --> 21:58.400
I'm gonna give you five seconds.

22:00.300 --> 22:01.200
Oliver !

22:02.400 --> 22:04.100
Five, four...

22:04.200 --> 22:05.900
I didn't do anything.
Three-two-one !

22:07.600 --> 22:09.500
My shrink is gonna be pissed.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.100
I didn't do anything.

22:26.100 --> 22:27.200
Of course you didn't.

22:29.000 --> 22:29.800
Come on.

22:30.000 --> 22:30.900
Yeah.

22:30.900 --> 22:31.700
Ow.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.200
If it was just a game,

22:45.600 --> 22:48.000
... why'd you slam the
door in my face ?

22:48.000 --> 22:48.800
I'm not stupid.

22:48.900 --> 22:50.200
I heard about the murders.

22:50.800 --> 22:53.600
And I knew you wouldn't
understand CRP.

22:53.700 --> 22:56.100
- CRP ?
- Creative role playing.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.300
Sometimes I like to pretend.

22:59.300 --> 23:02.600
I act out scenes from
my favorite books.

23:02.700 --> 23:06.100
Exactly, um, how far do
these "games" of yours go,

23:06.300 --> 23:07.100
Ollie ?

23:07.500 --> 23:09.900
You ever get tired of pleding
with your little dolls,

23:10.300 --> 23:12.500
maybe try acting it out
on other people ?

23:13.200 --> 23:14.900
Dr. Brennan's book
signing is tonight.

23:16.200 --> 23:17.400
I wanted to see her again.

23:18.400 --> 23:20.300
Let's stay on point here, Ollie.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.300
I am on point.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.700
I want to see Dr. Brennan.

23:22.900 --> 23:25.000
This isn't like going to see Santa,

23:25.200 --> 23:27.400
it's more like the principal's
office, you see.

23:27.500 --> 23:28.500
I'm in charge.

23:28.600 --> 23:29.600
I call the shots.

23:30.900 --> 23:33.500
Did you read Dr. Brennan's
new book, Agent Booth ?

23:33.600 --> 23:34.600
Why do you care ?

23:35.000 --> 23:36.600
Merely wondering if you know

23:36.700 --> 23:38.800
how many victims are in it.

23:41.400 --> 23:42.800
What's this about, Ollie ?

23:44.700 --> 23:46.300
I want to see Dr. Brennan.

23:47.700 --> 23:48.900
Santa.

23:52.400 --> 23:55.800
Sully asked Booth to double
security for my book reading.

23:55.900 --> 23:57.000
Hot.

23:57.100 --> 23:59.000
No, I don't need that kind of hot,

23:59.100 --> 24:01.500
being treated like a
damsel in distress.

24:01.900 --> 24:03.400
Sully cares about you, honey.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.200
It's a good thing.

24:04.300 --> 24:06.200
We've only been seeing
each other for a month.

24:06.300 --> 24:07.700
You know, he doesn't know me.

24:08.100 --> 24:09.000
Not really.

24:09.400 --> 24:11.200
And if he does, he won't like you ?

24:14.800 --> 24:17.200
I've already given up
too much to him.

24:17.300 --> 24:18.900
It's... this one or this one ?

24:19.400 --> 24:20.800
- This one.
- Okay.

24:22.300 --> 24:24.200
Most relationships end badly.

24:24.300 --> 24:27.500
I just think it's important
to... to be reasonable.

24:27.600 --> 24:28.700
To stay in control.

24:29.900 --> 24:32.100
Don't use your brain
so much, sweetie,

24:32.800 --> 24:35.500
you have other organs that can
give you far more pleasure.

24:36.200 --> 24:39.600
I'm just saying that the
odds are not in favor

24:39.700 --> 24:41.300
of lasting relationships.

24:43.300 --> 24:46.700
Look, it might end with Sully, sure.

24:47.700 --> 24:49.800
But I don't think you want
to rush the process.

24:50.300 --> 24:51.700
Look at Hodgins and I.

24:52.200 --> 24:54.600
We're running on sex and laughing.

24:55.200 --> 24:58.400
The only thought comes when
we order takeout in bed.

24:59.300 --> 25:00.200
And you're happy ?

25:00.800 --> 25:03.400
Hey, we did it in the storage
locker an hour ago.

25:03.900 --> 25:05.700
I am thrilled.

25:16.300 --> 25:18.600
Cam, I have a book signing tonight.

25:18.700 --> 25:20.200
Oh, right.

25:21.500 --> 25:22.700
You think that's safe ?

25:22.900 --> 25:25.900
Well, there haven't been
any threats on my life.

25:26.800 --> 25:28.500
No threats on these victims either.

25:29.700 --> 25:31.100
Is that the soft tissue sample

25:31.200 --> 25:32.800
from the second victim ?

25:32.900 --> 25:33.900
Sadie Keller.

25:34.600 --> 25:36.000
Found something irregular.

25:36.200 --> 25:39.300
Oxygen saturation levels in
the blood were extremely low.

25:39.800 --> 25:41.000
I think she might have
been unconscious

25:41.100 --> 25:42.200
before she was killed.

25:42.300 --> 25:44.000
That would explain the lack of struggle.

25:44.100 --> 25:46.900
But there was no skeletal
evidence of a head injury.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.500
I know, my guess would be
drug induced.

25:48.600 --> 25:49.700
I'm about to run a tox screen.

25:49.800 --> 25:52.800
Thing is, why would the killer
render this victim unconscious ?

25:52.900 --> 25:53.800
It doesn't follow.

25:53.900 --> 25:55.900
Serial killers are consistent.

25:56.300 --> 25:57.200
Wow !

25:57.600 --> 25:59.500
New dress code ?
'Cause I didn't get thmoge

26:00.600 --> 26:01.400
Okay.

26:01.500 --> 26:03.400
The sand I collected from
the first victim:

26:03.700 --> 26:05.500
it's from feldspathic rock.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.500
But that's widely occurring, right ?

26:07.500 --> 26:08.300
Right.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.800
Sixty percent of
the Earth's crust

26:09.900 --> 26:11.100
is composed of feldspar.

26:11.200 --> 26:13.000
So, this is no help to us.

26:13.100 --> 26:13.900
Actually, it is.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.900
These particles are way
too finely graduated

26:16.000 --> 26:17.300
to have occurred naturally.

26:17.500 --> 26:19.000
This is manufactured sand.

26:19.500 --> 26:20.500
Hi, Booth.

26:20.700 --> 26:22.200
Can we trace the manufacturer ?

26:22.300 --> 26:23.900
I've requested samples
from every quarry

26:24.000 --> 26:25.400
that distributes to the D.C. area,

26:25.500 --> 26:26.500
see if that narrows it down.

26:26.600 --> 26:27.500
Okay, ll be right there.

26:28.500 --> 26:30.600
Hey, be careful tonight.

26:30.700 --> 26:32.100
I'm not going to the signing yet.

26:32.300 --> 26:33.900
Booth has a suspect.

26:34.900 --> 26:37.000
Serial killers like to show off.

26:37.100 --> 26:38.700
Boast about their crimes.

26:39.300 --> 26:41.300
You might be able to get
him to open up.

26:41.400 --> 26:42.800
But you don't have to talk
to him if you don't want to.

26:42.900 --> 26:44.200
- I'm not afraid of him.
- I'm not saying

26:44.300 --> 26:45.700
that you are, I'm just
saying... I'll be back.

26:46.800 --> 26:47.700
She'll be back.

26:48.500 --> 26:49.400
That means...

26:51.300 --> 26:53.300
Everything with you two, uh...

26:54.600 --> 26:56.300
Well, you know what ? Never mind.

26:58.500 --> 26:59.500
Wow.

26:59.800 --> 27:02.200
It's like you dressed up
just to see me again.

27:02.300 --> 27:05.400
I can assure you, Oliver,
that, that's not the case.

27:05.900 --> 27:07.600
But that's what it feels like.

27:08.200 --> 27:09.000
To me.

27:09.700 --> 27:12.100
Did you kill those people, Oliver ?

27:12.200 --> 27:14.500
I... can't answer that yet.

27:14.700 --> 27:16.400
I want to talk a while first.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.200
The dead bodies, is it true ?

27:18.900 --> 27:19.700
Did they really get eaten ?

27:19.800 --> 27:20.700
Like in the book ?

27:20.900 --> 27:22.800
Yes, they did.

27:23.300 --> 27:24.700
I knew it.

27:24.800 --> 27:26.900
Some of the Brennanites
were skeptical

27:27.000 --> 27:28.500
that the deaths were realistic,

27:28.600 --> 27:29.600
but I told them.

27:29.700 --> 27:30.900
Did he say "Brennanites" ?

27:31.000 --> 27:32.300
Did you say "Brennanites" ?

27:32.400 --> 27:34.200
Murder Mystery Chat Room members.

27:34.400 --> 27:36.100
See, all chat room members
have to identify

27:36.200 --> 27:38.100
themselves with their
favorite author.

27:38.600 --> 27:40.900
I'm a Brennanite,
of course,

27:41.700 --> 27:43.400
but there are also, uh,

27:43.700 --> 27:45.700
Pattersonians and Graftonadas.

27:45.800 --> 27:48.700
Okay, Oliver, I understand.
What did you tell them ?

27:49.300 --> 27:51.300
That you couldn't make
those things up.

27:51.400 --> 27:55.100
Everything you write is based
in fact, it could really happen.

27:55.700 --> 27:58.500
Oliver, I want to talk
about the murders.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.200
You look so beautiful.

28:02.900 --> 28:04.600
Maybe I could get
a picture of us together.

28:04.700 --> 28:06.600
The murders, Oliver.

28:06.900 --> 28:09.600
I know you just dismiss
me as another fan,

28:10.900 --> 28:12.600
but once you get to know me,

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
you realize

28:15.100 --> 28:16.100
I'm an interesting man.

28:16.200 --> 28:18.500
No touching, Oliver.

28:18.600 --> 28:20.200
Okay, end of interview.

28:20.900 --> 28:22.300
Seems like a good call.

28:23.300 --> 28:24.400
Let's go.

28:24.500 --> 28:25.400
No, we want to be alone.

28:25.500 --> 28:26.800
You blew your chance
for that, okay.

28:26.900 --> 28:27.700
You can sit in a cell

28:27.800 --> 28:29.000
till you're ready to talk.

28:29.200 --> 28:30.900
Wait, don't leave yet. Not yet.

28:32.200 --> 28:33.500
O-kay.

28:33.800 --> 28:35.900
- Ow, my nose.
- See,

28:36.000 --> 28:37.700
I can take care of myself.

28:38.100 --> 28:39.600
Yeah, you'd better watch it, dude.

28:42.900 --> 28:44.300
Oh, my...

28:44.800 --> 28:46.000
There's so much...

28:52.500 --> 28:53.900
The guy faints at the sight of blood.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.600
- He has vasovagal syncope.
- Wait

28:55.700 --> 28:58.900
there's no way he's the killer,
he just wanted your attention.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.200
All right, so we're
back'r to square one.

29:00.300 --> 29:03.100
All right the, uh, the book
is the only connection...

29:03.300 --> 29:05.400
It sold 400,000 copies already.

29:05.500 --> 29:07.600
That's a pretty big pool
of people to question.

29:07.700 --> 29:09.300
I'm going to be late for my reading.

29:09.400 --> 29:11.100
Wait, there's still
potentially one more victim.

29:11.200 --> 29:12.700
I think you should cancel.

29:12.900 --> 29:15.500
What the, the killer's ter me, Sully.

29:15.900 --> 29:17.200
If he is using the book,

29:17.300 --> 29:19.500
that makes me the object
of these actions,

29:19.600 --> 29:20.700
not the target.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.700
I mean, you're the profiler, right ?

29:22.800 --> 29:24.500
I'm just trying to help.

29:24.600 --> 29:26.500
Well, you're making this,
this personal.

29:26.600 --> 29:27.800
You got yourself assigned to this case

29:27.900 --> 29:29.200
just because of me. Absolutely !

29:29.300 --> 29:30.800
What you'r gonna give me
more crap now

29:30.900 --> 29:32.300
because I care about you ?

29:32.400 --> 29:33.600
I'll be over here
making a few calls.

29:33.700 --> 29:34.700
A little help, Booth.

29:34.800 --> 29:36.200
Do you think she should go alone ?

29:36.300 --> 29:37.400
No, no, not alone,

29:37.500 --> 29:39.200
but there seems to be other
stuff going on here.

29:39.200 --> 29:40.000
I don't want to get involved.

29:40.100 --> 29:41.800
No, you agreed wagrem,
you are involved.

29:41.900 --> 29:43.000
All right, so let Booth take you,

29:43.100 --> 29:44.800
and that way, it won't be
personal between us.

29:44.800 --> 29:45.600
- Fine.
- Fine.

29:45.700 --> 29:46.500
- Fine !
- Fine.

29:47.500 --> 29:48.400
Fine.

29:56.600 --> 29:57.400
Oh, my...

29:57.500 --> 29:59.600
Ellen is going to be so upset
you didn't take the car.

29:59.700 --> 30:02.100
No, it's okay, I wanted
to go with Booth.

30:02.200 --> 30:03.300
You're not gonna get in trouble.

30:04.000 --> 30:04.800
Man, you're shaking.

30:04.900 --> 30:06.500
- Are you okay ?
- Oh, yeah.

30:06.600 --> 30:07.400
I'm fine, it's my own fault.

30:07.500 --> 30:10.000
I'm diabetic and I have
not had time to eat.

30:10.100 --> 30:11.800
And Ellen's not here yet.

30:11.900 --> 30:13.900
What, do you have any food, Candy ?

30:14.000 --> 30:14.800
Yeah.

30:14.900 --> 30:17.400
I got a half-eaten chocolate
bar, caramel center...

30:17.500 --> 30:19.000
Wow. Here, eat.

30:19.200 --> 30:20.800
You need the sugar.

30:21.000 --> 30:21.800
Where, where's Ellen ?

30:21.900 --> 30:22.700
I don't know.

30:22.800 --> 30:25.400
She went home to hours ago
to change her clothes.

30:25.500 --> 30:27.000
Left me to handle everything.

30:27.100 --> 30:29.100
There was almost a riot over
the seating arrangements.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.300
Well, did you call her ?

30:30.600 --> 30:31.400
Who, Ellen ?

30:31.500 --> 30:33.600
I can't. She left her
Blackberry as usual,

30:33.700 --> 30:35.800
for me to answer, so I would
actually be calling...

30:36.200 --> 30:37.100
myself.

30:37.200 --> 30:38.400
This is, this is not like her.

30:38.500 --> 30:39.600
She's never late.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.600
All right, look, I'll send
a car by her place,

30:41.700 --> 30:42.700
check things out, all right.

30:42.800 --> 30:43.400
Thanks.

30:43.500 --> 30:44.900
I'll go in and get them
ready for you.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.600
You can use the back entrance
to avoid the nuts.

30:47.700 --> 30:51.100
Oh, um, the candy was a little linty,

30:51.200 --> 30:52.000
but...

30:52.400 --> 30:53.500
thank you.

30:55.200 --> 30:56.500
Linty ?

30:59.100 --> 31:00.200
Quite a line of people there.

31:00.300 --> 31:01.700
A lot of fans, Bones.

31:03.900 --> 31:04.700
All right, whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:04.800 --> 31:05.600
Hold it right there.

31:05.600 --> 31:06.400
Whoa.

31:06.500 --> 31:07.600
FBI, hands in the air.

31:07.700 --> 31:09.000
I just wanted an autograph.

31:10.900 --> 31:13.300
Okay, just wait till the Doc
gets inside, okay, pal ?

31:17.800 --> 31:19.000
I'm sorry, love your book.

31:19.300 --> 31:20.200
Was that necessary ?

31:20.300 --> 31:22.200
Just doing my job, okay Bones.

31:22.300 --> 31:23.800
Are you gonna come at me
like you came at Sully ?

31:23.900 --> 31:24.700
What is that supposed to mean ?

31:24.800 --> 31:27.100
Far be it for me to stick
my nose into your bedroom,

31:27.200 --> 31:29.200
but I've known Sully a long
time, and believe me,

31:29.300 --> 31:30.600
he's one of the good guys.

31:30.700 --> 31:32.100
Well, I know Sully, Booth.

31:32.200 --> 31:33.200
Yeah, and I know you.

31:33.300 --> 31:34.300
All right, somebody
gets too close,

31:34.400 --> 31:35.600
you just want to push them away.

31:35.700 --> 31:38.000
I think you're taking your
therapy a little too seriously.

31:38.100 --> 31:40.000
Maybe, maybe not,
come on, let's go.

31:41.100 --> 31:41.900
What ?

31:48.800 --> 31:50.500
What the hell is that ?

31:51.500 --> 31:52.400
Oh, no.

31:52.500 --> 31:54.200
Booth, they're fire ants.

31:54.600 --> 31:56.100
Just like the book.

31:56.900 --> 31:58.200
The third body.

31:58.900 --> 32:00.800
Oh, okay, there it is.

32:01.600 --> 32:02.500
Oh !

32:03.600 --> 32:05.600
Careful, Booth, don't let
them get on you.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Oh...

32:22.800 --> 32:23.900
It's Ellen.

32:28.100 --> 32:29.700
We have to be careful
with fire ants.

32:30.100 --> 32:31.600
ey're extremy dangerous.

32:31.800 --> 32:33.500
I think the victim
would agree with you.

32:33.800 --> 32:35.100
I asked them to pull the book,

32:35.200 --> 32:37.700
but according to my contract,
I don't have that right.

32:37.900 --> 32:40.300
I heard sales are increasing
because of the murders.

32:40.700 --> 32:41.700
It's sick.

32:41.900 --> 32:43.300
These are real people,

32:43.400 --> 32:44.600
not characters.

32:44.900 --> 32:46.900
Just rember: at the
end your books,

32:47.500 --> 32:49.100
Kathy Reichs always
gets the murderer.

32:50.300 --> 32:51.300
How long will this take ?

32:51.400 --> 32:53.200
Long as it takes to get
every last one of th.

32:53.300 --> 32:55.100
Introducing fire ants
into the ecosystem

32:55.200 --> 32:57.000
around here would be
extremely devastating.

32:57.100 --> 32:58.000
What about the crime scene ?

32:58.100 --> 32:59.300
It was covered.

32:59.400 --> 33:01.300
Yeah, I had to fight
fire with fire,

33:01.500 --> 33:03.400
or in this case,
fire ants with fire.

33:03.500 --> 33:05.200
Meaning... Had to scorch it.

33:05.300 --> 33:06.500
Used a flame thrower.

33:06.800 --> 33:08.800
Dude, it was like Ghostbusters,
the way they all went up.

33:08.900 --> 33:10.100
We get the idea, thanks.

33:10.200 --> 33:11.900
Bullet hole is visible now.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.800
Around the C-2 vertebra.

33:15.100 --> 33:16.200
Close range.

33:16.400 --> 33:18.500
Each shot in a different
part of the body.

33:19.100 --> 33:21.700
Very unusual for someone
who executes his victims.

33:23.500 --> 33:26.200
Data retrieval went through
Ellen Laskow's Blackberry.

33:26.500 --> 33:27.900
Found a text messaging address,

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
used only once about six months ago.

33:30.100 --> 33:33.900
Former work number of Ashton Keller,
Sadie Keller's husband.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.800
Oh, wait, our-our third victim knew

33:35.900 --> 33:37.500
our second victim's husband ?

33:37.600 --> 33:39.400
Asht Keller said his wife
was fooling around.

33:39.500 --> 33:41.200
Maybe Ashton was fooling
around with Ellen.

33:41.300 --> 33:42.700
He was a good-looking young guy.

33:42.800 --> 33:44.900
She was a scary publicist.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.300
No accounting for taste.

33:47.300 --> 33:48.100
Well, I'll, uh...

33:48.400 --> 33:50.000
... see what the publicist's
assistant knows.

33:50.100 --> 33:51.800
They're always covering
for their bosses, right ?

33:51.900 --> 33:53.200
Let's hope so.

33:53.400 --> 33:54.700
I'll look for any
other connections

33:54.800 --> 33:56.900
between Ashton Keller
and our first victim.

33:57.200 --> 33:58.100
Okay.

33:59.100 --> 34:02.200
Hey, uh, how's Brennan
holding up ?

34:03.500 --> 34:05.000
Why don't you ask her yourself ?

34:05.300 --> 34:09.300
I'm... I'm not sure she's
exactly receptive right now.

34:11.500 --> 34:14.900
Listen, don't let her bully
you into leaving, man.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.800
- All right ?
- Yeah.

34:23.800 --> 34:27.100
I... woke up this morning
and picked up her cleaning

34:27.199 --> 34:28.400
like always.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.699
Stupid, huh ?

34:31.800 --> 34:34.600
I just... I can't get
used to the fact

34:34.699 --> 34:36.300
that she's not here anymore.

34:37.400 --> 34:39.000
You need candy bar or something ?

34:39.300 --> 34:40.600
No, I'm okay.

34:40.900 --> 34:42.100
Thanks.

34:43.300 --> 34:46.199
So... is it the same person
who killed the other two ?

34:46.900 --> 34:47.800
We don't know yet.

34:48.000 --> 34:48.800
When she didn't show up,

34:48.900 --> 34:51.300
I should have driven
back to get her.

34:54.600 --> 34:56.800
Was she, uh, having an affair ?

35:03.600 --> 35:06.900
She had... lovers.

35:08.600 --> 35:09.800
Women.

35:10.600 --> 35:13.900
I don't know why she was so
secretive in this day and age,

35:14.000 --> 35:17.300
but I was the only person
in the office who knew.

35:17.600 --> 35:18.900
Did she know Sadie Keller ?

35:19.700 --> 35:20.800
The other victim ?

35:21.600 --> 35:22.400
W-Were they... ?

35:22.500 --> 35:24.300
If you can think of anything
that might connect them...

35:24.400 --> 35:27.500
Of course; I'll go through my
old records and date books.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.400
Great. Thanks.

35:30.500 --> 35:32.700
The ridging along the edges
is almost identical.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.500
I'd say the third bullet
was definitely shot

35:34.600 --> 35:36.200
from the same barrel
as the first two.

35:36.300 --> 35:38.500
Same glass cloth tape used
on body number three.

35:38.600 --> 35:40.500
So why are all the attacks different ?

35:41.400 --> 35:43.600
The first victim, Jim Lopata,

35:43.700 --> 35:45.800
shows signs of a physical
attack before he was shot,

35:45.900 --> 35:47.800
and look at the angle
of the gunshot.

35:47.900 --> 35:49.400
Through the forehead,
execution style.

35:49.500 --> 35:51.700
And the second victim, Sadie Keller,

35:51.800 --> 35:55.100
shows absolutely no sign of
a struggle as if she were drugged.

35:55.200 --> 35:57.100
But the toxicology screen
came back negative.

35:57.200 --> 35:58.300
And the gunshot in this body

35:58.400 --> 35:59.400
was straight through the heart.

35:59.400 --> 36:00.200
The killer didn't want to see

36:00.300 --> 36:01.600
his victim's face get blown off.

36:01.700 --> 36:04.600
And Ellen was shot at close
range in the back of the neck.

36:04.800 --> 36:06.400
I've never seen a pattern like that.

36:06.500 --> 36:08.000
I don't think it is a pattern.

36:08.100 --> 36:10.800
I think there were three
separate killers.

36:15.200 --> 36:17.500
Any more leads off the third vic ?
Yeah, I'm working on it.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.100
Brennan called,
the publicist took a shot

36:19.200 --> 36:20.000
to the back of the neck.

36:20.100 --> 36:21.700
She thinks we have three
separate killers.

36:21.800 --> 36:22.800
That's a hell of a coincidence.

36:22.900 --> 36:24.200
Or one hell of a conspiracy.

36:24.300 --> 36:25.400
You know, she sounded
pretty certain,

36:25.500 --> 36:28.300
and I trust her when she's all
calm and relaxed.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.500
Uh, so the text message.

36:31.600 --> 36:34.300
Uh, Ellen Laskow writes
Ashton Kelle

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
comes clean about her and
Sadie, Ashton is enraged...

36:38.100 --> 36:39.100
No, it was Hank.

36:39.500 --> 36:40.900
The assistant ?
What ? What about him ?

36:41.000 --> 36:43.400
He said that he always carried
Ellen's Blackberry.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.700
So maybe it wasn't
Ellen who knew Ashton

36:45.800 --> 36:46.900
That's right.

36:47.600 --> 36:48.600
It was Hank.

36:50.100 --> 36:53.100
I found a quarry sample that matches
the sand found on the first body.

36:53.200 --> 36:55.800
It was distributed by the Irving
Company of West Virginia,

36:55.900 --> 36:58.400
used exclusively by country
clubs nationwide.

36:58.500 --> 37:00.400
Only a few clubs in this area,
though, so I've got a list.

37:00.500 --> 37:02.100
W-Why do country clubs need sand ?

37:02.200 --> 37:04.100
- For golf courses.
- All right, Bones.

37:04.200 --> 37:06.100
You're right; we're dealing with
three separate killers.

37:06.200 --> 37:08.000
Somehow they all know each other
and they're using your book

37:08.100 --> 37:09.700
to make it look like one person.

37:09.800 --> 37:10.600
What are we talking about ?

37:10.700 --> 37:12.000
Motive, Bones, okay, motive.

37:12.100 --> 37:14.000
Victim one was beating his wife,

37:14.100 --> 37:17.000
second victim left her money
to her lazy-ass husband...

37:17.100 --> 37:20.600
Victim three's Ellen, who...
seemed lonely, so...

37:20.700 --> 37:23.000
Bones, don't try the
psychological stuff.

37:23.100 --> 37:24.500
It's really not a pretty sight.

37:24.600 --> 37:26.200
Ellen was hated by Hank,

37:26.300 --> 37:28.100
who was also next
in line for her job.

37:28.200 --> 37:30.300
Hey, good work, Hodgins.

37:30.300 --> 37:31.100
Thanks.

37:31.200 --> 37:33.700
So our suspects agreed
to kill for each other

37:33.800 --> 37:35.300
so they'd each have and alibi ?

37:35.400 --> 37:38.200
So all I need from you people
is some proof, okay ?

37:38.500 --> 37:39.700
Oh, is that all ?

37:39.800 --> 37:40.600
Wait.

37:40.700 --> 37:41.500
The sand.

37:41.600 --> 37:43.900
Didn't you say that Ashton Keller
was a big golfer ?

37:44.000 --> 37:45.600
Yeah, he plays nine holes
at least every day

37:45.700 --> 37:48.100
at the, uh, Rockville Country Club.

37:53.300 --> 37:54.800
Yep. Rockville Country Club.

37:55.200 --> 37:56.900
It is the only golf course
in Maryland

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
that gets their sand from Irving.

37:58.100 --> 38:00.400
Okay, so if Ashton killed Jim,

38:00.600 --> 38:03.000
that would mean Hank killed Sadie.

38:03.200 --> 38:04.600
What do we know about Hank ?

38:04.900 --> 38:06.200
Not much.

38:06.300 --> 38:08.400
Hardworking, smart, diabetic...

38:09.200 --> 38:10.500
Diabetic.

38:10.700 --> 38:11.700
That's it.

38:12.400 --> 38:13.400
Cam !

38:14.800 --> 38:17.600
The killer injected Sadie with
an excessive amount of insulin

38:17.700 --> 38:18.900
to render her unconscious.

38:19.200 --> 38:21.900
Being a diabetic, Hank would
have easy access to insulin.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.800
Why didn't that show up
in the tox screen ?

38:23.900 --> 38:26.400
Because insulin is a naturally
occurring substance in the body.

38:26.500 --> 38:29.100
We were only looking
for analgesics and depressants.

38:29.200 --> 38:31.100
Yeah, okay. What about
the third body, Ellen's ?

38:31.500 --> 38:34.800
The tape and the ants did a great
deal of damage to the epidermis.

38:34.900 --> 38:37.400
It's been difficult to get
a narrative of the injuries.

38:38.000 --> 38:38.800
Okay.

38:40.000 --> 38:40.800
What's that ?

38:40.900 --> 38:42.200
Cam is going to examine the body

38:42.300 --> 38:45.600
with a reflective
ultraviolet lens,

38:45.700 --> 38:47.000
see if that gives us anything.

38:47.100 --> 38:49.100
I filtered the lens
so that it only allows

38:49.200 --> 38:51.600
UV wave lengths of less
than 400 nanometers.

38:51.700 --> 38:52.800
That way,

38:52.900 --> 38:54.900
we can see bruises
and injury patterns

38:55.000 --> 38:56.100
that are normally invisible.

38:56.200 --> 38:57.500
Okay, have fun with that.

38:59.100 --> 38:59.900
Booth.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.600
Long bruise there,

39:02.200 --> 39:03.700
as if the killer had his arm

39:03.800 --> 39:05.600
around her neck.

39:05.700 --> 39:07.400
And these marks on the arms...

39:08.600 --> 39:10.100
they look like handprints.

39:10.900 --> 39:14.400
Think her killer grabbed her
repeatedly all along her arms.

39:14.800 --> 39:16.100
Hands...

39:16.300 --> 39:17.500
May I ?

39:17.600 --> 39:19.300
Well, Sully got confirmation

39:19.400 --> 39:20.600
on the connection between the killers.

39:20.600 --> 39:21.400
Which is ?

39:21.500 --> 39:23.400
The Brennanite chat room
that Oliver mentioned,

39:23.500 --> 39:26.000
the FBI tech squad traced
the screen names.

39:26.200 --> 39:29.000
Greg Braley, Ashton Keller,
Hank Belden,

39:29.700 --> 39:30.800
they're all members.

39:33.000 --> 39:33.800
Look.

39:36.400 --> 39:38.600
Syndactyly on the right hand.

39:39.100 --> 39:42.100
We can link Greg Braley
to Ellen Laskow's death.

39:42.500 --> 39:43.300
All three murders,

39:43.400 --> 39:45.900
each one linked forensically
to one of the three suspects.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
Not bad.

39:49.600 --> 39:50.500
What are you waiting for, Booth ?

39:50.600 --> 39:51.700
Go get the bad guys.

39:51.900 --> 39:53.000
That's a good idea.

40:37.600 --> 40:38.700
Tell you something, all right ?

40:38.900 --> 40:41.800
Sales of your book are gonna
skyrocket after this.

40:41.900 --> 40:43.600
The only problem is our ending is

40:43.700 --> 40:45.100
a lot better than the one
I wrote in the book.

40:45.200 --> 40:46.800
What, are you kidding me, huh ?

40:47.000 --> 40:50.100
Kathy Reichs and the FBI guy
in the back of the AMG...

40:51.000 --> 40:52.100
The arrest.

40:52.200 --> 40:53.900
Oh, yeah, that.

40:55.000 --> 40:55.800
Sully.

40:55.900 --> 40:57.500
Yeah, you know, you really
should apologize.

40:57.600 --> 40:59.700
I mean, you were really
ragging on the guy.

40:59.800 --> 41:01.200
He seems a little frail.

41:01.700 --> 41:04.200
I'm a lot stronger than I look.

41:06.800 --> 41:08.200
Oh. You were...

41:09.700 --> 41:11.500
- Hey, Sul.
- Hey.

41:12.600 --> 41:14.500
So, congratulations.

41:15.100 --> 41:18.000
You guys make a great team.

41:18.900 --> 41:20.400
Mm-hmm. That's true.

41:21.900 --> 41:23.100
So true.

41:23.300 --> 41:24.500
Thanks for your help.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
Sure.

41:34.300 --> 41:36.300
You know, I-I should run... Bones.

41:36.400 --> 41:37.900
You know, I got stuff.

41:42.400 --> 41:43.500
See you at work, Sul.

41:43.600 --> 41:44.700
Yeah, I'll see you, man.

41:52.300 --> 41:53.300
I...

41:55.300 --> 41:57.300
I did feel responsible, Sully.

41:59.900 --> 42:00.800
Do.

42:01.300 --> 42:04.000
And you thought if I saw you vulnerable,

42:05.000 --> 42:06.800
needing me, I'd run ?

42:07.600 --> 42:09.200
I've been alone my whole life.

42:12.200 --> 42:13.200
It's all I know.

42:14.700 --> 42:16.700
Eh, don't worry.

42:18.300 --> 42:20.100
You'll learn fast.
