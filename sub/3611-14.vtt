00:02.003 --> 00:05.666
Previously on Lost:

00:05.756 --> 00:07.166
Desmond.

00:07.675 --> 00:10.963
I need you to go back
to Oxford University.

00:11.053 --> 00:14.762
Back to where we met. I need you to go
and find my mother. Her name is...

00:16.767 --> 00:19.509
What happens if I can't
get them all to come back?

00:19.604 --> 00:21.310
Then God help us all.

00:21.397 --> 00:25.185
I'm going back to the island today,
just as soon as I do one thing:

00:25.276 --> 00:26.482
kill your daughter.

00:26.569 --> 00:27.684
What are you doing here?

00:29.614 --> 00:30.979
Desmond!

00:37.079 --> 00:38.410
He's coding!

00:39.957 --> 00:42.289
- Gunshot wound. He's crashing!
- Bay seven.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.082
- Gonna be OK?
- Gonna have to wait.

00:44.170 --> 00:46.331
- What's happening?
- Please, wait here.

00:46.422 --> 00:49.664
- We'll let you know.
- What's happening? Is he gonna be OK?

00:49.759 --> 00:52.876
We're gonna do everything we can.
Please just wait.

00:52.970 --> 00:56.053
- Daddy!
- He's gonna be OK.

00:56.140 --> 00:57.846
He's gonna be OK.

01:08.611 --> 01:10.317
How old is your son?

01:11.072 --> 01:12.937
He's two.

01:16.118 --> 01:18.200
He has his father's hair.

01:21.958 --> 01:26.327
- I'm sorry, do I know you?
- No, but your husband does.

01:27.129 --> 01:28.539
l'm Eloise Hawking.

01:28.631 --> 01:34.547
And I believe it's my son's fault
that Desmond has been shot.

01:35.680 --> 01:40.174
- Your son is Benjamin Linus?
- Good Lord, no.

01:42.812 --> 01:46.304
My son is Daniel Faraday.

01:56.284 --> 01:57.990
Hey, can I get a hand with this?

02:06.294 --> 02:09.502
- Dan?
- Hey, Miles.

02:10.589 --> 02:11.578
Long time, no see.

02:11.674 --> 02:14.381
Ladies and gentlemen,
you know why you're here.

02:14.468 --> 02:18.586
- Wish you could get...
- What the hell are you doing back?

02:18.681 --> 02:21.593
Once you left for Ann Arbor,
I figured you'd gotten rich

02:21.684 --> 02:25.643
- inventing the DVD or something.
- This is what I'm doing back here.

02:26.731 --> 02:28.938
- When did they get here?
- A few days ago.

02:29.025 --> 02:30.185
It's weird, huh?

02:30.276 --> 02:32.312
- LaFleur...
- We don't have time.

02:32.403 --> 02:34.644
I need you to
take me to Jack's, right now.

02:44.665 --> 02:47.281
- Jack, how did you get back?
- Faraday? What the...

02:47.376 --> 02:50.118
How did you do it?
How did you get back to the island?

02:50.212 --> 02:53.454
- Where have you been?
- At Dharma headquarters in Ann Arbor.

02:53.549 --> 02:56.006
Doing research.
What's important right now...

02:56.093 --> 02:59.506
How did you get back here? To 1977?

02:59.597 --> 03:01.303
- What's going on?
- Don't look at me.

03:01.390 --> 03:05.008
- | just carried his luggage.
- Jack, how?

03:05.936 --> 03:10.350
- We were on a plane, and...
- Who told you to get on a plane?

03:10.441 --> 03:13.103
As a matter of fact, Dan,
it was your mother.

03:15.404 --> 03:17.986
And how did she convince you, Jack?

03:18.074 --> 03:21.191
Did she tell you it was your destiny?

03:22.828 --> 03:24.944
Yeah. That's exactly what she said.

03:25.039 --> 03:27.655
Well, I've got some
bad news for you, Jack.

03:27.750 --> 03:30.082
You don't belong here at all.

03:31.212 --> 03:32.873
She was wrong.

04:20.511 --> 04:23.878
What's wrong, Mom? Didn't you like it?

04:24.014 --> 04:26.050
llovedit

04:27.977 --> 04:29.308
It was beautiful, Daniel.

04:38.362 --> 04:39.977
Daniel...

04:41.198 --> 04:43.814
Do you know what destiny means?

04:45.369 --> 04:47.360
- No.
- Destiny means that

04:47.496 --> 04:50.408
if one has a special gift...

04:51.667 --> 04:53.874
...then it must be nurtured.

04:56.046 --> 04:59.379
How many beats has that metronome
counted since you started playing?

04:59.508 --> 05:02.750
Eight hundred sixty-four.

05:07.558 --> 05:09.890
Your gift, Daniel, is your mind.

05:10.019 --> 05:13.728
A mind that is meant
for science, mathematics.

05:13.856 --> 05:15.392
And it's my...

05:16.066 --> 05:18.523
...job...

05:18.611 --> 05:21.148
...to keep you on your path.

05:22.239 --> 05:25.652
So unfortunately,

05:25.743 --> 05:29.577
there's no more time for distractions.

05:29.663 --> 05:34.248
But I want to keep playing the piano.
I can do both.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.833
I can make time.

05:39.131 --> 05:41.417
If only you could.

05:50.017 --> 05:53.134
Miles, I need you to bring me to
the Orchid. Can you drive me now?

05:53.229 --> 05:55.015
- Sure, I guess.
- Thank you.

05:56.357 --> 05:57.392
Come on.

05:57.483 --> 05:59.974
- Faraday, wait up!
- Be right back.

06:00.110 --> 06:02.192
What did you mean,
your mother was wrong?

06:02.279 --> 06:05.316
- Daniel!
- | just have an errand to run.

06:05.449 --> 06:07.280
Be right back!

06:14.792 --> 06:16.453
- Yeah?
- Faraday's back.

06:17.503 --> 06:20.495
- What do you mean? Why?
- l have no idea.

06:20.631 --> 06:24.294
He came in on the sub. He woke me up,
he started talking nonsense.

06:24.385 --> 06:26.216
And then he took off to the Orchid.

06:26.595 --> 06:29.678
I'd love to trade theories about this,
but I'm a little busy.

06:29.765 --> 06:31.721
What are you busy with
at 6:00 in the morning?

06:31.809 --> 06:33.640
James, tell him.

06:35.479 --> 06:36.844
Get in here.

06:43.529 --> 06:48.444
Phil, one of my security guys,
got himself a videotape of me and Kate

06:48.534 --> 06:50.274
taking the kid out to the Hostiles.

06:51.203 --> 06:53.990
- And where's the tape?
- With Phil.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.867
And where's Phil?

06:58.502 --> 07:01.585
Phil, Jack. Jack, Phil.

07:12.224 --> 07:15.682
Are we waiting for something?

07:20.357 --> 07:22.393
Right on time.

07:49.428 --> 07:52.295
- So what do you want me to do?
- You're gonna do nothing.

07:52.389 --> 07:55.881
If you drill one centimeter further,
you risk releasing that energy.

07:56.060 --> 08:00.599
lfthat were to happen, God help us all.

08:00.731 --> 08:03.518
Hey! You need a hard hat down here.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.863
- Watch yourself!
- Sorry, sir, won't happen again.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.378
l'll grab the rest of the stuff.
Let's go.

08:29.134 --> 08:32.171
Did you hear that? Time travel.

08:32.262 --> 08:34.093
How stupid does that guy think we are?

08:39.103 --> 08:42.311
Dr. Chang?
Dr. Chang, do you have a second, sir?

08:43.524 --> 08:44.559
lsuppose.

08:44.650 --> 08:48.393
| just came in on the sub with
the Swan team. We met three years ago.

08:48.487 --> 08:51.979
- l'm Daniel Faraday.
- You arrived with LaFleur. I remember.

08:52.116 --> 08:53.151
What can I do for you?

08:53.283 --> 08:56.070
I need you to order the evacuation

08:56.161 --> 08:58.538
of every man, woman and child
on this island.

08:59.331 --> 09:00.446
Why would I do that?

09:00.541 --> 09:03.533
Because that man is on a stretcher
as a consequence

09:03.627 --> 09:07.791
of the electromagnetic activity
that your drilling unleashed down here.

09:09.967 --> 09:12.333
Which is now contained.

09:14.805 --> 09:17.638
lt's contained down here.

09:17.766 --> 09:20.974
But in about six hours,
the same thing is going to happen

09:21.061 --> 09:22.801
at the site for the Swan station,

09:22.896 --> 09:27.606
only the energy there is about
30,000 times more powerful.

09:32.281 --> 09:34.192
That is utterly absurd.

09:34.283 --> 09:36.945
What could possibly qualify
you to make that prediction?

09:40.831 --> 09:43.493
I'm from the future.

09:52.301 --> 09:54.587
Dr. Chang, wait.
Will you wait one second?

09:54.678 --> 09:57.670
Yes, yes, you're from the future.

09:57.765 --> 10:00.051
You heard me talking about time travel.

10:00.184 --> 10:03.642
- You've had your fun, good for you.
- No, please, Dr. Chang.

10:03.729 --> 10:06.846
Just look at my journal, please.
Look at these equations.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.807
Some of them won't be discovered
for another 20 years.

10:09.902 --> 10:11.767
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Dr. Chang...

10:11.862 --> 10:12.942
Leave the man alone.

10:13.030 --> 10:15.237
Sorry, he had
too many drugs on the sub...

10:15.324 --> 10:16.985
Dr. Chang.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.029
Miles is your son.

10:23.540 --> 10:24.996
- Excuse me?
- Think about it.

10:25.959 --> 10:30.453
A Chinese man named Miles,
the same name as your baby,

10:30.547 --> 10:32.583
shows up with me from the future.

10:32.674 --> 10:37.043
You really think
this is all coincidence?

10:41.225 --> 10:43.887
- Is this true?
- No.

10:46.480 --> 10:50.723
- Please stay away from me.
- Dr. Chang...

10:51.360 --> 10:53.351
- Dr. Chang, if you...
- Hey, hey!

10:53.445 --> 10:55.561
Are you out of your mind?
What are you doing?

10:55.656 --> 10:58.523
I'm making sure your father
does what he's supposed to do.

10:59.034 --> 11:00.023
And what's that?

11:03.330 --> 11:04.661
You'll see.

11:15.676 --> 11:18.588
Hi, Mom.
I want you to meet Theresa.

11:19.513 --> 11:21.879
- Dan's told me so much...
- Pleased to meet you.

11:21.974 --> 11:24.056
Well done, Daniel.

11:24.768 --> 11:25.928
You must be so proud.

11:26.019 --> 11:30.979
Daniel, I thought we could celebrate
your accomplishment with lunch.

11:31.108 --> 11:34.225
There's a nice restaurant nearby.
l've reserved us a table.

11:35.279 --> 11:36.564
We'd love to.

11:37.406 --> 11:41.775
Actually, I was hoping
it would be just the two of us.

11:42.452 --> 11:47.287
You do understand, don't you?
I don't get to see my son very often.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.992
- Mother...
- I understand. It's OK, Dan, really.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.795
Is there something
bothering you, Daniel?

12:00.470 --> 12:04.930
- You were so rude to Theresa.
- Was I?

12:05.017 --> 12:08.805
- Theresa is my girlfriend.
- She is your research assistant.

12:10.564 --> 12:13.055
You should be focusing
your energies on your work.

12:13.150 --> 12:16.563
- On my work.
- Yes. That is what is important.

12:16.653 --> 12:19.315
Yes, you've made it abundantly clear.

12:19.406 --> 12:22.990
- Why would I waste my gift on a woman?
- I'm sorry to tell you, Daniel,

12:23.076 --> 12:25.909
but you're not going
to have time for relationships.

12:25.996 --> 12:28.988
The women in your life
will only be terribly hurt.

12:31.335 --> 12:32.916
What does that mean?

12:33.003 --> 12:35.915
It means your work
will always come first, that's all.

12:36.006 --> 12:38.372
Only because that's what
you've pushed me to do.

12:38.508 --> 12:42.751
You pushed and pushed.
When will it be enough, Mother?

12:42.846 --> 12:46.054
When? I'm the youngest doctorate
to ever graduate from Oxford.

12:46.183 --> 12:49.175
| just a got a new
1.5 million pound research grant.

12:50.520 --> 12:55.014
- What else do l have to do?
- A grant? That's wonderful.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.268
From whom?

12:57.194 --> 13:00.903
I don't know, Mom. Some industrialist.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.400
Widmore, I think.

13:08.205 --> 13:09.786
Charles Widmore.

13:15.379 --> 13:19.088
I don't want to fight with you, Daniel.
That's not why I came.

13:19.174 --> 13:21.415
Why did you come?

13:28.725 --> 13:30.886
To congratulate you.

13:41.071 --> 13:43.653
Good luck, Daniel.

13:43.740 --> 13:47.324
And I do hope you know
that I mean that.

14:26.867 --> 14:29.825
All right, people... party's over.

14:33.081 --> 14:35.117
I know y'all just showed up,

14:35.208 --> 14:38.325
but the rest of us have been here
for the past three years.

14:38.962 --> 14:42.329
This is our home.
Last thing I wanna do is leave.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.924
But we ain't got no choice.

14:46.011 --> 14:49.128
That dude in the closet,
can't you convince him

14:49.222 --> 14:52.635
- it was all a misunderstanding?
- l punched him in the face, Hugo.

14:52.726 --> 14:55.058
What am I supposed to say?
"My fist slipped?"

14:55.145 --> 14:58.387
How much time do we have
before someone realizes he's gone?

14:58.482 --> 15:02.020
- Not enough.
- So where do we go?

15:04.446 --> 15:07.734
We only got two options.
We can either commandeer the sub,

15:07.824 --> 15:10.201
get off this island
before anyone knows we're gone,

15:11.536 --> 15:14.699
or we can head back in the jungle,
start from square one.

15:16.041 --> 15:19.750
I'm not getting on that sub if there's a
chance my wife is still on this island.

15:19.836 --> 15:22.919
Yeah, me neither.
After all we did to get back here,

15:23.006 --> 15:26.919
now we're just gonna run off again?
Seems kinda wishy-washy.

15:27.010 --> 15:31.003
Right. That's two votes for square one.
Anybody else...?

15:36.520 --> 15:39.136
Hold your horses. Be right there.

15:49.574 --> 15:54.193
- Hey, James.
- Welcome to the meeting, Twitchy.

15:54.913 --> 15:58.326
Good to see you. Pound cake in
the kitchen. Help yourself to the punch.

15:59.209 --> 16:01.791
- He still crazy?
- It's on a whole new level, man.

16:01.878 --> 16:03.618
Great.

16:05.590 --> 16:08.457
Jack, I'm sorry if I was rude before,

16:08.552 --> 16:13.296
but what I came to do is of critical
importance to everyone in this room.

16:14.141 --> 16:17.725
Does anyone know
where I can find the Hostiles?

16:21.565 --> 16:23.726
Why do you need to know that, Daniel?

16:26.611 --> 16:28.943
Because one of them is my mother.

16:32.909 --> 16:35.901
And she is the only person
on this island

16:35.996 --> 16:38.282
who can get us back to where we belong.

16:49.426 --> 16:52.918
This haunting footage comes to us from
the Christiane 1, a salvage vehicle...

16:53.013 --> 16:55.800
- How do you want your eggs?
- For more than two months,

16:55.891 --> 17:00.055
- it's been scouring the depths...
- What? They found that missing plane?

17:00.145 --> 17:02.477
. . . the long-missing
Oceanic Flight 815...

17:02.564 --> 17:06.933
Dan? Dan, why are you so upset?

17:07.569 --> 17:10.652
...verified what the National
Transportation Safety Board...

17:10.739 --> 17:11.899
I don't know.

17:11.990 --> 17:15.198
...which disappeared
after departing Sydney, Australia,

17:15.285 --> 17:17.947
on September 22, 2004.

17:21.416 --> 17:22.952
You have a visitor, Dan.

17:23.793 --> 17:26.785
- Would you like some tea?
- That would be lovely.

17:28.298 --> 17:29.788
Hello, Daniel.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.880
I'm sorry, sir, I don't...

17:38.975 --> 17:44.720
Did Caroline tell ya? I have a condition
that affects my memory...

17:44.814 --> 17:47.066
Don't be embarrassed. We've never met.

17:47.150 --> 17:49.015
My name is Charles Widmore.

17:53.406 --> 17:57.740
Charles Widmore
from my research grants?

17:58.495 --> 18:01.282
It's very nice to meet you, sir.
Please...

18:01.373 --> 18:02.829
...sit down.

18:04.459 --> 18:06.324
A bit of a mess.

18:06.419 --> 18:12.130
I meant to thank you
before I left Oxford...

18:12.217 --> 18:14.583
You mean before you were dismissed.

18:18.765 --> 18:23.509
- I tested that on myself first.
- It's all right, Daniel.

18:23.603 --> 18:27.187
- I would never hurt Theresa...
- Please, it's all right.

18:27.274 --> 18:33.235
That's not why I'm here.
I came to offer you a new opportunity.

18:39.286 --> 18:41.993
No, I... I'm sorry, I can't.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.366
I don't think I can...

18:49.921 --> 18:51.627
Did I say something to upset you?

18:51.715 --> 18:55.082
It's this plane crash.

18:55.218 --> 18:58.756
I don't know
why it's bothering me so much.

18:58.888 --> 19:01.379
It's just so sad...

19:02.475 --> 19:04.386
...they're dead.

19:07.230 --> 19:12.190
Daniel, what if I told you
they're not dead?

19:15.030 --> 19:18.818
What if I told you
the plane was a fake?

19:18.908 --> 19:22.992
An elaborate, expensive fake?

19:25.415 --> 19:27.701
How would you know that?

19:29.002 --> 19:31.584
Because I put it there.

19:39.471 --> 19:41.462
Why would you tell me that?

19:43.433 --> 19:46.846
Because come tomorrow,
you won't remember I did.

19:49.356 --> 19:54.646
Daniel, the real Oceanic Flight 815
crashed on an island,

19:54.778 --> 19:59.693
a special island
with unique scientific properties.

20:01.743 --> 20:04.951
I want to send you to the island.

20:05.997 --> 20:08.739
It will further your research,

20:08.833 --> 20:12.667
show you things you'd never dream of.

20:13.671 --> 20:18.756
And more importantly,
it will heal you, Daniel.

20:18.843 --> 20:23.382
Your mind. Your memory.

20:24.349 --> 20:26.010
Heal me?

20:31.439 --> 20:34.181
Why are you doing all this for me?

20:36.319 --> 20:38.230
You're a man of tremendous gifts

20:38.321 --> 20:41.313
and it would be a shame
to see them go to waste.

20:45.703 --> 20:47.659
You sound like my mother.

20:50.834 --> 20:53.166
That's because we're old friends.

21:01.845 --> 21:04.211
Your mother is an Other?

21:04.305 --> 21:08.093
You met her when the island
was skipping, back in 1954.

21:09.018 --> 21:11.976
- They were calling her Ellie.
- You guys were in 1954?

21:13.189 --> 21:15.521
Like... Fonzie times?

21:15.608 --> 21:18.395
- Why do you need to find her?
- | just need to talk to her.

21:18.486 --> 21:20.442
I thought we were supposed to lay low?

21:20.530 --> 21:23.272
- Just tell me where they are...
- I'm not tellin' you,

21:23.366 --> 21:26.824
and you ain't goin' anywhere unless
you wanna share what you're doing.

21:26.911 --> 21:30.654
Sawyer, he said he can
get us back to where we belong.

21:30.748 --> 21:33.490
Whether we go on the sub
or head back into the jungle...

21:34.502 --> 21:35.617
...we don't belong here.

21:35.712 --> 21:38.920
Well, | belonged herejust fine
until you came back, Doc.

21:44.846 --> 21:46.711
You know where the Hostiles are?

21:48.349 --> 21:51.432
- What?
- You and Sawyer took Ben out to them.

21:51.519 --> 21:54.932
- Can you get us back out there?
- Hold on a second. Don't say a word.

21:55.023 --> 21:57.230
She can say what she wants to say.

21:57.317 --> 22:00.775
Kate, you made me promise
to never ask what happened to Aaron,

22:00.862 --> 22:03.023
or why you came back here.

22:03.114 --> 22:07.528
But I know that reason, it isn't here.
It's not now.

22:08.745 --> 22:12.329
Whatever her reason is, helping
HG. Wells here talk to his mommy

22:12.415 --> 22:13.916
ain't got nothin' to do with it.

22:15.627 --> 22:17.288
Come with us, Freckles.

22:23.259 --> 22:27.047
The code for the fence is 1-4-1-7-1-7.

22:29.140 --> 22:33.725
You should take Daniel.
It's over here for us, anyway.

22:38.358 --> 22:39.848
OK.

22:41.110 --> 22:43.852
- Let's go.
-Gmm.

22:44.822 --> 22:46.358
Great, thank you.

22:46.449 --> 22:48.189
Hey, Miles, can you drive us?

22:59.629 --> 23:02.541
When you realize
you've made a huge mistake,

23:02.632 --> 23:06.045
we'll be back at the beach.
Right where we started.

23:11.891 --> 23:14.553
All right, the rest of us...
pack anything you can carry,

23:14.644 --> 23:16.475
meet back here in 20 minutes.

23:22.443 --> 23:24.149
Time to go.

23:31.494 --> 23:33.906
These people
are not gonna be happy to see us.

23:33.997 --> 23:36.409
Might be a good idea to bring some guns.

23:36.499 --> 23:38.990
There's a gun safe
in the motor pool, but it's locked.

23:40.461 --> 23:42.167
Good thing I'm a janitor, then.

23:43.506 --> 23:44.666
Hey, Dan?

23:45.675 --> 23:48.758
I'll meet you at the motor pool.
I need just a minute, OK?

24:09.949 --> 24:13.407
I'm not allowed to have
chocolate before dinner.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.538
It's OK, sweetheart.

24:20.710 --> 24:22.200
I won't tell.

24:25.715 --> 24:28.878
My name's Charlotte. What's yours?

24:30.595 --> 24:34.429
l'm Daniel. I'm new here.

24:38.061 --> 24:42.725
Listen...
Do you know Dr. Chang?

24:42.815 --> 24:43.895
Yeah?

24:45.151 --> 24:50.612
Hopefully really soon, Dr. Chang
is gonna ask a bunch of people

24:50.698 --> 24:54.236
to get on the submarine
and leave the island.

24:55.244 --> 24:58.702
When he does, you and your mommy...

24:58.790 --> 25:00.826
...you're gonna have to leave.

25:01.417 --> 25:03.794
In case what I do doesn't work,

25:04.754 --> 25:08.212
you cannot be here.
You have to leave.

25:11.969 --> 25:15.882
I tried to avoid telling you this.
I didn't think I could change things.

25:19.394 --> 25:21.180
But maybe I can.

25:34.117 --> 25:35.948
How long will it take us to get there?

25:36.035 --> 25:38.492
We can take the road
until we hit the pylons,

25:38.579 --> 25:40.706
but in their territory,
we gotta go on foot.

25:41.958 --> 25:43.698
You have something for a beginner?

25:49.298 --> 25:50.333
Let's go.

25:53.428 --> 25:55.293
That's ready to go.

25:55.388 --> 25:57.253
What's going on here?

25:59.142 --> 26:01.349
Aren't you one of the physicists
off the sub?

26:01.436 --> 26:04.519
Yeah, that's right. We were just...

26:04.605 --> 26:06.391
You're supposed to be at the Swan site.

26:08.776 --> 26:13.190
Right. There was an accident
at the Orchid station.

26:13.281 --> 26:15.647
- Dr. Chang asked us to help...
- He's got a gun!

26:16.659 --> 26:20.698
ljust left Dr. Chang. He's at home
with his wife and baby. You're lying.

26:20.830 --> 26:23.822
Now drop the guns
and get down on the ground!

26:23.916 --> 26:27.408
Listen to me. You really
do not understand what's happening.

26:27.503 --> 26:31.337
You have no idea. We have no time.
We have to leave. All right?

26:31.758 --> 26:34.374
We're just gonna leave, OK? Nobody's...

26:44.270 --> 26:45.726
Are you OK?

26:53.154 --> 26:54.564
We can make it to the jeep.

26:55.406 --> 26:58.898
All right. l'll cover you.
Dan? You go, too. All right?

26:58.993 --> 27:00.278
Go, go, go!

27:32.652 --> 27:34.608
Sound the alarm!

28:04.725 --> 28:06.306
Hello, Daniel.

28:06.978 --> 28:08.764
Mother.

28:10.064 --> 28:11.600
When did you get here?

28:11.691 --> 28:14.728
| just arrived.
I would've called you, but...

28:15.361 --> 28:17.693
I would've forgotten anyway.

28:20.533 --> 28:23.650
I hear you have been offered a job.

28:25.580 --> 28:29.619
- How do you know that?
- It's my business to know.

28:31.252 --> 28:33.368
I came here, Daniel,

28:33.462 --> 28:38.081
to tell you that it is very important
that you say "yes" to Mr. Widmore.

28:39.719 --> 28:43.337
That you accept this opportunity.

28:45.558 --> 28:47.094
I can't.

28:49.478 --> 28:54.643
He needs someone who can do
really complex space-time calibrations

28:54.734 --> 29:00.730
and calculate bearings, and ljust...
I don't know how to do that anymore.

29:00.823 --> 29:01.812
Daniel...

29:02.575 --> 29:06.488
This place he mentioned to you,
this island...

29:07.872 --> 29:11.330
...did he tell you
that it could make you better?

29:16.255 --> 29:21.545
What if it's true?
Then you could go on with your work.

29:21.636 --> 29:25.174
Just think of all you could accomplish.

29:27.391 --> 29:30.599
You really want me to go?

29:32.647 --> 29:34.137
Yes.

29:39.695 --> 29:41.356
Will it make you proud of me?

29:46.911 --> 29:50.449
Yes, Daniel. ltwill.

30:01.008 --> 30:02.339
Then I'll do it.

30:19.944 --> 30:22.435
- You remember the code?
- Yeah, I got it.

30:23.239 --> 30:24.900
I'm gonna take a look at that.

30:26.909 --> 30:29.776
Yeah, good. It's just a graze.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.621
- This is gonna sting.
- Yeah.

30:37.753 --> 30:39.459
Yeah, you're gonna be fine.

30:40.631 --> 30:41.837
Guess I'm lucky.

30:43.259 --> 30:46.797
What's luck have to do with it?
Thought whatever happened, happened?

30:46.887 --> 30:50.596
You gotta understand, Jack,
this is our present.

30:50.683 --> 30:52.674
When we met,
did I have a scar on my neck?

30:53.728 --> 30:57.516
No. Because I hadn't been shot yet.

30:57.606 --> 31:00.598
We can't be so naive
as to think nothing can happen to us.

31:03.612 --> 31:06.274
Any one of us can die, Jack.

31:06.365 --> 31:09.607
OK, it's off.

31:11.245 --> 31:12.234
Thanks.

31:16.333 --> 31:19.746
- Which way?
- Just a couple miles in.

31:28.262 --> 31:29.968
You think he knows what he's doing?

31:30.973 --> 31:35.387
Sure hope so.
There's no turning back now.

31:42.026 --> 31:44.733
You called it the minute
those yahoos got here.

31:44.820 --> 31:46.151
I should've listened to you.

31:47.823 --> 31:51.657
- You can say, "I told you so."
- Maybe after we get to the beach.

31:52.328 --> 31:53.909
Hey...

31:54.997 --> 31:56.953
You still got my back?

31:59.835 --> 32:01.575
You still got mine?

32:14.767 --> 32:16.303
That's not good, right?

32:21.982 --> 32:23.597
LaFleur!

32:25.486 --> 32:28.444
- Where have you been?
- Take it easy, Stu.

32:28.531 --> 32:31.739
- What the hell's going on?
- | just got shot by a physicist

32:31.826 --> 32:35.785
and the new recruits are helping him.
We've been infiltrated.

32:35.871 --> 32:40.160
That's ridiculous. Nowjust calm down
and we can talk about this.

32:42.253 --> 32:45.040
- What was that?
- Sounded like it was from outside.

33:02.106 --> 33:04.313
Get down on the ground, now.

33:05.985 --> 33:08.021
I said now!

33:29.550 --> 33:30.881
Thank you.

33:33.262 --> 33:35.423
You need a gun
to go talk to your mother, Dan?

33:38.058 --> 33:40.049
You don't know my mother, Jack.

33:43.564 --> 33:45.475
You ready to tell me why she was wrong?

33:45.566 --> 33:47.557
Why we don't belong here?

33:57.661 --> 34:02.701
In about four hours,
the Dharma folks at the Swan worksite,

34:02.791 --> 34:05.658
they're gonna drill into the ground

34:05.753 --> 34:08.119
and accidentally tap
a massive pocket of energy.

34:09.298 --> 34:14.133
The result of the release
of this energy will be catastrophic.

34:14.220 --> 34:17.712
So, in order to contain it,
they're gonna cement the entire area in,

34:17.806 --> 34:18.795
like Chernobyl.

34:20.726 --> 34:26.221
And this place they built over it?
I believe you called it "the hatch."

34:27.483 --> 34:28.814
The Swan hatch.

34:31.153 --> 34:35.567
Because of this one accident,

34:35.658 --> 34:38.525
these people are gonna spend
the next 20 years

34:38.619 --> 34:43.409
keeping that energy at bay
by pressing a button.

34:45.000 --> 34:50.085
A button that your friend Desmond
will one day fail to push.

34:51.298 --> 34:56.008
And that will cause your plane,
Oceanic 815...

34:56.720 --> 34:58.051
...to crash on this island.

34:59.181 --> 35:02.548
And because your plane crashed,
a freighter will be sent to this island.

35:02.643 --> 35:05.385
A freighter l was on,
and Charlotte was on, and so forth.

35:05.479 --> 35:10.473
This entire chain of events is
gonna start happening this afternoon.

35:12.194 --> 35:16.187
But, we can change that.

35:16.282 --> 35:19.365
l've studied relativistic physics
my entire life.

35:19.451 --> 35:24.036
One thing emerged, over and over.
You can't change the past. Can't do it.

35:24.123 --> 35:27.035
Whatever happened, happened.

35:28.127 --> 35:31.665
But then, I finally realized...

35:31.755 --> 35:36.749
I had been spending so much time
focused on the constants

35:36.844 --> 35:38.675
| forgot about the variables.

35:40.222 --> 35:42.634
Know what the variables
in these equations are?

35:44.059 --> 35:46.311
- No.
- Us.

35:46.937 --> 35:49.644
We're the variables. People.

35:49.732 --> 35:54.066
We think, we reason,
we make choices, we have free will.

35:54.153 --> 35:56.986
We can change our destiny.

36:00.534 --> 36:04.994
I think I can negate that energy
under the Swan.

36:05.080 --> 36:06.536
I think I can destroy it.

36:07.416 --> 36:11.375
lfl can, then that hatch
will never be built,

36:11.462 --> 36:15.125
and your plane,
your plane will land

36:15.215 --> 36:17.547
just like it's supposed to,

36:17.634 --> 36:19.420
in Los Angeles.

36:25.059 --> 36:28.847
And just how exactly
do you plan on destroying this energy?

36:31.857 --> 36:34.394
I'm gonna detonate a hydrogen bomb.

36:49.792 --> 36:54.456
Daniel Faraday?
Your son is Daniel Faraday?

36:55.631 --> 36:56.962
Yes.

36:57.049 --> 37:01.088
That's the man who sent Desmond
to Los Angeles to find you?

37:01.178 --> 37:02.964
That's right.

37:03.055 --> 37:07.048
I came, Penelope, to apologize.

37:07.142 --> 37:10.885
Your husband has become a casualty

37:11.397 --> 37:14.855
in a conflict that's bigger than him,
bigger than any of us.

37:14.942 --> 37:16.807
What do you mean?
ls Des going to be OK?

37:17.528 --> 37:19.189
I don't know.

37:20.197 --> 37:22.483
For the first time in a long time,

37:23.158 --> 37:26.025
I don't know
what's going to happen next.

37:27.996 --> 37:29.657
- Mrs. Hume?
- Yes?

37:29.748 --> 37:32.911
Your husband's in the recovery room
and he's asking for you.

37:33.001 --> 37:35.413
- The recovery room?
- He's doing fine.

37:35.504 --> 37:38.291
Come with me.
This nurse will watch your son.

37:52.646 --> 37:53.931
Hi.

37:56.442 --> 37:57.727
Hi.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.939
I thought I'd lost you.

38:06.034 --> 38:07.865
I promised you, Penny.

38:09.371 --> 38:11.111
I promised you...

38:14.460 --> 38:16.746
...l'd never leave you again.

38:33.562 --> 38:34.802
Is he all right?

38:38.817 --> 38:42.480
Yes, Charles. He's fine.

38:43.906 --> 38:45.396
Good.

38:46.408 --> 38:50.151
Your daughter's in there.
Why don't you go in and say hello?

38:50.245 --> 38:53.783
Unfortunately, Eloise,
my relationship with Penelope

38:53.874 --> 38:55.990
is one of the things I had to sacrifice.

38:56.960 --> 38:58.791
Sacrifice?

38:58.879 --> 39:02.747
Don't you talk to me
about sacrifice, Charles.

39:02.841 --> 39:06.379
I had to send my son back
to the island, knowing full well...

39:06.470 --> 39:08.301
He was my son too, Eloise.

39:31.370 --> 39:32.655
This is a mistake.

39:33.872 --> 39:37.330
He's talking about erasing
everything that's ever happened to us.

39:37.417 --> 39:38.873
ltsinsane.

39:38.961 --> 39:42.795
We disappeared off a plane
in midair and ended up in 1977.

39:42.881 --> 39:44.837
I'm getting kinda used to insane.

40:03.610 --> 40:04.725
Wish me luck.

40:04.820 --> 40:07.027
- Wait...
- Let him go.

40:26.675 --> 40:29.542
Back up. Step away. It's OK.

40:29.678 --> 40:33.546
Nobody move!
I only want to speak to Eloise.

40:35.684 --> 40:37.675
Where is Eloise?

40:38.020 --> 40:39.931
Come on, where is she?

40:40.022 --> 40:41.228
I'm sorry, but...

40:43.609 --> 40:45.520
She's not here right now.

40:49.364 --> 40:50.774
Do we know each other?

40:52.326 --> 40:55.784
It doesn't matter.
I need you to take me to Eloise.

40:55.871 --> 40:57.782
I already told you, she's not here.

40:57.873 --> 40:59.283
Where's the bomb, Richard?

41:00.542 --> 41:03.158
The hydrogen bomb
I told you to bury. Where is it?

41:04.713 --> 41:08.547
Listen to me. Lower your gun and
we'll talk. Nobody has to get hurt here.

41:08.634 --> 41:11.592
- Just put the gun down.
- I'm gonna give you three seconds.

41:13.138 --> 41:15.129
- One...
- Don't do this.

41:15.223 --> 41:16.383
Two!

41:30.030 --> 41:32.021
- Why did you do that?
- He had a gun on you.

41:32.115 --> 41:33.616
He wasn't gonna shoot, Eloise.

41:36.620 --> 41:37.985
Eloise?

41:42.834 --> 41:44.825
You knew.

41:46.129 --> 41:48.085
You always knew.

41:49.925 --> 41:53.918
You knew this was gonna happen...

41:54.763 --> 41:57.596
...and you sent me here anyway.

41:59.685 --> 42:01.801
Who are you?

42:05.607 --> 42:07.768
I'm your son.
