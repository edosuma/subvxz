01:45.864 --> 01:46.692
Maise,

01:52.008 --> 01:52.802
I'm here.

02:13.581 --> 02:14.410
Raymond?

02:15.376 --> 02:17.378
We waited as long as we could.

03:31.418 --> 03:33.937
Lawrence, let's
let your daddy sleep.

03:53.094 --> 03:55.200
Oh, how are the things?

04:07.592 --> 04:12.390
The coroner arranged for
transport, can meet us up there.

04:16.911 --> 04:17.774
I'm taking her.

04:25.368 --> 04:28.623
Okay, alright, well,

04:28.647 --> 04:29.821
we'll meet ya up there.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.976
How's the mountain air, buddy?

05:23.184 --> 05:24.955
I always talked about
bringing you up here,

05:24.979 --> 05:28.362
but Mama didn't think
it was worth shit.

06:42.954 --> 06:44.241
They own the defense, offense,

06:44.265 --> 06:45.726
everything, it's unbelievable...

07:14.019 --> 07:15.745
I'll give you time.

07:21.751 --> 07:25.445
What a play to the left.

07:31.727 --> 07:32.555
Daddy?

07:34.868 --> 07:37.260
It's alright, buddy,
it's just Pastor Hirsch.

07:37.284 --> 07:39.124
Marty.
Raymond.

07:39.148 --> 07:40.390
Good to see you, Raymond.

07:41.909 --> 07:42.945
Glad I caught ya.

07:44.394 --> 07:45.188
Hello, there.

07:46.189 --> 07:47.190
How ya doin', buddy?

07:48.640 --> 07:49.686
Daddy?
Hey,

07:49.710 --> 07:52.275
stop it.

07:52.299 --> 07:53.621
I'm sorry.
No, no, no, no, no

07:53.645 --> 07:55.613
it's just gonna
take him some time.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.307
I don't want you to
worry about anything.

08:01.342 --> 08:02.758
She's in good hands, Raymond.

08:04.207 --> 08:06.013
We got her the plots that are
right next to your parents.

08:06.037 --> 08:08.774
I know you're going through
a troubled time right now,

08:08.798 --> 08:11.052
but I want you to
know that I'm here.

08:11.076 --> 08:12.571
So is the Lord.

08:12.595 --> 08:14.815
If you ever wanna talk to
me, my door's always open.

08:16.116 --> 08:17.611
It's a drive, bringing
here back here, Raymond.

08:17.635 --> 08:18.853
Hey, look, that's enough.

08:18.877 --> 08:19.706
Just sit still.

08:23.364 --> 08:25.170
Thanks, Marty.
Yeah, sure.

08:25.194 --> 08:27.437
I gotta get going.
Okay.

08:34.652 --> 08:36.722
Ew, gross, Mommy.

08:45.973 --> 08:47.837
Hey, Lawrence, come on.

08:49.598 --> 08:50.460
Look at me.

08:53.118 --> 08:54.855
With people like that,

08:54.879 --> 08:58.375
they're gonna spend their whole
lives trying to be original.

08:58.399 --> 09:00.401
You, you're lucky
enough to be born one.

09:04.820 --> 09:07.167
Just get yourself some chips.

09:16.314 --> 09:18.109
Just don't look
at him, baby girl.

09:35.885 --> 09:37.611
Mommy!
Oh, my God.

10:16.063 --> 10:18.973
Where are we?

10:18.997 --> 10:20.896
This is Nana and Papa's house.

10:21.897 --> 10:23.657
It's where I grew up.

11:57.855 --> 11:58.683
Ray.

12:02.652 --> 12:03.446
Hey.

12:05.863 --> 12:06.656
Oh.

12:09.763 --> 12:10.799
I'm so sorry.

12:11.972 --> 12:14.813
I don't understand,
what the fuck happened?

12:14.837 --> 12:16.563
Truck just came out of nowhere.

12:20.049 --> 12:21.395
Just the middle of the day.

12:23.397 --> 12:24.295
A regular day.

12:28.057 --> 12:29.610
I got me the first flight back.

12:32.061 --> 12:32.924
Oh, my God.

12:35.962 --> 12:37.249
Officer Marrow.

12:42.831 --> 12:43.659
Hey.

12:45.730 --> 12:47.501
Hi, Lawrence.

12:47.525 --> 12:49.561
That's right, I'm
Officer Marrow.

12:51.356 --> 12:52.806
This is your Aunt Caroline.

12:55.119 --> 12:56.579
Say hi.

12:56.603 --> 12:57.397
You're nice.

13:07.752 --> 13:09.374
Nice to finally meet you.

13:14.586 --> 13:16.796
Ooh, he's precocious.

13:19.453 --> 13:20.351
I just...

13:25.252 --> 13:27.127
I don't know what
the fuck I'm doin'.

13:27.151 --> 13:29.336
You know what, you're here.

13:29.360 --> 13:30.958
Why don't we just start simple,

13:30.982 --> 13:33.374
and go grab some
take-out from Coney,

13:33.398 --> 13:35.549
and we'll teach him
how to play rummy.

13:35.573 --> 13:36.574
How does that sound?

13:40.716 --> 13:41.544
Okay.

13:44.513 --> 13:47.067
Well, I'll come by first
thing in the morning.

13:50.001 --> 13:51.220
You're here now, right?

13:51.244 --> 13:53.108
You better get used
to seeing my face.

13:54.316 --> 13:57.053
Are you gonna stay here
or with Amanda and Burg?

13:57.077 --> 13:59.193
No, we're gonna stay here.

13:59.217 --> 14:00.046
Alright.

14:01.150 --> 14:02.541
Okay.

14:02.565 --> 14:03.359
Alright, then.

14:07.881 --> 14:08.709
Alright.

14:27.797 --> 14:29.316
It's time to go to sleep now.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.611
Are we gonna
put Mommy in the ground?

14:40.431 --> 14:41.915
That's enough now, Lawrence.

14:43.468 --> 14:44.687
Time to go to sleep.

14:44.711 --> 14:45.539
You're tired.

14:46.989 --> 14:49.347
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.

14:49.371 --> 14:51.891
Now I'm gonna be sleeping
right here next to you.

14:53.409 --> 14:54.238
Go to sleep.

15:22.093 --> 15:24.589
Have I ever let you down?

15:27.374 --> 15:28.444
If we do this,

15:30.136 --> 15:31.102
you gotta deliver,

15:32.069 --> 15:33.104
'cause if you don't,

15:34.243 --> 15:35.762
Denver's gonna wipe
us off the map.

15:40.422 --> 15:42.676
Hello, Shelly.

15:42.700 --> 15:44.678
Two well and a cup.

15:44.702 --> 15:45.530
Mm-hmm.

15:52.089 --> 15:53.193
Fuck Colorado.

15:54.608 --> 15:56.517
We make one call, first truck's
on the road in five minutes.

15:56.541 --> 15:58.336
Don't make me the
bad guy, Bernie.

15:59.199 --> 16:00.614
And that's a yes?

16:02.616 --> 16:03.686
Yeah.

16:29.885 --> 16:31.438
Who's your friend?

16:33.199 --> 16:34.959
Oh, we met on social media.

16:45.073 --> 16:46.395
Can I help you with
something, Bernie?

16:46.419 --> 16:48.007
I heard Ray's back in town.

16:51.355 --> 16:52.183
That's right.

16:54.116 --> 16:55.645
And I heard Maise Connely

16:55.669 --> 16:58.017
met her maker in the
form of an F-150.

17:03.574 --> 17:04.689
I figured somebody who knows

17:04.713 --> 17:06.346
how hard it is to lose somebody

17:06.369 --> 17:08.199
would be a little
bit more empathetic.

17:11.892 --> 17:13.515
You don't talk about her.

18:15.439 --> 18:17.072
How you doin', bud?

18:21.065 --> 18:21.893
Lawrence?

18:22.860 --> 18:24.355
I look pretty, Daddy.

18:24.379 --> 18:26.253
Jesus Christ,
what are you doing?

18:26.277 --> 18:27.554
You don't do that.

18:29.038 --> 18:30.947
Here.

18:30.971 --> 18:32.870
Why am I a boy this time, Daddy?

18:34.078 --> 18:35.942
Because your mom and
I asked for you, bud.

18:43.363 --> 18:45.538
I don't wanna yell at you.

18:46.677 --> 18:48.230
I'm here, okay?

18:51.199 --> 18:52.200
Do you here me, bud?

18:56.204 --> 18:57.274
Let's get you dressed.

18:59.103 --> 19:00.770
Is Mama gonna be at the party?

19:00.794 --> 19:04.971
Yeah.

20:47.315 --> 20:49.983
When the dust
returns into the ground

20:50.007 --> 20:51.008
from which it came,

20:52.078 --> 20:53.700
and the spirit returns to God.

20:56.116 --> 20:58.257
Maise was a daughter
of this community

20:59.982 --> 21:03.745
and a wife and a mother.

21:06.610 --> 21:07.794
And we all remember

21:07.818 --> 21:09.313
Daddy?
What we love about Maise,

21:09.337 --> 21:11.304
and take that love
with us everyday.

21:12.616 --> 21:13.558
Dad?

21:13.582 --> 21:15.204
We should all remember to keep

21:16.689 --> 21:20.013
what we love about Maise
close to our hearts.

21:20.037 --> 21:21.601
Daddy?
And in that way,

21:21.625 --> 21:22.740
Look, that's enough.
Her spirit lives

21:22.764 --> 21:23.568
I'm sorry.
Through us.

21:23.592 --> 21:24.535
What are doing? No.

21:24.559 --> 21:25.846
No, Daddy, no.

21:25.870 --> 21:26.882
Stop it, I don't
even know what you,

21:26.906 --> 21:27.814
you're out of line.

21:27.838 --> 21:29.643
Come here.
No, no, no.

21:29.667 --> 21:30.782
No, Daddy.
Stop it.

21:30.806 --> 21:32.301
No, Daddy, stop it.

21:32.325 --> 21:33.923
Stop.

21:33.947 --> 21:35.718
Lawrence, just shut the, stop.

21:35.742 --> 21:37.168
No.
Stop moving, stop it.

21:37.192 --> 21:40.620
Get away from me.
Hey, that's enough.

21:40.644 --> 21:42.311
Yeah, we're fine, thanks.

21:42.335 --> 21:43.554
Stop.
Get up.

21:43.578 --> 21:45.614
That Maise has
gone to a better place.

21:47.064 --> 21:49.974
And the Lord welcomes her.

21:52.069 --> 21:53.484
And she is also here with us.

22:22.271 --> 22:24.042
You can't expect
him to be all sunshine.

22:24.066 --> 22:25.482
I can barely hold him down.

22:26.586 --> 22:28.599
You know, pediatrics
over in Sunbury,

22:28.623 --> 22:29.762
they have some...

22:31.626 --> 22:33.213
Let me go talk to 'em.

22:34.422 --> 22:36.538
He's not seeing
a fuckin' shrink.

22:36.562 --> 22:38.954
All's I'm saying is
that if he needs help...

22:38.978 --> 22:41.370
Ray, what do you
want us to do here?

22:41.394 --> 22:42.775
I don't fuckin' know.

22:44.432 --> 22:47.193
Well, let's see how
he's doing when he wakes up.

22:53.130 --> 22:55.936
Just one
more thing for the people

22:55.960 --> 22:57.697
to talk about in this town.

22:57.721 --> 23:00.413
I just thought he'd have a
chance at something normal.

23:03.209 --> 23:04.555
But I guess it don't matter.

23:06.177 --> 23:07.569
'Cause this shit
is just as random

23:07.593 --> 23:09.422
as an IED on a 10 year old.

23:11.044 --> 23:13.160
Don't bring that Eckhart
Tolle shit back here

23:13.184 --> 23:15.542
after everything
you saw over there.

23:15.566 --> 23:17.199
You don't get to tell
me it doesn't matter.

23:17.223 --> 23:18.373
It does matter.

23:18.397 --> 23:19.270
You matter.

23:19.294 --> 23:20.399
Lawrence matters.

23:22.297 --> 23:23.792
And I'm sorry about
what happened to Maise,

23:23.816 --> 23:25.725
and I'm sorry that you
had to come back here

23:25.749 --> 23:27.899
with your family
but you need us.

23:27.923 --> 23:29.867
And we need you,
Lawrence needs you.

23:29.891 --> 23:31.524
So you can cry and
you can be sad,

23:31.548 --> 23:33.308
but you damn well
better be strong.

23:39.107 --> 23:40.419
She's still with you.

23:42.041 --> 23:43.846
She's with you in him.

23:43.870 --> 23:44.699
Everyday.

24:01.854 --> 24:02.648
There now.

24:04.373 --> 24:05.167
That's good.

24:06.617 --> 24:08.308
You're gonna be just fine.

24:10.276 --> 24:12.081
Are you then one
makin' all that racket

24:12.105 --> 24:13.876
at the service, huh?

24:13.900 --> 24:15.637
Lawrence, this is...

24:15.661 --> 24:16.845
Nana.

24:16.869 --> 24:20.148
Norma, this is Norma
Coleman, Lawrence.

24:21.080 --> 24:22.322
July's Nana.

24:23.392 --> 24:24.749
What?

24:24.773 --> 24:26.061
Lawrence?

24:26.085 --> 24:27.338
July Rain's Nana.

24:30.330 --> 24:31.987
You son of a bitch.

24:32.850 --> 24:34.449
Norma?

24:34.473 --> 24:35.439
Now just hold on.

24:57.806 --> 24:58.911
What's goin' on?

25:02.742 --> 25:05.825
Tell your father what
you just said, Lawrence.

25:05.849 --> 25:06.850
It's okay, buddy.

25:09.577 --> 25:10.439
What did you say?

25:11.579 --> 25:12.441
July Rain.

25:15.065 --> 25:17.043
Ah, here, I'll take him.

25:17.067 --> 25:17.895
Come on, bud.

25:26.559 --> 25:27.743
What?

25:27.767 --> 25:29.952
Have you been talking
to him about anything?

25:29.976 --> 25:31.575
I told you that
he's been saying shit

25:31.599 --> 25:33.473
since we got up here.

25:33.497 --> 25:34.888
It's not normal, I know it.

25:34.912 --> 25:36.856
You know, Maybe Maise
was telling you things

25:36.880 --> 25:38.720
that were goin' on up here
while you were deployed?

25:38.744 --> 25:41.757
Maise fucking hated it up here.

25:41.781 --> 25:43.690
That's the whole reason we left.

25:43.714 --> 25:46.037
July Rain Coleman is
Bernie Coleman's daughter.

25:46.061 --> 25:48.857
Remember you and Maise left
town when she was a toddler?

25:49.789 --> 25:51.905
Ah, yeah, okay.

25:51.929 --> 25:53.251
Well, maybe she
was at the funeral?

25:53.275 --> 25:55.070
Mm, that's not possible.

25:57.417 --> 25:58.947
July's case is a cold case.

25:58.971 --> 26:00.327
She's been missing.

26:00.351 --> 26:01.605
She was 15.

26:01.629 --> 26:03.607
No one would dare talk about it.

26:03.631 --> 26:06.541
Lawrence saying it to
Norma, it's beyond rude,

26:06.565 --> 26:07.921
it's downright dangerous.

26:07.945 --> 26:09.923
Well, somebody said somethin'.

26:09.947 --> 26:12.098
Look, you know
how things are here.

26:12.122 --> 26:13.720
Answers don't always
have to be true

26:13.744 --> 26:15.342
as long as they're believable.

26:15.366 --> 26:17.413
So you talk to him or
you don't talk to him,

26:17.437 --> 26:20.244
but you gotta come
up with somethin'.

26:44.464 --> 26:46.535
Alright now, stop playing
with your food, buddy.

26:47.916 --> 26:48.928
Do you wanna talk to me about

26:48.952 --> 26:50.470
what you said to Miss Coleman?

26:54.889 --> 26:56.763
Did your mama maybe
say some things to you

26:56.787 --> 26:58.869
about up here while I was gone?

26:58.893 --> 26:59.894
About July Rain?

27:01.033 --> 27:02.769
July Rain?

27:02.793 --> 27:04.806
Yeah, that's right, July Rain.

27:04.830 --> 27:06.314
Little girl from around here.

27:09.455 --> 27:11.940
Do you remember talking
about her to Miss Coleman?

27:15.254 --> 27:16.911
Did somebody say
her name to you?

27:18.326 --> 27:20.121
Maybe somebody said
it at the house?

27:26.783 --> 27:29.554
Alright Lawrence, look,
it's really important, okay?

27:29.578 --> 27:31.487
You really hurt some people's
feelings when you said that,

27:31.511 --> 27:32.523
and these aren't
the type of people

27:32.547 --> 27:33.755
that we wanna be hurtin'.

27:35.239 --> 27:37.552
I really need you to try and
remember where you heard it.

27:39.554 --> 27:40.969
I didn't hear it, Daddy.

27:49.909 --> 27:50.738
Lawrence...

27:56.502 --> 27:58.342
Alright, you're done.

27:58.366 --> 27:59.895
I'm not done.
Yeah, you are.

27:59.919 --> 28:01.828
Look, I don't know
who taught you to lie,

28:01.852 --> 28:04.072
but you don't do
that shit with me.

28:04.096 --> 28:05.407
Get this.

28:06.719 --> 28:07.489
C'mon.

28:26.566 --> 28:28.303
So, where's your
boy, Ray Marrow?

28:28.327 --> 28:29.545
Bernie.

28:29.569 --> 28:30.754
Figured you'd
have been gone by now?

28:30.778 --> 28:32.365
Yeah, you're good right there.

28:34.367 --> 28:36.518
My condolences about Maise.

28:36.542 --> 28:38.278
I appreciate that.

28:38.302 --> 28:40.166
Some people might
say you bad luck.

28:41.650 --> 28:44.653
But I guess that reaper, he
follows all of us, don't he?

28:46.276 --> 28:48.554
Norma says your
boy's quite a talker.

28:49.797 --> 28:50.625
Yep.

28:52.040 --> 28:53.431
You know how kids can be.

28:53.455 --> 28:54.284
Yes, I do.

28:55.388 --> 28:56.217
At least I did.

29:00.393 --> 29:01.498
Spit it out, Bernie.

29:02.706 --> 29:04.570
When my baby girl
first went missing,

29:05.882 --> 29:07.204
whole town was
bells and whistles

29:07.228 --> 29:09.378
out lookin' for her for weeks.

29:09.402 --> 29:10.231
For weeks.

29:12.129 --> 29:14.314
You know, these people up here,

29:14.338 --> 29:19.033
they, they got their
faith until they don't.

29:22.070 --> 29:24.763
They went from scouring
the end's of the Earth

29:25.764 --> 29:26.937
to just droppin' it.

29:28.732 --> 29:30.020
And no one even dared so much

29:30.044 --> 29:32.505
as mention her name
again after that.

29:32.529 --> 29:33.357
Until today.

29:36.326 --> 29:37.465
Well, somebody did.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.364
And that's where he heard it.

29:43.160 --> 29:44.610
He didn't say nothin' else?

29:53.067 --> 29:55.977
Look, Bernie, I am
sorry about your daughter,

29:56.001 --> 29:58.106
but we're talking about
a little boy here.

30:00.143 --> 30:00.971
Yeah.

30:02.179 --> 30:04.502
Well, you have a safe
trip back to the city.

30:35.040 --> 30:36.869
Do you like it here?

30:40.700 --> 30:41.701
I remember it.

30:43.703 --> 30:44.946
You remember what?

30:46.258 --> 30:47.362
Playing in the woods.

30:48.985 --> 30:51.204
Yeah, you mean earlier?

30:51.228 --> 30:52.712
I used to play in the woods.

30:59.374 --> 31:00.869
I think you're tired, bud.

31:00.893 --> 31:02.067
Let's get you outta here.

31:56.949 --> 31:58.996
I pulled up into the
parking lot at Coney's

31:59.020 --> 32:01.585
the other night, it was a
beautiful night, twilight.

32:01.609 --> 32:02.817
Sun had just set.

32:03.818 --> 32:06.579
And saw this remarkable vision.

32:07.753 --> 32:10.387
Really, you could see
everybody's face inside

32:10.411 --> 32:11.836
at the booths,

32:11.860 --> 32:14.736
and they all looked like
they were perfectly at peace,

32:14.760 --> 32:16.496
and strangely they were
lit from underneath.

32:16.520 --> 32:17.532
Stop what you're
doing right now.

32:17.556 --> 32:19.948
It was like a beatific vision.

32:21.594 --> 32:24.263
So I walked up the steps
and I walked inside

32:24.287 --> 32:26.299
and saw everybody was
on their cellphone.

32:28.291 --> 32:33.296
Everybody was connected to what?

32:35.263 --> 32:39.347
We live in such a
difficult time to,

32:39.371 --> 32:42.029
it's, I call it the
disease of separateness.

32:44.479 --> 32:47.010
Which is why it's so wonderful
that we're here today,

32:47.034 --> 32:51.773
and every Sunday to
bear witness together,

32:51.797 --> 32:54.317
to have fellowship
in Jesus' name.

32:57.354 --> 32:59.356
And what we fight
on a daily basis,

33:00.944 --> 33:02.957
what we struggle
is the separateness

33:02.981 --> 33:04.959
because when you
separate, you are alone,

33:04.983 --> 33:08.410
and when you are alone,
you are removing yourself

33:08.434 --> 33:10.757
from your fellow man.

33:10.781 --> 33:12.852
Your brothers, your sisters.

33:13.888 --> 33:16.339
And it's easy to fall.

33:28.144 --> 33:29.145
Sunbury.

33:34.253 --> 33:35.082
That's right.

33:37.360 --> 33:38.223
Hey, listen, bud.

33:40.328 --> 33:43.193
Do you remember what you
said during Mama's party?

33:46.645 --> 33:47.473
Easy buddy.

33:52.133 --> 33:53.376
St. Luther's.

33:57.311 --> 33:59.692
How did you know the name
of that church, Lawrence?

34:02.109 --> 34:03.707
I was there.

34:03.731 --> 34:05.674
And when was this, Lawrence?

34:05.698 --> 34:06.734
At July's communion.

34:13.085 --> 34:16.513
Two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

34:16.536 --> 34:20.344
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

34:20.368 --> 34:22.760
One, two, three,
four, five, six...

34:22.784 --> 34:24.614
When were you
with July, Lawrence?

34:25.476 --> 34:26.304
Before.

34:27.375 --> 34:28.376
Before when, bud?

34:29.722 --> 34:32.184
Five, six, seven, eight.

34:32.208 --> 34:36.842
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

34:36.867 --> 34:40.768
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

34:41.940 --> 34:46.266
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

34:46.291 --> 34:51.237
One, two, three, again.

34:54.678 --> 34:55.507
Hey.

34:57.129 --> 34:59.314
Five, six, seven, eight.

34:59.338 --> 35:03.629
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

35:03.653 --> 35:07.426
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

35:07.450 --> 35:11.292
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

35:11.316 --> 35:15.261
One, two three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

35:21.981 --> 35:23.062
Ask him something.

35:23.086 --> 35:25.468
Lawrence, hey, honey.

35:26.469 --> 35:28.126
You like it up here, huh?

35:31.129 --> 35:33.683
Do you see that lady over
there behind the counter?

35:36.030 --> 35:37.663
What do you think her name is?

35:37.687 --> 35:38.515
Shelly.

35:41.380 --> 35:42.623
Everybody knows Shelly.

35:44.245 --> 35:45.809
He knew St. Luther's.

35:45.833 --> 35:48.146
He said that he was there
for July's communion.

35:49.561 --> 35:51.908
So what are you thinking here,
you think he's clairvoyant?

35:53.220 --> 35:55.049
Maybe the accident
did something?

35:58.086 --> 36:00.468
Lawrence, look at me, buddy.

36:02.263 --> 36:04.886
How many fingers do you
think I have behind my back?

36:06.923 --> 36:07.958
Three, Daddy.

36:11.652 --> 36:12.446
Lawrence,

36:15.932 --> 36:18.693
maybe you can talk to
me about July Rain?

36:20.281 --> 36:22.110
Do you remember
what she looks like?

36:23.353 --> 36:26.229
Is her hair, is her
hair like my hair?

36:26.253 --> 36:27.081
No.

36:32.259 --> 36:33.881
What if we showed him a picture?

36:35.331 --> 36:36.584
I don't know.

36:36.608 --> 36:37.654
Well, you called
me down here, Ray.

36:37.678 --> 36:38.920
What do you want from me?

36:40.025 --> 36:41.613
Look, I don't know what this is.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.031
I got her file at the precinct.

36:47.135 --> 36:48.354
If you wanna know if maybe

36:48.378 --> 36:50.529
he just heard something
about her at the service

36:50.553 --> 36:52.451
or if there's something
else going on.

36:53.452 --> 36:54.971
Let's just stop guessing here.

36:59.838 --> 37:00.839
Ooh, yeah.

37:05.947 --> 37:07.270
I picked her up for stealing

37:07.294 --> 37:09.444
from the Wawa over
on Norton Street.

37:09.468 --> 37:11.056
She was 15 years old.

37:12.506 --> 37:15.209
About six months before
she'd gone missing.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.717
Wanna play a game, Lawrence?

37:19.961 --> 37:21.169
You see all these girls?

37:22.274 --> 37:24.103
You think you know
which one is July Rain?

37:46.471 --> 37:48.266
You sure, Lawrence?

37:52.270 --> 37:53.478
Jesus Christ.

37:55.307 --> 37:57.482
Did your Grandma show
you this photo before?

38:02.521 --> 38:03.350
Look at me.

38:04.868 --> 38:06.353
Did Mommy show you this photo?

38:07.457 --> 38:08.872
No, Daddy.
Don't lie to me.

38:09.735 --> 38:11.668
Ray, let's take a break.

38:22.196 --> 38:24.208
I don't know if this is
related to the accident,

38:24.232 --> 38:27.246
but I know the idea of someone

38:27.270 --> 38:29.997
trying to get into Lawrence's
head isn't what you want,

38:31.205 --> 38:33.034
but he's gonna need
to talk to somebody.

38:34.553 --> 38:36.600
We got this woman
out of Harrisburg.

38:36.624 --> 38:39.569
She's come out for child
trauma cases before.

38:39.593 --> 38:41.536
A real nice lady, a
little bit liberal

38:41.560 --> 38:42.779
with some of her techniques,

38:42.803 --> 38:44.218
but to tell you the truth,

38:46.669 --> 38:48.371
if I get on the
phone with someone

38:48.395 --> 38:51.028
from Sunbury or Lewisburg,

38:51.052 --> 38:52.778
I doubt they'd even
come over here.

38:54.401 --> 38:55.263
So...

38:58.888 --> 39:00.683
You knew what Maise
would have done.

39:03.271 --> 39:04.721
He's still your son, Ray.

40:19.382 --> 40:20.279
What's goin' on?

40:22.109 --> 40:24.501
To tell you the
truth, I don't know.

40:24.525 --> 40:26.527
My nephew is showing
signs of trauma.

40:27.701 --> 40:29.530
Hard to explain
right now, Chief.

40:30.738 --> 40:32.440
What's that got to do
with the Coleman case?

40:32.464 --> 40:33.292
Not sure.

40:34.432 --> 40:35.512
That's why I figured
I'd leave you be

40:35.536 --> 40:37.928
until I got something
more concrete.

40:37.952 --> 40:40.344
The Coleman case is cold.

40:40.368 --> 40:42.198
Yeah, I know, Chief.

40:43.855 --> 40:46.454
Alright, well, get out of there.

40:46.478 --> 40:47.800
Come on, now.

40:47.824 --> 40:49.481
And put your goddamn
belt back on.

41:47.263 --> 41:50.276
<i>♪ He said, I want you back</i>

41:50.300 --> 41:53.417
<i>♪ She said, you
can't have that ♪</i>

41:53.441 --> 41:56.455
<i>♪ He said, I want you back</i>

41:56.479 --> 42:01.149
<i>♪ She said, she's
never coming home ♪</i>

42:01.173 --> 42:04.221
<i>♪ Never coming home to you</i>

42:04.245 --> 42:07.190
<i>♪ Never coming home to you</i>

42:07.214 --> 42:09.641
<i>♪ Never coming home to you</i>

42:23.989 --> 42:26.761
<i>♪ Your love is a hurricane</i>

42:26.785 --> 42:29.902
<i>♪ Come on up and set me right</i>

42:29.926 --> 42:33.009
<i>♪ And you got me going under</i>

42:33.033 --> 42:35.598
<i>♪ With a heart
racing like thunder ♪</i>

42:35.622 --> 42:37.600
And so my job,
really, at this point,

42:37.624 --> 42:39.142
is just to merely hope

42:40.627 --> 42:42.560
that some part of the gospel

42:44.009 --> 42:48.186
gets through your brains and
your phones to your hearts.

42:49.394 --> 42:52.224
And for that, I will
be truly grateful.

42:53.709 --> 42:54.824
See you next week.

42:54.848 --> 42:55.676
God bless.

43:06.791 --> 43:09.563
Raymond, welcome.

43:09.587 --> 43:10.840
Marty.

43:10.864 --> 43:11.692
Sit.

43:18.319 --> 43:20.425
The Dark Knight has
arrived, Raymond,

43:21.771 --> 43:24.291
and he calls himself
the internet.

43:34.819 --> 43:35.923
You know, oftentimes

43:37.615 --> 43:39.202
it's when there are no answers

43:40.894 --> 43:43.137
that we struggle with
our faith the most.

43:46.106 --> 43:48.729
I'm not a very
religious man, Marty.

43:50.144 --> 43:52.675
We're all
born with faith, Raymond.

43:52.699 --> 43:53.561
Even you.

43:54.701 --> 43:56.461
Before your parents
were called on.

43:57.945 --> 43:59.464
You may not remember but I do.

44:02.640 --> 44:06.609
Well, I'm not
here for me, Marty.

44:09.854 --> 44:10.855
I'm here for my son.

44:25.352 --> 44:26.778
Do you think that a man's demons

44:26.802 --> 44:28.952
can be passed down to his son?

44:28.976 --> 44:30.668
We've all done things, Raymond.

44:33.843 --> 44:35.638
I don't think
that's true, Marty.

44:37.778 --> 44:39.756
I think that some
men have done things

44:39.780 --> 44:41.402
so that others don't have to.

44:49.203 --> 44:53.183
Have you ever seen
anybody die, Marty?

44:53.207 --> 44:54.622
Right there in front of you?

44:59.144 --> 45:00.145
I've done things,

45:04.115 --> 45:06.600
and I think that I've
cursed my son because of it.

45:07.808 --> 45:08.671
Phew.

45:16.299 --> 45:18.785
Would you let me pray for you?

45:20.648 --> 45:21.936
Yeah.

45:26.689 --> 45:27.621
Heavenly Father,

45:29.485 --> 45:30.797
hear our prayer.

45:32.591 --> 45:33.869
Guide us to peace.

46:01.275 --> 46:03.978
Ray, this is Sherry.

46:04.002 --> 46:04.831
Hi, Ray.

46:06.591 --> 46:08.845
I understand that you
just lost your wife.

46:08.869 --> 46:10.467
My deepest condolences.

46:10.491 --> 46:13.771
Death can be quite
confusing for the living.

46:16.739 --> 46:19.476
This the little child of
light you two made together?

46:19.500 --> 46:20.329
Yeah.
Hmm.

46:24.885 --> 46:27.301
Hey, what's your name?

46:29.062 --> 46:30.132
I'm Doctor Sherry.

46:32.306 --> 46:33.273
This is Lawrence.

46:36.310 --> 46:38.381
Hey, Lawrence, how
are you doing today?

46:40.418 --> 46:41.246
Good.

46:42.661 --> 46:46.804
Hmm, just doing some
light reading?

46:48.736 --> 46:51.474
So, Caroline, on the phone

46:51.498 --> 46:55.098
you said that he's been saying
some pretty wild things?

46:55.122 --> 46:57.400
Ever since we road up
here to bury my wife.

46:58.574 --> 47:00.990
He's known the names
of people and places.

47:02.785 --> 47:04.867
He's never been up here before.

47:04.891 --> 47:07.283
Hmm, and the girl
that you mentioned...

47:07.307 --> 47:08.377
July Rain Coleman.

47:09.550 --> 47:12.864
Huh, well, that's
a name, isn't it?

47:16.626 --> 47:18.915
Okay, well, why don't
I sit down with him,

47:18.939 --> 47:21.297
see if I can figure
out what's going on.

47:21.321 --> 47:22.885
I don't know how long
this is gonna take,

47:22.909 --> 47:25.290
but you're welcome to
wait right outside.

47:34.334 --> 47:35.759
That woman makes me more nervous

47:35.783 --> 47:37.520
than a crack head
with a shotgun.

47:40.581 --> 47:42.307
How are Burg and
Amanda holdin' up?

47:43.619 --> 47:44.482
Best they can.

47:47.795 --> 47:49.590
You know, Burg
served in the Gulf.

47:50.764 --> 47:52.707
I ain't sayin' he's
much for conversation,

47:52.731 --> 47:54.768
but he knows what
it's like out there.

47:55.942 --> 47:57.091
Everybody's got
their limits, Ray.

47:57.115 --> 47:59.117
Talkin' to someone
might serve you well.

48:02.672 --> 48:05.227
You have yourself a
beautiful boy there, Raymond.

48:07.160 --> 48:08.965
What are we lookin' at?

48:08.989 --> 48:11.209
Well, first you
have to understand

48:11.233 --> 48:15.144
that when a child is involved
in a tragic accident,

48:15.168 --> 48:18.216
they may suffer from
what some might call

48:18.240 --> 48:20.804
post-traumatic stress disorder.

48:20.828 --> 48:22.876
Right, you may know something

48:22.900 --> 48:25.016
about that being
in the military.

48:25.040 --> 48:27.145
So what?

48:28.353 --> 48:29.941
You think the accident did this?

48:31.805 --> 48:34.187
I think the accident
may have woken something.

48:35.602 --> 48:37.811
And what are
we talkin' about here?

48:39.019 --> 48:42.240
Come.

48:42.264 --> 48:45.139
Lawrence, look what I have.

48:45.163 --> 48:48.729
Now, Lawrence.

48:48.753 --> 48:53.423
I wanna talk about
July Rain again, okay?

48:53.447 --> 48:54.908
Like we just did.

48:54.932 --> 48:58.670
Your daddy wants to know
what we talked about, okay?

48:58.694 --> 48:59.626
It's okay, bud.

49:02.318 --> 49:05.943
So, where did you
hear the name July Rain?

49:09.532 --> 49:10.809
Yeah, in your head?

49:12.535 --> 49:13.329
Mm.

49:14.641 --> 49:15.998
And did you know her?

49:18.990 --> 49:20.336
When did you know her?

49:21.889 --> 49:22.718
Before.

49:24.340 --> 49:25.376
Before when, buddy?

49:28.931 --> 49:29.759
Before me.

49:34.281 --> 49:38.630
Huh, I mean, I have never
encountered this before,

49:39.804 --> 49:42.645
but I've heard stories
about it many times.

49:42.669 --> 49:47.029
In some cultures, children born
with distinctive birthmarks

49:47.053 --> 49:50.687
like Lawrence's, they are
watched very carefully

49:50.711 --> 49:51.678
as they develop.

49:53.059 --> 49:56.924
They believe that these
children have a special gift.

49:58.512 --> 50:02.527
That they can
remember information

50:02.551 --> 50:04.667
from before they were born.

50:04.691 --> 50:06.738
What are we talkin' about?

50:06.762 --> 50:09.006
Are we talkin' about
psychic ability?

50:10.386 --> 50:11.881
Ah...

50:11.905 --> 50:14.183
She thinks he's having
memories from a past life.

50:17.290 --> 50:19.188
I was stationed in
the Middle East.

50:20.569 --> 50:22.857
There are a number of
religious groups there

50:22.881 --> 50:24.918
that I think you're
referring to, Doctor.

50:26.368 --> 50:27.886
They believe in reincarnation.

50:30.475 --> 50:31.901
Sherry here thinks that Lawrence

50:31.925 --> 50:33.627
is remembering July because...

50:33.651 --> 50:35.870
He was July.

50:39.070 --> 50:44.041
Okay, what are you two
effing with me or something?

50:45.766 --> 50:48.562
No, it's not a joke, Caroline.

50:50.392 --> 50:51.955
And Ray, I'm happy
that you're familiar

50:51.979 --> 50:53.164
with some of these practices,

50:53.188 --> 50:55.407
but these events
have been documented

50:55.431 --> 50:56.615
throughout the world.

50:56.639 --> 50:58.203
They're not specific
to one place.

50:58.227 --> 50:59.515
I hate to break it to you,

50:59.539 --> 51:01.472
but this isn't some kind
of spiritual awakening.

51:02.680 --> 51:03.657
God knows you'd
have a bestseller

51:03.681 --> 51:05.107
on the shelves in a month.

51:05.131 --> 51:07.074
But you're reachin' here.

51:07.098 --> 51:09.894
And this, this ain't
helpin' my son.

51:15.210 --> 51:16.073
Ray?

51:21.285 --> 51:22.503
Ray?

51:22.527 --> 51:24.840
I'm sorry, Carol,
but Jesus Christ.

52:05.329 --> 52:06.847
Give us a scotch.

52:08.090 --> 52:08.918
Two.

52:14.372 --> 52:15.201
Thanks.

52:26.833 --> 52:28.224
There's plenty of empty tables

52:28.248 --> 52:29.698
you'd be more comfortable at.

52:30.871 --> 52:33.505
What is it that you do, exactly,

52:33.529 --> 52:35.255
Dr. Sheryln Bomont?

52:36.498 --> 52:38.224
And what business
is it of yours?

52:39.915 --> 52:43.194
Well, ordinarily I
just make it my business.

52:44.747 --> 52:48.520
But see you with
this kind of landed

52:48.544 --> 52:51.547
right in the middle of my
wheelhouse, you know what I mean?

52:52.997 --> 52:54.837
I treat people.

52:54.861 --> 52:56.621
Yes, that much I know.

52:58.002 --> 52:59.221
Of more interest to me

52:59.245 --> 53:02.317
is what you talked to
Ray Marrow's boy about?

53:08.978 --> 53:10.715
Now, while I'd love to breach

53:10.739 --> 53:12.648
the doctor, patient
code of ethics for you

53:12.672 --> 53:15.754
and your band of
degenerates over there,

53:15.778 --> 53:17.066
I think I'll refrain

53:18.022 --> 53:19.265
For the sake of my career.

53:26.410 --> 53:29.171
I don't always get to
practice non-violence.

53:31.069 --> 53:33.703
I always ask myself is that
because I'm a violent person,

53:33.727 --> 53:37.075
or because of the bullshit
I get from people?

53:39.733 --> 53:43.668
You see, I've been lied
to all my life, Doctor.

53:45.256 --> 53:47.672
And even when my baby
girl went missing,

53:49.295 --> 53:50.824
there was no person in this town

53:50.848 --> 53:53.713
who had a goddamn
word to say about it.

53:55.439 --> 53:56.819
All I'm askin'

53:58.890 --> 54:00.271
is for a little truth.

54:05.138 --> 54:06.657
Is that too much to ask, Doctor?

54:21.810 --> 54:23.156
One, two.
No.

54:24.916 --> 54:27.298
Better not
get hurt on that thing.

54:34.823 --> 54:36.997
You know, I never blamed
you when you left.

54:39.310 --> 54:41.046
I was proud that Mom
was proud of you,

54:41.070 --> 54:42.703
even to the end.

54:42.727 --> 54:43.556
She knew.

54:47.180 --> 54:49.976
I was fightin', it
was in our cards.

54:51.149 --> 54:52.634
You in the war and
me in the force.

54:54.636 --> 54:57.155
I knew that you'd be
alright once you joined up.

54:58.743 --> 54:59.572
Yeah.

55:08.339 --> 55:10.869
I don't know why things
always happen for us

55:10.893 --> 55:12.205
the way they do, Ray.

55:16.382 --> 55:20.120
God knows I wish that
we had it different

55:20.144 --> 55:21.397
but we don't.

55:23.596 --> 55:25.114
And for whatever reason,

55:29.774 --> 55:34.020
hell, this could give
us a little glimpse.

55:35.193 --> 55:36.609
I mean, what if this is true?

55:40.647 --> 55:42.028
I think we deserve it.

55:43.650 --> 55:46.584
I think we deserve a little
glimpse into the other side.

55:48.034 --> 55:51.945
And I think as much of shitty
person as Bernie Coleman is,

55:51.969 --> 55:53.419
I think he deserves it, too.

56:02.428 --> 56:03.715
Lawrence, get over here.

56:17.097 --> 56:18.489
You lied to me, Raymond.

56:18.513 --> 56:20.387
Bernie, listen to me.

56:20.411 --> 56:22.838
There's a lot of unanswered
questions right now,

56:22.862 --> 56:24.184
but I want you to think first.

56:24.208 --> 56:26.117
You gotta...
I gotta what?

56:26.141 --> 56:29.189
This bitch telling me my
daughter's inside of him?

56:29.213 --> 56:30.697
He knows what happened to her.

56:31.629 --> 56:33.227
Put the guns down.

56:33.251 --> 56:35.851
Fucking kill everybody here.

56:35.875 --> 56:37.186
I wanna talk to him.

56:38.049 --> 56:39.579
Put the guns down,

56:39.603 --> 56:43.790
and I'll let you come
over here and talk to him.

56:43.814 --> 56:44.711
Put 'em down.

57:01.556 --> 57:02.419
Baby girl?

57:04.766 --> 57:05.594
July?

57:08.459 --> 57:10.116
He ain't your daughter, Bernie.

57:12.152 --> 57:13.637
Are you in there, baby girl?

57:16.053 --> 57:17.064
How does this work, how...

57:17.088 --> 57:18.928
That's not July, Bernie.

57:18.952 --> 57:19.781
Look at him.

57:21.368 --> 57:23.578
What is he possessed
or somethin'?

57:24.751 --> 57:29.031
Lawrence, this
is Bernie Coleman.

57:31.793 --> 57:33.070
It's July's daddy.

57:36.176 --> 57:37.661
Are you in there, baby girl?

57:38.524 --> 57:40.398
Bernie?

57:40.422 --> 57:42.158
What, what's happening?

57:42.182 --> 57:43.114
Talk to me.

57:47.464 --> 57:48.361
Is she gone?

57:51.778 --> 57:52.848
What happened to you?

57:53.849 --> 57:55.482
I gotta know, please?

57:55.506 --> 57:58.209
July, I'm so sorry I
wasn't there for you.

57:58.233 --> 58:00.591
Alright, look, I need
you to let go of him now.

58:00.615 --> 58:03.594
You're not takin' my baby girl.

58:03.618 --> 58:04.481
Ray.

58:07.207 --> 58:10.946
You do it, you
think I give a shit?

58:10.970 --> 58:13.327
You let him go,
and I swear to you,

58:13.351 --> 58:16.078
I will stay in town until we
get to the bottom of this.

58:18.805 --> 58:20.507
But if you don't, I will
put a bullet in you,

58:20.531 --> 58:22.740
and you're never gonna
get any of your answers.

58:23.845 --> 58:26.606
God.

59:03.056 --> 59:07.992
Hey, you okay?

59:45.754 --> 59:47.629
She sounded iffy on the phone.

59:47.653 --> 59:50.114
Bernie probably scared her
straight back to Harrisburg.

59:50.138 --> 59:51.311
Good morning.

59:52.658 --> 59:53.807
Good morning, Dr. Bomont.

59:53.831 --> 59:55.177
Hello, Lawrence.

59:57.214 --> 59:58.398
Ray.

59:58.422 --> 01:00:00.469
I am so sorry about Bernie.
Oh, No.

01:00:00.493 --> 01:00:01.815
I should apologize.

01:00:01.839 --> 01:00:04.497
He just didn't leave
me much of an option.

01:00:05.671 --> 01:00:07.821
Ray, I wanna thank you
for choosing to do this.

01:00:07.845 --> 01:00:09.374
I think that you'll find

01:00:09.398 --> 01:00:11.608
that this helps you as much
as it helps Lawrence, here.

01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:13.965
How do we do this?

01:00:13.989 --> 01:00:18.038
We just walk inside the memory.

01:00:18.062 --> 01:00:19.281
Remember that old board game?

01:00:19.305 --> 01:00:22.077
Maybe you played it
when you were a child?

01:00:22.101 --> 01:00:23.596
If Lawrence sees something,

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:26.771
a street or a shop or a building

01:00:26.795 --> 01:00:30.188
that he can match to some
image he has in his head,

01:00:30.212 --> 01:00:33.191
and he can build those
images into a pattern.

01:00:33.215 --> 01:00:36.391
Into thoughts, and
hopefully, into memories.

01:00:43.122 --> 01:00:43.916
Come on, buddy.

01:00:44.986 --> 01:00:47.033
We're gonna play a game, okay?

01:00:47.057 --> 01:00:49.715
Winner gets his very
own stack of pancakes.

01:00:52.476 --> 01:00:53.270
Okay.

01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:15.672
Parzano's.

01:01:36.313 --> 01:01:37.279
Anthony's.

01:01:42.043 --> 01:01:42.951
Krug's.

01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:25.836
It was hers.

01:03:27.217 --> 01:03:28.401
It was July's.

01:03:30.427 --> 01:03:32.118
Did I do good, Daddy?

01:03:33.671 --> 01:03:35.294
Did I earn the pancakes?

01:03:37.883 --> 01:03:38.745
Yeah, bud.

01:03:39.643 --> 01:03:40.471
You won.

01:03:42.473 --> 01:03:43.474
You did really good.

01:03:50.378 --> 01:03:51.493
Chief, I don't expect

01:03:51.517 --> 01:03:52.311
you to understand.
Shut up.

01:03:56.315 --> 01:04:00.226
Look, I realize in the
whole scheme of things,

01:04:00.250 --> 01:04:03.184
your family has been dealt
a hard hand with death.

01:04:04.979 --> 01:04:05.921
Be honest, that's why I thought

01:04:05.945 --> 01:04:07.119
you'd be good at this job.

01:04:08.223 --> 01:04:09.752
It's best to know death

01:04:09.776 --> 01:04:11.893
is gonna be knockin' on your
door at every traffic stop.

01:04:11.917 --> 01:04:13.411
But your brother
comin' back here

01:04:13.435 --> 01:04:14.585
with his troubled

01:04:14.609 --> 01:04:15.862
kid startin'...
That's my nephew.

01:04:15.886 --> 01:04:16.783
I said, shut up.

01:04:20.166 --> 01:04:21.247
Did you ever think
for one minute

01:04:21.271 --> 01:04:22.859
how this would effect this town?

01:04:24.274 --> 01:04:26.528
That's the trouble
with America today.

01:04:26.552 --> 01:04:28.692
No one lets a dead dog lie.

01:04:29.796 --> 01:04:31.419
A man lost his daughter.

01:04:32.938 --> 01:04:34.708
And you want me to
ask him to relive that

01:04:34.732 --> 01:04:36.883
'cause some kid is
playing hide and go seek?

01:04:36.907 --> 01:04:39.565
You've known me longer
than my own daddy, Gordon.

01:04:40.704 --> 01:04:41.923
In that time, I
feel like I've tried

01:04:41.947 --> 01:04:43.925
to be an asset to
this department,

01:04:43.949 --> 01:04:45.650
and I've kept the
oath that I swore to,

01:04:45.674 --> 01:04:47.031
but this, this is...

01:04:47.055 --> 01:04:49.275
Here's what's gonna happen.

01:04:49.299 --> 01:04:52.381
I'm gonna forget we ever
had this conversation.

01:04:52.405 --> 01:04:53.969
Your brother's gonna
pack his van up

01:04:53.993 --> 01:04:55.315
and go back to the big city,

01:04:55.339 --> 01:04:58.663
and you are gonna
return to being

01:04:58.687 --> 01:05:00.724
a model officer
in this community.

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:04.624
Now if you don't mind,

01:05:06.281 --> 01:05:08.249
Shelly's chili dogs
are calling my name.

01:05:30.374 --> 01:05:31.524
So have a good day.

01:05:31.548 --> 01:05:33.388
Thanks, Warren.

01:05:33.412 --> 01:05:34.654
Thanks, ladies.

01:05:39.659 --> 01:05:41.051
Ray?

01:05:41.075 --> 01:05:42.466
Do us both a favor
and get your son

01:05:42.490 --> 01:05:44.123
back to Philadelphia, will ya?

01:05:44.147 --> 01:05:45.331
You get him some help.

01:05:45.355 --> 01:05:46.849
Leave the people
of this town alone.

01:05:46.873 --> 01:05:48.092
I don't like this
anymore than you do,

01:05:48.116 --> 01:05:49.783
but something is going
on here, Sheriff.

01:05:49.807 --> 01:05:51.026
If you ain't gonna fix it,

01:05:51.050 --> 01:05:52.096
then you should sue me

01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:53.580
Because I'm not going...
Lawrence?

01:05:53.604 --> 01:05:54.996
Lawrence?

01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:56.135
He did it, Daddy.

01:05:56.159 --> 01:05:57.550
It was him.

01:05:57.574 --> 01:05:58.506
He hurt July.

01:06:00.128 --> 01:06:01.140
What are you doing?

01:06:01.164 --> 01:06:02.141
You don't do that.

01:06:02.165 --> 01:06:03.004
No, daddy, no.
Just, shut up.

01:06:03.028 --> 01:06:03.970
Praise to Christ.

01:06:03.994 --> 01:06:06.272
It's okay.
He hurt, July.

01:06:07.066 --> 01:06:08.240
Until next Sunday.

01:06:09.310 --> 01:06:10.114
Goddamn it.
He hurt July.

01:06:10.138 --> 01:06:11.322
Lawrence, stop.

01:06:15.764 --> 01:06:17.432
Get over to the Coleman ranch.

01:06:17.456 --> 01:06:20.814
You better hope Norma doesn't
flap her gums to Bernie.

01:06:20.838 --> 01:06:21.815
What'd you think
was gonna happen

01:06:21.839 --> 01:06:23.231
with your little
stunt here, huh?

01:06:23.255 --> 01:06:25.405
I swear to God, anything
happens to my brother,

01:06:25.429 --> 01:06:26.844
I'm holding you responsible.

01:06:27.914 --> 01:06:28.961
I'll come with you.

01:07:05.262 --> 01:07:06.481
Ain't no goddamn way

01:07:06.505 --> 01:07:09.346
you got a warrant
that fast, Caroline.

01:07:09.370 --> 01:07:10.992
I didn't see you there, Norma.

01:07:12.373 --> 01:07:17.067
Just wanna word with your boy.

01:07:17.826 --> 01:07:18.482
I heard your nephew.

01:07:19.104 --> 01:07:21.082
We all heard him.

01:07:21.106 --> 01:07:22.831
Boy's got the devil in him.

01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:27.536
Well, it's hard to say.

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:29.631
It's a bit confusing
right now, isn't it?

01:07:31.081 --> 01:07:33.025
It would really help if I
could speak with Bernie.

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:34.429
Is he inside?

01:07:36.431 --> 01:07:37.719
I told him the
boy must have caught

01:07:37.743 --> 01:07:40.297
some demon in the car
when his mama died.

01:07:41.574 --> 01:07:43.749
Pastor Hirsch, a killer?

01:07:46.959 --> 01:07:48.074
You know, I've always been fair

01:07:48.098 --> 01:07:49.686
with you and your family, Norma.

01:07:51.101 --> 01:07:52.561
Even through the investigation,

01:07:52.585 --> 01:07:55.450
I treated that case like July
was one of my own, didn't I?

01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:57.980
Bernie, come on out.

01:07:59.385 --> 01:08:01.053
I always liked you, Caroline.

01:08:04.045 --> 01:08:06.437
Your mama was a
good friend of mine.

01:08:07.738 --> 01:08:09.923
But what your brother spawned,

01:08:09.947 --> 01:08:11.604
Bernie's coming for answers.

01:08:13.330 --> 01:08:15.136
And with the Lord on his side,

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:17.714
he'll right the wrongs
done to this family.

01:08:19.404 --> 01:08:21.245
You can believe that.

01:08:21.269 --> 01:08:22.752
I swear to God, Norma,

01:08:23.616 --> 01:08:24.835
I ain't askin' this time.

01:08:24.859 --> 01:08:26.042
Don't fuck with me.

01:08:44.189 --> 01:08:48.859
Chief, Chief, come in.

01:08:48.883 --> 01:08:51.103
I'm on my way to his
house in South Harrisburg.

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:53.129
Put off on...
Goddammit.

01:08:56.477 --> 01:08:57.892
Has she contacted you?

01:09:02.207 --> 01:09:04.036
He's gonna want answers, Marty.

01:09:07.798 --> 01:09:08.937
Jesus Christ.

01:09:10.524 --> 01:09:12.502
It's the word of
a five year old.

01:09:12.527 --> 01:09:14.988
Now you know how
people around here are.

01:09:15.011 --> 01:09:16.921
If a raccoon came
out of the woods

01:09:16.944 --> 01:09:18.751
and started talking about
Bernie Coleman's daughter,

01:09:18.774 --> 01:09:21.202
then animal control would
be cleaning up raccoons

01:09:21.225 --> 01:09:22.710
for the next year and a half.

01:09:27.542 --> 01:09:28.785
After all this time.

01:09:30.234 --> 01:09:32.661
Only thing you gotta do
is just keep your mouth shut

01:09:32.685 --> 01:09:33.790
on this right now.

01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:38.174
Let me deal with the
Coleman's and the Marrow boy.

01:09:42.350 --> 01:09:43.179
But listen,

01:09:47.252 --> 01:09:48.573
if we come down to it,

01:09:48.598 --> 01:09:51.256
if we get to a breaking point,

01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:54.614
I want you to think about
offering up what you know.

01:09:54.638 --> 01:09:59.540
Oh, they ain't gonna believe
I just put her on a bus.

01:10:01.335 --> 01:10:02.508
Huh, well,

01:10:04.752 --> 01:10:06.074
I'll take being a lousy lawman

01:10:06.098 --> 01:10:08.283
and you being a son of a bitch

01:10:08.307 --> 01:10:10.136
over lettin' 'em
hang you for this.

01:10:11.483 --> 01:10:14.002
We're talkin' 'bout the
goddamn Coleman's here, Marty.

01:10:16.315 --> 01:10:18.466
Now I want you to come back
to the precinct with me.

01:10:18.490 --> 01:10:20.492
The only way I know
you'll be safe.

01:10:22.079 --> 01:10:23.264
I go hiding at the precinct,

01:10:23.288 --> 01:10:25.162
I may as well put a
guilty sign on my chest.

01:10:25.186 --> 01:10:26.577
Now you have to
trust me on this one.

01:10:33.125 --> 01:10:34.022
Caroline, come in.

01:10:35.334 --> 01:10:36.380
Chief?

01:10:36.404 --> 01:10:37.716
Chief, I'm pulling up now.

01:10:39.304 --> 01:10:41.685
Looks like some kind of barn.

01:10:42.859 --> 01:10:44.930
I'm on my way.

01:10:46.172 --> 01:10:47.933
Can you get to the precinct?

01:10:49.210 --> 01:10:51.533
I wouldn't ask if I
had somebody else.

01:10:51.557 --> 01:10:53.397
Best case scenario,
we bring Bernie in,

01:10:53.421 --> 01:10:55.537
and you get to listen to
one of Marty's sermons.

01:11:04.812 --> 01:11:07.124
Do me a favor, just stay here.

01:11:14.925 --> 01:11:16.558
You let me deal
with Bernie Coleman.

01:11:30.009 --> 01:11:31.159
Come on, bud.

01:11:31.183 --> 01:11:32.850
Let's get you sorted.

01:11:32.874 --> 01:11:34.645
Grandma's got your
favorite pancakes

01:11:34.669 --> 01:11:36.153
in the car all ready for ya.

01:11:38.466 --> 01:11:39.857
I need you to talk to him.

01:11:39.881 --> 01:11:41.711
Find out what you can.

01:11:44.196 --> 01:11:46.612
Well, come on, if you're coming.

01:13:13.492 --> 01:13:14.562
Shit, shit.

01:13:17.323 --> 01:13:19.854
Chief, there's no one
here, we gotta get back.

01:14:07.304 --> 01:14:08.133
Pastor.

01:14:12.551 --> 01:14:13.414
You have a gun?

01:14:33.296 --> 01:14:34.124
You alone?

01:14:36.679 --> 01:14:38.128
Now open the goddamn door.

01:14:56.802 --> 01:14:59.540
So, I wanna talk about

01:14:59.564 --> 01:15:02.912
where you've seen the
pastor before, Lawrence.

01:15:08.814 --> 01:15:09.919
In the woods.

01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:15.821
In what woods, Lawrence?

01:15:55.930 --> 01:15:58.899
I've served this
community for 30 years.

01:16:00.176 --> 01:16:01.108
I know you have.

01:16:02.937 --> 01:16:05.353
And I know that you're
not a violent man, Marty.

01:16:08.909 --> 01:16:13.741
Bernie Coleman is not the
type to listen to reason.

01:16:22.508 --> 01:16:25.177
Do you believe your boy?

01:16:25.201 --> 01:16:26.627
I don't know what
I believe anymore.

01:16:43.668 --> 01:16:44.530
Pastor?

01:16:46.256 --> 01:16:48.362
I need you to get
someplace safe and hide.

01:16:49.363 --> 01:16:50.374
Now.

01:17:03.826 --> 01:17:05.389
You don't wanna do this.

01:17:05.413 --> 01:17:07.322
This is not gonna end well

01:17:07.346 --> 01:17:09.245
if you make me come
in there, Raymond.

01:17:12.558 --> 01:17:13.387
Let him go.

01:17:14.699 --> 01:17:15.710
He's good where he is.

01:17:15.734 --> 01:17:16.711
Goddamn it, Bernie.

01:17:16.735 --> 01:17:18.161
I want 'em in the same room,

01:17:18.185 --> 01:17:20.128
and I wanna hear him say it.

01:17:20.152 --> 01:17:22.786
You ask him right here.

01:17:22.810 --> 01:17:23.994
Not like this.

01:17:24.018 --> 01:17:25.755
I said I want the truth.

01:17:25.779 --> 01:17:27.090
I ain't gonna get it here.

01:17:29.437 --> 01:17:30.266
Put the gun down.

01:17:38.170 --> 01:17:41.736
You know, Gordy's gonna be
pullin' up any second now.

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:44.073
You think his brother's
gonna give me a fair say?

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:48.294
You're on the clock
here, Raymond.

01:17:59.088 --> 01:17:59.916
Enough.

01:18:07.993 --> 01:18:11.065
If I take you to
him, they stay here.

01:18:12.653 --> 01:18:14.424
I just want answers.

01:18:14.448 --> 01:18:15.518
This is it, Bernie.

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:18.348
No guns.

01:18:19.349 --> 01:18:20.247
Including yours.

01:18:26.356 --> 01:18:28.255
We take my van.

01:18:38.265 --> 01:18:40.070
Jesus, please don't do this.

01:18:40.094 --> 01:18:41.554
Oh, God.

01:18:41.578 --> 01:18:43.487
Please don't do this.

01:19:13.403 --> 01:19:14.656
Ray?

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:15.588
Please.

01:19:37.531 --> 01:19:39.740
Are you sure you
don't wanna play, baby?

01:19:41.431 --> 01:19:42.754
Daddy.

01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:45.056
Oh, he'll be back
for ya soon, bud.

01:19:50.337 --> 01:19:51.693
Amanda?

01:19:51.717 --> 01:19:54.213
I want you to get
him in the back.

01:19:54.237 --> 01:19:55.145
Lawrence.

01:20:04.938 --> 01:20:05.801
Ray?

01:20:18.089 --> 01:20:20.964
Ray, this has gone way too far.

01:20:20.988 --> 01:20:22.276
He's unarmed.

01:20:37.902 --> 01:20:38.730
Raymond?

01:20:43.252 --> 01:20:44.149
It's okay.

01:20:48.464 --> 01:20:49.361
Daddy?

01:20:53.745 --> 01:20:55.747
What y'all are doing,
this isn't right.

01:20:58.198 --> 01:21:00.797
Look, look here,
baby girl, July.

01:21:00.821 --> 01:21:01.971
Come, come, come, come

01:21:01.995 --> 01:21:02.937
a little closer.
He's not possessed,

01:21:02.961 --> 01:21:04.111
you half-wit.
Shut up!

01:21:04.135 --> 01:21:05.422
This is insane.

01:21:05.446 --> 01:21:06.344
That's enough.

01:21:09.554 --> 01:21:11.394
How do we do this?
I wanna hear it

01:21:11.418 --> 01:21:12.636
fro, fro, from him,

01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:14.569
and I wanna, I wanna
hear what he saw.

01:21:14.593 --> 01:21:15.629
Please, be quiet.

01:21:17.044 --> 01:21:19.875
Lawrence, do you
recognize this man?

01:21:22.394 --> 01:21:23.785
What did you do?

01:21:23.809 --> 01:21:25.304
Ray, please?

01:21:25.328 --> 01:21:26.502
Lawrence, look at me.

01:21:27.675 --> 01:21:28.987
Did he hurt July?

01:21:30.264 --> 01:21:32.104
This is a child's imagination.

01:21:32.128 --> 01:21:34.648
You shut your fucking mouth.

01:21:36.408 --> 01:21:37.409
It's alright, bud.

01:21:39.825 --> 01:21:40.654
What is it?

01:21:42.138 --> 01:21:42.967
He hit her.

01:21:44.485 --> 01:21:45.704
You think for one moment

01:21:45.728 --> 01:21:47.212
that this man's
gonna let me live?

01:21:49.801 --> 01:21:50.985
That you're willing
to carry that?

01:21:51.009 --> 01:21:53.011
Lawrence, did he kill July?

01:21:53.943 --> 01:21:55.196
You motherfucker!

01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:56.646
No!

01:21:56.670 --> 01:21:57.578
Bernie!

01:21:57.602 --> 01:21:58.613
Bernie, don't.

01:21:58.637 --> 01:21:59.960
No, Bernie.

01:22:00.743 --> 01:22:01.962
No!

01:22:01.986 --> 01:22:03.515
Okay.

01:22:15.344 --> 01:22:16.172
Ray?

01:23:18.959 --> 01:23:19.787

01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:40.877
Lawrence?

01:23:43.673 --> 01:23:44.605
Lawrence?

01:23:54.270 --> 01:23:55.202

It's okay, Bernie.

01:24:32.274 --> 01:24:33.906
Ray, don't take
another goddamn step.

01:24:33.930 --> 01:24:35.035
It's not your fault.

01:24:35.967 --> 01:24:37.289
Ray.

01:24:37.313 --> 01:24:38.142
She loved you.

01:24:45.356 --> 01:24:46.184
Lawrence?

01:25:04.099 --> 01:25:04.927

01:25:07.654 --> 01:25:08.482
Hey, hey.

01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:12.531
Are you okay, bud?

01:25:12.555 --> 01:25:14.212
Down there, Daddy.

01:25:17.388 --> 01:25:18.285
Down there.

01:25:34.336 --> 01:25:36.314
Not here.

01:26:55.589 --> 01:26:57.602
I need to see
your hands, Pastor.

01:26:57.626 --> 01:26:58.568
Now.

01:27:05.634 --> 01:27:08.568
Do you trust the
words of a child?

01:27:09.707 --> 01:27:12.133
For they are the keepers
of the divine light.

01:27:12.157 --> 01:27:13.756
Marty?

01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:15.195
Jesus Christ.

01:27:17.301 --> 01:27:19.382
Stand down, Caroline.
She had no business being

01:27:19.406 --> 01:27:20.314
in this town.

01:27:20.338 --> 01:27:21.201
I told her.

01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:23.662
She was better.

01:27:23.686 --> 01:27:25.067
She should see the world.

01:27:28.243 --> 01:27:30.151
Marty, don't say another word.

01:27:30.175 --> 01:27:32.326
I loved her.
Marty, listen,

01:27:32.350 --> 01:27:33.603
Marty.
I loved her.

01:27:33.627 --> 01:27:35.433
The ambulance is
on the way, Marty.

01:27:35.457 --> 01:27:36.285
I loved her.

01:27:38.874 --> 01:27:40.300
I tried.

01:27:40.324 --> 01:27:41.749
I put her on that bus,

01:27:41.773 --> 01:27:42.785
Gordy.
Mart...

01:27:42.809 --> 01:27:44.189
Shut the fuck up, Marty.

01:27:45.398 --> 01:27:47.652
Caroline, holster your weapon.

01:27:47.676 --> 01:27:48.470
You knew.

01:27:50.230 --> 01:27:52.715
Deputy Marrow,
put your gun down.

01:27:54.165 --> 01:27:55.556
He did the right thing by
puttin' her on that bus

01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:57.178
and gettin' her the
hell out of this town.

01:27:57.202 --> 01:27:59.180
Jesus Christ, Gordon.

01:27:59.204 --> 01:28:01.804
But she showed up in
the middle of the night.

01:28:01.828 --> 01:28:02.656
Are you kidding?

01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:06.015
She convinced the bus
driver to drop her off.

01:28:06.039 --> 01:28:07.499
It was pouring rain.

01:28:07.523 --> 01:28:08.352
Marty...

01:28:10.077 --> 01:28:11.745
I'm sorry, Gordy.

01:28:11.769 --> 01:28:13.471
She was gonna tell her father.

01:28:13.495 --> 01:28:14.886
She just wouldn't listen.

01:28:14.910 --> 01:28:17.198
Don't...
Gordy, I tried.

01:28:17.222 --> 01:28:18.776
You don't know
what you're sayin'.

01:28:47.598 --> 01:28:49.600
I'm sorry.
You're hurt.

01:28:50.670 --> 01:28:52.303
I'm sorry, Gordy.

01:28:52.327 --> 01:28:54.512
You need medical
attention, Marty,

01:28:54.536 --> 01:28:55.720
okay?
It's okay, Deputy.

01:28:55.744 --> 01:28:56.893
Marty, Marty, come here.

01:28:56.917 --> 01:28:57.791
It's okay.
Just come here.

01:28:57.815 --> 01:29:00.345
No!

01:29:00.369 --> 01:29:02.071
Oh, my God!

01:29:02.095 --> 01:29:07.031
Marty?

01:29:10.034 --> 01:29:11.794
Oh, Marty, goddammit.

01:29:23.427 --> 01:29:24.393
Come here.

01:31:34.903 --> 01:31:36.421
How we doin', bud?

01:31:37.561 --> 01:31:39.090
Look Mommy, did you it?

01:31:40.805 --> 01:31:42.082
We can still go.

01:31:43.808 --> 01:31:46.570
No, I'm fine, Daddy.
