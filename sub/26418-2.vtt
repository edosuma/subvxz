00:01.218 --> 00:03.264
Previously on Van Helsing...

00:03.307 --> 00:05.179
[groans]

00:05.788 --> 00:08.399
Your sister sent me
to find you.

00:09.705 --> 00:13.056
[crying]
Vanessa... Vanessa...

00:13.100 --> 00:13.970
Susan?

00:14.014 --> 00:14.710
The elder.

00:14.753 --> 00:16.059
It's pledged to help us.

00:16.103 --> 00:18.148
It took on a persona
it was comfortable with.

00:18.192 --> 00:19.541
Mom?

00:19.584 --> 00:21.630
Each elder has something.

00:21.673 --> 00:24.589
A totem that leads
to the dark one.

00:24.633 --> 00:26.548
Stop the elders.

00:26.591 --> 00:28.289
Find the totems.

00:28.332 --> 00:29.594
So where's yours?

00:29.638 --> 00:30.595
Give it to me.

00:30.639 --> 00:31.466
I cannot.

00:31.509 --> 00:32.945
I do not possess it.

00:32.989 --> 00:35.948
Well, I know what I gotta
do so I'm gonna go do it.

00:35.992 --> 00:37.863
We're in this together,
until the end.

00:37.907 --> 00:39.300
You and me.

00:39.343 --> 00:40.779
All of us.

00:40.823 --> 00:42.607
Let's go kill some vampires.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.574
[rain pouring]

00:54.619 --> 00:58.058
[thunder rolls]

01:11.288 --> 01:13.421
[horse whinnies]

02:02.122 --> 02:04.907
Good evening,
I'm Edward Hawkins,

02:04.950 --> 02:06.038
Lord Hawkins.

02:06.082 --> 02:07.562
And this is my wife, Lillian.

02:07.605 --> 02:09.346
We've been expecting you, sir.

02:09.390 --> 02:10.782
Indeed.

02:10.826 --> 02:16.397
Lillian is here to, um...
she's here indefinitely.

02:18.964 --> 02:20.618
For rest.

02:20.662 --> 02:22.272
Naturally.

02:27.234 --> 02:29.192
I do hope you know
what you're doing.

02:29.236 --> 02:30.759
I do.

02:33.849 --> 02:36.199
Give this to our daughter.

02:36.243 --> 02:38.027
For safe keeping.

02:40.899 --> 02:46.122
And darling, if I do not return,
you know what to do.

02:55.218 --> 02:56.350
Very good.

02:56.393 --> 02:59.396
Just a few preliminary
questions, then.

02:59.440 --> 03:00.702
Maiden name?

03:00.745 --> 03:02.182
Van Helsing.

03:04.227 --> 03:07.491
Lillian Van Helsing.

03:07.535 --> 03:10.015
But you may call me Lilly.

03:11.278 --> 03:13.976
[thunder rolls]

03:15.978 --> 03:19.329
[distant screaming]

03:43.875 --> 03:47.662
[distant screaming]

03:54.146 --> 03:56.932
Thank you, my pretty one.

03:56.975 --> 03:58.716
I'll see you again tomorrow
night.

03:58.760 --> 04:01.284
[kissing sounds]

04:01.328 --> 04:02.807
Well, well.

04:02.851 --> 04:05.332
Looks like somebody's
lost their way.

04:05.375 --> 04:08.378
I'd be glad to help you back
to your room, missy.

04:08.422 --> 04:10.250
That won't be necessary.

04:10.293 --> 04:11.990
I'll find my own way.

04:24.873 --> 04:27.441
[choking]

05:33.855 --> 05:37.772
[faint screeching]

06:30.694 --> 06:33.305
[whispers]

06:38.485 --> 06:39.921
My god.

06:42.619 --> 06:48.538
[cries out in pain]

06:48.582 --> 06:50.235
What are you?

07:00.681 --> 07:02.291
No!

07:04.119 --> 07:06.469
[groans]

07:08.776 --> 07:11.169
[cries out in pain]

07:31.320 --> 07:33.757
We're closer now,
I can feel it.

07:33.801 --> 07:34.976
This?

07:35.019 --> 07:36.107
This is where your totem is?

07:36.151 --> 07:38.458
In a shitty little cabin
in the woods?

07:38.501 --> 07:40.677
Soon all will be revealed
to you.

07:40.721 --> 07:42.287
You know what?

07:42.331 --> 07:43.506
I don't like how this works
because it really sounds like

07:43.550 --> 07:45.073
you think you're in charge
and you're not,

07:45.116 --> 07:46.727
so remember that.

07:46.770 --> 07:48.424
Soon.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.818
Just go.

07:52.820 --> 07:54.648
And are you gonna finally
start talking?

07:54.691 --> 07:56.040
Or is this how
it's gonna be?

07:56.084 --> 07:57.651
The elder's just gonna
wander around

07:57.694 --> 08:00.001
and you're gonna follow it and
then we're gonna follow you?

08:00.044 --> 08:02.220
No one's saying anything
to anybody?

08:02.264 --> 08:04.484
Sounds good to me.

08:05.963 --> 08:07.051
It's good to have her back, huh?

08:07.095 --> 08:08.966
Yeah, a real treat.

08:10.533 --> 08:11.491
[knocking]

08:14.406 --> 08:15.625
Yeah? What is it?

08:15.669 --> 08:16.539
Easy.

08:16.583 --> 08:17.671
We just need some help.

08:17.714 --> 08:19.281
We're a little lost right now.

08:19.324 --> 08:20.151
Where?

08:20.195 --> 08:21.805
To the asylum.

08:23.590 --> 08:26.331
Why would I wanna go there?

08:26.375 --> 08:28.377
What's in it for me?

08:34.775 --> 08:36.124
Come back in the morning then.

08:36.167 --> 08:38.169
No one wants to go up there
this time of night,

08:38.213 --> 08:39.606
believe you me.

08:41.390 --> 08:43.131
We do.

08:43.174 --> 08:45.002
Ok then.

08:45.046 --> 08:46.090
Now?

08:46.134 --> 08:47.091
Now.

08:47.135 --> 08:50.878
[thunder rolls]

08:59.626 --> 09:02.280
This is as far as I go.

09:02.324 --> 09:03.194
[growling]

09:03.238 --> 09:04.195
Hey! Hey!

09:04.239 --> 09:05.240
Woah, woah, woah!

09:05.283 --> 09:06.850
What the hell are you doing?!

09:07.634 --> 09:08.765
Ah.

09:08.809 --> 09:11.638
I must feed.

09:11.681 --> 09:14.031
He helped us get here,
for Christ's sakes.

09:18.949 --> 09:19.907
It doesn't matter.

09:19.950 --> 09:22.257
I must feed.

09:22.300 --> 09:23.475
What the hell?

09:35.400 --> 09:37.489
It's over, ok?

09:37.533 --> 09:39.579
It happened. Let's go.

09:43.887 --> 09:45.846
Ok.

09:48.196 --> 09:51.634
You're sure that totem of
yours is here somewhere?

09:51.678 --> 09:53.070
It is.

09:53.114 --> 09:54.985
I can feel it.

09:55.029 --> 09:57.074
I know it is.

10:35.896 --> 10:38.463
Okay, totem.

10:38.507 --> 10:40.814
What the hell are
we looking for?

10:40.857 --> 10:41.815
What is it?

10:41.858 --> 10:44.774
What does it look like, huh?

10:44.818 --> 10:47.472
Now what're you doing?

10:47.516 --> 10:48.691
Why are you just standing there?

10:48.735 --> 10:50.258
[snaps fingers]
Hey.

10:50.301 --> 10:52.652
Come on, take us to it!

10:52.695 --> 10:54.349
I cannot.

10:54.392 --> 10:56.830
There's a presence here.

10:56.873 --> 11:00.529
A powerful force causing
my thoughts to be hazy.

11:00.572 --> 11:02.139
When you see it you will know.

11:02.183 --> 11:03.880
That's really great, thank you.

11:03.924 --> 11:05.665
So helpful.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.320
Oh, no, no, no.

11:09.364 --> 11:10.713
You're not coming with us.

11:10.757 --> 11:12.062
We might actually find someone
in there.

11:12.106 --> 11:15.718
We can't have you feasting
on them so sit down.

11:15.762 --> 11:16.980
Now.

11:17.024 --> 11:18.852
[hisses]

11:29.819 --> 11:31.255
Mmm.

11:39.568 --> 11:41.004
Why don't we split up,
see what we can find,

11:41.048 --> 11:42.702
and meet back here?

11:42.745 --> 11:43.877
Haven't you ever seen
a horror movie?

11:43.920 --> 11:45.269
That's exactly what
we shouldn't do.

11:45.313 --> 11:46.618
Yeah, Axel's right.

11:46.662 --> 11:48.751
We should be doing
this together, like we said.

11:48.795 --> 11:50.057
Ok, I'm not opposed to that,

11:50.100 --> 11:52.233
it's just we'd cover more ground
initially if we-

11:52.276 --> 11:53.321
Come on now sleeping beauty.

11:53.364 --> 11:54.409
Ok, you know what?
Just forget it.

11:54.452 --> 11:56.150
Let's go.

12:15.691 --> 12:16.823
Shit.

12:16.866 --> 12:18.607
A bunch of dead bodies.

12:19.608 --> 12:21.175
[clatter]

12:21.218 --> 12:22.829
Oh, sorry.

12:35.798 --> 12:37.626
No.

12:44.894 --> 12:46.548
Vampires.

12:56.863 --> 12:58.778
[growling]

12:59.126 --> 13:01.258
What're they doing?

13:01.302 --> 13:02.172
I don't know.

13:02.216 --> 13:03.260
They're just standing there.

13:03.304 --> 13:04.348
What the hell kinda vampires
do that?

13:04.392 --> 13:05.959
I said I don't know.

13:14.228 --> 13:17.318
[cries out in pain]

13:17.361 --> 13:19.755
Jesus Christ, my head!

13:22.279 --> 13:24.020
We need to do something, now!

13:38.252 --> 13:39.253
[gun shot]

13:58.707 --> 14:00.665
[gun shots]

14:15.506 --> 14:18.118
You gotta kill them
in the head!

14:18.161 --> 14:19.946
[groaning]

14:49.018 --> 14:50.846
[screaming]

15:04.904 --> 15:06.731
[gun shot]

15:24.314 --> 15:26.142
[screaming]

15:30.059 --> 15:35.282
[retching]

15:43.116 --> 15:44.900
My, my.

15:46.684 --> 15:49.035
So, you too?

15:49.078 --> 15:51.341
Looks like it.

15:52.734 --> 15:54.214
I'm alive?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.654
Hello.

15:59.697 --> 16:02.135
I'm Dr. Karloff.

16:09.794 --> 16:14.495
This place was always thought
to be haunted.

16:17.802 --> 16:21.545
I understand now
what happened to me.

16:21.589 --> 16:24.418
I... I was turned and became
one of them.

16:24.461 --> 16:26.724
Without even realizing it.

16:32.730 --> 16:35.733
You saved me.

16:35.777 --> 16:39.563
Thank you very much,
young lady.

16:41.261 --> 16:45.091
So you have no knowledge
of an artifact being here?

16:45.134 --> 16:47.745
Other than the storage rooms
that run beneath the facility

16:47.789 --> 16:52.924
or the- the attic,
perhaps, but...

16:52.968 --> 16:57.929
no, no, um, I have never heard
of any sort of special um,

16:57.973 --> 16:59.105
what- what is it?

16:59.148 --> 17:00.628
A- an antique?

17:00.671 --> 17:01.759
That's a very good question.

17:01.803 --> 17:02.673
Uh, what is it?

17:02.717 --> 17:04.893
Remind us?

17:04.936 --> 17:07.026
When you see it you will know.

17:07.069 --> 17:08.070
Oh my god.

17:08.114 --> 17:10.507
You are absolutely useless.

17:10.551 --> 17:12.205
Pledge to us, it says.

17:12.248 --> 17:14.294
Pledge to get in
our goddamn way, apparently.

17:14.337 --> 17:15.817
All will become clear to you.

17:15.860 --> 17:18.080
Oh my god. Shut your mouth.

17:18.124 --> 17:20.996
So, no totem,

17:21.040 --> 17:24.739
no mention of anything to do
with a Van Helsing or-

17:24.782 --> 17:26.784
What?

17:26.828 --> 17:28.830
Van Helsings?

17:28.873 --> 17:30.136
Oh, no.

17:30.179 --> 17:33.487
That's- that's a very
different story.

17:33.530 --> 17:38.057
We had a Van Helsing stay here
around the turn of the century.

17:38.535 --> 17:42.278
A woman who, if I...

17:42.322 --> 17:45.412
I believe if I remember
the story correctly...

17:45.455 --> 17:46.935
yes, yes.

17:46.978 --> 17:48.806
She died here.

17:48.850 --> 17:51.679
Under very mysterious
circumstances.

17:51.722 --> 17:54.508
Very mysterious.

17:54.551 --> 17:56.597
Did I- did I say something
wrong?

18:02.646 --> 18:03.560
You really think she's ok?

18:03.604 --> 18:04.735
She seems way off to me.

18:04.779 --> 18:05.649
Yeah, I know.

18:05.693 --> 18:07.086
She's always been a tough ass,

18:07.129 --> 18:09.784
but... either they did something
to her at that place

18:09.827 --> 18:11.351
or she's becoming more-

18:11.394 --> 18:12.352
Yeah.

18:14.963 --> 18:16.660
You didn't say anything
to her about us, did you?

18:16.704 --> 18:18.314
What? God, no.

18:18.358 --> 18:19.837
No. I would never do that.

18:19.881 --> 18:21.535
This is... our business,
you know?

18:21.578 --> 18:23.798
Lucky these files
were in a sealed room.

18:23.841 --> 18:26.583
But they're so old,

18:26.627 --> 18:29.934
I don't even know if they're
going to be legible.

18:29.978 --> 18:32.154
Best let me handle this,
young man,

18:32.198 --> 18:33.808
as I know what
we're looking for.

18:33.851 --> 18:34.765
Ok.

18:34.809 --> 18:35.897
But, you know, I can read.

18:35.940 --> 18:38.552
Just let us look, ok?

18:38.595 --> 18:40.684
Alright, I was
just trying to help.

18:40.728 --> 18:42.991
I just wanna get out of here
and find the totems

18:43.034 --> 18:44.514
so leave us alone
for a second.

18:44.558 --> 18:45.863
Yeah, I was just trying
to be useful.

18:45.907 --> 18:47.126
But you're not, so...

18:47.169 --> 18:49.128
Ok, Nancy Drew,

18:49.171 --> 18:50.433
so you're the only one
that can find the clues now,
is that how it works?

18:50.477 --> 18:52.131
Look Axel, it doesn't
concern you.

18:52.174 --> 18:54.307
It doesn't concern me?

18:54.350 --> 18:57.136
What have I been doing
for the last four years?

18:57.179 --> 18:58.746
What is going on with you?

18:58.789 --> 19:02.750
You've been acting weird ever
since we met up at Blak Tec.

19:02.793 --> 19:04.230
And now you're, like,
just gonna-

19:04.273 --> 19:07.450
[chewing]

19:08.190 --> 19:10.105
Well, now the elder thing
is eating spiders,

19:10.149 --> 19:11.759
so that's happening.

19:11.802 --> 19:14.457
I mean, this is insane.

19:14.501 --> 19:16.285
I think I found something.

19:20.985 --> 19:21.725
Wow.

19:21.769 --> 19:22.509
Look at her.

19:22.552 --> 19:24.032
She's really lovely.

19:24.075 --> 19:25.338
Delicate.

19:25.381 --> 19:27.427
Yeah, she's nice-looking.

19:27.470 --> 19:30.038
What? She is.

19:30.081 --> 19:31.866
You can definitely
tell she's one of us.

19:31.909 --> 19:33.824
Look at her eyes.

19:33.868 --> 19:36.349
Does it say anything about
what happened to her?

19:36.392 --> 19:37.567
Why she was here?

19:37.611 --> 19:39.221
A list of belongings? Anything?

19:39.265 --> 19:42.703
Ooh, it mentions only that she
was placed here by her husband

19:42.746 --> 19:45.184
for hysteria. Um-

19:45.227 --> 19:47.577
Does it say what happened
to her?

19:47.621 --> 19:53.017
Uh, she- ah, she was placed
in seclusion and- oh, my.

19:53.061 --> 19:56.107
It appears she escaped her cell
on her very first night.

19:56.151 --> 19:57.413
Sounds like a Van Helsing.

19:57.457 --> 19:59.850
[chuckling]

19:59.894 --> 20:01.112
And murdered a guard.

20:01.156 --> 20:02.462
[laughs]

20:02.505 --> 20:04.681
She's uh, it...

20:04.725 --> 20:08.598
just that she was also killed
on the first night here.

20:08.642 --> 20:10.209
Dead on her first night
in the hospital?

20:10.252 --> 20:12.515
Yes, yes. I'm afraid so.

20:12.559 --> 20:15.257
I suppose that's why
I knew the name.

20:15.301 --> 20:19.566
It was a very infamous story.

20:19.609 --> 20:22.003
Ok, well how did she die?

20:22.046 --> 20:25.354
Ah, well, there's nothing
in the original report

20:25.398 --> 20:27.965
but um, let's see.

20:28.009 --> 20:29.358
Ah.

20:29.402 --> 20:33.101
In the medical report
it mentions... yes, here.

20:33.144 --> 20:34.581
Ah.

20:34.624 --> 20:38.193
Bruising to the face and body,
extensive brain damage.

20:38.237 --> 20:42.589
Yes, she had a brain trauma
of some sort and-

20:42.632 --> 20:49.465
and her head was also then caved
in, as if she had been-

20:49.509 --> 20:50.292
Yeah, ok, we get it.

20:50.336 --> 20:50.988
She was dead.

20:51.032 --> 20:51.728
Alright, alright.

20:51.772 --> 20:53.556
Yes, oh yes. Very dead.

20:55.515 --> 20:57.691
On her first night
in the hospital.

20:57.734 --> 21:01.477
So... she killed someone
and then she dies-

21:01.521 --> 21:04.306
was murdered, obviously.

21:04.350 --> 21:07.135
That doesn't make any sense.

21:08.789 --> 21:10.791
Unless her brain...

21:12.749 --> 21:13.750
her brain.

21:17.014 --> 21:18.320
Is she buried here?

21:18.364 --> 21:20.061
Is she buried here or elsewhere?

21:20.104 --> 21:22.542
Um... here.

21:22.585 --> 21:26.023
In Potter's Field, in front
of the facility

21:26.067 --> 21:28.765
where most of the patients
were buried at that time.

21:28.809 --> 21:29.723
Most were.

21:29.766 --> 21:30.985
Ok, where -

21:31.028 --> 21:35.511
Um... plot 46.

21:39.689 --> 21:41.517
Uh, you better come
with us, Doc.

21:41.561 --> 21:42.692
You're still not coming.

21:42.736 --> 21:44.694
Stay.

22:04.714 --> 22:06.150
You're gonna dig that all out
with your knife?

22:06.194 --> 22:07.456
Is that the plan?

22:07.500 --> 22:09.110
Unless you got a better idea.

22:09.153 --> 22:10.590
Or a shovel, maybe?

22:11.721 --> 22:13.375
No?

22:13.419 --> 22:15.421
Ok.

22:15.464 --> 22:16.813
You could help if you want.

22:16.857 --> 22:19.033
There should be shovels,
that sort of thing,

22:19.076 --> 22:21.427
where the groundskeeper
was housed.

22:21.470 --> 22:22.558
Tools.

22:22.602 --> 22:24.821
Alright, alright.
I'll go, I'll go.

22:24.865 --> 22:26.910
Come on, Doc.
Show me where it's at.

22:26.954 --> 22:28.912
This way.

22:35.397 --> 22:38.531
So I guess we should
probably-

22:38.574 --> 22:39.662
We can just dig.

22:39.706 --> 22:42.186
We don't have to talk.

22:56.636 --> 22:59.639
What a beautiful night.

22:59.682 --> 23:00.988
If you say so, Doc.

23:01.031 --> 23:03.294
[chuckles]

23:11.564 --> 23:14.088
My oh my.

23:14.131 --> 23:18.397
What is this place, Doc?

23:18.440 --> 23:21.269
Doesn't look like there's a
whole lot of shovels in here.

23:21.312 --> 23:23.227
No, but there's this.

23:23.271 --> 23:24.968
[clang]

23:29.799 --> 23:31.932
[laughs]

23:36.458 --> 23:39.243
[humming]

23:39.287 --> 23:41.942
[groans]

23:48.165 --> 23:50.037
Hey, hey.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.821
Doc, what the hell
is going on here?

23:51.865 --> 23:53.475
Doc?

23:53.519 --> 23:55.912
What's happening?

23:55.956 --> 23:57.871
We gotta get back upstairs
to the girls, right?

23:57.914 --> 24:00.003
Get the shovels,
find the antique.

24:00.047 --> 24:01.091
Ha!

24:01.135 --> 24:04.094
I haven't done this
in so, so long.

24:04.138 --> 24:05.139
Done what?

24:05.182 --> 24:06.706
This.

24:06.749 --> 24:10.623
The same principle that
the vampires used on me.

24:10.666 --> 24:13.843
Sucked the life right out of me.

24:13.887 --> 24:16.672
Literally right out of my body.

24:16.716 --> 24:19.327
They said I was a patient

24:19.370 --> 24:20.981
You were a patient?

24:21.024 --> 24:22.591
[laughs] But I knew better,
than that.

24:22.635 --> 24:24.506
Yes, I did.

24:24.550 --> 24:27.509
I waited. I waited
'til I got my chance

24:27.553 --> 24:29.555
and then I killed them all.
Ha!

24:29.598 --> 24:31.295
Didn't I not kill them all?
Yes, I did.

24:31.339 --> 24:34.821
And then I let all the rest
go free.

24:34.864 --> 24:37.301
What a time that was.

24:37.345 --> 24:39.347
It was a sweet, sweet time.

24:41.175 --> 24:45.919
The vampires came and turned us.

24:49.575 --> 24:51.664
And they sucked the life-

24:51.707 --> 24:52.708
Easy now.

24:52.752 --> 24:54.014
Right out of our brains.

24:54.057 --> 24:55.145
No, no, wait a second. No, no-

24:55.189 --> 24:59.236
[groaning]

25:02.762 --> 25:06.287
[laughing]

25:23.652 --> 25:24.435
Where's Axel?

25:24.479 --> 25:25.611
He should be back by now.

25:25.654 --> 25:27.482
I don't know.

25:27.526 --> 25:30.877
Do you want me to go
look for him?

25:30.920 --> 25:33.532
Of course you'd volunteer
for that.

25:33.575 --> 25:37.536
What's that supposed to mean?

25:37.579 --> 25:38.493
Forget it.

25:38.537 --> 25:39.842
Ok.

25:39.886 --> 25:41.322
You need to give it a rest.

25:41.365 --> 25:44.107
Axel and I are not a thing.

25:44.151 --> 25:48.111
Ok, we had a moment,
you know, and we were- whatever.

25:48.155 --> 25:50.244
Look, I'm- I'm sorry if
I'm stepping on territory

25:50.287 --> 25:52.463
that you're interested in-

25:52.507 --> 25:57.294
I'm not interested in
the marine, I promise you.

25:57.338 --> 26:00.515
I'm trying to stop
an apocalypse.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.952
So I'm not really dating
right now.

26:02.996 --> 26:04.867
Oh, ok.

26:04.911 --> 26:09.393
Ok, well maybe you can explain
the group shower.

26:09.437 --> 26:10.394
What?

26:10.438 --> 26:13.267
I'm just curious.

26:13.310 --> 26:15.486
He told you about that?

26:18.794 --> 26:19.708
Ok.

26:19.752 --> 26:21.405
That was because
of the hospital,

26:21.449 --> 26:23.059
there was a water shortage.

26:23.103 --> 26:25.279
Mmm.

26:25.322 --> 26:26.759
Hey.

26:26.802 --> 26:30.327
He walked in on me and I pointed
a rifle at him.

26:30.371 --> 26:32.765
He mention that?

26:32.808 --> 26:34.418
Should go ask him
if you want to.

26:34.462 --> 26:35.811
You're the one who brought
him up.

26:35.855 --> 26:37.421
Yeah, because I thought
he should be back by now.

26:37.465 --> 26:39.685
Ok, well then go
and find him yourself,

26:39.728 --> 26:42.122
or get the elder
to go get him.

26:42.165 --> 26:43.558
God, I'll just keep doing this.

26:43.602 --> 26:44.864
I'm used to it, anyway.

26:44.907 --> 26:45.908
What?

26:45.952 --> 26:47.301
Grave robbing.

26:47.344 --> 26:48.607
What does that mean?

26:48.650 --> 26:50.391
Look, you don't know a goddamn
thing about me,

26:50.434 --> 26:51.653
'cause you never talk.

26:51.697 --> 26:53.002
Yeah, we've been kinda busy
since we met.

26:53.046 --> 26:54.482
So what?

26:54.525 --> 26:56.963
We're sisters.

26:59.269 --> 27:01.663
Apparently that doesn't mean
anything to you.

27:01.707 --> 27:03.534
Where is all this coming from?

27:03.578 --> 27:05.580
I have done nothing but try
to get through to you

27:05.624 --> 27:09.149
since day one and you have been
consistently shutting me down.

27:09.192 --> 27:10.324
That's not true.

27:10.367 --> 27:14.502
At least we were civil
when we met.

27:14.545 --> 27:17.331
What happened to you?

27:17.374 --> 27:20.290
What did that guy do to you?

27:20.334 --> 27:21.596
Vanessa?

27:21.640 --> 27:23.076
What's going on with you?

27:23.119 --> 27:25.513
I don't know what's
going on with me!

27:32.999 --> 27:38.134
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

27:38.178 --> 27:41.616
I don't know what's going on
with me.

27:46.752 --> 27:51.234
But you're right, something is.

27:51.278 --> 27:56.152
Ever since the elder woke me,
bit me.

27:56.196 --> 27:57.632
What?

27:57.676 --> 27:59.155
He bit you?

28:03.377 --> 28:07.163
Before you know- I'd use blood
to kinda like get revved up

28:07.207 --> 28:10.166
or to track people,
that kinda thing.

28:10.210 --> 28:11.690
Ok.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.866
But now...

28:21.134 --> 28:23.571
I'm craving it.

28:33.624 --> 28:41.589
If I start to turn you know what
you have to do, right?

28:41.632 --> 28:42.764
You're fine.

28:42.808 --> 28:43.852
You- you're gonna be fine.

28:43.896 --> 28:48.901
Whatever happens
we'll figure it out.

28:51.991 --> 28:53.427
[thunk]

29:04.481 --> 29:06.483
[gasps]

29:08.137 --> 29:12.663
Where are you, my happy
little friend?

29:14.970 --> 29:18.669
You are a very special
young man.

29:18.713 --> 29:21.237
Because of that
we're going to need

29:21.281 --> 29:25.241
a very special set of tools.

29:25.285 --> 29:29.202
[grunts]

29:30.290 --> 29:33.728
These little friends
will do the trick.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.687
Help me take your mind.

29:51.833 --> 29:52.573
There's nothing here.

29:52.616 --> 29:54.618
It's a man.

29:54.662 --> 29:56.098
It's not Lilly.

29:56.142 --> 29:58.013
Yeah, but the record said
that it was gonna be here.

29:58.057 --> 29:59.667
Yeah, obviously the records
were wrong.

29:59.710 --> 30:01.321
I mean, one number
could be off and then...

30:01.364 --> 30:02.148
Oh, great.

30:02.191 --> 30:02.931
Yeah, that's great.

30:02.975 --> 30:03.932
So now what then?

30:03.976 --> 30:06.195
So is it 47 or is it 45?

30:06.239 --> 30:07.718
Worse, what if it's
the first number?

30:07.762 --> 30:09.155
What, are we supposed
to be in the 30's?

30:09.198 --> 30:10.112
The 20's?

30:10.156 --> 30:11.026
I mean, this is shit.

30:11.070 --> 30:12.332
Well, we could keep digging

30:12.375 --> 30:14.421
or we could go back in
and check the records.

30:14.464 --> 30:16.945
I mean, whatever you wanna do.

30:16.989 --> 30:21.645
What do you wanna do?

30:21.689 --> 30:24.648
I- I guess I think
we should wait.

30:24.692 --> 30:25.911
You know, 'cause
if we go in there,

30:25.954 --> 30:27.521
they come looking for us
and we're not here

30:27.564 --> 30:29.523
then they're gonna go inside
there trying to find us

30:29.566 --> 30:31.133
and we're gonna be out here,
we're not gonna find-

30:31.177 --> 30:33.527
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ok. Ok.

30:33.570 --> 30:37.879
You're right. We wait.

30:37.923 --> 30:39.620
Ok.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.856
Perfect.

30:57.899 --> 31:00.075
I hope your friends are enjoying
their search out there

31:00.119 --> 31:01.685
in the cold.

31:01.729 --> 31:03.339
Why do you say that?

31:03.383 --> 31:07.648
Well, to be fair I did send them
on a bit of a wild goose chase.

31:07.691 --> 31:09.563
In the cemetery?

31:09.606 --> 31:11.478
The Van Helsing woman
I knew of,

31:11.521 --> 31:13.349
she was a very wealthy woman.

31:13.393 --> 31:16.526
She would never have been
buried outside.

31:16.570 --> 31:17.440
I don't understand-

31:17.484 --> 31:19.442
You don't have to understand.

31:19.486 --> 31:21.662
In a few minutes nothing's
gonna matter to you.

31:21.705 --> 31:23.794
[laughs]

31:23.838 --> 31:24.926
No, no, I get that.

31:24.970 --> 31:28.147
I just- I'm just curious.

31:28.190 --> 31:29.931
Where would she be buried?

31:29.975 --> 31:31.367
Below.

31:31.411 --> 31:32.412
Below?

31:32.455 --> 31:33.892
Below.

31:33.935 --> 31:37.069
In the mausoleum.

31:38.418 --> 31:42.813
That's where everybody
of means was interred. Yeah?

31:42.857 --> 31:44.076
Ah.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.340
[groans]

31:48.080 --> 31:57.132
[grunts]

31:59.874 --> 32:02.616
Ugh, god!

32:02.659 --> 32:04.879
Not so smart anymore,
are ya, Doc?

32:04.923 --> 32:06.489
Ulgh!

32:08.143 --> 32:09.971
Hey!

32:10.015 --> 32:12.017
Hey!

32:18.197 --> 32:19.372
Where's the doctor?

32:19.415 --> 32:23.028
Uh, yeah, he's kinda dead.

32:23.071 --> 32:25.160
So what, the whole "help us"
thing was sort of...

32:25.204 --> 32:26.074
Pretty much.

32:26.118 --> 32:27.467
Right.

32:27.510 --> 32:30.122
Yeah, forget about him
and forget about out here.

32:30.165 --> 32:31.123
She's not buried out here,

32:31.166 --> 32:33.212
I got that much outta
the guy.

32:33.255 --> 32:36.911
She's inside in the mausoleum.

32:39.044 --> 32:40.349
Are you alright?

32:40.393 --> 32:43.570
Yeah, you know, for almost
getting a lobotomy.

32:43.613 --> 32:45.572
Shit.

32:54.711 --> 32:56.409
Watch your backs.

32:57.323 --> 32:58.628
I don't like this.

32:58.672 --> 32:59.673
Really?

33:16.124 --> 33:17.212
Look as fast as you can,

33:17.256 --> 33:19.258
I don't like the feeling
of this place.

33:19.301 --> 33:21.521
Yeah, me neither,
Sleeping Beauty.

33:22.522 --> 33:24.089
It's alright.

33:24.132 --> 33:28.528
Oh, you feel that?

33:28.571 --> 33:30.834
It's the same shit
from upstairs.

33:30.878 --> 33:32.488
[groans]

33:32.532 --> 33:34.316
It's worse.

33:35.796 --> 33:36.840
It's here.

33:36.884 --> 33:38.886
What?

33:38.929 --> 33:40.453
The thing that killed Lilly.

33:40.496 --> 33:42.107
Turned all the others in here.

33:42.150 --> 33:43.412
This is where it hides.

33:43.456 --> 33:44.805
[groans]

33:44.848 --> 33:46.372
You gotta get out of here.
It's too strong for you.

33:46.415 --> 33:47.764
No. I wanna fight with you.

33:47.808 --> 33:49.505
No, you need to live and Axel's
not gonna make it.

33:49.549 --> 33:50.550
Get him out of here.

33:50.593 --> 33:53.031
Ok? Go.

33:53.074 --> 33:54.641
Get the elder and send it to me.

33:54.684 --> 33:55.337
Ok.

33:55.381 --> 33:56.034
Ok, come on.

33:56.077 --> 33:56.904
Go!

33:56.947 --> 33:57.644
Ok.

33:57.687 --> 33:59.646
Come on, let's go.

34:19.927 --> 34:24.149
Another vampire killer
with a pretty face.

34:24.192 --> 34:26.064
That's right.

34:26.107 --> 34:27.674
You'll never meet another one
like me,

34:27.717 --> 34:30.068
I'll promise you that.

34:30.111 --> 34:32.940
Such bravado.

34:32.983 --> 34:34.768
Such hubris.

34:34.811 --> 34:35.812
That's right.

34:35.856 --> 34:39.642
Keep talking.

34:39.686 --> 34:46.649
Already your energy
is becoming mine,

34:46.693 --> 34:51.611
even one as strong as you.

34:51.654 --> 34:52.873
Yeah, that's alright.

34:52.916 --> 34:57.007
There's plenty more
where that came from.

34:57.051 --> 34:59.009
I'm a Van Helsing.

34:59.053 --> 35:01.534
Yes.

35:01.577 --> 35:04.363
I thought as much.

35:04.406 --> 35:09.411
I've watched your kind
die before.

35:09.455 --> 35:11.892
Keep talking.

35:11.935 --> 35:14.808
Right up until I kill you.

35:28.300 --> 35:32.826
[gun shots]

35:39.224 --> 35:41.530
[groans]

35:43.837 --> 35:53.847
Even one with powers as great
as yours will not go forward.

35:57.329 --> 35:59.896
You can't stop me.

36:11.212 --> 36:16.913
Such great powers.

36:16.957 --> 36:23.877
But you also carry
a great anger.

36:23.920 --> 36:26.184
A sadness.

36:32.625 --> 36:34.453
[roars]

36:48.031 --> 36:50.643
Doesn't matter.

36:50.686 --> 36:53.820
I don't have to fight you
on my own.

36:53.863 --> 36:56.823
And why might that be?

36:57.389 --> 36:58.738
Attack.

36:58.781 --> 37:00.827
[roars]

37:07.790 --> 37:10.880
[cries out]

37:35.078 --> 37:37.124
That's so strange.

37:37.167 --> 37:40.432
She looks like
she died yesterday.

37:40.475 --> 37:42.085
That's amazing.

37:42.129 --> 37:44.305
Knowing she was one of us?

37:44.349 --> 37:45.872
Fought them like we do?

37:45.915 --> 37:48.309
I mean, she must have come here
to kill the thing

37:48.353 --> 37:50.050
and then lost her life to it.

37:50.093 --> 37:52.444
Probably had herself committed
to get inside.

37:52.487 --> 37:54.881
That's amazing.

37:54.924 --> 37:57.797
Ladies, I'm about done
with this creepy little dungeon

37:57.840 --> 37:59.102
so if we could get
a move on.

37:59.146 --> 38:00.800
Ok.

38:07.154 --> 38:08.286
Woah.

38:08.329 --> 38:09.156
That's beautiful.

38:09.199 --> 38:10.070
My totem!

38:10.113 --> 38:11.506
Back off!

38:11.550 --> 38:13.682
Do not forget your place.

38:13.726 --> 38:14.857
Give it back to me.

38:14.901 --> 38:17.120
It's mine.

38:17.164 --> 38:19.732
Yeah, like I said,
can we get going?

38:19.775 --> 38:22.517
Ok, the elder and I
will close Lilly's coffin.

38:22.561 --> 38:24.214
Why don't you two go check
the trail,

38:24.258 --> 38:26.913
see if it's still passable
after the storm?

38:26.956 --> 38:28.958
Why, because someone ate
our guide?

38:29.002 --> 38:31.787
Because of that?

38:33.746 --> 38:35.574
Don't take too long.

38:37.097 --> 38:38.664
Axel.

38:43.277 --> 38:46.541
I'll tell you later.

38:46.585 --> 38:48.108
Ok.

38:58.423 --> 39:00.642
Move away from it, Vanessa.

39:00.686 --> 39:05.168
Close the lid and return it to
its resting place, I beg you.

39:05.212 --> 39:06.082
What're you talking about?

39:06.126 --> 39:07.780
Do not touch it.

39:09.216 --> 39:10.957
Do not go near it.

39:12.567 --> 39:14.177
What?

39:17.529 --> 39:18.399
This?

39:18.443 --> 39:22.055
Yes.

39:22.098 --> 39:25.537
It must have had contact
with an elder.

39:25.580 --> 39:26.842
See the stains?

39:26.886 --> 39:27.887
Blood.

39:31.804 --> 39:34.546
She must have fought the B'ah
at some point in her short life.

39:34.589 --> 39:35.416
What's the B'ah?

39:35.460 --> 39:38.463
Not what, but who.

39:38.506 --> 39:41.988
My child, you still have
so much to learn.

39:42.031 --> 39:44.164
So, so much.

39:44.207 --> 39:48.037
Even a great vampire hunter
like yourself.

39:50.475 --> 39:54.783
So, are we gonna talk about
the red eye thing or not?

39:54.827 --> 39:56.350
Are you kidding me?

39:56.394 --> 39:58.396
How about we wait 'til day time?

40:00.223 --> 40:01.921
Baby.

40:01.964 --> 40:03.357
I'm not a baby, I'm a marine.

40:03.401 --> 40:04.227
Mmm.

40:04.271 --> 40:05.315
Ok.

40:05.359 --> 40:06.621
A marine who's afraid
of the dark.

40:06.665 --> 40:08.884
Shut up, I'm not afraid.

40:16.239 --> 40:17.676
[choking]

40:17.719 --> 40:20.113
Answer my goddamn question.

40:20.156 --> 40:21.680
Oh, good.

40:21.723 --> 40:23.333
Good.

40:23.377 --> 40:25.248
Very good.

40:25.292 --> 40:28.643
Rarely have I seen such anger
in a human.

40:28.687 --> 40:32.517
So much, in fact, it nearly
got you killed.

40:34.867 --> 40:35.824
Back off.

40:35.868 --> 40:37.347
I cannot.

40:37.391 --> 40:40.612
I serve you so I must
stay close.

40:40.655 --> 40:42.657
For now.

40:48.533 --> 40:51.492
The B'ah is one of the great
elders you will face

40:51.536 --> 40:54.669
and for that there is much
you don't understand.

40:54.713 --> 40:56.236
You nearly lost this battle.

40:56.279 --> 40:57.977
You are not yet ready to face
the strength of an elder,

40:58.020 --> 41:02.285
certainly not an elder
like the B'ah.

41:02.329 --> 41:03.896
Then teach me.

41:03.939 --> 41:05.375
No.

41:06.986 --> 41:09.162
Better still, I will show you.
