WEBVTT

00:01.750 --> 00:04.358
Ha, you saw them, they wanna kill her!

00:04.383 --> 00:06.671
We had a deal. I got
you the conjugal visits.

00:06.696 --> 00:08.762
Make it clear, that
Ferguson is off limits.

00:08.787 --> 00:10.074
If you'd be willing to

00:10.099 --> 00:13.128
- guarantee my safety...
- Guarantee your safety?

00:13.209 --> 00:14.891
Oh! I've been approved.

00:14.916 --> 00:16.610
- Who with?
- Daz.

00:16.635 --> 00:18.390
But you're not even with Daz, love.

00:18.415 --> 00:19.713
Why would they reject me?

00:19.738 --> 00:22.750
A whole bunch of other women are getting
conjugals. I should have been approved.

00:22.775 --> 00:23.870
You can feel it?

00:23.895 --> 00:25.837
I'll send you to the
hospital for a mammogram.

00:25.862 --> 00:28.225
Has anybody told you what
really happened in the fire?

00:28.250 --> 00:31.405
I couldn't save Warner,
but I did save your son.

00:31.665 --> 00:33.542
Sex has never really been my...

00:33.567 --> 00:35.735
Well, maybe you've been doin'
it with the wrong people.

00:36.070 --> 00:37.270
Maybe.

00:37.295 --> 00:39.475
I know the women want
their pound of flesh.

00:39.500 --> 00:40.912
You want me to bash you?

00:40.937 --> 00:42.741
Give the women what they want.

00:47.443 --> 00:48.950
You gonna kill me,

00:48.975 --> 00:50.490
or help me?

00:51.092 --> 00:52.588
I'll protect you.

Ah-ha!

02:10.530 --> 02:12.907
Shh-sh-sh-sh, it's okay.

02:13.163 --> 02:14.681
It's okay.

02:17.976 --> 02:19.214
Just tell me, Joan.

02:20.465 --> 02:22.372
Just tell me who did this to you.

02:24.679 --> 02:26.428
Shh-sh, it's okay.

02:33.266 --> 02:34.594
It's okay.

02:37.520 --> 02:39.279
Okay, here they are. Okay

02:51.455 --> 02:53.121
- Was it Bea Smith?

02:54.551 --> 02:56.397
It wasn't Bea Smith.

03:23.591 --> 03:24.935
Kaz?

03:25.543 --> 03:26.750
Kaz?

03:28.942 --> 03:30.150
Go to bed.

03:30.702 --> 03:32.593
You've done all you can for her.

03:33.361 --> 03:34.569
Come on.

03:38.816 --> 03:42.101
What kind of woman does
that to another woman?

03:42.911 --> 03:44.966
Well, they're not all like you, Kaz.

03:44.991 --> 03:47.109
Some of 'em are just fuckin' arseholes.

03:48.063 --> 03:49.479
We are in prison.

03:52.377 --> 03:55.222
No one should suffer, like Joan is.

03:57.218 --> 04:00.158
No one deserves to be raped.

04:06.086 --> 04:07.688
Someone has to pay.

04:30.976 --> 04:32.183
<i>Joan...</i>

04:34.124 --> 04:36.112
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

04:36.137 --> 04:37.641
Oh!

04:39.155 --> 04:40.991
Just get me a fresh pair, please.

04:45.135 --> 04:46.509
Are you all right?

04:48.129 --> 04:49.337
Okay.

04:53.472 --> 04:55.623
<i>Prepare to
go outside for count.</i>

04:59.460 --> 05:00.668
Come on!

05:09.818 --> 05:11.026
<i>Attention compound,</i>

05:11.051 --> 05:12.748
- <i>attention compound. T-block</i>
- Barrett.

05:12.773 --> 05:15.698
- <i>now called to breakfast.</i>
- Novak. Proctor.

05:16.878 --> 05:18.085
Ferguson.

05:18.110 --> 05:20.616
...Joan Ferguson.

05:22.372 --> 05:23.580
Ferguson?

05:23.605 --> 05:27.419
<i>Attention compound, attention compound.
D-block are now called for breakfast.</i>

05:36.885 --> 05:41.914
<i>Attention compound, attention compound.
H-block are now called to breakfast.</i>

05:43.485 --> 05:44.940
What's happened to Proctor's crew?

05:44.965 --> 05:46.886
- Weird, isn't it?
- Mm.

05:46.911 --> 05:48.681
Maybe she killed 'em in their sleep.

05:48.886 --> 05:50.126
And then ate them.

05:50.514 --> 05:51.720
Not funny.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.227
So...

05:54.312 --> 05:57.354
real sorry but I'm gonna
have to bail on laundry duty

05:57.379 --> 05:58.927
- tomorrow, eh?
- Mm, right.

05:59.169 --> 06:00.562
And I said cannibalising, eh?

06:00.587 --> 06:02.256
- You wanna know why?
- Can we put Miss Kaz on her?

06:02.288 --> 06:03.496
Yeah!

06:03.521 --> 06:05.884
- You wanna know why?!
- Why, Booms?

06:05.909 --> 06:08.674
'Cause I'm gonna be
rootin' Daz all arvo.

06:08.700 --> 06:10.563
- What?
- Conjugals are back on!

06:10.588 --> 06:11.876
How are they back on?

06:12.254 --> 06:14.029
Oh, well, 'cause, ah...

06:14.054 --> 06:17.065
Kel, from J-block, you
know, she got the blame for

06:17.091 --> 06:18.864
cue-ballin' Mr. Lawson, so...

06:18.889 --> 06:21.452
Yeah, with a bit of your
encouragement, Booms?

06:21.477 --> 06:22.684
No.

06:22.923 --> 06:24.195
- Hm?
- What?

06:24.220 --> 06:26.706
How about I do your make-up
and Bea does your hair?

06:26.732 --> 06:28.851
- Oh, yeah! Oh, do you reckon?
- Mm-hm.

06:28.876 --> 06:31.755
Oh, yeah, but don't do it like last time, eh?

06:31.981 --> 06:33.261
'Cause actually it took ages to

06:33.287 --> 06:35.479
- wear off, so I don't want that.

06:35.504 --> 06:37.067
- Okay. Don't... don't get...
- Guaranteed, it won't be

06:37.092 --> 06:38.300
like last time.

06:38.325 --> 06:40.574
- What do you think you might do?
- Booms, Booms...

06:40.599 --> 06:43.086
just remember, she
got knocked back, yeah?

06:43.111 --> 06:45.684
- Yeah, well, that's not my fault.
- I know it's not your fault,

06:45.709 --> 06:47.803
but try and have some understanding.

06:49.285 --> 06:54.568
Hey, Dors, you can do somethin' too, you
could like iron my pants or somethin'.

06:54.592 --> 06:56.782
Iron your pants,
it'd take a fuckin' week.

06:57.912 --> 07:01.137
- You all right, love?
- She's not even with Daz.

07:01.163 --> 07:03.385
- Everyone knows that.
- I know, love, I'm sorry.

07:03.410 --> 07:07.242
Oh, well, Nash is the father of
my child and it's so unfair...!

07:18.918 --> 07:20.614
You are kidding me.

07:23.553 --> 07:24.761
Doreen.

07:30.438 --> 07:31.647
Freak!

07:35.678 --> 07:36.886
<i>Freak!</i>

07:38.563 --> 07:39.770
<i>Freak!</i>

07:42.423 --> 07:44.207
Freak!

07:47.346 --> 07:48.554
Ignore them.

07:50.060 --> 07:51.781
All right, settle down!

07:53.943 --> 07:56.408
Settle down now, or I'll
slot every one of you!

08:03.238 --> 08:04.446
Serve this woman!

08:15.399 --> 08:16.925
So, what's she doin'?

08:17.280 --> 08:18.890
She in their crew now?

08:25.578 --> 08:27.473
I thought she was takin'
her meals in her cell.

08:27.692 --> 08:29.008
Apparently not.

08:29.033 --> 08:30.355
So sorry.

08:31.753 --> 08:33.057
Sorry I have to go.

08:35.264 --> 08:36.472
I'm sorry!

08:37.070 --> 08:39.594
Go on, ya fuckin' psycho!

08:51.695 --> 08:52.903
I'm out.

09:00.316 --> 09:01.726
Hey, what's going on?

09:02.101 --> 09:03.308
What?

09:03.333 --> 09:05.063
What are you doing protecting her?

09:05.491 --> 09:08.422
Yeah, you know Kaz, gotta help a sister.

09:08.447 --> 09:09.655
Sister?

09:09.680 --> 09:11.359
She's not her sister.

09:13.101 --> 09:16.427
She was attacked, pretty badly.

09:18.451 --> 09:21.599
- Did she say who did it?
- Nah. She won't talk about it.

09:22.386 --> 09:23.593
Listen to me...

09:24.557 --> 09:28.791
that woman is a psychopath, you gotta
back away right now. Don't help her out.

09:29.548 --> 09:34.055
If she asks you to do anything, anything
at all, just report it to me, okay?

09:35.598 --> 09:38.200
She's like 50 and she
can barely move.

09:38.225 --> 09:39.606
I think we can handle her.

09:40.738 --> 09:42.588
You got no idea.

09:44.992 --> 09:46.950
We need to find out who did the attack.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.237
Find out who wasn't
at breakfast yesterday.

10:00.419 --> 10:02.306
Just breathe, all right, it's all right.

10:02.331 --> 10:03.568
- It's all right.

10:05.888 --> 10:08.191
Shh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh.

10:09.080 --> 10:11.462
Shhh. Joan, look at me.

10:11.606 --> 10:13.270
- Look at me.

10:15.350 --> 10:17.317
Will Jackson did this to you, didn't he?

10:19.948 --> 10:21.155
Didn't he?

10:23.436 --> 10:24.668
Shit!

10:26.875 --> 10:29.997
He... he just needed
to assert his power.

10:30.116 --> 10:32.395
It's done now, that'll
be the end of it.

10:32.524 --> 10:34.894
- No. He needs to be dealt with.
- Please, please, please,

10:34.919 --> 10:36.266
do not say anything.

10:36.355 --> 10:39.378
If they know that I've been attacked
they will send me back into protection.

10:41.173 --> 10:42.581
There I'm at their mercy.

10:43.092 --> 10:44.301
Back away!

10:47.396 --> 10:50.236
I know this is terrifying
but we can protect you and we

10:50.262 --> 10:52.187
- can take him on.
- Oh, no. No, no, no no, no.

10:52.212 --> 10:54.401
There's strength in numbers, Joan.

10:54.730 --> 10:56.316
Haven't you worked it out yet?

10:57.821 --> 10:59.874
Will Jackson and Bea Smith...

11:00.842 --> 11:04.063
it's how she survived,
how she rose to power.

11:08.598 --> 11:10.289
When I began at Wentworth...

11:10.549 --> 11:13.840
I heard the rumours. I tried to
expose them but I never succeeded.

11:15.743 --> 11:16.953
If I had...

11:17.736 --> 11:19.808
neither of us would be here right now.

11:19.833 --> 11:21.040
Ferguson!

11:21.355 --> 11:22.628
Piss off!

11:22.773 --> 11:25.825
Pull your head in, Proctor. You've
got a meeting with your lawyer.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.558
- Maxine...
- Hello.

11:49.947 --> 11:52.845
- How have you been?
- Oh, I'm okay.

11:54.142 --> 11:57.314
Now, I got your results this morning...

11:57.340 --> 12:00.920
- Mm-hmmm.
- and... I'm afraid it's not good news.

12:02.028 --> 12:05.255
The tests indicate
some malignant cells.

12:13.515 --> 12:15.005
Has it spread, or...

12:15.030 --> 12:17.929
Well, that... that's a conversation
best had with the specialist.

12:17.954 --> 12:20.719
Okay, every cancer treatment is unique,

12:20.908 --> 12:23.867
and in your case we need to
consider your course of hormones.

12:23.892 --> 12:25.258
I'll be able to keep taking them,

12:25.283 --> 12:27.319
- my hormones?
- We don't know yet.

12:27.482 --> 12:31.167
Um... some types of breast
cancer are oestrogen-sensitive.

12:32.709 --> 12:34.595
The specialist will be in conversation

12:34.620 --> 12:39.702
with your, uh, endocrinologist
and together they'll devise a plan...

12:49.893 --> 12:51.959
What happened about eating in her unit?

12:52.639 --> 12:55.110
She claimed she had Kaz
Proctor's protection,

12:55.135 --> 12:58.036
- I wanted to see if it was true.
- Well, I would have preferred to know.

13:00.551 --> 13:01.757
Sorry.

13:03.147 --> 13:05.492
How did she manage this so quickly?

13:06.801 --> 13:08.870
<i>Sierra 7 to Sierra 2...</i>

13:10.116 --> 13:11.401
Come in Sierra 7.

13:11.427 --> 13:13.698
<i>Requesting your presence
in the strip-search room.</i>

13:13.723 --> 13:16.166
<i>Prisoner Ferguson is refusing a search.</i>

13:17.348 --> 13:19.438
It was a supervised meeting
with a reputable lawyer,

13:19.463 --> 13:21.116
this is entirely unnecessary.

13:22.715 --> 13:24.253
Remove your clothing...

13:24.963 --> 13:26.170
now.

13:44.275 --> 13:45.705
What happened?

13:45.730 --> 13:47.047
I fell.

13:48.037 --> 13:50.025
Clearly you didn't just fall.

13:50.051 --> 13:51.890
Bathroom tiles are very slippery.

13:52.084 --> 13:54.326
It's filthy in there,
you should look into that.

13:54.504 --> 13:55.709
Underwear.

14:26.077 --> 14:27.283
Turn around.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.741
Bend over.

14:54.807 --> 14:56.192
Who did this to you?

14:56.216 --> 14:57.944
Told you, I fell.

14:58.657 --> 15:01.562
In fact, the prisoners have been
most supportive and sympathetic.

15:02.052 --> 15:04.602
They facilitated my
recovery considerably.

15:04.628 --> 15:05.834
Get dressed.

15:08.659 --> 15:11.241
Call the nurse... now.

15:11.652 --> 15:13.726
Tell her we're bringing
prisoner Ferguson in

15:13.751 --> 15:15.204
for a mandatory medical check.

15:15.229 --> 15:16.762
I'm sure I don't need to remind you

15:16.787 --> 15:20.034
that my permission is required
for an internal examination.

15:22.963 --> 15:26.475
Then you leave me no choice but to
have you sent back to protection.

15:27.139 --> 15:30.402
There are absolutely no
grounds, as it was an accident.

15:33.944 --> 15:36.080
I want to see all
officers in the staff room in

15:36.105 --> 15:37.521
- 20 minutes.
- What's going on, Governor, where's she

15:37.546 --> 15:39.403
- being taken? You all right, Joan?
- Not your problem, Proctor.

15:39.428 --> 15:41.394
She is fine, move on!

15:41.754 --> 15:44.945
<i>It's okay, Joan. If anything
happens to you, we won't stand for it!</i>

15:44.970 --> 15:47.586
- <i>It's okay, we're here!</i>

15:48.209 --> 15:52.174
So you're okay with it, are ya? That
a guard attacked a woman and raped her.

15:52.474 --> 15:54.219
- What?
- You know what I'm talkin' about,

15:54.244 --> 15:55.777
your toy-boy, Will Jackson,

15:55.803 --> 15:58.118
- brutalised Joan Ferguson.
- What?

15:58.487 --> 16:01.034
Oh, it's funny is it,
you're all fuckin' laughing?

16:01.060 --> 16:02.976
- Yeah!
- Is that what she told you?

16:03.110 --> 16:05.382
He didn't do it, trust me.

16:05.407 --> 16:07.935
Yeah, of course you'd
cover for him, screw lover!

16:07.960 --> 16:10.596
- Hey!
- Nah, nah, it's okay, Booms.

16:10.873 --> 16:13.026
Mr. Jackson would never
lay a finger on her.

16:13.266 --> 16:16.721
She's playing you.
I'd watch my back if I was you.

16:17.109 --> 16:18.553
Victim's a liar...?

16:18.578 --> 16:20.117
Fuck, I've never heard that one

16:20.142 --> 16:21.847
- before.
- She's no victim.

16:22.188 --> 16:23.992
You don't know the history of
this place and what she's done.

16:24.017 --> 16:27.318
I know we've got a Top Dog who'd
rather protect the screw she's fucking!

16:28.605 --> 16:30.169
- <i>Whoa-oh!</i>

16:30.194 --> 16:31.403
Yeah!

16:32.988 --> 16:35.027
Oh, yeah, you wanna
fuckin' go, do ya?

16:35.052 --> 16:37.409
You're listening to the
wrong person dickhead!

16:37.434 --> 16:39.464
- All right.
- You wanna bit, yeah?

16:40.836 --> 16:43.383
You see that? She doesn't
give a shit about any of them.

16:43.408 --> 16:46.640
She fucks the screws and
then lets them abuse us!

16:47.592 --> 16:49.611
There's your fuckin' Top Dog...

16:49.801 --> 16:51.300
screw lover!

16:55.875 --> 16:58.057
You can't stick up
for him like that, Bea.

16:58.083 --> 17:01.289
Of course I'm gonna stick up for
him. What Kaz is saying is utter crap!

17:01.314 --> 17:03.831
You've just gotta be careful
how it comes across, Bea,

17:03.856 --> 17:05.314
'cause he is a screw!

17:05.339 --> 17:07.087
Yeah, and she is The Freak!

17:07.112 --> 17:09.239
- What did happen to her?
- Oh, Doreen,

17:09.263 --> 17:12.411
you're always at me. For fuck's sake!

17:13.288 --> 17:14.624
Oh...

17:16.810 --> 17:19.877
- She was ganged.
- Ganged, by who?

17:19.970 --> 17:21.179
Dunno.

17:21.728 --> 17:24.137
But you all know it wasn't
Mr. Jackson, that's bullshit.

17:24.162 --> 17:26.247
Yes, love, we know that...

17:26.271 --> 17:28.531
but you gotta let him
sort it out himself.

17:28.556 --> 17:32.447
You can't be seen defending a screw. You
know there's nothin' worse than that.

17:33.353 --> 17:34.560
Hey...

17:35.396 --> 17:36.605
how'd you go?

17:38.002 --> 17:39.210
Did you find out anything?

17:41.396 --> 17:43.273
The Asian crew didn't know anything.

17:43.478 --> 17:44.704
Well, what about Juice?

17:44.729 --> 17:47.344
Juice was at breakfast,
hon. But I'm on it.

17:57.304 --> 17:58.705
Are you all right?

17:59.224 --> 18:00.765
Did you get your results?

18:01.718 --> 18:03.927
Oh, it was benign.

18:03.964 --> 18:06.978
- Oh, that's great news, Max.
- Yeah.

18:07.004 --> 18:08.854
Great news, and you
gotta do any follow up?

18:08.879 --> 18:10.165
- or...?
- No, none.

18:10.184 --> 18:12.414
Oh, what a relief.

18:12.439 --> 18:14.907
Oh, you are gonna sleep
well tonight, love.

18:14.932 --> 18:16.329
- Yeah.
- Like a baby.

18:16.354 --> 18:18.686
- Great news.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.903
Oh, Ms. Westfall...

18:29.969 --> 18:32.174
I didn't know we had a
scheduled appointment.

18:32.567 --> 18:34.906
Consider this an informal check-in.

18:35.359 --> 18:37.642
I hear you've been injured.

18:38.467 --> 18:39.676
Quite badly.

18:39.701 --> 18:40.907
Minor accident.

18:42.158 --> 18:43.374
I bruise easily.

18:43.400 --> 18:46.481
And how has the
transition to general been?

18:46.802 --> 18:48.385
Quite difficult, I imagine.

18:49.167 --> 18:51.381
Actually, it's been
something of a relief.

18:51.674 --> 18:52.882
Oh, really?

18:54.942 --> 18:56.946
Yeah, it's nice not to
be cooped up all the time.

18:57.607 --> 18:58.875
New company.

18:59.127 --> 19:00.976
It's been quite instructive, seeing my

19:01.001 --> 19:03.681
former colleagues from
a fresh perspective.

19:04.113 --> 19:05.904
And what is it you think you see?

19:06.395 --> 19:09.744
What I see is you and Vera
Bennett pathetically trying to get

19:09.769 --> 19:12.570
me to admit to some imagined
persecution. Anything so you can

19:12.595 --> 19:15.003
- move me back into protection.

19:15.028 --> 19:16.470
An attack maybe?

19:16.495 --> 19:17.863
<i>From what she's told us, she'll</i>

19:17.888 --> 19:20.295
- A ganging?
- <i>need a tetanus shot too.</i>

19:20.320 --> 19:21.864
Have you been attacked?

19:21.889 --> 19:23.555
- <i>Thanks.</i>
- Ganged?

19:23.580 --> 19:25.905
- <i>Yep, righty-o, cheers.</i>
- Um...

19:27.284 --> 19:28.493
no.

19:29.314 --> 19:30.725
Do you know what I see?

19:32.184 --> 19:35.637
I see you submitting yourself
to this brutal ordeal...

19:36.435 --> 19:38.582
to serve some twisted agenda.

19:39.271 --> 19:44.857
And I don't know... what you think
you can achieve, other than death.

19:50.829 --> 19:52.238
What happened to Frankie?

19:56.703 --> 19:58.758
- Bet you're missing her.

20:10.601 --> 20:11.919
Back off, we've got her.

20:12.462 --> 20:13.668
You all right?

20:13.692 --> 20:15.600
Just wanna get back to the unit.

20:17.328 --> 20:18.774
What did they do to you?

20:19.567 --> 20:20.770
Not here.

20:21.526 --> 20:24.869
You devious, twisted, motherfucker.

20:31.907 --> 20:33.302
- It's okay.

20:33.327 --> 20:34.677
It's all right, I've got you. It's okay.

20:34.701 --> 20:39.352
She has severe bruising...
consistent with a brutal sexual assault.

20:39.790 --> 20:43.778
And I am struggling to
understand how that happened,

20:43.803 --> 20:47.511
seeing as she has been under
constant guard for over 48 hours.

20:47.796 --> 20:50.743
She put herself in general,
that's how it happened.

20:51.884 --> 20:55.590
It is my expectation that
if I put someone, anyone,

20:55.615 --> 20:58.670
under guard, they will
not be savagely attacked.

21:02.368 --> 21:03.843
One of you must know something.

21:09.419 --> 21:12.084
All right, then I am presuming...

21:12.396 --> 21:15.504
that all of you can confirm
that at every shift handover,

21:15.529 --> 21:17.343
prison Ferguson was completely unharmed.

21:17.368 --> 21:18.915
She was fine when I got her from Ed.

21:18.940 --> 21:20.717
Yep, same when I handed her over.

21:23.813 --> 21:25.712
Rest assured, this
isn't the end of this.

21:26.196 --> 21:27.984
If anyone has any relevant information,

21:28.009 --> 21:30.867
I'd encourage you to come and
talk to me privately. Thank you.

21:37.863 --> 21:40.803
Have you considered that she
might have done it to herself?

21:46.944 --> 21:48.238
Proctor for you, Governor.

21:51.181 --> 21:52.653
What happened to your face?

21:54.597 --> 21:56.169
Um... I ran into a door.

21:56.458 --> 21:58.313
The same door that
attacked Joan Ferguson?

21:58.338 --> 22:00.084
- Apparently not.
- All right.

22:00.667 --> 22:02.050
Then who did attack her?

22:03.219 --> 22:04.429
How would I know?

22:04.454 --> 22:06.249
You seem to have taken
Ferguson under your wing,

22:06.274 --> 22:07.712
as ill-advised as that may be.

22:07.738 --> 22:11.530
She needed protection and you obviously
couldn't or wouldn't provide it.

22:12.581 --> 22:15.801
Has it occurred to you that
she might be manipulating you?

22:17.697 --> 22:19.736
Are you saying she fucked herself up

22:19.760 --> 22:22.118
to get me onside. Have
you seen her injuries?

22:22.143 --> 22:23.405
Then prove me wrong.

22:23.715 --> 22:25.203
Tell me which prisoner did this.

22:25.634 --> 22:27.538
What makes you think it was a prisoner?

22:31.618 --> 22:33.333
- Where's Mr. Jackson?
- Over there.

22:33.801 --> 22:35.743
Hey, Bea, just about my conjugals...

22:35.768 --> 22:37.979
- Um, I'm about to put in my appeal,
- Yeah, not now Dor...

22:38.004 --> 22:39.210
yeah, but do you reckon
you can have a word

22:39.235 --> 22:40.476
- to the Governor for me?
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

22:40.501 --> 22:42.090
- When though?
- Not now!

22:47.806 --> 22:50.520
Okay, well, thanks for the support, Bea.

22:51.419 --> 22:53.513
<i>Attention compound,
attention compound.</i>

22:53.539 --> 22:55.678
- <i>showers are now available for use.</i>
- Hey.

22:58.244 --> 23:00.685
- What is it, Smith?
- A heads up...

23:00.963 --> 23:02.959
Ferguson's telling people you raped her.

23:02.985 --> 23:04.190
What?

23:06.447 --> 23:08.708
- No one's gonna believe that.
- Proctor does.

23:09.046 --> 23:11.802
- Oh, for fuck's sake! Okay, so
- Ferguson's playing her.

23:11.827 --> 23:13.554
- who did attack her, do you know?
- I don't know but it happened

23:13.579 --> 23:15.843
- at breakfast.
- Okay, wait... wait, breakfast when?

23:16.409 --> 23:17.615
W-when, yesterday?

23:18.613 --> 23:19.820
Allie!

23:20.052 --> 23:22.777
- Allie, you're comin' with me!
- Yeah? Jesus!

23:24.821 --> 23:26.030
Out!

23:26.602 --> 23:28.416
- <i>Nice!</i>
- I said, get out!

23:28.441 --> 23:29.954
<i>God, calm down.</i>

23:32.644 --> 23:34.906
You do love roughing me up
in the showers, don't ya?

23:34.931 --> 23:37.572
You take that back to Kaz and
there'll be consequences, you hear?

23:37.846 --> 23:42.720
You know... you could just say to
me, "Hey, Allie, ah, woman to woman,

23:42.745 --> 23:44.789
- "friend to friend, I prefer it if..."
- You're not a friend of mine.

23:44.814 --> 23:47.192
You don't rule by charm, do you, Bea?

23:49.708 --> 23:51.616
I'm not gonna say anything.

23:52.724 --> 23:53.931
Good.

23:57.094 --> 23:59.802
Yeah, cheers Allie. No
worries, I owe you one.

24:00.397 --> 24:01.676
Are you on with him?

24:03.507 --> 24:04.716
Jackson?

24:05.649 --> 24:07.231
There's definitely something there.

24:08.030 --> 24:09.334
It's... it...

24:13.907 --> 24:17.250
When my daughter died... he
did something for me... he...

24:23.318 --> 24:25.672
He did me a favour and
I'll never forget it.

24:27.876 --> 24:29.082
That's it.

24:33.352 --> 24:34.560
Okay.

24:38.170 --> 24:39.441
So, no sex then?

24:40.847 --> 24:42.054
Good.

24:46.003 --> 24:48.522
- When did you hear this?
- Ah, before.

24:48.751 --> 24:51.537
I mean it's just a rumour. I thought
I should report it immediately.

24:51.883 --> 24:55.977
And where... did this
attack supposedly take place?

24:56.002 --> 24:59.679
Well, I-I didn't get specific details,
possibly during breakfast time.

24:59.704 --> 25:01.936
- In her unit?
- I dunno, Governor.

25:02.002 --> 25:04.282
I mean, as I said, it's
not a formal accusation.

25:04.349 --> 25:06.837
I mean, I haven't made contact
with Ferguson whatsoever.

25:07.155 --> 25:08.918
Okay, so what's this then?

25:10.995 --> 25:12.201
Here.

25:14.382 --> 25:17.710
Okay, yes, I did escort her back to
her unit after the incident in the yard.

25:17.735 --> 25:19.374
I mean it was an emergency situation.

25:19.399 --> 25:23.737
And then you remain in her unit,
unaccounted for, for some time.

25:23.762 --> 25:27.352
- It would have been less than a minute.
- I told you specifically,

25:27.378 --> 25:28.985
to have no contact with Ferguson

25:29.010 --> 25:31.648
- under any circumstances.
- Governor, if you think I did

25:31.674 --> 25:33.233
- anything...
- Oh, of course I don't!

25:33.258 --> 25:37.073
But it is a huge concern that she has
made this accusation, even informally,

25:37.098 --> 25:40.006
and thanks to your carelessness,
you've left yourself wide open.

25:40.308 --> 25:42.519
But officially, she's
still saying she fell.

25:42.750 --> 25:43.959
For now.

25:44.525 --> 25:46.907
Oh, for God's sake, Will.

25:47.982 --> 25:52.363
You know her. You know what she's
like, just stay away from her.

25:58.083 --> 25:59.288
Fuck!

26:03.955 --> 26:06.720
- Oh...
- You wanted to see me?

26:06.760 --> 26:08.643
Just heard a disturbing rumour...

26:08.794 --> 26:10.859
you know, about the conjugals...

26:11.533 --> 26:15.640
that your application had been knocked
back, and yet Jenkins was approved?

26:16.191 --> 26:17.954
Tell me that's not true, surely?

26:20.375 --> 26:22.160
- Really?
- Hm.

26:24.113 --> 26:25.323
It's ridiculous.

26:26.621 --> 26:28.805
Governor Bennett's ruling, I presume.

26:35.210 --> 26:36.662
Can I offer you some advice?

26:46.553 --> 26:47.761
Jenkins.

26:56.057 --> 26:58.337
<i>Yeah, I'd take anything
to get a root, mate.</i>

26:58.740 --> 27:00.578
- <i>I know you would.</i>
- Jenkins...

27:01.510 --> 27:02.717
open up.

27:03.017 --> 27:04.891
- I took it.
- You want that conjugal tomorrow,

27:04.917 --> 27:06.552
I need to know you swallowed that pill.

27:07.896 --> 27:10.045
Arrrrgggghhh!

27:10.070 --> 27:11.660
Bit of toothpaste wouldn't hurt.

27:17.993 --> 27:19.896
- Mr. J.
- Jenkins.

27:22.412 --> 27:24.439
- Rapist.
- What was that?

27:24.969 --> 27:26.358
Proctor, stop!

27:28.276 --> 27:29.484
What was that?

27:29.710 --> 27:32.018
This rumour you're spreading
is bullshit, and you know it.

27:32.043 --> 27:34.102
- You gonna hit me now?
- Don't be ridiculous, okay.

27:34.128 --> 27:36.051
See, I've never touched a prisoner.

27:36.132 --> 27:39.912
There are women in this prison who
are real victims of assault, okay.

27:39.938 --> 27:41.557
You're d... you're
demeaning all of them.

27:41.582 --> 27:43.870
You're demeaning everything
they've been through.

27:43.978 --> 27:47.372
You call yourself a defender
of women, you're pathetic.

27:48.418 --> 27:49.888
Nice speech!

27:53.953 --> 27:55.417
Get Sal and call the others.

27:55.645 --> 27:57.532
- You all right, what happened?
- He's fucking crossed the line.

27:57.558 --> 27:58.898
- Who has?
- Will Jackson, we're getting the reds

27:58.925 --> 28:00.690
- together.
- Okay, just hang on a second.

28:00.715 --> 28:02.904
- No, no, no, it's time for payback.
- Hey, Kaz!

28:03.680 --> 28:06.077
We can't do anything in
here, we're on remand.

28:06.102 --> 28:08.530
Allie, we'll just be really,
really smart about it.

28:08.554 --> 28:10.016
There's cameras everywhere.

28:10.224 --> 28:11.430
Not everywhere.

28:13.560 --> 28:16.693
The surveillance system is far from
infallible, there are deficiencies...

28:17.270 --> 28:18.790
and as it happens...

28:19.363 --> 28:21.047
I know every one.

28:34.145 --> 28:37.741
Come on, Jenkins. Get
moving, your hair's fine.

28:37.766 --> 28:40.160
- <i>This is gonna be great!</i>
- Don't touch it.

28:40.184 --> 28:42.375
- I can't do that.
- Don't touch it!

28:42.400 --> 28:44.116
- I have to.
- No.

28:44.368 --> 28:45.712
You look beautiful.

28:45.738 --> 28:48.158
- Whoo!

28:50.609 --> 28:53.123
Come on, bitches!

28:55.243 --> 28:57.545

29:26.256 --> 29:29.722
two hours, condoms are provided.
They're on the side table.

29:45.603 --> 29:47.009
You been workin' out, Daz?

29:49.610 --> 29:51.443
Yeah, yeah a little bit.

29:53.016 --> 29:54.217
Yeah...

29:55.132 --> 29:57.516
- Cool... all right...
- Hey, just wait,

29:57.541 --> 29:58.929
- just hold on a second...
- What?

29:58.954 --> 30:01.981
I... I reckon... your
sister might be onto us.

30:02.006 --> 30:04.238
Wh-why... what did ya say?

30:04.264 --> 30:06.456
I said I was lookin'
at a second hand Nissan.

30:06.481 --> 30:08.565
- Oh, yeah, that's good...
- But then a fuckin' screw rang up

30:08.588 --> 30:11.608
yesterday, doin' a cross check
and she was in the next room.

30:11.633 --> 30:15.026
Right, well, you're
here now, yeah, so...

30:15.280 --> 30:17.732
- might as well just do it, hey?
- Nuh, what if she finds out?

30:17.757 --> 30:19.996
- How's she gonna know?
- Well, I don't know, she might...

30:20.022 --> 30:21.479
smell me or somethin'.

30:21.504 --> 30:24.218
- Well, fuck, just have a shower!
- What, here...

30:24.244 --> 30:27.166
- in a lady prison?
- What? No, no, go to your mum's

30:27.192 --> 30:29.301
- place on the way back, yeah?
- I don't talk about Mum anymore.

30:29.327 --> 30:30.914
Well, d-d... Daz...

30:31.668 --> 30:33.829
this is the first
time I've had sex in...

30:34.044 --> 30:37.362
er, oh, fuckin' ages...

30:37.387 --> 30:40.319
- so Daz, no well, think about it...
- Hey?

30:40.750 --> 30:42.094
hey...

30:42.751 --> 30:44.226
I'll do everything.

30:47.307 --> 30:48.793
Everything, everything?

30:49.816 --> 30:51.019
Yep.

30:51.886 --> 30:53.691
- Even the...
- Yep.

30:55.745 --> 30:57.084
- Everything.

30:59.484 --> 31:01.988
- Huh?
- Whoa.

31:02.013 --> 31:03.383
I guess, maybe I could...

31:03.408 --> 31:05.354
- stop at Damo's on the way home
- Yeah.

31:05.379 --> 31:07.481
- and have a shower there.
- Yeah.

31:07.506 --> 31:09.613
- Damo's...

31:09.638 --> 31:12.489
- Yeah!

31:16.420 --> 31:18.429
You can understand our position,

31:18.455 --> 31:19.792
- Doreen.
- I have always been

31:19.817 --> 31:21.636
- a model prisoner.
- Your pregnancy

31:21.662 --> 31:24.918
- reflected very badly on this prison.
- If I could finish...

31:29.265 --> 31:33.128
I have always been a model
prisoner, and now peer worker...

31:33.153 --> 31:36.257
the day I fell pregnant,
I was left unsupervised

31:36.282 --> 31:39.852
and unprotected amongst five
visiting male prisoners...

31:40.368 --> 31:44.297
my legal advice suggests that's a
massive breach of your duty of care,

31:44.564 --> 31:46.730
and I'd be well within my rights to sue.

31:47.512 --> 31:50.398
There would also be
significant media interest

31:50.423 --> 31:55.384
in a young Wentworth prisoner who ended
up pregnant, via staff incompetence.

31:57.706 --> 32:00.437
But... I might not take those steps...

32:00.904 --> 32:03.999
if my conjugal application
were to be approved.

32:04.674 --> 32:06.305
Who have you been talking to?

32:08.786 --> 32:10.242
Oh, Doreen...

32:13.170 --> 32:14.378
Sorry.

32:14.871 --> 32:16.198
It's the pressure.

32:18.307 --> 32:20.554
- Me arm's gettin' sore.
- Oh, sorry.

32:22.772 --> 32:24.786
- Fuck, is this 'cause of Trina?
- No.

32:24.810 --> 32:27.149
- You only like it with her now?
- No, it's not like that.

32:27.174 --> 32:29.020
- No? Mm.
- No, you're still the best.

32:29.045 --> 32:32.304
Trina? Trina never wants to do
any of the stuff you used to do.

32:32.654 --> 32:33.946
Yeah, like what?

32:34.161 --> 32:38.208
Doggie style, nup. Motorboat,
nup. Suck me off, nup.

32:38.233 --> 32:41.488
Not unless you're just straight out of
the shower. She never wants to do that.

32:41.513 --> 32:43.613
She won't even discuss
the other thing...

32:43.852 --> 32:45.939
Oh... fuck!

32:47.608 --> 32:48.812
Oh, yeah!

32:49.356 --> 32:51.133
Oh, wait, wait, hold on...

32:52.557 --> 32:54.137
No, no, no. No condom, you

32:54.163 --> 32:56.007
- don't need it. No, you don't need it.
- Wait, no, I gotta, they said I gotta.

32:56.032 --> 32:57.835
- You don't need it!
- If you get... if you get preggers,

32:57.860 --> 33:00.104
- I'll go to jail.
- No... no, they won't blame you

33:00.128 --> 33:01.672
they'll blame me 'cause
I'm meant to be on the pill.

33:01.697 --> 33:03.551
- What, wait, what?
- What?

33:04.252 --> 33:06.459
Are you... are you
tryin' to get pregnant?

33:07.948 --> 33:09.153
Just a bit.

33:12.049 --> 33:14.684
Hey, Dazza, come on. Daz... Daz?

33:14.963 --> 33:16.706
What are you doin'...? Come on.

33:16.897 --> 33:19.295
- Come on, no don't do that.
- I'm with Trina now!

33:19.321 --> 33:21.996
Stop thinkin' about her,
stop thinkin' about her.

33:22.022 --> 33:24.136
- You can't have...
- Daz, please! I want this,

33:24.161 --> 33:26.654
- I want this so fuckin' bad!
- Yeah, we all want things.

33:26.680 --> 33:28.337
No. Worse than anything.

33:28.362 --> 33:29.733
I'll be a really good mum.

33:29.758 --> 33:31.125
- Suz...
- I will be...

33:31.851 --> 33:33.833
I promise you, I'll
be a really good mum.

33:34.503 --> 33:35.707
Yeah.

33:35.732 --> 33:40.287
I really will, I promise you.
So, please, just please.

33:40.313 --> 33:43.873
I cross my heart,
promise. Please?

33:44.281 --> 33:45.724
I'm sorry, Suz.

33:45.749 --> 33:48.146
- Please, don't... come back. Dazzy?!
- Oi!

33:48.345 --> 33:50.107
Dazzy, come back!

33:50.279 --> 33:51.804
Don't go.

34:04.052 --> 34:05.261
Split here.

34:05.426 --> 34:07.797
When you get to the walkway,
hug close and stay low.

34:08.800 --> 34:11.483
- Filming it?
- And uploading, standard.

34:13.824 --> 34:15.623
- You right?
- Yeah.

34:16.882 --> 34:19.358
- Don't mask-up 'til the walkway, okay?
- Yeah.

34:19.384 --> 34:20.590
Go!

34:28.485 --> 34:29.975
Yeah, this one's buggered.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.462
Ha! Why am I not surprised?

34:33.813 --> 34:35.018
Oh, Boomer!

34:35.514 --> 34:37.203
- Hey, lovely,
- What is it?

34:37.228 --> 34:39.071
- what happened?
- Hey, what happened?

34:39.809 --> 34:41.873
- Honey, what's up? Honey...
- Boomer... did you see Daz?

34:41.899 --> 34:44.831
- Oh! Boomer, love.

34:44.856 --> 34:48.348
- What happened? Oh, darling...
- Did you see Daz?

34:50.954 --> 34:52.161
Everything okay?

34:52.187 --> 34:54.297
There's going to be an
attack on Mr. Jackson.

34:54.495 --> 34:56.612
- What?
- Payback, for the Ferguson thing. Now!

34:56.639 --> 34:59.435
- Wait... wait, where?
- In the kitchen, he's on duty.

34:59.461 --> 35:00.824
- I've gotta go, sorry.
- <i>Novak?</i>

35:00.849 --> 35:02.375
<i>- Sorry.
- What are you doin' here?</i>

35:02.401 --> 35:05.101
<i>Ah, sorry. Yeah, I thought I'd
left something there, but I...</i>

35:05.126 --> 35:07.472
- <i>I have to iron. I mean...</i>

35:26.972 --> 35:29.278
Okay, that's the last of it.

35:29.557 --> 35:33.479
- Are we good to go, Mr. Jackson?
- Yep, you're good. Thank you.

35:37.877 --> 35:39.431
- Clear?
- Yeah.

35:42.360 --> 35:43.567
Ricardo?

35:48.781 --> 35:50.986
<i>Slow down, Smith,
or I'll have you on report.</i>

35:57.437 --> 35:59.315
- Where's Allie?
- Dunno.

36:01.948 --> 36:03.904
Smith! Why aren't you
at your workstation?

36:04.088 --> 36:05.294
Smith?!

36:07.909 --> 36:09.533
You need... you need
to call Mr. Jackson.

36:09.557 --> 36:11.949
You should radio Mr. Jackson and tell
him to get out of the kitchen now.

36:11.974 --> 36:13.183
What are you talking about?

36:13.607 --> 36:15.247
- Hey!
- Mr. Jackson, if you're in the

36:15.271 --> 36:17.363
<i>kitchen you need to get out of
their immediately. Can you hear me?</i>

36:17.389 --> 36:19.522
<i>Mr. Jackson, get out of the kitchen now!</i>

36:19.547 --> 36:20.758
Yep. Copy that.

36:24.238 --> 36:26.710
<i>Fuck! Don't! Don't... no!</i>

36:26.959 --> 36:28.332
<i>No, no!</i>

36:30.311 --> 36:31.520
<i>Argh!</i>

36:33.422 --> 36:35.508
<i>Ah! Ah!</i>

36:35.533 --> 36:36.820
<i>I'm down!</i>

36:36.845 --> 36:38.759
<i>Ugh! Argh!</i>

36:43.854 --> 36:45.055
Go on!

36:48.902 --> 36:50.107
<i>Argh!</i>

36:51.609 --> 36:53.688
<i>Mr. Jackson, are you
reading me, are you okay?</i>

36:53.713 --> 36:55.882
<i>Mr. Jackson, have
you left the kitchen?</i>

36:58.399 --> 36:59.747
Get out, now!

37:01.065 --> 37:04.591
This is a Code Blue. Officer needs
assistance in the dining room.

37:06.124 --> 37:07.965
- <i>Attention compound,</i>
- Fuck!

37:07.990 --> 37:10.954
- <i>this is a Code Blue. Code Blue.</i>
- Get back to your units, now, go!

37:11.145 --> 37:13.819
- <i>All prisoners, return to their units.</i>
- Go, go, go, go!

37:13.844 --> 37:16.615
<i>- I repeat. This is a Code Blue.</i>
- <i>Officer requires</i>

37:16.639 --> 37:18.709
<i>assistance in the
dining area immediately.</i>

37:18.735 --> 37:21.182
<i>All prisoners, return to their units.</i>

37:35.816 --> 37:37.282
Fucking Red Right Hand,
I'm going to get 'em.

37:37.307 --> 37:39.100
Yeah, well, slow down. If
they were all wearing masks,

37:39.126 --> 37:40.648
you won't be able to
formally identify them.

37:40.674 --> 37:41.773
Give me five minutes with Proctor

37:41.797 --> 37:43.205
- and I'll make sure.
- You know I can't sanction that.

37:43.229 --> 37:47.052
You... you know sometimes, Will, I
seriously worry about your judgement.

37:47.077 --> 37:49.129
- What, because I care about my job?
- That's exactly what

37:49.155 --> 37:50.792
- Proctor wants you to do. No, to
- No, that's bullshit!

37:50.817 --> 37:54.082
provoke you into an act of violence.
You just need to calm down and think.

37:54.106 --> 37:57.180
Okay, so we just... we just let them
get away with attacking an officer?

37:57.205 --> 37:58.948
At least you didn't wind up with Hep-C.

38:00.155 --> 38:04.436
Just tell Linda to
send Smith to my office.

38:04.461 --> 38:05.658
Fine.

38:09.696 --> 38:11.310
I'm so sorry.

38:11.921 --> 38:13.241
I got stopped.

38:14.342 --> 38:15.536
Did you tell 'em?

38:16.870 --> 38:18.071
Tell who?

38:18.097 --> 38:19.611
Did you tell Bea Smith?

38:20.084 --> 38:22.449
What? No.

38:22.521 --> 38:25.637
Allie, you were the only one that knew
about that attack that wasn't there.

38:25.661 --> 38:28.337
I got pulled in for a random drug test.

38:28.870 --> 38:30.710
I didn't say anything, I promise.

38:30.877 --> 38:32.845
Might I make an observation?

38:36.709 --> 38:41.183
The attack failed, yes? But
Bea Smith was exposed, publicly.

38:41.583 --> 38:44.931
Screaming for her lover, a screw.

38:45.976 --> 38:49.153
For a self-proclaimed Top
Dog, there is no greater sin.

38:50.040 --> 38:53.145
You capitalise on that, it will
be the final nail in her coffin.

39:08.617 --> 39:10.920
Come on, Smith, you obviously
knew what was going on.

39:11.410 --> 39:13.526
I just wanted a chat with Mr. Jackson.

39:13.829 --> 39:15.693
You grabbed Miss Miles' radio,

39:15.718 --> 39:18.446
you're aware that's a slottable
offence. Just tell me what you know.

39:19.074 --> 39:20.272
Nothing...

39:20.705 --> 39:21.903
sorry.

39:24.178 --> 39:25.592
Could you give us a moment?

39:32.715 --> 39:34.894
I can slot Kaz Proctor...

39:35.641 --> 39:39.520
we can break this alliance with
Ferguson, if you talk to me.

39:40.682 --> 39:41.880
Please...

39:46.304 --> 39:48.458
Dunno, sorry.

39:50.727 --> 39:51.922
Miss Miles?

39:53.846 --> 39:55.550
I will deal with you later.

40:05.608 --> 40:06.907
<i>Screw lover!</i>

40:09.899 --> 40:11.176
<i>Screw fucker!</i>

40:15.771 --> 40:16.973
<i>Here she comes.</i>

40:16.998 --> 40:18.397
<i>Wasn't that the truth.</i>

40:19.296 --> 40:21.262
Not so popular
now, are ya, Smith?

40:21.966 --> 40:24.315
I guess it will give you something to
think about when you're in the slot.

40:24.339 --> 40:26.635
- Right-o.
- Bloody hell, Bea,

40:26.660 --> 40:29.571
I warned you about defending a
screw and what do you do?

40:29.621 --> 40:31.229
You take out a fucking ad!

40:31.253 --> 40:34.683
Oh, you know how this goes, Liz. I'll be
slotted and then it will all blow over.

40:34.707 --> 40:38.049
Well, you better bloody hope so,
'cause Kaz is revvin' up the women,

40:38.074 --> 40:40.444
- and they all think you betrayed them.
- Okay.

40:40.719 --> 40:41.915
It's not okay.

40:43.190 --> 40:45.466
- She's not herself, is she?
- Nup.

40:45.630 --> 40:48.242
Been tryin' to talk to her
and she just bloody ignores me.

40:48.367 --> 40:50.607
- We're supposed to be her family.
- Mmm.

40:50.818 --> 40:52.754
And I feel like the cranky grandmother.

40:54.091 --> 40:55.841
Wait, can you play the whole thing?

40:59.181 --> 41:00.531
We have to slot her.

41:00.804 --> 41:02.207
What, for warning me?

41:03.003 --> 41:06.700
She disobeyed an officer and seized
her radio. What other option do we have?

41:06.725 --> 41:08.959
Look, just let me handle it.

41:14.094 --> 41:16.603
I played right into her hands.

41:16.629 --> 41:19.291
- Bea, it doesn't matter about Kaz.
- Now I've lost the women...

Right, let's go.

42:57.471 --> 42:59.192
