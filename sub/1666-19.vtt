"The Originals"...

00:01.588 --> 00:02.613
Hayley: Kill him.

00:02.614 --> 00:06.650
If we can't all create some sort of
community, then what's the point?

00:06.651 --> 00:08.731
Kill each other
and get it all over with.

00:08.732 --> 00:10.099
Elijah: If there
is no peace between us,

00:10.100 --> 00:12.554
then how can you expect
others to follow suit?

00:12.720 --> 00:15.938
Klaus: The city's inhabitants will
not adhere to this agreement.

00:15.939 --> 00:19.353
We have a message for Marcel Girard.

00:19.519 --> 00:20.943
You and I were betrothed.

00:20.944 --> 00:22.777
I guess that makes us
kind of like royalty.

00:22.779 --> 00:25.646
We made an alliance that's gonna
change everything for the wolves.

00:25.648 --> 00:27.486
An alliance with who?
Klaus.

00:27.652 --> 00:30.619
Klaus: A moonlight ring to protect
werewolves from the curse.

00:30.620 --> 00:32.115
What do I have to do?

00:32.281 --> 00:34.155
Kieran: I've been hexed, and
I don't know how long I have.

00:34.157 --> 00:35.357
Cami: The pills, they're not working.

00:35.358 --> 00:37.159
Klaus: These hexes,
they start with magic.

00:37.160 --> 00:39.331
They alter the very
chemistry of the brain.

00:39.497 --> 00:40.629
I can't be fixed?

00:40.630 --> 00:43.931
There's only death...
Mine and yours.

This is the blood.

01:02.685 --> 01:08.684
May they cleanse me of sin and
preserve my soul in life everlasting.

01:11.320 --> 01:15.200
Bastianna: I'd say it's
a little late for that, father.

01:16.531 --> 01:19.329
I see you still have your faith.

01:19.869 --> 01:21.498
You stay away.

01:21.664 --> 01:24.042
If only it could save you...

01:28.343 --> 01:30.215

Be gone, demon.

01:37.019 --> 01:38.890

No.

01:44.527 --> 01:48.796

01:48.797 --> 01:53.530
Oh, Sean, I tried to help you.

01:53.696 --> 01:59.911
I tried to save you, but this city...
This city is full of monsters.

02:00.943 --> 02:04.666
Uh, yeah.
Trust me, I know.

02:04.832 --> 02:07.615
Remind me to never piss off a witch.

02:07.616 --> 02:09.378
Aagh!

02:11.119 --> 02:13.653

Uncle Kieran?

02:29.982 --> 02:32.772
What do you want from me?

02:34.642 --> 02:36.948
You saw that, right?

02:37.114 --> 02:40.035
It was just for a
second, but it was him.

02:42.783 --> 02:44.285
I don't know, Cami.

02:44.286 --> 02:46.958
I mean, maybe he's still in
there underneath all the crazy,

02:47.124 --> 02:50.170
but the crazy is pretty thick.

02:50.336 --> 02:53.727
Maybe he just needs
a shock to his system,

02:53.728 --> 02:56.831
something to wipe the slate clean.

02:56.832 --> 03:00.430
Josh, I think I have an idea
on how to fix him.

03:15.749 --> 03:17.518
Can I help you find something?

03:17.519 --> 03:19.616
Yes. In fact, I believe you can.

03:19.782 --> 03:24.658
I'm looking for a book about yay big

03:24.659 --> 03:27.627
filled with our mother's
most powerful spells.

03:27.629 --> 03:30.329
It appears to have been misplaced.

03:30.876 --> 03:33.467
How very mysterious.
Indeed.

03:33.468 --> 03:35.590
At first, I feared
the witches had succeeded

03:36.137 --> 03:38.472
in their efforts to obtain it,

03:38.473 --> 03:40.774
but considering
their last attempt ended

03:40.775 --> 03:43.110
with me relieving a rather
large, tattooed gentleman

03:43.111 --> 03:46.079
of his hands, I began to wonder

03:46.080 --> 03:48.770
if the thief wasn't
a bit closer to home.

03:52.185 --> 03:55.026
Don't make this harder
than it needs to be, brother.

03:58.225 --> 04:02.829
Well, admittedly, I did have a
theory that your sudden interest

04:02.830 --> 04:05.732
in mother's grimoire was in some way
related to whatever foolishness

04:05.733 --> 04:08.415
you've been conducting
with the crescent wolves.

04:08.581 --> 04:11.872
Therefore, I took it upon myself to
carefully place it where naughty,

04:11.873 --> 04:13.872
little fingers could not pry.

04:13.874 --> 04:15.575
And here I thought you, of all people,

04:15.576 --> 04:20.512
would understand, I am simply
trying to help those wolves,

04:21.802 --> 04:27.434
play samaritan to the abused, champion
to the underdog, so to speak.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.055
How splendidly noble of you.

04:29.056 --> 04:30.657
Have you ever considered
that, like you,

04:30.658 --> 04:32.758
I am trying to keep Hayley safe,

04:32.760 --> 04:35.161
using our mother's magic
to empower her people

04:35.162 --> 04:37.319
so they are capable of protecting her?

04:37.485 --> 04:40.934
Yes, unless, of course, they decide
to seek retribution for decades

04:40.935 --> 04:45.972
held in exile, and Hayley will
find herself in the middle

04:45.973 --> 04:49.842
of an uprising, one that will
only provoke further violence.

04:49.843 --> 04:54.647
You see, you risk turning New
Orleans into a war zone, brother.

04:54.648 --> 04:56.949
I won't let that happen.

04:56.950 --> 04:59.883
The drums of war were beating
long before we returned.

05:00.049 --> 05:05.458
I suggest you use a little less of
this and a little more of these.

05:05.459 --> 05:07.427
Mm...

05:07.428 --> 05:09.228
Uh-uh. No way.

me how bad things have gotten.

05:11.799 --> 05:13.647
I should be there for you.
Just let me help.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.401
How, by getting yourself killed?

05:15.402 --> 05:17.317
You have a target
on your back, Marcel.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.971
The last thing I need is for
you to get hurt because of me.

05:19.973 --> 05:22.575
I'm more worried about you.
Kieran is dangerous.

05:22.576 --> 05:23.740

You come here, I'll throw
you out myself, all right?

05:27.034 --> 05:27.911

is likely to make me

06:03.883 --> 06:06.018
regret what mercy I've shown thus far.

Yeah, yeah. I know.

me, don't make her suffer for it.

Josh?
Oh, right.

06:22.923 --> 06:24.369
Dude, be cool.

06:24.370 --> 06:27.372
It's just a priest hexed by a
witch because of some vampires.

06:27.373 --> 06:30.041
Accept that these things
are real, then forget them.

06:30.514 --> 06:33.312

You forget them later.

06:33.313 --> 06:35.681

Let me start over.

06:35.682 --> 06:39.484
Dr. Sheski, my uncle needs to
be sedated, something strong.

06:39.485 --> 06:40.886
Sedation?

06:40.887 --> 06:42.654
He looks like he should be in an ICU.

06:42.655 --> 06:44.589
Yeah. See, this other witch
put this boundary spell on him.

06:44.590 --> 06:46.281
So he's kind of stuck in here.

06:46.447 --> 06:48.659
This man is malnourished,
severely dehydrated.

06:48.661 --> 06:51.562
Which is why you're here,
but first, doctor,

06:51.564 --> 06:53.538
what do you know about shock therapy?

06:53.704 --> 06:56.234
ECT?

06:56.235 --> 06:58.335
First, it's incredibly dangerous.

06:58.501 --> 07:02.573
But it has been known to help
treat cases of extreme psychosis.

07:03.575 --> 07:05.910
Answer the nice lady.

07:07.045 --> 07:11.750
We don't fully understand it
yet, but, yes, in some patients,

07:11.751 --> 07:14.552
using electrical current
to induce seizures

07:14.553 --> 07:18.897
can subvert a psychotic episode,
in effect, rebooting the brain,

07:19.063 --> 07:21.459
but only in the most extreme
cases, do we even consider...

07:21.460 --> 07:24.462
Like my friend said, we're talking
about a priest hexed by a witch.

07:24.463 --> 07:27.365
I don't think it gets
any more extreme than that.

thing in, say, a hospital,

and the drugs?

07:44.183 --> 07:45.750

have been having babies

07:45.751 --> 07:47.685
out here since before you were born.

Then what, Eve?

have a mother, let alone be one.

a great provocation.

us breathing the same way.

he can remove your curse.

that comes with turning,

I just couldn't lose
you, not like that.

I made Klaus give you his blood.

27:42.318 --> 27:45.119

So the devil has a deal
for me, after all.

27:49.721 --> 27:51.795
Uncle Kieran...

27:51.961 --> 27:56.730
That hunger you feel,
it'll only grow stronger.

27:56.732 --> 27:59.886
I know how it works.

28:00.052 --> 28:04.572
Then you will soon know if you
do not feed, you will die.

28:04.573 --> 28:10.572
I know if that's the choice that I
have to make, I'm dead already.

28:16.317 --> 28:20.620
Please leave me with my niece.

28:20.622 --> 28:22.989
I'd like a private moment
to talk with her.

28:27.995 --> 28:30.765
It's ok.

28:30.766 --> 28:36.765
Klaus, thank you for
today, for being kind.

28:48.382 --> 28:50.483
[Eve moaning]

28:53.887 --> 28:58.458
Hey, Ollie, how do I look?

28:59.960 --> 29:02.695
You look fine, Evie.
You look just fine.

29:02.697 --> 29:05.565
You always were a terrible liar.

29:07.034 --> 29:09.581
Damn it. Look.

29:09.747 --> 29:11.538
All you got to do is
just trigger the curse.

29:11.539 --> 29:13.307
You'll heal.

29:13.308 --> 29:17.214
It's who we are.
It's who you are.

29:17.380 --> 29:19.378
Why can't you just accept that?

29:19.380 --> 29:22.882
Why can't anyone see
what needs to be done?

29:25.179 --> 29:27.391
Living here like animals,
fighting between tribes,

29:27.557 --> 29:29.935
scared to stand up for ourselves.

29:30.101 --> 29:33.727
Who's gonna lead us, Jackson?

29:33.728 --> 29:36.108
He wants to bow down to that hybrid.

29:36.274 --> 29:40.266
Hayley?
She's not one of us.

29:42.697 --> 29:46.072
At least now, we have
an enemy to hate.

29:46.678 --> 29:52.249
Oliver, no. Tell me you didn't...
You don't understand.

29:52.415 --> 29:54.414
Then explain it to me, Ollie.

29:54.415 --> 29:56.461
I know you.

29:56.627 --> 29:58.884
I know you wouldn't
hurt your own people.

29:58.886 --> 30:01.187
Look.

30:01.188 --> 30:04.010
It wasn't supposed to
happen like this, Evie.

30:05.026 --> 30:09.683
I just wanted to make a little
noise, just get our people mad,

30:10.598 --> 30:13.099
but I didn't agree to all this.

30:13.100 --> 30:18.237
They stabbed me in the back, and now...
Who? Who put you up to this?

30:21.474 --> 30:25.845
You stupid kid.

30:25.846 --> 30:27.614
Do you have any idea
what the pack is gonna

30:27.615 --> 30:29.870
do to you when they find out?

30:37.590 --> 30:41.828
They're not gonna find out, Evie.

30:41.829 --> 30:47.220
If they did, all those people
would have died in vain.

30:47.701 --> 30:53.700
I had to do whatever it
took to make us strong.

30:55.019 --> 30:56.309
Ollie, no.

30:56.310 --> 30:57.677
I've got to do that even now.

30:57.678 --> 31:01.151
Ollie, it's all over now.

31:01.317 --> 31:03.716
No! No! Oh! Ollie!

31:03.717 --> 31:05.117
I'm sorry, Eve.

31:05.118 --> 31:06.985
Mmph mmph!

31:14.316 --> 31:16.685
Everything is where
you said it would be

31:16.686 --> 31:18.254
except that key you mentioned.

31:18.255 --> 31:19.822
That's the one thing I couldn't find.

31:19.823 --> 31:21.856
It's the one you usually
wear around your neck?

31:22.421 --> 31:25.461
That key is a very important
part of our family legacy.

31:25.462 --> 31:27.329
You have to find it.

31:27.330 --> 31:30.531
I will, I promise.

31:35.070 --> 31:37.306
[Exhales]

31:37.307 --> 31:41.343
I am so sorry.

31:41.344 --> 31:45.111
I never wanted to involve
you in this, in any of it.

31:46.982 --> 31:49.851
This can't be how it ends.

31:49.852 --> 31:52.702
It was the only way
it was ever going to end.

31:52.868 --> 31:56.081
I made peace with that
a long time ago.

32:02.230 --> 32:04.566
Listen.

32:04.567 --> 32:08.036
I don't know how bad
this is gonna get,

32:08.037 --> 32:13.374
and I don't want you to see it.

32:13.375 --> 32:19.374
So in a moment, I'm gonna let go,
and you are gonna turn around,

32:20.074 --> 32:23.608
and you are gonna walk out of
here without looking back...

32:26.721 --> 32:29.090
Ok, kiddo?

32:29.091 --> 32:34.261
Promise me, without looking back.

32:54.182 --> 32:56.284
Oliver: They are counting
on our doubts.

32:56.285 --> 32:58.051
That's right!
Yeah!

32:58.601 --> 33:00.722
They are counting on our fears!

33:00.723 --> 33:02.647
That's right!
Right!

33:02.813 --> 33:04.125
You stayed.

33:04.126 --> 33:08.278
Oliver: Come morning, they will
know that we are not cowards.

33:08.444 --> 33:10.131
What's going on?
What is he doing?

33:10.132 --> 33:11.865
We are not afraid!

33:12.031 --> 33:15.169
He's making a move for power
in the wake of tragedy.

33:15.170 --> 33:16.786
He's not alone.

33:16.952 --> 33:18.906
There was another attack
after you left.

33:18.907 --> 33:20.707
What?

33:27.963 --> 33:29.983
Elijah: Your friend Jackson
will need your help.

33:32.453 --> 33:35.155
They will want vengeance...

33:38.693 --> 33:41.686
Blood for blood...

33:44.165 --> 33:46.333
And, unfortunately, in troubled times,

33:46.334 --> 33:48.469
people do not look for the best...

33:48.470 --> 33:50.871
[Cheering]

33:50.872 --> 33:52.948
But rather the loudest.

33:53.114 --> 33:54.741
Oliver: Hey! Hey!

34:23.203 --> 34:25.672
I'm surprised to see you here.

34:25.672 --> 34:30.860
The bayou explosion, the
attack on my child.

34:31.379 --> 34:33.813
Tell me what you know.

34:33.815 --> 34:38.827
I know the wolves have no shortage
of enemies, Marcel for one.

34:38.993 --> 34:40.487
Marcel wouldn't stoop so low.

34:40.487 --> 34:42.998
The witches, however...

34:43.164 --> 34:47.002
I have witnessed firsthand
the depths of your cruelty.

34:47.168 --> 34:49.630
You don't think I did this.

34:49.630 --> 34:52.966
What kind of monster
do you take me for?

34:55.717 --> 34:58.972
How ugly I must seem next to the pure,

34:58.973 --> 35:02.409
innocent glow of
your precious Camille.

35:02.410 --> 35:05.778
So sad about her uncle, by the way.

35:07.247 --> 35:10.684
Kieran is in transition.

35:10.685 --> 35:13.820
He has been released from the hex.

35:25.031 --> 35:28.334
Genevieve: A hex of that magnitude?

35:28.500 --> 35:31.904
Kieran's hex will return...

35:33.073 --> 35:35.050
If it hasn't already.

35:47.153 --> 35:48.621
No!

35:48.622 --> 35:51.124
Bastianna: Not yet, priest.

35:51.125 --> 35:53.927
There's more work to be done,

35:53.928 --> 35:57.964
a final offering to
complete your penance,

35:57.965 --> 36:02.619
that which you hold most dear.

36:05.338 --> 36:07.040
[Creak]

36:07.206 --> 36:09.542
Genevieve: That boundary
spell, on the other hand,

36:09.708 --> 36:15.882
now that he's died, I imagine it
won't be quite so confining anymore.

36:48.422 --> 36:51.557
[Sniffles]

36:56.029 --> 36:58.865
Have you changed your mind?

36:58.866 --> 37:03.068
Yes. It appears I have.

37:08.575 --> 37:10.228
Oh!

37:10.394 --> 37:12.077
Aah!

37:18.351 --> 37:20.085
[Whimpering]

37:22.222 --> 37:23.922
Aah!

37:35.268 --> 37:36.401
Don't fight it, Cami.

37:36.403 --> 37:37.380
Aah!

37:41.941 --> 37:44.470
In death, we are whole again.

37:44.636 --> 37:45.722
Ah! Aah!

37:50.809 --> 37:53.652
Bastianna: Bless her, father.

37:53.654 --> 37:55.420
Kill her.

37:55.422 --> 37:56.941
Rejoice in life eternal.

37:57.107 --> 37:58.151
[Hiss]

37:58.317 --> 38:00.111
[Crack]

38:08.702 --> 38:11.706
You deserved far better than this.

38:13.673 --> 38:15.919
Uh!

38:17.577 --> 38:20.131
[Music playing]

38:34.493 --> 38:36.861
[Cell phone ringing]

38:41.267 --> 38:42.601
[Beep]

38:42.602 --> 38:44.003
Klaus, you need to know
I had nothing to do

38:44.004 --> 38:45.905
with that business
out in the bayou today.

38:45.906 --> 38:48.374
Klaus, on phone:
I never thought you did.

38:48.375 --> 38:52.510
I'm calling to let you
know the priest is dead.

38:54.373 --> 38:58.417
Your exile is suspended
for the next 24 hours.

38:58.418 --> 39:01.256
You may return to the
quarter to bury your friend.

39:02.521 --> 39:05.190
Why are you doing this?

39:05.687 --> 39:11.190
She woke in the dark not
knowing where she was...

39:14.101 --> 39:16.479
Or who was watching over her.

39:18.270 --> 39:24.269
It was your name she called, and
if you can grant her comfort,

39:25.245 --> 39:26.656
so be it.

39:45.197 --> 39:48.600
Oliver: Look.
I know where I'm going.

39:48.601 --> 39:52.938
If any of you want to follow,
hey, that's up to you.

39:52.939 --> 39:54.439
That's up to you!

39:54.440 --> 39:57.979
[Cheering]

40:05.517 --> 40:08.072
Kieran is dead.

40:09.688 --> 40:10.908
Did you get it?

40:16.828 --> 40:19.596
It was around his neck,
just like you said.

40:21.666 --> 40:24.005
P.S.... I do not feel
awesome about this.

40:24.171 --> 40:28.506
I know... But people are
gonna be coming after this.

40:28.507 --> 40:30.345
Cami is not ready for that, not yet.

40:30.511 --> 40:33.011
So what now?

40:33.012 --> 40:35.280
Storm clouds are gathering.

40:35.281 --> 40:38.917
Someone bombed those wolves,
and we know it wasn't us.

40:38.918 --> 40:44.621
Witches, humans, vampires, wolves.

40:47.027 --> 40:49.572
City is at a breaking point.

40:55.233 --> 40:57.580
We need to be ready.

40:59.470 --> 41:04.308
First Marcel's massacre,
now bombs in the bayou.

41:04.309 --> 41:09.300
I'll assume you're ready to
give up this doomed treaty.

41:09.466 --> 41:13.584
This alliance with the wolves,
well, if it is to succeed,

41:13.585 --> 41:16.319
I believe you'll want this.

41:18.823 --> 41:23.594
Seems I have Hayley to thank
for your change of heart.

41:23.595 --> 41:27.860
The rifts in this city run far deeper
than I even imagined, Niklaus.

41:30.101 --> 41:33.771
These tribes, these
factions, they're families,

41:33.772 --> 41:35.743
families who choose to fight.

41:38.175 --> 41:43.613
Mayhem has descended upon our home,
and if I'm to choose a side...

41:49.887 --> 41:51.893
To our victory, brother.
