WEBVTT

00:02.708 --> 00:06.794
PETE: Oh, my God.
(moaning)

00:06.912 --> 00:08.829
(shuddering moans)

00:14.253 --> 00:17.722
Oh, my God.
Oh, oh, my...

00:17.839 --> 00:20.141
(muttering)
God, that was incredible.

00:20.259 --> 00:21.626
What happened?
That was a little risky.

00:21.734 --> 00:23.235
Wait, what do you mean,
risky? What...

00:23.402 --> 00:25.320
Is something going on down
there? Is it...

00:25.454 --> 00:27.872
Oh, no, no, that's not...
No, no. I'm a...

00:27.990 --> 00:30.742
This is a clean machine.
Oh, okay.

00:30.910 --> 00:33.044
What-what's up?
Um, I have a mild case of

00:33.162 --> 00:37.048
epilepsy, and I just had a
little seizure, I think.

00:37.166 --> 00:39.751
Oh, my God, Heather.
No, I am so sorry.

00:39.885 --> 00:42.137
I didn't realize I was bringing
that on. I just...

00:42.255 --> 00:44.589
Oh, no.
Don't worry about it, because

00:44.724 --> 00:46.591
you didn't do it.
Well, you know, I was a

00:46.759 --> 00:48.593
participant in it, for sure.
No, it wasn't you at all.

00:48.761 --> 00:51.346
Nothing you did affected me
physically in any way, shape

00:51.480 --> 00:54.683
or form.
Uh, thank you.

00:54.817 --> 00:57.102
(sighs) Just have to be more
careful in the future so it

00:57.236 --> 01:00.605
doesn't happen again.
(sighs)

01:00.773 --> 01:04.108
Yeah, of course.
Yeah, 'cause...

01:04.277 --> 01:06.578
Yeah, that should never happen
again.

01:06.696 --> 01:08.937
Look, the thing is, it was the
best sex I ever had, okay?

01:09.031 --> 01:11.116
Hands down.
TACO: Wow, I thought the only

01:11.250 --> 01:13.285
disease that was good for sex
was low self-esteem.

01:13.452 --> 01:15.787
I know, it's crazy, but there
is nothing that can beat

01:15.955 --> 01:17.956
epileptic sex.
KEVIN: She's just epi-sexy.

01:18.124 --> 01:20.625
Yeah, super epi-sexy.
But I can't just be like,

01:20.760 --> 01:24.546
"Well, let's hang out again and
maybe, like, we'll get lucky and

01:24.680 --> 01:27.098
there'll be a seizure."
Like, that's not appropriate.

01:27.216 --> 01:29.601
ANDRE: Hey, guys.
What are you talking about?

01:29.719 --> 01:32.971
Well, you now.
Oh, these things?

01:33.139 --> 01:35.023
Yeah, I need them.
You don't need them.

01:35.141 --> 01:36.775
Take them off.
Those are prescribed?

01:36.892 --> 01:38.893
100%.
By an actual doctor?

01:39.028 --> 01:41.146
I am a doctor.
You're not an eye doctor.

01:41.280 --> 01:43.615
All right, you know what?
Guys, Andre obviously went to an

01:43.733 --> 01:46.234
eye doctor who diagnosed him
with lame eye.

01:46.369 --> 01:48.737
I don't have lame eye.
Well, let's hope not, because

01:48.871 --> 01:51.790
I want your vision 100% clear
this weekend when my team kicks

01:51.907 --> 01:54.159
your team's ass.
How have you gotten by in

01:54.293 --> 01:56.961
this life without glasses or
contacts?

01:57.079 --> 01:59.164
I think it was kind of like a
Daredevil thing.

01:59.332 --> 02:01.499
I just, you know, felt by sonar.
All right, bullshit.

02:01.667 --> 02:03.585
Let's test your eyesight.
Take your glasses off.

02:03.719 --> 02:05.587
Okay, sure.
How many fingers am I holding

02:05.721 --> 02:07.806
up?
I don't know, Jenny.

02:07.923 --> 02:10.175
Wow, I guess he really does
need them.

02:10.342 --> 02:13.011
Oh, God, it's Taco.
You-you can obviously hear

02:13.145 --> 02:15.180
his voice.
Well, he could have lame ear,

02:15.314 --> 02:17.315
too.
Guys, I am falling apart, but

02:17.433 --> 02:20.681
at least I look fashionable
doing it.

02:22.355 --> 02:23.550
(exhaling loudly)

02:23.670 --> 02:28.897

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

02:29.195 --> 02:31.246
JENNY: All right.
Here you go, guys.

02:31.364 --> 02:33.581
Thank you.
You-you guys excited for the

02:33.699 --> 02:35.700
sleepover?
I am ecstat...

02:35.868 --> 02:38.920
Oh, my gosh, I spilled it.
No, honey, it's okay.

02:39.038 --> 02:40.705
It's fine.
I'll just wash it and I'll send

02:40.873 --> 02:42.674
it home with you tomorrow, okay?
Thank you.

02:42.792 --> 02:46.711
Buddy, are you all good here?
You go play.

02:46.846 --> 02:49.013
Hey, guess who invited
himself over for dinner.

02:49.131 --> 02:51.800
Hey.
Hello. Ooh, Chinese.

02:51.934 --> 02:53.718
Where'd you get it from?
Oh, Mom made it.

02:53.853 --> 02:55.353
Her chow mein is the best thing
she makes.

02:55.471 --> 02:57.138
Jenny doesn't make Chinese food.

02:57.273 --> 02:58.890
What? No, I do.
She does.

02:59.058 --> 03:00.892
Let me show you how I made it
in the kitchen.

03:01.026 --> 03:03.645
Go in the kitchen.
Shh!

03:03.779 --> 03:05.697
Listen, listen.
Listen, Andre, ever since

03:05.815 --> 03:08.817
Ellie was a little girl, we
would order Chinese food, and I

03:08.951 --> 03:11.236
would serve it to her and I
would say, "Look at what Mommy

03:11.404 --> 03:13.988
made," and she would go, "Mmm,
Mommy, this is so good."

03:14.123 --> 03:16.574
She loves it.
And now she's, like, super

03:16.742 --> 03:18.960
proud of me, and I can't break
her heart.

03:19.078 --> 03:20.962
This is a very sad fairy tale
you've dreamed.

03:21.080 --> 03:22.997
Andre, you want to stay for
this dinner, you got to go along

03:23.132 --> 03:25.083
with the long con.
Sounds more like the,

03:25.251 --> 03:28.086
uh, won con.
What?

03:28.254 --> 03:30.305
Or won con soup?
We're not laughing because

03:30.423 --> 03:32.590
this is serious, Andre.
We're also not laughing

03:32.758 --> 03:34.893
because that's a stupid joke.
Oh, I see, uh, ancient

03:35.010 --> 03:36.978
Chinese secret.
You know what, you didn't see

03:37.096 --> 03:38.847
anything.
Now, stop it!

03:38.981 --> 03:40.598
Okay, I got to go the bathroom.

03:40.733 --> 03:42.684
Is there an elaborate story
behind that?

03:42.818 --> 03:44.936
Is there a special toilet genie
that's collecting poop and pee

03:45.070 --> 03:47.605
to bring back to his village?
No, just no wipes.

03:47.773 --> 03:49.691
You don't have to tell me
that twice.

03:49.825 --> 03:53.661
Don't you need your glasses?
Oh, door.

03:53.779 --> 03:56.331
Stop doing that, Andre.
Where am I?

03:56.449 --> 03:59.584
Oh, Jenny, remind me, next week
will you make some of your

03:59.702 --> 04:03.955
famous Big Macs?
Oh, sorry.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:14.934 --> 04:16.801
Oh, who's that?
Excuse me?

04:16.935 --> 04:19.019
Who is that?
Oh, big head, low hair line.

04:19.137 --> 04:21.105
Kevin!
Yes.

04:21.223 --> 04:23.308
How are you?
Well, not good, considering I

04:23.442 --> 04:25.560
just saw you staring at my scout
team.

04:25.694 --> 04:27.278
Every player that I'm
pinpointing.

04:27.396 --> 04:29.531
Basically, my whole strategy for
the year.

04:29.648 --> 04:31.616
Oh, good thing I didn't have
my glasses, 'cause I-I'm as

04:31.734 --> 04:33.651
blind as a bat.
I mean, I thought that was an

04:33.786 --> 04:35.537
abacus.
And considering your past of

04:35.654 --> 04:37.872
cheating this year, I would
think that you would really,

04:37.990 --> 04:40.325
really be very careful before
you considered a second

04:40.459 --> 04:42.577
infraction.
That's why it's so good that

04:42.711 --> 04:44.546
I didn't wear my glasses, 'cause
I am blind.

04:44.663 --> 04:46.331
Good.
I'm telling you, I didn't see

04:46.465 --> 04:50.635
a...
Great, 'cause we're playing

04:50.753 --> 04:52.670
each other this week.
Remember that, and I would want

04:52.805 --> 04:55.557
everything to be above board.
Absolutely.

04:55.674 --> 04:57.559
Okay, bathroom's that way.

05:03.272 --> 05:06.904
So, what do you want to do?
Want to watch TV?

05:07.540 --> 05:08.944
Okay.
Great.

05:10.331 --> 05:13.583
What's wrong with your TV?
I don't know.

05:13.701 --> 05:15.619
Did you pay the bill?
It's football season.

05:15.753 --> 05:17.621
I paid my bill.
I tell you what, you just keep

05:17.788 --> 05:19.623
watching the TV, and I'll cycle
through all the inputs, okay?

05:19.790 --> 05:21.541
Okay.
Item one.

05:21.676 --> 05:23.627
It's HDMI one.
Item two.

05:23.794 --> 05:27.130
Nope, nope, just turn it off.
How about some music?

05:27.265 --> 05:29.466
Okay.
You're gonna like this.

05:29.634 --> 05:31.074
Okay.
(aggressive rock music playing)

05:31.185 --> 05:33.470
Yeah!
What is this?

05:33.604 --> 05:35.522
This is my jam.
This is, like, murder music.

05:35.640 --> 05:38.225
I spin to this.
That's worse!

05:38.359 --> 05:40.777
You got to watch the
visualizer and listen to it.

05:40.895 --> 05:43.146
I can't listen to this one
second more.

05:43.314 --> 05:45.899
Well, you got to...
That's the worst thing I've

05:46.033 --> 05:48.118
ever heard in my life.
I'm trying to set the mood.

05:48.236 --> 05:50.654
Well, you don't need to set
the mood.

05:50.821 --> 05:53.156
I'm here and I'm already in the
mood.

05:53.324 --> 05:56.493
You know what, it's a good thing
we didn't do this last night.

05:56.627 --> 05:58.745
Why?
I had another stupid seizure.

05:58.879 --> 06:01.915
Last night?
That sucks.

06:02.049 --> 06:04.718
That you're having these
seizures, and I'm not there with

06:04.835 --> 06:07.637
you.
But the good news is it's

06:07.755 --> 06:10.090
never happened to me two days in
a row.

06:10.224 --> 06:13.009
Oh, good.
So we are good to go.

06:16.681 --> 06:19.015
Come on.
All right.

06:19.150 --> 06:21.484
So we had sex, and, you know, it
was pretty great.

06:21.602 --> 06:26.573
It just wasn't...
So normal sex isn't good for

06:26.691 --> 06:28.692
you anymore.
You just wants epi-sex.

06:28.859 --> 06:31.695
Kind of.
Well, once you figure out

06:31.862 --> 06:33.913
what you want, all you have to
do is be honest with her.

06:34.031 --> 06:36.449
Honesty is the best policy.
Right, Andre?

06:36.584 --> 06:38.535
Yeah, that's why they call me
Honest Andre.

06:38.669 --> 06:40.620
By the way, that was a great
pickup with Juwan Thompson.

06:40.755 --> 06:43.039
Oh, yeah, right?
Broncos v. the Rams?

06:43.207 --> 06:45.458
Forget it.
Forget about it.

06:45.593 --> 06:47.633
That guy's gonna destroy.
You know what's surprising

06:47.712 --> 06:49.546
is he's only owned in 19% of
leagues.

06:49.714 --> 06:52.182
I-I actually had him on my scout
team, but I didn't have the

06:52.300 --> 06:54.467
stones to pull the trigger.
But you did, Andre.

06:54.602 --> 06:57.053
How'd you do it?
Anyway, I would say, just be

06:57.188 --> 06:59.522
truthful.
I did the research.

06:59.640 --> 07:01.975
Great.
I'm gonna get a drink.

07:02.109 --> 07:06.146
Anyone want a drink?
Honestly, I-I couldn't.

07:06.280 --> 07:09.616
Okay.
God, that son of a bitch.

07:09.734 --> 07:13.069
I caught him looking at my scout
team without his glasses.

07:13.204 --> 07:15.872
Oh.
Yeah, yeah, I'm pulling a

07:15.990 --> 07:18.458
guilt con on Andre.
Just gonna play up the honesty

07:18.576 --> 07:20.794
theme.
Honesty, okay, let me try it.

07:20.911 --> 07:24.831
Uh, Kevin, "You're a really good
brother," is a phrase that's

07:24.965 --> 07:27.000
been a lie every time I've said
it.

07:27.134 --> 07:29.169
Oh.
Whew, what a load off.

07:29.303 --> 07:31.421
Yeah, this feels good.
You know what else feels

07:31.589 --> 07:33.556
good?
Someone's mouth on my wiener!

07:33.674 --> 07:35.925
Rafi's here.
Yeah.

07:36.060 --> 07:38.144
Look at this guy, right?
Who wants another round?

07:38.262 --> 07:40.647
Guys, I'm buying.
My women's self-defense class is

07:40.765 --> 07:42.899
making me pretty flush right
now.

07:43.017 --> 07:45.518
Oh, God, PYH.
Protect Your Holes, my

07:45.653 --> 07:48.822
self-defense course for women,
has exploded in popularity.

07:48.939 --> 07:52.609
I'm even teaching a self-defense
self-defense class where I teach

07:52.777 --> 07:56.413
the guys how to defend
themselves against the defense

07:56.530 --> 07:58.448
techniques that I've taught the
girls.

07:58.582 --> 08:00.582
Oh, so this new class is,
like, Protect Your Poles?

08:00.584 --> 08:03.119
Ooh, Brian, that is we're
best friends, man.

08:03.254 --> 08:05.955
You're the only person I care
about, and I would straight-up

08:06.123 --> 08:07.957
stab the other three of these
guys and take off with you

08:08.125 --> 08:09.959
right now.
You're running a class that's

08:10.127 --> 08:12.045
highly offensive to women.
Oh, no, in fact, it's highly

08:12.179 --> 08:14.047
defensive.
It's a self-defense class,

08:14.181 --> 08:15.515
Brian.
Duh!

08:15.633 --> 08:17.467
The best part of the whole
thing is I do it in bullet time.

08:17.601 --> 08:19.469
Please tell me you're not
shooting bullets at your class.

08:19.603 --> 08:21.471
I'm talking about bullet time
from <i> The Matrix.</i>

08:21.639 --> 08:24.474
Where the guy, Lord Elrond from
<i>Lord of the Rings</i> is shooting a

08:24.608 --> 08:26.726
gun at the dude from <i> The Lake</i>
<i>House,</i> and the dude from <i> The</i>

08:26.861 --> 08:28.945
<i>Lake House</i> is all, like...
Whoa!

08:29.063 --> 08:31.197
And all the bullets are just,
like, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew!

08:31.315 --> 08:34.701
And they all miss him.
So what I do is I take, like, a

08:34.818 --> 08:38.488
whole bunch of speed, I get all
ramped up, and then I'm moving

08:38.621 --> 08:41.039
in regular time, and everybody
else is moving in slow-motion.

08:41.158 --> 08:45.161
And I'm like, booge, booge,
buh-booge, buh-booge, buh-booge.

08:45.296 --> 08:47.997
Wait a minute.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:48.165 --> 08:49.999
Easy, Rafi.
That's self-defense.

08:50.167 --> 08:52.001
No, it's not.
You're having sex with them.

08:52.169 --> 08:54.137
I think I'm...
Tall Guy, come at me.

08:54.255 --> 08:56.096
I don't really need to...
Tall Guy, come at me!

08:56.173 --> 08:57.974
Am I supposed to be the man
or the woman?

08:58.092 --> 09:00.176
Doesn't matter.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:00.311 --> 09:02.812
No, no, no!
(shouting)

09:02.930 --> 09:04.848
Stop!
You want me to stop?

09:05.015 --> 09:06.850
Yes!
See, first mistake.

09:07.017 --> 09:09.102
That's consent.
Protect your holes, Pete.

09:09.236 --> 09:11.404
And your pole.
He'd be putting up way more

09:11.522 --> 09:13.690
of a fight if he didn't like it.
Get off, Rafi.

09:13.824 --> 09:15.909
(mumbling)
He's fine.

09:16.026 --> 09:18.445
We're just having fun.
No, we're not having fun.

09:18.579 --> 09:21.197
You're taking it too far, Rafi.
(groans)

09:21.332 --> 09:23.616
Are those your mints?
Yes, these are my mints,

09:23.751 --> 09:25.452
Rafi.
Okay, is this your pocket

09:25.586 --> 09:26.953
dog?
No, it's not my pocket dog,

09:27.087 --> 09:28.838
Rafi.
Oh, guess it's mine.

09:28.956 --> 09:30.874
How are your holes?
Unprotected.

09:31.041 --> 09:33.176
I could've been inside you in,
like, a second.

09:33.294 --> 09:35.929
To be fair, I didn't teach you
the final move in self-defense

09:36.046 --> 09:38.465
self-defense.
Self-de-feces.

09:38.599 --> 09:40.717
Excuse me?
It's a protective shit.

09:40.851 --> 09:43.720
When someone's trying to get in,
you start sending something out.

09:43.854 --> 09:46.473
You can't just decide to take
a shit.

09:46.607 --> 09:48.892
It's a three-step process.
One, think about taking a shit.

09:49.059 --> 09:52.645
Two, relax your sphincter.
Three, oh...

09:52.780 --> 09:55.064
(groans)
Oh, no.

09:55.199 --> 09:57.200
What?
Oh, boy.

09:57.318 --> 09:59.235
This isn't my bad, guys.
My God, Rafi!

09:59.370 --> 10:02.322
Get out of here!
No, it's okay. It's okay.

10:04.983 --> 10:07.565
Mrs. MacArthur, I wanted to
tell you about a fun project we

10:07.685 --> 10:09.805
have going on at the school,
where the kids take turns

10:09.853 --> 10:12.134
bringing in their favorite
family recipes for the class to

10:12.222 --> 10:14.107
enjoy and share.
Oh, that is fun.

10:14.224 --> 10:16.109
And next week is Ellie's turn.

10:16.226 --> 10:18.111
Oh!
I want you to make your

10:18.228 --> 10:20.446
world-famous chow mein.
Your chow mein is just

10:20.564 --> 10:23.700
extraordinary.
Oh, wow.

10:23.817 --> 10:26.235
Please make the chow mein.
That is very culturally

10:26.403 --> 10:28.621
adventurous of you.
Yeah, I am pretty darn

10:28.739 --> 10:31.157
adventurous.
Okay, I'm gonna pencil you in

10:31.291 --> 10:33.209
for next week.
Great.

10:33.327 --> 10:35.461
Alison! Hi, sweetheart.
Hi.

10:35.579 --> 10:38.748
Oh, why don't you get your
bag, Ellie.

10:38.882 --> 10:41.584
Can I talk to your mom alone?
Hey, Cheryl.

10:41.752 --> 10:43.653
Hi.
I hope Alison had fun at the

10:43.787 --> 10:45.972
sleepover the other night.
Actually, I think that she

10:46.090 --> 10:48.641
had a little too much fun.
She came home smelling strongly

10:48.759 --> 10:52.595
of, um...
marijuana.

10:52.763 --> 10:54.680
No.
Yes.

10:54.815 --> 10:57.483
Really? Oh, Cheryl.
She's so young to start using.

10:57.601 --> 11:01.487
(laughs)
A-Alison is not using.

11:01.605 --> 11:06.275
Someone in your house is using.
Honey, let's go get some ice

11:06.410 --> 11:09.078
cream, huh?
Does she have the munchies?

11:09.196 --> 11:13.149
(sighs)
Kevin, there's been a lot of

11:13.283 --> 11:15.803
distrust between us, and that's
why I propose that this week, we

11:15.836 --> 11:20.256
set each other's lineup.
I like that idea, Andre.

11:20.374 --> 11:22.458
It's like a fantasy football
trust fall.

11:22.626 --> 11:25.044
I'm glad that you like this.
And I kind of just started

11:25.179 --> 11:27.046
playing around here, and I got
all your guys in there.

11:27.181 --> 11:29.132
Looks great. I'll take it so.
You trust me?

11:29.299 --> 11:31.184
I trust you.
Submit.

11:31.301 --> 11:33.219
Great, well, then submit.
Lineup locked.

11:33.353 --> 11:35.721
Okay, so now, let's do your
lineup.

11:35.856 --> 11:38.524
You know what, I'm actually
getting a bit of glare off your

11:38.642 --> 11:41.227
glasses.
Let me just take these off.

11:41.361 --> 11:44.280
Just put these over here.
Well, I can't...

11:44.398 --> 11:46.649
I can't see without these.
That's not really an issue,

11:46.817 --> 11:49.318
though, Andre, because you trust
me, don't you?

11:49.486 --> 11:52.071
As I trusted you when you set my
lineup.

11:52.206 --> 11:54.073
(grunting)
Okay, who do you want to be your

11:54.208 --> 11:56.075
number one running back
this week?

11:56.210 --> 11:58.077
What about, uh, Eddie Lacy?
Yeah.

11:58.212 --> 11:59.629
You know, going to Philadelphia.

11:59.746 --> 12:01.914
He's gonna have a monster
week. Let's move Eddie Lacy

12:02.049 --> 12:04.467
up to your running back
position.

12:04.585 --> 12:08.304
Boom.
You okay?

12:08.422 --> 12:11.007
Uh, I feel like it looks like
a different name there.

12:11.141 --> 12:13.342
Well, don't strain yourself.
No, I'm not... Just...

12:13.477 --> 12:15.428
Andre, Andre, trust me.
Are you nearsighted or

12:15.562 --> 12:19.599
farsighted?
That's the thing, it goes in

12:19.733 --> 12:21.684
and out, that's the, uh, you
know?

12:21.819 --> 12:23.569
Mm-hmm.
I do have a question.

12:23.687 --> 12:25.354
Okay.
I feel like Eddie Lacy's

12:25.522 --> 12:26.939
such a small name...
Mm-hmm.

12:27.074 --> 12:28.407
...and this is like such a
big name there, right?

12:28.525 --> 12:30.193
That's my eyes, damn these eyes.
Hey.

12:30.360 --> 12:34.113
Look at me the best you can.
I trust you and I want you to

12:34.248 --> 12:37.083
trust me. So...
I trust you.

12:37.201 --> 12:39.952
Submit.
Huh? Let's shake on it, Andre.

12:40.087 --> 12:42.288
All right, come here.
Good job.

12:42.422 --> 12:44.207
Good talk.

12:46.593 --> 12:49.595
Shit.
(sniffing)

12:49.713 --> 12:52.381
What the...?
(sniffs)

12:52.549 --> 12:54.967
Oh, God!
Taco!

12:55.102 --> 12:57.470
What's up?
Why are you in my garage?

12:57.604 --> 13:00.273
I was eating.
No, what are you doing?

13:00.390 --> 13:03.609
Oh, come on...
Don't you know what running the

13:03.727 --> 13:06.062
dryer does to weed?
Oh, it's gonna smell like

13:06.230 --> 13:09.148
clothes now.
Are you using our dryer as a

13:09.283 --> 13:11.617
guest bong?
No, my guest bong's your fire

13:11.735 --> 13:13.903
extinguisher.
This is my guest stash.

13:14.071 --> 13:15.621
I was trying to be considerate
by putting it somewhere you

13:15.739 --> 13:18.074
don't use.
I use my dryer!

13:18.242 --> 13:20.122
I don't believe you.
Your kids are never wearing

13:20.160 --> 13:21.281
clean clothes.
You know what?

13:21.378 --> 13:22.699
I have bigger issues with my
kids.

13:22.746 --> 13:25.381
Do you know I have to cook chow
mein for Ellie's entire class?

13:25.499 --> 13:27.250
Oh, you're finally learning
how to cook?

13:27.384 --> 13:29.302
That's great, that's really
gonna help you find a man.

13:29.419 --> 13:31.420
I have a man.
Mmm...

13:31.588 --> 13:33.306
I need a recipe for chow mein.

13:33.423 --> 13:35.424
Oh, well, I know a really
good Chinese chef.

13:35.559 --> 13:37.343
You do?
He's my Eskimo stepbrother.

13:37.477 --> 13:39.095
Step...?
Yeah, we had sex with the

13:39.263 --> 13:42.064
same girl in an exercise class.
Ah.

13:42.199 --> 13:45.101
Welcome to the kitchen of
Ménage à Cinq.

13:45.269 --> 13:47.937
Everything is set up here for
our chow mein demonstration.

13:48.105 --> 13:50.239
Thank you so much for letting
us do this in your restaurant

13:50.357 --> 13:52.441
before it's even open.
It's a pleasure to have a

13:52.609 --> 13:55.077
master chef in here.
Everyone...

13:55.195 --> 13:57.530
Hey, guys.
This is Lee Wei Lee.

13:57.664 --> 14:00.116
Ah, Master Chef.
We are so excited to have you in

14:00.284 --> 14:03.035
our restaurant.
I'm gonna take off.

14:03.170 --> 14:05.955
There's an organic, three-penis
wine market that just opened up.

14:06.089 --> 14:09.041
I hear they sell wine from the
dicks of grass-fed animals.

14:09.176 --> 14:11.594
That's healthy.
See you guys later.

14:11.712 --> 14:15.131
Ah, Master Chef, I like your
glasses, eh?

14:15.265 --> 14:20.186
Great minds think alike?
Oh, I guess he wants to get us

14:20.304 --> 14:23.022
started. Okay.
Let's go. Okay.

14:23.140 --> 14:27.026
Ooh...
(sniffs)

14:27.144 --> 14:28.644
You know, I've read about this.

14:28.812 --> 14:31.314
What?
Master chefs don't often use

14:31.448 --> 14:34.150
utensils.
They just use their hands and...

14:34.318 --> 14:37.370
I'm so sorry, Master...
Boy!

14:37.487 --> 14:39.167
Oh, yes. Thank you.
Thank you, Master Chef.

14:39.206 --> 14:41.240
I think he likes... me.
How am I... how am I doing,

14:41.375 --> 14:44.493
chef, huh?
(Lee humming)

14:46.830 --> 14:48.998
Do I keep...
(Lee continues humming)

14:49.132 --> 14:51.300
Let him guide your hands.
(sniffing)

14:51.418 --> 14:52.969
Dude, it's okay if he smells
you.

14:53.086 --> 14:55.388
Thank you, chef.
(Lee grunting)

14:55.505 --> 14:58.674
Whoosh...
Yeah... okay, so... now we

14:58.809 --> 15:01.594
are... whoosh.
Ooh.

15:01.728 --> 15:04.680
This doesn't seem sanitary.
Hee!

15:04.815 --> 15:07.099
(laughing)
Okay.

15:07.234 --> 15:09.101
Okay.
You know, chef, I actually

15:09.236 --> 15:12.938
made my own noodles last night.
I was wondering if you would

15:13.073 --> 15:16.525
taste them and see how I did.
Try the noodles?

15:16.693 --> 15:21.030
(sniffs)
Oh...

15:21.164 --> 15:23.699
(Lee humming)
What are you...

15:23.834 --> 15:27.036
(Lee laughing)
Ooh, Lee Wei Lee's making his

15:27.170 --> 15:28.954
head noodles.
Those are good.

15:29.089 --> 15:31.507
Taco, what is this guy's deal?

15:31.625 --> 15:35.127
Is he... frittata?
Uh, yeah.

15:35.262 --> 15:37.296
I mean, look at him.
Why would you not tell me

15:37.431 --> 15:39.098
that?
What? 'Cause I don't

15:39.216 --> 15:42.101
stigmatize people like that.
I don't go around saying that

15:42.219 --> 15:44.103
about Chalupa Batman.
What?

15:44.221 --> 15:46.188
Come on, Lee Wei Lee, let's
get out of here.

15:46.306 --> 15:47.723
(Lee howls)
Yes, get away from these

15:47.858 --> 15:50.026
horrible people.
It's this way... it's...

15:50.143 --> 15:53.279
He can't see through the dough.
Just make holes in the dough.

15:53.397 --> 15:55.147
No wonder he kept on touching
the pot.

15:55.282 --> 15:56.949
And the worst part is, I thought
we were learning something.

15:57.067 --> 15:59.035
You did?
Yeah, very, like...

15:59.152 --> 16:00.903
Hi-yo!
Whoa.

16:01.038 --> 16:02.238
Look at this!
Wow.

16:02.406 --> 16:03.622
What is that?
Well, I heard you were

16:03.740 --> 16:06.325
opening a new kitchen, so I
brought you a toilet.

16:06.460 --> 16:08.244
Okay, get that out of here.
We cannot have that in the

16:08.378 --> 16:10.079
kitchen.
But what happens when the

16:10.213 --> 16:12.965
guys who are preparing the food
need to take a shit?

16:13.083 --> 16:15.301
They go to the bathroom.
Oh, what, so they're gonna

16:15.419 --> 16:17.303
pick up all this stuff they're
working with, bring it to the

16:17.421 --> 16:19.472
bathroom so they can keep
working while they go?

16:19.589 --> 16:21.424
Okay, you know what?
Duly noted.

16:21.558 --> 16:23.926
That guy that just left--
pasta for hair, dough for face?

16:24.094 --> 16:26.095
Yeah.
That's Lee Wei Lee, isn't it?

16:26.229 --> 16:27.596
Yeah.
Yes, it was.

16:27.764 --> 16:29.348
I knew it.
That guy's dating my

16:29.483 --> 16:31.100
ex-girlfriend.
What?

16:31.234 --> 16:33.319
Gail, the human garbage can?
Swimming instructor?

16:33.437 --> 16:35.104
Yeah, and it's making me crazy.

16:35.272 --> 16:39.191
No, see, this guy is...
mentally challenged.

16:39.326 --> 16:41.026
(laughs) I don't like him,
either.

16:41.161 --> 16:43.612
But apparently, he's some bigwig
in the restaurant biz.

16:43.780 --> 16:45.614
He's got a chauffer that drives
him around in this, like, little

16:45.749 --> 16:47.450
yellow bus everywhere.
Meanwhile, you know, I'm riding

16:47.617 --> 16:50.419
a ten-speed that I stole from an
11-year-old.

16:53.516 --> 16:55.851
Ugh. Pittsburgh-Tennessee.
This game is as low-scoring as

16:56.018 --> 16:58.570
your team, Andre.
Ha. Great.

16:58.688 --> 17:00.906
God, Taco.
Because of you, now I have to

17:01.023 --> 17:04.709
learn how to cook this stupid
chow mein all by myself.

17:04.829 --> 17:06.709
Okay, why don't you just
order the Chinese food?

17:06.748 --> 17:09.083
No one will know.
Ellie has to document my

17:09.217 --> 17:12.252
process for her class, so I have
to look like I know what I'm

17:12.387 --> 17:13.837
doing.
Well, even though you guys

17:13.972 --> 17:16.673
are horrible, narrow-minded
people, Lee Wei Lee offered to

17:16.840 --> 17:18.642
help you guys again.
No.

17:18.760 --> 17:20.511
Yeah, apparently he liked the
way you smell, so...

17:20.645 --> 17:23.180
Mmm. No, thank you.
Hey, that's a compliment.

17:23.314 --> 17:25.482
Oh, Andre, this is so terrible.

17:25.599 --> 17:27.684
I'm sorry.
96 to 43?

17:27.819 --> 17:29.520
You didn't pick any of the
players I asked for.

17:29.654 --> 17:31.374
I guess my vision's just a
little bit foggy.

17:31.489 --> 17:32.740
You know what?
Maybe I need glasses, too.

17:32.857 --> 17:34.324
That could be it.
No. You know what?

17:34.442 --> 17:36.202
I'm getting a beer.
Give me your eye doctor's

17:36.277 --> 17:39.446
phone number, Andre.
(Rafi screaming)

17:39.581 --> 17:41.198
Oh, God!
Oh, thank God you're here.

17:41.366 --> 17:43.700
What is going on?
I've got a B.D.E.

17:43.835 --> 17:45.369
What is that?
I've got a broken dick

17:45.537 --> 17:47.121
emergency.
I need to see a doctor.

17:47.255 --> 17:49.089
Where's Andre?
There.

17:49.207 --> 17:53.093
Andre?
Andre, look at this!

17:53.211 --> 17:55.212
Andre, look at this!
Oh, my God!

17:55.380 --> 17:57.214
Look at this!
My God, Rafi, stop!

17:57.382 --> 17:59.633
(Rafi shouting)
Look at this, Andre!

17:59.768 --> 18:02.136
It's leaking!
Oh... oh, God, oh, God, oh,

18:02.270 --> 18:03.720
God.
Don't walk away, Andre!

18:03.888 --> 18:06.723
Oh, my God.
Some things you cannot unsee.

18:06.891 --> 18:09.251
Only if you see them first.
You're not wearing your glasses,

18:09.310 --> 18:12.396
Andre.
Ah ha ha ha!

18:12.530 --> 18:15.199
No?
Ah, the gig is up.

18:15.316 --> 18:17.117
Well, you all fell prey to my
elaborate hoax.

18:17.235 --> 18:18.485
No, we didn't.
No.

18:18.620 --> 18:20.204
What, you didn't fall for it?
No.

18:20.321 --> 18:21.682
You knew the whole time?
Of course.

18:21.706 --> 18:23.323
So the whole honesty thing,
that wasn't real?

18:23.458 --> 18:25.325
So, wait, we don't have to be
honest anymore?

18:25.460 --> 18:27.744
No.
I love you guys.

18:27.912 --> 18:31.131
Ohh... okay.
Feel a little bit better now.

18:31.249 --> 18:33.801
That was disgusting.
What is going on down there?

18:33.918 --> 18:35.636
Yeah, right?
I was teaching my self-defense

18:35.753 --> 18:38.088
class and one of those girls,
she really caught me with a

18:38.256 --> 18:40.090
shiv.
Right at the base, too.

18:40.258 --> 18:42.342
And I was real hard.
You know how much blood's in

18:42.477 --> 18:44.261
your dick when you're real hard?
So all that just came pouring

18:44.429 --> 18:45.429
right out.
Ugh...

18:45.563 --> 18:47.064
But I think I got it settled
down now.

18:47.182 --> 18:50.517
How?
I opened up your mayo, ga

18:50.652 --> 18:52.972
And mayonnaise has healing
properties, the Indians used it.

18:52.987 --> 18:54.605
What happened to that whole
bullet time thing?

18:54.772 --> 18:57.107
Exactly! Right?
I took, like, 45 of these things

18:57.242 --> 19:00.661
and nothing happened.
All I have now is fresh breath

19:00.778 --> 19:02.613
and a broken dick.

19:05.116 --> 19:06.583
Hang on, hang on.
What?

19:06.701 --> 19:08.118
I need more mints.
Pete, you're like 30 deep in

19:08.286 --> 19:10.246
those. Your breath is fine.
But these mints are so

19:10.288 --> 19:13.540
god damn good.
Okay, carpe diem! Seize the day!

19:13.675 --> 19:15.125
Come here!
(laughing)

19:15.293 --> 19:17.678
Okay!
Whoa.

19:17.795 --> 19:20.631
I'm feeling a little hot.
Yes, baby, you are hot.

19:20.765 --> 19:22.766
I'm in the clouds.
Yeah, you're in the clouds.

19:22.884 --> 19:25.135
Yeah?
(gibbering)

19:25.303 --> 19:27.387
Oh, God!
Oh, whatever you're doing, don't

19:27.522 --> 19:30.641
stop it.
Oh, my God, don't stop.

19:30.808 --> 19:35.979
Oh, my God, don't ever stop!
You're like Superman.

19:36.147 --> 19:40.701
Oh!
Oh...

19:40.818 --> 19:42.986
(laughing)

19:46.658 --> 19:50.661
Oh, my God, what was that?
I did not think you could make

19:50.795 --> 19:54.998
me feel that good.
Pete? Pete?

19:55.133 --> 19:57.668
Pete?
What?

19:57.835 --> 20:00.837
Pete, are you okay?
Did I miss the seizure?

20:04.008 --> 20:06.093
Oh...
Filthy.

20:06.227 --> 20:08.679
Godspeed, Jenny.
Godspeed those children's

20:08.846 --> 20:12.149
digestive systems.
Oh... where is it?

20:12.267 --> 20:14.768
Where is it?
Wait, did you sleep here last

20:14.903 --> 20:16.786
night, Taco?
I can't find it.

20:17.198 --> 20:18.645
Taco, what are you looking for?

20:18.765 --> 20:21.692
I don't understand, it was
right there. Where is it?

20:21.826 --> 20:24.444
What are you looking for?
No, no, no, no, no!

20:24.579 --> 20:25.920
Why would you do that?
My weed!

20:26.040 --> 20:28.498
Your wife stole it.
You sure it's not already in

20:28.616 --> 20:30.083
here?
Some of it, but not the most

20:30.201 --> 20:31.868
of it.
Well, where did you leave it

20:32.036 --> 20:33.040
last, Taco?
I hid it in the Chinese

20:33.160 --> 20:34.275
spices and now it's gone.

20:38.338 --> 20:42.864
Kids, this is chow mein,
courtesy of Mrs. MacArthur.

20:42.998 --> 20:45.366
Looks different, Mom.
Shh.

20:45.501 --> 20:48.503
Okay, enjoy.
Again, Sheryl, I am mortified

20:48.621 --> 20:51.706
about the whole clothes in the
dryer thing... I'm so sorry.

20:51.874 --> 20:53.424
Don't even... don't worry
about it.

20:53.542 --> 20:56.094
I have a mentally unstable
homeless brother-in-law, too.

20:56.211 --> 20:58.346
Oh. I feel like every family
has one.

20:58.464 --> 21:00.431
(Sheryl laughs)
I hope I can pull off this whole

21:00.549 --> 21:02.433
chow mein deal.
It's not up to my regular

21:02.551 --> 21:04.185
standards.
Oh, I don't know.

21:04.303 --> 21:05.887
I think people are really
enjoying it.

21:06.055 --> 21:07.972
Oh, my God.
This is the best chow mein of my

21:08.107 --> 21:09.857
life.
What is your secret?

21:09.975 --> 21:11.392
Is that cumin?
Uh...

21:11.527 --> 21:14.362
It's amazing, right?
It's amazing, it is amazing!

21:14.480 --> 21:17.031
Is this my body?
Am I weak?

21:17.149 --> 21:19.233
It's amazing.
Everything is cursive.

21:19.401 --> 21:23.237
Everything is cursive...
I feel like I fell off the

21:23.372 --> 21:25.239
world.
I'm so hungry.

21:25.374 --> 21:29.911
(laughing)
I'm falling.

21:30.045 --> 21:33.464
I hate geometry!
Ah!

21:33.582 --> 21:37.085
(laughing)
Oh, my...

21:37.252 --> 21:41.005
There's marijuana in here.
No, that's impossible.

21:41.140 --> 21:44.676
Is this what I think it is?
Oh, my God.

21:44.810 --> 21:49.764
(children laughing)
Kids, stop eating.

21:49.898 --> 21:52.767
Stop eating immediately.
She is never coming over to your

21:52.901 --> 21:55.236
house.
Ah...!

21:55.354 --> 22:00.325
(laughing)
I'm gonna get fired.

22:00.442 --> 22:04.912
I'm gonna get fired!
(laughing): I never liked you.

22:09.770 --> 22:11.578
(giggling)
Hey, Gail.

22:11.708 --> 22:13.709
Rafi.
What are you doing here?

22:13.827 --> 22:15.494
I realize now that even
though you're a piece of

22:15.629 --> 22:17.496
garbage, I shouldn't have thrown
you away.

22:17.664 --> 22:20.633
You know what, Rafi?
You're too little, too late,

22:20.751 --> 22:22.718
okay?
I'm with Lee Wei Lee now.

22:22.836 --> 22:24.670
Oh, come on!
What's he got that I don't have?

22:24.838 --> 22:28.257
This is a man of style, of
sophistication...

22:28.392 --> 22:32.061
There are times when we just
look into each other's eyes for

22:32.179 --> 22:38.317
hours... and just get lost.
He doesn't have to say anything.

22:38.435 --> 22:41.320
It's poetry in his eyes.
There's a real, like,

22:41.438 --> 22:44.440
powerful innocence there.
It's like he sees right... right

22:44.575 --> 22:46.993
into my heart.
He has empathy.

22:47.110 --> 22:48.694
Huh?
When a fire truck goes by, he

22:48.829 --> 22:51.364
starts shrieking...
(Lee shrieking)

22:51.531 --> 22:54.700
...and imitating it.
It's very, very loud.

22:54.868 --> 22:57.336
You know? Because he feels for
the people they're going to

22:57.454 --> 22:59.205
save.
I get it, Gail.

22:59.339 --> 23:01.958
He's-he's the total package.
Look, I'm not opposed to a

23:02.092 --> 23:06.596
three-way situation, here, but
I'm not leaving this for this.

23:06.713 --> 23:09.348
This guy clearly has
everything, but does he love you

23:09.466 --> 23:11.717
as much as I do?
Does he spend every waking

23:11.885 --> 23:15.104
minute of his life stalking you?
Does he wake up in the morning

23:15.222 --> 23:19.392
in your closet, sneak out, make
you breakfast and then hide in

23:19.526 --> 23:22.695
another closet so that he can
watch you eat that breakfast?

23:22.813 --> 23:24.730
That was you?
Of course that was me.

23:24.865 --> 23:26.449
Didn't you know?
I... no.

23:26.566 --> 23:28.401
No!
Whoa!

23:28.568 --> 23:32.038
Okay, guys, seriously, don't
fight over me.

23:32.155 --> 23:35.408
This ends now!
Okay!

23:35.575 --> 23:37.710
♪ ♪

23:43.583 --> 23:49.338
(grunting)
What? Whoa, what?

23:49.473 --> 23:51.724
There is so much slapping.
No!

23:51.842 --> 23:55.394
Ah!
(Lee laughs)

23:58.432 --> 24:03.319
(Rafi laughs)
(grunting)

24:03.437 --> 24:06.439
Oh!
Oh!

24:06.573 --> 24:09.692
They're killing each other!
For me!

24:09.826 --> 24:14.030
(grunting)
Go to sleep.

24:14.164 --> 24:16.115
(Lee grunts)
Does it... what?

24:16.249 --> 24:18.198
(sniffing)
What... what did you do?

24:18.318 --> 24:21.017
Self-defeces?
Oh, no, self-defeces?

24:21.173 --> 24:22.623
Yeah.
Oh, my God, he used my own

24:22.791 --> 24:23.953
move against me.
