05:27.493 --> 05:29.200
What you know about struggle?

of your natural life, brother

05:33.666 --> 05:36.169

- No, man, he doesn't rape him!

10:24.323 --> 10:26.826
Not all convicts are gay

10:30.730 --> 10:35.042

benefit by them.

You like plants

10:48.881 --> 10:52.055

16:46.071 --> 16:49.075
Now I heard you say you want
some kind of burger.

16:49.141 --> 16:52.884
There's a McDonald's about three,
four miles up the road there.

16:52.945 --> 16:55.289
You can get all
the chicken nuggets you want

16:55.347 --> 16:57.156

16:57.216 --> 16:59.662

17:01.854 --> 17:04.357

17:30.983 --> 17:32.462

17:49.802 --> 17:53.249
I want to thank y'all again

It is a done daughter.
Them rednecks must've caught 'em,

18:12.891 --> 18:16.100
then sodomized them
and murderized them.

18:16.161 --> 18:17.469
Oooh

18:17.529 --> 18:19.736
Man, what is it

18:19.798 --> 18:22.472

all these stories end, man

18:22.534 --> 18:24.480
They fuck you

18:24.536 --> 18:26.174
Nigga, ain't you seen "Deliverance
II?

18:26.238 --> 18:28.445
No, they don't get screwed or killed

18:28.507 --> 18:29.815
They get away

18:29.975 --> 18:32.353
- Itch, though, right?
- I don't think so, man

18:32.411 --> 18:34.357

18:36.582 --> 18:37.754
- No shit?

18:37.816 --> 18:39.796
Gotta shave all the hair

18:39.852 --> 18:41.661
- I had to shave my asshole
- Oooh.

18:41.720 --> 18:45.964
Howdy, cowboys!
Welcome to the Dixieland Hotel

18:59.938 --> 19:02.509
I'm gonna tell you
what you need: a good meal,

19:02.574 --> 19:04.485
a hot tub
and a nice warm bed

19:04.543 --> 19:06.352
to put that little head on

19:06.411 --> 19:08.982
That's what I'm talking about.
You gonna come put me in the bed?

19:09.047 --> 19:11.527
- Sounds good to you, doesn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

19:11.583 --> 19:13.460
What's it gonna be?

19:13.519 --> 19:16.090
Two rooms?
Or maybe one?

19:16.155 --> 19:18.362
- One.
- And is that gonna be

19:18.423 --> 19:20.903
two beds or one?

19:20.959 --> 19:22.632
- Bitch, two! What the fuck?

19:22.694 --> 19:26.904
Okay okay, I got to ask.
It doesn't happen very often,

19:26.965 --> 19:30.674
but every now and then we get
some of those life "partner" types

19:30.736 --> 19:33.546
- You know what I mean.
- No, there ain't nothing like this

19:33.605 --> 19:36.848
- We're definitely not life partners
- Okay.

19:36.909 --> 19:38.911
Now y'all want smoking

20:07.673 --> 20:09.983
She probably was fine

20:31.897 --> 20:33.604

is wanted for murder.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.616

20:41.673 --> 20:45.086
Yo yo yo yo,

Will Master Kush be hunted down

22:07.959 --> 22:09.939
and captured by the ICU?

22:09.995 --> 22:12.999
Will ICU propaganda
successfully tarnish

22:13.065 --> 22:16.171
the good name of Kush?
Will the ICU

22:16.234 --> 22:18.612
use their evil influence and release

22:18.670 --> 22:20.479
the dark energy into the world?

22:20.539 --> 22:24.385
Will fear, mass paranoia
and government conspiracy

22:24.443 --> 22:27.515
be the ultimate downfall of Master Kush?

22:27.579 --> 22:29.115
All this and more

22:29.181 --> 22:31.388
When Kush Comes to Shove

22:31.450 --> 22:34.090
- That hurt.
- M-M-Master Kush

23:00.345 --> 23:03.224
I'm having a meeting with the toilet

23:04.616 --> 23:06.459
You gonna have to hurry up, man

23:06.518 --> 23:08.054
What you doing?

23:08.120 --> 23:10.794
Making a decision

23:10.856 --> 23:13.462
You gotta
come back later, man

23:14.793 --> 23:17.330
Smoking up all the fucking weed
I know what he doing.

23:19.030 --> 23:21.738
Free up your mind and pull up
some fresh brew

23:21.800 --> 23:23.780
Blowing out my mind
cloud nine

23:23.835 --> 23:25.872
Where I stay,
so I blaze some weed

23:25.937 --> 23:27.610
We've been riding forever, man

23:27.672 --> 23:30.152
I'm tired of this shit.
What time we gonna get there?

23:30.208 --> 23:32.449
- Man, you know what?
- What?

23:32.511 --> 23:35.720
Before we get to where we're going, man,
I think we need to get some new gear.

23:35.781 --> 23:36.987
Think there gonna be
some mothers out there?

23:37.048 --> 23:40.427
No, nigga. I ain't-- I'm talking
about some clothes so we can fit in

23:40.485 --> 23:42.260
So we won't stick out
as much, man.

23:42.320 --> 23:43.890
Like what?
What type of gear?

23:43.955 --> 23:46.697
Shit, I don't know.
What do country motherfuckers wear?

23:48.126 --> 23:50.265
Cowboy shit?

23:50.328 --> 23:52.308
Yeah, I guess

23:53.565 --> 23:55.101
Man, when we get
up in here, man,

23:55.167 --> 23:57.340
make sure you play it cool

23:57.402 --> 23:59.905
Don't be doing shit that'll
bring attention to us, man

23:59.971 --> 24:02.042
Come on, dawg

24:02.107 --> 24:04.553
I 9011 you

24:04.609 --> 24:06.611
All of you freaks

24:06.678 --> 24:08.954
And all of you boozers

24:09.014 --> 24:10.823
All of you cheats

24:10.882 --> 24:13.055
Emil

24:13.118 --> 24:15.189
Yeee--

24:15.253 --> 24:16.857
--haw

24:16.922 --> 24:19.368
Hey there,
Boom Boom Belinda

24:20.892 --> 24:22.997
Let me get some of that--
both of them.

24:23.061 --> 24:25.940
It's another lost weekend
stuck in this town...

24:25.997 --> 24:27.203
He ain't gonna need this

24:27.265 --> 24:28.642
Hey, where you going?
Where you going?

24:28.700 --> 24:30.441
Where you going?
Where you going?

24:33.238 --> 24:36.082
You can get that two in that
corner pocket if you just go at it.

24:38.610 --> 24:40.055
Smile!

24:42.514 --> 24:43.993
I like that.
Let me get it

24:44.049 --> 24:45.551
Okay, babe

24:52.357 --> 24:54.837
Give them a little "Whoa,

24:54.893 --> 24:57.169
ho ho ho!"

25:03.368 --> 25:05.075
Hey, come on, man
You're crazy.

25:05.136 --> 25:06.308
Listen to me.
You're tripping

25:10.575 --> 25:14.022
- Can I get you guys something to drink?
- Yeah.

25:14.079 --> 25:18.391
Let me get a li'l sarsaparilla

25:18.450 --> 25:20.828
Knock off that cowboy shit

25:20.886 --> 25:23.059
This ain't the place

25:25.924 --> 25:29.235
Oh. My bad

25:31.429 --> 25:33.375
Now if you're looking for some reefer,

25:33.431 --> 25:35.741
stick around till after we close

25:37.068 --> 25:39.309
- For sure
- Whoo.

26:00.125 --> 26:02.401
Uh, was that drunk bitch pregnant

26:02.460 --> 26:04.497
or was that pregnant bitch drunk?

26:13.405 --> 26:17.012
- Is that what I think it is?
- Oh, yeah yeah.

26:24.950 --> 26:27.430
Bring it here.
Come here, come on, come on in

26:27.485 --> 26:30.989
Now let me guess.
You guys are here

26:31.056 --> 26:33.468
- looking for crops
- How you know?

26:33.525 --> 26:36.062
The only black cowboys I know

26:36.127 --> 26:38.129
play football in Dallas

26:38.196 --> 26:40.676
mama

26:40.732 --> 26:43.144
Yeah well, shit.
What's up with the trees then, man?

26:43.201 --> 26:45.875
My man here said they got acres
of that shit growing out here.

26:45.937 --> 26:49.180
- That's an understatement
- Fuck.

26:49.240 --> 26:52.687
Kentucky yields
the most marijuana crops

26:52.744 --> 26:55.054
in the nation

26:55.113 --> 26:57.821
If you're driving through,
just roll down your windows

26:57.882 --> 26:59.953
- You could smell it in the air
- No shit.

27:00.018 --> 27:03.124
I thought I smelled it.
When I was on my way up there

27:03.188 --> 27:06.169
- I did smell it.
- That's 'cause we was smoking on one

27:08.059 --> 27:10.300
You ain't wrong when you're right

27:10.362 --> 27:14.674
Let me guess:
you guys came up in here

27:14.733 --> 27:16.576
in hopes of finding
one of those crops?

27:16.635 --> 27:18.546
Snatching a couple of pounds

27:18.603 --> 27:20.674
and going down to sell it in the hood

27:20.739 --> 27:23.276
You're damn right, Iron Sheik

27:25.710 --> 27:28.054
Oh, I get it

27:28.113 --> 27:31.390
You're the funny one.
Well, we'll see how funny you are

27:31.449 --> 27:34.055
when one of these hillbillies
has a cow prod up your ass,

27:34.119 --> 27:36.963
forcing you to drink ice water
and chew on aluminum foil.

27:37.022 --> 27:40.060
My booty hole just started burning
What type of gay shit?

27:41.860 --> 27:43.362
All right, man,
for real, man.

27:43.428 --> 27:45.237
Can you tell us
where the crops are?

27:45.296 --> 27:48.140
Well, you gotta be a little
more specific than that.

27:48.199 --> 27:50.975
You just don't walk into McDonald's
and say "I want a hamburger."

27:51.036 --> 27:53.676
- You got the Barack Obama?
- What kind they got?

27:53.738 --> 27:56.275
- EL Presidential
- It all depends

27:56.341 --> 27:58.150
on how far are you
willing to go.

27:58.209 --> 28:00.120
I mean you can hike
for about a day

28:00.178 --> 28:02.283
and find a pretty decent
chronic crop.

28:02.347 --> 28:07.057
But if you're willing to dodge
a couple of bullets

28:07.118 --> 28:09.120
- and booby traps
- Mm-hmm.

28:09.187 --> 28:11.929
You can find that sticky green,

28:11.990 --> 28:14.061
crystallized,

28:14.125 --> 28:16.071
extraterrestrial-type shit

28:16.127 --> 28:19.199
that shit that tastes like candy
when you smoke it.

28:19.264 --> 28:20.902
Oh shit, I'm up in that

28:20.965 --> 28:23.741
Man, did you hear what
he said before that shit?

28:23.802 --> 28:26.442
Man, I'm not fucking with no bullets
or no booby traps, man.

28:26.504 --> 28:28.484
Can you tell us how to get
to one of the ones, like,

28:28.540 --> 28:30.520
right off one
of these roads somewhere?

28:30.575 --> 28:32.452
All right, all right,
but trust me.

28:32.510 --> 28:35.354
You'll be back

28:35.413 --> 28:37.654
Can I get some
of that now? Shit

28:37.716 --> 28:40.595
Y'all done passed it back and forth
like y'all know each other.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.359
So what the guys didn't know

28:44.422 --> 28:47.665
was that I was waiting
for this opportunity for years

28:51.262 --> 28:54.402
- What opportunity?
- My sweet little baby girl

28:54.466 --> 28:57.970
my daughter Marie--
she was held captive

28:58.036 --> 29:00.414
by sick, sadistic hillbillies

29:00.472 --> 29:02.918
- A group of them
- Oh, I get it.

29:02.974 --> 29:06.421
So he get him a piece of that
young hillbilly kinootchi

29:06.478 --> 29:07.980
while he up there, fuck around

29:08.046 --> 29:10.788
and leave a seed
in the background, huh?

29:10.849 --> 29:13.796
- Exactly.
- Should've pulled out

29:13.852 --> 29:16.696
I'd do it.
Called the rhythm method

29:16.755 --> 29:18.462
or some shit like that

29:18.523 --> 29:21.402
I tried several times to free her,

29:21.459 --> 29:23.461
but it didn't work out

29:23.528 --> 29:25.974
Damn, that's fucked up

29:26.030 --> 29:28.874
Yeah, so I seen these guys
as the perfect opportunity

29:28.933 --> 29:32.540
to set her free, but first I had
to bait the hook a little.

29:37.542 --> 29:40.421
Man, where in the hell
this fool Sanchez send us, man?

29:40.478 --> 29:43.687
I don't know. He said
look for the Highway 420 sign

29:45.650 --> 29:48.324
There it is right there
That's it right there.

29:48.386 --> 29:50.059
Let's do this shit

29:51.089 --> 29:52.966
Come on, let's go

29:54.993 --> 29:57.371
- You hear this shit?
- This is the forest, nigga.

29:57.428 --> 29:59.931
Man, let's just be rappers.
Let's go back home, let's be rappers

29:59.998 --> 30:01.807
Man, come on, man.
Bring your scary-ass on, man

30:01.866 --> 30:03.937
- Let's go, man
- Eh, shit!

30:04.002 --> 30:05.174
Fucking with you

30:09.808 --> 30:12.789
Okay, according to Sanchez,
there should be somewhere

30:12.844 --> 30:16.189
- to camp right up in here somewhere
- Camp?! Hold up, hold up.

30:16.247 --> 30:19.057
The fuck you mean "camp"?
Black people don't camp.

30:20.752 --> 30:23.028
We cook out. We picnic

30:23.087 --> 30:25.658
We party, have a good time,
get on that cocaine and leave

30:25.723 --> 30:27.964
You got me fucked up, nigga.
I'm gonna stay out of this motherfucker

30:28.026 --> 30:29.664
I ain't gonna be
on nobody's news. Shit

30:29.727 --> 30:31.502
Man, you trying to get
this weed or what, man?

30:31.563 --> 30:35.238
Now if I can remember correctly,
this was your idea from the beginning

30:35.300 --> 30:37.746
- Not this part.
- Shit, man, I don't know about you,

30:37.802 --> 30:40.510
man, but I'm tired of this
nickel-and-dime shit we've been doing

30:40.572 --> 30:42.210
I'm trying to get
this paper for real, man

30:42.273 --> 30:44.685
This right here could be
our meal ticket outta the hood

30:44.742 --> 30:46.551
So what you want to do?

30:49.147 --> 30:50.820
You should be a actor, man

30:50.882 --> 30:53.795
'Cause I felt that. I felt like
the movie-- on "Menace ll Society

30:53.852 --> 30:56.264
when he said "You gonna let
that nigga kill your cousin?

30:56.321 --> 30:58.267
Let that shit ride?
Fuck that!"

30:58.323 --> 31:00.599
That's how I-- whoa, shit.
What the-- you hear that shit?

31:00.658 --> 31:02.160
Man, whatever, man
Come on, man.

31:02.227 --> 31:04.798
No, but I'm for real though
I feel what you're saying.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.207
- Real good talk.
- Pfft, that's bullshit, man

31:14.772 --> 31:16.809
Man, what if we do come up?

31:16.875 --> 31:18.980
What you gonna do
with all the brick?

31:19.043 --> 31:21.421
Shit, first thing I'm a do, man,

31:21.479 --> 31:24.551
I'm a get me a motherfucking
'58 Chevy Impala, nigga.

31:24.616 --> 31:27.825
Put some bang in that bitch
throw some "D"s on that ho

31:27.886 --> 31:30.628
You know, get it ready for the summer
You know what I'm saying?

31:30.688 --> 31:32.292
- I feel you, nigga
- Yeah yeah.

31:32.357 --> 31:34.394
Shit, after that though
I'll have to get me a spot

31:34.459 --> 31:36.530
You know,
somewhere outside of the hood

31:36.594 --> 31:40.167
where I don't have to worry about
catching a stray bullet in my sleep

31:40.231 --> 31:42.507
Nigga, I definitely feel you
on that shit, nigga.

31:42.567 --> 31:45.070
- Shit.
- What about you, man?

31:45.136 --> 31:46.547
- What you gonna do?

31:46.604 --> 31:49.380
I might take Shante
on a trip to Jamaica

31:50.975 --> 31:53.751
Probably sit on the beach
or some shit, chill out.

31:53.811 --> 31:56.382
- With a fat blunt of course
- Mm-hmm.

31:56.447 --> 31:59.917
Me sittin' there smoking a good one
and have her run into the water,

31:59.984 --> 32:02.828
with a nice pretty thong

32:02.887 --> 32:06.164
where I don't see nothing
but her ass just jiggling.

32:07.558 --> 32:09.060
And then, shit

32:09.127 --> 32:10.936
I gotta buy something
for the kids,

32:10.995 --> 32:13.771
so I'll probably take all them
motherfuckers out to the toy store

32:13.831 --> 32:17.040
and just let them ball till they fall
you know what I'm saying?

32:17.101 --> 32:20.344
But I'm definitely moving out
of the motherfucking hood.

32:20.405 --> 32:23.875
- Hell yeah.
- Shit, but I been thinking

32:23.942 --> 32:26.218
I don't really know
where the fuck to go

32:26.277 --> 32:28.018
- What do you mean?
- Shit, I mean

32:28.079 --> 32:30.559
I don't want to be around
no white folks and shit.

32:30.615 --> 32:33.721
You know what I'm saying?
I ain't trying to live by none of them

32:33.785 --> 32:35.560
Yeah, I know

32:35.620 --> 32:37.930
I wonder is there a spot
for people like us,

32:37.989 --> 32:40.265
like rich broke niggas.
You know what I'm saying?

32:40.325 --> 32:43.670
Niggas that made a little money
made their way up out the hood

32:43.728 --> 32:47.904
You know, I don't know.
There's gotta be somewhere

32:49.267 --> 32:51.543
Baa,

32:51.602 --> 32:53.775
I'm about to crash, man
It's been a long day.

32:53.838 --> 32:55.476
Holla at you

32:55.540 --> 32:57.747
All right, cool.
You got some lotion?

32:57.809 --> 33:00.255
No no,
I ain't got no lotion

33:00.311 --> 33:02.291
Give me that Off.
It'll work the same

33:02.347 --> 33:06.227
Off?
You meaning Jack-Off?

33:06.284 --> 33:09.697
- Don't judge me.
- Man, you a nasty motherfucker

33:12.123 --> 33:15.263
- Shoot that way.
- Don't be in my way

33:26.604 --> 33:28.550
- Uh-oh.
- What's up, man?

33:28.606 --> 33:30.677
I gotta boo-boo

33:30.742 --> 33:32.813
Can you hold it till the blunt?

33:32.877 --> 33:36.324
No, man, my-- my stomach
is beefin' with my asshole.

33:36.381 --> 33:38.554
And I think my stomach
winning this beef.

33:38.616 --> 33:41.563
- Hurry up, man.
- Hold this for me, man

33:41.619 --> 33:42.927
I gotta go boo-boo

33:59.070 --> 34:01.880
Damn, when did I eat almonds?

34:03.041 --> 34:04.384
Uh-oh, that ain't it

34:05.576 --> 34:06.953
Shit

34:09.981 --> 34:11.790
Can't use that shit.

34:11.849 --> 34:14.226
Don't know what you gonna
wipe your ass with.

34:21.391 --> 34:23.429
Whoo!

34:23.494 --> 34:26.100
'Bout time, man. Shit, I was
about to leave without you.

34:26.164 --> 34:29.577
Hey, boy, don't go in that
west wing of the forest.

34:44.681 --> 34:46.855
Say, man, you smell something?

34:46.918 --> 34:48.522
Hey, man, stop playing with me

34:48.585 --> 34:50.496
I wiped my ass good
with that furry rabbit.

34:50.554 --> 34:53.399

34:53.458 --> 34:55.130

Man, that's weed.

37:34.118 --> 37:36.564
Man, I ain't saying nothing

37:36.621 --> 37:40.034
Ain't no Minister Farrakhan

37:41.726 --> 37:45.640
Now my daddy's the judge
in the only courthouse for 200 miles,

37:45.696 --> 37:48.836
so I suggest you
show me some respect!

37:48.899 --> 37:51.743
Man, I ain't saying nothing
until I talk to my lawyer.

37:51.802 --> 37:54.305
Damn!
I hate that

37:56.274 --> 37:57.844
Now you lookie here, Earl

37:57.908 --> 38:00.889
You're looking
at a whole mess of jail time

38:00.945 --> 38:05.951
And let me tell you,
those big hairy redneck convicts

38:06.017 --> 38:09.726
sure ain't gonna go light
on your little black butthole

38:09.787 --> 38:12.495
Unless of course
they take a shine to you

38:12.556 --> 38:14.729
and they tell you that
you have a purty mouth

38:32.276 --> 38:34.222
We call it "Deliverance 2

38:34.278 --> 38:36.849
- The Dark Side
- No no no.

38:38.082 --> 38:40.562
So tell me who you're with

38:40.618 --> 38:43.497
The Gatsfields or the McRoys?

38:44.588 --> 38:46.363
WEE

38:46.424 --> 38:48.404
Don't play dumb with me, stupid

38:49.627 --> 38:51.868
I'm telling you,
we have been watching

38:51.929 --> 38:55.172
the McCoys and Gatsfields
for more than two years now

38:55.232 --> 38:58.873
Neither one of these clowns
would have anything to do with them

38:58.936 --> 39:01.883
Well, then who the hell are they?

39:01.939 --> 39:04.442
Don't know.
Mutt and Jeff

39:04.508 --> 39:06.579
Frick and Frack,
Fucking Kid 'n Play

39:06.644 --> 39:08.555
Who gives a shit?
Let 'em go.

39:11.015 --> 39:14.986
Come on, Earl. Suck it up.
Tell me whose pot farm it is

39:16.487 --> 39:18.626
Yeah yeah!

39:18.689 --> 39:20.464
Hey hey hey,
you're free to go now

39:20.524 --> 39:21.594
- Come on.
- What what?

39:21.659 --> 39:23.639
Let him go!
You got the wrong guy

39:23.694 --> 39:25.799
No no no, but he just confessed

39:25.863 --> 39:27.843
Yeah, you scared him
half to damn death, man

39:27.898 --> 39:29.878
- Hey, my man, get outta here. Go go!
- Huh?

39:29.934 --> 39:31.845
Stop slobbering
and get your ass up outta here

39:31.902 --> 39:33.973
-Me?
-Bye-bye.

39:34.038 --> 39:35.984
You sure?

39:38.542 --> 39:40.522
I can go.
Okay, I can go

39:45.082 --> 39:46.356
- Pussy!
- Hey!

39:46.417 --> 39:48.658
What are you doing, man?
Let me tell you something:

39:48.719 --> 39:50.255
you are wasting our time, all right?

39:50.321 --> 39:52.096
And you're bringing
too much attention to this investigation

39:52.156 --> 39:53.829
with your hillbilly style of cop work

39:53.891 --> 39:55.666
Lemme-- lemme tell
you something, my man,

39:55.726 --> 39:57.706
this is how this is
gonna go down, okay?

39:57.762 --> 39:59.742
You gonna leave
the drug bust to us,

39:59.797 --> 40:03.335
while you stick
to writing traffic tickets

40:03.401 --> 40:06.007
and breaking up domestic
disputes, you understand?

40:06.070 --> 40:08.311
- That's a pretty good accent
- Thank you.

40:08.372 --> 40:10.648
Yam

40:10.708 --> 40:12.813
- Yes.
- Good

40:20.985 --> 40:22.328
Feds

40:25.089 --> 40:26.591
Look at Tony!
There's Tony.

40:26.657 --> 40:27.692
Hell no

40:27.758 --> 40:29.533
Told y'all we was innocent!

40:29.593 --> 40:31.300
- Yeah, nigga.
- God damn it

40:31.362 --> 40:33.899
It's just like the white male
trying to keep a brother down

40:33.964 --> 40:35.671
Oh yeah, and I forgot to tell y'all

40:35.733 --> 40:37.610
Minister Farrakhan said what's up

40:37.668 --> 40:39.614
Alaikum assalam

40:42.940 --> 40:44.715
Sign there

40:44.775 --> 40:47.984
- Where my EBT card at?
- Hey, wait a minute.

40:48.045 --> 40:50.548
- Where are my keys, man?
- You mean these?

40:50.614 --> 40:53.993
Damn, did I forget to tell you?
No, you ain't getting 'em back.

40:54.051 --> 40:56.793
What the fuck you mean
you ain't give me my keys, man?

40:56.854 --> 40:59.698
Apparently you got expired tags
so we had to impound it.

40:59.757 --> 41:01.703
- My car?!
- That's my car

41:01.759 --> 41:04.069
- Oh.
- Now you boys are resourceful

41:04.128 --> 41:07.701
I'm sure you'll have a long refreshing
walk all the way back to Compton.

41:10.534 --> 41:13.447
Unless of course you want to stay.
We're gonna do some shooting later

41:13.504 --> 41:15.313
No, we're good, we're good
Let's go, let's go.

41:15.372 --> 41:17.875
Just gonna shoot
some cans is all. Jamai-cans,

41:17.942 --> 41:20.786
Mexi-cans, Puerto Ri-cans

41:20.845 --> 41:22.825
Afri-cans.

41:22.880 --> 41:25.793
- Now what the hell we supposed to do?
- Shit, I don't know, man.

41:25.850 --> 41:27.557
Shit, who the fuck can we call?

41:27.618 --> 41:31.156
Now with no car, no money
and no way to get home,

41:31.222 --> 41:33.429
I had them just where
I wanted them.

41:33.491 --> 41:36.802
It was time to put
my plan in motion

41:36.861 --> 41:39.068
Shit, I don't know

41:39.129 --> 41:41.075
Hold up!

41:41.131 --> 41:42.542
Sanchez

41:45.970 --> 41:47.643
Fellas, back so soon?

41:47.705 --> 41:50.015
Yeah, man, we're in
a real fucking bind now, man

41:50.074 --> 41:52.315
They done fuck around
and pop me for my shit

41:52.376 --> 41:55.220
- and they took his car.
- We barely got any money left, man,

41:55.279 --> 41:57.555
- and no way home now.
- Man, what the fuck we gonna do?

41:57.615 --> 42:00.323
I've already made preparations
for you guys to crash at my crib

42:00.384 --> 42:02.330
- I knew you'd be back
- Your crib?

42:02.386 --> 42:05.629
We ain't about to stay in your crib!
You see how this shit look?

42:05.689 --> 42:07.532
You got Christmas tree lights
around this bitch.

42:07.591 --> 42:08.797
I know your house look even worse

42:08.859 --> 42:11.533
Baum

42:19.637 --> 42:22.277
Sanchez,

42:22.339 --> 42:25.786

hillbilly fabulous around this bitch

42:25.843 --> 42:29.052
Hell yeah. Why you didn't tell us
you had shit like this?

42:29.113 --> 42:32.890
Oh, you thought when I said
I was stuck here, it was all bad

42:32.950 --> 42:37.126
Hell no. Come on,
I want to show you something

42:37.187 --> 42:39.758
Right over here

42:42.192 --> 42:43.967
You living lovely, Sanchez.

42:44.028 --> 42:45.939
Hey, why don't you
tell us what it is, shorty?

42:45.996 --> 42:49.205
Yeah, put me on some of this thing
you got going on around here.

42:49.266 --> 42:50.768
- Yeah.
- Fuck with me

42:50.834 --> 42:52.871
I don't know about that,
but check this out.

42:56.340 --> 42:59.287
- Shat.
- Oh my God

42:59.343 --> 43:01.949
Oh shit

43:02.012 --> 43:05.050
Hush, mamacita
Oh shit, oh shit.

43:05.115 --> 43:06.355
Can-- can I go-- in?

43:06.417 --> 43:08.920
Yeah, go right ahead
and grab a bud to smoke

43:08.986 --> 43:10.966
Oh Lord Jesus

43:12.890 --> 43:16.463
You see, this is what I do

43:16.527 --> 43:18.234
What, smoke weed?

43:19.663 --> 43:23.338
No, I cultivate it

43:23.400 --> 43:25.971
I know what climate it likes

43:26.036 --> 43:28.573
what's the best
source of nourishment?

43:28.639 --> 43:31.381
I know how it grows
I know how it thinks.

43:31.442 --> 43:35.618
I know how it feels.
I am one with the sativa plant

43:37.715 --> 43:41.162
And most importantly I know
when it's time to harvest.

43:41.218 --> 43:44.392
Right, well, I'm trying to
harvest this weed into a blunt

43:44.455 --> 43:46.731
Or a zigzag or something

43:46.790 --> 43:48.997
Right over there in the box

43:49.059 --> 43:51.232
Appreciate it, folk

43:51.295 --> 43:55.072
So that's what I do. I teach
these hillbillies how to grow weed

43:55.132 --> 43:56.805
and they pay me well for it

43:56.867 --> 43:58.676
Why don't you just start
your own crop?

43:58.736 --> 44:00.238
Oh, no way

44:00.304 --> 44:03.979
This mountain is
basically controlled by two families

44:04.041 --> 44:07.887
Two families
of inbred, backwood

44:07.945 --> 44:09.822
animalistic hillbillies

44:14.118 --> 44:17.429
the Gatsfields...

44:19.189 --> 44:20.725
and the McRoys

44:22.593 --> 44:24.595
My crop came up
a few pounds short again!

44:24.662 --> 44:27.302
I know your sons had
something to do with it!

44:27.364 --> 44:31.176
I got my own crop!
I ain't had nothing to do with that

44:40.878 --> 44:43.358
- Shit.
- These two families have been feuding

44:43.414 --> 44:45.894
for years-- decades

44:45.949 --> 44:48.930
First it was moonshine
and now it's chronic.

44:48.986 --> 44:52.058
You got me fucked up. I ain't
going up there with them crackers

44:54.525 --> 44:57.472
See, I told you from the get-go we
should have just started rapping, man

44:57.528 --> 44:59.371
Man, what the fuck
you talking about, man?

44:59.430 --> 45:01.967
It was your whole stupid-ass
idea in the first place, man.

45:02.032 --> 45:05.536
Until I seen all that camping shit.
I knew this was some fucked shit then

45:05.602 --> 45:07.582
It's too late now,
Captain Dipshit.

45:07.638 --> 45:10.551
All right, come on, pendejos,
stop it, all right? Listen,

45:10.607 --> 45:13.816
I got a foolproof plan
to pull it off.

45:13.877 --> 45:16.551
That mean you gonna roll
with us then, right?

45:16.613 --> 45:20.288
- No, I can't
- Why not?

45:20.350 --> 45:22.023
I've been banished from up there

45:22.086 --> 45:24.088
Why is that?

45:24.154 --> 45:26.498
It's a long story,
but I tell you what

45:26.557 --> 45:28.969
I'm gonna send you up there
to meet somebody that I know

45:29.026 --> 45:32.769
Her name is Marie.
She's Jim Gatsfield's only daughter

45:32.830 --> 45:35.777
She works at the only bar up there--

45:35.833 --> 45:37.608
The Last Call

45:44.808 --> 45:47.254
Oh yeah

45:52.116 --> 45:53.823
Hey, what's happening?
How you doing?

45:53.884 --> 45:55.864
- I'm fine.
- Yes, you are

45:55.919 --> 45:58.729
I'm Little Earl.
This is my player partner

45:58.789 --> 46:01.269
- Ray Ray.
- I'm Marie.

46:01.325 --> 46:03.327
Can I get y'all
something to drink?

46:03.393 --> 46:07.341
Yeah, can we get two cognacs
and a chaser on the side?

46:07.397 --> 46:10.378
- Hold the chaser.
- Coming right up

46:10.434 --> 46:13.881
- She's fine.

46:13.937 --> 46:17.316
Well, Sanchez sent us

46:17.374 --> 46:20.514

46:20.577 --> 46:23.114
What would he send you
up here for?

46:23.180 --> 46:25.251
To get some of them trees.

46:25.315 --> 46:27.955
- The what?

46:32.890 --> 46:35.370
How about some drinks, sweetass?

46:36.960 --> 46:38.371
The hell you boys doing in here?

46:38.428 --> 46:40.931
You know you ain't welcome
in Gatsfield's bar.

46:40.998 --> 46:44.104
Me and my brother was sitting up
on the hill drinking whiskey,

46:44.168 --> 46:47.741
when we decided tonight was the night we
was gonna get a piece of that sweet ass.

46:47.805 --> 46:51.582
The only thing y'all gonna get
is a hole in your head.

46:53.811 --> 46:56.189
I get it.
You're only into dark meat

46:57.514 --> 46:59.323
Oh, I got your stuffin', baby

46:59.383 --> 47:01.192
What about you stuff
some Febreze in your mouth?

47:01.251 --> 47:03.492
You talk pretty bold for a nigger

47:03.554 --> 47:06.160
Did you just call me a nigger?
What the-- whoa, shit, he's strong

47:06.223 --> 47:08.396
But not you

47:08.458 --> 47:10.904

47:10.961 --> 47:13.737

47:13.797 --> 47:16.710

47:16.767 --> 47:18.576
FuckboY!

47:22.739 --> 47:24.878
Y'all all right?

47:27.144 --> 47:31.058
I want to thank y'all for saving me

47:33.517 --> 47:36.157
Here you go

47:38.488 --> 47:41.799
What the fuck

47:45.195 --> 47:47.232
Where'd y'all get
them guns from-- T.l.?

47:47.297 --> 47:50.039
Are you motherfuckers

47:50.100 --> 47:53.104
trying to put your
ginormous-sized penises

47:53.170 --> 47:55.081
into our sweet Marie?

47:55.138 --> 47:57.778
- She's a virgin, you know
- No, she ain't.

47:57.841 --> 48:00.082
How do you know?

48:00.143 --> 48:02.521
It was the crop
Just so sweet.

48:02.579 --> 48:04.889
You fucking maggots were
trying to touch my sister

48:04.948 --> 48:06.894
in places that family's
only supposed to?

48:06.950 --> 48:09.430
- What?
- I say we take these two pieces of shit

48:09.486 --> 48:12.467
- outside right now!
- Yeah, and then dump their sorry asses

48:12.522 --> 48:14.468
down there by the river

48:14.524 --> 48:17.004
- Sounds like a plan.
- No, y'all, they helped me

48:17.060 --> 48:19.438
The McRoy boys was here.
That's why I flipped the alarm

48:19.496 --> 48:21.999
And these two
ran 'em up on outta here

48:22.065 --> 48:24.978
Are you shitting me?
These two?

48:25.035 --> 48:26.708
- Yeah.

48:26.770 --> 48:28.943
Beat the crap outta them,
had them running outta here

48:29.006 --> 48:30.644
- like a couple of sissies
- "G" shit.

48:30.707 --> 48:33.551
Well, dip my balls
in sweet cream and squat me

48:33.610 --> 48:35.954
- in a kitchen full of kittens
- You're such a poet.

48:36.013 --> 48:38.857
Anybody that fucks
with them McRoys

48:38.916 --> 48:41.419
- are friends of ours
- Absolutely!

48:41.485 --> 48:44.466
- You boys come over for dinner tonight
- Aw, but, Paw,

48:44.521 --> 48:47.627
I wanted to kill them.
I never get to kill nobody

48:47.691 --> 48:49.796
In time, son. In due time

48:58.902 --> 49:00.245
This barbecue's banging, man

49:00.304 --> 49:01.840
- What kind of meat is this?
- Raccoon.

49:03.473 --> 49:05.612
Told ya

49:05.676 --> 49:07.519
Told ya not to eat it.

49:07.577 --> 49:11.616
Say, Earl, why don't you give us
a song from back home?

49:11.682 --> 49:14.629
No, I couldn't play like that

49:14.685 --> 49:16.926
- Y'all ain't ready for me.
- Hey! My old lady wants you

49:16.987 --> 49:20.901
to sing a song, sing a song.
And it better not be Hank Williams

49:20.958 --> 49:24.337
Some songs are
sacrimonius around here

49:25.762 --> 49:28.675
- Spell sacrimonius
- N-l-G-G--

49:28.732 --> 49:30.803
All right, all right, all right

49:30.867 --> 49:32.073
All right

49:33.904 --> 49:36.783
Yeah, pluck them
goddamn strings on that guitar

49:36.840 --> 49:38.979
Let me show you how to get down

49:41.445 --> 49:43.254
Oh, I got one right here
Turn me up.

49:46.350 --> 49:49.797
I stay smoking kush,
she look like Reggie Bush

49:49.853 --> 49:51.389
Y'all look
like some slackers

49:51.455 --> 49:53.401
Oops, I meant some crackers--

49:53.457 --> 49:56.666
Crackers?! You want some crackers,
go up in the house.

49:56.727 --> 49:59.264
- They're in the pantry.
- Behind the moonshine

49:59.329 --> 50:01.969
Shit, that ain't nothing.
I can do better than that

50:02.032 --> 50:05.172
J.R., pluck them strings
you always pluck for me

50:05.235 --> 50:07.442
June Bug, bust a beat

50:07.504 --> 50:10.542
Yo, I chose this life,
this life chose me

50:12.175 --> 50:14.815
I didn't choose this life,
this life chose me

50:14.878 --> 50:17.688
I'm a hick from the sticks,
bitch, don't sneak

50:17.748 --> 50:19.921
I puff a lot of pot,
I drink a lot of booze

50:19.983 --> 50:22.429
Rhyme against me,
I guarantee you'll lose

50:22.486 --> 50:24.727
Don't get me pissed,
tryin' to dis my folks

50:24.788 --> 50:28.201
Next time you try and rap,
wrap you lips around this and choke

50:31.862 --> 50:33.899
That's my son!
Came from my nut

50:33.964 --> 50:36.205
I can tell

50:39.936 --> 50:42.746
So what is it like growing up
here in these mountains?

50:42.806 --> 50:45.218
Well

50:45.275 --> 50:47.118
it's all right, I guess

50:47.177 --> 50:50.215
I much rather would've grown up
somewhere like Atlanta.

50:50.280 --> 50:52.260
- Hmm, yeah
- Yeah.

50:52.315 --> 50:54.226
Tell me what it's like there

50:54.284 --> 50:57.390
I always wanted to know what
it's like to grow up in the city.

50:57.454 --> 51:00.162
I mean,
I grew up there all my life

51:00.223 --> 51:03.636
It's cool I guess,
but it's funny though

51:03.693 --> 51:07.698
When I came out here, I was
just dying to get away from the hood

51:07.764 --> 51:09.801
- From what?
- The hood.

51:09.866 --> 51:11.812
- The city.
- Oh, sorry

51:14.037 --> 51:16.916
No, but like I was saying,
I was just dying to get away

51:16.973 --> 51:18.884
But now that we're here,

51:18.942 --> 51:22.048
I kinda miss it, you know what
I'm saying? Just the little things

51:22.112 --> 51:24.752
The liquor stores, the people,

51:24.815 --> 51:27.591
- the food.
- You didn't like raccoon?

51:27.651 --> 51:29.790
No.
Huh-uh

51:31.755 --> 51:33.325
So

51:33.390 --> 51:35.427
what brought y'all
around these parts?

51:35.492 --> 51:37.768
Sanchez sent us over here
to get some crops.

51:37.828 --> 51:39.671
- We gonna--
- Oh, shh!

51:41.698 --> 51:43.644
You trying to get yourself killed?

51:49.406 --> 51:52.353
Say, Earl,
you want to smoke some?

51:52.409 --> 51:55.219
Did LeBron mama get fucked?

51:57.247 --> 51:58.692
Try that shit out

51:58.748 --> 52:00.989
You ain't said nothing
but a word, man.

52:02.519 --> 52:04.465
He's gonna fucking do it

52:07.090 --> 52:09.092
The fuck you sniggling for?!

52:09.159 --> 52:11.332
That's fucking
crystal meth, dude

52:11.394 --> 52:13.340
You retard !

52:33.049 --> 52:36.496
So y'all are here
to snatch some crop?

52:36.553 --> 52:39.033
Yeah, Sanchez sent us
up here to holla at you about

52:39.089 --> 52:41.626
snatching up some crops,
so we try and come up.

52:41.691 --> 52:44.171
You know that'll get you
killed around these parts?

52:44.227 --> 52:47.231
Pfft, killed?
Niggas face death every day

52:47.297 --> 52:49.607
living in the hood

52:49.666 --> 52:51.771
Well, you're a brave man

52:51.835 --> 52:53.906
I'm just trying to make a credit

52:53.970 --> 52:56.974
Make what?

52:57.040 --> 52:59.680
Never mind.
So what's up with the crops?

52:59.743 --> 53:02.781
Mmm, you sure that's all
you wanna talk about?

53:02.846 --> 53:05.326
Business first, you know

53:05.382 --> 53:07.794
- Maybe a little pleasure later
- Mmm.

53:07.851 --> 53:09.853
Well, how about a little of both?

53:09.920 --> 53:12.992
- Mmm, well...
- Marie!

53:13.056 --> 53:15.662
- Yeah?
- Time to come in

53:15.725 --> 53:18.365
Look, you want
to finish this later?

53:18.428 --> 53:20.601
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm
- Yeah, later.

53:22.132 --> 53:23.440
Marie!

53:23.500 --> 53:26.003
Here I come

53:27.204 --> 53:29.047
I'll holla at you in a little bit

53:30.307 --> 53:32.253
Where do I... sleep

53:32.309 --> 53:34.220
Mann

53:40.016 --> 53:42.519
Don't put that thumb in my ass

54:01.171 --> 54:02.912
Where are they going?

54:02.973 --> 54:05.249
Oh, they're all going on
to work on the crops.

54:06.443 --> 54:07.922
- Earl.
- It's a curable disease

54:07.978 --> 54:10.185
- Oh, come on, Earl, get up.
- It's a curable disease, baby

54:10.247 --> 54:11.487
Get up!
They're going to get the crops

54:11.548 --> 54:12.959
- Who?
- Let's go, man. Come on

54:13.016 --> 54:15.257
Don't forget your lunch

54:15.318 --> 54:18.299
Oh, you flirt.
You old flirt!

54:18.355 --> 54:21.097
There you go

54:21.157 --> 54:23.660
- Scoot!
- Don't look at my booty

54:23.727 --> 54:25.468
How can I help it?

54:30.867 --> 54:33.939
- We got a big day ahead of us, bro
- It's just weed, man.

54:34.004 --> 54:35.483
Yeah

54:39.843 --> 54:41.516
Yeah, let's go

54:41.578 --> 54:43.251
- Let's roll, buddy
- You're strong.

54:43.313 --> 54:45.520
- Aw, no, shit.
- What's up, baby? You good?

54:45.582 --> 54:48.188
Everybody that voted
for Barack Obama?

54:48.251 --> 54:50.094
Get outta my truck.
That means you two

54:50.153 --> 54:51.962
- We got work to do
- I can't vote.

54:52.022 --> 54:54.502
We don't mind working, though
We can work all day.

54:54.557 --> 54:57.834
- I like to earn my keep
- Paw said you can't go

54:57.894 --> 55:00.340
So I suggest you two get
the fuck outta this truck

55:00.397 --> 55:02.877
before I skin one of you
city motherfuckers.

55:02.932 --> 55:04.969
- I do not need a haircut
- All right, damn, man.

55:05.035 --> 55:06.105
All right, all right

55:06.169 --> 55:07.671
I know when we're not wanted

55:07.737 --> 55:09.341
- Let's roll.
- Yeah, I can tell when we ain't wanted

55:09.406 --> 55:12.148
It's a damn shame. Okay

55:12.208 --> 55:13.687
Yeehaw

55:22.218 --> 55:24.596
- Fucking bite me!
- Oh, Lord!

55:24.654 --> 55:26.827
Why he do that?

55:26.890 --> 55:29.632
His daddy must be
running up in here.

55:31.261 --> 55:33.070
Man, this really sucks

55:33.129 --> 55:36.042
We ain't got no weed,
we ain't got no money

55:36.099 --> 55:38.375
And on top of that,
I had to see this white man's ass

55:38.435 --> 55:40.073
that look like
an empty eye socket

55:40.136 --> 55:42.548
I'm gone.
Man, I'm tired of this

55:42.605 --> 55:45.211
- Where-- where you going?
- I gotta go boo-boo.

55:51.014 --> 55:53.460
Now what the fuck are we gonna do?

55:56.152 --> 55:57.426
Hey, come on

Hi there, sexy

56:15.638 --> 56:18.448
Tell me, what would you do

56:18.508 --> 56:20.579

56:22.512 --> 56:24.253
- Hmm?
- Unfortunately anything

56:24.314 --> 56:27.022
Oh, that's kinda what I thought

56:27.083 --> 56:30.826
Won't you follow Ma?
Come on now.

56:30.887 --> 56:33.629
Don't be shy
Come on.

Oooh!

56:38.661 --> 56:40.766

- You'll see.

56:42.565 --> 56:44.738
Mam

56:44.801 --> 56:47.281

56:47.337 --> 56:51.479
You're just a little

56:51.541 --> 56:54.647

- Yes, now. Can I do it right now?

56:54.711 --> 56:56.349
- Huh-uh-uh.

56:56.413 --> 56:58.757
No no no.
No love, no bud

56:58.815 --> 57:00.817
Can we get this over with?

57:00.884 --> 57:04.627
That's just what Paw said

57:04.687 --> 57:08.567
Come on now.
Slip them panties off

57:08.625 --> 57:10.901
I'm so stupid!

57:10.960 --> 57:12.997
These are not panties neither

57:13.062 --> 57:14.735
- Oh really?
- These are briefs!

57:14.798 --> 57:17.438
Oh my goodness,

57:17.500 --> 57:20.538
Oh my! Look, I was right
You are packing.

57:20.603 --> 57:23.607
I'm gonna have to take
my teeth out for this.

57:23.673 --> 57:25.778
Teeth?

57:28.178 --> 57:29.748
Ahh-- Oh

57:29.813 --> 57:31.486
Oh-- oh my God

57:31.548 --> 57:32.993
Oh-

This weed--

57:35.251 --> 57:37.197
this weed right here

57:37.253 --> 57:40.257
- Your pops grow this shit right here?
- Mm-hmm.

57:40.323 --> 57:43.031
Yeah, I got it out
of a secret stash.

57:43.092 --> 57:46.369
Secret stash?
All the weed they growing up there,

57:46.429 --> 57:48.409
why they don't just give you some?

57:48.465 --> 57:51.344
Give"?

57:51.401 --> 57:55.213
No, sugar.
They don't give me anything

57:55.271 --> 57:57.877
Shit.
Thank you

57:57.941 --> 58:00.649
The only time they
pay attention to me

58:00.710 --> 58:03.247
is when the McRoy boys
are bothering me

58:03.313 --> 58:05.759
or if they want me to sleep
in the bed with them

58:05.815 --> 58:07.886
so they can grope
all over me and shit

58:07.951 --> 58:10.932
- Your father too?
- My father, my mother, my brothers,

58:10.987 --> 58:13.194
the uncles, cousins--
all of them, shit.

58:13.256 --> 58:15.327
- That's how family does
- That's fucked up.

58:15.391 --> 58:16.961
- Pilot?
- Yes.

58:17.026 --> 58:19.768
All right, we want to make sure
we fly nice and low. Make sure we get

58:19.829 --> 58:21.968
- the faces of these bastards
- Roger.

58:34.744 --> 58:37.054
Looks pretty good

58:37.113 --> 58:40.287
Think I'll leave it
out here another week or so

58:50.260 --> 58:52.035
All right,
get ready, get ready

59:00.436 --> 59:02.347
You see that sumbitch
taking pictures?

59:02.405 --> 59:04.043
Who was it?

59:04.107 --> 59:05.552
I don't know

59:05.608 --> 59:08.646
So we gotta harvest this
sooner than I thought.

59:16.586 --> 59:19.157
Now you know you was wrong
for having me in that boat today

59:19.222 --> 59:21.133
- Ah, you all right.
- You know black folks

59:21.190 --> 59:22.498
and water don't get along too good

59:22.559 --> 59:24.402
What if I could've drown?

59:24.460 --> 59:26.997
Oh, I guess I would have had
to give you mouth-to-mouth.

59:27.063 --> 59:28.770
Oh shit,
you can do that anyway

59:31.000 --> 59:34.413
Maybe we should hurry up and get back
before my dad and them get home.

59:34.470 --> 59:36.780
- Shit, let's do it
- All right.

59:44.814 --> 59:47.624
- Oh yeah yeah
- Mmm...

59:52.121 --> 59:54.829
What? What's up, fellas?
Hey, what's happening?

59:54.891 --> 59:57.667
You took a wrong fucking
turn somewhere, buddy.

59:57.727 --> 01:00:00.401
Uh well, we just took
a cruise in a boat.

01:00:00.463 --> 01:00:02.704
And we was headed
back up the hill

01:00:02.765 --> 01:00:04.711
and we about

01:00:04.767 --> 01:00:07.577

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:14.044
Strip

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:18.850
Hey, pump your brakes there,
Girls Gone Wild.

01:00:18.915 --> 01:00:20.622
Just him

01:00:20.683 --> 01:00:23.493
- Oh no no no, hell no
- Strip!

01:00:23.553 --> 01:00:26.363
Man, okay, wait a minute, man
Damn, hold up, hold up.

01:00:28.324 --> 01:00:29.860
I can't believe this shit, man

01:00:29.926 --> 01:00:31.963
What y'all gonna do, man?

01:00:32.028 --> 01:00:33.769
We're gonna fuck you

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:36.106
and make your little
girlfriend here watch

01:00:36.165 --> 01:00:39.476
Yeah, I'll make you squeal like a pig!

01:00:39.535 --> 01:00:41.811
Oh no, wait a minute, man
Hold up. One thing.

01:00:41.871 --> 01:00:44.181
One thing before you do that, man,
let me just do one thing.

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:47.119
Let me hit this one time
and you can do whatever, man

01:00:47.176 --> 01:00:49.486
Just one time.
Just let me hit this

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:36.666
They ain't shit.
Alls I need is some weed

01:01:36.726 --> 01:01:40.697
I'll show them motherfuckers
my "Blunted Master" technique

01:01:42.331 --> 01:01:44.277
I 9011 you

01:01:44.333 --> 01:01:48.179
Fuck me?
No, fuck y'all

01:01:52.475 --> 01:01:55.319
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

01:01:57.213 --> 01:01:59.215
Hey, where the hell you been?!

01:01:59.282 --> 01:02:00.852
Come on, man
Chill out, man.

01:02:00.917 --> 01:02:02.590
You're carrying
around picnic baskets

01:02:02.652 --> 01:02:04.359
Old sucker for lunch--

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:06.263

01:02:06.322 --> 01:02:08.893
Come on, man.

01:02:08.958 --> 01:02:11.438
- Man, what's happening?
- Man, whatever.

01:02:11.494 --> 01:02:13.804
Marie, where the hell

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:15.240
Shh.
Hey, chill out, man

01:02:15.298 --> 01:02:17.744
I got this under control.
You know what I'm saying?

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.245
We leaving tonight

01:02:19.302 --> 01:02:21.714
And Marie-
she going with us

01:02:21.771 --> 01:02:24.377
We ain't going nowhere
with this basic-ass hill rat.

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.750
- No?
- She look regular as hell in the city

01:02:26.809 --> 01:02:29.790
Well, I know where all

01:02:29.846 --> 01:02:31.621

01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:33.251

Fuck your face,
waffle-house, teeth-ass bitch!

01:02:35.051 --> 01:02:37.725
Fuck your damn face. Fuck your
goatee and your big eyebrows

01:02:37.787 --> 01:02:39.858
- and fuck your little-ass neck!
- Chill out, chill out.

01:02:39.922 --> 01:02:42.129
Look here, you gotta pick
either me or her. Make a choice

01:02:42.191 --> 01:02:44.262
Oh, Earl,

01:02:44.327 --> 01:02:46.432
I just wanted to thank you

01:02:46.496 --> 01:02:49.340
for all that plumbing work
you did for me

01:02:49.398 --> 01:02:51.002
this morning.

01:02:51.067 --> 01:02:53.377
You really cleaned out my pipes

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:55.575
I'll step in any booby trap
you want me to. Let's go.

01:02:55.638 --> 01:02:57.481
Let's go.
I'm ready to die

01:03:27.203 --> 01:03:28.409
Watch out

01:03:29.839 --> 01:03:33.309
- Who the fuck is this?
- They only guard it like this

01:03:33.376 --> 01:03:37.119
- when it's a close call
- Close call like what?

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:40.161
Pot snatchers or the police

01:03:41.384 --> 01:03:43.864
So they gonna shoot it out
with the fucking police?

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:47.163
No, they got flamethrower things

01:03:47.223 --> 01:03:48.759
at each corner of the crops

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:50.634
- That's some smart-ass hillbillies
- Mm-hmm.

01:03:50.693 --> 01:03:53.230
Man, I'm glad you're
so impressed with their criminality

01:03:53.296 --> 01:03:55.572
But now how the fuck
we supposed to get this weed?

01:03:55.631 --> 01:03:58.111
I guess we're gonna have to
come up with another plan.

01:04:00.703 --> 01:04:03.377
Oh shit, come on
Come on, nigga.

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:10.283
See, Ray and Earl
or even I didn't realize

01:04:10.346 --> 01:04:12.383
we had picked
the worst possible time

01:04:12.448 --> 01:04:14.052
to make a move

01:04:14.116 --> 01:04:17.359
The DEA agents were hot
on the Gatsfield's tail

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:20.196
and preparing to make a bust

01:04:20.256 --> 01:04:22.258
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

01:04:22.325 --> 01:04:24.396
- and Deputy Dick
- Dan.

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:27.600
Whatever. We are gonna send
our ground troops

01:04:27.663 --> 01:04:30.075
on the ground right here,
while simultaneously

01:04:30.132 --> 01:04:32.840
choppers will be landing
here on the field.

01:04:32.902 --> 01:04:34.973
- Okay?
- What day are we doing this?

01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:37.039
Tomorrow

01:04:37.106 --> 01:04:39.086
- Now--
- Tomorrow's bowling night

01:04:39.141 --> 01:04:41.621
- Can we do it Thursday?
- Deputy Dan?

01:04:41.677 --> 01:04:43.884
You're not stuck
on stupid, are you?

01:04:43.946 --> 01:04:47.086
You're dangling on dummy
Shut the hell up.

01:04:47.149 --> 01:04:49.561
Where the hell did you
find this guy?

01:04:49.619 --> 01:04:51.394
Are we clear?
Any questions?

01:04:51.454 --> 01:04:53.331
What's he mean by that?

01:04:54.857 --> 01:04:56.359
All right, look, y'all

01:04:56.425 --> 01:04:58.405
- we gonna come out right here
- Uh-huh.

01:04:58.461 --> 01:05:01.670
Start here and we gonna come out
somewhere about right here.

01:05:01.731 --> 01:05:05.042
And we gonna be off on the freeway
and then after that we home free.

01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:06.205
- Cool.
- Okay?

01:05:06.269 --> 01:05:07.646
- Yeah yeah
- Good.

01:05:07.703 --> 01:05:10.479
That shit sound good,
but so did your other plan

01:05:10.539 --> 01:05:12.985
that got fucked up.

01:05:13.042 --> 01:05:16.251
Look,baby,
this here is foolproof

01:05:16.312 --> 01:05:19.020
That's what your mouth say
I don't believe that shit.

01:05:19.081 --> 01:05:21.288
Well, this is right
this time, I promise

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:23.660
- I know it for a fact.
- Hell, all your shit always-

01:05:23.719 --> 01:05:25.596
Shut the hell up!

01:05:25.655 --> 01:05:28.636
Get your girl, man. I ain't buying that
fucking shit. You know how I get.

01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:30.398

- Man, you better get your girl

01:05:31.961 --> 01:05:33.099
before I Chris Brown her ass

01:05:33.162 --> 01:05:35.369
Chill out, man.
Let's concentrate on the weed

01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:38.810
Man, you concentrate on checking her,
man. I'm tired of all this shit.

01:05:38.868 --> 01:05:41.712
- She know what she doing.
- Fuck you and motherfuck you!

01:06:05.194 --> 01:06:08.004
You know what?
I thought about it, I'm a chill

01:06:08.064 --> 01:06:09.543
- That's cool
- I'm a chill.

01:06:09.598 --> 01:06:10.702
Cool. All right now

01:06:10.766 --> 01:06:12.803
I take my fuck back from you,
but still fuck you.

01:06:12.868 --> 01:06:14.711

01:06:14.770 --> 01:06:16.340

We're outta here.

01:06:18.474 --> 01:06:19.976
Shit, tomorrow morning
it is then.

01:06:20.042 --> 01:06:22.750
Yeah.
Uh-huh

01:06:22.812 --> 01:06:24.291
Mm-hmm.

01:06:24.347 --> 01:06:26.020
You a sucker-for-love nigga, man

01:07:32.314 --> 01:07:34.885
- What are you doing here, Marie?
- It's the McRoy boys.

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:36.987
They got my daddy

01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:39.761

What the hell are you doing?
Who's guarding the crops?

01:07:52.835 --> 01:07:56.009
Marie's guarding the crops. She said
the McRoys are back at the house.

01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:58.643

Center mass, Lil June,

01:08:06.849 --> 01:08:09.557
Hey, y'all come on

01:08:09.618 --> 01:08:12.326

01:08:12.388 --> 01:08:14.629
Ugh, God!

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:19.069
No, come on, y'all! Come on!

01:08:21.029 --> 01:08:22.202

Now listen, maybe we can come

01:09:02.904 --> 01:09:04.747
It's compromise,

And we ain't coming to no compromise
We taking all this shit.

We're gonna take all

I'm afraid I can't let you do that

01:09:12.046 --> 01:09:14.390

01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:15.724

- Go ahead, take that bitch

01:09:22.358 --> 01:09:25.032
- I don't want nothing to do with her
- No, that ain't going down.

01:09:25.094 --> 01:09:27.198
Oh yeah, she goes down a lot

01:09:27.263 --> 01:09:28.707

Yeah!
You're my dawg, dawg!

01:10:46.642 --> 01:10:49.816
Hey, if a tree is burning

01:10:49.878 --> 01:10:52.324
you know, in the forest,

01:10:52.381 --> 01:10:54.190

01:10:57.686 --> 01:10:59.563
I never thought about that

01:11:09.732 --> 01:11:12.303

01:11:12.368 --> 01:11:14.644

Yeah, we got the weed, but shit!

01:11:21.677 --> 01:11:23.384
We ain't got no way
to get home now.

01:11:23.445 --> 01:11:25.288
- How the fuck we gonna get home?
- Use your thumb.

01:11:25.347 --> 01:11:26.883
Or your mouth.
Maybe that's more like--

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:28.622
That ain't gonna
get us nowhere-- nowhere

01:11:28.684 --> 01:11:30.186

01:11:37.559 --> 01:11:39.038
Man, what's going on?

01:11:39.094 --> 01:11:40.767
Why you didn't tell us
this was your daughter?

01:11:40.829 --> 01:11:43.309
Yeah, that's how I got stuck here

01:11:43.365 --> 01:11:45.811
I couldn't leave here
without my baby.

01:11:45.868 --> 01:11:48.405
Yes! Told y'all I could

01:12:05.821 --> 01:12:07.266
Is it true?

01:12:07.323 --> 01:12:10.304

01:12:10.359 --> 01:12:13.670

To all of those who wanna be,

Even though they reach their
limit and took it too far

01:12:58.273 --> 01:13:01.277
This for those who are
really thinking they focused

01:13:01.343 --> 01:13:04.119
Never up the nose,
dipping cigarettes is bogus

01:13:04.179 --> 01:13:06.625
All we need, we roll it
inhale and hold it

01:13:06.682 --> 01:13:09.322
Exhale, 'cause hell,
all we need, we smoke it

01:13:10.719 --> 01:13:13.495
All you need is weed
and nothing else

01:13:13.555 --> 01:13:16.058
Sit back and roll one
and enjoy yourself

01:13:16.125 --> 01:13:18.799

01:13:18.861 --> 01:13:21.034

All you need is weed
and nothing else

01:13:24.299 --> 01:13:27.109
Sit back and roll one

01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:29.911
All them other narcotics

01:13:29.972 --> 01:13:31.918
Yeah yeah yeah

01:13:31.974 --> 01:13:34.352
I got an old school partner,
he smoke crack

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:37.050
He's fierce with the lyrics,
but he probably won't come back

01:13:37.112 --> 01:13:39.991
To the studio, because he
might be out creepin'

01:13:40.048 --> 01:13:42.619
In somebody's house, trying
to clean 'em out, thievin'

01:13:42.684 --> 01:13:45.460
I know another nigga,
he smoke fry

01:13:45.521 --> 01:13:47.523
He always cry,
but we don't know why

01:13:47.589 --> 01:13:50.763
We tried to give him advice,
but he wouldn't take it

01:13:50.826 --> 01:13:53.432
Saw him last Wednesday
walking down the street beggin

01:13:53.495 --> 01:13:56.533
My homeboy used to holla,
but he's out there snorting powder

01:13:56.598 --> 01:13:58.942
Hour after hour,
but he'd never take a shower

01:13:59.001 --> 01:14:01.709
And I guess it's cool
if you can handle your thing

01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:04.512
But it's kinda fucked up
if you dismantle your brain

01:14:04.573 --> 01:14:07.144
Like my nigga poking his
veins with tracks in his arm

01:14:07.209 --> 01:14:10.088
He ain't real cool,
but he's always calm

01:14:10.145 --> 01:14:12.591
He disappear real quick
and shoot up one D

01:14:12.648 --> 01:14:15.219
I tried to pass him the weed
the nigga asleep.

01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:20.365
