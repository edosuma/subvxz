WEBVTT

00:14.180 --> 00:15.473
[Mindy] I love these.

00:15.557 --> 00:16.391
[Emily] I guess.

00:16.474 --> 00:17.726
What kind of flowers say,

00:17.809 --> 00:20.395
"Hey! Welcome back to the office.
Sorry I betrayed you"?

00:20.478 --> 00:22.439
It's only been two weeks
since she had that baby.

00:22.522 --> 00:24.899
What kind of flowers say,
"Go back to bed, hon"?

00:24.983 --> 00:26.026
I know, right?

00:26.735 --> 00:29.738
But since the McDisaster,
I've had to work double time

00:29.821 --> 00:34.075
to prove to Madeline that I'm loyal
or I could end up fired at two places.

00:34.159 --> 00:36.036
Oh, my God, then where would I live?

00:37.412 --> 00:38.246
How's Alfie?

00:38.747 --> 00:41.624
I don't know.
He barely responds to my texts.

00:41.708 --> 00:45.045
I just want to jump on the train
to London and tell him how I feel.

00:45.128 --> 00:47.881
But I'm single-handedly
holding down the fort at Savoir.

00:47.964 --> 00:50.341
Well, Madeline is lucky to have you.

00:50.425 --> 00:51.593
Forget flowers.

00:51.676 --> 00:54.012
Just get her a little bouquet
of Emily Coopers.

00:54.095 --> 00:57.682
Except most of our French clients
are jumping ship to Sylvie's firm.

00:58.141 --> 01:00.643
Ugh! Madeline has no idea
how bad things are.

01:00.727 --> 01:03.146
-But she will soon.
-[chuckles]

01:03.229 --> 01:05.065
This is going to be the longest day.

01:05.148 --> 01:07.734
Actually, the day after tomorrow
is the longest day.

01:08.234 --> 01:09.235
It's solstice.

01:09.694 --> 01:12.113
Oh, well, thanks for the pagan
calendar update.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.323
It's a thing in Paris.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.200
The whole city celebrates.
It's my favorite.

01:15.283 --> 01:18.078
Called Fête de la Musique.
The band and I will play in the third.

01:18.161 --> 01:20.413
Mindy, you should be playing
at the jazz club,

01:20.497 --> 01:22.332
not busking on the streets of Paris.

01:22.415 --> 01:24.292
Does Benoît know you turned them down?

01:24.375 --> 01:26.503
No, no, I don't want to break up the band.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.963
And I didn't want to work
in two places at once.

01:29.047 --> 01:30.215
I saw how that went for you.

01:30.548 --> 01:33.093
Oh, glad I could be your cautionary tale.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.177
Honestly, same.

01:46.272 --> 01:47.774
<i>Bonjour!</i>

01:47.857 --> 01:49.067
She's back!

01:49.150 --> 01:52.153
Oh! Everybody's here now! It's a party!

01:53.404 --> 01:55.990
Emily, this is Josette, the <i>au pair.</i>

01:56.074 --> 01:57.867
<i>Enchantée,</i> Josette.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.369
[Madeline] And you know Jack.

01:59.452 --> 02:01.204
[Emily] Yes! Hello there, Jack!

02:01.287 --> 02:04.207
We met once in the hospital.
You were very popular.

02:04.290 --> 02:06.543
Because he's the biggest baby
they delivered in months!

02:06.626 --> 02:08.753
They kept calling him <i>le grand</i> baby.

02:08.837 --> 02:11.464
I thought that's why they kept me there
for three extra days.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.591
To do "perineal re-education."

02:14.467 --> 02:18.596
The more pressing matter
is that Chicago doesn't understand

02:18.680 --> 02:21.766
why Sylvie and the entire
French office walked out.

02:22.308 --> 02:24.477
I left out the part
where you followed them.

02:24.561 --> 02:27.438
I appreciate that.
And I hope you know that I'm here for you.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.649
I knew re-staffing would be a priority.

02:29.732 --> 02:32.110
So I called a couple
of French recruiting firms.

02:32.193 --> 02:35.697
<i>Chasseurs de tête,</i> as it were,
and I have a stack of resumes.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.117
Well, our only real concern
is replacing one person.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.118
Sylvie.

02:40.201 --> 02:42.495
That's all that matters to Chicago.
They're working on it.

02:45.582 --> 02:51.921
[in French] Rimowa, Pierre Cadault,
Maison Lavaux, Zimmer hotel, and you.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.381
Our calling card.

02:53.464 --> 02:54.716
It's so beautiful.

02:54.799 --> 02:57.552
So potential clients get a sense
of the talent they are surrounded by

02:57.635 --> 02:59.596
when they sign with Agence Grateau.

02:59.929 --> 03:05.268
Make sure Sandrine at Tiffany gets one
before our meeting this afternoon.

03:06.019 --> 03:11.733
We should post
a picture of the box to our social.

03:11.858 --> 03:13.943
One small problem. We don't have a social.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.154
Your dress for
Pierre's Museum retrospective.

03:16.237 --> 03:18.281
Direct from his atelier.

03:18.364 --> 03:19.449
My very own Cadault.

03:19.532 --> 03:22.202
They asked that you not
eat or drink anything while wearing it.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.913
And they'll need it back. Dry cleaned.

03:26.998 --> 03:30.752
We should also make sure Sandrine
gets an invitation to Pierre's show.

03:30.835 --> 03:33.588
It's important everyone knows
he's our client.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.396
[cell phone chimes]

04:20.510 --> 04:24.055
Let's go. I don't want to be late
for a meeting at Tiffany.

04:24.138 --> 04:27.600
Oh, uh, Sylvie set that meeting last month
before she left.

04:27.684 --> 04:31.062
Well, the meeting's with Savoir,
not Sylvie, so we're going.

04:31.145 --> 04:32.021
Come on!

04:32.647 --> 04:33.898
Oh. [groans]

04:43.533 --> 04:44.367
<i>Bonjour.</i>

04:44.909 --> 04:45.743
<i>Merci.</i>

04:52.292 --> 04:54.419
Check out those two business mavens.

04:54.502 --> 04:57.755
I hope they're not our competition.
They look pretty fierce.

04:57.839 --> 04:58.756
[both chuckle]

04:59.215 --> 05:00.216
[Emily clears throat]

05:01.718 --> 05:03.011
<i>Bonjour,</i> Sandrine.

05:03.094 --> 05:05.430
<i>Je suis</i> Madeline Wheeler from Savoir.

05:05.805 --> 05:06.848
<i>Bonjour.</i>

05:07.473 --> 05:10.393
I had a meeting
with Sylvie Grateau at this time.

05:10.476 --> 05:14.188
No, no. You're meeting was with Savoir.
Sylvie no longer works for us.

05:14.272 --> 05:16.941
I'm Madeline Wheeler.
And this is my associate--

05:17.025 --> 05:18.026
Emily?

05:18.318 --> 05:19.610
[in French] Oh, this isn't possible.

05:19.694 --> 05:20.945
[in English] No, not again.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.364
My apologies, Sandrine.

05:23.448 --> 05:26.617
This woman has the nasty habit
of showing up at my meetings.

05:26.701 --> 05:29.370
Your meeting is for Savoir.
We are Savoir.

05:29.454 --> 05:30.288
[in French] Not you.

05:30.371 --> 05:32.332
[Sylvie in English] That's the confusion.

05:32.415 --> 05:33.916
We are Agence Grateau now.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.001
It's my new company.

05:35.084 --> 05:38.087
I believe you've seen Sylvie's box.

05:40.715 --> 05:43.092
Rimowa, Pierre Cadault?

05:43.176 --> 05:44.969
Zimmer <i>et</i> Maison Lavaux.

05:45.094 --> 05:45.928
[chuckles]

05:46.012 --> 05:48.598
<i>Excusez-moi, madame,</i>
I'm not sure if you realize

05:48.681 --> 05:54.395
but when Gilbert Group acquired Savoir,
you all signed a strict non-compete.

05:56.147 --> 05:58.316
Okay, I'll let you two fight this out.

05:58.983 --> 05:59.901
Sandrine.

06:01.736 --> 06:02.945
Read your contract, Syl.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.323
Or better yet, have your lawyer do it.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.200
Come on, Emily.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.829
I can't believe you called her "Syl."

06:11.913 --> 06:13.623
Emily, get your head in the game.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.292
At the very least, Maison Lavaux
should be working with us.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.002
You had a relationship with Antoine.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.128
Not like Sylvie did.

06:19.212 --> 06:22.924
I should hope not, but we need
to make it very clear to Antoine.

06:23.007 --> 06:26.094
He cannot work with Sylvie
without legal repercussions.

06:26.594 --> 06:28.888
I have a long-standing
relationship with Sylvie.

06:28.971 --> 06:30.932
I'm a creature of habit,
what can I say?

06:31.015 --> 06:33.267
And I am a creature
of enforceable contracts.

06:33.351 --> 06:36.312
Sylvie may have left Savoir,
but she cannot take our accounts.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.814
What is she talking about?

06:37.897 --> 06:39.440
She signed a non-compete.

06:39.524 --> 06:40.858
With the Gilbert Group,

06:40.942 --> 06:43.528
whose lawyers
do not take these matters lightly.

06:43.611 --> 06:45.655
Then have them call my lawyers.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.866
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a meeting with my new CFO.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.246
Alfie?

06:53.788 --> 06:54.872
[Alfie] Hello, Emily.

06:54.956 --> 06:58.626
Wait, you're the new CFO?
You're supposed to be in London.

06:58.709 --> 07:00.294
Well, Antoine offered me a job.

07:00.711 --> 07:03.297
I was going to tell you,
but it's just been so busy.

07:03.381 --> 07:06.134
You've been in Paris this whole time
without telling me?

07:06.217 --> 07:10.638
Okay. Why don't you two lovebirds sidebar
this conversation for your own time?

07:11.180 --> 07:13.516
-Let's go.
-You'll be hearing from our lawyers.

07:14.725 --> 07:16.686
So you're suing me for not calling you?

07:18.938 --> 07:21.607
Emily, I just need to know.
Are you on my team or not?

07:21.691 --> 07:22.692
Yes, of course I am.

07:22.775 --> 07:24.026
Then how did you not know

07:24.110 --> 07:27.071
your own boyfriend's here in Paris
working with Antoine?

07:27.155 --> 07:30.241
Because, I guess, he's not my boyfriend.

07:30.324 --> 07:31.242
[sighs]

07:31.367 --> 07:33.703
Emily, I am sorry,
but you are getting played.

07:33.870 --> 07:34.745
We both are.

07:35.413 --> 07:37.915
Try not to disappoint me a third time?

07:52.430 --> 07:53.473
<i>-Bonjour.</i>
<i>-Bonjour.</i>

07:53.556 --> 07:55.808
-[in French] Glass of white wine, please.
-Of course.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.977
[in English] It's not nice to drink alone.

07:58.060 --> 07:58.936
Hi!

07:59.020 --> 08:00.688
-Can I join?
-Yeah, of course.

08:02.899 --> 08:04.859
And it's not nice to eat alone either,

08:04.942 --> 08:07.445
which is what I do most nights
waiting for Gabriel.

08:07.528 --> 08:09.780
-The life of the chef's girlfriend.
-[Gabriel] Hey.

08:11.115 --> 08:11.991
<i>Salut, mon amour.</i>

08:12.074 --> 08:13.159
Emily, this is a surprise.

08:13.242 --> 08:14.410
Hi.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.871
So I have some interesting news.

08:17.538 --> 08:20.208
Alfie is in Paris working for Antoine.

08:21.209 --> 08:23.336
I think I'm wanted in the kitchen.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.296
Wait, you knew?

08:25.880 --> 08:26.964
We both did.

08:27.507 --> 08:28.799
Did he finally call you?

08:28.925 --> 08:29.759
No!

08:29.842 --> 08:32.970
I walked into Antoine's
and they introduced me to his new CFO.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.556
He asked us not to say anything.
He wanted to tell you himself.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.850
But you guys are my friends.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.894
I wish he didn't put us in the middle.

08:42.647 --> 08:44.815
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

08:44.899 --> 08:47.485
You've kept things from me before,
didn't you?

08:49.195 --> 08:51.822
Sorry, I should have told you about Alfie.

08:52.323 --> 08:54.408
Look, I really
want to be friends, Camille.

08:54.992 --> 08:57.703
And that means
we have to trust each other.

08:57.870 --> 08:58.871
I want that, too.

08:59.622 --> 09:00.540
I really do.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.209
Hey, Cooper.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.419
I'll let you two talk.

09:09.006 --> 09:11.968
So I guess everyone knows
you stayed in Paris except for me.

09:13.928 --> 09:16.764
What's going on?
How did you end up working with Antoine?

09:16.931 --> 09:20.977
I got to spend a lot of time with him
at my going-away party that you missed.

09:22.061 --> 09:25.982
I had a few ideas about Maison Lavaux
and I guess he really liked them.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.609
-This all happened at the party?
-No, not all.

09:29.360 --> 09:32.655
You see, once I got to London,
Antoine asked if I could come back.

09:32.738 --> 09:33.906
He wanted to hear more.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.032
So I did.

09:35.533 --> 09:41.247
And by the end of this amazing lunch,
he asked me to be his CFO.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.875
I mean, it all happened pretty fast.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.961
So why keep it all from me?

09:47.044 --> 09:51.048
I was picking up the hints
that you and I weren't on the same page.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.261
I didn't want you to think
I was coming back to Paris for you.

09:55.344 --> 09:57.346
No, I'm really sorry you felt that way.

09:58.472 --> 09:59.849
I didn't make this up.

10:01.642 --> 10:05.896
I put myself out there,
and you left me hanging.

10:08.399 --> 10:10.234
I… I don't know what to say.

10:13.112 --> 10:14.697
You don't have to say anything.

10:16.991 --> 10:21.996
It's been really nice to see you, Cooper.

10:25.249 --> 10:26.250
Dinner's on Antoine.

10:45.603 --> 10:46.437
[door opening]

10:50.274 --> 10:52.485
Oh, my God,
Alfie's been here the whole time.

10:52.568 --> 10:53.819
How did you know?

10:53.903 --> 10:55.363
We basically live in a dorm.

10:55.446 --> 10:57.281
I ran into Camille crossing the quad

10:57.365 --> 10:59.533
and I heard you two were
having drinks in the commons.

10:59.617 --> 11:00.451
[laughs]

11:01.702 --> 11:03.996
-But seriously, are you okay?
-No.

11:04.872 --> 11:06.165
I'm just confused.

11:06.248 --> 11:10.169
I'm kind of mad, but he looked so good.

11:10.252 --> 11:11.545
-Suit?
-Suit.

11:12.129 --> 11:13.381
Spread collar shirt.

11:13.464 --> 11:16.258
I wanted to poke my finger
above his tie knot and pull it down.

11:16.342 --> 11:17.343
Hot.

11:17.426 --> 11:20.388
He said he felt like he put himself
out there and I didn't reciprocate.

11:20.471 --> 11:22.556
-Well, you didn't.
-Well, I was wrong.

11:22.640 --> 11:26.102
And now he's really hurt
and he's completely closed off.

11:26.185 --> 11:27.353
And he's working for Antoine!

11:27.436 --> 11:29.271
-That's--
-How crazy is that?

11:29.355 --> 11:31.482

No, no, he's hurt,

out there if you want him back.

12:05.599 --> 12:09.687
Yeah, well, the American dream
turned into the French nightmare.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.735
Best to you as well.

12:15.818 --> 12:19.780
[in French] You're gonna make some other
marketing firm really happy one day.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.449
<i>Voilà. Au revoir. Au revoir.</i>

12:22.241 --> 12:23.617
This is so hard.

12:23.701 --> 12:25.828
Madeline sent emails
to all of our clients,

12:25.911 --> 12:27.204
they want to know what's happening.

12:28.247 --> 12:31.167
All our business is kaput.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.169
No, we still have Pierre Cadault.

12:33.252 --> 12:36.297
And the non-compete clause is only valid
for one year, it's not forever.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.007
So we have no clients.

12:38.132 --> 12:40.259
We'll find new ones, Julien.

12:40.885 --> 12:43.846
You didn't think starting a business
was going to be easy, did you?

12:44.597 --> 12:45.639
No.

12:51.145 --> 12:53.856
[in English] Hey, Madeline,
can I get your approval on…

12:53.939 --> 12:55.524
<i>-Bonjour!</i>
-Oh, you're pumping!

12:55.608 --> 12:57.359
Yeah. Jack's on a nursing strike.

12:57.443 --> 12:58.277
So French.

12:58.360 --> 12:59.278
[chuckles]

12:59.361 --> 13:02.239
Anyway, I'm happy to report
that the non-compete went out.

13:02.323 --> 13:03.908
I bet Sylvie shit her pants.

13:04.492 --> 13:06.368
Is this the best course of action?

13:06.452 --> 13:08.996
It's not necessarily
driving business our way.

13:09.079 --> 13:11.665
Yes, but it's keeping it
out of Sylvie's hands

13:11.749 --> 13:13.876
while we find ourselves
a French president.

13:14.877 --> 13:18.339
You know what someone said to me recently
when I was in a tough spot?

13:18.422 --> 13:20.674
Push. Even when it hurts.

13:33.646 --> 13:34.688
-Hey!
-Hi!

13:34.772 --> 13:36.106
-Luc!
-Emily!

13:37.107 --> 13:39.026
I've missed you.

13:39.109 --> 13:40.444
I missed you, too.

13:42.822 --> 13:46.408
If Madeline hadn't come back out here,
we'd still be working together.

13:46.492 --> 13:50.538
-True, but Sylvie's ego is also to blame.
-Mmm.

13:50.788 --> 13:52.164
I know she's hurting,

13:52.248 --> 13:57.169
but we built up so many relationships
over the years just to lose them.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.004
I feel terrible.

13:59.129 --> 14:00.422
We are all suffering.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.759
I am usually like a big cock.

14:04.635 --> 14:05.469
What?

14:05.553 --> 14:08.514
You know, proud, tall,
protector of the flock.

14:08.597 --> 14:09.557
A rooster.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.100
Yes! The rooster.

14:11.183 --> 14:14.812
The cock, or the rooster,
is a symbol in France.

14:15.604 --> 14:18.065
Able to sing
even when their feet are in the shit.

14:18.607 --> 14:19.525
That is me.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.360
But right now…

14:23.195 --> 14:24.780
even I cannot sing.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.408
Then I think we need
to do something about it.

14:28.492 --> 14:31.579
I am going to walk the labyrinth
at the <i>Jardin des Plantes.</i>

14:31.662 --> 14:32.997
Would you like to join me?

14:33.664 --> 14:36.208
Actually, we're interviewing
for a new president of Savoir

14:36.292 --> 14:38.252
and I have just the person for the job,

14:38.335 --> 14:40.421
but I'm going to need your help.

14:45.509 --> 14:49.221
Why didn't I think of this before?
Luc, you're the perfect candidate!

14:49.305 --> 14:52.683
You've got the experience,
you know the brands, you know luxury.

14:52.766 --> 14:54.768
No, no. No, no, no. It's not me.

14:54.935 --> 14:58.981
There's only one person
who is right for this role.

14:59.106 --> 15:00.524
And that is…

15:01.650 --> 15:02.484
Sylvie.

15:03.611 --> 15:04.570
I'm sorry. What?

15:04.653 --> 15:06.405
Sylvie has all the relationships.

15:06.822 --> 15:09.533
Pierre, Lavaux, Zimmer, Rimowa.

15:09.617 --> 15:12.661
All those clients want to work with her.
Not with me.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.205
She's what Chicago
bought in the first place.

15:15.372 --> 15:18.417
The only one
who can replace Sylvie is Sylvie.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.711
Okay. This is an ambush.

15:20.794 --> 15:23.213
We are hurting. You're hurting.

15:23.297 --> 15:25.007
Sylvie's pride is damaged.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.216
You made your point.

15:26.300 --> 15:32.181
And now you need to apologize
and to beg her to come back.

15:32.848 --> 15:34.975
Why don't I just stab myself in the eye?

15:35.059 --> 15:38.896
And the French love flattery.

15:39.063 --> 15:41.899
You have to talk to French people
in a certain way.

15:41.982 --> 15:44.151
They like to hear sweet things.

15:44.735 --> 15:47.446
<i>"Bonjour, bonsoir, après vous, merci."</i>

15:47.529 --> 15:50.783
Remember. French is
the language of diplomacy.

15:50.991 --> 15:51.909
[sighs]

15:51.992 --> 15:54.703
And you have an opportunity here
to be a diplomat.

15:55.245 --> 15:57.373
Ambassador Madeline Wheeler, anyone?

15:57.456 --> 15:59.500
-Yeah?
-[chuckles] That's stupid.

16:00.709 --> 16:02.336
Plus, Sylvie won't want to meet me.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.840
I know where she'll be tonight.

16:07.007 --> 16:08.676
And you can be there, too.

16:08.842 --> 16:13.389
Come to Pierre Cadault's retrospective
at costume museum. Both of you.

16:13.472 --> 16:17.142
This is the perfect place for you
and Sylvie to bump into each other.

16:17.226 --> 16:18.811
What a <i>bonne idée.</i>

16:18.894 --> 16:21.271
Not such a <i>bonne idée</i> in my book.

16:22.314 --> 16:23.941
I may be running out of options.

16:24.024 --> 16:25.150
[groans]

16:28.153 --> 16:30.572
Any tips on where I can
find a dress last minute?

16:31.073 --> 16:32.199
<i>Bien sûr.</i>

16:56.390 --> 16:57.808
So cool!

16:57.891 --> 16:59.184
<i>Ne touchez pas, madame!</i>

16:59.351 --> 17:00.811
[chuckles]

17:01.603 --> 17:03.355
Sorry, I can't help myself.

17:03.439 --> 17:06.316
No, no, no.
I should not be <i>touche-ing</i> the couture.

17:06.900 --> 17:08.861
This was a very special collection.

17:08.944 --> 17:12.281
Put Pierre back on the map
for a lot of people, so I totally get it.

17:12.781 --> 17:13.782
Nicolas de Leon.

17:13.866 --> 17:17.161
Yes, I know, of course.
I know everything about you.

17:17.244 --> 17:19.079
Your father runs JVMA,

17:19.163 --> 17:21.707
home to almost every important
luxury brand.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.792
He has three sons, all in the business.

17:23.876 --> 17:27.296
You are the youngest, but you're
supposed to be most like your dad,

17:27.379 --> 17:29.548
all the way down
to his love of racing cars.

17:30.299 --> 17:31.800
Emily Cooper, Savoir.

17:31.925 --> 17:32.885
Savoir!

17:33.427 --> 17:35.220
You are all behind Ringard,

17:35.304 --> 17:37.681
the collection
that's reinvented Pierre Cadault.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.725
-[chuckles]
-I know a few things, too.

17:39.808 --> 17:42.019
Well, then you know
how successful we can be.

17:42.519 --> 17:46.398
I would love to meet you for lunch or
a drink to discuss your marketing needs.

17:46.523 --> 17:48.108
If you've really done your homework,

17:48.192 --> 17:51.403
you would know that we do our marketing
for all of our brands in-house,

17:52.738 --> 17:55.365
-but I hope we can still have that drink.
-Of course.

17:59.870 --> 18:02.206
Excuse me.
I just saw a friend of mine walk in.

18:09.963 --> 18:10.964
What are you doing here?

18:11.048 --> 18:13.258
I'm just stealing your shine,
as per usual.

18:13.342 --> 18:15.344
Take it. I have too much.

18:16.011 --> 18:17.888
My plus one arrived.

18:17.971 --> 18:19.515
Where's my other plus one?

18:19.598 --> 18:20.432
Um…

18:20.516 --> 18:21.350
Pumping.

18:22.893 --> 18:25.312
It's such a struggle
not working with you guys.

18:25.395 --> 18:28.732
Hopefully, after tonight,
everything will be fixed.

18:28.816 --> 18:31.527
Madeline is going to ask Sylvie
to come back to Savoir!

18:34.446 --> 18:36.365
I… I don't think it's that shocking.

18:36.448 --> 18:37.950
It's a couture car crash.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.169
<i>Oh, merde!</i>

18:49.795 --> 18:50.796
[exhales]

18:52.256 --> 18:53.590
<i>Bonsoir,</i> Sylvie.

18:53.757 --> 18:54.883
[chuckles]

18:55.425 --> 18:57.261
Well, you definitely wore it better.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.350
Really, Madeline?

19:05.144 --> 19:06.895
First Savoir, now this?

19:07.896 --> 19:10.315
Are you actually trying to be me?

19:10.566 --> 19:11.733
[laughs]

19:11.817 --> 19:13.402
Wow, Sylvie.

19:13.485 --> 19:14.653
Where did you get that?

19:14.736 --> 19:16.071
At Louez le Runway.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.322
It's a rental?

19:18.198 --> 19:19.241
That's disgusting.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.994
No, they have
a very rigorous cleaning process.

19:24.913 --> 19:25.831
[clears throat]

19:25.914 --> 19:26.957
Look, uh…

19:28.542 --> 19:29.418
Sylvie.

19:30.669 --> 19:33.881
I may be able to put on the dress,
but you…

19:34.965 --> 19:37.509
have a way with clients and culture…

19:38.468 --> 19:40.554
I can't even begin to emulate.

19:40.637 --> 19:44.057
I took for granted
what you bring to the company and…

19:45.267 --> 19:46.226
I am…

19:47.352 --> 19:48.437
I'm sorry.

19:49.313 --> 19:51.565
But let's be honest. We're both suffering.

19:51.648 --> 19:54.902
I don't want to beg, but, well, here I am.

19:56.028 --> 20:01.325
We would love to have you back
as president of Savoir.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.411
Wait. Let me understand.

20:04.494 --> 20:08.624
First you try to destroy my company,
then you want me to work for you?

20:08.707 --> 20:09.791
With me.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.169
And with a substantial
pay package increase,

20:12.252 --> 20:15.631
including taking off
the entire month of August,

20:15.714 --> 20:19.593
something we in America
only can dream about.

20:19.676 --> 20:20.510
[chuckles]

20:20.636 --> 20:21.929
Oh. [chuckles]

20:22.346 --> 20:23.513
What a tempting offer.

20:23.889 --> 20:24.932
[chuckles]

20:25.224 --> 20:28.310
Will I still have the pleasure
of reporting to the board in Chicago?

20:28.393 --> 20:30.270
Well, the pleasure would be theirs.

20:30.354 --> 20:32.564
Perhaps I could visit
corporate headquarters?

20:33.523 --> 20:38.278
How about a Cubs game
and a tour of the Loop?

20:38.362 --> 20:40.489
Let's not forget the deep dish pizza.

20:40.572 --> 20:42.449
Until it's coming out of your ears.

20:42.574 --> 20:43.533
[both laugh]

20:45.077 --> 20:48.121
Oh, God, you make it sound so enticing.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.083
But…

20:52.793 --> 20:56.964
me and an American company,
it's like you in that dress.

20:58.048 --> 21:00.092
It just doesn't fit.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.387
[Madeline clears throat]

21:04.680 --> 21:05.889
Sylvie, come on.

21:06.723 --> 21:08.475
You're down to one client.

21:08.642 --> 21:09.476
Yeah.

21:10.185 --> 21:14.189
I may only have Pierre
but one marquee client is enough.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.858
[Pierre] May I have
your attention everyone, please?

21:18.110 --> 21:22.364
[in French] Thank you
to the Decorative Arts Museum

21:22.447 --> 21:23.991
for this wonderful tribute.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.536
So many beautiful memories here.

21:28.453 --> 21:30.914
I've been blessed with a long career.

21:31.206 --> 21:36.044
And I look forward
to it getting even bigger.

21:36.128 --> 21:40.382
[in English] And that is why
I'm thrilled to announce

21:40.465 --> 21:45.721
that JVMA will be
acquiring Pierre Cadault.

21:47.264 --> 21:48.640
[crowd applauding]

21:52.978 --> 21:54.646
-Did you know about this?
-No.

21:54.730 --> 21:57.065
This is a shock.
Even worse than the dresses.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.109
JVMA doesn't work
with outside marketing firms,

21:59.192 --> 22:01.236
which means that Pierre
is going to drop Sylvie.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.738
Well, well, well.

22:02.821 --> 22:05.240
Seems like you're now
down to zero clients.

22:05.907 --> 22:07.576
And my offer just expired.

22:08.577 --> 22:10.996
And for the record,
I think I wore it better.

22:18.962 --> 22:19.963
[sighs]

22:20.630 --> 22:23.175
[in French] I really wish you'd
talked to us

22:23.258 --> 22:24.718
before turning down Madeline's offer.

22:25.844 --> 22:28.263
-Are you joking?
-Oh, no.

22:28.930 --> 22:31.516
We sacrificed a lot to work with you.

22:36.772 --> 22:37.606
Julien.

22:42.819 --> 22:44.863
[in English] Pierre, over here!
Give us a smile.

22:44.946 --> 22:47.824
[in French] I have to say, I feel a little
blindsided, Pierre.

22:47.908 --> 22:51.036
Until the deal was final,
I had to keep it secret.

22:51.119 --> 22:53.830
I promise we'll talk tomorrow.

22:53.914 --> 22:57.626
But tonight is about Cadault, not Grateau.

22:58.085 --> 22:59.127
[chuckles]

22:59.211 --> 23:02.422
[in English] Smile, darling.
Smile, my dear.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.506
Sylvie, thank you for meeting me.

23:45.715 --> 23:49.678
Well, congratulations on your acquisition.

23:52.514 --> 23:55.976
Not sure why we're meeting.
I know you do all your marketing in-house.

23:56.184 --> 23:57.310
Yes, we do.

23:58.061 --> 24:00.564
But I love the work
Savoir has done with Pierre…

24:01.273 --> 24:04.860
I'd like to bring you on board
to work for the Cadault line exclusively.

24:08.155 --> 24:08.989
Well.

24:12.200 --> 24:16.663
I have a firm now
and staff to think about.

24:17.164 --> 24:19.332
We expect you to bring your own staff.

24:22.002 --> 24:26.173
As much as I love Pierre, I've never
worked with only one client.

24:27.257 --> 24:30.886
As I understand it, right now,
you don't have any clients.

24:32.095 --> 24:34.014
I believe I'm throwing you a lifeline.

24:35.015 --> 24:37.017
Well, thank you for your generous offer.

24:39.311 --> 24:41.855
Let me think about it
and I'll get back to you.

24:44.065 --> 24:45.775
You have until the end of the day.

24:47.402 --> 24:50.530
It's the longest day of the year.
Should give you enough time.

25:01.249 --> 25:03.210
[in French] So what happens
to Agence Grateau?

25:05.170 --> 25:07.756
It dissolves.
We would be employees of JVMA.

25:07.839 --> 25:09.966
I know you made a sacrifice
to come with me

25:10.050 --> 25:12.135
and so I wanted to discuss this with you.

25:12.219 --> 25:14.262
It's a good offer.

25:17.474 --> 25:20.894
It's a huge company.
I'm sure there are amazing benefits.

25:20.977 --> 25:22.687
You'll have your holidays.

25:22.771 --> 25:25.649
You won't have to worry,
everything will be taken care of.

25:25.732 --> 25:26.983
We'll all be secure.

25:30.278 --> 25:31.863
What do you think, Luc?

25:35.700 --> 25:37.160
I say stick to your guns, Sylvie.

25:38.870 --> 25:40.288
We can do this.

25:40.872 --> 25:44.292
You didn't think starting a business
would be easy, did you?

25:44.543 --> 25:45.627
Are you sure?

25:46.336 --> 25:47.337
Yes!

25:52.092 --> 25:53.051
Yes!

25:53.176 --> 25:54.678
[sighs in relief]

25:55.136 --> 25:56.429
Thank you.

25:59.474 --> 26:02.269

26:31.089 --> 26:33.675
You know, I'll give it to Paris.

26:33.758 --> 26:37.053
Even when you're having a bad day,
the city is looking great.

26:37.637 --> 26:42.392
It's feeling good, it's having fun,
and it kind of rubs off on you, you know?

26:42.475 --> 26:44.394
Solstice is a very important time
of the year.

26:44.477 --> 26:45.979
It brings so much opportunity.

26:46.062 --> 26:50.650
Yeah. It's like the sun saying,
"Okay, let's try this again."

[Alfie] Gabriel!

26:53.778 --> 26:54.863

-Hey.

26:54.946 --> 26:56.781
-Good you could make it.
-How's it going?

26:57.324 --> 26:59.326
-Hi.
-Hey.

27:00.201 --> 27:01.036
So…

27:01.870 --> 27:04.998
I was thinking and you were right.

27:06.082 --> 27:08.835
I wasn't giving you all you deserve.

27:08.918 --> 27:11.129
And after you left,
all I could think about

27:11.212 --> 27:14.591
was how much I miss you
and how much I messed up.

27:14.674 --> 27:16.301
Look, if you don't mind, Cooper,

27:16.384 --> 27:17.927
I've had a really long day,

27:18.011 --> 27:21.264
and I'd rather not talk about
our relationship history right now.

27:22.265 --> 27:23.642

You wouldn't answer
the club owner's calls,

and he accepted the offer for you.
