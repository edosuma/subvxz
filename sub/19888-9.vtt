How you doing in there?

(THUMPING, STRUGGLING)

00:18.719 --> 00:20.354
Sorry we had to trunk you,

00:20.388 --> 00:23.057
you almost clawed one of my
abbot's eyes out about there.

00:23.091 --> 00:25.093
-No hard feelings, I hope.
-(STRUGGLING)

00:26.094 --> 00:27.628
You're a vicious little thing,
aren't you?

00:29.363 --> 00:31.365
Doesn't usually take three
of us to get the job done,

00:31.799 --> 00:34.268
but you were jumping about
like a flea with an itchy ass.

00:35.203 --> 00:36.204
Ooh.

00:37.305 --> 00:39.373
Look at that. Adorable.

(CHUCKLES)

02:35.489 --> 02:36.890
Where did you get this book?

02:40.494 --> 02:41.495
You can trust me.

02:42.530 --> 02:46.234
Father. He gave it to me
before he disappeared.

02:47.235 --> 02:48.336
(SIGHS)

02:50.638 --> 02:52.573
(CHUCKLES) Can you read it?

02:56.310 --> 02:58.446
Father only taught
me one word...

Azra.

Azra.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.293
Well, that's a good start.

03:14.362 --> 03:15.929
This book...

03:17.030 --> 03:19.533
This stays between us, okay?

03:22.002 --> 03:24.805
I'm Bajie. What's your name?

Minerva.

03:27.908 --> 03:28.909
Well, Minerva,

03:29.743 --> 03:31.245
it seems that dear Mother Fate

03:31.279 --> 03:32.946
has brought us together
for a reason.

You've been busy.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.442
Well, the system's been
broken far too long.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.043
I'm making
strides to change things.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.480
Strides like getting into
bed with men like Quinn?

04:39.980 --> 04:41.982
Aligning with Quinn was
a necessary evil,

04:42.015 --> 04:43.351
but that's over now.

04:44.552 --> 04:45.953
Against him, you're gonna
need all the help you can get.

04:46.987 --> 04:48.088
That mean you're
coming with me?

04:48.121 --> 04:50.524
Oh, he's a danger to everyone,
your family included.

04:55.763 --> 04:57.665
I'm gonna need
you to protect M.K.

04:58.366 --> 04:59.967
Of course. He'll be safe here.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.770
Just so you know,
his powers are gone now.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.573
When he's cut,
he bleeds like the rest of us.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.609
Yeah, just in case
you guys were wondering.

05:09.777 --> 05:12.680
Well, the Gift
is a heavy burden, it's, uh,

05:12.713 --> 05:13.881
it's probably for the best.

You're welcome as
a guest in my home.

05:16.584 --> 05:18.486

you show M.K. to his quarters?

05:19.019 --> 05:20.320
Yes, Mother.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.362
Would you see
that Sunny's provided with

05:28.396 --> 05:30.030
a change of clothes?
We don't want our troops

Who are you?

06:33.060 --> 06:34.428
Isn't it obvious?

06:35.729 --> 06:36.897
I'm a bloody Cog,

06:37.998 --> 06:39.733
and I've come
to seek sanctuary...

06:41.201 --> 06:42.269
In the, in the Sanctuary.

06:44.505 --> 06:47.841
A little too well-fed
for a Cog. Who was your Baron?

Uh, Baron Chau.

Baron Bitch-Face.

07:03.624 --> 07:08.729
I escaped her slave pens
by the skin of my teeth,

07:09.229 --> 07:13.100
and now I am here to swear
allegiance to The Widow.

07:15.235 --> 07:17.037
Whoa. Oh...

07:18.639 --> 07:20.708
Fine. It'll be like that.

07:22.976 --> 07:25.546
It is better to die
at the gates of freedom

07:26.780 --> 07:29.783
than to rot in the shackles
of servitude.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.522

Get on with it then.

free from it, your power?

08:09.189 --> 08:11.659
Uh, yeah, it seems like it.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.261
Do you think it'll come back?

08:16.263 --> 08:17.531
I hope not.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.036
I've spent so much of my life
trying to control it...

08:26.874 --> 08:27.875
Now that it's gone,

08:30.611 --> 08:31.612
I feel free.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.149
Now I can just focus on Azra.

It...

09:17.024 --> 09:18.125
but things have changed.

09:19.927 --> 09:21.629
I've met someone.

to speak to you.

I was telling you about?

Odessa.

is a friend of mine.

Odessa. Odessa? Odessa!

10:25.693 --> 10:26.927
What's the matter with you?

10:27.294 --> 10:28.729
You have to
stay away from him.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.397
(SIGHS) That wasn't
what it looked like.

10:31.398 --> 10:32.800
You think I'm jealous?

10:32.833 --> 10:34.101
I'm trying to protect you.

10:34.334 --> 10:36.103
He's not what you think he is.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.371
He has a dark side.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.241
How do you know
about M.K.'s power?

10:41.975 --> 10:42.976
Because I've seen it.

10:49.182 --> 10:52.820
I was part of a Cog shipment,
being traded up river.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.089
So was your friend...

11:00.260 --> 11:03.731
He slaughtered every single
person on that ship,

11:04.031 --> 11:05.833
as easy as
a child stands on an anthill.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.736
That's not...

11:08.769 --> 11:10.137
That's not him anymore.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.139
Tell that to
the Cogs he murdered.

11:12.806 --> 11:15.142
When it happens,
he, he doesn't remember.

11:17.277 --> 11:18.411
Well, I remember.

11:21.014 --> 11:24.284
And you know what I saw
in those black eyes?

11:25.318 --> 11:26.386
He liked it.

11:28.288 --> 11:29.857
I don't care what he says,

11:29.890 --> 11:32.159
something like that
never goes away.

11:33.093 --> 11:35.896
Promise me, please,

11:36.830 --> 11:38.131
that you will stay
away from him.

11:42.435 --> 11:43.436
(SCOFFS)

12:09.262 --> 12:10.330
What is it?

12:11.364 --> 12:12.833
Just taste it.

12:26.213 --> 12:28.315
-Mmm. Mmm!
-(LAUGHS)

12:29.382 --> 12:31.318
Congratulations, Gabriel.

12:31.351 --> 12:35.322
You're now part of a very
select, very rarefied society.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.891
One of only two men
in this entire army

12:37.925 --> 12:41.995
to have ever tasted ice cream.

12:43.230 --> 12:44.231
Hmm.

12:46.299 --> 12:47.534
And that's not all that

12:47.567 --> 12:50.804
separates us
from the rest of them.

12:51.038 --> 12:55.142
I've always sensed
a fire in your blood,

12:55.175 --> 12:56.877
burning for purpose.

12:56.910 --> 12:57.911
Hmm.

12:59.980 --> 13:00.981
Am I wrong?

13:03.851 --> 13:04.952
No, Baron.

13:07.254 --> 13:08.555
When I was your age,

13:09.256 --> 13:10.824
I wanted to do more than

13:10.858 --> 13:12.392
collect little black
lines on my skin.

13:13.126 --> 13:16.864
I wanted to carve my name
in the world's flesh,

13:18.198 --> 13:19.466
like a scar.

13:21.869 --> 13:24.537
And I sense that
same need in you.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.311
Yes, Baron.

13:46.626 --> 13:48.128
Not with a whimper...

13:52.900 --> 13:53.901
But a bang.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.095
-Why did you call for me?
-(HENRY CRYING)

14:24.497 --> 14:28.168
A man needs no reason to
spend time with his family.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.537
Hmm? Yeah.

14:30.570 --> 14:31.604
(CHUCKLES)

14:35.275 --> 14:36.143
You've been awfully quiet

14:36.176 --> 14:38.145
since the news
of Sunny's resurrection.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.081
Why waste my
breath on a dead man?

14:44.484 --> 14:45.585
Is that what you want?

14:47.487 --> 14:51.158
For Henry to see the only
father he has known

14:52.225 --> 14:54.061
murdered by a stranger?

14:55.695 --> 14:56.964
Sunny's not a stranger.

14:56.997 --> 14:57.998
(GRUNTS)

14:59.432 --> 15:01.634
He can't kill me, hmm?

15:02.469 --> 15:04.371
Not even with
The Widow on his side.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.474
He failed once,
he'll fail again.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.044
I'm your husband now.

15:13.981 --> 15:15.415
Now and forever.

Oh, don't you look
so surprised.

15:40.207 --> 15:43.110
You've always
been drawn to men of violence.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.545
Everything all right?

15:46.446 --> 15:47.614
Just a lover's tiff.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.287
We'll let her cool
off in the ventilation room.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.690
No. No!

15:58.525 --> 16:00.293

Give me my baby!

-Quinn, give me my baby!
-Embrace me as family, Veil.

16:03.430 --> 16:04.964
Just as Henry has.

VEIL: Give me my baby!

16:07.234 --> 16:10.170
I'd hate for you to grow up
without your mama.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.711
Hush, little baby...

16:20.513 --> 16:21.514
Don't you cry...

16:39.699 --> 16:40.167
WALDO: Same old Sunny.

16:42.469 --> 16:43.636
Just back from the dead,

16:43.670 --> 16:45.372
already found
a new way to die.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.275
Let me guess,

16:49.109 --> 16:50.443
you think this plan's crazy.

16:52.579 --> 16:53.613
Among other things.

16:54.614 --> 16:56.749
Well, I guess that means
neither of us has changed.

16:57.717 --> 17:00.487
Unless, of course,
you count changing sides.

17:01.288 --> 17:02.689
Feel free to judge me,

17:04.524 --> 17:07.026
but being adaptable
is what's kept me alive.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.362
When's the last time you
fought for yourself

17:09.629 --> 17:10.630
instead of for someone else?

17:11.598 --> 17:13.766
Whoever I fight for,
I fight smart.

17:15.102 --> 17:17.036
You might try that
yourself sometime.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.272
That isn't a plan,

17:19.306 --> 17:21.474
that's a one-way
ticket to an early grave.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.510
My family doesn't
have any other choice.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.345
If I taught you anything,

17:25.678 --> 17:28.781
it's to leave your
emotions outside the equation.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.817
My emotions are
what's kept me alive.

17:31.618 --> 17:32.719
(SIGHS)

17:34.387 --> 17:36.756
All right, let's say you do
make it through the tunnels,

17:37.357 --> 17:39.058
come face-to-face with Quinn.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.728
The man who took you in,
made you Regent,

17:41.761 --> 17:44.664
trained you to obey
every word he says.

17:45.132 --> 17:47.534
You think you're gonna be able
to deliver the death stroke?

17:48.135 --> 17:49.269
You've been there before.

17:50.303 --> 17:51.538
Last time I faced Quinn,
I didn't have an army.

17:52.472 --> 17:55.775
Yeah, The Widow,
and her Clippers.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.811
Just don't you
forget your training,

18:00.747 --> 18:02.115
keep an eye on your flank.

18:03.483 --> 18:04.584
Something you wanna tell me?

18:05.785 --> 18:07.187
Why, whatever do you mean?

18:08.388 --> 18:09.656
I'm not blind.

18:09.856 --> 18:11.724
Just because The Widow
and I want the same thing,

18:11.758 --> 18:13.293
doesn't mean
I trust her one bit.

18:14.694 --> 18:15.795
Where are you off to now?

18:16.196 --> 18:17.197
The Armory.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.301
You'll have to pass the Fort
to get to Quinn's bunker.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.804
So why don't you stop in
at my old Clipper shed.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.507
You'll find everything
you need inside.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.514
Consider it a farewell gift.

18:44.291 --> 18:45.592
So long, Sunshine.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.597
Goodbye, Waldo.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.385
Now I remember why
I married you first.

19:15.888 --> 19:16.889
What is it?

19:19.292 --> 19:21.160
I just always thought
you'd die on horseback,

19:21.494 --> 19:22.629
under a big sky,

19:23.663 --> 19:25.498
wind and blood in your hair.

19:26.899 --> 19:28.468
Not in this rat hole.

19:29.402 --> 19:31.904
You probably wish you were
miles away from here, hmm?

19:31.938 --> 19:32.939
Away from me.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.511
"Through sun
and through shadow,

19:39.546 --> 19:41.180
"I walk by your side."

19:41.514 --> 19:42.915
Isn't that what
we swore to each other?

19:43.350 --> 19:44.451
Indeed, it is.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.819
Veil swore the same words.

19:47.254 --> 19:49.689
At least she don't mock me
by pretending to believe them.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.825
I know your games, Lydia.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.828
Sweet words,
trying to placate the beast

19:55.862 --> 19:57.764
just long enough for Sunny
to come save you both.

19:58.365 --> 19:59.466
(CHUCKLES) That's not true.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.934
You think I don't know you
and Veil whisper together,

20:02.335 --> 20:04.537
conspiring to slit my throat?

20:09.442 --> 20:10.610
Baron.

20:11.744 --> 20:12.979
The tunnels are sealed.

20:13.012 --> 20:15.582
Good. I want
complete lockdown,

20:15.615 --> 20:17.750
no one goes in or out
until this is over.

20:18.685 --> 20:19.686
Jenkins.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.690
Proceed with the final step.

20:27.627 --> 20:28.728
What's going on?

20:29.796 --> 20:31.731
You can pray for my death
all you wish,

20:31.764 --> 20:34.834
just remember that as my wife,
our two fates are bound.

20:35.568 --> 20:38.638
If I go down, you go down.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.284
TILDA: Tighter!

21:05.898 --> 21:07.767
THE WIDOW: She'll make
a fine Baron someday.

21:08.701 --> 21:09.702
You know, she missed you.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.473
Your return has been
a welcome surprise,

21:15.007 --> 21:16.443
for all of us.

21:19.646 --> 21:21.348
I hope that you can find it
in your heart

21:21.381 --> 21:24.016
to forgive my behavior
during your last visit.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.554
My intentions were pure.

21:28.355 --> 21:29.422
Were they?

21:29.889 --> 21:31.324
I tried to help you.

21:31.858 --> 21:32.925
Haven't you been
listening to Sunny?

21:33.993 --> 21:36.062
My Gift, it's... It's gone.

21:38.431 --> 21:40.367
(INHALING) What if I told you
there are ways to...

21:41.033 --> 21:43.503
Reactivate your power?

21:48.107 --> 21:49.376
Where did you get this?

21:49.709 --> 21:52.779
It was taken from me,
but you knew that.

21:53.513 --> 21:55.782
Fortunately, it found its way
back to us.

21:58.385 --> 22:01.388
We can heal each other,
reclaim what's been lost.

22:04.724 --> 22:05.925
With our Gifts
restored we can end misery...

22:05.958 --> 22:07.927
No, no, I don't want
my Gift back.

22:09.462 --> 22:10.863
I've hurt too many people.

22:10.897 --> 22:12.331
But if you learn
to control it...

22:13.165 --> 22:15.535
(STUTTERING)
I don't want to control it.

22:16.903 --> 22:18.471
I'm free now.

22:18.938 --> 22:21.741
And what do you plan to do
with your newfound freedom,

22:22.442 --> 22:25.412
search for Azra? What
do you expect to find there?

22:28.615 --> 22:29.682
Peace.

22:30.717 --> 22:33.520
(SCOFFS) Think of Tilda,
think of all the lives

22:33.553 --> 22:35.555
we could save.
Don't they deserve peace, too?

22:36.689 --> 22:37.990
Anyway, you're free
to do as you wish,

22:40.026 --> 22:42.529
all I ask is you consider
my proposition

22:42.562 --> 22:43.763
before your long journey.

23:11.157 --> 23:11.524
What's going on?

(HORSE WHINNYING)

23:39.118 --> 23:40.419
I'm ready.

23:41.521 --> 23:43.523
We should reach
Quinn's bunker by sunset.

23:44.657 --> 23:46.693
And when the fight's over
and Quinn's dead?

23:47.660 --> 23:48.995
What then?

23:49.028 --> 23:51.764
You embrace your family,
and we go our separate ways.

23:52.264 --> 23:54.033
Simple enough,
wouldn't you say? Hmm?

23:56.035 --> 23:57.236
Somehow, I don't think

23:57.269 --> 23:58.705
anything's ever
simple with you.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.743
I've just as much
to lose as you.

24:03.776 --> 24:04.877
What more do you need
to be convinced

24:04.911 --> 24:06.078
I'm acting in good faith?

It's not for you, Baron.

24:42.849 --> 24:44.216
It's for him.

24:44.784 --> 24:45.785
From Veil.

24:46.786 --> 24:48.521
Quinn's just trying
to get inside of your head.

24:48.555 --> 24:50.489
-Kill him now.
-Let him speak.

(HORSE WHINNYING)

24:53.826 --> 24:54.994
Is she all right?

24:55.695 --> 24:56.863
She's the Baron's new wife.

24:57.830 --> 24:58.865
What?

24:58.898 --> 25:00.066
Veil wants to let you know

25:01.033 --> 25:02.769
that her son, Henry,
recognizes Quinn

25:02.802 --> 25:03.803
as his true father.

25:04.671 --> 25:05.905
That's not possible.

25:05.938 --> 25:07.173
The Widow is not your ally.

25:07.907 --> 25:09.576
If you march with her
on Quinn,

25:09.609 --> 25:12.545
with her forces beside you,
you march to your own death.

25:12.579 --> 25:14.180
He's lying. Quinn's afraid,

25:14.213 --> 25:15.682
he's just
trying to turn you against me.

Okay then,
then what's our plan?

29:37.543 --> 29:38.845

33:20.166 --> 33:22.334
I give you shelter and
this is how you repay me?

33:22.601 --> 33:24.270
All you care about is
what I can do for you.

33:24.503 --> 33:27.439
Oh, and you think Bajie's
intentions are genuine?

33:27.473 --> 33:30.076
He'll abandon you
the first chance he gets,

33:31.477 --> 33:33.479
just like he abandoned me.

33:40.286 --> 33:43.522
We're not leaving
without the book, Minerva.

33:45.624 --> 33:47.093
Come and get it.

33:50.662 --> 33:52.564
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

33:57.369 --> 33:59.471
I remember,
when I was a little girl,

33:59.505 --> 34:02.508
you vowed to help me decipher
this book's secrets.

34:20.692 --> 34:21.393
I haven't been
through here before.

34:23.129 --> 34:24.530
Isn't the other way faster?

34:24.563 --> 34:26.798
Tunnel's closed off.
Baron's orders.

34:27.566 --> 34:28.600
(KEYS JANGLING)

34:59.865 --> 35:01.800
Henry! Oh...

35:01.833 --> 35:02.834
Here you go.

35:04.570 --> 35:07.573
Hey. My poor, poor baby.

35:08.740 --> 35:09.741
Hey.

35:10.609 --> 35:11.610
Thank you.

35:12.844 --> 35:16.182
You were right,
I shouldn't have provoked him.

35:17.449 --> 35:18.617
(SIGHS) We just have to keep

35:18.650 --> 35:19.851
our heads
down a little longer.

35:19.885 --> 35:21.320
That's not gonna work anymore.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.622
Quinn has rigged
this entire place to explode.

35:25.757 --> 35:27.459
He will kill
every last one of us

35:27.493 --> 35:29.361
before he'll let anyone
take that child.

35:30.762 --> 35:33.532
We can't wait for Sunny
any longer,

35:33.565 --> 35:35.467
we're gonna have to
find our own way out of here.

35:35.734 --> 35:37.436
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

35:51.850 --> 35:53.252
I searched the woods
from here to the river,

35:53.285 --> 35:54.353
I couldn't find Sunny.

35:54.753 --> 35:57.556
Could not, or would not?

35:59.291 --> 36:00.392
I don't know what
you mean, Mother.

36:00.892 --> 36:01.893
"Baron."

36:06.898 --> 36:09.167
I need to know
that I can trust my Regent.

36:11.570 --> 36:13.939
Perhaps Quinn's paranoia
is rubbing off on you.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.447
Don't you play games with me.

36:30.522 --> 36:32.791
You've been acting differently
ever since Veil was here.

36:39.898 --> 36:41.700
All right, you wanna talk
about trust?

36:41.733 --> 36:42.901
Then where's M.K.?

36:45.304 --> 36:47.205
He wasn't in his room, so
what have you done with him?

36:47.439 --> 36:48.540
He's safe.

36:49.441 --> 36:50.542
Don't lie to me.

36:51.042 --> 36:52.244
Do you really think
I'd hurt him?

36:52.278 --> 36:53.144
I'm trying to protect him.

36:53.178 --> 36:54.413
What kind
of person do you think I am?

36:54.613 --> 36:55.714
I don't know anymore.

36:57.683 --> 36:59.318
Power's changed you.
Now you're

37:00.018 --> 37:03.255
willing to sacrifice innocent
lives for your own interests.

37:10.762 --> 37:14.466
I'd choose your next
words very carefully.

37:15.401 --> 37:16.868
You're no better
than any other Baron.

37:18.069 --> 37:20.372
Swindling people
with declarations of goodwill,

37:20.406 --> 37:21.807
only to stab them in the back.

37:24.042 --> 37:26.745
What did I do to deserve
such contempt?

37:26.778 --> 37:27.879
I gave you the world.

37:27.913 --> 37:29.014
Bullshit.

37:32.851 --> 37:34.753
You've got everyone fooled.

37:36.455 --> 37:37.456
Minerva.

37:41.460 --> 37:42.761
Everyone, but me.

37:44.730 --> 37:46.264
Maybe Veil was right.

37:50.869 --> 37:52.871
I should have poisoned
you when I had the chance.

38:00.612 --> 38:03.682
Now let's see how strong
you really are.

You brought this on yourself.
