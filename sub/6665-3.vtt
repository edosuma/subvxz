00:00.252 --> 00:01.872
<i>- My name is Nathan Fielder,</i>

00:02.392 --> 00:04.632
<i>and I graduated from one of
Canada's top business schools</i>

00:05.252 --> 00:07.252
<i>with really good grades.</i>

00:07.252 --> 00:08.292
<i>Now I'm using my knowledge</i>

00:08.312 --> 00:10.252
<i>to help struggling
small business owners</i>

00:10.252 --> 00:14.252
<i>make it in this
competitive world.</i>

00:14.252 --> 00:17.252
This is <i>Nathan For You.</i>

00:17.252 --> 00:19.252
<i>If you need to move
to a different house,</i>

00:19.252 --> 00:21.252
<i>you might call City of Angels,</i>

00:21.252 --> 00:23.252
<i>an up-and-coming
moving company</i>

00:23.252 --> 00:25.252
<i>that serves the L.A. area.</i>

00:25.252 --> 00:27.252
<i>But lately,
owner David Sassounian</i>

00:27.252 --> 00:29.252
<i>has been finding it hard
to stay profitable</i>

00:29.252 --> 00:32.252
<i>with the rising cost
of labor in his industry.</i>

00:32.252 --> 00:36.252
- For us, our most expensive
cost is our employees, for sure.

00:36.252 --> 00:39.252
<i>- But after spending some time
watching David's movers,</i>

00:39.252 --> 00:41.252
<i>I realized there might be
a simple solution</i>

00:41.252 --> 00:42.252
<i>to all of his problems.</i>

00:42.252 --> 00:45.252
<i>So I paid him a visit
to see if I could help.</i>

00:45.252 --> 00:46.412
Your movers are very in shape.

00:47.252 --> 00:48.412
- Our guys are in shape, yeah.

00:49.252 --> 00:51.252
- I mean, lifting
all those boxes and furniture.

00:51.252 --> 00:53.252
<i>That's a great way to get fit.</i>

00:53.252 --> 00:55.252
- Yeah, the guys are getting
a great workout.

00:55.252 --> 00:56.772
They're always getting
a great workout.

00:57.252 --> 00:58.252
<i>- And that's the idea.</i>

00:58.252 --> 01:00.252
<i>You see, the average
gym member in America</i>

01:00.252 --> 01:04.251
<i>spends over $700 a year
to perform physical labor</i>

01:04.251 --> 01:05.452
<i>that's very similar to the work</i>

01:05.471 --> 01:07.252
<i>that David's employees do.</i>

01:07.252 --> 01:09.252
<i>So if we can make
a convincing argument</i>

01:09.252 --> 01:11.252
<i>that moving boxes and furniture</i>

01:11.252 --> 01:13.252
<i>is a better workout
that going to the gym,</i>

01:13.252 --> 01:16.252
<i>David could tap into
an endless supply of labor</i>

01:16.252 --> 01:18.252
<i>that would actually pay him</i>

01:18.252 --> 01:20.252
<i>for the opportunity
to move stuff.</i>

01:27.252 --> 01:31.252
- People don't usually
pay to work...

01:31.252 --> 01:32.252
for somebody else.

01:32.252 --> 01:34.252
- I think you'll get
a lot more people

01:34.252 --> 01:35.572
if they just think
it's a workout,

01:35.592 --> 01:36.592
and we don't tell them

01:37.252 --> 01:39.252
that they're actually
doing free labor.

01:39.252 --> 01:40.412
<i>I mean, that's just my opinion</i>

01:40.432 --> 01:42.252
as someone who knows
a lot about marketing.

01:42.252 --> 01:43.252
<i>- I don't know.</i>

01:43.252 --> 01:45.252
I don't know
if I can convince people

01:45.252 --> 01:46.252
to do that.

01:47.252 --> 01:48.252
<i>- David was skeptical</i>

01:48.252 --> 01:49.452
<i>but agreed to give me a chance</i>

01:49.472 --> 01:51.252
<i>to prove that this would work.</i>

01:51.252 --> 01:52.612
<i>Launching a fitness craze,
however,</i>

01:52.632 --> 01:54.252
<i>would be no easy task.</i>

01:54.252 --> 01:56.252
<i>I didn't know much
about this stuff,</i>

01:56.252 --> 01:58.252
<i>but it seemed like
every popular workout</i>

01:58.252 --> 02:00.252
<i>was based on
a charismatic figure</i>

02:00.252 --> 02:03.252
<i>who's a living example
of what the workout can do.</i>

02:03.252 --> 02:04.252
<i>I know I'm charismatic,</i>

02:05.252 --> 02:07.252
<i>and since the workout
was my idea anyways,</i>

02:07.252 --> 02:10.252
<i>I thought it would be easiest
if I just did it.</i>

02:10.252 --> 02:12.252
<i>But after reviewing
the promotional images I took,</i>

02:13.252 --> 02:14.732
<i>I realized I just
didn't have the body</i>

02:14.752 --> 02:17.252
<i>to be a convincing
fitness authority.</i>

02:17.252 --> 02:20.252
<i>So I sent my producers
to a local fitness convention,</i>

02:20.252 --> 02:21.852
<i>and they found
a professional bodybuilder</i>

02:22.252 --> 02:24.252
<i>who seemed interested
in being a spokesperson.</i>

02:24.252 --> 02:26.252
<i>So later that week,
I brought him to my office</i>

02:26.252 --> 02:29.252
<i>to see if he could impress me
enough to get the job.</i>

02:29.252 --> 02:32.252
- I'm older, but watch me.

02:32.252 --> 02:33.252
Look at me.

02:33.252 --> 02:35.252
<i>I can outperform you.</i>

02:35.252 --> 02:39.252
I can... you know, I look
just as good as you do.

02:39.252 --> 02:43.252
I see this as an opportunity
really for me to teach.

02:43.252 --> 02:45.252
<i>- Jack said
all the right things,</i>

02:45.252 --> 02:47.252
<i>but what I really cared about
was his body.</i>

03:04.252 --> 03:05.252
<i>- Yeah, you've got...</i>

03:05.252 --> 03:06.532
seems like you've got
a good bod.

03:06.552 --> 03:08.252
- Thank you.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

03:08.252 --> 03:09.252
<i>Jack got the job.</i>

03:10.252 --> 03:12.372
<i>And because his role as
spokesman would be so crucial,</i>

03:12.392 --> 03:15.252
<i>I prepared an extensive
contract for him to sign.</i>

03:15.252 --> 03:16.332
In the event of your death,

03:16.352 --> 03:18.252
we have the rights
to your name, likeness.

03:18.252 --> 03:19.252
- Sure, sure.

03:19.252 --> 03:21.252
- DNA as well.
- <i>Okay.</i>

03:21.252 --> 03:22.252
- Is that...
are you comfortable with that?

03:22.252 --> 03:23.252
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

03:23.252 --> 03:24.252
- That's fine.

03:24.252 --> 03:25.252
<i>- With Jack on board,</i>

03:25.252 --> 03:26.452
<i>I walked him through my concept</i>

03:26.472 --> 03:28.472
<i>for a new workout called
The Movement</i>

03:29.252 --> 03:31.492
<i>that would consist entirely
of moving boxes and furniture</i>

03:31.752 --> 03:33.252
<i>from one location to another.</i>

03:33.252 --> 03:35.252
<i>My plan was to position Jack</i>

03:36.252 --> 03:38.252
<i>as the guru behind this workout</i>

03:38.252 --> 03:39.652
<i>in the hopes
I could convince people</i>

03:39.672 --> 03:41.252
<i>he got his amazing physique</i>

03:41.252 --> 03:43.252
<i>solely from lifting
household items.</i>

03:43.252 --> 03:46.252
Let's see some attitude.

03:46.252 --> 03:47.252
<i>Beautiful.</i>

03:47.252 --> 03:49.252
<i>And to really sell this idea,</i>

03:49.252 --> 03:51.252
<i>I hired an obese look-alike</i>

03:51.252 --> 03:54.252
<i>to pose as Jack
before he lost the weight.</i>

03:54.252 --> 03:56.252
<i>Now that The Movement
had its figurehead,</i>

03:56.252 --> 03:59.252
<i>I wanted to legitimize Jack
with his own book.</i>

03:59.252 --> 04:01.252
<i>So to get the job done quickly,</i>

04:01.252 --> 04:03.332
<i>I contacted a ghostwriter
who advertised his services</i>

04:03.352 --> 04:06.252
<i>on Craigslist
and invited him to my office</i>

04:06.252 --> 04:08.922
<i>to see if he was right
for the task.</i>

04:09.252 --> 04:10.932
- What I'm looking for
is someone who knows

04:10.952 --> 04:12.252
a lot about fitness.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.252
- Okay.
- <i>Is that you?</i>

04:14.252 --> 04:16.252
- Yes.

04:16.252 --> 04:17.692
- You know, for my own
due diligence,

04:18.252 --> 04:19.612
I need to know
you're a good writer

04:19.632 --> 04:21.252
before hiring you, obviously.

04:21.252 --> 04:23.252
- Yeah.

04:23.252 --> 04:25.452
- So can you come up with
an original sentence right now

04:25.472 --> 04:28.252
and tell it to me?

04:28.252 --> 04:29.252
- Um...

04:35.252 --> 04:36.252
Okay.

04:36.252 --> 04:39.252
Um, the candles flickered,
the sheets were still,

04:39.252 --> 04:43.252
but all the energy in the room
surrounded Roman and Kenzie.

04:43.252 --> 04:47.252
Kenzie stepped forth and...

04:47.252 --> 04:51.252
gently touched Roman's arm.

04:51.252 --> 04:53.412
He suddenly felt weak in
his legs and trembled and fell

04:53.432 --> 04:58.252
as if his Achilles heel
had been struck by a blade,

04:58.252 --> 05:02.252
but all it was
was simply a woman's touch.

05:02.252 --> 05:04.252
- Wow.

05:04.252 --> 05:05.252
That was a good sentence.

05:05.272 --> 05:07.252
- Thank you.

05:07.252 --> 05:09.252
- Obviously this book
would be more fitness, but...

05:09.252 --> 05:11.252
- Yeah.

05:11.252 --> 05:13.412
<i>- Austin seemed like a pretty
good fit for the project,</i>

05:13.432 --> 05:15.252
<i>so I gave him as much
information as I could</i>

05:15.252 --> 05:17.252
<i>about the workout
and its founder, Jack.</i>

05:18.252 --> 05:20.252
- What did he do
when he was younger?

05:20.252 --> 05:22.252
- As a child?
- Yeah.

05:22.252 --> 05:23.332
- Some things I don't know,

05:24.252 --> 05:26.532
and you're just gonna have
to fill in the blanks yourself.

05:26.552 --> 05:29.242
- Okay.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

05:29.252 --> 05:30.252
- All right then.

05:31.252 --> 05:32.252
<i>- With Austin off
to write the book,</i>

05:32.252 --> 05:34.252
<i>I had a cover designed,
highlighting the fact</i>

05:34.252 --> 05:35.382
<i>that Jack got his body</i>

05:36.252 --> 05:38.252
<i>only from moving
boxes and furniture</i>

05:38.252 --> 05:40.252
<i>and that he'd never been
to a gym in his life.</i>

05:41.252 --> 05:42.372
<i>The problem was, in reality,</i>

05:42.392 --> 05:44.392
<i>Jack goes to the gym
religiously.</i>

05:44.752 --> 05:47.252
- I'm in the gym
six to seven days a week.

05:47.252 --> 05:48.772
<i>- With The Movement
about to go public,</i>

05:49.252 --> 05:51.002
<i>I couldn't risk Jack
being seen at a gym,</i>

05:51.252 --> 05:53.252
<i>or else we'd be exposed
as a fraud.</i>

05:53.252 --> 05:55.252
<i>So I set up a private
workout space</i>

05:55.252 --> 05:58.252
<i>so he could maintain
his body in secret.</i>

05:58.252 --> 06:00.372
So you think this will work
to maintain those muscles?

06:01.252 --> 06:05.252
- If this is, you know,
what I have to do,

06:06.252 --> 06:08.252
uh, I can...
I'll make it work.

06:08.252 --> 06:10.252
- All right, well,
you gonna have a workout or...

06:10.252 --> 06:11.252
- Sure.

06:11.252 --> 06:13.252
- All right, uh...

06:15.252 --> 06:18.252
Have fun.

06:18.252 --> 06:19.452
<i>I felt confident moving forward</i>

06:19.472 --> 06:21.252
<i>now that our secret was safe,</i>

06:21.252 --> 06:23.252
<i>and I was thankful
that Jack was so committed</i>

06:23.252 --> 06:25.252
<i>to The Movement.</i>

06:25.252 --> 06:27.082
<i>And a couple days later,</i>

06:27.252 --> 06:29.252
<i>Austin returned
with the completed book.</i>

06:29.252 --> 06:31.252
Steve Jobs?

06:31.252 --> 06:33.252
- Yeah.

06:34.252 --> 06:38.252
I was one of his
childhood friends.

06:38.252 --> 06:40.252
- Oh, okay.

06:40.252 --> 06:41.492
<i>Austin had taken a few liberties</i>

06:41.512 --> 06:43.252
<i>with Jack's life story,</i>

06:43.252 --> 06:45.502
<i>but for my purposes
it would work.</i>

06:46.252 --> 06:47.772
<i>So I rushed published
a bunch of copies</i>

06:48.252 --> 06:50.332
<i>and mailed them to media
outlets throughout the state</i>

06:50.352 --> 06:52.252
<i>in the hopes
I'd get some interest.</i>

06:52.252 --> 06:54.252
<i>And as luck would have it,</i>

06:54.252 --> 06:56.252
<i>we soon got the big break
we needed.</i>

06:58.012 --> 06:59.912
- <i>So I have some exciting news.</i>
- Okay.

07:00.412 --> 07:03.412
- One of the most popular
morning news shows in the state

07:03.412 --> 07:06.412
wants you to talk about
The Movement

07:06.412 --> 07:09.412
live on air tomorrow morning.

07:09.412 --> 07:11.412
- Oh. Okay.

07:11.412 --> 07:12.412
Wow.

07:12.412 --> 07:13.412
- <i>How do you feel?</i>

07:13.412 --> 07:15.412
- I felt, uh...

07:15.412 --> 07:18.412
I felt like a...
I felt a rush go right by me.

07:19.412 --> 07:21.412
I mean, that is phenomenal.

07:21.412 --> 07:23.412
- Just so you know too.

07:23.412 --> 07:25.412
I gave them this book...
- <i>Okay.</i>

07:25.412 --> 07:27.412
- That I had ghostwritten
about your life.

07:27.412 --> 07:28.412
- Mm-kay.

07:28.412 --> 07:30.532
- Obviously the author
didn't know anything about you.

07:31.412 --> 07:32.412
- Right.

07:32.412 --> 07:33.692
<i>- So he kinda made
some stuff up.</i>

07:33.722 --> 07:34.422
- Okay.

07:34.412 --> 07:35.652
- It seems like a big part of it

07:35.652 --> 07:37.652
is how you were childhood
friends with Steve Jobs.

07:37.652 --> 07:40.412
So... do you know Steve Jobs?

07:40.412 --> 07:41.412
- Steve Jobs, yes.

07:41.412 --> 07:45.412
Uh, he... he's
the Microsoft...

07:45.412 --> 07:46.412
- Apple.
- Apple, right.

07:46.412 --> 07:47.412
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Yeah.

07:47.412 --> 07:49.412
- So anyways, yeah,
you might want to read it over

07:49.412 --> 07:51.652
to get a sense of what your
life is like before tomorrow.

07:51.682 --> 07:53.422
<i>- Okay, okay.</i>

07:53.412 --> 07:55.412
<i>- In the later chapters,
it actually says</i>

07:55.412 --> 07:56.812
you spend a lot of time
volunteering

07:57.412 --> 07:58.412
with jungle children.

07:58.412 --> 08:00.812
I don't know what that is, but
you might want to bring it up,

08:00.842 --> 08:02.422
because audiences love someone

08:02.412 --> 08:04.412
who gives back
and is charitable.

08:04.412 --> 08:05.412
- Okay, I'll be able to...

08:05.462 --> 08:08.422
I'll tell them, you know,
what they wanna hear.

08:08.412 --> 08:09.612
<i>You're watching</i>

08:10.412 --> 08:12.412
<i>San Diego 6 News
In the Morning.</i>

08:12.412 --> 08:13.412
- Welcome back.

08:13.412 --> 08:15.732
We are in spring, but we're
always looking ahead to summer.

08:15.732 --> 08:17.732
And if you're looking
to lose a couple of pounds,

08:17.732 --> 08:19.412
we have a free way to do it

08:19.412 --> 08:21.052
with things that are already
in your home,

08:21.412 --> 08:22.652
and we have proof that it works.

08:22.682 --> 08:24.422
- We're gonna
introduce you to someone.

08:24.412 --> 08:25.412
Come in here and look
at this before picture.

08:25.412 --> 08:27.412
This is Jack Garbarino before...

08:27.412 --> 08:29.412
This was Jack
about a hundred pounds ago.

08:29.412 --> 08:31.412
Now let's have you
the grand reveal.

08:31.412 --> 08:32.412
- <i>The big reveal.</i>

08:32.412 --> 08:33.491
- This is Jack now.
- Hello.

08:33.491 --> 08:34.812
- How great do you
look now, Jack?

08:34.842 --> 08:36.422
- I look great, I feel great.

08:36.412 --> 08:39.412
I feel a renewed person.

08:39.412 --> 08:42.412
I'm lean and mean,
and I'm a fighting machine.

08:42.412 --> 08:44.532
<i>The news appearance
couldn't have gone better.</i>

08:44.562 --> 08:46.422
<i>And over the next couple weeks,</i>

08:46.412 --> 08:48.412
<i>Jack made appearances
on morning shows</i>

08:48.412 --> 08:49.412
<i>throughout the region.</i>

08:49.412 --> 08:53.412
<i>- Our next guest lost more
than one hundred pounds</i>

08:53.412 --> 08:55.412
<i>and never stepped foot in a gym.</i>

08:55.412 --> 08:56.612
- Can you lose a hundred pounds

08:57.212 --> 08:58.572
just by moving boxes
and furniture?

08:58.592 --> 09:00.412
<i>One guy says it's possible.</i>

09:00.412 --> 09:02.412
- Look at this man,
he lost over a hundred pounds,

09:02.412 --> 09:06.412
<i>and now he's sharing his
fitness tips with all of us.</i>

09:06.412 --> 09:07.452
- Jack...
- Good to be here.

09:07.482 --> 09:08.722
- You're a story of inspiration.

09:09.412 --> 09:11.412
- Yes, um...
Yeah, that was me.

09:11.412 --> 09:15.412
I mean, you can see
that I was a fat tub of lard.

09:15.412 --> 09:17.412
And, uh...

09:17.412 --> 09:18.692
- 'Cause you can say it.
I can't.

09:18.722 --> 09:21.422
- And you also
came across Steve Jobs.

09:21.412 --> 09:23.412
- Yes.
- How did you meet him?

09:23.412 --> 09:24.892
- Well, I grew up with him
as a child.

09:24.892 --> 09:25.892
- No kidding.

09:25.892 --> 09:28.412
- He was my best friend
as a child.

09:28.412 --> 09:30.572
- Were you able to keep
that friendship with Steve Jobs

09:30.602 --> 09:33.002
so he could see what you were
motivated to eventually become?

09:33.412 --> 09:35.412
- You know, he never saw me
really at this fit.

09:35.412 --> 09:36.412
We kept in touch, but...

09:36.412 --> 09:38.412
That's it, simple as this.

09:38.412 --> 09:39.412
I do work, charity work...

09:39.442 --> 09:40.422
- Okay.

09:40.412 --> 09:41.412
- With jungle children.

09:42.412 --> 09:43.412
- Jungle child is what?

09:43.412 --> 09:44.732
Yeah, jungle children
are children

09:44.762 --> 09:46.422
that live in the jungle.

09:46.412 --> 09:48.412
A while ago I was working
with a jungle child.

09:48.412 --> 09:50.412
His name was Dendy.

09:50.412 --> 09:52.412
He was a great
inspiration for me.

09:52.412 --> 09:55.412
And unfortunately,
tragically he died

09:55.412 --> 09:58.412
when baboons kidnapped
and ate him.

09:58.412 --> 10:01.412
It was actually
one of the worst days

10:01.412 --> 10:02.412
of my life.

10:02.412 --> 10:03.412
- Where is this?

10:03.412 --> 10:04.532
<i>Jack turned out to be</i>

10:04.562 --> 10:06.422
<i>an extremely compelling
spokesman,</i>

10:06.412 --> 10:08.412
<i>and he was really hitting
our message home.</i>

10:08.412 --> 10:12.412
- In my opinion, gym stands for
"giving your money away."

10:12.412 --> 10:13.612
Never been to a gym in my life.

10:13.642 --> 10:16.422
Never stepped foot in the gym
in my entire life.

10:16.412 --> 10:20.412
I got this body by simply
just moving boxes and furniture.

10:20.412 --> 10:22.412
If I could do it,
anybody else could do it.

10:22.412 --> 10:25.412
Sign up and you can see
what we're doing

10:25.412 --> 10:26.732
to help people
around the country.

10:26.762 --> 10:27.922
- Good work.
You look amazing.

10:28.412 --> 10:30.412
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.

10:30.412 --> 10:31.412
- <i>And before long,</i>

10:31.412 --> 10:34.082
<i>the movement inbox
was flooded with requests</i>

10:34.412 --> 10:36.412
<i>from people wanting
to try the workout.</i>

10:36.412 --> 10:38.412
<i>So I returned to City of Angels</i>

10:38.412 --> 10:41.372
<i>and convinced David
to let us do our first workout</i>

10:41.412 --> 10:43.412
<i>on one of his upcoming
moving jobs.</i>

10:43.412 --> 10:46.412
<i>With an opportunity
to finally prove my concept,</i>

10:46.412 --> 10:47.412
<i>I was excited,</i>

10:47.412 --> 10:50.412
<i>but that's when I made
a troubling discovery.</i>

10:50.412 --> 10:51.772
<i>When I stopped by
the storage unit,</i>

10:51.802 --> 10:54.422
<i>I noticed that none of
the water we had left for Jack</i>

10:54.412 --> 10:55.412
<i>had been touched.</i>

10:55.412 --> 10:58.412
<i>At first, I thought he might
just be bringing his own water,</i>

10:58.412 --> 11:01.412
<i>but when I had the clerk
check the gate access records,</i>

11:01.412 --> 11:03.412
<i>I realized he might
not have been going</i>

11:03.412 --> 11:04.452
<i>to his private gym at all.</i>

11:05.412 --> 11:06.412
- I don't see any...

11:06.412 --> 11:10.412
any report that shows
it was accessed.

11:10.412 --> 11:11.412
<i>- This wasn't good.</i>

11:11.412 --> 11:12.412
<i>I have major trust issues</i>

11:12.442 --> 11:14.422
<i>stemming from
a non-sexual incident</i>

11:14.412 --> 11:16.412
<i>that happened
when I was a child,</i>

11:16.412 --> 11:18.412
<i>so I didn't know
if I was just being paranoid.</i>

11:18.412 --> 11:20.412
<i>But if Jack was still
going to his old gym</i>

11:20.412 --> 11:23.412
<i>after saying otherwise
to an audience of millions,</i>

11:23.412 --> 11:25.412
<i>the credibility
of our entire workout</i>

11:25.412 --> 11:26.412
<i>would be shattered.</i>

11:26.412 --> 11:29.412
- Never stepped foot in a gym
in my entire life.

11:30.412 --> 11:31.972
<i>I couldn't risk
letting this guy</i>

11:32.002 --> 11:34.382
<i>destroy everything
I had created,</i>

11:34.412 --> 11:36.412
<i>so I paid a visit
to a private investigator</i>

11:36.412 --> 11:37.452
<i>I'd worked with in the past</i>

11:37.482 --> 11:40.422
<i>to help me find out if Jack
was honoring our agreement.</i>

11:40.412 --> 11:43.412
<i>I want you to help me
keep tabs on a fitness model</i>

11:44.412 --> 11:45.412
<i>that I'm working with.</i>

11:45.412 --> 11:47.412
- Okay.
Male or female?

11:47.412 --> 11:49.412
- Male.
- <i>Male, okay.</i>

11:49.412 --> 11:50.492
- <i>I wanted to stay on task,</i>

11:50.522 --> 11:52.422
<i>but the conversation
got sidetracked</i>

11:52.412 --> 11:55.412
<i>as Brian started bragging
that he too was a model,</i>

11:55.412 --> 11:57.012
<i>who had appeared
in a couple of magazines</i>

11:57.042 --> 11:58.042
<i>in the '80s.</i>

11:58.412 --> 11:59.412
- And then all of a sudden,

11:59.412 --> 12:00.412
it just went from that magazine
to that magazine and...

12:00.412 --> 12:02.412
- What magazine?
<i>- It was "Penthouse Magazine."</i>

12:02.412 --> 12:04.412
- Oh, "Penthouse," sorry.
- Yeah, years ago.

12:04.412 --> 12:05.412
Years, years, years ago.

12:05.412 --> 12:07.412
- "Penthouse" is porn.
- <i>It's not.</i>

12:07.412 --> 12:09.412
Only time is when
he's taking photos of you.

12:09.412 --> 12:10.932
<i>You know, you're with
a gorgeous woman.</i>

12:10.962 --> 12:12.122
- So you're fully nude in it?

12:12.412 --> 12:14.412
- Nah, can't really see much.

12:14.412 --> 12:15.412
- But you're penetrating?

12:15.442 --> 12:17.422
- Penetrating, you can't see.

12:17.412 --> 12:18.852
- That's porn, right?
<i>- No, it's not.</i>

12:18.852 --> 12:20.132
Not even close
to being porn, no.

12:20.162 --> 12:22.422
<i>All it is, is just
being a male model</i>

12:22.412 --> 12:24.412
and taking photographs of you
with another woman,

12:25.412 --> 12:27.412
very tasteful,
very professional, nothing.

12:27.412 --> 12:29.412
- But your...
your penis was erect.

12:29.412 --> 12:30.412
- Yeah, of course it was.

12:30.442 --> 12:32.422
When you got
a nice-looking girl...

12:32.412 --> 12:34.172
- And you're naked.
- And you're naked, yeah.

12:34.412 --> 12:35.412
- But what do you call that?

12:35.412 --> 12:36.412
<i>- What do you mean,
what do you call that?</i>

12:36.412 --> 12:37.412
- That type of modeling.

12:37.412 --> 12:41.412
- Um... entertainment.

12:41.412 --> 12:43.412
You know, adult
entertainment modeling.

12:43.412 --> 12:45.412
- Okay.

12:45.412 --> 12:47.412
<i>Once Brian was
finished bragging,</i>

12:47.412 --> 12:49.412
<i>I filled him in
on my suspicions about Jack.</i>

12:49.412 --> 12:51.412
He says he works out
every day, so if he's going...

12:51.412 --> 12:53.612
- Obviously he has to work out
to get that kind of body.

12:53.642 --> 12:56.422
<i>- Brian agreed that
something wasn't adding up</i>

12:56.412 --> 12:58.412
<i>and recommending
a covert surveillance.</i>

12:58.412 --> 13:00.412
<i>So early the next morning,</i>

13:00.412 --> 13:02.412
<i>he picked me up
in a Best Buy parking lot.</i>

13:02.412 --> 13:03.412
- Let's do it.

13:03.412 --> 13:04.772
<i>- And we headed
to the neighborhood</i>

13:05.412 --> 13:06.412
<i>where Jack lives,</i>

13:06.412 --> 13:08.412
<i>parking just down the street
from his home.</i>

13:08.412 --> 13:09.492
- We just sit here and wait.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.422
That's what we do.

13:11.412 --> 13:13.412
<i>- After two hours of waiting,</i>

13:13.412 --> 13:15.412
<i>Jack still hadn't emerged,</i>

13:15.412 --> 13:17.412
<i>but I was determined
to stick this out</i>

13:17.412 --> 13:19.412
<i>as long as it takes.</i>

13:26.412 --> 13:27.412
That's a woman.

13:27.412 --> 13:29.412
- Yep.

13:31.412 --> 13:32.412
It's not porn.

13:33.412 --> 13:35.412
- "Penthouse"?
- No, it's not porn.

13:35.412 --> 13:36.412
- I think it is porn.

13:36.412 --> 13:40.412
- Porn is when you're having
intercourse or fellatio,

13:40.412 --> 13:42.412
one of the two.

13:42.412 --> 13:44.412
- But you were with a woman.

13:44.412 --> 13:45.412
- Yes.

13:45.412 --> 13:47.412
- And so that means
you did porn.

13:47.412 --> 13:49.412
- No penetration.

13:54.412 --> 13:55.972
I just wish I waited
a little bit longer

13:56.002 --> 13:58.002
till the kids
got a little bit older.

14:00.412 --> 14:01.412
- Why?

14:01.412 --> 14:02.412
- 'Cause divorce is...

14:02.412 --> 14:04.412
'cause the kids were young
and they were...

14:04.412 --> 14:06.412
One was out of high school
and going to college,

14:06.412 --> 14:08.412
and the other two
were in high school.

14:08.412 --> 14:10.412
I just wish that the little one

14:10.412 --> 14:12.412
was out of high school.

14:12.412 --> 14:15.412
Some people, you know,
don't want to wait it out,

14:15.412 --> 14:16.532
'cause they figure, you know,

14:16.562 --> 14:18.562
they're wasting five years
of their own life.

14:18.752 --> 14:22.422
"I need to get out."

14:22.412 --> 14:25.412
We do too much for our children.

14:26.412 --> 14:27.572
<i>- After five hours of waiting,</i>

14:27.602 --> 14:29.422
<i>I was about ready to give up,</i>

14:29.412 --> 14:31.412
<i>but then Jack finally emerged.</i>

14:31.412 --> 14:32.412
<i>That's him.</i>

14:32.412 --> 14:33.412
<i>Let's go.</i>

14:33.412 --> 14:34.412
Put your glasses on.

14:34.412 --> 14:36.412
<i>Okay, let's do it.</i>

14:36.412 --> 14:37.612
We're on a code five right now.

14:37.642 --> 14:39.422
It's called a code five,
mobile surveillance.

14:41.412 --> 14:43.412
There he is.
- Right turn.

14:43.412 --> 14:44.412
- I see him.
Good job.

14:44.412 --> 14:45.412
<i>Lone Hill Ave.</i>

14:46.412 --> 14:48.412
<i>After making
a quick stop at a drug store,</i>

14:48.412 --> 14:50.412
<i>I was hopeful he would
just be heading back home,</i>

14:50.412 --> 14:54.412
<i>but unfortunately, Jack
had something else in mind.</i>

14:54.412 --> 14:56.252
- This is where he's going.
- Wait, wait, wait.

14:56.282 --> 14:57.422
<i>Crunch Fitness.</i>

14:57.412 --> 14:58.412
<i>This wasn't good.</i>

14:58.412 --> 15:00.412
<i>Clearly Jack wasn't taking
our business arrangement</i>

15:00.442 --> 15:02.422
<i>as seriously as I had hoped.</i>

15:02.412 --> 15:04.412
- The guy lied to you.

15:04.412 --> 15:06.412
He has no respect for you.

15:06.612 --> 15:07.212
None.

15:08.612 --> 15:10.892
<i>I was shocked
to discover</i>

15:10.892 --> 15:12.572
<i>that Jack had been going
to his regular gym</i>

15:12.602 --> 15:13.612
<i>behind my back.</i>

15:13.612 --> 15:15.612
<i>This had to be dealt with quick.</i>

15:15.612 --> 15:17.812
<i>So the next day, I had him
meet me at the storage locker</i>

15:17.842 --> 15:19.612
<i>to confront him about
what I saw.</i>

15:19.612 --> 15:22.612
So, uh, how's our secret gym
been working out for you?

15:22.612 --> 15:24.612
- It's working out okay, yeah.

15:25.612 --> 15:26.772
<i>It gets a little hot in there.</i>

15:26.802 --> 15:28.612
Gotta get the workout
and come out...

15:28.612 --> 15:31.612
you know, come out
nice and drenched.

15:31.612 --> 15:34.612
- Mm-hmm.

15:34.612 --> 15:37.612
Look, Jack, I know
you haven't been coming here.

15:37.612 --> 15:39.612
I know you're still going
to your regular gym.

15:39.612 --> 15:42.612
- Mm-hmm, mm-kay.

15:42.612 --> 15:43.782
- Is that true?

15:44.612 --> 15:45.612
- Yes.

15:45.612 --> 15:46.892
<i>- With his back
against the wall,</i>

15:46.922 --> 15:49.612
<i>Jack admitted that the storage
unit didn't work for him.</i>

15:49.612 --> 15:52.612
- I... I can't get
a good full workout

15:52.612 --> 15:55.612
in this... this gym.

15:55.612 --> 15:56.932
<i>- Fortunately,
I had come prepared</i>

15:56.932 --> 15:58.922
<i>with a compromise that would
allow him to work out</i>

15:58.932 --> 16:00.602
<i>at any gym he wanted.</i>

16:00.612 --> 16:02.692
The way I see it, the only way
you can go to your gym

16:02.722 --> 16:04.612
is in disguise.
- <i>Okay.</i>

16:04.612 --> 16:07.612
- So do you think this is
something that can work for you?

16:07.612 --> 16:09.612
- Yes, I'll...

16:09.612 --> 16:11.612
I can put it to work.

16:11.612 --> 16:13.612
- <i>Everybody was happy.</i>

16:13.612 --> 16:15.812
<i>And after telling Jack that
I'd be secretly watching him</i>

16:16.612 --> 16:17.612
<i>for the next six months,</i>

16:17.612 --> 16:19.772
<i>I could now be confident
that he'd stick with the plan,</i>

16:19.802 --> 16:22.612
<i>and our secret would be safe.</i>

16:22.612 --> 16:23.612
- Thank you.

16:23.612 --> 16:24.612
<i>- With Jack back in line,</i>

16:25.612 --> 16:27.812
<i>I reached out to our list
of eager Movement participants</i>

16:28.612 --> 16:30.612
<i>and booked three of them
for what I described</i>

16:30.612 --> 16:32.612
<i>as a free workout intensive.</i>

16:32.612 --> 16:35.612
<i>But in reality,
these people were showing up</i>

16:35.612 --> 16:37.612
<i>for the real moving job
I had scheduled with David.</i>

16:37.642 --> 16:40.612
Hey, everyone.

16:40.612 --> 16:42.612
So I'm gonna start by asking
y'all a question.

16:42.612 --> 16:44.612
Are you guy ready
to change your life

16:44.612 --> 16:46.612
with The Movement workout?

16:46.612 --> 16:47.612
- Yeah.

16:47.612 --> 16:49.612
<i>- And what better way
to pump them up</i>

16:49.612 --> 16:52.612
<i>than with an inspirational
speech from Jack?</i>

16:52.612 --> 16:53.772
- I lost over a hundred pounds

16:54.612 --> 16:57.612
just by moving
boxes and furniture.

16:57.612 --> 16:59.612
If I could do it,
you could do it.

16:59.612 --> 17:01.612
Now let's get started
and let's start moving.

17:04.612 --> 17:05.612
- Great.

17:05.612 --> 17:06.811
- That was good, that was good.

17:07.452 --> 17:08.612
- Thank you, Jack.
- Thank you, thank you.

17:08.612 --> 17:10.172
- You're truly
an inspiration to us all.

17:10.202 --> 17:11.202
- Pleasure, thank you.

17:11.612 --> 17:12.612
- All right.

17:12.612 --> 17:16.612
<i>Now that Jack had inspired
and energized the group,</i>

17:16.612 --> 17:19.612
<i>I handed each of them their
matching team workout wear</i>

17:19.612 --> 17:20.811
<i>and headed to the client's home</i>

17:21.612 --> 17:23.612
<i>to have him fill out
the necessary paperwork.</i>

17:23.612 --> 17:26.612
<i>Now it was finally time
to see if these three strangers</i>

17:26.612 --> 17:29.612
<i>would complete
an entire moving job for free.</i>

17:30.032 --> 17:33.612
What you'll be getting today
is a full-body workout.

17:33.612 --> 17:37.612
So in this house, I've prepared
a bunch of furniture and boxes

17:37.612 --> 17:38.852
for you to move into this truck.

17:39.612 --> 17:40.612
<i>Got it?</i>

17:40.612 --> 17:41.612
- Are we timed on this?

17:41.612 --> 17:43.612
Is there a certain
time limitation?

17:43.612 --> 17:45.612
- The goal is to move
as fast as you can,

17:45.612 --> 17:47.612
because we want
a cardio workout too.

17:47.612 --> 17:48.612
- Mm, okay.

17:48.612 --> 17:50.612
- <i>And with that, they began.</i>

17:50.612 --> 17:51.812
- Whoa, there's a lot of stuff.

17:51.842 --> 17:52.612
- Nice.

17:52.612 --> 17:53.612
- <i>To be honest,</i>

17:54.612 --> 17:55.852
<i>I had my doubts going into this,</i>

17:55.882 --> 17:57.612
<i>but not only were they</i>

17:57.612 --> 17:59.092
<i>efficiently moving
the client's stuff,</i>

17:59.612 --> 18:01.612
<i>to my surprise,
the group actually seemed</i>

18:01.612 --> 18:03.612
<i>to be enjoying their workout.</i>

18:03.612 --> 18:05.252
- I mean, I've helped
friends move before,

18:05.612 --> 18:07.612
but I never thought of it
as a workout.

18:07.612 --> 18:09.242
- So if you go like this,
you'll get a bicep workout

18:09.612 --> 18:10.612
if you do curls.
- Right, right.

18:10.612 --> 18:11.612
- Do you feel that here?

18:11.612 --> 18:12.612
- Yeah, I do.
- Yeah.

18:12.612 --> 18:13.612
<i>It became clear</i>

18:13.612 --> 18:15.612
<i>they had all
bought into the dream</i>

18:15.612 --> 18:17.612
<i>that Jack was selling.</i>

18:17.612 --> 18:19.612
<i>And after only 2 1/2 hours,</i>

18:19.612 --> 18:21.612
<i>the truck was all loaded up.</i>

18:21.612 --> 18:23.612
<i>It was a bit of
a challenge to explain</i>

18:23.612 --> 18:26.612
<i>why we needed to go to
a second house to unload.</i>

18:26.612 --> 18:27.612
We're halfway there,

18:27.612 --> 18:29.612
but this next part
is the most crucial part

18:29.612 --> 18:32.612
because your muscles
are training during exhaustion.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.612
<i>But it seemed like
their faith in Jack's workout</i>

18:34.612 --> 18:37.612
<i>gave them the will
to keep going.</i>

18:37.612 --> 18:38.612
There she goes.

18:38.612 --> 18:42.612
<i>It took five full hours
to complete the move,</i>

18:42.612 --> 18:44.612
<i>but these people did it
without ever thinking</i>

18:44.612 --> 18:45.612
<i>it was actual labor.</i>

18:46.402 --> 18:48.122
<i>And with everything
unloaded from the truck,</i>

18:48.152 --> 18:51.612
<i>I congratulated my team on
finishing their first workout</i>

18:51.612 --> 18:53.612
<i>and sent them off.</i>

18:55.002 --> 18:57.202
<i>The moving job
was complete,</i>

18:57.362 --> 18:59.682
<i>and even though the homeowner
had a few minor complaints...</i>

18:59.712 --> 19:01.802
- The way they handled
the boxes and stuff,

19:01.802 --> 19:03.802
I said,
they're not professional.

19:03.802 --> 19:05.162
- Well, I appreciate
that feedback.

19:05.802 --> 19:06.922
I think that's really smart.

19:06.942 --> 19:08.802
<i>He eventually agreed
to sign off on the job.</i>

19:08.802 --> 19:10.402
- I'm not trying
to give you a hard time.

19:10.802 --> 19:11.802
- No, it's okay.

19:11.802 --> 19:13.802
Everyone has a different
personality.

19:13.802 --> 19:16.802
<i>And that meant my concept
was a success.</i>

19:16.802 --> 19:18.802
<i>So the next day,
I returned to David</i>

19:18.802 --> 19:20.802
<i>to introduce him
to the only employee</i>

19:20.802 --> 19:21.802
<i>he'll ever need.</i>

19:21.802 --> 19:23.802
This is Jack Garbarino.

19:23.802 --> 19:25.802
- Hey, Jack. I'm David.
- Hi, pleasure to meet you.

19:25.802 --> 19:27.322
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

19:27.342 --> 19:29.792
- And it's his hard work
and dedication

19:29.802 --> 19:31.802
that really made
this workout happen.

19:31.802 --> 19:32.802
- Okay.

19:32.802 --> 19:34.802
- So anytime you need
new movers...

19:34.802 --> 19:35.802
<i>- Okay.</i>

19:35.802 --> 19:36.842
- Jack can go on the news,

19:36.862 --> 19:38.802
lie to everyone in America,

19:38.802 --> 19:40.802
and you'll get
a fresh batch of people

19:40.802 --> 19:42.802
ready to move houses for free.

19:42.802 --> 19:44.802
- That's great.
- Yeah.

19:44.802 --> 19:46.802
- Thanks.
Yeah, ready to roll.

19:46.802 --> 19:48.802
- All right, well,
I'll leave you two

19:48.802 --> 19:50.802
to take it from here.

19:50.802 --> 19:51.802
- Thank you.

19:51.802 --> 19:53.802
- All right.

19:53.802 --> 19:56.802
- Yeah, so, um,
you're my new boss.

19:57.802 --> 19:59.802
So my job is to be
out there to promote.

19:59.802 --> 20:04.802
I can do news broadcasts
and be out in the public.

20:04.802 --> 20:09.182
I can do, you know,
seminars or, uh...

20:09.802 --> 20:10.922
You know, I know Steve Jobs.

20:10.942 --> 20:12.802
He, you know, he passed away,

20:12.802 --> 20:15.802
founder of Apple.

20:15.802 --> 20:17.802
<i>- I was happy that David
now had the free labor</i>

20:17.802 --> 20:18.802
<i>he'd always wanted.</i>

20:18.802 --> 20:20.802
<i>And knowing that Jack
was holding up</i>

20:20.802 --> 20:22.802
<i>his end of the bargain,</i>

20:22.802 --> 20:24.442
<i>I could be sure
that The Movement's future</i>

20:24.802 --> 20:25.802
<i>was secure.</i>

20:25.802 --> 20:27.122
<i>But there was still
one more thing</i>

20:27.142 --> 20:28.802
<i>that I had to take care of.</i>

20:28.802 --> 20:32.802
I just pulled up the dictionary
definition of pornography.

20:32.802 --> 20:34.802
"Printed or visual material

20:34.802 --> 20:37.802
"containing the explicit
description or display

20:37.802 --> 20:41.802
of sexual organs
or activity."

20:41.802 --> 20:43.002
- You just Googled this, right?

20:43.022 --> 20:44.802
- Yeah, that's
the dictionary definition.

20:44.802 --> 20:46.802
- "Printed or visual..."

20:46.802 --> 20:49.802
Okay, it was printed, for sure.

20:49.802 --> 20:52.802
No wonder why my parents
were [bleep] so mad at me.

20:54.802 --> 20:55.802
Hmm.

21:00.292 --> 21:02.092
- "I have never been
to a gym in my life."

21:02.092 --> 21:05.092
- I have never been
to a gym before.

21:05.092 --> 21:06.092
- "Never in my life."

21:06.092 --> 21:07.092
- Never in my life.

21:07.092 --> 21:08.592
- "I haven't even
walked in the door

21:08.592 --> 21:09.592
to look around."

21:09.592 --> 21:12.592
- I haven't even walked
in the door to look around.
