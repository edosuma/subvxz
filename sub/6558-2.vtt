01:38.891 --> 01:41.185
Here it is, gang.
Rocky Point Beach.

01:41.352 --> 01:43.604
What a groovy spot
for a beach party.

01:43.771 --> 01:46.274
Yeah, man.
I can already taste...

01:46.440 --> 01:48.776
those chocolate-covered
hot dogs.

01:48.943 --> 01:52.405
Yuck! His stomach must be
made of scrap iron.

01:52.571 --> 01:55.408
Can I help it if my first toy
was a garbage disposal?

01:55.574 --> 01:57.785
Come on, gang.
Let's unload.

01:57.952 --> 01:59.287
- All right.
- Okay.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.122
I'll give Daphne the boxes.

02:01.289 --> 02:02.790
Hurry up!

02:10.798 --> 02:13.634
Hey, like, where's Scooby-Doo?

02:13.801 --> 02:15.344
He's supposed to be helping me.

02:15.511 --> 02:16.804
He went surfing.

02:17.305 --> 02:19.265
Scooby-Doo!

02:44.415 --> 02:47.918
Okay! Come and get it!

02:48.919 --> 02:50.046
Oh, no!

02:57.511 --> 02:59.430
Hey, what's with Scooby-Doo?

03:05.644 --> 03:09.190
Zoinks!
A seagoing ghost!

03:12.943 --> 03:14.612
Shaggy, come back!

03:18.240 --> 03:20.493
Shaggy, come out
of that umbrella.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.288
No. Uh-uh.

03:24.455 --> 03:25.956
Did you see what I saw?

03:26.123 --> 03:27.583
Yeah, we saw it...

03:27.750 --> 03:29.960
and we're going back
to find out what it was.

03:30.127 --> 03:32.046
Swell. I'll wait here.

03:32.213 --> 03:34.298
And when you find out,
send me a telegram.

03:34.465 --> 03:36.801
We won't have to.
Look! It's gone!

03:40.513 --> 03:41.972
Whew-ee!

03:42.264 --> 03:46.018
There's something mighty spooky
going on around here.

03:46.435 --> 03:49.980
Yeah, and I wonder what it is.

03:54.151 --> 03:55.986
Hey, gang, listen to this.

03:56.153 --> 03:59.115
"Another Boat Mysteriously Vanishes.

03:59.281 --> 04:02.952
Sheriff and Coast Guard are baffled by
the mysterious disappearances."

04:03.119 --> 04:06.038
"Beach hermit Ebenezer Shark...

04:06.205 --> 04:10.251
claims it was the ghost
of Captain Cutler who stole it."

04:10.418 --> 04:12.002
- Ghost?
- Ghost?

04:12.169 --> 04:15.131
Do you think that's what
we saw last night?

04:15.297 --> 04:18.717
I don't know, but maybe
that beach hermit Ebenezer Shark...

04:18.926 --> 04:20.177
can give us a clue.

04:20.594 --> 04:23.722
Then let's pay him a visit tonight.

04:36.110 --> 04:39.738
Aye! I seen him
with me very own eyes.

04:40.072 --> 04:45.661
A ghostly glow moving through the fog
just before the boats vanish.

04:46.036 --> 04:49.081
But what makes you think
it was the ghost of Captain Cutler?

04:49.415 --> 04:52.710
Because it was on
a foggy night such as this...

04:52.877 --> 04:55.087
that Captain Cutler's boat
was wrecked.

04:55.463 --> 04:59.258
It collided with one of them
fancy yachts from the marina...

04:59.425 --> 05:02.845
sending Cutler down
to the graveyard of ships.

05:03.012 --> 05:04.054
Huh?

05:04.430 --> 05:07.433
But before he disappeared
into the sea...

05:07.600 --> 05:09.935
he shouted that he would return.

05:10.102 --> 05:13.105
So by causing the yachts
to vanish from the marina...

05:13.272 --> 05:16.400
- Cutler's getting his revenge.
- Aye.

05:16.567 --> 05:17.943
Huh?

05:39.089 --> 05:40.758
Hey, it's Scooby!

05:40.925 --> 05:42.801
Come on!

05:43.594 --> 05:46.013
Zoinks!
It's that ghost again!

05:50.684 --> 05:53.812
That's no ghost!
It's just Scooby-Doo!

05:54.396 --> 05:57.650
It looks like your pooch
found me old diving suit.

05:57.816 --> 05:59.276
Diving suit?

05:59.443 --> 06:03.280
Aye. Now, if you want to know
any more about Cutler...

06:03.447 --> 06:07.284
I think you'd better see his wife
up at the old lighthouse.

06:08.536 --> 06:12.248
There's something mighty fishy
about Ebenezer Shark.

06:12.414 --> 06:13.541
I'll say there is.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.835
Yeah. He looks more like a barracuda.

06:20.297 --> 06:23.801
Listen, Daph and I will stick around here
and keep an eye on old Shark.

06:23.968 --> 06:26.804
You three 90 up to the old lighthouse
and talk to Widow Cutler.

06:26.971 --> 06:30.057
- Old lighthouse?
- Yeah, old lighthouse.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.317
What a creepy-looking lighthouse.

06:40.484 --> 06:42.653
Okay, Scooby. Go knock on the door.

06:42.820 --> 06:44.488
Right.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.038
Look at him. What a ham.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.710
I guess it's up to you, Velma.

06:57.876 --> 07:01.338
It's up to all of us. Now, march!

07:01.922 --> 07:03.924
Ladies first.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.221
Well, come on!

07:11.724 --> 07:13.100
WOW!

07:13.267 --> 07:16.228
Like, this place is furnished
in early Halloween.

07:17.938 --> 07:21.900
It's obvious. She practices witchcraft.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.570
Hey, look at these.

07:24.737 --> 07:25.988
What zoinky labels.

07:26.155 --> 07:28.490
"Ear of a newt"?

07:28.657 --> 07:30.075
Hey, what's this?

07:30.492 --> 07:33.537
That? Oh, that's canned hyena laughs.

07:41.629 --> 07:44.673
<i>Look. Witchcraft Made Easy.</i>

07:44.882 --> 07:47.259
Very interesting.

07:48.135 --> 07:51.972
Velma, who do I know
with long, skinny hands?

07:53.015 --> 07:56.602
- Good evening.
- Zoinks!

07:59.521 --> 08:01.440
Mrs. Cutler, I presume?

08:01.607 --> 08:06.278
Aye. I was just tending the light
and didn't hear you knock.

08:06.445 --> 08:09.365
Now, what's your problem?

08:09.531 --> 08:11.283
It's about Captain Cutler.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.577
We think we saw his ghost.

08:13.744 --> 08:15.162
You did, dearie.

08:15.621 --> 08:17.956
It was me and my witchcraft...

08:18.123 --> 08:23.337
that brought Captain Cutler back
from his watery grave.

08:24.129 --> 08:27.216
Then it's his ghost
that's making these yachts vanish?

08:27.383 --> 08:31.679
Aye. But had I known
he'd take his revenge...

08:31.845 --> 08:35.224
I'd have left him under the sea.

08:41.021 --> 08:43.857
Yum, yum, yum. Oh, boy!

08:44.024 --> 08:46.944
Yum, yum, yum. That's good!

08:47.152 --> 08:48.153
Huh?

08:48.696 --> 08:51.448
You'll pardon me
doing the wash, dearie.

08:51.990 --> 08:54.410
Yuck! Blech!

08:54.910 --> 08:58.163
Well, we have to go now.
Thanks for your help.

08:58.664 --> 09:03.001
Anytime, dearie.
Anytime.

09:07.172 --> 09:10.426
Whew! Am I glad to get
out of that scary pad.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.010
Me too. Yuck!

09:12.428 --> 09:16.265
Now, our next step is to find the ghost.

09:16.432 --> 09:19.518
I think he's found us.
Look!

09:24.690 --> 09:27.776
Come on!
After that glow!

09:29.027 --> 09:30.404
It's in that drainpipe.

09:32.531 --> 09:35.367
Well, it got away, so let's go.

09:35.534 --> 09:36.785
Come here!

09:37.411 --> 09:38.912
Scooby will go in after it.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.664
Oh, that's different.

09:41.874 --> 09:43.834
- Yes, you.

09:44.209 --> 09:47.171
You're the only one that can
squeeze into that drainpipe.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.093
Uh-uh. Too fat.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.762
Too fat?

09:58.098 --> 10:00.392
Would you squeeze in
for a Scooby Snack?

10:00.559 --> 10:04.563
Uh-uh. Uh-uh! Uh-uh.

10:04.730 --> 10:07.065
Uh-huh.

10:10.736 --> 10:13.655
Scooby-Doo!

10:31.965 --> 10:35.010
Like, wow!
Glowing seaweed!

10:35.177 --> 10:37.888
It looks like you found a clue,
Scooby-Doo.

10:38.180 --> 10:40.766
Well, Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

10:42.267 --> 10:43.435
Did you find anything?

10:43.852 --> 10:46.230
Here <i>it is.
Phosphorum pyrifora.</i>

10:46.396 --> 10:47.940
Like, speak English.

10:48.106 --> 10:50.234
A phosphorus-glowing seaweed...

10:50.400 --> 10:54.947
found only in the area known
as the "graveyard of ships."

10:55.405 --> 10:57.908
That's where Captain Cutler went down.

10:58.242 --> 11:00.619
Then maybe that's where
we'll find his ghost...

11:00.786 --> 11:02.496
and the answer to our mystery.

11:02.746 --> 11:04.998
But what about Ebenezer Shark?

11:05.165 --> 11:08.293
I don't know, but he headed for
the marina about an hour ago.

11:08.502 --> 11:11.338
I wonder what he's up to.

11:17.553 --> 11:20.472
There it is.
The graveyard of ships.

11:26.144 --> 11:28.063
I don't like it.

11:28.230 --> 11:29.648
Hey, look. A bottle.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.277
And there's a note inside.

11:34.778 --> 11:36.280
Well, what does it say?

11:36.446 --> 11:38.782
No deposit, no return.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.158
Big help.

11:40.325 --> 11:43.745
We're getting close. Keep a sharp
lookout for anything suspicious.

11:45.539 --> 11:48.083
Look! One of the yachts
from the marina!

11:48.709 --> 11:51.086
Hey, there's no one aboard...

11:51.253 --> 11:52.838
and the motor's not running.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.507
Then, like, what's making it go?

11:55.674 --> 11:58.176
- Ghost power.
- I was afraid you'd say that.

11:58.468 --> 12:00.971
Come on. Let's follow it.

12:04.641 --> 12:08.186
It's going into that cove,
and there's no way out.

12:10.105 --> 12:11.565
Hey, something's wrong.

12:11.732 --> 12:12.941
It's gone!

12:13.108 --> 12:14.985
Vanished into thin air!

12:15.152 --> 12:17.029
It's, like, weirdo!

12:17.237 --> 12:19.197
Well, like I always say:

12:19.364 --> 12:22.951
“Onward and downward."
To the graveyard of ships, that is.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.343
- We're all set.
- Except for Scooby.

12:39.843 --> 12:41.970
Oh, come down from there!

12:42.179 --> 12:44.973
Scooby, there's nothing to be afraid of.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.478
I'll get him down.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.529
Howdy do!

12:59.696 --> 13:02.532
Howdy do, yourself!
Help!

13:25.722 --> 13:28.850
Like, wow!
What a spooky place.

13:29.142 --> 13:32.604
It's a perfect home
for that seagoing ghost.

13:32.813 --> 13:35.732
Well, if we're going to find
any ghosts, we'd better split up.

13:35.899 --> 13:38.068
You guys go that way
and we'll go this way.

13:38.235 --> 13:40.904
Okay.

13:48.328 --> 13:51.248
Look! What's that?

13:51.415 --> 13:53.834
Could that be Captain Cutler?

13:54.001 --> 13:56.837
It could be, but there's
only one way to find out.

13:57.004 --> 13:58.255
Let's go.

14:03.218 --> 14:05.053
Well, is it him?

14:05.220 --> 14:07.973
No. Look at that old-fashioned
diving suit.

14:08.140 --> 14:10.434
He's been down here a hundred years.

14:12.686 --> 14:13.729
The door!

14:18.066 --> 14:19.109
We're trapped!

14:20.777 --> 14:22.279
Hey, Shaggy, look.

14:50.640 --> 14:53.643
Scuba tanks. Uh-oh!

14:56.313 --> 14:57.397
Scooby-Doo?

14:57.564 --> 15:00.192
Scooby-Doo, where are you?

15:05.489 --> 15:07.699
Hey, Shaggy?

15:08.241 --> 15:10.869
I found a Clue!
I found a Clue!

15:11.036 --> 15:12.120
You found a clue?

15:13.747 --> 15:15.665
Zoinks!

15:22.756 --> 15:24.341
This cannon is loaded.

15:24.508 --> 15:26.551
There's a fuse in it.

15:27.052 --> 15:28.512
Fire!

15:31.389 --> 15:32.682
Like, no fire.

15:32.849 --> 15:35.685
I forgot matches
don't light underwater.

15:45.529 --> 15:47.489
Hold still, Scooby!

15:47.656 --> 15:49.116
I am!

15:54.162 --> 15:56.373
Hey, scram! Shoo! Go!

15:57.999 --> 15:59.334
Uh-oh.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.010
Nice going!

16:09.177 --> 16:11.513
We thought we'd never get out
of this creepy cabin.

16:11.680 --> 16:14.182
Well, like, we never thought
we'd lose that ghost.

16:14.349 --> 16:15.809
Then you saw him too?

16:15.976 --> 16:18.019
He's the one that locked us in.

16:18.186 --> 16:20.689
So we haven't had a chance
to find any clues.

16:20.856 --> 16:22.482
I found a Clue!
I found a Clue!

16:22.649 --> 16:24.276
You? You found a Clue?

16:24.442 --> 16:27.154
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Follow me.

16:30.073 --> 16:33.785
It's a secret storehouse
of scuba tanks.

16:33.952 --> 16:36.121
Yeah, and all ready to use.

16:36.288 --> 16:38.331
Things are beginning to add up.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.417
You mean like two and two are five?

16:40.584 --> 16:42.377
More than that.

16:42.544 --> 16:45.297
I'd like to get
a close look at that ghost.

16:45.463 --> 16:47.591
How can we? He's gone.

16:47.757 --> 16:49.134
But his trail's not.

16:49.301 --> 16:51.386
Look.
Glowing footprints.

16:51.553 --> 16:54.598
Now all we gotta do is follow them.

16:56.057 --> 16:59.394
The footprints vanish
right into the side of the cliff.

16:59.811 --> 17:02.230
Well, if my sense
of direction is right...

17:02.397 --> 17:05.692
this is the same area where that yacht
from the marina vanished.

17:06.193 --> 17:07.360
Now what do we do?

17:07.527 --> 17:09.738
Like, rest.
I'm pooped.

17:09.905 --> 17:12.073
Hey! I'm sinking!

17:13.074 --> 17:15.202
Look!
A secret passage!

17:15.368 --> 17:17.537
You're right!
Shaggy, you're a genius!

17:17.704 --> 17:20.248
- I am?
- Sure. Who else but you...

17:20.415 --> 17:23.084
could've sat down on the rock
that opened the secret passage?

17:23.251 --> 17:25.921
I thought that rock
was pretty suspicious.

17:26.421 --> 17:29.382
Come on, gang. Let's go inside.

17:34.221 --> 17:37.474
Wow! Wow-ee!

17:37.641 --> 17:41.061
We're in a giant underground cavern!

17:43.313 --> 17:46.107
Shoo! Shoo!

17:46.524 --> 17:48.109
Man! Lookie there!

17:48.610 --> 17:50.570
Like, get a load of those yachts.

17:50.737 --> 17:54.115
Yeah, and they're being
painted over in different colors.

17:54.282 --> 17:55.951
Hey, look at that yacht.

17:56.117 --> 17:58.245
It's the one that
vanished in the cove.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.914
And look! It's tied to a minisub.

18:01.081 --> 18:02.958
It's just as we suspected...

18:03.124 --> 18:05.418
and these clues prove it.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.963
Then I guess
this wraps up our mystery.

18:08.338 --> 18:10.840
That is, if we can wrap up the ghost.

18:11.049 --> 18:12.467
Huh?

18:12.634 --> 18:16.471
Not wrap him up, Shaggy,
suds him up.

18:17.722 --> 18:18.807
Hurry up, Fred.

18:18.974 --> 18:22.852
No telling when "glowing gruesome“
will show up.

18:23.478 --> 18:26.481
I'm ready with the fire hose.

18:26.982 --> 18:28.149
Okay, everybody?

18:28.316 --> 18:30.151
I hope your contraption works.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.112
It's a cinch.

18:32.279 --> 18:34.531
We put a bar of soap
in this spray container.

18:34.698 --> 18:36.658
Attach it to this fire hose...

18:36.825 --> 18:39.119
turn on the water,
and instant suds.

18:39.494 --> 18:40.495
And see that ramp?

18:40.662 --> 18:45.292
The ghost comes down it,
we suds it up, he slips...

18:45.458 --> 18:47.460
and we hose him
right over into that net.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.964
Then we hoist him high
as a Christmas goose.

18:52.841 --> 18:56.177
Okay, gang.
Start Operation Noisemaker.

19:11.609 --> 19:13.361
Here he comes.
Let him have it!

19:18.992 --> 19:24.664
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

19:25.874 --> 19:27.667
Huh?

19:34.716 --> 19:35.717
Scooby!

19:38.011 --> 19:40.221
He can't see where he's going!

19:48.146 --> 19:49.397
Huh?

19:49.814 --> 19:52.067
Scooby, are you all right?

19:52.400 --> 19:54.027
Uh-huh.

19:54.194 --> 19:59.157
Now, let's see if our mystery ghost diver
is really Ebenezer Shark.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.411
- It's not him.
- Then who is it?

20:04.079 --> 20:05.830
I got it!

20:06.790 --> 20:11.586
Does this seaweed help remind you
of that picture on Widow Cutler's wall?

20:12.045 --> 20:13.213
Huh?

20:13.380 --> 20:15.757
Captain Cutler!

20:20.220 --> 20:21.596
Hey, listen to this, gang.

20:21.763 --> 20:24.766
"Teenage Sleuths Solve
Boat Hijacking Mystery.

20:24.933 --> 20:28.353
Captain Cutler and his wife
taken into custody by sheriff."

20:28.520 --> 20:30.772
That was some plan they had.

20:30.939 --> 20:33.441
First, spreading the phony story
about Cutler...

20:33.608 --> 20:36.444
and then stealing the yachts
from the marina.

20:36.611 --> 20:40.156
That night on the beach,
Cutler was storing extra scuba tanks...

20:40.323 --> 20:41.483
in the graveyard of ships.

20:41.616 --> 20:43.576
Yeah, but, like, his diving suit...

20:43.743 --> 20:47.288
got covered with that
kooky glowing seaweed.

20:48.998 --> 20:51.709
That's where the glowing ghost
story came from.

20:52.168 --> 20:54.462
Well, that closes the mystery.

21:01.219 --> 21:03.805
How did Scooby do that?

21:03.972 --> 21:07.142
I guess that's another mystery.
