01:29.783 --> 01:31.091
Breaking news.

01:31.092 --> 01:33.882
A robbery took place at
the Louvre museum today.

01:33.883 --> 01:36.632
One high value artifact has been stolen.

01:36.633 --> 01:38.757
Police say a suspect led police
on a high speed chase...

01:38.758 --> 01:42.049
for approximately 18 km
before the man was caught.

01:42.050 --> 01:46.049
A museum official states that the stolen
artifact known as the "eye of the forest"

01:46.050 --> 01:49.674
which, together with the "wings of
destiny" and the "rope of life"

01:49.675 --> 01:52.757
forms a three-piece precious necklace
known as "Gaia".

01:52.758 --> 01:57.132
This 17th century necklace was made as
a gift from Spain to the Chinese emperor.

01:57.133 --> 02:00.341
It was later divided up
and smuggled out of the country.

02:55.217 --> 02:58.050
Looks like you managed to keep in shape.

02:59.008 --> 03:00.008
Thank you!

03:00.175 --> 03:01.341
Need a ride?

03:01.425 --> 03:02.341
I'll walk.

03:02.425 --> 03:03.258
Of course.

03:03.425 --> 03:05.425
After five years in the pen...

03:05.633 --> 03:07.799
I imagine you needed some fresh air.

03:09.175 --> 03:10.675
It's good to be free.

03:11.592 --> 03:15.467
Just because you're out of prison
doesn't mean you're really free.

03:17.550 --> 03:18.633
Yeah!

03:20.008 --> 03:21.508
I could say the same to you.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.341
Tail him.

04:37.925 --> 04:40.008
Impressive work.

04:40.133 --> 04:42.633
Didn't even bother with the alarm.

04:42.758 --> 04:46.299
Probably just tapped right
into the wireless system...

04:46.342 --> 04:50.592
and disabled the security cameras remotely.

04:52.008 --> 04:53.466
Any fingerprints?

04:54.008 --> 04:55.008
No, sir.

04:56.050 --> 04:57.966
Very impressive indeed.

05:02.425 --> 05:04.425
Must be how you earned this.

05:05.175 --> 05:07.216
I'm hoping we can help each other.

05:09.342 --> 05:11.050
Where is he headed?

05:11.633 --> 05:13.508
Screw you, cop.

05:13.633 --> 05:15.383
You know I didn't do this.

05:15.550 --> 05:17.425
You got no evidence on me.

05:23.425 --> 05:24.425
Thank you.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.425
Now I have your fingerprints
at the crime scene.

05:27.508 --> 05:29.716
Pretty damning evidence for a jury.

05:31.925 --> 05:33.425
Where is he?

06:34.758 --> 06:35.633
Comm check.

06:35.634 --> 06:37.258
Crystal clear, comm secure.

07:15.592 --> 07:16.592
Head to the lighthouse.

07:16.633 --> 07:18.216
You'll find everything you need there.

07:49.550 --> 07:51.800
"Watch list"

07:55.633 --> 07:57.049
Want me to Photoshop your picture?

07:57.467 --> 07:59.467
Make sure it looks natural.

08:01.592 --> 08:04.050
Congratulations!
You just turned over a new leaf.

08:14.383 --> 08:18.883
Stop animal cruelty!

08:23.800 --> 08:25.425
Stop animal cruelty!

08:41.592 --> 08:42.924
I'm in.

08:43.299 --> 08:44.383
I'm almost in position.

08:55.758 --> 08:57.716
How's our new partner doing?

08:59.508 --> 09:00.924
She should be here any minute.

09:13.092 --> 09:14.342
Drinks on me!

09:18.925 --> 09:22.383
Hello there. Anybody home?

09:23.467 --> 09:24.633
Good morning.

09:26.717 --> 09:28.175
Welcome.

09:28.346 --> 09:29.883
Allow me to introduce you...

09:30.024 --> 09:31.591
the most beautiful thief of the year...

09:31.592 --> 09:32.842
Red Ye.

09:33.997 --> 09:35.174
I barely know you...

09:35.175 --> 09:36.775
and you're addressing
me by my full name.

09:38.453 --> 09:39.466
Since we still have some time...

09:39.467 --> 09:40.800
why don't we have a chat?

09:41.024 --> 09:42.216
Do you have a boyfriend?

09:42.217 --> 09:44.217
Married?

09:45.550 --> 09:46.716
Are we here for work...

09:46.717 --> 09:48.383
or is this match-making?

09:49.320 --> 09:52.258
I'm starting to have serious doubts
about this guy's work ethic.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.216
Oh, please.

09:54.217 --> 09:55.467
You don't even know me.

09:56.519 --> 09:58.262
Po Chen.

09:58.364 --> 10:01.924
Born 1989 at Yuan General
Hospital in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

10:01.925 --> 10:03.424
Your father worked at a newsstand.

10:03.425 --> 10:04.841
He died when you were 12 years old.

10:04.970 --> 10:06.632
You dropped out of school at 16...

10:06.633 --> 10:08.473
wandered the streets
until you met Dan Zhang...

10:08.175 --> 10:09.674
and you became his protégé.

10:09.675 --> 10:13.091
Rumor has it, you're
a virgin who's a Virgo.

10:13.686 --> 10:16.050
Judging from the way
you just tried to hit on me.

10:16.071 --> 10:17.612
That's no surprise at all.

10:24.258 --> 10:26.883
You think I wouldn't do my
homework before joining a new crew?

10:26.967 --> 10:29.132
Well, if you had done your homework,

10:29.133 --> 10:30.682
you'd also know that I'm
the best hacker in the game.

10:30.703 --> 10:31.842
Okay?

10:32.758 --> 10:35.424
Only insecure people need to brag.

10:36.300 --> 10:38.632
Actions speak louder than words.

10:38.633 --> 10:39.536
Got it?

10:39.557 --> 10:40.630
I'm impressed.

10:40.651 --> 10:42.800
Pretty thorough investigation.

10:45.008 --> 10:45.924
Lady!

10:45.925 --> 10:46.925
You're up.

10:47.508 --> 10:49.216
Show time!

10:49.883 --> 10:53.133
Stop animal cruelty!

10:53.300 --> 10:57.800
Stop animal cruelty!

11:00.633 --> 11:01.966
Alright, stand by.

11:03.695 --> 11:05.278
Any higher?

11:05.710 --> 11:07.126
Last chance.

11:07.175 --> 11:08.716
Going once...

11:09.008 --> 11:10.758
Going twice...

11:11.717 --> 11:14.259
Sold for Eur 200,000.

11:16.651 --> 11:19.067
Thank you, Mr. Jameson

11:22.425 --> 11:25.299
Now for the highlight of the evening,

11:25.300 --> 11:27.807
please welcome Ms. Tingting.

11:30.508 --> 11:32.424
And her one of a kind...

11:32.425 --> 11:34.591
the "wings of destiny".

11:37.008 --> 11:38.258
Thank you.

11:38.592 --> 11:41.217
I hope by auctioning
this treasure of mine...

11:41.300 --> 11:44.648
to help build the largest
wildlife zoo in Europe.

11:44.748 --> 11:48.748
Many endangered animals
can be lifted out of misery.

11:53.031 --> 11:55.322
"Target locked"

12:02.092 --> 12:03.550
3.1 million.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.591
3.2 million.

12:16.633 --> 12:19.091
Po, check it out.

12:20.967 --> 12:22.217
Pierre!

12:22.508 --> 12:24.882
We know him well, he's a French cop.

12:24.883 --> 12:26.591
He specializes in international theft.

12:27.217 --> 12:28.217
Zhang.

12:28.217 --> 12:29.217
He's here for you.

12:31.092 --> 12:32.467
My old friend.

12:32.925 --> 12:34.008
4.5 million.

12:34.508 --> 12:36.841
Do you guys have a plan B?

12:38.508 --> 12:39.466
Zhang.

12:39.467 --> 12:40.800
Your call.

12:43.383 --> 12:44.966
Let's stick to the plan.

12:45.175 --> 12:47.966
I am the one he is trying to hunt.

12:48.425 --> 12:51.091
Demon, come join us.

12:51.508 --> 12:52.508
Copy.

13:05.967 --> 13:07.925
6 million going once...

13:09.467 --> 13:11.092
going twice...

13:15.675 --> 13:17.258
Sold!

13:18.550 --> 13:20.675
There, zoom in.

13:23.467 --> 13:25.175
Hello, Zhang.

13:25.883 --> 13:28.591
Is that the suspect you're
talking about, Inspector?

13:29.383 --> 13:31.424
Should we have him escorted out?

13:31.550 --> 13:33.050
Not yet.

13:40.550 --> 13:41.383
Red Ye. 

13:41.384 --> 13:42.841
You're up next.

13:46.133 --> 13:49.007
Fur is for beautiful animals...

13:49.008 --> 13:51.299
not ugly people!

13:52.092 --> 13:55.258
Tingting loves to wear fur!

14:07.675 --> 14:10.425
Stop animal cruelty!

14:10.842 --> 14:13.008
Storm the auction house!

14:16.592 --> 14:18.383
What are you up to?

14:27.800 --> 14:30.174
Transport the auction
pieces back to the vault.

14:30.175 --> 14:32.466
Bring the guests to the VIP room.

14:38.883 --> 14:40.820
Po, the "wings of destiny" is on you.

14:41.008 --> 14:44.466
Stop killing animals!

15:23.383 --> 15:25.049
There's a robbery in progress.

15:25.050 --> 15:26.300
Open up.

15:30.217 --> 15:31.217
Inspector!

15:31.218 --> 15:33.757
We've been here the whole time.
No one has attempted to...

15:33.758 --> 15:35.549
Call your captain.

15:51.925 --> 15:53.175
Found it.

16:01.008 --> 16:02.608
How much longer do
we have to wait here?

16:05.675 --> 16:07.300
Red Ye, your location.

16:07.717 --> 16:10.425
I'm on the way, are you still inside?

16:11.008 --> 16:12.174
I'm still there.

16:34.467 --> 16:36.174
- Yes.
- Open the vault.

16:36.175 --> 16:38.716
Someone is stealing
the "wings of destiny".

16:38.883 --> 16:39.883
That's impossible.

16:40.550 --> 16:41.799
Listen to me...

16:41.800 --> 16:43.716
This whole protest is a ruse.

16:43.717 --> 16:44.757
Open it!

16:44.758 --> 16:47.841
Perhaps if you'd be kind enough
to share some of your information.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.591
You're wasting time.

16:50.592 --> 16:52.383
Open the vault!

17:04.633 --> 17:06.340
I want everyone on high alert.

17:06.342 --> 17:07.508
Go!

17:17.425 --> 17:18.633
Open the vault.

18:00.842 --> 18:02.383
Come on.

18:14.842 --> 18:16.217
Oh my god!

18:18.467 --> 18:20.549
Lock down all exits to the hotel,

18:20.550 --> 18:22.008
parking lots, everything!

18:22.508 --> 18:24.508
I have the package, let's regroup.

18:25.300 --> 18:26.591
Be patient...

18:26.675 --> 18:28.300
since Pierre is here.

18:28.967 --> 18:30.717
Let's up the ante.

18:30.921 --> 18:32.258
Your turn, demon.

18:35.258 --> 18:36.424
Excuse me.

18:37.383 --> 18:39.216
- Watch!
- Oh, sorry...

18:39.217 --> 18:40.467
It's okay, guys.

18:40.686 --> 18:41.726
Thank you!

18:41.758 --> 18:42.633
You're welcome.

18:42.633 --> 18:43.591
May I sit here?

18:43.592 --> 18:44.508
Sure.

18:44.509 --> 18:46.174
It's alright.

18:56.300 --> 18:58.049
Cannes is full of fanatics.

18:58.050 --> 18:59.300
Yes.

19:00.050 --> 19:01.341
As a matter of fact, I'm
a huge fan of yours.

19:01.342 --> 19:02.466
Really?

19:02.467 --> 19:03.674
Of course.

19:03.675 --> 19:05.633
I've seen all your movies.

19:06.675 --> 19:08.008
What is the name of the movie...

19:21.717 --> 19:22.717
Come on...

19:22.883 --> 19:23.924
Stop that car!

19:23.925 --> 19:25.050
Move!

19:26.050 --> 19:27.133
Go...

19:33.175 --> 19:34.258
Stop!

19:43.883 --> 19:44.674
What?

19:44.675 --> 19:46.050
Your necklace.

20:21.800 --> 20:22.800
Stop!

20:32.342 --> 20:35.217
His driving is pretty damn good.

20:47.008 --> 20:48.091
Out of my way!

20:49.592 --> 20:50.800
Move!

21:28.758 --> 21:30.299
Think of something.

22:08.592 --> 22:10.508
Now I know what your plan B is.

22:10.967 --> 22:12.217
That's good.

22:13.633 --> 22:16.174
Now you can slow down.

22:25.842 --> 22:28.675
All the security footage at
the hotel have been deleted.

22:29.383 --> 22:30.383
Good job.

22:31.114 --> 22:33.424
You're still not retiring?

22:33.425 --> 22:36.716
I still need "Gaia" to
find out who set me up.

22:37.175 --> 22:39.466
Seems like you already
have an answer in mind.

22:39.467 --> 22:42.425
Beware "Gaia" may be a cursed artifact.

22:44.300 --> 22:46.675
Still going back to King Kong?

22:47.675 --> 22:49.758
He's been waiting a
long time for my return.

23:05.175 --> 23:06.425
Dan Zhang.

23:13.050 --> 23:14.850
What an honor to meet
the legendary Dan Zhang.

23:15.057 --> 23:17.341
You're so handsome.

23:17.633 --> 23:18.758
Can I have your autograph?

23:19.467 --> 23:21.217
Do you want my autograph, or money?

23:21.425 --> 23:22.633
Money.

23:24.008 --> 23:26.008
I was told you play fair.

23:26.300 --> 23:28.091
I've been looking for a new partner.

23:28.508 --> 23:29.633
Let me join you guys.

23:30.133 --> 23:31.841
She was pretty good this time.

23:33.383 --> 23:34.674
Didn't Kong tell you
before he sent you here?

23:34.675 --> 23:36.383
That was my last job.

23:38.175 --> 23:39.925
I'll find you if I
come out of retirement.

23:40.663 --> 23:42.257
Your welcome gift is like a rocket.

23:42.258 --> 23:43.341
You should give it a try.

23:44.508 --> 23:45.758
I'll try it for you.

24:22.883 --> 24:26.132
It is in this very tunnel,
the Cantaron's tunnel...

24:26.133 --> 24:28.507
A car crash between
vehicles took place...

24:28.508 --> 24:31.007
stemming from a car chase...

24:31.008 --> 24:33.382
involving two alleged thieves...

24:33.383 --> 24:35.841
and a police officer,
acting on his own.

24:35.842 --> 24:38.424
As you can see behind me,
rescue team arrived on the scene.

24:38.425 --> 24:40.800
Details are still
unclear at this time.

24:42.675 --> 24:46.175
Damn it, Pierre.
This is your idea of "observing"?

24:46.550 --> 24:47.550
Sit.

24:48.550 --> 24:50.841
You know why I'm the one
with this office right now...

24:50.842 --> 24:51.967
and not you?

24:52.133 --> 24:54.174
You're a better ass-kisser than me.

24:54.342 --> 24:55.342
Maybe.

24:55.675 --> 24:57.757
But I'm not your partner anymore.

24:57.758 --> 24:59.008
I'm your superior.

24:59.675 --> 25:02.091
From now on, you'll share
your Intel and collaborate.

25:02.092 --> 25:03.300
Is that clear?

25:05.383 --> 25:07.091
What the hell are those?

25:08.717 --> 25:10.092
Chinese stress balls.

25:10.842 --> 25:12.550
Helps me to relax.

25:12.842 --> 25:14.675
You should give them a try.

25:16.342 --> 25:17.633
I want to bring on help.

25:18.092 --> 25:20.467
Good, take anyone you want.

25:21.175 --> 25:22.050
Not a cop...

25:22.051 --> 25:23.258
an expert.

25:23.508 --> 25:26.049
Someone who can lead
me right to Zhang.

25:26.050 --> 25:28.507
Who said anything about outside, I...

25:28.508 --> 25:30.091
You wanted me to collaborate.

25:30.092 --> 25:31.425
With cops!

25:35.383 --> 25:38.799
If you lose him again, I won't
be able to save your ass.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.091
Understand?

25:50.008 --> 25:52.674
These cracks were not caused by hand.

25:56.300 --> 25:59.049
Seems pretty straight
forward to me...

25:59.050 --> 26:01.300
this painting is from
the 19th century.

26:01.425 --> 26:04.924
Its canvas is coated with a
protective rabbit skin gesso...

26:04.925 --> 26:07.382
which is highly sensitive to humidity.

26:07.383 --> 26:09.841
As you can now see for yourself.

26:10.550 --> 26:12.050
Is it covered by our policy?

26:13.217 --> 26:14.799
I'm sorry. But...

26:14.800 --> 26:17.924
Failure to maintain proper
humidity levels in the gallery...

26:17.925 --> 26:19.841
ls considered human error.

26:19.967 --> 26:22.341
I'm sorry, but it's not
covered by our policy.

26:22.342 --> 26:24.300
If you'd like us to
investigate further,

26:24.842 --> 26:26.717
please let us know.

26:30.842 --> 26:32.091
Amber Li?

26:32.092 --> 26:34.383
Inspector Pierre Bissette.

26:35.800 --> 26:37.216
What can I do for you?

26:37.217 --> 26:40.549
You have knowledge
about a particular case...

26:40.550 --> 26:43.508
that I believe could be useful to me.

26:43.925 --> 26:46.466
I was assigned to the case
of Tingting's necklace.

26:46.467 --> 26:48.883
Somehow I don't think that's
what you are here for.

26:49.342 --> 26:50.967
Do you know this man?

26:53.050 --> 26:55.550
You already know the
answer to that question.

26:55.883 --> 26:57.299
Did he steal it?

26:58.008 --> 27:01.133
I think you already know
the answer to that question.

27:02.967 --> 27:05.008
Has he tried to contact you?

27:05.842 --> 27:07.508
Am I a suspect?

27:08.425 --> 27:09.341
No.

27:09.342 --> 27:12.842
I haven't had any contact with
him since he went to jail.

27:13.133 --> 27:14.518
I didn't even know he got out.

27:15.300 --> 27:18.008
I know how it feels to be betrayed.

27:18.800 --> 27:23.133
Nice try inspector.
Don't play mind games with me.

27:23.550 --> 27:25.466
You don't know the
first thing about me.

27:25.467 --> 27:27.716
I know that Zhang targeted you,

27:27.717 --> 27:32.217
then used your inside information
to steal the "eye of the forest".

27:34.467 --> 27:36.300
So you want to use me as bait?

27:36.592 --> 27:38.549
You know him better than anyone.

27:38.550 --> 27:39.383
With your help...

27:39.384 --> 27:41.591
I don't know him any
better than I know you.

27:42.050 --> 27:44.008
Good luck, Inspector.

27:48.258 --> 27:50.424
Call me, if you change your mind.

27:51.342 --> 27:52.550
Thank you.

28:38.467 --> 28:40.342
How have you been?

28:42.508 --> 28:44.341
I'm doing okay.

29:19.342 --> 29:20.425
Yes?

29:20.508 --> 29:22.466
I'll help you on one condition...

29:22.925 --> 29:23.883
When this is all over,

29:23.884 --> 29:26.883
you make sure Zhang
gets locked up for good.

29:27.175 --> 29:28.341
Deal!

29:28.633 --> 29:30.007
Now tell me...

29:30.008 --> 29:31.841
where is the "Rope of Life"?

29:32.717 --> 29:34.217
Are you willing to travel?

30:26.467 --> 30:27.425
Good to see you back.

30:27.426 --> 30:28.925
Kong is waiting for you.

30:43.300 --> 30:44.466
Uncle Kong!

30:54.008 --> 30:55.674
I've been waiting for you.

31:03.424 --> 31:04.965
I know.

31:04.986 --> 31:06.735
I can always count on you.

31:06.967 --> 31:07.967
Well done.

31:16.633 --> 31:17.983
A new hobby you picked up?

31:18.004 --> 31:19.717
Not a bad way to kill time.

31:19.883 --> 31:22.216
You should consider
it after you retire.

31:24.967 --> 31:26.175
Taiwan boy.

31:26.925 --> 31:28.050
You two are still working together?

31:28.342 --> 31:29.342
Uncle Kong.

31:29.967 --> 31:31.258
Good work.

31:37.092 --> 31:38.883
Before your incident,

31:39.342 --> 31:41.799
I knew you wanted to retire.

31:41.800 --> 31:45.091
But I couldn't count on
anyone else to get this done.

31:45.883 --> 31:47.424
This cheque...

31:47.425 --> 31:49.466
I should've given it to you years ago.

31:51.419 --> 31:52.835
Don't worry. It's safe

31:58.296 --> 31:59.629
I know it's less than you expect.

32:00.175 --> 32:01.862
I took some out...

32:04.717 --> 32:06.217
for this.

32:09.425 --> 32:10.466
After you got caught,

32:11.050 --> 32:12.924
I put the word out to
track down the guy...

32:12.925 --> 32:15.550
who stole the "eye of
the forest" from you.

32:17.138 --> 32:18.513
It took a while.

32:21.008 --> 32:22.466
It was this bastard.

32:27.631 --> 32:28.963
Is that a tongue?

32:29.050 --> 32:30.383
Yes.

32:33.170 --> 32:34.878
So the rumour is true.
You did it.

32:35.412 --> 32:37.452
There's a honor code amongst thieves.

32:37.633 --> 32:39.174
I can't kill,

32:39.175 --> 32:40.925
but I can pay others to get it done.

32:42.561 --> 32:44.561
Money well spent.

32:46.175 --> 32:48.300
You're like a son to me.

32:49.318 --> 32:51.158
Did you ever find out
who tipped off the cops?

32:55.675 --> 32:58.675
Don't try to guess if you
have absolutely no idea.

32:59.193 --> 33:02.484
You're better off not knowing.

33:03.039 --> 33:04.705
I want to know.

33:05.787 --> 33:07.037
It was your fiancée.

33:07.484 --> 33:08.650
Amber.

33:18.252 --> 33:20.002
I suppose I deserved it.

33:23.633 --> 33:27.906
Is there a chance for one more job,
so I can score a big one before I retire?

33:27.927 --> 33:29.426
Of course!

33:29.467 --> 33:31.141
If you combine these three artefacts,

33:31.161 --> 33:32.773
it'd take you lifetimes to
spend what "Gaia" is worth.

33:32.794 --> 33:34.999
All we need now is the "Rope of Life".

33:36.086 --> 33:38.169
You have to be sure about this.

33:39.217 --> 33:40.457
There can't be anymore missteps.

33:46.786 --> 33:48.286
You know what's fascinating...

33:48.529 --> 33:50.362
about nesting dolls?

33:51.169 --> 33:53.279
You begin by making the smallest one.

33:54.737 --> 33:56.778
The shape and size of this core figure...

33:57.508 --> 33:59.049
determines the fate...

33:59.050 --> 34:00.758
of the rest of the dolls that follow.

34:01.569 --> 34:02.902
It's interesting, isn't it?

34:03.875 --> 34:05.208
That's destiny.

34:07.967 --> 34:09.300
Understood.

34:12.425 --> 34:14.132
Let's hear the plan.

34:16.425 --> 34:18.687
Now that you've taken the cheque...

34:18.708 --> 34:20.800
why not get out of the
game while you still can?

34:21.219 --> 34:22.469
What can I say?

34:22.681 --> 34:24.556
I'm greedy and I like money.

34:25.125 --> 34:27.916
A fortune is worthless to a dead man.

34:29.425 --> 34:32.050
Do you really believe that
Amber betrayed you that day?

34:32.237 --> 34:34.527
You wanted to retire because of her.

34:35.382 --> 34:36.716
Amber is a good person,
and I'm a thief...

34:36.717 --> 34:38.257
but I can't fool her forever.

34:45.342 --> 34:47.800
We're being tailed, don't look back.

34:48.132 --> 34:49.507
Let's split up.

34:50.507 --> 34:52.674
Okay. See you later.

35:29.092 --> 35:30.050
Give it to me.

35:30.050 --> 35:31.050
Give you what?

35:31.051 --> 35:33.993
The "Eye of Forest", the "Wings
of Destiny", Tingting's necklace.

35:34.758 --> 35:37.133
You're so sure that I'm responsible?

35:38.175 --> 35:39.855
Why would they lock
you up if you weren't?

35:39.883 --> 35:41.230
You never gave me a
chance to explain.

35:41.251 --> 35:42.966
You've never visited me
once in the past five years.

35:42.967 --> 35:44.383
I'm not gonna listen to
your so-called explanations.

35:44.414 --> 35:45.918
Then what are you doing here?

35:46.092 --> 35:48.424
I'm helping the police
with their investigation...

35:48.425 --> 35:50.966
so they will lock you up for good.

35:57.210 --> 36:00.126
If they have any
evidence that I did it,

36:00.147 --> 36:01.605
they can come and arrest me.

36:04.878 --> 36:06.544
Stop following me.

36:22.467 --> 36:23.425
It's complete.

36:23.467 --> 36:24.550
Yeah.

36:30.300 --> 36:31.716
Interesting.

36:42.508 --> 36:43.633
Enough!

36:44.467 --> 36:45.592
Try this one.

36:56.883 --> 36:57.924
"Gaia".

37:00.133 --> 37:02.049
Look in the most recent folder.

37:03.342 --> 37:04.133
That's him!

37:04.134 --> 37:06.424
The guy who owns the "Rope of Life".

37:06.467 --> 37:07.550
You know him?

37:07.717 --> 37:08.758
I've met him briefly.

37:10.675 --> 37:12.425
That's pretty high tech...

37:13.467 --> 37:15.967
Should we tell Kong
that we're backing out?

37:16.550 --> 37:17.425
No.

37:17.425 --> 37:18.133
Why?

37:18.134 --> 37:19.633
The operation is compromised.

37:19.758 --> 37:21.257
Scrap the original plan.

37:21.258 --> 37:22.799
We're going for plan B.

37:22.925 --> 37:24.008
Plan B?

37:56.381 --> 37:57.797
Nature calls!

38:10.310 --> 38:11.685
You don't need to go?

38:12.633 --> 38:14.133
I'll hold it in.

38:16.800 --> 38:19.133
they say holding it in is bad for you.

38:22.675 --> 38:24.425
I knew this would happen.

38:30.799 --> 38:32.007
What is this?

38:33.258 --> 38:35.799
A female urination
device for the wilderness.

38:36.258 --> 38:38.174
Now you can pee standing up.

38:38.175 --> 38:38.966
What do you think?

38:38.967 --> 38:40.675
Now we can pee together standing up.

38:42.342 --> 38:43.967
Are you insane?

38:49.300 --> 38:50.550
What's that?

38:50.675 --> 38:52.425
A female urination device.

38:53.342 --> 38:54.508
Is it useful?

38:54.880 --> 38:56.171
You're sick!

39:24.633 --> 39:25.716
Po.

39:30.843 --> 39:32.009
Come on.

39:56.925 --> 39:58.133
That's him?

40:01.602 --> 40:02.893
Whatever you do...

40:02.955 --> 40:04.121
find out as much as you
can about the castle...

40:04.217 --> 40:06.008
and where he keeps the "Rope of Life".

40:06.508 --> 40:08.049
Piece of cake.

41:05.503 --> 41:06.253
Buddy!

41:06.301 --> 41:07.508
Stop...

41:07.800 --> 41:08.966
Stop!

41:22.133 --> 41:23.383
What was that?

41:27.592 --> 41:29.007
That was your plan?

41:29.008 --> 41:30.591
To not talk to him?

41:30.592 --> 41:32.717
How are we gonna be able
to get the "Rope of Life"?

41:32.811 --> 41:34.019
Let's go.

41:35.440 --> 41:37.606
You'll never understand
what women are thinking!

41:45.300 --> 41:47.883
Mr. Law, please, a word?

41:49.133 --> 41:50.341
Sir...

41:50.342 --> 41:52.925
Are you still the owner
of the "Rope of Life"?

41:55.592 --> 41:58.425
I believe you've been
targeted by a group of thieves.

42:01.217 --> 42:03.382
These are no ordinary thieves.

42:03.383 --> 42:07.674
They have already stolen the two
other components that make up "Gaia".

42:08.467 --> 42:09.716
I see.

42:09.717 --> 42:11.675
Now all they need is yours.

42:12.633 --> 42:14.174
Inspector...

42:14.175 --> 42:16.814
if they can get pass
the state of the art...

42:16.835 --> 42:19.174
security systems I installed...

42:19.420 --> 42:21.003
Let them have it.

42:21.477 --> 42:23.518
Excuse's moi.

42:28.258 --> 42:29.508
Prick!

42:31.669 --> 42:32.794
Hi.

42:57.217 --> 42:58.967
Have we met before?

43:00.675 --> 43:04.008
Is that the best pick up line
you can come up with?

43:08.937 --> 43:10.187
What's wrong?

43:10.409 --> 43:12.075
Is it the wine?

43:13.425 --> 43:16.466
It's not the wine. It's the venue.

43:19.425 --> 43:20.925
What do you mean?

43:21.633 --> 43:24.674
People need to be in a certain
mood to enjoy fine wine.

43:25.258 --> 43:27.466
The place is nice enough...

43:27.467 --> 43:30.217
but it's lacking two key elements.

43:30.800 --> 43:32.091
And what might those be?

43:34.258 --> 43:35.507
Music and...

43:35.508 --> 43:36.508
friends.

43:38.925 --> 43:40.466
Not only do you know wine...

43:40.467 --> 43:41.925
you know how to enjoy life.

43:43.592 --> 43:45.049
Let me introduce myself.

43:45.050 --> 43:46.216
Charlie Law.

43:46.217 --> 43:47.758
I own this winery.

43:48.217 --> 43:49.758
I've heard all about you.

43:50.323 --> 43:52.114
I work for a wine magazine.

43:52.217 --> 43:53.383
Rose.

43:53.800 --> 43:55.425
I'm a wine critic.

43:56.592 --> 43:59.550
I assume I won't be getting
a good review from you.

44:00.448 --> 44:01.698
Sorry.

44:02.258 --> 44:04.216
- It was nice meeting you, I should go.
- Wait.

44:14.420 --> 44:15.711
Now that we have music.

44:16.550 --> 44:18.258
All you need is a companion.

44:18.804 --> 44:20.137
Care to be my friend?

44:22.521 --> 44:23.812
I already have plenty of friends.

44:24.008 --> 44:25.508
How about...

44:25.897 --> 44:28.063
we do an interview?

44:28.300 --> 44:29.758
Would you be interested?

44:34.857 --> 44:35.857
Call me.

44:36.550 --> 44:37.633
Bye bye.

44:58.453 --> 45:00.161
Why isn't he calling?

45:01.300 --> 45:02.591
He will soon.

45:03.342 --> 45:05.549
How do you know he'll call?

45:05.550 --> 45:08.091
How do you know he won't?

45:08.425 --> 45:09.258
He...

45:09.259 --> 45:10.841
"It's me Charlie. I'll call you now"

45:12.675 --> 45:14.008
See?

45:18.959 --> 45:20.250
Hello?

45:20.745 --> 45:22.952
Hi, Rose. It's Charlie.

45:22.992 --> 45:24.117
Hey, what's up?

45:25.690 --> 45:27.648
I'd like to schedule the interview.

45:27.893 --> 45:28.893
Tomorrow?

45:28.969 --> 45:29.719
Great!

45:29.758 --> 45:30.758
I'm busy.

45:33.234 --> 45:34.358
The day after tomorrow?

45:34.383 --> 45:35.152
Sure.

45:35.217 --> 45:38.133
Would you like to come to my office?

45:42.842 --> 45:44.256
Text me the address.

45:44.717 --> 45:46.175
My driver can pick you up.

45:47.092 --> 45:48.133
why'd you hang up?

45:48.925 --> 45:50.883
He didn't even finish.

45:51.276 --> 45:53.248
You're so annoying.

45:54.057 --> 45:55.057
Where are you going?

45:55.176 --> 45:57.466
Checking whether the facial
mask worked its magic.

45:58.690 --> 46:00.273
He's calling back!

46:01.425 --> 46:03.050
You answer it.

46:06.633 --> 46:07.799
She was just... 

46:32.883 --> 46:35.174
Could you please stop doing that?

46:35.175 --> 46:37.508
Sorry, stress relief.

46:38.383 --> 46:40.091
Doctor's orders.

46:40.592 --> 46:41.883
Does it work?

46:42.133 --> 46:43.591
Not really.

46:53.508 --> 46:56.799
You seem really obsessed with him.
Why?

46:56.800 --> 46:59.549
I'm not obsessed.
He's a thief, I'm a cop.

46:59.550 --> 47:01.591
My duty is to catch him.

47:01.592 --> 47:02.758
That's it.

47:18.717 --> 47:21.133
I'm just curious.

47:22.633 --> 47:23.841
Sorry...

47:24.592 --> 47:26.508
if I made you uncomfortable.

47:32.467 --> 47:35.549
You know when Zhang stole
the "Eye of the Forest"...

47:35.550 --> 47:38.300
I chased him through
the streets of Paris.

47:39.008 --> 47:40.674
Almost had him...

47:41.467 --> 47:43.592
when a car crashed into me.

47:43.883 --> 47:46.383
I was trapped in the wreckage.

47:46.550 --> 47:49.258
I thought for sure I was going to die.

48:53.800 --> 48:56.591
You know why I want
to get him so bad?

48:57.300 --> 49:00.507
Because he's the worst
kind of thief there is.

49:00.508 --> 49:04.258
The kind that has
Patience, and integrity.

49:04.967 --> 49:07.675
The kind that if I don't get him now...

49:07.842 --> 49:10.717
I'm afraid I won't ever get him.

49:32.092 --> 49:33.092
It's her.

49:33.508 --> 49:34.841
Now what?

49:34.842 --> 49:37.175
We wait and we follow her.

49:40.092 --> 49:41.550
There's interference in the feed.

49:44.847 --> 49:46.138
How about now?

49:50.008 --> 49:51.008
Good.

50:06.633 --> 50:08.091
This way please.

50:09.925 --> 50:11.924
Take a good look.

50:11.925 --> 50:13.091
Copy.

50:25.390 --> 50:26.790
You mind if I record the interview?

50:27.529 --> 50:28.695
Not at all.

50:31.550 --> 50:32.425
Alright.

50:32.426 --> 50:34.216
Let's begin.

50:35.441 --> 50:37.086
Mr. Law, what year were you born?

50:37.614 --> 50:38.638
In 1978.

50:39.508 --> 50:41.883
On the 31st of this month...

50:42.289 --> 50:44.285
I'm throwing myself a
birthday party here.

50:44.534 --> 50:46.034
I'd like for you to be there.

50:47.175 --> 50:48.299
Maybe.

50:48.300 --> 50:49.980
Let's get on with the
interview, shall we?

50:51.467 --> 50:53.152
When was the first
time you tasted wine?

50:53.254 --> 50:54.300
16 years old.

50:54.508 --> 50:55.924
Do you remember what kind it was?

50:56.175 --> 50:58.633
No, but it was expensive for sure.

50:59.467 --> 51:01.307
So as long as the wine's
expensive, it's good?

51:01.800 --> 51:05.133
Not just wine,
it applies to everything.

51:06.383 --> 51:08.216
Money means a lot to you, doesn't it?

51:08.217 --> 51:09.550
Of course.

51:11.300 --> 51:12.133
Mr. Law...

51:12.134 --> 51:15.591
how would you describe
your occupation?

51:16.092 --> 51:17.092
Making money.

51:17.256 --> 51:19.044
Big and small.

51:19.115 --> 51:20.489
For example this castle.

51:20.592 --> 51:24.383
I live here but I also open
parts of it for tourists.

51:25.050 --> 51:28.050
What's the most valuable
item in your collection?

51:34.997 --> 51:37.688
Have you heard of the "Rope of Life"?

51:38.659 --> 51:42.534
No, but now that you mention it...

51:44.050 --> 51:45.590
I have an idea.

51:45.743 --> 51:48.549
How about I take a picture of
you and the "Rope of Life"?

51:48.550 --> 51:51.466
It'd make the article more enticing.

51:52.592 --> 51:53.758
Now?

51:54.339 --> 51:55.339
Yes.

51:56.175 --> 51:57.175
Sure!

51:57.550 --> 51:58.800
Follow me.

51:59.007 --> 52:00.215
Right this way.

52:02.175 --> 52:03.966
It's secret passage.

52:05.924 --> 52:08.174
Must be standard for the rich.

52:10.425 --> 52:13.341
Your security system here
must be one of a kind.

52:13.342 --> 52:16.507
Everything is linked up to
the security control center.

52:16.640 --> 52:17.931
There are cameras in there...

52:18.052 --> 52:19.949
that are connected to my cell phone.

52:20.133 --> 52:21.758
Good morning, Mr. Law.

52:29.175 --> 52:30.800
Here is my collection.

52:31.633 --> 52:33.466
Out of all the artifacts...

52:33.555 --> 52:36.138
this is my favorite.

52:40.467 --> 52:41.842
It's stunning.

52:42.425 --> 52:44.675
It must be very expensive.

52:45.513 --> 52:48.563
A lot of people would kill
to get their hands on it.

52:48.679 --> 52:51.387
as it's one of the most coveted
pieces of jewelry in the world.

52:54.833 --> 52:56.999
Buddy is my most trusted
security team member.

52:57.956 --> 52:59.956
Yes, we've met before.

53:01.383 --> 53:02.935
Buddy is actually very friendly.

53:02.956 --> 53:04.656
He's just a little playful sometimes.

53:04.677 --> 53:06.050
Try calling his name.

53:09.226 --> 53:10.434
Buddy!

53:15.300 --> 53:16.507
Let's start talking some pictures.

53:16.508 --> 53:17.633
Okay.

53:20.050 --> 53:21.050
Alright.

53:22.092 --> 53:23.300
Ready.

53:29.385 --> 53:31.926
Sorry, there's a reflection...

53:32.021 --> 53:33.895
from the glass.

53:33.967 --> 53:35.342
No problem, I can open it up.

53:44.570 --> 53:46.028
Looks very high tech.

53:46.342 --> 53:47.675
Alright, again.

53:48.162 --> 53:51.620
Give me a high-spirited pose.

53:52.133 --> 53:53.341
Wait a minute.

53:54.990 --> 53:56.240
Fine.

53:56.550 --> 53:58.050
Alright.

53:58.883 --> 54:01.799
Give me a pose with a homely feeling.

54:04.062 --> 54:05.353
Perfect. Now some full body shots

54:05.550 --> 54:06.716
Great.

54:07.717 --> 54:08.758
Let me get a top shot.

54:14.800 --> 54:16.133
Sure.

54:16.930 --> 54:19.857
Imagine you're
presenting it with pride.

54:23.467 --> 54:25.508
Can you step to your left?

54:26.971 --> 54:28.679
A little more.

54:33.133 --> 54:34.591
Just a little more.

54:35.229 --> 54:36.520
More?

54:36.883 --> 54:38.549
Are you sure you can still see me?

54:39.050 --> 54:40.341
Perfect from this angle.

54:46.822 --> 54:51.237
During the Nazi occupation of
Czechoslovakia in World War II...

54:51.258 --> 54:54.007
the castle was inhabited by the Nazis.

54:54.008 --> 54:56.841
An underground secret passageway
was built as an escape route.

54:56.842 --> 54:58.674
It connects the basement of the
castle all the way to the winery. 

54:58.675 --> 55:02.550
In fact, the wine cellar
was used as a bomb shelter.

55:11.883 --> 55:14.424
Here she is, coming out.

55:57.842 --> 55:59.133
That's way off!

56:00.300 --> 56:01.800
Hello Inspector.

56:06.092 --> 56:10.592
I see your time behind bars
did little to rehabilitate you.

56:11.217 --> 56:12.675
Not true.

56:13.175 --> 56:14.883
I tried painting.

56:15.508 --> 56:18.299
But I'm just better at
stealing art than making it.

56:18.967 --> 56:21.342
Once a thief, always a thief.

56:22.592 --> 56:24.175
Easy.

56:24.883 --> 56:28.049
I wouldn't be here if
I didn't want to talk.

56:28.508 --> 56:29.674
I'm listening.

56:30.300 --> 56:31.300
Amber.

56:31.592 --> 56:33.342
That's your business.

56:33.883 --> 56:35.841
Mine is to bring you in.

56:36.175 --> 56:38.591
You dragged her into this mess.

56:39.175 --> 56:41.550
That makes it your business.

56:43.092 --> 56:44.425
Give this to her...

56:44.800 --> 56:46.383
and keep her out of this.

56:49.592 --> 56:51.008
What's going on?

56:59.717 --> 57:01.342
He still cares for you.

57:05.008 --> 57:09.508
You said you know how
it feels to be betrayed.

57:10.717 --> 57:12.008
Who was it?

57:13.508 --> 57:16.758
Since when are you
interested in bonding?

57:20.419 --> 57:23.752
When I was a boy, my father
was the greatest man I knew.

57:24.258 --> 57:26.591
Everybody loved him, respected him.

57:27.133 --> 57:30.049
He traveled a lot...
For work he said.

57:30.800 --> 57:33.716
Used to bring me trinkets
and tell me that...

57:33.717 --> 57:37.175
one day I'd go with him.

57:40.300 --> 57:42.758
I was 14 when the police came.

57:45.175 --> 57:47.841
Raided our home and seized everything.

57:51.258 --> 57:55.591
I don't know if the trinkets
he gave me were stolen or not.

57:56.717 --> 57:58.175
Doesn't matter.

58:04.592 --> 58:06.550
Cops took them all away.

58:07.133 --> 58:08.758
My dad too.

58:09.675 --> 58:11.341
He went to jail.

58:13.175 --> 58:15.133
Left us with nothing.

58:22.092 --> 58:24.342
Did you ever confront your father?

58:25.217 --> 58:26.842
He died in prison.

58:29.550 --> 58:33.216
People like Zhang and my
father, they destroy lives.

58:33.592 --> 58:36.258
It isn't just objects they steal.

58:36.633 --> 58:38.716
It is trust as well.

58:41.217 --> 58:43.425
Well, I don't have to tell you this.

58:49.425 --> 58:51.258
Why did you agree to help me?

58:59.925 --> 59:01.300
One day...

59:02.092 --> 59:04.383
someone offers you an opportunity...

59:04.758 --> 59:07.424
to put away someone you
tried so hard to forget...

59:07.633 --> 59:08.966
but couldn't.

59:10.592 --> 59:14.717
So you take it, because
it is the right thing to do.

59:15.717 --> 59:19.758
I just didn't realize
how hard it would be.

59:23.175 --> 59:25.216
As much as I hate him...

59:27.008 --> 59:27.966
I still...

59:27.967 --> 59:29.592
Say no more.

59:29.758 --> 59:31.174
I understand.

59:38.342 --> 59:42.467
It looks like our pal Charlie's
throwing a party at the castle.

59:42.717 --> 59:43.717
I have to go.

59:44.092 --> 59:45.383
I'm going with you.

59:47.592 --> 59:49.342
I want to.

59:57.550 --> 59:58.550
Hey!

59:58.758 --> 01:00:02.049
What kind of fingerprint
scanner is this?

01:00:02.342 --> 01:00:04.091
It's a pain to wear.

01:00:04.092 --> 01:00:05.341
Help me lace this up.

01:00:05.342 --> 01:00:06.508
Come on.

01:00:27.008 --> 01:00:29.924
This is a high-risk operation.

01:00:30.133 --> 01:00:32.549
Which operation isn't?

01:00:34.258 --> 01:00:35.674
If anything happens.

01:00:36.258 --> 01:00:39.549
I mean, if one of us gets caught...

01:00:41.195 --> 01:00:42.736
I can't save you.

01:00:43.675 --> 01:00:45.341
You don't have to save me either.

01:00:45.967 --> 01:00:47.925
This is a rule set by Zhang.

01:00:49.508 --> 01:00:51.466
That's a strange rule.

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.591
It's too tight.

01:01:10.675 --> 01:01:12.050
Let's give it a try.

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.425
You need to hold on tighter.

01:01:41.008 --> 01:01:43.299
What are all these red flags?

01:01:43.633 --> 01:01:45.549
Surveillance cameras.

01:01:45.550 --> 01:01:48.924
Their range is around 50 meters.

01:01:48.925 --> 01:01:51.341
And they cover the whole
perimeter of the castle.

01:01:53.092 --> 01:01:54.967
That's really difficult to get in.

01:01:55.342 --> 01:01:57.842
That's why we won't be
going in on ground level.

01:01:58.140 --> 01:01:59.556
Then how would we get in?

01:01:59.612 --> 01:02:01.411
Getting inside is not impossible.

01:02:03.633 --> 01:02:06.216
We can enter from the winery...

01:02:06.787 --> 01:02:08.287
that's adjacent to the castle.

01:02:15.841 --> 01:02:18.799
In there?
Are we gonna suffocate to death?

01:02:29.014 --> 01:02:30.889
The winery needs some new barrels.

01:02:32.092 --> 01:02:35.342
That's how demon will sneak us in.

01:02:40.175 --> 01:02:42.675
The manhole leads directly to
the underground passageway...

01:02:45.050 --> 01:02:48.883
that will take us to the
castle's security control center.

01:02:50.008 --> 01:02:51.008
Po.

01:02:59.550 --> 01:03:02.466
Once I get there,
I'll take out the guards.

01:03:05.175 --> 01:03:08.216
Then turn off the surveillance
cameras and the security system.

01:03:09.717 --> 01:03:13.717
Happy birthday to you.

01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:24.765
Zhang will enter the vault
from the watchtower.

01:03:24.842 --> 01:03:26.092
Exactly.

01:03:40.175 --> 01:03:41.300
Got it!

01:04:33.547 --> 01:04:35.963
And who's going to open the vault?

01:04:38.919 --> 01:04:40.877
You've already planted the seed.

01:05:08.675 --> 01:05:10.008
Laser system is down.

01:05:46.237 --> 01:05:47.737
You look absolutely gorgeous today.

01:05:48.382 --> 01:05:49.757
Thank you.

01:05:50.552 --> 01:05:51.717
I know that you've got everything.

01:05:51.738 --> 01:05:53.821
So I didn't bring a present.

01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:56.310
You coming tonight is the
best present I could ask for.

01:05:59.383 --> 01:06:00.674
Happy birthday.

01:06:00.791 --> 01:06:02.082
Thank you.

01:07:47.842 --> 01:07:49.175
Scared the crap out of me.

01:07:50.842 --> 01:07:52.258
What the hell just happened?

01:07:53.633 --> 01:07:55.174
It's a long story.

01:07:55.175 --> 01:07:57.550
Go... Go.

01:08:07.425 --> 01:08:10.815
Women are just gifts to
you, aren't they?

01:08:10.836 --> 01:08:12.002
Of course not.

01:08:12.092 --> 01:08:13.300
Then what are they?

01:08:13.321 --> 01:08:14.737
Like you...

01:08:14.955 --> 01:08:16.537
they should be gift receivers.

01:08:29.216 --> 01:08:30.675
The scan failed.

01:08:31.466 --> 01:08:32.466
Try it again.

01:08:42.799 --> 01:08:44.350
So you have a gift for me?

01:08:55.823 --> 01:08:57.863
Let's go back to China together...

01:08:59.008 --> 01:09:00.634
wearing the "Rope of Life".

01:09:11.019 --> 01:09:12.268
Okay, it's done.

01:09:12.288 --> 01:09:13.288
Say goodbye.

01:09:16.258 --> 01:09:17.924
Excuse me, I need
to use the bathroom.

01:09:23.050 --> 01:09:24.383
Transmitting.

01:09:31.675 --> 01:09:33.050
I'm outside the vault.

01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:38.966
Time for spidey.

01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:17.128
What's happening?

01:10:18.987 --> 01:10:20.987
Charlie's dog is attacking spidey.

01:10:21.810 --> 01:10:24.310
We're running out of time.

01:10:28.008 --> 01:10:29.674
Sorry doggy.

01:10:29.862 --> 01:10:31.278
You made me do this.

01:11:10.092 --> 01:11:11.425
Mr. Law.

01:11:11.842 --> 01:11:13.674
The policeman is here again.

01:11:13.675 --> 01:11:15.383
He says it's urgent.

01:11:18.675 --> 01:11:20.091
Mr. Law.

01:11:37.008 --> 01:11:38.841
Zhang, your old friend is here.

01:11:40.425 --> 01:11:42.300
Po, we're running out of time.

01:12:39.842 --> 01:12:40.883
Red is in trouble.

01:12:47.675 --> 01:12:49.300
Send over the fingerprints.

01:12:49.675 --> 01:12:50.591
Zhang.

01:12:50.592 --> 01:12:51.758
Now!

01:12:53.287 --> 01:12:54.578
So I'm just part of your plan.

01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:58.133
Check your vault.

01:13:01.258 --> 01:13:02.966
Everything is fine.

01:13:06.967 --> 01:13:08.342
Buddy?

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:11.883
You've been robbed
right under your nose.

01:13:12.972 --> 01:13:14.263
Come with me!

01:13:14.675 --> 01:13:15.800
They're heading your way.

01:13:32.758 --> 01:13:34.007
They will reach you soon.

01:13:34.008 --> 01:13:35.341
Get yourself out of there.

01:13:40.429 --> 01:13:41.470
What about Red Ye?

01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:45.620
Leave now!
Before they catch you.

01:13:55.677 --> 01:13:56.968
Find them!

01:13:57.425 --> 01:13:58.962
Alert, all personnel!

01:14:17.234 --> 01:14:19.192
What about the rule?

01:14:19.258 --> 01:14:20.717
I broke it, but don't
fall in love with me

01:14:20.738 --> 01:14:21.779
Let's go!

01:16:05.717 --> 01:16:06.717
Wait!

01:16:06.842 --> 01:16:08.408
I won't kill him.

01:17:06.217 --> 01:17:08.758
I don't know how to swim!

01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:40.966
Don't move!

01:17:41.467 --> 01:17:43.300
Stay on your knees.

01:17:48.758 --> 01:17:50.591
You will have to kill me.

01:17:51.175 --> 01:17:52.674
You think I won't?

01:17:52.675 --> 01:17:53.675
Try me!

01:18:02.467 --> 01:18:04.175
Don't be stupid!

01:18:04.383 --> 01:18:06.008
Think of Amber.

01:18:07.758 --> 01:18:09.799
Is that why you brought her?

01:18:11.967 --> 01:18:14.175
You're smarter than I thought.

01:18:25.133 --> 01:18:26.216
Get in!

01:18:58.300 --> 01:18:59.841
What are you looking at?

01:19:02.425 --> 01:19:04.508
Nothing, I just don't get it.

01:19:05.383 --> 01:19:07.758
You saving me makes me think that...

01:19:08.508 --> 01:19:10.633
there's still a possibility
to make this work.

01:19:15.758 --> 01:19:18.091
Can I be together with a thief?

01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:20.925
You haven't changed one bit.

01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:25.716
I need to find the guy
who screwed me over.

01:19:27.425 --> 01:19:29.549
Without the complete "Gaia",
he won't show himself.

01:19:29.550 --> 01:19:33.550
If he doesn't die, then
I can't live in peace.

01:19:42.008 --> 01:19:43.341
Are you okay?

01:19:44.008 --> 01:19:45.299
I'm alright...

01:19:45.424 --> 01:19:46.924
but you're in a bit of a pickle.

01:19:47.437 --> 01:19:49.145
You just became an accomplice.

01:19:58.175 --> 01:19:59.175
Hey!

01:20:01.425 --> 01:20:02.591
Hey!

01:20:03.342 --> 01:20:04.674
You alright?

01:20:04.675 --> 01:20:05.966
I'm good.

01:20:05.967 --> 01:20:07.425
Only one parachute left.

01:20:10.217 --> 01:20:12.633
Go with them, I'll follow after.

01:20:14.975 --> 01:20:16.265
I'm not going with you.

01:20:16.328 --> 01:20:18.161
Listen to me.

01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:20.425
Just let me talk to Kong.

01:20:21.206 --> 01:20:24.706
I'll figure everything out
and explain later, okay?

01:20:28.539 --> 01:20:29.830
Please go.

01:20:31.592 --> 01:20:33.141
I'll save you the trip.

01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:44.633
Zhang!

01:20:46.050 --> 01:20:50.550
Did you forget about your
uncle because of this woman?

01:20:55.834 --> 01:20:57.250
I have what you want.

01:20:57.873 --> 01:20:59.206
Hand it over.

01:20:59.342 --> 01:21:00.342
Hold on!

01:21:00.398 --> 01:21:02.564
You want the goods?
Where is the money?

01:21:09.383 --> 01:21:10.508
Hand me the goods!

01:21:10.734 --> 01:21:14.567
No, there's no turning
back if you give it to him.

01:21:17.467 --> 01:21:18.883
Come on, bring it over.

01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:23.718
He was talking to me.

01:21:25.456 --> 01:21:27.622
Red Ye!
What are you doing?

01:21:29.188 --> 01:21:30.396
He hired me first.

01:21:42.050 --> 01:21:43.758
Take her with us!

01:21:44.758 --> 01:21:45.758
Amber!

01:22:13.758 --> 01:22:15.303
Think twice before
snitching when you're in jail.

01:22:15.331 --> 01:22:17.212
I have her as leverage.

01:22:21.425 --> 01:22:24.341
Po, use spidey!

01:22:46.078 --> 01:22:48.827
Hands up!
Get down on the ground!

01:22:48.883 --> 01:22:50.216
Now!

01:22:55.094 --> 01:22:57.594
Go now, make sure you find her.

01:23:00.050 --> 01:23:01.210
- What about you?
- Just jump!

01:23:30.717 --> 01:23:33.300
Still refusing to cooperate?

01:23:39.175 --> 01:23:40.341
Five minutes.

01:23:40.342 --> 01:23:41.592
Okay.

01:23:43.508 --> 01:23:44.966
Where is "Gaia"?

01:23:46.008 --> 01:23:48.674
We know your mentor Kong has it.

01:23:49.842 --> 01:23:52.133
Go, take a break.

01:23:55.758 --> 01:23:57.091
Where is he?

01:23:58.967 --> 01:24:00.342
I don't know.

01:24:00.717 --> 01:24:02.258
But I do know how to find him.

01:24:02.717 --> 01:24:05.258
You can't get him without my help.

01:24:05.967 --> 01:24:07.217
And Amber?

01:24:13.342 --> 01:24:15.258
Let me out of here.

01:24:16.133 --> 01:24:18.133
I'll save her and take down Kong.

01:24:20.925 --> 01:24:23.175
If we lose Kong this time...

01:24:24.425 --> 01:24:26.050
he sells "Gaia".

01:24:26.425 --> 01:24:28.383
We will never find him.

01:24:28.967 --> 01:24:30.175
Never!

01:24:32.175 --> 01:24:34.008
Why should I trust you?

01:24:35.050 --> 01:24:37.341
Do you have another choice?

01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:39.258
One condition.

01:24:40.050 --> 01:24:41.716
Bring back "Gaia".

01:25:42.425 --> 01:25:43.800
The buyer is here.

01:25:44.315 --> 01:25:45.606
Keep an eye on her.

01:25:48.508 --> 01:25:49.674
Uncle Kong.

01:25:50.175 --> 01:25:51.800
I'll be there in bit.

01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:53.758
Be quick.

01:26:04.633 --> 01:26:06.508
I'm going in, you stay here.

01:26:09.592 --> 01:26:11.050
About Red Ye...

01:26:12.008 --> 01:26:14.424
So what's the plan anyway?

01:26:16.373 --> 01:26:17.664
Plan B.

01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:48.300
Hi.

01:26:51.508 --> 01:26:52.674
Tell us.

01:26:53.508 --> 01:26:54.758
Why did you side with Kong?

01:26:56.425 --> 01:26:57.841
He saved my life before.

01:26:59.088 --> 01:27:02.004
There are many things
where we have no choice.

01:28:11.391 --> 01:28:13.182
The universe depends on a balance...

01:28:15.175 --> 01:28:16.633
and we are all subject to Karma.

01:28:18.131 --> 01:28:19.214
Karma leads us to...

01:28:19.467 --> 01:28:20.883
where we are now.

01:28:21.909 --> 01:28:23.367
You wouldn't be here...

01:28:23.568 --> 01:28:25.068
without me.

01:28:27.573 --> 01:28:28.864
Five years...

01:28:29.133 --> 01:28:30.674
Have I not repaid my debt to you?

01:28:32.612 --> 01:28:35.487
There is no such thing as
"paying back" in a family.

01:28:37.349 --> 01:28:39.069
What are you planning
to pay her back with?

01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:43.287
Great.

01:28:43.414 --> 01:28:44.539
Everyone's here.

01:28:45.842 --> 01:28:47.383
It's a family reunion.

01:28:49.287 --> 01:28:52.203
Let me tell you.

01:28:53.925 --> 01:28:55.507
The Russian doll behind you...

01:28:55.508 --> 01:28:57.383
is a proximity bomb.

01:28:57.875 --> 01:28:59.541
The distance sensor...

01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:00.995
ls attached to "Gaia".

01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:03.502
Once the transaction is done...

01:29:04.383 --> 01:29:06.006
and "Gaia" gets out of a...

01:29:06.027 --> 01:29:07.087
one kilometer range...

01:29:07.108 --> 01:29:08.399
the bomb will go off.

01:29:13.023 --> 01:29:14.648
And this will be...

01:29:15.374 --> 01:29:17.874
what you repay her with.

01:29:25.328 --> 01:29:28.494
You stay here and watch them.

01:29:29.508 --> 01:29:32.883
When I give the call,
meet me downstairs.

01:29:36.092 --> 01:29:37.342
Understood.

01:30:05.882 --> 01:30:07.132
Hello!

01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:12.181
Your operation in the Czech Republic...

01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:14.466
drew a lot of heat from the cops.

01:30:14.827 --> 01:30:16.299
Don't worry.

01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:18.258
This place is safe.

01:30:18.612 --> 01:30:22.319
The original buyer from the
Middle East got cold feet.

01:30:22.351 --> 01:30:26.371
Luckily I found a new
buyer, Mr. Yelyuk.

01:30:28.401 --> 01:30:29.858
Last minute change in buyer...

01:30:29.945 --> 01:30:31.278
is not how we do business.

01:30:31.687 --> 01:30:33.516
He's fine.

01:30:33.537 --> 01:30:35.766
Mr. Yelyuk is a very rich man.

01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:38.646
He's offering 20% more.

01:30:41.070 --> 01:30:42.653
Nothing to worry about.

01:30:43.717 --> 01:30:46.217
You know what this machine does?

01:30:47.089 --> 01:30:48.964
It cuts Cannon barrels.

01:30:49.633 --> 01:30:56.468
When I was a young man,
I used to work in a factory like this.

01:30:57.453 --> 01:31:00.953
This damn thing can
cut through anything.

01:31:02.085 --> 01:31:04.960
I know you have something I want.

01:31:05.877 --> 01:31:07.543
Let's see it!

01:31:17.792 --> 01:31:19.500
I was like you.

01:31:20.393 --> 01:31:22.226
Looked up to him like a father.

01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:25.760
He sold me out five years ago.

01:31:27.886 --> 01:31:29.427
Looks like it's gonna be you this time.

01:31:31.328 --> 01:31:33.578
Save your story.

01:31:34.467 --> 01:31:36.050
I only care about money.

01:31:36.491 --> 01:31:38.032
Think about it...

01:31:38.643 --> 01:31:40.733
Why did he leave you here?

01:31:40.942 --> 01:31:42.274
You really believe
after the transaction...

01:31:42.295 --> 01:31:43.836
you will be getting your share?

01:31:44.459 --> 01:31:46.007
To him, you are one of us.

01:31:48.044 --> 01:31:50.169
Pull the trigger if
you don't believe me.

01:32:11.050 --> 01:32:12.383
Take it easy.

01:32:13.328 --> 01:32:15.244
Just family business
being taken care of.

01:32:15.883 --> 01:32:17.466
Family business...

01:32:21.717 --> 01:32:23.258
Lower your guns!

01:32:24.842 --> 01:32:26.008
Carry on. 

01:32:36.342 --> 01:32:37.675
Proceed.

01:32:46.133 --> 01:32:49.799
"Bank transfer".

01:32:50.717 --> 01:32:52.633
Hand over "Gaia"!

01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:56.591
Or I'll kill her!

01:33:19.467 --> 01:33:21.175
You shot her down like a dog.

01:33:23.976 --> 01:33:25.669
If she can't even
handle a few of you...

01:33:25.690 --> 01:33:27.148
what's the use of her?

01:33:28.951 --> 01:33:30.742
What do you take us for?

01:33:31.070 --> 01:33:32.611
What do you take me for?

01:33:33.143 --> 01:33:34.684
If I raised a dog...

01:33:34.913 --> 01:33:37.050
at least it would know how to fetch.

01:33:37.217 --> 01:33:39.300
You left me for a bitch.

01:33:39.562 --> 01:33:42.437
I have rules for training my dogs.

01:33:42.609 --> 01:33:44.692
Your rules don't apply to me.

01:33:45.146 --> 01:33:46.146
Why does it have to suit you?

01:33:46.218 --> 01:33:47.824
- Translate this to Yelyuk.
- Not necessary!

01:33:47.845 --> 01:33:49.061
Does he have a younger brother?

01:33:49.082 --> 01:33:50.174
Don't listen to him!

01:33:50.175 --> 01:33:52.439
Did his brother
disappear five years ago?

01:33:52.486 --> 01:33:54.258
- Shut up!
- Hold on!

01:33:56.050 --> 01:33:57.341
I'll listen.

01:33:57.859 --> 01:33:59.275
Five years ago...

01:33:59.745 --> 01:34:01.703
after I stole the "Eye
of the Forest" for him,

01:34:02.925 --> 01:34:04.466
I was ambushed...

01:34:05.425 --> 01:34:06.817
by a thief.

01:34:06.983 --> 01:34:09.038
He stole the "Eye of
the Forest" from me.

01:34:09.568 --> 01:34:11.443
Kong had him murdered.

01:34:12.258 --> 01:34:13.557
So what?

01:34:14.896 --> 01:34:15.937
The problem is...

01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:17.897
that thief was his brother.

01:34:18.758 --> 01:34:20.216
Would you come here if you knew?

01:34:22.675 --> 01:34:24.258
How do you know this?

01:34:24.456 --> 01:34:26.081
Kong not only killed your brother...

01:34:27.289 --> 01:34:29.122
he also cut off his tongue.

01:34:30.583 --> 01:34:32.458
His tongue had a tattoo...

01:34:32.789 --> 01:34:34.934
just like the one you
have on your neck.

01:34:38.883 --> 01:34:40.883
I didn't know he was your brother.

01:34:41.021 --> 01:34:42.957
He stole from me so I killed him.

01:34:42.978 --> 01:34:43.782
That's the rule of the game

01:34:43.803 --> 01:34:45.008
You can understand that, right?

01:34:45.029 --> 01:34:47.051
You are the one not
playing by the rules.

01:34:48.784 --> 01:34:50.534
You hired his brother...

01:34:51.055 --> 01:34:53.493
- and then you killed him.
- Shut up!

01:34:57.213 --> 01:34:58.600
How dare you shoot at me?

01:35:01.734 --> 01:35:04.192
I should be asking you that question.

01:35:13.882 --> 01:35:15.215
Listen carefully.

01:35:15.467 --> 01:35:17.550
I am risking my life to come here.

01:35:18.886 --> 01:35:20.135
You are right,

01:35:20.175 --> 01:35:22.286
Kong is the one who betrayed you.

01:35:24.862 --> 01:35:26.945
He hired the Eastern European boy...

01:35:26.966 --> 01:35:29.536
to steal the
"Eye of the Forest" from you.

01:35:46.276 --> 01:35:47.859
What are you afraid of?

01:35:48.081 --> 01:35:49.201
Shoot me!

01:36:11.175 --> 01:36:13.175
He's all yours.

01:36:17.175 --> 01:36:20.800
Remember what I said
about that machine?

01:36:21.883 --> 01:36:26.722
It cuts through anything.

01:36:30.562 --> 01:36:31.978
Spideys ready!

01:36:34.039 --> 01:36:35.122
Three...

01:36:36.300 --> 01:36:37.383
two...

01:36:38.508 --> 01:36:39.549
one...

01:37:04.851 --> 01:37:06.190
Stand still!

01:37:06.795 --> 01:37:07.795
Stand still!

01:37:09.842 --> 01:37:11.300
Come out now!

01:37:13.834 --> 01:37:15.334
Come out, you traitors!

01:37:15.550 --> 01:37:16.550
I will kill you!

01:37:17.195 --> 01:37:18.881
Hand over "Gaia" to me!

01:37:48.967 --> 01:37:50.092
Go!

01:38:14.265 --> 01:38:16.224
Stop the car!
Stop the car!

01:38:22.300 --> 01:38:23.300
"One kilometer"

01:38:33.717 --> 01:38:37.258
He was defeated by his own greed.

01:38:37.883 --> 01:38:39.591
How are we going to keep you free...

01:38:40.554 --> 01:38:42.095
from prison without "Gaia"?

01:38:59.092 --> 01:39:00.436
Why do you always do this?

01:39:00.457 --> 01:39:01.591
Keeping me in the dark.

01:39:01.592 --> 01:39:03.717
Can't you give me a heads up?

01:39:05.675 --> 01:39:06.966
I promise you...

01:39:07.326 --> 01:39:09.119
from now on, whatever I do...

01:39:09.140 --> 01:39:10.640
I'll ask you first.

01:39:12.508 --> 01:39:13.674
Ms. Li...

01:39:13.721 --> 01:39:15.346
May I kiss you?

01:39:33.533 --> 01:39:35.487
Are you out of your mind?

01:39:43.779 --> 01:39:45.487
Women are complicated.

01:39:46.409 --> 01:39:47.741
Like I said...

01:39:47.805 --> 01:39:48.596
plan B.

01:39:48.675 --> 01:39:50.133
What is plan B?

01:39:50.862 --> 01:39:53.515
Just play it by ear.

01:40:20.092 --> 01:40:23.049
"Gaia returns home".

01:40:23.050 --> 01:40:25.383
"from an unknown benefactor".

01:40:37.261 --> 01:40:37.969
Good morning.

01:40:38.009 --> 01:40:39.341
You have a package.

01:40:39.342 --> 01:40:40.342
Thank you.

01:41:48.467 --> 01:41:50.758
Come on guys!
I'm done before you.

01:41:53.008 --> 01:41:54.758
We got to give it a shake.

01:41:55.289 --> 01:41:56.497
Now what?

01:41:57.342 --> 01:41:58.633
Plan C!
