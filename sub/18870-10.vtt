00:01.434 --> 00:02.902
<i>Previously on "Being Mary Jane"...</i>

00:02.969 --> 00:04.337
I've never said this to anyone.

00:04.404 --> 00:05.739
I love you.

00:05.805 --> 00:07.307
Tell me you don't love me.

00:08.041 --> 00:10.276
If you let me walk out that door,
I'm not coming back.

00:18.385 --> 00:20.086
At the time, I really thought

00:20.153 --> 00:22.222
those Internet trolls
had destroyed my life.

00:22.288 --> 00:23.656
One day, everything changed.

00:23.723 --> 00:25.191
And what brought on the change?

00:25.258 --> 00:28.027
It started by coming on
to your show last year.

00:28.962 --> 00:30.797
I'm never gonna be in the anchor chair.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.800
<i>Ronda's too good
and I just... I can't beat her.</i>

00:33.867 --> 00:35.168
You've gotta trust me.

00:35.235 --> 00:37.604
You will be the anchor of this show.

00:49.516 --> 00:52.218
Ginger-apple with salted caramel.

00:53.386 --> 00:55.989
Okay, no, that's not it. Wait. It's...

00:56.055 --> 00:58.558
- It's burnt brown sugar.
- How would you even know that?

00:59.025 --> 01:01.294
I was gonna say chocolate
with white frosting,

01:01.361 --> 01:03.129
but I'm obviously out of my league.

01:03.196 --> 01:04.697
He said it, I didn't.

01:07.967 --> 01:10.103
<i>Mary Jane? Mary Jane?</i>

01:10.170 --> 01:12.839
Mary Jane? All right? Mary Jane!

01:12.906 --> 01:14.874
I told you not to mess with Kara.

01:14.941 --> 01:17.877
She may be small,
but she punches above her weight.

01:17.944 --> 01:19.746
And I know my girl, so...

01:19.813 --> 01:22.048
- Okay.
- Let's just see. 4 to 1.

01:22.115 --> 01:23.783
- Are you ready to give up?
- You got it.

01:23.850 --> 01:26.252
All I wanna do is celebrate
my birthday with you two,

01:26.319 --> 01:29.422
so, where are we eating this cake?

01:29.956 --> 01:32.659
- Mary Jane, my darling...
- Jesus.

01:32.725 --> 01:35.829
- My love, my sweetheart...
- Can we cut the sweet talk and get to it?

01:35.895 --> 01:36.830
Okay.

01:37.530 --> 01:38.798
Imagine.

01:38.865 --> 01:40.533
A brightly-lit marquee

01:40.600 --> 01:44.070
with the names Eddie Murphy,
Arsenio Hall and...

01:45.205 --> 01:46.239
Mary Jane Paul!

01:46.306 --> 01:49.609
Okay, wait, did you get her a role
in the remake of "Coming to America"?

01:49.676 --> 01:52.846
No, it's not a remake,
it's a comedy charity event.

01:52.912 --> 01:56.683
- You wanna get me on stage telling jokes?
- Yes. It's something you'll never forget.

01:56.749 --> 01:59.319
- Out loud?
- That's what your 40th has to be about.

01:59.385 --> 02:02.121
What she needs is what I planned.

02:02.188 --> 02:05.191
This year is the year you vowed
to make changes, right?

02:05.258 --> 02:08.695
So, I say that it's only fitting
that you celebrate your 40th

02:08.761 --> 02:11.164
by crossing something huge
off your bucket list.

02:11.231 --> 02:14.100
Kara Lynch,
did you get my girlfriend pregnant?

02:14.167 --> 02:16.436
No, I'm leaving that to you
and modern science.

02:16.503 --> 02:18.137
All right, MJ, imagine this.

02:18.204 --> 02:21.007
A long weekend at a beach house

02:21.074 --> 02:23.176
at the Obamas' favorite retreat.

02:23.243 --> 02:25.478
- You got us a place at Martha's Vineyard?
- Yes!

02:25.545 --> 02:26.713
Yes!

02:26.779 --> 02:29.983
And it comes with a very special dinner
with a very special guest...

02:30.049 --> 02:31.417
Zadie Smith.

02:31.484 --> 02:33.319
- All the way from Italy?
- Yes.

02:33.386 --> 02:36.689
Okay, I was one of the first people
in my dorm to read "White Teeth."

02:36.756 --> 02:38.358
Italy? That's not a big deal.

02:38.424 --> 02:40.360
Eddie Murphy's coming from Jersey.

02:41.027 --> 02:44.063
Please. Who cares about that?
Which one you'll choose?

02:44.130 --> 02:46.332
- Obviously, we're going to Vineyard.
- Hello!

02:46.399 --> 02:47.967
With one exception.

02:48.034 --> 02:50.770
- Okay.
- After my experience with Ronda,

02:51.471 --> 02:54.941
I think I've learned my lesson
about meeting my idols.

02:55.542 --> 02:58.478
- No Zadie Smith?
- No Zadie Smith.

02:58.545 --> 03:01.247
That's gonna make me a third wheel,
but I'm going anyway.

03:01.314 --> 03:03.950
- You know what? I can live with that.
- Okay.

03:04.017 --> 03:07.020
- Here's to turning 40.
- To turning 40.

03:07.086 --> 03:08.588
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

03:25.738 --> 03:27.774
No, I can... leave it. I got it.

03:27.840 --> 03:28.875
All right.

03:28.942 --> 03:31.044
No, you guys are all good.

03:31.110 --> 03:32.946
And, listen, just so you know,

03:33.012 --> 03:35.782
I tried to invite your family
to the Vineyard, but...

03:36.282 --> 03:38.451
Don't tell me.
You lost them somewhere around

03:38.518 --> 03:41.721
the part where you told them it'd take
a plane, a car and a ferry to get there.

03:42.388 --> 03:45.024
No, I think they have something
else in mind for you anyway.

03:45.091 --> 03:46.125
If they even remember.

03:46.192 --> 03:48.661
PJ said he's gonna bring you back
something from Dubai.

03:48.728 --> 03:50.697
Well, let's hope
it's not a sister-in-law.

03:50.763 --> 03:53.132
- I'm gonna get the coats.
- You know he's a pig.

03:54.434 --> 03:55.668
My goodness.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.404
You'll get through this,
mama, turning 40.

03:58.471 --> 04:00.306
- I can't believe it.
- Amazing, isn't it?

04:00.373 --> 04:02.809
Not a single meltdown yet,
but give it time.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.611
You should be proud of yourself.

04:04.677 --> 04:06.546
You did something that we all talk about.

04:06.613 --> 04:10.316
You changed and you're in love
with a great Black man.

04:10.383 --> 04:14.354
- Hallelujah!
- My God, you're so sentimental.

04:14.420 --> 04:16.356
This is how I know
you're missing Orlando.

04:16.422 --> 04:18.458
How can I miss him? He's all over the TV.

04:18.524 --> 04:20.893
Did you see him
on that Sports Night yesterday?

04:20.960 --> 04:24.263
- Girl, he looks terrible.
- Probably because he's missing you, too.

04:24.330 --> 04:25.398
Please.

04:25.465 --> 04:28.501
- Maybe you should reach out to him.
- No, no.

04:28.568 --> 04:30.737
Hot-blooded Latino men
don't forget. Nope.

04:30.803 --> 04:33.473
- Come on, stereotyping a little.
- I'm serious.

04:33.539 --> 04:36.743
Once you kick them to the curb,
that's it. There's no coming back.

04:36.809 --> 04:39.779
- They are very prideful.
- You know what I want for my birthday?

04:39.846 --> 04:42.749
- To turn me into a sap?
- No. For you to take a risk.

04:43.383 --> 04:44.984
Yeah. You're that bad ass

04:45.051 --> 04:47.820
that went from Atlanta
to a great job in New York,

04:47.887 --> 04:50.223
but you're a coward
when it comes to love.

04:50.757 --> 04:52.792
All right, you're making me
miss the old MJ.

04:52.859 --> 04:56.129
- She doesn't talk like this.
- Kara, you made a mistake.

04:56.195 --> 04:58.231
No, what I said still stands.

04:58.297 --> 05:00.366
Falling in love with a young athlete? No.

05:00.433 --> 05:03.302
- Heartache, misery...
- I don't care. I don't care.

05:03.369 --> 05:04.871
I don't care. Go after him.

05:05.338 --> 05:09.208
Will you please get
this drunk-ass romantic outta my house.

05:09.275 --> 05:11.511
<i>- Vete. Go.
- I'm here if you need me.</i>

05:11.577 --> 05:12.845
Out. Goodbye.

05:12.912 --> 05:15.014
I love you. Goodbye.

05:42.341 --> 05:44.911
- What's gotten you so horny?
- Do I need a reason?

05:50.583 --> 05:51.851
You're so hot.

05:56.823 --> 05:58.958
No, no, honey, we can't do this tonight.

05:59.025 --> 05:59.959
What?

06:01.327 --> 06:04.731
I've gotta make a deposit
to your fertility doctor in two days.

06:04.797 --> 06:07.567
But I'm so pleasantly buzzed.

06:09.135 --> 06:11.137
Get off. You're gonna have to...

06:12.538 --> 06:14.140
buzz away on your own.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.876
- It's just you and Nick now, I'm afraid.
- Come on.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.046
Have fun.

06:38.498 --> 06:40.299
I mean, he was clearly fouled.

06:40.366 --> 06:42.468
That official ruled it technical, but...

06:43.269 --> 06:44.537
The study's right here.

06:44.604 --> 06:46.739
The taunts and the boos
from the stands work.

06:46.806 --> 06:48.474
The refs are influenced by that.

06:48.541 --> 06:50.977
You're saying a bad call
could have gone the other way?

06:51.043 --> 06:54.213
- If you'd shout about it enough, yeah.
- There's a good segment here.

06:54.280 --> 06:58.151
Fans researching all the refs
and nerding out on individual stats.

06:58.217 --> 07:00.086
It's a story about sports stats?

07:00.153 --> 07:02.955
- Kinda, but...
- Lord, you're putting me to sleep.

07:03.022 --> 07:05.658
No, you're right.
Stats don't have much juice.

07:05.725 --> 07:08.127
Hold on.
How about we bring in those fans?

07:08.194 --> 07:09.595
Let them talk with Mary Jane

07:09.662 --> 07:12.532
and she gets them all riled up
about this lousy ref.

07:13.866 --> 07:16.269
- Now you're talking.
- Knicks fans.

07:16.335 --> 07:18.271
That's who Mary Jane'll be talking to?

07:18.337 --> 07:19.705
- Of course.
- Done.

07:20.473 --> 07:23.910
Mary Jane, Aaron,
and New York's most loyal fans.

07:29.415 --> 07:31.717
So much for getting into the boys' club.

07:31.784 --> 07:33.219
I love the way I pitch an idea

07:33.286 --> 07:35.855
and it doesn't take off until one
of the guys runs with it.

07:35.922 --> 07:37.790
Well, Justin did make it sound exciting.

07:38.224 --> 07:40.126
He just pitched it with a penis.

07:40.193 --> 07:42.228
Hey, do you mind
if I borrow her for a second?

07:50.069 --> 07:53.139
- We've gotta keep this professional.
- It won't happen again.

07:53.206 --> 07:54.640
No, great.

07:54.707 --> 07:56.342
I'm glad we're on the same page.

07:57.243 --> 07:58.845
- Okay.
- Great.

07:59.378 --> 08:02.181
Thanks for getting me on Aaron's story.

08:02.248 --> 08:05.284
- The more we get you together the better.
- Why?

08:05.351 --> 08:07.186
What I was trying to get to,
and couldn't,

08:07.253 --> 08:10.122
for various reasons was...
I still have a plan.

08:11.290 --> 08:14.093
Justin, I'm over
getting my hopes up. It's cool.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.194
Just hear me out.

08:15.728 --> 08:16.996
- Ron...
- Hi.

08:17.063 --> 08:19.198
- Your lunch.
- Right on time. Thank you.

08:20.399 --> 08:21.334
You hungry?

08:22.168 --> 08:23.236
Yeah, sure.

08:25.538 --> 08:27.840
Ronda may be a venerable journalist,

08:27.907 --> 08:30.343
but as of late,
she's been getting very sloppy.

08:30.409 --> 08:31.944
The ratings don't reflect that.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.714
That whole story with Liz
and the Internet bullying,

08:35.414 --> 08:36.616
Ronda didn't vet it.

08:38.684 --> 08:39.986
That just doesn't happen.

08:40.052 --> 08:43.823
Liz's private texts
were posted on an online gossip site.

08:43.890 --> 08:45.324
How'd they get there?

08:45.391 --> 08:47.526
The guy that hacked
her account, the co-worker.

08:47.593 --> 08:50.196
The co-worker was charged
for hacking her account,

08:50.263 --> 08:51.731
not for posting it online.

08:51.797 --> 08:53.966
- It doesn't mean he didn't.
- That's what I said.

08:54.533 --> 08:58.204
So, I wanted to just confirm
that it was him.

08:58.738 --> 09:00.439
And you found he didn't send it.

09:00.506 --> 09:02.441
Liz posted it herself.

09:02.508 --> 09:04.543
She created the online brouhaha.

09:04.610 --> 09:06.345
She was looking for a little attention.

09:07.046 --> 09:09.649
What she got was a full-on shit storm.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.717
So, her whole sob story...?

09:11.784 --> 09:13.052
It's all a lie,

09:13.119 --> 09:14.921
and by telling it on air,

09:15.388 --> 09:17.056
Ronda just signed her own pink slip.

09:17.123 --> 09:19.058
If Ronda aired a bogus story,

09:19.125 --> 09:21.460
- she's done as an anchor.
- Without a doubt.

09:22.428 --> 09:26.265
What if Garrett does like a nationwide
search to find a replacement?

09:26.332 --> 09:28.000
Well, a search would take time.

09:28.067 --> 09:30.303
And they'll need someone in the meantime.

09:30.903 --> 09:33.706
But it doesn't guarantee
that they'll choose me to take over.

09:33.773 --> 09:35.574
Well, who already has Aaron's vote?

09:35.641 --> 09:36.943
Me.

09:37.643 --> 09:38.811
There you go.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.147
Thanks for the sandwich.

09:42.248 --> 09:45.785
By the way, I asked Garrett to bring
the News Director down tomorrow.

09:45.851 --> 09:47.153
To watch my segment?

09:47.219 --> 09:50.556
If he sees you holding your own
alone with Aaron, it's a done deal.

09:50.623 --> 09:53.426
You should know by now
there's no such thing as a done deal.

09:53.492 --> 09:55.594
It's gonna work this time. All right?

09:55.661 --> 09:57.496
Just remember who made it all happen.

10:17.516 --> 10:18.517
Hey.

10:19.552 --> 10:20.519
Hey.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.421
You're up before the alarm.

10:22.488 --> 10:23.622
I am.

10:24.423 --> 10:26.759
What's gotten you energized
at 3 in the morning?

10:26.826 --> 10:30.296
Well, if all goes well today,
you might just be looking

10:30.363 --> 10:32.431
at the new co-anchor of "Great Day USA."

10:32.498 --> 10:33.899
- What?
- Yeah.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.935
- That's massive.
- I know.

10:36.002 --> 10:38.037
What happened? The house fell on Ronda?

10:38.104 --> 10:39.905
It will in a day or two, yeah.

10:39.972 --> 10:41.741
I can't believe it, but she slipped up.

10:41.807 --> 10:44.443
Justin thinks it might be enough
to get me in the chair.

10:44.510 --> 10:46.345
- Justin?
- Yeah, it was his idea.

10:46.412 --> 10:47.680
And you're gonna go with it.

10:47.747 --> 10:49.949
If you haven't learned by now,
it's either her or me.

10:52.184 --> 10:53.552
Can you put this on my back?

10:53.619 --> 10:55.287
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

10:55.955 --> 10:57.023
So...

10:57.523 --> 11:00.326
I guess this means
that Martha's Vineyard's off the table.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.461
Crap. I hadn't even thought of that.

11:02.528 --> 11:05.464
No, that's fine. Me and Kara will go.
We'll have a great time.

11:05.531 --> 11:06.966
We'll postpone it.

11:09.869 --> 11:12.738
Do you think you're possibly
diving into this too quickly?

11:12.805 --> 11:15.541
I was practically promised
the anchor chair in my interview.

11:15.608 --> 11:17.176
No, not just the job.

11:17.243 --> 11:18.310
Everything.

11:19.545 --> 11:23.115
Okay, Lee, I know it's early,
but you're not making any sense.

11:23.649 --> 11:26.118
It just occurred to me
that when we have this baby,

11:26.552 --> 11:28.654
I'll have children on two continents.

11:28.721 --> 11:29.855
An ocean apart.

11:29.922 --> 11:32.224
You're not gonna leave
New York, especially now.

11:32.291 --> 11:36.462
- Zoe and the kids won't leave the UK.
- Okay, this didn't just occur to you.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.064
This occurred to Zoe.

11:38.130 --> 11:41.934
Zoe pointed this out during dinner
'cause you guys share everything.

11:42.468 --> 11:45.805
I realized it at dinner.
But it was nothing to do with Zoe.

11:45.871 --> 11:47.306
Then what was it?

11:47.373 --> 11:49.809
When I sat across from her,
I remembered every time

11:49.875 --> 11:52.445
she would dive into things
with reckless abandon,

11:52.511 --> 11:54.046
and I'd have to pick up the pieces.

11:55.047 --> 11:57.349
I wanna make sure
I'm not falling into the same trap.

11:57.416 --> 11:58.384
Trap?

11:59.218 --> 12:00.453
Look...

12:00.519 --> 12:02.721
- If you think I'm trapping you...
- No.

12:02.788 --> 12:05.524
- We need to rethink this thing.
- It was a bad choice of words.

12:05.591 --> 12:07.993
Look, MJ, we're just talking here.
What's the matter?

12:08.060 --> 12:09.261
Okay, I'm confused.

12:09.328 --> 12:11.464
Are you saying you want
to have a baby with me?

12:11.530 --> 12:14.700
I'm saying I want you to be happy,
and if that's what it takes, then, yes.

12:14.767 --> 12:18.971
Before you, I was not above
getting pregnant by any means necessary,

12:19.038 --> 12:21.107
but now I can't go back.

12:21.574 --> 12:24.944
I don't wanna go back,
and I'm being all honest and...

12:26.078 --> 12:29.448
I want you to want it, too.

12:30.549 --> 12:32.051
You know what I'm saying?

12:32.118 --> 12:34.320
If I can't say that to you, then what?

12:34.954 --> 12:36.455
- It's over?
- Yes!

12:36.522 --> 12:38.090
- Are you kidding me?
- Damn it, MJ!

12:38.157 --> 12:40.726
Every time things don't go exactly
the way you want,

12:40.793 --> 12:42.027
you just cut and run.

12:42.094 --> 12:45.498
- Are you joking? Exactly the way I want?
- Yeah.

12:45.564 --> 12:47.867
Do you think this crap
was on my vision board?

12:47.933 --> 12:50.870
Do you think I want
your wackadoodle baby mama,

12:50.936 --> 12:54.106
your masturbating kid,
your freaking tea drinking?

12:54.173 --> 12:56.609
- Do you think that...
- But I compromise, too.

12:56.675 --> 12:58.844
Every time you fly off the handle,
I compromise.

12:58.911 --> 13:00.913
The baby conversation
is about compromise.

13:00.980 --> 13:03.182
I don't want you to compromise.

13:03.249 --> 13:05.217
I don't want you to give in to me.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.585
I don't want that.

13:06.652 --> 13:08.154
I want you...

13:08.220 --> 13:10.022
to be a man with backbone

13:10.089 --> 13:13.425
who is as passionate
about what he wants as I am.

13:13.492 --> 13:15.628
- That's what I want.
- Who are you kidding?

13:15.694 --> 13:17.796
You would run that man
and every other one away.

13:18.664 --> 13:19.665
Asshole!

13:25.938 --> 13:27.006
Well done.

13:28.407 --> 13:29.875
You can add me to the list.

13:31.210 --> 13:32.244
You know what?

13:33.145 --> 13:34.680
Good luck with your bloody job.

13:52.431 --> 13:54.333
That's good baby. That's good colors.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.734
What are you making?

13:55.801 --> 13:57.803
I'm making a car for Auntie.

13:58.737 --> 14:00.072
Isn't that something.

14:00.139 --> 14:02.808
But whose name is that?

14:02.875 --> 14:03.842
Mommy's.

14:05.077 --> 14:07.446
I thought we already
picked a gift for Pauletta.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.815
I don't know
if I'll have time to do it all.

14:09.882 --> 14:11.584
Niecy, that sounds like an excuse.

14:11.650 --> 14:15.254
The whole point is so that Pauletta
doesn't have to do it for you.

14:15.321 --> 14:18.457
- I'm gonna do it, Grandma.
- Patrick has everything all ready.

14:18.524 --> 14:19.658
Don't you, Patrick?

14:20.159 --> 14:21.927
- What's that?
- Pauletta's gift.

14:21.994 --> 14:23.395
Yeah, the iPad's here.

14:23.462 --> 14:25.364
I'll figure out
how to edit the video, too.

14:25.431 --> 14:28.033
But we should get started,
if we'll send it on her birthday.

14:28.100 --> 14:29.468
Well, Paul and I are ready.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.003
I will be, too.

14:42.248 --> 14:44.083
Justin, my man.

14:45.884 --> 14:47.987
Mary Jane gonna be ready
for those Knicks fans?

14:48.053 --> 14:49.355
She was born ready.

14:53.492 --> 14:55.494
What? Just give me a minute, please.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.096
I'm fine. I'm fine.

14:58.430 --> 15:00.299
Hey, put BBitv up on the line.

15:00.366 --> 15:02.134
<i>We're in the middle of rebuilding...</i>

15:02.201 --> 15:04.270
He's rocking a goatee now.

15:04.336 --> 15:07.406
Can we pull up the graphics
for the first segment, please?

15:08.774 --> 15:10.609
Kara, can I see you for a minute, please?

15:11.810 --> 15:12.911
Yeah.

15:17.883 --> 15:19.218
What's the matter, baby?

15:19.285 --> 15:21.020
- My God...
- What's wrong, honey? What?

15:22.554 --> 15:25.357
I'm back to where I started, just worse.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.559
Worse how, baby?
What are you talking about?

15:27.626 --> 15:30.229
You said I changed, Kara.
You did. You said I changed.

15:30.296 --> 15:31.397
- Yeah.
- But I didn't.

15:31.463 --> 15:33.499
I'm the same Mary Jane
in a different city.

15:33.565 --> 15:34.967
Okay, sweetie, listen to me.

15:35.034 --> 15:38.437
Something obviously happened with Lee,
and it's all gonna work out.

15:38.504 --> 15:39.738
Yes, it is.

15:39.805 --> 15:41.440
Come over here. Sit down.

15:41.507 --> 15:43.942
My goodness, honey, let's calm you down.

15:44.009 --> 15:45.177
No, no.

15:45.244 --> 15:46.945
Come here. Honey.

15:48.914 --> 15:50.049
Justin!

15:50.115 --> 15:52.184
Hey, I need to speak
with you and Mary Jane.

15:52.251 --> 15:53.619
She's just about to go on.

15:53.686 --> 15:56.588
You'll have to meet with her and Aaron.
I'm switching the segment.

15:56.655 --> 16:00.059
- Okay, it's a little late, isn't it?
- Well, stories get bumped all the time.

16:00.125 --> 16:02.628
- It's a breaking story.
- It was released this morning.

16:03.462 --> 16:05.097
The latest emojis.

16:05.998 --> 16:07.166
Emojis?

16:07.666 --> 16:08.901
Aren't they darling?

16:10.736 --> 16:14.306
You know, Aaron hates it when we pander
to the millennials like this.

16:14.373 --> 16:15.674
We'll have Mary Jane.

16:15.741 --> 16:17.443
He tests lowest with that demo

16:17.509 --> 16:19.678
and that's why Ronda
suggested that he cover it.

16:19.745 --> 16:21.280
- Okay.
- It'll be fun.

16:21.347 --> 16:22.848
It sounds fun.

16:22.915 --> 16:25.050
Yeah, listen.
Why don't we push it till tomorrow

16:25.117 --> 16:27.186
and that way,
it'll give us time to prepare?

16:27.252 --> 16:28.487
It'll be old news by then.

16:28.554 --> 16:30.723
The researchers
will go through the graphics.

16:30.789 --> 16:32.491
I'm sure it'll take them two minutes

16:32.558 --> 16:34.827
to get Mary Jane and Aaron
up to speed. Okay?

16:34.893 --> 16:36.261
- Okay.
- Great.

16:36.328 --> 16:38.831
Ronda, can we speak
about the next segment in my office?

16:38.897 --> 16:39.998
Sure.

16:40.065 --> 16:42.067
I thought I finally
got it right, you know?

16:42.134 --> 16:43.769
Finally.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.537
I know what this meltdown is.

16:45.604 --> 16:47.940
This thing with Lee
has been made to be much bigger

16:48.006 --> 16:49.775
because of this whole turning 40 thing.

16:50.275 --> 16:52.911
Yes, that's what it is.

16:52.978 --> 16:54.213
Look at you.

16:54.279 --> 16:56.715
You're crying over Lee.
I'm crying over Orlando.

16:56.782 --> 16:59.618
We're like two big
broken-hearted crybabies.

17:00.352 --> 17:02.988
<i>- We're viejitas.
- Yes, we're viejitas.</i>

17:03.055 --> 17:05.224
We should just go home
and listen to Adele.

17:05.290 --> 17:06.458
Baby.

17:06.525 --> 17:09.128
Tell me how long
the segment with Aaron is today.

17:09.194 --> 17:12.297
- Two minutes and thirty seconds.
- Two minutes and thirty seconds!

17:12.364 --> 17:14.967
You can do anything for two minutes
and thirty seconds.

17:15.033 --> 17:16.435
- You can hold it.
- I can't.

17:16.502 --> 17:18.570
- Yes, you can. Look at me.
- I can't.

17:19.071 --> 17:21.507
Yes, you can,
and then you can fall apart all you want.

17:21.573 --> 17:23.342
- I can?
- Yes. And guess what?

17:23.409 --> 17:24.977
I'll be here to catch you.

17:25.043 --> 17:26.845
- You promise?
- I promise.

17:26.912 --> 17:29.415
<i>All right, mamita? Okay, baby girl, yes.</i>

17:29.481 --> 17:30.949
Come on, let's get you cleaned up.

17:31.550 --> 17:34.286
Everything's gonna be fine.
I got you. Okay?

17:34.586 --> 17:37.122
It's gonna be fine.
We're gonna get you beautiful.

17:37.189 --> 17:39.925
You're gonna be great.
It's all gonna be good.

17:39.992 --> 17:43.061
Ty. Hook this up, please.
Take care of her.

17:45.597 --> 17:46.698
Hey.

17:47.566 --> 17:48.734
Is she okay?

17:50.936 --> 17:53.572
She's... looking better, right?

17:54.440 --> 17:55.808
Any idea what this is about?

17:58.610 --> 17:59.912
I wanna talk to you.

18:06.051 --> 18:09.688
I may be off base here,
but you seem to be genuinely concerned.

18:09.755 --> 18:10.722
I am.

18:11.256 --> 18:13.425
You see how hard
I've been working for her?

18:13.492 --> 18:16.528
Yeah, I have and it's been huge for her.

18:16.595 --> 18:17.629
I wanna continue.

18:22.134 --> 18:24.770
Well, she's just been through
a really huge break-up.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.672
- With the guy I just met?
- Yeah.

18:27.105 --> 18:30.576
But look at her. She's getting ready
for today's story. She'll be all right.

18:30.642 --> 18:32.144
No, that's...

18:33.078 --> 18:34.379
That's the thing.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.148
We're not doing that story anymore.

18:36.215 --> 18:37.449
What?

18:37.516 --> 18:38.650
Wait a minute.

18:39.551 --> 18:41.353
We're back up. Ready?

18:41.420 --> 18:42.688
Take one. Yeah?

18:43.956 --> 18:45.090
Two, roll.

18:45.157 --> 18:47.326
Have you ever gotten
an emoji text from Aaron?

18:47.993 --> 18:50.929
Emojis!
This is why my assistant can't spell.

18:51.563 --> 18:53.532
We are live in ten, people.

18:55.434 --> 18:58.337
The suits are here. It's outta my hands.
What do you want me to do?

18:58.403 --> 19:00.305
- Five, four...
- Pray.

19:02.841 --> 19:04.009
All right, back in 60.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.345
Mary Jane, we ran long,

19:06.411 --> 19:09.014
so when we're back
on the air you have only 90 seconds.

19:09.081 --> 19:11.617
This is one of our faves
of this year's release.

19:15.454 --> 19:17.089
Is she... waving?

19:17.155 --> 19:19.091
- Mary Jane?
- You got me.

19:19.725 --> 19:21.393
It's the "boy, bye" emoji.

19:22.561 --> 19:24.129
It's like a Beyoncé thing.

19:24.897 --> 19:25.898
<i>Sure.</i>

19:27.199 --> 19:29.401
Now, this one's a toughie.

19:31.904 --> 19:33.772
<i>It's a puck. Like a hockey puck.</i>

19:33.839 --> 19:35.007
Lord.

19:35.073 --> 19:36.208
It's a rice cracker.

19:37.609 --> 19:39.945
<i>What's... the green thing?</i>

19:40.746 --> 19:41.847
<i>Seaweed.</i>

19:42.281 --> 19:44.650
Aaron, I know you'll get this one.

19:46.652 --> 19:48.554
- I think I like this one.
- Yeah?

19:48.620 --> 19:51.356
Yeah, it's like a rained on smiley face.

19:51.423 --> 19:54.092
Like I have a smiley face
in spite of the rain.

19:55.761 --> 19:56.962
<i>Sorry, Aaron,</i>

19:57.029 --> 19:59.231
it's actually a smiley face
with a cold sweat.

20:00.332 --> 20:02.234
How is that not a raindrop?

20:02.834 --> 20:05.537
Ask them how you're supposed
to use that in a text.

20:05.604 --> 20:08.206
How useful are these emojis, Penelope?

20:08.273 --> 20:11.009
I mean, what is the circumstance
where one would use

20:11.076 --> 20:13.211
an emoji of a rice cracker?

20:13.278 --> 20:14.546
That's right.

20:14.613 --> 20:17.182
In my day, emojis meant something.

20:17.249 --> 20:20.018
A smiley face,
thumbs up, they were useful.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.555
- I think we got a pulse.
- Yeah.

20:23.622 --> 20:25.324
Get him to use the emojis.

20:25.390 --> 20:28.093
<i>Okay, quick, send a message
using these three emojis.</i>

20:29.227 --> 20:30.596
The coupon.

20:30.662 --> 20:32.431
The Russian flag.

20:33.599 --> 20:34.766
And the sweaty guy.

20:36.401 --> 20:38.770
I got a coupon
for a one-way ticket to Russia.

20:38.837 --> 20:40.305
What could possibly go wrong?

20:40.372 --> 20:41.673
Cold sweat emoji.

20:42.307 --> 20:43.575
<i>We're out of time.</i>

20:43.642 --> 20:46.211
Penelope, thank you so much
for sharing these with us.

20:46.278 --> 20:49.948
You can find more of the latest emojis
for 2017 on our website.

20:50.015 --> 20:51.083
More to come.

20:52.851 --> 20:54.953
Nice job. Fine segment, Garrett.

20:55.020 --> 20:57.589
Nice work, guys.
I knew this one would be a winner.

20:58.123 --> 20:59.725
- Good call.
- Thanks.

21:01.660 --> 21:02.794
Listen.

21:04.463 --> 21:06.198
Thanks for all your help with this.

21:06.264 --> 21:09.468
You don't have to thank me.
I'll always have Mary Jane's back.

21:13.071 --> 21:16.742
There's no way Sawyer didn't notice
the chemistry between you and Aaron.

21:16.808 --> 21:19.311
- The News Director was here?
- All of the suits were.

21:19.378 --> 21:21.780
So, I say we go in and blow the lid off

21:21.847 --> 21:24.249
Ronda's Internet bullying story
right now.

21:24.316 --> 21:25.584
Are you sure?

21:27.285 --> 21:30.956
Okay. I'll tell you what. It'll be better
you don't have your fingerprints on this.

21:31.023 --> 21:33.225
I'll do the dirty work,
you make yourself scarce.

21:33.291 --> 21:34.660
My hotel's five minutes away.

21:34.726 --> 21:36.328
- You did great tonight.
- Thanks.

21:36.395 --> 21:37.729
I'll update you.

21:41.166 --> 21:42.334
Feeling better?

21:43.368 --> 21:44.503
I think so.

21:47.673 --> 21:50.976
Letta, we wanted to do
something special for your birthday.

21:51.510 --> 21:53.712
But you already have a warm coat,

21:53.779 --> 21:55.313
expensive rain boots

21:55.380 --> 21:57.449
and an overpriced cashmere scarf, so...

22:00.652 --> 22:01.953
You know...

22:03.288 --> 22:04.890
after you left for New York,

22:05.557 --> 22:06.825
we were a little lost.

22:08.193 --> 22:11.596
But you leaving the nest
inspired us to try new things.

22:12.397 --> 22:13.999
So, for your birthday,

22:14.399 --> 22:16.668
we challenged each other
to think of ways

22:17.135 --> 22:18.837
we could live up to your example.

22:23.809 --> 22:26.745
- You deliberately went after her.
- Maybe I did some digging,

22:26.812 --> 22:29.948
but if Ronda had properly vetted
the story, there'd be nothing to find.

22:31.883 --> 22:36.054
You have proof that Liz posted
her private conversation on this website?

22:36.121 --> 22:37.522
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

22:37.589 --> 22:40.592
Ronda's the stalwart
of this show, this network.

22:40.659 --> 22:43.962
Garrett, if that were true,
she wouldn't have cut corners.

22:44.029 --> 22:46.631
I'm gonna have to go upstairs
and talk to Sawyer about this.

22:52.270 --> 22:55.207
You and Mary Jane should lay low
for the rest of the day.

22:55.907 --> 22:59.077
But don't stray too far.
Sawyer may wanna talk with you.

23:08.653 --> 23:10.188
God, finally. What happened?

23:10.255 --> 23:12.758
I didn't wanna put it all
in a text, but...

23:12.824 --> 23:13.892
Ronda's out.

23:13.959 --> 23:15.627
Garrett will call me and let me know

23:15.694 --> 23:18.663
if we need to come talk to...
the News Director.

23:19.331 --> 23:20.866
God, this is really happening.

23:20.932 --> 23:22.200
Yeah.

23:22.701 --> 23:25.170
- Do you wanna come in for a drink?
- I don't wanna impose.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.639
- No, I'm by myself. Come on. Please
- Sure? Okay.

23:31.042 --> 23:32.177
What do you drink?

23:34.913 --> 23:35.914
You know what?

23:36.348 --> 23:37.649
Do you mind?

23:37.716 --> 23:38.784
Be my guest.

23:39.251 --> 23:40.318
Okay.

23:42.788 --> 23:44.790
I didn't peg you as a mixologist.

23:46.024 --> 23:49.761
I couldn't have a conversation
with my dad without a serious drink.

23:50.395 --> 23:51.496
The car salesman?

23:51.563 --> 23:52.798
Yeah.

23:55.634 --> 23:56.868
So, you never told me.

23:56.935 --> 24:00.272
How did you figure out
that Ronda didn't vet the story?

24:00.338 --> 24:01.840
Well, in working with Ronda,

24:01.907 --> 24:04.476
I noticed a lot of things
slipping through the cracks.

24:05.177 --> 24:08.713
I started combing through everything,
looking for inconsistencies.

24:09.314 --> 24:11.950
- It must have taken weeks.
- About two months.

24:13.518 --> 24:15.620
So, you had this in your back pocket

24:15.687 --> 24:17.222
when you pitched the story.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.690
You knew she'd bite.

24:19.791 --> 24:20.992
I told you...

24:21.426 --> 24:22.460
trust me.

24:29.734 --> 24:32.571
- This is good. What is this?
- It's called an "Air Mail."

24:38.476 --> 24:41.947
So you... you must have started
planning this whole thing

24:42.013 --> 24:43.882
like, what, on the first day?

24:44.482 --> 24:45.584
No, I...

24:46.184 --> 24:49.688
I started when I realized
that you belong in that chair, not her.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.428
I should get some crackers or something.

24:56.494 --> 24:58.029
I'm allergic to gluten.

24:58.096 --> 24:59.865
- Really?
- No.

25:04.970 --> 25:06.438
No. No.

25:07.372 --> 25:10.308
No, you were like the king
of the boys' club in Atlanta.

25:10.942 --> 25:13.211
It wasn't much of a boys' club, though.

25:13.278 --> 25:15.213
It was Vlad Fredericks and Stu Isaacs.

25:15.280 --> 25:18.650
It was more of like a geek squad. True.

25:18.717 --> 25:21.853
Vlad was the one who was claiming

25:21.920 --> 25:24.122
that he and you were...

25:24.189 --> 25:25.323
No!

25:25.390 --> 25:27.959
- I didn't believe him, I didn't feel...
- You did.

25:28.026 --> 25:31.563
...you'd fall for a poser like that.
It's not in you. It's not in your style.

25:37.102 --> 25:39.771
Do you think Ronda'll figure out
a way to wriggle out of this?

25:42.674 --> 25:45.577
I think I've considered
just about every possibility.

25:47.445 --> 25:50.148
Taking into account what happened
with Dan Rather at CBS

25:50.215 --> 25:51.850
and Brian Williams at NBC,

25:51.917 --> 25:54.653
the network has no choice
but to get rid of her.

25:54.719 --> 25:57.989
And part of me kind of wishes
she does wriggle out of it.

25:58.423 --> 25:59.391
Why?

26:00.692 --> 26:03.495
I guess when I got here,
I sort of imagined her, like,

26:03.561 --> 26:08.433
me the ropes and then looking
on proudly when I did make it.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.535
So, she wasn't there to lift you up.

26:10.602 --> 26:13.805
Don't lose sight
of what you came here to do.

26:13.872 --> 26:15.640
You deserve to be in that chair.

26:18.743 --> 26:20.045
Are you hearing me?

26:20.111 --> 26:21.112
Yeah. Yes.

26:21.646 --> 26:24.249
The audiences, they liked Ronda.

26:24.749 --> 26:27.085
- Of course. She had a huge audience.
- Okay.

26:27.152 --> 26:28.486
But they're gonna love you.

26:35.560 --> 26:37.862
Garrett wants us
to meet him at the studio.

26:40.065 --> 26:41.299
We're drunk.

26:42.267 --> 26:43.768
My God, I've gotta change.

26:49.074 --> 26:53.845
<i>Aaron will be issuing a retraction
on behalf of the show tomorrow morning.</i>

26:57.349 --> 27:01.052
<i>Ronda's being placed on suspension.
Effective immediately.</i>

27:02.687 --> 27:04.656
<i>The News Director approved it.</i>

27:07.459 --> 27:11.463
<i>This means you should be ready
to co-anchor the show tomorrow.</i>

27:32.417 --> 27:34.319
- Taking it for a spin?
- Jesus!

27:35.086 --> 27:36.121
Was I drooling?

27:37.088 --> 27:39.290
- It suits you.
- Salivating over a chair?

27:39.357 --> 27:40.492
Naked ambition.

27:41.359 --> 27:43.795
Were you and Garrett watching
from the control room?

27:43.862 --> 27:45.663
- A little bit.
- Great.

27:45.730 --> 27:46.931
I'm kidding.

27:46.998 --> 27:49.434
Garrett went home, as did everyone else.

28:01.212 --> 28:03.815
Hey, I never had a chance
to thank you for...

28:04.682 --> 28:06.384
helping me get here.

28:06.818 --> 28:09.220
You don't have to thank me. We're a team.

28:26.304 --> 28:28.339
I can't. We shouldn't...

28:29.174 --> 28:30.141
Right?

28:33.278 --> 28:34.245
Right.

28:35.814 --> 28:36.781
Yeah.

30:31.963 --> 30:33.398
This is a tough one for me.

30:34.399 --> 30:37.936
I remember how I felt after helping Niecy
with that statement about the tasing.

30:38.870 --> 30:42.207
It was the first time in a long time
I felt good about what I was doing.

30:42.273 --> 30:44.742
So, when a local group
reached out to me,

30:45.944 --> 30:48.146
I accepted a role
as a community activist.

30:48.513 --> 30:51.482
Now I speak out, and attend meetings,

30:52.350 --> 30:53.818
and I plan to do more.

30:53.885 --> 30:56.387
I know this doesn't sound like much
to most people, but...

30:57.689 --> 31:00.158
I think you'll appreciate
how big this is.

31:36.427 --> 31:38.663
I've gotta hand it to you, Mary Jane.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.231
You did it, you won.

31:40.732 --> 31:43.568
You succeeded in getting
me out of the anchor chair.

31:43.635 --> 31:45.870
You got yourself
out of the anchor chair, Ronda.

31:45.937 --> 31:48.906
If you would have waited,
you could have gotten there on merit.

31:48.973 --> 31:51.409
But, instead, you did it
by discrediting me.

31:51.476 --> 31:53.111
With Justin's help, of course.

31:53.177 --> 31:55.146
I'm sorry that it went down that way.

31:55.213 --> 31:57.615
- I truly am.
- Please.

31:57.682 --> 31:59.951
You know you are as far gone as I am.

32:00.518 --> 32:02.186
It's intoxicating, isn't it?

32:02.253 --> 32:05.256
That seat. The power that it affords.

32:05.323 --> 32:08.259
A drug like that
is bound to lead to some bad choices.

32:08.326 --> 32:11.963
I don't understand how exposing
your mistake is a bad choice.

32:12.664 --> 32:13.831
Time will tell.

32:14.799 --> 32:16.367
But then again, who am I kidding?

32:16.968 --> 32:18.469
You won't have much time.

32:18.536 --> 32:20.104
This is a young person's game.

32:21.005 --> 32:23.941
By the way, happy 40th.

32:26.444 --> 32:28.313
Jealousy doesn't suit you, Ronda.

32:30.315 --> 32:31.416
Really?

32:31.816 --> 32:34.619
Getting into the anchor chair
on your birthday.

32:34.686 --> 32:35.887
That's something.

32:35.953 --> 32:39.190
I'm just so sorry that Kara
won't be here to see it.

32:39.257 --> 32:40.291
What?

32:40.358 --> 32:44.028
Please, tell her I wish her
the best of luck.

32:45.063 --> 32:47.365
I'm sure she'll land on her feet.

32:56.074 --> 32:57.442
Kara, what happened?

32:58.676 --> 33:00.378
Garrett suspended me.

33:01.112 --> 33:02.313
It's okay.

33:02.380 --> 33:04.115
We're gonna figure this out.

33:12.323 --> 33:14.359
Liz's story pre-dated you.

33:14.425 --> 33:16.361
Why would they blame you
for not vetting it?

33:17.295 --> 33:19.897
Because Ronda claimed
that as the new producer,

33:19.964 --> 33:21.933
it was my job to review it,

33:22.400 --> 33:24.035
and she's not entirely wrong.

33:24.102 --> 33:25.770
No, don't blame yourself for this.

33:25.837 --> 33:28.506
They are wrong, okay? They're wrong.

33:28.940 --> 33:30.908
I'm not taking this on all by myself.

33:30.975 --> 33:32.643
Trust me, this was Justin.

33:33.511 --> 33:35.947
I'm telling you.
Now we know for sure, Mary Jane,

33:36.013 --> 33:37.515
that he's got it out for us.

33:37.582 --> 33:41.319
He was there when Garrett
called me in the room.

33:41.386 --> 33:43.421
- When they suspended you?
- Yes.

33:44.155 --> 33:46.724
Yes, Mary Jane,
he dug up this whole story.

33:46.791 --> 33:48.826
He plotted this whole thing.

33:49.627 --> 33:51.963
I'm telling you.
You'd better watch your back.

33:52.630 --> 33:55.299
I've been trying to tell you that
and you don't wanna hear it.

33:55.366 --> 33:56.467
No.

33:58.169 --> 33:59.437
What am I gonna do?

34:00.505 --> 34:01.806
We're gonna fix it.

34:02.373 --> 34:04.609
Okay? We're gonna fix it.

34:06.277 --> 34:08.212
Yeah, we can move that segment up.

34:08.780 --> 34:10.982
I'll meet you
in the editing room in three.

34:11.048 --> 34:14.185
Damn you, Justin!
When you laid out your master plan,

34:14.252 --> 34:16.654
you left out the part
that Kara was collateral damage.

34:16.721 --> 34:18.723
I didn't know Ronda was gonna do that.

34:18.790 --> 34:22.260
You masterminded this whole thing!
You'll tell me you didn't see it coming?

34:22.326 --> 34:24.095
Listen.

34:24.162 --> 34:26.864
No, no, wait.
Was last night a part of your plan?

34:26.931 --> 34:29.534
- You screw her and then me?
- That's not what that was.

34:31.569 --> 34:33.538
I'm only in New York because of Kara.

34:34.539 --> 34:35.706
She looked after me.

34:35.773 --> 34:38.509
Maybe I should have seen it coming,
but I didn't and I'm sorry.

34:42.046 --> 34:43.214
Mary Jane?

34:53.791 --> 34:55.793
All right, time's run out.
It's now or never.

34:56.527 --> 34:59.363
- Okay, Dad, I...
- Come on. No more excuses.

34:59.430 --> 35:01.933
- I said okay.
- Okay.

35:02.967 --> 35:05.636
- At least let me straighten up.
- Go on.

35:07.004 --> 35:08.005
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

35:08.673 --> 35:09.974
Hey, Auntie.

35:10.041 --> 35:11.909
It's me, obviously.

35:13.211 --> 35:16.280
After everything that happened
with the settlement, and Dante,

35:16.848 --> 35:19.116
I realized that I needed
to get on my own two feet.

35:19.183 --> 35:21.686
So, I got a booth at Claudia's Salon.

35:22.687 --> 35:25.456
I don't have my license yet,
but I'm working on it.

35:25.523 --> 35:30.394
And Dante's baby mama, Amika, and I,
have worked out a babysitting share,

35:30.461 --> 35:32.396
so we'll both have time to go to school.

35:32.864 --> 35:34.799
You know, I've only got 15 hours in,

35:34.866 --> 35:38.302
but, hey, it's a start
and I'm gonna stick it out.

35:38.369 --> 35:39.704
Just like you taught me.

35:40.171 --> 35:41.472
I promise.

35:41.539 --> 35:42.673
Love you.

35:44.375 --> 35:45.710
How was that?

35:46.244 --> 35:47.378
That was perfect.

35:50.882 --> 35:51.849
Hey.

35:55.453 --> 35:57.822
I had to bribe a PA
to let me wait in here for you.

35:57.889 --> 35:59.323
Lee, I'm sorry, I...

35:59.390 --> 36:01.792
Now's not the time or place
to discuss this, I get it.

36:03.728 --> 36:04.862
We can work this out.

36:08.733 --> 36:09.967
Mary Jane?

36:10.568 --> 36:11.636
Ty's ready for you.

36:12.703 --> 36:14.372
- I've gotta go.
- MJ, look...

37:30.615 --> 37:32.783
<i>I know this is a non-traditional
birthday gift,</i>

37:32.850 --> 37:36.087
<i>but we thought you'd appreciate us
trying to make you proud for a change.</i>

37:36.153 --> 37:37.421
Is that from your family?

37:37.955 --> 37:39.490
Yeah, it's my birthday.

37:39.557 --> 37:40.725
Happy Birthday.

37:41.092 --> 37:44.629
<i>We thought we'd step out
of our comfort zone.</i>

37:45.396 --> 37:48.199
<i>That's right, and Helen and I
got in on it, too.</i>

37:49.900 --> 37:51.035
That's so sweet.

37:51.102 --> 37:55.072
<i>It may not sound as brave
to go back to where you came from,</i>

37:55.139 --> 37:58.376
<i>but your father has agreed</i>

37:58.442 --> 38:01.345
<i>- to visit Hattiesburg with me.
- Yep.</i>

38:01.412 --> 38:03.614
<i>I haven't been there
in more than 40 years!</i>

38:03.681 --> 38:05.416
<i>- Ain‘t that right baby?
- Yep, yep.</i>

38:05.483 --> 38:07.985
<i>I wasn‘t keen on Mississippi,</i>

38:08.052 --> 38:12.256
<i>but Helen moved with me
to Atlanta and never looked back.</i>

38:12.323 --> 38:15.326
<i>So I owed her a chance of closure.</i>

38:16.360 --> 38:18.162
Has your family done this thing before?

38:18.229 --> 38:19.664
No, never.

38:20.698 --> 38:22.099
Really stepping it up.

38:22.166 --> 38:23.834
<i>And I have one more thing to say.</i>

38:23.901 --> 38:29.340
<i>I didn‘t want to admit that your move
to New York was a good thing,</i>

38:29.407 --> 38:32.443
<i>but once you came home
I could see that...</i>

38:32.510 --> 38:35.513
<i>well, it was what you needed to do
to turn things around.</i>

38:35.579 --> 38:37.515
<i>So, baby girl.</i>

38:37.581 --> 38:42.453
<i>This is truly your year
to achieve all your dreams.</i>

38:42.520 --> 38:44.021
<i>I see it,</i>

38:44.088 --> 38:46.490
<i>and we can‘t be happier.</i>

38:46.557 --> 38:47.892
<i>- That‘s right.
- Yeah.</i>

38:47.958 --> 38:49.326
<i>So happy!</i>

38:49.393 --> 38:50.394
<i>Come on, Pat.</i>

38:52.063 --> 38:54.832
<i>Happy Birthday, auntie!</i>

38:54.899 --> 38:56.267
<i>We love you.</i>

38:56.333 --> 38:58.202
Mary Jane, we‘re ready for you.

39:21.325 --> 39:22.827
Let me check that mic.

39:23.894 --> 39:25.329
- Yeah, looks good.
- Thanks.

39:27.064 --> 39:28.532
Okay. Are you ready?

39:30.534 --> 39:32.002
I‘m not the enemy here.

39:32.970 --> 39:34.405
I want you to listen to me.

39:35.673 --> 39:37.141
Forget about last night.

39:37.742 --> 39:39.343
This morning, everything.

39:40.111 --> 39:41.512
This is your moment.

39:42.346 --> 39:44.148
All right? It‘s your time to shine.

39:45.816 --> 39:46.784
Hey...

40:10.508 --> 40:13.043
In five, four...

40:16.447 --> 40:19.049
Good morning.
Welcome to "Great Day USA."

40:19.116 --> 40:20.384
I'm Mary Jane Paul.
