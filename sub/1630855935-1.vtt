- Irresponsible?
- Absolutely.

They spent what?

00:40.457 --> 00:43.251
A trillion dollars plus
countless man hours,

not to mention
political capital,

00:45.045 --> 00:47.881

from Mars.

00:47.922 --> 00:50.175
- Political capital?
It united the world.

00:50.216 --> 00:52.844
- Yeah, for a hot second,
but what if they failed?

00:52.886 --> 00:54.346
Everyone would have been

00:54.387 --> 00:56.181
you know there are
people dying here, right?

charity--

01:09.944 --> 01:11.196
the ones that are actually
gonna save lives

are the ones that clean
water and give out

01:12.739 --> 01:14.032
medicine and stuff, right?

01:14.074 --> 01:15.909
- Matt Damon's charity
literally cleans water.

01:15.950 --> 01:17.577

administrative costs,

01:17.619 --> 01:20.163

actually die without help,

01:20.205 --> 01:22.290
that works out to
1,200 bucks per life.

is, you take a trillion

01:24.125 --> 01:26.753

and you can save

01:26.795 --> 01:31.966

12:46.933 --> 12:49.978
- It's really--it's just
a little scratch.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.062
Ah!

12:51.104 --> 12:52.605
That's not a scratch.

12:52.647 --> 12:55.275
- It was just
the freaking tool cart.

12:55.316 --> 12:56.568
- Look, you need
some antibiotics.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.653
- No, we only have
one course left.

12:58.695 --> 13:01.072
I am not using it
on this little cut.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.866
- Well, what if
the infection spreads?

13:02.907 --> 13:04.617
- People don't die
from little cuts.

13:04.659 --> 13:06.161
- Yeah, because
they use antibiotics.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.704
- It's fine.

13:12.042 --> 13:15.462
[soft music]

13:15.503 --> 13:17.422
- So you were saying?

13:17.464 --> 13:18.923
- What?

13:18.965 --> 13:22.260
- You were saying why we
shouldn't do sex on each other.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.970
- Oh.

13:24.012 --> 13:30.268
- Well, number one,
I'm not attracted to you.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.437
- [laughs]

13:32.479 --> 13:35.440
That's an argument for,
not against.

13:35.482 --> 13:36.775
- How?

13:36.816 --> 13:38.735
- Because if we were
attracted to each other,

13:38.777 --> 13:41.821
then "banging" could possibly
turn into something

13:41.863 --> 13:42.906
and it would get messy.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.199
- Super messy.
- Right.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.950
So the fact that you're
not attracted to me

13:45.992 --> 13:48.161
is a benefit because
we don't have to worry

13:48.203 --> 13:49.662
about getting messy.

13:49.704 --> 13:50.872
Quick pinch.

13:50.914 --> 13:52.165
- Ow!

13:54.542 --> 13:56.503
So wait.

13:56.544 --> 13:59.172
You are not attracted
to me, either?

13:59.214 --> 14:00.799
- Absolutely not.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.133
[scoffs]

14:02.175 --> 14:03.885
- Okay.

14:03.927 --> 14:05.470
- Do you want me to be?
- No.

14:05.512 --> 14:08.181
Obviously, not.

14:08.223 --> 14:10.475
I'm just surprised
this is the first time

14:10.517 --> 14:13.603
us "banging"
has occurred to you.

14:13.645 --> 14:16.856
- I didn't say that.

14:16.898 --> 14:18.983
You've never thought about it?

14:19.025 --> 14:23.196
- I mean, you have the only
penis for a million miles.

14:23.238 --> 14:25.323
- See?

14:25.365 --> 14:27.283
There you go.

14:28.743 --> 14:32.789
So let's keep this
dry and clean.

14:32.831 --> 14:37.627
And if it starts to hurt,
you let me know ASAP.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.630
Okay?

14:40.672 --> 14:41.840
- Yep.

14:44.259 --> 14:48.471
So was this a debate, or are
you making a formal proposal?

14:48.513 --> 14:51.391
- Ah, it's a debate.

14:51.433 --> 14:52.434
- [laughs]

14:52.475 --> 14:53.685
- Unless I'm convincing you,

14:53.727 --> 14:55.186
then we definitely
should do it.

14:57.522 --> 14:59.024
- My point still stands.

14:59.065 --> 14:59.983
- How so?

15:00.025 --> 15:02.318
- Well, we're not
attracted now,

15:02.360 --> 15:03.653
but if we started having sex,

15:03.695 --> 15:07.032
even if we just said
it was "banging,"

15:07.073 --> 15:09.868
our hormones
would eventually take over

15:09.909 --> 15:11.202
and we would
emotionally attach.

15:11.244 --> 15:14.372
- And when you say attach,
you mean fall in love?

15:14.414 --> 15:16.082
- Sure.

15:16.124 --> 15:18.668
That's the whole reason why
arranged marriages work.

15:18.710 --> 15:20.378
Maybe you think
the other person's gross

15:20.420 --> 15:22.881
when you meet them, but your
brain knows you're stuck.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.382
Biology takes over.

15:24.424 --> 15:25.967
- You're such a romantic.

15:26.009 --> 15:27.719
- Dude, it's science.
You are a scientist.

15:27.761 --> 15:29.846
- Yeah, and as a scientist,
I can point out

15:29.888 --> 15:32.349
all sorts
of evolutionary benefits

15:32.390 --> 15:34.142
to emotional connection.

15:34.184 --> 15:37.312
But that doesn't mean I think
love is a chemical reaction.

15:37.354 --> 15:39.481
No, not at all.

15:39.522 --> 15:41.066
People are meant
to be together.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.943
And it has nothing to do with
scent or a primal instinct

15:43.985 --> 15:49.032
or unavoidable circumstances,
it's just...

15:49.074 --> 15:53.286
I don't know, they just, like,
belong together, you know?

15:55.205 --> 15:57.374
- Oh, sorry.
Is this--is this on?

15:57.415 --> 15:58.583
Okay.
[clears throat]

15:58.625 --> 16:00.085
Lame.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.211
Can I get a lame?

16:01.252 --> 16:04.673
Uh, yes, because we are
all just robots.

16:04.714 --> 16:06.383
- Yeah, and by your logic,
it doesn't matter

16:06.424 --> 16:10.261
if we have sex or not,
because we're emotionally

16:10.303 --> 16:13.723
attached anyhow, because our
monkey brains will tell us

16:13.765 --> 16:15.433
that's our best chance
at survival.

16:15.475 --> 16:19.020
- Or one of us kills
the other to gain full control

16:19.062 --> 16:21.398
over our limited resources.

16:24.693 --> 16:26.319
- What's number two?

16:26.361 --> 16:28.613
- Reason number two.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.031
We're both married.

16:31.950 --> 16:34.869
[bell dings]

16:34.911 --> 16:36.996
- Like I was saying, I don't
see what the problem is.

16:37.038 --> 16:39.207
- You don't think the fact
that we're both married

16:39.249 --> 16:41.251
should have an impact
on whether we sleep together?

16:41.292 --> 16:42.794
- I mean, granted,
I haven't read

16:42.836 --> 16:44.254
my marriage license in a while,

16:44.295 --> 16:46.923
but I'm sure
being adrift in space

16:46.965 --> 16:49.467
with no hope of rescue
gives you a hall pass.

16:49.509 --> 16:53.346
- Okay, first of all, there's
not no possibility of rescue.

16:53.388 --> 16:56.975
- We literally talked
about this yesterday.

16:57.017 --> 16:59.644
- That was two weeks ago.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.730
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.773
- Man, time out here
is whacked.

17:03.815 --> 17:06.317
- Look, maybe we don't
get saved,

17:06.359 --> 17:08.945
but I, for one,
still think we can fix this.

17:08.987 --> 17:11.239
- Ah, how's that
working out for you?

17:11.281 --> 17:12.782
- You know,
I'm so glad you asked,

17:12.824 --> 17:15.368
because it would be better
if someone helped.

17:15.410 --> 17:17.537
- There are hundreds
of wires over there.

17:17.579 --> 17:20.540
That means there's billions
of possible combinations.

17:20.582 --> 17:23.460
It's a waste of time.

17:23.501 --> 17:26.171
- What else
am I supposed to be doing?

17:28.631 --> 17:30.675
Okay. You have a hall pass.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.218
I don't want one.

17:32.260 --> 17:35.180
- What, because your brain
chemically reacts with Todd's?

17:35.221 --> 17:37.891
Tom and I have been
together since college

17:37.932 --> 17:39.851
and we are very committed
to each other.

17:39.893 --> 17:43.897
- And how much of that time did
you spend deployed or in space?

17:43.938 --> 17:46.941
- What has that got to do
with anything?

17:46.983 --> 17:48.526
I had a job to do.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.737
- Okay. All right. Sorry.

17:53.156 --> 17:56.785
- And are you seriously going
to claim to love Atlanta...

17:56.826 --> 17:58.036
- Savannah.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.662
- More than I love Tom,
while you are

17:59.704 --> 18:01.331
begging me to cheat with you?

18:01.373 --> 18:03.458
- I'm not begging you
to do anything.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.835
This is a debate between
friends to pass time.

18:05.877 --> 18:12.842

18:12.884 --> 18:14.052
Okay, flip them.

18:14.094 --> 18:16.721
- Both?
- Yep.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.849

Testing comms.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.242
- Error.

18:37.283 --> 18:40.203
Please contact your nearest
NASA representative.

18:40.245 --> 18:41.871
- Test fail.

18:41.913 --> 18:43.081
- Mm.

18:46.084 --> 18:49.421
Why didn't they just label
these goddamn wires?

18:51.840 --> 18:54.009
- How's your cut doing?
- It's fine.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.430
- You know what
you wanna watch tonight?

18:58.471 --> 18:59.639
[groans]

18:59.681 --> 19:02.225
- I don't know.
Something upbeat?

19:02.267 --> 19:04.310
- "Princess Bride"?
- Ugh.

19:04.352 --> 19:05.770
- Huh? What?

19:05.812 --> 19:06.938
- I've watched it, like,
a thousand times.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.107
- Well, let's watch it 1,001.
It works.

19:09.149 --> 19:11.693
- Plus you always spend
the whole next day all...

19:11.735 --> 19:14.404
- Hello.
My name is Inigo Montoya.

19:14.446 --> 19:18.700
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.

19:18.742 --> 19:20.243
[chicken clucks]

19:20.285 --> 19:22.495
I'm really not seeing
the problem here.

19:22.537 --> 19:26.541
- Can we please just try
something different?

19:26.583 --> 19:29.711
I have, like, ten movies
we haven't watched at all yet.

19:29.753 --> 19:30.962
- Okay, all right. Okay.

19:31.004 --> 19:33.882
- Great. Thank you.

19:33.923 --> 19:36.384
[clears throat]

19:36.426 --> 19:39.387
Ooh, "Alien"?

19:39.429 --> 19:40.847
- Never seen it.

19:42.724 --> 19:43.975
- You have never seen "Alien"?

19:44.017 --> 19:45.518
- I've never seen it, no.

19:45.560 --> 19:52.067
- Bro, you are in
for a serious treat.

19:52.108 --> 19:53.693
[chuckles]
Oh, my God.

19:53.735 --> 19:55.487
- Sweet. Okay.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.203
[whispering]
Oh, Sigourney Weaver.

20:03.244 --> 20:04.496
- [whispering]
I know.

20:13.463 --> 20:15.965

did we watch that movie?

20:21.429 --> 20:23.306
Can you walk me
to the bathroom?

- Ha?

20:41.533 --> 20:43.451
- What are you doing?

20:43.493 --> 20:46.579
- Sleeping.
- You didn't hear me call you?

20:46.621 --> 20:48.957
I'm scared.

20:48.998 --> 20:51.876
And I don't think
the girls can protect me,

20:51.918 --> 20:55.005
so I think I'ma just
sleep in here?

20:55.046 --> 20:57.465
- Whatever. Just stop talking.

20:57.507 --> 20:58.967

- So those squishy
round thingamabobs

21:52.187 --> 21:54.105
that were pressed
against my chest, I guess--

21:54.147 --> 21:56.107
- Yeah, yep, my boobs.

21:56.149 --> 21:58.109
- [chuckles]

21:58.151 --> 22:01.863
- Um, when you came in,
I may have forgotten

22:01.905 --> 22:05.617
my general lack of clothing.

22:05.658 --> 22:06.576
- Yeah.

22:11.039 --> 22:14.834
- Are you feeling better
after--

about the other morning.

23:23.820 --> 23:26.823
- How you squished
your boobs against me.

23:26.865 --> 23:28.992
- Yeah.
- Okay.

23:29.034 --> 23:31.619
- It was pretty great, right?

23:31.661 --> 23:32.620
- Okay.

23:32.662 --> 23:33.705
Come on, let me
look at your leg.

23:33.747 --> 23:34.789
Come on.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.626
Look at that.
- Told you.

23:38.668 --> 23:39.919
- Yeah.

23:39.961 --> 23:42.297
It's 'cause of my mad
hydrogen peroxide skills.

23:42.339 --> 23:45.175
- So, like, from a mental
health perspective,

skin on skin contact
is crazy good for you.

23:55.310 --> 23:57.979
of telling me you wanna
naked cuddle more?

23:58.021 --> 24:00.482

[clears throat]

24:00.523 --> 24:01.858
What are your thoughts?

24:01.900 --> 24:04.444
- Well, I'm just surprised
that you're so willing

24:04.486 --> 24:06.321
to cede the moral high ground.

24:06.363 --> 24:09.491
- Moral high ground?
It's a mental health issue.

24:09.532 --> 24:13.119
- For you, but it's
a stress relief issue for me.

24:13.161 --> 24:16.498
So if we get
to cuddle naked, then I--

24:16.539 --> 24:19.959
- So, like, cuddling is on the
same sliding scale as banging?

24:20.001 --> 24:21.252
- I'm glad you agree.

24:21.294 --> 24:22.587
- So we shouldn't do either?

24:22.629 --> 24:25.590
- That's not where
I expected that to go.

24:25.632 --> 24:26.591
- Sorry.

24:28.218 --> 24:29.719
- Shall we?

24:38.269 --> 24:41.189
[upbeat salsa music]

24:41.231 --> 24:48.363
* *

24:55.328 --> 24:58.206
- [singing in Spanish]

24:58.248 --> 25:05.380
* *

26:01.102 --> 26:04.064
- [gasps] We haven't discussed
reason number three.

26:04.105 --> 26:05.857
- What's three?

26:05.899 --> 26:07.275
- You could knock me up.

26:07.317 --> 26:08.443
[gasps]

26:12.364 --> 26:14.199
- So you don't have
birth control?

26:14.240 --> 26:18.078
- Well, I had an IUD, but it
was giving me weird cramps,

26:18.119 --> 26:21.331
so Benson removed it from me

26:21.373 --> 26:23.124
before the, you know...

26:23.166 --> 26:25.960
both: The crazy.
- Yeah.

26:26.002 --> 26:28.880
There's no condoms
or Plan B in Medical?

26:28.922 --> 26:31.299
- Amazingly,
the government didn't send

26:31.341 --> 26:33.510
three married astronauts
into space

26:33.551 --> 26:35.845
with a supply of condoms.

26:35.887 --> 26:37.305
- Bad planning.

26:37.347 --> 26:41.893
- No, it's like the gray wire
situation all over again.

26:41.935 --> 26:42.894
- Totally.

26:47.107 --> 26:49.609
Let's just say, like,
for argument's sake,

26:49.651 --> 26:52.320
you did get knocked up,

26:52.362 --> 26:54.572
would it be that bad?

26:54.614 --> 26:56.408
I said for argument's sake.

26:58.785 --> 27:03.123
- You want to raise a child
adrift in space?

27:03.164 --> 27:05.458
- It's beautiful out here.

27:05.500 --> 27:07.752
All of our life support
and food sources

27:07.794 --> 27:10.839
are self-sustainable.
We have movies.

27:10.880 --> 27:13.591
- [scoffs]
- What kid doesn't like space?

27:13.633 --> 27:15.802
- So you're losing your mind.

27:18.638 --> 27:23.685
- I didn't wanna say it,
but it should be mentioned.

27:23.727 --> 27:25.687
As long as we've been out here
with all the radiation,

27:25.729 --> 27:27.939
you're probably sterile anyway.

27:31.776 --> 27:34.070
[object clatters]
What?

27:34.112 --> 27:36.156
- [scoffs]

27:36.197 --> 27:39.617
You're such a jerk.

27:39.659 --> 27:41.786
- I told you
I didn't wanna say it!

27:41.828 --> 27:44.414
- [whispering]
I mean, can you believe it?

27:44.456 --> 27:46.416
All the man can
think about is sex.

27:46.458 --> 27:49.127
And before you say anything,
yes, obviously,

27:49.169 --> 27:50.962
I think about it too.

27:51.004 --> 27:53.840
Did I turn four different
electric drills into vibrators?

27:55.342 --> 27:57.344
[drill whirring]

27:57.385 --> 27:59.304
That was more about innovation.

27:59.346 --> 28:02.140
[curious music]

28:02.182 --> 28:04.100
[sighs]

28:04.142 --> 28:07.145
You've gotta be
rational about it, you know?

28:07.187 --> 28:11.483
He's like my big brother
and my little sister.

28:11.524 --> 28:13.777
Yo, and he's kind
of like my dog.

28:15.111 --> 28:16.571
[laughs]
Am I really supposed to believe

28:16.613 --> 28:18.490
that he's not into this?

28:18.531 --> 28:20.450
Really? Come on.
[laughs]

28:20.492 --> 28:24.204
- And all these quote, unquote,
"reasons" she's throwing out

28:24.245 --> 28:26.998
is complete BS.

28:27.040 --> 28:28.792
And even if we did
make it home,

28:28.833 --> 28:31.753
which we're not, by the way...

28:33.880 --> 28:36.758
There's no way Savannah
wouldn't understand that.

28:40.053 --> 28:42.597
Yeah, I think
about it every day.

28:42.639 --> 28:44.140
- Work is good.

28:44.182 --> 28:46.059
Not to brag,
but I am kind of rocking

28:46.101 --> 28:47.477
this whole mayor thing.

28:47.519 --> 28:49.187
I got the funding for the
universal lunch program,

28:49.229 --> 28:51.398
so yay.

28:54.150 --> 28:57.654
I don't like that
I'm living without you,

28:57.696 --> 28:59.030
but I'm proud of you.

28:59.072 --> 29:01.116
I'm proud of you,
and I'm proud of me.

29:03.243 --> 29:05.787
Oh, and I may have killed
that fern in the kitchen,

29:05.829 --> 29:08.373
so you should probably
get back

29:08.415 --> 29:09.624
because you're the only one

29:09.666 --> 29:12.252
with the green thumb
around here.

29:12.293 --> 29:14.087
Even the plants miss you.

29:16.715 --> 29:19.843
- I'd be devastated
if she waited for me.

29:21.928 --> 29:24.097
She deserves better than that.

29:29.102 --> 29:32.105
- Hi.
Hey, how's it going up there?

29:32.147 --> 29:35.525
Are you going nuts
on that tiny little shuttle?

29:35.567 --> 29:37.068
So many questions.

29:37.110 --> 29:39.612
- Tom would love it up here.
[laughs]

29:39.654 --> 29:41.156
Are you kidding me?

29:41.197 --> 29:44.034
Sitting around watching
movies every night,

29:44.075 --> 29:46.161
it's like his heaven.

29:46.202 --> 29:50.915
I was always like,
let's go for a hike,

29:50.957 --> 29:54.294
let's try a new restaurant
or take a road trip.

29:54.336 --> 29:58.173
- I did screw up
the universal remote again,

29:58.214 --> 30:01.551
and now the sound
of the TV doesn't work.

30:01.593 --> 30:03.094
That's gonna have to wait.

30:03.136 --> 30:04.846
- I think he was hoping
this mission

30:04.888 --> 30:06.931
would be, like,
my ultimate adventure,

30:06.973 --> 30:12.479
and then I would come home
and finally be able to just...

30:14.272 --> 30:15.815
Be.

30:15.857 --> 30:18.943
- All right, I love you,
and I can't wait to see you.

30:18.985 --> 30:21.237
Have a blast.
[smooches]

30:21.279 --> 30:24.032
- End of message.

30:24.074 --> 30:26.826
- Hi.
How's it going up there?

30:26.868 --> 30:29.454
Are you going nuts
on that tiny little shuttle?

30:29.496 --> 30:32.999
[sentimental music]

30:33.041 --> 30:34.668
* *

30:34.709 --> 30:36.628
- My very last Pop-Tart.

30:36.670 --> 30:43.802
* *

30:48.556 --> 30:49.724
Mmm.

30:55.271 --> 30:59.067
We add that to the list
of things I'll never do again.

31:07.200 --> 31:10.829
- If he could see me now...
[laughs]

31:18.211 --> 31:19.170
Shut up.

31:21.172 --> 31:22.757
I need some music.

31:29.723 --> 31:33.977
[player sputtering]

31:34.019 --> 31:34.978
- Uh-oh.

31:40.066 --> 31:40.984
Uh-oh.

31:45.864 --> 31:48.074
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

31:52.078 --> 31:53.955
- [blowing]

31:56.291 --> 31:57.500
-Uh-oh.

31:57.542 --> 31:59.127
- No.

31:59.169 --> 32:00.587
[blows]

32:07.177 --> 32:10.221
[tense music]

32:10.263 --> 32:12.390
* *

32:12.432 --> 32:13.600
Adam!

32:13.641 --> 32:16.394
- You hurt yourself?
- Um...

32:16.436 --> 32:17.562
it's just so weird.

32:17.604 --> 32:22.025
I can't--my music's
not working.

32:22.067 --> 32:22.984
- Let me see it.

32:30.700 --> 32:32.577
Oh.

32:32.619 --> 32:34.287
[blows]
- I tried that.

32:40.126 --> 32:41.419
- Oh, no.

32:41.461 --> 32:42.754
Don't say that. What?

32:44.631 --> 32:48.885
- It says the root file
for your music is corrupted.

32:48.927 --> 32:50.220
- Okay, well, fix it.

32:50.261 --> 32:53.306
- Well, that was--I mean--
- [sniffs] Fix it.

32:53.348 --> 32:54.307
Okay.

32:59.437 --> 33:00.605
I'm so sorry.
- [gasps]

33:00.647 --> 33:01.898
- No, no. Come on.

33:01.940 --> 33:03.149
- I don't think I can do this.

33:03.191 --> 33:06.277
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

33:06.319 --> 33:09.364
- I still have my music, right?
You like Sinatra, right?

33:09.406 --> 33:10.657
Garth Brooks?

33:10.699 --> 33:13.576
- [sobbing] No, I can't
listen to your music.

33:13.618 --> 33:15.829
Your music sucks!
- No. [stammering]

33:15.870 --> 33:17.622
I mean,
you like Kenny Rogers, right?

33:17.664 --> 33:19.290
- What?
- You like Eminem?

33:19.332 --> 33:22.293
- [whimpers]
- Who's your favorite singer?

33:22.335 --> 33:23.837
- Um.

33:23.878 --> 33:25.171
Lionel Richie.

33:25.213 --> 33:26.840
- Lionel Richie.
Good, good, good, good, good.

33:26.881 --> 33:29.092
What's your favorite
Lionel Richie song?

33:29.134 --> 33:32.303
- "All Night Long."
- "All Night Long," okay.

33:32.345 --> 33:33.304
Here we go.

33:36.641 --> 33:38.518
Whoa.

33:38.560 --> 33:39.519
- Doesn't work.

33:39.561 --> 33:41.980
- * Whoa *

33:42.022 --> 33:44.983
* Well, my friends,
the time has come *

33:46.943 --> 33:50.447
* To raise the roof
and have some fun *

33:50.488 --> 33:54.117
* Throw away your work
to be done *

33:54.159 --> 33:55.326
Come on.

33:55.368 --> 33:58.747
* Let the music
play on, play on *

34:00.206 --> 34:04.002
* Everybody sing,

34:29.152 --> 34:31.321

34:31.363 --> 34:34.157

34:34.199 --> 34:35.492

34:35.533 --> 34:38.912

you can't sit down *

34:38.953 --> 34:42.874
[Lionel Richie's
"All Night Long"]

34:42.916 --> 34:45.043
- My name is Inigo Montoya.

34:45.085 --> 34:47.003
You killed my father.

34:47.045 --> 34:50.382
Prepare to die.
[chuckles]

Hey!

35:11.611 --> 35:13.405

35:25.834 --> 35:28.503
- This might be
your best work yet.

35:28.545 --> 35:30.046
- Thank you.

35:30.088 --> 35:32.048
- You know what you want?

35:32.090 --> 35:33.299
- I don't know.
[exhales]

35:33.341 --> 35:38.096
Just something cool right here.

35:38.138 --> 35:40.640
Who's your favorite,
me or Adam?

35:40.682 --> 35:43.476
[laughs]
I know what's the answer.

35:43.518 --> 35:45.020
[whispering]
And I won't tell him.

35:45.061 --> 35:46.479
Okay, I won't tell him.

35:46.521 --> 35:48.023
Are you juggling our eggs?

35:48.064 --> 35:50.859
Feed the input
and output for me, please.

35:52.318 --> 35:54.446
- Input.

35:54.487 --> 35:57.615
- Mm-hmm.
- 000.

35:57.657 --> 36:00.243
- Okay.
- 010.

36:02.287 --> 36:03.955
100.

36:21.139 --> 36:23.016
It's gonna flower soon.

36:23.058 --> 36:24.559
I can feel it.

36:24.601 --> 36:26.061
- I believe you.

36:26.102 --> 36:30.190
- And we can get high off
these amazingly juicy berries.

36:30.231 --> 36:34.027
And when I get back to Earth,
I'll be a billionaire.

36:36.946 --> 36:38.615
- Well, you'll still
have to cook it.

36:42.327 --> 36:44.329
- What?

36:44.371 --> 36:50.335
- THC and weed needs to be
heated in order to activate.

36:50.377 --> 36:52.629
So you're gonna have to,
you know, like,

36:52.671 --> 36:54.923
bake it or smoke it.

36:54.964 --> 36:59.678
Like, you can't just eat one
of these weeds and get stoned.

36:59.719 --> 37:01.680
But you know, maybe I'm wrong.

37:01.721 --> 37:06.643
Maybe you made the first
raw plant ever to get you high.

37:06.685 --> 37:08.561
Hey, it's still gonna be great.

37:08.603 --> 37:10.480
[bell dings]

37:10.522 --> 37:11.940
Don't look. Don't look.
Don't look.

37:11.981 --> 37:13.066
- What is it?

37:14.901 --> 37:16.986
- Dude, are you ready for this?

37:17.028 --> 37:18.196
- Yes, what is it?

37:18.238 --> 37:21.157
- No peeking!
- Jeez!

37:21.199 --> 37:23.284
- Okay, it's probably thicker
than the real thing

37:23.326 --> 37:26.162
and not as dry and crumbly,
but what do you think?

37:31.167 --> 37:32.711
- Are you serious?

37:32.752 --> 37:34.254
- Yeah.

37:36.881 --> 37:38.591
Oh. Here.

37:38.633 --> 37:40.301

37:45.724 --> 37:49.561

it was high time *

37:49.602 --> 37:53.565
* I picked it up
and walked the line *

* Don't want to have
to look back, no, no *

37:57.402 --> 38:00.447
* And say that I never tried *

38:00.488 --> 38:04.576
- You know what,
country music is not that bad.

38:08.788 --> 38:09.956
What?

38:20.800 --> 38:22.552
We should get her out of here.

38:25.138 --> 38:27.140
I don't want
the girls to see her.

38:40.820 --> 38:41.946
- Do we have to?

56:15.500 --> 56:17.669
- The successful return
of Captain Kwan

56:17.711 --> 56:19.504
and lead science officer
Adam Gherrity

56:19.546 --> 56:22.674
is cause for celebration
the world over.

56:22.716 --> 56:25.593
And perhaps none will be more
elated than their spouses,

56:25.635 --> 56:27.971
Tom Campbell
and Governor Savannah Gherrity,

56:28.013 --> 56:29.222
who are en route as we speak.

56:29.264 --> 56:30.473
- [whispering] Governor?

56:30.515 --> 56:32.517
- At the same time,
we are saddened

56:32.559 --> 56:34.644
to learn of the passing
of lead medical officer

56:34.686 --> 56:37.731
Megan Benson, who passed away
early in the mission

56:37.772 --> 56:39.524
from as-yet-unknown causes.

56:39.566 --> 56:41.568
- What do you think happened?

56:45.238 --> 56:46.906
Uh...
[gun cocks]

56:46.948 --> 56:48.450
- [yelling]

56:48.491 --> 56:50.952
- No, no, Benson, stop! Benson!

56:50.994 --> 56:52.412
- [yells]

56:54.080 --> 56:56.791
Uh, she passed in her sleep.

56:58.001 --> 57:00.170
And as far as we can tell,

57:00.211 --> 57:04.132
it was either cardiac arrest
or an aneurysm.

57:04.174 --> 57:05.508
[reporters clamoring]

57:05.550 --> 57:08.011
- I'm sure you all have
endless questions.

57:08.053 --> 57:09.179
Captain Kwan,
Lieutenant Gherrity?

57:09.220 --> 57:11.097
- Adam?

57:11.139 --> 57:15.894
- Savvie.

57:15.935 --> 57:19.022
[soft music]

57:19.064 --> 57:25.570
* *

57:25.612 --> 57:28.156
- Hi.

57:28.198 --> 57:30.575
- One more question.
One question.

57:30.617 --> 57:31.659
- Let's go home.

57:34.037 --> 57:35.497
- What are you gonna do first?

57:50.011 --> 57:51.596
[knock at door]

57:51.638 --> 57:53.431
- Hi.
So next up is the MRI.

57:53.473 --> 57:55.684
They're just getting set up.
- Okay.

57:55.725 --> 57:57.268
Thank you.

57:57.310 --> 57:58.561
[door closes]

57:58.603 --> 58:00.230
Oh, my God.

58:00.271 --> 58:03.149
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

58:08.822 --> 58:10.156
[knock on door]

58:10.198 --> 58:11.408
Yep.

58:13.993 --> 58:15.328
- Hi.

58:15.370 --> 58:18.957
* *

58:18.998 --> 58:20.500
- Tom.

58:20.542 --> 58:22.627
Um.

58:22.669 --> 58:24.963
Hi.

58:25.005 --> 58:26.840
- Oh.

58:29.217 --> 58:31.553
- Wait. Wait one second.

58:31.594 --> 58:35.765
Uh, if you have gone and pulled
a "Castaway" on me

58:35.807 --> 58:38.810
and married someone else,
totally cool.

58:38.852 --> 58:40.478
Just tell me now
because I don't think

58:40.520 --> 58:41.980
I could actually do--
- No.

58:42.022 --> 58:43.690
- No?

58:45.316 --> 58:46.443
- Still here.

58:50.196 --> 58:52.824
- Didn't you think I was dead?

58:56.536 --> 58:59.205
- Do we have to do this now?

58:59.247 --> 59:01.291
- Yeah, I mean, why not?

59:01.332 --> 59:03.501
What else is there
to talk about?

59:03.543 --> 59:06.504
I mean, I wanna know.

59:06.546 --> 59:10.550
- After about a year, my sister
set me up with someone.

59:10.592 --> 59:11.843
- Sure.

59:11.885 --> 59:14.554
- And then...

59:14.596 --> 59:18.058
there were three or four
other short things after that.

59:18.099 --> 59:20.477
They--they--they just--they--

59:22.896 --> 59:24.731
Nothing ever took.

59:28.860 --> 59:31.363
They couldn't hold
a candle to you.

59:41.748 --> 59:45.377
- Sorry about the whole
kiss attack thing earlier.

59:47.379 --> 59:49.798
I was just really excited
to see you.

59:49.839 --> 59:52.634
And I had my team
in my head just telling me

59:52.676 --> 59:54.427
what an important moment
this was,

59:54.469 --> 59:58.306
and everything had to go
just right, and...

59:58.348 --> 01:00:03.812
inside, I was just terrified.

01:00:03.853 --> 01:00:06.815
- Of what?

01:00:06.856 --> 01:00:09.401
- I don't know.

01:00:09.442 --> 01:00:11.194
Three years is a long time.

01:00:11.236 --> 01:00:12.612
-Yeah.

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:17.033
- I really didn't think I was
ever gonna see you again.

01:00:17.075 --> 01:00:18.451
- Same.

01:00:21.663 --> 01:00:25.083
- God knows what you must think
of all this governor stuff.

01:00:25.125 --> 01:00:26.584
- [scoffs]

01:00:26.626 --> 01:00:28.753
- No, because I feel like
I need to explain this to you

01:00:28.795 --> 01:00:31.923
because listen,
when you disappeared,

01:00:31.965 --> 01:00:36.636
there was suddenly
this spotlight on me.

01:00:36.678 --> 01:00:39.222
And I couldn't just go out
and have death rebound sex

01:00:39.264 --> 01:00:41.808
like a normal person.

01:00:41.850 --> 01:00:43.268
[sighs]

01:00:43.309 --> 01:00:47.022
I had to just play the part
and meet the expectations,

01:00:47.063 --> 01:00:48.732
and I was stuck.

01:00:50.650 --> 01:00:55.113
All I had was my work.

01:00:55.155 --> 01:00:59.367
So then this opportunity to run
came up, and I just took it.

01:00:59.409 --> 01:01:03.038
- Listen, babe,
I'm proud of you.

01:01:05.081 --> 01:01:06.666
- You are?
- Yeah.

01:01:10.253 --> 01:01:12.964
[mellow upbeat music]

01:01:13.006 --> 01:01:16.968
* *

01:01:17.010 --> 01:01:21.973
So here, you have the
marijuana kush or flower.

01:01:22.015 --> 01:01:24.309
Here, you have the blueberry,
luscious, wholesome.

01:01:24.351 --> 01:01:27.354
- She was, like,
screaming at Adam...

01:01:27.395 --> 01:01:29.230
coming toward, um...

01:01:29.272 --> 01:01:31.608
- * Can't you see? *

01:01:31.649 --> 01:01:33.777
[Ariel Days' "You Love Me
In My Dreams"]

01:01:33.818 --> 01:01:36.154
* And do you ever *

01:01:36.196 --> 01:01:38.239
* *

01:01:38.281 --> 01:01:40.450
* Dream of me? *

01:01:40.492 --> 01:01:42.702
* *

01:01:42.744 --> 01:01:45.080
* Please just listen *

01:01:45.121 --> 01:01:47.332
* *

01:01:47.374 --> 01:01:49.209
- We have one
that goes like this.

01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:51.002
[drill whirring]

01:01:51.044 --> 01:01:52.420
Slower.

01:01:52.462 --> 01:01:53.922
And it's erratic,

01:01:53.963 --> 01:01:55.423
but that's what I like
about it.

01:01:58.593 --> 01:01:59.719
You wanna try?

01:02:02.389 --> 01:02:03.473
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:02:04.933 --> 01:02:06.893
- I'm fine.

01:02:06.935 --> 01:02:08.436
I'm okay.

01:02:10.063 --> 01:02:12.732
Just...
both: Just happy to be home.

01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:17.445
- Where is this guy?

01:02:17.487 --> 01:02:19.656
They run out of ink?
- [laughs]

01:02:19.698 --> 01:02:22.117
It's NASA, don't--don't they
have printers here?

01:02:22.158 --> 01:02:23.410
Sign these papers.

01:02:23.451 --> 01:02:25.078
- [flatly] Sign this paper.

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:28.373
[chuckles]
- It doesn't feel real.

01:02:28.415 --> 01:02:30.375
- I'm here.
- I know.

01:02:30.417 --> 01:02:32.210
- I'm so sorry.

01:02:32.252 --> 01:02:34.254
We just need a few more
security guards out there

01:02:34.295 --> 01:02:36.214
to help keep the press at bay.

01:02:36.256 --> 01:02:39.134
- No worries.
- Not a problem.

01:02:39.175 --> 01:02:42.387
I promise it's gonna
start feeling normal soon.

01:02:42.429 --> 01:02:43.596
- Yeah.

01:02:43.638 --> 01:02:45.807
- Oh, I'm so glad
we didn't miss you guys.

01:02:45.849 --> 01:02:47.392
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

01:02:47.434 --> 01:02:48.893
It's so good to see you, Jane.

01:02:48.935 --> 01:02:50.603
- You too, Savannah.
- Hi.

01:02:50.645 --> 01:02:52.939
That farewell dinner
feels like a lifetime ago.

01:02:52.981 --> 01:02:55.400
Oh, my God, yeah,
two lifetimes ago.

01:02:55.442 --> 01:02:56.401
- I know.
- Hey.

01:02:56.443 --> 01:02:57.527
Hey. How's it going?

01:02:57.569 --> 01:02:58.903
- Thanks for taking care
of my girl.

01:02:58.945 --> 01:03:00.280
- More like
she took care of me.

01:03:00.321 --> 01:03:01.489
- [chuckles]

01:03:03.116 --> 01:03:05.410
- I'm keeping the girls.

01:03:05.452 --> 01:03:06.494
- Oh.
- Yeah.

01:03:06.536 --> 01:03:07.746
- The girls?
- The hens.

01:03:07.787 --> 01:03:09.789
That's what we call the hens.
- Oh.

01:03:09.831 --> 01:03:12.125
- Unless you guys want some.

01:03:12.167 --> 01:03:13.918
- Oh, um--
- Why not?

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:15.920
We've got the space.
- I don't know.

01:03:15.962 --> 01:03:18.048
You know, if I deployed--
- Come on.

01:03:18.089 --> 01:03:20.884
You guys are international
space heroes now.

01:03:20.925 --> 01:03:22.594
Your deployment days
are behind you.

01:03:22.635 --> 01:03:24.179
I mean, you're celebrities.
- Okay, okay.

01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:25.680
It's just they make a mess.
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:03:25.722 --> 01:03:27.891
How much of a mess
are we talking about here?

01:03:27.932 --> 01:03:29.476
- Oh, no, they're great.
They're great.

01:03:29.517 --> 01:03:31.144
I'm really glad
you're taking them.

01:03:31.186 --> 01:03:35.607
I wanted to take Benson home,
but they said no, so--

01:03:35.648 --> 01:03:37.233
- [chuckles]

01:03:37.275 --> 01:03:39.903
- Okay, so your discharge
papers are ready now.

01:03:39.944 --> 01:03:41.654
- All right.
- Hey, you know what?

01:03:41.696 --> 01:03:42.906
Why don't Tom and I
handle this?

01:03:42.947 --> 01:03:45.283
You guys just take a minute.
Say goodbye.

01:03:45.325 --> 01:03:46.785
- Oh.
- Yeah. I got it.

01:03:46.826 --> 01:03:48.286
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

01:03:48.328 --> 01:03:49.871
- Yeah. Yeah.
- All right.

01:03:54.709 --> 01:03:56.294
- Ate a Pop-Tart this morning.

01:03:56.336 --> 01:03:58.213
- Oh, yeah? How was it?

01:03:58.254 --> 01:04:01.383
- Well, after your homemade
ones, I'm a little ruined.

01:04:01.424 --> 01:04:04.135
Mm, well.
[both chuckle]

01:04:04.177 --> 01:04:05.804
I'll get you the recipe.

01:04:05.845 --> 01:04:08.181
All you need is a steady supply
of fresh,

01:04:08.223 --> 01:04:10.850
unpasteurized goat's milk.

01:04:12.769 --> 01:04:15.271
- So I'll hear from you.

01:04:15.313 --> 01:04:16.940
- Yeah, of course.
I mean, we'll see each other.

01:04:16.981 --> 01:04:18.149
We've got interviews
coming up--

01:04:18.191 --> 01:04:19.150
- Not like that.

01:04:19.192 --> 01:04:21.486
[pensive music]

01:04:21.528 --> 01:04:23.321
Will you be a part of my life?

01:04:23.363 --> 01:04:30.245
* *

01:04:31.204 --> 01:04:32.956
- No.

01:04:32.997 --> 01:04:35.375
- Come on.

01:04:35.417 --> 01:04:38.962
Just a phone call
every now and then, you know?

01:04:39.004 --> 01:04:41.006
Old friends
checking up on each other.

01:04:41.047 --> 01:04:44.676
- Adam, we were stuck
in a box for three years,

01:04:44.718 --> 01:04:47.512
and it messed with our heads.

01:04:47.554 --> 01:04:48.888
And now we're out of that box.

01:04:51.391 --> 01:04:52.767
This is real.

01:04:52.809 --> 01:04:55.729
Up there, it wasn't real.

01:04:57.230 --> 01:04:59.357
- You ready?

01:04:59.399 --> 01:05:02.027
Huh. Yeah.

01:05:03.778 --> 01:05:07.490
So, well, bye.

01:05:07.532 --> 01:05:09.617
- See you guys.
- Bye.

01:05:09.659 --> 01:05:10.744
See you, Adam.

01:05:13.496 --> 01:05:17.167
Discharged.
- Discharged.

01:05:17.208 --> 01:05:23.006
- We're on in five, four,
three, two...

01:05:23.048 --> 01:05:24.924
- Adam, the world
wants to know.

01:05:24.966 --> 01:05:27.677
How did you survive in space?

01:05:27.719 --> 01:05:29.012
- Well, that's
a loaded question.

01:05:29.054 --> 01:05:30.597
- Yeah.

01:05:30.638 --> 01:05:33.892
We basically had a living,
breathing ecosystem

01:05:33.933 --> 01:05:35.894
on the ship, so we were able

01:05:35.935 --> 01:05:37.395
to sustain our own food,

01:05:37.437 --> 01:05:39.564
and the ship created oxygen.

01:05:39.606 --> 01:05:42.484
And we, um,

01:05:42.525 --> 01:05:44.319
we made our way through it.

01:05:44.361 --> 01:05:46.863
- He was just circling
the grocery parking lot.

01:05:46.905 --> 01:05:48.073
- Is this the
parking lot story again?

01:05:48.114 --> 01:05:49.366
- Over and over.
- Come on.

01:05:49.407 --> 01:05:51.743
- I wanna, like, close it.
There we go.

01:05:55.455 --> 01:05:58.083
- So what have the two of you
been doing to reconnect,

01:05:58.124 --> 01:06:00.627
I mean, after three years?

01:06:00.669 --> 01:06:02.170
- Well, we've been trying
to make up

01:06:02.212 --> 01:06:04.255
for lost time, you know?

01:06:04.297 --> 01:06:11.262
* *

01:06:14.015 --> 01:06:16.643
- And my wife's the governor.
- [chuckles]

01:06:16.685 --> 01:06:19.312
- Yeah, so that's a little...
different.
