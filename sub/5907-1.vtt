00:26.200 --> 00:28.400
I always get the shakes before a drop.

00:30.800 --> 00:32.299
I had the injection,

00:33.600 --> 00:35.600
hypnotic prep,

00:37.600 --> 00:40.200
and federation shrinks
scan my brain waves.

00:45.700 --> 00:47.700
Everything checked out.

00:48.700 --> 00:50.800
Doc said it wasn't fear.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.800
I could've told him that.

00:58.300 --> 01:01.100
A horse locked in the starting
gate isn't afraid.

01:01.300 --> 01:03.800
He's just ready to run.

01:43.600 --> 01:47.500
A team, our mission is to seize
and control the B dock carrier,

01:47.600 --> 01:50.800
and clear away the bugs
and evac the survivor.

01:50.900 --> 01:55.200
And once we land, we join forces
with the K-12 team at the fort.

01:55.200 --> 01:56.600
It's a standard grab and go.

01:56.600 --> 01:59.100
After the rescue, we
return to the ship,

01:59.100 --> 02:02.000
take off and then we blow
the fort and the bugs.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.400
Are we clear?

02:03.400 --> 02:05.200
Loud and clear sir.

02:17.000 --> 02:17.900
Go..

02:18.800 --> 02:20.100
Go, go, go..

02:59.100 --> 02:59.700
Report!

02:59.700 --> 03:02.300
Pretty bad sir. Someone of our men
are still in the bar corridor.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.300
Then let's get them out of there.

03:04.400 --> 03:07.300
Mech, we're done here.
We have to blow.

03:07.300 --> 03:07.600
Sir!

03:07.700 --> 03:12.700
Holy Man and Chow, on the cover.
Biggest and Grimeshock hold position.

03:12.700 --> 03:14.500
The rest of you, follow me.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.900
We're on a rescue mission, people.

03:27.100 --> 03:29.400
Lt Jordan, what's your status?

03:29.500 --> 03:32.000
Too many bugs, no way
to take back Fort Casey.

03:32.100 --> 03:34.700
We'll hold until the
John A. Warden evacuates.

03:35.300 --> 03:38.100
Alesia will stand-by
for immediate evac.

03:38.100 --> 03:39.800
- Keep me posted.
- Roger that.

03:39.900 --> 03:40.800
Mech, what's your ETR?

03:40.800 --> 03:42.300
Almost there, sir.

03:47.900 --> 03:49.900
Done. Let's go.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.700
Charleston down. Medic!

04:03.800 --> 04:05.200
I'm on it.

04:12.900 --> 04:15.000
Have you completed loading the crates?

04:15.500 --> 04:18.200
Note that is your priority.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.500
What the hell is this about, Carl?

04:30.600 --> 04:32.100
Wonderful to see you again, Carmen.

04:32.200 --> 04:33.900
You commandeer my damn ship.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.900
Borrowing it. I'll give it back.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.300
You're never going to take
the John A. Warden from me.

04:38.300 --> 04:42.600
Guards, I believe Capt. Ibanez
needs an escort to the East Wing.

04:43.400 --> 04:45.400
What do you want with my ship, Carl?

04:46.100 --> 04:50.500
Carmen, that's classified.
But I can tell you this,

04:50.500 --> 04:53.600
this mission, oh this mission
will turn the tide.

04:53.700 --> 04:56.000
You always were such an asshole.

04:56.300 --> 04:59.500
And I'm always so fond of
you as well, Carmen.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.200
See you on Terra.

05:02.100 --> 05:04.400
Friends always, right?

05:18.600 --> 05:21.400
A team reload!

05:23.200 --> 05:25.300
This is A team leader
to Fort Casey.

05:25.500 --> 05:26.800
Evac, come in

05:26.800 --> 05:28.300
About god damn time.

05:28.300 --> 05:30.500
It's a little crowded out here,
exit now. Dock B.

05:30.600 --> 05:31.600
On our way.

05:31.800 --> 05:32.700
Show some hustle.

05:32.900 --> 05:35.600
It's quiet now but that
ain't going to last.

05:35.600 --> 05:36.700
Evac coming out.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.100
Keep your eyes open
and your heads down.

05:39.200 --> 05:41.300
I don't to lose anyone
to friendly fire.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.100
Who's in charge?

05:48.200 --> 05:49.500
Acting commander, sir!

05:49.700 --> 05:52.000
Major Henry Varro was been
relieved of duty.

05:52.100 --> 05:54.400
Relieved? What the hell happened?

05:54.800 --> 05:58.600
This was a suicide mission from
the get go. Fucking headcase!

05:58.600 --> 06:01.500
Shut your mouth Ratsazz.
You want to be busted like Hero?

06:45.400 --> 06:48.300
We're outta here.
Let's get back to the ship.

06:48.600 --> 06:51.300
Mech, how is it coming
with that charge?

06:51.400 --> 06:53.400
Armed and dangerous.

07:01.700 --> 07:04.100
You have to be kidding me!

07:12.600 --> 07:14.700
Thanks for waiting, jackass!

07:16.600 --> 07:19.600
Command, if there's a new order,
let me know, goddamn it.

07:19.700 --> 07:22.700
Are we going to escort the
John A. Warden or not?

07:33.800 --> 07:35.200
Behind us!

07:35.200 --> 07:39.000
Sir! This is Biggest, can't
hold on anymore. We're...

07:39.200 --> 07:41.800
Fucking sons-of-bitches....

07:43.100 --> 07:46.800
Captain Jonah, this is A team.
Landing ship destroyed.

07:46.900 --> 07:47.800
Boarding directly now.

07:47.800 --> 07:52.000
Roger that, as soon as you're
aboard, Alesia will depart.

07:53.200 --> 07:56.100
Left formation! Fall back
to the Alesia.

08:17.700 --> 08:20.500
Hold formation!  Hold formation!

08:29.700 --> 08:32.600
My arm! My god damn arm!

08:34.900 --> 08:36.100
Medic!

08:42.700 --> 08:43.900
424!

08:45.200 --> 08:46.200
425!

08:47.200 --> 08:48.200
426!

08:48.900 --> 08:50.600
Return to the ship!

08:53.200 --> 08:54.200
428!

08:55.000 --> 08:56.300
429!

08:57.000 --> 08:57.800
430!

08:58.400 --> 08:59.100
431!

08:59.100 --> 09:02.900
Trig, move your god damn ass!
We're taking off!

09:16.000 --> 09:17.100
Come on.

09:17.400 --> 09:18.500
Come on.

09:21.300 --> 09:23.300
Jump!

09:34.900 --> 09:36.400
Thanks.

09:37.400 --> 09:38.300
Anytime.

09:38.900 --> 09:40.800
- Score?
- 430.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.700
Give or take.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.600
You going to do it or what?

10:14.700 --> 10:17.100
Hit it Maestro

10:18.900 --> 10:21.600
3, 2, 1.

10:21.700 --> 10:23.300
Boom!

10:30.900 --> 10:34.000
Come on guy, this shit ain't over yet.

10:38.800 --> 10:42.300
Haha yeah, alright.

10:50.600 --> 10:53.200
So what the hell happen
to you guys down there?

10:53.300 --> 10:55.800
We were right on top of a
motherfucking ant hill.

10:55.900 --> 11:01.400
Varro saved our ass, then that ESP
prick Jenkins sent us on a death run.

11:01.600 --> 11:04.600
Straight into a god damn hive.

11:04.700 --> 11:07.000
But you didn't hear that shit from me.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.800
Ah, I'm sorry, did you say something?

11:08.800 --> 11:09.900
Attention!

11:14.700 --> 11:17.100
You can all be proud of yourselves.

11:19.400 --> 11:20.900
We saved some lives

11:21.100 --> 11:23.200
and we killed some bugs

11:24.100 --> 11:26.400
But we lost some good troopers today.

11:26.700 --> 11:28.000
Here's to the dead.

11:28.100 --> 11:30.500
And to the next man to die.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.000
Now let's get back to Terra

11:32.100 --> 11:34.500
and we can put some real
glasses in these hands.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.000
Hey, check that out.

11:46.500 --> 11:50.300
What's the matter, you never saw
a flanking without an arm before?

11:50.400 --> 11:52.700
Yeah, but they usually
looks like Ratsass.

11:53.500 --> 11:54.800
Ratsass?

11:55.000 --> 11:56.200
That's what they call me

11:56.200 --> 11:58.800
because you didn't give a
rat-ass about anything.

11:58.800 --> 11:59.600
What a surprise.

11:59.800 --> 12:03.400
Hey, you wanna me to
show you to the shower?

12:03.700 --> 12:05.400
I could wash you back.

12:07.500 --> 12:09.500
You don't want to wash my front?

12:20.700 --> 12:22.100
Shut up!

12:38.800 --> 12:40.300
Captain on the bridge.

12:40.900 --> 12:43.900
Stand down, this is your
ship not mine Captain.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.800
Simple respect, Captain Ibanez,
for what happened on Planet P.

12:48.900 --> 12:51.300
If only more stripes were executed that way.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.000
I had a good team.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.200
What can you tell me?

12:56.100 --> 12:58.300
- About?
- Where's my ship?

12:58.300 --> 13:00.000
And why does Jenkins want it so badly?

13:00.100 --> 13:03.300
Captain, believe me. If I could
provide you with any information

13:03.400 --> 13:06.100
This ship is in pursuit of
the John A. Warden, isn't it?

13:06.200 --> 13:08.100
I understand your concern
of John A. Warden,

13:08.100 --> 13:11.400
Captain Ibanez, but this is the
Alesia and we command it.

13:11.500 --> 13:14.000
Our orders are to return to Terra

13:14.000 --> 13:16.300
Then show me that data on
the John A. Warden's path.

13:16.400 --> 13:17.900
Where is she headed?

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
We don't know, Captain.

13:19.300 --> 13:23.200
We lost her signal shortly
after we began pursuit.

13:26.300 --> 13:29.200
Please contact me if you find
the John A. Warden.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.600
Aye, aye, Captain

13:35.300 --> 13:38.400
Don't have a joint of some kind?

13:38.800 --> 13:41.000
This is a serious wound.

13:43.300 --> 13:44.900
Could have been a lot worse.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.900
I can't keep something like
this off the record.

13:48.500 --> 13:50.900
I'm going have to
take your arm off.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.500
Fine. But look..

13:52.800 --> 13:55.700
At least do what you can to make sure so
it doesn't get back to my folks.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.800
You can at least do that, right, Doc?

14:03.600 --> 14:04.600
Let's do this.

14:05.300 --> 14:07.300
Why don't we wait until
the shaking stops?

14:07.300 --> 14:08.300
The ship will be fine.

14:08.300 --> 14:09.900
I'm not talking about the ship.

14:47.200 --> 14:51.000
Hey. noob, dance class
is down the hall.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
No, it's right here. Care to dance?

14:55.100 --> 14:57.400
This ring is for fighting.

14:57.400 --> 14:58.500
Humor me.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.200
- What's your name?
- Chow.

15:02.400 --> 15:03.400
Well Chow,

15:03.500 --> 15:05.700
I don't usually dance with guys,

15:05.700 --> 15:08.400
but in your case, I'll
make an exception.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.100
Who's your money on?

15:10.300 --> 15:11.600
Ratsazz is bigger.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.300
- Not much upstairs though.
- Whatever, dude.

15:14.400 --> 15:18.100
Ratsazz gets him one good solid hit,
Chow is going down.

15:18.100 --> 15:19.600
Shit, if he could ever land a punch.

15:19.700 --> 15:21.400
Chow is fast, man.

15:22.200 --> 15:26.800
Alright, fighters to your corners.

15:29.900 --> 15:33.800
You back up down,
I won't think even less of you.

15:35.500 --> 15:38.500
When I ring the bell,
come out fighting.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.200
We're going to miss you
when you're gone.

16:09.900 --> 16:11.800
Good thing there's
not much upstairs,

16:11.800 --> 16:13.200
don't have to worry
about brain damage.

16:13.300 --> 16:15.500
Hey, damage this...

16:29.600 --> 16:30.800
Hey..

16:42.600 --> 16:44.400
You see that?

16:49.000 --> 16:51.200
Didn't know you had it in you.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.100
Flash of inspiration.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.100
E-057..

17:01.300 --> 17:03.300
E-057..

17:03.900 --> 17:07.599
E...0..5...7

17:25.599 --> 17:27.000
Thanks. I really appreciate..

17:27.400 --> 17:29.000
it.

17:35.800 --> 17:38.300
They can't get me a
bed until tomorrow.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.400
Thanks for letting me use the comm...

17:41.400 --> 17:42.600
Tia

17:43.000 --> 17:44.400
Tia Durer

17:44.500 --> 17:47.100
- Trig is fine.
- Otis Hags.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.000
Bugspray.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.400
Hey...

17:52.800 --> 17:54.800
Thanks for the catch..

17:54.800 --> 17:57.000
at Fort Casey.

17:58.100 --> 17:59.300
You're sleeping with a gun?

17:59.800 --> 18:02.300
You must know something I don't.

18:03.100 --> 18:05.700
Barreta XXX4.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.800
A classic.

18:12.900 --> 18:15.000
You've got a nice smile for a soldier.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.300
Thanks.

18:17.100 --> 18:18.600
I think.

18:19.400 --> 18:20.600
So..

18:20.800 --> 18:21.900
Up for a little training?

18:22.100 --> 18:26.500
I think I have about all the target
practice I could stand today.

18:26.600 --> 18:29.200
Yeah, I was thinking about something
a little more...

18:29.300 --> 18:30.800
Extreme-less.

18:36.500 --> 18:39.100
You didn't really use the
intercom, did you?

18:39.600 --> 18:41.800
Would you like to know more?

18:50.000 --> 18:52.600
Everyone is doing their part.

19:05.700 --> 19:08.800
Major Henry Varro..

19:10.800 --> 19:14.400
One of the most decorated
officers in the federation.

19:16.400 --> 19:20.900
You earn long range ops
in places even god won't.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.800
What did you do?

19:28.100 --> 19:29.300
Why won't you talk?

19:30.500 --> 19:33.600
And why won't your men talk?

19:43.500 --> 19:48.100
HE-RO

19:56.800 --> 19:59.000
They're a couple of
modifications you can

19:59.000 --> 20:01.700
score on the black market
when you get to Terra.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.300
But as far as what the Federation
would pay for it,

20:04.300 --> 20:05.800
it's still a pretty
good prosthetic.

20:05.800 --> 20:06.400
Got it.

20:06.900 --> 20:08.100
Nice job.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.000
Don't know what you're nervous about..

20:10.000 --> 20:12.400
I bet this looks good
as all the others.

20:14.100 --> 20:16.000
What others? You're my first.

20:17.700 --> 20:19.300
As the matter of fact,
you're the first guy

20:19.300 --> 20:21.200
that I've worked on that actually lived.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.700
Every Commander
I've ever served under,

20:28.700 --> 20:31.300
tries to get me to use
a regular machine gun.

20:31.700 --> 20:35.000
That is until they see how
many I kill without one.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.600
And they don't ask me anymore.

20:41.300 --> 20:43.300
My parents left me that rifle.

20:46.700 --> 20:49.500
There was an armory in my hometown.

20:49.800 --> 20:52.800
Everyone worked there.

20:56.800 --> 21:00.600
That is until the bugs melted
the place with a plasma bomb.

21:01.000 --> 21:05.800
Soldiers, civilians, families.

21:06.400 --> 21:08.200
Everyone died.

21:11.200 --> 21:15.300
I swore then that I'd kill
just as many bugs.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.700
And I would do it with that gun.

21:21.600 --> 21:23.900
That's why you count?

21:25.000 --> 21:28.300
No, that's why it counts.

22:07.900 --> 22:09.500
God damn you, Carl.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.700
Where did you learn
that hay maker?

22:20.800 --> 22:21.700
Dance class.

22:22.600 --> 22:24.300
Shit! I knew it!

22:24.500 --> 22:26.000
I just felt it.

22:26.500 --> 22:29.100
We aren't going to see Terra
anytime soon.

22:29.200 --> 22:30.000
Well private...

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Specialist actually.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.700
Well...Almost

22:33.800 --> 22:35.500
5 points short on the ESP test,

22:35.500 --> 22:38.000
if one more jack had
have been a diamond,

22:38.000 --> 22:40.100
I wouldn't be here
with your dumb asses.

22:42.200 --> 22:43.800
You son-of-a-bitch!

22:43.900 --> 22:46.100
That's how you always know
when I'm in the shower.

22:48.100 --> 22:51.500
So, can you tell what
I'm thinking now?

22:51.500 --> 22:53.500
Hell, even I know what
you're thinking now.

22:53.600 --> 22:54.600
You make me sick.

23:00.800 --> 23:02.400
What's up, Lt Daugherty?

23:02.500 --> 23:03.800
I thought you were in medical?

23:04.000 --> 23:04.500
Ah...

23:05.000 --> 23:06.100
Wasn't as bad as it looks.

23:09.700 --> 23:12.700
Ah..glad you two could make it.

23:23.500 --> 23:24.300
At ease.

23:26.900 --> 23:29.000
I wanted you brief you all personally.

23:29.000 --> 23:29.700
First and foremost,

23:29.800 --> 23:33.700
because I know of the great sacrifices
of both the crew of the Alesia

23:33.700 --> 23:35.900
as well as the defender
of Fort Casey have made

23:35.900 --> 23:38.100
and the great losses
that you suffered

23:38.100 --> 23:41.300
and second, I know you could
all use some R&R about now

23:41.600 --> 23:43.500
Believe me, I've been there myself.

23:43.800 --> 23:46.600
But unfortunately,
we have a situation.

23:47.600 --> 23:48.100
What?!

23:48.200 --> 23:48.800
Stowen!

23:49.000 --> 23:50.800
The John A. Warden has gone silent.

23:51.300 --> 23:55.400
The Alesia is the only starship in
the areas of last contact.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.900
I've ordered your Captain
to divert course,

23:57.900 --> 24:00.200
find the Warden and investigate.

24:01.600 --> 24:03.300
Any question?

24:04.800 --> 24:05.300
Yeah.

24:05.600 --> 24:08.500
I think I speak for everyone from
Fort Casey when I say this..

24:08.600 --> 24:10.000
Shut the fuck up!

24:10.100 --> 24:11.600
It's okay, go on.

24:13.500 --> 24:16.500
We're only going in if
Hero takes point.

24:17.700 --> 24:18.300
Hero?

24:18.800 --> 24:19.400
Major Henry Varro.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.800
Commander of Fort Casey, General Rico.

24:22.900 --> 24:23.500
Right...

24:24.600 --> 24:26.800
Arrested by Dr. Carl
Jenkins for insubordination

24:26.800 --> 24:28.500
at the battle at Fort Casey.

24:29.600 --> 24:30.500
Fine!

24:30.500 --> 24:33.400
If Major Varro chooses to
participate in this mission,

24:33.400 --> 24:35.700
the mobile infantry will
accept his service.

24:35.700 --> 24:38.900
However, this will not in any way
be prejudicial to his trial.

24:38.900 --> 24:39.900
Is that understood?

24:40.100 --> 24:41.200
Understood sir.

24:41.600 --> 24:44.600
We probably lose communication
as you cross the Nebula...

24:45.600 --> 24:47.900
Godspeed, Alesia!

24:48.000 --> 24:49.100
Dismissed!

24:51.200 --> 24:53.500
Assemble in the staging area.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.500
A word Captain Ibanez.

24:58.300 --> 25:00.000
Why did you let him take my ship?

25:01.000 --> 25:05.100
Carmen, it's not your ship, it
belongs to the Terran Federation.

25:05.400 --> 25:09.000
General Rico, perhaps you recall
there were a certain young trooper

25:09.000 --> 25:11.600
who was with me when the
Rodger Young went down...

25:12.000 --> 25:15.800
I vowed that would never happen
to a ship under my command.

25:17.100 --> 25:19.200
This is not my choice

25:19.200 --> 25:20.000
Honey, look.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.800
I don't care what you thought
about Carl back when you knew him

25:22.900 --> 25:24.200
and I don't care what you
think about him now.

25:24.900 --> 25:26.200
He's minister of
paranormal warfare

25:26.200 --> 25:29.700
and high command has authorized
him to use the John A. Warden.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.400
Look, Carmen...

25:32.900 --> 25:36.400
This is a mission that's so classified
I don't even know what the hell..

25:36.400 --> 25:37.800
And look how well It's going.

25:38.200 --> 25:41.000
You know that the John A. Warden
like the back of your hand

25:42.400 --> 25:44.100
I need you to go aboard
with the insertion team.

25:44.100 --> 25:45.300
I looked at the manifest.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.900
That ship didn't just go dark,

25:49.600 --> 25:51.700
her signal was turned off.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.900
And you know as well as I do,

25:53.900 --> 25:56.200
the only one who has
the gull to run a

25:56.200 --> 25:59.300
Federation Starship
dark is Carl Jenkins.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.200
And how do you know we're
even close to my ship?

26:02.400 --> 26:06.600
Before we lost contact, we analyze
some of the scattered signals.

26:06.600 --> 26:08.100
Calculating course and speed,

26:08.100 --> 26:10.900
we were able to get a good
estimate of it's location.

26:10.900 --> 26:11.900
Now it's not spot on,

26:11.900 --> 26:13.900
but we can get you
pretty damn close.

26:17.300 --> 26:18.000
Fine!

26:19.000 --> 26:20.500
I'll do it.

26:20.600 --> 26:23.100
But not to save Carl's sorry ass,

26:23.100 --> 26:26.500
I'll do it to take back my ship.

26:26.700 --> 26:28.200
You just be careful.

26:28.700 --> 26:32.300
We need you back, intact,
when this thing is over.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.800
Thank you Johnny.

26:36.800 --> 26:37.700
Hey Carmen...

26:37.800 --> 26:42.300
When this thing is over, maybe you
and I could meet at Zim and ahhh..

26:43.300 --> 26:44.200
Yeah..

26:45.500 --> 26:46.400
Yeah...

26:48.800 --> 26:54.600
I gotta tell ya, this will in no way
be prejudicial to your trial.

26:55.800 --> 26:57.700
Ah..come on,

26:58.000 --> 26:59.900
I didn't have anything
to do with any of this.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.800
I'm just a damn janitor
trying to clean it up.

27:06.700 --> 27:07.500
Look, Major...

27:07.600 --> 27:11.600
I'm no more enthusiastic about
saving Carl Jenkins than you are..

27:13.000 --> 27:14.600
But your men want you.

27:16.500 --> 27:19.300
And something tells me,
we're gonna need you.

27:22.200 --> 27:23.300
Lt Daugherty..

27:23.500 --> 27:25.400
We found the John A. Warden.

27:26.100 --> 27:30.100
Tell Captain Jonah to move to
stand off range. I'll be right up.

27:35.400 --> 27:36.900
So, which is it?

27:42.500 --> 27:44.500
Get this chains off me.

28:08.900 --> 28:12.200
It'll be too bad if a stray
shot hit Jenkins.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.900
Look, I know you're pissed,
but don't even think about shit like that.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.400
They threw Hero into the brig, you
or me, Holy Man or Kharon,

28:18.400 --> 28:20.900
what do you think they
do to grunts like us?

28:20.900 --> 28:23.900
They shoved us out of
the god damn air lock.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.500
So I gotta watch my ass?

28:25.700 --> 28:28.700
Yeah, but if you're not gonna
do that, at least watch mine.

28:37.600 --> 28:39.700
Aw man, fuck you!

28:41.100 --> 28:43.600
Can't believe I'm the only who's
didn't get laid around here.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.200
Looks like you've got all
your bases covered.

28:50.700 --> 28:53.800
Tell me Holy Man, which one
gonna save you today?

29:02.500 --> 29:05.100
I can take care of myself.

29:11.500 --> 29:15.100
Women, they make the highs higher
and the lows more frequent.

29:15.200 --> 29:17.700
Are atheists the only
philosophers you can quote?

29:18.100 --> 29:23.700
I find a believer such as you seek
so few things worth writing down.

29:24.400 --> 29:25.300
And I found..

29:25.800 --> 29:31.600
That he who look so forward to the
abyss is simply afraid of the light.

29:32.700 --> 29:34.900
I'm gonna get you a pen.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.900
Wait, did you just make that up?

29:37.500 --> 29:39.700
No, I'm not writing that down.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.300
John A. Warden, this is the
Alesia, please respond.

29:49.800 --> 29:54.700
I try everything, voice, radio flash,
even light code. Nothing.

29:54.800 --> 29:56.600
Keep trying Lieutenant.

29:56.700 --> 29:58.500
Zoom in on the bridge.

29:59.900 --> 30:01.700
Maybe they can't hear us.

30:02.800 --> 30:05.400
They have to know what
our objective is.

30:06.500 --> 30:09.800
Bridge, this is your
Captain, respond now!

30:09.800 --> 30:12.800
If you do not
respond we will board.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.900
Board it, that's not my ship anymore.

30:55.700 --> 30:57.100
Kids?

30:59.300 --> 31:00.600
Husband?

31:02.400 --> 31:05.400
Died on planet 4976.

31:05.500 --> 31:08.000
Hey, the way I figured it,

31:08.100 --> 31:10.900
the bugs got more reason
to be sacred than I do.

31:11.000 --> 31:15.400
I killed hundreds of them.
They kill zero of me.

31:19.600 --> 31:21.200
Ahh man..

31:23.900 --> 31:27.500
Listen, I want you
to do me a favor...

31:27.500 --> 31:28.200
Yeah?

31:28.600 --> 31:30.200
If I don't make it,

31:30.200 --> 31:33.000
I don't care what
happens to my body

31:33.000 --> 31:36.300
but try to get my
rifle's scope, will you?

31:36.300 --> 31:39.000
And have it buried in my hometown.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.800
Look, I don't like funerals.

31:43.400 --> 31:45.000
Do me a favor,

31:45.100 --> 31:47.600
don't get killed.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.200
Okay, boys and girls..

32:21.500 --> 32:24.000
Looks like this is going
to be my last mission,

32:24.000 --> 32:25.600
so let's make it a good one.

32:26.500 --> 32:29.300
Our job is to retake the
John A. Warden,

32:29.300 --> 32:31.200
rescue any and all survivors

32:31.200 --> 32:34.400
and exterminate any
resistance we might find.

32:34.500 --> 32:35.600
You got that?

32:36.800 --> 32:37.900
Sir yes sir!

32:39.300 --> 32:41.500
Alright, troopers..

32:41.600 --> 32:44.200
Let's get the lady her ship back.

32:54.100 --> 32:55.900
Initiate docking procedure.

32:56.100 --> 32:58.400
Initiating docking procedure.

33:02.400 --> 33:06.400
Team 1, Lt Daugherty, Ice,
Trig, Mech, Shock Jock

33:06.400 --> 33:08.500
will lead Capt. Ibanez to the bridge.

33:09.600 --> 33:15.200
Team 2, Jace, Kharon, Chow, Bugspray,
Gunfather, Ratsazz, Holy Man

33:15.300 --> 33:15.900
and the rest of you,

33:16.000 --> 33:17.700
you're coming with me
to the engine room.

33:17.800 --> 33:21.600
Don't know we gonna find in
there so be ready for anything.

33:22.100 --> 33:23.100
Let's go..

33:32.800 --> 33:35.400
Gravity zero, oxygen level yellow.

33:35.500 --> 33:37.200
Ready to board the John A. Warden.

34:03.900 --> 34:04.800
We're in.

34:05.200 --> 34:07.900
Team 1 moving towards the bridge.

34:15.600 --> 34:18.699
Team 2 boarding, moving
towards the engine room.

34:44.300 --> 34:46.699
Something up ahead..

34:48.300 --> 34:49.500
No..

34:53.300 --> 34:55.300
Oh my god...

34:57.900 --> 35:01.500
Team two, we got bodies
near the bridge.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.500
We got bodies everywhere.

35:07.800 --> 35:10.600
Ah man, they've been bug-ripped

35:10.700 --> 35:14.000
Infestation confirmed.
Stay sharp, people.

35:14.100 --> 35:15.600
Nearing objective.

35:18.300 --> 35:21.400
Daugherty to team 2,
we're on the bridge.

35:23.900 --> 35:26.400
And it ain't pretty.

35:34.400 --> 35:37.300
Got multiple casualties.

35:38.200 --> 35:40.700
And one dead bug.

35:44.800 --> 35:46.100
All clear!

35:47.600 --> 35:49.500
Shock Jock...

35:56.000 --> 35:57.800
Massive tearing wounds...

36:04.200 --> 36:05.900
My crew.

36:11.100 --> 36:15.300
Bridge is secured. Team 2
what's your status, over.

36:15.300 --> 36:17.900
Entering engine room now, over.

36:31.600 --> 36:33.500
Fucking blood bath..

36:33.600 --> 36:36.700
Team two scout, I got dead
troopers and bugs.

36:38.200 --> 36:40.000
Holy shit!

36:40.400 --> 36:41.900
Amen.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.300
Why'd they all die here?

36:47.300 --> 36:49.500
Focus on the mission, troopers.

36:49.600 --> 36:52.000
Chow, prep the engines.

36:52.400 --> 36:53.800
Yes sir!

37:05.900 --> 37:08.100
Major, I have a survivor...

37:08.200 --> 37:09.900
Well, find him.

37:09.900 --> 37:12.100
Chow, what's the
status on that engine?

37:12.200 --> 37:13.700
- Give me 10.
- You got 5.

37:13.800 --> 37:14.300
Yes sir

37:14.800 --> 37:17.400
Team 1, engine operative in 5.

37:17.500 --> 37:20.300
Is that a real 5 minutes
or sorta 5 minutes? Over.

37:20.300 --> 37:21.400
Hard 5!

37:21.500 --> 37:25.800
And we got a possible survivor.
Going to investigate, over.

37:30.200 --> 37:34.200
Gunfather, have team hold position.
Bugspray and Ratsazz cover Chow.

37:34.300 --> 37:35.900
Like paint, Major.

38:43.700 --> 38:46.200
Looks like they were trying
to make this into a lab.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.300
What is that thing?

39:01.900 --> 39:04.900
Holding cell, to keep a bug inside.

39:05.700 --> 39:09.300
Now, it looks like they were  trying to
keep them out and somebody else in.

39:15.900 --> 39:18.700
Emergency power supply from
Alesia seems to be working.

39:19.300 --> 39:24.900
Team 1, team 2, gravity
restoration in 5, 4..

39:34.900 --> 39:36.100
Fuck!

39:38.200 --> 39:41.400
Internal oxygen level is green.

39:47.100 --> 39:50.800
I feel a whole lot of better If I knew
what happen to those bugs.

39:50.900 --> 39:52.500
Wouldn't we all?

40:14.900 --> 40:15.900
Who's there?

40:17.500 --> 40:18.600
Major Varro.

40:19.400 --> 40:22.000
What're doing here? You're
supposed to be on trial.

40:22.100 --> 40:25.300
Yeah, well looks like
that plan is about as

40:25.400 --> 40:27.400
successful as your
little experiment here.

40:27.400 --> 40:29.500
What happened on this ship, Jenkins?

40:29.500 --> 40:32.000
I hit her, so she hit me...

40:32.400 --> 40:33.300
She?

40:33.700 --> 40:35.200
What do you mean she?

40:35.300 --> 40:39.700
We're the opponent, she hacked
everything, me, the ship.

40:39.700 --> 40:40.800
Everything!

40:40.800 --> 40:44.400
Well of course she did, she
knew what I was thinking,

40:44.400 --> 40:45.700
thoughts become words,
words become deeds,

40:45.700 --> 40:47.000
thoughts becomes words,
words become deeds.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.300
thoughts become words,
words become deeds.

40:48.300 --> 40:50.000
thoughts become words,
words become deeds.

40:50.100 --> 40:51.600
We're going to get you out of here.

40:51.600 --> 40:54.200
You and I can settle our score
later. Open the door. Jenkins.

40:54.200 --> 40:55.300
And let you kill me? No!

40:55.500 --> 40:58.600
Besides, it's safer in here,
safest place on the ship.

40:58.700 --> 41:01.400
Safe place. Yes, safe place,
my safe house.

41:01.500 --> 41:02.700
Open the door, Jenkins.

41:02.800 --> 41:04.300
You think it's funny?

41:04.500 --> 41:06.300
Turning tables, tables turned.

41:06.300 --> 41:09.000
I arrested you, now I'm
the one in the cage.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.600
You think that's funny, do you?

41:10.600 --> 41:11.000
Do you?

41:11.000 --> 41:13.500
I'll leave your ass here,
don't think I won't.

41:13.500 --> 41:16.000
You figure it out while we
clear the rest of the ship.

41:16.100 --> 41:17.900
Have this door open by
the time we get back.

41:17.900 --> 41:22.400
There's nothing to clear.
The crew is dead, everyone is dead.

41:22.500 --> 41:23.700
Darkness..

41:23.900 --> 41:29.700
Darkness is your friend, whatever
you do, don't turn on the lights.

41:34.900 --> 41:37.100
Let there be light!

41:38.700 --> 41:39.800
Yes!

41:47.200 --> 41:51.800
Varro to Chow, do not restart
the engine. Do you copy?

41:54.500 --> 41:56.700
Don't be afraid of the dark.

42:03.700 --> 42:05.400
Good job Chow.

42:05.600 --> 42:07.400
The bridge is free.

42:23.900 --> 42:24.900
Jace!..

42:26.100 --> 42:27.300
Grenade!

42:29.700 --> 42:30.300
Bugs!

42:30.500 --> 42:32.700
We got bugs, multiple contacts.

42:34.200 --> 42:35.000
Holy shit!

42:47.700 --> 42:49.900
Is that the abyss you
were talking about?

42:50.100 --> 42:51.600
Engine room, we're under attack.

42:51.600 --> 42:53.500
Take position, they're coming.

43:08.900 --> 43:11.800
Get back to the airlock,
move and fire.

43:18.700 --> 43:19.600
No..

43:24.600 --> 43:26.600
I'll draw them off, you go!

43:35.300 --> 43:36.100
No!

43:36.200 --> 43:38.000
We're not leaving him.

43:39.400 --> 43:41.600
Go, I'll see you on the other side.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.800
Holy Man, hold position and fire.

43:58.600 --> 43:59.900
Die bugs.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.800
You think I give a rat-ass about God?

44:05.700 --> 44:06.500
This way.

44:32.500 --> 44:34.700
Get to the airlock.

44:38.400 --> 44:42.500
We're headed to the airlock
and they're right on our ass.

44:42.600 --> 44:43.700
Roget that.

44:44.700 --> 44:45.600
God damn it!

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
Bugs.

45:37.200 --> 45:37.900
Chow!

45:41.100 --> 45:45.400
Alesia, we're under massive bug
attack. Request immediate evac.

45:45.500 --> 45:48.200
Repeat, request immediate evac.

45:49.200 --> 45:52.400
Roger that, Alesia is preparing
for your retrieval.

45:55.600 --> 45:56.700
Let's go!

46:00.400 --> 46:03.100
This is Alesia, ready for
your arrival, over.

46:14.100 --> 46:15.100
Contact!

46:20.600 --> 46:22.000
It's jammed!

46:40.400 --> 46:43.500
Don't suppose you have a good
replacement part to fix this.

46:46.200 --> 46:47.900
You're gonna make it..

46:48.100 --> 46:49.400
Oh that's right...

46:50.200 --> 46:54.600
You can't let me die. I'm the only one
of your patient who lived.

47:13.500 --> 47:14.900
Open the airlock.

47:18.700 --> 47:19.800
Shock Jock, you go first.

47:19.900 --> 47:20.900
Yes, sir.

47:29.400 --> 47:31.200
What the hell? Evasive action!

47:36.900 --> 47:38.000
Shock Jock!

47:41.700 --> 47:43.900
Close the door.

47:48.600 --> 47:50.300
What the hell just happen?

47:50.600 --> 47:52.000
The Alesia is gone.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.400
Did we just fire on them?

47:53.500 --> 47:56.600
Alesia, Captain Jonah, answer me!

48:02.900 --> 48:05.700
Listen up everybody,
we head to the bridge.

48:05.700 --> 48:06.400
Now!

48:09.000 --> 48:11.100
Since when did she give the orders?

48:11.100 --> 48:13.100
Since we boarded her ship.

48:13.200 --> 48:15.400
Just asking...

48:16.100 --> 48:16.600
Bugs!

48:26.900 --> 48:28.900
I act her so she hit me.

48:28.900 --> 48:31.300
I hacked her so she hit me.

48:31.300 --> 48:33.500
I hacked her so she hit me.

48:33.600 --> 48:35.400
I hacked her so she hit me.

48:35.400 --> 48:36.000
I hacked..

48:49.000 --> 48:50.700
Are you alright Captain?

48:51.100 --> 48:54.100
You know, if I wanted to
run this much..

48:54.500 --> 48:57.200
I'd have joined the mobile infantry.

49:00.800 --> 49:03.200
Captain Ibanez to the L6 Base.

49:03.900 --> 49:04.800
High Command?

49:05.200 --> 49:10.400
This is the John A. Warden,
Johnny? Please respond.

49:10.500 --> 49:13.500
Communications is always
jagging your word.

49:13.600 --> 49:17.000
Recommend we position ourselves
away from the Nebula.

49:17.100 --> 49:21.200
How did the cannon fire?
And why target our own ship?

49:21.300 --> 49:23.300
Jenkins tried to warn us.

49:23.600 --> 49:25.700
Carl is alive?

49:25.700 --> 49:27.100
Locked himself in the bug cage.

49:27.100 --> 49:29.500
And you're just now telling me this?

49:29.700 --> 49:30.800
Look, Captain..

49:30.900 --> 49:34.100
If you're ready for a full
debriefing, I'm all for it.

49:35.000 --> 49:35.700
Hero..

49:36.000 --> 49:41.100
Jenkins found a queen on Fort Casey.
He ordered us to capture it alive.

49:42.300 --> 49:43.300
What the...

49:43.300 --> 49:44.900
Tell her the rest.

49:45.300 --> 49:48.100
Yes Major, tell me the rest of it.

49:48.200 --> 49:51.900
I knew trying to take the queen
will resulting in heavy casualties

49:52.000 --> 49:55.500
I wasn't going to sacrifice
my men for a bug hunt.

49:55.600 --> 49:58.200
So that's why he had you arrested.

49:59.400 --> 50:01.500
But he got the queen after all.

50:02.000 --> 50:06.700
Wait a minute, how the hell can
a bug control a starship?

50:06.900 --> 50:09.400
You're going to have to
ask Jenkins that.

50:10.500 --> 50:11.300
What the?

50:30.700 --> 50:31.900
We're moving again.

50:31.900 --> 50:33.300
- Where?
- No idea.

50:33.400 --> 50:35.000
But if the queen is in control...

50:35.100 --> 50:36.500
We need to stop her
from getting there.

50:36.500 --> 50:37.200
How?

50:37.700 --> 50:39.800
Back to the engine room,
shut them down.

50:39.800 --> 50:41.900
Negative, not enough soldiers or ammo.

50:47.800 --> 50:49.500
What the hell are you doing?

50:53.500 --> 50:55.200
- Praying.
- Well, keep it up.

50:55.300 --> 50:57.300
We're going to need all
the help we can get.

51:06.900 --> 51:08.700
Now, we're back in business.

51:12.200 --> 51:13.300
Captain..

51:13.500 --> 51:15.800
You need to take a look at this.

51:20.000 --> 51:23.300
She's heading straight
for the Martian Home Wormhole.

51:24.800 --> 51:26.500
It will take her straight to Earth.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.300
This is Captain Ibanez to the L6 Base.

51:35.800 --> 51:38.800
Captain Ibanez calling L6 Base.

51:39.700 --> 51:42.000
This is Captain Ibanez to Johnny Rico.

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
L6 Base, come in.
This is Captain I....

51:50.400 --> 51:52.400
What the hell are you doing?

52:00.900 --> 52:04.900
If she is in the engine room,
then I'm gonna hunt her down.

52:05.400 --> 52:06.900
I'll back you up.

52:07.000 --> 52:07.700
No..

52:08.900 --> 52:09.800
You stay.

52:10.500 --> 52:13.800
Besides, you will never be
able to fit through here.

52:15.200 --> 52:17.200
I'll be back.

52:28.200 --> 52:30.600
You're not going to stop her?

52:30.700 --> 52:34.000
She's a big girl. She knows
what she's doing.

52:38.400 --> 52:39.800
Do we?

52:39.900 --> 52:42.300
I bypassed the circuit board,

52:42.300 --> 52:45.500
if we can gain control
with out being detected...

52:45.600 --> 52:47.400
Strap yourself in.

52:54.600 --> 52:56.500
I'm not gonna sit in that blood seat.

52:59.700 --> 53:00.800
Do it!

53:18.200 --> 53:19.700
She's on to us.

53:19.900 --> 53:20.900
Damn it!

53:25.700 --> 53:26.700
Fire!

54:33.400 --> 54:35.700
General, a Federation Starship is just

54:35.700 --> 54:38.000
emerged from Martian Home Wormhole.

54:38.000 --> 54:39.600
It's...

54:39.600 --> 54:42.500
- It's the John A. Warden.
- On screen.

54:42.700 --> 54:45.200
- They're receiving our signal sir.
- Any response?

54:45.300 --> 54:47.100
No sir, they're not responding.

54:48.500 --> 54:50.000
Something's wrong.

54:50.700 --> 54:53.300
Why would they head
back towards Earth?

54:54.400 --> 54:57.900
Sir, if they keep their current
trajectory, the John A. Warden..

54:57.900 --> 54:59.900
Sir, it's heading straight for us.

55:01.700 --> 55:04.800
John A. Warden, this is
General Rico, come in.

55:05.900 --> 55:08.500
John A. Warden, this is the L6 Base.

55:08.900 --> 55:11.500
If you do not change
course immediately,

55:11.500 --> 55:13.300
we will be forced to engage.

55:13.900 --> 55:17.000
Repeat, the L6 Base
will take defensive

55:17.000 --> 55:19.800
action if you do not change course.

55:20.600 --> 55:22.900
John A. Warden, respond!

55:27.800 --> 55:29.400
Talk to me Carmen.

55:48.100 --> 55:52.300
The L6 Base. We gotta warn Johnny.

55:55.700 --> 55:57.000
Morse code.

55:57.000 --> 56:00.000
We can't use the beacon, she
has control of the ship.

56:00.800 --> 56:01.500
Yeah?

56:02.600 --> 56:04.500
She doesn't have control of this.

56:13.800 --> 56:17.100
General, there's fire on the bridge
of the John A. Warden

56:17.200 --> 56:20.000
Get me a closer look at that ship.

56:28.700 --> 56:30.400
It's Morse code.

56:31.500 --> 56:33.800
They're trying to send us a message.

56:35.600 --> 56:38.400
Repeat, bugs in control.

56:42.200 --> 56:45.400
How the hell did bugs
control a starship?

56:48.800 --> 56:51.200
God damn you, Carl.

56:53.100 --> 56:55.200
Deployment status.

56:55.800 --> 56:59.200
Sheraton, Ishizu Therma and the
Franklin are heading to intercept.

57:32.900 --> 57:35.300
The Sheraton is taking
catastrophic damage.

57:51.400 --> 57:53.800
The Franklin is critical
but operational.

57:54.400 --> 57:58.400
Franklin, disengage. Get clear
of the John A. Warden.

58:16.100 --> 58:18.700
The John A. Warden is approaching
on a crash course.

58:19.200 --> 58:21.100
Ready to intercept sir.

58:21.200 --> 58:23.300
Main cannon armed and ready.

58:23.800 --> 58:25.200
Carmen...

58:27.900 --> 58:29.100
Carl..

58:29.600 --> 58:31.000
Commander..

58:35.000 --> 58:36.600
Open..

58:39.400 --> 58:40.300
Fire!

58:48.500 --> 58:49.200
Fire!

58:49.300 --> 58:52.400
Sir, we can't fire now,
they're too close.

59:11.500 --> 59:13.000
They missed us, sir.

59:13.300 --> 59:14.100
Yeah..

59:15.200 --> 59:16.500
But why?

59:17.000 --> 59:18.900
Commander, I have the
Warden's Trajectory,

59:18.900 --> 59:20.700
it's heading straight
for the earth.

59:22.100 --> 59:24.200
They never meant to ram us.

59:24.300 --> 59:26.100
We were just in their way.

59:31.400 --> 59:33.700
This is General Rico to
Earth Defense Command,

59:33.700 --> 59:35.700
the John A. Warden is
under bug control

59:35.700 --> 59:37.200
and entering Earth's atmosphere.

59:37.600 --> 59:40.900
It's what? The John A. Warden?

59:42.200 --> 59:45.600
Rico, I don't care if John A. Warden
is on that ship himself.

59:45.600 --> 59:48.700
If that ship is infested,
you take it down.

59:48.700 --> 59:50.700
Just give me a chance to do both, sir.

59:50.800 --> 59:54.000
Rescue our men and gain control.

59:54.000 --> 59:55.000
Rico..

59:55.100 --> 59:59.500
Commander, I promise, a bug invasion
will not happen on my watch, sir.

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:02.100
It better not!

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:06.500
Spaceborne command, prepare a drop.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:15.500
What now?

01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:19.900
Daugherty, you stay here
and protect the Captain.

01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:23.300
The rest of you, lock and load.

01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:26.700
It's time we exterminate that bitch.

01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:44.300
She's trying to crash the ship.

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:49.800
Do what you have to do.

01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:05.500
I don't know what to do.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.900
Trig, where are you now?

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:17.000
Trig, location.

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:19.600
Trig, come in.

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:22.300
Trig, respond.

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:26.000
- Where are you? Trig!
- Central storage area.

01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:28.600
- Have you found the queen?
- Oh yeah.

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:31.200
This bitch is disgusting.

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:33.300
Take her out.

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:34.600
Done.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.300
We're running out of time,.
Do you read me?

01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:40.100
Loud and clear, Captain.

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:52.400
Shit!

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:13.700
That's it.

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:32.200
No.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Shit!

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:54.300
438.

01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:56.100
439.

01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:58.900
440.

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:04.700
Trig...

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:07.100
All hands prepare for impact.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.400
Magnetic stabilizer disarm.

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:10.900
All hands, report.

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.000
Can anybody hear me?

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:16.900
Hero?

01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:19.100
Anybody?

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:30.100
Lieutenant..

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:49.200
Thank you.

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:09.000
Rico, you're not a trooper
anymore, remember that.

01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:11.500
I'm always a trooper.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000
And if there any of our
man alive on that ship,

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:17.900
I'm getting them out.

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.900
Should've known you'd said that.

01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:23.000
Kill them anyway you can.

01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:24.700
Kill them all.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000
In t-minus 30, we'll send
nukes to sanitize that site.

01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:33.700
So be out of there before we hit.

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:38.700
Don't wait for me, if I'm
not out in 30, nuke it.

01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:55.900
Ice..

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.300
Holy Man...

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.900
What the hell kinda bug is that?

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:10.000
Fuck me!

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:19.700
I was just starting to believe you.

01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:21.400
Fall back, now!

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:35.700
Troopers, our mission is to storm
the wreck of the John A. Warden,

01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:39.200
rescue our surviving men

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:41.700
and kill the last every last
son-of-bitch bugs we see.

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:45.100
- Do you understand?
- Yes sir!

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:48.900
We got 25 minutes before
they level that site,

01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:49.900
so move fast.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:52.100
And remember..

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:55.300
We're not fighting for some
rock across the galaxy,

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:57.900
we're fighting for our home.

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:00.100
Commence the attack.

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:23.200
Over here..

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:25.200
This way?

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.600
- Are you alright Captain?
- Yeah. Thanks.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.600
Come on, let's get to the airlock
and get out of here.

01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:02.900
That voice..

01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:14.300
Approaching...

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:15.600
Now!

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.700
Come on you apes.

01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:27.500
You wanna live forever?

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:30.000
Kill them all.

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:48.300
She still has the ship.

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:54.700
Ice, you guard the Captain.

01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:57.100
The rest of you are
coming with me,

01:08:57.100 --> 01:09:00.399
we're gonna kill the queen
and take back this ship.

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:02.399
Good luck.

01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:11.399
Don't worry, you see
your kids again soon.

01:09:11.399 --> 01:09:15.100
But those bugs, we're
taking their mama down.

01:09:21.399 --> 01:09:22.399
Holy shit!

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:23.600
Take evasive action!

01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:26.100
Incoming, burn and turn.

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:36.100
Listen...

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.200
It's the engine.

01:09:39.899 --> 01:09:43.500
- Mech, still have explosive?
- Some C-4.

01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:13.700
Trig...

01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:15.400
No..

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.500
Trig..

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.200
Trig!

01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:25.100
No...

01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:35.800
Ambush.

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:48.700
Go sir, I'll hold them off
for as long as I can.

01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:53.200
441.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.100
442.

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:56.800
443.

01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:59.200
444.

01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:36.800
Damn!

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:40.200
What the hell?

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:46.700
This is what I've been working on.

01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:54.400
T-minus 60 to launch,
starting final countdown.

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:58.400
56, 55, 54,

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:02.400
53, 52, 51

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.100
Carmen, get down!

01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:37.600
Johnny..

01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:40.900
Are there any other survivors?

01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:43.400
Four more, heading
to kill the queen.

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:45.500
And..

01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:49.100
Jenkins, you're still alive?

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:53.100
I can't die yet, not until we
won the war at least.

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:56.300
So, by controlling the bugs, you...

01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:59.400
I can bring us one step closer
to winning this war.

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:02.800
And I can get you close
enough to kill the queen.

01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:09.800
Then, let's get moving.

01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:34.000
Let negotiate.

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:36.400
Daugherty?

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:44.600
Surrender Jenkins to us

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:48.000
and we will let you live.

01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:50.800
They fear me.

01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:53.000
Maybe they just think you're an asshole.

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:55.300
Fuck off!

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:58.200
Then, you'll die.

01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:18.100
These are the last ones I
can control directly for now.

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:20.400
If I could've finished my research.

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:21.300
Then finish it

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:24.300
So, we can end this.

01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:27.200
- Run!
- What?

01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:29.500
I said run!

01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:43.100
3, 2, 1, launch.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.600
455.

01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:58.200
457.

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:00.300
458.

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:02.400
4-5...

01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:13.400
Carl..

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.300
Johnny Rico...

01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:31.800
I should leave your ass
here to get nuked.

01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:34.300
What do you mean nuked?

01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:35.500
Let's go.

01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:48.400
Johnny, the landing ship is here.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.100
I'm coming.

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:11.700
We lost contact with the landing ship.

01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:13.700
T-minus 15 till impact.

01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:25.200
Where's the ship?

01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:34.600
No...

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:50.800
They took out the nukes.

01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:07.000
S-she's won.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.800
- I still have one.
- One what?

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.200
The shuttle I used to evacuate from Fort Casey.

01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:16.700
Then let's use it.

01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:18.700
She'll never let us leave.

01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:25.300
You son-of-a-bitch.

01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:28.000
Now, that's not nice.

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:29.500
Tell her.

01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:31.600
I set explosive on
the main engine.

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:32.700
What?

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.500
- Mech, still have explosive?
- Some C-4.

01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:40.800
Good..

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:43.000
If we put C-4 in the main engine,

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.900
we can blow up the ship
and the queen with it.

01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:48.300
- Huh?
- Whoa..

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:51.800
We might not make it out in time.

01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:56.000
At least they won't.

01:17:57.100 --> 01:17:59.300
Okay..

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:01.700
Then do it.

01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:06.300
- Ratsazz, watch his back.
- Yes sir!

01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:11.100
So the extraction team been wiped out?

01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:14.700
Just 10 minutes left.

01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:19.500
Johnny what're you doing?

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:24.200
Get to the shuttle!

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:26.700
Johnny...

01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:30.000
Let's go.

01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:32.100
Follow me.

01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:52.400
Shit!

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.500
Are you Varro?

01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:08.000
Yes sir!

01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:09.700
Where's Jenkins?

01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:11.000
He's safe.

01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:15.100
Varro!

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:18.000
Good..

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:23.000
Make sure he keep everybody
else that way.

01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:07.500
He did it.

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:09.400
59 seconds.

01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:10.400
Where's Johnny?

01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:31.300
Captain, take us home.

01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:32.700
Aye, aye, sir.

01:21:50.900 --> 01:21:53.100
You're going to do it or what?

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:59.800
3, 2, 1,

01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:01.000
BOOM!

01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:54.200
I thought the good guys

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:56.700
and hot girls always
survive in the end.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.300
No..

01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:01.800
Not all of them.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.800
Here's to the dead.

01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:07.000
And to the next man to die.

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:16.700
I hope you feel better.

01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:21.800
Do you realize, that you not only
destroyed my ship, and killed my crew,

01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:26.200
but you also put the entire
planet at risk for infestation?

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:29.300
My apologies for your loss.

01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:32.000
But my research is going
to save an entire galaxy.

01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:35.700
Just like I saved you.

01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:40.900
It was you..

01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:43.700
You told me how to find Hero.

01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:47.300
Well, that's classified.

01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:51.200
You see, nothing can stop us when
the three of us are working together.

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:52.900
Are we, Carl?

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.400
Pardon me?

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:56.700
Are we working together?

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:00.700
Cheer up Johnny, you're a hero.

01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:02.400
No.

01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:04.100
No I'm not.

01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:07.800
But I've met one.
