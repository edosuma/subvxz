22:24.110 --> 22:26.465
CUTTING OFF THIS GUYS DICK OR

22:26.470 --> 22:30.611
MY OWN, I DECIDED THAT, UM,

22:30.620 --> 22:34.772
I DECIDED ON HIS.

22:34.780 --> 22:37.840
CHERRYS. SHE WAS A PRE-OP

22:37.850 --> 22:41.581
TRANSSEXUAL, AND MY FRIEND.

22:41.590 --> 22:44.753
>> OK. ANY OTHER DECISIONS?

22:44.760 --> 22:46.625
>> I DONT WANT TO DO THIS.

22:46.630 --> 22:48.621

23:01.650 --> 23:02.605
>> FINE. YOU WANT TO HEAR ABOUT

23:02.610 --> 23:04.407
MY BEST DECISION EVER?

23:04.410 --> 23:05.445
>> I DO.

23:10.380 --> 23:11.779
>> CHERRY HAD A GUN POINTED

23:11.790 --> 23:14.657
DIRECTLY AT THAT BASTARD, SHE

23:14.660 --> 23:16.582
WAS HESITANT AND UNSURE WHAT

23:16.590 --> 23:17.659
TO DO, I SHOULDVE GRABBED IT

23:17.660 --> 23:18.718
FROM HER, BUT INSTEAD, SHE

23:18.720 --> 23:20.529
SHOT HIM IN THE STOMACH.

23:20.530 --> 23:25.661
AND I LEFT HIM THERE TO ROT.

23:25.670 --> 23:27.524
GETTING CHERRY TO THE HOSPITAL

23:27.530 --> 23:28.667
WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE

23:28.670 --> 23:31.468
LIFE OF THAT SHIT STAIN.

23:31.480 --> 23:32.674
YOU CAN WRITE HIM CARE OF THE

23:32.680 --> 23:34.170
FLORIDA STATE PRISON SYSTEM,

23:34.180 --> 23:35.807
IF YOUD LIKE.

23:35.810 --> 23:37.402
>> THIS IS REALLY, REALLY GOOD,

23:45.820 --> 23:47.788
I MEAN, I LET MY DICK CHOOSE

23:47.790 --> 23:49.417
SOME PRETTY GIRL, AND I NEARLY

23:49.420 --> 23:50.819
GOT IT CUT OFF, YOU KNOW, AND

23:50.830 --> 23:52.422
THE WHOLE THING WITH CHERRY,

23:52.430 --> 23:54.091
AND THE SHOOTING, I MEAN, THAT

23:54.100 --> 23:55.419
WAS OUT OF MY HANDS. I NEVER

23:55.430 --> 23:56.829
HAD A CHOICE.

23:56.830 --> 23:59.492
>> CAN YOU REPEAT WHAT YOU JUST

24:00.640 --> 24:01.664
>> WHAT? THAT I NEVER HAD

24:01.670 --> 24:02.762
A CHOICE?

24:02.770 --> 24:03.759

25:03.970 --> 25:05.699
>> WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. HOLD ON.

25:05.700 --> 25:07.167
YOU ASKED US ALL TO GET

25:07.170 --> 25:08.694
TOGETHER FOR A DISCUSSION.

25:08.700 --> 25:09.928
NOT A PRESS STATEMENT.

25:09.930 --> 25:10.976
>> I DONT THINK YOURE READY

25:10.980 --> 25:12.129
TO STOP TREATMENT.

25:12.140 --> 25:13.129
>> NO. I DONT WANT TO

25:13.140 --> 25:15.870
STOP TREATMENT. I JUST WANT

25:15.880 --> 25:18.098
A DIFFERENT KIND OF TREATMENT.

25:42.910 --> 25:46.038
MY BODY OR INTO MY MIND HAS TO

BE MY DECISION. IM COMMITTED

28:52.960 --> 28:55.349
CHRISTIAN. I WAS NOTHING TO YOU.

28:55.360 --> 28:57.351
I WAS A FIXER UPPER THAT YOU

28:57.360 --> 28:59.351
COULD THROW A COAT OF PAINT ON.

28:59.360 --> 29:00.224
>> YOU ARE SUCH A FREAKING

29:00.230 --> 29:02.107
HYPOCRITE. YOURE THE ONE WHO

29:02.110 --> 29:03.304
SEDUCED ME WHEN YOU REALIZED

29:03.310 --> 29:04.265
I WAS A PLASTIC SURGEON

WHO COULD GET YOU EVERYTHING

29:05.270 --> 29:06.965
YOU WANTED.

29:06.970 --> 29:08.506
YOU WERE NEVER ANY MORE THAN

29:22.990 --> 29:23.979
>> LOOK, WHATEVER I DID...

29:23.990 --> 29:27.255
WHATEVER WE DID TO EACH OTHER...

29:27.260 --> 29:31.492
I LOVED YOU.

29:31.500 --> 29:33.968
>> YOU LOVED YOUR CREATION.

29:33.970 --> 29:35.392
YOU NEVER LOVED ME BECAUSE YOU

29:35.400 --> 29:37.994
NEVER SAW WHO I REALLY WAS.

29:38.000 --> 29:38.989
I WAS JUST SOMETHING MADE UP

29:39.000 --> 29:39.534
IN YOUR HEAD.

29:39.540 --> 29:41.508
>> WELL, I SEE YOU NOW, KIMBER.

29:41.510 --> 29:44.308
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? YOURE

29:44.310 --> 29:48.007
DANGEROUS. BECAUSE YOURE WEAK.

29:48.010 --> 29:50.444
YOU CANT SURVIVE WITHOUT

29:50.450 --> 29:51.553
SOMEONE OR SOMETHING TO

29:51.560 --> 29:54.188
SUCK OFF. A NEW LOVER, A NEW

29:54.190 --> 29:56.249
RELIGION. BUT IF YOU START

29:56.260 --> 30:01.493
FEEDING ON MY SON, I SWEAR,

31:19.340 --> 31:20.398
>> OH, COME ON. TAKE A LOOK.

31:20.400 --> 31:21.606
ITS OBVIOUS THAT BLU MONDAE
