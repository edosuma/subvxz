WEBVTT

00:01.896 --> 00:04.545
 Ms. Blaine, we're
suspending Taylor from school.

00:04.545 --> 00:05.865
There were pictures posted
of your son

00:05.865 --> 00:07.155
which were
outside the code.

00:07.155 --> 00:08.844
There was a party.
It was for the basketball team.

00:08.853 --> 00:10.936
<i>He was really
messed up.</i>

00:10.936 --> 00:12.594
I think
someone did something to me.

00:12.594 --> 00:14.508
A student is claiming
to have been assaulted.

00:14.508 --> 00:15.659
By one of my players?

00:15.669 --> 00:17.556
Don't think your kids
are above mistakes.

00:17.556 --> 00:19.946
We have to make it clear
we take this matter seriously.

00:19.936 --> 00:21.355
911.
What's your emergency?

00:21.365 --> 00:22.786
I want to report a rape.

00:22.786 --> 00:23.907
That little bitch
said something.

00:23.916 --> 00:25.176
It's nothing.
Well, it's nothing for you.

00:25.176 --> 00:26.337
They're not doing anything
to you.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.639
Do you know what they are saying
about him online?

00:28.648 --> 00:30.178
 Kevin's 18.
They can print his name.

00:30.168 --> 00:31.984
 We're in debt because of
that school, and for what?

00:31.994 --> 00:33.353
Eric's grades are good.

00:33.353 --> 00:35.307
He's been different ever since
he started going there.

00:35.307 --> 00:36.698
You said that thing in the paper
would help.

00:36.698 --> 00:38.184
They're going online,
they're saying stuff.

00:38.184 --> 00:39.347
I don't want
to go to Leyland anymore.

00:39.347 --> 00:40.736
I want to go
back to Marshall.

00:40.736 --> 00:43.087
The testing's come back
from Taylor Blaine's clothes.

00:43.087 --> 00:44.843
We're officially
looking at this as a rape.

00:45.896 --> 00:47.781
Kevin k.: To the journalist
who asked me

00:47.781 --> 00:50.859
<i>if I was sure
that I was raped --</i>

00:50.869 --> 00:55.730
<i>I mean really sure --</i>

00:55.730 --> 00:57.872
you're right.

00:57.882 --> 01:00.693
I don't remember
what my rapist was wearing.

01:00.702 --> 01:03.649
I don't remember
how much I had to drink.

01:03.649 --> 01:06.297
I don't remember
what time it was,

01:06.297 --> 01:12.123
how long it lasted,
or how he held me.

01:12.123 --> 01:16.201
I do remember
that the word "rape"

01:16.191 --> 01:19.368
never felt like it belonged
to me in the first place...

01:20.398 --> 01:22.552
...or after
the responding officers

01:22.552 --> 01:23.844
rolled their eyes

01:23.844 --> 01:25.956
<i>or after you asked me</i>

01:25.966 --> 01:29.807
if I was sure
that a man could be raped.

01:29.807 --> 01:32.784
I mean really raped.

01:32.784 --> 01:35.969
I'm sure that
I remember it feeling like

01:35.959 --> 01:41.020
every room of my home being
broken into at the same time.

01:41.030 --> 01:42.420
 I'm sure that I had to start

01:42.420 --> 01:45.803
speaking in metaphor for you
to start listening.

01:45.793 --> 01:50.785
I'm sure that man and woman
is not all a body can be.

01:50.794 --> 01:54.327
I'm sure it does not matter.

01:54.337 --> 01:56.024
It does not matter.

01:59.308 --> 02:04.043
Remember how I told you
that it felt like

02:04.043 --> 02:08.508
every room of my home being
broken into at the same time.

02:10.234 --> 02:13.648
Remember how busy you were

02:13.637 --> 02:18.471
trying to figure out
how they got in

02:18.481 --> 02:24.306
that you forgot all about
the person living there.

02:32.978 --> 02:37.285
Light damage to sphincter area,
lacerations around anus...

02:37.285 --> 02:40.104
-You don't need to keep going.
-...Blood and semen on his underpants.

02:40.094 --> 02:43.239
They found someone else's semen
on that boy's clothes.

02:43.239 --> 02:46.216
I warned you something happened,
but you were so certain --

02:46.226 --> 02:47.645
th-that doesn't prove
anything happened.

02:47.645 --> 02:49.036
Nothing?
If that was your daughter...

02:49.036 --> 02:50.187
Don't talk
about my daughter.

02:50.196 --> 02:51.545
...and they found evidence
on her clothes --

02:51.555 --> 02:53.838
don't be defensive.

02:53.838 --> 02:55.326
I'm not accusing you.

02:55.326 --> 02:57.966
I'm asking you to face
the reality of the situation.

02:57.975 --> 03:00.217
Either your whole team
is deceiving you,

03:00.227 --> 03:02.471
or one person is deceiving
that whole team.

03:02.481 --> 03:04.109
If they don't respect you
enough to t--

03:04.109 --> 03:05.170
they respect me.

03:05.160 --> 03:06.749
They lied to you.

03:06.749 --> 03:07.899
This is the truth.

03:07.909 --> 03:10.122
The truth is winning.

03:10.132 --> 03:14.368
The police want DNA samples
from the team.

03:14.368 --> 03:15.958
If they can't get them
willingly,

03:15.958 --> 03:17.783
they'll make arrests
and file charges.

03:17.783 --> 03:19.439
You really want to see
these kids

03:19.429 --> 03:22.834
paraded in front of cameras
in handcuffs?

03:22.844 --> 03:24.073
Who did this?

03:24.073 --> 03:26.724
We need to give
the police a name.

03:26.715 --> 03:27.707
Any name?

03:27.717 --> 03:28.976
Don't get petty.

03:28.966 --> 03:30.158
Well,
don't you get righteous.

03:30.158 --> 03:31.646
We need to take a minute
and figure out

03:31.656 --> 03:33.442
the best opportunity
to give these boys a chance

03:33.442 --> 03:34.661
to explain
what really happened.

03:34.661 --> 03:35.814
They've had it.

03:35.823 --> 03:37.749
Being sentimental,
trying to be their friend --

03:37.749 --> 03:39.137
that's done what?

03:39.137 --> 03:42.284
They need to understand we have
the capacity to manage this.

03:42.284 --> 03:44.238
Y-you -- you and the board --
you're --

03:44.238 --> 03:46.889
you're over here, away from
everybody else, all right?

03:46.889 --> 03:48.743
And you want us
to go take the hill,

03:48.733 --> 03:50.024
and whatever happens
happens.

03:50.024 --> 03:52.634
We're asking you
to do what needs to be done

03:52.644 --> 03:54.300
to take care of everyone.

03:54.300 --> 03:57.149
We can't do that if people
aren't acting in concert.

03:57.149 --> 03:59.570
Do you understand that?

03:59.560 --> 04:02.735
Nobody is trying to hurt
your boys.

04:02.745 --> 04:04.433
We're trying to put them
in a position

04:04.433 --> 04:08.005
where we can use the resources
we have to protect them.

04:08.005 --> 04:13.036
<i>So you need to explain to them
 this is it,</i>

04:13.036 --> 04:15.785
<i>or not only
will we not protect them --</i>

04:15.785 --> 04:18.334
<i>we will put them
front and center.</i>

04:18.334 --> 04:20.678
If that's what it takes
to stop the bleeding,

04:20.688 --> 04:22.532
that's what it takes.

04:30.591 --> 04:32.248
 You lied.

04:32.248 --> 04:35.720
You lied to me.

04:35.720 --> 04:39.006
This captains' party --
you all -- you --

04:38.996 --> 04:42.935
you looked me in the eyes,
and you swore nothing happened.

04:42.935 --> 04:46.339
Something happened
at that party.

04:46.349 --> 04:48.989
The police have got semen
on this kid.

04:48.999 --> 04:50.556
They've got blood.

04:50.556 --> 04:53.107
And I told you that you could
come to me, and I would help.

04:53.107 --> 04:54.734
I told you that,
and what do you do?

04:54.723 --> 04:56.540
You turn around --
all of you turn around,

04:56.550 --> 04:57.712
and you make me look stupid.

04:57.712 --> 04:59.029
You make me look stupid,

04:59.029 --> 05:01.086
and you make everybody else
look guilty.

05:01.086 --> 05:05.719
The police are gonna start
making arrests.

05:05.719 --> 05:07.863
They're gonna start
taking samples.

05:07.873 --> 05:10.453
And you think the people who run
this school care about you?

05:10.453 --> 05:12.894
They're gonna cut you loose.

05:12.904 --> 05:14.650
And when they do,
I can't help you.

05:14.660 --> 05:15.950
Lesean: One of y'all better
say something.

05:15.950 --> 05:17.072
I got college next year.

05:17.082 --> 05:18.569
I ain't finna to let none
of y'all mess that up.

05:18.569 --> 05:19.859
Maybe you need to talk.

05:19.859 --> 05:20.853
-I'm sorry. What?
-Yeah. Yeah.

05:20.853 --> 05:22.342
Yeah, somebody skeetin'
on that boy.

05:22.342 --> 05:24.256
I know it wasn't me.
-Well, I know it wasn't me.

05:25.983 --> 05:27.699
Hey! Hey! Sit down! Sit down!

05:27.709 --> 05:29.525
Wes, sit your ass down!

05:36.352 --> 05:38.665
You got something to say,
say it.

05:40.000 --> 05:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:50.980 --> 05:54.298
Warrants are coming.

05:54.298 --> 05:58.333
You think any of you know
how bad this is?

05:58.342 --> 06:02.611
I'm telling you right now.

06:02.611 --> 06:05.053
You think it was ugly before?

06:05.053 --> 06:07.885
This is where some hell begins.

06:57.205 --> 06:59.619
 He just showed up here,
but he's not saying much,

06:59.619 --> 07:02.422
just something about that party
and the police.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.278
They want to talk to him. -Why do
the police want to talk to Eric?

07:04.278 --> 07:06.135
Well, not just him --
the whole team.

07:06.135 --> 07:07.697
Should we let him?

07:07.697 --> 07:08.772
I don't know.

07:08.781 --> 07:11.448
Well, should we
Wh-wh-what do we do?

07:11.448 --> 07:12.972
I need to ask around,

07:12.982 --> 07:14.584
find out what other families
are doing,

07:14.584 --> 07:16.897
maybe...Get a lawyer.

07:16.888 --> 07:18.481
How are we gonna pay
for a lawyer?

07:18.491 --> 07:21.489
I'll figure something out.

07:21.489 --> 07:22.955
I'll take him home.

07:22.955 --> 07:25.173
Drop him at my place.

07:25.173 --> 07:26.344
I'll take him home.

07:26.344 --> 07:30.291
Would you just...Give him
some space to think?

07:30.291 --> 07:31.922
Just take him to my place.

07:39.875 --> 07:41.994
Hey.

07:41.994 --> 07:43.879
Come on. Let's go.

07:46.682 --> 07:47.942
First thing that the police

07:47.952 --> 07:49.477
are going to try to do
is secure warrants.

07:49.487 --> 07:50.980
They'll collect
the buccal swabs,

07:50.990 --> 07:52.622
and then, most likely,
the prosecutor

07:52.612 --> 07:54.330
will go public
with his investigation.

07:54.340 --> 07:55.834
So, the papers
and these bloggers --

07:55.844 --> 07:57.896
they're gonna just keep writing
things about Kevin?

07:57.896 --> 07:58.873
Michael:
That needs to stop.

07:58.873 --> 08:00.210
We have to
get in front of this.

08:00.210 --> 08:02.360
C-can we get Kevin to do
a polygraph test?

08:02.360 --> 08:03.767
Can we put that out there?

08:03.767 --> 08:05.134
Just give them the sample.

08:05.134 --> 08:07.576
I wouldn't have Kevin offer up
any evidence.

08:07.576 --> 08:10.448
Unfortunately,
that can come back on him.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.763
If I was going to
offer up any advice,

08:12.754 --> 08:14.931
you want to position Kevin
as being able

08:14.941 --> 08:16.310
to corroborate any charges

08:16.310 --> 08:18.517
the police may bring against
anyone else.

08:18.526 --> 08:20.060
You want Kevin to snitch.

08:20.060 --> 08:21.525
I want to keep Kevin
out of jail.

08:21.525 --> 08:25.277
If he needs to make a statement,
he'll make it.

08:25.277 --> 08:28.050
Do it. Set it up.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.829
My son, Taylor -- the --

08:29.839 --> 08:32.318
the reason he's coming back
to Marshall --

08:32.308 --> 08:34.486
why he -- he wants
to come back --

08:34.496 --> 08:37.369
there were, uh, some challenges
at his other school.

08:37.369 --> 08:38.669
Academic challenges?

08:38.669 --> 08:40.485
It just --
it just wasn't a good fit.

08:40.495 --> 08:41.638
He didn't fit in.

08:41.638 --> 08:43.727
There -- there --
there was some bullying

08:43.719 --> 08:45.967
and, uh,
some other challenges.

08:45.977 --> 08:47.997
Other challenges?

08:52.588 --> 08:55.031
You're asking me
to help your son.

08:55.031 --> 08:57.374
I can't do that
if I don't know his situation.

08:59.104 --> 09:01.447
He was assaulted.
It was at a party.

09:01.447 --> 09:05.873
There was, uh, pictures
and some online bullying.

09:05.883 --> 09:07.475
That was your son
in that article?

09:09.606 --> 09:11.724
I just want to know
that he'll be safe here.

09:15.407 --> 09:19.051
I can have Taylor meet with our
school counselor, Mrs. Murray.

09:19.051 --> 09:21.160
She can help him
get situated.

09:21.170 --> 09:22.567
But if he has problems,

09:22.577 --> 09:24.921
he's going to have to be active
in trying to get them resolved.

09:24.921 --> 09:26.328
You see,
he's always been quiet.

09:26.318 --> 09:28.008
He doesn't --
he doesn't like to talk.

09:28.018 --> 09:29.874
Boys his age never do.

09:29.874 --> 09:32.160
Look, I know some people
at Leyland.

09:32.160 --> 09:33.947
I can check out
his situation,

09:33.947 --> 09:35.833
but I've got
over 2,000 students,

09:35.843 --> 09:37.864
35 kids to a classroom.

09:37.864 --> 09:40.765
It's hard for us to help
these kids one-on-one.

09:40.755 --> 09:41.762
Mm.

09:43.560 --> 09:46.461
Okay.

09:46.461 --> 09:47.887
I'll do what I can
for your son,

09:47.897 --> 09:49.616
but he's got to bring
his needs to us.

10:01.328 --> 10:02.891
Come on.

10:02.891 --> 10:04.619
I sit with the principal.

10:04.619 --> 10:07.618
He tells me he's got 2,000 kids,
can't look out for Taylor.

10:07.618 --> 10:08.957
He'll be okay.

10:10.255 --> 10:13.088
I thought going to that school
would be such a good thing.

10:13.088 --> 10:15.991
I wanted him
to get into a good college.

10:15.991 --> 10:17.385
I just messed up.

10:17.395 --> 10:19.418
You know that's not true.

10:19.418 --> 10:20.561
You know it.

10:22.768 --> 10:24.947
Hey, you want to go up
to Chicago next weekend?

10:24.957 --> 10:26.949
Yeah, we'll get
a nice hotel room --

10:26.949 --> 10:28.836
I mean
like Sheraton nice --

10:28.836 --> 10:31.932
do some room service,
mm, go to a spa.

10:33.075 --> 10:34.540
I can't take off work.

10:34.540 --> 10:35.654
I can't leave Taylor.

10:35.644 --> 10:37.137
Nate could
keep an eye on him.

10:37.147 --> 10:37.968
Nate?

10:37.959 --> 10:39.385
Yeah?

10:39.395 --> 10:41.671
You want to keep an eye
on Taylor?

10:41.681 --> 10:45.949
Sure. Yeah. I'd love to.

10:45.949 --> 10:47.219
I-I can't leave him.

10:47.219 --> 10:50.481
Leaving him brings up
bad memories.

10:50.481 --> 10:52.534
You know, you got to
look out for you, too.

10:54.946 --> 10:57.485
It would be good.

10:57.485 --> 11:00.581
I would love if Taylor spent
more time with Nate.

11:00.581 --> 11:03.221
Yeah. Of course.

11:03.221 --> 11:06.473
It would be good, you know,
for him to have a man around.

11:07.752 --> 11:10.136
You regret not making it
work out with Taylor's dad?

11:11.659 --> 11:13.710
This was the guy --
I was with him for a month.

11:13.720 --> 11:16.231
He talks me into having sex
with him without a condom.

11:16.231 --> 11:18.449
Two weeks later,
I'm -- I'm late on my period,

11:18.439 --> 11:20.226
peeing on
a pregnancy stick.

11:20.236 --> 11:23.722
All he says to me is,
"you got to get rid of it."

11:23.722 --> 11:26.107
I mean,
he kept saying "it."

11:26.107 --> 11:27.738
I mean, you know
how I feel about that.

11:27.728 --> 11:28.929
Yeah, I know.

11:28.939 --> 11:33.599
Abortion's not how
I was gonna solve things.

11:33.599 --> 11:37.086
All I would have
done different...

11:37.086 --> 11:40.183
Was gotten with somebody
who wanted to be a man.

11:42.206 --> 11:44.686
Whenever Taylor's ready,
sure.

11:44.676 --> 11:46.112
We both miss him.

11:46.112 --> 11:48.750
We'd love to be in his life
a lot more.

12:07.230 --> 12:11.039
 I really appreciate you
taking time to talk about Eric.

12:11.049 --> 12:12.974
He's a good kid.

12:12.974 --> 12:14.508
He's got
a lot of opportunities.

12:14.508 --> 12:17.272
If he keeps playing
how he's been playing, I mean --

12:17.272 --> 12:20.136
you called and said it was
urgent that we should talk.

12:20.146 --> 12:21.902
Eric showed up
at my work.

12:21.902 --> 12:25.752
He said that the police want
to interview the team, get DNA.

12:25.752 --> 12:27.637
Yeah, we're aware.

12:27.637 --> 12:33.372
I was, uh -- I was thinking
it might be in our best interest

12:33.372 --> 12:34.640
if our families came together
on this.

12:34.650 --> 12:35.949
"Our best interest"?

12:35.949 --> 12:40.219
Well, Eric and Kevin --
they're team captains.

12:40.219 --> 12:41.517
They both
threw the party.

12:41.527 --> 12:42.827
They both
threw the party,

12:42.827 --> 12:44.417
but Kevin's name
is the only one

12:44.427 --> 12:47.916
that's being slandered
right now.

12:47.916 --> 12:51.334
Well, Eric was suspended
from the team.

12:51.334 --> 12:56.160
They've both -- you know
[Sighs] they've both suffered.

12:56.160 --> 12:58.153
This is really important.

12:58.144 --> 13:00.195
Basketball is important
to Eric -- to both of them.

13:00.204 --> 13:02.227
I don't give a damn
about basketball.

13:02.217 --> 13:04.199
Kevin has a 3.6 gpa,

13:04.209 --> 13:07.599
and he's going to nyu
with or without basketball.

13:07.599 --> 13:11.447
Only now, nyu and every other
university can look online

13:11.447 --> 13:14.905
and see how my son,
not yours -- our son --

13:14.895 --> 13:17.698
is involved with
a sexual assault.

13:17.698 --> 13:20.893
What do you think
that does to his future?

13:20.893 --> 13:23.492
Every parent
with a kid on that team --

13:23.502 --> 13:26.267
every other kid on that team
is not our concern.

13:28.786 --> 13:30.584
Can I be honest?

13:32.957 --> 13:35.439
I'm going through a divorce.

13:35.429 --> 13:38.554
And money has been very tight.

13:38.563 --> 13:40.489
Hello?

13:40.489 --> 13:41.690
Well, did you e-mail it?

13:41.690 --> 13:43.380
'Cause we --
I haven't seen it.

13:43.390 --> 13:44.787
Well,
you need to send it again

13:44.787 --> 13:46.799
because we need to get it back
before morning,

13:46.809 --> 13:48.704
and this is the third time
you've told me...

13:48.704 --> 13:50.950
I can't get a lawyer.

13:54.731 --> 13:57.075
I don't have the money.

13:57.075 --> 13:59.850
And I don't want Eric to suffer
because I can't --

13:59.850 --> 14:01.411
I can get you the names
of some lawyers,

14:01.411 --> 14:04.147
but we've already consulted
legal counsel.

14:04.147 --> 14:06.950
Kevin will have his side
of the story,

14:06.950 --> 14:08.778
and I think your son
should have his.

14:22.757 --> 14:26.399
I'm gonna make an appointment
for us to go see the police.

14:26.409 --> 14:28.461
You need to tell the detectives
what you know.

14:28.461 --> 14:30.736
I'm not talking to the cops.

14:30.745 --> 14:31.693
Why not?

14:31.693 --> 14:33.189
'Cause.

14:33.189 --> 14:36.285
No. Don't do that.
Why not?

14:36.285 --> 14:38.082
I got nothing
to say to them.

14:40.456 --> 14:42.273
Go in your room.

14:42.283 --> 14:43.914
I don't have a room anymore.
I got to share with --

14:43.914 --> 14:45.740
go somewhere.

15:02.786 --> 15:05.268
They're gonna start
arresting people.

15:05.258 --> 15:07.993
They're gonna start
taking samples.

15:08.002 --> 15:09.467
How come
you won't say anything?

15:09.467 --> 15:11.422
You trying to protect
somebody on the team? -No.

15:11.422 --> 15:13.444
Because nobody's trying
to protect you.

15:13.444 --> 15:15.691
They're looking out
for themselves.

15:16.706 --> 15:18.298
Those families,
the whole school --

15:18.298 --> 15:21.033
-I don't care about them. -They're
looking to blame somebody.

15:21.033 --> 15:23.632
You think they're your friends?
They're not.

15:23.642 --> 15:25.499
You think they care about you?
They don't.

15:25.499 --> 15:26.796
That's not true, dad.

15:26.806 --> 15:28.046
I talked
to Kevin's parents.

15:28.046 --> 15:30.197
He's already got
his story.

15:30.197 --> 15:32.286
He's got lawyers.

15:32.276 --> 15:33.899
All you have is me.

15:33.909 --> 15:35.920
So tell me
what's going on.

15:35.930 --> 15:36.868
You don't get it.

15:36.877 --> 15:40.267
Then help me
do something for you.

15:40.267 --> 15:42.289
You can't even fix what's
going on with you and mom.

15:58.485 --> 16:00.664
Let's just
get it over with.

16:00.673 --> 16:03.380
We go to the station,
we talk it out,

16:03.380 --> 16:04.746
and everything
will be fine.

16:14.455 --> 16:15.697
What do you think?

16:15.697 --> 16:17.456
That's never a good sign.

16:17.456 --> 16:18.724
One of two things --

16:18.724 --> 16:21.196
either the play stinks,
or I'm too stupid to get it.

16:21.206 --> 16:22.447
It's not you.

16:22.447 --> 16:23.453
I don't know.

16:23.453 --> 16:25.249
Me and the arts
have never been...

16:25.249 --> 16:26.383
Can I tell you?

16:26.383 --> 16:28.200
You are gonna love this
performance piece

16:28.210 --> 16:30.262
we are putting on --
it is so beautiful.

16:30.262 --> 16:32.049
You're really going through
with that?

16:32.058 --> 16:33.855
Going through with it?
Why wouldn't we?

16:33.846 --> 16:35.956
Personally, I'd want things
to settle down a little bit.

16:35.966 --> 16:37.460
There's a lot the school
is dealing with.

16:37.470 --> 16:38.965
One has nothing to do
with the other.

16:38.965 --> 16:40.040
One affects the other.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.149
Kids accused
of raping another boy.

16:42.159 --> 16:44.532
I deal with that every day.
Can we just --

16:44.542 --> 16:45.812
that gala seems
a little tone-deaf.

16:45.812 --> 16:48.097
Accused.
No one's been charged.

16:48.097 --> 16:49.104
No one may ever be.

16:49.104 --> 16:50.247
Now you're deflecting.

16:50.247 --> 16:51.546
I'm not deflecting.

16:51.546 --> 16:52.846
I can complete
your sentence.

16:52.856 --> 16:55.620
And it's something about
resigning or quitting

16:55.620 --> 16:57.016
or not finishing
my work.

16:57.026 --> 16:58.071
That school is a mess.

16:58.071 --> 16:59.762
You can't fix everything
with a deft response

16:59.762 --> 17:01.226
and an obsessive-compulsive
nature.

17:01.226 --> 17:03.112
And not every private
institution

17:03.122 --> 17:04.518
is filled with entitled...

17:04.518 --> 17:07.282
Who tease and bully a girl
until she has a breakdown.

17:07.292 --> 17:08.924
Hey. Hey.
-Ugh.

17:08.924 --> 17:10.388
What about our arrangement?

17:10.388 --> 17:13.974
Or does that only apply when
you want to be honest with me?

17:13.974 --> 17:15.635
What happened
with your daughter --

17:15.635 --> 17:18.575
that was stupid kids
doing stupid things,

17:18.565 --> 17:19.894
but I talk to her.

17:19.903 --> 17:21.915
I see how strong
she is now.

17:21.925 --> 17:23.820
I watched deana get wrecked.
I stood there.

17:23.820 --> 17:27.074
I stood there oblivious,
like an idiot,

17:27.074 --> 17:31.078
until it was too late
to do anything about it.

17:32.095 --> 17:34.966
So I'm not saying nothing
this time.

17:34.966 --> 17:36.207
It's not the same.

17:37.925 --> 17:41.344
I'm not gonna stand there
and watch --

17:41.354 --> 17:43.572
and watch you get torn up.

17:48.876 --> 17:52.784
I'm sentimental, Leslie.

17:52.793 --> 17:55.137
I shouldn't have to beg you
to marry me.

18:14.918 --> 18:16.969
Are you excited
to be back at Marshall?

18:19.060 --> 18:20.487
I guess, yeah.

18:20.497 --> 18:23.426
Principal Dixon said you had
some problems over at Leyland?

18:23.426 --> 18:24.657
Yeah.

18:24.667 --> 18:27.178
He said your mother had some
concerns about you...

18:27.178 --> 18:28.418
I don't really want
to talk about this.

18:28.418 --> 18:29.590
My mom -- she --

18:29.590 --> 18:32.032
-okay. Okay. Okay.
-She's dealing with a lot.

18:32.032 --> 18:33.331
You don't have to
talk about it,

18:33.341 --> 18:35.462
but if you ever want to,
just know that there are --

18:35.452 --> 18:36.946
I will. Thank you.

18:47.417 --> 18:50.484
Is there anything in particular
you want to do this semester?

18:53.191 --> 18:54.977
Just get through it.

18:54.977 --> 18:58.133
What about after that?
Are you thinking about college?

19:00.262 --> 19:03.164
Nothing?

19:03.164 --> 19:08.215
I'm -- I'm just trying
to go day by day right now.

19:17.143 --> 19:18.802
Well,
this is a fresh start.

19:18.802 --> 19:22.085
This is an opportunity
for you to focus on you

19:22.095 --> 19:24.664
and what you want
to accomplish.

19:24.673 --> 19:27.057
So, what do you want
to accomplish?

19:30.339 --> 19:31.374
What's up, chica?

19:31.383 --> 19:33.368
Nothing.

19:33.377 --> 19:34.940
What you doing later on?

19:34.940 --> 19:35.956
None of your business.

19:37.119 --> 19:39.727
Well, I'm trying to see
what vanillas taste like.

19:39.727 --> 19:42.823
Ew. Get off me!

19:42.823 --> 19:45.753
-Hey, hold up!

19:45.763 --> 19:46.575
You good?

19:46.575 --> 19:47.776
Yeah.

19:47.785 --> 19:49.182
Lil thuggie up on you?

19:49.182 --> 19:50.590
He's just talking trash.

19:50.590 --> 19:51.624
About the police
coming to see you?

19:51.624 --> 19:52.923
Mateo, it's cool.

19:52.932 --> 19:54.232
Bitch got a mouth.

19:54.232 --> 19:55.923
Just leave it alone.

20:06.354 --> 20:08.865
So, there's nothing we can do
to help out Eric?

20:08.865 --> 20:11.727
Like what?

20:11.736 --> 20:14.902
He's my boy, and I -- I know
I threw that party, too.

20:14.902 --> 20:17.021
This isn't about
who threw the party.

20:17.021 --> 20:20.148
Well, I just -- I don't want him
to get in trouble because...

20:20.148 --> 20:22.727
I just don't want him
to get in trouble.

20:22.717 --> 20:24.446
Let me tell you something.

20:24.446 --> 20:25.646
That boy will always get

20:25.656 --> 20:27.610
a benefit of the doubt
that you won't.

20:27.610 --> 20:28.558
It's not like that.

20:28.558 --> 20:30.022
Yeah?

20:30.022 --> 20:32.309
Young black men and the law --
that's all been worked out?

20:32.299 --> 20:33.472
It's not the same.

20:33.481 --> 20:34.780
No, it's not the same

20:34.780 --> 20:37.389
because we're not gonna
leave you for the police.

20:37.389 --> 20:39.284
You get to go in there
with a lawyer

20:39.274 --> 20:42.430
your father and I
paid for.

20:42.438 --> 20:45.075
You're the one
who's always saying,

20:45.075 --> 20:47.255
"be a man.
Do the right thing."

20:48.603 --> 20:49.873
Do you know for certain

20:49.873 --> 20:52.315
that no one on that team
touched that boy?

20:57.405 --> 21:01.448
Then doing the right thing
is taking care of yourself

21:01.439 --> 21:02.611
because those other boys --

21:02.620 --> 21:04.505
they're not gonna do
anything for you.

21:12.690 --> 21:14.548
"At about 9:00 P.M...

21:14.548 --> 21:15.788
Fred.

21:15.788 --> 21:17.741
...an event known as the
captains' party took place

21:17.741 --> 21:20.252
at the grove, on 1629 Delancy.

21:20.252 --> 21:21.396
During the party,

21:21.386 --> 21:23.466
somewhere between 10:00 P.M.
and 1:00 A.M.,

21:23.475 --> 21:27.128
an incident which the police are
now investigating took place.

21:27.128 --> 21:29.306
While I have every intention
of fully cooperating

21:29.306 --> 21:30.606
with the police in this matter,

21:30.616 --> 21:33.907
I personally was not a witness
to the alleged assault.

21:33.907 --> 21:35.989
At that time
of the alleged assault,

21:35.989 --> 21:38.332
I was with a friend --
Valerie --

21:38.342 --> 21:42.024
and we had self-segregated
from the main body of the party.

21:42.024 --> 21:44.468
Valerie can account
of my whereabouts.

21:44.468 --> 21:46.684
By the time we returned
to the party, the accuser,

21:46.684 --> 21:49.391
who I have previously witnessed
consuming alcohol,

21:49.391 --> 21:53.533
was passed out on the floor."

21:55.710 --> 21:58.348
"Members of the basketball team
were surrounding the accuser,

21:58.348 --> 22:00.331
taking pictures.

22:00.341 --> 22:04.189
Those pictures were later posted
on social networks.

22:04.189 --> 22:06.240
And I did not participate
in the activity,

22:06.240 --> 22:07.775
and I tried the best I could

22:07.775 --> 22:10.930
to get them to cease
their activities."

22:13.704 --> 22:15.099
"The accuser was helped
from the space,

22:15.099 --> 22:18.842
and I have no knowledge
of any other events."

22:22.368 --> 22:23.891
Anything you'd like to add?

22:31.071 --> 22:33.611
No. That's it.

22:58.813 --> 23:00.250
Back up, bitch!

23:00.250 --> 23:01.255
Shut it!

23:01.255 --> 23:02.271
Bitch-ass nigger!

23:04.548 --> 23:06.111
You just don't know
when to shut it, do you?

23:06.111 --> 23:07.898
Come here.

23:07.908 --> 23:09.598
That one down there is bleeding.
Take him to the nurse.

23:09.598 --> 23:11.063
Come with me.

23:11.063 --> 23:12.527
Huh? You want to keep
running your mouth?!

23:12.537 --> 23:14.815
-Bitch is popping off.
-About what?

23:14.815 --> 23:16.904
About everything.
Boy's just got a big mouth.

23:16.904 --> 23:18.828
Then I seen him rollin' up
on Evy.

23:18.818 --> 23:20.148
Evy dominguez?

23:20.158 --> 23:22.168
He's been on her since the cops
snatched her up out of class.

23:22.178 --> 23:24.623
He wants to talk some stuff,
I'm like, "cool, let's talk."

23:24.623 --> 23:26.535
You don't problem-solve
by beating on some kid.

23:26.545 --> 23:28.109
They're always saying smack.

23:28.109 --> 23:30.872
Talking in accents, calling us
spics, this and that.

23:30.882 --> 23:32.934
That's not what I saw.

23:32.934 --> 23:35.698
I saw you and two other boys
beating on one kid.

23:35.708 --> 23:37.271
Now, you have a problem
with a student,

23:37.271 --> 23:39.293
you have to take it
to a teacher, bring it to me --

23:39.293 --> 23:41.286
yeah. Right.

23:44.606 --> 23:48.905
Mateo, you do things
how you do things,

23:48.905 --> 23:50.791
I can't do anything
for you,

23:50.801 --> 23:53.575
so now you have
a three-day suspension.

23:57.706 --> 23:59.425
You have three days.

23:59.435 --> 24:02.170
Cool off.
Think about things.

24:05.014 --> 24:06.742
We're done.

24:10.649 --> 24:12.604
Mateo is a dumbass.

24:12.604 --> 24:14.166
He sees tre clowning me,

24:14.166 --> 24:16.510
and then him
and his boys jump him.

24:16.510 --> 24:17.488
Stupid.

24:17.488 --> 24:18.952
For real?

24:18.962 --> 24:21.727
Yeah, for real.

24:21.727 --> 24:23.904
Guys be tusslin' over me.

24:26.484 --> 24:28.340
Your mom working tonight?

24:28.349 --> 24:30.431
Yeah.

24:30.431 --> 24:32.969
I'm-a come by, okay?

24:32.969 --> 24:34.435
Yeah, I guess.

24:36.302 --> 24:37.766
O...Kay?

24:40.863 --> 24:43.471
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

24:43.471 --> 24:46.664
You need to act happy
or something.

24:56.051 --> 24:57.488
You glad
you're back here?

25:02.402 --> 25:05.302
<i> I'm glad you're back.</i>

25:20.786 --> 25:24.069
<i>[ Hip-hop music playing ]</i>

25:26.685 --> 25:27.663
Hey.

25:27.663 --> 25:29.059
What?

25:29.069 --> 25:30.700
What are you listening to?

25:30.700 --> 25:32.684
Music.

25:32.684 --> 25:33.651
Duh.

25:33.661 --> 25:37.764
Then don't act all stupid.

25:37.774 --> 25:40.048
There was a fight
at school today.

25:40.048 --> 25:42.911
This black dude got stomped over
some Mexican chick.

25:42.920 --> 25:46.799
It was cray.

25:46.799 --> 25:48.429
Are you even
listening to me?

25:48.429 --> 25:50.940
Leave me alone.

25:50.940 --> 25:53.352
Fine.

25:54.525 --> 25:56.674
Pschew!

25:56.674 --> 25:58.350
Dude.

25:58.350 --> 25:59.397
Give me the phone.

25:59.397 --> 26:00.249
Aw.

26:00.249 --> 26:01.522
Give me the phone.

26:01.522 --> 26:02.765
No.

26:02.765 --> 26:03.940
Give me the phone.

26:03.940 --> 26:05.409
Get off of me.

26:05.409 --> 26:06.681
Ohh.

26:06.681 --> 26:08.640
-Give me the phone.
-No!

26:10.540 --> 26:11.841
-Give me --
-stop!

26:11.841 --> 26:14.445
Give me the phone!

26:14.455 --> 26:16.814
Give it to me!
Give it to me right now!

26:16.805 --> 26:17.941
Stop!

26:19.614 --> 26:21.573
Stop!

26:21.573 --> 26:23.531
Stop.

26:33.145 --> 26:35.916
Why you been acting like
such a little bitch?

26:35.916 --> 26:37.933
Everything!

26:37.943 --> 26:38.883
Everything what?

26:38.893 --> 26:40.360
Everything sucks!

26:40.360 --> 26:43.141
Mom and dad suck.
School sucks.

26:43.141 --> 26:45.070
Two years,
you're gonna be gone.

26:45.070 --> 26:48.037
I'm gonna be stuck with them
and all their nonsense.

26:48.037 --> 26:49.467
You got basketball.
-You're so stupid.

26:49.476 --> 26:50.886
They send you
to the good school

26:50.876 --> 26:52.012
so you can go
to a good college,

26:52.022 --> 26:54.304
leave my ass
over at Marshall.

26:54.313 --> 26:55.850
Got the blacks
and the Mexicans

26:55.850 --> 26:57.514
trying to kill each other
all day.

27:00.745 --> 27:02.958
I got nothing here.

27:02.968 --> 27:07.775
Let me tell you --
soon as I'm 16, I'm out.

27:07.775 --> 27:09.997
I'm-a get a car --
don't care what kind.

27:09.987 --> 27:11.094
I am out.

27:11.104 --> 27:11.916
And go where?

27:11.916 --> 27:13.805
I don't know.

27:13.815 --> 27:17.184
Anyplace
is better than here.

27:18.877 --> 27:20.091
Probably Miami.

27:20.081 --> 27:26.387
It's got the best weather,
palms trees, beaches, clubs.

27:26.387 --> 27:32.105
Everybody hanging out
all the time, drinking.

27:32.105 --> 27:36.608
Ah, and the girls
are fine as hell.

27:36.618 --> 27:39.652
All 'em, like,
j.Lo-looking bitches

27:39.652 --> 27:44.519
and all talkin'
like Rihanna.

27:44.519 --> 27:47.485
You and me go down there,

27:47.495 --> 27:51.313
we'd be hittin' that
all the time.

27:55.729 --> 27:59.323
You should go...
Soon as you're 16.

27:59.323 --> 28:02.426
Man, we should both go.

28:02.426 --> 28:04.521
I can't.

30:15.283 --> 30:18.222
 I didn't understand
what all they did.

30:18.222 --> 30:20.991
Uh, I guess they said
they had to give him

30:21.001 --> 30:22.471
some charcoal
to pump out the drugs.

30:22.471 --> 30:24.300
How -- how -- how is he?

30:24.300 --> 30:25.348
Uh, he's okay.

30:25.348 --> 30:28.383
He's, uh, stable.

30:28.383 --> 30:29.853
If his brother hadn't been
there, then --

30:29.853 --> 30:32.750
yeah. What happened?

30:32.760 --> 30:36.910
Uh...
I had some ativan.

30:36.910 --> 30:38.350
My divorce has been
really rough.

30:38.350 --> 30:39.359
Hey, listen,
that's all right.

30:39.359 --> 30:40.759
You don't have to --
we all got stuff.

30:40.769 --> 30:42.141
I've been working longer hours
to make extra for the boys,

30:42.141 --> 30:44.225
and, you know,
it's just, uh...

30:45.762 --> 30:47.367
Eric is scared.

30:47.367 --> 30:48.445
Yeah.

30:48.445 --> 30:50.402
And there's nothing
I can do for him.

30:54.190 --> 30:57.266
Dan, did he do something
he's not telling me?

31:02.749 --> 31:05.981
Hey.

31:05.981 --> 31:07.280
Oh, no, no, no.

31:07.290 --> 31:08.407
Stay. It's all right.
Relax.

31:08.397 --> 31:10.551
I'm okay.

31:10.561 --> 31:13.303
Yeah.

31:13.303 --> 31:14.615
You good?

31:14.606 --> 31:15.448
Yeah.

31:15.457 --> 31:18.393
Yeah?
How you feeling?

31:22.976 --> 31:24.180
Look, uh...

31:26.989 --> 31:30.094
You know, I know that things
are really, um --

31:30.094 --> 31:31.925
really scary right now.

31:31.925 --> 31:34.343
They're scary
for all of us.

31:34.343 --> 31:36.370
And, uh, you know,
whatever it is,

31:36.370 --> 31:39.474
y-y-you know, you could have
talked to your dad.

31:39.474 --> 31:41.068
You could have come to me.

31:41.068 --> 31:42.773
Yeah, well,
you know you can talk to me.

31:42.773 --> 31:46.131
You suspended me, coach.
You did that for nothing.

31:46.131 --> 31:49.126
Now you want to act like we're
supposed to be best friends?

31:55.187 --> 32:02.471
That last game,
when I hit that buzzer beater...

32:02.471 --> 32:07.238
It felt so good,
everybody going crazy for me.

32:07.238 --> 32:10.048
For one moment,
everyone going crazy.

32:17.818 --> 32:19.687
I messed up.

32:25.821 --> 32:27.787
You messed up how?

32:27.787 --> 32:29.755
All I got is basketball.

32:29.755 --> 32:31.553
You know, that's paying
for school, for college.

32:31.562 --> 32:35.142
Was that semen
that they found yours?

32:36.812 --> 32:39.074
I can't lose this.

32:43.931 --> 32:45.799
Did you assault that boy?

32:49.928 --> 32:51.068
He wanted it.

32:51.077 --> 32:53.369
Oh, geez.
God, you sound like a rapist.

32:53.379 --> 32:56.073
I didn't rape him.

32:56.063 --> 32:58.746
He wanted it.
He wanted to hook up.

33:00.918 --> 33:04.291
Me and Taylor --
he planned it. He...

33:04.301 --> 33:05.549
We were supposed to meet up
that night.

33:05.549 --> 33:07.909
He was texting me,
e-mailing.

33:07.909 --> 33:10.111
Everything's on my phone.

33:10.102 --> 33:11.969
I-I wanted to give them
to the police.

33:11.979 --> 33:13.455
Well, why didn't you?

33:13.455 --> 33:15.124
You put everybody
through this?

33:15.124 --> 33:17.427
I mean, why --
why didn't you say something?

33:17.427 --> 33:18.872
Then everyone would know
I'm gay.

33:24.405 --> 33:26.107
Then what?

33:26.117 --> 33:28.674
Then I'm done
at basketball,

33:28.674 --> 33:30.149
I'm done at school,
I'm screwed,

33:30.149 --> 33:33.647
so...

33:33.657 --> 33:36.175
Some booze,
some pills...

33:38.583 --> 33:40.776
...I'm not your problem
anymore.

33:54.167 --> 33:55.966
Hey.

33:55.966 --> 33:58.324
Dan.
Hey, is -- is he okay?

33:58.324 --> 33:59.898
Did he --
did he say anything?

33:59.907 --> 34:01.511
You got to talk
to your boy.

34:18.734 --> 34:21.949
-Becca.
-Hey.

34:21.949 --> 34:24.112
I know that your mom and I
can be hard on you.

34:24.112 --> 34:26.147
-Yeah.
-Yeah, but, you know, that --

34:26.147 --> 34:27.721
that's only
because we love you.

34:27.721 --> 34:28.704
You know that, right?

34:28.704 --> 34:29.746
Okay.

34:29.755 --> 34:31.034
I mean, sometimes
we don't say it enough.

34:31.034 --> 34:32.056
Sometimes
we don't tell you --

34:32.045 --> 34:33.650
is this gonna be
one of those times

34:33.659 --> 34:35.822
where you tell me something
I did when I was 5?

34:39.036 --> 34:43.295
If you ever got a problem,
anything --

34:43.304 --> 34:45.800
are people saying stuff
about me at school?

34:45.800 --> 34:47.079
No,
th-this isn't about school.

34:47.079 --> 34:51.346
Just, if you have anything,
you can come to me, okay?

34:51.335 --> 34:53.431
Okay.

34:53.440 --> 34:54.914
You know that, right?

34:54.914 --> 34:55.828
Yeah. Okay.

35:03.282 --> 35:06.497
Okay, dad.

35:13.191 --> 35:14.961
 We know who it was
who had sex with your son.

35:14.961 --> 35:16.829
He admitted to it.

35:16.829 --> 35:18.638
He confessed?
Wh-who was it?

35:18.638 --> 35:20.536
Eric Tanner.

35:20.536 --> 35:22.699
Th-that's the one
that dropped Evy and Taylor off

35:22.699 --> 35:23.780
at the side of the road.

35:23.780 --> 35:25.480
Did you arrest him?

35:25.490 --> 35:27.889
Are you aware that Taylor
and this boy, Eric,

35:27.879 --> 35:30.730
knew each other before your son
claimed he was assaulted?

35:30.740 --> 35:32.707
They went
to the same school.

35:32.707 --> 35:35.626
Can you take a look
at these?

35:35.626 --> 35:37.003
What are they?

35:37.003 --> 35:39.962
Those are texts and e-mails
your son and Eric exchanged

35:39.952 --> 35:41.722
before the party.

35:44.446 --> 35:50.119
Um...These --
these aren't real.

35:50.129 --> 35:51.769
We've spoken
to Eric's parents.

35:51.769 --> 35:53.569
They've given us permission
to access

35:53.569 --> 35:58.002
their cellular and Internet
service providers.

35:58.002 --> 35:59.872
Okay. So?

35:59.872 --> 36:01.277
With that information,

36:01.277 --> 36:04.945
we'll be able to determine the
authenticity of these exchanges.

36:04.954 --> 36:06.172
I would really encourage you

36:06.163 --> 36:07.835
to have a conversation
with your son.

36:07.845 --> 36:11.439
If he's got something to say,
now's the time to say it.

36:21.637 --> 36:23.605
Feral mom cat figures out
how to adopt kittens?

36:23.605 --> 36:24.955
You have a lot
of adopted kittens.

36:24.955 --> 36:25.939
There's a lot of adoption.

36:25.939 --> 36:27.780
You pick.
-Okay.

36:27.780 --> 36:29.060
Oh, wow.

36:29.060 --> 36:30.072
It lost its power.

36:30.072 --> 36:31.146
Let's not.

36:31.156 --> 36:33.125
Let's -- let's --
let's give up on this.

36:34.022 --> 36:34.839
Mnh.

36:34.839 --> 36:35.794
-Hey, mom.
-Hey, Ms. Blaine.

36:35.794 --> 36:36.650
Where's your phone?

36:36.640 --> 36:37.950
-What?
-Go home. Go home.

36:37.960 --> 36:40.066
-She just got here.
-Where's your phone?

36:40.056 --> 36:42.519
What? What?
Hey.

36:42.529 --> 36:43.876
What's your password?
What's your password?

36:43.876 --> 36:44.959
-Why?
-Go home, Evy.

36:44.959 --> 36:46.208
-But sh-she just got here.
-Go home!

36:46.197 --> 36:47.311
-What -- what are you doing?
-What's your password?

36:47.321 --> 36:48.640
What's your password?
-What's going on?

36:48.630 --> 36:49.771
What are you doing?
Why are you acting like this?

36:49.781 --> 36:51.782
Did you go there
to have sex with him?

36:55.167 --> 36:56.999
Do you know about this?

36:57.008 --> 36:59.470
Have you been covering for him,
walking around,

36:59.470 --> 37:01.901
acting like a couple,
making me look like an idiot?

37:01.901 --> 37:04.067
I-I was defending you,
and --

37:04.077 --> 37:05.918
and you went there
to have sex with him.

37:05.908 --> 37:08.665
No.

37:08.675 --> 37:10.181
Mom.

37:10.181 --> 37:11.255
Mom?

37:11.265 --> 37:12.967
Mom.

37:15.045 --> 37:16.227
"R u gentle?"

37:16.227 --> 37:19.012
"Only d-done it once,
was gentle."

37:19.022 --> 37:21.020
"Top or bottom?
You decide."

37:21.020 --> 37:22.428
"When I whack off,

37:22.438 --> 37:25.853
p-pillow over my head
makes it better, hint, hint."

37:25.853 --> 37:28.452
Did you go there to have sex
with him?

37:34.162 --> 37:36.102
I didn't -- I didn't go there
to get attacked.

37:36.102 --> 37:37.676
I...

37:38.858 --> 37:41.625
No, no, Evy, um...

37:41.615 --> 37:43.681
Evy. Evy.

37:43.690 --> 37:44.844
Evy!

37:48.782 --> 37:52.395
I don't...
I don't get it.

37:52.395 --> 37:53.546
What did you do?

37:53.546 --> 37:54.757
I went to the school.

37:54.757 --> 37:56.332
-What did you do?
-I went to the police.

37:56.332 --> 37:57.542
Why are you doing this?

37:57.552 --> 37:59.523
I-I-I kept telling you
to leave it alone!

37:59.523 --> 38:00.900
Why are you doing this?!

38:05.173 --> 38:08.687
Why didn't...
You tell me the truth?

38:13.384 --> 38:16.209
What, did you think
that I wouldn't --

38:16.209 --> 38:18.246
did you think
that I would feel different?

38:18.246 --> 38:19.555
Did you think
that I wouldn't love you

38:19.555 --> 38:22.735
because of the way
you felt?

38:22.745 --> 38:26.131
Do you think that --

38:26.131 --> 38:28.426
do you really think
that I can't love you?

38:34.274 --> 38:36.213
You left me.

38:36.213 --> 38:39.136
You...

38:39.136 --> 38:41.173
Well...

38:41.173 --> 38:43.606
I was, um...

38:43.606 --> 38:45.900
I wasn't good.
I needed help.

38:59.043 --> 39:02.192
I...I know.

39:02.192 --> 39:06.190
I left you
with Nate and Patty

39:06.200 --> 39:07.607
because I didn't want
to lose you.

39:07.616 --> 39:09.723
I know. I know.

39:09.714 --> 39:12.234
I know
how hard it was for you.

39:16.153 --> 39:18.672
I didn't want
to do that again.

39:32.220 --> 39:34.522
The e-mails
and the text messages help.

39:34.522 --> 39:35.704
They obviously indicate
that the intent

39:35.704 --> 39:37.998
was for a consensual act.

39:37.998 --> 39:41.050
But, if at any time the victim
withdrew consent, it is rape.

39:41.050 --> 39:42.161
They prove that how?

39:42.171 --> 39:43.491
There was a party
full of people.

39:43.481 --> 39:44.692
If anybody heard anything --

39:44.702 --> 39:46.021
Nobody said they did.

39:46.011 --> 39:47.124
No, no one has said
that under oath.

39:47.134 --> 39:48.442
Then why do we even care?

39:48.442 --> 39:50.540
Our school is getting trashed
in every news outlet,

39:50.549 --> 39:52.194
every landing page
in Indiana.

39:52.194 --> 39:54.527
 It was a couple of gay
boys off at a basketball party.

39:54.527 --> 39:56.723
Those e-mails --
that's just deviant.

39:56.723 --> 39:58.465
This is more
than just an embarrassment.

39:58.465 --> 40:00.473
This party was not sanctioned
by the school,

40:00.463 --> 40:02.235
but it was advertised
at the school.

40:02.245 --> 40:03.949
There was also apparently
a tradition

40:03.949 --> 40:05.189
called "making the team."

40:05.199 --> 40:08.220
Girls were expected to have sex
with the players.

40:08.220 --> 40:10.919
Over the years, this party has
become somewhat of an orgy,

40:10.919 --> 40:13.802
and if the school was aware that
this was an unsafe environment

40:13.802 --> 40:16.363
and did nothing about it,
that is a problem.

40:16.363 --> 40:20.919
Right now, "he said/he said,"
for lack of a better phrase --

40:20.929 --> 40:22.731
that's the situation.

40:22.741 --> 40:24.387
Without supporting statements

40:24.387 --> 40:26.777
that it was anything
other than a consensual act,

40:26.777 --> 40:28.677
the case can't move forward.

40:28.686 --> 40:30.952
We have to make certain
no supporting statements exist.

40:30.952 --> 40:32.794
Do we want to reach out
to these families?

40:32.794 --> 40:34.565
Send an e-mail
about our perspective --

40:34.565 --> 40:36.632
no. We don't want
to e-mail people.

40:36.632 --> 40:38.040
We don't want to e-mail them.

40:38.051 --> 40:40.736
As your legal counsel, I don't
think you want to do anything.

40:40.736 --> 40:42.312
You -- you start directing
traffic,

40:42.312 --> 40:43.849
you open yourselves up
to collusion.

40:43.859 --> 40:47.205
And so we should just hope
that people believe

40:47.215 --> 40:49.056
the for-profit,
private institution

40:49.046 --> 40:52.167
didn't conspire against
the young man on financial aid

40:52.167 --> 40:53.770
who was constantly bullied

40:53.781 --> 40:56.242
even before people found out
he was apparently gay?

40:56.242 --> 40:59.521
It's just --
it's naive to think this school

40:59.530 --> 41:01.402
is going to get
an objective hearing.

41:01.402 --> 41:03.174
This is the tipping point.

41:03.174 --> 41:04.976
We can hope things fall
the school's way,

41:04.986 --> 41:06.954
or we can make certain they do.

41:06.954 --> 41:11.944
We have 520 children
at this school -- 520.

41:11.944 --> 41:14.740
They deserve better
than the lies, the innuendo.

41:14.740 --> 41:16.807
We have a young man
in the hospital

41:16.807 --> 41:18.452
who tried to take his own life

41:18.452 --> 41:20.983
because this other young man
refused to admit

41:20.983 --> 41:22.360
what he was involved in.

41:22.360 --> 41:23.868
If you read these e-mails,

41:23.868 --> 41:26.682
they are a blueprint
for a rough encounter.

41:26.692 --> 41:28.761
That's the truth.

41:30.443 --> 41:33.426
That's the truth
people need to believe.
