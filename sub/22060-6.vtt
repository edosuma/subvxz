WEBVTT

00:05.206 --> 00:07.073
You want me out?

00:07.675 --> 00:09.876
You want me out?

00:11.712 --> 00:14.047
This is what happens.

00:14.049 --> 00:17.350
I'm not going anywhere.
You hear me?!

00:17.352 --> 00:19.285
Here!
Whoa!

00:20.255 --> 00:22.755
That is what eviction
looks like!

00:26.494 --> 00:28.561
Hey! All right, get back.

00:28.563 --> 00:30.296
Get all these people back.
All right.

00:30.298 --> 00:31.831
Hey.
Step back, step back.

00:31.833 --> 00:33.433
Back up. Whoa, back up, back up.

00:33.435 --> 00:35.969
Hey, folks,
let's get back.

00:35.971 --> 00:37.170
Move up.

00:37.172 --> 00:38.471
Hey, police. Open up!

00:38.473 --> 00:40.707
Leave me alone!

00:42.510 --> 00:44.444
Hey. Stop.

00:44.446 --> 00:45.545
Hey, put that down.

00:45.547 --> 00:46.813
Hey, police!
Put those down.

00:46.815 --> 00:48.114
Put it down.

00:51.019 --> 00:54.954
This is my home since 1979.

00:54.956 --> 00:57.824
I shouldn't have to leave.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.196
On to the Belvin case.

01:03.198 --> 01:06.866
The defense has filed
for a motion.

01:06.868 --> 01:08.268
Are you gonna eat that

01:08.270 --> 01:10.069
or are you just gonna move it
around on your plate?

01:10.071 --> 01:12.272
I'm still trying to find
the other four eggs

01:12.274 --> 01:14.173
and the pound of bacon
I normally have.

01:14.175 --> 01:15.508
You said you wanted
to lose weight.

01:15.510 --> 01:16.876
Do I have to lose my mind, too?

01:16.878 --> 01:19.579
Anyway, back to Belvin.

01:19.581 --> 01:21.948
I need you to verify

01:21.950 --> 01:23.917
where he was from the moment
he left his house

01:23.919 --> 01:26.185
to the exact time
of the crash.

01:26.187 --> 01:27.487
Excuse me, Ms. Reagan?

01:27.489 --> 01:28.655
Yes?

01:28.657 --> 01:29.856
I'm Bev Gower.

01:29.858 --> 01:31.624
Um...

01:32.293 --> 01:34.260
You don't remember me?

01:34.262 --> 01:36.462
Uh, no, but you look familiar,
I just...

01:36.464 --> 01:39.332
I'm the wife of the man
you killed.

01:39.334 --> 01:40.466
He's dead!

01:40.468 --> 01:43.503
My husband is dead
because of you!

01:43.505 --> 01:44.470
He's dead!

01:44.472 --> 01:46.573
Calm down. Calm down.
You hear me?!

01:46.575 --> 01:48.308
Let go of me!

01:51.445 --> 01:53.446
Sean, come on.
You're gonna be late.

01:53.448 --> 01:55.882
Hey, how about we
have a contest today?

01:55.884 --> 01:58.785
Whoever has the better day gets
to choose the takeout tonight.

01:58.787 --> 02:00.086
Yeah. Okay.

02:00.088 --> 02:02.255
Something wrong?

02:02.257 --> 02:03.957
Not really.

02:07.161 --> 02:09.963
Dad, why did she die
and not you?

02:13.634 --> 02:16.903
I don't mean that, uh...

02:16.905 --> 02:18.705
You and Uncle Jamie
have the dangerous jobs.

02:18.707 --> 02:20.740
But nobody ever warned
you that your mom

02:20.742 --> 02:23.209
might not make it home
from work one day.

02:23.211 --> 02:24.811
Yeah.

02:24.813 --> 02:28.848
Look, if I could...

02:28.850 --> 02:31.517
change it and bring
your mom back,

02:31.519 --> 02:33.820
you know I would...

02:33.822 --> 02:35.021
but I can't.

02:35.023 --> 02:38.758
So you're stuck
with me, kiddo.

02:38.760 --> 02:40.293
'Cause I'm not going anywhere.

02:40.295 --> 02:42.061
Okay?

02:42.063 --> 02:43.663
Come on. Get out of here.

02:43.665 --> 02:44.797
Gonna be late.

02:44.799 --> 02:47.800
Have a good day, okay?

03:01.016 --> 03:03.583
Sir, Archbishop Kearns
is on his way up.

03:03.585 --> 03:05.318
He's not on the schedule.

03:05.320 --> 03:06.753
No. He said he was
in the neighborhood.

03:06.755 --> 03:09.389
Once an altar boy...

03:11.091 --> 03:12.225
Welcome, Your Eminence.

03:12.227 --> 03:13.626
Thank you, my dear,
for showing me up.

03:13.628 --> 03:15.395
Your Eminence.
Hello, Frank.

03:15.397 --> 03:17.230
My apologies for the imposition.

03:17.232 --> 03:18.731
Thank you, Baker.

03:18.733 --> 03:21.434
Please, sit down.

03:21.436 --> 03:25.705
Frank, um... I, um,

03:25.707 --> 03:29.142
I have a moral quandary
that I need your help with.

03:29.144 --> 03:30.943
I'm honored.

03:30.945 --> 03:33.813
Wary but honored.

03:33.815 --> 03:35.615
If you had a ring,
I would kiss it.

03:35.617 --> 03:38.685
Come on, Kevin. Let's have it.

03:40.521 --> 03:42.755
A woman was arrested
this morning in SoHo

03:42.757 --> 03:46.125
for noncompliance
with a eviction notice.

03:46.127 --> 03:47.226
She's a painter.

03:47.228 --> 03:48.795
She founded the
neighborhood garden.

03:48.797 --> 03:50.730
She fought against
gentrification.

03:50.732 --> 03:54.100
She-she pretty much fits
the urban saint profile.

03:54.102 --> 03:55.101
She have a name?

03:55.103 --> 03:56.969
Uh, I'm not good
with names.

03:56.971 --> 03:58.638
No matter. I can get
the arrest report.

03:58.640 --> 04:02.508
The Diocese owns the building
she's lived in for decades

04:02.510 --> 04:04.310
and recently sold
it to a developer.

04:04.312 --> 04:06.979
I-I can't stop the sale,

04:06.981 --> 04:09.982
but I managed to barter a
week's extension for her.

04:09.984 --> 04:14.887
But an arrest, it seems like
adding insult to injury.

04:14.889 --> 04:19.125
I don't void arrests.

04:19.127 --> 04:23.429
No, I know, but you, you do have
allies in the D.A.'s office

04:23.431 --> 04:26.132
who might be able to help
determine the charges.

04:26.134 --> 04:30.369
One lovely young lady in
particular, I believe.

04:32.339 --> 04:35.975
I'll relay the compliment,
if not the request.

04:35.977 --> 04:40.246
Frank, this is gonna play out
in the press and in the parishes

04:40.248 --> 04:43.516
as a city treasure who was
thrown out on the streets

04:43.518 --> 04:47.453
for the wages of greed-- greed
on the part of the archdiocese--

04:47.455 --> 04:50.389
and that's a buck
that stops with me.

04:52.192 --> 04:54.260
What's happened to you, Kevin?

04:54.262 --> 04:56.329
Since when do you put
the needs of an individual

04:56.331 --> 04:57.997
before the needs of the Church?

04:57.999 --> 05:02.335
Now that I'm rounding third
base and heading for home,

05:02.337 --> 05:04.337
I-I'd like to spend
the rest of my days

05:04.339 --> 05:07.406
sharing the love of God
with individuals in need,

05:07.408 --> 05:10.109
rather than the entire flock.

05:10.111 --> 05:12.111
Does that make any sense?

05:12.980 --> 05:15.148
It does.

05:16.383 --> 05:19.152
But I need your help, Frank.

05:19.154 --> 05:21.154
This lady needs your help.

05:23.023 --> 05:25.424
I'll see what I can do.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.926
Thank you.

05:26.928 --> 05:28.828
I won't take any more
of your time.

05:28.830 --> 05:30.163
God bless you, my friend.

05:33.167 --> 05:35.034
I look forward
to hearing from you.

05:39.307 --> 05:42.375
Hey, surprised I beat you here.

05:42.377 --> 05:43.609
Traffic on the Verrazano.

05:43.611 --> 05:45.444
Yeah, but I was coming
from Uptown,

05:45.446 --> 05:47.880
where a certain
vice detective lives.

05:47.882 --> 05:49.615
Sounds fun.

05:49.617 --> 05:50.850
Wow, seriously?

05:50.852 --> 05:52.485
You don't want to know
all the juicy details?

05:52.487 --> 05:54.854
Uh, I'm glad you had
a good time.

05:54.856 --> 05:56.022
Okay?

05:56.024 --> 05:57.223
Okay.

05:57.225 --> 05:58.991
What's going on with you?

05:58.993 --> 06:00.459
Nothing's
going on with me.

06:00.461 --> 06:01.794
Reagan, I know you.

06:01.796 --> 06:04.030
I know when something's
eating at you.

06:04.032 --> 06:07.834
If you know me, then you'd know
that there's nothing wrong

06:07.836 --> 06:09.502
when I say there's
nothing wrong.

06:11.305 --> 06:12.839
What do we got, Cosgrove?

06:12.841 --> 06:14.040
One male, DOA.

06:14.042 --> 06:15.808
So we don't even know
if it's a homicide?

06:15.810 --> 06:16.943
Not until you work
your magic.

06:16.945 --> 06:19.579
It's not magic; it's skill.

06:20.814 --> 06:23.716
Is that the basketball player,
Roland Jeffries?

06:23.718 --> 06:26.853
Looks like he had
a fun night, too...

06:26.855 --> 06:29.021
till he didn't.

06:32.626 --> 06:36.626

Got to be about a dozen

07:02.104 --> 07:04.638
Yeah, the media is gonna have
a field day with this one.

07:04.640 --> 07:07.274
Got cocaine residue
on his nose,

07:07.276 --> 07:09.143
couple empties
in his pockets,

07:09.145 --> 07:10.811
a few under the sofa.

07:10.813 --> 07:12.346
And only two years
in the NBA.

07:12.348 --> 07:13.480
Well, you know
what they say.

07:13.482 --> 07:15.482
Live fast, die young.

07:15.484 --> 07:16.984
Sir, you
need to back up now.

07:16.986 --> 07:18.185
Would you let me
in there, please?

07:18.187 --> 07:19.219
That is my client.

07:19.221 --> 07:20.287
Do you want him

07:20.289 --> 07:21.722
or the room service girl
who found the stiff?

07:21.724 --> 07:22.990
Uh, I'm not gonna deal
with that prick.

07:22.992 --> 07:25.626
You can.
I'll talk to the girl.

07:25.628 --> 07:27.828
Can I talk to your supervisor?
It's okay, Cosgrove.

07:28.930 --> 07:30.531
I'm Detective Baez.

07:30.533 --> 07:31.932
You're Mr. Jeffries' agent?
JJ Baruch.

07:31.934 --> 07:33.734
I can't believe this.

07:33.736 --> 07:34.935
I'm sorry for your loss.

07:34.937 --> 07:38.072
He ordered food and I brought it
up around 2:00 a.m.

07:38.074 --> 07:40.207
There were three guys
here with him.

07:40.209 --> 07:43.043
One of them laughed and asked
if I was dessert, so...

07:43.045 --> 07:45.312
I just set up the cart
and left as fast as I could.

07:45.314 --> 07:46.647
You get that a lot?

07:46.649 --> 07:50.351
Guests flirting with you
and being inappropriate?

07:50.353 --> 07:51.885
Men and women.

07:51.887 --> 07:53.253
When people check
into a hotel,

07:53.255 --> 07:54.621
they kind of
lose their minds.

07:54.623 --> 07:56.724
What time did you
find the body?

07:56.726 --> 07:58.258
About 7:00 a.m.

07:58.260 --> 08:01.028
I-I came back for the cart,

08:01.030 --> 08:05.032
but he was just lying there.

08:05.034 --> 08:08.369
It's so weird 'cause I saw him
in the lobby yesterday,

08:08.371 --> 08:11.171
and he was laughing
and seemed so happy.

08:11.173 --> 08:13.307
Was he with his three friends
from the room

08:13.309 --> 08:15.008
when you saw him in the lobby?

08:15.010 --> 08:16.543
No, just fans
taking selfies with him.

08:16.545 --> 08:18.245
Did you take a selfie with him?

08:18.247 --> 08:20.447
No. I'm more into football.

08:20.449 --> 08:22.750
Me, too.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.085
All right.

08:30.992 --> 08:32.458
I placed her
in the conference room

08:32.461 --> 08:35.328
like you asked, though I would
have taken great pleasure

08:35.331 --> 08:37.030
in throwing her ass in a cell.

08:37.032 --> 08:39.299
Well, thank you
for your restraint.

08:39.301 --> 08:41.068
- Is that the case she was yelling about?
- Yeah.

08:41.070 --> 08:43.703
Nine years ago,
her husband, Norm Gower,

08:43.706 --> 08:47.007
was a pro Bono lawyer
with a client named Tina Araya.

08:47.009 --> 08:50.644
She was a heroin addict who was
arrested for stealing a car.

08:50.646 --> 08:53.347
Gower got obsessed with her,
went to her place one night,

08:53.349 --> 08:54.481
attacked her.

08:54.483 --> 08:56.417
Her screams alerted
the neighbors.

08:56.419 --> 08:58.118
He fled.

08:58.120 --> 09:01.288
Trial took one day.
Jury took one hour.

09:01.290 --> 09:02.489
Open and shut.

09:02.491 --> 09:05.592
Didn't hurt that Norm
acted as his own attorney

09:05.594 --> 09:07.327
and was in way over his head.

09:07.329 --> 09:09.263
Or that you're
a kickass prosecutor.

09:09.265 --> 09:10.464
Well...

09:10.466 --> 09:12.866
You know, New York hasn't

09:12.868 --> 09:15.335
executed anyone in 50 years.

09:15.337 --> 09:18.539
So, how's the wife saying
that you killed her husband?

09:20.375 --> 09:22.342
I don't know.

09:22.344 --> 09:24.511
Let's go ask her.

09:24.513 --> 09:26.680
Last and certainly least,

09:26.682 --> 09:28.081
the mayor has ordered
new portraits

09:28.083 --> 09:29.917
for all city commissioners.
No.

09:29.919 --> 09:32.753
It's a thing for the corridor
outside her office in City Hall.

09:32.755 --> 09:33.854
So she feels like...

09:33.856 --> 09:35.456
Like she was actually elected,

09:35.458 --> 09:37.391
like she actually
picked us?

09:37.393 --> 09:38.826
I don't know.
Just say yes.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.994
Who's painting these portraits?
Her niece? Her nephew?

09:40.996 --> 09:42.062
I'm not sure.

09:42.064 --> 09:43.964
Still, no.

09:43.966 --> 09:45.098
What do you got, Sid?

09:45.100 --> 09:47.267
That the archbishop
left a couple of things

09:47.269 --> 09:49.670
out of his account of
Ms. Slaughter's arrest.

09:49.672 --> 09:50.771
Her name's Slaughter?

09:50.773 --> 09:52.306
Trudy Slaughter, yeah.

09:54.542 --> 09:56.376
The artist?

09:56.378 --> 09:58.078
Yeah. You know her?

09:58.080 --> 10:00.147
I know who she is.

10:00.149 --> 10:01.482
Call came in because
she was tossing

10:01.484 --> 10:04.418
objects out
of a third story window

10:04.420 --> 10:05.652
and endangering passerbys,

10:05.654 --> 10:06.920
some of which were
cans of paint,

10:06.922 --> 10:09.590
some of which
narrowly missed

10:09.592 --> 10:12.993
Officers Reagan and Janko,
but repainted their radio car.

10:12.995 --> 10:15.229
It get worse?

10:15.231 --> 10:16.663
Officer Reagan
was able to arrest her

10:16.665 --> 10:19.533
without further incident
or resistance.

10:23.071 --> 10:25.272
Okay.

10:28.576 --> 10:30.244
I didn't mean to hurt you.

10:30.246 --> 10:32.579
Flipping over a table ain't
exactly a way to say hello.

10:32.581 --> 10:34.815
I'm just still so angry.

10:34.817 --> 10:36.650
I thought I wouldn't be
after all this time,

10:36.652 --> 10:40.053
but... but then
Norm was released from prison

10:40.055 --> 10:41.922
last month and the look
in his eyes...

10:41.924 --> 10:43.957
I'm sorry, what?
He's not dead?

10:43.959 --> 10:45.559
Not physically.

10:46.461 --> 10:48.495
But inside, he is.

10:49.964 --> 10:53.467
That's what happens when you
send an innocent man to prison.

10:53.469 --> 10:56.203
The jury sent him after
hearing all the evidence.

10:56.205 --> 10:58.005
He's innocent!

10:58.007 --> 10:59.039
Oh.

10:59.041 --> 11:02.776
I swear on my life
Norm is the sweetest,

11:02.778 --> 11:05.345
kindest soul I've ever known--
he wouldn't attack anyone.

11:05.347 --> 11:07.414
The victim,
Tina Araya,

11:07.416 --> 11:08.682
ID'd him in court.

11:08.684 --> 11:10.450
Norm spent his whole life
helping clients.

11:10.452 --> 11:12.853
His fingerprints were
all over her apartment.

11:12.855 --> 11:14.354
Because he rented it for her

11:14.356 --> 11:16.423
so she could turn
her life around.

11:16.425 --> 11:19.126
I know he screwed up
representing himself in court,

11:19.128 --> 11:21.695
but he thought no one
could possibly believe

11:21.697 --> 11:23.530
he'd harm Tina.

11:23.532 --> 11:26.800
And then you
told the jury

11:26.802 --> 11:29.503
he was an evil man
masquerading as a saint.

11:29.505 --> 11:31.538
And I watched as each
and every one of them

11:31.540 --> 11:33.674
started to believe you.
Mrs. Gower...

11:33.676 --> 11:36.510
Even Norm said it was
a great closing argument.

11:38.546 --> 11:40.547
Then the jury found him guilty,

11:40.549 --> 11:43.684
and he was taken away.

11:43.686 --> 11:49.056
And that's the last time
I saw my husband really alive.

11:49.058 --> 11:50.157
March 24,

11:50.159 --> 11:53.961
2008.

11:55.763 --> 11:58.432
Uh...

11:58.434 --> 12:01.335
Detective ABETEMARCO
will see you out.

12:01.337 --> 12:03.303
Meet Roland Jeffries' three
friends from last night--

12:03.305 --> 12:05.038
the North Side Sinners.

12:05.040 --> 12:07.474
Boy band?
Yeah, I wish.

12:07.476 --> 12:08.475
Try drug gang.

12:08.477 --> 12:09.910
Narcotics says
they're new in town,

12:09.912 --> 12:12.279
but they are from the same
neighborhood in Philly

12:12.281 --> 12:14.147
where Roland Jeffries
is from.

12:14.149 --> 12:15.582
Well, that explains why
they were hanging out,

12:15.584 --> 12:17.284
but not what
happened to Roland.

12:17.286 --> 12:19.519
Well, apparently their boss--
the guy pictured

12:19.521 --> 12:21.888
in the mug shot there,
Santiago Cabbad--

12:21.890 --> 12:23.023
is very paranoid.

12:23.025 --> 12:24.691
So much so that last year,
when he thought

12:24.693 --> 12:26.126
one of his underlings
was talking to the cops,

12:26.128 --> 12:28.996
he made the kid eat so much coke
that his stomach exploded

12:28.998 --> 12:31.498
and he OD'd choking
on his own vomit.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.933
Seems like a waste of product.

12:32.935 --> 12:34.935
Yeah, but it's a good way
to keep your crew in line.

12:34.937 --> 12:38.238
You think Roland somehow
pissed off his old pal

12:38.240 --> 12:39.339
and got the same treatment?

12:39.341 --> 12:41.475
There's only one person to ask.

12:42.710 --> 12:44.144
You got it.

12:46.981 --> 12:48.715
I get to see my daughter
on a school night,

12:48.717 --> 12:50.250
<i>and</i> she brings me dinner?

12:50.252 --> 12:52.853
Okay, so what do you need?

12:52.855 --> 12:54.821
What do you mean?
There is no such thing

12:54.823 --> 12:57.724
as a free lunch or dinner.

12:57.726 --> 12:59.593
Maybe you spend too much time
around criminals

12:59.595 --> 13:00.794
and their lawyers.

13:00.796 --> 13:02.129
Maybe.

13:04.832 --> 13:07.734
There is something
I need from you.

13:07.736 --> 13:09.102
Shoot.

13:09.104 --> 13:13.306
What was it like when
your dad and I split up?

13:14.942 --> 13:17.778
Well, I mean, I was
still pretty little.

13:17.780 --> 13:20.847
Yeah, I know, but...
how do you remember me?

13:20.849 --> 13:25.652
Kind of... unpredictable.

13:26.921 --> 13:27.954
What do you mean?

13:27.956 --> 13:29.389
One minute you'd be

13:29.391 --> 13:31.324
running around, all smiles,

13:31.326 --> 13:33.493
going, "Everything is
gonna be great,"

13:33.495 --> 13:35.295
and then, the next minute

13:35.297 --> 13:38.799
you'd be in your room
crying... loud.

13:39.867 --> 13:41.068
What else?

13:41.070 --> 13:42.135
Oh, and this kid

13:42.137 --> 13:45.238
in soccer I had a crush on--
Jeff Butler--

13:45.240 --> 13:47.641
you said not to even bother,

13:47.643 --> 13:49.976
that "no man can be trusted,

13:49.978 --> 13:53.313
especially the ones
that seem the nicest."

13:53.315 --> 13:54.715
Sorry about that.

13:56.618 --> 13:58.218
Look, what's this all about?

13:59.621 --> 14:02.322
I put a man away nine years ago

14:02.324 --> 14:05.492
on the same day
your dad and I got a divorce.

14:05.494 --> 14:08.528
March 24, 2008.

14:08.530 --> 14:12.065
The man's wife has always
maintained his innocence.

14:12.067 --> 14:13.600
Blindly, I always thought.

14:13.602 --> 14:16.436
But maybe you were
the blind one,

14:16.438 --> 14:18.338
given all that was going on.

14:20.241 --> 14:22.442
I hope not.

14:22.444 --> 14:25.112
But that's what keeps
kicking around in my head.

14:28.149 --> 14:29.149
What do we got, boss?

14:29.151 --> 14:30.717
Cabbad and a dozen
of his boys

14:30.719 --> 14:32.319
just went in about
a half hour ago.

14:32.321 --> 14:34.054
You run a camera under the door,
see who's where?

14:34.056 --> 14:35.122
Was I supposed to?

14:35.124 --> 14:36.523
Well, it'd be nice
for me and my partner

14:36.525 --> 14:38.792
not to get our heads
blown off when we walk in.

14:39.727 --> 14:41.762
All right, whatever.
Let's go, we'll follow.

14:41.764 --> 14:43.396
Let's move.

14:50.338 --> 14:51.938
Go! Go! Go!

14:51.940 --> 14:53.673
Police!
Everybody down!

14:53.675 --> 14:54.543
Are we gonna go?

14:54.567 --> 14:56.544
No, we're gonna wait till
they clear the building,

14:56.545 --> 14:58.278
and then we'll go-- protocol.

14:58.280 --> 15:00.280
Since when do you care
about protocol?

15:00.282 --> 15:02.816
Clear!
Since now.

15:15.191 --> 15:16.624
Kill Roland?

15:16.626 --> 15:18.793
Nah, man, he's my boy
from way back.

15:18.795 --> 15:21.596
Yeah, such an inspirational
story, the two of you.

15:21.598 --> 15:23.164
Both coming up out
of the mean streets

15:23.166 --> 15:24.499
of Philly.

15:24.501 --> 15:25.667
He makes it to the big leagues,

15:25.669 --> 15:27.502
and you make it
to the Big Apple.

15:27.504 --> 15:29.904
Except he plays ball
and you sling dope.

15:29.906 --> 15:31.105
Big difference.

15:31.107 --> 15:33.007
We all got talents.

15:33.009 --> 15:34.709
What went wrong
the other night?

15:34.711 --> 15:37.078
Nothing. We hung out
in the bar for a while.

15:37.080 --> 15:39.180
Played some Xbox in his room,

15:39.182 --> 15:40.715
then me and my crew split.

15:40.717 --> 15:42.116
Is it just me, or is he omitting

15:42.118 --> 15:43.885
a very important part
of the timeline?

15:43.887 --> 15:45.954
The part where they did
a boatload of coke.

15:45.956 --> 15:46.921
Yeah, that part.

15:46.923 --> 15:48.356
Hey, only Ro was getting high.

15:48.358 --> 15:50.058
And I'm a Jamaican jet pilot.

15:50.060 --> 15:51.759
Fine, we might have done some,

15:51.761 --> 15:53.127
but he Hoovered up most of it.

15:53.129 --> 15:54.596
Ro never could
shake his thirst.

15:54.598 --> 15:56.331
Uh-huh.
Must have OD'd.

15:56.333 --> 15:59.100
Right. Except we have
a different theory.

15:59.102 --> 16:01.903
Which is that he didn't want
to pay for the hookup--

16:01.905 --> 16:03.671
that he thought you and your
buddies should be thankful

16:03.673 --> 16:05.206
you were even allowed
to hang out in a suite

16:05.208 --> 16:06.941
with a superstar
like him.

16:06.943 --> 16:08.009
'Cause when
one of your homies

16:08.011 --> 16:10.178
gets too big
for his britches, Cabbad,

16:10.180 --> 16:11.613
you cut him down to size.

16:11.615 --> 16:13.915
Yeah, sure do, don't you?

16:15.451 --> 16:17.485
I don't know, maybe you, uh...

16:17.487 --> 16:20.021
What's that?

16:20.023 --> 16:21.356
Speak up,
I can't hear you.

16:21.358 --> 16:24.259
I said you got your head
up your ass, man!

16:28.030 --> 16:29.330
You son of a bitch.
Hey!

16:29.332 --> 16:31.032
- How about I kick your ass for you, man?
- Hey, hey!

16:31.034 --> 16:32.300
Get off me.

16:32.302 --> 16:34.302
I didn't kill my friend!

16:34.304 --> 16:35.403
Keep smiling.

16:35.405 --> 16:37.315
I'm gonna wipe that smile
off your face, you punk.

16:37.316 --> 16:38.740
What the hell is
wrong with you?

16:38.742 --> 16:40.541
What happened to protocol?

16:40.543 --> 16:42.043
Come-- look at him.
No.

16:42.045 --> 16:43.084
Get out of here before
you ruin this damn case.

16:43.108 --> 16:44.179
No, we're gonna...

16:44.180 --> 16:45.847
Go.

16:53.290 --> 16:55.857
Officer, this has been resolved.

16:55.859 --> 16:57.926
I have another week.

17:04.098 --> 17:06.267
Frank Reagan, Ms. Slaughter.

17:06.269 --> 17:09.304
I know who you are.

17:10.839 --> 17:12.607
May I come in?

17:14.944 --> 17:16.277
Uh, sure.

17:22.984 --> 17:26.788
Is it true the archdiocese
offered you

17:26.790 --> 17:28.690
a million dollars
for this place?

17:28.692 --> 17:30.725
Is that what this is?

17:30.727 --> 17:32.327
What what is?

17:32.329 --> 17:34.062
Well, first I get
strong-armed by the Church,

17:34.064 --> 17:35.463
and now by the State?

17:35.465 --> 17:37.665
No.
It sure feels that way.

17:37.667 --> 17:40.068
Not my intention.

17:42.604 --> 17:44.806
Why don't you just
take the money?

17:47.376 --> 17:50.878
This has been my home
and my studio since 1979.

17:50.880 --> 17:54.048
I can't replace it
at five times that amount.

17:54.050 --> 17:56.617
And even if you could...

17:56.619 --> 17:59.220
it wouldn't be the same.

17:59.222 --> 18:01.923
What are you doing here,
Mr. Reagan?

18:03.092 --> 18:05.893
The archbishop asked
if I would try

18:05.895 --> 18:08.396
to find a way to help you out
of the jam

18:08.398 --> 18:09.731
you got yourself into.

18:09.733 --> 18:11.099
Why?

18:11.101 --> 18:12.567
He feels guilty.

18:12.569 --> 18:14.435
And, to be honest, he knows

18:14.437 --> 18:17.071
he's in for some bad press
if you get into the system

18:17.073 --> 18:20.341
and your story gets picked up.

18:20.343 --> 18:22.276
Unless that's what
you're looking for,

18:22.278 --> 18:24.545
to make another scene.

18:24.547 --> 18:25.713
Sorry about that.

18:25.715 --> 18:27.648
I kind of lost it.

18:27.650 --> 18:31.753
Your sentence could be
community service.

18:34.456 --> 18:37.325
Namely, to paint my portrait.

18:37.327 --> 18:40.762
Comes with
a thousand-dollar stipend.

18:42.965 --> 18:45.033
Uh, you see that little piece?

18:45.035 --> 18:47.235
That's $3,000.

18:47.237 --> 18:50.805
You'd make mine wallet-size.

18:54.843 --> 18:57.378
You can paint a portrait, right?

18:57.380 --> 18:59.814
What is that supposed to mean?
Don't get me wrong.

18:59.816 --> 19:02.917
Your work is beautiful.

19:02.919 --> 19:06.654
But there's no people in it.

19:06.656 --> 19:10.358
Yes, I can paint a portrait.

19:10.360 --> 19:13.394
I always loved that one.

19:15.464 --> 19:17.231
You've seen it before?

19:17.233 --> 19:21.669
No, I meant Zito's Bakery.

19:21.671 --> 19:24.038
Bleecker and Cornelia.

19:24.040 --> 19:27.275
I can still smell the bread.
Miss that.

19:31.613 --> 19:34.749
Do we have a deal?

19:34.751 --> 19:37.452
Gets me off the hook?

19:37.454 --> 19:39.520
I'm afraid I can't change
the fact that

19:39.522 --> 19:41.622
you're gonna have to move.

19:41.624 --> 19:45.326
My office will be in touch.
Thank you.

19:52.468 --> 19:53.901
Hello, sis.

19:53.903 --> 19:55.970
Ah, Danny.
Right on time.

19:55.972 --> 19:57.271
For what?
For you to try

19:57.273 --> 20:00.541
to strong-arm me into
charging Santiago Cabbad.

20:00.543 --> 20:01.676
What?

20:01.678 --> 20:02.710
You don't think
I get a heads-up

20:02.712 --> 20:04.545
the moment you arrive
and start badgering

20:04.547 --> 20:06.781
all the ADAs
about some case?

20:06.783 --> 20:08.549
Takes you 20 minutes
for them

20:08.551 --> 20:10.451
to shut you down,
and then you come up here.

20:10.453 --> 20:11.486
That is not true.

20:11.488 --> 20:14.355
Really?

20:14.357 --> 20:17.325
Okay, it is true.
Can you help?

20:17.327 --> 20:20.461
Sorry, Saul already
filled me in.

20:20.463 --> 20:23.631
Cabbad and his friends
testing positive for cocaine

20:23.633 --> 20:26.067
only proves that they partied
with Roland Jeffries,

20:26.069 --> 20:27.301
not that they killed him.

20:27.303 --> 20:28.469
Okay, so that's it?

20:28.471 --> 20:30.204
I am happy to charge
them with the drugs

20:30.206 --> 20:31.839
that you found
at their place.

20:31.841 --> 20:34.075
Great. So now I look like

20:34.077 --> 20:36.410
a complete idiot
for nothing.

20:38.414 --> 20:40.515
Can you help me with
something else, then?

20:40.517 --> 20:41.549
Sure.

20:41.551 --> 20:44.285
The other day,
Sean reminded me

20:44.287 --> 20:48.256
that, with their mom gone...

20:48.258 --> 20:49.357
the boys have
nobody else.

20:49.359 --> 20:50.958
If anything should
happen to me, that is.

20:50.960 --> 20:53.161
You know, they'd
be all alone.

20:53.163 --> 20:55.163
They're never gonna be
all alone.

20:55.165 --> 20:56.964
You know the way kids think.

20:56.966 --> 20:58.633
So now you're scared
of getting hurt?

20:58.635 --> 21:01.769
I'm not scared,
I'm just...

21:03.872 --> 21:05.973
Since Linda's been gone,

21:05.975 --> 21:08.009
I'm just having a hard time

21:08.011 --> 21:09.911
separating personal
from the job.

21:09.913 --> 21:11.012
Join the club.

21:11.014 --> 21:13.581
I may have gone after a guy
hammer and tongs

21:13.583 --> 21:15.049
back when I was
getting divorced,

21:15.051 --> 21:17.885
because deep down inside,
I was pissed at Jack.

21:18.754 --> 21:20.755
What's happening to us?

21:20.757 --> 21:24.225
Turns out, we may have flaws.

21:24.227 --> 21:25.826
Well, speak for yourself.

21:26.896 --> 21:28.062
It's the M.E.

21:28.064 --> 21:29.463
Reagan.

21:31.466 --> 21:32.934
Yeah.

21:35.637 --> 21:38.039
Yeah, I got it.

21:38.041 --> 21:39.840
Cabbad just squirmed free.

21:39.842 --> 21:41.776
Didn't make your Vic OD
on cocaine?

21:41.778 --> 21:43.411
The M.E. found coke
in his system,

21:43.413 --> 21:44.845
but that's not what killed him.

21:44.847 --> 21:46.480
What killed him
is a lethal injection

21:46.482 --> 21:49.417
of potassium chloride
mixed with morphine.

21:49.419 --> 21:51.886
Which is the same thing
they use in executions.

21:51.888 --> 21:55.423
So, too sophisticated
for a bottom-feeder like Cabbad.

21:55.425 --> 21:57.692
Way too sophisticated
for Cabbad.

21:57.694 --> 21:58.859
Which means the only thing
I have

21:58.861 --> 22:01.128
besides a dead body is squat.

22:09.518 --> 22:12.019
- Through Christ Our Lord, Amen.
- Amen.

22:12.921 --> 22:15.522
This whole daylight
savings time racket

22:15.524 --> 22:18.158
throws my digestive system off.

22:18.160 --> 22:19.359
Dinner table conversation.

22:19.361 --> 22:21.361
- Please.
- I just meant

22:21.363 --> 22:23.830
that I was hungry an hour ago
because of the time change.

22:23.832 --> 22:26.833
I wish they would
just do away with it.

22:26.835 --> 22:28.101
Write your congressman.

22:28.103 --> 22:30.770
Democrats don't have any strings
to pull these days.

22:31.606 --> 22:32.706
Some logic
you got there, Gramps.

22:32.708 --> 22:33.974
- Hmm.
- Speaking of which,

22:33.976 --> 22:35.642
I collared an artist the
other day on a felony

22:35.644 --> 22:37.043
criminal mischief.

22:37.045 --> 22:39.312
Throwing cans of paint out her
window, one of them hit our car.

22:39.314 --> 22:40.447
Did you hear about this?

22:40.449 --> 22:43.216
Something about it, yeah.

22:43.218 --> 22:44.784
Well, I ask when my grand jury
appearance is,

22:44.786 --> 22:46.086
and they tell me she walked.

22:46.088 --> 22:47.854
Said strings got pulled
from the top.

22:47.856 --> 22:49.055
Well, she didn't just walk.

22:49.057 --> 22:50.690
She got community service.

22:50.692 --> 22:52.359
That's it?

22:52.361 --> 22:54.461
That's it. Yeah.

22:54.463 --> 22:56.429
You don't think
we can't tell by now

22:56.431 --> 22:57.764
when you know more
than you're saying?

22:57.766 --> 22:58.965
Tight lips.

22:58.967 --> 23:00.267
That's how he got where he got.

23:00.269 --> 23:01.735
Wait, come on, Dad,
what's the story?

23:01.737 --> 23:05.105
She is being evicted
from her loft

23:05.107 --> 23:08.275
because the archdiocese sold
her building out from under her.

23:08.277 --> 23:11.178
So His Eminence asked me
to try to find a way

23:11.180 --> 23:13.046
to soften her landing.

23:13.048 --> 23:14.214
That's all.

23:14.216 --> 23:16.516
While the archdiocese cashes

23:16.518 --> 23:18.718
their tremendous check.
I mean, it's just not right.

23:18.720 --> 23:20.787
They're closing down schools.

23:20.789 --> 23:22.689
That's another thing you should
write the congressman about.

23:22.691 --> 23:23.823
Don't tempt me.

23:23.825 --> 23:25.258
Maybe they can close
down my school.

23:25.260 --> 23:26.359
That'd be cool.

23:26.361 --> 23:27.827
Oh, maybe we'll just
find you a stricter school.

23:27.829 --> 23:29.396
That'll be cool.

23:29.398 --> 23:31.998
What's her community service?

23:34.068 --> 23:35.569
Portraits.

23:35.571 --> 23:37.737
What was that, Francis?

23:40.208 --> 23:45.011
The mayor has ordered up a round
of new official portraits.

23:45.013 --> 23:46.780
Oh.

23:46.782 --> 23:48.682
And she's doing yours?

23:48.684 --> 23:50.617
Yes.

23:51.886 --> 23:55.121
What did you say this artist
looked like, exactly, Jamie?

23:55.123 --> 23:56.323
Smoking hot.

23:56.325 --> 23:58.291
Oh.

23:58.293 --> 24:00.694
Which has absolutely nothing
to do with anything.

24:00.696 --> 24:03.029
Right.
Which he says defensively.

24:03.031 --> 24:04.998
Which he said truthfully,
period.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.567
Could we just talk
about something else now?

24:07.569 --> 24:08.501
Sure.

24:08.503 --> 24:10.036
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

24:12.373 --> 24:14.808
So how does this
exactly happen...

24:14.810 --> 24:16.743
...getting your portrait painted?

24:16.745 --> 24:19.446
Yeah, do you get to, like,
pose in her studio for days?

24:20.281 --> 24:21.548
Dad, you should do this guy.

24:21.550 --> 24:22.916
No, Rocky.

24:22.918 --> 24:24.818
Balboa.

24:30.258 --> 24:32.192
Hey Regan.

24:32.194 --> 24:34.461
Morning.

24:34.463 --> 24:36.062
Hey. Hey.

24:36.064 --> 24:38.031
I've been thinking about who
else might've killed Roland J.

24:38.033 --> 24:39.232
And I don't want to hear it.

24:39.234 --> 24:40.700
Now what's your problem?

24:40.702 --> 24:43.370
I mean, I don't want to hear it
until I say what I got to say,

24:43.372 --> 24:45.138
which is, you were right.

24:45.140 --> 24:46.806
I've been all screwed
up in the head lately,

24:46.808 --> 24:48.275
and it's put me
on the back foot,

24:48.277 --> 24:49.843
and I should've told
you, but I didn't,

24:49.845 --> 24:52.279
so I'm sorry.

24:52.281 --> 24:54.247
Do you want to talk about it?

24:54.249 --> 24:56.249
Pretty sure I just
did talk about it.

24:56.251 --> 24:59.286
I guess a few drops of blood
from a stone is progress.

24:59.288 --> 25:01.454
All right. Tell me about
Roland's killer.

25:01.456 --> 25:03.723
I like JJ Baruch.
The agent?

25:03.725 --> 25:05.592
Who barely batted an eye at
the crime scene the other day.

25:05.594 --> 25:06.826
Well, what do you expect?
He's an agent.

25:06.828 --> 25:07.961
They don't care about people.

25:07.963 --> 25:09.229
They only care about money.

25:09.231 --> 25:12.265
Well, I also learned he took
out a life insurance policy

25:12.267 --> 25:14.034
on Roland just last year.

25:14.036 --> 25:16.436
Okay, now you have
my attention.

25:16.438 --> 25:18.438
And his brother is a doctor,

25:18.440 --> 25:19.673
which is where he
could've learned

25:19.675 --> 25:20.940
about potassium chloride.

25:20.942 --> 25:23.009
Okay, now you really got
my attention.

25:23.011 --> 25:24.344
Good. I'm glad you think so,

25:24.346 --> 25:26.313
because you get to search
the pharmacy records

25:26.315 --> 25:28.014
for anyone who's gotten
potassium chloride

25:28.016 --> 25:29.916
and morphine recently.
Come on.

25:29.918 --> 25:32.419
There's got to be a thousand
pharmacies in this city.

25:32.421 --> 25:33.920
I mean, there's one
on every street corner.

25:33.922 --> 25:36.389
Yeah. Well, then,
you better hop to it.

25:45.633 --> 25:47.367
Tina Araya.

25:50.171 --> 25:51.671
Ms. Reagan.

25:51.673 --> 25:55.175
Well. I'm surprised you remember
after all these years.

25:55.177 --> 25:56.443
You look good.

25:56.445 --> 26:00.113
Yeah. It's amazing
what kicking heroin can do

26:00.115 --> 26:01.715
to a girl's complexion.

26:03.184 --> 26:04.584
But that's not why you're here.

26:04.586 --> 26:06.319
No, it's not.

26:07.121 --> 26:08.922
You finally figured out
the truth.

26:11.158 --> 26:13.560
You want to tell me,
or should I lay it out for you?

26:15.830 --> 26:18.531
I lied about Mr. Gower
attacking me.

26:19.867 --> 26:22.068
Right.

26:23.070 --> 26:24.738
So who did it?

26:25.573 --> 26:27.574
My boyfriend, Max.

26:27.576 --> 26:28.608
But you told your neighbors,

26:28.610 --> 26:30.810
you told the police
that Norm did it.

26:30.812 --> 26:33.079
I just didn't want Max
to get in trouble.

26:33.081 --> 26:34.881
I know that sounds crazy,

26:34.883 --> 26:38.051
but back then we were so
wrapped up in the drugs.

26:38.053 --> 26:39.886
And Max got mad at me
because I didn't score that day,

26:39.888 --> 26:41.087
so he started beating me up,

26:41.089 --> 26:43.690
and I started
screaming, and then,

26:43.692 --> 26:45.959
suddenly, he ran off and
everyone starting showing up,

26:45.961 --> 26:47.093
so I had to
say something.

26:47.095 --> 26:48.795
We put an innocent man in jail

26:48.797 --> 26:49.963
for the past nine years.

26:49.965 --> 26:51.064
Not you, Ms. Reagan.

26:51.066 --> 26:52.132
Me.

26:52.134 --> 26:53.800
Okay? You just did your job.

26:53.802 --> 26:55.435
Where is Max?

26:55.437 --> 26:56.569
I don't know.

26:56.571 --> 26:58.872
He dumped me
a couple months later.

26:58.874 --> 27:00.306
I mean, I felt so
guilty about all of it,

27:00.308 --> 27:01.541
I decided
to get clean.

27:01.543 --> 27:03.743
And...

27:03.745 --> 27:06.713
So I can believe in myself.

27:06.715 --> 27:09.082
The way Norm
always believed in me.

27:09.084 --> 27:12.252
You knew I was gonna find out.

27:12.254 --> 27:13.420
I hoped you would.

27:13.422 --> 27:16.022
And...

27:16.024 --> 27:18.825
I destroyed Norm's life.

27:19.627 --> 27:21.461
So...

27:21.463 --> 27:24.230
Thank you.

27:24.232 --> 27:27.667
You know, for doing
what I never could do.

27:30.271 --> 27:32.205
Come on. Can't you just
take a look?

27:32.207 --> 27:33.440
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

27:33.442 --> 27:34.774
Look, all you got to do

27:34.776 --> 27:36.576
is just, you know,
tap a few keys here,

27:36.578 --> 27:38.077
bring up the names of anybody

27:38.079 --> 27:39.946
who's had morphine and potassium
chloride in the last few months.

27:39.948 --> 27:42.081
Yeah, we already did
all the hard work,

27:42.083 --> 27:44.050
digging through prescriptions
in millions of pharmacies.

27:44.052 --> 27:45.952
And by "we," she means "me."

27:45.954 --> 27:47.520
To disclose
that name would be

27:47.522 --> 27:49.456
to violate federal
HIPAA regulations.

27:49.458 --> 27:50.690
You know what HIPAA
stands for, right?

27:50.692 --> 27:51.758
Yes.

27:51.760 --> 27:53.493
The Health Insurance
Portability...

27:53.495 --> 27:55.495
And Accountability Act.
I already know that. Okay?

27:55.497 --> 27:57.297
But just help us out. Come on.

27:57.299 --> 27:59.599
You want the name,
get a warrant.

27:59.601 --> 28:01.801
What if you just tell us
the person's initials?

28:01.803 --> 28:05.472
Or what if I attend to customers
who need my assistance?

28:05.474 --> 28:07.040
Mrs. Dettenmeier.

28:07.042 --> 28:08.842
Let me see if that
prescription's ready.

28:08.844 --> 28:10.210
So what's next?
We pick up Baruch

28:10.212 --> 28:11.711
and try to sweat
a confession out of him?

28:11.713 --> 28:13.913
I don't know.

28:22.356 --> 28:24.457
One second.

28:24.459 --> 28:26.693
Excuse me.

28:27.728 --> 28:28.962
Fan of Roland Jeffries, huh?

28:28.964 --> 28:30.630
Yo, can you believe he's gone?

28:30.632 --> 28:32.632
Tell me about it.
It's heartbreaking.

28:32.634 --> 28:35.335
You interested in any, uh,
Roland Jeffries merchandise?

28:35.337 --> 28:36.169
Are you kidding?

28:36.171 --> 28:38.304
Well, I know his agent, uh,

28:38.306 --> 28:39.839
JJ Baruch.
He's got a bunch

28:39.841 --> 28:41.774
of signed stuff,
and he gives it to me,

28:41.776 --> 28:43.109
but I have no use for it.

28:43.111 --> 28:44.477
That'd be tight.

28:44.479 --> 28:47.080
Great. Great.

28:47.082 --> 28:49.749
I just need you to do
one thing for me.

28:54.122 --> 28:55.388
- You get it?
- Sure did.

28:55.390 --> 28:56.489
Good.

28:56.491 --> 28:58.324
Your boss didn't see?
I told him someone

28:58.326 --> 28:59.993
in the heartburn aisle
had questions for him.

28:59.995 --> 29:02.362
Good man.
Hey, what about my merch?

29:04.164 --> 29:06.299
This is my card.
You call me in a week,

29:06.301 --> 29:08.234
you'll get your merch.
You know I will.

29:08.236 --> 29:09.536
I'm sure you will, now beat it.

29:09.538 --> 29:10.703
All right, what do you got?

29:10.705 --> 29:12.605
Someone named Diane Vickers?

29:12.607 --> 29:14.340
Vickers. That's the, uh,

29:14.342 --> 29:16.276
the girl in the hotel
who I spoke to

29:16.278 --> 29:17.510
while you were
speaking to Baruch.

29:17.512 --> 29:18.478
Diane?

29:18.480 --> 29:20.013
No, it wasn't Diane,
it was Darla.

29:20.015 --> 29:21.447
You think it's any relation?

29:21.449 --> 29:23.683
There's only one way
to find out.

29:24.952 --> 29:27.887
I'm just gonna
have you sit here.

29:29.156 --> 29:30.957
And this is just for the light.

29:30.959 --> 29:33.893
The, uh, the background
will actually be different.

29:33.895 --> 29:36.095
The city in flames?

29:36.097 --> 29:37.397
Why would you say that?

29:37.399 --> 29:39.899
Your work wasn't always
so apolitical.

29:39.901 --> 29:44.037
My work is still political,
just in a different way.

29:44.039 --> 29:45.538
And how would you know?

29:48.075 --> 29:49.208
Different how?

29:49.210 --> 29:52.812
I always tried to paint
what I saw.

29:52.814 --> 29:56.082
New York in the late '70s.

29:56.084 --> 29:58.751
AIDS, "Giuliani time."

29:58.753 --> 30:01.054
But this isn't that.

30:01.056 --> 30:04.991
No... no.

30:06.093 --> 30:08.928
Now I paint the New York
that I miss.

30:08.930 --> 30:13.633
The one where the loft we're in
wasn't the price of a mansion.

30:13.635 --> 30:17.270
I miss that New York, too.

30:18.606 --> 30:20.907
What's going on here,
Mr. Reagan?

30:22.509 --> 30:26.145
I'm sitting for my portrait,
and please call me Frank.

30:27.982 --> 30:31.150
Okay, Frank.

30:31.152 --> 30:33.353
But there's something else.

30:38.759 --> 30:42.228
Early in the evening
in the blackout of '77,

30:42.230 --> 30:43.496
you came up to a cop

30:43.498 --> 30:46.099
on the corner of Bleecker
and MacDougal.

30:48.636 --> 30:52.739
You couldn't reach the friends
you were supposed to crash with.

30:52.741 --> 30:55.842
And I ended up in a bar.

30:55.844 --> 30:57.844
I knew the bartender.

30:57.846 --> 31:01.180
Georgie Boy Farrell.

31:01.182 --> 31:05.251
Anyway, I came by later at
closing time to check on you.

31:05.253 --> 31:09.489
And I'd gotten
pretty drunk, I guess.

31:09.491 --> 31:10.957
Yeah, but one of the waitresses
had a couch,

31:10.959 --> 31:13.726
and she offered to put you up,
so I knew you'd be okay.

31:13.728 --> 31:17.296
Oh.

31:17.298 --> 31:19.999
Did we...?

31:23.137 --> 31:25.905
No.

31:25.907 --> 31:29.275
But you kissed me.

31:29.277 --> 31:32.278
And not just for a second.

31:32.280 --> 31:34.947
I kissed a lot of guys
in those days.

31:34.949 --> 31:38.051
And I kissed one girl a lot
in those days.

31:38.053 --> 31:39.719
My wife.

31:41.689 --> 31:44.223
But I remembered your name.

31:44.225 --> 31:47.627
And I thought people like you
who came to New York

31:47.629 --> 31:49.095
in those mean old days

31:49.097 --> 31:51.330
were like lambs
to the slaughter.

31:52.700 --> 31:56.836
I don't know,
I guess that's how it stuck.

31:59.039 --> 32:01.607
Yikes.

32:01.609 --> 32:06.746
So... I would check
the <i>Village Voice,</i>

32:06.748 --> 32:11.918
and go to galleries
where you showed

32:11.920 --> 32:14.987
and...

32:14.989 --> 32:17.223
do you have a camera?

32:17.225 --> 32:19.826
Uh, sure. Why?

32:19.828 --> 32:21.627
Well, you're gonna have
to take a couple of snaps

32:21.629 --> 32:23.029
and paint from that.

32:23.031 --> 32:25.898
I am, after all, the police
commissioner of New York City.

32:25.900 --> 32:28.301
I do not have time
to sit for portraits.

32:28.303 --> 32:30.703
Of course.

32:33.841 --> 32:35.875
At a certain point,
I think it's important

32:35.877 --> 32:39.178
to take stock of what you had.

32:39.180 --> 32:41.614
But also...

32:41.616 --> 32:46.219
if you get the chance,
what you missed, too.

32:54.061 --> 32:55.628
Don't you think?

32:55.630 --> 32:57.830
Yeah.

33:04.304 --> 33:06.506
That's all this is.

33:12.346 --> 33:16.516
Frank, did you ever think
to come to an opening, you know?

33:16.518 --> 33:17.817
Come up and say hi?

33:17.819 --> 33:21.654
Yeah.

33:21.656 --> 33:23.723
I thought it.

33:46.471 --> 33:47.571
Hey, Darla.

33:47.573 --> 33:48.639
Detectives.

33:48.641 --> 33:49.974
Uh, we had a few questions.

33:49.976 --> 33:51.108
Do you mind if we come in?

33:51.110 --> 33:53.110
Of course.

33:53.112 --> 33:54.979
It's okay. Shh, shh.

33:54.981 --> 33:57.047
Who is this?
My son, Evan.

33:57.049 --> 33:58.515
He's a cutie.

33:58.517 --> 33:59.917
Yeah.

33:59.919 --> 34:02.453
Um...

34:02.455 --> 34:04.288
who's Diane Vickers?

34:04.290 --> 34:05.356
My mother.

34:05.358 --> 34:07.024
Your mother.

34:07.026 --> 34:08.092
Um, is she here?

34:08.094 --> 34:09.193
Could we talk to her?

34:09.195 --> 34:10.627
Mom!

34:10.629 --> 34:12.763
- Can you come out here?
- Yes.

34:12.764 --> 34:16.100
Let me put him down.
I'll be right back.

34:22.706 --> 34:24.608
Hi, I'm Detective Reagan.

34:24.610 --> 34:26.877
This is my partner,
Detective Baez.

34:26.879 --> 34:29.279
You have a prescription
for potassium chloride,

34:29.281 --> 34:30.280
is that right?

34:30.282 --> 34:33.516
And about ten million
other things.

34:33.518 --> 34:35.185
Furosemide

34:35.187 --> 34:37.353
for my blood pressure,

34:37.356 --> 34:38.922
beta blockers
for my arrhythmia,

34:38.924 --> 34:40.824
modafinil

34:40.826 --> 34:42.592
to wake me up,

34:42.594 --> 34:45.295
morphine to help me sleep.

34:45.297 --> 34:48.197
Here's the boxes for potassium.

34:48.199 --> 34:51.034
Which is odd because I don't
think I take it anymore.

34:51.036 --> 34:52.136
You don't think?

34:52.138 --> 34:54.538
Some of my meds
make me forgetful.

34:54.540 --> 34:57.241
That's why Darla is in charge
of everything.

34:57.243 --> 34:58.675
She is?

34:58.677 --> 35:00.310
Yes, Darla's in charge

35:00.312 --> 35:02.679
of all of my prescriptions.
Picking them up,

35:02.681 --> 35:05.149
making sure I take the right one
at the right time.

35:05.151 --> 35:07.284
Ooh, she's a godsend.

35:07.286 --> 35:09.119
She sure is.

35:09.121 --> 35:11.555
Ah, we're gonna go
talk to her now, okay?

35:11.557 --> 35:13.724
Is everything okay?

35:13.726 --> 35:15.426
Darla.

35:16.294 --> 35:18.262
Darla!

35:23.735 --> 35:25.569
Darla.

35:27.372 --> 35:30.441
Ms. Vickers, can you come down
here and watch the baby?

35:30.443 --> 35:32.876
It's okay. Where's your mom?

35:36.981 --> 35:38.949
Go that way.

35:43.621 --> 35:44.922
Darla, stop!

35:51.396 --> 35:52.896
Hey!

35:52.898 --> 35:54.231
Hold it!

35:55.266 --> 35:57.267
Hey, stop!
Leave me alone!

35:57.269 --> 35:59.236
Stop.

35:59.238 --> 36:01.505
Put the scissors down.

36:01.507 --> 36:03.407
Come on, put 'em down.

36:03.409 --> 36:05.375
No, you should
want me to die.

36:05.377 --> 36:06.610
You know what I did.

36:06.612 --> 36:07.811
I don't want anyone to die.

36:07.813 --> 36:09.379
Okay? But you're gonna
get yourself killed

36:09.381 --> 36:11.782
or hit by a car if you don't
step away from the street.

36:11.784 --> 36:13.951
Come on. Talk about what
happened with Roland, okay?

36:13.953 --> 36:14.918
Come on.

36:14.920 --> 36:17.287
Stop! Stop.

36:20.625 --> 36:23.894
He was here last year...

36:23.896 --> 36:25.429
for the same award show.

36:25.431 --> 36:29.166
I brought him room service
and he poured me a drink.

36:30.502 --> 36:35.305
When I found out I was pregnant,
I-I called him,

36:35.307 --> 36:36.807
but he hung up.

36:38.576 --> 36:41.278
And I told his agent,
and he said I was lying,

36:41.280 --> 36:43.580
and-and that-that they'd sue me.

36:43.582 --> 36:46.083
They did you wrong, okay?
I get it.

36:46.085 --> 36:47.184
I wouldn't have killed him

36:47.186 --> 36:50.020
if he had just acted
like me and Evan exist.

36:50.022 --> 36:51.822
Evan does exist.

36:51.824 --> 36:53.157
And he needs his mom.

36:53.159 --> 36:54.525
No, not if I'm in jail.

36:54.527 --> 36:56.560
All kids need their moms.
All right?

36:56.562 --> 36:59.296
And they need them alive.

36:59.298 --> 37:01.330
Just put the scissors down,
get out of the street.

37:01.331 --> 37:01.731
No.

37:01.734 --> 37:03.700
And let's go give your boy
a hug, okay?

37:03.702 --> 37:04.701
Come on.

37:05.905 --> 37:07.437
Come on.
Please.

37:07.439 --> 37:10.174
Thanks for helping me.

37:11.176 --> 37:13.343
But it's too late.

37:13.345 --> 37:14.878
Hey!

37:23.788 --> 37:26.023
All right?

37:35.700 --> 37:37.868
My investigator, Anthony,
tracked down Max

37:37.870 --> 37:40.904
in East New York,
and with his confession

37:40.906 --> 37:42.539
and Tina recanting
her testimony,

37:42.541 --> 37:44.675
the judge has agreed

37:44.677 --> 37:46.510
to dismissing
the original charges

37:46.512 --> 37:49.046
and vacating
your felony conviction.

37:49.048 --> 37:52.816
I can't believe it.

37:52.818 --> 37:55.652
On behalf of this office
and me, personally,

37:55.654 --> 38:00.490
I'd like to apologize for
the injustice you have endured.

38:00.492 --> 38:03.694
The State endeavors
to render

38:03.696 --> 38:05.562
a true verdict in every case,

38:05.564 --> 38:09.166
but we clearly failed
in this one.

38:10.201 --> 38:15.472
And... without your wife
and the unconventional way

38:15.474 --> 38:17.841
she brought it to my attention,

38:17.843 --> 38:20.377
this wrong would have gone
uncorrected.

38:20.379 --> 38:23.580
All I ever wanted was for
people to know I'm innocent.

38:23.582 --> 38:28.619
Well, there is someone else
who would like to apologize.

38:31.923 --> 38:34.391
Tina.

38:35.693 --> 38:37.628
I'll step outside.

38:40.298 --> 38:42.399
Mr. Gower,

38:42.401 --> 38:43.867
look, I know I changed
your life horribly.

38:48.339 --> 38:50.307
No, you heard me right.

38:50.309 --> 38:52.509
I would like you
to reinstate the compensation

38:52.511 --> 38:54.544
for Ms. Slaughter's eviction.

38:54.546 --> 38:55.879
That ship has sailed.

38:55.881 --> 38:57.447
Call it back to the dock.

38:57.449 --> 38:58.749
I can't.

38:58.751 --> 39:01.318
Frank, the final selling price
subtracted that offer.

39:01.320 --> 39:03.186
It's already done.

39:03.188 --> 39:04.721
I can't claw back
a million dollars.

39:04.723 --> 39:08.086
In addition, the archdiocese
will reimburse her

39:08.087 --> 39:09.982
for her legal and
moving expenses.

39:10.006 --> 39:11.696
Or what?

39:11.697 --> 39:15.899
Or I think the story you came to
me to prevent from getting out

39:15.901 --> 39:18.468
could get out.

39:18.470 --> 39:20.537
You're extorting the Church?

39:20.539 --> 39:22.806
Oh, come on, Kevin.
You came to me.

39:22.808 --> 39:25.742
I came to you as a friend,
as an envoy of our Lord.

39:25.744 --> 39:29.146
As a New Yorker looking to get
a New York problem fixed,

39:29.148 --> 39:31.682
just like a thousand other folks
who came through that door.

39:31.684 --> 39:32.949
Oh, I'm disappointed, Frank.

39:32.951 --> 39:34.051
I'm shocked and I'm dismayed.

39:34.053 --> 39:37.020
Well, don't be.
It's just business.

39:37.022 --> 39:38.088
Is it really?

39:38.090 --> 39:40.457
What's that supposed to mean?

39:40.459 --> 39:42.893
It doesn't sound to me
like "it's just business."

39:42.895 --> 39:46.196
If it means do I have
a personal interest in this,

39:46.198 --> 39:48.031
I do not.

39:48.033 --> 39:49.232
Then why the hard line?

39:49.234 --> 39:52.169
The Trudy Slaughters
of this city

39:52.171 --> 39:55.305
are what gives your real estate
its outrageous value.

39:55.307 --> 39:58.508
Your profits are built
on the pioneering they did

39:58.510 --> 40:00.010
their whole lives.

40:00.012 --> 40:02.679
So consider it a bargain.

40:02.681 --> 40:05.549
For who? You or me?

40:09.220 --> 40:11.455
How's it going over there?

40:11.457 --> 40:13.290
I'm all done.

40:13.292 --> 40:15.392
Mm, good.

40:15.394 --> 40:17.994
So, maybe we can have
a little talk?

40:17.996 --> 40:19.996
I feel bad about
what I said.

40:19.998 --> 40:23.400
Never feel bad about telling me
the truth, okay?

40:23.402 --> 40:27.437
Besides, you... you made me
think about some things

40:27.439 --> 40:29.840
I probably should've
thought about a long time ago.

40:29.842 --> 40:32.109
Like what?

40:32.111 --> 40:34.845
Like if you and your brother
think me being a cop

40:34.847 --> 40:36.012
is too dangerous...

40:36.014 --> 40:37.481
I don't want you to quit.

40:37.483 --> 40:39.015
I just want you to be safe.

40:39.017 --> 40:42.853
Okay.

40:42.855 --> 40:45.288
But from now on, you and
your brother do get a vote.

40:45.290 --> 40:46.757
All right?

40:47.792 --> 40:49.960
Everything will be
a family decision

40:49.962 --> 40:52.129
because that's what we are
and that's what we'll always be,

40:52.131 --> 40:53.797
a family.

40:53.799 --> 40:56.500
Me, you, your brother
and your ma.

40:56.502 --> 40:57.534
God rest her soul.

40:57.536 --> 40:58.735
She was brave for you.

40:58.737 --> 41:00.103
We can be brave, too.

41:00.105 --> 41:03.607
I think she'd like that.

41:25.063 --> 41:26.530
It's not what you expected.

41:27.298 --> 41:30.367
I didn't know
what to expect.
