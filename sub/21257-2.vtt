WEBVTT

00:07.908 --> 00:09.243
(man)
Up next, the results
of the weekly weigh-in.

00:09.243 --> 00:10.578
Now back to Mandy.

00:10.578 --> 00:12.580
(Mandy)
Remember, fat is the enemy!

00:12.580 --> 00:15.583
I am fat!
I am the enemy.

00:15.583 --> 00:18.586
You gotta lose weight
if you wanna look great!

00:18.586 --> 00:20.754
I gotta lose weight
to look great

00:20.754 --> 00:23.757
for my high school reunion-
slash-pool party.

00:23.757 --> 00:26.960
Hey, great work, guys!
Hey, time for a healthy snack!

00:26.960 --> 00:29.430
Whew!
Time for a low-fat snack.

00:29.430 --> 00:30.364
(cartoon whale laughing)

00:32.366 --> 00:33.567
Come on, Sam.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.103
You can change
this monster body.

00:35.103 --> 00:37.138
All you gotta do is eat
low-fat foods,

00:37.138 --> 00:39.707
track your calories,
and work out like crazy.

00:39.707 --> 00:40.974
Actually...
Aah!

00:40.974 --> 00:42.643
Man in my fridge!

00:42.643 --> 00:45.246
None of the things
you're doing are likely
to make you lose weight.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.980
You ruined my fridge!

00:46.980 --> 00:48.782
Yeah, because
I'm Adam Conover,

00:48.782 --> 00:50.784
and this is
"Adam Ruins Everything."

00:50.784 --> 00:51.785
**

00:51.785 --> 00:52.720
Oh!
Ugh.

00:54.322 --> 00:55.289
(screaming)

01:01.329 --> 01:03.063
Thanks for letting me
out of that fridge.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.998
It got really creepy
in there overnight.

01:04.998 --> 01:07.468
Ugh! You spilled
my low-fat yogurt!

01:07.468 --> 01:08.669
I need this
so I can lose weight

01:08.669 --> 01:10.338
for my high school
reunion pool party.

01:10.338 --> 01:13.141
Wait, who would combine
a high school reunion
with a pool party?

01:13.141 --> 01:14.908
Sociopaths.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.311
Sociopaths with
rock-hard bodies.

01:17.311 --> 01:20.248
Even worse, my high school
crush is gonna be there.

01:20.248 --> 01:22.015
Marcy Leonardo.

01:22.015 --> 01:24.485
(male singers)
Marc *

01:24.485 --> 01:26.154
And if I want to look
good for Marcy,

01:26.154 --> 01:27.955
I gotta eat nothing
but low-fat foods.

01:27.955 --> 01:29.823
Just like Snacky
the Snack Whale says.

01:29.823 --> 01:31.359
(Snacky laughs)

01:31.359 --> 01:32.693
I'll never be
as cut as that whale.

01:32.693 --> 01:35.629
Sorry, but low-fat foods
don't help you lose weight.

01:35.629 --> 01:36.997
And the only reason
you think they do

01:36.997 --> 01:39.600
is because
of bad science
and worse marketing.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.135
Heh!
That's ridiculous.

01:41.135 --> 01:43.871
When I eat fat, it goes
in my body and becomes fat,

01:43.871 --> 01:45.105
and fat is bad.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.607
Yeah, that's what
everybody thinks,

01:46.607 --> 01:47.875
but it's not true.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.677
Oh, hey, an egg timer!

01:49.677 --> 01:52.713
(timer tingling)

01:52.713 --> 01:54.682
(blows)
People have been eating fat

01:54.682 --> 01:56.517
for as long
as humans have existed,

01:56.517 --> 01:57.885
and their lives
were swell.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.520
(whoosh)

01:59.520 --> 02:01.655
Fat tastes good!

02:01.655 --> 02:05.459
Also, salve
for tiger wound.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.361
Okay, maybe not swell.

02:07.361 --> 02:09.363
The point is, fat
is one of our oldest

02:09.363 --> 02:11.031
and most basic nutrients.

02:11.031 --> 02:13.334
Wow, thank you
for the history
lesson, Adam.

02:13.334 --> 02:14.802
But I need
to lose weight,

02:14.802 --> 02:17.405
and the most
important thing is
for me to cut out fat.

02:17.405 --> 02:20.308
Yep, that's what
the sugar industry
wants you to think.

02:20.308 --> 02:22.210
(whoosh)

02:22.210 --> 02:24.212
** (upbeat jazz playing)

02:24.212 --> 02:25.379
Holy, hambone!

02:25.379 --> 02:26.880
Are you trying to
give me a heart attack?

02:26.880 --> 02:28.048
Funny you should
say that,

02:28.048 --> 02:29.650
because in the early
20th century,

02:29.650 --> 02:32.085
doctors began to notice
a disturbing rise

02:32.085 --> 02:34.922
in a once rare condition
called heart disease.

02:34.922 --> 02:37.758
Americans' hearts
are failing.

02:37.758 --> 02:40.561
But where will
the love go?

02:40.561 --> 02:42.196
And when
President Eisenhower

02:42.196 --> 02:44.398
suffered a heart attack
in 1955,

02:44.398 --> 02:46.200
it galvanized
the nation.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.902
Mmm, mmm--
(gasps)

02:48.902 --> 02:52.540
Someone look into this!
Uhh!

02:52.540 --> 02:54.908
Americans were
determined to
fight heart disease,

02:54.908 --> 02:57.778
but instead,
they were bamboozled
by the sugar industry

02:57.778 --> 03:00.448
and one very suave
scientist.

03:00.448 --> 03:01.915
(whoosh)

03:01.915 --> 03:05.118
This is Ancel Keys,
a scientist so popular,

03:05.118 --> 03:07.455
he once made the cover
of "Time" magazine.

03:07.455 --> 03:08.689
(camera shutters clicking,
people cheering)

03:08.689 --> 03:09.923
(wolf whistle)

03:12.092 --> 03:13.261
Keys was certain
that fat

03:13.261 --> 03:14.762
was the cause
of heart disease,

03:14.762 --> 03:16.864
but only because
he cherry-picked his data

03:16.864 --> 03:18.266
to get the result
he wanted.

03:18.266 --> 03:22.236
This data's out of sight!
This data can sit on it!

03:22.236 --> 03:25.105
Fat makes you fat.
Ehh!

03:25.105 --> 03:27.741
(people laugh and hoot)

03:27.741 --> 03:29.610
And nobody cared that
his research was bad?

03:29.610 --> 03:30.811
Not really.

03:30.811 --> 03:34.114
Except for one slightly
less popular scientist

03:34.114 --> 03:35.883
named John Yudkin.

03:35.883 --> 03:38.719
Actually, sugar
is the likely culprit.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.922
When you eat more sugar
than your liver can
normally process,

03:41.922 --> 03:43.491
it's stored as fat.

03:43.491 --> 03:44.958
Hey, get a load
of the nerd!

03:44.958 --> 03:46.994
(laughter)

03:46.994 --> 03:48.228
Keys denounced Yudkin

03:48.228 --> 03:49.897
and made fun of his
research in public.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.333
(Yudkin stammering)

03:52.333 --> 03:54.635
Fat makes you fat.
End of story!

03:54.635 --> 03:55.903
(people cheering)

03:55.903 --> 03:57.571
And people
just believed this jerk?

03:57.571 --> 03:59.139
Yeah, because
of a big assist

03:59.139 --> 04:01.942
from a group with
a sickly sweet agenda,

04:01.942 --> 04:03.311
the sugar industry.
(pop music playing)

04:03.311 --> 04:05.979
In the '60s, these
candy-coated capitalists

04:05.979 --> 04:07.948
started straight up
paying scientists

04:07.948 --> 04:09.750
to downplay
the dangers of sugar

04:09.750 --> 04:11.985
and shift
the blame to fat.

04:11.985 --> 04:13.954
Here's a little something
for that big

04:13.954 --> 04:15.989
"fat problem" we have.

04:15.989 --> 04:18.158
You got it, sugar.
(music stops)

04:18.158 --> 04:19.760
I mean, "you"
the sugar industry.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.529
I wasn't
calling you "sugar."

04:21.529 --> 04:24.665
When John Yudkin spoke out
against sugar in 1972,

04:24.665 --> 04:27.167
the industry
publicly mocked him,

04:27.167 --> 04:29.437
calling his research
"science fiction."

04:29.437 --> 04:32.640
Now, now, we've been
eating fat for millennia,

04:32.640 --> 04:35.175
but if we track the rise
in sugar consumption,

04:35.175 --> 04:36.944
there's a clear correlation
with the rise

04:36.944 --> 04:39.179
in heart disease
and obesity.

04:39.179 --> 04:42.015
(laughing)
If we track the rise
of sugar consumption!

04:42.015 --> 04:43.984
Live long and prosper!
Beep beep!

04:43.984 --> 04:45.453
I am a sugar robot!

04:45.453 --> 04:48.288
(laughter)
I am not a sugar robot.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.723
I'm not!

04:49.723 --> 04:52.159
The sad truth is,
Yudkin was right.

04:52.159 --> 04:54.161
We now know that sugar
is linked

04:54.161 --> 04:56.530
to both heart disease
and weight gain

04:56.530 --> 05:00.167
and has been found to be
more addictive than cocaine.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.304
But Keyes
and sugar industry

05:04.304 --> 05:06.407
spent so many years
swaying the research

05:06.407 --> 05:09.543
that by the time
that Yudkin retired,
the public was convinced.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.379
Despite being right
the whole time,

05:11.379 --> 05:14.214
he died in obscurity.

05:14.214 --> 05:16.216
(wind blows)

05:16.216 --> 05:18.586
Wow. Science is
a harsh business.

05:18.586 --> 05:21.689
And Big Sweet's relentless
lobbying didn't stop there.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.724
They spent years
packing health panels

05:23.724 --> 05:25.659
with sugar-friendly
scientists.

05:25.659 --> 05:28.195
We need reliable,
objective research!

05:28.195 --> 05:30.263
I've got just the man.
(drum roll)

05:30.263 --> 05:33.401
(playing whistle)
Fat's bad.

05:33.401 --> 05:35.569
Their campaign reached
its sugar height

05:35.569 --> 05:37.738
when the USDA
officially recommended

05:37.738 --> 05:40.741
a low-fat diet in 1980.

05:40.741 --> 05:43.444
("Star Spangled Banner" plays)
Fat is the enemy!

05:43.444 --> 05:44.745
(laughter)

05:44.745 --> 05:47.948
This lead to a full-blown
craze for low-fat food

05:47.948 --> 05:49.249
starting in the '80s.

05:49.249 --> 05:52.285
It eventually became
a $32 billion industry.

05:52.285 --> 05:54.422
And misleading ads
made it sound like

05:54.422 --> 05:56.790
we could eat
as much low-fat
food as we wanted

05:56.790 --> 05:59.192
and never
gain weight.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.629
(female announcer)
McDonald's new low-fat
frozen yogurt.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.764
(male announcer)
It tastes fattening
but if feels skinny.

06:03.764 --> 06:06.800
You can eat cake!

06:06.800 --> 06:09.437
What about the fat?
No fat!

06:09.437 --> 06:11.138
(woman #1)
So how can she eat like that?

06:11.138 --> 06:12.440
(woman #2)
And still be a size six?

06:12.440 --> 06:15.443
Oh, this isn't a cookie.
It's a fat-free Newton.

06:15.443 --> 06:18.879
Yes, and once everyone
switched to low-fat foods,

06:18.879 --> 06:20.581
everyone started
getting thinner.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.550
Right?
Quite the opposite.

06:22.550 --> 06:24.785
After the USDA
came out against fat,

06:24.785 --> 06:27.120
obesity rates
actually skyrocketed.

06:28.589 --> 06:31.258
(laughing)
But why?!

06:31.258 --> 06:33.761
Low-fat foods must help me
lose weight.

06:33.761 --> 06:36.430
I mean, I'm cutting out
something, right?
Wrong.

06:36.430 --> 06:39.266
When you take the fat out,
it makes food taste worse,

06:39.266 --> 06:40.668
so to make it
more palatable,

06:40.668 --> 06:42.936
food companies typically
a little something--

06:42.936 --> 06:44.905
piles and piles of sugar.

06:46.306 --> 06:50.077
Oh! This fat-free cake
tastes like Styrofoam, y'all.

06:50.077 --> 06:53.614
Let's just add
a little sugar.

06:53.614 --> 06:56.450
And... much better.

06:56.450 --> 06:58.486
(giggles)
Now, let's talk about

06:58.486 --> 07:01.421
why I think white sugar
is superior to brown--

07:01.421 --> 07:04.825
Okay, that's enough!
Oh, yikes.

07:04.825 --> 07:07.828
But you said
that sugar makes
you gain weight.

07:07.828 --> 07:08.829
Exactly.

07:08.829 --> 07:11.131
The sugar industry
peddled bad science

07:11.131 --> 07:14.267
and demonized fat
in order to sell us
more of the product

07:14.267 --> 07:17.170
that actually causes
heart disease and weight gain.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.839
And now, eating
so much sugar

07:18.839 --> 07:21.509
has made us fatter
and unhealthier.

07:21.509 --> 07:23.210
Et tu, Snacky?

07:23.210 --> 07:25.946
Sorry, Sam, it's true!
(laughs)

07:25.946 --> 07:27.815
(growling angrily)

07:30.183 --> 07:31.885
(fitness tracker beeps)

07:31.885 --> 07:33.353
Whew! Okay.

07:33.353 --> 07:35.856
At least that little
outburst helped me
burn a few calories.

07:35.856 --> 07:36.957
I guess I'll just
have to rely on

07:36.957 --> 07:38.792
good, old-fashioned
calorie counting,

07:38.792 --> 07:41.228
the scientific
and precise way
to lose weight.

07:41.228 --> 07:44.064
Actually, counting calories
is totally imprecise.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.033
Want me to tell you
about it?

07:46.033 --> 07:49.202
(screaming angrily)

07:49.202 --> 07:51.505
(fitness tracker beeping)

07:56.209 --> 07:58.478
Whoa!
Where we goin'?

07:58.478 --> 08:00.514
I am off to
count calories

08:00.514 --> 08:02.716
so that I can lose weight
and look good for Marcy.

08:02.716 --> 08:05.218
(singers)
Marc *

08:05.218 --> 08:07.988
Sorry, but calorie counts
are so difficult to measure,

08:07.988 --> 08:10.057
they're basically
useless for weight-loss.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.224
Yeah, right.

08:11.224 --> 08:13.894
Everyone knows that you
need 2,000 per day,

08:13.894 --> 08:15.428
and if you have
less than 2,000,

08:15.428 --> 08:17.064
you automatically
lose weight.

08:17.064 --> 08:20.601
All I have to do is calculate
that number exactly.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.736
It's like a fun little
math equation that
makes your hungry.

08:22.736 --> 08:27.107
Ah, yes, the fabled
government-recommended
2,000 calories.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.076
So clean, so exact,

08:29.076 --> 08:31.044
and so totally wrong.

08:31.044 --> 08:34.114
The way the government
got that number
is real stupid.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.584
Our citizens can't
think for themselves.

08:36.584 --> 08:38.418
How much should they
eat in a day?

08:38.418 --> 08:40.688
Well, everyone's body
has different needs,

08:40.688 --> 08:44.091
but I guess if you were
to grossly over-generalize
and average them,

08:44.091 --> 08:46.093
you'd get 2,350 calories.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.961
Oh, say, can I see that?

08:47.961 --> 08:50.263
2,350? Yuck!

08:50.263 --> 08:52.800
How are you
supposed to remember
such a weird number?

08:52.800 --> 08:55.235
Let's round it down
to 2,000.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.404
The fatties'll
thank us later.

08:57.404 --> 08:59.406
So they literally
just rounded down?

08:59.406 --> 09:01.575
Yes, they quite
literally did.

09:01.575 --> 09:04.277
And the fact is, any single
number would be wrong,

09:04.277 --> 09:05.946
because there is
a massive variation

09:05.946 --> 09:08.481
in the number of calories
needed by men, women,

09:08.481 --> 09:11.118
the elderly, tall people,
short people,

09:11.118 --> 09:12.419
every people
in the background

09:12.419 --> 09:13.954
who aren't supposed
to be part of our show.

09:13.954 --> 09:16.289
It's basically impossible
to know with precision

09:16.289 --> 09:18.826
exactly how many calories
your body needs.

09:18.826 --> 09:20.994
Oh, but I can still
cut calories

09:20.994 --> 09:22.462
but reading labels.

09:22.462 --> 09:23.964
See, 100 calories.

09:23.964 --> 09:26.066
Simple, precise,
scientific.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.001
And essentially a guess.

09:28.001 --> 09:30.337
Calorie counts on labels
are often estimated

09:30.337 --> 09:32.339
based on century-old data.

09:32.339 --> 09:35.475
Well, this old one
is 100 calories.

09:35.475 --> 09:38.278
So I guess this one is
100 calories.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.981
And the FDA legally
allows calorie labels

09:40.981 --> 09:43.150
to be off by 20%

09:43.150 --> 09:46.654
Or maybe it's 80 calories.
Or 120.

09:46.654 --> 09:48.622
Who knows?
I'm lazy.

09:48.622 --> 09:50.157
And that's just
packaged foods.

09:50.157 --> 09:52.592
Calories in fresh foods
can vary year to year

09:52.592 --> 09:54.828
or even item to item.

09:54.828 --> 09:57.330
Step right up,
try your luck!

09:57.330 --> 09:58.999
Guess which
farm-fresh meal

09:58.999 --> 10:01.601
is 700 calories
and which is 1,000.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.703
But beware!

10:02.703 --> 10:05.172
Guess wrong and you'll
ruin your waistline.

10:05.172 --> 10:07.440
And restaurant food
is the worst.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.176
One study found that
menu listings

10:09.176 --> 10:12.179
are often off
by hundreds of calories.

10:12.179 --> 10:15.515
Aren't you worried
about misleading
your customers?

10:15.515 --> 10:18.719
Honey, I serve food
out of a wagon.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.220
(fitness tracker beeping)

10:20.220 --> 10:22.455
Wait, yes!

10:22.455 --> 10:24.357
My fitness tracker
is scientific,

10:24.357 --> 10:26.359
and it tracks how many
calories I burn.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.696
And you can't ruin
fitness trackers

10:28.696 --> 10:31.464
because I can see
you're wearing a Fitbit.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.333
Oh, no, this is
my Factbit.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.368
Every time I say a fact,
I get a point.

10:35.368 --> 10:36.870
And while fitness
trackers are pretty good

10:36.870 --> 10:39.239
at counting steps,
they've been found
to overestimate

10:39.239 --> 10:41.041
the number of calories
burned in a workout

10:41.041 --> 10:42.676
by up 40%.

10:42.676 --> 10:43.877
(Factbit)
Correct.

10:43.877 --> 10:46.046
Oh!
What? Why would
they overestimate?

10:46.046 --> 10:48.982
Because it's flattering.
Correct, correct, correct.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.918
Oh, man, I am
killing it today.

10:50.918 --> 10:54.187
But I thought these were
scientific medical devices.
Nope.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.023
The company Fitbit
has actually said

10:56.023 --> 10:57.725
their products
"are not intended

10:57.725 --> 10:59.827
to be scientific
or medical devices."

10:59.827 --> 11:01.228
Fitness trackers
are basically

11:01.228 --> 11:02.830
for entertainment
purposes only,

11:02.830 --> 11:05.098
not solid data.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.433
Ahh.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.435
** (melancholy music playing)

11:08.435 --> 11:10.437
(sighs)
I don't believe this.

11:10.437 --> 11:13.240
Counting calories was
supposed to be simple.

11:13.240 --> 11:16.376
Yeah, that's problem.
We think it's simple.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.746
But when your food
label's off by 20%,

11:18.746 --> 11:21.014
your fitness tracker's
off by 40%,

11:21.014 --> 11:22.950
and your body's so complex
that you have no idea

11:22.950 --> 11:25.753
how many you actually need,
well, you can think

11:25.753 --> 11:27.921
you got all the math right
and still gain weight.

11:27.921 --> 11:30.590
(buzzer)
Oh, no, my equation.

11:30.590 --> 11:31.859
(fitness tracker beeping)

11:31.859 --> 11:33.794
Sorry, Sam, it's true.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.028
Sam, this is
Marion Nestle,

11:35.028 --> 11:37.097
a professor of
nutrition at NYU,

11:37.097 --> 11:39.466
and she literally wrote
the book on calories.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.769
So here's the problem
with calories.

11:41.769 --> 11:44.471
They're just almost
impossible to estimate.

11:44.471 --> 11:47.440
You can't see them,
taste them, feel them.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.743
You have no idea
how many are in food,

11:49.743 --> 11:52.112
and people
of very similar

11:52.112 --> 11:54.447
size, height,
weight, and gender

11:54.447 --> 11:56.950
may need very different
number of calories,

11:56.950 --> 11:58.485
depending on how active
they are

11:58.485 --> 12:00.653
and what their basal
metabolic rate is.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.655
But if-- if I can't
count calories,

12:02.655 --> 12:04.124
what else am I
supposed to do?

12:04.124 --> 12:06.493
You don't have to
count calories!

12:06.493 --> 12:10.831
That one number isn't
going to take care of
all of your problems.

12:10.831 --> 12:13.767
You're much better off
cutting down on portion size

12:13.767 --> 12:15.769
or weighing yourself.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.670
The best thing
you can do for yourself

12:17.670 --> 12:19.339
is to eat healthfully.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.274
Thanks,
Professor Nestle.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.110
But I don't want to
eat healthy!

12:23.110 --> 12:25.012
That'll take forever!

12:25.012 --> 12:27.014
I want to
lose weight now.

12:27.014 --> 12:29.149
Like the people
on "Fatty Melt."

12:29.149 --> 12:30.683
If you insist.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.922
(insects buzzing)

12:34.922 --> 12:36.456
Right this way.

12:36.456 --> 12:37.991
Uh...

12:37.991 --> 12:40.660
You want to be
on "Fatty Melt" or not?

12:40.660 --> 12:42.529
(whoosh)

12:42.529 --> 12:43.530
Okay.

12:44.998 --> 12:47.200
(fitness machines
clanking)

12:47.200 --> 12:50.170
** (inspiring music playing)

12:56.844 --> 12:58.711
I am in body heaven!

12:58.711 --> 13:00.713
(animal roars)
More like body hell!

13:00.713 --> 13:03.616
Now drop and give me
50, butterball!

13:03.616 --> 13:04.852
Unh!

13:04.852 --> 13:07.821
And find out why
shows like this
are full of it.

13:07.821 --> 13:09.156
(groans)

13:11.892 --> 13:14.361
(announcer)
Previous on "Fatty Melt,"

13:14.361 --> 13:17.230
we met Sam, a man
who thinks intense exercise

13:17.230 --> 13:18.531
will help him lose weight

13:18.531 --> 13:21.234
for a high school
reunion pool party,

13:21.234 --> 13:22.970
whatever that is.

13:22.970 --> 13:25.873
But Mandy Powers wasn't
going to go easy on him.

13:25.873 --> 13:27.640
Come on, remember,
there's no body types!

13:27.640 --> 13:30.043
There's only fat losers
and thin winners.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.678
Agh!

13:31.678 --> 13:32.712
(announcer)
But after Sam failed

13:32.712 --> 13:34.481
the Supermodel
Wheelbarrow Derby,

13:34.481 --> 13:36.749
Mandy doubted
his commitment.

13:36.749 --> 13:39.319
No, get back up!
Come on!

13:39.319 --> 13:41.054
You want to be happy,
or you want to be skinny?

13:41.054 --> 13:43.523
Skinny.
Yeah!

13:43.523 --> 13:45.358
Well, get ready
to be neither,

13:45.358 --> 13:48.195
because the ultra-intense
diet and exercise programs

13:48.195 --> 13:51.231
you see on TV actually
make it almost impossible

13:51.231 --> 13:52.900
to keep the weight off.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.234
And cut!
(bell rings)

13:54.234 --> 13:56.703
Great job, everyone.
Let's take five.
Thank you.

13:56.703 --> 13:57.905
Hey, sorry, buddy,

13:57.905 --> 13:59.907
but we're all full up
on fatties this season.

13:59.907 --> 14:02.242
Time out.
I've been pushing
models all day.

14:02.242 --> 14:03.743
What do you mean
I won't lose weight?

14:03.743 --> 14:05.545
Uh, of course
you will, stupid!

14:05.545 --> 14:07.580
Just look at Erica,
our season leader.

14:07.580 --> 14:10.617
** (suspenseful music playing)

14:10.617 --> 14:12.752
(dramatic music playing)

14:12.752 --> 14:14.587
You can't fake
results like that.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.423
Actually, you can.

14:16.423 --> 14:18.926
Contestants on weight-loss
shows like "The Biggest Loser"

14:18.926 --> 14:21.461
have reported being told
to gain extra weight

14:21.461 --> 14:23.730
before going on camera
in order to make

14:23.730 --> 14:26.599
their transformations
more dramatic.

14:26.599 --> 14:29.102
Someone is not
a "before" photo yet.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.603
(Sam)
Holy crow!

14:30.603 --> 14:31.771
That is evil!

14:31.771 --> 14:33.606
Even worse, some contestants
have reported

14:33.606 --> 14:36.409
being pressured by the show
to dehydrate themselves

14:36.409 --> 14:38.778
just to shave off
a few extra pounds.

14:38.778 --> 14:41.114
So thirsty!

14:41.114 --> 14:44.117
Ah! Nothing hydrates
as good as thin feels.

14:44.117 --> 14:46.553
(breathing heavily)

14:46.553 --> 14:49.422
Erica's gonna look
so hot!

14:49.422 --> 14:51.158
But that's
so unhealthy!

14:51.158 --> 14:54.494
Wait. You're telling me
it's all lies?

14:54.494 --> 14:55.996
I mean, I bought
the "Fatty Melt" book,

14:55.996 --> 14:58.065
and DVD and Blu-ray
for higher video quality,

14:58.065 --> 14:59.799
and the phone app
and the video game,

14:59.799 --> 15:00.800
and none of it
was real?!

15:00.800 --> 15:02.502
Okay, a little
Hollywood magic

15:02.502 --> 15:04.571
just makes the story
more inspiring, okay?

15:04.571 --> 15:05.672
People eat it up.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.975
Hey, don't eat that up!
(Sam gasps)

15:07.975 --> 15:10.010
And contestants on our show
really do lose weight.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.578
You know what?

15:11.578 --> 15:12.645
Take a look at this
artist's rendering

15:12.645 --> 15:14.481
of what you
could look like.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.449
Huh? Inspired yet?

15:16.449 --> 15:19.987
Well, now,
that is... sexy.

15:19.987 --> 15:21.521
Yeah, I want to
look like that.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.923
Unfortunately,
it probably won't last.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.692
In a few years, you could
actually end up looking

15:25.692 --> 15:27.860
more or less
like you did before.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.362
Why?
Who are you?

15:29.362 --> 15:31.364
Oh, this is Dr. Kevin Hall.

15:31.364 --> 15:32.765
He's an expert
on metabolism

15:32.765 --> 15:34.101
at the National
Institutes of Health,

15:34.101 --> 15:36.003
and he conducted
a six-year study

15:36.003 --> 15:38.038
of contestants
on "The Bigger Loser."

15:38.038 --> 15:39.672
Hey, Sam,
while I can't speak

15:39.672 --> 15:41.208
to how they produce
these shows,

15:41.208 --> 15:43.510
what I can tell you is
that of the 14 contestants

15:43.510 --> 15:45.545
that we studied,
80% of them

15:45.545 --> 15:47.314
regained most of the weight
that they'd lost.

15:47.314 --> 15:49.549
But why?
I don't understand.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.784
When you work out,
you shed pounds.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.854
When you go on one
of these extreme diet
and exercise programs,

15:54.854 --> 15:57.490
your body doesn't
have enough food
energy available,

15:57.490 --> 15:58.825
so it does burn
body fat.

15:58.825 --> 16:02.362
Right!
Very thin-spiring.

16:02.362 --> 16:05.032
Unfortunately, the body
soon lowers its metabolism

16:05.032 --> 16:06.899
to offset
that energy deficit.

16:06.899 --> 16:08.335
And that means
that you'd have to keep

16:08.335 --> 16:11.171
exercising and dieting
at this extreme rate

16:11.171 --> 16:12.972
just to maintain
the weight-loss.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.507
But on the show
we work out, like,

16:14.507 --> 16:16.343
18 hours a day
and eat nothing.

16:16.343 --> 16:18.411
I can't keep that up.
That's impossible.

16:18.411 --> 16:19.479
Exactly.

16:19.479 --> 16:20.580
That's why most
of the contestants

16:20.580 --> 16:21.881
we studied
regained the weight.

16:24.051 --> 16:25.685
Aah! Okay, all right!

16:25.685 --> 16:28.321
I'll work
out this hard forever.

16:28.321 --> 16:29.922
Then will I stay thin?

16:29.922 --> 16:31.224
Not necessarily.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.160
One of our most surprising
findings of our study

16:33.160 --> 16:34.861
was that "The Biggest
Loser" contestants

16:34.861 --> 16:36.229
had slowed their metabolism

16:36.229 --> 16:37.930
by several hundred
calories per day,

16:37.930 --> 16:39.899
and that's
even after they
regained the weight.

16:39.899 --> 16:42.202
So you're telling me
that losing weight faster

16:42.202 --> 16:43.936
could make it harder
for me to stay thin?

16:43.936 --> 16:45.905
I'm afraid so.

16:45.905 --> 16:48.075
But Mandy said that
willpower was the key.

16:48.075 --> 16:49.776
Sam, if anyone
had willpower,

16:49.776 --> 16:51.178
it was the people
that I studied,

16:51.178 --> 16:53.746
and they showed that willpower
alone isn't enough.

16:53.746 --> 16:55.748
In fact, research has shown
that genetics explains

16:55.748 --> 16:58.085
most of the weight differences
between people.

16:58.085 --> 17:00.053
So, as much as we
all want to be thin,

17:00.053 --> 17:01.921
we have to accept that
that might not be

17:01.921 --> 17:04.924
an achievable or realistic
goal for many of us.

17:04.924 --> 17:06.259
Now, who wants some fruit?

17:06.259 --> 17:07.560
(excited chatter)

17:07.560 --> 17:08.961
Bye, Dr. Hall!

17:08.961 --> 17:10.297
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, hey!

17:10.297 --> 17:12.132
What's goin' on here?
Lunch is over!

17:12.132 --> 17:13.933
No, back to work.

17:13.933 --> 17:16.603
So losing weight
is impossible.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.037
It's not impossible,

17:18.037 --> 17:20.973
it's just a lot less
likely than we think.

17:20.973 --> 17:24.944
Once study found
that only 1% of people
who tried to lose weight

17:24.944 --> 17:26.646
were able
to keep it off.

17:26.646 --> 17:29.616
The rest either couldn't
lose it or gained it back.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.118
And that's okay.

17:31.118 --> 17:33.286
It's just how
our bodies work.

17:33.286 --> 17:35.388
But what's not okay
is when we're cruel

17:35.388 --> 17:37.324
to each other or ourselves

17:37.324 --> 17:39.792
because we demand
these massive changes

17:39.792 --> 17:43.330
that might not even
be possible.

17:43.330 --> 17:45.498
Look, I know
that's hard to hear,

17:45.498 --> 17:47.467
but there are still
steps you can take--

17:47.467 --> 17:49.102
Aah! No!

17:49.102 --> 17:52.839
Uhh! I just don't
wanna be fat anymore!

17:52.839 --> 17:54.574
**

17:54.574 --> 17:57.076
It's useless.
I might as well just give up

17:57.076 --> 17:59.146
and go to the high school
reunion pool party now.

17:59.146 --> 18:01.348
Oh, that's a great idea!

18:01.348 --> 18:02.349
(whoosh)

18:02.349 --> 18:03.983
** (dramatic music)

18:03.983 --> 18:04.951
Oh, no!

18:08.020 --> 18:09.656
(singers)
* Marcy

18:09.656 --> 18:11.591
Shh, not now,
doo-wop group!

18:11.591 --> 18:13.426
**

18:13.426 --> 18:16.163
Wait! Don't you wanna
hear my positive takeaway?

18:18.331 --> 18:21.834
**

18:21.834 --> 18:25.438
Hey, guys, I'm here on
the "Adam Ruins Everything"
set with Dr. Kevin Hall

18:25.438 --> 18:27.507
'cause I got a couple more
questions about his work.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.676
So, the study was done
in collaboration with
"The Biggest Loser"?

18:29.676 --> 18:32.044
The first study was,
while they were still
losing the weight.

18:32.044 --> 18:34.013
We did the follow-up study

18:34.013 --> 18:35.515
because they
weren't interested

18:35.515 --> 18:38.017
in participating
in the follow-up study.

18:38.017 --> 18:41.188
Maybe for obvious reasons,
now, retrospectively.

18:41.188 --> 18:44.391
Uh, this issue
of their metabolism
slowing down in some way,

18:44.391 --> 18:46.459
uh, can you expand
on that at all?

18:46.459 --> 18:48.361
One of the main things
that we were interested in

18:48.361 --> 18:49.996
when we were studying
these folks originally

18:49.996 --> 18:53.333
was whether or not
the slowing of metabolism

18:53.333 --> 18:55.968
helps prevent weight loss.
Mm-hmm.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.070
In particular, a lot
of the fitness magazines

18:58.070 --> 18:59.038
that you read about
will say,

18:59.038 --> 19:00.207
if you do enough exercise,

19:00.207 --> 19:01.841
you'll prevent the slowing
of metabolism,

19:01.841 --> 19:02.875
'cause you'll burn--

19:02.875 --> 19:04.544
you'll keep
your muscles larger

19:04.544 --> 19:05.678
and you'll burn
more calories.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.647
Yeah, I've heard that.
Um, that's wrong.

19:07.647 --> 19:08.715
Really?
(chuckling)
Yeah.

19:08.715 --> 19:10.250
So what we found is,
clearly, these folks

19:10.250 --> 19:12.219
were doing tons
of physical activity.

19:12.219 --> 19:13.420
Lots of resistance training.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.755
They actually did increase
their muscle mass.

19:15.755 --> 19:18.191
But they had this plunge
in metabolic rate

19:18.191 --> 19:20.727
of about 600 calories
per day, on average.

19:20.727 --> 19:22.862
Wow.
But the interesting
thing was is that

19:22.862 --> 19:24.231
that didn't
prevent the weight loss.

19:24.231 --> 19:26.199
In fact, the people
who lost the most weight

19:26.199 --> 19:28.901
were the ones who had the most
slowing of metabolism.

19:28.901 --> 19:30.770
So you had some people
gain some weight back,

19:30.770 --> 19:31.871
some people gain
a lot of weight back,

19:31.871 --> 19:34.173
and then one person
actually...

19:34.173 --> 19:35.608
Kept going.
Kept going.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.744
And so do you have any idea
what the difference was

19:37.744 --> 19:39.746
with that one person,
what their--

19:39.746 --> 19:41.248
what the secret is or...

19:41.248 --> 19:44.684
She among the most active
people on that program that--

19:44.684 --> 19:46.919
uh, continuing to this day.

19:46.919 --> 19:49.088
In fact,
the people who continue
to exercise the most

19:49.088 --> 19:51.358
are the ones who keep
the weight off the best.

19:51.358 --> 19:52.759
So what do you say
to people that say,

19:52.759 --> 19:54.126
"Oh, the only reason they
gained all that weight back

19:54.126 --> 19:55.428
"was, oh, they were
on the wrong diet.

19:55.428 --> 19:57.297
"They should, uh,
do my special diet.

19:57.297 --> 19:59.432
"They should do the low-carb
or the low-protein

19:59.432 --> 20:01.601
"or the low, you know,
whatever it is.

20:01.601 --> 20:03.102
Uh, low-Vitamin C diet."
Right, right.

20:03.102 --> 20:04.471
And that would have
solved all their problems.

20:04.471 --> 20:06.072
Yeah, I know,
it's a great question,

20:06.072 --> 20:08.775
because there's a lot of people
who've made those exact claims.

20:08.775 --> 20:11.210
Yeah.
Not the Vitamin C diet,
but...

20:11.210 --> 20:12.912
Someone's gonna come--
someone's gonna come around

20:12.912 --> 20:14.281
and say,
"Cut out Vitamin C."

20:14.281 --> 20:16.215
No, they will,
you're right, um...

20:16.215 --> 20:18.117
First of all, these
"Biggest Loser" folks,

20:18.117 --> 20:19.552
if you think that
they haven't tried

20:19.552 --> 20:21.954
every diet under the sun,
you're delusional, right?

20:21.954 --> 20:23.756
They've tried everything.
Yeah.

20:23.756 --> 20:25.925
And nothing is working
to kind of just keep

20:25.925 --> 20:27.394
that very low body weight.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.762
Our research has shown that
when you bring people in

20:29.762 --> 20:31.631
and you monitor
everything that they eat

20:31.631 --> 20:33.165
and control every morsel

20:33.165 --> 20:35.768
and match for calories
in the diet

20:35.768 --> 20:39.972
that lower carb diets
actually don't offer
any sort of advantages...

20:39.972 --> 20:41.641
Really?
...than lower fat diets.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.810
Now, they might be easier
to stick to for some people,

20:43.810 --> 20:45.478
and some people
might find them

20:45.478 --> 20:47.814
a lot easier to maintain
over the long term,

20:47.814 --> 20:49.582
um, but others don't.

20:49.582 --> 20:53.019
And, on average, there's
really no great benefit.

20:53.019 --> 20:54.421
But I know people
in my life who say,

20:54.421 --> 20:56.856
"Oh, I'm paleo, I'm low-carb,
and it worked for me."

20:56.856 --> 20:58.157
You know, there's
always that person,

20:58.157 --> 20:59.859
"I'm trying the diet
and nothing's happening,

20:59.859 --> 21:01.861
but my friend is doing it
and it's working great for him."

21:01.861 --> 21:03.863
Uh, uh, how do we
explain that?

21:03.863 --> 21:06.165
Um, one of the questions
for those folks is,

21:06.165 --> 21:07.834
"Well, how long have you
been doing it?"

21:07.834 --> 21:09.201
And typically,
the answer is,

21:09.201 --> 21:10.937
"Well, I've, you know,
been doing it a few weeks."

21:10.937 --> 21:13.005
Or maybe, at most,
a few months.

21:13.005 --> 21:16.008
The real test
is what happens after,
you know, a couple years.

21:16.008 --> 21:18.511
And we know that if you
randomize people

21:18.511 --> 21:20.146
to two different diets,
for example,

21:20.146 --> 21:21.514
Diet "A," Diet "B."

21:21.514 --> 21:23.850
There are some people
who are hugely successful

21:23.850 --> 21:25.718
on Diet "A,"
and there are some people

21:25.718 --> 21:27.854
who are hugely successful
on Diet "B."

21:27.854 --> 21:30.222
And there's complete failures
on both of those diets.

21:30.222 --> 21:32.024
Huh.
You should try
to make changes

21:32.024 --> 21:33.960
in your diet
and your physical activity

21:33.960 --> 21:36.195
or exercise patterns
that are persistent,

21:36.195 --> 21:38.130
and they don't change
that much over time.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.032
Because it's the persistence
that's key.

21:40.032 --> 21:42.469
That's what's gonna
drive long-term health.

21:42.469 --> 21:44.136
Well, thank you again so much
for coming on the show

21:44.136 --> 21:45.405
to talk to us
about this, Kevin.

21:45.405 --> 21:46.205
Ah, my pleasure.

21:49.676 --> 21:50.677
**

21:50.677 --> 21:51.878
I can't believe
you brought me

21:51.878 --> 21:53.413
to my high school reunion
pool party.

21:53.413 --> 21:54.647
Look at me!

21:54.647 --> 21:55.748
I'm still fat.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.817
That's not what matters.
Listen...

21:57.817 --> 21:59.386
(gasps)
There's Marcy Leonardo.

21:59.386 --> 22:01.988
(singers)
* Talk to her

22:01.988 --> 22:03.255
I can't, doo-wop group.

22:03.255 --> 22:05.157
I gotta get home and work out
for like ten more years

22:05.157 --> 22:07.394
and possibly get lipo.

22:07.394 --> 22:08.595
Oh, my gosh, Sam?

22:08.595 --> 22:09.929
(gasping)

22:09.929 --> 22:11.263
I'm so glad you're here!

22:11.263 --> 22:12.331
How's everything?

22:12.331 --> 22:14.567
Good. Bad.
Sorry I'm fat.

22:14.567 --> 22:15.902
It just--
What?

22:15.902 --> 22:18.237
Sam, you look great.

22:18.237 --> 22:21.574
Look, this stupid pool party
has everybody freaking out.

22:21.574 --> 22:23.876
I've been trying
to lose weight forever.

22:23.876 --> 22:25.578
But every ad you see
is always like,

22:25.578 --> 22:28.247
"Oh, be thin.
Why aren't you thin yet?"

22:28.247 --> 22:29.248
It's ridiculous.

22:29.248 --> 22:30.583
Thank you, Marcy!

22:30.583 --> 22:32.785
That's exactly the point
that I was trying to make.

22:32.785 --> 22:34.086
Sam, who's your friend?

22:34.086 --> 22:35.688
Hi, I'm Adam Conover.

22:35.688 --> 22:36.789
And this is "Adam--"

22:36.789 --> 22:38.525
His first time
in public,

22:38.525 --> 22:40.126
and he really should
get going.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.595
Sam, Marcy is right.

22:42.595 --> 22:45.131
The amount of stress we put
on this one little number

22:45.131 --> 22:46.866
is totally
out of proportion.

22:46.866 --> 22:49.436
Did you know weight isn't even
directly connected to health?

22:49.436 --> 22:51.938
Oh, yeah! I read that
one UCLA study

22:51.938 --> 22:53.573
found that
50 million Americans

22:53.573 --> 22:55.408
who are classified as
obese or overweight

22:55.408 --> 22:57.076
are actually
perfectly healthy.

22:57.076 --> 23:00.112
So, what, I should
just stop eating healthy
and working out?

23:00.112 --> 23:01.748
No, keep it up.

23:01.748 --> 23:02.782
But don't
do those things

23:02.782 --> 23:04.417
because they'll make you
lose weight.

23:04.417 --> 23:07.420
Do them because they'll
make you look and feel better.

23:07.420 --> 23:10.423
Look, I don't have
a perfect body, either,

23:10.423 --> 23:12.625
but I used to hate myself
for it.

23:12.625 --> 23:15.628
I would stay inside, watching
old Carl Sagan documentaries,

23:15.628 --> 23:17.897
and eating Snack Whales
all day.

23:17.897 --> 23:20.166
Until one day I decided,
"Enough is enough.

23:20.166 --> 23:22.001
"I'm gonna start eating
a little better

23:22.001 --> 23:24.904
and exercising
a little more every day."

23:24.904 --> 23:26.739
And, no, I didn't
lose a ton of weight,

23:26.739 --> 23:29.642
but my skin got better,
my confidence improved.

23:29.642 --> 23:32.344
Heck, it was an overall
life upgrade!

23:32.344 --> 23:35.081
The point is, if you
can make small changes

23:35.081 --> 23:37.416
towards a more active
and healthy lifestyle,

23:37.416 --> 23:40.453
that's great and something
to be proud of.

23:40.453 --> 23:42.689
But it's such a shame
that we let our obsession

23:42.689 --> 23:44.356
with this one number

23:44.356 --> 23:47.627
make all of us feel like crap
about ourselves.

23:47.627 --> 23:50.029
Is that why no one's
getting in the pool?

23:50.029 --> 23:53.332
Yeah, everyone here
feels bad about their body.

23:53.332 --> 23:54.333
You're right.

23:54.333 --> 23:55.502
What we've been
doing to ourselves,

23:55.502 --> 23:57.169
it's so cruel.

23:57.169 --> 23:59.038
They should
be having fun.

23:59.038 --> 24:00.507
We should be having fun.

24:00.507 --> 24:02.374
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking, Sam?

24:04.777 --> 24:06.278
(Sam chuckles)

24:06.278 --> 24:07.514
(splash splash)

24:07.514 --> 24:10.016
You know, I think an episode
of "Doug" ended this way.

24:10.016 --> 24:11.183
** (upbeat music)

24:11.183 --> 24:13.853
Oh, hey, you guys wanna know
how sausages are made?

24:13.853 --> 24:16.523
It's real gross.
Let me tell you about it.

24:16.523 --> 24:18.024
(guests cheering)

24:18.024 --> 24:19.859
Just like actual high school.

24:22.328 --> 24:24.130
**

24:24.130 --> 24:28.501
Aww, I'll never be swoll enough
to win back my wife.

24:28.501 --> 24:30.136
I miss you, Diana.

24:30.136 --> 24:33.205
I hope Todd breaches for you,
like I used to.

24:33.205 --> 24:36.208
I hope Todd
gives her life "porpoise."

24:36.208 --> 24:37.810
(sobbing)
