WEBVTT

00:02.684 --> 00:06.340
Shuri, it is T'Challa.
I am in position.

00:06.477 --> 00:08.007
<i>Don't sound too excited.</i>

00:08.093 --> 00:10.946
<i>You're only about to break into the
most impenetrable kingdom in the world.</i>

00:11.033 --> 00:13.256
Wakanda is
the most impenetrable.

00:13.343 --> 00:15.113
<i>You know what I mean.</i>

00:16.196 --> 00:19.359
Tiger Shark attacked New York
just to obtain the golden relic.

00:19.446 --> 00:21.894
<i>With the royal seal on it.
 Do you think Father knew about it?</i>

00:21.981 --> 00:24.920
<i>It looks quite old. And why hide
it in a hundred-year-old vase?</i>

00:25.007 --> 00:27.409
<i>I wonder if there are more of these
things hidden around the palace.</i>

00:27.496 --> 00:28.874
<i>Do you think Father
kept a lot of secrets?</i>

00:28.961 --> 00:30.235
I do not know.

00:30.322 --> 00:32.337
But Tiger Shark does.

00:33.061 --> 00:34.951
<i>And he's a prisoner of Atlantis,</i>

00:35.038 --> 00:37.333
<i>and Wakanda and Atlantis
are on the brink of war.</i>

00:37.499 --> 00:39.395
<i>Honestly, couldn't you think
of an easier plan?</i>

00:39.482 --> 00:41.381
It is obvious, I could not.

00:41.468 --> 00:43.467
Please try to take
this seriously, Shuri.

00:43.554 --> 00:46.178
<i>I am taking it seriously.
I'm just not being</i>

00:46.265 --> 00:49.123
<i>grim and growly like some
people I might mention.</i>

00:49.210 --> 00:51.334
All right.
I am at the first perimeter.

00:51.421 --> 00:53.800
<i>The first patrol should be
passing you right about now.</i>

00:53.897 --> 00:57.541
<i>After that, be alert for some sort
of camouflage defense system.</i>

01:02.801 --> 01:04.370
I have avoided the patrol.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.368
I see no sign of
mechanical defenses.

01:06.448 --> 01:07.589
<i>Just be careful.</i>

01:07.676 --> 01:08.770
You know me, sister.

01:08.857 --> 01:10.851
I am always... Wait.

01:17.856 --> 01:20.688
Fluoropolymer skin
with an electric core.

01:20.775 --> 01:22.876
<i>Wow. Good luck
getting past that.</i>

01:22.963 --> 01:24.726
Luck is not a factor.

01:25.418 --> 01:28.593
I have passed the mechanical defenses.
Are there more?

01:28.910 --> 01:31.669
<i>Yes. But the intel
is just two words:</i>

01:31.769 --> 01:33.933
<i>"angler" and "decapod."</i>

01:34.020 --> 01:36.385
"Decapod" is another word
for for crustacean.

01:36.846 --> 01:38.494
<i>Any idea what "angler" means?</i>

01:38.581 --> 01:40.843
Yes. I'm afraid I do!

01:45.382 --> 01:48.199

02:07.500 --> 02:09.613
I think I have made you angry.

02:17.415 --> 02:19.127
<i>T'Challa, are you all right?</i>

02:19.214 --> 02:21.851
I am fine.
But when this is over,

02:21.938 --> 02:25.957
remind me to tell you the story
of the one that got away.

02:34.106 --> 02:35.828
Shuri, it is your turn.

02:35.915 --> 02:37.672
<i>All right. I'm going in.</i>

02:37.759 --> 02:39.406
Remember what I said about luck.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.246
<i>I remember everything
you say, brother.</i>

02:41.333 --> 02:43.442
<i>Now let me do my part.</i>

02:59.342 --> 03:02.098
Diplomats, proceed this way.

03:09.649 --> 03:13.254
Action Princess Shuri
to Grumpy Brother T'Challa.

03:15.579 --> 03:19.414
I've passed the first hurdle.
We're all being escorted inside.

03:19.798 --> 03:22.286
<i>What did I say
about taking this seriously?</i>

03:22.373 --> 03:24.616
And what did I say
about trusting me?

03:24.703 --> 03:27.672
<i>It is not about trust.
This mission is delicate.</i>

03:27.759 --> 03:30.077
<i>One wrong move,
and we could start a war.</i>

03:30.164 --> 03:31.773
Relax, brother.

03:31.860 --> 03:34.377
You have your way
of crashing a party,

03:34.464 --> 03:36.369
and I have mine.

03:58.316 --> 04:02.328
Princess Shuri! By the
goddess, this is a surprise.

04:02.433 --> 04:04.127
A delightful surprise.

04:04.214 --> 04:06.496
You grace us with your
presence, Princess.

04:06.583 --> 04:09.894
N'Jadaka! Oh, my!
I haven't seen you in ages.

04:09.981 --> 04:12.644
My apologies. My duties
as Wakanda's ambassador

04:12.731 --> 04:14.892
have kept me away
from court for some time.

04:14.979 --> 04:16.805
But we miss you at home.

04:16.892 --> 04:18.375
You're like family.

04:18.462 --> 04:21.766
All this ceremony,
protocol, politics...

04:21.853 --> 04:24.235
it must be so boring for you.

04:24.322 --> 04:28.282
Yes, at times it can be.
But there are compensations.

04:28.369 --> 04:33.146
May I present to you Her Royal
Highness Shuri, Princess of Wakanda.

04:33.267 --> 04:38.115
Your Highness, may I introduce
Lord Attuma, ruler of Atlantis.

04:39.171 --> 04:40.382
Mm.

04:42.978 --> 04:47.802
Charmed. I bring greetings
from my brother, the king.

04:48.243 --> 04:50.219
Yes, well, welcome.

04:50.306 --> 04:53.982
You have freedom of the palace.
Enjoy the gathering.

04:58.900 --> 05:00.984
I do not think Attuma likes you.

05:01.071 --> 05:03.180
It's my brother he doesn't like.

05:03.267 --> 05:05.657
If you'll excuse me.
I have to mingle.

05:05.744 --> 05:07.498
- Princess duties.
- Of course.

05:10.313 --> 05:12.615
<i>Shuri, I am waiting.</i>

05:13.916 --> 05:15.759
<i>I'm going as fast as I can.</i>

05:15.846 --> 05:17.536
<i>You don't want me
to blow my cover.</i>

05:18.596 --> 05:19.713
What?!

05:22.009 --> 05:24.194
You really should see
the size of the shrimp in here.

05:24.767 --> 05:25.947
Fantastic.

05:26.049 --> 05:28.904
The ones out here
qualify as giant!

05:30.149 --> 05:31.544
Hello!

05:31.697 --> 05:34.040
Hi. Maybe you can help me.

05:34.127 --> 05:37.499
I have this gift from the people of
Wakanda for the people of Atlantis.

05:37.586 --> 05:39.966
Who should I give it to?

05:40.603 --> 05:43.224
Thank you.
You're so sweet.

05:49.439 --> 05:52.812
- <i>Well? Have you done it?</i>
- Give it a moment.

05:52.899 --> 05:55.658
You know, for a panther,
you're not the most patient.

06:17.650 --> 06:18.855
Hmm?

06:20.395 --> 06:22.213
Any time now.

06:23.199 --> 06:24.939
<i>Almost there.</i>

06:25.091 --> 06:26.739
<i>Now!</i>

06:28.444 --> 06:30.987
Well done, Shuri.
I am in.

06:36.741 --> 06:39.302
Ah, right on time.
<i>Shall I join you?</i>

06:39.389 --> 06:42.955
No. Stay with the delegation.
I will begin my search.

06:43.194 --> 06:45.084
Yes, my king.

06:45.171 --> 06:47.854
Why did Father assign
Ambassador N'Jadaka here?

06:47.975 --> 06:51.229
He's quite charming.
Shame we don't see him more.

06:52.218 --> 06:54.580
We all have our duties.

06:55.147 --> 06:57.096
Do you see Attuma?

06:57.866 --> 06:59.683
Oh. Yes.
I see him now.

06:59.770 --> 07:01.106
Should I get closer to him?

07:01.193 --> 07:02.296
<i>No.</i>

07:02.577 --> 07:04.666
Stay clear.
It is safer.

07:06.467 --> 07:08.151
I'm not afraid of him.

07:09.647 --> 07:11.271
Fear is irrelevant.

07:11.358 --> 07:13.395
Caution with Attuma is wise.

07:13.482 --> 07:15.518
Be wise, Shuri.

07:16.218 --> 07:17.689
Hmph!

07:18.155 --> 07:20.568
I appear to have found
a secure cellblock.

07:20.655 --> 07:24.143
- There is also a fairly simple laser grid.
- <i>In the palace?</i>

07:24.272 --> 07:25.943
Tiger Shark must be inside.

07:26.030 --> 07:27.841
I will need to find a way
to disarm it.

07:27.928 --> 07:30.565
<i>Check your belt.
I've left you a gift.</i>

07:31.695 --> 07:36.240
- Marbles?
- <i>Beam refractors. Portable. Stylish.</i>

07:36.327 --> 07:38.494
<i>What no well-dressed superspy
should be without.</i>

07:38.581 --> 07:39.998
I am not a spy.

07:40.085 --> 07:42.716
<i>Spy, infiltrator, angry big
brother bent on revenge...</i>

07:42.803 --> 07:46.240
- <i>it's the same thing.</i>
- I am not angry or bent on...

07:47.333 --> 07:48.744
Never mind.

07:48.912 --> 07:50.582
You are sure they will work?

07:50.669 --> 07:54.082
Doubting me every time
is really not annoying at all.

07:54.169 --> 07:56.205
Just toss them into the grid.

07:58.952 --> 08:00.292
<i>They worked, didn't they?</i>

08:00.379 --> 08:01.381
Indeed, they did.

08:01.468 --> 08:03.260
<i>There are more devices
in your belt.</i>

08:03.366 --> 08:06.033
<i>New prototypes to give you
an edge on missions.</i>

08:06.171 --> 08:08.510
You're not the only genius
in the family.

08:08.606 --> 08:12.465
Now you say, "Thank you for being
a wonderful sister, Shuri."

08:12.552 --> 08:13.949
Yes. Fine. Thank you.

08:14.036 --> 08:16.416
For being wonderful.
Come on. Say it.

08:22.694 --> 08:25.260
You were a fool to come here.

08:25.366 --> 08:27.801
When Attuma catches you...

08:27.888 --> 08:30.482
Attuma is not my concern.

08:30.569 --> 08:32.643
It is time we talked.

08:33.029 --> 08:36.607
Tell me what I want to know,
or when I am done with you,

08:36.693 --> 08:39.067
there will be nothing left
for Attuma!

08:41.038 --> 08:43.511
I haven't come to the bottom
of the ocean to vent.

08:43.599 --> 08:45.223
I have questions.

08:46.749 --> 08:50.204
Funny.
I have one for you.

08:50.365 --> 08:53.406
Do you believe in <i>dragons</i> ?

09:04.004 --> 09:05.830
You'll never win!

09:10.616 --> 09:14.160
Either the dragon'll finish you
or Attuma will.

09:25.951 --> 09:28.207
T'Challa,
what is going on in there?

09:28.294 --> 09:30.658
<i>I may have just
set off an alarm.</i>

09:33.934 --> 09:35.498
Attuma.

09:37.537 --> 09:40.377
Lord Attuma, care to dance?

09:43.256 --> 09:44.917
The Warlord of Atlantis

09:45.004 --> 09:46.381
- does not...
- A first-timer.

09:46.468 --> 09:47.733
Brilliant.

09:48.014 --> 09:49.949
I bet you're a natural.

09:55.779 --> 10:00.193
It is... very much like
battle... attack, parry.

10:00.280 --> 10:02.840
You see?
You lead very well, my lord.

10:02.927 --> 10:05.732
I attribute it to your grace,
Princess.

10:05.819 --> 10:08.419
A warrior has little time
for dancing.

10:08.678 --> 10:10.931
You're too kind, my lord.

10:11.233 --> 10:13.328
Why have you come here?

10:13.415 --> 10:15.583
Surely anything
Wakanda wishes to say

10:15.670 --> 10:17.441
can be said through
your ambassador.

10:17.528 --> 10:19.213
Not everything, my lord.

10:19.315 --> 10:23.574
My brother wishes me to discuss the
Tiger Shark situation personally.

10:23.661 --> 10:25.623
He does, does he?

10:26.021 --> 10:28.250
And what situation is that?

10:50.304 --> 10:51.975
Aah!

10:57.850 --> 11:00.700
How does it feel
to be the hunted?

11:04.116 --> 11:05.662
I would not know.

11:12.456 --> 11:16.304
Now, Tiger Shark,
my questions...

11:18.524 --> 11:21.888
Tiger Shark defied my will
when he attacked the surface.

11:21.975 --> 11:24.979
He is a traitor.
He belongs to Atlantis.

11:25.066 --> 11:26.542
He belongs to me.

11:26.651 --> 11:29.964
Will Wakanda break our treaty
over one criminal?

11:30.194 --> 11:33.086
Wakandans always honor
our agreements.

11:33.209 --> 11:35.417
You can bank on that, my lord.

11:35.531 --> 11:37.802
I believe you believe that,
Princess.

11:37.889 --> 11:40.237
But what of the Black Panther?

11:40.411 --> 11:42.523
My brother is Wakanda.

11:42.610 --> 11:45.142
Your brother is headstrong
and obstinate.

11:46.767 --> 11:50.290
I would say determined
and focused.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.687
Qualities every leader
must possess, no?

11:53.891 --> 11:55.590
I like you, Princess.

11:55.705 --> 11:57.515
You speak plainly and true.

11:57.602 --> 12:01.723
I only wish I had been negotiating with you
instead of your brother all this time.

12:01.810 --> 12:05.278
On that, Lord Attuma, we agree.

12:06.242 --> 12:08.515
Tell me what you know of this.

12:08.820 --> 12:11.058
Do not make me repeat myself.

12:11.866 --> 12:13.233
Talk!

12:15.562 --> 12:17.886
You may imprison me.

12:17.999 --> 12:20.276
They will destroy me.

12:20.367 --> 12:24.332
"They"? Who are "they"?
Speak!

12:24.419 --> 12:27.626
They call themselves
the Council.

12:27.810 --> 12:29.065
The Shadow Council?

12:29.152 --> 12:31.396
Yes. Yes.

12:31.521 --> 12:33.633
The Shadow Council.

12:35.832 --> 12:38.034
Lord Attuma, Princess Shuri.

12:38.121 --> 12:40.723
I'm so glad you two
are hitting it off so well.

12:40.810 --> 12:44.926
Ambassador, you never told me
your Shuri was so delightful.

12:45.083 --> 12:48.336
Our princess is a national
treasure, Lord Attuma.

12:48.489 --> 12:51.871
Well, if you two are just going
to say nice things about me,

12:51.958 --> 12:54.135
the least I can do
is sit here and listen.

12:54.222 --> 12:57.305
<i>The Shadow
Council was defeated, destroyed!</i>

13:00.885 --> 13:02.849
There is a new council!

13:02.936 --> 13:05.610
Who are they?
Where are they? Talk!

13:05.697 --> 13:08.759
I can't!
They will kill me!

13:08.846 --> 13:12.909
I want names. Now, Tiger Shark!

13:13.047 --> 13:16.220
N'Jadaka!
He recruited me.

13:16.307 --> 13:18.232
<i>Ambassador N'Jadaka!</i>

13:18.319 --> 13:20.557
What? No!

13:20.964 --> 13:22.035
N'Jadaka?

13:22.122 --> 13:24.125
My dear, is something wrong?

13:24.212 --> 13:26.291
You!
What have you done?

13:26.378 --> 13:28.025
What are you talking about?

13:28.159 --> 13:31.493
You sold out Wakanda...
to the Shadow Council!

13:31.580 --> 13:34.996
I assure you I do not have the
slightest notion of what you mean.

13:35.083 --> 13:37.904
"Shadow Council"? Where did
you hear something like that?

13:37.991 --> 13:40.725
Traitor!

13:40.872 --> 13:43.414
What is the meaning of this?

13:43.501 --> 13:44.847
Guards!

13:45.645 --> 13:47.602
I have been patient with you.

13:47.689 --> 13:51.961
Now you will tell me everything
you know about the Shadow Council.

13:52.048 --> 13:54.194
- Hmm?
- Black Panther!

13:55.175 --> 13:57.352
Not only
do you break the treaty,

13:57.439 --> 14:00.764
but you dare defile
my personal sanctum?

14:01.807 --> 14:03.232
There is more at work here

14:03.319 --> 14:04.733
than just the two of us.

14:04.820 --> 14:07.382
N'Jadaka is part
of the Shadow Council.

14:07.469 --> 14:11.744
Ambassador N'Jadaka has been a
friend to Atlantis for years.

14:11.831 --> 14:14.639
He and your father
brokered the truce between us.

14:14.726 --> 14:19.037
And now you will break it
to save your wounded pride?

14:19.711 --> 14:21.732
Lord Attuma,
you don't understand...

14:21.819 --> 14:23.521
I understand enough!

14:23.608 --> 14:27.395
Wakandans cannot be trusted
None of you.

14:28.042 --> 14:29.631
You must listen.

14:29.862 --> 14:32.985
The Shadow Council seeks
to dominate everything,

14:33.089 --> 14:35.181
including Atlantis.

14:35.268 --> 14:37.881
Tiger Shark and N'Jadaka
are part of a plot...

14:37.968 --> 14:41.819
Enough! My head is spinning
with all your lies!

14:41.906 --> 14:45.145
Lord Attuma,
let me make this easy for you.

14:45.523 --> 14:47.525
T'Challa speaks the truth.

14:47.757 --> 14:50.729
N'Jadaka, what are you saying?

14:50.888 --> 14:52.955
The Shadow Council is real,

14:53.042 --> 14:55.333
and we will conquer
this whole world,

14:55.420 --> 14:57.781
including your precious oceans.

14:57.872 --> 15:00.398
Our conquest begins now.

15:06.092 --> 15:07.426
No!

15:18.221 --> 15:19.891
It's time to go, Tiger Shark.

15:20.683 --> 15:21.742
Aah!

15:21.822 --> 15:23.364
N'Jadaka!

15:23.989 --> 15:25.935
We'll meet again, T'Challa.

15:26.116 --> 15:28.652
You'll perish first!

15:36.374 --> 15:37.789
Status report!

15:37.876 --> 15:40.360
What has that filthy
air-breather done?

15:40.447 --> 15:43.490
A... A bomb, my lord.
Inside Atlantis.

15:43.577 --> 15:46.625
Damage to every section of the
city, but the worst is here.

15:46.725 --> 15:48.800
What of the diplomats?

15:48.887 --> 15:51.259
Trapped by debris, my lord.

15:52.153 --> 15:54.096
All cadres, fan out!

15:54.183 --> 15:57.706
Find the traitors Tiger Shark
and Ambassador N'Jadaka.

15:57.793 --> 16:00.845
Palace Guard,
evacuate the diplomats.

16:02.201 --> 16:03.863
We can help if you let us.

16:03.950 --> 16:06.994
After all you've done?
Never!

16:07.146 --> 16:09.228
Do not be a fool, Attuma!

16:09.420 --> 16:13.081
You dare, after what
you've done to my city!

16:13.168 --> 16:16.130
What my brother
is trying to say... and failing...

16:16.217 --> 16:18.543
is this is neither the time
nor the place.

16:18.630 --> 16:21.348
- Shuri...
- With respect, my lord,

16:21.435 --> 16:25.290
what matters are the lives of the guests
who are here under your protection.

16:26.939 --> 16:29.646
Your sister is wise, T'Challa.

16:29.733 --> 16:32.611
Perhaps she should rule Wakanda.

16:40.506 --> 16:43.017
Everyone, this way!
Hurry!

16:48.646 --> 16:51.419
Move it! The submarine
waits for no one.

16:51.506 --> 16:53.892
I don't care what kind of heels
you're wearing.

16:59.608 --> 17:01.681
N'Jadaka's bracelet.

17:08.382 --> 17:11.464
The submarine carrying the
delegates is safely away, my lord.

17:11.550 --> 17:14.660
But no sign of the Wakandan
ambassador, nor Tiger Shark.

17:14.747 --> 17:16.021
Worrisome.

17:16.108 --> 17:17.338
Indeed.

17:17.425 --> 17:19.656
<i>T'Challa?
Brother, can you hear me?</i>

17:19.743 --> 17:22.309
Attuma is here too.
Go ahead, Shuri.

17:22.396 --> 17:25.443
<i>I found N'Jadaka's detonator
bracelet in the submarine bay.</i>

17:25.530 --> 17:27.790
Then he must have escaped
Atlantis that way.

17:27.921 --> 17:29.831
<i>That's not all.
The bracelet's circuitry</i>

17:29.918 --> 17:32.039
<i>was made to send
two separate detonation signals...</i>

17:32.126 --> 17:34.432
<i>one immediate, one timed.</i>

17:34.519 --> 17:36.635
There is a second bomb!

17:40.678 --> 17:43.283
My men are searching
as fast as they can.

17:43.419 --> 17:47.533
But without N'Jadaka, we will
never find the bomb in time!

17:49.163 --> 17:50.718
What is that?

17:50.805 --> 17:52.488
One of my sister's inventions.

17:52.575 --> 17:54.701
It scans
for Wakandan technology...

17:54.808 --> 17:57.334
the kind N'Jadaka
would most likely use.

17:57.421 --> 17:59.579
We may be able to scan
for the bomb's location.

18:06.496 --> 18:08.089
We're losing time!

18:08.176 --> 18:09.585
Where is the bomb?

18:11.598 --> 18:13.442
We are close.

18:13.770 --> 18:14.961
There!

18:15.921 --> 18:18.684
No. Wait.

18:20.059 --> 18:21.824
Above us!

18:29.150 --> 18:31.339
We're almost out of time!

18:31.434 --> 18:33.763
I cannot find
an access panel or hatch.

18:33.850 --> 18:36.933
Without a way to open it,
there is no way to stop it!

18:37.201 --> 18:41.315
At this range, a bomb of that
size will vaporize Atlantis.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.286
You are strong,
aren't you, Attuma?

18:43.373 --> 18:45.197
Stronger than most Atlanteans?

18:45.284 --> 18:49.128
- I am stronger than all Atlanteans!
- Good.

18:51.891 --> 18:54.057
My sister created
this Vibranium wrap.

18:54.144 --> 18:56.126
It will muffle the explosion.

18:56.857 --> 18:59.079
Now, Attuma! Quickly!

19:28.851 --> 19:30.728
We have done it.

19:32.858 --> 19:35.064
This changes nothing.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.743
If I lay eyes on you again,

19:37.830 --> 19:41.681
if you dare to enter
my city again,

19:41.943 --> 19:44.759
there will be war.

19:49.514 --> 19:51.199
<i>Financial
markets were down today</i>

19:51.286 --> 19:54.017
<i>over rumor of conflict
between two world powers.</i>

19:54.233 --> 19:55.871
<i>High-ranking sources
have confirmed</i>

19:55.958 --> 19:58.824
<i>escalating tensions
between Atlantis and Wakanda.</i>

19:58.911 --> 20:01.153
<i>With Black Panther
as king of Wakanda,</i>

20:01.240 --> 20:04.330
<i>could the Avengers be drawn
into geopolitical conflict?</i>

20:04.461 --> 20:06.634
<i>There's been no comment
from the Avengers team.</i>

20:06.721 --> 20:09.580
Have you lost your mind?

20:09.803 --> 20:11.810
I do not appreciate your tone.

20:11.897 --> 20:14.214
Hey, I don't appreciate
the president calling me

20:14.301 --> 20:16.980
to ask if you're going around
the world starting wars.

20:17.067 --> 20:18.947
There will be no war.

20:19.631 --> 20:22.502
I do not answer
to your president or to you.

20:25.262 --> 20:29.767
You do realize that what you're doing
is putting the Avengers in a bad spot?

20:31.615 --> 20:33.666
Then I have an easy solution.

20:33.904 --> 20:37.017
Being part of this team conflicts
with my duties as king.

20:37.138 --> 20:38.955
As of this moment...

20:40.944 --> 20:43.986
I am no longer an Avenger.

20:53.983 --> 20:55.689
Was that necessary?

20:56.028 --> 20:57.732
There was no other way.

20:58.061 --> 20:59.916
The Shadow Council has returned.

21:00.003 --> 21:01.916
They must be stopped.

21:02.350 --> 21:05.533
Now there are only two people
on Earth I can trust:

21:05.654 --> 21:07.591
myself and my sister.

21:07.678 --> 21:10.406
And me, Panther.
Whatever you need.

21:10.608 --> 21:14.244
From here on out,
you're a secret Avenger.
