WEBVTT

02:48.730 --> 02:49.399
Sorry.

03:06.814 --> 03:08.616
-Shalom.
-Hi, how are you?

03:08.651 --> 03:09.914
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

03:09.949 --> 03:10.684
Please.

03:25.371 --> 03:27.338
You think you can turn it
down a little bit?

03:27.373 --> 03:28.603
Thank you. Thank you.

03:32.675 --> 03:33.773
Here we go.

03:33.808 --> 03:34.774
Oh, we're here.

03:34.809 --> 03:36.347
-Yeah.
-Great.

03:38.043 --> 03:39.647
Thank you very much
and keep the change.

03:39.682 --> 03:41.418
-Oh wow, thank you.
-You're welcome.

03:52.761 --> 03:54.024
-There you go.
-Thank you.

03:54.059 --> 03:54.959
Enjoy.

04:56.055 --> 04:57.362
Oh, hello.

04:57.826 --> 05:00.695
I'm not sure I have the...
the right place.

05:00.730 --> 05:01.960
This is apartment 6, isn't it?

05:02.534 --> 05:03.599
Yeah...

05:03.832 --> 05:04.798
Oh.

05:05.735 --> 05:06.503
I'm Michael.

05:07.372 --> 05:08.406
I'm...
I'm subletting the apartment.

05:09.739 --> 05:11.101
Yeah.
Yes, no, but that's tomorrow.

05:11.136 --> 05:12.410
You have the wrong day.

05:13.380 --> 05:15.644
No, I don't, I don't think so.

05:17.109 --> 05:17.712
Here.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.046
Okay, so here it says the 8th.

05:22.081 --> 05:23.080
Right.

05:24.016 --> 05:25.522
And that's tomorrow,
tomorrow is the 8th.

05:26.085 --> 05:28.085
No, tomorrow is the 9th.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.053
Today is the 8th.

05:30.155 --> 05:31.825
-Today is the 8th?
-Yeah.

05:32.091 --> 05:34.058
Fuck.
I was sure today's the 7th.

05:34.093 --> 05:36.698
Come. Come, please come in.

05:36.733 --> 05:37.930
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, yeah.

05:37.965 --> 05:39.470
I'm sorry about the mess.

05:39.901 --> 05:40.966
I'm really sorry about the mess,

05:42.102 --> 05:44.607
we were up all night shooting
something for my class

05:44.642 --> 05:45.674
and I didn't sleep for two days
now

05:45.709 --> 05:47.643
so I just forgot what day it is.

05:47.678 --> 05:49.040
I was sure today is the 7th.

05:50.410 --> 05:53.748
Just give me a few minutes
and I will organize everything,
okay?

05:53.783 --> 05:56.685
I will make this place
look good as new.

06:23.978 --> 06:24.878
Excuse me.

06:24.913 --> 06:25.681
Yeah?

06:26.717 --> 06:27.551
Yeah, actually, I...
I think it might be better

06:28.387 --> 06:29.520
if I just book myself into a
hotel.

06:30.456 --> 06:30.950
No! Please, please,
I'm almost finished.

06:31.886 --> 06:32.853
-Five minutes.
-No, no, thank you, but...

06:33.989 --> 06:35.020
I think I'd be better off
if I stayed at a hotel...

06:35.055 --> 06:38.122
Listen, I promise, I...

06:39.092 --> 06:40.795
Sorry, I have to answer, it's
my mom

06:40.830 --> 06:43.435
and she won't stop calling me
if I don't answer, so...

06:55.614 --> 06:57.482
Come. I will show you the house.

06:57.517 --> 06:59.649
There are a lot of things.

07:01.917 --> 07:03.620
Do you really wanna go to a
hotel?

07:03.886 --> 07:06.623
Look around you,
this is like the coolest
neighborhood ever.

07:06.658 --> 07:07.855
You know there was even a...

07:07.890 --> 07:09.857
an article in TimeOut London

07:10.090 --> 07:11.694
about the sexiest neighborhoods
in the world

07:11.729 --> 07:12.728
and guess who won?

07:15.634 --> 07:16.765
Please stay.

07:17.768 --> 07:18.701
I'm sorry about my fuck-up,

07:19.704 --> 07:21.066
but I promise you,
this is a great apartment.

07:21.101 --> 07:22.474
And...

07:23.070 --> 07:25.444
I don't know
how else to say it, but...

07:26.777 --> 07:28.172
I really need the money.

09:13.950 --> 09:15.015
Shit.

11:22.210 --> 11:23.880
-Oh, hi.
-Hi.

11:24.344 --> 11:25.915
Hang on just a second.

11:25.950 --> 11:27.345
I'm just trying to...

11:27.380 --> 11:29.281
Who are you murdering over
there?

11:29.316 --> 11:31.756
Just trying to open a bottle of
wine.

11:31.791 --> 11:32.856
With a knife?

11:32.891 --> 11:34.253
Couldn't find a corkscrew.

11:35.091 --> 11:36.222
There we go.

11:39.194 --> 11:40.292
Tried you earlier,

11:40.800 --> 11:41.425
I was getting worried.

11:42.294 --> 11:44.461
Oh yeah, sorry, my...
my battery died.

11:45.002 --> 11:46.100
Okay.

11:46.135 --> 11:48.168
So how, how was your flight?

11:48.907 --> 11:49.873
Did you get some sleep?

11:49.908 --> 11:50.775
Not much.

11:51.371 --> 11:52.843
Why didn't you take a pill?

11:52.878 --> 11:54.504
I did. Two of them.

11:54.539 --> 11:56.308
-Oh.
-I've gotta get Berger

11:56.343 --> 11:58.310
to give me something stronger
when I get back.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.752
I... thought he did.

12:00.952 --> 12:01.786
I wish he had.

12:02.989 --> 12:04.349
He said he'd think about raising
the dose when I get back.

12:04.956 --> 12:06.021
Okay.

12:06.958 --> 12:08.958
So how's Tel Aviv?

12:08.993 --> 12:10.795
Ah, I haven't seen that much of
it.

12:10.830 --> 12:12.423
It's kind of a strange mixture.

12:12.931 --> 12:14.425
Not sure I can figure it out.

12:14.900 --> 12:18.132
You always say that,
and you always do by the fifth
day.

12:18.167 --> 12:18.935
I guess.

12:19.300 --> 12:20.398
How's the apartment?

12:20.433 --> 12:21.773
The apartment...

12:22.567 --> 12:23.401
It's decent.

12:23.942 --> 12:24.534
Decent?

12:24.569 --> 12:26.008
It's okay, you know.

12:26.571 --> 12:28.439
Well, why...
why don't you show me around?

12:29.211 --> 12:30.881
Ah, let's see...

12:31.246 --> 12:32.344
Here we go.

12:34.117 --> 12:36.348
There's the bathroom,
you don't wanna go in there.

12:38.286 --> 12:39.890
There's my desk.

12:40.123 --> 12:43.355
Very low-hanging chandelier,

12:43.390 --> 12:44.928
something like that.

12:44.963 --> 12:47.799
And here is the living room,

12:47.834 --> 12:48.932
you know, it's pretty standard.

12:49.594 --> 12:52.364
Wait.
What's, what's that on the wall?

12:52.971 --> 12:55.070
That is "Nightmare on Elm
Street."

12:55.105 --> 12:56.808
Oh, part two!

12:57.008 --> 12:58.403
"Freddy's Revenge."

12:58.944 --> 13:01.274
Who hangs movie posters
in their living room?

13:01.309 --> 13:01.978
He's a kid.

13:02.947 --> 13:04.376
I think he's a film student
or something.

13:06.116 --> 13:08.215
Ah, a room with a view.

13:08.514 --> 13:10.217
Wouldn't go that far.

13:10.252 --> 13:11.548
Just the other buildings,

13:11.583 --> 13:14.188
here are the neighbors over
there.

13:18.491 --> 13:20.095
It's too dark to see anything

13:20.130 --> 13:22.262
but it's actually
a pretty cool location.

13:22.902 --> 13:24.165
It was just chosen by
TimeOut London

13:25.501 --> 13:26.367
as one of the sexiest new
neighborhoods
in the world, so...

13:27.368 --> 13:30.369
Well, TimeOut London
makes mistakes too.

13:30.404 --> 13:31.975
You're such a snob.

13:33.374 --> 13:35.374
Here we are back in the kitchen.

13:35.409 --> 13:36.848
Wait, wait...

13:36.883 --> 13:38.245
Go back to the fridge.

13:39.512 --> 13:40.951
Is that the kid?

13:40.986 --> 13:41.578
Zoom in.

13:41.613 --> 13:43.316
Yep, that's him.

13:43.351 --> 13:45.153
Oh my god, he's hot!

13:45.188 --> 13:47.353
Oh, stop.
You could be his dad.

13:47.388 --> 13:48.959
But I'm not.

13:49.962 --> 13:50.994
Is he gay?

13:51.260 --> 13:52.325
I don't know.

13:53.361 --> 13:55.361
Okay, I can see
you're not in the mood.

13:55.396 --> 13:57.198
I'm sorry, I'm just exhausted.

13:57.431 --> 13:59.530
Fine, I understand.

13:59.565 --> 14:00.938
-Go to bed.
-Okay.

14:00.973 --> 14:02.401
-Good night.
-Good night.

14:02.436 --> 14:03.501
And don't forget
to take your pills.

14:03.536 --> 14:05.569
I won't, I won't, don't worry.

14:06.209 --> 14:08.176
-I love you.
-Love you too.

15:16.279 --> 15:17.476
David Tartakover

15:18.712 --> 15:21.051
is best known for his
politically
provocative posters.

15:21.515 --> 15:24.219
His style features
minimalist compositions

15:24.254 --> 15:26.287
that use images
taken from the media,

15:26.322 --> 15:28.124
mixed with slogans and text,

15:28.159 --> 15:30.621
inspired by Russian
Constructivism.

15:31.261 --> 15:32.425
He has said:

15:32.460 --> 15:35.395
"My work is often
considered a protest.

15:35.628 --> 15:37.694
"It's not. It's a reaction.

15:37.729 --> 15:40.103
"You have to go with
the truth all the way.

15:40.138 --> 15:42.501
"Otherwise, what have you
accomplished?"

15:43.603 --> 15:47.209
In one iconic poster,
a little boy with one eye shut,

15:47.244 --> 15:49.013
possibly shot by a soldier,

15:49.048 --> 15:51.708
is juxtaposed with
a child's drawing of a flower

15:52.117 --> 15:52.709
and the words:

15:53.912 --> 15:56.647
"Daddy, what are you doing
in the occupied territories?"

15:58.156 --> 15:59.683
One of his most famous works

15:59.718 --> 16:02.323
was the logo he designed
for the Peace Now Movement

16:02.358 --> 16:03.720
in 1978.

16:05.090 --> 16:09.627
The deceptively simple logo
combines
the words "Peace" and "Now"

16:09.662 --> 16:12.432
and uses no other symbol or
design.

16:13.204 --> 16:17.305
It became the first widely used
political sticker in Israel.

16:19.408 --> 16:22.442
His work began to criticize
the political establishment

16:22.477 --> 16:25.148
even more sharply
after the euphoric...

16:25.546 --> 16:26.413
Hello?

16:26.448 --> 16:28.019
Hi, is this David?

16:28.384 --> 16:30.516
No.
This is his husband, Michael.

16:30.716 --> 16:33.024
Hi, Michael,
it's Suzanne Shrib calling

16:33.059 --> 16:34.685
from the IBS clinic.

16:35.391 --> 16:36.654
Oh, hi, Suzanne.

16:37.857 --> 16:39.393
Actually I have some terrific
news
for you and David.

16:39.428 --> 16:40.295
What's that?

16:41.164 --> 16:42.660
We've located a new surrogate
for you.

16:43.762 --> 16:46.037
I'm sorry,
I'm not sure I understand.

16:46.072 --> 16:48.336
Well, of course we'd like to
set up
an appointment for both of you
to meet her

16:48.371 --> 16:50.272
and give you a chance
to form an impression,

16:50.307 --> 16:51.603
see how you feel.

16:51.638 --> 16:53.704
She's young, very bright,

16:53.739 --> 16:56.443
she's getting an MSW at Rutgers.

16:56.478 --> 16:59.611
Sorry, when was the last time
you spoke with David?

17:00.152 --> 17:02.350
Oh, about a month ago.

17:02.385 --> 17:05.155
I promised I'd give him a call
the moment we had a match.

18:21.398 --> 18:22.529
Oh, hi.

18:23.202 --> 18:25.268
Sorry, I didn't know if you're
awake.

18:25.303 --> 18:26.863
I just wanted to take something
I left here.

18:26.898 --> 18:28.271
Oh, no worries, come on inside.

18:29.374 --> 18:30.405
I'll take it and leave,
it's in my room, one minute.

18:44.454 --> 18:46.619
Sorry, man,
I just had to grab my weed.

18:46.819 --> 18:48.258
Can't really fall asleep
without it.

18:48.293 --> 18:50.260
Yeah, sure, totally get that.

18:50.460 --> 18:51.855
So, you're good?

18:52.264 --> 18:54.198
You're okay?
Need anything from me?

18:54.233 --> 18:56.860
-You want some of this maybe?
-No, no, I'm good, thank you.

18:57.731 --> 18:59.467
Hey, you hungry?

18:59.502 --> 19:02.668
I just bought some breakfast,
you're welcome to join me.

19:05.310 --> 19:07.937
-"Sweetbox"?
-Yeah, according to my research

19:07.972 --> 19:09.543
it's the best bakery in town.

19:10.645 --> 19:11.380
What?

19:12.449 --> 19:13.349
It's funny that someone
has to come from New York

19:14.719 --> 19:16.583
to tell me that the best bakery
in town
is just around the corner.

19:16.849 --> 19:17.749
Are they good?

19:17.784 --> 19:18.915
You're welcome to try one.

19:20.318 --> 19:22.523
To tell you the truth,
I don't really eat anything
before lunch.

19:22.558 --> 19:25.526
My breakfast is just black
coffee
and a cigarette.

19:25.561 --> 19:26.692
Do you mind?
-Actually...

19:30.467 --> 19:31.532
So,

19:32.635 --> 19:34.568
what are you doing in Israel,
if it's okay to ask?

19:34.603 --> 19:36.669
Of course, I'm a travel writer.

19:36.704 --> 19:38.770
I write a column
for The New York Times.

19:38.805 --> 19:41.575
-Really?
-Yeah, it's called "The
Intrepid Traveler."

19:41.610 --> 19:42.642
"Intrepid"?

19:42.677 --> 19:44.446
Intrepid, it means...

19:44.679 --> 19:46.448
I don't know, resourceful?
Brave?

19:46.483 --> 19:47.944
Someone who won't give up,

19:47.979 --> 19:49.715
who's strong in the face of
adversity.

19:50.982 --> 19:52.421
It's just a name though.

19:52.753 --> 19:54.489
So you're not really intrepid?

19:54.755 --> 19:55.886
I try to be.

19:56.790 --> 19:58.658
The idea is to write about
the...

19:58.693 --> 20:00.330
the city as it really is.

20:00.365 --> 20:03.234
The local city,
not the... the touristy version.

20:04.930 --> 20:06.534
It's your first time in Tel
Aviv?

20:06.899 --> 20:08.470
It's actually my second.

20:08.670 --> 20:10.505
I was here for my Bar-Mitzvah.

20:10.804 --> 20:13.673
But that was in Jerusalem
about 100 years ago.

20:14.544 --> 20:16.005
Probably wasn't such a great
visit

20:16.040 --> 20:17.644
if it took you so long to come
back.

20:17.679 --> 20:19.514
You are right about that.

20:19.549 --> 20:21.351
It was kind of a difficult
visit.

20:21.914 --> 20:23.419
My parents were...

20:23.850 --> 20:25.355
They were constantly fighting.

20:26.658 --> 20:28.688
In fact, a couple of months
after that
they were divorced.

20:28.723 --> 20:30.261
-Oh...
-Yeah.

20:31.764 --> 20:32.989
So what did they say when you
told them
that you're coming back here?

20:33.024 --> 20:33.924
Who?

20:34.729 --> 20:36.597
Oh, my parents, oh.

20:36.632 --> 20:38.896
My mom passed away
couple of years ago.

20:38.931 --> 20:39.930
I'm sorry, I have to remember

20:40.866 --> 20:41.833
not to ask people over 50
this question,

20:41.868 --> 20:42.801
I always do that.

20:44.640 --> 20:45.705
It's okay.

20:45.740 --> 20:48.312
My dad is still
very much alive and...

20:48.677 --> 20:51.513
I think he'll be happy
when I tell him I came back.

20:52.780 --> 20:55.253
Well, I hope this time
you'll have a better experience.

20:55.453 --> 20:58.553
-Yeah. -I think Israelis
really try to be nice to
tourists.

20:58.588 --> 21:01.688
Yeah, they wanna feed you,
they wanna tell you stories,

21:01.723 --> 21:02.623
speak English with you

21:03.626 --> 21:04.295
even if they don't know
how to speak English.

21:05.793 --> 21:07.397
They just want you to like them.

21:07.762 --> 21:09.300
Why do you think that is?

21:10.963 --> 21:12.270
I don't know.

21:13.273 --> 21:14.404
Maybe it's because
we are in the Middle East,

21:15.407 --> 21:16.505
but we wanna be treated
like we are in the West.

21:16.540 --> 21:17.407
Wow.

21:17.442 --> 21:18.936
Can I quote you on that?

21:20.445 --> 21:21.543
Are you making fun of me?

21:21.578 --> 21:22.676
'Cause I was only trying to...

21:22.711 --> 21:24.975
No, no, I wasn't.
I meant that.

21:25.010 --> 21:26.042
That was interesting.

21:27.584 --> 21:28.616
Okay.

21:29.553 --> 21:30.783
So what's the plan?

21:32.391 --> 21:34.721
-You have a plan, right?
-Oh, yes, yes.

21:34.756 --> 21:36.657
Not only do I have a plan,

21:36.857 --> 21:38.021
I have a list.

21:38.694 --> 21:40.727
Everything that's highlighted
in yellow,

21:40.762 --> 21:42.696
that's top priority, then...

21:42.731 --> 21:44.060
Neve Tzedek.

21:44.667 --> 21:46.700
Sarona, Manta Ray Beach,

21:46.735 --> 21:47.833
Tel Aviv Museum.

21:47.868 --> 21:49.505
Aren't all those the must-sees?

21:49.705 --> 21:50.935
Yeah, yeah,

21:52.171 --> 21:53.839
if you are a Jewish princess
on her Birthright tour, yeah.

21:54.776 --> 21:57.579
These places are like
the most cliché thing ever.

21:58.813 --> 21:59.515
Florentin?

22:00.518 --> 22:01.979
Yeah, we're not gonna go
to Rothschild Boulevard,

22:02.014 --> 22:03.486
you've been there enough.

22:11.056 --> 22:11.824
What's wrong?

22:12.493 --> 22:13.430
They stole my fucking bike.

22:14.065 --> 22:14.860
Second time in six months.

22:14.895 --> 22:16.026
Alright...

22:16.567 --> 22:18.501
Alright, just calm down.

22:18.866 --> 22:19.898
I'm not sure I follow,

22:21.034 --> 22:22.131
you're saying you actually
know who stole your bike?

22:22.166 --> 22:23.033
Not exactly,

22:24.269 --> 22:25.871
but if I'm lucky they sold it
to the bike shop over there.

22:27.107 --> 22:28.742
Last time those fuckers stole
my bike,
I found it there.

23:17.155 --> 23:19.122
He's lying,
he said it's not my bike.

23:19.157 --> 23:21.597
He wants me to pay 500 shekels
for my bike.

23:21.764 --> 23:23.929
Why don't you just call the
police?
It's your bike.

23:23.964 --> 23:25.634
Forget it, I don't want to do
that.

23:25.669 --> 23:26.536
Why not?

23:27.372 --> 23:28.472
The police in this area are
racists

23:29.741 --> 23:30.903
and the immigrants,
the money they'll have to pay a
lawyer,

23:31.839 --> 23:32.872
they'll have to steal
another 30 bikes.

23:32.907 --> 23:33.774
That's decent of you.

23:34.777 --> 23:35.776
I don't think
I could be that cool about it.

23:36.612 --> 23:37.415
I mean, it is your bike, after
all.

23:38.251 --> 23:38.977
I know, I'm gonna come back
later.

23:39.913 --> 23:41.012
I know this guy's son,
I'll talk to him.

23:49.055 --> 23:50.428
Want some juice?

23:50.727 --> 23:51.693
Sure.

23:53.096 --> 23:54.157
This is the best pomegranate
juice
you're gonna get in Tel Aviv.

23:54.192 --> 23:55.565
Maybe in the world.

24:04.510 --> 24:06.070
Do you have small change maybe?

24:08.679 --> 24:09.513
Thanks.

24:14.520 --> 24:15.882
Oh, you're right, this is good.

24:15.917 --> 24:16.949
I told you.

24:28.600 --> 24:29.995
Thirsty, huh?

24:30.030 --> 24:31.128
Yeah.

24:34.034 --> 24:34.835
You hungry?

24:35.200 --> 24:36.232
A little.

24:37.735 --> 24:39.642
'Cause there's a great
restaurant I know
with really great Israeli food.

24:40.172 --> 24:41.006
Sounds good.

24:41.842 --> 24:43.943
But we'll have to wait till
3:00.

24:44.176 --> 24:45.241
Why?

24:45.276 --> 24:46.715
'Cause they have a Happy Hour.

24:46.750 --> 24:48.486
Yeah, all the food is half
price.

24:48.917 --> 24:51.115
Well, it's two hours from now.

24:51.150 --> 24:52.853
If you're hungry, we can go now.

24:52.888 --> 24:53.689
I'm happy to pay.

24:54.425 --> 24:56.054
No, no.
It's okay, I can wait.

25:42.234 --> 25:45.169
It's our special hummus with
"ful,"
like fava beans.

25:45.204 --> 25:45.906
Sounds good to me.

25:47.679 --> 25:49.580
-So, two hummus with ful.
-Yeah.

25:49.615 --> 25:51.780
One meat soup, one Israeli
salad,

25:51.815 --> 25:53.045
and rice with beans.

25:53.883 --> 25:55.014
-Okay.
-Sounds great.

25:55.049 --> 25:56.246
How about some shots?
On the house?

25:57.623 --> 25:59.282
No, no, I'm great, thank you.

26:00.791 --> 26:01.823
Okay.

26:01.858 --> 26:03.121
You never say no to free shots.

26:03.156 --> 26:04.760
I'm fine with beer,

26:06.063 --> 26:07.928
it's a little early in the day
for me
to start drinking arak.

26:07.963 --> 26:09.633
Don't worry, I'll drink yours.

26:09.965 --> 26:11.030
That's for you.

26:12.099 --> 26:13.230
That's for you.

26:15.069 --> 26:17.234
-L'chaim.
-L'chaim.

26:27.081 --> 26:28.146
So...

26:29.382 --> 26:31.083
Do you write only about travel
or also about other things?

26:31.118 --> 26:32.282
What do you mean?

26:32.317 --> 26:33.052
I googled you.

26:33.721 --> 26:35.054
I saw you wrote a book once,

26:36.157 --> 26:37.925
unless there's another writer
named Michael Green.

26:38.730 --> 26:40.158
"Complications,"

26:40.193 --> 26:42.193
it says it was a "thrilling
debut."

26:42.228 --> 26:45.262
Yes, that was many,
many, many years ago.

26:45.770 --> 26:46.769
What was it about?

26:48.168 --> 26:50.069
It's about the world
I lived in back then.

26:50.709 --> 26:52.742
New York City
in the late '80s, early '90s.

26:53.074 --> 26:55.041
What, like AIDS and stuff like
that?

26:55.340 --> 26:56.174
Well...

26:56.781 --> 26:57.307
That's so depressing,

26:58.410 --> 26:59.782
why does everything
always has to go back to that?

27:00.651 --> 27:02.719
Well, I didn't go back, I was
there.

27:02.754 --> 27:04.721
I sort of wrote the book in
real-time.

27:04.954 --> 27:07.658
My first boyfriend, he...
he died of AIDS.

27:08.727 --> 27:09.693
Fuck.

27:18.330 --> 27:19.362
Enjoy.

27:19.397 --> 27:20.737
Thank you.

27:21.267 --> 27:22.266
Thanks.

27:36.381 --> 27:37.919
Is that not what you ordered?

27:37.954 --> 27:39.888
It is, but I said no onion.

27:39.923 --> 27:40.350
I hate it.

27:41.186 --> 27:42.858
How do you eat food without
onions,

27:42.893 --> 27:44.354
that's what gives it all the
flavor.

27:44.829 --> 27:45.322
Ichs.

27:46.193 --> 27:46.994
What?

27:47.930 --> 27:51.295
Ah, "ichs," it's like Hebrew
for "yuck."

27:51.803 --> 27:52.835
Ah.

27:52.870 --> 27:53.671
Icks.

27:54.135 --> 27:55.970
Not "icks." Ichs.

27:56.940 --> 27:58.104
Ichs.

28:03.276 --> 28:05.749
So, um, what about you, Tomer?

28:06.048 --> 28:08.279
What kind of movies
do you wanna make in the future?

28:08.919 --> 28:10.314
Why in the future?
I'm already making them.

28:10.349 --> 28:11.788
Oh, great.

28:11.823 --> 28:13.053
So, what are they about?

28:13.891 --> 28:15.220
What are they about?

28:16.058 --> 28:18.058
It's hard to explain.

28:18.093 --> 28:20.995
It's kind of "artistic horror,"
I guess,

28:21.030 --> 28:25.131
but I don't wanna,
like, put it in a box, you
know? I...

28:25.166 --> 28:28.035
I wanna make films that will
punch you
in the face, you know?

28:28.070 --> 28:31.170
I'd rather make my audience
vomit
than just being fine with it.

28:32.206 --> 28:35.845
Yeah, I think cinema should
physically shake you up,

28:35.880 --> 28:37.473
like, like a rollercoaster.

28:39.510 --> 28:40.817
Okay.

28:46.484 --> 28:47.890
You have my number
if you need anything.

28:49.059 --> 28:50.288
Yeah. You have everything
you need from the apartment?

28:50.323 --> 28:51.256
Yeah.

28:52.061 --> 28:53.225
Where are you staying?

28:53.997 --> 28:54.829
Last night I went to my mother,

28:54.865 --> 28:57.130
but I don't do it again,
it's too far.

28:57.561 --> 28:59.165
Where will you be tonight?

28:59.563 --> 29:00.804
Not sure.

29:03.006 --> 29:04.808
You know what's the shittiest
thing?

29:06.108 --> 29:07.778
Maybe I forgot to lock them.

29:08.913 --> 29:10.308
I forget sometimes.

29:11.311 --> 29:13.784
So, have fun, yeah?

29:13.819 --> 29:14.950
Enjoy real Tel Aviv.

29:16.316 --> 29:17.414
Wait.

29:18.384 --> 29:20.120
What don't you just
stay here tonight?

29:20.155 --> 29:22.188
Until you figure something out.

29:22.223 --> 29:23.519
Thanks, but it's cool.

29:24.788 --> 29:26.456
I'm used to subletting my place
and crashing at other people's.

29:27.063 --> 29:28.095
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

29:28.130 --> 29:30.295
I mean,
you could stay on the sofa.

29:30.902 --> 29:33.804
Maybe in return you could
continue to be my tour guide.

29:34.202 --> 29:36.807
Keep showing me around the city
like you did today?

29:38.074 --> 29:39.777
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

29:40.945 --> 29:44.309
What if I'm like, a serial
killer?

29:44.344 --> 29:46.344
Or you, you could be a serial
killer.
I mean,

29:47.050 --> 29:48.082
you never know.

30:02.362 --> 30:04.032
It's that one.

30:17.608 --> 30:19.916
So, I could just be here.

30:20.215 --> 30:22.479
And you don't have to worry
about me.

30:22.514 --> 30:23.513
Okay.

32:20.434 --> 32:21.664
Very well done.

32:23.767 --> 32:25.074
Okay.

32:25.274 --> 32:26.504
Anything else?

32:28.376 --> 32:31.608
Horror movies aren't really my
thing,
to be honest. I...

32:32.578 --> 32:35.348
-I don't always understand
-You don't need to understand.

32:35.383 --> 32:37.086
It's... it's what you feel.

32:37.121 --> 32:39.220
It's a physical experience.

32:39.255 --> 32:41.222
Oh, so, it's not meant to be
scary?

32:41.257 --> 32:42.718
It's not meant to be anything,

32:43.160 --> 32:44.720
it's what you bring to it,
it's...

32:45.195 --> 32:46.359
it's what you see.

32:46.790 --> 32:48.427
Oh, interesting.

32:50.365 --> 32:51.694
"Interesting..."

32:51.729 --> 32:52.398
What?

32:53.033 --> 32:54.169
You're probably into what?

32:54.204 --> 32:56.171
Romantic comedies, musicals?

32:56.635 --> 32:57.568
Is that a crime?

32:57.603 --> 32:58.536
No,

32:59.805 --> 33:01.671
but it's very unoriginal to be
a gay man who loves musicals.

33:03.107 --> 33:04.542
What, do you have like a poster
of Liza Minnelli in your living
room?

33:07.052 --> 33:08.282
What's wrong with musicals?

33:08.812 --> 33:11.318
Nothing, and that's the problem.

33:11.353 --> 33:13.683
Everyone is so happy and so gay.

33:13.718 --> 33:14.618
And what's wrong with that?

33:15.754 --> 33:17.555
It's not a question of wrong,
it's a question of...

33:18.162 --> 33:20.426
Not all of us like cheesy
romance
and happy endings.

33:25.664 --> 33:26.432
Tomer!

33:33.144 --> 33:35.111
Michael, Daria. Daria, Michael.

33:35.146 --> 33:37.113
Hey, it's nice to meet you.

33:38.380 --> 33:40.149
We just saw you in Tomer's film,

33:40.448 --> 33:41.282
you were very good.

33:42.118 --> 33:42.481
Don't believe him, he didn't
like it.

33:43.385 --> 33:44.384
I did.

33:45.816 --> 33:47.156
You're welcome to come in.

33:56.827 --> 33:58.695
Daria and her boyfriend Amir
had a fight.

33:58.730 --> 34:00.301
We didn't fight, we broke up.

34:00.336 --> 34:02.105
Don't worry,
this happens every two weeks.

34:02.140 --> 34:04.437
I think they do it just to have
a lot of make-up sex.

34:04.472 --> 34:06.109
This time it's different, Tomer.

34:06.144 --> 34:08.342
-What did he do this time?
-What did he do?

34:08.377 --> 34:11.147
Well, right in the middle of
rehearsal
he stops everything

34:11.182 --> 34:12.346
and says I'm ruining the dance.

34:12.381 --> 34:12.775
Me?

34:13.477 --> 34:14.645
He cursed me in fucking Arabic

34:15.881 --> 34:17.054
and it wasn't about anything
that happened in the rehearsal,

34:18.424 --> 34:20.585
it was all about something I
said
about his family a few days ago.

34:20.620 --> 34:22.191
What did you say
about his family?

34:22.226 --> 34:23.753
That maybe he shouldn't invite
them.

34:23.788 --> 34:25.392
That maybe it's not for them,

34:25.427 --> 34:26.822
maybe it's too provocative.

34:27.891 --> 34:30.067
I didn't say it
in a racist way, you know?

34:30.234 --> 34:31.827
In what?

34:31.862 --> 34:33.136
-Racist way!
-Oh.

34:34.339 --> 34:36.106
Fuck, I don't know
if I want my parents to come
either.

34:36.141 --> 34:38.339
Daria and Amir have a dance show
that opens tomorrow.

34:38.374 --> 34:40.671
Oh, great! I love dance.

34:40.706 --> 34:41.705
Yeah.

34:44.776 --> 34:47.381
Here, you're invited.

34:49.616 --> 34:51.484
Oh, it's interesting.

34:51.519 --> 34:52.584
Is this Arabic?

34:53.620 --> 34:55.356
Yes, Amir is Arabic.

34:55.391 --> 34:57.655
And also a pain in the ass.

34:57.690 --> 35:00.691
So everything we do
has to have Arabic in it.

35:00.726 --> 35:02.858
Even if it's not connected at
all.

35:02.893 --> 35:05.432
Tomorrow is their premiere
and then they're moving to
Berlin together.

35:05.467 --> 35:07.665
-Yeah...
-Wait, you're leaving Israel?

35:08.635 --> 35:09.401
Yes.

35:09.834 --> 35:10.899
But I thought you were breaking
up.

35:10.934 --> 35:12.340
We are breaking up.

35:12.375 --> 35:13.638
So why are you moving
to Berlin with him?

35:15.411 --> 35:16.608
My best friend is dumping me.

35:16.643 --> 35:18.313
I told you, you could come too,

35:18.348 --> 35:19.215
but you didn't want to.

35:20.651 --> 35:22.383
Of course I want to but I need
to finish university first, you
know.

35:22.583 --> 35:23.780
Tomer can't move away

35:23.815 --> 35:26.288
because his mother is stuck
in the kibbutz.

35:26.323 --> 35:27.487
He will never leave her.

35:27.522 --> 35:28.158
That's bullshit.

35:29.425 --> 35:31.821
So, what do you plan
on doing in Berlin?

35:33.726 --> 35:36.265
Basically the same thing, dance,

35:36.300 --> 35:38.300
only with some more people
in the audience.

35:38.335 --> 35:41.303
Maybe there I can afford more
than a kid's meal at McDonald's.

35:41.338 --> 35:42.436
Wow.

35:42.471 --> 35:44.141
Is that the big dream then?

35:45.540 --> 35:46.935
What, a Big Mac?

35:46.970 --> 35:48.706
Oh, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

35:49.478 --> 35:50.543
I don't know...

35:51.746 --> 35:53.447
I guess I've just given up
trying to make it happen here.

35:54.384 --> 35:55.416
Why?

35:58.553 --> 36:00.817
It's so hard to be
an artist here, you know?

36:00.852 --> 36:02.885
You have to beg
the government for budgets

36:02.920 --> 36:04.392
and then pray that anyone comes,

36:04.427 --> 36:07.263
especially if your partner
is a Palestinian.

36:08.332 --> 36:11.234
A couple of years ago,
we had a big new show.

36:12.435 --> 36:14.369
A week before the premiere,

36:14.965 --> 36:16.899
everything in Gaza got crazy.

36:16.934 --> 36:18.736
Like, missile attacks, bombings,

36:18.771 --> 36:20.177
you know, all that shit.

36:21.346 --> 36:23.840
And at the end we performed
in front of three people.

36:23.875 --> 36:25.215
Tomer was one of them.

36:27.318 --> 36:30.583
Well, I hate to be the guy who
says,
"When I was your age," but...

36:30.618 --> 36:31.683
"When I was your age..."

36:31.718 --> 36:33.586
But, really,

36:34.556 --> 36:36.952
we protested, we got arrested.

36:37.427 --> 36:39.493
We did everything we could
to change the world.

36:40.397 --> 36:41.660
Maybe it wasn't very much,

36:41.695 --> 36:44.465
but some... some things did
change.

36:48.603 --> 36:49.734
I don't know,

36:50.572 --> 36:52.902
maybe this is my protest,

36:52.937 --> 36:57.346
to leave this place
and think only of myself for
once.

36:57.381 --> 36:58.578
To really live,

36:58.976 --> 37:00.613
not only survive.

37:02.716 --> 37:04.947
Isn't it odd that
you're moving to Germany?

37:05.521 --> 37:08.720
A place that symbolizes
Jewish tragedy.

37:19.469 --> 37:19.995
What's so funny?

37:21.198 --> 37:22.965
Nothing, we're just high,
but you know that Berlin is like

37:23.000 --> 37:24.802
the coolest place for many
years.

37:24.837 --> 37:26.738
Tons of young Israelis move
there.

37:39.621 --> 37:40.587
Come.

39:38.938 --> 39:39.805
Michael!

39:58.793 --> 39:59.792
Hey.

40:01.059 --> 40:02.498
Look what I have.

40:04.667 --> 40:05.897
-Wow.
-I cut class today

40:07.200 --> 40:09.703
and on the way here I stopped
at this like second-hand
bookshop

40:09.738 --> 40:11.001
and that's where I found it.

40:11.036 --> 40:12.035
How cool is that?

40:15.172 --> 40:16.171
Tomer.

40:48.876 --> 40:49.908
Bye.

40:59.183 --> 41:00.622
Is that your boyfriend?

41:02.252 --> 41:03.757
I don't have a boyfriend.

41:04.694 --> 41:06.496
We're just hanging out, that's
all.

41:07.730 --> 41:10.060
He wanted more,
but I'm not into all that.

41:10.799 --> 41:11.897
Why?

41:13.065 --> 41:13.701
Just not.

41:14.937 --> 41:18.508
People today are so desperate
for love and relationships,

41:18.708 --> 41:19.674
so when they meet someone cool

41:20.677 --> 41:22.479
they immediately want to define
and label and...

41:23.882 --> 41:26.241
I mean, why would I wanna have
sex
with only one person, you know?

41:27.145 --> 41:29.585
I don't wanna
tie myself down to anyone.

41:29.620 --> 41:30.949
A man, a woman.

41:30.984 --> 41:32.214
One partner, two partners,

41:32.249 --> 41:34.689
even 100 partners, you know?
I just...

41:35.824 --> 41:37.824
I want to enjoy everything
life has to offer.

41:39.322 --> 41:43.731
Sure, but one of the things
this world has to offer is
the...

41:43.766 --> 41:45.601
the love of another human being.

41:46.571 --> 41:48.934
Some might even say
it's the best thing life has to
offer.

41:53.644 --> 41:54.709
Do you still fuck?

41:55.976 --> 41:57.074
Excuse me?

41:57.879 --> 41:58.944
You and...

41:58.979 --> 42:00.979
David, you still have sex?

42:01.982 --> 42:03.883
-Well...
-You don't have to answer this
question

42:03.918 --> 42:05.247
-if you don't want to.
-No, no.

42:05.282 --> 42:08.855
I'm perfectly okay answering,
it's just that, well...

42:09.957 --> 42:12.760
Yeah, we do occasionally have
sex.

42:13.994 --> 42:15.125
Occasionally?

42:15.831 --> 42:16.830
What does it mean?

42:18.064 --> 42:20.702
What does that mean?
It means occasionally.

42:22.299 --> 42:24.607
Obviously, as a relationship
evolves

42:24.642 --> 42:27.269
some things happen less
frequently
than they once did.

42:27.711 --> 42:29.909
And I'm not just talking about
sex.

42:30.648 --> 42:31.845
Lots of things change.

42:32.947 --> 42:34.650
So you have an open
relationship?

42:34.685 --> 42:35.882
No...

42:36.753 --> 42:37.785
Not as far as I know.

42:39.954 --> 42:41.052
Wow.

42:42.255 --> 42:43.923
I can't imagine no sex-life,
I mean, that would kill me.

42:44.123 --> 42:45.595
Well, I didn't say there was
no...

42:45.630 --> 42:47.157
Forget about sex, just...

42:47.731 --> 42:48.895
kissing.

42:49.194 --> 42:50.930
I mean, don't you miss it?
Like...

42:51.768 --> 42:54.769
Like a really good kiss that
makes you forget about
everything,

42:54.804 --> 42:55.638
you know?

42:59.237 --> 43:00.269
You're a funny one.

43:01.745 --> 43:02.645
Why?

43:03.614 --> 43:06.011
Because for
Mr. I-don't-want-a-boyfriend-

43:06.046 --> 43:06.979
no-happy-endings,

43:08.115 --> 43:11.148
you sound pretty romantic
about the power of a kiss.

43:16.287 --> 43:17.858
I'm gonna take a shower.

44:35.333 --> 44:36.365
Hey! Hey!

44:36.400 --> 44:38.708
It's okay, it's okay.
Shh...

44:38.941 --> 44:40.369
Shh...

44:41.504 --> 44:42.745
Hey!

44:45.849 --> 44:47.046
He fell in the water.

44:48.214 --> 44:49.279
I'm sorry,
I was just worried he might...

44:51.756 --> 44:53.283
-Michal!
-I was just, I was only trying
to help,

44:53.318 --> 44:54.449
I saw the baby going in the
water.

44:56.926 --> 44:58.827
I was only trying to help,
I saw him fall and...

44:58.862 --> 44:59.322
It's okay.

45:04.164 --> 45:05.064
I'm really sorry.

45:05.966 --> 45:06.868
-Come on.
-It's okay, forget about it.

45:15.043 --> 45:16.207
Jesus.

46:02.519 --> 46:03.518
Hey you.

46:03.553 --> 46:04.420
Hi.

46:05.126 --> 46:06.356
Everything okay?

46:06.556 --> 46:08.160
Yeah, everything's fine.

46:08.195 --> 46:09.524
Tried you earlier.

46:09.559 --> 46:11.064
I know, I was busy.

46:13.068 --> 46:16.102
Okay, listen,
I just, I talked to Suzanne,

46:16.137 --> 46:18.170
I know she called you earlier,

46:18.205 --> 46:20.271
she wasn't supposed to do that.

46:20.306 --> 46:21.910
I'm really sorry, okay?

46:21.945 --> 46:23.373
But let's just wait
till you get home

46:23.408 --> 46:25.012
and we can talk
about this together,

46:25.047 --> 46:25.782
just the two of us.

46:26.985 --> 46:29.511
I mean, at the end of the day,
this is good news, right?

46:29.920 --> 46:32.822
Yeah, I thought it was something
we were supposed to be doing
together.

46:33.154 --> 46:34.087
Michael, come on,

46:35.423 --> 46:37.992
you realize this is just the
first step
of a very long process.

46:38.027 --> 46:41.094
-Don't you remember?
-I realize you want this more
than I do,

46:41.129 --> 46:43.932
enough to, you know,
go get the ball rolling behind
my back.

46:44.594 --> 46:46.869
No, actually, I...

46:48.466 --> 46:51.038
Michael, no balls are rolling

46:51.073 --> 46:52.402
and if you don't wanna talk to
her

46:52.437 --> 46:55.108
I will call Suzanne
and I will let her know.

46:55.880 --> 46:57.880
But from the information
that has been shared with me

46:57.915 --> 47:00.047
this woman sounds pretty
amazing.

47:01.083 --> 47:03.116
-Maybe even better than Ashley.
-I don't wanna meet her.

47:04.119 --> 47:05.316
I don't wanna meet anyone.

47:05.549 --> 47:06.922
Wait, what do you mean?

47:07.353 --> 47:09.023
I want us to let it go.

47:10.323 --> 47:12.092
-Let what go?
-You know what.

47:12.930 --> 47:15.029
This, the baby.

47:15.229 --> 47:16.327
All of it.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.065
Maybe it was a mistake.

47:19.200 --> 47:21.563
Michael, I'm very sorry
this happened,

47:21.598 --> 47:24.269
but you don't get to just
unilaterally decide this,

47:24.304 --> 47:25.941
-we got to talk about...
-Hold on.

47:29.144 --> 47:31.540
Sorry to disturb, but we need
to go if we don't wanna be late.

47:31.575 --> 47:33.443
Of course, just give me a
second.

47:33.478 --> 47:34.477
Okay.

47:41.387 --> 47:42.320
Who was that?

47:42.355 --> 47:44.927
It was my... landlord.

47:45.325 --> 47:46.962
He's invited me to a dance
thing.

47:46.997 --> 47:47.930
A dance thing?

47:49.033 --> 47:50.427
Yes, some of his friends
are performing at something,

47:50.462 --> 47:52.165
I really should get going.

47:52.530 --> 47:53.529
Fine.

47:54.301 --> 47:55.905
-Enjoy the dance.
-Yeah, okay.

51:00.520 --> 51:01.321
Come dance with us.

51:02.023 --> 51:03.323
Ah, I think I'm gonna go home.

51:04.359 --> 51:05.754
-What?
-Yeah, I've had a few too many
drinks

51:05.789 --> 51:07.096
and you know, all the jetlag.

51:07.131 --> 51:07.789
Have some MD.

51:08.625 --> 51:09.824
-What?
-MDMA, it will wake you up.

51:09.859 --> 51:11.364
I'm good, thank you.

51:11.795 --> 51:12.629
Ever tried it?

51:13.598 --> 51:15.467
Ah, yes, I've tried some
back in my twenties.

51:16.338 --> 51:17.370
The 1920s?

51:17.570 --> 51:18.767
Very funny.

51:20.639 --> 51:22.738
Go, go, have a good time.

51:23.510 --> 51:24.278
I'll see you back home.

51:44.696 --> 51:46.399
Wow, home already?

51:46.434 --> 51:47.796
What, the party is over?

51:48.271 --> 51:49.567
You're wearing pajamas.

51:50.405 --> 51:51.503
Yes, I am, and?

51:51.901 --> 51:53.274
Who wears pajamas?

51:53.507 --> 51:54.539
A lot of people.

51:54.739 --> 51:56.772
Really? Where? In Downton Abbey?

51:57.874 --> 52:01.447
Well, my dad wore pajamas,
my grandfather did as well,

52:01.779 --> 52:05.220
which makes me a proud
third-generation pajama wearer.

52:06.289 --> 52:07.750
Exactly, it's a grandfather
thing.

52:09.754 --> 52:12.260
Why do you always gotta
make me feel like such an old
man?

52:12.724 --> 52:14.757
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do
that,

52:14.792 --> 52:16.660
I don't see you
as an old man, really.

52:19.269 --> 52:20.400
What's that?

52:20.963 --> 52:22.600
This guy on "Atraf."

52:22.800 --> 52:23.700
"Atraf"?

52:23.735 --> 52:25.669
The Israeli Grindr.

52:26.243 --> 52:27.473
Oh, okay.

52:28.839 --> 52:31.675
So this guy is texting me
all the time

52:31.875 --> 52:33.908
and he wants me to treat him
like a chair.

52:34.647 --> 52:36.383
And it's a pity,
'cause look, he's really hot.

52:38.486 --> 52:39.881
I really don't get this.

52:40.587 --> 52:41.586
What's not to get?

52:42.722 --> 52:44.820
I don't know,
ordering in sex like it's a
pizza.

52:45.460 --> 52:47.559
How is that any way
to meet somebody?

52:47.594 --> 52:49.792
A quick way, no drama.

52:51.499 --> 52:52.894
You see,
all these guys are very close.

52:57.571 --> 52:58.471
What do you think about him?

53:00.376 --> 53:01.639
He's good looking.

53:03.247 --> 53:04.642
-Really?
-Yeah, I mean...

53:04.677 --> 53:07.546
Come on, how do you
resist a body like that?

53:08.945 --> 53:10.582
Should I ask him to come over?

53:12.421 --> 53:13.519
What, for me?

53:14.258 --> 53:15.124
For us.

53:16.821 --> 53:18.887
I have...
I don't know, I don't think so.

53:18.922 --> 53:21.263
Too late,
he's gonna be here in 7 minutes.

53:28.503 --> 53:29.568
Hi.

53:29.834 --> 53:30.899
Hi.

53:36.038 --> 53:37.246
Hi.

53:38.579 --> 53:39.413
Hi.

53:39.448 --> 53:40.180
I'm Michael.

53:41.318 --> 53:43.417
Kobi.
Nice... nice to meet you.

53:45.652 --> 53:47.388
Come on in, have a seat.

53:58.027 --> 53:58.828
Nice pajamas.

53:59.797 --> 54:02.766
Thanks, they've been
in my family for years.

54:10.446 --> 54:11.544
Where are you from?

54:11.777 --> 54:14.646
I'm, uh, from the US.
New York City.

54:15.484 --> 54:16.714
Cool, cool.

54:17.354 --> 54:19.519
I never been, I would love to
go.

54:21.556 --> 54:22.522
Well, you should.

54:22.887 --> 54:23.721
I will.

54:24.590 --> 54:26.757
It's very expensive right now,
but...

54:27.089 --> 54:28.297
I will.

54:42.775 --> 54:44.973
Are you two a couple?

54:46.647 --> 54:49.351
No, no, I'm here on business.

54:50.013 --> 54:52.046
Okay, what do you do?

54:52.081 --> 54:54.686
I'm a journalist. A writer.

54:54.721 --> 54:56.358
He writes for The New York
Times,

54:56.591 --> 54:57.854
so you better be good.

56:48.472 --> 56:49.537
Good night.

57:10.593 --> 57:12.153
Oh, fuck...

57:52.866 --> 57:53.832
Fuck.

58:02.645 --> 58:03.710
Michael.

59:54.020 --> 59:56.086
Hey, what's going on?

59:56.418 --> 59:57.923
Hi, Tomer.

59:58.387 --> 59:59.958
I think it's best if I got a
hotel.

59:59.993 --> 1:00:01.322
-What?
-I really need to work and...

1:00:01.357 --> 1:00:02.664
Why? What happened?

1:00:03.766 --> 1:00:06.030
Don't worry, you'll be paid in
full.

1:00:06.065 --> 1:00:06.664
Why are you going?

1:00:07.429 --> 1:00:09.297
-Are you Michael?
-Yes.

1:00:09.332 --> 1:00:11.772
Michael, wait, please.
I got us muffins, come on.

1:00:11.807 --> 1:00:12.905
Stay.

1:00:13.171 --> 1:00:14.973
You have one more night,
why would you...

1:00:15.206 --> 1:00:17.910
Also my mom wants you to come
to the kibbutz for dinner,
she...

1:00:18.275 --> 1:00:19.846
She's cooking non-stop
since last night,

1:00:19.881 --> 1:00:20.880
she'll kill me if you don't
come.

1:00:33.026 --> 1:00:34.157
Stay.

1:00:35.325 --> 1:00:36.995
It's okay, you can go.

1:01:31.447 --> 1:01:33.084
See this place over there?

1:01:34.087 --> 1:01:35.922
There was my first kiss.

1:01:36.793 --> 1:01:38.254
Maya Noodleman.

1:01:38.289 --> 1:01:40.256
We were 11.

1:01:40.995 --> 1:01:43.831
Yeah... We went behind
one of the machines and kissed

1:01:43.866 --> 1:01:45.294
until she started to cry,

1:01:45.835 --> 1:01:47.395
'cause a bee stung her
in the eye.

1:01:49.905 --> 1:01:50.431
They used to make honey here,

1:01:51.300 --> 1:01:53.775
that's what made
the kibbutz so famous.

1:01:53.810 --> 1:01:54.908
Oh, sweet,

1:01:55.240 --> 1:01:56.778
never been to a honey factory.

1:01:57.044 --> 1:01:59.473
Oh no, they stopped making
honey here many years ago.

1:02:00.014 --> 1:02:01.882
They sold everything to some...

1:02:02.214 --> 1:02:05.754
giant global corporation, you
know.

1:02:06.086 --> 1:02:08.383
They still use
the kibbutz logo for sales.

1:02:08.418 --> 1:02:10.385
To keep it authentic, you know.

1:02:10.420 --> 1:02:11.727
That's a pity.

1:02:12.389 --> 1:02:14.290
Yeah, maybe.

1:02:32.178 --> 1:02:33.441
Nice to meet you, I'm Malka.

1:02:33.476 --> 1:02:35.377
I'm Michael,
really nice to meet you.

1:02:41.385 --> 1:02:44.925
I'm very sorry I didn't have
much time to prepare a lot.

1:02:44.960 --> 1:02:47.191
Tomer only told me that you are
coming in the last minute.

1:02:52.594 --> 1:02:54.363
-This is so wonderful.
-Thank you.

1:02:54.398 --> 1:02:56.398
Especially this,
what's this called again?

1:02:59.304 --> 1:03:02.107
It's my mom's top-secret
pumpkin tahini.

1:03:02.274 --> 1:03:04.274
She won't reveal the recipe to
anyone.

1:03:04.309 --> 1:03:07.211
I don't blame her,
it's really delicious, thank
you.

1:03:07.851 --> 1:03:09.785
Tomer is also a good cook.

1:03:10.051 --> 1:03:12.854
He knows how to make
a good Israeli breakfast.

1:03:13.549 --> 1:03:15.087
Have you made him one?

1:03:15.386 --> 1:03:16.990
Didn't have the time yet.

1:03:17.960 --> 1:03:19.388
How long are you going to stay?

1:03:20.490 --> 1:03:21.929
I leave tomorrow.

1:03:21.964 --> 1:03:23.964
-Already?
-Yeah, just here for work.

1:03:24.593 --> 1:03:27.968
The idea is to see
how much I can discover about a
city

1:03:28.003 --> 1:03:28.430
in just five days.

1:03:29.366 --> 1:03:31.400
And what did you discover
about Tel Aviv?

1:03:34.878 --> 1:03:36.009
I don't know...

1:03:36.440 --> 1:03:38.473
Maybe that it's full of
contradictions?

1:03:38.508 --> 1:03:41.245
You know, it's chaotic and
tense,

1:03:41.280 --> 1:03:44.017
but at the same time
it's completely laid back.

1:03:45.383 --> 1:03:46.954
It's unlike any other place
I've visited.

1:03:47.220 --> 1:03:50.320
But that maybe because
Tomer here was my guide.

1:03:51.026 --> 1:03:54.390
I've enjoyed having him around,
seeing the city through his
eyes.

1:03:55.030 --> 1:03:56.964
I'm sure the feeling is mutual.

1:03:56.999 --> 1:03:58.933
He never brings anyone back
to the kibbutz.

1:04:00.970 --> 1:04:02.167
I'm embarrassing you?

1:04:03.269 --> 1:04:06.171
I used to be the cool mom,
once upon a time.

1:04:06.206 --> 1:04:07.436
I was in all his movies,

1:04:08.439 --> 1:04:11.407
but now if only he could,
he would, poof,

1:04:11.442 --> 1:04:12.375
make me disappear.

1:04:12.641 --> 1:04:14.212
I wouldn't make you disappear,

1:04:14.412 --> 1:04:16.313
but I might hit
the mute button sometimes.

1:04:22.992 --> 1:04:24.057
Do you have children, Michael?

1:04:25.357 --> 1:04:26.928
No, no, I don't.

1:04:27.524 --> 1:04:29.227
And you've never wanted any?

1:04:30.131 --> 1:04:33.000
Tomer mentioned that
you have a partner for many
years.

1:04:33.035 --> 1:04:36.003
Yes, well,
when we were the right age,

1:04:36.038 --> 1:04:38.599
it was much less common
for gay men to have children,

1:04:38.634 --> 1:04:41.437
and now that it's actually
a viable option...

1:04:42.209 --> 1:04:43.406
I guess we're just too old.

1:04:43.441 --> 1:04:45.144
What are you talking about?

1:04:45.179 --> 1:04:47.949
Here in the kibbutz
there is a couple, two women,

1:04:47.984 --> 1:04:49.280
not young at all,

1:04:49.315 --> 1:04:51.150
that just had beautiful twins.

1:04:51.185 --> 1:04:52.349
Everything is possible now.

1:04:53.022 --> 1:04:54.483
You know, if only I could,

1:04:54.518 --> 1:04:56.584
I would have a few more like
him.

1:04:57.092 --> 1:04:58.993
That's the only one thing I...

1:05:03.197 --> 1:05:04.933
-Regret.
-Regret, yeah.

1:05:04.968 --> 1:05:06.429
Not having more children.

1:05:07.531 --> 1:05:09.267
You know, I had him on my own,

1:05:09.302 --> 1:05:12.006
well, with a little help
from the sperm bank,

1:05:12.437 --> 1:05:15.108
also not the most traditional
thing,

1:05:15.143 --> 1:05:16.978
especially here in the kibbutz.

1:05:17.013 --> 1:05:19.310
Everybody said, "This is not
right,

1:05:19.345 --> 1:05:21.543
"a child should grow up
with a father,"

1:05:21.578 --> 1:05:23.314
but I think it's bullshit.

1:05:23.349 --> 1:05:24.645
Father, mother...

1:05:25.054 --> 1:05:27.582
The only thing a child needs
to grow up is love.

1:05:28.189 --> 1:05:30.189
Well, you did a great job
with this one,

1:05:30.521 --> 1:05:31.960
congratulations.

1:05:33.557 --> 1:05:34.358
L'chaim!

1:05:35.361 --> 1:05:36.393
But listen, Michael,

1:05:37.132 --> 1:05:38.692
it's never too late
to have a child.

1:05:39.761 --> 1:05:41.563
Any time is the right time.

1:05:42.632 --> 1:05:45.105
I'm sure your parents
wanted grandchildren,

1:05:45.140 --> 1:05:46.700
all parents want grandchildren.

1:05:48.506 --> 1:05:51.177
My father certainly didn't,
at least not from me.

1:05:51.608 --> 1:05:55.412
I mean, when I told him we were
even thinking about surrogacy,

1:05:55.711 --> 1:05:57.348
he said we were crazy.

1:05:57.383 --> 1:05:58.382
That the world had gone mad

1:05:59.651 --> 1:06:01.220
for allowing two men
to even think about having
children.

1:06:02.025 --> 1:06:03.189
He will change his mind

1:06:04.258 --> 1:06:05.719
once you'll bring him
a grandchild, believe me.

1:06:08.724 --> 1:06:10.031
I'm not so sure about that.

1:06:11.034 --> 1:06:11.626
Why not?

1:06:16.039 --> 1:06:18.336
Well, the truth is,

1:06:18.569 --> 1:06:20.569
we did try, my husband and I.

1:06:21.275 --> 1:06:23.044
Quite recently, in fact.

1:06:23.079 --> 1:06:24.210
We...

1:06:24.773 --> 1:06:26.212
we found a wonderful surrogate,

1:06:26.247 --> 1:06:28.445
she got pregnant
almost immediately.

1:06:29.679 --> 1:06:32.746
And everything went
really, really well.

1:06:34.453 --> 1:06:36.684
We were so happy waiting,
you remember what that's like.

1:06:36.719 --> 1:06:40.028
All the preparations, we...

1:06:40.063 --> 1:06:42.723
we turned the guest room
into a nursery and...

1:06:43.528 --> 1:06:45.561
And then six months ago,

1:06:46.267 --> 1:06:48.762
we made it
to the delivery room and...

1:06:49.468 --> 1:06:50.731
And things went...

1:06:51.470 --> 1:06:52.766
Well, not so good.

1:06:54.176 --> 1:06:56.044
We lost our baby.

1:06:58.378 --> 1:06:59.542
Oh.

1:07:01.777 --> 1:07:03.315
My father, he...

1:07:03.548 --> 1:07:07.220
He came to the hospital
and he didn't say a thing to me.

1:07:07.255 --> 1:07:09.090
Didn't hug me or anything,

1:07:09.125 --> 1:07:11.455
he just stood there with
this look on his face, like:

1:07:11.490 --> 1:07:13.226
"See? See, I told you so."

1:07:18.299 --> 1:07:19.430
Oh my god,

1:07:20.334 --> 1:07:21.696
I'm so sorry, I...

1:07:22.765 --> 1:07:24.534
didn't mean to spoil the dinner.

1:07:27.869 --> 1:07:29.671
It's not as if
I actually knew her,

1:07:29.706 --> 1:07:32.146
she was, you know,
she was just a newborn.

1:07:33.281 --> 1:07:35.545
We never even really had
a chance to bond with her,

1:07:35.580 --> 1:07:37.217
just the idea of her.

1:07:39.122 --> 1:07:40.352
In any case,

1:07:40.387 --> 1:07:42.156
we've put it behind us now.

1:07:54.170 --> 1:07:55.631
What name did you give her?

1:07:58.471 --> 1:07:59.833
We named her Sarah,

1:08:00.407 --> 1:08:02.209
after my mother.

1:08:14.388 --> 1:08:16.322
I'm really so sorry, I...

1:08:17.160 --> 1:08:18.720
certainly hadn't planned on...

1:08:20.658 --> 1:08:21.459
I'm sorry.

1:08:21.890 --> 1:08:23.164
No, no.

1:08:23.562 --> 1:08:25.661
It's I who am sorry.

1:08:25.696 --> 1:08:27.465
Very, very sorry.

1:09:42.542 --> 1:09:44.476
Home sweet home.

1:10:27.554 --> 1:10:29.620
So, did you finish packing?

1:10:34.363 --> 1:10:35.956
What the fuck?

1:10:36.959 --> 1:10:39.729
I can't in good conscience
leave you with a closet

1:10:39.962 --> 1:10:42.336
that looks like it's been
ransacked by baboons.

1:10:42.503 --> 1:10:43.568
But that's how I like it.

1:10:43.867 --> 1:10:46.032
No, that's how you think
you like it.

1:10:46.067 --> 1:10:48.342
Why not just give my way a try?

1:10:48.377 --> 1:10:50.971
You may surprise yourself
and find out you prefer it.

1:10:51.578 --> 1:10:53.809
And if you don't, no need to
worry,

1:10:53.844 --> 1:10:55.811
I guarantee you
the baboons will return.

1:10:56.077 --> 1:10:58.044
How am I supposed to find
anything?

1:10:58.079 --> 1:11:00.684
It's very easy, I'm gonna show
you.

1:11:01.456 --> 1:11:02.686
Your nice shirts,

1:11:02.985 --> 1:11:05.018
all two of them, are right here.

1:11:05.625 --> 1:11:08.956
Your t-shirts all folded
and arranged by color

1:11:09.398 --> 1:11:10.529
are up there.

1:11:10.993 --> 1:11:13.334
Your jeans, sweaters,

1:11:13.765 --> 1:11:16.337
sweatshirts, sweatpants

1:11:16.372 --> 1:11:17.437
are there.

1:11:17.703 --> 1:11:20.033
Your shoes are down on the
floor,

1:11:20.068 --> 1:11:22.706
your sneakers, your flip-flops.

1:11:22.741 --> 1:11:25.071
Your underwear is in this drawer

1:11:25.106 --> 1:11:27.040
and your socks are here.

1:11:27.075 --> 1:11:29.746
But we have a bit of a problem
with your socks.

1:11:29.781 --> 1:11:31.616
Come here,
give me a hand with this,

1:11:32.388 --> 1:11:34.751
we have some serious
matchmaking to do.

1:11:35.391 --> 1:11:38.887
And please, no projecting
your crippling fear of
relationships

1:11:38.922 --> 1:11:40.922
onto these poor, defenseless
socks.

1:11:41.463 --> 1:11:43.661
Socks, in case you didn't know,

1:11:43.861 --> 1:11:44.959
are monogamous.

1:11:45.368 --> 1:11:46.400
They're like swans.

1:11:53.134 --> 1:11:54.342
Wait...

1:11:54.641 --> 1:11:56.476
What are you doing, what...

1:11:56.511 --> 1:11:59.875
You're murdering them,
don't roll them into a ball
like that,

1:11:59.910 --> 1:12:02.042
it makes them lose their
elasticity.

1:12:02.451 --> 1:12:03.549
Here, you...

1:12:04.652 --> 1:12:06.783
You just wanna put them
right on top of each other,

1:12:06.818 --> 1:12:08.488
look, I'll show you with this.

1:12:08.886 --> 1:12:10.424
You just lay

1:12:11.427 --> 1:12:13.053
one right on top of the other

1:12:13.858 --> 1:12:15.957
and then you ever so gently

1:12:16.828 --> 1:12:18.696
just bring them together.

1:12:20.535 --> 1:12:21.567
Like a perfect square.

1:12:22.537 --> 1:12:23.096
You're crazy.

1:12:35.418 --> 1:12:36.516
Excuse me, sir,

1:12:36.716 --> 1:12:38.078
have you seen my partner?

1:12:38.113 --> 1:12:39.046
Looks just like me,

1:12:39.719 --> 1:12:41.582
blue with white stars.

1:12:45.659 --> 1:12:47.692
Um, no, I haven't seen him.

1:12:49.190 --> 1:12:50.464
Well,

1:12:51.467 --> 1:12:53.467
looks like we're the only
single socks left.

1:12:54.096 --> 1:12:55.766
I lost my mate too.

1:12:58.441 --> 1:12:59.737
Hey, I got an idea.

1:13:00.641 --> 1:13:02.069
Why don't we pair up?

1:13:03.105 --> 1:13:04.511
No way!

1:13:04.546 --> 1:13:05.875
You want me,

1:13:06.449 --> 1:13:08.108
a blue sock with white stars,

1:13:08.143 --> 1:13:10.946
to pair up with you,
a simple yellow sock?

1:13:10.981 --> 1:13:11.848
It will never work.

1:13:12.488 --> 1:13:14.983
Well, excuse me, geesh.

1:13:15.183 --> 1:13:17.084
Here I thought a young, hip,

1:13:17.119 --> 1:13:19.691
blue sock with white stars
would be open to experimenting.

1:13:20.826 --> 1:13:23.629
Why are you such a slave
to social conventions?

1:13:29.197 --> 1:13:30.801
-Wait.
-What?

1:13:31.166 --> 1:13:32.539
This song,

1:13:32.574 --> 1:13:34.442
you have to hear this song,
wait.

1:16:37.286 --> 1:16:39.891
May I ask Monsieur
to move to the balcony?

1:16:39.926 --> 1:16:42.355
The best breakfast in Tel Aviv
is now being served.

1:16:46.735 --> 1:16:47.866
Ichs.

1:16:48.803 --> 1:16:49.368
What?

1:16:50.002 --> 1:16:51.067
I thought you hated onion.

1:16:52.268 --> 1:16:54.037
Of course I do, but you love it.

1:16:55.106 --> 1:16:56.941
Oh, would you care for
some bread I just baked,

1:16:56.976 --> 1:16:58.173
I mean, bought?

1:17:00.408 --> 1:17:04.850
This looks just like the challah
my grandfather used to throw at
us

1:17:04.885 --> 1:17:06.346
every Friday before Shabbat.

1:17:07.756 --> 1:17:08.887
Why did he do that?

1:17:08.922 --> 1:17:09.888
Who knows,

1:17:10.857 --> 1:17:12.187
but basically instead
of slicing the bread

1:17:12.222 --> 1:17:13.760
he'd just tear pieces off of it

1:17:13.795 --> 1:17:16.829
and throw it at anyone
who wanted some.

1:17:16.864 --> 1:17:20.932
I always thought of it like some
old-fashioned religious custom,
you know.

1:17:20.967 --> 1:17:21.999
The breaking of the bread.

1:17:22.935 --> 1:17:24.100
We didn't do those things
in the kibbutz.

1:17:27.204 --> 1:17:29.875
I have to ask my father
what it meant when I call him,

1:17:30.845 --> 1:17:32.207
tell him I was back in Israel.

1:17:52.196 --> 1:17:53.965
Alright, alright...

1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:54.999
No, no...

1:18:01.205 --> 1:18:02.336
What?

1:18:05.374 --> 1:18:07.242
Look at this picture.

1:18:07.277 --> 1:18:08.309
-What's happening?
-It's a pigeon, but look,

1:18:09.245 --> 1:18:11.048
look what's going on
behind the pigeon...

1:18:11.083 --> 1:18:13.116
Are those two people having sex?

1:18:13.151 --> 1:18:15.184
-Yes.
-Wow.

1:18:18.057 --> 1:18:21.190
Look at that, is it real?

1:18:56.964 --> 1:18:58.964
You'll tell me
when it's online, right?

1:18:58.999 --> 1:19:00.130
I mean, the article.

1:19:00.330 --> 1:19:02.297
-I will.
-'Cause I really wanna read it.

1:19:02.332 --> 1:19:03.397
Okay.

1:19:07.073 --> 1:19:08.171
And you know what?

1:19:08.877 --> 1:19:10.008
What?

1:19:10.043 --> 1:19:11.911
I think you should write
another book.

1:19:12.441 --> 1:19:13.814
Call it:

1:19:14.278 --> 1:19:15.816
"The Nightmare Bar-Mitzvah,"

1:19:16.984 --> 1:19:18.786
and then I'll buy the rights
and make a great movie,

1:19:18.821 --> 1:19:21.217
which, of course,
will be better than your book.

1:19:21.252 --> 1:19:24.891
Which will be good too, but you
know,
just not as good as the movie.

1:19:25.960 --> 1:19:27.289
And then I'll win an Oscar.

1:19:28.659 --> 1:19:30.226
Yeah... And I'll probably share
it
with you, you know, 'cause...

1:19:30.899 --> 1:19:32.030
I'm nice.

1:19:33.198 --> 1:19:36.067
Well, I would like that very
much.

1:19:36.102 --> 1:19:37.904
Oscars or no Oscars.

1:19:55.583 --> 1:19:56.450
I think you should try again.

1:19:57.618 --> 1:19:58.551
Huh?

1:19:59.654 --> 1:20:00.993
I think you should try again,
I agree with my mom.

1:20:01.862 --> 1:20:03.292
I don't think
it's too late for you.

1:20:04.592 --> 1:20:05.866
Wow,

1:20:06.902 --> 1:20:08.363
I thought you didn't believe
in happy endings.

1:20:09.333 --> 1:20:11.003
It has nothing to do
with happy endings,

1:20:11.038 --> 1:20:13.533
I just think
you'll be a good father,

1:20:14.074 --> 1:20:15.172
that's all.

1:20:29.089 --> 1:20:30.418
Well, Tomer,

1:20:30.893 --> 1:20:32.321
I really should get going.

1:20:33.258 --> 1:20:35.159
But thank you for everything.

1:20:35.557 --> 1:20:37.128
You'll be in touch, right?

1:20:37.163 --> 1:20:38.228
About the article and...

1:20:38.263 --> 1:20:39.526
Of course, of course I will.

1:20:49.340 --> 1:20:50.438
Oh...

1:20:51.507 --> 1:20:52.880
Hey,

1:20:55.181 --> 1:20:56.510
it's okay.

1:20:59.053 --> 1:21:00.382
It's okay, Tomer.

1:21:02.551 --> 1:21:04.254
Everything is gonna be okay.

1:21:08.931 --> 1:21:10.161
Oh my god,

1:21:11.497 --> 1:21:14.264
I can't believe I'm crying
at the airport, it's so fucking
gay.

1:21:16.565 --> 1:21:18.169
Go, go, just...

1:21:18.534 --> 1:21:21.007
Just go, I'm okay.
I'm okay.

1:22:35.149 --> 1:22:36.280
Hey, it's me.

1:22:37.151 --> 1:22:38.414
I'm on the plane,

1:22:38.449 --> 1:22:40.515
it's a little too early
to call, so...

1:22:41.287 --> 1:22:44.057
If all goes well I'll be home
around five this afternoon.

1:22:45.324 --> 1:22:48.061
I was thinking maybe we could go
to Stone Park for dinner,

1:22:48.789 --> 1:22:50.591
we haven't done that
in a long time.

1:22:52.298 --> 1:22:54.331
Anyhow, I will see you soon.
