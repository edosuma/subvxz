[audience cheering
and applauding]

00:29.130 --> 00:30.195
hey, everybody,

00:30.197 --> 00:33.732
and welcome once again to
week two of battlebots,

00:33.734 --> 00:38.337
the only sport
actively precipitating the
eventual robot takeover.

00:38.339 --> 00:41.340
Hi, everyone, I'm chris rose,
joined by ufc legend,

00:41.342 --> 00:43.008
master of cage and screen.

00:43.010 --> 00:45.978
The number one ranked robot
fighting analyst in the world,

00:45.980 --> 00:47.913
because of course
there is only one.

00:47.915 --> 00:50.182
Say hello to kenny florian!

00:50.184 --> 00:51.917
[audience cheering
and applauding]

00:51.919 --> 00:54.920
that's right, chris. It's like
we've got a room
full of terminators,

00:54.922 --> 00:56.922
but sarah connor
has the controls.

00:58.993 --> 01:00.793
And speaking of
terminators, kenny,

01:00.795 --> 01:03.228
on deck, we have an
incredible sequel to week one

01:03.230 --> 01:06.065
that some say might actually
be better than the original.

01:06.067 --> 01:08.233
Terminator 2 is better.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.436
Oh,
that's a matter of opinion.

01:10.438 --> 01:12.905
Ah, it's definitely better.
[audience laughing]

01:12.907 --> 01:15.274
okay, why don't we get
back to the matchups?

01:16.844 --> 01:18.377
Ken, kenny?

01:18.379 --> 01:20.212
It's just undeniably
a better film.

01:20.214 --> 01:21.914
[audience laughing]

01:21.916 --> 01:25.284
all right. More importantly,
we have a vicious lineup of
teams fighting to qualify

01:25.286 --> 01:28.754
for the greatest tournament
this side of judgment day.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.956
<i> [chris] let's take a look</i>
<i>  at tonight's fight card.</i>

01:30.958 --> 01:32.758
<i>  From the big</i>
<i>  and tall department,</i>

01:32.760 --> 01:34.927
<i>  we'll see a clash</i>
<i>  of the titans,</i>

01:34.929 --> 01:38.163
<i>  as the nearly</i>
<i>  six-foot tall mammoth</i>

01:38.165 --> 01:42.835
<i>  squares off</i>
<i> against the biggest horizontal</i>
<i>  spinner in the competition,</i>

01:42.837 --> 01:43.869
<i>  hijinx!</i>

01:45.039 --> 01:46.371
<i> [kenny] we've also</i>
<i>  got the moment</i>

01:46.373 --> 01:49.875
<i>  that battlebots universe</i>
<i>  has been waiting a year for.</i>

01:49.877 --> 01:52.778
<i>  It's the return of the</i>
<i>  little bot that could,</i>

01:52.780 --> 01:54.379
<i>  rusty.</i>

01:54.381 --> 01:57.783
<i> [chris] this is the cutest</i>
<i>  robot we've ever seen,</i>

01:57.785 --> 02:01.787
<i>  and it will not die!</i>

02:01.789 --> 02:03.555
<i> [kenny] everyone's favorite</i>
<i>  junkyard bot</i>

02:03.557 --> 02:07.059
<i>  will kick off its sophomore</i>
<i>  season against aren hill's</i>

02:07.061 --> 02:08.861
<i>  game-changing new flipper,</i>

02:08.863 --> 02:10.329
<i>  blip.</i>

02:10.331 --> 02:12.564
[chris] and it all leads
up to a main event

02:12.566 --> 02:16.902
<i>  that could potentially be</i>
<i>  a preview of this</i>
<i>  year's championship.</i>

02:16.904 --> 02:18.203
<i>  We'll see bloodsport</i>

02:18.205 --> 02:21.240
<i>  trying to carve up last</i>
<i>  season's runner up,</i>

02:21.242 --> 02:23.442
<i>  whiplash!</i>

02:23.444 --> 02:26.178
<i> [kenny] that's right, it's one</i>
<i> of the hardest hitting bots...</i>

02:26.180 --> 02:27.346
<i> [chris] whoa!</i>

02:27.381 --> 02:29.882
<i> [kenny] ...Against one of</i>
<i> the best drivers in the world.</i>

02:29.884 --> 02:33.185
<i>  And after falling just short</i>
<i>  of the giant nut last season,</i>

02:33.187 --> 02:34.520
<i>  matt vasquez tells us</i>

02:34.522 --> 02:36.955
<i>  he has unfinished</i>
<i>  business to attend to.</i>

02:38.526 --> 02:40.526
<i> [chris] but we're</i>
<i>  kicking the night off</i>

02:40.528 --> 02:45.564
<i>  with a matchup between</i>
<i>  a couple of 250-pound</i>
<i>  monster trucks.</i>

02:45.566 --> 02:46.765
<i>  Greg gibson</i>

02:46.767 --> 02:50.068
<i>  and the legendary yeti are</i>
<i>  back out of retirement</i>

02:50.070 --> 02:52.070
<i>  and ready to rumble</i>
<i>  with the man,</i>

02:52.072 --> 02:54.039
<i>  the myth,</i>
<i>  the maniac,</i>

02:54.041 --> 02:56.675
<i>  martin mason</i>
<i>  and the gritty, kitty,</i>

02:56.677 --> 02:58.010
<i>  madcatter.</i>

02:59.113 --> 03:00.345
You guys ready?

03:00.347 --> 03:02.548
[audience cheering
and applauding]

03:02.550 --> 03:04.149
I think they're ready.

03:04.151 --> 03:06.185
Faruq, take it away!

03:08.789 --> 03:11.590
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:11.592 --> 03:13.158
are you ready?

03:13.160 --> 03:17.229
It's robot fighting time!

03:17.231 --> 03:19.264
[audience cheering]

03:27.308 --> 03:29.441
[faruq] in the red square,

03:29.443 --> 03:31.376
he's got his game face on.

03:31.378 --> 03:32.811
He's armed and ready.

03:32.813 --> 03:35.180
Enemy's knees weak,
their palms are sweaty.

03:35.182 --> 03:37.916
There's vomit on
their controller already,
bot spaghetti.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.985
You only get one shot to die

03:39.987 --> 03:42.754
at the hands of the yeti!

03:42.756 --> 03:44.790
[audience cheering]

03:47.461 --> 03:49.361
<i> [chris] yeti is back,</i>

03:49.363 --> 03:52.197
<i>  but this bot looks</i>
<i>  like it's been on a diet.</i>

03:52.199 --> 03:53.865
<i>  To bring yeti out</i>
<i>  of retirement,</i>

03:53.867 --> 03:56.768
<i>  greg gibson teamed up</i>
<i>  with battlebox veteran</i>

03:56.770 --> 03:58.203
<i>  christian carlberg,</i>

03:58.205 --> 03:59.638
<i>  and together they</i>
<i>  made some</i>

03:59.640 --> 04:02.307
<i>  big changes for</i>
<i>  its comeback tour.</i>

04:02.309 --> 04:06.044
<i> [kenny] yeah, you can really</i>
<i>  see the christian carlberg</i>
<i>  influence here.</i>

04:06.046 --> 04:08.780
<i>  Yeti is now about</i>
<i>  20% more compact,</i>

04:08.782 --> 04:10.582
<i>  still 250 pounds,</i>

04:10.584 --> 04:13.018
<i>  just crammed into</i>
<i>  a smaller package.</i>

04:13.020 --> 04:15.821
<i>  But they've also had</i>
<i>  major power upgrades</i>

04:15.823 --> 04:17.356
<i>  so that 40-pound drum</i>

04:17.358 --> 04:20.826
<i>  can now actually hit</i>
<i>  about 25% harder.</i>

04:22.029 --> 04:23.962
[faruq] in the blue square,

04:23.964 --> 04:26.565
alice and the queen
can paint roses red.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.367
This cat's got one job,

04:28.369 --> 04:30.502
to make robots dead.

04:30.504 --> 04:33.705
He's traveled to the battlebox
through looking glasses,

04:33.707 --> 04:36.108
but the one thing
he's not through with,

04:36.110 --> 04:38.443
kicking your asses.

04:38.445 --> 04:41.446
It's the metal survivor
with the lunatic driver,

04:41.448 --> 04:43.815
madcatter!

04:43.817 --> 04:46.318
[audience cheering]

04:49.089 --> 04:51.023
yeah!

04:51.025 --> 04:53.325
<i> [chris] ooh, here they come.</i>

04:53.327 --> 04:54.626
<i>  Martin mason,</i>

04:54.628 --> 04:57.929
<i>  he's like if "macho man"</i>
<i>  randy savage had a master's</i>

04:57.931 --> 05:01.033
<i>  in mechanical</i>
<i>  engineering, kenny.</i>

05:01.035 --> 05:03.669
<i> [kenny] he's a wild man.</i>
<i>  Look at him.</i>

05:03.671 --> 05:06.238
<i>  And I think one reason</i>
<i>  martin is so excited</i>

05:06.240 --> 05:08.907
<i>  is this new 48-pound weapon.</i>

05:08.909 --> 05:12.411
<i>  It's the most powerful</i>
<i>  vertical spinner madcatter</i>
<i>  has ever had.</i>

05:12.413 --> 05:15.080
<i>  Looking for them to test</i>
<i>  that early and often</i>

05:15.082 --> 05:16.181
<i>  against yeti.</i>

05:16.183 --> 05:20.052
[audience cheering]

05:21.789 --> 05:23.388
[chris chuckles]

05:26.727 --> 05:28.327
<i>  we're about to fight yeti,</i>

05:28.329 --> 05:30.362
<i>  they've got an</i>
<i>  experienced build team,</i>

05:30.364 --> 05:32.130
<i>  they've got a solid driver,</i>

05:32.132 --> 05:34.032
<i>  but you know what?</i>
<i>  We're going to go in there.</i>

05:34.034 --> 05:35.467
<i>  We're going to spin faster.</i>

05:35.469 --> 05:36.768
<i>  We're going to drive faster.</i>

05:36.770 --> 05:38.203
<i>  We're going to be</i>
<i>  more aggressive.</i>

05:38.205 --> 05:39.838
<i>  We're just going to be more!</i>

05:39.840 --> 05:42.741
<i>  They're likely going to be</i>
<i>  running a vertical disc.</i>

05:42.743 --> 05:45.177
<i>  They're... They're fast.</i>
<i>  They're agile.</i>

05:45.179 --> 05:48.246
<i>  I think we'll probably be</i>
<i>  pretty evenly matched on</i>
<i>  on the weapon to weapon.</i>

05:48.248 --> 05:49.915
<i>  So I think it's going</i>
<i>  to come down to driving.</i>

05:49.917 --> 05:52.818
<i>  Win or lose,</i>
<i>  it's going to be very hard</i>
<i>  to... To knock us out.</i>

05:52.820 --> 05:56.521
<i> So if this can turn into a bar</i>
<i>  brawl, I like our chances.</i>

05:56.523 --> 05:57.556
Yeah.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.393
[automated voice]
<i>  robots, activate.</i>

06:02.963 --> 06:06.064
<i> [chris] a reminder that</i>
<i>  the new 16x8-foot</i>

06:06.066 --> 06:09.501
<i>  upper deck has reshaped the</i>
<i>  geometry of the battlebox.</i>

06:09.503 --> 06:12.571
<i>  It's created potentially</i>
<i>  deadly short corners,</i>

06:12.573 --> 06:17.075
<i>  and launching an opponent</i>
<i>  up there is a fresh new way</i>
<i>  to impress the judges.</i>

06:17.077 --> 06:19.911
<i>  It can create</i>
<i>  more contact and potentially</i>

06:19.913 --> 06:22.581
<i>  more knockouts this season.</i>

06:22.583 --> 06:24.916
<i>  For more on this fight</i>
<i>  and in particular,</i>

06:24.918 --> 06:26.551
<i>  madcatter's opponent,</i>

06:26.553 --> 06:28.854
<i>  our bot whisperer, pete,</i>
<i>  what do you have?</i>

06:28.856 --> 06:32.657
Gentlemen, I am predicting
a deep run for yeti.

06:32.659 --> 06:34.559
<i> -[chris] hmm.</i>
<i> -Putting that out</i>
<i> there right now.</i>

06:34.561 --> 06:36.995
Bringing in christian carlberg

06:36.997 --> 06:39.598
and his genius ability to take

06:39.600 --> 06:42.601
ten pounds of electronics and
fit it into a five-pound bag,

06:42.603 --> 06:44.436
he is going to take yeti,

06:44.438 --> 06:46.671
which still is the same dna,

06:46.673 --> 06:48.774
and take it further
with this new version.

06:48.776 --> 06:51.176
<i> [chris] you heard it</i>
<i>  here first.</i>

06:51.178 --> 06:52.277
Maybe.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.613
[all laughing]

06:54.615 --> 06:56.381
<i> [chris] well, we are in vegas.</i>

06:56.383 --> 06:59.618
<i>  Anybody know</i>
<i>  if the casinos are taking</i>
<i>  bets on robot combat yet?</i>

07:01.622 --> 07:03.555
[automated voice]
<i>  red team, ready?</i>

07:03.557 --> 07:05.190
-Mash it.
-Mash it.

07:06.693 --> 07:08.660
[audience cheering]

07:09.997 --> 07:11.930
[automated voice]
<i>  blue team, ready?</i>

07:11.932 --> 07:16.401
<i> [chris] that's madcatter's,</i>
<i>  calvin iba, standing next</i>
<i>  to martin mason,</i>

07:16.403 --> 07:18.870
<i>  led them to</i>
<i>  a 3-0 start last season.</i>

07:37.925 --> 07:39.958
[audience cheering]

07:44.898 --> 07:47.132
[chris]
<i>  let the bot battle begin.</i>

07:47.134 --> 07:49.468
<i>  Robots doing a little</i>
<i>  tango here to start.</i>

07:49.470 --> 07:53.405
<i>  Yeti on the attack, but</i>
<i>  madcatter gets the</i>
<i>  low ground out of the gate.</i>

07:53.407 --> 07:57.742
<i>  Yeti says, "I don't care.</i>
<i>  I'm just here to smash!"</i>

07:57.744 --> 07:59.444
<i> [kenny] this is</i>
<i>  greg gibson's first time</i>

07:59.446 --> 08:02.681
<i>  in the box with the</i>
<i>  new version of yeti.</i>

08:02.683 --> 08:04.549
<i> [chris] oh!</i>

08:04.551 --> 08:06.718
<i>  Well, it can still pack</i>
<i>  the punch. My goodness!</i>

08:06.720 --> 08:11.156
<i>  And how about yeti looking</i>
<i> like an olympic gymnast there?</i>

08:11.158 --> 08:13.658
<i> [kenny] well, I'll tell you</i>
<i>  what, this is exactly what</i>
<i>  yeti used to do.</i>

08:13.660 --> 08:17.629
<i>  They would drive on top</i>
<i>  of your opponents and smash.</i>

08:17.631 --> 08:22.234
<i> [chris] oh! Oh!</i>
<i>  That's a big one.</i>

08:22.236 --> 08:26.838
<i> [kenny] it's just amazing</i>
<i>  to see a 250-pound bot</i>
<i>  fly in the air.</i>

08:26.840 --> 08:29.741
-My goodness.
<i> -[chris] and you got to keep</i>
<i>  an eye on yeti's weapon.</i>

08:29.743 --> 08:32.210
<i>  It is not spinning right now.</i>

08:32.212 --> 08:34.613
<i>  Oh, gosh!</i>
<i> [kenny] uh-oh.</i>

08:34.615 --> 08:37.582
<i> There goes one of those tires.</i>
<i>  That's not good for yeti.</i>

08:37.584 --> 08:40.619
<i> [chris] no, that is not</i>
<i>  a positive development,</i>

08:40.621 --> 08:42.954
<i> as madcatter hanging back now,</i>

08:42.956 --> 08:46.725
<i>  looking to see if yeti</i>
<i>  had waved that white flag.</i>

08:46.727 --> 08:50.462
<i> [kenny] no, I think</i>
<i>  martin mason knows who</i>
<i>  he is dealing with.</i>

08:50.464 --> 08:51.796
<i>  We've seen</i>
<i>  yeti come back</i>

08:51.798 --> 08:53.832
<i>  from the dead</i>
<i>  in previous seasons.</i>

08:53.834 --> 08:57.102
<i>  Can it do it here</i>
<i>  against a devastating</i>
<i>  bot madcatter, though?</i>

08:57.104 --> 08:58.803
<i>  This is a whole</i>
<i>  different beast.</i>

08:58.805 --> 09:00.639
<i> [chris] and you might</i>
<i>  be thinking,</i>

09:00.641 --> 09:03.909
<i>  "well, if its drum spinner</i>
<i>  isn't working, it only has</i>
<i> three wheels, why keep going?"</i>

09:03.911 --> 09:05.143
<i>  well, just in case</i>

09:05.145 --> 09:07.279
<i>  something fails</i>
<i>  on its opponent.</i>

09:07.281 --> 09:08.747
<i> [kenny] spot on, chris.</i>

09:08.749 --> 09:11.149
<i>  This is what yeti is</i>
<i>  designed to do.</i>

09:11.151 --> 09:13.285
<i>  Be durable, stick and fight,</i>

09:13.287 --> 09:17.188
<i>  and be hard to kill.</i>
<i>  Madcatter can't</i>
<i>  mess around here. Oh!</i>

09:19.793 --> 09:23.762
<i> [chris] that shot has</i>
<i>  had yeti guts flying all</i>
<i>  across the battlebox.</i>

09:23.764 --> 09:26.031
<i>  Madcatter keeping</i>
<i>  the pressure on.</i>

09:26.033 --> 09:28.166
<i>  Can yeti resurrect itself?</i>

09:28.168 --> 09:31.636
<i>  Or is it night, night time?</i>

09:31.638 --> 09:35.674
<i>  Madcatter is picking yeti</i>
<i>  apart, literally, and I think</i>
<i>  that's going to be it.</i>

09:35.676 --> 09:36.741
[referee]
seven,...

09:36.743 --> 09:38.910
<i> [chris] the countdown is on.</i>

09:38.912 --> 09:42.480
<i>  Greg gibson and</i>
<i>  christian carlberg</i>
<i>  in disbelief.</i>

09:42.482 --> 09:45.183
[referee]
that's a knockout win!
Madcatter.

09:46.353 --> 09:49.054
<i>  [chris] martin mason gets</i>
<i>  the job done!</i>

09:49.056 --> 09:51.089
[audience cheering]

09:54.161 --> 09:59.698
yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

10:02.703 --> 10:05.403
<i> [chris] kenny, you gotta love</i>
<i>  the way this fight started.</i>

10:05.405 --> 10:08.073
<i>  Both bots were on the attack.</i>

10:08.075 --> 10:09.941
<i> [kenny] unless the way</i>
<i>  that both of these bots</i>

10:09.943 --> 10:12.577
<i>  matched up, you knew that</i>
<i> one was going to get finished.</i>

10:12.579 --> 10:14.279
<i>  These guys are so aggressive.</i>

10:14.281 --> 10:15.380
<i>  There's so much power</i>

10:15.382 --> 10:16.648
<i>  in both of these bots.</i>

10:16.650 --> 10:19.150
<i>  And dare I say that madcatter</i>

10:19.152 --> 10:21.152
<i>  out-yeti'd yeti.</i>

10:21.154 --> 10:24.222
<i> [chris] we'll give a ton</i>
<i>  of credit to yeti</i>
<i>  for sticking around.</i>

10:24.224 --> 10:26.458
<i>  It looks like they</i>
<i>  lost the belt early on</i>

10:26.460 --> 10:28.493
<i>  and eventually lost</i>
<i>  that wheel,</i>

10:28.495 --> 10:30.695
<i>  but just too much</i>
<i>  destructive power</i>

10:30.697 --> 10:33.698
<i>  from martin mason</i>
<i>  and his entire crew.</i>

10:33.700 --> 10:36.501
<i> [kenny] I think martin mason</i>
<i>  knows who he's dealing with.</i>

10:36.503 --> 10:38.069
<i>  It may take team yeti</i>

10:38.105 --> 10:41.206
<i>  a fight or two to get their</i>
<i>  sea legs with this</i>
<i>  new version of the bot,</i>

10:41.208 --> 10:43.241
<i>  but the first step</i>
<i>  is to rebuild</i>

10:43.243 --> 10:46.211
<i>  after this undressing</i>
<i>  by madcatter.</i>

10:48.749 --> 10:51.483
<i> [chris] martin mason,</i>
<i>  on a scale of one to ten,</i>

10:51.485 --> 10:53.118
<i>  how pumped are you right now?</i>

10:53.120 --> 10:58.023
Let me tell you what.
The scale right now
goes to 11!

10:58.025 --> 11:00.759
-Oh, yeah!
-[chris laughs]

11:01.928 --> 11:05.363
martin, martin, take
us through that fight, man.

11:05.365 --> 11:06.631
You know what?

11:06.633 --> 11:08.667
This was a little bit
strategic for us.

11:08.669 --> 11:10.669
You saw us both
go at each other.

11:10.671 --> 11:14.205
But you know what? We wanted
to make sure the box
is a little bit smaller.

11:14.207 --> 11:15.640
Calvin made a little twist

11:15.642 --> 11:17.342
that let us get to full speed.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.511
You know what? And from
there, we had it.

11:19.513 --> 11:20.779
<i>  Let me tell you what, folks?</i>

11:20.781 --> 11:22.647
They come from the alpine,

11:22.649 --> 11:25.617
but we brought the al-pain!

11:25.619 --> 11:27.819
Oh, yeah!

11:27.821 --> 11:29.854
[audience cheering]

11:31.058 --> 11:34.993
martin, is a giant nut
in this team's future?

11:34.995 --> 11:36.628
Let me tell you
what's going to happen.

11:36.630 --> 11:39.964
We're going to
claw our way up
through this competition,

11:39.966 --> 11:44.803
one step at a time, until
we get to the top.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.939
Martin mason, team
madcatter, congratulations.

11:47.941 --> 11:54.245
Whoo! Yeah! Yeah! Whoo!

11:54.247 --> 11:57.182
[audience cheering]

11:57.184 --> 12:00.218
<i> [chris] so madcatter comes</i>
<i>  out foaming at the mouth</i>

12:00.220 --> 12:03.054
<i>  and starts its season</i>
<i>  off with a win,</i>

12:03.056 --> 12:06.558
<i>  while yeti gets put on</i>
<i>  ice in its return to action.</i>

12:08.061 --> 12:10.595
<i>  We are just getting</i>
<i>  started with a fight card</i>

12:10.597 --> 12:12.664
<i>  chock-full of heavy hitters.</i>

12:12.666 --> 12:15.967
<i>  Up next, a battlebots'</i>
<i>  rookie makes its debut,</i>

12:15.969 --> 12:18.403
<i>  as jason vasquez's defender</i>

12:18.405 --> 12:22.273
<i>  throws down with the most</i>
<i>  furious frog on the planet,</i>

12:22.275 --> 12:23.441
<i>  ribbot!</i>

12:23.443 --> 12:25.877
<i>  Don't go anywhere.</i>

12:33.019 --> 12:35.687
We continue on here
on battlebots.

12:35.689 --> 12:37.255
[chris]
<i>  in tonight's main event,</i>

12:37.257 --> 12:41.226
<i>  we'll see whiplash and</i>
<i>  captain matty vasquez</i>
<i>  enter the arena.</i>

12:41.228 --> 12:44.863
<i>  But right now, it's all</i>
<i>  about younger bro, jason,</i>

12:44.865 --> 12:47.298
<i>  as he makes his</i>
<i>  battlebots debut</i>

12:47.300 --> 12:52.403
<i>  against david jin</i>
<i> and his fearsome frog, ribbot.</i>

12:52.405 --> 12:56.007
<i>  Jason's been a critical</i>
<i>  part of team whiplash</i>
<i>  over the years,</i>

12:56.009 --> 13:01.112
<i> helping that robot make it all</i>
<i>  the way to the championship</i>
<i>  match just last season.</i>

13:01.114 --> 13:03.581
<i>  And while we've always</i>
<i>  seen the older brother,</i>

13:03.583 --> 13:06.017
<i>  matt vasquez, with the</i>
<i>  controller in hand,</i>

13:06.019 --> 13:08.486
<i>  jason has been building</i>
<i>  and fighting robots</i>

13:08.488 --> 13:10.722
<i>  for nearly the same</i>
<i>  amount of time.</i>

13:10.724 --> 13:14.225
<i>  And this season, he finally</i>
<i>  decided to spread his wings</i>

13:14.227 --> 13:17.495
<i>  and become the captain of</i>
<i>  his own robot, defender.</i>

13:17.497 --> 13:19.264
That's right. Listen,
he wanted more action.

13:19.266 --> 13:21.633
-Yep.
-He's a tremendous
driver in his own right,

13:21.635 --> 13:25.770
but it really takes some
cojones to step away from
a title contender, chris.

13:25.772 --> 13:26.905
<i>  Not to mention,</i>

13:26.907 --> 13:29.174
<i>  building the type of</i>
<i>  robot jason did,</i>

13:29.176 --> 13:31.709
<i>  defender is</i>
<i>  a defensive control bot,</i>

13:31.711 --> 13:34.946
<i>  which is a risky design in</i>
<i>  a damaged-based sport.</i>

13:34.948 --> 13:37.982
<i>  Tonight's going to be a big</i>
<i> first test for the 19-year-old</i>

13:37.984 --> 13:40.218
<i>  against an incredibly</i>
<i>  dangerous vertical spinner.</i>

13:41.488 --> 13:44.222
<i> [chris] that's right, his</i>
<i>  opponent tonight is ribbot,</i>

13:44.224 --> 13:45.723
<i>  led by david jin,</i>

13:45.725 --> 13:48.626
<i>  and what a remarkable</i>
<i>  run they had in 2020,</i>

13:48.628 --> 13:50.328
<i>  all the way</i>
<i>  to the quarterfinals.</i>

13:50.330 --> 13:54.299
<i>  Can they repeat that and even</i>
<i> better their finish this year?</i>

13:54.301 --> 13:56.568
They always surprise
us every single season.

13:56.570 --> 13:57.869
They're a tremendous team,

13:57.871 --> 13:59.871
and they've matured,
50% of their team are

13:59.873 --> 14:03.808
still at wpi, 50% are out in
the real world with real jobs.

14:03.810 --> 14:05.510
<i>  He said building this new bot</i>

14:05.512 --> 14:08.179
<i>  was very difficult because</i>
<i>  of that situation,</i>

14:08.181 --> 14:10.081
<i>  but they like to</i>
<i>  be underestimated.</i>

14:10.083 --> 14:13.284
<i>  So don't be surprised</i>
<i>  if they go out there</i>
<i>  and have a tremendous bot.</i>

14:13.286 --> 14:14.752
By the way, is this
a real job or no?

14:14.754 --> 14:16.154
-Yeah, of course it is.
-It is?

14:16.156 --> 14:18.223
-Of course, it is, yes.
-Oh, it's not that tough.

14:18.225 --> 14:20.425

14:26.633 --> 14:30.301

14:53.693 --> 14:55.159
<i>  in the manning family.</i>

14:55.161 --> 14:57.695
<i> [kenny] yeah, and defender</i>
<i>  has huge front forks.</i>

14:57.697 --> 14:59.831
<i>  It'll try to use those</i>
<i>  to scoop up ribbot</i>

14:59.833 --> 15:02.533
<i>  and then clamp down with</i>
<i>  that big arm in the middle.</i>

15:02.535 --> 15:04.402
<i>  Jason's going to</i>
<i>  need to ram ribbot</i>

15:04.404 --> 15:07.171
<i>  into the screws and get</i>
<i>  it onto the upper deck</i>

15:16.750 --> 15:19.617
the only frog that'll
make you croak,

15:19.619 --> 15:21.886
it's ribbot!

15:27.427 --> 15:28.993
<i> [chris] team ribbot,</i>

15:28.995 --> 15:33.698
<i>  last year, a defining win</i>
<i>  in the round of</i>
<i>  16 against uppercut.</i>

15:33.700 --> 15:35.199
<i>  Let's see if this team</i>

15:35.201 --> 15:38.102
<i>  has the ability to</i>
<i>  take another step, kenny.</i>

15:38.104 --> 15:40.738
<i> [kenny] yeah, going with the</i>
<i>  vertical disc for this fight,</i>

15:40.740 --> 15:44.943
<i>  but they did switch to</i>
<i>  brushless weapon motors</i>
<i>  during the offseason.</i>

15:44.945 --> 15:46.644
<i>  That's what uppercut uses.</i>

15:46.646 --> 15:49.781
<i>  They have a much greater</i>
<i>  power to weight ratio,</i>

15:49.783 --> 15:51.416
<i>  but they're less reliable.</i>

15:51.418 --> 15:55.286
<i>  So this upgrade is a bit of a</i>
<i>  gamble, but we are in vegas.</i>

15:57.324 --> 15:59.223
[audience cheering]

16:01.428 --> 16:03.394
<i>  I'm feeling pretty confident</i>
<i>  about this first fight.</i>

16:03.396 --> 16:04.929
<i>  We got a pretty good matchup.</i>

16:04.931 --> 16:07.966
<i>  I think our ground game is</i>
<i> a little bit better than them.</i>

16:07.968 --> 16:10.101
<i>  So hopefully we can</i>
<i>  just control the match</i>

16:10.103 --> 16:12.437
<i>  and keep them in the air</i>
<i>  and run them into stuff.</i>

16:12.439 --> 16:15.606
<i>  It's a little weird being</i>
<i>  separated from my brother,</i>

16:15.608 --> 16:17.542
<i> but I think it's for the best,</i>

16:17.544 --> 16:20.144
<i>  and it's giving</i>
<i>  me room to grow.</i>

16:20.146 --> 16:22.280
<i>  And I fought before and</i>
<i>  I'm ready to fight again.</i>

16:22.282 --> 16:23.581
<i>  For our fight</i>
<i>  against defender,</i>

16:23.583 --> 16:25.249
<i>  we decided to go with</i>
<i>  our vertical spinner</i>

16:25.251 --> 16:26.784
<i>  because we believe</i>
<i>  that our wedgelets</i>

16:26.786 --> 16:28.319
<i>  will be able to</i>
<i>  get under theirs.</i>

16:28.321 --> 16:29.654
<i>  Whereas if we ran</i>
<i>  the undercutter,</i>

16:29.656 --> 16:31.289
<i>  we'd have to beat</i>
<i>  their giant plough.</i>

16:31.291 --> 16:32.924
<i>  And we took a look at</i>
<i>  it before the match.</i>

16:32.926 --> 16:34.459
<i>  And that thing is</i>
<i>  built really well,</i>

16:34.461 --> 16:36.995
<i>  and we have</i>
<i>  no confidence that we'll be</i>
<i>  able to get through it.</i>

16:36.997 --> 16:38.096
<i> We're super excited to take on</i>

<i>  came out on the offensive</i>
<i>  to start off the fight.</i>

<i> [kenny] it sure did, and those</i>

<i>  did their job and got</i>

19:08.615 --> 19:12.016
<i>  It looked like defender was</i>
<i>  going to keep</i>
<i>  ribbot on the outside,</i>

<i>  but eventually david jin</i>
<i>  found an opening,</i>

<i>  as mammoth is</i>
<i>  taking on hijinx.</i>

19:38.444 --> 19:39.777
<i>  And later tonight,</i>

19:39.779 --> 19:42.914
<i>  it's the return of rusty</i>
<i>  and dave eaton,</i>

19:42.916 --> 19:48.019
<i>  who in his rookie season took</i>
<i> the battlebots world by storm.</i>

19:48.021 --> 19:50.388
<i> [chris] that bot is tough.</i>

19:50.390 --> 19:52.123
<i> [dave] the return of</i>
<i>  rusty for revenge.</i>

20:03.102 --> 20:06.938
We are back on
battlebots. And up next, are
you ready for some excitement?

20:06.940 --> 20:08.206
<i>  Well, you better be</i>

20:08.208 --> 20:09.473
<i>  because ricky willems</i>

20:09.475 --> 20:12.143
<i>  is moments away</i>
<i>  from marching mammoth,</i>

20:12.145 --> 20:14.946
<i>  the biggest robot</i>
<i>  in the competition</i>

20:14.948 --> 20:16.647
<i>  back into the box.</i>

20:16.649 --> 20:19.917
<i>  Now, everybody loves a unique</i>
<i>  design here at battlebots,</i>

20:19.919 --> 20:22.486
<i>  but builders like ricky</i>
<i>  aren't breaking the mold</i>

20:22.488 --> 20:24.222
<i>  just to put on a show.</i>

20:26.993 --> 20:29.227
I think most people want
to see something exciting,

20:29.229 --> 20:31.062
and they want to see
something unpredictable.

20:31.064 --> 20:34.498
And the weirder your
robot design is,

20:34.500 --> 20:36.467
the more you dial
that up to a left.

20:36.469 --> 20:39.971
<i> [chris] now you look at this</i>
<i>  bot, it's unlike anything</i>
<i>  we've ever seen before.</i>

20:39.973 --> 20:42.607
I think it's awesome to try to
bring about change
in the field

20:42.609 --> 20:44.008
by building something special.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.776
<i>  A lot of people try to</i>
<i>  step outside the boundaries</i>

20:45.778 --> 20:47.712
<i>  because they want to find</i>
<i>  a hole in the competition.</i>

20:47.714 --> 20:49.247
<i>  They want to find a</i>
<i>  way they can win,</i>

20:49.249 --> 20:50.681
<i>  the robots haven't</i>
<i>  figured out yet.</i>

20:50.683 --> 20:53.451
<i> [chris] unbelievable!</i>
<i>  What a shot by</i>
<i>  smeeeeeeeeeeeee!</i>

20:55.054 --> 20:57.421
You're starting to see a lot
of new designs coming in.

20:57.423 --> 20:58.856
They're pretty
unique like blip.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.191
Switchback is pretty neat.

21:00.193 --> 21:02.260
Fusion is way
up there for me

21:02.262 --> 21:04.395
not only be a vertical

21:04.397 --> 21:05.963
and a horizontal robot.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.698
<i>  I mean, those are tough</i>
<i>  things to pull off.</i>

21:07.700 --> 21:10.835
<i> [chris] it's the first of its</i>
<i>  kind in battlebots' history.</i>

21:10.837 --> 21:12.136
<i> [kenny] oh!</i>

21:12.138 --> 21:14.272
[chris]
<i>  fusion rips a chunk outta</i>
<i>  madcatter,</i>

21:14.274 --> 21:16.507
<i>  going right into</i>
<i>  the cat's meow.</i>

21:16.509 --> 21:18.442
[ricky] on the one hand, we
have a lot of new designs

21:18.444 --> 21:19.744
coming out in battlebots,

21:19.746 --> 21:22.380
but on the other hand,
the competitive "metagame"

21:22.382 --> 21:24.915
is getting more and more
narrow as time goes along.

21:24.917 --> 21:27.718
<i>  I mean, it's really focusing</i>
<i>  down on four-wheel drive,</i>

21:27.720 --> 21:30.121
<i>  vertical spinners with</i>
<i>  wedgelets at the front.</i>

21:30.123 --> 21:33.190
Trouble for them is,
is it more narrow

21:33.192 --> 21:35.192
that... That metal becomes,

21:35.194 --> 21:37.862
the easier it is for someone
to come along and disrupt it.

21:39.132 --> 21:41.399
<i> [chris] oh! Look at</i>
<i>  that shot.</i>

21:41.401 --> 21:43.167
<i>  Bite force has to</i>
<i>  be careful.</i>

21:43.169 --> 21:45.670
<i>  We know huge has</i>
<i>  knock-out ability.</i>

21:45.672 --> 21:47.171
[jonathan] a lot of
the robots here are all

21:47.173 --> 21:48.539
based on getting
under somebody.

21:48.541 --> 21:49.840
If they get under you, they
win.

21:49.842 --> 21:51.309
If they don't get
under you, they lose.

21:51.311 --> 21:55.179
[audience cheering]

21:55.181 --> 21:57.148
it's hard to beat them
at their own game,

21:57.150 --> 21:59.884
but they're not going to see
it coming if I try something

21:59.886 --> 22:01.485
they have no experience with.

22:01.487 --> 22:02.887
<i> [chris] mammoth on the attack.</i>

22:02.889 --> 22:05.823
<i> [kenny] and landed another</i>
<i>  blow. How about mammoth?</i>

22:05.825 --> 22:08.326
<i> [chris] oh, my goodness!</i>

22:08.328 --> 22:09.393
<i>  Wow!</i>

22:10.563 --> 22:13.664
There's more people
coming who you won't see

22:13.666 --> 22:14.932
until they're there.

22:14.934 --> 22:17.468
<i> [donald] it's a type of robot</i>
<i>  darwinism that's going on.</i>

22:17.470 --> 22:19.937
They're evolving based
on what they see.

22:19.939 --> 22:22.273
<i> [marc] the robot that won</i>
<i>  last year or this year</i>

22:22.275 --> 22:24.475
<i>  may not be the design</i>
<i>  that wins next year.</i>

22:24.477 --> 22:25.643
It's going to
be something that

22:25.645 --> 22:26.777
catches everybody off guard.

22:26.779 --> 22:28.112
<i> [ricky] I know we're going</i>
<i>  to see that.</i>

22:28.114 --> 22:30.881
That's going to happen
in battlebots near future,

22:30.883 --> 22:32.983
and we're not going to be able
to know until it comes along

22:32.985 --> 22:34.885
and surprises us all
in the battlebots.

22:34.887 --> 22:36.654
<i> [chris] whoa-ho! Look</i>
<i>  at that move!</i>

22:36.656 --> 22:39.423
<i>  -Whoa!</i>
<i> -[kenny] this fight</i>
<i>  was ridiculous.</i>

22:39.425 --> 22:42.093
[jonathan] we let the meta do
what it does for other people,

22:42.095 --> 22:43.728
but we always
need to stay here

22:43.730 --> 22:44.895
and kind of stake
our claim in it

22:44.897 --> 22:47.865
that if you sleep on us,
we're going to wreck you.

22:52.772 --> 22:55.139
<i> [chris] they say fortune</i>
<i>  favors the bold, kenny,</i>

22:55.141 --> 22:58.843
<i>  and ricky willems is</i>
<i>  clearly one of the boldest.</i>

22:58.845 --> 23:01.345
[kenny] absolutely. He's so
passionate about what he does,

23:01.347 --> 23:04.982
and, you know, his robot is
so unique, it's so unorthodox

23:04.984 --> 23:06.684
and he's going against hijinx,

23:06.686 --> 23:09.787
the largest horizontal
spinner in the competition.

23:09.789 --> 23:13.624
<i>  We've got ourselves</i>
<i>  a real clash of the titans</i>
<i>  here, chris.</i>

23:13.626 --> 23:15.960
You ready for some
fun and some energy?

23:15.962 --> 23:18.129
Let's take you inside the box.
But first,

23:18.131 --> 23:19.263
our man, faruq.

23:19.265 --> 23:22.800
[audience cheering
and applauding]

23:23.836 --> 23:25.836
[faruq] in the red square,

23:25.838 --> 23:27.605
from oakland, california,

23:27.607 --> 23:31.842
this '80s themed robot will
leave you pretty instinct.

23:31.844 --> 23:34.245
It's hijinx!

23:34.247 --> 23:37.515
[audience cheering]

23:38.818 --> 23:41.185
<i> [chris] hijinx's one of</i>
<i>  three rookie bots</i>

23:41.187 --> 23:42.887
<i>  to make</i>
<i>  the tournament last year,</i>

23:42.889 --> 23:45.222
<i>  captained by</i>
<i>  jen herchenroeder.</i>

23:45.224 --> 23:46.624
<i>  Kenny, it's deadly,</i>

23:46.659 --> 23:49.994
<i>  but this might be</i>
<i>  the most beautiful bot</i>
<i>  in the competition.</i>

23:49.996 --> 23:52.096
<i>  Sorry about that hyper shot.</i>

23:52.098 --> 23:53.931
<i> [kenny] yeah, and jen</i>
<i>  was an art major</i>

23:53.933 --> 23:55.566
<i> at the university of maryland,</i>

23:55.568 --> 23:57.201
<i>  so no surprise there.</i>

23:57.203 --> 24:00.137
<i>  And on the inside,</i>
<i>  it's an entirely new bot.</i>

24:00.139 --> 24:02.640
<i>  Everything, including</i>
<i>  the speed controller,</i>

24:02.642 --> 24:06.243
<i>  has been upgraded</i>
<i>  so that 68-pound blade</i>

24:06.245 --> 24:09.513
<i>  can now hit its top speed</i>
<i>  in less than five seconds.</i>

24:11.517 --> 24:13.250
[faruq] in the blue square,

24:13.252 --> 24:15.119
from baltimore, maryland,

24:15.121 --> 24:16.654
the prehistoric bully

24:16.656 --> 24:18.956
that is as bad as it is wooly,

24:18.958 --> 24:21.058
it's mammoth.

24:21.060 --> 24:23.093
[audience cheering]

24:25.398 --> 24:28.399
<i> [chris] watch out, pardon me,</i>
<i>  excuse me, big boy</i>
<i>  coming through.</i>

24:28.401 --> 24:29.800
<i>  Mammoth had that epic</i>

24:29.802 --> 24:32.269
<i>  upset over copperhead</i>
<i>  in the tournament last year,</i>

24:32.271 --> 24:35.206
<i>  but ricky's bot is looking</i>
<i>  a little different now,</i>

24:35.208 --> 24:36.807
<i>  kenny. Don't you think?</i>

24:36.809 --> 24:41.011
<i> [kenny] yeah, it went</i>
<i> from 6'4" to 5'6" this season.</i>

24:41.013 --> 24:43.881
<i> Still about the height of your</i>
<i>  typical refrigerator, though,</i>

24:43.883 --> 24:45.683
<i>  and that weapon</i>
<i>  is certainly different.</i>

24:45.685 --> 24:48.152
<i>  It's made of</i>
<i>  high-density plastic,</i>

24:48.154 --> 24:50.654
<i>  that same stuff huge's</i>
<i>  wheels are made from,</i>

24:50.656 --> 24:53.591
<i>  which should bend but</i>
<i>  not break against hijinx.</i>

24:57.563 --> 24:59.029
<i>  We're facing hijinx tonight.</i>

24:59.031 --> 25:01.332
<i>  What I think they're going</i>
<i>  to do is go after our wheels.</i>

25:01.334 --> 25:02.566
<i>  It's up to me as a driver</i>

25:02.568 --> 25:04.235
<i>  to make</i>
<i> sure that they cannot do that.</i>

25:04.237 --> 25:05.769
<i>  I never learned</i>
<i>  my lesson here.</i>

25:05.771 --> 25:08.439
<i>  And again, the robot is</i>
<i>  completely different.</i>

25:08.441 --> 25:10.508
<i>  The biggest thing is</i>
<i>  we've got this new weapon.</i>

25:10.510 --> 25:12.443
<i>  I'm super excited for</i>
<i>  hijinx to fight it.</i>

25:12.445 --> 25:14.144
<i> It's floppy in this direction.</i>

25:14.146 --> 25:15.412
<i>  They can keep hitting</i>
<i>  it and it just</i>

25:15.414 --> 25:16.914
<i>  springs out of the way.</i>

25:16.916 --> 25:19.483
<i>  But it's strong in the other</i>
<i>  direction and we can</i>
<i>  throw them out.</i>

25:19.485 --> 25:24.054
<i>  Mammoth is a very large,</i>
<i>  vertical flip spinner.</i>

25:24.056 --> 25:25.789
<i>  The very shape of</i>
<i>  our armor is sloped</i>

25:25.791 --> 25:27.358
<i>  upward on front and back</i>

25:27.360 --> 25:30.094
<i>  that makes it much more</i>
<i>  difficult for</i>
<i>  a vertical spinner</i>

25:30.096 --> 25:31.896
<i>  to get a good purchase</i>
<i>  under the robot</i>

25:31.898 --> 25:33.430
<i>  to find a place to lift.</i>

25:33.432 --> 25:35.633
<i>  They're more likely to</i>
<i>  hit the front of the armor</i>

25:35.635 --> 25:37.067
<i>  and be deflected off.</i>

25:37.069 --> 25:39.537
<i>  Mammoth is huge,</i>

25:39.539 --> 25:40.738
<i>  but they beat huge.</i>

25:40.740 --> 25:42.773
<i>  So we have to take</i>
<i>  the fight very seriously.</i>

25:45.444 --> 25:46.944
[automated voice]
<i>  robots, activate.</i>

25:50.449 --> 25:52.650
<i> [chris] kenny, hijinx looking</i>
<i>  kind of vicious.</i>

25:52.652 --> 25:54.985
<i> [kenny] jen said that</i>
<i>  thing is built like a tank,</i>

25:54.987 --> 25:56.954
<i>  and they are</i>
<i>  incredibly confident</i>

25:56.956 --> 25:59.490
<i>  in the skills of</i>
<i>  driver/designer</i>

25:59.492 --> 26:02.960
<i>  orion beach, with the</i>
<i>  controller in his</i>
<i>  hands, chris.</i>

26:02.962 --> 26:05.229
<i> [chris] and another big</i>
<i>  upgrade from mammoth,</i>

26:05.231 --> 26:07.698
they've gone from one
weapon chain to two.

26:07.700 --> 26:11.802
<i> Last season, that single chain</i>
<i>  left them awfully vulnerable,</i>

26:11.804 --> 26:14.805
<i> but now they're twice as nice,</i>

26:14.807 --> 26:17.374
or as we like to say,
two chains.

26:32.692 --> 26:34.191
And I think you want
the weapon here

26:34.193 --> 26:36.427
-before we make contact.
-Yes.

26:39.498 --> 26:41.832
<i> [chris] let the bot</i>
<i>  battle begin.</i>

26:41.834 --> 26:43.367
<i>  Mammoth with a fox rush,</i>

26:43.369 --> 26:46.270
<i>  trying to prevent</i>
<i>  hijinx with spin it up.</i>

26:46.272 --> 26:47.905
<i>  Hijinx retreats,</i>

26:47.907 --> 26:50.407
<i>  looking for some space.</i>

26:50.409 --> 26:52.209
<i>  Oh!</i>

26:52.211 --> 26:57.615
<i> [kenny] mammoth is all over</i>
<i>  hijinx here, impressive</i>
<i>  mobility from that giant bot.</i>

26:57.617 --> 27:00.784
<i> [chris] now, bullying hijinx</i>
<i>  into that short corner.</i>

27:00.786 --> 27:03.787
<i>  Hijinx pushing back,</i>
<i>  the bots locking horns,</i>

27:03.789 --> 27:05.723
<i>  preventing one another</i>
<i>  from spinning up.</i>

27:05.725 --> 27:09.226
<i>  We got a good</i>
<i>  old-fashioned standoff here.</i>

27:09.228 --> 27:12.663
<i> [kenny] hijinx has to find</i>
<i>  a way to get out of</i>
<i>  that corner, chris.</i>

27:12.665 --> 27:15.499
<i> [chris] now, we've got</i>
<i>  some movement from</i>
<i>  these two spinners.</i>

27:17.236 --> 27:19.136
<i>  Oh!</i>

27:19.138 --> 27:21.972
<i>  Mammoth puts hijinx</i>
<i>  into the screws.</i>

27:21.974 --> 27:24.375
<i> [kenny] uh-oh.</i>
<i>  They lost a wheel.</i>

27:24.377 --> 27:25.609
<i> [chris] oh, my gosh!</i>

27:25.611 --> 27:27.711
<i> [kenny] and hijinx only</i>
<i>  has two of them.</i>

27:27.713 --> 27:28.979
Yeah!

27:28.981 --> 27:30.748
<i> [chris] now, listen</i>
<i>  to ricky willems.</i>

27:30.750 --> 27:33.150
-You want another hit?
<i> -[chris] wow!</i>

27:33.152 --> 27:35.519
<i>  Hijinx's blade is</i>
<i>  still in the game,,</i>

27:35.521 --> 27:37.988
<i>  but here comes the countdown.</i>

27:37.990 --> 27:41.358
[referee] ...Eight,
seven, six...

27:41.360 --> 27:44.061
<i> [chris] their driver, orion</i>
<i>  beach, having some kind of</i>

27:44.063 --> 27:45.729
<i>  movement and, oh!</i>

27:45.731 --> 27:50.701
[referee] ...Three, two, one.
That's a knockout.
Winner is mammoth.

27:50.703 --> 27:52.336
<i> [chris] he cannot.</i>

27:59.078 --> 28:04.748
<i>  Ricky willes and mammoth</i>
<i>  out of the box in</i>
<i>  a hurry here in 2021!</i>

28:07.753 --> 28:10.721
<i>  Kenny, mammoth</i>
<i>  just did an amazing job</i>

28:10.723 --> 28:13.123
<i>  being on top of its</i>
<i>  opponent all fight long.</i>

28:13.125 --> 28:15.559
<i> [kenny] absolutely.</i>
<i>  Mammoth used its size</i>

28:15.561 --> 28:18.195
<i>  to back hijinx into one of</i>
<i>  the new short corners</i>

28:18.197 --> 28:20.164
<i>  created by the upper deck,</i>

28:20.166 --> 28:21.598
<i>  and it used that corner</i>

28:21.600 --> 28:23.300
<i>  to help it do its dirty work.</i>

28:23.302 --> 28:25.536
<i>  That strike right there</i>
<i>  flipped hijinx.</i>

28:25.538 --> 28:27.337
<i> It lost one of its two wheels,</i>

28:27.339 --> 28:29.339
<i>  and that was game over.</i>

28:29.341 --> 28:31.875
<i>  Mammoth is going to be</i>
<i>  fun to watch this season.</i>

28:34.547 --> 28:36.780
-Huh!
-[chris] ricky.

28:36.782 --> 28:38.182
Are you okay, buddy?

28:38.184 --> 28:39.917
No. Well, I mean,

28:39.919 --> 28:41.452
I guess I'm better than them.

28:41.454 --> 28:43.253
[all laughing]

28:43.255 --> 28:46.356
<i> -[kenny] you're just digging</i>
<i>  yourself deeper, buddy.</i>
<i> -I... I know, I...</i>

28:46.358 --> 28:48.559
It's been a long,
long road to get here.

28:48.561 --> 28:49.693
We've screwed it
up last night.

28:49.695 --> 28:51.662
We built the robot up twice,

28:51.664 --> 28:53.363
including last night
and midnight.

28:53.365 --> 28:54.765
It's amazing just to
get in the box

28:54.767 --> 28:56.767
and the fact that we survived.

28:56.769 --> 28:58.435
I'm still on edge.
I'm still shaking.

28:58.437 --> 29:01.505
With... With all that that
happened, what does this do
for your morale as a team,

29:01.507 --> 29:03.941
knowing that you can deal
with this kind of adversity?

29:03.943 --> 29:05.876
Oh, it... I mean, it just

29:05.878 --> 29:07.544
galvanizes my faith

29:07.546 --> 29:10.380
in everybody on this team.
They've all worked so hard

29:10.382 --> 29:12.449
and just put in the
hours and the effort

29:12.451 --> 29:14.151
and the, the heart,

29:14.153 --> 29:16.320
and I'm just so
thrilled, a third year

29:16.322 --> 29:18.522
with a win in our first fight.

29:18.524 --> 29:21.058
Congratulations, ricky willems
and team mammoth.

29:21.060 --> 29:23.327
[audience cheering]

29:26.999 --> 29:28.265
<i> [chris] okay, folks,</i>

29:28.267 --> 29:32.169
<i> team mammoth kicks off another</i>
<i>  season with a record of 1-0.</i>

29:32.171 --> 29:33.670
<i>  Are they primed to</i>
<i>  make a deep run</i>

29:33.672 --> 29:36.740
<i>  this year with that weird</i>
<i>  and wonderful robot?</i>

29:38.177 --> 29:41.278
<i>  Coming up, the crusher</i>
<i>  bot from the deep,</i>

29:41.280 --> 29:43.447
<i>  kraken will try and</i>
<i>  sink its teeth</i>

29:43.449 --> 29:47.117
<i>  into the always</i>
<i>  hard-to-kill, rotator.</i>

29:47.119 --> 29:48.619
<i>  And don't forget</i>
<i>  about tonight's</i>

29:48.621 --> 29:50.287
<i>  blockbuster main event,</i>

29:50.289 --> 29:52.055
<i>  where the tri-bar terror,</i>

29:52.057 --> 29:55.793
<i>  bloodsport, will square off</i>
<i>  with last season's runner-up,</i>

29:55.795 --> 29:57.261
<i>  whiplash.</i>

29:57.263 --> 29:59.429
<i>  Its driver, matty vasquez,</i>

29:59.431 --> 30:01.899
<i>  he's a man on a mission.</i>

30:01.901 --> 30:03.300
<i> [matthew] I have never</i>
<i>  actually said that</i>

30:03.302 --> 30:04.735
<i>  this will be our year</i>
<i>  to win the nut.</i>

30:04.737 --> 30:07.437
This season, I think it is our
year to win the nut.

30:15.381 --> 30:17.548
We are back on battlebots,
and up next,

30:17.550 --> 30:19.016
<i>  a fight you can</i>
<i>  definitely sink your</i>

30:19.018 --> 30:20.818
<i>  teeth into, because kraken</i>

30:20.820 --> 30:23.153
<i>  is going to try and take a</i>
<i>  bite out of one of the most</i>

30:23.155 --> 30:26.089
<i>  kinetic bots here, rotator.</i>

30:27.193 --> 30:29.993
<i> [chris] but let's start with</i>
<i>  the sea monster.</i>

30:29.995 --> 30:32.062
<i>  Captained by matt spurk,</i>
<i>  and I love it.</i>

30:32.064 --> 30:33.130
<i>  The entire family,</i>

30:33.132 --> 30:35.065
<i>  they get dressed up in</i>
<i>  the pirates garb.</i>

30:35.067 --> 30:39.069
<i>  They get into it, and</i>
<i>  kraken with that crusher,</i>

30:39.071 --> 30:41.004
<i>  big-time devastation.</i>

30:41.006 --> 30:42.639
<i>  This year, they've</i>
<i>  upped the ante.</i>

30:42.641 --> 30:43.807
Yeah, that's right. It's even

30:43.809 --> 30:45.642
more powerful this season.

30:45.644 --> 30:47.211
And, you know, I was really

30:47.213 --> 30:48.312
impressed with the
advancements

30:48.314 --> 30:50.347
that they had in
their robot last season.

30:50.349 --> 30:51.748
[kenny]
<i>  they didn't have</i>
<i>  the best record,</i>

30:51.750 --> 30:53.517
<i>  but I thought they</i>
<i>  were always exciting.</i>

30:53.519 --> 30:54.618
<i>  They were aggressive.</i>

30:54.620 --> 30:56.086
<i>  I thought they were</i>
<i>  one of those candidates</i>

30:56.088 --> 30:57.221
<i>  for most improved bot.</i>

30:57.223 --> 30:59.323
<i>  So I'm excited to see</i>
<i>  what they've got.</i>

30:59.325 --> 31:01.992
And it'll be facing
off against rotator

31:01.994 --> 31:03.627
and victor soto,
one of the smartest

31:03.629 --> 31:05.362
guys working back in the pits.

31:05.364 --> 31:06.597
<i> [chris] last season,</i>

31:06.599 --> 31:08.365
<i>  it ended in the round of 16,</i>

31:08.367 --> 31:10.601
<i>  lost a split decision</i>
<i>  to the eventual</i>

31:10.603 --> 31:12.369
<i>  champion, end game.</i>
<i>  And he said</i>

31:12.371 --> 31:15.305
<i>  he talked to nick mabey and</i>
<i>  jack barker of end game</i>

31:15.307 --> 31:16.473
<i>  afterward and they said,</i>

31:16.508 --> 31:18.308
<i>  "hey, look at all the damage</i>
<i>  you did to our robot,</i>

31:18.310 --> 31:21.078
<i>  here and here and here."</i>
<i>  and victor was like,</i>

31:21.080 --> 31:22.479
"wait a second, if I did
so much damage,

31:22.481 --> 31:25.382
why did I lose the fight
and went home early?"

31:25.384 --> 31:27.251
<i>  listen, victor,</i>
<i>  I think, is a team</i>

31:27.253 --> 31:29.486
<i>  to watch with rotator.</i>
<i>  There's no question about it.</i>

31:29.488 --> 31:31.688
<i> [kenny] and I kind of feel</i>
<i>  like he's due for a</i>
<i>  breakthrough.</i>

31:31.690 --> 31:33.357
<i> -[chris] yeah.</i>
<i> -[kenny]</i>
<i>  because he's always been</i>

31:33.359 --> 31:34.458
<i>  right there on the cusp.</i>

31:34.460 --> 31:36.627
<i>  Last year, rotator took</i>
<i>  down legendary bot</i>

31:36.629 --> 31:38.228
<i>  bronco in the</i>
<i>  championship match</i>

31:38.230 --> 31:39.296
<i>  of their bounty tournament.</i>

31:39.298 --> 31:41.198
<i>  But one thing</i>
<i>  victor's never done</i>

31:41.200 --> 31:43.400
<i>  is win his first</i>
<i>  fight of the season.</i>

31:43.402 --> 31:45.302
<i> Kraken is a tough bot to kill.</i>

31:45.404 --> 31:48.038
<i>  So could a win tonight be</i>
<i>  a sign of things to come?</i>

31:48.040 --> 31:49.172
<i>  Let's see.</i>

31:49.174 --> 31:50.908
Two parts of the florida bot

31:50.910 --> 31:52.342
mafia ready to square off

31:52.344 --> 31:55.045
inside the box.
Faruq, take it away.

31:58.284 --> 32:00.317
In the red square,

32:00.319 --> 32:02.252
crack is whack,

32:02.254 --> 32:03.754
that's where we should begin.

32:03.756 --> 32:05.822
But this team will
crack a bottle

32:05.824 --> 32:07.791
when they celebrate their win.

32:07.793 --> 32:09.860
This bot has
giant metal teeth

32:09.862 --> 32:11.595
that can break you in two.

32:11.597 --> 32:13.530
So if you ask him
what's cracking,

32:13.532 --> 32:16.133
it's probably you.

32:16.135 --> 32:19.036
Give it up for kraken!

32:19.038 --> 32:21.071
[audience cheering]

32:24.576 --> 32:26.076
<i> [chris] that is so cute.</i>

32:26.078 --> 32:28.245
<i>  The whole family is</i>
<i>  back this season.</i>

32:28.247 --> 32:31.148
<i>  The kraken really earned</i>
<i>  its stripes last season,</i>

32:31.150 --> 32:32.950
<i>  kenny, going three</i>
<i>  minutes with</i>

32:32.952 --> 32:36.053
<i>  black dragon, with</i>
<i>  witch doctor with huge</i>

32:36.055 --> 32:39.189
<i> and with sawblaze. What a run!</i>

32:39.191 --> 32:41.425
<i> [kenny] yeah, this bot is</i>
<i>  as tough as they come, chris.</i>

32:41.427 --> 32:43.727
<i>  Kraken's teeth are even</i>
<i>  stronger this year,</i>

32:43.729 --> 32:45.028
<i>  and you can see they've</i>
<i>  gone from a</i>

32:45.030 --> 32:47.097
<i>  rounded shape to</i>
<i>  more of a blade,</i>

32:47.099 --> 32:48.565
<i>  and matthew spurk told us</i>

32:48.567 --> 32:50.867
<i>  he's not afraid to</i>
<i>  sink those daggers</i>

32:50.869 --> 32:52.336
<i>  straight into rotator,</i>

32:52.338 --> 32:54.604
<i>  even if it's running</i>
<i>  it's blade on top.</i>

32:54.606 --> 32:56.340
[audience cheering]

32:56.342 --> 32:58.442
[faruq] in the blue square,

32:58.444 --> 33:00.010
this bot has a rap sheet,

33:00.012 --> 33:01.845
a record. He's criminal.

33:01.847 --> 33:03.780
You're a goner,
is his message.

33:03.782 --> 33:04.848
It's overt

33:04.850 --> 33:06.616
and it's subliminal.

33:06.618 --> 33:08.018
He'll leave you with wounds

33:08.020 --> 33:09.853
and he'll leave
you with scars.

33:09.855 --> 33:11.855
So just pray that these rhymes

33:11.857 --> 33:14.458
put him behind bars.

33:14.460 --> 33:16.960
It's rotator!

33:16.962 --> 33:19.563
[audience cheering]

33:19.565 --> 33:21.398
<i> [chris] always love to see</i>
<i>  the get-up</i>

33:21.400 --> 33:23.433
<i>  with victor soto and rotator,</i>

33:23.435 --> 33:26.103
<i>  so flashy that they</i>
<i>  can definitely</i>

33:26.105 --> 33:27.504
<i>  back it up, kenny.</i>

33:27.506 --> 33:29.940
<i> [kenny] yeah, it's durable</i>
<i>  and destructive, chris,</i>

33:29.942 --> 33:31.875
<i>  and we talked about</i>
<i>  the brushless weapon</i>

33:31.877 --> 33:33.510
<i>  motors ribbot switched to.</i>

33:33.512 --> 33:36.546
<i>  Well, rotator did the same</i>
<i>  thing this offseason,</i>

33:36.548 --> 33:38.448
<i> so more power for less weight.</i>

33:38.450 --> 33:40.784
<i>  We'll see what that does</i>
<i>  to what was already</i>

33:40.786 --> 33:42.352
<i>  one of the baddest bots here.</i>

33:42.354 --> 33:44.354
[audience cheering]

33:52.698 --> 33:54.331
<i>  kraken is a very tough robot,</i>

33:54.333 --> 33:56.266
<i>  and I hear now that they're</i>
<i>  even more powerful</i>

33:56.268 --> 33:58.335
<i>  in terms of crushing force.</i>
<i>  We're going to actually</i>

33:58.337 --> 34:01.538
<i>  try to use the sport designs</i>
<i>  that we've had in the past,</i>

34:01.540 --> 34:03.306
<i>  but we've optimized them</i>

34:03.308 --> 34:04.674
<i>  so we can actually</i>

34:04.676 --> 34:07.110
<i>  use them to full efficiency,</i>
<i>  full potential</i>

34:07.112 --> 34:09.012
<i>  and push other robots around.</i>

34:09.014 --> 34:10.313
<i>  So I expect this to be a</i>

34:10.315 --> 34:13.050
<i>  three-minute match, but we're</i>
<i>  going to try to sink kraken.</i>

34:13.052 --> 34:14.818
<i>  We've increased</i>
<i>  the crushing power</i>

34:14.820 --> 34:16.920
<i>  from 60,000 pounds last year</i>

34:16.922 --> 34:19.222
<i>  to over 100,000</i>
<i>  pounds of force.</i>

34:19.224 --> 34:20.490
<i>  That's kind of like having</i>

34:20.492 --> 34:23.326
<i>  a humpback whale sitting on</i>
<i>  the front of kraken's mouth.</i>

34:23.328 --> 34:25.762
<i>  We've been scouting</i>
<i>  videos for rotator.</i>

34:25.764 --> 34:27.264
<i> We think he's going to run his</i>

34:27.266 --> 34:29.866
<i>  bar spinner on the top</i>
<i>  to try and protect...</i>

34:29.868 --> 34:31.768
<i>  Protect him from the</i>
<i>  teeth coming down.</i>

34:31.770 --> 34:33.270
<i>  The great thing about</i>
<i>  kraken is just</i>

34:33.272 --> 34:34.805
<i>  always the same strategy.</i>

34:34.807 --> 34:36.807
<i>  Attack as fast as possible,</i>

34:36.809 --> 34:38.542
<i>  blade as many times</i>
<i>  as possible,</i>

34:38.544 --> 34:40.143
<i>  and as soon as you</i>
<i>  get a hold of him,</i>

<i>  Oh, yeah, kraken trying to</i>

<i>  almost takes out</i>

35:58.223 --> 36:00.724
<i>  Rotator fires a warning shot.</i>

36:00.726 --> 36:03.894
<i>  Oh, and another. That</i>
<i>  horizontal blade of rotator,</i>

<i> [kenny] oh!</i>

36:07.065 --> 36:08.932
<i> [chris] oh! Trying to bite,</i>
<i>  he's got it.</i>

36:12.070 --> 36:13.937
<i>  Kraken has</i>
<i>  rotator in its jaws,</i>

36:13.939 --> 36:15.539
<i> and now it bursts into flames.</i>

36:15.541 --> 36:19.576
<i>  There's fire pouring</i>
<i>  out of the top of</i>
<i>  matthew spurk's bot!</i>

36:20.913 --> 36:21.945
<i> [kenny] ooh!</i>

36:21.947 --> 36:23.380
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

36:23.382 --> 36:26.016
<i> [chris] if you've never seen</i>
<i>  a mechanical sea monster</i>

<i>  at fire before,</i>
<i>  "hey, welcome to battlebots!"</i>

36:29.788 --> 36:31.955
<i>  kraken though not</i>
<i>  showing any signs of</i>

<i>  letting go of rotator, kenny.</i>

36:33.992 --> 36:35.325
<i>  What's going on?</i>

36:35.327 --> 36:37.861
<i> [kenny] no, but kraken just</i>
<i>  has to hold that fire,</i>

36:37.863 --> 36:41.531
<i>  doesn't fry anything</i>
<i>  vital inside the bot.</i>

36:41.533 --> 36:43.166
<i> [chris] okay, now,</i>
<i>  per the rulebook,</i>

36:43.168 --> 36:45.135
<i>  kraken will have to release</i>
<i>  rotator after 30 seconds.</i>

36:45.137 --> 36:47.103
-[referee] you got to start
releasing him.
-He's... He's

36:47.105 --> 36:48.471
released it, the jaw is
open either way.

36:48.473 --> 36:49.906
[referee] you got to
start releasing him.

36:49.908 --> 36:51.541
<i> [chris] the ref is issuing</i>
<i>  a warning,</i>

<i>  but I'm not so sure</i>
<i>  that matt spurk can get</i>

36:53.612 --> 36:56.580
<i>  kraken to shake</i>
<i>  rotator loose.</i>

36:56.582 --> 36:58.181
<i> [kenny] yeah, he looks</i>
<i>  pretty stuck on there.</i>

36:58.183 --> 37:00.050
<i> [chris] you got to release</i>
<i>  him, you got to release him.</i>

37:00.052 --> 37:02.519
He's already released.
He's stuck in the lower teeth
or stuck in the tire.

37:02.521 --> 37:04.821
<i> -[referee] you can't pull out,</i>
<i>  you're stuck?</i>
<i> -[kenny] wow!</i>

<i> [chris] here's what's</i>
<i>  happened. We officially</i>
<i>  have a stoppage</i>

37:15.934 --> 37:17.367
<i>  of this match.</i>

37:17.369 --> 37:20.737
<i>  Kenny, you're going to</i>
<i>  have to clean this up.</i>
<i>  Dial us in here.</i>

37:20.739 --> 37:22.005
<i> [kenny] well, chris, the</i>
<i>  crew bots</i>

37:22.007 --> 37:24.441
<i>  are going to try to</i>
<i>  dislodge rotator.</i>

37:24.443 --> 37:26.376
<i>  According to the rulebook,</i>

37:26.378 --> 37:28.511
<i>  if they can't</i>
<i>  separate these two,</i>

37:28.513 --> 37:30.080
<i>  this is going to the judges,</i>

37:30.082 --> 37:32.816
<i>  and rotator cannot</i>
<i>  afford for that to happen.</i>

37:32.818 --> 37:35.318
[victor] unstick.
Unstick. Unstick.

37:35.320 --> 37:38.088
<i> [chris] all right, we're going</i>
<i> to take a break, but something</i>
<i>  tells me,</i>

37:38.090 --> 37:40.523
<i>  carnage awaits</i>
<i>  on the other side.</i>

37:41.994 --> 37:46.329
<i> The fate of these bots will be</i>
<i>  decided when we return</i>

37:46.331 --> 37:48.865
<i>  on battlebots.</i>

37:56.575 --> 37:59.409
<i> [chris] welcome back to</i>
<i>  battlebots, where before</i>
<i>  the break,</i>

37:59.411 --> 38:02.545
<i>  we saw rotator and</i>
<i>  kraken become entangled</i>

38:02.547 --> 38:05.215
<i>  a little over a minute</i>
<i>  into their fight.</i>

38:05.217 --> 38:07.550
<i>  The referee had</i>
<i>  to stop the match</i>

38:07.552 --> 38:10.520
<i>  and let the crew bots try to</i>
<i>  separate these two.</i>

38:11.657 --> 38:13.823
<i>  Now, this would have gone</i>
<i>  to the judges</i>

38:13.825 --> 38:16.293
<i>  if the robots couldn't</i>
<i>  be pulled apart,</i>

38:16.295 --> 38:18.161
<i>  but the fans, they're in luck</i>

38:18.163 --> 38:21.464
<i>  because the carnage is</i>
<i>  about to re-commence.</i>

38:25.504 --> 38:27.537
[audience chanting]
fight! Fight! Fight!

38:27.539 --> 38:31.341
<i> [chris] and as soon as these</i>
<i>  drivers hear the buzzer,</i>
<i>  it is go time.</i>

38:32.811 --> 38:35.211
<i> [kenny] rotator has got some</i>
<i>  work to do here, chris.</i>

38:39.184 --> 38:42.152
<i> [chris] let the bot battle,</i>
<i>  uh, resume.</i>

38:42.154 --> 38:43.787
[audience cheering]

38:43.789 --> 38:45.388
[kenny] uh-oh.

38:45.390 --> 38:46.856
<i>  Oh!</i>

38:46.892 --> 38:50.694
<i> [chris] oh! Rotator rips</i>
<i>  the teeth right out</i>
<i>  of kraken's grill.</i>

38:50.696 --> 38:53.830
<i> [kenny] that's not good,</i>
<i>  took two in one shot.</i>

38:55.600 --> 38:57.300
<i> [chris] whoa!</i>

38:57.302 --> 38:59.602
<i> [kenny] now, remember,</i>
<i>  kraken was in control</i>

38:59.604 --> 39:01.771
<i>  of this match before</i>
<i>  the entanglement.</i>

39:01.773 --> 39:03.506
<i>  You are now looking</i>
<i>  at a desperate</i>

39:03.508 --> 39:06.443
<i>  victor soto and rotator here,</i>

39:06.445 --> 39:08.678
<i>  and maybe a desperate</i>
<i>  match for kraken</i>

39:08.680 --> 39:11.247
<i>  after losing those teeth.</i>

39:11.249 --> 39:15.051
<i> [chris] that left wheel on</i>
<i>  kraken hanging</i>
<i>  out for dear life now.</i>

39:15.053 --> 39:18.455
<i>  Rotator continuing its</i>
<i>  all-out assault.</i>

39:18.457 --> 39:21.358
<i> [kenny] brilliant driving</i>
<i>  there for victor soto.</i>

39:21.360 --> 39:23.059
<i> [chris] oh! There</i>
<i>  goes the tire.</i>

39:23.061 --> 39:25.562
<i> [kenny] oh, he is dissecting</i>
<i>  kraken right now.</i>

39:25.564 --> 39:27.564
<i> [chris] kraken toothless,</i>

39:27.566 --> 39:29.299
<i>  limping out on one wheel</i>

39:29.301 --> 39:33.169
<i>  and gasping for air here</i>
<i>  in the final minute</i>
<i>  of this fight.</i>

39:33.171 --> 39:35.972
<i>  Can rotator finish</i>
<i>  the job now?</i>

39:35.974 --> 39:38.875
<i> [kenny] rotator has been</i>
<i>  great here after the restart,</i>

39:38.877 --> 39:41.144
<i>  but if you're victor</i>
<i>  soto, you do not</i>

39:41.146 --> 39:42.746
<i> want this going to the judges.</i>

39:42.748 --> 39:45.682
<i>  He has an abysmal record</i>
<i>  when it comes to decisions.</i>

39:47.052 --> 39:48.852
<i> [chris] and kraken</i>
<i>  showing just enough</i>

39:48.854 --> 39:51.187
<i>  movement to hold</i>
<i>  off a countdown.</i>

39:52.224 --> 39:53.590
<i>  Oh!</i>

39:53.592 --> 39:55.024
[kenny] i felt
<i>  that</i>

39:55.026 --> 39:56.926
<i>  in my stomach.</i>
<i>  That's how</i>

39:56.928 --> 39:58.461
<i>  powerful that hit was.</i>

39:58.463 --> 40:01.231
<i> [chris] that is kraken guts</i>
<i>  all over the place.</i>

40:01.233 --> 40:04.033
<i> -[kenny] wow!</i>
<i> -[chris] but somehow</i>
<i>  matt spurk is</i>

40:04.035 --> 40:07.470
<i>  still squirming his way</i>
<i>  around the battlebox.</i>

40:07.472 --> 40:10.473
<i> [kenny] yeah, the durability</i>
<i>  of kraken is just insane.</i>

40:11.877 --> 40:13.376
<i> [chris] oh! Oh, my gosh.</i>

40:13.378 --> 40:16.579
<i>  [kenny] what hasn't rotator</i>
<i>  cut up? That's what</i>
<i>  I want to know.</i>

40:16.581 --> 40:19.349
<i>  How is kraken</i>
<i>  still moving out there?</i>

40:19.351 --> 40:21.284
<i>  [chris] this is unbelievable.</i>

40:21.286 --> 40:23.586
<i>  Kraken is refusing to die</i>

40:23.588 --> 40:25.955
<i>  as the final seconds</i>
<i>  tick away.</i>

40:25.957 --> 40:29.092
<i>  Rotator leaving it</i>
<i>  all out on the floor.</i>

40:29.094 --> 40:34.130
<i>  But this one will be decided</i>
<i>  by the panel of judges.</i>

40:35.834 --> 40:38.301
<i>  And that group</i>
<i>  includes derek young,</i>

40:38.303 --> 40:40.870
<i>  lisa winter and jason bardis,</i>

40:40.872 --> 40:43.373
<i>  the three former</i>
<i>  battlebots participants</i>

40:43.375 --> 40:46.509
<i>  will be scoring on</i>
<i>  an 11-point system.</i>

40:46.511 --> 40:48.845
<i>  Five points can be</i>
<i>  awarded for damage,</i>

40:48.847 --> 40:52.182
<i>  three for aggression</i>
<i>  and three for control.</i>

40:53.285 --> 40:55.185
[man] bro.

40:55.187 --> 40:56.286
Whoa!

40:56.288 --> 40:59.489
Holy... Shenanigans!

41:01.626 --> 41:03.092
<i> [chris] yeah, what he said.</i>

41:03.094 --> 41:04.961
<i>  Kenny, kraken</i>
<i>  was hungry to start</i>

41:04.963 --> 41:08.064
<i>  this match and sunk its</i>
<i>  teeth deep into rotator,</i>

41:08.066 --> 41:12.101
<i>  but after a quick stoppage in</i>
<i>  play to untangle the robots,</i>

41:12.103 --> 41:15.371
this one actually turned
in rotator's favor.

41:15.373 --> 41:16.940
<i> [kenny] yeah,</i>
<i>  it's amazing</i>

41:16.942 --> 41:19.976
<i>  how rotator was</i>
<i>  able to adapt, and</i>

41:19.978 --> 41:21.978
<i>  this was the technique</i>
<i>  of the match right there.</i>

41:21.980 --> 41:24.581
<i>  They've kind of beat</i>
<i>  their tail with those forks.</i>

41:24.583 --> 41:26.082
<i>  They jam up kraken,</i>

41:26.084 --> 41:28.551
<i>  one quick spin,</i>
<i>  and in one shot</i>

41:28.553 --> 41:29.819
<i>  they took out two teeth.</i>

41:29.821 --> 41:31.521
<i> [chris] so they went after the</i>

41:31.523 --> 41:34.157
<i>  ivories and then they</i>
<i>  went after the tires,</i>

41:34.159 --> 41:36.926
<i>  and kraken was pretty</i>
<i>  much doomed at that point.</i>

41:36.928 --> 41:38.828
<i> [kenny] that's right. Hard</i>
<i>  to do any damage</i>

41:38.830 --> 41:41.297
<i>  after your primary</i>
<i>  weapon was taken out,</i>

41:41.299 --> 41:43.066
<i>  and that's the</i>
<i>  one I felt in my gut.</i>

41:43.068 --> 41:45.768
<i>  That shot was just</i>
<i>  brutal there.</i>

41:45.770 --> 41:48.071
<i>  What a performance</i>
<i>  there from rotator.</i>

41:48.073 --> 41:50.507
<i> [chris] here's faruq</i>
<i>  with the decision.</i>

41:52.511 --> 41:55.778
The results from
the judges are in.

41:55.780 --> 41:57.814
[audience cheering]

42:00.252 --> 42:04.420
the winner by unanimous
decision is...

42:10.562 --> 42:12.729
Rotator!

42:12.731 --> 42:14.998
[audience cheering]

42:23.975 --> 42:25.942
<i> [chris] victor soto?</i>

42:25.944 --> 42:27.277
<i>  Hey, victor?</i>

42:27.279 --> 42:28.444
Hello, chris.

42:28.446 --> 42:31.281
How cool is it when you get to
dismantle your opponent

42:31.283 --> 42:33.950
piece by piece by piece?

42:35.353 --> 42:37.587
I really didn't expect that.

42:37.589 --> 42:41.291
My strategy was
actually to try to stay away
from the mouth of kraken

42:41.293 --> 42:42.959
because I didn't really
think we could

42:42.961 --> 42:44.294
really pierce that.

42:44.296 --> 42:46.195
So I was trying to get
a little bit of control.

42:46.197 --> 42:49.432
I was, I wasn't really getting
there, and we got stuck.

42:49.434 --> 42:51.367
Oh, man, I just didn't
expect it at all.

42:51.369 --> 42:53.670
And we finally won our
first match ever.

42:53.672 --> 42:55.338
Whoo!

42:55.340 --> 42:57.540
Of the season. Of the season.

42:57.542 --> 43:00.476
[victor] of the season.
We've never won
our first match of the season.

43:00.478 --> 43:01.611
My wife brought good luck.

43:01.613 --> 43:03.646
[chris] yes. Isn't it nice
having your wife here

43:03.648 --> 43:05.315
-for the first time
ever as well?
-Yes.

43:05.317 --> 43:07.150
Yes. Yes.

43:07.152 --> 43:08.651
[chris] yeah. You
better say yes.

43:08.653 --> 43:10.853
There you go.
Victor, congratulations.

43:10.855 --> 43:12.221
-Thank you.
-To your team rotator.

43:12.223 --> 43:13.289
Thank you.

43:13.291 --> 43:15.258
[audience cheering]

43:17.095 --> 43:21.798
<i> [chris] so rotator comes out</i>
<i>  on the right side of</i>
<i>  the judges' decision,</i>

43:21.800 --> 43:24.500
<i>  while kraken again goes three</i>

43:24.502 --> 43:26.035
<i>  full minutes in what ended up</i>

43:26.037 --> 43:28.237
<i>  being a blood bath</i>
<i>  of a battle.</i>

43:28.239 --> 43:30.373
<i>  That thing just will not die.</i>

43:31.576 --> 43:34.544
<i>  Up next, it's a bot</i>
<i>  who last season</i>

43:34.546 --> 43:36.479
<i>  won over the hearts</i>
<i>  of the crowd,</i>

43:36.481 --> 43:39.616
<i>  the competitors and pretty</i>
<i>  much anyone on the planet</i>

43:39.618 --> 43:42.352
<i>  who's interested in</i>
<i>  combat robotics.</i>

43:42.354 --> 43:45.722
<i>  That's right. We'll see</i>
<i>  the little bot that could,</i>

43:45.724 --> 43:47.056
<i>  rusty,</i>

43:47.058 --> 43:50.193
<i>  when we return on battlebots.</i>

43:58.303 --> 44:00.403
[audience cheering]

44:02.374 --> 44:04.474
we are back on battlebots, and

44:04.476 --> 44:05.608
do you know who's back?

44:05.610 --> 44:07.310
You see who's getting
ready to come to the box?

44:07.312 --> 44:08.811
I do. I'm very excited.

44:08.813 --> 44:10.246
It's a fan-favorite,

44:10.248 --> 44:12.782
rusty is here!

44:12.784 --> 44:14.817
[audience cheering]

44:17.122 --> 44:19.455
<i> [chris] and he's going to be</i>
<i>  facing a fancy new</i>

44:19.457 --> 44:21.190
<i>  rookie bot named blip.</i>

44:21.192 --> 44:22.859
<i>  But listen to those chants</i>

44:22.861 --> 44:25.361
<i>  for the little bot that</i>
<i>  could, kenny.</i>

44:25.363 --> 44:27.263
[audience chanting]
rusty! Rusty! Rusty!

44:27.265 --> 44:28.665
<i> [kenny] wow!</i>

44:30.001 --> 44:33.136
<i> [chris] coming up, a rookie of</i>
<i>  the year season,</i>

44:33.138 --> 44:35.738
<i>  dave eaton.</i>
<i>  What a remarkable story!</i>

44:35.740 --> 44:38.374
<i>  Found a bunch of</i>
<i>  junk on his parents'</i>
<i>  farm in illinois.</i>

44:38.376 --> 44:40.443
His word
about the junk, not mine.

44:40.445 --> 44:41.978
And he just won
over the crowd.

44:41.980 --> 44:43.646
<i> -[kenny] yeah.</i>
<i> -[chris] it wasn't like</i>
<i>  he had this</i>

44:43.648 --> 44:45.682
<i>  miraculous season</i>
<i>  inside the box,</i>

44:45.684 --> 44:46.949
<i>  but there's just</i>
<i>  something about</i>

44:46.951 --> 44:49.385
<i>  dave and this robot you</i>
<i>  can't help but love.</i>

44:49.387 --> 44:52.622
<i>  I mean, look at him eating,</i>
<i> popcorn out of rusty's helmet.</i>

44:52.624 --> 44:54.390
<i>  They're like turner & hooch,</i>

44:54.392 --> 44:55.558
<i>  scooby and shaggy...</i>

44:55.560 --> 44:56.859
[mimics scooby]

44:56.895 --> 45:00.663
<i> ...Han and chewie. Insert your</i>
<i>  favorite best buddy duo here.</i>

45:01.900 --> 45:04.300
Exactly. Very sentimental
about rusty.

45:04.302 --> 45:06.436
I think everybody
loves rusty, right?

45:06.438 --> 45:08.471
<i>  It's that combination</i>
<i>  of homeliness</i>

45:08.473 --> 45:10.339
<i>  and heart that makes</i>
<i>  you just want to</i>

45:10.341 --> 45:11.741
<i>  root for this robot.</i>

45:11.743 --> 45:14.644
<i>  But rusty can really</i>
<i>  take a hit too, chris.</i>

45:14.646 --> 45:17.213
<i>  He went the full three</i>
<i>  minutes with sawblaze,</i>

45:17.215 --> 45:19.716
<i>  something no one</i>
<i>  thought he'd be able to do.</i>

45:19.718 --> 45:21.984
<i>  But he's never</i>
<i>  fought a true flipper</i>

45:21.986 --> 45:23.686
<i>  like the one he's about to.</i>

45:23.688 --> 45:27.223
<i>  So will he be able to</i>
<i>  take that kind of punishment</i>
<i>  in tonight's matchup?</i>

45:27.225 --> 45:28.424
<i> [chris] that's a good</i>
<i>  question,</i>

45:28.426 --> 45:31.561
<i> because on the opposite end of</i>
<i>  the technology spectrum,</i>

45:31.563 --> 45:34.897
<i>  we have aren hill's</i>
<i>  new flipper bot, blip.</i>

45:34.899 --> 45:38.067
<i>  Aren, of course, made a run</i>
<i>  all the way to the semifinals</i>

45:38.069 --> 45:39.836
<i>  with tantrum last season,</i>

45:39.838 --> 45:42.438
<i>  and while he's still</i>
<i>  helping his old team,</i>

45:42.440 --> 45:44.340
<i>  this year, he's got</i>
<i>  a brand-new bot</i>

45:44.342 --> 45:46.609
<i>  that uses</i>
<i>  a weapon technology</i>

45:46.611 --> 45:48.945
<i>  that we have never</i>
<i>  seen before.</i>

45:48.947 --> 45:51.647
<i> [kenny] that's right.</i>
<i>  Blip is a flywheel flipper,</i>

45:51.649 --> 45:53.683
<i>  and this is an</i>
<i>  oversimplification,</i>

45:53.685 --> 45:55.384
<i>  but it kind of works</i>
<i>  like a medieval</i>

45:55.386 --> 45:57.987
<i>  weapon called a trebuchet.</i>

45:57.989 --> 46:00.389
<i>  Inside blip, there's a</i>
<i>  metal wheel that rapidly</i>

46:00.391 --> 46:02.492
<i>  twists a synthetic rope.</i>

46:02.494 --> 46:04.427
<i> As it twists, it gets shorter.</i>

46:04.429 --> 46:06.395
<i>  Now where a trebuchet's arm</i>

46:06.397 --> 46:08.698
<i>  fires when it's pulled</i>
<i>  by a counterweight,</i>

46:08.700 --> 46:09.832
<i>  blip's flipper</i>

46:09.834 --> 46:12.969
<i>  fires when it's pulled</i>
<i>  by that shortening rope.</i>

46:12.971 --> 46:14.837
<i>  It's worked in testing,</i>
<i>  but we've seen</i>

46:14.839 --> 46:17.306
<i> plenty of new designs struggle</i>
<i>  in their maiden voyage</i>

46:17.308 --> 46:19.075
<i>  inside the box, and rusty</i>

46:19.077 --> 46:20.810
<i>  is a tough bot to kill.</i>

46:20.812 --> 46:23.880
<i>  So don't underestimate</i>
<i>  the challenge here for blip.</i>

46:25.083 --> 46:28.551
Should be a ton of fun.
Faruq, take it away.

46:28.553 --> 46:31.287
[audience cheering]

46:31.289 --> 46:33.422
[faruq] in the red square,

46:33.424 --> 46:36.092
experts doubted
this bot last year,

46:36.094 --> 46:37.493
they called him a junker.

46:37.495 --> 46:40.096
Now he's a star and all
the hot single bots

46:40.098 --> 46:42.131
are asking for his number.

46:42.133 --> 46:43.800
Tmz keeps hounding him with

46:43.802 --> 46:45.735
questions 'cause
they're curious,

46:45.737 --> 46:47.370
like, "hey, over
here, over here.

46:47.372 --> 46:50.439
Is it true you're
replacing vin diesel
in fast and the furious?"

46:50.441 --> 46:53.009
signing autographs
and taking selfies

46:53.011 --> 46:54.777
is the embodiment
of greatness,

46:54.779 --> 46:57.113
and everyone back on
the farm is like,

46:57.115 --> 47:00.149
"don't forget us when
you're famous."

47:00.151 --> 47:03.219
give it up for rusty!

47:05.456 --> 47:07.623
[audience cheering]

47:09.794 --> 47:12.929
<i> [chris] oh, the one-man</i>
<i> working crew, rusty.</i>

47:15.867 --> 47:19.001
<i>  He's got a</i>
<i> construction cone on his beak.</i>

47:19.003 --> 47:21.204
<i>  Really?</i>

47:21.206 --> 47:23.105
<i> [kenny] oh, I love it.</i>

47:23.107 --> 47:27.143
<i>  Rusty running with the</i>
<i>  hammer configuration</i>
<i>  under that cone,</i>

47:27.145 --> 47:30.613
<i> but dave eaton really tries to</i>
<i>  win fights by surviving them,</i>

47:30.615 --> 47:33.316
<i>  and rusty is as tough</i>
<i>  as they come, chris.</i>

47:36.387 --> 47:38.087
<i>  Duct tape is a</i>
<i>  nice touch to this, too.</i>

47:42.093 --> 47:43.993
[faruq] in the blue square,

47:43.995 --> 47:46.829
when he clears you for
takeoff, get ready to fly.

47:46.831 --> 47:48.097
He'll send you on a trip

47:48.099 --> 47:50.399
through the unfriendly skies.

47:50.401 --> 47:53.469
The flight's a bit bumpy,
but the landing is a calamity.

47:53.471 --> 47:56.539
When you go kaboom,
like the hindenburg.

47:56.541 --> 47:59.508
Oh, the bot-manity!

47:59.510 --> 48:01.544
It's blip!

48:01.546 --> 48:03.679
[audience cheering]

48:06.150 --> 48:09.118
<i> [chris] there is the</i>
<i>  beautifully compact blip.</i>

48:09.120 --> 48:11.721
<i>  Again, captain aren hill</i>
<i>  had tantrum within</i>

48:11.723 --> 48:14.257
<i>  two wins from the giant nut</i>
<i>  last season.</i>

48:14.259 --> 48:16.125
<i>  But, like you said,</i>
<i>  kenny, first fights</i>

48:16.127 --> 48:18.694
<i>  for brand-new bots</i>
<i>  can be a total tossup,</i>

48:18.696 --> 48:20.429
<i>  no matter who the captain is.</i>

48:20.431 --> 48:22.498
<i> [kenny] yeah, I don't think</i>
<i>  blip will have any trouble</i>

48:22.500 --> 48:24.600
<i>  getting under rusty,</i>
<i>  but will that</i>

48:24.602 --> 48:26.969
<i> flywheel flipper actually work</i>

48:26.971 --> 48:28.371
<i>  and will it be able</i>
<i>  to do enough</i>

48:28.373 --> 48:31.674
<i>  damage to a 250-pound</i>
<i>  robot, chris?</i>

48:31.676 --> 48:32.708
<i>  Time to find out.</i>

48:34.879 --> 48:36.545
[audience cheering]

48:39.350 --> 48:42.318
<i>  I'm leading out</i>
<i>  blip this year.</i>
<i>  It's a flywheel flipper,</i>

48:42.320 --> 48:44.287
<i>  which gives us a lot of</i>
<i>  fun advantages over</i>

48:44.289 --> 48:45.388
<i>  traditional flippers.</i>

48:45.390 --> 48:47.323
<i>  Its armor is on</i>
<i>  par with tantrum</i>

48:47.325 --> 48:48.891
<i>  and maneuverability,</i>
<i>  et cetera,</i>

48:48.893 --> 48:51.560
<i>  but the flipper power</i>
<i>  is on par with hydra</i>
<i>  and some of the other...</i>

48:51.562 --> 48:52.662
<i>  Other big boy flippers.</i>

48:52.664 --> 48:54.797
<i>  Blip's first fight is</i>
<i>  against rusty.</i>

48:54.799 --> 48:56.532
<i>  You can't get any more</i>
<i>  endearing than rusty.</i>

48:56.534 --> 48:59.168
<i> Rusty has usually been someone</i>
<i>  who just keeps on tanking.</i>

48:59.170 --> 49:01.203
<i>  So being able to make sure</i>
<i>  we can last the full</i>

49:01.205 --> 49:03.439
<i>  three minutes and not</i>
<i>  have any issues ourselves,</i>

49:03.441 --> 49:05.441
<i>  this is going to be key,</i>
<i>  but we're hoping to</i>

49:05.443 --> 49:07.276
<i> send rusty flying a few times.</i>

49:07.278 --> 49:08.678
<i>  They're a well...</i>
<i>  Well-established team</i>

49:08.680 --> 49:10.579
<i>  and everything, right?</i>
<i>  And he builds really</i>
<i>  good robots.</i>

49:10.581 --> 49:12.281
<i>  He's got his new kinetic</i>

49:12.283 --> 49:14.083
<i>  system for the flipper</i>
<i>  and stuff, so he...</i>

49:14.085 --> 49:16.619
<i>  It'll be interesting to see</i>
<i>  how that works and</i>
<i>  how well it flips the robot.</i>

49:16.621 --> 49:18.187
<i>  If I'm not blowing him</i>
<i>  around the box</i>

49:18.189 --> 49:19.522
<i>  and if he's blowing</i>
<i>  me around the box,</i>

49:19.524 --> 49:21.123
<i>  I know who's going to</i>
<i>  win, who's going to lose.</i>

49:21.125 --> 49:23.592
<i>  I am a little more concerned</i>
<i>  this time going around.</i>

49:23.594 --> 49:26.095
<i>  Obviously, there's more</i>
<i>  expectation for me</i>
<i>  being a second year.</i>

49:26.097 --> 49:28.631
<i>  I'm propping as much</i>
<i>  as I can for this fight</i>
<i>  because I need to win it.</i>

49:29.834 --> 49:30.866
Hell yeah.

<i> [chris] kenny, with</i>
<i>  rusty, it is so cute.</i>

49:40.812 --> 49:44.347
<i>  I just want to run up to him</i>
<i>  and pinch its little cheeks.</i>

49:44.349 --> 49:46.816
<i> [kenny] I think</i>
<i>  everybody's back at the pits</i>
<i>  to sign that thing.</i>

49:46.818 --> 49:48.818
<i>  It's got plenty of</i>
<i>  duct tape as well.</i>

<i>  who's it going to be?</i>

50:39.237 --> 50:41.604
<i>  Let the bot battle begin.</i>

50:41.606 --> 50:44.640
<i>  Blip trying to get</i>
<i>  its bearing straight,</i>
<i>  circles around rusty,</i>

50:44.642 --> 50:46.175

50:47.178 --> 50:50.579
<i>  Whoa! Great height,</i>
<i>  great distance.</i>

50:50.581 --> 50:52.815
<i>  That was definitely a</i>
<i>  nine out of ten.</i>

50:52.817 --> 50:54.984
<i>  Rusty pops back though,</i>

50:54.986 --> 50:57.553
<i>  tracking</i>
<i>  the junkyard bot again.</i>

50:57.555 --> 51:00.589
<i>  Oh!</i>

51:00.591 --> 51:02.725
[chris]
<i>  can rusty fix itself?</i>

51:02.727 --> 51:04.527
<i>  Come on, rusty.</i>

51:04.529 --> 51:05.828
<i> [kenny] he didn't</i>
<i>  stick the landing.</i>

51:05.830 --> 51:08.064
<i>  I'm going to give rusty a</i>
<i>  3.0 on that one, chris.</i>

51:08.066 --> 51:11.367
<i>  [chris] yep, yep, yep. Judge</i>
<i>  really deducted points.</i>

51:11.369 --> 51:14.503
<i> I don't know if blip is trying</i>
<i>  to help rusty get up</i>

51:14.505 --> 51:15.538
<i>  or what.</i>

51:16.641 --> 51:18.707
<i>  Whoa!</i>
<i>  Right, there we go.</i>

51:18.709 --> 51:20.076
<i> [chris] all right.</i>

51:20.078 --> 51:22.178
<i> [kenny] uh-oh. Rusty,</i>

51:24.682 --> 51:26.715
<i>  We're going to have</i>
<i>  to blur this out.</i>

51:26.717 --> 51:27.983
<i> [kenny] it's very revealing.</i>

51:27.985 --> 51:30.052
<i>  Rusty, stab him.</i>
<i>  Rusty, stab him.</i>

51:32.290 --> 51:34.957
<i>  Aren hill is playing</i>
<i>  with his food now.</i>

51:34.959 --> 51:36.859
<i>  Rusty, totally shell-shocked</i>

51:36.861 --> 51:38.427
<i>  and without a shell.</i>

51:38.429 --> 51:41.130
<i>  Is this the end for</i>
<i>  the junkyard bot?</i>

51:41.132 --> 51:42.932

[indistinct chattering]

51:45.036 --> 51:46.469

<i> [chris] man.</i>

51:59.083 --> 52:00.850
I knew it was
gonna be a rough one.

52:05.323 --> 52:08.057
<i> [chris] well, we knew it</i>
<i>  was going to be a long shot</i>
<i>  for rusty, kenny.</i>

52:08.059 --> 52:10.626
<i> [kenny] oh, jeez!</i>
<i>  Speaking of long shot,</i>

52:10.628 --> 52:13.562
<i>  my goodness, so quick</i>
<i>  and so powerful.</i>

52:13.564 --> 52:15.164
<i>  Rusty was hanging</i>
<i>  in there, though.</i>

52:15.166 --> 52:17.666
<i> [chris] yeah. Was able to</i>
<i>  self-right after that</i>

52:17.668 --> 52:21.537
<i>  first big shot, but, man,</i>
<i>  you get in the short corner</i>
<i>  next to the upper deck,</i>

52:21.539 --> 52:24.840
<i>  it's tough. And then here</i>
<i> he comes, right at you, folks.</i>

52:24.842 --> 52:27.376
<i> -[chris] oh!</i>
<i> -[kenny] and</i>
<i>  the pulverizer, jeez.</i>

52:27.378 --> 52:28.878
<i> -[chris] exactly.</i>
<i> -[kenny] two for one deal.</i>

52:28.880 --> 52:29.945
<i> [chris] yeah.</i>

52:31.949 --> 52:33.916
<i> [chris] aren hill.</i>

52:33.918 --> 52:35.518
<i> -[chris] hi, aren.</i>
<i> -Hi, guys.</i>

52:35.520 --> 52:37.953
So we saw you mouthed
the words right before

52:37.955 --> 52:40.723
the fight started,
"I'm sorry, rusty."

52:40.725 --> 52:41.957
[all laughing]

52:43.828 --> 52:46.462
-[chris]
<i>  do you, do you feel bad?</i>
<i> -We do feel bad.</i>

52:46.464 --> 52:47.897
I love rusty,

52:47.899 --> 52:49.698
but I am beyond stoked.

52:49.700 --> 52:51.467
First match out, new robot,

52:51.469 --> 52:53.202
working exactly like
we want it to.

52:53.204 --> 52:55.237
[audience cheering]

52:57.241 --> 52:59.675
aren, you guys made it
all the way to the semifinals

52:59.677 --> 53:01.277
a season ago with tantrum.

53:01.279 --> 53:05.548
You decided to branch
off and start a new season
with a flipper bot.

53:05.550 --> 53:08.050
Can you make a judgment
after just a minute
inside the box

53:08.052 --> 53:10.819
as to how potent
your robot can be?

53:10.821 --> 53:13.656
Yeah, I don't, I don't see
any reason why we
make it just this far.

53:13.658 --> 53:15.324
So you're calling
your shot right now

53:15.326 --> 53:18.594
at least a semifinal
appearance with a
rookie robot?

53:18.596 --> 53:19.628
That's the goal.

53:19.630 --> 53:21.864
[audience cheering]

53:21.866 --> 53:24.366
<i> [chris] impressive.</i>
<i>  I love the confidence.</i>

53:24.368 --> 53:27.369
Aren hill, we'll see you and
team blip down the line.

53:27.371 --> 53:28.837
Thank you, guys.

53:37.548 --> 53:39.081
<i> -[chris] dave?</i>
<i> -It'll bump out.</i>

53:39.083 --> 53:40.783
We can fix it,
make it straight.
Hey, guys.

53:42.687 --> 53:44.753
Rusty is naked right now.

53:44.755 --> 53:46.589
Yeah, yeah.

53:46.591 --> 53:48.624
He kind of flew
by the seat of
his pants there, didn't he?

53:48.626 --> 53:50.659
[all laughing]

53:51.796 --> 53:53.796
oh, yeah.

53:56.801 --> 53:59.335
Is rusty okay?
Chris has tylenol.

53:59.337 --> 54:02.037
I have some duct tape.
If you need anything,
let us know.

54:02.039 --> 54:04.607
I was going to say duct tape
and tylenol is about what
I'm going to need.

54:04.609 --> 54:06.508
I need the tylenol.
He needs the duct tape.

54:08.145 --> 54:09.845
Dave, all kidding
aside, what are

54:09.847 --> 54:11.947
the last ten months
been like for you?

54:11.949 --> 54:15.985
I mean, you exploded
on the scene. You become
a battlebots cult hero.

54:15.987 --> 54:17.753
I mean, listen to
what the audience,

54:17.755 --> 54:19.855
you come out here, they're
chanting rusty's name.

54:19.857 --> 54:21.490

54:29.867 --> 54:32.167
Whoo! Oh, you guys
are way too nice to me.

54:32.169 --> 54:33.202
Thank you.

54:34.705 --> 54:37.339
Whoo! I mean,
I know, you know what?

54:37.341 --> 54:40.209
I love this, because at the
end of the day, I'm going to
build this beautiful machine.

54:40.211 --> 54:42.911
I get to come out here
and be with you guys.
And I love it. I really do.

54:42.913 --> 54:44.947
[audience cheering]

54:46.951 --> 54:49.451
[dave] thanks, guys.
Thank you. Oh, man.

54:49.453 --> 54:51.420
You guys are so nice to me.

54:51.422 --> 54:54.056
Dave eaton and rusty,
you are one of a kind.

54:54.058 --> 54:55.524
-Thank you.
-We'll see in your
next match.

54:55.526 --> 54:57.826
Once again, let's
hear it for rusty!

54:57.828 --> 55:00.362
Thanks, guys.
Thank you.

55:05.503 --> 55:07.002
<i> [chris] well, dave eaton</i>
<i>  didn't get the win</i>

55:07.004 --> 55:11.173
<i>  inside the battlebox,</i>
<i>  but he is a winner in</i>
<i>  life, no question.</i>

55:12.977 --> 55:15.311
<i>  And, kenny, how about blip?</i>

55:15.313 --> 55:18.414
He only had a minute of
game tape, what do you see?

55:18.416 --> 55:20.983
Listen, I saw a bot that
is extremely powerful.

55:20.985 --> 55:22.651
<i>  Again, new technology,</i>
<i>  we weren't sure</i>

55:22.653 --> 55:25.254
<i>  what was going to happen</i>
<i>  out there, but the fact that</i>
<i>  it looked that good</i>

55:25.256 --> 55:27.690
<i>  and that sharp,</i>
<i>  I think it's a really</i>
<i>  good sign for team blip.</i>

55:29.060 --> 55:30.626
<i> [chris] up next,</i>

55:30.628 --> 55:34.797
<i>  it's the return of the</i>

<i>  the semifinals last year.</i>

55:34.799 --> 55:36.231
<i>  Tantrum.</i>

55:36.233 --> 55:39.101
<i>  New captains, alex grant</i>
<i>  and ginger schmidt,</i>

55:39.103 --> 55:41.303
<i>  will throw down</i>
<i>  with bunny sauriol</i>

55:41.305 --> 55:45.908
<i>  and malice when we</i>
<i>  return on battlebots.</i>

55:55.853 --> 55:57.286
[audience cheering]

55:57.288 --> 55:59.521
<i> [chris] welcome back to</i>
<i>  las vegas and week two</i>

55:59.523 --> 56:02.624
<i>  of the battlebots</i>
<i>  2021 season.</i>

56:02.626 --> 56:04.526
<i>  We've already been</i>
<i>  treated to a handful of</i>

56:04.528 --> 56:06.695
<i>  robot destruction</i>
<i>  here tonight,</i>

56:06.697 --> 56:10.799
<i>  and the main event</i>
<i>  of the evening is just</i>
<i>  around the corner.</i>

56:10.801 --> 56:12.201
<i>  We'll see bloodsport</i>

56:12.203 --> 56:15.938
<i>  face off with the 2020</i>
<i>  runner-up whiplash.</i>

56:15.940 --> 56:17.239
<i>  In fact, here is matt vasquez</i>

56:17.241 --> 56:20.242
<i>  moments ago putting the</i>
<i> finishing touches on whiplash.</i>

56:20.244 --> 56:23.712
<i>  Remember, he fell</i>
<i>  just short of winning</i>
<i>  the title last year.</i>

56:23.714 --> 56:26.148
<i>  Matt tells us he intends</i>
<i>  to finish the job</i>

56:26.150 --> 56:30.919
<i>  this time around, and</i>
<i>  that journey begins tonight.</i>

56:30.921 --> 56:33.489
<i>  But right now, we've</i>
<i>  got bunny sauriol's</i>

56:33.491 --> 56:36.625
<i>  malice taking on a team</i>
<i>  that came out of nowhere</i>

56:36.627 --> 56:40.396
<i>  to make a run to the</i>
<i>  semifinals just last season,</i>

56:40.398 --> 56:42.498
<i>  tantrum.</i>

56:42.500 --> 56:45.134
And when you
make that monumental
leap, usually you don't

56:45.136 --> 56:46.769
make a lot of changes
to your team.

56:46.771 --> 56:48.103
<i> [kenny] unless you</i>
<i>  are tantrum.</i>

56:48.105 --> 56:49.204
<i> [chris] as we just saw,</i>

56:49.240 --> 56:52.174
<i>  former captain aren hill</i>
<i>  has a new flipper bot,</i>

56:52.176 --> 56:55.043
<i>  blip, and it certainly looks</i>
<i>  like the real deal.</i>

56:55.045 --> 56:57.212
<i>  Now he's still involved</i>
<i>  with tantrum,</i>

56:57.214 --> 57:01.316
<i>  the two bots are actually</i>
<i>  sharing a 16-person</i>
<i>  crew back in the pits.</i>

57:01.318 --> 57:03.285
<i>  But after last season,</i>
<i>  aren felt like</i>

57:03.287 --> 57:05.320
<i>  tantrum was in</i>
<i>  such a good place,</i>

57:05.322 --> 57:08.657
<i>  he handed the reins to</i>
<i>  new captains, ginger schmidt</i>

57:08.659 --> 57:10.159
<i>  and alex grant.</i>

57:10.161 --> 57:12.461
<i>  They both admitted</i>
<i>  they're a little nervous</i>
<i>  to be the captain,</i>

57:12.463 --> 57:15.464
<i>  but they feel like this is a</i>
<i>  giant nut winning bot still.</i>

57:15.466 --> 57:16.732
<i> [kenny] yeah, no</i>
<i>  question about it.</i>

57:16.734 --> 57:20.035
They're kind of like
one giant team that has
two bots, right?

57:20.037 --> 57:22.638
<i>  But tantrum was just</i>
<i>  amazing last season.</i>

57:22.640 --> 57:24.673
<i>  They feel they have</i>
<i>  a stronger bot.</i>

57:24.675 --> 57:27.409
<i>  The ability to not</i>
<i>  die in combat</i>

57:27.411 --> 57:28.911
<i>  is a real superpower,</i>

57:28.913 --> 57:30.312
<i>  and that's what</i>
<i>  they're all about.</i>

57:30.314 --> 57:32.347
They use their defense
as offense, so

57:32.349 --> 57:34.550
whether they're ramming
themselves into another bot

57:34.552 --> 57:36.185
or getting hit,

57:36.187 --> 57:38.454
they feel that they can
destroy the other bot
just by doing that.

57:38.456 --> 57:40.088
<i> [kenny] and it is a true...</i>
<i>  [continues indistinctly ]</i>

57:40.090 --> 57:41.957
and tonight they are
taking on malice,

57:41.959 --> 57:43.525
captained by bunny sauriol.

57:43.527 --> 57:45.828
<i>  Who's just bouncing around</i>
<i>  here with a ton of energy,</i>

57:45.830 --> 57:47.095
<i>  and she said sometimes</i>

57:47.097 --> 57:48.564
<i>  people would rip on</i>
<i>  me on the internet</i>

57:48.566 --> 57:49.898
<i>  for being too emotional.</i>
<i>  She said,</i>

57:49.900 --> 57:51.600
<i>  "I'm not going to change</i>
<i>  the way I am."</i>

57:51.602 --> 57:53.068
<i>  bunny, you do you.</i>

57:53.070 --> 57:54.837
<i>  You be exactly who you are.</i>

57:54.839 --> 57:56.205
Now she looked at the matchup

57:56.207 --> 57:58.307
tonight, she said,
"yeah, that thing is
a brick over there.

57:58.309 --> 58:00.509
This is not a good matchup,
but it doesn't matter

58:00.511 --> 58:02.411
because we just want
to ram him, face first.

58:02.413 --> 58:04.246
-[chris]
<i>  we're all right with that."</i>
<i> -[kenny] exactly.</i>

58:04.248 --> 58:05.280
<i>  She's here</i>
<i>  to have a fun time.</i>

58:05.282 --> 58:07.049
<i>  She wants to have great</i>
<i>  fights. She wants to</i>

58:07.051 --> 58:09.218
<i>  hit other bots as</i>
<i>  hard as she can,</i>

58:09.220 --> 58:13.355
<i>  and malice has one</i>
<i>  of the biggest disc spinners</i>
<i>  in this competition.</i>

58:13.357 --> 58:14.690
<i>  But is it big enough</i>

58:14.692 --> 58:17.593
<i>  to take down a bot with</i>
<i>  an iron chin like tantrum?</i>

58:17.595 --> 58:19.495
Let's see if she
can pull that off.

58:19.497 --> 58:21.396
Faruq, take it away.

58:21.398 --> 58:23.832
[audience cheering]

58:26.804 --> 58:28.770
in the red square,

58:28.772 --> 58:30.339
this bot packs a punch

58:30.341 --> 58:32.674
like bottomless
mimosas at brunch.

58:32.676 --> 58:35.344
It's tantrum!

58:35.346 --> 58:37.880
[audience cheering]

58:37.882 --> 58:40.449
<i> [chris] and there's the new</i>
<i>  team tantrum</i>

58:40.451 --> 58:43.585
<i>  about to start their own</i>
<i>  chapter here at battlebots,</i>

58:43.587 --> 58:46.722
<i>  and, boy, can that</i>
<i>  bot punch hard.</i>

58:46.724 --> 58:50.225
<i> [kenny] yeah, the design</i>
<i>  of tantrum is so</i>
<i>  unique and effective.</i>

58:50.227 --> 58:52.461
<i>  Its weapon sits</i>
<i>  on a rail system,</i>

58:52.463 --> 58:54.329
<i>  so when the disc</i>
<i>  is pulled back,</i>

58:54.331 --> 58:56.231
<i>  it's protected from contact.</i>

58:56.233 --> 58:57.866
<i>  But when the time is right,</i>

58:57.868 --> 58:59.434
<i>  it can launch forward</i>

58:59.436 --> 59:00.769
<i>  to punch its opponent</i>

59:00.771 --> 59:02.771
<i>  with 18 pounds of steel</i>

59:02.773 --> 59:06.074
<i>  rotating at about 8,500 rpm.</i>

59:08.612 --> 59:10.412
[faruq] in the blue square,

59:10.414 --> 59:12.748
from san jose, california,

59:12.750 --> 59:14.983
this bunny ain't
from energizer,

59:14.985 --> 59:16.852
but when it's
time to kill you,

59:16.854 --> 59:18.487
she keeps going

59:18.489 --> 59:19.721
and going

59:19.723 --> 59:21.189
and going.

59:21.191 --> 59:24.293
Give it up for malice!

59:24.295 --> 59:25.527
[audience cheerinig]

59:25.529 --> 59:27.329
<i> [chris] there is</i>
<i>  bunny sauriol, the</i>

59:27.331 --> 59:30.933
<i>  always excitable team</i>
<i>  captain of malice.</i>

59:30.935 --> 59:32.334
<i> How's your bot looking, kenny?</i>

59:32.336 --> 59:33.468
<i>  That's what I want to know.</i>

59:33.470 --> 59:34.570
<i> [kenny] the bot looks great.</i>

59:34.572 --> 59:36.405
<i>  One of the biggest issues</i>
<i>  they've addressed</i>

59:36.407 --> 59:39.341
<i>  coming into this season</i>
<i>  is weapon reliability.</i>

59:39.343 --> 59:41.176
<i>  Malice was consistently able</i>

59:41.178 --> 59:43.545
<i>  to survive three minutes</i>
<i>  of punishment,</i>

59:43.547 --> 59:46.415
<i>  but it was often after</i>
<i>  losing their weapon early.</i>

59:46.417 --> 59:48.617
<i>  If they can keep</i>
<i>  that disc spinning,</i>

59:48.619 --> 59:50.719
<i>  malice is a very</i>
<i>  dangerous bot.</i>

59:55.559 --> 59:57.793
[audience chanting]
malice! Malice! Malice!

1:00:00.130 --> 1:00:02.764
<i>  Malice has a giant</i>
<i>  spinning horizontal weapon</i>

1:00:02.766 --> 1:00:03.966
<i>  at the front of its robot,</i>

1:00:03.968 --> 1:00:05.534
<i>  but tantrum has strong armor,</i>

1:00:05.536 --> 1:00:07.536
<i>  so we're hoping, in</i>
<i>  the beginning of the match,</i>

1:00:07.538 --> 1:00:09.404
<i>  to get at them</i>
<i>  from an angle and absorb</i>

1:00:09.406 --> 1:00:12.240
<i>  the energy from their disc</i>
<i>  into our strong armor</i>

1:00:12.242 --> 1:00:15.010
<i>  and slow them down. And once</i>
<i>  their disc is slowed down,</i>

1:00:15.012 --> 1:00:16.845
<i>  we're going to go around</i>
<i>  the sides, around the front</i>

1:00:16.847 --> 1:00:19.081
<i>  to scoop them up</i>
<i>  and deliver a punch.</i>

1:00:19.083 --> 1:00:21.249
<i>  So tantrum is a big box.</i>

1:00:21.251 --> 1:00:25.187
<i>  Unfortunately, the only way</i>
<i>  that we can actually</i>

1:00:25.189 --> 1:00:27.956
<i>  deal with tantrum,</i>
<i>  hit him as hard as we can,</i>

1:00:27.958 --> 1:00:29.391
<i>  throw him across the arena.</i>

1:00:29.393 --> 1:00:31.593
<i>  Our new weapon is called</i>
<i>  the rolling blackout,</i>

1:00:31.595 --> 1:00:34.096
<i>  and you can throw a tantrum</i>
<i>  as much as you want,</i>

1:00:34.098 --> 1:00:36.231
<i>  but you're not going to</i>
<i>  beat the rolling blackouts.</i>

1:00:36.233 --> 1:00:38.266
[audience cheering]

1:00:41.372 --> 1:00:42.938
[automated voice]
<i>  robots, activate.</i>

1:00:44.341 --> 1:00:47.075
<i> [chris] and, kenny, tell us</i>
<i>  about that little bunny tale</i>

1:00:47.077 --> 1:00:49.244
<i>  that's now</i>
<i>  on malice's backside?</i>

1:00:49.246 --> 1:00:51.580
<i> [kenny] last year,</i>
<i>  they actually lost</i>
<i>  a few fights</i>

1:00:51.582 --> 1:00:54.249
<i>  because they got tipped up</i>
<i>  onto their backside</i>

1:00:54.251 --> 1:00:56.251
<i>  and then couldn't</i>
<i>  tip back over.</i>

1:00:58.389 --> 1:01:01.790
<i> [chris] will tantrum pick up</i>
<i>  where they left off</i>
<i>  last season,</i>

1:01:01.792 --> 1:01:04.893
<i>  or can malice give</i>
<i>  these rookie captains</i>

1:01:04.895 --> 1:01:07.596
<i>  the welcome to</i>
<i>  the big leagues moment?</i>

1:01:07.598 --> 1:01:10.265
<i>  We'll find out</i>
<i>  when we return...</i>

1:01:11.568 --> 1:01:13.368
<i>  On battlebots!</i>

1:01:18.642 --> 1:01:19.741
[audience cheering]

1:01:19.743 --> 1:01:21.443
<i> [chris] we are</i>
<i>  back on battlebots,</i>

1:01:21.445 --> 1:01:24.946
<i>  and we have two teams</i>
<i>  in the box ready to rumble.</i>

1:01:24.948 --> 1:01:27.215
<i>  It's semifinalists</i>
<i>  from last season,</i>

1:01:27.217 --> 1:01:31.987
<i>  tantrum squaring off</i>
<i> with bunny sauriol and malice.</i>

1:01:33.323 --> 1:01:35.223
We got this, guys.

1:01:35.225 --> 1:01:37.292
[audience cheering]

1:01:47.004 --> 1:01:48.770
[audience chanting]
fight! Fight! Fight!

1:01:57.414 --> 1:01:59.014
[chris]
<i>  let the bot battle begin.</i>

1:01:59.016 --> 1:02:00.248
<i>  And tantrum</i>

1:02:00.250 --> 1:02:02.751
<i>  goes right after malice and</i>
<i> delivers the shot to the beak.</i>

1:02:02.753 --> 1:02:04.119
<i> [kenny] that was a big hit.</i>

1:02:04.121 --> 1:02:05.854
<i>  You can see it.</i>
<i>  Part of their strategy</i>

1:02:05.856 --> 1:02:07.823
<i>  is certainly</i>
<i>  to box rush malice.</i>

1:02:07.825 --> 1:02:09.858
<i>  They don't want</i>
<i>  that weapon to get started.</i>

1:02:09.860 --> 1:02:11.560
<i> [chris] so far so good, kenny.</i>

1:02:11.562 --> 1:02:13.095
<i>  At the moment,</i>
<i>  malice's weapon</i>

1:02:13.097 --> 1:02:15.363
<i>  doesn't look to be moving,</i>

1:02:15.365 --> 1:02:16.498
<i>  and here's tantrum</i>

1:02:16.500 --> 1:02:20.202
<i>  firing up that...</i>
<i>  [continues indistinctly ]</i>

1:02:20.204 --> 1:02:22.037
<i> [kenny] and one thing that</i>
<i>  really stands out right now</i>

1:02:22.039 --> 1:02:23.638
<i>  is the speed of tantrum.</i>

1:02:23.640 --> 1:02:25.941
<i>  They are all over malice.</i>

1:02:25.943 --> 1:02:28.510
<i> [chris] tantrum chasing them</i>
<i>  around the battlebox.</i>

1:02:28.512 --> 1:02:30.946
<i>  Malice so slipping away.</i>

1:02:30.948 --> 1:02:33.115
<i> [kenny] david rush,</i>
<i>  the driver of malice,</i>

1:02:33.117 --> 1:02:36.551
<i>  doing an excellent job</i>
<i>  of staying squared up</i>
<i>  to tantrum</i>

1:02:36.553 --> 1:02:38.987
<i>  ever since</i>
<i>  that weapon weighed down.</i>

1:02:38.989 --> 1:02:40.622
<i>  That is not an easy task</i>

1:02:40.624 --> 1:02:43.225
<i>  to maneuver a bot</i>
<i>  as big as malice.</i>

1:02:43.227 --> 1:02:47.129
<i>  Tantrum is so compact</i>
<i>  and so fast.</i>

1:02:47.131 --> 1:02:48.463
<i> [chris] and so loud, too,</i>

1:02:48.465 --> 1:02:50.098
<i>  I mean, listen</i>
<i>  to that weapon.</i>

1:02:50.100 --> 1:02:51.933
<i> It's like a jet engine, kenny.</i>

1:02:51.935 --> 1:02:54.136
<i>  Kind of reminds</i>
<i>  me of minotaur.</i>

1:02:54.138 --> 1:02:55.704
<i> [kenny] yeah. And you</i>
<i>  see tantrum</i>

1:02:55.706 --> 1:02:57.038
<i>  winning that ground game,</i>

1:02:57.040 --> 1:02:59.674
<i>  getting underneath</i>
<i>  malice repeatedly.</i>

1:02:59.676 --> 1:03:01.276
<i> [chris] nice little</i>
<i>  pop by tantrum</i>

1:03:01.278 --> 1:03:03.278
<i>  to the underbelly of malice.</i>

1:03:03.280 --> 1:03:05.480
<i>  Under two minutes to go</i>
<i>  in this match now.</i>

1:03:07.785 --> 1:03:10.218
<i>  Malice gritting its teeth</i>
<i>  to stay in this fight.</i>

1:03:11.421 --> 1:03:13.288
<i> -[chris] oh!</i>
<i> -[kenny] oh! What a hit!</i>

1:03:14.558 --> 1:03:16.458
<i>  What a beautiful hit</i>
<i>  done by tantrum.</i>

1:03:16.460 --> 1:03:18.927
<i> [chris] tantrum underneath</i>
<i>  malice again here</i>

1:03:18.929 --> 1:03:20.796
<i> and driving it into the rails,</i>

1:03:20.798 --> 1:03:24.666
<i>  landing a couple of shots</i>
<i>  and now pinning it</i>
<i>  into the corner.</i>

1:03:24.668 --> 1:03:27.035
<i>  Malice has been on</i>
<i>  the defensive and now...</i>

1:03:27.037 --> 1:03:29.738
<i> -[kenny] uh-oh.</i>
<i> -[chris] uh-oh. Is it stuck,</i>
<i>  stuck under the rails?</i>

1:03:30.941 --> 1:03:32.007
<i>  Can they move it all?</i>

1:03:32.009 --> 1:03:34.676
[audience cheering]

1:03:34.678 --> 1:03:36.144
<i> [kenny] oh, how about tantrum,</i>

1:03:36.146 --> 1:03:38.280
<i>  they want to keep</i>
<i>  the fight going, chris.</i>

1:03:38.282 --> 1:03:42.117
<i>  Dislodging malice there,</i>
<i>  and we are back in business.</i>

1:03:42.119 --> 1:03:44.619
<i> [chris] but tantrum</i>
<i>  go right back after malice</i>

1:03:44.621 --> 1:03:46.721
<i>  and just alluded</i>
<i>  the pulverizer.</i>

1:03:46.723 --> 1:03:50.592
<i>  Tantrum has got malice pinned</i>
<i>  yet again in the corner.</i>

1:03:50.594 --> 1:03:54.229
<i> -[chris] oh!</i>
<i>  -[kenny] oh, my goodness!</i>

1:03:54.231 --> 1:03:58.200
<i> [chris] tantrum is scoring</i>
<i>  major points on</i>
<i>  the judges' scorecard.</i>

1:03:58.202 --> 1:04:01.670
<i> [kenny] I think they took</i>
<i>  some pieces off of malice</i>
<i>  with those hits, too.</i>

1:04:01.672 --> 1:04:04.039
<i> [chris] and don't look now,</i>
<i>  but for at least a moment,</i>

1:04:04.041 --> 1:04:07.309
<i>  tantrum's weapon appears</i>
<i>  to be no longer working.</i>

1:04:07.311 --> 1:04:09.144
<i>  Malice, of course,</i>
<i>  has been dormant</i>

1:04:09.146 --> 1:04:11.279
<i>  since the very first seconds</i>
<i>  of this fight.</i>

1:04:13.217 --> 1:04:16.051
<i> [kenny] well, I tell you what,</i>
<i>  you know, malice is taking</i>
<i>  a beating out there,</i>

1:04:16.053 --> 1:04:18.386
<i>  but I'm impressed</i>
<i>  with its durability.</i>

1:04:18.388 --> 1:04:21.790
<i> The team has got to figure out</i>
<i>  these weapon issues, though.</i>

1:04:21.792 --> 1:04:24.860
<i>  Hard to win if you</i>
<i>  can't do damage.</i>

1:04:24.862 --> 1:04:27.295
<i> [chris] forty seconds</i>
<i>  left to go.</i>

1:04:27.297 --> 1:04:29.664
<i>  Now it's pretty much</i>
<i>  just a pushing match,</i>

1:04:29.666 --> 1:04:32.200
<i>  as we say, and you</i>
<i>  got to credit malice</i>

1:04:32.202 --> 1:04:33.602
<i> for stopping tantrum's weapon,</i>

1:04:33.604 --> 1:04:35.537
<i>  but they still have</i>
<i>  a ton of ground</i>

1:04:35.539 --> 1:04:37.372
<i>  to make up on the scorecards</i>

1:04:37.374 --> 1:04:39.641
<i>  as tantrum has been</i>
<i>  in total control.</i>

1:04:40.844 --> 1:04:42.711
<i>  Tantrum driving</i>
<i>  malice backwards.</i>

1:04:42.713 --> 1:04:45.547
<i>  Oh! Into the rails</i>
<i>  for good measure,</i>

1:04:45.549 --> 1:04:48.416
<i>  refusing to let up</i>
<i>  down the stretch.</i>

1:04:48.418 --> 1:04:50.051
<i> [kenny] tantrum has</i>
<i>  been lower,</i>

1:04:50.053 --> 1:04:53.421
<i>  they've been faster,</i>
<i>  they've been better, chris.</i>

1:04:53.423 --> 1:04:56.124
<i> [chris] even so, this fight</i>
<i>  is going to go the distance</i>

1:04:56.126 --> 1:05:00.028
<i>  as tantrum, very impressive</i>
<i>  in their opening match...</i>

1:05:01.531 --> 1:05:03.498
<i>  But malice hangs in and</i>

1:05:03.500 --> 1:05:06.968
<i>  will force a decision</i>
<i>  by the judges,</i>

1:05:06.970 --> 1:05:09.204
<i> a remarkable feat nonetheless.</i>

1:05:10.974 --> 1:05:13.541
<i>  Kenny, a huge</i>
<i>  head-to-head collision,</i>

1:05:13.543 --> 1:05:16.378
<i>  and I don't know if</i>
<i>  that did something</i>
<i>  to rolling blackout,</i>

1:05:16.380 --> 1:05:17.612
<i>  the weapon of malice.</i>

1:05:17.614 --> 1:05:19.748
<i> [kenny] yeah, well, listen,</i>
<i>  tantrum did not want that</i>

1:05:19.750 --> 1:05:22.117
<i>  devastating weapon of malice</i>
<i>  to get fired up,</i>

1:05:22.119 --> 1:05:24.119
<i>  so they went right at them.</i>

1:05:24.121 --> 1:05:27.489
<i>  Did a great job</i>
<i>  of attacking it,</i>
<i>  staying aggressive.</i>

1:05:27.491 --> 1:05:28.757
<i>  And for me, I think</i>

1:05:28.759 --> 1:05:30.225
<i>  the story really was</i>
<i>  the ground game.</i>

1:05:30.227 --> 1:05:31.893
<i>  What a hit right there</i>
<i>  from tantrum,</i>

1:05:31.895 --> 1:05:34.462
<i>  but they got</i>
<i>  underneath malice repeatedly.</i>

1:05:34.464 --> 1:05:37.098
<i>  So they were not</i>
<i>  taking any force out there.</i>

1:05:37.100 --> 1:05:39.668
<i>  They were able</i>
<i>  to get underneath</i>
<i>  and do the hitting,</i>

1:05:39.670 --> 1:05:41.036
<i>  the whole fight.</i>

1:05:41.038 --> 1:05:43.972
<i> [chris] and malice</i>
<i>  did get pinned</i>
<i>  in the corner momentarily,</i>

1:05:43.974 --> 1:05:46.808
<i>  but tantrum with</i>
<i>  some solid sportsmanship</i>

1:05:46.810 --> 1:05:49.978
<i>  after flipping it,</i>
<i>  which wasn't exactly</i>
<i>  the nice part,</i>

1:05:49.980 --> 1:05:51.880
<i>  but tantrum did do a nice job</i>

1:05:51.882 --> 1:05:54.282
<i>  of allowing malice</i>
<i>  to get back in this fight,</i>

1:05:54.284 --> 1:05:56.451
<i>  but malice</i>
<i>  just didn't have much.</i>

1:05:56.453 --> 1:05:57.886
<i> [kenny] no, they didn't.</i>
<i>  And of course,</i>

1:05:57.888 --> 1:05:59.888
<i>  we have to highlight,</i>
<i>  the driving</i>

1:05:59.890 --> 1:06:01.589
<i>  of team tantrum as well.</i>

1:06:01.591 --> 1:06:03.291
<i>  They were just all over him,</i>

1:06:03.293 --> 1:06:05.327
<i>  so aggressive</i>
<i>  and so well-built.</i>

1:06:05.329 --> 1:06:06.461
<i>  Look at that thing.</i>

1:06:08.231 --> 1:06:10.832
The results from
the judges are in.

1:06:10.834 --> 1:06:12.934
[audience cheering]

1:06:14.438 --> 1:06:19.007
and the winner
by unanimous decision is...

1:06:21.044 --> 1:06:23.878
Tantrum!

1:06:23.880 --> 1:06:25.113
[audience cheering]

1:06:25.115 --> 1:06:28.616
whoo! Yeah!

1:06:28.618 --> 1:06:29.851
Whoo!

1:06:35.192 --> 1:06:37.125
[indistinct chattering]

1:06:40.197 --> 1:06:41.997
ginger and alex,

1:06:41.999 --> 1:06:46.101
-congratulations on your
first win as co-captains.
-Thank you.

1:06:46.103 --> 1:06:47.902
Ginger, was it really
that first shot

1:06:47.904 --> 1:06:49.738
that kind of set the tone
of this fight?

1:06:49.740 --> 1:06:52.007
Yes, coming after last season

1:06:52.009 --> 1:06:54.175
where we made it all the way
to the semifinals,

1:06:54.177 --> 1:06:56.378
lost to end game,
the champions,

1:06:56.380 --> 1:06:59.214
there was a lot of pressure
riding on this fight.

1:06:59.216 --> 1:07:01.449
Our first fight,
there are high expectations.

1:07:01.451 --> 1:07:04.319
We wanted to come out
and have a really strong match

1:07:04.321 --> 1:07:06.421
to prove that. Last year
was not a fluke.

1:07:06.423 --> 1:07:07.856
Tantrum is strong
and we're ready

1:07:07.858 --> 1:07:09.724
to take it all the way
again this year.

1:07:09.726 --> 1:07:11.760
[audience cheering]

1:07:15.365 --> 1:07:16.464
so what did you see

1:07:16.466 --> 1:07:19.367
from that first shot
that you gave malice, alex?

1:07:19.369 --> 1:07:21.536
Uh, we saw a huge hit

1:07:21.538 --> 1:07:23.304
and then their weapon
stopped moving.

1:07:23.306 --> 1:07:25.707
That was awesome.
That's exactly what we wanted.

1:07:25.709 --> 1:07:28.009
Well, we didn't skunk
the match, right?

1:07:28.011 --> 1:07:30.678
Like, that was the big thing.
We got our first win.
It's huge.

1:07:30.680 --> 1:07:33.048
What do you think aren's going
to tell you back in the pits?

1:07:33.050 --> 1:07:35.050
He's going to, he's going to
give me a solid pat
on the back.

1:07:35.052 --> 1:07:36.651
Pat on the back
and, you know,

1:07:36.653 --> 1:07:39.154
say, "good job," you know,
"make it to the top four

1:07:39.156 --> 1:07:40.789
and then talk to me."

1:07:40.791 --> 1:07:43.358
nice. Hey, congratulations,
team tantrum.

1:07:43.360 --> 1:07:44.926
You are 1-0.

1:07:44.928 --> 1:07:46.027
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1:07:50.901 --> 1:07:52.434
Kenny, tantrum
ain't joking around.

1:07:52.436 --> 1:07:54.169
That thing is a solid brick.

1:07:54.171 --> 1:07:56.738
Listen, that's why they were
a final four bot last season.

1:07:56.740 --> 1:07:58.540
They're even better
this season.

1:07:58.542 --> 1:08:00.542
<i>  I just love the way</i>
<i>  that thing is moving,</i>

1:08:00.544 --> 1:08:02.710
<i>  driving, they're on point.</i>

1:08:02.712 --> 1:08:03.845
<i> [chris] all right. Coming up,</i>

1:08:03.847 --> 1:08:06.114
<i>  it's the moment</i>
<i>  we've all been waiting for,</i>

1:08:06.116 --> 1:08:08.216
tonight's main event.

1:08:08.218 --> 1:08:10.385
<i>  Back from a runner-up</i>
<i>  finish last year</i>

1:08:10.387 --> 1:08:13.188
<i>  with whiplash being</i>
<i>  another March to the final?</i>

1:08:13.190 --> 1:08:15.890
<i>  Or will bloodsport</i>
<i>  and its punishing spin</i>

1:08:15.892 --> 1:08:18.893
<i>  hand them a second,</i>
<i>  devastating loss in a row?</i>

1:08:18.895 --> 1:08:21.696
<i>  Let's take a closer look</i>
<i>  at this matchup.</i>

1:08:23.667 --> 1:08:26.534
<i> [chris] oh! Whiplash right on</i>
<i>  the attack.</i>

1:08:26.536 --> 1:08:28.236
<i> [faruq] whiplash!</i>

1:08:28.238 --> 1:08:29.637
<i> [chris] and here comes</i>
<i>  whiplash again.</i>

1:08:29.639 --> 1:08:31.372
Whiplash!

1:08:31.374 --> 1:08:33.141
[chris] whiplash says,
"is that all you got?"

1:08:33.143 --> 1:08:35.610
<i> [faruq] whiplash!</i>

1:08:35.612 --> 1:08:37.112
Last season, we got closer

1:08:37.114 --> 1:08:39.447
than we have ever gotten
to winning the giant nut.

1:08:40.550 --> 1:08:43.485
<i> [chris] it is</i>
<i>  championship time.</i>

1:08:45.989 --> 1:08:48.723
And that final match,
it was just so close,
yet so far.

1:08:48.725 --> 1:08:50.391
<i> -[chris] oh. Whoa!</i>
<i> -[kenny] uh-oh!</i>

1:08:50.393 --> 1:08:52.861
<i> [chris] can whiplash recover?</i>

1:08:52.863 --> 1:08:54.496
I just couldn't pull it out.

1:08:54.498 --> 1:08:58.733
<i> -[kenny] oh!</i>
<i> -[chris] oh, my gosh!</i>
<i>  That is it! That is it!</i>

1:09:07.077 --> 1:09:08.243
I have never actually said

1:09:08.245 --> 1:09:09.711
that this will be our year
to win the nut.

1:09:14.151 --> 1:09:15.483
It is our year
to win the nut.

1:09:16.853 --> 1:09:18.386
<i>  But I need to test the robot</i>

1:09:18.388 --> 1:09:20.855
<i>  as hard as I can</i>
<i>  for the tournament.</i>

1:09:20.857 --> 1:09:23.124
And I think that bloodsport
is a great opponent
to do that with.

1:09:26.096 --> 1:09:31.199
<i> [faruq] it's bloodsport!</i>

1:09:31.201 --> 1:09:33.468
Last season, we had
one of the hardest hitting
weapons.

1:09:34.671 --> 1:09:35.870
<i> [chris] oh!</i>

1:09:35.872 --> 1:09:38.606
<i> [kenny] that may have been</i>
<i>  the death blow, chris.</i>

1:09:38.608 --> 1:09:40.975
And this year, I think
we really have the chance
to go all the way.

1:09:43.446 --> 1:09:45.980
<i>  We got two new weapon blades,</i>
<i>  which are brand-new.</i>

1:09:45.982 --> 1:09:47.649
<i>  Ar500 blades,</i>

1:09:47.651 --> 1:09:50.051
<i>  different material,</i>
<i>  much stronger,</i>

1:09:50.053 --> 1:09:52.353
that should be able to hit
even harder than last year.

1:09:52.355 --> 1:09:54.923
<i> [chris] big-time</i>
<i>  energy release on that.</i>

1:09:54.925 --> 1:09:56.925
Bloodsport is definitely
one of the most

1:09:56.927 --> 1:09:59.027
deadly horizontal
spinners here.

1:09:59.029 --> 1:10:01.563
But to beat us, they need to
stay away from me.

1:10:01.565 --> 1:10:02.864
They need to get spun up.

1:10:02.866 --> 1:10:05.066
<i> [chris] oh, you could really</i>
<i>  hear that thing humming.</i>

1:10:05.068 --> 1:10:07.735
And I don't think I'm going to
let them do that.

1:10:07.737 --> 1:10:09.037
<i> -[chris] whiplash in a...</i>
<i> -[kenny] oh!</i>

1:10:09.039 --> 1:10:10.405
<i>  ...Huge box rush!</i>

1:10:10.407 --> 1:10:12.373
<i> [matt] I don't think I've</i>
<i>  ever let anyone do that.</i>

1:10:13.944 --> 1:10:17.712
Whiplash is a very,
very good control bot.

1:10:17.714 --> 1:10:19.380
<i>  But can they take our hits?</i>

1:10:20.483 --> 1:10:22.016
No way.

1:10:22.018 --> 1:10:23.484
<i> [chris] oh!</i>

1:10:23.486 --> 1:10:25.119
Having the upper deck
in the arena

1:10:25.121 --> 1:10:27.055
really gives us
that extra edge.

1:10:27.057 --> 1:10:28.723
<i>  We will get them</i>
<i>  on top of that.</i>

1:10:28.725 --> 1:10:30.525
<i>  To the judges,</i>
<i>  that'll be huge.</i>

1:10:31.628 --> 1:10:33.161
[man]
<i>  we're a top contender.</i>

1:10:33.163 --> 1:10:35.230
Bloodsport can deliver
so much damage.

1:10:35.232 --> 1:10:37.031
<i> [chris] oh! Huge impact!</i>

1:10:37.033 --> 1:10:40.702
We really need to aim
for its wheels, aim
for the edges.

1:10:40.704 --> 1:10:43.271
If we just hit one thing
in their bot that's critical,
then

1:10:43.273 --> 1:10:45.139
whiplash will get destroyed.

1:10:45.141 --> 1:10:47.175
<i> [chris] look at this!</i>

1:10:47.177 --> 1:10:48.276
May the better robot win.

1:10:55.051 --> 1:10:58.953
I am peter abrahamson
and I am the bot whisperer.

1:10:58.955 --> 1:11:01.356
Combat robotics has been
around for a long time

1:11:01.358 --> 1:11:02.523
and so have I.

1:11:02.525 --> 1:11:05.026
<i>  I've been in it since 1994.</i>

1:11:05.028 --> 1:11:07.462
<i>  My robot ronin</i>
<i>  from way back when</i>

1:11:07.464 --> 1:11:09.530
<i>  was a heavyweight with treads</i>

1:11:09.532 --> 1:11:12.033
<i>  I machined myself all the way</i>
<i>  round the robot.</i>

1:11:12.035 --> 1:11:13.368
<i> [announcer] ronin!</i>

1:11:13.370 --> 1:11:17.038
I actually started
in special effects for film,
television,

1:11:17.040 --> 1:11:19.641
<i>  making creatures,</i>
<i>  monsters, robots</i>

1:11:19.643 --> 1:11:21.643
<i>  for movies and tv.</i>

1:11:21.645 --> 1:11:24.912
<i>  As the bot whisperer,</i>
<i>  one of my biggest jobs</i>

1:11:24.914 --> 1:11:27.248
is coming around in the pits,

1:11:27.250 --> 1:11:29.717
<i>  being with the builders,</i>
<i>  looking at the changes,</i>

1:11:29.719 --> 1:11:32.720
<i> the adaptations they're making</i>
<i>  for each fight.</i>

1:11:32.722 --> 1:11:34.656
I nerd out when I see
certain things.

1:11:34.658 --> 1:11:36.758
<i>  I get very excited</i>
<i>  by these robots.</i>

1:11:36.760 --> 1:11:39.694
Check this out. This is
one of the discs
from switchback.

1:11:39.696 --> 1:11:43.197
<i>  The ability to sort of</i>
<i>  translate the technical</i>

1:11:43.199 --> 1:11:46.134
<i>  into what goes on</i>
<i>  in that arena</i>

1:11:46.136 --> 1:11:48.503
<i>  is so enjoyable</i>
<i>  and fun for me.</i>

1:11:48.505 --> 1:11:50.638
This is pretty damn close
to a dream job.

1:11:50.640 --> 1:11:52.173
<i>  I mean, it's pretty hard</i>
<i>  to beat.</i>

1:11:57.280 --> 1:11:59.347
[audience cheering]

1:11:59.349 --> 1:12:00.782
[chris]
<i>  we are back on battlebots.</i>

1:12:00.784 --> 1:12:03.785
-Are you ready for our
main event of the evening?
-Ooh, I can't wait.

1:12:03.787 --> 1:12:06.287
<i> [chris] kenny, when we talk</i>
<i>  to these teams before</i>
<i>  the season starts,</i>

1:12:06.289 --> 1:12:08.189
<i>  a lot of them say,</i>
<i>  "hey, I'd be happy to make</i>

1:12:08.191 --> 1:12:10.758
<i>  it into the round of 16</i>
<i>  or the quarterfinals."</i>

1:12:10.760 --> 1:12:12.260
<i>  when we talk with</i>
<i>  matty vasquez,</i>

1:12:12.262 --> 1:12:13.828
<i>  the captain of whiplash,</i>
<i>  he said,</i>

1:12:13.830 --> 1:12:15.663
<i>  "chris and kenny,</i>
<i>  there's one place</i>
<i>  for me to go,</i>

1:12:15.665 --> 1:12:17.031
<i>  that is</i>
<i>  back to the championship,</i>

1:12:17.033 --> 1:12:19.500
<i>  but this time</i>
<i>  I need to hoist</i>
<i>  the giant nut."</i>

1:12:19.502 --> 1:12:21.235
<i>  -it's pretty simple for him.</i>
<i> -[kenny] that's right.</i>

1:12:21.237 --> 1:12:23.104
<i>  And listen, they're always</i>
<i>  looking to try to progress</i>

1:12:23.106 --> 1:12:24.472
<i>  and do better each time out.</i>

1:12:24.474 --> 1:12:26.874
<i>  But matt vasquez told us</i>
<i>  the geometry changes</i>

1:12:26.876 --> 1:12:29.911
<i>  inside the battlebox could be</i>
<i>  exactly what he needs</i>

1:12:29.913 --> 1:12:31.346
<i>  to give them the edge</i>
<i>  this season.</i>

1:12:31.348 --> 1:12:34.415
<i>  With his driving skills,</i>
<i>  he is more than capable</i>

1:12:34.417 --> 1:12:36.684
<i>  of trapping opponents</i>
<i>  in the short corner</i>

1:12:36.686 --> 1:12:39.153
<i>  or throwing them on top</i>
<i>  of the upper deck.</i>

1:12:39.155 --> 1:12:41.389
<i>  Will he be able to do</i>
<i>  that tonight?</i>

1:12:41.391 --> 1:12:42.890
And now they're taking
on a team that was

1:12:42.892 --> 1:12:44.926
really a surprise in 2020,

1:12:44.928 --> 1:12:47.228
<i>  bloodsport,</i>
<i>  led by justin marple.</i>

1:12:47.230 --> 1:12:49.364
<i>  A season ago,</i>
<i>  a perfect regular season,</i>

1:12:49.366 --> 1:12:52.266
<i>  a number two overall seed</i>
<i>  heading into the playoffs.</i>

1:12:52.268 --> 1:12:54.235
<i>  They made it</i>
<i>  to the round of 16,</i>

1:12:54.237 --> 1:12:57.138
<i>  a couple of tightening</i>
<i>  of the screws and bolts</i>

1:12:57.140 --> 1:12:58.506
<i>  and all sorts of stuff</i>

1:12:58.508 --> 1:13:01.142
that's technical jargon
for you people at home.

1:13:01.144 --> 1:13:02.343
-They might advance...
-Good job.

1:13:02.345 --> 1:13:03.745
...All the way. Who knows?

1:13:03.747 --> 1:13:06.047
<i> [kenny] yeah. Listen, I think</i>
<i>  they have a devastating</i>
<i>  weapon,</i>

1:13:06.049 --> 1:13:08.182
<i>  but we saw it snap</i>
<i>  in half last year,</i>

1:13:08.184 --> 1:13:11.052
<i> most notably in the tournament</i>
<i>  against gruff.</i>

1:13:11.054 --> 1:13:15.656
<i> Justin said they switched from</i>
<i>  s7 tool steel to ar500,</i>

1:13:15.658 --> 1:13:17.425
<i>  a much more durable metal.</i>

1:13:17.427 --> 1:13:20.328
<i>  Does that make him an even</i>
<i>  bigger knockout threat?</i>

1:13:20.330 --> 1:13:21.429
<i>  Let's see what they got.</i>

1:13:21.431 --> 1:13:22.864
Should be a good one.

1:13:22.866 --> 1:13:24.332
Faruq, take it away.

1:13:24.334 --> 1:13:26.367
[audience cheering]

1:13:29.506 --> 1:13:32.340
[faruq] ladies and gentlemen,

1:13:32.342 --> 1:13:33.674
are you ready?

1:13:37.580 --> 1:13:40.481
It's time for the main event.

1:13:51.995 --> 1:13:53.861
In the red square,

1:13:53.863 --> 1:13:57.265
this plasma donation program
is legally binding,

1:13:57.267 --> 1:14:00.368
and you'll be spilling blood
like that elevator scene

1:14:00.370 --> 1:14:01.736
in the shining.

1:14:01.738 --> 1:14:05.139
So sit back, relax
and prepare for the pain

1:14:05.141 --> 1:14:07.241
as he uses that giant bar

1:14:07.243 --> 1:14:09.377
to try and find a vein.

1:14:09.379 --> 1:14:12.246
It's bloodsport!

1:14:12.248 --> 1:14:14.315
[audience cheering]

1:14:15.819 --> 1:14:17.952
<i> [chris] bloodsport returning</i>
<i>  for its third season,</i>

1:14:17.954 --> 1:14:19.454
<i>  led by justin marple,</i>

1:14:19.456 --> 1:14:23.524
<i>  who's pushing out that</i>
<i>  nasty, nasty robot.</i>

1:14:23.526 --> 1:14:25.393
<i> [kenny] nasty is a good word,</i>
<i>  chris.</i>

1:14:25.395 --> 1:14:28.796
<i>  They're using their new</i>
<i>  75-pound tri-bar tonight.</i>

1:14:28.798 --> 1:14:30.064
<i>  At top speed,</i>

1:14:30.099 --> 1:14:32.867
<i>  a collision with that thing</i>
<i>  is equivalent to getting hit</i>

1:14:32.869 --> 1:14:36.204
<i>  by a 12-pound bowling ball,</i>
<i>  moving it about</i>

1:14:36.206 --> 1:14:38.439
<i>  300 miles per hour.</i>

1:14:38.441 --> 1:14:42.009
<i> [chris] justin marple going</i>
<i>  for the 7:10 split tonight,</i>
<i>  kenny?</i>

1:14:42.011 --> 1:14:44.645
<i> [kenny] I think he's looking</i>
<i>  for a strike, chris.</i>

1:14:44.647 --> 1:14:46.581
[faruq] in the blue square,

1:14:46.583 --> 1:14:48.516
like a young michael jackson,

1:14:48.518 --> 1:14:50.585
our next bot is a thriller.

1:14:50.587 --> 1:14:52.353
This thing is bad,

1:14:52.355 --> 1:14:54.822
and last season
it won the silver.

1:14:54.824 --> 1:14:56.257
You want to beat it?

1:14:56.259 --> 1:14:58.693
I don't know
how to say this any clearer,

1:14:58.695 --> 1:15:00.995
but if you want to see
its next victim,

1:15:00.997 --> 1:15:03.364
better look at the bot
in the mirror.

1:15:05.335 --> 1:15:07.902
It's whiplash!

1:15:10.840 --> 1:15:13.674
<i> [chris] that a way, my man,</i>
<i>  faruq, way to bring it.</i>

1:15:13.676 --> 1:15:15.243
<i>  Of course,</i>
<i>  he just pulled a hammy</i>

1:15:15.245 --> 1:15:16.811
<i>  and he's going to end up</i>
<i>  on the injured list</i>

1:15:16.813 --> 1:15:19.247
<i>  for the next ten days.</i>
<i>  That's fine.</i>

1:15:19.249 --> 1:15:22.316
<i>  Well, we've already seen</i>
<i>  the vasquez clan</i>
<i>  once tonight,</i>

1:15:22.318 --> 1:15:24.619
<i>  but now</i>
<i>  it's big brother's turn.</i>

1:15:24.621 --> 1:15:28.322
<i>  Twenty-two-year-old captain</i>
<i>  matty vasquez</i>
<i>  on the right there.</i>

1:15:28.324 --> 1:15:30.992
<i>  He is, of course,</i>
<i>  widely regarded as</i>

1:15:30.994 --> 1:15:34.629
<i>  one of the best drivers</i>
<i>  in the entire sport.</i>

1:15:34.631 --> 1:15:37.431
<i> [kenny] he is surgical, chris,</i>
<i>  but take a look</i>

1:15:37.433 --> 1:15:39.834
<i>  at those new piano key</i>
<i>  wedgelets.</i>

1:15:39.836 --> 1:15:42.270
<i>  Those are designed</i>
<i>  to get under bloodsport,</i>

1:15:42.272 --> 1:15:45.072
<i>  which should make his lift</i>
<i>  even more effective.</i>

1:15:45.074 --> 1:15:48.576
<i>  To win this,</i>
<i>  matt needs to sweep</i>
<i>  the control category,</i>

1:15:48.578 --> 1:15:51.112
<i>  and he's hoping those</i>
<i>  wedgelets help him do that.</i>

1:15:56.920 --> 1:15:58.986
<i> [chris] kenny, you talked</i>
<i>  about the nastiness</i>

1:15:58.988 --> 1:16:00.788
<i>  of bloodsport's weapon.</i>

1:16:00.790 --> 1:16:02.490
<i>  The key justin marple said</i>

1:16:02.492 --> 1:16:05.026
<i>  it's got to work</i>
<i>  a full three minutes.</i>

1:16:05.028 --> 1:16:07.261
<i> [kenny] exactly, and</i>
<i>  to do that, they're not</i>

1:16:07.263 --> 1:16:09.730
<i>  going to be constantly</i>
<i>  spinning their tri-bar.</i>

1:16:09.732 --> 1:16:11.365
<i>  They're going to pick</i>
<i>  and choose</i>

1:16:11.367 --> 1:16:12.833
<i>  their spots</i>
<i>  to spin up.</i>

1:16:12.835 --> 1:16:14.135
<i>  So if it's not spinning,</i>

1:16:14.137 --> 1:16:16.537
<i>  that doesn't mean</i>
<i>  it's not working.</i>

1:16:16.539 --> 1:16:19.073
<i> [chris] and one thing to keep</i>
<i>  in mind with whiplash,</i>

1:16:19.075 --> 1:16:21.242
<i>  they had six wins</i>
<i>  last season.</i>

1:16:21.244 --> 1:16:23.744
<i>  All six were</i>
<i>  judges' decisions.</i>

1:16:23.746 --> 1:16:26.213
<i>  This bot is tough</i>
<i>  to knock out.</i>

1:16:32.822 --> 1:16:34.355
[automated voice]
<i>  robots, activate.</i>

1:16:34.357 --> 1:16:36.390
[audience cheering]

1:16:45.768 --> 1:16:47.835
[automated voice]
<i>  red team, ready?</i>

1:16:54.310 --> 1:16:56.377

<i>  blue team, ready?</i>

[audience cheering]

1:17:16.366 --> 1:17:18.265
[audience chanting]
fight! Fight! Fight!

1:17:27.644 --> 1:17:29.343
[chris]
<i>  let the bot battle begin.</i>

1:17:29.345 --> 1:17:32.380
<i>  A box rush from whiplash.</i>
<i>  Bloodsport...</i>
<i>  [icontinues indistinctly ]</i>

1:17:32.382 --> 1:17:35.316
<i>  ...Spin up,</i>
<i>  lands a shot,</i>

1:17:35.318 --> 1:17:38.019
<i>  but whiplash says,</i>
<i>  "that's enough out of you,</i>
<i>  pal."</i>

1:17:38.021 --> 1:17:41.255
<i> [kenny] now whiplash is trying</i>
<i>  to stay right on bloodsport.</i>

1:17:41.257 --> 1:17:42.823
<i> [chris] oh!</i>

1:17:42.825 --> 1:17:45.292
<i>  But, kenny, bloodsport</i>
<i>  doing a great job so far,</i>

1:17:45.294 --> 1:17:48.262
<i>  creating space to attack</i>
<i>  here against matt vasquez,</i>

1:17:48.264 --> 1:17:52.033
<i>  and whiplash just</i>
<i>  chipping away at the wedge.</i>

1:17:52.035 --> 1:17:55.403
<i> [kenny] it sure is, and that</i>
<i>  is no easy task, chris.</i>

1:17:55.405 --> 1:17:56.570
<i>  And here you go again,</i>

1:17:56.572 --> 1:17:59.674
<i>  that tri-bar spinner</i>
<i>  really going now.</i>

1:17:59.676 --> 1:18:01.442
<i> [chris] yeah,</i>
<i>  nice little sparks,</i>

1:18:01.444 --> 1:18:04.545
<i>  but here's whiplash</i>
<i>  on the attack.</i>

1:18:04.547 --> 1:18:06.847
<i> [kenny] this is where, this</i>
<i>  is where matt vasquez</i>
<i>  wants to be.</i>

1:18:06.849 --> 1:18:08.482
<i>  Let's see if he uses</i>
<i>  the upper deck here.</i>

1:18:08.484 --> 1:18:11.318
<i>  [chris] bloodsport sheds</i>
<i>  a tire,</i>
<i>  but slips away.</i>

1:18:11.320 --> 1:18:14.522
<i>  Masterful driving by both</i>
<i>  of these captains so far.</i>

1:18:15.692 --> 1:18:17.658
<i> -[kenny] uh-oh.</i>
<i> -[chris] here's matt vasquez,</i>

1:18:17.660 --> 1:18:19.694
<i>  pushing bloodsport</i>
<i>  into the rails,</i>

1:18:19.696 --> 1:18:22.430
<i>  giving it a nice little tour</i>
<i>  of the battlebox.</i>

1:18:22.432 --> 1:18:24.065
<i> [kenny] but how about</i>
<i>  bloodsport</i>

1:18:24.067 --> 1:18:26.600
<i>  throttling that weapon down</i>
<i>  to avoid damage?</i>

1:18:26.602 --> 1:18:29.336
<i>  And now cracking away backup.</i>

1:18:29.338 --> 1:18:31.372
<i> [chris] bloodsport</i>
<i>  fighting an aggressive</i>

1:18:31.374 --> 1:18:33.307
<i>  and intelligent match so far.</i>

1:18:33.309 --> 1:18:36.744
<i>  But here's last year's</i>
<i>  runner-up in control.</i>

1:18:36.746 --> 1:18:38.479
Jam him up into the screws.

1:18:38.481 --> 1:18:42.016
<i> [chris] ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>  that is a 250-pound robot.</i>

1:18:44.120 --> 1:18:46.787
<i>  Oh! Bloodsport</i>
<i>  slips away.</i>

1:18:46.789 --> 1:18:48.823
<i> [kenny] this is becoming</i>
<i>  a pattern, chris.</i>

1:18:48.825 --> 1:18:51.759
<i>  Whiplash just hit with</i>
<i>  the twitch on his teeth.</i>

1:18:53.362 --> 1:18:55.062
<i> [chris] oh! Another big shot.</i>

1:18:55.064 --> 1:18:58.432
<i> [kenny] bloodsport is beating</i>
<i>  up that wedge on whiplash.</i>

1:18:58.434 --> 1:19:00.735
<i>  Give credit to matty</i>
<i>  for staying squared up</i>

1:19:00.737 --> 1:19:02.236
<i>  and protecting the wheels.</i>

1:19:02.238 --> 1:19:03.938
<i>  But I think to this point,</i>
<i>  in this fight,</i>

1:19:03.940 --> 1:19:07.108
<i>  we've got to give</i>
<i>  most of the damage points</i>
<i>  to bloodsport.</i>

1:19:08.144 --> 1:19:10.177
<i> [chris] closing in on</i>
<i>  a minute to go.</i>

1:19:10.179 --> 1:19:12.913
<i>  Can matt vasquez find a way</i>
<i>  to even the scorecard</i>

1:19:12.915 --> 1:19:14.582
<i>  here down the stretch?</i>

1:19:14.584 --> 1:19:17.318
<i>  Kenny, this is going to</i>
<i>  help whiplash.</i>

1:19:17.320 --> 1:19:21.388
<i>  Bloodsport on its</i>
<i>  head over by the upper deck.</i>
<i>  Impressive!</i>

1:19:21.390 --> 1:19:22.957
<i> [kenny] wow!</i>
<i>  Their self-righter</i>

1:19:22.959 --> 1:19:25.392
<i>  is hung up in those screws,</i>
<i>  chris.</i>

1:19:25.394 --> 1:19:27.528
<i> [chris] bloodsport frees</i>
<i>  itself, but</i>
<i>  whiplash gets</i>

1:19:27.530 --> 1:19:29.897
<i>  right back</i>
<i>  on top of it.</i>

1:19:29.899 --> 1:19:32.366
<i>  There is bloodsport,</i>
<i>  back on its head,</i>

1:19:32.368 --> 1:19:35.236
<i>  that is some</i>
<i>  incredible control.</i>

1:19:35.238 --> 1:19:38.272
<i> [kenny] he's trying to get him</i>
<i>  on top of the upper deck,</i>
<i>  chris.</i>

1:19:38.274 --> 1:19:39.573
<i>  Can he do it?</i>

1:19:39.575 --> 1:19:40.741
[audience cheering]

1:19:40.743 --> 1:19:42.309
<i> [chris] there's your answer.</i>

1:19:43.679 --> 1:19:45.045
<i>  Can bloodsport find a way</i>

1:19:45.047 --> 1:19:47.014
<i>  to get off of there, kenny?</i>

1:19:47.016 --> 1:19:49.116
<i>  That's like a fish</i>
<i>  out of water.</i>

1:19:49.118 --> 1:19:51.852
<i>  Can it work its way out?</i>

1:19:51.854 --> 1:19:53.454
<i> [kenny] they're doing</i>
<i>  their best to try to get</i>

1:19:53.456 --> 1:19:56.190
<i>  that weapon,</i>
<i>  to try to self-right, but...</i>

1:19:56.192 --> 1:19:57.992
<i>  I don't think they're</i>
<i>  going to be able to, chris.</i>

1:19:57.994 --> 1:20:00.961
<i>  This is just matt vasquez at</i>
<i>  a different level right now.</i>

1:20:00.963 --> 1:20:02.730
<i> [chris] so they're going to</i>
<i>  avoid the...</i>

1:20:02.732 --> 1:20:04.131
<i>  They are not.</i>

1:20:04.133 --> 1:20:06.567
<i>  Matty vasquez and whiplash,</i>

1:20:06.569 --> 1:20:09.069
<i>  last season's runner-up has</i>

1:20:09.071 --> 1:20:12.139
<i>  a ko in its first go-around.</i>

1:20:12.141 --> 1:20:14.241
[referee] ...One.
That's a knockout!

1:20:14.243 --> 1:20:16.544
[audience cheering]

1:20:20.616 --> 1:20:23.517
nice job. Great job.

1:20:25.054 --> 1:20:27.221
You're a wizard.
That was awesome.

1:20:30.793 --> 1:20:32.827
<i> [chris] kenny, we're used to</i>
<i>  seeing matt vasquez</i>

1:20:32.829 --> 1:20:36.297
<i>  dominate matches</i>
<i>  with his world-class driving.</i>

1:20:36.299 --> 1:20:38.566
<i>  However, we are not</i>
<i>  accustomed to seeing</i>

1:20:38.568 --> 1:20:40.534
<i>  one of his opponents</i>
<i>  go toe to toe</i>

1:20:40.536 --> 1:20:42.403
<i>  with him in that department.</i>

1:20:42.405 --> 1:20:45.940
<i> [kenny] no way. Justin marple</i>
<i>  was in the zone tonight.</i>

1:20:45.942 --> 1:20:48.709
<i>  He found the space bloodsport</i>
<i>  needed to spin up</i>

1:20:48.711 --> 1:20:50.911
<i>  and land a bunch</i>
<i>  of clean shots.</i>

1:20:50.913 --> 1:20:53.214
<i> [chris] did whiplash actually</i>
<i>  need this knockout?</i>

1:20:53.216 --> 1:20:55.115
<i> [kenny] listen, I thought</i>
<i>  bloodsport was ahead</i>

1:20:55.117 --> 1:20:57.351
<i>  on damage near</i>
<i>  the end of the fight.</i>

1:20:57.353 --> 1:20:59.186
<i>  This could have been</i>
<i>  dicey for whiplash</i>

1:20:59.188 --> 1:21:01.055
<i>  if it had gone to the judges.</i>

1:21:01.057 --> 1:21:02.489
<i>  But the bottom line is,</i>

1:21:02.491 --> 1:21:04.458
<i>  matt made sure</i>
<i>  that didn't happen</i>

1:21:04.460 --> 1:21:07.962
<i>  and proved why he's the best</i>
<i>  driver in the world.</i>

1:21:07.964 --> 1:21:10.931
<i> [chris] and you know what?</i>
<i>  Few guys can stick</i>
<i>  to a plant better</i>

1:21:10.933 --> 1:21:13.234
<i>  than matty vasquez.</i>
<i>  It's as simple as that.</i>

1:21:13.236 --> 1:21:14.435
<i> [kenny] yeah, I mean,</i>
<i>  he could place</i>

1:21:14.437 --> 1:21:15.903
<i>  that bot wherever he wants,</i>

1:21:15.905 --> 1:21:17.171
<i>  and even worse,</i>
<i>  he could place</i>

1:21:17.173 --> 1:21:19.006
<i>  the other bot</i>
<i>  wherever he wants.</i>

1:21:19.008 --> 1:21:21.041
<i> [chris] and that was bad news</i>
<i>  for bloodsport,</i>

1:21:21.043 --> 1:21:23.477
<i>  which unfortunately</i>
<i>  got a really nice tour</i>

1:21:23.479 --> 1:21:25.779
<i>  of our brand-new</i>
<i>  upper deck.</i>

1:21:25.781 --> 1:21:26.947
<i> Do you like the view up there?</i>

1:21:26.949 --> 1:21:29.850
<i> [kenny] unbelievable.</i>
<i>  Matty called this shot.</i>

1:21:29.852 --> 1:21:32.486
<i> [chris] it's the one time</i>
<i>  you don't want to hang out</i>
<i>  in the penthouse suite.</i>

1:21:36.125 --> 1:21:37.925
<i> -[chris] matt.</i>
<i> -Hey.</i>

1:21:37.927 --> 1:21:40.728
Hey, your dad just
called you a wizard.

1:21:40.730 --> 1:21:42.329
Do you understand why?

1:21:43.432 --> 1:21:44.632
Uh, I guess.

1:21:44.634 --> 1:21:46.400
What do you mean, you guess?

1:21:46.402 --> 1:21:49.637
I mean, that was a masterclass
in driving, was it not?

1:21:49.639 --> 1:21:52.206
Yeah, I felt like I did
exactly what I needed to.

1:21:52.208 --> 1:21:53.974
I've had a lot of fights
really similar to this.

1:21:53.976 --> 1:21:56.277
I fought, you know,
son of whyachi,
really similar robot.

1:21:56.279 --> 1:21:58.646
I did the same thing
in this fight that I did
in that fight.

1:21:58.648 --> 1:21:59.813
Every time I hit them,

1:21:59.815 --> 1:22:01.482
they're taking pieces
off of me,

1:22:01.484 --> 1:22:03.417
so I need to get them
over and out

1:22:03.419 --> 1:22:04.518
as soon as possible

1:22:04.520 --> 1:22:06.086
because if this fight
goes to three minutes,

1:22:06.088 --> 1:22:08.155
they're just going to
wear me down till I'm done.
Yeah.

1:22:08.157 --> 1:22:10.624
So I got to knock them out.
That's the only way to do it.

1:22:10.626 --> 1:22:12.226
Matt, you actually
made history.

1:22:12.228 --> 1:22:15.062
You are the first bot
to deliver a knockout

1:22:15.064 --> 1:22:17.031
on the upper deck.
Whoo!

1:22:17.033 --> 1:22:18.065
Yeah, right.

1:22:18.067 --> 1:22:20.501
-That... That was actually--
-great job.

1:22:20.503 --> 1:22:21.602
Yeah.

1:22:21.604 --> 1:22:23.437
-Hey, congratulations.
-That's a bucket list.

1:22:23.439 --> 1:22:25.606
That's a bucket list.
You can check that one off.

1:22:25.608 --> 1:22:26.707
Congratulations, guys.

1:22:26.709 --> 1:22:28.275
-We'll see you
in your next fight.
-Thank you.

1:22:28.277 --> 1:22:29.343
Thank you.

1:22:33.683 --> 1:22:36.350
Kenny, listen, people come
and watch battlebots

1:22:36.352 --> 1:22:39.086
'cause they love to see
the explosions, the fire
and all that,

1:22:39.088 --> 1:22:42.289
<i>  but sometimes</i>
<i>  the display of driving</i>
<i>  like we just saw</i>

1:22:42.291 --> 1:22:43.724
<i>  from these two teams,</i>

1:22:43.726 --> 1:22:45.559
<i>  can be just as exciting.</i>

1:22:45.561 --> 1:22:48.128
<i>  That was some great stuff.</i>

1:22:48.130 --> 1:22:51.465
<i>  And it was another incredible</i>
<i>  slate of qualifying action</i>

1:22:51.467 --> 1:22:52.967
<i>  here in las vegas.</i>

1:22:52.969 --> 1:22:56.170
<i>  It is going to be</i>
<i>  an all-out dogfight</i>

1:22:56.172 --> 1:22:58.739
<i>  as the field continues</i>
<i>  to duke it out</i>

1:22:58.741 --> 1:23:00.774
<i>  for the coveted 32 spots</i>

1:23:00.776 --> 1:23:03.711
<i>  in this year's</i>
<i> world championship tournament.</i>

1:23:03.713 --> 1:23:06.747
<i>  So, enjoy the ride.</i>

1:23:06.749 --> 1:23:08.415
-Did you have fun tonight?
-Oh, I had a blast.

1:23:08.417 --> 1:23:09.883
-You wouldn't
lie to me, right?
-Huh?

1:23:09.885 --> 1:23:11.752
-You wouldn't lie to me.
-No, no,

1:23:11.754 --> 1:23:13.220
-I wouldn't, of course not.
-No, no.

1:23:13.222 --> 1:23:16.056
So for faruq
and our bot whisperer, pete,

1:23:16.058 --> 1:23:18.659
and my man, kenny florian,
who never lies to me
apparently,

1:23:18.661 --> 1:23:19.760
I am chris rose.

1:23:19.762 --> 1:23:21.795
We'll see you next time
on battlebots.

1:23:21.797 --> 1:23:23.897
[audience cheering]

1:23:23.899 --> 1:23:26.100
