WEBVTT

00:01.120 --> 00:03.620
Previously on "How To Get Away
With Murder"...

00:03.620 --> 00:05.210
They're her
therapy sessions with Sam.

00:05.210 --> 00:05.960
Young Annalise: Solomon Vick was
screwing our client's wife.

00:05.960 --> 00:07.250
Got her pregnant, too.

00:07.250 --> 00:09.290
Your dad wasn't the client,
Michaela.

00:09.290 --> 00:10.710
He's the lawyer.

00:10.710 --> 00:12.710
Denver was keeping files
on all of you.

00:12.710 --> 00:14.000
I destroyed them
already.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.960
So no yelling at me
for hiring Bonnie.

00:15.960 --> 00:18.380
Can I yell at you for not
telling me that you have a wife?

00:18.380 --> 00:20.170
You recognize this girl?

00:20.170 --> 00:21.540
Felix:
They said they'd kill me

00:21.540 --> 00:22.710
if I talked to anyone
about where I dropped her.

00:22.710 --> 00:24.580
Hey, Frank.

00:24.580 --> 00:26.210
You need to give us help
to close one of ours.

00:26.210 --> 00:28.210
What case?
Annalise Keating.

00:28.210 --> 00:29.880
We have a dead informant
on our hands, Michaela.

00:35.250 --> 00:36.460
I need help in here!

00:36.460 --> 00:38.170
Help! Help!

00:38.170 --> 00:42.000
Connor, Connor.
Stay with me, Connor.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.540
It's gonna be okay. You're okay.
What's going on?!
Is Connor okay?!

00:45.540 --> 00:48.120
Someone answer me,
please!

00:48.120 --> 00:51.920
What's wrong with Connor?!
Tell me what's wrong!

00:51.920 --> 00:56.080
Please, Connor.
No, no, no.

01:22.170 --> 01:23.670
Banker:
Bermuda North Atlantic Bank.

01:23.670 --> 01:26.080
May I please have
your personal access code?

01:26.080 --> 01:31.500
Bravo, Bravo, Tango,
Whiskey, Echo, 8-1-1-2.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.000
Thank you.
How may I help you today?

01:33.000 --> 01:35.210
I'd like to make a transfer
into my account.

01:35.210 --> 01:36.960
Certainly.
What was the amount?

01:36.960 --> 01:38.670
$50,000.

01:38.670 --> 01:39.830
Young Annalise: Maybe I've just
been using Eve

01:39.830 --> 01:42.120
as some kind of an escape.

01:42.120 --> 01:43.750
Young Sam:
An escape from what?

01:43.750 --> 01:46.380
Me. Hating myself.

01:46.380 --> 01:48.170
You don't hate yourself
around Eve?

01:48.170 --> 01:51.000
No. I like myself more
when I'm with her.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.420
What's the problem
with liking yourself?

01:53.420 --> 01:54.580
Liking myself
isn't the problem.

01:54.580 --> 01:56.500
It's how I got there.

01:56.500 --> 01:59.500
You mean falling in love
with Eve?

01:59.500 --> 02:01.540
Falling in love
with a woman.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.540
That crap might fly
in a white family, but mine...

02:05.540 --> 02:07.290
My father would stick me
in a mental clinic

02:07.290 --> 02:09.540
if he found out.

02:09.540 --> 02:11.040
And why does your
father's opinion of you matter

02:11.040 --> 02:13.540
if you're happy?

02:13.540 --> 02:16.460
I didn't say I was happy.

02:17.920 --> 02:20.710
Wake 'n bake, baby!
Ooh!

02:20.710 --> 02:22.500
Uh, it's a work day.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.500
A work day.
What's that?

02:24.500 --> 02:26.790
You know, someone at C&G
is gonna notice that you
haven't been there in weeks.

02:26.790 --> 02:27.920
Until then,

02:27.920 --> 02:30.540
I'm just gonna get high
and bake cookies!

02:30.540 --> 02:33.120
Okay, everybody out.
I've got to pack.
For what?

02:33.120 --> 02:34.750
Gabriel got us a cabin
in the Poconos for the weekend.

02:34.750 --> 02:36.000
Oh, can I come?
Ooh, sexy.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.330
No.

02:37.330 --> 02:38.670
Oh, get him to take
a pic of his --

02:38.670 --> 02:41.040
Okay. No. Get out.
I said out.
You don't want --

02:41.040 --> 02:42.250
-Out! Get out!
-I was --

02:42.250 --> 02:43.540
Yeah.

02:43.540 --> 02:46.540
Annalise,
are you in love with Eve?

02:46.540 --> 02:49.540
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just running

02:49.540 --> 02:52.040
from everything
that happened to me.

02:52.040 --> 02:54.250
Your uncle? The abuse?

02:54.250 --> 02:56.330
Of course.

02:56.330 --> 02:58.710
Happy first day
of the new job!

02:58.710 --> 03:00.500
Here's some Buster's
to start the day,

03:00.500 --> 03:01.960
greased up
and ready to work.

03:01.960 --> 03:03.380
I'm too nervous to eat.

03:03.380 --> 03:06.330
Aww. Everyone at C&G's
gonna love you, BonBon.

03:06.330 --> 03:07.790
And if they don't,

03:07.790 --> 03:09.790
they're gonna have to
answer to me.
Thank you.

03:09.790 --> 03:12.170
But you're just here
to get a ride, right?

03:12.170 --> 03:14.750
Yeah.

03:14.750 --> 03:17.330
Happy masturbating,
Franky!

03:17.330 --> 03:18.290
He didn't come home
last night.

03:18.290 --> 03:20.000
One-night stand?
Probably.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.620
Let's go.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.960
Can I offer you
an alternative?

03:25.960 --> 03:27.750
That you're with Eve

03:27.750 --> 03:29.540
not because
you're running from men,

03:29.540 --> 03:32.170
but because you're running
to somewhere safe.

03:32.170 --> 03:33.750
Banker:
Okay, we're all set.

03:33.750 --> 03:36.420
The transfer has gone through.
And the balance?

03:36.420 --> 03:39.380
With the current exchange rate,
$208,000.

03:39.380 --> 03:41.750
Thank you.

04:17.880 --> 04:19.290
Nate: You get something
on Price?

04:19.290 --> 04:21.080
No. It's about
Ronald Miller.

04:21.080 --> 04:23.080
We have new evidence
leading us to believe

04:23.080 --> 04:25.250
that he was not involved
in your father's death.

04:25.250 --> 04:26.620
What evidence?

04:26.620 --> 04:28.620
Something that will help close
your father's case.

04:28.620 --> 04:31.330
But first you need to help us
close one of ours.

04:31.330 --> 04:32.670
What case?

04:32.670 --> 04:34.210
Annalise Keating.

04:35.620 --> 04:37.620
You're the FBI.

04:37.620 --> 04:39.250
If there's a reason
to take Annalise down,

04:39.250 --> 04:40.670
I'm sure you can do it
without my help.

04:40.670 --> 04:43.000
Why do you keep sacrificing
yourself for her, Nate?

04:43.000 --> 04:45.420
Before you met her,
you were a respected detective.

04:45.420 --> 04:46.580
Leadership was eyeing you
for Captain.

04:46.580 --> 04:47.620
What's your point?

04:47.620 --> 04:48.880
That your entire career
was ruined

04:48.880 --> 04:50.460
because Annalise Keating
framed you

04:50.460 --> 04:52.080
for her husband's murder.

04:52.080 --> 04:53.830
You have to want something
better for yourself

04:53.830 --> 04:55.540
than whatever it is
you do these days.

04:55.540 --> 04:57.460
I want my pops' case solved.
That's what I want.

04:57.460 --> 05:00.250
So do we.

05:00.250 --> 05:02.330
Just give us something
on Annalise.

05:02.330 --> 05:06.170
And, hell, there might even be
a job for you here.

05:06.170 --> 05:10.620
Special Agent Lahey.
It sounds good, right?

05:19.210 --> 05:21.080
Tegan: Carl, everyone
at Flirt Inferno

05:21.080 --> 05:24.250
is sensitive to your complaint,
but under Section 230

05:24.250 --> 05:26.250
under the Communications
Decency Act,

05:26.250 --> 05:28.080
Ms. Turpin
cannot be held liable

05:28.080 --> 05:31.080
for any discrimination felt
from the app's other users.

05:31.080 --> 05:34.920
That said, we are prepared
to offer you $50,000.

05:34.920 --> 05:36.000
As part
of the settlement,

05:36.000 --> 05:37.790
obviously Ms. Turpin
will admit no liability.

05:37.790 --> 05:39.210
Standard NDAs apply.

05:39.210 --> 05:42.620
$50,000 so your client
can discriminate against mine?

05:42.620 --> 05:45.620
My app unites people.
It does not discriminate.

05:45.620 --> 05:47.420
Then why does it only pair me
with disabled women?

05:47.420 --> 05:48.790
The users tell us
what they want,

05:48.790 --> 05:49.960
and we give it to them.

05:49.960 --> 05:51.960
I can't help it
if they're prejudiced.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.540
But you profit off
that prejudice and --

05:53.540 --> 05:55.750
Tegan: Flirt Inferno
is a digital platform,

05:55.750 --> 05:57.540
which means it has
statutory immunity

05:57.540 --> 05:59.500
from any bias
its users demonstrate.

05:59.500 --> 06:01.420
Take the 50K.

06:01.420 --> 06:04.420
How are you okay with this?

06:04.420 --> 06:06.250
The law is the law.

06:06.250 --> 06:07.880
You changed the law
at the Supreme Court

06:07.880 --> 06:09.500
on behalf of
poor people of color.

06:09.500 --> 06:12.000
Now you're okay persecuting
a disabled man?

06:12.000 --> 06:14.210
Since when is having
trouble dating persecution?

06:17.790 --> 06:19.790
This is
an amended complaint

06:19.790 --> 06:21.380
under Title II
of the Civil Rights Act.

06:21.380 --> 06:23.540
What civil rights
are being violated?

06:23.540 --> 06:24.750
My client
is being humiliated

06:24.750 --> 06:26.580
in a place
of public accommodation.

06:26.580 --> 06:29.000
It's on a dating app, Zeke,
not in a restaurant.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.580
We're arguing
discrimination laws

06:30.580 --> 06:32.830
applicable
to physical spaces

06:32.830 --> 06:34.670
should be applied
to digital ones, as well.

06:34.670 --> 06:36.460
How much money
do you want, Carl?

06:36.460 --> 06:37.960
$75,000? $100,000?

06:37.960 --> 06:39.460
I don't want any money.

06:39.460 --> 06:42.000
I want a fair shot at love,
just like everyone else.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
That's something
I can't give you.
You can.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.790
If you rewrite
your algorithm

06:45.790 --> 06:47.880
to be more sensitive
to people like myself.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.460
Zeke:
We'll give you 48 hours

06:49.460 --> 06:51.040
to agree to change
the algorithm,

06:51.040 --> 06:53.290
or we file in court.

06:56.170 --> 06:57.830
Tegan: Wake up!

06:57.830 --> 07:00.420
C&G just took on
a civil rights case,

07:00.420 --> 07:03.080
and we are tapping
your brilliant minds to help.

07:03.080 --> 07:05.290
Cool.
Civil rights is my forte.

07:05.290 --> 07:07.080
Too bad it's one of our clients
violating them.

07:07.080 --> 07:08.460
No one's
violating anything.

07:08.460 --> 07:10.460
Robert?
Yeah.

07:10.460 --> 07:12.790
Robert Hsieh, in-house counsel
for Flirt Inferno --

07:12.790 --> 07:13.960
Asher:
I use Flirt Inferno.

07:13.960 --> 07:15.580
That's great.
Then you know it's not biased.

07:15.580 --> 07:17.750
Now we just got to find
some precedents to support that.

07:17.750 --> 07:20.580
Uh, question. When did
this clinic stop being about

07:20.580 --> 07:21.880
helping
the underprivileged?

07:21.880 --> 07:23.750
Annalise: You mean
when Tegan drove to Maryland

07:23.750 --> 07:26.120
to stop your dumb ass from
getting our clients deported?

07:26.120 --> 07:28.920
Now, uh, this is the first time
I've ever heard of

07:28.920 --> 07:31.290
anti-discrimination laws
for physical spaces

07:31.290 --> 07:32.920
being applied
to the Internet.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.920
So we are in
a whole new frontier of law.

07:35.920 --> 07:38.920
Just not
the final frontier.

07:38.920 --> 07:42.330
That would be space law, right?

07:42.330 --> 07:44.330
And when the laws fail us,

07:44.330 --> 07:46.330
then we'll find dirt
on our plaintiff

07:46.330 --> 07:48.330
to shut him up.
The disabled guy?

07:48.330 --> 07:51.380
Just get Oliver to dig.
Where is he?

07:51.380 --> 07:53.040
Working from home.
I never approved that.

07:53.040 --> 07:56.080
Get him here now.

07:56.080 --> 07:59.500
Oliver: ♪ And
now and then, I fall apart ♪

07:59.500 --> 08:03.210
♪ And I need you now tonight ♪

08:03.210 --> 08:06.290
♪ And I need you
more than ever ♪

08:06.290 --> 08:10.290
♪ And if you only
hold me tight ♪

08:10.290 --> 08:12.790
♪ We'll be holding on forever ♪

08:14.170 --> 08:16.960
♪ And we'll only be
making it right ♪

08:16.960 --> 08:18.960
You miss your sexy boo-thang
already?

08:18.960 --> 08:20.790
Connor:
Not me. Tegan.

08:20.790 --> 08:22.420
The jig is up.
And bring Michaela

08:22.420 --> 08:24.380
so she can see me
flirting up an inferno.

08:24.380 --> 08:26.830
Um, she's not here.

08:26.830 --> 08:28.380
What? Where is she?

08:28.380 --> 08:30.880
Gabriel rented a cabin
in the Poconos.

08:30.880 --> 08:33.210
They'll be back Sunday.

08:36.920 --> 08:39.330
You paid how much
for these tickets?
It's fine.

08:39.330 --> 08:41.750
I'll be able to afford my own
island once I prove paternity.

08:41.750 --> 08:42.790
Excuse me.

08:42.790 --> 08:45.000
Sorry.
So what's the plan?

08:45.000 --> 08:47.540
You gonna rush the stage,
yank some of his hair out?

08:47.540 --> 08:49.380
No. I just need
his water bottle.

08:49.380 --> 08:51.540
Why not just talk to the guy?
He'll deny everything.

08:51.540 --> 08:52.670
You don't know that.

08:52.670 --> 08:54.290
This is the man
who knocked up my mother,

08:54.290 --> 08:56.290
let her get shot,
then allowed his own daughter

08:56.290 --> 08:58.120
to be raised
by white-trash swamp people.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.580
Now he needs to pay me
for his sins.

09:00.580 --> 09:02.420
What if you want
more than just his money?

09:02.420 --> 09:03.580
You sound stupid.

09:03.580 --> 09:05.000
Shh!

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
Thank you. Thank you.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.710
Welcome.

09:11.710 --> 09:14.420
I couldn't be more excited
about our keynote speaker.

09:14.420 --> 09:17.000
He's a lawyer,
venture capitalist,

09:17.000 --> 09:19.210
disrupter, a change-maker.

09:19.210 --> 09:21.000
And the tech gods
in Silicon Valley

09:21.000 --> 09:23.210
refer to him as
"the Money Magnet."

09:24.580 --> 09:28.540
Oh, and he also calls himself
a feminist. Fourth wave.

09:28.540 --> 09:30.250
Without further ado,

09:30.250 --> 09:32.670
please give a warm welcome
to Solomon Vick.

09:38.830 --> 09:40.460
Good to see you.
You too.

09:40.460 --> 09:43.210
She left out next
President of the United States!

09:53.170 --> 09:54.830
Solomon, let's talk about
your sudden interest

09:54.830 --> 09:56.040
in the women's space.

09:56.040 --> 09:57.580
Oh, my interest in women
is not sudden, Kelly.

09:58.790 --> 10:00.580
Business-wise, you've
taken on a feminist mantle,

10:00.580 --> 10:01.960
something many women
in this audience

10:01.960 --> 10:03.580
might find self-serving.

10:03.580 --> 10:07.040
Let's be clear --
women have no power.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.250
Quite frankly,

10:08.250 --> 10:10.120
it's my belief
they never will.

10:10.120 --> 10:11.290
Expand.

10:11.290 --> 10:13.330
Power comes from money,
and today

10:13.330 --> 10:16.580
only 3% of venture funds
go to women-led businesses,

10:16.580 --> 10:20.580
with 2.2% almost exclusively
going to white women.

10:20.580 --> 10:22.580
The only people to blame
for this inequality

10:22.580 --> 10:25.880
are rich, powerful,
historically selfish men.

10:25.880 --> 10:26.880
I kinda like him.

10:26.880 --> 10:28.080
So you're saying
it's up to men

10:28.080 --> 10:30.750
to save women
from this predicament?

10:30.750 --> 10:33.880
What I'm saying is, men
typically invest their money,

10:33.880 --> 10:35.250
while women donate it.

10:35.250 --> 10:37.880
Now, until that changes,
it's on men

10:37.880 --> 10:40.580
to right the financial wrongs
that they created,

10:40.580 --> 10:44.420
and the best way to do that
is to invest in women.

10:44.420 --> 10:46.670
Well, how do you
personally plan to do that?

10:46.670 --> 10:47.920
As of today,

10:47.920 --> 10:51.920
Vick Capital is opening
a $500 million fund

10:51.920 --> 10:55.120
to invest solely
in women entrepreneurs.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.460
Now, who wants some of that?

10:56.460 --> 10:58.420
Anybody?

10:58.420 --> 11:02.460
Because I cannot wait
to give it away.

11:04.960 --> 11:07.750
I'm here. I'm here.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.790
Michaela's dead body
show up on the porch yet?
Nope.

11:09.790 --> 11:11.000
Are you still high?
Yup.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.170
What am I doing?
Digging up dirt on this guy.

11:15.380 --> 11:17.960
So we're the evil empire
again. Great.

11:17.960 --> 11:19.460
I don't think
we're the bad guys here.

11:19.460 --> 11:21.080
I've been swiping left and right
on this thing,

11:21.080 --> 11:22.670
and not one of sign
of discrimination yet.

11:22.670 --> 11:24.380
You're able-bodied.
And white.

11:24.380 --> 11:26.170
Try using a dating app
when you're an Asian guy.

11:26.170 --> 11:27.750
Well, it's not the app's fault
that people are horrible.

11:27.750 --> 11:29.380
Connor:
I'm not sure about that.

11:29.380 --> 11:31.790
The app asks, "Would you date
someone without a steady job?"

11:31.790 --> 11:33.420
That's a biased question.

11:33.420 --> 11:34.880
The unemployment rate
for people with disabilities

11:34.880 --> 11:37.080
is more than twice the rate
of people without disability --

11:37.080 --> 11:39.540
Booya! Take a look
at this matchy-match!

11:39.540 --> 11:41.920
Would you be that excited
if she weren't a super-model?

11:41.920 --> 11:43.080
I'm not gonna discriminate
against a woman

11:43.080 --> 11:45.290
just 'cause
she's "foine."

11:45.290 --> 11:48.420
"Dearest
Lacey, how honored I feeleth

11:48.420 --> 11:50.080
to match with a woman
as beauteous as you."

11:52.000 --> 11:54.170
Annalise:
Here's how we can be done
with this case real fast --

11:54.170 --> 11:56.210
Heidi changes
the algorithm.

11:56.210 --> 11:57.880
Nah, she's not gonna do that.
Why not?

11:57.880 --> 12:00.080
She's been designing that thing
for 10 years.

12:00.080 --> 12:01.960
Doesn't mean
it's not trash.

12:01.960 --> 12:04.620
Annalise.
No, no. No, she's right.
I agree.

12:04.620 --> 12:06.710
I'd die before using
any dating app.

12:06.710 --> 12:09.500
That's something only
a good-looking man could say.

12:09.500 --> 12:12.670
You think I'm good-looking?
Let's just work.

12:12.670 --> 12:15.250
So, what do you think,
Annalise?
You're okay.

12:15.250 --> 12:16.960
No, I meant,
what are your feelings

12:16.960 --> 12:18.080
about online dating?

12:19.620 --> 12:21.000
Assuming you're single.

12:22.540 --> 12:25.040
Here's my
executive decision --

12:25.040 --> 12:27.420
we file this response
under tortious interference,

12:27.420 --> 12:29.830
prove there's economic harm
to Heidi's business.

12:29.830 --> 12:31.000
See what you think.

12:38.210 --> 12:40.670
Danielle said you needed me?
Yes.

12:40.670 --> 12:43.250
Bullet-point the Communications
Decency Act for me

12:43.250 --> 12:45.830
and any cases involving
public-accommodations protection

12:45.830 --> 12:47.080
extending
to the digital space.

12:47.080 --> 12:49.290
Sure.
What's the case?

12:49.290 --> 12:51.580
Flirt Inferno.
File's upstairs on my desk.

12:51.580 --> 12:53.830
Mess up,
and you're fired.

13:19.670 --> 13:21.120
What's this?

13:21.120 --> 13:24.670
Tegan's divorce papers.
All her financials are listed.

13:24.670 --> 13:28.250
Maybe there's something
linking her to Jorge or Xavier.

13:28.250 --> 13:30.250
Not bad
for your first day.

13:30.250 --> 13:31.790
Just see
what you can find.

13:38.460 --> 13:40.500
Nate: Here.

13:45.330 --> 13:46.960
Lanford: How do Tegan Price's
divorce papers

13:46.960 --> 13:48.710
help us with our case
against Keating?

13:48.710 --> 13:51.880
They don't, but they might
help me solve my pops' murder.

13:51.880 --> 13:54.080
Nate --
She has her assets listed.
Follow the money.

13:54.080 --> 13:55.880
It probably leads to
the Castillos, the Governor.

13:55.880 --> 13:57.040
Norris:
Even if that's true,

13:57.040 --> 13:58.790
I assume she didn't just
give you these?

14:01.040 --> 14:04.670
You want my help.
First you need to help me.

14:09.330 --> 14:12.080
$20 almonds?
Why, yes, Daddy Warbucks.

14:12.080 --> 14:15.170
We should order
room service.

14:15.170 --> 14:17.750
How many lobsters
do you want?

14:19.420 --> 14:21.170
What'd you say?

14:21.170 --> 14:24.330
You know,
you don't have to stay.

14:24.330 --> 14:26.330
I mean it.
I'm fine doing this alone.

14:26.330 --> 14:29.460
Well, it's too late.
I'm here for you.

14:31.380 --> 14:33.330
What are they
talking about now?

14:33.330 --> 14:36.330
You want to listen?
Ew, no, it's weird.

14:36.330 --> 14:37.580
So I'm weird. Got it.

14:37.580 --> 14:41.000
Okay, maybe just
for a second.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.040
Young Sam:
How's the sex?

14:43.040 --> 14:45.040
Young Annalise: I don't
want to talk about that.

14:45.040 --> 14:47.620
You were sexually abused.
It's important.

14:47.620 --> 14:50.210
I didn't know they were
gonna talk about this.

14:50.210 --> 14:51.420
When you're
having sex with Eve,

14:51.420 --> 14:54.420
do you dissociate
or do you enjoy it?

14:54.420 --> 14:56.330
Both.

14:56.330 --> 15:00.170
So you'd say
Eve makes you feel good?

15:00.170 --> 15:02.880
Sexually speaking?

15:02.880 --> 15:04.580
Can we please talk
about something else?

15:04.580 --> 15:06.420
Understanding
how you react to sex

15:06.420 --> 15:09.790
is critical to understanding
your trauma, Annalise.

15:09.790 --> 15:12.170
Eve makes me feel safe.

15:12.170 --> 15:14.170
How does it feel?

15:14.170 --> 15:16.000
Hmm?
Getting hit on at work.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.580
It's like the fool
hasn't heard of "Me Too."

15:17.580 --> 15:19.000
Well,
if he was hitting on me,

15:19.000 --> 15:20.500
it's only 'cause
he works for the FBI.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.880
'Cause no one can actually
find you attractive?

15:22.880 --> 15:23.790
Is this about your wife?

15:23.790 --> 15:25.170
She calls you once,

15:25.170 --> 15:26.620
and now all you see is sex
everywhere you look?

15:26.620 --> 15:27.620
Stop.
Why don't you call her?

15:27.620 --> 15:30.620
What could it hurt?

15:30.620 --> 15:33.120
Because she's seeing
someone else.

15:34.580 --> 15:35.330
Patrick.

15:35.330 --> 15:37.000
Ohh.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.170
Sign the damn papers
already.

15:39.170 --> 15:41.620
We won the case.
Carl's an incel.

15:41.620 --> 15:43.080
A what?

15:43.080 --> 15:44.080
"Involuntary celibate."

15:44.080 --> 15:45.500
They're men who blame women

15:45.500 --> 15:47.120
for not wanting to
have sex with them.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.830
Carl wrote all of these
terrible things online.

15:52.380 --> 15:53.790
I hate the world.

15:53.790 --> 15:55.380
Yeah, but not as much
as Carl hates women,

15:55.380 --> 15:58.000
which means
he's a very bad, bad man.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.580
We win.

16:05.960 --> 16:07.880
I assume you've decided
to change the algorithm?

16:07.880 --> 16:09.710
No. What we've decided

16:09.710 --> 16:12.120
is to spare Carl
from a public stoning.

16:12.120 --> 16:14.080
He just needs to
drop the suit.

16:14.080 --> 16:15.290
Why would I do that?

16:15.290 --> 16:17.120
"Women are hopeless femoids

16:17.120 --> 16:18.880
who'll never be
a man's mental equal."

16:18.880 --> 16:20.210
"Girls like rape

16:20.210 --> 16:22.460
'cause they're just whores
who want it rough."

16:22.460 --> 16:23.830
Just imagine how much harder
it's gonna be

16:23.830 --> 16:26.250
for you to get a date,
let alone win a lawsuit.

16:26.250 --> 16:27.750
Carl: The only reason
I became an incel

16:27.750 --> 16:30.120
is because I was sick
of all the rejection

16:30.120 --> 16:33.040
that I experienced as a result
of your bigoted algorithm.

16:33.040 --> 16:34.460
You are the bigot.

16:34.460 --> 16:35.880
Okay,
we'll see you in court.

16:35.880 --> 16:37.500
You'll lose.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.920
It's not against the law
for me to be an incel,

16:39.920 --> 16:41.920
but it is to discriminate
against one.

16:41.920 --> 16:43.040
I'll give you
a million dollars.

16:43.040 --> 16:44.330
You can't buy me.

16:44.330 --> 16:46.170
$5 million.
Say a number.

16:46.170 --> 16:48.330
This has never been
about the money.

16:48.330 --> 16:50.500
I just want
the algorithm changed.

17:03.250 --> 17:06.210
She's only into you
for your money, jackass.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Asher: So what's
the appropriate waiting time

17:38.000 --> 17:39.830
before I ask to move
into Laurel's room?

17:39.830 --> 17:41.790
You're not gonna miss listening
to Michaela and Gabriel

17:41.790 --> 17:43.210
hook up
through the wall?

17:43.210 --> 17:45.830
I don't listen
to them...usually.

17:45.830 --> 17:47.670
What are you doing?

17:47.670 --> 17:48.790
Researching
the local gays.

17:48.790 --> 17:50.120
How rude.

17:50.120 --> 17:52.120
Us singles are out here
trying to find love,

17:52.120 --> 17:53.040
and you two are
on there just --

17:53.040 --> 17:54.880
Looking for sex.

17:54.880 --> 17:57.670
What?
Yeah. What?

17:57.670 --> 17:58.750
I'm open if you are.

17:58.750 --> 18:00.210
To a threesome?

18:00.210 --> 18:01.750
Quiet. Since when?
Since forever.

18:01.750 --> 18:04.380
You've never had one,
though.

18:04.380 --> 18:05.670
Oli, you've never done
a threesome?

18:05.670 --> 18:07.750
Ooh, we got a match.

18:07.750 --> 18:10.880
Hot.
PReP, positive-friendly.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.210
And he's got actual books
on his bookshelf.

18:12.210 --> 18:13.830
That's more hot.

18:13.830 --> 18:15.880
Should I message him?

18:15.880 --> 18:18.080
Look, the --
the FBI or the Castillos

18:18.080 --> 18:19.880
are gonna barge in here
any second,

18:19.880 --> 18:22.250
so we might as well give them
a show when they do.

18:22.250 --> 18:25.120
Yeah. Sure.
See if he responds.

18:25.120 --> 18:28.960
"Hey there, handsome.
Open to couples?"

18:30.120 --> 18:31.710
I hate being straight.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.670
Annalise:
You lied to me.

18:46.670 --> 18:48.210
No. No.

18:48.210 --> 18:51.120
I do speak fluent Klingon,
but I'm still not teaching you.

18:51.120 --> 18:54.750
You're on Flirt Inferno.

18:54.750 --> 18:55.960
As are you,
apparently.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.120
Oh, no,
just for research.

18:57.120 --> 18:58.540
I don't put my actual face
on this.

18:58.540 --> 19:00.540
No, no, no, you'd get
way too many matches.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.620
That's not the point.

19:02.620 --> 19:05.620
I know, Annalise.
This is called small talk.

19:05.620 --> 19:07.170
You really should
try it sometime.

19:07.170 --> 19:11.710
This isn't the only secret
you're keeping from me, is it?

19:11.710 --> 19:14.880
Heidi offered Carl $5 million
like it was nothing.

19:14.880 --> 19:17.000
But I looked up
Flirt Inferno's valuation --

19:17.000 --> 19:19.620
not impressive.

19:19.620 --> 19:22.830
So what are you
not telling us?

19:22.830 --> 19:24.000
You know I can't say.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.460
Again with the secrets.

19:26.460 --> 19:28.420
You know, you think
this little act is cute,

19:28.420 --> 19:30.380
but you're really
just pissing me off.

19:30.380 --> 19:33.380
Okay.

19:33.380 --> 19:35.330
She's betting
on her future.

19:35.330 --> 19:37.170
Meaning?

19:37.170 --> 19:38.960
Heidi is licensing
her algorithm

19:38.960 --> 19:40.960
to the U.S. government
for $50 million.

19:40.960 --> 19:43.330
$50 million?
We're in the wrong business.

19:43.330 --> 19:44.540
Only if you're okay

19:44.540 --> 19:46.500
with making money
off of discrimination.

19:46.500 --> 19:48.040
Oh, come on.

19:48.040 --> 19:49.880
The government is gonna use it
to weed out people of color

19:49.880 --> 19:52.000
from housing,
employment applications,

19:52.000 --> 19:54.040
all because an algorithm

19:54.040 --> 19:57.460
deems them
as less than desirable.

19:57.460 --> 19:59.250
You want that
to be part of your legacy?

19:59.250 --> 20:02.040
You've got some nerve
talking to me about legacy.

20:02.040 --> 20:04.620
Tegan, I know
I got blood on my hands,

20:04.620 --> 20:05.750
but now is the time

20:05.750 --> 20:07.710
that we have to make
things right.
We?

20:07.710 --> 20:09.710
That's your legacy, Annalise,
not mine.
Really?

20:09.710 --> 20:13.170
You wanna leave the world
worse off than you found it?

20:13.170 --> 20:16.330
I want power.
I'm not shy about that.

20:16.330 --> 20:19.500
We take on the world every day,
and it's still a mess.

20:19.500 --> 20:22.290
Unarmed black men killed
for daring to live...

20:22.290 --> 20:24.120
Yeah, but --
...and a legal system

20:24.120 --> 20:25.500
with enough loopholes
to drown in.

20:25.500 --> 20:29.120
So, yeah,
I want power to fix all of it.

20:29.120 --> 20:31.120
You don't need to sell out
to the highest bidder

20:31.120 --> 20:32.960
to do that.
I'm not selling out.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.120
I'm getting what's mine, what
I have worked very hard for.

20:35.120 --> 20:36.210
You hear me?

20:36.210 --> 20:38.080
I gave up a hell of a lot,

20:38.080 --> 20:40.620
and I'm not about to let
anyone snatch it away.

20:40.620 --> 20:44.880
So get off your soapbox
and help me win this damn case.

20:46.620 --> 20:49.580
Solomon: Most people try to
band-aid our parity problem.

20:49.580 --> 20:51.540
Now, they focus on equality,

20:51.540 --> 20:54.790
ensuring everyone has equal
access, instead of equity.

20:54.790 --> 20:56.210
How do you propose
we fix it?

20:56.210 --> 20:58.540
Besides the $500 million
I pledged yesterday?

20:58.540 --> 21:00.710
Money can't solve
everything.

21:00.710 --> 21:02.580
Well, then we need to act
on our beliefs,

21:02.580 --> 21:04.500
which is what my firm does.

21:04.500 --> 21:07.250
Now, we have wage parity among
my male and female employees,

21:07.250 --> 21:09.250
and I'm very proud
of that.

21:09.250 --> 21:10.380
Why are
they all clapping?

21:10.380 --> 21:12.080
He's a con man.
They can hear you.

21:12.080 --> 21:14.540
Good. They need to know.
Michaela.

21:14.540 --> 21:16.170
Excuse me, Mr. Vick.
I have a question.

21:16.170 --> 21:17.330
Actually,
let's wait until the Q&A.

21:17.330 --> 21:19.080
Mr. Vick,
you claim to be devoted

21:19.080 --> 21:20.670
to supporting women
in the professional space,

21:20.670 --> 21:22.250
but do you hold yourself
to that same standard

21:22.250 --> 21:23.620
in your own
personal life?

21:23.620 --> 21:26.580
Oh, wow.
Um, your name?

21:26.580 --> 21:28.620
Laurel Castillo.
Your answer?

21:28.620 --> 21:32.120
I have made it a personal goal
to hold myself to account

21:32.120 --> 21:34.710
in both my professional
and my personal life.

21:34.710 --> 21:37.080
So, professionally,
you've never, say,
slept with a client?

21:37.080 --> 21:38.670
Alright, let's move on --

21:38.670 --> 21:40.040
Sleeping with anyone involved
in a case you work on

21:40.040 --> 21:42.120
could get you disbarred.
I think I know that.

21:42.120 --> 21:43.920
So you have
or haven't?

21:43.920 --> 21:45.710
I have not.
Are you sure?

21:45.710 --> 21:47.250
I'm not sure
we're on topic.

21:47.250 --> 21:48.500
That behavior
would demonstrate

21:48.500 --> 21:50.290
an affinity for exploiting
vulnerable women.

21:50.290 --> 21:51.920
I would think
that could tarnish

21:51.920 --> 21:54.540
the feminist legacy
of the great Solomon Vick.

21:54.540 --> 21:55.710
Wouldn't you agree?

21:55.710 --> 21:56.960
I would.

21:56.960 --> 21:58.540
And any man
who does not agree

21:58.540 --> 22:02.000
should be fired, disbarred,
all of it.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.380
Now, does that answer
your question, Ms...?

22:04.380 --> 22:05.500
Castillo.

22:05.500 --> 22:08.330
Yes, I am very clear
on where you stand now.

22:08.330 --> 22:10.170
Carry on.

22:11.380 --> 22:12.790
Let's go over to Kibwe.

22:12.790 --> 22:15.120
What's your take on parity
in the corporate world?

22:18.120 --> 22:20.880
Let's call this a, uh,
bad news bear claw.

22:20.880 --> 22:22.290
I prefer a doughnut.

22:22.290 --> 22:24.380
I tried my best.

22:24.380 --> 22:26.170
Heidi refuses to change
the algorithm.

22:26.170 --> 22:27.920
Can't blame the woman.
She wants her money.

22:27.920 --> 22:30.170
Here's my Hail Mary --

22:30.170 --> 22:32.290
file a suit under
the Defend Trade Secrets Act

22:32.290 --> 22:33.460
and claim he acquired
the algorithm

22:33.460 --> 22:34.880
and misappropriated it.

22:34.880 --> 22:37.120
And get an ex parte order
to seize his property

22:37.120 --> 22:39.080
to prevent the dissemination
of the algorithm trade secret?

22:39.080 --> 22:40.500
Exactly.
No.

22:40.500 --> 22:42.330
Enough of you trying
to sabotage this case.

22:42.330 --> 22:44.330
I'm telling you
how to win.

22:44.330 --> 22:46.540
Carl wants women
like Heidi to burn?

22:47.960 --> 22:50.290
Let's give him
the match.

22:50.290 --> 22:52.540
Asher: Hey, Carl.
Uh, you don't know me.

22:52.540 --> 22:53.580
My name's Asher.

22:53.580 --> 22:55.830
You work at C&G.
What the hell is this?

22:55.830 --> 22:57.540
Look, I could get fired
for telling you this.
So don't.

22:57.540 --> 22:59.290
Heidi's selling her algorithm
for $50 mil.

22:59.290 --> 23:01.080
That's why she won't change it.
Why tell me?

23:01.080 --> 23:03.000
'Cause everything that's
gone wrong with my life

23:03.000 --> 23:04.460
is because of stupid sluts
like Heidi.

23:04.460 --> 23:06.670
I'm not saying that.
Then you're fired.

23:06.670 --> 23:09.250
Everyone already thinks
I'm some frat bro meathead.

23:09.250 --> 23:10.250
Why do you think
we're asking you?

23:10.250 --> 23:11.620
We're not asking.
We're telling.

23:11.620 --> 23:13.880
Or maybe you're okay
with letting the Nazis win?

23:13.880 --> 23:15.580
Life was better
before dating apps.

23:15.580 --> 23:17.500
Men -- we used to
ask women out.

23:17.500 --> 23:19.040
We would tell them what to do,
how to dress.

23:19.040 --> 23:20.620
Now women think
they have all the power,

23:20.620 --> 23:22.040
that they can say no.

23:22.040 --> 23:23.330
That's Heidi's fault.

23:23.330 --> 23:25.420
We don't actually
talk like that.

23:27.920 --> 23:30.750
Here's how
you win your case.

23:30.750 --> 23:31.750
What's that?

23:31.750 --> 23:33.540
Heidi's passwords.

23:33.540 --> 23:36.460
There's no way in hell
I'm giving you my passwords.

23:36.460 --> 23:37.620
What, your privacy
is more important to you

23:37.620 --> 23:39.420
than a $50 million
government contract?

23:39.420 --> 23:41.420
In what world do we give
my number-one enemy

23:41.420 --> 23:43.040
access to things
that could destroy me?

23:43.040 --> 23:44.620
Robert: It's Carl's lawsuit
that'll destroy you,

23:44.620 --> 23:46.460
not some salacious video
or photo.

23:47.790 --> 23:49.380
Carl: How do you know
there's anything to find?

23:49.380 --> 23:51.380
Come on, Carlito.
She's a whore.

23:51.380 --> 23:53.670
I knew from the second
I saw her.

23:55.880 --> 23:58.040
Has Ms. Turpin decided
to meet my client's demands?

23:58.040 --> 24:00.920
Or are we going to trial?
Trial.

24:00.920 --> 24:02.920
Just not
the one you think.

24:02.920 --> 24:04.790
Your client posted this
on Reddit a few hours ago.

24:04.790 --> 24:07.500
Heidi: This is your chance
to put me to work.

24:07.500 --> 24:09.920
Just say the word,
and I'll do it.
Oh, my God, is that --

24:09.920 --> 24:12.920
Yours truly.
I look good, right?
You're the boss.

24:12.920 --> 24:15.330
Tegan: Carl, are you aware
that uploading sex tapes

24:15.330 --> 24:16.920
onto the Internet
without consent

24:16.920 --> 24:18.290
constitutes
sexual assault?

24:18.290 --> 24:19.920
Carl:
I didn't upload that.

24:19.920 --> 24:21.710
But I thank whoever did.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.830
This won't look good
to your board, huh?
I don't know.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.500
Kim K.
wasn't hurt by hers.

24:25.500 --> 24:27.290
Annalise, didn't you say
our I.T. expert

24:27.290 --> 24:30.040
pinged that upload
to Carl's I.P. address?
I did.

24:30.040 --> 24:31.710
Then I was hacked.

24:31.710 --> 24:33.290
Just like you hacked
our client's personal accounts?

24:33.290 --> 24:35.960
Something I'm sure
a search warrant will find out.

24:35.960 --> 24:37.960
Tegan: And then comes
our lawsuit against you --

24:37.960 --> 24:40.120
for defamation,
harassment, sextortion,

24:40.120 --> 24:41.670
and conspiracy.

24:41.670 --> 24:42.790
Ooh, that's a lot
of jail time.

24:42.790 --> 24:44.620
What -- What is that,
like, 10 years?

24:44.620 --> 24:46.170
Annalise: I bet that $5 million
you turned down

24:46.170 --> 24:48.000
looks real good
right about now.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.500
You set me up.
I'll prove it.

24:50.500 --> 24:52.210
Zeke: Carl, sometimes
there comes a point

24:52.210 --> 24:54.460
to throw in the towel.
I disagree.

24:54.460 --> 24:57.670
I'll die before surrendering
to a room full of women.

25:03.710 --> 25:06.880
Norris: We looked at
Ms. Price's divorce papers,

25:06.880 --> 25:08.460
as you suggested,

25:08.460 --> 25:10.460
and something in her financials
caught our eye.

25:10.460 --> 25:12.620
Ms. Price owns stock
worth a half a millions dollars

25:12.620 --> 25:14.210
in a company called
Barrington Holdings.

25:14.210 --> 25:15.330
And?

25:15.330 --> 25:16.710
Guess who owns it.

25:18.750 --> 25:23.540
Laurel Castillo.
This is it -- our proof.

25:23.540 --> 25:25.670
Of what?

25:25.670 --> 25:28.250
Tegan owns stock
in a company Laurel owns.

25:28.250 --> 25:30.500
Or it's just in her name.

25:30.500 --> 25:33.080
Or Tegan is the one
who helped Laurel disappear

25:33.080 --> 25:35.420
and the stock
is how Laurel paid her.

25:47.710 --> 25:49.620
What's your endgame?

25:49.620 --> 25:52.040
President of the incels?

25:52.040 --> 25:54.330
I just want
the matches I deserve.
Oh.

25:54.330 --> 25:56.670
You know what?
That's your problem --

25:56.670 --> 25:58.540
"deserve."

25:58.540 --> 26:00.960
Only thing you deserve
is a kick in the ass.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.620
You dump your pain on women
as if it's your birthright

26:03.620 --> 26:05.670
'cause you don't think
anyone understands

26:05.670 --> 26:07.080
what you're going through.

26:07.080 --> 26:08.670
Everybody's
going through something.

26:08.670 --> 26:10.670
People stare at you
in the supermarket?

26:10.670 --> 26:14.750
Ask how sex works for you?
Reject you?

26:14.750 --> 26:16.920
I'm a dark-skinned
black woman.

26:16.920 --> 26:21.210
Rejection has been my theme song
my entire life.

26:21.210 --> 26:25.620
Intimidating, unwanted,
undesirable.

26:25.620 --> 26:28.620
There are men that don't find me
sexual or attractive.

26:28.620 --> 26:32.210
They see me as a threat.
And I've hated them for it.

26:32.210 --> 26:35.080
But that hate has poisoned me,
not them.

26:35.080 --> 26:40.250
I know you're looking
for a woman to love.

26:40.250 --> 26:42.540
Why don't you start
loving yourself?

26:49.000 --> 26:50.830
Carl dropped the suit.

26:50.830 --> 26:53.830
And he's agreed to a permanent
injunction stipulation.

26:53.830 --> 26:55.000
How'd you do get him
to agree?

26:55.000 --> 26:56.710
Trade secret.

26:56.710 --> 26:58.920
You're welcome.

26:58.920 --> 27:01.710
Yes. Thank you
so much.

27:01.710 --> 27:05.670
All of you are amazing,
a real dream team.

27:05.670 --> 27:07.580
You don't agree with me,
I know, but --

27:07.580 --> 27:10.000
Wrong. I don't like you.
Annalise.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.830
You're perpetuating racism,
sexism, homophobia, you name it.

27:12.830 --> 27:14.170
And you're handing it

27:14.170 --> 27:16.290
to a dangerously flawed
government for coin,

27:16.290 --> 27:19.880
selling out the potential of so
many brilliant people to come.

27:19.880 --> 27:21.880
That's not worth
all the money in the world.

27:21.880 --> 27:22.880
Heidi:
You're condemning me?

27:22.880 --> 27:24.330
Didn't you get famous

27:24.330 --> 27:26.460
getting rapists and killers
out of jail?

27:26.460 --> 27:27.580
Yeah.

27:27.580 --> 27:30.170
And I'm probably
going straight to hell.

27:30.170 --> 27:32.580
I'll see you there,
Heidi.

27:34.960 --> 27:36.420
Robert: Annalise!

27:36.420 --> 27:38.620
Annalise!

27:38.620 --> 27:40.040
Great job in there

27:40.040 --> 27:44.420
with the takedown of
Mr. Hatemonger and my boss.

27:44.420 --> 27:47.210
I haven't enjoyed
a double feature like that

27:47.210 --> 27:50.000
since the Jimmy Stewart
retrospective at the Algonquin.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.500
Robert, are you hitting on me?
Hmm?

27:51.500 --> 27:53.290
Maybe you're gay
or just nice,

27:53.290 --> 27:55.540
but people think
that you're hitting on me.

27:55.540 --> 27:59.710
Well, which answer convinces you
to have a drink with me?

27:59.710 --> 28:01.380
I don't drink.

28:01.380 --> 28:02.790
Oh.
How about dinner then?

28:02.790 --> 28:04.580
I already ate.
Dessert?

28:04.580 --> 28:06.170
You know what?

28:06.170 --> 28:08.540
I have a lot on my plate.
Dating isn't a good idea.

28:08.540 --> 28:11.710
Ah.

28:22.500 --> 28:25.000
I like ice cream.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.540
-Stop cooking.
-Why?

28:26.540 --> 28:29.750
Ravi wants to come over tonight.
Dinner's canceled.

28:29.750 --> 28:31.040
You two aren't actually going
through with this, are you?

28:31.040 --> 28:32.460
Uh, yeah, we are.
I think?

28:32.460 --> 28:34.540
Yeah. It was my idea.
I just need to manscape.

28:34.540 --> 28:36.210
I'll help.
Asher: What about me?

28:36.210 --> 28:38.170
My balls
aren't that hairy.

28:38.170 --> 28:40.960
No. I mean
why does no one want me?

28:40.960 --> 28:42.460
Girls say
they want a nice guy,

28:42.460 --> 28:45.080
and -- and I -- I think I am,
or at least I try to be,

28:45.080 --> 28:47.080
but what's the point
of being nice

28:47.080 --> 28:48.460
if they don't even
want me?

28:51.080 --> 28:54.080
Unless the point of
how much respect I give a woman

28:54.080 --> 28:56.670
should not be about
getting laid.

28:56.670 --> 28:58.080
God, am I a baby incel?

28:58.080 --> 29:00.500
No, of course not.
You're overreacting.

29:00.500 --> 29:02.750
Michaela is dating literally
the last person on Earth
that she should be dating.

29:02.750 --> 29:04.920
Michaela has terrible taste.
Well, I don't.

29:04.920 --> 29:07.920
And...I want someone...

29:07.920 --> 29:09.750
and not just a super-model,

29:09.750 --> 29:12.330
but someone who's friendly
and funny and --

29:15.170 --> 29:16.080
Oh,
I take that all back.

29:16.080 --> 29:17.380
What?
Why?

29:17.380 --> 29:20.170
Lacey, who happens to be
a super-model,

29:20.170 --> 29:21.710
wants to hang out
at my place tonight.

29:21.710 --> 29:23.960
Looks like you two
are not the only ones
getting lucky tonight.

29:23.960 --> 29:27.920
Daddy is back in action!
Yeehaw!

29:30.250 --> 29:32.420
Here's the research
on the CDA,

29:32.420 --> 29:34.420
starting with Title V
from 1996.

29:35.830 --> 29:37.830
Did I screw up?

29:37.830 --> 29:40.420
No. I did, by forgetting
I asked you to do all this.

29:40.420 --> 29:44.040
The case is over. We won.
I'm sorry.

29:51.710 --> 29:52.710
I'll go.

29:52.710 --> 29:55.040
No.

29:55.040 --> 29:57.880
I'm too tired for that
tonight.

29:57.880 --> 29:59.290
You settling in?

29:59.290 --> 30:01.040
Let me know if anyone
messes with you.

30:01.040 --> 30:03.290
I read
your divorce papers.

30:03.290 --> 30:05.210
When I was getting Heidi's file,
I saw them on your desk.

30:05.210 --> 30:06.880
You're fired.
You shouldn't sign them.

30:06.880 --> 30:09.290
Okay, you --
Is your brain okay?

30:09.290 --> 30:10.290
Listen --
We are not friends.

30:10.290 --> 30:12.330
You do not get
to read my diary.

30:12.330 --> 30:13.960
I don't care about
your personal life.

30:13.960 --> 30:15.540
I care about
being a good lawyer,

30:15.540 --> 30:17.540
and I would be a bad lawyer
if I didn't tell you

30:17.540 --> 30:18.880
I think you're getting screwed
on this deal.

30:20.460 --> 30:22.290
Why shouldn't I sign?

30:22.290 --> 30:24.000
The Barrington stock --

30:24.000 --> 30:26.670
it's made money
since you and Cora split.

30:26.670 --> 30:28.290
Doubled.

30:28.290 --> 30:30.500
And since Cora left you,
there's no way

30:30.500 --> 30:32.880
she should be getting
half of those new dividends.

30:32.880 --> 30:34.080
She can have it all.

30:34.080 --> 30:35.710
It's worth $500,000.

30:35.710 --> 30:38.290
It's blood money
from the Castillos.

30:38.290 --> 30:40.920
Jorge gifted me
that stock years ago,

30:40.920 --> 30:44.290
back when I worked
at C&G in Mexico, and...

30:45.620 --> 30:48.210
...I regret what I did
to get it.

30:50.420 --> 30:53.040
However,
I won't regret killing you

30:53.040 --> 30:55.420
if you ever
go through my stuff again.

30:55.420 --> 30:58.460
I'm sorry.

30:58.460 --> 31:00.290
It won't happen again.

31:00.290 --> 31:04.540
Young Annalise: Sleeping with
a man is easy. Or a woman.

31:04.540 --> 31:06.540
Sex isn't complicated.

31:06.540 --> 31:07.710
Young Sam:
Most patients I see

31:07.710 --> 31:09.540
think sex
is extremely complicated.

31:09.540 --> 31:11.880
I think the part where you
have to talk to each other

31:11.880 --> 31:13.040
is more complicated.

31:14.250 --> 31:16.420
We've got an in!

31:16.420 --> 31:18.420
He just sat down to dinner
with a new lady friend,

31:18.420 --> 31:20.580
so that should give us enough
time to break into his room.

31:20.580 --> 31:22.420
It's 921.
Wait. What?

31:22.420 --> 31:24.580
You just have to go
to the front desk and
say that you're him.

31:24.580 --> 31:26.000
You realize that
I could get arrested.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Well,
only if you screw up.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.170
Look, just go talk to him.
Tell him who you are.

31:32.420 --> 31:34.960
Why did you come here
if you didn't want to help me?

31:34.960 --> 31:36.380
I want to help you,

31:36.380 --> 31:37.460
but you don't even
want to hear his side.

31:37.460 --> 31:39.920
He abandoned me.
That's his side.

31:39.920 --> 31:42.120
Well, at least
he's still alive.

31:42.120 --> 31:43.290
Meanwhile,
I'm here eavesdropping

31:43.290 --> 31:44.330
on Annalise's sex life

31:44.330 --> 31:46.170
to learn something
about my father,

31:46.170 --> 31:48.790
when you could literally
go talk to your dad right now.

31:48.790 --> 31:50.420
Instead, you're fixated
on destroying him.

31:50.420 --> 31:53.000
He deserves to be destroyed.
Alright.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.670
Well, your anger isn't
letting you hear me right now.

31:54.670 --> 31:55.960
Nice line.

31:55.960 --> 31:58.170
Did you pick that up from
Sam's creepy-therapist bit?

31:58.170 --> 31:59.920
I'm trying to level with you.
You mean control me.

31:59.920 --> 32:02.040
Protect you...

32:02.040 --> 32:03.210
...so you don't go breaking
into a man's hotel room

32:03.210 --> 32:04.830
to steal his DNA.

32:04.830 --> 32:06.880
Asher would do it
for me.

32:10.670 --> 32:12.920
You know,

32:12.920 --> 32:16.040
maybe this is why
people leave you --

32:16.040 --> 32:19.880
because you won't listen
to anyone but yourself.

32:19.880 --> 32:21.960
Get out.
See?

32:21.960 --> 32:23.960
We can't even
have a fight.

32:23.960 --> 32:26.000
Gabriel,
if you can't support me

32:26.000 --> 32:28.250
on my journey
to find peace and closure

32:28.250 --> 32:30.880
the way
I have decided to,

32:30.880 --> 32:32.670
then I don't
want you here.

32:32.670 --> 32:35.460
Please leave.

32:35.460 --> 32:38.420
Now!

32:49.920 --> 32:51.580
Woman: Turn-down service!

32:51.580 --> 32:53.210
Oh, hi. Sorry.

32:53.210 --> 32:55.000
I came to change
before dinner.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.790
Uh, can you come back?
Of course.

32:56.790 --> 32:58.830
Appreciate it.

33:55.750 --> 33:58.750
Solomon: Hey.

33:58.750 --> 34:03.620
I-I must've entered
the wrong room, uh...

34:08.460 --> 34:11.460
I know you, Michaela.

34:31.580 --> 34:33.040
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

34:33.040 --> 34:34.830
-Mm.

34:34.830 --> 34:36.080
-Ahh.
-Oh, that's good.

34:36.080 --> 34:39.040
Oliver: Okay, so, um, should
we set some ground rules

34:39.040 --> 34:40.580
or, um, talk about
the process or --

34:40.580 --> 34:43.000
I love that.
What are your guys' rules?

34:43.000 --> 34:44.500
Whatever you want.

34:44.500 --> 34:46.080
No, not whatever you want.
Don't worry.

34:46.080 --> 34:47.580
I'm pretty standard
when it comes to the kinks.

34:47.580 --> 34:50.210
I just hope kissing
isn't off the menu.

34:50.210 --> 34:51.580
I like kissing.
Should we kiss?

34:51.580 --> 34:53.170
Right now?
Um...

34:53.170 --> 34:55.170
Do you want me
to go first?

34:55.170 --> 34:57.210
Um, no.

34:57.210 --> 34:59.580
Uh -- Or maybe.
I just -- I-I don't know.

34:59.580 --> 35:01.040
Somebody just
do something.

35:11.830 --> 35:13.580
What?

35:13.580 --> 35:16.920
Uh, I-I-I just thought
that this would be harder.

35:18.080 --> 35:20.170
Harder like this?

35:20.170 --> 35:23.290
And off we go.

35:52.790 --> 35:55.170
Your most embarrassing
secret.

35:55.170 --> 35:56.380
You go first. Go.

35:56.380 --> 35:58.500
Never gonna happen.
Okay.

35:58.500 --> 36:00.790
I will settle for your
second most embarrassing secret,

36:00.790 --> 36:04.420
but that is
my final offer.

36:04.420 --> 36:06.210
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What just happened?

36:06.210 --> 36:08.170
Where'd you go?

36:08.170 --> 36:11.790
Just say it.

36:11.790 --> 36:14.710
Tell me you don't work
for the FBI.
Wow.

36:14.710 --> 36:16.250
You don't really think that
that's the only way

36:16.250 --> 36:17.620
anyone would
want to date you.

36:17.620 --> 36:20.210
It takes one Google search
to find all the reasons

36:20.210 --> 36:22.330
why someone wouldn't
want to date me.

36:22.330 --> 36:24.710
Pretty quick Google search,
yeah.

36:24.710 --> 36:26.750
So why are you here?

36:26.750 --> 36:29.120
'Cause I want to be.
Mm.

36:29.120 --> 36:30.790
I like your mind.

36:35.750 --> 36:38.170
I'm an alcoholic.

36:38.170 --> 36:39.790
A bad one.

36:41.830 --> 36:43.620
My second most
embarrassing secret.

36:43.620 --> 36:46.210
Oh.
Right.

36:46.210 --> 36:47.580
I have bad credit.

36:47.580 --> 36:50.380
That's not
embarrassing enough.

36:50.380 --> 36:51.540
Oh, no?
Mnh.

36:51.540 --> 36:53.710
Why don't you try
being a single man my age,

36:53.710 --> 36:55.580
a lawyer no less,

36:55.580 --> 36:58.710
and having to come out
to potential romantic partners

36:58.710 --> 36:59.960
as broke.

36:59.960 --> 37:01.880
Try that.
Mm.

37:01.880 --> 37:06.000
Well, you know, everyone thinks
that I killed my husband.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.830
Yeah.
You didn't, I hope?

37:10.830 --> 37:12.830
No.
But no one believes me.

37:12.830 --> 37:16.210
They all think I'm mean,
selfish, a bully.

37:16.210 --> 37:18.250
'Cause I am.
I got anger issues.

37:18.250 --> 37:20.620
Yeah. I'm getting that.

37:20.620 --> 37:23.830
And that's just the surface,
topsoil,

37:23.830 --> 37:29.500
'cause underneath
all this...it's messy.

37:29.500 --> 37:34.460
I'm messy...broken.

37:34.460 --> 37:36.120
We all are.

37:37.460 --> 37:39.210
Doesn't mean
I don't want to know you.

37:40.380 --> 37:42.750
Look, Annalise,
I'm not here to fix you.

37:42.750 --> 37:45.580
I'm too old for that...

37:45.580 --> 37:48.000
and for this
whole chase thing

37:48.000 --> 37:50.580
that you clearly
want me to do.

37:50.580 --> 37:53.460
I'll pursue you.
I'll pursue you all day.

37:53.460 --> 37:55.830
Hell, I'll --
I'll even eat this ice cream,

37:55.830 --> 37:58.420
despite the fact
that I'm lactose intolerant.

37:58.420 --> 38:01.710
But I won't chase.

38:04.790 --> 38:07.920
I hope that's enough.

38:07.920 --> 38:12.120
Young Annalise: It's over.
I broke up with Eve.

38:12.120 --> 38:13.960
Young Sam: Really?

38:13.960 --> 38:15.540
Why are you acting
surprised?

38:15.540 --> 38:17.540
Because I am.

38:17.540 --> 38:18.960
Last time you were here,

38:18.960 --> 38:21.540
things were going well
with Eve.

38:21.540 --> 38:23.920

According to Tegan.

40:44.210 --> 40:46.420
Why would she tell me

I met someone else.

Who is it?
A man.

41:35.920 --> 41:39.120
He's kind, caring,
handsome.

41:39.120 --> 41:41.670
Problem is,
he's my therapist.

41:41.670 --> 41:44.460
Who told you
Laurel owns that company?

41:47.250 --> 41:48.420
The FBI?

41:50.670 --> 41:52.580
Are you working
with them?

41:52.580 --> 41:54.330
No.

41:54.330 --> 41:57.460
Do not lie to me
right now.
