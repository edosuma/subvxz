WEBVTT

00:10.719 --> 00:16.725
Two, four, six, eight!
We don't wanna radiate!

00:16.725 --> 00:18.727
Stay back! Stay back!

00:29.613 --> 00:31.823
Hey, hi. I got stung.

00:32.616 --> 00:33.617
Have a seat.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.466
On such things do revolutions founder.

00:50.843 --> 00:52.177
Are you taking the piss?

00:52.678 --> 00:53.679
Yeah, a bit.

00:54.263 --> 00:56.390
Hardly Joan of Arc stuff, is it?

00:56.390 --> 00:58.392
Yeah, well, it really hurt, all right?

00:59.268 --> 01:02.604
I suppose you think they should just
kick all of our heads in, hey?

01:02.604 --> 01:04.940
Never mind our right
to peacefully protest.

01:04.940 --> 01:06.441
What, you think I'm with them?

01:07.359 --> 01:11.405
I'm a student here.
It's just my weekend gig to pay the rent.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.573
You go here?

01:13.574 --> 01:14.825
Philosophy undergrad.

01:15.325 --> 01:17.286
May not change the world,
but I'll think about it.

01:19.288 --> 01:22.708
So, what? Are you, like, a mature student?
I mean, how old are you anyway?

01:23.625 --> 01:26.211
Takes some of us a little longer
to get to where we need to be.

01:26.211 --> 01:27.963
Are you with me?

01:50.110 --> 01:51.445
Shouldn't you be out there?

01:55.157 --> 01:56.992
What's your name?
-Gemma.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.828
Nice to meet you, Gemma. I'm Dale.

02:04.750 --> 02:05.834
So, Dale...

02:07.085 --> 02:09.378
bet you've got a lot of fun drugs in here.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.008
I can get you some aspirin if you want.

02:13.675 --> 02:14.676
Boring.

02:16.178 --> 02:17.638
You always this boring, Dale?

02:19.723 --> 02:22.309
If you're gonna be rude, I might have
to throw you out of my ambulance.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.279
I'm staying right here with you.

02:43.747 --> 02:44.915
You're okay.

02:46.083 --> 02:47.543
What are you doing here?

02:48.836 --> 02:51.088
I just wanted
to see you one last time, baby.

02:51.964 --> 02:53.257
I owe you that.

02:53.257 --> 02:54.633
One last time?

02:56.593 --> 02:58.554
They sentenced you to 19 years, Dale.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.811
I did it so we could go to India.

03:05.811 --> 03:09.189
Baby, I don't want you to worry about me.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.774
I got clean.

03:10.774 --> 03:13.068
Dad paid for a clinic.

03:14.069 --> 03:15.320
I'm gonna be all right.

03:27.666 --> 03:29.042
You're gonna be all right?

05:13.272 --> 05:15.858
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

05:15.858 --> 05:17.651
Hey, hey. Take it easy.

05:19.570 --> 05:21.530
No, no. You can't be here.

05:21.530 --> 05:23.490
Just lay down.
-I have cholera.

05:23.490 --> 05:24.908
It's not safe.

05:25.534 --> 05:26.869
It's okay.

05:35.377 --> 05:36.837
Who's Gemma, by the way?

05:46.013 --> 05:47.264
What are you doing here?

05:48.807 --> 05:52.186
Maybe you're not the only one
who needs a salvation ride.

05:55.272 --> 05:56.648
Can you have some of that?

06:17.294 --> 06:19.338
Stand back against the wall.

06:59.336 --> 07:00.921
You-- You cover that side!

07:03.006 --> 07:05.133
You-- You with me. Find her!

07:08.178 --> 07:09.263
Go! Go!

07:12.808 --> 07:14.101
Down here!

07:29.616 --> 07:30.659
She's here.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.288
Take her back.

07:35.330 --> 07:38.584
Leave me. Leave me.

07:40.711 --> 07:42.796
Leave me.

07:54.266 --> 07:58.645
Please tell your parents
to sell this goddamn sixth-floor flat

08:00.397 --> 08:04.568
and buy a new one of a nice new building

08:06.236 --> 08:07.362
with a lift.

08:08.197 --> 08:09.823
Please take these inside.

08:12.409 --> 08:13.869
What is all this?

08:15.037 --> 08:16.079
Red notices.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.753
You know, if Lin is a fugitive,
we will find him here in these files.

08:22.753 --> 08:25.506
Officer Mishra here
is one of the conditions I had to agree to

08:25.506 --> 08:28.967
since CBI property
is technically not allowed off-site.

08:28.967 --> 08:33.304
So your apartment is now
a temporary CBI facility

08:33.804 --> 08:35.390
with a staff of exactly one.

08:35.390 --> 08:37.058
Any other conditions I should know?

08:37.768 --> 08:40.187
Oh, <i>haan</i>, also promised my uncle
we'd give him the lead

08:40.187 --> 08:42.856
if Lin's involved in something serious.

08:42.856 --> 08:46.318
If he's in here,
then it is something serious.

08:57.788 --> 08:59.540
I feel so much better.

09:03.001 --> 09:04.002
Did you undress me?

09:04.670 --> 09:06.672
I couldn't let you lie in your own mess.

09:07.798 --> 09:09.299
Why? Self-conscious?

09:10.300 --> 09:12.094
Only that I shit myself.

09:13.428 --> 09:16.557
Not exactly how I pictured you seeing me
for the first time, you know?

09:16.557 --> 09:18.016
You pictured that, huh?

09:23.313 --> 09:25.649
You're not a good person,
picking on a dying man.

09:25.649 --> 09:28.861
You're not dying.
And I never said I was a good person.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.154
Eat.

09:39.204 --> 09:40.205
Good.

09:43.959 --> 09:45.961
What did you mean before, about salvation?

09:47.504 --> 09:48.505
What?

09:51.008 --> 09:54.303
You said I wasn't the only one
who needed a salvation ride.

09:55.179 --> 09:58.432
It's not nothing, you coming here.
Risking this.

09:59.725 --> 10:01.894
I think it's 'cause you feel guilty.

10:01.894 --> 10:03.562
So what am I guilty for?

10:03.562 --> 10:06.023
Madame Zhou. The stuff at the Palace.

10:08.192 --> 10:09.610
I mean, Zhou came after me,

10:09.610 --> 10:12.613
so technically it's your fault
that I got robbed

10:12.613 --> 10:17.367
and ended up here catching cholera,
almost dying.

10:18.327 --> 10:19.661
Everything's my fault.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.123
I'm joking.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.834
Doesn't mean you're not right.

10:25.834 --> 10:30.589
I did know the risk.
I just didn't know you. Not then.

10:31.965 --> 10:32.966
So I used you.

10:33.842 --> 10:37.221
When we were there, Zhou mentioned Ahmed,
the guy whose suit I was wearing.

10:38.764 --> 10:41.725
What happened there? Were you and he...
-No, no. God, no.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.478
We were friends.

10:45.020 --> 10:48.732
Ahmed was in love
with one of Zhou's girls, Christina.

10:49.733 --> 10:53.570
Forced Zhou to let her go,
but Zhou couldn't let that stand.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.364
And then she sent her guys after him?

10:56.281 --> 10:57.491
After Christina.

10:59.368 --> 11:01.620
Someone threw a jar of acid in her face.

11:02.412 --> 11:03.914
Ahmed wanted revenge.

11:04.498 --> 11:07.334
I thought I talked him down,
but I was wrong.

11:08.585 --> 11:11.171
Body turned up a few days later.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.215
Zhou killed him, not you.

11:13.215 --> 11:14.383
Yeah.

11:16.218 --> 11:19.847
Ahmed loved Christina.
And I never trusted her.

11:20.514 --> 11:22.349
I thought she was just using him.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.060
But he didn't wanna listen.

11:25.060 --> 11:29.147
And then Christina got approached
about working at the Palace.

11:29.147 --> 11:31.942
She knew I worked with Zhou,
so she came to me.

11:32.901 --> 11:35.195
And I told her it was all gonna be okay.

11:36.405 --> 11:38.156
I wanted her gone.

11:39.825 --> 11:41.577
You can't blame yourself for that.

11:41.577 --> 11:44.413
Someone came after you,
and that started the fire.

11:45.414 --> 11:47.958
You told me that little boy's mom was dead
because of you.

11:49.001 --> 11:50.919
How is that your fault, not theirs?

11:53.046 --> 11:55.465
Ahmed is dead because of me.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.660
Was Sunita here?

12:24.912 --> 12:28.874
I know the face of every man
who comes into my house.

12:30.125 --> 12:32.044
I have not seen you here before.

12:32.044 --> 12:33.378
I can pay you some money.

12:41.011 --> 12:45.599
I did have a girl named Sunita,
but she left the house a few days ago.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.559
That's not enough.

12:50.646 --> 12:53.106
It would be better if I didn't
commit your face to memory, yes?

13:02.533 --> 13:04.660
I'm gonna have to leave town.

13:07.204 --> 13:08.580
Kavita's been poking around me

13:08.580 --> 13:11.250
since I got drunk
and ran my mouth at Reynaldo's.

13:13.377 --> 13:15.045
She wants to do a story about me.

13:15.796 --> 13:18.715
I could try and talk to her.
Convince her to stop.

13:19.633 --> 13:23.554
Would you listen if you were her?
Or just get more excited?

13:25.430 --> 13:26.765
I don't have a choice.

13:28.058 --> 13:31.270
They find me,
I'm going back to jail, or worse.

13:34.439 --> 13:36.191
But I don't wanna leave because...

13:37.693 --> 13:39.111
'Cause I'm in love with you.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.704
I told you how I feel about that.

13:48.704 --> 13:51.164
Yeah, and I call bullshit.

13:52.833 --> 13:56.336
Look, I'm not asking you to say it back,
and you can call it whatever you want,

13:56.336 --> 14:00.132
but you can't deny how you feel--
-I do like you, Lin.

14:01.049 --> 14:03.677
I could get
head over heels in like with you.

14:07.222 --> 14:09.641
That's probably another reason
why you should leave.

14:14.271 --> 14:15.480
We need clean water.

15:51.076 --> 15:54.371
Go. You have permission
to court my daughter.

16:15.225 --> 16:16.518
What time is it?

16:23.942 --> 16:25.402
Karla?

16:41.919 --> 16:45.339
Look, look. Linbaba is okay now.

16:59.061 --> 17:02.314
<i>Arre</i>, Linbaba!

17:08.278 --> 17:11.198
Three whole days
since I have seen your face.

17:11.198 --> 17:15.117
I am too happy you are alive.
What a lucky morning, <i>yaar</i>!

17:15.117 --> 17:16.703
I have such good news, huh?

17:16.703 --> 17:19.205
Just now, I was giving help
at Kumar's chai shop,

17:19.205 --> 17:22.542
and they are telling me
I can court Parvati, boss!

17:22.542 --> 17:25.212
That's great. Listen, Prabhu.
-None of this would be possible without--

17:25.212 --> 17:26.964
Yes?
-I need to shit.

17:26.964 --> 17:28.966
If I go, are they all gonna follow me?

17:29.758 --> 17:32.344
I will deal with this for you.

17:32.344 --> 17:36.723
Listen! Linbaba wants to go shit.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.226
By himself!

17:41.854 --> 17:43.981
Thanks, mate.
-Welcome.

17:48.527 --> 17:51.113
Come, come. So you slept okay?

17:52.155 --> 17:53.156
Yeah.

17:53.156 --> 17:55.993
Yeah? Where is Karla Ma'am?

17:55.993 --> 17:57.077
Good question.

18:11.091 --> 18:12.509
200,000.

18:16.972 --> 18:18.015
It's all there.

18:21.268 --> 18:22.394
That Lisa,

18:23.312 --> 18:24.605
she's something, hey?

18:30.444 --> 18:32.321
Her and I nearly broke the damn bed.

18:33.322 --> 18:35.365
Shit nearly broke my damn dick.

18:38.368 --> 18:40.621
I thought maybe she was your woman,

18:40.621 --> 18:44.625
but no way you share
a piece like that, right?

18:47.586 --> 18:50.005
You're right. It's all here.

18:58.263 --> 19:00.098
Oh, come on. This is silly.
-<i>Arre</i>, don't worry.

19:00.098 --> 19:02.643
Go and do your business.
Do your business, <i>yaar.</i>

19:04.353 --> 19:07.147
Are you getting involved now too?
-I'm happy. That's why.

19:11.527 --> 19:13.904
He isn't who you think he is.

19:16.865 --> 19:17.991
Bastard!

19:19.576 --> 19:20.827
He is a murderer!

19:21.912 --> 19:23.080
What is this, Ravi?

19:23.080 --> 19:24.706
He killed my mother.

19:26.667 --> 19:29.086
We talked about this--
-He killed her.

19:29.086 --> 19:31.922
He tried
to save your mother's life, Ravi--

19:31.922 --> 19:33.590
He set the fire.

19:33.590 --> 19:38.387
I heard him and the <i>gora</i> woman.
He killed her!

19:39.847 --> 19:41.598
He started it!
-Listen to me.

19:42.558 --> 19:44.059
Whatever you think you heard--

19:44.059 --> 19:46.854
Look, Ravi,

19:47.396 --> 19:51.191
by telling this lie,
you are the one setting the fire.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.862
Lin was with me when the fire started.

19:55.612 --> 19:57.906
No, he was with me.

19:57.906 --> 19:59.825
He was with me.

20:01.410 --> 20:04.037
If I hear this from you again,

20:04.037 --> 20:09.418
I'll talk to Qasimbhai and tell him
you are spreading lies. Understand?

20:10.836 --> 20:12.838
Now go.

20:23.599 --> 20:24.975
Is that our money?

20:39.656 --> 20:41.867
Raheem said you two had quite a time.

20:43.994 --> 20:44.995
Was it worth it?

20:46.622 --> 20:48.498
Did you enjoy it, Lisa?

20:49.917 --> 20:50.918
Did I enjoy what?

20:52.544 --> 20:54.630
The hours he spent fucking me?

20:55.380 --> 20:57.966
No, look at me. You started this.

20:59.176 --> 21:02.346
That's our money because of me.
Because of what I let him do to me.

21:03.722 --> 21:04.848
I earned it.

21:05.516 --> 21:08.936
I did my part for us, and I can be proud
of that unless you make it dirty.

21:16.193 --> 21:17.486
Where are you going?

21:17.486 --> 21:18.654
You gotta be kidding me.

21:18.654 --> 21:21.156
You show up, start this bullshit,
and then run away?

21:21.156 --> 21:22.783
You wanted this. Come on. Let's have it!

21:24.535 --> 21:25.702
Sebastian--

22:01.196 --> 22:02.656
Fuck is he doing here?

22:03.657 --> 22:07.035
These are Walid Shah's men.
-What do they want, Linbaba?

22:08.078 --> 22:10.914
<i>Deep down, I knew this was on me.</i>

22:11.415 --> 22:15.043
<i>My deal with the devil had just come due.</i>
-Walidbhai sends a message.

22:15.043 --> 22:17.337
There will be no more deals
with Khader Khan.

22:17.337 --> 22:19.756
No more water for you.

22:20.424 --> 22:23.093
Your water... done.

22:47.451 --> 22:48.785
No, Linbaba, there are too many.

22:54.041 --> 22:56.460
You're still on the wrong side,
doctor man.

23:01.507 --> 23:03.091
Hey, what are you doing?

23:08.805 --> 23:11.225
We'll visit every day.

23:11.225 --> 23:13.060
Why are you doing this?

23:23.820 --> 23:25.364
Happy, Mr. Lin?

23:25.906 --> 23:28.575
See what happens
when you do deals with gangsters?

23:32.579 --> 23:36.083
We're in the middle of a war now.
And you brought this on us.

23:37.793 --> 23:39.419
This is all your fault.

23:59.565 --> 24:02.067
Did you tell Khader I've been with Lin?

24:02.734 --> 24:04.152
No.

24:04.152 --> 24:07.281
That doesn't mean someone won't.
He has many new friends in Sagar Wada.

24:07.865 --> 24:09.074
Because of Lin.

24:10.284 --> 24:12.119
So much for us all staying away.

24:12.119 --> 24:13.412
Yeah, Lin came to him.

24:16.623 --> 24:18.500
How is he? Lin?

24:18.500 --> 24:19.710
He'll be fine.

24:21.503 --> 24:22.504
How are you?

24:23.213 --> 24:24.298
I'll be fine too.

24:28.760 --> 24:32.222
I know you don't like this,
but it will be over soon.

24:58.790 --> 25:00.417
Sunita, yes?

25:02.419 --> 25:04.463
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting
so long.

25:05.088 --> 25:06.882
I know it hasn't been easy.

25:10.010 --> 25:11.803
Sorry, let me speak in Hindi.

25:14.932 --> 25:16.099
Are you Madame Zhou?

25:16.099 --> 25:19.853
No, but I asked for you
to be brought here.

25:19.853 --> 25:22.689
Padma bought your debt for me.

25:22.689 --> 25:24.107
Why?

25:24.107 --> 25:27.736
We have business, you and I.

25:27.736 --> 25:31.907
I don't know what you are talking about.

25:31.907 --> 25:35.160
Forget about that. I will get the money.

25:35.160 --> 25:37.663
I have friends, important friends--

25:37.663 --> 25:39.748
I want to talk about your friend.

25:42.167 --> 25:44.670
Your friend from Khandala.

25:45.420 --> 25:47.965
Do not say his name, Sunita.

25:48.799 --> 25:50.926
Do as I ask.

25:51.718 --> 25:53.846
Your debt will be paid.

25:55.180 --> 26:01.937
You'll be free to go
and do whatever you want.

26:01.937 --> 26:04.147
What do I have to do?

26:04.940 --> 26:06.692
I need you to call your friend.

26:07.317 --> 26:11.154
Tell him that everything is fine.
And invite him here for a visit.

26:12.281 --> 26:15.409
Just a phone call and you're free.

26:19.955 --> 26:20.956
No.

26:22.207 --> 26:26.795
I know he's been good to you,
but is whatever he's paying worth this?

26:27.921 --> 26:32.968
He's not paying, and I won't hurt him.

26:34.261 --> 26:37.097
Not for a bitch like you.

26:37.097 --> 26:41.018
I love him and he loves me. Understand?

26:43.228 --> 26:44.271
Out.

26:45.105 --> 26:46.106
Get out!

27:03.290 --> 27:04.333
All right.

27:06.126 --> 27:08.337
You're all set, Johnny.
-Thank you, Linbaba.

27:17.554 --> 27:19.056
Do you need something?

27:22.935 --> 27:26.021
Ravi told me you were the one
who started the fire.

27:29.566 --> 27:30.776
Pretty much.

27:45.791 --> 27:47.376
Friends do not keep secrets.

27:49.169 --> 27:50.295
Not about such things.

27:50.295 --> 27:54.007
How am I supposed to help you
if I do not know you are needing help?

27:55.300 --> 27:58.512
It's okay. I told Ravi
I was with you when the fire started.

28:01.306 --> 28:02.599
Why would you lie?

28:02.599 --> 28:04.268
It is in the past.

28:04.268 --> 28:06.144
Let the lie be the truth
if it makes things better.

28:06.144 --> 28:07.312
Like your medicine.

28:08.647 --> 28:12.943
I see it. You're doing so many good things
to make up for one bad.

28:14.403 --> 28:15.946
You know, you are leaving soon, <i>na</i>?

28:16.530 --> 28:19.825
If you took away the people's faith now,
how selfish would that be?

28:19.825 --> 28:21.618
I've been selfish the whole time.

28:23.495 --> 28:24.872
How can you say this?

28:24.872 --> 28:28.792
All the things you have done for us,
almost dying, bringing the water--

28:28.792 --> 28:30.919
It wasn't about you. It was about me.

28:32.045 --> 28:33.714
Qasim warned me about Khan,

28:33.714 --> 28:36.175
and I went anyway because I wanted
to make myself feel better.

28:37.926 --> 28:41.138
I wanted to pay my debt
so that I could leave.

28:41.722 --> 28:42.806
And if you hadn't...

28:45.058 --> 28:46.977
maybe my Parvati would be dead.

28:50.355 --> 28:52.274
You are a good man,
and you think too much.

29:07.956 --> 29:11.752
Whoever you're trying to manipulate,
this girl loves him.

29:12.920 --> 29:14.254
And she believes he loves her.

29:14.254 --> 29:15.714
You were listening.

29:16.673 --> 29:17.799
Of course.

29:25.349 --> 29:30.103
There is nothing more stupid or stubborn
than a whore in love.

29:31.146 --> 29:32.648
Are you speaking from experience?

29:36.068 --> 29:37.486
Is that hard to believe?

29:37.486 --> 29:39.905
There are so many stories about you.

29:39.905 --> 29:41.698
Who knows?
-Yeah.

29:42.866 --> 29:45.327
And I came up with most of them myself.

29:46.828 --> 29:50.290
But the best tales
always have a bit of truth.

29:51.875 --> 29:57.256
I'm sure you heard the one
where I was mistress to a KGB spymaster.

30:00.175 --> 30:01.260
They say...

30:04.638 --> 30:07.558
one day he left India, leaving me behind.

30:08.392 --> 30:11.812
The men who were after him
caught me instead.

30:12.813 --> 30:15.190
Used me to take out their frustrations.

30:16.650 --> 30:22.698
The only thing stronger than love
is the hate left behind when it's gone.

30:28.120 --> 30:31.456
Let the fear build.
Let this Sunita question her love.

30:33.166 --> 30:36.920
Take that love away,
and she will do anything you want.

30:39.089 --> 30:42.092
In the end, you will be doing her a favor.

30:44.386 --> 30:45.387
Are you happy?

30:48.599 --> 30:51.185
This place, what you've built,

30:52.436 --> 30:53.854
does it bring you any pleasure?

30:54.855 --> 30:58.734
It gives me power, control.

30:58.734 --> 31:00.527
And those make you happy?

31:03.405 --> 31:06.825
Happier than I was without them.

31:08.535 --> 31:10.621
You never wish
you'd taken a different path?

31:10.621 --> 31:11.997
To where?

31:12.706 --> 31:16.210
What is happily ever after
for a forsaken whore?

31:17.419 --> 31:19.588
Maybe we could ask your Sunita.

31:33.810 --> 31:35.145
I'm back.

31:40.567 --> 31:42.236
Do you want me to take this to Raheem?

31:42.236 --> 31:43.320
No.

31:45.197 --> 31:47.783
You know, I had a visit
from Abdullah Taheri the other night

31:47.783 --> 31:51.495
telling me to stop our dealing.
-The other-- And you didn't tell me?

31:51.495 --> 31:53.705
He could've been watching
when I went to Raheem for the money!

31:53.705 --> 31:56.583
Yeah, well, how did he know, huh?

31:57.417 --> 31:59.503
Who did you tell?
-No, no one.

32:00.128 --> 32:01.129
Fuck.

32:05.759 --> 32:07.511
What about Didier?
-Didier.

32:07.511 --> 32:10.055
Didier, he--
You asked him to send us clients.

32:10.055 --> 32:12.683
Didier keeps half the secrets in Colaba.
-Fuck.

32:14.518 --> 32:16.478
Who would want to fuck us this way?

32:24.069 --> 32:25.404
What about Lin?

32:27.281 --> 32:30.409
He's friends with Abdullah and Didier.

32:31.994 --> 32:33.412
And you two hate each other.

32:35.247 --> 32:37.374
You know, I saw them together
just the other day.

32:38.041 --> 32:39.877
He made some stupid remark,
<i>sacco di merda</i>.

32:39.877 --> 32:41.962
I should cut his fucking throat, that guy.

32:43.088 --> 32:44.089
Lin.

32:44.882 --> 32:47.176
You know, it-- Well, fuck Lin.

32:48.594 --> 32:49.595
Fuck Lin.

32:49.595 --> 32:54.850
Fuck Lin, fuck Khader Khan,
fuck Raheem, and fuck Zhou, huh?

32:56.894 --> 32:59.771
Modena, we keep this 200, okay?
We sell the drugs we have at a discount...

32:59.771 --> 33:00.856
No, no.

33:00.856 --> 33:03.901
...and get the fuck out of Bombay before
anybody knows we screwed them. Hey!

33:06.236 --> 33:08.155
Look, if you're out,
I'm gonna go by myself,

33:08.155 --> 33:10.240
but you get none of this.
-Oh, fuck. Fuck.

33:10.240 --> 33:11.867
Fuck, fuck.
-None of this.

33:12.618 --> 33:13.619
Look at me.

33:14.661 --> 33:16.496
All or nothing, Modena.

33:21.585 --> 33:24.213
Come on, Modena. Fuck them all.

33:25.047 --> 33:26.048
Okay.

33:26.757 --> 33:28.717
Okay, okay.
-Okay? <i>Sì</i>?

33:28.717 --> 33:30.135
Okay. Yeah.
-<i>Sì</i>?

33:31.470 --> 33:32.721
Okay.

33:32.721 --> 33:34.306
<i>Andiamo</i>. Let's go, huh?

33:34.306 --> 33:37.309
Walid Shah leads
one of the other companies.

33:37.309 --> 33:38.644
Companies?

33:39.228 --> 33:40.437
You mean gangs, right?

33:41.688 --> 33:43.607
Why does he care
about you giving away water?

33:43.607 --> 33:45.651
He knows I want to buy Sagar Wada.

33:46.235 --> 33:47.319
He wants it also.

33:48.237 --> 33:49.238
Lin.

33:50.322 --> 33:51.406
At least sit.

33:52.115 --> 33:53.367
Please.

34:03.377 --> 34:05.546
Drink something.
-No, thank you.

34:07.673 --> 34:09.466
Sagar Wada sits on a large tract

34:09.466 --> 34:12.261
of the most valuable real estate
in the world.

34:13.679 --> 34:17.683
Walid Shah has bought
the loyalty of the land minister,

34:17.683 --> 34:19.560
believing that he will still prevail.

34:20.310 --> 34:23.397
But there are many thousands
who live in Sagar Wada,

34:23.397 --> 34:26.358
and where there are people,
there is power.

34:27.525 --> 34:31.196
Walid owns the minister.
He does not want me controlling the votes.

34:31.196 --> 34:32.947
So you want them to do what?

34:34.283 --> 34:36.827
Vote for the destruction
of their own homes?

34:36.827 --> 34:41.123
It's a unique irony of our city

34:41.123 --> 34:44.376
that the poor have no say
in whether they are evicted,

34:44.376 --> 34:48.213
but they have a very great say
in who gets to evict them.

34:48.797 --> 34:51.592
Do you not think I understand
what I'm taking from them?

34:51.592 --> 34:52.676
How could you?

34:53.302 --> 34:58.015
My own home was stolen from me
when I was 15.

34:59.600 --> 35:01.977
That is not a pain that goes away.

35:03.061 --> 35:05.147
I have funded your clinic.

35:05.147 --> 35:07.274
Donated medicine, water.

35:07.816 --> 35:11.612
I want to help these people any way I can
while their homes still stand.

35:11.612 --> 35:13.655
But Sagar Wada will be sold.

35:14.198 --> 35:16.950
This is bullshit.
-This is Bombay.

35:16.950 --> 35:18.785
Why didn't you tell me before?

35:18.785 --> 35:20.954
Because you may not have accepted
the water.

35:31.798 --> 35:33.675
So now they're in a war.

35:33.675 --> 35:35.761
Will they fight?
-I don't fucking know.

35:37.262 --> 35:38.805
I'm done being the middleman, Khaderbhai.

35:38.805 --> 35:41.391
You want something from them,
you ask them yourself.

35:41.934 --> 35:42.935
Very well.

35:46.396 --> 35:47.397
Hey.

35:48.398 --> 35:50.400
Hey yourself.

35:52.861 --> 35:54.154
It's good to see you.

35:55.656 --> 35:56.657
You too.

35:59.159 --> 36:01.495
See, that's the thing.
No one really knows him.

36:01.495 --> 36:03.830
Maybe because he never speaks.

36:04.790 --> 36:07.084
He was the youngest of nine
and he grew up dirt poor,

36:07.084 --> 36:10.087
so no one ever really paid him
any attention, and that's how he got by.

36:11.713 --> 36:14.007
But when it's just the two of us,
he's different.

36:14.591 --> 36:15.717
He's funny, you know?

36:16.927 --> 36:18.053
And sweet.

36:21.723 --> 36:24.059
And he just wants me to be happy.

36:25.519 --> 36:27.187
But he's so weak.

36:31.316 --> 36:33.360
I know it doesn't seem like it,
but I did what you said

36:33.360 --> 36:35.821
and I took fucking responsibility
for myself and for him.

36:35.821 --> 36:38.824
And, yeah, I had to fuck
this Raheem guy, but so what?

36:40.200 --> 36:42.870
'Cause this morning,
when Modena walked in with the money,

36:44.621 --> 36:46.164
for the first time I felt...

36:47.833 --> 36:48.917
empowered, maybe.

36:51.545 --> 36:53.046
I probably sound crazy.

36:53.046 --> 36:56.466
Well, if you came to me looking
for life advice, then yeah, you're crazy.

36:59.928 --> 37:01.513
Whatever you decide to do...

37:03.557 --> 37:07.019
there's always a place here for you.

37:12.858 --> 37:15.485
But I think you should leave with Modena
while you can.

37:16.695 --> 37:21.950
Just take whatever you've got
and get out of Bombay.

38:51.456 --> 38:52.457
It's late.

38:53.375 --> 38:56.712
You can go if you'd like. I have Mishra.

38:58.839 --> 38:59.840
Or...

39:01.508 --> 39:03.468
at least I think I did.

39:09.099 --> 39:10.976
At least he took his shoes off, <i>na</i>?

39:33.081 --> 39:36.543
So what are you going to show me
that'll change our situation, huh?

39:36.543 --> 39:38.879
Machine guns that'll chase off
these goondas?

39:38.879 --> 39:42.257
You don't listen, you don't learn,
yet you want to make all the decisions.

39:42.257 --> 39:43.967
Nope. I'm done with that.

39:46.470 --> 39:47.638
That's why you're here.

39:57.814 --> 39:58.982
<i>Assalamu alaikum.</i>

39:58.982 --> 40:00.526
<i>Wa alaikumu assalam.</i>

40:01.318 --> 40:04.071
You honor me
with your presence, Qasimbhai.

40:05.656 --> 40:07.533
We both know the opposite is true.

40:08.325 --> 40:10.494
And that, I assume, was the point.

40:10.494 --> 40:13.622
I arranged for Khader to come
so he could make his case to you directly.

40:13.622 --> 40:15.582
Lin says you are a reasonable man.

40:15.582 --> 40:19.628
Despite what he thinks,
Mr. Lin knows very little about me.

40:20.879 --> 40:24.258
Or you, or anything much for that matter.

40:24.258 --> 40:27.219
He knows that loyalty cannot be bought.
It must be earned.

40:27.928 --> 40:30.138
A fact that I needed reminding of.

40:31.932 --> 40:33.642
I've come to discuss a path forward.

40:34.434 --> 40:39.273
And does your path forward
allow me to keep my home?

40:39.273 --> 40:40.357
No.

40:41.316 --> 40:42.317
Not in the end.

40:44.862 --> 40:46.738
At least we're being truthful about it.

40:47.823 --> 40:48.824
Please.

40:54.371 --> 40:56.832
This morning, a man came to me with this.

40:59.251 --> 41:00.627
He wanted me to give it to you.

41:01.461 --> 41:04.381
This gold, it's not real, but--

41:05.174 --> 41:07.843
but this ring has been in his family
for three generations.

41:09.052 --> 41:10.220
It has history.

41:11.763 --> 41:13.932
And that is not
something to be given up lightly.

41:14.892 --> 41:18.604
"If you had known the virtue of the ring,
half her worthiness that gave the ring,

41:18.604 --> 41:20.647
or your own honor to contain the ring,

41:20.647 --> 41:22.983
you would not then have parted
with the ring."

41:24.318 --> 41:26.403
I give the man a ring,
and he gives me a riddle.

41:27.863 --> 41:28.947
Look, forgive me--

41:28.947 --> 41:30.240
Thank you, Khaderbhai,

41:30.240 --> 41:33.410
for bringing up my lack of education.
-Qasim, no.

41:34.411 --> 41:36.079
I meant no disrespect.

41:36.955 --> 41:39.249
It is a quote from a play.

41:39.249 --> 41:42.711
I see your ring as a similar test.

41:44.713 --> 41:46.882
If I win the right to your land,

41:48.091 --> 41:50.052
it will be years
before development begins.

41:50.052 --> 41:52.804
I would like to help your community
in that time.

41:52.804 --> 41:56.391
At the beginning, the construction site
will need electricity,

41:56.391 --> 41:57.893
proper plumbing, and so on.

41:57.893 --> 42:01.146
You will have the benefits of these
until we break ground.

42:01.146 --> 42:04.691
I would also like to help find employment,
legitimate employment.

42:04.691 --> 42:06.318
If you take our homes from us,

42:06.318 --> 42:08.362
you must give us a chance
to grow beyond them.

42:08.362 --> 42:10.113
We are of the same mind.

42:10.113 --> 42:12.991
I have noticed some desks on my way here.

42:12.991 --> 42:17.204
I will build you a school,
pay for teachers, books.

42:17.955 --> 42:19.414
And after you break ground?

42:20.582 --> 42:21.875
What becomes of us then?

42:22.501 --> 42:25.671
I will help you find places to go,
<i>inshallah.</i>

42:31.301 --> 42:32.511
Give me back the ring.

42:33.637 --> 42:36.431
I will return it to the man
to give to his daughter.

42:37.558 --> 42:40.978
And for her children,
and for all those who follow.

42:45.148 --> 42:47.609
The person who wrote your play
is a wise man.

42:47.609 --> 42:50.946
I believe that all of the questions
and most of the answers to life

42:50.946 --> 42:52.364
are in Shakespeare.

42:55.325 --> 43:00.205
Tell me, Qasim, what is your answer?

43:14.011 --> 43:16.263
300,000 in there, huh?

43:16.263 --> 43:19.641
Enough to go
wherever the fuck we like, huh?

43:19.641 --> 43:20.726
I wanna take a piss.

43:20.726 --> 43:22.895
We're gonna leave tonight
before Raheem gets suspicious.

43:22.895 --> 43:24.229
I need to go get Lisa.

43:24.229 --> 43:26.940
Lisa, Lisa, Lisa. Fuck Lisa.

43:26.940 --> 43:28.400
She's not coming with us.

43:28.984 --> 43:31.028
She served her purpose, okay?

43:31.028 --> 43:33.322
And I'm not giving up
any of this money to a whore.

43:34.448 --> 43:38.243
You have to choose, Modena.
The cash and me, or her.

43:39.328 --> 43:40.579
And believe me, with this money,

43:40.579 --> 43:43.207
we're gonna find easy pussy
anywhere we're gonna go.

43:43.707 --> 43:45.792
You know, Lisa,
she's not so special, Modena.

43:46.793 --> 43:49.046
You know, we gonna find you
one a night every night

43:49.046 --> 43:50.547
in every city we're gonna visit.

43:52.716 --> 43:53.967
What do you think, Modena?

43:53.967 --> 43:57.971
Where do you wanna go?
<i>Italia?</i> Spain? South Am-merica...

44:09.525 --> 44:15.113
If you want me to beg,
you will wait a long time.

44:18.200 --> 44:21.828
I'm tired of begging.

44:23.038 --> 44:26.458
Sorry about what I said earlier.

44:27.376 --> 44:29.294
I shouldn't have made assumptions.

44:29.878 --> 44:32.881
The world has no place for me.

44:35.342 --> 44:37.761
My own mother sold me.

44:39.680 --> 44:42.140
Men used me.

44:43.892 --> 44:46.395
But Akash loves me.

44:47.688 --> 44:52.192
You think it's easy for someone like him
to love someone like me?

44:53.443 --> 44:55.988
If anyone found out about us,

44:55.988 --> 45:00.701
he would lose his position,
his family, everything.

45:02.578 --> 45:07.541
If he can't leave his job
or leave his family...

45:08.250 --> 45:10.669
If they really are
more important than you,

45:11.628 --> 45:13.755
then your love is not equal.

45:14.715 --> 45:16.842
Men love differently to us.

45:18.135 --> 45:21.263
It's a rare man
who doesn't love himself most in the end.

45:24.808 --> 45:27.394
You're a whore from Kamathipura, Sunita.

45:28.604 --> 45:33.108
He pretends he'll run off with you,
but he won't.

45:33.817 --> 45:36.445
Not for you. Not for anyone.

45:37.196 --> 45:41.658
When he turns his back on you,
where would you go?

45:44.453 --> 45:48.290
Then you will realize that your life
without him was better anyway.

45:49.875 --> 45:51.752
What do you want from him?

45:53.337 --> 45:54.796
Only for him to do his job.

45:56.131 --> 45:58.967
I mean Akash no ill will.

46:00.177 --> 46:01.386
I promise.

46:02.054 --> 46:06.600
You have my word
that if you make the call,

46:08.268 --> 46:10.896
I will do him no harm.

46:13.565 --> 46:15.442
Madame Zhou owns your debt now.

46:16.902 --> 46:20.197
She's going to put you to work
soon enough.

46:20.197 --> 46:23.408
Will Pandey want you then?

46:25.327 --> 46:29.790
Make the call,
and if he comes to take you away,

46:29.790 --> 46:34.628
then we will know he loves you as you say.

46:42.010 --> 46:44.972
I don't think
you've ever loved anyone in your life.

48:51.640 --> 48:55.143
Go to hell, motherfucking <i>bhenchods</i>!

48:55.727 --> 48:59.773
You are wanting our water?
Take it from my dead fucking hands!

51:04.648 --> 51:05.732
Linbaba!

51:05.732 --> 51:07.901
Should I call you Johnny Dangerous?

51:08.902 --> 51:10.654
Arun's Life. Enjoy.

51:10.654 --> 51:13.031
No, no. Not for me.
-I insist.

51:16.910 --> 51:20.914
<i>I could feel my heart breaking
as I watched them all enjoy their victory.</i>

51:21.456 --> 51:24.793
<i>Whatever came next,
no one could take today from them.</i>

51:25.752 --> 51:28.380
<i>I'd stayed because I owed them something.</i>

51:28.380 --> 51:31.258
<i>But now the last thing
I wanted to do was leave.</i>

51:54.698 --> 51:56.116
<i>Arre,</i> Linbaba!

52:22.684 --> 52:23.769
Catapult.

52:30.108 --> 52:31.193
You're a bad shot.

52:32.444 --> 52:33.570
Bad for me, anyway.

52:35.614 --> 52:37.616
What did my brother Lin do
to deserve this?

52:39.201 --> 52:40.410
He killed my mother.

52:42.329 --> 52:44.915
And they say he didn't,
but I know it is true.

52:47.543 --> 52:50.754
My mother is dead too.
We have this in common.

52:53.048 --> 52:54.466
What did you do?

52:55.092 --> 52:56.927
I found something new to belong to.

52:59.721 --> 53:01.849
Abdel Khader Khan is a general.

53:01.849 --> 53:03.851
And a general always needs warriors.

53:06.645 --> 53:09.273
Someday I want a bike like yours.

53:13.735 --> 53:14.903
One day, maybe.

53:16.446 --> 53:19.950
But a warrior has to follow orders,
even when they don't like them.

53:21.660 --> 53:24.246
Just tell me what to do.
I can do anything.

53:24.246 --> 53:26.665
Lin is important to Khaderbhai.

53:27.291 --> 53:28.417
He's a warrior too.

53:29.376 --> 53:31.712
We will be upset
if anything happened to him.

53:33.213 --> 53:35.340
Do we understand each other?
-Yes.

53:40.679 --> 53:42.222
A warrior needs his weapon.

53:43.765 --> 53:46.185
Get some practice. For all our sakes.

54:01.116 --> 54:02.868
<i>Someone once asked me,</i>

54:03.660 --> 54:05.954
<i>"If you could be really happy,</i>

54:05.954 --> 54:08.665
<i>but knew from the start
that it would end in sadness,</i>

54:09.917 --> 54:13.003
<i>would you choose that happiness
or would you avoid it?"</i>

54:14.713 --> 54:18.133
<i>In that moment, I realized my answer.</i>

54:19.468 --> 54:23.263
<i>I would choose the happiness.
No matter how much it hurt.</i>

54:25.682 --> 54:27.518
<i>But I still had to run.</i>
