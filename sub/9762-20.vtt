WEBVTT

00:06.632 --> 00:09.920
I, personally, will go
and attend to Stage Three.

00:10.135 --> 00:13.798
D-Dabra... You're sure
you can beat them, right?

00:14.014 --> 00:15.675
Am I sure?

00:16.934 --> 00:19.801
I am the King of the Demon Realm, Dabra!

00:20.020 --> 00:22.807
Whether they have 3,000 kilis or 4,000 kilis,

00:23.023 --> 00:27.266
there is no one in the world
whose power is superior to my own!

00:29.279 --> 00:33.522
Dabra, who volunteered
to fight in the third stage,

00:33.742 --> 00:38.406
locked himself inside a
meditation room to boost his Ki.

00:38.622 --> 00:42.206
Elsewhere, the Tenkaichi Budokai
had gotten underway again

00:42.418 --> 00:45.251
with a battle royal featuring
the remaining contestants.

00:45.462 --> 00:47.248
Who will last through the bout to win?

00:47.464 --> 00:55.212
Goten and Trunks' Mighty Mask?
No. 18? Or perhaps even Mister Satan?

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074

02:24.311 --> 02:29.806
"Stunning Youngsters!! No. 18's Uphill Battle."

03:04.685 --> 03:06.721
Still? This is taking too long.

03:06.937 --> 03:10.521
You don't suppose, Vegeta-san and Father,
that you were so amazing

03:10.732 --> 03:12.142
that they've all lost their nerve?

03:12.359 --> 03:16.102
Well, let's just wait patiently.
There ain't no hurry.

04:07.623 --> 04:08.738
Amazing!

04:08.957 --> 04:13.291
Dabra's Ki is skyrocketing! Rise even higher!

04:13.503 --> 04:16.209
Leave it to the King of the
Demon Realm of Darkness.

04:19.760 --> 04:23.799
Good. Very good, Dabra.

04:24.014 --> 04:27.347
Majin Boo's revival is coming into view!

04:44.826 --> 04:47.818
It's a battle royal to decide the
winner of the Tenkaichi Budokai,

04:48.038 --> 04:51.701
a-and what's this? A fierce fight
between Contestant No. 18

04:51.917 --> 04:54.909
and Contestant Mighty Mask
is unfolding in mid-air!

05:00.342 --> 05:01.457
Sh-Shoot!

05:01.677 --> 05:04.089
Punch her! Throw punches, Trunks-kun!

05:04.304 --> 05:07.467
I know! But I can't get my back into it!

05:16.024 --> 05:17.434
Good one, good one!

05:17.651 --> 05:19.312
Of the five remaining entrants,

05:19.528 --> 05:21.189
Contestant Jewel and Contestant Killa

05:21.405 --> 05:23.862
have already been disqualified
for leaving the ring!

05:26.410 --> 05:29.197
All that remain are Contestant No. 18
and Contestant Mighty Mask,

05:29.413 --> 05:32.325
as well as the heavy favorite, Mister Satan!

05:49.599 --> 05:50.429
Whoa!

05:50.642 --> 05:53.884
Awesome! I've never seen
anything this awesome before!

05:54.104 --> 05:57.346
--No. 18! Hang in there!
--Good luck, Mommy!

05:57.566 --> 06:01.525
Go on and kick that masked jerk's butt!

06:01.737 --> 06:04.149
We're not getting many cheers, huh?

06:04.364 --> 06:08.698
This Mighty Mask guy
must be pretty unpopular.

06:21.965 --> 06:24.047
That guy's pretty good, huh?

06:27.637 --> 06:31.050
This is hopeless, if they're that serious...

06:38.774 --> 06:40.264
This is one weird freak.

06:40.484 --> 06:43.442
His arms and legs are
awfully short for his body.

06:43.653 --> 06:45.860
Even so, he's unusually strong.

06:52.412 --> 06:57.452
No. 18-san sure is strong, all right.
Not at all like that Killa!

06:57.667 --> 06:59.749
Stick with it, Trunks-kun!

06:59.961 --> 07:03.499
Goten! You haven't been
doing a thing, have you?

07:03.715 --> 07:05.046
Kick, or something!

07:05.258 --> 07:07.465
But I can't see very well!

07:07.677 --> 07:11.215
This is no time to complain about that!
Look, if you get her good,

07:11.431 --> 07:14.298
I'm willing to let you have one more toy!

07:14.518 --> 07:15.348
Y-You mean it?!

07:15.560 --> 07:17.221
--Yeah!
--Yay!

07:17.437 --> 07:19.428
All right, I'll try!

07:21.108 --> 07:22.473
Let's go, Goten!

07:22.692 --> 07:24.193
Uh-huh!

07:37.874 --> 07:40.411
Strange. I can't read his moves.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.039
Trunks-kun, that was a good punch!

07:43.255 --> 07:45.997
Mm-hmm! Goten, you keep
it up, too! Here we go!

07:46.216 --> 07:47.706
Yeah!

07:53.807 --> 07:54.922
She's losing!

07:55.142 --> 07:56.598
I'm sure she's fine.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.426
What's the matter, No. 18?!

07:59.646 --> 08:04.515
Kn-Knock it off already... I'm begging you...

08:04.734 --> 08:07.020
All right! We're winning!

08:07.237 --> 08:08.727
Uh-huh!

08:25.839 --> 08:28.000
Whoa, he's dead...

08:48.236 --> 08:51.945
To think that I'll have to
fight one of those two...

08:52.157 --> 08:54.899
How did it come to this?

09:24.856 --> 09:29.270
Rah! I didn't get knocked out!

09:42.666 --> 09:43.621
Ow-w-w-w. . .

09:43.833 --> 09:46.165
Are you all right, Trunks?

09:48.004 --> 09:49.744
That one was intense!

09:49.965 --> 09:53.583
All right, let's switch. I'll be the top now.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.508
Mm-hmm, that might be a good idea.

10:02.519 --> 10:07.513
C-Contestant Mighty Mask? Do you give up?

10:09.067 --> 10:10.557
No, I don't!

10:12.237 --> 10:13.852
Oh! He got back up!

10:14.072 --> 10:14.936
He's up! He's up!

10:15.156 --> 10:16.407
Way to go, way to go!

10:16.616 --> 10:19.949
Contestant Mighty Mask is
doin' pretty good, isn't he?

10:33.883 --> 10:35.874
He's moving differently!

10:40.724 --> 10:42.180
Now! Go, Goten!

10:42.392 --> 10:43.882
Uh-huh!

10:46.646 --> 10:48.978
--We did it!
--All right, let's keep that up!

10:49.190 --> 10:50.691
Yeah!

11:00.160 --> 11:00.945
All right, let's finish her!

11:01.161 --> 11:02.651
Yeah!

11:05.332 --> 11:06.822
Ah! That was a close one!

11:07.042 --> 11:09.909
It really is hard to move in this outfit, huh?

11:11.004 --> 11:13.711
You really do move around in an unusual way.

11:13.923 --> 11:16.460
Mommy! Good luck!

11:16.676 --> 11:19.839
Be sure to win!

11:20.055 --> 11:22.762
All right. I won't be beaten.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.810
Good luck!

11:30.023 --> 11:31.763
l'll win, no matter what!

11:31.983 --> 11:35.601
For some reason, the look in
No. 18's eye is starting to change!

11:35.820 --> 11:39.233
Never mind, attack harder!
You won't get any toys like this!

11:39.449 --> 11:44.443
Y-You can't say that! You promised me,
didn't you?! No fair! No fair!

11:46.247 --> 11:47.828
Ah, you idiot!

11:56.299 --> 11:58.836
W-What a tremendous battle!

11:59.052 --> 12:02.135
It's a fight worthy of the championship
match of the Tenkaichi Budokai!

12:02.347 --> 12:05.430
To be honest, I did not think
that Contestant Mighty Mask

12:05.642 --> 12:08.349
could fight anywhere near this well!

12:11.356 --> 12:14.018
You've got to keep your
eyes forward, you know!

12:14.234 --> 12:16.065
I'll take over on top again.

12:16.277 --> 12:17.778
Uh-huh.

12:22.117 --> 12:25.450
D-Do you give up this time?

12:28.665 --> 12:31.623
Once again, Contestant
Mighty Mask is back up!

12:31.835 --> 12:33.496
What perseverance!

12:33.711 --> 12:36.293
We didn't see anything like this
at the last tournament!

12:36.506 --> 12:39.213
This can no longer be
considered a battle royal!

12:39.426 --> 12:41.633
This is completely a one-on-one match

12:41.845 --> 12:45.258
between Contestant No. 18
and Contestant Mighty Mask!

12:45.473 --> 12:47.259
I'm sick of this...

13:02.365 --> 13:04.026
Evade, Goten!

13:24.429 --> 13:26.761
We can't beat her like this.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.885
Let's turn Super Saiyan, Trunks-kun!

13:30.101 --> 13:34.185
Y-Yeah! As long as we're wearing this,
nobody will know, huh?

13:34.397 --> 13:35.762
All right, shall we?

13:35.982 --> 13:37.483
Uh-huh!

13:41.571 --> 13:42.902
Goten, ready?

13:43.114 --> 13:44.615
Okay!

13:51.122 --> 13:54.580
What's that? What happened?

13:54.792 --> 13:57.579
What is that? He's glowing.

14:02.425 --> 14:05.007
Either way, this outfit is still a handicap to us,

14:05.220 --> 14:07.085
so we'll have to finish this with a Ki blast!

14:07.305 --> 14:09.967
Huh? But are you sure we should?

14:10.183 --> 14:13.266
No problem! As long as we do it
within reason, it won't kill her.

14:13.478 --> 14:15.264
It's No. 18-san, after all.

14:18.566 --> 14:22.980
| see now. Super Saiyan, huh?

14:23.196 --> 14:28.156
I've finally figured out who you are, boys.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.155
Trunks-kun, don't put
everything you've got into it!

14:31.371 --> 14:33.236
Yeah, I know!

14:53.059 --> 14:53.844
I knew it.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.891
Sheesh! I missed!

14:56.104 --> 14:58.766
Let's keep going at her!

14:58.982 --> 15:00.643
Y-You've got to be kidding!

15:00.858 --> 15:03.645
That energy blast had incredible
speed and destructive force!

15:03.861 --> 15:07.945
|-| get the feeling those kids
have tremendous abilities!

15:08.157 --> 15:12.116
This is big trouble. I have to
settle this with them, fast!

15:12.328 --> 15:15.616
It's about time I beat you! Trunks! Goten!

15:15.832 --> 15:18.744
Eep! Sh-She knows!

15:18.960 --> 15:20.996
--Yikes!
--She means business!

15:27.302 --> 15:31.796
Aah! C-Contestant Mighty Mask
has been torn apart!

15:32.015 --> 15:35.052
You idiot, Goten! Why did you run that way?!

15:35.268 --> 15:36.849
Why didn 't you, Trunks-kun?!

15:37.061 --> 15:41.350
What the--?! G-Goten!
l was wonderin' where you went off to!

15:41.566 --> 15:43.807
And the other one is Trunks!

15:45.236 --> 15:48.103
It was the two of them, all right.

15:48.323 --> 15:50.279
W-What do we do, Trunks-kun?

15:50.491 --> 15:53.779
We've got no choice.
At this point, we go all-out!

15:55.830 --> 15:56.740
--Here goes!
--Yeah!

15:56.956 --> 15:58.457
Hey!

16:05.673 --> 16:08.836
Th-There's no fighting as pairs!
You're disqualified!

16:09.052 --> 16:10.758
Disqualified!

16:10.970 --> 16:12.255
D-Disqualified?

16:12.472 --> 16:14.178
Uh-oh. Let's get out of here!

16:14.390 --> 16:15.891
Uh-huh.

16:17.727 --> 16:20.184
See here, Goten! Where are you goin'?!

16:20.396 --> 16:23.138
Trunks! Get back here!

16:42.502 --> 16:46.666
W-What an amazing match!
However, according to the rules,

16:46.881 --> 16:49.338
Contestant Mighty Mask is
disqualified for fighting as a pair!

16:49.550 --> 16:53.884
Now, the only ones remaining are
Contestants Mister Satan and No. 18!

16:54.097 --> 16:56.179
Whoever wins will be the ultimate victor!

16:57.183 --> 16:58.844
No. 18, good luck!

16:59.060 --> 17:02.473
--Go, Satan!
--You've come this far, No. 18!

17:02.689 --> 17:04.179
Hang in there!

17:04.398 --> 17:08.311
Mommy! Good luck!

17:09.904 --> 17:16.069
W-What do I do? This time,
I really am dead, for sure!

17:16.285 --> 17:18.662
--Satan!
--Hang in there, Satan!

17:18.871 --> 17:22.079
--Satan!
--Good luck, Satan!

17:22.290 --> 17:24.748
Hang in there, No. 18!

17:24.961 --> 17:28.624
Okay, will the victor of the
Tenkaichi Budokai be Mister Satan,

17:28.840 --> 17:31.047
or will it be Contestant No. 18?!

17:31.259 --> 17:33.341
After that tremendous display
of fighting prowess earlier,

17:33.553 --> 17:35.635
the cheers for Contestant No. 18 are surging!

17:35.847 --> 17:39.965
Which one of them will take away
10 million Zeni in prize money?!

17:42.311 --> 17:46.270
Th-There's no way I'm going
to beat someone like her!

17:46.482 --> 17:49.224
Satan! Let her have it!

17:49.444 --> 17:50.934
Satan!

17:52.447 --> 17:56.565
Mister Satan! Good luck!

17:58.453 --> 18:00.489
Go get her, Mister Satan!

18:03.583 --> 18:05.448
Let her have it!

18:15.511 --> 18:16.967
--Satan!
--Go, Satan!

18:17.180 --> 18:21.924
Okay! Come at me any way you like!

18:24.979 --> 18:26.890
Yeah, come on!

18:34.530 --> 18:38.148
--Young lady!
--Don't take that from her, Satan!

18:39.577 --> 18:41.613
Hey, what is this, what is this?!

18:42.622 --> 18:45.079
Isn't it nice for your mommy?

18:45.291 --> 18:48.328
She'll be gettin' 10 million Zeni.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.284
It's all hers!

18:50.505 --> 18:53.338
--This is no time to laugh, Muten Roshi-sama.
--She's got it, she's got it!

18:53.549 --> 18:56.666
What on earth are Goku and
the others going through?

18:58.888 --> 19:00.503
Y-You're right about that.

19:00.723 --> 19:03.430
Where on earth could they have gone?

19:11.067 --> 19:13.524
Tch! Rats!

19:13.736 --> 19:16.227
How did she know it was us?

19:16.447 --> 19:18.529
No. 18-san is a sure thing to win now, huh?

19:18.741 --> 19:21.403
Sure thing, nothing...! Huh?

19:23.496 --> 19:24.986
Isn't that...

19:28.793 --> 19:30.579
Ah! It's Videl-san!

19:30.795 --> 19:33.411
Hey! Videl-san!

19:34.423 --> 19:36.209
Videl-san!

19:37.218 --> 19:39.129
Goten-kun!

19:39.345 --> 19:41.336
Hey, wait up, Goten!

20:04.996 --> 20:06.452
This is taking so long...

20:06.664 --> 20:09.030
l hope someone comes out soon.

20:13.004 --> 20:15.871
The way I see it, he'll eliminate those three,

20:16.090 --> 20:19.753
and collect lots of energy
for Majin Boo's revival.

20:19.969 --> 20:22.961
I'm sure glad that I brought Dabra along.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.640
The higher his evil Ki is raised,

20:35.860 --> 20:39.944
the easier it is for me to control his mind.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.705
Oh, Dabra!

21:01.719 --> 21:04.256
I apologize for the delay.

21:04.472 --> 21:07.635
At last, Dabra, King of the
Demon Realm of Darkness,

21:07.850 --> 21:10.808
is ready to fight.

21:11.020 --> 21:18.062
Will Gohan be able to defeat Dabra
and safely clear Stage Three?

21:18.277 --> 21:22.361
And who will be the victor
of the Tenkaichi Budokai?

22:42.111 --> 22:43.567
Heya! l'm Goku!

22:43.779 --> 22:48.273
Aww, Gohan... You ain't been
training without me around, huh?

22:48.492 --> 22:50.448
Dabra's got the upper hand
against you, doesn't he?

22:50.661 --> 22:53.653
Do you really think you can
stand up to me like this?

22:53.873 --> 22:57.081
I've had enough of you looking down on
the King of the Demon Realm of Darkness!

22:57.293 --> 22:58.783
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:59.003 --> 23:01.665
