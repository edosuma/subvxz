00:04.226 --> 00:06.433
Hey, Dean. It's me.

00:08.898 --> 00:11.104
How long you been back, Sam?
About a year.

00:11.275 --> 00:13.433
You been back practically
this whole time?

00:13.611 --> 00:16.695
You finally had what you wanted.
I wanted my brother, alive.

00:16.864 --> 00:20.612
You wanted a family. You only
gave it up because of the way we lived.

00:20.784 --> 00:23.406
But you had something,
and you were building something.

00:23.579 --> 00:26.580
You got out, Dean.
You walked away from the life...

00:26.749 --> 00:30.248
and it's as close to happiness
as I've ever seen a hunter get.

00:30.461 --> 00:33.378
- I hooked up with other people.
- You? Working with strangers?

00:33.547 --> 00:36.584
- They're more like family.
- Gwen Campbell, Christian, and Mark.

00:36.759 --> 00:38.716
- Campbell, like-
- Like your mom.

00:40.804 --> 00:43.177
I'm your grandfather.

00:45.810 --> 00:48.514
Samuel? You can't be.

00:48.687 --> 00:51.392
We're guessing whatever pulled Sam up
pulled me down.

00:51.565 --> 00:53.973
- But you don't know what that is.
- Bingo.

00:54.235 --> 00:56.986
Shapeshifter.
Can make itself look like anyone.

00:57.154 --> 01:00.606
Legends of creatures who can transform
into animals or other men.

01:00.783 --> 01:03.903
When the Shapeshifter changes shape,
maybe it sheds.

01:05.453 --> 01:07.910
- You coming?
- No. I'm going back for Lisa and Ben.

01:08.082 --> 01:11.581
- You'll be putting them in danger.
- It's better to leave them alone?

01:11.794 --> 01:13.122
Unprotected?

01:13.295 --> 01:16.082
I made them vulnerable the moment
I knocked on their door.

01:16.257 --> 01:18.130
You keep in touch, you hear?

01:18.300 --> 01:19.960
Of course.

01:41.991 --> 01:43.533
No.

02:05.347 --> 02:09.131
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

02:09.810 --> 02:11.221
Okay.

02:39.298 --> 02:40.626
Shh.

02:56.941 --> 02:58.221
Shh.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.841
- What's up?
- Nothing.

04:17.480 --> 04:20.683
At least wait till you've checked
the place out before you hate it.

04:20.899 --> 04:23.106
Open mind. It's all I ask.

04:24.778 --> 04:27.352
Yeah, all right.

04:31.410 --> 04:33.699
- I'll be back.
- Oh. Hey, where's the fire?

04:34.914 --> 04:36.871
I'm just gonna check out the block.

04:39.043 --> 04:42.376
And let your mom unpack the kitchen
by herself? Come on.

04:43.464 --> 04:46.500
We'll go for lunch later.
Scope out the neighborhood. Right?

04:48.928 --> 04:50.967
Yeah, sounds like a plan.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.433
Come on,
why don't you give me a hand?

05:02.066 --> 05:05.186
<i>Fifty-five,
we've got a callback on those plates.</i>

05:05.361 --> 05:08.196
Where'd you find them?
We found the parents upstairs.

05:08.364 --> 05:11.199
- Pretty brutal.
- Break-in?

05:11.408 --> 05:13.033
Alarm never went off.

05:13.202 --> 05:15.693
Any leads on the baby? None yet.

05:15.871 --> 05:18.658
So, what do you think?
You think it's okay? Alive?

05:19.250 --> 05:20.625
I did yesterday.

05:23.587 --> 05:25.081
Thank you.

05:36.767 --> 05:37.846
- Hi.
- Hey.

05:38.811 --> 05:40.186
Uh, one cheese, one everything?

05:40.354 --> 05:42.097
Yeah.

05:42.273 --> 05:44.396
Thank you. There you go.
Keep the change.

05:44.567 --> 05:46.393
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

05:51.824 --> 05:53.698
- What?
- Thought we were going out.

05:54.702 --> 05:56.244
Oh, yeah. I forgot. I'm sorry.

05:57.037 --> 06:00.703
Sure. I'll look for plates.

06:05.504 --> 06:08.078
Hey. So I been all over this.

06:08.924 --> 06:10.751
No sulfur, no EMF.

06:10.926 --> 06:13.464
Starting to think maybe
it's not our kind of thing.

06:13.637 --> 06:16.045
Four couples slaughtered
in one part of the state.

06:16.223 --> 06:19.758
That's four babies taken
from locked houses.

06:19.935 --> 06:22.509
Damn it.

06:23.606 --> 06:25.931
Explain to me
how any version of that is natural.

06:26.108 --> 06:27.935
I agree, it's awful. I'm just saying...

06:28.110 --> 06:31.396
<i>this one might be on the police.
So either we got monsters...</i>

06:31.572 --> 06:34.822
grabbing babies to make baby stew,
or we got a bunch yokels...

06:34.992 --> 06:39.619
<i>grabbing babies to make baby stew.
Either way, it's baby stew. Which is bad.</i>

06:41.999 --> 06:43.956
Am I boring you?
You got someplace to be?

06:44.126 --> 06:45.455
<i>No, no. I get it. Good.</i>

06:45.628 --> 06:48.582
You know,
sometimes I wonder about you, Sam.

06:48.797 --> 06:50.956
Sometimes I wonder about me too.

06:51.175 --> 06:55.220
Well, I will go back over everything,
see if there's anything we missed.

06:58.307 --> 07:01.723
Hey, detective said the alarm
in the house never went off.

07:01.894 --> 07:05.844
See if anybody else had a system
from Harper Caine Security.

07:06.023 --> 07:07.897
<i>Yeah. Sure.</i>

07:08.067 --> 07:10.818
Any chance I get to hop on a computer.

07:18.494 --> 07:21.032
What the hell?
Hey, hey. Give me that.

07:21.205 --> 07:24.538
- What do you think you're doing?
- I just wanted to see it.

07:24.708 --> 07:26.037
Listen to me.

07:26.210 --> 07:28.997
Don't ever open this trunk,
you understand me?

07:29.213 --> 07:31.087
Okay, sorry.

07:32.800 --> 07:36.465
But I don't get it. You had your own rifle
when you were my age.

07:36.637 --> 07:40.469
Ben, mark my words:
you will never, ever shoot a gun.

07:40.641 --> 07:42.515
- Ever.
- I know what's going on.

07:42.685 --> 07:45.223
- Something might be coming for us.
- There's nothing coming for us.

07:45.396 --> 07:47.435
I could do what you do.
You could teach-

07:47.606 --> 07:49.563
Shut up about the freaking gun, okay?

07:51.235 --> 07:52.813
Okay.

07:53.112 --> 07:54.689
Sorry.

07:55.906 --> 07:57.531
I'm sorry.

08:24.685 --> 08:27.354
You were right.
Every family, Harper Caine Security.

08:27.563 --> 08:29.105
<i>So I pulled the client records.</i>

08:29.273 --> 08:31.396
To see if there's any families
who fit the profile.

08:31.567 --> 08:34.023
There is another happy couple,
walking and talking.

08:34.195 --> 08:36.400
Six-month-old baby.
Like all the others.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.155
What's the address?

08:41.910 --> 08:43.369
Hey.

08:44.497 --> 08:47.367
What happened? Ben's been locked
in his room for hours.

08:47.541 --> 08:50.495
Says you yelled at him. What'd he do?

08:51.253 --> 08:53.080
Nothing.

08:53.255 --> 08:55.248
What did you do?

08:58.219 --> 09:01.303
He got into my tools.
I shouldn't have got mad.

09:01.847 --> 09:03.176
You wanna talk about this?

09:03.766 --> 09:05.474
About?

09:05.643 --> 09:07.552
Yelling at Ben?
Keeping us in the house?

09:07.728 --> 09:09.934
- I'm trying to keep us safe.
- I'm not arguing.

09:10.105 --> 09:11.516
I'm just asking.

09:13.192 --> 09:16.276
You said that you and your brother
killed whatever was after us.

09:16.445 --> 09:19.280
And then- And then we moved,
just to be sure.

09:19.448 --> 09:22.734
So, what is it, Dean? A monster?
Or monsters in general?

09:22.910 --> 09:25.579
I don't know. Something might come.

09:25.746 --> 09:27.869
- What?
- I can't predict what's gonna come.

09:28.082 --> 09:30.489
I need parameters.
We have to live our lives.

09:30.668 --> 09:32.826
At some point, I have to work.
Ben has school.

09:33.045 --> 09:35.750
But if something happens
on my watch...

09:35.965 --> 09:41.339
I know you're trying to protect us.
But you're kind of scaring me a little too.

12:30.014 --> 12:32.220
- Sam?
- I need your help. Now.

12:32.391 --> 12:34.348
- What's wrong?
- I'm working this job.

12:34.518 --> 12:37.092
<i>Dude.
Look, I just need you with me on this.</i>

12:37.271 --> 12:39.560
I'm out. I'm staying out.

12:39.732 --> 12:42.104
- Make an exception.
- For what?

12:44.069 --> 12:45.398
Look, I'm 30 minutes away...

12:45.571 --> 12:48.323
and I will drive to your door
if you don't meet me.

12:49.867 --> 12:53.117
And what's so nuts you gotta threaten
a damn drive-by?

13:08.302 --> 13:11.718
- Where is it?
- Strapped down in the backseat.

13:18.521 --> 13:20.893
Welcome to the party, Guttenberg.

13:30.564 --> 13:32.556
Okay.

13:32.732 --> 13:34.939
- Show me.
- I got it, we've been over this.

13:35.110 --> 13:36.308
Humor me.

13:36.486 --> 13:38.360
Load clip.

13:38.864 --> 13:41.022
Pull slide. Safety off.

13:41.199 --> 13:43.869
- Safety on.
- And salt the windows and the doors.

13:44.077 --> 13:45.868
Of course.

13:47.247 --> 13:50.082
- Maybe I shouldn't go.
- It's okay. You wanna go. So go.

13:50.250 --> 13:51.329
Sam can handle this.

13:51.501 --> 13:54.585
Dean, no offense,
but if you don't walk out that door...

13:54.754 --> 13:55.917
I'm gonna shoot you.

14:03.180 --> 14:05.717
Bet you're missing your ex
about now. The boring one.

14:05.891 --> 14:07.930
God, shut up.

14:08.935 --> 14:10.892
Just be careful, okay?

14:14.399 --> 14:17.151
Bye.

14:38.173 --> 14:40.047
So, what do we know
about this thing?

14:40.217 --> 14:44.546
Well, it was fast. And it freaked
when I cut it with silver.

14:44.721 --> 14:46.548
All right. So that narrows it down to?

14:46.723 --> 14:52.097
A ghoul, a zombie, a Shifter
or about a dozen other things.

14:53.271 --> 14:55.643
I don't recall seeing babynapping
in the profiles.

14:55.815 --> 14:57.607
Yeah. Exactly.

15:02.405 --> 15:05.323
Well, feel free to speak up
if you know anything.

15:07.869 --> 15:09.328
Seatbelt.

15:09.496 --> 15:12.117
What am I, in third grade?

15:12.290 --> 15:14.082
A car should drive,
not be a little bitch.

15:19.005 --> 15:21.331
Yeah, don't take it personal.

15:22.342 --> 15:24.050
Well, we need to get some supplies.

15:24.219 --> 15:26.710
I got an arsenal in the trunk.

15:26.888 --> 15:28.003
Not that kind.

15:35.522 --> 15:40.267
I'm pretty sure there's some kind of jelly
you're supposed to put on their butt.

15:40.986 --> 15:43.358
Like, uh-Like that?

15:43.530 --> 15:45.357
Yeah. Grab that.

15:48.201 --> 15:50.823
- So how do you know all this?
- Uh, Lisa's got a baby niece.

15:50.996 --> 15:52.656
So I've been on a few milk runs.

15:53.915 --> 15:54.994
- Huh.
- Shut it.

15:55.166 --> 15:56.246
I just said, "huh."

15:56.418 --> 15:58.161
I just said, "shut it."

16:02.465 --> 16:06.084
All right, we gotta get moving.
We got the waterworks in T-minus-10.

16:11.558 --> 16:13.349
Hi.

16:18.398 --> 16:19.643
Shh.

16:21.443 --> 16:24.064
Come on. Hang in there, buddy.
Hang in there, man.

16:24.237 --> 16:25.897
Dean, make it stop.

16:26.072 --> 16:27.864
How?

16:28.033 --> 16:30.820
Everyone's staring at us
like we're child abusers.

16:32.162 --> 16:34.119
Feed it. We fed it.

16:34.289 --> 16:36.697
- Then what?
- Do you think I speak baby?

16:36.875 --> 16:39.330
Maybe he needs a diaper change.

16:39.502 --> 16:41.542
Oh, God, I hope not.

16:59.022 --> 17:00.564
Aw.

17:00.774 --> 17:03.691
What's the matter?
What's his name?

17:03.860 --> 17:05.733
- Bobby.
- John.

17:05.904 --> 17:09.189
- Bobby John.
- Hi, Bobby John.

17:09.366 --> 17:11.904
Aren't you handsome. May I?

17:12.285 --> 17:13.614
Oh. Uh...

17:16.373 --> 17:19.290
I see now. Bobby John's a little wet.

17:21.336 --> 17:23.874
No offense, you two look exhausted.

17:24.714 --> 17:28.048
I don't mind. Lord knows
I've changed a million diapers.

17:28.218 --> 17:30.970
Ha, ha. It's...

17:35.517 --> 17:39.301
Well, that's a really nice offer,
thank you. But I think we've got it.

17:39.479 --> 17:41.388
Oh, it's nothing, happy to help.

17:42.524 --> 17:44.931
Give me the baby
before I stab you in your neck.

17:45.569 --> 17:46.979
Dean.

18:06.131 --> 18:07.874
- Help me!
- Hey!

18:08.049 --> 18:10.089
He's hurting me!

18:10.260 --> 18:12.217
Get off of her.

18:12.387 --> 18:15.637
Okay. All right. All right.

18:23.398 --> 18:24.892
Go, go, go.

18:40.373 --> 18:42.829
The hell's a Shifter
want with a baby, anyway?

18:43.001 --> 18:45.622
- You tell me.
- And how the hell did it find us?

18:47.380 --> 18:49.753
Who designed this thing, NASA?

18:49.925 --> 18:52.297
It could have been
following me this whole time.

18:52.469 --> 18:55.386
- Since the baby's house.
- We gotta get off the road.

18:55.555 --> 18:57.512
Get Bobby John here
someplace safe...

18:57.682 --> 18:59.971
figure this thing out.
Okay. All right. Shh.

19:00.143 --> 19:01.388
Easy, kid.

19:03.104 --> 19:04.848
<i>Patrol 86, go ahead.</i>

19:05.023 --> 19:07.395
Need a 1028 on lllinois plates.

19:07.567 --> 19:11.945
I as in India, four, Zulu,
Oscar, eight, nine, two.

19:12.113 --> 19:14.272
<i>Copy, 86. Stand by.</i>

19:27.045 --> 19:30.295
Okay. All right, you know what?
I'll pay you money if you sit still.

19:32.300 --> 19:35.005
This is like diffusing an IED
with poop.

19:36.888 --> 19:38.881
Okay. All right, all right, all right.

19:39.057 --> 19:43.304
You are golden, Bobby John.

19:43.478 --> 19:44.853
Time to hit the hay.

19:51.236 --> 19:53.145
You're just gonna make it
cranky again.

19:53.363 --> 19:54.988
Shh. It's working.

19:56.783 --> 20:00.484
Okay. If I put you down,
you gonna be a man about it? Hmm?

20:08.670 --> 20:10.045
Huh.

20:10.797 --> 20:14.498
- What?
- You're just, uh, actually...

20:14.676 --> 20:16.467
not awful at that.

20:16.636 --> 20:18.296
I'm barely keeping that thing alive.

20:18.471 --> 20:22.090
No, no, no. Seriously. You got a whole
Dr. Huxtable vibe coming off of you.

20:22.267 --> 20:24.141
You're, like, father material.

20:24.311 --> 20:27.762
Yeah, well, I kind of had to be lately,
you know? Sink or swim, right?

20:27.939 --> 20:30.430
- You mean Ben.
- Yeah, I mean Ben.

20:33.445 --> 20:35.437
I mean, I know he's not my kid...

20:35.614 --> 20:39.446
but I don't know,
I'm starting to feel like, yeah, he is.

20:43.163 --> 20:45.784
When I think about
the way we grew up...

20:46.791 --> 20:49.164
I don't know,
I feel like I have a chance to...

20:49.336 --> 20:52.005
do something different with Ben,
you know?

20:54.716 --> 20:56.874
You sure about that?

20:57.052 --> 20:58.760
What do you mean?

21:02.432 --> 21:07.260
Look, you clearly care about the kid.

21:07.979 --> 21:10.933
- But?
- But moving them around...

21:11.107 --> 21:13.147
keeping them on lockdown...

21:13.360 --> 21:15.685
I mean, you do have them
on lockdown, right?

21:19.991 --> 21:22.482
How is any of that different
from how we were raised?

21:23.787 --> 21:25.945
So you're saying...

21:27.958 --> 21:31.208
I'm not shoving anybody
into this life, okay? This is temporary.

21:31.378 --> 21:34.248
Ha, ha. Dad always said
it was temporary, Dean.

21:34.422 --> 21:36.960
Said it for 22 years.

21:37.843 --> 21:40.049
Look, I get it.
You wanna watch out for them.

21:40.220 --> 21:43.838
That's great. I'm just asking,
how do you do that...

21:44.015 --> 21:45.640
and not turn into Dad?

21:59.197 --> 22:02.613
Crap. I can't believe I missed this.

22:02.784 --> 22:03.815
What?

22:03.994 --> 22:07.861
This house on Elm. The mother
was killed, baby was grabbed...

22:08.039 --> 22:11.788
but Daddy wasn't living in the house
at the time. So he's still alive.

22:12.002 --> 22:14.671
- What do you say we go chat?
- I say let's.

22:18.133 --> 22:19.757
You go.

22:19.968 --> 22:22.637
- You sure?
- You got a badge for Bobby John?

22:22.804 --> 22:24.880
Yeah, I'm sure.

22:35.358 --> 22:36.983
It's good, isn't it?

22:38.403 --> 22:41.190
I just-I still can't believe it.

22:41.364 --> 22:47.533
I mean it's one thing to die like that,
the poor baby...

22:47.746 --> 22:51.197
Just into thin air.
No thanks to you guys.

22:52.417 --> 22:54.374
Well, that's why I'm here.

22:55.754 --> 22:57.960
You had filed for divorce?

22:58.965 --> 23:01.124
It's important. I'm sorry.

23:01.301 --> 23:02.843
She-

23:03.887 --> 23:07.635
She cheated on me,
and, well, I caught her.

23:09.351 --> 23:12.020
And did you know the other man?

23:12.187 --> 23:17.561
No, I mean I didn't "catch her" catch her.
But she lied to me.

23:18.151 --> 23:19.480
Okay.

23:21.905 --> 23:23.316
We hadn't...

23:24.866 --> 23:26.111
you know...

23:26.284 --> 23:29.285
in a while, and then-
Then she's pregnant.

23:29.454 --> 23:32.028
- And what did she say?
- She said it was mine.

23:32.207 --> 23:36.370
I know. And I said that's impossible,
and what is she talking about.

23:36.545 --> 23:39.415
And she says don't you remember
when you went out of town...

23:39.589 --> 23:41.463
you came back early and we-

23:43.051 --> 23:45.257
- But you didn't?
- No.

23:46.096 --> 23:48.847
I was at a damn
softball tournament.

23:49.015 --> 23:51.933
Whoever he was, he's the father.

24:22.966 --> 24:25.255
<i>Yeah?
Talked to the father. He checks out.</i>

24:25.427 --> 24:27.004
<i>- The baby?
- Yeah.</i>

24:27.179 --> 24:29.551
I think the Shapeshifter is his dad.

24:32.601 --> 24:34.095
You think?

24:45.477 --> 24:47.933
Manager. Everything okay in there?

24:48.105 --> 24:50.560
Yeah, no, we're fine.
Thank you. Good night.

24:50.732 --> 24:53.270
There's been complaints.
Mind opening the door, sir?

24:53.443 --> 24:56.148
Uh, it's not a good time.

24:56.363 --> 24:58.154
Just got out of the shower.

25:20.887 --> 25:22.714
- Get out of the way.
- Not gonna happen.

25:22.889 --> 25:24.549
A child should be with his father.

25:24.725 --> 25:28.259
Well, I gotta be honest, I'm not really
seeing the family resemblance.

25:29.604 --> 25:32.938
I'm not just talking about me.
I'm talking about our father.

25:56.590 --> 25:58.048
Well, there goes our deposit.

26:06.767 --> 26:10.017
It's pretty smart, actually.
I mean, Shifter poses as a guard...

26:10.187 --> 26:13.022
from the security company,
then it scopes out the fam.

26:13.190 --> 26:16.025
Yeah, then daddy takes off,
and Shifter becomes daddy.

26:16.193 --> 26:18.434
A few glasses of wine,
shakes mama's trees...

26:18.612 --> 26:20.984
comes back in nine months
to collect its prize.

26:21.907 --> 26:23.567
I didn't even know they had babies.

26:23.742 --> 26:26.696
<i>I thought they were
just freaks of nature, like, X-Men style.</i>

26:26.870 --> 26:29.195
You learn something new
every day, huh?

26:30.540 --> 26:32.866
I've never seen
a baby monster before.

26:33.043 --> 26:35.332
Yeah. Of course,
it's not really a monster.

26:35.504 --> 26:39.204
I mean, it's still just a baby.
It's not its fault its dad's a Shifter.

26:39.383 --> 26:41.174
Right, but it's a Shifter too.

26:41.343 --> 26:43.715
Still doesn't change the fact
that we've gotta...

26:43.887 --> 26:45.381
We gotta look after this thing.

26:45.555 --> 26:48.971
But what are we gonna do with it?
We can't drop it off at an orphanage.

26:49.142 --> 26:51.847
They might get upset
when it turns Asian.

26:52.854 --> 26:54.514
- Samuel.
- What?

26:56.066 --> 26:57.774
Samuel. He'll know what to do.

26:57.984 --> 27:01.567
- You wanna bring it to hunters?
- Not just hunters. They're our family.

27:02.280 --> 27:06.230
- We don't know them.
- I do. Not every hunter is a headcase.

27:06.410 --> 27:08.947
I mean,
Samuel is actually a lot like you.

27:10.497 --> 27:15.538
- I'm a freaking headcase.
- Well, pitch a better idea, then.

27:17.963 --> 27:20.798
Great. Samuel it is.

28:02.382 --> 28:05.632
Well, aren't you just the best disguise
a monster ever wore?

28:08.638 --> 28:11.889
I'm kidding, Dean, relax.

28:14.352 --> 28:16.475
What, you got something to say?

28:18.023 --> 28:21.606
No? All right. Well, you just stand there
and think at me.

28:23.278 --> 28:26.113
So, what's our next move?
I got a couple ideas.

28:27.616 --> 28:29.573
Dean, let me see the little guy.

28:29.743 --> 28:33.443
- That's all right. I got it.
- What do you think I'm gonna do?

28:35.207 --> 28:38.243
You really don't want me
to answer that question.

28:39.336 --> 28:42.005
Well, I'm curious.
Who exactly do you think we are?

28:43.799 --> 28:44.961
Hunters.

28:45.884 --> 28:48.457
Funny. Here I've been thinking
we're family.

28:48.637 --> 28:50.795
Hey, let's not get worked up.

28:50.972 --> 28:52.799
Yeah. Yeah. Let's not.

28:56.603 --> 28:59.355
Here. Dean. It's fine.

28:59.523 --> 29:02.014
Let me take him. It's okay.

29:12.160 --> 29:15.363
Hey, there. Oh, you're a big fella,
aren't you?

29:15.580 --> 29:20.077
Yeah. I haven't held one of these
in a long time.

29:20.252 --> 29:24.997
Your mom was the tiniest.
She was bald as a cue ball.

29:27.509 --> 29:29.051
What are we gonna do with him?

29:29.219 --> 29:31.342
- Raise him.
- Raise him?

29:31.513 --> 29:33.173
You got another suggestion?

29:33.348 --> 29:35.388
- But-
- It's dangerous out there for him.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.807
What about in here?
What, are we gonna study him?

29:37.978 --> 29:41.394
Your mind goes right to torture.
Don't assume that for everyone.

29:41.565 --> 29:43.273
What exactly are you trying to say?

29:43.442 --> 29:47.439
Sorry, I heard about
what you majored in, down in the pit.

29:47.654 --> 29:50.145
The hell is your problem, man?

29:50.866 --> 29:52.905
You're starting to become
a pain in my ass.

29:53.076 --> 29:55.746
Take it easy, man. He's my brother.

29:56.538 --> 29:58.994
We all done bristling up, or what?

29:59.207 --> 30:01.034
Nobody's doing anything to him,
Dean.

30:01.209 --> 30:03.582
When he's old enough,
we throw it to him.

30:03.754 --> 30:06.292
He wants to volunteer to help out,
that's fine.

30:08.091 --> 30:09.669
Could be great.

30:10.761 --> 30:12.504
- How?
- Think of the kind of hunter...

30:12.679 --> 30:14.802
he'll grow up to be.

30:17.934 --> 30:21.054
You all are joking, right?
I mean, come on.

30:21.229 --> 30:24.563
You can't Angelina Jolie
a Shapeshifter.

30:25.609 --> 30:27.566
Give me the baby.

30:28.403 --> 30:32.235
- Why can't you give me an inch of trust?
- You two are back from the dead...

30:32.407 --> 30:35.242
and I seem to be the only one
who wants to know how that happened.

30:35.410 --> 30:37.699
You're not the only one
who wants to know.

30:40.040 --> 30:43.041
There's too much mystery
with this family for me to get comfy.

30:43.210 --> 30:45.535
Then don't. But don't put it on us.

30:46.755 --> 30:48.913
All we're trying to do is invite you in.

30:49.549 --> 30:50.878
- Christian?
- Yeah.

30:51.051 --> 30:53.886
You and Arlene.
Still no luck on the baby front?

30:54.054 --> 30:57.886
Not yet, no. But you want one?

31:01.144 --> 31:02.852
- Yeah, we do.
- Wait. Hold on.

31:03.021 --> 31:05.014
It's okay, Dean. All right.

31:06.024 --> 31:07.353
Congrats.

31:07.526 --> 31:10.645
It's a boy. Sometimes.

31:10.821 --> 31:13.228
Ha, ha. The crap I do for this family.

31:13.407 --> 31:16.407
- You're kidding, right?
- Go to hell, Dean.

31:17.494 --> 31:20.246
Well, you have no business
raising anything.

31:20.414 --> 31:22.572
Why, Dean, because he's a hunter?

31:27.087 --> 31:28.996
Check the back door.

31:29.548 --> 31:33.130
Downstairs. Panic room.
He'll be safe there.

31:33.301 --> 31:36.137
Go. We got it. Go. Now.

32:00.203 --> 32:02.410
You have something of ours.

32:11.336 --> 32:14.088
I know he's here. I can feel him.

32:25.934 --> 32:27.476
- Run.
- No!

32:27.644 --> 32:29.388
Mark!

32:56.924 --> 32:58.334
Easy, tiger.

32:59.384 --> 33:02.469
Get the silver nets,
we're gonna box him up.

33:16.902 --> 33:20.485
Come on, Bobby John.
You have got to keep quiet.

33:22.783 --> 33:25.155
It does not sound good up there.

33:31.500 --> 33:34.169
All right. I'm going up.

33:34.336 --> 33:36.329
Stay with the baby.

34:04.616 --> 34:07.072
- What the-?
- Give me the baby.

34:07.244 --> 34:09.034
No way in hell.

35:04.217 --> 35:08.049
- I'm pretty sure it's not a myth now.
- Yeah.

35:08.263 --> 35:09.923
What the hell was that thing?

35:13.727 --> 35:15.720
We think it may have been an Alpha.

35:15.896 --> 35:19.146
- An Alpha. Like-?
- All monsters come from somewhere.

35:19.316 --> 35:20.596
You think this was the-?

35:20.776 --> 35:23.812
King Shapeshifter. First one
who spawned all the others.

35:23.987 --> 35:25.731
There's tons of lore about it.

35:25.906 --> 35:28.231
The first one?
That's why it was so strong.

35:28.450 --> 35:30.443
And why nothing we had stopped it.

35:30.619 --> 35:33.739
He said he could find the baby
anywhere, that he could feel it.

35:33.914 --> 35:36.666
Like there's a connection.
That's in the lore too.

35:36.833 --> 35:39.371
What the hell's it want
with babies anyway?

35:39.544 --> 35:41.288
Softball team?

35:41.463 --> 35:43.290
I got no clue.

35:43.924 --> 35:45.548
Great.

35:46.260 --> 35:48.252
Well, then, how do we kill it?

35:50.013 --> 35:51.342
I don't know if we can.

35:57.938 --> 36:00.511
- You know, it's funny.
- What's that?

36:00.691 --> 36:03.941
You know, just before you, uh, ganked
that Shifter in the motel...

36:04.111 --> 36:07.811
he mentioned a father, which makes
sense now because he meant the Alpha.

36:08.198 --> 36:11.781
- Huh. Yeah, I guess so.
- Did you hear him say that?

36:13.078 --> 36:14.620
Uh...

36:14.871 --> 36:19.165
I don't know, kind of a hot moment,
you know? Why?

36:20.085 --> 36:24.332
Oh, because if you heard him,
then you knew the Alpha was out there.

36:25.173 --> 36:27.332
- Okay.
- If you knew the Alpha was out there...

36:27.509 --> 36:29.798
then you knew he might come
after the baby...

36:29.970 --> 36:32.461
in which case,
you were using the baby as bait.

36:32.639 --> 36:34.347
So was that the plan...

36:34.516 --> 36:37.268
- to use the baby as bait?
- Of course not.

36:38.478 --> 36:41.479
Dean, I just thought
Samuel's was the safest place. That's all.

36:43.442 --> 36:45.399
Right. Of course.

37:02.622 --> 37:05.113
No, I didn't catch it.
It killed three of my people.

37:05.291 --> 37:08.043
I shot it full of elephant tranquilizer
and it chuckled.

37:09.212 --> 37:11.251
To be honest, I'm not sure
I wanna find it.

37:11.839 --> 37:14.330
But yeah,
we will find a way to catch it.

37:16.219 --> 37:19.884
Yeah, sure, I'll bring it right to you.
Giftwrapped.

37:24.977 --> 37:27.765
Hey. Hey. Where's Ben?

37:27.939 --> 37:29.682
Bike ride.

37:36.948 --> 37:38.490
What?

37:45.164 --> 37:47.453
I don't know what to do here, Lis.

37:49.335 --> 37:52.787
I mean, if I knew for sure what
the safest thing was, then I'd do it.

37:53.006 --> 37:56.540
Stay here and look after you guys...

37:56.718 --> 37:59.921
or get as far away
as I possibly can...

38:01.264 --> 38:02.758
but I don't know.

38:04.183 --> 38:06.010
And I get what I've been doing lately.

38:06.185 --> 38:12.058
You know, with the yelling
and the acting like a-

38:12.233 --> 38:15.269
Like a prison guard.
It's just-That's not me.

38:17.196 --> 38:20.316
You tell yourself you're not gonna
be something, you know?

38:20.491 --> 38:25.284
You know, my dad was exactly like this,
all the time...

38:27.999 --> 38:30.916
- and it's scaring the hell out of me.
- Dean.

38:35.465 --> 38:37.623
Can I be honest?

38:38.760 --> 38:41.001
Maybe we're safer with you here.

38:41.179 --> 38:44.761
Maybe gone. I don't know.

38:45.350 --> 38:47.638
The one thing that I do know is...

38:47.810 --> 38:50.017
that you're not
a construction worker.

38:50.605 --> 38:54.649
You're a hunter. And now you know your
brother's out there, things are different.

38:56.235 --> 38:58.477
- You don't wanna be here, Dean.
- Yes, I do.

39:01.783 --> 39:03.574
Okay.

39:04.077 --> 39:06.116
Okay. But you also wanna be there.

39:07.246 --> 39:08.906
I get it.

39:11.918 --> 39:15.287
You're white-knuckling it,
living like this.

39:16.047 --> 39:19.131
Like what you are
is some bad, awful thing.

39:19.509 --> 39:21.382
But you're not.

39:26.974 --> 39:30.806
But I'm not gonna have this discussion
every time you leave.

39:32.021 --> 39:36.233
And this is-
This is just gonna keep happening.

39:39.654 --> 39:40.982
So I need you to go.

39:45.284 --> 39:47.158
I can't just lose you and Ben.

39:47.370 --> 39:50.240
- That's not what I'm saying.

Just come in one piece, okay?

40:13.229 --> 40:16.313
