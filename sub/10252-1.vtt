WEBVTT

01:09.278 --> 01:12.238
Your son is arrived from London.

01:15.826 --> 01:17.535
Father.

01:17.995 --> 01:20.997
John. John.

01:22.291 --> 01:24.917
You will see in my will

01:25.085 --> 01:29.255
the estate of Norland
was left to me in such a way

01:29.423 --> 01:33.968
as prevents me from dividing it
between my two families.

01:34.136 --> 01:36.345
Calm yourself, Father,
this cannot be good for you.

01:36.513 --> 01:39.724
Norland, in its entirety,

01:39.892 --> 01:44.061
is therefore yours by law.

01:44.730 --> 01:50.276
And I am happy for you and Fanny.

01:51.737 --> 01:56.032
But your stepmother,
my wife and daughters,

01:56.200 --> 01:58.785
are left only 500 pounds a year.

01:58.952 --> 02:03.664
Barely enough to live on.
Nothing for the girls' dowries.

02:05.375 --> 02:08.586
You must help them.

02:09.963 --> 02:14.550
Of course.
You must promise to do this.

02:16.178 --> 02:18.513
I promise, Father.

02:19.181 --> 02:21.265
I promise.

02:22.059 --> 02:24.936
Help them? What do you mean?

02:25.395 --> 02:28.231
I mean to give them 3000 pounds.

02:28.398 --> 02:32.568
The interest will provide them
with a little extra income.

02:32.736 --> 02:36.113
The gift will fulfil my promise.

02:36.281 --> 02:39.575
Without question. More than amply.

02:39.743 --> 02:41.103
One had rather, on such occasions,

02:41.245 --> 02:44.288
do too much than too little.

02:46.375 --> 02:49.836
Of course, he did not stipulate
a particular sum.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.716
What do you say to 1500, then?

02:55.884 --> 03:01.430
What brother would be so kind to his
real sisters, let alone half-blood?

03:01.598 --> 03:03.140
They can hardly expect more.

03:03.308 --> 03:07.812
The question is, what can you afford?

03:11.108 --> 03:13.484
A hundred pounds a year
to their mother, while she lives,

03:13.652 --> 03:17.780
is better than losing 1500 at once.

03:17.948 --> 03:22.827
Should she live longer than 15 years
we'd be completely taken in.

03:24.162 --> 03:28.249
People live forever
when an annuity is to be paid them.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.962
Twenty pounds now and then
will amply discharge my promise,

03:33.130 --> 03:35.298
you're quite right.
Indeed.

03:35.716 --> 03:41.304
Although to say the truth, I'm convinced that
your father had no idea of giving them money.

03:41.471 --> 03:46.976
They will have 500 a year.
What more could they want for?

03:47.185 --> 03:48.825
Their housekeeping will be
nothing at all.

03:48.937 --> 03:53.107
They'll have no carriage, no horses, hardly
any servants, and will keep no company.

03:53.275 --> 03:55.651
Conceive how comfortable they will be!

03:56.570 --> 03:59.780
They will be much more able
to give you something.

04:22.471 --> 04:25.473
Marianne, can you play something else?

04:25.641 --> 04:28.851
Mama has been weeping since breakfast.

04:38.904 --> 04:41.656
I meant something less mournful.

04:43.951 --> 04:47.078
A visitor in my own home!

04:47.245 --> 04:50.081
It is not to be borne, Elinor.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.750
Mama, we have nowhere to go.

04:52.918 --> 04:55.711
John and Fanny will be here soon.

04:55.879 --> 04:59.799
Do you expect me to be here
to welcome them? Vultures!

05:13.480 --> 05:17.525
I will start making enquiries
for a new house at once.

05:19.361 --> 05:23.030
Until then, we must try
to bear their coming.

05:25.617 --> 05:28.244
Margaret, are you there?
Come down.

05:28.412 --> 05:31.247
John and Fanny will be here soon.

05:33.250 --> 05:37.920
Why are they to live at Norland?
They have a house in London.

05:38.088 --> 05:43.426
Houses go from father to son,
not father to daughter.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.678
It is the law.

05:46.972 --> 05:49.181
If you come,
we'll play with your atlas.

05:49.349 --> 05:53.185
It's not mine anymore,
it's their atlas.

05:59.401 --> 06:01.277
Do sit down.

06:02.571 --> 06:05.322
As you know,
we are looking for a new home,

06:05.490 --> 06:10.286
and can only retain Thomas and Betsy.

06:11.038 --> 06:14.206
We're sorry to have to leave you all.

06:14.374 --> 06:20.796
But we are certain you will find the
new Mrs. Dashwood a fair mistress.

06:21.631 --> 06:26.218
My only real concern is how
long it will take them to move out.

06:48.492 --> 06:49.825
How is Mrs. Ferrars?

06:51.244 --> 06:53.329
She is always in good health.

06:53.830 --> 06:58.334
My brother is with her this season.
Quite the most popular bachelor.

06:58.502 --> 06:59.835
He has his own barouche.

07:04.674 --> 07:06.592
You have two brothers?

07:06.760 --> 07:11.013
Yes. Edward is the elder.

07:11.181 --> 07:14.100
He's travelling up from Plymouth
and will break his journey here.

07:19.856 --> 07:22.191
If that is agreeable to you.

07:23.068 --> 07:25.277
My dear John,

07:25.695 --> 07:27.947
this is your home now.

07:31.493 --> 07:35.204
Fanny wants the key to the silver.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.957
What does Fanny want with it?

07:38.125 --> 07:41.377
One can only presume
she wants to count it.

07:41.545 --> 07:43.003
What are you doing?

07:43.171 --> 07:44.713
Gifts for the servants.

07:44.881 --> 07:50.094
Where is Margaret?
She's taken to hiding.

07:50.262 --> 07:54.223
At least she can escape Fanny.

07:54.391 --> 07:57.059
You do your best.
You've not said a word to her.

07:57.227 --> 08:01.564
I have. I've said yes and no.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.204
Good morning, Fanny.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.001
Good morning, Miss Marianne.

08:22.711 --> 08:25.880
How did you find the silver?
Was it all genuine?

08:26.047 --> 08:30.718
Pray, when may we expect your brother?

08:30.886 --> 08:33.179
Edward is due tomorrow.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.972
Oh, and my dear Mrs. Dashwood.

08:35.140 --> 08:37.349
In view of the fact
that he will not stay long,

08:37.517 --> 08:40.936
I wonder if Margaret
will give up her room for him?

08:41.104 --> 08:46.942
The view is incomparable, and I
want him to see Norland at its best.

09:09.591 --> 09:14.053
Mrs. Dashwood,
Miss Dashwood, Miss Marianne.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.805
My brother, Edward Ferrars.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.726
Do sit down.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.648
Where is Miss Margaret?

09:25.815 --> 09:29.485
I'm beginning to doubt
of her existence.

09:29.653 --> 09:35.658
Forgive us, Mr. Ferrars. My youngest
is shy of strangers at present.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.410
Naturally.

09:38.578 --> 09:43.415
I am shy of strangers myself,
and I have nothing like her excuse.

09:44.167 --> 09:46.377
How do you like your view,
Mr. Ferrars?

09:49.256 --> 09:51.423
Very much.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.843
Your stables are handsome
and beautifully kept.

09:55.011 --> 09:58.555
Stables?
Your windows overlook the lake.

09:59.182 --> 10:02.685
An oversight, Fanny, had led
me to one of the family rooms,

10:02.852 --> 10:05.062
but I've rectified the situation.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.356
I am happily installed
in the guest quarters.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.527
Tea!

10:13.488 --> 10:16.073
They're all spoilt, I find.

10:16.241 --> 10:19.827
Miss Margaret is always up trees
and under furniture.

10:19.995 --> 10:23.330
I've barely had a civil word
from Marianne.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.875
My dear Fanny,
they've just lost their father.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.753
Their lives will never be the same.

10:30.547 --> 10:33.257
That is no excuse.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.387
Library.

10:41.808 --> 10:44.059
These are mostly foreign.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.229
Indeed. Magnificent.

10:47.397 --> 10:49.315
I've never liked the smell of books.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.233
Oh.

10:51.401 --> 10:54.862
No, it is the dust, perhaps.

10:55.030 --> 10:57.197
I hear you have great plans
for the walnut grove.

10:57.365 --> 11:01.243
Oh, yes. I shall have it knocked down
to make way for a Grecian temple.

11:01.411 --> 11:04.496
Oh!
Oh! That does sound interesting.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.707
Would you show me the site?

11:13.673 --> 11:15.883
Too expensive.

11:16.051 --> 11:19.553
And we do not need four bedrooms.
We can share.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.222
This one, then.

11:22.390 --> 11:26.226
We have only 500 a year.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.479
I'll send out more enquiries today.

11:33.735 --> 11:36.236
Pardon my intrusion,

11:36.404 --> 11:40.616
but I think I have found
what you were looking for.

11:41.785 --> 11:43.410
Oh.

11:49.834 --> 11:54.129
Won't you come out?
We haven't seen you all day.

11:54.297 --> 11:57.299
We'll have to enlarge it.

11:58.009 --> 12:01.178
Mattocks will help you adjust
to our hours.

12:03.973 --> 12:06.934
Oh, Miss Dashwood.

12:07.102 --> 12:12.773
Forgive me, do you by any chance
have a reliable atlas?

12:12.941 --> 12:18.070
I believe so.
I must check the Nile's position.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.239
My sister tells me
it is in South America.

12:23.034 --> 12:24.618
Oh.

12:24.786 --> 12:26.328
No.

12:26.496 --> 12:29.581
No, she's quite wrong.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.376
I believe it is in Belgium.

12:32.544 --> 12:34.086
Belgium?

12:34.254 --> 12:37.506
Surely not.
You must be thinking of the Volga.

12:37.674 --> 12:40.342
The Volga?
Of course, the Volga,

12:40.510 --> 12:43.720
which, as you know, starts in...
Vladivostok, and ends in...

12:43.888 --> 12:45.222
Wimbledon.
Precisely.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.933
Where coffee beans come from.
Ugh!

12:48.101 --> 12:51.854
The source of the Nile
is in Abyssinia.

12:52.647 --> 12:54.231
Is it?

12:55.400 --> 12:56.608
Interesting.

12:56.776 --> 13:00.362
How do you do? Edward Ferrars.
Margaret Dashwood.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.698
Delighted to meet you.

13:02.866 --> 13:04.616
It adjoins this property.
Quite so.

13:04.784 --> 13:08.036
It cannot be
but a most desirable addition.

13:08.204 --> 13:10.038
I'll ride there tomorrow
and speak to...

13:10.206 --> 13:11.415
Who is it?

13:11.583 --> 13:13.625
- Gibson.
- Gibson.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.044
He'll be pleased enough to sell.

13:16.212 --> 13:19.923
He'll want more than it is worth.

13:37.358 --> 13:39.026
Lunge.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.871
Ah!

13:51.039 --> 13:53.749
Have I hurt you?
No, no.

14:55.645 --> 14:58.647
Thank you. Forgive me.

15:00.066 --> 15:03.235
That was my father's favourite.

15:07.156 --> 15:11.994
Thank you for helping Margaret.
She's changed since you came.

15:12.161 --> 15:15.163
Not at all, not at all.
I enjoy her company.

15:15.331 --> 15:19.501
Has she shown you the tree house?
Not yet.

15:19.669 --> 15:23.922
Would you do me the honour,
Miss Dashwood?

15:25.925 --> 15:29.595
It is very fine out.
With pleasure.

15:31.431 --> 15:34.057
Margaret always wanted to travel.

15:34.225 --> 15:36.602
I know. She's off to China soon.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.186
I'm to go as her servant.

15:38.354 --> 15:42.024
But only on the understanding
that I'll be very badly treated.

15:43.026 --> 15:45.068
What will your duties be?

15:45.236 --> 15:49.489
Sword fighting and swabbing.

15:49.657 --> 15:52.409
Which will take precedence?

15:52.577 --> 15:54.286
Swabbing, I would imagine.

16:01.794 --> 16:06.632
All I have ever wanted
is the quiet of a private life.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.839
But my mother is determined
to see me distinguished.

16:08.885 --> 16:11.720
As?
Anything.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.723
Orator. Politician.

16:14.891 --> 16:19.227
Even a barrister would do,
if I drove a barouche.

16:19.395 --> 16:21.355
What do you wish for?

16:22.899 --> 16:27.235
I prefer the church, but that is not
smart enough for my mother.

16:27.445 --> 16:32.157
She prefers the army,
but that is too smart for me.

16:32.325 --> 16:35.369
Would you stay in London?
I hate London.

16:35.536 --> 16:41.708
Country living is my ideal. A small
parish where I might do some good.

16:41.876 --> 16:46.046
Keep chickens.
Give very short sermons.

16:50.802 --> 16:52.928
You talk of feeling idle and useless.

16:53.888 --> 16:56.765
Imagine how that is compounded
when one has no hope

16:56.933 --> 17:00.769
and no choice of
any occupation whatsoever.

17:02.438 --> 17:05.147
Our circumstances are therefore
precisely the same.

17:06.818 --> 17:10.112
Except that you will inherit
your fortune.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.782
We cannot even earn ours.

17:16.618 --> 17:19.037
Perhaps Margaret is right.
Right?

17:19.204 --> 17:21.164
Piracy is our only option.

17:24.252 --> 17:26.627
What is swabbing exactly?

17:28.464 --> 17:32.384
"No voice divine the storm allayed.
No light propitious shone.

17:32.552 --> 17:37.180
When snatched from all effectual
aid, we perished, each alone.

17:38.391 --> 17:43.520
But I, beneath a rougher sea, and
whelmed in deeper gulfs than he..."

17:44.147 --> 17:45.480
No, Edward, listen.

17:46.149 --> 17:51.027
"No voice divine the storm allayed.
No light propitious shone.

17:51.195 --> 17:55.449
When snatched from all effectual
aid, we perished, each alone."

17:55.616 --> 17:57.868
Can you not feel his despair?

17:59.704 --> 18:00.704
Try again.

18:05.960 --> 18:12.174
"No voice divine the storm allayed.
No light propitious shone.

18:12.592 --> 18:18.013
When snatched from all effectual
aid, we perished, each alone."

18:20.850 --> 18:22.350
Mama.

18:25.688 --> 18:29.566
Look. This has just arrived.

18:30.735 --> 18:35.947
"I should be pleased to offer you a home at
Barton Cottage, as soon as ever you have need..."

18:36.115 --> 18:38.200
It's from my cousin,
Sir John Middleton.

18:38.367 --> 18:40.494
Even Elinor must approve the rent.

18:40.661 --> 18:42.037
Has she not yet seen this?

18:42.205 --> 18:45.040
No. I will fetch her.
Wait, no.

18:45.208 --> 18:46.792
Let us delay.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.293
Why?

18:48.461 --> 18:49.836
I think...

18:50.004 --> 18:54.549
I believe that Edward and Elinor
have formed an attachment.

18:54.717 --> 18:59.221
It would be cruel to take her away
so soon. Devonshire is so far.

19:00.014 --> 19:03.225
Why so grave?
Do you disapprove her choice?

19:03.392 --> 19:05.560
By no means.

19:05.728 --> 19:10.565
Edward is very amiable.
Amiable? But?

19:10.733 --> 19:13.151
There is something wanting.

19:13.319 --> 19:16.321
He is too sedate.
His reading last night...

19:16.489 --> 19:19.908
Elinor has not your feelings.
His reserve suits her.

19:20.076 --> 19:21.827
Can he love her?

19:21.994 --> 19:26.414
Can the soul be satisfied
with polite affections?

19:26.582 --> 19:31.419
To love is to be on fire.
Like Juliet, Guinevere, Heloise.

19:31.587 --> 19:36.091
They made rather pathetic ends.
Pathetic? To die for love?

19:36.259 --> 19:39.302
How can you say so?
What could be more glorious?

19:39.470 --> 19:42.597
I think that may be taking
your romantic sensibilities a little far.

19:49.272 --> 19:52.524
"Is love a fancy or a feeling?

19:52.692 --> 19:56.444
No, it is immortal
as immaculate truth.

19:56.654 --> 20:00.782
'Tis not a blossom shed
when youth drops from life's stem.

20:00.950 --> 20:04.286
For it will grow in barren regions
where no waters flow,

20:04.453 --> 20:08.039
nor ray of promise
cheats the pensive gloom."

20:08.624 --> 20:10.125
Hm?

20:11.335 --> 20:13.753
What a pity Edward has
no passion for reading.

20:13.921 --> 20:16.965
You asked him to read,
then you made him nervous.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.842
Me?
Yes.

20:20.636 --> 20:26.975
Your behaviour is cordial.
You like him in spite of his deficiencies.

20:27.727 --> 20:33.982
I think him everything
that is amiable and worthy.

20:34.984 --> 20:37.360
Praise, indeed.

20:37.820 --> 20:42.949
He shall have my devotion when
you tell me he is to be my brother.

20:43.117 --> 20:45.827
How shall I do without you?

20:45.995 --> 20:47.579
Without me?

20:47.747 --> 20:52.250
I'm sure you will be very happy,
but promise you won't live far away.

20:52.418 --> 20:55.629
Marianne, there is no question of...
That is, there is...

20:55.796 --> 20:58.006
There is no understanding.

20:58.174 --> 21:00.216
Do you love him?

21:03.179 --> 21:07.307
I do not deny that I think
very highly of him.

21:07.475 --> 21:09.434
That I...

21:10.645 --> 21:13.521
greatly esteem him.

21:14.190 --> 21:17.609
I like him.
Esteem? Like?

21:17.777 --> 21:20.403
Use these words again
and I shall leave the room!

21:20.571 --> 21:22.781
Very well. Forgive me.

21:22.949 --> 21:28.286
Believe my feelings to be stronger.
Further than that, do not believe.

21:30.665 --> 21:33.708
Is love a fancy or a feeling?

21:33.876 --> 21:37.671
Or a Ferrars?
Go to bed.

21:39.298 --> 21:43.677
"I do not deny that I think
very highly of him.

21:44.637 --> 21:48.473
That I greatly esteem him.

21:50.559 --> 21:53.228
That I like him."

22:12.415 --> 22:16.918
We are so happy
that you invited Edward to Norland.

22:17.086 --> 22:20.505
He's a dear boy.
We're all very fond of him.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.632
We have great hopes for him.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.467
Much is expected of him by our mother

22:24.635 --> 22:25.885
with regard to his profession.

22:26.053 --> 22:27.387
Naturally.

22:27.555 --> 22:28.930
And in marriage.

22:29.098 --> 22:31.766
She's determined both he
and Robert will marry well.

22:31.934 --> 22:33.560
Of course.

22:33.728 --> 22:36.604
But I hope she desires them
to marry for love.

22:37.898 --> 22:40.275
Love is all very well,

22:40.443 --> 22:45.030
but the heart doesn't always lead us
in the most suitable direction.

22:46.240 --> 22:50.952
Edward is a compassionate person.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.621
Penniless women prey on that type.

22:54.165 --> 22:56.583
And having entered into
any understanding,

22:56.751 --> 22:58.293
he would never go back on his word.

22:58.461 --> 23:01.129
He is simply incapable of doing so.

23:01.505 --> 23:03.965
But it would lead to his ruin.

23:04.800 --> 23:10.430
I'm worried. Mother will withdraw
all financial support from him

23:10.598 --> 23:16.478
should he plant affection in less
exalted ground than he deserves.

23:18.898 --> 23:21.483
I understand you perfectly.

23:26.655 --> 23:28.406
To Devonshire?

23:28.574 --> 23:31.993
My cousin, Sir John Middleton,
has offered us a small house.

23:32.161 --> 23:34.120
Sir John Middleton?

23:34.288 --> 23:37.415
He must be a man of property.

23:37.583 --> 23:43.004
He's a widower from Barton Park.
It is Barton Cottage he offers us.

23:43.172 --> 23:47.050
Oh, a cottage? How charming.
A cottage is always very snug.

23:48.135 --> 23:49.636
But...

23:50.179 --> 23:52.138
You will not leave before the summer?

23:52.306 --> 23:57.102
We can no longer trespass
upon your sister's goodwill.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.771
You will come and stay with us.

24:00.314 --> 24:01.689
I should like that.

24:01.857 --> 24:05.235
Edward has long been expected
by our mother.

24:06.195 --> 24:07.862
Come as soon as you can, Edward.

24:08.864 --> 24:11.908
Remember, you're always welcome.

24:38.185 --> 24:39.727
Can't you take him with you?

24:39.895 --> 24:42.730
We can't afford him.

24:44.400 --> 24:47.610
Perhaps he could
make himself useful in the kitchen.

24:48.612 --> 24:49.821
Forgive me.

24:53.826 --> 24:56.369
Miss Dashwood...

24:58.581 --> 25:00.498
Elinor...

25:01.959 --> 25:03.501
I must speak to you.

25:08.048 --> 25:12.093
There is something of
great importance that I need to...

25:13.846 --> 25:19.309
tell you about my education.

25:23.105 --> 25:24.606
Your education?

25:25.107 --> 25:26.858
Yes.

25:27.276 --> 25:33.031
It was conducted,
oddly enough, in Plymouth.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.034
Indeed?
Yes.

25:36.202 --> 25:37.660
Do you know it?
Plymouth?

25:37.828 --> 25:38.828
Yes.
No.

25:38.996 --> 25:41.456
Oh. Well...

25:42.541 --> 25:44.959
I was four years there.

25:46.086 --> 25:49.631
In a school run by Mr. Pratt.

25:53.510 --> 25:56.179
Pratt?
Precisely. Pratt.

25:56.347 --> 25:58.598
And, uh...

25:58.766 --> 26:00.892
While I was there...

26:01.852 --> 26:03.811
That is to say, he had a...

26:03.979 --> 26:06.231
- Has a...
- Edward!

26:06.649 --> 26:08.107
Edward.

26:09.318 --> 26:13.071
I've been all over for you.
You're needed in London this instant.

26:13.656 --> 26:14.989
I'm leaving this afternoon.

26:15.157 --> 26:18.826
That will not do.
Mama wishes you to leave at once.

26:22.831 --> 26:24.749
Excuse me.

26:56.115 --> 26:59.325
Edward promised
he would bring the atlas to Barton.

26:59.493 --> 27:01.077
Did he?

27:02.037 --> 27:04.914
I'll wager he will do so
in less than a fortnight.

27:06.583 --> 27:08.584
Dear Edward.

27:29.773 --> 27:33.318
- Hello there!
- Mrs. Dashwood!

27:33.485 --> 27:35.862
Whoa. Yes.

27:39.408 --> 27:41.242
Sir John.

27:49.793 --> 27:55.256
Dear ladies!
Upon my word! Here you are!

27:55.716 --> 28:01.346
Sir John, your kindness...
None of that! Hush, please!

28:01.513 --> 28:05.433
Here is my dear mama-in-law,
Mrs. Jennings.

28:05.601 --> 28:09.103
Now get down, dog!
This must be Mrs. Dashwood.

28:09.271 --> 28:11.606
Was your journey tolerable?
Poor souls!

28:11.774 --> 28:15.276
Why did you not
come up to the park first?

28:15.444 --> 28:20.448
We saw you pass.
I made John call the carriage.

28:20.616 --> 28:25.119
She would not wait.
We have so little company.

28:25.287 --> 28:28.289
Oh, I feel as if I know you already.

28:28.457 --> 28:31.125
Delightful creatures!
Are they not.

28:31.293 --> 28:35.129
- You'll dine at Barton Park daily.
- Oh, every day.

28:35.297 --> 28:36.464
Dear Sir John, we cannot...

28:36.632 --> 28:38.049
No, no, no.

28:38.217 --> 28:42.637
No refusals! I'm quite deaf to them.

28:42.805 --> 28:44.305
But I insist!

28:44.473 --> 28:47.475
Let us only settle in a few days.
But thank you very much.

28:47.643 --> 28:49.477
No, no, no thanks.

29:13.502 --> 29:18.214
Send your man up for the carriage
as soon as you're ready. Goodbye.

29:18.382 --> 29:21.300
- Thank you.
- Don't thank us.

29:21.468 --> 29:22.552
Good day to you.

29:42.197 --> 29:44.490
Your feet are cold.

30:10.559 --> 30:11.893
What have you been doing?

30:12.060 --> 30:14.395
Your neck is so dirty
you could grow potatoes on it.

30:15.314 --> 30:18.232
It's cold. I'm cold.

30:19.193 --> 30:21.569
Hot.
Thank you, Elinor.

30:22.571 --> 30:24.155
It's hot.

30:29.328 --> 30:33.915
Where can Brandon be?
I hope he's not lamed his horse.

30:34.082 --> 30:37.960
Colonel Brandon is the most
eligible bachelor in the county.

30:38.128 --> 30:39.128
Oh, indeed.

30:39.296 --> 30:44.175
He is bound to go for one of you.
He's a better age for Miss Dashwood.

30:45.511 --> 30:49.263
But I dare say she's left her heart
behind in Sussex.

30:50.349 --> 30:55.645
I see you, Miss Marianne!
I think I've unearthed a secret.

30:55.812 --> 30:58.606
You've sniffed them out already.
You're worse than my best pointer.

31:01.276 --> 31:06.197
Is he a butcher, baker,
candlestick maker?

31:06.365 --> 31:07.406
I'll winkle it out of you.

31:07.783 --> 31:09.951
She's good at winkling.

31:10.118 --> 31:14.163
We've none of us any secrets here.

31:14.331 --> 31:16.290
Or if we do, we do not keep them long.

31:19.461 --> 31:23.506
He's curate of the parish.
Or perhaps a handsome lieutenant.

31:23.966 --> 31:26.676
Give us a clue. Is he in uniform?

31:26.843 --> 31:28.844
- He has no profession.
- Oh.

31:29.388 --> 31:32.348
No profession? He's a gentleman?

31:32.808 --> 31:36.811
Margaret, you know perfectly well
there is no such person.

31:36.979 --> 31:40.147
There is. His name begins with F.

31:40.315 --> 31:41.607
Margaret.
Oh.

31:41.775 --> 31:45.027
An F? There's a promising letter.

31:45.195 --> 31:47.321
F? F?
Foster?

31:47.489 --> 31:52.159
There's one.
Forrest? Fotheringay? Featherty?

31:52.327 --> 31:54.704
Fortescue?
Fondant?

31:56.164 --> 32:00.543
Sir John,
might I play your pianoforte?

32:01.795 --> 32:03.462
Yes, of course.

32:03.839 --> 32:05.214
My goodness.

32:05.382 --> 32:09.010
We don't stand on ceremony here.

32:09.177 --> 32:10.386
Please forgive her...

32:10.554 --> 32:13.139
An entertainment, I declare.

32:13.307 --> 32:15.766
I cannot remember when we last
had a songbird in the house.

33:34.638 --> 33:38.099
Lovely, love... Brandon!

33:38.266 --> 33:41.102
Come and meet our beautiful
new neighbours.

33:41.269 --> 33:47.274
What a pity you're late.
You have not heard our songbird.

33:47.818 --> 33:49.777
A great pity.

33:49.945 --> 33:54.824
This is my dear friend Colonel Brandon.
We served in the East Indies.

33:54.991 --> 33:57.785
Not a better fellow in the world.

33:57.953 --> 34:00.204
You've been to the East Indies?

34:00.372 --> 34:02.707
I have.
What's it like?

34:02.874 --> 34:04.959
Like? Hot.

34:05.627 --> 34:09.045
The air is full of spices.

34:10.674 --> 34:14.176
Now, Miss Dashwood,
it's your turn to entertain us.

34:14.344 --> 34:15.469
Oh, no

34:15.637 --> 34:20.306
And I believe I know
what key you will sing in.

34:20.516 --> 34:22.143
F-major...

34:36.366 --> 34:39.702
You have no right to parade
your ignorant assumptions...

34:39.870 --> 34:42.163
They're not assumptions.
You told me.

34:44.081 --> 34:45.833
I told you nothing.

34:46.001 --> 34:47.668
They'll meet him when he comes.

34:47.835 --> 34:51.297
You don't speak of such things
before strangers.

34:51.465 --> 34:55.050
Everyone else was.
Mrs. Jennings is not "everyone."

34:55.217 --> 35:00.181
I like her. She talks about things.
We never talk about things.

35:00.348 --> 35:03.726
Hush, please.
That is enough, Margaret.

35:03.894 --> 35:08.355
If you can say nothing appropriate,
limit your remarks to the weather.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.862
Surely they have enough reeds
for a Moses basket.

35:15.030 --> 35:17.072
Mama, we've got lots.

35:54.027 --> 35:56.403
You know what they're saying?

35:56.863 --> 36:02.201
Hm? Word is, you've developed
a taste for certain company.

36:02.369 --> 36:06.330
And why not, say I?
A man like you in his prime.

36:06.498 --> 36:09.375
She'd be a fortunate young lady.

36:09.543 --> 36:13.212
Marianne Dashwood would
no more think of me than of you.

36:13.380 --> 36:16.215
Don't think of yourself so meanly.

36:16.383 --> 36:19.093
And all the better for her.

36:43.118 --> 36:44.702
Oh, no.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.328
Oh.

36:47.247 --> 36:49.248
Besotted.

36:49.416 --> 36:50.916
An excellent match.

36:51.084 --> 36:53.294
He's rich and she's handsome.

36:54.296 --> 36:55.629
How long have you known him?

36:55.797 --> 37:01.468
As long as I've been here,
and I came 15 years back.

37:01.636 --> 37:06.473
His estate is but four miles hence.
He and John are very thick.

37:06.892 --> 37:11.687
He has no wife and children.
He had a tragic history.

37:12.689 --> 37:15.691
He loved a girl once.
Twenty years ago now.

37:15.859 --> 37:18.819
A ward to his family.
They were not permitted to marry.

37:19.487 --> 37:22.489
On what grounds?
Money. Eliza was poor.

37:22.866 --> 37:24.825
When the father discovered
their amour,

37:24.993 --> 37:28.203
she was flung out of the house,
and he was packed off to the army.

37:28.371 --> 37:31.248
I think he'd have done himself harm
if not for John.

37:32.834 --> 37:34.627
What became of the lady?

37:34.794 --> 37:38.339
She was passed from man to man.

37:38.506 --> 37:40.674
Disappeared from good society.

37:41.676 --> 37:45.846
When Brandon returned from India
he searched heaven knows how long,

37:46.014 --> 37:49.266
only to find her dying in a poorhouse.

37:49.643 --> 37:52.811
Once, I thought my daughter Charlotte
might have cheered him up.

37:52.979 --> 37:55.689
But she's better off where she is.

37:55.857 --> 38:01.070
But look at him now! So attentive!

38:03.573 --> 38:08.744
I should try a little experiment.
Oh, no. Please, let the colonel alone.

38:08.912 --> 38:12.706
No, no, no, my dear.
All suitors need a little help.

38:13.833 --> 38:17.628
Colonel Brandon,
we haven't heard you play of late.

38:17.796 --> 38:21.131
There's a simple reason, my dear.
You have a superior musician here.

38:21.299 --> 38:25.427
Our dear Brandon shares
your passion for music.

38:25.595 --> 38:29.098
He plays the pianoforte well.

38:29.265 --> 38:35.062
Oh, come, you know as many
melancholy tunes as Miss Marianne.

38:35.897 --> 38:41.068
You must play us a duet.
Let us see you both side by side.

38:41.236 --> 38:43.612
I do not know any duets.

38:44.030 --> 38:45.823
Forgive me, colonel.

38:52.080 --> 38:58.210
Will we never have peace? The rent
is low, but it comes on hard terms.

38:58.378 --> 39:03.590
Mrs. Jennings has nothing to do but
marry off everyone else's daughters.

39:03.758 --> 39:06.427
There's a parcel arrived.

39:06.594 --> 39:08.095
Parcel?
Look!

39:08.263 --> 39:09.304
Oh, my goodness.

39:12.058 --> 39:17.438
It is too ridiculous. When is a man safe from
such wit, if infirmity does not protect him?

39:17.605 --> 39:19.565
Infirmity?
If Brandon is infirm,

39:19.733 --> 39:20.816
then I am at death's door.

39:20.984 --> 39:22.864
It is a miracle your life
has extended this far.

39:23.028 --> 39:28.824
He complained of rheumatism.
"A slight ache" was his phrase.

39:34.164 --> 39:37.916
But Edward said
he would bring it himself.

39:39.753 --> 39:43.505
"Dear Mrs. Dashwood, Miss Dashwood,
Miss Marianne and Captain Margaret.

39:43.673 --> 39:47.301
It gives me great pleasure to
restore this atlas to its owner.

39:47.469 --> 39:53.807
Business prevents my delivering it,
which will hurt me more than you.

39:53.975 --> 39:58.270
Memories of your kindness
must sustain me, and I remain

39:58.438 --> 40:02.608
your devoted servant always,
E.C. Ferrars."

40:02.776 --> 40:06.695
Why hasn't he come?
He says he's busy, dear.

40:06.863 --> 40:08.906
He said he'd come.

40:09.074 --> 40:10.449
Why hasn't he come?

40:10.617 --> 40:11.867
I'm taking you for a walk.

40:12.035 --> 40:13.827
No, I've been a walk.
You need another.

40:13.995 --> 40:16.121
It is going to rain.
It is not going to rain.

40:16.289 --> 40:20.167
You always say that
and then it always does.

40:20.752 --> 40:24.338
I fear Mrs. Jennings
is a bad influence.

40:31.346 --> 40:33.722
You must miss him, Elinor.

40:34.516 --> 40:37.017
We are not engaged, Mama.

40:37.977 --> 40:41.438
But he loves you, dearest.

40:41.606 --> 40:44.108
I am by no means assured of that.

40:44.275 --> 40:46.360
And had he such a preference,

40:46.528 --> 40:50.531
we should be foolish to assume
there would not be many obstacles

40:50.698 --> 40:55.119
to his marrying a woman of no rank
who cannot afford to buy sugar.

40:55.286 --> 41:00.707
But your heart must tell you...
It is better to use one's head.

41:10.176 --> 41:14.680
It can't be good for me.
It is. Stop complaining.

41:14.848 --> 41:18.058
It's giving me a cough.
It is not giving you a cough.

41:18.268 --> 41:19.768
Please, can we go back?

41:19.936 --> 41:23.897
It's lovely. Come on, catch up!

41:25.108 --> 41:28.318
Over there is a field of rabbits.

41:28.486 --> 41:31.363
I don't want to see rabbits.
Yes, you do.

41:36.411 --> 41:41.665
Ah, is anything superior to this?
I told you it would rain.

41:41.833 --> 41:44.293
There's blue sky! Let us chase it!

41:44.460 --> 41:46.253
I'm not supposed to run.

41:49.465 --> 41:50.924
Ah!
Marianne!

41:52.385 --> 41:55.304
Are you hurt?
Agh!

41:57.432 --> 42:01.518
I cannot walk. Run and fetch help.

42:01.686 --> 42:04.521
I will run as fast as I can.

42:14.199 --> 42:18.285
Margaret!

42:24.626 --> 42:27.961
Don't be afraid. He's quite safe.

42:32.508 --> 42:35.302
Are you hurt?
Only my ankle.

42:36.804 --> 42:39.640
May I have your permission to
ascertain if there are any breaks?

43:00.161 --> 43:02.162
It is not broken.

43:02.497 --> 43:06.583
Now, can you put your arm
about my neck?

43:09.754 --> 43:12.506
Allow me to escort you home.

43:17.470 --> 43:19.179
At last!

43:19.847 --> 43:22.683
She fell down and he's carrying her!

43:22.850 --> 43:24.184
What?

43:25.687 --> 43:28.563
Marianne, are you hurt?

43:28.731 --> 43:32.317
It's a twisted ankle.
Do not be alarmed, Mama.

43:32.485 --> 43:36.488
It's not serious.
I felt the bone, and it's sound.

43:36.656 --> 43:38.824
I cannot begin to thank you.

43:38.992 --> 43:42.035
Do not think of it.
I'm honoured to be of service.

43:42.203 --> 43:46.415
Will you not be seated?
I don't desire to leave a water mark.

43:46.958 --> 43:50.419
But permit me to call tomorrow
and enquire after the patient.

43:50.837 --> 43:52.713
We shall look forward to it.

43:53.131 --> 43:55.173
You're most kind.
I'll show you out.

43:55.341 --> 43:56.925
Thank you.

43:57.135 --> 44:00.053
Margaret, get the gentleman's hat.

44:00.221 --> 44:01.722
Thank you.

44:02.890 --> 44:05.600
His name, his name!
His name.

44:05.768 --> 44:08.562
Shh.
To whom are we so much obliged?

44:08.730 --> 44:11.523
John Willoughby
of Allenham at your service.

44:12.400 --> 44:14.818
John Willoughby of Allenham.

44:17.613 --> 44:20.240
What an impressive gentleman!

44:20.867 --> 44:23.285
He lifted me as if I weighed no more
than a dried leaf.

44:23.453 --> 44:25.245
Is he human?

44:26.414 --> 44:30.208
Tell me if I hurt you.
She feels no pain, Mama.

44:30.918 --> 44:33.920
Margaret, ask Betsy to make up
a cold compress.

44:34.088 --> 44:37.174
Quickly as you can.
Please don't say anything important.

44:37.342 --> 44:38.592
Go on, go on.

44:38.760 --> 44:41.928
He expressed himself well, did he not?

44:42.096 --> 44:45.390
With decorum and honour.
And spirit and wit and feeling.

44:45.558 --> 44:48.602
And economy. Ten words at most.
Oh, Elinor.

44:48.770 --> 44:52.356
And he is to come tomorrow.
Change, or you'll catch a cold.

44:52.523 --> 44:54.107
What care I for colds?

44:54.275 --> 44:58.945
You'll care when your nose swells.
You're right. Help me.

45:01.866 --> 45:07.454
He's worth catching. Marianne must
not have all the men to herself.

45:07.622 --> 45:09.873
But what do you know of him?

45:10.792 --> 45:14.419
Decent shot.
There's not a bolder rider.

45:14.587 --> 45:16.963
But what is he like?
Like?

45:17.131 --> 45:19.674
But what are his tastes,
his passions, his pursuits?

45:21.386 --> 45:22.928
Well...

45:23.554 --> 45:28.141
He has a smart little pointer.
Was she out with him?

45:28.309 --> 45:30.977
Where is Allenham?
Allenham?

45:31.145 --> 45:35.816
Nice little estate three miles east.
He is to inherit it from a relative.

45:35.983 --> 45:38.485
Lady Allen is the name.

45:44.784 --> 45:48.495
It's Colonel Brandon.
I should go out and keep watch.

45:50.248 --> 45:51.540
Hello, colonel.

45:51.707 --> 45:57.254
You're looking out for Willoughby.
You'll not think of Brandon now.

45:57.839 --> 45:59.548
Come in.

46:01.592 --> 46:03.510
- Colonel.
- Good morning, Brandon.

46:03.678 --> 46:05.262
Good morning.

46:05.430 --> 46:07.222
How is the invalid?

46:07.390 --> 46:09.850
Oh, thank you so much, colonel.

46:10.017 --> 46:11.143
Elinor, would you?

46:11.310 --> 46:14.521
I cannot think why you should
set your cap at Willoughby

46:14.689 --> 46:18.024
when you've already made
such a splendid conquest?

46:18.234 --> 46:21.528
I've no intention
of setting my cap at anyone.

46:21.863 --> 46:24.072
Lady Allen's nephew?

46:24.240 --> 46:26.616
He visits every year,
for he's to inherit.

46:28.202 --> 46:32.080
He has a pretty estate of his own.

46:32.248 --> 46:35.167
Combe Magna in Somerset.

46:35.334 --> 46:40.589
I'd not give him up to a younger
sister for tumbling down hills.

46:40.756 --> 46:42.382
Marianne!

46:42.884 --> 46:47.012
Don't run.
The man himself. Come, Brandon.

46:47.180 --> 46:51.558
We know when we are not wanted.
Let us leave him to the ladies.

46:52.310 --> 46:53.935
Thank you so much for calling.

46:56.481 --> 46:59.733
Marianne, the colonel and Sir John
are leaving.

46:59.901 --> 47:03.236
Goodbye, Sir John.
Colonel, thank you for the flowers.

47:14.707 --> 47:15.707
How do you do, colonel?

47:15.875 --> 47:18.293
How does he do?
How do you do, more like.

47:18.461 --> 47:20.962
Go on in, they're waiting for you.

47:21.130 --> 47:22.589
Come.

47:32.934 --> 47:34.100
Stop it.

47:37.772 --> 47:44.110
Mr. Willoughby, what a pleasure!
The pleasure is all mine.

47:44.278 --> 47:46.488
Miss Marianne has not caught cold?

47:46.948 --> 47:49.491
You've found out my name.
But of course.

47:49.659 --> 47:52.285
The area is crawling with my spies.

47:52.453 --> 47:55.288
And since you cannot
venture out to nature,

47:55.456 --> 47:56.831
nature must be brought to you.

47:57.792 --> 48:00.252
Oh, how beautiful.

48:00.419 --> 48:01.836
These are not from the hothouse.

48:03.798 --> 48:07.509
I see mine is not the first offering.
Nor the most elegant.

48:07.677 --> 48:10.637
I'm afraid I obtained those
from an obliging field.

48:10.805 --> 48:14.891
I always prefer wild flowers.
I suspected as much.

48:15.059 --> 48:16.810
Elinor, would you?
Oh, yes. Excuse me.

48:16.978 --> 48:19.312
Our gratitude is beyond words.

48:19.480 --> 48:20.647
But it is I who am grateful.

48:20.815 --> 48:23.692
I've often passed this cottage
and grieved for its lonely state.

48:23.859 --> 48:27.654
Then I heard it was taken.

48:27.822 --> 48:32.909
I felt an interest which nothing can
account for but my present delight.

48:33.077 --> 48:35.078
Oh, Elinor, put them here.

48:35.246 --> 48:36.496
Pray sit, Mr. Willoughby.

48:37.290 --> 48:39.207
Ah, who is reading
Shakespeare's sonnets?

48:39.417 --> 48:41.418
Marianne.
I am.

48:43.629 --> 48:47.090
Marianne is reading them out.
And which are your favourites?

48:47.258 --> 48:50.719
Oh...
Without a doubt, mine is 116.

48:50.886 --> 48:54.681
"Let me not to the marriage
of true minds admit impediments."

48:54.849 --> 48:58.602
"Love is not love which alters
when it alteration finds,

48:58.769 --> 49:02.188
or bends with the remover
to remove..."

49:03.024 --> 49:04.357
How does it continue?

49:04.900 --> 49:05.900
"Oh, no,

49:06.068 --> 49:08.028
It is an ever fixed mark

49:08.195 --> 49:10.447
that looks on storm..."
that looks on tempests..."

49:10.615 --> 49:13.867
Is it "tempests"?
I do believe it is "tempests."

49:14.035 --> 49:15.785
Let me find it.

49:15.953 --> 49:17.996
It's strange you are reading these.

49:18.164 --> 49:22.626
I carry them with me always.
Oh, how beautiful.

49:31.344 --> 49:33.553
Until tomorrow then.

49:37.725 --> 49:42.729
My pocket sonnets are yours.
A talisman against further injury.

49:42.938 --> 49:45.732
Goodbye. Thank you.

49:51.405 --> 49:54.032
Good work, Marianne.

49:54.200 --> 49:57.786
You covered Shakespeare, Scott,
all forms of poetry.

49:57.953 --> 50:00.891
Another meeting, we'll ascertain his views
on nature and romantic attachments,

50:00.915 --> 50:04.334
and then you'll have nothing left to
talk of and the relationship will end.

50:04.502 --> 50:10.340
I suppose I erred against decorum.
I should have talked of the weather.

50:10.508 --> 50:14.928
No, but Mr. Willoughby can be in
no doubt of your enthusiasm for him.

50:15.096 --> 50:18.098
Why should he doubt it?
Should I hide my regard?

50:18.265 --> 50:21.893
No particular reason, only
that we know so little of him.

50:22.061 --> 50:24.396
Time does not determine intimacy.

50:24.563 --> 50:29.567
Seven years is too little for some,
seven days is enough for others.

50:29.735 --> 50:31.486
Or seven hours, in this case.

50:31.654 --> 50:34.447
I feel I know him already.

50:34.615 --> 50:37.951
Had I more shallow feelings, I could
perhaps conceal them as you do.

50:38.119 --> 50:41.788
Marianne, that is not fair.
I'm sorry, Elinor. I did not mean...

50:41.956 --> 50:44.040
Don't trouble yourself, Marianne.

50:48.462 --> 50:50.922
I do not understand her.

51:19.577 --> 51:21.494
Marianne.

51:24.832 --> 51:29.335
Haven't you finished yet?
No. Patience.

51:41.223 --> 51:44.684
You're not going to deny us
beef as well as sugar?

51:44.852 --> 51:48.354
There is nothing under 10 pence.

51:48.522 --> 51:49.856
Do you want us to starve?

51:50.065 --> 51:54.110
No. Just not to eat beef.

52:36.904 --> 52:41.241
If my behaviour was improper,
I should be sensible of it.

52:41.408 --> 52:47.413
It has caused impertinent remarks.
Do you not doubt your discretion?

52:48.457 --> 52:53.586
If Mrs. Jennings' remarks prove
impropriety, we are all offending.

52:53.754 --> 52:55.797
Morning.

52:55.965 --> 52:58.049
Good morning, colonel.

52:59.510 --> 53:05.849
Miss Dashwood, Miss Marianne,
I come to issue an invitation.

53:09.228 --> 53:12.605
A picnic on my estate at Delaford.

53:12.773 --> 53:16.776
If you would care to join us
on Thursday next.

53:18.237 --> 53:22.115
Mrs. Jennings' daughter and husband
are travelling up especially.

53:25.244 --> 53:27.287
We should be delighted, colonel.

53:29.248 --> 53:32.458
I will, of course, be including
Mr. Willoughby in the party.

53:34.295 --> 53:36.629
I should be delighted to join you.

53:42.469 --> 53:45.096
Good morning, Miss Dashwood.
Good morning, colonel.

53:45.264 --> 53:48.641
Good morning, Mr. Willoughby.
The colonel has invited us to Delaford.

53:48.809 --> 53:49.809
Excellent.

53:49.977 --> 53:53.146
I hear you have a fine pianoforte.

53:53.314 --> 53:55.648
A Broadwood Grand.
A Broadwood Grand?

53:55.816 --> 53:59.277
Then I shall play for you all.
We shall look forward to it.

53:59.445 --> 54:02.238
Good day. Walk on, walk on.

54:02.823 --> 54:04.532
Goodbye.

54:14.501 --> 54:16.502
Your sister seems very happy.

54:16.670 --> 54:18.338
Yes.

54:18.505 --> 54:21.925
She does not approve
of hiding her emotions.

54:22.843 --> 54:27.722
Her romantic prejudices
tend to set propriety at nought.

54:28.682 --> 54:33.478
She is wholly unspoilt.
Rather too unspoilt, in my view.

54:33.646 --> 54:37.774
The sooner she is acquainted with
the ways of the world, the better.

54:42.738 --> 54:44.864
I knew a lady very like your sister.

54:45.032 --> 54:47.742
The same impulsive
sweetness of temper,

54:47.910 --> 54:53.623
who was forced into, as you put it,
a better acquaintance with the world.

54:53.791 --> 54:58.211
The result was only
ruination and despair.

54:59.797 --> 55:02.966
Do not desire it, Miss Dashwood.

55:06.011 --> 55:09.055
Colonel Brandon's lawn
is perfect for kite launching.

55:09.223 --> 55:13.893
We must test your sky kite.
Mind the pretty ribbons.

55:16.563 --> 55:21.651
Imagine my surprise when Charlotte
and her master appeared with Lucy.

55:21.819 --> 55:24.696
The last person I expected to see.

55:24.863 --> 55:29.909
She came to join in the fun.
There is no such luxury at home.

55:30.077 --> 55:33.746
I'd not seen you for so long.
I couldn't resist the opportunity.

55:33.914 --> 55:38.167
You sly thing! It was the Dashwoods
she wanted to see.

55:38.836 --> 55:42.964
I've heard nothing but "Dashwood"
for I don't know how long.

55:43.132 --> 55:45.216
What do you think of them
now you see them?

55:45.384 --> 55:49.095
My mother wrote of little else
in her letters since you came.

55:49.722 --> 55:52.974
Are they not as she describes?
Nothing like.

55:53.142 --> 55:56.728
Oh!
You are quite rude today.

55:56.895 --> 56:00.148
He's to be an MP,
and it is very fatiguing for him,

56:00.315 --> 56:03.109
for he is forced
to make everybody like him.

56:03.277 --> 56:04.861
I said nothing so irrational.

56:05.571 --> 56:09.282
Mr. Palmer's so droll.
He's always out of humour.

56:09.450 --> 56:13.661
Oh! Here he comes!
Now you shall see, Charlotte.

56:20.961 --> 56:23.588
Hello, Mr. Willoughby!

56:23.756 --> 56:27.008
You must meet my daughter,
Charlotte, and Mr. Palmer.

56:27.468 --> 56:31.471
How do you do?
And our cousin, Miss Lucy Steele.

56:31.972 --> 56:34.474
Welcome to our party.

56:34.641 --> 56:37.393
Turn about.
Come round, boys, come round.

56:40.647 --> 56:43.816
May I sit beside you?

56:44.318 --> 56:48.154
I've longed to meet you. I've heard
nothing but praise of you.

56:49.073 --> 56:51.491
I would be delighted.

56:51.658 --> 56:54.258
Sir John and Mrs. Jennings are
too excessive in their compliments.

56:54.328 --> 56:55.995
Oh, no.
I am sure to disappoint.

56:56.163 --> 56:59.040
The praise came from another source.

56:59.208 --> 57:01.667
One not inclined to exaggeration.

57:02.878 --> 57:05.129
What can this be?

57:15.974 --> 57:17.809
- Colonel Brandon here?
- Over here.

57:17.976 --> 57:19.352
There he is.

57:27.945 --> 57:31.239
My horse!
What's the matter?

57:31.406 --> 57:34.242
I must away to London.
Impossible!

57:34.409 --> 57:35.535
Imperative.

57:35.702 --> 57:41.374
We can't picnic without our host.
Come up to town tomorrow.

57:41.542 --> 57:44.418
Or wait until we return.

57:44.586 --> 57:48.297
I can't afford to lose one minute.

57:48.465 --> 57:51.843
Forgive me.
I hope it's nothing serious.

57:53.804 --> 57:57.640
Upon my soul,
this is all very unusual.

57:59.726 --> 58:03.229
Frailty, thy name is Brandon.

58:03.397 --> 58:06.107
Some cannot bear pleasure.

58:06.775 --> 58:10.695
You are a wicked pair.
Colonel Brandon will be missed.

58:10.863 --> 58:12.280
Why?

58:12.656 --> 58:17.076
Everyone speaks well of him,
but no one remembers to talk to him.

58:17.244 --> 58:18.578
- Exactly.
- Nonsense.

58:18.745 --> 58:21.622
He is highly respected at Barton Park.

58:21.790 --> 58:24.834
Which is enough censure in itself.
Really, Willoughby.

58:27.087 --> 58:31.757
Come, come, Mr.
Impudence. I know your wicked ways.

58:31.925 --> 58:34.760
Reveal your beau.
Reveal him, I say.

58:34.928 --> 58:38.598
No secrets between friends.
I'll winkle them out of you.

58:38.765 --> 58:45.021
I'll have you married to the colonel
by tea, or I'll swallow my bonnet.

58:46.815 --> 58:48.316
As if you could marry him.

58:49.359 --> 58:51.277
Why should you dislike him?

58:52.779 --> 58:55.990
Because he threatened me with rain
when I wanted it fine.

58:57.409 --> 59:02.830
He found fault with my high flyer
and will not buy my brown mare.

59:02.998 --> 59:06.334
Oh!
If it will be of satisfaction to you,

59:06.501 --> 59:10.296
I believe his character to be,
in all other respects, irreproachable,

59:10.464 --> 59:12.298
then I'm ready to confess it.

59:12.466 --> 59:18.512
In return for this acknowledgement,
don't deny me the privilege

59:18.680 --> 59:22.308
of disliking him as much as I adore...

59:27.314 --> 59:29.315
this cottage.

59:30.901 --> 59:33.653
I have plans for improvements.

59:34.279 --> 59:36.739
Now, that I will never consent to.

59:38.116 --> 59:39.909
Not a stone must be added
to its walls.

59:41.828 --> 59:47.083
Were I rich enough, I'd rebuild
Combe Magna to this exact image.

59:47.251 --> 59:49.377
With dark, narrow stairs,
a pokey hall,

59:49.544 --> 59:51.337
and a fire that smokes, I suppose?

59:52.089 --> 59:53.965
Especially the fire that smokes.

59:55.133 --> 59:57.510
Then I'd be as happy at Combe
as I've been at Barton.

59:59.346 --> 01:00:02.932
But this place has one claim on
my affections none other can share.

01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:08.145
Promise never to change it.

01:00:13.652 --> 01:00:17.154
I'm honoured you risk your honour

01:00:17.322 --> 01:00:20.491
by seeing me to
the gate unaccompanied.

01:00:20.659 --> 01:00:23.160
That is what Elinor would say.

01:00:23.328 --> 01:00:25.496
And she would be right.

01:00:26.331 --> 01:00:30.042
Miss Marianne, will you grant me
an interview tomorrow?

01:00:30.419 --> 01:00:31.836
Alone?

01:00:32.337 --> 01:00:36.215
Willoughby, we are always alone.
But there is...

01:00:36.717 --> 01:00:39.427
There is something very particular
I should like to ask you.

01:00:41.305 --> 01:00:43.264
Of course.

01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:47.310
I shall ask Mama
if I may stay behind from church.

01:00:48.729 --> 01:00:50.479
Thank you.

01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:54.150
Until tomorrow, then.

01:00:57.154 --> 01:00:58.863
Miss Marianne.

01:01:09.458 --> 01:01:11.417
Oh, Virtue.

01:01:11.626 --> 01:01:17.757
Silently and with fear, enter the
hearts of all that hear me this day.

01:01:17.924 --> 01:01:19.633
Will he kneel down when he asks her?

01:01:19.801 --> 01:01:22.094
Shh.

01:01:22.262 --> 01:01:24.597
They always kneel down.

01:01:39.112 --> 01:01:41.655
What is wrong, dearest?

01:01:42.407 --> 01:01:45.951
Willoughby? What is the matter?

01:01:46.119 --> 01:01:48.037
I am s...

01:01:48.205 --> 01:01:50.539
Forgive me, Mrs. Dashwood.

01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:52.333
I am sent...

01:01:52.501 --> 01:01:57.922
Lady Allen exercised the privilege
of riches upon a dependent cousin

01:01:58.090 --> 01:02:00.049
and is sending me to London.

01:02:00.467 --> 01:02:03.886
This morning?
Almost this moment.

01:02:04.054 --> 01:02:08.891
What a disappointment. Your business
won't detain you for long, I hope?

01:02:09.935 --> 01:02:15.523
You are kind, but I have no idea of
returning immediately to Devonshire.

01:02:16.316 --> 01:02:18.859
I am invited only once a year.

01:02:19.027 --> 01:02:22.321
For shame, Willoughby.
Can you wait for our invitation?

01:02:24.241 --> 01:02:27.159
My engagements at present
are of such a nature...

01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:31.330
I dare not flatter my...

01:02:32.499 --> 01:02:36.585
It's folly to linger in this manner.
I will not torment myself further.

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:40.089
Willoughby, come back!

01:02:40.924 --> 01:02:45.261
Margaret, ask Betsy
to make a cup of tea for Marianne.

01:02:45.429 --> 01:02:49.098
What is wrong, my love?
Do not ask me questions.

01:02:49.266 --> 01:02:52.268
Please, let me be.

01:02:57.899 --> 01:02:59.859
They must have quarrelled.

01:03:00.026 --> 01:03:02.027
That is unlikely.

01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:08.534
Perhaps Lady Allen disapproves
of his regard for Marianne.

01:03:08.743 --> 01:03:10.703
And has invented an excuse
to send him away.

01:03:10.871 --> 01:03:13.706
Then why did he not say so?

01:03:13.874 --> 01:03:16.625
It's not like him to be secretive.

01:03:17.043 --> 01:03:18.377
What do you suspect?

01:03:18.545 --> 01:03:21.839
Why was his manner so guilty?

01:03:22.007 --> 01:03:26.135
You think he's been acting a part?

01:03:26.303 --> 01:03:28.053
No. He loves her. I am sure.

01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:29.221
Of course!

01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:34.977
Has he left her any assurance
of his return?

01:03:35.145 --> 01:03:37.855
Cannot you ask if he proposed.

01:03:38.023 --> 01:03:43.235
No! I cannot force a confidence
from Marianne. Nor should you.

01:03:43.403 --> 01:03:47.239
We must trust her to confide in us
in her own time.

01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:52.328
There was something underhand
in his manner.

01:03:52.496 --> 01:03:54.140
You are resolved
to think the worst of him.

01:03:54.164 --> 01:03:55.206
I'm not resolved.

01:03:55.373 --> 01:03:59.043
I prefer give him the benefit of my
good opinion. He deserves no less.

01:03:59.211 --> 01:04:01.253
From all of us.

01:04:01.421 --> 01:04:04.423
I am very fond of Willoughby.

01:04:04.591 --> 01:04:07.927
Mama. Mama!

01:04:12.682 --> 01:04:15.226
She would not let me in.

01:04:58.478 --> 01:04:59.937
Oh!

01:05:00.647 --> 01:05:03.816
Oh, if only this rain would stop.

01:05:03.984 --> 01:05:05.484
If only you would stop.

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:12.283
'Twas you took her off my hands,
Mr. Palmer. A good bargain too.

01:05:12.450 --> 01:05:18.455
Now I have the whip hand over you,
for you cannot give her back.

01:05:20.375 --> 01:05:25.671
Marianne, play with us. Looking at
the weather will not bring him back.

01:05:25.839 --> 01:05:30.217
She ate nothing at dinner.
We're all forlorn these days.

01:05:32.887 --> 01:05:38.350
Dear Miss Dashwood, perhaps now
we might have our discussion.

01:05:38.518 --> 01:05:40.394
Our discussion?

01:05:40.562 --> 01:05:43.522
I've longed to ask you something.

01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:45.691
You might think me impertinent.

01:05:45.859 --> 01:05:48.110
I cannot imagine so.
It is an odd question.

01:05:48.278 --> 01:05:49.672
Forgive me,
I've no wish to trouble you.

01:05:49.696 --> 01:05:51.905
- No, no.
- Miss Dashwood,

01:05:52.073 --> 01:05:55.576
if only he'd gone to Combe Magna,
we could have taken you to see him.

01:05:55.744 --> 01:05:57.369
We live but half a mile away.

01:05:57.537 --> 01:06:00.247
Five and a half.
No.

01:06:00.415 --> 01:06:04.293
I cannot believe it is that far.
Is it really five and a half...

01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:06.086
I can't believe it.

01:06:06.671 --> 01:06:08.797
Try.

01:06:09.841 --> 01:06:13.636
You may ask any manner of
question, if that is of any help.

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:15.262
Thank you.

01:06:16.139 --> 01:06:22.186
Are you acquainted with your
sister-in-law's mother Mrs. Ferrars?

01:06:22.354 --> 01:06:24.980
With Fanny's mother?

01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:28.567
No, I have never met her.

01:06:28.735 --> 01:06:31.528
You must think me strange to ask.

01:06:32.197 --> 01:06:34.698
If only I dared tell...

01:06:35.241 --> 01:06:41.330
Lucy, if she tells you of the famous
Mr. F, you must pass it on.

01:06:43.249 --> 01:06:45.668
Will you take a turn with me,
Miss Dashwood?

01:06:45.919 --> 01:06:47.878
Oh, certainly.

01:06:51.091 --> 01:06:56.261
I had no idea you were at all
connected with that family.

01:06:56.471 --> 01:07:00.974
Oh, I am nothing to Mrs. Ferrars
at present.

01:07:01.434 --> 01:07:03.769
But the time may come

01:07:03.937 --> 01:07:08.565
when we may be very
intimately connected.

01:07:08.733 --> 01:07:10.693
What do you mean?

01:07:14.322 --> 01:07:18.450
Do you have an understanding
with Fanny's brother Robert?

01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:21.245
The youngest? No.

01:07:21.413 --> 01:07:23.330
I never met him in my life.

01:07:23.498 --> 01:07:26.291
No. With Edward.

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:30.462
Edward? Edward Ferrars?

01:07:31.631 --> 01:07:36.343
Edward and I have been
secretly engaged these five years.

01:07:40.473 --> 01:07:41.807
You may well be surprised.

01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:48.147
I only mention it because I entirely
trust you to keep our secret.

01:07:48.314 --> 01:07:50.023
Edward would not mind my telling you.

01:07:50.775 --> 01:07:53.485
For he looks on you
quite as his own sister.

01:07:56.197 --> 01:07:57.948
I am sorry.

01:07:58.867 --> 01:08:00.826
Surely we...

01:08:00.994 --> 01:08:05.914
We surely do not mean
the same Mr. Ferrars.

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:12.504
Yes. He was under the tutelage
of my uncle, Mr. Pratt, in Plymouth.

01:08:12.672 --> 01:08:14.757
Has he never spoken of it?

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:18.551
Yes. Yes, I believe he has.

01:08:21.264 --> 01:08:24.933
I wanted his mother's approval,

01:08:25.643 --> 01:08:28.145
but we loved each other so much.

01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:32.357
Though you do not know him
as well as I, Miss Dashwood,

01:08:32.524 --> 01:08:34.902
you must have seen how capable he is

01:08:35.069 --> 01:08:37.779
of making a woman attached to him.

01:08:40.073 --> 01:08:44.036
I cannot pretend it has not
been hard on us both.

01:08:44.203 --> 01:08:48.040
We can scarcely meet
above twice a year.

01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:01.053
You seem out of sorts.
Are you quite well?

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:02.554
Perfectly well, thank you.

01:09:03.096 --> 01:09:05.557
I have not offended you?
On the contrary.

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:09.060
I must know what you are saying.

01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:13.064
If anyone finds out, it will ruin him.
Promise me you'll not tell a soul.

01:09:13.233 --> 01:09:16.484
Miss Dashwood is quite engrossed.

01:09:18.238 --> 01:09:20.029
I give you my word.

01:09:20.198 --> 01:09:24.576
What has so fascinated you?

01:09:24.743 --> 01:09:25.911
Tell us all!

01:09:26.078 --> 01:09:30.082
We were talking of London.

01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:33.210
Do you hear that, Charlotte?

01:09:33.377 --> 01:09:36.755
Charlotte and I concocted a plan.

01:09:36.923 --> 01:09:38.799
The best plan in the world!

01:09:38.966 --> 01:09:43.511
I make for London shortly,
and I invite you, Lucy,

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:46.682
and both the Misses Dashwood,
to join me.

01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:49.142
Splendid idea.
London?

01:09:51.395 --> 01:09:54.231
Can I go?
You know you're too young.

01:09:54.399 --> 01:10:00.529
You will all come to my Chelsea home
and taste of the season's delights.

01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:03.323
Please, can I go? I'm 12 soon.

01:10:03.491 --> 01:10:07.494
Do you not long for it to be so?

01:10:07.662 --> 01:10:10.622
I came here with no other view.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.502
You're kind,
but we can't leave our mother.

01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:19.506
- She can spare you very well.
- Of course I can.

01:10:19.674 --> 01:10:24.636
Of course she can!
I could not be more delighted.

01:10:24.804 --> 01:10:30.183
I will brook no refusal.
Let us strike hands on the bargain.

01:10:30.351 --> 01:10:36.815
If I don't have you married by
Michaelmas, it will not be my fault.

01:10:44.699 --> 01:10:48.285
I've never been so grateful.

01:10:48.453 --> 01:10:53.832
I shall see Willoughby,
and you will see Edward.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.918
Are you asleep?

01:10:57.211 --> 01:10:59.338
With you in the room?

01:11:00.214 --> 01:11:04.885
You can't feel as calm as you look.

01:11:05.053 --> 01:11:07.846
Oh, I will never sleep tonight.

01:11:08.014 --> 01:11:11.642
What were you and Miss Steele
talking about so long?

01:11:12.644 --> 01:11:15.520
Nothing of significance.

01:11:33.331 --> 01:11:39.753
How do you think I like poking about
in that big house without Charlotte?

01:11:41.673 --> 01:11:46.718
I wrote to Edward, yet I do not know
how much I may see of him.

01:11:46.886 --> 01:11:50.013
Secrecy is vital.
He'll never be able to call.

01:11:50.181 --> 01:11:52.557
I should imagine not.

01:11:52.725 --> 01:11:57.521
It's so hard. My only comfort has
been the constancy of his affection.

01:11:57.689 --> 01:12:00.399
You're fortunate,
over such a lengthy engagement,

01:12:00.566 --> 01:12:02.567
never to have had
any doubts on that score.

01:12:02.777 --> 01:12:06.029
Oh, I am of a jealous nature.

01:12:06.197 --> 01:12:09.950
Had he talked more of one
young woman than any other...

01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:13.829
But he's never given a moment's alarm
on that count.

01:12:15.206 --> 01:12:18.709
Imagine how glad he'll be
to learn that we are friends.

01:12:25.425 --> 01:12:28.343
Have you missed me, Pigeon?
Very much, ma'am.

01:12:28.511 --> 01:12:30.280
Eh, you always say so
and I never believe you.

01:12:30.304 --> 01:12:34.474
I trust everything is in order?
I suggest the ordering of coal.

01:12:34.642 --> 01:12:36.268
Don't talk to me of coals.

01:12:36.436 --> 01:12:40.605
There you are, Pooter.
Still alive, I see. Tea, Pigeon.

01:12:40.773 --> 01:12:41.940
Yes, ma'am.
Hello, my dears.

01:12:43.317 --> 01:12:48.071
Well, you do not waste any time.
Give it to Pigeon.

01:12:49.949 --> 01:12:52.325
Let us hope
they are definitely engaged.

01:12:52.493 --> 01:12:54.930
Mrs. Jennings says your sister will
buy her wedding clothes in town.

01:12:54.954 --> 01:12:58.081
Indeed, Miss Steele,
I know of no such plan.

01:12:59.876 --> 01:13:03.754
John and Fanny are in town.
We shall be forced to see them.

01:13:13.473 --> 01:13:15.807
I think it was for next door.

01:13:15.975 --> 01:13:17.350
Yes, you're right.

01:13:17.518 --> 01:13:20.812
Do sit down for two seconds.

01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:22.939
You're making me nervous.

01:13:29.238 --> 01:13:31.990
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.

01:13:33.868 --> 01:13:35.702
Shh.

01:13:39.373 --> 01:13:42.793
Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby.

01:13:43.294 --> 01:13:45.420
Indeed it is.

01:13:50.343 --> 01:13:51.885
Oh.

01:13:52.845 --> 01:13:54.721
Excuse me, colonel.

01:13:55.681 --> 01:13:58.016
Colonel.

01:14:00.061 --> 01:14:02.521
What a pleasure to see you.

01:14:03.231 --> 01:14:04.751
Have you been in London
all this while?

01:14:04.857 --> 01:14:07.359
Forgive me, Miss Dashwood.

01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:13.448
I have heard reports
through town that...

01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:19.454
Tell me once and for all:

01:14:20.123 --> 01:14:24.793
Is everything resolved between
your sister and Mr. Willoughby?

01:14:27.839 --> 01:14:33.218
Though neither one has informed me
of their understanding,

01:14:33.678 --> 01:14:37.222
I have no doubt
of their mutual affection.

01:14:39.392 --> 01:14:41.852
Thank you, Miss Dashwood.

01:14:43.813 --> 01:14:47.440
To your sister,
I wish all imaginable happiness.

01:14:48.734 --> 01:14:55.073
To Mr. Willoughby,
that he may endeavour to deserve her.

01:14:56.784 --> 01:14:58.076
What do you mean?

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.248
Forgive me, I...

01:15:07.628 --> 01:15:09.421
Forgive me.

01:15:21.684 --> 01:15:25.103
Where is dear Edward, John?

01:15:25.271 --> 01:15:28.273
And who is Edward?
Who, indeed.

01:15:28.441 --> 01:15:31.735
My brother. Mr. Edward Ferrars.

01:15:31.903 --> 01:15:36.823
Indeed. Is that Ferrars with an F?

01:15:42.246 --> 01:15:44.789
Are there any messages?
No.

01:15:44.957 --> 01:15:48.084
No messages at all? No cards?
None.

01:15:48.252 --> 01:15:53.632
You do not ask for your messages.
No, for I do not expect any.

01:15:53.799 --> 01:15:56.968
I have no...
Very little acquaintance in town.

01:16:14.237 --> 01:16:19.908
Not another word about the ham bone.
You and Cartwright sort it out.

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:22.035
No messages.

01:16:22.203 --> 01:16:25.664
Do not fret, my dear.

01:16:25.831 --> 01:16:30.919
This good weather is keeping
many a sportsman in the country.

01:16:31.087 --> 01:16:35.423
But the frost will soon
drive them to town. Depend on it.

01:16:35.591 --> 01:16:38.218
Of course. I had not thought of that.

01:16:38.386 --> 01:16:40.595
Thank you, Mrs. Jennings.

01:16:40.763 --> 01:16:43.181
And Miss Dashwood
may set her heart at rest,

01:16:43.349 --> 01:16:49.145
for your sister-in-law is inviting
Mr. F to the ball tonight.

01:16:50.106 --> 01:16:54.276
Do be careful,
dears, the horses have been here.

01:16:55.611 --> 01:17:00.323
It is beginning to rain also.
Follow me.

01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:32.981
Oh, Mama!
This is very merry!

01:17:35.026 --> 01:17:39.487
Do you spy anyone we know?
No. Mr. Palmer has a better view.

01:17:39.655 --> 01:17:43.074
Mr. Palmer?
Do you see anyone we know?

01:17:43.242 --> 01:17:44.576
Unfortunately not.

01:17:44.744 --> 01:17:49.748
How can you be such a tease?
There is Mrs. John Dashwood.

01:17:49.915 --> 01:17:52.917
Mrs. Dashwood! Yoo-hoo!

01:17:54.045 --> 01:17:56.254
Come along, my dears.

01:17:59.925 --> 01:18:02.844
There you are!

01:18:03.012 --> 01:18:06.097
Oh, goodness. How hot it is.
Indeed.

01:18:06.265 --> 01:18:07.640
You are not alone, I trust?

01:18:07.808 --> 01:18:12.562
John is just gone to fetch my brother.

01:18:12.772 --> 01:18:19.027
Your brother! I declare,
this is good news, indeed.

01:18:19.195 --> 01:18:22.197
I shall faint clean away.

01:18:22.365 --> 01:18:24.366
Mrs. Jennings,
I am pleased to see you.

01:18:25.576 --> 01:18:29.871
May I present my brother-in-law,
Mr. Robert Ferrars.

01:18:31.957 --> 01:18:34.959
Miss Dashwood,
Miss Steele, Miss Marianne.

01:18:36.295 --> 01:18:40.215
My dear ladies, we meet at last.

01:18:42.009 --> 01:18:46.054
You must be the younger brother.
Is Mr. Edward not here?

01:18:46.222 --> 01:18:48.056
Miss Dashwood was counting on him.

01:18:48.224 --> 01:18:51.184
He is far too busy.

01:18:51.352 --> 01:18:55.146
There's no special acquaintance here
to make his attendance worthwhile.

01:18:57.483 --> 01:19:01.528
What are the men about these days?
Are they in hiding?

01:19:02.613 --> 01:19:08.243
In the absence of your brother, you
must dance with Miss Dashwood.

01:19:13.499 --> 01:19:16.418
It would be my honour.

01:19:21.674 --> 01:19:27.345
Perhaps Miss Steele might consider
reserving the allemande?

01:20:08.012 --> 01:20:11.639
You reside in Devonshire,
Miss Dashwood?

01:20:11.891 --> 01:20:13.057
Yes.

01:20:15.394 --> 01:20:19.481
In a cottage?
Yes.

01:20:20.608 --> 01:20:24.736
I am excessively fond of a cottage.

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:30.742
If I had any money to spare,
I should build one myself.

01:20:43.255 --> 01:20:44.631
Mr. Willoughby.

01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:49.636
How do you do, Miss Dashwood?
Very well.

01:20:49.803 --> 01:20:53.097
How is your family?
We are all extremely well.

01:20:56.143 --> 01:20:58.770
Thank you for your kind enquiry.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:03.691
Willoughby!

01:21:14.495 --> 01:21:16.120
Good God, Willoughby.

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:22.001
Will you not shake hands with me?

01:21:23.754 --> 01:21:25.463
How do you do, Miss Marianne?

01:21:29.134 --> 01:21:31.052
What is the matter?

01:21:31.804 --> 01:21:34.013
Why have you not come to see me?

01:21:35.182 --> 01:21:38.977
Were you not in London?
Have you not received my letters?

01:21:39.979 --> 01:21:43.982
I had the pleasure of receiving
the information you sent to me.

01:21:45.985 --> 01:21:50.655
For heaven's sake, Willoughby,
tell me what is wrong.

01:21:52.992 --> 01:21:55.326
Thank you. I am most obliged.

01:21:56.870 --> 01:22:00.039
Excuse me, I must rejoin my party.

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:25.064
Go to him, Elinor.
Force him to come to me instantly.

01:22:26.567 --> 01:22:28.359
You must come away.

01:22:32.031 --> 01:22:33.531
Do you know them?

01:22:34.199 --> 01:22:36.576
Acquaintances from the country.

01:22:38.495 --> 01:22:43.166
Indeed.
Wearing their country fashions, I see.

01:22:46.337 --> 01:22:48.254
Come away, dearest.

01:22:49.298 --> 01:22:50.506
Come away.

01:22:57.264 --> 01:22:59.891
I do not understand.
I must speak to him.

01:23:00.059 --> 01:23:01.851
There you are, my dear.

01:23:02.019 --> 01:23:07.106
My goodness. Come, dear.
You need some air.

01:23:19.578 --> 01:23:22.955
Lucy! Come, dear. We must go.

01:23:23.123 --> 01:23:24.290
Oh, we're leaving so soon?

01:23:24.458 --> 01:23:28.753
It would be our pleasure
to escort your young charge home.

01:23:28.921 --> 01:23:31.964
How very kind.
That is very handsome of you.

01:23:32.132 --> 01:23:34.258
She actually sent him messages
during the night?

01:23:34.426 --> 01:23:36.052
Yes, indeed.

01:23:48.107 --> 01:23:52.735
Marianne, please tell me.
Do not ask me questions.

01:23:52.903 --> 01:23:55.196
You have no confidence in me.

01:23:55.364 --> 01:24:00.159
This reproach from you?
You who confide in no one?

01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:06.833
I have nothing to tell.
We neither of us do.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.129
I, because I conceal nothing. You,
because you communicate nothing.

01:24:18.762 --> 01:24:24.225
Lady Charteris ought to limit
her invitation list. It was very warm.

01:24:24.393 --> 01:24:26.644
I am glad we left early.

01:24:28.397 --> 01:24:30.148
There now.

01:24:35.487 --> 01:24:41.701
Lovers' quarrels are swift to heal.
That letter will do the trick.

01:24:41.869 --> 01:24:43.661
I must be off.

01:24:44.079 --> 01:24:48.666
I do hope he doesn't
keep her waiting much longer.

01:24:48.834 --> 01:24:51.711
It hurts to see her this way.

01:24:54.173 --> 01:24:57.759
What a welcome I had
from Edward's family.

01:24:57.926 --> 01:25:01.596
You never said how agreeable
your sister-in-law is.

01:25:01.764 --> 01:25:04.474
Robert, also.

01:25:04.683 --> 01:25:09.604
It is fortunate that none of them
knows of your engagement.

01:25:18.906 --> 01:25:20.782
"Dear Madam,

01:25:20.949 --> 01:25:26.037
I am at a loss to see
how I might have offended you.

01:25:26.205 --> 01:25:32.043
If I have given rise to a belief of
more than I meant to express,

01:25:32.211 --> 01:25:35.922
I shall reproach myself
for not having been more guarded.

01:25:36.089 --> 01:25:39.091
My affections are engaged elsewhere.

01:25:39.259 --> 01:25:45.139
It is with regret that I return
your letters and the lock of hair.

01:25:45.307 --> 01:25:47.475
I am, et cetera, John Willoughby."

01:25:47.643 --> 01:25:49.852
Oh, Marianne.

01:25:52.314 --> 01:25:54.398
Dearest...

01:25:57.194 --> 01:25:59.570
It is best to know
what his intentions are at once.

01:25:59.738 --> 01:26:04.826
Think about if your engagement
had carried on before he ended it.

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:07.245
We're not engaged.

01:26:07.996 --> 01:26:12.875
I thought he left you
with some kind of understanding.

01:26:13.043 --> 01:26:14.418
No.

01:26:14.586 --> 01:26:16.254
He's not so unworthy as you think.

01:26:16.421 --> 01:26:20.132
Did he tell you that he loved you?

01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:22.093
Yes.

01:26:22.928 --> 01:26:24.428
No.

01:26:24.596 --> 01:26:26.180
Never absolutely.

01:26:26.348 --> 01:26:29.016
It was implied but never declared.

01:26:29.184 --> 01:26:34.272
Sometimes I thought it had been,
but it never was. He broke no vow.

01:26:34.439 --> 01:26:39.068
He made us all believe he loved you.

01:26:39.278 --> 01:26:45.116
He did! He loved me as I loved him.

01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:52.957
I had to come straight up.
How are you, Miss Marianne?

01:26:53.125 --> 01:26:57.962
Poor thing, she looks very bad.
No wonder, for it is but too true.

01:26:58.130 --> 01:27:01.674
I was told by Miss Morton,
a very great friend,

01:27:01.842 --> 01:27:06.512
that he is soon to marry
a Miss Grey with 50,000!

01:27:07.472 --> 01:27:13.227
If true, he is a good-for-nothing
who used my young friend ill.

01:27:13.395 --> 01:27:18.816
And I wish with all my soul that his
wife might plague his heart out.

01:27:19.359 --> 01:27:23.863
He's not the only young man
worth having.

01:27:24.031 --> 01:27:28.367
With your pretty face
you'll never want for admirers.

01:27:31.455 --> 01:27:34.498
Better let her have her cry out
and have done with it.

01:27:36.668 --> 01:27:40.671
I will go look out something
to tempt her.

01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:43.007
Does she care for olives?

01:27:44.968 --> 01:27:46.761
I cannot tell you.

01:27:54.186 --> 01:27:57.146
Apparently, they never were engaged.

01:27:57.356 --> 01:28:01.776
Miss Grey has 50,000 pounds.
Marianne is virtually penniless.

01:28:01.944 --> 01:28:04.737
She couldn't expect him
to go through with it.

01:28:04.905 --> 01:28:06.906
But I feel for her.

01:28:07.074 --> 01:28:10.868
She will lose her bloom
and end a spinster like Elinor.

01:28:12.371 --> 01:28:18.584
We might have them to stay for a
few days. We are, after all, family.

01:28:18.752 --> 01:28:21.212
And my father...
My love,

01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:27.259
I would ask them with all my heart,
but I've already asked Miss Steele.

01:28:27.427 --> 01:28:31.222
And we cannot deprive
Mrs. Jennings of all her company.

01:28:31.765 --> 01:28:34.976
We can invite your sisters
some other year.

01:28:35.143 --> 01:28:38.771
Miss Steele will profit more
from your generosity.

01:28:39.481 --> 01:28:40.481
Poor girl.

01:28:40.649 --> 01:28:42.775
Excellent notion.

01:28:47.614 --> 01:28:50.032
Colonel Brandon to see you.

01:28:50.784 --> 01:28:52.326
Colonel.

01:28:53.245 --> 01:28:56.080
Thank you so much for coming.

01:28:56.707 --> 01:28:58.124
How is your sister?

01:28:58.291 --> 01:29:00.584
I must get her home.

01:29:01.461 --> 01:29:05.423
Palmer can take us to Cleveland,
a day from Barton.

01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:09.176
I'll take you to Barton myself.

01:29:09.344 --> 01:29:13.097
I confess, that is what I hoped.

01:29:14.182 --> 01:29:17.018
Marianne suffers cruelly.

01:29:17.686 --> 01:29:22.023
What pains me most is how hard
she tries to justify Mr. Willoughby.

01:29:22.190 --> 01:29:24.942
But you know her disposition.

01:29:28.405 --> 01:29:30.364
Perhaps...

01:29:30.699 --> 01:29:32.867
I...

01:29:33.285 --> 01:29:39.206
May I relate some circumstances
which only a desire to be useful...

01:29:39.374 --> 01:29:42.126
You have something to tell me
of Mr. Willoughby?

01:29:53.055 --> 01:29:55.890
When I quitted Barton last...

01:29:57.017 --> 01:29:59.560
No, I must go further back.

01:30:01.021 --> 01:30:03.314
No doubt...

01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:05.816
No doubt,

01:30:05.984 --> 01:30:10.613
Mrs. Jennings has apprised you
of certain events in my past.

01:30:10.781 --> 01:30:14.617
The sad outcome of my connection
with a young woman named Eliza.

01:30:19.164 --> 01:30:22.166
What is not commonly known

01:30:23.001 --> 01:30:28.380
is that 20 years ago, before she died,
Eliza bore an illegitimate child.

01:30:29.341 --> 01:30:32.343
The father, whoever he was,
abandoned them.

01:30:33.637 --> 01:30:39.767
As Eliza lay dying, she begged me
to look after the child.

01:30:40.227 --> 01:30:44.855
I had failed her in every other way,
I could not refuse her now.

01:30:45.565 --> 01:30:50.778
I placed the child, Beth,
with a family in the country,

01:30:50.946 --> 01:30:55.574
where I knew she would be looked
after. I saw her whenever I could.

01:30:56.493 --> 01:30:59.995
She grew up so headstrong,

01:31:00.163 --> 01:31:05.543
and, God forgive me,
I allowed her too much freedom.

01:31:06.753 --> 01:31:10.089
Almost a year ago she disappeared.
Disappeared?

01:31:10.257 --> 01:31:14.969
I instigated a search, but for
eight months I imagined the worst.

01:31:15.137 --> 01:31:20.850
On the day of the Delaford picnic,
I received the first news of her.

01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:25.896
She was with child.

01:31:26.857 --> 01:31:32.444
And the blackguard who had left her
with no hint of his whereabouts...

01:31:33.572 --> 01:31:35.197
Oh, good God.

01:31:38.577 --> 01:31:40.411
Do you mean Willoughby?

01:31:44.708 --> 01:31:50.379
Before I could confront him,
Lady Allen had turned him out.

01:31:50.589 --> 01:31:55.301
He fled to London.
He left without any explanation.

01:31:55.468 --> 01:31:58.470
Lady Allen had annulled his legacy.
He was left with next to nothing.

01:31:58.638 --> 01:32:02.975
He risked losing the estate, and the
money that remained, to his debtors.

01:32:04.227 --> 01:32:06.854
So he abandoned Marianne...

01:32:07.606 --> 01:32:10.024
for Miss Grey and her 50,000.

01:32:14.613 --> 01:32:17.239
Is Beth still in town?

01:32:17.866 --> 01:32:22.161
She has chosen to go to the country
for her confinement.

01:32:29.169 --> 01:32:33.631
I would not burden you,
had I not, from my heart,

01:32:33.798 --> 01:32:39.470
believed it might, in time,
lessen your sister's regrets.

01:32:49.522 --> 01:32:54.944
I have described Mr. Willoughby
as the worst of libertines.

01:32:55.654 --> 01:33:01.242
But I learned from Lady Allen that he
did mean to propose that day and...

01:33:02.452 --> 01:33:05.537
I cannot deny that his intentions
towards Marianne

01:33:06.206 --> 01:33:09.083
were honourable.

01:33:11.211 --> 01:33:16.257
I feel certain
that he would have married her.

01:33:16.424 --> 01:33:17.675
Had it not been...

01:33:18.510 --> 01:33:20.552
For the money.

01:33:26.059 --> 01:33:30.604
Was I right to tell you?
Of course.

01:33:33.775 --> 01:33:38.362
Whatever his past actions,
whatever his present course,

01:33:38.530 --> 01:33:41.907
you may be certain that he loved you.

01:33:43.368 --> 01:33:45.536
But not enough.

01:33:46.997 --> 01:33:48.914
Not enough.

01:33:58.258 --> 01:34:01.844
Here is someone to cheer you up.

01:34:04.931 --> 01:34:09.310
How is your dear sister?

01:34:09.477 --> 01:34:11.395
Poor thing.

01:34:11.563 --> 01:34:16.483
I do not know what I'd do if a man
treated me with so little respect.

01:34:16.651 --> 01:34:19.069
Are you enjoying your stay
with John and Fanny?

01:34:19.237 --> 01:34:22.823
Oh, I was never so happy in my life.

01:34:22.991 --> 01:34:26.160
Your sister-in-law has taken to me.

01:34:26.328 --> 01:34:30.205
You cannot imagine what happened.

01:34:30.373 --> 01:34:31.415
No, I cannot.

01:34:31.583 --> 01:34:35.961
Yesterday I was introduced
to Edward's mother.

01:34:36.129 --> 01:34:38.881
She was more than civil.

01:34:39.049 --> 01:34:42.760
I have not yet seen Edward,
but I feel sure to, very soon.

01:34:44.095 --> 01:34:45.804
Come in.

01:34:48.058 --> 01:34:51.935
There is a Mr. Edward Ferrars
to see you, Miss Dashwood.

01:34:53.938 --> 01:34:55.356
Oh.

01:34:56.608 --> 01:34:58.942
Do ask him to come in.

01:35:04.783 --> 01:35:06.617
This way, sir.

01:35:24.928 --> 01:35:26.303
Mr. Ferrars.

01:35:27.514 --> 01:35:28.514
Miss Dashwood.

01:35:35.438 --> 01:35:38.148
What a pleasure to see you.
Miss Dashwood, how can I...?

01:35:38.316 --> 01:35:40.859
You know Miss Steele, of course.

01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:48.867
Indeed.
How do you do, Miss Steele?

01:35:49.536 --> 01:35:52.162
I am well, thank you.

01:35:54.707 --> 01:35:56.750
Do sit down.

01:35:58.461 --> 01:35:59.503
Thank you.

01:35:59.838 --> 01:36:01.213
Yes.

01:36:02.924 --> 01:36:08.846
Are you surprised to find me here
and not at your sister's house?

01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:14.560
Let me fetch Marianne. She would be
disappointed to miss you.

01:36:14.727 --> 01:36:15.727
Edward?

01:36:16.938 --> 01:36:19.606
Edward! I heard your voice.

01:36:20.942 --> 01:36:26.905
At last you found us.
My visit is shamefully overdue.

01:36:27.073 --> 01:36:30.284
You're pale. Are you not well?

01:36:30.452 --> 01:36:33.370
Don't think of me. Elinor is well.

01:36:33.538 --> 01:36:36.582
That is enough for both of us.

01:36:36.749 --> 01:36:40.127
Indeed. How do you enjoy London?

01:36:40.295 --> 01:36:44.047
The sight of you is all the pleasure
it has afforded.

01:36:44.215 --> 01:36:46.675
Is that not so?

01:36:49.012 --> 01:36:50.888
Why have you not visited before?

01:36:52.015 --> 01:36:53.974
I have been much engaged elsewhere.

01:36:54.309 --> 01:36:56.393
Engaged elsewhere?

01:36:56.561 --> 01:36:58.937
But what was that when there were
such friends to be met?

01:36:59.105 --> 01:37:02.566
Perhaps you think young men
never honour their engagements?

01:37:02.901 --> 01:37:04.109
No, indeed.

01:37:04.277 --> 01:37:08.864
Edward is the most incapable of
being selfish of anyone I ever saw.

01:37:12.368 --> 01:37:14.786
Edward, will you not sit?

01:37:15.163 --> 01:37:17.915
Help me to persuade him.

01:37:26.549 --> 01:37:29.092
Forgive me. I must take my leave.

01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:30.761
You are only just arrived.

01:37:30.929 --> 01:37:35.432
Excuse me, but I've
an urgent commission for Fanny.

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:39.686
Perhaps you might escort me
back to your sister's house.

01:37:42.857 --> 01:37:44.900
It would be an honour.

01:37:47.362 --> 01:37:48.946
Miss Dashwood.

01:37:49.656 --> 01:37:51.114
Marianne.

01:38:05.255 --> 01:38:07.881
Why did you not urge him to stay?

01:38:08.633 --> 01:38:11.343
He must have had his reasons.

01:38:11.511 --> 01:38:14.096
Yes, your coldness.

01:38:14.264 --> 01:38:18.308
Were I Edward,
I'd assume you didn't care for me.

01:38:22.272 --> 01:38:25.107
Marianne looked badly.

01:38:25.275 --> 01:38:28.819
It makes me fear
that I shall never marry.

01:38:28.987 --> 01:38:32.573
Nonsense. You will marry far better
than the Dashwood girls.

01:38:34.075 --> 01:38:37.327
But I have no dowry.

01:38:37.495 --> 01:38:42.958
There are other important qualities
that you have in abundance.

01:38:43.126 --> 01:38:48.005
It would not surprise me if you
married beyond your expectations.

01:38:48.172 --> 01:38:51.508
Oh, I wish that might be so.

01:38:53.219 --> 01:38:57.180
There is a young man.

01:38:57.348 --> 01:39:01.685
Aha. Is he of good fortune
and breeding?

01:39:01.853 --> 01:39:07.441
Of both. But his family
would certainly oppose the match.

01:39:07.609 --> 01:39:12.237
Hush. They will allow it
as soon as they see you.

01:39:12.405 --> 01:39:15.324
It is a very great secret.

01:39:15.533 --> 01:39:19.620
I've told nobody in the world
for fear of discovery.

01:39:20.788 --> 01:39:23.707
I am the soul of discretion.

01:39:24.834 --> 01:39:27.210
If I dared tell...

01:39:29.005 --> 01:39:33.425
I can assure you,
I am as silent as the grave.

01:39:41.059 --> 01:39:43.393
Viper in my bosom!

01:39:47.815 --> 01:39:49.733
Stop this!

01:40:06.501 --> 01:40:09.336
What a commotion!

01:40:09.504 --> 01:40:13.882
Edward Ferrars,
the one I used to joke you about,

01:40:14.050 --> 01:40:18.095
is engaged these five years
to Lucy Steele.

01:40:18.262 --> 01:40:22.265
Poor Mr. Ferrars. His mother,
who by all accounts is very proud,

01:40:22.433 --> 01:40:26.728
has demanded he break the
engagement or suffer disinheritance.

01:40:26.896 --> 01:40:30.107
But he refuses to break his promise.

01:40:30.274 --> 01:40:34.444
He has stood by her, good man,
and is cut off without a penny.

01:40:34.612 --> 01:40:38.448
She settled it all on Mr. Robert.

01:40:38.616 --> 01:40:40.784
I cannot sup. I must go to Lucy.

01:40:40.952 --> 01:40:45.288
Your sister-in-law
drove her to hysteria.

01:40:47.291 --> 01:40:48.792
How long have you known?

01:40:53.464 --> 01:40:56.383
Since the night Mrs. Jennings
invited us to London.

01:40:56.843 --> 01:40:58.802
Why did you not tell me?

01:40:59.721 --> 01:41:02.180
Lucy told me in confidence.

01:41:03.307 --> 01:41:06.226
I could not break my word.
He loves you!

01:41:06.394 --> 01:41:09.688
He made me no promises.
He tried to tell me about Lucy.

01:41:09.856 --> 01:41:11.815
He cannot marry her.

01:41:13.067 --> 01:41:15.569
Should he treat her worse
than Willoughby treated you?

01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:17.487
No.

01:41:17.822 --> 01:41:19.990
But he can't marry without love.

01:41:20.158 --> 01:41:24.411
He promised a long time ago.

01:41:24.579 --> 01:41:28.498
He may harbour some regret,
but he will be happy

01:41:28.666 --> 01:41:33.170
that he did his duty
and kept his word.

01:41:33.838 --> 01:41:36.339
After all,

01:41:37.216 --> 01:41:42.137
it is bewitching to think one's
happiness depends on one person,

01:41:42.305 --> 01:41:45.849
but it is not always possible.
We must accept.

01:41:46.684 --> 01:41:51.688
Edward will marry Lucy,
and you and I will go home.

01:41:52.398 --> 01:41:55.358
Always resignation and acceptance.

01:41:56.110 --> 01:41:59.696
Always prudence and honour and duty.

01:41:59.864 --> 01:42:02.866
Elinor, where is your heart?

01:42:04.035 --> 01:42:08.538
What do you know of my heart,
or anything but your own suffering?

01:42:08.706 --> 01:42:13.877
For weeks this has been pressed
on me, when I could not speak of it.

01:42:14.504 --> 01:42:19.841
Forced on me by the person whose
prior claims ruined all my hopes.

01:42:21.219 --> 01:42:26.181
I endured her exaltation, knowing
I was divided from Edward forever.

01:42:26.349 --> 01:42:32.229
If not bound to silence, I'd have
produced proof of a broken heart.

01:42:56.796 --> 01:42:58.171
Oh.

01:42:59.298 --> 01:43:03.218
I have heard your Mr. Ferrars

01:43:03.386 --> 01:43:06.805
has lost his fortune to his brother.

01:43:07.598 --> 01:43:12.185
Have I been rightly informed?
It is indeed so.

01:43:13.062 --> 01:43:15.605
Are you acquainted with him?

01:43:16.566 --> 01:43:19.484
No, we have never met.

01:43:20.653 --> 01:43:24.489
But I know only too well the cruelty

01:43:25.408 --> 01:43:31.037
of dividing two young people
long attached to one another.

01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:38.503
I have a proposal that may allow him
to marry Miss Steele immediately.

01:43:40.548 --> 01:43:45.385
As he is a friend to your family,
perhaps you'd mention it to him.

01:43:47.805 --> 01:43:49.681
Oh.

01:43:49.849 --> 01:43:54.561
I'm sure he'd be delighted
to hear it from your own lips.

01:43:56.230 --> 01:43:57.814
I think not.

01:43:59.317 --> 01:44:01.902
His behaviour has proved him proud.

01:44:02.737 --> 01:44:05.739
In the best sense.

01:44:07.658 --> 01:44:10.201
I feel certain
this is the right course.

01:44:16.834 --> 01:44:18.960
Mr. Edward Ferrars.

01:44:24.383 --> 01:44:26.468
Mr. Ferrars.

01:44:26.636 --> 01:44:28.178
Miss Dashwood.

01:44:30.014 --> 01:44:33.016
Thank you for responding so promptly.

01:44:33.184 --> 01:44:35.852
I was grateful
to receive your message.

01:44:37.271 --> 01:44:39.481
God knows what you must think of me.

01:44:39.649 --> 01:44:41.942
Mr. Ferrars...
I have no right to speak...

01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:45.570
I have good news.

01:44:45.738 --> 01:44:47.238
Do please sit down.

01:44:53.663 --> 01:44:57.332
You know of Colonel Brandon.

01:44:57.875 --> 01:44:59.084
I've heard his name.

01:44:59.251 --> 01:45:01.962
Colonel Brandon desires me to say,

01:45:02.129 --> 01:45:05.382
that as you wish to join the clergy,

01:45:05.549 --> 01:45:11.054
he has pleasure in offering
you the parish at Delaford,

01:45:11.222 --> 01:45:14.975
in the hope it may enable
you and Miss Steele to marry.

01:45:17.603 --> 01:45:19.396
Colonel Brandon?

01:45:19.563 --> 01:45:20.939
Yes.

01:45:21.107 --> 01:45:26.987
He means it as testimony of his
concern for this cruel situation.

01:45:29.782 --> 01:45:32.742
Colonel Brandon give me a parish?

01:45:34.245 --> 01:45:36.246
Can it be possible?

01:45:38.124 --> 01:45:39.874
The unkindness of your family

01:45:40.042 --> 01:45:43.545
makes you astonished
to find friendship elsewhere.

01:45:45.256 --> 01:45:46.923
No.

01:45:48.050 --> 01:45:50.093
Not to find it in you.

01:45:50.886 --> 01:45:55.765
I cannot be ignorant that it is
certainly to you that I owe this.

01:45:55.933 --> 01:46:00.020
I'd express it if I could,
but I am no orator...

01:46:00.187 --> 01:46:06.317
You are mistaken.
You owe it to your own merit.

01:46:10.865 --> 01:46:14.451
Colonel Brandon must be a man
of great worth.

01:46:14.618 --> 01:46:18.038
He is the kindest and best of men.

01:46:21.959 --> 01:46:26.504
May I ask why the colonel
did not tell me himself?

01:46:27.465 --> 01:46:32.343
I think he felt it would be better
coming from a friend.

01:46:37.683 --> 01:46:41.269
Your friendship has been
the most important of my life.

01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:48.651
You will always have it.

01:46:53.866 --> 01:46:55.700
Forgive me.

01:46:57.369 --> 01:47:02.624
You honour your promises. That is
more important than anything else.

01:47:02.792 --> 01:47:07.253
I wish you both very happy.

01:47:13.803 --> 01:47:15.178
Miss Dashwood.

01:47:46.961 --> 01:47:51.089
What luck for them to
find a parish so close to Barton.

01:47:51.257 --> 01:47:55.510
You'll all be able to meet very often.

01:47:55.678 --> 01:48:00.598
I've never disliked a person so much
as I do Mr. Willoughby.

01:48:00.766 --> 01:48:04.602
To think we can see
his house from the hill!

01:48:04.770 --> 01:48:08.273
I'll ask Jackson to plant trees.

01:48:08.858 --> 01:48:10.567
You'll do nothing of the sort.

01:48:10.985 --> 01:48:15.655
I hear Miss Grey's bridal
gown was everything of the finest...

01:48:27.585 --> 01:48:31.045
Mrs. Bunting!
We're in desperate need of tea.

01:48:31.213 --> 01:48:33.214
Thank you, colonel.

01:48:41.056 --> 01:48:43.766
She's not drawn breath since London.

01:48:43.934 --> 01:48:45.810
Had I only found another way home.

01:48:45.978 --> 01:48:48.938
There was no other way.

01:48:49.106 --> 01:48:52.525
I'll just take a stroll.
A moment's peace.

01:48:52.693 --> 01:48:56.279
- I think it is going to rain.
- Come have tea.

01:48:56.447 --> 01:48:59.699
No, it will not rain.
When you say so, it always does.

01:49:00.618 --> 01:49:03.620
I shall keep to the garden.

01:49:23.307 --> 01:49:25.975
We are very proud of our Thomas.

01:49:26.143 --> 01:49:32.565
His papa has such a way with him.

01:49:44.370 --> 01:49:49.874
Oh, there you are, Miss Dashwood.
Come and meet little Thomas.

01:50:05.391 --> 01:50:07.892
I cannot see Marianne.

01:50:47.433 --> 01:50:52.770
Love is not love which alters
when it alteration finds,

01:50:54.315 --> 01:50:58.234
or bends with the remover to remove.

01:50:59.903 --> 01:51:04.532
Oh, no, 'tis an ever fixed mark

01:51:05.284 --> 01:51:09.454
that looks on tempests
and is never shaken.

01:51:12.041 --> 01:51:14.041
Willoughby.

01:51:27.056 --> 01:51:28.806
Marianne?

01:51:29.266 --> 01:51:34.854
She'll be wet through.
Thank you for pointing that out.

01:51:35.856 --> 01:51:39.359
Do not worry, Miss Dashwood.
Brandon will find her.

01:51:39.943 --> 01:51:43.029
We can all guess where she went.

01:51:51.830 --> 01:51:53.873
Miss Dashwood.
Oh, thank you.

01:52:13.602 --> 01:52:16.896
She's not hurt,
but we must get her warm.

01:52:17.856 --> 01:52:22.985
There is a fire lit in my room.
Do hurry!

01:52:48.846 --> 01:52:50.430
Miss Dashwood.

01:52:50.848 --> 01:52:53.558
I think Marianne may need a doctor.

01:53:14.079 --> 01:53:16.873
You'll wear yourself out.

01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:20.918
A day or two in bed
will set her to rights.

01:53:21.086 --> 01:53:25.006
You can rely upon Harris, colonel.
I've never found a better physician.

01:53:27.718 --> 01:53:30.761
What is the diagnosis?
It is an infectious fever.

01:53:30.929 --> 01:53:34.932
It has taken far more serious hold
than I would expect in one so young.

01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:41.397
I recommend removing your child.
Mrs. Bunting!

01:53:49.573 --> 01:53:55.077
Miss Dashwood,
I am more sorry than I can say.

01:53:55.245 --> 01:53:57.622
If you prefer me to stay, I shall.

01:53:58.916 --> 01:54:01.459
That is very kind.

01:54:01.627 --> 01:54:05.588
But Colonel Brandon and Dr. Harris
will look after us.

01:54:05.756 --> 01:54:08.508
Thank you for all you have done.

01:54:37.454 --> 01:54:39.830
She's not doing as well
as I would like.

01:54:55.305 --> 01:54:57.390
What can I do?

01:54:59.977 --> 01:55:01.811
You've done so much already.

01:55:01.979 --> 01:55:05.982
Give me an occupation,
or I shall run mad.

01:55:06.567 --> 01:55:09.652
She would be easier
if her mother were here.

01:55:11.238 --> 01:55:12.488
Of course.

01:55:55.532 --> 01:55:57.199
I must fetch more laudanum.

01:55:58.327 --> 01:56:00.995
I cannot pretend
that your sister's condition

01:56:01.163 --> 01:56:03.956
is not very serious.

01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:12.048
You must prepare yourself.

01:56:13.091 --> 01:56:15.384
I will return shortly.

01:56:33.362 --> 01:56:35.071
Marianne.

01:56:36.073 --> 01:56:38.699
Marianne, please try.

01:56:41.620 --> 01:56:43.329
Marianne.

01:56:46.416 --> 01:56:49.085
Please try.

01:56:56.468 --> 01:56:58.135
Oh.

01:57:01.098 --> 01:57:03.015
I cannot...

01:57:03.892 --> 01:57:06.394
I cannot do without you.

01:57:09.815 --> 01:57:11.148
Oh, please.

01:57:14.444 --> 01:57:19.407
I've tried to bear everything else.
I will try...

01:57:21.034 --> 01:57:24.620
But please, dearest...

01:57:29.126 --> 01:57:31.669
beloved Marianne,

01:57:35.841 --> 01:57:38.467
do not leave me alone.

01:58:34.107 --> 01:58:35.858
Elinor.

01:59:02.385 --> 01:59:04.011
My mother.

01:59:11.394 --> 01:59:13.562
Mama! Mama!

01:59:13.730 --> 01:59:17.358
She is out of danger.
She is out of danger.

01:59:25.742 --> 01:59:28.994
Oh, my Mary.

01:59:30.747 --> 01:59:33.958
- Where is Elinor?
- I'm here.

01:59:34.543 --> 01:59:36.752
Dearest, I am here.

01:59:41.967 --> 01:59:43.926
Colonel Brandon.

01:59:52.352 --> 01:59:54.270
Thank you.

02:00:36.688 --> 02:00:42.401
He's not so dashing as Willoughby,
but he has a pleasing countenance.

02:00:43.445 --> 02:00:49.158
There was something in Willoughby's
eyes at times that I did not like.

02:00:53.496 --> 02:00:57.249
"Nor is the earth
the lesse, or loseth aught.

02:00:57.417 --> 02:01:00.920
What from one place doth fall

02:01:01.087 --> 02:01:04.965
is with the tide unto another brought.

02:01:06.217 --> 02:01:11.013
For there is nothing lost
but may be found

02:01:12.474 --> 02:01:14.433
if sought."

02:01:19.522 --> 02:01:21.857
Shall we continue tomorrow?

02:01:22.025 --> 02:01:24.610
No, for I must away.

02:01:24.778 --> 02:01:27.529
Away? Where?

02:01:28.198 --> 02:01:30.950
That I cannot tell you.

02:01:31.117 --> 02:01:32.618
It is a secret.

02:01:37.290 --> 02:01:39.458
You will not stay away long?

02:01:57.644 --> 02:01:59.228
There.

02:02:01.648 --> 02:02:05.401
There I fell,
and there I first saw Willoughby.

02:02:07.737 --> 02:02:11.240
Poor Willoughby.
He will always regret you.

02:02:12.617 --> 02:02:17.037
Does it follow that, had he chosen
me, he would have been content?

02:02:18.415 --> 02:02:21.917
He would have had a wife he loved,
but no money,

02:02:23.169 --> 02:02:29.174
and might have learned to rank
his pocketbook above his heart.

02:02:33.138 --> 02:02:37.266
If his regrets are half as painful
as mine, he will suffer enough.

02:02:38.935 --> 02:02:41.103
Do you compare your conduct with his?

02:02:41.730 --> 02:02:43.230
No.

02:02:44.816 --> 02:02:47.568
I compare it with what it
ought to have been.

02:02:48.862 --> 02:02:50.904
With yours.

02:03:03.334 --> 02:03:05.794
Oh, Thomas.
I fetched those beef fillets, ma'am.

02:03:07.922 --> 02:03:10.591
Beef is less expensive in Exeter.

02:03:10.759 --> 02:03:13.052
Anyway, it's for Marianne.

02:03:14.637 --> 02:03:17.014
Was Exeter crowded?
It was, ma'am.

02:03:17.182 --> 02:03:20.809
Mrs. Braintree said Miss Pothington
has had another stroke.

02:03:21.811 --> 02:03:28.192
And Miss Murden has turned away
Coles for his drunkenness.

02:03:28.359 --> 02:03:31.820
Oh, and Mr. Ferrars is married,
but of course you know that.

02:03:31.988 --> 02:03:33.906
But, Elinor...

02:03:37.285 --> 02:03:40.162
Who told you he was married?

02:03:40.330 --> 02:03:44.708
I seen Mrs. Ferrars myself.

02:03:44.876 --> 02:03:47.961
She and Mr. Ferrars
stopped at the inn.

02:03:48.129 --> 02:03:52.716
I saw it was Miss Steele,
so I took off my hat.

02:03:52.884 --> 02:03:57.805
And she enquired after all of you,
especially Miss Dashwood.

02:03:57.972 --> 02:04:01.725
She bade me give their compliments.

02:04:01.893 --> 02:04:05.145
They're sending a piece of the cake.

02:04:07.190 --> 02:04:12.694
Did Mrs. Ferrars seem well?
She said she was vastly contented.

02:04:12.862 --> 02:04:17.699
As she was always an affable lady,
I made free to wish her joy.

02:04:18.368 --> 02:04:20.536
Thank you, Thomas.

02:04:52.694 --> 02:04:56.822
What is it, Thomas?
I'm not sure, but it's heavy.

02:04:57.740 --> 02:05:03.495
"It is small enough for the parlour.
When I follow shortly, I expect

02:05:03.663 --> 02:05:07.249
that you've learnt the enclosed.
Your friend, Christopher Brandon."

02:05:07.417 --> 02:05:11.753
Oh, my darling, look.
It fits perfectly.

02:05:13.590 --> 02:05:16.258
Here you are, Miss Marianne.

02:05:17.260 --> 02:05:19.052
Fetch some tea.

02:05:19.637 --> 02:05:21.722
He must like you very much.

02:05:21.890 --> 02:05:25.976
It is not just for me,
it's for all of us.

02:06:13.942 --> 02:06:16.860
Here is Colonel Brandon.

02:06:26.996 --> 02:06:29.122
I do not think it is the colonel.

02:06:29.290 --> 02:06:34.503
He said he would arrive today.
Play your new song for him.

02:06:35.004 --> 02:06:36.838
Edward!

02:06:37.674 --> 02:06:40.050
It is Edward!

02:06:42.845 --> 02:06:46.348
Calm. We must be calm.

02:07:07.704 --> 02:07:10.247
Mr. Ferrars for you, ma'am.

02:07:14.419 --> 02:07:16.503
Edward.

02:07:16.671 --> 02:07:18.588
What a pleasure to see you.

02:07:19.132 --> 02:07:20.674
Mrs. Dashwood.

02:07:21.843 --> 02:07:24.803
Miss Marianne, Margaret...

02:07:25.471 --> 02:07:26.471
Miss Dashwood.

02:07:36.024 --> 02:07:37.941
I trust I find you all well?

02:07:38.651 --> 02:07:42.279
Thank you. We are all very well.

02:07:47.368 --> 02:07:52.414
We've been enjoying fine weather...
Well, we have.

02:07:53.958 --> 02:07:57.669
I'm glad to hear it.
The roads were very...

02:07:58.129 --> 02:07:59.796
dry.

02:08:03.843 --> 02:08:07.679
May I wish you great joy, Edward.

02:08:08.556 --> 02:08:09.931
Thank you.

02:08:26.407 --> 02:08:29.910
I hope you have left
Mrs. Ferrars well.

02:08:32.455 --> 02:08:35.707
Tolerably. Thank you.

02:08:40.630 --> 02:08:43.382
I...
Is Mrs. Ferrars at the new parish?

02:08:44.801 --> 02:08:48.929
No, my mother is in town.

02:08:49.305 --> 02:08:52.808
I meant Mrs. Edward Ferrars.

02:08:56.312 --> 02:08:58.146
Well, then you...

02:08:59.023 --> 02:09:00.399
You've not heard?

02:09:02.527 --> 02:09:06.488
I think you mean my brother.
Mrs. Robert Ferrars.

02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:11.076
Mrs. Robert Ferrars?

02:09:11.828 --> 02:09:13.161
Yes.

02:09:15.123 --> 02:09:17.249
I...

02:09:17.667 --> 02:09:21.086
I received a letter from Miss Steele,

02:09:21.254 --> 02:09:25.507
or Mrs. Ferrars, I should say,

02:09:25.675 --> 02:09:28.176
communicating to me

02:09:28.344 --> 02:09:33.306
the transfer of her affections
to my brother Robert.

02:09:34.225 --> 02:09:38.019
It seems they were much
thrown together in London.

02:09:39.439 --> 02:09:44.818
In view of my new circumstances,
I felt it only right

02:09:44.986 --> 02:09:48.864
that she be released
from our engagement.

02:09:49.782 --> 02:09:53.910
At any rate, they were married
last week in Plymouth.

02:09:59.959 --> 02:10:01.877
Then you...

02:10:04.881 --> 02:10:06.256
are not married?

02:10:08.593 --> 02:10:10.552
No.

02:10:38.414 --> 02:10:40.248
Elinor,

02:10:40.875 --> 02:10:44.252
I met Lucy when I was very young.

02:10:44.420 --> 02:10:50.258
Had I had a profession, I would not
have felt such an idle inclination.

02:10:51.260 --> 02:10:54.179
My behaviour at Norland
was very wrong.

02:10:54.347 --> 02:10:57.933
I convinced myself that
you felt only friendship for me,

02:10:58.100 --> 02:11:01.937
and that it was my heart alone
that I was risking.

02:11:02.396 --> 02:11:05.774
I have come with no expectations,

02:11:05.942 --> 02:11:08.985
only to profess, now I am able,

02:11:10.571 --> 02:11:16.535
that my heart is, and always will be,

02:11:18.579 --> 02:11:20.330
yours.

02:11:35.179 --> 02:11:37.973
He's sitting next to her.
Margaret, come down.

02:11:38.140 --> 02:11:39.975
Will you stop that?
What else?

02:11:40.142 --> 02:11:42.519
Oh, Marianne.
Tell us!

02:11:42.687 --> 02:11:44.020
Wait.

02:11:44.188 --> 02:11:46.106
He's kneeling down!
