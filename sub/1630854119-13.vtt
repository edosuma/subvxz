WEBVTT

00:02.698 --> 00:03.829
Are you seriously
doing this to me?

00:03.916 --> 00:05.135
You're breaking up with me?
- Yes.

00:05.222 --> 00:06.571
- Why?
- I can't do this.

00:06.658 --> 00:08.356
Sabrina, this is insane.

00:08.443 --> 00:10.097
Stop walking away
and talk to me!

00:10.184 --> 00:12.490
Is it your parents?
- No, I told you that already.

00:12.577 --> 00:13.839
Then what is it?
What did I do?

00:13.926 --> 00:15.972
Let go, you're hurting me.

00:16.059 --> 00:18.409
Look, I'm--I'm sorry.

00:18.496 --> 00:20.107
I just don't understand.

00:22.239 --> 00:25.721
Let me come and get you later
and we'll talk it out, OK?

00:25.808 --> 00:26.939
I can't.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.594
I have plans tonight.

00:29.681 --> 00:33.642
Are you seeing somebody else?

00:33.729 --> 00:36.732
I'm sorry, I have to go.

00:36.819 --> 00:39.604
Sabrina!

00:52.095 --> 00:54.315
Good evening. Checking in?

00:54.402 --> 00:56.447
Uh, actually, I'm here to
see someone.

00:56.534 --> 00:58.406
Mm?

00:58.493 --> 01:01.539
He's already here, Mr. Jama.

01:01.626 --> 01:03.193
Oh, I see.

01:12.115 --> 01:13.551
Sabrina?

01:13.638 --> 01:14.596
Yes.

01:14.683 --> 01:16.119
He left you a key.

01:16.206 --> 01:18.817
Room 366.
Elevators to your left.

01:47.019 --> 01:49.587
Sabrina.

01:49.674 --> 01:50.762
Hello.

01:50.849 --> 01:52.895
It's nice to meet you.

01:52.982 --> 01:56.899
You look even more beautiful
than in the pictures.

02:02.992 --> 02:05.125
Hmm.

02:05.212 --> 02:08.128
Did you bring something to
change into?

02:15.178 --> 02:18.573
Perfect.

02:18.660 --> 02:20.052
Why don't you make yourself comfortable

02:20.140 --> 02:22.707
while I go freshen up, hmm?

02:37.331 --> 02:40.508
That's probably the food.
I ordered it for us.

02:40.595 --> 02:42.249
Can you grab it, please?

02:42.336 --> 02:46.383
And make sure there is no pork.

02:48.124 --> 02:50.996
Sabrina, are you OK?

02:54.130 --> 02:56.698
No! No!

03:02.225 --> 03:04.967
Help! Please, help!

03:05.054 --> 03:07.752
Help me!

03:07.839 --> 03:09.798
Let me go! No!

03:09.885 --> 03:12.670
Help me! Help!

03:12.757 --> 03:15.717
No, no, no!

03:15.804 --> 03:17.414
Let me out!

03:17.501 --> 03:20.374
Help!

03:24.639 --> 03:26.249
Hey!

03:26.336 --> 03:28.599
What are you doing? Let her go!

03:28.686 --> 03:31.080
- Help!
- Let her go!

04:06.333 --> 04:07.769
Thank you.

04:12.904 --> 04:15.080
Uh, Cora's a teacher?

04:15.167 --> 04:18.649
No, she is a PhD candidate
in psych at LIU.

04:18.736 --> 04:20.477
Well, instead of
cyberstalking her,

04:20.564 --> 04:22.044
you could just ask her out already.

04:22.131 --> 04:23.872
I hit her up two days ago.
She hasn't responded.

04:23.959 --> 04:26.135
Well, that thing works
as a phone, too.

04:26.222 --> 04:27.136
Usually, I would say
just call her

04:27.223 --> 04:28.659
but your timing is terrible.

04:28.746 --> 04:29.965
I mean, this week is--

04:30.052 --> 04:32.097
The Valentine's Day vortex,
I know.

04:32.184 --> 04:34.230
Valentine's Day is Tuesday.

04:34.317 --> 04:35.884
I mean, any date that you go on
is gonna have the pressure to

04:35.971 --> 04:37.668
be the greatest date
of all time.

04:37.755 --> 04:39.409
Right, not to mention
the jacked up prices

04:39.496 --> 04:41.759
at the restaurants.
- Restaurants, candy, flowers.

04:41.846 --> 04:43.195
I mean, the best thing about
Valentine's Day is

04:43.283 --> 04:45.110
the day after when
everything is half off.

04:45.197 --> 04:48.375
All right, so how do I--

04:48.462 --> 04:50.638
how do I ask her out
in a non-romantic,

04:50.725 --> 04:51.682
no pressure kind of way.

04:53.075 --> 04:55.817
Just do it.
Hope for the best.

04:57.645 --> 04:59.995
Hey. What's up?

05:00.082 --> 05:01.213
OK.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.998
Sure. We're on our way.

05:03.085 --> 05:04.565
That was Remy.

05:04.652 --> 05:06.349
He said "meet at the airport
and bring a heavy coat."

05:06.436 --> 05:08.873
- Where we going?
- Minneapolis.

05:11.789 --> 05:13.704
This is Agent Mohamed.
She's been posted here

05:13.791 --> 05:15.489
the last five years
in Minneapolis

05:15.576 --> 05:17.404
and knows the community
we're dealing with well.

05:17.491 --> 05:18.840
You're originally
from Somalia, correct?

05:18.927 --> 05:20.537
Yes.
But I was raised here.

05:20.624 --> 05:21.886
Started with Detroit PD

05:21.973 --> 05:24.454
and then came back after
I joined the bureau.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.935
Should we dive in?
- I thought you'd never ask.

05:27.022 --> 05:29.546
Last night, 43-year-old
Hassan Jama was shot twice

05:29.633 --> 05:32.288
outside the Roosevelt Hotel downtown.

05:32.375 --> 05:33.942
The hotel bellman stepped out
for a smoke

05:34.029 --> 05:36.901
on the loading dock, saw
Hassan, and called the cops.

05:36.988 --> 05:38.338
So why aren't they
handling this?

05:38.425 --> 05:39.556
It's not just a homicide.

05:39.643 --> 05:41.079
A minor was abducted.

05:41.166 --> 05:42.733
And the Somali community in Minneapolis

05:42.820 --> 05:45.693
don't trust local PD.
- Why's that?

05:45.780 --> 05:48.478
Started around 9/11.
And a few years later,

05:48.565 --> 05:50.393
a lot of Somali kids
in the area were charged with

05:50.480 --> 05:52.395
aiding and abetting
known terrorists.

05:52.482 --> 05:54.658
Al-Shabab. Yeah, a lot
of those cases were

05:54.745 --> 05:57.139
questionable though, as far as
entrapment is concerned.

05:57.226 --> 05:59.620
One of the reasons for
the trust issues.

05:59.707 --> 06:02.666
What do we have on
the missing minor?

06:02.753 --> 06:05.713
She's a Somali refugee
named Sabrina Abdirashid,

06:05.800 --> 06:07.671
a 14-year-old freshman
at West High School.

06:07.758 --> 06:10.587
Her parents told PD
she's a straight-A student.

06:10.674 --> 06:13.242
So what's she doing at
a hotel with Hassan?

06:13.329 --> 06:15.766
That's where it gets ugly.
He paid for a suite

06:15.853 --> 06:18.073
and left a key for her
at the front desk.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.031
PD found condoms in the bedroom

06:20.118 --> 06:23.252
and a nightgown and lingerie in
Sabrina's overnight bag.

06:23.339 --> 06:24.775
You think this girl's
a prostitute?

06:24.862 --> 06:26.951
Unfortunately,
we see this a lot here.

06:27.038 --> 06:29.476
Hard times lead people to do
desperate things.

06:29.563 --> 06:30.955
They're looking for extra cash.

06:31.042 --> 06:32.392
All right,
but why kill Hassan?

06:32.479 --> 06:33.610
Could be a date that went bad

06:33.697 --> 06:35.133
and Sabrina had a friend
waiting outside.

06:35.220 --> 06:36.874
That makes sense.

06:36.961 --> 06:38.615
Hassan didn't pay and
her friend killed him

06:38.702 --> 06:41.749
or he's the guy
that's running her.

06:41.836 --> 06:43.751
And Hassan?

06:43.838 --> 06:45.143
He's a businessman
from Rochester

06:45.230 --> 06:46.971
with no criminal record.

06:47.058 --> 06:48.799
Has a wife there named Naima.

06:48.886 --> 06:49.931
Something tells me
she wasn't aware of

06:50.018 --> 06:54.152
his extracurricular activities.
Any other leads?

06:54.239 --> 06:56.024
A witness reported
a black Dodge Charger

06:56.111 --> 06:57.460
leaving the scene of the crime,

06:57.547 --> 06:59.419
but didn't see the driver
or the plates.

06:59.506 --> 07:01.638
And this,
a vase found shattered

07:01.725 --> 07:03.248
on the floor of the suite.

07:03.335 --> 07:06.121
ERT's testing every piece
for prints or DNA.

07:06.208 --> 07:07.818
Could take a while.

07:07.905 --> 07:09.646
Kristin and Ray,
take Hassan's wife.

07:09.733 --> 07:11.518
Hana, work with Agent Mohamed
and ERT.

07:11.605 --> 07:13.389
Barnes and I will go see
Sabrina's parents.

07:13.476 --> 07:14.999
Let's roll.

07:18.612 --> 07:20.962
Naima, if I may ask,

07:21.049 --> 07:23.791
can you tell me why Hassan was
in Minneapolis last night?

07:23.878 --> 07:26.315
My husband has
three nursing homes there.

07:26.402 --> 07:27.708
He goes there to maintain them

07:27.795 --> 07:31.407
while I stay at home and
take care of our son.

07:31.494 --> 07:33.627
Do any of you know this girl?

07:33.714 --> 07:35.498
No, sorry.

07:35.585 --> 07:36.717
Who is she?

07:36.804 --> 07:38.806
Her name is
Sabrina Abdirashid.

07:38.893 --> 07:41.243
She was with
your husband last night

07:41.330 --> 07:43.332
in his hotel room.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.553
That can't be true.

07:46.640 --> 07:50.513
She's 14, Naima.

07:50.600 --> 07:53.211
And I mean absolutely
no disrespect,

07:53.298 --> 07:54.561
but I have to ask you

07:54.648 --> 07:56.258
if your husband has
paid for sex before.

07:59.217 --> 08:01.785
Hassan is
a devout Muslim man.

08:01.872 --> 08:05.746
He would never see a call girl,
let alone a girl that age.

08:05.833 --> 08:10.359
I don't believe it.
No, no, no, no.

08:10.446 --> 08:13.580
We already spoke to police
last night about Sabrina.

08:13.667 --> 08:15.233
Why aren't you out looking
for our daughter?

08:15.320 --> 08:17.671
We're not the police,
Mr. Abdirashid, we're the FBI.

08:17.758 --> 08:21.326
We're working very hard to
find Sabrina.

08:21.413 --> 08:23.067
Do you know this man?
- No.

08:23.154 --> 08:25.156
Do you have any idea
why she would be with this man

08:25.243 --> 08:27.724
last night in a downtown hotel?

08:27.811 --> 08:30.118
I don't know.
You're the FBI, tell us.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.514
I know this is hard to hear,

08:34.601 --> 08:38.822
but we think he was paying
Sabrina for sex.

08:38.909 --> 08:40.389
How dare you come to my house

08:40.476 --> 08:43.000
and say such a thing about
my daughter?

08:43.087 --> 08:45.220
The FBI never helped us,

08:45.307 --> 08:47.439
always thinking
we are terrorists.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.006
And now, you come to my home

08:49.093 --> 08:51.705
and disrespect me
and my family?

08:51.792 --> 08:54.403
I know who took her.

08:54.490 --> 08:56.666
It was Derrick Jackson.
- Who's that?

08:56.753 --> 08:58.233
Goes to school with Sabrina.

08:58.320 --> 09:01.236
He's a bad influence to her,
smoking and partying.

09:01.323 --> 09:03.151
I forbid her from
talking to him.

09:03.238 --> 09:05.588
I know he took her. It's him.

09:08.591 --> 09:10.898
Can I help you in
the kitchen with that?

09:18.645 --> 09:21.169
I can't imagine
what you're going through.

09:21.256 --> 09:22.692
I have a seven-year-old
daughter.

09:22.779 --> 09:24.607
If she went missing,
I'd be a mess.

09:24.694 --> 09:26.827
Thank you.

09:26.914 --> 09:29.656
Mariam, do you know
where Sabrina is?

09:29.743 --> 09:33.007
No, I don't.

09:33.094 --> 09:35.705
Is there anything you want
to tell me?

09:35.792 --> 09:36.924
Listen, you can trust me.

09:37.011 --> 09:39.448
I promise you,
I just want to help.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.019
What my husband says is true.

09:45.106 --> 09:49.980
It's that boy from her school,
Derrick Jackson.

09:50.067 --> 09:53.027
Does Sabrina have
a phone or a laptop?

09:53.114 --> 09:54.594
I have her phone.

09:54.681 --> 09:57.553
I took it away when I forbid
Derrick away from her.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.511
Thank you.
We'll get right on this.

10:02.776 --> 10:06.170
I'm gonna get Kristin and Ray
over to Sabrina's high school.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.668
Derrick Jackson?

10:25.755 --> 10:27.061
Yeah?

10:27.148 --> 10:28.889
Agent Gaines, Agent Cannon
with the FBI.

10:28.976 --> 10:31.326
Can we have a word?

10:36.766 --> 10:38.463
Yo, what is this?
I didn't do anything.

10:38.550 --> 10:40.074
Are you Sabrina Abdirashid's
boyfriend?

10:40.161 --> 10:42.032
Yeah.

10:42.119 --> 10:44.208
I mean, I was, until
she broke up with me yesterday.

10:44.295 --> 10:46.602
Where were you last night?

10:46.689 --> 10:48.691
Wait, you guys think I had
something to do with this?

10:48.778 --> 10:50.214
I would never hurt Sabrina.
I love her.

10:50.301 --> 10:53.478
Just answer the question.

10:53.565 --> 10:55.219
I was at hockey practice.

10:55.306 --> 10:58.092
I was hanging out with
my boy, Eli, and--

10:58.179 --> 10:59.876
I swear.
His family has a Ring camera.

10:59.963 --> 11:01.399
You can check.
I'm not lying to you.

11:01.486 --> 11:02.574
Why did Sabrina break up
with you?

11:02.662 --> 11:04.185
Did she say?

11:04.272 --> 11:05.665
I mean, she would never
admit it,

11:05.752 --> 11:07.754
but it's because of
her wack-ass dad.

11:07.841 --> 11:10.539
He doesn't want us to be
together because I'm Black.

11:10.626 --> 11:12.454
- Hmm.
- What do you mean?

11:12.541 --> 11:14.586
He thinks he's so much better
than me just cause he's African

11:14.674 --> 11:16.545
and he knows where
his ancestors are from.

11:16.632 --> 11:18.765
Well, mine is from Alabama,
and now we're here.

11:18.852 --> 11:20.854
And that doesn't make me any
less of a person than he is.

11:20.941 --> 11:22.246
What kind of car
do you drive?

11:22.333 --> 11:24.335
2012 Prius.

11:24.422 --> 11:26.424
- In Minnesota?
- Yeah.

11:26.511 --> 11:28.644
My dad got it from me
on my 16th birthday.

11:28.731 --> 11:30.515
Do me a favor; write your
friend Eli's number down.

11:30.602 --> 11:32.909
We're gonna check
that Ring camera.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.348
Look, you guys gotta
find Sabrina.

11:37.435 --> 11:38.741
Please.

11:38.828 --> 11:41.048
We're all pretty upset
about it.

11:41.135 --> 11:42.266
Thank you.

11:42.353 --> 11:44.181
You can go back to
your friends.

11:47.097 --> 11:48.142
We'll obviously check this,

11:48.229 --> 11:49.230
but I don't think
he's involved.

11:49.317 --> 11:50.884
Me neither.

11:50.971 --> 11:52.276
So who took her?

12:01.895 --> 12:05.768
Help! Help, somebody!

12:05.855 --> 12:08.118
<i>Please! I'm in the trunk!</i>

12:08.205 --> 12:12.732
<i>Can anybody hear me? Help!</i>

12:12.819 --> 12:15.256
Who are you?
Just let me go!

12:15.343 --> 12:17.824
Stop! Please!
No, no, no, just let me go!

12:17.911 --> 12:20.174
- Stop screaming.
- Leave me alone!

12:20.261 --> 12:23.568
No!

12:23.655 --> 12:25.440
Bitch, quit making this
so damn hard!

12:25.527 --> 12:26.833
Hold still.

12:38.409 --> 12:39.671
I got the photo
15 minutes ago,

12:39.759 --> 12:41.412
but I don't recognize
the number.

12:41.499 --> 12:43.763
They're not asking for
ransom just yet.

12:43.850 --> 12:44.981
They're making a point,

12:45.068 --> 12:47.027
showing their power
and advantage.

12:47.114 --> 12:47.984
The good news is,
she's alive

12:48.071 --> 12:49.420
and she doesn't appear to
be hurt.

12:49.507 --> 12:52.119
She's only a child.
Who would do this?

12:52.206 --> 12:53.729
That boyfriend.
I already told you.

12:53.816 --> 12:55.470
It isn't Derrick Jackson.

12:55.557 --> 12:57.994
He has an alibi and he wasn't
at the hotel last night.

12:58.081 --> 13:00.170
His name has been cleared
from our list.

13:00.257 --> 13:01.911
It had to have been him.

13:01.998 --> 13:04.653
Levan, are you feuding with
anyone or have any enemies?

13:04.740 --> 13:05.959
No one.

13:06.046 --> 13:07.874
I don't have any
non-Muslim friends.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.747
Aabo, Hooyo,
I heard what happened

13:11.834 --> 13:13.575
and drove straight here
from Michigan.

13:13.662 --> 13:14.837
Our son, Bohan.

13:14.924 --> 13:17.753
He's an imam at
a mosque in Detroit.

13:19.581 --> 13:22.062
Agents Scott and Barnes, FBI.

13:22.149 --> 13:23.672
- Did you find my sister?
- Nothing yet

13:23.759 --> 13:26.327
but we're making progress.

13:26.414 --> 13:28.024
Do you know anyone
who would want to take Sabrina

13:28.111 --> 13:30.374
or kill Hassan Jama?

13:30.461 --> 13:33.377
Hassan?

13:33.464 --> 13:35.249
Aabo, you said you wouldn't.

13:35.336 --> 13:36.772
You promised me and Hooyo

13:36.859 --> 13:39.296
you'd wait until Sabrina was
old enough.

13:39.383 --> 13:42.604
- What are you talking about?
- You didn't tell them?

13:42.691 --> 13:44.693
Tell us what?

13:47.130 --> 13:49.785
Levan, we're on your side

13:49.872 --> 13:51.526
and we're trying to help you.

13:51.613 --> 13:53.615
But if you're not completely
honest with us,

13:53.702 --> 13:55.747
we can't do our job.

13:55.835 --> 13:56.748
What are you not telling us?

14:01.492 --> 14:03.843
My father saw Sabrina kissing
Derrick one night

14:03.930 --> 14:06.193
when he was dropping her off
at school.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.759
He felt she brought shame
to the family

14:07.847 --> 14:09.500
for being with a non-mahram,

14:09.587 --> 14:11.241
a man that's
not permissible by marriage

14:11.328 --> 14:13.461
or that's not her family.

14:13.548 --> 14:16.203
So my father married
Sabrina off to Hassan.

14:16.290 --> 14:17.682
You married off
your 14-year-old daughter

14:17.769 --> 14:19.771
just to save face?

14:19.859 --> 14:21.643
I was protecting her.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.166
I'm her father.

14:23.253 --> 14:25.125
If the community found out
what she did,

14:25.212 --> 14:27.431
who would want her?

14:27.518 --> 14:28.606
Nobody.

14:32.088 --> 14:33.785
So Sabrina's a child bride.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.483
Yes, and the wedding
was yesterday.

14:35.570 --> 14:37.354
Her parents didn't tell us
because it's illegal

14:37.441 --> 14:40.009
to get married under
the age of 18 in Minnesota.

14:40.096 --> 14:41.097
Then we should arrest them.

14:41.184 --> 14:42.664
We're trying to
earn their trust.

14:42.751 --> 14:44.535
Putting them in jail
doesn't help that.

14:44.622 --> 14:46.320
Does it not sound like
child endangerment?

14:46.407 --> 14:48.278
Yeah. Plus, Hassan is
married already.

14:48.365 --> 14:49.671
How is this not polygamy?

14:49.758 --> 14:52.239
Because Islam allows for
multiple wives

14:52.326 --> 14:55.764
and Minnesota law only applies
to state-sanctioned marriages.

14:55.851 --> 14:58.810
But child brides are common
in East African countries.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.770
My own mother was married off
when she was 15.

15:01.857 --> 15:03.119
Sometimes it's for safety

15:03.206 --> 15:05.208
so the girl can be
better taken care of.

15:05.295 --> 15:07.907
Other times, it's for money

15:07.994 --> 15:09.386
to help the family pay off
their debts.

15:09.473 --> 15:11.127
Like a piece of property?

15:11.214 --> 15:12.607
I'm not condoning it.

15:12.694 --> 15:14.261
Just trying to
help you understand.

15:14.348 --> 15:16.045
It's a cultural difference.

15:16.132 --> 15:17.786
Imam Bohan just sent me a
video of the wedding yesterday.

15:17.873 --> 15:19.092
Nikah.

15:19.179 --> 15:21.529
The ceremony is called a nikah.

15:21.616 --> 15:23.792
The point is, there might be
a witness we can talk to.

15:23.879 --> 15:25.837
Can you put this up?

15:31.887 --> 15:34.411
That's a small nikah.

15:34.498 --> 15:36.631
Probably because of how rushed
the marriage was.

15:36.718 --> 15:37.719
Where's Sabrina?

15:37.806 --> 15:38.938
She was at school.

15:39.025 --> 15:40.113
Wait, she didn't attend
her own wedding?

15:40.200 --> 15:41.114
That's how it works.

15:41.201 --> 15:43.116
Nikah's are men only.

15:43.203 --> 15:45.770
She probably didn't meet him
until she got to the hotel.

15:45.857 --> 15:47.207
Makes for quite
the wedding night.

15:49.122 --> 15:50.645
Wait, wait, wait.
Pause it right there.

15:50.732 --> 15:51.515
What is that?

15:51.602 --> 15:53.039
The dowry.

15:53.126 --> 15:56.216
Either money, gold, land,
anything really.

15:56.303 --> 15:59.262
Hana looked into Hassan's
bank account earlier today,

15:59.349 --> 16:00.785
said he pulled out
$100,000 in cash

16:00.872 --> 16:02.004
but she doesn't know why.

16:02.091 --> 16:04.833
We do now. It was that dowry.

16:04.920 --> 16:07.662
ERT just got a hit on
the broken vase at the hotel,

16:07.749 --> 16:11.622
Osman Abdow, 22 years old.
He's from here in Minnesota.

16:11.709 --> 16:13.798
He has priors for theft
and drug possession.

16:13.885 --> 16:16.323
He lives with his mom
in Cedar Riverside.

16:16.410 --> 16:18.194
OK. What if robbery is
the motive here?

16:18.281 --> 16:19.674
Maybe Osman knew about
the nikah

16:19.761 --> 16:21.241
and knew that there would be
a dowry there.

16:21.328 --> 16:22.764
Would they give it to Sabrina?
- Yes.

16:22.851 --> 16:25.114
The dowry always goes to
the bride.

16:25.201 --> 16:27.377
So if Osman knew that,
he could've waited Hassan out,

16:27.464 --> 16:28.596
killed him,
and stashed the money.

16:28.683 --> 16:29.945
Yeah, but why take Sabrina?

16:30.032 --> 16:31.207
I don't know yet,
but this is our guy.

16:31.294 --> 16:32.861
Hana and Ray,
do a deep dive on him.

16:32.948 --> 16:35.168
Agent Mohamed and Barnes,
with me to Osman's place.

16:35.255 --> 16:36.082
Find that imam from the nikah.

16:36.169 --> 16:37.605
See if he knows
anything helpful.

16:48.877 --> 16:51.706
This place is a dump.

17:07.722 --> 17:09.115
Sorry it's gotta be like this, shorty.

17:10.420 --> 17:12.292
You're staying here.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.051
It's me.

17:32.138 --> 17:34.096
Package has been delivered.

17:35.793 --> 17:38.405
Kristin got nothing from
the imam at the nikah.

17:38.492 --> 17:41.669
- He won't talk?
- Not really a fan of ours.

17:48.719 --> 17:50.069
We're looking for your son, Osman.

17:50.156 --> 17:51.853
Is he here?
- No.

17:51.940 --> 17:54.116
Do you mind if we come in
and take a look around?

18:08.957 --> 18:10.524
So what did Osman do
this time?

18:10.611 --> 18:11.960
We found your son's
fingerprints

18:12.047 --> 18:13.831
at a crime scene last night

18:13.918 --> 18:16.617
where a man was killed and
a 14-year-old girl was taken.

18:16.704 --> 18:17.966
My God.

18:18.053 --> 18:19.359
Clear.

18:19.446 --> 18:21.100
He's not here.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.798
- Do you know where Osman is?
- I don't.

18:23.885 --> 18:26.583
- Did he come home last night?
- I don't think so.

18:26.670 --> 18:28.150
Do you know where
he might have been?

18:28.237 --> 18:29.760
I never do anymore.

18:29.847 --> 18:31.197
I tried to get him involved
with the mosque

18:31.284 --> 18:34.069
to make better friends
when his father died.

18:34.156 --> 18:36.941
And just like everything else,
it didn't work.

18:37.028 --> 18:39.335
It feels like
God's not on his side.

18:42.860 --> 18:45.559
I hope your parents tell you
how proud they are of you.

18:45.646 --> 18:49.258
Seeing a young Somali woman
doing something with her life,

18:49.345 --> 18:51.826
a sight I'm proud to see.

18:51.913 --> 18:53.697
We could try
a controlled call.

18:53.784 --> 18:55.525
If you can keep him on
the phone long enough,

18:55.612 --> 18:57.005
we can trace his location.

18:57.092 --> 18:58.093
Can you call him for us?

19:03.316 --> 19:04.534
Her name is Sabrina.

19:04.621 --> 19:07.363
She's 14-years-old,
and Osman has her.

19:07.450 --> 19:08.495
She's got her whole life
ahead of her,

19:08.582 --> 19:10.845
just like your son.

19:10.932 --> 19:12.499
So, please,

19:12.586 --> 19:15.197
help us find Osman
so we can save her.

19:15.284 --> 19:17.504
Just keep him on the phone.

19:17.591 --> 19:19.897
He won't know that
you helped us.

19:27.992 --> 19:29.690
<i>Hey, Ma.</i>

19:29.777 --> 19:32.171
Osman, can you come home
early today?

19:32.258 --> 19:35.086
I need some help
moving furniture.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.436
<i>I'll come later.</i>

19:36.523 --> 19:38.264
Bring another friend
to help you, too.

19:38.351 --> 19:39.569
<i>OK, OK.</i>

19:39.656 --> 19:42.137
OK, I got him.
He's at a gym in New Hope.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.617
I know that one.

19:43.704 --> 19:44.574
Just keep him on the phone.

19:44.661 --> 19:46.446
Don't let him get suspicious.

19:46.533 --> 19:48.709
<i>Ma, you OK?</i>

19:48.796 --> 19:50.014
Yes.

20:01.635 --> 20:04.464
Black Dodge Charger.
Plates are registered to Osman.

20:04.551 --> 20:06.248
Barnes, search the car,
cover this exit.

20:06.335 --> 20:08.163
Everyone else, inside on coms.

20:12.733 --> 20:14.604
- Ball in.
- All right, here we go.

20:14.691 --> 20:16.563
- Hey, watch the wing.
- Danny, push it.

20:16.650 --> 20:18.086
- Come on, come on.
- Over here!

20:24.832 --> 20:27.182
You two, take that group
in the back.

20:29.663 --> 20:31.360
Looks like cops.

20:41.065 --> 20:42.937
FBI, stop!

20:46.506 --> 20:48.551
Go, go, go, go, go!

21:08.484 --> 21:10.007
He's headed out of
the parking lot, going east.

21:10.094 --> 21:11.531
Almost there.

21:44.781 --> 21:46.087
Hey!

21:47.654 --> 21:49.046
Stop where you are!

21:49.133 --> 21:50.439
Do not move!

21:50.526 --> 21:52.963
Get down on the ground
right now!

21:53.050 --> 21:55.096
Right now, Osman.

21:55.183 --> 21:57.533
On the ground.

21:57.620 --> 22:01.189
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

22:01.276 --> 22:03.844
Show me your hands!

22:03.931 --> 22:06.150
Right now!

22:06.237 --> 22:09.066
Osman, show me your hands!

22:39.314 --> 22:40.620
Nothing on Osman's body

22:40.707 --> 22:41.751
except his wallet
and some weed.

22:41.838 --> 22:42.839
You find his phone in the car?

22:42.926 --> 22:43.840
No, the whole thing's clean

22:43.927 --> 22:45.189
and no sign of Sabrina either.

22:45.276 --> 22:46.669
He was using a 9-millimeter

22:46.756 --> 22:48.018
with the serial number
scratched off.

22:48.105 --> 22:50.891
Casings at the hotel
crime scene were also from a 9.

22:50.978 --> 22:52.283
Doubt that's a coincidence.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.850
So he probably used that
to kill Hassan.

22:53.937 --> 22:55.548
But we got no Sabrina and
no trace of the dowry money.

22:55.635 --> 22:56.723
So what the hell's
going on here?

22:56.810 --> 22:58.768
He could've stashed it.

22:58.855 --> 23:00.944
Maybe he's not working alone.

23:01.031 --> 23:03.599
The crew Osman was hanging
out with is 26 Cedar Squad.

23:03.686 --> 23:05.035
They're a gang based out of
Cedar-Riverside,

23:05.122 --> 23:07.037
A.K.A Little Mogadishu,

23:07.124 --> 23:08.996
a neighborhood that's mostly Somali.

23:09.083 --> 23:11.259
They got busted last year for
a huge sex-trafficking ring.

23:11.346 --> 23:12.956
Sex-trafficking?

23:13.043 --> 23:15.350
OK, so maybe she was being
pimped out after all.

23:15.437 --> 23:17.308
Get with the local
US Attorney's Office.

23:17.396 --> 23:18.788
Go through every
sex-trafficking case

23:18.875 --> 23:21.748
against 26 Cedar Squad
in the last five years.

23:21.835 --> 23:23.184
See if there's any connection
between the high school

23:23.271 --> 23:25.273
and the Abdirashids.
- Got you.

23:29.886 --> 23:31.148
<i>Please record your message.</i>

23:31.235 --> 23:33.629
Hey, it's me again.

23:33.716 --> 23:36.415
This isn't
what I signed up for.

23:36.502 --> 23:39.026
I don't want
any blood on my hands,

23:39.113 --> 23:41.245
so I'm out.

23:41.332 --> 23:42.725
You're on your own.

23:51.778 --> 23:53.432
As you already know,

23:53.519 --> 23:56.260
Naima is Hassan's first wife.

23:56.347 --> 23:58.262
And he's left behind a boy.

23:58.349 --> 24:03.746
We're here to get, um...

24:03.833 --> 24:05.705
I want my husband's
dowry back.

24:05.792 --> 24:07.402
That's not allowed.

24:07.489 --> 24:10.013
Dowry is a gift to Sabrina
from Hassan.

24:10.100 --> 24:11.537
My husband is dead,

24:11.624 --> 24:14.235
and I have nothing to care for
my son with.

24:17.238 --> 24:20.241
I don't know how I'll make
our next mortgage payment.

24:20.328 --> 24:21.634
I need this money.

24:24.114 --> 24:25.812
Imam, tell your father,

24:25.899 --> 24:30.120
charity goes a long way
in this world and in the next.

24:31.818 --> 24:34.081
Leave my home, now.

24:38.694 --> 24:40.130
My husband is dead because of
your whore daughter.

24:40.217 --> 24:41.828
She did this!

24:41.915 --> 24:43.743
Don't you ever say that
about my daughter.

24:43.830 --> 24:45.135
Get out!

24:53.622 --> 24:56.625
Did Sabrina know about
her dowry?

24:56.712 --> 24:58.235
Did she?

24:58.322 --> 24:59.585
Do not raise your voice
at me.

24:59.672 --> 25:02.239
The dowry belongs to her
and only her.

25:02.326 --> 25:04.285
It's God's way of protecting
the bride.

25:04.372 --> 25:05.678
I know that.

25:05.765 --> 25:07.244
If you're not gonna give it
to Sabrina,

25:07.331 --> 25:08.855
then give it to Naima.
It's the right thing to do.

25:08.942 --> 25:10.421
Let it go, son.

25:10.509 --> 25:11.945
I will not, Aabo.

25:12.032 --> 25:13.686
If you won't listen to me
then I demand

25:13.773 --> 25:15.035
you take counsel with
the elders.

25:20.693 --> 25:22.390
As you say.

25:28.570 --> 25:31.007
I, uh--I took your advice.

25:31.094 --> 25:33.357
I asked Cora out.

25:33.444 --> 25:34.837
We have dinner reservations
on Tuesday.

25:34.924 --> 25:37.840
- Oh, good for you.
- Thank you.

25:37.927 --> 25:39.102
There is a, uh--
a small problem, though.

25:39.189 --> 25:40.713
Hmm.

25:40.800 --> 25:43.803
She doesn't have anybody to
watch her son, so...

25:46.675 --> 25:47.850
Ray, I'm not your babysitter.

25:47.937 --> 25:49.548
I know. I know.

25:49.635 --> 25:52.289
It's just--you know, look,
Caleb's a good kid, you know?

25:52.376 --> 25:56.511
All you got to do is throw on
a movie, pop some popcorn.

25:56.598 --> 25:58.426
Please.

26:00.863 --> 26:03.300
- I'll think about it.
- Thank you.

26:03.387 --> 26:04.998
How's it coming with those
case files? Anything?

26:05.085 --> 26:07.130
Yeah, we were just about to
call you.

26:07.217 --> 26:09.872
Cedar Squad has 22
convictions for sex-trafficking

26:09.959 --> 26:11.874
in the last five years.

26:11.961 --> 26:13.572
All of the victims were
Somali women,

26:13.659 --> 26:14.747
and most of them were underage.

26:14.834 --> 26:17.097
- Vulnerable targets?
- Yeah.

26:17.184 --> 26:19.142
Now, the first bust was
a bunch of low-level guys,

26:19.229 --> 26:21.362
but last year, they finally
got the ringleader, all right?

26:21.449 --> 26:23.407
Fareh Highly, 42,

26:23.494 --> 26:25.148
graduated from
the University of Minnesota

26:25.235 --> 26:26.802
with a degree in engineering.

26:26.889 --> 26:28.369
Currently in prison
in St. Cloud.

26:28.456 --> 26:30.023
How is this pertinent?

26:30.110 --> 26:31.981
All of the victims were
also refugees.

26:32.068 --> 26:34.157
Now, they all used the same
resettlement place

26:34.244 --> 26:36.029
as Sabrina's family,

26:36.116 --> 26:38.292
Born of Hope Resettlement
in Maplewood.

26:38.379 --> 26:41.164
The executive director
is Walter McGee.

26:41.251 --> 26:42.949
He also went to
the University of Minnesota

26:43.036 --> 26:44.690
at the same time as
Fareh Highly.

26:44.777 --> 26:45.778
You think they were
working together?

26:45.865 --> 26:47.780
It's definitely
a possibility.

26:47.867 --> 26:48.998
So McGee supplies him with
these women

26:49.085 --> 26:50.391
he's supposed to be helping?

26:50.478 --> 26:51.958
And then the gangs pay him
for his services.

26:52.045 --> 26:53.437
Unbelievable.

26:53.524 --> 26:55.135
I also looked into
dead Osman's bank account.

26:55.222 --> 26:56.658
His balance is negative.

26:56.745 --> 26:58.573
Now, that dowry money had to
have gone somewhere.

26:58.660 --> 27:01.228
It was $100,000 in cash.

27:01.315 --> 27:03.012
You can't deposit that
in the bank.

27:03.099 --> 27:05.406
Probably not. But still,
I'm gonna send Kristin anyway.

27:05.493 --> 27:06.973
This is a hell of a lot more
promising than

27:07.060 --> 27:07.843
tracking down people
from the wedding.

27:07.930 --> 27:09.715
- It's called a nikah.
- A nikah.

27:09.802 --> 27:11.542
I knew that.
I was just testing you.

27:11.630 --> 27:12.718
Right.

27:16.896 --> 27:20.247
Mr. McGee.
Agent Gaines, FBI.

27:20.334 --> 27:21.640
If you want to talk to Walter,

27:21.727 --> 27:23.729
it's going to be through me.
I'm his attorney.

27:23.816 --> 27:25.731
Guilty conscience, Walter?

27:25.818 --> 27:27.384
He hasn't done
anything wrong.

27:27.471 --> 27:29.343
Good.
Then I'll cut straight to it.

27:29.430 --> 27:30.779
Where's Sabrina?

27:30.866 --> 27:32.346
I don't know.

27:32.433 --> 27:33.869
- You don't know?
- Look.

27:33.956 --> 27:36.916
All Walter did was try to
help a young girl

27:37.003 --> 27:38.613
resettle to a better home

27:38.700 --> 27:40.267
to give her
a better quality of life.

27:40.354 --> 27:41.572
He's not a criminal.

27:41.660 --> 27:42.878
We were just about to
contact you

27:42.965 --> 27:46.186
to tell you everything
that's going on.

27:46.273 --> 27:47.578
Isn't that great?
It's your lucky day,

27:47.666 --> 27:51.234
'cause here I am. So go ahead.

27:51.321 --> 27:54.194
I was hired

27:54.281 --> 27:58.459
to save Sabrina from
being a child bride.

27:58.546 --> 28:01.462
She was supposed
to be delivered to me today

28:01.549 --> 28:05.335
at an arranged location along
with my resettlement fee.

28:05.422 --> 28:07.642
I found a family for her
in Seattle.

28:07.729 --> 28:10.253
She would have been fine.

28:10.340 --> 28:12.865
But then when I saw the guy
she was being married to

28:12.952 --> 28:15.868
got killed and--
and she had been kidnapped,

28:15.955 --> 28:17.826
I called the whole thing off.

28:17.913 --> 28:19.045
I swear.

28:19.132 --> 28:21.264
I didn't have anything
to do with this.

28:21.351 --> 28:24.572
All I wanted to do was
help Sabrina, not hurt her.

28:24.659 --> 28:25.486
All right, well,
if you're telling the truth,

28:25.573 --> 28:27.009
I need to two things

28:27.096 --> 28:29.142
and I need to know them
right now.

28:29.229 --> 28:31.840
Where is this location,
and who hired you?

28:50.424 --> 28:52.426
Mom?
- Sabrina.

28:52.513 --> 28:53.253
What is going on?

28:53.340 --> 28:54.689
It's OK.

28:54.776 --> 28:55.908
How did you find me?

28:55.995 --> 28:57.300
It's OK, Hooyo.

28:57.387 --> 28:58.911
It's OK. You're safe now.

29:08.964 --> 29:11.401
Middle of nowhere, no cars.

29:11.488 --> 29:13.142
You sure this is
the right place?

29:13.229 --> 29:14.927
McGee told Kristin
this is it.

29:15.014 --> 29:17.843
Apparently, Mariam texted him
the address yesterday.

29:17.930 --> 29:20.062
- Mariam still not answering?
- It keeps going to voicemail.

29:20.149 --> 29:22.021
Hopefully we're not too late.

29:26.199 --> 29:28.418
FBI, open up!

29:28.505 --> 29:29.593
Anyone in there?

29:39.560 --> 29:41.475
Clear.

29:52.965 --> 29:54.444
Bathroom's clear.

29:54.531 --> 29:56.925
Bedroom, too.

29:57.012 --> 29:58.144
What do you got?

29:58.231 --> 30:00.015
It's what they held her with.

30:00.102 --> 30:03.540
Someone must've used
that hammer to bust her out.

30:03.627 --> 30:05.194
- You think it was her mom?
- Had to be.

30:05.281 --> 30:06.456
She's the only one who knew

30:06.543 --> 30:10.373
Sabrina would be here
besides McGee.

30:10.460 --> 30:12.288
Tied to this fireplace,

30:12.375 --> 30:13.768
all alone at night
in this dump?

30:13.855 --> 30:15.552
Come on.

30:17.076 --> 30:18.729
Mariam's phone.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.122
Why leave it behind?

30:20.209 --> 30:20.993
Because they're on the run now.

30:21.080 --> 30:22.777
- From who?
- I don't know.

30:22.864 --> 30:25.780
But whatever plan Mariam had
for Sabrina to get to Seattle

30:25.867 --> 30:29.392
went to hell in a hand basket
when McGee dropped out.

30:29.479 --> 30:31.351
She's improvising now,
probably panicked, too.

30:31.438 --> 30:33.309
Tell State Police to set
a ten mile perimeter.

30:33.396 --> 30:34.702
I'm gonna talk to the family

30:34.789 --> 30:36.138
to see if they know
where Mariam's going.

30:38.619 --> 30:40.751
You all right?

30:40.839 --> 30:43.145
Can't help but think about
my own daughter.

30:43.232 --> 30:44.320
I know she's a lot younger,

30:44.407 --> 30:46.801
but still.
- Yeah.

30:46.888 --> 30:48.890
We see the worst of humanity
doing this job.

30:48.977 --> 30:50.196
It's hard not to think about

30:50.283 --> 30:52.502
the people we love
going through this.

30:52.589 --> 30:54.940
Sabrina must be terrified
right now.

31:01.424 --> 31:03.862
Mom, slow down.
You just missed the turn.

31:03.949 --> 31:05.559
We're not going home.

31:05.646 --> 31:07.430
What? Why not?

31:07.517 --> 31:08.954
Because the cops know
what I did,

31:09.041 --> 31:10.346
and they're looking for me now.

31:10.433 --> 31:12.218
What are you talking about?
What did you do?

31:12.305 --> 31:13.262
I'll explain
when we get there.

31:13.349 --> 31:14.437
Where are we going?

31:14.524 --> 31:16.004
I have a plan, Sabrina!

31:16.091 --> 31:17.658
Just let me focus now.

31:22.315 --> 31:24.752
Just hang on.

31:24.839 --> 31:26.754
It's not far.

31:37.025 --> 31:39.549
Levan?

31:39.636 --> 31:40.986
Mariam?

31:50.734 --> 31:51.605
Kitchen's clear.

31:53.694 --> 31:55.174
Bedroom's clear.

31:55.261 --> 31:56.349
Somebody was
looking for something.

31:56.436 --> 31:58.177
It must be important.

32:00.614 --> 32:02.137
Gibson.

32:07.055 --> 32:08.448
Imam.

32:10.015 --> 32:11.407
What's going on? You all right?

32:11.494 --> 32:13.235
What happened?
- My father locked me in here

32:13.322 --> 32:15.150
after we got into an argument.

32:15.237 --> 32:16.935
- He made all this mess?
- Yes.

32:17.022 --> 32:18.980
When we got home, my father
went looking for the dowry

32:19.067 --> 32:20.068
but it was gone.

32:20.155 --> 32:21.809
He thinks my mother took it

32:21.896 --> 32:23.463
and that she had something to
do with Sabrina's abduction.

32:23.550 --> 32:25.726
He's right,
at least about the abduction.

32:25.813 --> 32:27.249
Do you know where
she is right now?

32:27.336 --> 32:30.035
No, but we need to find
my father first.

32:30.122 --> 32:31.297
He has a gun,

32:31.384 --> 32:32.254
and I'm afraid
he'll go through with

32:32.341 --> 32:34.430
the elders' advice...

32:34.517 --> 32:35.997
to honor kill Sabrina.

32:46.181 --> 32:47.443
I need it right away. Thanks.

32:47.530 --> 32:48.967
BOLO's out on Mariam's car

32:49.054 --> 32:50.359
and Imam's car that
his father took.

32:50.446 --> 32:52.361
Barnes and Kristin just left
Derrick's house.

32:52.448 --> 32:54.363
He hasn't seen or heard from Sabrina.

32:54.450 --> 32:56.496
We got Mariam and Sabrina on
the no-fly list.

32:56.583 --> 32:58.411
We're covered in the air.

32:58.498 --> 33:00.935
I need to know exactly
what I'm dealing with here.

33:01.022 --> 33:03.677
How do honor killings work?

33:03.764 --> 33:06.723
The Islamic definition refers
to extralegal punishment.

33:06.810 --> 33:08.769
Some believe severe punishment
in this life means

33:08.856 --> 33:10.075
mercy in the next.

33:10.162 --> 33:11.380
But the truth is,
Islamic clerics think

33:11.467 --> 33:13.513
it's barbaric
and cruelly inhumane.

33:13.600 --> 33:14.775
So let me get this straight.

33:14.862 --> 33:16.168
Your father was triggered
when he found out

33:16.255 --> 33:17.473
your mother went over his head

33:17.560 --> 33:19.693
and stopped Sabrina from
being with Hassan.

33:19.780 --> 33:22.000
And now, he thinks he's doing
Sabrina a favor by killing her?

33:22.087 --> 33:23.653
He justifies it by claiming

33:23.740 --> 33:25.394
she'll have mercy
in the next life.

33:25.481 --> 33:26.961
But the truth is,
he's still really mad

33:27.048 --> 33:28.223
Sabrina was with Derrick.

33:28.310 --> 33:30.182
A man not permissible
to Sabrina.

33:30.269 --> 33:30.791
Yes.

33:30.878 --> 33:32.532
I found them.

33:32.619 --> 33:34.229
Levan put a Bluetooth tracker
on Mariam's car.

33:34.316 --> 33:35.883
They're near
Gull Lake in Brainerd.

33:35.970 --> 33:37.276
Get SWAT and a chopper.

33:37.363 --> 33:39.321
We need to get there
before Levan does.

33:42.629 --> 33:46.328
When we came to America,
your father made me a promise

33:46.415 --> 33:49.288
to always do
what's best for you

33:49.375 --> 33:52.291
and to not marry you off
at such a young age,

33:52.378 --> 33:56.121
especially to someone
you don't love.

33:56.208 --> 33:59.907
But when he saw you with
Derrick, he changed.

33:59.994 --> 34:01.517
He broke his promise

34:01.604 --> 34:06.870
and married you off to Hassan
against my wishes.

34:06.957 --> 34:11.484
So, it was me
who had you kidnapped.

34:11.571 --> 34:13.094
What?

34:13.181 --> 34:15.401
Your father's
a dangerous man, Sabrina.

34:15.488 --> 34:18.360
So I hired that man
to kidnap you

34:18.447 --> 34:19.535
and to take your picture

34:19.622 --> 34:21.407
so he would believe
it was real.

34:21.494 --> 34:22.886
So you thought
I'd just leave home

34:22.973 --> 34:26.064
and go to live with strangers?
- Yes.

34:26.151 --> 34:30.503
Because anywhere is a lot safer
than at home with your father.

34:30.590 --> 34:33.158
But I don't want to go
somewhere else.

34:33.245 --> 34:35.943
I want to stay here
and be with Derrick.

34:36.030 --> 34:38.424
It's too late for that, Hooyo.

34:38.511 --> 34:39.816
I'm sorry.

34:39.903 --> 34:42.036
Where are we gonna go?

34:42.123 --> 34:48.129
I have a plan for that, too.

34:48.216 --> 34:51.654
Your dowry from Hassan,
$100,000 cash.

34:51.741 --> 34:53.178
I don't want it.

34:53.265 --> 34:55.963
This is what will save us, Sabrina.

34:56.050 --> 34:58.400
We can use it to go
far away from here.

34:58.487 --> 35:00.533
I'm not going to let you
end up like I did

35:00.620 --> 35:04.276
when I was married to
your father at 14.

35:04.363 --> 35:06.974
Your whole life is
ahead of you.

35:23.208 --> 35:24.426
Go.

35:24.513 --> 35:26.124
Run into the woods
and don't look back.

35:26.211 --> 35:28.256
Do you hear me?
- What is going on?

35:28.343 --> 35:30.519
It's your father.
He's found us.

35:30.606 --> 35:32.391
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

35:32.478 --> 35:33.914
You're the bravest
person I know.

35:36.873 --> 35:38.484
I love you.

35:38.571 --> 35:40.747
I always will.

35:59.940 --> 36:01.376
Where is Sabrina?

36:01.463 --> 36:03.161
I'll never let you
hurt her again.

36:10.080 --> 36:13.345
All you had to do was let
her live in peace with Hassan.

36:13.432 --> 36:15.608
What do you know about peace?

36:15.695 --> 36:17.262
Have you not seen how unhappy
I've been

36:17.349 --> 36:19.960
the last 26 years
married to you?

36:20.047 --> 36:22.789
I won't let that happen to me
or to Sabrina ever again.

36:22.876 --> 36:24.094
Where is she?

36:24.182 --> 36:25.922
I'm not telling you.

36:26.009 --> 36:27.402
I won't ask again.

36:29.709 --> 36:31.363
Where's my daughter?

36:31.450 --> 36:32.407
No.

36:44.202 --> 36:45.855
May Allah have mercy on you.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.005
We should've
just arrested Levan.

37:05.092 --> 37:07.225
No regrets.

37:07.312 --> 37:08.748
We're here now.
That's all that matters.

37:08.835 --> 37:09.923
Barn's clear.

37:10.010 --> 37:11.838
This is Levan's car.

37:13.753 --> 37:15.058
We got footprints over here.

37:15.145 --> 37:16.321
He's heading into the woods.

37:16.408 --> 37:18.627
Circle around.
You two, with me.

37:25.417 --> 37:27.419
Please, forgive my daughter.

37:27.506 --> 37:29.421
Have mercy on her.

37:29.508 --> 37:32.511
Please don't do this.

37:32.598 --> 37:35.514
Aabo, please!

37:38.212 --> 37:39.866
This will erase your sin.

37:39.953 --> 37:41.998
Please.

37:42.085 --> 37:43.609
Please.

37:45.393 --> 37:46.873
Put the gun down, Levan!

37:48.744 --> 37:50.093
Think hard about
what you're doing.

37:53.532 --> 37:56.056
She disrespected God and me.

37:56.143 --> 37:58.406
And now everyone knows!

37:58.493 --> 38:00.495
This is the only way forward.

38:00.582 --> 38:03.106
The only way to reclaim
her innocence.

38:03.193 --> 38:06.545
She's just a child,
your child.

38:06.632 --> 38:08.895
- I'm saving her.
- That's not true.

38:08.982 --> 38:10.200
You're executing her.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.028
Stop telling me
how to handle my child!

38:12.115 --> 38:14.248
Honor killing is forbidden.

38:14.335 --> 38:16.206
It's not Islamic law.

38:16.294 --> 38:19.949
He's right.
Remember God's words:

38:20.036 --> 38:23.779
"If you killed one, it's as if
you killed all of humanity."

38:37.706 --> 38:40.666
Allah,
please forgive my daughter.

38:40.753 --> 38:42.102
He's praying.
He's gonna kill her.

38:42.189 --> 38:44.234
Let us reunite
in the highest heaven.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.628
Have mercy on her.

38:46.715 --> 38:48.108
Levan, don't do this.

38:51.851 --> 38:53.113
I'm saving her.

38:53.200 --> 38:55.115
Drop your weapon
and surrender.

38:59.206 --> 39:00.250
I have to do this.

39:30.498 --> 39:33.588
- Poor girl.
- I couldn't imagine.

39:39.594 --> 39:43.859
Sabrina, she has to go now.

39:43.946 --> 39:45.383
I don't want to leave her.

39:45.470 --> 39:47.602
Sweetie,
you can be with her later.

39:47.689 --> 39:50.213
Come on.

40:10.451 --> 40:12.714
Dinner was amazing.

40:12.801 --> 40:15.282
I don't eat out much anymore,
so thanks for that.

40:15.369 --> 40:17.632
Yeah, well,
it was my pleasure.

40:17.719 --> 40:23.421
I thought it was
pretty great, too.

40:23.508 --> 40:25.292
You want a little Irish
for your coffee?

40:25.379 --> 40:25.988
Where did you get that?

40:27.860 --> 40:30.079
I picked it up
on my way to get you.

40:30.166 --> 40:32.604
I figured you'd be the type
of woman

40:32.691 --> 40:35.911
that would say yes to
a unique experience.

40:35.998 --> 40:37.957
And I thought this would
liven it up a bit.

40:38.044 --> 40:40.525
OK, I like it.

40:44.790 --> 40:46.835
You know, I have lived here
for ten years

40:46.922 --> 40:51.187
and I have never done
anything like this.

40:51.274 --> 40:52.450
It's nice.

40:52.537 --> 40:54.321
One thing I like about
New York, though.

40:54.408 --> 40:56.497
You know, there's almost, like,
too much stuff to do here.

40:56.584 --> 40:57.977
Mm-hmm.

40:58.064 --> 41:00.240
Feel like I'm barely
scratching the surface.

41:00.327 --> 41:01.241
You ever miss New Orleans?

41:01.328 --> 41:03.722
It's always gonna be home.

41:03.809 --> 41:06.028
Can't beat New York.

41:07.682 --> 41:09.597
Oh, shoot, hold on a second.

41:11.556 --> 41:13.383
It's Hana.

41:13.471 --> 41:16.125
"Caleb's sound asleep,
everything is good.

41:16.212 --> 41:18.867
Do not rush home."

41:18.954 --> 41:21.479
What'd she do?
She drug him or something?

41:21.566 --> 41:22.958
She's got special powers,
all right?

41:23.045 --> 41:25.004
She must.

41:25.091 --> 41:26.875
I want to show you something.

41:26.962 --> 41:29.530
- What? What?
- Don't ask questions.

41:29.617 --> 41:30.966
Just--just come on. Come on.
- What are you doing?

41:31.053 --> 41:33.926
It's raining.

41:34.013 --> 41:36.929
Oh!

41:37.016 --> 41:39.671
Oh, woo.

41:39.758 --> 41:43.283
Oh, wow.

41:43.370 --> 41:44.980
It's beautiful.

41:45.067 --> 41:46.155
It is.

41:49.594 --> 41:52.510
So, still want to stay out?

41:52.597 --> 41:54.207
I know a dope little spot
around my neighborhood

41:54.294 --> 41:55.295
where we can get
a little nightcap.

41:55.382 --> 41:57.602
- Um, it depends.
- On what?

41:57.689 --> 41:59.560
On how our first kiss goes.

41:59.647 --> 42:01.867
Ah.

42:01.954 --> 42:03.042
OK.

42:03.129 --> 42:04.304
Yeah.

42:12.268 --> 42:13.705
Nah, take me home.

42:13.792 --> 42:15.533
- What, really?
- Yes

42:15.620 --> 42:17.012
Oh, come on.
That was-- that was good.

42:17.099 --> 42:18.100
Yeah, that was maybe a seven.

42:18.187 --> 42:19.493
- A seven?
- Yeah.

42:19.580 --> 42:20.886
- Really?
- No.

42:20.973 --> 42:26.326
I'm just giving you
a hard time.

42:26.413 --> 42:29.329
- We'll get a nightcap.
- Ah.
