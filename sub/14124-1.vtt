Hey, sarge.

02:17.513 --> 02:19.472
He's so drunk.

02:29.566 --> 02:31.943
Oh, what a shame, he's drunk.

They still hate you.

04:43.742 --> 04:47.536
You can put your arms down when the
search team finishes with you.

04:47.746 --> 04:52.708
We don't want anybody from this fort
going into Tynin looking for rednecks.

04:52.918 --> 04:55.002
- May I speak, sir?
- Cobb?

04:55.212 --> 04:58.047
Nivens must know nobody
colored killed the sarge.

04:58.256 --> 05:00.174
Well, this is
precautionary, Cobb.

05:00.384 --> 05:03.594
We can't have the Army
engaged in revenge on civilians.

05:03.804 --> 05:07.431
Sir. Are there any suspects, sir?
None.

05:07.641 --> 05:11.435
Oh, come on, now. Everybody
knows it was the Klan.

05:12.604 --> 05:14.563
Were you
an eyewitness, soldier?

05:14.731 --> 05:16.983
They lynched Jefferson
the week I got here.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.193
Two weeks after that, it was...
Henson.

05:19.403 --> 05:22.196
Unless you saw it,
keep your opinions to yourself.

05:22.406 --> 05:23.990
Yes, sir.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.827
And that applies
to everybody else.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.328
Yes, sir.

05:29.538 --> 05:32.498
Tynin has been placed off-limits
to all enlisted personnel.

05:32.666 --> 05:36.585
Oh, come on, captain.
Any man found in the town

05:36.795 --> 05:39.672
will be immediately subject
to court-martial.

05:40.465 --> 05:43.968
Sergeant Waters' replacement will
be assigned in a couple of weeks.

05:44.177 --> 05:48.806
Until then, Cobb,
you're barracks NCO.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.891
Any questions?

05:52.602 --> 05:54.270
Carry on.

05:57.941 --> 06:01.444
Now, what you think?

06:01.611 --> 06:05.072
Taylor and that goddamn colonel,
they know who killed Waters.

06:05.282 --> 06:07.783
Anybody feel like playing
me in some pitty-pat?

06:07.993 --> 06:10.119
I thought all you could
play was flunky.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.412
Yeah.

06:11.621 --> 06:15.332
Wilkie, whose ass you gonna kiss now
that your number one ass is dead?

06:15.542 --> 06:18.669
You know what you can do for me, Henson.
You too, Peterson.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.881
Take it easy.
I'm the one who lost three stripes.

06:22.090 --> 06:25.551
I'm the only man here with kids.
When the man said jump, I jumped.

06:25.761 --> 06:29.305
Come on, don't put your wife and
kids between you and Waters' ass.

06:29.514 --> 06:32.892
I don't kiss nobody's ass, Henson.
I just wanted my stripes back.

06:33.101 --> 06:35.186
Never been no place,
never had nothing.

06:35.395 --> 06:40.066
You can't understand a man like me.
I was a top sergeant of this platoon.

06:40.275 --> 06:44.570
Yeah? Well, now you ain't nothing.
Nothing, Wilkie.

07:06.718 --> 07:09.011
- Recruits, over here.
- Let me see your passes.

07:09.221 --> 07:11.347
Let's go. Let's go.

07:18.438 --> 07:22.149
Hey, wake up. Wake up, boy.

07:22.359 --> 07:24.068
You said Tynin, didn't you?

07:25.487 --> 07:27.404
Yeah, yeah. Ahem. Yeah.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.698
Come on, boy.

07:30.909 --> 07:32.451
Let's go.

07:33.537 --> 07:35.538
- Hang on.
- Here we go again.

07:35.747 --> 07:37.414
I'm from Mississippi.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.811
Captain Davenport?

08:02.816 --> 08:05.359
Corporal Ellis
at your disposal, sir.

08:05.569 --> 08:08.154
I'm to take you
to Colonel Nivens, sir.

08:08.363 --> 08:12.199
Well, let's get rolling, soldier.
Yes, sir.

08:19.082 --> 08:23.210
Yes, sir, Captain Davenport.
Yes, sir.

08:23.837 --> 08:26.213
We're rolling, captain.

09:09.257 --> 09:12.635
This is where they killed
Sergeant Waters last month, sir.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.764
Why did you say "they"
killed him, corporal?

09:19.017 --> 09:21.352
- Who's "they"?
- The Klan, sir.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.813
They ain't too crazy about us
tan yanks down here.

09:55.011 --> 09:57.596
I suppose whoever drove
you in from the station

09:57.806 --> 10:00.557
showed you the spot
where the killing took place.

10:00.934 --> 10:04.895
Told you I had all the troops'
personal effects searched for weapons.

10:07.649 --> 10:09.483
He tell you all that?

10:09.818 --> 10:12.778
Is there a point the colonel
is trying to make, sir?

10:13.196 --> 10:14.947
There's a point.

10:16.908 --> 10:20.327
This thing has been blown
all the hell out of shape.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.496
This is the Army's business.

10:22.914 --> 10:24.873
Not the NAACP.

10:25.375 --> 10:26.834
Not the Negro press.

10:27.168 --> 10:30.713
Not those paper-shuffling
desk jockeys in Washington.

10:31.589 --> 10:34.383
I was brought up
in the South, Davenport.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.802
Ever hear of
Threadgill County, Alabama?

10:37.012 --> 10:39.805
No, sir.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.475
No matter.

10:45.145 --> 10:49.273
I've been commanding colored
troops all my life, Davenport.

10:49.607 --> 10:52.818
The worst thing you can do
in this part of the country

10:53.028 --> 10:57.364
is pay attention to death of a Negro
under mysterious circumstances.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.158
Especially a soldier.

10:59.367 --> 11:02.244
People get itchy. Uneasy.

11:02.454 --> 11:06.123
White folk in the town,
colored at the fort.

11:06.708 --> 11:09.084
Keep turning this thing over,

11:09.294 --> 11:13.213
sooner or later, you're bound
to have an explosion.

11:13.548 --> 11:19.303
Now, I've lived here
in Hunter Parish three years.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.930
I'm fond of the place.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.724
I like the duty.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.351
You get my meaning?

11:25.560 --> 11:27.311
What is it you want, colonel?

11:27.520 --> 11:30.814
I want whatever you came here
to do completed in three days.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.525
Sir, I request permission
to notify Washington.

11:33.735 --> 11:35.652
Denied.
I'm under direct orders...

11:35.904 --> 11:38.238
I don't give a damn
if Roosevelt sent you.

11:38.448 --> 11:42.993
I'm trying to prevent my troops from
going into town and killing somebody.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.704
And I don't care what you think.

11:46.122 --> 11:48.040
You can always return
to Washington.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.249
No, sir.

11:49.417 --> 11:53.545
I was assigned this case
and I intend to file a report, sir.

11:58.176 --> 12:00.386
Here are your instructions
and our reports.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.596
Taylor's men
will help you get settled.

12:02.764 --> 12:04.932
Taylor was Waters' CO.

12:05.141 --> 12:06.725
That'll be all, Davenport.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.069
Oh, and, captain?

12:17.737 --> 12:19.321
Remember,

12:19.489 --> 12:22.866
you're the first colored officer
most of these men have seen.

12:23.535 --> 12:27.162
The Army expects you to set
an example for the colored troops

12:27.372 --> 12:29.748
and be a credit to your race.

12:30.333 --> 12:33.794
Is that clear, captain?

12:35.088 --> 12:37.965
Yes, colonel.

12:43.054 --> 12:44.596
Sir.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.516
Sir, you all right?

12:47.725 --> 12:51.019
You like to go to your quarters?
No, I'll see Captain Taylor.

12:51.229 --> 12:54.440
You don't wanna unpack, sir?
Freshen up? Didn't go too good?

12:54.607 --> 12:58.444
You got a hearing problem?
No, sir. I was born with big ears.

12:58.653 --> 13:01.572
It runs in my family.
My grandmother had big ears...

13:21.593 --> 13:24.178
I used to drive
a fire truck, captain.

13:24.387 --> 13:27.598
Then the Army took and let
me drive an ambulance.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.893
I've been driving this jeep
for six months, sir.

13:31.102 --> 13:33.520
Only turned over twice.

13:34.272 --> 13:36.523
- Twice?
- Yes, sir.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.067
Good.

14:08.306 --> 14:10.516
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon, sir.

14:18.566 --> 14:21.485
Sergeant Washington, sir.
Can I help you, captain?

14:21.694 --> 14:23.904
Captain Davenport
to see Captain Taylor.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.241
Just a moment, sir.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.953
Yes?

14:31.162 --> 14:34.164
There's a Captain Davenport
to see you, sir.

14:34.374 --> 14:37.251
- Well, send him in.
- Yes, sir.

14:38.670 --> 14:41.713
Every member of the lodge
is rooting for you, sir.

14:50.348 --> 14:53.642
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

14:53.851 --> 14:56.270
I like your flowers, captain.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.400
Hey, where's he from?

15:01.609 --> 15:03.443
He's from Washington, D.C.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.612
He's here on special assignment.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.072
Washington?

15:07.282 --> 15:08.740
Yes, sir.

15:08.950 --> 15:11.451
You gotta be shitting me.

15:13.121 --> 15:17.499
So they assigned a lawyer
to the military police, eh?

15:17.709 --> 15:20.210
Well, where did you graduate
law school?

15:20.420 --> 15:22.379
Howard University.

15:22.672 --> 15:24.381
Your parents rich or something?

15:24.716 --> 15:26.883
No, my father's a mailman.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.513
I graduated at the Point.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.266
I didn't see any Negroes
at the Point.

15:34.475 --> 15:39.605
In fact, I never saw a Negro
until I was, I think, 12 or 13.

15:39.814 --> 15:41.648
Have you seen
my orders, captain?

15:42.442 --> 15:45.360
Yes, as soon as Colonel
Nivens received them.

15:45.695 --> 15:51.742
Look, I think it only fair to tell you
that had I known you'd be a Negro

15:51.951 --> 15:55.912
I would've requested the immediate
suspension of the investigation.

15:56.122 --> 15:59.583
Now, look, may I speak freely?
You haven't stopped yet.

16:00.418 --> 16:03.962
Look, these local people aren't
gonna charge a white man

16:04.172 --> 16:05.922
in this parish on your say-so.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.633
And Nivens knows that.

16:07.842 --> 16:11.470
He doesn't give a damn about this killing.
Your being here proves it.

16:11.679 --> 16:15.807
Making a fool out of you. Can't you...?
Will you take off those sunglasses?

16:16.017 --> 16:18.935
I like these.
They're like MacArthur's.

16:19.437 --> 16:22.856
All right. Now, look. Let me
explain something to you.

16:23.066 --> 16:24.941
You go near Tynin in uniform,

16:25.109 --> 16:27.736
sounding white
and charging local people,

16:27.904 --> 16:30.364
you're gonna wind up
just as dead as Waters.

16:30.573 --> 16:33.825
This isn't Washington, Davenport.
I know where I am.

16:34.035 --> 16:37.746
Do you know how many times I've asked
Nivens to look into this killing?

16:37.955 --> 16:40.082
Every day since it happened.

16:40.291 --> 16:43.585
Do you suspect someone?
Don't play lawyer with me, soldier.

16:43.795 --> 16:46.880
With you on this case,
we are not gonna get anywhere.

16:47.090 --> 16:49.675
Like it or not, captain.
I am all you've got.

16:49.884 --> 16:52.511
Your orders instruct you
to cooperate.

16:54.389 --> 16:58.350
Now, is there anything else?

16:59.811 --> 17:02.396
- Ellis.
- Yes, sir.

17:02.605 --> 17:05.607
Captain Davenport will need
some assistance with the men.

17:05.817 --> 17:08.402
You'll excuse me, captain?
Oh, I'm glad I met you.

17:10.655 --> 17:12.571
Captain.

17:24.001 --> 17:26.420
I sure hope we get
to fight soon, sir.

17:26.628 --> 17:29.339
Next, they'll have us picking
this year's cotton crop.

17:29.507 --> 17:32.634
Don't worry, they don't grow
a lot of cotton in Germany.

17:32.844 --> 17:34.636
Yes, sir.

17:37.932 --> 17:40.600
How long was Captain Taylor's
investigation?

17:40.977 --> 17:42.018
Two days, sir.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.771
Two days? Who did he question?

17:45.148 --> 17:48.024
Well, mostly guys who had
contact with sarge that day.

17:48.234 --> 17:51.820
Guys in his platoon, then anybody
who could've seen him on the road.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.447
Wasn't but a handful.

17:53.656 --> 17:56.324
- Did you see him that day?
- Nope.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.493
No, sir.

18:24.270 --> 18:27.981
Did your sergeant drink a lot?
I didn't know him well enough, sir.

18:28.191 --> 18:31.234
All right, soldiers, let's
get back to those exercises.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.904
Haven't you ever seen
a colored officer before?

18:34.113 --> 18:36.531
No, sir. Have you, sir?

18:38.242 --> 18:39.659
Ten-hut.

18:46.667 --> 18:47.709
This is it, sir.

18:47.919 --> 18:51.671
The captain instructed everyone in
the sergeant's platoon to be here.

18:53.716 --> 18:55.509
As you were.

19:06.354 --> 19:09.064
Sergeant Waters' room
is right there, sir.

19:09.565 --> 19:13.568
Sir, I think I ought to tell you, sir.

19:13.778 --> 19:18.198
Captain Taylor questioned two white
officers from this fort that night.

19:18.699 --> 19:19.866
How do you know?

19:20.076 --> 19:22.452
I delivered his report
to Colonel Nivens, sir.

19:22.662 --> 19:26.122
And on the way over,
the jeep hit a hole, bam!

19:26.541 --> 19:28.667
And the papers
flew all over the road

19:28.876 --> 19:31.711
and I happened to notice it, sir.
Who are they?

19:31.921 --> 19:33.004
No names, sir.

19:33.214 --> 19:35.298
Just the mentioning
of the questioning.

19:35.466 --> 19:37.551
Seems they were
on the road that night.

19:44.851 --> 19:50.021
Well, don't let any more reports
fly away from you, corporal.

19:50.606 --> 19:51.982
No, sir.

19:54.151 --> 19:56.319
Sir, may I say something,
though?

19:56.696 --> 20:01.241
It sure is good seeing one of
us wearing captain's bars, sir.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.202
Call in the first man, corporal.

20:04.662 --> 20:06.288
Yes, sir.

20:06.789 --> 20:09.249
Private Wilkie,
captain wants to see you.

20:09.458 --> 20:12.878
Yes, indeedy. On my way.

20:15.840 --> 20:18.550
Private Wilkie
reports as ordered, sir.

20:19.427 --> 20:21.052
Close the door.

20:29.020 --> 20:32.230
- Have a seat.
- Yes, sir.

20:36.068 --> 20:39.195
I'm Captain Davenport. I'm conduc...
We all know that, sir.

20:39.405 --> 20:43.575
Word went out on the grapevine you
were here the minute you hit the fort.

20:48.372 --> 20:52.792
I'm conducting an inquiry into the
events surrounding the death of Waters.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.754
The report I file
will be confidential.

20:57.048 --> 20:58.798
How long did you know
the sergeant?

20:59.550 --> 21:01.301
About a year, sir.

21:01.510 --> 21:04.846
You see, this company, sir,
was basically a baseball team.

21:05.056 --> 21:07.766
Most of the guys had played
in the Negro league.

21:07.975 --> 21:10.143
Naturally,
the Army put us all together.

21:10.353 --> 21:14.105
The Army sent Sergeant Waters here
to manage the team, summer of '42,

21:14.315 --> 21:16.650
right after the invasion
of North Africa.

21:16.859 --> 21:20.070
He'd been in field artillery,
a gunnery sergeant.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.948
He had a FEF and an ETO.

21:23.157 --> 21:26.409
A Croix de Guerre
from the First World War.

21:27.703 --> 21:29.579
What kind of man was he?

21:34.502 --> 21:37.837
He was all spit and polish, sir.

21:38.631 --> 21:41.716
He took my stripes, sir,
but I was in the wrong.

21:41.926 --> 21:43.510
Sergeant Wilkie.

21:43.719 --> 21:47.180
You're a noncommissioned officer
in the army of a country at war.

21:47.390 --> 21:50.308
Penalty for being drunk on duty
is severe in peace time.

21:50.518 --> 21:55.105
So don't bring me, "Us colored folks
can't do nothing unless they're drunk."

21:55.314 --> 21:57.273
You're supposed to be
an example.

21:57.692 --> 22:01.486
I'm gonna put you in the stockade
for 10 days and take those stripes.

22:01.696 --> 22:03.822
Wait, sergeant...
To teach you a lesson.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.615
You're in the Army.

22:07.702 --> 22:09.869
Colored folks running off
at the mouth.

22:10.037 --> 22:13.873
What will they do if the white man
give them a chance? What do you do?

22:14.083 --> 22:17.836
You wind up drunk on guard duty.
I don't blame the white man.

22:18.045 --> 22:20.880
Why the hell should he put
colored and white together?

22:21.090 --> 22:23.925
You can't guard your own quarters.
Sergeant...

22:24.135 --> 22:28.179
Where's your pride, soldier? Where's
your respect for this uniform?

22:28.431 --> 22:31.850
Get out of my sight, private.

22:52.079 --> 22:54.247
And how was he
with the other men?

22:54.457 --> 22:56.833
Sometimes the Southern
guys caught hell.

22:57.043 --> 23:00.378
Sergeant wasn't too big
on guys from the South.

23:01.130 --> 23:03.840
Me, I'm from Detroit.

23:04.091 --> 23:07.052
Did you know that Joe Louis
got his start in Detroit?

23:07.470 --> 23:09.304
What about the Southern men?

23:09.513 --> 23:11.931
The sarge didn't like them.
Except for C.J.

23:12.141 --> 23:15.643
It could've been because C.J. was
the best ballplayer on the team.

23:15.853 --> 23:17.812
He could sing too.

23:18.022 --> 23:20.190

24:59.081 --> 25:02.667
Drink up. Mary can't make no money when the U.S.
Army stops sipping.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.836
So drink up now
because I need a new car.

25:07.923 --> 25:09.132
Yeah.

25:09.341 --> 25:12.468
I'm gonna ask that boy
something. Come on, Wilkie.

25:18.559 --> 25:20.476
Hey, boy.

25:21.478 --> 25:23.813
You ever heard
of Blind Willie Reynolds?

25:24.023 --> 25:25.481
From Son House?

25:25.691 --> 25:26.983
I knew it.

25:27.193 --> 25:29.611
I bet you're from
Mississippi too, ain't you?

25:29.820 --> 25:31.154
Yes, sir.

25:31.363 --> 25:36.159
I used to hear him at the Bandana
Club outside Camp J.J. Reilly.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.578
Folks used to come
from everywhere, Wilkie.

25:38.787 --> 25:40.538
Folks would be
dancing, sweating.

25:40.915 --> 25:44.250
Reminded me of a place
I used to go in France.

25:44.418 --> 25:47.503
The whiskey, the women.

25:47.922 --> 25:51.090
Place called the Café Napoléon.

25:51.300 --> 25:55.011
Where did you learn to play, son?
My daddy taught me, sarge.

25:55.221 --> 25:57.096
You play pretty good, boy.

25:58.682 --> 26:00.433
Wilkie, wasn't that good?

26:00.643 --> 26:02.644
Yeah, that was good, sarge.

26:02.853 --> 26:04.729
Take it easy, son.

26:09.735 --> 26:13.238
I mostly agreed with the sergeant, sir.
He was a good man.

26:13.447 --> 26:15.198
Good to his men.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.992
Talked about his wife
and his kid all the time.

26:18.202 --> 26:21.454
As a matter of fact,
he wrote home to his wife every day.

26:21.747 --> 26:25.208
I just don't see why anybody
would wanna kill the sarge.

26:27.378 --> 26:30.463

26:31.006 --> 26:35.301

26:36.971 --> 26:40.515
My wife let a neighbor take this
just a couple of weeks ago.

26:40.808 --> 26:42.642
Army's not for my son.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.645
See, when this war is over,
things are gonna change.

26:45.854 --> 26:48.189
I want him to be ready for it.

26:48.440 --> 26:52.443
I'll send him to some big white college.
Let him rub elbows with the whites.

26:52.611 --> 26:55.071
Learn white man's language,
how he does things.

26:55.281 --> 26:57.240
White don't rub off.

26:57.449 --> 27:00.743
Well, what are we gonna do?
Stay behind in everything?

27:00.953 --> 27:04.956
Hell, you can see it in the Army
. White man's running rings around us.

27:05.291 --> 27:08.293
Lot of us ain't had the chance
them white boys had, sarge.

27:08.502 --> 27:09.836
Oh, that ain't no excuse.

27:10.045 --> 27:12.714
My daddy shoveled coal
from a wagon all his life.

27:12.923 --> 27:15.591
Couldn't read or write,
but he saw that we did.

27:15.801 --> 27:18.303
Now, not having is no excuse
for not getting.

27:18.804 --> 27:21.139
You can't get pee
from a tree, sarge.

27:28.564 --> 27:30.857
You're just like the rest of them,
Wilkie.

27:31.066 --> 27:33.359
Ignorant, scared.

27:33.777 --> 27:36.529
- Stop thinking like a nigger.
- Take it easy.

27:36.739 --> 27:38.781
All I said...
Is the equipment ready?

27:38.991 --> 27:41.451
No.

But deep down, a real nice guy.

28:05.559 --> 28:08.227
You could borrow a 10 from him
if you needed it.

28:08.937 --> 28:11.064
Did you see him
the night he was killed?

28:11.273 --> 28:15.026
I saw him in town at the club earlier.
But I left around 10:00.

28:15.235 --> 28:17.195
He was juicing pretty heavy.

28:17.738 --> 28:19.697
Is it true
that when they found him

28:19.907 --> 28:23.368
his stripes and insignia
were still on the uniform?

28:24.912 --> 28:27.830
Yes.
Something's wrong, ain't it, sir?

28:28.540 --> 28:29.582
Those Klan boys,

28:29.792 --> 28:33.002
they can't stand to see us
in these uniforms.

28:33.212 --> 28:37.090
They usually take the stripes and
stuff off before they lynch us.

28:42.721 --> 28:45.848
That'll be all, private.
Yes, sir.

28:48.519 --> 28:50.728
Can you do anything
about allotment checks?

28:50.938 --> 28:52.939
My wife didn't get hers
last month.

28:54.525 --> 28:56.275
Did you see
the finance officer?

28:56.485 --> 28:59.195
Yes, I did, sir.

28:59.571 --> 29:03.032
Well, I'll speak
to Captain Taylor about it.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.451
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Yes, indeed.

29:05.661 --> 29:07.870
Would you like me
to send the next man in?

29:08.080 --> 29:09.747
Yes.

29:14.169 --> 29:17.755
Private First Class Melvin Peterson,
reporting as ordered, sir.

29:19.508 --> 29:21.467
Sit down, private.

29:34.481 --> 29:35.982
Where are you from, Peterson?

29:36.191 --> 29:38.443
Hollywood, California.

29:39.528 --> 29:41.612
By way of Alabama, sir.

29:41.822 --> 29:45.992
You see, I enlisted in '42. I thought
we'd get a chance to fight, sir.

29:51.165 --> 29:53.291
Did you know the sergeant well?

29:53.500 --> 29:56.335
No. He was with the company
when I got assigned,

29:56.628 --> 29:59.464
and PFCs and sergeants,
we don't mix too well, sir.

29:59.631 --> 30:03.468
You played ball for him.
Oh, yes, sir. I played shortstop.

30:03.677 --> 30:06.471
And did you like the sergeant?
No, sir.

30:06.722 --> 30:09.515
Well, it goes back to the team.
Stoneass felt that...

30:09.725 --> 30:11.142
Stoneass?

30:11.351 --> 30:14.270
I'm the only one who called
him that. Sergeant Waters.

30:15.606 --> 30:17.815
Didn't mean no offense, sir.

30:21.403 --> 30:22.737
By the time I got here,

30:22.905 --> 30:25.615
the team had won
nine or 10 games in a row.

30:25.824 --> 30:29.660
There was even a rumor we'd get to
play the Yankees in exhibition.

30:30.037 --> 30:31.787
Anyway, we were...

30:31.955 --> 30:34.790
We were playing the 35th
Ordinance this particular day.

30:34.958 --> 30:37.126
It was a real big game too.

30:37.586 --> 30:41.631
The YWCA sent a whole
busload of women to see us.

30:42.299 --> 30:45.218
Yes, a real big day, sir.

31:07.115 --> 31:08.658
I can't believe that.

31:10.577 --> 31:12.245
Yeah.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.417
Let it fly again. Let's go, Pete.

31:41.650 --> 31:44.110
Come on, batter. Hit the ball.

31:45.946 --> 31:48.447
That's a hell of a ballplayer.

31:55.497 --> 31:58.040
Come on, hit it.
Throw another one up here.

32:00.294 --> 32:01.752
Come on, C.J., next county.

32:25.402 --> 32:28.070
Hell of a ballplayer.
Did you see...?

32:35.579 --> 32:38.205
- All right, C.J.
- Right on, C.J.

32:42.127 --> 32:43.294
Come on, boy.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.841
Did you see that ball?

32:49.051 --> 32:51.177
Did you see it? Did you see it go?

32:51.970 --> 32:57.266
We played fairly well. I had two hits.
Smalls had a couple and C.J...

32:58.101 --> 33:00.269
C.J. was incredible.

33:01.813 --> 33:04.732
And we beat them something
like nine-, 10-nothing.

33:04.941 --> 33:09.111
Like we always did after, we went
over to the mess hall to celebrate.

33:09.905 --> 33:12.156
Fellas.
It's a big ball, give it back.

33:12.324 --> 33:18.412
C.J. Who was that fine river hip thing
you was talking to before the game?

33:18.622 --> 33:21.415
The woman had tits
like two helmets.

33:21.625 --> 33:24.835
You see the size of them knockers?
No, he didn't.

33:25.045 --> 33:27.630
Smalls couldn't even see
a ball go in his glove.

33:27.839 --> 33:31.133
How the hell he gonna see C.J.?
I saw C.J., man.

33:31.343 --> 33:34.929
Will you all let C.J. tell me
about this woman?

33:35.138 --> 33:37.056
She looked mighty good
to me, C.J.

33:37.265 --> 33:40.309
All she asked me for
was my autograph.

33:40.977 --> 33:43.604
She looked like she was
asking for more than that.

33:43.814 --> 33:45.898
Moved in close.

33:46.108 --> 33:47.775
Breathing heavy.

33:47.984 --> 33:51.904
Waving them tits
all in your face.

33:53.907 --> 33:55.408
He's right on that, C.J.

33:55.617 --> 33:57.993
If I'd given that gal
what she asked me for,

33:58.203 --> 34:00.913
she'd give me something
I didn't want.

34:01.123 --> 34:02.456
Around home,

34:02.666 --> 34:06.544
there's a fella folks used to call
Little Jimmy One-Leg

34:06.753 --> 34:09.213
on account of his thing
was so big.

34:10.090 --> 34:13.926
A couple of years ago,
a young, pretty thing

34:14.136 --> 34:16.387
laid clap on Jimmy so bad

34:16.596 --> 34:18.848
he lost the one good leg he had.

34:19.056 --> 34:20.850
Now folks just call him Little.

34:23.478 --> 34:27.273
You know, that pretty young thing
talking to me ain't look too clean.

34:27.482 --> 34:32.277
Yeah, them dirty ones will give you
the clap every time, right, Henson?

34:36.742 --> 34:40.494
I hear tell they're on the verge
of getting all of us together.

34:40.704 --> 34:44.123
The colored, the white,
say they want one army.

34:44.331 --> 34:46.125
You can forget that, C.J.

34:46.460 --> 34:49.128
White folks ain't never
gonna integrate no army.

34:49.670 --> 34:54.007
I don't know. If they do,
I'm gonna be ready for them.

sitting-around-the-shack music
today, C.J.

36:08.333 --> 36:12.253
I want all you out of those baseball
uniforms and into work clothes.

36:12.462 --> 36:15.130
You'll report to me at 1600.

36:15.340 --> 36:18.717
We got a work detail, painting
the lobby of the Officers' Club.

36:18.927 --> 36:21.303
Why can't those officers
paint their own club?

36:21.513 --> 36:23.055
Hell, no, Smalls.

36:23.265 --> 36:25.724
Let the Great Colored
Cleanup Company do it.

36:25.934 --> 36:28.894
Our motto is, "Anything
you don't wanna do",

36:29.104 --> 36:31.397

That's enough.

36:45.453 --> 36:50.541
Let me tell all you fancy-assed,
ball-playing Negroes something.

36:51.209 --> 36:54.795
The reasons for any orders
given by a superior officer

36:55.005 --> 36:56.714
is none of y'all's business.

36:56.923 --> 36:58.299
You obey them.

36:58.508 --> 37:00.384
This country is at war.

37:00.719 --> 37:04.179
And you niggers are soldiers,
nothing else.

37:05.015 --> 37:07.141
And something else.

37:07.350 --> 37:11.437
From now on, when I tell you to
do something, I want it done.

37:11.646 --> 37:14.732
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

37:15.775 --> 37:18.861
Now get out of those
baseball uniforms.

37:19.070 --> 37:22.406
I could smell you suckers
before I hit the door.

37:22.616 --> 37:25.117
Hey, what kind of
colored man are you?

37:27.746 --> 37:30.039
I'm a soldier, Peterson.

37:30.248 --> 37:34.835
And the kind of colored man that
don't like lazy, shiftless Negroes.

37:35.045 --> 37:38.297
Well, sir, you ain't got to
come in here calling us names.

37:38.548 --> 37:41.133
The Nazis call you schwarze.

37:41.301 --> 37:43.427
You gonna complain to Hitler
he hurt your feelings?

37:43.637 --> 37:46.722
Don't look like to me we could
do too much to them Nazis

37:46.932 --> 37:48.682
with paintbrushes, sarge.

37:53.355 --> 37:55.439
You trying to mock me, C.J.?

37:55.649 --> 37:58.067
- No, sir, sarge.
- Good.

37:58.234 --> 38:01.445
Because whatever an ignorant
Geechee like you has to say

38:01.613 --> 38:04.823
ain't worth
paying attention to, is it?

38:06.326 --> 38:07.993
Is it?

38:09.579 --> 38:12.164
I reckon not, sarge.

38:16.795 --> 38:18.087
You're a creep, Waters.

38:18.755 --> 38:22.091
Sarge's just joking, Pete.
He don't mean no harm.

38:22.300 --> 38:26.178
No, he does. I mean, we take
enough from them white boys.

38:26.388 --> 38:29.556
Yes, you do.
If it wasn't for Southern niggers

38:29.724 --> 38:32.351
white folks wouldn't think
we was all fools.

38:32.560 --> 38:35.270
Well, where are you from,
England?

38:41.903 --> 38:43.529
Wilkie.

38:44.197 --> 38:48.701
Looks like we got us
a wiseass Alabama boy here.

38:49.869 --> 38:51.704
Yes, sir.

38:51.913 --> 38:56.375
Now, don't you get smart, nigger.
Get your fucking hands off me.

39:00.046 --> 39:04.800
You wanna hit
old Sergeant Waters, boy?

39:06.636 --> 39:08.178
Come on.

39:09.556 --> 39:11.932
Please.

39:13.018 --> 39:14.810
Come on, nigger.

39:15.854 --> 39:16.979
Ten-hut.

39:18.940 --> 39:20.399
At ease.

39:20.608 --> 39:23.068
- What's going on here, sergeant?
- Nothing, sir.

39:23.278 --> 39:26.947
I was going over
some batting techniques, sir.

39:27.157 --> 39:29.742
Is there something you wanted?
Something I can do?

39:29.951 --> 39:31.785
No, no, nothing.

39:31.995 --> 39:35.873
I just wanted to congratulate you
men on the game you won today.

39:36.082 --> 39:39.877
Now, the way I figure it,
only seven more

39:40.086 --> 39:45.758
and we'll be the first colored team
in Army history to play the Yankees.

39:47.218 --> 39:49.261
The entire regiment
is counting on you.

39:49.471 --> 39:50.971
- Sergeant?
- Sir.

39:51.181 --> 39:56.477
As far as I'm concerned, these men
can have the rest of the day off.

39:56.936 --> 39:58.437
I beg your pardon, sir.

39:58.646 --> 40:01.190
Excuse me, sir. These men
don't need time off.

40:01.357 --> 40:05.360
They need work. Our fellas
in Africa aren't getting time off.

40:05.528 --> 40:08.864
Besides, we have orders to report
for a paint detail at 1600.

40:09.074 --> 40:11.158
Who issued that order?
Major Harris.

40:11.367 --> 40:13.911
- I'll speak to the major.
- Sir?

40:15.121 --> 40:19.750
I don't think it's a good idea to have a
colored NCO mixed up with your officers, sir.

40:19.918 --> 40:22.878
I said I'd speak to him,
sergeant.

40:23.671 --> 40:25.005
Yes, sir.

40:25.215 --> 40:30.385
Memphis, about that catch
you made in center field today...

40:30.595 --> 40:33.388
How in the hell
did you get up that high?

40:35.058 --> 40:39.978
They say I got bird in my blood, sir.
I hope it's American eagle.

40:40.188 --> 40:42.856
No, sir. Crow.

40:43.066 --> 40:46.485
See, a man told my daddy
the day I was born.

40:46.694 --> 40:49.655
He said, "The boy got the
shadow of crow in his chest..."

40:49.864 --> 40:51.657
That's fine, Memphis.

40:51.866 --> 40:55.744
Men, you played
a great game today.

40:55.954 --> 40:58.497
- Sergeant?
- A-ten-hut.

40:59.290 --> 41:00.958
Carry on.

41:03.253 --> 41:04.503
Shadow of a crow.

41:04.671 --> 41:06.630
- What do you say?
- Yeah, that's the...

41:09.759 --> 41:13.595
How long a story were you gonna
tell the man there, C.J.?

41:16.474 --> 41:20.686
Peterson. I ain't forgot you, boy.

41:20.895 --> 41:23.188
It's time to teach you a lesson.

41:23.731 --> 41:25.232
- Wilkie.
- Sir?

41:25.441 --> 41:28.152
Go outside and make sure
everything is set up.

41:28.903 --> 41:31.196
You want all the NCOs?

41:33.741 --> 41:36.618
I'm going outside
and wait for you, Geechee.

41:36.828 --> 41:38.745
And when you come out,

41:38.955 --> 41:41.540
I'm gonna whup
your black Southern ass.

41:41.916 --> 41:43.834
Let the whole company
watch too.

41:44.043 --> 41:46.712
You need to learn respect
for these stripes.

41:51.050 --> 41:52.885
The rest of you,

41:53.094 --> 41:57.014
get those goddamn uniforms off
like I said.

41:59.225 --> 42:01.185
You ain't gonna fight him,
are you?

42:01.394 --> 42:04.521
Don't do it. He'll fight dirty.
You can't whup the sarge.

42:04.731 --> 42:07.357
Well, you wanna fight
in my place, Cobb?

42:07.650 --> 42:09.902
Shoot.

42:10.111 --> 42:13.322
Pete. Pete, I got some
farmer's dust.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.824
Just a pinch will make you
strong as a bull.

42:16.034 --> 42:18.619
Would you get the hell
out of here with that crap?

42:18.828 --> 42:21.705
You can't speak up. You let
him treat you like a dog.

42:21.915 --> 42:23.707
Calling names
ain't nothing, Pete.

42:23.917 --> 42:27.252
I know who I is. Sarge ain't so bad.
He's been good to me.

42:27.462 --> 42:30.797
C.J., the man despises you.
You're wrong, Pete.

42:31.007 --> 42:33.300
Plus, I feel sorry
for him myself.

42:33.509 --> 42:38.138
Any man ain't sure where he belong
gotta be in a whole lot of pain.

42:39.557 --> 42:41.975
Look, don't you all even care
about nothing?

42:42.185 --> 42:43.977
Don't none of us like it, Pete.

42:44.187 --> 42:47.898
But this is the Army
and sarge got all the stripes.

42:48.441 --> 42:52.903
I'll go get the captain. You ain't got
to go out and get your head beaten in.

42:53.112 --> 42:55.697
Well, somebody's
got to fight him.

42:56.824 --> 42:58.158
Waters, what's going on?

42:58.326 --> 43:00.494
I had a problem with one of the guys.

43:00.703 --> 43:04.456
- Yeah?
- Don't worry about it.

43:06.709 --> 43:08.460
Come on now, boy.

43:08.670 --> 43:11.213
Let's take your
whupping like a man.

43:12.757 --> 43:14.925
Kick his ass, Pete.
Watch him, Pete.

43:15.134 --> 43:18.720
Yeah, come on out here
and kick old sarge's ass.

43:18.930 --> 43:19.972
Come on, Geechee.

43:20.139 --> 43:23.308
You don't want the sarge
to grow old waiting for you now.

43:36.406 --> 43:37.990
Fight.

43:38.783 --> 43:40.450
Fight him. Fight him. Grab him.

43:41.619 --> 43:44.371
- Get him.
- Come on.

43:44.580 --> 43:46.665
Come on. Come on.

43:52.964 --> 43:55.132
Watch him, Pete.

43:58.594 --> 44:02.306
He got him. That got him.

44:02.640 --> 44:04.975
Come on. Get up. Get up, sarge.

44:06.060 --> 44:09.062
You throw
a pretty mean punch, boy.

44:09.272 --> 44:11.940
But old sarge is here
to kick your ass.

44:17.697 --> 44:20.324
- Come on.
- Come on, Pete.

44:20.533 --> 44:21.992
Move over there.

44:22.201 --> 44:24.870
- There you go.
- Come on.

44:25.038 --> 44:26.955
Who the hell is fighting over there?

44:28.207 --> 44:31.251
- Come on.
- There you go.

44:31.461 --> 44:34.421
- Get up, Pete.
- Get up, get up.

44:34.630 --> 44:38.383
- Get him, sarge.
- Vernon. Vernon.

44:41.220 --> 44:42.888
That's enough.

44:51.356 --> 44:56.401
Yeah, he beat me
pretty bad that day, sir.

44:57.779 --> 45:00.781
Did anybody report
the fight to an officer?

45:00.990 --> 45:04.076
No, sir, I never reported it.
I know I should have,

45:04.285 --> 45:07.704
but he left me alone after that
so I just played ball.

45:10.249 --> 45:12.751
I appreciate your honesty,
Peterson.

45:13.336 --> 45:15.003
Thank you, sir.

45:18.883 --> 45:22.344
Did you see Sergeant Waters
the night he was killed?

45:22.595 --> 45:25.639
No, sir. Smalls and I
had guard duty.

45:27.850 --> 45:31.103
Thank you. That'll be all for now.
Yes, sir.

45:33.064 --> 45:36.400
Did the team ever get
to play the Yankees?

45:36.609 --> 45:40.570
No, sir. We lost the last game
to a sanitation company.

47:35.478 --> 47:38.146
What brings you out to my
neighborhood, captain?

47:38.356 --> 47:39.731
Slumming?

47:40.066 --> 47:41.900
I wanted you to see the request

47:42.109 --> 47:46.029
I've sent to Colonel Nivens to have
your investigation terminated.

47:46.239 --> 47:49.491
Now, my reasons have nothing
to do with you personally.

47:49.700 --> 47:52.035
My request won't hurt
your career in any way.

47:52.245 --> 47:55.539
It's just that there are other
things to consider in this case.

47:55.748 --> 47:57.374
Only the color of my skin.

47:57.583 --> 47:59.918
Now, hold it, Davenport.

48:00.127 --> 48:02.671
I want the people that
killed Waters prosecuted.

48:02.880 --> 48:04.965
- So do I.
- Then give this up.

48:05.174 --> 48:08.718
White people down here, they
won't see their duty or justice.

48:08.928 --> 48:12.389
They'll see you. And you can't
possibly get at the truth.

48:12.598 --> 48:16.685
Why? Because two white
officers are involved in this?

48:16.894 --> 48:20.522
And you can't get them charged,
court-martialed or anything else.

48:20.731 --> 48:23.733
Why wasn't there any mention
of them in my report?

48:24.193 --> 48:26.945
You think I'm gonna let you
get away with this?

48:30.658 --> 48:33.910
I was ordered not
to include it.

48:34.537 --> 48:37.998
- By who?
- Colonel Nivens.

48:40.710 --> 48:42.419
Now, look,

48:42.628 --> 48:47.549
they took two .45-caliber slugs
out of Waters, Army issue.

48:47.758 --> 48:51.136
Now, if my men thought
a white officer had killed him,

48:51.345 --> 48:53.305
there would have been
a slaughter.

48:54.557 --> 48:56.474
Who are the officers?

48:56.684 --> 49:00.228
Lieutenant Byrd in Ordnance
and a Captain Wilcox,

49:00.396 --> 49:02.397
12th Hospital Group.

49:02.732 --> 49:04.899
Private Seymour saw them
on the road.

49:05.109 --> 49:08.361
When I checked the officers'
billet, I found them both asleep.

49:08.571 --> 49:11.740
They admitted they'd had an
argument with the sergeant...

49:11.949 --> 49:14.200
but said they'd left him
on the road.

49:14.410 --> 49:17.287
So you never believed
the Klan was involved.

49:17.496 --> 49:20.165
No. No.

49:20.374 --> 49:23.168
Now can you see why this
thing needs somebody else?

49:26.422 --> 49:28.173
Tell me what they told you.

49:30.593 --> 49:32.802
Look, hotshot,

49:33.179 --> 49:36.181
they're not gonna let you
charge those two men.

49:37.600 --> 49:40.101
Tell me what they told you.

49:41.812 --> 49:44.522
Left, hup, three, four.

49:44.732 --> 49:47.332
Left, hup, three, four.

49:56.994 --> 50:01.206
Left, two, three, four.

50:07.254 --> 50:11.132
You wanna move your ass off
the goddamn road, sergeant?

50:12.134 --> 50:14.886
Well, I'll be damned.

50:15.096 --> 50:18.390
If it ain't the white boys.

50:19.600 --> 50:21.017
Did you hear what he said?

50:21.227 --> 50:22.310
- Shit.
- Let it go.

50:22.520 --> 50:25.897
Let it go my ass.
Come here, sergeant.

50:26.107 --> 50:31.319
White boys,
all starched and stiff.

50:31.529 --> 50:36.282
Want everybody to learn
that symphony shit.

50:36.617 --> 50:39.035
That's what you said in France,

50:39.245 --> 50:42.956
and, you know,
I listened to it.

50:43.165 --> 50:45.291
Am I right, now? Am I?

50:45.501 --> 50:48.211
You'd better straighten up
and salute an officer

50:48.379 --> 50:50.588
or I'll take your
fucking stripes, boy.

50:51.465 --> 50:53.133
That's better.

51:01.142 --> 51:05.937
Well, look at the nigger.

51:06.147 --> 51:09.941
You come to attention right now,
and that is an order.

51:10.484 --> 51:14.654
I ain't doing nothing
white folks say do. No more.

51:14.864 --> 51:16.948
No, leave him alone,
the man is drunk.

51:17.158 --> 51:19.617
I want the nigger to
do like I tell him. Do it.

51:19.827 --> 51:21.786
- No.
- I'll teach him, goddamn it.

51:21.954 --> 51:24.205
I always mind y'all.

51:25.624 --> 51:28.168
Look what it's done to me.

51:29.420 --> 51:31.796
I hate myself.

51:32.006 --> 51:35.008
Don't blame me. God's the one
who made you black, not me.

51:35.217 --> 51:36.801
My daddy said,

51:37.762 --> 51:41.014
"Don't talk like this,"

51:41.390 --> 51:43.683
talk like that.

51:44.143 --> 51:45.351
Don't say,

51:47.730 --> 51:49.272
"Say..."

51:53.986 --> 51:56.196
I even killed for you.

52:01.577 --> 52:02.786
Stop!

52:03.537 --> 52:07.415
You wanna kill him? The man is sick.
Let him go. You're gonna kill him.

52:07.625 --> 52:12.086
Come on.

52:24.767 --> 52:27.519
White men are killing for you,
nigger.

52:29.605 --> 52:32.190
Good men dying for you.

52:37.822 --> 52:42.283
So anyway, they said
they left Waters about 2310.

52:44.703 --> 52:48.373
And everyone in the barracks
confirms that they were in by 2330

52:48.582 --> 52:51.709
and that neither man left
till the following morning.

52:52.545 --> 52:56.089
That's nothing but white officers
lying to protect two of their own.

52:56.257 --> 52:57.757
You know that.

52:57.925 --> 53:01.594
I'm arresting both of them, captain.
Consider yourself under arrest...

53:01.804 --> 53:04.389
pending my charges against you.
What charges?

53:04.598 --> 53:08.059
It was your duty to go over
Nivens' head if you had to.

53:08.269 --> 53:11.062
Oh, you're gonna arrest
the colonel too, Davenport?

53:11.272 --> 53:13.064
Because he's part
of their alibi.

53:13.274 --> 53:16.526
He was there in the officers'
billet when they came in.

53:16.735 --> 53:19.320
Played poker till 3:30
in the morning, yeah.

53:19.530 --> 53:24.158
Yeah, the colonel, Major Hines
and four other white officers.

53:24.368 --> 53:26.035
They're all lying.

53:26.245 --> 53:28.621
You just go out and prove it.

53:44.388 --> 53:48.016
Sir, I intend to arrest Lieutenant
Byrd and Captain Wilcox.

53:48.225 --> 53:51.185
You will do nothing of the kind.
Colonel.

53:51.395 --> 53:55.064
I believe these men had something
to do with Sergeant Waters' death.

53:56.650 --> 53:58.818
No, I can't allow that.

53:59.028 --> 54:02.155
You have no authority
to arrest white officers.

54:02.364 --> 54:05.074
Then give me the authority, sir.

54:05.284 --> 54:06.409
Colonel.

54:06.619 --> 54:08.912
Your breakfast is ready.

54:11.123 --> 54:12.874
Thank you, honey.

54:14.710 --> 54:17.337
Can I have someone
fetch you coffee, captain?

54:17.546 --> 54:20.173
No, thank you, ma'am.

54:23.177 --> 54:27.096
I hope they're making your stay at
Fort Neal real comfortable, captain.

54:27.431 --> 54:31.309
They're taking good care of me.
It's very thoughtful of you to ask.

54:33.854 --> 54:34.979
Good morning.

54:35.147 --> 54:37.357
No, I can't give you
that authority.

54:37.566 --> 54:40.360
- I told you.
- 30.

54:40.569 --> 54:41.736
I was there.

54:41.946 --> 54:45.114
Now, you've read
our affidavits on this thing.

54:45.324 --> 54:48.993
Colonel, what will the Army say
when they find out white officers

54:49.203 --> 54:52.330
beat up the victim not long
before he was shot to death?

54:52.539 --> 54:55.917
Their CO refuses to report
they had anything to do with it

54:56.126 --> 54:58.962
and he signs an affidavit
supporting their alibi.

55:00.339 --> 55:04.342
These two are our best suspects.
How can you not have them arrested

55:04.551 --> 55:07.720
or at least questioned
by the investigating officer?

55:11.308 --> 55:14.602
Something like this
is bound to get out.

55:17.064 --> 55:19.190
I didn't say
you couldn't question them.

55:20.192 --> 55:22.485
But I want
a white officer present.

55:22.695 --> 55:25.238
And I want everything
that's said reported to me.

55:25.447 --> 55:28.449
- Is that clear?
- Of course, sir.

55:37.334 --> 55:40.586
You're dismissed, captain.
Yes, sir.

56:05.863 --> 56:12.785
♪ What a privilege to carry ♪

56:13.037 --> 56:19.292
♪ Everything to God in prayer ♪

56:20.002 --> 56:26.924

56:27.342 --> 56:34.265

56:34.767 --> 56:41.647

57:28.195 --> 57:31.072
Hey, Virge, same old sermon?

57:37.788 --> 57:40.248
I didn't know you were
a religious man, Henson.

57:40.916 --> 57:42.250
I'm not.

57:42.459 --> 57:44.836
I just play this organ.

57:45.587 --> 57:49.465
If I play on Sundays, I get out of a
few work details during the week.

57:49.633 --> 57:50.675
That's all.

57:50.884 --> 57:53.344
I wanna talk about Sergeant Waters.
Yeah?

57:53.637 --> 57:58.808
There ain't much to talk about,
except for I didn't like the man myself

57:59.017 --> 58:01.352
on account of
what he did to C.J.

58:01.562 --> 58:03.187
What did he do?

58:03.397 --> 58:05.106
I don't mean you no offense,

58:05.482 --> 58:09.527
but I ain't exactly crazy
about talking to no officer.

58:10.195 --> 58:11.529
Colored or white.

58:12.489 --> 58:14.448
Oh, you're gonna talk, Henson.

58:14.658 --> 58:18.202
You'll talk or I'll put your ass
in the stockade so long

58:18.370 --> 58:20.204
you'll forget how to.

58:27.713 --> 58:29.463
He was always on...

58:29.673 --> 58:32.508
Always on C.J.'s back
about something.

58:32.718 --> 58:36.721
Every little thing. Least ways,
that's how it seemed to me.

58:36.930 --> 58:39.473
Then the shooting went down.
What shooting?

58:39.683 --> 58:42.560
Well, the shooting over at
Williams' Golden Palace.

58:42.769 --> 58:46.230
Happened just last year right at
the end of the baseball season.

58:46.440 --> 58:50.193
A whole lot of shots had gone off
right near the barracks.

58:50.402 --> 58:56.157
I had gone over and gotten a little
juiced at the Enlisted Men's Club.

58:58.452 --> 59:00.536
Somebody's shooting.

59:00.829 --> 59:02.997
They're shooting over there.

59:03.207 --> 59:05.666
Everybody up. Wake them up, Wilkie.
Move it.

59:05.876 --> 59:08.753
Come on, Un-ass them bunks.
Come on, you Geechees.

59:08.962 --> 59:11.422
Off your asses, on your feet.
Everybody up.

59:11.632 --> 59:14.091
- Let's go.
- What's going on, man?

59:14.301 --> 59:17.553
Company, a-ten-hut.

59:18.430 --> 59:20.223
There's been a shooting.

59:20.432 --> 59:23.184
One of ours bucked the line
at Williams' pay phone

59:23.352 --> 59:25.311
and three soldiers are dead.

59:25.479 --> 59:28.481
Two colored, one white MP.

59:28.690 --> 59:31.192
The man who bucked
the line, he killed the MP

59:31.693 --> 59:34.612
and the white boys
started shooting everybody.

59:34.821 --> 59:37.031
That's how our two got shot.

59:37.241 --> 59:40.618
And this lowdown nigger we're
looking for got chased down here.

59:40.786 --> 59:43.621
Was almost caught till
somebody in these barracks

59:43.789 --> 59:46.540
started shooting at
the men chasing him.

59:47.334 --> 59:53.673
So we got us a vicious, lowdown
murdering piece of black trash

59:53.882 --> 59:55.925
in here somewhere.

59:56.510 --> 59:58.970
And a few people
who helped him.

01:00:02.057 --> 01:00:04.392
If any of you are in this,

01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:08.729
I want you to step forward.

01:00:13.318 --> 01:00:16.737
All you baseball niggers
are innocent?

01:00:17.322 --> 01:00:18.572
- Wilkie.
- Sir.

01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:21.575
Make the search.
Open those footlockers. Come on.

01:00:21.785 --> 01:00:24.787
All right, Peterson, what are
you waiting for, an invitation?

01:00:26.164 --> 01:00:30.042
Open them up. Spread them out.
I wanna see what's happening inside.

01:00:30.252 --> 01:00:31.919
Memphis, you in this?

01:00:32.129 --> 01:00:34.380
No, sir, sarge.

01:00:35.382 --> 01:00:37.633
You heard what the sergeant said.

01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:39.427
How many of you
were out tonight?

01:00:40.095 --> 01:00:44.265
I was over at Williams' around about 7.
I got me a pack of Lucky Strikes.

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:47.810
- But I didn't try to call home, though.
- Got something.

01:00:58.030 --> 01:00:59.947
Still warm.

01:01:00.157 --> 01:01:01.574
C.J., is this yours?

01:01:01.783 --> 01:01:04.577
You know it ain't mine, sarge.

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:06.871
Probably not.

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:09.498
Probably just crawled in
through a window,

01:01:09.708 --> 01:01:12.752
passed everybody's bunk,
Peterson, Cobb,

01:01:12.961 --> 01:01:15.254
and just snuggled up
under yours?

01:01:15.464 --> 01:01:18.716
Must be voodoo, right, boy? Or
some of that farmer's dust.

01:01:18.925 --> 01:01:23.137
That ain't mine, sarge. I hate guns.
Makes me feel bad just to see a gun.

01:01:23.347 --> 01:01:25.473
Liar. Place this man
under arrest.

01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:28.684
Look, sir, C.J. couldn't hurt a fly, sarge.
You know that.

01:01:28.894 --> 01:01:31.687
I found a gun, soldier.
You know it ain't him.

01:01:31.897 --> 01:01:35.399
Who is it then? You?
I saw somebody sneak in here.

01:01:35.609 --> 01:01:39.153
You were drunk when you left the club.
Throw his ass in the shower.

01:01:39.363 --> 01:01:41.947
Well, I was here all night.
C.J. ain't go nowhere.

01:01:42.157 --> 01:01:43.949
He was asleep
before I got to bed.

01:01:44.159 --> 01:01:46.452
Oh, you think he's innocent?

01:01:47.287 --> 01:01:49.413
C.J. Memphis,

01:01:49.623 --> 01:01:53.042
playing cotton picker,
singing the blues,

01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:56.629
bowing and scraping,
smiling in white folks' faces.

01:01:56.838 --> 01:02:00.633
This man undermined us.
You and me. Everybody.

01:02:00.967 --> 01:02:03.511
That "yes, sir, boss"
is hiding something.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:08.599
Are we like that today, in 1944?
He shot that white boy.

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:17.900
What are you going to
do now, boy?

01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:23.823
Hit a noncommissioned officer.

01:02:24.032 --> 01:02:27.201
Well, C.J. just lost his head...
Shut up.

01:02:27.994 --> 01:02:29.286
Get him out of here.

01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:48.305
Sarge, I know I saw somebody.

01:02:49.015 --> 01:02:52.643
Smalls, I saw somebody, I did.

01:02:52.853 --> 01:02:55.813
Oh, C.J. was sleeping
when I came in.

01:02:56.022 --> 01:02:59.066
Well, it's Waters.
Can't y'all see that?

01:03:08.326 --> 01:03:10.411
You know, I seen them before.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:13.038
Yeah, we had them in Alabama.

01:03:13.248 --> 01:03:15.958
White man give him
a little-ass job as a servant,

01:03:16.168 --> 01:03:18.210
and when the boss
ain't looking,

01:03:18.378 --> 01:03:21.297
that old copycat nigger
act like he the new boss.

01:03:21.506 --> 01:03:23.757
Shouting,
ordering people around.

01:03:25.719 --> 01:03:28.804
You see, arresting C.J.,
that'll get Waters another stripe.

01:03:29.014 --> 01:03:31.140
Yeah.
Next, it'll be you or you.

01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:34.810
You see, he can't look good
unless he's standing on you.

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:37.146
Cobb told him C.J.
was here all evening.

01:03:37.314 --> 01:03:39.106
Waters didn't even listen,
did he?

01:03:39.733 --> 01:03:42.109
Turning somebody in.

01:03:42.611 --> 01:03:44.945
"Yeah, look what I done,
captain, boss."

01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:49.033
Only reason they let him in is they
know he'll do what they tell him to.

01:03:49.242 --> 01:03:51.619
See, I've seen
this kind of fool before, boy.

01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:54.413
Yeah, somebody's gonna
kill him one of these days.

01:03:54.623 --> 01:03:57.124
I heard they killed a sergeant
at Fort Robinson.

01:03:57.334 --> 01:04:00.085
- A recruit did it.
- Forget it, Pete.

01:04:00.295 --> 01:04:04.215
Our luck, sarge will come through
the war, won't even get a scratch.

01:04:04.424 --> 01:04:06.300
Yeah, maybe,

01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:08.719
but I'm going over
to them stockades.

01:04:08.929 --> 01:04:10.638
Tell them MPs what I know.

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:13.015
C.J. was in here all evening.

01:04:13.225 --> 01:04:14.725
I'm gonna go with you.

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:18.521
Y'all wait up. I'm coming too.

01:04:20.398 --> 01:04:23.025
Was Wilkie the only person
out of his bunk?

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:26.654
I guess.
Wilkie came in with the sarge.

01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:28.364
But it's hard to say.

01:04:28.532 --> 01:04:33.327
It's been a while and like I said,
I was a little juiced that night.

01:04:35.914 --> 01:04:39.208
- Ellis.
- Yes? Yes, sir?

01:04:39.417 --> 01:04:42.836
Find out what's holding up my
investigation of Wilcox and Byrd.

01:04:43.463 --> 01:04:45.047
Yes, sir.

01:04:48.677 --> 01:04:51.595
The night Sergeant Waters
was killed, where were you?

01:04:51.805 --> 01:04:53.389
I was in the barracks.

01:04:53.598 --> 01:04:58.310
I played checkers with Cobb
till 9:30 and then I went to bed.

01:05:01.982 --> 01:05:05.609
Is there gonna be
anything else, sir?

01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:08.237
Dismissed, private.

01:05:25.964 --> 01:05:27.214
Let her go.

01:05:27.424 --> 01:05:30.634
Let me know when it's full board.
Here we go. Let's go, baby.

01:05:30.844 --> 01:05:33.679
- Pick it up.
- Keep your rifles up.

01:05:35.056 --> 01:05:36.265
That's it.

01:05:40.145 --> 01:05:42.187
That's it, move out! Move out!
Move your ass!

01:05:43.857 --> 01:05:46.108
That's it, move out! Move out!

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:55.492
Goddamn it, get going!
That's it, that's it, move it out!

01:05:58.747 --> 01:06:01.123
- Shake it out! Hit that wall!
- Get your feet up!

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:03.334
Hurry it up! Hurry it up!

01:06:03.543 --> 01:06:06.545
Move out! Move out! That's it!

01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:10.424
- Watch it!
- Shake your ass! That's it!

01:06:10.592 --> 01:06:12.217
Move it out!

01:06:15.764 --> 01:06:17.306
Move it! Let's go!

01:06:18.933 --> 01:06:20.476
Ellis!

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:24.063
Ellis!

01:06:29.235 --> 01:06:30.361
Hold it!

01:06:31.279 --> 01:06:34.865
- Stop shooting!
- Stop shooting!

01:06:49.547 --> 01:06:51.715
Which one of you idiots
is Cobb?

01:06:57.681 --> 01:06:59.598
That's me, sir.

01:06:59.808 --> 01:07:01.892
You all right, captain?

01:07:03.103 --> 01:07:05.020
I wanna talk to you.

01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:07.564
What'd he want old Cobb for?

01:07:08.650 --> 01:07:10.109
I don't know.

01:07:10.318 --> 01:07:12.194
What'd he ask you, Pete?

01:07:12.404 --> 01:07:15.948
He just asked a couple of questions
about the baseball game...

01:07:16.157 --> 01:07:17.533
some about the sarge.

01:07:17.742 --> 01:07:19.326
Didn't amount to too much.

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:22.496
Yeah, we was homeys, me and
C.J., both from Mississippi.

01:07:22.706 --> 01:07:23.789
C.J., from Carmella.

01:07:23.998 --> 01:07:27.584
Me, I'm from up around Jutlerville,
what they call Snake County.

01:07:27.794 --> 01:07:30.504
How did you feel when your
best friend was arrested?

01:07:30.714 --> 01:07:33.006
I hated Waters for it, sir.
Hated?

01:07:33.216 --> 01:07:35.676
C.J. ain't killed nobody.

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:39.263
He hit Waters, didn't he?
Yeah, but the sergeant made him, sir.

01:07:39.472 --> 01:07:42.516
He called that boy things
he ain't never heard before.

01:07:42.726 --> 01:07:45.936
C.J. was from the farm,
a country boy.

01:07:46.146 --> 01:07:50.023
That jail cell started doing
crazy things to C.J., sir.

01:07:50.233 --> 01:07:52.651
It started closing in on him.

01:08:08.334 --> 01:08:10.461
Are you all right?

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:17.760
It's hard to breathe
in these little spaces, Cobb.

01:08:19.679 --> 01:08:22.765
What they doing to you
in here, C.J.?

01:08:24.893 --> 01:08:27.810
Man wasn't made for this here.

01:08:29.564 --> 01:08:31.774
Nothing was.

01:08:33.859 --> 01:08:37.112
Don't think I'll ever see
an animal in a cage again

01:08:37.322 --> 01:08:39.615
and not feel sorry for it.

01:08:40.033 --> 01:08:41.742
Rather be on a chain gang.

01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:44.118
Oh, come on, homey.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:47.956
Don't think I'm getting
out of here, Cobb.

01:08:48.166 --> 01:08:50.792
Feel like I'm going crazy.

01:08:51.002 --> 01:08:52.877
Can't walk in here.

01:08:53.087 --> 01:08:54.921
Can't see the sun.

01:08:55.506 --> 01:08:59.760
I tried to sing,
but nothing won't come out.

01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:03.764
Yesterday, I broke a guitar string.

01:09:06.725 --> 01:09:09.435
And I lost my dust.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:12.147
Got no protection, Cobb.

01:09:12.357 --> 01:09:15.776
Nothing to keep the dogs
from tearing at my bones.

01:09:15.984 --> 01:09:18.987
C.J., stop talking crazy.

01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:25.536
You know who come up here
last night?

01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:31.542
Sergeant Waters.

01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:40.884
They talking about
giving you five years.

01:09:44.013 --> 01:09:47.808
They call what you did
mutiny, boy.

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:50.185
That gun ain't mine.

01:09:50.395 --> 01:09:52.520
We know that, C.J.

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:55.399
We changed the charge
on you this morning.

01:09:56.442 --> 01:10:00.779
You're in here for striking
a superior officer, boy.

01:10:01.739 --> 01:10:03.991
And everybody seen it too.

01:10:04.868 --> 01:10:07.703
Why are you doing this to me,
sarge?

01:10:07.912 --> 01:10:10.706
Oh, don't feel too bad, C.J.

01:10:11.082 --> 01:10:13.125
It has to be this way.

01:10:14.878 --> 01:10:16.461
You see,

01:10:17.839 --> 01:10:21.216
the first war didn't change
nothing for the Negro.

01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:25.846
But this one,
gonna change everything.

01:10:26.598 --> 01:10:29.016
Them Nazis ain't all crazy.

01:10:29.559 --> 01:10:34.229
Whole lot of people just can't seem to
fit in to where things seem to be going.

01:10:34.856 --> 01:10:36.815
Like you, C.J.

01:10:37.525 --> 01:10:42.070
See, the black race
can't afford you no more.

01:10:43.031 --> 01:10:46.116
Oh, there used to be a time
we'd see somebody like you

01:10:46.284 --> 01:10:49.244
singing, clowning,
"yes, sir, boss" ing,

01:10:49.454 --> 01:10:51.496
and we wouldn't do anything.

01:10:51.706 --> 01:10:53.624
Folks liked that.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.459
You were good.

01:10:55.668 --> 01:10:57.628
Homey kind of nigger.

01:10:58.421 --> 01:11:01.673
When they needed somebody
to mistreat, call a name or two,

01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:03.800
they paraded you.

01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:07.763
Reminded them
of the good old days.

01:11:11.476 --> 01:11:13.769
Not no more.

01:11:14.771 --> 01:11:17.814
The day of the Geechee
is gone, boy.

01:11:18.399 --> 01:11:19.983
And you're going with it.

01:11:20.735 --> 01:11:25.614
We can't let nobody go on believing
we're all fools like you.

01:11:33.039 --> 01:11:36.249
I waited a long time
for you, boy.

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.710
But I got you.

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:42.089
I put two Geechees in jail
in Camp Campbell, Kentucky.

01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:44.132
Three in Fort Huachuca.

01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:47.970
Now I've got you.

01:11:48.888 --> 01:11:52.933
One less fool for the race
to be ashamed of.

01:12:29.679 --> 01:12:31.638
What happened to him?

01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:35.350
C.J. killed himself, sir.

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:41.356
The day after I saw him, the MPs
found him hanging from the bars.

01:12:43.443 --> 01:12:45.235
We lost our last game.

01:12:45.445 --> 01:12:47.279
We just threw it.

01:12:47.488 --> 01:12:49.531
We did it for C.J.

01:12:50.158 --> 01:12:54.036
Captain Taylor was mad because we
ain't get to play the Yankees.

01:12:54.495 --> 01:12:57.914
Peterson was right on that one.
We needed to protest that man.

01:13:04.505 --> 01:13:06.757
And the sergeant,
what did he do?

01:13:06.966 --> 01:13:08.633
Well, they broke up the team

01:13:08.843 --> 01:13:12.637
and they assigned us to this here
smoke-generating company.

01:13:12.847 --> 01:13:16.308
And the sarge,
he just started acting funny.

01:13:16.517 --> 01:13:18.935
He stayed drunk all the time.

01:13:19.479 --> 01:13:21.521
What time did you get in
the night he was killed?

01:13:21.689 --> 01:13:24.274
Between 2120 and 9:30.

01:13:24.484 --> 01:13:27.277
Me and Henson listened
to The Jack Benny show,

01:13:27.487 --> 01:13:31.531
played checkers.
Who was the last man in that night?

01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:34.076
Peterson and Smalls.
They had guard duty, sir.

01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:38.789
Is that it, captain?
Thank you, corporal.

01:13:38.998 --> 01:13:40.582
Yes, sir.

01:13:48.883 --> 01:13:51.426
Eight ball, corner pocket.

01:13:55.932 --> 01:13:58.308
Whose idea was this, Charlie?
Nivens.

01:13:58.518 --> 01:14:02.270
And you have to clear the area, Jim.
We're here to question these two.

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:06.483
He's got no business in here.
Take it up with the colonel.

01:14:12.115 --> 01:14:14.616
Now, this is Captain Davenport.

01:14:14.826 --> 01:14:19.412
You both understand, you're to give
the captain your full cooperation.

01:14:20.331 --> 01:14:22.249
You're a lawyer?

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:25.293
I'm not here to answer
your questions, lieutenant.

01:14:25.503 --> 01:14:31.341
Sit down.

01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:34.219
Yes, sir.

01:14:38.099 --> 01:14:41.935
When did you last see Waters?
Same night somebody killed him.

01:14:42.395 --> 01:14:46.481
Course, I should've done it myself by
the way he spoke to Wilcox and me.

01:14:46.899 --> 01:14:48.733
How did he speak
to you, captain?

01:14:48.943 --> 01:14:52.320
Well, he was drunk. He said a
few things he shouldn't have.

01:14:52.530 --> 01:14:56.241
I told the lieutenant not to make
the situation any worse than it was.

01:14:56.450 --> 01:15:00.954
So we just left him there, on the
side of the road, on his knees.

01:15:01.164 --> 01:15:02.956
Alive.

01:15:05.376 --> 01:15:06.793
Exactly what did he say?

01:15:07.879 --> 01:15:11.173
He said he wasn't gonna obey
the white man's orders anymore.

01:15:11.382 --> 01:15:14.509
And he starts blaming
Wilcox and me for him being black.

01:15:14.719 --> 01:15:17.846
I mean, imagine that,
Hell, I didn't even know the man.

01:15:18.055 --> 01:15:20.557
Yeah and he said
he killed somebody too.

01:15:20.766 --> 01:15:23.602
And some pretty
insulting things about us.

01:15:23.811 --> 01:15:25.562
I mean, white officers.

01:15:25.771 --> 01:15:27.564
Did he say who? Mention a name?

01:15:27.773 --> 01:15:30.358
Look, the goddamn nigger
was disrespectful.

01:15:30.568 --> 01:15:33.737
No way a colored soldier
speak to a white officer like that.

01:15:33.946 --> 01:15:36.239
What are we doing,
wasting time on this?

01:15:36.449 --> 01:15:39.618
You answer him
like he wants you to, Byrd,

01:15:39.911 --> 01:15:42.704
or I'll stick it to your ass
every chance I get.

01:15:42.914 --> 01:15:43.997
You got that?

01:15:44.207 --> 01:15:45.373
Yes, sir.

01:15:45.583 --> 01:15:47.209
Captain, let me handle this.

01:15:47.418 --> 01:15:49.502
Then handle it.

01:15:53.341 --> 01:15:56.426
You said he was disrespectful.
Is that why you killed him?

01:15:56.636 --> 01:15:59.179
- I killed no one.
- Sit down.

01:15:59.889 --> 01:16:01.556
- You hit him?
- Knocked him down.

01:16:01.766 --> 01:16:03.016
- Shot him.
- He was alive.

01:16:03.184 --> 01:16:04.684
You beat him up, shot him.

01:16:04.852 --> 01:16:07.771
Get out of my face before I kill you.
Like Waters?

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:09.147
- No!
- Soldier.

01:16:09.357 --> 01:16:11.608
He's trying to put it on me.
Sit down.

01:16:11.817 --> 01:16:14.569
Answer his questions, lieutenant.

01:16:18.407 --> 01:16:20.825
You were both coming off bivouac?
Speak up.

01:16:21.035 --> 01:16:22.994
You had weapons.
But we didn't fire.

01:16:23.204 --> 01:16:25.247
When did you turn them in?
Right away.

01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:27.082
Nivens took our .45s
to the MPs.

01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:28.291
He wanted it quiet.

01:16:28.459 --> 01:16:31.586
Didn't want colored boys to know
anybody white was involved.

01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:33.672
But those weapons
cleared ballistics.

01:16:33.881 --> 01:16:37.425
Besides, we've been short on .45
caliber ammo for, what, six months?

01:16:37.635 --> 01:16:40.804
It's for MPs
and special-duty people only.

01:16:41.138 --> 01:16:44.266
Look, nobody on that exercise
was issued any.

01:16:45.935 --> 01:16:46.977
What?

01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:53.817
I said, sir, nobody on the bivouac
was issued any .45 ammo.

01:16:54.277 --> 01:16:56.278
I don't believe you.

01:16:56.487 --> 01:16:57.821
Why wasn't I told?

01:16:58.030 --> 01:17:01.324
The weapons had cleared,
the colonel felt if he involved you,

01:17:01.534 --> 01:17:04.035
you'd go to Washington,
which you did anyway.

01:17:04.245 --> 01:17:07.998
Sir, I just wanna say we were not
involved with the sergeant's death.

01:17:08.207 --> 01:17:09.249
Now, I'm a doctor.

01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:12.127
We left that man on
the side of the road. Alive.

01:17:12.336 --> 01:17:14.546
- You're under arrest.
- The charge is murder.

01:17:14.714 --> 01:17:15.755
Captain...

01:17:15.923 --> 01:17:18.383
You think I believe that crap?

01:17:20.428 --> 01:17:22.012
Let them go.

01:17:22.555 --> 01:17:23.680
What?

01:17:23.889 --> 01:17:27.017
- Are we being charged?
- Not by me.

01:17:28.853 --> 01:17:33.690
What are you doing? You've got a
motive, you've got a witness.

01:17:34.358 --> 01:17:36.109
I mean, what more do you want?

01:17:36.319 --> 01:17:38.820
This is still my investigation,
Charlie.

01:17:40.573 --> 01:17:43.700
We've both been had, captain.
Colonel knew this all along.

01:17:43.909 --> 01:17:47.620
Been marching around in circles.
They are guilty and you know it.

01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:49.831
Now, I'll back you up.
Charge them.

01:17:50.041 --> 01:17:54.627
I do what the facts tell me, not you.
You don't know what a fact is.

01:17:54.795 --> 01:17:57.505
I'm the lawyer.
They teach law at West Point?

01:17:57.715 --> 01:18:01.551
You don't have to be a lawyer to
deal with those two assholes.

01:18:01.761 --> 01:18:05.138
And if they didn't
kill Waters, who did?

01:18:05.431 --> 01:18:08.224
I don't know yet.

01:18:22.573 --> 01:18:25.075
What do you know
about C.J. Memphis?

01:18:28.037 --> 01:18:30.413
A great ballplayer.

01:18:31.207 --> 01:18:32.374
Committed suicide.

01:18:32.583 --> 01:18:36.586
It was a tragedy.

01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:40.090
I think Waters tricked the kid
into attacking him.

01:18:41.384 --> 01:18:43.802
No, I can't believe that,
Davenport.

01:18:44.011 --> 01:18:46.596
This man managed
the finest baseball team

01:18:46.806 --> 01:18:49.307
in the entire
United States Army.

01:18:49.517 --> 01:18:52.310
Besides, colored people
aren't that devious.

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:54.896
Hell, we hadn't lost a game
for two years.

01:18:55.106 --> 01:18:56.147
And the finest...

01:18:56.315 --> 01:19:01.069
I mean, the finest player that
Waters ever had was C.J. Memphis.

01:19:01.278 --> 01:19:03.154
If you'd have seen him,
you'd know what I mean.

01:19:05.366 --> 01:19:07.450
Captain. Captain Davenport.

01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:11.454
We found Wilkie, but we haven't
located Peterson and Smalls yet.

01:19:11.664 --> 01:19:13.665
- Where's Wilkie?
- Waiting for you, sir.

01:19:13.874 --> 01:19:14.916
- Good.
- Wait.

01:19:15.126 --> 01:19:17.710
Didn't you question
Wilkie and Peterson already?

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.797
I asked you a question.
This is my investigation.

01:19:21.006 --> 01:19:23.466
Ellis, let's go.
Well, that's the problem.

01:19:23.676 --> 01:19:26.511
You arrogant son of a bitch.

01:19:30.933 --> 01:19:32.434
You nervous, Wilkie?

01:19:32.643 --> 01:19:36.020
No, I just couldn't figure out
why you called me back, sir.

01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:38.356
You said the sarge
busted you, right?

01:19:38.566 --> 01:19:42.193
Yeah, he got me busted, sir.
He reported me to the captain.

01:19:42.403 --> 01:19:44.154
- How'd you feel?
- Well, I...

01:19:44.363 --> 01:19:46.030
You and the sarge
were good friends.

01:19:46.198 --> 01:19:48.408
- Yeah...
- He was a nice guy.

01:19:48.617 --> 01:19:50.618
Didn't you tell me that?
Yeah, I...

01:19:50.828 --> 01:19:52.954
Would a nice guy
get a friend busted?

01:19:53.164 --> 01:19:54.372
- Well...
- No, speak up.

01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:56.583
You lied when you said
he was a nice guy?

01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:58.418
No. What I said was he was...

01:19:58.627 --> 01:20:01.796
Was Waters a nice guy or not?
No. No, he wasn't a nice guy.

01:20:02.006 --> 01:20:04.507
You don't turn somebody in.
Give him extra duty.

01:20:04.717 --> 01:20:08.094
But three stripes, it took me
10 years to get them stripes, sir.

01:20:08.554 --> 01:20:10.138
That's right.

01:20:10.347 --> 01:20:13.725
That made you mad, didn't it?
Yes, mad. Things I did for him.

01:20:13.934 --> 01:20:16.603
That's right. You were
his boy, weren't you?

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:19.439
You took care of the team.

01:20:19.648 --> 01:20:21.232
- You ran his errands.
- Well...

01:20:21.442 --> 01:20:24.277
You policed his quarters.
You listened to his stories.

01:20:24.487 --> 01:20:26.696
Put the gun under C.J.'s bunk.
Yes. No...

01:20:26.906 --> 01:20:28.781
Sit down!

01:20:29.325 --> 01:20:32.869
It was you Henson saw. You lied
about Waters, you're lying now.

01:20:33.078 --> 01:20:36.706
The only person out of barracks. Who
else could've found C.J.'s bunk?

01:20:36.916 --> 01:20:38.208
It was you, Wilkie. You.

01:20:38.375 --> 01:20:40.502
It was the sarge.
He ordered me to do it.

01:20:40.711 --> 01:20:44.172
He said I'd get my stripes back.
He wanted to teach C.J. a lesson.

01:20:44.381 --> 01:20:45.798
Put him in jail, scare him.

01:20:45.966 --> 01:20:48.635
The boy hit him, he had C.J.
where he wanted him.

01:20:48.844 --> 01:20:51.137
And then C.J., he hung himself.

01:20:51.347 --> 01:20:53.640
He died
like he was spiting the sarge.

01:20:53.849 --> 01:20:57.143
He didn't figure on that.
What did he have against Memphis?

01:20:57.353 --> 01:21:00.730
He despised him, but he would hide
it, everybody liked that boy.

01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:03.107
Underneath, it was
a crazy hate, captain.

01:21:03.317 --> 01:21:06.277
Crazy hate. You won't believe it.
Sometimes you could...

01:21:06.445 --> 01:21:09.113
You could just feel it.

Got everybody on the post
thinking he's a strong, black buck.

01:21:31.971 --> 01:21:34.556
White boys envy his strength.

You know the damage

We were in France
in the first war,

01:22:32.948 --> 01:22:35.199
we'd won decorations,

01:22:36.201 --> 01:22:40.913
but the white boys had told all
them French gals that we had tails.

01:22:41.915 --> 01:22:45.043
And they found
this ignorant colored soldier.

01:22:45.711 --> 01:22:47.629
Paid him to tie a tail to his ass

01:22:47.796 --> 01:22:50.548
and run around half-naked
making monkey sounds.

01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:56.471
They put him on a big round table
in the Café Napoléon.

01:22:57.348 --> 01:22:59.724
Put a reed in his hand,

01:22:59.933 --> 01:23:02.101
a crown on his head,

01:23:02.645 --> 01:23:07.482
blanket on his shoulders, and made him
eat bananas in front of them Frenchies.

01:23:08.859 --> 01:23:11.944
Oh, how the white boys
danced that night,

01:23:12.571 --> 01:23:15.948
passed out leaflets
with that boy's picture on it.

01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:22.330
Called him Moonshine,
king of the monkeys.

01:23:25.125 --> 01:23:26.501
When we slit his throat,

01:23:26.669 --> 01:23:29.879
you know that fool asked us
what he had done wrong?

01:23:49.525 --> 01:23:53.986
My daddy told me, we got to turn
our backs on his kind, Wilkie.

01:23:54.363 --> 01:23:57.824
Close our ranks to
the chitlins, collard greens,

01:23:58.033 --> 01:24:00.368
corn-bread style.

01:24:01.245 --> 01:24:07.375
We are men, soldiers.
And I don't intend for our race

01:24:07.584 --> 01:24:11.713
to be cheated out of its place
of honor and respect in this war

01:24:12.005 --> 01:24:14.757
because of fools like C.J.

01:24:16.093 --> 01:24:18.553
You watch everything he does.

01:24:19.221 --> 01:24:20.847
Everything.

01:24:23.559 --> 01:24:25.727
Give me a drink.

01:24:27.354 --> 01:24:29.605
And I watched him.

01:24:29.815 --> 01:24:31.482
But Waters couldn't wait.

01:24:31.692 --> 01:24:37.572
He wouldn't talk about nothing else.
C.J. this, C.J. all the time.

01:24:41.368 --> 01:24:44.036
Why didn't he pick on Peterson?
They had the fight.

01:24:44.246 --> 01:24:45.747
He liked Peterson.

01:24:45.956 --> 01:24:48.541
Pete fought back.
Sarge admired that.

01:24:48.751 --> 01:24:51.711
He was planning to promote Pete.
You imagine that?

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:55.381
He thought Peterson
would make a fine soldier.

01:24:59.344 --> 01:25:02.388
What did Peterson do
when C.J. died?

01:25:02.765 --> 01:25:04.599
Everybody blamed sarge.

01:25:06.018 --> 01:25:09.687
Pete put together that protest
that lost our last game.

01:25:09.897 --> 01:25:13.941
Afterwards, he kept to himself
or with Smalls.

01:25:20.908 --> 01:25:22.575
I didn't mean to do what I did.

01:25:22.785 --> 01:25:24.202
- Ellis!
- It wasn't my fault.

01:25:24.411 --> 01:25:25.578
- Ellis!
- Yes, sir.

01:25:25.788 --> 01:25:28.039
I did what he told me.
What is going on?

01:25:28.248 --> 01:25:29.290
We're shipping out.

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:32.084
They're gonna give us Negroes
a chance to fight.

01:25:32.294 --> 01:25:36.088
Hitler ain't got a chance. After what
Joe Louis did to Max Schmeling...

01:25:39.593 --> 01:25:41.594
Twenty-four-hour standby alert.

01:25:41.804 --> 01:25:44.263
It's the invasion of Europe, boys.

01:25:44.473 --> 01:25:47.642
Look out, Hitler, the niggers
is coming to get your ass

01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:48.851
through the fog.

01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:51.562
We gonna goose
the goose step there.

01:25:51.772 --> 01:25:52.814
Heil Hitler!

01:25:53.023 --> 01:25:55.691
We gonna turn them Nazis around.
Yeah!

01:25:55.901 --> 01:25:59.278
We're gonna teach them a thing
or two about them schwarze.

01:26:17.005 --> 01:26:18.714
- Ellis.
- Yes, sir.

01:26:18.924 --> 01:26:21.926
Private Wilkie is under arrest.
Take him to the stockade.

01:26:22.135 --> 01:26:23.302
Sir?

01:26:24.054 --> 01:26:25.763
You heard me.

01:28:38.522 --> 01:28:41.273
Private Smalls,
as you requested, sir.

01:28:42.275 --> 01:28:44.318
- Leave us alone, sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

01:28:51.284 --> 01:28:53.035
Why'd you go AWOL, soldier?

01:28:53.662 --> 01:28:56.080
Private Anthony Smalls, sir.

01:28:57.541 --> 01:28:59.125
Answer my question.

01:28:59.334 --> 01:29:01.544
I didn't go A-W-O-L, sir.

01:29:01.753 --> 01:29:05.006
See, I got drunk in Tynin
and I was just...

01:29:05.215 --> 01:29:08.175
Weren't you and Peterson
supposed to be on detail?

01:29:08.552 --> 01:29:10.553
Where was Peterson?

01:29:10.804 --> 01:29:12.304
Speak up.

01:29:12.514 --> 01:29:16.058
I don't know, sir.
You just walked off your detail

01:29:16.268 --> 01:29:18.269
and Peterson did nothing?
No, sir.

01:29:18.478 --> 01:29:22.732
See, he warned me, sir. Said, "Listen, Smalls.
Listen up, you..."

01:29:23.316 --> 01:29:27.737
Are you trying to make a fool
out of me, Smalls?

01:29:28.447 --> 01:29:30.072
No, sir.

01:29:31.450 --> 01:29:34.076
You two went over the hill
together, didn't you?

01:29:35.704 --> 01:29:37.329
Answer me!

01:29:41.168 --> 01:29:44.045
Yes.
Yes. You went over the hill

01:29:44.212 --> 01:29:47.715
because Peterson knew I'd find out
the two of you killed Waters.

01:29:47.924 --> 01:29:49.008
Didn't you?

01:29:52.054 --> 01:29:54.180
What? I can't hear you.

01:29:54.848 --> 01:29:57.391
You killed Waters, didn't you?

01:29:58.435 --> 01:30:01.103
I want an answer.

01:30:01.772 --> 01:30:04.523
Did you kill Waters?

01:30:04.733 --> 01:30:07.443
It was Peterson, sir.

01:30:09.446 --> 01:30:11.655
It wasn't me.

01:30:19.289 --> 01:30:22.083
Smalls, look who's
drunk on his ass, boy.

01:30:23.001 --> 01:30:25.294
Oh, leave him be, Pete.

01:30:25.504 --> 01:30:28.422
No, no.

01:30:28.632 --> 01:30:30.925
No, I'm gonna enjoy this.

01:30:31.927 --> 01:30:35.554
Big, bad Sergeant Waters
down on his knee.

01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:39.141
No, sir, Smalls.

01:30:39.684 --> 01:30:42.269
No, I'm gonna love this.

01:30:47.943 --> 01:30:49.819
Hey, sarge.

01:30:50.237 --> 01:30:51.612
Need some help?

01:30:51.822 --> 01:30:54.782
Hi, Pete.

01:30:55.617 --> 01:30:58.702
Oh, yeah. Here, come on
now, here we go.

01:31:02.332 --> 01:31:05.084
- That's the help I'll give you. Shut up!
- Peter...

01:31:08.213 --> 01:31:10.339
Smalls, some people...

01:31:12.384 --> 01:31:14.510
If this was a German,
would you kill it?

01:31:19.015 --> 01:31:23.352
If it was Hitler or that fucking
Tojo, would you kill him?

01:31:23.562 --> 01:31:25.813
There's a trick to it, Peterson.

01:31:26.481 --> 01:31:29.150
It's the only way you can win.

01:31:30.235 --> 01:31:31.610
See, C.J.,

01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:33.696
he could never make it.

01:31:33.905 --> 01:31:36.073
He was a clown.

01:31:36.324 --> 01:31:39.201
A clown in blackface. A nigger.

01:31:39.786 --> 01:31:43.372
See, you got to be like them.

01:31:43.915 --> 01:31:46.625
But the rules are fixed and...

01:31:48.461 --> 01:31:49.962
Listen.

01:31:51.631 --> 01:31:53.090
Hear it?

01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:56.677
It's C.J.

01:31:57.387 --> 01:32:01.307
♪ Lowdown
Lowdown dirty shame ♪ ♪

01:32:02.726 --> 01:32:04.727
I made him do it.

01:32:09.399 --> 01:32:11.609
But it doesn't make
any difference.

01:32:17.365 --> 01:32:22.077
They still hate you.

01:32:29.878 --> 01:32:32.087
Peterson. It's justice, Smalls.

01:32:32.714 --> 01:32:34.924
It's for C.J.

01:32:36.092 --> 01:32:40.638
Everybody. They still hate you.

01:32:59.574 --> 01:33:01.367
And you call that justice?

01:33:05.247 --> 01:33:06.956
No, sir.

01:33:07.415 --> 01:33:10.209
Then why the fuck
didn't you do something?

01:33:10.502 --> 01:33:12.294
I was just...

01:33:13.463 --> 01:33:15.881
Just scared of him, sir.

01:33:16.549 --> 01:33:19.468
He said everybody would think

01:33:19.678 --> 01:33:22.471
white people did it.

01:33:23.431 --> 01:33:26.392
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

01:33:28.061 --> 01:33:31.981
I'm sorry, I was just
so scared about it.

01:33:34.067 --> 01:33:36.735
Caught this one
on old bridge road, sir.

01:33:39.197 --> 01:33:41.240
That'll be all, thank you.

01:33:58.425 --> 01:34:00.634
You told it, didn't you?

01:34:21.614 --> 01:34:23.866
I didn't kill much.

01:34:25.452 --> 01:34:28.245
Some things
need getting rid of.

01:34:29.247 --> 01:34:32.541
A man like Waters never did
nobody no good anyway, captain.

01:34:39.549 --> 01:34:45.179
Who gave you the right
to judge?

01:34:45.764 --> 01:34:50.851
To decide who is fit
to be a Negro

01:34:51.144 --> 01:34:55.230
and who is not? Who?

01:35:04.115 --> 01:35:05.741
Sergeant.

01:35:12.791 --> 01:35:13.874
Sir?

01:35:14.084 --> 01:35:16.919
Get these goddamn men
out of here.

01:35:17.128 --> 01:35:18.629
Yes, sir.

01:36:46.009 --> 01:36:47.843
I hear they caught Peterson.

01:36:50.889 --> 01:36:52.639
I guess that's it.

01:36:53.183 --> 01:36:54.224
Got your man.

01:36:54.976 --> 01:36:57.644
Yeah, I got him.

01:37:00.648 --> 01:37:02.566
I was wrong.

01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:07.571
So was I.

01:37:08.406 --> 01:37:10.699
Say, Charlie, look,
I could do with a lift.

01:37:11.326 --> 01:37:12.701
Hop in.

01:37:25.131 --> 01:37:29.968
I guess I'll have to get used to
Negroes with bars on their shoulders.

01:37:30.178 --> 01:37:31.970
You know, being in charge.

01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:34.598
Oh, you'll get used to it, captain.

01:37:34.807 --> 01:37:36.975
You can bet your ass on that.

01:37:37.185 --> 01:37:39.436
You'll get used to it.

01:37:42.482 --> 01:37:44.066
Hut!
