WEBVTT

00:00.600 --> 00:01.970
I'll have him shittin' in my hand.

00:01.980 --> 00:03.050
What?

00:03.060 --> 00:04.320
- Mm-hmm.
- Wha... ?

00:05.560 --> 00:08.550
- What is this?
- That is the key to my cabin.

00:08.560 --> 00:10.500
I wanna keep it in the family.

00:10.510 --> 00:12.290
I don't want the cabin where
your girlfriend was murdered.

00:12.300 --> 00:13.409
That's sick.

00:13.410 --> 00:15.670
I can't work for you anymore.
You gotta find someone else.

00:15.680 --> 00:17.130
Well, do you know any other assassins?

00:17.140 --> 00:18.159
What if I trained your guys?

00:18.160 --> 00:19.789
My guys suck balls, you know it!

00:19.790 --> 00:22.650
If I suck balls, you are
king of suck balls mountain!

00:22.660 --> 00:24.430
Oh, shut the fuck up.

00:24.440 --> 00:26.340
I decided I'm gonna write
a scene about Sam.

00:26.350 --> 00:27.419
He beat you up,

00:27.420 --> 00:29.679
so we decided that you
needed to get out of there.

00:29.680 --> 00:31.290
Hey, Sally.

00:31.300 --> 00:32.850
Hey, Sam.

01:19.190 --> 01:20.430
Sorry, what?

01:20.440 --> 01:22.480
I said, did you grow up out here, Bobby?

01:23.530 --> 01:24.550
My name is...

01:26.940 --> 01:29.010
Oh, sorry. Barry.

01:29.020 --> 01:30.149
I grew up in Cleveland.

01:30.150 --> 01:31.730
You guys must have a lot in common.

01:33.570 --> 01:36.510
So, Sally, we saw you
on that space show.

01:36.520 --> 01:38.790
Oh... Yeah.

01:38.800 --> 01:40.990
Um, I've been booking a
lot of work actually.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.220
I've been getting lots of parts.
That was one of my smaller ones.

01:43.230 --> 01:45.190
But, um, I've got these new agents,

01:45.200 --> 01:47.209
- and they're really great.
- She's doing great.

01:47.210 --> 01:50.510
That's great. I'm really proud of you.

01:50.520 --> 01:51.620
Hey, I got this.

01:51.630 --> 01:53.930
- My treat.
- Oh. Thank you.

01:53.940 --> 01:55.680
So, uh, Mark Campbell,

01:55.690 --> 01:57.460
he's been coaching my boy's soccer team.

01:57.470 --> 01:58.890
- Wow, small world.
- Yeah.

01:58.900 --> 02:01.010
- Heck, how old's your son?
- Five.

02:01.020 --> 02:03.250
- Wow. Crazy.
- Yeah.

02:03.260 --> 02:04.600
The other day he mentioned that

02:04.610 --> 02:07.350
you were speaking to Kate about a play?

02:07.360 --> 02:09.050
- Yeah, I'm playing you in it.
- Yeah, no, that's not...

02:09.060 --> 02:12.510
Sort of, it's...

02:12.520 --> 02:14.570
Yeah, I didn't think Kate
would tell Mark about that.

02:14.580 --> 02:17.050
- It's not really a play.
- No, it is a play.

02:17.060 --> 02:19.390
I mean, it's a scene in
a play that she wrote,

02:19.400 --> 02:22.070
and it's great.

02:22.560 --> 02:23.700
Is that why you came out here?

02:23.710 --> 02:24.820
No.

02:24.830 --> 02:27.589
Like I said, I was headed
to San Diego on business.

02:27.590 --> 02:29.169
- Oh, San Diego, okay.
- Yeah.

02:29.170 --> 02:31.430
But since I'm here,

02:31.440 --> 02:34.009
is it like something I can see?

02:34.010 --> 02:35.840
- No.
- No, not gonna happen.

02:35.850 --> 02:37.930
Well, because it's not
really like a "show" show.

02:37.940 --> 02:39.870
It's not really like a play.
It's more like a scene,

02:39.880 --> 02:42.690
- and it's kind of more like an exercise.
- It's not an exercise.

02:42.700 --> 02:44.730
- Well, it is. At this point, it's an exercise...
- It's a show we're do...

02:44.740 --> 02:46.450
- We're in this class together...
- But it's gonna be a show that

02:46.460 --> 02:47.650
... we perform in front of people.

02:47.660 --> 02:50.359
- and, um, we're doing this exercise.
- It's a show...

02:50.360 --> 02:53.590
Not really about you. It's
more about me and my life,

02:53.600 --> 02:55.690
and so, it's not really
the kind of thing that...

02:55.700 --> 02:58.600
- I think you'd be bored.
- It's gonna be great.

02:59.650 --> 03:01.280
All right.

03:02.100 --> 03:04.840
Well, anyway, I, uh, take off on Sunday.

03:04.850 --> 03:08.970
I'm staying at the Valley Inn
and Suites, Studio City.

03:08.980 --> 03:11.629
All these cities, right? Why
can't it just be Los Angeles?

03:13.800 --> 03:16.550
- It's good to see you, Sally.
- Yeah.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.750
Hey, nice to meet you, bud.

03:24.350 --> 03:26.300
Nice!

03:26.310 --> 03:28.279
Way to go, Khazam!

03:28.280 --> 03:30.200
Great form, yeah.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.220
Activate your core, though, okay?

03:32.230 --> 03:34.149
Great stuff.

03:34.150 --> 03:36.470
So...

03:36.480 --> 03:39.489
life at stash house has
been super tense, man.

03:39.490 --> 03:42.190
As you know, my favorite flavor...

03:42.200 --> 03:44.579
... of all ice creams is Rocky Road.

03:44.580 --> 03:46.300
And yesterday,

03:46.310 --> 03:48.090
I go to soft-serve machine...

03:48.100 --> 03:52.220
... and Cristobal has had my
favorite replaced with cookie dough.

03:52.230 --> 03:55.009
Which is the favorite
flavor of guess who.

03:55.010 --> 03:56.170
You know how people

03:56.180 --> 03:57.429
start to look like their dogs?

03:57.430 --> 04:01.050
Well, Esther is sporting
very Cristobal-esque hair.

04:01.060 --> 04:03.390
- What the fuck is this?
- And I... Barry?

04:03.400 --> 04:04.890
Aah!

04:04.900 --> 04:06.590
You think this is some fucking game?

04:06.600 --> 04:08.850
Think it's some fucking game, huh?

04:08.860 --> 04:11.510
You lose your focus, you give
the other guy a chance to fire,

04:11.520 --> 04:13.220
you're dead!

04:13.230 --> 04:14.590
Kill!

04:14.600 --> 04:16.720
It's the only word I want
in your fucking head.

04:16.730 --> 04:18.380
Kill.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.680
- We fucking speak English!
- We know what he fucking say!

04:31.690 --> 04:32.919
Go! You fucking...

04:32.920 --> 04:36.680
Your story is that your
father was abducted

04:36.690 --> 04:39.050
and replaced by aliens?

04:39.060 --> 04:40.970
That's what happened.

04:40.980 --> 04:43.349
I'm having a little trouble with that.

04:43.350 --> 04:44.800
You're having a little
trouble with that?

04:44.810 --> 04:47.470
Well, you think... I've had
that trouble my entire life,

04:47.480 --> 04:48.809
- dealing with that, all right?
- Really?

04:48.810 --> 04:50.710
No, I'm gonna act the
vomit. I'm gonna act it.

04:50.720 --> 04:53.090
Um, probably won't see it because
I'll put my head in a toilet.

04:53.100 --> 04:55.109
So you'll just hear like a...

04:55.110 --> 04:57.520
- ... you know, sounds.
- I can make it, I can make it.

04:57.530 --> 04:58.750
- I've done it before.
- I think it's more powerful

04:58.760 --> 05:00.270
if you see it as well.

05:00.280 --> 05:01.300
I think it's more powerful

05:01.310 --> 05:02.739
- if you vomit, actually.
- Yes.

05:02.740 --> 05:05.310
You just put your hands on
me for the last time, Sam.

05:05.320 --> 05:06.390
I'm done with that.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.390
And that's how it's
gonna be from now on.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.690
You hear me?

05:09.700 --> 05:11.220
You wanna choke me?

05:11.230 --> 05:13.550
Well, choke on this: We're done.

05:13.560 --> 05:15.240
You got it?

05:18.400 --> 05:19.870
I... Oh, that's your line.

05:19.880 --> 05:22.640
- It's, "Oh, baby, please... "
- I know, I know, I know, um...

05:22.650 --> 05:24.690
Hey, listen, I'm not trying to be

05:24.700 --> 05:26.400
- a jerk or anything, um...
- Uh-huh?

05:27.270 --> 05:29.590
When we went and had dinner with Sam,

05:29.600 --> 05:32.720
you asked how his... his son was,

05:32.730 --> 05:34.769
and you thanked him for paying the bill.

05:34.770 --> 05:37.840
Yeah, so what? I... I don't
know, I was just being polite.

05:37.850 --> 05:41.000
No, I get it. I-I'm just asking...

05:41.010 --> 05:42.970
Okay, in this you say,

05:42.980 --> 05:44.630
"I don't ever want to see you again,"

05:44.640 --> 05:45.930
- right?
- Mm-hmm.

05:45.940 --> 05:47.750
But then he asked us out to dinner,

05:47.760 --> 05:51.010
and you seemed pretty down for it.

05:51.020 --> 05:52.780
And I was just... I was surprised.

05:54.350 --> 05:55.970
Oh, I don't wanna upset you.

05:55.980 --> 05:57.530
Listen, I'm just...

05:57.540 --> 06:00.470
Do you understand what I'm
saying? I'm just trying to...

06:00.480 --> 06:04.260
I'm just trying to understand
where this is coming from.

06:04.270 --> 06:06.759
Whoa, hey. Sally?

06:06.760 --> 06:08.970
- I can make like a prosthetic head.
- Yes!

06:08.980 --> 06:11.490
That's... In my mind's eye,
that is literally what I saw.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.180
Oh, we'll run a tube through it,
I'll have the vomit come out there.

06:13.190 --> 06:14.600
- Oh, my God, Nat!
- Real vomit.

06:14.610 --> 06:17.450
Hey. Hey, what's wrong?

06:18.310 --> 06:23.450
I never stood up to him.

06:25.030 --> 06:27.800
I mean, he fucking...

06:27.810 --> 06:29.680
he beat the shit out of me, I mean.

06:29.690 --> 06:32.140
He nearly fucking choked me
to death, but I didn't...

06:32.150 --> 06:35.230
I mean, I never... I... I mean...

06:35.240 --> 06:37.340
I mean, I think I curled into
bed with him afterwards.

06:37.350 --> 06:39.500
And I think, I think that I held him.

06:39.510 --> 06:42.549
I mean, I might have even said,
"I love you," for fuck's sake.

06:42.550 --> 06:45.090
I mean, I didn't tell him to
fucking choke on fucking anything.

06:45.100 --> 06:48.140
And then, I mean, eventually,
yeah, I left, but I...

06:48.150 --> 06:50.429
but, I mean, he was asleep.

06:50.430 --> 06:52.680
Hey, but you, left.

06:52.690 --> 06:54.990
Sally, you left, that's
what's important.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.180
Oh, God, I mean, in the
beginning, it was kind of okay,

06:57.190 --> 06:58.720
like for a year, maybe.

06:58.730 --> 07:00.899
But I was fucking 19. I mean,
what the fuck did I know?

07:00.900 --> 07:03.150
I mean, but then it was just,
you know, it was like years

07:03.160 --> 07:05.860
of just like beatings
and apologies and...

07:05.870 --> 07:07.910
and this like vicious kind of cycle

07:07.920 --> 07:10.950
that just kept repeating
itself, but I just...

07:13.020 --> 07:15.070
I mean, I stayed.

07:15.080 --> 07:16.290
Hey...

07:16.300 --> 07:18.339
You know, I wrote it like this because

07:18.340 --> 07:21.130
if I don't do it this way, then
how do I explain to people

07:21.140 --> 07:23.320
that I just like...

07:24.810 --> 07:27.800
like ran away?

07:28.900 --> 07:30.380
You don't have to.

07:31.730 --> 07:34.150
What, you mean like lie?

07:34.900 --> 07:36.190
It's not lying. You said it yourself,

07:36.200 --> 07:38.650
you said you're a strong person.

07:38.660 --> 07:40.530
Yeah, but...

07:41.400 --> 07:43.529
I mean, this? This didn't happen.

07:43.530 --> 07:46.760
Well, yeah, but...

07:46.770 --> 07:49.830
you know, Star Wars didn't
happen and that's a rad movie.

07:51.810 --> 07:55.720
You know, just because
you're in this class...

07:56.940 --> 07:58.820
... it doesn't mean that
you can't have secrets.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.370
You know, you should...

08:02.380 --> 08:06.000
You should be able to be the
person that you say you are.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.630
Like I'm Barry Block.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.180
I'm an actor.

08:14.350 --> 08:16.700
You're Sally Reed,

08:16.710 --> 08:18.550
and you stood up to Sam.

08:18.560 --> 08:22.610
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did. It's okay.

08:26.770 --> 08:28.950
Sally...

08:30.450 --> 08:33.590
You don't think all this
spy game stuff is overkill?

08:33.600 --> 08:35.299
No. You fucked up.

08:35.309 --> 08:37.010
- Now we're out of options.
- Oh. Mm-hmm.

08:37.020 --> 08:39.530
At least this way, I
control the situation.

08:39.539 --> 08:42.640
- Yeah.
- Just get him here, get him talking,

08:42.650 --> 08:45.450
- and I'll do the rest.
- You remember he's a pro, right?

08:45.460 --> 08:46.460
I trained him.

08:46.470 --> 08:48.290
You think he's gonna, you
know, let himself walk

08:48.300 --> 08:49.470
into some kind of situation

08:49.480 --> 08:51.010
where he's gonna blurt everything out?

09:02.310 --> 09:03.770
- Answer it.
- Okay.

09:03.780 --> 09:04.950
Hey, Barry.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.870
Hey, look, I tried that
Braveheart speech,

09:07.880 --> 09:12.610
but, um, apparently that's like
a super popular movie, um...

09:12.620 --> 09:15.370
Do you know of any lesser-known movies

09:15.380 --> 09:16.910
that maybe I could do a speech from?

09:16.920 --> 09:20.650
Uh, no, jeez, Barry. No, not
off the top of my head, no.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.890
Yeah, they just have to
have a good speech in them.

09:22.900 --> 09:25.870
Eric recommended Samuel L. Jackson's
speech from Deep Blue Sea,

09:25.880 --> 09:27.589
but he gets eaten by a
shark midway through it,

09:27.590 --> 09:29.589
so I don't really wanna do that one.

09:29.590 --> 09:31.140
- And then there's Independence Day...
- What?

09:31.150 --> 09:34.280
- Get him here.
- That's what that says?

09:34.320 --> 09:38.809
Get... him... here.

09:38.810 --> 09:41.470
I don't wanna steal
their thunder on that.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.550
Yeah. No, no. No, I hear
what you're saying.

09:43.560 --> 09:46.030
I don't know, man. I'm just...
just a little lost here.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.489
You know what, pal? Why
don't, why don't you come

09:48.490 --> 09:51.890
over here and we'll, you know,
we'll talk about it together?

09:51.900 --> 09:53.659
- Yeah?
- Really? Oh, that'd be great.

09:53.660 --> 09:55.619
That'd be great. Where are you?

09:55.620 --> 09:58.760
Uh, the address? Uh, yeah,
let me find the address.

09:58.770 --> 10:01.590
It's, uh... I'm at the
Hollywood Palm View Motel.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.680
It's near Universal, and the address,

10:03.690 --> 10:05.879
the address is...

10:10.190 --> 10:15.929
The address is 10729 Vineland Avenue.

10:15.930 --> 10:18.010
Vineland. All right, cool.

10:18.020 --> 10:20.640
All right, I'll see you then.
And, hey, Fuches.

10:20.650 --> 10:22.390
- Yeah?
- Uh, thank you.

10:22.400 --> 10:23.510
Thank you. I-I...

10:23.520 --> 10:25.700
I really appreciate this.

10:26.940 --> 10:29.150
Sure, buddy, no problem.

10:42.790 --> 10:44.340
Leo?

10:44.350 --> 10:45.999
Dad, hey.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.540
And to what do I owe this pleasure?

10:47.550 --> 10:50.810
Uh, we had a bunch of
extra strawberries,

10:50.820 --> 10:53.220
and I remembered you
liked them, so, um...

10:53.230 --> 10:55.230
We were gonna have to throw
those out anyway, so I...

10:55.240 --> 10:57.930
Well, that makes me feel wonderful,
'cause no matter what you feel,

10:57.940 --> 10:59.639
I know that I rate above the garbage.

10:59.640 --> 11:02.570
Look, my therapist and my wife
both think this is a bad idea,

11:02.580 --> 11:05.689
but, uh, do you maybe want
to get a meal sometime?

11:05.690 --> 11:07.470
A meal?

11:07.480 --> 11:09.260
Leo and me having a meal?

11:09.270 --> 11:12.279
Okay, I'm gonna AirDrop you my info.

11:12.280 --> 11:15.430
Push that, push that,
and then push send.

11:15.440 --> 11:17.280
- It's on its way.
- Great.

11:18.940 --> 11:21.390
Hey, listen, you wanna
come in for some tea?

11:21.400 --> 11:23.130
- You want some whiskey?
- I-I'm fine.

11:23.140 --> 11:25.249
I know it's early, but you're
still your mother's son.

11:25.250 --> 11:27.510
- I'll call you. Okay, Dad?
- Yeah. Okay.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.000
Hey, Leo.

11:32.090 --> 11:33.760
What made you change your mind?

11:35.770 --> 11:37.219
You made an effort.

11:37.220 --> 11:39.650
- Ah.
- Talk soon.

11:39.660 --> 11:41.950
Oh, I look forward to it.

11:43.190 --> 11:45.630
Uh, Dad, you...

11:45.640 --> 11:47.340
you Airdropped me a
picture of you shirtless,

11:47.350 --> 11:48.360
in front of a mirror.

11:50.480 --> 11:54.090
That's because I was being
fitted for a shirt,

11:54.100 --> 11:57.010
and they wanted to see my, um...

11:57.020 --> 11:58.770
You know what I'm gonna
do? I'm gonna give you

11:58.780 --> 12:01.329
my cell phone number
right now. You ready?

12:01.330 --> 12:03.140
You're a coward, Sam.

12:03.150 --> 12:05.130
You're a small, little man,

12:05.140 --> 12:08.090
and it is a big, big world out there.

12:08.100 --> 12:09.539
And...

12:09.540 --> 12:11.870
... of my life.

12:11.880 --> 12:14.480
So I'm not gonna waste
the rest of my life.

12:14.510 --> 12:17.400
So I'm not gonna waste
the rest of my life.

12:17.440 --> 12:19.590
So I'm not gonna waste
the rest of my life.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.300
That's it.

12:21.310 --> 12:23.340
Life, emphasize life.

12:25.150 --> 12:26.889
I'm not gonna waste the rest of my life

12:26.890 --> 12:28.340
watching it all pass me by.

12:29.900 --> 12:33.779
You wanna choke me, Sam? Hmm? Huh?

12:33.780 --> 12:35.450
Fuck.

12:38.650 --> 12:41.320
- Hey!
- Hey, man.

12:41.330 --> 12:43.699
Hey, Sally said she didn't
want you seeing that.

12:43.700 --> 12:45.220
No, you said you didn't
want me to see it.

12:45.230 --> 12:47.520
- It's my story, I have the right.
- Get out of here, man.

12:47.530 --> 12:49.140
You know how she is. She's a chick.

12:49.150 --> 12:50.760
- She's fucking dramatic.
- All right, let's leave.

12:50.770 --> 12:51.950
I have a family.

12:51.960 --> 12:54.010
This could completely fuck up my life.

12:54.020 --> 12:55.339
She's lucky I don't get
my lawyer involved.

12:55.340 --> 12:57.020
That's your problem, not mine. Go.

13:03.710 --> 13:04.760
Go.

13:05.620 --> 13:07.050
You know, you're a fucking prick, man.

13:07.060 --> 13:08.340
All right.

13:08.350 --> 13:11.300
And don't forget, I fucked her first.

13:11.310 --> 13:14.150
I got it when that shit was tight.

13:36.090 --> 13:38.590
You just hit me for the
last time, Sam. You...

13:38.600 --> 13:41.000
You take a look at these
bruises because...

13:42.480 --> 13:44.370
You just hit me for the last time, Sam.

13:44.380 --> 13:46.130
You take a good look at these bruises,

13:46.140 --> 13:48.510
because I am walking out
that door, and I...

13:52.650 --> 13:55.900
No, you take a good look at my face.

13:56.850 --> 14:01.090
You take a look at my face
for one last time, Sam,

14:01.100 --> 14:03.900
'cause I am...

14:06.190 --> 14:08.240
'Cause I...

14:16.100 --> 14:19.050
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Sam.

14:19.060 --> 14:21.000
Look, I know you don't want to see me,

14:21.010 --> 14:23.050
but I have something that I...

14:23.060 --> 14:25.350
Could you swing by my hotel?

14:25.360 --> 14:26.720
Uh...

14:26.730 --> 14:29.490
No, I don't think that's
gonna happen, Sam.

14:29.500 --> 14:32.290
Well, I wouldn't ask except
I'm moving my flight up,

14:32.300 --> 14:33.810
and I'm leaving tonight.

14:33.820 --> 14:36.380
And I got something, and I want
to give it to you before I leave.

14:37.650 --> 14:39.250
Pick up the torch, dude.

14:39.260 --> 14:43.010
I can't! Oh, my God.

14:43.020 --> 14:46.390
- Why can't I pick it up?
- Because you're terrible.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.079
Ooh, fuck.

14:48.080 --> 14:50.760
- This game sucks!
- You suck, dude.

14:50.770 --> 14:53.740
- Oh, my God, what's happening?
- Yeah, come on, bring it!

14:54.520 --> 14:56.260
I don't know, I...

14:56.270 --> 14:58.760
I don't think this is such a good idea.

14:58.770 --> 15:00.370
Look, if it's such a big deal,

15:00.380 --> 15:02.760
just meet me in the coffee
shop, in the lobby.

15:14.020 --> 15:16.590
Hi, uh, the café is closed, so...

15:16.600 --> 15:18.040
Yeah, I saw that.

15:18.050 --> 15:20.840
Just come up to my room.

15:20.850 --> 15:23.700
Sally, my flight's at 10. I gotta pack.

15:23.710 --> 15:25.900
It'll take two seconds.

15:25.910 --> 15:28.380
Okay. Fine.

15:45.280 --> 15:48.390
- Hey.
- Hi.

15:51.470 --> 15:53.610
Um, what'd you need to give
me? 'Cause I gotta go soon.

15:53.620 --> 15:57.400
Yeah, I know. I, uh, I meant to
give it to you earlier, but...

16:13.770 --> 16:15.550
Oh, my God.

16:15.560 --> 16:17.550
Sophomore year.

16:17.560 --> 16:21.210
I came to all six performances.
You were great.

16:22.520 --> 16:24.379
You can keep it.

16:24.380 --> 16:26.589
Okay. Well, thanks.

16:26.590 --> 16:29.610
Listen, I want to apologize
for coming to LA.

16:29.620 --> 16:31.680
It was crazy.

16:31.690 --> 16:35.300
I have a family. I didn't
want this to upend my life.

16:35.310 --> 16:37.010
Yeah, no one is trying to...

16:37.020 --> 16:38.390
I'm not trying to upend your life.

16:38.400 --> 16:39.840
- That's wasn't...
- I know that. I-I...

16:39.850 --> 16:42.790
I wasn't trusting you, which is crazy.

16:42.800 --> 16:45.900
I wasn't thinking, and
I... I freaked out.

16:46.850 --> 16:49.140
Also, things back home have been hard.

16:49.150 --> 16:51.740
I haven't been in the best headspace.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.620
Well, what's going on at home?

17:05.099 --> 17:07.040
My dad is sick.

17:07.060 --> 17:10.970
Oh, no. Jack's sick?

17:20.150 --> 17:23.050
Look, I hope that he gets better
soon, and, you know, I mean,

17:23.060 --> 17:25.410
keep me posted on how he's doing,

17:25.420 --> 17:27.339
and thanks for the...

17:27.349 --> 17:29.340
I will. Thank you, Sally.

17:29.350 --> 17:31.700
- It's great to see you.
- Yeah.

17:32.820 --> 17:35.170
And, you know, I...

17:35.180 --> 17:37.610
I totally understand
why you were concerned

17:37.620 --> 17:39.690
about my show and me using
your name and stuff,

17:39.700 --> 17:43.410
and I just, I promise to
be respectful of that.

17:43.420 --> 17:45.840
- Okay?
- Thanks.

17:45.850 --> 17:47.589
Take care.

17:47.590 --> 17:49.469
So you won't do the play, then?

17:54.660 --> 17:59.220
No, I'm... I'm doing the play, Sam.

18:04.730 --> 18:07.590
What part of "I have a family"
do you not understand?

18:07.600 --> 18:10.760
- Yeah, it's my story, too.
- Not the made-up part!

18:10.770 --> 18:13.220
- What?
- Yeah, I saw you rehearsing.

18:13.230 --> 18:15.260
That scene is bullshit, Sally.

18:15.270 --> 18:17.020
It never happened, and you know it.

18:18.310 --> 18:20.250
Look, I'll change your name, okay?

18:23.300 --> 18:24.590
You're being dramatic!

18:24.600 --> 18:26.260
You're just doing this to get attention!

18:26.270 --> 18:27.510
So how about no, huh?

18:27.520 --> 18:30.860
How about you just grow
up and don't do it?

18:41.080 --> 18:44.519
Yeah, run away, just like before!

18:44.520 --> 18:47.050
Tell everyone how you
kicked my ass or something!

18:47.060 --> 18:50.220
Everyone's the hero of
their own story, right?

18:50.230 --> 18:52.060
Lying bitch!

19:14.400 --> 19:15.969
What the fuck? Where is he?

19:15.970 --> 19:19.010
I don't know. I'm not his mother.

19:19.020 --> 19:22.660
- Maybe he's not coming.
- You said you built his mind!

19:22.670 --> 19:25.260
Aah! Fuck!

19:28.810 --> 19:31.340
Yeah, well... maybe you spooked him!

19:31.350 --> 19:32.650
You ever think of that? Huh?

19:33.420 --> 19:35.739
Nice job, dipshit!

19:38.770 --> 19:40.930
- Barry?
- Hey. Hey, Fuches.

19:40.940 --> 19:43.090
Hey, listen, man. I need to talk to you.

19:43.100 --> 19:44.520
Just listen, okay?

19:44.530 --> 19:47.010
Do not come here, you got it?
And do not call me again.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.840
I cannot talk to you, do you understand?

19:48.850 --> 19:50.300
No, but Fuches, I...

19:50.310 --> 19:52.220
Look, I almost did something
really stupid, man, and I...

19:52.230 --> 19:55.050
I am blocking your number.
Do not contact me anymore.

19:55.060 --> 19:56.100
What?

20:13.850 --> 20:15.720
Hey.

20:15.730 --> 20:18.239
Hey, it's Barry Berkman.

20:18.240 --> 20:22.510
Look, today a guy...
said something to me,

20:22.520 --> 20:24.650
and it, uh, made me mad.

20:24.660 --> 20:27.340
What'd you do? You thump him up, huh?

20:27.350 --> 20:29.210
Did you throw him a little high heat?

20:29.220 --> 20:30.379
A little chin music?

20:30.380 --> 20:34.350
Hey, Barry, we're both alphas.

20:34.360 --> 20:35.590
I understand.

20:35.600 --> 20:40.620
No, no that's not what I
did. Look, when I, uh...

20:40.630 --> 20:44.140
When I get angry, I don't
like who I become.

20:45.600 --> 20:48.680
Can I... Can I be totally
honest with you?

20:48.690 --> 20:51.800
Barry, this is becoming
a little frustrating.

20:51.810 --> 20:55.010
You finally open up to me,
you tell me this great story

20:55.020 --> 20:56.690
about shooting a sheep-fucker,

20:56.700 --> 20:58.300
then all of a sudden,
you don't wanna do it.

20:58.310 --> 21:00.700
So you start talking about
our friend, Albert.

21:01.650 --> 21:03.900
Then you leave that,
and all of a sudden,

21:03.910 --> 21:07.340
it devolves into some kind
of Braveheart bullshit.

21:07.350 --> 21:09.050
For the love of God, Barry,

21:09.060 --> 21:12.340
would you pick one horse and ride it?

21:12.350 --> 21:14.420
Now what happened with Albert?

21:24.440 --> 21:27.760
Listen to me, son. There
are no accidents.

21:27.770 --> 21:30.729
You started writing this
story for a reason.

21:30.730 --> 21:34.890
The very same reason
you came here tonight.

21:34.900 --> 21:37.569
You want to tell this story.

21:37.570 --> 21:40.569
You need to tell this story.

21:42.650 --> 21:44.829
You'll look at me differently.

21:44.830 --> 21:49.659
I promise you, I will not
look at you differently.

21:49.660 --> 21:53.090
What happened?

21:58.550 --> 22:01.509
Oh, my God. Albert, Albert!
You're going into shock, man.

22:18.980 --> 22:21.400
Can't see 'em! Can't see 'em!

22:22.740 --> 22:24.640
Berkman! What are you doing?

22:28.080 --> 22:29.640
Fucking, you fuck!

22:29.650 --> 22:31.160
You fuck!

22:31.170 --> 22:33.140
- That's right, you fuck!
- Barry, no!

22:33.150 --> 22:35.580
Barry, what the fuck are you doing?

22:35.590 --> 22:37.470
What? He fucking shot Albert!

22:37.480 --> 22:39.339
Barry, stop! It's not the guy!

22:39.340 --> 22:41.270
What the fuck is wrong with
you? Are you fucking insane?

22:41.280 --> 22:44.460
They were across the street on
the roof, you fucking psycho!

22:48.020 --> 22:51.110
Then they sent me to a
hospital in Germany.

22:52.480 --> 22:54.140
And, uh...

22:54.150 --> 22:57.270
a family friend pulled some
strings and got me discharged.

22:58.650 --> 23:00.900
After that, I, um...

23:04.040 --> 23:07.380
I didn't feel like I
deserved a good life.

23:11.020 --> 23:12.660
Holy shit.

23:14.180 --> 23:16.039
Fuck!

23:16.040 --> 23:17.950
Fu...

23:18.520 --> 23:21.180
Who else did you tell this story to?

23:21.190 --> 23:23.800
- In class? No one.
- Good.

23:23.810 --> 23:25.180
So here's my advice:

23:25.190 --> 23:28.050
You never tell that story
again as long as you live,

23:28.060 --> 23:30.840
'cause basically, you killed somebody,

23:30.850 --> 23:32.630
and you got away with it.

23:32.640 --> 23:33.670
See, this is why I
didn't wanna tell you.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.310
'Cause you're gonna
look at me differently.

23:35.320 --> 23:37.729
You're gonna look at me
like I'm a murderer,

23:37.730 --> 23:40.320
- like I'm a violent piece of shit.
- Barry.

23:41.240 --> 23:43.060
Listen to me.

23:48.020 --> 23:50.340
I have a son.

23:50.350 --> 23:53.159
I was terrible to this son.

23:53.160 --> 23:57.180
I was cruel, I was selfish,

23:57.190 --> 23:59.839
and there's nothing I
can do to change that.

23:59.840 --> 24:03.299
But I don't wanna be that guy anymore.

24:03.300 --> 24:09.240
And I pray that human beings
can change their nature.

24:10.350 --> 24:12.840
Because if we can't,

24:12.850 --> 24:15.260
then you and I are in deep trouble.

24:16.100 --> 24:18.850
Well, how do we do that?

24:18.860 --> 24:22.550
I think we're doing it already.

24:22.560 --> 24:24.930
You didn't beat that guy up, did you?

24:24.940 --> 24:26.990
You came here.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.890
We're talking about your feelings

24:29.900 --> 24:33.030
instead of acting out your feelings.

24:33.600 --> 24:35.030
And as for my son,

24:35.040 --> 24:37.130
the first time I reached out to him

24:37.140 --> 24:38.720
after years and years and years,

24:38.730 --> 24:41.760
I got a big, "Fuck you, Dad!"

24:41.770 --> 24:45.460
But today, today...

24:45.470 --> 24:48.700
he brought me strawberries.

24:53.300 --> 24:56.710
Do you think I'm a bad
person, Mr. Cousineau?

24:56.720 --> 25:01.680
I think you're deeply human.

25:01.690 --> 25:04.260
You did a terrible thing,

25:04.270 --> 25:07.190
but do I think that defines you?

25:07.200 --> 25:09.140
No.

25:09.150 --> 25:11.430
That's why I don't think you should tell

25:11.440 --> 25:14.699
this story in front of the class.

25:14.700 --> 25:16.680
Also, they will shit themselves.

25:16.690 --> 25:17.960
I mean, they're children.

25:21.150 --> 25:23.340
So we're gonna be okay?

25:23.350 --> 25:25.780
I promise you, we're...

25:27.480 --> 25:31.010
We're gonna work through this, okay?

25:31.020 --> 25:32.200
Do you trust me?

25:32.210 --> 25:33.889
Mm-hmm.

25:33.890 --> 25:35.430
Yeah.

25:40.150 --> 25:45.149
Now, I bill my private classes
through another loan out.

25:45.150 --> 25:47.800
So I'm just gonna go
and get that ledger.

25:47.810 --> 25:49.820
Okay.

26:18.520 --> 26:20.940
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

26:39.520 --> 26:41.920
Aah. Shit.

26:46.720 --> 26:49.360
It's... I...

26:50.630 --> 26:52.900
Okay, okay.

26:52.910 --> 26:54.200
All right.

26:56.190 --> 26:57.360
Fuches!

26:59.360 --> 27:00.490
Barry?

27:00.500 --> 27:02.180
Hey, what are you doing up there?

27:02.190 --> 27:03.930
Uh, I...

27:03.940 --> 27:06.019
I can't find something.

27:06.020 --> 27:07.399
Hey, I gotta tell you something.

27:07.400 --> 27:09.990
- Now?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.320
- I'll come up. I'll come up.
- No, wait, wait, wait!

27:12.360 --> 27:15.240
No...

27:16.560 --> 27:17.890
- Fuches.
- Aah!

27:17.900 --> 27:19.579
- Hey, you're not gonna believe this.
- What?

27:19.580 --> 27:21.090
The best thing happened. It's amazing!

27:21.100 --> 27:24.459
Barry, no. Barry, no,
no. Shit, shit, no.

27:24.460 --> 27:27.240
No!

27:27.840 --> 27:29.419
Fuck!

27:29.420 --> 27:31.690
- Okay. I know you don't want me calling.
- Barry...

27:31.700 --> 27:33.590
- That's why I came here. But listen, listen.
- Barry, just...

27:33.600 --> 27:35.219
I told Mr. Cousineau about Korengal.

27:35.220 --> 27:38.230
He accepted me. He said
that I... What did he say?

27:38.240 --> 27:40.490
He said I can change my nature.
Do you know what that means?

27:40.500 --> 27:42.930
- I-I know.
- That means that I can own all this stuff

27:42.940 --> 27:44.059
- that we've been talking about.
- Barry...

27:44.060 --> 27:46.680
All these things that I
don't like about myself,

27:46.690 --> 27:48.260
that I can own them and
they don't define me.

27:48.270 --> 27:50.050
Like, you know, what
happened in the war,

27:50.060 --> 27:52.370
what we do together, even the
things I don't like about myself

27:52.380 --> 27:53.529
- that I regret like killing Moss.
- No.

27:53.530 --> 27:57.140
I don't have to live with
that regret anymore.

27:57.150 --> 27:58.470
I can move past it.

27:58.480 --> 28:01.570
I'm not a violent piece of
shit is what I'm saying.

28:02.540 --> 28:03.840
What?

28:06.000 --> 28:08.630
Hey, Barry.

28:08.640 --> 28:12.860
Hey, Fuches, why don't
you give us a moment?

28:16.440 --> 28:18.280
Barry...

28:19.310 --> 28:20.429
Get out.

28:20.430 --> 28:23.990
I'm sorr... I'm sorry.

28:24.600 --> 28:26.780
Fuches...

28:28.760 --> 28:30.860
Sit down, Berkman.

28:33.340 --> 28:34.860
Sit down!

28:46.420 --> 28:47.760
I got you.

28:47.810 --> 28:50.200
I got you, Berkman.

28:50.220 --> 28:53.070
You are so fucked.

28:53.080 --> 28:55.550
I know that was you on the lipstick cam.

28:55.560 --> 28:56.590
Yeah.

28:57.720 --> 28:59.890
And Moss was on to you,

28:59.900 --> 29:01.520
so you killed her.

29:01.530 --> 29:02.720
Please, Let me talk to him!

29:02.730 --> 29:04.360
Shut up!

29:09.060 --> 29:13.010
Tape's off, so it's just you and me.

29:13.020 --> 29:14.720
Yeah.

29:14.730 --> 29:17.520
Okay, I'm gonna do this.

29:17.530 --> 29:18.900
You thought of everything,
you thought of everything,

29:18.910 --> 29:20.900
so there's nothing left to do.

29:20.910 --> 29:23.680
That's how it goes. It's all worked out,

29:23.690 --> 29:26.050
It's all worked out, so, yeah...

29:26.060 --> 29:28.970
You went over it and over
it, and so now's the time.

29:30.180 --> 29:31.919
Hey, Loach, don't do anything stupid.

29:31.920 --> 29:34.390
- Loach!
- Shut up!

29:34.400 --> 29:37.150
Do you have any idea what it's like

29:37.160 --> 29:39.930
to fucking love somebody
and have some motherfucker

29:39.940 --> 29:43.150
come along and take them
away from you? Do you?

29:45.060 --> 29:46.970
I'm sorry about Janice.

29:48.560 --> 29:50.900
Not-Not Moss?

29:53.320 --> 29:55.430
That's Ronnie Proxin.

29:55.440 --> 29:58.430
He's fucking my wife.

29:58.440 --> 30:02.240
You get rid of him, all
of this goes away.

30:05.560 --> 30:06.939
What?!

30:06.940 --> 30:11.940

31:23.360 --> 31:24.970
Your name's Ronnie Proxin, right?

31:24.980 --> 31:26.260
- Uh-huh.
- Don't freak out.

31:26.270 --> 31:28.470
I've been sent here to kill you.

31:28.480 --> 31:29.640
I'm not gonna do that.

31:29.650 --> 31:30.920
Calling an audible right now.

31:30.930 --> 31:33.930
Oh, okay, so, I want you
to drive to Chicago,

31:33.940 --> 31:37.669
and I need you to stay
there... for about a year.

31:37.670 --> 31:39.879
- Mm.
- Do you have a suitcase?

31:42.940 --> 31:44.780
Today, a guy...

31:45.480 --> 31:48.639
said something to me and
it, uh, made me mad.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.550
What'd you do? You thump him up?

31:50.560 --> 31:53.250
Huh? Did you throw him
a little high heat?

31:53.260 --> 31:55.050
A little chin music?

31:55.060 --> 31:56.780
Hey, Barry.

31:56.850 --> 31:58.590
We're both alphas.

31:58.600 --> 32:00.190
I understand.

32:00.850 --> 32:03.069
This episode has a scene in
the show, which I think's

32:03.070 --> 32:04.779
probably the linchpin
of the whole season.

32:04.780 --> 32:07.290
Barry tells Cousineau his truth,

32:07.300 --> 32:08.720
and Cousineau gives that speech.

32:08.730 --> 32:13.159
I pray that human beings
can change their nature

32:13.160 --> 32:16.999
because if we can't, then you
and I are in deep trouble.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.419
He's saying it to Barry,

32:18.420 --> 32:20.629
but every character's
kinda going through that.

32:20.630 --> 32:22.100
Barry and Cousineau, obviously.

32:22.110 --> 32:23.509
Sally with her ex,

32:23.510 --> 32:26.070
and trying to front as, like,
she's a strong person,

32:26.080 --> 32:28.589
but trying... having a hard time
admitting that she was weak.

32:28.590 --> 32:31.470
And how do I explain to
people that I just, like...

32:31.480 --> 32:33.110
like, ran away?

32:33.480 --> 32:35.429
She's very ashamed about that, right?

32:35.430 --> 32:37.470
- Incredibly ashamed by it, yeah.
- The person she is today

32:37.480 --> 32:38.720
wouldn't behave that way.

32:38.730 --> 32:41.490
- I like that scene for Barry a lot.
- Yeah.

32:41.500 --> 32:43.090
'Cause he's just like,
"Well, wait a second."

32:43.100 --> 32:44.640
- You don't have to.
- I mean, this?

32:44.650 --> 32:45.990
What... this didn't happen.

32:46.730 --> 32:48.350
You know, Star Wars didn't happen,

32:48.360 --> 32:49.659
and that's a rad movie.

32:49.660 --> 32:51.680
- Come to the dark side of...
- Yeah.

32:51.690 --> 32:54.400
of denial and... You know?

32:54.410 --> 32:58.390
It ends up undermining her
ability to confront Sam.

32:58.400 --> 32:59.670
That scene is bullshit.

32:59.680 --> 33:01.090
It never happened, and you know it.

33:01.100 --> 33:04.129
He's yelling at her for
putting her "truth" onstage.

33:04.130 --> 33:07.009
He has a legitimate point
that she's fictionalizing it.

33:07.010 --> 33:08.200
Don't do it!

33:08.210 --> 33:11.259
We had this thing in season one
about Loach having an ex-wife,

33:11.260 --> 33:13.970
and we thought, "Oh, wouldn't
it be interesting if... "

33:13.980 --> 33:17.590
That's Ronnie Proxin.
If you get rid of him...

33:17.600 --> 33:19.060
all of this goes away.

33:19.480 --> 33:20.559
What?!

33:20.560 --> 33:22.229
When we started season two writing,

33:22.230 --> 33:24.069
that was one of the tentpole things.

33:24.070 --> 33:25.980
The first half of the
season, you felt like

33:25.990 --> 33:27.900
Loach was gaining on Barry,

33:27.910 --> 33:29.350
and then you do that twist,

33:29.360 --> 33:31.190
that then when you went
back and watch the scenes,

33:31.200 --> 33:33.470
you realize, this is why
he's doing all this stuff

33:33.480 --> 33:35.850
- is to get all this information on Barry.
- I got you.

33:35.860 --> 33:38.330
So he can have Barry
perform a hit for him.
