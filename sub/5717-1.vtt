WEBVTT

00:03.278 --> 00:04.305
Here.

00:04.425 --> 00:07.185
Last season,
on A Place to Call Home...

00:07.945 --> 00:09.985
You promise me George
and then renege.

00:10.065 --> 00:11.825
We're cut from the same cloth.

00:11.905 --> 00:14.505
The deed to Ash Park.

00:14.585 --> 00:17.985
I shall be leaving, tomorrow.

00:18.065 --> 00:19.905
Keep an eye on her.

00:20.025 --> 00:24.105
I have no idea
who Elizabeth Bligh really is.

00:24.185 --> 00:25.585
I look forward to meeting her.

00:25.705 --> 00:28.665
It won't be easy carrying
your dead child to term.

00:28.785 --> 00:31.705
Jarvis finds a girl in trouble,
with an imminent delivery,

00:31.825 --> 00:35.225
and you emerge with a bonny,
bouncing babe in your arms.

00:35.345 --> 00:38.745
You look happy.
I am.

00:40.545 --> 00:43.265
There is a cancer
at the heart of your family.

00:43.385 --> 00:46.385
That guarantees sleepless nights
whether you open it or not.

00:46.465 --> 00:47.945
So which will it be?

00:48.025 --> 00:50.505
Worrying or wondering?

00:50.625 --> 00:53.225
Carolyn Bligh...
Please, don't.

00:53.305 --> 00:54.905
Don't do what I think you're doing.

00:55.025 --> 00:57.625
I love you.
I always will.

00:57.705 --> 00:59.065
I did love George.

01:16.825 --> 01:18.585
George?

01:18.705 --> 01:20.385
George, it's Sarah.
Stay back!

01:20.505 --> 01:23.185
George, try and stay awake.
What happened?

01:23.305 --> 01:25.545
Rene! The gun, it went off!

01:25.665 --> 01:29.345
Rene, what are you doing?

01:29.465 --> 01:31.465
Help me.

01:31.585 --> 01:33.545
Do something!

01:33.665 --> 01:36.705
I can't.
George is losing too much blood.

01:36.825 --> 01:38.265
Rene, stop! No!

01:38.345 --> 01:39.785
Rene!

01:39.905 --> 01:43.305
I'm warning you!
What the blazes!

01:43.425 --> 01:45.425
He shot George!
Easy, easy, easy!

01:45.505 --> 01:47.505
We need help! An ambulance. Jack!

01:47.625 --> 01:51.585
Regina, ride to Ash Park!
Call an ambulance!

01:51.665 --> 01:53.145
No! Get away from him!

01:53.265 --> 01:55.585
I need to be the one helping him.
Stop!

01:55.705 --> 01:58.065
You shouldn't be here.
I'm not leaving him.

01:59.745 --> 02:01.025
Regina, he could die.

02:04.545 --> 02:08.664
Tell Jack to bring IV fluids. Go!

02:09.505 --> 02:12.425
Finally, he sleeps.

02:12.505 --> 02:14.265
Thanks to his wonderful mother.

02:15.865 --> 02:18.625
Hardly.

02:18.705 --> 02:21.625
I mean, I love him to pieces,

02:21.745 --> 02:24.305
but I never dreamed it
would be this difficult.

02:24.425 --> 02:28.025
James had a hearty set of lungs
on him, too, at Georgie's age.

02:28.105 --> 02:30.345
Well, at least I had perfect pitch.

02:30.465 --> 02:33.585
Father told me about your
school's production of 'The Mikado'.

02:33.665 --> 02:35.505
I was fabulous. Everyone said so.

02:40.745 --> 02:43.145
Help! Help! Come quickly!

02:46.905 --> 02:49.785
Call Jack! Tell him to hurry.
George has been shot.

02:49.905 --> 02:51.585
What?
How?

02:51.705 --> 02:54.705
On the far boundary. There was
an argument. That mad Nordmann.

02:54.825 --> 02:57.305
She said to bring fluids.
I'll telephone Jack

02:57.425 --> 02:59.785
and the police.
Who's 'she'?

02:59.905 --> 03:01.825
The nurse.
Sarah's with George?

03:03.425 --> 03:04.985
Regina, come inside.

03:05.105 --> 03:08.425
I can't!
Regina!

03:08.505 --> 03:10.185
Regina!

03:16.105 --> 03:18.625
One, two, three.

03:18.745 --> 03:21.065
The entry point is central.
It could be spinal.

03:21.185 --> 03:23.185
He has to go to Sydney.
Sydney? Are you sure?

03:23.265 --> 03:24.825
We've no choice.

03:24.945 --> 03:28.145
Then I'll go with him.
Well, aren't you needed here?

03:28.265 --> 03:30.465
Just trying to sort out
what happened.

03:31.631 --> 03:33.591
Jack, if the bullet moves...
I'll look after Rene.

03:33.665 --> 03:35.505
Try to keep him immobile.

03:35.585 --> 03:37.025
Jack, this is out of the question.

03:37.145 --> 03:39.025
There's no time.
And keep his fluids up.

03:39.145 --> 03:42.745
Tell Rene I'll be back as soon
as I can.

03:43.505 --> 03:45.705
Stay with him.

03:47.145 --> 03:49.425
You drive carefully.

03:53.705 --> 03:55.425
I'll telephone
as soon as I know anything.

03:55.505 --> 03:57.265
It's all we'll be thinking about.

04:00.145 --> 04:04.065
James, your father will weather
this. I know it.

04:04.185 --> 04:06.865
What would I do without you?
Let's go, James!

04:15.905 --> 04:17.704
Will I telephone Elizabeth?

04:17.825 --> 04:20.105
Tell her what's happened?
Would you? And Anna?

04:20.185 --> 04:22.505
She'd want to know.

04:22.625 --> 04:24.265
Poor thing just married
and now this.

04:24.385 --> 04:27.945
Perhaps we should wait
until we know if...

04:28.065 --> 04:30.705
Until we find out
what happens with George.

04:30.785 --> 04:32.585
Let her have some happiness.

04:43.185 --> 04:44.825
I think it thrilling.

04:44.945 --> 04:46.265
You do?
Mm-hm.

04:46.345 --> 04:47.545
Oh, thank you.

04:47.625 --> 04:49.785
But, my dear, how will you cope?

04:49.905 --> 04:53.705
I mean, no home
and no domestic staff?

04:57.025 --> 05:01.305
Well, if a woman like Freya Stark
can cross the Middle East,
I can do without a maid.

05:01.665 --> 05:04.545
You and your
lady adventurers. Oh.

05:04.665 --> 05:09.065
Well, how can not one be inspired,
the way they take on the world?

05:09.185 --> 05:11.865
But what will you do?

05:11.945 --> 05:14.785
The world is my oyster.

05:14.905 --> 05:17.745
How modern.
Excuse me, Mrs Bligh?

05:17.825 --> 05:20.665
Telephone. It's urgent.

05:27.185 --> 05:28.785
Eliz...

05:28.865 --> 05:31.705
Olivia?

05:31.785 --> 05:36.145
George, shot? I... I don't...

05:36.985 --> 05:39.825
Dr Nordmann?

05:39.905 --> 05:44.145
Um, yes, as soon as I can.

05:49.465 --> 05:52.385
His pulse is weak and thready.

05:54.425 --> 05:56.745
We have to take the bullet out.

05:56.865 --> 05:59.425
You're not serious.
It's causing more damage.

06:01.625 --> 06:03.865
Just...
Hey, what are you doing?

06:07.705 --> 06:10.564
I can't reach it.
You're going to kill him.

06:10.565 --> 06:11.665
Stay with me, George.

06:11.719 --> 06:13.840
Come on, we need something sharp
to open up the wound.

06:13.945 --> 06:17.505
Wire, or anything.
Look for something. Quickly!

06:18.705 --> 06:20.945
OK, stay with me, George.
Stay with me, that's it.

06:21.585 --> 06:22.945
You're doing really well.

06:24.865 --> 06:29.385
OK. OK. I'm sorry, George.

06:31.465 --> 06:34.345
OK.

06:34.425 --> 06:36.145
You're OK. It's OK.

06:43.465 --> 06:46.745
Got it.

06:46.825 --> 06:49.745
OK, bandages, quickly.

06:51.385 --> 06:53.105
You did really well.
Here.

06:53.185 --> 06:55.185
OK, thanks.

06:55.265 --> 06:56.325
That's it.

07:18.345 --> 07:19.985
Rene, Rene, it's Jack.

07:20.105 --> 07:23.065
It'll be OK.

07:23.145 --> 07:25.585
You're safe, Rene. The war's over.

07:25.705 --> 07:27.665
You'll be right.
Get him inside.

07:29.385 --> 07:32.385
What is wrong with him?
A head injury. He gets...

07:32.465 --> 07:34.545
confused.

07:35.985 --> 07:37.065
He's a decent bloke, Eddie.

07:37.185 --> 07:39.025
He's French.
He needs to be in hospital.

07:39.105 --> 07:40.745
Not when he's facing murder charges.

07:40.865 --> 07:42.385
Come on, Eddie,
the bloke's not well.

07:42.465 --> 07:44.105
Well, then get him a lawyer.

07:52.825 --> 07:54.425
Bella mia!

07:54.545 --> 07:57.785
I have a special surprise for you.
Oh, husband!

07:57.905 --> 08:00.465
You look obscenely happy.
Papa's best vintage.

08:00.545 --> 08:01.865
He'll kill you.

08:01.985 --> 08:03.985
Oh, we are honeymooning, no?
We deserve it.

08:04.105 --> 08:06.585
Mm. Not for me.
What's wrong?

08:06.665 --> 08:08.545
I don't know, I just...

08:08.665 --> 08:11.625
I feel a little bit off-colour,
that's all.

08:11.745 --> 08:14.385
You aren't...
What?

08:14.505 --> 08:18.345
A bambino?
No, no not...

08:18.425 --> 08:20.905
Not yet, anyway.

08:21.025 --> 08:24.265
Then what?
It's nothing.

08:24.345 --> 08:26.785
Anna, please.

08:27.305 --> 08:31.305
No, I can't. It's too embarrassing.

08:31.425 --> 08:33.825
I don't know what to wear
to the theatre.

08:33.945 --> 08:36.664
Does that make me seem
terribly frivolous?

08:36.745 --> 08:39.105
Amore, never, hmm?

08:51.465 --> 08:53.305
He's suffered a gunshot wound
to the abdomen.

08:53.425 --> 08:55.825
I've given him two pints of fluid.
Blood pressure?

08:55.945 --> 08:59.345
Stabilising,
but there was substantial blood loss.

08:59.425 --> 09:00.505
The bullet's mobile?

09:00.665 --> 09:05.585
No, I removed it. In a moving
ambulance? You took quite a risk.

09:05.705 --> 09:08.785
I thought the intervention justified
to keep him alive.

09:08.905 --> 09:11.025
That's quite possibly
what you've done, Sister...

09:11.185 --> 09:14.865
Nordmann. The object I used to open
the wound wasn't sterile. Good to know.

09:17.425 --> 09:19.345
Stay with us, George.
Sister? Go.

09:22.025 --> 09:23.705
Let's get you cleaned up.

09:23.785 --> 09:25.265
Sarah.

09:26.945 --> 09:29.665
Elizabeth.
How is he?

09:30.425 --> 09:32.065
They're taking him into theatre.

09:32.225 --> 09:36.545
How could your husband, a disturbed man,
gain possession of a gun?

09:36.625 --> 09:39.705
I can't understand it.

09:39.825 --> 09:42.105
Oh, if anything happens to George,
I would...

09:42.185 --> 09:45.145
Let's find you a change of clothes.

09:48.025 --> 09:49.625
Is there any news?

09:51.945 --> 09:54.745
I shouldn't have left Ash Park.

10:01.905 --> 10:04.065
Thank you, Mrs Standish.
Let's get this over with.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.465
I should be on my way to Sydney.

10:06.585 --> 10:10.025
Of course. As soon as we sort out
what happened.

10:10.145 --> 10:13.345
I told you what I know.
That madman shot George Bligh.

10:13.465 --> 10:17.665
Well, can you tell me again, from
the beginning? So that it's clear.

10:19.985 --> 10:24.065
I just... I don't know.

10:24.225 --> 10:26.425
Point that away, man!
It happened so quickly.

10:26.505 --> 10:28.585
No, you can't do this!

10:31.425 --> 10:35.705
Mrs Standish,
you remembered something?

10:44.145 --> 10:46.665
It's important.

10:46.785 --> 10:49.545
If the Frenchman deliberately shot
Mr Bligh,

10:49.625 --> 10:51.585
he'll face the death penalty.

10:51.665 --> 10:53.865
You're the only witness.

10:55.505 --> 10:58.905
Are you saying
that Communist Jew could hang?

10:59.345 --> 11:02.265
He's a Red?
One hears things.

11:02.425 --> 11:06.745
I mean to say, the French - who knows
where their sympathies really lie?

11:06.825 --> 11:08.425
Jewish as well, eh?

11:08.545 --> 11:12.225
We all know what that kind
will do to serve their purpose.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.785
As bad as the Nazis, half of them.

11:16.465 --> 11:18.705
About the shooting.

11:20.865 --> 11:24.465
I'm afraid I can't be of more help.

11:24.545 --> 11:25.825
It's still rather a blur.

11:29.185 --> 11:31.465
Well, perhaps it'll become clearer.

11:31.545 --> 11:33.345
Perhaps.

11:33.465 --> 11:36.945
I'll telephone the moment it does.
Thank you.

11:37.985 --> 11:39.185
Thank you, Sergeant.

12:00.865 --> 12:03.745
I should have telephoned Dr Cargill,

12:03.865 --> 12:07.545
had George transferred
to a private hospital.

12:07.625 --> 12:10.345
Rifles don't just go off.

12:10.425 --> 12:12.505
How did Regina explain it?

12:12.585 --> 12:15.185
She didn't say. She was too upset.

12:17.625 --> 12:21.025
Did I not ask you
to keep an eye on her?

12:21.105 --> 12:22.625
Really, Mother?

12:25.625 --> 12:27.785
Regina will twist this
to her advantage.

12:27.865 --> 12:29.385
Thank you.

12:33.945 --> 12:36.265
Please, I...
I don't want us to be at odds.

12:36.345 --> 12:38.025
Not at a time like this.

12:38.105 --> 12:42.105
Having a child in danger is a...

12:42.185 --> 12:44.265
It's a terrible thing.

12:44.385 --> 12:48.225
I didn't consider how difficult
this must be for you.

12:48.305 --> 12:50.385
Please forgive me.

12:50.465 --> 12:52.025
Of course.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.625
But I must get back. Rene is...

12:53.785 --> 12:56.865
Oh, he'll need his wife, yes.
Norman will drive you. I...

12:56.945 --> 12:59.705
I insist.

12:59.785 --> 13:02.545
I so appreciate what you've done.

13:02.625 --> 13:04.425
I did what anyone would do.

13:04.545 --> 13:10.465
Oh, I think we can agree that
that's a modest assessment.

13:10.545 --> 13:13.025
Let me do this for you, please.

13:13.865 --> 13:14.865
Thank you.

13:32.548 --> 13:34.948
Mate, eat something, hey?

13:34.991 --> 13:37.027
Keep your strength up.

13:40.988 --> 13:42.428
Sarah will be back soon.

13:49.347 --> 13:52.307
It's all here for you, Rene.

13:52.387 --> 13:54.827
A new life.

14:04.027 --> 14:06.576
I know you're protecting yourself
from those god-awful memories.

14:12.787 --> 14:14.427
You can put all those behind you.

14:16.067 --> 14:17.987
It is possible.

14:20.467 --> 14:21.987
You can't let them
get on top of you, mate.

14:22.107 --> 14:24.067
You can't live in the past.
You just can't.

15:26.307 --> 15:28.147
What happened?

15:28.227 --> 15:30.267
I need to know.

15:30.347 --> 15:32.667
I told the police I don't remember.

15:32.787 --> 15:35.187
Did he shoot George deliberately
or not?

15:35.342 --> 15:36.622
That depends.

15:36.703 --> 15:39.063
On what?

15:41.502 --> 15:44.342
Did you know he's facing
a death sentence if George dies?

15:44.422 --> 15:45.927
Something must have happened.

15:45.928 --> 15:48.076
Perhaps he realised his wife
was in love with another man

15:48.080 --> 15:49.742
and decided to eliminate
the competition.

15:49.743 --> 15:52.310
No, not Rene. He wouldn't.
No, you're right.

15:52.390 --> 15:53.450
George probably got hurt

15:53.470 --> 15:55.830
trying to wrestle the gun
from a suicidal maniac...

15:55.910 --> 15:57.470
What is it you want, Regina?

16:00.110 --> 16:05.870
If George dies, I'm going to make
sure your husband hangs.

16:08.190 --> 16:09.990
And if he lives?

16:11.310 --> 16:13.310
I'll tell them it was an accident.

16:14.870 --> 16:16.390
I see.

16:17.550 --> 16:19.350
You'll get your mad Jew back,

16:19.470 --> 16:23.190
and who knows where George
turns to for comfort. Shalom.

16:26.950 --> 16:28.190
He knows who you are.

16:51.310 --> 16:52.790
How's George? Any news?

16:52.870 --> 16:54.430
He's gone into surgery.

16:54.510 --> 16:56.030
And Rene?

16:59.270 --> 17:02.830
What an unspeakable tragedy. The
whole town is praying for Mr Bligh.

17:02.910 --> 17:04.670
I'm sure he appreciates it, Doris.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.990
And we understand that you were
instrumental in saving him.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.310
You were there!
I need to see my husband.

17:09.430 --> 17:11.354
I don't believe a word
of what they're saying.

17:11.354 --> 17:12.710
It can't be true.

17:12.790 --> 17:14.349
And what are they saying?

17:14.470 --> 17:16.710
This unsavoury mistrust
of foreigners.

17:16.829 --> 17:19.349
If there's anything
I can do to help...

17:22.630 --> 17:25.390
No visitors.
He's not well. Let me through.

17:26.990 --> 17:30.590
That the defence, is it?
I wasn't aware my husband was on trial.

17:32.390 --> 17:34.087
You won't get any sense out of him.

17:52.990 --> 17:54.430
Rene?

17:55.230 --> 17:56.750
Mon cheri.

17:59.670 --> 18:03.110
It's me. Sarah.

18:15.070 --> 18:16.590
Remember.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.670
Sarah?

18:23.150 --> 18:24.350
Yes.

18:26.790 --> 18:28.630
Yes.

18:54.470 --> 18:56.390
There you are.

19:06.550 --> 19:09.710
We will find a way through this,
you and I.

19:12.510 --> 19:13.762
We will.

19:13.763 --> 19:17.270
Alright. Time.

19:18.670 --> 19:19.910
I said time!

19:19.990 --> 19:21.390
I'll be back soon.

19:28.350 --> 19:29.550
Rene, you're safe.

19:32.630 --> 19:35.310
No! No! Johnson! No! No!

19:35.430 --> 19:38.270
Rene, let go!
Let her go!

19:38.390 --> 19:40.750
Let her go.
Let go! Je t'aime!

19:40.870 --> 19:43.190
No, no, no.
Rene! Let her go.

19:43.270 --> 19:45.190
Say it! Je t'aime!

19:45.310 --> 19:48.790
Back away, now!
Hey! Stay away from him!

19:51.510 --> 19:53.950
What did I tell you?
He needs help.

19:54.070 --> 19:56.350
He needs a straitjacket.
He needs medical attention.

19:56.430 --> 19:57.950
He was injured in the war, Eddie.

19:58.070 --> 20:00.230
And the war made him kill
George Bligh, eh?

20:00.310 --> 20:01.390
Commie bastard.

20:01.470 --> 20:04.162
- Men like you should be ashamed.
- Get out.

20:04.162 --> 20:05.950
Forget it, Sarah.

20:06.070 --> 20:07.870
He wasn't there.
He wouldn't understand.

20:07.990 --> 20:09.990
What is that supposed to mean?
I'm not leaving him.

20:11.310 --> 20:12.590
You don't get a choice.

20:13.790 --> 20:15.230
Hey, hey. Alright?

20:15.350 --> 20:17.870
Alright.
Let's not make this any worse.

20:20.470 --> 20:21.470
Come on.

20:25.910 --> 20:27.550
Good afternoon. Mr Bligh's family?

20:27.670 --> 20:30.630
Oh, yes, I'm his mother,
Mrs Elizabeth Bligh.

20:30.750 --> 20:32.956
This is my daughter, Carolyn.
My grandson, James.

20:32.957 --> 20:34.310
And you are?

20:34.430 --> 20:37.630
Henry Fox, surgeon.
Your son is a very lucky man.

20:37.750 --> 20:39.990
The bullet missed the spleen
and liver.

20:40.150 --> 20:44.750
And I must admit, Sister Nordmann
was right to remove the bullet
before it caused more damage.

20:44.870 --> 20:47.030
Oh, that is good news.
Can we see him?

20:47.150 --> 20:49.870
I'm afraid he's not out of danger.
He's lost a lot of blood,

20:49.990 --> 20:52.350
and infection is still
a possibility.

20:52.430 --> 20:54.110
But he will recover?

20:54.190 --> 20:55.830
I'm confident he will, yes.

20:55.910 --> 20:57.550
Now I can telephone Anna.

20:59.670 --> 21:01.550
Excuse me.

21:01.670 --> 21:03.870
It's been a difficult day
for everyone.

21:03.990 --> 21:06.830
Yes, made no easier by the stunning
lack of professionalism

21:06.950 --> 21:09.830
displayed by your staff.
To keep us waiting without a word...

21:09.950 --> 21:11.910
Grandmother!
No!

21:11.990 --> 21:14.430
I'm afraid it's not good enough.

21:14.550 --> 21:16.470
My son will be transferred
to Arthur Cargill's care...

21:16.590 --> 21:19.110
I don't...
..forthwith. I said it's decided.

21:19.190 --> 21:21.110
You know Dr Cargill, I presume?

21:21.230 --> 21:23.310
Cargill, yes. He's a fine man.
Indeed.

21:23.430 --> 21:24.988
His equipment's not quite
up-to-date,

21:25.105 --> 21:27.746
and his registrars aren't on call
24 hours a day.

21:27.746 --> 21:29.388
But for the vapours,
or a nervous turn...

21:29.389 --> 21:30.590
Are you arguing with me?

21:30.750 --> 21:34.110
Mrs Bligh, it would be foolish to send your
son to a lesser-equipped hospital.

21:34.230 --> 21:37.790
Later, when all he requires is a
fluffy pillow, it might be sensible.

21:37.870 --> 21:39.230
If you'll excuse me.

21:42.030 --> 21:44.710
Of course, Grandmother's giving
the staff what for.

21:44.790 --> 21:46.390
I can imagine.

21:46.510 --> 21:49.270
But your father is alive.
That is all that matters.

21:50.950 --> 21:53.790
I suppose it's just a waiting game
now to see if he wakes up.

21:53.910 --> 21:57.070
Darling, I am sorry,
but I really must go.

21:57.150 --> 21:59.190
We'll talk again soon.

21:59.270 --> 22:01.310
Is everything alright?

22:01.430 --> 22:04.150
I'm interviewing
for the maid's position.

22:05.750 --> 22:07.230
Is now really the time?

22:07.350 --> 22:10.725
Your grandmother made
the arrangements before she left.

22:10.725 --> 22:13.950
And with the christening fast approaching
and so much still to be done...

22:14.070 --> 22:15.950
Perhaps we should delay
the christening

22:16.070 --> 22:19.790
until Father has recuperated.
As for hiring a new maid...

22:19.870 --> 22:21.550
Don't give it another thought.

22:21.630 --> 22:23.750
I'm sorry.

22:23.870 --> 22:27.790
I feel so utterly useless
down here by myself.

22:27.910 --> 22:30.310
I'm sorry, Livvy,
I don't mean to scold you.

22:30.390 --> 22:32.510
No, it's nothing.

22:32.590 --> 22:34.630
Be with your father.

22:34.710 --> 22:37.430
Telephone the minute he wakes up.

22:37.550 --> 22:40.230
Goodbye.
Bye, darling.

22:48.910 --> 22:50.590
How kind.

22:50.710 --> 22:53.110
A hearty brew puts everything right,
to be sure.

22:53.190 --> 22:54.710
Quite.

22:58.830 --> 23:01.270
Rose, isn't it?

23:01.390 --> 23:06.150
Yes, ma'am.
I'm afraid I have wasted your time.

23:07.790 --> 23:11.150
I'm sorry to tell you
the interviews must be postponed.

23:11.230 --> 23:14.670
Never mind. Family comes first.

23:17.110 --> 23:18.230
Rose?

23:21.270 --> 23:23.430
Could you stay a moment?

23:33.030 --> 23:36.470
Cigarette?
No, thank you.

23:36.590 --> 23:39.310
I should apologise
for my grandmother's behaviour.

23:39.390 --> 23:41.990
You saved my father's life.

23:42.070 --> 23:43.750
No apology necessary.

23:47.350 --> 23:48.790
How are you holding up?

23:50.790 --> 23:53.390
It's a long story,
but I don't much like hospitals.

23:55.110 --> 23:58.190
Truth be told,
I don't much like them, either.

24:00.390 --> 24:03.150
You must think me such a fool
for getting so emotional in there.

24:03.270 --> 24:06.470
I think you're rather human,
actually. It's just that...

24:06.550 --> 24:08.550
my father and I, we've...

24:08.630 --> 24:11.470
We've had a difficult time of it.

24:14.350 --> 24:16.110
You know, people will tell you
differently,

24:16.230 --> 24:20.790
but there's nothing you can do about
what's been, or what's yet to be.

24:20.870 --> 24:23.390
All we can affect is the present.

24:26.230 --> 24:29.550
My grandmother would tell you
differently.

24:29.630 --> 24:32.390
She lives for the past.

24:33.990 --> 24:36.630
And what she plans for the future.

24:36.750 --> 24:39.790
Yes, she's quite the lioness,
isn't she?

24:39.870 --> 24:41.830
Defending her patch of savannah.

24:45.790 --> 24:47.264
Are you sure you won't join me?

24:47.265 --> 24:50.510
Something awfully sad about
puffing away on one's own.

24:53.790 --> 24:55.230
Why not?

25:05.830 --> 25:07.270
I should get back.

25:24.029 --> 25:26.669
Mother, sit down.

25:29.470 --> 25:32.910
Did you speak to Anna?
No answer.

25:32.991 --> 25:34.631
Jack sends his best, though.

25:34.710 --> 25:37.230
Is he...

25:37.310 --> 25:39.510
Can I see him?

25:39.830 --> 25:41.190
It is family only.

25:42.310 --> 25:44.790
I am family.
Immediate family.

25:44.910 --> 25:47.790
Your presence is not required.
So don't let us keep you.

25:51.030 --> 25:52.990
I brought George's things.

25:53.110 --> 25:56.030
Personal effects,
his favourite books and photographs,

25:56.150 --> 25:58.070
to remind him
of all he has to live for.

26:09.870 --> 26:12.710
I got the tickets.

26:12.790 --> 26:15.550
'A Streetcar Named Desire'.

26:15.670 --> 26:17.987
Front row balcony,
just like you wanted.

26:18.578 --> 26:19.990
Thank you.

26:22.710 --> 26:25.310
Would you mind awfully
if we didn't go? I...

26:25.390 --> 26:28.430
I just don't feel up to it.

26:28.510 --> 26:31.350
Sorry to be a spoil-sport.

26:32.190 --> 26:35.750
You read Swanson's letter.
Please don't be angry with me, Gino.

26:35.830 --> 26:37.910
I'm not, not with you.

26:37.990 --> 26:39.470
But, Anna, we promised.

26:39.550 --> 26:41.390
But the things he wrote.

26:41.790 --> 26:43.990
Like what?

26:44.070 --> 26:45.630
Like what, Anna?

26:45.710 --> 26:48.190
He said that...

26:48.310 --> 26:50.750
that little Georgie
isn't James's son.

26:50.910 --> 26:54.310
That Olivia bought another baby
after losing the one that she carried.

26:54.390 --> 26:56.270
You can't believe him.

26:56.350 --> 26:59.150
He's a liar, a cazzo.

26:59.310 --> 27:03.390
He wants to make pain for your
family, to punish you for marrying me.

27:03.510 --> 27:07.230
There's more to it than that, Gino.
But I can't tell you.

27:07.310 --> 27:09.030
Anna.

27:09.110 --> 27:11.190
You're playing into his hands.

27:11.310 --> 27:14.830
To worry, or wonder,
that's what he wants.

27:14.850 --> 27:17.190
You can't let Andrew do this to us.
Even if it's true, and it's not,

27:17.270 --> 27:18.750
it's not our place.

27:18.870 --> 27:22.190
Gino...
He's toying with you, bella.

27:22.270 --> 27:23.750
Do you really think so?

27:23.830 --> 27:25.790
Yes, Anna, I do.

27:25.870 --> 27:27.830
Forget about it.

27:30.710 --> 27:32.310
Did someone come to your aid?

27:32.430 --> 27:35.390
Oh, it was me own fault...
My own fault.

27:35.510 --> 27:39.070
I was a proper dill, leaving my bag
on the seat like that.

27:39.150 --> 27:40.710
Oh, it's so odd.

27:40.830 --> 27:43.750
The Inverness train
seems so perfectly safe.

27:43.870 --> 27:46.990
Perhaps in first class.
Of course.

27:50.270 --> 27:53.070
Now, I've ought in the way
of references for the position.

27:53.190 --> 27:56.030
Did the station master
think they'd find the culprit?

27:56.110 --> 27:58.910
He said he'd try, but...

27:58.990 --> 28:00.670
And your previous mistress,

28:00.790 --> 28:03.830
you say she's on a grand tour
of Europe?

28:03.990 --> 28:07.190
The whole family.
That's the reason you've no position?

28:07.270 --> 28:09.790
It's all explained in the reference.

28:09.910 --> 28:12.630
Mrs Celia was ever so nice
with what she said.

28:12.830 --> 28:14.870
I see.

28:23.630 --> 28:25.710
Hi. Excuse me.

28:27.350 --> 28:29.990
What's all this about?
Is it all that bad?

28:30.110 --> 28:32.990
Is it really?
I beg your pardon!

28:33.070 --> 28:36.270
Oh, ma'am, I'm ever so sorry.

28:36.390 --> 28:41.750
Oh, shh. What's all this about?
What is all this about?

28:41.870 --> 28:45.350
Is it ever so bad?
Is it ever so bad?

28:47.830 --> 28:50.350
How did you do that?

28:51.950 --> 28:55.310
When you've got as many brother
and sisters as me... As I have...

28:55.390 --> 28:58.430
You're such a sweet little thing.

28:58.550 --> 29:04.470
Well, you do have a way with him.
I'm not sure I have.

29:04.870 --> 29:07.870
There's nothing more natural
than a mother's love.

29:17.870 --> 29:20.510
I can get a new reference,
but it may take a while.

29:22.150 --> 29:26.310
Perhaps a trial period, then,
until it arrives.

29:26.590 --> 29:29.590
Truly?
When might you start?

29:29.710 --> 29:33.150
Tomorrow?
Perfect.

29:33.270 --> 29:36.910
I think this one needs attention.

29:37.030 --> 29:39.790
I could do that.
Oh, no, I'm perfectly alright.

29:45.550 --> 29:48.230
Mr Bligh has responded well
to the transfusions.

29:48.350 --> 29:50.673
His blood pressure has improved.
There's no sign of further bleeding.

29:50.673 --> 29:52.190
And infection?

29:52.310 --> 29:56.110
And his stable temperature indicates
no sign of infection.

29:56.190 --> 29:57.990
He's not out of the woods,

29:58.110 --> 30:01.110
but stable enough for a visitor.
Splendid.

30:01.190 --> 30:04.230
Mr Bligh?

30:04.310 --> 30:05.950
Oh.

30:08.830 --> 30:10.510
You're sure?
As it should be.

30:15.750 --> 30:20.110
Imagine, a doctor playing such
petty games at a time like this.

30:31.550 --> 30:33.190
Can I talk to him?

30:33.350 --> 30:37.190
Well, he's up to the gills on
morphine but there's no harm in trying.

31:00.750 --> 31:03.510
We're all here for you, Father.

31:04.350 --> 31:06.790
Praying for you.

31:07.630 --> 31:12.790
We'll get through this.

31:13.990 --> 31:17.430
"Blow the doors off their hinges.
Let the world into Ash Park."

31:17.510 --> 31:19.070
Just like you said.

31:21.070 --> 31:23.350
We'll do it for little Georgie.

31:31.710 --> 31:34.310
It won't be about the past.

31:37.350 --> 31:42.710
Just the present.

31:52.430 --> 31:53.870
He can hear me.

31:59.150 --> 32:02.310
I said I'm fine.

32:02.430 --> 32:05.590
Honestly?
It's Rene we need to worry about.

32:05.670 --> 32:07.150
You don't look fine.

32:07.230 --> 32:08.670
Enough.

32:13.030 --> 32:15.990
I know you don't want to face the fact,
but Rene could have hurt you.

32:16.110 --> 32:19.150
He was upset.
You know I'm right.

32:21.510 --> 32:25.230
Such a betrayal to admit
being afraid of my own husband.

32:25.350 --> 32:26.830
We have to get him out
of that place.

32:26.990 --> 32:30.630
It's that place. Right now
I'm taking you home to Roy's.

32:30.710 --> 32:33.150
No, I need to be with Rene.

32:33.270 --> 32:35.390
I should never have left him.
Tomorrow.

32:35.470 --> 32:38.550
You need rest.

32:38.630 --> 32:41.670
Doctor's orders. March.

32:45.190 --> 32:49.510
I mean to say, if Dr Nordmann
is a genuine threat to the
safety of the community,

32:49.670 --> 32:54.590
then we ought to know about it,
regardless of the esteem
in which his wife may be held.

32:54.710 --> 32:57.630
Don't you agree?
No, I do not.

32:59.470 --> 33:03.750
All this Reds-under-the-bed
nonsense sounds like a lynch mob.

33:03.870 --> 33:08.590
Surely, one has a right,
in fact, a duty to question...

33:08.710 --> 33:11.990
All we know
is that George Bligh almost died,

33:12.150 --> 33:17.550
and a lot of other people are hurting
because some tortured soul
got hold of an unattended weapon.

33:19.390 --> 33:22.550
Surely you don't hold yourself
responsible?

33:22.670 --> 33:26.070
Well, it was my gun that did the
shooting, no two ways about that.

33:26.710 --> 33:28.630
That's preposterous!

33:28.750 --> 33:31.270
How could you have possibly
foreseen this?

33:31.350 --> 33:33.190
You couldn't have.

33:33.310 --> 33:36.710
Well, you're wrong.
You're quite wrong.

33:36.790 --> 33:38.670
Oh.

33:38.750 --> 33:40.750
Why not?

33:40.830 --> 33:42.950
Bottoms up.

33:43.030 --> 33:44.710
Cheers.

34:02.710 --> 34:04.390
Mrs Nordmann.

34:04.470 --> 34:07.030
Cuppa?

34:07.110 --> 34:08.949
Just bed, I think.

34:24.350 --> 34:26.670
I won't have it, George. I won't.

34:26.790 --> 34:31.550
You will wake up.
We will be together.

34:35.989 --> 34:37.909
I love you, George.

34:38.230 --> 34:40.030
Always have.

34:40.150 --> 34:44.429
You've just never seen it.
Never trusted it.

34:45.630 --> 34:49.389
I'm going to show you.
Without you, I'm...

34:50.030 --> 34:54.030
You are so utterly wilful!
Come away from him.

34:54.110 --> 34:55.510
I had to see him.

34:55.590 --> 34:58.430
Get out. Now!

34:59.630 --> 35:00.750
He will want to see me.

35:00.830 --> 35:02.230
Leave.

35:02.390 --> 35:05.350
I'll leave but I'm not... Now!
..going anywhere!

35:06.830 --> 35:10.390
Don't tell me a heart does beat
inside that cadaverous chest.

35:12.030 --> 35:14.270
Mother? Mother!

35:14.350 --> 35:16.550
Help, someone!

35:16.630 --> 35:18.830
Please help! Mother!

35:19.630 --> 35:21.070
Mrs Bligh, what's happening?

35:21.150 --> 35:22.990
I...can't... breathe.

35:26.430 --> 35:28.190
It was a dizzy turn, nothing more.

35:28.270 --> 35:29.710
It was a lot more.

35:29.790 --> 35:31.670
Excuse me.

35:34.110 --> 35:36.790
And by the sound of things,
hardly a new condition.

35:36.910 --> 35:41.990
I am in perfect health.
She was hospitalised not long ago.

35:42.150 --> 35:44.270
Then you've no doubt heard
what I'm about to tell you. She has.

35:44.430 --> 35:47.790
I have. Bed rest, at home,
for at least a week.

35:47.910 --> 35:49.906
Out of the question.
My son needs me here.

35:49.907 --> 35:52.510
You'll be no good to George
if you're ill.

35:52.630 --> 35:55.950
Grandmother, if you have another
heart attack, you could die.

35:56.070 --> 35:59.310
I find it best not to terrify
my patients wherever possible.

35:59.390 --> 36:01.350
Your patients aren't my grandmother.

36:01.510 --> 36:04.510
True. I do hope you're enjoying
yourselves.

36:04.590 --> 36:06.110
Mrs Bligh, you need rest.

36:06.115 --> 36:08.150
If you won't rest at home,
I'll have to admit you.

36:08.270 --> 36:10.390
No.
Grandmother!

36:10.510 --> 36:12.710
I'm sure cardiology has a private
room on the fourth floor.

36:12.830 --> 36:14.734
I'll have the nurses bring
the paperwork.

36:14.734 --> 36:16.910
Very well.

36:17.030 --> 36:20.950
But I insist you inform me if there
is any change in George's condition.

36:21.070 --> 36:23.350
I shall leave
the strictest instructions.

36:27.510 --> 36:30.390
Well, he's rather smashing,
don't you think?

36:30.510 --> 36:33.950
That's what comes of handing out
scholarships willy-nilly.

36:34.030 --> 36:36.910
Hey, Anna! Anna!

36:37.070 --> 36:39.190
You quiet that howling down
and get to bed.

36:39.310 --> 36:42.190
You're gonna get the law on you!
Anna!

36:42.270 --> 36:44.150
Shh!

36:44.270 --> 36:47.990
Can you imagine having a marriage
like Stella and Stanley's?

36:48.110 --> 36:51.230
Well, happily, I don't have to.
Mm, and poor Blanche.

36:51.390 --> 36:54.110
I do hope I never have to depend
on the kindness of strangers.

36:54.270 --> 36:58.950
You won't have to.
I'm gonna be the best husband. Oh!

36:59.030 --> 37:01.670
Mr Poletti!

37:04.590 --> 37:08.790
Shh. We have to...

37:16.550 --> 37:18.190
Gino!

37:18.270 --> 37:21.310
Is my Italian that bad?

37:21.390 --> 37:23.910
Could you not under...

37:24.030 --> 37:26.910
Mama and Papa have had news
of my brother.

37:26.990 --> 37:30.150
Oh, that's wonderful, isn't it?

37:32.455 --> 37:34.190
Mama and Papa want to leave
right away.

37:34.270 --> 37:36.150
We need to look after the farm.

37:36.230 --> 37:38.190
Of course.

37:40.950 --> 37:43.590
They want to go tomorrow.
I can start packing.

37:43.710 --> 37:45.710
We'll leave first thing
in the morning.

37:45.790 --> 37:48.030
We can take them to the station.

37:48.150 --> 37:50.230
You're not upset?
About the honeymoon?

37:50.350 --> 37:53.550
Oh, Gino, we have the rest
of our lives together.

37:53.630 --> 37:56.350
And the farm to ourselves.

37:59.950 --> 38:00.950
The other business...

38:01.070 --> 38:03.459
with the letter. That's not why
you're happy to go home?

38:04.870 --> 38:07.950
Anna?
I can't pretend that I don't know.

38:08.070 --> 38:11.510
I feel... I feel
that I have to do something.

38:11.590 --> 38:13.190
Olivia was pregnant,

38:13.310 --> 38:15.950
and she had the baby.
Swanson, pazzo, is lying.

38:16.070 --> 38:18.230
But it could be true, Gino.
How?

38:18.350 --> 38:21.350
It makes sense that Olivia
would be that desperate for a baby

38:21.470 --> 38:24.590
if... Perhaps there wasn't
to be another.

38:26.130 --> 38:28.005
Why wouldn't there be?
Can James not make one?

38:28.006 --> 38:29.950
If he didn't want to?

38:30.030 --> 38:31.910
What man doesn't want to?

38:34.070 --> 38:36.350
You can't tell anyone.

38:37.950 --> 38:40.190
I will not say anything.

38:43.750 --> 38:46.830
James is...

38:48.830 --> 38:49.950
He's what?

38:51.550 --> 38:53.030
He's different.

38:53.110 --> 38:55.230
What are you saying?

38:55.310 --> 38:58.830
That James is a...

38:58.910 --> 39:01.390
a homosexual.

39:04.270 --> 39:07.430
No. He can't be.

39:09.630 --> 39:12.390
James?

39:16.150 --> 39:18.070
That's disgusting.
Gino.

39:19.790 --> 39:21.310
That's disgusting.

39:24.910 --> 39:28.450
Of course, Andrew plans to attend
all the best parties in London.

39:28.545 --> 39:29.985
And then there's the polo,

39:30.065 --> 39:33.665
and the fox hunting.

39:33.785 --> 39:37.505
Oh, perhaps even an invitation
to Checkers.

39:37.625 --> 39:42.585
Oh, doesn't it make you want
to be their age again?

39:42.665 --> 39:44.345
Your whole life ahead.

39:48.665 --> 39:50.625
Oh, Elizabeth.

39:50.745 --> 39:55.065
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, how thoughtless of me.

39:55.185 --> 39:58.505
Carrying on about my son,
when yours lies in a hospital bed.

39:58.625 --> 40:03.985
Oh, what a fine pair, eh? All misty
eyes and runny noses.

40:04.265 --> 40:06.665
Tea, I think.

40:06.745 --> 40:08.585
Or whisky.

40:10.785 --> 40:13.065
Quite right.

40:13.145 --> 40:16.065
Doubles.

40:16.145 --> 40:18.385
Diana!

40:27.785 --> 40:29.265
Sarah.

41:31.305 --> 41:34.065
Mama and Papa will be anxious
to see you before they leave.

41:34.185 --> 41:36.785
I'll ride over as soon
as I've spoken with him.

41:36.905 --> 41:39.505
You understand
why I have to do this?

41:39.585 --> 41:42.465
True or not, James should know.

41:45.065 --> 41:46.665
It's none of my business.

41:47.905 --> 41:50.705
Whatever James is, he's my brother.

41:54.465 --> 41:55.825
Hello, Mrs Poletti.

41:55.905 --> 41:58.225
Hello, Colleen. Is Mr James home?

41:58.345 --> 42:01.945
No, but you'll find Miss Olivia
and Georgie on the lawn.

42:02.025 --> 42:03.345
Oh, thank you.

42:06.865 --> 42:09.665
Hello, stranger!

42:09.785 --> 42:14.265
We thought we'd break with tradition
and breakfast in the sunshine.

42:15.465 --> 42:17.265
Grandmother would never approve.

42:17.385 --> 42:21.385
Possibly not.
But we needed cheering up.

42:21.505 --> 42:26.745
About what?
Did somebody say something?

42:27.225 --> 42:29.665
No, I meant because of your father.

42:32.225 --> 42:34.305
You do know he's in hospital.

42:34.745 --> 42:37.345
Is he alright?
Why... Why didn't anyone tell me?

42:37.465 --> 42:39.705
Oh, Carolyn said
she would telephone.

42:39.825 --> 42:42.185
We didn't want to ruin
your honeymoon.

42:42.265 --> 42:43.745
I have to go to the hospital!

42:43.825 --> 42:46.065
No, Anna, wait. He's in Sydney.

42:48.985 --> 42:50.145
He was shot.

42:56.465 --> 42:59.345
That bouquet can go, Carolyn.
It's laughably ostentatious.

42:59.465 --> 43:01.825
It will not.
They're George's favourites.

43:01.945 --> 43:03.585
Wrong side of funereal,
if you ask me.

43:04.053 --> 43:05.619
Well, then,
it's a good thing nobody is.

43:05.620 --> 43:07.785
Must you...
Father.

43:07.905 --> 43:10.385
..make such an awful racket?
George. George.

43:10.705 --> 43:12.225
About time.

43:14.225 --> 43:17.225
Oh, you're all here.

43:17.305 --> 43:19.385
Yes, we are.

43:19.465 --> 43:21.305
Where is 'here' exactly?

43:22.585 --> 43:25.665
Um, there was an accident.

43:27.705 --> 43:31.625
Rene.
You remember what happened?

43:34.385 --> 43:37.105
There was...

43:37.225 --> 43:42.065
There was a struggle.
I... I don't remember anything.

43:43.785 --> 43:46.265
You're going to make
a full recovery.

43:46.345 --> 43:48.105
That's all that matters.

43:56.385 --> 43:58.105
I'd like to place a telephone call.

43:58.185 --> 44:00.185
It's for hospital use only.

44:05.585 --> 44:07.105
But I'm sure in this case...

44:10.425 --> 44:11.625
That will be all.

44:21.745 --> 44:23.545
Mon amour!

44:23.625 --> 44:26.185
What did you do to him?

44:27.945 --> 44:30.305
He wouldn't stop banging his head.
What did you do?

44:30.385 --> 44:32.185
Nothing! The man's a fruitcake!

44:34.025 --> 44:37.105
We have to do something.
Open the cell.

44:37.225 --> 44:40.105
I need to assess this man's wounds.

44:40.185 --> 44:41.625
Oh, I have to...

44:41.705 --> 44:42.985
Sarah, what's going on?

44:43.105 --> 44:45.345
I should...
Sit, sit. I'll bring some water.

44:45.425 --> 44:47.185
No. No.

44:50.465 --> 44:53.025
Sarge. Telephone.

45:30.065 --> 45:32.225
I telephoned
as soon as I remembered,

45:32.345 --> 45:34.425
to prevent
any miscarriage of justice.

45:34.545 --> 45:38.345
I must have been blocking it out
because of the shock.

45:38.465 --> 45:41.265
That poor man wasn't trying
to kill George.

45:41.345 --> 45:43.945
He was about to take his own life.

45:44.865 --> 45:46.865
I know, who would consider
such a thing?

45:48.905 --> 45:50.065
And Mr Bligh was shot...

45:50.185 --> 45:52.545
Trying to wrestle the gun
from the madman.

45:52.665 --> 45:57.225
George is the hero of the piece.
It's so clear to me now.

45:58.345 --> 46:00.065
You realise Nordmann will go free?

46:00.185 --> 46:03.185
I do hope
no-one holds it against him.

46:06.865 --> 46:09.585
You know, you never said
how you ended up with the rifle.

46:11.625 --> 46:14.065
I suppose it was dropped
after it went off.

46:14.145 --> 46:15.785
You suppose?

46:15.905 --> 46:18.665
Are you questioning my word,
Sergeant?

46:18.745 --> 46:20.665
That really wouldn't do.

46:22.865 --> 46:24.405
Thank you for coming by.

46:46.486 --> 46:49.246
Darling, what splendid news.

46:49.326 --> 46:52.166
Well, give your father my love.

46:52.246 --> 46:54.446
Thank you for letting me know.

47:25.406 --> 47:29.646
Oh! Oh, Father! I was so worried!

47:29.726 --> 47:31.286
Look at you!

47:31.406 --> 47:33.486
What a pickle!

47:37.706 --> 47:38.766
Need some help?

47:38.846 --> 47:40.406
It's done.

47:42.486 --> 47:43.766
Isn't it?

48:01.646 --> 48:03.086
Sarah?

48:17.766 --> 48:20.286
Sarah? Jack.

48:28.566 --> 48:30.886
Nausea, vomiting, fatigue?

48:32.166 --> 48:34.526
It's the last few days -
everything that's happened.

48:35.846 --> 48:37.046
Sarah.

48:39.937 --> 48:41.446
I'm pregnant.
