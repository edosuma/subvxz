WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:01.967
Sergeant baker, please.

00:01.969 --> 00:03.068
He's gone for the day,
mr. Spry.

00:03.203 --> 00:04.102
I can take a message.

00:04.138 --> 00:05.303
I don't want to
leave a message.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.905
Look, I need to
see him, please.

00:06.974 --> 00:08.040
<i> Mr. Spry, I can't help you.</i>

00:08.175 --> 00:09.474
I'm sorry.

00:09.543 --> 00:10.776
I need to see him.
-<i> I can't do anything.</i>

00:10.911 --> 00:12.311
I've had
multiple interviews.

00:12.446 --> 00:14.379
Two detectives.
No one has followed up.

00:20.187 --> 00:21.520
<i> Sergeant baker!</i>

00:21.522 --> 00:22.854
<i> Sergeant baker.</i>

00:22.890 --> 00:24.322
Sergeant baker!

00:26.260 --> 00:31.196
(tense music)

00:31.198 --> 00:32.697
Sergeant baker,
I'm talking to you!

00:32.767 --> 00:34.867
Officer:
<i> Sir, step away</i>
<i> from the glass.</i>

00:34.869 --> 00:37.202
(tense music)

00:37.204 --> 00:38.403
Officer 2:
<i> Buddy, calm down.</i>

00:38.406 --> 00:40.038
Go to hell.

00:40.107 --> 00:41.606
Get over here.

00:41.642 --> 00:42.908
<i> Spread your feet.</i>

00:42.910 --> 00:43.942
Christian:
<i> Get your hands</i>
<i> off of me.</i>

00:44.078 --> 00:45.077
Officer:
<i> Give me your hand.</i>

00:45.212 --> 00:47.012
Christian:
<i> Please, get your</i>
<i> hands off of me.</i>

00:49.817 --> 00:51.416
Please.
-<i> Come here.</i>

00:53.821 --> 00:55.153
Joyce:
<i> Shall we begin?</i>

00:56.557 --> 00:57.689
Madame adjudicator,

00:57.691 --> 01:01.159
The relationship between
the lgbtq+ community

01:01.195 --> 01:02.828
And the
halifax police department

01:02.897 --> 01:04.963
Has always been strained.

01:05.099 --> 01:09.968
One glance at the history
shows a pattern of antipathy,

01:10.604 --> 01:11.503
Neglect,

01:11.638 --> 01:17.442
And at times,
outright hostility.

01:17.445 --> 01:19.377
And this pattern
is evident

01:19.447 --> 01:22.046
In the handling of my
client's sexual assault,

01:22.083 --> 01:25.150
From the delayed processing of
his sexual assault evidence kit

01:25.285 --> 01:27.285
<i> To the lack of</i>
<i> follow-up on leads.</i>

01:28.822 --> 01:30.022
<i> Christian spry</i>

01:30.157 --> 01:32.858
<i> Reveals just how</i>
<i> the justice system</i>

01:32.927 --> 01:34.726
<i> Fails queer people.</i>

01:35.663 --> 01:37.462
<i> Sexual assault is a-</i>

01:38.999 --> 01:43.735
It's a horrible and
traumatizing experience.

01:45.606 --> 01:51.809
And christian spry's
trauma was just dismissed

01:51.846 --> 01:55.080
By the very people we
trust to serve and protect

01:55.215 --> 01:57.349
Because of their prejudice.

01:57.418 --> 02:00.819
<i> That makes my client</i>
<i> a victim of assault</i>

02:00.954 --> 02:02.354
And a flawed system.

02:02.423 --> 02:05.357
And that just
isn't justice.

02:07.261 --> 02:08.527
Thank you, counsel.

02:09.396 --> 02:10.762
Ms. Chen?

02:10.764 --> 02:12.097
It's true.

02:12.099 --> 02:15.033
Justice wasn't
served in mr. Spry's
assault case.

02:15.102 --> 02:16.502
No assailant
was located.

02:16.637 --> 02:19.438
And what is alleged
to have happened to
the complainant

02:19.440 --> 02:23.175
In the early hours
of may 28th is
undeniably horrible.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.879
But, uh,
let's be clear,

02:27.014 --> 02:28.112
<i> The halifax</i>
<i> police department</i>

02:28.149 --> 02:30.048
<i> Have acknowledged</i>
<i> their historical bias</i>

02:30.050 --> 02:31.783
<i> Towards the</i>
<i> lgbtq+ community.</i>

02:31.819 --> 02:33.719
<i> They declined uniformed</i>
<i> participation in pride.</i>

02:35.189 --> 02:37.021
They hired an equity
and diversity officer

02:37.057 --> 02:40.325
<i> To build relationships with</i>
<i> neighbourhood organizations.</i>

02:40.394 --> 02:43.595
<i> Identity is not</i>
<i> the issue here.</i>

02:44.965 --> 02:47.332
<i> The sad reality is not every</i>
<i> case can find resolution.</i>

02:48.369 --> 02:49.801
<i> It's understandably</i>
<i> frustrating,</i>

02:49.837 --> 02:51.603
<i> But it isn't evidence</i>
<i> of homophobia.</i>

02:51.738 --> 02:53.839
<i> Suggesting that</i>
<i> constable fitzpatrick</i>

02:53.841 --> 02:57.676
<i> Or sergeant baker's behaviour</i>
<i> reflects their personal bias</i>

02:57.678 --> 03:00.011
Ignores the more than
40 years of service

03:00.047 --> 03:01.413
Between these two men.

03:01.548 --> 03:03.215
<i> But maligning</i>
<i> their character?</i>

03:03.217 --> 03:04.349
<i> That won't</i>
<i> provide mr. Spry</i>

03:04.351 --> 03:06.218
<i> With the justice he's</i>
<i> so desperately seeking.</i>

03:09.657 --> 03:10.989
(knocking on door)

03:13.160 --> 03:14.693
Marea!

03:14.695 --> 03:15.827
You didn't tell me
you were coming.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.129
<i> When did you get in?</i>

03:17.264 --> 03:18.496
Last night.

03:18.566 --> 03:20.632
<i> Is there any chance</i>
<i> we can have lunch?</i>

03:20.701 --> 03:21.833
I have court.

03:21.835 --> 03:22.935
What about dinner?

03:23.070 --> 03:25.070
That's the only
time I can see mom.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.939
Well perfect, you
can see us both.

03:27.074 --> 03:28.840
Is mom gonna be
cool with that?

03:29.677 --> 03:30.842
Yeah, she'll be fine.

03:30.844 --> 03:31.876
I'll call her.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.278
Honey, I'm sorry.
I have to go to the office.

03:33.413 --> 03:35.246
But come to dinner tonight.
It'll be fine.

03:35.282 --> 03:36.782
I promise.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.249
Text me.
-<i> Okay.</i>

03:40.854 --> 03:42.587
New haircut?

03:42.590 --> 03:44.255
Same cut,
new product.

03:44.291 --> 03:45.724
It's that grape
seed oil stuff

03:45.726 --> 03:47.525
That dani
keeps pushing
at the salon.

03:48.395 --> 03:49.727
You look terrible.

03:51.065 --> 03:53.331
Wow, I agree
to meet you
for coffee

03:53.400 --> 03:54.733
And this is
what I get?

03:54.735 --> 03:56.268
I'm worried
about you.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.403
Ever since you teamed
up with marcie diggs

03:58.405 --> 04:00.005
And her
anti-police outfit-

04:00.007 --> 04:01.706
Anti-police?

04:01.742 --> 04:03.375
Mom, you have it so wrong.

04:03.510 --> 04:05.277
<i> This christian spry business,</i>

04:05.412 --> 04:07.712
Trying to make us all out
like we're homophobes.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.481
It's one discrimination case.

04:09.550 --> 04:11.182
I take offence to it.

04:19.393 --> 04:21.026
I need to ask
you a question.

04:21.161 --> 04:22.527
Go ahead.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.229
I need to know
about gary baker.

04:25.266 --> 04:27.165
You really gonna
do her dirty work?

04:27.234 --> 04:28.333
Ellery:
<i> We both know</i>

04:28.468 --> 04:31.369
That only complaints
that go to a hearing
get published.

04:31.405 --> 04:33.638
I just need to know
if he's decent.

04:33.641 --> 04:35.873
He walks a line,
no question.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.910
<i> But I've never heard</i>
<i> of him crossing it.</i>

04:40.647 --> 04:42.313
(soft jazz music)

04:42.349 --> 04:46.718
<i> ♪ but you still try</i>
<i> and call my phone</i>

04:46.787 --> 04:51.690
♪ tell me how does
it feel to be left
in the smoke

04:52.793 --> 04:58.696
<i> ♪ goodbye baby,</i>
<i> goodbye baby ♪</i>

05:00.634 --> 05:07.539

05:21.888 --> 05:24.956

05:27.294 --> 05:28.760
Avery:
<i> I-I knew you</i>
<i> were good.</i>

05:28.829 --> 05:30.628
But you were really good.

05:31.998 --> 05:35.367
I did not ask you
to come down here
to turn my head.

05:35.502 --> 05:36.902
I'm just speaking facts.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.706
Ah, marcie mentioned

05:40.841 --> 05:42.974
You wanted me to
help your minister
with something?

05:43.043 --> 05:44.209
Not the minister,

05:44.211 --> 05:45.577
One of the
parishioners.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.046
Fulton parker,

05:48.048 --> 05:49.314
You remember him?

05:50.150 --> 05:52.316
Yeah, yeah,
I know the case.

05:52.353 --> 05:55.787
It was a black teen jailed
for killing a white boy,

05:55.789 --> 05:57.589
Claims he didn't do it,
says he was framed.

05:57.658 --> 05:58.957
That's right.

05:58.959 --> 06:01.393
His poor mother
died two years ago.

06:01.462 --> 06:04.595
Never got over seeing her
son in that situation.

06:04.631 --> 06:07.132
So, how can I help?

06:07.134 --> 06:08.466
Fulton's got a son.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.536
Grown boy, eighteen.

06:12.873 --> 06:17.075
Promised his grandma he'd
prove his father's innocence,

06:17.144 --> 06:18.610
But he's just a
college student, avery.

06:18.745 --> 06:20.111
<i> He's not</i>
<i> equipped for this.</i>

06:20.848 --> 06:22.547
Look, I-

06:22.549 --> 06:25.883
I feel like this is more up
marcie's alley, mrs. Diggs.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.285
You're the prosecutor,
ain't ya?

06:28.622 --> 06:31.656
Who knows better how to
fight the law than a law man?

06:35.529 --> 06:38.963
Marcie:
<i> Mr. Spry, could you describe</i>
<i> the events leading up to</i>

06:39.032 --> 06:42.700
<i> And following your</i>
<i> assault on may 28th, 2020?</i>

06:44.705 --> 06:46.104
I'd had a bit of a day,

06:47.307 --> 06:49.507
So I called a friend
to blow off some steam.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.375
Ah, we went to
dinner at the oyster,

06:51.412 --> 06:53.912
And then went to a couple
bars in the north end.

06:53.914 --> 06:57.114
Marcie:
<i> And this friend</i>
<i> was xavier tennant?</i>

06:58.185 --> 06:59.317
<i> When was this?</i>

06:59.453 --> 07:01.052
Um, dinner was at six,

07:01.054 --> 07:04.122
<i> So we got to gottingen</i>
<i> around eight,</i>

07:04.257 --> 07:05.457
Started at parkside

07:05.526 --> 07:07.793
And then xavier suggested
we go to the barracks.

07:07.928 --> 07:12.730
Marcie:
<i> And could you describe</i>
<i> your level of intoxication</i>

07:12.766 --> 07:14.466
At this point,
mr. Spry?

07:14.535 --> 07:15.534
I was buzzed,

07:15.536 --> 07:17.536
But I knew to
pace myself.

07:17.538 --> 07:20.338
I'd only had maybe
five or six pints

07:20.474 --> 07:22.673
<i> In the course</i>
<i> of six hours.</i>

07:22.709 --> 07:24.209
Marcie:
<i> And then what</i>
<i> happened next?</i>

07:24.344 --> 07:26.478
Christian:
<i> I remember looking</i>
<i> at my phone.</i>

07:26.547 --> 07:28.747
It was about 12:30,

07:28.749 --> 07:32.550
And the crowd was
more intense.

07:32.619 --> 07:35.253
I figured I'd have one more
drink and then head home.

07:36.423 --> 07:41.092
That's the, the last thing
I remember before I,

07:43.296 --> 07:45.229
<i> I woke up face down.</i>

07:47.501 --> 07:50.134
<i> My pants were</i>
<i> around my ankles.</i>

07:50.170 --> 07:52.103
(christian groans)

07:52.105 --> 07:56.708
(christian shivers)
(dreamy sombre music)

07:56.843 --> 07:58.310
Christian:
<i> I didn't know</i>
<i> where I was,</i>

08:00.580 --> 08:01.613
<i> But as I got my bearings,</i>

08:01.615 --> 08:05.583
<i> I realized I was</i>
<i> at a train yard,</i>

08:05.652 --> 08:07.084
Very near the barracks.

08:09.923 --> 08:12.591
<i> I was feeling horrible.</i>

08:12.593 --> 08:15.327
<i> I didn't have my</i>
<i> phone or my things.</i>

08:21.602 --> 08:22.934
I wasn't good.

08:24.304 --> 08:27.072
Mr. Spry, if this is too
much for you, we can-

08:27.207 --> 08:28.273
We can stop.

08:28.275 --> 08:29.440
Christian:
<i> No.</i>

08:31.645 --> 08:34.546
<i> I got home,</i>
<i> I went to work,</i>

08:34.615 --> 08:37.215
Um, but I had to excuse
myself halfway through.

08:37.350 --> 08:41.953
I was nauseous
and-and disoriented.

08:41.989 --> 08:43.288
I kept getting these...

08:45.759 --> 08:46.958
Flashes.

08:47.895 --> 08:51.495
I-I knew I'd
been assaulted.

08:53.734 --> 08:56.467
I went to the hospital and
a nurse administered a-

08:57.971 --> 08:59.303
A rape kit.

09:00.807 --> 09:04.142
Marcie:
<i> Can you describe constable</i>
<i> fitzpatrick's demeanour?</i>

09:04.144 --> 09:05.576
Distracted.

09:06.846 --> 09:09.647
Disinterested when he
found out I was a man.

09:09.783 --> 09:12.584
And he conducted
the interview?

09:12.719 --> 09:14.719
Christian:
<i> He asked for permission</i>
<i> to access the kit,</i>

09:14.854 --> 09:19.791
<i> And, um, said someone</i>
<i> would be in touch.</i>

09:19.926 --> 09:24.262
I waited two weeks and then
went to the precinct myself.

09:24.331 --> 09:25.663
What happened then?

09:25.699 --> 09:27.932
Christian:
<i> I connected with</i>
<i> constable shadd.</i>

09:28.001 --> 09:30.468
<i> She was unfamiliar</i>
<i> with my case.</i>

09:30.537 --> 09:34.339
<i> She conducted a short</i>
<i> interview and said she'd call.</i>

09:36.610 --> 09:37.975
Did she?

09:38.345 --> 09:39.411
No.

09:40.814 --> 09:42.546
Christian:
<i> Four weeks later I</i>
<i> learned that my case</i>

09:42.583 --> 09:44.348
<i> Had been transferred</i>
<i> to sergeant baker.</i>

09:44.384 --> 09:48.019
Marcie:
<i> And what was your experience</i>
<i> like with sergeant baker?</i>

09:50.390 --> 09:52.290
Sergeant baker asked
if I was cruising,

09:53.560 --> 09:55.961
If I'd been doing
any illegal drugs.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.829
<i> He wanted to know how often</i>
<i> I went to the barracks,</i>

09:57.898 --> 09:58.929
Why I was there,

09:58.966 --> 10:01.099
If I'd picked up
there before.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.234
So, did he follow-up?

10:04.971 --> 10:06.203
No.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.039
<i> Three months went by.</i>

10:09.943 --> 10:11.376
Nothing happened.

10:11.511 --> 10:16.181
Marcie:
<i> Three months without any</i>
<i> progress on the investigation?</i>

10:16.316 --> 10:18.516
No follow-up
with eyewitnesses

10:18.652 --> 10:22.387
<i> Or no visit to the crime</i>
<i> scene that you're aware of?</i>

10:23.823 --> 10:25.056
That's correct.

10:25.993 --> 10:26.957
Marcie:
<i> Thank you, mr. Spry.</i>

10:30.797 --> 10:31.863
In sergeant baker's notes,

10:31.998 --> 10:34.199
You mentioned having an
argument with your husband

10:34.334 --> 10:36.600
Prior to meeting up
with xavier tennant.

10:36.637 --> 10:38.135
Mr. Tennant is a former
romantic partner,

10:38.171 --> 10:39.136
Is that correct?

10:39.172 --> 10:40.604
Objection. Relevance?

10:41.708 --> 10:43.140
Get to the point,
ms. Chen.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.278
Had you gone to
the barracks before?

10:48.148 --> 10:49.681
Yes.

10:49.683 --> 10:52.150
Ms. Chen:
<i> And, uh, describe that</i>
<i> establishment, mr. Spry.</i>

10:53.520 --> 10:54.685
It's a bathhouse.

10:54.721 --> 10:56.688
Ms. Chen:
<i> A place where men</i>
<i> go to hook up,</i>

10:56.823 --> 10:58.089
Party, right?

10:58.125 --> 10:59.624
Yes, but not all the time.

10:59.626 --> 11:01.359
Ms. Chen:
<i> And participate in</i>
<i> recreational drug use?</i>

11:01.494 --> 11:03.795
Objection, madame adjudicator.

11:03.930 --> 11:04.929
Adjudicator:
<i> It's a proper question.</i>

11:04.965 --> 11:05.864
Go ahead.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.098
Christian:
<i> I mean, yes.</i>

11:07.134 --> 11:08.433
<i> There's drug use.</i>

11:08.568 --> 11:09.901
Ms. Chen:
<i> In sergeant baker's note,</i>

11:09.903 --> 11:12.070
<i> You told him you'd used</i>
<i> street drugs before.</i>

11:12.139 --> 11:13.104
I partied in my twenties.

11:13.239 --> 11:14.506
Ms. Chen:
<i> On the night of</i>
<i> your assault,</i>

11:14.508 --> 11:17.241
You alleged you were dosed
with gamma-hydroxybutyric acid,

11:17.310 --> 11:19.511
<i> Or "ghb",</i>
<i> the blackout drug.</i>

11:19.513 --> 11:20.945
Is that correct?

11:21.648 --> 11:22.747
Yes.

11:22.882 --> 11:24.215
Ms. Chen:
<i> In your previous visits</i>
<i> to the barracks,</i>

11:24.251 --> 11:25.649
<i> Had you used ghb before?</i>

11:26.687 --> 11:27.986
Yes.

11:28.121 --> 11:29.354
Ms. Chen:
<i> And do you recall if you</i>
<i> hooked up on those nights</i>

11:29.356 --> 11:30.688
When you took a
blackout drug?

11:30.691 --> 11:32.891
Marcie:
<i> Objection. This case is</i>
<i> about police response,</i>

11:32.893 --> 11:35.793
<i> Not about whether a criminal</i>
<i> offence was committed.</i>

11:35.795 --> 11:36.861
Ms. Diggs is correct.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.529
I think we can move on,
ms. Chen.

11:45.605 --> 11:48.706
So he's a military man
who can't tell time.

11:48.709 --> 11:49.941
Maybe he's still
on sudan time

11:50.076 --> 11:51.709
And thinks we're
meeting for dinner.

11:51.712 --> 11:52.844
Ah.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.012
Here he is.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.749
<i> You made it.</i>

11:58.551 --> 11:59.817
Tyrone:
<i> Of course.</i>

12:01.755 --> 12:04.522
Mr. Thompson,
how do you do?

12:05.391 --> 12:06.591
Ian:
<i> Dad, this is tyrone.</i>

12:08.261 --> 12:11.428
Tyrone, nice to meet you.

12:11.430 --> 12:12.864
Tyrone:
<i> I am sorry I'm late.</i>

12:12.999 --> 12:14.665
<i> The major general is</i>
<i> weighing in on the new</i>

12:14.701 --> 12:16.033
Officer-in-charge appointment.

12:18.371 --> 12:20.105
(stammering) I
don't mean to pry,

12:20.240 --> 12:23.508
But if the new guy in
charge happens to be you,

12:23.643 --> 12:25.843
Doesn't that make
you ian's boss?

12:25.879 --> 12:26.778
<i> Isn't that fraternizing?</i>

12:26.913 --> 12:28.012
<i> Is that allowed?</i>

12:28.048 --> 12:29.581
I mean, let alone
getting married.

12:29.583 --> 12:32.617
Tyrone:
<i> I was ian's immediate</i>
<i> superior when we met.</i>

12:32.619 --> 12:33.684
As soon as it
got serious,

12:33.754 --> 12:35.253
We declared the
personal relationship

12:35.322 --> 12:36.854
<i> To the chain of command.</i>

12:36.923 --> 12:38.690
<i> Now there are</i>
<i> protocols in place.</i>

12:38.825 --> 12:40.724
<i> I'm not involved in</i>
<i> performance reviews,</i>

12:40.761 --> 12:42.560
<i> Decisions about posting,</i>

12:42.695 --> 12:43.995
Duty assignments.

12:45.665 --> 12:46.897
Huh.

12:48.802 --> 12:50.401
I'm sorry, marcie.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.736
Don't apologize.

12:53.139 --> 12:55.807
Their lawyer's job is to poke
holes in your credibility.

12:55.876 --> 12:58.075
It's...It's early days.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.213
Hey, you okay?

13:02.348 --> 13:06.151
All this talk about
bathhouses and drugs.

13:06.286 --> 13:09.020
<i> Did you even consider how this</i>
<i> was going to affect your job?</i>

13:09.089 --> 13:10.355
Our adoption?

13:11.525 --> 13:13.558
Jamie, I went out for
a drink with a friend.

13:13.627 --> 13:15.893
It's not my fault
that I was raped.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.496
<i> The police had no right to</i>
<i>treat me the way that they did.</i>

13:18.498 --> 13:19.897
Do you understand that?

13:20.834 --> 13:22.099
Do you?

13:22.135 --> 13:24.235
(solemn music)

13:24.271 --> 13:25.837
(jamie sighs)

13:25.972 --> 13:30.908
(solemn music)

13:33.480 --> 13:35.647
Hd in algebra

13:35.649 --> 13:38.316
To understand these acronyms
on these police files?

13:38.385 --> 13:40.118
"c.P", "q.T."?

13:40.253 --> 13:42.220
Ellery:
<i> Ah, c.P. Is</i>
<i> "complaining party".</i>

13:42.222 --> 13:44.321
<i> Q.T. Is "secrecy required".</i>

13:44.357 --> 13:45.956
Doug:
<i> What the heck is "o.C."?</i>

13:45.992 --> 13:48.359
Iris:
<i> Maybe the police are fans</i>
<i> of early 2000 teen soaps</i>

13:48.361 --> 13:49.460
Like you, doug.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.896
That was supposed to remain
in the vault, remember?

13:52.032 --> 13:53.865
Iris:
<i> So I shouldn't mention</i>
<i> "pretty little liars"?</i>

13:53.934 --> 13:55.266
No.

13:55.302 --> 13:56.400
Hey, wait,

13:56.436 --> 13:58.002
Fitzpatrick and baker are
all over these documents.

13:58.137 --> 13:59.403
Wasn't there a
third officer?

13:59.472 --> 14:01.205
Marcie:
<i> Constable shadd.</i>

14:01.274 --> 14:03.741
She was on the case briefly,
but then left the force.

14:03.810 --> 14:05.409
Iris:
<i> I reached out to her</i>
<i> when we started the case,</i>

14:05.478 --> 14:06.477
But I've never heard back.

14:06.546 --> 14:07.712
Marcie:
<i> Can you follow</i>
<i> up again?</i>

14:07.714 --> 14:09.113
Maybe she wants
to break rank.

14:09.649 --> 14:10.948
Roger that.

14:10.984 --> 14:14.619
You said you only found two
complaints against baker?

14:14.754 --> 14:16.287
Did you ask around?

14:16.323 --> 14:18.323
He's not the
greatest person

14:18.325 --> 14:19.624
But he has a good
rep as a cop.

14:20.260 --> 14:21.726
According to who?

14:21.861 --> 14:22.994
Ellery:
<i> My mom.</i>

14:22.996 --> 14:24.528
<i> She's an inspector</i>
<i> at the hpd.</i>

14:28.568 --> 14:32.170
Respectfully, I don't need
cops vouching for other cops.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.971
We've got enough of that
going on in the hearing.

14:34.107 --> 14:35.806
Ellery:
<i> I know you're looking</i>
<i> for dirt on the police</i>

14:35.876 --> 14:37.241
To help your case,

14:37.244 --> 14:38.175
But if there's
nothing there-

14:38.245 --> 14:39.209
Just because your
mother said something

14:39.246 --> 14:41.212
Doesn't make it
true, ellery.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.848
<i> And if baker has</i>
<i> even one complaint</i>

14:43.983 --> 14:45.182
That justified a hearing,

14:45.218 --> 14:46.850
You know there's more.

14:46.887 --> 14:48.252
So find out.

15:10.343 --> 15:11.809

15:13.213 --> 15:14.812
Whatever it takes.
-Sure.

15:14.948 --> 15:16.513
See you next week.
-Sure.

15:17.584 --> 15:20.184
Mr. Diggs, I heard
about you and mrs. Diggs.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.386
You guys are good people.

15:24.557 --> 15:25.490
Look at you,

15:25.625 --> 15:27.158
You're always
working an angle.

15:31.631 --> 15:32.964
He just needs space.

15:35.468 --> 15:36.767
Come on in.

15:36.803 --> 15:38.670
Ah, velma told me she filled
you in on fulton's case, right?

15:38.805 --> 15:40.838
Mentioned you had the
case files, yeah.

15:40.907 --> 15:42.507
Thank you for doing this.
Follow me.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.041
No problem.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.643

Avery:
(sighs)<i> okay.</i>

15:51.584 --> 15:52.784
Yeah.

Ms. Chen:

<i>Mr. Spry points to your failure</i>

<i> As evidence of a</i>

16:01.661 --> 16:02.994
It's a train yard.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.729
Any evidence worth gathering
would have been gone

16:04.731 --> 16:05.797
After 48 hours.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.632
There wasn't any point.

16:07.767 --> 16:08.967
Ms. Chen:
<i> Mr. Spry claims</i>

16:09.102 --> 16:11.002
<i> Was not</i>
<i> investigated properly</i>

16:11.071 --> 16:13.071
<i> Because of his</i>

16:13.073 --> 16:14.538
<i> Because he's a gay man.</i>

16:14.574 --> 16:15.807
I've done tons of work

16:15.809 --> 16:17.909
With our equity and
diversity officer.

16:17.911 --> 16:19.877
<i> Part of the training</i>
<i> is to consider factors</i>

16:19.946 --> 16:21.813
<i> Of the lived realities</i>

16:21.815 --> 16:23.013
With every case

16:23.015 --> 16:24.849
Sergeant, have you
ever had any complaints

16:24.851 --> 16:27.751
From the lgbtq+ community
filed against you?

16:27.787 --> 16:29.821
Every officer
gets complaints.

16:29.823 --> 16:31.088
In twenty years,

16:31.224 --> 16:33.524
I've only had two complaints
from that community.

16:33.659 --> 16:35.360
<i> Both were dismissed</i>
<i> as unfounded.</i>

16:36.162 --> 16:37.461
Thank you.

16:40.867 --> 16:45.236
Could you please read
paragraph two on page 14

16:45.305 --> 16:48.239

<i> investigation guidelines".</i>

16:49.876 --> 16:51.843

17:23.476 --> 17:24.808
Objection. Leading.

17:25.779 --> 17:27.779
Ms. Diggs, go about
it another way.

17:29.416 --> 17:31.215
If those are
standard protocols

17:31.217 --> 17:33.150
For handling
sexual assault cases,

17:34.287 --> 17:36.754
What made mr. Spry's
case different?

17:36.756 --> 17:37.955
Baker:
<i> As I mentioned,</i>

17:38.024 --> 17:39.557
<i> Multiple officers</i>
<i> were involved</i>

17:39.559 --> 17:41.425
<i> In mr. Spry's</i>
<i> file before me.</i>

17:41.428 --> 17:43.827
That makes it messy.

<i> Sometimes hard questions have</i>
<i> to be asked more than once.</i>

17:46.566 --> 17:49.567

17:49.569 --> 17:51.802
Xavier tennant,
mr. Spry's friend?

17:51.838 --> 17:53.104
At least two.

17:53.106 --> 17:55.573
And it's your evidence that
he didn't return your call?

17:55.708 --> 17:56.807
I didn't say that.

17:56.843 --> 17:58.075
He returned, eventually.

17:58.210 --> 18:00.378
I took his statement
and put it in the file.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.312
Did you interview
any other witnesses?

18:02.348 --> 18:03.314
Baker:
<i> Look, ms. Diggs,</i>

18:03.383 --> 18:04.982
There were no new
leads to chase down,

18:05.051 --> 18:07.384
No fresh description of
the alleged assailant.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.654
I'm sorry that this is
unsatisfying for your client,

18:09.789 --> 18:12.056
<i> But without a physical</i>
<i> description or dna</i>

18:12.058 --> 18:13.724
I don't know what

18:13.726 --> 18:14.825
Just for you to do your job,
sergeant baker.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.094
Objection.

18:16.229 --> 18:18.495
Really? I'm done

18:18.531 --> 18:19.663
Thank you.

18:19.732 --> 18:23.667
(tense dramatic music)

18:26.806 --> 18:28.505

Isn't this your
old office?

18:29.976 --> 18:31.175
Yes and no.

18:31.310 --> 18:32.543
Uh, a little different.

18:39.285 --> 18:42.153
So, tyrone.

18:43.823 --> 18:44.955
What about him?

18:44.991 --> 18:49.427
Well, he's just a little
older than I had expected.

18:49.562 --> 18:50.928
Fifty-two in may.

18:51.063 --> 18:53.230
Nearly twice your age.

18:53.266 --> 18:54.498
Is that why
you disapprove?

18:54.567 --> 18:55.499
I don't disapprove.

18:55.568 --> 18:56.701
I'm just asking.

18:56.703 --> 18:57.768
He's your commanding officer.

18:57.770 --> 18:58.769
If you two break up,

18:58.771 --> 19:00.471
Are you gonna end
up in a war zone?

19:00.606 --> 19:01.906
Please, dad.
Don't be ridiculous.

19:01.908 --> 19:03.141
Seriously, how
does that work?

19:03.276 --> 19:04.475
Ian:
<i> Like ty said,</i>

19:04.477 --> 19:05.510
There are

19:05.645 --> 19:07.378

<i> Oh come on, ian.</i>

19:07.447 --> 19:08.646
You two break

19:08.781 --> 19:10.714
Who do you think is
gonna come out ahead?

19:11.784 --> 19:13.450
Can you at least just
give him a chance?

19:17.123 --> 19:18.589
We're so happy
you called.

19:18.591 --> 19:20.458
We want to do whatever
we can to support you

In this human rights case.

19:22.095 --> 19:23.461
<i> I pulled all</i>
<i> the materials.</i>

19:23.463 --> 19:25.329

Ellery:
<i> I am focused</i>
<i> on gary baker.</i>

19:36.842 --> 19:38.943
This is baker's failure
not a policing failure.

19:39.078 --> 19:41.478
Cameron:
<i> Just the bad apples</i>
<i> and not the barrel.</i>

19:41.548 --> 19:42.946

19:44.350 --> 19:46.149
Well, if you have
any evidence

19:46.186 --> 19:47.951
That can stand up in
court against gary baker,

19:47.987 --> 19:48.886
Let me know.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.454
I'd love to take
a look at it.

<i> Hey, I've located</i>
<i> constable shadd</i>

19:58.498 --> 19:59.663
<i> In prince edward island.</i>

19:59.732 --> 20:01.331
I mean, she was super
friendly when I first called.

20:01.367 --> 20:04.101
And then I mentioned christian,
and she hung up on me.

20:04.236 --> 20:06.136
Oh, well pack your bags.

20:06.806 --> 20:09.106
You're heading to pei.

<i> Really.</i>

Hey.

20:19.518 --> 20:20.651

<i> Hey.</i>

20:21.921 --> 20:23.654
So I see you
spoke to mom.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.456
Yeah. Yeah, this is insane.

20:25.458 --> 20:26.423
This fulton kid

20:26.492 --> 20:28.492
Is in the backseat of
a guy's car named flex

20:28.494 --> 20:29.393
When the
shooting happened.

20:29.462 --> 20:32.062
He never even laid
eyes on the victim.

20:32.098 --> 20:33.930
Well, what was the evidence?

20:33.967 --> 20:36.200
Witness statement from
the same flex guy

20:36.269 --> 20:38.201
And blood splatter
on fulton's hoodie.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.438
Look at him.

20:42.141 --> 20:43.540
<i> He didn't kill anybody.</i>

20:44.644 --> 20:46.477

kid up, marcie.

20:46.546 --> 20:51.282

20:51.417 --> 20:53.651

20:57.557 --> 20:59.356

our baby back.

21:00.560 --> 21:01.692

<i> Mmm.</i>

21:02.562 --> 21:03.894
Are you guys
back together?

21:05.097 --> 21:06.363
Of course not.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.366
Then what's all this?

21:09.402 --> 21:10.901
Sweetheart,
it's not serious.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.570
Marea:
<i> Man, you guys.</i>

21:13.606 --> 21:15.239
Last time I
came to visit,

21:15.241 --> 21:18.776
I made fifty trips
between hali and eskasoni

21:18.778 --> 21:21.278
Just so you two wouldn't
have to see each other.

21:21.281 --> 21:22.713
<i> Now you pull</i>
<i> this on me?</i>

21:22.848 --> 21:24.581

21:24.717 --> 21:26.517

meeting you both for dinner.

21:27.453 --> 21:28.586

21:28.721 --> 21:30.588
How mature you were
being for my sake.

21:32.458 --> 21:35.059
And you just wanted me in on
your dirty little secret?

21:35.194 --> 21:36.527
<i> I'm so tired of this.</i>

21:38.965 --> 21:40.297

her tomorrow.

30:57.957 --> 31:01.024
<i> They found me bleeding</i>
<i> and half-undressed</i>

31:01.159 --> 31:02.626
<i> At the public gardens.</i>

31:02.628 --> 31:05.228
When I told the cops
I'd been assaulted,

31:05.297 --> 31:08.632
They threatened to charge
me with public indecency.

31:08.634 --> 31:09.900
<i> I complained, too.</i>

31:10.969 --> 31:14.571
<i> Cops met me</i>
<i> after work one day,</i>

31:14.706 --> 31:16.039
Persuaded me to drop it.

31:17.910 --> 31:19.843
Is it okay if I
write this down?

31:19.845 --> 31:22.445
I have already taken
statements from all these men.

31:26.885 --> 31:29.119
Nowak:
<i> You must be</i>
<i> marcie diggs.</i>

31:29.188 --> 31:30.520
<i> And ellery!</i>

31:31.256 --> 31:32.522
Oh, it's nice to see you.

31:32.524 --> 31:35.191
It's been a long time since
your parents barbecue, huh?

31:35.227 --> 31:36.927
Yeah, nice to see
you too, paul.

31:37.062 --> 31:38.929
Marcie:
<i> Thanks for seeing us</i>
<i> on such short notice.</i>

31:39.064 --> 31:40.931
Nowak:
<i> That's what</i>
<i> I'm here for.</i>

31:41.066 --> 31:45.202
We've made such progress
in-in training our officers

31:45.204 --> 31:46.636
<i> To treat marginalized</i>
<i> communities</i>

31:46.705 --> 31:49.473
<i> With increased sensitivity.</i>

31:49.608 --> 31:52.041
<i> It's very sad to see a</i>
<i> case like christian spry</i>

31:52.077 --> 31:53.343
<i> Fall through the</i>
<i> cracks like that.</i>

31:53.379 --> 31:55.278
Marcie:
<i> Indeed.</i>

31:55.347 --> 31:57.981
<i> Well, I'm sure you're</i>
<i> making a huge difference.</i>

31:59.218 --> 32:04.354
Um, we were hoping to have
a look at specific cases

32:04.356 --> 32:07.090
<i> Handled within the</i>
<i> lgbtq+ community.</i>

32:07.225 --> 32:08.692
Specific cases?

32:10.128 --> 32:11.494
These cases.

32:16.902 --> 32:19.636
This is an extremely
unorthodox request.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.671
Ellery:
<i> Paul, I know you care</i>
<i> as much as we do</i>

32:21.707 --> 32:23.840
About improving
police procedures,

32:23.976 --> 32:25.575
<i> So it would be</i>
<i> a huge help</i>

32:25.611 --> 32:27.110
<i> If you could cross</i>
<i> reference that list</i>

32:27.112 --> 32:29.446
With your sexual assault
evidence kits

32:29.448 --> 32:31.247
<i> That you have in storage.</i>

32:31.283 --> 32:32.382
<i> Now we don't</i>
<i> need the kits,</i>

32:32.418 --> 32:34.318
<i> We just need the</i>
<i> associated files.</i>

32:41.593 --> 32:45.061
Okay, but the files need
to stay in this office,

32:45.097 --> 32:46.463
And only for you.

32:55.874 --> 32:57.206
You don't have to do this.

32:58.444 --> 33:00.076
Use the lopez name.

33:00.112 --> 33:01.544
It's, um...

33:02.681 --> 33:04.047
It could have
some blowback.

33:06.351 --> 33:07.717
I know.

33:09.688 --> 33:11.221
Your mother-

33:11.290 --> 33:14.691
It's not about my mother,
it's about me.

33:18.931 --> 33:20.831
This is just the
tip of the iceberg.

33:22.034 --> 33:23.366
There's more downstairs.

33:31.510 --> 33:32.909
"o.C."

33:33.711 --> 33:34.978
<i> "o.C."</i>

33:35.847 --> 33:37.180
<i> "o.C."</i>

33:39.852 --> 33:41.251
"o.C."

33:44.089 --> 33:45.421
They're all marked.
-<i> Yeah.</i>

33:46.091 --> 33:47.390
And unprocessed.

33:51.129 --> 33:54.931
"operation citadel" is just a
shorthand for "low priority".

33:58.670 --> 34:00.337
Cliff:
<i> How are the nachos?</i>

34:00.339 --> 34:01.637
<i> Okay, I'll have two</i>
<i> of those, please.</i>

34:01.673 --> 34:03.006
Yeah. Thank you.

34:05.210 --> 34:06.309
Hey!

34:09.014 --> 34:10.614
Wow, you look beautiful.

34:10.749 --> 34:11.615
Iris:
<i> Thank you.</i>

34:11.750 --> 34:13.116
Cliff:
<i> Yes, yes.</i>

34:17.823 --> 34:19.689
Now see, there's a
lot more lawyer jokes

34:19.691 --> 34:21.290
Than minister jokes.

34:21.326 --> 34:22.959
Let me hear one.

34:23.028 --> 34:24.895
Everyone says lawyers
are going to hell,

34:24.897 --> 34:26.296
But I don't
believe it though.

34:26.365 --> 34:27.431
Why not?

34:27.566 --> 34:29.299
Because god
loves overachievers.

34:31.403 --> 34:33.302
Created the world in six days,
didn't he?

34:35.373 --> 34:36.573
(iris giggles)

34:36.708 --> 34:37.841
Yeah.

34:40.212 --> 34:42.045
<i> I wouldn't quit my day</i>
<i> job if I were you.</i>

34:43.014 --> 34:45.982
(chuckles) yeah, my, um-

34:45.984 --> 34:47.717
Can't mind your business?

34:48.386 --> 34:49.685
Can you reverend?

34:51.857 --> 34:53.189
Superintendent costello.

34:54.860 --> 34:57.126
Fulton parker's case
deserves another look.

34:57.128 --> 34:58.928
You didn't want to
oversee a review.

34:58.997 --> 35:00.530
Just remember,

35:00.532 --> 35:02.933
If you kick
dirt in my face,

35:03.068 --> 35:04.133
I hit back.

35:04.269 --> 35:06.069
Dad, come on.

35:12.077 --> 35:13.476
Marcie:
<i> Sergeant baker,</i>

35:13.545 --> 35:17.547
Can you please explain
the "o.C." notation

35:17.583 --> 35:19.649
On these
sexual assault files?

35:19.784 --> 35:21.684
It's just a notation.

35:21.753 --> 35:23.686
But what does it mean?

35:23.722 --> 35:25.355
Baker:
<i> We scribble all sorts</i>
<i> of stuff on files,</i>

35:25.490 --> 35:28.891
<i> Maybe "other course"</i>
<i> or "only copy"?</i>

35:28.927 --> 35:30.827
Sergeant, are you
familiar with the term

35:30.896 --> 35:32.496
Operation citadel?

35:32.631 --> 35:35.064
It was an undercover
sting in the late nineties.

35:36.101 --> 35:37.300
Targeting gay men?

35:37.435 --> 35:38.835
It was focused
on individuals

35:38.970 --> 35:41.972
Participating in public
indecency and trespassing.

35:42.107 --> 35:44.975
Marcie:
<i> But community activists</i>
<i> saw it as unfairly targeting</i>

35:45.110 --> 35:47.443
Men having
sex with men.

35:47.445 --> 35:49.546
<i> That operation</i>
<i> ended in 2002,</i>

35:49.548 --> 35:53.650
<i> And those files also</i>
<i> feature the "o.C." notation,</i>

35:53.719 --> 35:55.452
<i> Is that correct?</i>

35:55.587 --> 35:56.586
Yes.

35:56.622 --> 35:58.488
Marcie:
<i> So these two</i>
<i> sets of files</i>

35:58.557 --> 36:01.258
<i> Relating to two separate</i>
<i> police operations</i>

36:01.260 --> 36:04.060
<i> Sharing the same notation,</i>

36:04.129 --> 36:08.064
But the only detail that they
share in terms of the context

36:08.133 --> 36:11.901
Is the sexual orientation
of the complainants?

36:11.970 --> 36:13.570
Coincidence.

36:13.572 --> 36:16.640
Marcie:
<i> You mentioned earlier</i>
<i> you'd been the subject</i>

36:16.775 --> 36:20.743
Of two complaints from
the lgbtq+ community.

36:23.148 --> 36:24.614
But that's not quite true,
is it?

36:28.287 --> 36:30.820
Two complaints made
it to a hearing,

36:30.856 --> 36:34.757
But the actual number
of filed complaints

36:34.793 --> 36:38.127
Was over ten times that.

36:38.163 --> 36:40.096
<i> Joe rogers,</i>

36:40.132 --> 36:42.131
<i> Earl mckinnon,</i>

36:42.201 --> 36:44.201
Roaul proulx,

36:44.336 --> 36:46.369
Each of these men were
sexually assaulted,

36:46.504 --> 36:50.573
And you were the investigating
officer on those cases.

36:50.642 --> 36:52.842
<i> Each filed a</i>
<i> complaint against you</i>

36:52.978 --> 36:54.977
<i> For not investigating</i>
<i> their cases properly.</i>

36:54.979 --> 36:59.849
I mean, you didn't even
process their rape kits.

36:59.851 --> 37:00.783
Objection.

37:00.852 --> 37:01.951
Adjudicator:
<i> Overruled.</i>

37:01.987 --> 37:03.386
Continue, ms. Diggs.

37:05.857 --> 37:08.391
You have a problem with
gay men, sergeant baker?

37:08.526 --> 37:10.327
We're allowed to
use our discretion.

37:10.329 --> 37:12.995
System would be bankrupt if
we processed every rape kit.

37:13.031 --> 37:14.130
The investigating officer

37:14.132 --> 37:15.131
Doesn't think the
case warrants it,

37:15.133 --> 37:17.133
We don't process the kits.

37:17.135 --> 37:20.002
Marcie:
<i> And yet the percentage</i>
<i> of unprocessed kits</i>

37:20.038 --> 37:24.007
From queer victims of
assault is vastly higher

37:24.009 --> 37:27.510
Than the percentage of kits
from the general population.

37:27.546 --> 37:29.745
Circumstances in those
cases were different.

37:29.747 --> 37:31.281
What circumstances?

37:31.350 --> 37:32.615
Baker:
<i> We can't respond</i>
<i> to every case</i>

37:32.684 --> 37:34.284
With the same
amount of manpower.

37:34.419 --> 37:36.286
We have to factor in
community considerations.

37:36.355 --> 37:39.022
If we pursued every report that
came in from that community,

37:39.024 --> 37:40.123
<i> The department</i>
<i> would be overrun.</i>

37:40.192 --> 37:42.224
And when you say
that community,

37:42.261 --> 37:43.760
Who do you mean exactly?

37:43.829 --> 37:46.295
Baker:
<i> I mean grown men who are</i>
<i> going out to get drunk,</i>

37:46.331 --> 37:47.564
Get high and get
laid in places

37:47.699 --> 37:49.432
No respectable
person would go to.

37:49.468 --> 37:51.368
Parks, bathhouses,
train yards,

37:51.503 --> 37:52.502
You name it.

37:52.504 --> 37:53.969
They put themselves in
dangerous situations

37:54.006 --> 37:56.106
And expect us to
dedicate resources

37:56.241 --> 37:58.575
When they party too hard
and things go sideways.

37:58.710 --> 38:00.110
Every cop on the beat
understands that.

38:00.245 --> 38:01.578
You learn from day one.

38:10.722 --> 38:12.154
That'll be all.

38:17.596 --> 38:19.396
Marea, please talk to me.

38:19.398 --> 38:21.364
Dad, I don't have
time for drama.

38:21.400 --> 38:22.698
I'm gonna miss my flight.

38:22.734 --> 38:24.334
At least let me drive
you to the airport.

38:24.403 --> 38:25.402
Save you a few bucks.

38:25.404 --> 38:26.303
And spend the next hour

38:26.438 --> 38:29.405
Listening to your
lies and excuses?

38:29.541 --> 38:32.542
<i> You know what really</i>
<i> pisses me off?</i>

38:32.544 --> 38:35.411
The way you think
I'm so stupid.

38:35.547 --> 38:37.814
Like I wouldn't find
out about you and mom,

38:37.883 --> 38:39.682
Or that you didn't
care what I thought.

38:39.718 --> 38:41.050
I do care.

38:43.388 --> 38:45.187
I just didn't think.

38:45.223 --> 38:46.723
<i> I didn't think about you.</i>

38:46.725 --> 38:48.724
<i> I mean, I've always felt bad</i>
<i> about what I did to your mom,</i>

38:48.760 --> 38:50.493
And to you kids
in the past.

38:52.097 --> 38:55.298
I didn't think about how
it'd affect you as an adult.

38:55.433 --> 38:57.032
<i> I'm glad that you</i>
<i> made me notice.</i>

38:59.971 --> 39:01.704
The things a person has
to do in this family

39:01.773 --> 39:03.105
For some attention.

39:04.943 --> 39:07.143
<i> I walked out of a</i>
<i> lobster dinner!</i>

39:07.179 --> 39:08.778
After you finished
your roll.

39:10.949 --> 39:12.915
Did I make us late again?

39:12.984 --> 39:14.851
Sorry to keep you waiting.

39:14.853 --> 39:16.519
Reggie:
<i> No no no,</i>
<i> you're early.</i>

39:16.654 --> 39:18.722
<i> I-I was earlier.</i>

39:18.857 --> 39:19.922
Glad you could make it.

39:19.958 --> 39:20.990
Are you kidding?

39:21.125 --> 39:22.859
Ian has told me so much
about sailing with you

39:22.994 --> 39:24.593
When he was growing up.

39:24.629 --> 39:26.296
<i> I am really looking</i>
<i> forward to this.</i>

39:26.298 --> 39:27.797
Yeah, we had
some good times.

39:29.134 --> 39:31.468
Uh, are those the
only shoes you got?

39:31.470 --> 39:33.403
Ian:
<i> Please dad, don't</i>
<i> start with the shoes.</i>

39:33.472 --> 39:34.471
Reggie:
<i> I'm not criticizing.</i>

39:34.606 --> 39:35.938
It's a safety issue.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.811
Look, uh, tyrone,

39:41.946 --> 39:44.881
Ah, I have not been
as welcoming to you

39:44.883 --> 39:46.148
As I should have been.

39:46.184 --> 39:47.683
The truth is,

39:47.719 --> 39:49.486
<i> I didn't know how hard</i>
<i> it was gonna hit me</i>

39:49.621 --> 39:52.288
When suddenly ian
shows up, and with you,

39:52.424 --> 39:54.890
And announces he's
gonna get married.

39:54.926 --> 39:56.025
Tyrone:
(chuckles)<i> yeah, I get it.</i>

39:56.094 --> 39:57.026
<i> The truth is,</i>

39:57.095 --> 39:59.295
<i> He kind of took me</i>
<i> by surprise too.</i>

39:59.431 --> 40:02.265
You have a fine son there,
mr. Thompson.

40:02.400 --> 40:03.699
It's reggie.

40:06.371 --> 40:07.703
Thanks, dad.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.073
(reggie chuckles)

40:10.075 --> 40:11.407
Okay, let's go sailing.

40:11.410 --> 40:12.909
But those won't do.
What size are you?

40:12.911 --> 40:14.710
I think I might have some
extra boat shoes in my car.

40:14.746 --> 40:15.778
Oh don't worry.

40:15.780 --> 40:17.513
<i> These have gum</i>
<i> rubber soles.</i>

40:17.582 --> 40:19.983
<i> Best deck shoes</i>
<i> I've found so far.</i>

40:20.118 --> 40:21.184
Tyrone used to
be an instructor

40:21.253 --> 40:22.685
With the canadian forces
sailing association

40:22.754 --> 40:24.420
At munroe head.

40:24.456 --> 40:26.823
Ah, well played.

40:26.958 --> 40:29.291
(chuckling)

40:30.629 --> 40:33.596
Could be a few months before
we receive a formal judgement,

40:33.598 --> 40:37.066
But I'm confident
things will go our way.

40:40.405 --> 40:42.004
I expected you
to be happier.

40:44.910 --> 40:46.476
Is it the job or?

40:47.913 --> 40:49.412
Christian:
<i> No, the school is</i>
<i> keeping me on.</i>

40:49.481 --> 40:50.680
Oh.

40:52.350 --> 40:53.683
It's jamie.

40:54.453 --> 40:55.718
We're gonna get a divorce.

40:57.088 --> 40:58.888
Oh, christian.

40:58.924 --> 41:03.058
No marcie, it was a
long time coming.

41:04.162 --> 41:05.695
He has this fantasy that
we're cam and mitchell

41:05.764 --> 41:07.096
From modern family.

41:08.333 --> 41:09.732
It's not me.

41:10.635 --> 41:12.067
I'm messy.

41:13.238 --> 41:17.907
And I'm of pretending to
be something that I'm not.

41:18.042 --> 41:21.911
So you're saying all
this was worth it?

41:23.114 --> 41:24.647
It doesn't change
what happened.

41:25.684 --> 41:27.483
And it doesn't put
people behind bars.

41:30.855 --> 41:32.621
But it's good to
feel like I matter.

41:35.227 --> 41:36.859
That the system
finally admitted

41:36.895 --> 41:40.963
That what happened to
me wasn't my fault.

41:40.999 --> 41:42.631
<i> But check on me</i>
<i> in a few months.</i>

41:44.703 --> 41:45.869
I promise.

41:50.008 --> 41:51.941
Twice in one week.

41:51.977 --> 41:54.077
I'm happy to see you,
but is everything okay?

41:56.514 --> 41:57.814
You weren't straight
with me before

41:57.816 --> 41:59.782
When I asked you
about gary baker.

41:59.784 --> 42:01.116
What are you
talking about?

42:01.152 --> 42:02.952
You told me he
was a good cop.

42:03.822 --> 42:05.088
Mom, I just found
out that he's-

42:06.491 --> 42:07.490
He's terrible.

42:07.492 --> 42:08.824
He's the worst
kind of cop.

42:08.860 --> 42:09.892
And he just gets
away with it

42:09.928 --> 42:12.161
Because so many other
cops take it for granted

42:12.163 --> 42:15.698
That they can mistreat
and ignore lgbtq+ people.

42:15.700 --> 42:18.301
And I just don't understand
how you didn't know that.

42:20.238 --> 42:23.005
Baker is a macho jerk.

42:23.041 --> 42:25.708
<i> The system and some</i>
<i> of the people in it</i>

42:25.744 --> 42:27.310
<i> Are far from perfect.</i>

42:29.047 --> 42:30.379
Sometimes...

42:31.449 --> 42:32.982
Sometimes people fall
through the cracks.

42:36.254 --> 42:37.520
What about me, mom?

42:38.723 --> 42:40.322
What if I fall
through the cracks

42:40.358 --> 42:42.792
And get treated like
christian spry or abe hirsch?

42:44.563 --> 42:45.794
That's okay with you?

42:45.830 --> 42:47.196
Don't be ridiculous.

42:48.533 --> 42:50.600
I would never let
that happen to you.

42:52.337 --> 42:53.669
You're family.

42:58.743 --> 43:00.175
<i> We protect our own.</i>

43:03.147 --> 43:08.017
<i> ♪ goodbye baby,</i>
<i> all the love is gone</i>

43:11.590 --> 43:15.024
<i> ♪ goodbye baby,</i>
<i> tonight I'm moving on ♪</i>
