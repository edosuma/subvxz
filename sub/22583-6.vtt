00:07.364 --> 00:09.125
Hoshi.

00:10.800 --> 00:13.254
Hello?

00:18.265 --> 00:20.032
Do you understand me?

00:27.080 --> 00:29.187
I think you do.

00:32.665 --> 00:34.823
Can you see me?

00:37.158 --> 00:38.848
Ensign Sato to Security!

00:38.848 --> 00:40.781
Go ahead.

00:40.781 --> 00:42.711
Hoshi?

00:42.711 --> 00:45.119
Is everything all right?

00:45.119 --> 00:47.585
Hoshi?

00:49.798 --> 00:53.973
Song: "Faith of the Heart"
It's been a long road,

00:53.973 --> 00:57.430
Getting from there to here,

00:57.430 --> 01:01.276
It's been a long time,

01:01.276 --> 01:05.272
But my time is finally near,

01:05.272 --> 01:09.351
And I will see my dream come alive at last,

01:09.351 --> 01:12.979
I will touch the sky

01:12.979 --> 01:16.710
And they're not gonna hold me down no more,

01:16.710 --> 01:19.881
No they're not gonna change my mind,

01:19.881 --> 01:24.682
Cause I've got faith of the heart,

01:24.682 --> 01:27.654
I'm going where my heart will take me,

01:27.654 --> 01:32.591
I've got faith to believe,

01:32.591 --> 01:35.297
I can do anything,

01:35.297 --> 01:42.934
I've got strength of the soul,
But no one gonna bend or break me,

01:42.934 --> 01:48.773
I can reach, any star,

01:48.773 --> 01:52.547
I've got faith,

01:52.547 --> 02:00.122
I've got faith, faith of the heart.

02:11.378 --> 02:15.478
058 (3x06) Exile

02:15.478 --> 02:20.588
I thought I was the only one who lived here during my off-hours.

02:20.588 --> 02:23.283
I'd like you to see this.

02:23.283 --> 02:28.289
These are the locations where we've encountered spatial anomalies.

02:28.289 --> 02:31.957
I analyzed the sensor logs from the Xindi database.

02:31.957 --> 02:35.278
These are the coordinates where that vessel was affected.

02:35.278 --> 02:37.314
Seems pretty random.

02:37.314 --> 02:39.792
That's what I thought, until I ran a vector analysis

02:39.792 --> 02:43.495
of the gravimetric waves coming from the Sphere we discovered.

02:43.495 --> 02:49.364
The interference pattern implies another wave source.

02:51.897 --> 02:53.175
A second Sphere.

02:53.175 --> 02:56.354
It appears so.

02:56.354 --> 03:01.349
The simulation suggests that the anomalies occur where the waves intersect.

03:01.349 --> 03:04.375
If you're right, then we should be able to start predicting

03:04.375 --> 03:06.225
where we're going to run into trouble.

03:06.225 --> 03:08.065
If we're going to create an accurate map,

03:08.065 --> 03:11.449
we'll need precise measurements of the Sphere's gravimetric fields.

03:11.449 --> 03:16.799
Assuming there is a second Sphere, how far away is it?

03:16.799 --> 03:19.836
Less than four light years.

03:19.836 --> 03:21.616
Set a course.

03:30.928 --> 03:32.295
Nothing?

03:32.295 --> 03:34.378
I ran every scan in the book.

03:34.378 --> 03:37.480
There's no sign of any intruder anywhere on the ship.

03:37.480 --> 03:39.668
Maybe our sensors missed something.

03:39.668 --> 03:42.306
I went through all the logs for the past 24 hours.

03:42.306 --> 03:45.581
To say they were uneventful would be an understatement.

03:45.581 --> 03:46.357
This is good news.

03:46.357 --> 03:48.823
That I'm imagining things?

03:48.823 --> 03:53.573
When you're a little on edge, it's not uncommon to see "the enemy" out of the corner of your eye.

03:53.573 --> 03:56.269
I thought that was called paranoia.

03:56.269 --> 04:00.219
Whatever it is, it's not uncommon.

04:00.219 --> 04:05.026
Just the other night, I thought I heard clicking sounds in my quarters.

04:05.026 --> 04:09.503
For a moment I could've sworn there was a Xindi-Insectoid lurking in the shadows.

04:09.503 --> 04:12.303
What I saw wasn't a shadow.

04:13.375 --> 04:15.771
All right.

04:15.771 --> 04:17.892
I'll keep an eye out.

04:21.601 --> 04:25.316
There's some mild vasodilation in the prefrontal cortex...

04:25.316 --> 04:27.103
that would account for your headaches.

04:27.103 --> 04:29.318
Other than that, you're in perfect health.

04:29.318 --> 04:32.244
Are there any more tests that you can run?

04:32.244 --> 04:34.315
What do you expect me to find?

04:34.315 --> 04:37.024
The last few days, I've had the strangest feeling

04:37.024 --> 04:40.569
that I am being watched.

04:40.569 --> 04:46.661
I've heard whispering down corridors... in my quarters.

04:46.661 --> 04:48.202
Could I have been exposed to something

04:48.202 --> 04:50.586
that's making me hallucinate?

04:50.586 --> 04:53.784
There's no evidence of any mind-altering substances on board.

04:53.784 --> 04:56.522
So basically, this is all in my head.

04:56.522 --> 04:58.232
It appears to be.

04:58.232 --> 04:59.659
Great.

04:59.659 --> 05:03.155
I suppose you believe you're dealing badly with stress.

05:03.155 --> 05:07.518
It's not a good sign when you start to see things that aren't there.

05:07.518 --> 05:10.183
That's a matter of opinion.

05:10.183 --> 05:13.601
On Denobula, when a person under stress hallucinates,

05:13.601 --> 05:17.612
it's considered healthy-- a harmless way for the subconscious

05:17.612 --> 05:19.775
to release nervous energy.

05:19.775 --> 05:22.124
I've always envied those who had that facility.

05:22.124 --> 05:25.614
I tend to keep too much bottled up inside.

05:25.614 --> 05:27.097
I should get going.

05:27.097 --> 05:30.664
T'Pol's asked me to translate a section of the Xindi database.

05:42.176 --> 05:44.281
Hoshi.

05:51.477 --> 05:57.767
That's where I'm waiting for you.
That's where I'm waiting for you.

05:57.767 --> 06:00.316
Ensign Sato to Lieutenant Reed.

06:00.316 --> 06:01.735
I need help in the Command Center.

06:01.735 --> 06:05.969
- Hoshi.
- Who are you?

06:05.969 --> 06:09.736
Don't be frightened.

06:26.019 --> 06:28.011
Hoshi.

06:28.011 --> 06:29.618
How did you get aboard?

06:29.618 --> 06:33.521
I'm nowhere near your ship.

06:33.521 --> 06:34.835
What do you want?

06:34.835 --> 06:36.491
You're searching for something.

06:36.491 --> 06:38.663
I can help.

07:16.305 --> 07:17.935
Hoshi...

07:17.935 --> 07:21.694
Are you all right?

07:21.694 --> 07:24.858
I'm not picking up anything out of the ordinary.

07:24.858 --> 07:29.842
We still haven't found any ships nearby, or any "uninvited guests" on board.

07:29.842 --> 07:31.533
I'm not imagining it, Captain.

07:31.533 --> 07:33.214
You have to admit, it's a possibility.

07:33.214 --> 07:36.812
With respect, sir, I know that my mind can be overactive sometimes,

07:36.812 --> 07:38.716
but that is not what's happening.

07:38.716 --> 07:40.583
This is real!

07:41.666 --> 07:47.979
I want you to keep Hoshi under observation until we can sort this out.

07:47.979 --> 07:49.613
Post a security detail outside,

07:49.613 --> 07:52.545
and assign teams to Engineering and the Armory until further notice.

07:52.545 --> 07:54.721
Are you expecting an attack, sir?

07:54.721 --> 07:57.908
Around here, you never know.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.694
I'll see you both in the morning.

08:05.358 --> 08:07.269
Isn't it about feeding time?

08:07.269 --> 08:09.371
I'll take care of it after I get you settled.

08:09.371 --> 08:10.722
Would you mind?

08:10.722 --> 08:12.373
I'm really not that tired.

08:12.373 --> 08:13.391
Be my guest.

08:13.391 --> 08:16.036
The Vulcan root leaf's in the container.

08:20.606 --> 08:25.053
That's strange.

08:25.053 --> 08:27.839
It's...

08:27.839 --> 08:32.669
When the alien communicates with me, it's...

08:32.669 --> 08:34.697
it's almost like he's inside my head

08:34.697 --> 08:37.640
looking at things through my eyes...

08:37.640 --> 08:42.102
experiencing what I'm experiencing.

08:42.102 --> 08:44.830
Talking to him is like talking to myself.

08:44.830 --> 08:46.706
Does that make any sense?

08:46.706 --> 08:49.902
It makes perfect sense.

08:49.902 --> 08:52.758
Listening to your thoughts has been very pleasurable.

08:52.758 --> 08:53.948
What?

08:53.948 --> 08:56.366
I've been with you for several days,

08:56.366 --> 08:59.511
studying your mind, your memories--

08:59.511 --> 09:02.057
learning so many things about you.

09:02.057 --> 09:03.306
Why me?

09:03.306 --> 09:06.458
My telepathy only works in rare instances.

09:06.458 --> 09:09.378
It takes a unique mind to process it.

09:09.378 --> 09:12.908
Yours is the first I've found in many years.

09:12.908 --> 09:15.038
What do you want?

09:16.388 --> 09:18.830
I'm only three light years away.

09:18.830 --> 09:21.906
My home is what you're seeing right now.

09:21.906 --> 09:24.747
All I want is to meet you.

09:24.747 --> 09:26.709
I don't think that'll be possible.

09:26.709 --> 09:29.441
I know you're on an urgent mission.

09:29.441 --> 09:33.595
That's what I want to talk to you about.

09:33.595 --> 09:35.469
What did he tell you about the Xindi?

09:35.469 --> 09:40.260
He's saving that for my visit.

09:40.260 --> 09:43.727
He could've given you something as a show of good faith.

09:43.727 --> 09:47.101
This could be another attempt by the Xindi to infiltrate Enterprise.

09:47.101 --> 09:48.578
I think he wants to help.

09:48.578 --> 09:51.223
He was horrified that seven million of us were killed.

09:51.223 --> 09:55.045
He says he's willing to use his abilities to help us find the Xindi.

09:55.045 --> 09:58.683
I think that's reason enough to meet with him.

10:05.109 --> 10:11.441
- Archer to Mayweather.
- Go ahead, sir.

10:11.441 --> 10:14.270
We're taking a slight detour.

11:23.890 --> 11:29.020
I asked Hoshi to come alone.

11:29.020 --> 11:32.850
The captain's always a part of first-contact missions.

11:32.850 --> 11:34.857
Starfleet regulations.

11:34.857 --> 11:37.194
I hope that's not a problem.

11:37.194 --> 11:39.555
Not at all, Captain.

11:39.555 --> 11:44.600
I'm pleased all three of you could come.

11:52.919 --> 11:56.332
My name is Tarquin.

11:56.332 --> 12:00.504
I'm obviously not what you expected.

12:00.504 --> 12:06.848
I didn't want to frighten you, so I created a human image when I contacted you on Enterprise.

12:06.848 --> 12:09.781
Thank you for coming to me.

12:09.781 --> 12:12.865
You said you could help us with our mission.

12:12.865 --> 12:16.631
You're searching for a weapon that could annihilate your planet.

12:16.631 --> 12:22.447
I may be able to find it... but I'll need an object that's associated with the Xindi.

12:22.447 --> 12:23.657
Why?

12:23.657 --> 12:27.584
Every artifact retains an imprint of the people who made it...

12:27.584 --> 12:29.469
who used it...

12:29.469 --> 12:32.803
I have the ability to sense those imprints.

12:32.803 --> 12:35.631
I could arrange to have something sent down.

12:35.631 --> 12:37.720
How much time would you need with it?

12:37.720 --> 12:39.841
No more than a few days.

12:39.841 --> 12:41.737
We didn't pick up any other bio-signs.

12:41.737 --> 12:45.220
I take it you live here alone.

12:45.220 --> 12:46.513
Alone.

12:46.513 --> 12:49.987
It's an awfully big planet for one person.

12:49.987 --> 12:54.395
I've lived here for a very long time, Mr. Reed.

12:54.395 --> 12:59.604
My only contact with the outside world has been through telepathy.

12:59.604 --> 13:00.944
Bring me the artifact.

13:00.944 --> 13:03.338
I'd like to get started.

13:04.503 --> 13:06.576
We'll be back as soon as we can.

13:06.576 --> 13:11.553
Captain... one small request.

13:11.553 --> 13:14.834
I'd like Hoshi to stay with me while I'm working.

13:17.309 --> 13:19.310
I'm afraid that's not appropriate.

13:19.310 --> 13:26.095
Nonetheless... it's a condition of my helping you.

13:28.973 --> 13:33.197
If I'm comfortable with this...

13:33.197 --> 13:35.211
I don't get the sense that he would harm me.

13:35.211 --> 13:37.189
My instincts tell me otherwise.

13:37.189 --> 13:38.961
He's hiding something.

13:38.961 --> 13:42.732
If he's insistent, we could put off looking for the Sphere...

13:42.732 --> 13:44.376
stay in orbit.

13:44.376 --> 13:45.333
It's only for a few days.

13:45.333 --> 13:49.633
the luxury of dealing with one problem at a time anymore, sir.

13:49.633 --> 13:55.600
If he can tell us something about the Xindi weapon, it's worth the risk.

13:56.140 --> 14:01.199
I can take care of myself, Captain.

14:06.003 --> 14:08.976
This is from the weapon that attacked your planet.

14:08.976 --> 14:13.480
We think it was a prototype for a much larger weapon.

14:13.480 --> 14:16.418
This will be very useful.

14:16.418 --> 14:19.913
- May I?
- Thanks.

14:22.913 --> 14:27.155
- I need a minute.
- Take your time.

14:31.662 --> 14:33.760
Do I have to tell you to stay on your toes?

14:33.760 --> 14:37.752
I think that falls under the "goes without saying" category, sir.

14:38.830 --> 14:40.367
Did you did bring a phase-pistol?

14:40.367 --> 14:43.386
I'll keep it under my pillow.

14:46.482 --> 14:48.517
You know how to reach me.

15:03.299 --> 15:05.779
Do you always eat like this?

15:05.779 --> 15:11.369
Only when I have company.

15:11.369 --> 15:12.868
Thank you.

15:12.868 --> 15:17.157
I thought you might enjoy something familiar.

15:20.824 --> 15:22.939
Programming these dishes was a challenge.

15:22.939 --> 15:27.963
I had to recreate their tastes and textures from your memory.

15:27.963 --> 15:31.238
Please.

15:34.174 --> 15:41.981
It should approximate the recipe from Fiorella's on Fountain Street in San Francisco.

15:43.274 --> 15:45.704
You've certainly done your homework.

15:45.704 --> 15:47.671
I've enjoyed it.

15:47.671 --> 15:49.326
Mmm, what's this?

15:49.326 --> 15:51.531
Dessert.

15:51.531 --> 15:54.529
It's a delicacy from the Arakon System.

15:54.529 --> 15:56.431
I think you'll like it.

15:56.431 --> 15:59.552
You know, my stomach is a little unsettled.

15:59.552 --> 16:03.343
You told your grandmother that every time she tried to serve you soba noodles.

16:03.343 --> 16:06.728
Now, it's one your favorite foods.

16:06.728 --> 16:10.135
Since you seem to know so much about my past,

16:10.135 --> 16:12.972
I think it's only fair that I know a little about yours.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.635
Where are you from?

16:14.635 --> 16:18.667
My home world is 30 light years from here.

16:18.667 --> 16:23.732
A wonderful place to live... provided you're not born telepathic.

16:23.732 --> 16:27.195
The odds are one in 50 million.

16:27.195 --> 16:30.434
I was among the unlucky few.

16:30.434 --> 16:33.661
We're considered a threat to the rest of the population.

16:33.661 --> 16:36.759
There's only one solution for people like me...

16:36.759 --> 16:39.425
to live out our lives in exile.

16:39.425 --> 16:43.650
So we're sent to places like this.

16:43.650 --> 16:45.045
To solitude...

16:45.045 --> 16:47.930
I think you're familiar with it.

16:47.930 --> 16:49.591
What do you mean?

16:49.591 --> 16:54.680
Your parents learned you were gifted, so you spent your childhood

16:54.680 --> 16:58.642
with private tutors, studying languages.

16:58.642 --> 17:03.114
You thought it was normal to go through your days alone.

17:05.363 --> 17:11.421
I'm sorry... I forget you're unaware of how much I know about you.

17:11.421 --> 17:14.470
Are you reading my mind... continuously?

17:14.470 --> 17:17.040
Not since you've arrived.

17:17.040 --> 17:18.104
Now that you're here with me,

17:18.104 --> 17:22.948
I would rather get to know you the way other humans do.

17:22.948 --> 17:27.214
This is great, but I'm pretty tired.

17:27.214 --> 17:30.223
Of course.

17:33.931 --> 17:38.161
If you need anything else, you let me know at supper tomorrow.

17:38.161 --> 17:40.705
I'll be working most of the day.

17:40.705 --> 17:43.041
Feel free to wander.

17:43.041 --> 17:46.619
There are a lot of interesting things here.

17:46.619 --> 17:50.510
But I strongly suggest that you stay inside.

17:50.510 --> 17:53.176
The winds can be treacherous.

17:53.176 --> 17:56.169
I'm sure there's enough to keep me occupied.

17:56.169 --> 18:00.333
If you'd like, you could spend some time looking at this.

18:00.333 --> 18:03.615
It's written in a dead language, over a thousand years old.

18:03.615 --> 18:05.492
Everything about these people:

18:05.492 --> 18:10.253
their homeworld, their culture, has vanished into time.

18:10.253 --> 18:13.640
Thank you.

18:15.769 --> 18:18.991
You don't have to feel alone.

18:18.991 --> 18:20.432
I won't.

18:20.432 --> 18:21.843
I'll be busy with this.

18:21.843 --> 18:24.107
That's not what I meant.

18:24.107 --> 18:28.649
You often feel isolated, even around other people.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.565
You don't have to.

18:59.036 --> 19:02.076
- Archer to the Bridge.
- Yes, Captain.

19:02.076 --> 19:03.788
I assume we're getting close.

19:03.788 --> 19:06.051
You assume correctly.

19:06.051 --> 19:07.352
Take us out  warp.

19:07.352 --> 19:08.438
- I'm on my way.
- Yes, sir

19:28.750 --> 19:29.327
Status.

19:29.327 --> 19:31.953
We're getting reports of anomalies on all decks.

19:51.983 --> 19:53.881
Breaches on decks B, C and E.

19:53.881 --> 19:58.368
Emergency bulkheads are in place, but three subsections have decompressed.

20:05.828 --> 20:07.998
We're losing structural integrity in the forward hull.

20:07.998 --> 20:09.506
All stop!

20:11.079 --> 20:12.527
The anomalies are stronger here.

20:12.527 --> 20:14.680
If there is another Sphere in the region,

20:14.680 --> 20:17.864
it's emitting a lot more gravimetric energy than the first one.

20:17.864 --> 20:19.502
Which means if we continue,

20:19.502 --> 20:23.220
there's a good chance this ship is going to get torn apart.

20:23.220 --> 20:25.558
If it is there, how far?

20:25.558 --> 20:28.188
Approximately 75,000 kilometers.

20:28.188 --> 20:31.948
It might as well be 75 light years.

20:31.948 --> 20:34.609
- Bridge to Commander Tucker.
- Go ahead.

20:34.609 --> 20:37.863
How are your engines holding up?

20:37.863 --> 20:40.487
So far so good, but I wouldn't recommend

20:40.487 --> 20:42.296
putting them through a lot more of this.

20:42.296 --> 20:45.623
How long would it take you to insulate a shuttle pod with trellium-D?

20:45.623 --> 20:48.543
I'd need a day to refine enough ore, and, uh,

20:48.543 --> 20:50.873
at least 12 hours to reconfigure the hull.

20:50.873 --> 20:51.754
Get started.

20:51.754 --> 20:53.095
Aye, sir.

20:53.095 --> 20:55.141
Hold our position.

20:55.728 --> 20:59.339
You might want to steer clear of the Launch Bay for the next couple of days.

20:59.339 --> 21:00.983
Indeed.

21:27.337 --> 21:29.703
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you.

21:29.703 --> 21:31.657
Not at all.

21:31.657 --> 21:34.083
Please.

21:44.460 --> 21:47.609
Have you had a chance to look at the book I gave you?

21:47.609 --> 21:50.051
I'm about halfway through.

21:50.051 --> 21:52.778
I didn't expect you to translate it so quickly.

21:52.778 --> 21:55.937
Aren't you supposed to know me better than that?

21:55.937 --> 21:58.474
And what did you think of it?

21:58.474 --> 22:00.778
It's an interesting language.

22:00.778 --> 22:03.731
Reminds me of medieval Klingon.

22:03.731 --> 22:05.836
Any progress?

22:05.836 --> 22:09.289
A few images... impressions.

22:09.289 --> 22:12.537
Did you know that there are five Xindi species?

22:12.537 --> 22:13.838
That's what we've heard.

22:13.838 --> 22:16.172
There's a great deal of conflict among them.

22:16.172 --> 22:18.023
They don't trust one another.

22:18.023 --> 22:21.092
Do you know where they're building the weapon?

22:21.092 --> 22:22.680
Not yet.

22:22.680 --> 22:26.142
I'm going to need more time.

22:27.138 --> 22:30.439
What's this?

22:30.439 --> 22:33.578
It helps me extend the range of my telepathy.

22:33.578 --> 22:36.848
My family gave it to me when I was exiled.

22:36.848 --> 22:42.038
Without it, I never would've found you.

22:43.533 --> 22:45.663
Would you like to try?

22:45.663 --> 22:47.532
Is that possible?

22:47.532 --> 22:49.595
With guidance.

23:06.097 --> 23:11.598
If you close your eyes, you'll begin to sense light and color.

23:11.598 --> 23:19.014
Let the images take shape and let the shapes become more distinct.

23:19.014 --> 23:21.267
Can you see them?

23:21.267 --> 23:23.275
I think so.

23:23.275 --> 23:26.720
You're trying too hard to find them.

23:26.720 --> 23:30.233
Let the images come to you.

23:56.391 --> 23:58.137
How do you make sense of all that?

23:58.137 --> 24:00.481
It takes practice.

24:00.481 --> 24:04.363
Try again.

24:04.363 --> 24:06.363
Maybe later.

24:06.363 --> 24:09.158
I should let you get back to your work.

24:11.537 --> 24:16.619
Feel free to return... if you'd like some company.

24:16.619 --> 24:18.341
Thanks.

25:14.296 --> 25:17.100
I asked you to stay inside!

25:17.100 --> 25:19.559
Is this why you didn't want me out here?

25:19.559 --> 25:20.708
Who are they?

25:20.708 --> 25:22.199
They're people I knew.

25:22.199 --> 25:24.789
The last one died over a century ago.

25:24.789 --> 25:25.664
We should go inside.

25:25.664 --> 25:27.496
How did they die?

25:27.496 --> 25:31.523
Very few life spans are as long as mine.

25:31.523 --> 25:32.951
How old are you?

25:32.951 --> 25:36.658
I was born over 400 years ago.

25:36.658 --> 25:38.681
Who were they?

25:38.681 --> 25:42.426
The first one is Morianna Taal.

25:42.426 --> 25:45.409
She was my first companion.

25:45.409 --> 25:50.394
Like you, she had a unique mind.

25:50.394 --> 25:52.292
And the other three?

25:52.292 --> 25:54.517
Companions as well.

25:54.517 --> 25:59.060
When I lost Morianna, I began to search for another...

25:59.060 --> 26:02.205
and another.

26:02.205 --> 26:04.668
Sometimes I don't know what is worse...

26:04.668 --> 26:09.944
being alone, or having to bury the people I've come to care about.

26:09.944 --> 26:13.593
It's been many years since I found someone like you.

26:13.593 --> 26:15.930
You're right, we should go back inside.

26:15.930 --> 26:19.160
All I'm asking is that you consider the possibility.

26:19.160 --> 26:21.499
You know the Enterprise is on an important mission.

26:21.499 --> 26:23.875
I just can't abandon my duties.

26:23.875 --> 26:27.476
It's possible that with my help, your mission will be over soon.

26:27.476 --> 26:29.927
Do you really expect me to spend the rest of my life

26:29.927 --> 26:32.588
on a desolate world,ith someone that I have known

26:32.588 --> 26:34.259
for less than two days?

26:34.259 --> 26:40.080
but over time, they came to appreciate what I had to offer them.

26:40.080 --> 26:44.011
No one will ever understand you the way I can.

26:44.011 --> 26:45.637
I am grateful for your help,

26:45.637 --> 26:47.562
and I'm happy to stay here while you work,

26:47.562 --> 26:52.280
but I have no intention of becoming your next companion.

27:01.401 --> 27:02.827
If you think that projecting yourself

27:02.827 --> 27:06.409
as human is going to make me change my mind, you're mistaken.

27:06.409 --> 27:09.960
You've let your fear of the unknown stand in the way far too many times.

27:09.960 --> 27:12.297
You almost left Enterprise early in its mission

27:12.297 --> 27:14.807
because you didn't think you could control your fears.

27:14.807 --> 27:17.637
But in spite of that, you stayed.

27:17.637 --> 27:19.553
It strengthened you.

27:19.553 --> 27:22.380
This situation is no different.

27:22.380 --> 27:25.434
You obviously misinterpreted a few memories,

27:25.434 --> 27:27.555
because this situation is very different.

27:27.555 --> 27:29.437
I'm giving you the chance to experience something

27:29.437 --> 27:32.066
you searched for your entire life.

27:32.066 --> 27:34.667
It's the reason you study languages...

27:34.667 --> 27:37.272
to make you make connections with people.

27:37.272 --> 27:40.002
I don't need you to help me to do that.

27:40.002 --> 27:43.249
Then why do you seem so isolated?

27:43.249 --> 27:46.406
You live on a ship filled with your own people...

27:46.406 --> 27:50.413
and yet there are many times when you feel alone.

27:50.413 --> 27:52.539
Stay with me.

27:52.539 --> 27:59.819
I'll teach you ways of sharing thoughts and emotions no human can.

27:59.819 --> 28:03.172
I already told you, I'm not interested.

28:03.172 --> 28:05.560
You're lying, Hoshi.

28:05.560 --> 28:08.059
I can hear everything you're thinking.

28:08.059 --> 28:10.700
What I'm thinking is none of your business!

28:10.700 --> 28:15.450
Michio. Your grandfather.

28:15.450 --> 28:18.343
He's the last person you were truly close to,

28:18.343 --> 28:20.448
but he died a long time ago.

28:20.448 --> 28:21.672
Leave me alone.

28:21.672 --> 28:23.806
You can have that kind of connection again.

28:23.806 --> 28:26.015
Leave me alone!

28:27.299 --> 28:32.078
I know this must seem overwhelming.

28:32.078 --> 28:34.430
But think about what I've said.

28:34.430 --> 28:36.796
You're going to have a great deal of time.

28:50.970 --> 28:55.492
Sensors say we're passing through a gravimetric distortion.

29:00.320 --> 29:02.490
No anomalies.

29:02.490 --> 29:06.036
The trellium seems to be doing its job.

29:06.036 --> 29:09.405
- Archer to Enterprise.
- Go ahead.

29:09.405 --> 29:13.964
We're approaching 79,000 kilometers.

29:13.964 --> 29:15.647
Still no sign of the cloaking barrier.

29:15.647 --> 29:19.517
Adjust your heading to 0-1-6-mark-2.

29:19.517 --> 29:21.847
Stand by.

29:29.905 --> 29:32.279
That felt promising.

29:32.279 --> 29:34.080
I believe you just grazed the perimeter.

29:34.080 --> 29:36.984
Turn starboard, 3-point-6 degrees.

29:40.694 --> 29:42.321
I think we've found it!

29:42.321 --> 29:43.658
Maintain course.

29:43.658 --> 29:47.051
You should be heading directly toward the cloaking barrier.

29:48.154 --> 29:51.784
Power's fluctuating.

29:56.689 --> 29:58.205
Hull integrity?

29:58.205 --> 30:01.842
Some micro-fractures, but nothing we can't handle.

30:04.271 --> 30:07.112
Switching to back-up!

30:13.736 --> 30:17.021
Trip.

30:23.081 --> 30:25.121
Let's get going with the scans.

30:29.385 --> 30:31.035
Ah, hell.

30:31.035 --> 30:32.175
Is there a problem?

30:32.175 --> 30:34.968
The sensor relays were damaged.

30:35.479 --> 30:36.963
How much time do you need?

30:36.963 --> 30:39.419
Not long, but we'll have to get back to Enterprise.

30:39.419 --> 30:41.756
I need to open up the circuit housings on the undercarriage.

30:41.756 --> 30:44.173
No way to get to them from the inside.

30:46.711 --> 30:51.433
Bring the descent thrusters on-line.

30:51.433 --> 30:54.060
You're not planning to land on that thing?

30:54.060 --> 30:55.703
Thrusters, Trip.

30:55.703 --> 30:58.306
And get the EV suits ready.

31:13.329 --> 31:16.465
Not exactly my idea of shore leave.

31:16.465 --> 31:18.515
Get to work.

31:18.515 --> 31:20.516
I'm going to take a look around.

31:20.516 --> 31:22.781
Don't get lost.

31:33.849 --> 31:36.662
- How's it coming, Trip?
- Almost there, sir.

31:36.662 --> 31:39.438
Just two more relays.

31:43.048 --> 31:48.571
Captain!

31:52.695 --> 31:53.591
What happened?

31:53.591 --> 31:55.302
The port thruster ignited!

31:55.302 --> 31:56.788
I can see that.

31:56.788 --> 31:58.306
When I was bypassing the last relay,

31:58.306 --> 32:00.768
I must've triggered a surge in the propulsion system.

32:00.768 --> 32:02.793
Son of a bitch!

32:04.739 --> 32:08.848
It's going to be a long time before Enterprise decides to come looking for us.

32:08.848 --> 32:10.622
Can we launch without a port thruster?

32:10.622 --> 32:12.731
We can sure as hell try.

32:15.025 --> 32:17.260
Whoever gets the first clear shot.

32:19.609 --> 32:22.702
Careful, sir. That was awfully close to the O-2 recycler.

32:27.167 --> 32:29.590
I need to spend more time in the Armory.

33:00.407 --> 33:04.234
- Archer to Enterprise.
- We're here, Captain.

33:04.234 --> 33:06.361
It was right where you said it was, T'Pol.

33:06.361 --> 33:08.845
We got all those scans you asked for.

33:10.695 --> 33:12.826
Captain's Starlog, Supplemental.

33:12.826 --> 33:15.505
While T'Pol analyzes the data from the Sphere,

33:15.505 --> 33:17.880
we've set a course to pick up Ensign Sato

33:17.880 --> 33:21.291
and find out if the alien learned anything about the Xindi.

33:28.280 --> 33:29.965
May I come in?

33:29.965 --> 33:31.559
I won't be long.

33:31.559 --> 33:33.587
I just heard from your captain.

33:33.587 --> 33:36.387
Enterprise will be here in a few minutes.

33:36.387 --> 33:39.918
I have learned a great deal about the Xindi weapon.

33:39.918 --> 33:42.888
I'm sure he'll find the information useful.

33:42.888 --> 33:46.454
Thank you for all your help.

33:46.454 --> 33:49.961
Have you given any more thought to my offer?

33:49.961 --> 33:53.363
I can't stay here, you know that.

33:53.363 --> 33:55.799
I understand.

33:55.799 --> 33:59.808
I was foolish to think it was even a possibility.

33:59.808 --> 34:02.916
The next time you invite someone for a visit,

34:02.916 --> 34:07.589
you might want to let them know that you're looking for a lifelong companion.

34:07.589 --> 34:10.338
I won't forget.

34:10.338 --> 34:17.396
Please keep the book as a reminder of your time here.

34:17.396 --> 34:19.190
I was hoping you'd say that.

34:19.190 --> 34:23.436
I'm nearly done, and I'm anxious to see how it ends.

34:23.436 --> 34:27.556
After I've briefed Captain Archer, I'll send him to you.

34:27.556 --> 34:33.085
It was a privilege knowing you.

34:49.130 --> 34:50.580
How was your stay?

34:50.580 --> 34:52.806
I'm eager to get back to Enterprise.

34:52.806 --> 34:54.717
I'm sure.

34:54.717 --> 34:58.969
If it's any consolation, your time here was well spent.

34:58.969 --> 35:02.695
We've learned more about the Xindi than I expected,

35:02.695 --> 35:05.852
and he's offered to keep supplying us with information

35:05.852 --> 35:08.749
for as long as we're in range, thanks to you.

35:08.749 --> 35:11.524
Glad I could help, sir.

35:12.170 --> 35:15.445
There is one condition.

35:15.445 --> 35:19.181
He wants you to stay with him while he continues his work.

35:19.181 --> 35:22.592
I assume you told him that wouldn't be possible.

35:22.592 --> 35:26.715
I won't order you to do this, Hoshi,

35:26.715 --> 35:30.964
but it may be our best chance of finding the weapon before it's too late.

35:30.964 --> 35:37.350
With any luck, it'll only take a few weeks, maybe a month.

35:37.350 --> 35:41.818
We'd come back for you as soon as the mission's over.

35:41.818 --> 35:48.568
I don't need to tell you what's at stake, Ensign.

35:49.476 --> 35:53.268
I'll go back to my quarters to pick up a few things.

35:53.268 --> 35:54.571
Thank you, Hoshi.

35:54.571 --> 35:57.089
There's no reason for you to leave.

35:57.089 --> 36:00.584
Just give me a list of what you need and I'll have it sent down.

36:00.584 --> 36:03.745
I should brief my replacement on the U.T. upgrades.

36:03.745 --> 36:04.912
We'll take care of it.

36:04.912 --> 36:05.664
Don't worry.

36:05.664 --> 36:08.295
At least give me a chance to say good-bye to the crew.

36:08.295 --> 36:09.719
I wish there was time.

36:09.719 --> 36:10.679
It won't take long.

36:10.679 --> 36:13.003
Sir, I might not see my friends again.

36:13.003 --> 36:16.105
I'm sure Travis will understand.

36:16.724 --> 36:17.985
Travis?

36:17.985 --> 36:20.011
Travis and the others.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.648
They realize     how important this is.

36:22.648 --> 36:26.906
I was just thinking about Travis.

36:26.906 --> 36:29.039
You're a regular mind reader.

36:29.039 --> 36:31.895
We've known each other a long time.

36:31.895 --> 36:34.171
Where is Captain Archer?

36:34.171 --> 36:38.338
We'll be here for you... as soon as we can.

36:38.338 --> 36:39.607
Where is he?!

36:39.607 --> 36:40.323
Hoshi...

36:40.323 --> 36:41.949
Where is Captain Archer?!

36:41.949 --> 36:43.452
Hoshi...

36:43.452 --> 36:47.280
Open a channel to Ensign Sato.

36:48.045 --> 36:50.201
Our signal's not getting through, sir.

36:50.201 --> 36:53.750
There's some kind of disruption field.

36:53.750 --> 36:56.651
- Sir...
- What's going on?

36:56.651 --> 36:58.823
My station's down.

36:58.823 --> 37:06.598
Everything's going off-line-- main and auxiliary power, warp engines, life support.

37:09.231 --> 37:10.499
Nice try.

37:10.499 --> 37:13.195
What were you planning to tell my captain when he got back?

37:13.195 --> 37:16.119
Were you going to appear as me, and beg him to let you stay?

37:16.119 --> 37:17.769
No, you can't do that, can you?

37:17.769 --> 37:21.300
I'm the only one on board that you can play your tricks with!

37:21.300 --> 37:24.417
Enterprise has already returned,

37:24.417 --> 37:26.110
and their fate is in your hands.

37:26.110 --> 37:28.041
What is that supposed to mean?

37:28.041 --> 37:30.338
I can't let you leave, Hoshi.

37:30.338 --> 37:32.458
I've waited too long to find you.

37:32.458 --> 37:34.520
What's happened to Enterprise?

37:34.520 --> 37:38.345
If you agree to stay, they won't be harmed.

37:38.345 --> 37:40.502
They'll be free to leave orbit.

37:40.502 --> 37:42.841
Let me speak to Captain Archer.

37:42.841 --> 37:44.100
That's not possible.

37:44.100 --> 37:46.473
Why the hell not?

37:46.473 --> 37:49.467
You'll be happy here, I promise you.

37:49.467 --> 37:52.401
Why can't I speak to Captain Archer?

37:52.401 --> 37:59.627
There's no power on your vessel, and there won't be until you agree to remain with me.

37:59.627 --> 38:03.891
You would kill over 80 people to keep me here?

38:03.891 --> 38:06.539
I don't want to kill anyone.

38:06.539 --> 38:10.803
That's why it's essential that you agree to stay.

38:15.667 --> 38:19.372
You mustn't do that.
It's very fragile.

38:19.372 --> 38:21.553
I'm counting on that.

38:21.553 --> 38:23.952
Now, undo whatever you've done to my ship,

38:23.952 --> 38:26.892
or you will never contact anyone again with this thing!

38:26.892 --> 38:28.487
An empty threat, Hoshi.

38:28.487 --> 38:29.573
As long as you are with me,

38:29.573 --> 38:31.661
I won't need to contact anyone else.

38:31.661 --> 38:35.901
As long as I'm with you, another 60, 70 years? Then what?

38:35.901 --> 38:38.613
What'll you do when I'm grave number five out there?

38:38.613 --> 38:42.210
Without this, you will never find another companion.

38:42.210 --> 38:45.431
You will be alone for the rest of your life.

38:45.431 --> 38:48.505
Please, think of what I can offer you.

38:48.505 --> 38:52.051
This is your last chance!

39:03.590 --> 39:04.804
Report.

39:04.804 --> 39:06.241
Power's returning to all systems.

39:06.241 --> 39:07.326
Malcolm?

39:07.326 --> 39:09.465
Weapons are coming back on-line.

39:09.465 --> 39:12.649
- Tactical alert.
- Aye, sir.

39:12.649 --> 39:15.872
- It's Ensign Sato.
- Put her through.

39:15.872 --> 39:18.775
- Captain, are you all right?
- We are now.

39:18.775 --> 39:20.392
What the hell's going on?

39:20.392 --> 39:23.152
I think it's time to come get me.

39:23.152 --> 39:25.388
Captain's star log, supplement

39:25.388 --> 39:29.929
Ensign Sato's returned to Enterprise without any new information about Xindi

39:29.929 --> 39:34.445
I'm hoping T'Pol's analysis of second Sphere will bring better news

39:34.445 --> 39:36.054
What have you got?

39:36.054 --> 39:40.608
The data you collected allowed me to create a nearly accurate map of the anamolies.

39:40.608 --> 39:41.931
Nearly?

39:41.931 --> 39:46.355
These are the coordinates where we've encountered strong anamolies.

39:46.355 --> 39:48.598
The waves aren't intersecting where they're supposed to.

39:48.598 --> 39:54.396
Exactly. The locations are being influenced by more than two gravimetric sources.

39:54.396 --> 39:55.987
A third Sphere...

39:55.987 --> 39:58.998
A third Sphere would correct some of the error but not all of it.

39:58.998 --> 40:03.423
So I had the computer run a covariant extrapolation.

40:13.622 --> 40:14.963
How many?

40:14.963 --> 40:21.926
We'll need to farther into the Expanse to be certain, but... at least 50.

40:23.256 --> 40:27.938
50 manmade Spheres, each one the size of a small moon.

40:27.938 --> 40:32.350
And each one generating massive amounts of gravimetric energy.

40:32.350 --> 40:37.945
Did it ever occur to you that whoever built these things

40:37.945 --> 40:41.328
may have done it to create the Expanse?

40:41.328 --> 40:47.277
Why would someone want to create a web of crippling anamolies?

40:55.923 --> 40:57.175
What are you doing here?

40:57.175 --> 40:59.043
Did you enjoy the ending?

40:59.043 --> 41:00.541
You can't do this.

41:00.541 --> 41:02.543
I don't want you watching me.

41:02.543 --> 41:06.811
This is the last time. I promise.

41:06.811 --> 41:11.044
I've brought you information to give to your captain.

41:11.044 --> 41:12.421
Why now?

41:12.421 --> 41:14.768
You're on a dangerous mission.

41:14.768 --> 41:17.766
I don't want to see you harmed.

41:17.766 --> 41:23.796
Who knows? You may change your mind about me someday.

41:26.984 --> 41:28.588
Come in.

41:31.010 --> 41:32.624
I thought I told you to get some rest.

41:32.624 --> 41:35.368
He came to my quarters.

41:35.368 --> 41:36.266
I was afraid that might happen.

41:36.266 --> 41:39.549
He gave me these coordinates.

41:39.549 --> 41:40.892
What are they for?

41:40.892 --> 41:42.800
A Xindi colony.

41:42.800 --> 41:46.183
He said they're building part of the weapon there.
