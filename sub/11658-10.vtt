00:56.834 --> 00:59.500
Oh, Sophia.
Your card game run late?

00:59.567 --> 01:02.834
They changed the bus route,
didn't even put up a sign.

01:02.900 --> 01:04.934
That's terrible.
Where did you end up?

01:05.000 --> 01:05.767
Who knows?

01:05.834 --> 01:07.633
I found one person
who spoke English.

01:07.700 --> 01:10.433
He blamed me for
the bay of pigs!

01:10.500 --> 01:11.600
How did you get home?

01:11.667 --> 01:13.133
I took the bus the other way.

01:13.200 --> 01:17.266
That's when I noticed
they changed the bus number.

01:17.333 --> 01:18.734
I'm gonna write David Horowitz.

01:18.800 --> 01:22.567
Sophia,
I think you got on the wrong bus.

01:22.633 --> 01:25.166
Maybe, but I'm writing
David Horowitz anyway.

01:25.233 --> 01:27.400
I want someone to arrest
David Hartman's dentist.

01:28.734 --> 01:33.333
Do you plan to use your
silver bangle bracelet tonight?

01:33.400 --> 01:36.233
I plan to spend the evening
reorganizing my recipe file.

01:36.300 --> 01:39.400
Will you dress for the occasion
or can I borrow the bracelet?

01:40.066 --> 01:41.934
-It's yours.
-Thank you.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.633
Rose, I'm borrowing
your pearl earrings.

01:44.700 --> 01:46.834
What if I'm using them?

01:46.900 --> 01:49.400
Honey, I would be
so happy for you.

01:51.734 --> 01:53.400
But I know you don't have a date.

01:53.467 --> 01:55.033
Actually, the only woman I know

01:55.100 --> 01:58.533
who went without male companionship
longer than you was Heather Swain,

01:58.600 --> 02:00.133
who went to the Sanitarium

02:00.200 --> 02:02.867
for what Reverend Samuels
insisted was the croup.

02:02.934 --> 02:06.834
All Mayflower county knew
it was... a social disease.

02:08.200 --> 02:10.367
Congratulations, Rose.
A new record.

02:10.433 --> 02:13.066
You've done it without needing...
penicillin.

02:14.333 --> 02:16.967
Rose knows I don't mean anything,
don't you?

02:17.033 --> 02:19.000
We all have our dry spells.

02:19.066 --> 02:22.667
You can borrow the earrings.
I'm not going anywhere tonight.

02:22.734 --> 02:25.133
Keep them till I need them.

02:25.200 --> 02:28.100
Don't let this bother you.

02:28.166 --> 02:29.333
You'll date again.

02:29.400 --> 02:30.467
Of course, she will.

02:30.533 --> 02:32.667
Have you thought
about advertising?

02:32.734 --> 02:36.900
Blanche! I could never
dress the way you do.

02:39.800 --> 02:41.967
Besides, I have to wear undies.

02:42.033 --> 02:44.100
Not all my wool skirts are lined.

02:46.133 --> 02:47.767
That's not what I meant.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.734
Do you mean like
a personals column?

02:50.800 --> 02:53.033
-Yes.
-That's a great idea.

02:53.100 --> 02:55.867
-I don't know.
-What do you have to lose?

02:55.934 --> 02:59.834
If you don't find anyone
interesting, you don't reply.

02:59.900 --> 03:04.066
The community center runs their
service in the newsletter free.

03:04.133 --> 03:08.600
They'll even run your picture
and let you use 100 words.

03:08.667 --> 03:10.633
-How do you know?
-Rumor.

03:12.100 --> 03:14.166
I suppose I could try it,

03:14.233 --> 03:18.033
but I could never see myself going
out with a man I met that way.

03:18.100 --> 03:21.500
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

03:21.567 --> 03:25.467
I'm not the only woman
in Miami without a date.

03:25.533 --> 03:28.500
Rose, I need to borrow
a silk scarf tonight.

03:29.967 --> 03:31.166
You have a date?

03:31.233 --> 03:34.300
No. I'm dancing the Seven Veils,
and I'm one short.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.667
Sometimes
I worry about her.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.333
Girls, was this
the only mail today?

03:48.400 --> 03:50.934
Can you believe "people" magazine
is late again?

03:51.000 --> 03:53.433
I'll give that mailman
another talking to.

03:53.500 --> 03:57.166
Try something more forceful
than asking him in

03:57.233 --> 03:59.834
for a cafe Vienna
and a warm bath.

04:01.567 --> 04:04.467
The man had just recovered
from a hernia operation.

04:04.533 --> 04:06.834
He was having trouble carrying
his sack.

04:15.400 --> 04:18.667
I can't believe the response
to my personal ad is terrible.

04:18.734 --> 04:19.700
No one interested?

04:19.767 --> 04:20.633
No one, period.

04:20.700 --> 04:22.500
Two weeks,
not one letter.

04:23.567 --> 04:24.467
Hi Sophia.

04:24.533 --> 04:27.834
I don't want to turn around. Do
anyone see a fedora in the window?

04:28.333 --> 04:29.333
I don't.

04:29.400 --> 04:30.533
Good. I lost him.

04:30.600 --> 04:31.800
Lost him?
Lost who?

04:31.867 --> 04:34.133
This guy keeps following me.

04:34.200 --> 04:37.033
Apparently he's English.
We met at the center.

04:37.100 --> 04:38.233
He's got the hots for me...

04:39.567 --> 04:41.567
as much as an English guy
can get the hots.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.734
Sophia has men chasing her.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.533
I can't even get a letter.

04:47.600 --> 04:48.900
You want Willie, you got him.

04:48.967 --> 04:50.266
What's wrong with him?

04:50.333 --> 04:53.633
Nothing. Ok, so he's 90.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.333
He has the profile
of a Tom Turkey,

04:57.400 --> 04:59.166
and his butt hits his heels
when he walks.

05:00.767 --> 05:05.000
He thinks he pulls it off
with an ascot and a cap.

05:05.500 --> 05:08.967
He sounds cute, Ma.
Why are you avoiding him?

05:09.033 --> 05:12.266
There's no magic, no sparks.
You know what I mean?

05:12.333 --> 05:15.300
He's 90, you're 80.
Sparks are dangerous.

05:17.133 --> 05:20.900
I'd never date a man
unless I felt those sparks.

05:20.967 --> 05:23.834
Fortunately,
you carry flints in your bra.

05:26.900 --> 05:31.133
I can't believe I'm listening to a
discussion about Sophia's love life.

05:31.200 --> 05:34.200
Let me fix you up with willie.
He needs to forget me.

05:34.266 --> 05:35.633
No, thank you.

05:35.700 --> 05:37.400
Ok, but you don't know
what you're missing.

05:37.467 --> 05:39.834
There aren't many guys
who remember where they were

05:39.900 --> 05:42.300
when the Archduke Ferdinand
was shot.

05:44.934 --> 05:48.633
Rose, don't let this
personals thing depress you.

05:48.700 --> 05:50.900
I can't help it. I haven't
been this depressed

05:50.967 --> 05:53.166
since I was rejected
by uncle Sam.

05:54.033 --> 05:57.467
Honey, if he was your uncle,
it wasn't meant to be.

06:02.967 --> 06:06.700
It's not like
he was your cousin,

06:06.767 --> 06:08.767
where the relationship
might've had a future.

06:09.266 --> 06:13.066
Did any of your relatives
appear in "deliverance"?

06:15.400 --> 06:17.600
It was during
the Korean conflict.

06:17.667 --> 06:21.867
I was rejected as a W.A.C.
I failed the inkblot test.

06:21.934 --> 06:24.934
How can you fail
an inkblot test?

06:25.000 --> 06:27.734
I didn't know you weren't
supposed to cut them out.

06:28.934 --> 06:33.000
I never felt so rejected
in my life... until now.

06:35.533 --> 06:38.433
This personals idea was a mistake.

06:38.500 --> 06:39.800
Can't we do anything?

06:39.867 --> 06:41.934
We've done quite enough.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.667
I'm gonna set her up
with Henry Barnes.

06:46.734 --> 06:50.033
He's reasonably good-looking,
drives a new Buick,

06:50.100 --> 06:53.767
and I heard he opened
a third dry-cleaning store.

06:53.834 --> 06:54.834
Where you going?

06:54.900 --> 06:57.133
I'm calling Henry.
I'm free tonight.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.734
-What about Rose?
-Call Bud Needham.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.333
Who's Bud Needham?

07:01.400 --> 07:03.867
He's taking Henry's place
in my discard pile.

07:10.433 --> 07:13.800
Tell Jackie you'd prefer
Marla to do your hair.

07:13.867 --> 07:17.800
Jackie and I go way back,
before bouffant.

07:17.867 --> 07:20.767
-You're practically family.
-I know.

07:20.834 --> 07:23.467
I'll switch to Marla,
you take Jackie.

07:23.533 --> 07:26.066
You said Jackie makes you
look like a chicken.

07:26.133 --> 07:28.533
With your nose,
you could pull it off.

07:31.633 --> 07:34.300
Girls, guess what happened.

07:34.367 --> 07:36.867
I got a response
from my personal ad.

07:36.934 --> 07:38.233
-You're kidding.
-That's great!

07:38.300 --> 07:40.734
And it's just the sweetest letter.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.533
He apologizes for waiting
so long to respond.

07:43.600 --> 07:46.700
He says he's shy about
meeting someone this way.

07:46.767 --> 07:49.233
He and I have so much in common.

07:49.300 --> 07:51.900
We both love dairy foods.

07:51.967 --> 07:54.533
We both requested
to stand next to Bert parks

07:54.600 --> 07:56.367
in "hands across America."

07:56.433 --> 08:00.266
-He sounds very nice.
-Are you going out with him?

08:00.333 --> 08:01.533
I couldn't.

08:01.600 --> 08:05.900
That was just an experiment, but
the letter's too sweet to ignore.

08:05.967 --> 08:08.633
I'll write him back
and tell him I appreciate it.

08:10.433 --> 08:13.867
It's nice to see Rose feeling good
about herself.

08:13.934 --> 08:18.300
This is the first time she's smiled
since this whole thing started.

08:19.834 --> 08:23.000
Dorothy,
I have a confession to make.

08:23.700 --> 08:25.633
I wrote that letter to Rose.

08:27.567 --> 08:30.066
-You what?
-I wrote it myself.

08:30.133 --> 08:33.133
I made up a name
and answered Rose's ad.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.700
Blanche, how could you?

08:35.767 --> 08:38.533
She thinks someone took
an interest in her.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.800
Well, someone did, me.

08:40.867 --> 08:43.300
What if she expects
another letter?

08:43.367 --> 08:45.367
What if she decides to date him?

08:45.433 --> 08:50.000
We write a farewell letter
before he moves to Saskatchewan,

08:50.066 --> 08:51.967
and that's the end of Isaac Newton.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.500
Isaac newton?

08:56.567 --> 08:58.700
It was the first name
that came to mind.

08:59.300 --> 09:02.500
Isaac newton was the first name
that came to mind?

09:03.767 --> 09:07.433
Ted Koppel was the first
that came to mind,

09:07.500 --> 09:10.367
but he looks like howdy doody's
illegitimate son.

09:13.433 --> 09:14.767
Gin!

09:20.734 --> 09:23.600
-He could end it with a poem.
-He did that last time.

09:23.667 --> 09:26.333
It's been several letters
since he wrote one.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.734
He doesn't write poems, we do.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.734
Actually, Lord Byron writes poems.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.934
We just copy them
onto loose-leaf paper.

09:35.367 --> 09:38.266
In cleverly disguised
handwriting, I might add.

09:38.333 --> 09:40.367
Why was I talked into this?

09:40.433 --> 09:41.900
It's out of control.

09:41.967 --> 09:43.667
We have to tell Rose the truth.

09:43.734 --> 09:45.266
It would crush her.

09:45.333 --> 09:48.033
Then it's time to ship
Isaac Newton to Saskatchewan.

09:48.533 --> 09:51.734
You can't send a citrus farmer
to Saskatchewan.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.567
How will he make a living?

09:54.734 --> 09:57.300
Excuse me.
Next time we invent someone,

09:57.367 --> 10:00.100
let's give him a trade that travels.

10:00.700 --> 10:05.333
I'm proud of the job we've done.
I hate to see him go.

10:05.400 --> 10:09.633
We've created a poetry-writing
citrus farmer

10:09.700 --> 10:12.266
who writes with a lavender pen.

10:13.600 --> 10:17.767
Rose thinks he's fascinating.
What does that say?

10:17.834 --> 10:20.066
-About Rose?
-About all of us.

10:21.033 --> 10:23.333
Dorothy, I got a big problem.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.400
The Metamucil's in the top cabinet.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.967
I'm talking about
the Cheswick dude.

10:29.033 --> 10:31.567
I sat him down
and explained that at 90,

10:31.633 --> 10:34.400
there would never
be anything between us.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.333
What did he say?

10:35.400 --> 10:39.700
He said, "not never, but with luck,
every six or seven weeks."

10:41.433 --> 10:43.300
I'm glad everybody's still up.

10:43.367 --> 10:45.333
I just had a terrific idea.

10:45.400 --> 10:46.400
What's that?

10:46.467 --> 10:49.133
I've been reading and
rereading Isaac's letters.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.967
I've decided to tell him
I want to meet him.

10:55.900 --> 10:58.100
But... you said you wouldn't.

10:58.166 --> 11:02.066
I never believed
I'd find such a special man.

11:02.133 --> 11:04.233
What makes you think
he's special?

11:04.300 --> 11:06.500
I mean,
you hardly know him.

11:11.633 --> 11:12.867
I suppose,

11:12.934 --> 11:15.667
but it feels like
I've known him for ages

11:15.734 --> 11:17.700
and that he's known me.

11:17.767 --> 11:20.133
I've found the world's
most wonderful man.

11:20.200 --> 11:22.066
I owe it all to the two of you.

11:25.700 --> 11:28.266
How do you spell Saskatchewan?

11:33.133 --> 11:35.233
Have you seen my dress watch?

11:35.300 --> 11:36.567
It's on my wrist.

11:36.633 --> 11:39.200
I need it.
Can't you ask?

11:39.266 --> 11:40.367
I didn't want to disturb you.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.567
You were having trouble
taming your cowlick.

11:44.100 --> 11:47.367
It's silly to take three cars.

11:47.433 --> 11:49.200
Four couples can fit into two.

11:49.266 --> 11:51.767
Fine. Howard won't mind.

11:51.834 --> 11:53.667
Ma, you and your date
can ride with us.

11:53.734 --> 11:57.100
Willie scared off all the eligible
men at the center.

11:57.867 --> 11:59.667
Can I borrow my earrings?

11:59.734 --> 12:02.467
You and your cousin
can ride with us.

12:02.533 --> 12:03.767
I'm not taking Arnold.

12:03.834 --> 12:06.133
But he's always your old standby.

12:06.200 --> 12:07.734
I'm dateless too.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.633
We can hang out together
and guess people's weight.

12:11.467 --> 12:13.133
I have a date, Sophia.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.667
It's just not cousin Arnold.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.567
Good. I never liked your cousin.

12:17.734 --> 12:20.467
So you have a date.
Anyone we know?

12:20.533 --> 12:21.767
Isaac.

12:22.266 --> 12:23.367
Excuse me?

12:23.433 --> 12:25.266
Isaac, from the personals.

12:25.767 --> 12:27.967
You're not serious?

12:28.033 --> 12:29.200
Sure, I am.

12:29.266 --> 12:32.367
Before I could write
and suggest we meet,

12:32.433 --> 12:36.600
I got a letter from him saying he's
being transferred to Saskatchewan.

12:36.667 --> 12:39.233
He's going to be
the smudge pot supervisor

12:39.300 --> 12:41.700
of the first Domed Orange Grove
in Canada.

12:44.767 --> 12:48.600
Anyway, he's leaving Tuesday,
so there was no time to waste.

12:48.667 --> 12:50.200
I told you we shouldn't
have done this.

12:50.266 --> 12:51.834
I looked through
all the phone books.

12:51.900 --> 12:55.700
Would you believe there was only
one listing for Isaac Q. Newton?

12:56.867 --> 12:59.100
I called him up and invited him
to the reception.

13:01.667 --> 13:03.734
He should be here any minute.

13:16.934 --> 13:20.367
Are you telling us that you got
your date from the phone book?

13:20.433 --> 13:22.967
You make it sound
like the yellow pages.

13:23.033 --> 13:24.800
It's not like I don't know him.

13:24.867 --> 13:29.734
Rose, exactly what did he say
when you called him?

13:29.800 --> 13:32.400
I was pretty nervous and excited.

13:32.467 --> 13:34.734
I didn't give him much chance
to say anything.

13:34.800 --> 13:36.967
But he accepted your invitation?

13:37.033 --> 13:38.934
I told him I wouldn't take no
for an answer.

13:40.967 --> 13:43.333
I better finish getting ready.

13:43.400 --> 13:46.000
Is it ok to borrow
my beaded purse?

13:46.066 --> 13:47.900
-Sure, honey.
-Thanks.

13:50.266 --> 13:51.800
What are we going to do?

13:52.934 --> 13:55.233
We can't let Rose
go out with a guy

13:55.300 --> 13:59.000
who said yes to a date
from the phone book.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.767
You say that like
nobody ever does it.

14:06.300 --> 14:08.800
Besides, it's just for one date.

14:08.867 --> 14:10.700
Day after tomorrow,
he leaves for Saskatchewan.

14:10.767 --> 14:13.333
He doesn't leave for anywhere.
We made that up.

14:13.400 --> 14:17.600
Oh, right!
What if he's wonderful?

14:17.667 --> 14:19.767
We would've ruined
her evening for nothing.

14:19.834 --> 14:21.700
-(doorbell rings)
-Let's meet him.

14:21.767 --> 14:24.300
Maybe he's Rose's dream come true.

14:25.667 --> 14:27.533
Well, so much for that theory.

14:29.066 --> 14:32.934
Good evening.
Wilfred Whitney Cheswick here.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.166
Might this be the home
of the widow Petrillo?

14:37.166 --> 14:39.433
Well, there you are, Sophia.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.433
Willie, what the hell are you doing?

14:41.500 --> 14:44.467
I've come to escort you
to the reception,

14:44.533 --> 14:46.800
and I won't take no
for an answer.

14:46.867 --> 14:48.800
Oh, yeah?
Take this for an answer.

14:50.967 --> 14:51.934
Ma!

14:52.433 --> 14:53.967
All right, Cheswick.

14:54.033 --> 14:56.600
Since you rented a monkey suit,
you'll get your money's worth.

14:56.667 --> 14:58.767
But if anybody cute
asks me to dance,

14:58.834 --> 15:00.367
make yourself scarce.

15:00.433 --> 15:04.734
Once I you have in my arms
on that dance floor,

15:04.800 --> 15:07.900
you won't so much
as glance at another man.

15:07.967 --> 15:09.633
Dream on, Piccadilly.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.467
Come on, Blanche.

15:13.533 --> 15:16.967
Let's go confess to Rose
and beg her forgiveness.

15:17.033 --> 15:18.967
(doorbell rings)

15:26.000 --> 15:28.166
-Hi. Rose?
-No, I'm Dorothy.

15:29.033 --> 15:29.934
Hi. Rose?

15:30.000 --> 15:32.266
I'm Blanche.
You must be Isaac Newton.

15:32.333 --> 15:33.767
Yes, I am.

15:33.834 --> 15:36.934
I bet you take a lot of kidding
about that.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
About what?

15:41.934 --> 15:45.166
Rose should be ready soon.
Make yourself comfortable.

15:45.233 --> 15:46.633
Oh, no. I couldn't.

15:46.700 --> 15:47.934
I'm never comfortable.

15:48.867 --> 15:50.934
You wouldn't know it,

15:51.000 --> 15:52.934
but I've nearly sweated
through this suit.

15:54.533 --> 15:58.400
I guess Rose forgot to mention
tonight's reception is black tie.

15:58.467 --> 16:00.166
I have it in my pocket.

16:05.266 --> 16:07.133
I'll bet you were surprised

16:07.200 --> 16:10.633
when Rose called you up
and invited you out.

16:10.700 --> 16:14.200
Yes. I don't date very much.

16:14.266 --> 16:15.834
I mean, I try.

16:15.900 --> 16:17.367
I took a lot of good-natured ribbing

16:17.433 --> 16:19.367
before I left the boarding
house this evening.

16:20.567 --> 16:22.667
Hi. I'm ready.

16:22.734 --> 16:25.033
Rose, this is Isaac.

16:25.100 --> 16:26.734
Wow!

16:26.800 --> 16:28.300
You're really beautiful.

16:28.367 --> 16:29.467
Thank you, Isaac.

16:29.533 --> 16:33.667
-We have to talk to you right now.
-That's a very nice dress.

16:33.734 --> 16:34.734
Thank you.

16:34.800 --> 16:38.200
I've worn it once before,
but the pantyhose are new.

16:39.834 --> 16:45.100
If we could see you on the lanai
for just a few moments--

16:45.166 --> 16:49.166
If I may be so bold,
the pantyhose are nice too,

16:49.233 --> 16:50.700
at least the hose part.

16:52.033 --> 16:55.300
I'm very happy to finally meet
you, Isaac.

16:55.367 --> 16:58.300
You two run along.
We'll catch up later.

16:58.367 --> 17:00.767
-Blanche.
-Something's happening here.

17:00.834 --> 17:03.333
Yes.
It's the beginning of a disaster.

17:03.400 --> 17:06.000
Everything could turn out fine.

17:06.066 --> 17:08.100
Can I get you something?

17:08.166 --> 17:10.567
Coffee, tea, a dairy product?

17:10.633 --> 17:14.033
Cheese would be nice.
Tends to calm my nerves.

17:17.266 --> 17:20.533
Thank you, sweet Jesus,
it's a miracle.

17:27.400 --> 17:29.734
Could you get me
another champagne?

17:29.800 --> 17:31.033
Me too.

17:31.533 --> 17:32.834
I haven't seen them anywhere.

17:32.900 --> 17:37.333
What if he's some depraved
ex-convict who's kidnapped Rose

17:37.400 --> 17:39.033
and is dragging her
across seven states

17:39.100 --> 17:43.467
on a rampage of violence
and destruction?

17:44.667 --> 17:47.333
Then we probably should have
told her about the letters.

17:48.033 --> 17:49.100
I think you're right.

17:49.166 --> 17:50.967
Come on. Let's find them.

17:52.233 --> 17:56.934
Being vice principal of a junior
high school isn't so glamorous.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.300
I do store the chocolate
clusters in my garage

18:00.367 --> 18:02.400
from the band uniform drive,

18:02.467 --> 18:05.533
and I am the advisor
to the French club,

18:05.600 --> 18:09.767
but for 15 years,
I've been asking, "is that enough?"

18:09.834 --> 18:13.400
About a week ago,
I answered myself with a big fat no.

18:13.467 --> 18:15.333
Good for you, Isaac.

18:15.400 --> 18:18.367
It takes a special man
to talk to himself like that.

18:18.433 --> 18:22.233
Well, <i>merci</i>.
That's French for thank you.

18:24.033 --> 18:29.133
Anyway, I decided it's about time
I fulfilled my lifelong dream

18:29.200 --> 18:32.567
to join those daring men
who soar above the earth.

18:32.633 --> 18:34.133
You want to be an astronaut?

18:34.200 --> 18:37.000
No. I don't like going
to the bathroom in my suit.

18:38.567 --> 18:40.266
I want to be a traffic reporter.

18:40.333 --> 18:43.300
I want the name Isaac newton
to be remembered.

18:45.166 --> 18:46.600
You're remarkable, Isaac.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.934
All this and citrus farming too.

18:50.266 --> 18:51.567
Hello there.

18:51.633 --> 18:54.700
-Isn't it a wonderful party?
-Glorious.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.166
You two having a good time?

18:56.233 --> 18:59.133
I only regret
I didn't call Isaac sooner.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.734
That would've been hard.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.667
Mom didn't allow me
my own phone till last year.

19:04.166 --> 19:08.166
Don't be too tough on her.
Look how great you turned out.

19:08.233 --> 19:09.767
<i>Merci.</i>

19:09.834 --> 19:11.734
Would you get us some champagne?

19:11.800 --> 19:15.367
Is that in the bottle or the bowl?

19:15.433 --> 19:17.567
Oh, never mind. I'll figure it out.

19:17.633 --> 19:19.467
We have to talk.

19:19.533 --> 19:23.166
Isaac's the shyest man
I've ever met.

19:23.233 --> 19:26.166
He won't even discuss anything
about his letters.

19:26.233 --> 19:27.500
-Rose--
-Listen--

19:27.567 --> 19:31.333
I shouldn't push it. If he wants
to hide his romantic side

19:31.400 --> 19:34.133
because it embarrasses him,
that's fine,

19:34.200 --> 19:38.266
but he won't explain
how a smudge pot works.

19:38.333 --> 19:39.166
Look, Rose--

19:39.233 --> 19:42.367
Here we are, ladies.
Two champagnes.

19:42.433 --> 19:45.033
There's dancing in the garden.

19:45.100 --> 19:47.066
I know you love dancing.

19:47.133 --> 19:48.467
I do?

19:48.533 --> 19:52.066
-Well, then let's have at it.
-See?

19:52.133 --> 19:55.400
-Listen, Rose--
-We'll be back soon.

19:55.467 --> 19:58.133
You can't get rid of me, Sophia.

19:58.200 --> 20:01.233
I won't give up until you're mine.

20:01.300 --> 20:02.567
Here, hold this.

20:06.667 --> 20:08.300
I know what you're thinking,

20:08.367 --> 20:14.367
that I'm only after your money,
but I love you very much.

20:14.433 --> 20:19.266
The fact that you're a wealthy widow
only makes me want to protect you,

20:19.333 --> 20:21.433
not take advantage of you.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.200
Whoa, Willie.

20:23.266 --> 20:25.133
You got your brains in your ascot?

20:26.033 --> 20:28.000
Where'd you get the idea
that I'm wealthy?

20:28.066 --> 20:29.867
Jerry Giordano.

20:29.934 --> 20:31.967
I told him that
so he'd take me to bingo.

20:32.033 --> 20:33.767
You aren't wealthy?

20:33.834 --> 20:36.600
I can't even keep
a minimum checking balance.

20:36.667 --> 20:39.166
My regards to your lovely family.

20:42.033 --> 20:45.200
Why are you upset?
I told you I couldn't dance.

20:45.266 --> 20:48.266
Your letters said
you loved to dance.

20:48.333 --> 20:50.100
What's this letter
you keep mentioning?

20:50.166 --> 20:52.567
I'm not talking
about one letter.

20:52.633 --> 20:53.934
I'm talking about
all the letters.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.100
The alphabet?

20:55.166 --> 20:57.500
You didn't mean any of it,
did you?

20:57.567 --> 21:00.266
This was all a weird joke.

21:00.333 --> 21:01.767
Oh, no. I swear.

21:01.834 --> 21:03.333
I have no sense of humor.

21:04.467 --> 21:06.200
Rose, listen to us.

21:06.266 --> 21:09.367
Rose, we're the ones
who wrote those letters.

21:11.100 --> 21:11.934
What?

21:12.000 --> 21:13.767
We were just trying
to cheer you up.

21:13.834 --> 21:19.033
We couldn't find
the right moment to tell you.

21:21.967 --> 21:24.467
Oh.

21:26.300 --> 21:28.233
I'm glad you straightened that out.

21:28.300 --> 21:30.934
I was beginning to remember
writing those letters.

21:43.567 --> 21:46.200
I know I saw her come in. Rose.

21:47.567 --> 21:50.500
Rose.
Honey, are you in there?

21:50.567 --> 21:54.000
Rose, please come out and talk.

21:54.066 --> 21:57.066
Go away.
I don't want to talk.

21:57.133 --> 22:00.367
You have every right
to be angry.

22:00.433 --> 22:05.867
What we did was inexcusable,
but at least let us explain why.

22:05.934 --> 22:07.400
No. Leave me alone.

22:07.467 --> 22:08.934
It'll be a second.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.500
We're not leaving until we talk,
if it takes all night.

22:13.900 --> 22:17.133
How could you do this to me?
I thought you were my friends.

22:17.200 --> 22:18.867
We are, Rose.

22:18.934 --> 22:21.767
What we did was out of friendship.

22:21.834 --> 22:23.066
Friendship?

22:23.133 --> 22:24.834
I looked like a fool.

22:25.333 --> 22:27.900
I wondered where
they moved the party to.

22:28.667 --> 22:30.600
This is the ladies' room!

22:30.667 --> 22:32.834
It's where ladies
go to the bathroom.

22:32.900 --> 22:35.500
Wow!
How do you lift this baby up?

22:38.100 --> 22:39.734
Isaac, later, later.

22:39.800 --> 22:42.333
I guess you have to stand back
when you flush this.

22:44.433 --> 22:47.333
Oh, Rose, honey,
please come out.

22:47.400 --> 22:50.200
We've already told you
how sorry we are.

22:50.266 --> 22:53.500
We never expected this to go so far.

22:53.567 --> 22:56.066
But that wasn't
even the worst part.

22:56.133 --> 22:58.367
The worst part
was making me believe

22:58.433 --> 23:01.533
that somebody felt
those things about me.

23:02.033 --> 23:05.633
Somebody wanted to hear
why I hate my job

23:05.700 --> 23:08.333
or like to eat my lunch in the park.

23:08.967 --> 23:10.767
It was so nice.

23:10.834 --> 23:13.900
It was so important
that someone simply cared

23:13.967 --> 23:17.033
as much as the person
who wrote those letters.

23:17.967 --> 23:21.533
It meant so much
to have somebody like that.

23:21.600 --> 23:24.567
You do, Rose.
You have us.

23:24.633 --> 23:26.233
We're the ones
who wrote those letters,

23:26.300 --> 23:28.467
and we meant every word.

23:40.266 --> 23:42.633
Oh, Rose.

23:45.100 --> 23:47.467
It was still a crazy thing to do.

23:47.533 --> 23:50.967
It's nice to know
it's because you cared.

23:52.567 --> 23:55.367
Let's get back to our dates.

23:55.433 --> 23:58.300
I want Howard to get me tipsy
and take advantage.

23:58.367 --> 23:59.467
Blanche.

24:00.400 --> 24:01.767
Howard's my date.

24:03.367 --> 24:04.300
Oops.

24:13.333 --> 24:17.567
(theme music playing)
