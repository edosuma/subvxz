WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:04.438
Previously on Limitless...
I work for the FBI.

00:04.472 --> 00:07.175
You were placed in the FBI.

00:07.208 --> 00:09.810
You belong to Mr. Morra
now, which means

00:09.843 --> 00:11.645
you belong to me.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.314
Brian's sister
is really cute.

00:14.482 --> 00:16.184
I've been thinking about
asking her out.

00:16.217 --> 00:18.119
Before you went to work
for Senator Morra,

00:18.152 --> 00:19.253
you were MI6.

00:19.287 --> 00:22.590
How much did Morra pay
to take you away from the SIS?

00:22.623 --> 00:25.159
If Senator Morra
is using NZT,

00:25.193 --> 00:27.128
if he is connected to the purges
that wiped the pills

00:27.161 --> 00:29.663
off the streets two years ago,
it's gonna take more

00:29.697 --> 00:32.266
than a buyout
to keep me from the truth.

00:35.136 --> 00:38.139
*

00:38.172 --> 00:41.142
BRIAN: I had all the ingredients
for a relaxing night at home:

00:41.175 --> 00:42.776
three unwatched episodes
of a certain fantasy epic...

00:42.810 --> 00:44.445
(swords clanging,
men shouting)

00:44.478 --> 00:47.315
...Thai food, Sinbad,

00:47.348 --> 00:49.117
and my sister,
who loves the show,

00:49.150 --> 00:51.452
but has a hard time keeping up
when Sinbad's involved.

00:51.485 --> 00:54.188
So, if the bearded guy
with the cool sword kills

00:54.222 --> 00:55.489
all the ice zombies,

00:55.523 --> 00:59.193
he still has to fight the other
bearded guy with the cool sword,

00:59.227 --> 01:00.661
right?

01:00.694 --> 01:04.198
You know what, I'm still focused
on the way that guy's head

01:04.232 --> 01:06.267
just went...
(squishing sound)

01:06.300 --> 01:08.102
(both chuckle)

01:08.136 --> 01:10.704
Reminded me of how
my last date ended.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.406
(laughs):
Ew. What?

01:12.440 --> 01:14.208
Something you want
to talk about?

01:14.242 --> 01:17.178
Mm-mm. That's what I
have girlfriends for.

01:17.211 --> 01:20.214
Oh, my God.
Stop that. Stop it.

01:20.248 --> 01:22.816
But in this age of
"Netflix and chill,"

01:22.850 --> 01:25.286
it is no time to be looking
for someone decent.

01:25.319 --> 01:26.720
(knocking on door)

01:30.358 --> 01:32.360
(knocking continues)

01:35.196 --> 01:37.165
Oh, God.

01:37.198 --> 01:38.166
(groans)

01:38.199 --> 01:39.767
Sands!
(groaning)

01:42.303 --> 01:44.238
Uh, Rach,

01:44.272 --> 01:45.306
this is
a colleague of mine.

01:45.339 --> 01:47.308
My, uh,
racquetball partner.

01:47.341 --> 01:48.809
Whoa! Aah!
I know! I know!

01:48.842 --> 01:50.811
Your racquetball partner
is bleeding!

01:50.844 --> 01:52.413
Oh, dear!
All right.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.248
Sit tight. I'm gonna call 911.
SANDS: No.

01:54.282 --> 01:56.517
What? You don't want me
to call 911?
No.

01:56.550 --> 01:57.785
All right, then I'll call
our mutual friend.

01:57.818 --> 01:58.886
He's got nurses
and stuff.

01:58.919 --> 02:00.254
What?
No.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.291
I know you've got
extra pills here.

02:03.324 --> 02:05.493
Use one and fix this.

02:07.728 --> 02:08.662
(groans)

02:08.696 --> 02:11.332
Uh, Rach, I got

02:11.365 --> 02:13.234
some kind of weird news.

02:13.267 --> 02:16.570
Uh, looks like
we're gonna have to operate.

02:16.604 --> 02:17.738
Operate? He
needs a hospital!

02:17.771 --> 02:19.373
No!
Yeah, well,
that's not an option,

02:19.407 --> 02:20.341
apparently.

02:20.374 --> 02:22.376
Well, neither
is operating.

02:22.410 --> 02:23.877
Why are you getting out
your records?

02:23.911 --> 02:26.680
(grunts loudly)
Just... forget it, okay?

02:26.714 --> 02:29.350
The important thing for you
to know is I don't...

02:29.383 --> 02:31.352
the racquetball with him. He's..

02:31.385 --> 02:32.520
(groans)

02:32.553 --> 02:34.722
...an undercover agent.

02:34.755 --> 02:36.224
Can't you get FBI doctors?

02:36.257 --> 02:37.958
No, no, I can't,
because he's in too deep.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.294
They can't know he's part
of the Bureau. All right?

02:40.328 --> 02:41.962
You and me are
the only way to help him.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.698
But the good news is
that I do have a certain level

02:44.732 --> 02:46.867
of FBI medical training.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.102
Okay, that's a white lie.

02:49.136 --> 02:51.439
But I did read my brother's
medical school books

02:51.472 --> 02:54.375
when I was trying to figure out
why my dad was sick.

02:58.946 --> 03:02.250
If you give me a hand with this,
it'll be okay.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.519
(groans, panting)

03:05.553 --> 03:07.788
Okay. So...

03:07.821 --> 03:09.490
there's a piece of glass stuck
in his great saphenous vein.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.359
RACHEL: How do you know
what a great saphenous vein is?

03:11.392 --> 03:13.427
BRIAN:
We have to get the glass out,
but we need to be super careful,

03:13.461 --> 03:14.895
'cause his femoral artery
is right there.
Mm-hmm.

03:14.928 --> 03:16.364
BRIAN: We need to sew the vein
back together,

03:16.397 --> 03:18.399
all right, and
close the wound.
(whimpering)

03:18.432 --> 03:21.001
Oh, shoot. I don't
have a sewing kit.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.836
Oh, you know what, blue
building across the street,

03:22.870 --> 03:24.905
apartment 3A, there's a girl
named Kayleigh who lives there

03:24.938 --> 03:26.974
and she knits. Go ask
to borrow her stuff.

03:27.007 --> 03:29.310
What, am I supposed to just go
over there and introduce myself?

03:29.343 --> 03:30.244
Bring her the pizza cutter
that I borrowed from her.

03:30.278 --> 03:32.746
That way she knows
you're legit. All right?

03:32.780 --> 03:34.548
Rach, it's either that...
(Sands shouts)

03:34.582 --> 03:35.683
(screams)

03:35.716 --> 03:37.818
...or apply pressure
to the wound.

03:37.851 --> 03:40.854
What are you doing here?
(door opens, closes)

03:43.891 --> 03:46.560
"Wilder, DeMille,
Lean, Huston..."

03:47.795 --> 03:49.497
RACHEL:
Hi.

03:51.632 --> 03:54.034
BRIAN:
Good. Just put your finger

03:54.067 --> 03:55.303
right there.
Huh?

03:55.336 --> 03:57.571
Put your finger right there.
(groans)

03:57.605 --> 03:58.572
(Sands gasps)

03:58.606 --> 04:01.909
All right.
Wow. That is...

04:01.942 --> 04:03.777
graphic.
Uh-huh.

04:03.811 --> 04:06.580
Let go.
Okay. Okay.

04:06.614 --> 04:09.049
All right.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.385
Pretty tidy stitch job.

04:11.419 --> 04:13.321
(groans)
RACHEL: The FBI
teach you that?

04:13.354 --> 04:15.389
Yes, they did.

04:15.423 --> 04:17.325
And now my friend is gonna
go back into the night

04:17.358 --> 04:19.593
to complete
his top secret assignment.

04:19.627 --> 04:22.496
We'll never speak
of this again.

04:22.530 --> 04:23.531
You all right?

04:24.365 --> 04:26.400
(gasping)

04:27.468 --> 04:28.602
Uh...

04:28.636 --> 04:29.670
Is he breathing?

04:29.703 --> 04:31.004
(inhales sharply)

04:32.072 --> 04:33.674
Well, it's
like he's...

04:33.707 --> 04:35.343
inhaling but...

04:35.376 --> 04:37.345
he can't breathe out.

04:37.378 --> 04:38.679
Wait, wait. I saw this
on one of my shows.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.681
If he gets hit hard
in the chest,

04:40.714 --> 04:42.683
his breathing gets blocked.
It's called tension....

04:42.716 --> 04:44.952
tension...

04:44.985 --> 04:46.820
Tension pneumothorax.

04:46.854 --> 04:48.456
That's good.

04:48.489 --> 04:48.956
It's good?

04:50.558 --> 04:52.693
Yeah. 'Cause
we can fix it.

04:52.726 --> 04:55.696
See, his trachea
is crushing his lungs.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.431
Must've just shifted
from the fight.

04:57.465 --> 04:58.999
So the air gets
trapped in there.

04:59.032 --> 05:00.634
So as soon as
we, you know,

05:00.668 --> 05:02.336
poke a hole in one of them...

05:02.370 --> 05:03.571
But...

05:03.604 --> 05:06.340
we got to act quickly
or else he'll suffocate.

05:06.374 --> 05:07.408
I'm not watching this.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.343
(exhales)

05:10.110 --> 05:11.612
(inhales sharply)

05:12.546 --> 05:14.982
(grunts)

05:15.015 --> 05:16.617
Cheers.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.620
Are you okay?

05:21.655 --> 05:22.823
Do you want water?

05:22.856 --> 05:23.824
(grunts)

05:23.857 --> 05:25.426
Okay.

05:25.459 --> 05:26.794
Brian.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.061
What?

05:28.095 --> 05:29.597
Long night's work ahead of me.

05:29.630 --> 05:30.864
Okay, great.
Well, good luck with that.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.466
I'll see you later.
No.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.802
I need your assistance
with something.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.505
Kindly grab me something
less bloody to wear,

05:37.538 --> 05:39.440
meet me at my car.
You want to fill me in

05:39.473 --> 05:42.443
on some of the details
of this work, Sands?

05:42.476 --> 05:45.846
Suffice it to say
it concerns our mutual friend.

05:45.879 --> 05:48.549
You won't be
in any physical danger.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.451
Ah.

05:53.587 --> 05:54.788
(sighs)

05:54.822 --> 05:55.823
Come on.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.425
Help me up.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.460
(grunting)

06:00.528 --> 06:03.030
Um...

06:03.063 --> 06:05.599
Okay. So, I think I got
to leave right now.

06:05.633 --> 06:06.867
(door opens, closes)
What?

06:06.900 --> 06:10.438
Yeah. Rach, I need you to do,
like, three things for me, okay?

06:10.471 --> 06:12.773
Hold this. Number one,
do not tell anyone about this.

06:12.806 --> 06:13.974
I mean it. Don't tell anyone.
I...

06:14.007 --> 06:15.175
And number two, do not ask me
Brian...

06:15.208 --> 06:17.177
the hundreds of questions
that are going through your head

06:17.210 --> 06:18.646
right now.
I don't have time to answer 'em.

06:18.679 --> 06:19.847
I will later, maybe.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.649
And number three,
will you do me a solid?

06:21.682 --> 06:23.651
Will you, like,
clean this place up

06:23.684 --> 06:25.118
and just tidy up overall
in general?

06:25.152 --> 06:26.720
Okay.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.689
Rach, I really mean it
when I say don't tell anyone

06:28.722 --> 06:31.459
about this, okay?
Not anyone, ever.

06:31.492 --> 06:32.626
Okay.

06:32.660 --> 06:34.662
Okay. Thanks. Love you. Bye.

06:42.636 --> 06:45.639
*

07:10.130 --> 07:12.132
*

07:14.201 --> 07:16.704
Really?

07:16.737 --> 07:19.139
You're a big guy. I don't have
a lot that fits you.

07:21.909 --> 07:23.711
(tires screech)

07:24.745 --> 07:28.181
So you gonna tell me
what happened?

07:28.215 --> 07:30.484
I ran into an
old colleague.

07:36.089 --> 07:37.124
(shouts)

07:37.157 --> 07:38.626
That has to do with

07:38.659 --> 07:40.093
what we're doing tonight?

07:40.127 --> 07:42.095
You and I are on
separate tracks.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.664
My job is my business.

07:44.698 --> 07:47.000
You find a man

07:47.034 --> 07:49.169
named Frederick Tanner.

07:49.202 --> 07:51.171
He's in or around New York City.

07:51.204 --> 07:53.841
The sooner you're able
to figure out where that is,

07:53.874 --> 07:55.809
the more lives
you'll be able to save.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.010
Is he planning an attack?

07:57.044 --> 07:58.178
It's already
happening.

07:58.211 --> 08:00.113
Mr. Morra wants him
stopped immediately.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.049
(phone ringing)

08:02.082 --> 08:04.818
But the authorities
can't be involved.

08:04.852 --> 08:07.254
Okay, so that's Rebecca.
What do you want me to say?

08:08.088 --> 08:09.256
Hey!

08:09.289 --> 08:10.490
Rebecca Harris is the least
of your concerns right now.

08:10.524 --> 08:13.060
You need to recalibrate your
thoughts to the present moment.

08:13.093 --> 08:15.563
Well, what am I
supposed to tell 'em, Sands?

08:15.596 --> 08:17.998
After you find Tanner,
tell 'em you got mugged.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.266
Okay.

08:19.299 --> 08:21.702
Yeah, that works.
It's believable.

08:21.735 --> 08:25.205
You got pistol-whipped,
lip split. Yeah.

08:25.238 --> 08:27.207
It was really bloody, mate.

08:27.240 --> 08:30.110
You're gonna punch me
in the face later, aren't you?

08:30.143 --> 08:32.145
That pill does make you quicker.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.313
BRIAN: I can't come
to the phone right now,

08:33.346 --> 08:35.315
but if this is an emergency,
you can try Rebecca Harris

08:35.348 --> 08:37.217
any time, day or night.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.219
917-555-0163.

08:39.252 --> 08:40.588
(beep)

08:40.621 --> 08:43.090
Brian, I told you
to change that message.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.792
And charge your phone.

08:44.825 --> 08:47.561
Naz needs everybody in here.

08:47.595 --> 08:50.230
Special Agent
Rebecca Harris.

08:50.263 --> 08:54.201
Nope. No way.
Don't want it.

08:54.234 --> 08:56.570
I was gonna give it to
you in the morning,

08:56.604 --> 08:59.807
but it looks like we're
working past midnight, so...

08:59.840 --> 09:01.208
Throw it away.

09:01.241 --> 09:03.677
You know the rules.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.147
(sighs)

09:12.319 --> 09:14.321
(cupcake splats)

09:19.793 --> 09:21.228
The boy's name is Henry Watkins.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.296
Seven hours ago, he was abducted
from an elementary school

09:23.330 --> 09:25.933
in Williamsburg.

09:25.966 --> 09:28.669
Given that there's been
no contact from the kidnapper,

09:28.702 --> 09:30.203
our colleague at CARD

09:30.237 --> 09:32.005
has asked for our help.

09:32.039 --> 09:33.774
Henry's father is an aide
to the U.S. Perm Rep

09:33.807 --> 09:35.976
to the United Nations,
Daryl Watkins.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.878
Mr. Watkins is
party to sensitive

09:37.911 --> 09:39.046
Security Council information.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.881
Maybe that's why
the boy was targeted.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.816
But considering there's been
no ransom yet,

09:42.850 --> 09:44.885
the time elapsed is worrisome.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.788
Henry Watkins
is also a type 1 diabetic.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.890
And as far as we know,
he does not have access

09:49.923 --> 09:51.625
to medication, so we
have to work quickly

09:51.659 --> 09:52.660
on this one.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.027
I'll be running point with CARD

09:54.061 --> 09:56.129
and Agents Harris and Boyle
will help on the ground.

09:56.163 --> 09:58.131
Thank you.

09:58.165 --> 09:59.700
Where is Brian?

09:59.733 --> 10:00.934
I've called him four times.

10:00.968 --> 10:02.703
Find Finch.
Really sorry

10:02.736 --> 10:04.938
to keep you here all night
right before your birthday.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.140
(sighs)

10:11.044 --> 10:13.981
Okay, so by the power of Google,

10:14.014 --> 10:16.383
Frederick Tanner
is a comptroller

10:16.416 --> 10:18.351
in Spokane, Washington.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.220
Either that, or a recently
deceased orthodontist

10:20.253 --> 10:21.722
from Tuskegee.

10:21.755 --> 10:25.158
So... we good? Can I go home?

10:25.192 --> 10:28.028
The reason Senator Morra
wastes that pill on you

10:28.061 --> 10:30.330
will forever remain
a mystery to me.

10:30.363 --> 10:31.899
Oh, yeah.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.667
You're not allowed to take NZT,
are you?

10:33.701 --> 10:34.935
What's up with that?

10:34.968 --> 10:36.970
The Frederick Tanner I'm looking
for cannot be Googled, Brian.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.808
Then what is your plan, Sands?

10:40.841 --> 10:42.910
I have no source
of information.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.845
How am I supposed to help you?

10:50.984 --> 10:52.285
Runs on UNIX.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.854
Should be
everything you need

10:53.887 --> 10:55.756
to muck about
behind firewalls and such.

10:55.789 --> 10:58.325
What firewalls though?

10:58.358 --> 10:59.893
This is a laptop.

10:59.927 --> 11:01.862
I don't know anything
about this guy.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.363
Look, if you do,
I suggest you start talking,

11:03.396 --> 11:06.499
because otherwise I don't know
what I'm doing here.

11:10.370 --> 11:13.741
Tanner did as much
to make me the man I am

11:13.774 --> 11:15.876
as my actual father did.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.378
More, probably.

11:18.411 --> 11:20.981
BRIAN: I didn't know anything
about Sands before that night,

11:21.014 --> 11:24.184
but his story was epic, like
something out of a comic book.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.219
*

11:28.221 --> 11:29.857
For starters,
I couldn't believe

11:29.890 --> 11:31.859
he used to be in a punk band.

11:31.892 --> 11:33.426
His father was a miner in Kent,

11:33.460 --> 11:35.162
so when the big strike
of '84 happened,

11:35.195 --> 11:36.496
Sands joined the protests.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.031
They got ugly.

11:38.065 --> 11:41.001
Someone threw a brick
and killed a cop.

11:41.034 --> 11:44.071
(man screams)

11:44.104 --> 11:46.740
They held Sands for two weeks
with no formal charges.

11:46.774 --> 11:49.009
One day, a man named Tanner
asked to see him.

11:49.042 --> 11:52.012
They wanted Sands to inform
on the strikers' activities

11:52.045 --> 11:53.146
to the British SIS.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.315
He said no,
but then they threatened

11:55.348 --> 11:58.118
to pin the murder of the cop
on his father.

11:58.151 --> 12:01.054
And so Mr. Sands
took his first job

12:01.088 --> 12:02.289
as a spy.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.858
I started as an informant.

12:04.892 --> 12:07.360
Found I had an aptitude
for the work.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.797
Soon enough...

12:10.563 --> 12:12.265
...I became a proper recruit.

12:12.299 --> 12:14.267
BRIAN:
Sands went to work for MI6,

12:14.301 --> 12:15.869
part of a team of five

12:15.903 --> 12:17.270
that reported
only to Frederick Tanner.

12:17.304 --> 12:19.272
Tanner gave them code names.

12:19.306 --> 12:20.874
Each member of the team

12:20.908 --> 12:23.210
was a director from
the golden age of Hollywood.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.377
There was Wilder;

12:24.411 --> 12:26.346
Lean, who could make stuff
go boom;

12:26.379 --> 12:29.382
DeMille, the pilot;
Huston for surveillance;

12:29.416 --> 12:31.384
and Peckinpah-- that was Sands.

12:31.418 --> 12:34.154
The team acted
with virtual autonomy,

12:34.187 --> 12:37.290
completing operations
all over the world.

12:37.324 --> 12:40.327
There was only one golden rule:
no significant relationships.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.529
No wives, no long-term lovers,

12:42.562 --> 12:44.531
nothing that could
compromise the team.

12:44.564 --> 12:48.101
Then, seven years ago,
they splintered.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.538
What happened to your team?

12:52.873 --> 12:54.341
Did Tanner get involved
with Senator Morra?

12:56.009 --> 12:58.979
Listen, I know you're not
used to being the one

12:59.012 --> 13:00.280
answering the questions.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.249
But you
and this laptop

13:02.282 --> 13:04.818
are my only resources.

13:04.852 --> 13:06.286
If I'm gonna
find this guy,

13:06.319 --> 13:08.255
it's because you tell me
everything you know about him.

13:09.322 --> 13:12.059
You have to tell me
the whole story.

13:22.102 --> 13:24.004
That's Tanner.

13:24.037 --> 13:26.139
What happened to that poor guy?

13:26.173 --> 13:28.976
That, Brian, is a dead man.

13:29.009 --> 13:32.145
Now, I'll answer any further
questions when I get back.

13:32.179 --> 13:33.881
Back from where?

13:34.614 --> 13:36.283
(thunder rumbling softly)

13:36.316 --> 13:37.985
BOYLE:
According to a statement

13:38.018 --> 13:40.520
given to the NYPD, the curb
monitor at Henry's school

13:40.553 --> 13:43.857
claimed the boy's father picked
him up, but when the police

13:43.891 --> 13:45.192
showed her a photo
of Henry's father,

13:45.225 --> 13:47.060
she didn't think
it was the same man.

13:47.094 --> 13:47.861
Same kind of car,
different guy.

13:47.895 --> 13:50.030
Now, why wouldn't
she recognize

13:50.063 --> 13:52.365
the father of one of
her own students?

13:52.399 --> 13:54.134
Well, if the kidnapper
knew enough

13:54.167 --> 13:55.635
to get the same kind of car,

13:55.668 --> 13:58.005
then he was familiar
with his target.
Mm-hmm.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.940
So, assuming he wants
to keep Henry alive,

13:59.973 --> 14:01.374
then he'll need insulin.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.010
So let's get in touch
with local pharmacies

14:03.043 --> 14:04.577
and get a list
of customers who bought

14:04.611 --> 14:05.845
over-the-counter insulin
in the last 72 hours.

14:05.879 --> 14:09.649
You know how many diabetics
there are in the five boroughs?

14:09.682 --> 14:11.885
I got four in my family alone.
It's a start.

14:11.919 --> 14:15.055
And when we get more information
we can cross-reference...

14:15.088 --> 14:16.556
Henry's parents.

14:16.589 --> 14:20.393
They just got a list of
demands from the kidnapper.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.162
BRIAN:
So while Sands did... whatever,

14:22.195 --> 14:24.331
I tried to hack my way
into the personnel files

14:24.364 --> 14:26.266
for the British
Secret Intelligence Service.

14:26.299 --> 14:27.935
It was tedious,
nothing you'd want to see here,

14:27.968 --> 14:29.136
so perpetual dog.

14:29.169 --> 14:30.637
*

14:32.639 --> 14:34.141
You're welcome.

14:40.347 --> 14:42.950
This could work out great
for us, man.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.117
What are you talking about?

14:44.151 --> 14:45.285
I'm driving around
with probably

14:45.318 --> 14:47.187
my least favorite person
in the world,

14:47.220 --> 14:48.956
trying to find a ghost.

14:48.989 --> 14:50.190
Who cares if you can't
find Tanner?

14:50.223 --> 14:51.558
You shouldn't
even try.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.293
Just keep Sands talking.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.162
Learn something about him.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.630
Something you can use the next
time he threatens Rebecca.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.071
I don't know
about the stalling game, bud.

15:04.104 --> 15:05.572
Lives are at stake.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.707
I mean, it'd be great
to get the dirt on Sands,

15:07.740 --> 15:09.943
but have you thought about what
he's doing out here tonight?

15:09.977 --> 15:13.080
He showed up to your place
with a giant wound in his leg

15:13.113 --> 15:14.681
and crossed off the name Wilder.

15:14.714 --> 15:17.584
You think the two of them played
a spirited game of backgammon?

15:19.086 --> 15:20.720
And what's he doing
inside that building?

15:20.753 --> 15:22.255
(distant gunshots)

15:23.156 --> 15:24.491
Looks like DeMille just got

15:24.524 --> 15:26.126
crossed off the grocery list.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.595
Oh, my God.

15:28.628 --> 15:29.596
(dogs barking in distance)

15:29.629 --> 15:31.031
What the hell?

15:31.064 --> 15:33.533
Get in the car.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.202
You told me we were
saving lives.

15:35.235 --> 15:36.403
You're taking out
your old team members?

15:36.436 --> 15:37.570
I don't want a part of that.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.406
You are supposed
to be saving lives.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.675
Saving my former team members
from me.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.411
Frederick Tanner's
forcing me to kill them.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.446
So the sooner you tell me
where he is,

15:46.479 --> 15:48.281
the sooner I can stop doing it.

15:48.315 --> 15:49.316
Now get in the car.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.956
*

16:05.198 --> 16:08.635
Lean should be back
within the hour.

16:08.668 --> 16:13.273
In the meantime,
get comfortable.

16:13.306 --> 16:16.209
Order yourself
a milkshake.

16:16.243 --> 16:18.178
Okay, first of all,

16:18.211 --> 16:19.446
no more killing people.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.382
And second...

16:22.415 --> 16:24.384
I'd love a Neapolitan.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.086
But seriously,
stop killing people.

16:26.119 --> 16:27.620
Well, that's really
up to you, isn't it?

16:27.654 --> 16:30.123
(sighs) What, do you think,
I just waggle my finger

16:30.157 --> 16:32.459
at that thing
and answers come out like magic?

16:32.492 --> 16:35.428
If he was in MI6,
then he's not on Facebook.

16:35.462 --> 16:37.330
You're still my best source.

16:37.364 --> 16:41.101
So... why is Tanner
targeting his old team?

16:42.502 --> 16:45.405
And why are you
letting him use you to do it?

16:51.611 --> 16:53.413
Tanner spent
the last seven years

16:53.446 --> 16:56.483
in extrajudicial confinement.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.718
It may not surprise you to learn
that some of our activities

16:58.751 --> 17:01.221
fell on the wrong
side of the law.

17:01.254 --> 17:02.322
*

17:02.355 --> 17:03.690
BRIAN:
It all went south in India.

17:03.723 --> 17:05.058
(tiger roars)

17:05.092 --> 17:06.393
Not that part of India--
the north,

17:06.426 --> 17:08.095
where Tanner and his men
controlled

17:08.128 --> 17:09.496
a secret airstrip
that brought British weapons

17:09.529 --> 17:12.432
into the country
with no oversight.

17:12.465 --> 17:14.367
Of course, when you have
your own private smuggling hub,

17:14.401 --> 17:16.503
it's tempting
to use it for profit.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.172
They made a mint
and lived like kings,

17:19.206 --> 17:20.473
until someone from back home

17:20.507 --> 17:22.742
figured out
what they were up to.

17:22.775 --> 17:25.545
The team turned on Tanner
in exchange for immunity.

17:25.578 --> 17:27.547
They were expelled from MI6

17:27.580 --> 17:30.117
and barred from practicing
private spycraft in the U.K.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.318
(gavel bangs)

17:31.351 --> 17:34.321
(slurping)

17:36.523 --> 17:39.592
Okay. So he's out of jail.
What happened?

17:39.626 --> 17:41.161
Don't know.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.295
Maybe he escaped.

17:42.329 --> 17:43.330
Maybe he found
a patron

17:43.363 --> 17:45.532
and got himself a pardon.

17:45.565 --> 17:46.666
But he's free.

17:46.699 --> 17:49.236
And he's using you
to take out

17:49.269 --> 17:52.305
everyone
who turned on him.

17:52.339 --> 17:55.242
And you're going along
with this why, exactly?

17:56.643 --> 17:59.412
That information isn't gonna
help you find Tanner.

17:59.446 --> 18:01.581
Is that true?

18:03.650 --> 18:06.219
Or do you just
not want to tell me?

18:08.488 --> 18:10.223
Okay.

18:10.257 --> 18:11.558
You know what?

18:12.725 --> 18:14.727
I'm done here. (sighs)

18:15.828 --> 18:17.430
Sit down.

18:17.464 --> 18:20.433
Unless you want me to
reach out to Mr. Morra.

18:20.467 --> 18:21.534
No, see,
I don't think you will.

18:21.568 --> 18:23.470
When you showed up
to my apartment

18:23.503 --> 18:26.439
and I said we should
get in touch with the senator,

18:26.473 --> 18:29.742
you almost had yourself
a panic attack.

18:29.776 --> 18:32.645
Because he doesn't know
about any of this, does he?

18:32.679 --> 18:34.247
You're freelancing.

18:34.281 --> 18:37.584
Which means you can't hold
the immunity shot back from me.

18:37.617 --> 18:40.920
You haven't got
any leverage at all.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.589
But I do.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.457
What would Morra think

18:44.491 --> 18:47.827
if he learned you were
going on a murder spree

18:47.860 --> 18:50.597
while he was
running for president?

18:50.630 --> 18:52.532
Whew.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.534
Good luck with that.

18:56.536 --> 18:58.671
Okay, well, we'll need
DNA samples from you both

18:58.705 --> 19:00.240
and Henry, of course.

19:00.273 --> 19:02.675
Uh, we should
talk about Henry.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.377
Our son's adopted.

19:04.411 --> 19:06.579
Have we checked out
the biological parents?

19:06.613 --> 19:07.780
The adoption
agency told us

19:07.814 --> 19:09.249
Henry's parents
are both deceased.

19:09.282 --> 19:11.284
Well, that might
eliminate a suspect,

19:11.318 --> 19:14.387
but it still doesn't explain
how Henry's curb monitor

19:14.421 --> 19:16.456
was fooled by somebody
claiming to be his father.

19:16.489 --> 19:19.292
Uh, someone pulled up
in a car that matched mine.

19:19.326 --> 19:22.895
Henry must have gotten in
without looking.

19:22.929 --> 19:25.265
It was a-a substitute
curb monitor,

19:25.298 --> 19:26.866
actually.

19:26.899 --> 19:29.236
The school has a very
strict pickup policy,

19:29.269 --> 19:32.205
but today was that
monitor's first day.

19:36.676 --> 19:39.212
I can hear you moving around
in there, Finch.

19:39.246 --> 19:41.614
You know, the knock
is just for courtesy.

19:45.952 --> 19:48.655
Hi. I'm Rachel.

19:48.688 --> 19:49.722
Brian's not here right now.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.724
Yeah, I remember.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.561
I'm sort of supposed to check.

19:54.594 --> 19:57.697
Oh. Yeah.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.732
Come on in.

20:01.568 --> 20:03.503
Brian and I were just
hanging out.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.472
He went to get a pizza.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.540
I'm sure he'll be back soon.

20:07.574 --> 20:09.309
That's not mine.

20:09.342 --> 20:11.411
Brian said he signed
a waiver or something?

20:11.444 --> 20:12.712
Munchies.
(phone ringing)

20:12.745 --> 20:13.980
That checks out.

20:14.013 --> 20:15.615
(chuckles)

20:15.648 --> 20:17.750
I'm sorry, just one second.
Hello?

20:17.784 --> 20:19.286
You got a Brian update for me?

20:19.319 --> 20:20.320
I'm at his place right now.

20:20.353 --> 20:22.021
His sister said he went
to go get some pizza.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.623
Wait there. Call me

20:23.656 --> 20:25.525
as soon as he gets back.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.695
They, uh, want me to wait here
till he gets back.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.430
Is that... is that okay?

20:35.368 --> 20:37.570
Guess we're hanging out, huh?

20:44.811 --> 20:47.514
Must feel nice.

20:47.547 --> 20:50.016
Having the upper hand
for a change.

20:50.049 --> 20:52.685
You were right.
I haven't told you everything.

20:52.719 --> 20:54.887
I didn't want
to turn on Tanner.

20:54.921 --> 20:58.458
In fact, I promised my team
they'd have to deal with me

20:58.491 --> 21:01.561
even if they entertained
the idea of ratting him out.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.396
What changed your mind?

21:03.430 --> 21:05.465
There was
a complicating factor.

21:05.498 --> 21:09.302
The classic
complicating factor.

21:09.336 --> 21:11.971
BRIAN: Sands violated
the cardinal rule:

21:12.004 --> 21:14.574
no attachments.

21:14.607 --> 21:17.410
She was an aid worker
named Anastasia.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.011
Tanner got suspicious.

21:19.045 --> 21:20.580
(camera clicking)

21:20.613 --> 21:22.815
(Anastasia screams,
tires screech)

21:22.849 --> 21:26.052
Anastasia was killed
in a hit-and-run.

21:26.085 --> 21:28.955
Sands could never prove
it was Tanner, but he knew.

21:28.988 --> 21:30.990
And after that,
he joined with the others

21:31.023 --> 21:32.559
to send Tanner to prison.

21:32.592 --> 21:34.861
I'm sorry.

21:34.894 --> 21:36.529
Really am.

21:36.563 --> 21:40.367
But Anastasia's
been gone for years.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.935
That doesn't explain why you're
killing people for Tanner.

21:42.969 --> 21:46.639
I mean, you're the one
with leverage over him.

21:46.673 --> 21:49.876
I mean, unless...

21:49.909 --> 21:52.745
unless he's got
something over you.

21:54.046 --> 21:55.948
The last person who
saw Henry Watkins

21:55.982 --> 21:57.617
was a substitute
curb monitor.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.519
Now, if the regular
curb monitor

21:59.552 --> 22:01.488
had been out with a
cold or something,

22:01.521 --> 22:03.423
I might have thought
it was a coincidence,

22:03.456 --> 22:05.558
But she was out recovering
from a car accident.

22:05.592 --> 22:06.959
James, can you show him

22:06.993 --> 22:08.528
the collision of
Kristen Vicente?

22:08.561 --> 22:10.530
Surely I can.

22:21.541 --> 22:22.509
It was a hit-and-run.

22:22.542 --> 22:24.944
That car
targeted her.

22:24.977 --> 22:26.813
So we ran the plates,
the car was stolen.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.014
And I had James

22:28.047 --> 22:29.682
enhance the image
of the driver

22:29.716 --> 22:31.484
and then cross-reference
that with customers

22:31.518 --> 22:33.820
who bought over-the-counter
insulin in the five boroughs

22:33.853 --> 22:36.022
in the last 72 hours, and...

22:36.055 --> 22:37.857
This guy paid cash
for the insulin,

22:37.890 --> 22:39.859
so we don't have a name.

22:45.565 --> 22:48.034
Looks like a match to me.

22:48.067 --> 22:50.537
I bet he has Henry Watkins.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.672
NEWSWOMAN:
The boy has been identified

22:52.705 --> 22:54.874
as seven-year-old Henry Watkins,

22:54.907 --> 22:58.545
son of Daryl Watkins, chief aide
to the U.S. Permanent Rep

22:58.578 --> 22:59.679
to the United Nations.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.113
No comment has been made,

23:01.147 --> 23:04.517
but we understand ransom demands
are being negotiated.

23:04.551 --> 23:06.152
The 30-year fixed mortgage...

23:06.185 --> 23:08.588
You had a kid
with Anastasia.

23:08.621 --> 23:09.889
That's why you're
doing this.

23:09.922 --> 23:12.525
Tanner won't let my son go

23:12.559 --> 23:13.960
until every name
on that list is gone.

23:13.993 --> 23:16.696
And he wants it
all done tonight,

23:16.729 --> 23:18.631
so no one has time
to react and run.

23:18.665 --> 23:21.133
Every name?

23:21.167 --> 23:22.935
The last name on that
list is Peckinpah.

23:22.969 --> 23:24.003
That's you, right?

23:24.036 --> 23:25.472
Yeah.

23:26.105 --> 23:27.840
The night ends on me.

23:29.776 --> 23:31.778
(exhales)

23:37.650 --> 23:41.020
All right. All right.

23:41.053 --> 23:43.022
I'll help you.

23:43.055 --> 23:46.793
But we have to focus
on finding Tanner.

23:46.826 --> 23:49.596
No more killing.

23:49.629 --> 23:52.565
There's just one more thing
I didn't tell you.

23:52.599 --> 23:54.767
(man coughing)

23:56.002 --> 23:57.770
You weren't waiting
for Lean to come home.

23:57.804 --> 23:59.639
You were waiting for
him to come here.

23:59.672 --> 24:01.841
I realize this looks bad, but we
didn't have our agreement yet.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.009
What did you give him?

24:03.042 --> 24:04.677
Digoxin.

24:04.711 --> 24:06.212
And a trace of cyanide.

24:06.245 --> 24:08.748
WOMAN:
Can we get some help here?!

24:08.781 --> 24:10.583
(mouthing)
190 milligrams of

24:10.617 --> 24:12.719
amyl nitrate, sodium
thiosulfate-- what's that?

24:12.752 --> 24:13.886
The antidote.

24:13.920 --> 24:16.222
Brian!

24:16.255 --> 24:18.591
What are you doing?

24:18.625 --> 24:20.693
I may or may not have seen
a Murder, She Wrote about this.

24:20.727 --> 24:22.194
And if we leave a note
for the paramedics,

24:22.228 --> 24:23.796
it'll save them time
diagnosing him.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.598
MAN: Someone help!
Call an ambulance!

24:25.632 --> 24:27.166
(grunting)

24:27.199 --> 24:28.901
Now, do we have a deal?

24:28.935 --> 24:30.236
(hands shake)

24:30.269 --> 24:31.571
Good.

24:31.604 --> 24:32.605
Sir...
(grunts)

24:41.280 --> 24:43.482
*

24:47.720 --> 24:50.122
BRIAN: So, wait,
this is Huston?

24:50.156 --> 24:51.924
(monitor beeping steadily)

24:51.958 --> 24:54.727
Not that we're here
to kill anyone.

24:54.761 --> 24:57.229
But usually, when you're going
down a list of bad guys,

24:57.263 --> 24:59.298
they're supposed
to get tougher.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.534
This guy's
easy pickings.

25:01.568 --> 25:03.803
I mean, you had
a key to his place.

25:03.836 --> 25:06.739
You could've
pulled the plug at any time.

25:06.773 --> 25:08.174
Yet you saved him for last?

25:12.745 --> 25:15.047
We're sorry
for dropping in so late.

25:15.081 --> 25:18.117
Oh, I'm sure he's just
happy you're here, Jarrod.

25:18.150 --> 25:20.687
I'll be in the library
if you need anything.

25:23.956 --> 25:27.259
You didn't want
to come here first...

25:27.293 --> 25:30.730
'cause you didn't want
to cross him off the list.

25:30.763 --> 25:32.064
You're friends.

25:34.266 --> 25:37.837
You told me you weren't
in touch with your team.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.739
Huston's the exception
to the rule.

25:41.808 --> 25:43.810
He saved my life.

25:43.843 --> 25:45.778
BRIAN: After Mr. Sands
betrayed Tanner,

25:45.812 --> 25:48.848
his first priority was making
sure his kid would be safe.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.817
(baby crying)

25:50.850 --> 25:53.319
And then he returned
to the only life he knew.

25:53.352 --> 25:55.855
He managed to pick up
some private mercenary work,

25:55.888 --> 25:58.024
but the people who hired him
disavowed him

25:58.057 --> 26:00.960
as soon as he got arrested
and left him to rot.

26:00.993 --> 26:04.230
It seems he was doomed
to a life in prison.

26:05.397 --> 26:08.300
Until one day,
he got another shot.

26:08.334 --> 26:10.069
Huston had paid off
the right people

26:10.102 --> 26:12.839
in order to find and release
his old friend.

26:12.872 --> 26:14.774
It turns out,
Huston had found work

26:14.807 --> 26:17.810
with a promising young
politician named Edward Morra

26:17.844 --> 26:19.846
who might have use
for a guy like Sands.

26:19.879 --> 26:23.315
He gave me the life I've got
today, which is why I'm so loath

26:23.349 --> 26:25.351
to end his.

26:28.054 --> 26:30.389
But I've got to show Tanner
that I'm making progress.

26:30.422 --> 26:33.359
So what are you gonna do?
You gonna fake his death?

26:36.896 --> 26:38.931
Something like that.

26:39.999 --> 26:42.001
I don't know, all right?

26:44.336 --> 26:47.006
He's seven-eighths
of the way there already.

26:47.039 --> 26:49.742
I don't see what's so hard
about feigning the last eighth.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.210
Why eighths?

26:51.243 --> 26:52.779
Wh...

26:56.282 --> 27:00.219
Didn't you tell me that it was
Huston's idea to turn on Tanner?

27:00.252 --> 27:02.288
He must've felt pretty
confident in the betrayal

27:02.321 --> 27:04.256
because he had
some kind of dirt on him.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.725
I mean, Huston was
the extortionist

27:05.758 --> 27:06.759
of the group, right?

27:08.928 --> 27:11.163
Sands, if I search this place,
what are the odds

27:11.197 --> 27:12.865
that I'd find something
on Tanner?

27:12.899 --> 27:14.967
Well, if you want to have a go,
I suggest you do so quickly.

27:17.003 --> 27:18.805
REBECCA: This is from
the security cameras

27:18.838 --> 27:19.972
in the parking lot.

27:20.006 --> 27:21.674
This is the car
the suspect got into

27:21.708 --> 27:22.842
after he bought the insulin.

27:22.875 --> 27:24.677
This all started as a hunch.

27:24.711 --> 27:27.079
Well, all good ideas do.

27:27.113 --> 27:29.248
I will alert
the rest of task force.

27:29.281 --> 27:31.784
And, uh, what ever happened
to Finch?

27:31.818 --> 27:33.152
She never heard back from him.

27:33.185 --> 27:35.154
And what's your
hunch about that?

27:35.187 --> 27:36.823
I don't have one.

27:36.856 --> 27:38.324
But I'm worried.

27:38.357 --> 27:40.793
Check in again with Ike.
Keep me posted.

27:40.827 --> 27:42.929
And, listen, if you
want to call it a night,

27:42.962 --> 27:45.031
you have earned it;
it is your birthday, after all.

27:45.064 --> 27:47.033
Yeah.
I would rather stay.

27:47.066 --> 27:48.234
Thanks.

27:49.368 --> 27:52.038
You know what I think
happened to Finch?

27:52.071 --> 27:55.942
He probably got stoned,
ate too many street nuts,

27:55.975 --> 27:57.209
and he's debating
the meaning

27:57.243 --> 27:59.879
of Trump with the Balto statue
in Central Park.

27:59.912 --> 28:02.448
In other words, he's fine.

28:02.481 --> 28:04.884
Well, we can't assume that.
I just mean

28:04.917 --> 28:07.019
we have an actual
lost kid to worry about.

28:07.053 --> 28:09.088
Don't waste your energy
on Finch the flake.

28:14.426 --> 28:16.228
*

28:29.508 --> 28:32.311
Do you want to know
why I hate my birthday?

28:32.344 --> 28:33.813
(chuckles softly)

28:34.947 --> 28:37.149
A couple of years ago,
my dad came to me

28:37.183 --> 28:39.518
and he said he was
turning his life around,

28:39.551 --> 28:41.954
he wanted to get clean,
and that he wanted

28:41.988 --> 28:44.390
to celebrate my birthday
with me, 'cause he'd missed

28:44.423 --> 28:46.025
so many of them.

28:46.058 --> 28:49.328
I was reluctant to say yes,
but I did, and...

28:49.361 --> 28:52.298
my mom drove up,
my sister came over.

28:52.331 --> 28:53.933
There was cake.

28:53.966 --> 28:56.202
And we waited.

28:56.235 --> 28:59.906
But, like always,
he never showed up.

28:59.939 --> 29:01.808
And do you want to know

29:01.841 --> 29:04.376
what I wished for when
I blew out my birthday candles?

29:08.915 --> 29:11.050
That he would die.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.252
And leave me the hell alone.

29:13.285 --> 29:15.221
Reb, you can't
blame yourself for that.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.023
You did not cause him to...

29:17.056 --> 29:18.825
No, it...

29:18.858 --> 29:20.860
Because he was already dead.

29:21.994 --> 29:24.196
Two weeks later, I found out

29:24.230 --> 29:28.034
that while I was cursing his
name because he didn't show up,

29:28.067 --> 29:31.871
he was rotting
in the East River.

29:31.904 --> 29:34.140
I had assumed...

29:34.173 --> 29:36.008
that he flaked.

29:37.576 --> 29:39.111
Now, while this
might have seemed like

29:39.145 --> 29:40.412
a promising source
of information,

29:40.446 --> 29:42.248
considering Huston
specialized in extortion

29:42.281 --> 29:44.516
and blackmail, it turns out
that his apartment

29:44.550 --> 29:46.285
is as vacuous as he is.

29:46.318 --> 29:47.920
But I did find this.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.957
This is a key

29:50.990 --> 29:52.892
to a safe deposit box,
and I'm pretty damn sure

29:52.925 --> 29:55.294
it belongs to CaroBank, that's
just a few blocks from here.

29:55.327 --> 29:57.129
How do you know?

29:57.163 --> 29:58.898
Because for the next few hours,

29:58.931 --> 30:01.167
I'm still one of the smartest
people in the world.

30:02.368 --> 30:03.435
And the night nurse told me.

30:03.469 --> 30:04.703
Hmm.
She said that

30:04.736 --> 30:08.507
Huston instructed her to use it
if anyone ever showed up to--

30:08.540 --> 30:10.009
oh, I don't know--

30:10.042 --> 30:12.011
kill him
in the middle of the night.

30:13.179 --> 30:16.082
She said this key unlocks
whatever dirt he has

30:16.115 --> 30:17.917
on his old
colleagues.

30:17.950 --> 30:19.251
Some sort of burn book
that she'd

30:19.285 --> 30:20.486
release to authorities
if need be.

30:20.519 --> 30:21.620
Then let's go get it.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.622
Well, hold on.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.591
CaroBank doesn't open
till well after sunrise.

30:25.624 --> 30:28.594
So how do we get
into the safe deposit box

30:28.627 --> 30:31.597
of a massively secure bank that
isn't even open for business?

30:32.498 --> 30:34.333
Without killing people.

30:34.366 --> 30:36.202
Why must you always
make things harder?

30:36.235 --> 30:38.905
Yeah, I'll keep you posted.

30:38.938 --> 30:40.039
Rebecca again?
Yeah.

30:40.072 --> 30:42.174
Told her we haven't
heard from him.

30:42.208 --> 30:44.343
My brother do this
to you guys a lot?

30:44.376 --> 30:45.611
Just disappear?

30:45.644 --> 30:46.612
Occasionally.

30:46.645 --> 30:48.014
(phone vibrates)

30:48.047 --> 30:49.581
Is that him?

30:49.615 --> 30:51.383
I don't think so.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.485
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Rachel, it's me. Brian.

30:53.519 --> 30:57.089
Wanted you to know I'm okay.
Are you?

30:57.123 --> 30:58.524
RACHEL:
How do I know it's you?

31:00.559 --> 31:02.561
AUTOMATED VOICE: When you were
in second grade, you accidently

31:02.594 --> 31:04.463
drank Dad's beer
and ran into the sliding door.

31:04.496 --> 31:07.666
That's why your nose
looks a little broken.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.501
So was that
your boyfriend or...?

31:09.535 --> 31:10.937
It's Brian.

31:12.538 --> 31:16.208
He said he... ran into a girl
while getting pizza.

31:17.476 --> 31:19.645
He's probably
gonna be a while.

31:19.678 --> 31:22.915
Well, Rebecca said I should
stay here till I see him.

31:23.983 --> 31:26.552
He must be pretty important
to you guys, huh?

31:26.585 --> 31:28.087
Definitely.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.089
You must be
pretty important, too,

31:30.122 --> 31:31.958
considering you're
assigned to him.

31:31.991 --> 31:35.394
Uh... (chuckles) I'm not
that important, no. I...

31:35.427 --> 31:37.296
I just...

31:37.329 --> 31:39.531
It's my job to protect him.

31:39.565 --> 31:41.200
That's important to me.

31:45.237 --> 31:48.907
Well, I-I did
take a bullet once.

31:50.409 --> 31:51.677
Seriously?

31:51.710 --> 31:53.679
Mm.

31:53.712 --> 31:56.415
You took a bullet
to save my brother's life?

31:59.685 --> 32:02.388
That's pretty much
the way it happened.

32:06.125 --> 32:07.559
Hi there.

32:07.593 --> 32:08.560
(gasps)
Sorry!

32:08.594 --> 32:10.562
Don't freak out,
don't freak out. Shh, shh, shh.

32:10.596 --> 32:13.165
I don't have a lot of time.
Here's the deal, Mr. Matthews.

32:13.199 --> 32:15.434
You are the CEO of CaroBank,
and I happen to have

32:15.467 --> 32:17.336
a unique problem that involves
one of your branches.

32:17.369 --> 32:19.405
Just take whatever you want.

32:19.438 --> 32:21.373
I'm not gonna rob you, man.
I just need access

32:21.407 --> 32:23.175
to the Midtown branch
before banking hours

32:23.209 --> 32:24.977
so I can open a safe deposit box

32:25.011 --> 32:27.446
using this
perfectly legitimate key.

32:27.479 --> 32:29.748
Like I said,
I'm not gonna take anything,

32:29.781 --> 32:32.684
I'm not gonna hurt anyone,
but if I don't get what I want,

32:32.718 --> 32:35.054
well, I did peruse your
personal computer over there,

32:35.087 --> 32:37.623
and you, Mr. Matthews,
have a penchant

32:37.656 --> 32:40.159
for high-priced escorts.

32:40.192 --> 32:41.427
A lot of 'em.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.629
Hi. How you doing, ma'ams?

32:43.662 --> 32:44.997
I know you're

32:45.031 --> 32:46.765
hard at work over there.
No judgment.

32:46.798 --> 32:49.335
I just really
got to get into that branch.

32:52.704 --> 32:53.872
Turns out, Mr. Matthews
was pretty accommodating,

32:53.905 --> 32:55.741
given the right kind
of motivation.
(phone ringing)

32:55.774 --> 32:58.277
He called the Midtown
branch manager and told him

32:58.310 --> 32:59.745
a very special client
needed access

32:59.778 --> 33:02.248
to his safety deposit box
right away.

33:02.281 --> 33:05.317
In no time, I was opening
the safety deposit box,

33:05.351 --> 33:07.286
and there it was--
Huston's burn book.

33:07.319 --> 33:09.355
Now we just have to hope
Tanner's in it.

33:09.388 --> 33:11.757
BOYLE:
Reb.

33:11.790 --> 33:14.526
NAZ: I just spoke
with Jackson in CARD.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.728
A witness spotted
your Bronco in Flushing

33:16.762 --> 33:18.230
at an abandoned property.

33:18.264 --> 33:21.100
It's registered to a Val Lewton.
Who's that?

33:21.133 --> 33:22.534
We're looking into it,
but I told S.A. Bradley

33:22.568 --> 33:24.070
you two are taking point.

33:24.103 --> 33:25.304
Okay.

33:25.337 --> 33:26.505
This is where
it gets interesting.

33:26.538 --> 33:28.307
He kept notes on all you guys--

33:28.340 --> 33:30.809
Wilder, Lean
and one Val Lewton.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.411
And who in the hell's that?

33:32.444 --> 33:33.812
Well, you said
Tanner based your aliases

33:33.845 --> 33:35.514
on notorious directors
of American cinema.

33:35.547 --> 33:37.249
Doesn't it make sense
that he'd go by a similar alias?

33:37.283 --> 33:39.685
Yeah, but I've never heard of
Val Lewton, alias or director.

33:39.718 --> 33:43.489
Actually, he was a producer
of genre films in the mid-'40s.

33:43.522 --> 33:46.692
Best known for psychological
horror-thriller Cat People.

33:46.725 --> 33:47.693
What would I do without you?

33:47.726 --> 33:49.695
Mm. You jest, but Val Lewton--

33:49.728 --> 33:51.230
the alias, not the director--

33:51.263 --> 33:53.399
owns a particular property
in Queens.

33:53.432 --> 33:55.701
Undeveloped warehouse
that seems pretty perfect

33:55.734 --> 33:57.203
for hiding a kid.

33:59.305 --> 34:00.306
(whispers):
Good job, Brian.

34:14.486 --> 34:16.488
*

34:20.692 --> 34:23.295
BRIAN: I may not be able to hack
into MI6, but the New York City

34:23.329 --> 34:25.097
Housing Authority
is a whole different thing.

34:25.131 --> 34:26.132
All right, there are the plans.

34:26.165 --> 34:28.600
I also found that a neighbor
lodged a complaint

34:28.634 --> 34:30.669
about recent construction,
saying that they were building

34:30.702 --> 34:32.504
some sort of basement
without a permit.

34:32.538 --> 34:34.640
I'm guessing that's where
Tanner's keeping your son,

34:34.673 --> 34:37.643
and if I wait right here
around the back...

34:37.676 --> 34:39.411
You're staying here.

34:39.445 --> 34:40.546
What?

34:40.579 --> 34:42.281
Tanner's in there with my son.

34:42.314 --> 34:43.682
And who knows how many weapons.

34:43.715 --> 34:45.217
Exactly.

34:45.251 --> 34:46.718
Uh, you need help.

34:50.822 --> 34:52.491
Fine.

34:52.524 --> 34:53.892
Thank you.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.594
You get to Henry, get him out.

34:55.627 --> 34:57.263
Just stay away from Tanner.

34:57.296 --> 34:58.664
I'll handle him.

34:58.697 --> 35:01.267
Remember what I said earlier?

35:01.300 --> 35:03.502
Yeah, I know. And I made an
agreement, and I've honored it,

35:03.535 --> 35:05.704
but I just don't know if I can
do that here. This is...

35:05.737 --> 35:06.705
Different.

35:06.738 --> 35:08.840
I know. He's got your son.

35:08.874 --> 35:10.709
Do what you have to do.

35:14.913 --> 35:17.115
*

35:36.335 --> 35:38.804
*

35:42.774 --> 35:46.212
BRIAN: So what happened in there
between Sands and Tanner?

35:46.245 --> 35:47.479
Was it a duel?

35:47.513 --> 35:49.348
A fight?

35:49.381 --> 35:52.384
Were samurai swords
somehow involved?

35:52.418 --> 35:54.420
I have no idea.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.491
I just know how it ended.

36:10.669 --> 36:12.538
Henry? Hey.

36:12.571 --> 36:13.805
Don't worry, buddy.
I'm here to help.

36:13.839 --> 36:15.474
Listen, I'm
sorry, I got to

36:15.507 --> 36:16.908
leave your blindfold
on for now, okay?

36:16.942 --> 36:18.844
But everything's gonna
be fine, I promise.

36:18.877 --> 36:22.314
Get your hands free?
You got 'em? Okay.

36:22.348 --> 36:24.383
Can you do
me a favor?
Mm-hmm.

36:24.416 --> 36:26.418
Just put your arms
around my neck

36:26.452 --> 36:28.254
and hold on real tight, okay?

36:28.287 --> 36:29.721
All right, great job.

36:30.722 --> 36:32.624
An innocent kid was safe.

36:32.658 --> 36:34.760
He was going home
to his parents.

36:34.793 --> 36:37.496
He'd never know
who came to his rescue or why.

36:38.697 --> 36:41.400
All right. Here you go.

36:41.433 --> 36:43.335
You're out of there.
Just hang on.

36:43.369 --> 36:44.503
But I know.

36:44.536 --> 36:45.804
Everything's gonna be fine.

36:45.837 --> 36:46.705
Any minute now.

36:50.776 --> 36:53.345
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

36:53.379 --> 36:54.613
It's okay, there
you go, yeah.

36:54.646 --> 36:55.814
Okay.
You got him?

36:55.847 --> 36:57.849
Yeah.

37:03.389 --> 37:05.424
It's okay. I'll get you
home to your parents.

37:07.359 --> 37:08.727
(car door closes)

37:08.760 --> 37:09.761
(panting)

37:09.795 --> 37:11.430
How you doing? You all right?

37:11.463 --> 37:13.332
Yeah. All things considered.

37:13.365 --> 37:15.834
You know, it's okay,
you can say thank you.

37:17.002 --> 37:18.337
I got your son out of there,

37:18.370 --> 37:19.505
I saved your life three times,

37:19.538 --> 37:20.506
by my count.

37:20.539 --> 37:21.773
Come on.

37:21.807 --> 37:25.344
You're a big boy.

37:25.377 --> 37:27.779
You can say it.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.316
Thank you.

37:32.418 --> 37:33.752
Yeah, you're welcome.

37:33.785 --> 37:35.354
It's been
an interesting night.

37:35.387 --> 37:36.855
Turns out, there's something
you actually care about...

37:38.490 --> 37:40.692
You got mugged,
remember?

37:40.726 --> 37:42.694
I do now.

37:42.728 --> 37:44.530
Helps sell the story.

37:44.563 --> 37:45.697
It's all right.

37:45.731 --> 37:47.866
You can say thank you
if you want.

37:50.669 --> 37:52.671
(sirens wailing in distance)

37:54.740 --> 37:56.742
(engine starts)

38:03.615 --> 38:05.617
(sirens wailing,
tires screeching)

38:14.460 --> 38:15.727
MAN:
SWAT's taking lead.

38:15.761 --> 38:17.763
(guns clicking, urgent chatter)

38:22.801 --> 38:24.069
NEWSWOMAN:
And it's a happy ending

38:24.102 --> 38:25.571
for a young Manhattan boy

38:25.604 --> 38:27.406
reported missing yesterday,

38:27.439 --> 38:30.642
who was reunited with
his parents early this morning.

38:30.676 --> 38:32.344
(knocking)

38:33.545 --> 38:35.046
Brian.

38:36.448 --> 38:37.716
What happened?

38:37.749 --> 38:39.518
Are you okay?

38:39.551 --> 38:41.620
Yeah. I went to go
pick up some pizza

38:41.653 --> 38:43.355
and some guy decided
he wanted my wallet.

38:43.389 --> 38:45.957
You got mugged?
For all $11 that
I had in my wallet.

38:45.991 --> 38:47.025
And my phone.

38:47.058 --> 38:49.561
But he left the pizza,
so I guess that was nice.

38:49.595 --> 38:50.996
You okay?

38:51.029 --> 38:53.599
Yeah, I just waited,
like, four hours in the E.R.,

38:53.632 --> 38:55.601
but no concussion,
so that's good.

38:55.634 --> 38:56.635
(clears throat)
What about you?

38:56.668 --> 39:00.005
Are you okay? What's up
with this emergency case?

39:00.038 --> 39:02.708
Well, it's over, actually.

39:02.741 --> 39:04.009
Really? What happened?

39:04.042 --> 39:05.010
It was a kidnapping.

39:05.043 --> 39:06.077
A weird one.

39:06.111 --> 39:07.045
We found the kid, he's fine.

39:07.078 --> 39:08.914
He was actually sitting
in a parking garage

39:08.947 --> 39:11.517
across from his family's
house in Chelsea.

39:11.550 --> 39:12.818
He was weirded out,

39:12.851 --> 39:13.852
but he's okay.

39:13.885 --> 39:15.120
Wow.
Yeah.

39:15.153 --> 39:16.722
It was a wild night.

39:16.755 --> 39:18.123
I'm a little wrecked.

39:18.156 --> 39:20.358
You know what,
maybe this will help.

39:23.762 --> 39:25.764
What is that?

39:25.797 --> 39:27.833
It's a birthday gift.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.635
For your birthday.

39:29.668 --> 39:31.403
You know, in some cultures,
it's customary...

39:31.437 --> 39:33.739
You got mugged and you still
bought me a birthday present?

39:33.772 --> 39:35.707
Yeah, of course.
Hey, a birthday's a birthday.

39:35.741 --> 39:36.775
You made it
through another year;

39:36.808 --> 39:38.744
that is worth celebrating.

39:38.777 --> 39:41.980
Regardless of
whatever else happened.

39:42.013 --> 39:44.716
Thank you.

39:44.750 --> 39:46.051
I think.

39:46.084 --> 39:46.918
Sorry about the wrapping.

39:46.952 --> 39:48.787
Oh, no, the wrapping
is my favorite part.

39:54.660 --> 39:56.762
What is it?

39:56.795 --> 39:57.863
It's a pillow.

39:57.896 --> 39:58.897
For napping.

39:58.930 --> 40:01.132
Anywhere you want.

40:01.166 --> 40:02.668
Like, if you get called in

40:02.701 --> 40:04.636
on a midnight kidnapping case,
for example,

40:04.670 --> 40:05.904
then you can sleep...

40:05.937 --> 40:06.905
Through it?

40:06.938 --> 40:07.773
Nah, just the boring parts.

40:07.806 --> 40:09.675
You want me to show you
how it works?

40:09.708 --> 40:11.543
Okay, so this is the...
this is the front.

40:11.577 --> 40:13.579
This is where
your mouth breathes.

40:13.612 --> 40:15.747
And then you put it
on your head.

40:15.781 --> 40:17.082
(laughs)

40:17.115 --> 40:19.685
You just put it
on your head like this.

40:21.219 --> 40:22.588
Oh, God.
Sleep anywhere.

40:22.621 --> 40:24.523
It's all right.
It's genius.

40:24.556 --> 40:25.857
I'll get you another one
for your next birthday.

40:25.891 --> 40:27.158
(laughs)
That's really nice.

40:27.192 --> 40:28.794
Then you can put...
then you put your head...

40:28.827 --> 40:30.496
hands-hands in here like this.

40:30.529 --> 40:32.698
Yeah.
You see?

40:39.671 --> 40:40.639
Oh, you're back.

40:40.672 --> 40:41.940
Geez, Rach, you scared me.

40:41.973 --> 40:43.642
I didn't realize
you were still here.

40:43.675 --> 40:44.810
What are you wearing?

40:44.843 --> 40:45.877
What's up
with your eye?

40:45.911 --> 40:47.479
(yawns)

40:47.513 --> 40:49.615
IKE:
Oh.

40:49.648 --> 40:51.650
What are you...?

40:51.683 --> 40:53.985
I'm sorry. Uh...

40:54.019 --> 40:55.487
Brian...
BRIAN: Oh, my God.

40:55.521 --> 40:57.222
Oh, my God!

40:57.255 --> 40:59.224
Calm down, okay?
Oh, my God!

40:59.257 --> 41:00.492
You're totally overreacting.

41:00.526 --> 41:01.359
I'm overreacting?
Yes, you are.

41:01.392 --> 41:03.128
You hooked up with Ike
in my apartment!

41:03.161 --> 41:04.195
It's not a big deal.

41:04.229 --> 41:05.864
It's a big deal to me.
It just...

41:05.897 --> 41:08.033
happened, okay?
Ew.

41:08.066 --> 41:09.535
And Jason...

41:09.568 --> 41:10.802
Jason?
...is a great guy.

41:10.836 --> 41:12.103
Oh, is he?

41:12.137 --> 41:14.039
He took a bullet for you.

41:14.072 --> 41:15.240
(chuckles):
Oh, did he?

41:15.273 --> 41:16.908
I think that's a little generous

41:16.942 --> 41:18.577
with the interpretation
there, Ike.

41:18.610 --> 41:20.579
God! Ugh!

41:20.612 --> 41:22.180
And that was one of
my favorite shirts, too, man.

41:22.213 --> 41:23.549
I'll replace it.
No, you know what,

41:23.582 --> 41:24.850
I'm leaving the apartment
for 30 minutes.

41:24.883 --> 41:26.918
I want everything bleached!

41:26.952 --> 41:29.254
And I want the
sheets cleaned.

41:29.287 --> 41:30.756
Actually, just burn the sheets.

41:30.789 --> 41:32.991
And you know what,
if this is becoming a thing,

41:33.024 --> 41:34.926
you call him Ike.

41:37.062 --> 41:38.263
(door slams)

41:38.296 --> 41:41.166
BRIAN: While Ike and Rachel
erased their... everything

41:41.199 --> 41:44.302
from my apartment, I tried
to erase the thought of them

41:44.335 --> 41:45.804
from my mind
with a little light reading

41:45.837 --> 41:47.806
that I had borrowed
from Huston's burn book.

41:47.839 --> 41:49.841
*

41:55.080 --> 41:57.583
Eddie Morra used NZT
to go from a nobody

41:57.616 --> 41:59.284
to a candidate for president.

41:59.317 --> 42:03.121
But in those days, NZT wasn't
as hard to find as it is now.

42:03.154 --> 42:05.156
He needed to keep it
all to himself.

42:07.025 --> 42:11.329
And there were clusters of NZT
all over New York City.

42:11.362 --> 42:14.633
And men like Huston and Sands
knew what to do.

42:14.666 --> 42:17.936
First, they got rid
of the dealers.

42:17.969 --> 42:20.305
Then they ran down
the stray dogs--

42:20.338 --> 42:24.710
users with names like
Marcus Tate and Susan Epstein.

42:24.743 --> 42:27.779
Names like Conrad Harris,
Rebecca's father.

42:30.649 --> 42:32.618
They got rid of them all.

42:32.651 --> 42:35.621
Sands killed Rebecca's father.
