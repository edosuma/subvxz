WEBVTT

00:04.605 --> 00:07.573
The new, superior Death Star!

00:07.608 --> 00:10.175
Soon it will be complete.

00:10.211 --> 00:12.611
With its destructive power
at our command,

00:12.646 --> 00:16.114
we shall crush the Rebels
once and for all!

00:16.149 --> 00:18.150
- Meh.
- Meh?

00:18.185 --> 00:20.597
Meh! Don't get me wrong,
Lord Vader.

00:20.621 --> 00:24.323
I'm all for ruling the galaxy.
That's my thing!

00:24.358 --> 00:28.460
But you remember what happened
to the first Death Star?

00:28.496 --> 00:33.198
Yes, I was... there.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.200
Oh, right. You were.

00:35.236 --> 00:37.169
- Let's go to the replay!

00:39.173 --> 00:41.140
Is this really necessary?

00:43.244 --> 00:45.244
I have you now.

00:46.647 --> 00:48.614
- What?
- Ya-hoo!

00:48.649 --> 00:52.484
You're all clear, kid! Now let's
blow this thing and go home!

00:54.221 --> 00:57.523
"I have you now!"

00:58.526 --> 01:01.326
Ah, gets me every time.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.328
Nobody could have
anticipated that!

01:03.364 --> 01:07.299
Perhaps you can see why I
might want a plan B, Vader.

01:07.334 --> 01:09.401
Dooku always had a plan B.

01:09.437 --> 01:11.336
How's that?
Nothing. Continue.

01:11.372 --> 01:15.107
Impress me! He's not
going to impress me.

01:15.142 --> 01:20.512
Master, we recently uncovered something
of interest in the Jedi archives...

01:22.183 --> 01:23.582
The Kyber Saber.

01:23.617 --> 01:26.552
Ooh!
Emperor likey.

01:26.587 --> 01:29.121
What's it do?
Don't care. I want it.

01:29.156 --> 01:31.523
Gimme, gimme, gimme!
One small problem.

01:31.559 --> 01:33.525
Oh, here it comes.

01:33.561 --> 01:37.362
We don't exactly
know where it is.

01:37.398 --> 01:40.299
Ugh! But our forces are
scouring the galaxy.

01:40.334 --> 01:42.501
The Kyber Saber will be found.

01:42.536 --> 01:45.471
It better be, Lord Vader.

01:45.506 --> 01:48.373
And soon.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:59.420 --> 02:02.254
Lock S-foils
in attack position.

02:04.325 --> 02:07.359
Focus all fire on that
Imperial Assault Carrier!

02:13.134 --> 02:16.101
I've got one on my tail!
I can't shake him.

02:16.137 --> 02:19.238
- One less Rebel.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.508
Oh. Thanks, Wedge!

02:22.543 --> 02:24.143
Aaah!

02:30.484 --> 02:32.584
Whoo-hoo!
Sweet, sweet salvage!

02:32.620 --> 02:36.522
What do we got? Some energy
collection coils, ion jets.

02:36.557 --> 02:39.458
- Ready with the scoop.
- And ready on the cannon!

02:39.493 --> 02:41.393
No, Rowan. No cannon!

02:41.428 --> 02:44.429
Let them shoot at each other. We
don't want them shooting at us.

02:44.465 --> 02:46.198
Aw.

02:53.174 --> 02:55.274
I still think
this is a bad idea, Kordi.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.220
Salvaging in the middle
of a battle?

02:57.244 --> 02:59.178
It's a great idea, Zander.

02:59.213 --> 03:01.513
A battle is the best place
to find fresh parts.

03:01.549 --> 03:04.449
And we need parts
if we're gonna pay Furlac.

03:04.485 --> 03:06.084
Ooh! S-foils!

03:06.120 --> 03:09.087
Besides, those fighters are too
busy blowing each other up

03:09.123 --> 03:11.557
to notice little ol' us anyway.

03:11.592 --> 03:14.493
The Imperial defenses
are too tight! Retreat!

03:14.528 --> 03:17.462
The Rebels are breaking off
the attack. Stay in pursuit.

03:21.502 --> 03:24.303
Aw, missed the power converters!
Blast!

03:24.338 --> 03:27.239
- "Blast"?
- Rowan, no!

03:31.212 --> 03:33.245
Oops.
Think they'll notice?

03:33.280 --> 03:36.215
Great shot!
Who did that?

03:36.250 --> 03:38.150
Not me, boss.
Me neither.

03:38.185 --> 03:40.586
- Then who was it?
- Over there!

03:43.524 --> 03:46.124
They're noticing.
Time to go!

03:53.467 --> 03:56.501
Sorry about that, guys.
Hey, forget it, Rowan.

03:56.537 --> 04:00.372
Salvaging in the middle of a
battle was a bad idea anyway.

04:00.407 --> 04:03.175
Uh, I said that.
Did you?

04:08.349 --> 04:10.282
Ah, the Wheel.

04:10.317 --> 04:12.251
Home, sweet home.

04:16.589 --> 04:19.558
- Hold on.
- A block droid?

04:19.593 --> 04:22.594
Furlac, that scum weasel!

04:22.630 --> 04:25.130
<i>Hello, Freemakers!</i>

04:25.165 --> 04:27.499
Hello, Furlac.

04:27.534 --> 04:31.470
<i>I warned you... Pay your
rent, or I'll lock you out.</i>

04:31.505 --> 04:34.473
We just picked up some
top-class salvage, Furlac.

04:34.508 --> 04:38.277
But we can't sell it
without a shop.

04:38.312 --> 04:41.346
<i>Oh, Kordi, you know
my character flaw...</i>

04:41.382 --> 04:44.316
<i>I'm too generous.</i>

04:44.351 --> 04:50.122
<i>Fine. I give you
one extra day to pay me</i>

04:50.157 --> 04:53.191
<i>before I throw you all
out the airlock.</i>

05:07.441 --> 05:10.509
Okay, but how are we gonna
make the rent in one day?

05:10.544 --> 05:14.346
We've got no ships to repair
and no ships ready to sell.

05:14.381 --> 05:15.414
So we'll make a ship.

05:19.386 --> 05:21.320
Got an X-wing
turbo impeller.

05:21.355 --> 05:23.300
Here's a TIE power coupling.

05:23.324 --> 05:25.257
Here's a helmet.

05:25.292 --> 05:26.292
Ah.

05:26.327 --> 05:28.126
Rebel scum!

05:28.162 --> 05:30.529
Aaah!
Imperial swine!

05:31.598 --> 05:35.500
Hey. Hey!
No fighting in our shop!

05:35.536 --> 05:37.135
But we're fighter pilots!

05:37.171 --> 05:40.505
You know what? Take your
galactic conflict outside.

05:41.575 --> 05:43.475
Stop it.
You knock it off.

05:44.545 --> 05:47.446
Guys, I'm feeling
some inspiration.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.414
Stand back.

05:51.318 --> 05:54.286
Let me make sure your
inspiration can actually fly.

05:54.321 --> 05:56.399
- Can I help? -Ah, Rowan,
building requires focus.

05:56.423 --> 05:58.301
And I mean,
you're many things...

05:58.325 --> 06:02.160
A handsome kid, a decent singer
and an excellent little brother!

06:02.196 --> 06:04.096
But you're definitely
not focused.

06:04.131 --> 06:06.231
Oh. Sorry. I'm not what?

06:13.207 --> 06:15.507
- Oops.
- Oops. Again.

06:15.542 --> 06:18.510
What else have we got to sell?
Isn't that Ugly almost finished?

06:18.545 --> 06:23.482
Do not call my creations, my
life's work, my children "Uglies"!

06:23.517 --> 06:26.418
They are Z-wings.

06:26.453 --> 06:30.288
Shh. She didn't
mean it, baby.

06:30.357 --> 06:32.435
And yes, all she needs
is a thrust vector magnet.

06:32.459 --> 06:34.371
We get one of those, she'll fly.

06:34.395 --> 06:37.307
Weren't those mostly a
Clone Wars thing? Yep.

06:37.331 --> 06:39.364
Roger!
- What?

06:39.400 --> 06:42.167
I'm baking
sweet-sand cookies.

06:42.202 --> 06:45.203
Where was the worst battle
you ever saw in the Clone Wars?

06:45.239 --> 06:48.240
Oh, Nal Kapok.
No question.

06:48.275 --> 06:51.176
That's great! We'll find
the part we need there.

06:51.211 --> 06:53.111
Wait. What?
My cookies!

06:53.147 --> 06:55.547
I'm sure they're delicious,
but we've got to go.

07:04.558 --> 07:07.492
- We'll be back soon.
- Go nowhere, touch nothing.

07:07.528 --> 07:10.328
Talk to no one
with eight or more eyes.

07:10.364 --> 07:13.198
- But I wanted to go exploring.
- You can!

07:13.233 --> 07:15.367
<i>From inside the StarScavenger.</i>

07:15.402 --> 07:19.237
Look, as your big sister, I just
have to keep you safe, okay?

07:19.273 --> 07:22.174
And besides, you're way over
your "oops" limit for the day.

07:22.209 --> 07:26.111
- There's a limit? -Roger, don't
let him out of your sight.

07:26.146 --> 07:27.266
Roger, roger.

07:28.549 --> 07:31.516
They treat me like a kid.

07:31.552 --> 07:33.218
Imagine how I feel...

07:33.253 --> 07:37.088
Decorated veteran of the Clone
Wars demoted to babysitter.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.458
Okay, I wasn't decorated.
But still.

07:44.465 --> 07:47.432
There's somebody out there.

07:47.468 --> 07:50.302
- Stormtroopers?
- Those guys could be trouble.

07:50.337 --> 07:53.238
We should probably warn your siblings.
Right, Rowan?

07:53.273 --> 07:56.408
Rowan? Hey!
I'm supposed to watch you!

07:56.443 --> 07:58.410
Fine. Watch me run.

07:58.445 --> 08:01.146
Zander. Kordi.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.181
Oh. Where are you guys?

08:04.927 --> 08:06.960
Find anything?

08:06.995 --> 08:08.962
Bugs. Bugs.

08:08.997 --> 08:11.865
Some trees.
Bugs.

08:11.900 --> 08:14.234
Ugh, the boss won't be happy.

08:16.805 --> 08:18.238
Where'd they go?

08:18.273 --> 08:23.143
Slow down. My circuits
are overheating.

08:23.178 --> 08:25.145
- Do you hear that?
- Hear what?

08:25.180 --> 08:27.214
The sound of bad decisions
being made?

08:27.249 --> 08:30.083
Yeah, it's very loud.

08:30.118 --> 08:33.220
It's not a... sound.

08:33.255 --> 08:37.090
More of a... pull.

08:37.125 --> 08:40.126
Uh, the ship's back that way.

08:40.162 --> 08:42.929
Whoa!

08:42.965 --> 08:45.065
It's calling me.
What is?

08:45.100 --> 08:47.100
I'm not hearing anything.

08:47.135 --> 08:49.970
And not to brag, but I've got
excellent audio sensors.

08:52.841 --> 08:54.841
Waah!

08:56.011 --> 08:58.878
New coat of paint,
and I'll be fine.

08:58.947 --> 09:01.781
Thanks for your concern.
Rowan?

09:01.817 --> 09:06.119
You're behaving very
strangely, even for you.

09:06.154 --> 09:07.220
Waah!

09:09.191 --> 09:12.158
I have a bad feeling about this.

09:17.032 --> 09:18.164
Whoa!

09:18.200 --> 09:20.066
What is this thing?

09:20.102 --> 09:22.068
No idea.
Whoa.

09:22.104 --> 09:25.972
But we should put it back and run to
the ship before something really bad...

09:28.010 --> 09:31.878
Yeah, okay, not even
gonna finish that thought.

09:33.849 --> 09:34.849
Aaah! Dianoga!

09:41.657 --> 09:44.097
Good news. My programming doesn't
allow for "I told you so's"!

09:44.126 --> 09:45.659
Lucky me.

09:48.030 --> 09:49.663
Whoa. Whoa!

09:53.702 --> 09:56.936
- Whoa.

09:56.972 --> 09:59.973
- Stop!
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

10:02.010 --> 10:04.844
Hah! Yes! That...

10:04.880 --> 10:06.880
Didn't work at all.

10:17.893 --> 10:19.859
Whoa!

10:24.166 --> 10:27.734
- Are you okay, young one?
- Whoa!

10:27.769 --> 10:31.705
Is that a... laser sword? I've
never seen one! Can I hold it?

10:31.740 --> 10:36.976
- I'd like to hold it. When can I hold it?
- It's called a lightsaber.

10:37.012 --> 10:39.057
And maybe after
I know your name.

10:39.081 --> 10:42.048
Oh, hi. Sorry.
I'm Rowan Freemaker.

10:42.084 --> 10:45.018
And this is Roger.
My name is Naare.

10:45.053 --> 10:47.887
Quick question...
Are you a Jedi?

10:47.923 --> 10:49.956
- One of the few left.
- Thought so.

10:49.991 --> 10:52.959
Jedi!

10:54.963 --> 10:59.699
Jedi and battle droids weren't exactly
friends during the Clone Wars.

10:59.735 --> 11:00.900
No, we were not.

11:01.837 --> 11:04.637
What's a... Jedi?

11:04.673 --> 11:08.708
Many years ago, the Jedi were the
galaxy's guardians of peace and...

11:08.744 --> 11:11.644
Can I hold your lightsaber now?

11:11.680 --> 11:13.079
Patience.

11:13.115 --> 11:16.716
First, tell me,
how did you find this?

11:16.752 --> 11:18.696
Well, you're gonna
call me crazy.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.053
Crazy!

11:20.088 --> 11:23.022
But... it called to me.

11:23.058 --> 11:25.992
I don't even know
what it is. Do you?

11:26.027 --> 11:29.028
Why, yes, I do.

11:29.064 --> 11:31.998
Rusted.

11:32.033 --> 11:34.834
Like all the garbage
on this planet.

11:34.870 --> 11:36.770
We're running out of time.

11:36.805 --> 11:37.982
What about that troop transport?

11:38.006 --> 11:39.917
That thing looks almost new.

11:39.941 --> 11:42.742
- Might be our lucky day.

11:42.778 --> 11:44.811
Keep pulling!

11:44.846 --> 11:46.679
Almost got it!

11:48.817 --> 11:51.084
Good condition, no rust.

11:51.119 --> 11:54.687
Hard to believe this is old enough
to have been in the Clone Wars.

11:54.723 --> 11:58.057
It's not!
- Oh, hey, guys.

11:58.093 --> 12:00.026
Is this yours?
I was just holding it.

12:00.061 --> 12:01.995
You can have it... back.

12:02.030 --> 12:05.999
Millennia ago,
before even the Old Republic,

12:06.034 --> 12:08.802
there was a wise Jedi,

12:09.070 --> 12:11.838
<i>Master Baird Kantoo.</i>

12:11.873 --> 12:15.809
<i>Master Kantoo wanted to create
a weapon worthy of the Jedi.</i>

12:15.844 --> 12:17.944
<i>Using a skill known only to him,</i>

12:17.979 --> 12:21.881
<i>he forged kyber crystals
into one solid blade.</i>

12:25.720 --> 12:29.122
This was
the very first lightsaber.

12:35.730 --> 12:38.131
On your feet, thief!

12:38.166 --> 12:40.667
Is there a problem
here, trooper?

12:40.702 --> 12:44.037
Let me answer that for you.
There is, and his name is you!

12:44.072 --> 12:47.106
Imperial Inspector OU812.
Answer this...

12:47.142 --> 12:49.943
How is it that two
civilians, dressed like us,

12:49.978 --> 12:52.879
were able to wander right in
the middle of your operation

12:52.914 --> 12:54.859
and swipe a part
off your own transport?

12:54.883 --> 12:56.227
What's wrong with
how we're dressed?

12:56.251 --> 12:59.030
I'm gonna need operating numbers
from each and every one of you.

12:59.054 --> 13:01.921
The Emperor is going
to be very disappointed.

13:03.825 --> 13:05.792
"Licensed junk collector"?

13:05.827 --> 13:08.761
I know. They won't
let you retake the picture.

13:08.797 --> 13:10.663
Run, Zander!

13:10.699 --> 13:12.699
Running's a good plan!

13:14.803 --> 13:18.071
The Kyber Saber
was an impressive weapon.

13:18.106 --> 13:21.641
<i>It magnified Kantoo's powers
a thousandfold.</i>

13:47.736 --> 13:51.738
<i>When Kantoo realized the potential
danger of the Kyber Saber,</i>

13:51.773 --> 13:54.707
<i>he smashed his blade to pieces.</i>

13:59.748 --> 14:03.616
<i>He gave the Kyber Saber crystals
to trusted Jedi Knights</i>

14:03.652 --> 14:06.019
<i>to hide in distant corners
of the galaxy,</i>

14:06.054 --> 14:10.056
<i>so that no one would ever again
possess the power of the Kyber Saber.</i>

14:10.091 --> 14:14.994
Hyah! I'm Master
Kantoo, Jedi Knight!

14:15.030 --> 14:18.798
You're not listening. Yeah,
that's a problem with him.

14:18.833 --> 14:20.833
Hey, watch it!

14:20.869 --> 14:22.802
Sorry. Go on.

14:22.837 --> 14:24.804
Rowan, there is danger.

14:24.839 --> 14:27.874
Emperor Palpatine has learned
of the Kyber Saber.

14:27.909 --> 14:31.778
He may seem kind,
benevolent and wise...

14:31.813 --> 14:35.815
Actually, he seems creepy, clammy,
and his teeth are all weird.

14:35.850 --> 14:39.085
Oh, okay, yes.

14:39.120 --> 14:42.121
But worse, he's evil.

14:42.157 --> 14:44.090
Evil? Really?

14:44.125 --> 14:48.094
Yes, consumed by the
dark side of the Force.

14:48.129 --> 14:50.964
He will stop at nothing

14:50.999 --> 14:53.066
until he possesses
the Kyber Saber.

14:53.101 --> 14:57.904
That's what those stormtroopers
were looking for... this!

14:57.939 --> 14:59.973
The stormtroopers!

15:00.008 --> 15:01.841
I forgot all about them!

15:02.043 --> 15:03.943
Rowan! Wait!

15:03.979 --> 15:05.878
Come back!
See?

15:05.914 --> 15:08.781
Not a strong listener.
Aaah!

15:09.818 --> 15:11.818
They've got
my brother and sister.

15:11.853 --> 15:13.720
In the clutches of the Empire.

15:13.755 --> 15:15.800
They'll be sent to
the spice mines of Kessel.

15:15.824 --> 15:19.759
Or worse, they could be melted
into slag, fed to a Sarlacc,

15:19.794 --> 15:23.096
forced to clip
the Emperor's toenails!

15:23.164 --> 15:27.066
Should I activate silent mode now?
Roger, roger.

15:27.102 --> 15:29.852
I gotta save Kordi and Zander!

15:29.888 --> 15:32.889
Hyah! Whoa!

15:32.924 --> 15:35.870
Rowan, helping the
innocent is what Jedi do.

15:35.894 --> 15:38.895
- Let me help you.
- Um, okay.

15:38.930 --> 15:40.908
First, you'll need
a better weapon.

15:40.932 --> 15:42.832
Your lightsaber?

15:42.867 --> 15:45.702
- No.
- Blast!

15:45.737 --> 15:47.737
Hey!
What about that thing?

15:49.641 --> 15:53.643
Look, honestly, this
is one big misunderstanding.

15:53.678 --> 15:56.512
We had no idea you guys were here.
No idea.

15:56.548 --> 15:59.615
- No idea we were wandering into
your Imperial operation. -No idea!

15:59.651 --> 16:02.652
No idea this was Imperial property.
No idea at all!

16:02.687 --> 16:05.621
But since we are tax-paying
Imperial citizens,

16:05.657 --> 16:08.524
in a sense, that really
was our property.

16:09.627 --> 16:11.461
Am I right?

16:11.496 --> 16:13.536
- No idea what she's talking about.
- Zip it!

16:13.565 --> 16:16.899
Tell us what you know
about the Kyber Saber.

16:16.935 --> 16:19.836
What's a Kyber Saber?

16:28.947 --> 16:31.881
Oh, I like this!
Ha-ha!

16:31.916 --> 16:34.784
And I don't!

16:34.819 --> 16:37.687
Whoo! Fry or squish...
Your choice!

16:38.790 --> 16:40.690
Sorry.

16:40.725 --> 16:42.658
Yeah, you run!

16:42.694 --> 16:46.729
This is what happens when you
mess with the Freemakers!

16:46.765 --> 16:49.665
- Ha-ha!
- I like his enthusiasm.

16:52.637 --> 16:54.637
Whoa!

16:54.672 --> 16:57.473
Whoa!

16:58.543 --> 17:01.444
Aw! I was just
getting good.

17:02.881 --> 17:05.515
Uh-oh. Aaah!

17:07.551 --> 17:08.751
Ah!

17:14.893 --> 17:17.760
Aaah!

17:19.830 --> 17:21.664
Whoa.

17:25.770 --> 17:27.670
Ah.

17:31.609 --> 17:33.743
- Are you okay?
- I think so.

17:33.778 --> 17:37.713
<i>But two questions... one, why
aren't you in the StarScavenger?</i>

17:37.749 --> 17:40.483
- And two...
- Who is that?

17:40.518 --> 17:43.486
One, I just saved you.
You're welcome.

17:43.521 --> 17:45.922
And two, this is Naare.

17:45.957 --> 17:48.558
She's a Jedi!

17:49.961 --> 17:51.906
Weren't all the Jedi wiped out?

17:51.930 --> 17:54.497
Uh, they will be
if we don't leave now.

17:54.532 --> 17:57.867
The stormtroopers will return
soon, and in greater numbers.

17:57.902 --> 18:01.771
Well, the lady is more than
welcome to ride in our ship.

18:01.806 --> 18:05.708
A kind invitation,
but I have my own vessel.

18:12.784 --> 18:16.652
Ah, a beautiful ship
for a beautiful lady.

18:16.688 --> 18:18.588
Just fly.

18:20.024 --> 18:24.560
So no one would ever again possess
the power of the Kyber Saber.

18:24.596 --> 18:27.563
Wow. Nice story,
wonderfully told.

18:27.599 --> 18:32.468
But is it really a good idea to go
looking for these Kyber Saber crystals?

18:32.504 --> 18:34.570
I mean, that Jedi guy
hid them for a reason.

18:34.606 --> 18:36.506
The Emperor
has limitless resources.

18:36.541 --> 18:38.574
Sooner or later,
he will find them.

18:38.610 --> 18:41.444
Then, with the Kyber
Saber in hand...

18:41.479 --> 18:42.979
He'll be invincible.

18:43.014 --> 18:46.949
Fortunately, the Emperor lacks Rowan's
unique ability to sense the crystals.

18:46.985 --> 18:48.918
That is our advantage.

18:52.490 --> 18:56.759
I will train you to focus your
powers, to master the Force.

18:56.794 --> 18:58.761
Then you can lead us
to the crystals.

18:58.796 --> 19:01.664
And together, we can bring
true peace to the galaxy.

19:02.867 --> 19:06.736
That was a lot of words, and my
mind wandered in the middle.

19:06.771 --> 19:10.773
But I think you're saying...
I'm going to be a Jedi

19:10.808 --> 19:12.742
and have a lightsaber like you!

19:12.777 --> 19:15.545
Yes. Someday.

19:15.580 --> 19:19.715
Oh, please. Look, lady,
thank you for saving us,

19:19.751 --> 19:22.585
but I don't need you
filling my brothers' heads

19:22.620 --> 19:24.554
with all these dangerous ideas.

19:24.589 --> 19:26.667
You're right. Don't tell
me I'm... Wait. What?

19:26.691 --> 19:28.558
I'm... right?

19:28.593 --> 19:32.595
These are dangerous ideas
and dangerous times.

19:32.630 --> 19:36.499
I will stay close
to ensure Rowan's safety.

19:36.534 --> 19:38.467
Time's up, Freemakers!

19:38.503 --> 19:41.871
Furlac, please, just give us a
couple of hours to sell this Ugly.

19:41.906 --> 19:43.839
Z-wing.
And then we can...

19:43.875 --> 19:47.510
Uh-uh! No rent,
you're out the airlock.

19:47.545 --> 19:50.846
The Freemakers have paid
their rent in full.

19:50.882 --> 19:54.817
The Freemakers have paid
their rent in full.

19:54.852 --> 19:58.888
And I will rent the shop
across the way for one credit.

19:58.923 --> 20:04.827
And you will rent the shop across
the way for... one credit.

20:04.862 --> 20:07.841
The Force can have a powerful
effect on the weak-minded.

20:07.865 --> 20:10.800
The Force can have a powerful
effect on the weak-minded.

20:11.869 --> 20:14.670
Ah! No! Stop it!

20:16.674 --> 20:18.674
Let go!

20:20.745 --> 20:22.712
Sorry about Kordi.

20:22.747 --> 20:25.615
She's just crazy protective.

20:25.650 --> 20:27.650
Or maybe just crazy.

20:27.685 --> 20:29.730
She should be protective, Rowan.

20:29.754 --> 20:34.490
If the Emperor were to learn of your
connection to the Kyber Saber crystals...

20:34.525 --> 20:35.703
That would be bad.

20:35.727 --> 20:38.561
You may not know
who you can trust.

20:38.596 --> 20:41.597
Share your secret with no one.

20:42.634 --> 20:45.635
Uh, you better guard this then.

20:46.671 --> 20:49.538
I will protect it with my life.

20:49.574 --> 20:52.908
Now go get some rest. Tomorrow
we set out to save the galaxy.

20:52.944 --> 20:55.911
When do I get a lightsaber? Go.

21:03.554 --> 21:06.455
<i>Agent Naare!</i>

21:06.491 --> 21:08.858
<i>Explain your actions
on Nal Kapok.</i>

21:08.893 --> 21:11.727
<i>Oh! Is she there?
I want to talk to her!</i>

21:11.763 --> 21:13.829
<i>I'm handling it, Master.</i>

21:13.865 --> 21:15.898
<i>Yeah, like you handled
the Death Star?</i>

21:15.933 --> 21:19.869
<i>Naare, why did we give you a garrison
of perfectly good stormtroopers</i>

21:19.904 --> 21:21.949
<i>if you're just going to
cut them to shreds?</i>

21:21.973 --> 21:25.808
Because, my lord, I needed
to gain the trust of a boy

21:25.843 --> 21:28.778
who can lead me
to the Kyber Saber crystals.

21:28.813 --> 21:32.748
<i>What makes you believe this
boy possesses such a power?</i>

21:32.784 --> 21:36.686
This.
It "called" to him.

21:36.721 --> 21:39.889
<i>Ooh! Emperor likey.</i>

21:39.924 --> 21:41.924
<i>Good work, Naare.</i>

21:41.959 --> 21:44.727
<i>Yes, impressive.</i>

21:44.762 --> 21:47.763
<i>But... what if you lose
this boy's trust?</i>

21:49.901 --> 21:53.936
Then I'll use another
form of persuasion.
