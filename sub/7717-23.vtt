Why is pbs sending
another crew?

00:06.674 --> 00:08.640

Nobody buys dvds anymore.

A kind of
"where are they now" panel

00:34.201 --> 00:35.634
At a local theater.

- Mm-hmm.

01:15.209 --> 01:17.209
- What does that mean?

01:17.211 --> 01:18.444
- It's a colloquial way
of saying "you're fired," kevin,

01:18.446 --> 01:20.846
Which you are.
- What?

01:20.848 --> 01:22.448

ever been fired,

Now the chef special
sounded good.

[all cheering]

18:25.472 --> 18:28.473
Mose! What...

18:28.475 --> 18:30.842
Ohh, mose.

18:30.844 --> 18:32.543
- What the [bleep]
is your problem,

18:32.545 --> 18:35.379
You [bleep]
[bleep] [bleep]?

18:38.550 --> 18:41.519
- Hey.
Hey, is angela coming, or--

18:41.521 --> 18:43.454
- No. We can't see each other
on our wedding day.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.690
And her legs are still numb
from being in the trunk.

18:45.692 --> 18:47.391
- Right.
- Hey, guys.

18:47.393 --> 18:49.127
All: Stanley!

18:49.129 --> 18:51.896
- How's florida?
- Oh, great.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.631
Yes, I'm living
in florida now.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.466
Little town
called florida city,

18:55.468 --> 18:57.835
Just on the edge
of the everglades.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.570
The man who delivered
my divorce papers

18:59.572 --> 19:02.874
Came by fan boat,
which was kinda fun.

19:02.876 --> 19:06.911
I sit on my porch all day,
carving birds.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.679
- Am I the only one
that's nervous? Heh heh.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.781
How are you doing with this?
Should we have bailed?

19:10.783 --> 19:12.850
- No, no, I'm fine.

19:12.852 --> 19:16.787
- Doesn't seem like
anyone cares about us anyway.

19:16.789 --> 19:21.259
- I guess this was worth being
filmed nonstop for nine years.

19:21.261 --> 19:24.262
- I'm sorry, guys.
This is probably on me.

19:24.264 --> 19:27.265
I got hated on pretty hard
when that auto-tune went viral.

20:44.244 --> 20:46.510
- It's like seeing a documentary
about how your food is made.

20:46.512 --> 20:48.246
It's kinda disgusting.

20:48.248 --> 20:50.815
You learn a lot, but I didn't
wanna know any of it.

20:50.817 --> 20:53.618
- With today's modern
surveillance technology,

20:53.620 --> 20:57.588
We are in a constant state
of being watched,

20:57.590 --> 20:58.823
Whether
it's our government

20:58.825 --> 21:00.358
Or the government
of other countries,

21:00.360 --> 21:01.859
A.K.A. Google.

21:01.861 --> 21:04.795
You guys are being filmed
way more than we ever were.

21:04.797 --> 21:06.897
- Uh, no one recognizes me.

21:06.899 --> 21:08.899
But now all my friends
call me plop.

21:08.901 --> 21:11.902
So...Thanks, pbs.
[laughter]

21:11.904 --> 21:15.439
- Uh, jim, that dvd
in the last episode

21:15.441 --> 21:17.341
Was so romantic.

21:17.343 --> 21:19.577
And, um, I think
we'd all love to know,

21:19.579 --> 21:23.381
Pam, what romantic thing
did you do to pay jim back

21:23.383 --> 21:24.815
For leaving athlead?

21:24.817 --> 21:27.918
- Well, I mean, how do you
pay back someone

21:27.920 --> 21:30.321
For something like that?

21:30.323 --> 21:34.292
But, uh, I don't know.
I'm working on something.

21:34.294 --> 21:37.428
- She pays me back every day,
just by being my wife.

21:37.430 --> 21:38.596
So that's fine.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.665
All: Aww.

21:40.667 --> 21:42.600
- O-kay.

21:42.602 --> 21:45.770
- All I can say is,
if I had jim,

21:45.772 --> 21:48.472
He would have a free pass
to do anything.

21:48.474 --> 21:51.642
I mean,
if I lucked into that,

21:51.644 --> 21:53.611
He could do anything--

21:53.613 --> 21:55.413
<i>Anything.</i>

21:55.415 --> 21:58.749
- I'm sorry,
is there a question?

21:58.751 --> 22:02.653
- Uh, no.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.555
- Pam, what was in
that teapot letter?

22:04.557 --> 22:07.591
- Oh, um,
well, you know, I--

22:07.593 --> 22:10.728
I just--I think I would rather
keep that private.

22:10.730 --> 22:13.431
You know, if you'd been filmed
for nine years of your life,

22:13.433 --> 22:16.000
There'd be some things that you
just wanna keep to yourself.

22:16.002 --> 22:19.837
- I hear ya.
What did it say?

22:19.839 --> 22:21.339
- We're gonna move on.

22:21.341 --> 22:22.606
Next question, please.

22:22.608 --> 22:24.975
- Do you find that your life
feels pointless

22:24.977 --> 22:27.645
Now that nobody's actually
filming you anymore?

22:27.647 --> 22:29.580
- Yes.

22:32.050 --> 22:34.819
- I wanna know how everyone
felt they were portrayed.

22:34.821 --> 22:37.388
Was it accurate?
- I got a beef with that.

22:37.390 --> 22:39.590
Um, for the first
seven years,

22:39.592 --> 22:41.592
I was getting my phd
in school psychology,

22:41.594 --> 22:42.960
And they didn't show it.

22:42.962 --> 22:44.695
Yes, I was getting hammered.

22:44.697 --> 22:49.967
But, hey, it was college.

22:49.969 --> 22:51.869
- I have a question
for jim and pam.

22:51.871 --> 22:55.373
Everyone watching sees
how much you love each other

22:55.375 --> 22:57.441
And how you're soul mates.

22:57.443 --> 22:59.877
So, pam,
how could you doubt that

22:59.879 --> 23:02.046
When jim moved
to philadelphia?

23:02.048 --> 23:05.583
- Um, you know what, I actually
didn't handle that move, uh,

23:05.585 --> 23:06.984
Very gracefully,

23:06.986 --> 23:10.621
From not communicating
to being a little selfish.

23:10.623 --> 23:12.556
- Listen, um...

23:12.558 --> 23:15.693
I was scared, you know?

23:15.695 --> 23:18.129
I loved what I had,
and I didn't wanna risk it.

23:18.131 --> 23:22.800
And I think that maybe
I did doubt him a little too.

23:22.802 --> 23:24.668
Which was wrong,

23:24.670 --> 23:27.538
Because he's shown me
time and again.

23:27.540 --> 23:29.440
But when the documentary
started airing,

23:29.442 --> 23:30.641
People on the street told me

23:30.643 --> 23:33.511
That I had
this fairy-tale romance.

23:33.513 --> 23:35.413
But there were
a lot of times last year

23:35.415 --> 23:37.615
When it did not feel
like a fairy tale.

23:37.617 --> 23:42.119
But then it got deeper,
and it got stronger,

23:42.121 --> 23:44.922
And now it's better
than a fairy tale.

23:44.924 --> 23:49.593
It's like a long book
that you never want to end.

23:49.595 --> 23:50.895
And you're fine with that,

23:50.897 --> 23:53.964
Because you just never, ever
wanna leave it.

23:53.966 --> 23:55.599
All: Aww.

23:55.601 --> 23:57.201
- Like <i>harry potter.</i>

23:57.203 --> 24:00.638
- Yeah, like <i>harry potter.</i>

24:00.640 --> 24:03.641
- I have a question
for erin.

24:03.643 --> 24:05.576
- Really?
- Yes.

24:05.578 --> 24:08.646
Um, the thing I found
most compelling

24:08.648 --> 24:13.584
About the documentary was your
search for your birth mother.

24:13.586 --> 24:15.719
- Thank you.

24:15.721 --> 24:20.658
- So my question is,
um, do--don't you hate her?

24:20.660 --> 24:24.462
I mean, I would just imagine
that you were so angry at her

24:24.464 --> 24:27.932
That you would hate her.

24:27.934 --> 24:29.600
- Maybe sometimes.

24:29.602 --> 24:32.570
But not like <i>hate</i> hate.

24:32.572 --> 24:36.207
More just like,
"mom, I hate you!"

24:36.209 --> 24:40.144
And then she would say,
"go to your room, young lady."

24:40.146 --> 24:42.646
And I'd stamp my foot
and run upstairs.

24:42.648 --> 24:45.649
And I have a room,
which is really cool.

24:45.651 --> 24:48.519
And then we'd just
have dinner together.

24:48.521 --> 24:49.820
But I don't know.
I'd have to meet her.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.555
[laughs]
thanks.

24:54.693 --> 24:56.861
- Erin...

24:56.863 --> 24:59.864
- Yes?

24:59.866 --> 25:01.665
- Um...

25:01.667 --> 25:06.637
Oh, erin...

25:06.639 --> 25:12.076
- Yes?
Is there a follow-up question?

25:16.548 --> 25:20.684
Mom?

25:20.686 --> 25:22.520
All: Aww.

25:22.522 --> 25:25.589
[applause]

25:30.962 --> 25:33.564
- Erin...

25:33.566 --> 25:36.634
Same question,
but about your dad?

25:42.574 --> 25:45.242

a good place to stop.

28:12.580 --> 28:14.246
So I was dating this girl,
and one day,

28:14.248 --> 28:16.148
She went out
to get a new charger

28:16.150 --> 28:17.449

aren't too high.

40:27.247 --> 40:29.781
Which is the history of us.

40:29.783 --> 40:31.983
All of us.

40:31.985 --> 40:33.952
And this is for you, jim.

40:33.954 --> 40:36.788
[applause]
and go ahead!

40:38.057 --> 40:40.425
[all cheering]

40:44.797 --> 40:48.233
Everyone, let's take our picture
in front of the mural.

40:57.042 --> 40:58.343
Oh, um, I just--

40:58.345 --> 41:00.078
I kind of meant
just everybody from the office.

41:00.080 --> 41:02.981
[laughter]

41:02.983 --> 41:07.051
[shutter clicking]

41:07.053 --> 41:07.952
- Very nice.

41:07.954 --> 41:11.022
Just a couple dozen more.

41:11.024 --> 41:13.925
Smiles, everybody,
smiles.

41:15.895 --> 41:17.362
All right, that's great.
I got enough.

41:17.364 --> 41:19.964
Thank you, everybody.

41:23.502 --> 41:25.403
- Let's go outside.
- Okay.

41:25.405 --> 41:27.839
[indistinct chatter]

41:33.345 --> 41:35.446
- Yeah, we all need a drink.

41:35.448 --> 41:37.448
What the--

41:37.450 --> 41:40.885
There's only dandelion tea
and raisins in here.

41:40.887 --> 41:43.021
- Hey...
Bottom drawer.

41:44.390 --> 41:46.891
- Yes!

41:46.893 --> 41:49.594
[phone ringing]

41:49.596 --> 41:50.829
- Oh, so...
- Mm-hmm.

41:50.831 --> 41:53.298
- Right.

41:58.137 --> 42:00.605
- Dunder mifflin,
this is pam.

42:00.607 --> 42:02.340
Oh, I'm sorry.

42:02.342 --> 42:07.011
Jim halpert
doesn't work here anymore.

42:09.281 --> 42:12.150
I didn't watch
the whole documentary.

42:12.152 --> 42:14.085
After a few episodes,
it was too painful.

42:14.087 --> 42:16.621
I kept wanting to scream
at pam.

42:16.623 --> 42:20.258
It took me so long
to do so many important things.

42:20.260 --> 42:23.027
It's just hard to accept
that I spent so many years

42:23.029 --> 42:25.029
Being less happy
than I could've been.

42:25.031 --> 42:28.900
Jim was 5 feet
from my desk,

42:28.902 --> 42:31.135
And it took me four years
to get to him.

42:31.137 --> 42:33.571
It'd be great
if people saw this documentary

42:33.573 --> 42:35.573
And learned from my mistakes.

42:35.575 --> 42:38.910
Not that I'm a tragic person.
I'm really happy now.

42:38.912 --> 42:41.346
But...

42:41.348 --> 42:44.182
It would just--
just make my heart soar

42:44.184 --> 42:46.584
If someone out there
saw this

42:46.586 --> 42:48.653
And she said to herself,

42:48.655 --> 42:50.421
"be strong.

42:50.423 --> 42:52.590
"trust yourself,
love yourself.

42:52.592 --> 42:54.459
"conquer your fears.

42:54.461 --> 42:56.628
"just go
after what you want.

42:56.630 --> 43:01.399
And act fast, because life
just isn't that long."

43:01.401 --> 43:04.035
- If there is one thing
that I have learned

43:04.037 --> 43:06.571
Through
this whole experience...

43:06.573 --> 43:08.172
[cheering]
it's that...

43:08.174 --> 43:12.343
If you film anybody
long enough,

43:12.345 --> 43:16.014
They're going to do
something stupid.

43:16.016 --> 43:20.518
[all whooping]
it's only human natural.

43:20.520 --> 43:21.686
- Hey, guys.

43:21.688 --> 43:24.689
- Hi.
All: Hey!

43:24.691 --> 43:26.591
- What about the honeymoon?

43:26.593 --> 43:28.493
- Oh, the honeymoon
can wait till tomorrow.

43:28.495 --> 43:30.094
We wanted to hang out
with you guys.

43:30.096 --> 43:33.164
I mean, when are we all
going to be here together again?

43:33.166 --> 43:34.699
- Aw.

43:34.701 --> 43:36.567
J, p, and d.
The three amigos.

43:36.569 --> 43:37.669
Ah, it warms my heart.

43:37.671 --> 43:39.237
Hey, what do you say,

43:39.239 --> 43:40.705
When I get back
from our honeymoon,

43:40.707 --> 43:42.240
The three of us
have a conference room meeting

43:42.242 --> 43:44.709
Just for fun?

43:44.711 --> 43:47.378
What is that meaningful look?

43:47.380 --> 43:50.315
- You know what?
Maybe we should talk.

43:50.317 --> 43:53.418
- Hey, come here.
You guys need to see this.

43:53.420 --> 43:54.686
- What is it?

43:54.688 --> 43:56.487
- You're probably
sitting there wondering

43:56.489 --> 44:00.224
What will be your mark,
what will you be known for?

44:00.226 --> 44:02.126
It might surprise you
to learn--

44:02.128 --> 44:04.996
- I finally feel ready.
Athlead is growing.

44:04.998 --> 44:06.331
- Athleap.

44:06.333 --> 44:08.433
- And jim can jump back in
without skipping a beat.

44:08.435 --> 44:10.268
We'll come back to visit.

44:10.270 --> 44:12.470
But I think it's time
for us to officially--

44:12.472 --> 44:14.105
- No, don't say it.
You're fired!

44:14.107 --> 44:15.473
You're both fired!
- Dwight, come on.

44:15.475 --> 44:17.108
Don't end on a bad note.

44:17.110 --> 44:19.010
- Don't be an idiot.
It's for the severance.

44:19.012 --> 44:20.445
The best that I can do

44:20.447 --> 44:21.646
Is one month for every year
you've been here.

44:21.648 --> 44:24.282
That's the max.

44:24.284 --> 44:26.451
- Thanks, dwight.

44:26.453 --> 44:29.287
- Hey, and if you're ever
in austin--

44:29.289 --> 44:31.122
- Whoa. Right.
For what, the art?

44:31.124 --> 44:33.491
The music?
The incredible nightlife?

44:33.493 --> 44:34.726
No, thank you.

44:34.728 --> 44:36.427
But if you're ever
in the area,

44:36.429 --> 44:38.296
You'll always have
a place to stay.

44:38.298 --> 44:39.764
In my barn.

44:39.766 --> 44:41.733
- There it is.

44:41.735 --> 44:44.002
- Do I get along
with my co-workers?

44:44.004 --> 44:46.637
Well, first of all,
I don't have co-workers anymore.

44:46.639 --> 44:48.406
I have subordinates.

44:48.408 --> 44:49.707
So...

44:49.709 --> 44:51.743
Have I gotten along
with my subordinates?

44:51.745 --> 44:53.678
Let's see.

44:53.680 --> 44:56.280
My supplier relations rep,
meredith palmer,

44:56.282 --> 44:58.583
Is the only person I know who
knows how to properly head bang

44:58.585 --> 45:01.519
To motorhead.

45:01.521 --> 45:05.490
Oscar martinez, my accountant,
is now godfather to my son.

45:05.492 --> 45:07.425
Angela schrute,
my former accountant,

45:07.427 --> 45:09.727
Is now my wife.

45:09.729 --> 45:12.030
My top salesman jim halpert
was best man at my wedding.

45:12.032 --> 45:15.033
And office administrator
pamela beesly halpert

45:15.035 --> 45:16.634
Is my best friend.

45:16.636 --> 45:17.769
So...

45:17.771 --> 45:19.704
Yes.

45:19.706 --> 45:23.174
I'd say I have gotten along
with my subordinates.

45:23.176 --> 45:25.576
- You might
feel sorry for me.

45:25.578 --> 45:27.812
But I actually
feel sorry for you.

45:27.814 --> 45:30.515
Because you're about
to leave cornell.

45:30.517 --> 45:31.783
So say it with me.

45:31.785 --> 45:35.820
All: Oh, I can so
just sit here and cry.

45:35.822 --> 45:36.821
[cheers and applause]

45:36.823 --> 45:39.657
- Oh, yes!

45:39.659 --> 45:41.826
- You did good.
Real good.

45:41.828 --> 45:44.228
- Thanks, dad--
darryl.

45:44.230 --> 45:47.832
I spent so much of my time
here at dunder mifflin

45:47.834 --> 45:49.600
Thinking about my old pals,

45:49.602 --> 45:51.536
My college a cappella group.

45:51.538 --> 45:54.138
The weird thing is...

45:54.140 --> 45:56.140
Now, I'm exactly
where I wanna be.

45:56.142 --> 45:59.644
I got my dream job
at cornell,

45:59.646 --> 46:02.747
And I'm still just thinking
about my old pals.

46:02.749 --> 46:06.250
Only now they're the ones
I made here.

46:06.252 --> 46:10.721
I wish there was a way to know
you're in the good old days

46:10.723 --> 46:13.791
Before you've actually
left them.

46:16.829 --> 46:20.131
Someone should write a song
about that.

46:20.133 --> 46:24.836
- You take something ordinary,
like a piece of paper.

46:24.838 --> 46:26.804
It's not much.

46:26.806 --> 46:29.874
But if you see it

46:29.876 --> 46:33.277
In the right way--

46:33.279 --> 46:37.582
And that's what you did
with this documentary.

46:37.584 --> 46:39.550
But seriously, you made
a nine-year documentary,

46:39.552 --> 46:42.553
And you couldn't once
show me doing my origami.

46:42.555 --> 46:46.190
[laughter]

46:48.260 --> 46:51.796

How did you capture

48:48.615 --> 48:51.782
How we felt and how we made
each other laugh

48:51.784 --> 48:53.684
And how we got
through the day?

48:53.686 --> 48:55.786
How did you do it?

48:55.788 --> 48:57.855
Also, how do cameras work?

48:57.857 --> 48:59.757
- Every day
when I came into work,

48:59.759 --> 49:02.860
All I wanted to do
was leave.

49:02.862 --> 49:05.796
So why in the world does it feel
so hard to leave right now?

49:05.798 --> 49:08.566
- It all seems
so very arbitrary.

49:08.568 --> 49:11.302
I applied for a job
at this company

49:11.304 --> 49:12.970
Because they were hiring.

49:12.972 --> 49:14.839
I took a desk at the back

49:14.841 --> 49:16.807
Because it was empty.

49:16.809 --> 49:18.876
But...
[chuckles]

49:18.878 --> 49:22.346
No matter how you get there
or where you end up,

49:22.348 --> 49:25.283
Human beings have
this miraculous gift

49:25.285 --> 49:28.853
To make that place home.

49:36.028 --> 49:38.562
Let's do this.

49:39.965 --> 49:42.633

that I got a chance to share

they're the only one

To take a dump
in a paper shredder.

You're not alone, sister.

50:01.020 --> 50:04.088
So I can remember everyone
and what we did.

50:05.824 --> 50:07.725
I worked for a paper company
all these years,

50:07.727 --> 50:11.696
And I never wrote
anything down.

50:11.698 --> 50:13.664
- That was so much fun.

[indistinct chatter]

50:14.734 --> 50:16.033
- Bye, kev!

50:16.035 --> 50:18.336
- I sold paper at this company
for 12 years.

50:18.338 --> 50:20.838
My job was to speak
to clients on the phone

50:20.840 --> 50:23.841
About quantities
and types of copier paper.

50:23.843 --> 50:27.878
Even if I didn't love
every minute of it,

50:27.880 --> 50:33.718
Everything I have,
I owe to this job.

50:33.720 --> 50:35.786
This stupid...

50:35.788 --> 50:38.522
Wonderful...

50:38.524 --> 50:40.725
Boring...

50:40.727 --> 50:43.561
Amazing job.

50:43.563 --> 50:46.997
- I thought it was weird
when you picked us

50:46.999 --> 50:49.567
To make a documentary.

50:49.569 --> 50:52.536
But all in all...

50:52.538 --> 50:55.806
I think an ordinary paper
company like dunder mifflin

50:55.808 --> 50:59.877
Was a great subject
for a documentary.

50:59.879 --> 51:03.714
There's a lot of beauty
in ordinary things.

51:03.716 --> 51:06.784
Isn't that
kind of the point?
