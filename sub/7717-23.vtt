WEBVTT

00:05.171 --> 00:06.672
- The documentary series
finished airing ages ago.
Why is pbs sending
another crew?

00:06.674 --> 00:08.640
- We're getting bonus footage
for the dvd.

00:08.642 --> 00:11.477
- Pfft.
Nobody buys dvds anymore.

00:11.479 --> 00:13.212
- It'll be a pledge gift.

00:13.214 --> 00:15.080
- Pbs.

00:15.082 --> 00:17.216
The propaganda wing
of bill and melinda gates

00:17.218 --> 00:19.485
And viewers like you.

00:19.487 --> 00:21.320
In the past year,

00:21.322 --> 00:23.288
I have consolidated the entire
scranton paper market,

00:23.290 --> 00:25.190
We regained the white pages,

00:25.192 --> 00:26.592
The school district,
lackawanna county.

00:26.594 --> 00:28.293
We supply them all.

00:28.295 --> 00:30.195
I'm getting married
tomorrow afternoon,

00:30.197 --> 00:32.297
And in the morning,
there's a mini reunion--

00:32.299 --> 00:34.199
A kind of
"where are they now" panel

00:34.201 --> 00:35.634
At a local theater.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.336
It'll be nice
to see everyone again.

00:37.338 --> 00:41.373
[laughs] I haven't seen kevin
since we let him go.

00:41.375 --> 00:44.610
[mimicking trumpet]

00:44.612 --> 00:48.347
Today marks several
important milestones.

00:48.349 --> 00:52.051
Stanley, as you know,
is retiring.

00:52.053 --> 00:53.285
- [laughing]

00:53.287 --> 00:55.454
- Yes.
Whoo, whoo, whoo.

00:55.456 --> 00:57.289
- Ah, I've been looking forward
to this day

00:57.291 --> 00:59.058
Since I was 18 years old.

00:59.060 --> 01:00.392
- Speech!
- No!

01:00.394 --> 01:04.196
And our next
and most thickly frosted cake

01:04.198 --> 01:07.066
Is...For...Kevin.

01:07.068 --> 01:09.234
- Yes!
- [laughing]

01:09.236 --> 01:10.335
- Wait, why?

01:10.337 --> 01:13.772
- Go ahead and just read
the frosting.

01:13.774 --> 01:15.207
- "get out"?
- Mm-hmm.

01:15.209 --> 01:17.209
- What does that mean?

01:17.211 --> 01:18.444
- It's a colloquial way
of saying "you're fired," kevin,

01:18.446 --> 01:20.846
Which you are.
- What?

01:20.848 --> 01:22.448
Dwight you can't do that.

01:22.450 --> 01:25.150
- The cake has spoken, pam.
Sorry! Heh.

01:25.152 --> 01:28.554
Well, if anyone here can make
a case for kevin staying...

01:28.556 --> 01:29.555
- Dwight...

01:29.557 --> 01:31.290
[overlapping objections]

01:31.292 --> 01:33.459
- Based...
On his merit.

01:33.461 --> 01:36.395
- Ooh.

01:36.397 --> 01:38.130
- Um...

01:38.132 --> 01:40.799
- I'm...Good.

01:40.801 --> 01:42.401
- Well, toby'll stop it.

01:42.403 --> 01:44.236
Anytime anyone's
ever been fired,

01:44.238 --> 01:46.405
Toby's blocked it, so--
- yeah, yeah.

01:46.407 --> 01:47.739
I don't think--
- toby, wait, wait.

01:47.741 --> 01:50.209
Hold that thought.

01:50.211 --> 01:52.778
Here's your cake.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.481
Bye bye, toby.

01:56.416 --> 01:58.684
[kevin sniffling]

01:58.686 --> 02:04.323
- [crying]
at least I got chocolate.

02:04.325 --> 02:07.326
[cheerful music]

02:07.328 --> 02:15.400
â™ª

02:40.426 --> 02:42.327
- I bike to work now.

02:42.329 --> 02:44.630
Saves on gas,
cheaper than a vasectomy,

02:44.632 --> 02:46.832
And, uh, oh, yeah, it's good
for the environment too.

02:49.402 --> 02:50.702
Pam and I are great.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.271
She just recently
finished her mural

02:52.273 --> 02:53.672
For the irish cultural center.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.307
[cheers and applause]

02:55.309 --> 02:56.808
- Whoo!
- Can you clap?

02:56.810 --> 02:58.544
Can you clap for mom?

02:58.546 --> 03:01.847
- And dwight is imitating
japanese business practices

03:01.849 --> 03:05.384
For reasons he explained to us
in japanese.

03:05.386 --> 03:08.554
- [whispering] angela,
are you ready for the wedding?

03:08.556 --> 03:09.888
- Yes.

03:09.890 --> 03:12.257
My heart is so open.

03:12.259 --> 03:14.226
I am so at peace.

03:14.228 --> 03:17.429
[scoffs]
look at meredith.

03:17.431 --> 03:20.299
She's disgusting.
Those feet--

03:20.301 --> 03:22.401
They're like the paws
of an orangutan.

03:22.403 --> 03:23.735
- I think she looks good.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.304
Now that she's wearing
sports bras,

03:25.306 --> 03:26.838
We don't see her boobs
as much.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.407
- That is all.
Have a good morning.

03:28.409 --> 03:29.942
- Thank you.
- Thank you, dwight.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.279
- [laughing]
- what was that for?

03:34.281 --> 03:36.748
- To remind you that our
wedding's gonna be wonderful.

03:36.750 --> 03:39.718
- Ah, I know.
It just feels so empty with...

03:39.720 --> 03:41.286
So many of the old gang gone.

03:41.288 --> 03:43.689
- D, it's gonna be perfect.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.958
The only people that need
to be there are you and me.

03:45.960 --> 03:48.393
- Oh, and the old man
to feed us the cheese

03:48.395 --> 03:49.861
That he's been fermenting
since the day of my birth.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.330
You keep forgetting
about him.

03:51.332 --> 03:53.398
- I don't--
I don't know why.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.235
- I brought in
some new faces,

03:56.237 --> 03:57.336
And one old.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.004
I always liked devon.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.607
I hired him back
after creed faked his own death

04:01.609 --> 04:03.809
In the baler
the day after the doc aired.

04:03.811 --> 04:05.744
The only person he fooled
was kevin.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.346
Then the police showed up.

04:07.348 --> 04:08.647
Turns out,
creed was in the band

04:08.649 --> 04:11.283
The grass roots
in the 1960s.

04:11.285 --> 04:13.285
During that time,
the police say,

04:13.287 --> 04:17.789
He sold drugs and trafficked
in endangered species meat

04:17.791 --> 04:21.526
And stole weapons-grade lsd
from the military.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.998
- Oh, some fudge?
- Oh, thanks.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.699
I love your fudge.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.301
- Thanks.
- Mm.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.570
I think I gained a couple
pounds since I got here.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.772
- [laughing]
oh, you can afford it.

04:33.774 --> 04:37.276
After 16 years, it's strange
sitting across from somebody

04:37.278 --> 04:39.478
Who isn't stanley.

04:39.480 --> 04:43.582
But he'll get there.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.450
- Okay, the limo's
gonna be here at 5:00.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.452
I need everybody to be ready
'cause I want to pack in a lot.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.354
- Partytime whorehouse.

04:49.356 --> 04:51.290
- Uh, no. No whorehouse.
This is dwight's night, okay?

04:51.292 --> 04:52.991
- Well, you're
the bestisch mensch

04:52.993 --> 04:56.295
- Dwight has made me
his bestisch mensch.

04:56.297 --> 04:58.630
Which is schrute
for best man.

04:58.632 --> 05:01.066
He's putting himself
entirely in my hands tonight.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.868
And I know,
for over 12 years,

05:02.870 --> 05:05.304
I've done nothing but trick
and prank him.

05:05.306 --> 05:06.772
But tonight...

05:06.774 --> 05:09.374
Only good surprises.

05:09.376 --> 05:10.575
"guten pranken."

05:10.577 --> 05:12.010
[chuckles]

05:12.012 --> 05:13.578
- Oh, hey, jim,
I forgot mention.

05:13.580 --> 05:15.681
Oftentimes, in hollywood
portrayals of bachelor parties,

05:15.683 --> 05:17.049
There are accidental murders.

05:17.051 --> 05:19.384
That won't be necessary
tonight.

05:19.386 --> 05:20.485
- Great, now we got
three hours to fill.

05:20.487 --> 05:21.920
- Okay, hold on.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.422
Are you sure mose
isn't going to show up?

05:23.424 --> 05:24.890
- Ever since angela
moved in

05:24.892 --> 05:26.758
And mose had stopped sleeping
at the foot of my bed,

05:26.760 --> 05:28.660
He's been acting pretty weird
about this whole wedding thing.

05:28.662 --> 05:32.731
- Mose has been weird?
That's so unlike him.

05:32.733 --> 05:37.336
[indistinct chatter]

05:37.338 --> 05:42.341
[car horns]

05:46.546 --> 05:48.547
- Yeah, sure,
I'll talk about it.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.415
Why not?

05:50.417 --> 05:51.983
<i>America's next</i>
<i>a cappella sensation</i>

05:51.985 --> 05:53.685
Aired my audition.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.821
And when I started sobbing
uncontrollably,

05:55.823 --> 06:00.125
Apparently struck a chord
with quite a lot of people.

06:00.127 --> 06:03.128
Not a very
compassionate chord.

06:03.130 --> 06:06.431
The clip went viral,
as they say.

06:06.433 --> 06:07.833
- You can't just sit here
and cry.

06:07.835 --> 06:10.736
- Oh, I can so
just sit here and cry!

06:10.738 --> 06:12.504
- Two million hits
in the first week...

06:12.506 --> 06:14.906
And then the parodies
started.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.576
One from the philippines
got 12 million hits.

06:17.578 --> 06:23.415
- [speaking native language]

06:23.417 --> 06:26.618
- And the late night comedy guys
had a field day with it.

06:26.620 --> 06:30.021
- [fake crying]
- oh, don't.

06:30.023 --> 06:34.626
Aw, come on, baby wawa.
Don't be such a baby.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.828
Oh, no.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.732
It's gonna be all right.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.468
It's gonna be
all right.

06:43.470 --> 06:45.404
For weekend update,
I'm seth meyers.

06:45.406 --> 06:47.005
That's baby wawa.
Good night.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.473
- Bye.

06:48.475 --> 06:50.409
- After my clip blew up,
I actually got a call

06:50.411 --> 06:53.078
From the double rainbow guy
and the fat <i>star wars</i> kid.

06:53.080 --> 06:57.082
Turns out
they have a support group.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.951
Not really my scene.

06:59.953 --> 07:03.422
- Years ago, the senator
promised a left turn lane

07:03.424 --> 07:05.056
By the arby's.

07:05.058 --> 07:07.926
So I wanna know where in
the name of horsey sauce is it?

07:07.928 --> 07:09.428
Well, yeah, you--
hold on.

07:09.430 --> 07:11.196
- Hi.

07:11.198 --> 07:13.198
I keep seeing this symbol
in the accounts from last year.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.001
It's all over the place.
I don't know what it means.

07:16.003 --> 07:17.469
- That's the reason
kevin got fired.

07:17.471 --> 07:18.837
It's his magic number.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.806
He used to use it
to balance his accounts.

07:20.808 --> 07:22.207
He used to call it
a keleven.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.676
He told dwight,
"a mistake plus keleven

07:24.678 --> 07:26.211
Gets you home by seven."

07:26.213 --> 07:28.580
He was home by 4:45
that day.

07:32.151 --> 07:34.186
- Oh, I live in poland now...

07:34.188 --> 07:37.122
The scranton of the eu.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.658
Thank you for flying me
out here for the weekend.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.893
I'm looking forward
to the reunion panel tomorrow.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.929
Can't wait to see everyone.

07:43.931 --> 07:46.231
Well, almost everyone.

07:46.233 --> 07:47.766
- Hello!

07:47.768 --> 07:49.734
[laughing]
hello!

07:49.736 --> 07:51.670
- Oh.
- Hi!

07:51.672 --> 07:54.673
- No.
- Oh. [laughs nervously]

07:54.675 --> 07:56.241
- How did you know
my plane had arrived?

07:56.243 --> 07:57.742
How long have you been
stalking me?

07:57.744 --> 07:59.711
- Oh, no, no, no.
My plane just got in.

07:59.713 --> 08:01.079
From new york.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.148
Are you still with piotr?
- No.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.816
And I thought
I unfriended you.

08:04.818 --> 08:08.253
- Anyone can follow
a twitter feed.

08:08.255 --> 08:11.156
Wanna share a cab?

08:11.158 --> 08:14.125
After dwight fired me,
I moved to new york...

08:14.127 --> 08:16.795
To write
the great american novel.

08:16.797 --> 08:19.231
I have six roommates.
Heh.

08:19.233 --> 08:21.233
Which are better than friends,
you know,

08:21.235 --> 08:23.068
'cause they have to give you
one month's notice

08:23.070 --> 08:25.937
Before they leave.

08:25.939 --> 08:28.673
- Hey-oh!
- Andy?

08:28.675 --> 08:31.142
- You're back?
- Yeah.

08:31.144 --> 08:33.979
- That's baby wawa, right?
Oh, my god!

08:33.981 --> 08:35.780
- Hey, man,
good to see you.

08:35.782 --> 08:37.616
- Thank you.
Yeah.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.584
Hey! Aw!

08:39.586 --> 08:41.753
A bear hug
from my favorite mama grizzly.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.288
- Andy, I've been worried
about you.

08:43.290 --> 08:44.890
How are you?

08:44.892 --> 08:47.125
- A little warm.
- Poor, poor andy.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.227
Okay.
[struggling]

08:49.229 --> 08:51.763
Thank you, phyllis.
- Hello, hello.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.131
- Hey!
- Dar-ryl!

08:53.133 --> 08:54.766
- Darryl!
- Hey!

08:54.768 --> 08:56.268
- Hey, what's up?

08:56.270 --> 08:57.302
- Didn't I just see you
at the airport

08:57.304 --> 08:59.104
Jumping in a limo?
- What?

08:59.106 --> 09:00.839
Must've been
another devilishly handsome,

09:00.841 --> 09:02.240
Debonair individual.
- Hmm.

09:02.242 --> 09:04.242
- Hey, man,
how you doing?

09:04.244 --> 09:06.811
I, um--I didn't call 'cause I
figured you changed the number.

09:06.813 --> 09:08.813
- No, I didn't change
the number.

09:08.815 --> 09:11.216
All good, though.
Phone never rings.

09:12.318 --> 09:14.152
- What! Ohh!

09:14.154 --> 09:15.320
- Surprise!

09:15.322 --> 09:16.755
I thought you guys
couldn't come.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.023
- Yeah, but then
they moved the panel

09:18.025 --> 09:19.124
To the same weekend,

09:19.126 --> 09:20.859
And the doc crew paid
to fly us in.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.127
It was kismet.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.696
- Kismet?
Yeah, right.

09:24.698 --> 09:28.099
Pam and I came up with excuses
for every other weekend.

09:28.101 --> 09:30.101
You remember my two
lap band surgeries, right?

10:32.733 --> 10:34.733
- They wanted me
to go to the bachelorette party

10:34.735 --> 10:36.101
With the girls.
Really?

10:36.103 --> 10:38.003
Such a cliche.

10:38.005 --> 10:39.704
I'm a man.

10:39.706 --> 10:42.374
So I'm going to the bachelor
party with the boys.

10:42.376 --> 10:45.977
I just have to remember
how I acted before I came out.

10:45.979 --> 10:49.280

What are you doing?

11:47.474 --> 11:48.973
- Jim, it's fine.

11:48.975 --> 11:50.375
He'll just get you
on his cell phone,

11:50.377 --> 11:52.310
And then that'll go viral.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.879
- That happens a lot?
- Yeah, I guess.

11:54.881 --> 11:57.782
But things are going well,
actually.

11:57.784 --> 12:01.920
I spoke at cornell
during commencement week.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.888
I mean, the seniors invited me
as a joke,

12:03.890 --> 12:05.824
But it was a huge success.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.826
- Well, I bet it was a smash.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.360
That's how I got my new job
in the admissions office.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.863
- Is that
a volunteer program or...

12:11.865 --> 12:14.999
- No. It's a job.

12:15.001 --> 12:16.968
Things are going great.

12:16.970 --> 12:20.305
- Let's get a drink in you, huh?
- Yes!

12:20.307 --> 12:23.374

12:28.515 --> 12:31.049

my big sister angela.

12:31.051 --> 12:33.885

12:33.887 --> 12:35.487
We even have
our own special language.

12:35.489 --> 12:38.857
[speaking in
indistinct language]

12:38.859 --> 12:40.325
[both laughing]

12:40.327 --> 12:42.494
People love it.

12:42.496 --> 12:44.395
- They do.

12:44.397 --> 12:47.298
- [sighs] man, how long
have we been sitting here?

12:47.300 --> 12:48.833
- Hi, boys!

12:48.835 --> 12:50.935
All: Ohh...
- Here we go!

12:50.937 --> 12:53.304
- Oh, thank god.
We are famished!

12:53.306 --> 12:56.941
- Hey, did somebody order
the chef special?

12:56.943 --> 12:58.276
- Right there.
- Right here.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.844
- No, we haven't ordered
anything.

12:59.846 --> 13:01.412
No one's even taken
our drinks.

13:01.414 --> 13:02.914
Uh, what is
the chef special?

13:02.916 --> 13:04.149
[rihanna's <i>s&m</i> playing]

13:04.151 --> 13:08.052
- I bet you boys
have a big appetite.

13:08.054 --> 13:09.988
- Oh, we do.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.290
So we'll have an onion loaf
for the table, please.

13:12.292 --> 13:15.093
And tell us
about your heartiest soups.

13:15.095 --> 13:18.963
- Mm, I know what you want.
I know <i>exactly</i> what you want.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.232
- Yes, an onion loaf
for the table.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.500
But that's not all.

13:22.502 --> 13:23.968
Now the chef special
sounded good.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.805
What is it exactly?
- Ooh. Shh.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.139
- Okay, what are you doing?

13:28.141 --> 13:29.407
Are you giving me a taste
of the chef special?

13:29.409 --> 13:31.075
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm?

13:31.077 --> 13:32.844
Tastes like cigarettes.

13:32.846 --> 13:35.880
That won't work.
That's no good.

13:35.882 --> 13:37.448
- Whoo!
- What?

13:37.450 --> 13:39.417
[laughter]
[knock at door]

13:39.419 --> 13:43.121
- Okay.
- Oh, boy.

13:43.123 --> 13:45.323
- Oh!

13:45.325 --> 13:46.825
- Heard you guys needed
some pipes fixed,

13:46.827 --> 13:48.993
Or cleaned or whatever.

13:48.995 --> 13:51.029
Angela's special repair man
is here.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.397
- Wait, what is this?

13:52.399 --> 13:55.867
- Shut up.
Jakey?

13:55.869 --> 13:57.869
- Mom?
- Wait. Wait.

13:57.871 --> 13:59.938
What?
- Oh, man.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.139
- No, no, no, no.
Just do your work.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.373
Pretend mom's not here.

14:02.375 --> 14:04.309
- Uh, that seems
inappropriate.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.878
- Give 'em a good show,
my little entrepreneur.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.546
- Okay.
- Take it off.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.849
[big & rich's <i>save a horse</i>

14:10.851 --> 14:12.884
- Yeah!
Good song choice, jakey.

14:12.886 --> 14:14.853
Stripper's only as good

14:34.207 --> 14:36.007
All: Ohh!

14:36.009 --> 14:37.375
- Angela, are you all right?
- I don't know!

14:37.377 --> 14:38.877
I don't know.
- Oh, gee--

14:38.879 --> 14:40.211
- Oh, my god!

14:40.213 --> 14:42.013
- Be gentle, jakey,
gentle.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.648
Just a second.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.516
Just one second.
Look.

14:45.518 --> 14:47.986
- Okay, if anything,
this is rougher!

14:47.988 --> 14:49.621
Stop it, meredith!

14:49.623 --> 14:52.223
- Fine. My bad!
Go ahead, jakey!

14:52.225 --> 14:54.425
- Uh, no.
It's o--thank you.

14:54.427 --> 14:55.627
You know what?
You don't have to--

14:55.629 --> 14:56.661
Oh! No, no, no.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.263
No, no, no.
It's okay.

14:58.265 --> 14:59.931
- Now, for the last time,

14:59.933 --> 15:01.432
I'd like a side salad
with balsamic.

15:01.434 --> 15:04.002
- Dwight, for the last time,
she's not a waitress.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.470
- You're telling me!

15:05.472 --> 15:07.305
- If you want her to leave,
just tip her.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.374
- What for? We haven't even
gotten bread yet.

15:09.376 --> 15:12.310
Does anyone wanna split
a twice baked potato?

15:12.312 --> 15:15.947
Do you have those?
Those aren't deep fried, right?

15:15.949 --> 15:17.248
[laughter]

15:17.250 --> 15:18.650
- [sighs]
[creaking]

15:18.652 --> 15:21.286
What was that?
- It's just the wind.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.321
- Will you lock the door?
- Okay.

15:23.323 --> 15:26.424
- [sighs]

15:26.426 --> 15:28.393
- It's just the wind, see?
Nothing.

15:28.395 --> 15:29.694
- All right, you know,

15:29.696 --> 15:31.229
You don't have to leave
the door wide open.

15:31.231 --> 15:32.630
We get it.
It's the wind.

15:32.632 --> 15:33.998
Just come and shut--oh!
My god!

15:34.000 --> 15:35.967
[all screaming]

15:35.969 --> 15:38.036
- Phyllis!
- What's happening?

15:42.541 --> 15:44.142
- Obut I think I ateught
too much bone marrow.

15:44.144 --> 15:45.176
[phone ringing]
- oh, it's the girls.

15:45.178 --> 15:47.211
Hey, pam.
What?

15:47.213 --> 15:49.147
Angela's been kidnapped!

15:49.149 --> 15:51.049
Phyllis left the door open

15:51.051 --> 15:53.151
And some freak came
and grabbed her and fled.

15:53.153 --> 15:56.020
- Good old mose.
[laughing]

15:56.022 --> 15:58.156
- They think it was mose.

15:58.158 --> 16:00.224
- Oh, great, he's getting into
the spirit of the festivities.

16:00.226 --> 16:01.726
Fantastic.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.161
He just pulled off
a <i>braut entfuhrung.</i>

16:03.163 --> 16:04.529
- What is that?

16:04.531 --> 16:06.164
- A ceremonial bridal
kidnapping.

16:06.166 --> 16:09.300
He will take the bride
and hide her at a local pub.

16:09.302 --> 16:12.203
And when I find the place,
I have to buy everyone drinks.

16:12.205 --> 16:15.139
Ah. All right!
Oh, mose!

16:15.141 --> 16:16.641
- Wait a minute.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.142
You said the tradition is
for the groom to search for her,

16:18.144 --> 16:20.211
And it ends at a pub.

16:20.213 --> 16:23.548
So how about the last pub you'd
ever set foot in in this town?

16:23.550 --> 16:25.149
- Right.
Which one is that?

16:25.151 --> 16:27.452
- Mm, hey, driver,
why don't you take us

16:27.454 --> 16:30.355
To 3030 adams?

16:34.660 --> 16:39.263
Is that mose?
- Yes, it is!

16:39.265 --> 16:42.066
I am here for my bride!
- [giggles]

16:42.068 --> 16:44.102
Well, first, buy us a drink.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.537
All: â™ª if you want your bride,

16:54.781 --> 16:59.050
- Well, well, well,

16:59.052 --> 17:01.786
That's six "wells."

17:01.788 --> 17:05.390
Did I get <i>that</i> number right,
dwight?

17:05.392 --> 17:07.692
- I heard
you bought a bar, kevin.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.094
- Yes. I did.

17:10.096 --> 17:12.130
This one.

17:12.132 --> 17:15.299
Now get out!

17:15.301 --> 17:18.736
- Why did you pick this place?
- Ohh.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.405
- You?

17:20.407 --> 17:23.074
You did this as a prank.
My own bestisch mensch.

17:23.076 --> 17:24.575
- Nope, not a prank.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.210
I think it's time
for you to bury the hatchet.

17:26.212 --> 17:27.745
- [scoffs]
waste of a good hatchet.

17:27.747 --> 17:30.348
- Okay, just talk.

17:32.151 --> 17:34.252
- Well, w--

17:34.254 --> 17:35.720

the first time,

17:35.722 --> 17:38.122
- I know dwight misses kevin.

17:38.124 --> 17:41.626
I saw him making his portrait
out of a wooly willy.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.294
Tomorrow's his wedding day.

17:43.296 --> 17:45.663
You can't be anything but happy
on your wedding day.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.799
- It was nothing personal.

17:47.801 --> 17:49.834
It's just that you were terrible
at your job.

17:49.836 --> 17:52.070
- You're just saying
that to make me feel better.

17:52.072 --> 17:54.372
- No, really.
You were terrible at math...

17:54.374 --> 17:57.141
And organization,
time management,

17:57.143 --> 17:58.776
Personal hygiene.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.311
Your internet searches
were so filthy

18:00.313 --> 18:02.146
We had to throw out
your computer.

18:02.148 --> 18:04.215
- Is that all it was?

18:04.217 --> 18:07.151
- That's it.

18:07.153 --> 18:09.353
- Come here.

18:09.355 --> 18:10.621
- I missed you, kevin.

18:10.623 --> 18:13.357
- I missed you!
- Ohh.

18:13.359 --> 18:15.560

18:15.562 --> 18:21.466
Guten prank number three.

18:21.468 --> 18:23.668
- You've had your drink.
Now where is my bride?

18:23.670 --> 18:25.470
[all cheering]

18:25.472 --> 18:28.473
Mose! What...

18:28.475 --> 18:30.842
Ohh, mose.

18:30.844 --> 18:32.543
- What the [bleep]
is your problem,

18:32.545 --> 18:35.379
You [bleep]
[bleep] [bleep]?

18:38.550 --> 18:41.519
- Hey.
Hey, is angela coming, or--

18:41.521 --> 18:43.454
- No. We can't see each other
on our wedding day.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.690
And her legs are still numb
from being in the trunk.

18:45.692 --> 18:47.391
- Right.
- Hey, guys.

18:47.393 --> 18:49.127
All: Stanley!

18:49.129 --> 18:51.896
- How's florida?
- Oh, great.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.631
Yes, I'm living
in florida now.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.466
Little town
called florida city,

18:55.468 --> 18:57.835
Just on the edge
of the everglades.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.570
The man who delivered
my divorce papers

18:59.572 --> 19:02.874
Came by fan boat,
which was kinda fun.

19:02.876 --> 19:06.911
I sit on my porch all day,
carving birds.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.679
- Am I the only one
that's nervous? Heh heh.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.781
How are you doing with this?
Should we have bailed?

19:10.783 --> 19:12.850
- No, no, I'm fine.

19:12.852 --> 19:16.787
- Doesn't seem like
anyone cares about us anyway.

19:16.789 --> 19:21.259
- I guess this was worth being
filmed nonstop for nine years.

19:21.261 --> 19:24.262
- I'm sorry, guys.
This is probably on me.

19:24.264 --> 19:27.265
I got hated on pretty hard
when that auto-tune went viral.

19:27.267 --> 19:29.934
â™ª just sit here and cry,
just sit here and cry â™ª

19:29.936 --> 19:33.371
â™ª oh, I can so
just sit here and cry â™ª

19:33.373 --> 19:35.373
â™ª you guys are really mean

19:35.375 --> 19:36.941
â™ª it can't end like this,
you know â™ª

19:36.943 --> 19:38.709
â™ª slept in my car last night,
quit my job â™ª

19:38.711 --> 19:39.777
â™ª burned all my bridges

19:39.779 --> 19:41.879
â™ª and I did unspeakable things

19:41.881 --> 19:43.581
- â™ª you're just not good

19:43.583 --> 19:44.849
â™ª you're just not good

19:44.851 --> 19:46.184
- â™ª are you insane?

19:46.186 --> 19:47.852
- â™ª you're just not good

19:47.854 --> 19:49.253
â™ª you're just not good

19:49.255 --> 19:50.888
- â™ª chill out
[crying]

19:50.890 --> 19:52.957
- [giggling]
- â™ª just sit here and cry

19:52.959 --> 19:55.593
- People actually
dance to this.

19:55.595 --> 19:57.628
It's in my juke box.

19:57.630 --> 20:00.431
None of the money
goes to andy, though.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.900
- â™ª cry, cry, cry

20:02.902 --> 20:06.871
- [laughing]
yeah, people hate you.

20:06.873 --> 20:10.374
- I'll go talk to the manager.
Maybe we should just go home.

20:15.914 --> 20:18.282
- Hey, it's andy bernard.

20:18.284 --> 20:19.617
All: Nard dog!

20:19.619 --> 20:22.420
[cheers and applause]

20:22.422 --> 20:23.888
- Roo-doo-doo-doo!

20:23.890 --> 20:26.257
All: Roo-doo-doo-doo-doo!

20:26.259 --> 20:27.925
Roo-doo-doo-doo-doo!

20:27.927 --> 20:29.894
Roo-doo-doo-doo-doo!

20:29.896 --> 20:31.929
Roo-doo-doo-doo-doo!

20:31.931 --> 20:34.232
- Roo-doo-doo-doo-doo!

20:34.234 --> 20:37.668
[cheers and applause]

20:42.374 --> 20:44.242
- How did it feel
played out on tv?

20:44.244 --> 20:46.510
- It's like seeing a documentary
about how your food is made.

20:46.512 --> 20:48.246
It's kinda disgusting.

20:48.248 --> 20:50.815
You learn a lot, but I didn't
wanna know any of it.

20:50.817 --> 20:53.618
- With today's modern
surveillance technology,

20:53.620 --> 20:57.588
We are in a constant state
of being watched,

20:57.590 --> 20:58.823
Whether
it's our government

20:58.825 --> 21:00.358
Or the government
of other countries,

21:00.360 --> 21:01.859
A.K.A. Google.

21:01.861 --> 21:04.795
You guys are being filmed
way more than we ever were.

21:04.797 --> 21:06.897
- Uh, no one recognizes me.

21:06.899 --> 21:08.899
But now all my friends
call me plop.

21:08.901 --> 21:11.902
So...Thanks, pbs.
[laughter]

21:11.904 --> 21:15.439
- Uh, jim, that dvd
in the last episode

21:15.441 --> 21:17.341
Was so romantic.

21:17.343 --> 21:19.577
And, um, I think
we'd all love to know,

21:19.579 --> 21:23.381
Pam, what romantic thing
did you do to pay jim back

21:23.383 --> 21:24.815
For leaving athlead?

21:24.817 --> 21:27.918
- Well, I mean, how do you
pay back someone

21:27.920 --> 21:30.321
For something like that?

21:30.323 --> 21:34.292
But, uh, I don't know.
I'm working on something.

21:34.294 --> 21:37.428
- She pays me back every day,
just by being my wife.

21:37.430 --> 21:38.596
So that's fine.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.665
All: Aww.

21:40.667 --> 21:42.600
- O-kay.

21:42.602 --> 21:45.770
- All I can say is,
if I had jim,

21:45.772 --> 21:48.472
He would have a free pass
to do anything.

21:48.474 --> 21:51.642
I mean,
if I lucked into that,

21:51.644 --> 21:53.611
He could do anything--

21:53.613 --> 21:55.413
<i>Anything.</i>

21:55.415 --> 21:58.749
- I'm sorry,
is there a question?

21:58.751 --> 22:02.653
- Uh, no.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.555
- Pam, what was in
that teapot letter?

22:04.557 --> 22:07.591
- Oh, um,
well, you know, I--

22:07.593 --> 22:10.728
I just--I think I would rather
keep that private.

22:10.730 --> 22:13.431
You know, if you'd been filmed
for nine years of your life,

22:13.433 --> 22:16.000
There'd be some things that you
just wanna keep to yourself.

22:16.002 --> 22:19.837
- I hear ya.
What did it say?

22:19.839 --> 22:21.339
- We're gonna move on.

22:21.341 --> 22:22.606
Next question, please.

22:22.608 --> 22:24.975
- Do you find that your life
feels pointless

22:24.977 --> 22:27.645
Now that nobody's actually
filming you anymore?

22:27.647 --> 22:29.580
- Yes.

22:32.050 --> 22:34.819
- I wanna know how everyone
felt they were portrayed.

22:34.821 --> 22:37.388
Was it accurate?
- I got a beef with that.

22:37.390 --> 22:39.590
Um, for the first
seven years,

22:39.592 --> 22:41.592
I was getting my phd
in school psychology,

22:41.594 --> 22:42.960
And they didn't show it.

22:42.962 --> 22:44.695
Yes, I was getting hammered.

22:44.697 --> 22:49.967
But, hey, it was college.

22:49.969 --> 22:51.869
- I have a question
for jim and pam.

22:51.871 --> 22:55.373
Everyone watching sees
how much you love each other

22:55.375 --> 22:57.441
And how you're soul mates.

22:57.443 --> 22:59.877
So, pam,
how could you doubt that

22:59.879 --> 23:02.046
When jim moved
to philadelphia?

23:02.048 --> 23:05.583
- Um, you know what, I actually
didn't handle that move, uh,

23:05.585 --> 23:06.984
Very gracefully,

23:06.986 --> 23:10.621
From not communicating
to being a little selfish.

23:10.623 --> 23:12.556
- Listen, um...

23:12.558 --> 23:15.693
I was scared, you know?

23:15.695 --> 23:18.129
I loved what I had,
and I didn't wanna risk it.

23:18.131 --> 23:22.800
And I think that maybe
I did doubt him a little too.

23:22.802 --> 23:24.668
Which was wrong,

23:24.670 --> 23:27.538
Because he's shown me
time and again.

23:27.540 --> 23:29.440
But when the documentary
started airing,

23:29.442 --> 23:30.641
People on the street told me

23:30.643 --> 23:33.511
That I had
this fairy-tale romance.

23:33.513 --> 23:35.413
But there were
a lot of times last year

23:35.415 --> 23:37.615
When it did not feel
like a fairy tale.

23:37.617 --> 23:42.119
But then it got deeper,
and it got stronger,

23:42.121 --> 23:44.922
And now it's better
than a fairy tale.

23:44.924 --> 23:49.593
It's like a long book
that you never want to end.

23:49.595 --> 23:50.895
And you're fine with that,

23:50.897 --> 23:53.964
Because you just never, ever
wanna leave it.

23:53.966 --> 23:55.599
All: Aww.

23:55.601 --> 23:57.201
- Like <i>harry potter.</i>

23:57.203 --> 24:00.638
- Yeah, like <i>harry potter.</i>

24:00.640 --> 24:03.641
- I have a question
for erin.

24:03.643 --> 24:05.576
- Really?
- Yes.

24:05.578 --> 24:08.646
Um, the thing I found
most compelling

24:08.648 --> 24:13.584
About the documentary was your
search for your birth mother.

24:13.586 --> 24:15.719
- Thank you.

24:15.721 --> 24:20.658
- So my question is,
um, do--don't you hate her?

24:20.660 --> 24:24.462
I mean, I would just imagine
that you were so angry at her

24:24.464 --> 24:27.932
That you would hate her.

24:27.934 --> 24:29.600
- Maybe sometimes.

24:29.602 --> 24:32.570
But not like <i>hate</i> hate.

24:32.572 --> 24:36.207
More just like,
"mom, I hate you!"

24:36.209 --> 24:40.144
And then she would say,
"go to your room, young lady."

24:40.146 --> 24:42.646
And I'd stamp my foot
and run upstairs.

24:42.648 --> 24:45.649
And I have a room,
which is really cool.

24:45.651 --> 24:48.519
And then we'd just
have dinner together.

24:48.521 --> 24:49.820
But I don't know.
I'd have to meet her.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.555
[laughs]
thanks.

24:54.693 --> 24:56.861
- Erin...

24:56.863 --> 24:59.864
- Yes?

24:59.866 --> 25:01.665
- Um...

25:01.667 --> 25:06.637
Oh, erin...

25:06.639 --> 25:12.076
- Yes?
Is there a follow-up question?

25:16.548 --> 25:20.684
Mom?

25:20.686 --> 25:22.520
All: Aww.

25:22.522 --> 25:25.589
[applause]

25:30.962 --> 25:33.564
- Erin...

25:33.566 --> 25:36.634
Same question,
but about your dad?

25:42.574 --> 25:45.242
- Well, this feels like
a good place to stop.

25:45.244 --> 25:47.211
Let's thank all
of our wonderful panelists

25:47.213 --> 25:50.714
For being here
on this wonderful panel today.

25:56.588 --> 25:58.756
Next week at
the scranton cultural center,

25:58.758 --> 26:01.792
Don't forget,
irish step dancing semifinals.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.694
Winning team
to mid-atlantic.

26:03.696 --> 26:07.197
[applause]

26:12.037 --> 26:14.204
[scattered cheers]

27:34.708 --> 27:38.043
- Right there, sir.
Baske- okay.Ifts?

27:38.045 --> 27:40.212
- Hi. I'm dakota.

27:40.214 --> 27:41.347
- Jeff bomondo.

27:41.349 --> 27:43.082
I sell ceramic tile
out of newark.

27:43.084 --> 27:44.717
- Nice.
- My wife's name is kathryn.

27:44.719 --> 27:46.552
I can show you
my social security card,

27:46.554 --> 27:49.355
If it helps.

27:52.292 --> 27:53.292
- Uck.

27:53.294 --> 27:54.760
Look at this mud.

27:54.762 --> 27:56.462
Can you imagine
if I had worn my jimmy choos?

27:56.464 --> 27:59.031
I just saved you
600 bucks, mister.

27:59.033 --> 28:00.032
- Thanks for helping out,
sweetie.

28:00.034 --> 28:01.033
- Mm.

28:01.035 --> 28:03.202
- Kelly.
You're here.

28:03.204 --> 28:06.505
- Hey, ryan!
- Hey.

28:06.507 --> 28:08.674
- Whose baby is this?
Oh, are you, like, a manny now?

28:08.676 --> 28:12.578
- No, this little guy
is mine.

28:12.580 --> 28:14.246
So I was dating this girl,
and one day,

28:14.248 --> 28:16.148
She went out
to get a new charger

28:16.150 --> 28:17.449
For her e-cigarette.

28:17.451 --> 28:20.085
Never came back.

28:20.087 --> 28:21.420
Oldest story in the book.

28:21.422 --> 28:22.688
[baby squeals]

28:22.690 --> 28:24.256
Say "hi," drake.

28:24.258 --> 28:26.058
- Drake is your baby's name?
- Yeah.

28:26.060 --> 28:27.726
- That is an amazing name.
I'm obsessed with drake.

28:27.728 --> 28:29.261
[drake babbles]
his last album,

28:29.263 --> 28:31.296
It just touched me
to pieces.

28:31.298 --> 28:32.331
- No, kelly,
he's not named

28:32.333 --> 28:34.066
After a hip-hop artist
from 2011.

28:34.068 --> 28:35.768
It's drake,
like a mix of drew and blake.

28:35.770 --> 28:37.669
- Cool.

28:37.671 --> 28:41.106
- Well, he is so cute.
Ravi, check out this cute baby.

28:41.108 --> 28:42.341
I'm obsessed with him.
- Oh?

28:42.343 --> 28:43.609
- Ravi is a pediatrician.

28:43.611 --> 28:46.111
And some of his patients
are total uggos.

28:46.113 --> 28:47.746
- They're called premature,
sweetie.

28:47.748 --> 28:49.281
- Yeah.

28:49.283 --> 28:51.583
- It's good
to see you again, ryan.

28:51.585 --> 28:53.619
- Let me help you up.
- Thanks.

28:53.621 --> 28:55.621
- Ooh! Oh!
- Ow!

28:55.623 --> 28:57.256
- Oh, boy,
maybe your heels are too high.

28:57.258 --> 28:59.324
- No, my heels
aren't too high.

28:59.326 --> 29:01.827
It's because I spent
three hours in a car trunk.

29:01.829 --> 29:03.162
Thanks for not locking
the door

29:03.164 --> 29:04.763
When I asked you to,
phyllis.

29:04.765 --> 29:07.466
- Ohh.
- [sighs]

29:07.468 --> 29:10.636
Sorry, phyllis.
You didn't know.

29:10.638 --> 29:12.638
As long as I can get
to the altar.

29:12.640 --> 29:15.140
- Oh, I'm gonna get you
to that altar.

29:15.142 --> 29:18.777
You can take that
to the bank.

29:18.779 --> 29:22.147
- You ready?
- [chuckles] you kidding?

29:22.149 --> 29:23.348
I was born ready.

29:23.350 --> 29:24.850
[mimicking
heavy metal guitars]

29:24.852 --> 29:26.218
- Dwight, dwight, dwight.

29:26.220 --> 29:28.487
Um...

29:28.489 --> 29:30.689
I don't know
how to tell you this, but...

29:30.691 --> 29:32.324
We have a little bit
of a problem.

29:32.326 --> 29:34.693
- Oh, no.
What?

29:34.695 --> 29:37.196
- The minister just told me
that it's tradition

29:37.198 --> 29:40.666
For the bestisch mensch
to be older than the groom.

29:40.668 --> 29:42.234
- Oh, come on.

29:42.236 --> 29:43.502
I've never heard
of such a thing.

29:43.504 --> 29:45.204
- I haven't heard of it,
obviously.

29:45.206 --> 29:46.572
But I'm out,

29:46.574 --> 29:48.307
Because I'm significantly
younger than you.

29:48.309 --> 29:50.242
- Not--significant
is a big word.

29:50.244 --> 29:51.743
- I think it's definitely--
well, okay.

29:51.745 --> 29:53.245
Either way--
- I think you're only a teeny--

29:53.247 --> 29:56.148
- Either way, dwight...

29:56.150 --> 29:58.450
I can't be there for you.

29:58.452 --> 30:00.285
I'm sorry.

30:00.287 --> 30:02.387
- Jim.

30:02.389 --> 30:08.193
- I just...Really wish
there was something I could do.

30:14.868 --> 30:17.836
- [whispering]
michael.

30:17.838 --> 30:20.272
I can't believe you came.

30:20.274 --> 30:23.175
- That's what she said.

30:24.844 --> 30:27.846
- [laughing]

30:27.848 --> 30:29.915
- Best prank ever.

30:29.917 --> 30:31.517
- Yeah!

30:34.522 --> 30:42.594
â™ª

30:57.744 --> 30:59.945
- As is traditional
to the schrutes,

30:59.947 --> 31:03.215
The lovers are standing
in their own graves

31:03.217 --> 31:07.419
As a reminder
that this is the only escape

31:07.421 --> 31:10.255
From what
they are about to do.

31:10.257 --> 31:11.857
- See, I get what they're
trying to do,

31:11.859 --> 31:13.759
But why are the graves
so shallow?

31:13.761 --> 31:16.395
Ugh.

31:21.868 --> 31:27.272
- "arise, my love, my fair one,
and come away.

"for lo,
the winter is passed.

They'll be used for seating.

Drake has a bit of a rash.

33:33.500 --> 33:35.033
And he's hot.
- Oh, no.

33:35.035 --> 33:36.501
- I was wondering,

33:36.503 --> 33:38.370
Could you maybe examine him
for a second?

33:38.372 --> 33:40.505
- Oh, yeah, you're not
feeling well, little guy?

33:40.507 --> 33:41.740
Okay, sure.
Should we go inside?

33:41.742 --> 33:43.475
- Actually,
could you go inside?

33:43.477 --> 33:45.377
I'm feeling
a little dehydrated.

33:45.379 --> 33:47.479
I could really use
a little break, have some water.

33:47.481 --> 33:48.880
- Are you sure
you don't wanna go in?

33:48.882 --> 33:51.350
- Ravi, just do it.
That baby is burning up.

- I don't know, ryan.
Baby drake didn't look so good.

34:05.099 --> 34:06.932
- He'll be fine.
I let him suck on a strawberry.

34:06.934 --> 34:08.600
He's allergic,
but he'll get over it fast.

34:08.602 --> 34:09.868
I had to talk to you.

34:09.870 --> 34:12.137
- You gave your baby
an allergic reaction

Just to talk to me?

He had to get two phones
with two numbers,

34:27.588 --> 34:28.754
And he pays two bills.

34:28.756 --> 34:30.489
Oh, my gosh,
it's choreographed!

Uh, they left together

Kelly was hoping
that you would keep the baby,

So they can start
a new life together.

- Oh, that's it.
Here.

And then they married
each other.

- Good night.

- Good luck.
- Great. It was really fun.

37:13.620 --> 37:14.986
- Good evening.

37:14.988 --> 37:16.288

a big after party

37:16.290 --> 37:17.789
In the warehouse tonight.

37:17.791 --> 37:19.658
- Yeah, I heard.
It sounds kinda lame.

37:19.660 --> 37:22.160
No offense.
You going, toby?

37:22.162 --> 37:24.696
- Oh, I don't know.
I might turn in early.

37:24.698 --> 37:26.565
- It's only 6:00.

37:26.567 --> 37:28.266
Come on, everybody's going.
- You have to go, toby.

37:28.268 --> 37:30.035
- Yeah, come on, tobes.
- Come on, toby.

37:30.037 --> 37:31.836
- Come on!
- Yeah, I'll stop by.

[all cheering]
- there he is.

37:42.915 --> 37:45.016
- [sighs]

37:45.018 --> 37:48.186
I need to get out of this dress.
- I gotta get out of this dress.

37:49.989 --> 37:51.957
- Oh, I'm sorry, pam.

37:51.959 --> 37:53.625
- What's going on?

37:53.627 --> 37:55.026
- [sighs]

37:55.028 --> 37:56.828
[whispering]
why are you still here?

37:56.830 --> 37:58.997
- I'm so sorry.
They were an hour late.

37:58.999 --> 38:00.665
- No, really,
what's going on?

38:00.667 --> 38:02.701
- Okay, okay.
Um...

38:02.703 --> 38:07.672
So...This past year
has been really great,

38:07.674 --> 38:11.009
And you've been great,
and...

38:11.011 --> 38:13.612
I just--I know that you had
to make this choice,

38:13.614 --> 38:15.947
And you had to give
something up for me.

38:15.949 --> 38:18.016
But I never want you
to have to give up anything.

38:18.018 --> 38:20.752
I just thought if I could
get us an offer,

38:20.754 --> 38:22.887
Then there wouldn't be
anything standing in our way,

38:22.889 --> 38:27.092
And I could come to you
with this big jim gesture...

38:27.094 --> 38:30.729
And show you all at once
just how much I love you,

38:30.731 --> 38:34.099
And how much I really do
believe in your future.

38:34.101 --> 38:36.067
- Sorry, how long have you been
showing the house?

38:36.069 --> 38:38.970
- About two months.
- That's why it's so clean.

38:38.972 --> 38:40.271
- Yeah.

38:40.273 --> 38:42.707
- I mean, you were gonna do this
without me?

38:42.709 --> 38:46.077
- Well, you--you bought
the house without telling me,

38:46.079 --> 38:49.347
So I thought I could sell it
without telling you.

38:49.349 --> 38:52.283
- Oh...Okay.
- [laughs]

38:52.285 --> 38:54.119
- Where would we go?

38:54.121 --> 38:57.956
- Austin? Maybe.

38:57.958 --> 38:59.858
- I promise you...

38:59.860 --> 39:01.326
You don't have to do this
for me.

39:01.328 --> 39:03.361
- I'm doing it for us.

39:03.363 --> 39:05.330
- Okay.
- The last--

39:05.332 --> 39:07.165
- We'll take it.
- Hold on one second.

39:07.167 --> 39:09.868
The last few months
have meant the world to me.

39:09.870 --> 39:11.169
And all I care about--
- hold on a second.

39:11.171 --> 39:12.771
Wait, what did you just say?

39:12.773 --> 39:15.340
- We wanna buy your house.

39:15.342 --> 39:19.177
- [laughing]

39:19.179 --> 39:21.946
- You wanna do this?
- I wanna do this.

39:21.948 --> 39:24.716
- You really wanna do this?
- I really wanna do this!

39:24.718 --> 39:28.053
[both laughing]

39:28.055 --> 39:29.854
- Oh, my god.

39:29.856 --> 39:32.023
[rap music playing]

39:32.025 --> 39:34.125
- Hey, darryl.

39:34.127 --> 39:36.294
[whispers indistinctly]

39:36.296 --> 39:38.697
- What?

39:39.799 --> 39:41.032
- Yeah.

39:41.034 --> 39:42.067
- All right!

39:42.069 --> 39:45.003
- We're so excited.

39:45.005 --> 39:46.404
- Cool.

39:46.406 --> 39:48.106
- Oh, that's
for pbs executives only.

39:48.108 --> 39:51.076
- I had to pledge $50
to my local pbs station

39:51.078 --> 39:54.412
Just to get this.

39:54.414 --> 39:56.014
- I think your ideas
are fantastic, oscar.

39:56.016 --> 39:58.116
I'd love to contribute
to your campaign.

39:58.118 --> 40:00.819
- Thank you, david.

40:00.821 --> 40:04.823
- Uh, could I please
have your attention?

40:04.825 --> 40:08.126
So a year ago,
I got my first art commission

40:08.128 --> 40:10.962
To paint a mural
for dunder mifflin.

40:10.964 --> 40:14.833
And I decided to paint
the history of paper,

40:14.835 --> 40:16.901
Which was just some trees
and stuff.

40:16.903 --> 40:19.003
And then someone spray painted
a bunch of butts on it,

40:19.005 --> 40:20.972
And I had to start
from the beginning.

40:20.974 --> 40:24.042
But it all worked out
for the best,

40:24.044 --> 40:27.245
Because I think that
I've painted the perfect thing,

40:27.247 --> 40:29.781
Which is the history of us.

40:29.783 --> 40:31.983
All of us.

40:31.985 --> 40:33.952
And this is for you, jim.

40:33.954 --> 40:36.788
[applause]
and go ahead!

40:38.057 --> 40:40.425
[all cheering]

40:44.797 --> 40:48.233
Everyone, let's take our picture
in front of the mural.

40:57.042 --> 40:58.343
Oh, um, I just--

40:58.345 --> 41:00.078
I kind of meant
just everybody from the office.

41:00.080 --> 41:02.981
[laughter]

41:02.983 --> 41:07.051
[shutter clicking]

41:07.053 --> 41:07.952
- Very nice.

41:07.954 --> 41:11.022
Just a couple dozen more.

41:11.024 --> 41:13.925
Smiles, everybody,
smiles.

41:15.895 --> 41:17.362
All right, that's great.
I got enough.

41:17.364 --> 41:19.964
Thank you, everybody.

41:23.502 --> 41:25.403
- Let's go outside.
- Okay.

41:25.405 --> 41:27.839
[indistinct chatter]

41:33.345 --> 41:35.446
- Yeah, we all need a drink.

41:35.448 --> 41:37.448
What the--

41:37.450 --> 41:40.885
There's only dandelion tea
and raisins in here.

41:40.887 --> 41:43.021
- Hey...
Bottom drawer.

41:44.390 --> 41:46.891
- Yes!

41:46.893 --> 41:49.594
[phone ringing]

41:49.596 --> 41:50.829
- Oh, so...
- Mm-hmm.

41:50.831 --> 41:53.298
- Right.

41:58.137 --> 42:00.605
- Dunder mifflin,
this is pam.

42:00.607 --> 42:02.340
Oh, I'm sorry.

42:02.342 --> 42:07.011
Jim halpert
doesn't work here anymore.

42:09.281 --> 42:12.150
I didn't watch
the whole documentary.

42:12.152 --> 42:14.085
After a few episodes,
it was too painful.

42:14.087 --> 42:16.621
I kept wanting to scream
at pam.

42:16.623 --> 42:20.258
It took me so long
to do so many important things.

42:20.260 --> 42:23.027
It's just hard to accept
that I spent so many years

42:23.029 --> 42:25.029
Being less happy
than I could've been.

42:25.031 --> 42:28.900
Jim was 5 feet
from my desk,

42:28.902 --> 42:31.135
And it took me four years
to get to him.

42:31.137 --> 42:33.571
It'd be great
if people saw this documentary

42:33.573 --> 42:35.573
And learned from my mistakes.

42:35.575 --> 42:38.910
Not that I'm a tragic person.
I'm really happy now.

42:38.912 --> 42:41.346
But...

42:41.348 --> 42:44.182
It would just--
just make my heart soar

42:44.184 --> 42:46.584
If someone out there
saw this

42:46.586 --> 42:48.653
And she said to herself,

42:48.655 --> 42:50.421
"be strong.

42:50.423 --> 42:52.590
"trust yourself,
love yourself.

42:52.592 --> 42:54.459
"conquer your fears.

42:54.461 --> 42:56.628
"just go
after what you want.

42:56.630 --> 43:01.399
And act fast, because life
just isn't that long."

43:01.401 --> 43:04.035
- If there is one thing
that I have learned

43:04.037 --> 43:06.571
Through
this whole experience...

43:06.573 --> 43:08.172
[cheering]
it's that...

43:08.174 --> 43:12.343
If you film anybody
long enough,

43:12.345 --> 43:16.014
They're going to do
something stupid.

43:16.016 --> 43:20.518
[all whooping]
it's only human natural.

43:20.520 --> 43:21.686
- Hey, guys.

43:21.688 --> 43:24.689
- Hi.
All: Hey!

43:24.691 --> 43:26.591
- What about the honeymoon?

43:26.593 --> 43:28.493
- Oh, the honeymoon
can wait till tomorrow.

43:28.495 --> 43:30.094
We wanted to hang out
with you guys.

43:30.096 --> 43:33.164
I mean, when are we all
going to be here together again?

43:33.166 --> 43:34.699
- Aw.

43:34.701 --> 43:36.567
J, p, and d.
The three amigos.

43:36.569 --> 43:37.669
Ah, it warms my heart.

43:37.671 --> 43:39.237
Hey, what do you say,

43:39.239 --> 43:40.705
When I get back
from our honeymoon,

43:40.707 --> 43:42.240
The three of us
have a conference room meeting

43:42.242 --> 43:44.709
Just for fun?

43:44.711 --> 43:47.378
What is that meaningful look?

43:47.380 --> 43:50.315
- You know what?
Maybe we should talk.

43:50.317 --> 43:53.418
- Hey, come here.
You guys need to see this.

43:53.420 --> 43:54.686
- What is it?

43:54.688 --> 43:56.487
- You're probably
sitting there wondering

43:56.489 --> 44:00.224
What will be your mark,
what will you be known for?

44:00.226 --> 44:02.126
It might surprise you
to learn--

44:02.128 --> 44:04.996
- I finally feel ready.
Athlead is growing.

44:04.998 --> 44:06.331
- Athleap.

44:06.333 --> 44:08.433
- And jim can jump back in
without skipping a beat.

44:08.435 --> 44:10.268
We'll come back to visit.

44:10.270 --> 44:12.470
But I think it's time
for us to officially--

44:12.472 --> 44:14.105
- No, don't say it.
You're fired!

44:14.107 --> 44:15.473
You're both fired!
- Dwight, come on.

44:15.475 --> 44:17.108
Don't end on a bad note.

44:17.110 --> 44:19.010
- Don't be an idiot.
It's for the severance.

44:19.012 --> 44:20.445
The best that I can do

44:20.447 --> 44:21.646
Is one month for every year
you've been here.

44:21.648 --> 44:24.282
That's the max.

44:24.284 --> 44:26.451
- Thanks, dwight.

44:26.453 --> 44:29.287
- Hey, and if you're ever
in austin--

44:29.289 --> 44:31.122
- Whoa. Right.
For what, the art?

44:31.124 --> 44:33.491
The music?
The incredible nightlife?

44:33.493 --> 44:34.726
No, thank you.

44:34.728 --> 44:36.427
But if you're ever
in the area,

44:36.429 --> 44:38.296
You'll always have
a place to stay.

44:38.298 --> 44:39.764
In my barn.

44:39.766 --> 44:41.733
- There it is.

44:41.735 --> 44:44.002
- Do I get along
with my co-workers?

44:44.004 --> 44:46.637
Well, first of all,
I don't have co-workers anymore.

44:46.639 --> 44:48.406
I have subordinates.

44:48.408 --> 44:49.707
So...

44:49.709 --> 44:51.743
Have I gotten along
with my subordinates?

44:51.745 --> 44:53.678
Let's see.

44:53.680 --> 44:56.280
My supplier relations rep,
meredith palmer,

44:56.282 --> 44:58.583
Is the only person I know who
knows how to properly head bang

44:58.585 --> 45:01.519
To motorhead.

45:01.521 --> 45:05.490
Oscar martinez, my accountant,
is now godfather to my son.

45:05.492 --> 45:07.425
Angela schrute,
my former accountant,

45:07.427 --> 45:09.727
Is now my wife.

45:09.729 --> 45:12.030
My top salesman jim halpert
was best man at my wedding.

45:12.032 --> 45:15.033
And office administrator
pamela beesly halpert

45:15.035 --> 45:16.634
Is my best friend.

45:16.636 --> 45:17.769
So...

45:17.771 --> 45:19.704
Yes.

45:19.706 --> 45:23.174
I'd say I have gotten along
with my subordinates.

45:23.176 --> 45:25.576
- You might
feel sorry for me.

45:25.578 --> 45:27.812
But I actually
feel sorry for you.

45:27.814 --> 45:30.515
Because you're about
to leave cornell.

45:30.517 --> 45:31.783
So say it with me.

45:31.785 --> 45:35.820
All: Oh, I can so
just sit here and cry.

45:35.822 --> 45:36.821
[cheers and applause]

45:36.823 --> 45:39.657
- Oh, yes!

45:39.659 --> 45:41.826
- You did good.
Real good.

45:41.828 --> 45:44.228
- Thanks, dad--
darryl.

45:44.230 --> 45:47.832
I spent so much of my time
here at dunder mifflin

45:47.834 --> 45:49.600
Thinking about my old pals,

45:49.602 --> 45:51.536
My college a cappella group.

45:51.538 --> 45:54.138
The weird thing is...

45:54.140 --> 45:56.140
Now, I'm exactly
where I wanna be.

45:56.142 --> 45:59.644
I got my dream job
at cornell,

45:59.646 --> 46:02.747
And I'm still just thinking
about my old pals.

46:02.749 --> 46:06.250
Only now they're the ones
I made here.

46:06.252 --> 46:10.721
I wish there was a way to know
you're in the good old days

46:10.723 --> 46:13.791
Before you've actually
left them.

46:16.829 --> 46:20.131
Someone should write a song
about that.

46:20.133 --> 46:24.836
- You take something ordinary,
like a piece of paper.

46:24.838 --> 46:26.804
It's not much.

46:26.806 --> 46:29.874
But if you see it

46:29.876 --> 46:33.277
In the right way--

46:33.279 --> 46:37.582
And that's what you did
with this documentary.

46:37.584 --> 46:39.550
But seriously, you made
a nine-year documentary,

46:39.552 --> 46:42.553
And you couldn't once
show me doing my origami.

46:42.555 --> 46:46.190
[laughter]

46:48.260 --> 46:51.796
Uh--
ohh!

46:54.266 --> 46:57.268
[soft ballad]

46:57.270 --> 47:03.641
â™ª

47:03.643 --> 47:08.880
â™ª I saw a friend today,
it had been a while â™ª

47:08.882 --> 47:12.850
â™ª and we forgot
each other's names â™ª

47:12.852 --> 47:18.289
â™ª but it didn't matter
'cause deep inside â™ª

47:18.291 --> 47:22.760
â™ª the feeling
still remained the same â™ª

47:22.762 --> 47:24.829
- Imagine going back
and watching a tape

47:24.831 --> 47:26.764
Of your life.

47:26.766 --> 47:29.333
You could see yourself...

47:29.335 --> 47:33.671
Change and make mistakes...

47:33.673 --> 47:35.806
And grow up.

47:35.808 --> 47:39.777
You could watch yourself
fall in love,

47:39.779 --> 47:42.413
Watch yourself
become a husband...

47:42.415 --> 47:45.883
Become a father.

47:45.885 --> 47:49.387
You guys gave that to me.

47:49.389 --> 47:54.358
And that's
an amazing gift.

47:54.360 --> 47:58.896
- Hey, jim, remember flonkerton
when you did office olympics?

47:58.898 --> 48:00.865
It was awesome.
- Thanks, phyl.

48:00.867 --> 48:02.733
- I still have my medal
from that.

48:02.735 --> 48:04.602
- Do you even have
a mattress?

48:04.604 --> 48:07.939
- No, but I still have my medal
from that.

48:11.710 --> 48:13.744
- Oscar.

48:13.746 --> 48:16.547
Oscar.

48:16.549 --> 48:20.218
[crying]
I think I'm gay.

48:20.220 --> 48:22.553
- Why do you say that?
- [sniffles]

48:22.555 --> 48:25.456
It's just that
I'm so emotional.

48:25.458 --> 48:27.658
- Yeah, but you're not gay.
You're not gay.

48:27.660 --> 48:31.395
- No, but maybe the reason--
- you're not gay.

48:31.397 --> 48:35.900
- â™ª and all the faces
that I know â™ª

48:35.902 --> 48:40.571
â™ª have that same
familiar glow â™ª

48:40.573 --> 48:44.275
â™ª I think I must have known them
somewhere once before â™ª

48:44.277 --> 48:46.277
- How did you do it?

48:46.279 --> 48:48.613
How did you capture
what it was really like?

48:48.615 --> 48:51.782
How we felt and how we made
each other laugh

48:51.784 --> 48:53.684
And how we got
through the day?

48:53.686 --> 48:55.786
How did you do it?

48:55.788 --> 48:57.855
Also, how do cameras work?

48:57.857 --> 48:59.757
- Every day
when I came into work,

48:59.759 --> 49:02.860
All I wanted to do
was leave.

49:02.862 --> 49:05.796
So why in the world does it feel
so hard to leave right now?

49:05.798 --> 49:08.566
- It all seems
so very arbitrary.

49:08.568 --> 49:11.302
I applied for a job
at this company

49:11.304 --> 49:12.970
Because they were hiring.

49:12.972 --> 49:14.839
I took a desk at the back

49:14.841 --> 49:16.807
Because it was empty.

49:16.809 --> 49:18.876
But...
[chuckles]

49:18.878 --> 49:22.346
No matter how you get there
or where you end up,

49:22.348 --> 49:25.283
Human beings have
this miraculous gift

49:25.285 --> 49:28.853
To make that place home.

49:36.028 --> 49:38.562
Let's do this.

49:39.965 --> 49:42.633
- I just feel lucky
that I got a chance to share

49:42.635 --> 49:44.802
My crummy story
with anyone out there

49:44.804 --> 49:46.671
Who thinks
they're the only one

49:46.673 --> 49:49.006
To take a dump
in a paper shredder.

49:49.008 --> 49:51.475
You're not alone, sister.

49:51.477 --> 49:53.377
Let's get a beer sometime.

49:53.379 --> 49:56.480
[indistinct chatter]

49:58.850 --> 50:01.018
- I'm happy
that this was all filmed,

50:01.020 --> 50:04.088
So I can remember everyone
and what we did.

50:05.824 --> 50:07.725
I worked for a paper company
all these years,

50:07.727 --> 50:11.696
And I never wrote
anything down.

50:11.698 --> 50:13.664
- That was so much fun.

50:13.666 --> 50:14.732
[indistinct chatter]

50:14.734 --> 50:16.033
- Bye, kev!

50:16.035 --> 50:18.336
- I sold paper at this company
for 12 years.

50:18.338 --> 50:20.838
My job was to speak
to clients on the phone

50:20.840 --> 50:23.841
About quantities
and types of copier paper.

50:23.843 --> 50:27.878
Even if I didn't love
every minute of it,

50:27.880 --> 50:33.718
Everything I have,
I owe to this job.

50:33.720 --> 50:35.786
This stupid...

50:35.788 --> 50:38.522
Wonderful...

50:38.524 --> 50:40.725
Boring...

50:40.727 --> 50:43.561
Amazing job.

50:43.563 --> 50:46.997
- I thought it was weird
when you picked us

50:46.999 --> 50:49.567
To make a documentary.

50:49.569 --> 50:52.536
But all in all...

50:52.538 --> 50:55.806
I think an ordinary paper
company like dunder mifflin

50:55.808 --> 50:59.877
Was a great subject
for a documentary.

50:59.879 --> 51:03.714
There's a lot of beauty
in ordinary things.

51:03.716 --> 51:06.784
Isn't that
kind of the point?
