WEBVTT

00:03.545 --> 00:06.006
I got the proposal in
just under the wire.

00:06.006 --> 00:10.385
If approved, it'll be enough
to upgrade every lab
at Midtown High, and‐‐

00:10.385 --> 00:11.762
[door opens]

00:11.762 --> 00:13.639
Sorry.
Just doing my rounds.

00:13.639 --> 00:16.099
It's good that
you're talking to him.

00:16.099 --> 00:17.643
That helps
with coma recovery.

00:17.643 --> 00:19.978
Any idea when
he might wake up?

00:19.978 --> 00:21.522
Hard to tell.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.274
But his brain waves, vitals‐‐
it all looks good.

00:24.274 --> 00:26.818
It might take a while,
but I'm sure
Doctor Octopus will‐‐

00:26.818 --> 00:29.112
Otto.
Excuse me?

00:29.112 --> 00:33.951
His name is Otto Octavius.
That other person‐‐
that's not him anymore.

00:33.951 --> 00:37.704
Sure. I better finish
my rounds.

00:42.668 --> 00:46.213
[clicks]
<i>...the scene only moments ago</i>
<i>as Spider‐Man,</i>

00:46.213 --> 00:49.007
<i>who, to everyone's surprise,</i>
<i>has actually</i>
<i>been helpful recently,</i>

00:49.007 --> 00:52.177
<i>was battling</i>

<i>using some kind of new costume</i>

00:52.177 --> 00:55.722
<i>against his enemy's</i>

00:55.722 --> 00:59.643
<i>But it wasn't enough</i>
<i>to stop this new menace.</i>

00:59.643 --> 01:02.145
<i>As you can see,</i>
<i>Spider‐Man disappeared‐‐</i>

01:02.145 --> 01:05.440

<i>right in front of our eyes.</i>

01:05.440 --> 01:08.652
<i>We've also had reports</i>

01:08.652 --> 01:10.279
Oh, no.

01:10.279 --> 01:12.781
Parker...

01:12.781 --> 01:16.952
Otto!
Anna Maria,
Spider‐Man needs help.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.206
[groans]

01:21.206 --> 01:23.000
Where am I?

01:23.000 --> 01:27.170
Well, the good news is...
I found the Avengers.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.507
They look alive and well,

01:30.507 --> 01:32.301
if a little
on the unconscious side,

01:32.301 --> 01:34.052
which is what I bet
is gonna happen to me

01:34.052 --> 01:36.346
if I stay in here
as long as they have.
Hulk!

01:36.346 --> 01:40.017
We gotta find a way
to get out of Regent's
bizarre portal world.

01:40.017 --> 01:42.769
Now is not the time
for a nap, big guy.

01:45.647 --> 01:48.650
Guess this is
all up to me.

01:48.650 --> 01:51.486
Look, Mr. Stark,
I don't know
exactly where we are,

01:51.486 --> 01:55.157
but if this place is anything
like my previous experience
with teleportation,

01:55.157 --> 01:57.075
then it's using ion interaction.

01:57.075 --> 01:59.995
Which means the negative ion
displacer I built

01:59.995 --> 02:04.583
could theoretically destabilize
the region's borders,
giving us a chance to get out.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.918
I'm gonna need
a lot more power.
[ascending whirring]

02:10.255 --> 02:14.301
Yes! I can check slicing
a hole in reality
off my bucket list!

02:14.301 --> 02:17.179
Ha! I really wish
you were awake to see that.

02:17.179 --> 02:19.640
Burnt out the displacer,
but at least we've got
a way out.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.684
[imitating Iron Man]
"Oh, good work, pajamas.
You're a genius."

02:22.684 --> 02:24.227
[in own voice]
"Aw, you're too kind."

02:24.227 --> 02:25.520
[whoosh]
Uh‐oh.

02:26.730 --> 02:28.732
It's not holding.

02:28.732 --> 02:30.567
Okay, maybe I'm glad
you're not awake to see this.

02:42.162 --> 02:46.041
We're not gonna make it in time.
Please have some juice left.

02:48.377 --> 02:51.296
Okay, Avengers,
this might come off
as a little clingy,

02:51.296 --> 02:54.508
but you all need
to come with me right now.

02:54.508 --> 02:57.386
[straining]

02:57.386 --> 03:00.138
Yes!

03:00.138 --> 03:03.225
Oh, come on!
Come on, come on, come on,

03:03.225 --> 03:05.394
come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on,
come on!

03:05.394 --> 03:07.354
[grunting]

03:07.354 --> 03:09.481
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on!

03:09.481 --> 03:11.316
[grunts]
Whoa!

03:11.316 --> 03:13.694
I'll find a way
to rescue you, Avengers.

03:13.694 --> 03:18.073
Right after I'm done
falling into the river!
[grunts]

03:18.073 --> 03:21.201
[ship horn blaring]

03:21.201 --> 03:24.246
Well, this suit is trashed.

03:24.246 --> 03:25.956
Literally.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.502
[Spider‐Man in spooky voice]
Yuri!
[gasps]

03:30.502 --> 03:33.255
It's the ghost
of Spider‐Man.

03:33.255 --> 03:34.798
[spooky vocalizing]

03:34.798 --> 03:36.383
Ohh.

03:41.012 --> 03:43.432
Hello. Miss me?

03:43.432 --> 03:46.518
I saw on the news
everyone thinks
Regent destroyed me.

03:46.518 --> 03:50.355
Yeah. I didn't know whether
to throw a memorial
or a celebratory parade.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.107
Ouch.
What happened to you?

03:52.107 --> 03:53.442
Ah, no biggie.

03:53.442 --> 03:55.444
Just teleported
to some weird dimension

03:55.444 --> 03:58.196
that was holding
all the Avengers.

03:58.196 --> 04:00.449
So you rescued them?
Yeah!

04:00.449 --> 04:02.576
Well, no, technically.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.162
It's harder to escape
another dimension
than you think.

04:05.162 --> 04:07.372
But teleportation‐‐
that's on my list.

04:07.372 --> 04:11.209
What list?
Seeing the Regent in action
convinced me.

04:11.209 --> 04:13.962
This is the part
where you get to say,
"I told you so."

04:13.962 --> 04:16.214
I would never.
The Regent used

04:16.214 --> 04:18.383
several different powers
during your fight with him.

04:18.383 --> 04:21.303
Electricity like Electro.
Sand like Sand Girl.

04:21.303 --> 04:23.430
Teleportation like Cloak.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.016
Right. But he
also used ice powers,

04:26.016 --> 04:30.061
strange wind control,
and some green blast
that really hurt.

04:30.061 --> 04:31.938
[groans]
Still.

04:31.938 --> 04:35.484
You mean ice like Frostbite,
wind like Whirlwind,

04:35.484 --> 04:38.028
and those blasts like Paradox?

04:38.028 --> 04:40.280
[scoffs]
Never heard of these guys.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.073
That's because
you don't have access

04:42.073 --> 04:44.075
to the secure files
I've been researching.

04:44.075 --> 04:46.453
And all of them
have one thing in common.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.079
Care to guess?

04:48.079 --> 04:49.790
They're all being held

04:49.790 --> 04:52.459
in a certain super‐villain
prison called‐‐

04:52.459 --> 04:54.753
I don't know‐‐
the Cellar?

04:54.753 --> 04:57.339
Exactly.
They might not have escaped,

04:57.339 --> 05:00.675
but somehow Regent
is using all their powers.

05:00.675 --> 05:03.470
But you said the Cellar
couldn't be compromised.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.932
Well, maybe I...
wasn't right.

05:06.932 --> 05:09.726
Mm. Mm‐hmm.
Mm‐hmm. Mm‐hmm.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.728
[whispers]
I told you so.

05:14.356 --> 05:17.400
Nice ride.
Any chance I could drive?

05:17.400 --> 05:20.403
I don't ask
to shoot your webs.
TouchÃ©.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.572
I gotta admit, I'm surprised
your friend Augustus

05:22.572 --> 05:24.366
is letting us
inspect the Cellar.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.952
He doesn't believe his facility
has anything to hide.

05:26.952 --> 05:28.703
And I completely trust him.

05:28.703 --> 05:32.749
But that doesn't mean the prison
hasn't been compromised
from the outside.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.584
How far out is this place?

05:34.584 --> 05:36.920
I don't‐‐ Whoa‐ho‐ho!

05:39.005 --> 05:41.007
Never mind. Found it.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.512
Augustus.
Always good to see you.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.347
Likewise.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.308
And a pleasure to finally
meet you, Spider‐Man.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.727
Wish this were under
better circumstances,

05:52.727 --> 05:56.439
but I'm certain after
a personally guided tour
by Shannon and I,

05:56.439 --> 05:59.526
you will no longer
have any doubts
about the Cellar's security.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.611
Let's get started,
shall we?

06:03.363 --> 06:06.116
[Spider‐Man]
Electro, Molten Man, Sand Girl.

06:06.116 --> 06:08.493
Not exactly a meeting
of the Spider‐Man fan club.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.745
You have
nothing to fear.

06:10.745 --> 06:14.332
I designed these cells
to suppress the powers
of the occupants inside.

06:14.332 --> 06:17.502
They are harmless.
If this is
an ultra‐secure prison,

06:17.502 --> 06:20.463
where are all the guards?
Our security drones
are the guards here.

06:20.463 --> 06:24.092
They also deliver meals,
clean, and provide
medical scans.

06:24.092 --> 06:26.094
All computer controlled,
of course.

06:26.094 --> 06:29.097
Can I check out your system?
Take a look
at your security logs?

06:29.097 --> 06:31.516
No way. You're not
authorized to‐‐

06:31.516 --> 06:35.520
Of course you can.
Please grant him
special permission access.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.858
Whoa‐oa‐oa!
Time to touch stuff!

06:39.858 --> 06:42.944
As I said on the phone,
this Regent has powers
[Spider‐Man muttering]

06:42.944 --> 06:45.363
that exactly match
inmates here.

06:45.363 --> 06:47.699
I need to determine
what the connection is.

06:47.699 --> 06:49.451
I doubt there is one.
[Spider‐Man chuckles]

06:49.451 --> 06:51.328
Whoever this villain is,
[Spider‐Man muttering]

06:51.328 --> 06:53.747
he must have found a way
to mimic the powers of others.

06:53.747 --> 06:57.375
Hmm?
[Shannon]
It's possible the criminal
is intentionally using powers

06:57.375 --> 06:59.336
that seem to lead
back to the Cellar,
[grunting]

06:59.336 --> 07:02.380
as a way to mislead
your investigation.
Oh! [laughs]

07:02.380 --> 07:04.049
[digital buzzing]
Huh. Uh...

07:04.049 --> 07:05.925
Why are these
files blocked?

07:05.925 --> 07:08.261
Shannon should have
given you full access.

07:08.261 --> 07:11.389
[digital buzz]
Well, your database
doesn't seem to think so.

07:11.389 --> 07:15.560
Rude.
Shannon, are you sure you
gave him master authorization?

07:15.560 --> 07:17.562
Maybe a counter‐cross
decryption would‐‐
[digital buzz]

07:17.562 --> 07:19.856
[beeps]
There! Unlocked.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.486
[Yuri]
Are these schematics
for the Regent's gear?

07:24.486 --> 07:26.905
[Augustus]
How could this be in our system
without us knowing?

07:26.905 --> 07:29.074
The files were
created anonymously.

07:29.074 --> 07:30.617
But hold on.
[beeping]

07:30.617 --> 07:32.452
I found access
to an off‐site terminal

07:32.452 --> 07:34.454
where they originated.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.331
Who's User 21A9?

07:36.331 --> 07:38.458
There‐‐ Th‐There must
be some mistake.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.418
That's my access code.

07:40.418 --> 07:43.380
Then you're coming with me
to answer some questions,
Ms. Stillwell.

07:43.380 --> 07:46.841
It wasn't me.
Someone from outside must have
broken in using my code.

07:46.841 --> 07:49.094
Augustus,
you have to trust me.

07:49.094 --> 07:53.556
Shannon...
I want to believe you, but‐‐

07:53.556 --> 07:55.308
Go with Yuri for now.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.476
Let's go, Spider‐Man.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.270
No. The Avengers
were teleported

07:59.270 --> 08:01.606
using powers from
one of the villains here.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.441
I'm not leaving
until I find them.

08:03.441 --> 08:05.652
Consulting
the superpowers index.
[beeps]

08:05.652 --> 08:08.405
Teleportation.
Let's see.

08:08.405 --> 08:12.367
There's the Spot,
Cloak‐‐
Let's start with Cloak.

08:12.367 --> 08:15.036
Black Widow suspected him.
Do what you need to do, Yuri.

08:15.036 --> 08:18.039
Spider‐Man and I
will work here.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.752
[soft thudding]

08:22.752 --> 08:24.546
Wow, Electro. Ooh.
[thudding continues]

08:24.546 --> 08:26.548
Doesn't seem like
you're too happy to see me.

08:26.548 --> 08:28.550
Eh, well, understandable.

08:33.304 --> 08:34.931
You're Cloak, right?

08:34.931 --> 08:36.766
Don't pretend
you don't know me.

08:36.766 --> 08:38.685
Look, I can't see Dagg
from here.

08:38.685 --> 08:40.895
Can you tell me
if she's okay?
I think Regent

08:40.895 --> 08:43.314
used your powers
to capture the Avengers.

08:43.314 --> 08:45.108
You're going to help
get them back.

08:45.108 --> 08:47.110
Look, I don't know
what you're talking about,

08:47.110 --> 08:49.237
but my teleportation
doesn't work in here.

08:49.237 --> 08:51.740
These cells
only drain our powers.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.825
It's torture.
Drain?

08:53.825 --> 08:57.954
So the Regent's been using
your powers against your will?

08:57.954 --> 09:01.916
Augustus,
you designed these cells.
How could Shannon do that?

09:01.916 --> 09:05.170
Shannon didn't do anything
except take the fall.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.671
[laughing]
What?

09:09.090 --> 09:12.052
I warned you
to stay away, Spider‐Man,

09:12.052 --> 09:14.095
but you wouldn't let it go.

09:14.095 --> 09:15.513
And now you'll pay for it!
[ascending whirring]

09:20.477 --> 09:21.478
[ascending whirring]

09:21.478 --> 09:23.104
You're hurting them!

09:23.104 --> 09:24.147
[beeping]

09:24.147 --> 09:26.858
I'm giving them a purpose!

09:26.858 --> 09:28.485
Let me guess what that means.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.445
Electro‐blast! Called it.

09:31.696 --> 09:34.324
Dude, chill!
[grunts]

09:34.324 --> 09:37.660
Actually, uh, de‐thaw!
Ice off!
[yells]

09:40.789 --> 09:43.083
What's the deal,
Augustus?
You're so proud

09:43.083 --> 09:45.335
of these cells you designed,
you want to stay in one?

09:45.335 --> 09:47.879
Mine is the perfect plan,

09:47.879 --> 09:50.340
crafted through
years of patience,

09:50.340 --> 09:53.051
designed so
the so‐called Avengers

09:53.051 --> 09:55.553
would be subject
to my vengeance.

09:55.553 --> 09:58.848
What did
the Earth's Mightiest Heroes
ever do to you?

09:58.848 --> 10:01.142
I know most of them.
Pretty nice.

10:01.142 --> 10:04.354
Except Hulk when he's grumpy.
Or even when he's not.

10:04.354 --> 10:06.981
You never saw how
they treated my father.

10:06.981 --> 10:09.192
He may have made
a few criminal mistakes,

10:09.192 --> 10:11.569
but the Avengers
put him away for life.

10:11.569 --> 10:14.364
They took him from me!

10:14.364 --> 10:17.117
Wait. You built
a whole prison

10:17.117 --> 10:19.577
so you could steal powers
and work out your anger issues?

10:19.577 --> 10:23.039
[scoffs]
Like that plan wasn't
gonna fall apart.

10:23.039 --> 10:26.918
[imitating Regent]
"I'm the Regent, and my plans
are overly complicated."

10:26.918 --> 10:28.378
Nice!

10:28.378 --> 10:30.797
I love goading villains into
busting their own stuff.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.674
[grunts]
Not overly complicated.

10:32.674 --> 10:34.676
My plans have
already succeeded.

10:34.676 --> 10:37.512
I punished the Avengers
that hurt my father,

10:37.512 --> 10:40.181
and anyone else
that got in my way.

10:40.181 --> 10:41.724
Once I'm rid of you,

10:41.724 --> 10:44.102
I'll shut down
the Regent program

10:44.102 --> 10:46.396
and make sure Shannon
takes all the blame.

10:46.396 --> 10:48.398
[grunting]

10:48.398 --> 10:51.025
You are a terrible boss!
[grunts]

10:51.025 --> 10:52.944
[grunts]

10:53.945 --> 10:56.072
[grunts]

10:56.072 --> 10:57.782
[groaning]

10:57.782 --> 11:00.410
[ascending whirring]

11:00.410 --> 11:02.203
[laughing]

11:02.203 --> 11:03.413
[grunts]

11:05.290 --> 11:08.001
Everything
still looks normal.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.003
Of course.
He's still in a coma,

11:10.003 --> 11:12.046
so nothing's
different at all.

11:17.427 --> 11:20.138
[grunts]
Hurry.
Modulate the power coupling.

11:20.138 --> 11:21.931
Can't we just tell them
you're okay?

11:21.931 --> 11:23.725
Time is of the essence.

11:23.725 --> 11:27.103
If the doctors find me awake,
there will be
a barrage of tests.

11:27.103 --> 11:30.190
You seriously know
the identity of that guy
that attacked Spidey?

11:30.190 --> 11:32.150
Not precisely,
but it's clear

11:32.150 --> 11:35.486
every power he's used
belongs to an inmate
currently at the Cellar.

11:35.486 --> 11:39.073
How are you sure of that?
Because I wa‐‐

11:39.073 --> 11:43.203
I myself
was incarcerated there
last summer.

11:43.203 --> 11:47.165
I am afraid there is much
you do not know about me.

11:47.165 --> 11:49.500
I'm aware of your history,
Otto.

11:49.500 --> 11:53.129
But I'm also aware
that you are no longer
that person.

11:53.129 --> 11:57.467
You have faith
that I am a changed man?

11:57.467 --> 11:59.886
More of a hypothesis.

11:59.886 --> 12:02.180
Let's save Spider‐Man
so you can prove me right.

12:03.598 --> 12:05.141
[keyboard clacking]

12:05.141 --> 12:06.851
[straining]

12:06.851 --> 12:08.228
[grunts]

12:08.228 --> 12:10.188
Boy, this battle's
really heating up.

12:10.188 --> 12:12.899
Ha! I got a million
of 'em.

12:12.899 --> 12:15.109
[grunts]
[grunts, groans]

12:15.109 --> 12:18.238
Where are
your quips now?

12:18.238 --> 12:19.239
[grunts]

12:20.657 --> 12:21.658
[grunts]

12:26.454 --> 12:28.122
Dagger!

12:28.122 --> 12:30.416
Tandy, I swear I'll find
a way to get you out!

12:30.416 --> 12:34.629
Whoa‐oa‐oa!
[grunts, groans]

12:37.465 --> 12:40.260
Whoa!
You saved me!

12:40.260 --> 12:42.887
Are you sure you're really
one of the bad guys?

12:42.887 --> 12:47.183
[strained]
I can't keep teleporting
it forever.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.185
Too drained from the cell!

12:49.185 --> 12:51.020
You won't have to.
Look!

12:51.020 --> 12:52.939
His power's draining!
[grunting]

12:52.939 --> 12:56.234
[grunts]
That's it.
Just take a nice rest.

12:56.234 --> 12:58.653
[grunts]
Don't worry.

12:58.653 --> 13:02.198
Plenty more resources.
[ascending whirring]

13:02.198 --> 13:04.492
You only delay
the inevitable.

13:04.492 --> 13:07.203
We don't want
to be standing here when
the nega‐beams start flying.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.746
[Cloak]
I got you!

13:09.789 --> 13:12.125
Drones, find the prisoner Cloak!

13:12.125 --> 13:14.168
Dagger and I
didn't want any of this.

13:14.168 --> 13:17.130
Idea. You teleport him
into the empty cell,

13:17.130 --> 13:19.257
I web it shut,
then we go for nachos.

13:19.257 --> 13:21.342
I don't have
enough power.

13:21.342 --> 13:24.178
I need to free Dagger
so she can recharge me.
[drones approaching]

13:25.680 --> 13:28.182
There is no escape
from the Cellar.

13:28.182 --> 13:30.351
Drones, attack!

13:30.351 --> 13:33.688
[grunts]
Security, deactivate!

13:33.688 --> 13:35.398
Code AUR‐21!

13:35.398 --> 13:37.400
Are you friends
with these robots?

13:37.400 --> 13:39.360
Uh, not that I remember.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.155
<i>It is I</i>
<i>who command the drones,</i>
[yelps]

13:42.155 --> 13:44.198
<i>as if they were my minions!</i>

13:44.198 --> 13:47.535
Ock?! What?!
You're awake?

13:47.535 --> 13:50.163
And in my lenses?
They can't do that.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.248
<i>They could not until now,</i>

13:52.248 --> 13:54.542
<i>with Anna Maria's help.</i>
<i>Hi!</i>

13:54.542 --> 13:58.171
And with parts cannibalized
from spare medical equipment,

13:58.171 --> 14:02.133
we built a device that can
transmit directly to you.

14:02.133 --> 14:04.135
You broke into
the computer systems

14:04.135 --> 14:05.803
of the most secure
prison in the world

14:05.803 --> 14:07.805
<i>from your hospital bed?</i>

14:07.805 --> 14:10.349
Ugh. Save your adulation
for later.

14:10.349 --> 14:12.185
These drones merely
buy you time.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.228
I am accessing
the security doors

14:14.228 --> 14:16.064
to create the pathway
for your escape.

14:16.064 --> 14:18.524
<i>No. No escape.</i>
What?

14:18.524 --> 14:20.860
<i>Look what he's doing</i>
<i>to these inmates.</i>

14:20.860 --> 14:24.280
<i>They're suffering.</i>
<i>I have to stop the Regent,</i>
<i>not run.</i>

14:24.280 --> 14:27.742
That is foolhardy...
but noble.

14:27.742 --> 14:31.079
<i>Story of my life.</i>
<i>Can you open Dagger's cell?</i>

14:31.079 --> 14:35.291
Of course. But Cloak
and Dagger are criminals.
I would not trust them.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.919
<i>They might not be</i>
<i>as evil as you thought.</i>

14:37.919 --> 14:41.172
<i>And irony alert.</i>
<i>Ock, you are warning me</i>

14:41.172 --> 14:43.257
<i>not to trust villains.</i>
<i>You.</i>

14:43.257 --> 14:46.427
I recognize
the irony you speak of.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.179
Opening the cell now.

14:58.481 --> 14:59.732
Ty!

15:01.400 --> 15:03.444
I need your strength.

15:08.407 --> 15:10.993
[laughs]
Trying to power up?

15:10.993 --> 15:13.704
You haven't seen
a true power‐up yet.

15:15.790 --> 15:17.375
[ascending whirring]

15:17.375 --> 15:19.669
[gasps, grunts]
[Cloak yells]

15:19.669 --> 15:21.254
No.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.297
[electricity arcing]

15:23.297 --> 15:25.341
He's draining them all!

15:25.341 --> 15:27.552
[yells]
He has every superpower
at once!

15:30.555 --> 15:31.973
[grunts]

15:31.973 --> 15:35.184
He's a one‐man
Sinister Six...hundred!

15:37.603 --> 15:39.856
Aahh!

15:39.856 --> 15:42.233
[groaning]

15:44.777 --> 15:47.780
Look, Regent,
you're going to destroy them!

15:47.780 --> 15:52.660
I do what it takes
to reach my goals,
no matter the cost!

15:53.828 --> 15:55.830
[Dagger, Cloak grunt]

15:55.830 --> 15:57.874
<i>[Dr. Octavius]</i>
<i>The storage room</i>
<i>to the right! Now!</i>

16:00.251 --> 16:02.920
We're cornered!
Why would you send us here?

16:02.920 --> 16:05.715
[grunting]
<i>Because... this!</i>

16:05.715 --> 16:08.384
[Regent grunts]
I built this prison!

16:08.384 --> 16:11.137
You think you can hide
from me in here?
[blow lands on door]

16:11.137 --> 16:13.139
I saw the schematics
for Regent's gear.
[blow lands]

16:13.139 --> 16:15.099
It needed some kind
of central processor.
[blow lands]

16:15.099 --> 16:17.143
<i>[Dr. Octavius]</i>
<i>Umm, yes.</i>
[blow lands]

16:17.143 --> 16:19.312
<i>We see it!</i>
<i>A transmitter.</i>
[blow lands]

16:19.312 --> 16:21.731
<i>Shut it down,</i>
<i>and you take away</i>
<i>the Regent's powers.</i>

16:21.731 --> 16:23.941
<i>Through here!</i>

16:23.941 --> 16:26.569
[grunting]

16:26.569 --> 16:29.530
[yells]

16:33.868 --> 16:36.579
<i>The route straight ahead</i>
<i>leads to the transmitter.</i>

16:36.579 --> 16:39.373
<i>To the left,</i>
<i>an emergency escape tunnel.</i>

16:39.373 --> 16:42.501
The Regent's
burning them out.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.712
They're villains,
but they're also human beings.

16:44.712 --> 16:47.215
That way
leads to escape,

16:47.215 --> 16:50.593
but that way gives us
a chance to stop the Regent.

16:50.593 --> 16:53.346
I can't make
the decision for you,
but I'm staying.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.723
Tiberius Stone
turned us into what we are.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.808
Treated us like pawns.

16:57.808 --> 17:01.020
We're not gonna run away
while someone exploits
other people.

17:01.020 --> 17:04.857
We're with you, Spidey.
Then come on!

17:10.988 --> 17:13.574
There!
That spire is his
power transmitter.

17:13.574 --> 17:15.910
We need to put it
out of commission.

17:15.910 --> 17:16.911
[grunts]

17:18.579 --> 17:20.456
[thunderous thud]

Whoa!
[grunts]

17:37.932 --> 17:40.309
[groans]

17:40.309 --> 17:43.688
You can't save them,
if that's what you think.

17:43.688 --> 17:45.982
I won't let you!
[Dagger grunts]

17:45.982 --> 17:49.360
[grunts]
<i>[Dr. Octavius] He is</i>
<i>choosing to focus on Cloak!</i>

17:49.360 --> 17:50.987
"Save them"?

17:50.987 --> 17:53.781
Maybe he doesn't mean
save the inmates he's draining.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.074
The Avengers!

17:55.074 --> 17:56.993
[grunts]

17:56.993 --> 18:00.037
When I saw them,
they were floating
in this dark void.

18:00.037 --> 18:03.165
Could've been
the pocket dimension
I pass through when I teleport.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.751
You remember.
It's where I sent you
when we first fought.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.920
Yeah. Right.
Can you get them back?

18:10.464 --> 18:13.009
[yells]
I don't have enough energy!

18:13.009 --> 18:15.970
You can do it, if I give you
every ounce of power I have.

18:15.970 --> 18:17.555
That could destroy you!

18:17.555 --> 18:20.933
To save the Avengers,
I'll take that risk.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.978
[Spider‐Man]
I'm buying you as much time
as I can!

18:23.978 --> 18:26.647
No!
Time's up!

18:28.608 --> 18:30.943
This ends now!

18:34.822 --> 18:38.200
Ha! Nega‐beams
combined with energy blasts

18:38.200 --> 18:40.536
were enough
to disintegrate them.

18:40.536 --> 18:43.205
You're completely alone
now, Spider‐Man.

18:50.504 --> 18:53.049
Not from
where I'm standing.

18:53.049 --> 18:56.427
[grunts]
Noooo!

18:56.427 --> 18:58.846
I destroyed you!

18:58.846 --> 19:00.931
I'd get
a second opinion on that.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.391
Avengers Assemble!

19:03.392 --> 19:05.394
[grunting]

19:12.068 --> 19:14.987
Iron Man,
take down that force field,
and we can stop this!

19:15.988 --> 19:16.989
[grunts]

19:25.456 --> 19:27.625
[descending whirring]

19:27.625 --> 19:29.335
No!

19:29.335 --> 19:31.587
My plan was perfect!

That's for throwing Hulk!

19:38.636 --> 19:41.764
Yes!
Team‐up of the century!

19:41.764 --> 19:44.350
Up top. Anyone?

19:44.350 --> 19:47.520
Anyone.
[groans]

19:47.520 --> 19:49.230
Thanks for
saving our lives,

19:49.230 --> 19:51.440
even if you have been
a big jerk lately.

19:51.440 --> 19:54.151
About that.
What if I told you

19:54.151 --> 19:56.362
an evil villain
swapped minds with me?

19:56.362 --> 19:59.365
I knew it was
something like that!

19:59.365 --> 20:00.866
My guess was aliens.

20:00.866 --> 20:04.245
So, we're cool?
You believe me?

20:04.245 --> 20:06.664
Hello! I'm an Avenger.

20:06.664 --> 20:09.083
We see way weirder stuff
than that.

20:09.083 --> 20:10.376
So, yeah. We're cool.

20:14.338 --> 20:16.340
Good work out here today,
soldiers.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.634
Always good
to meet new heroes.

20:18.634 --> 20:21.011
"Heroes"?

20:21.011 --> 20:24.390
<i>Shannon Stillwell</i>
<i>is no longer under suspicion,</i>

<i>That's justice for ya.</i>

20:34.483 --> 20:35.860
Oh.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.987
Hey, he's‐‐
He's suddenly awake.

20:37.987 --> 20:41.157
I'll get the doctors!

20:41.157 --> 20:43.617
Peter! Good to see you
in one piece.

20:43.617 --> 20:48.414
I know this is strange,
but I wanted to say...

20:48.414 --> 20:52.209
Ock, despite everything
you did to me,

20:52.209 --> 20:55.713
if it weren't for your help,
I wouldn't have gotten out
of there alive.

20:55.713 --> 20:58.132
Maybe no one would have.

20:58.132 --> 20:59.842
Hmm.
[clears throat]

20:59.842 --> 21:01.802
Gratitude is unnecessary.

21:01.802 --> 21:05.556
You saved my life
when you brought
my consciousness back here,

21:05.556 --> 21:09.560
so I...
[cleared throat]
merely repaid my debt.

21:09.560 --> 21:13.856
I think the words
you're looking for are,
"You're welcome, Peter."

21:15.775 --> 21:18.778
You are welcome, Peter.

21:26.702 --> 21:28.120
Welcome back, Ock.
