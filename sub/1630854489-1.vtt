02:01.500 --> 02:03.250
Have you spoken
to Mama recently?

02:03.333 --> 02:05.041
I feel like she's avoiding me.

02:06.333 --> 02:09.375
I can't speak for your mom,
she's an adult and does what she wants.

06:24.083 --> 06:26.541
No, Fikile,
stop with the questions.

06:29.916 --> 06:30.833
Mom?

06:53.916 --> 06:55.416
You're home, my child.

07:13.291 --> 07:14.250
My child.

07:15.375 --> 07:16.750
Don't give up on her.

07:18.750 --> 07:21.083
Some things are hard
to discuss with children.

08:49.916 --> 08:52.291
- Hello, Aunty.
-Lunga, hello.

08:57.458 --> 08:58.708
Ah, no problem.

09:24.291 --> 09:27.208
And I-- Ooh!
So, where is Mr. Julius?

10:02.791 --> 10:04.416
-No, Fikile.
-No, Dad.

10:15.375 --> 10:16.916
Don't talk like that, Fikile.

14:15.208 --> 14:20.083
-So, how are things?
-This place's better than the other place.

14:25.208 --> 14:26.375
I'll be back.

20:08.541 --> 20:11.041
Thai, Indian,
or you will have a burger?

20:20.250 --> 20:21.541
Bhelekazi, my child,

20:23.250 --> 20:28.375
every family has a bad year.

20:30.750 --> 20:35.375
But this coming new year,

20:36.666 --> 20:39.333
uh, will be much better for us, okay?

26:07.041 --> 26:08.916
What can I help you with?

34:13.333 --> 34:14.375
My child…

38:20.708 --> 38:22.083
What's happening here?

38:24.041 --> 38:25.333
Is this even packing?

38:33.041 --> 38:38.000
I mean, it's a beautiful place
to advance your career prospects.

39:03.666 --> 39:04.875
Sometimes in life…

39:23.041 --> 39:26.458
We women have to give up
a lot more for our aspirations, don't we?

39:37.250 --> 39:39.750
I guess, my baby,
what I'm trying to say

39:40.458 --> 39:45.875
is that aspiration is relative
to time and life stages.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.083
Um, and pack better.

47:33.125 --> 47:36.625
I'm leaving.
I need a couple weeks to clear my head.

47:36.708 --> 47:38.375
I forbid you to leave this house!
