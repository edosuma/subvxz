- Can I say what I loved

06:13.783 --> 06:14.949
about your voice?

06:14.950 --> 06:18.849
You have, like, the vibrato,
the sweetness,

06:18.850 --> 06:21.249
and I just did a country song
with Blake Shelton.

06:21.250 --> 06:23.416
Quit dropping my name.

06:23.417 --> 06:27.816
Oh, my God. We get it.
You love him.
But, seriously, like,
who cares about genre?

all kinds of music.

I have a good idea.

06:37.283 --> 06:39.816
Because Gwen and Blake
have this sensitive new thing

06:39.817 --> 06:41.282
where, like, they're gonna
get mad at each other

06:41.283 --> 06:42.482
if you pick
either one of them,

06:42.483 --> 06:45.049
that means you should probably
go with Alicia, right?

06:45.050 --> 06:47.382

06:47.383 --> 06:48.782

06:58.517 --> 07:00.249

are coming out of you.

And I think that's actually
what makes it interesting.

07:02.383 --> 07:05.016
So, let me ask you a question.
Why Nashville?

07:05.017 --> 07:06.782
Ashley: I love country music,
obviously.

07:06.783 --> 07:08.249
I'm also a songwriter.

07:08.250 --> 07:10.482
That's one of the best places
to go and do that.

07:10.483 --> 07:12.816
I had gigged in Miami
for four years,

07:12.817 --> 07:14.282
but I wanted something more.

07:14.283 --> 07:16.282
So how long
have you been there now?

07:16.283 --> 07:17.416
Just like a couple months.

07:17.417 --> 07:19.049
I love
hearing about your writing

07:19.050 --> 07:20.949
because that's
the blood of Nashville.

07:20.950 --> 07:22.749
And country music
is a sacred thing.

07:22.750 --> 07:24.782
Oh, God.
I would hate to see you...

07:24.783 --> 07:28.382
Throw it all away
and go with another team.
I'd hate to see you
become an experiment.

07:28.383 --> 07:29.749

09:42.008 --> 09:43.107
I'm 31 years old.

09:43.108 --> 09:45.641
I grew up in
the U.S. Virgin Islands.

09:45.642 --> 09:46.874
It's 32 square miles,

09:46.875 --> 09:49.307
and it's kind of like
a vacation every day.

09:49.308 --> 09:51.807
My mom always played music
around the house...

09:51.808 --> 09:53.874
calypso, soca, reggae.

09:53.875 --> 09:56.907
The reason I don't speak with
an accent when I'm in the U.S.

09:56.908 --> 09:58.707
is because
if I talked like this...

09:58.708 --> 09:59.941

10:02.008 --> 10:03.574
[Normal voice]
During college,

10:03.575 --> 10:05.907
me and a friend started a group
called Them Island Boys,

10:05.908 --> 10:09.041
and we were a mesh of pop,
hip-hop, and R&B.

I decided to move to Florida

10:14.075 --> 10:15.507

10:24.942 --> 10:26.407
What I love about my job

10:26.408 --> 10:29.741
is it gives me an opportunity
to help people and save lives.

10:29.742 --> 10:32.641
My daily shift
at my fire station is 24 hours,

10:32.642 --> 10:35.174
so music is kind of
on the back burner.

10:35.175 --> 10:37.274
I'm super happy
out here with you my clan.

10:37.275 --> 10:38.774

- Wait, are you lea...
- Wow.

38:53.842 --> 38:55.041
[Laughs]

38:55.042 --> 38:56.607
Alicia: Listen to me.

38:56.608 --> 38:58.874
I would suggest...

38:58.875 --> 39:00.274
for you to focus on

39:00.275 --> 39:03.574
the two newer, fresher,
more exciting women...

39:03.575 --> 39:05.907
Casi. Wait a minute.
Don't throw me in that.
...that are before you.

39:05.908 --> 39:07.241
You know what I mean?

39:07.242 --> 39:10.107
Because I think
what happens is...

39:10.108 --> 39:12.707
Adam, come sit with me.
It's gonna be okay.

39:12.708 --> 39:14.274
I just need to be left alone
right now!

39:14.275 --> 39:16.241
Adam!
[Laughter]

39:16.242 --> 39:17.507
I am not tired.

39:17.508 --> 39:19.841
I feel like
I'm just in my prime.

39:19.842 --> 39:21.107
[Cheers and applause]

39:21.108 --> 39:22.974
Casi, when my chair
turned around,

39:22.975 --> 39:25.341
you looked me like,
"You better turn around."

39:25.342 --> 39:26.607
You did take a second.

39:26.608 --> 39:28.607
But when you started,

39:28.608 --> 39:30.941
because I know that song
so well...

39:30.942 --> 39:33.241
that song
was an instant classic.

39:33.242 --> 39:36.275
[Laughter]

39:39.842 --> 39:41.642
[Cheers and applause]

39:43.442 --> 39:46.241
What you did to this room
and all four of us coaches

39:46.242 --> 39:47.774
is the same thing
that happened

39:47.775 --> 39:49.907
when LeAnn Rimes came out
with that song.

39:49.908 --> 39:51.107
Somebody yodels?

39:51.108 --> 39:53.874
The fact that you have
already mastered that,

39:53.875 --> 39:58.807
I am not giving up
until Casi is on my team,

39:58.808 --> 40:02.274
because this is
meant to freakin' be.

40:02.275 --> 40:04.741
It is.
[Chuckling] Thank you.

40:04.742 --> 40:09.441
The most shocking thing
would be for you to choose me,

40:09.442 --> 40:15.141
so that we could absolutely
create magic moments together,

40:15.142 --> 40:19.107
exploring music
that does what you just did.

40:19.108 --> 40:20.341
And if, for some reason,

40:20.342 --> 40:24.107
you didn't want to shock
the world and choose me...

40:24.108 --> 40:26.607
shock the world
and choose Gwen.

40:26.608 --> 40:33.107
Because you're going to be able
to get two for one.

40:33.108 --> 40:34.974
- Ooh.
- I did have that thought.

40:34.975 --> 40:39.007
But I have sang in all genres,
so I'm not just country.

40:39.008 --> 40:40.741
What kind of record, like,
would you want to make?

40:40.742 --> 40:43.874
I love country music,
but maybe kind of a mixture.

40:43.875 --> 40:45.774
I don't know.
Pop, rock... I don't know.

40:45.775 --> 40:48.907
I'm... I'm ready to see where...
where this show takes me,

40:48.908 --> 40:50.841
despite the yodeling.

40:50.842 --> 40:53.141
- Yeah! Come on! Yes!
- [Laughs]

40:53.142 --> 40:55.341
I'd like to retract some
of my previous statements.

40:55.342 --> 40:57.907
[Laughter]

40:57.908 --> 41:00.541
Those were the rantings
of a madman. I...

41:00.542 --> 41:02.241
I, uh...

41:02.242 --> 41:06.207
I've changed.
I've changed, Casi.

41:06.208 --> 41:07.674
I accept that.

41:07.675 --> 41:10.374
I'm a new man!

41:10.375 --> 41:13.042
[Cheers and applause]

41:16.808 --> 41:18.674
What if you chose me?
That's crazy!

41:18.675 --> 41:22.374
Like, why would you do that?
That's the worst decision ever.

41:22.375 --> 41:23.907
Or is it
the best decision ever?

41:23.908 --> 41:25.141
[Laughter]

41:25.142 --> 41:27.607
I don't know. I can't tell.
You decide.

41:27.608 --> 41:29.874
Okay, so who do you pick
as your coach?
