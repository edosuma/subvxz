One, two, three.

00:37.265 --> 00:38.315
Okay.

00:38.383 --> 00:40.217
Okay. Great.
All right.

00:40.302 --> 00:41.435
Don't do that.
Don't do what?

00:41.503 --> 00:43.437
Once you get up,
don't look down at your feet.

00:43.505 --> 00:45.639
How am I supposed to
know where my feet are

00:45.690 --> 00:48.609
if I can't look down at 'em?
Let's do it again.

00:48.677 --> 00:51.979
All right, I feel like a goof.

00:52.047 --> 00:54.715
Okay, I mean, am I gonna
actually surf at any point

00:54.783 --> 00:56.951
during this surfing lesson, or no?
Yeah, but you got to master the basics.

00:57.018 --> 00:58.536
I don't care
about the basics.

00:58.620 --> 01:00.121
I'm doing this 'cause Grace
wants to learn how to surf,

01:00.188 --> 01:02.189
and I figure, it'd be a nice
thing for me to do with her.

01:02.257 --> 01:03.707
Okay, and I'm
positive that this

01:03.792 --> 01:05.191
is not what she had in mind.
Okay.

01:05.242 --> 01:06.727
Okay, okay. You think you're ready?
Of course I'm ready.

01:06.795 --> 01:07.995
Come on.

01:08.063 --> 01:10.164
Okay, go catch a wave, brah.

01:14.886 --> 01:18.072
Maybe we can just work on
the basics this much more.

01:18.140 --> 01:19.840
Okay? And then
we'll go.

01:22.427 --> 01:25.012
What the hell is that?
It's a tsunami warning.

01:25.080 --> 01:26.714
It's a tsunami...?
Are you kidding me?

01:26.781 --> 01:28.349
We have to evacuate
the area now. Come on.

01:28.400 --> 01:29.934
Hey, get out of here.
You move!

01:30.018 --> 01:32.520
Danny, come on.
Let's get out of here.

01:32.587 --> 01:34.188
MAN
Attention.

01:34.239 --> 01:35.923
This is a mandatory evacuation.
Okay, let's go!

01:35.991 --> 01:37.391
Move away from the beach.

01:39.578 --> 01:41.946
This a mandatory evacuation.
Move away from the beach.

01:42.030 --> 01:44.265

02:34.466 --> 02:35.616
Okay.
Where's the point of origin?

02:35.684 --> 02:37.251
What's the ETA
of the first wave?

02:37.302 --> 02:38.919
Tsunami warning buoys
picked up the wave

02:38.970 --> 02:41.121
about a hundred miles
northeast of Wake Island.

02:41.189 --> 02:43.023
They think it was triggered
by a deep ocean landslide.

02:43.091 --> 02:45.593
ETA on the first set of waves
is, like, three hours.

02:45.660 --> 02:49.346
Yes. Sir, I can be there in ten.

02:49.431 --> 02:50.698
Yes, Governor,
I'll be there five.

02:52.701 --> 02:53.801
Competitive much?

02:53.868 --> 02:54.985
It's a curse.

02:55.070 --> 02:57.238
Command's called all
personnel back to base.

02:57.305 --> 02:59.907
We're gonna take the fleet out
to deep waters and ride it out.

02:59.974 --> 03:02.192
Huh. Must be nice.

03:02.277 --> 03:03.611
I guess the rest of us

03:03.662 --> 03:05.746
who don't have a seat
on an aircraft carrier--

03:05.813 --> 03:07.665
we'll just have
to get our snorkels out.

03:07.749 --> 03:09.816
Mmm. Be careful
today, okay?

03:09.868 --> 03:11.869
Yeah. You, too.

03:42.083 --> 03:44.184
Two lanes.
Here, this way. Here we go.

03:44.235 --> 03:45.853
Hey, everything is
gonna be okay, monkey.

03:45.920 --> 03:47.371
I promise you that.
It's good news.

03:47.455 --> 03:49.290
We get a day off of
school, that's all.

03:49.357 --> 03:51.492
Well, my friend Tommy said
the waves can get

03:51.543 --> 03:54.228
as tall as buildings
and go as fast as race cars.

03:54.296 --> 03:55.396
Oh, he did, huh?

03:55.463 --> 03:56.664
Well, Tommy also told you

03:56.715 --> 03:58.899
that he killed a tiger
shark with a boogie board.

03:58.967 --> 04:01.368
Okay, Tommy is what I like
to call a pathological liar.

04:01.419 --> 04:03.704
So from now on, we are
gonna put the closed sign

04:03.772 --> 04:05.572
on our ears when
Tommy talks, okay?

04:05.640 --> 04:06.974
Tommy.

04:07.042 --> 04:08.475
Tommy's a goof, babe.

04:10.945 --> 04:13.480
What's up?

04:13.548 --> 04:14.948
Hey, I need you to meet me

04:15.016 --> 04:17.084
at the Tsunami Warning Center
at Ewa Beach, all right?

04:17.152 --> 04:18.235
What? Right now?

04:18.320 --> 04:20.019
Yeah. Now.
The head of the Center,

04:20.088 --> 04:21.855
a Dr. Norman Russell,
has gone missing.

04:23.158 --> 04:24.291
Hey, you there?

04:24.359 --> 04:25.909
Yeah. It's just, I got Grace,

04:25.994 --> 04:28.612
and, um, Stan and Rachel
are out of town.

04:28.697 --> 04:31.332
You got anybody to watch her?

04:31.399 --> 04:33.450
No, I don't.
Why? You got anything in mind?

04:33.535 --> 04:36.103
Yeah.

05:08.269 --> 05:10.204
Howzit, bruddah?

05:10.271 --> 05:12.439
You got a high-priority
assignment for me.

05:12.490 --> 05:13.741
High-pri... Yeah.

05:13.792 --> 05:15.509
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

05:15.577 --> 05:17.461
He looked after
my sister.

05:17.545 --> 05:19.179
Yeah, I know,
and your sister ran away.

05:19.247 --> 05:21.498
Hey. That's <i>bulai,</i> brah.
She tricked me.

05:21.583 --> 05:22.783
Playing on my

05:22.834 --> 05:23.950
emotional
vulnerabilities.

05:24.002 --> 05:25.335
That part's true.
Shut up, you.

05:25.420 --> 05:27.121
And besides,
I'm great with <i>keikis.</i>

05:27.188 --> 05:28.288
I got this.

05:28.356 --> 05:29.790
Uh-huh.

05:29.858 --> 05:31.658
Baby, you remember Kamekona
from Christmas?

05:31.726 --> 05:32.843
Yeah? What do you say?

05:32.927 --> 05:34.061
I mean, word on the street is,

05:34.128 --> 05:35.295
he's a lot of fun.

05:35.346 --> 05:36.864
You want to go hang out
with him for a little bit?

05:36.931 --> 05:38.832
But I want to stay with you.

05:38.900 --> 05:39.867
That's understandable.

05:39.934 --> 05:42.820
But listen.

05:42.904 --> 05:44.971
You're gonna go play
at his house for a little while

05:45.023 --> 05:46.156
because it's really far away
from the water.

05:46.241 --> 05:48.442
Okay? And that's what
I want you to do.

05:48.493 --> 05:49.576
Hmm?

05:49.644 --> 05:50.861
The second
we get this thing figured out,

05:50.945 --> 05:52.880
which will be very soon--
I can assure you that--

05:52.947 --> 05:55.032
I'm gonna come back, and
I'm gonna get you, I promise.

05:55.116 --> 05:56.216
Okay? Is that okay?

05:56.284 --> 05:57.451
Okay.

05:57.502 --> 05:59.953
You like shave ice,
Grace? Killahz.

06:00.021 --> 06:01.622
I've been working
on some new flavors.

06:01.689 --> 06:03.190
I need a taste-tester.

06:03.258 --> 06:05.292
You down with helping me out?

06:05.343 --> 06:07.511
Yeah.
Awesome...

06:07.595 --> 06:09.546
All right. I love you.

06:09.631 --> 06:11.732
Love you
too, Danno.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.167
You got, uh, seat belts?

06:13.234 --> 06:14.435
Danny...

06:14.502 --> 06:15.769
No worry. No worry.

06:15.837 --> 06:17.104
Trust me, bruddah.

06:17.171 --> 06:18.372
Got your back.

06:18.440 --> 06:19.606
You guys know that.

06:19.674 --> 06:21.608
<i>Oy vay.</i>

06:21.676 --> 06:23.110
All right,
tell me something.

06:23.178 --> 06:26.313
Why is it that we're not helping
thousands of people evacuate?

06:26.364 --> 06:28.115
Instead, we're looking
for one missing person.

06:28.183 --> 06:30.451
Because, Danny, that one
person is responsible

06:30.518 --> 06:33.070
for making sure those
thousands of people are safe.

06:33.154 --> 06:34.855
All right, fair enough.
Define missing.

06:34.923 --> 06:36.406
Missing as in,
hasn't been seen

06:36.491 --> 06:38.158
or heard from since last night.

06:38.209 --> 06:40.244
Chin and Kono are checking
his house right now.

06:48.203 --> 06:49.970
Look, Sheldon, there's a big
difference between evacuating

06:50.038 --> 06:51.538
at a level one
and a level three.

06:51.606 --> 06:54.424
You need to make the call.
I need more time with the data.

06:54.509 --> 06:57.110
Dr. Russell's usually the one
who defines the inundation zone.

06:57.178 --> 06:59.563
But Dr. Russell isn't here,
so today, it's your job. I...

06:59.647 --> 07:01.381
Excuse me.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

07:01.432 --> 07:03.417
I'm Lieutenant Commander
Steve McGarrett from Five-O.

07:03.485 --> 07:04.318
This is Detective
Danny Williams.

07:04.385 --> 07:06.153
We're investigating

07:06.220 --> 07:08.438
the disappearance of Dr. Russell.
Sheldon Tunney, Deputy Director.

07:08.523 --> 07:10.157
Commander Sam Hale.
Coast Guard.

07:10.225 --> 07:12.526
You'll have to excuse me,
but we need to move now.

07:12.577 --> 07:14.862
So if you're not going
to make the call, I will.

07:16.097 --> 07:17.748
Better to be safe than sorry.

07:17.832 --> 07:19.333
I'm declaring it a level three.

07:24.289 --> 07:25.622
Oh, sorry about that.

07:25.707 --> 07:27.674
Lot of confusion around here
without Dr. Russell.

07:27.742 --> 07:31.144
Okay, look, I see a room
full of scientists.

07:31.212 --> 07:33.263
What is so important about
Dr. Russell? I'm just curious.

07:33.348 --> 07:35.582
Let's talk in my office.

07:36.918 --> 07:38.936
Look, normally, there
are a number of us

07:39.020 --> 07:40.854
who can interpret
the data

07:40.922 --> 07:42.439
we're receiving from
the warning buoys.

07:42.524 --> 07:45.359
But the stuff we're getting now
is riddled with anomalies.

07:45.426 --> 07:47.511
Anom... What kind
of anomalies?

07:47.579 --> 07:50.597
Wave height, water pressure,
barometric shift.

07:50.665 --> 07:51.798
They all affect the calculations

07:51.866 --> 07:53.967
as to the size and magnitude
of the wave,

07:54.035 --> 07:55.802
and they're all over the map.

07:55.870 --> 07:57.487
Okay, I'm a visual learner.

07:58.489 --> 08:01.308
Okay, uh, here. Look.

08:03.444 --> 08:05.746
This is a simulation
based on our most recent data.

08:05.813 --> 08:07.915
In the previous set of data,
the wave

08:07.982 --> 08:09.349
was about half the size,

08:09.417 --> 08:10.751
but before that,
it was off the charts.

08:10.818 --> 08:12.636
Ever since the buoy triggered

08:12.704 --> 08:15.422
at 5:00 a.m., there's been
no discernible pattern.

08:15.490 --> 08:17.157
The data keeps changing.

08:17.225 --> 08:19.009
What about the other
warning centers?

08:19.093 --> 08:20.394
Are you consulting
with them?

08:20.461 --> 08:22.429
We're the main center
for the entire Pacific Rim.

08:22.497 --> 08:23.697
We checked with our
satellite center in Alaska,

08:23.765 --> 08:24.815
but they're receiving

08:24.899 --> 08:25.983
conflicting data, as well.

08:26.067 --> 08:27.150
Okay, so what

08:27.235 --> 08:28.352
you're telling me is,
all you people--

08:28.436 --> 08:29.770
you have no idea
what's coming at us?

08:29.837 --> 08:31.104
Is that right?

08:31.155 --> 08:32.539
I can make an educated guess

08:32.607 --> 08:34.140
based on the most recent data.

08:34.207 --> 08:37.010
But we're talking about a wave
that could be the size

08:37.078 --> 08:38.345
of a three-story building,

08:38.413 --> 08:40.681
and traveling at the speed
of a jet plane.

08:40.748 --> 08:42.164
I don't want to guess.

08:42.250 --> 08:44.501
Well, looks like Tommy was
telling the truth for once.

08:44.586 --> 08:45.852
Who's Tommy?

08:45.920 --> 08:47.054
He's an eight-year-old boy.

08:47.121 --> 08:49.056
Okay, uh, so what
you're saying is,

08:49.123 --> 08:51.875
Dr. Russell could make
sense of all of this?

08:51.960 --> 08:53.594
If anyone could, it's him.

08:53.661 --> 08:55.862
He practically developed
this technology.

08:55.930 --> 08:57.998
He knows these waters
better than anyone.

08:58.066 --> 08:59.683
When's the last time
you spoke to him?

08:59.767 --> 09:03.136
Last night at about 5:00,
when we were leaving the office.

09:03.204 --> 09:05.839
And then at 6:00 a.m.,
I get a page that

09:05.907 --> 09:07.841
the first buoy had indicated
a tsunami.

09:07.892 --> 09:10.611
And protocol demands
that I consult with Dr. Russell

09:10.678 --> 09:12.813
before initiating any
of these emergency procedures,

09:12.880 --> 09:15.816
but he never contacted me, and
I couldn't get a hold of him.

09:15.867 --> 09:17.951
Guys, he lives for this stuff.

09:18.019 --> 09:19.419
He'd be the first person

09:19.487 --> 09:21.571
at this office
the minute his pager went off.

09:21.656 --> 09:22.789
Chin, what do you got?

09:22.857 --> 09:24.041
Looks like foul play, gentlemen.

09:24.125 --> 09:26.226
Forced entry.

09:26.294 --> 09:27.594
Signs of a struggle.

09:27.662 --> 09:29.496
Well, the neighbors
have been evacuated.

09:29.564 --> 09:32.666
But no disturbances have
been reported to HPD.

09:32.717 --> 09:35.035
So, Hawaii's top
Tsunami expert comes up missing

09:35.103 --> 09:37.137
on, uh... on the one day
that we need him?

09:37.204 --> 09:39.006
You know what they say
about coincidences.

09:39.073 --> 09:40.007
I don't.

09:40.074 --> 09:41.375
They usually take a lot
of planning.

09:42.343 --> 09:43.810
Okay, what do you think?

09:43.878 --> 09:44.978
This happened fast.

09:45.046 --> 09:47.347
They definitely came in
from there.

09:47.398 --> 09:49.316
I think he was sitting there,
got up.

09:49.384 --> 09:51.518
There was a struggle.
He came this way.

09:51.569 --> 09:53.086
He hit the wall.
Sorry, ma'am. Hold it right there.

09:53.154 --> 09:54.321
This is my father's house.

09:54.389 --> 09:56.189
And he hit the deck.
Blood trail goes that way.

09:56.257 --> 09:58.025
Looks like a lot of blood.

09:58.092 --> 09:59.276
Could be a gunshot wound.

09:59.360 --> 10:00.127
Gunshot wound?

10:00.194 --> 10:01.278
What happened?

10:01.362 --> 10:02.496
Where's my dad?

10:16.094 --> 10:18.629
Courtney, when was the last
time you spoke to your father?

10:18.697 --> 10:19.831
Last night
around 8:00.

10:19.898 --> 10:21.065
Okay. What were you guys
talking about?

10:21.133 --> 10:22.433
My physics final.

10:22.501 --> 10:24.218
I had a question
about free particles.

10:24.303 --> 10:27.138
And I was totally
lost, and he helped me.

10:29.641 --> 10:31.359
What?

10:31.443 --> 10:33.644
I would just really
hate it if the last time

10:33.712 --> 10:35.446
I talked to my father
was about physics.

10:35.514 --> 10:37.548
Do you remember anything else

10:37.616 --> 10:39.417
he said? Uh, doesn't matter

10:39.484 --> 10:40.785
how trivial
it seemed.

10:40.853 --> 10:43.588
Uh, we talked about going
for a hike this weekend.

10:43.655 --> 10:45.590
That's it.

10:45.657 --> 10:48.726
Um, he seemed totally,
you know, fine.

10:48.794 --> 10:50.494
But when the sirens went off
this morning,

10:50.562 --> 10:52.930
and I didn't hear from him,
I started to get worried.

10:54.132 --> 10:55.600
Who would want to hurt him?

10:55.667 --> 10:56.717
All right, listen.

10:56.802 --> 10:58.236
I promise you that we're doing

10:58.303 --> 10:59.670
everything we can to find
your father, but right now,

10:59.721 --> 11:02.073
you have to evacuate.

11:02.140 --> 11:04.041
I'm staying here.
I got it. I got it.

11:04.109 --> 11:05.276
Courtney,

11:05.344 --> 11:07.428
your father would want you
to be safe. I know that.

11:07.512 --> 11:09.730
All right? I'm going to have
an officer take you inland

11:09.815 --> 11:11.382
and the second I hear anything,

11:11.450 --> 11:12.683
you will be the first to know.

11:12.734 --> 11:13.784
You have my word, okay?

11:13.852 --> 11:15.653
Okay.

11:15.721 --> 11:17.722
All right?
Thank you.

11:41.763 --> 11:43.798
♪ ♪

11:49.521 --> 11:50.855
My friend Mark.
He's a very good guy.

11:50.923 --> 11:53.307
He'll take care
of you, all right?

11:54.559 --> 11:55.977
Okay, so what do we got?

11:56.061 --> 11:57.395
Skid marks and
white paint chips.

11:57.446 --> 11:58.929
Looks like someone pulled out
of the driveway fast

11:58.981 --> 12:01.482
and clipped Russell's car--
could be our kidnappers.

12:01.566 --> 12:03.734
There's only 100,000
white cars on the island.

12:03.785 --> 12:04.952
Good shape.

12:05.037 --> 12:06.120
What else?

12:06.204 --> 12:07.438
Hmm...

12:08.907 --> 12:09.940
Empty sandbag.

12:09.992 --> 12:11.325
It could be garbage,

12:11.410 --> 12:14.495
but one man's garbage
is another man's evidence.

12:14.579 --> 12:16.514
Let's grab it.

12:22.004 --> 12:25.339
So, I've accessed the TWC
security log

12:25.424 --> 12:26.691
to digitally retrace
Russell's last steps.

12:26.758 --> 12:29.961
It looks like he logged in
this morning at 5:32 a.m.

12:30.028 --> 12:31.295
That's about a half an hour

12:31.363 --> 12:33.314
before the first buoy
indicated a tsunami.

12:33.398 --> 12:35.900
Well, maybe he had an early
indication of the landslide.

12:35.968 --> 12:37.818
Do we have any idea
of what he saw?

12:37.903 --> 12:39.670
No. He didn't log in from
this computer, so I can't see

12:39.738 --> 12:41.038
what he was accessing.

12:41.106 --> 12:43.040
Wait a minute. If he didn't
log in from this computer,

12:43.108 --> 12:44.408
then maybe he'd
been taken already.

12:44.476 --> 12:46.810
Can we trace the IP address
from where he did log in?

12:46.862 --> 12:49.664
No. The security log
doesn't record IP addresses,

12:49.748 --> 12:52.049
but what it does record
are failed login attempts.

12:53.752 --> 12:55.786
Now, when he logged
in, he entered

12:55.854 --> 12:57.654
an incorrect password twice

12:57.706 --> 12:58.823
before entering
the correct one.

12:58.890 --> 13:01.375
Wait. Don't you mean
somebody else was trying

13:01.460 --> 13:02.543
to guess his password?

13:02.627 --> 13:03.828
That's what I thought
at first, too.

13:03.895 --> 13:05.563
But the incorrect
password that was entered

13:05.630 --> 13:07.465
was the same both times.

13:07.516 --> 13:09.433
Okay. And if somebody
was trying to log in,

13:09.501 --> 13:11.635
they would have been trying out
different passwords. Exactly.

13:11.687 --> 13:13.137
The other thing is,

13:13.188 --> 13:14.822
the incorrect password was
made of up four numbers:

13:14.890 --> 13:16.724
"1015."

13:16.808 --> 13:19.477
The real password
is "CourtneyRose."

13:19.528 --> 13:20.511
It's his daughter's name.

13:20.562 --> 13:22.046
Right. They're nothing alike.

13:22.114 --> 13:24.865
I think he entered the
wrong password on purpose.

13:24.950 --> 13:27.201
He was trying to send a message,
which means at 5:30,

13:27.285 --> 13:29.587
when he sent that message,
he was still alive.

13:33.992 --> 13:36.744
Okay, so at what point are we
going to follow the sane people

13:36.828 --> 13:38.212
and just get to high ground?

13:38.296 --> 13:41.698
As soon as we figure out what
message Dr. Russell was sending.

13:41.750 --> 13:44.552
Okay, we can't do that, uh,
I don't know, up on a mountain?

13:44.636 --> 13:46.003
Somewhere?
Ferris wheel? Building?

13:46.071 --> 13:47.505
Something high? Huh?

13:47.556 --> 13:49.557
Mamo, what's up?

13:49.641 --> 13:51.809
Brah, you got
to get these cops off my back.

13:51.877 --> 13:53.394
They want me to board up
and get off the beach.

13:53.478 --> 13:54.812
Just do as they say, Mamo.

13:54.879 --> 13:56.230
Okay? There's a tsunami coming.

13:56.314 --> 13:57.314
It's not safe
to be on the beach.

13:57.382 --> 13:59.400
Steve, I was here in '60,

13:59.484 --> 14:01.152
'64, and '75.
I've seen 'em all.

14:01.219 --> 14:02.153
I know the water.

14:02.220 --> 14:04.772
There's no tsunami in her today.

14:04.856 --> 14:06.273
Okay, listen.
I hear you,

14:06.358 --> 14:07.942
but you got to get out of there,
just in case. All right?

14:08.026 --> 14:09.460
Okay, brah.
But I'm telling you.

14:09.528 --> 14:11.762
Somebody's blowing smoke
up somebody's <i>'okole.</i>

14:11.830 --> 14:13.030
Just be safe, Mamo.

14:14.533 --> 14:15.866
That's good.

14:15.934 --> 14:19.203
So, uh, Mamo doesn't think
that there's a tsunami.

14:19.271 --> 14:21.238
I guess not. But I mean, who
knows the water better than him?

14:21.306 --> 14:22.406
Scientists, Steven.

14:22.474 --> 14:25.709
Scientists that study
this type of thing, okay,

14:25.761 --> 14:28.379
that told us a tsunami's coming
in one hour and 27 minutes.

14:28.430 --> 14:30.297
These watermen have been
reading the waves

14:30.382 --> 14:32.083
for hundreds of years, Danny.

14:32.150 --> 14:35.086
I-I commend them for their
commitment. I really do.

14:35.153 --> 14:37.555
If Mamo wants to help,
why doesn't he use his insights

14:37.606 --> 14:39.140
and tell us
where Dr. Russell is.

14:39.224 --> 14:40.608
That would be insightful.

14:40.692 --> 14:42.560
You know what?

14:42.611 --> 14:43.778
This whole thing,
it doesn't add up.

14:43.862 --> 14:45.696
I mean, why would
anyone kidnap

14:45.764 --> 14:47.031
Dr. Russell?
It's not like he has

14:47.098 --> 14:49.283
any classified government
secrets or anything.

14:49.367 --> 14:50.534
Who benefits?

14:50.602 --> 14:52.936
Anybody selling
bottled water or gasoline.

14:54.456 --> 14:55.573
That was a joke, Steven.

14:55.624 --> 14:57.074
Wai, wait, wait. No, no, no.

14:57.125 --> 14:58.626
This isn't someone starting a
fire to empty a crowded theater.

14:58.710 --> 15:00.711
Okay? This is
a natural disaster.

15:00.779 --> 15:03.047
You cannot create a tsunami.

15:03.115 --> 15:06.450
That's right.
Unless you can.

15:11.723 --> 15:13.557
Where are you going?

15:13.625 --> 15:15.626
Back to the
Tsunami Warning Center.

15:20.665 --> 15:21.799
Did you pick up
Auntie Emele?

15:21.867 --> 15:23.267
Okay. Good.

15:23.318 --> 15:24.635
All right. Be safe, cuz.

15:24.703 --> 15:26.270
You didn't get
called in, did you?

15:26.338 --> 15:28.005
All right.

15:28.073 --> 15:30.107
How much more of the hospital
do you have to evacuate?

15:30.175 --> 15:32.076
Okay. Just be safe.

15:32.143 --> 15:33.527
Bye.

15:33.612 --> 15:34.912
Was that Malia?

15:34.980 --> 15:36.080
Yeah.

15:36.147 --> 15:38.048
How's Auntie Emele?
Fine.

15:38.116 --> 15:40.201
Have you seen Malia since we
ran into her at the hospital?

15:40.285 --> 15:43.954
You guys aren't getting
back together again, are you?

15:44.005 --> 15:46.874
Easy, cuz. I'm just checking
on the hospital's evacuation.

15:46.958 --> 15:48.325
Look, we have
to get somewhere

15:48.393 --> 15:49.960
on the failed password
and the paint chips.

15:50.028 --> 15:51.996
Everyone's already evacuated.
We may have to join them soon.

15:52.063 --> 15:53.631
Okay.

15:53.682 --> 15:54.698
How are the latest projections?

15:54.766 --> 15:55.866
Same as before.
All over the map.

15:55.934 --> 15:57.184
We're preparing for the worst.

15:57.269 --> 15:58.502
What's the latest
on Dr. Russell?

15:58.553 --> 16:00.104
We think we got a lead,
but we need to know.

16:00.171 --> 16:02.072
How does the early warning
system work?

16:02.140 --> 16:03.440
How do you get your information?

16:03.508 --> 16:05.176
Well, it's really
not that complicated.

16:05.243 --> 16:08.012
Hop up. Okay.

16:08.079 --> 16:09.079
Look.

16:09.147 --> 16:11.182
These markers
indicate the location

16:11.249 --> 16:12.700
of the tsunami warning buoys.

16:12.784 --> 16:14.518
The buoys record
information about the wave

16:14.586 --> 16:17.087
and send that data
to the GOES 11 satellite.

16:17.155 --> 16:19.206
And the GOES 11
transmits the data to us.

16:19.291 --> 16:20.241
Got it.

16:20.325 --> 16:22.359
Could you, uh,
maybe just simplify?

16:22.410 --> 16:23.527
Uh, 20 words or less.

16:23.578 --> 16:25.329
Like-Like
the field trip version?

16:25.380 --> 16:29.266
I don't know what that means.
All right.

16:29.334 --> 16:32.586
Buoys in the water get info.

16:32.671 --> 16:34.071
Send it to
the satellite.

16:34.139 --> 16:35.256
The satellite sends it here.

16:35.340 --> 16:36.873
Okay, that's all.
Was that so difficult?

16:36.925 --> 16:38.175
No.

16:38.226 --> 16:39.894
Question.
Is there a relay station

16:39.978 --> 16:41.145
that the signal passes through

16:41.213 --> 16:43.047
or any place that could
compromise the signal?

16:43.114 --> 16:45.583
No. It's a clean feed
from GOES 11 to us.

16:46.718 --> 16:48.269
Oh! You'll have to excuse me.

16:48.353 --> 16:50.254
Okay, thank you.
You've been very helpful. Yeah.

16:50.322 --> 16:52.156
How was that helpful?

16:52.223 --> 16:54.925
You just be quiet for a second,
okay? So the adults can think.

16:54.993 --> 16:57.628
Think? Think? Thinking?
Is that what that face means?

16:59.397 --> 17:00.631
STEVE
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

17:00.699 --> 17:01.966
What do you need?

17:02.033 --> 17:03.834
Why can't I just be calling
to say hello?

17:03.901 --> 17:07.454
Theoretically, it's possible.
Sure. But you never have before,

17:07.539 --> 17:09.006
and it seems
like a really odd time to start.

17:09.074 --> 17:11.458
That is a fair point.

17:11.542 --> 17:12.742
Uh, I need to know if
there's a second signal

17:12.794 --> 17:15.262
being transmitted
on the same frequency

17:15.347 --> 17:17.815
as the GOES 11 satellite.

17:17.882 --> 17:19.750
Sure.

17:19.818 --> 17:20.851
What's going on?

17:20.919 --> 17:21.935
I don't know yet.

17:22.020 --> 17:23.153
What?

17:23.221 --> 17:25.439
What are you talking about--
a second signal?

17:25.522 --> 17:28.392
Th-This.
I understand that.

17:28.443 --> 17:29.760
There's a buoy and
it goes to a satellite

17:29.811 --> 17:31.261
and the satellite goes here.
I understand that.

17:31.313 --> 17:33.447
But, Mr. Wizard, I'm curious.
Why do we care?

17:33.531 --> 17:35.399
Tunney was saying the data
kept changing this morning.

17:35.450 --> 17:36.784
Okay? What if it's changing

17:36.868 --> 17:38.602
because a false signal
is overriding

17:38.653 --> 17:39.653
the actual signal from space?

17:39.738 --> 17:40.955
This... space.

17:41.039 --> 17:43.774
So the buoys and
the satellite thingies...

17:43.825 --> 17:45.275
they're not...?

17:45.327 --> 17:47.795
Dr. Russell, Danny!
Dr. Russell!

17:47.879 --> 17:49.663
Why are you yelling at me?
Just...

17:49.748 --> 17:50.947
Steve?
Hey.

17:50.999 --> 17:52.683
Okay. You were right.
There is a second signal,

17:52.751 --> 17:54.518
and it's not coming from space.

17:54.586 --> 17:56.971
It's coming from a boat
in the Ala Wai Harbor.

17:57.055 --> 17:58.922
Okay, I need to know
if anybody is on the boat.

17:58.990 --> 18:00.290
Okay, can you get me thermals?

18:01.426 --> 18:03.727
Are you trying
to get me court-martialed?

18:03.795 --> 18:05.813
Come on. I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't important.

18:05.897 --> 18:07.998
Although, having you
on land more often

18:08.066 --> 18:10.000
would have its benefits.

18:10.068 --> 18:11.869
Okay, thermals are up.

18:11.936 --> 18:14.355
You got at least
one live body on board.

18:14.439 --> 18:15.639
Can you text me the coordinates?

18:15.690 --> 18:17.191
I can do you one better.

18:20.545 --> 18:23.146
It's the <i>Avery Claire,</i> slip 21.

18:23.198 --> 18:24.331
You're the best. Thank you.

18:24.416 --> 18:25.616
Steve,

18:25.684 --> 18:26.984
please tell me that you're
not even thinking

18:27.052 --> 18:28.452
of going out there, okay?

18:28.520 --> 18:30.287
This is right
in the path of the wave.

18:30.338 --> 18:32.256
It's okay. I got an hour.
There's plenty of time.

18:32.324 --> 18:33.374
I'll call you later, okay?

18:33.458 --> 18:35.325
Your theory.

18:35.377 --> 18:36.593
Dr. Russell was kidnapped

18:36.661 --> 18:37.928
to create a fake signal.

18:37.996 --> 18:39.530
Huh?

18:39.597 --> 18:41.515
What? No gold star?

18:41.599 --> 18:42.966
Let's go get the boat, okay?

18:43.034 --> 18:44.668
Wait. What if you're wrong?

18:44.719 --> 18:47.170
This is good. This is genius.

18:47.222 --> 18:48.722
Now we're driving towards the
water. This is your plan?

18:48.807 --> 18:50.007
This is your plan?

18:50.075 --> 18:51.725
Listen to me.
If I'm gonna die on this island,

18:51.810 --> 18:53.394
which I never should have
come to in the first place,

18:53.478 --> 18:55.012
your face is not
the last face I want to see.

18:55.080 --> 18:56.814
You understand that?
Respectfully, of course.

19:04.989 --> 19:06.540
I know you like it here.

19:06.624 --> 19:07.758
I like... Here?
I like...

19:07.826 --> 19:11.545
Incorrect. You are incorrect,
my friend.

19:11.629 --> 19:14.131
Then why the board, huh?

19:14.198 --> 19:15.466
I mean, did hell
freeze over?

19:15.533 --> 19:17.534
Did I actually miss out
on seeing you trying

19:17.585 --> 19:19.253
to get up on that thing?
No comment.

19:19.337 --> 19:20.754
All right? Let's stick
to a more pressing theory,

19:20.839 --> 19:22.639
as to why you think
Dr. Russell

19:22.707 --> 19:23.807
is in this boat.

19:23.875 --> 19:24.842
Because this is where

19:24.909 --> 19:25.926
the second signal
is coming from.

19:26.010 --> 19:27.044
The second signal?
Yeah.

19:27.112 --> 19:28.479
Oh. Okay. Well,
I hope you're right.

19:28.546 --> 19:29.880
Because if you are not,

19:29.931 --> 19:32.316
we are going to be sleeping
with the fishes, literally,

19:32.383 --> 19:34.151
in 45 minutes.

19:40.892 --> 19:42.609
Chin, go ahead.

19:42.694 --> 19:44.762
We've got a problem.
What is that?

19:44.829 --> 19:46.613
The wave just picked up speed--
it's coming in faster

19:46.698 --> 19:48.115
than they thought.
How much faster?

19:48.199 --> 19:49.366
It's coming right now.

19:54.005 --> 19:56.924
All right. Come on, Steve.
What are we doing? Let's go.

19:57.008 --> 19:58.542
Come on.

19:58.610 --> 20:00.611
It's not coming.

20:12.459 --> 20:13.693
It's not coming.

20:14.462 --> 20:16.063
The water's not receding.

20:16.102 --> 20:17.870
If the wave was coming,
the water would be receding.

20:17.937 --> 20:20.939
Nobody else... nobody else
finds that significant enough

20:21.007 --> 20:22.407
to call this thing off.

20:22.475 --> 20:24.226
Danny, there's nobody else here.
There's no one around.

20:24.310 --> 20:26.879
Nobody else knows
about the second signal.

20:58.211 --> 21:01.413
This is just a wild guess:
that's not Dr. Russell.

21:01.481 --> 21:03.799
Yeah. I don't think so.

21:13.793 --> 21:15.143
Hey!

21:46.693 --> 21:48.293
Okay. My work is done.

21:48.344 --> 21:49.511
Can we go now, please?

21:49.596 --> 21:51.597
Come on.

21:55.668 --> 21:56.802
Where's Dr. Russell?

21:56.869 --> 21:58.370
Look, could we...
Could we do this on land?

21:58.438 --> 21:59.605
Potentially maybe

21:59.656 --> 22:00.805
in one of these
tall buildings?

22:00.857 --> 22:01.973
Tenth floor?

22:02.025 --> 22:03.191
Please.
The tsunami's not real.

22:03.276 --> 22:04.676
Is it?
Maybe it's late.

22:04.744 --> 22:06.028
What if it's late?

22:06.112 --> 22:07.379
The Warning Center's
been picking up her signal,

22:07.447 --> 22:08.847
not the actual feed
from the satellite.

22:08.915 --> 22:10.515
She's been
transmitting

22:10.583 --> 22:12.818
false data
since this thing started.

22:12.885 --> 22:14.152
Naughty, naughty,
naughty hacker.

22:14.203 --> 22:15.320
If that is true,
understand,

22:15.388 --> 22:17.489
you are in a lot of trouble--
so who are you

22:17.540 --> 22:19.541
and who are you
working for?

22:20.793 --> 22:23.428
Hey. We're still dry.

22:23.496 --> 22:24.630
Yeah, sorry,

22:24.697 --> 22:25.831
it was a false alarm.

22:25.898 --> 22:27.132
Right after you hung up,

22:27.200 --> 22:28.433
the buoy's warning sensors
updated and pushed

22:28.501 --> 22:30.686
the wave's arrival time
back to 11:00 a.m.

22:30.770 --> 22:32.337
That's still not a lot of time
for you guys to get out

22:32.388 --> 22:33.472
of there, though.
It's okay;

22:33.523 --> 22:34.806
I don't believe
the tsunami's real.

22:34.874 --> 22:37.225
Russell wasn't on the boat,
but we found the source

22:37.310 --> 22:39.077
of the fake signal--
it's a hoax.

22:39.145 --> 22:41.847
A hoax? That's a hell
of a practical joke.

22:41.914 --> 22:43.181
How can you be sure?

22:43.232 --> 22:45.317
We can't be,
which is why right now

22:45.385 --> 22:46.485
we stick to the primary plan.

22:46.552 --> 22:49.621
Hey, do you remember

22:49.689 --> 22:51.189
what I told you
about coincidences?

22:51.240 --> 22:52.691
They take a lot of planning.

22:52.742 --> 22:55.026
The false alarm hit at 10:15.

22:55.078 --> 22:58.547
10:15, as in 1-0-1-5?

22:58.631 --> 23:01.032
That's Dr. Russell's
failed password.

23:01.084 --> 23:03.502
He knew-- and he
was trying to tip us off

23:03.553 --> 23:04.569
by manipulating the data.

23:04.637 --> 23:05.871
That's what I think, too.

23:05.938 --> 23:07.723
But what I don't get is,
why take Russell

23:07.807 --> 23:09.091
and then have
him fake a tsunami?

23:09.175 --> 23:10.375
To create a distraction.

23:10.426 --> 23:12.227
Any potential witnesses
have cleared out;

23:12.311 --> 23:14.396
the police are busy
with the evacuation.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.398
It's the perfect time
to pull off something big.

23:16.482 --> 23:18.884
You guys see if you can
figure out what they're after.

23:18.951 --> 23:20.952
We're gonna work
on trying to find Dr. Russell.

23:21.020 --> 23:22.721
Got it.

23:24.857 --> 23:26.858
This is what I'm gonna do.

23:26.926 --> 23:29.961
I'm gonna ask you,
uh, one more time,

23:30.029 --> 23:32.063
and then I am gonna
potentially get angry.

23:32.115 --> 23:35.066
So, please tell me--
where is Dr. Russell?

23:35.118 --> 23:38.570
Look, you're just
transmitting information, okay?

23:38.621 --> 23:41.239
Dr. Russell is sending it to you
from someplace else, isn't he?

23:41.307 --> 23:42.374
Against his will.

23:42.442 --> 23:45.343
Somebody's forcing
him to do this.

23:45.411 --> 23:48.947
This is the part where
you answer his question.

23:50.299 --> 23:51.383
Okay.

23:51.451 --> 23:53.051
You see?
You put us both

23:53.102 --> 23:55.187
in a bad position now-- he's
gonna go do something stupid.

23:57.306 --> 23:59.758
<i>Hey.</i>

23:59.826 --> 24:01.927
Any luck with the paint you
found outside Russell's place?

24:01.994 --> 24:03.028
Yeah, turns out
it's unique.

24:03.095 --> 24:05.147
Only issued
to government vehicles.

24:05.231 --> 24:06.765
Government?
I'm thinking maybe

24:06.816 --> 24:09.267
our abductors stole one so
they could hide in plain sight.

24:09.335 --> 24:10.952
Town's crawling with them.

24:11.037 --> 24:12.320
I just haven't heard back
from HPD.

24:12.405 --> 24:15.106
Yeah, well, I think they're
a little bit busy right now.

24:15.158 --> 24:17.309
What are all these?
Well, all government-issued vehicles,

24:17.376 --> 24:18.877
they're equipped with GPS.

24:18.944 --> 24:21.446
So these are the live locations
of all the evac trucks

24:21.514 --> 24:23.081
sent out by Department
of Emergency Management,

24:23.132 --> 24:24.499
the Coast Guard,
the National Guard.

24:24.584 --> 24:26.668
Any one of them could
have been at Russell's.

24:26.753 --> 24:28.320
Hard to get eyes on them all.
Yeah.

24:28.387 --> 24:30.622
How many of these are in
or around the evac zone?

24:30.673 --> 24:32.124
Twenty-four.

24:32.191 --> 24:34.509
All of them with the same
white paint we're looking for.

24:34.594 --> 24:37.128
McGarrett thinks all this is a
distraction from some bigger crime,

24:37.180 --> 24:40.198
so what we should do is narrow
down a list of high-value targets

24:40.266 --> 24:42.801
within the evacuation
zone-- consulates,

24:42.852 --> 24:45.303
locations of visiting
dignitaries, ambassadors...

24:45.354 --> 24:47.155
The bigger the distraction,
the bigger the target.

24:47.240 --> 24:48.306
Yeah.

24:51.778 --> 24:53.612
All right.

24:54.614 --> 24:56.748
Get some
answers here.

25:05.991 --> 25:07.392
Cute kid.

25:07.460 --> 25:09.628
Wow.

25:09.679 --> 25:11.329
Look at you.

25:11.380 --> 25:14.349
You're all cleaned up,
nice, combed, fancy.

25:14.433 --> 25:16.968
A little... side
part going on.

25:17.036 --> 25:19.838
Obviously, a
long time ago.

25:19.906 --> 25:21.223
That, uh,

25:21.307 --> 25:23.358
that's your little girl--
you don't see her

25:23.442 --> 25:25.443
that often,
do you?

25:25.511 --> 25:27.612
I think kids are the best.

25:27.680 --> 25:28.814
Best thing ever.

25:28.881 --> 25:30.982
The thing is about
them at that age

25:31.033 --> 25:32.884
is that they have
the worst memories.

25:32.952 --> 25:35.186
You know, my daughter, when
she was three years old,

25:35.238 --> 25:36.955
she hadn't seen her
uncle in, I don't know,

25:37.023 --> 25:38.123
five, six months,
and then he

25:38.190 --> 25:39.925
comes around, goes
to pick her up,

25:39.992 --> 25:41.793
and she goes bananas.

25:41.861 --> 25:45.096
I mean, she loses her mind, like she's
never seen the guy in her life.

25:45.164 --> 25:46.765
All right, starts
screaming bloody murder.

25:46.833 --> 25:48.049
I take her back.

25:48.134 --> 25:50.969
Anyway, they grow up fast,
is what I'm saying.

25:51.036 --> 25:53.204
You know what else?
When you get locked up

25:53.256 --> 25:54.873
for kidnapping
Dr. Russell, I mean,

25:54.941 --> 25:57.592
it could be five...
it could be ten years.

25:57.677 --> 25:59.227
before you see
her again.

25:59.312 --> 26:01.046
No, you can't do that!

26:01.113 --> 26:03.047
Okay.

26:03.099 --> 26:04.766
It speaks.

26:04.851 --> 26:06.952
Look, I don't know
any Dr. Russell, okay?

26:07.019 --> 26:08.687
Okay. So tell us
what you do know.

26:08.754 --> 26:12.107
Every eight minutes I get an e-mail
with new data from somewhere.

26:12.191 --> 26:14.326
And they're giving me 25K
to transmit it

26:14.393 --> 26:15.694
over the tsunami
warning frequency.

26:15.761 --> 26:17.279
Who is?
Who's paying you?

26:17.363 --> 26:18.830
I don't know.
It's all anonymous.

26:18.898 --> 26:20.165
They found me online.

26:20.233 --> 26:22.801
They sent me the money,
in cash, and a pager.

26:22.869 --> 26:25.003
The pager went off
this morning,

26:25.070 --> 26:26.755
so I started broadcasting.

26:26.839 --> 26:28.340
How long is this
supposed to go on for?

26:28.407 --> 26:30.108
I don't know, until noon?

26:30.176 --> 26:31.943
And then what?

26:32.011 --> 26:33.595
It's over, I guess.

26:33.679 --> 26:35.714
All right, I need to know
who's sending these e-mails.

26:35.781 --> 26:37.098
How am I supposed
to know that?

26:37.183 --> 26:39.351
You're a hacker. Hack.

26:39.418 --> 26:40.919
Come on.

26:58.070 --> 26:59.738
Howzit?

26:59.805 --> 27:01.539
Yo, Fridge, what's good?

27:01.607 --> 27:02.707
How's my baby girl?

27:02.775 --> 27:04.910
Oh, she's easy kine, brah.

27:04.961 --> 27:07.812
Right now my family's teaching
her about King Kamehameha

27:07.880 --> 27:10.332
and the unification
of the Hawaiian Islands.

27:10.416 --> 27:12.417
Okay. What... Hold on,
what is that sound?

27:12.485 --> 27:14.753
Please do me a favor--
don't do the part

27:14.804 --> 27:17.055
where the king throws
his enemies off the cliff.

27:17.122 --> 27:19.057
Ah, that's the best part.

27:19.124 --> 27:20.809
Could I just
speak to her, please?

27:20.893 --> 27:22.677
<i>Keiki, Danno for you.</i>

27:22.762 --> 27:24.963
Hello?

27:25.031 --> 27:26.314
Hey, baby. How you doing?

27:26.399 --> 27:27.966
Can I go home now?

27:28.017 --> 27:30.302
No, you got to hang in there a
little bit longer for me, okay?

27:30.369 --> 27:31.970
I'm gonna be there
just as soon as I can.

27:32.021 --> 27:32.971
Okay.

27:33.022 --> 27:34.072
I love you, monkey.

27:34.140 --> 27:36.574
Love you, too.

27:38.077 --> 27:40.662
Is there anything else
you want to do, Grace?

27:40.746 --> 27:42.747
Mmm... me and Daddy
like to play cards.

27:42.815 --> 27:45.717
Shootz, you're looking
at the king of Go Fish.

27:45.785 --> 27:48.586
How about five-card draw?

27:50.589 --> 27:52.424
Hey, everything okay?

27:52.491 --> 27:54.659
Is it okay?
Yeah, it's perfect.

27:54.710 --> 27:57.345
Daughter's spending the day
with an ex-criminal informant.

27:57.430 --> 27:59.214
Everything is just peachy.

27:59.298 --> 28:00.515
I blame you.

28:00.599 --> 28:02.334
Excuse me.
I blame you.

28:02.401 --> 28:03.501
How are we going
on a location?

28:03.552 --> 28:05.637
I have a floating I.P.
buried under layers

28:05.688 --> 28:06.705
of firewalls and encryption.

28:06.772 --> 28:08.173
Rome didn't burn in a day.

28:09.542 --> 28:11.192
I-I don't...
I'm pretty sure that's not...

28:13.612 --> 28:16.231
All right, is that him?
No, it's an e-mail from your friend.

28:16.315 --> 28:18.817
It's been eight minutes--
I have to refresh the data.

28:18.884 --> 28:20.318
Oh, no, don't bother--
just trace the e-mail

28:20.386 --> 28:21.619
and find out
where it's coming from.

28:21.687 --> 28:22.954
No, wait, we
need her to keep

28:23.022 --> 28:24.356
transmitting until noon
like she agreed.

28:24.423 --> 28:25.790
Otherwise, the kidnappers
are gonna know

28:25.858 --> 28:28.626
that their cover is blown and
Dr. Russell is as good as dead.

28:28.694 --> 28:31.029
Okay, so we'll just keep
thousands of people in the dark

28:31.080 --> 28:32.297
and maintain panic
in the streets.

28:32.364 --> 28:33.631
I like it.
The governor

28:33.699 --> 28:35.967
is not gonna cancel the alert
until we know for sure

28:36.035 --> 28:37.902
from Dr. Russell
that there is no real threat.

28:37.970 --> 28:39.904
Hah. Gotcha.

28:42.742 --> 28:44.743
There's our man.

29:04.425 --> 29:05.792
Chin, what do you got?

29:05.860 --> 29:07.828
The address checks out.

29:07.879 --> 29:10.196
It's an old storage warehouse
down on the docks.

29:10.248 --> 29:11.531
Okay, we're on the way.

29:11.582 --> 29:13.133
Hey, you got any hits
on the paint

29:13.201 --> 29:14.334
we collected
at the crime scene?

29:14.402 --> 29:16.436
I ran a list of potential
high-value targets

29:16.504 --> 29:17.821
within the evac zone

29:17.889 --> 29:20.040
and I crossed them
against GPS locations

29:20.107 --> 29:22.108
of the government vehicles
within the area, and only six

29:22.176 --> 29:24.711
of the targets have government
vehicles within a couple blocks.

29:24.762 --> 29:26.379
Okay, they only wanted
Tanya to keep up

29:26.447 --> 29:28.515
the signal until noon, which
means whatever's going down is

29:28.583 --> 29:31.518
going down right now. We don't have time
to cover all the targets and find Russell.

29:31.569 --> 29:34.104
Fine. Guys, grab the op gear,
meet us at the docks.

29:55.676 --> 29:57.010
All right...

29:57.077 --> 29:59.746
this is the place;
they came in here.

29:59.814 --> 30:01.815
It's bolted from
the inside.

30:01.883 --> 30:03.049
How do you want to get in?

30:03.100 --> 30:04.451
Right over there.
There's no sight lines.

30:40.120 --> 30:41.554
Just a few more hours,

30:41.622 --> 30:44.123
and you'll get to
see your daughter.

30:45.509 --> 30:47.727
I've got eyes on Dr. Russell.

30:54.669 --> 30:56.436
It's time for your
next transmission.

30:56.504 --> 30:58.271
Get to work.

31:04.445 --> 31:05.378
Stay put.

31:10.618 --> 31:12.168
Five-O! Drop
your weapon!

31:21.762 --> 31:25.198
You couldn't have
walked him down the steps?

31:25.266 --> 31:26.967
What's in his hand, Danny?

31:27.018 --> 31:29.035
He drew his gun on me, okay?

31:45.152 --> 31:46.820
You know,
this guy looks familiar.

31:46.871 --> 31:48.571
Well, if he's in the system,
we'll get a name.

31:49.857 --> 31:52.392
Got it.

31:52.460 --> 31:55.161
They said I needed to keep
sending new data until noon.

31:55.212 --> 31:57.864
If I didn't give them new
numbers every eight minutes,

31:57.915 --> 31:59.799
they were gonna
kill my daughter.

31:59.867 --> 32:03.303
She's okay. We had an officer take
her someplace safe. Thank you.

32:03.371 --> 32:05.305
All right, you said "they.
" I heard him on the phone.

32:05.373 --> 32:07.474
They needed a sector of
the city evacuated.

32:07.541 --> 32:08.875
Which sector?
Did you hear?

32:08.926 --> 32:10.760
No. But they needed me
to fabricate data

32:10.845 --> 32:12.912
that would force an
evacuation deep inland.

32:12.980 --> 32:14.381
Do you have any idea
what they were after?

32:14.448 --> 32:15.515
No.
Hey.

32:15.566 --> 32:17.350
Hey, I got a hit
on the print.

32:17.418 --> 32:18.902
All right, hey.

32:18.986 --> 32:21.421
Name is Harrison Dunphy.

32:21.489 --> 32:23.156
Dishonorably discharged
from the Coast Guard

32:23.223 --> 32:24.858
eight years ago due
to conduct unbecoming.

32:24.909 --> 32:26.860
Coast Guard?
Yeah.

32:26.911 --> 32:29.228
Kono, bring every Coast Guard
vehicle with white paint

32:29.280 --> 32:30.697
and get a live location, okay?

32:30.765 --> 32:32.248
We need to see if
these guys are in front

32:32.333 --> 32:34.134
of any of the potential targets.
Right, you got it.

32:34.201 --> 32:35.468
This guy, Dunphy,

32:35.536 --> 32:37.570
he ever serve
with the 14th District?

32:37.638 --> 32:39.406
Yeah. How'd you know that?
'Cause eight years ago,

32:39.473 --> 32:41.741
HPD worked a joint narco case
with the Guard.

32:41.792 --> 32:43.242
We raided a shipment
coming in off a freighter.

32:43.294 --> 32:45.412
Impounded 700 kilos of cocaine,

32:45.479 --> 32:48.247
along with millions of dollars
in cash.

32:48.299 --> 32:49.716
$28 million?

32:49.784 --> 32:52.752
$28 million that ended up in
the HPD asset-forfeiture locker.

32:52.803 --> 32:54.521
Which is right in the center
of the evacuation zone.

32:54.588 --> 32:56.356
Kono...
I'm already on it.

32:56.424 --> 32:58.124
Pulling up
the forfeiture locker.

32:58.192 --> 33:01.261
There's a white truck parked
out in front right now.

33:01.328 --> 33:04.497
That's it-- they're going for
what they think is $28 million.

33:04.565 --> 33:06.149
What they <i>think</i>
is $28 million.

33:06.233 --> 33:08.468
Not until you borrowed $10
million of it to save my life.

33:08.536 --> 33:09.636
We didn't have a choice.

33:09.703 --> 33:12.539
<i>Hesse was demanding</i>
<i>$10 million,</i>

33:12.606 --> 33:15.792
<i>or he was gonna kill you.</i>

33:15.876 --> 33:18.078
Well, $28 million, $18 million,
doesn't matter-- they're hitting

33:18.129 --> 33:19.412
the locker right now.
She's right.

33:19.480 --> 33:20.914
Hold on for one second.
Let's just think.

33:20.965 --> 33:21.981
Think about what
this means.

33:22.049 --> 33:23.449
Hey, I know what
this means, Danny.

33:23.501 --> 33:24.684
We go bust these guys,

33:24.752 --> 33:27.003
HPD does an inventory
on that money,

33:27.088 --> 33:29.389
they are gonna see that
$10 million is missing.

33:29.456 --> 33:31.791
It doesn't necessarily
trace back to us.

33:31.842 --> 33:34.627
We asked the governor to borrow $10
million, and she turned us down.

33:34.678 --> 33:37.130
As soon as the HPD tell her
exactly how much is missing,

33:37.181 --> 33:38.631
she's gonna put it
all together.

33:38.682 --> 33:39.766
Well, what's
the alternative?

33:39.817 --> 33:40.967
We could
let 'em go.

33:42.570 --> 33:44.470
Get a clean slate...

33:44.522 --> 33:45.839
and then I'd never

33:45.906 --> 33:47.574
look at my daughter
in the face again. Let's go.

33:47.641 --> 33:48.691
I'll drive.

34:13.607 --> 34:16.125
We're doing
the right thing.

34:16.478 --> 34:18.862
I know.

34:18.947 --> 34:20.864
We knew about the risks

34:20.949 --> 34:23.551
when we took the money.
I know.

34:28.456 --> 34:31.042
We should call HPD, get backup.

34:31.126 --> 34:33.745
That's an excellent idea--
just invite <i>more</i> cops

34:33.829 --> 34:35.663
to arrest us.

34:35.731 --> 34:38.498
Know what? I know what
you're thinking, all right?

34:38.567 --> 34:40.001
This is all my fault,
and that's fine.

34:40.052 --> 34:42.170
Listen to me, I was there, too,
my eyes were wide open,

34:42.237 --> 34:43.721
and I would do it again.

34:43.806 --> 34:45.139
It was worth it for Chin.

34:45.206 --> 34:47.391
But you have to admit
we've been crossing the line

34:47.476 --> 34:48.393
a little too
easily lately.

34:48.476 --> 34:49.594
All right?
And now it looks

34:49.678 --> 34:51.245
like we are going
to pay for it.

34:54.283 --> 34:55.600
HPD Command.

34:55.684 --> 34:56.818
Yeah, this is Five-O.

34:56.885 --> 34:58.653
We need assistance
at the main station.

34:58.720 --> 35:01.606
Five-O, be advised, closest
responding unit is ten away.

35:01.690 --> 35:02.957
What are you talking
about, ten away?

35:03.025 --> 35:04.125
You guys should be right there!

35:04.193 --> 35:05.777
All units are tied up
on evac line

35:05.861 --> 35:06.961
at Lunalilo Street.

35:07.029 --> 35:08.396
Who ordered them
that far back?

35:08.447 --> 35:10.164
Orders came down
from the Warning Center

35:10.232 --> 35:11.232
from Commander Hale.

35:11.300 --> 35:12.950
Hale? From the Coast Guard?

35:13.035 --> 35:15.336
Affirmative.

35:17.005 --> 35:18.756
Thank you, Dispatch.
It was him.

35:18.841 --> 35:21.092
He knew the warning system,
the evacuation protocol,

35:21.176 --> 35:22.794
and he had access to Russell.

35:22.878 --> 35:25.129
What do you think the odds are
that he was with the 14th when

35:25.214 --> 35:27.748
that bust went down?
Okay, he was playing us this morning,

35:27.800 --> 35:29.434
Captain America
out to protect the coastlines.

35:29.518 --> 35:30.935
I don't like being played.

35:31.019 --> 35:32.420
We need to call
the Coast Guard, tell them

35:32.471 --> 35:33.921
they're gonna take down
one of their own today.

35:45.167 --> 35:48.069
Hey, hands, hands, hands!
What the hell are you doing?

35:48.120 --> 35:51.139
We're supposed to be
getting out of the evac zone.
Shut up!

35:54.343 --> 35:55.460
Got a scratch,
right on the money.

35:55.544 --> 35:56.610
All right, hands
on the truck right now!

35:56.662 --> 35:59.380
Hands on the truck right now!

35:59.448 --> 36:01.616
Your buddy Dunphy tell you about
his hit-and-run this morning?

36:01.683 --> 36:04.051
What's going on here?
We have to clear this area right now.

36:04.119 --> 36:04.952
That's I've been telling them.

36:05.003 --> 36:06.421
Game's over, Hale.

36:06.472 --> 36:09.457
We know there's no tsunami,
and we know what you're after.

36:09.508 --> 36:11.359
This guy walks out
the front door of HPD

36:11.427 --> 36:13.060
with millions of dollars
in confiscated drug money.

36:13.128 --> 36:14.962
That's ridiculous! I have no
idea what you're talking about!

36:15.013 --> 36:17.515
Then you won't mind us taking a
look in the back of your truck.

36:17.599 --> 36:19.800
You're making a big mistake,
Commander McGarrett.

36:30.529 --> 36:32.313
Are we done here now?

36:32.364 --> 36:34.282
Because if it's
okay with you,

36:34.333 --> 36:37.001
I'd like to get back to my job
evacuating the city.

36:37.085 --> 36:39.454
After which I look forward
to having a nice, long chat

36:39.505 --> 36:41.456
with the governor
about this incident.

36:41.523 --> 36:42.924
Recognize this?

36:43.892 --> 36:45.893
We found one
just like it

36:45.961 --> 36:48.396
outside of Dr. Russell's house.

36:48.464 --> 36:50.348
It's a sandbag.
There are thousands everywhere.

36:50.432 --> 36:51.849
Yes, there are.

37:24.750 --> 37:27.034
That's smart.

37:27.085 --> 37:29.370
Wait till the disaster's
been averted,

37:29.421 --> 37:30.805
everybody's relieved,
the cleanup's underway,

37:30.872 --> 37:33.090
and then you come
back and you collect.

37:35.210 --> 37:38.079
Coast Guard tracked
that drug deal for six months.

37:38.146 --> 37:40.047
It was supposed to be
our takedown,

37:40.098 --> 37:42.116
but then HPD
swooped in,

37:42.184 --> 37:43.384
took the credit.

37:43.452 --> 37:45.386
Now I'm being
pushed out before my 20,

37:45.454 --> 37:47.421
no pension,
no benefits.

37:47.489 --> 37:49.557
My country owes me.

37:51.827 --> 37:55.763
Hey... let's clear
one thing up right now.

37:55.831 --> 37:57.999
You swore to support
and defend this country,

37:58.066 --> 37:59.500
no matter what the cost.

37:59.568 --> 38:01.769
She doesn't owe
you anything, okay?

38:04.907 --> 38:06.674
This, uh...

38:06.741 --> 38:10.278
could be our last chance
to say it. Go on.

38:15.183 --> 38:17.718
Book him, Danno.

38:20.556 --> 38:23.140
How much money is this?

38:25.694 --> 38:28.312
It's $28 million.

38:38.340 --> 38:40.875
♪ ♪

38:51.787 --> 38:54.055
♪ ♪

39:04.299 --> 39:05.766
Eh...!

39:06.902 --> 39:08.502
Lost again!

39:08.570 --> 39:09.704
Hey, babe.

39:11.506 --> 39:12.973
Daddy!

39:14.610 --> 39:16.744
What are you doing,
taking everybody's dough?

39:16.812 --> 39:18.112
Yeah? Good girl.

39:18.163 --> 39:20.498
Thank you, brother.

39:41.386 --> 39:44.238
What are you looking at?
We're all in this together.

39:47.209 --> 39:49.477
Lieutenant Commander,
she's ready for you.

39:49.528 --> 39:50.811
The governor

39:50.862 --> 39:51.862
only wants McGarrett.

40:13.168 --> 40:15.386
Hey.

40:17.806 --> 40:19.674
Listen, whatever
happens, none of us

40:19.725 --> 40:22.443
would've done anything
any different, all right?

40:23.712 --> 40:25.513
Yeah.

40:43.665 --> 40:46.000
She wanted to thank us.

40:46.068 --> 40:47.901
Actually,
she wanted to, uh,

40:47.953 --> 40:51.906
to congratulate us
on another job well done.

40:53.308 --> 40:55.242
I'm-I'm sorry, what?

40:55.310 --> 40:57.178
All right, what about the money?

40:57.245 --> 40:58.479
$28 million.

40:59.581 --> 41:02.550
It's all present
and accounted for.

41:05.387 --> 41:06.620
Hmm.

41:06.688 --> 41:08.389
Wh-Whoa. I don't understand.

41:09.424 --> 41:13.160
The money's all there.
