broke out, like,

04:13.000 --> 04:15.103

in the yard.

04:23.103 --> 04:24.896

04:24.965 --> 04:27.758
But then I remember we have
the obedience course tomorrow,

04:27.827 --> 04:31.655
and so maybe he just needs
a little bit more trainin',

04:31.724 --> 04:33.793
and we just need
to establish some ground rules

04:33.862 --> 04:35.655

04:36.862 --> 04:39.793
-
God!

04:39.862 --> 04:41.793
<i>- You know,
we're all going through stuff,</i>

04:41.862 --> 04:44.000
but, like, I think we all
just need to understand

04:44.068 --> 04:46.137
that hey, sometimes
someone's going through it

04:46.206 --> 04:48.000
more than somebody else,
so we need to rally around

04:48.068 --> 04:50.379
each other whenever someone
is going through something.

04:50.448 --> 04:52.344
- If I could've ran
as fast as Gus,

04:52.413 --> 04:53.931
I would've been gone, bitches.

04:56.344 --> 04:59.586
Instead I got the pregnant girl

05:02.827 --> 05:04.482
<i>I think what makes me

05:04.551 --> 05:06.137
<i>is just

05:08.103 --> 05:10.137

05:10.206 --> 05:12.310

05:12.379 --> 05:13.620
- Aimee, I'm gonna go
use the bathroom really quick.

05:13.689 --> 05:15.724
- No, you're fine, Nilsa.
You did enough.

05:15.793 --> 05:18.655

- Don't feel bad.

05:18.724 --> 05:21.310
<i>Aimee's staying,

05:21.379 --> 05:22.896
Thank God.
Because if Aimee goes,

05:22.965 --> 05:24.655
I gotta go,
and I really don't want

05:24.724 --> 05:25.931
to have
to start packing my stuff.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.551
This is training

05:28.620 --> 05:30.896

- Love you too.

05:30.965 --> 05:32.103
- Should we go inside and,
like, try

05:32.172 --> 05:33.689
to sniff out what happened?
- You can.

05:33.758 --> 05:35.241
- I kind of want to,
just 'cause I want to know

05:35.310 --> 05:36.379

she's even made for.

05:36.448 --> 05:37.689
- Want to?
- Yeah, I don't even know

05:37.758 --> 05:38.793
what she's mad for.
- All right, let's go.

05:38.862 --> 05:40.241
<i>- When I was going through it</i>

05:40.310 --> 05:41.689

always in my head spiraling,

05:41.758 --> 05:42.965

<i>So, like, if I can make sure</i>

05:44.275 --> 05:46.344

05:46.413 --> 05:47.379

But I think everything's okay.

05:56.586 --> 05:58.448

05:58.517 --> 05:59.758

05:59.827 --> 06:01.551

06:22.758 --> 06:24.310
We were outside

06:24.379 --> 06:25.724
like, kind of just
doing our own thing.

06:25.793 --> 06:27.551
I didn't even realize, like,
something had popped off

06:27.620 --> 06:29.344
where you were, like,
losin' your like that.

06:29.413 --> 06:31.758
- No, I'm just, like, it's--
I think it was just, like,

06:31.827 --> 06:34.793
a lot of on top
of, like, one or the other.

06:34.862 --> 06:36.827
- A lot of just, like,
as in back home stuff?

06:36.896 --> 06:40.068
- Yeah, like,
one of the things are, like,

06:40.137 --> 06:41.793
you know, Dillon.

06:41.862 --> 06:43.655
I think
that Dillon is a great guy,

06:43.724 --> 06:46.310
but we all know
what disease he struggles with.

06:46.379 --> 06:47.931

- That--

06:48.000 --> 06:51.068
God, it about--

06:51.137 --> 06:52.344
It breaks me.

06:52.413 --> 06:54.275
You know
I'm not the type of person

06:54.344 --> 06:55.379
to, like, give up on people.

06:55.448 --> 06:56.620
- Yeah.
- I don't--

06:56.689 --> 06:58.724
I don't think that
he knows how much, like,

06:58.793 --> 07:01.758
his own addiction has, like,
a struggle on my own life.

07:01.827 --> 07:03.586
- No, he doesn't.
But that's not your fault.

07:03.655 --> 07:05.068
Like, I love Dillon.
You know I love Dillon.

07:05.137 --> 07:07.275

- We get along great.

07:07.344 --> 07:08.655
Like, I love that kid.
- We all love Dillon.

07:08.724 --> 07:10.206
He's a great man.

07:10.275 --> 07:12.517
I want you to be, like,
mentally, like, healthy.

07:12.586 --> 07:14.137

07:17.517 --> 07:19.655

like, here, it's me.

07:19.724 --> 07:21.517

07:29.241 --> 07:30.689
You're strong enough
to handle it.

07:30.758 --> 07:32.586

I am good.

07:32.655 --> 07:36.172

07:54.724 --> 07:56.172
- What's up?

07:57.931 --> 07:59.482

for a phone call?

07:59.551 --> 08:01.655
- Mm-mm.
I don't care.

08:01.724 --> 08:03.241
<i>- I see
Aimee pick up the phone,</i>

08:03.310 --> 08:05.758
<i>and I'm like,
oh, my God, here we go.</i>

08:05.827 --> 08:07.724
She's not the person
to give up on anyone

08:07.793 --> 08:09.758
or leave anyone high and dry.

08:09.827 --> 08:13.655
But I also want her
to have respect for herself.

08:13.724 --> 08:16.413
Like, you have to be able
to set those boundaries.

08:34.413 --> 08:36.034
<i>I'm panicking.
Pick up the phone.</i>

08:36.103 --> 08:38.000
I just want him to be okay.

08:43.413 --> 08:45.206
- What kind of commands
do they know?

08:45.275 --> 08:46.551
- Mine knows "eat."

08:46.620 --> 08:49.068
- And don't say "bacon"
or "sausage" around him,

08:49.137 --> 08:50.344
'cause he gets offended.

08:50.413 --> 08:51.586
- Okay.

08:51.655 --> 08:53.000
- All I gotta do
is put my mouth around it?

08:53.068 --> 08:54.344
- You have to put, like--
I mean, like,

08:54.413 --> 08:56.103
I'm talkin'
lips wrapped around, like...

08:56.172 --> 08:58.137
I swear to God,

08:58.206 --> 09:01.448
if you do that,
I will give you 500 bucks.

09:01.517 --> 09:03.206
All the way down.

09:10.103 --> 09:11.551
<i>- Pick up the phone, Dillon.

09:11.620 --> 09:13.034

09:14.413 --> 09:16.758
<i>- Hello?

09:16.827 --> 09:19.551
<i>- Hi.
- Are you okay?</i>

09:19.620 --> 09:21.620
<i>- Yeah.</i>

09:21.689 --> 09:24.103
- I have been
going through it.

09:24.172 --> 09:27.241
I, like, literally just
had a mental breakdown

09:27.310 --> 09:29.379
and [bleep],
like, tried to run away.

09:30.379 --> 09:33.379
- Because I'm just sad about
everything that's happened.

09:33.448 --> 09:35.620
Like, so many things
have to change.

09:35.689 --> 09:39.758
I just can't keep doin' this.
I am, like, struggling so bad.

09:41.655 --> 09:43.206
So bad.

09:51.620 --> 09:53.758
- Giving her a hug right now
I feel like is what she needs.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.793
And so I'll hug her as long
as she needs to be hugged.

09:55.862 --> 09:59.724
- It's just so hard
to be away from your life

09:59.793 --> 10:02.793
when you're up,
you know?

10:02.862 --> 10:07.827
<i>- ♪ Baby, one more time,

10:07.896 --> 10:11.655

Dillon is having some issues.

10:11.724 --> 10:15.620
<i>And so I always tell Aimee
be there for him as a friend,</i>

10:15.689 --> 10:19.000

10:21.344 --> 10:25.448
that you have to be sober
to get this love that you want.

10:25.517 --> 10:27.413
- I've been, like,
having problems sleeping

10:27.482 --> 10:28.689
and, like, eating and

10:32.275 --> 10:33.862
Just wanted to know
you were okay, though.

10:33.931 --> 10:35.137
That's why I called.

10:35.206 --> 10:36.482
<i>- I been okay.</i>

10:42.793 --> 10:45.000

10:46.068 --> 10:47.034

10:51.103 --> 10:54.000

a group prayer, please?

11:02.103 --> 11:03.275
- Yeah.
- Can I pray for you?

11:03.344 --> 11:05.689
- I need prayer.
Well, I think we all do.

11:05.758 --> 11:08.103
- Everybody,
let's do a group prayer.

11:08.172 --> 11:10.586
Dear heavenly Father,
I just wanna ask

11:10.655 --> 11:12.137
that you uplift Aimee
right now.

11:12.206 --> 11:14.172
<i>- Even though some

<i>I love my roommates.</i>

<i>- ♪ I guess there's nothing

11:20.482 --> 11:22.620
- I wanna ask that you put your

11:22.689 --> 11:25.379
Give him the strength that
he needs to get all the help

11:25.448 --> 11:27.448
that he needs, Lord God,
and that you give Aimee

11:27.517 --> 11:29.310
the strength to stay strong,
Lord God.

11:29.379 --> 11:31.482
<i>- I guess what I'm just
trying to say is,</i>

11:31.551 --> 11:34.379
<i>holding onto things
and running away from them</i>

11:34.448 --> 11:35.827
<i>wasn't the answer.</i>

11:35.896 --> 11:37.724
Amen.

11:37.793 --> 11:39.275
- I love you.
- I love you.

11:41.758 --> 11:43.344
<i>- Do I wanna
go into the bathtub</i>

11:43.413 --> 11:44.862
and cry it out and go to sleep,

11:44.931 --> 11:46.448
or do I wanna party?

11:46.517 --> 11:48.551
- We're partying, baby,
that's what!

11:48.620 --> 11:52.068
- We're a crazy, dysfunctional
family, obviously.

11:52.137 --> 11:55.034
We go through stuff in
the house, outside the house,

11:55.103 --> 11:57.241
but ultimately,
and at the end of the day,

11:57.310 --> 12:00.034
we come together and we unite
and we love each other,

12:00.103 --> 12:01.482
because we're a family.

12:01.551 --> 12:04.068
And that's all that matters.

12:04.137 --> 12:06.310
- Yeah,
I wanna go to the firepit.

12:06.379 --> 12:08.310
- Do you wanna take a bath?
- Come on, buddy.

12:08.379 --> 12:10.586
<i>- Jeremiah and I are gonna
give Ravioli a bath,</i>

12:10.655 --> 12:14.620
because we found a trainer
to take in Ravioli and PGP

12:14.689 --> 12:17.310
<i>for obedience training
tomorrow.</i>

12:17.379 --> 12:19.034
Okay.
- Come here, buddy.

12:19.103 --> 12:20.758
- You know, like,
your kid's first day of school,

12:20.827 --> 12:22.448
you bathe 'em before,
you put a bow in their hair,

12:22.517 --> 12:24.965
you kind of, like, doctor 'em
all up and make 'em look

12:25.034 --> 12:27.655
like an angel even though
they're kind of the devil?

12:27.724 --> 12:29.000
That's what we're doin'
with Ravioli.

12:29.068 --> 12:30.448
- Are you gonna
get the butthole area?

12:30.517 --> 12:32.827
- Yeah, unfortunately,
I'm gonna have to.

12:32.896 --> 12:35.655
Ah!

12:35.724 --> 12:38.310
That boy is so easy to clean.

12:39.413 --> 12:41.896
- All done, Jeremiah.

12:41.965 --> 12:43.827
Aww.

12:43.896 --> 12:45.793
- Hey, buddy.
I love it!

12:45.862 --> 12:47.517
There's a dog comin'
out of my butt.

12:48.862 --> 12:50.103
<i>- So embarrassing, dude.</i>

12:50.172 --> 12:52.620
I won't do it again.
- We all have blowups.

12:52.689 --> 12:55.931
- Or at least I hope I won't.
-

12:56.000 --> 12:57.482
- Huh, never say never.

12:57.551 --> 13:00.655
- I--
you better knock on some wood.

13:00.724 --> 13:02.068
Mm, that's close enough.

13:02.137 --> 13:04.724
- Did I hit a midlife crisis?

13:04.793 --> 13:08.103
- No, you just hit that--
that quarterlife crisis.

13:08.172 --> 13:09.827
- Crisis.
Oh, God, I got one more to go.

13:10.965 --> 13:12.310
I actually feel a lot better

13:12.379 --> 13:14.793
after I had
my little meltdown.

13:14.862 --> 13:16.655
<i>It felt good
to get a hold of Dillon.</i>

13:16.724 --> 13:18.896
<i>Like,
I'm so happy that he's okay,</i>

13:18.965 --> 13:21.896
but I've did that
a lot of times now.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.448
<i>- You ain't talked
to him all day?</i>

13:25.517 --> 13:27.034
- No. <i>
- Hm.</i>

13:27.103 --> 13:29.000
<i>- Your call has
been forwarded to an--</i>

13:29.068 --> 13:30.379
- The last time I heard
from him he said

13:30.448 --> 13:31.965
he was

13:32.034 --> 13:33.965
<i>- And yeah, he don't need
to be with that neither.</i>

13:34.034 --> 13:36.103
- Why, 'cause he's a drughead? <i>
- Yeah.</i>

13:36.172 --> 13:37.862
- And I'm tired.

13:37.931 --> 13:40.137
I'm tired of putting myself
through that.

13:40.206 --> 13:41.724
You know how I am.
- Yeah, I know.

13:41.793 --> 13:44.620
- I try to be bad,
try to hold in,

13:44.689 --> 13:47.000
until it just explodes
off the handle.

13:47.068 --> 13:50.000
- Yeah.
- And I hate that about me.

13:50.068 --> 13:51.448
- We get it, though; we get it.

13:51.517 --> 13:52.931
- I do that same

13:53.000 --> 13:54.586
- That
is so embarrassing.

13:54.655 --> 13:55.965
Like, oh, why do I act
like that?

13:56.034 --> 13:57.241
- it.

13:57.310 --> 14:00.586
- I feel like I've evolved
in some ways.

14:00.655 --> 14:04.206
But I feel like I'm growing and
I can't figure out who I am.

14:04.275 --> 14:07.034
- Everybody goes through those,
those parts.

14:07.103 --> 14:08.793
You'll figure it out.
You'll get it.

14:08.862 --> 14:10.413
<i>Aimee's, like,
one of my best friends.</i>

14:10.482 --> 14:12.758
<i>I love Dillon too,
but what's the saying,</i>

14:12.827 --> 14:14.413
<i>like,
if you really love someone,</i>

14:14.482 --> 14:16.275
sometimes you have to let them go?

14:16.344 --> 14:20.172
<i>If it's not beneficial
to her and her well-being</i>

14:20.241 --> 14:22.344
<i>and the progress and
the growth that she's making,</i>

14:22.413 --> 14:23.758
you gotta cut him loose.

14:23.827 --> 14:24.965
- Love you.
Good night.

14:25.034 --> 14:26.793
- All right, love you too.

14:26.862 --> 14:28.448
Ow.
- Knucklehead.

14:28.517 --> 14:30.586
- Yay!
- Clean boy!

14:30.655 --> 14:33.655
Clean boy!
Clean boy, yeah!

14:33.724 --> 14:34.931
- You're so clean!

14:35.000 --> 14:37.103
Thank you, Jeremiah.
- Of course.

14:37.172 --> 14:41.758
Here goes nothing.
PGP, it's bath time.

14:41.827 --> 14:45.689
I gave Ravioli a bath,
so I feel like I'm inclined

14:45.758 --> 14:47.310
to give the pig a bath as well.

14:47.379 --> 14:48.931
Get back.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.275
Ravioli!
Go on!

14:51.344 --> 14:53.758
I'm not trying to hurt you.

14:53.827 --> 14:56.896
I'm just trying to clean you.
I swear!

14:56.965 --> 14:58.241
- Ravioli!

14:58.310 --> 15:01.000
- Get back.
Ravioli, go!

15:01.068 --> 15:03.655
Go!
- Ravioli Pepperoni Ganza,

15:03.724 --> 15:05.931
get over here!

15:06.000 --> 15:10.137
- There is a little differences
between washing Nilsa's dog

15:10.206 --> 15:11.344

15:15.034 --> 15:18.517
Everybody poops, everybody
poops, everybody poops.

15:24.310 --> 15:27.379
Hoo!

15:29.931 --> 15:34.000
Egh!

15:34.068 --> 15:37.724
I will literally wash dogs
for the rest of my life

15:37.793 --> 15:43.448
as long as I never have
to wash PGP ever again.

15:45.344 --> 15:47.241
Do you think I'm enjoying this?

15:52.413 --> 15:54.620
- Come here, buddy.
- Go, PGP!

15:54.689 --> 15:55.896
- I love this pig, man.

15:55.965 --> 15:58.827
- Ravioli,
take some frickin' notes.

15:58.896 --> 16:01.275
- I swear to God,
if you do that,

16:01.344 --> 16:03.310
I will give you 500 bucks.

17:29.103 --> 17:31.517
Jeremiah just gave him a bath.

17:31.586 --> 17:33.000

17:33.068 --> 17:34.275

17:34.344 --> 17:35.724

- Codi, do it.

17:35.793 --> 17:38.000

PGP needs obedience school

17:47.896 --> 17:51.103
Oh!

18:26.000 --> 18:27.931

of insanity.

I'm about to hit a shot.</i>

18:29.793 --> 18:31.034

18:31.103 --> 18:33.586
Bye. <i>

18:33.655 --> 18:35.000
- I'm seven months pregnant,

18:35.068 --> 18:36.724

to obedience school.

18:36.793 --> 18:39.931
This is gonna be so fun.

18:43.862 --> 18:45.137

<i>It's Jeremiah!

18:58.310 --> 19:00.172
<i>- I hate the fact that
the timing of our vacation</i>

19:00.241 --> 19:01.793
made me miss you guys.

19:01.862 --> 19:04.620
<i>- I know.
And of course tomorrow</i>

19:04.689 --> 19:07.413

19:18.862 --> 19:20.724
<i>and to be honest,
I forgot about it.</i>

19:22.655 --> 19:24.862
- Yeah, for the most part.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.103
<i>- All right, love you.
Have fun.</i>

19:26.172 --> 19:27.379

19:27.448 --> 19:29.068
<i>- Okay, bye.</i>

19:29.137 --> 19:31.137

19:33.931 --> 19:35.620
It's Jeremiah's birthday
tomorrow, y'all.

19:35.689 --> 19:36.896

19:36.965 --> 19:38.172

19:38.241 --> 19:39.620

19:39.689 --> 19:42.206
We'll have balloons out here,
pizza, little games.

Pin the tail on the donkey!
Gus, what do you think?

19:44.724 --> 19:46.758
- Jeremiah and I's birthday
are very close.

19:46.827 --> 19:48.310
They're, like, four days apart,
and in the past,

19:48.379 --> 19:49.586
we have celebrated them
together.

19:49.655 --> 19:53.103
- Surprise, mother

19:54.724 --> 19:56.724

Oh, my God, dude.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.344
It's my birthday, guys,
please, can we just leave?

20:06.413 --> 20:07.931

20:20.275 --> 20:21.620
- October 1st.

20:21.689 --> 20:22.931

Okay, I'm--

20:54.413 --> 20:55.379
- Oh, God.

20:55.448 --> 20:57.413
- My belly's big, I'm short.

20:57.482 --> 21:00.103
I can't reach up to the mirror

21:00.172 --> 21:01.620

21:01.689 --> 21:02.758
I can't.

21:02.827 --> 21:04.689
So I got myself a vanity.

21:04.758 --> 21:06.413
- Oh, we got some drawers.

21:06.482 --> 21:08.034
- I feel really good

21:08.103 --> 21:12.000
Um, I gotta get Ravioli ready

21:12.068 --> 21:13.655
- Oh, so I'm doing it
by myself.

21:13.724 --> 21:15.551
- So I'll be back later.

21:15.620 --> 21:17.379
Jeremiah's one of those guys

21:21.586 --> 21:23.275

- All right.

21:25.448 --> 21:27.000
Come on.

21:27.068 --> 21:28.275
- Will you help me
put this on him?

21:28.344 --> 21:30.517
- Aww.
Come here, PGP!

21:30.586 --> 21:33.413
- Here.

21:33.482 --> 21:35.896
Oh, my God.
Look, he looks so cute.

21:35.965 --> 21:37.896
Oh!
You know what we should do,

21:37.965 --> 21:39.827
we should take
some lil' school photos!

21:39.896 --> 21:42.344
Like, first day of school
photos with him.

21:42.413 --> 21:44.931

my baby a board</i>

21:47.551 --> 21:49.310

21:49.379 --> 21:52.103
- All right,
so we're making signs

21:52.172 --> 21:54.586

of school.

21:54.655 --> 21:57.931

for his first day of school.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.379

um--

22:00.448 --> 22:01.793
- His favorite snack.

22:01.862 --> 22:03.931
We know what
Ravi's favorite snack is.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.448
- I'm not gonna write that
on mine.

22:07.413 --> 22:10.206
Uh, weight is 23 pounds.

22:10.275 --> 22:12.137
His favorite human is Mommy.

22:12.206 --> 22:16.517
His favorite hobby is humping.

22:16.586 --> 22:18.896
And when he grows up,
he wants to be a drag queen.

22:18.965 --> 22:21.000

of this?

22:24.206 --> 22:25.965

34:40.206 --> 34:41.931
I don't think there's enough
money in the world.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.034
<i>- ♪ I gotta get this
money though, money though ♪</i>

34:45.103 --> 34:47.724
- Kirk, I swear to God,
if you do that,

34:47.793 --> 34:50.482
I will give you 500 bucks.

34:50.551 --> 34:53.172
- Bro, there's no way in hell
he would ever do that.

34:53.241 --> 34:55.620
- I will--I will pay you
right the now.

34:55.689 --> 34:58.517
- Here's the thing,
I like money.

34:58.586 --> 34:59.827
And if you're gonna
bet me something

34:59.896 --> 35:02.275
that ain't gon' kill me,
I'm probably gonna do it.

35:02.344 --> 35:04.275
$500?
- $500.

35:04.344 --> 35:06.103
- You wanna see it,
and then go from there?

35:06.172 --> 35:09.931
- I gotta see it.
- Okay, well, see it then.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.206
Hey,
take the bandage off, though.

35:12.275 --> 35:14.241
- Anytime us boys get together
and start drinkin',

35:14.310 --> 35:16.172
we start makin'
some really stupid bets,

35:16.241 --> 35:17.758
but this one might
take the cake.

35:17.827 --> 35:19.379
- The whole toe.

35:19.448 --> 35:21.241
All the way down to the quick,

35:21.310 --> 35:22.655
- Ow, [bleep]!

35:22.724 --> 35:25.827
<i>Somehow or another,
Codi bets Kirk $500</i>

35:25.896 --> 35:27.793
to wrap his mouth
around my toe.

35:27.862 --> 35:29.551
- All I gotta do
is put my mouth around it?

35:29.620 --> 35:31.275
- You have to put, like--
I mean, like, I'm talkin'

35:31.344 --> 35:33.586
lips wrapped around, like--

35:33.655 --> 35:35.620
<i>- Looking at the boot
that this toe is in,</i>

35:35.689 --> 35:38.310
it's got, like, brown mud
all the way around it

35:38.379 --> 35:40.275
like he stepped in a lake
with it or something,

35:40.344 --> 35:41.586
and I'm just like,

35:41.655 --> 35:43.758
nah, it's gonna take
a lot more for me.

35:43.827 --> 35:45.655
- You want that?
- Oh, God.

35:45.724 --> 35:48.862
- In your mouth.
$500.

35:48.931 --> 35:51.137
- Puttin' a toe in my mouth

35:51.206 --> 35:54.034
when I don't have
to touch it as much for $500?

35:54.103 --> 35:56.413
- Gus has grocery store feet.
It's been in that boot

35:56.482 --> 35:58.413
for a hot minute,
and there is no telling

35:58.482 --> 35:59.758
when he last washed that thing.

35:59.827 --> 36:01.551
- YOLO.
Hashtag YOLO.

36:01.620 --> 36:02.586
You only live once.

36:02.655 --> 36:04.965
- Where you at, bro?

36:05.034 --> 36:06.896
Send the money already, baby.

36:06.965 --> 36:08.758
- That son of a bitch ain't
showered in three days.

36:08.827 --> 36:09.896
- Four.
- Four.

36:09.965 --> 36:12.275
- 500, put my mouth on a toe.

36:12.344 --> 36:14.103
Oh, all right.
You lost that money.

36:14.172 --> 36:17.068
- I am a man of my word.
I will Venmo you the $500

36:17.137 --> 36:19.655
right the now.

36:19.724 --> 36:23.241
$500.

36:23.310 --> 36:25.896
<i>- Is $500 worth it?</i>

36:25.965 --> 36:28.310
Yeah.

36:28.379 --> 36:30.965
- Yo, God damn it!

36:31.034 --> 36:32.448
- Hey, I got this.
Come on.

36:32.517 --> 36:34.103
Put it right here.

36:34.172 --> 36:36.103
- In your mouth.
All the way down.

36:36.172 --> 36:38.862
- Ew!

36:43.344 --> 36:44.275
<i>- Rip it off.
You gotta put</i>

36:44.344 --> 36:45.482
<i>the whole toe in your mouth.</i>

36:45.551 --> 36:48.172
- The whole toe.

36:48.241 --> 36:50.137
- All right, come on.
Put it right here.

36:50.206 --> 36:52.862
- I'm honestly embarrassed
how ugly it looks.

36:52.931 --> 36:54.517
- All the way down.

36:54.586 --> 36:56.551
All the way down.
- [bleep], Kirk.

36:56.620 --> 36:58.862
They're both broke.
- All the way down.

36:58.931 --> 37:01.068
- Like, I'm all for the game.
Like, if you wanna suck my toe,

37:01.137 --> 37:03.310
big dog, come on,
it's ready for a suckin'.

37:04.689 --> 37:08.275
- Just think,
you can buy another grill.

37:08.344 --> 37:11.000
- Ew, God damn it!

37:11.068 --> 37:12.344
- Oh, my God.
- No!

37:12.413 --> 37:13.344
No you--
No.

37:13.413 --> 37:14.655
No, he didn't do it.

37:14.724 --> 37:16.034
Hey, you know,
when you do this,

37:16.103 --> 37:17.689
you gotta put your lips
around this

37:17.758 --> 37:19.103
There ain't no cheatin'
or whatever.

37:19.172 --> 37:20.689
- Did I not--
oh, clamp?

37:20.758 --> 37:21.896
- Yeah, yeah.
You didn't do it right--

37:21.965 --> 37:23.620
- Lick it.
Put your tongue on it.

37:23.689 --> 37:25.068
Stick your tongue out.

37:25.137 --> 37:26.379
- Ew!

37:27.724 --> 37:29.896
- Ugh, God.
- Boom.

37:29.965 --> 37:32.482
- That was worth
every penny I spent.

37:32.551 --> 37:33.655
Worth it all.

37:35.689 --> 37:37.517
- Oh, I wouldn't have
done it at all.

37:37.586 --> 37:38.965
I ain't stupid.

37:39.034 --> 37:40.206
- I didn't even touch the toe.

37:40.275 --> 37:41.793
You lost money,
you stupid bitch.

37:41.862 --> 37:43.448
- Well, then it--
you didn't do it right then.

37:43.517 --> 37:44.931
- You saw it.
You knew what I was doin'.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.448
- Then you didn't do it then.
- No, I did it though!

37:46.517 --> 37:47.620
He knows it.
- I told you

37:47.689 --> 37:48.793
what you had to do.

37:48.862 --> 37:50.068
- Nah, did I not--
was that not--

37:50.137 --> 37:51.655
- He wrapped his lips
around it.

37:51.724 --> 37:52.689
<i>- There's not enough money
in the world</i>

37:52.758 --> 37:54.379
<i>for me to suck Gus' toe.</i>

37:54.448 --> 37:57.862
Like...

37:57.931 --> 37:58.862
no.

37:58.931 --> 38:00.034
- that.
If I--

38:00.103 --> 38:02.172
Look at this thing!
- That's $500!

38:02.241 --> 38:03.413
- I'm a man of my word.

38:03.482 --> 38:06.068
I will Venmo you the $500,

38:06.137 --> 38:09.241
and I will show you
the receipt.

38:09.310 --> 38:12.793
<i>- The easiest $500 I ever made
in my life.</i>

38:12.862 --> 38:14.931
Suckin' toes--
- Suckin' toes.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.103
What does that say, Gus?

38:18.448 --> 38:20.206
- God damn, son.

38:20.275 --> 38:23.034
- Did you even feel it?

38:23.103 --> 38:24.517
Stupid!

38:24.586 --> 38:26.827
That was weird, though.
- Yeah, very weird.

38:26.896 --> 38:29.137
- Well done, Kirk.
Well done.

38:29.206 --> 38:31.137
- Aye, that was the easiest
five I ever made

38:31.206 --> 38:32.551
in my life.

38:32.620 --> 38:34.827
- You put a broke man's toe
in your mouth.

38:34.896 --> 38:36.517
- You don't understand;
I really didn't touch

38:36.586 --> 38:37.655
any of his toe.

38:37.724 --> 38:39.034
That's the craziest part
about it.

38:39.103 --> 38:41.758
<i>- Listen, Kirk,
you tryin' to explain</i>

38:41.827 --> 38:44.517
to me that you didn't
suck another man's toe?

38:44.586 --> 38:45.793
- Did you feel it?
- Nope.

38:45.862 --> 38:47.310
- Exactly, so did I actually--

38:47.379 --> 38:49.137
- But you still did it, though.
That's the fact.

38:49.206 --> 38:52.103
I mean, you could act like
you weren't, but...

38:52.172 --> 38:54.689
you still sucked
that toe.

38:54.758 --> 38:55.862
Let me see that grill again.

38:55.931 --> 38:57.724
Is that toe jam
in that [bleep]?

38:59.517 --> 39:01.137
- Is that foot breath I smell?

39:01.206 --> 39:02.482
I've gotta get away from you,
man.

39:02.551 --> 39:03.862
Damn.

39:03.931 --> 39:05.689
His toe was broke.

39:05.758 --> 39:07.862
He can't feel
- Gus.

39:07.931 --> 39:08.931
- So he don't know.
- I just said it [bleep]!

39:09.000 --> 39:10.137
- He don't know.

39:10.206 --> 39:12.758
I make $500 a weekend
suckin' toes.

39:14.034 --> 39:17.000
But they gotta
be broke and infected.

39:17.068 --> 39:18.689
- All right, like,
it's all fun and games.

39:18.758 --> 39:21.000
It's funny and [bleep], but now
you're actually making me mad.

39:21.068 --> 39:23.586
- Codi, behave.

39:23.655 --> 39:25.034
Say you're sorry.

39:25.103 --> 39:28.137
- Oh, I'm sorry I paid him $500

39:28.206 --> 39:31.000
to put his broke toe
in his mouth.

39:31.068 --> 39:32.310
Oh, I'm sorry.

39:32.379 --> 39:35.965
Excuse me.
Let me apologize.

39:37.241 --> 39:39.344
- You sucked his toe,
Like, it's fine.

39:39.413 --> 39:41.310
You're, like, a toe-sucker.
It's okay.

39:41.379 --> 39:42.862
<i>No one is judging you.</i>

39:42.931 --> 39:45.413
- You got paid, Kirk.
It's okay.

39:45.482 --> 39:46.586
- It's fine!

39:46.655 --> 39:49.931
You got paid
to suck his broke toe.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.275
It's fine.
- Thank you, thank you.

39:51.344 --> 39:52.586
Thank you, thank you.
- God damn!

39:52.655 --> 39:54.689
- Hey, I appreciate that.

39:54.758 --> 39:57.793
- Yeah, you're welcome.

39:57.862 --> 39:59.931
-
Damn.

40:01.793 --> 40:04.344
- Well,
we got two birthdays this week.

40:04.413 --> 40:05.896
- Yay!

40:05.965 --> 40:08.793
Can I get my toe sucked
as a present?

40:08.862 --> 40:10.241
No? Too early?

40:10.310 --> 40:11.241
- I will you up;
how 'bout that?

40:11.310 --> 40:12.517
- Oh, my God.

40:12.586 --> 40:13.896
- You think I'm scared of you,
[bleep]?

40:13.965 --> 40:15.310
- I know you're not, but--

40:15.379 --> 40:17.241
- You can try if you want.
- Stand up then, dude.

40:17.310 --> 40:19.241
<i>- It's so easy
to rile Kirk up.</i>

40:19.310 --> 40:21.241
It's like taking candy
from a baby.

40:21.310 --> 40:22.655
- All you gotta do
is swing first.

40:22.724 --> 40:24.000
That's all you gotta do.
- Or you gonna swing first?

40:24.068 --> 40:25.482
- You going to?
You going to?

40:25.551 --> 40:26.758
- You gonna swing first?
- You going to?

40:26.827 --> 40:28.448
- Of course we're fighting
over this.

40:28.517 --> 40:29.517
Why wouldn't we be?

40:35.000 --> 40:37.172
- You don't hold me back.

40:37.241 --> 40:39.482
<i>Damn.
[indistinct].</i>

40:39.551 --> 40:40.551
<i>Ripped his toenail off.</i>

40:40.620 --> 40:42.034
Hey, charge it to the game.

40:44.206 --> 40:45.655
- Oh,
My bad, bro, for real.

40:45.724 --> 40:46.862
- Ow.
My toenail fell off.

40:46.931 --> 40:48.586
- Your toenail came off?
- Yeah.

40:48.655 --> 40:50.896
- Kirk, I'll give you
another $500 if you put that--

40:50.965 --> 40:52.655
- Hey,
I'm not suckin' that [bleep]!

40:52.724 --> 40:54.172
<i>- Probably has to</i>

40:54.241 --> 40:56.034
take the ranks
of the dumbest fight ever.

40:56.103 --> 40:57.827
- Hell no!
- I got $500

40:57.896 --> 40:59.068
if you suck that [bleep]!

40:59.137 --> 41:01.689
-
Codi, shut the up!

41:03.137 --> 41:05.724
<i>- Well,
that'll be good for the promo.</i>

41:07.689 --> 41:11.758
<i>- Made in Georgia.</i>

41:14.586 --> 41:15.931
- Dear heavenly Father,
uplift Jeremiah.

41:16.000 --> 41:16.896
<i>We ask that he has
a wonderful birthday.</i>

41:16.965 --> 41:18.206
- We got
our hot wing competition

41:18.275 --> 41:20.068
from lowest to hottest.

41:20.137 --> 41:21.517
- Ah!

41:21.586 --> 41:22.896
<i>- To be honest with you,
I don't think there's</i>

41:22.965 --> 41:24.137
<i>any chance at all
that this prank goes</i>

41:24.206 --> 41:25.551
<i>and there's not
one kind of problem.</i>

41:29.896 --> 41:31.724
<i>-</i>
