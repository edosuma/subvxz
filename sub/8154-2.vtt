00:31.798 --> 00:34.096
Honey, I'm home.

00:58.792 --> 01:00.226
[Baby] Waah! Waah!

01:00.294 --> 01:01.819
I'm crying.
That means I'm up!

01:01.895 --> 01:05.832
- [Fran] Earl?
- [Earl snoring]

01:05.899 --> 01:07.560
- What?
- [Fran] Come on, Earl.

01:07.634 --> 01:09.432
You get up for once.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.062
[animal shrieking]

01:11.138 --> 01:13.197
[Fran] Earl, feed the baby.

01:13.273 --> 01:14.365
[Earl] Why?

01:14.441 --> 01:17.741
[Fran] Because if you
don't feed it it'll die.

01:17.811 --> 01:21.975
- [Earl] How many other kids we got?
- [Fran] Two.

01:22.049 --> 01:24.814
[Earl snores]

01:24.885 --> 01:27.013
[Baby] Giddyup, Mommy. Giddyup.

01:29.356 --> 01:32.087

01:44.104 --> 01:46.266
Why don't you sleep?

01:46.340 --> 01:49.173

01:53.213 --> 01:56.274
Please, please.
Mommy needs some sleep.

01:56.350 --> 01:59.843
I haven't had any sleep
since the night you were hatched.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.787
I love being up
with the mama.

02:02.856 --> 02:05.723
Ah, is that why you wake me up
at 3:00 in the morning,

02:05.792 --> 02:08.056
just to be with me?

02:08.127 --> 02:11.758
Yeah, well, that and
I'm hungry! Feed my mouth!

02:11.832 --> 02:14.824

02:26.947 --> 02:29.075
- OK.
- Hurry, Mommy. Hurry.

02:29.149 --> 02:33.052
- Give it. Give it, Mommy!
- Here you go, sweetheart.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.884
Right there.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.321
[sucking]

02:42.930 --> 02:44.989
Delish!

02:45.065 --> 02:46.123
Uh-oh.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.726
Uh-oh!
Oh. Stomach growling.

02:48.802 --> 02:51.271
Pressure. I'm gonna blow up!
I'm gonna blow up!

02:51.338 --> 02:52.897
Oh, I'm gonna blow!

02:52.973 --> 02:55.772
Oh, I'm gonna blow! Clear!

02:55.843 --> 02:57.811

- [rattling]

03:07.721 --> 03:09.553
Well!

03:09.623 --> 03:13.321
Now you really
must, must go to sleep.

03:13.393 --> 03:15.259
Whoa, hey!

03:15.329 --> 03:16.728
We're gonna walk.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.458
We're gonna do the tour.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.125
Wow! I love the tour.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.690
I'm gaga for the tour.

03:21.768 --> 03:24.601
Walk, walk, walk.
Hey, wait a minute!

03:24.671 --> 03:26.196
You're trying to put me to...

03:26.273 --> 03:28.435
- [snoring]
- I don't believe you.

03:28.509 --> 03:29.908
I don't blame you.

03:29.977 --> 03:33.379
I'm gonna do this
all night. [laughs]

03:47.728 --> 03:49.025
[snoring]

04:09.683 --> 04:11.708
Hey, Mom, did you
make breakfast?

04:11.785 --> 04:15.779
You're always saying that breakfast is
the most important meal of the day.

04:15.856 --> 04:18.826
I understand that from
a nutrition point of view.

04:18.892 --> 04:23.125
You always say I'm still growing
and that if I don't have breakfast,

04:23.197 --> 04:26.462
I'll just end up looking like
a little stunted anthropod.

04:26.533 --> 04:28.592
I appreciate that
and everything,

04:28.669 --> 04:30.034
I really do.

04:30.103 --> 04:33.300
Uh... except today.
I don't have time for breakfast.

04:33.373 --> 04:36.502
I've got early practice for
the game against Mesopotamia.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.912
Cereal?
Come on. Cereal?

04:42.983 --> 04:44.678
I want something hot.

04:44.751 --> 04:47.812
I want two waffles with
an animal in the middle.

04:47.888 --> 04:50.118
Can you whip that up? Huh?

04:57.097 --> 04:58.531
Don't give me any trouble.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.693
[creatures grumbling]

05:07.741 --> 05:09.004
[horn honks]

05:09.076 --> 05:11.272
[Charlene]
There's my ride.

05:11.345 --> 05:13.109
Oh! Bruno's in the car!

05:13.180 --> 05:16.480
Oh! How do I look?
How do I look, huh?

05:17.484 --> 05:18.713
Charlene?

05:18.785 --> 05:21.413
Mom, get some sleep.

05:21.488 --> 05:22.978
Bye.

05:23.991 --> 05:27.256
[tires screeching]

05:31.431 --> 05:33.195
[sighs]

05:36.436 --> 05:39.633
[creature] Gimme. Gimme,
gimme, gimme, gimme!

05:39.706 --> 05:42.141
[gobbling]

05:42.209 --> 05:44.337
Waffles!

05:46.046 --> 05:48.344
[birds calling]

05:48.415 --> 05:49.576
[caveman language]

06:08.035 --> 06:10.129
Frannie, I know
your days are awful full,

06:10.204 --> 06:11.968
what, with your bonbon lunches

06:12.039 --> 06:14.007
and girl chat at the produce counter,

06:14.074 --> 06:16.634
but maybe you could
put a button on this shirt

06:16.710 --> 06:19.372
I've been asking you
to put on since last night.

06:19.446 --> 06:20.971
[gasps]

06:21.048 --> 06:22.447
[groans]

06:22.516 --> 06:24.507
I've been up since
3:30 this morning,

06:24.585 --> 06:26.883
and the baby
wouldn't stop crying.

06:26.954 --> 06:29.048
You had a tough night
with junior?

06:29.122 --> 06:33.184
Robbie came in and said, "I want."
And Charlene came in and said, "I want."

06:33.260 --> 06:36.958
All right, I'll just run over
an antelope on my way to work,

06:37.030 --> 06:41.490
have some for breakfast, put the rest
in the lunchbox, I'm covered.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.559
Stop talking!
You're talking too loud.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.571
Wake that baby,
I'll bite your head off.

06:45.639 --> 06:48.233
Well, nobody wants that.

06:48.308 --> 06:50.504
All'l do is cook and clean

06:50.577 --> 06:53.842
and clean and cook,
that's all I ever do.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.678
I'm turning into a drudge.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.241
Earl, am I a drudge?

06:58.318 --> 07:02.152
Uh...uh...

07:02.222 --> 07:04.384
I love you?

07:04.458 --> 07:08.122
Oh. Cook and clean,
clean and cook.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.822
That's all I ever do.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.558
These are the tools
of my trade.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.532
How's my favorite
married couple?

07:13.600 --> 07:15.329
Fran, put the knife down.

07:15.402 --> 07:17.734
OK, see you at work.

07:17.805 --> 07:20.502
Right behind you.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.565
Oh! Whoa!

07:25.846 --> 07:28.008
I don't get what
the big deal is.

07:28.081 --> 07:29.879
We all have our parts to play.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.146
I'm the breadwinner,
and she's the drudge.

07:32.219 --> 07:33.414
Where's the problem?

07:33.487 --> 07:37.253
Well, we are in uncharted
territory now, pally boy.

07:37.324 --> 07:40.885
This new thing with
dinosaurs getting married

07:40.961 --> 07:43.453
has thrown the conventional
wisdom out the window.

07:43.530 --> 07:45.897
All right. Let's try to
get a handle on this.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.594
I've got a wife's who's
unhappy about something.

07:48.669 --> 07:51.730
This is without
historical precedent.

07:52.406 --> 07:54.238
OK. Let's think.

07:54.308 --> 07:56.834
Yeah. We should be able
to figure this out.

07:56.910 --> 08:00.778
Yeah, we got brains
the size of walnuts.

08:13.393 --> 08:15.623
All right.
What about this?

08:15.696 --> 08:17.926
Fran's, like, broken, right?

08:17.998 --> 08:19.557
I got a broken wife.

08:19.633 --> 08:22.034
So, what do you do
if your car is broken?

08:22.102 --> 08:25.732
Uh... you kick it
and leave it by the road.

08:25.806 --> 08:29.174
Yeah, but what if
you're used to your car,

08:29.243 --> 08:32.144
and you've put on a few pounds
since you met your car,

08:32.212 --> 08:34.840
and you're not sure if you
can attract another car?

08:35.515 --> 08:38.577
Are we really talking
about cars, here, pally boy?

08:38.652 --> 08:40.313
I don't know
what the problem is.

08:40.386 --> 08:42.822
She's been upset ever
since the baby was born.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.619
She wasn't upset
before the baby.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.284
Before the baby, not upset.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.260
After the baby, upset.

08:48.328 --> 08:51.025
Baby, upset.
No baby, no upset.

08:52.566 --> 08:54.125
You lost me completely.

08:54.201 --> 08:57.398
It's the baby! It's the baby
and the house and the kids.

08:57.471 --> 08:59.838
It's too much for her.
She needs some time off.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.602
But if she takes some time off,

09:01.675 --> 09:04.474
then who looks after the kids?

09:14.421 --> 09:16.685
I am so hungry.

09:17.758 --> 09:20.056
- You could do it.
- Huh?

09:20.127 --> 09:22.255
You could take
the kids for a weekend.

09:22.329 --> 09:23.854
Why would I
want to do that?

09:23.931 --> 09:26.525
Well, because it's
just one weekend.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.090
And when she gets back,

09:28.168 --> 09:30.296
she'll be relaxed
and refreshed

09:30.370 --> 09:33.431
and ready to go again
like a brand-new drudge.

09:33.507 --> 09:35.839
Yeah. I guess I could
look after my kids

09:35.909 --> 09:37.536
for a couple of days,

09:37.611 --> 09:39.807
seeing as how it's
in my own self-interest.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.871
Well, we did it.

09:42.983 --> 09:46.749
We had a problem, gave it some thought,
and we solved it.

09:46.820 --> 09:49.551
- And I feel pretty good.
- Me too.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.955
What day is this?

09:52.025 --> 09:55.154
- I have no idea.
- Oh.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.527
Not the mama!
Not the mama!

09:57.598 --> 09:59.965
Not the mama!
Not the mama!

10:00.033 --> 10:03.196
Not the mama!
Not the mama! Not the mama!

10:03.270 --> 10:07.605
You do that one more time, and
I'm going to throw you across the room!

10:09.309 --> 10:11.937
- Not the mama!
- Ahh!

10:12.012 --> 10:13.138
Wee! Oof!

10:16.550 --> 10:18.018
Again!

10:19.219 --> 10:20.380
What's for dinner?

10:20.454 --> 10:21.853
I don't like your attitude.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.253
[gasps]

10:25.826 --> 10:27.521
It doesn't look done to me.

10:27.594 --> 10:30.063
It's done.
It's damn done.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.531
Hey! You give me that back,
or I'll kill you.

10:32.599 --> 10:34.158
Here you go, ace.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.532
Next time you might
want to turn the oven on.

10:36.603 --> 10:38.230
Uh, just a thought.

10:43.010 --> 10:45.570
So, what do you think really
happened to Mom?

10:45.646 --> 10:48.115
Nervous breakdown,
carried off by predators?

10:48.182 --> 10:49.707
Dad said she's at Grandma's.

10:49.783 --> 10:52.275
Isn't that what they
always tell the children.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.781
Hey, Dad, when's Mom
coming back from Grandma's?

10:55.856 --> 10:58.985
When she's recuperated from you.
Until then, I'm the mother.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.892
OK, Mom, can I go
to a movie tonight?

11:01.962 --> 11:03.293
Not a chance!

11:05.098 --> 11:06.862
Dad said I could.

11:09.570 --> 11:11.868
Uh... he really did?

11:11.939 --> 11:12.929
Mm-hmm.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.475
Dad, I had a late lunch.
See you later.

11:15.542 --> 11:16.976
Where are you going?

11:17.044 --> 11:19.138
Out with the guys
to mark some territory.

11:19.213 --> 11:20.237
Take a sweater.

11:20.314 --> 11:23.511
Wait! If he gets
to go out, I do too.

11:23.584 --> 11:25.416
Ahh!

11:25.486 --> 11:27.887
Oh! Oh!

11:27.955 --> 11:29.582
I slaved over a hot oven

11:29.656 --> 11:31.522
making a nice dinner
for you kids,

11:31.592 --> 11:34.527
and now you'll sit at this table
and eat that dinner

11:34.595 --> 11:37.565
and express proper gratitude
to your mother/father!

11:37.631 --> 11:39.998
[groaning]

11:40.067 --> 11:41.432
He's stuck there.

11:41.502 --> 11:43.937
And yet we can move freely.

11:45.305 --> 11:46.568
- 'Night!
- 'Night!

11:46.640 --> 11:49.439
You don't think I'll
let go of this table

11:49.510 --> 11:50.944
to come after you two?

11:51.011 --> 11:54.413
I'm telling you,
you're playing with fire!

11:54.481 --> 11:56.506
No. I'm playing with fire.

11:56.583 --> 11:57.812
What?

11:57.885 --> 11:58.977
[laughs] Ooh.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.417
Oh!

12:01.421 --> 12:03.549
Oh! Oh! Oh!

12:03.624 --> 12:05.592
[laughing]

12:05.659 --> 12:07.252
- Daddy!
- What?

12:07.327 --> 12:09.386
- Hot.
- Oh!

12:09.463 --> 12:10.692
Where are we going?

12:10.764 --> 12:13.358
[Baby laughing]

12:16.270 --> 12:17.362
Again!

12:17.437 --> 12:19.565
Not again!
Not ever again!

12:19.640 --> 12:21.005
No more of this for me.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.441
Tomorrow I go back to work,
and I'm only grateful

12:23.510 --> 12:25.444
that I am not the one
who has to do this

12:25.512 --> 12:28.379
for the rest of my life.

12:29.716 --> 12:32.651
The mama.

12:32.719 --> 12:33.914
Hi, honey.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.250
How was your day?

12:37.090 --> 12:39.855
No, no, no, Fran.
Don't explode.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.952
Everything's all right.

12:42.029 --> 12:43.224
Take another day away.

12:43.297 --> 12:46.198
I don't want another day away.
I missed it here.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.927
But you were unhappy here.

12:48.001 --> 12:50.766
- But I was unhappy away.
- Now, Fran, make sense.

12:50.838 --> 12:53.603
There's only here and away.
The kids made you unhappy,

12:53.674 --> 12:55.904
I gave you a whole weekend off
from the kids.

12:55.976 --> 12:58.411
- Now you're fixed.
- It's not the kids.

12:58.479 --> 13:00.777
Earl, there's something
wrong in my life,

13:00.848 --> 13:02.475
and I don't know what it is.

13:02.549 --> 13:05.416
Your life? What life?
Your life is me and the kids.

13:05.486 --> 13:08.421
All right, look.
Here's your life.

13:08.489 --> 13:10.355
This is the kids.

13:10.424 --> 13:11.448
OK?

13:11.525 --> 13:14.790
And this is... this is me.

13:14.862 --> 13:18.389
OK, now, if it's not the kids...

13:18.465 --> 13:19.990
...what is it?

13:20.067 --> 13:21.831
[telephone rings]

13:22.903 --> 13:25.133
Hello. Roy?

13:25.205 --> 13:27.469
It's me.

13:30.244 --> 13:32.474
[sighs] You should
have seen her, Roy,

13:32.546 --> 13:34.378
just standing there
looking at me.

13:34.448 --> 13:36.644
It made me feel so bad,
it was all I could do

13:36.717 --> 13:39.015
to leave the house
and come down to the bar.

13:39.086 --> 13:41.555
- What does she want from you?
- She doesn't know.

13:41.622 --> 13:44.057
As I understand it,
she does not know.

13:44.124 --> 13:46.149
So then why do you
have to do anything?

13:46.226 --> 13:47.990
Because I'm the problem.

13:48.061 --> 13:50.758
Look, Earl,
I've known you 27 years.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.959
That's longer
than Fran's known you.

13:53.033 --> 13:56.333
And in all that time, I never
thought of you as a problem once.

13:56.403 --> 13:57.962
Yeah, but you're my pal.

13:58.038 --> 14:01.008
Well, what about the rest of you guys?
You know Earl.

14:01.074 --> 14:03.566
Has anybody here got
a problem with him?

14:03.644 --> 14:07.877
- He's a good guy.
- We love you, big guy.

14:09.783 --> 14:13.344
Look, you're a room full of guys,
and the problem's with the wife.

14:13.420 --> 14:16.822
And the wife is female,
so maybe what you've got

14:16.890 --> 14:19.018
is a male/female problem.

14:19.092 --> 14:22.494
What kind of male/female problem?
We're married a long time,

14:22.563 --> 14:24.258
and we just had a new kid.

14:24.331 --> 14:26.732
Anyway, just this morning
I said, "I love you."

14:26.800 --> 14:30.327
- Did you say it sincerely?
- Nah. It was a defense mechanism.

14:30.404 --> 14:33.430
When was the last time
you did the mating dance?

14:33.507 --> 14:36.442
- What are you talking about?
- The mating dance.

14:36.510 --> 14:39.070
The ultimate expression

14:39.146 --> 14:42.980
of a male's absolute commitment
to a female.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.144
[screams]

14:45.219 --> 14:48.211
I myself do it three,
four times a week.

14:48.288 --> 14:52.384
The mating dance is a courtship ritual.
You do it to woo and win.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.621
I wooed.
I'won. I'm done.

14:54.695 --> 14:56.686
Maybe it's time to re-woo.

14:56.763 --> 14:59.198
I don't have to. I got her.
She's in the house.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.792
Maybe the mating dance
isn't just to get her.

15:01.869 --> 15:04.566
Maybe it's to keep her.

15:04.638 --> 15:08.199
Forget it. You don't do the mating dance
for a 38-year-old mother.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.710
- Why not?
- Because.

15:10.777 --> 15:12.108
Because what?

15:12.179 --> 15:15.342
Because... uh...

15:15.415 --> 15:17.884
I forget how.

15:21.755 --> 15:23.951
[male on TV]
And finally, in local news,

15:24.024 --> 15:26.254
officials at the city zoo
report no luck

15:26.326 --> 15:28.727
in trying to mate
Ling-Ling and Chang-Chang,

15:28.795 --> 15:31.127
the two rare
imported humans.

15:31.198 --> 15:32.723
Zookeepers are baffled

15:32.800 --> 15:35.098
at why two seemingly
healthy cavepeople

15:35.169 --> 15:37.228
have not yet
produced offspring.

15:37.304 --> 15:41.434
At this point, it's feared
that Ling-Ling is barren.

15:41.508 --> 15:42.998
And now for the weather.

15:43.076 --> 15:44.441
I'm going to bed.

15:44.511 --> 15:46.343
Oh, OK.

15:47.347 --> 15:50.044
I'm not cleaning anything up.
I'm just going to bed.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.609
- OK.
- Don't expect anything from me.

15:52.686 --> 15:53.778
I wouldn't.

15:53.854 --> 15:56.551
And if you lose a button,
whose problem is that?

15:56.623 --> 15:58.318
Mine, all mine.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.325
Good night, dear.

16:01.395 --> 16:04.057
[Fran] Don't patronize me.

16:04.131 --> 16:07.101
[male 2 on TV] Hey, guys,
wanna make more of an impression

16:07.167 --> 16:08.601
with the ladies?

16:08.669 --> 16:10.103
From time immemorial,

16:10.170 --> 16:12.400
dinosaurs have known
there's only one way

16:12.472 --> 16:14.031
to a woman's heart.

16:14.108 --> 16:17.237
It's not flowers.
It's not candy.

16:17.311 --> 16:20.212
Yes, it's the mating dance.

16:20.280 --> 16:23.306
Whether you're a beginner
wanting to learn first steps

16:23.383 --> 16:24.748
for after the prom

16:24.818 --> 16:26.616
or an old married guy

16:26.687 --> 16:29.657
with a wife who's overwhelmed
by one kid too many,

16:29.723 --> 16:32.693
Mel Luster's
Mating Dance Academy

16:32.759 --> 16:34.284

16:37.397 --> 16:38.990

16:39.066 --> 16:42.730

16:42.803 --> 16:44.396

16:44.471 --> 16:47.099
in the heart of
the seedy part of town.

16:53.781 --> 16:56.443
Hey, you in the door,
how can I help you?

16:56.517 --> 16:57.780
Oh, uh, me?

16:57.851 --> 17:01.446
Well, I'm here for
the $29.95 refresher course.

17:01.522 --> 17:03.650
Well, come on.
Let's get started.

17:03.724 --> 17:06.056
Let's try, uh, a bob dip.

17:06.126 --> 17:08.117
Can you bob dip for me?

17:08.194 --> 17:10.664
Well, I, uh... uh...

17:10.731 --> 17:13.200
OK. Not at all.

17:13.267 --> 17:14.996
Well, we're open all night.

17:16.002 --> 17:19.371
- [Mel] Bend, will you bend?
- [Earl] Come on, I've got such a cramp.

17:19.439 --> 17:20.964
I'm not as young
as I used to be.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.601
- [Mel] How old are you?
- [Earl] Uh... 28.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.166
Yeah. Right.

17:43.330 --> 17:48.825
Let's see how Marilyn,
our blushing bachelorette, liked it.

17:48.902 --> 17:52.361
Oh! I could spend the rest
of my life with you.

17:52.439 --> 17:55.033
Thanks. I'm married.

17:55.109 --> 17:58.602
- $29.95. Pay Mel.
- Yeah, OK.

18:00.747 --> 18:04.479
Mel, it's a beautiful thing you do.

18:04.551 --> 18:06.610
Oh, it's very fulfilling.

I've been out taking
care of your problem.

You'll be happy to know that you
don't have a problem anymore.

18:52.232 --> 18:54.667
I'm so happy.
Good night.

18:54.735 --> 18:56.294
No, no, no! Look!

18:56.370 --> 18:58.771
You're gonna want to see this.
It's important.

18:58.839 --> 19:01.774

just for you.
