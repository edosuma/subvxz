00:00.572 --> 00:02.586
You can do magic, Felix.

00:02.588 --> 00:04.908
- You're a true witch?
- So she says.

00:04.909 --> 00:07.214
- What's that book?
- It's my Book of Shadows.

00:07.215 --> 00:10.351
- You have your own spells?
- The spell has to be cast by someone.

00:10.352 --> 00:12.824
The question is,
what spell and who casts it?

00:12.825 --> 00:14.731
- See something?
- No.

00:14.732 --> 00:17.991
It's Jake, your son.
Mum, what's wrong?

00:17.992 --> 00:21.028
- Mum, you OK?
- Ugh, I feel horrible.

00:24.672 --> 00:26.852
You boys have a demon after you.

00:26.912 --> 00:29.052
A bonafide,
hell-bent-on-murder demon.

01:16.488 --> 01:19.488
Synced by pleven4ever & Reef

01:25.032 --> 01:27.132
Happy Mother's Day, Mum.

01:27.192 --> 01:30.495
Ahh, thank you, sweetie.

01:44.592 --> 01:49.277
It's beautiful, darling.
It's beautiful.

01:51.793 --> 01:54.935
It can go right over there
next to the others.

02:02.203 --> 02:05.972
- Is today Mother's Day?
- Yeah, that's right.

02:06.362 --> 02:09.292
Every Mother's Day, me and my
brothers always promise my Mum

02:09.293 --> 02:11.075
we won't fight
for the whole day.

02:11.198 --> 02:15.061
In our world, me and Mum would be
getting ready for the game right now.

02:15.397 --> 02:18.937
My Dad always tells me
and my brother to make a card,

02:19.021 --> 02:23.383
and then my brother gives my Mum
the card, and she cries.

02:25.112 --> 02:27.459
Stop distracting me.

02:27.460 --> 02:30.790
This is our only protection
against the demon, and it's broken.

02:30.791 --> 02:34.183
- Yeah, thanks Sam.
- I was possessed!

02:34.358 --> 02:36.298
Did you find Alice's spell?

02:36.358 --> 02:39.178
She's your best chance
to defeat the demon.

02:39.238 --> 02:42.470
- Is she that powerful?
- Yep.

02:42.718 --> 02:45.778
I don't know what's taking you
so long, Felix.

02:45.838 --> 02:48.698
I stayed up all night.

02:48.699 --> 02:51.888
Hey Jake, where did you put
the brush and pan thing?

02:52.278 --> 02:54.618
Oh, great.

02:54.619 --> 02:56.558
Weren't we all supposed
to stick together?

02:56.559 --> 02:59.873
Well, technically
without the talisman, why bother?

02:59.874 --> 03:02.077
I was possessed, alright?

03:02.078 --> 03:04.950
Guys, the demon could be back
at any time.

03:04.951 --> 03:06.698
And Jake's on his own.

03:33.329 --> 03:35.618
- Ooh!
- Whoops, there you go.

03:35.678 --> 03:40.818
- Oh, that was close! Thank you.
- No worries.

03:40.869 --> 03:43.581
You shouldn't even be up there.
You're afraid of heights.

03:43.582 --> 03:47.735
- How do you know that?
- Ah, Mr. Bates mentioned it.

03:47.754 --> 03:49.973
He talks a lot, doesn't he?

03:51.718 --> 03:54.016
So what are you doing
back here again?

03:54.017 --> 03:56.357
Oh, I thought
I'd check up on you,

03:56.358 --> 03:58.968
'cause you were like sick
or something the other day.

03:59.139 --> 04:01.649
Well, you're very sweet.

04:01.722 --> 04:04.702
Your mother's lucky
she has such a considerate son.

04:04.746 --> 04:08.361
Ah, my Mum's not...
around.

04:08.386 --> 04:11.536
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh no, she's not...

04:11.974 --> 04:14.098
It's complicated.

04:15.758 --> 04:19.712
- Hey, do you want a job?
- Sure.

04:20.038 --> 04:23.097
What are we gonna do
if the demon comes back?

04:23.098 --> 04:26.789
We barely escaped last time when it was
my girlfriend, and she's a pacifist.

04:26.790 --> 04:28.250
Even though she was smaller,

04:28.251 --> 04:30.911
Demon Mia was stronger and faster
than Demon Roland.

04:30.912 --> 04:34.452
- The demon is definitely evolving.
- You never have good news, do you?

04:34.453 --> 04:36.537
Well, the good news is every time
we defeat it,

04:36.538 --> 04:39.118
the demon takes a while
to get its strength back.

04:39.119 --> 04:41.732
- How long is <i>a while?</i>
- Not very long.

04:41.734 --> 04:45.354
- I wonder how it will change next?
- I don't wanna know.

04:47.211 --> 04:48.751
Breakdancing.

04:50.511 --> 04:54.251
So what do you like at school, Jake?
What's your best subject?

04:54.373 --> 04:57.593
- Football.
- I'm a huge Bandicoots fan.

04:57.594 --> 05:01.833
I know. I mean, everyone
around here is, aren't they?

05:01.958 --> 05:04.978
- Oh, not Brian. He hates it.
- Really?

05:05.038 --> 05:09.498
- Who do you go to the games with?
- Oh, I don't go to the games.

05:09.558 --> 05:12.711
- But you always go.
- Yeah, I used to.

05:13.088 --> 05:15.541
How did you know that?

05:15.945 --> 05:18.017
Where would Jake go?

05:18.860 --> 05:23.211
- What about his Mum's place?
- Anyone know where Bates lives?

05:27.666 --> 05:29.206
Mum.

05:37.614 --> 05:41.656
Oh, man.
This really sucks.

05:53.995 --> 05:56.495
Oh man, my Mum makes
the best sausages.

05:56.496 --> 05:59.436
- Not as good as my Mum.
- My Mum's are awful.

05:59.492 --> 06:02.512
- But I eat them anyway.
- Does anyone have any money?

06:02.525 --> 06:05.836
Oh, yeah. I've got some left over
from skate busking.

06:08.982 --> 06:12.844
- Job's all done.
- How about we get something to eat?

06:13.780 --> 06:16.280
- Good?
- Yeah.

06:17.063 --> 06:22.405
- Let me guess. BLT.
- That's my favourite.

06:22.406 --> 06:25.797
Oh, good guess, eh?

06:26.501 --> 06:28.501
Let's see what I can do.

06:36.475 --> 06:39.015
You're that boy
that came to our house.

06:39.075 --> 06:42.295
Yeah, sorry about that.
It's kind of a misunderstanding.

06:42.355 --> 06:47.095
- Peculiar misunderstanding.
- Um, yeah, I guess.

06:47.155 --> 06:50.095
It's OK. I'm used to teenage boys
and their secrets.

06:52.635 --> 06:54.895
Um, happy Mother's Day.

06:54.955 --> 06:57.113
Oh, thanks Felix.
That's so kind.

06:57.114 --> 06:58.977
- Like some sauce?
- Yes, please.

06:58.978 --> 07:02.156
You know, Oscar would love it if you'd
come over and stay for the weekend.

07:02.157 --> 07:04.537
- That'd be great.
- If it's alright with your Aunty.

07:04.538 --> 07:06.544
I'm sure I could convince her.

07:06.843 --> 07:09.255
- No, you're not.
- I'm your son!

07:09.268 --> 07:10.688
- You're not.
- I am.

07:10.689 --> 07:12.269
You're not.

07:12.270 --> 07:13.935
Well, how's the family?

07:13.936 --> 07:16.805
We haven't had any break-ins
recently, so that's a plus.

07:16.806 --> 07:19.391
Is Nai-Nai still hiding her glasses
because she hates them?

07:19.392 --> 07:20.852
How did you know that?

07:20.853 --> 07:23.329
Bottom dresser drawer,
second living room.

07:23.343 --> 07:26.807
- Who are you?
- I'm your son!

07:30.315 --> 07:33.055
- What is it?
- I feel sick.

07:35.016 --> 07:37.396
- What's wrong?
- Stupid allergies.

07:37.413 --> 07:40.473
- Are you OK?
- I don't feel well.

07:40.604 --> 07:42.635
Maybe you should take a seat.

07:46.475 --> 07:48.099
- What happened?
- I don't know.

07:48.124 --> 07:49.933
You okay?

07:50.326 --> 07:51.986
Call an ambulance.

08:09.054 --> 08:10.947
Sarah?

08:18.303 --> 08:20.003
Sarah?

08:23.072 --> 08:24.692
Hello?

08:29.352 --> 08:31.052
Hello?

08:35.792 --> 08:37.692
Sarah...?

08:41.832 --> 08:43.616
Nice...

08:46.352 --> 08:49.132
Mum! Mum!

08:49.192 --> 08:50.772
Mum, wake up!

08:55.152 --> 08:58.652
Mum, please wake up!
Wake up...

09:10.712 --> 09:13.052
There's something wrong
with all of them.

09:13.112 --> 09:15.892
- What is it?
- The sausages...?

09:16.256 --> 09:18.636
Demon attack.

09:23.752 --> 09:25.372
Is she gonna be OK?

09:25.432 --> 09:29.572
We'll have her in emergency in no time.
She'll get the best care possible.

09:31.706 --> 09:34.046
- Can I come?
- You family?

09:34.620 --> 09:36.160
- No...
- What's going on?

09:36.161 --> 09:39.479
- Sorry, mate. We've gotta get moving.
- Jake, what are you doing here?

09:39.480 --> 09:40.900
Sarah?

09:43.111 --> 09:44.251
Sarah!

09:44.459 --> 09:45.879
<i>Phoebe, Phoebe!</i>

09:46.041 --> 09:48.820
What is it with the teenage boys
always shouting?

09:48.821 --> 09:51.206
Something's happening to our Mums.
They're really sick.

09:51.207 --> 09:54.334
First the bees, then the dogs.
Now the demon's attacking our mums.

09:54.335 --> 09:57.018
On Mother's Day!
It's pure evil.

09:57.526 --> 10:00.511
OK, boys.
Let's hit the books.

10:00.512 --> 10:04.125
They all had rashes on their arms, like
they were fighting something toxic.

10:04.126 --> 10:06.947
There's nothing in here
about the demon attacking blood kin.

10:06.948 --> 10:09.704
- Did the rash have a spiral pattern?
- Definitely not.

10:09.705 --> 10:12.045
Then it may not be
the restoring demon.

10:12.046 --> 10:13.666
You're right.

10:14.441 --> 10:16.181
What other demon could it be?

10:16.182 --> 10:19.198
- Is there a banishment spell in here?
- What if it's not a demon?

10:19.199 --> 10:20.440
What else would it be?

10:20.441 --> 10:22.805
This has been happening
since we first came here.

10:22.806 --> 10:24.546
Every time we're around our Mums.

10:24.547 --> 10:26.517
My Mum started sneezing
when she saw me.

10:26.518 --> 10:28.782
Yeah, my Mum's had that rash before.

10:28.783 --> 10:31.283
It's like our mothers
have become allergic to us.

10:31.284 --> 10:34.527
Magic hayfever?
Bummer...

10:34.604 --> 10:36.459
So, what do we do?

10:37.615 --> 10:39.995
Magic antihistamine.

10:40.684 --> 10:42.101
Of course!

10:42.102 --> 10:45.702
If our mothers are allergic to us,
it's because we shouldn't be here.

10:45.703 --> 10:47.738
We're like foreign bodies to them.

10:47.887 --> 10:51.986
But what if we could connect to them with
magic, so we don't seem foreign anymore?

10:51.987 --> 10:53.891
Like magical inoculation.

10:53.892 --> 10:55.472
- Genius.
- Really?

10:55.473 --> 10:58.343
Really.
We need a spell.

10:58.676 --> 11:02.136
- Don't we need the talisman to work?
- Not necessarily.

11:02.282 --> 11:05.582
I mean, if we can find another object
with magical properties...

11:08.887 --> 11:10.427
This isn't right.

11:12.876 --> 11:17.496
But if we can add a bit from here,
we might have something.

11:17.985 --> 11:21.696
- Is that what I think it is?
- No, it's just my diary... thing.

11:21.697 --> 11:24.232
- Why has it got magic spells in it?
- I write everything down.

11:24.233 --> 11:27.785
We're wasting time. Is anyone interested
in putting this spell together?

11:27.786 --> 11:30.487
Yes. What ingredients do you need?

11:30.488 --> 11:32.782
Guys, I need your help.

11:36.211 --> 11:38.757
This is a healing spell
combined with a protection spell.

11:38.758 --> 11:39.952
Will that work?

11:39.953 --> 11:41.832
If we activate it
with powerful ingredients.

11:41.833 --> 11:44.917
- Like us?
- No, this time we need more.

11:44.967 --> 11:46.828
It's about us and our mothers.

11:46.830 --> 11:48.930
So we have to find objects
that belong to them,

11:48.931 --> 11:51.831
but we also have to connect to them,
like forging a link.

11:51.860 --> 11:54.505
- So things that exist in both worlds?
- Exactly.

11:54.506 --> 11:56.606
My Mum's got a completely different
life here.

11:56.607 --> 11:58.177
She doesn't even
live in the same house.

11:58.178 --> 12:00.238
There must be something
she still has.

12:00.746 --> 12:04.665
Dolphins. Even when she was a little kid.
I bet she still collects them.

12:04.666 --> 12:07.250
We don't have time to do this
together. We have to split up.

12:07.251 --> 12:10.665
If you save our mums, dude,
forget everything I said about you.

12:10.666 --> 12:13.007
About being a freak.
You're cool.

12:13.501 --> 12:17.280
Let's meet up at the hospital. We have
to be nearby for the spell to work.

12:17.281 --> 12:18.701
Let's do it.

12:33.697 --> 12:35.670
Come on, come on...

12:47.986 --> 12:50.166
Where are you?

13:22.506 --> 13:25.326
Do we know what's wrong
with these women?

13:25.327 --> 13:27.347
Can we do an IV check?

13:58.106 --> 14:01.723
She never puts anything
where you expect to find it.

14:18.814 --> 14:20.394
What you want, ghost boy?

14:20.395 --> 14:23.015
Mum's sick, Nai-Nai.
They've taken her to hospital.

14:23.075 --> 14:27.455
That girl!
Always something wrong with her.

14:40.475 --> 14:45.870
Ah, Sir Weed Killer,
we meet again.

14:46.834 --> 14:50.334
- I need a photo of grandad.
- What for?

14:50.355 --> 14:53.535
- A magic spell.
- Oh, OK.

14:54.570 --> 14:55.849
Here.

14:56.115 --> 14:59.975
- Thanks, Nai-Nai.
- No problem, ghost boy.

15:05.288 --> 15:08.388
My Mum always said
I look just like my grandfather.

15:08.389 --> 15:11.039
Yeah, in about 60 years
that'll be you.

15:11.075 --> 15:12.500
What'd you get?

15:12.501 --> 15:14.480
I got my Mum's favourite book,

15:14.515 --> 15:17.630
I got her favourite CD,
the paintbrush she uses,

15:17.631 --> 15:20.424
a pair of running shoes 'cause
she likes running, and an egg timer.

15:20.425 --> 15:21.546
Why?

15:21.547 --> 15:23.950
- I don't know, I got confused.
- Well, you better pick one.

15:23.951 --> 15:26.993
We have to prepare the
spell and we're running out of time.

15:32.894 --> 15:34.514
- Where's Jake.
- I don't know.

15:34.515 --> 15:36.874
But we need him
or the spell won't work.

15:43.350 --> 15:47.186
I've just found something magical,
and now you want me to find Jake?

15:48.081 --> 15:49.895
Alright, alright.

15:50.795 --> 15:53.295
- Has there been any response?
- Afraid not, Doctor.

15:53.355 --> 15:56.313
- I've never seen anything like it.
- I know. We've got another one.

15:56.314 --> 16:00.144
- She's got the same symptoms.
- It could be an allergy.

16:00.155 --> 16:01.773
What is going on out there?

16:01.774 --> 16:03.725
The Doctor's going to be here
in a sec.

16:03.726 --> 16:06.187
Have we found any
possible environmental causes?

16:06.188 --> 16:08.728
- Nothing at all, Doctor.
- They're getting worse.

16:08.729 --> 16:10.469
Stabilise her condition.

16:13.795 --> 16:16.135
Come on,
where are the dolphins?

16:24.800 --> 16:27.668
- Thanks, Mrs Smith. I'll check it out.
- OK.

16:37.115 --> 16:38.935
It's all new.

16:42.475 --> 16:45.375
Come on, Flipper.
Where are you?

17:58.155 --> 18:01.513
Jake, where are you...?

18:04.109 --> 18:06.329
I've never seen
anything like it before.

18:06.330 --> 18:08.670
It's like their immune systems
have gone berserk.

18:11.235 --> 18:14.215
- It is us. We've done this.
- Where's Jake?

18:14.275 --> 18:17.844
- Maybe there's another spell.
- We don't have time to start again.

18:21.035 --> 18:24.055
- What took you so long?
- I got it.

18:26.715 --> 18:28.895
Let's not get interrupted.

18:28.955 --> 18:32.215
This tablet belonged
to my sister, Alice.

18:32.275 --> 18:34.541
I've never actually used it.

18:35.345 --> 18:36.804
That's good.

18:37.555 --> 18:40.975
I mean, now we all have something
here from our families,

18:40.976 --> 18:43.436
so maybe it'll make
the spell stronger.

18:44.105 --> 18:47.495
- Let's hope so.
- Wow, are you being nice?

18:47.780 --> 18:49.295
It'll wear off.

18:49.897 --> 18:53.349
- What happens now?
- We all say why each thing is special.

18:53.350 --> 18:56.297
- Is that even a proper spell?
- Yes.

18:56.389 --> 18:58.371
Who wants to go first?

19:03.287 --> 19:05.427
My grandad died a long time ago,

19:05.428 --> 19:08.368
and this is the only photo
Mum has of him.

19:08.675 --> 19:12.535
When I was a boy, Mum used to tell
me about his adventures.

19:12.595 --> 19:14.975
He was like a Chinese Bear Grylls.

19:21.115 --> 19:23.575
This is my Mum's
favourite paintbrush.

19:23.635 --> 19:27.053
I thought about when I see her
and she's most happy.

19:27.086 --> 19:29.466
Most of the time
it's when she's painting.

19:29.675 --> 19:33.655
She gets this look on her face
like nothing can ever touch her.

19:36.275 --> 19:40.855
My Mum's crazy about gardening
and this is her favourite tool.

19:42.668 --> 19:45.408
She calls it
Sir Weed Killer.

19:47.515 --> 19:50.535
Especially after Oscar
had his accident,

19:51.058 --> 19:54.935
the only time she seemed happy
was when she was in the garden.

19:56.225 --> 19:59.983
I guess my Mum doesn't like dolphins
so much in this world.

20:00.395 --> 20:03.015
But I found this instead.

20:03.075 --> 20:06.842
My Mum got this brooch from my Dad
on their first date.

20:07.275 --> 20:11.335
They went to a footy match
and the Bandicoots won.

20:13.978 --> 20:16.559
My Dad's an idiot in our world,

20:17.694 --> 20:20.255
and this is the only
piece of evidence

20:20.283 --> 20:23.387
I have to show that
they ever cared for each other.

20:25.819 --> 20:28.679
OK, everybody hold hands.

20:35.315 --> 20:37.255
Nurse!

20:37.315 --> 20:40.855
Earth, Water, Air, Fire.

20:40.915 --> 20:43.775
Upon this tablet,
I invoke Thee.

20:43.835 --> 20:46.175
Your strength,
Your power to heal.

20:46.235 --> 20:48.815
While this tablet remains at hand,

20:48.875 --> 20:52.015
our mothers shall be safe
throughout this land.

20:55.724 --> 20:58.744
Felix! Felix!
He's fainting.

21:00.755 --> 21:03.535
- What's going on?
- Doctor! Doctor, quickly!

21:03.536 --> 21:05.578
What's going on?

21:09.389 --> 21:12.169
Mrs Ferne, are you OK?
Can you hear me?

21:42.869 --> 21:46.094
- Hey man.
- Great.

21:46.095 --> 21:49.775
- How're you feeling, magic dude?
- Like a truck ran me over.

21:49.835 --> 21:51.735
You were awesome.

21:58.044 --> 22:00.535
I heard what happened.
Is she alright?

22:01.474 --> 22:03.688
- I don't know.
- Mr. Bates.

22:06.355 --> 22:07.895
How is she?

22:07.907 --> 22:10.089
We don't know what happened,
but she's stabilised

22:10.090 --> 22:12.275
and it looks like
she's gonna be fine.

22:14.379 --> 22:16.648
- Can I see her?
- Of course.

22:18.291 --> 22:20.376
Oh, just immediate family.

22:35.671 --> 22:38.051
Are you sure there's nothing
I can get you?

22:38.067 --> 22:41.486
Oh no, I just need to sleep.
Thanks.

22:41.586 --> 22:43.006
OK.

23:02.795 --> 23:04.935
Happy Mother's Day?

23:23.795 --> 23:25.335
Could it happen again?

23:25.395 --> 23:28.731
I think your Mums are safe
for now, thanks to you boys.

23:28.732 --> 23:31.672
But the demon will be back,
more powerful than before.

23:31.673 --> 23:35.384
Thanks for that. I definitely
won't be having any nightmares now.

23:40.595 --> 23:42.695
Anyone seen my diary?

23:43.915 --> 23:46.119
You mean your Book of Shadows?

23:46.650 --> 23:49.081
- Interesting reading.
- Give it back.

23:49.082 --> 23:51.662
Didn't you say that every spell
a witch ever casts

23:51.663 --> 23:53.440
can be found
in their Book of Shadows?

23:53.441 --> 23:55.381
Yeah, Felix, didn't you say that?

23:56.277 --> 24:00.438
- I didn't mean to do it.
- Didn't mean to do what, Felix?

24:00.439 --> 24:02.339
Hey, don't gang up on him.

24:03.033 --> 24:05.055
He saved the day, alright?

24:05.056 --> 24:07.978
After he put us in danger
in the first place.

24:09.075 --> 24:11.215
What? What happened?

24:11.216 --> 24:13.766
You know how we're here
because of a magical event?

24:13.767 --> 24:16.438
- Yeah.
- Felix is that event.

24:17.274 --> 24:19.103
What?

24:22.075 --> 24:25.615
I'm really, really sorry.

24:44.675 --> 24:46.855
<i>...Isolated on tropical islands.</i>

24:46.915 --> 24:49.895
<i>It is as beautiful
as it is dangerous.</i>

24:49.955 --> 24:52.575
<i>With an abundance
of natural predators,</i>

24:52.635 --> 24:56.415
<i>both land and sea,
and a severe monsoon season</i>

24:56.475 --> 24:58.975
<i>that brings with it
frequent cyclones.</i>

24:59.035 --> 25:02.495
<i>There is little question as to
why it has remained relatively...</i>

25:16.955 --> 25:19.575
<i>Brian, is everything OK?</i>

25:19.635 --> 25:22.316
Everything's fine, honey.
