00:09.840 --> 00:10.800
Why did you knock me out?

00:11.590 --> 00:12.800
I didn't knock you out.

But if those fellas
catch up to us,

Is that you

If he ever said that to you,
he was wrong to do so.

down. Speaking of--

07:54.050 --> 07:55.350
You upgraded your

where Stanley is.

this whole thing up.

08:37.930 --> 08:39.390
He can't be trusted.

08:53.700 --> 08:54.660
Come here.

08:54.700 --> 08:55.660
Arrgh.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.780
He's not gonna give up.

09:05.830 --> 09:06.830
Leslie.

09:09.380 --> 09:10.250
Phone.

09:10.710 --> 09:11.630
Now.

09:16.260 --> 09:17.180
[Tinny]
Hey. Where are you off to?

09:17.220 --> 09:18.720
We should do something.

09:18.760 --> 09:21.720
I'm just about to run to work.
Well, work related. I mean,

09:21.760 --> 09:24.730
not that you couldn't relate.
I mean, you will work again.

09:24.770 --> 09:25.850
You know,
just not this week.

09:25.890 --> 09:27.310
I'm suspended.
Not fired.

09:27.350 --> 09:28.310
Relax.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.310
[phone rings]

09:29.360 --> 09:30.480
- Jake.
- Des.

09:30.520 --> 09:32.280
I need you to look into
Charlie Archer.

09:32.320 --> 09:33.900
Find anything you can on him.

09:33.940 --> 09:35.360
Big Charlie? The biker?

09:35.400 --> 09:36.780
Yeah. He's shifted gears

09:36.820 --> 09:39.240
and now he's behind this
scamming in some call center.

09:39.280 --> 09:40.660
Just --
Get on it right away.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.160
Ah, Tinny!

09:42.200 --> 09:43.620
Did you really just
say that to me?

09:43.660 --> 09:45.710
I'm on it. Not Tinny.
The call center. Bye.

09:45.750 --> 09:46.670
A case?

09:46.710 --> 09:47.580
I'm in.

09:47.620 --> 09:48.580
I'm not really sure I feel

09:48.630 --> 09:50.130
comfortable.
Somehow I feel like

09:50.170 --> 09:51.420
this is gonna get me
into trouble.

09:51.460 --> 09:54.050
If I don't do something,
I'm gonna lose my mind.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.220
Fine. But--

09:56.260 --> 09:58.840
if Jake catches us,
I don't know you.

09:59.260 --> 10:00.260
Okay.

10:02.180 --> 10:04.350
[phone rings]

10:09.480 --> 10:11.360
[Stanley] So-- Who's Leslie?

10:12.320 --> 10:13.900
Girlfriend? Wife?

10:15.490 --> 10:18.780
I noticed a lot of calls from
her. If you want my advice--

10:18.820 --> 10:19.820
I don't.

10:21.330 --> 10:22.660
You should talk more.

10:22.700 --> 10:25.250
Most of your calls only lasted
a couple of minutes.

10:25.290 --> 10:26.660
And all those texts.

10:27.290 --> 10:28.370
So impersonal.

10:28.420 --> 10:29.710
Oh my God.

10:29.750 --> 10:31.670
Seriously. I mean, if she means
something to you,

10:31.710 --> 10:33.050
you gotta work for it.

10:33.090 --> 10:34.170
We're both busy.

10:34.210 --> 10:35.420
Okay? She's a cop.
And I got my own--

10:35.460 --> 10:36.720
A cop?

10:36.760 --> 10:40.300
Wait, wait, wait.
We're so not talking about this.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.220
Even still--
You're lucky.

10:42.260 --> 10:44.770
All these years,
I never met the right one.

10:44.810 --> 10:44.850
Buddy, I'm not your therapist.

10:46.390 --> 10:47.890
I didn't take this gig to sit
here and listen to you.

10:49.270 --> 10:50.600
Maybe someday, when I'm
cleared of all charges.

10:52.020 --> 10:54.320
You took a deal to testify
against Charlie Archer.

10:54.360 --> 10:55.610
And then you ran away with
a boat load of money.

10:56.940 --> 10:57.360
You're guilty. You might
as well deal with that.

10:58.950 --> 11:01.030
You think whatever you want.
All I ever did was work for him.

11:01.990 --> 11:03.240
So what did you do,
anyway?

11:03.280 --> 11:04.740
He paid me to write
a few lines of code.

11:06.040 --> 11:09.460
It optimizes the credit card
charging process.

11:09.500 --> 11:11.040
You mean, optimize the best way

11:11.080 --> 11:12.580
to rip a bunch of
innocent people off.

11:12.630 --> 11:14.170
No. I was always clean.

11:14.210 --> 11:18.630
But can the script be used
to automatically

11:18.670 --> 11:20.550
make extra charges
on the customer's

11:20.590 --> 11:20.630
credit card? Yes.

11:22.260 --> 11:24.720
So do you actually have any
real evidence against this guy

11:24.760 --> 11:26.390
or is it just your word
against his?

11:26.430 --> 11:27.600
Oh, I've got evidence.

11:27.640 --> 11:28.770
I can tell you that.

11:30.020 --> 11:32.020
I can also tell you
if we don't stop soon,

11:32.060 --> 11:33.310
we're gonna have a problem.

11:33.810 --> 11:34.900
Excuse me.

11:35.730 --> 11:36.690
Oh my...

11:37.730 --> 11:39.490
Oh, you're disgusting.

11:41.950 --> 11:42.860
[Tinny] Place is totally shut down.

11:42.910 --> 11:44.200
Oh, no that's okay.

11:44.240 --> 11:45.200
There's still some computer
equipment left here

11:45.240 --> 11:46.490
that I can access.

11:46.530 --> 11:48.910
See, if I can find some traces
of some old code,

11:48.950 --> 11:50.460
I might be able to see what
Stanley was up to.

11:50.500 --> 11:52.920
You look really amazing,
by the way.

11:52.960 --> 11:55.790
The suspension.
It really suits you.

11:55.840 --> 11:56.800
Thanks Dezzy.

11:56.840 --> 11:58.260
You're looking pretty fit
yourself.

11:58.300 --> 11:59.210
Yeah?

11:59.260 --> 12:01.260
So how's Grayson doing--

12:02.260 --> 12:03.220
By the way.

12:03.260 --> 12:04.680
He's planning a trip--

12:04.720 --> 12:06.100
for us to meet his folks.

12:06.140 --> 12:08.020
I think it's too soon, though.
What do you think?

12:08.060 --> 12:09.850
Oh, well, I think that--

12:09.890 --> 12:10.850
[sound of door]

12:10.890 --> 12:11.810
Someone's coming.

12:11.850 --> 12:12.770
Don't worry.
I got this.

12:12.810 --> 12:13.850
Okay, but remember --

12:13.900 --> 12:15.360
discretion.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.440
Excuse me, Sir.
Can I have a word or two?

12:17.480 --> 12:18.940
[whispering]
Oh Tinny. Not the badge.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.150
[phone rings]

12:22.070 --> 12:23.070
Hello?

12:23.110 --> 12:24.110
What have you
found out on House?

12:24.160 --> 12:25.410
Ah, not much. Almost zero.

12:25.450 --> 12:26.280
What have you been doing?

12:26.320 --> 12:27.700
Jake needed me to do a thing.

12:27.740 --> 12:29.950
Oh, well if Jake needed you to
do something, then --

12:30.000 --> 12:31.200
Yeah, I knew you'd understand.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.410
No, I don't understand!

12:32.460 --> 12:33.750
What did you find out on House?

12:33.790 --> 12:35.250
Okay. Details are scanty.

12:35.290 --> 12:37.340
But I did learn that House
brought charges

12:37.380 --> 12:39.170
against Big Charlie four times.

12:39.210 --> 12:40.300
How did those cases go?

12:40.340 --> 12:41.090
All mistrials.

12:41.130 --> 12:42.220
Odd.

12:42.260 --> 12:44.260
Keep looking into House.
I'll be in touch.

12:44.300 --> 12:45.260
Okay.

12:48.180 --> 12:49.140
I wonder where Jake is.

12:51.100 --> 12:52.020
Yeah.

12:52.060 --> 12:53.640
Crown Prosecutor Marie House

12:53.690 --> 12:56.310
wants Stanley returned
to Corner Brook.

12:56.350 --> 12:57.440
Something about new charges.

12:57.480 --> 12:59.020
We think she wants
to rig the case.

12:59.070 --> 13:00.650
She has a history
of mistrials with

13:00.690 --> 13:01.650
old Charlie.

13:01.690 --> 13:02.990
[Jake] She's not the only one.

13:03.030 --> 13:04.240
Big Charlie is after him too.
I'm telling you.

13:05.070 --> 13:06.410
There's more going on here

13:06.450 --> 13:08.700
than this whole thing
about Stanley testifying.

13:08.740 --> 13:09.990
[Rose] Where are you at now?

13:10.030 --> 13:11.750
[Jake] I'm at Goobies.
And I'm almost home.

13:11.790 --> 13:12.700
Which is good.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.500
Because aside from you, Dad,

13:14.540 --> 13:16.580
this fella Stanley is one of the
most annoying people

13:16.630 --> 13:18.040
I've ever met in my entire life.

13:18.080 --> 13:19.710
[Mal] Conduct yourself accordingly.

13:19.750 --> 13:20.880
Tinny does not need to see

13:20.920 --> 13:22.670
any more of this
kind of behavior from you.

13:22.710 --> 13:23.840
So that's what this is about.

13:25.380 --> 13:28.590
Tinny being suspended. Look.
This is your fault. Alright?

13:28.640 --> 13:31.310
You're the patriarch.
This crap flows from the top.

13:31.350 --> 13:32.600
I'm not the one
who can't get someone

13:32.640 --> 13:34.100
from point A
to point frickin' B.

13:34.140 --> 13:36.270
Oh, I can get him there
You wanna make a bet?

13:36.310 --> 13:37.810
I'll bet you the full commission

13:37.850 --> 13:40.070
you can't get him to the
police station by end of day.

13:40.110 --> 13:41.020
Mal!

13:41.070 --> 13:42.570
[Jake]
Ten thousand bucks?

13:42.610 --> 13:44.400
Easy money for me, old man.

13:45.860 --> 13:47.240
- Is that Jake?
- Yup.

13:47.280 --> 13:48.200
Jake?

13:48.240 --> 13:48.740
Stanley!

13:49.450 --> 13:50.450
Where you running to?

13:50.490 --> 13:52.200
You gotta stop running away
from me.

13:52.240 --> 13:55.540
We've been through this before,
like, twenty minutes ago.

13:55.580 --> 13:59.210
All this crazy driving.
I get disoriented.

13:59.250 --> 14:01.340
And I don't have my motion
sickness pills.

14:01.380 --> 14:03.800
Right. Turns out you're a very
popular guy.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.470
You're wanted
in Corner Brook now.

14:05.510 --> 14:07.090
A whole slew of new charges.

14:07.130 --> 14:09.140
Oh, not me.
That's all Big Charlie.

14:09.180 --> 14:10.470
Right.
Well, I don't care.

14:10.510 --> 14:12.680
Because our destination
is St. John's.

14:12.720 --> 14:14.680
That's where my payday is.
Whether you like it or not.

14:14.720 --> 14:15.890
[Stanley]
Final warning.

14:15.930 --> 14:18.520
I do get extreme bouts
of motion sickness.

14:20.190 --> 14:23.690
Oh my God. You're like dealing
with a six year old. Come here.

14:23.730 --> 14:24.740
Give me your arm.

14:27.780 --> 14:29.450
Is this really necessary?

14:29.490 --> 14:31.580
Ah, yes.
It is necessary.

14:32.410 --> 14:33.660
Because I don't trust you.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.340
May cause drowsiness. Good.

14:51.300 --> 14:52.260
Come on.

14:56.560 --> 14:59.100
Odd of your old man to
gamble with you like this.

15:00.440 --> 15:02.730
A father is supposed to instill
a moral compass.

15:04.020 --> 15:06.820
So I suppose your old man
was perfect, was he?

15:06.860 --> 15:07.940
Pretty close.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.200
Until my mom died.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.240
I was only nine.

15:13.240 --> 15:14.280
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.660
My mother died
when I was young too.

15:16.200 --> 15:16.410
It's okay.

15:17.910 --> 15:21.170
He ended up turning to the
bottle for a bit of comfort.

15:22.750 --> 15:27.550
I couldn't blame him for that.
Likely why I never had kids.

15:29.170 --> 15:33.850
So is this Leslie someone that
you see bearing children with?

15:35.310 --> 15:36.560
Would you just take those pills.

15:36.600 --> 15:38.520
In fact, take all of them,
if you can, now.

15:38.560 --> 15:40.350
But these make you sleepy.

15:40.390 --> 15:42.190
You could have gotten
the daytime ones, you know.

15:42.770 --> 15:43.860
Yeah. I know.

15:49.400 --> 15:49.440
What is going on?

15:50.900 --> 15:53.990
[Stanley] How ironic. We
where just at a gas station.

15:55.700 --> 15:56.660
Breathe on me.

15:57.160 --> 15:58.200
Excuse me?

15:58.240 --> 16:00.120
Oh my God.
You reek of gas!

16:00.160 --> 16:03.000
What the hell? Did you siphon
all the gas out of my car?

16:03.040 --> 16:04.420
I'm sorry.
I can't go to St. John's.

16:05.670 --> 16:07.920
I think it's time that we
got out of the car

16:07.960 --> 16:09.630
and you got
a little bit of exercise.

16:13.180 --> 16:14.510
You think House has given up?

16:14.550 --> 16:15.470
Doubt it.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.480
Clever.

16:21.350 --> 16:22.520
House heard everything.

16:28.230 --> 16:31.190
A little help would be great.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.650
No, no.
You gotta work up a sweat.

16:32.700 --> 16:35.410
Get all the gasoline
out of your pores.

16:35.450 --> 16:36.620
[phone rings]

16:36.660 --> 16:38.410
Sorry.
I gotta take this.

16:39.740 --> 16:40.870
Don't worry.

16:40.910 --> 16:42.710
I'm headed back to town
at a full clip.

16:42.750 --> 16:44.040
House knows your location.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.540
She might be sending someone
after you.

16:45.580 --> 16:48.170
Doesn't matter, okay. I am
definitely gonna win this bet.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.050
Hang on for a second.

16:50.090 --> 16:51.210
[Stanley]
This looks bad.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.550
[Jake]
Toby Quinton.

16:52.590 --> 16:54.390
We went to
the Police Academy together.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.470
Dear God.
You were a cop?

17:05.440 --> 17:06.360
What are you doing?

17:06.400 --> 17:07.270
Get in.

17:09.980 --> 17:11.030
Toby Quinton?

17:11.570 --> 17:11.940
Jake! What?

17:12.990 --> 17:14.450
How are you?
What are you doing?

17:14.490 --> 17:16.450
Look. Not a lot of time to talk.
See that guy right there?

17:17.160 --> 17:18.410
He's coming for you.

17:18.450 --> 17:19.660
He wants Stanley.

17:19.700 --> 17:21.200
I don't have him, Jake. You do.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.450
He's in your car, you idiot.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.460
He's in my car?

17:24.580 --> 17:25.580
Hey b'ys!
How are you doing?

17:26.420 --> 17:27.960
That is Big Charlie Archer.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.170
He is very dangerous. You gotta
take him down. Listen to me.

17:31.210 --> 17:32.710
I'll get Stanley to safety.
Go! Now!

17:32.760 --> 17:34.880
Jake! I can't. I don't even know
what you're talking about.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.300
Jake?
We need to talk.

17:36.340 --> 17:37.390
Give me your keys. Quick.

17:37.430 --> 17:38.930
I'll get Stanley away. Go! Go!

17:38.970 --> 17:41.060
Ah, sir. I'm gonna ask you to
step back, now. Please --

17:41.100 --> 17:42.560
I just need to talk to Jake.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.020
You gotta do something.
Do something! Give me the keys.

17:44.060 --> 17:45.230
Shut up!

17:45.270 --> 17:46.560
I am an officer
of the friggin’ court!

17:46.600 --> 17:47.690
Do not push me.

17:47.730 --> 17:48.730
Quick. Keys!

17:51.400 --> 17:53.360
Alright.
Down on your knees. Now!

17:54.400 --> 17:55.320
Please.
Before someone gets hurt.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.780
I just need to talk to Jake.

18:03.410 --> 18:05.120
[Stanley] That wasn't nice
what you did to that sheriff.

18:05.160 --> 18:06.460
You confused him.

18:06.500 --> 18:07.670
Yeah--
Well he's easily confused.

18:07.710 --> 18:09.750
And trust me,
he's not such an angel. OK.

18:09.790 --> 18:11.040
He was the biggest bully in our
class at the Academy.

18:12.550 --> 18:14.010
If I was you, I'd take a look
in the mirror about that.

18:15.170 --> 18:15.300
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

18:16.680 --> 18:19.760
You might see a little bully
staring back at you.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.010
That's what it means.

18:22.600 --> 18:26.600
Look at this.
A standard sheriff dash camera.

18:28.560 --> 18:29.650
Is it recording?

18:31.650 --> 18:32.480
Not anymore.

18:33.110 --> 18:34.570
So destructive.

18:34.610 --> 18:36.070
[phone rings]

18:36.490 --> 18:37.860
Excuse me.

18:37.900 --> 18:40.530
Dad. You were right.
House sent a sheriff after us.

18:40.570 --> 18:41.910
But we gave him the slip.

18:41.950 --> 18:43.660
- Good.
- By stealing his car.

18:43.700 --> 18:44.830
Not so good.

18:44.870 --> 18:46.370
The pressure of this bet
is getting to you.

18:46.410 --> 18:47.120
The sheriff was Toby Quinton.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.710
Quinton?

18:48.750 --> 18:52.500
That the guy that flunked the
RNC Cadet Program three times?

18:52.540 --> 18:54.710
And I was there for the last go
around. He hates my guts.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.590
I wonder why.

18:56.630 --> 18:58.340
The point is,
he's not gonna report it

18:58.380 --> 19:00.050
because it will make him
look stupid.

19:00.090 --> 19:02.100
House says it's to make sure
he gets convicted.

19:02.140 --> 19:03.890
But to send a sheriff
after you?

19:03.930 --> 19:05.810
You mentioned-She was a part
of some other trial

19:05.850 --> 19:07.310
involving Big Charlie, right.

19:07.350 --> 19:09.640
Maybe she's being paid
to throw the trial.

19:09.690 --> 19:12.560
There's something more going on
here. Just keep me posted.

19:12.610 --> 19:14.190
Will do.
Oh, and Son.

19:14.690 --> 19:15.570
Tick tock.

19:16.570 --> 19:19.400
He is unnecessarily hard on you.

19:20.240 --> 19:21.490
Do you have an off switch?

19:22.740 --> 19:23.700
Let's go.

19:24.200 --> 19:25.030
Mal.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.540
You’re not going anywhere.

19:26.580 --> 19:29.250
House is charging you both with
obstruction of justice.

19:30.250 --> 19:31.250
I'm sorry.

19:31.290 --> 19:32.380
You're under arrest.

19:34.250 --> 19:34.920
[Tinny] What are you doing, anyway?

19:34.960 --> 19:36.380
I found the bank account

19:36.420 --> 19:38.300
where the extra credit card
charges are being sent to.

19:38.340 --> 19:40.840
Now, it's just a matter of
finding which bank.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.350
And running a code tracker to
get the PIN. And then --

19:43.970 --> 19:45.050
Bob's your uncle.

19:45.100 --> 19:47.310
I gotta say.
That's pretty impressive.

19:47.350 --> 19:48.890
Ah, yeah. Very funny.

19:48.930 --> 19:51.770
No. I'm serious, Des.
You do a good job.

19:52.230 --> 19:53.110
Really?

19:54.860 --> 19:56.440
Wow. I'm so used to your--

19:56.480 --> 19:57.860
sarcasm.
You're compliments.

19:57.900 --> 19:58.990
They feel unnatural.

19:59.030 --> 20:01.240
Really. I mean--
You're talented.

20:02.570 --> 20:06.700
I'm lucky -- We're all
lucky to have you around.

20:06.740 --> 20:09.250
And I'm starting to see that
more and more.

20:09.290 --> 20:10.830
[phone rings]

20:10.870 --> 20:11.870
Thank you.

20:13.290 --> 20:14.210
[ring]

20:14.250 --> 20:15.420
Aren't you gonna get that?

20:16.290 --> 20:18.050
Nah. It's just Grayson.

20:18.090 --> 20:19.130
He'll call back.

20:19.670 --> 20:20.720
[computer sound]

20:20.760 --> 20:23.800
- Isn't that it?
- Huh? Yes. Oh, uh. Yes.

20:23.840 --> 20:26.510
And now to use the PIN
to open the account.

20:27.390 --> 20:28.430
It's empty.

20:28.470 --> 20:29.890
Are you sure
it's the right account?

20:29.930 --> 20:32.520
Yeah. The money was deposited.
One point five million.

20:32.560 --> 20:33.810
But it's since been withdrawn.

20:33.850 --> 20:35.190
We need to find out
who withdrew it.

20:38.860 --> 20:39.820
Port Aux Basques?

20:39.860 --> 20:41.610
That's in
the opposite direction.

20:41.650 --> 20:43.280
So we're not going
to St. John's?

20:43.320 --> 20:44.660
Oh, buddy.
We're going to town.

20:44.700 --> 20:46.030
But Quinton doesn't need
to know that.

20:46.070 --> 20:47.700
So you want the sheriff to find
the information.

20:49.160 --> 20:51.960
You're a smart guy. Did you
learn that from your dad?

20:52.000 --> 20:53.290
He can't be all bad.

20:53.330 --> 20:54.170
He's not that bad.

20:54.210 --> 20:55.290
I can see that.

20:55.330 --> 20:56.960
I've been working
with my dad a long time.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.380
I've learned
a lot from him.

20:58.420 --> 21:01.090
Wait, wait. How do you keep
doing this to me?

21:01.130 --> 21:02.050
We're not talking about this.

21:03.420 --> 21:05.720
It sounds like he did okay,
for a single parent.

21:07.220 --> 21:08.550
[Jake]
That motorcycle.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.930
That's from one of the
Chevaliers. That means that

21:10.970 --> 21:12.640
Charlie's got the Chevaliers
after us.

21:13.060 --> 21:14.190
Come on.

21:14.230 --> 21:16.350
Motorcycles are death on wheels.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.270
No way.
I'd draw the line here.

21:20.230 --> 21:21.280
You look very manly.

21:21.320 --> 21:22.360
Now get on.

21:25.240 --> 21:26.200
[sound of bike starting up]

21:26.870 --> 21:27.910
What?

21:29.620 --> 21:30.740
The hell!

21:32.540 --> 21:36.170
Hey. It's me.
Don't be mad. But-

21:36.830 --> 21:38.290
I lost them. But--

21:38.330 --> 21:39.420
I got it under control.

21:39.460 --> 21:41.000
You are an idiot Quinton.

21:41.050 --> 21:41.960
You really are.

21:44.050 --> 21:45.680
[screaming]
Don't call me that!

21:50.430 --> 21:51.510
I need that phone.

21:51.560 --> 21:52.560
Malachy Doyle.

21:52.600 --> 21:53.770
You give me Stanley Westcott.

21:53.810 --> 21:55.690
And I will drop the
obstruction charges.

21:55.730 --> 21:56.850
I wish I could help you.

21:59.150 --> 22:00.060
What are you doing?

22:00.110 --> 22:01.270
You're under a lot of stress.

22:02.030 --> 22:03.070
I get that.

22:03.110 --> 22:04.900
This hasn't been easy
for any of us.

22:07.490 --> 22:10.490
You need a hug.
Come on. Come on.

22:10.530 --> 22:11.990
There you go.
That's it.

22:12.030 --> 22:14.660
Yeah. All right. See?
Isn't that better?

22:14.700 --> 22:15.910
Um.

22:17.290 --> 22:18.210
Yeah.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.420
But I believe
I've made my point.

22:22.460 --> 22:22.840
Uh.

22:23.880 --> 22:26.170
Give me Westcott.
And you can go.

22:30.340 --> 22:31.890
Gotta say.
That was pretty hot.

22:31.930 --> 22:34.730
You think that was hot?
Check this out.

22:36.350 --> 22:40.230
All of this forced air isn't
good for my sensitive duodenum.

22:41.310 --> 22:43.440
Do not throw up on my back,
Stanley.

22:43.480 --> 22:45.320
I can't help it.
It's coming up.

22:48.150 --> 22:49.240
[Jake]
Hang on.

22:51.660 --> 22:52.870
[Stanley]
It's coming.

22:54.410 --> 22:55.580
It's coming!

22:56.410 --> 22:57.410
Get away from me.

22:57.460 --> 22:59.170
[phone rings]

23:02.290 --> 23:03.790
Yeah. What's happening?

23:03.840 --> 23:06.550
Well, first off House wants to
charge us with obstruction.

23:06.590 --> 23:08.010
Now I see where Tinny gets it.
From you.

23:08.050 --> 23:09.550
Shut it.

23:09.590 --> 23:13.390
We have something on House.
Seems she's had several email

23:13.430 --> 23:15.260
money transfers in the past
number of weeks.

23:15.310 --> 23:16.850
They're all for the same amount.
Eleven hundred dollars. And --

23:18.310 --> 23:20.350
It looks like they're
going into a business account.

23:20.390 --> 23:22.730
You think that Big Charlie has
been paying off House?

23:22.770 --> 23:24.570
[Mal] We're not sure.
But it seems strange

23:24.610 --> 23:26.360
that she's putting it
into a business account.

23:26.400 --> 23:27.190
Not some untraceable one.

23:28.650 --> 23:31.070
But it does explain why House
wants Stanley so bad.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.820
Big Charlie is paying House
to pin this all on Stanley.

23:33.870 --> 23:35.200
You're definitely
on to something, okay.

23:35.240 --> 23:36.120
So just stay on House.

23:36.160 --> 23:37.330
[Mal] Will do.

23:37.370 --> 23:39.290
In the meantime, son.
I know this wager

23:39.330 --> 23:41.460
is taking its toll on you.
You're off your game.

23:41.500 --> 23:43.880
There's no shame in backing out
right now,

23:43.920 --> 23:45.040
well, a little shame.

23:45.090 --> 23:47.090
But you're used to that.

23:47.130 --> 23:49.720
Not a chance, old man. Okay.
I am nearly home free.

23:49.760 --> 23:50.880
[explosion]

23:52.760 --> 23:53.680
Stanley.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.100
Did you see that?

24:02.020 --> 24:03.350
Why did you do this?

24:03.400 --> 24:05.690
I told you Jake.
I'm not going to St. John's.

24:06.520 --> 24:07.860
[Jake]
That motorcycle

24:07.900 --> 24:09.490
was owned by those bikers, okay.

24:10.570 --> 24:12.200
When they get
over here, they're--

24:13.450 --> 24:14.570
Son of a bitch!

24:15.780 --> 24:16.740
Arrgh!

24:19.290 --> 24:20.870
[Mal] We need to find out
what House is doing.

24:20.910 --> 24:22.170
And I think I know how.

24:22.870 --> 24:23.870
[Hood]
Sorry guys.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.840
I need to take you
to get processed.

24:25.880 --> 24:26.460
Hood.

24:27.460 --> 24:29.760
Daniel.
We need to see Leslie.

24:30.300 --> 24:31.170
Now.

24:34.970 --> 24:36.430
Don't you think a motorcycle

24:36.470 --> 24:37.930
woulda come in handy
right about now?

24:37.970 --> 24:40.270
I told you I get motion
sickness!

24:40.310 --> 24:42.770
But I see your point.
And I got a bad knee.

24:42.810 --> 24:44.230
Not so fast.

24:44.270 --> 24:45.150
[Jake]
Come on!

24:47.650 --> 24:48.570
Gimme that!

24:49.400 --> 24:50.610
[Stanley]
Do something!

24:51.690 --> 24:52.650
That's your plan?

24:52.700 --> 24:54.450
You're gonna call in
air support?

24:54.490 --> 24:55.820
Something like that.

24:55.870 --> 24:57.740
[sound of flare sizzling]

24:59.200 --> 25:00.160
Here we go!

25:01.540 --> 25:02.830
[explosion]

25:03.920 --> 25:04.920
[Stanley]
That's it!

25:04.960 --> 25:06.880
I'm proud of you son.

25:06.920 --> 25:07.790
Feels good, doesn't it?

25:07.840 --> 25:09.380
Come on.

25:09.420 --> 25:13.550
You know, if I had a son, Jake,
I'd like him to be like you.

25:15.050 --> 25:17.090
[Tinny] OK, I was able to
get the bank manager

25:17.140 --> 25:18.050
to go through
the security footage

25:18.100 --> 25:19.180
to see who withdrew the money.

25:19.220 --> 25:20.560
They're sending the
image over now.

25:20.600 --> 25:22.810
Wow. You must have
been pretty persuasive.

25:22.850 --> 25:24.100
They never do that. Tinny!

25:24.140 --> 25:26.150
You used your badge again.
You can't be at it.

25:26.190 --> 25:28.360
It's okay.
Don't worry about me.

25:28.400 --> 25:30.820
And--maybe--

25:32.070 --> 25:33.070
the badge doesn't fit.

25:33.700 --> 25:34.530
What?

25:34.990 --> 25:35.990
I mean,

25:36.030 --> 25:37.570
it's in my blood
to be a P.I. right?

25:38.320 --> 25:39.490
And we make a good team.

25:39.530 --> 25:40.490
[computer sound]

25:40.530 --> 25:43.000
Oh. Ah! There it is.
There it is.

25:45.620 --> 25:46.670
It's Stanley Westcott.

25:47.330 --> 25:48.540
I gotta call Jake.

25:52.250 --> 25:53.590
[answer machine] Yes,
Jake leave a message.

25:53.630 --> 25:56.050
Jake! Jake! Stanley took
the money. I miss you.

25:57.090 --> 25:58.140
Whew!

25:59.800 --> 26:02.020
You need
a better service provider.

26:06.850 --> 26:08.610
I meant what I said.

26:09.770 --> 26:11.650
I wish I had a son.

26:14.150 --> 26:16.780
You know, all this brings out
a lot of regrets.

26:16.820 --> 26:19.700
Why do I feel some big, you
know, confession coming on?

26:19.740 --> 26:22.910
I have regrets, Jake.
In my personal life.

26:22.950 --> 26:26.620
But I'm innocent of these
charges that are against me.

26:27.670 --> 26:29.500
I don't care.
And you know what?

26:29.540 --> 26:30.790
I know there's
an entire other reason

26:30.830 --> 26:32.710
why you were trying to
get away from me.

26:33.380 --> 26:34.300
Here we go--

26:34.340 --> 26:35.760
Arrgh. It's Big Charlie.

26:37.430 --> 26:38.470
Just--

26:44.970 --> 26:48.390
Charlie. Good news. I found your
guy. But he's a bit of a runner.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.400
[Charlie]
Get him Tank.

26:50.150 --> 26:51.560
Very disappointed, Jake,

26:51.610 --> 26:53.020
that you didn't take my advice.

26:53.070 --> 26:55.070
You'd be surprised at how often
I hear that.

26:55.110 --> 26:56.990
Well, you know,
I admire your determination.

26:57.030 --> 26:58.490
So here's what I'm gonna do--

26:58.530 --> 27:01.990
I'm gonna give you fifteen
thousand dollars to walk away.

27:02.030 --> 27:03.660
That's five thousand
dollars more

27:03.700 --> 27:05.580
than you stand to make
turning Stanley in.

27:05.620 --> 27:08.460
Something tells me you're just
not gonna take no for an answer.

27:08.500 --> 27:09.670
Let me get the cash.

27:12.840 --> 27:13.800
[punch]

27:14.250 --> 27:15.130
[punch]

27:16.630 --> 27:17.720
There you go.

27:18.340 --> 27:19.300
Watch yourself.

27:22.470 --> 27:23.760
[Charlie]
Tank!

27:23.800 --> 27:25.140
Tank! Your boss! He's in the
car. He's gonna die.

27:25.180 --> 27:25.810
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

27:25.850 --> 27:27.430
[Stanley]
What now?

27:27.470 --> 27:29.140
[Jake] Stanley buddy. It' look
like our luck has just changed.

27:29.190 --> 27:30.100
Come on!

27:30.140 --> 27:31.520
This is crazy!

27:39.610 --> 27:41.740
Well Jake.
This is where you get off.

27:41.780 --> 27:43.780
Or don't get on, as it were.

27:44.700 --> 27:46.080
Great father you'd be.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.120
Whoa!

28:11.350 --> 28:13.690
[tires screech]

28:19.070 --> 28:21.450
Stanley, I tell ya. If we get
out of this alive

28:21.490 --> 28:22.660
I'm gonna end up
killing you myself.

28:23.820 --> 28:25.160
Where are we?
Why did you knock me out?

28:26.740 --> 28:29.410
I didn't knock you out. But if
those fellas catch up to us,

28:29.450 --> 28:31.040
they're gonna knock us
both out for good.

28:34.290 --> 28:36.500
You're a dead man Doyle.

28:39.710 --> 28:40.670
You gotta be kidding me.

28:40.710 --> 28:43.010
Music.
It helps me think.

28:43.050 --> 28:44.800
If you touch that again,
I'll cut your paws off.

28:45.890 --> 28:47.800
Is that you
or your father speaking?

28:47.850 --> 28:51.480
If he ever said that to you,
he was wrong to do so.

28:54.440 --> 28:56.230
Game over, Jake.

28:57.570 --> 28:58.820
This looks fatal.

28:58.860 --> 29:00.150
Just saying.

29:03.030 --> 29:04.530
Jake. Jake!

29:04.990 --> 29:05.950
Jake!

29:07.660 --> 29:08.540
[crash]

29:28.180 --> 29:29.560
So this bet with Jake.

29:29.600 --> 29:30.850
You're really
sticking it to him.

29:30.890 --> 29:32.100
You know it's just transference,

29:32.140 --> 29:33.690
he's not responsible
for Tinny's suspension.

29:35.060 --> 29:37.650
I know dear. But it's such
a great stress reliever.

29:38.820 --> 29:40.860
Ten thousand dollars
is a lot of money.

29:40.900 --> 29:43.360
You know Jake's the best.
He might just win the bet.

29:43.400 --> 29:44.570
I'm counting on it.

29:44.610 --> 29:46.070
Malachy Doyle.
Are you getting soft on me?

29:46.110 --> 29:47.410
He needs the money right now.

29:47.450 --> 29:48.870
I can't just give it to him.
He'd never take it.

29:48.910 --> 29:50.290
Hey, hey, hey. What's this?

29:53.540 --> 29:54.500
Survey.

29:56.920 --> 29:59.210
House commissioned an opinion
poll to see if

29:59.250 --> 30:01.050
she'd win her district
in a provincial election.

30:01.840 --> 30:03.210
She's running for office?

30:06.550 --> 30:08.050
Is the P.I. business that bad?

30:10.220 --> 30:13.600
[Jake] Okay, look. For the last
time. You knocked yourself out.

30:14.310 --> 30:14.890
I wouldn't hit you.

30:15.640 --> 30:17.100
[phone message sound]

30:17.140 --> 30:18.440
[Des] Jake! Jake! Stanley
took the money. I miss you!

30:19.900 --> 30:21.610
[Jake] You did scam the
money from the call center.

30:21.650 --> 30:22.480
You lied to me.

30:23.610 --> 30:24.860
I didn't scam anyone
except Charlie.

30:26.320 --> 30:29.530
The code sent the stolen
client's money to his account.

30:29.570 --> 30:30.820
So what? You stole from him.

30:30.870 --> 30:34.040
My plan was to return it
and testify against him.

30:34.080 --> 30:37.620
I told the Crown I had solid
evidence against Big Charlie

30:37.670 --> 30:38.870
for all of it.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.250
But you don't have any evidence?
Another lie.

30:41.290 --> 30:42.840
I manufactured evidence.

30:42.880 --> 30:45.130
But his lawyer will
blast holes through it.

30:45.170 --> 30:47.800
And once the Crown finds out
I don't have proof,

30:47.840 --> 30:49.090
Big Charlie will walk.

30:49.130 --> 30:51.260
And I'll go to jail for a crime
I didn't commit.

30:51.300 --> 30:55.100
You know what? None of this is
my problem anyways. Okay?

30:55.140 --> 30:59.520
All I gotta do,
is just get you to St. John's.

31:04.070 --> 31:05.780
[Stanley]
You okay, Buddy?

31:06.990 --> 31:08.110
[Jake] Just a little drowsy

31:10.070 --> 31:10.660
Did you drug me?

31:11.700 --> 31:15.370
I told you
to get the daytime ones.

31:23.090 --> 31:25.460
[Des]
A month ago, Stanley Westcott

31:25.500 --> 31:27.340
withdrew the bilked money from
a bank in Bay Roberts.

31:27.380 --> 31:28.590
And then was picked up

31:28.630 --> 31:31.550
an hour and fifteen minutes
later at Goobies.

31:31.590 --> 31:33.300
The police never found
the money on him,

31:33.350 --> 31:34.680
which means he stashed it
somewhere in between.

31:34.720 --> 31:36.180
True.

31:36.220 --> 31:39.520
But, he wasn't planning on
getting caught. So chances are--

31:40.770 --> 31:42.810
he hid the money
before the cops grabbed him.

31:42.850 --> 31:44.520
Which means the money is
somewhere in Goobies.

31:44.560 --> 31:46.400
I'm gonna text Jake
and let him know.

31:47.940 --> 31:49.950
So. You're still alive.

31:49.990 --> 31:52.110
Yeah. I was just helping Des
with something.

31:52.160 --> 31:52.990
I was able to

31:53.030 --> 31:54.570
switch some shifts around.

31:54.620 --> 31:57.500
And now I'm off tomorrow. Which
means we can leave tonight.

31:58.700 --> 32:00.000
As long as there's nothing
stopping you.

32:00.040 --> 32:00.920
No.

32:01.710 --> 32:02.630
unless--

32:02.670 --> 32:03.790
you need me.

32:03.830 --> 32:06.130
Naw. We've done all we can now.

32:06.170 --> 32:06.800
It's up to Jake.

32:06.840 --> 32:08.050
Great.

32:08.090 --> 32:10.220
Well, I'll pick you up
at your place in an hour

32:11.010 --> 32:11.930
Bye.

32:13.760 --> 32:14.640
Great.

32:21.140 --> 32:22.730
What are you doing?

32:22.770 --> 32:26.190
Jake, I'm truly sorry. I really
wish I could let you take me in.

32:26.230 --> 32:27.030
And get that money.

32:27.900 --> 32:29.900
Hey! Hey! Hey! Take it easy.

32:32.570 --> 32:33.870
Told you he was trouble.

32:37.370 --> 32:39.330
[phone rings]

32:43.670 --> 32:44.670
[slurring]
Leslie.

32:44.710 --> 32:46.080
Jake. Are you okay?

32:46.130 --> 32:48.420
It kinda feels like you've been
avoiding me all day.

32:48.460 --> 32:48.880
No, I'm good.

32:49.960 --> 32:53.010
You know what?
I really love...you.

32:53.050 --> 32:53.930
I love you.

32:55.220 --> 32:56.720
Ah, Jake?

33:04.350 --> 33:05.100
[knocking]

33:06.020 --> 33:07.320
Looks like it's my lucky day.

33:08.230 --> 33:09.400
Quinton?

33:09.440 --> 33:10.860
You had me headed out
to Port aux Basques.

33:10.900 --> 33:12.860
It's beautiful there
this time of year.

33:12.900 --> 33:13.820
No it's not.

33:13.860 --> 33:14.740
You wanna get out of the car?

33:19.330 --> 33:20.240
Idiot.

33:24.620 --> 33:25.540
I was--

33:27.590 --> 33:28.380
I was drugged.

33:28.420 --> 33:29.840
Gotta tell you, Jake.

33:29.880 --> 33:31.760
I've been dreaming about this
moment for a long time.

33:31.800 --> 33:33.260
You realize how creepy
that sounds?

33:33.300 --> 33:33.720
And here you are.

33:34.590 --> 33:36.090
Literally gift wrapped for me.

33:36.130 --> 33:37.550
I think the word you're looking
for is figuratively, but--

33:37.600 --> 33:38.970
whatever.

33:39.010 --> 33:41.350
You have been a thorn in my side
for a long time, Jake.

33:41.390 --> 33:42.890
If you're thinking about trying
something,

33:42.930 --> 33:44.140
I know I'm a little messed up,

33:44.180 --> 33:45.690
but don't forget
I can still kick your--

33:46.150 --> 33:47.020
[punch]

33:48.060 --> 33:51.400
Ye-ew!
Man. That felt great.

33:51.440 --> 33:52.610
Arrgh.

33:56.530 --> 33:57.860
[Quinton] You're under arrest for D.U.I.

33:57.910 --> 33:58.990
Yeah. A bunch of things
wrong with that.

33:59.030 --> 34:00.950
I wasn't drunk.
And I wasn't driving.

34:00.990 --> 34:01.910
Details.

34:01.950 --> 34:02.620
Oh. And you're not a cop.

34:02.660 --> 34:03.830
Thanks to you.

34:03.870 --> 34:05.660
Woulda made it that last time.
Guaranteed.

34:05.710 --> 34:07.080
Except for that
one little hiccup.

34:07.120 --> 34:09.330
Hiccup? You shot our instructor
in the foot.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.300
You told me it was empty. You
looked me in the eyes and said:

34:11.340 --> 34:13.420
Quinton, the clip is empty.

34:13.460 --> 34:15.800
I said the clip was empty, but
there's one in the chamber.

34:15.840 --> 34:18.010
See if you want to be a cop,
you gotta check those things.

34:18.050 --> 34:20.090
It was my dream, Jake.

34:20.140 --> 34:22.890
Real law enforcement. Now you're
trying to ruin my life again.

34:22.930 --> 34:24.350
Yeah, the whole
stealing your car thing,

34:24.390 --> 34:25.770
that was Stanley's idea

34:25.810 --> 34:27.230
And you were
directly responsible

34:27.270 --> 34:28.560
for wrecking two others.

34:28.600 --> 34:29.770
Now I have to use
my supervisor's car.

34:30.690 --> 34:32.360
This is your supervisor's car?

34:33.780 --> 34:34.650
Ah --

34:35.280 --> 34:36.150
Oh God.

34:37.070 --> 34:38.450
What's going on back there?

34:38.490 --> 34:40.870
I get motion sickness whenever
I'm in the back seat.

34:42.490 --> 34:45.080
Remember that time, after that
party--I threw up in your car?

34:45.120 --> 34:45.460
That was you?

34:46.660 --> 34:48.170
You better not throw up
in my boss's car.

34:48.210 --> 34:49.250
I'll try not to, but -- Oh--

34:50.380 --> 34:51.750
You're not giving me
another choice.

34:52.170 --> 34:53.050
Toby--

34:59.800 --> 35:01.220
Get out and get in the front.

35:01.260 --> 35:02.970
Don't try anything or I'll shoot
you in the foot.

35:03.010 --> 35:04.930
Oh, that would be very poetic.
I get it.

35:05.640 --> 35:06.810
Oh my God, Quinton.

35:07.690 --> 35:08.770
What did you do to the door?

35:08.810 --> 35:10.020
Oh no. What?

35:10.060 --> 35:10.940
[crash]

35:13.070 --> 35:13.980
You'll be alright.

35:23.830 --> 35:24.580
[phone rings]

35:24.620 --> 35:26.080
Hello.

35:26.120 --> 35:28.960
[Charlie] Stanley says that
you know where the stash is.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.330
But in case it's another one
of his lies,

35:31.380 --> 35:32.960
I need you to bring it to me.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.800
When you do,
you can have Stanley back.

35:34.840 --> 35:36.300
I won't be needing him anymore.

35:36.340 --> 35:38.470
It turns out that he's got
nothing on me.

35:38.510 --> 35:38.840
Alright fine.

35:39.930 --> 35:41.590
Meet me at the
Goobies gas station.

35:41.640 --> 35:42.840
We'll do the exchange there.

35:42.890 --> 35:44.140
Breaking into my briefcase?

35:44.180 --> 35:45.430
What were you thinking?

35:45.470 --> 35:47.140
I am a Crown Attorney.
Do you have any idea --

35:47.180 --> 35:48.100
[phone rings]

35:48.140 --> 35:49.310
Don't even think about it.

35:49.350 --> 35:50.730
- Mal.
- I'm sorry. I have to.

35:51.980 --> 35:54.150
It's not like we can get
in any more trouble.

35:55.940 --> 35:57.940
- Jake.
- Tell your son--

35:57.980 --> 36:00.070
No problem.
We'll send help soon.

36:00.110 --> 36:01.110
Everything okay?

36:01.160 --> 36:02.320
It's gonna be.

36:02.360 --> 36:05.280
Leslie. Jake's gonna
text you an address.

36:05.330 --> 36:07.120
- Okay.
- Sergeant. Hold on.

36:07.160 --> 36:09.700
I want Stanley Westcott.
Or you're going to jail.

36:09.750 --> 36:12.170
I don't think you're gonna be
charging us with anything.

36:12.210 --> 36:14.630
He's right.
So stop playing politics.

36:16.630 --> 36:18.010
Would you give us a second?

36:18.880 --> 36:20.720
This was really informative.

36:21.880 --> 36:22.590
So I throw my hat
in the political ring.

36:23.720 --> 36:25.300
Happens all the time.
It's not illegal.

36:25.350 --> 36:27.970
No. But obstructing a case to
score points in your riding is.

36:29.430 --> 36:32.100
High profile case where
you're in the news every day

36:32.140 --> 36:34.060
can only help .
in an election bid.

36:35.190 --> 36:35.820
Well.

36:37.190 --> 36:39.530
It looks like It's my word
against yours on that.

36:39.570 --> 36:40.490
[Rose]
True.

36:40.530 --> 36:41.610
But--

36:41.650 --> 36:42.650
We do know about those

36:42.700 --> 36:44.200
individual campaign
contributions

36:44.240 --> 36:45.070
all for the same
maximum amount.

36:46.370 --> 36:48.540
Again, nothing illegal about
that. But I think

36:48.580 --> 36:50.500
the press is gonna have a field
day with this story.

36:53.750 --> 36:54.920
You've made your point.

36:54.960 --> 36:55.960
One more thing.

36:56.880 --> 36:58.300
Jake needs you to make a call.

37:10.100 --> 37:11.600
You okay, Stanley?

37:14.770 --> 37:16.060
I don't see my money.

37:16.100 --> 37:18.110
Relax. You'll get it.
I know where it is.

37:22.530 --> 37:23.530
Right Stanley?

37:30.790 --> 37:32.120
Alright.

37:32.160 --> 37:33.160
Hand over Stanley.

37:33.210 --> 37:34.330
Fine with me. Take him.

37:34.370 --> 37:36.580
He's going to jail
after the trial, anyway.

37:36.630 --> 37:37.790
Although according to him,

37:37.830 --> 37:40.050
this is actually really
his money.

37:40.090 --> 37:42.170
Seeing as he was
behind the entire scheme.

37:42.210 --> 37:43.510
What?

37:43.550 --> 37:45.470
Yeah.
Stanley said you were just

37:45.510 --> 37:49.600
the muscle, as usual.
This whole thing was his idea.

37:49.640 --> 37:52.390
That's why his testimony is
crap. He had nothing on you.

37:52.430 --> 37:53.560
I didn't tell you that,
Jake.

37:53.600 --> 37:54.850
I didn't tell him that.

37:54.890 --> 37:58.060
This idiot.
He talks a lot. Trust me.

37:58.110 --> 37:59.650
He just designed the code.

37:59.690 --> 38:01.860
He didn't know that me and my
gang were gonna use it to

38:01.900 --> 38:02.990
steal clients’ money.

38:03.740 --> 38:04.820
Now hand it over, now.

38:04.860 --> 38:05.700
[sirens]

38:05.740 --> 38:07.160
Oh, hey. Perfect timing.

38:07.200 --> 38:10.410
Stanley here will be awaiting
trial from a jail cell.

38:10.870 --> 38:11.240
No.

38:12.490 --> 38:13.950
I think you're the one who's
going to jail.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.710
You see.
There's a little camera there

38:16.750 --> 38:19.130
in the dashboard
of this police car.

38:19.170 --> 38:21.670
And it kinda caught
your whole confession.

38:21.710 --> 38:22.800
Did you get all that Quinton?

38:22.840 --> 38:24.970
Loud and clear.
Got it all on tape.

38:25.590 --> 38:26.800
Afternoon fellas.

38:26.840 --> 38:28.640
Let you slip away once today,
but not again.

38:28.680 --> 38:29.600
What is this?

38:29.640 --> 38:30.430
Shut it.

38:30.470 --> 38:31.640
That's what it is.

38:31.680 --> 38:33.680
I want you two to cuff
yourselves together.

38:33.720 --> 38:34.640
Get down on your knees.

38:35.310 --> 38:36.230
You got this Quin?

38:36.270 --> 38:37.890
Oh, I more than got this.

38:37.940 --> 38:39.810
Listen.
With all your help here.

38:39.860 --> 38:41.020
I'll talk to the cops.

38:41.060 --> 38:42.530
Maybe you'll get another
shot at the Academy.

38:43.480 --> 38:44.320
You're not going anywhere Jake.

38:45.150 --> 38:46.280
I'll shoot your tires out.

38:46.320 --> 38:47.490
Is he serious?

38:47.530 --> 38:48.990
Oh, I'm more than serious.

38:49.030 --> 38:49.910
[click]

38:52.530 --> 38:53.160
[click]

38:53.830 --> 38:54.870
[Jake]
Remember.

38:54.910 --> 38:56.960
I told you.
You always gotta check--

38:57.370 --> 38:58.620
Chamber.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.880
The chamber. That's where
the bullets go, buddy.

39:02.040 --> 39:04.380
Let's go get that
ten thousand dollars.

39:04.420 --> 39:05.460
Thanks for bringing my car back.

39:06.220 --> 39:07.340
This isn't over, Jake!

39:07.970 --> 39:10.050
[tire squeal]

39:17.810 --> 39:19.350
[Stanley] We hit the overpass pretty soon.

39:19.390 --> 39:20.650
You're gonna win this bet.

39:23.070 --> 39:24.070
What are you doing?

39:26.030 --> 39:28.240
Go on.
Get out before I change my mind.

39:28.280 --> 39:29.410
You're a good man, Jake.

39:30.360 --> 39:32.160
Sweet gesture,
but unnecessary.

39:32.200 --> 39:33.450
We have the evidence.

39:33.490 --> 39:35.830
Big Charlie's gonna
be going down. I'm not.

39:36.410 --> 39:36.910
Are you sure?

39:37.870 --> 39:39.410
I mean, you can stay on the run

39:39.460 --> 39:41.170
until all the charges
are dropped.

39:41.210 --> 39:43.460
I'm sure.
You deserve the payday.

39:43.500 --> 39:44.090
Thanks for everything.

39:45.250 --> 39:47.170
Thank you for an interesting
road trip.

39:48.050 --> 39:49.340
Well, the best part is--

39:49.380 --> 39:51.260
All those people
get their money back.

39:52.550 --> 39:56.180
Now, I know you don't want to
hear this, but--

39:56.850 --> 39:57.810
You should really

39:57.850 --> 39:59.140
call your girlfriend.

40:00.520 --> 40:01.980
Yeah. If I still have one.

40:03.190 --> 40:06.070
I hope your father
is proud of you, Jake.

40:06.480 --> 40:06.940
He is.

40:08.490 --> 40:11.360
And Stanley. I hope someday you
get a family of your own.

40:12.280 --> 40:13.990
Heh, heh.
I lied about that.

40:15.450 --> 40:18.870
I have three sons, two
daughters, all in university.

40:18.910 --> 40:20.080
Very successful.

40:22.500 --> 40:23.670
Unbelievable.

40:27.050 --> 40:28.010
Thanks.

40:30.880 --> 40:31.760
Hi.

40:31.800 --> 40:31.840
Sergeant Bennett.

40:33.220 --> 40:36.680
Tinny. You know my name.
We're both off duty here.

40:36.720 --> 40:39.310
Yeah.
I've been off duty all week.

40:40.390 --> 40:41.930
But you already knew that.

40:41.980 --> 40:43.730
You got a lot of potential.
But you're still a rookie.

40:44.980 --> 40:47.230
And you're developing a bit of
an attitude.

40:47.270 --> 40:48.690
If you say so, Sarge.

40:48.730 --> 40:50.490
Cut it out.
And quit acting like a rebel.

40:50.530 --> 40:52.240
The Force has no place for it.

40:52.280 --> 40:53.860
So think long and hard
about your future.

40:55.160 --> 40:56.910
You'll have a good one
if you don't mess it up.

41:02.910 --> 41:05.130
Hey. I thought you were
leaving with Grayson.

41:05.170 --> 41:06.290
Are you okay?

41:06.330 --> 41:08.000
I wasn't feeling too hot.

41:08.040 --> 41:09.090
Well, you look hot.

41:10.340 --> 41:11.260
I'll see you guys.

41:12.380 --> 41:13.260
She okay?

41:13.300 --> 41:14.680
I think so.

41:14.720 --> 41:17.510
Come on back here. Tell me again
how you saved the day.

41:22.430 --> 41:24.400
Well, son. I'm impressed.

41:26.400 --> 41:27.650
And a bet is a bet.

41:29.690 --> 41:30.070
You get the full fee.

41:31.570 --> 41:33.320
You know, either you're getting
soft in your old age--

41:34.240 --> 41:35.780
Or you wanted me
to win that bet.

41:35.820 --> 41:39.330
No Jake. You needed the cash.
You won the bet fair and square.

41:41.370 --> 41:42.290
Whoa.

41:43.290 --> 41:44.210
Sorry.

41:44.250 --> 41:45.290
[Mal]
Jake.

41:45.330 --> 41:46.080
Meet Inspector Smallwood.

41:47.040 --> 41:48.210
So you're
the Jake Doyle, huh?

41:48.880 --> 41:50.460
Heard a lot about you.

41:50.500 --> 41:54.510
Yeah, well. I've never heard of
you, so-- Nice to meet you.

41:55.510 --> 41:57.430
Inspector,
have a drink on us.

41:57.470 --> 41:58.760
[Jake]
Yeah. Sure. Why not?

41:58.800 --> 42:00.470
Ned will set you up
all the way over there.

42:00.510 --> 42:04.600
Thanks Malachy. I think I will.
See you around, Doyle.

42:05.140 --> 42:05.190
What a tool.

42:06.810 --> 42:09.770
This is why you have no friends.
You're lucky to have Leslie.

42:09.820 --> 42:10.270
[phone rings]

42:11.070 --> 42:11.860
Ah, speak of the devil.

42:12.990 --> 42:14.700
Well, hello, Leslie Bennett.
Are you--

42:14.740 --> 42:15.400
[beep]

42:15.990 --> 42:17.070
Hello? Leslie?

42:19.870 --> 42:21.120
It doesn't feel so good
when you got

42:21.160 --> 42:23.200
someone hanging up on you
all the time, does it?

42:24.080 --> 42:24.330
No.

42:25.580 --> 42:29.130
No, it feels awful
and terrible. And I'm--

42:30.880 --> 42:32.460
I'm really, really
sorry about that.

42:34.090 --> 42:34.130
How about I make it
up to you?

42:35.670 --> 42:38.890
I'll take you to a really nice,
quiet place. Very close.

42:38.930 --> 42:40.390
Like upstairs and we can--

42:41.100 --> 42:42.180
We can make out?

42:43.020 --> 42:43.890
No.
