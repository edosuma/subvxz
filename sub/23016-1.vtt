11:57.801 --> 12:00.573

say much to him
about Rudy Sr.,

12:00.573 --> 12:02.410

know what to say.

he wants to imagine,

him down sometime

told him already?

I don't want to see him

12:30.265 --> 12:31.802

anything about him

to have anything
to do with him ever.

Mmm... Yeah, yeah.

19:06.223 --> 19:08.929

getting postcards from
all across the country.

19:08.929 --> 19:11.000
Oh, yeah.
I've been all over, man.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.402
Pretty cool.

19:12.402 --> 19:14.106
It's good to
have you back here,
I'll tell you that.

19:14.106 --> 19:15.810
Oh, thanks, Darryl.
Good to see you, too.

19:15.810 --> 19:17.312
Keep enforcing the peace.

19:17.312 --> 19:19.751
It'll be a little harder now
you're here,
but I'll do what I can.

19:19.751 --> 19:20.886
No, man, I'm reformed.

19:20.886 --> 19:21.988
Oh, yeah.

19:21.988 --> 19:24.193
All right.
Hey, I'll see you around.
All right.

19:24.193 --> 19:25.596
Don't be a stranger,
all right?

19:25.596 --> 19:27.032
You, too. Take care.

19:53.017 --> 19:54.152
Sorry about yesterday.

19:54.152 --> 19:55.421
I don't care.

19:55.421 --> 19:57.259
I was studying
the bus description,

19:57.259 --> 19:58.996
and I got on
the wrong bus.

19:58.996 --> 20:01.367
I mean,
I missed my stop.
I don't care, Terry.

20:02.369 --> 20:03.906

20:03.906 --> 20:06.143
I'm glad to see you,
too, Sammy.

20:07.145 --> 20:09.449
Um, so you're coming
from work?

20:09.984 --> 20:11.153
Uh...

20:11.153 --> 20:12.322
No, it's Saturday.

20:13.491 --> 20:16.598
Yeah.
No, it's just you're
dressed so formally.

20:16.598 --> 20:20.305
Oh. No. You know,
I thought I'd...

20:20.305 --> 20:21.574

dressed up, too.

20:27.954 --> 20:29.557

20:29.557 --> 20:32.897

20:40.679 --> 20:42.449
I'm fine, Terry.

20:43.652 --> 20:45.823

20:45.823 --> 20:47.492
We're fine, Terry.

20:50.131 --> 20:51.534
How are you?

20:53.004 --> 20:54.640
Uh, yeah.

20:54.640 --> 20:56.978
Where have you
been lately, Terry?

20:56.978 --> 20:59.216
Uh, no,
I haven't been...

20:59.216 --> 21:01.554
I got a postcard
from you from Alaska.

21:01.554 --> 21:03.592
Yeah, yeah.
I was out there
for a little while.

21:03.592 --> 21:04.927
That was in
the fall, Terry.

21:04.927 --> 21:06.698
Yeah. I know.
I've been out of touch.

21:06.698 --> 21:08.134
I was a little worried.
I mean...

21:08.134 --> 21:09.704
I've been to a lot
of different places.

21:09.704 --> 21:13.044
Uh, I was down in Florida
for a little while.

21:13.044 --> 21:16.183
Uh, I was doing some
work in Orlando.

21:16.183 --> 21:18.054
Man, I've been
all over the place.

21:18.054 --> 21:23.732
Well, I wish you
had just let me know
you were okay.

21:23.732 --> 21:26.303
Yeah, I didn't realize
it had been so long.

Uh, I got all these things
I got to do back in Worcester.

21:41.634 --> 21:42.837
Oh.

21:42.837 --> 21:44.574
So I'm probably
not gonna be able

21:44.574 --> 21:46.343
to stay for more
than a day or so.

21:46.778 --> 21:49.149
Oh.

21:49.149 --> 21:50.786
I mean, I'm trying
to keep to
a schedule of sorts.

21:50.786 --> 21:51.988
Mmm-hmm.

21:51.988 --> 21:54.392

That's all right.

22:10.559 --> 22:13.197
Are you
expecting someone?

22:13.965 --> 22:16.069
Who would I
be expecting here?

22:16.069 --> 22:17.873
You just keep
looking around,
that's all.

22:17.873 --> 22:19.644
I was just, you know,
actually wondering

22:19.644 --> 22:22.115
if we could get some more
refreshments, actually.

22:33.404 --> 22:36.443
I actually gotta confess
to you, Sammy,

22:36.443 --> 22:40.051
that the reason that
you may not have heard
from me for a while

22:40.051 --> 22:42.021
is that...

22:42.021 --> 22:46.496
I've been unable
to write on the account
of the fact that

22:50.906 --> 22:52.743
I was in jail
for a little while.

22:54.379 --> 22:55.949
You were what?

22:55.949 --> 22:58.855
I served a little time,
I guess, down in Florida.

22:58.855 --> 23:00.993
It was just for...
It was for bullshit.
What?

23:00.993 --> 23:02.830
It was for bullshit.
What did you do?

23:02.830 --> 23:05.234
I didn't do anything.
Does it occur to you
that maybe I was wronged?

23:05.234 --> 23:07.171
No! Oh, my God!
Well...
Would you please...

23:07.171 --> 23:09.476
Please let me tell
you what happened.
What happened?

23:09.476 --> 23:11.313
I got into a fight in
a bar down in Florida.

23:11.313 --> 23:14.219
Which I was not the one
who instigated it at all.

23:14.219 --> 23:15.889
Then they worked up
all this bullshit
against me

23:15.889 --> 23:17.559
and threw me in the pen
for three months.

23:17.559 --> 23:19.864
I didn't write you 'cause
I didn't want you
to get all upset about it.

23:19.864 --> 23:21.066
I just figured that
you would figure

23:21.066 --> 23:22.402
I was on the road
for a little while.

23:22.402 --> 23:23.805
It was stupid.
I'm sorry.

23:23.805 --> 23:25.776
I didn't mean
to make you worry.

23:26.577 --> 23:27.780
But you wanna
know what?

23:27.780 --> 23:29.149
I can't run around
doing stuff

23:29.149 --> 23:30.986
or not doing stuff
because it's gonna
make you worry.

23:30.986 --> 23:33.424
Because then I come back here,
I tell you about
my fucking traumas,

23:33.424 --> 23:35.161
and I get this wounded
little, "I've let you down"
bullshit

23:35.161 --> 23:36.330
over and over again.

23:36.330 --> 23:39.537
It just cramps me.
I just wanna get
out from under it.

23:39.537 --> 23:41.173
And now I'm back
in this fucking hole

23:41.173 --> 23:42.408

to you again.

23:42.408 --> 23:43.578
Will you please stop
cursing at me?

23:43.578 --> 23:44.914

I'm in no position

23:44.914 --> 23:46.684
to basically say
anything ever,

23:46.684 --> 23:48.087
but it's not like
I'm down there

23:48.087 --> 23:49.557
in some redneck bar
in Florida,

23:49.557 --> 23:51.828
I'm having an argument
with some
stripper's boyfriend

23:51.828 --> 23:54.032
and I suddenly say to myself,
"Hey, this would be
a great time

23:54.032 --> 23:55.301
"to really stick it to Sammy

23:55.301 --> 23:56.771
"and get myself locked up
for a few months."

23:56.771 --> 23:59.342
Hey! You don't write me
for six months.

23:59.342 --> 24:01.012

where you are!
I'm sorry.

24:01.012 --> 24:02.583
I don't know if
you're alive or dead!

24:02.583 --> 24:04.486
I'm sorry.
And then you show up
out of nowhere.

24:04.486 --> 24:05.822
You tell me
you were in jail!

24:05.822 --> 24:07.058
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Worcester tomorrow.

24:38.955 --> 24:41.493
I got this girl there,

24:41.493 --> 24:44.432

in a bad situation.

a question?

Sure.

to church anymore?

Can we not talk
about that shit?

25:26.851 --> 25:28.120
Do you?

25:28.120 --> 25:29.455
Um, no, Sammy, I don't.

25:29.455 --> 25:30.825
Can you tell me
why not?

25:30.825 --> 25:33.731
Um, yeah, because I think
it's ridiculous.

25:33.731 --> 25:36.303
Well, can you tell me
without, like, degrading
what I believe in?

25:36.303 --> 25:38.775
I think it's primitive, okay?
I think it's a fairy tale.

ever considered
that maybe that's part

31:45.608 --> 31:49.181
Oh. Hi, Sammy.
What can I do for you?

31:49.181 --> 31:53.624
Um, Brian, did you
want us to hand
these timesheets in

31:53.624 --> 31:57.297
at the end of the day
or at the end of the week?

31:57.297 --> 31:59.769
Uh, yeah, end of the day
will be fine.

32:01.439 --> 32:04.478
It just seems
like an awful lot
of extra paperwork.

32:04.478 --> 32:06.148
I like paperwork.

32:37.444 --> 32:38.647
You showed up.

32:38.647 --> 32:39.816
Looks that way.

32:48.700 --> 32:50.270
Put on your seat belt.

32:50.270 --> 32:51.740
It pushes on my neck.

32:52.240 --> 32:53.409
What?

32:53.409 --> 32:55.881
It pushes on my neck.
It's uncomfortable.

32:55.881 --> 32:57.718
Well, when someone
slams into us

32:57.718 --> 32:59.589
and you go sailing
through the windshield,

32:59.589 --> 33:03.196
that's liable to be
uncomfortable, too.
Now put on your seat belt.

33:08.607 --> 33:10.945
Mom's parents died
in a car accident.

33:10.945 --> 33:12.715

They're my parents, too.

33:12.715 --> 33:14.686

Yeah.

Your mom's my sister.

33:16.823 --> 33:18.226
Yeah, I know.

33:18.226 --> 33:20.396
So that means
we have the same parents.

33:20.396 --> 33:21.666

33:22.300 --> 33:23.737
Oh, yeah.

Terry and Rudy never
showed up at her house.

a lot more power
on that. You know?

You should be
able to hit that nail
in two or three hits. Look.

34:28.331 --> 34:30.136
That's not the way
I hold it.

34:30.136 --> 34:32.239
Well, the way
you hold it is wrong.

wanna see me?

Yeah. Yeah, I was kind of
wondering what happened
to you today.

35:37.605 --> 35:41.044
Oh, didn't Mabel tell you?
I had a false alarm
about my son.

35:41.044 --> 35:43.415
Yeah, well,
I kind of thought you were
gonna work that out.

35:43.415 --> 35:45.453
Well, I did work it out,
more or less.

in Vietnam, either.

38:01.626 --> 38:02.828

with him?

Mmm... Not really. I mean,
we had some friends
in common, I guess.

very much.

I don't know.
He was always, like...

38:20.429 --> 38:23.335
He always had to be better
than you at everything,
you know?

38:23.335 --> 38:26.007
Like, if we were
all playing basketball
or something,

38:26.007 --> 38:27.845
everybody's having,
like, a friendly game,

38:27.845 --> 38:30.416
and he's ready to, like,
kill somebody if
his team didn't win.

38:30.416 --> 38:33.322
Or, like, if you told,
like, a joke or a story,

38:33.322 --> 38:35.292
he always had
to tell a better one.

38:35.292 --> 38:37.163

it was pretty scummy

how he split on
you and your mom.

clandestine thing
we did for fun.

It wasn't a big secret.
I mean, who cares?

01:00:54.769 --> 01:00:56.573
I mean,
I was actually
trying to be nice to him.

01:00:56.573 --> 01:00:59.011
But he's so
freaked out that he
disobeyed your orders

01:00:59.011 --> 01:01:00.681
that he's got to
fucking squeal on me,

01:01:00.681 --> 01:01:02.350
and then I got
to fucking listen
to your shit all day.

01:01:02.350 --> 01:01:04.288
And I didn't
fucking do anything.
Okay.

01:01:04.288 --> 01:01:07.427
First of all,
he didn't say anything.
Darryl did. Okay?

01:01:07.427 --> 01:01:09.599
And second of all,
I don't give a shit

01:01:09.599 --> 01:01:11.068
if you take him
out to play pool.

01:01:11.068 --> 01:01:14.341
I was mad at you
because you left him
at the bus stop in the rain.

01:01:14.341 --> 01:01:16.780
But no, I don't want
you telling him
not to squeal

been the model citizen

things have been going
for me lately,

I thought I was
doing pretty well.

kind of discouraging
that you seem to think

that I'm in need of
some sort of spiritual
guidance or what have you,

01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:53.158
so much so,
that you're willing
to disregard the fact

that I don't believe in
any of this stuff at all.

to discourage you.

come talk to you

the same thing I told her,

which is that as
far as I'm concerned,

01:09:20.312 --> 01:09:22.818
the only way she can help you
is by her example,

01:09:22.818 --> 01:09:24.621

a model for you

she lives her life.

that she's supposed
to be a saint either,

what I do is
very connected with the real

that my happiness
and comfort

closing my eyes
to trouble within myself

in other people.

do you think
your life is important?

Mmm, I'm not really sure.
What do you mean?

01:10:41.709 --> 01:10:43.646
I mean, it's important
to me, I guess,

01:10:43.646 --> 01:10:46.952

you know, the people
who care about me.

it's important?

Do you think it's important
in the scheme of things

it's yours

you're somebody's
brother.

believe in something

I want to believe in
it or not believe in it

it's true or not.

I want to think that
my life is important.

to something important.

to believe that

it is that you object to?

It's no good for you.

01:35:17.624 --> 01:35:21.398
And it's sure as heck
no good for the bank.

the worst manager
we've ever had.

I mean, by far,
the worst.

I don't want to
trade insults with you.

01:35:27.476 --> 01:35:28.913
Well, I don't want
to be fired, Brian.

here for seven years.
(SIGHS) Well...

You know,
and if I were you,

01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:34.257
I'd be a little
nervous about
firing an employee

01:35:34.257 --> 01:35:37.163

an affair with, okay?

01:35:37.163 --> 01:35:39.735
What? Hey, don't...
Don't threaten me, Sammy.

01:35:39.735 --> 01:35:40.971
I'm not threatening you.

01:35:40.971 --> 01:35:42.507
I'm not threatening you.

01:35:42.507 --> 01:35:46.047
I just... I think
it's an area that
we ought to explore.

01:35:46.047 --> 01:35:48.686
You explore it.
I'm going back to work.

01:35:50.255 --> 01:35:52.460
Oh, and I have to
pick up Rudy today

01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:53.730
because there's
no one else
who can do it.

01:35:53.730 --> 01:35:55.432
I'll find someone else
when I have time.

01:35:55.432 --> 01:35:57.838

over the whole bank?

he'd be staying,

I don't know if he's
still in town or not.

01:36:37.249 --> 01:36:39.588
Rudy, are you not
speaking to me?

01:36:46.569 --> 01:36:48.371
I'm really sorry that
you're so mad at me,

01:36:48.371 --> 01:36:51.144
but I only did what I
thought I had to do.

01:36:51.144 --> 01:36:54.585
And I just hope you
don't stay mad at me
for the rest of your life.

01:37:07.744 --> 01:37:09.882
Rudy, that's enough. Rudy!

01:37:12.453 --> 01:37:13.923
Now, you gotta
cut this out!

You don't know what
you're talking about.

There was nothing else
I could do.

I don't know how
to explain it to you
any better than that.

go on this way

know anything about it.

what you're doing.
Okay, I'm sorry.

I don't want you
to be sorry!
I want you to stop it!

and see that girl.

what happens there,

01:44:20.509 --> 01:44:23.114

if there's some work
for me out west.

I'm gonna go out
there this summer

make some money.

else out.
