WEBVTT

00:05.965 --> 00:07.466
You're coming with me,
the four of you.

00:07.550 --> 00:09.093
Your life isn't going to be
what you thought.

00:09.176 --> 00:10.636
Fal Dara always has

00:10.720 --> 00:13.180
and always will
be able to protect its own.

00:13.264 --> 00:15.015
Your power may not
have been strong enough.

00:15.099 --> 00:16.642
<i>You spent many years training</i>

00:16.726 --> 00:17.935
<i>with my sisters
at the White Tower.</i>

00:18.018 --> 00:20.354
<i>The Dark One
has begun to use the Ways</i>

00:20.438 --> 00:21.772
<i>to move his armies.</i>

00:21.856 --> 00:23.983
I could've sworn I just
saw Padan Fain walk past us.

00:24.066 --> 00:25.943
<i>- The peddler?</i>
- Mat!
- Mat!

00:26.026 --> 00:27.194
What if it's him?

00:27.278 --> 00:29.029
One thing
we cannot afford is for

00:29.113 --> 00:30.030
<i>the Dragon to turn
to the Shadow.</i>

00:30.114 --> 00:31.490
I don't want you to die.

00:33.159 --> 00:35.536
<i>But whichever of you
goes to the Eye of the World</i>

00:35.619 --> 00:36.620
<i>and is not the Dragon,</i>

00:36.704 --> 00:37.872
you will die there.

00:37.955 --> 00:39.498
We left the Two Rivers

00:39.582 --> 00:40.958
<i>to protect the people we love.</i>

00:41.041 --> 00:42.460
No matter the cost.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.503
But they're all linked,
all four of them.

00:44.587 --> 00:46.547
- Is that unusual?
- Very.

00:46.630 --> 00:49.049
The most powerful
channeler we've seen

00:49.133 --> 00:50.050
<i>in a thousand years.</i>

00:50.134 --> 00:51.218
Channel for me, girl.

00:51.302 --> 00:52.261
Light protect me.

00:52.344 --> 00:53.554
What are you?

00:53.637 --> 00:56.223
You are a king
without a kingdom.

00:56.307 --> 00:58.601
Malkier was taken
by the Blight so long ago.

00:58.684 --> 01:00.853
- No!
-

01:00.936 --> 01:02.354
Moiraine masked our bond.

01:02.438 --> 01:03.939
I don't understand.

01:04.023 --> 01:06.567
<i>- She left.
- By herself?</i>

01:06.650 --> 01:08.152
Rand.

01:08.235 --> 01:11.781
You are
the Dragon Reborn.

01:21.999 --> 01:23.626
No.

01:23.709 --> 01:24.877
Latra, we--

01:24.960 --> 01:28.214
You have presented your case
and you have our answer.

01:28.297 --> 01:31.801
So, that's it then?

01:31.884 --> 01:34.553
You would break the Aes Sedai
in two? Men against women?

01:34.637 --> 01:36.764
It's you who breaks us.

01:36.847 --> 01:38.432
You can't stop me.

01:40.267 --> 01:42.228
I can't.

01:44.188 --> 01:46.190
We have a chance, here

01:46.273 --> 01:49.109
to do something
that's never been done before--

01:49.193 --> 01:51.153
to cage the Dark One,

01:51.237 --> 01:54.782
to stop His influence from
touching this world ever again.

01:54.865 --> 01:58.369
When you and I became Aes Sedai,
we swore an oath to serve all.

01:58.452 --> 02:01.372
What you plan to do?
It serves only your pride.

02:01.455 --> 02:02.748
You're wrong.

02:02.832 --> 02:05.960
You expose the very source
of the One Power to Him.

02:06.043 --> 02:08.712
If He touches and corrupts it,

02:08.796 --> 02:11.090
your Power will be
out of control.

02:11.173 --> 02:12.591
It will run unchecked.

02:12.675 --> 02:17.805
You and your men could throw us
back a thousand years or more.

02:19.557 --> 02:22.601
If you help us, we won't fail.

02:26.647 --> 02:30.442
We will remain, to pick up the
pieces as best we can if you do.

02:33.612 --> 02:34.864
What's wrong?

02:34.947 --> 02:40.119
To think, the fate of the world
was decided in a nursery.

02:42.371 --> 02:45.583
Nothing was decided here.

02:45.666 --> 02:48.878
The decision rests solely
with you, when you face Him.

02:48.961 --> 02:50.754
This is just an imperfect,

02:50.838 --> 02:54.258
overwhelmed woman trying to
remind her old friend

02:54.341 --> 02:56.927
that he's not invincible.

03:00.306 --> 03:02.933
Light be with you,

03:03.017 --> 03:05.811
Lews Therin Telamon,

03:05.895 --> 03:07.563
Dragon Reborn.

03:07.938 --> 03:10.816
And you, Latra Posae Decume,

03:10.900 --> 03:12.651
Tamyrlin Seat,

03:12.735 --> 03:14.445
Watcher of the Flame.

03:19.783 --> 03:21.201
Sweetheart.

03:22.286 --> 03:25.247
Sweetheart, daddy's here.

03:26.457 --> 03:31.795
Today I make the world
safe for you.

05:41.759 --> 05:42.885
What happened to him?

05:42.968 --> 05:44.428
Boys from the Borderlands

05:44.511 --> 05:47.431
sometimes like to test
themselves against the Blight.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.391
And they usually
come up wanting.

05:49.475 --> 05:51.018
Don't touch him.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.437
Don't touch anything here.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.564
The Blight is a rot

05:55.647 --> 05:57.900
which spreads from
the Dark One's prison

05:57.983 --> 06:00.402
and consumes everything
in its path.

06:00.486 --> 06:04.323
Including young men
in way over their heads.

06:16.001 --> 06:18.170
You know we can't go.

06:18.253 --> 06:20.881
We have no idea where they are,
where they're going.

06:20.964 --> 06:23.133
Only Moiraine does.

06:25.469 --> 06:27.346
We'll die in the Blight.

06:36.271 --> 06:38.273
I love him, Perrin.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.493
So do I.

06:53.705 --> 06:54.915
Are we all right?

06:57.084 --> 06:58.502
We'll always be all right.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.482
Good.

07:21.483 --> 07:23.485
We're getting closer.

07:25.154 --> 07:26.655
We can rest here.

07:27.656 --> 07:29.491
For half an hour, no more.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.286
What are those?

07:32.369 --> 07:34.121
The Seven Towers
of Malkier.

07:34.204 --> 07:36.582
Malkier?

07:36.665 --> 07:38.917
That's where Lan said
he was born.

07:39.001 --> 07:41.211
It looks like it's been
that way a thousand years.

07:41.295 --> 07:42.921
Forty at most.

07:43.005 --> 07:46.049
Three years ago,
it was miles from Tarwin's Gap.

07:46.133 --> 07:49.845
It's just another sign that the
Dark One's strength is building.

08:02.024 --> 08:04.026
- Was it hard?
- What?

08:06.111 --> 08:08.405
To leave him behind.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.203
Here.

08:14.286 --> 08:16.496
Have some of that.

08:16.580 --> 08:18.790
You need to keep up
your strength.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.102
Are you all right?

08:42.731 --> 08:44.650
Can you feel anything
through the bond?

08:44.733 --> 08:47.236
She doesn't want to be followed.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.034
Not to what she's facing now.

08:56.370 --> 08:58.622
After the Trolloc attack
in the Two Rivers,

08:58.705 --> 09:00.290
when I followed you...

09:01.792 --> 09:03.418
It wasn't you who I tracked.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.046
It was her.

09:06.129 --> 09:07.923
She has a tell.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.551
I can show you how.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.639
You would let me go without you?

09:15.722 --> 09:17.641
You bring him back.

09:23.188 --> 09:25.190
You are a remarkable woman,
Wisdom.

09:27.484 --> 09:29.111
A Wisdom never weds.

09:30.779 --> 09:32.322
But if I go to Tar Valon,

09:32.406 --> 09:35.242
it may be I'll be something
other than a Wisdom.

09:39.621 --> 09:42.582
I will hate the man you choose.

09:45.127 --> 09:46.920
Because he is not me.

09:47.963 --> 09:51.133
And I will love him
if he makes you smile.

09:52.509 --> 09:55.470
You are as beautiful
as the sunrise.

09:58.557 --> 10:00.642
You are as fierce as a warrior.

10:06.565 --> 10:08.567
You are a lioness, Wisdom.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.327
Tell me how to find them.

10:28.545 --> 10:29.713
What?

10:31.131 --> 10:32.466
What did you dream?

10:32.549 --> 10:34.468
Dreams have great meaning,

10:34.551 --> 10:36.511
especially here,
so close to his touch.

10:36.595 --> 10:38.096
It was the Dark One.

10:38.180 --> 10:39.973
He knows where we are.
He's coming.

10:56.031 --> 10:58.909
I wouldn't have
expected it would be you.

11:15.175 --> 11:18.095
There.
That's better.

11:18.178 --> 11:21.181
Hard to have
a real conversation otherwise.

11:24.559 --> 11:26.728
You look nothing like him.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.690
But still, you're him.

11:35.404 --> 11:37.781
I see it behind your eyes.

11:41.076 --> 11:42.953
So what's your plan,
Lews Therin?

11:43.036 --> 11:45.038
- You have one, right?
- No, this is a dream.

11:45.122 --> 11:46.873
Does it matter?

11:46.957 --> 11:48.166
Whether you're asleep or awake?

11:48.250 --> 11:50.168
I mean, either way, here we are,

11:50.252 --> 11:51.461
finally having
a conversation once again.

11:51.545 --> 11:52.462
Sit down.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.840
It's pathetic, you know.

11:54.923 --> 11:58.510
Coming for me with
a single Aes Sedai at your side.

11:58.593 --> 12:02.472
The last time, you...
you came with 99 companions,

12:02.556 --> 12:05.809
far stronger than her, and...
and still you failed.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.895
Have you even touched
the Power before?

12:08.979 --> 12:11.231
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

12:12.190 --> 12:13.608
Ooh.

12:18.113 --> 12:20.365
A heron-marked blade.

12:20.449 --> 12:21.616
Where did you get that?

12:21.700 --> 12:23.535
From my father.

12:26.163 --> 12:29.541
Your father has been dead
a long time, boy.

12:31.751 --> 12:36.089
Oh, you mean... you mean
that shepherd in the Two Rivers?

12:36.173 --> 12:37.549
What's his name again?

12:37.632 --> 12:40.177
Tam? Tam al'Thor, right?

12:42.554 --> 12:45.140
Oh, you really do think
he's your father.

12:45.223 --> 12:48.059
That's... that's sweet in a way.

12:48.143 --> 12:51.354
Who would've thought the
Dragon Reborn would be a fool?

12:52.814 --> 12:55.525
Every turning has
its little surprises, I suppose.

12:55.609 --> 12:56.776
This is a dream.

12:56.860 --> 12:59.321
Stubborn as ever, Lews.

13:00.530 --> 13:03.783
Come. Put down the sword.

13:03.867 --> 13:06.036
Let me tell you
what those women never would

13:06.119 --> 13:08.455
about what it means
to be the Dragon.

13:08.538 --> 13:09.706
This is a dream.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.299
What?

13:20.717 --> 13:22.052
What did you dream?

13:22.135 --> 13:24.054
Dreams have great meaning,

13:24.137 --> 13:26.097
especially here,
so close to his touch.

13:26.181 --> 13:27.933
It was the Dark One.

13:28.016 --> 13:30.227
What did he say to you?

13:30.310 --> 13:32.771
I don't believe a word he said.

13:38.026 --> 13:41.029
When we get there,
what's our plan?

13:41.112 --> 13:42.489
What did he say
to you in the dream?

13:42.572 --> 13:43.865
No, this is about you.

13:43.949 --> 13:46.785
You always have a plan
within a plan within a plan.

13:46.868 --> 13:49.704
Don't try to convince me that
for this you've got nothing.

13:55.126 --> 13:57.420
This is a sa'angreal.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.383
It was made before
the Breaking of the World,

14:01.466 --> 14:03.385
created from
the One Power itself.

14:03.468 --> 14:07.055
Thousands of male channelers put
the entirety of their strength

14:07.138 --> 14:10.141
into this one small object.

14:10.225 --> 14:13.270
And when you channel into it,

14:13.353 --> 14:16.189
it'll increase your power
a hundredfold.

14:29.661 --> 14:31.371
And what do I do
with that power?

14:31.454 --> 14:33.206
You put him back
where he belongs,

14:33.290 --> 14:37.210
where his touch can't reach the
Earth for another 3,000 years.

14:37.294 --> 14:38.712
Just that.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.803
You thought it would be Egwene.

14:48.013 --> 14:49.431
Didn't you?

14:52.309 --> 14:54.311
You taught her to channel.

14:56.187 --> 14:57.564
You introduced her
to your Amyrlin Seat.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.525
You thought it was her.

15:05.155 --> 15:06.865
So did I.

15:19.044 --> 15:20.879
What do you hear?

15:22.964 --> 15:23.965
Nothing.

15:25.508 --> 15:27.927
Ever since the day I channeled,
I hear nothing.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.681
Do you hear anything?

15:51.576 --> 15:53.370
What is it?

15:53.453 --> 15:55.497
Same thing we heard on Bel Tine.

15:56.498 --> 15:58.124
Something wrong.

15:59.626 --> 16:03.129
But if that was a whisper,
this is a scream.

16:37.122 --> 16:39.249
Will you teach me
how to channel?

16:39.332 --> 16:40.792
I can't.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.335
Every time you touch the Source,

16:42.419 --> 16:43.920
it'll take you closer and closer
to the madness.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.715
Oh, do you think I care
what happens to me after today?

16:46.798 --> 16:48.842
When you face him,
the fear, the adrenaline--

16:48.925 --> 16:51.469
you'll embrace the One Power
whether you want to or not.

16:51.553 --> 16:53.179
- What if I don't?
- You will.

16:55.056 --> 16:57.517
How can you be so sure?

17:00.979 --> 17:03.982
There was an Aes Sedai at the
White Tower when I was a novice.

17:04.065 --> 17:05.442
She was everything
that I wanted to be.

17:05.525 --> 17:08.820
She was strong,
controlled, precise.

17:08.903 --> 17:11.489
She... she was terrifying.

17:11.573 --> 17:12.991
And she took a liking to me.

17:13.074 --> 17:15.660
She said she wanted
to help make me everything

17:15.744 --> 17:17.537
that she thought I could be.

17:17.620 --> 17:20.165
And I was having...

17:20.248 --> 17:22.417
I was having trouble channeling.

17:22.500 --> 17:26.629
And she came
to my room at night,

17:26.713 --> 17:28.131
alone...

17:30.216 --> 17:32.510
...and she beat me
with the One Power.

17:33.595 --> 17:35.889
Lashes of air and fire.

17:35.972 --> 17:37.891
And she wouldn't stop

17:37.974 --> 17:40.727
until the pain and the fear
was so overwhelming that

17:40.810 --> 17:43.271
I grabbed the Power myself
and I stopped her.

17:43.354 --> 17:45.690
Without even thinking about it,
without even trying.

17:48.443 --> 17:50.528
I promise you,
when your life's on the line,

17:50.612 --> 17:53.281
the Power will be there.

17:53.364 --> 17:56.785
And when it comes to you, you
channel it into the sa'angreal.

18:11.216 --> 18:12.717
Agee, you're gonna want to move.

18:17.514 --> 18:18.640
We need some answers.

18:18.723 --> 18:20.099
Excuse me, sir.

18:20.183 --> 18:21.684
Fancy a drink first?

18:21.768 --> 18:23.895
- It's not even noon yet.
- You're the one in the bar.

18:23.978 --> 18:26.356
What did you tell Moiraine
about Rand?

18:26.439 --> 18:29.400
People's secrets are
their business, no one else's.

18:29.484 --> 18:32.028
Can't you at least tell us
if he's going to be all right?

18:32.111 --> 18:33.905
It's not how it works,
I'm afraid.

18:33.988 --> 18:37.575
All I know is that
everything I've ever seen,

18:37.659 --> 18:40.453
the best things and the worst...

18:40.537 --> 18:42.163
they've all come true
eventually.

18:54.717 --> 18:56.010
What is it?

19:12.151 --> 19:13.736
What is that?

19:16.406 --> 19:18.741
Well, he knows we're coming.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.077
But Egwene. And Perrin,
Nynaeve, they're in the city...

19:21.160 --> 19:24.205
The only way to stop that army
is to stop the Dark One himself.

19:29.252 --> 19:31.087
I told you
their numbers were building.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.171
How many?

19:32.255 --> 19:33.673
Our men in the fortress
have spotted

19:33.756 --> 19:34.841
at least 60 Fades amongst them,

19:34.924 --> 19:36.843
so there must be
at least 5,000 to 10,000.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.011
And there are
still more Trollocs

19:38.094 --> 19:39.387
pouring out of the Blight

19:39.470 --> 19:40.889
and gathering
at the mouth of Tarwin's Gap.

19:40.972 --> 19:45.018
I'll bloody skin them myself and
burn their goat-kissing hides.

19:45.101 --> 19:47.478
- Are they coming for the city?
-

19:47.562 --> 19:49.355
Not yet.

19:49.439 --> 19:52.358
But two ropes were cut
on the drawbridge.

19:52.442 --> 19:54.110
There are Darkfriends
inside our walls.

19:59.324 --> 20:01.034
We need
to send our entire force

20:01.117 --> 20:02.702
to support the men
in the Gap's fortress.

20:02.785 --> 20:04.203
The Gap won't hold.

20:06.915 --> 20:10.418
I'll ready my personal guard
and move to the fortress.

20:10.501 --> 20:12.003
You know what you need to do.

20:31.022 --> 20:33.024
The Gap will not hold.

20:51.876 --> 20:53.920
This is it, isn't it?

20:56.464 --> 20:58.091
I know this place.

21:08.559 --> 21:10.478
You said that whoever
goes with the Dragon

21:10.561 --> 21:12.563
to the Eye of the World
will die there.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.943
Does that include you?

21:22.240 --> 21:23.658
Stay.

21:59.068 --> 22:00.236
Do you remember the first time

22:00.319 --> 22:02.321
Father let us help him
with his armor?

22:04.782 --> 22:07.243
A thousand Trollocs
in the Gap.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.037
Seemed like there was
no chance he would stop them.

22:09.120 --> 22:13.332
That armor kept him safe
through hundreds of battles.

22:13.416 --> 22:15.877
And his father
through hundreds more.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.504
- And his father...
- I need my armor today,

22:18.588 --> 22:19.589
not theirs.

22:26.179 --> 22:27.722
You should stay in the city.

22:27.805 --> 22:30.016
The Gap cannot hold
against that force.

22:30.099 --> 22:31.309
It simply cannot.

22:33.895 --> 22:36.189
The men will hold the Gap.

22:36.272 --> 22:39.400
And if we cannot,
the women will hold the city.

22:40.485 --> 22:43.029
It is what our family has done
for a thousand years.

22:43.112 --> 22:46.407
What we face today is five times
the size of what's come before.

22:47.450 --> 22:48.868
We cannot...

22:50.828 --> 22:52.038
You're right, sister.

22:53.998 --> 22:56.000
You were right all along.

22:57.210 --> 23:00.129
We should have asked the
White Tower for aid long ago.

23:02.423 --> 23:05.051
Today, Tarwin's Gap will fall.

23:05.134 --> 23:07.136
And then this city
will fall after,

23:07.220 --> 23:09.305
no matter what we do.

23:10.932 --> 23:13.643
And then His armies
will pour through the Gap

23:13.726 --> 23:17.688
and raze every city we know
the name of and more we don't.

23:20.149 --> 23:21.943
The whole world will burn.

23:23.820 --> 23:25.738
The Dark One is waking.

23:27.073 --> 23:28.699
Tarmon Gai'don is here.

23:28.783 --> 23:30.034
The Last Battle.

23:40.294 --> 23:44.090
But it is not ours to win,
you and I.

23:47.969 --> 23:50.179
We will slow his forces
as much as we can,

23:50.263 --> 23:53.516
while our messengers fly
in every direction

23:53.599 --> 23:55.518
with the Light's speed
at their heels.

23:57.603 --> 23:59.814
Let us hope we buy the women
and men of this world

23:59.897 --> 24:02.567
enough time to stand
a fighting chance.

24:06.863 --> 24:09.282
I will not let our city fall.

24:45.026 --> 24:46.360
What was this place?

24:46.444 --> 24:49.447
We have no idea.

24:49.530 --> 24:51.616
Every record of
its existence was purged

24:51.699 --> 24:54.368
from the White Tower's libraries
by Darkfriends.

25:03.211 --> 25:05.171
You said
you remember this place.

25:06.214 --> 25:07.757
What do you remember?

25:09.425 --> 25:12.220
The pieces don't...
fit together.

25:12.303 --> 25:13.304
It's like...

25:15.306 --> 25:17.016
...a puzzle.

25:17.099 --> 25:18.601
Or a dream.

25:18.684 --> 25:22.521
Every time I grab onto
something, it just slips away.

25:36.744 --> 25:38.371
I fought someone here.

25:41.624 --> 25:42.959
The Dark One.

25:44.961 --> 25:47.004
But it looked like a man.

25:49.465 --> 25:50.466
It was here.

25:52.134 --> 25:53.386
In the center.

25:53.469 --> 25:55.221
There was a symbol.

25:57.473 --> 25:59.100
This symbol.

26:01.936 --> 26:03.271
The Eye.

26:39.223 --> 26:40.975
Oh!

26:43.477 --> 26:44.478
Egwene?

26:45.980 --> 26:48.399
- You finished already?
- What?

26:49.692 --> 26:51.569
- Finished?
- With the lantern.

26:51.652 --> 26:53.696
You know Mat's never
gonna find time

26:53.779 --> 26:55.448
to make a proper one for Joiya,

26:55.531 --> 26:58.284
- no matter how many times
he says he will.
-

27:01.579 --> 27:02.538
Joiya.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.665
You take her for a minute.

27:04.749 --> 27:06.083
I'll finish it.

27:07.084 --> 27:09.128
She'll only walk for you anyway.

27:11.005 --> 27:13.007
And it's a beautiful day.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.229
Rand.

27:27.313 --> 27:28.439
Rand.

27:29.440 --> 27:30.483
Rand.

27:30.566 --> 27:32.401
What did you think would happen?

27:56.342 --> 27:58.344
Must be an awful feeling.

28:00.137 --> 28:02.807
To know the One Power is there,

28:02.890 --> 28:07.144
just at the end
of your fingertips...

28:07.228 --> 28:10.064
but you can't quite touch it.

28:25.913 --> 28:27.373
For the Light!

28:27.456 --> 28:28.707
And Shienar!

28:49.770 --> 28:51.230
Keep the gates
open another hour

28:51.313 --> 28:52.940
<i>to allow foreigners to leave,</i>

28:53.023 --> 28:55.901
<i>but every Shienaran woman
or child stays</i>

28:55.985 --> 28:57.153
<i>to fight for our city.</i>

28:59.071 --> 29:01.615
<i>Take whatever you need
from the Royal Armory.</i>

29:01.699 --> 29:02.950
We leave nothing in reserve.

29:03.784 --> 29:05.828
<i>I need archers
on the North Wall,</i>

29:05.911 --> 29:09.039
<i>women ready to burn the bridges
when the time comes.</i>

29:09.123 --> 29:11.375
<i>And light every torch
in the city.</i>

29:11.459 --> 29:14.920
<i>There'll be no shadows
to hide a Fade tonight.</i>

29:15.004 --> 29:16.380
<i></i>

29:16.464 --> 29:20.301
Any woman who can channel the
One Power, be it even a trickle,

29:20.384 --> 29:22.261
I need them.

29:23.262 --> 29:26.682
Light protect Fal Dara!

29:26.765 --> 29:28.601
The city that has never fallen!

29:28.684 --> 29:30.603
The city
that has never fallen!

29:30.686 --> 29:33.439
<i>The city that has never fallen!</i>

30:01.675 --> 30:03.010
- We have to get out of here.
- To where?

30:03.093 --> 30:04.595
To Rand?
We don't even know where he is.

30:04.678 --> 30:05.804
They're going
to close the gates,

30:05.888 --> 30:06.847
and then we're trapped in here.

30:06.931 --> 30:08.182
We can't just leave them.

30:08.265 --> 30:10.184
What? What is it?

30:10.267 --> 30:12.478
They're calling for
all women who can channel.

30:12.561 --> 30:14.688
To help defend the city.

30:17.608 --> 30:20.444
I left the Two Rivers
to bring the four of you home.

30:21.987 --> 30:24.949
I've already lost Mat and Rand.
I can't lose you, too.

30:29.954 --> 30:32.831
Let them buy every step
they take with blood.

30:36.544 --> 30:38.837
Fire on my command.

30:38.921 --> 30:40.464
Ready!

30:48.305 --> 30:50.683
May the last embrace
of the mother welcome you home.

30:54.979 --> 30:56.105
Aim!

30:57.106 --> 30:58.983
Fire!

31:31.682 --> 31:33.475
Moiraine's two.

31:33.559 --> 31:34.727
I shouldn't be surprised.

31:34.810 --> 31:36.687
We're no one's but our own.

31:49.450 --> 31:50.909
How can we just sit here

31:50.993 --> 31:52.745
while everyone else
is willing to fight?

31:52.828 --> 31:54.788
I'm standing. You might...

31:54.872 --> 31:56.957
This is bullshit! All of it!

31:57.041 --> 31:59.460
The Way of the Leaf.

31:59.543 --> 32:02.796
What are we supposed to do,
just watch our friends die?!

32:02.880 --> 32:04.923
Of course not.

32:05.007 --> 32:08.927
There are always options
other than violence.

32:09.011 --> 32:10.512
What?

32:10.596 --> 32:11.764
What can we do?

32:11.847 --> 32:15.559
In my own experience,

32:15.643 --> 32:20.439
if you want to help
but don't know how,

32:20.522 --> 32:23.901
all you need to do is ask.

32:30.658 --> 32:32.159
What is it?

32:32.242 --> 32:33.911
What's wrong?

32:52.554 --> 32:53.514
Rand.

32:53.597 --> 32:56.433
How long have we lived here?

32:56.517 --> 32:59.061
Since we got back from the Eye.

33:00.688 --> 33:02.022
What's wrong with you?

33:02.106 --> 33:03.649
I thought you wanted to go
to the White Tower to...

33:03.732 --> 33:05.734
No, this is where I want to be.

33:08.404 --> 33:09.613
You all right?

33:13.117 --> 33:15.494
Do you remember...

33:15.577 --> 33:17.079
when we were little?

33:18.122 --> 33:20.541
We packed a bag and said
we were running away.

33:22.334 --> 33:25.421
I don't even remember why--
something your mum had said.

33:26.547 --> 33:28.382
But it was just you and me.

33:30.050 --> 33:32.052
We got as far as the Waterwood.

33:33.137 --> 33:36.640
But it started raining, it was
getting dark, and we stopped.

33:38.767 --> 33:40.769
And we spent the night there.

33:42.479 --> 33:43.981
Under a little tree.

33:44.064 --> 33:47.776
And in the morning, we weren't
as mad as we'd been before,

33:47.860 --> 33:49.903
so we went back home.

33:49.987 --> 33:53.449
But before we left, we carved
something into that tree.

33:54.742 --> 33:57.703
Do you remember what it was?

34:05.878 --> 34:07.713
"Our place.

34:10.424 --> 34:14.386
For this life and the next.

34:17.264 --> 34:18.682
Forever."

34:23.353 --> 34:25.230
- It's you.
-

34:28.776 --> 34:30.027
It's really you.

34:31.653 --> 34:33.113
Of course it is.

34:54.384 --> 34:56.887
You see? It is her.

34:58.472 --> 35:01.099
Or a version
of what could be her.

35:05.020 --> 35:06.396
What do you mean?

35:08.106 --> 35:11.235
Did no one tell you
what you can do?

35:11.318 --> 35:13.529
About the Power inside you?

35:14.780 --> 35:18.075
You can remake the world
in your image.

35:18.158 --> 35:20.577
Make it whatever
you want it to be.

35:20.661 --> 35:22.955
This, if you want.

35:25.541 --> 35:27.584
I can show you how.

35:37.302 --> 35:39.596
<i>I wonder what he'll choose.</i>

35:40.639 --> 35:44.059
Light or Dark?

35:45.102 --> 35:47.187
You didn't think
I'd come here without knowing

35:47.271 --> 35:49.356
what I was walking into,
did you?

35:49.439 --> 35:52.484
We both know you can't escape
this place without his help.

35:52.568 --> 35:55.195
And if he doesn't
choose the Light...

35:57.406 --> 35:59.408
...I'll choose for him.

36:05.873 --> 36:07.082
Lord Yakota.

36:08.375 --> 36:10.002
I said we were not
to be disturbed.

36:11.336 --> 36:13.672
Glory to the Builders.

36:13.755 --> 36:15.132
What can we do?

36:30.188 --> 36:32.232
Light help you, brother.

37:01.303 --> 37:03.221
The world...

37:03.305 --> 37:05.349
it all feels so stable.

37:06.433 --> 37:08.352
The truth is it's not.

37:08.435 --> 37:12.272
Everything that means anything
can be gone in an instant.

37:14.566 --> 37:17.569
No. No.

37:17.653 --> 37:19.863
- I thought you didn't
think she was real.
- Stop it!

37:22.157 --> 37:23.158
Stop it!

37:32.709 --> 37:34.336
What?

37:55.190 --> 37:56.817
How do I make it real?

37:59.319 --> 38:00.737
Simple.

38:01.822 --> 38:04.491
More simple than
you could imagine.

38:18.380 --> 38:21.466
The kingfisher
flashes above the pond.

38:24.678 --> 38:26.221
Who gave you
those words?

38:46.992 --> 38:49.411
- There it is.
- What is it?

38:49.494 --> 38:51.413
The Horn of bloody Valere, lad.

38:51.496 --> 38:53.832
To be blown at the Last Battle.

38:53.915 --> 38:57.252
To call the Pattern's greatest
heroes to stand at our side.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.337
-
- Well, then let's
hurry up and get it.

38:59.421 --> 39:01.673
We're not going to use it.

39:01.757 --> 39:03.300
It's for the Dragon.

39:03.383 --> 39:05.761
Without it,
they won't stand a chance.

39:13.143 --> 39:14.644
They're through.

39:14.728 --> 39:16.480
There must be 10,000, 20.

39:17.814 --> 39:19.024
Does this mean Rand...

39:19.107 --> 39:21.151
Did he fail?

39:22.819 --> 39:25.739
I need you
to open yourselves to me.

39:25.822 --> 39:27.407
When I reach out to you
with the One Power,

39:27.491 --> 39:28.825
accept it.

39:28.909 --> 39:29.951
Let me in.

39:32.996 --> 39:34.164
Are you ready?

39:54.017 --> 39:56.561
By the Light...

39:56.645 --> 39:57.813
the Power.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.424
Hey. Stop.

40:26.508 --> 40:27.634
What is it?

40:33.515 --> 40:35.517
Look into her eyes,

40:35.600 --> 40:39.604
and empty yourself
of everything.

40:41.398 --> 40:43.191
Of anger,

40:43.275 --> 40:45.944
of fear,

40:46.027 --> 40:48.029
of sadness.

40:48.113 --> 40:51.783
Turn it all into want.

40:53.702 --> 40:57.706
Want that little girl so much

40:57.789 --> 41:00.208
she simply is.

41:04.337 --> 41:05.547
Yes.

41:06.631 --> 41:07.841
There.

41:09.176 --> 41:11.344
Now release everything,

41:11.428 --> 41:13.722
everything inside you.

41:14.806 --> 41:18.059
Let the Power flow through you
like you're an open sieve.

41:20.395 --> 41:22.522
Don't fight it.

41:26.443 --> 41:28.403
Well...

41:28.486 --> 41:30.697
he's channeling.

41:30.780 --> 41:33.575
And you don't even know
what he's channeling to do.

41:34.993 --> 41:38.705
To break my chains
or to strengthen them.

41:48.048 --> 41:49.966
I need more!

42:15.992 --> 42:18.328
Make her yours.

42:18.411 --> 42:19.746
She already was.

42:20.747 --> 42:22.540
She already is.

42:35.178 --> 42:37.973
-
- Hold.

42:39.432 --> 42:41.059
Hold!

42:41.142 --> 42:44.604
Light protect Fal Dara,
the city that has never fallen!

43:30.150 --> 43:32.402
What are you doing? No.

43:32.485 --> 43:36.573
You can remake the world
in your image, boy.

43:36.656 --> 43:39.242
Make it what you want.

43:41.578 --> 43:43.747
What about what she wants?

43:43.830 --> 43:47.584
And as much as I love her,
as much as I want this,

43:47.667 --> 43:50.462
- I know that she doesn't.
- No.

43:50.545 --> 43:53.048
- That woman...
-

43:53.131 --> 43:55.175
...who doesn't care about
being a Wisdom...

43:56.259 --> 43:58.636
<i>...being an Aes Sedai...</i>

43:59.721 --> 44:03.350
...that's not the woman I love.

44:30.668 --> 44:32.087
What happened?

44:37.592 --> 44:38.843
I did it.

45:03.201 --> 45:05.787
-
- Loial!

45:09.707 --> 45:11.626
-
- No!

45:15.713 --> 45:17.048
Padan Fain.

45:27.225 --> 45:29.727
-
- Enough!

45:29.811 --> 45:30.812
We stopped them!

45:30.895 --> 45:32.689
I can't let go!

45:35.108 --> 45:37.444
Nynaeve! I'm burning!

45:37.527 --> 45:40.405
You have to stop!
You're gonna kill us!

45:45.743 --> 45:48.371
I can feel the whole world,

45:48.455 --> 45:52.709
every breath and gust

45:52.792 --> 45:55.086
and stone and life.

45:56.129 --> 45:57.380
Everything.

46:13.813 --> 46:18.318
To be a woman is to be
always alone and never alone.

46:19.235 --> 46:21.196
No, no, Nynaeve.
What are you doing? No.

46:21.279 --> 46:23.781
Feel your braid and know
that we all stood before you.

46:23.865 --> 46:25.950
- No.
- We all stand with you.

46:26.034 --> 46:27.202
No!

46:30.622 --> 46:32.207
- No!
-

46:46.304 --> 46:47.847
Nynaeve!

46:52.769 --> 46:54.395
You think
it's a coincidence

46:54.479 --> 46:57.065
that I came to the Two Rivers
every Bel Tine?

46:59.776 --> 47:02.779
That I'd drag myself

47:02.862 --> 47:06.866
up to that sheep shit patch of
nothing just to sell lanterns?

47:06.950 --> 47:08.826
Why?

47:10.370 --> 47:12.914
You're ta'veren.

47:12.997 --> 47:15.667
All five of you,
focal points for the Wheel.

47:18.169 --> 47:22.090
<i>Usually there's only one, maybe
two in a generation, but...</i>

47:23.091 --> 47:25.218
...five of you in one village.

47:26.553 --> 47:27.804
That's what Moiraine saw.

47:28.846 --> 47:30.515
<i>What my Lord saw.</i>

47:33.351 --> 47:35.061
Come on.

47:35.144 --> 47:38.147
That's why we sent the Trollocs,
not to kill you.

47:39.691 --> 47:41.693
To bring you to him.

47:45.071 --> 47:47.490
<i>We need the Dark.</i>

47:47.574 --> 47:49.367
<i>We need balance.</i>

47:51.494 --> 47:55.582
<i>Balance means that you will
turn to the Shadow, some of you.</i>

47:56.583 --> 47:58.710
<i>Maybe all of you.</i>

48:03.798 --> 48:05.508
We can't
go back to Fal Dara.

48:05.592 --> 48:06.593
Not yet.

48:08.553 --> 48:09.971
I'm not going back.

48:11.598 --> 48:12.974
I felt it.

48:15.310 --> 48:17.186
The madness.

48:17.270 --> 48:19.647
It's true, isn't it?

48:19.731 --> 48:21.441
What they say about
men who can channel.

48:21.524 --> 48:23.318
That eventually they go so mad

48:23.401 --> 48:25.320
they kill everyone
they've ever loved.

48:25.403 --> 48:26.863
It is.

48:32.619 --> 48:34.787
I have a favor to ask you.

48:35.830 --> 48:37.540
Just one.

48:40.168 --> 48:41.836
Tell them I died here.

48:44.255 --> 48:46.341
Tell them I didn't make it back.

48:46.424 --> 48:47.967
I cannot lie.

48:48.051 --> 48:49.969
You'll work out a way.

48:50.053 --> 48:51.679
You owe me that much.

48:59.896 --> 49:01.731
Where will you go?

49:04.442 --> 49:06.944
Goodbye, Moiraine.

49:09.280 --> 49:11.574
Today isn't the end.

49:11.658 --> 49:13.493
It's the beginning.

49:15.244 --> 49:18.706
You thought he was defeated.

49:19.666 --> 49:21.751
Ah, there you go.

49:21.834 --> 49:25.171
Tiniest push
and you choose the Dark.

49:27.048 --> 49:29.008
Rand may be the Dragon,

49:29.092 --> 49:32.011
but all five of you
have a part to play.

50:04.210 --> 50:05.837
You're alive.

50:09.173 --> 50:10.591
Where's Rand?

50:16.305 --> 50:18.015
He's gone.

50:22.520 --> 50:24.731
Unmask the bond.

50:24.814 --> 50:26.649
Let me back in.

50:28.443 --> 50:29.861
I can't.

50:31.779 --> 50:33.197
The Dark One.

50:35.158 --> 50:36.576
He...

50:41.122 --> 50:43.332
I can't touch the Source.

51:10.735 --> 51:11.944
Nynaeve.

51:12.028 --> 51:13.821
Come back.

51:15.990 --> 51:17.116
Come back.

52:26.853 --> 52:29.313
It's cuendillar.

52:29.397 --> 52:31.816
I thought that heartstone
couldn't be scratched.

52:32.942 --> 52:35.236
That nothing, not even
the One Power, could break it.

52:35.319 --> 52:36.946
So did I.

52:41.659 --> 52:43.077
What does it mean?

52:47.623 --> 52:49.625
That this wasn't
the Last Battle.

52:54.130 --> 52:56.132
I fear it was the first.
