WEBVTT

00:11.934 --> 00:13.734
MAN:
Sir, I'll take those.

00:15.633 --> 00:17.533
The recruiting event.
(clears throat)

00:17.567 --> 00:20.700
Every year,
Galweather Stearn flies out

00:20.734 --> 00:23.401
the cream of
Harvard Business School's crop

00:23.434 --> 00:25.334
to taste a bit of the good life.

00:25.368 --> 00:26.600
The summer homes.

00:26.633 --> 00:28.533
The $1,000 bottles of wine.

00:28.567 --> 00:31.167
We whet their appetites with
the spoils of our victories,

00:31.201 --> 00:33.034
and after we're done,
after we're sure they've been

00:33.067 --> 00:35.633
good little boys and girls,
we send them on their way

00:35.667 --> 00:37.734
hoping and praying
that their names

00:37.767 --> 00:41.067
will be added to the list,
hoping that one day,

00:41.101 --> 00:44.301
they will be standing
right here.

00:46.767 --> 00:48.734
God, is that Skip?

00:48.767 --> 00:51.134
Motherfucker knows how
to make an entrance, huh?

00:51.167 --> 00:53.034
Marty, what are you
even doing here?

00:53.067 --> 00:54.667
JEANNIE:
Yeah, I thought
you said you'd rather

00:54.700 --> 00:55.900
get jerked off
by Edward Scissorhands

00:55.934 --> 00:57.134
than come to this thing.

00:57.167 --> 00:58.734
I did say that, didn't I?
Hmm.

00:58.767 --> 01:01.201
Yeah, well, I'm here because
Airwolf says he needs me.

01:01.234 --> 01:03.201
Okay, why does Skip
suddenly need you

01:03.234 --> 01:05.200
at a recruiting event?
JEANNIE:
Well, with the merger

01:05.233 --> 01:06.867
on the table, he just wants
to make sure Marty's

01:06.900 --> 01:08.700
going to be
a good little soldier.
Hmm.

01:08.734 --> 01:10.633
Okay, wait a second. Is the
merger definitely happening?

01:10.667 --> 01:12.234
Yeah, really, do you think
we should be worried about it?

01:12.267 --> 01:13.301
Guys, guys, listen.

01:13.334 --> 01:14.800
I'm here because this event

01:14.834 --> 01:17.267
is all about convincing
the prom queen or king

01:17.301 --> 01:19.401
that we're the ones
they want to fuck.

01:19.434 --> 01:21.201
And the best way
to do that is with

01:21.234 --> 01:22.867
the high school
all-star quarterback,

01:22.900 --> 01:24.667
not the AV club.
(imitates
screeching tires)

01:24.700 --> 01:26.734
You, by mistake, lumped
me into the AV club,

01:26.767 --> 01:28.067
'cause you know
that's not me.

01:28.101 --> 01:29.667
I played a little
high school ball.

01:29.700 --> 01:32.067
Kicker?
Why does everybody
shit on the kicker?

01:32.101 --> 01:33.434
'Cause, honestly,
we get tackled, too.

01:33.468 --> 01:35.567
Uh, no, you don't.
Oh, really?

01:35.600 --> 01:37.633
If there's a shitty snap,
that's me on the floor.

01:37.667 --> 01:39.633
Here they come.

01:39.667 --> 01:41.567
(hip-hop music playing)

01:48.067 --> 01:51.867
I think we found your prom date,
Mr. All-Star Quarterback.

01:51.900 --> 01:54.301
I think we have.

01:57.934 --> 02:00.167
For me, it came down
to three real schools, you know?

02:00.201 --> 02:01.633
There's Yale, Wharton
and Harvard.

02:01.667 --> 02:03.633
Now, I chose Harvard
because it's...

02:03.667 --> 02:05.034
Only three schools?
Come on.

02:05.067 --> 02:06.767
A bright young man like you?
I don't believe it.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.600
I'm going to borrow her
for a second. Is that okay?

02:08.633 --> 02:09.866
Sorry.

02:09.900 --> 02:11.401
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

02:11.434 --> 02:13.134
See? That's why I hate
these stupid things.

02:13.167 --> 02:15.734
Yeah, I'd rather get fingered
by Edward Scissorhands.

02:16.767 --> 02:17.934
MAN:
Hey, James, I think

02:17.967 --> 02:19.500
I found the bar.

02:19.533 --> 02:21.633
Not James.
Oh, shit.
I'm sorry.

02:21.667 --> 02:23.201
I thought you were...
Yep, wrong black guy.

02:23.234 --> 02:25.134
No, it's not...
there's somebody...

02:25.167 --> 02:26.767
It's all good.
Oh. Okay.

02:26.800 --> 02:28.834
Okay.

02:28.867 --> 02:30.301
Marty.

02:31.767 --> 02:33.267
Like you to meet...

02:33.301 --> 02:34.734
James,
my brother.

02:34.767 --> 02:36.633
Oh, you two know eother?
Uh, yeah.

02:36.667 --> 02:39.034
From the meetings.
The... the meetings?

02:39.067 --> 02:41.267
Black people meetings.

02:41.301 --> 02:42.434
(laughs, clears throat)

02:44.334 --> 02:45.900
(laughs)

02:45.934 --> 02:47.934
I didn't realize
that that was an actual joke.

02:47.967 --> 02:49.734
That's funny.
James, I want you to meet...

02:49.767 --> 02:51.201
No intro necessary.
This is Marty Kaan.

02:51.234 --> 02:52.533
I'm a huge fan, sir.

02:52.567 --> 02:53.600
I didn't know consultants
had fans.

02:53.633 --> 02:55.167
Jealous?
Marty does.

02:55.201 --> 02:57.767
I thought the innovation engine
you set up for ZCorp

02:57.800 --> 02:59.167
using the Five Pillars approach

02:59.201 --> 03:01.034
was, like, nothing short
of revolutionary.

03:01.067 --> 03:02.368
Oh, thank you.

03:03.468 --> 03:05.301
He's a rebel. (chuckles)

03:05.334 --> 03:07.101
Okay, well, uh...
(clears throat)

03:07.134 --> 03:08.567
I'm going to press
some flesh.

03:08.600 --> 03:09.900
All right.
Excuse me.

03:09.934 --> 03:11.800
Probably thinks we're
going to start talking

03:11.834 --> 03:13.633
in Ebonics now.
Oh, fo' shizzle.

03:14.633 --> 03:15.934
Yeah, boy.

03:15.967 --> 03:18.468
No, ma'am.

03:18.500 --> 03:21.067
(silverware clinks on glass)

03:21.101 --> 03:22.234
(conversation quiets)

03:25.767 --> 03:28.034
Hello, fellow HBS-ers.

03:28.067 --> 03:29.667
(chuckles)

03:29.700 --> 03:32.967
HBS-- that's Harvard
Business School.

03:33.001 --> 03:34.700
'Cause fuck if they're
going to waste

03:34.734 --> 03:37.434
their valuable time
saying that whole thing.

03:37.468 --> 03:38.767
Welcome to my home.

03:38.800 --> 03:43.001
The reason you've all
been asked here is simple.

03:43.034 --> 03:44.301
You're the best at what you do.

03:45.900 --> 03:48.167
You stand out in a crowd.

03:48.201 --> 03:52.034
You... are... elite.

03:52.067 --> 03:53.834
Jesus. You'd think
he was the one

03:53.867 --> 03:55.700
that brought MetroCapital
back from the brink.

03:55.734 --> 03:57.001
Where did you
hear about that?

03:58.034 --> 04:00.468
Told you I'm a fan.

04:01.468 --> 04:03.301
RAINMAKER:
What am I talking about?

04:03.334 --> 04:06.800
I'm talking about one of the
core values of this company.

04:06.834 --> 04:09.633
The motto of our alma mater.

04:09.667 --> 04:14.034
<i>Veritas. Veritas. Veritas.</i>

04:14.067 --> 04:15.067
Truth.

04:15.101 --> 04:17.166
(whispering):
Truth.

04:17.201 --> 04:18.966
That... that...

04:19.000 --> 04:21.500
that is our North Star.

04:28.368 --> 04:30.368
Thank you.

04:31.934 --> 04:33.201
I just find the
whole prospect

04:33.234 --> 04:35.001
of life after grad
school to be so...

04:35.034 --> 04:36.267
daunting.
Daunting.

04:36.301 --> 04:37.700
Exactly.
Yes!

04:37.734 --> 04:39.234
Can I borrow him
for one second?
Wow.

04:39.267 --> 04:40.334
Sure.
Thank you so much.

04:40.368 --> 04:41.567
Hey, man,
this is really important.

04:41.600 --> 04:42.734
Sure.
You're welcome.

04:42.767 --> 04:44.700
Uh, for what?
I hooked us
up with two

04:44.734 --> 04:47.001
of the wait staff girls
for tomorrow night.

04:47.034 --> 04:49.734
Oh... no.
Full disclosure: your
girl's fucking heinous.

04:49.767 --> 04:51.734
What? Clyde.
She's heinous,
but seeing as

04:51.767 --> 04:53.500
you haven't gotten ass
in so long, I figure

04:53.533 --> 04:55.167
heinous vagina is better
than no vagina at all.

04:55.201 --> 04:57.167
Am I right?
You know what I mean?
Yeah, you are right!

04:57.201 --> 04:58.500
Don't high-five that.
Where's that hand been?

04:58.533 --> 05:00.234
Can I please talk
to you for a second?
Yeah.

05:00.267 --> 05:01.934
Excuse us.
Cool.
We're going to go for a walk.

05:01.967 --> 05:04.201
Okay.
Cool.

05:04.234 --> 05:05.800
(chuckling):
Okay, so...

05:05.834 --> 05:07.167
Well, could you
please not talk

05:07.201 --> 05:08.967
to me like that in
front of these people?

05:09.001 --> 05:11.201
No, I think I'm going to keep
doing it for a while.

05:11.234 --> 05:12.834
Clyde, I am probably
going to end up

05:12.867 --> 05:14.301
mentoring one of these kids.

05:14.334 --> 05:17.401
I'd really prefer not to be
associated with heinous vagina.

05:17.434 --> 05:18.500
I am sorry.

05:18.533 --> 05:19.900
Thank you so much.
I... (sighs) Shit.

05:19.934 --> 05:21.334
Do you want me
to cancel the date?

05:21.368 --> 05:22.567
I can do it
in two seconds.

05:22.600 --> 05:23.934
Did I say cancel?

05:23.967 --> 05:26.234
No, I just... not in front
of these potential recruits.

05:26.267 --> 05:28.001
I get it. You don't
have to say any more.

05:28.034 --> 05:29.434
You want these people
to respect you.

05:29.468 --> 05:30.567
Well, yeah,
that'd be nice.

05:30.600 --> 05:31.967
Yeah, maybe impress
one of the partners...

05:32.001 --> 05:34.067
Yes, that's my plan, and
you should be thinking
Yeah.

05:34.101 --> 05:36.468
about that, too.
I am, but I have not
found one person

05:36.500 --> 05:38.767
this entire party that has
a shot at getting on that list.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.934
Okay, well, you're wrong--
they all have a shot.

05:40.967 --> 05:42.734
And you're basing this on what?

05:42.767 --> 05:44.567
Clyde, do you have any idea
how hard it is

05:44.600 --> 05:47.034
to get into Harvard?
Now, that's the school
that you went to?

05:47.067 --> 05:49.301
That's right.
Ooh, fuck, I think
I have some idea, right?

05:49.334 --> 05:51.834
Look, I admit it that some
probably need a little coaching

05:51.867 --> 05:53.101
on their networking
skills, but that's

05:53.134 --> 05:54.967
nothing Doug Guggenheim
couldn't fix.

05:55.001 --> 05:56.267
Doug, are you throwing down?

05:56.301 --> 05:57.600
You know what? I am.

05:57.633 --> 05:59.067
Are you saying
that you can coach

05:59.101 --> 06:01.167
anybody here
onto that list?

06:01.201 --> 06:02.800
Any single body, yes.

06:02.834 --> 06:03.934
Let's go for a walk.
Okay.

06:03.967 --> 06:05.001
Come here for one second.

06:05.034 --> 06:06.401
I want to introduce
you to someone.

06:06.434 --> 06:07.800
Is it Will?
Right? Will?

06:07.834 --> 06:09.234
Will. Will Davis.
We met before. Clyde.

06:09.267 --> 06:10.533
This is my friend, Doug.

06:10.567 --> 06:11.900
Hello.
Do me a favor.

06:11.934 --> 06:13.101
Just show him
real quick

06:13.134 --> 06:14.967
why you think we
should hire you.

06:15.001 --> 06:18.500
Because, Doug,
I can make this company...

06:18.533 --> 06:21.101
money.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.334
So you obviously understand
all the wizardry.

06:27.368 --> 06:28.667
What else
you want to know?

06:28.700 --> 06:29.834
Everything else.

06:29.867 --> 06:31.533
I want to know
everything you know, Marty.

06:31.567 --> 06:32.867
Oh, is that all?
(laughs)

06:32.900 --> 06:35.201
I want you to, you know,
fill in the gaps--

06:35.234 --> 06:37.800
the stuff they don't
teach us in B-school.

06:37.834 --> 06:40.800
Um... okay.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.767
You meet
a prospective client--

06:42.800 --> 06:44.134
what do you do?

06:44.167 --> 06:47.600
Okay.
Um, you establish a personal,

06:47.633 --> 06:50.667
respectful connection
based on a common interest.

06:52.201 --> 06:54.101
Well, you know,
that's a perfect answer, James,

06:54.134 --> 06:55.834
and it is exactly
what you would do

06:55.867 --> 06:57.934
if you're in the 99%
of consultants who are white.

06:57.967 --> 07:00.500
Okay. Okay, so
what do I do?

07:00.533 --> 07:03.368
You gauge his reaction
to the fact that you're black,

07:03.401 --> 07:05.500
and then you use that
to leverage.

07:05.533 --> 07:07.967
We had a guy once
in Vermont-- CEO.

07:08.001 --> 07:10.034
Never met a black guy
in his life, okay?

07:10.067 --> 07:11.734
He was so scared
of being racist,

07:11.767 --> 07:13.401
he just did
whatever I told him.

07:13.434 --> 07:15.234
"Uh, sir, you really
need to stop

07:15.267 --> 07:17.401
making camping gear
and move into titanium dildos."

07:17.434 --> 07:18.834
(laughs)
"Oh, of course, Marty.

07:18.867 --> 07:20.734
That sounds like
a great idea."

07:20.767 --> 07:23.700
You know? Just fuck
that PC pussy, right?

07:23.734 --> 07:25.301
Endless afterwork.

07:25.334 --> 07:26.700
Exactly.
Okay.

07:26.734 --> 07:29.334
Okay, so what about
if it's the... the opposite?

07:29.368 --> 07:31.600
If you got David Duke?
Exactly.

07:31.633 --> 07:33.234
Well, then,
you just smile

07:33.267 --> 07:35.600
and let the other
guy do the talking.

07:35.633 --> 07:38.034
We are here to open
wallets, not minds.

07:38.067 --> 07:40.267
SKIP:
Yeah, well, hope
you're paying attention.

07:40.301 --> 07:42.267
You can learn a lot
from this gentleman.

07:42.301 --> 07:43.567
Absolutely.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.134
Not too many guys

07:45.167 --> 07:46.834
who can cost you
a $10 million account

07:46.867 --> 07:48.167
and still be worth
keeping around,

07:48.201 --> 07:49.867
but that's Marty.
You're making me blush, Skip.

07:49.900 --> 07:52.067
You mind if I steal young
James here for a second?

07:52.101 --> 07:53.700
Some important people
I'd like him to meet.

07:53.734 --> 07:55.101
Sure.
Yeah?

07:56.633 --> 07:59.234
SKIP:
Gentlemen, I'd like you
to meet a new recruit of ours.

07:59.267 --> 08:01.800
This is James.
James...

08:04.500 --> 08:07.468
(laughing)

08:07.500 --> 08:10.567
So, finally,
it just got to the point

08:10.600 --> 08:12.600
I said to the professor
straight-out,

08:12.633 --> 08:14.201
"If I show them to you,

08:14.234 --> 08:16.633
you think you could stop
staring at them in class?"

08:16.667 --> 08:18.667
(laughter)

08:18.700 --> 08:20.101
(laughs)

08:20.134 --> 08:21.500
(sighs)

08:21.533 --> 08:24.434
That was such a good story,
about your boobs.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.567
Um, I have
a real question though.

08:27.600 --> 08:28.600
Sure.

08:28.633 --> 08:29.834
Imagine you...

08:29.867 --> 08:32.167
tied a rope around
the circumference of the earth.

08:32.201 --> 08:34.167
And then you add

08:34.201 --> 08:36.900
three feet to that rope.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.034
How far off the surface
of the earth is it?

08:39.067 --> 08:40.667
(chuckles)

08:40.700 --> 08:42.933
You want me to do
a case right now?

08:42.967 --> 08:45.700
I just want to see
how you think.

08:45.734 --> 08:48.700
(chuckles)

08:50.934 --> 08:52.867
(giggles)
Take your time.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.967
I'll be back.

08:57.900 --> 08:59.700
Having fun?

08:59.734 --> 09:01.533
Not as much fun
as you're having.

09:01.567 --> 09:03.201
Oh, poor Marty.

09:03.234 --> 09:05.633
Must be so hard to have
your ass kissed all night.

09:05.667 --> 09:06.967
(chuckles)

09:07.001 --> 09:08.368
What is this event about?

09:08.401 --> 09:09.934
Fucking the prom queen.

09:09.967 --> 09:11.934
Well, for you, it's about
getting some face time

09:11.967 --> 09:12.934
at the grown-up table.

09:12.967 --> 09:15.934
Now, do you want that?

09:15.967 --> 09:16.934
Yes.

09:16.967 --> 09:18.734
Yes.

09:18.767 --> 09:21.201
Want to make partner someday?

09:21.234 --> 09:22.201
Yes.
Yes.

09:22.234 --> 09:24.567
Then you need to start
kissing the ring.

09:24.600 --> 09:27.301
Or whatever else you want
to put your mouth on.

09:27.334 --> 09:29.301
That's lovely.

09:29.334 --> 09:31.600
(laughter)

09:31.633 --> 09:33.301
Wow.

09:33.334 --> 09:36.067
Powerful businessmen huddled
together smoking cigars.

09:36.101 --> 09:38.468
It's good to see
we're fighting the stereotype.

09:38.500 --> 09:41.500
Don't make me sorry
I invited you, Jeannie.

09:41.533 --> 09:43.633
JAMES: I mean, you guys should
stick with it, really.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.001
It should go better for you.

09:45.034 --> 09:48.567
Are all the recruits invited
up to the sanctum sanctorum

09:48.600 --> 09:50.067
or just James?

09:50.101 --> 09:52.834
I mean, that's my favorite
thing about Galweather.

09:52.867 --> 09:55.633
You know, you guys will come up
with something revolutionary,

09:55.667 --> 09:58.401
like, uh, like Marty
Kaan's brilliant

09:58.434 --> 10:01.134
ZCorp innovation engine,
and then a year later,

10:01.167 --> 10:03.067
you're not beholden
to it, you know,

10:03.101 --> 10:05.101
when it proves itself
to be obsolete.

10:05.134 --> 10:07.834
I mean, most companies will
stick with something like that

10:07.867 --> 10:09.434
even if it is
past its prime,

10:09.468 --> 10:13.034
because it's
unique to them.

10:13.067 --> 10:14.468
But no, you smart
motherfuckers,

10:14.500 --> 10:19.434
you realize when it's time
to move on into the future.

10:19.468 --> 10:21.334
Kid's good.
Yeah.

10:21.368 --> 10:23.600
Let me ask you
something.
Mm-hmm.

10:23.633 --> 10:25.468
What about your future?

10:25.500 --> 10:27.401
I mean, let's just
cut to the chase.

10:27.434 --> 10:29.134
See a future
here with us?

10:29.167 --> 10:32.434
Skip, I could
definitely see that.

10:32.468 --> 10:34.334
Marty.

10:34.368 --> 10:35.500
MARTY:
Yeah?

10:35.533 --> 10:38.134
Just telling James here
how he reminds me

10:38.167 --> 10:39.700
of a young Marty Kaan.

10:39.734 --> 10:41.767
You know, I remember
when you told Nick Cannon

10:41.800 --> 10:43.667
the same exact thing.
(chuckles)

10:43.700 --> 10:45.967
Who the fuck is
Nick Cannon?

10:46.001 --> 10:46.967
(laughter)

10:47.001 --> 10:48.401
Who the fuck is
Nick Cannon?

10:48.434 --> 10:50.201
I have no idea.
You remember Jeannie
Van Der Hooven, right?

10:50.234 --> 10:51.401
Of course I do.

10:51.434 --> 10:52.633
JEANNIE: Hi.
She has been

10:52.667 --> 10:54.001
killing it for
us this year.

10:54.034 --> 10:55.834
Here, come, join me.

10:55.867 --> 10:58.167
James, could I borrow you
for a second?

10:58.201 --> 10:59.134
Oh, yeah.

10:59.167 --> 11:00.401
You don't mind, right, Skip?

11:00.434 --> 11:02.700
Yeah.

11:02.734 --> 11:04.834
I'll leave you two
to get acquainted.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.700
RAINMAKER: Marty says such great
things about you.

11:09.734 --> 11:11.034
JEANNIE:
He does?

11:11.067 --> 11:13.567
DOUG:
Okay, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

11:13.600 --> 11:14.600
Okay, come here.

11:14.633 --> 11:15.600
Come here.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.167
All right, um, okay.

11:17.201 --> 11:18.767
See that guy over there
in the blue checked shirt?

11:18.800 --> 11:19.934
Mm-hmm.
All right, that's
Stuart Anderson.

11:19.967 --> 11:21.368
He's a partner.

11:21.401 --> 11:22.434
Went to Yale.

11:22.468 --> 11:23.900
I want you to tell
him that you wish

11:23.934 --> 11:25.234
you'd gone there
instead of Harvard.

11:25.267 --> 11:26.900
I know that's ridiculous,
but he will lap it up.

11:26.934 --> 11:28.734
Okay, but...

11:28.767 --> 11:30.667
And-And remember, Will,
under no circumstances...

11:30.700 --> 11:31.834
No magic, I got it.

11:31.867 --> 11:34.001
Oh. What about, like,
a tiny bit of magic?

11:34.034 --> 11:35.834
No-- Oh, here he comes.
Come on, come on, come on.

11:35.867 --> 11:37.700
Ah, Stuart!

11:37.734 --> 11:39.633
Stuart Anderson,
I'd really like you to meet

11:39.667 --> 11:40.567
Will Davis.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.368
Hello, Will.
Hi. So Doug tells me

11:42.401 --> 11:43.468
you went to Yale.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.001
Kind of wish
I'd gone there myself.

11:45.034 --> 11:46.167
(laughs):
He's...

11:46.201 --> 11:47.834
Really? Why is that?

11:47.867 --> 11:48.767
Well,

11:48.800 --> 11:51.034
I hear it's a beautiful campus.

11:51.067 --> 11:52.034
Mm.

11:52.067 --> 11:53.533
And that their business school

11:53.567 --> 11:55.134
is really improving.

11:57.667 --> 11:58.734
(sighs)

11:58.767 --> 11:59.934
Nice meeting you.
Likewise.

11:59.967 --> 12:02.101
Doug, pleasure as always.

12:02.134 --> 12:04.067
Stuart, I...
(sighs)

12:04.101 --> 12:06.234
"Doug, pleasure as always."

12:06.267 --> 12:07.533
That didn't seem
to go well.

12:07.567 --> 12:08.533
Just me?

12:08.567 --> 12:09.533
Felt really good to me, Will.

12:09.567 --> 12:10.734
It's fine. It was fine.

12:10.767 --> 12:12.967
I will do better
on the next one.

12:13.001 --> 12:14.500
You know what, um,
on the next one,

12:14.533 --> 12:16.067
let's-let's try one
where you say nothing.

12:16.101 --> 12:17.401
Okay.
Okay? And I'll
do the talking

12:17.434 --> 12:18.934
and you just follow my lead.

12:18.967 --> 12:20.934
If I was you...
No, no, no.

12:20.967 --> 12:22.267
Don't-Don't say anything.
Let's just go.

12:22.301 --> 12:23.533
Do you know any card tricks?

12:23.567 --> 12:25.401
I know lots and lots
of card tricks.
No, no.

12:25.434 --> 12:27.301
No, no magic.
Now is the time.

12:27.334 --> 12:29.134
Bartender, two Johnny
Walker Blues, please.

12:29.167 --> 12:31.468
Two? No, thank you.
I'm good, thank you.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.967
You're good? What,
you religious or something?

12:33.001 --> 12:34.567
No, but I...

12:34.600 --> 12:35.900
You heard Skip up there.

12:35.934 --> 12:37.101
Offer's on the table.
Come on.

12:37.134 --> 12:38.234
Celebrate, baby.

12:41.800 --> 12:43.301
(laughs)

12:43.334 --> 12:44.301
(coughs)

12:44.334 --> 12:45.633
It's even good
when you chug it.

12:45.667 --> 12:47.034
Do that again.
No.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.301
Uh, make mine a
beer, thank you.

12:48.334 --> 12:50.201
No, you don't want
to put beer on top of that.

12:50.234 --> 12:52.101
So sorry to interrupt.

12:52.134 --> 12:53.700
Um, can I see you
for a minute?

12:53.734 --> 12:54.734
Yeah.

12:54.767 --> 12:55.934
Be right back.

12:59.700 --> 13:01.767
So how is the
wine business?

13:01.800 --> 13:04.967
Oh, it's not
a business, Marty.

13:05.001 --> 13:07.600
It's a passion.

13:07.633 --> 13:10.334
Passion that pulls in
seven figures a year.

13:10.368 --> 13:11.867
(laughs)

13:11.900 --> 13:13.900
That's pretty
passionate.

13:18.401 --> 13:20.834
That's the lawyer who handled
my custody hearing.

13:20.867 --> 13:22.101
He's the best in the country.

13:22.134 --> 13:23.201
Give him a call.

13:23.234 --> 13:24.834
How did you...

13:24.867 --> 13:26.633
You really think
that the two top consultants

13:26.667 --> 13:29.401
in the business
can gear up for a custody war,

13:29.434 --> 13:30.800
keep it a secret?

13:30.834 --> 13:33.234
Well, it's not
gonna come to that.

13:33.267 --> 13:34.967
Could.

13:35.001 --> 13:36.567
And if it does,
I'll destroy her.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.633
Great.

13:38.667 --> 13:41.368
But give him a call, please.

13:41.401 --> 13:43.134
Okay?

13:43.167 --> 13:44.334
Yeah, okay.

13:44.368 --> 13:45.934
Appreciate it.

13:45.967 --> 13:50.567
I wish, I wish that was all
I needed to talk to you about.

13:52.633 --> 13:54.201
Pfizer?

13:56.267 --> 13:57.401
Yeah.

13:57.434 --> 13:59.067
Okay.

13:59.101 --> 14:00.700
I fucked up.

14:00.734 --> 14:03.101
Bad time to fuck up, Marty.

14:03.134 --> 14:04.834
'Cause this merger's
going through.

14:04.867 --> 14:05.834
It's official.

14:05.867 --> 14:06.900
Since when?

14:06.934 --> 14:09.067
I just found out.

14:09.101 --> 14:12.500
I think Skip has been
keeping it quiet,

14:12.533 --> 14:13.900
'cause he's afraid
that when you found out,

14:13.934 --> 14:15.101
you'd make some waves.

14:15.134 --> 14:16.834
And he's got the votes.

14:16.867 --> 14:18.667
He told you that?

14:18.700 --> 14:20.101
He didn't tell me shit.

14:20.134 --> 14:22.667
Because he knows
I've got your back.

14:22.700 --> 14:25.468
But, Marty, this merger,
this is happening.

14:25.500 --> 14:29.500
That asshole's up there right
now grooming my replacement

14:29.533 --> 14:34.167
with all the subtlety
of a fucking jackhammer.

14:34.201 --> 14:36.468
Marty, you don't want
this merger to happen, do you?

14:36.500 --> 14:37.834
Hell, no.

14:37.867 --> 14:41.800
So what are we gonna
do about it?

14:43.000 --> 14:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:50.734 --> 14:52.468
Oh, my.

14:52.500 --> 14:53.468
Okay.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.334
(chuckles)

14:55.368 --> 14:56.468
Oh, yeah, this'll work.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.034
(laughs)
This will work!

14:58.067 --> 14:59.401
Yes, sir.

14:59.434 --> 15:02.201
Just wanted you to get
a good look at this

15:02.234 --> 15:05.234
before you consider
other offers.

15:05.267 --> 15:07.201
You've had those, right?

15:07.234 --> 15:09.101
Other offers?

15:09.134 --> 15:10.101
Yeah.

15:10.134 --> 15:13.834
So what are you thinking?

15:13.867 --> 15:15.401
I'm thinking, um,

15:15.434 --> 15:18.101
that there's a hell of a lot
I can learn from you.

15:18.134 --> 15:20.533
Sounds like you made
a decision then.

15:20.567 --> 15:21.900
I guess so.

15:21.934 --> 15:24.667
So, what is this, my
signing bonus? What?

15:24.700 --> 15:26.001
(laughs)

15:26.034 --> 15:27.434
You know what?

15:27.468 --> 15:30.567
With the kind of moves that
Skip's gonna make, about a year,

15:30.600 --> 15:33.067
everybody in the company's
gonna have one of these.

15:33.101 --> 15:34.468
Hey, Marty, tell me the truth.

15:34.500 --> 15:35.800
You really respect the guy?

15:35.834 --> 15:37.401
No.

15:37.434 --> 15:38.767
He's a racist piece of shit.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.234
You know?

15:41.267 --> 15:42.567
But, big picture,
Skip Galweather

15:42.600 --> 15:43.967
really is a fucking genius.

15:44.001 --> 15:45.134
(scoffs)

15:45.167 --> 15:47.734
Oh, that's funny?

15:47.767 --> 15:49.967
Marty, you know I've
met the guy, right?

15:50.001 --> 15:51.700
All right, motherfucker.

15:51.734 --> 15:54.334
You read <i>The Wall</i>
 <i>Street Journal</i> in a
 couple weeks, you'll see.

15:54.368 --> 15:55.468
Oh, yeah?

15:57.700 --> 15:59.468
What'll I see, Marty?

15:59.500 --> 16:02.368
It's not obvious?

16:02.401 --> 16:03.834
Holy shit.

16:03.867 --> 16:07.567
The fucking MetroCapital
merger's gonna happen, isn't it?

16:07.600 --> 16:10.734
You know, you're too damn smart
for your own good, James.

16:10.767 --> 16:12.167
Welcome to the family.

16:12.201 --> 16:14.834
Skip Galweather.

16:14.867 --> 16:18.134
The man that's about to
make us all very, very rich.

16:18.167 --> 16:19.934
Now, see, that's that inner
pucker I'm talking about.

16:19.967 --> 16:22.234
You keep that shit up; Skip
loves it more than I do.

16:22.267 --> 16:23.234
The inner pucker?

16:23.267 --> 16:24.334
Let it bubble.
Let it bubble?

16:24.368 --> 16:26.134
And then let it out.
And then let it out.

16:26.167 --> 16:28.034
(laughs)

16:28.067 --> 16:29.301
Okay. Yeah, no.

16:29.334 --> 16:30.800
I'm gonna keep
looking at you
A lot more.

16:30.834 --> 16:32.134
and thinking what...
Hey, Beth.

16:32.167 --> 16:33.900
Okay.

16:33.934 --> 16:36.234
Sorry we got
interrupted earlier.

16:36.267 --> 16:38.067
Um, you can go ahead and
answer that hypothetical now.

16:38.101 --> 16:39.434
This is so embarrassing.

16:39.468 --> 16:41.034
Jeannie, we're kind of
in the middle of something.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.500
Give it a rest, Clyde.
She's not gonna sleep with you.

16:42.533 --> 16:43.934
She may.

16:43.967 --> 16:45.967
I'm sorry, have I done
something to insult you?

16:46.001 --> 16:47.800
No. No.

16:47.834 --> 16:49.600
I'm just interested.

16:49.633 --> 16:52.700
Because... being charming
and flirtatious

16:52.734 --> 16:54.334
and having those "fuck me" eyes,

16:54.368 --> 16:55.201
it's an asset

16:55.234 --> 16:56.533
in this business.

16:56.567 --> 16:58.533
And would I just like to see
if it's your only asset.

16:58.567 --> 17:03.700
I'm gonna back up a bit
and let the women talk.

17:03.734 --> 17:05.633
I'll give it to you again.
I remember the case.

17:05.666 --> 17:09.334
The rope-- it's about six inches
off the surface of the earth.

17:09.367 --> 17:10.967
Here's how I got there.

17:11.001 --> 17:14.300
The diameter of the Earth equals
the circumference divided by Pi.

17:14.334 --> 17:17.201
So add three feet
to the circumference,

17:17.233 --> 17:20.567
and the diameter increases
by three divided by Pi,

17:20.599 --> 17:23.233
which is approximately
one foot.

17:23.267 --> 17:25.666
Since the diameter is
two times the radius,

17:25.700 --> 17:27.334
you divide that by two,

17:27.367 --> 17:30.101
ending up with about six inches
all around.

17:30.134 --> 17:32.368
I'm impressed.

17:32.401 --> 17:34.401
That's 'cause
my girl's got skills.

17:34.434 --> 17:37.167
See? It is possible

17:37.201 --> 17:39.800
to be attractive,
charming and smart.

17:39.834 --> 17:40.900
(chuckles)

17:40.934 --> 17:43.234
But as far
as the "fuck me" eyes go...

17:44.468 --> 17:46.867
...I guess they're just genetic.

17:48.934 --> 17:50.967
Oh, shit. Jeannie,
that's gotta hurt.

17:51.001 --> 17:52.067
Fuck off, Clyde.

17:52.101 --> 17:53.734
All right, all right.
I gotta get something.

17:53.767 --> 17:54.800
I'll be right back.

17:54.834 --> 17:55.900
Hey, Beth!

17:58.900 --> 18:01.368
Hey, Beth. Hey,
hold on, hold on.

18:01.401 --> 18:03.434
Thanks for helping me
with that answer.

18:03.468 --> 18:04.900
Of course.
Are you kidding me?

18:04.934 --> 18:06.434
Look at her. She's
like the Terminator.

18:06.468 --> 18:08.767
She won't stop
till one of you is dead.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.500
(chuckles)
You're funny.

18:10.533 --> 18:12.600
I'm hilarious.
You got to spend
time with me.

18:12.633 --> 18:13.934
What about tonight?
I'll take you out

18:13.967 --> 18:15.867
to all the L.A. hotspots.
What do you think?

18:15.900 --> 18:18.201
Oh, my God.

18:18.234 --> 18:20.067
You are seriously
the cutest.

18:20.101 --> 18:21.567
I know.

18:22.734 --> 18:23.700
Thanks again.

18:28.401 --> 18:32.533
What... the fuck just happened?

18:35.267 --> 18:38.734
Ah, just the man I wanted
to see, Grant Stevens.

18:38.767 --> 18:41.034
Um, Grant, this is Will Davis.

18:41.067 --> 18:42.800
I thought you might want
to meet Will

18:42.834 --> 18:44.500
because he actually lived in
the Hollis dorms.

18:44.533 --> 18:45.368
Really?

18:45.401 --> 18:46.700
That's right.
So did I.

18:46.734 --> 18:48.101
What'd you think of Hollis?

18:48.134 --> 18:50.267
He loved it. Absolutely
loved it. Couldn't get enough.

18:50.301 --> 18:52.533
Look, Doug, maybe you should let
him speak for himself.

18:52.567 --> 18:53.633
Sure.

18:56.401 --> 18:57.867
Hollis was great.

18:59.567 --> 19:00.767
You join any of the clubs or...?

19:00.800 --> 19:02.800
That's a good question.

19:02.834 --> 19:04.834
No.

19:06.434 --> 19:09.034
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna go.

19:09.067 --> 19:11.101
Well, you know,
I was approached to join

19:11.134 --> 19:13.034
the Hasty Pudding
Theatricals...
What an honor.

19:13.067 --> 19:14.334
...but I decided to focus
on my studies.

19:14.368 --> 19:15.967
Oh, too bad.
Good for you.

19:16.001 --> 19:17.700
Those guys are
the worst.

19:17.734 --> 19:19.201
In what way?
I know, right?

19:19.234 --> 19:21.201
They're just so fucking
theatrical, right?

19:21.234 --> 19:22.800
Jazz hands.
* Be-be-be-be 

19:22.834 --> 19:25.800
Well, it is a theater group.
I don't know what you expect.

19:25.834 --> 19:27.800
You know, they all think
they're the shit

19:27.834 --> 19:29.067
'cause, like,
Jay Leno came

19:29.101 --> 19:30.633
and spoke to
them one time.

19:30.667 --> 19:32.034
Oh, brother.
Two times.

19:32.067 --> 19:33.034
Get over yourself.

19:33.067 --> 19:34.633
You know, Doug here was
a member

19:34.667 --> 19:36.001
of the Hasty Pudding
Theatricals.

19:36.034 --> 19:38.334
Yes, correct.
Oh, shit, really?
Yeah.

19:38.368 --> 19:40.301
That makes total sense.

19:40.334 --> 19:41.567
Which part makes sense?

19:41.600 --> 19:43.301
You're just, like, such
an obvious Pudding guy.

19:43.334 --> 19:44.967
Hey, wait a minute.

19:45.001 --> 19:46.201
Do they still do that thing

19:46.234 --> 19:48.234
where the female roles are
played by guys in drag?

19:48.267 --> 19:50.600
Yeah, it's so creepy.
Isn't it? Ugh!

19:50.633 --> 19:52.834
Just uncomfortable.
It's uncomfortable to look at.
I know.

19:52.867 --> 19:54.134
I always hated that.
Admit it, Doug.

19:54.167 --> 19:56.167
There are pictures of you
somewhere

19:56.201 --> 19:58.234
wearing a dress,
aren't there?

19:58.267 --> 20:00.267
No. No!
There's a few,
aren't there?

20:00.301 --> 20:02.001
Come on. No.
I only played the male parts.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.134
Oh, sure, you did.
I did!

20:03.167 --> 20:04.234
No, Grant, I only
played the male parts.

20:04.267 --> 20:05.667
BOTH:
Shut up, Doug.

20:05.700 --> 20:06.934
What the fuck is happening?
Shut up.

20:06.967 --> 20:08.767
You know they
wear man thongs?

20:08.800 --> 20:10.034
What?
No...

20:10.067 --> 20:11.034
What?!
To hold everything in and up.

20:11.067 --> 20:12.368
Come on.
While they're dancing.

20:12.401 --> 20:13.368
Wrong again.
Who does that?

20:13.401 --> 20:15.600
It's called a "dance belt."

20:18.434 --> 20:20.101
Just FYI.

20:20.134 --> 20:23.767
You know what?
I have a buddy with access

20:23.800 --> 20:24.800
to the Pudding photo archives.

20:24.834 --> 20:26.434
Oh!
I bet we could

20:26.468 --> 20:28.101
dig something...
What's your last name, Doug?

20:28.134 --> 20:29.368
You'd be wasting your time.

20:29.401 --> 20:30.034
Guggenheim.

20:30.067 --> 20:31.034
Great.

20:31.067 --> 20:33.101
Guggenheim him.
Guggenheim me?

20:33.134 --> 20:34.734
People,
he's Guggenheiming.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.134
My name is a verb now?
Guggenheiming it.

20:41.101 --> 20:42.967
How'd it go up there?

20:43.001 --> 20:44.834
Pretty good.
We had an orgy,

20:44.867 --> 20:46.334
and now I'm your boss.

20:46.368 --> 20:47.500
Good.

20:47.533 --> 20:49.234
What are you doing?

20:49.267 --> 20:51.500
I'm just waiting for the
fireworks to start.

20:53.301 --> 20:55.101
In T minus five,

20:55.134 --> 20:57.034
four, three,

20:57.067 --> 21:00.600
two...
Light the candle.

21:00.633 --> 21:03.834
Merger?
Who told you that?

21:03.867 --> 21:05.134
Uh-oh.

21:05.167 --> 21:06.301
I can't trust you.

21:06.334 --> 21:07.700
You hear a rumor,
and then

21:07.734 --> 21:09.633
you just walk around
and just spit it
right in my...

21:09.667 --> 21:10.834
You know what?
Take a walk.

21:10.867 --> 21:13.134
Take a walk!

21:13.167 --> 21:14.967
Take a walk!

21:18.834 --> 21:20.567
What was that about?

21:20.600 --> 21:21.800
I don't know.

21:25.600 --> 21:28.500
I don't, I don't know
what just happened. I...

21:28.533 --> 21:30.267
What?
He told me to go
fuck myself.

21:30.301 --> 21:33.234
I mean, I congratulated him on
the merger going through...

21:33.267 --> 21:34.867
Whoa, whoa.
Where did you hear

21:34.900 --> 21:36.201
that the merger
is going through?

21:36.234 --> 21:37.700
Yeah. That's, that's
news to us, James.

21:37.734 --> 21:38.800
Who told you that?

21:46.301 --> 21:48.700
You... I... You set me up?

21:48.734 --> 21:50.600
MARTY:
Huh?

21:50.633 --> 21:53.967
You fu... you fucking
crab-barrelled me?

21:54.001 --> 21:55.034
James,

21:55.067 --> 21:57.934
you asked for my advice, right?

21:57.967 --> 22:01.767
I mean, you... you fucking
 <i>begged</i> for it.

22:01.800 --> 22:05.067
Well, I just taught you the most
important thing that I know.

22:05.101 --> 22:08.334
You never, ever trust anyone...

22:08.368 --> 22:11.500
until you know their angle.

22:11.533 --> 22:13.700
And now you know.

22:13.734 --> 22:16.734
Now I know.

22:16.767 --> 22:18.468
Thank you for the lesson, Marty.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.834
I'll be sure to take it over
to Kinsley

22:20.867 --> 22:23.034
where I'll be working
with your ex-wife.

22:23.067 --> 22:24.734
Ah, that's it.
That's the spirit.

22:26.700 --> 22:28.201
You have serious issues.

22:28.234 --> 22:30.201
I know!

22:30.234 --> 22:31.734
GRANT:
So, so wait.
At the end

22:31.767 --> 22:33.567
of the Hasty Pudding
show, they do what?

22:33.600 --> 22:35.034
I can't believe we're
still talking about this.

22:35.067 --> 22:37.767
Just give me
a minute, Doug.
They call it
the "kick line."

22:37.800 --> 22:40.600
This year, 12 sexy
bumblebees lined up,

22:40.633 --> 22:41.633
high kicking,
high kicking.

22:41.667 --> 22:43.201
DOUG:
Which is not easy, so, uh...

22:43.234 --> 22:44.234
That's great. Hey.

22:44.267 --> 22:46.267
Have you met Will?
Sure.

22:46.301 --> 22:47.434
Yeah, and what do you think?

22:47.468 --> 22:48.767
Oh, he's fantastic.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.334
Oh, yeah, we're
having a great time.
This guy?

22:50.368 --> 22:51.800
He's fantastic.
Fantastic.
Real connection here, Clyde.

22:51.834 --> 22:53.401
Oh, what are you talking about?
Oh, you know what?

22:53.434 --> 22:54.533
I don't think we have time.

22:54.567 --> 22:55.934
I think they're pulling
the cars up.

22:55.967 --> 22:58.201
They're pulling up...
We have time. We have time.

22:58.234 --> 23:00.401
(cell phone rings)
Wait a second. This might be
my buddy at school.

23:00.434 --> 23:02.867
And... jackpot.

23:02.900 --> 23:04.334
You know what?
Before you say
anything...

23:04.368 --> 23:06.301
Grant, come on.
What is it? Let me see.

23:06.334 --> 23:08.201
The Harvard <i>Crimson</i> described

23:08.234 --> 23:11.101
my performance as
"disturbingly accurate."

23:11.134 --> 23:13.967
Stop, stop. This is it.

23:14.001 --> 23:16.867
This is the best moment
of my life.
I like you, Will.

23:16.900 --> 23:19.334
I really like the way
you opened the kimono

23:19.368 --> 23:20.900
on Doug's journey line.
(imitates deflating balloon)

23:20.934 --> 23:21.967
(laughter)

23:22.001 --> 23:24.468
I want you to meet Skip.

23:24.500 --> 23:25.800
Okay. Who's skip?
Come with me.

23:25.834 --> 23:27.767
Can I get
that phone back?
No, I'm gonna keep it.

23:27.800 --> 23:29.234
Okay, thanks.

23:30.900 --> 23:31.967
(sighs)

23:32.001 --> 23:33.867
Before you say anything,
I won the bet.

23:33.900 --> 23:35.134
Yeah.
So I won that bet.

23:35.167 --> 23:36.900
Sure, right.
Now how does that feel?

23:36.934 --> 23:38.800
Ah, it's a mixed bag.
We're out.

23:38.834 --> 23:39.800
Hold up.
No!

23:39.834 --> 23:40.900
Can you look at this?

23:40.934 --> 23:42.401
Just one second.
Just check it out.

23:42.434 --> 23:44.767
Look at it for real.

23:44.800 --> 23:50.967
(laughing)

23:51.001 --> 23:53.101
CLYDE:
Oh...!

23:53.134 --> 23:54.700
You can't drink
that away.

23:56.101 --> 23:58.301
Hey, what time are we
heading out tomorrow?

23:58.334 --> 23:59.600
We're not, Doug.
What?

23:59.633 --> 24:01.134
Heinous vagina bailed.
Why?

24:01.167 --> 24:02.633
Turns out she's
not into cross-dressers.

24:02.667 --> 24:04.633
Are you serious?!
Why did you show her
that picture?!

24:04.667 --> 24:06.334
I didn't show her
anything.

24:06.368 --> 24:08.334
That shit went viral
so fast.
No, no, no...

24:08.368 --> 24:10.201
You can't stop
a picture that perfect.
Come on.

24:10.234 --> 24:11.667
You can't stop it
(ringtones play)

24:11.700 --> 24:13.468
Oh, my God!
Great.
It's not funny.

24:13.500 --> 24:14.800
Have you seen this yet?

24:14.834 --> 24:16.267
Would you stop showing people?

24:16.301 --> 24:18.734
It's pretty cold what
you did to that kid.

24:18.767 --> 24:21.834
Yeah, maybe I should have just
given him a case to solve.

24:21.867 --> 24:24.633
Oh, don't even
compare those two.
No?

24:24.667 --> 24:27.334
I'm concerned with the quality
of people that we hire.

24:27.368 --> 24:30.201
(laughs)
You are concerned
with getting outshined.

24:30.234 --> 24:31.900
Yeah, well, that must
explain why

24:31.934 --> 24:34.234
I'm such a big
supporter of yours.

24:35.468 --> 24:37.234
That's shitty, Marty,
even for you.

24:37.267 --> 24:39.633
Jeannie, don't
fucking get all...
Hold on a second.

24:39.667 --> 24:41.700
Hey, there he is!
(helicopter engine whining)

24:41.734 --> 24:43.201
The man with the plan.

24:43.234 --> 24:46.034
Sorry, Marty, I got a client
meeting in Palm Springs in 30.

24:46.067 --> 24:48.101
Hey, what about that shit
that kid was running?

24:48.134 --> 24:49.368
That was crazy, right?
Nothing's official.

24:49.401 --> 24:50.667
No, but when
it is official,

24:50.700 --> 24:52.334
I'm sure you're gonna
let me know, right?

24:52.368 --> 24:54.368
You'll write it down
on a piece of paper?

24:54.401 --> 24:55.633
Like, maybe
a pink slip?

24:55.667 --> 24:57.500
What do you want
me to say?

24:57.533 --> 24:58.834
The truth, Skip.

24:58.867 --> 25:02.633
The truth?
Yeah.

25:02.667 --> 25:03.967
The merger's happening.

25:04.001 --> 25:06.034
Okay? How's that?

25:06.067 --> 25:09.234
And any chance that you had
of saving your ass

25:09.267 --> 25:10.700
with K. Warren and
MetroCapital

25:10.734 --> 25:12.368
went down the drain
with Pfizer!

25:12.401 --> 25:14.434
That sober you up?

25:15.800 --> 25:17.567
I'm sorry, Marty.

25:17.600 --> 25:20.034
Really?
You're sorry?

25:20.067 --> 25:21.533
Yeah, kinda.

25:23.201 --> 25:27.700
Don't worry, Marty,
you'll land on your feet.

25:27.734 --> 25:29.334
Fo' shizzle.

25:35.167 --> 25:37.533
Last part didn't sound sorry!

26:11.700 --> 26:13.734
(door closes, keys hit table)

26:16.800 --> 26:20.600
(speed dial tones,
distant phone rings)

26:21.800 --> 26:23.734
(couple panting)

26:25.201 --> 26:26.767
(phone rings)

26:30.334 --> 26:31.434
It's Marty.

26:31.468 --> 26:32.800
For you.

26:32.834 --> 26:34.500
Oh. Give me.

26:36.201 --> 26:37.167
Hey, Marty.

26:37.201 --> 26:39.001
Hey. Did I wake you up?

26:39.034 --> 26:41.234
No. No problem. What's up?
(gasps)

26:41.267 --> 26:42.434
Listen.
Uh-huh?

26:42.468 --> 26:44.800
I wanna gut this motherfucker.

26:44.834 --> 26:47.267
And I wanna look him right in
his fucking eye

26:47.301 --> 26:48.767
when I'm doing it, too.

26:48.800 --> 26:50.567
Uh-huh. Hey, calm down,
calm down.

26:50.600 --> 26:52.567
You know what?
Actually, you know what?

26:52.600 --> 26:54.867
This, this isn't
such a great time.

26:54.900 --> 26:56.500
I'm gonna call you tomorrow.

26:56.533 --> 26:57.600
All right, okay.

26:59.101 --> 27:01.700
What did he want?

27:01.734 --> 27:03.434
Nothing.

27:03.468 --> 27:04.600
Is there anything
going on

27:04.633 --> 27:06.767
with this merger
I should know about?

27:11.301 --> 27:13.633
You're gonna know when I know.

27:15.468 --> 27:17.700
