It's my new
dry conditioner.

01:09.236 --> 01:11.697
A big, giant water penis.

01:12.490 --> 01:14.492
Shut up!
Billie's room ready?

01:14.492 --> 01:16.869
- Cleared a path.
- All right.
It's gotta be perfect,

01:16.869 --> 01:18.913
- 'cause I haven't
seen her since...
- Since Christmas.

01:18.913 --> 01:21.707
You know, you got all week
to catch up with her.

01:21.707 --> 01:23.542
- Uh-huh.
- Which means...

01:23.542 --> 01:24.835
What are you doing?

01:24.835 --> 01:26.545
No! What?

01:27.546 --> 01:28.547
Riley!

01:31.300 --> 01:34.261
Which means I get to
have all my ways with you

01:34.261 --> 01:35.638
- before she gets here.
- No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop.

01:35.638 --> 01:38.015
No, it needs to stay on for
at least eight hours, please.

01:38.015 --> 01:39.391
Okay.

01:39.391 --> 01:40.643
That means
this gets to come off

01:40.643 --> 01:42.019
for at least eight minutes.

01:51.737 --> 01:53.113
Can I at least
keep the goggles on?

01:53.113 --> 01:54.657
They really
ground the look.

01:54.657 --> 01:56.158
Get over here, dickhead.

01:58.369 --> 01:59.370
Hey, boys!

02:00.204 --> 02:01.705
Mind if I drop a line?

02:01.705 --> 02:03.666
Fish are real snappy here.

02:03.666 --> 02:05.459
Yeah.
Yeah, sure thing, Bert.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.712
Go inside?

02:08.712 --> 02:11.423
Um, I'm just
gonna need a minute.

02:13.676 --> 02:15.761
Yeah, you're gonna need
more than a minute.

02:15.761 --> 02:18.013
It's gonna go down faster
if you let go.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.474
No, this is
a hostage situation.

02:24.603 --> 02:26.105
Marry me?

02:26.105 --> 02:28.607
Riley, we've been dating
for what, like, a year?

02:29.525 --> 02:31.819
We can do it this weekend.
Come on, it'd be perfect.

02:32.903 --> 02:35.781
Yeah, like,
perfectly insane.

02:35.781 --> 02:38.200
Riley, I've...
I've been married, remember?

02:38.200 --> 02:40.369
- Just to stay in the country.
- And sex.

02:40.911 --> 02:42.329
And a really
great apartment.

02:42.955 --> 02:44.707
Think about it, all right?
Billie's here.

02:44.707 --> 02:46.625
Look, I know you lost
your place on the lake,

02:46.625 --> 02:48.419
but you can build
a new one here with me.

02:50.629 --> 02:53.340
A tool belt and a proposal
does not make you a lesbian.

02:53.883 --> 02:55.134
A guy can dream.

02:55.134 --> 02:57.261
I don't even know
your middle name.

02:57.970 --> 02:58.804
Blair.

02:59.805 --> 03:02.016
Oh, my God,
you are a lesbian.

03:06.270 --> 03:07.354
This is crazy.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.565
When has that
ever stopped you?

03:12.192 --> 03:13.444
- Okay.
- Yeah?

03:13.986 --> 03:15.738
- Okay.
- Okay? Yeah, do you?

03:15.738 --> 03:16.906
I do.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.526
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:55.027 --> 03:58.030
Your kicks are way too fresh
to be a tree planter.

03:58.030 --> 04:00.115
Oh, I'm just visiting family
for the week.

04:00.115 --> 04:02.201
Shit. I needed a place to hide

04:02.201 --> 04:03.744
from all the acoustic guitar
this summer.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.245
Oh, a lot of
"Wonderwall," huh?

04:05.245 --> 04:07.122
Uh, kombucha?

04:07.122 --> 04:08.582
I brewed it myself.

04:08.582 --> 04:09.708
Yeah, sure.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.085
Why not?

04:12.586 --> 04:14.546
You know, my mom says
that good gut flora

04:14.546 --> 04:16.966
is a better predicator
of future income than grades.

04:16.966 --> 04:19.510
- No shit.
- Well, I mean, a little shit.

04:24.390 --> 04:27.184
Well, I am Forrest.
Two "R"s.

04:27.184 --> 04:28.060
Oh, Billie.

04:28.060 --> 04:29.770
Uh, two "L"s.

04:38.487 --> 04:40.155

Cute?

04:40.155 --> 04:42.282
- Too needy?
- No, you look good.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.575
- All right?
- Okay.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.869
Here she is. Billie!

04:46.453 --> 04:47.454
Text me.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.373
- Will do.
- Okay.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.334
Hi!

04:55.004 --> 04:56.505
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:56.505 --> 04:57.881
I see you're
making new friends.

04:57.881 --> 04:59.133
- Hi, Riley.
- Hi.

05:00.175 --> 05:02.011
- Let me grab these for you.
- Thanks.

05:03.512 --> 05:05.264
So, what's with
all the dirty hippies?

05:05.264 --> 05:07.057
They're tree planters, Justin.

05:07.057 --> 05:08.642
Oh, even worse.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.227
Stay upwind.
Patchouli will give you bacne.

05:11.937 --> 05:12.771
Bye.

05:13.439 --> 05:15.024
Hi. I'm still here.

05:15.024 --> 05:16.108
- Hi.
- Another hug?

05:16.108 --> 05:16.984
Yes.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.031
- I missed you like stupid.
- Me too.

05:24.783 --> 05:26.326
Why do you smell
like moonshine?

05:26.326 --> 05:28.287
That's kombucha.
It's home brew.

05:29.288 --> 05:30.622
It's good!

05:30.622 --> 05:31.915
The hippies got to you.

05:31.915 --> 05:33.500
Just a bit.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.295
Seven-layer lasagna?
Is that really necessary?

05:36.295 --> 05:38.422
I thought we'd discussed
the menu for tonight.

05:38.422 --> 05:39.923
Classic with a twist.

05:39.923 --> 05:42.676
Nana thinks hot dogs
with chorizo and glazed pears

05:42.676 --> 05:45.345
- is trying too hard.
- Well, your mother thinks...

05:45.345 --> 05:46.972
That her mother knows

05:46.972 --> 05:49.308
that street meats
taste best drunk

05:49.308 --> 05:51.727
behind CBGB's
after 4:00 a.m.

05:53.270 --> 05:55.022
I have news

05:55.773 --> 05:59.026
that's gonna sweeten
that sour puss of yours.

06:00.235 --> 06:01.904
I was just
speaking to Killian.

06:01.904 --> 06:04.406
- Killian called?
- Mmm. On your phone, yes.

06:04.406 --> 06:06.200
Why didn't you
hand it to me?

06:06.200 --> 06:07.826
'Cause I'm not your roadie,

06:07.826 --> 06:09.912
and I was dying to know
if he took the job.

06:09.912 --> 06:11.371
Killian's lifeguarding
this summer.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.707
- He has a job.
- Well, a friend of mine

06:13.707 --> 06:16.168
who I used to life model with
at the Vatican

06:16.168 --> 06:18.629
owns an agency
in Hong Kong.

06:18.629 --> 06:20.589
And after I posted
a picture of Killian,

06:20.589 --> 06:21.924
she reached out.

06:23.175 --> 06:24.593
Our boy, a model?

06:25.427 --> 06:26.678
It only makes sense.

06:28.305 --> 06:30.182
Killian's leaving
China next week.

06:30.182 --> 06:32.601
We can't impose
on your family any more.

06:32.601 --> 06:34.937
I mean, I'm sure
they'd love to have him.

06:34.937 --> 06:36.063
Be back for school.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.564
Think of the doors

06:37.564 --> 06:39.942
that modelling
would open for Killian.

06:39.942 --> 06:42.111
Acting, music,

06:42.111 --> 06:44.738
a sexy rebound with
the Chairman of the Party.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.490
My sister
would never let that happen.

06:48.951 --> 06:50.536
I think I need more coffee.

06:51.829 --> 06:55.916
Children need dysfunction
to turn into interesting adults!

06:58.418 --> 06:59.628
Maisers?

07:00.671 --> 07:02.881
Or they end up
with hobbies.

07:08.846 --> 07:11.181
Is breakfast wine the best way
to deal with your mom?

07:11.181 --> 07:12.516
Oh, I just need the bottle.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.145
Oops! Clumsy me.

07:16.854 --> 07:19.273
It's accidental manslaughter
if she trips on it.

07:19.273 --> 07:20.732
The blood thinners
will do the rest.

07:20.732 --> 07:21.817
Sorry, Maisers.

07:22.651 --> 07:24.153
Can't let you
kill your mom.

07:24.153 --> 07:25.737
You see?
This is what she does.

07:25.737 --> 07:27.781
She wraps you around
her jabby little fingers

07:27.781 --> 07:29.533
and then skips off
to Zipolite.

07:29.533 --> 07:31.118
She already has
her claws in our kids.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.579
- I need you on my side!
- I am on your side.

07:33.579 --> 07:35.080
She answers my phone.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.790
She batiked
my French linens.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.709
She turned the bunkie
into an ashram!

07:38.709 --> 07:39.918
We need our own place.

07:39.918 --> 07:41.670
Look, babe,
all the places you liked

07:41.670 --> 07:43.297
are over our budget,
I'm retired,

07:43.297 --> 07:46.425
and you lost
the home reno account.

07:46.425 --> 07:47.885
Besides,
your mom isn't that bad,

07:47.885 --> 07:49.344
and the kids
love this place.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.096
Why isn't Killian
coming home?

07:51.930 --> 07:54.516
Because he has a duty to
share the face, body, and hair

07:54.516 --> 07:56.185
I gave him
with the world.

07:56.185 --> 07:58.729
Maisy-May,
do you have any Turkish beans?

07:58.729 --> 08:00.981
- Yours are limp.
- Oh, here I go.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.066
No!

08:24.046 --> 08:27.090
- Uh, home sweet...
- Homicide.

08:28.634 --> 08:31.220
Wow, I like what you've done
with the place, Rile.

08:31.220 --> 08:33.222
Yeah, it's still
a work in progress.

08:33.222 --> 08:34.806
Sorry about the mess.

08:34.806 --> 08:36.600
I'm workin' on a new roadkill
investigation series.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.477
He uses the living room
'cause the light's better,

08:38.477 --> 08:40.896
but these little cuties,
they really come to life

08:40.896 --> 08:42.689
- in the dark.
- Mmm.

08:42.689 --> 08:44.733
Yeah, 'cause someone's
afraid to pee at night.

08:44.733 --> 08:46.944
They watch.

08:46.944 --> 08:49.321
So this dinner
thing at Maisy's...

08:49.321 --> 08:52.032
I know. She blackmailed
us into coming for moral support

08:52.032 --> 08:53.617
because her mom's
staying with her for the week

08:53.617 --> 08:55.661
until Killian
gets back from China, so...

08:55.661 --> 08:58.038
You're safe.
It's just Maisy, Victor,

08:58.038 --> 09:00.165
Opal, and the evil stepmonster.

09:00.165 --> 09:03.418
Already finishing each other's
sentences. Adorable!

09:07.798 --> 09:09.341
Are you bummed that Killian
won't be there?

09:09.341 --> 09:11.260
Nah.
That boy's last year's news.

09:11.260 --> 09:13.303
Ooh.

09:13.303 --> 09:14.554
- So...
- Mm-hmm.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.181
...what's Mimsy like?

09:16.181 --> 09:20.060
A narcissistic,
manipulative Messy Poppins.

09:21.770 --> 09:23.188
How come Wayne and Jayne
aren't coming?

09:23.188 --> 09:24.398
Uh,

09:24.398 --> 09:25.857
yeah, Maisy's
been avoiding Jayner

09:25.857 --> 09:27.276
since she declared
for Boathouse prezzie.

09:27.943 --> 09:29.403
- And the Quads?
- Wayne and Jayne

09:29.403 --> 09:31.113
are sharing custody
since the split.

09:31.113 --> 09:33.699
Yeah, it's Wayne's weekend,
so they're probably moving

09:33.699 --> 09:35.659
their beds to the other side
of the cottage.

09:48.880 --> 09:49.881
I'm here!

09:51.216 --> 09:52.217
Hey.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.011
Whoo!

09:55.429 --> 09:57.014
Ready for our weekend, girls?

09:57.014 --> 09:59.474
- Daddy, line!
- Right.

09:59.474 --> 10:01.810
Mom will freak if you go
on her side before five.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.941
You know,
it is my cottage too.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.443
Do you think
this is easy for us?

10:09.443 --> 10:10.569
Look at Olive.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.156
- She seems fine.
- She gave up weed.

10:14.156 --> 10:15.907
My sweet baby girl!

10:16.533 --> 10:18.618
- Daddy! Line!
- Yeah.

10:19.745 --> 10:21.246
Why's your mom so mad?

10:21.246 --> 10:22.664
I gave her
everything she wanted.

10:22.664 --> 10:24.207
Except the cottage.

10:24.207 --> 10:26.001
And you traded her boat
for that stupid seaplane.

10:26.001 --> 10:27.294
Which you can't even fly.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.379
Anyway, don't even
worry about it, girls.

10:29.379 --> 10:31.590
By the end of the summer,
me and your mom,

10:31.590 --> 10:33.258
we're gonna be back together.

10:33.258 --> 10:34.718
It's a Wayne Moore guarantee.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.305
Not if you keep day drinking
in cargo shorts.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.639
The whole point
of breaking up

10:39.639 --> 10:41.808
is to show your ex
how much hotter you got.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.685
- Mom's blowing up on Hinge.
- And Tinder.

10:43.685 --> 10:44.978
- Bumble.
- Plenty of Fish.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.146
- Coffee and a Bagel.
- Snack.

10:46.146 --> 10:46.980
I'm hungry.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.211
Thank you
for having us, Mimsy.

11:09.211 --> 11:11.713
Happy to have you anytime.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.885
Can't believe you reopened
Granny's Muskoka room.

11:16.885 --> 11:18.887
Well, we finally found
the source of that smell.

11:18.887 --> 11:21.264
- Oh, my God, what was it?
- Your granny.

11:21.264 --> 11:23.975
Now, no sniping.
We're celebrating.

11:23.975 --> 11:26.436
Everyone together
around the table again.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.897
If only your father
were here to see it.

11:28.897 --> 11:30.690
He did love corn.

11:31.441 --> 11:34.778
Derrick lost so much sleep
over your beautiful Billie

11:34.778 --> 11:37.572
being raised by
strangers or homosexuals.

11:37.572 --> 11:39.366
He'd be thrilled to see

11:39.366 --> 11:41.493
how perfectly ordinary
you turned out.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.206
Actually,

11:46.206 --> 11:49.376
Billie has some of the top marks
in the province.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.253
And, Riley,
drumroll please...

11:52.212 --> 11:54.047
...just got an internship

11:54.047 --> 11:55.549
with the National
Climate Institute,

11:55.549 --> 11:57.259
where she will be
saving the planet this summer,

11:57.259 --> 11:58.593
because your generation
has used it as

11:58.593 --> 12:00.095
a disposable snot rag
for decades.

12:00.095 --> 12:01.805
- Okay, also yours.
- Little bit less.

12:01.805 --> 12:03.306
Well, now I know

12:03.306 --> 12:06.560
that I have three
extraordinary grandchildren.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.520
Congratulations, Billie.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.021
Congratulations.

12:10.021 --> 12:10.981
I'm proud of you.

12:12.983 --> 12:14.067
Uh,

12:15.068 --> 12:17.696
I would also like
to make a family toast,

12:17.696 --> 12:20.031
seeing as I'll be
joining it soon.

12:20.031 --> 12:22.492
I asked Justin to marry me,

12:23.160 --> 12:24.578
and he said yes.

12:25.871 --> 12:28.248
- Congratulations! That's...
- Congrats.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.167
- Wow! Wow, wow, wow.
- That's great.

12:30.167 --> 12:31.376
I did, I said yes.

12:31.376 --> 12:34.087
Have you set a date yet?

12:34.087 --> 12:35.714
- Yeah, we were thinking...
- Tomorrow.

12:35.714 --> 12:37.257
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.592
We know that's fast.

12:38.592 --> 12:40.969
It's fast,
but Riley hates fuss,

12:40.969 --> 12:42.429
Billie's only in town
for a week.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.055
We were just thinking,
like, "You know what?

12:44.055 --> 12:46.141
To hell with it, let's just
throw caution to the wind.

12:46.141 --> 12:48.143
- Let's do it."
- Yeah, then you can just

12:48.143 --> 12:51.062
forget about the shitty DJs
and the horrible food,

12:51.062 --> 12:52.939
and the... you know,
the gift bullshit.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.441
Although we wouldn't say no
to a Vitamix.

12:54.441 --> 12:55.984
Well, where are you
getting married?

12:55.984 --> 12:58.403
I've eloped three times,
and venue is everything.

12:58.403 --> 13:00.280
We were hoping
the Boathouse?

13:00.280 --> 13:02.616
My great-grandfather was one
of the original carpenters,

13:02.616 --> 13:04.284
but it's booked.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.411
So we were actually kind of
hoping to maybe do it here.

13:06.411 --> 13:08.288
You know,
like my parents did?

13:09.122 --> 13:11.500
You can't consecrate
your love on land

13:11.500 --> 13:13.502
steeped in
your parents' sexual ennui.

13:14.544 --> 13:16.546
Maisy can get you
the Boathouse.

13:16.546 --> 13:18.590
Her best friend,
Janine, is VP.

13:18.590 --> 13:21.551
- Jayne and I aren't really...
- Do you have a wedding planner?

13:21.551 --> 13:25.639
Oh. Uh, well, we were just
gonna ask Ulrika to officiate.

13:25.639 --> 13:26.932
I can work with that.

13:30.185 --> 13:32.521
I need everyone
at the Boathouse by ten.

13:32.521 --> 13:35.106
Check your inbox in the morning
for your assignments.

13:35.607 --> 13:37.108
Where did
the earpiece come from?

13:37.108 --> 13:38.485
You guys are
getting hitched tomorrow,

13:38.485 --> 13:40.111
that means
bachelor party tonight.

13:42.072 --> 13:44.866
Oh, Riley and Justin can't see
each other before the wedding,

13:44.866 --> 13:47.702
it's bad luck,
so I can throw a bachelorette

13:47.702 --> 13:49.788
- for Justin at the cabin.
- Thank you.

13:49.788 --> 13:51.790
A toast.
To the grooms.

13:52.457 --> 13:54.251
May your life together

13:54.251 --> 13:56.962
be as happy as
the one leaving me.

13:58.964 --> 14:01.007
- Leaving you?
- I'm dying.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.884
I was gonna wait
to tell you,

14:02.884 --> 14:05.762
but then Justin and Riley's
desperate cry for attention

14:05.762 --> 14:07.264
inspired my own.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.474
To the grooms!

14:13.603 --> 14:15.313
I mean,
she could've waited.

14:15.313 --> 14:17.357
She's still gonna be dying
after the wedding.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.276
Are you sure
about this, though?

14:19.276 --> 14:21.486
'Cause it's really fast, Justin.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.613
Billie,
if you'd seen him propose.

14:23.613 --> 14:24.948
He was like this...

14:25.949 --> 14:28.034
big, wet puppy.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.537
Yeah, but you get a puppy.
You don't marry one.

14:31.538 --> 14:32.372
Listen.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.792
I lost a lot of time

14:35.792 --> 14:37.335
being away from
the people that I love,

14:37.335 --> 14:38.753
and I don't wanna make
that mistake again.

14:39.921 --> 14:41.131
I love Riley.

14:41.965 --> 14:44.801
And Riley loves me.
And I know that it's fast,

14:44.801 --> 14:46.970
but if I was a 36-year-old
divorced woman

14:46.970 --> 14:48.930
with a biological clock
screaming "Tick, tock,"

14:48.930 --> 14:50.515
then nobody
would bat an eye.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.895
I've got everything
that I've always wanted.

14:56.688 --> 14:59.024
Except a father
to walk me down the aisle.

14:59.024 --> 15:01.026
You asking me
to be your dad

15:01.026 --> 15:03.278
- or walk you down the aisle?
- Oh, you don't have to choose.

15:03.278 --> 15:04.904
You just gotta find me
something to wear.

15:07.782 --> 15:08.825
Hey, girlies.

15:09.618 --> 15:12.037
Now, it is not a bachelorette

15:12.037 --> 15:14.164
without skinny margaritas.

15:14.164 --> 15:15.582
No, it is not.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.210
Good news!
I was able to bump

15:19.210 --> 15:21.004
Whoreen's canasta tournament

15:21.004 --> 15:22.714
to get you
the Boathouse tomorrow!

15:22.714 --> 15:24.049
Are you serious?

15:25.967 --> 15:28.595
Bad news,
couldn't find a stripper,

15:28.595 --> 15:30.138
so Saggy B
is hoistin' 'em up,

15:30.138 --> 15:31.973
and we are not gonna want
to remember that.

15:31.973 --> 15:34.434
So, strap in,

15:35.310 --> 15:37.854
and tell me
where I can plug 'er in.

16:07.676 --> 16:11.471
Oh, looks like the bachelorette
party was a success.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.181
Just gotta push
through the pain.

16:14.015 --> 16:15.517
How's the hunt
for a new cottage?

16:15.517 --> 16:17.143
We're still looking,

16:17.143 --> 16:19.145
but I am chatting
with Clementine Farnsworth.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.940
Ooh! She was Brenda Butt
when we got our license,

16:21.940 --> 16:24.150
but Clementine
can ask for 7%.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.569

Hey, Mimsy,
can I count on your vote

16:31.449 --> 16:32.867
for Boathouse president
this year?

16:33.743 --> 16:36.329
I would ask for yours,
but, whoopsie,

16:36.329 --> 16:38.123
you can't vote, so...

16:45.213 --> 16:47.757
- Need a hand there, Wayner?
- Nah.

16:49.884 --> 16:51.928

16:51.928 --> 16:54.764

a thousand tiny lights?

16:55.557 --> 16:56.766

16:57.434 --> 16:59.352
Well, I live in a plane
I can't fly.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.813
Uh, I don't have a shower
to drink in anymore.

17:01.813 --> 17:03.523
But you can't live
in the past.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.900
Oh, hey, can I do some laundry
at your house again?

17:05.900 --> 17:08.236
Jaynie's got the machines
tied up till Saturday,

17:08.236 --> 17:09.738
and girls said
I could use a glow-up.

That's okay. That's okay!
We'll tell them it was too fast,

19:18.825 --> 19:20.827
and we'll go home and talk,
and Riley will understand.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.413
I did that thing: I made
this whole week about myself.

19:23.413 --> 19:24.706
This was supposed
to be your week.

19:24.706 --> 19:26.082
I made it all about me.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.710

in marriage.

20:24.015 --> 20:26.893
We ask Baldur,
god of all ass rascals,

20:26.893 --> 20:31.064
to bless their coffers with gold
and their staffs with semen.

20:33.691 --> 20:34.943

20:34.943 --> 20:37.320
Riley,
you may speak your vows.

22:41.194 --> 22:44.072
What kind of ding-dong brings
fireworks into the Boathouse?

22:44.072 --> 22:46.115
I told him
to take them outside.

23:13.601 --> 23:15.770
Justin...

23:18.648 --> 23:20.441
What have you done?

23:34.288 --> 23:36.958
Hey, guys. Guys,
the Boathouse is on fire.

23:36.958 --> 23:39.127
We know.
The fire department's there.

23:39.127 --> 23:40.503
Oh.

23:41.712 --> 23:43.756
- They're all gone.
- Oh, my God!

23:43.756 --> 23:45.550
Everyone's safe, but...

23:46.342 --> 23:48.636
Riley's RKI collection
died in the fire.

23:49.220 --> 23:51.097
Well, you know, technically,

23:51.097 --> 23:52.849
I mean, they were
already kind of dead, but...

23:53.891 --> 23:55.560
Right. I know.

24:00.523 --> 24:01.774
Not all are gone.

24:05.153 --> 24:06.529
You could've said no.

24:08.531 --> 24:10.658
I wanted to marry you.

24:11.284 --> 24:12.785
I wanna marry you.

24:13.369 --> 24:15.788
You could've just said no.

24:24.172 --> 24:26.757
Billie can stay here,
but I want you to go.

24:28.176 --> 24:29.886
I don't wanna see you
in the morning.

24:38.769 --> 24:40.938
Justin, what happened?

24:40.938 --> 24:42.440
I don't know!

24:42.440 --> 24:44.108
I don't know.
Everything was perfect,

24:44.108 --> 24:46.694
and then I just,
like, blacked out,

24:46.694 --> 24:49.322
and then I woke up
running in the forest.

24:50.615 --> 24:52.783
I'm such an idiot.

24:52.783 --> 24:54.827
No, it's gonna be okay.

24:55.786 --> 24:57.997
First, we need to find
a place to sleep, yeah?

24:59.582 --> 25:01.083
You can stay here
with Riley.

25:02.043 --> 25:04.462
Ulrika's next door.
I can just camp out in her yurt.

25:04.462 --> 25:05.880
Oh, I wouldn't count on that.

25:06.839 --> 25:08.841
I don't know,
I guess I can, um...

25:09.800 --> 25:11.219
guess I can ask Maisy.

25:14.889 --> 25:16.641
On the bright side,

25:16.641 --> 25:18.935
I won't be in the bedroom next
to you on your wedding night.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.146
I'm such an idiot.

25:22.146 --> 25:24.106
No,
we'll figure it out, okay?

25:28.277 --> 25:29.779
We'll figure it out.

25:33.115 --> 25:35.076
Are we gonna talk
about your mom dying?

25:35.618 --> 25:36.911
She's not dying.

25:37.495 --> 25:39.997
Usually you blow past
denial right into anger.

25:39.997 --> 25:41.415
Maybe Wayner was right.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.626
Can't get stuck
in the past.

25:44.585 --> 25:45.670
Who was that?

25:46.420 --> 25:48.422
Sorry.
Need to replenish.

25:48.422 --> 25:50.633
The smoke desiccated
my vocal cords.

25:51.676 --> 25:53.803
- Good night, sweetie.
- Love you, bud.

25:55.805 --> 25:57.682
Hon, do you have

25:57.682 --> 25:59.100
any coconut kefir?

26:00.268 --> 26:01.644
It's okay.

26:01.644 --> 26:03.604
I'll make do with goat.

26:03.604 --> 26:05.064
I don't care
how much it costs,

26:05.064 --> 26:06.816
we cannot spend
another minute here.

26:06.816 --> 26:09.110
No.

26:09.110 --> 26:12.029
Damn raccoons are back.

26:13.614 --> 26:15.533
There's the anger.
Let it out!

26:15.533 --> 26:17.785
I may not be able to
chase my mom from my cottage,

26:17.785 --> 26:20.037
but I can chase raccoons
from my porch.

26:20.997 --> 26:23.082
What do you think about
"kefir" as a safe word?

26:26.544 --> 26:29.005
I have nowhere else
to sleep, and everyone hates me.

26:29.005 --> 26:30.881
Mmm. You surprised?

26:30.881 --> 26:33.426
Your <i>Runaway Bride</i> reboot
set the Boathouse on fire.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.095
Just do it.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.680
Be a hero.

26:37.680 --> 26:40.141
Can't say that I haven't
fantasized about it,

26:40.141 --> 26:44.186
but sleeping on my mom's pullout
really kills the buzz.

26:44.186 --> 26:46.397
It's not gonna be your mom's
for much longer.

26:46.397 --> 26:49.066
Cottage is gonna be yours
once Mimsy goes.

26:49.066 --> 26:50.359
Maisy wins.

26:50.359 --> 26:51.444
Again.

26:51.444 --> 26:54.155
She's had cancer before.

26:54.155 --> 26:56.490
Facial dysphasia,
phantom rosacea.

26:56.490 --> 26:58.784
Isn't that how she got
spider Botox through customs?

26:58.784 --> 27:01.037
She couldn't talk for six weeks.
It was heaven.

27:01.037 --> 27:02.330
Yeah.

27:04.915 --> 27:06.584
Unless she really is sick.

27:06.584 --> 27:08.502
Then her timing is perfect.

27:08.502 --> 27:10.379
Killian is about to
start his senior year.

27:10.379 --> 27:13.549
I need a vegan celebrity for
the Impossible Burger collab.

27:13.549 --> 27:15.593
Opal is interviewing
at La Scala.

27:16.761 --> 27:18.804
You gotta hand it to Dad
for just dropping dead

27:18.804 --> 27:20.723
- the way he did.
- He's not your dad.

27:20.723 --> 27:21.974
Sorry.

27:26.020 --> 27:27.688
Listen, Maisy,

27:27.688 --> 27:30.566
I wasn't around for Dad's
"Come to PFLAG" moment, but...

27:31.776 --> 27:33.235
this might be
your last chance

27:33.235 --> 27:35.529
to scratch under
your mom's lizard skin.

27:35.529 --> 27:37.114
See if there's
a human under there.

27:37.114 --> 27:38.866
Or another lizard.

27:39.658 --> 27:43.204
She found Killian a job,
but she now has time for Opal?

27:43.204 --> 27:44.747
She invited you to dinner?

27:45.748 --> 27:47.291
She's not sick.
She's got an angle.

27:47.291 --> 27:48.793
I just have to
figure out what.

27:51.962 --> 27:53.422
What are you gonna do now that

27:53.422 --> 27:54.924
you set fire to
everyone's summer?

27:55.633 --> 27:56.759
Gonna fix it.

27:57.802 --> 27:59.303
I am. I'm gonna fix it.

27:59.303 --> 28:00.846
I am not gonna
leave the lake

28:00.846 --> 28:03.307
until I give Riley
the happy ending he deserves.

28:03.307 --> 28:04.141
The other one.

28:05.017 --> 28:05.893
Oh.

28:06.936 --> 28:08.020
Dealer's choice.

28:11.732 --> 28:13.526
Do we hug?
We don't hug.
