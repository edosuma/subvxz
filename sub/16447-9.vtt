WEBVTT

00:02.874 --> 00:05.374
Thank you very much.
Thanks.

00:05.376 --> 00:06.476
LEONARD:
That is unbelievable.

00:06.478 --> 00:07.710
Good for Bert.

00:07.712 --> 00:10.213
Damn, the MacArthur
Genius Grant.

00:10.215 --> 00:11.714
Couldn't have happened
to a nicer guy.

00:11.716 --> 00:14.484
Everything is stupid
and I want to go home.

00:15.487 --> 00:17.386
That's Sheldon's way of saying

00:17.388 --> 00:18.621
he's proud of Bert, too.

00:18.623 --> 00:19.889
Ah.

00:19.891 --> 00:21.824
Hey, it's not even called
the "Genius Grant,"

00:21.826 --> 00:23.626
it's the MacArthur Fellowship.

00:23.628 --> 00:25.761
Just like it's
not Frankenstein,

00:25.763 --> 00:26.963
it's "Frankenstein's Monster."

00:26.965 --> 00:27.930
Which brings us back

00:27.932 --> 00:29.932
to that hulking
simpleton over there.

00:31.803 --> 00:33.069
And if anyone's a genius,

00:33.071 --> 00:34.937
it's me for the way
I brought that full circle.

00:36.875 --> 00:38.107
How much money did he win?

00:38.109 --> 00:39.342
Over half a million dollars.

00:39.344 --> 00:40.843
- Wow.
- And he doesn't have to use it

00:40.845 --> 00:43.146
for research, he can do
whatever he wants with it.

00:43.148 --> 00:46.649
Oh, good, maybe he can build
a nicer bridge to live under.

00:47.585 --> 00:49.152
Here he comes.
Right.

00:49.154 --> 00:50.119
Be polite.

00:50.121 --> 00:51.320
I know how to behave.

00:51.322 --> 00:52.588
Do you?

00:52.590 --> 00:54.590
Hey,
congratulations Bert!

00:54.592 --> 00:55.791
Yeah, good for you.
That's amazing.

00:55.793 --> 00:56.759
Thanks.

00:56.761 --> 00:58.794
I was as surprised as anybody.

00:58.796 --> 00:59.795
When they called
and told me

00:59.797 --> 01:01.264
I won, I didn't believe them.

01:01.266 --> 01:03.399
And then they said,
"No, you really won."

01:03.401 --> 01:06.335
And then I said, "Cool."

01:06.337 --> 01:08.838
Someone call
George R. R. Martin,

01:08.840 --> 01:11.140
this guy knows how
to finish a story.

01:11.142 --> 01:14.377
I've gotten pretty good
at telling it.

01:15.580 --> 01:17.013
Well, see ya.

01:18.082 --> 01:19.448
Some genius.

01:19.450 --> 01:22.385
I zinged him with sarcasm,
he didn't even notice.

01:23.254 --> 01:24.487
I know, and it was

01:24.489 --> 01:26.656
the greatest sarcastic
quip I've ever heard.

01:26.658 --> 01:29.859
Well, aren't you a peach.

02:00.749 --> 02:02.649
Who leaves their bike
in the hallway?

02:02.651 --> 02:03.984
You know,
if I knew how to ride one,

02:03.986 --> 02:05.218
I'd steal it.

02:06.088 --> 02:07.621
Ignore him,

02:07.623 --> 02:10.156
he's just cranky because Bert
from the geology lab

02:10.157 --> 02:11.157
won a big grant.

02:11.159 --> 02:13.293
Oh, I heard him
interviewed on the radio!

02:13.295 --> 02:14.694
You know, when they
told him he won,

02:14.696 --> 02:16.730
he didn't believe it,
but then he did believe it.

02:16.732 --> 02:18.331
It was so funny.

02:19.701 --> 02:22.002
SHELDON: Who listens
to the radio anymore?

02:23.805 --> 02:25.739
Bert is studying the way
microbes in rocks

02:25.741 --> 02:28.041
can survive in extreme
environmental conditions.

02:28.043 --> 02:29.709
They say it could be
a potential indicator

02:29.711 --> 02:31.011
of life on other planets.

02:31.013 --> 02:32.212
You know what, I've met Bert.

02:32.214 --> 02:35.649
Isn't he an indicator
of life on other planets?

02:35.651 --> 02:37.117
(chuckles)

02:37.119 --> 02:39.286
SHELDON: You used to
make those jokes about me.

02:40.455 --> 02:42.722
Now everything is
Bert, Bert, Bert!

02:44.126 --> 02:45.325
You know, Sheldon,

02:45.327 --> 02:46.393
maybe if you take the time

02:46.395 --> 02:47.727
to actually
read Bert's research,

02:47.729 --> 02:49.296
you'd be less bitter
about him winning.

02:49.298 --> 02:51.031
(stammering):
You want me to read

02:51.033 --> 02:52.732
a geology paper?

02:52.734 --> 02:54.200
Honestly, I just
want you to be quiet

02:54.202 --> 02:55.535
but I'm all out of taffy.

02:58.974 --> 03:00.707
(knocking)
You busy?

03:00.709 --> 03:02.876
There's somebody out here
who wants to meet you.

03:02.878 --> 03:04.110
Who is it?

03:04.112 --> 03:06.613
Say hello to everybody's
little friend--

03:06.615 --> 03:08.948
remote control
Stephen Hawking!

03:13.722 --> 03:15.488
Where did you get that?

03:15.490 --> 03:17.324
I found him in an old box.

03:17.326 --> 03:19.759
Why would you buy it?

03:19.761 --> 03:21.594
I didn't buy it.

03:21.596 --> 03:23.463
I made it.

03:24.333 --> 03:25.432
Last question.

03:25.434 --> 03:27.701
What is wrong with you?

03:28.603 --> 03:30.570
What's the big deal?

03:30.572 --> 03:32.372
Howie, it's in poor taste.

03:32.374 --> 03:33.773
No, it's not.
Check it out.

03:33.775 --> 03:35.041
He says fun stuff.

03:35.043 --> 03:37.010
RC HAWKING:
Hey good lookin',

03:37.012 --> 03:39.012
want to go for a spin?

03:44.653 --> 03:48.088
His eyes also light up
in the dark.

03:53.995 --> 03:57.097
It's always fun watching him
read someone else's work.

03:57.966 --> 03:59.566
(scoffs)

04:03.872 --> 04:05.739
(moans)

04:11.313 --> 04:13.847
It's like scrolling
through the emojis

04:13.849 --> 04:16.182
on my phone.

04:17.017 --> 04:19.219
Ye-- why?

04:20.988 --> 04:22.989
Eh, why?!

04:24.893 --> 04:27.026
Oh, that's why.

04:27.028 --> 04:29.562
Sounds like the night
we had coitus.

04:32.167 --> 04:34.300
I hope you're happy
making me read this.

04:34.302 --> 04:35.902
Bert's work is remarkable.

04:35.904 --> 04:37.270
And I'm more upset
than ever.

04:37.272 --> 04:38.838
This is worse than
when I had to admit that

04:38.840 --> 04:41.841
Cedric the Entertainer's
actually entertaining.

04:41.843 --> 04:43.977
Sheldon, it's foolish

04:43.979 --> 04:46.413
to be angry that
Bert's work has merit.

04:46.415 --> 04:48.381
Yeah, well I-I am angry!

04:48.383 --> 04:49.883
And you telling me
not to be angry

04:49.885 --> 04:50.850
makes me angry!

04:50.852 --> 04:52.152
And do you know how
hearing myself

04:52.154 --> 04:54.187
say the word angry
over and over makes me feel?

04:54.189 --> 04:56.189
Ooh, a-angry?
What are you doing?

04:57.826 --> 05:00.493
I-I-I knew the answer.
I got excited.

05:01.863 --> 05:03.396
Hey, buddy, why don't
we go for a walk,

05:03.398 --> 05:04.531
so you can calm down.

05:04.533 --> 05:05.598
(sighs)

05:05.600 --> 05:06.766
That's a good idea.

05:06.768 --> 05:08.868
I guess everyone's
having them now.

05:09.704 --> 05:11.638
Hey, I'm trying
to help you.

05:11.640 --> 05:12.806
Fine.

05:12.808 --> 05:15.041
You can walk ahead of me
and scare off the pigeons.

05:18.413 --> 05:21.714
Just wave your arms a little
and they fly away, it's not...

05:24.319 --> 05:25.752
Okay, Raj,

05:25.754 --> 05:27.387
I'm gonna
show you something.

05:27.389 --> 05:28.421
Now,

05:28.423 --> 05:31.090
one of us thinks it's offensive.

05:31.092 --> 05:33.393
The other thinks it's hilarious

05:33.395 --> 05:35.628
and a great idea.

05:36.531 --> 05:38.465
But, I'm not
going to tell you

05:38.467 --> 05:39.899
who likes it.

05:47.542 --> 05:49.742
This is tough.

05:51.313 --> 05:52.846
But I'm going to say

05:52.848 --> 05:54.714
it's the guy who
shows me YouTube videos

05:54.716 --> 05:57.550
of people getting hit
in the nuts.

05:57.552 --> 05:59.285
(laughing)

05:59.287 --> 06:00.787
You're crazy.

06:00.789 --> 06:01.921
I've worked with Hawking.

06:01.923 --> 06:03.256
He's got a great sense of humor.

06:03.258 --> 06:04.224
And I think he'd like it.

06:04.226 --> 06:06.226
Okay, call him and show him.

06:06.228 --> 06:07.694
I dare you.

06:07.696 --> 06:09.929
I have no problem calling him.

06:09.931 --> 06:11.197
Fine, then do it.

06:11.199 --> 06:12.732
Fine, I will.

06:14.369 --> 06:18.037
While you're bothering the
world's most famous scientist,

06:18.039 --> 06:19.639
be sure to show him
how funny he looks

06:19.641 --> 06:21.841
getting stuck
under our dishwasher.

06:23.578 --> 06:25.078
What's this button do?

06:25.080 --> 06:28.481
Gentlemen,
start your wheelchairs.

06:31.620 --> 06:34.587
You laughed when that guy
got hit in the nuts.

06:37.259 --> 06:40.226
I laughed because
the guy was Leonard.

06:42.998 --> 06:45.765
I admire you, Leonard.

06:45.767 --> 06:48.067
Really, why?

06:48.069 --> 06:50.136
You're happy with who you are.

06:50.138 --> 06:52.672
You don't get jealous
of other people.

06:52.674 --> 06:55.608
Instead of being
weighed down by ambition,

06:55.610 --> 06:59.212
you just float along
like a dead body in a river.

07:02.083 --> 07:03.283
I couldn't just
take the compliment.

07:03.285 --> 07:04.617
I had to ask why.

07:07.822 --> 07:10.523
You know, I do understand
what you're feeling.

07:10.525 --> 07:12.458
My brother and sister's
accomplishments

07:12.460 --> 07:14.360
have always been
held over my head.

07:15.297 --> 07:16.729
How did you deal with it?

07:16.731 --> 07:19.332
I wet the bed until college,
but I don't think

07:19.334 --> 07:21.401
that's a quality fix.

07:22.237 --> 07:23.436
(groans)

07:23.438 --> 07:27.040
I can't believe I was
surpassed by a geologist.

07:27.042 --> 07:29.409
I mean...

07:29.411 --> 07:30.610
rocks!

07:30.612 --> 07:32.845
He studies rocks!

07:32.847 --> 07:35.848
If rock is so great,
how come paper beats it?

07:39.154 --> 07:40.553
Leonard, I'm having
a primal urge

07:40.555 --> 07:42.288
to throw this rock.

07:42.290 --> 07:43.323
Do it.

07:43.325 --> 07:45.191
Visualize it
as your anger

07:45.193 --> 07:47.393
a-and-and toss it
out of your life.

07:49.264 --> 07:51.464
Perhaps I will.

07:54.669 --> 07:56.436
This rock

07:56.438 --> 07:59.405
encapsulates
all my negative emotions.

08:00.208 --> 08:03.576
I will cast you far away.

08:03.578 --> 08:06.112
Feel free to take out a pigeon
while you're at it.

08:07.616 --> 08:09.749
Let it fly.

08:10.585 --> 08:11.651
(inhales deeply)

08:11.653 --> 08:13.853
Ow, ow, ow, ow,

08:13.855 --> 08:16.356
ow, ow, ow, ow...

08:17.525 --> 08:19.192
What happened?

08:19.194 --> 08:20.893
I tried to let go of anger

08:20.895 --> 08:23.429
and threw a rock
into my foot!

08:24.399 --> 08:26.532
Then he got more angry
and kicked the rock

08:26.534 --> 08:28.201
with his other foot.
Wha--?

08:28.203 --> 08:29.802
And what happened to you?

08:29.804 --> 08:31.104
Oh, I laughed so hard,

08:31.106 --> 08:32.871
I burst a blood vessel
in my nose. It's fine.

08:34.000 --> 08:40.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:43.159 --> 08:45.260
You know, it's one thing
to be envious,

08:45.262 --> 08:46.795
but now you're
injuring yourself.

08:46.797 --> 08:48.697
It has to stop.

08:48.699 --> 08:49.932
Although if you are
gonna do it again,

08:49.934 --> 08:53.001
please let me know,
so I can get it on video.

08:53.003 --> 08:54.536
You know, Sheldon,

08:54.538 --> 08:57.106
instead of fixating
on what Bert has,

08:57.108 --> 08:58.073
you should appreciate

08:58.075 --> 09:00.042
all of the good things
in your life.

09:00.044 --> 09:01.543
Y-You've got love,

09:01.545 --> 09:02.811
you're in good health,

09:02.813 --> 09:04.213
you've got a roof
over your head.

09:04.215 --> 09:05.381
Yeah,

09:05.383 --> 09:07.182
but you've got all those things,

09:07.184 --> 09:09.184
and no one's lining up
to be you.

09:11.589 --> 09:12.821
Anybody else want to try?

09:12.823 --> 09:13.889
I'm gonna go
make some more tea

09:13.891 --> 09:15.257
and question
my life choices.

09:17.027 --> 09:18.060
LEONARD:
You're up.

09:18.062 --> 09:19.495
(Penny clears throat)

09:19.497 --> 09:23.232
This is getting old fast,
Dolores, knock it off!

09:24.101 --> 09:25.601
Uh, do you really think

09:25.603 --> 09:26.702
calling me names is helpful?

09:26.704 --> 09:27.636
I do!

09:27.638 --> 09:29.872
Your life is fine,
you big baby!

09:29.874 --> 09:31.407
Maybe you're right.

09:31.409 --> 09:32.775
Really?!

09:34.011 --> 09:35.811
If it helps,
I'm questioning

09:35.813 --> 09:38.013
your life choices, too.

09:38.015 --> 09:39.314
Thank you, Penny.

09:39.316 --> 09:40.983
You know, I just need
to keep reminding myself

09:40.985 --> 09:43.619
that Bert's success
is not my failure.

09:43.621 --> 09:44.686
There you go.

09:44.688 --> 09:46.021
And that men
of his large stature

09:46.023 --> 09:47.689
are more susceptible
to a wide array

09:47.691 --> 09:50.392
of life-threatening diseases.

09:50.394 --> 09:52.461
There you go...

09:57.802 --> 09:59.334
What's up?

09:59.336 --> 10:01.069
I'm conducting
a quick survey.

10:01.071 --> 10:03.305
Do you think this
respectful

10:03.307 --> 10:06.642
and loving tribute
to a great man

10:06.644 --> 10:08.677
is in poor taste?

10:16.687 --> 10:18.620
Yep.

10:20.758 --> 10:23.292
Do you think this is
in poor taste?

10:23.294 --> 10:25.027
Does it spin around
and do tricks?

10:25.029 --> 10:25.928
Yeah!

10:25.930 --> 10:27.062
Then yeah.

10:28.098 --> 10:29.331
What do you think?

10:29.333 --> 10:32.701
That is hilarious!

10:34.038 --> 10:35.304
Give me the remote control.

10:35.306 --> 10:37.272
I want to drive him
into the girls' restroom.

10:38.642 --> 10:40.876
All right, we're done.
It's offensive.

10:51.388 --> 10:53.689
Top of the afternoon,
gentlemen.

10:53.691 --> 10:54.957
You're in a good mood.

10:54.959 --> 10:57.659
Well, it's a new day.
I have a new outlook.

10:57.661 --> 10:59.795
You know, I realized
I don't need to worry

10:59.797 --> 11:01.063
about other people.

11:01.065 --> 11:04.533
I just need to think
more about myself.

11:07.071 --> 11:11.006
Oh, how will we ever
get used to the new you?

11:11.942 --> 11:14.243
Well, I'm glad to
see you moving forward.

11:14.245 --> 11:15.911
Bert did quality
research.

11:15.913 --> 11:19.114
And he deserves whatever
accolades he receives.

11:19.116 --> 11:20.983
What is going on?

11:20.985 --> 11:23.385
Did you upgrade
his software last night?

11:24.421 --> 11:26.255
I think he might be
learning on his own.

11:26.257 --> 11:29.091
Then the robot uprising
has begun.

11:30.528 --> 11:32.461
Excuse me, I need to pay Bert

11:32.463 --> 11:35.297
a proper congratulations.

11:37.868 --> 11:39.935
He doesn't just look
like C-3PO,

11:39.937 --> 11:41.603
now he walks like him.

11:42.873 --> 11:44.039
Bert?

11:44.041 --> 11:47.175
I wanted to let you know
that I read your research,

11:47.177 --> 11:50.178
and your award is
well-deserved.

11:50.180 --> 11:53.282
Thanks. I've been
hearing that a lot.

11:53.284 --> 11:56.418
Ever since I won,
people think I'm great.

11:56.420 --> 11:58.921
Well, just this once,

11:58.923 --> 12:01.723
you can count me as people, too.

12:03.961 --> 12:06.595
You know, as a
MacArthur Grant winner,

12:06.597 --> 12:08.931
I'm allowed to nominate
someone for next year.

12:08.933 --> 12:11.667
Really?

12:11.669 --> 12:13.569
I didn't know that.

12:13.571 --> 12:14.770
So I was thinking,
you know,

12:14.772 --> 12:16.305
engineers don't get
a lot of respect.

12:16.307 --> 12:19.975
Is your friend Howard
working on anything cool?

12:22.546 --> 12:24.179
You know, I-I'm not sure.

12:24.181 --> 12:26.348
You know, you'd have to ask him.

12:26.350 --> 12:27.549
Excuse me.

12:35.426 --> 12:36.892
Aah!
(loud bang, thud)

12:39.063 --> 12:42.731
SHELDON: Leonard!
I hurt myself again.

12:44.401 --> 12:47.970
Excuse me, I-I have to
go take some pictures.

12:50.140 --> 12:52.841
I can't believe you
head-butted a water fountain.

12:54.278 --> 12:58.246
No, I went to punch
the water fountain,

12:58.248 --> 13:00.449
slipped in water in front
of the water fountain,

13:00.451 --> 13:03.552
and hit my head
on the water fountain.

13:03.554 --> 13:06.388
I can't imagine you
being violent.

13:06.390 --> 13:08.590
It's not hard.
Just picture the Three Stooges,

13:08.592 --> 13:10.859
and then take away two stooges.

13:11.996 --> 13:14.396
I'm so disappointed
in myself.

13:14.398 --> 13:16.965
Jealousy is
completely illogical.

13:16.967 --> 13:18.533
It's a human
emotion, Sheldon.

13:18.535 --> 13:19.901
Everyone gets jealous.

13:19.903 --> 13:21.603
I'm jealous of
Leonard and Penny

13:21.605 --> 13:22.638
and Howard and Bernadette

13:22.640 --> 13:24.406
for being in such
happy relationships.

13:24.408 --> 13:27.275
What about me and Sheldon?

13:29.246 --> 13:30.445
Sure.

13:33.951 --> 13:35.984
I've always been jealous
of how much money

13:35.986 --> 13:37.786
Raj's family has.

13:37.788 --> 13:39.521
Thank you for saying that.
Next to buying things,

13:39.523 --> 13:42.491
that is the best part
about having money.

13:42.493 --> 13:44.326
Ever since I met Penny,

13:44.328 --> 13:46.328
I've been envious
of her looks.

13:46.330 --> 13:48.530
Aw, thank you.

13:48.532 --> 13:50.365
That's why I was so happy
when you cut your hair off.

13:50.367 --> 13:51.433
What?!

13:51.435 --> 13:53.068
You know what I mean.

13:53.070 --> 13:54.636
You were still hot,
but more like a

13:54.638 --> 13:57.339
"why'd that hot girl
cut off all her hair?" hot.

13:58.542 --> 14:00.108
You liked my
short hair, right?

14:00.110 --> 14:02.911
Yeah... I loved it.

14:02.913 --> 14:06.248
Love you, love the hair, would
love to change the subject.

14:07.918 --> 14:10.752
Seriously, none of you liked it?

14:11.689 --> 14:13.255
I thought it was brave.

14:13.257 --> 14:15.857
Does that count as liking it?

14:17.227 --> 14:18.827
You know, how come
nobody's talking about

14:18.829 --> 14:20.996
Howard's dopey haircut?

14:24.001 --> 14:25.534
I think he looks cute.

14:25.536 --> 14:26.668
And I think
you're cute.

14:26.670 --> 14:27.803
I think you're both cute.

14:27.805 --> 14:30.238
I think I hate all of you nerds.

14:36.613 --> 14:38.246
Sorry I'm moving slowly.

14:38.248 --> 14:39.381
Oh, I don't mind.

14:39.383 --> 14:41.416
If you pull a butterscotch
out of your pocket,

14:41.418 --> 14:44.386
it would be like I'm
walking with my grandma.

14:46.623 --> 14:48.457
Oh, no.

14:52.563 --> 14:55.397
Did you...
A plaque?

14:55.399 --> 14:57.966
Nobody wants to see this.

14:57.968 --> 15:00.535
Well, change "plaque"
to "mixed-race couple"

15:00.537 --> 15:03.071
and you are my grandma.

15:03.073 --> 15:05.640
I can't take this anymore.

15:07.244 --> 15:10.312
Bert. Bert.
Bert!

15:10.314 --> 15:11.546
BERT:
Come in.

15:11.548 --> 15:14.082
All right, let's do this...

15:18.422 --> 15:19.955
Bert?

15:19.957 --> 15:21.323
We need to talk.

15:21.325 --> 15:22.524
What happened to you?

15:22.526 --> 15:25.160
Rock, rock, water fountain.

15:27.798 --> 15:29.197
I am not proud of this.

15:29.199 --> 15:32.267
But I have been envious
of your recent success.

15:32.269 --> 15:35.804
Wow, I won the MacArthur Grant,

15:35.806 --> 15:37.239
everyone's jealous of me.

15:37.241 --> 15:40.776
Once I get Lasik, I'll be
out of things to wish for.

15:41.879 --> 15:44.079
I was hoping by admitting
my weakness to you,

15:44.081 --> 15:45.981
I'd somehow be unburdened.

15:45.983 --> 15:47.249
Is it working?
No.

15:47.251 --> 15:48.316
Now that you know my weakness,

15:48.318 --> 15:49.618
I hate you more than ever.

15:51.555 --> 15:54.322
Well, you know, we're
both pretty smart.

15:54.324 --> 15:55.857
I bet if we put
our heads together,

15:55.859 --> 15:57.492
we could come up
with a solution.

15:57.494 --> 15:59.394
We... Hang on.

15:59.396 --> 16:01.730
You're my enemy.

16:01.732 --> 16:04.332
Now, the enemy of the enemy
is my friend.

16:04.334 --> 16:06.701
And right now,
I'm my own worst enemy.

16:06.703 --> 16:08.804
That makes you my fr--
Okay, I'm good to go.

16:10.307 --> 16:11.540
Great.

16:11.542 --> 16:12.941
Now that we're friends,
want to see if we can

16:12.943 --> 16:15.477
get tickets
to a taping of <i>Ellen?</i>

16:18.148 --> 16:19.781
You know what?
This isn't gonna work.

16:19.783 --> 16:23.385
Sheldon... wait.

16:23.387 --> 16:26.588
You know, you've got
a lot to be happy about.

16:26.590 --> 16:28.590
You're at the top
of your field,

16:28.592 --> 16:30.492
you have a great girlfriend.

16:30.494 --> 16:32.260
Yes! That's right!

16:32.262 --> 16:34.229
I have Amy!

16:37.367 --> 16:40.302
In the past, you've
professed feelings for her.

16:40.304 --> 16:41.770
Does it eat you up inside

16:41.772 --> 16:42.804
that I have her
and you don't?

16:42.806 --> 16:45.407
It used to.

16:45.409 --> 16:47.209
But now that I'm rich
and successful,

16:47.211 --> 16:49.311
I think I can do better.

16:51.515 --> 16:53.849
I can't believe
you punched Bert.

16:55.552 --> 16:57.252
I didn't punch him.

16:57.254 --> 16:58.987
He turned around,
and I gave him

16:58.989 --> 17:01.189
a Captain Kirk karate chop.

17:01.925 --> 17:02.891
I'm not even sure

17:02.893 --> 17:04.992
he knows I did it.

17:04.994 --> 17:06.694
Hey, Sheldon,

17:06.696 --> 17:09.030
I've got someone here who
might make you feel better.

17:09.031 --> 17:10.832
Hello, Sheldon.

17:10.834 --> 17:12.534
Professor Hawking!

17:12.536 --> 17:13.835
HAWKING:
I understand

17:13.837 --> 17:16.538
you're struggling
with professional jealousy.

17:16.540 --> 17:19.708
Thanks, Leonard, now he's
not gonna think I'm cool.

17:20.777 --> 17:23.878
Don't worry,
I know how you feel.

17:23.881 --> 17:26.348
I have never won a Nobel Prize.

17:26.349 --> 17:29.284
Oh, wow, that
doesn't seem fair.

17:29.286 --> 17:30.252
It's fine.

17:30.254 --> 17:32.220
I've been on <i>The Simpsons.</i>

17:34.191 --> 17:36.958
How do you deal with
the success of your colleagues?

17:36.960 --> 17:38.326
I remind myself

17:38.328 --> 17:41.529
every scientific advancement
is a victory.

17:41.531 --> 17:45.100
Also, I was on <i>Star Trek.</i>

17:46.536 --> 17:49.471
Oh, it was a good one. He played
poker with Sir Isaac...

17:49.473 --> 17:51.940
You don't care.

17:51.942 --> 17:53.942
Don't waste your time
on jealousy,

17:53.944 --> 17:56.511
Sheldon, you're too brilliant.

17:56.513 --> 17:58.613
How can you feel bad

17:58.615 --> 18:00.916
if Stephen Hawking says
you're brilliant?

18:00.918 --> 18:02.617
I can't.

18:02.619 --> 18:04.619
Thank you, Professor Hawking.

18:04.621 --> 18:06.221
You are a gift to mankind.

18:06.223 --> 18:09.157
There should be statues
of you everywhere.

18:09.159 --> 18:11.226
You know, the Lincoln Memorial
has a big chair.

18:11.228 --> 18:13.061
We could swap you right in.

18:15.332 --> 18:19.301
I always thought a motorized toy
of me would be cool.

18:22.606 --> 18:24.673
What a wonderful idea!

18:24.675 --> 18:27.142
How does this man
not have a Nobel?

18:27.144 --> 18:29.144
Do not tell Wolowitz.
Way ahead of you.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.984
A new study came out,
and it said that laughing

18:39.986 --> 18:42.420
makes your brain work better.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.221
And I know that's true
because laughing

18:44.223 --> 18:46.357
has made me the "smartiest."

18:46.359 --> 18:47.792
(laughter)

18:47.794 --> 18:49.093
Although, on the other hand,

18:49.095 --> 18:50.895
babies laugh a lot,
and they're dumb.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.363
(laughter)

18:52.365 --> 18:54.198
Do people know about her?

18:54.200 --> 18:55.700
'Cause she's delightful.
