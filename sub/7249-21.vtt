00:02.336 --> 00:03.921
Previously on Gilmore Girls:

00:04.003 --> 00:06.715
- What do you mean you had an accident?
- Jess swerved and...

00:06.798 --> 00:08.509
Jess was driving and you had an accident?

00:08.592 --> 00:09.593
But I'm fine.

00:09.676 --> 00:10.636
What accident?

00:10.719 --> 00:12.679
Jess was driving Rory's car
and he crashed it.

00:12.763 --> 00:15.140
- Have you talked to Dean?
- No, he gets home tomorrow.

00:15.182 --> 00:16.475
- What'll you say?
- I don't know.

00:16.558 --> 00:19.269
If you hadn't brought him here,
this wouldn't have happened.

00:19.353 --> 00:20.312
This is my fault?

00:20.395 --> 00:23.190
- What did you do to your arm?
- Here.

00:23.273 --> 00:24.650
- What is this?
- Just read it.

00:24.733 --> 00:27.903
Now I have to find Jess,
and I have to make sure that he's okay...

00:27.986 --> 00:31.281
and if that cuts into your screaming time,
that's just too damn bad.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.075
- Go to hell!
- Right back at you!

00:33.158 --> 00:35.160
Not long after the accident happened...

00:35.244 --> 00:37.329
Luke walked him
straight to the bus station...

00:37.412 --> 00:39.790
stuck the kid on the bus,
sent him home to his mom.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.167
- Is he really gone?
- Yes.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.086
Okay.

00:46.588 --> 00:47.714
Do you wanna come in?

00:47.798 --> 00:50.509
All I know is that Jess is gone.

00:51.593 --> 00:55.848
Well, what will we do
for entertainment around here?

00:56.223 --> 00:58.183
Beats the hell out of me.

01:03.856 --> 01:05.691
- Where is this place?
- Not too far.

01:05.774 --> 01:07.526
You've been saying that for miles.

01:07.609 --> 01:10.070
- My feet are sore.
- When did you become older than me?

01:10.153 --> 01:12.865
Tell me what this new breakfast place is,
and I'll be quiet.

01:12.948 --> 01:16.118
It an amazing new mystery place I found.
That's all I'm telling you.

01:16.201 --> 01:17.494
Is it in this town or the next?

01:17.578 --> 01:19.830
- We don't patronize the next town.
- Since when?

01:19.913 --> 01:22.332
Didn't they feed lead
to our jumping frog or something?

01:22.416 --> 01:25.043
Right after they stoned the woman
who won the lottery.

01:25.127 --> 01:26.420
See, so the boycott's legit.

01:26.503 --> 01:28.672
- Wait. Stop.
- Look, it's Michael Landon.

01:28.755 --> 01:31.550
You guys walk fast.
I've been chasing you the past two blocks.

01:31.633 --> 01:32.759
We were being followed.

01:32.843 --> 01:34.303
I told you I wasn't being paranoid.

01:34.386 --> 01:37.347
Now you'll believe me
when I say the furniture moved itself.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.183
- Where're you going?
- Mystery breakfast.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.935
- Out of town?
- Remember the definition of mystery?

01:42.019 --> 01:45.230
I was wondering if it's okay
to practice on your pots and pans again.

01:45.314 --> 01:46.899
It's not like they have any other use.

01:46.982 --> 01:48.192
I've almost nailed Ramble On.

01:48.275 --> 01:51.236
I have to stop hitting my face
with the sticks when I pull back.

01:51.278 --> 01:52.738
John Bonham had that same problem.

01:52.779 --> 01:55.240
- Key is in the turtle.
- Enjoy your mystery breakfast.

01:55.324 --> 01:56.700
Come on. It's not much farther.

01:56.783 --> 02:00.078
We're not heading toward
any businesses of any kind.

02:00.495 --> 02:01.580
What?

02:01.663 --> 02:03.874
- We have arrived.
- Arrived where?

02:03.957 --> 02:05.834
You are without shame.

02:07.169 --> 02:08.920
Sookie, you do not have to do this.

02:09.003 --> 02:12.925
What do you mean? Feeding my girls,
making them happy. I love doing this.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.843
Yeah, so feel the love and pass the salt.

02:14.927 --> 02:17.679
- It makes me feel guilty.
- Eating can help drown that.

02:17.763 --> 02:19.765
Yeah, eat. I'm gonna eat.

02:20.682 --> 02:22.518
Can the help sit at the table, too?

02:22.601 --> 02:25.395
As long as they don't sing folk songs
or tell bawdy stories.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.232
What's with Narcoleptic Nate over there?

02:28.815 --> 02:31.276
He's not much of a morning person.

02:31.944 --> 02:34.738
Now say,
'I can't believe I ate the whole thing. '

02:34.821 --> 02:37.741
It takes him about an hour
to become Jackson.

02:37.824 --> 02:40.285
- Hey, I had a good idea for the wedding.
- Cool.

02:40.327 --> 02:43.497
Instead of wrapped Jordan almonds things
at every place setting...

02:43.580 --> 02:46.041
- what if we wrap up a few Aspirin?
- Aspirin?

02:46.124 --> 02:48.252
For the morning-after hangovers.

02:48.335 --> 02:51.296
- That's funny.
- 'Cause Jordan almonds are so done.

02:51.338 --> 02:54.508
Jackson, what do you think?
Aspirin over almonds?

02:55.759 --> 02:57.553
- Can we take that as a yes?
- No.

02:57.636 --> 03:01.265
Everything eventually registers.
He'll chime in on this in a couple of days.

03:01.348 --> 03:02.349
- Days?
- Days.

03:02.432 --> 03:05.853
Hey, is Jackson in the house?
Let me hear you say...

03:05.936 --> 03:07.938
- A new toy.
- Shameless.

03:09.000 --> 03:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:04.203 --> 04:06.580
- How's it going?
- I hate these books. Hate them.

04:06.663 --> 04:07.706
No.

04:07.789 --> 04:10.584
See that? They're trying to escape.
They hate me, too.

04:10.667 --> 04:11.960
Your books don't hate you.

04:12.044 --> 04:14.838
Rory, my brain is full.
It has reached capacity.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.714
It's Shea Stadium
when the Beatles played.

04:16.757 --> 04:20.010
It's cramped, girls are screaming,
and George is fighting with Ringo.

04:20.093 --> 04:23.222
- You have a very active head.
- I cannot ingest any more information.

04:23.305 --> 04:24.723
- Take a break.
- I don't have time.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.225
Close your eyes, clear your head.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.018
Clearing my head just means that...

04:28.101 --> 04:31.522
all the knowledge I have painstakingly
stuffed in there will leak out.

04:31.605 --> 04:35.234
In order to make room for stuff,
I lose stuff. It's a very vicious circle.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.693
I'll make some coffee.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.779
- I hate finals.
- Nobody likes finals.

04:38.862 --> 04:41.823
Thank God I'm graduating
and it's the last time I cram like this.

04:41.907 --> 04:43.742
My pursuit of higher education
has led me...

04:43.825 --> 04:46.578
to an interesting discovery about myself.
You wanna hear it?

04:46.620 --> 04:49.248
- Sure.
- I despise academics.

04:49.331 --> 04:53.043
Learning, knowledge, it's all worthless.
I have no idea what you see in it.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.086
Learning is fun.

04:54.169 --> 04:57.214
Plus, for me, there's that
I'm a minor, so it's mandatory thing.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.133
That's what kills me. This is self-inflicted.
I'm a masochist.

05:00.217 --> 05:04.012
I might as well be carrying a switch and
periodically lacerating myself with it.

05:04.096 --> 05:07.391
That diploma hanging on the wall
is going to make this all worthwhile.

05:07.474 --> 05:11.562
I guess. Unless I turn into John Nash
and start drooling on people.

05:12.354 --> 05:15.023
- You're graduating.
- I know.

05:15.107 --> 05:18.402
No, you're graduating.
There's gonna be a ceremony.

05:19.278 --> 05:21.113
I don't know. It's a community college.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.656
Community colleges have ceremonies.

05:22.739 --> 05:26.368
My college doesn't even have a lawn.
They won't necessarily have a ceremony.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.620
- They must. Did you ask?
- No.

05:29.037 --> 05:33.625
Well, now that you mention it,
I think someone said something about...

05:33.709 --> 05:36.503
some cheesy ceremony
for my business class.

05:36.587 --> 05:39.464
- When is it?
- I don't know. Next Thursday.

05:39.548 --> 05:41.925
- That's great. You have to do it.
- I don't know.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.468
- You have to do it.
- Really?

05:43.510 --> 05:46.430
Yes. You've never been a part
of an actual graduation ceremony.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.807
I know. That's because
my conservative high school...

05:48.891 --> 05:51.935
wouldn't let me be in the ceremony
and nurse you at the same time.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.937
- Don't be gross.
- You think I should do it?

05:54.021 --> 05:56.940
- You've worked hard. You've earned it.
- I guess.

05:57.024 --> 06:00.652
Come on. You know that deep down
you really want to do this.

06:00.736 --> 06:03.280
I'll admit I've always wanted
to wear one of those gowns.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.406
And the hat?

06:04.489 --> 06:06.658
For the tassel.
You know my thing for fringe.

06:06.742 --> 06:10.787
They call out your name,
and people clap, and you get your diploma.

06:10.829 --> 06:14.416
Then you do that thing where you move
the tassel from one side to the other.

06:14.500 --> 06:15.709
Very symbolic, very dramatic.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.920
- That's it. You're doing it.
- If you insist.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.214
- Who do you want to invite?
- I don't know. You.

06:20.297 --> 06:22.007
- And?
- That's cool with me.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.176
- Sookie and Jackson?
- That would be fun.

06:24.218 --> 06:26.887
- And Grandma and Grandpa?
- Oh, no.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.556
Come on. It's your graduation.
They should be there.

06:29.640 --> 06:32.643
- Forget it. They won't want to be there.
- Of course they will.

06:32.726 --> 06:35.854
Rory, I was supposed to graduate
from high school, go to Vassar...

06:35.938 --> 06:40.317
marry a Yale man, get myself
a proper nickname like Babe or Bunny.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.362
Instead, I got pregnant.
I didn't finish high school...

06:43.403 --> 06:46.198
I didn't marry your father,
and I ended up in a career...

06:46.240 --> 06:49.034
that apparently Jessica Hahn
would think was beneath her.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.285
I humiliated them.

06:50.369 --> 06:53.872
The two proudest people in the world,
and I humiliated them.

06:53.956 --> 06:57.084
I spoiled their plans.
I took their fine upbringing...

06:57.167 --> 07:00.671
in a world of comfort and opportunity,
and I threw it in their faces.

07:00.754 --> 07:04.007
I broke their hearts,
and they'll never forgive me.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.343
I guess I can't expect them to.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.555
Maybe you're wrong about how they feel.
It was a long time ago.

07:09.638 --> 07:14.393
Rory, I don't want them to go.
It'll just hurt them, and me.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.562
- Okay?
- Okay.

07:18.272 --> 07:21.233
- You should get back to your studying.
- Fine.

07:22.025 --> 07:23.277
- Great.
- What?

07:23.360 --> 07:26.488
I've already forgotten everything
I read in the last two hours.

07:26.572 --> 07:28.031
- No, you haven't.
- Yes, I have.

07:28.115 --> 07:31.159
In fact, I may have forgotten
everything I've ever known.

07:31.243 --> 07:33.662
- Child, what be your name?
- Study.

07:36.999 --> 07:38.876
Just explain the concept one more time.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.586
And be mocked again? No, thank you.

07:40.669 --> 07:42.546
- Come on.
- Maybe we're missing something.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.590
You go to a special shooting range.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.216
- A skeet shooting range.
- Right.

07:46.300 --> 07:49.178
There's two of you,
and the guy with the gun yells, 'Pull. '

07:49.261 --> 07:52.472
The other guy releases a clay pigeon
from a machine into the air...

07:52.556 --> 07:53.891
and you try to shoot it.

07:53.932 --> 07:56.435
- No, I don't think we're missing anything.
- I knew it.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.061
- You shoot pigeons?
- Clay pigeons.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.606
- When you hit them, does blood come out?
- They're clay.

08:00.689 --> 08:02.149
And why do you like to do this?

08:02.232 --> 08:06.028
My dad shot skeet when he was my age,
and he wants to pass the tradition down.

08:06.111 --> 08:08.071
What if you accidentally hit a real pigeon?

08:08.155 --> 08:10.032
- Does that count?
- That's never happened.

08:10.115 --> 08:12.910
What if a clay pigeon hits a real pigeon?
Does that count?

08:12.951 --> 08:14.286
I've only done this once.

08:14.369 --> 08:15.662
If you get really good...

08:15.746 --> 08:18.916
do you move on to other animals,
like clay chickens and clay sheep?

08:18.957 --> 08:20.959
We didn't go skeet shooting.
I made it all up.

08:21.043 --> 08:22.753
I got to go in here.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.130
- What do you need?
- Just general stuff.

08:25.172 --> 08:28.467
- You guys go and be in love.
- See you back at the house.

08:28.509 --> 08:31.428
What if you shoot the person
who throws the pigeon in the air?

08:31.512 --> 08:32.471
Would that count?

08:38.977 --> 08:39.977
Sorry.

08:40.062 --> 08:42.813
No, I should have signaled or honked.
My fault.

08:45.150 --> 08:47.569
I guess it was inevitable,
us running into each other.

08:47.653 --> 08:50.030
- It's a very tiny community.
- I guess so.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.575
- How's the diner?
- It's still there.

08:53.867 --> 08:57.788
Yes. I knew that.
I'm able to empirically, with my eyes...

09:00.457 --> 09:03.627
- Hey, Luke, do you think we could...
- I got to get back.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.462
Okay. Right.

09:08.257 --> 09:09.675
I'll get it.

09:11.844 --> 09:13.512
- Hi, Grandma.
- Hello, Rory.

09:13.595 --> 09:15.389
Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

09:15.472 --> 09:18.058
I'm thrilled to see you on no notice.

09:18.141 --> 09:21.854
So tell me, what's this about?
You were so mysterious on the phone.

09:21.937 --> 09:24.189
I wanted to talk to you
about something in person.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.732
Well, come in.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.613
It's an English tea service.

09:31.697 --> 09:34.199
One of the advantages
of our having an English maid.

09:34.283 --> 09:36.201
That, and the fact that she speaks English.

09:36.243 --> 09:39.413
- You didn't have to do this.
- But it's teatime, and I wanted to...

09:39.496 --> 09:42.958
Oh, no. Beatrice,
I told you to doily-line the plates.

09:43.041 --> 09:44.960
You don't have to doily-line the plates.

09:45.043 --> 09:46.920
- Hello.
- We're in the dining room.

09:47.546 --> 09:50.174
- Rory, you're already here.
- You're out of breath.

09:50.215 --> 09:53.051
- I ran over from the office.
- You didn't have to run.

09:53.135 --> 09:56.013
Your grandmother said
you had something to discuss with us.

09:56.054 --> 09:57.848
That certainly justifies a run.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.350
All right, everybody, sit.

10:02.561 --> 10:04.479
Pour the tea, Beatrice.

10:05.314 --> 10:07.524
Actually, Beatrice, could you hold off on...

10:07.608 --> 10:10.235
pouring the tea for just a minute?
Thank you very much.

10:10.319 --> 10:13.864
Grandma, Grandpa,
I would like to propose an idea to you.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.950
You can go for it or not.
It's entirely up to you.

10:17.034 --> 10:20.245
But I would like for you to promise me
that you will not get upset.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.330
We won't get upset.

10:21.413 --> 10:24.082
- And you will try to keep an open mind.
- All right.

10:24.124 --> 10:27.669
And you will let me finish my presentation
completely before you respond.

10:27.753 --> 10:29.713
She's been hanging around you
far too much.

10:29.796 --> 10:33.217
Rory, we accept your terms.
Please proceed.

10:33.258 --> 10:34.593
Thank you.

10:34.635 --> 10:37.888
First, let me start by saying
that Mom doesn't know I'm here.

10:37.971 --> 10:42.476
She'd probably be mad if she knew
that I was, but I feel this is important.

10:42.559 --> 10:45.020
As you know,
Mom's been going to business school...

10:45.103 --> 10:47.189
at the community college
for three years now.

10:47.272 --> 10:48.524
I believe she's mentioned it.

10:48.607 --> 10:51.652
She's doing very well
and she's finishing up.

10:51.735 --> 10:55.906
Actually, she's graduating Thursday,
and there's going to be a ceremony.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.784
I think it would mean a lot to her
if you guys were there.

10:58.867 --> 11:00.994
It may not seem like it would, but it's true.

11:01.078 --> 11:04.248
If it would mean so much to her,
why didn't she invite us herself?

11:04.289 --> 11:06.124
'Cause she didn't think you'd want to go.

11:06.208 --> 11:08.794
And I get that, but I think it's a mistake.

11:08.877 --> 11:10.295
I had a school thing once.

11:10.379 --> 11:13.298
I wasn't sure if Mom would want to go,
so I didn't invite her.

11:13.382 --> 11:15.884
It was my kindergarten
Salute To Vegetables pageant...

11:15.968 --> 11:18.762
and I was Broccoli
and I did a tap dance with Beets.

11:18.846 --> 11:22.474
And the entire number,
I was just thinking, 'Mom's not here. '

11:22.516 --> 11:24.977
And it was my fault that she wasn't there.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.688
Well, it was kind of a life lesson for me.

11:27.771 --> 11:30.065
Now, if the thought
of going to Mom's graduation...

11:30.148 --> 11:33.277
upsets you, or makes you unhappy,
or uncomfortable in any way...

11:33.318 --> 11:35.070
then please don't go.

11:35.153 --> 11:37.698
Because this is
an important night for Mom...

11:37.781 --> 11:41.493
and if you go, you should go
under the right circumstances.

11:44.746 --> 11:47.499
Those are the tickets.
It's Thursday, 7:00 p. m.

11:47.583 --> 11:51.295
It's indoors, so weather's not an issue.
You can use them or not.

11:51.336 --> 11:53.714
No hard feelings. Do what you feel is best.

11:53.797 --> 11:57.676
And, if you don't mind,
I would really appreciate it...

11:57.759 --> 12:00.679
if you would keep this conversation
between the three of us.

12:00.762 --> 12:04.099
That's all I have to say.
Thanks very much for your patience.

12:04.183 --> 12:07.644
I believe I have time for a scone
before my bus leaves.

12:08.854 --> 12:10.898
Beatrice, the tea, please.

12:11.190 --> 12:13.358
Emily, these look delicious.

12:13.650 --> 12:16.028
So, Richard, how was your day today?

12:17.112 --> 12:20.741
I am feeling so good, sister,
because it's over.

12:22.242 --> 12:25.704
No more finals, no more studying,
no more school. The pressure's off.

12:25.746 --> 12:28.290
Do you know how much pressure I felt?
Do you?

12:28.373 --> 12:32.211
All last week, I felt like a giant man
and his brother were sitting on my chest.

12:32.294 --> 12:33.962
- A giant man?
- And his giant brother.

12:34.046 --> 12:37.090
- Did they have names?
- Clem and Clem. Same names.

12:37.174 --> 12:39.760
Which did not reflect well
on their mothers' imagination.

12:39.843 --> 12:41.553
- Mother.
- Mothers. There were two Clems.

12:41.595 --> 12:44.056
- 'Cause they were brothers.
- Yes, so they had mothers.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.891
You're drawing me
into your drunken world.

12:45.974 --> 12:48.310
It's not a bad place to be, my friend.

12:48.393 --> 12:49.853
Tank's empty.

12:51.021 --> 12:53.106
- What is this?
- What?

12:53.273 --> 12:55.317
This life plan book thing.

12:55.400 --> 12:59.738
A gift for the grads from the happy people
at Hartford Community College.

12:59.780 --> 13:02.324
Hey, how many margaritas
is too many margaritas?

13:02.407 --> 13:04.743
If you can't remember
where the living room is.

13:04.826 --> 13:05.953
I'm still good.

13:06.036 --> 13:08.956
Okay, here's an interesting question
for you.

13:09.039 --> 13:13.794
'Have you given any thought to how
children will work into your future plans?'

13:14.461 --> 13:16.880
They're not gonna stand in my way,
that's for sure.

13:16.964 --> 13:20.133
I plan to have some, of course,
but I'm just gonna knock them out...

13:20.217 --> 13:22.636
and have nanny catch them
and care for them...

13:22.719 --> 13:24.847
make sure Mick Jagger
doesn't come near them...

13:24.930 --> 13:26.765
and then return them to me
when they're 21.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.141
What about me?

13:28.225 --> 13:31.895
You are my favorite eldest child.
You get to stay by my side.

13:31.979 --> 13:33.772
I feel so privileged.

13:34.106 --> 13:35.440
I'll get it.

13:35.649 --> 13:39.945
Now, if that's Mick Jagger, hang up,
and blow that whistle I gave you.

13:41.947 --> 13:43.657
- Hello.
- Hi.

13:45.033 --> 13:47.119
- Hello?
- Hi.

13:47.202 --> 13:48.453
Is this a bad time?

13:48.537 --> 13:50.789
No. Just hold on a sec.

13:52.583 --> 13:55.002
The music. I'll be right back.

14:01.008 --> 14:02.801
- Hey.
- You said that already.

14:02.843 --> 14:05.095
I did. You're right. Sorry.

14:05.179 --> 14:07.139
- So, what's up?
- Nothing.

14:08.098 --> 14:09.975
- What about you?
- Same.

14:10.309 --> 14:13.312
So, what have you been doing?

14:13.353 --> 14:16.648
Nothing much, just hanging out,
in the park mostly.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.318
- Central Park?
- Washington Square Park.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.154
It's cooler.
It's where David Lee Roth got busted.

14:22.196 --> 14:24.573
Right. I hope he's got it together now.

14:24.656 --> 14:26.617
Sounds like
you got a party going on there.

14:26.700 --> 14:29.286
- No, it's just me and my mom.
- Right.

14:30.662 --> 14:33.790
Okay, well, I'm gonna go.
This is long distance.

14:33.832 --> 14:36.251
Yeah, it is long distance.

14:37.211 --> 14:39.338
So, see you.

14:39.671 --> 14:41.715
Yeah. See you.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.521
Mom? What's wrong?

14:55.604 --> 14:56.939
I'm experiencing frustration.

14:57.022 --> 15:00.651
At the general state of things in the world
or something in particular?

15:00.692 --> 15:02.361
What do you wear to a graduation?

15:02.444 --> 15:04.321
- A cap and gown.
- I mean underneath.

15:04.363 --> 15:06.198
Whatever you want.
The gown will cover it.

15:06.281 --> 15:08.242
It's complicated.
I don't want to overdress...

15:08.325 --> 15:10.285
so I'm sweating if it's hot
in the auditorium.

15:10.369 --> 15:12.913
But if I don't have enough on
and it's cold, I'll freeze.

15:12.996 --> 15:15.249
It is complicated,
especially if you over think it.

15:15.332 --> 15:16.333
I need a helpful comment.

15:16.416 --> 15:19.461
Take light layers. Wear your
turquoise-and-tan dress you just got.

15:19.545 --> 15:21.880
It's cool and it will look good
without your gown on.

15:21.964 --> 15:25.384
Wear your turquoise sweater over it.
It will look great with the dress...

15:25.425 --> 15:27.886
and it'll keep you warm
if it's cold in the auditorium.

15:27.928 --> 15:30.305
- You are a fashion genius.
- You taught me everything.

15:30.389 --> 15:32.891
- My brain's not working.
- You're excited. It's a big day.

15:32.975 --> 15:34.184
What time will you get there?

15:34.268 --> 15:36.937
I have newspaper stuff after school.
But no later than 6:00.

15:37.020 --> 15:39.231
- We'll go out to eat after?
- Anyplace. It's on me.

15:39.273 --> 15:40.315
You don't have to do that.

15:40.399 --> 15:42.150
You're a graduate.
You get to be pampered.

15:42.234 --> 15:45.612
Then I'd like to go to Chateau
Jean Georges La Jean Georges in Paris.

15:45.696 --> 15:48.282
I'll look it up in Daggit
and book the Concorde. I got to go.

15:48.365 --> 15:49.491
I got to get ready.

15:49.575 --> 15:53.996
Wait, I wanna see my little graduate
one more time before the big event.

15:54.246 --> 15:56.623
Do I look like I'm ready
to make my way in the world?

15:56.707 --> 15:58.292
If all else fails, you can marry rich.

15:58.375 --> 16:00.043
I love that we always have that option.

16:00.127 --> 16:01.420
What'll you do with your hair?

16:01.503 --> 16:02.921
I got the curling iron warming up.

16:02.963 --> 16:05.799
Mom, the cap. You put it on,
it's gonna smoosh the curls down.

16:05.883 --> 16:08.051
- You are a genius.
- See you tonight.

16:08.135 --> 16:11.930
Try to seat us next to a celebrity
on the Concorde, like Sting or someone.

16:12.014 --> 16:13.265
I'll try.

16:13.473 --> 16:16.268
- I told her, 'Look, missy... '
- You called your advisor 'missy?'

16:16.351 --> 16:17.394
It was attitudinal.

16:17.436 --> 16:20.814
I said, 'I'm not taking AP Calculus
from Henemen. I'm going with Branch.

16:20.898 --> 16:23.692
'Branch is a graduate of MIT,
and Henemen went to Berkeley.

16:23.775 --> 16:27.070
'He may have majored in Math,
but what did he minor in, bean sprouts?'

16:27.154 --> 16:30.574
I'm telling my advisor all this
and I look in her trash can...

16:30.657 --> 16:33.452
and there's this half-eaten banana in there.
Nothing else.

16:33.535 --> 16:37.414
I pictured her sitting in this shoebox
of an office, eating a banana by herself...

16:37.456 --> 16:38.916
and I almost felt sorry for her.

16:38.957 --> 16:42.169
Then she questioned my judgment
about Berkeley, so I eviscerated her.

16:42.252 --> 16:45.339
She was welling up at the end,
but she held it in until I was gone.

16:45.422 --> 16:48.592
I have enough faculty recommendations
to run for Student Council...

16:48.634 --> 16:51.470
so I don't need her anyway.
My locker's this way.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.145
- Are they closed?
- They're closed.

17:00.229 --> 17:01.688
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

17:01.772 --> 17:05.442
Okay, one second, and open.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.612
You made me a tassel-hat cake.

17:08.654 --> 17:12.115
Filled with two pounds of crushed
chocolate-covered espresso beans.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.825
- You're evil.
- And you're graduating.

17:13.909 --> 17:15.993
- Yes, I am, aren't I?
- Here.

17:16.161 --> 17:19.498
I brought the pictures you wanted
to see of my high school graduation.

17:19.540 --> 17:20.582
Hand them over, lady.

17:20.665 --> 17:23.042
- Okay, but don't laugh.
- I promise.

17:23.126 --> 17:25.628
I was younger then, not as refined.

17:25.671 --> 17:27.673
- You're stoned.
- Totally.

17:27.756 --> 17:30.133
- I thought you hated that.
- It was peer pressure.

17:30.175 --> 17:33.387
If Gilbert Garcia offered you a toke,
you took it or took off.

17:33.470 --> 17:35.180
Gilbert had a snappy slogan.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.015
I was nauseous all day.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.183
Your parents?

17:38.267 --> 17:41.019
For the traditional,
parents flanking their graduate child.

17:41.061 --> 17:43.313
- Don't they look proud?
- They do. Very proud.

17:43.397 --> 17:44.481
What is that?

17:44.565 --> 17:46.900
It's pictures
of Sookie's high school graduation.

17:46.984 --> 17:48.861
What was
your high school graduation like?

17:48.902 --> 17:51.488
It was dignified,
as most French ceremonies are.

17:51.530 --> 17:55.534
Poetry was read, a string quartet played,
a ballerina performed.

17:55.617 --> 17:59.580
Drank Boone's Farm out of a bota bag
and knocked a beach ball around?

17:59.663 --> 18:01.790
I don't understand half of what you say.

18:01.874 --> 18:03.625
That's why we work.

18:06.170 --> 18:08.172
- Hello.
- Hey, Lor, how you doing?

18:08.213 --> 18:10.716
Christopher. I'm good. I'm excited.

18:10.799 --> 18:13.260
You should be. It's a big day.
Did you get my present?

18:13.343 --> 18:16.013
- What present?
- A basket. You should've gotten it by now.

18:16.054 --> 18:19.224
- Did a basket come for me?
- It came. It was heavy.

18:19.308 --> 18:22.352
I felt a twinge,
so I dropped it for health reasons.

18:22.436 --> 18:24.396
It's probably still intact.

18:24.479 --> 18:27.024
My cracked staff
has just informed me of its arrival.

18:27.107 --> 18:28.942
I'm going to find it.

18:33.030 --> 18:34.907
I put it together myself.

18:34.990 --> 18:37.409
- And it's all for me?
- All for you.

18:40.412 --> 18:42.247
A $25 savings bond.

18:42.331 --> 18:43.624
That's a long-term investment.

18:43.707 --> 18:46.210
Don't touch it for 30 years,
you're looking at $45.

18:46.251 --> 18:48.253
- A youth hostel card.
- For the young girl...

18:48.337 --> 18:50.589
who doesn't mind
sharing a bathroom with strangers.

18:50.672 --> 18:53.800
'What Color Is Your Parachute?
A practical manual for job hunters. '

18:53.884 --> 18:56.929
Helping you answer: What you wanna do
and where you wanna do it.

18:57.012 --> 19:00.057
A DVD of The Graduate. Got to have that.
The Portable Nietzsche.

19:00.098 --> 19:01.183
Light, cheery reading.

19:01.266 --> 19:04.019
An application to join the armed forces.

19:04.102 --> 19:07.105
If your dreams don't pan out,
it's a viable option.

19:07.189 --> 19:10.067
And something in a nice little velvet box.

19:11.777 --> 19:14.821
A necklace. The pearl almost looks real.

19:14.905 --> 19:17.366
It better look very real, because it is.

19:17.783 --> 19:19.993
- That's not funny.
- This is not a funny gift.

19:20.077 --> 19:24.248
Christopher, this is extremely not funny.
This is totally humorless.

19:24.289 --> 19:26.041
It's beautiful.

19:26.124 --> 19:27.543
I think you're awesome, Lor.

19:27.626 --> 19:30.462
With everything you do,
and raising Rory the way you did...

19:30.504 --> 19:32.172
you're superwoman.

19:32.256 --> 19:33.423
Have a great day.

19:33.507 --> 19:35.801
Wish I could be there.
Take lots of pictures for me.

19:35.843 --> 19:37.761
The camera. I forgot the camera.

19:37.803 --> 19:39.596
Look in the basket.

19:41.265 --> 19:42.724
You thought of everything.

19:42.808 --> 19:44.476
- Have a great night.
- Thanks.

19:44.643 --> 19:46.770
You, too. Bye.

20:09.168 --> 20:10.627
Could you...

20:12.004 --> 20:14.339
Excuse me. Sir, do you know...

20:14.923 --> 20:17.759
Excuse me.
Do you know where Washington...

20:17.843 --> 20:19.970
Excuse me, ma'am.
Washington Square Park?

20:20.012 --> 20:22.055
- End of Fifth.
- Thank you.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.643
Excuse me. Where's Fifth?

20:34.818 --> 20:35.819
Hi.

20:38.572 --> 20:40.073
How you doing?

20:40.157 --> 20:43.160
- Good. How about you?
- Good.

20:45.454 --> 20:47.289
- You hungry?
- Starved.

20:47.789 --> 20:49.333
I know a place.

20:57.174 --> 20:59.176
I feel very urban today.

20:59.218 --> 21:01.595
Yeah, the plaid just screams urban.

21:01.678 --> 21:04.640
- I think I look like a native.
- How well do you know Manhattan?

21:04.723 --> 21:07.100
I've been here a few times.
We saw the Bangles here.

21:07.184 --> 21:08.477
When was that, 20 years ago?

21:08.560 --> 21:11.188
- It was a reunion, and they were great.
- They're okay.

21:11.230 --> 21:13.273
A couple of years ago,
Mom drove us in to shop.

21:13.357 --> 21:17.236
She couldn't find a good parking place,
and all of the lots were total rip-offs.

21:17.277 --> 21:19.571
So she kept making u-turns
and cutting off taxis...

21:19.655 --> 21:22.449
and we were being screamed at
in so many different languages...

21:22.533 --> 21:24.409
that we just turned around
and drove home...

21:24.493 --> 21:26.912
and bought a Hummel
at the curio shop in Stars Hollow.

21:26.995 --> 21:28.163
Very adventurous.

21:28.247 --> 21:30.666
I'm just saying I'm no stranger
to the Big Apple.

21:30.749 --> 21:32.876
You are if you're calling it the Big Apple.

21:32.960 --> 21:35.754
So I don't have the lingo down yet,
but I have the attitude.

21:35.796 --> 21:37.089
- You do?
- Yeah.

21:37.130 --> 21:39.383
When I was getting a locker
for my backpack...

21:39.424 --> 21:42.761
at the bus stop there was this guy
just standing there staring at me.

21:42.803 --> 21:46.598
And instead of ignoring him,
I fixed him with a really withering stare.

21:46.682 --> 21:48.517
- That I've got to see.
- No.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.811
Come on. Let me see your withering stare.

21:50.894 --> 21:52.646
It's dangerous. I could hurt you.

21:52.729 --> 21:54.857
- I've been hurt before.
- No.

21:55.774 --> 21:57.401
I'm disappointed.

21:59.194 --> 22:02.698
- So, your arm's okay?
- Yeah. It looks worse than it is.

22:03.615 --> 22:06.076
I like this Emily chick. A friend of yours?

22:06.118 --> 22:08.954
She's a friend to all of us dispossessed.

22:08.996 --> 22:11.957
- So here's our lunch place.
- A hot-dog stand?

22:12.040 --> 22:14.418
I eat here everyday.
It's nothing fancy, but...

22:14.459 --> 22:16.837
- No, I love it. It's perfect.
- Good.

22:16.920 --> 22:20.174
- One with everything on it.
- Make that two, please.

22:20.257 --> 22:22.718
So, how's...

22:23.635 --> 22:25.429
- Luke?
- Yeah.

22:25.804 --> 22:26.930
Okay.

22:27.514 --> 22:29.391
- He went fishing.
- Fishing?

22:29.474 --> 22:31.435
Yeah. He didn't catch anything though.

22:31.476 --> 22:33.520
- He probably used the wrong bait.
- Yeah.

22:33.604 --> 22:36.315
That's a common fishing blunder.

22:38.025 --> 22:39.568
So he's good?

22:39.693 --> 22:41.653
Yeah, he's good.

22:42.321 --> 22:45.115
I can tell him hello for you if you want.

22:45.157 --> 22:46.492
Whatever.

22:48.202 --> 22:49.536
Thank you.

22:53.081 --> 22:56.752
- My God. This is really good.
- I'm glad you like it.

22:57.419 --> 22:59.671
- So, how much time you got?
- I got a bit.

22:59.713 --> 23:01.673
There's a record store
you should check out.

23:01.715 --> 23:04.510
It's run by this insane freak
who's a walking encyclopedia...

23:04.593 --> 23:07.679
for every punk and garage band record
ever made.

23:07.763 --> 23:11.183
Catalog numbers. He's crazy.
The place is right out of High Fidelity.

23:11.225 --> 23:12.851
- Let's go.
- Okay.

23:14.019 --> 23:15.604
Where you going?

23:15.687 --> 23:17.814
- Subway.
- I thought we were gonna walk.

23:17.856 --> 23:20.692
It's 15 blocks.
Come on, I think you'll like it.

23:20.734 --> 23:24.947
- Do they allow hot dogs in the subway?
- You are so an out-of-towner.

23:44.716 --> 23:46.844
Excuse me. Hi. I'm one of the graduates.

23:46.927 --> 23:48.887
Wow. You're hours early.

23:49.721 --> 23:51.682
I just wanted to beat traffic...

23:51.765 --> 23:54.476
and have time to get ready and relax
and also I've heard...

23:54.560 --> 23:57.896
the early bird gets the unwrinkled gowns
without the mysterious stains.

23:57.938 --> 24:01.108
- This is true. Take your pick.
- Thank you.

24:04.945 --> 24:08.198
This is so exciting. Isn't this exciting?

24:08.240 --> 24:10.284
This is my eighth year of doing this.

24:10.367 --> 24:12.870
So not so exciting for you. Got it.

24:31.722 --> 24:35.100
You're being so cryptic.
Do you need a power source or not?

24:35.142 --> 24:39.146
My batteries are all fully charged.
It just depends on how fast they deplete.

24:39.229 --> 24:42.024
- So we need one just in case.
- Mom.

24:42.608 --> 24:46.361
Lorelai, it's hours before the ceremony.
What are you doing here?

24:46.445 --> 24:49.615
I'm sorry, what are you doing here?
How do you even know about this?

24:49.698 --> 24:52.409
I shouldn't know about this?
A mother can't know about this?

24:52.451 --> 24:54.411
- No, I just mean...
- You're graduating.

24:54.453 --> 24:56.830
- I know.
- So we're here to see you graduate.

24:56.914 --> 24:58.415
This is Raul.

24:59.041 --> 25:01.210
So you and Raul
are just here to see me graduate.

25:01.293 --> 25:03.629
Don't be silly.
Your father will be joining me later.

25:03.712 --> 25:06.715
- My father?
- Yes. Remember him? Tall, bow tie.

25:06.798 --> 25:10.636
I remember Dad, Mom. I just...
Rory told you.

25:10.677 --> 25:13.639
Yes. That's okay, isn't it?
It's a little late if it's not.

25:13.680 --> 25:17.351
No, it's perfectly fine that you're here.
Absolutely. I'm just surprised.

25:17.434 --> 25:19.061
- Who are you?
- I'm Raul.

25:19.144 --> 25:22.147
- I just told you that.
- Did Rory invite Raul, too?

25:22.231 --> 25:24.066
Raul is my cameraman.

25:25.150 --> 25:26.485
Cameraman?

25:26.568 --> 25:29.863
He'll be filming the ceremony for us.
He's very talented.

25:29.947 --> 25:34.409
He screened an independent film of his
as an audition. Welcome to Scabland.

25:34.493 --> 25:36.912
It was disgusting,
but beautifully photographed.

25:36.995 --> 25:39.665
- It was supposed to be disgusting.
- I'm sure it was.

25:39.706 --> 25:41.291
Mom, all this stuff.

25:41.333 --> 25:44.294
Excuse me. All of this equipment,
it can't be here.

25:44.336 --> 25:47.714
We won't leave all of this equipment here
for everybody to trip over.

25:47.798 --> 25:49.007
We are not cretins.

25:49.049 --> 25:51.343
She's handling it.
Right, Mom, you are handling it?

25:51.385 --> 25:54.179
- This lighting sucks.
- Can we do something about the lighting?

25:54.263 --> 25:56.265
I don't think so, ma'am. I don't know.

25:56.348 --> 25:59.476
It's a community college,
we'll have to cope. Think documentary.

25:59.518 --> 26:02.521
Mom, please.
People will be showing up here soon.

26:02.563 --> 26:05.482
Lorelai, I'm perfectly capable
of handling this.

26:05.524 --> 26:07.734
No one will be inconvenienced.

26:08.318 --> 26:11.822
Okay. I'm just gonna
let everyone deal with all of this...

26:11.864 --> 26:14.575
because I need to relax
and get a cup of coffee...

26:14.658 --> 26:16.952
and maybe hammer a nail into my head.

26:17.035 --> 26:20.747
You're not needed here, Lorelai.
Go get your coffee. Relax.

26:22.166 --> 26:24.793
You're going to redo
your makeup later, aren't you?

26:24.877 --> 26:26.753
Maybe an Irish coffee.

26:32.092 --> 26:33.927
I haven't even heard of half these bands.

26:34.011 --> 26:37.723
I love that about this place.
Lane would want to live here.

26:39.892 --> 26:41.310
Who's Slint?

26:42.019 --> 26:44.730
- I don't know.
- Grunge band out of Kentucky.

26:44.771 --> 26:48.734
Two albums plus a double 'A' side single.
Disbanded in '94.

26:49.193 --> 26:50.402
Thanks.

26:55.199 --> 26:57.075
- My God.
- What?

26:57.409 --> 26:59.536
- Look.
- The Go-Go's.

26:59.870 --> 27:02.581
- You must have that one.
- No. For my mom.

27:02.664 --> 27:05.417
This was her favorite group
when she was my age.

27:05.501 --> 27:06.919
It's signed by Belinda.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.254
This would be
the perfect graduation present.

27:09.296 --> 27:12.299
I've been looking all week long,
and I couldn't find anything.

27:12.382 --> 27:14.384
- Now I have Belinda.
- Graduation?

27:14.468 --> 27:16.386
From college. From business classes.

27:16.428 --> 27:18.263
I'm surprised she has time for anything...

27:18.347 --> 27:21.225
except lighting darts on fire
and throwing them at my picture.

27:21.266 --> 27:23.393
It's not a lot of time, but...

27:23.435 --> 27:27.314
- Go on. Get it. She'll like it.
- Thank you so much for bringing me here.

27:27.397 --> 27:29.274
- This was fate.
- I think it was.

27:29.358 --> 27:32.152
And in return,
I just might show you my withering stare.

27:32.236 --> 27:33.862
I'm a lucky man.

27:41.620 --> 27:44.665
- I think this one's mine.
- Yep. The sign says 'Booneville. '

27:44.748 --> 27:48.335
Excuse me. I'm so sorry to bother you.
Which way is 44th?

27:48.418 --> 27:50.587
- That way.
- Great. Thanks.

27:51.380 --> 27:53.298
- I got asked directions.
- I saw.

27:53.340 --> 27:55.676
He took me for a native. That's so cool.

27:55.759 --> 27:58.762
That's very impressive.
44th is the other way.

27:58.846 --> 28:00.138
- No.
- It's all right.

28:00.180 --> 28:01.890
Man, I should go find him.

28:01.974 --> 28:04.810
He'll figure it out when he sees
the numbers getting smaller.

28:04.852 --> 28:06.770
He still thought I was a native. That's cool.

28:06.812 --> 28:08.146
I'm your witness.

28:08.188 --> 28:10.232
- Well, I should go.
- Okay.

28:11.400 --> 28:13.235
I got to go to my mom's graduation.

28:13.318 --> 28:16.280
- And give her Belinda.
- And give her Belinda.

28:16.613 --> 28:18.574
Go on. I'll check on the guy.

28:18.657 --> 28:22.286
I'll make sure he's not
wandering around looking for 44th.

28:29.960 --> 28:31.837
Why did you come here?

28:33.672 --> 28:36.258
- What?
- I said, why did you come here?

28:36.842 --> 28:41.138
You ditched school and everything.
That's so not you. Why'd you do it?

28:43.015 --> 28:45.309
Because you didn't say goodbye.

28:50.189 --> 28:51.523
Goodbye, Rory.

28:52.024 --> 28:53.400
Bye, Jess.

29:07.456 --> 29:11.835
- Great. I'm Woody Allen in Annie Hall.
- You thought ahead. Smart.

29:12.085 --> 29:13.879
The mirror. Yeah.

29:13.962 --> 29:16.215
I never leave home
without all the essentials:

29:16.256 --> 29:18.842
Mirror, makeup, picture of Shaun Cassidy.

29:18.884 --> 29:21.595
- I'm done. Do you want to use it?
- Thanks.

29:23.138 --> 29:25.265
- Don't I look charming?
- You look great.

29:25.349 --> 29:28.727
I looked better. I had to run here
straight from work. Kinko's.

29:28.769 --> 29:30.312
Hey, Liza. That gets me thinking.

29:30.395 --> 29:33.565
Maybe you and I ought to do
a little reproducing after the ceremony.

29:33.649 --> 29:35.108
- Clever.
- Don't be a snot.

29:35.192 --> 29:36.401
Shut up.

29:36.735 --> 29:38.946
- That's my boyfriend, Zach.
- Sure.

29:39.029 --> 29:42.032
We're breaking up'cause
we're transferring to different schools.

29:42.115 --> 29:44.201
He's going to Florida State.
I'm going to UMass.

29:44.284 --> 29:46.078
Although I'm gonna miss this place.

29:46.161 --> 29:49.164
- I'm not. This place stunk. It's bush-league.
- Why'd you go here?

29:49.248 --> 29:52.584
My parents, wise investors that they are,
couldn't afford anything else.

29:52.668 --> 29:56.129
Yeah, that 2.0 grade-point average
didn't reason into things.

29:56.213 --> 29:57.506
- Shut up.
- Between the lines.

29:57.589 --> 29:58.757
Go die.

29:59.758 --> 30:03.136
Sure you don't wanna give it another go,
'cause you're darling together?

30:03.220 --> 30:05.722
- Thanks for the mirror.
- My pleasure.

30:07.057 --> 30:10.894
Hey, a bunch of us are
going to Shaky's afterwards for pizza.

30:10.936 --> 30:12.312
You want to come?

30:12.396 --> 30:15.399
I'm going out with my daughter after,
but it sounds like fun.

30:15.440 --> 30:18.944
You won't believe this. There's some
blue-blooded rich woman out there...

30:19.027 --> 30:22.406
setting up professional film equipment
like she's shooting a movie.

30:22.447 --> 30:24.658
- You're kidding.
- Whose mother is it?

30:24.741 --> 30:27.619
I don't know. Little precious
must be around here somewhere.

30:27.703 --> 30:31.498
- I hate people with money.
- So do I, with every fiber of my being.

30:31.582 --> 30:33.959
Me, too. Money people.

30:47.806 --> 30:49.808
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

30:49.850 --> 30:53.061
- Are we leaving soon?
- I have no idea.

30:53.145 --> 30:55.063
Should you have an idea?

30:55.147 --> 30:57.649
There was an accident,
closed the interstate.

30:57.733 --> 31:00.652
All outbound buses
were told to stand down.

31:01.612 --> 31:04.615
And you don't know when
we're gonna be allowed to stand up again?

31:04.656 --> 31:07.576
Soon, I hope. I hate missing dinner.

31:08.327 --> 31:09.828
Yeah. Me, too.

31:21.215 --> 31:24.510
There's our little graduate.
My God, look at that gown.

31:24.551 --> 31:26.428
You look just like the Statue of Liberty.

31:26.512 --> 31:29.348
- All big and stony?
- No. You look amazing.

31:29.389 --> 31:30.641
You look very GQ.

31:30.682 --> 31:33.185
Thanks to my best new friend
Ermenegildo Zegna.

31:33.227 --> 31:35.187
Don't you love
how he can pronounce it now?

31:35.229 --> 31:36.271
Very cosmopolitan.

31:36.355 --> 31:39.107
He got it for the rehearsal dinner.
It's his first real suit.

31:39.191 --> 31:41.026
And not my last. I look hot.

31:41.109 --> 31:43.153
You know that Emily's out there, right?

31:43.362 --> 31:44.363
Why?

31:45.572 --> 31:47.533
- It's a long story. Just do me a favor.
- Sure.

31:47.616 --> 31:50.619
Keep an eye on my parents.
Make sure they don't disrupt anything.

31:50.702 --> 31:53.872
My mother doesn't behead anyone.
My father doesn't snore too loudly.

31:53.914 --> 31:56.542
- They won't do anything like that.
- Haven't you met them?

31:56.625 --> 31:59.628
- Why would they do that?
- They're here because Rory invited them.

31:59.711 --> 32:02.339
They can't say no to that little face.

32:02.381 --> 32:05.008
It's like hitting a puppy
with a rolled-up newspaper.

32:05.092 --> 32:06.927
You guys are not gonna believe this.

32:07.010 --> 32:10.389
- You're Mr. Announcement Guy today.
- You'll pipe in every time I talk?

32:10.430 --> 32:11.431
- Can it.
- Stuff it.

32:11.515 --> 32:12.599
- They're in love.
- Clearly.

32:12.683 --> 32:16.645
Mrs. Got Bucks out there not only has
a cameraman, she's got a sound guy, too.

32:16.728 --> 32:18.939
It's like a Baz Luhrmann movie out there.

32:19.022 --> 32:20.315
That's Emily, right?

32:20.399 --> 32:22.985
- Rich people feel so entitled.
- Yes, damn them.

32:23.068 --> 32:25.112
I saw her wipe her face with a $100 bill.

32:25.195 --> 32:28.157
We should line them up against a wall.
You know what I'm saying?

32:28.240 --> 32:30.617
- Is Lorelei Gilmore here?
- Yes.

32:30.701 --> 32:33.620
Good. Have a look at these, will you?

32:34.371 --> 32:37.040
- Wow. Pretty.
- Look them over and take your pick.

32:37.082 --> 32:38.292
- What for?
- To wear.

32:38.375 --> 32:41.086
- Are they for sale?
- No. They're paid for.

32:41.170 --> 32:43.297
These are from your mother,
Emily Gilmore.

32:43.380 --> 32:45.632
- Wow. Ritzy.
- I really don't want to wear a corsage.

32:45.716 --> 32:47.718
- They're all paid for.
- Really. It's too much.

32:47.801 --> 32:50.262
- Your mother wants you to pick one.
- Really, it's okay.

32:50.345 --> 32:51.889
She'll just come back here herself.

32:51.930 --> 32:54.266
- This one, thanks.
- Good choice.

32:54.349 --> 32:57.477
The cameraman said
that would look best on film.

32:57.769 --> 33:00.939
- So you're the rich girl.
- Maybe. I'm not rich...

33:01.023 --> 33:03.734
but my parents have money.
But I'm totally self-sufficient.

33:03.775 --> 33:07.279
I take nothing from them except
this corsage and my daughter's tuition.

33:07.362 --> 33:09.364
So, are you gonna stone me?

33:09.448 --> 33:11.283
I should've guessed. Look at her friends.

33:11.366 --> 33:12.993
They're wearing suits that drip money.

33:13.076 --> 33:14.912
Hey, pal, this was 30% off.

33:14.953 --> 33:18.081
That's why you didn't want to get pizza
'cause it's below you?

33:18.123 --> 33:20.542
No, Liza. Pizza is not below me.

33:20.626 --> 33:24.963
I love pizza. I eat tons of pizza.
It's one of my four major food groups.

33:25.047 --> 33:27.090
Candy, popcorn, and pizza.

33:27.132 --> 33:30.093
See. It's two of my food groups.
That's how much I love pizza.

33:30.135 --> 33:31.220
I want to believe you.

33:31.303 --> 33:34.097
Enjoy your champagne and caviar
at the Ritz, Your Highness.

33:34.139 --> 33:35.599
I am not rich.

33:37.601 --> 33:38.644
My pager.

33:38.727 --> 33:42.481
- Maybe this suit was a little much.
- You're a fox. Now, don't start.

33:42.523 --> 33:43.982
- No.
- What?

33:44.024 --> 33:45.859
- Rory's running late.
- Late from what?

33:45.943 --> 33:47.069
She doesn't say.

33:47.152 --> 33:50.823
She'll be here, but if she's not here
by 7:00, she'll sneak in the back.

33:50.906 --> 33:52.866
- That's weird.
- She'll be here. Don't worry.

33:52.950 --> 33:53.951
I hope so.

33:54.034 --> 33:56.995
We'll sit in back, keep an eye out for her,
and save her a seat.

33:57.079 --> 34:00.499
Can you hang on to all my stuff for me?
I don't want to leave it in here.

34:00.582 --> 34:02.334
- Will do.
- Thank you.

34:02.417 --> 34:03.502
Bye.

34:03.585 --> 34:06.213
You don't trust your valuables
around us poor kids?

34:06.296 --> 34:08.047
Knock it off, Zach.

34:19.016 --> 34:20.811
You don't look happy.

34:20.853 --> 34:23.522
- I'm late.
- These buses are the worst.

34:23.605 --> 34:25.315
Why are we making so many stops?

34:25.357 --> 34:27.693
The bus didn't make stops
on the way into the city.

34:27.734 --> 34:32.114
That was probably an express.
This is a local. It makes a lot of stops.

34:32.197 --> 34:35.324
I should have checked the schedule.
I should have checked traffic.

34:35.367 --> 34:38.370
Note to self:
Lmpulsive definitely does not work for me.

34:38.411 --> 34:40.205
What are you doing?

34:40.621 --> 34:43.500
- It's for my spit.
- Your what?

34:43.876 --> 34:45.293
For my smokeless.

34:48.880 --> 34:51.382
Victor David Fuller.

34:53.467 --> 34:56.221
Nancy Brenda Gatson.

35:00.893 --> 35:04.521
Making sure the camera's
getting your best side, princess?

35:05.480 --> 35:08.483
Are you telling me that that is
the best commencement speaker...

35:08.567 --> 35:09.610
they can scrounge up?

35:09.693 --> 35:11.653
I hope RauI's getting
enough shots of Lorelai.

35:11.737 --> 35:14.072
I don't want the whole damn ceremony
and none of her.

35:14.156 --> 35:17.201
I disagree. I hope he gets
every inspired word...

35:17.242 --> 35:21.288
articulated by the East Coast
Marketing Director of Pup 'n' Taco.

35:27.920 --> 35:29.338
Oh, jeez.

35:30.464 --> 35:32.966
John Lawrence Gilfer.

35:35.427 --> 35:38.096
Lorelai Victoria Gilmore.

36:04.289 --> 36:06.333
Hey. Mom, Dad.

36:06.959 --> 36:08.126
Lorelai.

36:08.210 --> 36:10.921
- Well, I did it.
- Yes.

36:12.297 --> 36:14.591
Raul thinks he got some good footage.

36:14.633 --> 36:16.635
I should hope so. He certainly cost enough.

36:16.718 --> 36:17.803
I'm sure it'll be great.

36:17.886 --> 36:20.389
- Congratulations, Lorelai.
- Thank you.

36:20.472 --> 36:22.349
I'm glad you guys came.

36:22.432 --> 36:24.768
Yes, well, we should get going.

36:25.018 --> 36:27.938
I guess we'll see you tomorrow for dinner.

36:30.649 --> 36:31.984
Hey, wait.

36:32.025 --> 36:34.319
- Aren't we gonna take a picture?
- Excuse me?

36:34.361 --> 36:37.114
The three of us.
Me in the middle with the gown.

36:37.156 --> 36:39.158
You know, the traditional pose.

36:39.199 --> 36:42.327
Well, we don't have a camera with us.

36:42.828 --> 36:44.163
Hold on.

36:45.998 --> 36:47.833
- That's a camera?
- That's a camera.

36:47.875 --> 36:49.501
It looks like a toy.

36:49.585 --> 36:51.420
Raul, would you mind?

37:00.762 --> 37:03.974
Okay, on the count of one, two, three.

37:04.183 --> 37:05.475
Cheese.

37:08.437 --> 37:09.813
Thank you.

37:10.689 --> 37:12.691
Yes, well, tomorrow then.

37:13.192 --> 37:14.568
Absolutely.

37:14.943 --> 37:16.653
Let's go, Richard.

37:17.279 --> 37:19.364
I'll be right there, Emily.

37:22.159 --> 37:23.744
Congratulations.

37:24.786 --> 37:28.457
- You don't have to do this.
- Put it towards something fun.

37:29.333 --> 37:30.959
Thank you, Daddy.

37:35.714 --> 37:39.343
- We're so proud of you.
- Yeah. You were great up there.

37:39.384 --> 37:41.720
Thanks, you guys. Where's Rory?

37:42.971 --> 37:45.891
- No Rory?
- She called your cell, and I answered.

37:45.974 --> 37:49.102
She said she got hung up on something
and she'll see you at home.

37:49.186 --> 37:52.189
Hung up where? Is she okay?

37:52.231 --> 37:55.192
She said she's fine. She's sorry, but fine.

37:57.319 --> 37:59.655
As long as she's okay, I guess.

38:00.864 --> 38:03.075
Well, I should probably get the gown back.

38:03.158 --> 38:05.702
Thanks for coming,
Sook, Marcus Schenkenberg.

38:05.744 --> 38:07.830
You want to go out to eat?
Celebrate a little?

38:07.913 --> 38:11.083
- I think I'll just go home to Rory.
- I thought so.

38:11.166 --> 38:13.210
- See you tomorrow.
- Thanks.

38:15.838 --> 38:17.339
Wait a minute.

38:17.422 --> 38:20.926
Aspirins instead of Jordan almonds?
But we already bought the almonds.

38:21.009 --> 38:23.804
Now, that's the longest
anything's ever taken.

38:23.887 --> 38:26.974
My family's not gonna get the joke.
Can't we just use the almonds?

38:27.057 --> 38:29.059
Okay, sweetie, calm down.

38:40.904 --> 38:43.031
I'm so sorry.

38:43.115 --> 38:44.575
- You're okay, right?
- Yes.

38:44.616 --> 38:47.661
Everything's working.
Your wrist is okay. Nothing new is broken.

38:47.744 --> 38:48.745
I'm fine.

38:48.829 --> 38:51.248
Anyone you know,
like Lane, get sick today...

38:51.290 --> 38:53.792
or break an arm themselves,
or get in a car wreck?

38:53.834 --> 38:55.169
- No.
- Okay, good.

38:55.252 --> 38:57.921
Then I can get past worried
and move on to the other things.

38:58.005 --> 38:59.923
- I know you're hurt.
- You bet I'm hurt.

38:59.965 --> 39:02.259
I really wanted you there today.
More than anything.

39:02.301 --> 39:04.720
You're why I did this stupid thing
in the first place.

39:04.803 --> 39:06.263
It was a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

39:06.305 --> 39:07.389
You should've been there.

39:07.472 --> 39:09.975
My best friend should have been there.
Whatever it was...

39:10.058 --> 39:12.603
you should have gotten out of it.
At least this once.

39:12.644 --> 39:14.771
- Was it school?
- It wasn't school.

39:14.813 --> 39:16.440
- Was it Paris?
- It wasn't Paris.

39:16.481 --> 39:17.900
- What was it?
- So stupid.

39:17.983 --> 39:19.735
Where were you? What happened?

39:19.818 --> 39:21.778
- I cut school.
- You what?

39:21.820 --> 39:26.325
I cut school, and I got on a bus,
and I don't even know why I did it.

39:26.617 --> 39:28.202
I have no excuse.

39:28.285 --> 39:32.289
I was just standing outside of Chilton,
and I must have had a stroke.

39:32.372 --> 39:35.584
- What does a stroke feel like?
- I don't know. Not good, probably.

39:35.667 --> 39:39.046
I left school and I got on a bus
and I went to New York.

39:39.129 --> 39:42.674
That's it. I'm grounded
for six months or seven.

39:42.758 --> 39:44.801
And no TV, no stereo, no reading.

39:44.885 --> 39:47.679
In fact, take all of my books away from me
and lock them up.

39:47.763 --> 39:49.264
Hold on, you went to New York?

39:49.348 --> 39:53.560
And no magazines, either.
I'll do all the housework. Laundry, dishes.

39:53.644 --> 39:56.063
We're gonna start eating at home
so we have dishes.

39:56.146 --> 39:58.106
Rory, stop. Why did you go to New York?

39:58.190 --> 40:00.651
- To see Jess.
- Boy, do you know how to bury the lead.

40:00.692 --> 40:03.612
- I don't know what happened.
- You went to New York to see Jess.

40:03.695 --> 40:05.572
It was a stroke. It made me someone else.

40:05.656 --> 40:08.408
- After his phone call last night...
- That was him?

40:08.492 --> 40:10.494
...it did something to me.
I don't know what.

40:10.536 --> 40:12.913
In fact, you should take the phone
away from me, too.

40:12.996 --> 40:16.291
That's right. Add it to the list.
No books, no music, no phone.

40:16.375 --> 40:19.461
- I'm a horrible person.
- You're not a horrible person.

40:19.545 --> 40:22.464
I'm sick. I'm ill. I'm cracked.
This is not who I am.

40:22.548 --> 40:25.467
If I were to write this down in my diary
and I would read it...

40:25.551 --> 40:28.929
I would be like, 'Who is this freak?
This isn't me. This isn't my diary. '

40:29.012 --> 40:32.182
I wouldn't skip school
when I had finals coming up...

40:32.266 --> 40:34.059
to go see a guy that isn't even my guy...

40:34.142 --> 40:38.188
and miss my mother's graduation,
which I wanted to be at so badly.

40:38.272 --> 40:39.565
That's someone else.

40:39.606 --> 40:42.860
That's someone flighty,
and stupid, and dumb, and girlie.

40:42.901 --> 40:44.778
I mean, I missed your graduation...

40:44.862 --> 40:47.489
which is the worst thing
I could have possibly done.

40:47.573 --> 40:50.909
I hurt you,
and I had to spend hours on a stinky bus...

40:50.993 --> 40:53.412
next to a guy
that was spitting into a can...

40:53.495 --> 40:57.040
thinking about all the minutes going by
that I wasn't at your graduation...

40:57.124 --> 40:59.126
and they were hurting you...

40:59.209 --> 41:03.172
because it was so selfish of this person
who wasn't me to do what she did.

41:03.255 --> 41:05.716
- Take a breath.
- I don't deserve a breath.

41:05.799 --> 41:08.093
No breaths.
You should add that to the list.

41:08.135 --> 41:11.763
You should beat me, ground me, take
the phone away, and deprive me of air.

41:11.847 --> 41:14.975
Okay, look, nobody wants
to say this any less than me...

41:15.058 --> 41:18.687
but maybe you don't have
a medical condition or a mental problem.

41:18.770 --> 41:21.398
Maybe, honey, you are falling for Jess.

41:21.481 --> 41:24.943
No. I love Dean. Dean is my boyfriend.

41:24.985 --> 41:28.071
He will always be my boyfriend.
That's it. Forever.

41:28.113 --> 41:30.741
- Maybe not forever.
- Yes. Forever. I love Dean.

41:30.824 --> 41:33.160
Jess is gone now.
Everything's gonna be good again.

41:33.243 --> 41:35.787
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- Rory, you cut school.

41:35.871 --> 41:39.917
You got on a bus and went to
a strange city in your uniform to see Jess.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.043
I know.

41:41.126 --> 41:43.545
That doesn't mean nothing.
That means something.

41:43.629 --> 41:46.048
No. I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

41:46.131 --> 41:47.966
The only thing I want to talk about...

41:48.050 --> 41:51.678
is the list I made on the bus
of all the ways I'll make this up to you.

41:51.762 --> 41:55.641
'You get total control over the remote
and the stereo for as long as you want.

41:55.682 --> 41:57.768
'Total control over takeout food choices...

41:57.809 --> 42:00.312
'and a special surprise present every day
for a month. '

42:00.354 --> 42:03.899
- My God. I left your present on the bus.
- What present?

42:03.982 --> 42:07.653
It was a vinyl copy of the Go-Go's
original album signed by Belinda.

42:07.736 --> 42:10.280
But it's not the only copy.
I'm gonna find another copy.

42:10.364 --> 42:11.782
That's going on the list, too.

42:11.824 --> 42:14.368
Honey, please.
Forget about the list until tomorrow.

42:14.451 --> 42:17.454
Okay, I'll just go to bed then.
I'll go to my room.

42:17.496 --> 42:19.248
Hold on one second.

42:19.331 --> 42:21.250
Does this mean I have to eat alone?

42:21.333 --> 42:24.002
It's up to you.
Sending me to bed without supper.

42:24.086 --> 42:26.421
You can't lose with that punishment.
It's a classic.

42:26.505 --> 42:28.340
I'd rather go out
with my daughter tonight.

42:28.382 --> 42:31.677
- I don't deserve it.
- No. But I do.

42:32.177 --> 42:34.221
Okay, just let me take a shower...

42:34.304 --> 42:36.932
and get the horrible smell
of this horrible day off of me.

42:37.015 --> 42:40.352
Then we'll go anywhere you want.
My treat. And I won't enjoy it.

42:40.435 --> 42:42.771
Then we'll come home,
and I'll go straight to bed...

42:42.855 --> 42:44.565
and have a terrible night's sleep, okay?

42:44.648 --> 42:45.858
Sounds great.

42:49.695 --> 42:51.613
I'm so, so sorry, Mom.

42:53.323 --> 42:54.741
Really?

42:55.659 --> 42:58.078
'Cause you didn't make that clear.

42:58.954 --> 43:00.581
I won't be long.

43:42.748 --> 43:43.707
