00:43.793 --> 00:46.670
I'm ready to bring him to you.

00:57.390 --> 01:03.854
Finally.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.699
Mr. Proctor.

02:43.246 --> 02:44.496
Hello, Kai.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.337
Hold the work. Clear the room.

02:55.884 --> 02:57.843
I'll call you guys later.

03:02.390 --> 03:04.266
Would you excuse us, Burton?

03:14.819 --> 03:16.278
Last time you spoke to me...

03:16.446 --> 03:18.614
...we were pulling yams
in your father's field.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.783
You barely even had that beard yet.

03:21.951 --> 03:24.328
I've come to talk to you about Rebecca.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.123
How is your daughter?

03:28.291 --> 03:30.167
There's no need to pretend.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.920
I know that she talks to you.

03:33.087 --> 03:36.381
She defies every other rule,
so why not that one?

03:43.223 --> 03:45.307
I wouldn't have come if I didn't think...

03:49.229 --> 03:51.897
She is my daughter and I love her.

03:52.065 --> 03:55.609
But she is getting lost.

03:56.027 --> 03:58.070
What happened to you...

03:58.238 --> 04:00.530
...has saddened me.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.117
I don't want to lose her.

04:06.204 --> 04:07.955
I understand.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.749
She trusts you.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.418
And because of that...

04:14.254 --> 04:16.838
...maybe she would listen to you.

04:18.049 --> 04:19.591
Maybe she would.

04:20.176 --> 04:21.510
Good.

04:23.012 --> 04:24.721
I still pray for you, Kai.

04:34.107 --> 04:37.401
And they were carrots, not yams.

04:59.465 --> 05:03.302
- Don't you got to get going?
- Mm.

05:03.469 --> 05:06.346
I don't think a few kids
in Saturday detention...

05:06.514 --> 05:09.850
...will be too crushed if I'm a little late.

05:22.780 --> 05:24.197
- Hey.
- What's wrong?

05:24.365 --> 05:28.410
Ah, nothing. I'm just distracted.

05:30.621 --> 05:33.165
You've been distracted for the last year, Dan.

05:33.333 --> 05:37.044
Yeah, well, there's a lot going on at work.

05:37.712 --> 05:40.464
Well, what about what's going on here?

05:40.631 --> 05:43.300
Or not going on, actually.

05:43.468 --> 05:46.595
Well, I'm just a little bit stressed out.

05:49.015 --> 05:52.100
Okay. I've got to go to work.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.318
Four casino guards...

06:01.486 --> 06:03.612
...two drivers, and another in the back.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.656
I've studied the photos and the schematics.

06:06.824 --> 06:10.327
And it's like I said,
we ain't getting into that truck once it's closed.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.788
Well, we can't take them
in that loading bay...

06:12.955 --> 06:15.916
...if that's what you're thinking.
We'd be dead inside a minute.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.334
You got a better idea?

06:17.502 --> 06:19.878
Yeah, anything but that.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.631
Can we please set you up
with a computer and Quicken or some shit?

06:22.799 --> 06:24.841
Looking at you is like watching
the History Channel.

06:25.009 --> 06:29.012
You of all people should know
that computers are not secure.

06:29.180 --> 06:32.849
Yeah, there's a million hackers in China
just dying to get their hands on your financials.

06:33.017 --> 06:35.852
These aren't rent-a-cops. This is Longshadow's
hand-vetted security team.

06:36.020 --> 06:37.938
- They'll die for him.
- So, what then?

06:39.690 --> 06:42.025
We need a friend in the truck.

06:42.193 --> 06:44.027
Lord, I was afraid you were gonna say that.

06:44.195 --> 06:45.570
Hood.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.119
I'll be there.

06:58.459 --> 07:00.585
Oh, for fuck's sake, I know it was her.

07:00.753 --> 07:03.171
I can hear your heart beating from here.

07:04.006 --> 07:08.635
- She says she has a fence for the stones.
- Just like that? Fucking spectacular.

07:08.803 --> 07:10.762
After 15 years,
she just suddenly found someone.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.264
That's what she said, Job.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.933
There is no fence, man. You know it.

07:18.062 --> 07:19.563
Maybe not.

07:19.814 --> 07:21.940
Then why are you going?

07:22.108 --> 07:24.109
- Because it's her.
- She is not her anymore.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.528
And whoever she is,
she's gonna get you killed.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.363
We'll see.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.868
There is pussy-whipped and then there is
that hopeless motherfucker.

07:34.245 --> 07:35.537
Oh, for fuck's sake.

07:45.506 --> 07:46.673
Hey.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.468
Just like old times.

07:49.635 --> 07:52.220
Don't get too attached.
This is just unfinished business.

07:52.388 --> 07:54.347
We got no shortage of that, right?

08:10.865 --> 08:12.199
Where'd you find these guys?

08:12.366 --> 08:14.701
I started putting out feelers
when you came to town.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.912
A guy in Jersey came through.

08:18.915 --> 08:21.875
- You trust him?
- If I trusted him, you wouldn't be coming along.

08:23.127 --> 08:25.837
God, you were always better at this than me.

08:31.219 --> 08:32.511
Fuck!

08:32.678 --> 08:34.429
I'm sorry.

08:36.057 --> 08:38.099
- Ana, what are you doing?
- What I have to do.

08:38.267 --> 08:39.768
Oh, fuck.

08:41.562 --> 08:42.771
I'm sorry.

08:43.773 --> 08:44.814
Fuck.

08:58.329 --> 09:01.456
Well, honey, is there a particular brand
you want? I mean...

09:01.624 --> 09:04.751
Well, how about whichever
one gives us a yes, huh?

09:06.420 --> 09:08.713
All right, baby. Bye.

09:15.596 --> 09:17.180
Fuck my shit.

09:17.348 --> 09:20.392
- Don't fucking move!
- Okay. Just calm down.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.227
Shut the fuck up, cop!

09:22.395 --> 09:24.479
Keep your hands up, motherfucker.

09:24.647 --> 09:25.772
No! Jesus!

09:25.940 --> 09:28.024
Lance, was that fucking necessary?

09:28.192 --> 09:30.777
- He reached for something.
- Please, let me help him.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.737
Get on your fucking knees.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.823
Get on your fucking knees!

09:34.991 --> 09:36.700
Please, no.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.744
- Fuck me.
- Finish him!

09:39.912 --> 09:42.539
Finish him! Let's go!

09:42.707 --> 09:44.207
Fuck me.

09:45.751 --> 09:48.086
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not be in want.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.505
Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

09:50.673 --> 09:53.091
...I shall fear no evil, for thou art with me.

09:53.259 --> 09:56.303
Surely goodness, mercy, and love
will follow me all the days of my life...

09:56.470 --> 09:59.222
...and I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.776
Alma, I've got a robbery in progress.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.779
Shots fired and a civilian down
in the drugstore.

10:21.203 --> 10:22.787
Go, go!

10:27.001 --> 10:29.461
Stop! Hey! Step away from that car!

10:38.971 --> 10:40.972
You should've finished him
in the store, you pussy.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.974
It was a highly charged situation.

10:43.142 --> 10:44.768
And what do you call this?

10:44.935 --> 10:47.145
Killing a cop has ramifications.

10:47.313 --> 10:48.605
Jesus! Fuck!

11:00.076 --> 11:01.534
Sir, are you all right?

11:01.702 --> 11:05.747
Okay, look, stay here. I'll call an ambulance.

11:05.915 --> 11:08.583
Alma, they're on foot heading towards
the Oak Street parking garage.

11:15.383 --> 11:18.009
Brock, they just crossed Oak Street.
Repeat, they just crossed Oak.

11:36.237 --> 11:38.196
That fucker is still coming.

11:41.117 --> 11:44.869
Suspects heading towards
Banshee High School gymnasium.

11:47.456 --> 11:49.666
I said stop!

11:49.834 --> 11:51.876
- No!
- Come here!

11:52.044 --> 11:54.295
No! No!

11:54.463 --> 11:56.798
- Aah!
- Let her go now!

11:56.966 --> 11:58.466
Ow, fuck!

11:58.634 --> 12:00.009
No!

12:00.177 --> 12:04.097
Do you have any idea
what kind of shitshow you just started?

12:04.265 --> 12:07.976
One of these days we're gonna find you
a functioning set of balls.

12:08.144 --> 12:11.020
Oh, great. Good old BHS.

12:11.188 --> 12:12.605
Shit, more cops.

12:19.739 --> 12:20.947
Help him up!

12:21.115 --> 12:22.741
They ain't gonna come in.

12:22.908 --> 12:25.160
Not when we have us a hostage.

12:25.327 --> 12:28.037
Mrs. Kendall?

12:28.456 --> 12:31.291
- What the fuck is this?
- It's detention.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.126
Get down here now!

12:33.294 --> 12:36.004
Get down from there!
Get up! Move your ass!

12:37.465 --> 12:39.132
Get over here!

12:42.178 --> 12:43.720
Now!

13:02.281 --> 13:03.490
Well, this is new.

13:03.657 --> 13:05.992
I must have gotten the dosage wrong.

13:06.660 --> 13:08.620
You shouldn't have woken up yet.

13:08.788 --> 13:09.788
You called him?

13:09.955 --> 13:12.707
I gave you every chance to leave.
I begged you.

13:13.542 --> 13:15.084
I didn't want to leave.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.632
I would tell you to think
about what you're doing...

13:20.800 --> 13:22.383
...but I'm guessing you already have.

13:22.551 --> 13:24.093
I'm protecting my family.

13:24.261 --> 13:26.471
You really think he won't come after you?

13:26.639 --> 13:28.139
That's the deal.

13:30.893 --> 13:34.395
He's gonna torture me to find you.

13:34.563 --> 13:36.064
And you're not gonna tell him.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.691
I'm gonna sing my fucking lungs out.

13:38.859 --> 13:41.069
- Goodbye.
- Hey.

13:41.862 --> 13:43.822
I'll catch up to you.

14:15.896 --> 14:17.146
Anything else?

14:17.314 --> 14:19.065
Yeah, one of them is named Lance.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.112
This place was like church to me.

14:25.531 --> 14:28.116
We were 1983 state champs.

14:30.661 --> 14:32.579
I started at point guard.

14:32.746 --> 14:37.166
You know how many points I averaged
a game, Future Horse?

14:37.668 --> 14:39.127
Twenty points.

14:40.462 --> 14:41.588
Nice.

14:41.755 --> 14:43.464
Goddamn nice.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.217
Get down. Get down.

14:48.637 --> 14:49.888
Any movement in the front?

14:50.055 --> 14:52.098
No, all the doors are
chained up except this one.

14:52.266 --> 14:54.559
- Okay, that'll help us.
- Let me see this.

14:55.644 --> 14:57.145
Fuck.

14:57.313 --> 14:59.314
All the doors
are padlocked shut.

14:59.481 --> 15:01.691
There's no fucking way out of here.

15:02.985 --> 15:05.028
- Lance, can we focus?
- Can you get off my dick?

15:05.195 --> 15:07.196
We've got to get the fuck out of here.

15:07.364 --> 15:09.407
Oh, I forgot. You hate this place, don't you?

15:09.575 --> 15:13.119
- Hey, look what she's got.
- Hey, hey, hey!

15:14.997 --> 15:17.749
What, are you filming us? Feisty, huh?

15:17.917 --> 15:22.337
Leave her alone. They're just kids.

15:22.504 --> 15:25.048
But you're not, are you?

15:25.716 --> 15:27.884
- You called Hood, right?
- Hood's off today.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.761
He's out of town on personal business.

15:29.929 --> 15:33.181
- Brock, he's the sheriff.
- All right, fine.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.516
Alma, get me the sheriff.

15:35.684 --> 15:38.061
I've been trying him. No answer.

15:38.228 --> 15:39.604
Why am I not surprised?

15:39.772 --> 15:41.314
I just say we go in.

15:41.482 --> 15:42.982
No, we wait.

15:43.150 --> 15:45.401
They've already killed one person.
We're not rushing in.

15:45.569 --> 15:49.405
All right, listen, keep me here,
but let the students go.

15:51.283 --> 15:52.575
Get all their fucking phones.

15:52.743 --> 15:55.078
Give me your phones. Let's go.
Give me your phones!

15:55.245 --> 15:58.623
Siobhan, do another perimeter check,
all right?

15:58.791 --> 15:59.874
Check every window.

16:00.042 --> 16:02.794
Any movement in any room,
you radio in, all right?

16:07.758 --> 16:09.008
She all right?

16:09.176 --> 16:10.677
She's still coming around.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.516
Oh, shit.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.634
Hey! How we doing?

16:51.802 --> 16:54.929
They got fucking TV cameras
set up out there.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.765
This shit's getting out of control.

17:01.353 --> 17:03.021
Time to talk.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.481
Talk to who?

17:14.825 --> 17:16.034
You're on this, huh?

17:16.201 --> 17:18.327
I got the call from Harrisburg.
I was the closest man.

17:18.495 --> 17:20.705
I'm working at scrambling
a SWAT team from Philly.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.999
- All right.
- Where's Hood?

17:23.167 --> 17:24.709
He's out of town on personal business.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.128
We're trying to reach him,
but I can handle this.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.255
- Brock.
- Go for Lotus.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.924
I've got Janie Kendall,
the mayor's wife, on the line.

17:32.092 --> 17:34.093
- She's with the gunmen.
- Put her through.

17:34.261 --> 17:37.638
Janie, this is Brock Lotus. You okay?

17:38.766 --> 17:40.016
Janie?

17:41.351 --> 17:42.643
Tell him it's simple.

17:43.645 --> 17:46.064
He says to tell you it's simple.

17:47.858 --> 17:49.692
We want a car and an easy way out.

17:49.860 --> 17:52.028
They want a car with a way out.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.113
We want it within an hour.

17:54.281 --> 17:56.741
They want it within an hour.

18:00.704 --> 18:02.830
Or bad things will happen in here.

18:05.876 --> 18:07.877
Or bad things will happen.

18:08.879 --> 18:11.089
Janie, is everyone all right in there?

18:12.674 --> 18:14.383
Just tell him to get the fucking car.

18:14.551 --> 18:15.968
Who's with you?

18:16.136 --> 18:18.346
Get the fucking car.

18:32.277 --> 18:35.947
A gangster named Kassin killed my father.

18:36.115 --> 18:40.451
I heard soon after that he'd left Ukraine
and gone to Kunda.

18:40.619 --> 18:44.622
I went there, but I couldn't find him.

18:45.249 --> 18:49.293
Then a few years later...

18:49.461 --> 18:51.879
...I was in Yalta on business.

18:52.756 --> 18:55.424
I turned the corner...

18:55.592 --> 18:57.677
...and there was Kassin...

18:58.470 --> 19:00.555
...carrying a bottle of wine.

19:02.307 --> 19:04.392
We saw each other at the same moment.

19:04.560 --> 19:08.521
It was like two old friends
running into each other.

19:10.941 --> 19:14.026
I gutted him like a fish
right there in the street.

19:15.988 --> 19:20.825
That night I drank his wine with my dinner.

19:54.151 --> 19:56.068
We break from our regular program...

19:56.236 --> 19:58.154
...to go live to Banshee, Pennsylvania.

19:58.322 --> 19:59.739
Fuck!

20:00.282 --> 20:03.075
We're here outside Banshee
High School in Banshee, Pennsylvania.

20:03.243 --> 20:06.162
So far what we have to report
is that a pair of armed gunmen...

20:06.330 --> 20:08.497
...have taken hostages here
in the school's gymnasium...

20:08.665 --> 20:10.625
...after fleeing a robbery gone wrong.

20:10.792 --> 20:13.628
We know at least one person
has been killed at this time.

20:13.795 --> 20:16.172
One hostage posted a video
on her Facebook page...

20:16.340 --> 20:18.883
...and we have that footage.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.385
The police confirm
that they have been in contact...

20:21.553 --> 20:23.763
...with the gunmen, but are
releasing no information...

20:23.931 --> 20:25.556
...regarding the identity of the men...

20:31.188 --> 20:32.813
We are close, no?

20:32.981 --> 20:35.358
Just 15 miles.

20:43.450 --> 20:46.661
These are all the Lances
that Alma could find in our system.

20:46.828 --> 20:48.996
Lance McManus, Lance Hershler...

20:49.164 --> 20:52.333
...Lance Mangan.
- Him. Mangan.

20:52.501 --> 20:55.461
Jesus, I remember him.
He was a point guard back in the day.

20:55.629 --> 20:56.921
- A golden boy.
- Not anymore.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.215
He shot that cashier
like it was target practice.

20:59.383 --> 21:01.300
Brock! Brock!

21:01.468 --> 21:04.553
- What's going on?
- All right, listen. I talked to Janie. She's okay.

21:04.721 --> 21:06.180
All right? Gordon, hey.

21:06.348 --> 21:07.682
Deva's inside. She had detention.

21:07.849 --> 21:10.268
- We know.
- Where's the sheriff?

21:10.435 --> 21:12.019
What do we know?
What steps are you taking?

21:12.187 --> 21:14.146
Gordon, come on. Dan, please.

21:14.314 --> 21:16.565
Just stay back.
Stay back behind the barrier.

21:16.733 --> 21:18.567
For your own safety, all right?

21:23.615 --> 21:24.907
Come on, Carrie, pick up.

21:40.215 --> 21:41.590
What?

21:44.094 --> 21:45.469
Wait, what?

21:46.471 --> 21:48.180
What the fuck are you doing?

21:48.348 --> 21:49.598
Are you fucking with her?

21:51.685 --> 21:54.061
- No.
- Yes, you are. You're fucking with her.

21:54.229 --> 21:58.274
Instead of trying to get us out of here,
you're acting like a fucking asshole.

21:58.442 --> 21:59.483
Fuck you.

21:59.651 --> 22:02.069
Why'd you have to shoot
that goddamn cashier?

22:02.237 --> 22:04.030
He was reaching for something.

22:04.197 --> 22:05.698
I said I was sorry.

22:05.866 --> 22:07.950
Yeah, well, are you sorry
for all of this shit, huh?

22:08.118 --> 22:09.577
Because that's on you too.

22:09.745 --> 22:12.079
You know, you don't fucking
think shit through.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.877
Can we focus here?

22:22.716 --> 22:24.550
The police confirm
they have been in contact...

22:24.718 --> 22:28.220
...with the gunmen, but are releasing no
information regarding the identity of the men...

22:28.388 --> 22:30.765
...or the nature of the contact.

22:42.986 --> 22:46.030
But rather were
serving a week of academic detention.

22:59.419 --> 23:01.003
Don't worry.

23:10.305 --> 23:19.772
Fuck.

23:19.940 --> 23:23.109
Oh, fucking spectacular.

23:25.821 --> 23:27.071
How did you find me?

23:27.239 --> 23:29.156
I have a tracker on your phone.

23:31.952 --> 23:33.202
Come on!

24:14.870 --> 24:16.370
Car?

24:23.587 --> 24:25.212
- No!
- Enough of this bullshit, man.

24:25.380 --> 24:26.964
We've got to get the fuck out of here.

24:27.132 --> 24:29.008
Get the fuck out of my way.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.677
- Please.
- You don't need to look at this.

24:31.845 --> 24:36.098
You don't need... Fuck!
Just don't fuck with me. Don't look.

24:36.266 --> 24:37.850
Please.

24:38.018 --> 24:39.685
No, please.

24:39.853 --> 24:42.229
Please don't.
They'll give you what you want.

24:42.397 --> 24:45.232
- I know they will.
- So will you.

24:46.776 --> 24:49.862
You bastard! Goddamn it, stop!

24:51.490 --> 24:55.534
Don't. Don't!

25:04.794 --> 25:07.505
- Yeah?
- Car's here for you now.

25:07.672 --> 25:09.548
I'll call you back.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.848
Come on. We'll pick this up later.

25:38.537 --> 25:41.372
Hey, hey. I've been trying...
Hey, hey, hey! Listen to me. Listen to me.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.791
- Deva's in there? Okay.
- They're doing everything they can.

25:46.878 --> 25:49.004
- Yeah?
- Listen up.

25:49.172 --> 25:51.507
No, you listen.

25:51.675 --> 25:54.927
You're Lance Mangan. I remember you.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.930
Who the fuck are you?

25:58.473 --> 26:01.183
Brock Lotus.
I was a year behind you in school.

26:01.351 --> 26:03.227
Yeah, well, I don't remember you.

26:03.395 --> 26:06.272
Well, I remember you were all-state.

26:06.439 --> 26:09.858
You started at point guard.
You called smart plays.

26:10.026 --> 26:11.944
See if you can call a smart play now.

26:12.112 --> 26:13.696
All right? Your car is here.

26:13.863 --> 26:17.157
You want it moved up there by the door,
I'm gonna need something from you.

26:17.325 --> 26:19.868
Let's get the kids out of there.

26:22.163 --> 26:23.664
I'll send out four kids.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.709
Then you move the car to the door.

26:26.876 --> 26:29.628
All right, it's a deal.

26:32.173 --> 26:34.300
You four in the front, you're leaving.

26:34.467 --> 26:36.719
One, two, three, four. Get up.

26:36.886 --> 26:38.929
- Nathan, bring them to the door.
- Let's go. Come on.

26:39.097 --> 26:42.224
- I said four. Future Horse stays right here.
- Whoa, whoa.

26:42.392 --> 26:45.603
She's coming with me.
I'm not leaving without her.

26:45.770 --> 26:47.730
It's okay, Beaty, go.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.610
- What the fuck? Get over here.
- Run!

26:52.777 --> 26:55.237
Get back here! Get back down!

26:55.405 --> 26:56.780
- Watch them!
- Sit down!

26:56.948 --> 26:58.324
- No!
- Get over there, teacher.

27:01.411 --> 27:02.828
Well, especially if they cover this...

27:02.996 --> 27:05.164
Brock, can you please give us an update?

27:05.332 --> 27:07.458
I'd like one too.

27:12.255 --> 27:14.131
What's going on? You going in?

27:14.299 --> 27:16.884
No. I just negotiated
the release of four of the kids.

27:17.052 --> 27:18.886
Great. Where are they?

27:20.805 --> 27:22.222
Um...

27:23.516 --> 27:26.602
- These men are willing to kill.
- You go in there guns blazing...

27:26.770 --> 27:28.604
...you're gonna have a handful
of dead children.

27:28.772 --> 27:30.272
Who said anything about guns blazing?

27:30.440 --> 27:31.982
You can't walk in there... Aah!

27:32.817 --> 27:34.652
Don't touch me.

27:37.280 --> 27:38.989
We follow him in, right?

27:39.157 --> 27:41.241
I'm not following him anywhere.
He's insane.

27:41.409 --> 27:44.620
We stay to protocol. We wait out here.

27:52.003 --> 27:53.420
What the fuck?

27:54.839 --> 27:56.423
I'm unarmed.

27:56.591 --> 27:58.550
Don't fucking move!

28:01.638 --> 28:04.139
I came in here to help you work this out.

28:04.307 --> 28:05.891
Fuck you.

28:06.059 --> 28:07.643
You're in some
deep shit here, man.

28:07.811 --> 28:10.062
Lance, get back here!

28:11.606 --> 28:13.357
Where's Lance?

28:15.068 --> 28:16.485
Huh?

28:30.417 --> 28:31.875
Future Horse.

28:47.016 --> 28:49.518
You're not gonna walk out of this.

28:49.686 --> 28:50.894
They won't let you go.

28:51.062 --> 28:53.439
They have to. We have hostages.

28:53.606 --> 28:54.940
That doesn't matter anymore.

28:55.108 --> 28:56.734
That's gone. You killed a man.

28:56.901 --> 28:58.902
I didn't kill anyone!

28:59.070 --> 29:02.698
- It was fucking Lance.
- I believe you.

29:03.116 --> 29:05.492
Lance killed him. What's your name?

29:05.660 --> 29:07.202
You don't need to know my fucking name.

29:07.370 --> 29:08.912
- It's Nathan.
- Shut the fuck up!

29:09.080 --> 29:10.748
- Hey, hey, hey, Nathan.
- Back the fuck up.

29:10.915 --> 29:12.249
- I can help you.
- Lance!

29:12.417 --> 29:15.252
Get the fuck back here! Back up!

29:15.420 --> 29:17.921
Lance can't help you. I can.

29:21.217 --> 29:22.551
Oh, my God! Come on!

29:22.719 --> 29:24.386
Hey!

29:26.806 --> 29:28.557
Don't fucking move.

29:29.309 --> 29:33.103
I will fucking kill you.

29:36.232 --> 29:37.858
- I don't think so.
- Yes, I will.

29:38.026 --> 29:39.318
- No, not you.
- Yes, I will.

29:39.486 --> 29:41.862
- Not you, man.
- I will fucking kill you.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.537
You're no killer, Nathan.

29:50.705 --> 29:52.122
Yes, I am.

29:53.166 --> 29:55.501
- It's Lance.
- No.

29:55.668 --> 29:57.377
Lance, he's the killer.

29:57.545 --> 30:00.798
No, I am a fucking killer.

30:04.844 --> 30:07.221
Shots fired. We're going in!

30:07.388 --> 30:09.515
All of you up. Out, now.

30:13.144 --> 30:15.145
- Hold your fire!
- It's the students.

30:15.313 --> 30:18.148
- Get clear!
- Stay down. Come on. Come on.

30:24.614 --> 30:26.281
- Where's Deva?
- I don't know.

30:26.449 --> 30:29.159
- Where's my daughter?
- She's inside.

30:29.327 --> 30:30.702
Go forward!

30:34.374 --> 30:35.749
Jamie.

30:36.876 --> 30:37.960
It's okay.

30:39.128 --> 30:40.796
Let's... Let's go home, okay?

31:00.358 --> 31:02.359
Get up, Future Horse.

31:02.527 --> 31:05.571
Aah! Nathan, I got them. Nathan.

31:08.408 --> 31:11.285
Nathan. Oh, no, no, no.

31:13.204 --> 31:14.621
No!

31:16.916 --> 31:18.625
Oh, fuck.

31:19.669 --> 31:21.712
- Aah!
- Let her go, Lance.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.590
- Drop your fucking gun.
- Not gonna happen.

31:24.757 --> 31:26.174
Stand down, sheriff.

31:26.342 --> 31:28.677
- I'll fucking kill her!
- Let the girl go.

31:28.845 --> 31:30.762
I'll fucking blow her head off!

31:30.930 --> 31:33.265
- Drop that fucking gun now.
- Drop your weapon!

31:33.433 --> 31:35.225
Get down the fucking stairs right now!

31:35.393 --> 31:37.352
- Drop your weapon.
- Drop your fucking guns!

31:37.520 --> 31:39.938
- Get away! Get back!
- Stand down.

31:40.106 --> 31:42.399
Drop your gun! Drop it!

31:42.567 --> 31:44.067
Put it on the ground now!

32:15.058 --> 32:17.142
Sheriff. Are you injured?

32:17.310 --> 32:19.394
Uh, no.

32:19.562 --> 32:22.314
Good, then you can tell me...

32:30.073 --> 32:31.448
I did what I had to do.

32:31.616 --> 32:35.577
You just endangered the lives
of eight innocent people.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.374
Listen...

32:40.541 --> 32:42.709
...I'll give you everything you need...

32:42.877 --> 32:45.921
...I promise, in my report.

32:50.259 --> 32:52.052
Welcome to my world.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.618
Hey.

33:21.249 --> 33:23.667
Alma told me I'd find you here.

33:26.921 --> 33:31.216
That guy, the cashier,
he just woke up today and went to work.

33:31.884 --> 33:34.344
He really had no idea that...

33:34.512 --> 33:38.056
Hey, you are an excellent cop
and an excellent man.

33:38.224 --> 33:41.309
If there was something you could have done,
you would have done it.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.109
I'm pregnant.

34:00.747 --> 34:02.956
Police have confirmed that the two gunmen...

34:03.124 --> 34:05.834
...were both killed inside the school,
that the location is secure...

34:06.002 --> 34:08.295
...and that all eight of the former hostages
are alive...

34:08.463 --> 34:10.464
...and being attended by medical professionals.

34:10.631 --> 34:12.549
The gunmen were involved
in a botched robbery...

34:12.717 --> 34:14.051
...at a drugstore earlier today.

34:14.218 --> 34:17.679
A local police deputy intervened
and pursued them here to the high school...

34:17.847 --> 34:20.182
...at which point the gunmen
took eight hostages.

34:27.982 --> 34:31.526
So now you want to tell me
who the hell put the cuffs on you?

34:33.946 --> 34:35.614
Long story.

34:35.782 --> 34:38.366
- Sugar.
- Kai.

34:38.534 --> 34:39.993
Sheriff.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.496
I thought I'd find you here.

34:43.206 --> 34:44.664
Still patching yourself up, I see.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.000
I'll survive.

34:47.835 --> 34:51.004
You did good work today, sheriff.
This town owes you a real debt.

34:55.009 --> 34:57.302
It seems I'm in your debt as well.

34:57.762 --> 35:00.222
The DA formally dropped all charges today.

35:00.389 --> 35:02.474
Apparently the key piece of evidence
disappeared.

35:02.642 --> 35:05.393
Hmm, and a key witness.

35:05.937 --> 35:07.729
This is the first I've heard about that.

35:12.652 --> 35:14.861
Well, congratulations.

35:15.029 --> 35:16.822
You're a free man.

35:21.452 --> 35:24.329
You know, generally,
Banshee is a pretty quiet town.

35:24.497 --> 35:27.999
But after you arrived,
it's been one thing after another.

35:28.584 --> 35:32.003
It's almost as if you brought it all with you.

35:32.171 --> 35:35.257
"And behold a pale rider...

35:35.424 --> 35:37.968
...and his name that sat upon him
was Death.

35:38.136 --> 35:41.012
And hell followed with him."

35:41.597 --> 35:43.014
Revelations 6:8.

35:43.182 --> 35:46.810
Yeah, I've never had much patience
for people who quote scripture.

35:46.978 --> 35:49.896
This is God's country.
You'd better acquire the taste for it.

35:50.940 --> 35:52.858
You have a good night, Sugar.

35:53.025 --> 35:55.944
- Sheriff.
- You too, Kai.

36:03.703 --> 36:06.079
Are you ever gonna tell me that story?

36:08.166 --> 36:10.584
Come on, you and Proctor.

36:11.419 --> 36:14.337
What would we be without our secrets?

36:58.716 --> 37:00.717
Are you gonna shoot me?

37:12.939 --> 37:14.606
I'm sorry.

37:37.380 --> 37:41.091
I'm so, so sorry.

37:52.061 --> 37:53.478
Shh.

41:09.550 --> 41:11.217
Made them all myself.

41:11.385 --> 41:13.511
Strawberry, pecan...

41:13.679 --> 41:15.597
...and this one's called triple chocolate.

41:16.932 --> 41:18.433
The dark one.

41:22.104 --> 41:25.106
You're not from around here,
I can tell you that much.

41:25.649 --> 41:28.026
Everyone passes through here
at some point.

41:30.654 --> 41:32.822
And I would have remembered you.

41:34.116 --> 41:37.619
So that accent, where are you from?

41:39.580 --> 41:42.248
I'd rather talk about where I am.
