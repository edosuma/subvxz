00:13.250 --> 00:15.250
<i>Welcome back to </i>Smelt Tank.

00:19.375 --> 00:20.916
<i>Now entering the Smelt Tank,</i>

00:21.000 --> 00:24.541
<i>local entrepreneurs Diane Dunbrowski</i>
<i>and Gideon Duchamp,</i>

00:24.625 --> 00:28.416
<i>who are looking to smooth things out</i>
<i>with their lotion business, Congeal.</i>

00:28.500 --> 00:30.958
Gideon, relax,
you look like you're gonna faint.

00:31.041 --> 00:32.875
-I'm fine, just go.
-Um…

00:32.958 --> 00:37.041
Welcome to frickin' gorgeous city,
population you three.

00:38.875 --> 00:41.791
If you woulda told me that one day
I'd be pitching to the Smelts,

00:41.875 --> 00:44.791
I would've told you to stop mixing
your Ambien with White Claw.

00:45.833 --> 00:47.208
Move on.

00:47.291 --> 00:49.083
Anywho's the Boss…

00:49.166 --> 00:51.625
Cream team, hit them with the samples.

00:52.500 --> 00:54.666
Now, I ain't great
at all the business talk,

00:54.750 --> 00:56.000
so I'm gonna pass it over

00:56.083 --> 00:58.791
-to my little ticklish friend, Gideon.

00:58.875 --> 01:00.250
Okay. All right.

01:01.083 --> 01:04.291
Smelts, we have a state-of-the-art
production facility,

01:04.375 --> 01:06.958
a direct supply line
to our main ingredients,

01:07.041 --> 01:09.791
and a product
that people are raving about.

01:09.875 --> 01:12.875
We are perfectly teed up
to take this to the next level.

01:12.958 --> 01:17.208
What we need is access to major buyers
who can help us get there.

01:17.291 --> 01:18.583
So, whaddya say?

01:18.666 --> 01:22.041
We dealt it. Do you wanna smelt it?

01:23.875 --> 01:25.333
I think this stuff feels great,

01:25.416 --> 01:27.583
but I don't know the cosmetics field.

01:27.666 --> 01:31.791
My business is pizza, some salads,
obviously pop.

01:31.875 --> 01:33.125
Anyway, I'm out.

01:34.625 --> 01:36.125
Yeah, I'll piggyback on that.

01:36.208 --> 01:38.583
My business is mostly sub-oriented.

01:38.666 --> 01:41.083
-Do they only pick food ideas?
-Subs, chips…

01:41.166 --> 01:42.000
It is Chicago.

01:42.708 --> 01:44.416
So unfortunately, I'm out.

01:44.500 --> 01:45.625
Mm…

01:47.041 --> 01:48.750
And then there was one.

01:48.833 --> 01:50.500
Look, I'm a pasta girl.

01:50.583 --> 01:53.916
-I have a whole line of sauces, noodles.
-Come on, Rancic, you too?

01:54.000 --> 01:57.875
But I also have a cosmetics line,
so I know my lotion.

01:57.958 --> 02:00.416
And you two are quite the combination.

02:00.500 --> 02:04.916
This firecracker sets 'em up
and this handsome hunk knocks 'em down.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.333
Next week is Cosmecon,

02:06.416 --> 02:08.625
the biggest cosmetics convention
in the Midwest.

02:08.708 --> 02:10.000
Where's she going with this?

02:10.083 --> 02:13.166
And I could guarantee you a booth
at the convention

02:13.250 --> 02:15.333
and a slot on the big stage

02:15.416 --> 02:19.000
to showcase your product
in front of thousands of people.

02:19.083 --> 02:21.625
-Congeal…
-Ah shit, she's out.

02:21.708 --> 02:23.041
…you have a deal!

02:24.583 --> 02:26.375
-Yeah, we did it!
-We did it!

02:26.458 --> 02:27.375
Aah!

02:27.458 --> 02:28.458
Oh my God!

02:28.541 --> 02:31.541
-I'll give him mouth-to-mouth.
-No! I'm fine! I'm fine!

02:43.875 --> 02:46.458
Stop churning, Mikey, it's not butter.
Go clockwise.

02:46.541 --> 02:48.333
-Aah…
-Make a circle.

02:48.416 --> 02:50.125
Oh! Ten-four!

02:51.791 --> 02:53.333
How's our bottle count, ladies?

02:53.416 --> 02:56.625
Like my breasts before children.
Very high.

02:56.708 --> 02:57.708
Fantastic!

02:57.791 --> 02:59.083
Hold up-- You have kids?

02:59.166 --> 03:02.166
And no one's getting that recipe
without going through me!

03:02.250 --> 03:04.458
Again, we don't need you to guard it.

03:04.541 --> 03:05.750
Who wants rib tips?

03:05.833 --> 03:07.916
-Oh, oh, oh!
-I do! Smells good!

03:08.000 --> 03:08.875
Mwah.

03:08.958 --> 03:11.333
New mock-up
for the logo looks great, Daniel.

03:11.416 --> 03:15.625
Thanks! Diane gave it "two farts up,"
but I didn't know if that was good or bad.

03:15.708 --> 03:18.083
Speaking of, where is she?

03:18.166 --> 03:19.791
We have an important announcement to make.

03:23.958 --> 03:27.916
Sorry, gang! Barack's in town
and traffic's a nightmare.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.333
Thanks, Obama.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.083
Anyhoo, did I miss it?

03:32.166 --> 03:34.125
Did you tell Daniel we made him a partner?

03:34.208 --> 03:35.208
What?!

03:35.291 --> 03:38.666
I was waiting to do it together,
like we planned.

03:38.750 --> 03:43.125
Daniel, we have decided
to officially name you Artistic Director

03:43.208 --> 03:46.291
<i>and</i> give you 10% of the company.

03:46.375 --> 03:48.041
Oh my God! Uh!

03:48.125 --> 03:50.791
What should I say?
I'm not great off the cuff.

03:50.875 --> 03:53.958
You don't have to say anything,
it's just an announcement.

03:54.041 --> 03:55.416
Right. Sorry, boss.

03:55.500 --> 03:56.541
I'm not your boss.

03:56.625 --> 03:58.541
And again, stop saluting people.

03:58.625 --> 04:00.541
-Mm?
-Diane, can we talk?

04:00.625 --> 04:01.875
Absotootly!

04:01.958 --> 04:04.583
Gimme two secs, though.
I'm smelling rib tips.

04:04.666 --> 04:09.875
Diane, Cosmecon is this weekend
and I need you showing up on time!

04:09.958 --> 04:11.333
-Copy that, partner.

04:11.416 --> 04:13.125
Oh my God, Diane! Check your email!

04:13.208 --> 04:16.083
-Why? You check it for the both of us.

04:16.166 --> 04:19.125
Girl, Borough just sent us an offer
to buy us out!

04:19.208 --> 04:21.416
Holy shit! Gideon, we're rich!

04:21.500 --> 04:24.083
I can get new tits, new teeth, new ass.

04:24.166 --> 04:25.166
Mm. What else?

04:25.250 --> 04:27.583
We are not taking this deal.

04:27.666 --> 04:29.333
Say that again in my good ear.

04:29.416 --> 04:30.625
Oh! New ears!

04:30.708 --> 04:32.875
This offer is small potatoes.

04:32.958 --> 04:35.458
With the exposure
we're about to get at Cosmecon,

04:35.541 --> 04:39.125
we have a chance at landing a deal
ten times this amount.

04:39.208 --> 04:41.208
It's time to think big, girl!

04:41.291 --> 04:43.041
I always do.

04:43.125 --> 04:44.541
Please, don't say it.

04:44.625 --> 04:46.625
I'm talkin' 'bout cock, my friend.

04:47.750 --> 04:49.750
Diane, girl, you is nasty.

04:49.833 --> 04:51.958
And your shirt is covered in rib sauce.

04:52.041 --> 04:55.208
Joke's on you.
That's marinara from last week.

04:55.291 --> 04:56.583
Mm!

04:56.666 --> 05:00.791
Honey, have I told you lately
how much I love my new job?

05:00.875 --> 05:02.083
Oh, hey, hon.

05:02.166 --> 05:03.208
What's with the lights?

05:03.291 --> 05:05.333
And is the air off? It is boiling in here.

05:05.416 --> 05:06.375
I didn't notice.

05:06.458 --> 05:09.083
You're drenched in sweat.
What is going on?

05:09.166 --> 05:11.541
Honestly, Bon,
our new incomes aren't cutting it.

05:11.625 --> 05:14.000
After the cost of gas, cleaning,
and fender benders,

05:14.083 --> 05:15.250
I'm barely breaking even.

05:15.333 --> 05:16.291
Eh… Oh!

05:16.375 --> 05:18.083
We could have a yard sale.

05:18.166 --> 05:19.333
"A yard sale"?

05:19.416 --> 05:22.875
Our lawn is Kentucky bluegrass,
it can't handle all that foot traffic.

05:22.958 --> 05:24.583
We need real money.

05:24.666 --> 05:26.750
We need to seriously talk
about offloading--

05:26.833 --> 05:28.500
Don't say offloading assets.

05:28.583 --> 05:29.666
That's a last resort.

05:29.750 --> 05:31.041
Let's double down.

05:31.125 --> 05:34.250
I'll take every event
the London Brothers have.

05:34.333 --> 05:38.208
I'm already driving eight hours a day,
but I guess I could go to 12.

05:38.291 --> 05:39.125
Mm.

05:39.208 --> 05:40.291
Or 16.

05:40.375 --> 05:43.291
That's the spirit! We can do this, Mark!

05:47.291 --> 05:48.708
Enjoy your Bamboo Blaster.

05:48.791 --> 05:50.666
I threw in some extra crickets.

05:51.791 --> 05:53.583
Danny-bananny. Ha-ha!

05:53.666 --> 05:55.708
So, I'm having a party.

05:55.791 --> 05:58.208
It's nothing big, just some good friends.

05:58.291 --> 06:01.083
Feather, wow! That's really nice of you.

06:01.166 --> 06:04.458
See, we don't just work together,
we're friends.

06:04.541 --> 06:05.666
Oh. No. Um…

06:05.750 --> 06:08.833
I meant, I need you to close up
the store for me Friday night.

06:08.916 --> 06:13.333
Friday? Oh.
I actually can't. I have Cosmecon.

06:13.416 --> 06:18.541
I'm sorry, Taurus must be rising
because I'm not communicating well today.

06:18.625 --> 06:20.208
I wasn't asking.

06:20.291 --> 06:22.916
Hate to play the boss card,
but I need you.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.916
Oh my God. I just realized,
I have a boss card now.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.208
No, uh…

06:28.291 --> 06:30.541
I was miming playing my boss card.

06:30.625 --> 06:32.541
You can't then use it back on me.

06:32.625 --> 06:35.666
Feather, I mean this
in the nicest way possible.

06:35.750 --> 06:37.000
I quit.

06:37.083 --> 06:38.250
I mean, goodbye.

06:38.333 --> 06:39.166
Mm.

06:43.125 --> 06:44.708
Good, you're home early!

06:44.791 --> 06:48.291
Now that we finally struck it rich,
I'm finally putting in the hot tub!

06:48.375 --> 06:49.541
That's a bad idea.

06:49.625 --> 06:52.458
Also, I'm home early
because I quit my job!

06:52.541 --> 06:53.750
Fuck yeah!

06:53.833 --> 06:56.666
Right? It's time to spread my wings!

06:56.750 --> 07:01.166
I mean, how pathetic is it that my life
has been just work and this apartment?

07:01.250 --> 07:04.666
Yeah! Now your life's
gonna be only this apartment.

07:04.750 --> 07:05.875
Oh, that's not what I meant.

07:05.958 --> 07:09.625
My friend, we're about to go
from Hagar Van Halen, which rocks,

07:09.708 --> 07:12.833
to David Lee Roth Van Halen,
which double rocks!

07:12.916 --> 07:14.958
Yes, that's a lot of rocking.

07:15.041 --> 07:18.000
Now, spread those wings
and grab that miter saw.

07:18.083 --> 07:20.708
This tub's going in-ground.

07:23.583 --> 07:25.166
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me!

07:25.875 --> 07:28.791
Excuse me, how much did you pay
for those laserdiscs?

07:28.875 --> 07:29.875
Eight bucks.

07:29.958 --> 07:31.958
For <i>Junior</i> and <i>Twins?</i>

07:32.041 --> 07:34.333
Congratulations! Deal of the century!

07:34.416 --> 07:36.500
You have them on DVD and Blu-ray.

07:36.583 --> 07:38.166
I thought we said no yard sale.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.583
We were gonna double down
on our jobs, remember?

07:40.666 --> 07:42.125
I just pulled an 18-hour shift!

07:42.208 --> 07:43.875
I got three flat tires!

07:43.958 --> 07:45.208
I am doubling down!

07:45.291 --> 07:49.250
I have a gig at the Cosmecon tomorrow.
I'm trying to make this work.

07:49.333 --> 07:50.458
Hey, how much for this?

07:50.541 --> 07:53.833
We are not gonna be able
to pay our mortgage selling our Slap Chop!

07:53.916 --> 07:55.791
-Hmm.
-We need to put the condo on the market.

07:55.875 --> 07:58.250
Fine. I will see Diane tomorrow
at Cosmecon

07:58.333 --> 08:01.958
and I will tell her in person
that we're broke and we have to evict her.

08:02.041 --> 08:04.625
-Okay, Mark?
-Sorry, how much for this?

08:04.708 --> 08:06.125
Oh my God, just take it!

08:06.208 --> 08:08.250
Yard sale is over!

08:10.208 --> 08:11.625
Great! Four for four!

08:12.875 --> 08:14.375
Without further ado,

08:14.458 --> 08:17.375
I'll hand the floor over
to my amazing partner,

08:17.458 --> 08:19.916
Gideon Duchamp-champ-champ…

08:20.000 --> 08:21.416
Good rehearsal, Diane.

08:21.500 --> 08:25.166
And obviously, on the day,
you won't be doing the Pac-Man thing.

08:25.250 --> 08:27.500
Ms. Pac-Man. Sexist.

08:27.583 --> 08:30.750
Tomorrow, we bring our A-game.
Get a good night of rest.

08:30.833 --> 08:32.166
Gonna sleep like a baby.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.833
I got earplugs for Fucks Loud Sophie.

08:34.916 --> 08:36.625
Well, if this weekend goes well,

08:36.708 --> 08:39.250
you won't have to deal
with this sad shack anymore.

08:39.333 --> 08:42.291
Ha! Yeah, right!
I'm never leaving this place.

08:42.375 --> 08:44.375
I've already broken ground on the hot tub.

08:44.458 --> 08:47.000
Your life is about to change, bish.

08:47.083 --> 08:50.708
Get ready for a whole new Diane! 'Night.

08:51.791 --> 08:53.750
What's wrong with the old Diane?

08:53.833 --> 08:56.708
-Hmm.

08:59.333 --> 09:02.291
I didn't know there was
this many types of cosmetics.

09:02.375 --> 09:05.416
All I use is a chunk of Dial soap
and a bar rag.

09:05.500 --> 09:08.083
Don't get distracted
by all those no-names.

09:08.166 --> 09:11.875
Focus on the heavies.
There's L'Oréal, Costco, CVS--

09:11.958 --> 09:15.625
-An open bar!
-Diane, no! Professional, remember?

09:15.708 --> 09:18.791
Yeah, yeah. No booze,
no cooze, no weed, no speed.

09:18.875 --> 09:21.250
-No coke, no crack, no smack, no jack--
-We get it.

09:21.333 --> 09:24.125
Here are your passes
and your hotel room keys.

09:24.208 --> 09:26.708
Comped rooms? Hell yeah!

09:26.791 --> 09:28.541
Bidet all day, baby!

09:28.625 --> 09:32.625
And Daniel, they've asked you
to speak on the Artistic Directors' panel

09:32.708 --> 09:33.708
in half an hour.

09:33.791 --> 09:34.958
I'm <i>on</i> the panel?

09:35.041 --> 09:38.083
Like, I have to talk… in front of people?

09:38.166 --> 09:40.041
Hell yeah, Danny Boy!

09:40.125 --> 09:41.458
Okay, I can do this.

09:41.541 --> 09:46.125
Just gonna google if there's a TED talk
about how to give a talk, I guess.

09:46.625 --> 09:48.666
Be cool. Costco, one o'clock.

09:48.750 --> 09:52.125
We're going to Costco at 1:00?
I gotta borrow Zuzana's card.

09:52.208 --> 09:53.708
You must be Diane and Gideon.

09:53.791 --> 09:56.708
A lot of buzz about Congeal
amongst the big-box stores.

09:57.708 --> 10:00.458
-"Big box--"
-Uh, thank you for stopping by.

10:00.541 --> 10:02.875
I hope you can
make the presentation tomorrow.

10:02.958 --> 10:05.625
Absolutely.
Then, I have to take off right away.

10:05.708 --> 10:08.250
-You know the life of an executive.
-Sure do!

10:08.333 --> 10:10.500
Mo money, mo hot tub problems.

10:10.583 --> 10:12.666
No, I just meant all the travel.

10:12.750 --> 10:15.416
Anyway, I am looking forward to <i>mañana</i>.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.458
We can't be doing all that traveling.

10:17.541 --> 10:20.375
Zuzana said she won't cover
any more of my shifts.

10:20.458 --> 10:22.208
Sugar, when we make this sale,

10:22.291 --> 10:24.791
you are not gonna be
working at Borough anymore.

10:24.875 --> 10:27.375
We're gonna be worldwide, baby!

10:27.458 --> 10:28.833
-Mm.

10:28.916 --> 10:30.250
Mm?

10:30.333 --> 10:31.250
Mm.

10:31.333 --> 10:32.916
You're not the boss of me.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.833
Mm. Mm.

10:34.916 --> 10:36.541
Hi, I'm Bonnie. I'm here for the--

10:36.625 --> 10:37.833
Great, the model is here.

10:37.916 --> 10:39.791
Model? Wow.

10:39.875 --> 10:43.750
Well, I was crowned
Miss Teen I-55 in high school, so--

10:44.833 --> 10:45.833
Uh…

10:45.916 --> 10:48.208
Is someone going to do my makeup?

10:48.291 --> 10:50.416
"Before" models do their own faces.

10:51.666 --> 10:54.375
-No! That's for "after" models only.
-Ow!

10:55.875 --> 10:59.500
Because we think
the real product is people.

10:59.583 --> 11:00.833
Does that make sense?

11:00.916 --> 11:03.166
So well said, Caden.

11:03.250 --> 11:06.041
Now, let's turn to a new brand, Congeal,

11:06.125 --> 11:09.208
and their own 18-year-old
Daniel Whiddington.

11:09.291 --> 11:10.333
Present!

11:10.416 --> 11:11.416
Yikes!

11:11.500 --> 11:16.333
So, Daniel, you bypassed college
and got into cosmetics with your aunt

11:16.416 --> 11:19.625
who called this a, quote,
"rags to bitches" story.

11:19.708 --> 11:24.041
So, how does that <i>laissez faire </i>approach
affect your back-end numbers?

11:24.125 --> 11:26.125
Ha-ha. "Back end."

11:26.208 --> 11:28.833
-Sorry. Um… I mean--

11:28.916 --> 11:30.333
Sorry! I'm sorry.

11:30.416 --> 11:31.416
Where was I?

11:31.500 --> 11:32.416
Um…

11:32.500 --> 11:33.750
So, sales…

11:33.833 --> 11:34.708
Ah!

11:34.791 --> 11:36.208
What are sales?

11:37.250 --> 11:38.625
I think that's great.

11:38.708 --> 11:40.083
What <i>are</i> sales?

11:40.166 --> 11:41.291
They're nothing.

11:41.375 --> 11:43.916
What are people? Everything!

11:44.000 --> 11:45.916
-Does that make sense?

11:46.000 --> 11:48.041
And our churn rate went bananas,

11:48.125 --> 11:50.666
once I implemented
evergreen marketing at Target.

11:50.750 --> 11:53.625
Yeah, I like to go into Target
and wear a red polo shirt

11:53.708 --> 11:56.708
so it looks like I work there,
and then fuck with everyone.

11:56.791 --> 11:57.625
Ugh!

11:57.708 --> 12:00.625
Can I get a glass of chardonnay
with a pinot grigio topper?

12:01.125 --> 12:03.208
-Bonnie? What are you doing here?
-Uh!

12:03.291 --> 12:06.041
Oh! Are you planning
one of your big, fancy events?

12:06.125 --> 12:09.750
Eh… Yes. I am helping coordinate all the--

12:09.833 --> 12:11.500
Hey, those thin lips are on in two.

12:11.583 --> 12:12.458
In a minute.

12:12.541 --> 12:14.458
Whoa, you have a whole staff?

12:14.541 --> 12:16.375
You're really killin' it, Bon.

12:16.458 --> 12:18.875
Look at us, couple of Chicago slobs,

12:18.958 --> 12:22.625
lathering ourselves up
with all these frou-frou beauty types.

12:22.708 --> 12:26.583
Congeal, the Dallas market
is super excited about you!

12:26.666 --> 12:27.791
Yeah, we'll see.

12:27.875 --> 12:30.625
Wow. It's really happening
for you, isn't it?

12:30.708 --> 12:31.916
Big changes.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.166
Yeah, well, not really changes,

12:34.250 --> 12:36.750
more like improvements
that keep everything the same.

12:36.833 --> 12:38.583
I'm not going anywhere, Bon.

12:38.666 --> 12:39.666
Right.

12:39.750 --> 12:40.625
Uh…

12:40.708 --> 12:42.125
Diane, I need to tell you something.

12:42.208 --> 12:43.291
Hello, Bonnie.

12:43.375 --> 12:47.458
Diane, Windy City Alive wants an interview
with the both of us, now.

12:47.541 --> 12:49.375
So, pop an Altoid. Okay? Come on.

12:49.458 --> 12:52.375
-Sorry, Bon. We'll catch up later.

12:53.750 --> 12:56.125
But I'm proud of you! Proud of us!

12:56.833 --> 12:57.666
Hmm.

12:57.750 --> 12:59.500
Can I get a rosé on the side?

13:00.833 --> 13:04.416
We are here with Congeal,
the stars of this year's Cosmecon.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.958
Always great
to see a Chi-Town-born company!

13:07.041 --> 13:08.708
Well, Chicago may be where we began,

13:08.791 --> 13:10.750
<i>but it is not where we're gonna end.</i>

13:10.833 --> 13:13.208
<i>We're goin' global, baby. </i>

13:13.291 --> 13:15.375
<i>But we also want to stay local.</i>

13:15.458 --> 13:17.583
<i>Maybe in a couple years</i>
<i>expand to the 'burbs.</i>

13:17.666 --> 13:20.750
<i>Well, we're thinking a bit bigger</i>
<i>than just the 'burbs.</i>

13:20.833 --> 13:23.125
<i>Sure. Maybe we hit lower Wisconsin.</i>

13:23.208 --> 13:25.625
What she's trying to say is

13:25.708 --> 13:29.208
that Congeal transcends geography.

13:29.291 --> 13:31.500
Well, we need to "Beat It,"

13:31.583 --> 13:36.250
but I will say, I tried a sample
and I was one "Smooth Criminal."

13:36.833 --> 13:37.666
And cut.

13:37.750 --> 13:40.750
Lose the Michael Jackson thing.
I have to stop doing that.

13:40.833 --> 13:43.250
What was that?
We have to be on the same page.

13:43.333 --> 13:45.125
"Set 'em up, knock 'em down." Remember?

13:45.208 --> 13:47.750
May I remind you,
you're not my boss anymore?

13:47.833 --> 13:49.333
This is a partnership.

13:49.416 --> 13:51.958
Yeah, well, one of us
hasn't been doing their part.

13:52.041 --> 13:54.166
I mean, you don't even check your emails.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.291
I don't know how!

13:55.375 --> 13:58.250
And by the way,
you're obsessed with emails.

13:58.958 --> 14:02.500
Okay, look, just remember to behave
at the mixer tonight. Please?

14:02.583 --> 14:05.625
Relax, my whole life's a mixer.

14:05.708 --> 14:08.250
-Yeah, that's what I'm worried about.
-Mm.

14:08.333 --> 14:11.958
Is this product supposed
to make my lips numb?

14:13.208 --> 14:15.166
-Hello?
-Did you talk to your sister?

14:15.250 --> 14:17.458
Not yet, I haven't had the chance.

14:17.541 --> 14:19.458
-Can you speed up? She's crowning!

14:19.541 --> 14:22.416
Well, you'd better do it soon
because I can't do this much longer!

14:22.500 --> 14:24.583
I'll tell her tomorrow, okay?

14:24.666 --> 14:27.458
Okay, stop with the sexy voice!
Just take care of it!

14:27.541 --> 14:31.208
Oh, it's happening! I can tell
this is gonna be a violent birth!

14:31.291 --> 14:33.583
-Oh, good Jesus!

14:35.375 --> 14:36.875
Two Old Styles, please.

14:36.958 --> 14:38.333
We only have Stella Artois.

14:38.416 --> 14:41.708
Eh, <i>bonjour</i>, I don't speak French.

14:41.791 --> 14:43.250
-Ugh.
-I'll take two.

14:43.333 --> 14:44.666
Are you okay?

14:44.750 --> 14:48.166
Oh, I'm fine. Gideon's the one
who's all stressed out.

14:49.416 --> 14:52.458
Okay, maybe go one for one with water?

14:52.541 --> 14:54.375
Daniel, right? It's Caden.

14:54.458 --> 14:57.708
Yes! Oh my God. Thank you so much
for bailing me out up there.

14:57.791 --> 14:59.458
No worries, man.

14:59.541 --> 15:02.666
Hey, we're hanging out
over by the Evian facial mist tent.

15:02.750 --> 15:03.833
Do you wanna join us?

15:03.916 --> 15:08.041
Definitely! Would it be okay
if I go over there and network for a bit?

15:08.125 --> 15:10.250
Yeah, go and have some fun, honey.

15:12.375 --> 15:14.208
-Diane?

15:14.291 --> 15:17.208
Hey! This beer has alcohol in it!

15:17.708 --> 15:20.208
Ooh. Who's this hottie boom body?

15:20.291 --> 15:23.500
This is Duane Reade, the CEO of Walgreens.

15:23.583 --> 15:26.083
Oh! You guys got the best sushi!

15:26.166 --> 15:31.625
We were just discussing Walgreens' foray
into more artisanal cosmetics.

15:31.708 --> 15:34.666
-We love products that have a story.

15:34.750 --> 15:36.875
-The distribution curve for a small--
-Oh, no way!

15:36.958 --> 15:39.000
The song from <i>Dirty Dancing</i>!

15:39.083 --> 15:40.083
<i>Dirty Dancing?</i>

15:40.166 --> 15:42.541
-Come on, Duane, let's go!
-I--

15:42.625 --> 15:45.125
I don't think they want anyone
to dance, Diane!

15:45.208 --> 15:47.208
So, is this your first convention?

15:47.291 --> 15:51.166
Was it that obvious?
I felt so out of place up there.

15:51.250 --> 15:52.416
Hey, you did great!

15:52.500 --> 15:55.041
Besides, you don't want
to be like those people.

15:55.125 --> 15:58.083
I mean, 18 and already an entrepreneur?

15:58.166 --> 16:00.083
Mwah! Chef's kiss.

16:00.166 --> 16:03.458
But sometimes I kinda feel like
I missed out by not going to college.

16:03.541 --> 16:06.000
Oh, ew. You missed nothing.

16:06.083 --> 16:08.250
It was all, like, parties and drinking.

16:08.333 --> 16:10.125
Only thing I remember from college

16:10.208 --> 16:12.583
is coming home at 3:00 a.m.
and making out with her.

16:12.666 --> 16:14.125
And with him.

16:14.208 --> 16:16.583
We all made out so much.

16:16.666 --> 16:19.666
Ha, ha. Yeah, that sounds… lame.

16:21.250 --> 16:24.041
Uh, I don't remember
this part from the movie.

16:24.125 --> 16:25.833
What about this part?

16:25.916 --> 16:27.916
Not the lift. It's so dangerous!

16:28.000 --> 16:30.500
And it's from an entirely different movie!

16:30.583 --> 16:32.291
-No!

16:32.375 --> 16:33.250
-No, no, no!

16:34.250 --> 16:35.791
Oh, that was awful.

16:38.500 --> 16:41.083
Nobody puts Baby on the corner!

16:41.166 --> 16:42.125
Ow…

16:42.208 --> 16:45.541
That image of your vagina
will haunt me to my grave!

16:45.625 --> 16:47.750
Relax, you sound like my dentist.

16:47.833 --> 16:49.916
Diane, that was a disaster!

16:50.000 --> 16:51.958
You're lucky we still have
the Borough deal

16:52.041 --> 16:56.541
because at this rate, we're not gonna
have any options after the presentation!

16:56.625 --> 16:58.125
Oh, I passed on that.

16:58.208 --> 16:59.250
What?!

16:59.333 --> 17:03.875
You said to be a partner,
so I checked my email and did my part!

17:03.958 --> 17:07.000
You wet-brained fool!

17:07.083 --> 17:09.125
You said it was small potatoes!

17:09.208 --> 17:11.791
Yes, but they were
the only potatoes we had!

17:11.875 --> 17:14.458
Now, we have no potatoes!

17:14.541 --> 17:17.333
Okay, all this potato talk
has got me hungry.

17:17.416 --> 17:19.041
I'm gonna order some tots.

17:19.125 --> 17:24.250
You know, I would be fine
if the only life you ruined was your own,

17:24.333 --> 17:26.000
but that's never the case, is it?

17:26.083 --> 17:29.833
You have to bring down
everyone around you.

17:29.916 --> 17:33.416
Everybody. It's a sickness! You're sick!

17:33.500 --> 17:35.500
Hey! I don't need this bullshit!

17:35.583 --> 17:38.375
I was perfectly happy
until you took my product

17:38.458 --> 17:40.416
and tried to make it something it's not.

17:40.500 --> 17:42.541
I'm not gonna let you do the same to me!

17:42.625 --> 17:44.291
You best be headed to your room

17:44.375 --> 17:47.041
because that presentation tomorrow
is our last hope!

17:47.125 --> 17:50.750
And put on some goddamn underwear!

17:50.833 --> 17:53.333
Now, you sound like my eye doctor!

18:37.625 --> 18:40.208
Daniel! Where the hell is Diane?!

18:40.291 --> 18:42.541
I don't know. I thought
the plan was to meet here.

18:42.625 --> 18:44.541
No, I know the plan, I made the plan!

18:44.625 --> 18:46.750
Call her, she's not picking up for me.

18:46.833 --> 18:47.875
On it.

18:53.875 --> 18:54.958
You okay, lady?

18:55.041 --> 18:56.791
Ugh…

18:56.875 --> 18:58.583
Is this Heaven?

18:59.333 --> 19:00.958
Nope. It's Chicago.

19:01.041 --> 19:03.541
Holy cow! Barack Obama!

19:03.625 --> 19:05.416
Oh my God, I frickin' love you!

19:05.500 --> 19:07.750
I voted for you, like, six times!

19:07.833 --> 19:09.291
You're looking a little beat up.

19:09.375 --> 19:11.500
At first, I thought
you were a wet fur coat.

19:11.583 --> 19:14.250
Yeah, I had a rough night.

19:14.333 --> 19:16.041
I can see. You want to talk about it?

19:19.375 --> 19:20.666
Okay. She's not in her room.

19:20.750 --> 19:23.083
She's not at the omelette bar,
she's not at the waffle bar.

19:23.166 --> 19:24.375
She's not at the bar bar!

19:24.458 --> 19:27.833
Oh, sweet Lord Jesus,
this cannot be happening!

19:27.916 --> 19:31.083
I need her! She's the Penn to my Teller!

19:31.166 --> 19:32.833
Or maybe she's Teller, I don't know.

19:32.916 --> 19:34.708
Which one doesn't shut the fuck up?

19:34.791 --> 19:37.291
<i>We're gonna take a short break,</i>
<i>but up next is Congeal!</i>

19:37.375 --> 19:38.500
I'll check the bathroom!

19:38.583 --> 19:40.541
Women's and men's!

19:41.333 --> 19:42.166
Mm.

19:42.250 --> 19:44.750
Okay, Bonnie, prep any poses
that accentuate your cellulite.

19:44.833 --> 19:45.708
Uh…

19:45.791 --> 19:47.416
Yeah, that's perfect.

19:51.833 --> 19:52.666
Hello!

19:52.750 --> 19:54.958
Mark, I can't do this anymore.

19:55.041 --> 19:55.875
Me neither!

19:55.958 --> 19:59.583
Because my car was just stolen
by a group of teenagers

19:59.666 --> 20:01.000
in Muncie, Indiana!

20:01.083 --> 20:02.333
<i>What? Are you okay?</i>

20:02.416 --> 20:03.958
No, I am not!

20:04.958 --> 20:07.125
It's over. Put the condo on the market.

20:07.208 --> 20:08.708
Already did! I love you!

20:09.791 --> 20:11.458
Hey, cellulite, we're ready for you.

20:11.541 --> 20:13.416
Oh, fuck off. I quit!

20:16.250 --> 20:19.416
And then he tells me we're not
gonna be in Chicago anymore.

20:19.500 --> 20:22.250
I mean, who in their right mind
would leave this place?

20:22.333 --> 20:23.541
Well, I did.

20:23.625 --> 20:26.958
Yeah, but that's different.
You had to for your career.

20:27.041 --> 20:28.041
So…

20:28.125 --> 20:29.416
Oh!

20:29.500 --> 20:32.291
Okay, you walked me into that one.

20:32.375 --> 20:35.250
Diane, you just have to remember
that change is a part of life,

20:35.333 --> 20:38.250
and embracing that change
doesn't mean you're not being yourself.

20:38.333 --> 20:41.541
Whoa! I wish you could
give this presentation!

20:41.625 --> 20:44.083
Not happening. Speaking of which,
when does that start?

20:44.166 --> 20:45.375
Not until, like, 11:00.

20:45.458 --> 20:47.041
Well, it's 10:55.

20:47.125 --> 20:48.875
Ah, shit! I gotta go!

20:49.541 --> 20:51.625
Hey, is there any way I can get a ride?

20:51.708 --> 20:53.666
Yes. You. Can.

20:53.750 --> 20:55.250
Thanks, Obama.

20:55.333 --> 20:56.500
Shotgun!

20:56.583 --> 20:58.375
-Freeze!
-Get on the ground!

20:58.875 --> 21:04.041
When I saw these two on Smelt Tank,
I knew I had netted a winner.

21:04.125 --> 21:08.750
Chicago Cosmecon,
please welcome to the stage, Congeal!

21:08.833 --> 21:10.958
-Yes, alright!
-Woo-hoo!

21:12.291 --> 21:17.250
Hello! Who's ready to freakin' party
while… also moisturizing?

21:18.875 --> 21:19.875
Okay then.

21:19.958 --> 21:22.041
My name is Gideon Duchamp.

21:22.125 --> 21:23.958
Or as Pac-Man would say,

21:24.041 --> 21:27.083
Gideon Duchamp-champ-champ-champ.

21:29.291 --> 21:31.125
Actually, it was Ms. Pac-Man.

21:31.208 --> 21:32.583
Does that help the joke?

21:32.666 --> 21:34.625
-Come on.

21:36.416 --> 21:39.500
Don't faint, don't you fucking faint!

21:40.666 --> 21:42.958
Hello, Cosmecon!

21:43.041 --> 21:44.208
-Thank God!

21:44.291 --> 21:48.833
Who's ready to frickin' party
while moisturizing?

21:48.916 --> 21:51.208
Come on, everyone on your feet!

21:51.291 --> 21:53.541
-Ta-da-da-da!

21:53.625 --> 21:56.291
Talking to you, mustache. Ta-da-da-da!

21:56.375 --> 21:57.708
On your feet, glasses!

21:58.208 --> 22:00.250
Ta-da-da-da-da!

22:00.333 --> 22:01.833
Y'all ready for Congeal?

22:01.916 --> 22:04.000
That's what I'm talkin' about.

22:04.083 --> 22:05.750
-Okay, let's get real.

22:05.833 --> 22:09.375
I started making lotion as a way
to give gifts to the people I care about

22:09.458 --> 22:11.000
while also being super cheap.

22:11.083 --> 22:12.750
And while a lot has changed,

22:12.833 --> 22:16.791
one thing that hasn't is the love
that goes into this product.

22:16.875 --> 22:19.833
-And thanks to this sweet man right here…

22:19.916 --> 22:23.333
…who dreamed big
and pushed me out of my comfort zone,

22:23.416 --> 22:25.666
we have a killer business plan

22:25.750 --> 22:28.750
and both of us are ready
to take this to the next level.

22:28.833 --> 22:30.958
Gid, take it away, baby.

22:31.041 --> 22:32.375
Thank you, Diane.

22:32.458 --> 22:33.791
As my partner pointed out,

22:33.875 --> 22:37.041
our journey is just as impressive
as our product.

22:37.125 --> 22:38.666
Our projection is the future…

22:38.750 --> 22:42.208
-In conclusion, Congeal frickin' rocks!

22:42.291 --> 22:47.541
And we hope our presentation
has given you a big lift!

22:47.625 --> 22:51.083
Diane, no!
Not the lift from <i>Dirty Dancing </i>again!

22:51.166 --> 22:53.666
-I'm wearing underwear!

22:53.750 --> 22:55.208
This song is literally called

22:55.291 --> 22:57.708
"Flashdance," parentheses,
"What a Feeling."

22:58.541 --> 22:59.666
No--

22:59.750 --> 23:02.916
-Whoo-hoo!
-Whoa!

23:03.000 --> 23:06.041
JK, I'm not wearing underwear.

23:06.125 --> 23:08.750
Whoo! Diane, child, you is nasty!

23:08.833 --> 23:11.250
And I am here for it, honey!

23:15.708 --> 23:18.458
I gotta say, that was incredible!

23:18.541 --> 23:19.791
Really blew me away!

23:19.875 --> 23:21.500
Does this mean we have a deal?

23:21.583 --> 23:23.041
-Yeah, that's a no.
-What?

23:23.125 --> 23:25.291
-Why?
-It came down to numbers.

23:25.375 --> 23:28.583
It's not cost-effective
to have Congeal in a large retail space.

23:28.666 --> 23:31.958
But great job! You two nailed that lift!

23:33.208 --> 23:34.791
I'm so sorry, Gid.

23:34.875 --> 23:36.625
No, Diane, I'm sorry.

23:36.708 --> 23:41.000
The line between boss and bossy
can get really blurred sometimes.

23:41.083 --> 23:42.791
Should we do a sad hug?

23:42.875 --> 23:45.083
Oh, most definitely, bitch.

23:45.166 --> 23:46.208
Mm!

23:46.291 --> 23:48.291
Hey! Check your email!

23:48.375 --> 23:49.708
-Bird got my phone.

23:49.791 --> 23:50.708
It's from Borough!

23:50.791 --> 23:52.875
They said they appreciate
the hardball approach

23:52.958 --> 23:55.125
and they want to double their offer!

23:55.208 --> 23:59.291
Are you telling me we just sold
our company for a shit ton of money?

23:59.375 --> 24:00.916
You know what this means!

24:01.000 --> 24:03.041
Let's frickin' party!

24:03.125 --> 24:04.791
Hey, that's my line!

24:08.791 --> 24:10.791
I'm so happy for you, Miss Dunbrowski!

24:10.875 --> 24:14.750
Hey, you call me Diane. Or Mom.

24:14.833 --> 24:16.333
We're real proud of you, Ma.

24:16.416 --> 24:19.083
Thank you, guys. I love you all.

24:19.166 --> 24:20.416
Even you, Kurt.

24:20.500 --> 24:22.833
You never cease to amaze me, Di.

24:23.916 --> 24:25.625
My other family!

24:25.708 --> 24:29.375
I am gonna cut hair next to you three
until the day I fuckin' die.

24:29.458 --> 24:30.666
Which won't be for a while

24:30.750 --> 24:32.875
because now I can
afford fruits and vegetables.

24:32.958 --> 24:35.000
Appletinis don't count as fruit.

24:35.083 --> 24:36.416
But vodka is potato.

24:37.083 --> 24:38.750
Thank you, Carl. Phew!

24:38.833 --> 24:40.250
Thank God, we have a buyer.

24:40.333 --> 24:42.416
-He's emailing the paperwork now.

24:42.500 --> 24:44.750
Okay. I'm just gonna tell her.

24:47.750 --> 24:51.208
Well, if it isn't my favorite sister
and her first husband.

24:51.291 --> 24:54.541
-"First husband"?
-Diane, this is so amazing.

24:54.625 --> 24:56.125
And I am really proud of you.

24:56.208 --> 24:57.041
Aww.

24:57.125 --> 25:01.166
I know this is bad timing, but we had
to make a tough decision and…

25:02.166 --> 25:04.791
I'm so sorry,
but we need to sell the condo.

25:05.291 --> 25:06.666
You snakes!

25:06.750 --> 25:08.375
You're doing this to me again?!

25:08.458 --> 25:12.458
Diane, please. We would never do this
if there were any other options.

25:12.541 --> 25:14.458
How soon before I'm out on my ass?

25:14.541 --> 25:16.416
Well, we actually just got a buyer.

25:16.500 --> 25:18.250
Who is it? I want a name!

25:18.333 --> 25:21.666
Uh, it was sold to a… Tits McGee?

25:24.083 --> 25:27.583
It's me, you assholes! I bought the condo!

25:27.666 --> 25:28.750
Wait, what?

25:28.833 --> 25:32.833
The Borough deal was just enough for me
to pay you guys what you were asking.

25:32.916 --> 25:36.666
Wow! Well, congrats, homeowner!

25:36.750 --> 25:38.500
I have to tell you guys something.

25:38.583 --> 25:41.375
This gap year was the best decision
I ever made.

25:41.458 --> 25:43.875
Aunt Diane, I love living with you!

25:43.958 --> 25:45.250
Back at ya, kiddo.

25:45.333 --> 25:48.541
But I really need
to find some friends my own age.

25:48.625 --> 25:50.958
So, I'm going to college!

25:51.041 --> 25:53.625
Traitor! I made you, ya little shit!

25:53.708 --> 25:57.083
Relax, I'm going to DePaul,
it's 11 blocks away.

25:57.166 --> 25:58.416
I'm still living with you.

25:58.500 --> 26:00.416
Whoo-hoo!

26:00.500 --> 26:02.041
Did you hear, Mom and Dad?

26:02.125 --> 26:04.000
We're going back to college!

26:04.083 --> 26:06.166
Well, not "we," I am.

26:06.250 --> 26:08.291
And you guys can relax too.

26:08.375 --> 26:11.750
I'm using my money from the buyout
to cover my first year of tuition.

26:11.833 --> 26:14.291
Ah! Thank you! I can't be a Postmate.

26:14.375 --> 26:16.708
Even the smell of spicy food
gives me heartburn.

26:16.791 --> 26:18.250
Attention, everyone!

26:18.333 --> 26:20.916
I'd like to make a toast
to the Congeal team.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.041
We did it!

26:22.125 --> 26:24.250
-Congratulations, Congeal!

26:24.333 --> 26:26.250
Where are the other Bulls?

26:26.333 --> 26:29.041
And thanks to all of you for being you.

26:29.125 --> 26:32.791
Because you being you
is what makes me be me.

26:32.875 --> 26:35.041
Now, let's frickin' party!

26:40.916 --> 26:42.458
Okay, nobody panic!

26:42.541 --> 26:44.458
Everyone, grab a glow stick!

26:44.541 --> 26:46.666
-Already on it!
-Yay!

26:46.750 --> 26:48.541
That's what I'm talkin' about!

26:48.625 --> 26:51.666
The party never stops
when you're with Diane!

26:51.750 --> 26:54.250
All I'm sayin' is, prove me wrong.

26:54.333 --> 26:56.208
Tell me I'm wrong!
