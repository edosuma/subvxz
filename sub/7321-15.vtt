00:05.205 --> 00:08.038
<i>Every patient's story</i>
<i>starts the same way.</i>

00:09.376 --> 00:12.004
<i>It starts with them being fine.</i>

00:12.779 --> 00:15.179
<i>It starts in the "before."</i>

00:16.181 --> 00:19.743
<i>They cling to this moment,</i>
<i>this memory of being fine,</i>

00:19.819 --> 00:23.550
<i>this before, as though talking about it</i>
<i>may somehow bring it back.</i>

00:23.623 --> 00:25.591
- Long time.
- Naomi.

00:25.658 --> 00:27.922
We got an ICU bed
all ready for him.

00:27.961 --> 00:29.758
<i>But what they don't realize is that</i>

00:29.796 --> 00:32.924
<i>the fact that they're</i>
<i>talking about it to us,</i>

00:32.966 --> 00:34.763
<i>their doctors...</i>

00:34.801 --> 00:37.702
He was fine. We went to lunch...

00:37.737 --> 00:41.070
<i>...means there's no going back.</i>

00:41.141 --> 00:44.076
<i>By the time they see us,</i>

00:44.144 --> 00:46.271
<i>they're already in the "after."</i>

00:52.685 --> 00:54.380
What the hell are you doing?

00:54.421 --> 00:58.721
The interns are broken. They've been
punished for taking out their appendixes

00:58.758 --> 01:01.454
and it's making them hate medicine.
They're lost,

01:01.494 --> 01:05.224
and they've forgotten this thing they
hate is actually a thing they love,

01:05.265 --> 01:06.857
so I'm gonna remind them.

01:09.602 --> 01:13.299
Is this about Denny? Is this some
kind of dead boyfriend art therapy?

01:13.373 --> 01:16.069
This is not about Denny.
It's about the interns.

01:16.109 --> 01:18.771
- Who cares? They're losers...
- They're not!

01:18.812 --> 01:23.306
They're not. They're just... They need
to have a little fun. And so do I.

01:24.517 --> 01:26.610
Where are the damn scissors?

01:28.988 --> 01:31.047
They're right in front of you.

01:32.192 --> 01:33.386
Oh.

01:34.260 --> 01:36.660
- Right.
- Iz...

01:36.696 --> 01:39.324
Will you hand me that large bow, please?

01:42.368 --> 01:43.995
Great. Just put it down.

01:44.037 --> 01:46.801
See? It's gonna be great.

01:47.607 --> 01:51.805
- Does he know how he got the parasite?
- From eating unwashed fruit in Mexico.

01:51.845 --> 01:54.336
- He's bradycardic.
- And hypotensive?

01:54.380 --> 01:57.315
A reaction to the fentanyl drip.
Stop the drip, push Narcan...

01:57.383 --> 01:59.146
Wait! Derek, he was in status.

01:59.219 --> 02:02.416
If you take him off and he seizes,
there could be brain damage.

02:02.455 --> 02:04.616
- Better hope that doesn't happen.
- Hope?

02:04.657 --> 02:08.457
That's what your plan is hinging on?
Hoping the worst doesn't happen?

02:08.495 --> 02:11.692
I'm hoping he's stopped seizing.
If we don't reverse the drip,

02:11.764 --> 02:15.427
his heart is going to arrest.
So unless you have a better idea.

02:15.468 --> 02:16.662
Push the Narcan.

02:16.703 --> 02:20.002
<i>And while every patient's</i>
<i>story starts the same way,</i>

02:20.039 --> 02:21.973
<i>how the story ends...</i>

02:22.008 --> 02:26.377
<i>...depends on us,</i>
<i>on how well we diagnose and treat.</i>

02:26.412 --> 02:28.812
<i>We know the story hinges on us...</i>

02:28.848 --> 02:30.440
He's in v-fib.
Get the crash cart.

02:30.483 --> 02:32.110
<i>...and we all want to be the hero.</i>

02:38.324 --> 02:42.385
Morning, Chief. I heard there was
a guy here with worms in his brain.

02:43.263 --> 02:47.700
Does anyone know the medical term
for worms in the brain?

02:50.370 --> 02:53.464
Dr. Stevens requested you today
for a special project.

02:53.940 --> 02:56.135
OK, take an envelope,
pass the rest back.

02:56.176 --> 02:59.737
Do not open them, you'll need them
for the first game we're gonna play.

02:59.779 --> 03:02.179
That's what we're doing today?
Playing games?

03:02.215 --> 03:04.649
Cheer up.
We are gonna have so much fun!

03:04.684 --> 03:07.346
Don't open! Don't you know
how to play a simple game?

03:07.387 --> 03:10.254
- I did when I was eight.
- Let's just go.

03:14.427 --> 03:17.988
Dr. Bailey's with Addison,
so I'm gonna hand out your assignments.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.589
Addison's in the hospital?

03:19.632 --> 03:22.760
Her brother was admitted
with parasites in his brain.

03:22.835 --> 03:25.929
Addison's brother
has neurocysticercosis?

03:27.373 --> 03:28.840
- See?
- Huh?

03:28.875 --> 03:30.934
That's what I'm taking about!

03:34.948 --> 03:36.779
I cleared my schedule.

03:36.849 --> 03:40.285
- You didn't have to do that. I'm fine.
- Your brother has parasites.

03:40.353 --> 03:42.548
I cleared my schedule.
You cut your hair.

03:42.589 --> 03:46.423
- Yeah.
- I like it. Dr. Miranda Bailey.

03:46.492 --> 03:48.756
I'm sorry.
Miranda, Naomi. Naomi, Miranda.

03:48.795 --> 03:53.095
Naomi's our fertility specialist at
Oceanside and one of my oldest friends.

03:53.132 --> 03:55.225
- Nice to meet you, Miranda.
- How is he?

03:55.268 --> 03:57.862
- I don't know.
- He's groggy.

03:57.904 --> 04:01.863
His eyes are open but I don't think
he's awake. He hasn't tried to kill me.

04:01.908 --> 04:03.637
Her brother hates me.

04:03.676 --> 04:07.442
- People pick sides in a divorce, Derek.
- He picked sides in the marriage.

04:07.480 --> 04:12.315
He first seized during sex with his
girlfriend. Wonder why she's not here?

04:12.986 --> 04:14.920
Oh, she is.

04:16.623 --> 04:18.488
Naomi?

04:18.591 --> 04:20.786
I'm going in there.

04:23.630 --> 04:26.224
- You and Archer?
- No.

04:26.266 --> 04:30.635
Well, yeah.
I don't know. I don't know what we are.

04:31.971 --> 04:33.029
How's Sam?

04:34.607 --> 04:39.135
Sam's good.
And how's... Meredith, is that her name?

04:39.212 --> 04:41.180
She's good.

04:41.814 --> 04:42.906
- Good.
- Yeah.

04:44.884 --> 04:48.786
Look at us. We're making polite
conversation about your girlfriend.

04:49.222 --> 04:51.656
You two are divorced,
me and Sam are divorced.

04:51.724 --> 04:55.023
I'm with Archer, sort of...

04:55.094 --> 04:56.618
What the hell happened?

04:56.663 --> 04:59.461
I mean, you wrote Addison a song, Derek.

04:59.499 --> 05:01.023
Let's forget about the song.

05:01.100 --> 05:02.692
- Enough about the song.
- What?

05:02.735 --> 05:06.262
You wrote her her own love song
and sang it to her at the wedding.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.331
Mark wrote it or Sam. I don't remember.

05:08.408 --> 05:10.569
I do. I was drunk at the time,

05:10.643 --> 05:13.544
but I remember thinking
you were going to last forever.

05:13.613 --> 05:17.105
- We were all gonna last forever.
- Yeah.

05:18.618 --> 05:20.848
You should call Sam. He misses you.

05:21.688 --> 05:22.814
Yeah.

05:25.124 --> 05:27.820
- How'd you sleep?
- Not too well.

05:27.860 --> 05:31.557
- Shoulder pain?
- No. Pain in the ass wife.

05:31.631 --> 05:35.192
I kept him up because I was afraid
my aneurysm was gonna explode

05:35.268 --> 05:37.065
and I was gonna die.

05:37.136 --> 05:40.299
- Hi, I'm Dr. Karev.
- Where's Dr. Grey?

05:40.340 --> 05:42.137
She's supposed to be in my surgery.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.837
She and Dr. Shepherd
got called in on an emergency.

05:44.877 --> 05:47.812
So he's not going to get
to your aneurysm until later.

05:47.847 --> 05:51.544
- Wha... Later when?
- Could be a few hours.

05:51.584 --> 05:53.347
- Could be tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

05:53.386 --> 05:56.048
She's waited until tomorrow.
Today is tomorrow.

05:56.089 --> 05:59.024
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- I'm her husband.

05:59.058 --> 06:02.084
- I look like this because...
- I ran him over with our car.

06:02.128 --> 06:06.394
Before I knew I had
this huge time bomb in my head.

06:06.432 --> 06:10.493
When I was just a big old pregnant
person waiting for her baby.

06:10.536 --> 06:13.198
So, just... please,

06:13.239 --> 06:16.902
if he could get to me
sooner rather than later...

06:16.943 --> 06:19.138
Um...

06:19.712 --> 06:22.442
- What's the emergency?
- Addison's brother.

06:22.515 --> 06:24.107
Addison's here?

06:24.751 --> 06:27.219
We were having dinner
and he just passed out.

06:27.253 --> 06:30.745
I am telling you,
it is probably just my hernia.

06:30.823 --> 06:35.055
He has an inguinal hernia. It doesn't
seem to be the source of obstruction.

06:35.094 --> 06:38.928
It's gonna take these doctors a long
time to figure this out. I'm fine.

06:38.965 --> 06:43.061
- You gotta go to work.
- He hates it when we try to help him.

06:43.102 --> 06:45.593
He's a lot like
my second graders that way.

06:45.638 --> 06:47.469
OK, Daddy. You win.

06:47.540 --> 06:50.566
I have my cell,
so call me if you need me.

06:51.277 --> 06:52.767
Bye.

06:58.217 --> 07:00.481
I have colorectal cancer.

07:00.553 --> 07:04.421
I've had five polyps removed
in the last three years and radiation.

07:04.457 --> 07:07.187
My daughter doesn't know
and I'd like to keep it that way.

07:07.226 --> 07:11.390
Um... Dr. Yang's going to set you up
for a CT with contrast.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.763
Where have you been treated?
We'll need your records.

07:13.800 --> 07:17.292
Columbia Hospital in Verona.
Dr. Shulty.

07:21.541 --> 07:24.977
I... I work here now.

07:25.044 --> 07:26.409
I saw you were in and I...

07:26.446 --> 07:29.745
You waited till she left
to come in and say hello.

07:29.782 --> 07:32.342
Just like you
to face up to things like a man.

07:35.822 --> 07:38.814
You should tell her about the cancer.
She deserves to know.

07:38.891 --> 07:41.519
You lost the right
to tell me anything about her

07:41.594 --> 07:45.223
when you broke off your engagement
in a two line email.

07:58.377 --> 08:03.007
- What was the next line?
- Can we talk about something else?

08:11.424 --> 08:13.517
- Greatest love song of all time.
- Hey!

08:13.559 --> 08:16.995
You get to the part where
Derek rhymes "gross anatomy class"

08:17.029 --> 08:20.556
with "Addison's fine ass,"
because I wrote that line.

08:21.934 --> 08:25.097
- Oh, my bad.
- No, no, it's fine. I, uh...

08:25.137 --> 08:27.298
I think it sounds like a fine song.

08:27.340 --> 08:32.243
Archie, heard you were gonna let Derek
remove those suckers from your brain.

08:32.311 --> 08:34.006
- Maybe.
- He is.

08:34.046 --> 08:37.311
I hate surgery.
Especially brain surgery.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.374
Yeah.

08:38.417 --> 08:41.716
Being a neurologist you
probably see a lot of patients post-op

08:41.754 --> 08:45.246
- who are scrambled eggs up there...
- You're not helping.

08:45.291 --> 08:49.352
We're sitting here trying
to convince him that surgery is...

08:49.395 --> 08:51.056
Is not an option.

08:51.998 --> 08:56.264
According to these scans,
the single cyst you had on your last CT

08:56.302 --> 09:01.001
has now multiplied by eight,
all clogging the third ventricle.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.703
There's no way I could surgically
navigate through a mess like that

09:04.744 --> 09:06.211
without rupturing one.

09:06.245 --> 09:08.543
So, what does that mean?

09:13.419 --> 09:18.482
You're in a room full of doctors,
who are all being very quiet right now.

09:22.728 --> 09:26.129
I'm gonna die. That's what it means.

09:36.042 --> 09:39.569
Inside each one of your envelopes
is the name of a surgery.

09:39.645 --> 09:42.773
Your task is to drape
your patients accordingly.

09:42.848 --> 09:46.409
On your marks, get set... Go!

09:54.360 --> 09:58.592
Come on, lighten up, this is supposed
to be fun. Don't take it so seriously.

09:58.631 --> 10:02.067
You suck at this! My grandmother
could drape better than you!

10:02.101 --> 10:06.470
- I'm sorry. I'll try to do better...
- No, you're doing great.

10:06.505 --> 10:09.372
I'm trash talking.
I'm having fun. It's just... fun.

10:13.713 --> 10:16.147
What are you...? Woo!

10:17.783 --> 10:19.341
Woo! Woo! Woo!

10:19.385 --> 10:22.286
- Looking good! Good job!
- Done!

10:23.723 --> 10:26.817
- Laparoscopic cholecystectomy
- Yeah, that's good.

10:26.859 --> 10:29.851
- Your next challenge.
- I'm done, too.

10:32.198 --> 10:34.666
A whipple is for pancreatic cancer.

10:34.734 --> 10:37.430
Were you planning on
going in through the mouth?

10:38.304 --> 10:39.862
Start over.

10:52.218 --> 10:54.550
There's just no way, Addie.

10:55.154 --> 10:58.351
Dr. Conroy at Cedars
and Larry at Mayo, they agree...

10:58.391 --> 11:03.852
I've put you in a tiny box.

11:04.230 --> 11:08.792
After the divorce I made you
petty and inconsequential

11:08.834 --> 11:10.062
and nothing special,

11:10.102 --> 11:15.540
so that you could fit
into this tiny, little box

11:15.608 --> 11:18.202
that would help me get out of bed
in the morning.

11:18.277 --> 11:19.835
But now...

11:20.680 --> 11:23.513
...now I have to take you
out of the box

11:23.582 --> 11:26.881
because I need to believe
that you can do this,

11:26.952 --> 11:29.147
that you can save my brother.

11:29.188 --> 11:31.213
I need you to be a god.

11:31.257 --> 11:34.920
Just today. Be a god.

11:43.402 --> 11:46.530
Montgomery, Archer. I'm a friend.

11:48.574 --> 11:51.475
I'm Dr. Miranda Bailey.
I'm a friend of Addison's.

11:51.510 --> 11:53.637
- Which one are you?
- I'm sorry?

11:53.679 --> 11:58.207
Archer is Addison's brother. Archer's
girlfriend is Addison's best friend

11:58.250 --> 12:01.276
who married Derek's best friend
who Derek hasn't spoken to

12:01.353 --> 12:03.378
- since the divorce.
- That would be me.

12:03.422 --> 12:06.721
The ex-husband, Dr. Samuel Bennett.

12:07.593 --> 12:11.586
Sorry, I didn't think the ex-husband

12:11.664 --> 12:15.293
would show up at the ex-wife's
boyfriend's bedside.

12:15.367 --> 12:19.098
Don't worry about it.
Even I don't know why I'm here.

12:23.342 --> 12:25.902
- But... yeah.
- Third floor. Room 3420.

12:25.945 --> 12:27.708
Thank you.

12:28.314 --> 12:31.806
- Dr. Bennett.
- Uh... Sam.

12:32.651 --> 12:35.552
Dr. Shepherd is still studying the scans

12:35.588 --> 12:39.024
looking for a way to operate
but it looks like a difficult case.

12:40.726 --> 12:42.318
Right.

12:43.863 --> 12:47.924
Hey, Addison's brother
probably isn't gonna make it.

12:47.967 --> 12:50.765
- His cysts are inoperable.
- Worms in the brain.

12:50.836 --> 12:54.135
- Not how you want to go.
- I didn't know Addison had a brother.

12:54.173 --> 12:57.540
You'd think Derek would have said
something at some point.

12:57.576 --> 13:00.636
Or sang something
while he played his guitar.

13:00.713 --> 13:03.910
- Speak English.
- Derek used to play guitar.

13:03.949 --> 13:06.008
Owen's ex-fiancée is in the hospital.

13:06.051 --> 13:09.646
Mm-hm. His ex-fiancée
he never told me about.

13:10.122 --> 13:13.649
- What's wrong with her?
- She calls her dad "daddy."

13:13.726 --> 13:16.593
No, what's wrong with her?
Why is she in the hospital?

13:16.629 --> 13:19.257
She isn't. Daddy is.

13:20.065 --> 13:22.727
You should ask Owen
if he plays the guitar.

13:25.104 --> 13:26.901
"Find Dr. Sloan, ask his symptoms,

13:26.939 --> 13:31.103
diagnose him correctly to receive your
next challenge!" What are your symptoms?

13:31.143 --> 13:34.943
Right now, I'm battling a rapid heart
rate, also feeling a little flushed.

13:34.980 --> 13:38.143
I don't even want to mention
what's going on below the belt.

13:38.184 --> 13:40.914
I don't do dirty,
secret flirting with you, anymore.

13:40.953 --> 13:44.320
I told you, if you want
to go public with me, with us,

13:44.356 --> 13:48.190
I will do dirty public flirting.
I mean, I will flirt publicly,

13:48.260 --> 13:50.524
not dirtily...

13:50.596 --> 13:52.530
...maybe a little dirtily.

13:52.565 --> 13:55.659
Please tell me your symptoms
so I can concentrate.

13:56.335 --> 14:00.203
Tachycardia, angioedema, hypotension,
severe chest and abdominal pain,

14:00.239 --> 14:02.833
- difficulty breathing, throat closing.
- Anaphylactic shock!

14:02.875 --> 14:05.867
- Whoa! Whoa. Whoa. whoa. Foul!
- What?

14:05.911 --> 14:08.471
- You heard her answer.
- The whole hospital heard.

14:08.514 --> 14:11.574
You should've kept a distance.
New symptoms. Resume play.

14:11.617 --> 14:13.050
Woo!

14:16.689 --> 14:18.623
You must have questions, so ask.

14:18.657 --> 14:22.320
When was his last polypectomy,
since you're familiar with the patient?

14:22.361 --> 14:24.693
- Not what I meant.
- I know what you meant.

14:24.730 --> 14:26.925
- Dr. Yang, symptoms?
- Not a good time...

14:26.966 --> 14:29.662
Heavy feeling in the abdomen,
accompanied by nausea

14:29.702 --> 14:32.466
and an acute pulling sensation
in the scrotum.

14:32.504 --> 14:34.438
Testicular cancer!

14:34.473 --> 14:35.940
Woo!

14:36.909 --> 14:40.003
- Cristina...
- I have to get Mr. Whitman to the CT.

14:41.146 --> 14:43.671
I wasn't doing anyone
any good at school so...

14:48.020 --> 14:49.385
Owen?

14:51.490 --> 14:54.050
I don't understand. What...?

14:54.093 --> 14:55.856
I work here.

14:56.629 --> 14:58.494
What do you mean?

14:59.298 --> 15:00.663
What do you mean?

15:02.101 --> 15:04.968
- Beth.
- When did you get back?

15:09.174 --> 15:11.574
I just saw your mom. She didn't...

15:16.782 --> 15:19.012
I thought you were in Iraq.

15:19.985 --> 15:23.216
I've been praying for you every night.

15:24.723 --> 15:26.588
Every night, I'm on my knees,

15:26.659 --> 15:29.560
praying that
you're gonna make it back,

15:29.595 --> 15:31.586
that you'll make it another 24 hours,

15:31.664 --> 15:34.690
that you... you'll make it home.

15:39.104 --> 15:41.538
Owen, you're back!

16:12.938 --> 16:16.499
- What is she doing?
- It looks like she's praying.

16:16.575 --> 16:19.601
Mm, no... Addie doesn't pray.

16:19.645 --> 16:22.978
- What's she doing?
- Uh, she's praying.

16:23.015 --> 16:25.984
Addison doesn't pray.
She must be hiding.

16:26.018 --> 16:29.351
I can hear you.
I'm not hiding, I am trying to pray,

16:29.388 --> 16:33.051
but I don't know how because I'm a WASP.
We only go to church on Christmas.

16:33.792 --> 16:35.020
You guys go. I got this.

16:50.109 --> 16:54.170
I have no clout with God.

16:55.047 --> 16:58.039
God doesn't even know who I am.

16:58.083 --> 17:00.551
Which sucks, because I could...

17:04.390 --> 17:06.221
...I could use some help.

17:13.632 --> 17:18.296
Dear God, I need your guidance.

17:20.939 --> 17:23.806
- I kissed a peds surgeon.
- You kissed a peds surgeon?

17:23.876 --> 17:26.970
I never thought I'd end up
with a woman. Not until lately.

17:27.046 --> 17:30.812
That's not the problem, the problem
is the peds thing. She's perky...

17:30.883 --> 17:33.579
...and has butterflies
on her scrub cap.

17:34.920 --> 17:38.253
But she's... also hot.

17:39.324 --> 17:42.851
Really hot. So...

17:42.928 --> 17:45.089
...help me get over the butterflies.

17:46.865 --> 17:48.457
Amen.

17:56.742 --> 18:00.576
You're an amazing doctor, you save
babies. God knows who you are.

18:04.817 --> 18:07.012
Do you really believe in all this?

18:08.287 --> 18:10.050
In God?

18:11.256 --> 18:12.814
Sometimes.

18:13.559 --> 18:16.687
Mm. Most of the time.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.627
When it counts.

18:25.170 --> 18:27.604
Your wife's in the chapel, praying.

18:27.639 --> 18:31.200
She's not my wife
and she doesn't pray.

18:32.311 --> 18:33.403
- How are you?
- Hey.

18:35.514 --> 18:37.209
You know, midlife crisis.

18:37.282 --> 18:41.742
I got an earring, but I let
the hole close up the very next day.

18:41.820 --> 18:45.483
- That would have been a good look.
- I met, uh... Meredith.

18:45.524 --> 18:47.617
Uh-huh.

18:48.560 --> 18:52.155
She's not a midlife crisis.
She's the real thing.

18:52.197 --> 18:53.960
That's great. I'm happy for you, man.

18:53.999 --> 18:56.991
- Happy for you.
- Yeah.

18:58.704 --> 19:00.331
- I should have called...
- No.

19:00.372 --> 19:02.237
...stayed in touch. It's my fault.

19:02.307 --> 19:05.333
People move, they change, we all did.

19:05.377 --> 19:08.141
- Yeah.
- So... But, yeah.

19:10.015 --> 19:11.243
She's praying.

19:12.151 --> 19:15.177
Yeah. She's expecting a miracle.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.589
I can't deliver one.

19:19.925 --> 19:23.383
I've seen patients with one cyst
in the ventricle, maybe two.

19:23.428 --> 19:25.191
He has eight.

19:25.230 --> 19:27.494
There is no way
I can get a scope in there

19:27.533 --> 19:29.899
without rupturing one. There's too many.

19:32.838 --> 19:36.569
Maybe you're just too close to it.
What if there were just one?

19:36.608 --> 19:41.045
Explain to me
how you would remove just that one.

19:44.516 --> 19:46.347
110 over 80.

19:46.451 --> 19:48.078
What's the prize for winning?

19:48.120 --> 19:51.214
- They need a prize.
- They're getting a prize.

19:51.256 --> 19:53.019
A really big prize.

19:53.625 --> 19:56.321
- I need a prize.
- What's going on?

19:56.395 --> 20:00.491
Uh, my patients needed a distraction
and Izzie needed real patients.

20:00.566 --> 20:03.797
- How's it going?
- It's going great. We're having fun.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.269
Dr. Grey! Am I going to surgery now?

20:06.338 --> 20:08.306
Could be any time now.

20:11.510 --> 20:13.137
What?

20:13.212 --> 20:15.646
- I can't find it.
- Wh...?

20:15.714 --> 20:19.775
Is something wrong?
Is the baby's heart not beating?

20:19.851 --> 20:22.115
You're on the kid's ass.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.412
The heart's over here.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.934
It's not what you think.

20:38.971 --> 20:42.304
I can guarantee I'm not as much
of an ass as you think I am.

20:43.475 --> 20:45.500
Does your mother know you're back?

20:49.648 --> 20:51.445
Page me when this is done.

20:56.255 --> 21:00.248
Archer, I need to create room in the
ventricle so I can maneuver the scope.

21:00.292 --> 21:02.954
If I deflate each cyst,
the scope can remove them.

21:02.995 --> 21:04.360
The cysts will rupture.

21:04.429 --> 21:07.990
I'm going to grab each one with forceps,
pull it up, suction the fluid.

21:08.066 --> 21:12.127
- Suction would have to be precise.
- It will be.

21:12.170 --> 21:14.468
- You can't do it.
- I think I can.

21:14.506 --> 21:17.566
- Control the way the cyst ruptures?
- No, he can't.

21:17.609 --> 21:20.271
- You want me to go down fighting but...
- Coward.

21:20.312 --> 21:23.281
- Excuse me?
- You're a coward by trade.

21:23.315 --> 21:26.716
You're a neurologist. You feed off us,
refer your patients to us,

21:26.785 --> 21:30.949
let us assume the responsibility,
and if something happens, well...

21:30.989 --> 21:34.686
I can assume the responsibility.
The question is, can you?

22:01.086 --> 22:04.283
- A peds surgery fellowship?
- Yep.

22:04.323 --> 22:07.952
Just when I'm almost done with
general surgery residency. Crazy, huh?

22:07.993 --> 22:11.429
No. Just... surprising.

22:11.463 --> 22:14.455
You don't seem
like a peds person to me.

22:14.499 --> 22:18.299
- Why not?
- Because you don't smile.

22:18.370 --> 22:21.134
- Peds people smile.
- I smile.

22:23.775 --> 22:27.643
Well, I'm not going to smile now.
But I do smile. I smile frequently.

22:28.413 --> 22:31.473
- Hey. He under yet?
- Yeah.

22:33.585 --> 22:35.951
A peds surgery fellowship?

22:36.788 --> 22:38.346
Huh.

22:39.157 --> 22:41.648
I have a child.
I am familiar with children.

22:41.693 --> 22:44.218
I am going to be
an excellent pediatric surgeon!

22:45.063 --> 22:48.590
You're gonna want to keep that temper
in check around the kids.

22:48.633 --> 22:52.967
- Weird seeing Archie on that table.
- Yeah.

22:58.443 --> 23:00.843
Asthma. Looks like I'm low.

23:03.815 --> 23:06.807
Chris, refill this for Dr. Bennett here.

23:06.852 --> 23:08.046
OK.

23:10.522 --> 23:12.888
- Thanks.
- It's good practice.

23:12.958 --> 23:15.324
Asthma's big with the kids.

23:22.634 --> 23:25.865
Say it, Derek. Come on,
say it, say it, say it, say it...

23:30.409 --> 23:34.573
OK, everybody.
It's a beautiful day to save lives.

23:35.046 --> 23:36.308
Scalpel.

23:38.650 --> 23:43.246
- You're gonna have to tell her...
- This is Beth we're talking about.

23:43.321 --> 23:47.417
She worries herself sick when
one of her students gets the sniffles.

23:47.459 --> 23:51.953
She can't handle bad news.
She's a sunshine girl.

23:52.030 --> 23:54.021
And you used to know that about her.

23:55.300 --> 23:57.200
Well, she'll find out eventually.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.273
- Dr. Yang!
- What's going on?

24:04.342 --> 24:06.333
Ruth, call the Chief and reserve an OR.

24:06.378 --> 24:09.472
- Owen?
- It's a...

24:09.514 --> 24:13.143
It's a complication. He needs surgery.

24:13.185 --> 24:15.847
A complication from what?

24:18.223 --> 24:21.624
He's going to be OK.
I'll keep you updated. Let's go.

24:25.931 --> 24:28.229
Entering the third ventricle.

24:34.773 --> 24:37.105
Securing cyst number one.

24:42.347 --> 24:44.042
Deflating cyst one.

24:44.082 --> 24:46.141
Applying suction.

24:58.897 --> 25:00.296
Any sign of the scolex?

25:01.666 --> 25:03.224
There it is.

25:07.939 --> 25:09.998
One at a time.

25:10.842 --> 25:12.332
One at a time.

25:13.778 --> 25:16.576
OK. I need to be distracted.

25:16.615 --> 25:20.381
Someone talk about something other than
what's going on with my brother.

25:20.418 --> 25:22.978
Uh, Mark is good
at talking about himself.

25:25.023 --> 25:28.390
I've been using endoscopy
for head and neck cancer resections.

25:28.426 --> 25:31.554
If I can just
focus the criteria for patients,

25:31.596 --> 25:33.621
I might have a breakthrough on my hands.

25:34.299 --> 25:37.097
- What happened to you?
- He met someone.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.267
Dr. Grey.

25:46.778 --> 25:49.713
Dr. Torres said I had to eat.
I'm sorry.

25:49.748 --> 25:52.239
It's OK. How is it?

25:52.284 --> 25:53.546
It's amazing.

25:58.490 --> 26:01.516
I'm sorry.
It's bland. It's really bland.

26:02.327 --> 26:04.261
I need my surgery now!

26:04.296 --> 26:06.321
What kind of hospital is this?

26:06.364 --> 26:08.730
- How long am I supposed to wait...
- Stop it!

26:10.769 --> 26:13.738
Look... if you don't settle down

26:13.772 --> 26:17.731
your blood pressure's gonna rise
and you're gonna start contracting.

26:17.776 --> 26:22.076
Sorry, because I don't know you,
but you really need to shut up, OK?

26:22.981 --> 26:25.040
All right, look. There.

26:26.885 --> 26:30.446
Look, there's your son's face.

26:31.323 --> 26:35.225
That's what you need to hold on
to for the next couple of hours, OK?

26:46.404 --> 26:50.465
Is that a tumor?

26:50.508 --> 26:53.068
He's gonna need
more aggressive treatment.

26:53.111 --> 26:55.739
- He'll have to tell his daughter now.
- He won't.

26:55.780 --> 27:00.945
Her mother died when she was little. He
feels that's enough sadness for anyone.

27:01.019 --> 27:04.716
He sheltered her, she always had
a nice car, clothes, anything.

27:04.756 --> 27:06.383
She'll find out eventually.

27:06.424 --> 27:09.860
She used to call me in tears when
there was a spider in her apartment.

27:09.894 --> 27:11.725
Became a joke between Michael and I.

27:11.763 --> 27:16.132
Neither of us could be out of town at
the same time in case Beth found a bug.

27:16.201 --> 27:20.934
When he needs to go through chemo
or gets so sick he needs hospice care,

27:20.972 --> 27:24.931
she'll find out when it's already over.
She deserves more than that.

27:28.613 --> 27:30.046
What's the number?

27:30.081 --> 27:31.878
Seven cysts, seven scolices.

27:31.916 --> 27:33.907
OK, one more.

27:38.023 --> 27:39.650
Damn it!

27:46.665 --> 27:50.999
- He's getting bradycardic.
- See if the flow is blocked.

27:53.938 --> 27:56.566
Asystole.
Start the code clock.

27:59.811 --> 28:04.339
- Derek, asystole.
- Where the hell is it?

28:04.382 --> 28:08.250
- Get the crash cart. Compressions!
- No! Stop. Nobody move.

28:08.286 --> 28:10.186
We can't. I have to find the worm.

28:10.221 --> 28:13.349
- But he's...
- We have two, three minutes. Stop.

28:17.595 --> 28:21.156
- How long's he been down?
- Two minutes, twenty seconds.

28:25.003 --> 28:26.129
There.

28:30.308 --> 28:31.935
Got it.

28:33.144 --> 28:34.236
Damn it.

28:34.979 --> 28:40.007
It's starting to tear apart. Maybe if
I rotate and reverse it back. Yeah.

28:47.759 --> 28:49.659
And that's number eight.

28:51.696 --> 28:53.687
Heartrate's coming back up!

28:54.966 --> 28:56.661
OK.

28:58.970 --> 29:02.462
Thank you, everybody. You made
some friends of mine very happy.

29:06.144 --> 29:08.112
Just got out of surgery.
What's going on?

29:08.146 --> 29:09.545
- Any minute.
- She needs a prize.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.742
Big prize, but not too big,

29:11.816 --> 29:15.877
because they did take out their own
appendixes and they're being punished

29:15.954 --> 29:20.254
and you think they're not even qualified
to hold a clamp. So...

29:20.291 --> 29:21.986
Do you have prizes like that?

29:22.026 --> 29:24.961
They got their symptoms
from their final patients.

29:24.996 --> 29:27.396
Get out the finish line,
it's gonna be close.

29:37.509 --> 29:41.036
- Here they come!
- Come on!

29:41.112 --> 29:43.808
Come on, bring it in!

30:05.804 --> 30:07.237
- George?
- Three-way tie.

30:07.739 --> 30:10.173
- Ok, final diagnosis?
- Motion sickness!

30:10.208 --> 30:11.368
- No!
- Dengue Fever!

30:11.409 --> 30:13.570
- No!
- Neurocycticercosis!

30:13.611 --> 30:15.636
Ladies and gentlemen, a winner!

30:15.680 --> 30:17.443
Whoo! Ha!

30:17.482 --> 30:19.040
Nicely done.

30:19.784 --> 30:20.978
- Yes!
- Worms?

30:21.019 --> 30:22.884
Wait, what's the prize?

30:22.921 --> 30:26.880
You get to scrub in on Shepherd's
craniotomy and hold the doomsday sucker.

30:27.992 --> 30:30.517
- What's a doomsday sucker?
- Doomsday sucker?

30:30.562 --> 30:32.496
It's just a really big sucker.

30:33.598 --> 30:36.089
<i>Dr. Leone,</i>
<i>call the blood bank.</i>

30:36.134 --> 30:38.432
<i>Dr. Leone, call the blood bank.</i>

30:40.438 --> 30:44.374
It was a hard surgery, some of
the bowel was dead as we suspected,

30:44.409 --> 30:48.038
but we were able to remove
the diseased parts successfully.

30:48.079 --> 30:50.912
He's in recovery.
You can see him in about an hour.

30:52.684 --> 30:56.586
- You don't even look like yourself.
- Excuse me?

30:56.621 --> 30:58.919
You don't.

30:58.957 --> 31:02.393
You look... hard.

31:02.427 --> 31:03.985
And...

31:05.063 --> 31:07.793
Look, I know it wasn't easy over there,

31:07.866 --> 31:11.063
I hear people come back and...

31:11.903 --> 31:17.364
I know you can't just come back
and be normal right away, but...

31:17.408 --> 31:20.172
He'll be asleep for a couple hours.
You can see him now.

31:21.479 --> 31:23.811
Two lines in an email?

31:25.083 --> 31:27.108
I deserve more than that.

31:32.824 --> 31:36.089
Beth, your dad has colorectal cancer.

31:36.127 --> 31:39.358
He's been through radiation treatments
and polyp removals.

31:39.430 --> 31:41.159
He didn't tell you...

31:42.667 --> 31:44.999
...because he didn't
want to burden you.

31:46.070 --> 31:48.470
He'd like to spare you any pain.

31:50.475 --> 31:52.136
Any more pain.

32:05.290 --> 32:07.554
He had all these friends.

32:07.625 --> 32:10.253
They sang and they played guitar.

32:11.496 --> 32:13.896
It's like he was a
totally different person.

32:13.932 --> 32:16.560
He was.

32:16.601 --> 32:19.161
It freaks me out a little bit.

32:20.705 --> 32:22.639
I feel like I don't know him.

32:23.474 --> 32:26.068
Well, I don't know Owen.

32:26.778 --> 32:29.747
We don't. We don't know them.

32:36.487 --> 32:40.218
Sadie. Hey, hold up. Hold up.

32:40.291 --> 32:43.556
I wanted to let you know,
I'm happy to help you, if you'd like.

32:43.594 --> 32:47.189
Reviewing the basics or putting
in supervised skills lab hours.

32:47.231 --> 32:51.429
- Excuse me?
- I was a repeater earlier this year,

32:51.502 --> 32:53.868
I know how easy it is to get behind.

32:55.640 --> 32:58.040
- I don't need a tutor.
- You don't?

32:58.076 --> 33:01.375
- No.
- At this point in your training,

33:01.412 --> 33:04.347
you should be able to
hear symptoms, diagnose the problem

33:04.382 --> 33:07.909
and decide whether or not a patient
needs surgery. Can you do that?

33:10.254 --> 33:12.586
Can you?

33:14.692 --> 33:17.354
Because they think you can.

33:17.395 --> 33:20.455
And they will put you
in situations where you have to.

33:25.903 --> 33:27.928
Sadie, you could hurt someone!

33:43.554 --> 33:46.682
I call her. I call my mother.

33:46.758 --> 33:48.953
Once a week.

33:49.027 --> 33:52.360
I haven't told her I'm back,
she thinks that I'm calling from...

33:55.466 --> 33:58.458
I keep the conversations short.
I can't bear for her to know

33:58.503 --> 34:01.631
that the son
she sent off to war is gone.

34:03.207 --> 34:04.504
He's gone.

34:06.077 --> 34:11.071
And if I just got in my car and drove
six miles to see her she'd be so... sad.

34:11.114 --> 34:14.141
And she would look at me
the same way that Beth does now.

34:15.353 --> 34:17.547
Like I'm not there.

34:20.425 --> 34:24.953
The only time I don't feel
like a ghost is when you look at me.

34:24.996 --> 34:29.023
Because you look at me
and you see me. You see me.

34:29.100 --> 34:31.795
This is me. This... is me.

34:34.472 --> 34:36.371
Please, Cristina, see me.

34:38.042 --> 34:39.771
See me.

34:59.263 --> 35:01.231
Jen, I am so sorry.

35:01.299 --> 35:03.631
I have you scheduled
first thing tomorrow.

35:03.668 --> 35:08.970
Derek. I'm using your first name now.

35:09.006 --> 35:12.066
I like you a lot
and I'm starting to consider us friends,

35:12.143 --> 35:15.635
so I'm using your first name
and calling you Derek. And Derek?

35:15.680 --> 35:19.548
I'm begging you please, please

35:19.584 --> 35:22.075
don't make me wait another night.

35:24.856 --> 35:26.881
- She's good.
- Try being married to her.

35:26.924 --> 35:28.949
You'll never say "no" again.

35:32.396 --> 35:34.125
Dr. Grey.

35:35.233 --> 35:37.861
It would appear that
congratulations are in order.

35:37.902 --> 35:38.994
Thank you, Dr. Sloan.

35:39.036 --> 35:42.733
I'd also like it acknowledged
that I offer these congratulations

35:42.807 --> 35:45.435
professionally and respectfully,

35:45.510 --> 35:49.241
without any innuendo
or inappropriate body language.

35:49.747 --> 35:52.739
Acknowledged, Dr. Sloan. Do you know...

35:54.418 --> 35:56.579
What's a doomsday sucker?

35:57.221 --> 35:59.655
- Addison Montgomery.
- Uh, Lexie Grey.

36:00.424 --> 36:03.916
- Mark. Addie. Little Grey.
- Little Grey? Hmm.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.987
I have to meet you at Joe's in a bit.
I have a craniotomy.

36:07.031 --> 36:10.626
- You're holding the doomsday sucker.
- Now?

36:10.668 --> 36:13.933
- Great. Yes! Yes, sir.
- OR 2. See you there.

36:15.773 --> 36:17.604
Doomsday sucker.

36:18.109 --> 36:21.010
- Can you believe Little Grey and...
- Did you hear?

36:21.078 --> 36:24.309
Derek's going to propose to Meredith.
How about that?

36:24.348 --> 36:26.111
I'm off to surgery.

36:31.122 --> 36:32.282
What?

36:33.958 --> 36:35.323
Hey.

36:40.798 --> 36:44.894
- Iz, what's going on with you?
- Nothing.

36:44.936 --> 36:49.532
I'm fine. You saw.
The interns are not a bunch of losers.

36:49.574 --> 36:52.668
They know things.
They're gonna make good doctors.

36:52.710 --> 36:54.735
Really, I'm fine.

36:54.779 --> 36:57.111
I'm fine.

36:58.149 --> 37:01.209
She knows nothing. Nothing.

37:01.252 --> 37:05.120
She's a danger to the patients. I told
her she could tell the Chief or I could.

37:05.156 --> 37:07.818
I wanted to let you know,
because you're her friend.

37:07.892 --> 37:12.727
Although for the life of me, I don't
know how you two were ever friends.

37:18.502 --> 37:20.561
- What happened?
- I quit.

37:20.605 --> 37:23.130
O'Malley's a little narc.

37:23.174 --> 37:25.768
I'd rather be deemed a quitter
than a cheater.

37:27.878 --> 37:30.278
Did you cheat your way
into the program?

37:32.149 --> 37:35.812
I said I'm not book smart.
You know that.

37:35.853 --> 37:37.787
I learn on my feet.

37:37.822 --> 37:41.053
I thought if I came
to where you were, you could...

37:41.459 --> 37:42.517
Pull you through?

37:43.294 --> 37:45.922
We've seen each other through a lot.

37:46.864 --> 37:50.163
We're not 25
sleeping our way through Europe anymore.

37:51.235 --> 37:53.567
We could, though. Think about it.

37:53.638 --> 37:57.130
- We could get on a plane and go...
- No! No.

37:57.174 --> 37:59.904
I can't. I have to work.

37:59.944 --> 38:01.878
I can't just...

38:03.881 --> 38:06.008
Well, you know...

38:06.050 --> 38:08.416
They've sucked the life
right out of you.

38:08.452 --> 38:11.944
- The Meredith I used to know...
- Is right here.

38:12.456 --> 38:14.083
I'm here.

38:14.158 --> 38:17.889
I don't want to sleep my way through
Europe anymore. I want to be here.

38:19.830 --> 38:22.162
I want to be here.

38:28.472 --> 38:30.531
- Sucker at the ready?
- Sucker's at the ready.

38:33.244 --> 38:35.610
- You're mocking me.
- Only a little.

38:36.681 --> 38:39.377
- Damn it. Damn it!
- What? What happened?

38:39.417 --> 38:40.714
BP's 88 over 60.

38:40.751 --> 38:42.184
Hang two units of blood.

38:42.219 --> 38:45.450
All joking aside, Dr. Grey,
bring in the doomsday sucker.

38:45.489 --> 38:47.753
- OK.
- Right in here. Go right in here.

38:49.260 --> 38:50.955
Oh my God. Wow.

38:50.995 --> 38:52.724
- Temporary clips.
- Wow.

38:52.763 --> 38:54.754
Wow. Wow!

38:55.232 --> 38:56.290
Wow.

38:56.801 --> 38:58.496
Microsutures, please.

38:59.370 --> 39:01.565
BP's 110 over 72.

39:02.606 --> 39:04.574
OK, get the sucker out of there.

39:04.608 --> 39:06.701
Is that it? Did you get it?

39:08.713 --> 39:10.647
There's good flow.

39:11.882 --> 39:13.577
Yes, we did it.

39:14.585 --> 39:18.385
And that will teach me to
never mock an eager young intern again.

39:25.529 --> 39:28.123
- I'm an ass.
- You're such an ass.

39:28.165 --> 39:29.996
I shouldn't have blurted.

39:30.067 --> 39:33.195
- A little warning would've been nice.
- But you're OK?

39:33.237 --> 39:35.603
You know, it's strange. I...

39:35.639 --> 39:37.800
I expected this horrible feeling,

39:37.842 --> 39:41.437
this wave of sadness or something,
to just take over.

39:41.479 --> 39:44.937
But... people get divorced,

39:44.982 --> 39:48.145
they meet new people, they re-marry.

39:48.219 --> 39:52.155
I don't know,
maybe it was seeing Archer in that OR,

39:52.189 --> 39:55.784
it just changed my perspective.

39:55.826 --> 39:57.123
Or something.

39:58.429 --> 40:01.193
But you sort of wished
it had been you first.

40:01.232 --> 40:04.565
Shut it! Are you gonna
tell Derek about the...

40:04.602 --> 40:07.366
Wait. If we called Meredith
the 12-year-old,

40:07.405 --> 40:10.533
- What do we call Lexie? A preschooler?
- She's a woman.

40:10.574 --> 40:13.975
- Oh, OK.
- And I'm gonna tell him.

40:14.011 --> 40:16.309
I'm working on it.

40:16.347 --> 40:18.144
There he is!

40:19.784 --> 40:21.945
That's the kind of welcome I deserve!

40:22.453 --> 40:26.822
- Joe! Scotch for the neuro god!
- You were a god today.

40:26.857 --> 40:31.658
You were a god in that OR. You slew
dragons, you walked on water. You...

40:31.695 --> 40:34.220
You were a god, but now?

40:34.298 --> 40:37.825
Now you need to get very tiny again.

40:38.936 --> 40:40.597
And go back in the box.

40:42.306 --> 40:44.536
- How was your craniotomy?
- It was fine.

40:44.608 --> 40:46.576
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I stopped in on Archer.

40:46.610 --> 40:47.872
Things are good.

40:47.912 --> 40:50.847
Good.

40:55.219 --> 40:56.777
- Oh, God!
- Shut up.

41:03.093 --> 41:05.118
We can't remember the chorus.

41:05.162 --> 41:09.394
We got all the way through the second
verse, your name starts the chorus.

41:16.574 --> 41:19.702
It wasn't "summery."
I'd never use "summery" as a noun.

41:19.743 --> 41:23.941
- "I met her in the summer, she..."
- "Summer, she?" Really?

41:23.981 --> 41:25.949
- Yeah.
- Come on.

41:25.983 --> 41:27.041
Clever.

41:31.021 --> 41:32.955
This is why I don't stay in touch.

42:03.821 --> 42:04.981
Aw, gee.

42:05.022 --> 42:06.250
Yeah, you got it.

42:06.857 --> 42:09.087
Oh, hopeless. Cheers.

42:09.126 --> 42:11.390
Wonderful. God.

42:14.698 --> 42:17.963
- What's happening?
- Page Shepherd. Now!
