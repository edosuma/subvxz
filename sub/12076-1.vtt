01:50.520 --> 01:52.670
What the fuck is that?
- What?

01:55.240 --> 01:57.117
Is that an egg?

01:58.200 --> 01:59.872
Looks just like you.

01:59.960 --> 02:02.872
Yeah, they made me paint that
when I signed up.

02:02.960 --> 02:04.632
Some stupid clown thing.

02:04.760 --> 02:06.830
Fuck me, clown! Fuck me, clown!

02:06.920 --> 02:12.153
Fuck me, clown! Fuck me, clown!
Come on, clown. Fuck me, clown!

02:12.240 --> 02:13.673
Fuck me, I'm late.

02:14.640 --> 02:18.269
I've gotta do some little bastard's party.
I need to kit up.

02:22.880 --> 02:24.950
Close the door, asshole!

02:30.320 --> 02:33.517
Here comes the cake.

02:33.840 --> 02:37.515
Here's your cake. Are you ready?
Blow out the candles.

02:43.160 --> 02:44.673
Nine, ten! Yes.

03:03.640 --> 03:08.031
Yeah look, I'll be back in about an hour.
Keep yourself on the boil. Aye.

03:09.040 --> 03:13.636
What are you talking about, love? Yeah.
There's some biscuits under the sink.

03:20.040 --> 03:22.952
Hey, you two. Not in the house.
- Go to hell.

03:26.120 --> 03:29.317
Gimme here.
- You stop it.

03:29.720 --> 03:31.073
Stop. Will you stop!

03:34.120 --> 03:35.792
Gimme that.

03:38.720 --> 03:40.233
You can see my house from here.

03:44.280 --> 03:46.350
Happy birthday.

03:46.640 --> 03:50.110
Tom and Kate sitting in a tree...

04:00.120 --> 04:01.917
Get out of the way, you little bastards.

04:14.080 --> 04:15.911
How do?
- You're late.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.753
And you're fucking ugly.
Just kidding, love.

04:19.720 --> 04:23.838
Right, it's cash up front.
No dough, no show.

04:26.960 --> 04:29.679
Right, here he is, Stitches the Clown.
Whoo-hoo.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.197
Everybody happy?

04:36.400 --> 04:39.756
Is everybody happy?
- You're an asshole, you big dumb clown.

04:40.160 --> 04:42.276
Get on with the show, you loser.

04:43.520 --> 04:44.794
Yes.

04:45.600 --> 04:47.033
Bastards.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.997
Right, who's the birthday boy?

05:00.160 --> 05:02.071
It's a clown.
- That's gonna be worth nothing.

05:02.160 --> 05:03.673
That's plastic.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.834
Right, the hat of mystery.

05:09.760 --> 05:14.038
Who, empty hat. Empty...

05:15.760 --> 05:17.796
Now that's what I'm talking about.

05:19.440 --> 05:21.715
What you want to see?
- A stegosaurus.

05:21.840 --> 05:25.469
The balloons for the dinosaurs
are extinct. You can have a dog.

05:25.560 --> 05:28.597
I don't want a dog. I want a stegosaurus.
- Shut it you.

05:28.720 --> 05:31.518
You shut it. You're not my dad. Shut up.
- I might be.

05:32.080 --> 05:35.675
Right, here we go.
- What is that even supposed to be?

05:35.760 --> 05:40.754
It's a bloody velociraptor, isn't it?
Look, there's a bit there.

05:42.720 --> 05:43.755
Bastard.

05:43.840 --> 05:48.197
Fall in, men, fall in. At ease.
Attention.

05:48.680 --> 05:52.559
You're rubbish.
- I hate this trick.

05:55.360 --> 05:57.351
Can this guy juggle?

05:59.480 --> 06:01.789
How could your mother get this guy?

06:05.840 --> 06:08.957
Right, kids.
Now it's time for Funny Bones.

06:09.200 --> 06:10.349
Are you serious?

06:10.440 --> 06:13.876
Say hello, Funny Bones.
"Hello Funny Bones."

06:14.040 --> 06:15.553
Goodbye, Funny Bones.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.195
Nice one.
- You are so violent.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.714
Here it is. Juggling.

06:31.880 --> 06:33.313
Throw it at him.

06:41.600 --> 06:44.160
Finally this clown does something good.

07:52.520 --> 07:53.794
You bastard.

07:59.080 --> 08:02.197
OK, anybody want...

08:23.720 --> 08:25.995
Get out of my way, bitch.

08:56.960 --> 08:59.155
Try and get some sleep.

11:17.160 --> 11:20.072
You are not our charge.

11:20.160 --> 11:25.871
But hear this. A clown that doesn't finish
a party can never rest in peace.

11:26.200 --> 11:32.196
And the joke is never as funny
the second time round.

11:56.040 --> 12:00.272
Six o'clock in the morning? Couldn't you
have found an earlier flight, Denise?

12:00.360 --> 12:03.318
I don't know how I'm gonna
stay awake in the meeting.

12:03.400 --> 12:07.916
No, don't worry.
I know my way around London.

12:09.560 --> 12:12.279
Yeah, happier times.
Anyway, I better go. All right, bye.

12:13.320 --> 12:15.151
Well, all under control.

12:18.480 --> 12:19.993
Looks good.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.149
You OK?

12:27.120 --> 12:30.556
Yeah, just homework.
I got a maths test on Friday.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.155
And you're not gonna be here
for my birthday.

12:33.240 --> 12:35.913
Oi, you little shit.

12:37.760 --> 12:40.354
Tom, I'm sorry, but if I don't go,
they'll send Bernie,

12:40.440 --> 12:43.318
and I can't loose any more hours
to that cunt.

12:43.400 --> 12:46.437
If you're worried about being on your own,
call one of your friends?

12:46.520 --> 12:48.909
Ask them to come over.
- I'll think about it.

12:52.640 --> 12:54.358
What's the matter?

12:56.080 --> 12:57.672
I don't like the look of it.

13:26.120 --> 13:27.189
Happy birthday.

14:06.280 --> 14:10.159
Do you have your lunches, honey?
- Yes, Mom. Just shut up.

14:13.240 --> 14:16.357
How's it going? You all right?
- Don't bother.

14:16.440 --> 14:21.958
Yeah, gagging for it.
- Yeah, gagging for nothing. Get a grip.

14:22.040 --> 14:23.234
Cock-fucking bitch.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.436
Wanker.
- Twat.

14:31.440 --> 14:32.714
Prick.

14:37.920 --> 14:41.515
Kate, you should've been there.
Jammed four hours straight last night.

14:41.600 --> 14:45.388
Fintan described one of my solos as
"brainal penetration".

14:45.520 --> 14:48.159
I played so hard you couldn't
hear the rest of the band.

14:48.280 --> 14:51.272
I'm thinking of changing
our band name to 'Dan'.

14:51.360 --> 14:55.319
Fintan was so moved by a solo
that he wept four hours.

14:55.400 --> 15:00.269
We had to play without a drummer.
I just worked the bass drum on my foot.

15:00.360 --> 15:05.639
Still, I wish my number one groupie
could've been there.

15:05.720 --> 15:09.190
Hey, not in school.
And I'm not your groupie.

15:10.080 --> 15:14.039
So you gonna get a phone? Ring me maybe?
- I've got three phones.

15:14.120 --> 15:16.395
You were supposed to ring about eight.
- I was busy.

15:16.480 --> 15:22.316
Yeah, obviously listening to your solos.
- And working a bass drum with my foot.

15:22.440 --> 15:26.433
I'm really sick of you not calling,
so maybe you should sit that out.

15:27.400 --> 15:32.235
OK, I'll just see you later.
- I'll...

15:33.480 --> 15:34.833
Kate?

15:36.800 --> 15:41.669
Hey, Tom, can I have that homework?
English class, five minutes. Please.

15:44.080 --> 15:45.354
I haven't done it.

15:45.440 --> 15:49.433
Come on, baby, you scratch my back,
I'll scratch your back.

15:50.960 --> 15:54.111
If that's OK with you?
- I'd really rather you didn't.

15:54.200 --> 16:00.116
I think, Tom,
we're still mates, aren't we?

16:03.040 --> 16:06.476
Sorry there, fuck-face.
I mean apologies, old bean.

16:09.560 --> 16:11.357
Ta-ra for now, love.

16:15.520 --> 16:20.548
OK, settle down.
Page 36.

16:22.680 --> 16:26.434
Try and answer a couple of them
on your own this time.

16:26.520 --> 16:29.717
Who's the new chick?
- She's not new. That's Marry.

16:30.840 --> 16:32.751
Mary? You're fucking shitting me.

16:35.880 --> 16:38.394
What the fuck?
- You seen Monster Munch Mary?

16:38.480 --> 16:42.553
Yeah, she hasn't been Monster Munch Mary
since last summer.

16:42.640 --> 16:46.076
She went to boot camp
or took a massive shit or something.

17:06.839 --> 17:10.116
Hey, are you doing anything this weekend,
on Saturday?

17:10.280 --> 17:11.473
No.

17:11.640 --> 17:14.757
Maybe you could come around.
We could have a couple of beers.

17:14.839 --> 17:17.035
I've got a box set of Vin Diesel movies.

17:17.119 --> 17:20.271
Hold on. You have a free house?
- But not like that.

17:20.359 --> 17:22.430
Who's coming?
- No one, just you.

17:24.520 --> 17:29.548
What about Richie and Bulger?
- No, two's company. Three's a party.

17:29.920 --> 17:34.072
Did someone say "party"?
- Party? Will there be cake?

17:34.160 --> 17:36.720
There's not fucking party.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.756
No talking.

17:41.320 --> 17:42.958
No talking in class.

18:03.400 --> 18:04.879
Oh fuck!

18:09.600 --> 18:13.752
And here we have
the male reproductive organ.

18:17.960 --> 18:20.793
Presto.
- Oh my God, look how small that is.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.558
Give me back my dick.

18:30.680 --> 18:32.318
Give me it back.

18:33.520 --> 18:35.158
Your time is up, Tom.

18:36.640 --> 18:41.191
Your time is up. Please hand in
your papers, ladies and gentlemen.

18:41.480 --> 18:46.634
Thank you again for your sterling efforts.
That will be all for today.

18:47.520 --> 18:50.876
Blondie, more of a stretch here.
Lose those pounds. You've put too many on.

18:50.960 --> 18:54.794
Scarecrow, come on. Do something there.
You in the pink, you sissy, move.

18:54.880 --> 18:56.916
Betty Boo, more of an effort into that.

18:57.160 --> 18:59.628
Come on, Fatso.
Get a move on there, Specky.

18:59.720 --> 19:03.554
Here, what are you doing standing?
Get a move on it. That's very good.

19:03.640 --> 19:08.191
You do that. Hey Magic, get rid of
that fucking ball and start stretching.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.999
Yeah. What the...

19:17.640 --> 19:20.712
Are you ordering food online again?
- No.

19:22.400 --> 19:25.790
Of all the people to have a free house
and he doesn't wanna have a party.

19:25.880 --> 19:27.916
Vinny, give him a break.
- Why?

19:28.000 --> 19:31.276
Because it's his birthday this weekend.

19:32.240 --> 19:34.276
It's his birthday this weekend?
- Yeah.

19:34.400 --> 19:35.958
Like this weekend coming?

19:36.040 --> 19:39.157
Yes, this weekend coming.
It's his birthday.

19:40.600 --> 19:43.068
And garlic bread.

19:43.320 --> 19:46.676
I was thinking, this weekend,
total surprise party for Tom.

19:46.760 --> 19:50.753
Dude, that's like flashing a strobe light
at an epileptic. Can't do it.

19:50.840 --> 19:52.592
Let's get it on.

19:56.920 --> 19:59.354
Bulger, gimme the ball.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.229
Earth to Tom.
Wake up, you lazy bastard.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.476
Dude, you should have this party.
- No.

20:17.560 --> 20:23.078
Kate and Dan are at breaking point.
You can put that six year boner to use.

20:23.240 --> 20:25.549
Don't say anything.
Just think about it.

20:25.640 --> 20:27.710
You're a legend, Tom.

20:28.080 --> 20:30.548
Shoot it, Tom.
- Shoot it. Come on.

22:11.800 --> 22:13.756
Wait, wait, wait.

22:16.000 --> 22:20.152
Vinny. Richie. Bulger.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.672
Holy shit. It's on.
- It's on.

22:24.760 --> 22:25.988
It's actually happening?
- Yep.

22:26.080 --> 22:28.230
Oh my God. This is amazing.

22:28.360 --> 22:30.555
There'll be cake and everything, Bulger.
- Whatever.

22:30.640 --> 22:33.677
Tom, are we doing presents?
You know I don't do that sort of thing.

22:50.000 --> 22:54.357
You, Kate. What did I tell you about
wearing those boots in school?

22:54.440 --> 22:56.351
Not to.
- Not to.

22:56.440 --> 22:59.000
Footwear is supposed to be black or brown.

22:59.080 --> 23:00.832
How's it a uniform if there's a choice?

23:00.920 --> 23:04.913
This isn't a conversation. I'm not asking
you. What are you now? Emo?

23:05.000 --> 23:07.992
You'll dye you hair pink next,
and a nose ring.

23:08.080 --> 23:10.435
And then there'll be the drugs.
And five years down the line...

23:10.520 --> 23:13.910
you're in a bedsit by yourself
eating your own hair.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.629
Oh, it's funny. Laugh it up.
That tickled you, did it?

23:17.720 --> 23:21.679
4a. Four o'clock. Detained.
I'll be in to check on you.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.472
You're not laughing now.
And here.

23:23.560 --> 23:27.439
If I catch you with those boots again,
it'll be a letter home.

23:28.320 --> 23:29.912
Hey!

23:34.080 --> 23:36.310
He's such an asshole.

23:36.440 --> 23:38.670
Hi, Kate.
- Oh, hi.

23:38.760 --> 23:41.479
How you doing?
- I just got detention.

23:41.560 --> 23:46.076
Remember that time in Mrs Burke's class
when she gave us detention for laughing?

23:47.920 --> 23:49.672
I've got something for you.

23:56.520 --> 23:59.114
Having a party?
- Yeah.

23:59.200 --> 24:02.954
I don't know about this Saturday yet.
I might be going out.

24:03.600 --> 24:05.511
Oh right, with friends.

24:05.600 --> 24:11.311
Yeah, just some of the girls.
- Well, you can invite them, too.

24:11.440 --> 24:13.874
There's plenty of room.
- Yeah?

24:13.960 --> 24:18.158
Sure.
- OK. I'll say it to them and see.

24:18.240 --> 24:23.837
Dress code for Saturday is smart casual,
so I don't want to see those shoes,

24:23.920 --> 24:25.592
or I'll be sending a
letter home to your mammy.

24:29.080 --> 24:31.116
7B. Mr Cliffords, maths, yeah?

24:31.200 --> 24:33.634
Yes, sir.
- Chop chop, yeah?

24:33.720 --> 24:35.517
You little fucker, you.

25:03.840 --> 25:07.799
It was completely off-key.
Why are you still here?

25:10.120 --> 25:11.792
Jesus, didn't mean to scare you, Tom.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.719
Looking very sharp.
Any plans for the weekend?

25:15.120 --> 25:17.918
None yet.
- Are you gonna play that card?

25:18.000 --> 25:24.678
Well, we saw the event page.
You invited everyone to come on My Face.

25:25.960 --> 25:28.918
No, I didn't do that.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.956
Are you lying to me?
- No.

25:31.040 --> 25:34.953
I can see it in your beady fucking
posh eyes. You're lying, Tom.

25:35.040 --> 25:39.113
Me and the ATB will come to your house.
Do you know who the ATB are?

25:41.160 --> 25:44.994
All the boys. All the fucking boys.

25:46.040 --> 25:50.875
Come on, Sarah. Give 'Thomas the
Tank Engine' his birthday present.

25:57.880 --> 26:02.829
Birthday bashings.
- You're OK, Tommy. See you Saturday.

26:04.040 --> 26:06.315
I bet you wouldn't even know
how to kiss a girl.

26:06.400 --> 26:10.359
If you saw a girl's gash,
you'd put a plaster on it.

26:18.600 --> 26:21.797
All right, man?
- What have been saying about my party?

26:21.880 --> 26:24.792
Spreading the word.
You have 32 friends already.

26:24.880 --> 26:30.079
I don't even know 32 people.
- You will. Trust me. It's gonna be good.

26:30.320 --> 26:31.435
Yeah?

26:56.320 --> 26:58.436
Not the same shitty bike again.

27:13.920 --> 27:15.239
Bring on the chuck.

28:39.360 --> 28:42.750
Hey! Hurry up, Bulger, you fat fuck.

28:43.040 --> 28:45.270
Party. Woo-hoo!
- Someone's got a bit of drink.

28:45.360 --> 28:47.794
This place brings back memories.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.388
Nice.
- Yeah.

28:49.480 --> 28:51.516
There's Bulger.
- There he is.

28:51.600 --> 28:54.637
Hurry guys. Let's go. We've work to do.
- Nice.

29:00.720 --> 29:04.269
Three hours to go. Let's get to work.
- Relax. We just got in the door.

29:04.360 --> 29:08.114
Richie, where's the peanuts?
You forgot them, didn't you?

29:08.200 --> 29:11.158
Richie, shut up.
Get you head in the game.

29:21.640 --> 29:25.599
Tom, this is easy.
Righty tighty, lefty loosey.

29:26.120 --> 29:29.112
Richie, that needs to go higher.
You have it arse ways.

29:29.200 --> 29:31.668
Fuck off.
- No, you fuck off, Richie.

29:31.800 --> 29:34.633
Righty tighty, lefty loosey.

29:36.400 --> 29:37.833
What are you doing?

29:37.960 --> 29:41.589
Blow these up. Can someone cover up
those bins? They look terrible.

29:44.800 --> 29:48.110
Did you get the crepe paper?
- I bought skins.

29:48.200 --> 29:50.395
You bought skins?
- That what you meant?

29:50.480 --> 29:51.799
No, I meant crepe paper.

29:51.880 --> 29:55.509
But don't worry. It's only been
his first party in like six years.

29:59.960 --> 30:03.475
Good work.
- Now all we need is some bodies.

30:03.560 --> 30:05.835
Bring on the fanny fest.

30:56.240 --> 31:00.074
Oh, sorry. Sorry, ladies.
You having a good night?

31:00.160 --> 31:03.357
Uh, yes. Thanks.
- I'm Richie. What's your name?

31:09.360 --> 31:11.396
Wanker.

31:11.760 --> 31:16.914
It's OK. Aside from the random nobodies
and all the ugly people.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.993
Well, no, I look fierce,
but the rest of them, please.

31:23.520 --> 31:29.675
Oh my God. Just a random uglier
in the shortest dress ever.

31:29.760 --> 31:32.274
You can practically see her thing.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.317
Lots of people here.
- It's deadly.

31:50.400 --> 31:53.198
Is it?
- Yeah.

31:53.280 --> 31:55.589
Have you seen Kate?
- No. Oh my God, there she is.

31:57.200 --> 32:00.351
What's going on?
- She's too good for you.

32:00.480 --> 32:03.836
No, no. When she's had a few drinks,
I'm telling you... - Whatever.

32:03.960 --> 32:06.394
Those blow-job lips
will be gagging for mickey.

32:07.680 --> 32:10.638
Here, lads, group shot.
Let me see those fuck faces.

32:12.240 --> 32:13.639
Bulger, that's a fuck face?

32:15.920 --> 32:17.558
Did you get the fairy lights?

32:17.640 --> 32:20.677
Oh God. Delete that.
I've such a double chin.

32:20.760 --> 32:22.955
Fuck's sake, Tom.
You need to relax, man.

32:23.040 --> 32:26.032
Sorry. Relax.
- Chill.

32:51.560 --> 32:54.472
It's time to party.

32:56.080 --> 32:57.672
Nice shot.

33:05.480 --> 33:09.519
I picked up a sniper and took all three of
their heads off. Boom, straight away.

33:09.600 --> 33:12.637
It was incredible.
I'd never done that before.

33:12.800 --> 33:16.315
I ran into the pit,
and one picked up the over shield.

33:16.400 --> 33:20.552
And I jumped on his head three times.
Assassinated him. It was incredible.

33:20.640 --> 33:23.200
Hash cookie?
- No. They give me the shits.

33:23.280 --> 33:27.717
Up the lift, spin around, get the other in
the head. You're not listening, are you?

33:58.760 --> 34:01.513
Dude, gimme that cookie.

34:01.640 --> 34:05.269
I ate it.
- You ate the whole thing?

34:06.760 --> 34:10.833
Jesus, man, that's like
the equivalent of like 40 joints.

34:10.920 --> 34:13.070
You're gonna be so fucked up.

34:13.159 --> 34:16.755
You better hope Kate doesn't arrive
in the next hour. Seriously.

34:17.800 --> 34:19.233
Shit.

35:01.240 --> 35:06.394
Tom, are you OK?
- I can't. What?

35:06.480 --> 35:09.313
Kate's here, by the way.
- Where?

35:09.400 --> 35:10.469
She's coming now.

35:13.360 --> 35:15.669
Hey, guys.
- Hey.

35:17.920 --> 35:19.990
I have to go do stuff.

35:21.960 --> 35:25.236
Hi, Kate. I love your hair.
- Come on, Bulger. Let's dance.

35:26.640 --> 35:27.959
It's a great party.

35:31.120 --> 35:34.795
I ate a cookie.
- Tom, are you stoned?

35:35.560 --> 35:38.313
High? Me? No.

35:39.800 --> 35:45.318
Yeah. But you made it. That's great.
- I didn't know you knew so many people.

35:45.400 --> 35:49.678
Yeah. Thanks for coming.
- Fuck you.

35:49.760 --> 35:53.514
That's Jeff. Funny guy.

35:56.240 --> 35:58.390
I need some water.

36:02.560 --> 36:04.676
Oh, I missed you.

36:05.920 --> 36:10.436
Kate, I missed you, too.
- I meant with the drink.

36:31.680 --> 36:36.595
I can't stand him. He sits beside me
in English. He's such a fucking idiot.

36:36.680 --> 36:38.636
And that pubic beard.
He needs to shave.

36:38.720 --> 36:42.395
White socks with black shoes.
I don't fucking think so.

36:43.240 --> 36:45.629
It ain't '92, aye?

36:51.080 --> 36:53.116
Oh, man, look. Here she is.

36:53.240 --> 36:56.994
Oh, she's so fucking hot.
Look, look, look.

36:57.080 --> 36:59.435
Shake it, baby. Yeah. Shake it.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.836
Working it.
- She's gonna get it tonight.

37:01.920 --> 37:05.390
There's more a chance
of me going on a diet. Seriously.

37:06.240 --> 37:07.559
Things are about to get romantic.

37:07.640 --> 37:10.791
Vinny, you're as romantic
as a wank in Funderland.

37:10.880 --> 37:12.996
Lads, I need a wing man.

37:16.960 --> 37:18.234
Go.

37:19.880 --> 37:21.950
Hey.
- This is Tom. It's his party.

37:22.040 --> 37:24.315
Hey. Thanks for coming.
- Yeah, thanks.

37:28.040 --> 37:30.793
Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

37:32.960 --> 37:36.748
You want your picture taken?
Yeah, you do. Come on.

37:36.840 --> 37:41.550
Just a little over this way.
Ok? Yeah. Nice.

37:41.880 --> 37:44.030
He's taking her picture.
- I see.

37:44.640 --> 37:48.872
How are we?
- Hi, Dan. Thanks for coming.

37:48.960 --> 37:50.188
Wouldn't have missed this.

37:50.320 --> 37:53.790
Would not have missed it.
Nice decorations.

37:54.400 --> 37:58.951
Quite a little shindig you got here.
You pulled out all the stops, didn't you?

37:59.040 --> 38:00.917
Well done.
- Yeah.

38:02.160 --> 38:05.914
Look. There are some of
your friends over there.

38:08.560 --> 38:11.313
You want me to go?
- No, don't be silly.

38:11.400 --> 38:15.678
Yeah, Tom, don't be silly.
You don't have to go.

38:15.760 --> 38:19.548
Don't be silly.
- Fine.

38:56.760 --> 38:59.877
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!

39:16.520 --> 39:18.750
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!

39:20.640 --> 39:24.030
Look at the face on him.
- It's only Paul, you dope.

39:24.120 --> 39:27.032
I'm gonna kill you, Tommy boy.
- Cop on, you dick.

39:27.120 --> 39:28.439
Fuck off.

39:29.400 --> 39:30.833
Tom, are you OK?

39:34.000 --> 39:37.709
Nice one, guys.
- Not our fault he can't take a joke.

39:37.880 --> 39:41.236
I'll slap that smile off your face,
you knacker bitch.

39:41.360 --> 39:43.510
Fight! Fight! Fight!

39:57.320 --> 40:02.440
Oh babe, come over here. We'll have
a bit of a cat fight. OMG, little pussy.

40:02.520 --> 40:07.435
Babe, your just a pigeon in a tacky frock.
- Bitch, I don't wanna talk, poodle face.

40:07.520 --> 40:10.990
Babe, you're easier to get into than
community college, so leave.

40:11.080 --> 40:12.798
Fuck you.
- Fuck you, Sarah.

40:12.920 --> 40:15.115
Wait, the whole party already has.

40:15.200 --> 40:16.428
That's enough, Bulger.

40:16.520 --> 40:20.911
You and the prick just leave
because no one likes you.

40:21.720 --> 40:23.711
Where's the first aid kit?
- In the pantry.

40:23.800 --> 40:26.155
You have a pantry?
I'm on it.

40:32.440 --> 40:33.793
Tom!

40:39.720 --> 40:41.119
He went that way, love.

40:44.440 --> 40:49.275
Kate! Where did you put
that bottle of vodka?

40:49.360 --> 40:52.750
Is it in your bag? Kate?

40:54.520 --> 40:56.954
All right, I'll see you later.

41:19.040 --> 41:20.359
Bingo.

41:21.960 --> 41:23.234
My favourite.

41:30.320 --> 41:31.514
Are you OK?

41:45.360 --> 41:49.512
How's your head?
- It's fine.

41:53.880 --> 41:55.950
Remember we used to come up here?

41:57.280 --> 41:58.998
This is the crows nest.

42:01.240 --> 42:03.037
Do you still use it?

42:05.320 --> 42:08.710
Tom, what the fuck?
- What?

42:09.360 --> 42:12.670
Why is the telescope pointing at my house?

42:12.800 --> 42:14.153
Pervert.
- No.

42:14.240 --> 42:17.391
I was up here the other night
looking at the graveyard,

42:17.520 --> 42:19.556
and I saw your light come on.

42:19.680 --> 42:23.229
I turned the telescope around
and saw you in your room.

42:23.320 --> 42:29.077
You were a bit mad about something.

42:29.160 --> 42:34.188
You were wearing clothes anyway.
That's all I saw. I swear.

42:34.480 --> 42:39.110
Why were you looking at the graveyard
in the first place?

42:41.400 --> 42:45.996
Open up before I fucking piss
in clown pants. Fuck's sake!

42:46.080 --> 42:48.071
Go upstairs, you clown.
- Fuck you.

43:02.920 --> 43:09.359
I know how this sounds, but the night of
Stitches' funeral I went to the graveyard,

43:09.480 --> 43:13.268
and I saw this ancient ritual thing
in the clown crypt.

43:14.840 --> 43:16.034
It freaked me out.

43:18.240 --> 43:19.753
You think I'm nuts, don't you?

43:20.600 --> 43:24.388
No.
- Anyway, I'm not a peeping Tom.

43:27.480 --> 43:29.152
I'm just a mental Tom.

43:29.240 --> 43:33.472
You're not the only one who's screwed up.
All of us turned out odd.

43:53.640 --> 43:55.835
Where's the fucking zip?

43:59.480 --> 44:00.799
Not again.

44:13.480 --> 44:18.076
No one would believe me, so I started
researching everything on clowns.

44:18.160 --> 44:24.508
I thought if I found something out about
that ritual, I could prove it happened.

44:24.960 --> 44:29.511
Clowns have been around for centuries.
I've got stuff on Mediaeval jesters,

44:29.760 --> 44:33.992
Pueblo lndian Delight Makers, ancient
Egyptian rib tickling ceremonies,

44:34.080 --> 44:37.516
the Feast of Fools,
the right of Osseous Humours...

44:40.760 --> 44:45.276
I never found anything.
It was all in my head.

44:46.720 --> 44:48.119
What are these?

44:48.200 --> 44:52.193
When a person becomes a clown,
they have to paint their face on an egg.

44:52.960 --> 44:57.317
They call it the Spiritus Singularum,
the Uniqueness of Spirit.

44:57.560 --> 45:00.120
Nobody knows
where the tradition comes from.

45:00.200 --> 45:03.192
It's been around
for as long as the clowns have.

45:26.480 --> 45:28.357
Paul.

45:48.760 --> 45:54.153
He just can't compete. She's with you.
She feels sorry for him. That's all.

45:54.240 --> 45:55.992
Aw, tastes like piss.

46:01.240 --> 46:02.434
Is there any more?

46:04.160 --> 46:06.549
Up to your old tricks again, Paul?

46:08.600 --> 46:10.556
Who the fuck are you?

46:14.280 --> 46:17.352
Maybe this trick will jog your memory.

46:28.280 --> 46:29.315
My fucking ear!

46:44.160 --> 46:45.878
You're a lucky boy, Paul.

46:47.320 --> 46:51.518
You've got a front row seat
to my comeback show.

46:51.960 --> 46:55.111
Please. No. Please.

46:55.680 --> 46:57.318
That doesn't sound good.

46:58.840 --> 47:02.879
You must have a hair in your throat.
Allow me.

47:07.320 --> 47:12.997
Something. It wasn't a hair.
It was a little fluffy bunny.

47:17.320 --> 47:20.949
It was our fault he died.
- It wasn't.

47:21.040 --> 47:24.828
Just for the record,
not every party ends with a dead clown.

47:52.720 --> 47:56.349
This party is really kicking now.

47:57.360 --> 48:00.158
So, photography is your hobby, is it?

48:00.240 --> 48:05.155
Pretty much, kind of.
You get some good results.

48:05.240 --> 48:09.870
Let me see.
- I'm trying to see where the lads are.

48:11.400 --> 48:14.312
Great.
- OK.

48:16.480 --> 48:20.075
I really like this one. This one is...

48:20.160 --> 48:25.917
Yeah, that's of you.
It's a nice picture, I guess.

48:28.240 --> 48:30.435
Hey, Kate. Kate.

48:30.520 --> 48:33.239
Oh, excuse me.
What's your problem, pale face?

48:33.320 --> 48:36.437
My problem is you pulling that shit
with Tom, you ginger fuck.

48:36.600 --> 48:39.398
Fuck off. That boy needs to lighten up.

48:39.480 --> 48:42.119
How is pissy pants anyway?

48:42.200 --> 48:44.839
Up in his layer crying,
drying himself off?

48:44.960 --> 48:48.430
It was a joke. He needs to get over that.
- It wasn't a very funny joke.

48:48.520 --> 48:50.272
It was pretty hilarious.
I was laughing.

48:59.560 --> 49:02.438
Have you seen Paul floating around?
- Your asshole boyfriend?

49:02.520 --> 49:04.556
Oh.
- No.

49:04.640 --> 49:10.351
Kate. If you wanna get to me, you're gonna
have to do better than slag Paul.

49:10.440 --> 49:13.955
Speaking of boyfriends, what lead singer
are you sleeping with nowadays?

49:14.040 --> 49:16.349
Changes so often.
- Keeping tabs, are you?

49:16.440 --> 49:19.750
Well, it is difficult.
It's not a one man job.

49:19.840 --> 49:24.470
Speaking of jobs, I do hear you're
more partial to the old blow job.

49:24.560 --> 49:28.997
What? - How else would you acquire
the name 'Blow Job Kate'?

49:30.080 --> 49:31.354
Fuck!

49:39.480 --> 49:41.198
Sniff 'em out.

50:43.040 --> 50:44.359
Goodbye, Funny Bones.

50:47.640 --> 50:49.790
Look's like you've eaten too much, fatso.

50:51.560 --> 50:53.710
Paul, you dick.

50:53.800 --> 50:59.432
I'm not Paul.
He had to head off.

50:59.800 --> 51:03.509
Let's see if we can find
room in there for desert.

51:03.600 --> 51:04.635
Oh, Jesus.

51:23.800 --> 51:26.758
Help! Help!

51:43.640 --> 51:45.631
I'm being raped by a clown!

51:46.440 --> 51:47.634
Help!

53:16.280 --> 53:19.556
Now, that's food for thought.

53:29.760 --> 53:31.557
You feeling a bit peckish, fat boy?

53:35.480 --> 53:36.959
Do you want me to call someone?

53:38.640 --> 53:40.949
You're fucking disgusting.

54:36.000 --> 54:37.831
Paul!

54:39.040 --> 54:41.713
Ice cream and crisps,

54:41.840 --> 54:45.594
and people would say
I was fat all the time.

54:45.680 --> 54:48.069
Everything was just so...

54:51.960 --> 54:55.350
Anyway, tell me something about you.

54:55.440 --> 54:58.159
I can make a girl's nipples hard
without touching.

54:58.680 --> 55:01.069
Bet you five quid.
- What's going on here?

55:01.160 --> 55:03.799
He said he could make my nipples hard
without touching.

55:03.880 --> 55:06.314
He's not messing. I've seen him practise
on Bulger's moobs.

55:06.680 --> 55:08.750
OK, I need to concentrate.

55:16.680 --> 55:18.716
Vinny! Oh my God!
- Worth every penny.

55:25.920 --> 55:28.639
For fuck's sake, you little prick.

55:33.080 --> 55:34.832
Vinny.

55:44.040 --> 55:46.838
What a perfect pair, a dick and a cunt.

55:58.040 --> 56:00.156
Vinny, you dickhead.

56:26.040 --> 56:26.711
Paul?

56:34.880 --> 56:36.108
Paul?

56:45.040 --> 56:46.758
Paul, is that you?

56:52.120 --> 56:53.951
Are you trying to be funny?

56:54.040 --> 56:57.112
This clown's not funny.

56:58.440 --> 57:00.112
Not anymore.

57:16.600 --> 57:18.158
Pick up the phone, Vinny.

57:22.920 --> 57:25.957
Brace yourself. Here it comes.

57:46.760 --> 57:47.988
Bastard.

58:23.680 --> 58:26.399
Taken from behind.

58:52.040 --> 58:54.110
Sniff 'em out.

59:14.720 --> 59:18.952
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

59:24.840 --> 59:27.195
Guys, you need to get out
of here right now!

59:27.280 --> 59:31.637
There's a clown who died and he came back,
and he's in my house right now!

59:31.720 --> 59:33.915
You need to get out of here!

59:34.880 --> 59:36.598
Clown?
- You're a fucking clown.

59:36.720 --> 59:38.915
I'm not joking.
We need to go right now.

59:39.000 --> 59:42.072
Oh my God, you are being serious.
- Piss off.

59:46.000 --> 59:47.319
Vinny!
- Vinny!

59:47.400 --> 59:50.233
Vinny, I love you.
- Tom, what the fuck?

59:50.320 --> 59:53.198
You need to get out of the house now!
- What are you talking about?

59:53.280 --> 59:57.068
The clown's back. Get everyone together.
Get dressed and get out of there.

59:57.160 --> 01:00:00.675
Calm down. It's OK.
I'll be out in about five minutes.

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:03.752
It's not safe, Vinny.
We have to go right now!

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.516
Shut up for a second, please.
- Six minutes.

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:09.308
He's ready for you, Vinny.
- Listen to me!

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:11.356
Go for it.
- I need you, man.

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:17.154
You're in there.
He's ready for you, Vinny.

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:20.073
He says he'll give you a hand job
for a fiver.

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:24.631
Vinny!
- Just tell him you love him.

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:35.510
Let's see how many lives you've got left.

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:38.399
One, two, three,

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:41.517
four, five, six,

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:44.712
seven, eight, nine.

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.071
Dead.

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.519
Kate. It's Stitches.
- What are you talking about?

01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.835
The clown from my party, he's back.
- That clown died at your party.

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:02.115
No, serious.
- Tom, it's Paul dressed up.

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:04.873
It's not Paul. I know what I saw.
Come on.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.076
Paul, no.
- Fuck off.

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:17.478
Guys, there's a killer in the house!

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:20.870
Vinny's upstairs. He needs our help.
- Help him get it up.

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:24.795
Has anyone seen Paul, Richie or Bulger?

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:34.475
So do you wanna go upstairs?
- No. I don't want to encourage this shit.

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:38.758
No, I mean do you want to go upstairs?

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.118
Don't worry about her, man. She doesn't
know a winner when she sees one.

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:47.269
Chicks.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.149
Vinny?

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.395
Prick.

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:01.437
We have to go now.

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:23.037
Vinny, the clown is back.
If you don't come now, he could kill us.

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:34.431
We need to get out of here.
- I'm trying to bang this chick.

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:36.670
Vinny, tell the little prick to piss off!

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:40.795
You don't look happy to see me.
I know what'll cheer you up.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:01.315
I saw him upstairs. You have to come now.
- Vinny. Vinny.

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:03.510
I'll be back in two minutes.

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:13.320
Can you tell what it is yet?

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:16.829
Woof. Woof.

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:23.598
Dickhead.

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:29.159
Say cheese. Oh, that's not my best side.

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:58.716
What's happening to me?
- Stop talking, big head.

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:34.479
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:36.073
Put your knickers on. We're leaving.

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:39.351
Vinny. Vinny.

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:41.556
Mary, come on.
There's a killer clown in the house.

01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:45.519
Is there? I'd like to meet him.
Sounds like a fun guy.

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:55.157
You are 16, right?
I don't want to go to prison.

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:03.193
Long time no see.

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:09.230
Bastard!
- Step on his head!

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:15.711
Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:22.070
Vinny, I'm not leaving here
without Kate and the others.

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:45.160
Here, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.
Here, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:50.030
Where are you?
Right, where are you?

01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:53.317
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:59.512
Here, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.
Here, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:06.278
Come on.
- No.

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.510
Toughen up.
- No.

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:15.916
Here, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.
Here, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:21.717
Here, Tommy, Tommy.
Here, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:27.636
We'll be OK in the crowd. He's not going
to attack us in front of everyone.

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:32.278
OK? OK.

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:44.194
Where do you think you're going?
- Get out of my way, you wanker.

01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:51.158
You're so fucking sued.
My dad's a lawyer!

01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:59.236
Richie!

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:03.631
Richie!

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:10.397
Richie!

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:24.115
Oh my God!

01:08:24.359 --> 01:08:28.148
Why you screaming, chunky?
You clearly got the stomach for it.

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:47.678
Everybody happy?

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.991
We have to go.

01:09:01.439 --> 01:09:03.908
Blow Job Kate, get your mouth around this.

01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:11.988
Vinny, Kate.
Kate.

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:17.832
Kate, wake up.
- Kiss her, Tom. Now's your chance.

01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:19.553
Kate!

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:22.993
Come on!

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.556
Deja-motherfucking-vu.

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:32.955
Where do you think you're going?

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:47.272
Where are we going?
- To the graveyard.

01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:50.432
Stitches' egg. If we can find it
and break it, I think we can kill him.

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:09.795
You little bastard.

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:26.391
Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.398
Come on. Hurry up.

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:29.837
I can't stop it.

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:37.997
Where are you?

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:52.917
Where are you?

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.313
Let's go.

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:13.633
OK. One of us needs to stand guard.

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:16.320
Inside, you'll see big shelves
with hundreds of eggs on them.

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:18.510
Tom...
- Stitches' egg has his face on it.

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:22.189
Tom, I don't know what's there. Just go.
- Yes.

01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:24.840
Looks like there's a party at my house.

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:50.948
Where are you?

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:39.429
Tom, righty tighty, lefty loosey.

01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:57.038
Happy birthday, Tommy.

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:01.395
It's time to cut the cake.

01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:05.353
Now which is funnier...

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:09.228
the look on your face watching her die...

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:14.030
or the look on her face watching you die?

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:19.349
How about we flip a coin?

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:23.197
Heads it's me. Tails it's her.

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:26.118
That's really sick, Tom.

01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:28.430
I like it.

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:07.437
Well, fuck me sideways.

01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:14.198
I never thought I'd end up
with egg on my face.

01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:25.513
What is it?
- Open it. It's a moving house gift.

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:28.990
We're only moving down the road.
- Just open it.

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:37.438
You'll need a stronger lens
if you wanna keep an eye on me.

01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:41.195
Not that you're in to that sort of thing.
- Yeah.

01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:04.112
Steady.

01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:14.748
Steady.

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:26.115
Yes. Yes.

01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:36.514
Everybody happy?
