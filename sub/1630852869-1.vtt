WEBVTT

00:40.445 --> 00:41.480
No, no, no!

00:48.120 --> 00:50.655
<i>No, no, it's...
it's not gonna work.</i>

00:50.688 --> 00:53.324
How do you know that?
We've not even tried it.

00:53.357 --> 00:56.027
<i>Because you're
just, you're just saying that</i>

00:56.060 --> 00:57.427
<i>for the sake of fixing this.</i>

00:57.460 --> 01:00.264
<i>This...</i>
<i>Whatever this is.</i>

01:00.298 --> 01:02.800
Whatever this is? Wow.

01:02.834 --> 01:05.303
<i>Well, it's,
it's not really a relationship, Grace,</i>

01:05.334 --> 01:08.370
<i>when I'm the only one
making the effort, is it?</i>

01:08.404 --> 01:10.639
<i>I mean...</i>
<i>I had to call you, like,</i>

01:10.673 --> 01:12.776
<i>three times this week
just to get through to you.</i>

01:12.809 --> 01:14.376
How many times do
I have to tell you...

01:14.410 --> 01:16.412
<i>You're busy doing the work.
Yeah, I know, I know.</i>

01:16.445 --> 01:18.981
<i>But, you know, what's...
what's wrong with texting?</i>

01:19.014 --> 01:20.182
<i>You know, you could
at least text me.</i>

01:20.216 --> 01:21.549
<i>This, this entire month,</i>

01:21.583 --> 01:24.019
<i>I felt like you,
you didn't even exist.</i>

01:24.485 --> 01:25.788
I warned you.

01:25.821 --> 01:28.224
I warned you at the beginning
that this wasn't gonna be easy

01:28.257 --> 01:29.757
because of the long distance.

01:29.792 --> 01:31.960
<i>And you know what?
I guess I was wrong,</i>

01:31.993 --> 01:34.128
<i>because I thought that
we would be okay</i>

01:34.162 --> 01:36.064
<i>without the physical part.</i>

01:36.097 --> 01:38.565
Oh. So it's a physical
thing now?

01:39.666 --> 01:42.468
<i>No, no, it's everything, Grace.</i>

01:42.501 --> 01:45.471
<i>It's everything.
You just... You don't get it.</i>

01:45.504 --> 01:46.807
No, I get it.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.141
You haven't had sex
for a few months,

01:48.175 --> 01:50.344
and now everything's
falling apart.

01:50.376 --> 01:52.678
<i>You're starting to sound
delusional. You know that?</i>

01:52.712 --> 01:54.479
Okay, then help me.

01:54.512 --> 01:56.615
Help me to see a future
in this relationship.

01:58.617 --> 02:01.187
I seriously... I don't even
know why we're arguing.

02:04.623 --> 02:06.324
<i>Because, Grace,</i>

02:06.358 --> 02:10.494
<i>I am trying my absolute hardest</i>

02:10.526 --> 02:12.730
<i>not to break up
with you right now.</i>

02:15.733 --> 02:17.202
Okay.

02:17.235 --> 02:20.503
<i>I am trying.
I really, really am.</i>

02:20.536 --> 02:21.671
<i>But you know what?</i>

02:21.704 --> 02:25.209
<i>At the end of the day,
I don't get to see you.</i>

02:25.242 --> 02:27.677
<i>We never speak to each other.</i>

02:27.710 --> 02:28.745
<i>What's the point?</i>

02:30.412 --> 02:31.281
Love.

02:33.917 --> 02:36.252
<i>Love. Sure.</i>

02:37.220 --> 02:38.587
<i>Do you love me, Grace?</i>

02:41.057 --> 02:42.090
I do.

02:44.159 --> 02:45.294
<i>I do too, you know.</i>

02:45.327 --> 02:49.031
<i>But...</i>
<i>That's the problem.</i>

02:49.064 --> 02:51.565
- What?
- <i>We're not in love anymore, Grace.</i>

02:51.967 --> 02:53.101
<i>Are we?</i>

02:57.071 --> 02:58.105
I don't know.

02:58.773 --> 03:00.141
<i>I can't do this.</i>

03:01.708 --> 03:03.144
Hmm. Chris...

03:03.878 --> 03:05.046
Chris...

03:05.079 --> 03:07.380
<i>You either... You
either fly over tomorrow</i>

03:07.414 --> 03:11.583
<i>or this relationship,
it's over for me.</i>

03:12.751 --> 03:14.453
That's not fair.

03:14.486 --> 03:16.323
You have to give me
more time.

03:19.091 --> 03:20.259
<i>Goodbye, Grace.</i>

03:21.526 --> 03:22.460
<i>Have a nice life.</i>

06:06.743 --> 06:07.579
Oi!

06:14.152 --> 06:15.587
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

06:15.619 --> 06:16.720
I'm sorry.

06:16.754 --> 06:18.654
- You just nearly ran me over.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

06:18.688 --> 06:20.524
- I'm sorry.
- Oh. You were on your phone, were ya?

06:20.557 --> 06:21.925
Look, I'm distracted.

06:21.959 --> 06:23.327
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm sorry. I know.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.028
- You're all right?
- Keep your eyes on the road. Yeah?

06:25.062 --> 06:26.263
You fucking idiot.

06:27.064 --> 06:29.299
Oh, fuck.

06:43.912 --> 06:45.847
Come on, come on.
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

08:48.059 --> 08:50.528
Hey. David, right?

08:50.562 --> 08:51.763
Hello, Grace.

08:53.398 --> 08:54.733
Do you know
if anyone's in?

08:55.734 --> 08:59.203
I saw Ed and Liv
walk the dog this morning.

08:59.236 --> 09:00.638
Oh. Really?

09:04.942 --> 09:05.942
It's bad.

09:10.280 --> 09:11.681
What's bad, David?

09:37.773 --> 09:38.673
Hello?

10:12.170 --> 10:13.104
Hello?

10:14.639 --> 10:16.674
Ed?

11:09.222 --> 11:10.156
Anyone in?

11:15.695 --> 11:18.130
Oh, hey, Polly, little cutie.

11:37.381 --> 11:39.150
Hello?

11:39.183 --> 11:41.285
Grace? Is that you?

11:42.252 --> 11:44.020
- Yeah.
- I'll be right down.

11:44.587 --> 11:45.622
Okay.

11:57.767 --> 11:58.735
Hey.

12:11.446 --> 12:13.581
- Surprise!
- Gracie.

12:13.614 --> 12:15.950
Oh, my God,
it's been such a long time.

12:19.754 --> 12:21.254
Wait. It's Ed's birthday, right?

12:21.288 --> 12:22.222
Oh, have I got the date wrong?

12:22.255 --> 12:23.590
No. Yeah. Yeah, it is.

12:23.623 --> 12:25.760
Babe, look who's here.

12:25.793 --> 12:27.961
Oh, Barbara, you don't have
to iron those. I'll do them.

12:28.763 --> 12:29.930
It's nearly done anyway.

12:30.496 --> 12:31.832
I said I'll do them.

12:32.933 --> 12:33.800
Okay.

12:35.634 --> 12:37.303
Well, I'm off then.

12:37.336 --> 12:39.806
- Have a good weekend.
- Yeah, see ya.

12:44.844 --> 12:48.112
Grace, what are you doing here?

12:48.146 --> 12:50.415
To celebrate your
birthday obviously.

12:50.448 --> 12:53.218
Oh, you know, I don't really
like to celebrate my birthdays.

12:53.250 --> 12:54.518
Oh. Shut up.

12:54.551 --> 12:56.153
It's a good excuse
to get drunk at least.

12:58.989 --> 13:00.023
Tea?

13:00.057 --> 13:01.024
Yeah, sure.

13:09.699 --> 13:11.802
So how did you know
I was gonna be here?

13:11.835 --> 13:13.302
Where else are you gonna be?

13:13.336 --> 13:15.004
You two are practically married.

13:15.037 --> 13:18.975
Oh, now you're here
we might as well have a party.

13:19.007 --> 13:20.943
Just like the old times, eh?

13:20.977 --> 13:22.644
Well, you better watch out
for this one then.

13:22.677 --> 13:24.179
You know what she's like
when she's had a few.

13:24.814 --> 13:26.448
I'll be on my best behavior.

13:26.481 --> 13:28.216
We'll see about that.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.152
Do you guys know
what's up with David?

13:32.686 --> 13:34.154
What do you mean?

13:34.188 --> 13:36.023
He said something
weird to me earlier.

13:37.424 --> 13:39.460
Oh. You know he's a weirdo.

13:39.493 --> 13:40.996
Yeah. I saw him the other day.

13:41.028 --> 13:43.663
He was eating flowers
and he just kept chewing them.

13:43.696 --> 13:45.431
Hmm.

13:45.465 --> 13:48.701
Do you know what I think?
I think he's got a great life.

13:48.736 --> 13:51.005
I mean, he doesn't work,

13:51.037 --> 13:53.106
gets benefits from the
government and he lives with mum.

13:53.572 --> 13:55.040
Scot-free.

13:55.073 --> 13:58.210
Oh, and what? We live such
a miserable life, do we?

13:59.746 --> 14:02.782
I mean, you're not doing
too bad yourself, Ed.

14:03.348 --> 14:05.216
Look at this place.

14:05.249 --> 14:08.686
And a beautiful girlfriend
who you stole away from me.

14:08.720 --> 14:10.354
You can take Polly
with you anytime.

14:10.388 --> 14:11.355
Hey.

14:12.223 --> 14:13.057
Here.

14:14.592 --> 14:17.427
To make your life
even worse, Ed.

14:19.529 --> 14:20.497
I got you something.

14:22.432 --> 14:23.400
You shouldn't have.

14:25.201 --> 14:26.369
Come on, open it.

14:45.587 --> 14:46.421
Wow.

14:48.423 --> 14:49.424
You know you're getting old

14:49.457 --> 14:50.960
when you start getting
cigars for your birthday.

14:52.928 --> 14:55.562
God. They smell expensive, babe.

14:55.596 --> 14:58.565
Apparently, they're the exact
same brand that was used

14:58.599 --> 15:00.500
during Bill Clinton's
presidency.

15:01.168 --> 15:02.070
Really?

15:04.772 --> 15:05.939
No way.

15:08.474 --> 15:09.408
Thanks.

15:09.943 --> 15:12.111
Welcome. Happy birthday.

15:16.783 --> 15:18.383
Will you be staying tonight?

15:18.416 --> 15:19.919
Nah, I don't wanna intrude.

15:19.952 --> 15:23.089
Uh, we're going to see
my family, remember?

15:23.121 --> 15:25.256
- Oh.
- I don't remember.

15:25.290 --> 15:26.959
Yeah, we spoke
about it last week.

15:27.960 --> 15:30.461
Well, plans can change.
Can't they, babe?

15:30.494 --> 15:32.296
- I mean...
- Oh, you're staying.

15:38.535 --> 15:39.536
So how's your new job?

15:40.371 --> 15:41.270
Oh, you got a new job?

15:41.304 --> 15:43.573
Yeah. It's not exactly
new anymore.

15:43.606 --> 15:45.608
Something to do
with toxicology.

15:45.642 --> 15:47.111
Forensic scientist.

15:48.311 --> 15:50.546
Interesting choice
for a girl, isn't it?

15:50.580 --> 15:52.582
- Not really.
- Just asking.

15:52.615 --> 15:54.249
Actually, I'm just a junior.

15:54.282 --> 15:56.618
You know,
I find it so fascinating.

15:56.652 --> 15:59.621
You must have witnessed
some horrendous crime scenes.

15:59.655 --> 16:03.458
Not all forensic scientists get
involved in crime scene work.

16:03.492 --> 16:05.093
Some choose to stay in the lab.

16:06.460 --> 16:07.829
Babe, I just realized.

16:08.529 --> 16:10.098
You're a lawyer,

16:10.132 --> 16:12.968
so the two of you could
work together on a case.

16:14.936 --> 16:16.138
I suppose we could.

16:16.838 --> 16:18.806
Maybe we already have.

16:18.839 --> 16:21.776
I mean, obviously,
we can't talk about it.

16:21.809 --> 16:24.644
It's all confidential,
legally binding.

16:29.849 --> 16:32.018
Right. I was just
prepping dinner.

16:32.052 --> 16:33.686
Are you hungry, Grace?

16:33.720 --> 16:34.954
You know I can always eat.

16:34.988 --> 16:37.057
Great. I'll let
you two catch up.

16:40.927 --> 16:42.260
Give me a kiss, babe.

16:50.501 --> 16:51.737
Oh.

16:51.770 --> 16:53.771
How many hugs
do you want off me?

16:53.805 --> 16:55.873
Oh. I've just missed
you so much.

16:55.907 --> 16:57.507
So, how's you and Chris?

16:57.541 --> 16:58.876
Yeah. We're fine.

16:58.910 --> 17:00.144
- Good.
- Hm.

17:59.297 --> 18:01.134
So, how long
has he been away?

18:04.203 --> 18:06.138
- Three months...
- Months?

18:23.888 --> 18:25.089
Hey, Lucas.

18:26.223 --> 18:28.225
<i>Ed, happy birthday, man.</i>

18:28.591 --> 18:29.491
Thanks.

18:30.927 --> 18:33.129
<i>Remember, you're only
as old as the woman you feel.</i>

18:36.498 --> 18:39.135
<i>Are you
ready to come back to work yet?</i>

18:40.170 --> 18:43.337
Yeah, soon. Soon.

18:44.338 --> 18:47.341
How is the Cardona case going?

18:50.746 --> 18:53.981
<i>Well, all the signs
are there, but the police</i>

18:54.015 --> 18:58.085
<i>are blind as bats and the public
are all swayed by the celebrity.</i>

18:58.119 --> 18:59.954
<i>You know, same old drill.</i>

18:59.987 --> 19:01.989
<i>I'm doing
the best I can.</i>

19:02.023 --> 19:03.590
<i>But I ain't no Edward Newman.</i>

19:04.424 --> 19:06.492
<i>Anyway,
trial starts next week.</i>

19:07.493 --> 19:08.360
That soon?

19:10.130 --> 19:13.700
<i>Yeah, look, don't feel
like you need to rush back.</i>

19:14.701 --> 19:15.802
<i>You and Liv okay?</i>

19:17.803 --> 19:18.670
<i>Ed?</i>

19:20.940 --> 19:23.175
- <i>Ed?</i>
- Uh, yeah.

19:23.209 --> 19:25.643
Yeah. Look, I'll give you a call
before the trial starts.

19:28.646 --> 19:31.216
<i>Yeah, okay. Sure, man.</i>

19:35.086 --> 19:38.890
<i>Yeah, I guess so.
But how about you in the countryside?</i>

19:38.923 --> 19:40.624
Oh. Great.

19:40.657 --> 19:42.358
We went hiking last weekend.

19:42.391 --> 19:44.728
Oh, my gosh. You would
not believe the view

19:44.761 --> 19:46.864
from the top of the mountain.

19:46.897 --> 19:49.800
I can get my phone and show
you some of the pictures.

19:49.833 --> 19:51.134
Okay.

20:35.440 --> 20:36.943
Ed?

21:06.002 --> 21:07.404
Grace, get in.

21:14.744 --> 21:16.713
I think it's time
for Grace to meet Polly.

21:16.745 --> 21:18.681
- Yes.
- Who's Polly?

21:18.714 --> 21:20.481
Polly, come on, girl.

21:20.515 --> 21:23.085
Oh, my God. You have a dog.

21:23.118 --> 21:24.753
She's so cute.

21:24.787 --> 21:28.357
Isn't she just? Didn't you say
she was adopted, though?

21:28.390 --> 21:29.589
Yeah, well, family dog.

21:29.623 --> 21:31.292
Mom got her
from a rescue center.

21:31.326 --> 21:32.894
She works long hours now
and couldn't take care of her.

21:32.927 --> 21:35.997
So, she dropped her off here
and she's been here ever since.

21:36.030 --> 21:37.231
Check this.

21:41.567 --> 21:42.736
Aw.

21:43.904 --> 21:46.273
So, how did you two meet?

21:46.306 --> 21:47.774
She didn't tell you?

21:47.808 --> 21:49.843
I thought that's the first thing
you girls would talk about.

21:49.876 --> 21:51.577
I was too embarrassed to say.

21:51.610 --> 21:52.812
Why?

21:52.845 --> 21:55.014
- Swipe, swipe, swipe.
- Ed.

21:55.047 --> 21:56.716
How very old-fashioned of you.

21:56.749 --> 21:58.417
Hey, look,
dating apps are great.

21:58.451 --> 22:00.319
Don't knock them off. I've got friends
who got married from them, you know.

22:00.353 --> 22:01.586
Can't say I've ever used them.

22:01.619 --> 22:02.989
Well, maybe you
should give it a go.

22:03.022 --> 22:04.622
Once you get past all the
dick pics and the hook-ups...

22:04.656 --> 22:06.925
What he's trying to say
is that nice guys like him

22:06.958 --> 22:07.859
are hard to find.

22:08.193 --> 22:09.094
Right.

22:09.127 --> 22:10.996
So, who messaged first?

22:11.029 --> 22:12.764
- I did.
- Pretty sure it was me.

22:12.797 --> 22:14.366
Um, I sent a smiley face.

22:14.399 --> 22:16.667
You sent a winky emoji
and they don't count.

22:16.700 --> 22:19.303
Anyway, he was telling me
about this book he was reading.

22:19.336 --> 22:22.139
Something like Anna, Anna Karen?

22:22.172 --> 22:23.707
- <i>Anna Karenina.</i>
- Yeah. That's it.

22:23.741 --> 22:24.908
Oh. I love that book.

22:24.942 --> 22:27.711
Wasn't it written by a Russian
author, uh, Tolstoy?

22:28.212 --> 22:30.146
Yeah. Leo Tolstoy.

22:30.179 --> 22:31.247
Well, I had no idea.

22:31.280 --> 22:32.915
So I just said, "Cool."

22:32.949 --> 22:35.184
And he kept showing off.
And then I just thought,

22:35.218 --> 22:37.220
"Mmm, this guy's
just not for me."

22:37.253 --> 22:41.356
- You got bored of him?
- Yes, but he kept on going.

22:41.390 --> 22:44.326
And then, well,
I started to realize

22:44.359 --> 22:46.261
there's something
quite appealing about him.

22:46.795 --> 22:47.863
And I asked her out.

22:47.896 --> 22:49.197
I said no at first.

22:49.231 --> 22:51.532
Uh, she was playing
hard to get, you know.

22:51.565 --> 22:53.501
But eventually he started

22:53.533 --> 22:56.003
to make me laugh
and being all charming.

22:56.037 --> 22:57.705
So we met and here we are.

22:59.206 --> 23:00.841
Come on, let me
show you to your room.

23:07.914 --> 23:09.916
Hello? Grace!

23:11.317 --> 23:12.986
- Yeah.
- Hiking photos.

23:14.921 --> 23:17.823
You picked up the chair
and just threw her out the window?

23:24.196 --> 23:25.497
It's so crazy, right?

23:25.531 --> 23:28.167
I can't believe
he didn't get fired for that.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.467
Are you still
horse riding, Grace?

23:30.600 --> 23:33.371
Oh, babe, you used
to really enjoy that, no?

23:34.305 --> 23:37.708
Yeah, I just, uh,
I couldn't afford it.

23:37.742 --> 23:39.377
Since I moved into my own flat.

23:39.410 --> 23:41.445
Oh, that's a shame.

23:41.478 --> 23:43.213
Can you keep
the horse in the flat?

23:43.246 --> 23:44.881
Ed, stop being silly.

23:45.982 --> 23:49.386
I mean, plus, I felt
really bad for the horses.

23:50.387 --> 23:51.688
What do you mean?

23:51.721 --> 23:57.493
Well, before we came along,
they were wild and free

23:57.526 --> 23:59.528
and then look
what we made them do.

23:59.562 --> 24:02.098
And they get whipped around
by all these jockeys.

24:02.131 --> 24:05.733
What if we were put on this
planet to be their riders?

24:06.334 --> 24:07.836
Maybe that's their purpose.

24:07.869 --> 24:08.736
Okay.

24:08.770 --> 24:10.538
They might even like it
for all we know.

24:10.572 --> 24:15.110
Okay, Ed, let me...
Let me set the scene for you.

24:17.778 --> 24:19.813
So...

24:19.847 --> 24:23.684
So you're in the middle
of this... this huge field,

24:24.585 --> 24:28.422
and... and you walk
a few meters ahead.

24:28.455 --> 24:30.123
And then there's this...

24:30.156 --> 24:32.658
this wooden fence
in front of you.

24:33.326 --> 24:35.561
And then you look behind you

24:35.595 --> 24:38.865
and to the sides of you,
and there's nowhere to go.

24:39.832 --> 24:41.066
You're trapped.

24:42.267 --> 24:43.568
So...

24:44.236 --> 24:46.671
So you get down on all fours,

24:48.173 --> 24:51.576
and then I get on your back
and start smacking you about.

24:53.711 --> 24:56.680
That's exactly my point.
I might enjoy that.

24:57.948 --> 24:59.617
Enjoy what?

24:59.649 --> 25:00.985
The fencing or the smacking?

25:01.018 --> 25:03.521
Well, I think we all know
which one he enjoys more.

25:07.423 --> 25:08.858
All I'm saying

25:08.892 --> 25:11.461
is that the horses aren't
suffering like you think they are.

25:13.263 --> 25:14.931
And the whipping
just helps them to focus.

25:21.403 --> 25:23.639
No, but look,
here's the thing, right?

25:23.672 --> 25:25.607
A guy is interested
in the girl

25:25.641 --> 25:28.076
because he finds her attractive.

25:28.110 --> 25:33.381
So then he forces himself through all
the bullshit and gets her into bed.

25:33.414 --> 25:36.817
But then he realizes the sex
isn't what he visualized

25:36.851 --> 25:39.253
from all the porn
he's been watching all his life.

25:39.287 --> 25:42.088
Oh, my God, that's horrible.

25:43.156 --> 25:44.491
Well, on the flip side,

25:44.524 --> 25:47.027
the girl was looking for that
romantic, magical feeling

25:47.060 --> 25:48.795
that she's seen in
all the Hollywood movies

25:48.828 --> 25:50.665
that they've been
pumping out for decades.

25:51.631 --> 25:53.065
But it's just not there.

25:54.333 --> 25:56.168
Because in the real world,

25:56.202 --> 25:57.703
if a guy were to act like a...

25:57.736 --> 26:00.272
the male protagonist
from a rom-com,

26:00.306 --> 26:02.274
she'd lose interest really fast

26:02.308 --> 26:04.176
and find him creepy
and needy.

26:10.582 --> 26:12.917
Real romance requires
a real connection.

26:15.053 --> 26:16.154
Real bond.

26:18.755 --> 26:21.558
That comes from
real life events.

26:22.326 --> 26:23.695
It can't be forced.

26:24.861 --> 26:27.864
It just comes from personalities

26:27.898 --> 26:31.534
crossing paths and fitting
together at the right time.

26:35.304 --> 26:38.074
That's why so many people are
cheating while in marriages...

26:40.276 --> 26:41.810
'cause it's all fake.

26:46.181 --> 26:48.550
So I guess we shouldn't
be getting married then.

26:54.855 --> 26:57.524
So how long have you
been together now?

26:57.558 --> 26:59.326
Uh, about ten months, right?

26:59.360 --> 27:00.461
Eleven months.

27:00.494 --> 27:01.629
Yeah.

27:02.429 --> 27:04.698
Eleven months and two days.

27:04.732 --> 27:09.168
But this hottie right here
is my true love since school.

27:11.271 --> 27:14.642
Speaking of which, have you...

27:14.675 --> 27:17.677
Have you told him about
your secret lesbian experience?

27:17.710 --> 27:20.545
Oh, I've definitely
not heard this one.

27:20.579 --> 27:22.314
Thanks, Grace.

27:22.347 --> 27:24.216
It's not a secret anymore,
is it?

27:27.986 --> 27:31.122
Well, are you gonna
tell him, or should I?

27:31.155 --> 27:32.556
All right, all right.

27:33.024 --> 27:35.259
It's my story, so...

27:35.293 --> 27:36.762
I'll tell it.

27:38.929 --> 27:40.031
So...

27:43.600 --> 27:45.068
Okay, okay.

27:46.202 --> 27:48.505
I'd just broken up with Tom,

27:48.538 --> 27:50.907
because he was
a total asshole, right?

27:51.574 --> 27:53.108
And I decided

27:53.142 --> 27:57.146
that I needed to take
a break from dating.

27:57.179 --> 28:02.786
Then, when I finally
wanted to get back to it,

28:02.818 --> 28:06.187
I decided that I wanted
to date a woman.

28:06.220 --> 28:09.590
You know, the self-pleasuring
thing had become boring.

28:10.491 --> 28:12.460
So...

28:12.493 --> 28:15.731
I paid a visit
to my local gay bar.

28:15.764 --> 28:17.431
Oh, that's the best place
to pick out women

28:17.464 --> 28:18.733
- for me too...
- Shush!

28:18.766 --> 28:19.701
Ed.

28:21.134 --> 28:23.003
Do you want to hear
the story or not?

28:27.574 --> 28:29.041
Anyway,

28:30.744 --> 28:34.413
I was so turned on that night

28:34.447 --> 28:36.916
and I met
the most beautiful woman,

28:37.818 --> 28:41.953
and after some drinks
and flirting,

28:41.986 --> 28:44.322
we decided to go back
to her place.

28:47.125 --> 28:50.929
And then when we finally got
there, we move to the bedroom.

28:50.962 --> 28:52.296
We...

28:52.329 --> 28:55.800
We were just ripping each other's
clothes off without hesitation.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.337
And then we...

29:00.371 --> 29:04.141
We launch into what can
only be described as...

29:05.575 --> 29:08.378
hot animalistic sex.

29:09.112 --> 29:10.781
Everything was perfect...

29:13.616 --> 29:15.853
Then, she says,

29:15.885 --> 29:18.220
"Wait here,
I'll be right back."

29:18.253 --> 29:20.088
Oh!

29:20.122 --> 29:22.357
She comes back
wearing a strap-on.

29:23.625 --> 29:25.927
- A strap on?
- Yes.

29:25.961 --> 29:28.830
Of which I am to be
the recipient.

29:28.864 --> 29:32.933
I mean, I'm not opposed
to strap-ons, but...

29:32.967 --> 29:37.171
well, I was in
a man hating-mode, right?

29:37.204 --> 29:41.074
And I decided
that I wanted to come back

29:41.107 --> 29:43.778
to the touch and feel
of a woman.

29:45.178 --> 29:47.447
Not dangly bits.

29:47.480 --> 29:50.350
But being
the team player I am, I...

29:51.551 --> 29:53.653
I powered through.

29:55.789 --> 29:59.158
Then she climbs off me,

30:00.225 --> 30:02.494
she straddles my face.

30:02.528 --> 30:04.262
And she starts
jerking herself off.

30:05.396 --> 30:06.799
Yeah.

30:06.832 --> 30:10.368
Saying to me in not so many
words that I'm about to get it.

30:10.401 --> 30:14.939
So I'm thinking, "Wow,
this chick is really into

30:14.972 --> 30:17.140
"the whole
role-playing experience."

30:21.211 --> 30:24.916
When all of a sudden,
my entire face,

30:24.948 --> 30:27.484
neck, and chest gets covered...

30:27.517 --> 30:29.084
Covered in what?

30:30.887 --> 30:33.890
It was a fucking
squirting strap-on.

30:33.924 --> 30:35.458
Yeah.

30:35.491 --> 30:38.829
I looked like the cheerleader who'd
taken it from the entire football team.

30:38.862 --> 30:41.296
I mean, what the fuck?

30:41.329 --> 30:43.866
You're telling me they've got
a strap-on that can squirt?

30:43.899 --> 30:46.267
Anyway...

30:46.301 --> 30:48.804
Strap-on cum is easier
to wash off than real cum.

30:48.838 --> 30:50.305
Even from your hair.

30:52.306 --> 30:54.742
Then I got my snuggle,

30:55.409 --> 30:57.879
and, well, I left and...

30:58.545 --> 31:00.347
I haven't seen her since.

31:04.785 --> 31:06.753
At least it can't
get you pregnant.

31:16.095 --> 31:18.997
Thanks for reminding me
I'm fucking infertile, Grace.

31:23.568 --> 31:24.804
Liv, you're drunk.
She didn't mean...

31:24.837 --> 31:26.338
Whose side are you on, Ed?

31:27.572 --> 31:28.506
Wait...

31:43.787 --> 31:45.488
Grace, I made your
favorite honey cheesecake.

31:45.522 --> 31:46.556
Aww.

31:46.589 --> 31:48.893
That's sweet.
Thanks, Ed.

31:50.059 --> 31:54.229
So Liv tells me that you're
moving down to London.

31:55.130 --> 31:56.031
Yep.

31:56.064 --> 31:58.935
Trying to get
out of my comfort zone.

31:58.968 --> 32:01.470
Don't you dare
forget to visit me.

32:01.503 --> 32:03.438
Well, that depends.

32:03.472 --> 32:04.438
On?

32:04.472 --> 32:07.843
On whether I meet
a charming and handsome man.

32:08.543 --> 32:09.912
Someone like Ed.

32:12.413 --> 32:14.582
No, I think I can do better.

32:14.615 --> 32:16.383
Hmm. Yeah, you probably can.

32:17.384 --> 32:18.853
I wouldn't date me either.

32:18.886 --> 32:20.021
- Mm-mm.
- No.

32:20.053 --> 32:22.556
Got some terrible habits,
haven't I?

32:22.589 --> 32:25.325
Yeah, many.
You don't want to know.

32:25.358 --> 32:26.526
Like?

32:26.560 --> 32:30.563
Well, I do
too much ironing, um...

35:29.761 --> 35:30.695
Hello?

35:35.967 --> 35:37.135
Who's there?

35:53.448 --> 35:55.283
I see you're enjoying
the cigar then.

35:57.285 --> 35:58.221
Yeah.

36:06.594 --> 36:08.063
I'm sorry about earlier.

36:10.564 --> 36:11.565
Don't worry about it.

36:18.105 --> 36:19.774
Does it bother you
that she can't have kids?

36:24.945 --> 36:26.080
Sometimes.

36:30.582 --> 36:32.417
But I don't like
to think that far ahead.

36:49.802 --> 36:51.236
Why'd you really come here?

36:52.603 --> 36:55.173
- I did try and call you to tell you...
- Look. Look.

36:56.841 --> 36:58.109
I don't wanna talk about that.

37:03.446 --> 37:05.882
- Ed, there's something.
- Christ!

37:05.916 --> 37:07.416
There's nothing to talk about.

37:07.449 --> 37:08.819
Just enjoy your weekend here.

37:08.852 --> 37:10.319
Why are you being like this?

37:15.692 --> 37:17.760
Because there's always
someone listening.

37:19.595 --> 37:20.830
Who's listening?

37:25.801 --> 37:27.502
That fucking weirdo, David.

37:28.870 --> 37:30.939
<i>Jenny called me earlier.</i>

37:30.972 --> 37:33.875
She said I can start the
babysitting job next week.

37:40.814 --> 37:44.751
You know, they say it's bad for you
to use your phone before sleeping.

37:44.785 --> 37:48.487
Something about suppressed levels of
melatonin and exposure to blue light.

37:49.823 --> 37:51.490
Really?

37:51.524 --> 37:54.293
Is it also bad
if I see you exposed?

37:55.427 --> 37:57.730
Why has everything got to be
sexual with you, babe?

38:00.066 --> 38:01.667
I see you're
in a better mood then.

38:04.368 --> 38:06.503
It's your birthday weekend.

38:06.537 --> 38:08.405
I don't want to
talk about it, okay?

38:13.645 --> 38:15.980
Is this the part
where you tell me to wait

38:16.013 --> 38:17.815
while you get a strap-on?

38:17.848 --> 38:20.851
That story has really got
into your head, hasn't it?

38:28.024 --> 38:28.925
Come here.

38:50.212 --> 38:51.412
Love you.

38:53.614 --> 38:55.216
You do?

38:56.751 --> 38:57.885
Of course.

39:06.860 --> 39:08.261
I want you to know

39:09.296 --> 39:10.597
whatever happens,

39:12.232 --> 39:13.934
I'll never leave you.

39:41.625 --> 39:43.126
No, wait.

39:43.160 --> 39:44.428
She'll hear us.

39:45.395 --> 39:46.763
That's the fun part.

44:47.272 --> 44:48.740
Morning.

44:48.773 --> 44:49.675
Hey.

44:49.709 --> 44:51.710
Just want to apologize
for last night.

44:51.742 --> 44:53.077
- It wasn't cool.
- No.

44:53.110 --> 44:54.745
No, I'm sorry too.

45:03.254 --> 45:06.889
Hey. Hey, what's the matter?

45:07.457 --> 45:08.858
Ah...

45:08.891 --> 45:09.792
Just...

45:11.394 --> 45:13.196
Doesn't matter.

45:13.229 --> 45:14.632
I'm okay.

45:15.764 --> 45:17.232
It's about last night.

45:18.267 --> 45:19.501
No, no, no.

45:19.534 --> 45:20.902
Honestly...

45:22.971 --> 45:24.072
I'm fine.

45:26.141 --> 45:28.009
Um...

45:28.042 --> 45:29.711
We're gonna go
for a walk after breakfast.

45:29.745 --> 45:30.712
Do you wanna come?

45:30.746 --> 45:32.546
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

45:32.581 --> 45:34.348
All right. Cool.
I'll see you downstairs.

45:34.382 --> 45:35.916
- Okay.
- Okay.

45:41.021 --> 45:42.856
Oh, um, Liv?

45:42.889 --> 45:43.857
Yeah?

45:43.890 --> 45:45.925
I don't have anything
to wear for the walk.

45:45.959 --> 45:48.629
Oh, just grab something
from my wardrobe in your room.

45:48.663 --> 45:50.330
Okay. Thanks.

47:42.733 --> 47:44.234
You sure you're okay?

47:44.267 --> 47:46.771
Yeah.
Yeah, hundred percent.

47:48.905 --> 47:51.440
So you guys have got
pretty serious, I see.

47:52.074 --> 47:53.108
Yeah.

47:54.243 --> 47:56.345
I mean,
that's a good thing, right?

47:56.378 --> 47:58.414
It's a phase
most relationships go through.

47:58.447 --> 48:01.818
Yeah, and then the sex slowly dies off.

48:01.851 --> 48:03.619
It's not always
the case, though.

48:03.652 --> 48:06.254
Some couples do
into their 60s.

48:06.287 --> 48:08.923
That's comforting to know.

48:13.060 --> 48:15.462
Sometimes I feel like
he's gonna leave me.

48:17.063 --> 48:18.900
What makes you say that?

48:19.767 --> 48:22.870
He's so smart and hard-working.

48:22.904 --> 48:25.338
He's got everything
that he needs, and I'm just

48:25.372 --> 48:27.473
wondering what does
he get from me?

48:28.307 --> 48:29.876
And how I'm just...

48:29.910 --> 48:32.445
I'm constantly trying
to please him and...

48:32.478 --> 48:35.314
And be there for him
and make him happy, you know.

48:36.949 --> 48:40.952
Sometimes I just get the impression
I'm always doing the wrong thing or...

48:40.985 --> 48:43.321
Or I've said
the wrong thing.

48:43.889 --> 48:45.891
Then I just...

48:45.925 --> 48:48.993
I get this guilty feeling,
like it's all my fault.

48:50.495 --> 48:52.162
That feeling, it just...

48:54.799 --> 48:57.434
takes over and destroys me.

48:59.704 --> 49:02.439
Am I even
making any sense?

49:02.473 --> 49:03.807
Yeah.

49:03.841 --> 49:05.408
Yeah, I completely get you.

49:06.844 --> 49:09.078
But the thing is, Liv,

49:09.111 --> 49:12.916
it's that you're also smart
and stunning.

49:12.950 --> 49:15.150
You don't have to build
your life around him.

49:15.183 --> 49:17.486
Go and find something
you want to do.

49:17.519 --> 49:18.987
Something for yourself.

49:23.492 --> 49:26.361
So, I felt like
this is none of my business,

49:26.863 --> 49:28.529
but I've got to ask.

49:29.396 --> 49:31.900
What happened
with you two last night?

49:32.433 --> 49:34.068
What do you mean?

49:34.101 --> 49:37.037
Just heard some banging and
shouting coming from your room.

49:37.071 --> 49:41.307
Oh, that, yeah. He does
some crazy workout before bed.

49:43.544 --> 49:45.378
Hey. There you go.

49:51.216 --> 49:54.353
Hi. What are you two
talking about?

49:54.386 --> 49:55.788
Just girly stuff.

49:55.822 --> 49:57.322
Heavy mind.

50:36.225 --> 50:38.294
Look, there's that freak again.

50:55.509 --> 50:57.679
- Hi.
- Shit. Gracie, I forgot you were coming.

50:57.712 --> 50:59.179
I'm just heading out
for a class.

50:59.212 --> 51:00.514
- I can come back later if you want.
- No, no, no, It's fine.

51:00.548 --> 51:03.717
- Ed's inside. Um, I'll see you later.
- Okay.

51:23.134 --> 51:24.402
Ed.

53:15.470 --> 53:17.773
- What's your problem?
- Don't shout at him.

53:18.206 --> 53:19.742
Get back inside.

53:20.710 --> 53:21.811
Fucking nut job.

53:46.600 --> 53:48.401
Babe,

53:48.434 --> 53:50.604
did you say something
to Grace about us?

53:52.270 --> 53:55.608
I probably have to say
the cornflower.

53:56.441 --> 53:59.612
Cornflower
symbolizes hope.

53:59.645 --> 54:02.215
Yeah, that's right.

54:02.247 --> 54:04.281
Cornflower also known as

54:05.483 --> 54:06.518
ba...

54:07.485 --> 54:09.755
bachelor's button
or basket flower.

54:09.788 --> 54:12.891
Yeah. How do you know
so much about flowers?

54:12.924 --> 54:16.060
I read books on British flowers.

54:16.093 --> 54:18.261
Probably know more than
my local florist.

54:20.097 --> 54:21.397
Ed?

54:21.431 --> 54:23.234
Hm? What?

54:23.266 --> 54:25.102
What did you say
to Grace last night?

54:25.136 --> 54:26.570
I saw you two together.

54:26.604 --> 54:28.571
Nothing. Why?

54:28.605 --> 54:30.640
She's just been poking around
asking questions.

54:30.673 --> 54:32.609
So I thought
you might have said stuff.

54:33.308 --> 54:35.044
I just said nothing, didn't I?

54:35.078 --> 54:36.411
Yeah, I heard you.

54:36.445 --> 54:37.747
There's no need to shout.

54:39.413 --> 54:43.252
David, I have to ask
you something.

54:43.284 --> 54:45.754
And I need you
to tell me the truth.

54:45.788 --> 54:47.222
Can you do that?

54:49.858 --> 54:52.894
Yesterday you said to me "bad."

54:54.128 --> 54:55.630
What's bad?

54:59.901 --> 55:01.569
I wasn't shouting.

55:01.602 --> 55:04.237
- This is my calm voice.
- You were shouting.

55:04.271 --> 55:06.472
I was shouting? Okay.

55:06.506 --> 55:08.775
Do you wanna hear
my shouting voice?

55:08.809 --> 55:11.511
This is me fucking shouting!

55:11.945 --> 55:13.312
Don't start.

55:13.345 --> 55:16.582
Because you'll regret it
like you always fucking do!

55:16.615 --> 55:19.484
- You... You're doing it again.
- I'm doing what?

55:19.518 --> 55:21.153
Trying
to make me feel...

55:21.187 --> 55:24.322
Trying to make me
feel like I'm the guilty one here.

55:24.355 --> 55:26.424
- So I'm the one to blame?
- I never said that.

55:26.457 --> 55:28.159
Well, weren't you implying it?

55:28.193 --> 55:29.661
- Tell me!
- I've already told you.

55:29.694 --> 55:31.963
I didn't say anything
to your stupid friend about us.

55:31.996 --> 55:33.665
My stupid friend,

55:33.698 --> 55:35.767
who came here
to celebrate your birthday?

55:35.800 --> 55:37.001
I never asked for that.

55:37.035 --> 55:38.603
You're an ungrateful prick.

55:38.636 --> 55:41.672
Don't you dare start telling me
how ungrateful I am.

55:41.705 --> 55:43.807
I let you live here.
I support you in everything.

55:43.841 --> 55:45.542
You wanted to be an artist,
so I paid for your art classes

55:45.576 --> 55:47.578
for six weeks
until you went to play piano.

55:47.611 --> 55:50.479
And guess who paid
for those too? Me.

55:50.514 --> 55:52.248
Me.

55:52.281 --> 55:54.617
Well, when a man,
a real fucking man

55:54.650 --> 55:57.253
loves a woman,
he'd do anything for her.

55:57.286 --> 55:59.522
And for the record, I had
to quit that class

55:59.555 --> 56:02.124
because the guy wanted to sleep with me.

56:02.158 --> 56:03.291
Well, maybe you should
have slept with him.

56:03.325 --> 56:05.794
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you.

56:05.827 --> 56:08.063
You begged me
to move out here with you.

56:08.096 --> 56:11.199
I left my friends
and family for you!

56:11.233 --> 56:12.901
So what am I supposed to do?

56:14.902 --> 56:16.704
Get a job.

56:16.737 --> 56:19.740
Did you see something bad
happen at that house?

56:24.945 --> 56:26.580
What did you see, David?

56:28.748 --> 56:31.351
Did you see someone
doing bad things?

56:31.383 --> 56:32.852
Is that what you meant?

56:36.055 --> 56:38.591
What did you see, David?

57:28.870 --> 57:30.004
What happened?

57:31.739 --> 57:33.308
Where's Liv?

57:34.943 --> 57:36.411
She's, uh...

57:40.847 --> 57:42.316
She's upstairs.

58:22.152 --> 58:23.787
Oh, my God, Liv.

58:25.556 --> 58:26.956
Did he do this to you?

58:33.696 --> 58:35.598
How long has this
been going on?

58:38.401 --> 58:39.868
A few months.

58:44.072 --> 58:46.041
It wasn't always
like this, though.

58:48.877 --> 58:53.080
We used to go out for meals
and trips to the seaside.

58:55.483 --> 58:57.551
We were proper in love.

58:58.552 --> 59:00.688
Like the perfect couple,
you know.

59:03.556 --> 59:06.026
He made me so happy.

59:10.730 --> 59:12.065
And then...

59:14.067 --> 59:17.069
he started to take on
more cases from work.

59:19.705 --> 59:21.607
And he just stopped caring.

59:24.043 --> 59:27.078
He doesn't even make an effort
to talk to me anymore.

59:28.246 --> 59:30.848
It's like I don't exist
in his life.

59:32.550 --> 59:34.018
And when I would try
to make effort,

59:34.052 --> 59:36.387
he would just tell me that I
wasn't giving him enough space.

59:36.421 --> 59:38.056
No, stop, stop, Liv.

59:39.189 --> 59:41.925
None of this is your fault.

59:44.495 --> 59:47.064
You guys, you just
shouldn't be together.

59:48.432 --> 59:50.833
It's not that easy, Grace.

59:50.866 --> 59:52.034
Why isn't it?

59:55.337 --> 59:57.206
I can't live without him.

59:58.274 --> 01:00:00.276
I just can't.

01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:01.911
Well, if you don't
tell him, I will.

01:00:01.944 --> 01:00:03.978
No. No, no, you can't.

01:00:05.548 --> 01:00:08.349
He said if anyone
ever found out,

01:00:08.383 --> 01:00:09.751
he would kill himself, Grace.

01:00:09.784 --> 01:00:12.954
- No, Liv, this isn't healthy.
- No, wait.

01:00:13.955 --> 01:00:14.955
What?

01:00:18.225 --> 01:00:20.094
I hate him

01:00:20.127 --> 01:00:22.229
for what he's done to me, I do.

01:00:23.764 --> 01:00:26.200
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What was I supposed to say?

01:00:26.233 --> 01:00:28.134
Well, I could have helped you.

01:00:44.149 --> 01:00:45.717
I want to get back at him.

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:52.491
I've just never had the courage
to do anything by myself.

01:01:00.297 --> 01:01:01.999
What do you want to do to him?

01:01:44.671 --> 01:01:46.339
Is she okay?

01:01:48.074 --> 01:01:49.910
Yeah, she's fine.

01:01:52.945 --> 01:01:55.080
Did she tell you
what happened?

01:01:57.316 --> 01:01:58.984
Yeah, she did.

01:02:04.590 --> 01:02:06.024
Look...

01:02:07.192 --> 01:02:09.761
we've all been having
a hard time lately.

01:02:11.162 --> 01:02:13.632
Why don't we have
a few drinks tonight, yeah?

01:02:18.135 --> 01:02:21.305
I just love her
so fucking much, you know.

01:02:23.608 --> 01:02:25.909
It just hurts me
to see her like this.

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:27.910
Yeah, I know.

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:31.648
I know.

01:02:37.386 --> 01:02:38.920
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:02:46.861 --> 01:02:48.296
Someone used a...

01:02:48.330 --> 01:02:51.398
No. That was so good.

01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:57.838
Baby.

01:02:57.871 --> 01:03:00.774
Why don't you tell us
another lesbian story?

01:03:00.808 --> 01:03:03.142
Mm-hmm. I've got no more.

01:03:03.176 --> 01:03:05.546
Well, that's right.
Do you know why?

01:03:05.579 --> 01:03:06.913
Why?

01:03:06.946 --> 01:03:09.749
'Cause you too can create
a new lesbian story.

01:03:09.782 --> 01:03:12.318
Ha. In your dreams, Ed.

01:03:21.126 --> 01:03:22.729
Let's play a game.

01:03:22.761 --> 01:03:24.363
I love games.

01:03:25.264 --> 01:03:27.532
You're gonna be blindfolded,

01:03:27.566 --> 01:03:28.933
one of us is gonna
dance with you,

01:03:28.966 --> 01:03:30.835
and you have to guess
who it is.

01:03:30.868 --> 01:03:32.738
Fuck yeah, bring it on.

01:03:41.579 --> 01:03:42.812
Turn around.

01:04:17.944 --> 01:04:20.648
Fuck, this is hard.

01:04:20.682 --> 01:04:22.784
No, I don't mean the arse.

01:04:22.816 --> 01:04:24.318
I just mean...

01:04:24.885 --> 01:04:27.320
I mean, I've got no idea

01:04:27.353 --> 01:04:28.921
who this is.

01:04:32.459 --> 01:04:34.126
Is that you, Liv?

01:04:39.197 --> 01:04:40.800
Oh, fuck!

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.035
The fuck did you do that for?

01:04:53.745 --> 01:04:55.379
I love this song.

01:05:01.018 --> 01:05:03.119
Oh, you're too young
to know this song.

01:05:07.558 --> 01:05:10.426
Okay, grandpa,
it's your bedtime.

01:05:11.194 --> 01:05:13.464
What? No.

01:05:13.497 --> 01:05:17.467
It's my birthday, so I'm gonna
fucking dance all night long.

01:05:19.968 --> 01:05:22.505
Polly, let's dance.

01:05:25.541 --> 01:05:27.776
Oh, fuck y'all doing? Come on.

01:08:23.103 --> 01:08:25.939
Grace, wake up.

01:08:27.206 --> 01:08:30.042
- What took you so long?
- Come on, let's go.

01:09:21.023 --> 01:09:23.559
Liv, what are you doing?

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:26.627
I'm just going to pee, babe.

01:09:26.661 --> 01:09:27.862
Go back to sleep.

01:09:27.895 --> 01:09:30.331
Hmm. Okay.

01:10:03.829 --> 01:10:06.163
I don't remember
what the pin is.

01:10:06.197 --> 01:10:08.165
Well, how am I supposed
to know?

01:10:08.867 --> 01:10:10.669
I did not think about this.

01:10:11.135 --> 01:10:12.804
Try his birthday.

01:10:13.337 --> 01:10:14.337
Okay.

01:10:16.406 --> 01:10:18.676
Fuck.

01:10:20.444 --> 01:10:22.513
What do you think
it could be?

01:10:22.546 --> 01:10:23.714
Um...

01:10:24.849 --> 01:10:26.348
Try your birthday.

01:10:26.683 --> 01:10:28.084
Okay.

01:10:31.755 --> 01:10:34.323
Um... Polly.

01:10:34.356 --> 01:10:37.192
- Try Polly's birthday.
- Polly's birthday, right, okay.

01:10:43.799 --> 01:10:45.400
Jackpot.

01:10:45.968 --> 01:10:47.436
Fuck!

01:10:48.003 --> 01:10:49.237
How much money is that?

01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:51.238
I know. I told you.

01:10:55.143 --> 01:10:56.477
Are we just gonna walk out
of here like this?

01:10:56.511 --> 01:10:58.980
No, of course not.
We're not stupid.

01:10:59.013 --> 01:11:01.882
He'll know it's us.

01:11:01.915 --> 01:11:04.785
I'll come up with an excuse for us
to get away in the morning, okay?

01:11:04.818 --> 01:11:07.521
Well, what if he finds out his
things are missing before we leave?

01:11:10.389 --> 01:11:13.627
Then I'll tell him
that we've been burgled. Yeah?

01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:15.561
It sounds like you got it
all figured out then.

01:11:25.504 --> 01:11:27.739
Hey, let's keep looking, okay?

01:11:27.772 --> 01:11:29.507
You look in there.

01:11:43.954 --> 01:11:45.723
- Grace.
- Yeah.

01:11:51.127 --> 01:11:54.697
I know he's got more stuff in here.
Just need to find it.

01:11:55.098 --> 01:11:56.666
Take this.

01:12:02.604 --> 01:12:04.473
Shit. Shit!

01:12:20.755 --> 01:12:22.823
Oh, my God. I think
I'm gonna be sick.

01:12:33.298 --> 01:12:35.300
What the fuck are
we gonna do now?

01:12:35.969 --> 01:12:38.203
- Liv?
- I'm thinking.

01:12:42.975 --> 01:12:44.476
We're gonna have
to bury the dog.

01:12:46.512 --> 01:12:49.181
And we leave before
he finds out she's even gone.

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:50.948
This is insane.

01:12:50.982 --> 01:12:52.550
We're seriously fucked.

01:14:22.733 --> 01:14:25.336
Polly. Walkies time.

01:14:32.609 --> 01:14:33.643
Hmm.

01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:35.511
That's odd.

01:14:36.346 --> 01:14:38.714
Polly. Where are you, girl?

01:15:00.167 --> 01:15:01.668
Have you seen the dog?

01:15:05.872 --> 01:15:07.407
What's up? Did something
happen to the dog?

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:09.943
What? No. I think someone
broke in last night.

01:15:09.976 --> 01:15:11.578
- And then...
- So you haven't seen Polly?

01:15:11.611 --> 01:15:14.613
No, Ed. I haven't seen
your flipping dog.

01:15:34.132 --> 01:15:35.400
Polly.

01:15:39.569 --> 01:15:41.071
He's gonna find it.

01:15:42.306 --> 01:15:44.741
No. He won't.

01:15:51.213 --> 01:15:52.348
He's standing
right next to it.

01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:53.783
He's gonna see the dog.

01:15:59.221 --> 01:16:00.156
Oh, my God.

01:16:09.764 --> 01:16:11.099
Polly!

01:16:11.132 --> 01:16:13.500
See? Told you.

01:16:15.302 --> 01:16:16.937
How could he have
not found it?

01:16:17.471 --> 01:16:19.173
I don't know.

01:16:19.206 --> 01:16:20.774
Let's get our things and go.

01:16:20.808 --> 01:16:22.910
I don't think it's
a good time to leave.

01:16:22.943 --> 01:16:24.111
He'll know.

01:16:25.112 --> 01:16:26.447
I have an idea.

01:16:37.323 --> 01:16:38.458
Fuck!

01:16:42.961 --> 01:16:46.665
Babe, maybe Polly got scared
by the burglars last night

01:16:46.698 --> 01:16:48.600
and just ran off somewhere.

01:16:48.633 --> 01:16:50.001
Well, maybe they took her.

01:16:50.701 --> 01:16:51.902
No.

01:16:51.936 --> 01:16:55.039
I really don't think they
came here to take your dog, Ed.

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:03.813
Listen.

01:17:03.847 --> 01:17:07.150
Grace and I will go out
for a drive to look for her.

01:17:07.183 --> 01:17:09.119
And I'll call you
if we find her.

01:17:09.152 --> 01:17:11.121
- I'll come with you.
- No, I...

01:17:11.154 --> 01:17:13.456
I think you should stay here
in case she comes back, right?

01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:14.990
I said I'm coming with you.

01:17:19.328 --> 01:17:20.696
What's this, Liv?

01:17:35.009 --> 01:17:36.677
What the fuck?

01:17:42.015 --> 01:17:43.650
Ed! That's enough!

01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:39.267
Ed.

01:18:42.405 --> 01:18:44.973
Ed, what's going on?

01:18:45.907 --> 01:18:47.809
What?

01:18:53.814 --> 01:18:54.949
Liv.

01:18:56.350 --> 01:18:57.818
Why am I being tied up?

01:19:04.657 --> 01:19:06.893
I'm disappointed in you, Grace.

01:19:07.528 --> 01:19:08.995
What are you talking about?

01:19:11.297 --> 01:19:12.399
What's wrong with Ed?

01:19:15.435 --> 01:19:17.437
He's in a happy place right now.

01:19:17.470 --> 01:19:18.904
Look at him.

01:19:22.174 --> 01:19:23.709
Oh, sorry.

01:19:30.848 --> 01:19:33.385
You know,
it's actually quite ironic,

01:19:33.418 --> 01:19:34.819
given your profession.

01:19:35.186 --> 01:19:36.254
What?

01:19:36.287 --> 01:19:38.054
The last time you came,

01:19:38.088 --> 01:19:40.991
after you left,
I found something that belonged to you...

01:19:42.659 --> 01:19:44.761
in the shower room upstairs.

01:19:46.430 --> 01:19:48.098
A hair.

01:19:48.131 --> 01:19:53.302
You see, I know how particular
Ed is about that room.

01:19:54.336 --> 01:19:56.105
Not even I'm allowed to use it.

01:20:03.512 --> 01:20:05.381
At first I told myself
it was nothing.

01:20:10.452 --> 01:20:13.820
But then my suspicion grew

01:20:13.854 --> 01:20:16.223
after I heard you two
talking last night.

01:20:19.193 --> 01:20:20.694
Shut up, Ed!

01:20:26.832 --> 01:20:29.302
Why would you want to be
with a woman beater, anyway?

01:20:33.839 --> 01:20:35.041
I'm pregnant.

01:20:41.012 --> 01:20:41.880
What?

01:20:43.715 --> 01:20:44.883
I'm pregnant.

01:20:45.551 --> 01:20:46.485
What?

01:20:47.752 --> 01:20:49.387
Why didn't you tell me?

01:20:50.321 --> 01:20:51.956
I tried to tell you.

01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:57.094
Liv...

01:20:58.663 --> 01:21:00.432
I love you so much.

01:21:05.201 --> 01:21:06.069
Oh.

01:21:07.303 --> 01:21:08.405
Do you?

01:21:09.573 --> 01:21:10.773
Yeah.

01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:18.747
Fuck you!

01:21:27.456 --> 01:21:28.789
Can you stop it?

01:21:28.823 --> 01:21:30.459
Please stop it.

01:21:46.139 --> 01:21:47.107
And what?

01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:49.542
What were you gonna do anyway?

01:21:49.576 --> 01:21:52.077
Run off together
with your little baby?

01:21:52.111 --> 01:21:54.280
That wasn't the first time
you hit him, was it?

01:21:57.149 --> 01:21:58.485
What did you say?

01:22:00.219 --> 01:22:02.588
I figured you might have
heard us talking last night,

01:22:02.621 --> 01:22:04.122
so I needed some leverage.

01:22:05.957 --> 01:22:07.792
I knew something
strange was happening

01:22:07.825 --> 01:22:09.461
from the moment I got here.

01:22:11.296 --> 01:22:14.965
Then when I asked David,
he told me everything.

01:22:15.999 --> 01:22:18.469
What did you see, David?

01:22:38.621 --> 01:22:39.789
Told you what?

01:22:42.223 --> 01:22:45.160
That you abuse him,
day after day.

01:22:45.193 --> 01:22:48.997
The screaming
and the self-harming.

01:22:54.168 --> 01:22:56.003
And you believe that freak?

01:22:57.905 --> 01:22:59.374
Even if you did,

01:23:00.508 --> 01:23:01.841
what are you gonna do?

01:23:03.176 --> 01:23:05.111
Tell people that I beat him up?

01:23:06.513 --> 01:23:08.181
They'll laugh in your face.

01:23:09.215 --> 01:23:12.118
Well, you see, I didn't
believe David at first.

01:23:18.391 --> 01:23:19.958
<i>Liv, it's gonna be okay.</i>

01:23:19.991 --> 01:23:21.627
<i>It's okay. Look at me.</i>

01:23:34.872 --> 01:23:36.207
<i>Liv, please.</i>

01:23:49.719 --> 01:23:52.054
Then I copied the videos
onto my phone.

01:23:54.056 --> 01:23:56.225
I can't believe the friend
that I grew up with

01:23:56.258 --> 01:23:57.226
could do that.

01:23:59.995 --> 01:24:02.029
I wanted to see
what you would do,

01:24:02.063 --> 01:24:03.432
so I played along.

01:24:05.066 --> 01:24:07.536
But you lied
and manipulated me,

01:24:07.569 --> 01:24:09.103
just like you do with Ed.

01:24:10.606 --> 01:24:12.574
Can we please not do this?

01:24:14.207 --> 01:24:18.579
I promise you,
I'll never leave you.

01:24:18.613 --> 01:24:20.882
- Give me your phone, Grace.
- No, I can't do that.

01:24:20.947 --> 01:24:23.350
- Give me your phone!
- Or what?

01:24:23.384 --> 01:24:26.218
You're gonna kill me,
like you killed his dog?

01:24:27.888 --> 01:24:29.389
You killed Polly?

01:24:30.222 --> 01:24:32.224
I didn't kill your dog.

01:24:32.726 --> 01:24:33.727
It was an accident.

01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:35.529
It was your idea to rob him.

01:24:35.562 --> 01:24:36.563
What?

01:24:37.463 --> 01:24:40.265
Hey... I trusted you.

01:24:41.199 --> 01:24:43.436
I trusted you with everything.

01:24:44.904 --> 01:24:46.539
How could you do this to me?

01:24:54.011 --> 01:24:55.145
What are you doing to him?

01:25:06.055 --> 01:25:08.157
He's got many more
fingers, Grace.

01:25:09.426 --> 01:25:11.260
So take your time
while you figure out

01:25:11.294 --> 01:25:12.563
to tell me
where your phone is.

01:25:12.596 --> 01:25:13.962
You're crazy.

01:25:13.995 --> 01:25:16.399
You really need some help.
This isn't normal.

01:25:19.836 --> 01:25:21.336
Okay, okay.

01:25:23.138 --> 01:25:24.306
I'll give it to you.

01:25:27.007 --> 01:25:28.209
It's in my car.

01:25:30.479 --> 01:25:31.746
Where's your car key?

01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:33.515
Here, in my pocket.

01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:42.288
Quick, untie me.

01:25:58.771 --> 01:26:01.038
No, no, no, no.

01:26:01.072 --> 01:26:03.509
Baby, stay with me.
You're gonna be okay.

01:26:06.879 --> 01:26:07.813
I'm sorry.

01:26:07.846 --> 01:26:10.147
No. No, it's okay. It's okay.

01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:14.184
You promised me
you'd never leave me.

01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:16.521
Yeah.

01:26:39.408 --> 01:26:41.544
Look what you've done,
you bitch!

01:26:42.678 --> 01:26:44.380
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

01:26:51.019 --> 01:26:52.353
No.

01:27:09.836 --> 01:27:12.338
Liv, we don't have
to do this.

01:27:39.597 --> 01:27:41.264
Fuck! No!

01:28:09.091 --> 01:28:10.859
Shit. Keys.

01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:21.991
Gracie.

01:29:24.225 --> 01:29:26.027
Are you looking for these?

01:29:33.668 --> 01:29:34.803
Strap on this.

01:29:38.405 --> 01:29:40.273
- Ah!
- Give me the keys!

01:31:48.025 --> 01:31:49.025
I got you.

01:32:06.708 --> 01:32:08.176
Who's that?

01:32:08.210 --> 01:32:10.645
- A friend.
- Oh, a friend.

01:32:13.647 --> 01:32:14.515
Yeah.

01:32:14.548 --> 01:32:16.050
She wants to meet you.

01:32:16.717 --> 01:32:17.818
Mmm.

01:32:18.385 --> 01:32:19.787
Tell me about her.

01:32:20.387 --> 01:32:21.655
Well...
