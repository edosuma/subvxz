01:42.311 --> 01:45.314
Hey, guys. What do you think would happen
if you fell from this height?

01:45.398 --> 01:47.566
You gotta work on your timing, dude.

01:47.651 --> 01:50.153
I'm... I'm just asking, you know.

01:51.195 --> 01:52.656
You think you'd die instantly, right?

01:52.739 --> 01:54.365
You sound like my grandma.

01:56.242 --> 01:57.744
You think this tank could leak?

02:00.246 --> 02:01.330
Fuck, this is high.

02:01.414 --> 02:02.707
It's fine.

02:03.958 --> 02:05.418
Well, boys.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.924
- To never being in high school again.
- Yeah.

02:11.007 --> 02:12.133
Except for Fish.

02:12.216 --> 02:14.636
Fuck off.
It's one class.

02:14.719 --> 02:17.346
You couldn't pay me enough
to walk back into that place again.

02:17.430 --> 02:18.932
What about a million dollars?

02:19.933 --> 02:21.851
Yeah, I'd do it for that.

02:23.352 --> 02:26.397
The prison almost looks, like...
pretty at night.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.566
- Doesn't it sort of look like school?
- Mmm-hmm.

02:28.650 --> 02:31.027
Oh, shit, it totally does.
With all the lights.

02:31.903 --> 02:33.780
Looks like the football field.

02:33.863 --> 02:36.157
I can't believe we're, like,
actually adults now.

02:36.825 --> 02:39.035
We should start taking
vitamins or some shit.

02:39.118 --> 02:41.955
And, like, the swallow kind
that smell weird.

02:42.038 --> 02:43.081
Not the gummy bears.

02:43.164 --> 02:44.623
I like the gummy bears.

02:47.168 --> 02:49.420
- Want a hit?
- I'm good.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.297
Oh, come on, pussy.

02:51.380 --> 02:54.425
Are you afraid that you're gonna end up
down there with all the danger dykes?

02:54.508 --> 02:56.469
You think they're all
dyking out right now?

02:56.552 --> 02:58.763
Like...

02:58.847 --> 03:00.264
Fine, give me that.

03:02.767 --> 03:04.185
I heard one of 'em
cut her husband's dick off.

03:06.437 --> 03:08.647
Man, that's harsh.

03:14.237 --> 03:15.238
Shit.

03:16.990 --> 03:18.657
<i>You're on private property.</i>

03:18.742 --> 03:20.869
<i>Get your punk asses down here.</i>

03:22.620 --> 03:23.788
Fuck.

03:24.956 --> 03:26.082
Go, go, go.

03:27.959 --> 03:29.377
Oh, God. Down is worse.

03:31.045 --> 03:32.046
Mr. Caputo.

03:32.130 --> 03:34.298
Jesus Christ, Bayley!

03:34.382 --> 03:35.842
I'm sorry, sir.

03:35.925 --> 03:37.719
What the hell are you doing?

03:37.802 --> 03:39.678
I misjudged the approach.

03:39.763 --> 03:41.973
But, uh... I need to talk to you
about something.

03:42.056 --> 03:44.683
Is it more important
than a federal investigation

03:44.768 --> 03:46.310
into a murder on our property?

03:46.394 --> 03:48.187
Mr. Caputo, it's important.

03:48.271 --> 03:50.606
Fine... out with it.

03:51.607 --> 03:54.944
Uh, Humps, the guard.
Humphrey?

03:55.028 --> 03:58.114
He, um, was making the inmates, uh, fight.

03:58.197 --> 04:00.784
Like, forcing them to.

04:00.867 --> 04:02.786
Like a... a gladiator match?

04:02.869 --> 04:06.664
It was really upsetting, and I just...
I thought you should know.

04:06.748 --> 04:08.041
What? When?

04:08.666 --> 04:10.251
Last night, during the interrogations.

04:11.669 --> 04:13.296
What interrogations?

04:14.172 --> 04:15.840
The ones Piscatella was conducting.

04:21.387 --> 04:23.597
- I will take care of this.
- Yeah.

04:23.681 --> 04:26.475
And thank you, Bayley.
You did a good thing by telling me.

04:26.559 --> 04:28.561
Yeah, okay. Thanks.
No problem, sir.

04:30.354 --> 04:32.231
Who was it? In the fight?

04:35.568 --> 04:37.528
This isn't your fault.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.280
You hear me?

04:39.363 --> 04:42.158
Everyone saw.
Man, he made you fight.

04:42.241 --> 04:44.285
You see? Nobody's mad at you.

04:44.368 --> 04:46.454
Man, I don't know what else to do.

04:48.664 --> 04:50.917
I mean, look, should we call her moms?

04:51.000 --> 04:52.376
Ask her if this happens sometimes?

04:52.460 --> 04:54.420
We can't let nobody see her like this.

04:54.503 --> 04:57.173
Man, they'll take her ass to Psych,
and we'll never see her again.

05:00.093 --> 05:02.386
Ain't gotta worry about Psych
if the eight-eight get to her first.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.973
- We got a problem.
- Yeah, what the fuck do you want?

05:05.056 --> 05:07.475
You get Bald Eagle,
and I got Coal Miner's Daughter here.

05:07.558 --> 05:09.936
It's that fucking guard, Humps.

05:10.769 --> 05:11.770
Come again?

05:11.855 --> 05:14.357
We need to take care
of that pus hole of a man.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.734
We didn't come here to fight.
Enough of that going around.

05:16.818 --> 05:18.820
You had me at pus hole.

05:18.903 --> 05:21.072
You know that psycho locked me in a room?

05:21.155 --> 05:24.367
Made me tell him whether I'd rather eat
my mom or my dad?

05:24.909 --> 05:26.577
Wouldn't let me go till I said.

05:27.912 --> 05:30.289
Having to think like that,
it changes a person.

05:32.166 --> 05:33.167
She all right?

05:34.377 --> 05:36.712
Not really.
The other girl?

05:36.795 --> 05:38.464
Down in medical.
Ain't pretty.

05:38.547 --> 05:40.508
That asshole did this to them.

05:40.591 --> 05:42.760
We're aiming to get him out of here
by any means necessary.

05:42.843 --> 05:46.139
By any means necessary.

05:47.015 --> 05:48.641
You in?

05:48.724 --> 05:49.976
Well, hold up, wait.

05:50.059 --> 05:51.936
Ain't y'all the people trying
to reinstate slavery?

05:53.854 --> 05:55.439
I guess it's like, uh...

05:55.523 --> 05:59.152
if you were gonna rank our hate,
you guys are here...

05:59.235 --> 06:00.653
and Humps is here.

06:09.287 --> 06:10.704
We're in.

06:12.999 --> 06:15.751
Aw, you thought it was sleepy time.

06:15.834 --> 06:18.129
I believe you're scheduled
in the kitchen, inmate.

06:20.048 --> 06:22.967
The girls said they could handle it
without me this morning.

06:23.051 --> 06:25.053
The girls aren't in charge of work duty.

06:26.429 --> 06:28.014
I've gotten no rest.

06:28.097 --> 06:31.767
Do you know what inmates
with illegal sets of keys don't get to do?

06:31.850 --> 06:34.228
Technically,
I don't have the keys anymore.

06:34.312 --> 06:35.980
You took them.

06:36.064 --> 06:38.732
Get up.

06:38.816 --> 06:40.359
Fine.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.825
You want me to stay up?

06:47.908 --> 06:49.243
I'll stay up.

06:49.327 --> 06:50.661
Watch me.

07:08.012 --> 07:09.888
- Hey, baby.
- Oh, hi.

07:09.973 --> 07:12.725
Come and take a break with me?
Just for a minute?

07:14.602 --> 07:17.313
Oh, we're going into the...

07:24.487 --> 07:27.406
Pretty lame buttons
in this time machine.

07:30.118 --> 07:31.119
Ew.

07:37.458 --> 07:38.709
Dance with me.

07:40.878 --> 07:42.088
We ain't got no music.

07:42.171 --> 07:44.673
Nobody's fact-checking that.

07:44.757 --> 07:45.883
True.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.724
You know, this feels like...

07:53.807 --> 07:55.977
the most normal thing
I've done in a while.

08:00.231 --> 08:01.565
You okay?

08:01.649 --> 08:03.567
Suzanne's in rough shape, man.

08:03.651 --> 08:04.902
I heard.

08:05.987 --> 08:07.446
It's like we're in a horror movie.

08:07.530 --> 08:10.616
The kind you'd watch at sleepovers
when you were a kid...

08:11.575 --> 08:14.328
and then you'd have
to run to your mom at the end...

08:14.412 --> 08:17.165
hug you, tell you it was all made up.

08:18.124 --> 08:20.376
My mom wasn't a big hugger.

08:21.210 --> 08:22.586
My mom was.

08:24.505 --> 08:26.549
She had really long arms, too.

08:28.092 --> 08:29.843
Could almost double around you.

08:35.765 --> 08:36.892
So...

08:36.975 --> 08:40.229
what does this thing do, huh?

08:40.313 --> 08:42.606
You think we can go to the future,
or what?

08:42.690 --> 08:44.525
Yeah.

08:44.608 --> 08:47.486
It's... ten years from now.

08:47.570 --> 08:48.987
Mmm-hmm.

08:49.072 --> 08:52.408
We're old... and we're on vacation.

08:53.492 --> 08:54.785
Somewhere amazing.

08:55.828 --> 08:56.912
Let's say, Fiji.

08:56.995 --> 08:59.957
- Not Amsterdam no more?
- No, I'm going warmer.

09:00.041 --> 09:04.378
You know, like in one of those,
like, overwater bungalows.

09:04.462 --> 09:06.464
With a glass floor,
so we can watch the fish.

09:07.423 --> 09:09.092
Shit, man, that's a thing?

09:09.175 --> 09:10.551
Everything's a thing.

09:11.552 --> 09:15.681
I can't believe peeps be cutting
holes in the floor just to spy on fish.

09:15.764 --> 09:18.767
That's, like, violation of fish privacy.

09:18.851 --> 09:22.020
We should probably worry
about finding an apartment first.

09:23.772 --> 09:25.023
We're gonna need jobs.

09:26.192 --> 09:28.986
We'll just search
"jobs for former inmates"

09:29.070 --> 09:30.529
on the Interweb.

09:30.613 --> 09:31.697
You know, piece of cake.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.991
I'll just... shovel shit,
and you'll dig graves.

09:38.787 --> 09:41.124
Why don't you tell me
more about these fish, yeah?

09:41.207 --> 09:43.000
And their exhibitionist lifestyle.

09:48.589 --> 09:51.134
- My daddy was hot.
- Jesus Christ.

09:55.971 --> 09:57.140
Go home.

09:57.223 --> 09:59.350
Hell, I didn't expect
the red-carpet treatment,

09:59.433 --> 10:00.476
but at least pink.

10:00.559 --> 10:02.728
No, you ain't got time for jokes,
<i>est√∫pida.</i>

10:02.811 --> 10:05.106
- I'll shut the door.
- Okay, okay, chill.

10:05.189 --> 10:08.609
We here 'cause we need your help.
Coalition style.

10:08.692 --> 10:11.362
We are the world.
Common enemy.

10:11.445 --> 10:13.030
We gotta take down Humps.

10:13.114 --> 10:14.782
Humps?

10:15.783 --> 10:17.034
Who gives a shit about him?

10:17.118 --> 10:18.286
Stratman's the problem.

10:18.369 --> 10:21.247
Stratman's an asshole,
but Humps is dangerous.

10:21.330 --> 10:22.331
Uh-huh.

10:22.415 --> 10:24.292
You're just lookin'
right in front of you, huh?

10:24.375 --> 10:25.668
Where are we supposed to look?

10:25.751 --> 10:27.085
- Behind us?
- Always.

10:27.170 --> 10:29.505
You got another fuckin' guard
gettin' ready to search your ass.

10:29.588 --> 10:31.799
- Or kick it.
- Or stick his thumb in it.

10:31.882 --> 10:33.592
I think that was his thumb.

10:34.385 --> 10:38.139
You got a problem with someone,
you gotta look two feet above his head.

10:38.931 --> 10:40.183
That's your target.

10:41.142 --> 10:42.143
Piscatella.

10:42.226 --> 10:43.477
Exactly.

10:44.812 --> 10:47.815
This ain't a one-man problem. See?

10:47.898 --> 10:51.777
You gotta knock out the top,
take down the whole operation.

10:53.904 --> 10:55.489
Okay, so we good now?

10:56.240 --> 10:58.701
Ain't nobody gonna kill each other?

10:58.784 --> 11:01.119
'Cause the enemy of my enemy
ain't my enemy, right?

11:08.586 --> 11:11.129
All right... we're in.

11:20.556 --> 11:22.225
Come on.

11:22.308 --> 11:23.892
Hey, good to see you again, Sanka.

11:37.531 --> 11:39.658
All right, um, what color do you want?

11:41.118 --> 11:42.828
How about light pink?

11:55.924 --> 11:56.967
Pipes.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.388
What time is it?
What time is it?

12:01.389 --> 12:02.515
Where is everybody?

12:02.598 --> 12:03.849
They're at work.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.810
But they canceled
construction and grounds crew

12:06.894 --> 12:08.437
because of the active crime scene.

12:08.521 --> 12:10.356
So, snow day for us?

12:10.439 --> 12:11.857
A murder day.

12:11.940 --> 12:15.152
Yeah, well, that branding never
took off in the same way.

12:22.117 --> 12:23.243
How are you?

12:24.161 --> 12:26.497
Last night keeps playing
like a loop in my brain.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.167
I should've confessed.

12:30.250 --> 12:34.838
Alex... she was going down for it anyway.

12:34.922 --> 12:37.591
All that would have done
is send you down there with her.

12:39.217 --> 12:41.470
And I need you... here.

13:02.616 --> 13:05.661
- Do you think it's over now?
- What part?

13:05.744 --> 13:07.413
All of it.

13:08.497 --> 13:11.208
It feels like we've been living
in this chaos for a decade.

13:11.291 --> 13:14.002
I think they're gonna want this
wrapped up pretty quickly.

13:15.212 --> 13:17.423
So maybe now
we're on the other side of it?

13:20.634 --> 13:23.053
If you could go back...

13:23.136 --> 13:25.055
ten years ago, or whatever...

13:26.640 --> 13:28.308
and do it all again...

13:29.643 --> 13:30.769
would you?

13:30.853 --> 13:32.605
Fuck, no.

13:34.857 --> 13:36.066
Then you wouldn't have met me.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.901
Are you kidding?

13:37.985 --> 13:39.987
It didn't matter what choices we made,

13:40.070 --> 13:42.823
we would've ended up right here...

13:42.906 --> 13:45.743
on this fucking bed...

13:45.826 --> 13:47.703
sitting next to each other in prison.

13:49.204 --> 13:51.915
- Doomed to be together.
- Exactly.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.838
- You know what I'm ready for?
- What?

13:57.921 --> 14:01.341
- Things to be easy.
- We can do easy.

14:01.425 --> 14:02.510
I'm not buyin' it.

14:02.593 --> 14:04.553
We could try.

14:04.637 --> 14:08.432
We could be like old people
who talk about articles, and eat soup,

14:08.516 --> 14:13.020
and hold hands on the slow stroll
to the ass doctor for colonoscopies.

14:16.982 --> 14:18.025
Deal.

14:28.786 --> 14:30.413
Humphrey, right?

14:31.121 --> 14:32.581
I just call him Humps.
It's more fun that way.

14:35.292 --> 14:37.127
What the fuck was that about last night?

14:37.210 --> 14:41.006
The way I understand it, sir,
a body was found...

14:41.089 --> 14:44.843
An inmate is in medical
because of a fight you instigated.

14:46.136 --> 14:49.139
An inmate's in medical
because an ape had a tantrum.

14:52.810 --> 14:56.814
You are suspended for a month,
without pay.

14:57.773 --> 14:59.650
Get the fuck out of my sight!

14:59.733 --> 15:01.527
No one is suspended.

15:05.448 --> 15:07.491
That is not your call to make, Captain.

15:07.575 --> 15:09.743
And you are lucky
you still have that title,

15:09.827 --> 15:11.662
after the shit you pulled last night.

15:11.745 --> 15:14.039
You suspend him, I pull my entire staff.

15:14.122 --> 15:15.624
We walk.

15:15.708 --> 15:17.626
How'd that work out for you last time?

15:17.710 --> 15:21.254
These inmates are in our custody.

15:21.338 --> 15:25.217
And one of those precious, darling inmates
murdered one of your men.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.886
But it's good to know
whose side you're on, sir.

15:27.970 --> 15:30.473
It is not about taking sides!

15:30.556 --> 15:32.099
It is about respect!

15:32.182 --> 15:35.018
Respect for the inmates
and for the chain of command!

15:35.102 --> 15:39.356
I explicitly told you to wait for the Feds
before you questioned anybody.

15:39.440 --> 15:41.316
All due respect, sir,

15:41.399 --> 15:44.194
my men and I apprehended the murderer
last night while you were,

15:44.277 --> 15:45.696
I don't know, sleeping?

15:45.779 --> 15:48.741
Jerking off MCC?
Who cares?

15:48.824 --> 15:51.535
I know it's been a while
since you took the uniform off,

15:51.619 --> 15:54.913
but surely you remember what it's like
to be on the ground in here,

15:54.997 --> 15:58.208
or maybe your fancy suit
affects your memory?

16:00.127 --> 16:03.255
Enough is enough.

16:03.922 --> 16:05.841
You hired me to do a job,

16:05.924 --> 16:08.010
and now you're gonna let me do it.

16:08.093 --> 16:09.302
My way.

16:09.386 --> 16:11.221
Oh, and...

16:11.304 --> 16:13.474
the next time you want to interact
with my men,

16:13.557 --> 16:17.435
make sure it's to thank them
for their tireless work...

16:18.604 --> 16:19.813
instead of threatening them.

16:38.582 --> 16:39.958
We'll discuss this later.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.341
I could use a jelly.

16:48.425 --> 16:50.844
Oh, we're all out of jellies.
I had the last one.

16:50.928 --> 16:52.805
But there is sugar.
Here you go.

16:52.888 --> 16:56.684
Shit, shit, shit!
How am I gonna get a job with a record?

16:57.893 --> 16:59.603
How's it going in there, boys?

16:59.687 --> 17:02.773
Hey, sir, are our parents
on their way, or...

17:02.856 --> 17:04.232
Don't know what they can do for you, son.

17:04.316 --> 17:06.984
We got your friends,
Laurel and Hardy, two cells down.

17:07.069 --> 17:08.319
They told us everything.

17:08.403 --> 17:11.531
Yeah, the underage drinking
and the trespassing, we expected.

17:11.615 --> 17:14.992
The prostitutes and the heroin,
now that we didn't think was coming.

17:15.077 --> 17:16.994
What? The prostitutes? We didn't...

17:17.079 --> 17:21.040
Sir, I don't know
what they told you, but...

17:21.124 --> 17:24.252
I'm... I'm a virgin, so, um...

17:24.336 --> 17:26.378
Wait, so you lied about Jessica then?

17:26.463 --> 17:28.173
Uh... I, um...

17:28.256 --> 17:30.383
She was there, and...

17:30.467 --> 17:32.886
You're gonna have
to save it for the judge, son.

17:32.970 --> 17:37.808
Or I hear the, uh, murderers and rapists
over in county are great listeners,

17:37.891 --> 17:40.644
especially when it comes
to soft young boys.

17:40.728 --> 17:44.397
It's like therapy, but with more sodomy.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.903
Oh, I'm fucked.

17:49.987 --> 17:51.529
Oh, I'm so fucked.

17:51.614 --> 17:53.323
No, I was just fucking with you guys.

17:53.406 --> 17:57.369
Man, your faces.
We should've taken a picture.

17:57.452 --> 17:59.705
You were all like, "Oh, shit!"
Which is good.

18:00.789 --> 18:02.625
You should be scared, you idiots.

18:02.708 --> 18:03.917
What?

18:04.001 --> 18:05.168
Let's go.

18:06.712 --> 18:07.880
And you're out of here.

18:09.006 --> 18:10.966
Your friends are waiting
out in reception.

18:11.049 --> 18:12.843
Don't be stupid next time.

18:12.926 --> 18:15.679
There are plenty of places to drink
that aren't 100 feet above the ground.

18:15.763 --> 18:17.055
Yes, sir.

18:17.139 --> 18:19.182
We can just go?

18:19.266 --> 18:20.684
I mean... we had pot, too.

18:20.768 --> 18:23.771
- Is this kid serious?
- No, sir, he's not.

18:23.854 --> 18:25.438
- Let's go.
- We'll give you a ride home.

18:26.940 --> 18:29.234
Sir, who... who are Laurel and Hardy?

18:29.902 --> 18:32.613
So the goal is to get Piscatella fired.

18:36.867 --> 18:38.326
Or we could kill him.

18:38.410 --> 18:40.370
What the hell?

18:40.453 --> 18:43.123
Why, all of a sudden,
all you bitches want to murder folk?

18:43.206 --> 18:45.626
Like it's the new fall trend or some shit?

18:45.709 --> 18:47.795
It's not something I'd normally condone,

18:47.878 --> 18:49.880
- but I'm exhausted.
- Mmm.

18:49.963 --> 18:53.216
We could sit here for the next week
concocting an elaborate plan

18:53.300 --> 18:56.219
with lots of twists and turns, right?

18:56.303 --> 18:58.555
Or I could poison him... today.

18:58.639 --> 19:00.432
No one would know,

19:00.515 --> 19:02.810
and death is more permanent
than getting fired.

19:02.893 --> 19:05.395
But ain't no one getting punished
if he just drops dead.

19:05.478 --> 19:09.191
Look, I'm all "rah, rah, rah"
for this sisterhood thing,

19:09.274 --> 19:11.944
but I do not want
more time on my sentence.

19:12.027 --> 19:13.528
That ain't an option for me, neither.

19:13.611 --> 19:16.448
I don't hear anyone else
proposing a better idea.

19:21.578 --> 19:23.413
At my last prison, in Honolulu,

19:23.496 --> 19:26.416
a bunch of girls
organized a peaceful protest.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.711
Everyone sat in the yard,
sweating in the sun,

19:28.794 --> 19:32.297
and refused to move until the prison
changed its policies on job hiring.

19:32.380 --> 19:33.924
So, what?
They got thrown in the SHU?

19:34.007 --> 19:36.677
Oh, it worked.
They got the policies changed.

19:36.760 --> 19:41.181
Well, shit, girl, couldn't you have said
something maybe a half hour ago?

19:41.264 --> 19:42.766
You're all really loud.

19:42.850 --> 19:45.560
Especially the brown ones, am I right?

19:50.315 --> 19:52.275
We're not there yet.
Totally get it.

19:54.111 --> 19:57.405
- And what are you doing here, anyway?
- I'm representing the "others."

19:58.448 --> 19:59.491
Like on <i>Lost?</i>

19:59.574 --> 20:02.660
No, like the brown people
who aren't really brown.

20:02.745 --> 20:04.747
Oh, like yellow.

20:04.830 --> 20:06.123
Are you for real?

20:06.206 --> 20:08.583
We would need everyone to participate.

20:08.666 --> 20:11.920
If we're united, they can't single
anyone out for punishment.

20:12.004 --> 20:14.256
Between all of us,
we should be able to spread the word.

20:14.339 --> 20:15.883
We should do it by dinnertime.

20:15.966 --> 20:17.801
If we wait any longer,
someone'll tip off the guards,

20:17.885 --> 20:18.969
and then we're screwed.

20:19.928 --> 20:22.097
Hot damn, we're doing it.

20:23.056 --> 20:24.474
We need a leader.
Someone to call the shots.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.226
- Me.
- I'll do it.

20:29.396 --> 20:33.066
The majority is in my corner.
The most bodies equals the most power.

20:33.776 --> 20:38.696
Fine, you can be the leader
if we get more time in the TV room.

20:38.781 --> 20:40.532
We sure would like our table back
in the cafeteria.

20:40.615 --> 20:42.284
This is not a negotiation.

20:42.367 --> 20:44.202
Maybe it should be.

20:44.286 --> 20:46.329
Whose side are you on, husky hula doll?

20:49.207 --> 20:50.250
That was mean.

20:50.333 --> 20:53.045
I assisted you with a specific task.

20:53.128 --> 20:56.006
People will listen better
if there's a white person in charge.

20:56.089 --> 20:59.634
Man, what you gotta say about eight years
of Obama, you racist Nazi ho?

20:59.717 --> 21:02.971
To be fair, he didn't quite
live up to public expectations.

21:03.055 --> 21:05.473
You just wanna be in charge
so you can get back at us for Chapman.

21:05.557 --> 21:07.434
And you'd deserve it,
if that was my plan.

21:07.517 --> 21:09.186
We'll deal with that later.

21:09.269 --> 21:11.814
You people, always gotta
burn shit, don't you?

21:11.897 --> 21:14.691
You sneaky, white trash piece of shit.

21:14.775 --> 21:17.069
- Girls.
- Shut up, you old commie.

21:17.152 --> 21:18.862
I'm too tired.

21:18.946 --> 21:20.447
I'm just too tired.

21:20.530 --> 21:21.614
We tried.

21:27.495 --> 21:31.416
Mmm, there is not enough
water in the world to quench this thirst.

21:31.499 --> 21:33.293
Mmm.

21:33.376 --> 21:35.503
I'm a monster.

21:35.587 --> 21:38.631
Oh, honey, here.
Drink your seltzer and be quiet.

21:39.883 --> 21:43.553
I betrayed everything I believed in

21:43.636 --> 21:48.766
for water with bubbles and soft sheets.

21:48.851 --> 21:51.686
How am I gonna live with myself?

21:51.769 --> 21:53.897
Everything is terrible!

21:53.981 --> 21:55.941
Listen. Just listen up.

21:56.024 --> 21:58.360
Molly burned through your serotonin.

21:58.443 --> 22:01.446
Give it a month,
and things will be rosy again.

22:01.529 --> 22:02.697
A month?

22:02.780 --> 22:04.741
Mmm.

22:04.825 --> 22:06.827
Hey, there.

22:06.910 --> 22:08.829
- I don't want to interrupt.
- Hi!

22:08.912 --> 22:11.915
Um, you guys okay?
You both look a little sick.

22:13.458 --> 22:16.378
I could... use some air.

22:17.295 --> 22:19.006
Yeah, it is a little funky in here.

22:20.423 --> 22:21.591
Come on in.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.468
Rough night, right?

22:23.551 --> 22:26.013
You're telling me.

22:30.183 --> 22:33.061
I hope this isn't overstepping
professional boundaries, but...

22:33.145 --> 22:35.147
Oh, shit, is it that obvious?

22:35.230 --> 22:38.483
What...
Oh, well, I have nothing to hide.

22:38.566 --> 22:40.402
No shame here.

22:40.485 --> 22:44.239
Yes, we did drugs, and we had ourselves
a threesome, right there.

22:47.450 --> 22:50.370
Wow. Um, that's, um...

22:50.453 --> 22:51.704
I wish I didn't know that.

22:51.788 --> 22:54.958
Well, you know, people are always trying
to desexualize women my age,

22:55.042 --> 22:57.002
and I... I just won't allow it.

22:58.086 --> 22:59.254
Good for you.

23:00.380 --> 23:02.465
But actually, I came to ask about...

23:02.549 --> 23:06.428
Look, I still got some time left here,
but I'm getting out eventually.

23:06.511 --> 23:09.306
And it feels like it's time to start
focusing on that.

23:09.389 --> 23:11.766
Make sure I have a plan.

23:11.849 --> 23:15.353
And I really liked helping
you in class, Mrs. King.

23:16.521 --> 23:19.107
You've taught me a lot, and I...

23:19.191 --> 23:21.734
I was wondering, do you think
I could do this?

23:21.818 --> 23:22.819
Like, for real?

23:22.945 --> 23:24.321
Like, uh...

23:24.404 --> 23:26.448
You know, I'm not above anything.

23:26.531 --> 23:28.200
Like, I could start washing dishes,
in the kitchen...

23:28.283 --> 23:30.452
- I thought maybe you might have a friend...
- Hey, look, look.

23:30.994 --> 23:34.372
You call me when you get out,
I'm gonna find you a job.

23:34.456 --> 23:37.750
Now, I know a lot of chefs,
and they would be lucky to have you.

23:37.834 --> 23:39.962
- For real?
- Mmm.

23:40.045 --> 23:42.130
Now, this here is my office number.

23:42.214 --> 23:44.924
This is the real one,
not the bullshit one that I give out,

23:45.008 --> 23:46.259
and it goes to the PR people.

23:46.343 --> 23:49.387
There you go. You give that a call,
ask for Galen, my assistant,

23:49.471 --> 23:52.765
and we will, as the kids say,
"hook you up."

23:55.310 --> 23:57.937
Sorry, forgot my seltzer.

24:01.316 --> 24:05.320
You know... all that yoga
she supposedly does,

24:05.403 --> 24:07.155
she is not all that flexible.

24:07.239 --> 24:09.366
Couldn't get her foot behind her head.

24:22.712 --> 24:24.131
You're here.

24:25.132 --> 24:26.299
Am I?

24:27.592 --> 24:28.885
I guess you could be a ghost,

24:28.968 --> 24:32.097
but in that case, I hope you
look a little better than you do now.

24:34.141 --> 24:36.351
Well... welcome back.

24:38.436 --> 24:39.562
You need anything?

24:39.646 --> 24:44.067
Don't make the mistake of thinking
just 'cause I look weak, I am.

24:45.027 --> 24:46.778
Get the fuck out of my face.

24:58.498 --> 24:59.999
Oh, what the fuck is she doing here?

25:00.083 --> 25:03.503
Ladies, I would like you to meet
my new shadow, Pennsatucky.

25:03.586 --> 25:04.796
Oh.

25:04.879 --> 25:06.714
Gave her my basket to puke in.

25:06.798 --> 25:10.177
Yeah. See, loyalty,
counts for something.

25:10.260 --> 25:11.594
Ain't that the truth.

25:11.678 --> 25:15.348
Tell me, is it more important
than self-respect?

25:15.432 --> 25:18.518
Ah, man, look at us.
Bickering like a real family.

25:18.601 --> 25:20.395
I mean, it's comforting, actually.

25:22.522 --> 25:25.108
You all right, Red?
You wanna take my seat?

25:25.192 --> 25:26.984
Yeah, your color doesn't look so good.

25:27.069 --> 25:29.362
Don't treat me like an old lady.
I'm fine.

25:30.738 --> 25:32.449
You all right, inmate?

25:32.532 --> 25:34.117
You're looking a little weak.

25:36.619 --> 25:39.622
Fucking cock sucking motherfucker.

25:39.706 --> 25:41.040
Mouth, Chapman.

25:41.124 --> 25:43.501
No, what she said, it's right on.

25:43.585 --> 25:45.795
You guys know there's a movement afoot?

25:45.878 --> 25:47.547
Oh!

25:47.630 --> 25:50.300
Well, I'm very into detective work.

25:50.383 --> 25:52.009
Like Sherlock Holmes?

25:52.094 --> 25:55.388
Especially when the detective looks
like Benedict Cumberbatch.

25:55.472 --> 25:57.807
I know some people
think he looks part Mongoloid,

25:57.890 --> 26:01.186
but I think he's the hottest Holmes
since John.

26:01.269 --> 26:03.646
Have you even seen
the <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> that he's in?

26:03.730 --> 26:05.648
Oh, he's in all the magazines.

26:05.732 --> 26:08.860
You know, Sherlock's brother Mycroft
has a brain like a computer.

26:08.943 --> 26:11.863
Oh, cute.
I think you mean Microsoft.

26:11.946 --> 26:13.615
No, I don't.

26:14.407 --> 26:15.408
What is the movement?

26:15.492 --> 26:17.910
Uh, just a bunch of girls
trying to get him fired.

26:17.994 --> 26:20.955
It'll never work.
He's too big a fish.

26:21.038 --> 26:24.000
Now, a guard we can make happen.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.378
You know who we could lose?

26:26.461 --> 26:27.629
Donuts.

26:27.712 --> 26:31.048
Really? I mean, he seems like
one of the good ones.

26:31.133 --> 26:34.427
You wanna tell the girls why he doesn't
deserve to eat the shit out of my asshole?

26:34.511 --> 26:37.096
You know, I realize
it's all in the English,

26:37.180 --> 26:38.973
but I'm pretty sure
nobody deserves that.

26:39.056 --> 26:40.350
Yeah, just drop it.

26:41.184 --> 26:43.228
I'd help get Piscatella fired.

26:46.814 --> 26:47.940
We could do that.

26:48.024 --> 26:51.278
Remember this morning, when we decided
to keep things quiet for a while,

26:51.361 --> 26:53.238
and focus on colon health and soup?

26:53.321 --> 26:54.697
This is important.

26:54.781 --> 26:56.616
It doesn't matter.

26:56.699 --> 26:59.076
It fell apart before it even started.

27:02.747 --> 27:05.124
A peaceful protest is a great idea.

27:05.208 --> 27:06.293
I'm in.

27:06.376 --> 27:08.628
Ain't nothing to be in on, girl.

27:08.711 --> 27:10.713
Them ladies is crazy.

27:11.464 --> 27:13.132
Suzanne, you want a bite of food?

27:14.759 --> 27:15.968
What about your bread?

27:16.594 --> 27:18.346
I did a bad thing.

27:19.972 --> 27:21.974
Bad, bad, bad...

27:22.058 --> 27:24.811
Shit, they really fucked her up.

27:27.230 --> 27:29.274
If there were a thing, I'd be there.

27:29.357 --> 27:30.900
Mmm, me too.

27:30.983 --> 27:32.109
Y'all for real?

27:32.194 --> 27:33.653
Even I'd do it.

27:34.612 --> 27:35.822
Comes a time, people.

27:35.905 --> 27:37.907
Fight the power.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.659
You gotta fight the powers that be.

27:42.412 --> 27:44.080
What'd I try to tell you?

27:44.163 --> 27:46.791
If your skin is any darker
than a pair of white sneakers,

27:46.874 --> 27:48.167
there ain't no work ethic.

27:48.251 --> 27:49.794
Lazy fucks.

27:51.170 --> 27:55.300
So, it's like my nanna used to say,
"Fuckin' darkies."

27:55.383 --> 27:58.220
Actually, some of the ladies
seem pretty nice.

28:01.431 --> 28:03.475
I mean, for a bunch of mud bunnies
and spics.

28:04.851 --> 28:05.935
Yeah.

28:10.982 --> 28:12.734
So? It's a no go?

28:12.817 --> 28:14.694
Are you crazy?

28:14.777 --> 28:17.905
Those hillbillies aren't trustworthy.

28:17.989 --> 28:20.575
No way are we working with them.

28:21.701 --> 28:23.077
We don't need them.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.496
Hey!

28:24.579 --> 28:25.580
We got enough people,

28:25.663 --> 28:27.039
let's do it ourselves.

28:27.123 --> 28:29.125
You want to put your ass on the line?

28:29.208 --> 28:30.418
Fine. Be my guest.

28:30.502 --> 28:32.920
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

28:33.004 --> 28:34.839
You saw what they did to me.

28:34.922 --> 28:37.008
Shit, forget about me, what about you?

28:45.475 --> 28:48.603
The Bureau will need a full review
of your hiring practices.

28:50.438 --> 28:52.106
That's necessary?

28:52.189 --> 28:54.401
The deceased officer had
four different social security numbers

28:54.484 --> 28:55.818
attributed to his name...

28:55.902 --> 28:57.695
We have no idea who this guy really was.

28:57.779 --> 28:59.071
What a nightmare, huh?

28:59.155 --> 29:00.782
For you? Absolutely.

29:02.284 --> 29:04.286
I'm gonna step out for a bit.

29:10.333 --> 29:13.002
Mr. Caputo,
did you hear about last night?

29:13.085 --> 29:16.130
The white girl is all kind of messed up
and Crazy is even crazier!

29:16.213 --> 29:18.591
- I did.
- Then what you gonna do about it?

29:18.675 --> 29:22.804
There are things that happen
on an administrative level, Jefferson...

29:22.887 --> 29:25.097
that are complicated.

29:26.433 --> 29:28.768
One of the guards did this.

29:28.851 --> 29:30.312
It still works, but it ain't pretty.

29:30.395 --> 29:32.314
And don't make my ass
point out the metaphor.

29:32.397 --> 29:35.149
I am working on it.
These things take time, okay?

29:35.232 --> 29:36.818
Mmm-hmm.

29:46.077 --> 29:47.829
Hey, uh, let me get that for you.

29:47.912 --> 29:49.539
- Thank you.
- No problem.

29:49.622 --> 29:51.833
Bayley. A word.

29:53.543 --> 29:56.838
Sir, you didn't tell anyone
it was me who told you, right?

29:56.921 --> 29:58.214
Why are you here?

29:58.298 --> 30:00.091
Uh, it's my shift, sir.

30:00.174 --> 30:02.844
No, I mean, why do you work here?

30:03.761 --> 30:07.056
I don't know, it's a job until
I figure out the next thing, I guess.

30:07.139 --> 30:08.433
Listen to me.

30:08.516 --> 30:11.978
This... isn't for someone like you.

30:12.937 --> 30:16.441
This... this place crushes anything good.

30:16.524 --> 30:18.735
It's like a...

30:18.818 --> 30:23.448
monster that's grown too big
for its stubby little legs,

30:23.531 --> 30:24.991
and now it's...

30:25.074 --> 30:28.911
stumbling around, crushing whole cities.

30:28.995 --> 30:30.830
You can't survive it, Bayley.

30:33.916 --> 30:36.753
Are you the city or the monster, sir?

30:36.836 --> 30:38.087
Neither.

30:39.714 --> 30:41.007
Both, I...

30:42.550 --> 30:46.012
Even if you're the city now...
one day you'll be the monster.

30:47.179 --> 30:50.182
Working here... changes who you are.

30:50.266 --> 30:51.934
You understand me?

30:53.102 --> 30:54.228
I think so?

30:55.021 --> 30:58.065
I'm stuck here, you're young.

30:59.066 --> 31:00.276
Get outta here.

31:04.864 --> 31:06.282
Go travel.

31:06.366 --> 31:07.992
Go back to school.

31:08.075 --> 31:09.243
Go work in Home Depot.

31:09.326 --> 31:11.203
Anything...

31:11.287 --> 31:12.705
but here.

31:12.789 --> 31:14.957
- You're leaving?
- I need some air.

31:24.842 --> 31:25.968
<i>Here you go.</i>

31:27.261 --> 31:30.306
Yeah, we have a cute-girl-free-cone
promotion going on right now.

31:30.390 --> 31:31.433
Thank you.

31:35.144 --> 31:37.104
Hey, you wanna come sit with us?

31:37.188 --> 31:38.690
Uh... No, I'm good, thanks.

31:38.773 --> 31:39.982
You're hot!

31:42.402 --> 31:44.361
- "You're hot"?
- I'm trying.

31:44.446 --> 31:45.905
My mom says it's all that matters.

31:45.988 --> 31:48.491
Hey, guys,
I'm practically setting them up for you.

31:48.575 --> 31:50.577
Yeah, well, look at
what I'm working with here, so...

31:50.660 --> 31:51.869
I'm trying to respect women.

31:51.953 --> 31:53.287
What are we doing tonight?

31:53.370 --> 31:55.164
Lisa Przyborski's having that party.

31:55.247 --> 31:57.584
- So, pregame at the water tower?
- Fuck, yeah!

31:57.667 --> 32:00.044
Baxter, can I talk to you?

32:00.127 --> 32:02.088
Ah, somebody's in trouble.

32:02.171 --> 32:04.298
"Someone's in trouble."

32:06.634 --> 32:08.094
What up, boss-man?

32:08.177 --> 32:09.429
You're fired.

32:09.512 --> 32:11.305
What? Why?

32:11.388 --> 32:14.809
Because, you've been stealing.
We caught you on the cameras.

32:14.892 --> 32:18.187
You've been giving away more than $30
worth of free ice cream every day.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.523
Anytime a cute girl walks up,
she doesn't pay.

32:20.607 --> 32:23.443
I mean, that's not technically stealing,
is it?

32:23.526 --> 32:25.987
Tom's been struggling
to keep this place open for years.

32:26.070 --> 32:29.699
So, yeah, dumbass,
30 bucks a day in losses is stealing.

32:29.782 --> 32:31.493
But, since it doesn't seem
to matter to you,

32:31.576 --> 32:33.536
we'll go ahead and keep this week's pay.

32:35.079 --> 32:36.372
I didn't know there were cameras.

32:36.456 --> 32:38.583
Not even a fucking apology from you.

32:38.666 --> 32:39.959
Jesus!

32:40.042 --> 32:41.836
You millennials really are the worst.

32:41.919 --> 32:43.045
Get the hell outta here.

32:44.296 --> 32:45.465
Sorry.

32:50.011 --> 32:51.053
Hey, guys?

32:51.804 --> 32:54.140
Uh, so I just got fired.

32:54.223 --> 32:55.600
Oh, shoot.

32:56.768 --> 32:58.645
So I guess pregaming starts early!

32:58.728 --> 33:00.980
Yeah, it does.
Let's go.

33:08.905 --> 33:11.908
Is this like that thing that anorexics do,

33:11.991 --> 33:13.910
where they get jealous
that other people are skinny,

33:13.993 --> 33:15.327
and they try to make 'em fat?

33:16.162 --> 33:19.582
You know, my whole life, people said,
"Penns, you're so fucked up."

33:19.666 --> 33:21.668
But I'm starting to think

33:21.751 --> 33:23.795
that you're winning this race.

33:24.504 --> 33:28.675
If this is supposed to be a peace accord,
you're off to a fucking terrible start.

33:40.477 --> 33:42.188
Oh, and now you're eating my gift.

33:46.400 --> 33:49.612
- I miss you.
- So?

33:49.696 --> 33:52.532
So, I've been reading.

33:52.615 --> 33:56.243
Yeah, I read. Ever since you've been
putting all that shit in my brain.

33:58.996 --> 34:01.457
Do you know the difference
between pain and suffering?

34:01.541 --> 34:03.292
Oh, I can't wait to hear this.

34:03.375 --> 34:06.462
Yeah, well, you should hear it,
because pain is something that...

34:08.297 --> 34:12.677
Pain is always there,
because life is freaking painful, okay?

34:17.014 --> 34:19.684
But suffering is a choice.

34:23.312 --> 34:25.063
And, you, my friend...

34:26.608 --> 34:29.443
It's not my right to say,
but you're suffering.

34:34.782 --> 34:37.744
Suffering Sam, that's you.

34:38.620 --> 34:42.289
Exactly what self-help bullshit
have you been reading?

34:42.373 --> 34:46.085
Hey, I'm here to say that I've been
brushing up on the Holy Bible.

34:46.168 --> 34:48.337
Oh, Jesus...
Literally.

34:48.420 --> 34:49.755
But it's not even like that.

34:49.839 --> 34:52.634
Like, there's so much
useful stuff in the Bible.

34:53.676 --> 34:54.927
There really is.

34:56.344 --> 34:58.681
Especially about forgiveness.

35:02.351 --> 35:03.560
Forgiveness.

35:06.856 --> 35:08.775
You need to move on, Boo.

35:09.651 --> 35:11.402
Oh, I need to move on?

35:11.485 --> 35:12.569
Yes.

35:14.363 --> 35:16.073
Yes, ma'am, you do.

35:17.909 --> 35:19.535
'Cause...

35:20.452 --> 35:21.996
I forgave him.

35:22.079 --> 35:24.040
And you know what?

35:24.123 --> 35:27.251
It ain't about him.
I forgave him for me.

35:29.921 --> 35:33.549
And I think that you're capable
of doing something like that.

35:33.633 --> 35:36.928
Especially seeing that nothing
happened to you, you big turd!

35:37.011 --> 35:39.847
Ow!

35:39.931 --> 35:41.307
So, come on.

35:43.142 --> 35:44.686
Freaking move on.

35:45.937 --> 35:47.772
Let's just be friends again.

35:47.855 --> 35:52.318
We can eat candy, we could teach
each other stuff about stuff, like we did.

35:55.279 --> 35:57.114
I miss you.

35:58.950 --> 36:00.117
You hitting on me?

36:00.201 --> 36:01.828
No!

36:01.911 --> 36:03.162
But you wish.

36:05.707 --> 36:07.624
You know,
the problem with the hunger strike

36:07.709 --> 36:09.501
was that we weren't focused.

36:09.585 --> 36:12.088
But that's why this is so great
and could totally be successful.

36:12.171 --> 36:14.841
We just have to, like,
clearly state to the administration

36:14.924 --> 36:16.050
what it is we want...

36:17.009 --> 36:18.469
Judy King offered me a job.

36:19.261 --> 36:21.055
She did?

36:21.138 --> 36:22.514
Yeah, she said to call her
when I get out of here,

36:22.598 --> 36:24.141
and she'll hook me up.

36:24.225 --> 36:26.310
She said any chef
would be lucky to have me.

36:26.393 --> 36:29.313
Baby, I'm so proud of you.

36:29.396 --> 36:31.190
One step closer to that apartment.

36:31.273 --> 36:33.442
Then Fiji.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.737
We'll just have to take down
the prison administration first,

36:35.820 --> 36:37.571
and then we'll be able
to take over the world.

36:37.654 --> 36:39.991
Wait, you don't think that protest
is going to work, do you?

36:40.700 --> 36:42.659
Of course, I do.
Why wouldn't I?

36:42.744 --> 36:44.370
I don't know,
you're excited to have a project.

36:44.453 --> 36:47.539
A project? This isn't knitting.

36:47.623 --> 36:50.334
This is social change and justice.
It's important.

36:50.417 --> 36:52.754
Absolutely, it just ain't gonna
happen in this place.

36:53.713 --> 36:55.506
Well, I'm not willing to not try.

36:55.589 --> 36:58.175
Brook, this isn't important, okay?

36:58.259 --> 37:00.762
Over there, outside all of this.
That's what's important.

37:00.845 --> 37:04.015
Why waste your energy trying to get
some dude who don't even matter fired,

37:04.098 --> 37:06.893
when they're gonna hire some other guy
tomorrow who'll probably be worse?

37:06.976 --> 37:09.937
You're telling me
what I care about doesn't matter.

37:10.021 --> 37:13.775
I'm telling you...
your privilege makes you naive, babe.

37:15.401 --> 37:18.404
I'd rather be naive than a selfish,
jaded asshole.

37:19.280 --> 37:20.281
Baby.

37:20.364 --> 37:21.949
- Hey.
- Leave me alone.

37:25.995 --> 37:28.873
You said it would be last Friday,
all right?

37:28.956 --> 37:31.167
I sat around here waiting all day,

37:31.250 --> 37:34.670
practicing my surprise face
for when the CO finally showed up,

37:34.754 --> 37:36.505
and then... nothing!

37:38.340 --> 37:40.467
I did closure things.

37:43.262 --> 37:46.974
"What do I expect"?
Oh, look. What I expect...

37:47.058 --> 37:50.227
is that my lawyer,
when he tells me that I am...

37:50.311 --> 37:53.272
getting out of this hellhole
on a certain day,

37:53.355 --> 37:54.648
that it is a done deal.

37:55.566 --> 38:00.863
I cannot imagine that is too much to ask
from someone that I pay $1,800 an hour.

38:02.782 --> 38:06.118
Well... try harder then, sugar!

38:06.202 --> 38:08.745
Baby, is everything okay with us?

38:09.914 --> 38:14.210
Well, I don't know, it seems like
you've been very busy lately.

38:14.293 --> 38:17.713
<i>Look, I'm so sorry</i>
<i>I missed visitation, my bride.</i>

38:17.797 --> 38:20.424
But it was Paulie's birthday,
and he really wanted me there,

38:20.507 --> 38:23.052
and I had to go,
'cause it was the big 3-0, you know.

38:23.135 --> 38:25.387
And we ain't kids no more, Lorna.

38:25.471 --> 38:26.722
Thirty is, like, serious.

38:26.806 --> 38:30.101
<i>We even drank bourbon instead of beer.</i>

38:30.184 --> 38:33.645
Well, I missed you... a lot.

38:33.729 --> 38:36.232
A lot, a lot.

38:36.315 --> 38:38.025
Who is this, uh, Paulie, then?

38:38.109 --> 38:39.110
Oh, you know Paulie.

38:39.193 --> 38:41.487
Paulie, my, uh, buddy I grew up with
from down the street.

38:41.570 --> 38:44.781
Oh! Oh, the one whose eye
goes left instead of right?

38:44.866 --> 38:47.659
No, no, no, that's Greggy.
Paulie is the dental hygienist.

38:47.743 --> 38:49.661
<i>His eyes are normal.</i>

38:49.745 --> 38:51.998
- I don't think I know him.
<i>- You'd love him.</i>

38:52.081 --> 38:54.917
Except sometimes, you know,
he can get a little, uh, uptight,

38:55.001 --> 38:56.793
<i>uh, when he sees you chewing</i>
<i>something tough</i>

38:56.878 --> 38:59.630
<i>like a caramel, like a taffy...</i>

38:59.713 --> 39:01.507
A caramel?

39:01.590 --> 39:02.842
You like caramels now?

39:02.925 --> 39:05.594
Yeah, sure.
Not any more than before, though.

39:05.677 --> 39:08.389
<i>I think my favorites are still</i>
<i>candy corn pumpkins.</i>

39:08.472 --> 39:10.057
But, caramels?

39:12.184 --> 39:14.228
I... I don't think
I understand the question.

39:15.980 --> 39:20.526
You know who else loves caramels?

39:20.609 --> 39:21.861
Francine.

39:22.778 --> 39:26.282
Okay, well, I guess I will jot that down
in my "Facts about Francine" notebook.

39:26.365 --> 39:30.036
<i>Um, anyway, my love,</i>

39:30.119 --> 39:32.704
<i>you remember that, um,</i>
<i>homeless guy I was telling you about</i>

39:32.788 --> 39:36.083
<i>who sucks on cotton balls?</i>
<i>We all call him Hobo Marshmallows...</i>

39:36.167 --> 39:37.751
I'm not stupid, you know.

39:37.834 --> 39:39.962
I've known for weeks.

39:40.046 --> 39:43.132
You're not pulling any wool
over these eyes. No, sir.

39:44.341 --> 39:46.552
I have no fucking idea
what you're talking about.

39:46.635 --> 39:50.681
I'm talking about you
pulling your dick out of your pants

39:50.764 --> 39:53.350
and sticking it in my sister!

39:53.434 --> 39:55.852
What? She said you told her
to hang out with me,

39:55.937 --> 39:57.313
that you want us to be a family.

39:57.396 --> 39:58.981
Well, believe me,

39:59.065 --> 40:03.402
I wouldn't have asked her to do that
if I knew she was a whore!

40:03.485 --> 40:06.530
I, uh... Wait.

40:07.573 --> 40:09.658
You really think
I would do that to you, Lorna?

40:09.741 --> 40:12.203
I don't know what you're capable of,

40:12.286 --> 40:16.373
you lying cheater, bourbon drinker,
caramel eater...

40:18.292 --> 40:19.585
Oh, my God!

40:21.212 --> 40:22.838
Oh, my God, you're crazy.

40:22.922 --> 40:25.091
No, no, no, no, no.

40:25.174 --> 40:27.426
Don't you dare do that.

40:27.509 --> 40:31.763
You're manipulatin' the conversation,
I know... I know this trick.

40:31.847 --> 40:35.101
This ain't about me.
I'm not the crazy one.

40:35.184 --> 40:36.768
I know what I know.

40:36.852 --> 40:40.147
And you, Vincent Muccio...

40:40.231 --> 40:43.150
are not a good man.

40:49.823 --> 40:51.783
Sorry, sweaty hands.

40:59.791 --> 41:01.918
Oh, you're here.
Thank God!

41:05.547 --> 41:07.466
Once again, I have a favor to ask.

41:07.549 --> 41:11.262
I know, I ask and I ask,
and here I am again.

41:11.345 --> 41:14.515
Think of me as your prison psoriasis.

41:17.268 --> 41:20.604
Can I take a nap in here, Sam? Please?

41:20.687 --> 41:24.941
That fucking Piscatella won't let me sleep
and my vision is getting blurry.

41:26.360 --> 41:27.694
I'm sorry to hear that.

41:30.864 --> 41:32.158
Sam, what's wrong?

41:36.620 --> 41:39.956
Red... when did you get here?

41:41.542 --> 41:42.668
Look at me.

41:44.003 --> 41:45.837
I don't know what's going on with you,

41:45.921 --> 41:48.090
but you need to get yourself together.

41:48.174 --> 41:49.175
You hear me?

41:49.258 --> 41:53.012
This is no time
to feel sorry for yourself.

41:53.095 --> 41:56.182
Go home, take a shower,
and get back here.

41:57.099 --> 41:59.768
You have a home,
so it can't be that bad.

42:00.727 --> 42:03.397
You don't get to have a crisis right now.

42:03.480 --> 42:06.442
We need you, understand?

42:06.525 --> 42:09.570
Okay. I'll go home.

42:26.378 --> 42:27.504
Okay.

42:28.505 --> 42:30.299
We'll sit here then.

42:48.192 --> 42:49.943
So I guess I know what that's about.

42:51.027 --> 42:52.154
We good now?

42:52.238 --> 42:54.030
Oh, yeah, we're good,
because she's good.

42:54.115 --> 42:57.368
But if you ever hurt her again, I mean
if you even so much as hurt her feelings,

42:57.451 --> 42:58.994
you're fucking dead.

42:59.078 --> 43:01.872
- I mean it, literally, dead.
- Got it.

43:01.955 --> 43:04.708
You are still a rapist in my book.

43:04.791 --> 43:06.585
You didn't fuck up,
you didn't make a mistake.

43:06.668 --> 43:08.170
You're a fucking rapist!

43:09.796 --> 43:13.008
Oh, your ass looks
really great naked, by the way.

43:33.779 --> 43:36.657
I guess this is how we hold hands.

43:36.740 --> 43:39.285
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too, Pipes.

43:40.911 --> 43:43.830
But this you, not the other
galvanized-lunatic you.

43:43.914 --> 43:45.832
I love it when you talk dirty.

43:49.586 --> 43:51.672
You got chips on your face.

43:54.049 --> 43:55.676
I hope she does that...

43:55.759 --> 43:57.469
again!

43:58.762 --> 44:00.556
We should really start charging.

44:01.890 --> 44:05.144
Hey! You owe us a dollar.

44:06.019 --> 44:07.521
Four dollars!

44:07.604 --> 44:09.815
One dollar per titty!

44:09.898 --> 44:10.941
That's the rate!

44:11.024 --> 44:13.610
I hate prison.

44:13.694 --> 44:16.655
Oh, my God, two dollars per vagina.

44:16.738 --> 44:18.324
It's extra money for vagina.

44:30.419 --> 44:31.503
I need a brush.

44:36.217 --> 44:37.426
Come on.

44:39.303 --> 44:42.055
Okay, ladies, play time is over.

44:42.138 --> 44:44.391
This ain't play time, it's business.

44:44.475 --> 44:46.142
Well, lucky for us,

44:46.227 --> 44:47.769
that we could all have
different definitions

44:47.853 --> 44:49.730
for whatever the hell it is
that you do in here.

44:49.813 --> 44:51.565
'Cause it's America.
Out!

44:52.691 --> 44:56.194
And if you got a problem, or you,
or you...

44:56.278 --> 44:58.697
you could tell Maria
to come and talk to me later.

44:58.780 --> 45:00.366
All right?

45:04.160 --> 45:07.289
Respect your elders,
and get the fuck out!

45:16.089 --> 45:18.675
And you, don't do nothing stupid.
You hear me?

45:19.593 --> 45:21.845
- You don't scare me.
- Then you're dumber than you look.

45:41.698 --> 45:42.949
All right.

45:43.909 --> 45:45.702
What are we gonna do here?

45:46.870 --> 45:49.665
I don't know
if it's still in good shape.

45:49.748 --> 45:51.041
Well, let's see.

45:51.958 --> 45:56.004
Maybe we...
need some brush or something.

45:56.922 --> 45:58.965
Uh, they used to be
in the drawer over there.

46:08.809 --> 46:09.976
I don't need your pity.

46:10.727 --> 46:11.853
Good.

46:11.937 --> 46:13.522
'Cause I ain't got none to give.

46:19.945 --> 46:21.237
Should we try this?

47:10.704 --> 47:11.913
Hey, man.

47:13.457 --> 47:15.000
Hey.

47:15.083 --> 47:17.293
I thought this was my secret lunch spot.

47:18.587 --> 47:19.713
Guess not.

47:21.423 --> 47:22.758
You all right?

47:26.094 --> 47:27.262
Cool if I sit?

47:40.984 --> 47:42.903
It's crazy shit out there, huh?

47:44.530 --> 47:45.572
Yeah.

47:47.115 --> 47:48.992
What's up with you?

47:52.120 --> 47:53.997
Do you think this place changes you?

47:56.667 --> 47:59.753
Like, in general?
Or me, personally?

48:00.879 --> 48:02.506
You, personally?

48:04.925 --> 48:06.301
Not that I noticed.

48:07.928 --> 48:09.179
Just a job, right?

48:10.013 --> 48:12.641
I almost got a hand job from an inmate.

48:12.724 --> 48:16.186
And I was part of an illegal
panty-smuggling scheme.

48:16.269 --> 48:17.604
No shit.

48:18.313 --> 48:19.481
It's not funny.

48:19.565 --> 48:20.649
Nah.

48:21.942 --> 48:23.569
Of course.

48:23.652 --> 48:24.945
Yeah, I just...

48:26.196 --> 48:28.031
Coming from you, you know.

48:29.157 --> 48:30.867
So you've never been tempted?

48:32.994 --> 48:34.037
Nah.

48:35.246 --> 48:36.873
Can't say that I have.

48:38.792 --> 48:40.251
Sorry, buddy.

48:45.507 --> 48:47.217
Hey, hey, hey.
This is the one.

48:48.552 --> 48:49.803
Right here.

48:49.886 --> 48:51.387
Let it rip, Bax.

48:57.769 --> 49:01.482
Come on, do another!
Let that asswipe have it.

49:01.565 --> 49:03.525
No one fires Baxter Bayley.

49:03.609 --> 49:06.402
Yeah, no one fires Baxter Bayley!

49:07.863 --> 49:10.406
You guys think the third-person thing
works for me?

49:10.491 --> 49:13.159
Dude, throw it!
Yeah, come on!

49:17.789 --> 49:19.541
You guys, a car's coming.

49:19.625 --> 49:20.834
Shit.

49:23.003 --> 49:24.630
What are we gonna do
with the rest of them?

49:24.713 --> 49:26.172
Well, we ain't making omelets.

49:37.392 --> 49:39.310
Oh, jackpot.

49:39.394 --> 49:42.063
Dude, don't get too close.
They might murder us or something.

49:42.147 --> 49:43.231
Dude, is everyone armed?

49:43.314 --> 49:47.318
On my count.
One, two, three!

49:49.404 --> 49:50.488
You nailed her!

49:50.572 --> 49:52.198
You think that's funny?

49:52.282 --> 49:55.118
You redneck piece of shit asshole!

49:55.201 --> 49:57.245
I'm a fucking human being!

50:02.543 --> 50:05.754
Yeah, boys.
Cheers, boys. Let's go.

50:23.939 --> 50:25.065
We don't want any.

50:30.654 --> 50:34.157
Hey, Beer Can, or Wine Glass,
as the case may be.

50:34.908 --> 50:37.619
- Are you drunk?
- Why, you want to take advantage of me?

50:37.703 --> 50:38.870
Come in.

50:40.664 --> 50:43.625
I shouldn't stay.
I just wanted to say that...

50:45.961 --> 50:47.170
I'm sorry.

50:47.963 --> 50:50.173
This is an impossible job.

50:50.757 --> 50:52.968
You were trying,
and I shouldn't have judged you.

50:54.260 --> 50:55.679
They broke you, too, huh?

50:58.514 --> 51:00.225
I guess.

51:00.308 --> 51:01.392
Come on.

51:02.686 --> 51:05.856
Have a glass of wine with me, for...
old time's sake.

51:08.316 --> 51:11.569
I should really be getting back.
Things are a little chaotic right now.

51:11.653 --> 51:13.154
Right.

51:13.238 --> 51:15.991
You're probably busy prepping for
all those new bodies headed your way.

51:16.074 --> 51:19.285
- They've been there for months.
- No, I mean the next round.

51:19.369 --> 51:21.830
The ones who will fill
that superdorm you're building.

51:21.913 --> 51:24.124
I'm tight with Margie
from Infrastructure at MCC,

51:24.207 --> 51:25.583
she was telling me all about it.

51:25.667 --> 51:28.586
What a shit show.
I'm sorry that mess fell in your lap.

51:29.713 --> 51:30.922
More inmates?

51:32.048 --> 51:35.426
Come on, Joe, you didn't know
that they were trying to stuff that place

51:35.510 --> 51:37.178
with as many bodies as it could hold?

51:37.262 --> 51:39.347
Fuckers!

51:41.850 --> 51:44.144
You sure you don't wanna come in?

51:45.353 --> 51:46.772
I have a girlfriend.

51:47.773 --> 51:52.235
A weird, lying, gun-toting,
manipulative, corporate girlfriend.

51:52.318 --> 51:54.529
Margie from Infrastructure told me.

51:56.114 --> 51:57.407
Come on.

51:57.490 --> 52:00.076
We'll just... talk.

52:01.536 --> 52:03.038
I'm a really great talker.

52:03.747 --> 52:05.331
Talking...

52:05.415 --> 52:06.541
Talking sounds nice.

52:12.172 --> 52:15.091
- Did you get your hubby on the phone?
- Oh, sure.

52:15.175 --> 52:17.803
Yeah, it was great, just great.

52:17.886 --> 52:20.638
- I don't want you guys to go judging...
- Yeah.

52:20.722 --> 52:23.224
...'cause we know it's fast, but...

52:24.225 --> 52:26.853
we're gonna start trying to have a baby.

52:26.937 --> 52:28.188
Small thing, but isn't that, uh,

52:28.271 --> 52:31.817
isn't that going to be hard, considering
penis in vagina needs to happen?

52:31.900 --> 52:33.151
Mmm-hmm.

52:33.234 --> 52:34.695
Love will find a way.

52:35.987 --> 52:37.823
Come here.

52:37.906 --> 52:39.407
It sure will, kid.

52:44.079 --> 52:45.496
- I saw that.
- What?

52:45.580 --> 52:47.248
God save us all.

52:47.332 --> 52:48.374
You're fucking again.

52:48.458 --> 52:49.918
No, we're just...

52:50.001 --> 52:51.544
- Companions.
- Yeah.

52:51.627 --> 52:52.628
Companions.

52:52.713 --> 52:54.380
"Companions,"
that's what they're called.

52:54.464 --> 52:56.174
- Oh, you guys...
- Yo, yo.

53:03.139 --> 53:05.141
Inmate!

53:06.601 --> 53:08.269
Please...

53:08.353 --> 53:10.939
let me sleep for 20 minutes.

53:11.022 --> 53:12.899
This is inhumane.

53:12.983 --> 53:15.736
Prison wasn't built on humanity, inmate.

53:21.950 --> 53:23.076
Listen up!

53:25.245 --> 53:27.998
Things have been pretty lax around here,
if you ask me.

53:28.790 --> 53:31.501
So lax, in fact, that one of my men

53:31.584 --> 53:34.462
was murdered on prison property
by one of you.

53:35.213 --> 53:37.548
It seems that, somewhere along the way,

53:37.632 --> 53:40.385
everyone around here forgot
the only thing that matters.

53:40.468 --> 53:43.346
You're criminals, and you deserve nothing.

53:43.429 --> 53:47.225
And if I have to make an example
out of each and every one of you

53:47.308 --> 53:49.019
to get this place back in order...

53:50.228 --> 53:51.813
well, that will be my pleasure.

53:53.356 --> 53:54.565
Get to work.

53:57.027 --> 53:59.612
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Stay out of this, inmate.

53:59.695 --> 54:02.615
- I'm all right.
- 'Course you are.

54:03.699 --> 54:06.536
Make sure she starts working.
Don't let her sit down.

55:09.515 --> 55:10.892
Come on, fuck this!

55:25.656 --> 55:27.492
- Hey, should we call for backup?
- Mmm-mmm.

55:30.120 --> 55:31.704
I'm sorry, baby.

55:40.505 --> 55:43.466
We are not going to move
until you no longer work at this prison.

55:43.549 --> 55:45.718
Yeah.

55:45.801 --> 55:48.263
We need backup in the cafeteria, now!

55:48.346 --> 55:49.805
Every man we have.

55:49.890 --> 55:52.017
We're not going to do anything
other than stand here.

55:52.100 --> 55:54.769
You don't need more men,
you just need to resign.

56:16.582 --> 56:18.584
- Start clearing.
- Yes, sir.

56:18.668 --> 56:20.461
- Clear 'em off.
- Come on, get down!

56:20.545 --> 56:22.755
- No, no, no...
- Hey! Get down.

56:22.838 --> 56:24.215
No, I did a bad thing!

56:24.299 --> 56:26.426
I did a bad thing! I did a bad thing!
I did a bad thing!

56:26.509 --> 56:28.219
I did a bad thing!

56:29.762 --> 56:31.722
- Get down!
- I did a bad thing!

56:31.806 --> 56:33.849
I did a bad thing.

56:33.934 --> 56:37.062
I did a bad... Bad! Bad! Bad!

56:37.145 --> 56:40.398
Bayley! Get that fucking animal
out of here, now. Get her to Psych!

56:40.481 --> 56:42.067
Bad! Bad! Bad! Bad!

56:42.150 --> 56:43.276
- No, no, no.
- Bad! Bad!

56:43.359 --> 56:45.028
- Hey, no, don't. Just let me talk to her!
- Bad! Bad! Bad!

56:45.111 --> 56:48.031
- Hey! Stay down, inmate!
- No, come on, man, I'm trying to help.

56:48.114 --> 56:50.200
- She don't know what she's doing.
- Get off!

56:51.367 --> 56:54.245
- All right, let's get down.
- No. No!

56:54.329 --> 56:56.414
- Get down. Come on.
- I'm not doing...

56:57.123 --> 56:59.917
Oh, fuck, it hurts.

57:00.001 --> 57:01.711
Get your foot off me, man!

57:04.547 --> 57:05.840
Get off of me!

57:05.923 --> 57:07.717
Man, get off me!

57:14.557 --> 57:15.850
Calm down!

57:19.938 --> 57:22.440
Piscatella! Piscatella!

57:23.399 --> 57:24.442
Help me!

57:24.525 --> 57:30.740
I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm bad,
I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm bad!

57:30.823 --> 57:33.451
- Come on. Let's go, come on.
- Don't touch me, man!

57:35.954 --> 57:38.456
- P! P!
- Come on.

57:38.539 --> 57:40.541
I did a... I did a bad thing!

57:40.625 --> 57:45.255
I did a bad...
I did it! I did it!

57:45.338 --> 57:47.132
I did it!

57:58.768 --> 58:00.020
Someone call a medic.
