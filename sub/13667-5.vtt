wasn't from an aspirin bottle.

13:26.870 --> 13:29.606
I don't need this.
I've got enough of
a morale problem...

13:29.673 --> 13:31.675
without Dr. Chandler
Browbeating my nurses.

13:31.742 --> 13:35.245
Nurse skilling is incompetent.
You had no right
yelling at her in public.

13:35.312 --> 13:37.281
- You did what?
- I got angry.

13:37.347 --> 13:40.184
It was unnecessary
and disrespectful.
Disrespectful?

13:40.250 --> 13:43.754
Two of my patients died--
One after nurse Skilling is late
with a medication order.

13:43.821 --> 13:45.722
That didn't kill
mrs. Perez.
No, it didn't.

13:45.789 --> 13:48.292
Pneumonia did.
Same thing that killed
miss Rothlein this morning.

13:48.358 --> 13:50.761
Let's chalk that up
to contamination
during Intubation.

13:50.828 --> 13:55.165
Look, you cannot prove
nurse skilling had
anything to do with that.

13:56.533 --> 13:59.103
I don't have to.
The evaluation
speaks for itself.

13:59.169 --> 14:01.572
Helen, her performance
is deteriorating.

14:01.638 --> 14:03.574
What do you think?

14:03.640 --> 14:06.310
It's a lot Harder
working here.

14:06.376 --> 14:08.579
She's older.
Well, aren't we all?

14:08.645 --> 14:10.948
<i>[ westphall ] what do you
think we should do?
Let her go.</i>

14:11.014 --> 14:13.851
Just a minute.

14:13.917 --> 14:17.855
Eleanor skilling has been
a productive part of
this hospital for 20 years.

14:17.921 --> 14:20.691
You don't throw
trained personnel
like her away.

14:21.759 --> 14:23.694
Besides, we're
shorthanded as it is.

14:23.761 --> 14:26.430
We'll just end up
hiring her back through
some private registry...

14:26.497 --> 14:28.399
for more money
than We're paying her now.

14:31.735 --> 14:35.672
- Okay. Let's transfer her
to another floor.
- Thanks.

14:35.739 --> 14:38.475
<i>[ woman on P.A. ]

14:38.542 --> 14:41.378
<i>Dr. Ed Tyler,
Fifth floor operating.</i>

14:49.686 --> 14:51.855
So, I o-Open the refrigerator
to the blood bank...

14:51.922 --> 14:54.191
to check on a.B.-negative,
I find one pint,

14:54.258 --> 14:56.193
two yogurts
and a six-Pack.

14:56.260 --> 14:59.496
Have you tried
the red cross?
There's a city-Wide shortage.

14:59.563 --> 15:01.799
We're not exactly on the top
of their priority list.

15:01.865 --> 15:04.868
You got any ideas?
[ chuckles ]
not since breakfast.

15:04.935 --> 15:07.838
I'll call the RED cross again.
Maybe I'll have better luck.
Gotcha.

15:09.039 --> 15:11.442
Hi, Andy.
Hi, doc.

15:11.508 --> 15:15.946
The cops could have
done a cleaner job
digging out the bullet.

15:16.013 --> 15:19.116
<i>You're early, Mrs. Rodriguez.
It's what is known
as false Labor.</i>

15:19.183 --> 15:21.552
Well, I thought it was time,
but it's only my first Baby.

15:21.618 --> 15:24.655
It's hard to be sure.
Well, you're anxious.
It happens.

15:24.721 --> 15:28.192

15:34.164 --> 15:36.100
berto is late for work.

15:36.166 --> 15:38.402
And he's afraid
if he's late again,
he's gonna get fired.

15:38.469 --> 15:40.404
There are so many people
for these jobs.

15:40.471 --> 15:43.273
<i>He says that you'll give me
the voucher for the bus home.</i>

15:43.340 --> 15:45.342
Sure.
While he's at work,

15:45.409 --> 15:47.377
is there anyone
staying with you?

15:47.444 --> 15:50.547
Yeah. Mrs. Dejesus.
She comes over
every afternoon.

15:50.614 --> 15:55.552
Hey, she's pregnant too.
She's already got
four girls and one boy.

15:55.619 --> 15:58.222
<i>And her husband, of course,
wants a son this time.</i>

15:58.288 --> 16:00.891
<i>Six children, and I worry
about having one.</i>

16:00.958 --> 16:04.728
[ spanish ]
my husband says
I talk too much.

16:04.795 --> 16:07.231
Call me when
the contractions
start up again, okay?

16:07.297 --> 16:10.234
Okay. This time
I'll be sure.

16:10.300 --> 16:12.403
She over-Sliced
the French bread a little,

16:12.469 --> 16:14.438
you know, and got scared--
All the Blood.
Yeah.

16:14.505 --> 16:17.574
Know how she stopped
the bleeding?
Surprise me.

16:17.641 --> 16:20.577
A jar of coffee.
You had to see it
to believe it.

16:20.644 --> 16:23.113
A gash filled
with instant.

16:23.180 --> 16:27.618
I just started my surgical tour,
and I got called in to observe.

16:27.684 --> 16:31.922
There's this girl lying
on the table, and all she's
wearing is her Tan.

16:31.989 --> 16:35.826
Lot of jokes, right?
Oh, yeah.
They were going crazy.

16:35.893 --> 16:38.228
That bother you?
[ Exhales ]

16:38.295 --> 16:41.498
That's not the problem.
I can handle that okay.

16:42.833 --> 16:46.470
When they cut her across
the abdomen, I-- I got sick.

16:48.372 --> 16:53.210
Damn it. It--
it just made me so angry,

16:53.277 --> 16:55.412
like I wasn't
tough enough or something.

16:55.479 --> 16:58.282
Sometimes I feel like
I just don't belong here.

16:59.883 --> 17:02.653
I'm afraid medicine
is still a man's world.

17:02.719 --> 17:05.756
It's a lot better than
when I first came here.

17:05.823 --> 17:10.094
There were two
surgical dressing rooms--
Doctors and nurses.

17:10.160 --> 17:13.664
What did you do?
Well, I knew
I wasn't a nurse.

17:13.730 --> 17:16.767
I really shook
things up in there.

17:18.301 --> 17:20.938
I'm out of here.
I've got 36 hours
of r&R.

17:21.003 --> 17:23.707
Lucky you.
Where are you going?
Driving to pittsfield.

17:23.773 --> 17:26.109
Who's the lucky guy?
Guys.

17:26.175 --> 17:28.612
My father and Brother.
Haven't seen them in months.

17:30.013 --> 17:32.950

Yeah, yeah.
I'm fine.

17:35.419 --> 17:37.921
What about you, Fiscus?
How are you checking out?

17:37.988 --> 17:40.557
I'm not dying.
It's not in the program.
Right.

17:40.624 --> 17:43.794
Personally, I intend
to tattoo "D.N.R."...

17:43.861 --> 17:45.963
right across my chest
in red, white and blue.

17:46.029 --> 17:48.298
"Do not resuscitate."

17:48.365 --> 17:50.434

a massive coronary...

right after a steak,
a bottle of lafite
rothschild 1961,

17:55.739 --> 17:58.609
and bang--
right before the check.

to get him up.
Oh, the rack monster calls.

<i>No, I meant

Okay, then explain what
"Beating the spread" Means.
You promised.

What, are you gonna start
taking the other kids'
lunch money?

Only after you teach me
high-Low poker.

Yeah, next thing,
you're gonna want to know
how to pick up girls.

First, Nina's gonna
wanna quit her job

more mouths to feed.

Then the two-Door isn't

appreciate it if you would
keep the conversation moving...

24:51.321 --> 24:53.824
'cause I just shot off
All my ammunition.
Oh, Wayne--

24:53.891 --> 24:55.826
That'll do.

24:55.893 --> 24:59.329
This is the nicest thing
Anybody's done to me
in a long time, but I--

24:59.396 --> 25:01.598
It's okay, Cathy.
I understand.

25:01.665 --> 25:04.301
No, you don't.
That's just it.
Yes, I do, really.

25:04.368 --> 25:06.336
I really do.
Hit it, Mel!

25:06.403 --> 25:08.972
<i>â™ªâ™ª [ accordion ]</i>

25:11.675 --> 25:14.178
Oh, Wayne.

25:14.244 --> 25:16.313
I took his appendix out
a year ago.

25:16.380 --> 25:19.049
He owes me one.
Nice touch, huh?

25:23.987 --> 25:27.558
Dr. Fiscus,
you are terrific.

25:36.900 --> 25:39.903
I told them not to
schedule me this morning!

25:39.970 --> 25:42.740
I'm sorry, Dr. Craig.
Nobody told me.

25:42.806 --> 25:44.742
Good morning, Helen.
Hi, Donald.

25:44.808 --> 25:47.845
The lab just finished the workup
on the Thompson girl.
Oh, Good. Thanks.

25:50.047 --> 25:52.616
Hmm. Got yourself real Good
this morning, Donald.

25:52.683 --> 25:56.253
Not a real confidence builder
for the patient when
the doctor cuts Himself.

25:56.320 --> 25:59.656
Time to change the blade.
I did, but my daughter
decided to surprise me...

25:59.723 --> 26:01.658
by Shaving
her legs first.

26:01.725 --> 26:04.528
These days,
be thankful it wasn't
your son shaving his legs.

26:04.595 --> 26:07.631
Great looking suit, Mark.
Well, today's the big day.

26:07.698 --> 26:12.269
The annual Cushing
left anterior descending
ARTERIES society Luncheon.

26:12.336 --> 26:15.105
Surgeon of the year.
Congratulations.

26:15.172 --> 26:17.841
I know some people think
this sort of thing is amusing,

26:17.908 --> 26:19.910
but I'm proud of
my work.

26:19.977 --> 26:22.045
This award
is important to me.
Well, we're all proud.

26:22.112 --> 26:24.548
It has meaning for everyone
connected to st. Eligius.

26:24.615 --> 26:29.820
Thank you, Donald.
It's important for me to get
positive feedback from my peers.

26:29.887 --> 26:33.023
Sometimes I feel I'm not
too well liked around here.

26:33.090 --> 26:36.293
Oh, now, now, Donald.
It's all right.

26:36.360 --> 26:40.164
I'm not out to win
any popularity contest.

26:40.230 --> 26:43.767
The work's what's important,
not the recognition.
Absolutely right.

26:43.834 --> 26:46.336
Even though I should've
won last year.

26:46.403 --> 26:48.806
Now, I managed to make it
to the butterfly Finals.

26:48.872 --> 26:50.974
So believe me,
the pressure's really on.

26:51.041 --> 26:54.278
I mean, I win, dartmouth wins
the title. Right?
Right.

26:54.344 --> 26:58.816
All right.
On one side of me is
a guy from princeton,

26:58.882 --> 27:01.452
who could be a close
relative of flipper.

27:01.518 --> 27:04.054
And on the other side,
in this last Lane,

27:04.121 --> 27:07.791
is a guy from syracuse,
looks like he could swim
the atlantic underwater.

27:07.858 --> 27:11.395
I am so psyched,
I shaved my entire Body.

27:11.462 --> 27:14.565
Why?
You know, streamlined
for less resistance.

27:14.631 --> 27:17.367
What happened?
Are you ready for this?

27:17.434 --> 27:20.738
Two false starts.
Disqualified.

27:20.804 --> 27:22.806
I guess I was
a little too Psyched.

27:22.873 --> 27:25.242
Yeah. You shaved
your head too?

27:25.309 --> 27:28.779
Could not get a date
for six weeks.

27:38.355 --> 27:40.557
Would you like to
accompany me to
the Craig luncheon?

27:40.624 --> 27:43.761
You'll have to
brave it alone.
I found a new doctor.

27:43.827 --> 27:46.463
- Who?
- Me. And I'm feeling
better already.

27:46.530 --> 27:48.565
"Doctor, heal thyself."

27:48.632 --> 27:51.468
You know, Donald,
the hardest thing for me
to do when I was Younger...

27:51.535 --> 27:53.570
was to find time
to take off.

27:53.637 --> 27:55.639
It seemed to me
a doctor's work
was never done.

27:55.706 --> 27:57.708
There was always
another problem,
another patient.

27:57.775 --> 28:01.178
When was the last time
you were away from here
for more than a week?

28:01.245 --> 28:04.348
You got me.
I can't remember.
My honeymoon?

28:04.415 --> 28:07.418
You want some words
of wisdom, Donald?
From you, always.

28:07.484 --> 28:11.088
There never is a right time
to travel. You got to make
the time to go and explore,

28:11.155 --> 28:14.458
because when you come back,
nothing will have changed.

28:14.525 --> 28:17.594
The same hospital,
the same patients--
some better, some not.

28:17.661 --> 28:20.597
St. Eligius will
outlive us both.

28:20.664 --> 28:23.801
All right. I'll try
and keep that in mind.

28:23.867 --> 28:26.203
<i>I wish I had realized that
before I got cancer.</i>

28:26.270 --> 28:28.872
But now I'm
into other therapies,
something besides radiation,

28:28.939 --> 28:31.442
<i>something to improve
the quality of my life.</i>

28:31.508 --> 28:33.644

a trip to Mexico.

- No, cabo san Lucas.

28:37.347 --> 28:39.283
The best Marlin fishing
in the world.

28:39.349 --> 28:42.453
Good idea.
I'll see you later, Daniel.

28:45.122 --> 28:47.658
<i>Ah, Dr. Westphall.
Hello, Ben.
Who's your friend?</i>

He's the boss.

28:50.494 --> 28:53.597
I thought you said
springsteen was the boss.

28:53.664 --> 28:56.100
Well, he is.
This is the boss
of the hospital.

28:56.166 --> 28:58.168
Hi, Doc.
Hi, Robby.

28:58.235 --> 29:03.440
What happened?
I was running a hitch pattern
in Double zone coverage,

29:03.507 --> 29:06.076
and I got my cleats
caught on the turf.

29:06.143 --> 29:08.746
[ chuckles ]
got it?

29:08.812 --> 29:11.749
Dr. Westphall
used to play football
in a leather helmet.

29:11.815 --> 29:16.120
And no face Mask. See, in my day
single wing to the right was
a very complicated play.

29:16.186 --> 29:19.189
And no face Mask?
You could bust
your nose doing that.

29:19.256 --> 29:22.526
I did.
Robby's a future
all-Pro wide Receiver.

29:22.593 --> 29:24.528
He wants to know what
I'm going to do to him.

29:24.595 --> 29:28.399
I'm gonna introduce him
to Dr. Dembones.
The best in his field.

29:28.465 --> 29:30.401
See ya later, Pal.
Thank you.

29:34.438 --> 29:36.573
Is that Dr. Dembones?

29:36.640 --> 29:39.676
Ah, not yet.
Where is he?

29:39.743 --> 29:41.779
Right here Behind

29:41.845 --> 29:45.282
Robby Durant,

29:45.349 --> 29:47.317
Shake hands with
the doctor, Robby.

29:47.384 --> 29:50.654
What happened to him?
Hospital Food.

29:50.721 --> 29:54.458
Can I, uh, show you
something in a loafer?

29:54.525 --> 29:57.494
Okay, you see this?
This bone is called
the tibia.

29:57.561 --> 29:59.563
Now, your break
is right here.

29:59.630 --> 30:04.568
Now, after I clean the dirt,
the grass and the rest of
the 30 yard line out of here,

30:04.635 --> 30:06.937
what I'm gonna do is
put in a couple of pins...

30:07.004 --> 30:09.740
that will
connect "a" to "B."

30:09.807 --> 30:11.975
That way it's gonna be
real strong, huh?

30:12.042 --> 30:15.913
It'll heal properly,
and it'll give you
the mobility to do this.

30:17.281 --> 30:19.216
So where's the pin?

30:19.283 --> 30:21.285
Well, would you
hold my friend, please?

30:22.853 --> 30:24.721
Right here.

30:24.788 --> 30:29.493
Oh. When you said pin,
I thought you meant
a needle-and-Thread Pin.

30:29.560 --> 30:32.930
Look, we're talking bones.
You know, you need
something really Strong.

30:32.996 --> 30:35.799
Is this gonna hurt?
Nah. Piece of cake.

30:35.866 --> 30:39.570
We'll prick you with
a needle, you'll be asleep
for about 45 minutes.

30:39.636 --> 30:42.606
What'll it feel like?

30:42.673 --> 30:46.810
Like a trip to disneyland,

Look, even pros get
the pregame jitters, right?

30:54.918 --> 30:56.920
I guess that's what it is.

30:58.021 --> 31:00.257
I'll be able to move
my foot like this?

do that before.

So, Fiscus, how's
the affair to remember?

31:10.200 --> 31:13.470
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Between you and Cathy Martin.

31:13.537 --> 31:17.474
I can't talk about it.
Come on, Fiscus.
You can tell me.

31:17.541 --> 31:20.244
It's too personal.

So, are we talking

and blood test,

You'll be the first
to know, Daniels.

No privacy.

Very nice.
Okay, I give up,

the whole truth?
And nothing but.

I'm in love with her.

You're kidding.
I wish I was.

32:04.788 --> 32:08.025

giving her the necklace
was a wonderful thing to do.
