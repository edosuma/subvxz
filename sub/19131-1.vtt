00:33.736 --> 00:35.899
<i>- Happy Birthday!
- Hey, birthday cake!</i>

00:37.942 --> 00:39.692
<i>- There I am.
- Thank you.</i>

00:41.153 --> 00:42.850
<i>That's nice!</i>

00:44.507 --> 00:48.636
<i>Wait, everybody wants this?</i>

00:52.826 --> 00:55.592
That's what happens when
you do a mercy invite.

00:55.693 --> 00:57.643
I believe you manage
to invite everyone.

00:58.144 --> 01:01.406
Dad, I can't invite everyone in my
art class, except for one person

01:01.441 --> 01:03.103
without social networking evidence,

01:03.133 --> 01:05.603
inflicting more pain on that
person wasn't intended.

01:05.638 --> 01:08.382
- And I'm not a monster.
- I'm proud of you, I think.

01:09.769 --> 01:13.872
She gets detention a lot,
and she yells at teacher sometimes.

01:14.373 --> 01:17.972
And there was a rumor that went around that
she just kept running from home.

01:18.173 --> 01:19.004
Maybe she can UBER.

01:19.034 --> 01:21.134
I seriously believe
that we can go home now.

01:21.135 --> 01:23.927
Did I mistakenly convey
this is a democracy?

01:23.952 --> 01:26.618
We are not going until
she gets picked up.

01:29.204 --> 01:33.283
The car broke down.
I'm just gonna take the bus.

01:33.284 --> 01:35.385
You're not taking a bus,
I'll drive you home.

01:35.386 --> 01:38.342
Claire has almost saved her half
of the money she needs for her car.

01:38.343 --> 01:39.083
Isn't that right?

01:39.113 --> 01:42.333
At least it'll be one of a few times
left that I can drive you guys around.

01:46.193 --> 01:49.449
You won't be able to hear my Dad
tell jokes that only he thinks

01:49.479 --> 01:52.157
are funny for an entire car ride,
unless you come.

01:52.658 --> 01:55.124
You don't really wanna miss that.

02:01.676 --> 02:04.611
Wow,
I got more gifts than I thought you did.

02:05.778 --> 02:06.819
Can I put this in here?

02:06.849 --> 02:08.975
Yeah, yeah, I'll get
it. Thank you, Marcia.

02:09.375 --> 02:11.260
Maybe he's just...

02:11.924 --> 02:14.842
Maybe he's just pretend to worry.

02:24.633 --> 02:26.227
Can I help you?

02:27.805 --> 02:28.093
What?

02:28.123 --> 02:30.835
This is the one he's
so, he's really funny.

02:30.836 --> 02:34.914
- He does this weekly video.
- Wait a minute.

02:34.915 --> 02:38.715
That's so random.
So weird.

02:41.452 --> 02:43.589
You look praise on him.
I don't get it.

02:43.619 --> 02:44.277
Post it!

02:44.278 --> 02:46.537
- Why don't you get it?
- I just don't get it.

02:46.538 --> 02:49.765
- He is cute.
- No, his eyebrows are just like..

02:49.766 --> 02:52.603
Shut up!
His eyebrows, that's the one thing..

02:52.727 --> 02:55.520
Yeah! That gets you!

02:57.045 --> 02:58.408
Okay, that's funny, yeah.

03:04.089 --> 03:07.821
- You see how he does that?
- How does he even do that?

03:07.822 --> 03:09.959
Wa.. wait, why I let you see it.

03:10.081 --> 03:13.805
- Watching, yes!
- This is so bad!

03:25.773 --> 03:26.773
Hey!

03:26.973 --> 03:29.551
Pardon me, Sir.
I think you have the wrong car.

06:11.321 --> 06:13.275
We woke up in here.

06:21.772 --> 06:23.535
What the hell is going on?

06:24.282 --> 06:27.638
What are we doing here?
What happened to my dad?

06:27.839 --> 06:30.216
He's out there.

06:31.959 --> 06:34.438
Do you know what happened to my dad?

07:27.975 --> 07:30.343
I choose you first.

07:36.911 --> 07:38.752
It's only gonna be a minute.

07:44.280 --> 07:46.554
Pee on yourself.
Pee on yourself.

07:46.855 --> 07:48.055
No! No!

07:59.313 --> 08:00.517
No!

08:01.124 --> 08:02.526
Don't!

08:03.983 --> 08:05.369
No!

08:07.202 --> 08:09.191
Open the door!

08:24.155 --> 08:27.069
I'm here, okay?
Are you okay?

08:29.206 --> 08:32.082
He wanted me dance for him.

08:38.384 --> 08:40.573
The outer door is locked.

08:44.329 --> 08:45.771
Everything is okay.

08:47.905 --> 08:49.939
We're okay.

08:51.433 --> 08:53.452
We're okay.

09:00.096 --> 09:02.587
I hear the tiny soul splashed.

09:02.888 --> 09:06.820
And here it comes, a freak of nature,
like this,

09:07.255 --> 09:10.914
so he comes across the stream.
And he's so tall,

09:10.949 --> 09:13.518
that the water doesn't even
get to his belly.

09:14.324 --> 09:18.620
Then he stops.
My heart's coming out of my chest.

09:20.130 --> 09:24.011
You got bug fever.
Uncle John's got bug fever.

09:24.759 --> 09:26.760
That's not true, Casey.
Your dad is a liar.

09:27.061 --> 09:29.544
- How big was the rack?
- It was huge!

09:30.017 --> 09:32.380
- Where is supposed to look on, Casey?
- At the body.

09:32.481 --> 09:35.794
- And why is he looking at the rack?
- 'Cause he got bug fever.

09:36.416 --> 09:38.910
She'll say anything you've said.

09:38.911 --> 09:42.157
Are you gonna do that when you got
your mentored hunting license in 3 years?

09:42.359 --> 09:43.870
No, Sir.

09:43.971 --> 09:46.137
Be sure you put your gloves on
after you finish.

09:46.448 --> 09:49.704
Your feet and your hands get cold first
out there.

10:17.709 --> 10:19.679
Three students abducted.
The father of one of the students

10:19.685 --> 10:22.993
woke up daze from in King of Prussia,

10:23.093 --> 10:25.728
reportedly drugged, he found the kids
and the car missing.

10:25.863 --> 10:27.805
Neighbors are in disbelief.

10:27.806 --> 10:31.311
A normally quiet convenient is real
after the savage.

10:32.979 --> 10:36.350
If you any information concerning
these girls you are heard,

10:36.380 --> 10:37.922
please contact the police.

10:43.667 --> 10:47.206
"Barry S: I need to see you. Urgent."

10:55.215 --> 10:57.733
Doesn't matter if you
open that door, Claire.

10:57.763 --> 10:59.537
There is a second locked door.

11:00.868 --> 11:02.939
He's gonna come in here again.
And his second in,

11:02.969 --> 11:05.040
we're not letting him
take one of us out again.

11:07.525 --> 11:09.454
We just gridded and screamed.

11:09.484 --> 11:13.480
We didn't hurt him because we
were afraid to get him upset.

11:13.981 --> 11:16.591
God, that's victim's shit! Jesus!

11:16.892 --> 11:20.882
We should fight him.
We should drop a crazy ass balm on him.

11:22.001 --> 11:25.711
I saw him carried one of you and laid
you in the bed like you had nothing.

11:27.067 --> 11:29.403
Punching him would not gonna help us out.

11:30.108 --> 11:33.447
I took, I took six months
of kempo karate class.

11:33.477 --> 11:35.750
And you distract him with pain.

11:35.751 --> 11:39.477
Everything is so easy for you guys.

11:39.878 --> 11:42.813
You do one thing, he can predict
the next thing.

11:44.410 --> 11:47.191
It's not the way it's gonna be
in this situation.

11:47.192 --> 11:49.392
We're not getting out
of here! You're saying,

11:49.422 --> 11:51.772
you're not gonna fight
with everything in you?

11:53.483 --> 11:56.602
You know, the only chance..

11:56.702 --> 12:00.145
The only chance we have..
is if all three of us go crazy on this guy.

12:02.002 --> 12:03.976
We have to hurry.

12:07.276 --> 12:09.729
We need you, Casey.

12:10.211 --> 12:13.082
Claire is smart, let's listen to her.

12:14.273 --> 12:16.996
I'll do it if you're gonna do it, too.

12:19.554 --> 12:22.666
- We can win.
- He'll hurt us.

12:23.313 --> 12:28.031
Now, shut up, both of you.

12:28.952 --> 12:32.303
You're gonna pick your miserable self up
and help us get out of here.

12:34.423 --> 12:36.465
Blow me.

12:36.976 --> 12:40.579
And your 6 months of karate at the
King of Prussia Mall can blow me, too.

12:40.614 --> 12:44.281
No, no, you can't do this today!
You can't do this right now!

12:44.700 --> 12:46.546
Why are you do this! Why are you
act like this?

12:46.547 --> 12:49.028
Why do act like you're not one of us?

12:54.653 --> 12:57.845
I'll let you know when I hear something
that makes sense.

13:01.067 --> 13:03.766
We don't even know what this is yet.

13:10.094 --> 13:12.600
I was inspired.

13:16.769 --> 13:20.831
No, no, that one, before the pink fraco,

13:20.866 --> 13:23.404
That supposed to be like a..
Like a tailored jacket..

13:23.439 --> 13:26.763
But I'm gonna himp her with
newspaper headlines.

13:28.533 --> 13:32.049
Well, I'm a simple blouse and
skirt person, but these..

13:34.367 --> 13:37.109
These are very artistic, Barry.

13:37.354 --> 13:40.683
Just the kinda thing Hamptons' ladies
would spend 15000 dollars on

13:40.724 --> 13:44.292
to wear once at a charity ball.

13:44.327 --> 13:49.278
Shut up! You know, I can't stay too long.
This is just a visit.

13:50.482 --> 13:52.778
Well, tell me what's going on?

13:54.236 --> 13:57.164
What? You mean the email?
It's just the usual thing.

13:57.189 --> 13:58.742
Just feeling a bit overwhelmed.

13:58.843 --> 14:02.731
Your email made it sounds specific
and time related.

14:03.332 --> 14:07.613
- Are, are you looking for something?
- No. I'm just admiring.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.727
- I'm better now.
- How's work?

14:09.828 --> 14:12.691
- Great!
- When I last spoke to them,

14:13.031 --> 14:15.884
they believe you were a model employee.

14:15.885 --> 14:18.992
They found you meticulous
and conscientious.

14:18.993 --> 14:21.588
- You know this, right?
- I do.

14:21.589 --> 14:25.562
You've managed there for 10 years.
It's functioning very well, Barry.

14:26.819 --> 14:29.696
And it's a rare and wonderful place
for you to work.

14:29.797 --> 14:32.756
- Yes it is.
- You know, of all my other clients

14:32.791 --> 14:36.947
with your disorder, you've been
the most consistent at your job.

14:39.149 --> 14:41.049
Did something happen, Barry?

14:42.016 --> 14:44.003
How old are you?

14:44.703 --> 14:47.351
The internet isn't
consistent on this point.

14:47.452 --> 14:49.475
Why is that on your mind?

14:49.658 --> 14:53.462
Who's gonna look after you when
you retired or passed on?

14:53.463 --> 14:55.998
You know, we're gonna have
to take care of ourselves

14:56.028 --> 14:58.017
and nobody even
believes that we exist.

14:58.218 --> 15:00.375
If ever something would happened to me,

15:00.687 --> 15:03.839
I've made arrangements with a colleague
from Baltimore to take over.

15:04.039 --> 15:05.039
Hmm..

15:06.276 --> 15:09.641
Hey, you a..
you live alone?

15:09.642 --> 15:12.503
- You know this.
- I'm sorry, I just meant how long?

15:12.804 --> 15:15.269
Always.

15:16.558 --> 15:19.087
That must be so lonely.

15:25.634 --> 15:29.577
You know what, I'm..
I'm doing much better.

15:29.677 --> 15:30.877
I shouldn't have emailed you.

15:30.878 --> 15:33.505
I'm just.. Look at me,
I'm too impulsive.

15:37.034 --> 15:41.819
By the way, is anybody listening?
Does anybody care about us?

15:42.535 --> 15:46.348
Yes, the University of Paris asked me
to do a lecture, in fact.

15:46.684 --> 15:49.755
I'm going to be doing it via Skype,
from right here.

15:49.855 --> 15:53.455
People are believing more.

15:54.603 --> 15:58.204
- Let's meet at our usual time next week.
- I'd rather you didn't leave, Barry.

16:00.270 --> 16:02.508
Did something happen?

16:02.509 --> 16:06.219
Don't worry, this was just a visit.
I'm doing much better.

16:06.220 --> 16:07.909
And what's with your sketches, Barry?

16:08.009 --> 16:12.509
You're usually very protective of them.

16:13.341 --> 16:15.563
Yeah, thanks.

16:18.824 --> 16:21.698
I'll see you next week
at our usual time.

16:22.257 --> 16:26.110
Thanks for fighting for us, Dr. Fletcher.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.969
- Thanks, Dr. Fletcher.
- You're welcome.

16:40.370 --> 16:43.031
- I just think I'm gonna blow it.
- No, it would be great.

16:43.032 --> 16:45.301
- I'll see you next week.
- Okay, thank you.

16:56.949 --> 16:59.536
I don't know how you work with
those people.

17:00.037 --> 17:02.717
- With what people?
- Your patients.

17:03.018 --> 17:07.858
You can't use your thumbs
to spin the wheel, dumb asses!

17:08.367 --> 17:10.645
They always use their thumbs!

17:12.530 --> 17:18.436
Well, we look at people who've been
shattered and different as less than,

17:19.268 --> 17:23.051
What if, they are more than us?

17:23.794 --> 17:25.335
What?

17:28.544 --> 17:31.115
You believe them? Your patients?

17:31.215 --> 17:33.315
You know, just between you and me.

17:33.316 --> 17:35.264
Yes, I do.

17:35.833 --> 17:37.803
Flick it! Flick it!

17:41.458 --> 17:44.010
I don't believe it.
No offense.

17:51.274 --> 17:53.464
That! I need to buy that.

17:57.531 --> 18:00.308
- He's back.
- There is a lady outside.

18:09.395 --> 18:13.744
- Dennis, admit what you've done.
- Don't get upset.

18:15.210 --> 18:18.662
Take down, I'm getting frightened.

18:21.295 --> 18:23.761
I thought that you had this under control.

18:23.862 --> 18:27.316
- Please tell me it's not too late.
- The food in the waiting.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.188
Is she in that room?

18:35.566 --> 18:37.094
- We are here!
- Help us!

18:37.124 --> 18:38.079
We are here!

18:38.280 --> 18:41.747
- Jesus, how many are they?
- No, no, don't go in there!

18:52.050 --> 18:53.755
Don't worry.

18:56.062 --> 19:00.856
I'll talk to him.
He listens to me.

19:08.765 --> 19:11.312
He's not well.
He knows what you're here for.

19:11.813 --> 19:16.323
He's not allowed to touch you.

19:16.724 --> 19:19.289
He knows that.

19:49.572 --> 19:51.044
- Karen.
- Joe.

19:51.245 --> 19:54.625
They said you can have your own part
at the national conference.

19:56.516 --> 20:00.674
They conceded, however, I can be part of
the mood disorder pattern.

20:00.675 --> 20:04.503
- It's not a mood disorder.
- I'm aware your beliefs, Karen.

20:04.630 --> 20:08.596
Well, were they open this time with
a new evidence?

20:08.597 --> 20:11.041
One of your arguments is a dog.

20:11.374 --> 20:13.190
You submitted video of a dog

20:13.276 --> 20:16.276
acting differently to one of your patients
at different time.

20:16.277 --> 20:18.091
It is more dramatic than that.

20:18.291 --> 20:20.891
They are what they believe they are.

20:21.092 --> 20:24.078
The brain has learned to defend itself.

20:24.079 --> 20:26.722
You treated them like they're
supernaturally gifted.

20:26.752 --> 20:28.618
Like they have powers or something.

20:28.619 --> 20:31.997
Karen, these are patients.
They have been to trauma.

20:35.279 --> 20:39.792
And perhaps now they're capable of
something we're not.

20:41.431 --> 20:43.885
We have brain scans now.

20:44.220 --> 20:49.755
DID patients have changed their
body chemistry with their thoughts.

20:52.298 --> 20:53.770
He was just trying to scare us.

20:54.770 --> 20:58.970
He was making a fool conversation
with himself.

20:59.317 --> 21:02.191
What was that line about
the food is waiting?

21:02.792 --> 21:06.175
Does everyone get out whacked? Just listen,
we need to get out of here now.

21:15.527 --> 21:18.418
Yeah, no, please.

21:18.819 --> 21:21.927
Keep your area neat.
The bathroom is unacceptable.

21:22.028 --> 21:23.128
I'll make it easy.

21:23.228 --> 21:27.728
I, I've called a code of this.
Use the blue bottle for the floor.

21:27.767 --> 21:30.531
And the pink bottle for ceramic surfaces.

21:54.122 --> 21:56.909
Patricia has reminded me that..

21:57.009 --> 21:59.709
I was sent to get you
for a reason.

21:59.710 --> 22:03.230
That you are sacred food.

22:04.128 --> 22:06.567
And I promise not to bother you again.

22:19.642 --> 22:22.558
Maybe he has a dog or something.

22:22.593 --> 22:25.637
I think he's gonna feed us
to his dogs.

22:58.890 --> 23:00.184
Casey.

23:01.904 --> 23:03.438
Casey!

23:21.589 --> 23:24.809
My name is Hedwig.
I have red socks.

23:31.389 --> 23:34.576
He's on the move.

23:36.396 --> 23:38.394
What?

23:41.260 --> 23:46.939
He's on the move.

23:49.396 --> 23:52.907
- Who?
- Someone who's coming for you.

23:53.608 --> 23:56.575
And you're not gonna like it.

23:56.775 --> 23:59.775
You guys make noises in your sleep.

23:59.813 --> 24:02.171
- Tell us.
- I'm not supposed to say.

24:03.759 --> 24:06.492
Hmm.. But, he's done
awful things to people.

24:06.517 --> 24:08.557
And he'll do awful
things to you.

24:08.558 --> 24:11.147
- I have blue socks, too.
- His food?

24:16.079 --> 24:19.978
- How old are you?
- Nine.

24:22.231 --> 24:25.952
So you're not the guy that took us?

24:26.864 --> 24:31.739
- No.
- You're not the lady?

24:32.040 --> 24:33.930
What are you blind?

24:34.512 --> 24:39.233
- You don't know how they think?
- No, they don't, they don't tell me much.

24:39.334 --> 24:41.735
I just ate a hotdog.

24:42.675 --> 24:45.981
Could you help us, Hedwig?

24:47.105 --> 24:49.976
No. I'm,
I'm not even supposed to be here.

24:50.370 --> 24:53.203
I stole a light from Mr. Dennis,
but he'll be back real soon.

24:53.338 --> 24:58.755
I can't steal a light for too long or
he'll know and get angry, etc.

25:01.665 --> 25:03.784
- See you!
- Wait!

25:07.694 --> 25:09.637
We heard something.

25:12.161 --> 25:16.805
We didn't understand it, but now we do.

25:19.890 --> 25:23.647
- Do you know what we heard?
- What did you hear?

25:25.260 --> 25:27.058
Come here.

25:29.112 --> 25:31.134
I'll whisper it to you.

25:33.167 --> 25:34.540
Okay.

25:46.578 --> 25:48.465
This guy..

25:51.485 --> 25:53.785
is coming for you.

25:58.510 --> 26:01.883
- You're a big liar.
- I never lie, Hedwig.

26:02.084 --> 26:04.265
But, but Mr. Dennis..

26:05.382 --> 26:08.273
He said that he followed those two girls
for four days.

26:08.792 --> 26:13.726
And that he knew, that they were the ones
that he would want.

26:15.652 --> 26:20.294
When you're not around, Dennis and the lady
talked about it.

26:20.558 --> 26:23.526
They talked about how he wants a boy
this time.

26:23.627 --> 26:25.443
They're going to give him you.

26:25.444 --> 26:30.067
No, Mrs. Patricia, she said.. She said,
she's not mad at me anymore.

26:30.068 --> 26:32.559
She sings to me sometimes.

26:32.660 --> 26:35.573
I think Mrs. Patricia
still a little mad at you.

26:36.281 --> 26:40.423
Mrs. Patricia thinks I'm..
She thinks I'm stupid.

26:41.680 --> 26:44.275
She thinks I made silly mistakes.

26:44.890 --> 26:48.791
Look at me, we're like your babysitters.

26:50.789 --> 26:53.909
I'll let you watch TV and make you
a fun diner.

26:56.135 --> 26:58.499
We all need to get out of here.

26:58.789 --> 27:03.063
You could show us the way out.
We can be out before anybody gets back.

27:03.064 --> 27:08.294
But we have to hurry, Hedwig.
We have to hurry and get out of here.

27:11.593 --> 27:13.333
Wait, wait a minute.

27:14.512 --> 27:17.650
It took forever to get this place
safe without anybody to work here.

27:17.732 --> 27:20.435
You can't get out of here!

27:20.636 --> 27:22.860
- I have to blow my nose.
- No, no, please do not go!

27:25.516 --> 27:27.378
Who's coming?

27:28.449 --> 27:31.356
- This is seriously scary.
- No one is coming.

27:35.468 --> 27:37.015
He said something.

27:39.742 --> 27:42.782
He said something about
making the room safe.

27:44.355 --> 27:47.005
This is all new drywall.

27:47.287 --> 27:49.310
It wasn't safe.

28:24.030 --> 28:27.139
Wait a minute, we know
he'll notice about this?

28:49.148 --> 28:53.744
Casey, you're right.
There's something in here.

28:54.202 --> 28:58.044
He must covering up the way out.
Tell me if you see him.

29:02.010 --> 29:04.215
Casey, tell us what you see!

29:11.057 --> 29:12.611
He's here.

29:12.812 --> 29:15.721
You can't let him in, you can't let
him in! This is our one chance.

29:18.645 --> 29:20.777
- We're not gonna make it.
- Yes, we are!

29:31.492 --> 29:33.498
Wha.. Hey,
what are you guys doing?

29:39.688 --> 29:42.925
Okay, quit it. Hey guys!

29:43.226 --> 29:46.934
- Let me in.
- Give us a second, we are changing.

29:47.929 --> 29:49.538
What are you guys doing?

29:51.084 --> 29:52.349
Let me in!

29:54.750 --> 29:56.722
Guys, you're not being funny.

30:07.274 --> 30:11.206
You're being a bitch now.
I'm gonna...

30:11.217 --> 30:13.490
Just keep him there as long as you can.

30:14.336 --> 30:17.082
You're gonna get me in trouble.

30:20.264 --> 30:21.504
Guys!

30:23.057 --> 30:24.513
Watch out.

32:11.549 --> 32:13.774
I thought I lost you.

32:17.127 --> 32:20.950
Would you step outside, please?

32:28.734 --> 32:33.625
You like to make fun of us.
But, we're more powerful than you think.

32:33.726 --> 32:35.232
Step outside.

32:37.670 --> 32:38.985
Please.

32:47.676 --> 32:50.042
You shouldn't trick children.

32:50.784 --> 32:53.225
That shows who you are.

32:58.505 --> 33:01.918
Look at your sweater.
It's ruined, it's dirty.

33:04.667 --> 33:06.247
Remove it.

33:37.217 --> 33:40.248
I'm trying to be good.

33:55.807 --> 33:58.615
You'll not see your friend again.

33:59.653 --> 34:01.815
She'll be kept separate.

34:04.656 --> 34:07.360
Now, take off your skirt and
take off your shirt.

34:07.561 --> 34:10.031
Because you got all dirty from the dust.

34:33.210 --> 34:39.062
One identity in an individual with
Dissociative Identity Disorder

34:39.163 --> 34:41.252
Can have high cholesterol.
One.

34:41.876 --> 34:45.833
There are been cases where one identity is
allergic to bee stings.

34:45.962 --> 34:47.579
The others are not.

34:47.580 --> 34:52.009
Are there moments where two identities
can co-exist at the same time?

34:52.010 --> 34:54.661
There are times when two identities

34:54.661 --> 35:00.564
can take the light or the spot, or
consciousness at the same time.

35:00.828 --> 35:03.743
This happened with a student that
I was working with.

35:04.210 --> 35:08.017
And her left and right hands were
taking notes

35:08.316 --> 35:12.618
in different hand-writings about
separate things at the same time.

35:12.819 --> 35:16.818
The differences in the identities
can be dramatic.

35:17.219 --> 35:20.590
As much as the difference
between you and me,

35:20.620 --> 35:23.454
and every person in that auditorium.

35:24.571 --> 35:26.771
The identities have different IQs.

35:26.796 --> 35:28.751
They have different
physical strengths.

35:28.752 --> 35:32.356
One personality is a Russian weightlifter,

35:32.445 --> 35:35.494
and can lift three times of his
body weight.

35:36.264 --> 35:39.201
Their ability to
hyper-focus and have

35:39.231 --> 35:42.168
different experiences
is astounding.

35:45.088 --> 35:48.764
Have these individuals through
their suffering

35:49.283 --> 35:52.608
unlocked the potential of the brain?

35:54.443 --> 35:57.415
Is this the ultimate doorway

35:58.707 --> 36:02.437
to all things we called unknown?

36:04.372 --> 36:09.579
Is this where our sense of the supernatural
comes from?

36:22.774 --> 36:25.259
It's about depth and a..

36:26.553 --> 36:29.372
and curves.
And, hey, you see that one?

36:29.407 --> 36:32.149
It's kinda like a senile sweaty dress.

36:36.215 --> 36:38.072
Who are you?

36:42.624 --> 36:44.171
Barry.

36:45.583 --> 36:47.783
I don't think you are.

36:49.093 --> 36:53.766
I've developed a nose for sensing
whom I'm talking to and whom I'm not.

36:54.900 --> 36:56.826
Have I done something?

36:56.827 --> 37:01.017
You've emailed for an unscheduled
appointment two days in a row.

37:01.418 --> 37:06.138
I just feel overwhelmed,
I've gotten some issues.

37:06.839 --> 37:11.248
I think Orwell, or Jade,
or Samuel..

37:11.283 --> 37:14.631
Or Heinrich had the light for a moment
and emailed me.

37:15.032 --> 37:17.932
And you're here to tell me
everything is okay.

37:17.933 --> 37:20.161
I emailed you.

37:21.670 --> 37:24.447
May I talk to one of them, please?

37:28.442 --> 37:30.260
That can't happen.

37:31.646 --> 37:35.234
I told them that I wanna spend the session
with you today.

37:36.956 --> 37:42.196
I'm gonna ask again.
To whom am I speaking with now?

37:43.484 --> 37:46.441
Dr. Fletcher, it's Barry.

37:47.421 --> 37:52.520
It doesn't seem like Barry.
Barry is an extroverted leader.

37:52.543 --> 37:54.511
Of course, I am.

37:55.735 --> 37:58.450
I'm gonna take a professional guess.

37:58.451 --> 38:04.285
Based on the description of all 23
identities that live in Kevin's body,

38:04.582 --> 38:07.419
that I've gotten from Barry.

38:09.133 --> 38:12.828
I think, I'm talking to Dennis.

38:16.059 --> 38:20.278
But he's been banned from the light
because among other reasons.

38:20.313 --> 38:24.189
He has a proclivity to watch
young girls dance naked,

38:24.190 --> 38:26.705
which he himself knows it's wrong.

38:26.706 --> 38:29.848
And he's fought against it
with a little success.

38:29.883 --> 38:32.621
I'm encouraged we can finally meet.

38:32.622 --> 38:35.841
And I guess this because you've adjusted
the chocolate dish twice.

38:35.960 --> 38:40.052
since you came in here and
I understand you have OCD.

38:41.186 --> 38:43.061
Now I see, now I see.
That's clever.

38:43.562 --> 38:46.839
- But I'm not Dennis.
- And you and Patricia..

38:46.948 --> 38:50.535
have been banned from the light
for quite a while now.

38:50.735 --> 38:53.435
Primarily, shall we say because
of your beliefs.

38:53.436 --> 38:56.467
Patricia and Dennis are very unstable.
I'm not Dennis.

38:56.668 --> 38:58.935
Have you both take in charge now?

38:59.270 --> 39:01.727
Please believe me, I'm Barry.

39:08.891 --> 39:12.366
You must forgive me,
my job is to challenge you.

39:13.583 --> 39:15.646
And as you must know by now,

39:15.797 --> 39:19.950
I have plenty of opinions about
how everyone should live their lives.

39:22.163 --> 39:25.629
Ask me something about fashion,
I'll prove it.

39:25.659 --> 39:26.737
Or.. Or you..

39:30.335 --> 39:31.498
Look, look, look.

39:33.336 --> 39:37.795
You see, I'm not Dennis.
You want me to do something else?

39:38.619 --> 39:41.748
You got ice cream? This shirt is
cotton blend anyway.

39:42.049 --> 39:46.305
The color is from three seasons ago.
It's nude, I mean, come on.

40:05.350 --> 40:08.454
Jay, what health conscious fast food
prepare

40:08.554 --> 40:10.638
Did you originally buy
these chicken wings,

40:10.668 --> 40:13.334
you're so lovingly heated it
in minor suicidal gesture?

40:13.335 --> 40:15.809
Hooters. You can't just threw
them out, Dr. Fletcher.

40:15.810 --> 40:19.152
This is so wrong on so many levels.
We finished about 3:15,

40:19.153 --> 40:20.555
so look around 3:18.

40:22.280 --> 40:24.224
You're getting a little
softer on the middle, Jay.

40:25.822 --> 40:28.697
The authors of hooters
play on that need for fat,

40:28.934 --> 40:32.706
and men to be in the proximity
of augmented breasts.

40:32.707 --> 40:36.419
It's like Henry the 5th running
a fast food franchise.

40:36.420 --> 40:39.647
- It's a good place, Dr. Fletcher.
- Hmm.. right.

40:40.428 --> 40:42.601
How did you know the
trash will be spilled?

40:42.602 --> 40:46.286
How can I say this, Jay, you're not
the most meticulous of people.

41:03.287 --> 41:05.863
This guys isn't very neat as he walked
right through the trash.

41:05.864 --> 41:09.513
No, Jay. A normal person
would've walked around that.

41:09.614 --> 41:14.990
That was an act.
What are your object, Dennis?

41:16.435 --> 41:19.257
Or is it Patricia who deciding things?

41:22.489 --> 41:24.585
We're not gonna die.

41:25.312 --> 41:27.299
Bad things happened.

41:28.378 --> 41:30.323
But not like this.

41:31.206 --> 41:33.027
Casey.

41:33.428 --> 41:35.375
Talk to me.

41:37.639 --> 41:42.111
We need to get through a window
or a door?

41:57.127 --> 41:59.318
The trail.

41:59.434 --> 42:03.705
Casey, it's about where you can or can't.
You have to outsmart this animal.

42:06.820 --> 42:09.493
So you didn't used to like
to come out here.

42:09.567 --> 42:12.200
This is like our family tradition, right?

42:13.437 --> 42:16.371
- Good shooting, Bro.
- Thank you, John.

42:24.426 --> 42:27.001
I have your meal, sleepyhead.

42:31.887 --> 42:33.602
Eat.

42:40.119 --> 42:44.025
It's good?
It's got paprika in it.

42:48.079 --> 42:50.011
I'm sorry.

42:51.581 --> 42:55.526
I think I'll put a pretty flower
in your hair.

42:58.496 --> 43:00.031
Oh, yeah.

43:06.872 --> 43:09.847
This is to show how important you are.

43:10.360 --> 43:13.258
Come along.
And we'll have a proper meal.

43:17.078 --> 43:20.975
I understand, these must all seem
so unsatisfactory for you.

43:21.094 --> 43:24.131
But, we are doing the best we can.

43:43.007 --> 43:44.707
Good?

43:51.435 --> 43:56.533
- Can Claire come eat with us?
- No, I'm afraid that can't happen.

43:57.272 --> 44:01.310
She almost ruined our big reception.

44:07.288 --> 44:11.270
I've heard that Asian people's music
helps digestion.

44:12.908 --> 44:15.328
I'll make you a second sandwich.

44:19.244 --> 44:20.596
Do you know..

44:22.044 --> 44:26.887
How many of lions can
eat 35 pounds a day?

44:29.014 --> 44:32.491
A bug can loose 30% of its
weight during mating season

44:32.517 --> 44:35.004
chasing those round?

44:35.005 --> 44:37.887
That creep paskula, right?

44:38.001 --> 44:41.759
Means they travel around during
dask and dawn. Good for you.

44:58.748 --> 45:00.498
It's crooked.

45:01.297 --> 45:02.972
Forgive me.

45:12.489 --> 45:14.217
I don't know if you know, but..

45:14.338 --> 45:17.603
Tigers have only 30 teeth.

45:19.057 --> 45:22.210
That's 12 less than a dog.

45:22.539 --> 45:25.240
I thought that was a fun fact.

45:58.354 --> 46:01.144
Go to your room, shut the door.
Do it now.

46:36.293 --> 46:41.101
"In the sun, we'll find our passion"

46:42.178 --> 46:46.860
"In the sun, we will find our purpose"

46:52.858 --> 46:56.823
You've always been protected,
you've never truly suffered.

46:57.575 --> 47:02.322
That's why we chose you.
You've always been asleep.

47:06.227 --> 47:08.062
You've had a chance.

47:12.972 --> 47:15.081
You've never had a chance.

47:16.512 --> 47:19.552
The dark-haired girl,
she's gonna be kept in another closet.

47:19.582 --> 47:21.540
I might as well know what this point.

47:22.008 --> 47:27.836
The beast is coming for you.
All three of you.

47:27.837 --> 47:29.394
You'll gonna be kept separate.

47:31.070 --> 47:34.903
You've got a crumb on your shirt.

47:37.385 --> 47:39.118
Please take it off.

47:42.224 --> 47:44.031
Just.. just take it off.

48:34.770 --> 48:37.608
It wasn't nice what you
said about Mrs. Patricia.

48:38.394 --> 48:40.036
You lied.

48:44.412 --> 48:46.538
I'm sorry about that, Hedwig.

48:47.671 --> 48:52.003
You guys lied to me,
made me scare, etc.

48:55.150 --> 48:59.736
Mr. Dennis says you wear a lot of shirts.
I like this shirt.

49:00.770 --> 49:02.021
Thank you.

49:02.322 --> 49:04.485
Do you know who Dennis
and Mrs. Patricia are?

49:04.770 --> 49:06.276
No.

49:08.194 --> 49:11.805
See, everyone of us has to wait
in a chair.

49:12.936 --> 49:17.027
And Barry, he decides to stand
in the light.

49:17.028 --> 49:19.648
But Barry lost that power
because of me.

49:21.762 --> 49:27.718
I can wish myself in the light
anytime I want with a special power.

49:29.377 --> 49:32.112
And Barry just have to
keep sitting in his chair,

49:32.142 --> 49:33.053
if I wanted to.

49:34.369 --> 49:37.707
That's why Dennis and Mrs.
Patricia said I could be with them.

49:38.911 --> 49:40.961
Dennis and Mrs. Patricia,
they believe

49:40.992 --> 49:44.329
in the beast and what it can do.

49:45.396 --> 49:48.341
Have you seen him?

49:49.499 --> 49:52.335
The.. beast?

49:54.168 --> 49:56.549
No. Can I kiss you?

49:57.205 --> 49:59.794
I wanted to kiss the other
girl with the dark-hair,

49:59.824 --> 50:00.963
but she's in trouble.

50:05.034 --> 50:05.814
So you want to?

50:05.844 --> 50:07.925
I don't know much
about kissing, though.

50:07.926 --> 50:09.844
Yeah.

50:12.757 --> 50:14.028
Okay.

50:16.681 --> 50:19.052
Okay, here we..

50:20.798 --> 50:24.402
One, two, three.

50:27.002 --> 50:33.432
P s a g m e n o . com

50:40.161 --> 50:42.195
You might be pregnant now.

50:44.436 --> 50:47.837
- Am I a good kisser?
- Yeah.

50:48.587 --> 50:51.142
I love dancing.
You like dancing?

50:52.248 --> 50:55.411
I like dancing to my CD player
in my room.

50:55.612 --> 50:57.605
Kanye West is my main man.

50:58.804 --> 51:03.556
We got my CD player set up in my room,
right next to my window.

51:04.247 --> 51:05.653
I'm like.. Ugh..

51:12.160 --> 51:13.623
"Guess the moves!"

51:13.624 --> 51:15.318
Wow!

51:16.655 --> 51:22.612
Maybe I could watch you dance
and listen to music with you.

51:24.107 --> 51:28.388
- No, my music is in my room.
- Wow, right.

51:30.597 --> 51:34.477
Maybe you could sneak me there.

51:35.895 --> 51:39.759
Are you trying to trick me, etc?

51:40.873 --> 51:42.496
I'll tell on you.

51:43.046 --> 51:45.656
- I'm telling on you!
- I'll tell you something.

51:46.539 --> 51:48.777
And you can tell me if I'm lying
or not, okay?

51:48.877 --> 51:51.677
- Like a test, okay?
- Uh huh.

51:56.093 --> 52:00.640
I get into trouble at school
on purpose.

52:05.185 --> 52:07.645
So I can get sent to detention.

52:12.201 --> 52:15.790
To get away from everyone.

52:22.422 --> 52:24.644
So that I can be alone.

52:36.169 --> 52:39.245
Okay, I'll show you something cool
in my room.

52:39.816 --> 52:40.950
Okay.

52:41.627 --> 52:44.792
But after Mr. Dennis has finished
to getting ready with the ritual.

52:45.593 --> 52:48.020
I have to go. He's got
an appointment.

52:48.208 --> 52:49.271
When I fall sleeping,

52:49.301 --> 52:52.843
one of the others keep trying to reach
what the doctor lady tell on us.

52:53.450 --> 52:57.928
That pant, it's got a red lining.
You can see it down the side.

52:59.263 --> 53:02.800
We've been talking about silk and wool
blonde for 20 minutes.

53:03.841 --> 53:06.635
Can I guess that you emailed me
in the middle of the night,

53:06.835 --> 53:09.535
for an emergency session.

53:09.595 --> 53:12.431
Due to variety issues...

53:14.494 --> 53:19.485
Aha! I was down and I emailed you.
And I woke up and I feel better.

53:19.486 --> 53:21.708
I.. I feel better.

53:22.639 --> 53:24.974
I had a thought.

53:25.974 --> 53:29.019
I want to talk about the incident at work.

53:29.020 --> 53:31.588
It's okay, Barry.
You're safe.

53:32.189 --> 53:37.098
I just wanna bring the details back.
We're just talk about the details.

53:39.329 --> 53:44.852
A high school from Camden New Jersey
was on a field trip at your place of work.

53:45.316 --> 53:48.533
And two young ladies came up to you.

53:48.830 --> 53:52.641
And one took your hand and put
it under her shirt on her breast.

53:52.676 --> 53:54.074
And the second did the same.

53:54.104 --> 53:56.751
And then they just run off,
laughing to their friends.

53:56.752 --> 53:59.782
You thought that they might be on a dare.

53:59.862 --> 54:02.171
You said they were 17 or 18.

54:02.272 --> 54:04.505
You said it upset you for days.

54:04.506 --> 54:06.954
It was just a teenage prank.
I get that now.

54:08.289 --> 54:11.017
And see, that's my mistake.

54:11.345 --> 54:15.516
I believe that I went over this incident
with you too fast.

54:15.717 --> 54:18.415
Although you said, you were fine.

54:18.995 --> 54:22.594
And the other identities I met with said,
it was fine.

54:22.992 --> 54:25.633
I believe that this..

54:25.938 --> 54:29.937
brought up issues from when
you were a child and abused.

54:30.137 --> 54:32.956
Sometimes another incident of abuse

54:33.143 --> 54:36.150
can cause suppressed personalities
to take the light.

54:36.852 --> 54:38.948
Dennis, if this is you..

54:39.649 --> 54:43.028
I completely understand..

54:43.029 --> 54:46.443
Why you felt the need to take over
and protect the others.

54:47.337 --> 54:49.124
Doctor, not this again.

54:49.225 --> 54:52.944
The others told me that you and Patricia
told the group about this beast.

54:52.979 --> 54:55.907
And I told them that

54:55.942 --> 55:00.415
these are just scary stories that
Dennis and Patricia

55:00.450 --> 55:02.663
tell the others, to scare them.

55:02.664 --> 55:05.225
How this beast can crawl on walls,

55:05.260 --> 55:09.761
like the best rock climbers using
this lightest friction and in perfections.

55:09.796 --> 55:14.232
to hold his body close to seemingly
sheer surfaces.

55:14.633 --> 55:19.275
How his skin is thick and tough,
like rhinoceros.

55:21.673 --> 55:25.883
Do you really believe the stories
about the beast?

55:28.667 --> 55:30.714
If this is you, Dennis,

55:31.868 --> 55:35.399
I understand why Kevin needs you.

55:36.368 --> 55:40.727
You are strong and disciplined.
You are precise.

55:40.728 --> 55:43.722
And you will not be taken
advantage of.

55:45.007 --> 55:47.892
You can trust me.

55:48.393 --> 55:53.614
For example, I do have the ability to use
Kevin's full name

55:53.714 --> 55:56.657
and bring him forth, as he has
in the past.

55:56.957 --> 55:59.157
But I wouldn't do that.

55:59.398 --> 56:03.643
I know that, that would be chaos
for all of you.

56:03.844 --> 56:05.737
Everyone would grab the light.

56:05.762 --> 56:08.347
I don't wanna hurt
any of you that way.

56:09.957 --> 56:12.583
You don't have to hide.

56:13.022 --> 56:16.200
I know you are someone who
cares for Kevin.

56:18.544 --> 56:21.997
You are not evil to me.

56:24.226 --> 56:27.397
You were necessary.

56:29.069 --> 56:33.370
Dennis, is that you?

56:48.179 --> 56:50.925
They keep calling us the horde.

56:52.769 --> 56:54.996
The others, you know.

56:55.776 --> 56:59.804
Mrs. Patricia and I,
we're ridiculed.

57:00.724 --> 57:02.381
No, we're not perfect.

57:02.406 --> 57:05.417
But, we don't deserve
to be ridiculed.

57:06.823 --> 57:10.398
We're all struggling.
They have to admit that.

57:15.632 --> 57:18.203
I am pleased to meet you, Dennis.

57:19.958 --> 57:21.549
You, too.

57:24.313 --> 57:28.156
I seemed you don't know who emailed me
for the emergency session.

57:28.982 --> 57:30.868
One of the others.

57:32.261 --> 57:34.998
- Are you in charge?
- Yeah, we've taken charge.

57:35.299 --> 57:37.548
We're the only one who can
protect Kevin.

57:37.828 --> 57:40.643
We're all here to protect Kevin.

57:40.781 --> 57:42.793
He's very weak.

57:44.993 --> 57:47.693
He doesn't know how powerful
we can be.

57:48.367 --> 57:51.535
Would you mind telling me,
when you first came into existence?

57:54.865 --> 57:59.904
And how you and Patricia, the other
undesirable identity, became aligned?

58:03.588 --> 58:07.513
That's okay.
Do you still have strong beliefs?

58:08.276 --> 58:12.843
- That depends on what.
- The story of the beast.

58:18.942 --> 58:22.779
One thing, Dennis, that may comfort you
if you are confused,

58:22.814 --> 58:26.186
is that you've met the other alters.

58:26.559 --> 58:30.055
You're all in a room in chairs, right?

58:30.056 --> 58:31.927
Yeah.

58:31.928 --> 58:36.371
But you never met the beast? Because he
doesn't reside with the rest of you?

58:36.372 --> 58:39.697
Because he resides in the train yard,
as the story goes.

58:39.698 --> 58:42.256
Because Kevin's dad left on the train.

58:42.257 --> 58:47.012
But the fact is, you and Patricia
have never met the beast.

58:47.513 --> 58:50.719
- Have you?
- No.

58:52.047 --> 58:57.847
That's because he's not an alter.
He's not the 24th identity.

58:59.329 --> 59:01.729
He is a fantasy.

59:20.616 --> 59:22.410
Hurry up! Let's go!

59:22.911 --> 59:24.866
Come on, it's time!

01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:54.161
- Wow.
- I know.

01:00:55.851 --> 01:00:58.978
- This is your CD player?
- Yeah.

01:01:02.064 --> 01:01:06.059
You don't like it? It's not new.

01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:08.544
No, no, I'm just a..

01:01:11.169 --> 01:01:14.688
I'm confused.
You said it's near a window.

01:01:14.889 --> 01:01:16.770
Oh, that's here!

01:01:18.003 --> 01:01:19.311
Watch.

01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:21.098
Now, it's closed.

01:01:22.028 --> 01:01:23.946
Now, it's open.

01:01:24.985 --> 01:01:26.400
Now, it's closed.

01:01:27.617 --> 01:01:29.162
Now, it's open.

01:01:37.748 --> 01:01:40.291
Do you think it was a real window?

01:01:43.754 --> 01:01:46.856
So you could leave, etc?

01:01:49.436 --> 01:01:52.748
Help me get out of here, Hedwig.

01:01:54.062 --> 01:01:57.123
Just give me the keys and
let me out the door.

01:01:57.223 --> 01:01:59.223
Please.

01:01:59.336 --> 01:02:02.369
Ms. Patricia said that nobody'll make
fun of me anymore when the beast comes.

01:02:02.404 --> 01:02:05.967
She said that everyone must see
how amazing I am.

01:02:06.068 --> 01:02:09.781
And that all of my silly mistakes,
they won't matter anymore.

01:02:10.016 --> 01:02:12.702
- I think you should go back to your room.
- No, wait! Please!

01:02:12.703 --> 01:02:14.618
I wanna hear your Kanye West albums!

01:02:14.619 --> 01:02:18.053
Show me your room! Let's stay here
or I'll still leave!

01:02:18.054 --> 01:02:19.632
I can't.

01:02:19.930 --> 01:02:22.130
You said you wanna show me
something cool, right?

01:02:22.496 --> 01:02:24.044
- Show me something!
- I don't want to!

01:02:24.237 --> 01:02:26.025
Please!

01:02:28.325 --> 01:02:30.425
This!

01:02:39.304 --> 01:02:42.381
- Wow! It's nice.
- It's not a toy.

01:02:48.405 --> 01:02:50.916
- Is this real?
- Yes.

01:02:52.806 --> 01:02:54.745
It's Mr. Dennis'.

01:02:56.257 --> 01:03:01.060
He doesn't even know I stole it.
Pretty cool, right?

01:03:03.905 --> 01:03:07.256
You can listen people talking and
they don't even know you're listening.

01:03:09.966 --> 01:03:12.267
- Who does this talk to?
- Don't touch that.

01:03:13.368 --> 01:03:16.040
I just want to see if it works.

01:03:18.516 --> 01:03:21.063
Hey, don't touch the buttons.
You're gonna get us found out.

01:03:21.064 --> 01:03:23.070
Vince here, whaddup?

01:03:27.805 --> 01:03:29.473
Do not talk.

01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:31.717
Whaddup?

01:03:35.275 --> 01:03:37.002
- Hello?
- Don't!

01:03:37.103 --> 01:03:38.603
Who is this?

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:44.234
Hello? Hello, my name is Casey Cooke!
I'm being held in a basement!

01:03:44.269 --> 01:03:46.441
I've been abducted with two other girls!

01:03:47.431 --> 01:03:49.960
Who the hell is this?

01:03:58.139 --> 01:03:59.911
Hello?

01:04:00.212 --> 01:04:04.858
Casey Cooke! I've been abducted!
You need to find me!

01:04:05.493 --> 01:04:08.438
Betty, is that you?
This isn't fun.

01:04:08.439 --> 01:04:10.775
Call the police! I must be near you.

01:04:10.810 --> 01:04:13.369
I'm being held in a basement
or something.

01:04:13.370 --> 01:04:17.040
<i>Okay, Betty, listen.
Tell Larry to get vicious and I...</i>

01:04:17.175 --> 01:04:19.176
Tell him I still got his own headphones.

01:04:19.526 --> 01:04:23.215
I don't know where I am.
There is a man here.

01:04:23.216 --> 01:04:25.896
He abducted us and
he's going to kill me.

01:04:35.928 --> 01:04:38.054
You may have a few hours left.

01:04:42.496 --> 01:04:43.788
Please.

01:04:45.095 --> 01:04:49.938
I'm begging you.
Somebody save us.

01:04:50.415 --> 01:04:54.546
Who is this? And how did you get
one of our walkies?

01:05:02.908 --> 01:05:05.771
Put your hands together
in contrition.

01:05:07.365 --> 01:05:11.516
"In the sun, we will find our passion."

01:05:13.112 --> 01:05:19.080
"In the sun, we will find our purpose."

01:05:30.215 --> 01:05:34.035
I read that on a sympathy card
in the supermarket.

01:05:34.484 --> 01:05:37.983
It was for funerals, but
I saw it was beautiful.

01:05:43.263 --> 01:05:46.919
Dennis will explain the meaning of
this evening.

01:06:20.819 --> 01:06:24.912
The beast is a scenting creature,

01:06:25.012 --> 01:06:28.919
who represents the highest form of
human evolution.

01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:32.506
He believes the time of ordinary humanity
is over.

01:06:34.811 --> 01:06:37.528
I hope this makes you
feel calm.

01:06:38.632 --> 01:06:43.525
You will be in the presents of
something greater.

01:06:44.109 --> 01:06:48.154
I wish gonna ask you the last shirt,
but I won't.

01:06:49.031 --> 01:06:54.013
Because tonight is a sacred night.
It's almost over.

01:07:02.322 --> 01:07:04.414
Casey, come on!

01:07:05.295 --> 01:07:07.665
Let's pretend we're animals again!

01:07:07.966 --> 01:07:09.225
Come on!

01:07:11.921 --> 01:07:14.395
Casey, come on! This is our game!

01:07:16.444 --> 01:07:19.219
Or I'll tell your dad you're not
being nice.

01:07:38.548 --> 01:07:42.455
Come on! Take off your stuff.
Animals don't wear clothes.

01:07:43.509 --> 01:07:46.725
Come on!

01:08:12.847 --> 01:08:14.696
Hey, Casey-bear.

01:08:17.314 --> 01:08:18.917
This isn't funny.

01:08:23.234 --> 01:08:24.962
Is it loaded?

01:08:27.761 --> 01:08:29.140
Casey?

01:08:30.973 --> 01:08:33.518
I'm your uncle.

01:08:35.417 --> 01:08:36.957
Stop it, Casey!

01:08:38.136 --> 01:08:40.058
Put that gun down!

01:08:40.493 --> 01:08:41.786
I'm getting upset!

01:08:41.986 --> 01:08:45.086
I'm about to get very angry!

01:08:52.094 --> 01:08:54.448
You could've killed me.

01:09:23.783 --> 01:09:27.899
"We need you."

01:10:01.478 --> 01:10:03.926
- This place is closed.
- No, it's okay.

01:10:04.026 --> 01:10:05.353
- You can't get in.
- No, it's okay.

01:10:12.309 --> 01:10:13.838
Hello, Dennis.

01:10:14.038 --> 01:10:18.738
One of the others emailed me just now.

01:10:18.739 --> 01:10:21.522
- Is everything okay?
- We're fine.

01:10:21.687 --> 01:10:25.300
Dennis, Kevin is really lucky to have you.

01:10:26.140 --> 01:10:30.151
You are quite extraordinary.
I just don't want you guys get hurt.

01:10:36.934 --> 01:10:39.550
You think we're extraordinary?

01:10:40.374 --> 01:10:44.051
I like you Dennis.
May I come in?

01:10:44.151 --> 01:10:46.851
And can we talk?

01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:50.773
I know you wanna tell me something.

01:10:51.797 --> 01:10:54.576
Why don't you just tell me?

01:11:09.598 --> 01:11:13.888
We're very similar, you and I.
Both on the outside look and in.

01:11:14.098 --> 01:11:15.917
Please, sit.

01:11:16.703 --> 01:11:20.269
I don't get many visitors.
I'll get you some water.

01:11:21.204 --> 01:11:26.694
They got a proper on the sales ads,
but we're already here.

01:11:27.724 --> 01:11:30.354
They promoted me to make this happen,
so I can have it.

01:11:31.592 --> 01:11:34.173
Who are you going to meet?

01:11:39.191 --> 01:11:42.686
I want to talk about Kevin

01:11:43.835 --> 01:11:48.634
and what his mother did to him.

01:11:49.235 --> 01:11:51.539
I remember the wall.

01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:55.180
I'm happy you're suddenly so open.

01:11:55.297 --> 01:11:59.655
Kevin's mother had read him 11 evil
ways of punishing this 3 year-old.

01:12:00.418 --> 01:12:03.007
- Is that when you arrived in the light?
- Yeah.

01:12:05.424 --> 01:12:07.776
The one way to avoid her attention

01:12:07.806 --> 01:12:11.333
was to keep everything spotless,
everything perfect.

01:12:13.553 --> 01:12:15.954
I know you're coming from
good intention, Dennis.

01:12:16.003 --> 01:12:18.987
But there are other ways
to help Kevin now.

01:12:19.022 --> 01:12:22.693
I've lost so many patients into
the system.

01:12:24.095 --> 01:12:27.624
I want you to know, Dennis.
I will never stop fighting for you.

01:12:27.971 --> 01:12:31.366
My patients have become my family.

01:12:31.812 --> 01:12:35.354
They, what I've chose instead of
a more traditional path.

01:12:35.455 --> 01:12:38.453
I hope you feel you can be truly
honest with me.

01:12:38.554 --> 01:12:41.513
I actually wanna be honest with you.

01:12:43.163 --> 01:12:47.998
I lied before when you asked,
if I'd ever met the beast.

01:12:49.138 --> 01:12:53.096
I said "no.
That really isn't true.

01:12:54.956 --> 01:12:58.576
You wrote about a woman in Germany,

01:12:58.577 --> 01:13:01.119
who'd been blind for 10 years.

01:13:01.330 --> 01:13:05.421
And then, it was discovered that she had
Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID).

01:13:05.422 --> 01:13:09.608
Then three of her identities
developed sight.

01:13:09.762 --> 01:13:15.704
You speculated that her optical nerves
regenerated because of her beliefs.

01:13:16.443 --> 01:13:18.892
What are you trying to say?

01:13:18.893 --> 01:13:22.824
There are things, Dr. Fletcher,
that all of us would find hard to believe.

01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:26.752
Are you trying to tell me
there is a 24th identity?

01:13:26.753 --> 01:13:29.351
You protect the broken.

01:13:29.352 --> 01:13:33.607
When you said this situation
was extraordinary,

01:13:33.686 --> 01:13:36.614
- I knew, you can maybe understand.
- Understand what?

01:13:37.106 --> 01:13:39.053
The beast..

01:13:39.895 --> 01:13:41.971
is real.

01:13:42.826 --> 01:13:46.658
He's just emerged.
You were right about everything.

01:13:47.602 --> 01:13:49.690
What does he look like?

01:13:51.125 --> 01:13:56.262
He is much bigger than I am.
And I'm the biggest of all of us.

01:13:57.008 --> 01:14:00.042
He's tall, he's very muscular.

01:14:01.197 --> 01:14:07.147
He's got a long man hair and his fingers
are twice the length of ours.

01:14:08.684 --> 01:14:11.089
He believes we're extraordinary.

01:14:12.228 --> 01:14:16.810
And we don't represent a mistake, but
our potential.

01:14:19.515 --> 01:14:22.226
You say the same things.

01:14:24.739 --> 01:14:28.148
- He's on the move.
- What's that mean?

01:14:29.581 --> 01:14:33.981
I don't understand.
He can't be real.

01:14:35.465 --> 01:14:39.944
There must be limits to what a human being
can become.

01:14:41.163 --> 01:14:44.433
And there's another whole part
of the story, isn't there?

01:14:45.062 --> 01:14:48.690
About the eating of the impure young?

01:14:48.725 --> 01:14:51.549
What does "impure" even mean?

01:14:52.412 --> 01:14:56.089
We should discuss that, so that you can
understand fully.

01:14:56.205 --> 01:14:59.458
- Understand what?
- Sometimes..

01:15:00.666 --> 01:15:03.326
There's just no other way.

01:15:05.792 --> 01:15:08.974
Who are you going to meet?

01:15:10.283 --> 01:15:12.923
Him.

01:15:17.690 --> 01:15:20.860
You know what, I would love to take notes
on all of this.

01:15:21.614 --> 01:15:25.414
We should probably discuss this
in a proper session tomorrow.

01:15:25.415 --> 01:15:28.519
Really? You're okay with this?

01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:32.309
This has been so wonderful, you're being
so open.

01:15:32.610 --> 01:15:36.307
I can see that you feel very empowered by
the philosophy of the beast.

01:15:36.708 --> 01:15:38.276
I'm going to go now.

01:15:38.577 --> 01:15:40.885
I knew you'd understand.
I'll see ya.

01:15:54.921 --> 01:15:56.655
Would you mind..

01:15:58.651 --> 01:16:00.828
If I use your bathroom?

01:16:03.116 --> 01:16:08.430
No. It's down the hall,
near the stairs on your left.

01:16:13.835 --> 01:16:16.900
- I'll wait you.
- Okay.

01:16:56.932 --> 01:16:59.049
Who are you?

01:17:02.497 --> 01:17:05.121
Who is it?
Help me.

01:17:07.098 --> 01:17:09.238
Help me.
Is someone there?

01:17:10.742 --> 01:17:14.099
- Oh, my God.
- Please, help me!

01:17:16.508 --> 01:17:20.071
They will never reach their potential.
They don't really matter.

01:17:20.072 --> 01:17:21.991
Listen to me, Dennis.

01:17:23.089 --> 01:17:24.895
I should've listened better.

01:17:24.925 --> 01:17:29.054
I should've understood what you
can bluffed how powerful you are.

01:17:29.717 --> 01:17:32.805
Patricia says with your ways of working,

01:17:32.806 --> 01:17:35.562
- The world will understand now.
- Dennis,

01:17:36.037 --> 01:17:39.676
This is wrong.

01:17:40.062 --> 01:17:44.292
These young women are suffering.
This is a crime.

01:17:44.293 --> 01:17:46.729
I can't let you keep them here.

01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:50.628
We've got to stop this.
This identity is monstrous.

01:17:50.729 --> 01:17:52.682
I'm really sad you feel this way.

01:17:52.683 --> 01:17:57.219
Can't you see? He is formed
because of your time in this place?

01:18:24.639 --> 01:18:26.948
There was a lady.

01:18:27.249 --> 01:18:28.765
Someone's here!

01:18:30.488 --> 01:18:32.660
We need to get out of these rooms!

01:18:34.917 --> 01:18:37.542
Is there anything in the room?
Anything that we could use?

01:18:45.784 --> 01:18:47.896
There's nothing in here.

01:18:50.181 --> 01:18:52.263
There is a hanger.

01:19:15.464 --> 01:19:17.625
Thank you, Dennis.

01:19:18.818 --> 01:19:21.033
Here you go, Sir.

01:19:38.579 --> 01:19:42.186
It sounded like there were slide bolts
on the outside of our doors.

01:19:42.936 --> 01:19:46.056
See if you can move the lock through
the crack in the door.

01:20:43.198 --> 01:20:45.453
"Unable to connect to the internet"

01:20:54.859 --> 01:20:57.983
Stay calm, we're getting out of here.

01:20:58.084 --> 01:20:59.803
We're gonna get Casey.

01:21:01.103 --> 01:21:03.103
You can do this, Marcia.

01:21:38.628 --> 01:21:41.073
It's regarded to Chahamanas defeated
Muhammad, of course.

01:21:41.092 --> 01:21:45.028
The conquests between 1192-1200.

01:21:45.229 --> 01:21:49.024
I would like Muhammad to
present ultimatum,

01:21:49.025 --> 01:21:52.815
that Prithviraj "either positize or fight".

01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:56.952
Prithviraj's defines..

01:21:57.474 --> 01:22:03.197
We should stand up to the horde's advances
and face up

01:22:03.198 --> 01:22:05.028
their scared tactic.
We should shook..

01:22:06.281 --> 01:22:08.349
I hate my insulin shots.

01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:13.406
No one else around here has to take them.
Why do I have diabetes?

01:22:14.251 --> 01:22:17.066
All the doctors,
besides Dr. Fletcher,

01:22:17.101 --> 01:22:21.137
say that we're the same person,
just personalities.

01:22:22.681 --> 01:22:25.720
How do you explain I'm the one
who need this? You motherfuck..

01:22:31.286 --> 01:22:34.005
I'm wearing cargo pants in the 90s.

01:22:34.331 --> 01:22:38.532
And a scarf. If it wasn't for
the Varvatos t-shirt underneath,

01:22:38.562 --> 01:22:39.801
that'd be a mess.

01:22:41.578 --> 01:22:44.275
I got notice of something right now.

01:22:45.665 --> 01:22:51.477
I'm worried sick. I have a very
bad feeling that I'm losing time.

01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:53.978
I decide who gets the light, right?

01:22:53.979 --> 01:22:58.705
I think someone is stealing the
light from me when I'm not aware.

01:22:59.945 --> 01:23:03.860
The horde keep obsessing about
the "ones who haven't suffered"..

01:23:03.924 --> 01:23:09.343
I don't know where they're going with this,
but it scares me.

01:24:09.443 --> 01:24:12.072
Think of yourself in a couple hours
at home.

01:24:12.838 --> 01:24:17.463
on the couch in that ugly sweater
that you love.

01:24:28.602 --> 01:24:33.589
It's an animal. He barks like this
when there's a coyote or something.

01:26:13.463 --> 01:26:15.862
Kev.. Kev..
Kev..

01:26:17.254 --> 01:26:19.291
Kev..

01:26:44.635 --> 01:26:49.693
Thank you for
helping us till now.

01:26:55.861 --> 01:26:58.743
Kev.. Kev..

01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:58.996
And yes,
I should tell Dr. Fletcher about this, but..

01:27:59.655 --> 01:28:03.002
She'll worry.
She is such a sweet woman.

01:28:04.702 --> 01:28:07.943
I believe, I will go for a nice walk.

01:28:08.976 --> 01:28:12.173
And think this through organization, like..

01:28:15.085 --> 01:28:19.165
That's my journal for Monday.

01:28:19.366 --> 01:28:21.387
Ciao.

01:29:41.730 --> 01:29:43.541
Claire?

01:29:46.207 --> 01:29:47.318
Marcia?

01:30:09.993 --> 01:30:12.939
Claire! Claire, let's go!

01:31:20.632 --> 01:31:24.367
SAY HIS NAME

01:31:25.058 --> 01:31:27.025
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

01:31:52.805 --> 01:31:54.653
Kevin Wendell Crumb?

01:31:59.412 --> 01:32:00.767
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

01:32:03.618 --> 01:32:05.453
Kevin Wendell Crumb!

01:32:17.455 --> 01:32:22.862
Kevin Wendell Crumb.
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

01:32:23.838 --> 01:32:27.570
You made a mess.
Come out here.

01:32:30.413 --> 01:32:34.125
Kevin Wendell Crumb!
You made a mess!

01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:35.764
Get out there!

01:33:02.271 --> 01:33:05.389
Who are you? Wha..
What's happening?

01:33:07.897 --> 01:33:10.274
Something horrible.

01:33:11.866 --> 01:33:13.685
What I do?

01:33:15.130 --> 01:33:17.206
Did I hurt you?

01:33:24.711 --> 01:33:28.012
Dr. Fletcher.
Dr. Fletcher!

01:33:30.448 --> 01:33:34.895
- Who did that?
- You did.

01:33:36.051 --> 01:33:40.883
I swear, I was on a bus.
I don't remember anything after that.

01:33:42.998 --> 01:33:46.141
Is this still September 18, 2014, right?

01:33:56.984 --> 01:33:59.068
There's a shotgun I bought.

01:34:00.164 --> 01:34:02.971
It's in the bottom cabin that
hidden behind things?

01:34:03.172 --> 01:34:06.172
The shots are in my uniform closet,
out in the service wall.

01:34:09.054 --> 01:34:10.811
Kill me.

01:34:14.189 --> 01:34:16.427
Kill me.

01:34:22.034 --> 01:34:24.330
Whoa, wait, wait, wait!
No, no, don't do that!

01:34:24.428 --> 01:34:26.256
He can't handle reality.

01:34:26.632 --> 01:34:29.519
My name is Jade. Has Dr. Fletcher
been getting our emails?

01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:30.913
This is what we have to do.
We..

01:34:32.204 --> 01:34:34.190
Us in 1008.

01:34:34.191 --> 01:34:38.149
When Anandapala suffered to show his
most crushing defeat

01:34:38.184 --> 01:34:41.563
and Mahmud overrun the entire of Punjab,

01:34:41.564 --> 01:34:44.190
where he's in taking the fame
Temple of Kangra.

01:34:44.355 --> 01:34:48.561
We have been wronged by this alliance,
this horde of

01:34:48.562 --> 01:34:50.710
Patricia, Dennis and the boy.

01:34:51.010 --> 01:34:54.510
Their actions do not represent us!

01:34:56.068 --> 01:34:58.185
Everybody just take a minute!

01:34:59.106 --> 01:35:01.371
Oooh.. Baby girl..

01:35:01.747 --> 01:35:03.973
They've been stealing control
of the light from me,

01:35:04.003 --> 01:35:06.007
but their group are
gonna work through this.

01:35:06.108 --> 01:35:08.476
Honey, my name is Barry.

01:35:18.448 --> 01:35:20.621
You shouldn't've used
the walkie talkie.

01:35:24.625 --> 01:35:27.170
They almost caught us.

01:35:28.131 --> 01:35:30.609
Stop it, Hedwig!

01:35:30.610 --> 01:35:34.817
You never right. Look at you!
You're so afraid in the bud.

01:35:36.352 --> 01:35:40.096
Dennis and Mrs. Patricia
are in charge because of me!

01:35:40.697 --> 01:35:46.630
I'm gonna give the light to them now.
No one is allow to make fun of me anymore!

01:35:59.402 --> 01:36:01.270
Thank you, Hedwig.

01:36:06.276 --> 01:36:09.515
- Everything's fine now.
- Kevin Wendell Crumb.

01:36:12.001 --> 01:36:15.542
Kevin is asleep.
We've made him sleep far away.

01:36:16.348 --> 01:36:18.592
You can call his name all your night,
dear bird,

01:36:19.029 --> 01:36:21.389
but he's not going to hear you.

01:36:21.847 --> 01:36:27.624
The beast has shed with us his dreams
of a larger group to sustain him.

01:36:27.824 --> 01:36:28.824
No!

01:36:29.444 --> 01:36:33.877
Ten to twelve unworthy young
next time.

01:36:35.110 --> 01:36:39.467
This is just the start!

01:37:59.706 --> 01:38:00.847
Let go!

01:38:19.545 --> 01:38:21.042
Oh, my God!

01:38:35.586 --> 01:38:37.297
Help me!

01:38:39.804 --> 01:38:42.047
Help! Help!
Help!

01:39:03.746 --> 01:39:09.712
It runs in our family.
My daddy died, too.

01:39:11.073 --> 01:39:13.157
Same way, heart attack.

01:39:15.049 --> 01:39:18.525
But you don't need to worry.
I'm going to take care of you.

01:39:22.196 --> 01:39:26.596
Well, you won't be given me any trouble,
will you?

01:39:27.945 --> 01:39:30.213
I know you won't, sweety.

01:39:51.444 --> 01:39:53.886
We are glorious!

01:39:55.276 --> 01:39:58.216
We will no longer be afraid!

01:40:08.490 --> 01:40:11.579
Only through pain..

01:40:12.891 --> 01:40:15.447
can you achieve your greatness!

01:40:31.871 --> 01:40:35.333
The impure are the untouched,

01:40:35.952 --> 01:40:39.608
the unburned, the unslain!

01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:45.470
Those who have not been torn,

01:40:45.902 --> 01:40:48.859
have no value in themselves,

01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:52.551
and no place in this world!

01:40:53.584 --> 01:40:57.188
They are asleep!

01:41:17.900 --> 01:41:21.819
Your gun cannot hurt me.

01:41:23.309 --> 01:41:26.590
Can't you see? I am not human.

01:41:28.405 --> 01:41:32.485
Kevin is a man.
I am much more.

01:43:03.637 --> 01:43:07.736
You are different from the rest.

01:43:17.596 --> 01:43:21.413
Your heart is pure.

01:43:23.086 --> 01:43:25.709
Rejoice!

01:43:30.556 --> 01:43:35.734
The broken are the more evolved!

01:43:40.918 --> 01:43:44.058
Rejoice!

01:44:44.178 --> 01:44:46.435
What in the name of Mary-Joseph!

01:44:47.806 --> 01:44:50.302
What are you doing in this area?

01:45:31.331 --> 01:45:34.839
Just keep walking, honey.
They won't do nothing.

01:46:11.113 --> 01:46:12.973
Vince, call the police!

01:46:13.981 --> 01:46:17.145
She said some people got hurt in the area
below maintenance.

01:46:37.898 --> 01:46:39.488
Okay.

01:46:42.488 --> 01:46:45.016
I'm just gonna check you.

01:47:25.392 --> 01:47:27.661
The third deceased name
of Dr. Karen Fletcher.

01:47:27.691 --> 01:47:29.557
Still trying to look out her family.

01:47:47.176 --> 01:47:50.024
Casey Cooke's guardian's here.

01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:01.768
You uncle's here.

01:48:03.441 --> 01:48:05.363
You ready to go?

01:48:54.563 --> 01:48:57.049
And then no through.

01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:05.721
We are what we believe we are.

01:49:10.985 --> 01:49:15.885
Holy shit! This is so cool!

01:49:18.710 --> 01:49:22.449
They're gonna believe we exist now, right?

01:49:24.342 --> 01:49:27.249
They gotta have to.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.716
So, what are we do now?

01:49:34.625 --> 01:49:39.892
We trust in him.
He'll protect us.

01:49:41.892 --> 01:49:45.882
Look, what he can do.

01:49:47.249 --> 01:49:51.361
Let him show the world how powerful
we can be.

01:50:00.566 --> 01:50:02.628
The suspected murderer, Kevin Crumb,

01:50:02.703 --> 01:50:07.044
suffers from the controversial
psychological disorder, DID.

01:50:07.244 --> 01:50:09.985
The rumors coming out of the scene
almost unbelievable.

01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:14.050
There are conflicting stories
if the suspect is alive or dead

01:50:14.151 --> 01:50:17.076
after sustaining 2 point length
gunshot.

01:50:17.176 --> 01:50:18.710
Reports even indicate

01:50:18.745 --> 01:50:22.114
one of his personality is an amalgam of
various animals

01:50:22.149 --> 01:50:24.501
in the Philadelphia Zoo, where he worked.

01:50:24.624 --> 01:50:28.389
The press is already referring to
the alleged attacker by a dork name,

01:50:28.390 --> 01:50:31.131
leaked by a source close to the case.

01:50:31.132 --> 01:50:35.422
Because of his many personalities,
he is being called "The Horde".

01:50:36.869 --> 01:50:39.231
This is like that crazy
guy in the wheelchair

01:50:39.261 --> 01:50:41.032
that they put
away 15 years ago.

01:50:42.026 --> 01:50:44.652
And he gave him a funny name, too.

01:50:45.547 --> 01:50:47.252
What was it?

01:50:47.650 --> 01:50:51.017
- Mr. Glass.
- Oh, yeah.
