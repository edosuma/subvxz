00:41.240 --> 00:44.200
- It's exactly midnight. Happy Halloween!
- Shh!

00:44.280 --> 00:47.240
- Sorry. Happy Halloween!
- Are you ready?

00:52.760 --> 00:53.760
Shh.

01:05.960 --> 01:08.080
You should see your faces.

01:08.800 --> 01:11.360
I heard you planning
your big midnight scare

01:11.440 --> 01:13.440
so I thought I'd get you instead.

01:13.520 --> 01:15.600
Ha! Well, bad luck.

01:15.680 --> 01:18.120
I wasn't in the least bit frightened.

01:18.520 --> 01:22.000
Yeah? Then why are you still
clinging onto Maud?

01:22.760 --> 01:24.720
That was an excellent warm-up.

01:25.600 --> 01:28.000
Now, who's ready for a <i>real </i> ghost story?

01:29.920 --> 01:34.680
But under the hood,
there was nothing. Not even a face.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Your turn, Sybil.

01:41.800 --> 01:46.440
I've heard there's a ghostly ghoul
who lives right here at Cackle's.

01:46.520 --> 01:48.360
- Really?
- Ethel told me.

01:49.120 --> 01:51.920
It's trapped in the top
of the topmost turret,

01:52.480 --> 01:57.080
locked in a hideously haunted chest.

01:57.720 --> 01:59.800
Whoo-oo... whoo!

02:04.520 --> 02:07.560
Don't be a scaredy-bat, Sybil.
It's only Solstice.

02:08.680 --> 02:10.840
I knew that. I just needed some air.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.000
Maybe you should go to bed?

02:14.920 --> 02:17.000
Maybe. It's late.

02:19.720 --> 02:20.720
Come on, then.

02:22.600 --> 02:23.920
We'll see you in the morning.

02:24.080 --> 02:27.400
Night, night, sleep tight.
Don't let the vampires bite.

02:29.720 --> 02:32.080
Now, time to get really scary.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.440
But under the hood, there was nothing.

02:38.760 --> 02:41.840
- You're not funny, Enid.
- That wasn't me.

02:43.840 --> 02:47.040
- Cut it out, Maud.
- I didn't do anything, I swear.

02:47.680 --> 02:48.680
Really and truly?

02:49.320 --> 02:50.760
Really and truly.

02:50.840 --> 02:55.120
Then, who or what is making that noise?

03:24.720 --> 03:28.760
<i>♪ Take this warning and be wise ♪</i>

03:28.840 --> 03:33.320
<i>♪ Forget him who brought you sorrow ♪</i>

03:33.960 --> 03:38.280
<i>♪ Dry your sad and teary eyes... ♪</i>

03:38.360 --> 03:40.120
How many times?

03:40.200 --> 03:43.120
I did not forget our anniversary!

03:43.840 --> 03:47.080
Please,
just give me a chance to explain.

03:47.160 --> 03:50.040
Woe, woe, woe...

03:50.440 --> 03:53.280
We've got to do something. Put this right.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.720
A witch should never meddle
in affairs of the heart.

03:55.800 --> 03:59.120
Remember how happy Miss Bat was
when Mr. Rowan-Webb came out the pond?

03:59.200 --> 04:03.120
And remember how he'd forgotten everything
except how important she was?

04:03.200 --> 04:05.040
- I suppose.
- It's settled, then.

04:05.480 --> 04:07.400
We'll do whatever we can to help Miss Bat.

04:07.480 --> 04:10.200
- Wait, I never said...
- It's okay, Maud. Relax.

04:10.280 --> 04:13.160
Sometimes people need a little help
getting the magic back.

04:17.720 --> 04:20.839
Creepy crepes?
Baked eyeball eggs? Slime-ade?

04:20.920 --> 04:24.600
And that's just breakfast.
Tonight's feast is going to be epic.

04:29.840 --> 04:31.720
Are you sure this is going to work, Enid?

04:39.440 --> 04:40.440
Absolutely.

04:41.120 --> 04:44.520
Just pour a dash of this emotion potion
into Miss Bat's porridge

04:44.600 --> 04:46.560
and she'll be hat over heels
all over again.

04:49.360 --> 04:51.920
<i>Flying ever higher on the wings of a dove.</i>

04:52.200 --> 04:55.280
<i>With the next wizard you see,
You will fall in love.</i>

05:01.240 --> 05:02.920
Miss Bat, I got you some porridge.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.640
Oh, thank you, dear,

05:05.440 --> 05:07.120
but I couldn't eat a thing.

05:10.640 --> 05:11.640
Enid.

05:12.040 --> 05:13.680
Enid, take a seat.

05:23.640 --> 05:25.800
Who's ready for some slime-ade?

05:34.520 --> 05:35.520
Happy Halloween.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.880
Happy Halloween.

05:45.280 --> 05:46.360
<i>Morning.</i>

05:46.440 --> 05:49.120
- Oh, morning, Sybil. Did you sleep okay?
- Yep.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.640
We stayed up all night.

05:51.720 --> 05:54.040
Making up stories
about the hideously haunted chest.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.440
Sounds great.

05:56.600 --> 05:57.840
You are silly, Sybil.

05:58.240 --> 06:00.680
Yeah.
Witches aren't afraid of ghosts.

06:09.920 --> 06:11.760
Why isn't anything happening?

06:11.840 --> 06:14.120
Maybe the potion's
past its spell-by-date?

06:14.200 --> 06:16.280
Or maybe I got the words mixed up?

06:16.360 --> 06:19.680
Well, sparks should be flying by now
so something's definitely gone wrong.

06:25.880 --> 06:26.880
Humph!

06:37.080 --> 06:38.360
- Esme!
- Ethel!

06:38.880 --> 06:41.160
Oh, I'm glad to see you.

06:41.840 --> 06:44.440
But sad we'll be saying
goodbye again after the feast.

06:44.520 --> 06:45.880
Maybe. Maybe not.

06:45.960 --> 06:48.920
Oh, I know you're struggling,
but it would mean a lot if...

06:49.000 --> 06:53.840
I mean, maybe you won't have to leave
and go to a non-magical school.

06:53.920 --> 06:55.520
What are you talking about?

06:56.040 --> 06:58.440
I've been trying to tell you
for weeks and weeks

06:58.520 --> 07:02.200
but Mum and Dad were always there
and I missed your last visit.

07:02.800 --> 07:07.280
I can definitely, 100 percent,
get you your powers back.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.040
What? How?

07:15.720 --> 07:19.920
Halloween is such a wonderful
time of year for witches.

07:20.440 --> 07:25.200
That is why I have something
rather smashing lined up.

07:26.520 --> 07:27.600
Ahem!

07:28.240 --> 07:30.640
That must be our very special delivery.

07:37.120 --> 07:38.760
- Wow!
- Great!

07:41.480 --> 07:44.480
- Who's ready for some carving?
- Whoo!

07:53.920 --> 07:57.360
What a majestic creature.

07:57.440 --> 07:59.200
I must capture your essence.

07:59.800 --> 08:00.800
Don't move.

08:04.680 --> 08:07.240
He's a walking, talking
work of art.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.680
Who? Me?

08:09.240 --> 08:11.520
Who else?

08:11.600 --> 08:12.600
Hmm!

08:13.560 --> 08:18.160
Mother always said a big nose
never spoiled a handsome face.

08:19.680 --> 08:23.720
I must choose the right shade
for those beautiful brown eyes.

08:24.240 --> 08:27.040
- What's happening?
- You don't think it's the potion?

08:27.120 --> 08:30.160
It can't be.
They drank the juice ages ago.

08:30.560 --> 08:33.919
Maybe the magic took longer to work
'cause it got diluted.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.880
Smoky topaz, it is.

08:36.559 --> 08:39.720
And shell pink for those luscious lips.

08:40.280 --> 08:41.280
Hmm?

08:45.480 --> 08:48.640
- Why are you bringing me here?
- All that bother with the Magic Council

08:48.720 --> 08:51.920
means it's more important than ever
that we restore the family name.

09:02.080 --> 09:04.800
Ta-da! Don't say
I never do anything for you.

09:05.360 --> 09:08.480
- What is it?
- It's the Founding Stone of the school.

09:08.560 --> 09:11.240
It'll give you your powers back.

09:11.320 --> 09:14.520
Might even make you more powerful
than you were before.

09:14.600 --> 09:16.920
Oh, no, Ethel. What have you done?

09:20.760 --> 09:23.560
I need you to keep completely still
while I paint you.

09:24.920 --> 09:27.520
- Do you know what's going on?
- Where's Ethel?

09:27.600 --> 09:30.320
Esme's here so she's been excused
from class this morning.

09:31.280 --> 09:34.640
I may have accidentally given
all the teachers a love potion.

09:34.720 --> 09:36.200
So that's why.

09:36.880 --> 09:39.720
"With the next wizard she saw,
she fell in love."

09:40.280 --> 09:42.200
If the spell specifies "wizard."

09:43.880 --> 09:44.880
Of course!

09:46.640 --> 09:49.800
We've got to keep the school's
only wizard away from the teachers

09:49.880 --> 09:51.280
until the magic wears off.

09:51.360 --> 09:52.480
What about Miss Bat?

09:54.560 --> 09:55.560
Okay.

09:56.440 --> 09:58.400
But you've got to bring her here quickly.

10:01.120 --> 10:03.160
What we can contain, we can control.

10:04.440 --> 10:07.360
Thing is, I'm actually waiting

10:08.040 --> 10:11.480
for an important delivery, so...

10:13.120 --> 10:14.680
No! My muse!

10:18.880 --> 10:19.880
Follow her, Felice!

10:19.920 --> 10:23.320
Come on, Enid, we've got to find
Mr. Rowan-Webb before anyone else does.

10:26.800 --> 10:30.000
It's totally against the Code
to tamper with the Founding Stone.

10:31.080 --> 10:34.000
I took the Stone ages ago
and nothing's happened.

10:34.120 --> 10:36.440
Ages ago?
Then why isn't anyone looking for it?

10:36.520 --> 10:39.640
Because everything's fine.
I replaced it with a fake.

10:39.720 --> 10:42.080
I finally perfected my cloning spell.

10:51.480 --> 10:52.480
Here you are.

10:54.640 --> 10:59.160
My first-years are on decorating duty
so I thought I'd take a break.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.440
Are you all right?

11:04.560 --> 11:06.320
Not really, dear. You see...

11:07.640 --> 11:10.720
yesterday was a very important day for me.

11:11.760 --> 11:12.760
Oh.

11:14.800 --> 11:18.200
I met Mr. Rowan-Webb many moons ago.

11:18.560 --> 11:20.680
Night before Hallows' Eve.

11:22.560 --> 11:24.520
There was a party at my college.

11:25.760 --> 11:30.520
We wore masks so you couldn't tell
which witch was which.

11:33.680 --> 11:35.840
But he only had eyes for me.

11:39.880 --> 11:43.640
We are born with two legs, two arms,

11:43.720 --> 11:46.000
two ears, two eyes...

11:47.320 --> 11:49.560
but only one heart.

11:52.240 --> 11:54.840
Because we're supposed to find
the other one.

12:01.240 --> 12:03.600
Esme! It's so good to see you.

12:05.480 --> 12:07.800
Well met, Beatrice. Well met, Clarice.

12:07.880 --> 12:08.920
Well met.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.520
Your first Halloween at Cackle's.
You must be so excited.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.480
It's the best time to be a witch.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.760
I did it again, didn't I?

12:20.360 --> 12:22.200
It's okay. You're right.

12:23.320 --> 12:25.800
- We'd better get on.
- Yeah.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.320
Where did you both come from?

12:33.960 --> 12:34.960
Nowhere.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.720
You haven't been up
in that turret, have you?

12:37.800 --> 12:41.320
Ethel says there's a ghostly ghoul
who's trapped in a chest.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.880
There was. Is.

12:46.360 --> 12:50.280
We were just checking
if it was still trapped.

12:50.680 --> 12:53.160
Oh, but you mustn't go up there.
It's not safe.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.240
- Do you hear me, Sybil?
- Okay.

12:59.560 --> 13:02.040
He said something about a delivery.

13:02.680 --> 13:03.680
There he is!

13:03.840 --> 13:04.880
Ah.

13:04.960 --> 13:06.280
Miss Hardbroom, stop!

13:07.280 --> 13:10.760
- No shouting in the corridors.
- Pardon me, Miss Hardbroom.

13:12.720 --> 13:15.480
- And categorically no running.
- Sorry, Miss Hardbroom.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.920
Enid Nightshade!

13:23.000 --> 13:25.480
Have you taken leave of your senses?

13:31.120 --> 13:32.120
Hmm.

13:32.720 --> 13:34.640
Sorry, I didn't see you there.

13:36.160 --> 13:39.920
Probably because you lack personality,
presence, charm.

13:40.680 --> 13:43.840
Wha... what is wrong
with everyone today?

13:45.560 --> 13:48.880
It's okay. I think the potion's worn off.

13:49.520 --> 13:50.520
I'm not so sure.

13:50.840 --> 13:53.200
I think this might be
how Miss Hardbroom flirts.

13:53.280 --> 13:57.560
All men are fools,
but you are their king.

14:00.280 --> 14:01.280
There you are!

14:05.160 --> 14:06.760
That's it. I'm out of here.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.880
- No! Not again!
- Come back this instant!

14:19.040 --> 14:21.880
What we can contain, we can control.

14:27.520 --> 14:28.680
Algernon?

14:32.360 --> 14:34.400
What is going on?

14:34.480 --> 14:38.040
It... it's hard to explain.

14:38.120 --> 14:39.120
Try me.

14:47.240 --> 14:50.960
<i>Et tu, </i> Dimity?

14:57.560 --> 14:59.880
Okay. Let's start at the beginning.

15:02.040 --> 15:03.600
How did you find the Stone?

15:03.680 --> 15:06.160
I took it from Sybil's room
after the fire.

15:06.680 --> 15:09.040
- Why did Sybil have it?
- That's not important.

15:10.040 --> 15:14.000
<i>I took it, cloned it, and put
the copied one back where it belongs.</i>

15:14.080 --> 15:16.320
Let this Stone be where it wants.

15:16.920 --> 15:20.680
Not this place, but two at once.

15:22.440 --> 15:24.560
I cloned myself too
so I could go and tell you,

15:24.640 --> 15:26.440
but that all went wrong.

15:27.200 --> 15:28.200
It's really easy.

15:28.960 --> 15:30.320
I found this old spell.

15:31.240 --> 15:33.760
<i>"My powers have gone,
my powers have flown,</i>

15:33.840 --> 15:36.560
Share with me your powers,
oh, gracious Stone."

15:40.640 --> 15:41.760
I'm sorry, Ethel.

15:41.840 --> 15:44.680
- It's not that I'm not grateful, but...
- But what?

15:45.520 --> 15:48.440
My principles are more important
than my powers.

15:49.400 --> 15:50.400
Right.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.040
Great.

15:52.160 --> 15:55.480
In that case,
I'm sorry I wasted your time and mine.

15:55.560 --> 15:56.560
Ethel.

15:56.960 --> 15:58.520
We'd better get a move on.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.000
You've got a lot of people
to say goodbye to.

16:01.080 --> 16:04.160
A lot of people who care about you,
who want you to do well.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.960
Hey, look at this.

16:17.040 --> 16:18.920
Please! Yeah, very good.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.320
- Will you just leave me alone?
- On the shoulders.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.640
- Oh! Back to my knees.
- Very good.

16:25.720 --> 16:28.440
- You've never seen skills like this.
- Please, will you just...

16:28.520 --> 16:29.440
On my nose.

16:29.520 --> 16:31.000
Around the world.

16:32.560 --> 16:34.560
Algy, darling!

16:35.920 --> 16:36.960
You've forgiven me?

16:37.040 --> 16:41.120
Of course, my love.
I'd forgive you anything.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.400
Oh, Gwen, I...

16:49.480 --> 16:51.600
- Who's that?
- Who, dearest?

16:52.040 --> 16:55.680
Only the most gorgeous wizard
in the whole wide...

16:56.760 --> 16:59.680
Hello, you.

17:01.560 --> 17:03.640
He's fallen in love with himself?

17:03.720 --> 17:07.560
He's the first wizard he saw, so...

17:09.560 --> 17:12.640
Me and Millie will deal with
Mr. Rowan-Webb. You distract the others.

17:12.720 --> 17:13.720
How?

17:17.000 --> 17:20.200
Oh, my knee!
I think it's broken!

17:20.280 --> 17:22.119
Oh!

17:23.079 --> 17:24.800
Don't move, Enid.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.240
We think it's broken!

17:34.520 --> 17:36.360
Let's get him inside the classroom.

17:38.680 --> 17:41.920
Oh, come back,
you handsome devil, you. Rr-rr!

17:49.600 --> 17:53.120
Can I borrow a kiss?
I promise I'll give it back.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.240
What do we do now?

17:55.320 --> 17:58.040
Leave and hope no one finds him
before the potion wears off.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.360
You think he'll stay?

17:59.440 --> 18:01.560
You. Yes, you.

18:01.920 --> 18:05.960
Could you please stop being
quite so adorable?

18:06.520 --> 18:07.960
He's not going anywhere.

18:14.440 --> 18:15.760
Esme!

18:16.520 --> 18:18.800
Oh. Well met, Mildred. Well met, Maud.

18:19.080 --> 18:21.400
You haven't seen
any of the teachers, have you?

18:21.480 --> 18:22.480
- Nuh-uh.
- Nope.

18:23.280 --> 18:25.480
Just wanted to say a few goodbyes.

18:25.560 --> 18:29.160
Esme's supposed to be starting
her non-magical school next week.

18:29.240 --> 18:31.360
- Oh, no.
- It's not that bad, honest.

18:32.120 --> 18:35.760
- If there's anything you want to know...
- Like she'd want advice from you.

18:36.240 --> 18:39.440
Actually, I do have a few questions,
if you don't mind.

18:39.760 --> 18:40.880
'Course not.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.600
I'll stay here, keep watch.

18:58.240 --> 19:01.720
I've tried netball and catching a bus.

19:02.480 --> 19:04.880
But everything else will be new.

19:05.320 --> 19:07.800
You'll be a bit like me
when I started at Cackle's.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.440
Behind in every subject.

19:11.120 --> 19:12.560
You've caught up now, though.

19:13.480 --> 19:14.920
I don't know about that.

19:15.440 --> 19:18.120
But I do know that friends
are the most important thing,

19:18.200 --> 19:20.200
and you're bound to make plenty of those.

19:20.280 --> 19:21.280
Please.

19:22.280 --> 19:23.880
Why don't we meet up later?

19:24.760 --> 19:25.880
Fine. Whatever.

19:28.360 --> 19:32.320
Will you come to my room, then?
I need to ask you a bit of a favor.

19:44.280 --> 19:49.200
<i>Beetles' breath and myrtle flower,
keep my sister in this tower.</i>

19:49.840 --> 19:54.840
<i>In this room, she must dwell,
until her magic can break the spell.</i>

20:09.320 --> 20:14.760
What we can contain, we can control.
What we can contain, we can control...

20:18.600 --> 20:20.320
Uh... can I help you?

20:20.720 --> 20:24.600
- I'm looking for Mr. Rowan-Webb.
- As am I.

20:25.720 --> 20:28.120
He's not here at the moment, but...

20:28.200 --> 20:31.320
I can see you
sneaking a peek at me.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.880
I also need a quick word.

20:33.960 --> 20:35.960
A rather pressing matter.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.280
Stay back! All of you!

20:39.400 --> 20:41.520
What on earth is going on?

20:44.960 --> 20:45.960
Maud?

20:52.560 --> 20:54.560
I wonder what Miss Drill's got up to?

20:54.640 --> 20:56.920
You don't think
the ghostly ghoul's got her?

20:58.240 --> 21:00.840
Don't worry,
Esme told me it's still trapped.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.960
You know they made that all up?

21:05.640 --> 21:08.240
- Esme wouldn't lie.
- Really? Prove it.

21:08.960 --> 21:09.960
How can I?

21:10.160 --> 21:12.200
Go up to the turret and see for yourself.

21:12.280 --> 21:13.960
- Hmm?
- Okay.

21:15.160 --> 21:16.160
I will.

21:20.400 --> 21:21.400
You'll be all right.

21:21.760 --> 21:24.280
Just remember,
witches aren't afraid of ghosts.

21:27.680 --> 21:29.080
No, Miss Cackle, don't!

21:29.160 --> 21:32.440
Thank you, Mildred.
But forewarned is forearmed.

21:32.520 --> 21:37.560
Twenty-seven, 28...
I know you like this technique.

21:37.640 --> 21:39.800
- Oh, so magnificent!
- Twenty-nine...

21:40.240 --> 21:41.240
Thirty...

21:42.400 --> 21:44.400
Such exquisite bone structure.

21:55.560 --> 21:58.640
- Well, that was embarrassing.
- Is that the time?

21:58.720 --> 22:00.360
I really must fly.

22:05.280 --> 22:08.480
Oh, Gwen, wait. I have got you something.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.840
It only arrived this morning.

22:12.520 --> 22:14.720
I so wanted you to have it yesterday,

22:15.120 --> 22:17.800
but, well, you know what
snail mail is like.

22:17.880 --> 22:20.880
A bit sluggish.

22:25.760 --> 22:27.160
You see, Mildred,

22:27.880 --> 22:31.160
a witch should never meddle
in affairs of the heart.

22:34.960 --> 22:36.040
Oh-hh!

22:36.600 --> 22:40.040
It's the same butterfly mask...

22:41.440 --> 22:45.520
that you wore to bewitch me
all those years ago.

22:49.440 --> 22:50.440
So...

22:51.720 --> 22:53.320
you didn't forget?

22:53.400 --> 22:55.200
I couldn't. I wouldn't.

22:56.520 --> 23:01.520
Never mind butterflies,
I feel the whole zoo when I'm with you.

23:02.200 --> 23:03.200
Oh-hh!

23:04.360 --> 23:07.200
Looks like they didn't need
your help, after all.

23:11.720 --> 23:14.120
Witches aren't afraid of ghosts.

23:17.600 --> 23:20.040
Witches aren't afraid of ghosts.

23:35.480 --> 23:38.640
The hideously haunted chest.

23:59.400 --> 24:01.160
It's fine. I've left anyway.

24:01.560 --> 24:03.960
It won't matter
if I get caught taking the Stone back.

24:04.040 --> 24:05.040
Thanks, sis.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.560
Why are you being so nice?

24:17.360 --> 24:18.840
It's really not like you.

24:20.160 --> 24:22.440
You never said why you took the Stone.

24:22.520 --> 24:24.320
I wanted things to be normal again.

24:25.440 --> 24:27.080
- What things?
- Everything.

24:27.440 --> 24:30.040
Like the fact that Mother
isn't talking to you right now?

24:30.560 --> 24:34.280
Can you believe she blames me for what
happened to you? It's totally unfair.

24:34.360 --> 24:37.160
So this was all about you
getting back in Mother's good books?

24:37.720 --> 24:39.320
You saving the family name?

24:40.880 --> 24:42.080
Sorry to disappoint.

24:47.880 --> 24:50.280
Help! Help me, I'm trapped!

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Please!

24:56.040 --> 24:57.040
Hello?

24:57.600 --> 24:58.960
Help! Please!

24:59.320 --> 25:00.680
Can anybody hear me?

25:03.840 --> 25:06.960
Mildred! We've been looking for you.
We're a bit worried...

25:07.040 --> 25:09.160
Beatrice is. I'm sure she's fine.

25:09.240 --> 25:11.920
- Sorry, what are you talking about?
- It's Sybil.

25:12.240 --> 25:13.400
She's gone missing.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.120
They think Sybil's gone
to the turret.

25:30.200 --> 25:31.920
Looking for a "ghostly ghoul."

25:32.000 --> 25:35.200
They don't admit it, but they're
too scared to look for her themselves.

25:35.280 --> 25:36.720
I told them I'd handle it.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Ethel?

25:54.840 --> 25:56.280
What was all that about?

25:56.680 --> 25:58.400
You stay here. I'll find out.

26:05.920 --> 26:08.480
Ethel, I'm gonna kill you
for making me do this.

26:08.560 --> 26:10.920
Help! Please! Help!

26:13.560 --> 26:17.520
- Hello? Please! Help!
- Sybil! What are you doing out there?

26:18.680 --> 26:20.320
No, no, stop! I said stop!

26:20.440 --> 26:22.440
Hold on! Hold on! Sybil!

26:22.520 --> 26:24.240
Esme, don't leave me!

26:27.480 --> 26:29.280
Help! Help!

26:32.720 --> 26:36.120
Esme! I can't hold on! Help!

26:37.560 --> 26:39.160
Help me, please!

26:40.920 --> 26:42.760
Esme! Hurry up!

26:43.480 --> 26:45.960
<i>My powers have gone,
my powers have flown.</i>

26:46.040 --> 26:48.640
<i>Share with me your powers,
O, gracious Stone.</i>

26:49.280 --> 26:51.400
I'm falling! Please, help!

27:04.160 --> 27:06.000
I heard a scream. Is everyone okay?

27:06.080 --> 27:07.880
This is none of your business.

27:08.240 --> 27:10.080
Why did you bring Sybil here?

27:10.160 --> 27:12.240
She was on the roof. She fell.

27:12.880 --> 27:14.080
Esme saved me.

27:14.640 --> 27:15.920
You've got your magic back?

27:17.720 --> 27:20.200
I took it from the Stone. I had no choice.
