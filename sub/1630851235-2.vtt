WEBVTT

01:20.167 --> 01:21.168
And in other news,

01:21.211 --> 01:22.734
this Hollywood Prop Museum

01:22.778 --> 01:25.389
is set for a grand reopening
this week.

01:25.433 --> 01:27.130
-I'll bid 10,000.

01:27.174 --> 01:28.827
-I'll bid 30,000.

01:28.871 --> 01:30.655
-Each year, millions
of dollars change hands as

01:30.699 --> 01:33.963
collectors seek to curate
relics of movie history.

01:34.006 --> 01:37.271
Everyone from average moviegoers
to world-class collectors will

01:37.314 --> 01:40.796
be in attendance this Friday
on Hollywood Boulevard.

01:40.839 --> 01:43.668
Rumors surrounding Lampini's
Skeletons in the Closet

01:43.712 --> 01:45.105
have been rattling
the competition

01:45.148 --> 01:46.497
ahead of the premiere.

01:46.541 --> 01:49.021
This is surely an
exhibition to die for.

01:51.720 --> 01:52.851
-Woo!

01:54.766 --> 01:55.898
Come on, Burke, show me.

01:57.639 --> 01:59.945
What's in the box?

01:59.989 --> 02:01.599
- Balls.

02:01.643 --> 02:04.385
- Yeah, you got balls.
Spill it!

02:05.255 --> 02:08.084
Oh my god!

02:08.128 --> 02:10.130
- Voila!

02:10.173 --> 02:13.829
- Sweet.

02:13.872 --> 02:16.136
If it's real.
- Oh, 100% it's authentic.

02:16.179 --> 02:17.789
- Eep!
- Coscarelli's mother had this

02:17.833 --> 02:20.183
in her attic
for the past 40 years.

02:20.227 --> 02:22.446
Doting moms, they're a
collector's wet dream.

02:22.490 --> 02:23.926
- True, that.

02:23.969 --> 02:26.929
- So, uh, where's the boss man?
- Where else?

02:26.972 --> 02:30.498
In his lab, working out
some last-minute details.

02:30.541 --> 02:32.630
Premiere is in two days.
Can you believe it?

02:32.674 --> 02:35.285
He put his heart and
soul into this place.

02:35.329 --> 02:37.853
Not to mention every last
dime his father left him.

02:37.896 --> 02:39.898
It'll kill him if this bombs.

02:39.942 --> 02:42.205
- Well, if he does
decide to drop dead,

02:42.249 --> 02:43.902
maybe me and you could elope.

02:43.946 --> 02:47.297
- Sorry, Burke.
You'll never have what he has.

02:47.341 --> 02:49.212
- And what is that?

02:49.256 --> 02:51.475
- Magic.
From the moment we met,

02:51.519 --> 02:54.522
it's like we've been
two peas in a giant seed pod.

02:54.565 --> 02:58.482
- If you say so.
Well, look, I'm out of here.

02:58.526 --> 03:00.528
Oh, and if you happen
to see Mr. Seed Pod,

03:00.571 --> 03:03.357
let him know I got a line on the
hero face hugger from "Alien."

03:03.400 --> 03:06.229
- Will do! Hasta la vista, baby!

03:06.273 --> 03:08.710
- Hey, you
probably shouldn't touch this.

03:08.753 --> 03:10.451
-Just chill, who cares?
She won't notice.

03:10.494 --> 03:13.584
- Yo! Dipshit! Hands off!

03:13.628 --> 03:15.282
When you visit the Louvre,

03:15.325 --> 03:17.240
do they let you fondle
the Mona Lisa?

03:17.284 --> 03:18.589
- Who?

03:18.633 --> 03:21.157
- The Mona Lisa,
the famous painting?

03:21.201 --> 03:22.898
Do you think they
let you touch it?

03:22.941 --> 03:26.031
Spoiler alert: there's a giant
fucking sign that says

03:26.075 --> 03:28.773
keep your fucking hands off
the fucking art.

03:28.817 --> 03:30.558
- Chill, lady, it's just dust.

03:30.601 --> 03:32.734
- Hey, maybe we could snort it.

03:32.777 --> 03:34.736
- Maybe
we could snort it?

03:34.779 --> 03:35.998
Maybe you two assholes

03:36.041 --> 03:37.913
could just choose
to get out right now.

03:37.956 --> 03:40.742
- You must choose,
but choose wisely.

03:40.785 --> 03:45.181
I got this. No problem.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.705
- What's her problem?

03:47.749 --> 03:51.709
- No problem.
She's just protecting the art.

03:51.753 --> 03:55.365
Now, this chalice was rumored
to bestow eternal life

03:55.409 --> 03:58.020
upon anyone that drank from it.

03:58.063 --> 04:00.718
It's part of
motion picture history.

04:00.762 --> 04:04.244
In the same way, props
bring eternal life to movies.

04:04.287 --> 04:05.897
They're immortal.

04:05.941 --> 04:09.292
Unlike stars themselves,
props never die.

04:09.336 --> 04:11.120
Look around.

04:11.163 --> 04:15.255
These pieces weren't
generated in a computer.

04:15.298 --> 04:18.214
They were handcrafted
by artisans.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.782
They have heart and soul.

04:20.825 --> 04:24.525
Just think, what would
Freddie be without his glove?

04:24.568 --> 04:28.224
Hm? Or a star captain
without his chair?

04:28.268 --> 04:30.531
And old Norman Bates couldn't
very well become his own mother

04:30.574 --> 04:32.054
without the proper wig.

04:32.097 --> 04:34.099
- Baby, you forgot
to say spoiler alert.

04:34.143 --> 04:36.537
- I didn't forget.
Everybody's seen "Psycho."

04:36.580 --> 04:38.278
You two have seen "Psycho."
- Vince Vaughn, yo.

04:38.321 --> 04:41.542
- Oh, Jesus.
I just swallowed my own vomit.

04:42.673 --> 04:44.153
- Hey, what's back there?

04:44.196 --> 04:47.504
- Ah, ah, ah!

04:47.548 --> 04:49.201
No spoilers.

04:49.245 --> 04:53.336
You'll have to hold out
for our world premiere.

04:53.380 --> 04:55.295
I know you're
really gonna dig it.

05:19.884 --> 05:22.887
- Fuck!

05:22.931 --> 05:25.890
- Hey! What's with the puss?

05:25.934 --> 05:29.720
- I just got boned.
Outbid at the last second.

05:29.764 --> 05:32.027
By who else?
- Bateman.

05:32.070 --> 05:37.380
- He's my Khan.
Khaaaaaaan!

05:37.424 --> 05:38.990
- What was it?

05:39.034 --> 05:40.252
- David Warner's decapitated
head from "The Omen."

05:40.296 --> 05:43.430
- Oh babe, I'm so sorry.

05:43.473 --> 05:45.823
- Love means never having
to say you're sorry.

05:45.867 --> 05:48.478
- Mm? Cooper drives
the boat, Chief.

05:48.522 --> 05:50.219
- Mm.

05:53.570 --> 05:56.791
- So, what does this guy
have against you, anyway?

05:56.834 --> 06:01.665
- Not me. My dad.
Started before I was even born.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.145
I was--

06:03.188 --> 06:08.106
I just inherited the grudge.

06:08.150 --> 06:10.892
- Bateman knew your father?
- Yup.

06:10.935 --> 06:16.811
They were rival collectors
back in the pre-Comic-Con days.

06:16.854 --> 06:19.944
He desperately wanted
something he had,

06:19.988 --> 06:22.512
and Pop refused
to give it to him.

06:22.556 --> 06:25.385
- Let me guess:
the flux capacitor.

06:25.428 --> 06:28.997
- No. My mother.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.434
She was uniquely beautiful.

06:31.478 --> 06:35.133
Pop called her a masterpiece.

06:35.177 --> 06:39.399
The two of them met working at
the Magic Castle in Hollywood.

06:39.442 --> 06:43.446
Uh, Pop was a table magician
and Mom worked the coat check.

06:43.490 --> 06:45.361
- So it runs in the family.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.494
- What's that?
- Magic.

06:47.537 --> 06:51.454
- Well, not quite.
Pop's magic was real.

06:51.498 --> 06:57.417
He had a way of--well,
bringing his props to life.

06:57.460 --> 06:59.723
I'm not even in the same league.

06:59.767 --> 07:04.728
But, I did manage to get my
hands on my own masterpiece.

07:04.772 --> 07:08.515
- Well...

07:08.558 --> 07:11.474
Bateman can keep David Warner's
decapitated head.

07:11.518 --> 07:13.476
He'll never have what you have.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.869
So...

07:19.613 --> 07:21.484
You wanna do it in
the captain's chair?

07:24.356 --> 07:26.837
- Affirmative!

07:38.719 --> 07:41.896
- Hello, gorgeous.

07:44.551 --> 07:46.727
-Good evening.
- Hello.

07:48.903 --> 07:51.949
We're actually closing up shop
in a few moments, but, uh,

07:51.993 --> 07:53.516
pop back in tomorrow
for the world premiere

07:53.560 --> 07:55.344
of our brand-new exhibit.

07:55.387 --> 07:56.998
- New exhibit indeed.

07:59.217 --> 08:01.350
Well, from the look of it,

08:01.393 --> 08:03.483
a few minutes should be
more than adequate.

08:03.526 --> 08:07.704
- Well, I'm gonna have
to charge you full price.

08:07.748 --> 08:09.140
- Full price it is.

08:30.814 --> 08:33.991
- This here is Bruce Campbell's
chainsaw used in "Evil Dead 2."

08:34.035 --> 08:35.993
- Hm.

08:36.037 --> 08:37.778
That one right there?

08:37.821 --> 08:39.562
Dennis Hopper's screen-used
chainsaw

08:39.606 --> 08:41.346
from "Texas Chainsaw
Massacre 2."

08:44.524 --> 08:48.353
- What's so funny?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.

08:48.397 --> 08:49.964
- You don't seem very impressed.

08:50.007 --> 08:52.532
- I would be if you told me
there was the actual chainsaw

08:52.575 --> 08:54.708
used by Gunnar Hansen
in the original

08:54.751 --> 08:57.711
"Texas Chainsaw Massacre."

08:57.754 --> 09:01.845
"Chainsaw 2"? Sequelitis.
It's a disease.

09:04.631 --> 09:06.458
- You're preaching to
the converted, bub.

09:17.644 --> 09:19.297
- Aaah!

09:19.341 --> 09:23.606
Unfortunately, the original
chainsaw no longer exists.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.826
- Oh? I beg to differ.

09:32.746 --> 09:37.054
Personally acquired from
the Tobe Hooper Estate.

09:37.098 --> 09:38.360
- Holy shit!

09:38.403 --> 09:39.927
- If that could
be authenticated,

09:39.970 --> 09:41.711
I might be interested in
taking it off your hands.

09:41.755 --> 09:43.931
- You
couldn't afford it.

09:43.974 --> 09:45.367
- Maybe not in cash.

09:45.410 --> 09:47.282
- What else did
you have in mind?

09:47.325 --> 09:49.327
- Hey, watch the
eyes there, ponytail.

09:49.371 --> 09:52.809
- Danielle?
Show him the shoe.

09:54.332 --> 09:56.030
- Worn by Rosa Klebb in
"From Russia with Love."

09:56.073 --> 09:57.292
The last surviving pair.

09:57.335 --> 09:59.990
- Cute.
- Cute?

10:00.034 --> 10:01.949
- I recently acquired a
Little Nellie gyrocopter

10:01.992 --> 10:03.385
from "You Only Live Twice."

10:03.428 --> 10:06.127
Still flies, great on fuel.

10:06.170 --> 10:08.608
That's a mite better
than an old shoe.

10:08.651 --> 10:12.655
Due respects to the lady's feet.

10:12.699 --> 10:15.615
- This could go back and forth
all day, cut to the chase.

10:15.658 --> 10:18.705
What do you really
want...Bateman?

10:18.748 --> 10:21.055
- Bateman?

10:21.098 --> 10:23.535
- In the flesh.
And you're right.

10:23.579 --> 10:26.016
I dropped by for a reason.

10:26.060 --> 10:28.105
- Hey, can't you read?

10:28.149 --> 10:29.933
- I've never been
one for waiting.

10:41.075 --> 10:43.860
-My god.

10:43.904 --> 10:47.516
The stories were true.

10:47.559 --> 10:51.520
The holy grail of movie props.

10:51.563 --> 10:55.437
Actual human skeletons
as they appeared on screen.

10:55.480 --> 10:59.136
Your father was a hoarder of
beautiful things, but this?

10:59.180 --> 11:02.966
Keeping gems hidden from
the fans, it's criminal!

11:03.010 --> 11:07.188
This once's from--
ha, ha, "Raiders."

11:07.231 --> 11:09.103
Poor Marion.

11:09.146 --> 11:12.889
And--and--and "Poltergeist."

11:15.544 --> 11:19.896
Oh, and--and who
do we have here?

11:19.940 --> 11:24.248
Ah, yes! The original!

11:24.292 --> 11:29.471
It's great to see
you again, old friend.

11:29.514 --> 11:31.386
Wow.

11:32.866 --> 11:34.694
Beautiful!

11:36.608 --> 11:40.221
Oh, and--

11:40.264 --> 11:42.484
And just the little lady
I was hoping to see.

11:43.790 --> 11:47.750
Last but not least, the basement
zombie from "Dawn of the Dead."

11:47.794 --> 11:49.360
The Romero classic, of course.

11:49.404 --> 11:51.972
- Is there any other?
- Fast zombies suck.

11:52.015 --> 11:56.063
I admit. I'm impressed.

11:56.106 --> 11:59.806
- No, you're not.
I'm gotta ask you again.

11:59.849 --> 12:00.937
What do you really want?

12:00.981 --> 12:03.984
- I'm
not a greedy man.

12:09.119 --> 12:12.209
I'll settle for
this fellow over here.

12:12.253 --> 12:13.689
- Sorry, Bateman.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.866
My props are family,
and family's not for sale.

12:16.910 --> 12:18.607
- Did it sound like
I was negotiating?

12:22.393 --> 12:24.439
- What the hell is that?

12:24.482 --> 12:30.401
-Ancient relics
called newspaper clippings.

12:30.445 --> 12:31.794
This is an interesting
little tidbit from

12:31.838 --> 12:33.709
"The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette."

12:33.753 --> 12:35.624
It turns out our zombie
friend from "Dawn,"

12:35.667 --> 12:37.800
with the help of makeup
magician Tom Savini,

12:37.844 --> 12:41.804
was built over the skeleton of
an unknown human donor acquired

12:41.848 --> 12:44.024
from a medical supply house.
- Which was standard practice.

12:44.067 --> 12:45.503
A lot of movie
skeletons are real.

12:45.547 --> 12:47.288
- Fair enough.

12:47.331 --> 12:50.682
The skeleton was eventually
afforded a proper burial at, uh,

12:50.726 --> 12:54.599
Mount Lebanon Cemetery
in Pittsburgh.

12:54.643 --> 12:56.123
- Does this plot have a point?

12:56.166 --> 12:59.169
- More than a point. A twist.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.220
-The
remains were stolen.

13:09.179 --> 13:11.181
- Well, what are we
talking about, here?

13:11.225 --> 13:12.313
Ancient history?

13:12.356 --> 13:14.228
- Oh, no.

13:14.271 --> 13:16.883
That picture was
taken three days ago.

13:20.974 --> 13:23.759
Would you care to tell her?
Or should I?

13:28.982 --> 13:31.158
- Your boyfriend's
a grave robber.

13:31.201 --> 13:33.073
A certified ghoul.

13:33.116 --> 13:36.250
- You're full of shit!
Tell him!

13:36.293 --> 13:37.904
Tell him he's full of shit!

13:37.947 --> 13:42.125
- And you're a loyal
terrier, fierce and stupid.

13:42.169 --> 13:43.953
- Fuck you.

13:43.997 --> 13:46.173
- Who are you calling?
- Well, the cops, of course.

13:46.216 --> 13:47.478
- No, you can't.

13:47.522 --> 13:49.089
They'll close us
down before we open.

13:49.132 --> 13:50.568
- And worse
when they hear about

13:50.612 --> 13:52.266
your ghoulish little
undertakings.

13:52.309 --> 13:53.571
- Please,
you don't understand!

13:53.615 --> 13:56.531
These props are
my father's legacy.

13:56.574 --> 14:00.013
- Get up. Get up!

14:00.056 --> 14:02.102
I'm not interested in
his pathetic legacy.

14:02.145 --> 14:04.104
I'm only interested
in our friend here!

14:04.147 --> 14:06.758
And I'll take it to go.
Wrap it up.

14:06.802 --> 14:08.891
And, you know, you can throw in
the little Rosa Klebb shoe too

14:08.935 --> 14:10.371
as an extra bonus.

14:10.414 --> 14:12.373
I could always use a
little cheese spreader.

14:12.416 --> 14:14.201
- Eat shit!

14:14.244 --> 14:15.593
- Danielle,

14:15.637 --> 14:17.682
give him the shoe.
- No!

14:17.726 --> 14:18.858
- Give it.

14:49.236 --> 14:52.021
- He's dead, Jim.

14:52.065 --> 14:54.241
- You forgot to
say spoiler alert.

14:57.592 --> 15:00.421
Oh, Jesus!
This isn't a dream.

15:00.464 --> 15:01.683
This is really happening!

15:01.726 --> 15:02.771
- Quiet, I--I'm thinking.

15:02.814 --> 15:04.512
- Yeah, you think.

15:04.555 --> 15:05.861
Keep thinking
while I figure out

15:05.905 --> 15:08.211
what I'm gonna wear
to fucking jail!

15:08.255 --> 15:09.517
- No, it's not gonna happen.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.693
Not to my Mona Lisa, okay?

15:13.825 --> 15:15.653
All right, take a breath.

15:18.743 --> 15:22.617
All right, new plot twist.

15:22.660 --> 15:24.662
Grab me the "Night of
the Living Dead" meat hooks

15:24.706 --> 15:26.360
and the box cutter
from "Breaking Bad"

15:26.403 --> 15:28.579
and meet me in the back. Go.

15:43.290 --> 15:44.944
- You work for us now, Bateman.

15:48.077 --> 15:50.514
Me and Pop.

15:50.558 --> 15:51.820
Faster, pussycat, move!

15:51.863 --> 15:53.909
Our doors open in
less than six hours.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.084
-Ugh, I'm moving!

15:55.128 --> 15:56.607
This prick's heavier
than he looks!

15:56.651 --> 15:58.740
-I hear ya.

15:58.783 --> 16:00.785
-Jesus, what the
hell did he have for lunch?

16:00.829 --> 16:02.483
-I think we're
about to find out.

16:02.526 --> 16:04.659
-Oh god, no. Eww!

16:10.621 --> 16:12.232
-Yup!

16:12.275 --> 16:16.584
In you go!

16:16.627 --> 16:18.064
-Hasta
la vista, baby.

16:19.413 --> 16:21.328
I'm melting! I'm melting!

16:21.371 --> 16:23.156
Aaah...geez, I'm sorry.

16:23.199 --> 16:24.809
I couldn't resist.

16:41.565 --> 16:44.481
Baby? You okay?

16:51.358 --> 16:55.057
- We all go a little
mad sometimes.

16:55.101 --> 16:56.928
That thing he said
about the cemetery--

16:56.972 --> 17:00.062
- Mount Lebanon?
- Yeah, whatever.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.891
That was bullshit, right?

17:02.934 --> 17:04.893
I mean, you wouldn't actually
dig up a person's grave.

17:04.936 --> 17:06.155
- Of course not.

17:06.199 --> 17:08.549
Of course, what
do you take me for?

17:08.592 --> 17:09.854
Burke did the actual digging.

17:09.898 --> 17:11.465
Cost me a goddamn
fortune in overtime.

17:11.508 --> 17:15.295
- Burke?
Oh, Jesus, you sick fucks!

17:16.774 --> 17:19.212
- Let's not make a
thing out of it, okay?

17:19.255 --> 17:21.127
I mean, I hate to bring it up
because you're upset and all,

17:21.170 --> 17:22.911
but why exactly
are we going to cut up

17:22.954 --> 17:26.567
a bloodstained carpet? Huh?

17:26.610 --> 17:29.918
Is somebody we know the pot
calling the kettle black?

17:29.961 --> 17:32.573
- No, don't touch me.
Don't even fucking look at me.

17:32.616 --> 17:36.577
- Sweetheart, it
wasn't doing anybody any good

17:36.620 --> 17:39.275
six feet under the ground.

17:39.319 --> 17:41.321
It happens to be
my favorite movie.

17:41.364 --> 17:43.105
All I did was restore it.

17:43.149 --> 17:45.281
And don't think I didn't consult
Savini about the specifics.

17:45.325 --> 17:47.762
It is his baby.
He gave me detailed instructions

17:47.805 --> 17:49.894
on how to remove a few
of the Rice Krispies and--

17:49.938 --> 17:51.113
you don't
really wanna hear this.

17:51.157 --> 17:52.680
- No, I really fucking don't!

17:53.855 --> 17:55.291
Well, what about
this newbie, huh?

17:55.335 --> 17:56.727
Where's he from?

17:58.729 --> 18:00.166
Baby!
- He's not from anything.

18:00.209 --> 18:02.124
He's...

18:02.168 --> 18:04.518
my pop.

18:04.561 --> 18:06.302
- Jesus, you dug him up too?

18:06.346 --> 18:08.130
- It's not how you think.
It's what Pop wanted.

18:08.174 --> 18:09.871
He laid it all out in his will.

18:09.914 --> 18:11.394
- What, to become
a fucking prop?

18:11.438 --> 18:15.268
- Of course not!
Well, yeah, yeah, actually.

18:15.311 --> 18:18.314
He donated his remains
to science...fiction.

18:21.622 --> 18:24.712
- Jesus, I--I--I killed
someone because of you!

18:24.755 --> 18:26.409
- And don't think
I'll ever forget it.

18:26.453 --> 18:28.194
- No, don't--
- Where are you going?

18:28.237 --> 18:30.152
- To take a fucking shower
and try to figure out

18:30.196 --> 18:32.807
the rest of my fucking life!

18:32.850 --> 18:35.462
- Hey, very good. You do that.

18:35.505 --> 18:38.117
I'll finish up down here.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.988
Deep six the carpet.

18:40.031 --> 18:41.468
Get rid of all of
his personal stuff.

18:41.511 --> 18:44.862
Oh, and move his car.
I have to move his car.

18:44.906 --> 18:47.169
You know, last-minute details?

18:47.213 --> 18:48.605
It's all about the details.

18:59.660 --> 19:02.053
Ugh, what a day.

19:13.804 --> 19:15.154
- Hello?

19:16.546 --> 19:17.852
-Anyone around?

19:19.897 --> 19:21.943
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

19:25.033 --> 19:26.687
Fuck-a-diddle!

19:50.101 --> 19:51.494
- What the hell?

22:33.352 --> 22:36.442
-Danielle!
Danielle! Danielle!

22:39.488 --> 22:41.664
Oh, fuck! I'm sorry.

22:46.539 --> 22:48.062
- Aah!

22:55.678 --> 22:59.552
- BATEMAN'

23:08.778 --> 23:10.084
- Help, help!

23:36.502 --> 23:41.376
- Oh! Huh!

24:20.023 --> 24:22.156
- Pop?
- Huh?

24:41.697 --> 24:44.613
- We did it, Pop. We won.

25:04.198 --> 25:07.680
- Shit.

25:07.723 --> 25:10.857
-Ugh, total shit.

25:10.900 --> 25:13.903
- That one's all right.
-Huh, not bad.

25:13.947 --> 25:15.557
- This one's kind
of awesome, yo.

25:15.601 --> 25:17.733
- Huh.

25:17.777 --> 25:19.474
- I'm glad you dig it, yo.

25:19.518 --> 25:23.173
She's my masterpiece.
My Mona Lisa.

25:26.394 --> 25:28.657
- Oh, and spoiler alert?

25:28.701 --> 25:32.835
Props are magic
and they never die.

26:18.664 --> 26:21.580
-- One more song!
-- Come on, let's go.

26:23.190 --> 26:25.888
Look at you. You okay?

26:25.932 --> 26:27.847
- You can drink!

26:27.890 --> 26:31.111
- Yeah! Look, I'm
almost officially a lawyer.

26:31.154 --> 26:32.678
If I don't start
getting "bwasted" now,

26:32.721 --> 26:35.376
then I'll fall years
behind, and that's no good.

26:35.419 --> 26:36.899
- Did you
just say "bwasted"?

26:36.943 --> 26:38.509
- No. No, no, no.

26:38.553 --> 26:41.251
- You're wasted.
- Just a "widdle."

26:41.295 --> 26:43.427
- Okay, we seriously
have to stop doing that.

26:43.471 --> 26:45.386
- It's not me. It's you.

26:45.429 --> 26:47.649
It's not my fault your
hearing's shot to shit.

26:47.693 --> 26:51.305
- Oh, wow, that's your
entire defense, Counselor?

26:51.348 --> 26:54.438
The witness can't hear?

26:54.482 --> 26:56.702
- Yeah, that works
for me, mm-hmm.

26:56.745 --> 26:59.008
- You need to save
your brain cells for court.

26:59.052 --> 27:00.662
- Why? There's zero proof

27:00.706 --> 27:02.621
that drinking
actually kills brain cells.

27:02.664 --> 27:06.059
- Oh, no, you know what?
I believe you.

27:06.102 --> 27:08.627
There are millions that
wouldn't, but you got me.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.280
- Ooh, well, as
long as I got you,

27:10.324 --> 27:12.021
that's all that matters.

27:12.065 --> 27:15.111
- Oh my god, we have
to go in there, like, right now.

27:15.155 --> 27:19.289
- Where?
- There.

27:19.333 --> 27:21.465
- Are they even open right now?
It's very--

27:21.509 --> 27:22.684
- Yeah, come on! It'll be fun.

27:22.728 --> 27:25.948
Boone's Third Eye.

27:25.992 --> 27:28.603
How have I not seen
this place before?

27:28.647 --> 27:30.518
After you!

27:44.227 --> 27:48.928
-This is gonna be great!

27:53.280 --> 27:56.718
Hello? Hello?

28:00.461 --> 28:02.289
I see dead people.

28:02.332 --> 28:04.291
I see lawsuits.

28:04.334 --> 28:05.988
-Ooh!

28:06.032 --> 28:08.599
- Don't--don't--don't touch.
Don't touch anything.

28:11.864 --> 28:13.256
Anyone home?

28:15.171 --> 28:19.132
Ooh, scary curtain.

28:19.175 --> 28:22.004
- Boone?
- One would hope.

28:28.794 --> 28:31.927
-Welcome.
Please, come in.

28:35.409 --> 28:40.675
I'm nearsighted, so you're
going to have to come...

28:40.719 --> 28:42.721
closer.

28:42.764 --> 28:45.375
-Sit. Sit.

28:55.908 --> 28:58.867
- You, give me your left palm.

28:58.911 --> 29:00.913
Left.

29:05.700 --> 29:07.049
- I smell spirits.

29:07.093 --> 29:10.009
- Well, I'm sure you do.
- We've been--

29:12.272 --> 29:14.578
-Your palm
is fascinating.

29:14.622 --> 29:17.886
And it's so soft.

29:17.930 --> 29:21.237
So detailed.

29:21.281 --> 29:22.761
- Does that mean I
have a lot of wrinkles?

29:22.804 --> 29:24.023
Do I have
a lot of wrinkles?

29:24.066 --> 29:27.200
- So many, babe.

29:27.243 --> 29:30.943
-Wrinkles
are our lifelines.

29:30.986 --> 29:33.423
They keep us tethered as we age.

29:33.467 --> 29:37.471
Only those who die without
living can avoid them.

29:37.514 --> 29:39.778
- That's a very nice
way of putting it.

29:39.821 --> 29:41.257
- Hm.

29:44.521 --> 29:46.523
You're an artist.

29:46.567 --> 29:48.177
- How did you know that?

29:48.221 --> 29:51.615
- In your art, you use your
hands, but you do not paint.

29:51.659 --> 29:55.532
- Right! Right, I sculpt!
This is unreal.

29:55.576 --> 29:59.319
- You're working on a very
big project right now.

29:59.362 --> 30:05.064
In fact...you feel guilty
for having partied tonight

30:05.107 --> 30:09.155
instead of working.
-Yes.

30:09.198 --> 30:11.548
- And this project, it's very
important to you, isn't it?

30:13.246 --> 30:15.726
I can see in your hands

30:15.770 --> 30:18.294
that you're very creative
and respected.

30:18.338 --> 30:19.687
-Yeah!

30:19.730 --> 30:22.342
- And so you have a
gallery show coming up.

30:24.474 --> 30:26.781
- A lot of important
people will be attending.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.130
-This is unreal! Okay.

30:28.174 --> 30:32.700
- Someone named Marcia.
Someone named Doug.

30:32.743 --> 30:34.223
They will be taking...

30:44.538 --> 30:47.758
- Jackson!
Jackson, did you hear that?

30:47.802 --> 30:51.850
I mean, this is bonkers!
Like, mind-bending stuff.

30:51.893 --> 30:54.026
She knows all about Marcia,
and Doug, and the show, and--

30:56.202 --> 30:58.595
Honey, are you okay?

30:58.639 --> 31:01.947
- Um, yeah, I--I think

31:01.990 --> 31:04.558
I just had a little bit
too much to drink.

31:04.601 --> 31:06.690
Maybe we should go
home, if that's okay?

31:06.734 --> 31:09.911
-Yeah, of course.

31:09.955 --> 31:12.522
- Yeah, let's--let's go--

31:17.571 --> 31:20.052
- I...

31:20.095 --> 31:23.446
accept...

31:23.490 --> 31:25.709
most major credit cards.

31:25.753 --> 31:27.929
- Of course you do.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.672
Did you have fun tonight?
- Yeah.

31:31.715 --> 31:34.936
Yeah, I--I think maybe
Boone was hitting on me?

31:34.980 --> 31:39.245
- Oh, I mean, I couldn't tell. I
was kind of dwunk.

31:39.288 --> 31:40.899
- Please
god, make him stop.

31:40.942 --> 31:42.161
- Make me?

31:48.036 --> 31:49.908
- You smell really nice.

31:54.521 --> 31:57.437
- What do you think the
future of tonight looks like?

32:04.792 --> 32:06.489
- Oh!

32:06.533 --> 32:10.450
Oh, Rudolph is too old to be
really scary, but he tries.

32:10.493 --> 32:11.973
- Grouchy old bastard.

32:12.017 --> 32:13.540
Like, any time you show
me a little attention,

32:13.583 --> 32:17.631
any time you say
my name, he just...

32:17.674 --> 32:18.806
No, don't.

32:18.849 --> 32:19.981
Don't, just stop.

32:20.025 --> 32:21.113
Aah!

32:23.028 --> 32:25.291
- Okay, okay, okay, okay!
Both of you stop.

32:25.334 --> 32:26.727
Both of you stop!

32:28.076 --> 32:29.904
- God, let's watch
some TV or something.

32:31.297 --> 32:32.863
-What do you think
got that boy so scared?

32:32.907 --> 32:33.777
-I don't know.

32:35.344 --> 32:36.824
But I can tell you,

32:36.867 --> 32:38.565
I haven't seen a look
like that since George Kelso.

32:38.608 --> 32:41.872
-- George who?
-- George Kelso.

32:41.916 --> 32:44.701
Years ago, he saw something
in the sewers that spooked

32:44.745 --> 32:46.007
the bejesus out of him.

32:49.489 --> 32:50.707
-Shit!

32:50.751 --> 32:52.318
- MRS.
Must've made landfall.

32:52.361 --> 32:55.016
-I remember something
that my daddy used to say to me.

32:55.060 --> 32:57.801
He'd say, "Son,
there are things..."

33:05.592 --> 33:09.422
- What happened?
Did the movie end?

33:09.465 --> 33:11.032
- I've got to stop
drinking for a while.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.296
I'm starting to act more
like the client

33:14.340 --> 33:15.732
instead of the lawyer.

33:20.041 --> 33:21.695
-It's not right.

33:21.738 --> 33:24.045
You simply cannot walk right in,
take what you want, and leave.

33:24.089 --> 33:25.438
- They most certainly
cannot do that.

33:25.481 --> 33:27.962
- So it's a failsafe
case, a slam dunk.

33:28.006 --> 33:30.225
- Well...
- Well what?

33:30.269 --> 33:32.749
- You gotta remember the law is
always up for interpretation.

33:32.793 --> 33:35.622
- Interpretation?
This is a slam dunk!

33:35.665 --> 33:37.319
- Yes, I believe so.

33:37.363 --> 33:40.322
But we must approach the rim
as if it is 11 feet high

33:40.366 --> 33:42.020
just in case.

33:42.063 --> 33:44.892
- You better believe
I've got a good case.

33:44.935 --> 33:46.372
- I do.

33:49.114 --> 33:50.158
-I can't believe it!

33:58.732 --> 34:01.082
- Who faxes anymore?

34:17.229 --> 34:19.622
-O...kay.

34:23.757 --> 34:24.845
That's weird.

35:01.882 --> 35:05.494
-It's ridiculous.
Hiding in the bathroom.

35:05.538 --> 35:07.105
What?

35:07.148 --> 35:09.585
-No, why would
I joke about this?

35:09.629 --> 35:12.371
No, not again.
Please not again.

35:15.678 --> 35:18.159
-Hello?

35:43.358 --> 35:44.925
- Let me see it.

35:44.968 --> 35:48.015
- Okay.

35:51.323 --> 35:53.281
- This is...scary.

35:53.325 --> 35:55.065
- Yeah, no shit, babe.

35:55.109 --> 35:56.589
- Do you believe it?

35:56.632 --> 35:58.460
- I don't know, okay?

35:58.504 --> 36:00.593
Something's going on, though.

36:00.636 --> 36:02.551
Something happened at the office
today and all of this started

36:02.595 --> 36:05.337
after we left that man's place.

36:05.380 --> 36:09.254
- Do you think...

36:09.297 --> 36:11.212
Do you think something
followed you here?

36:11.256 --> 36:16.913
- I'm not saying that, exactly.
I don't know what I'm saying.

36:16.957 --> 36:18.393
- Well, maybe this is exciting.

36:18.437 --> 36:21.440
- What? No, stop it!
- No, I mean it!

36:21.483 --> 36:24.704
Imagine if this is true.
The supernatural.

36:24.747 --> 36:28.403
If there's something really
following you, that's evidence.

36:28.447 --> 36:31.319
- Babe, you don't understand.
This thing is terrifying.

36:31.363 --> 36:33.452
- We should go see him again.
- Who?

36:33.495 --> 36:35.193
- Boone!
- Not a chance.

36:35.236 --> 36:37.107
- Well, if he knew something
was there in the first place,

36:37.151 --> 36:38.587
he might know how
to get rid of it.

36:38.631 --> 36:40.067
- Fawn, absolutely not, okay?

36:40.110 --> 36:43.375
That place gave me the
creeps, possibly worse.

36:43.418 --> 36:44.985
- Okay.

36:57.519 --> 36:59.739
- Why? Why?
- Oh, come on, come on!

36:59.782 --> 37:01.349
I'm kidding.
- Yeah.

37:01.393 --> 37:03.438
- I--I--I believe you,
okay?

37:03.482 --> 37:05.353
- You're never gonna let
me live this down, are you?

37:05.397 --> 37:10.315
- Nope. But the good news is,
you'll never be alone again.

37:10.358 --> 37:12.795
- Okay.

37:12.839 --> 37:14.667
- You're a comedian.
- I made something for you.

37:16.712 --> 37:18.714
To keep you even more company.

37:18.758 --> 37:20.716
- Oh, nice.

37:23.937 --> 37:26.026
What are you saying?
I'm a lamb?

37:26.069 --> 37:29.595
- I...plead the
fifth, Counselor.

37:29.638 --> 37:31.814
- I love it.

37:31.858 --> 37:33.512
- I love you.

37:38.691 --> 37:40.170
And I'm waiting...

37:40.214 --> 37:41.563
- I love you too.

37:57.144 --> 37:58.798
-Working
late at the studio tonight.

37:58.841 --> 38:01.279
I guess you have to bond
with your imaginary friend.

38:01.322 --> 38:03.542
See you later, bye!

38:12.768 --> 38:14.814
- Hello?

38:14.857 --> 38:16.816
Boone!

38:58.901 --> 39:01.077
-"Familiars will do
absolutely anything to remain

39:01.121 --> 39:03.515
"attached to their human host.

39:03.558 --> 39:08.868
"They will sneak, cheat,
and even kill to remain close.

39:08.911 --> 39:11.958
"Some inhabit the bodies
of those they kill,

39:12.001 --> 39:15.875
pretending to be a
host's longtime friend."

39:15.918 --> 39:17.224
Longtime friend...

39:17.267 --> 39:19.052
-You have trap it!

39:21.620 --> 39:24.144
Your familiar,
you need to keep it

39:24.187 --> 39:27.103
as far away from you as
possible.

39:27.147 --> 39:30.324
I can tell you how.

39:30.368 --> 39:32.282
But not without a drink first.

39:37.679 --> 39:40.116
Exorcisms are all bullshit.

39:40.160 --> 39:43.206
It's a good show.
Gets butts in the seats.

39:43.250 --> 39:45.600
But what you need to
do is catch yours.

39:45.644 --> 39:47.385
- Catch who?

39:47.428 --> 39:48.647
- You'll need some
innocence bait.

39:51.345 --> 39:52.346
- What's that?

39:52.390 --> 39:56.350
- This was made from pure joy.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.047
My sister made this for me.

39:58.091 --> 40:00.572
Not a speck of negative
dust in the room.

40:00.615 --> 40:03.879
When you leave here,
go directly home.

40:03.923 --> 40:06.099
And when you arrive,

40:06.142 --> 40:07.840
I want you to draw a
sacred circle on the floor.

40:07.883 --> 40:09.450
- Sacred circle? What's that?
- Google it.

40:09.494 --> 40:11.365
After the circle's complete,

40:11.409 --> 40:16.022
you place the innocence bait
in the trap.

40:16.065 --> 40:20.548
Now, this trap requires
a blessed crate...

40:20.592 --> 40:22.637
which I happen to have
available in the showroom

40:22.681 --> 40:24.247
for a nominal fee.

40:24.291 --> 40:27.076
- All major credit cards
accepted, I get it, come on.

40:27.120 --> 40:31.037
- The blessed crate should
be suspended above the trap.

40:31.080 --> 40:35.694
So, when something steps
inside of the trap, boom!

40:37.522 --> 40:40.960
Once it's caught, you take it
to deepest lake you can find

40:41.003 --> 40:42.788
and you drown it.

40:42.831 --> 40:46.922
You let it sink where not even
the scent of you can reach it!

40:46.966 --> 40:48.184
- I knew this whole
thing was crazy.

40:48.228 --> 40:49.795
I shouldn't have even come here.

40:49.838 --> 40:51.753
Okay, look, if you think for one
second I'm gonna take some crate

40:51.797 --> 40:55.714
and lug it into my
apartment, you are crazy!

41:36.363 --> 41:39.540
- Here we go.

42:08.221 --> 42:10.353
- Rudolph! Rudolph!
Wait, wait, wait.

42:10.397 --> 42:13.356
Buddy, wait, wait, wait.
Come on. Come on.

42:32.593 --> 42:34.464
-Wait.
The innocence bait is gone.

42:45.519 --> 42:48.522
- Jesus.

42:48.566 --> 42:52.047
Hi, honey!
This is a nice surprise.

42:52.091 --> 42:56.835
- Yeah, I thought I'd come
see where the magic happens.

42:56.878 --> 42:58.880
You know, check your vibes.

42:58.924 --> 43:01.927
- Oh, so you're into vibes now?
I love it.

43:01.970 --> 43:03.972
I was afraid you
were here to return the lamb.

43:04.016 --> 43:07.019
- No. Why would I do that?
- Check this out.

43:07.062 --> 43:10.892
I've been working on this
for the past two weeks.

43:10.936 --> 43:12.633
-My sister
made this for me.

43:12.677 --> 43:14.635
Not a speck of negative
dust in the room.

43:18.334 --> 43:21.468
- What's going on?

43:21.511 --> 43:25.080
- Um...so, remember--

43:27.430 --> 43:29.607
- Oh, shit!
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.

43:29.650 --> 43:32.218
I have to be at the
gallery right now.

43:32.261 --> 43:35.917
Aw, the first time you surprise
me in forever and I've gotta go.

43:35.961 --> 43:38.093
Hey, you wanna tag along?
There'll be wine.

43:38.137 --> 43:41.923
- Later. Go, have fun.

43:41.967 --> 43:43.664
I got something to
handle too, so...

43:43.708 --> 43:45.013
- Okay.

43:51.716 --> 43:52.978
-Oh, would
you lock up for me?

43:53.021 --> 43:54.936
- Okay.

44:45.117 --> 44:47.336
- Is that Mommy?
Is that Mommy?

44:56.476 --> 44:58.391
-Jackson?

44:58.434 --> 45:00.001
Jackson, what's going on?

45:01.786 --> 45:03.744
What am I doing in here?

45:03.788 --> 45:05.877
Hello?

45:05.920 --> 45:07.182
Jackson, help me.

45:14.407 --> 45:16.626
-Hello?

45:24.069 --> 45:25.244
-Sorry, the caller

45:25.287 --> 45:26.767
you're trying to reach is
unavailable.

45:26.811 --> 45:29.727
-Jackson,
what's going on?

45:29.770 --> 45:31.511
- Son of a bitch.
-Jackson, please help.

45:31.554 --> 45:35.080
- Can't fool me. I got you.

45:38.648 --> 45:41.216
I got you!

45:41.260 --> 45:45.046
Come on, pick up, pick up.
Come on, pick up!

45:45.090 --> 45:46.744
-- Hello?
-- Boone, I trapped it.

45:46.787 --> 45:48.354
It's in the crate.

45:48.397 --> 45:49.572
-You what?
- The familiar!

45:49.616 --> 45:53.054
I trapped it!
It's in the crate.

45:53.098 --> 45:56.579
-You know what to do.
- Yeah, yeah, I do.

45:56.623 --> 46:01.062
-So not even the
scent of you reaches it.

46:01.106 --> 46:02.585
- I know.

46:02.629 --> 46:04.500
-Good luck.

46:10.985 --> 46:14.467
Jackson! Jackson!

46:29.874 --> 46:31.484
-Jackson!

46:31.527 --> 46:34.617
Jackson, please
get me out of here!

46:48.327 --> 46:49.763
-Jackson!

46:52.722 --> 46:55.682
Aah! Aah!

47:07.346 --> 47:09.000
- Whew.

47:09.043 --> 47:11.219
I'm free.

47:19.880 --> 47:21.403
- Fawn!

47:29.237 --> 47:30.804
- F-Fawn?

47:47.386 --> 47:49.301
- Fawn?

47:52.608 --> 47:54.088
- No.

47:58.571 --> 48:00.399
- Fawn?

48:14.152 --> 48:16.894
-No, it can't be.
Fawn.

48:21.986 --> 48:24.945
- I believe you now.

48:24.989 --> 48:26.860
I believe you.
