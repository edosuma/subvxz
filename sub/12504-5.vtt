00:06.274 --> 00:08.042
[Kaylie] Previously on
Make It Or Break It:

00:08.076 --> 00:09.477
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.080
Well, I have a secret.
I'm not a virgin anymore.

00:12.113 --> 00:14.282
It's OK. They know about us.

00:16.084 --> 00:18.552
- Thanks for not telling Kaylie.
- I didn't do it for you.
I did it for her.

00:18.586 --> 00:21.089
- You wouldn't be interested
in managing the team?
- What?

00:21.122 --> 00:23.591
I need someone who cares
about the children,
not the politics.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.459
I'm filling in
for my buddy, Razor.

00:25.493 --> 00:28.196
You know, I don't think
she's ever even been kissed.

00:28.229 --> 00:31.199
Mom? You worked
all day for me.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.301
- You don't like me.
- I don't know you.

00:33.334 --> 00:34.568
Ouch.

00:34.602 --> 00:36.504
[uptempo music]

00:38.239 --> 00:40.208
* Oh oh-oh-oh

00:40.241 --> 00:43.411
* Everybody let's go!

00:43.444 --> 00:46.147
* Clap your hands now

00:46.180 --> 00:47.548
* Everybody now

00:47.581 --> 00:50.251
* Hey! Hey! Hey!
Come on! *

00:50.284 --> 00:53.387
My first mother's meeting.
I can't wait to pitch
right on in there

00:53.421 --> 00:55.323
and get to know
the other ladies better.

00:55.356 --> 00:56.924
OK, Mom, remember
what we talked about.

00:56.957 --> 01:01.229
The Rock is not a social club.
And not everybody needs
to know all of our business.

01:01.262 --> 01:07.101
OK, listen to me. I am sorry
I told Mr. Hot Boy at the
Pizza Shack you were a gymnast.

01:07.135 --> 01:09.437
I don't see why it matters.
He was very impressed.

01:09.470 --> 01:12.273
It matters because
I have a lot going on
right now.

01:12.306 --> 01:13.641
Juggling a lot
of different things,

01:13.674 --> 01:15.509
it's just easier for me
to keep the...

01:15.543 --> 01:17.478
...different parts
of my life separate.

01:17.511 --> 01:20.248
You know, organized.
Separately.

01:20.281 --> 01:22.550
Honey, you were
always so organized.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.218
Even as a baby
in your high chair,

01:24.252 --> 01:26.220
you had your little
pile of crackers,

01:26.254 --> 01:28.622
your little pile of peas,
your pile of cheese puffs...

01:28.656 --> 01:32.160
- Wait. You fed me
cheese puffs as a baby?
- They're food, Emily.

01:32.193 --> 01:36.130
Look, I just don't like
to mix it all up. You can
understand that, right?

01:36.164 --> 01:37.431
Absolutely.

01:37.465 --> 01:40.301
Emily! Get to work!

01:40.334 --> 01:42.170
[sighs]

01:42.203 --> 01:44.172
That's the new coach?

01:44.205 --> 01:48.409
He is one hot crumpet.
Ooh.

01:50.211 --> 01:52.880
- I still can't believe
you had sex!
- It's so not that big a deal.

01:52.913 --> 01:57.551
Uh, it's a huge deal.
And I can't believe you
won't tell me anything either.

01:57.585 --> 01:59.520
Did it hurt?

01:59.553 --> 02:03.424
I've hyper-extended both elbows,
I think I can survive
losing my virginity.

02:03.457 --> 02:08.329
Tell me the truth.
On a scale of one to ten.

02:08.362 --> 02:09.463
How awful was it?

02:09.497 --> 02:10.898
OK, OK, OK, OK!

02:10.931 --> 02:13.334
And what was he like?

02:13.367 --> 02:16.570
I mean, you're never
gonna forget the first guy
you did it with. No way.

02:16.604 --> 02:20.474
Truth?
I couldn't be happier.

02:20.508 --> 02:23.311
- Even though
he never called you?
- I didn't want him to call me.

02:23.344 --> 02:26.280
This wasn't about a guy,
it was about me.

02:26.314 --> 02:28.316
Losing my virginity
was the final hurdle.

02:28.349 --> 02:31.352
It's like it was holding me back
and I didn't even know it.

02:31.385 --> 02:32.620
Holding you back how?

02:32.653 --> 02:35.456
In every way. Watch.

02:35.489 --> 02:38.192
- * Let's go!
- * We're taking over
the floor *

02:38.226 --> 02:40.394
- * Let's go, let's go!
- * Like never before

02:40.428 --> 02:43.297
* We're gonna go 'til we
Just can't go no more *

02:43.331 --> 02:46.367
- * Let's go!
- * Breaking down the door

02:46.400 --> 02:48.702
You've got
a front tuck mount now.

02:48.736 --> 02:50.604
Yep.

02:50.638 --> 02:55.276
Carter's never pressured me
to do it, so...

02:55.309 --> 02:57.211
He just probably
doesn't see you that way.

02:57.245 --> 02:59.547
What does that mean?

02:59.580 --> 03:01.749
You're the type of girl
guys want to marry,

03:01.782 --> 03:04.985
not the kind
they want to have sex with.

03:05.018 --> 03:08.756
It's a good thing.
It's, uh, it's like
you're the girl next door.

03:08.789 --> 03:11.759
* Hey! Hey! One, two, three
Let's go **

03:11.792 --> 03:14.628
Three-nine-five,
three-nine-two-one.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.764
Hey, gym mama!
Is this seat taken?

03:16.797 --> 03:19.633
Oh! I can move my purse.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.536
No way!
We have the same bag!

03:23.771 --> 03:26.540
Mine's a fake. But you can't
even tell the difference.

03:26.574 --> 03:30.611
Uh-huh. I don't buy anything
without a serial number.

03:30.644 --> 03:34.548
OK, ladies,
thanks for coming.
I called this meeting

03:34.582 --> 03:38.652
because Rock is in the red.
If we're getting our girls
to Nationals...

03:38.686 --> 03:41.655
Wait. The girls need money
to go to Nationals?

03:41.689 --> 03:44.525
More than what we've got
in the couch cushions.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.560
[door opens, knocking]

03:46.594 --> 03:49.263
We, uh, late for Book Club?

03:49.297 --> 03:51.565
Very funny, Steve.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.634
I just heard there was
a meeting of The Rock mothers

03:53.667 --> 03:56.003
and, uh, since Lauren's mom
can't be here,

03:56.036 --> 03:59.540
I'd appreciate it
if Summer could,
you know, represent us.

03:59.573 --> 04:02.610
We'd love to have her.

04:02.643 --> 04:05.446
- Go away, honey.
- Right.

04:05.479 --> 04:09.583
Well, uh, I leave The Rock
in your... hands.

04:14.522 --> 04:16.557
He's awkward but not evil.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.526
- [all laugh]
- Come on in.

04:18.559 --> 04:22.630
So, my best guess is that
we have got to raise $10,000.

04:22.663 --> 04:26.334
- Holy bologna.
- We can start with
the old reliables:

04:26.367 --> 04:30.304
- Car wash is always
an option, bake sale...
- What about a fashion show?

04:30.338 --> 04:32.440
You know, we could
charge for tickets,

04:32.473 --> 04:34.575
get items donated from
a major department store,

04:34.608 --> 04:37.445
and then sell them
in a silent auction!
Hmm?

04:37.478 --> 04:39.380
That's a great idea.
That'd be perfect.

04:39.413 --> 04:41.815
I don't know. That sounds
like a big production.

04:41.849 --> 04:45.653
Well, do you want to get
the girls to Nationals or do you
want to have a quilting bee?

04:51.392 --> 04:52.426
Freeze.

04:53.861 --> 04:56.364
Do you understand the term
"full range of motion?"

04:56.397 --> 04:57.731
Yes. Of course.

04:57.765 --> 05:01.335
Full range
includes your face.

05:01.369 --> 05:03.604
You just completed
a perfect routine.

05:03.637 --> 05:06.507
So, why aren't you smiling?

05:09.610 --> 05:11.412
Drop it.

05:11.445 --> 05:13.681
This sport is about
more than perfection

05:13.714 --> 05:16.417
and athleticism, it's about
grace and beauty as well.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.886
And you are a beautiful
young woman.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.721
Let that shine through.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.656
You want to be great?

05:22.690 --> 05:25.693
Give me the beauty
with the brawn.

05:25.726 --> 05:29.463
It's just...
that's not my thing, OK?

05:29.497 --> 05:32.533
I'm about strength and power.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.868
If you're looking
for a girly-girl,
that's Kaylie.

05:44.878 --> 05:48.682
So, what have you and Lauren
been whispering about
all morning?

05:50.618 --> 05:54.388
All right, if I tell you,
you gotta swear
not to tell anyone.

05:54.422 --> 05:56.490
OK.

05:56.524 --> 06:00.528
Lauren lost her virginity
the other night at that party.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.663
[Kim] Let's just ask them.
They're gonna be doing it.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.933
Guys, I don't mean
to interrupt practice,

06:05.966 --> 06:07.635
and Sasha, my apologies...

06:07.668 --> 06:09.670
There's a lack of consensus
among the moms

06:09.703 --> 06:13.541
and we'd like to, uh
put it to the girls about
some fundraising ideas.

06:13.574 --> 06:16.877
Right. So we need to raise
money to get to Nationals.

06:16.910 --> 06:21.415
Some of the ideas on the ballot
are a car wash or a bake sale...

06:21.449 --> 06:22.916
Or a fashion show!

06:22.950 --> 06:26.954
- All in favor of fashion show
raise your hand!
- Oh! Yes!

06:26.987 --> 06:29.657
[girls cheering]

06:29.690 --> 06:31.659
Mother-daughter
fashion show it is!

06:31.692 --> 06:32.826
Mother-daughter?

06:32.860 --> 06:35.162
We only have five weeks
until Nationals.

06:35.195 --> 06:38.932
We don't need to be prancing
around like a bunch of silly
girls. We need to train.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.568
[Sasha] Hold on.

06:40.601 --> 06:44.872
Hair, makeup,
preening, vanity?

06:52.480 --> 06:53.947
I think it's
an excellent idea.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.987
[girls cheering]

07:20.841 --> 07:22.676
[rock music]

07:27.748 --> 07:31.018
Catwalk? Me-ow!

07:31.051 --> 07:33.921
Wait, they're going to just
give us clothes?

07:33.954 --> 07:36.023
This is the last thing
we need to be focusing on.

07:36.056 --> 07:38.659
I don't know why this thing
has to be mother-daughter.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.260
Is there any way
your mom could make it?

07:40.293 --> 07:43.230
My mother's in Darfur
doing relief work.

07:43.263 --> 07:44.898
Lo's mom knows
George Clooney.

07:44.932 --> 07:49.703
Sadly, she can't stop saving
kids so we can walk down
a runway in matching jumpers.

07:49.737 --> 07:52.540
Yeah, well, mine's busy
saving her glory days...

07:52.573 --> 07:54.608
...one spotlight at a time.

07:54.642 --> 07:57.745
- She was a pop star.
- And she still loves
center stage.

07:57.778 --> 08:03.016
Tell me about it. My mom refers
to her safety orange mini dress
as "the boring one".

08:03.050 --> 08:06.920
At least you guys have moms.
I mean, in town, you know.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.656
I guess I'll have to
sit this one out.

08:08.689 --> 08:11.692
Why don't you just
ask Summer to do it with you?

08:13.727 --> 08:16.930
I'd rather choke on a tube sock
than walk a runway with her.

08:16.964 --> 08:20.668
That's too bad.
It's gonna be fun.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.603
This is so stupid
and gross.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.772
Why is Sasha letting us
waste our time?

08:24.805 --> 08:27.908
Well, I can't wait to rock the
runway and blow Carter's mind.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.678
Wait till I glam up, ladies.

08:30.711 --> 08:33.080
This is my chance
to set him on fire!

08:36.717 --> 08:39.086
Maybe I should just
stay away from The Rock.

08:39.119 --> 08:43.557
Give it time, she'll come
around. Lauren could use
a female presence in her life,

08:43.591 --> 08:45.926
and I could
really use you here.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.961
Uh, look,
my mom's in Africa,

08:47.995 --> 08:51.832
so, uh, Summer, would you mind
doing the fashion show with me?

08:51.865 --> 08:54.735
Lauren, I would love to do
the fashion show with you.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.103
Great.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.673
I told you
she'd come around.

08:59.707 --> 09:01.809
Honey, I gotta
jet back to work.

09:01.842 --> 09:06.013
But, um, why didn't you tell me
the new coach is, like,
Simon Le Bon hot!

09:06.046 --> 09:10.050
- Mom.
- My bad.
Eighties band reference.

09:10.083 --> 09:12.653
That's why
I didn't tell you!

09:12.686 --> 09:13.854
The new coach
is off limits.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.989
I just said he was cute,
honey.

09:16.023 --> 09:19.927
Maybe just let The Rock
be my place, OK?

09:19.960 --> 09:21.629
I heard you before.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.964
I'll lay low
with zipped lips, I promise.

09:23.997 --> 09:26.066
From now on,
I won't embarrass you.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.802
- Emily!
- [Emily] Crap.

09:28.836 --> 09:30.771
- [sighs]
- Bye, sweetie!

09:35.676 --> 09:37.878
So you're sure
she was a virgin?

09:37.911 --> 09:40.614
She's my best friend.

09:40.648 --> 09:41.949
Is she OK?

09:41.982 --> 09:43.851
Well, you know Lauren,

09:43.884 --> 09:45.953
she's acting like
it's no big deal, but...

09:45.986 --> 09:48.722
...losing your virginity
to somebody who
doesn't love you?

09:48.756 --> 09:50.758
- It's pretty tragic.
- Yeah.

09:50.791 --> 09:54.094
And this guy sounds like
a real jerk. He hasn't
called her or anything.

09:54.127 --> 09:58.699
Luckily, when we do it
for the first time,

09:58.732 --> 10:02.636
you know, it'll be beautiful.
'Cause we love each other.

10:02.670 --> 10:04.404
- Right?
- Yeah.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.640
And hot.

10:06.674 --> 10:08.942
'Cause you do think
I'm hot, right?

10:08.976 --> 10:11.679
Way hot, bunny.

10:13.080 --> 10:16.917
We gotta get back to work.
Nationals are five weeks away.

10:23.791 --> 10:27.094
Fifty-two, fifty-three,
good...

10:27.127 --> 10:30.831
Coach Belov, can I talk to you?
I'd like to be excused
from the fashion show.

10:30.864 --> 10:33.934
- This is my last
Olympic cycle...
- Obliques.

10:35.102 --> 10:37.070
...and I need to dominate
in Nationals.

10:37.104 --> 10:39.172
You're an Olympian,
you get it.

10:39.206 --> 10:42.175
I need to be focused right now,
not prancing down a runway.

10:42.209 --> 10:44.712
Back to ones.

10:44.745 --> 10:47.848
So I'd like to
concentrate on training.

10:47.881 --> 10:51.719
You will participate in
the fashion show, consider
it part of your training.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.987
Part of my training?
I don't get it.

10:54.021 --> 10:56.790
I know.
Back to obliques.

10:58.859 --> 10:59.860
Good.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.168
Jeez!

11:09.737 --> 11:11.972
You scared me.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.007
What are you doing?

11:14.041 --> 11:16.243
Well, we haven't talked
since the other day.

11:16.276 --> 11:19.012
And I just thought since we have
to see each other in the gym...

11:19.046 --> 11:23.050
Look, I didn't know that
it was your first time
that night. I'm sorry.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.719
I was a jerk and I don't
want to be that guy.

11:25.753 --> 11:27.721
Kaylie told you.

11:27.755 --> 11:30.758
- Yeah.
- That must have
made you sweat.

11:30.791 --> 11:34.728
Talking to Kaylie about the
"mystery" guy I had sex with.

11:34.762 --> 11:36.830
I'm really sorry. If...
if I had known that...

11:36.864 --> 11:38.832
What? You would have
restrained yourself?

11:38.866 --> 11:41.735
You never asked,
by the way.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.971
I just thought that
it's... That you...

11:44.004 --> 11:48.275
- That I was a slut?
- No! I just thought...

11:48.308 --> 11:51.011
You seemed like
you had... experience.

11:51.044 --> 11:54.081
So, if I'd had experience,

11:54.114 --> 11:56.817
it would still be OK to have
meaningless sex with me?

11:56.850 --> 12:00.153
It's not like we have
feelings for each other.

12:00.187 --> 12:03.757
And you're a great girl.

12:03.791 --> 12:06.159
You're cute
and you're funny...

12:06.193 --> 12:10.197
And your first time should've
been with somebody that
you really liked, you know?

12:10.230 --> 12:12.900
Well, how do you know
I don't really like you?

12:12.933 --> 12:14.935
[sighs]

12:14.968 --> 12:17.805
I love Kaylie.
I'm with her.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.308
The little lady let you
get to second base yet?

12:21.341 --> 12:23.043
[exhales]

12:23.076 --> 12:25.813
We're waiting until
we're both ready.

12:25.846 --> 12:28.181
However long that is.

12:28.215 --> 12:31.018
Well, I just hope Kaylie
never finds out about us.

12:32.319 --> 12:33.787
In the meantime,

12:33.821 --> 12:35.889
if you want to be
friends with benefits,

12:35.923 --> 12:37.791
you know where to find me.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.231
[door opens]

12:46.266 --> 12:47.968
[door closes]

13:13.193 --> 13:15.896
You're a delightful
performer, Kaylie.

13:15.929 --> 13:18.231
But you're not a little girl,
you're an athlete.

13:18.265 --> 13:19.833
You need power.

13:19.867 --> 13:22.302
Third chakra.
Self-definition.

13:22.335 --> 13:23.837
Fire.

13:27.875 --> 13:31.244
That kind of fire.
Good job, Lauren.

13:31.278 --> 13:33.013
[Lauren] Thanks.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.120
You never sit still,
do you?

13:40.153 --> 13:42.622
I've gotta get
these invitations out
for the fashion show,

13:42.655 --> 13:44.624
which is giving
Payson an ulcer.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.394
I don't understand why
she's so freaked out.
She performs all the time.

13:47.427 --> 13:51.098
As an athlete, not as a girl.

13:51.131 --> 13:55.102
Payson... she isn't comfortable
with her femininity.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.404
She equates it with weakness.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.873
Wonder where she
gets that idea?

13:59.907 --> 14:03.977
It's been my experience that
girls get their cues about their
femininity from their mothers.

14:07.014 --> 14:11.418
From their strong, efficient,
Midwestern mothers,

14:11.451 --> 14:15.422
who, uh, don't fully embrace
how lovely they are as well.

14:15.455 --> 14:20.060
Well... you barely
brought that one
back around.

14:20.093 --> 14:22.162
Of course I could be wrong.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.331
It's been known to happen
on occasion.

14:25.465 --> 14:29.937
And I'm fine
about my femininity,
thank you very much!

14:37.677 --> 14:41.148
[Summer] I'm so happy
Lauren asked me to do
the fashion show with her.

14:41.181 --> 14:43.383
I think this
might be our chance
to bond a little.

14:43.416 --> 14:46.053
The only good thing about
a Rock fashion show

14:46.086 --> 14:50.023
is getting to see
my sexy girlfriend
walk the runway.

14:50.057 --> 14:53.060
Speaking of sex,
do you think Lauren
has a boyfriend?

14:53.093 --> 14:55.662
What? No.

14:55.695 --> 14:58.398
She's not interested in boys.
She's an elite gymnast.

14:58.431 --> 15:01.001
- That's her whole life.
- Well, she's also
a young woman.

15:01.034 --> 15:04.972
I'm telling you,
it's not an issue.

15:05.005 --> 15:07.440
Well, if not now,
it will be.

15:07.474 --> 15:09.943
When was the last time
Lauren talked to her mother?

15:09.977 --> 15:12.345
I'm not really sure,
it's been a while.

15:12.379 --> 15:14.982
She's... out of
the country a lot.

15:15.015 --> 15:18.318
You might want to have
"the talk" with Lauren.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.153
Me?

15:21.254 --> 15:23.423
Oh, jeez.

15:24.191 --> 15:26.226
OK.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.096
Do you think maybe
you could talk to her?

15:38.138 --> 15:40.940
- Here you go. Thanks.
- Great. No problem.

15:42.509 --> 15:46.213
Who you waiting for?
Your fancy Rock posse
coming in tonight?

15:46.246 --> 15:47.480
- I don't have a posse.
- Really?

15:47.514 --> 15:50.383
What about the guy who picked
you up from the party in the car

15:50.417 --> 15:53.420
that cost more than a condo?

15:53.453 --> 15:57.257
Well, I think he's back
at the family compound.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.525
I wonder where he summers?

16:00.760 --> 16:04.031
You're quite an artist
with the peppers, aren't you?

16:04.064 --> 16:06.266
Deep dish is my medium.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.535
No, it's not.
You are a songwriter.

16:08.568 --> 16:11.738
You think I didn't
see you making notes
on the take-out menu?

16:11.771 --> 16:13.740
I'm not looking
to date a Rock girl.

16:13.773 --> 16:17.510
- I wasn't asking you on a date.
- Weren't you?

16:17.544 --> 16:20.180
I think all that hair product
is rotting your brain.

16:20.213 --> 16:22.049
No, that's just
my cynicism.

16:22.082 --> 16:23.550
And I'm not your
standard Rock girl.

16:23.583 --> 16:26.419
Oh, of course not. And you
wouldn't be embarrassed

16:26.453 --> 16:28.988
if those girls knew you
worked at the Pizza Shack?

16:30.590 --> 16:33.793
Not as embarrassed as a guy
who's so scared to sing
the songs he writes,

16:33.826 --> 16:35.428
he hands them off
to his best friend.

16:35.462 --> 16:39.566
Ahh, of course, of course.
You were thinking of Razor.

16:39.599 --> 16:42.235
Nice guy.

16:42.269 --> 16:44.271
- You're nothing like him.
- You're right.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.539
I'm nothing like Razor.

16:47.540 --> 16:48.541
Would Razor do this?

16:54.214 --> 16:56.483
- What the hell
made you do that?
- That?

16:56.516 --> 17:00.453
Oh, your mom said you'd
never been kissed before.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.593
Mom!

17:06.626 --> 17:11.164
- What?!
- You told Damon Young
I've never been kissed?

17:11.198 --> 17:13.400
It's like my dignity
is totally disposable to you.

17:20.273 --> 17:22.509
[Ronnie] Kay Bear!

17:22.542 --> 17:26.579
I did some
pre-emptive shopping
for the fashion show!

17:26.613 --> 17:28.481
The early bird gets
the peep-toe, right?

17:28.515 --> 17:31.584
- Cute.
- Oh! I have
something to show you.

17:31.618 --> 17:35.488
This would look gorge on us.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.490
Chartreuse
with a hoop earring.

17:37.524 --> 17:41.428
- Mom...
- It's very Sophia Loren.

17:41.461 --> 17:45.498
- We're going to have
so much fun together!
- Uh-huh.

17:45.532 --> 17:47.500
Hey, how old were you
when you met Dad?

17:47.534 --> 17:51.338
- Young. Very young.
- So...

17:51.371 --> 17:56.143
...you, you must have had sex
pretty young too then, right?

17:56.176 --> 18:00.580
Yeah, but we were in love
and, you know, we got married
and that was that.

18:00.613 --> 18:03.116
Well, how did you know
you were ready?

18:03.150 --> 18:05.118
- For marriage?
- N... That's...

18:05.152 --> 18:09.256
Well, I'd had a career since
I was 16, I had traveled and
seen the world.

18:09.289 --> 18:14.227
I had a top 40 single.
So, sure I could have
gone on to bigger successes

18:14.261 --> 18:17.230
and even more singles,
but who knows?

18:17.264 --> 18:21.168
Maybe then I would have
missed out on your father,
and having you and your brother.

18:21.201 --> 18:22.535
So of course I was ready.

18:22.569 --> 18:26.206
Lucky for you, you don't
even have to think about
boys and marriage

18:26.239 --> 18:28.141
'cause you have
your gymnastics.

18:28.175 --> 18:33.413
And someday,
when you are ready
for boys and safe sex,

18:33.446 --> 18:36.616
you know, just make sure
it's with someone
you truly love.

18:36.649 --> 18:39.452
Oh! Now there's something
to think about:

18:39.486 --> 18:42.189
statement jewelry!

18:46.493 --> 18:48.695
[Ronnie] Kay,
you have a visitor.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.597
[exasperated sigh]

18:51.931 --> 18:54.501
That bible-thumping hoochie mama
has invaded my life!

18:54.534 --> 18:57.370
- Summer?
- I'm losing my father
to Churchy McChurchkins!

18:57.404 --> 19:00.640
- Lo, you'll be OK.
- We went out to dinner
and she made us say grace.

19:00.673 --> 19:04.511
Like the entire restaurant
has to know how grateful
I am for a Cobb salad.

19:05.612 --> 19:09.716
Well, I have something
to cheer you up.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.951
It's a secret.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.586
And I know how much
you love secrets.

19:13.620 --> 19:16.456
Finally! Something fun!

19:17.557 --> 19:19.726
OK.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.494
I've decided...

19:21.528 --> 19:23.596
I'm ready to do it
with Carter.

19:29.001 --> 19:32.739
Ladies, you each need
to decide on two looks.

19:32.772 --> 19:37.477
Two outfits? This is
going to be so much fun!

19:39.246 --> 19:41.648
- Emily!
- Sorry.

19:41.681 --> 19:44.751
Before I talk, I have to decide
if I'm comfortable with
the whole planet knowing.

19:44.784 --> 19:48.655
- [scoffs]
- Yeah. Two outfits.
Super fun.

19:48.688 --> 19:51.658
Team Tanner.
Team Smokin' hot.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.627
Not short enough.

19:54.661 --> 19:56.763
Not low cut enough.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.399
Can we just hurry up

19:59.432 --> 20:01.768
and not pretend like
this isn't torture?

20:01.801 --> 20:05.738
I think this would be
pretty on you.

20:05.772 --> 20:08.408
I think it looks like
a piece of cake.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.243
OK, now look
at this, please?

20:10.277 --> 20:12.612
Look, it's, like,
it's a little
"ladies who lunch,"

20:12.645 --> 20:17.384
but I think with the right
accessories we can really
spice it up, don't you?

20:17.417 --> 20:19.786
Hey, Ronnie, do you have
any more of these?

20:19.819 --> 20:22.789
- You know what Coco Chanel
used to say?
- Uh-uh.

20:22.822 --> 20:25.658
"Elegance is refusal."

20:25.692 --> 20:28.761
Yeah, well, I don't know
anyone would could refuse
these awesome bangles!

20:28.795 --> 20:31.464
Whoo-hoo! [laughing]
They're fun.

20:31.498 --> 20:33.266
Hmm...

20:33.300 --> 20:35.535
What do you think
this is, a funeral?

20:35.568 --> 20:38.638
The idea is to be sexy.
Just let me do this.

20:38.671 --> 20:42.509
I just need you
to walk down the runway, OK?

20:42.542 --> 20:45.612
- [groans]
- So glad we could have
this bonding moment.

20:45.645 --> 20:49.516
Mom, I can't believe
I cancelled resistance
training for this.

20:51.484 --> 20:54.287
Don't worry about her,
I've pulled her a few things.

20:54.321 --> 20:56.623
- It was you I wanted to see.
- What?

20:56.656 --> 20:59.792
I knew it.
The plum chiffon.

20:59.826 --> 21:02.562
I couldn't. I never wear
anything I can't tumble dry.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.564
You can and you will.

21:04.597 --> 21:08.535
Look at this
décolletage. You have
some dangerous curves.

21:08.568 --> 21:10.803
I say let's make
the most of them!

21:10.837 --> 21:13.573
Whoa! Right. Can I have
some fries with that?

21:13.606 --> 21:16.042
Maybe I'll get
the boobie prize...

21:16.075 --> 21:18.578
Better not get
a chest cold. [laughs]

21:18.611 --> 21:20.847
OK, there is nothing
wrong with strutting
your stuff, Kim.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.716
We're still gonna
take you seriously.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.585
And you have got
some stuff!

21:25.618 --> 21:28.855
- So love your body, baby.
- Right.

21:28.888 --> 21:30.723
Mom, can you please
help me...

21:30.757 --> 21:32.525
Just a second, honey.

21:32.559 --> 21:35.428
Drop the steamer!
That is a waffle organza!

21:35.462 --> 21:36.763
Rookies.

21:38.365 --> 21:40.667
Oh! Ohh!

21:40.700 --> 21:43.470
Hot potato. You have
to try this on.

21:43.503 --> 21:47.340
Oh, come on. For me, please?
Please, please, please, please?

21:47.374 --> 21:50.377
- OK, OK!
- Come on. Yay!

21:50.410 --> 21:52.879
Ugh! All the best dresses
have so been taken.

21:52.912 --> 21:55.615
There are still
a lot of cute things
to choose from.

21:55.648 --> 21:58.418
I'm sure you'd be thrilled
if we could wear turtlenecks.

22:03.155 --> 22:05.124
Turtlenecks
can be very sexy.

22:05.157 --> 22:07.427
The question is,
who are you
putting it on for,

22:07.460 --> 22:10.497
- you or a guy?
- A guy. Duh.

22:10.530 --> 22:13.400
Lauren, I saw you talking
to Carter today...

22:13.433 --> 22:15.602
Forget it. I'm not
gonna be judged
by Church Lady.

22:15.635 --> 22:17.770
Wait! I am not here
to judge you.

22:17.804 --> 22:20.607
- Right.
- I just... I wanted
to say that...

22:21.541 --> 22:22.842
I understand.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.944
What could you
possibly understand?

22:26.879 --> 22:30.617
Listen,
when I was your age,

22:30.650 --> 22:32.752
I didn't feel like
I existed

22:32.785 --> 22:35.688
unless boys were
paying attention to me.

22:35.722 --> 22:37.824
A lot of boys.

22:39.559 --> 22:43.430
And that need led me
to some really sad places.

22:43.463 --> 22:45.698
You did it in high school?

22:45.732 --> 22:48.635
With boys? Plural?

22:51.471 --> 22:54.941
In high school, I was
voted "class flirt."

22:54.974 --> 22:56.643
Boy, did I earn it.

22:57.977 --> 23:02.749
All that attention from guys
made me feel so popular and sexy

23:02.782 --> 23:04.817
and more mature
than the other girls.

23:06.686 --> 23:08.921
Until there was
this one guy...

23:08.955 --> 23:11.724
Tom Benson,
who I really liked.

23:13.460 --> 23:15.428
I thought the reason
he hadn't asked me out

23:15.462 --> 23:17.664
was because he was
intimidated by me,

23:17.697 --> 23:21.501
you know, 'cause
I was the class flirt.

23:21.534 --> 23:22.869
So I thought
I'd help him out,

23:22.902 --> 23:25.905
and I'd ask him
to dance at homecoming.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.643
And when I walked up
behind him...

23:32.512 --> 23:34.514
...I heard him
talking about me.

23:36.683 --> 23:38.818
And he was
referring to me

23:38.851 --> 23:42.221
as "one dirty Summer,
the class slut."

23:42.254 --> 23:45.858
And it just...

23:45.892 --> 23:47.994
...shattered me,
actually.

23:48.027 --> 23:49.962
That's sad.

23:50.963 --> 23:52.665
Yeah. It was.

23:52.699 --> 23:55.935
I was just a little girl,
looking for attention.

23:56.803 --> 23:58.505
Right.

24:00.707 --> 24:02.842
Look, Lauren, I'm...

24:02.875 --> 24:07.013
I'm not that comfortable
sharing this part
of my life.

24:07.046 --> 24:10.550
- Your dad
doesn't even know.
- Really?

24:12.652 --> 24:14.921
I just wanted to have
a chat with you

24:14.954 --> 24:17.690
that no one
ever had with me.

24:17.724 --> 24:20.627
Because once
I gave myself away...

24:21.661 --> 24:25.498
...I lost something
so important

24:25.532 --> 24:27.800
that would take me
years to get back.

24:28.935 --> 24:30.603
What?

24:31.771 --> 24:33.072
My self-respect.

24:36.976 --> 24:39.779
I'm gonna go find us
some dresses, OK?

24:39.812 --> 24:41.681
Yeah.
I'll be right there.

24:48.955 --> 24:50.690
[sniffles]

24:58.665 --> 25:02.702
Honey, I'm sorry.
Just had to grab these.
We can go now.

25:02.735 --> 25:04.904
Training day's shot anyways.

25:06.639 --> 25:09.742
My mother would hate
this fashion show.

25:09.776 --> 25:12.545
- Gran?
- In fact, she kind of
made fun of girls

25:12.579 --> 25:15.982
who fussed
with all that stuff.
She thought it was silly.

25:16.015 --> 25:19.118
And I think
maybe I do that, too.

25:20.720 --> 25:24.691
I think I got the idea
that being girly was weak.

25:24.724 --> 25:28.961
Maybe I just
play down everything
just to protect myself.

25:28.995 --> 25:33.700
I don't know. All I know is,
I do not want to pass
any of this onto you.

25:33.733 --> 25:36.703
I hate this stupid
fashion show!

25:36.736 --> 25:39.672
I feel like the Incredible Hulk
up there next to all
the pretty Barbie dolls.

25:39.706 --> 25:41.874
- Payson?
- Boys don't look at me

25:41.908 --> 25:43.309
the way they look at
Kaylie or Lauren.

25:43.342 --> 25:45.712
I would just rather not
sell tickets to it, OK?

25:45.745 --> 25:49.649
Payson, you are a strong,
graceful young woman,

25:49.682 --> 25:51.584
and boys do notice you.

25:51.618 --> 25:53.853
You're my mom.
You're supposed to say that.

25:53.886 --> 25:56.889
I see it.
Here at the gym.

25:56.923 --> 25:59.025
I just think
you don't notice them.

26:01.861 --> 26:04.831
Sasha said I need to marry
my beauty with my brawn.

26:04.864 --> 26:06.733
I don't even know
what that means.

26:06.766 --> 26:09.736
Have you ever seen
those women
in other countries

26:09.769 --> 26:11.971
who carry their children
on their backs,

26:12.004 --> 26:14.807
who are farming
and building a home,

26:14.841 --> 26:17.944
and they're still just
incredibly beautiful?

26:17.977 --> 26:21.147
Some of those cultures
celebrate those women
like goddesses.

26:22.649 --> 26:25.017
What could be more sexy

26:25.051 --> 26:28.054
than the combination
of strong and feminine?

26:28.855 --> 26:29.656
I guess.

- Oh, yes.

26:36.696 --> 26:39.131

right now!

You look like such a nerd
when you say that.

That's the key
to the whole thing.

- Oh, all right. Come on.

- Things going OK?
- We had a really nice talk.

For the first time, I think
we're actually connecting.

in the world or what?

is supposed to be

in the show, I might
as well be invisible.

- Isn't that Emily's dress?

We switched.

go out there

about what happened?

36:16.575 --> 36:19.745
Not much. Because my mother
doesn't give a crap about me.

36:19.778 --> 36:23.282
At least that's what I got
the last time she stumbled in.

36:23.315 --> 36:24.650
Hey...

36:24.683 --> 36:28.186
Steve, what is she
talking about?

36:30.456 --> 36:34.593
Lauren's mother
isn't a relief worker,
she's an addict.

36:34.626 --> 36:38.297
The last time we saw her
was at a... at a county rehab

36:38.330 --> 36:41.600
that she checked herself
out of the next day.

36:41.633 --> 36:43.969
She loved getting high...

36:44.002 --> 36:46.605
...more than her own kid.

36:46.638 --> 36:49.375
Or me.

36:49.408 --> 36:52.278
Wow. That's a pretty big
piece of information.

36:53.579 --> 36:55.781
Why wouldn't you tell me?

37:02.288 --> 37:04.323
Damon. How did you
get in here?

37:04.356 --> 37:06.525
They sell tickets to civilians.

37:06.558 --> 37:09.328
Not cheap, but I gotta say,
your little show...

37:09.361 --> 37:12.431
- ...was worth every cent.
- Yeah.

37:13.432 --> 37:16.268
So, are those for me?

37:16.302 --> 37:19.571
Nah, I just, you know,
carry 'em everywhere.
Aromatherapy.

37:21.072 --> 37:23.008
But if you want 'em...

37:23.041 --> 37:25.277
- Thanks.
- You know, you're right.

37:25.311 --> 37:26.612
You're not a Rock girl.

37:26.645 --> 37:28.614
You're something else
entirely.

37:28.647 --> 37:30.682
Here you go, big spender.

37:30.716 --> 37:32.684
Thank you for
supporting our girls.

37:32.718 --> 37:34.386
Any time, ma'am.

37:34.420 --> 37:36.688
You...
you bid on my outfit?

37:36.722 --> 37:40.626
- That must have
cost you a fortune.
- Are you kidding?

37:40.659 --> 37:43.829
I consider it a wise investment.
I'm going to sell it on eBay
when you become a gold medalist.

37:43.862 --> 37:47.599
- If.
- Hey. When.

37:54.072 --> 37:56.775
Emily, sweetie!

37:56.808 --> 38:01.513
And sometimes your
peanut butter gets mixed up
with your chocolate!

38:03.081 --> 38:05.851
That handsome boy bought
your jacket, didn't he?

38:05.884 --> 38:09.655
I guess it's a must-have
item this season.

38:14.460 --> 38:16.562
- Good job, Ronnie.
- Take care.

38:16.595 --> 38:20.566
Lauren, was there a, uh,
little mix-up back there?

38:20.599 --> 38:22.768
Look, there's something
you should know.

38:24.736 --> 38:28.106
Carter's sneaking into
Kaylie's room tonight and
they're going to have sex.

38:28.139 --> 38:31.377
She won't listen to me,
so I thought
I'd better tell you.

38:55.701 --> 38:58.537
What's all this?
Electricity go out?

39:03.709 --> 39:05.644
I want you
to make love to me.

39:05.677 --> 39:06.812
What?

39:08.414 --> 39:10.616
Ah, jeez. Kay, listen,
we need to talk.

39:10.649 --> 39:12.584
- Talk?
- Yeah.

39:12.618 --> 39:14.586
- [knock on door]
- [Ronnie] Kaylie?

39:14.620 --> 39:16.354
Can I come in?

39:21.660 --> 39:24.396
- Kaylie?
- Give me a second.

39:26.698 --> 39:27.866
OK, come in.

39:29.635 --> 39:31.803
Oh, it's, uh...

39:31.837 --> 39:34.406
...nice in here
with all the candles lit.

39:34.440 --> 39:37.943
Yeah. Yeah, it's, um,
it's a new thing.
Helps me relax.

39:37.976 --> 39:39.945
Uh-huh.

39:39.978 --> 39:42.414
You mind if I sit?

39:42.848 --> 39:44.750
Uh... sure.

39:46.852 --> 39:49.721
Listen, I...
I want you to know

39:49.755 --> 39:51.723
that, you know, I do
tend to get absorbed

39:51.757 --> 39:56.194
- in things superficial.
- That's no problem.
It happens.

39:56.227 --> 39:59.798
And sometimes I have
trouble seeing what's
right in front of me.

40:01.767 --> 40:06.705
When you were born,
I was so excited
to have a little girl.

40:06.738 --> 40:11.643
I imagined having tea parties
and dress up and dollhouses,

40:11.677 --> 40:13.812
and I just thought we'd be
best friends, you know?

40:13.845 --> 40:17.983
Then you fell in love
with gymnastics,
which was your dad's world,

40:18.016 --> 40:20.852
and then there wasn't room
for all that stuff.

40:20.886 --> 40:22.988
Yet I love that you have
your gymnastics

40:23.021 --> 40:25.691
and that you get
to share that with your dad.

40:27.859 --> 40:30.796
But there's just not really
any place in it for me.

40:32.531 --> 40:33.665
And I just miss
my little girl.

40:33.699 --> 40:36.902
- Oh, Mom, sorry...
- No, I'm sorry.

40:36.935 --> 40:38.904
Sorry I didn't
open up to you more

40:38.937 --> 40:41.640
when you asked me about
your father the other day.

40:43.509 --> 40:47.746
I stand by all the choices
I've made in my life, Kaylie.

40:47.779 --> 40:51.517
But I was young.
I was too young,

40:51.550 --> 40:55.554
but I was in love and...
I chose your father.

40:56.722 --> 40:59.591
You know, it took me
years later to realize

40:59.625 --> 41:03.629
that if it's real,
love will wait.

41:03.662 --> 41:05.997
But certain
opportunities won't.

41:06.898 --> 41:08.900
Like your gymnastics.

41:10.702 --> 41:13.705
You know, you've got
this one shot

41:13.739 --> 41:15.641
at achieving your dreams.

41:15.674 --> 41:17.843
If you lose your focus now

41:17.876 --> 41:22.548
on, say, getting
too involved with a boy...

41:24.550 --> 41:26.785
...you're gonna
throw it all away.

41:26.818 --> 41:29.020
I don't want to see you
waste your talent.

41:31.723 --> 41:34.560
- Do you understand
what I'm trying to say?
- Yeah.

41:34.593 --> 41:36.762
OK. Come here.

41:43.802 --> 41:46.605
- Did I answer
your question?
- Yeah.

41:47.939 --> 41:49.074
Sweet dreams.

41:54.846 --> 41:57.048
- [Kaylie] Good night.
- Good night.

42:08.059 --> 42:09.728
Buzzkill.

42:16.902 --> 42:18.937
You don't want to hear this,

42:18.970 --> 42:21.707
but... she's right.

42:21.740 --> 42:23.675
We should at least wait
until after Nationals.

42:23.709 --> 42:27.545
- Do you not think I'm sexy?
- Oh, Kaylie.

42:29.147 --> 42:30.949
You're my dream girl.

42:31.950 --> 42:33.852
You're all I want.

42:33.885 --> 42:36.955
I think about being
with you night and day.

42:38.724 --> 42:42.694
I don't want us
to be a distraction
before Nationals.

42:42.728 --> 42:45.897
You only get one shot at
making the Olympic team,

42:45.931 --> 42:47.699
one shot.

42:48.399 --> 42:49.935
I love you so much.

42:51.169 --> 42:53.739
I don't want anything
getting in the way of that,

42:53.772 --> 42:54.906
even if it's me.

42:57.375 --> 43:00.846
[sighs] I am
so lucky to have you.

43:00.879 --> 43:03.815
Can't we just be
together forever?

43:06.785 --> 43:08.654
Forever.

43:08.687 --> 43:10.822
- No matter what.
- OK.

43:10.856 --> 43:12.057
OK.

43:27.706 --> 43:29.775
Don't ever doubt it.
