WEBVTT

00:06.005 --> 00:07.674
WhaWhat's up, man?an?

00:15.515 --> 00:16.265
What?

00:16.349 --> 00:18.309
What?

00:18.393 --> 00:21.479
Nothing. I'm
just... impressed.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.940
I mean, I guess the guilt

00:24.023 --> 00:25.859
isn't keeping you up
at nights, right?

00:29.904 --> 00:31.781
Um, cream and sugar, right?

00:31.865 --> 00:34.576
Uh, no. Actually,
I-I drink it black.

00:34.659 --> 00:36.828
Right. I should have known that.

00:36.911 --> 00:41.249
(laughs):
It's okay.

00:41.332 --> 00:43.418
You know, Donna,
I'm really glad

00:43.501 --> 00:45.086
that you and Noah
worked things out.

00:45.170 --> 00:48.131
Yeah, he said the pictures
with Gina didn't mean anything,

00:48.214 --> 00:49.966
and I chose to believe him.

00:50.049 --> 00:51.009
Good.

00:51.092 --> 00:52.218
Yeah.

00:52.302 --> 00:54.304
I mean, you know, you and I
should be the first to admit

00:54.387 --> 00:55.972
that sometimes
a kiss is just a kiss.

00:56.055 --> 00:58.266
Yeah. We should, shouldn't we?

00:58.349 --> 00:59.768
(laughs)

00:59.851 --> 01:01.811
Thank you.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.271
So anyway, the wedding
finally gets started,

01:03.354 --> 01:04.772
and it's, like,
3,000 degrees outside...

01:04.855 --> 01:07.150
{\an5}And the minister,
he's just going on
and on and on...

01:07.233 --> 01:09.152
And on, and he takes
this big pause.

01:09.235 --> 01:10.528
Right.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.697
{\an1}Ah... I'm,
like, "Excuse me,y?

01:12.781 --> 01:14.199
shouldn't I kiss
the bride now?"

01:14.282 --> 01:16.493
Oh, so everyone can hear--
wow, you're very smooth.

01:16.576 --> 01:19.204
LAUREN: And then the
MATT: Uh, what'd he say?

01:19.287 --> 01:21.164
{\an1}Oh, he got serious on us,
he got, like, deadpan.

01:21.247 --> 01:22.165
{\an1}Remember that
Yeah.he gave me?

01:22.248 --> 01:24.501
{\an1}He gave me this look,
and he's, like, "No, son,

01:24.584 --> 01:27.170
{\an1}it's usually considered good
manners if I marry you first."

01:27.253 --> 01:28.755
{\an1}Wow! And she still
married you.

01:28.838 --> 01:30.173
It's definitely true love.

01:30.256 --> 01:31.508
Oh, iOh, yeah.'t it?

01:31.591 --> 01:32.509
Yeah.

01:32.592 --> 01:34.594
Yeah, it is.

01:34.677 --> 01:36.513
You guys, eat, please.

01:36.596 --> 01:38.264
Steve?

01:39.474 --> 01:40.892
Hey.

01:40.975 --> 01:43.019
I was looking for Steve.

01:43.102 --> 01:44.771
He wanted to borrow this.

01:44.854 --> 01:46.189
DAVID:
He and Janet

01:46.272 --> 01:47.941
had to run up to <i> The Beat.</i>

01:49.359 --> 01:50.527
I'm glad you're here.
You want to...

01:50.610 --> 01:52.654
{\an1}No.e in?

01:52.737 --> 01:55.698
No, I just wanted
to drop off this...

01:55.782 --> 01:57.242
Sleeping bag.

01:57.325 --> 02:00.036
Sleeping bag.

02:00.119 --> 02:01.663
{\an5}LAUREN:
We have plenty
of food here.

02:01.746 --> 02:03.665
I mean, you... I can
make you a plate.

02:03.748 --> 02:04.707
GINA:
You should come in.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.000
They were actually
just telling us

02:06.084 --> 02:07.877
{\an1}about their wedding.
Oh, you were gonna tell us

02:07.961 --> 02:08.919
about the No.gs, right?

02:09.002 --> 02:11.589
{\an1}No, look, it was nothing.
Um, why don't you stay?

02:13.591 --> 02:17.303
No. You know, I just remembered,
I have to go.

02:18.805 --> 02:19.639
Kel.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.017
Kel, come on.

02:23.101 --> 02:24.811
{\an1}Look, Matt wanted
to invite you,

02:24.894 --> 02:27.105
{\an1}and I told him you'd
probably be uncomfortable.

02:27.188 --> 02:28.231
Aren't you a genius.

02:28.314 --> 02:30.733
Kel, it's uncomfortable
for everybody.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.193
Yeah, I'm sure Matt
being married

02:32.277 --> 02:34.028
is a real hardship for you.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.530
Don't make us pick sides.

02:35.613 --> 02:38.449
Take a look around, Dylan;
you already have.

02:40.493 --> 02:41.953

with Super Sisters

04:23.388 --> 04:25.014
and Super Brothers
of Los Angeles.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.099
Say hi to Janet Sosna.

Why don't you drop that

04:27.767 --> 04:29.852
{\an1}Oh, Janet has a little

04:29.936 --> 04:30.812
No, Janet doesn't like

04:30.895 --> 04:33.356
that Steve is horning
in on Janet's plans.

I know. I did the orientation.

04:43.825 --> 04:46.369
Yeah, but I seem to remember
that your little Super Brother

Do you know anything

04:55.878 --> 04:57.046
about camping?

04:57.130 --> 04:58.548
No. But we have

05:50.141 --> 05:51.768
Yeah, I'll hold.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.436
You think it's a good idea?

05:53.519 --> 05:55.104
Oh, I think that's
such a good idea.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.814
Are you kidding?

05:56.898 --> 05:58.441

{\an1}I'll take it anyway.
Yeah, the name of the guests

06:08.701 --> 06:10.787
are Matt and Lauren Durning.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.288
Uh-huh.

06:12.371 --> 06:14.832
Uh, sometime
this evening.

06:14.916 --> 06:16.626
Um, you know what?

06:16.709 --> 06:19.087
{\an1}I'm gonna-- ow-- I'm gonna
have to call you back. What?

06:19.170 --> 06:20.963
NothinHey, whoa,to go.

06:21.047 --> 06:21.964
hey, wait a minute.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.508
I owe Matt.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.009
Okay?
The guy's done a lot for me.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.469
Yeah, Dylan, Matt's great.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.304
The guy never even
had a honeymoon.

06:28.387 --> 06:30.306
I think now's
a good time.

06:30.389 --> 06:32.308
Well, you're very romantic.

06:32.391 --> 06:33.810
So, I don't get it--
wh-what's your problem exactly?

06:33.893 --> 06:35.978
I'm doing Matt a favor,
so you're acting like this?

06:36.062 --> 06:37.480
You know what,
the problem is not that

06:37.563 --> 06:38.564
you're doing him a favor, okay?

06:38.648 --> 06:40.817
The problem is that
if you rented the room for us,

06:40.900 --> 06:42.610
you'd probably rent it
by the hour, right?

06:45.279 --> 06:47.323
(quietly):
Right.

06:48.866 --> 06:50.201
(door slams)

06:53.204 --> 06:54.956
{\an1}Hey.cking)

06:55.039 --> 06:56.958
{\an1}You got an interview
going later?

06:57.041 --> 06:58.626
Yeah. Kelly's
gonna help me out.

06:58.709 --> 07:00.128
I guess hearing other
people's problems

07:00.211 --> 07:02.088
will take her mind
off of her own.

07:02.171 --> 07:03.965
{\an1}I don't get it-- calling
strangers for advice.

07:04.048 --> 07:05.174
(laughs):
Neither do I.

07:05.258 --> 07:08.094
90% of the time I don't even
know what I'm talking about.

07:08.177 --> 07:09.846
Well, whatever you
told Donna, it worked.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.097
I didn't tell Donna anything.

07:11.180 --> 07:13.558
We're fighting, you take her
to this Valentine's Day party,

07:13.641 --> 07:14.642
she comes home, all's forgiven.

07:14.725 --> 07:16.894
Ah, that, right.

07:16.978 --> 07:19.021
Well, whatever you
told her, thank you.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.690
Sure, no problem.
My pleasure.

07:20.773 --> 07:23.568
It's kind of why I want
your take on something.

07:23.651 --> 07:25.903
All right.

07:25.987 --> 07:27.905
{\an1}Look, the real reason
we were fighting

07:27.989 --> 07:29.240
on Valentine's Day
was because...

07:29.323 --> 07:31.033
Yeah, pictures with Gina.
I know.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.535
What we were doing in them.

07:32.618 --> 07:34.912
You were drunk, you kissed.

07:34.996 --> 07:37.248
Noah, it's no big deal;
it's ancient history.

07:37.331 --> 07:38.875
There's more.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.961
I don't know
if I want to hear this.

07:42.044 --> 07:43.588
Look, you said it,
right, I was drunk.

07:43.671 --> 07:45.548
I don't want to lose her,
and this thing

07:45.631 --> 07:46.924
we're talking about,
it was meaningless, right?

07:47.008 --> 07:49.051
So I'm just gonna tell her.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.429
I really got
to get back to work.

07:51.512 --> 07:52.722
We've been through worse, right?

07:52.805 --> 07:53.848
Noah.

07:53.931 --> 07:55.892
What? I mean, that's what
you do, you give advice.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.560
I can't help you here, okay?

07:57.643 --> 07:59.437
I'm sorry.

08:00.521 --> 08:02.565
Right.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.901
Look, until I get
a chance to talk to her...

08:04.984 --> 08:06.903
Don't worry.
It's confidential.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.404
All right. Thanks.

08:08.487 --> 08:10.531
I appreciate it.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.253
Ever try Santeria?

08:24.337 --> 08:25.922
Uh, yeah,

08:26.005 --> 08:27.423
once in the shower, I think.

08:27.506 --> 08:28.758
(birds chirping)

08:28.841 --> 08:30.885
Say, you two ever had sex?

08:36.682 --> 08:38.768
Oh, my God.

08:38.851 --> 08:40.436
(animal grunting, panting)

08:42.520 --> 08:43.981
All right, everybody,
go to the car.

08:44.065 --> 08:46.609
Walk slowly.

08:46.692 --> 08:49.028
(growls)

08:51.864 --> 08:54.617
(panting, growling)

08:55.993 --> 08:58.120
(growls)

08:58.204 --> 09:00.623
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

09:00.706 --> 09:02.124
Open-open the door!

09:02.208 --> 09:05.086
(bear growls)

09:05.169 --> 09:06.921
(both scream)

09:07.004 --> 09:09.131
{\an5}JANET:
Oh, my God! I can't believe
you left the food out, Steve!

09:09.215 --> 09:10.258
STEVE:
I didn't leave it out,

09:10.341 --> 09:11.092
I left it up.

09:11.175 --> 09:12.301
JANET:
You left it up?

09:12.385 --> 09:13.594
This is great. Good.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.096
STEVE (knocking on glass):
Go away.

09:15.179 --> 09:16.973
Beat it. Go away. Go away.

09:17.056 --> 09:19.100
((both yell))

09:19.183 --> 09:22.436
(slow dance music plays)

09:22.520 --> 09:23.938
How long has it been?

09:24.021 --> 09:26.941
{\an5}GIRL:
It'll be seven weeks
this Sunday at 2:00 a.m.

09:27.024 --> 09:28.484
He was perfect.

09:28.567 --> 09:30.528
I know he may seem that way now,

09:30.611 --> 09:33.572
but this is the person
who hurt you.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.908
Just think about it-- while
you're crying your eyes out

09:35.992 --> 09:37.326
every night,
he's crawling into bed

09:37.410 --> 09:39.787
with somebody who can
make him feel a lot better.

09:39.870 --> 09:42.373
My ex-boyfriend
isn't seeing anyone else.

09:42.456 --> 09:44.875
Well, you're lucky. Mine is.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.043
(chuckles):
Okay.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.838
Thanks for calling.
Good luck.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.299
Should we take a break?

09:51.382 --> 09:52.466
No, I'm sorry.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.218
I will get a grip.

09:56.804 --> 09:58.472
(sighs)

09:58.556 --> 10:00.808
You're on with
David and Kelly.

10:00.891 --> 10:02.810
MATT:
Time does heal.

10:02.893 --> 10:05.855
It's hackneyed and overused,
but it is a fact.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.401
I wish I could believe you.

10:10.484 --> 10:12.570
Well, you fall in love
with a person,

10:12.653 --> 10:15.031
the life you're gonna have,
and then it's gone...

10:15.114 --> 10:17.867
it hurts, you rage, and...

10:17.950 --> 10:22.288
and then one day you realize
that you're not angry anymore.

10:22.371 --> 10:24.165
You're sad.

10:24.248 --> 10:27.043
Pretty soon you let yourself
be a little happy.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.211
And then when you're sipping
on a coffee,

10:29.295 --> 10:30.880
reading a newspaper...

10:30.963 --> 10:34.216
In the courtyard,
totally unaware...

10:34.300 --> 10:37.720
...you see somebody
smiling at you,

10:37.803 --> 10:40.473
reminding you that you're alive,

10:40.556 --> 10:42.892
that everything <i> can</i> turn around.

10:42.975 --> 10:45.061
How often
do you think that happens?

10:45.144 --> 10:47.563
It happens when you're ready,

10:47.646 --> 10:49.690
sometimes even when you're not.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.819
Thank you, caller.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.405
♪ ♪

10:56.489 --> 10:58.240
That was pretty intense.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.076
I can't believe
it was really Matt.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.078
It was Matt.

11:02.161 --> 11:05.539
The way he described
how they met, how he felt.

11:05.623 --> 11:06.749
So what do you think? I mean...

11:06.832 --> 11:07.917
you think they'll
still be friends?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.418
In time, I'm sure.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.754
{\an1}I mean, it's not like
he cheated on her

11:11.837 --> 11:12.880
or lied to her or anything.

11:12.963 --> 11:15.091
So you're saying that would be
hard to forgive, right?

11:15.174 --> 11:16.759
Oh, yeah, light-years.

11:16.842 --> 11:19.637
{\an1}Well, what did you want
to talk to me about?

11:19.720 --> 11:21.097
Uh, nothing. Forget it.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.099
What?

11:23.182 --> 11:26.644
(sighs) I was just wondering...

11:28.521 --> 11:31.732
Look, I was wondering if, um...

11:31.816 --> 11:33.442
you want to live together.

11:35.694 --> 11:36.612
Noah...

11:36.695 --> 11:37.530
We've been through so much,

11:37.613 --> 11:39.323
it just seems like
the next step, you know?

11:39.407 --> 11:42.284
I don't know what to say.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.453
Well, you could try saying yes.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.081
Unless you don't
want toYes.en I...

11:47.164 --> 11:49.458
Yeah, yes, yes,
I'll move in with you.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.626
Mm...

11:50.709 --> 11:52.545
I love you.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.220
(Hawaiian music playing)

12:07.226 --> 12:08.310
Hey.

12:08.394 --> 12:10.479
Hey.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.148
(hums along with melody)

12:12.231 --> 12:16.527
That is for our Dylan-supplied
naughty evening at the Bel Age.

12:18.737 --> 12:20.823
Um, I don't think
I'll be needing that.

12:22.074 --> 12:25.619
Uh, I know what you're doing.

12:25.703 --> 12:28.289
Planning on staying in the room
the whole time, are you?

12:28.372 --> 12:30.416
I think I can
adjust to that.

12:30.499 --> 12:32.501
{\an1}Hmm?...

12:32.585 --> 12:36.547
{\an1}I'm, uh... I was
just at the doctor,

12:36.630 --> 12:42.344
and my white blood
cell count is down.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.513
All right,
so what's the plan?

12:44.597 --> 12:46.807
We stop by the
pharmacy on the way or...?

12:46.891 --> 12:50.686
{\an1}The doctor wants me
to stop taking Clozapine.

12:53.105 --> 12:56.567
Wait, wait.
I don't understand.

12:56.650 --> 12:59.528
Won't you slip back?

12:59.612 --> 13:04.366
{\an1}I could be
institutionalized again.

13:04.450 --> 13:05.451
I, don't, I-I-I
don't understand, then.

13:05.534 --> 13:07.870
How can she possibly
suggest you stop taking it?

13:10.998 --> 13:16.462
{\an1}Because if I don't stop
taking it...

13:16.545 --> 13:18.380
{\an1}I'll die.

13:33.812 --> 13:35.814
(snoring)

13:37.775 --> 13:39.193
Steve?

13:39.276 --> 13:39.818
Mm...

13:39.902 --> 13:41.278
Steve, wake up. You're s...

13:41.362 --> 13:42.279
WaHmm?p!

13:42.363 --> 13:43.948
You're snoring in my face.

13:44.031 --> 13:46.242
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:48.035 --> 13:50.496
You think the bear's gone?

13:50.579 --> 13:54.250
Yeah, yep, along with the food.

13:56.502 --> 13:57.586
And the kids.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.296
{\an1}Yeah, the kids.
Remember,!

13:59.380 --> 14:02.132
the ones you said you'd wake up
early to keep an eye on?

14:02.216 --> 14:04.343
This is all
This your fault., huh?

14:04.426 --> 14:05.761
I caught them
making out.

14:05.844 --> 14:07.638
Marianne?!

14:07.721 --> 14:10.099
Stewart!

14:10.182 --> 14:10.599
Marianne!

14:10.683 --> 14:12.309
Stewart!

14:12.393 --> 14:14.562
{\an1}You think maybe
the bear got them?

14:14.645 --> 14:15.521
Marianne!

14:15.604 --> 14:17.398
Stewart!

14:20.568 --> 14:22.111
{\an1}Stewart??

14:40.921 --> 14:42.673
{\an1}It's not like I don't want
them to be happy.

14:42.756 --> 14:45.301
{\an1}I mean, I just don't want
a front-row seat.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.428
I did not invite you out
here this morning

14:47.511 --> 14:49.013
to hear you obsessing
about this.

14:49.096 --> 14:49.847
Don't do it.

14:49.930 --> 14:55.311
{\an1}And do what, sleep,
work, eat, focus?

14:55.394 --> 14:56.437
Oh, I don't know.

14:56.520 --> 15:00.774
Focus has never really
been my strong point, ever.

15:00.858 --> 15:03.819
Oh, man, '59 T-bird.

15:03.902 --> 15:06.864
You know, my uncle Hank used
to drive one of these.

15:06.947 --> 15:08.157
{\an1}Every morning,
he'd come rolling up,

15:08.240 --> 15:11.285
and I'd be out there all ready,
early before school. I'm telling

15:11.368 --> 15:14.163
you, this car is the thing
that got me up in the morning.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.205
What gets you up now?

15:15.289 --> 15:18.334
Well, for a while,
it was that community service.

15:18.417 --> 15:19.835
Now it's just sex with Gina.

15:19.918 --> 15:21.503
{\an1}Okay..

15:21.587 --> 15:22.338
Bad joke.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.381
That's just
a pleasant diversion.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.008
From what?

15:26.091 --> 15:29.178
Figuring out what to do
with the rest of my life.

15:29.261 --> 15:31.138
{\an1}Come on.

15:31.221 --> 15:33.307
{\an1}Come on...

15:39.396 --> 15:40.314
Hey.

15:40.397 --> 15:41.315
Hey.

15:41.398 --> 15:42.316
What's up?

15:42.399 --> 15:43.859
{\an1}I was just looking
for Kelly.

15:43.942 --> 15:45.694
{\an1}She seemed
a little on edge last night.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.821
Okay.eah, she's not around.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.698
Well, uh, tell her
I stopped by.

15:49.782 --> 15:50.699
You know,
I'm still waiting

15:50.783 --> 15:52.034
for my invite.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.036
Or have you forgotten
how great we were?

15:54.119 --> 15:57.373
{\an1}What?

15:57.456 --> 15:59.375
On the radio
in high school.

15:59.458 --> 16:03.212
No, I haven't forgotten.

16:04.338 --> 16:05.547
You okay?

16:05.631 --> 16:07.758
Yeah. Why, shouldn't I be?

16:07.841 --> 16:11.011
Well, I talked to Noah
last night,

16:11.095 --> 16:13.055
and he seemed
a little on edge, so...

16:13.138 --> 16:14.223
So you already know.

16:14.306 --> 16:15.391
Not exactly.

16:15.474 --> 16:16.850
The basics, you know?

16:16.934 --> 16:17.893
What do you think?

16:17.976 --> 16:18.894
Well...

16:18.977 --> 16:20.062
I mean, I think it's good.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.939
YYeah.?

16:22.022 --> 16:24.191
I mean, the way things
have been going between us,

16:24.274 --> 16:25.275
I guess I'm not surprised.

16:25.359 --> 16:28.362
But, oh, and Gina
already knows, but

16:28.445 --> 16:30.948
Kelly doesn't. I think
she might take it hard, so...

16:31.031 --> 16:32.783
What the hell
are you talking about?

16:32.866 --> 16:35.244
About Noah asking me
to move in with him.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.204
Why? What'd you think I was
talking about?

16:38.205 --> 16:39.748
That.

16:39.832 --> 16:43.210
You, you and Noah
moving in together.

16:43.293 --> 16:44.712
So, you think it's good, right?

16:44.795 --> 16:46.588
I think it's great.

16:47.464 --> 16:48.632
Congratulations.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.426
Thank you. (chuckles)

16:52.970 --> 16:54.888
MATT:
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

16:54.972 --> 16:56.765
Listen to me. I don't care
if the doctor is busy.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.308
My wife and I are coming down
there this evening,

16:58.392 --> 17:00.394
and she will see us.
Am I clear?

17:02.312 --> 17:04.397
I'll call you back.

17:06.066 --> 17:08.484
{\an1}I know that was you
on the radio last night.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.487
Kelly, this really isn't
a good time.

17:10.570 --> 17:12.781
Listen, I'm really trying
to work through this,

17:12.865 --> 17:14.992
but your friendly overtures
aren't making it

17:15.075 --> 17:15.992
very easy for me.

17:16.076 --> 17:17.703
That wasn't my intention.

17:17.786 --> 17:21.999
I know, but just hearing your
voice made me think of you

17:22.082 --> 17:25.711
and Lauren and your second
honeymoon...

17:25.794 --> 17:26.795
Look, you know what?

17:26.878 --> 17:29.882
There was no second honeymoon,
so I want you to go.

17:29.965 --> 17:32.050
So would I, but I can't.

17:32.134 --> 17:34.136
Fine. You know what? I will.

17:39.933 --> 17:42.019
Stew, you're gonna meet
tons of women.

17:42.102 --> 17:44.229
Beautiful,
intelligent women.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.481
Which is good, right?

17:45.564 --> 17:46.690
It's great.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.609
Eventually, one of them
will stand out

17:48.692 --> 17:49.610
more than the rest.

17:49.693 --> 17:52.321
But you won't be able
to put your finger on

17:52.404 --> 17:54.114
exactly why that is,

17:54.198 --> 17:56.116
and then she'll start
driving you crazy.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.159
Which is bad?

17:57.242 --> 17:59.495
Which is frustrating.

17:59.578 --> 18:02.831
Have I been hurt?
Oh, yeah, yes.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.666
Which is why
you're just gonna have

18:04.750 --> 18:05.959
to learn to protect yourself.

18:06.043 --> 18:08.670
Because there are gonna be guys
who are gonna come after you.

18:08.754 --> 18:11.840
{\an1}The wrong guys.
Bad, bad guys

18:11.924 --> 18:13.383
{\an1}who only have
one thing in mind.

18:13.467 --> 18:15.803
{\an1}So you're just gonna have
to turn them away...

18:15.886 --> 18:18.388
even if it kills you.

18:18.472 --> 18:19.848
Do you have any idea
what it's like

18:19.932 --> 18:21.809
to be in love with someone who
hates you?

18:21.892 --> 18:24.520
(groans) It's like the more
they diss you,

18:24.603 --> 18:26.355
the closer you want to be.

18:26.438 --> 18:28.357
I'm not a bad person, am I?

18:28.440 --> 18:29.358
Uh, no.

18:29.441 --> 18:31.068
{\an1}No, no, I'm good.
I'm decent.

18:31.151 --> 18:32.486
She should see that!

18:32.569 --> 18:35.823
{\an1}Why she doesn't
is beyond me.

18:35.906 --> 18:37.032
(sobbing)

18:37.115 --> 18:39.868
You really like
this guy, huh?

18:39.952 --> 18:42.287
Dude, it'll be okay.

18:57.302 --> 18:58.720
(soft chuckle)

19:14.027 --> 19:15.946
(birds chirping)

19:33.130 --> 19:34.631
(sighs)

19:36.508 --> 19:37.718
(snaps fingers)

19:37.801 --> 19:39.219
(mutters)

19:39.303 --> 19:41.805
I... like it.

19:47.311 --> 19:48.270
DR. MICHAELS:
<i>If you continue</i>

19:48.353 --> 19:49.479
taking Clozapine,

19:49.563 --> 19:51.231
you will get a-plastic anemia.

19:51.315 --> 19:53.692
When your white count drops
like this, you'll go septic.

19:53.775 --> 19:55.777
{\an1}Your organs will start
shutting down.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.321
Or you'll develop pneumonia,
or both.

19:57.404 --> 19:58.780
{\an1}Either way,
you're likely to die.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.824
{\an1}MATT: What are you talking
about, Doctor? How...?

20:00.908 --> 20:02.159
What are you talk...?
Are you talking years?

20:02.242 --> 20:03.285
Are you talking months?

20:03.368 --> 20:04.703
What are we looking at?

20:04.786 --> 20:06.997
Weeks, I'm afraid.
Maybe no more than two or three.

20:07.080 --> 20:08.790
And if I stop taking
the medication,

20:08.874 --> 20:10.459
how long before
I fall apart again?

20:10.542 --> 20:12.127
Same amount,
maybe less.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.170
You could suffer

20:13.253 --> 20:15.172
a psychotic episode
within a week.

20:15.255 --> 20:17.007
Within two,
rebound psychosis.

20:17.090 --> 20:19.509
Great. An episode worse
than ever before.

20:19.593 --> 20:21.637
{\an1}Oh, wait a minute. There's got
to be some other options.

20:21.720 --> 20:22.512
Some other choices.
Something that would

20:22.596 --> 20:24.306
{\an1}at least give us time
to think about it.

20:24.389 --> 20:25.849
No, we don't need time
to think, Matt. I'm not

20:25.933 --> 20:28.185
{\an1}going off the
I can't on. That's it.

20:28.268 --> 20:29.686
prescribe something
for you that will kill you.

20:29.770 --> 20:31.313
No doctor can.

20:31.396 --> 20:32.189
Are you serious?

20:32.272 --> 20:33.815
If you had any idea

20:33.899 --> 20:35.651
what it was like
to go through this...

20:35.734 --> 20:37.861
if you had any clue!

20:39.071 --> 20:40.656
{\an1}MATT: We'll just
have to talk

20:40.739 --> 20:42.658
There's nothing
to talk about, Matt.

20:42.741 --> 20:45.953
I am not going off
the medication.

20:56.421 --> 20:58.632
(rock music playing)

21:06.098 --> 21:09.810
{\an4}So, I hear that you
and Donna are looking
for apartments together.

21:09.893 --> 21:12.020
Why is it everything out of your
mouth sounds like a threat?

21:12.104 --> 21:13.188
Well, probably

21:13.271 --> 21:15.524
because Donna and I are getting
along really well, and I

21:15.607 --> 21:17.818
just don't want your guilty
conscience screwing things up.

21:17.901 --> 21:20.195
No, I'm the one who
sleeps nights, remember?

21:20.278 --> 21:22.364
Yeah, but you're such
a kind, decent guy.

21:22.447 --> 21:24.658
I mean, you're about to move in
with this girl

21:24.741 --> 21:26.076
you really care about.

21:26.159 --> 21:27.369
It must just be killing you

21:27.452 --> 21:29.454
to not be able
to tell her the truth.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.500
No matter what,
you better not ever tell Donna

21:33.583 --> 21:34.793
what really happened.

21:38.463 --> 21:40.048
{\an1}Hey.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.508
I'll see Okay.uys later.

21:41.591 --> 21:43.218
Sorry. An order arrived
late at the store.

21:43.301 --> 21:44.845
Total screw-up.
Can we still make it?

21:44.928 --> 21:47.055
Look,Well...wait.

21:47.139 --> 21:48.890
No, it's the last
duplex on Sixth Street.

21:48.974 --> 21:51.059
I love you.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.228
Well, I love you,
too, but right now,

21:53.311 --> 21:55.355
I'm thinking of crown moldings
and Spanish tile...

21:55.439 --> 21:56.356
I don't think
you understand

21:56.440 --> 21:57.566
how much you mean to me.

21:57.649 --> 21:59.693
Oh, no, I think
I have a vague idea.

21:59.776 --> 22:01.111
But, oh, you know what?

22:01.194 --> 22:03.447
Why don't you refresh my
memory on the way? Let's go.

22:03.530 --> 22:05.407
Look, I canceled
the appointment.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.075
Something wrong?

22:07.159 --> 22:10.120
The night Gina kissed me
in the photo booth...

22:11.163 --> 22:12.748
Yes?

22:15.459 --> 22:17.794
We slept together.

22:18.795 --> 22:21.214
{\an1}Donna, look, you know
how messed-up I...

22:21.298 --> 22:22.632
We're over.

22:22.716 --> 22:24.760
Donna, come on.

22:39.441 --> 22:40.442
(sighs)

22:41.902 --> 22:42.986
Where's Gina?

22:43.070 --> 22:43.987
{\an1}Gone.

22:44.071 --> 22:45.447
Hey, can you do me a favor?

22:45.530 --> 22:46.948
{\an1}Can you fill in for me
tonight on David's show?

22:47.032 --> 22:48.116
I'm just really not into it.

22:48.200 --> 22:51.119
{\an1}Noah's left you, like, 200
messages. Where have you been?

22:51.203 --> 22:52.329
Jann's Coffee Shop.

22:52.412 --> 22:53.371
{\an1}All night?

22:53.455 --> 22:54.456
Noah and I broke up.

22:54.539 --> 22:55.665
I-I need the phone.

22:55.749 --> 22:57.459
Hey, are you okay?

22:57.542 --> 22:59.711
{\an1}You know Gina's cell phone
number? Never mind. I got it.

22:59.795 --> 23:00.962
Wait. Hang on.
What happened?

23:01.046 --> 23:02.672
Hold on.

23:02.756 --> 23:06.134
{\an1}First I need a word with
my dear, dear cousin.

23:06.218 --> 23:07.803
What does Gina have
to do with this?

23:07.886 --> 23:09.721
Oh, everything.

23:09.805 --> 23:13.475
{\an5}RECORDING:
The cell phone you've dialed
is currently out of range.

23:17.562 --> 23:18.980
{\an1}Hi, Noah.

23:19.064 --> 23:21.316
Look, I couldn't stand
not being honest with her.

23:21.399 --> 23:22.818
{\an1}Oh, come on.
You didn't tell her.

23:22.901 --> 23:23.944
Yeah, and she dumped me.

23:24.027 --> 23:25.487
Oh. Well...

23:25.570 --> 23:27.447
What did you think she was going
to do, give you a medal?

23:27.531 --> 23:28.824
It was the right thing to do.

23:28.907 --> 23:30.992
We had such
an intense night together,

23:31.076 --> 23:32.994
but it's not
like we had sex or anything,

23:33.078 --> 23:34.663
What did you say?tand.

23:34.746 --> 23:35.831
I'm saying that it was

23:35.914 --> 23:38.333
{\an1}awfully special,
but we didn't really...

23:38.416 --> 23:40.836
{\an1}No, what did you
That we didn't have any.

23:40.919 --> 23:43.130
You told me the other night
that something else went on.

23:43.213 --> 23:44.464
I told you
that we didn't do anything

23:44.548 --> 23:45.841
that you hadn't already done,
like get drunk

23:45.924 --> 23:47.509
and pass out
in the same bed as Donna.

23:47.592 --> 23:49.010
You made me think
something else happened.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.345
{\an1}I didn't make you
think anything.

23:50.428 --> 23:51.471
(snorts)

23:51.555 --> 23:54.516
You know what? You're jealous
of Donna, that's it.

23:54.599 --> 23:57.185
Oh, please, Noah.
We wanted each other, remember?

23:57.269 --> 23:59.980
{\an1}You and me,
that's all that happened.

24:00.063 --> 24:00.981
That's what I felt bad about.

24:01.064 --> 24:01.648
No, you said...

24:01.731 --> 24:03.316
I never said the word "sex."

24:03.400 --> 24:04.526
Did you hear me say "sex"?

24:04.609 --> 24:05.694
{\an1}No.

24:05.777 --> 24:09.239
Where your subconscious desires
take you is your problem.

24:12.576 --> 24:15.162
(sighs)
You got to be kidding me.

24:15.245 --> 24:17.539
Lauren, eat.

24:17.622 --> 24:20.375
Why? So I have the strength to
fight off the men with the nets

24:20.458 --> 24:21.710
when they come to get me?

24:21.793 --> 24:23.378
Don't.

24:23.461 --> 24:24.546
{\an1}Don't what, Matt?
Get upset?

24:24.629 --> 24:25.964
{\an1}Act crazy?

24:26.047 --> 24:27.674
Because that's exactly
what's going to happen

24:27.757 --> 24:29.050
if I go off the Clozapine.

24:29.134 --> 24:31.011
No, see, there must be
something else we can do.

24:31.094 --> 24:31.887
Something that we
haven't tried yet.

24:31.970 --> 24:32.721
But there isn't.

24:32.804 --> 24:34.222
But there has to be, Lauren.

24:36.808 --> 24:38.560
I'm not going to lose you again.

24:38.643 --> 24:40.353
You moved on once.

24:40.437 --> 24:41.563
But I didn't.

24:42.606 --> 24:44.566
Not really.

24:44.649 --> 24:46.776
Then you'll be able to now.

24:46.860 --> 24:49.321
I can't let you die.

24:49.404 --> 24:51.489
(sniffles)

24:51.573 --> 24:53.366
(entry bell rings)

24:53.450 --> 24:56.203
Hey, guys. How was that hotel?
Money well spent?

24:56.286 --> 24:58.038
{\an1}(groans)

24:58.121 --> 25:00.373
Actually, we didn't go.

25:00.457 --> 25:02.209
{\an1}But I really appreciate
your offer.

25:02.292 --> 25:04.294
Excuse me.

25:12.802 --> 25:15.430
(sighs)
You want to talk about that?

25:15.513 --> 25:17.057
It's your call.

25:17.140 --> 25:19.809
I know you're being nice to me
because you lost your wife.

25:19.893 --> 25:21.603
Yes, I did.

25:21.686 --> 25:25.732
And if I had a second chance,
I wouldn't waste it arguing.

25:29.778 --> 25:31.655
The medication is killing her.

25:31.738 --> 25:34.032
So, what happens
if she doesn't take it?

25:34.115 --> 25:36.993
It's a fate worse than death.

25:37.077 --> 25:42.624
Trust me,
there is no such thing.

25:51.341 --> 25:53.885
The poor kid doesn't have a clue
when it comes to women.

25:53.969 --> 25:57.180
You're not getting
close enough.

25:57.264 --> 25:58.682
Where are they, anyway?

25:58.765 --> 26:01.142
{\an1}Well, Marianne's
in the tent reading Kafka

26:01.226 --> 26:05.605
and Stewart's gathering berries
somewhere, probably poisonous.

26:05.689 --> 26:09.150
At the base, Steve, or
it's not gonna catch.

26:09.234 --> 26:10.694
How can you be so
dense sometimes?

26:10.777 --> 26:12.445
Will you cut me some slack?

26:12.529 --> 26:14.489
{\an1}Would it be be such
a gross violation

26:14.572 --> 26:16.658
of the camper's code book
to have brought a lighter?

26:16.741 --> 26:17.742
We're running out of matches.

26:17.826 --> 26:20.161
You know what, Steve?
This trip is about survival.

26:20.245 --> 26:21.830
Because there are
no quick fixes

26:21.913 --> 26:24.457
for kids like Stewart and
Marianne, or for dinner.

26:24.541 --> 26:25.834
Listen to you.

26:25.917 --> 26:27.961
Why don't you go start
a militia group or something?

26:28.044 --> 26:28.837
Ha.

26:28.920 --> 26:29.838
(flame whooshes)

26:29.921 --> 26:32.173
{\an1}Oh, okay, come on. Go get
the last two hot dogs.

26:32.257 --> 26:33.591
Okay.

26:34.551 --> 26:36.553
(thunder rumbles)

26:40.598 --> 26:42.851
That's it.

26:49.899 --> 26:52.110
I got your message
and you're welcome.

26:52.193 --> 26:53.528
Well...

26:53.611 --> 26:55.905
Your gift did the trick.
What can I say?

26:55.989 --> 26:58.074
{\an1}Well, I'm glad one of us
is in the black.

26:58.158 --> 27:00.702
What's your story?

27:00.785 --> 27:01.995
I went to see Matt.

27:02.078 --> 27:06.458
Asked about
their romantic getaway.

27:06.541 --> 27:08.084
I guess it didn't
go as planned.

27:08.168 --> 27:09.544
Well, Matt's got a
lot on his mind.

27:09.627 --> 27:10.795
{\an1}Please.

27:10.879 --> 27:14.049
How hard can it be to make plans
for living happily ever after?

27:14.132 --> 27:15.717
Pretty hard.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.427
When you've only got a week.

27:17.510 --> 27:18.887
What?

27:18.970 --> 27:22.557
The medicine that she
takes is killing her,

27:22.640 --> 27:24.351
so she's going to
quit taking it.

27:24.434 --> 27:29.189
Whatever demons the woman has,
they're going to come back.

27:30.815 --> 27:32.984
{\an1}Hey.

27:33.068 --> 27:34.944
Hi.

27:35.028 --> 27:38.907
{\an1}Uh, can I talk
to you for a second?

27:38.990 --> 27:40.033
Sure. Yeah.

27:40.116 --> 27:42.702
I'll, uh...
see you later.

27:42.786 --> 27:43.828
{\an1}Sorry.

27:47.332 --> 27:48.083
(door closing)

27:48.166 --> 27:49.918
{\an1}Uh, what were you talking
to her about?

27:50.001 --> 27:52.754
Oh, just, you know,
personal stuff.

27:52.837 --> 27:54.547
Personal stuff?

27:56.132 --> 27:57.425
(chuckles)

27:57.509 --> 28:00.136
Obviously,
you're a confidante to Kelly.

28:00.220 --> 28:02.222
Oh, and you're also, um, cupid.

28:02.305 --> 28:03.723
{\an1}Right?
To Matt and Lauren.

28:03.807 --> 28:04.849
{\an1}I mean,
you're just everything

28:04.933 --> 28:07.769
to everybody, aren't you?
Except, of course, to me.

28:07.852 --> 28:10.939
This... is yours.

28:11.022 --> 28:12.482
Get you up in the morning.

28:12.565 --> 28:13.775
(sighs)

28:13.858 --> 28:14.818
{\an1}That really makes me
want to throw up.

28:14.901 --> 28:18.655
You know that? Listen,
if you and your pal Kelly

28:18.738 --> 28:20.615
are blossoming
into something more,

28:20.698 --> 28:22.992
you should just tell me
and I'll take my exit cue.

28:23.076 --> 28:25.245
It's just a note.

28:25.328 --> 28:27.163
That's all it is.

28:27.247 --> 28:30.625
Well, I'm sorry. I...

28:30.708 --> 28:32.544
I technically have never really
had a boyfriend before,

28:32.627 --> 28:35.463
so I don't really know how
to deal with these things,

28:35.547 --> 28:38.383
but I don't think it's supposed
to make me feel like this.

28:38.466 --> 28:40.510
Okay. Come on.

28:40.593 --> 28:42.637
Come on.

28:50.562 --> 28:51.771
{\an1}(sighs)

28:51.855 --> 28:53.481
Kelly bought this for me.

28:53.565 --> 28:54.983
Great.

28:55.066 --> 28:57.819
I think she thinks it will
help me get back on track,

28:57.902 --> 28:58.987
whatever that is.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.321
It's very sweet, Dylan.

29:00.405 --> 29:01.990
Well, I'll tell you
what, it's a great car.

29:02.073 --> 29:03.825
I spent some time
with it yesterday.

29:03.908 --> 29:04.826
It's still a little
rough under the hood.

29:04.909 --> 29:07.162
But, as you can see, the
paint job is beautiful.

29:07.245 --> 29:09.456
I thought we might,
uh, take a drive.

29:09.539 --> 29:11.207
{\an1}Yeah?now?

29:11.291 --> 29:13.126
Yeah. Why not?

29:13.209 --> 29:16.963
{\an1}Go up PCH. Find a place to
maybe break that back seat in.

29:17.046 --> 29:18.339
(clears throat)

29:18.423 --> 29:20.175
You think so?

29:20.258 --> 29:21.092
Maybe kind of walk

29:21.176 --> 29:23.511
along the beach and
find a little spot.

29:23.595 --> 29:27.348
Oh, yeah. Do a little
skinny dipping or something.

29:28.725 --> 29:32.937
I think probably that will
only happen in your dreams.

29:35.190 --> 29:37.192
(tires squeal)

29:45.617 --> 29:47.869
{\an5}DAVID:
<i>After this song, we'll welcome</i>
<i>my special guest,</i>

29:47.952 --> 29:50.538
(slow R&amp;B tune plays)

29:50.622 --> 29:51.915
You're sure you
want to do this?

29:51.998 --> 29:55.668
{\an1}Yeah, yeah. It'll keep
my mind off things.

29:55.752 --> 29:58.087
{\an5}DAVID:
Hey, I can see that.
Well, I'm sure

29:58.171 --> 29:59.714
Noah's gotten the message
you don't want to see him.

29:59.797 --> 30:01.591
I'm not looking for Noah.

30:01.674 --> 30:03.218
Oh.

30:03.301 --> 30:05.220
How about Gina?
She gone into hiding?

30:05.303 --> 30:06.971
She'll surface sooner or later.

30:07.055 --> 30:10.058
Actually, she has to,
because I stole her pager

30:10.141 --> 30:11.851
and without it, her clients
can't reach her. Hmm!

30:11.935 --> 30:13.436
You ready?

30:18.816 --> 30:21.611
Okay. We're going
to the phones.

30:21.694 --> 30:24.864
Stephanie. You there? What's up?

30:24.948 --> 30:26.241
WOMAN (on phone):
Here's the thing.

30:26.324 --> 30:28.117
I bump into my boyfriend
all the time,

30:28.201 --> 30:29.827
and I still get butterflies.

30:29.911 --> 30:31.621
(groans) The worst.

30:31.704 --> 30:34.415
Do either of you have
the same problem with your ex?

30:35.833 --> 30:37.502
Uh, butterflies? No.

30:37.585 --> 30:39.379
No.
(laughs)

30:39.462 --> 30:41.798
You know, Stephanie,
what I've come to realize

30:41.881 --> 30:43.091
is that, uh...

30:43.174 --> 30:45.593
when something's
done, it's-it's done.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.095
Done. Yeah. Over. Finished.

30:47.178 --> 30:48.429
I mean, it's not like

30:48.513 --> 30:50.932
there are any
of those triggers or anything.

30:51.015 --> 30:53.726
You know,
those totally random moments

30:53.810 --> 30:56.980
when you remember
a look or a touch

30:57.063 --> 30:59.941
{\an1}when you first fell
in love with someone.

31:00.024 --> 31:03.570
Then... And then the bad stuff,
that just... Somehow, it...

31:08.032 --> 31:09.242
(whispering):
What was the question?

31:09.325 --> 31:11.035
Oh, I think you covered it.

31:11.119 --> 31:12.662
Right.

31:12.745 --> 31:14.497
(laughing)

31:14.581 --> 31:15.540
We're gonna

31:15.623 --> 31:17.166
take a little break.

31:17.250 --> 31:19.127
(laughing)
Sorry. I spaced there.

31:19.210 --> 31:21.170
Yeah. Where did you go?

31:21.254 --> 31:22.463
It's funny. I actually... I...

31:22.547 --> 31:24.257
I went back
to this time in high school

31:24.340 --> 31:25.508
when we were doing our show.

31:25.592 --> 31:28.344
And remember? I hyperventilated
while we were doing the news?

31:28.428 --> 31:29.679
And everybody thought
that you and I...

31:29.762 --> 31:31.347
Yeah, on air.

31:31.431 --> 31:32.640
(laughs)

31:32.724 --> 31:34.017
Yeah.
I remember you were horrified.

31:34.100 --> 31:34.976
And I remember

31:35.059 --> 31:37.312
that you couldn't have been
more protective.

31:47.780 --> 31:50.158
I'm sorry, folks.
I just... I got an idea.

31:50.241 --> 31:54.829
A... A theme for the night,
if you will.

31:54.912 --> 31:56.831
Can ex-lovers...

31:56.914 --> 31:59.125
remain friends?

31:59.208 --> 32:01.502
I think you're listening
to living proof.

32:01.586 --> 32:03.504
What do you think?
Give us

32:03.588 --> 32:04.631
a call.

32:10.303 --> 32:12.055
(thunder rumbles)

32:20.938 --> 32:22.857
(groaning)

32:22.940 --> 32:24.108
Whoo.

32:25.443 --> 32:27.153
Stewart and Marianne
are out cold.

32:27.236 --> 32:29.197
Sleeping in separate beds,
mind you.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.198
Good.

32:30.281 --> 32:31.324
What about you?

32:31.407 --> 32:33.159
You going to sleep out here?
'Cause the kids and I,

32:33.242 --> 32:36.412
we made this really cool
sleeping bag pillow fort.

32:36.496 --> 32:37.997
You could sleep in
there, if you want.

32:38.081 --> 32:39.707
Um...leep on the floor.

32:39.791 --> 32:43.211
Why don't you go
ahead and go in?

32:43.294 --> 32:45.588
You know, they really
shouldn't be left alone.

32:45.672 --> 32:47.090
And I-I'll be in in a minute.

32:47.173 --> 32:49.092
You're mad at me.

32:49.175 --> 32:50.385
What did I do this time?

32:50.468 --> 32:52.053
You gave up on this weekend.

32:52.136 --> 32:54.514
I didn't give up.
I'm still here.

32:54.597 --> 32:57.392
At a motel, Steve.

32:57.475 --> 32:58.559
I mean, you

32:58.643 --> 33:00.353
always take the easy way out.

33:00.436 --> 33:02.105
This was not my idea.

33:02.188 --> 33:03.272
No kidding, no kidding.

33:03.356 --> 33:04.565
It was my idea.

33:05.775 --> 33:07.527
It was my chance to get
out of town

33:07.610 --> 33:09.904
a-and out of the office
and away from you.

33:11.864 --> 33:15.368
Man, you can be so harsh.

33:15.451 --> 33:17.745
Yeah, well, sometimes
a girl kind of has to be.

33:17.829 --> 33:20.415
Janet, you're driving me crazy.

33:20.498 --> 33:22.041
How am I supposed
to get over you

33:22.125 --> 33:23.209
when you're always in my face?

33:29.215 --> 33:31.300
Did I just say
that last part out loud?

33:36.681 --> 33:40.101
(thunder rumbling)

33:40.184 --> 33:43.604
So, um, sleeping bag pillow
fort-- that's-that's good.

33:43.688 --> 33:45.231
That-That wins points.

33:45.314 --> 33:47.275
Yeah, it was fun.

33:49.402 --> 33:51.988
You're really good
with those kids.

33:52.071 --> 33:53.781
Thanks.

33:55.408 --> 33:57.285
By the way, uh...

34:00.246 --> 34:01.539
By the way,

34:01.622 --> 34:04.542
the reason I'm always
in your face--

34:04.625 --> 34:06.544
is 'cause I really like it.

34:25.730 --> 34:26.313
Hey.

34:26.397 --> 34:27.607
You got my
messages, right?

34:27.690 --> 34:29.275
Yep. I didn't listen
to any of them.

34:29.358 --> 34:31.152
{\an1}Gina and I had a little
misunderstanding.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.652
Oh, what? A lovers' quarrel.

34:32.737 --> 34:35.364
What a shame. Listen,
I found a pair of your jeans.

34:35.447 --> 34:37.033
Whatever you
have of mine,

34:37.116 --> 34:38.993
just give it to Steve
and he can drop it off.

34:39.076 --> 34:42.288
{\an1}Gina and I did
not sleep together.

34:42.371 --> 34:43.664
Yeah, that's believable.

34:43.748 --> 34:45.541
Well, it's true. Just ask her.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.335
Ask who? Ask Gina?

34:47.418 --> 34:49.128
Ask Gina for
the truth? Please.

34:49.212 --> 34:51.380
Okay, I'm telling you,
nothing happened.

34:51.464 --> 34:53.674
Great. And I'm telling
you I don't care.

34:53.757 --> 34:54.842
How can you say that?

34:54.926 --> 34:56.010
You know why?

34:56.094 --> 34:58.679
Because what you and Gina
actually did doesn't matter.

34:58.763 --> 35:00.556
It's what I believed
that you did.

35:00.640 --> 35:02.141
Okay, but we didn't do anything.

35:02.225 --> 35:04.644
I wish I could believe that.

35:04.727 --> 35:06.604
I really do.

35:10.107 --> 35:12.652
(door closing)

35:18.825 --> 35:20.201
Hmm, if I'd have known

35:20.284 --> 35:22.787
{\an1}we were going to sleep
in this car... oh...

35:25.123 --> 35:26.999
I have to go check
on the kids.

35:27.083 --> 35:28.084
Why? It's still early.

35:28.167 --> 35:31.128
You know the drill-- get up,
get dressed, repress.

35:31.212 --> 35:32.547
No, I don't want to.

35:32.630 --> 35:34.423
Listen, about this weekend...

35:34.507 --> 35:35.550
It was a blast.

35:35.633 --> 35:37.385
Oh, it was a blast.

35:37.468 --> 35:38.761
And when we get home...

35:38.845 --> 35:40.763
I want us to be a couple.

35:43.599 --> 35:44.517
Uh-huh.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.018
We weren't ready before.

35:46.102 --> 35:47.144
But we're ready now.

35:47.228 --> 35:49.146
I wonder if this place has
a complimentary breakfast.

35:55.653 --> 35:57.655
(tapping)

36:00.908 --> 36:02.952
NiThank you.k.

36:03.035 --> 36:05.413
Just wanted to let you know,
uh, this weekend was a ball.

36:05.496 --> 36:09.292
{\an1}Um, w-we'll be out
in just one sec.

36:09.375 --> 36:11.586
Looks like someone got busy.

36:11.669 --> 36:13.004
It's about time.

36:26.183 --> 36:27.476
Hi.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.437
{\an1}If this is going
to be an argument, I...

36:29.520 --> 36:31.606
No, it's not.

36:31.689 --> 36:32.773
Can I sit down?

36:32.857 --> 36:34.400
Of course.

36:38.863 --> 36:42.199
I have been incredibly selfish.

36:42.283 --> 36:44.118
No, you haven't.

36:44.201 --> 36:47.788
Still, I'm sorry--

36:47.872 --> 36:49.624
for everything.

36:49.707 --> 36:51.626
I appreciate that.

36:51.709 --> 36:55.296
Dylan told me about Lauren.

36:55.379 --> 36:59.300
Good news travels
fast around here.

36:59.383 --> 37:02.053
Please let me be a friend.

37:03.804 --> 37:08.100
One percent of the population
has schizophrenia.

37:08.184 --> 37:12.647
Two percent of that one percent
has a potentially fatal reaction

37:12.730 --> 37:14.482
to Clozapine.

37:14.565 --> 37:16.275
That's pretty good odds, right?

37:16.359 --> 37:18.277
Don't do this to yourself.

37:18.361 --> 37:21.614
I guess in the great big
statistical scheme of things

37:21.697 --> 37:23.491
Lauren got the shaft.

37:23.574 --> 37:25.534
Twice.

37:28.245 --> 37:31.582
If there's anything I can do.

37:37.755 --> 37:39.423
You're already doing it.

37:46.138 --> 37:48.432
(alarm chirping)

37:54.605 --> 37:57.149
Let's have a little
chat, shall we?

37:57.233 --> 37:59.485
Oh, that whole thing
between me and Noah

37:59.568 --> 38:00.820
was a total misunderstanding.

38:00.903 --> 38:02.822
Oh, good. So you talked to him.

38:02.905 --> 38:04.865
You know what I say?

38:04.949 --> 38:06.867
You misled him on purpose.

38:06.951 --> 38:09.161
WTo hurt me, Gina.t?

38:09.245 --> 38:12.039
Donna, come on. Noah's had it
out for me since day one.

38:12.123 --> 38:13.290
Really?

38:13.374 --> 38:15.501
So why don't you tell me what
really happened that night?

38:15.584 --> 38:16.377
He came on to me.

38:16.460 --> 38:18.838
Enough with your lies!
What happened?!

38:18.921 --> 38:21.382
Absolutely nothing happened.

38:21.465 --> 38:22.675
{\an1}Okay?

38:25.261 --> 38:27.888
To think all these years
I was taught to pity you.

38:27.972 --> 38:29.890
You lying bitch.

38:29.974 --> 38:30.891
What?

38:30.975 --> 38:33.394
You're nothing but trash.

38:37.815 --> 38:38.899
(door closes)

38:52.663 --> 38:54.582
Hi..

38:57.043 --> 38:59.211
It's nice, huh?

38:59.295 --> 39:00.671
{\an1}MATT:
Yeah.

39:00.755 --> 39:03.215
It's so simple--
the sky and stars.

39:03.299 --> 39:04.592
Uncomplicated.

39:08.721 --> 39:11.098
I'm so tired, Matt.

39:11.182 --> 39:13.309
All this anger and frustration
inside of me.

39:13.392 --> 39:16.228
Then you should let it go.

39:17.563 --> 39:19.440
You know, I only have
three pills left.

39:19.523 --> 39:23.444
{\an1}After that, no doctor's going
to give me a prescription.

39:23.527 --> 39:27.156
Then we find a way to get you
what you need without a doctor.

39:28.657 --> 39:30.409
Really?

39:31.535 --> 39:33.162
How?

39:33.245 --> 39:35.664
I don't know.

39:36.999 --> 39:39.502
But after we do,
we're getting out of here.

39:45.174 --> 39:46.592
We're going to Venice?

39:46.675 --> 39:48.803
It'll be like
a second honeymoon.

39:48.886 --> 39:50.304
Got a brand-new credit card
and everything.

39:50.387 --> 39:51.722
Can we afford that?

39:51.806 --> 39:54.225
No.

39:56.894 --> 39:58.729
I love you so much.

40:02.358 --> 40:04.360
I love you, too.

40:08.656 --> 40:11.117
No, it was third grade. A-3.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.827
Right, right.

40:12.910 --> 40:14.578
Oh, yeah, that was
a hit, by the way.

40:14.662 --> 40:19.583
Uh... Mr... uh, Mr. Bodfish--
benched me for a week, right.

40:19.667 --> 40:20.876
Miss.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.419
Should have been more
like a month.

40:22.503 --> 40:24.004
Wait, for what, gum?

40:24.088 --> 40:24.672
Come on.

40:24.755 --> 40:25.965
In my hair.

40:26.048 --> 40:27.842
Totally ruining my
Dorothy Hamill wedge cut,

40:27.925 --> 40:29.552
thank you very much,
right before

40:29.635 --> 40:30.886
yearbook pictures.

40:30.970 --> 40:33.389
Come on, I did you a favor.

40:33.472 --> 40:35.474
Have you talked to Matt?

40:35.558 --> 40:37.518
Mmm, briefly.

40:37.601 --> 40:41.897
Enough to let him know that
I'm here if he needs me.

40:41.981 --> 40:43.899
Hmm, ah, he's a lucky man.

40:43.983 --> 40:46.318
Where's Gina?

40:46.402 --> 40:47.862
I don't know.
She, uh...

40:47.945 --> 40:51.866
had to take a break
from me for awhile.

40:51.949 --> 40:53.742
She'll be back.

40:53.826 --> 40:55.661
Whatever.

40:55.744 --> 40:57.705
Never really seemed
to bother you.

40:57.788 --> 41:01.667
I mean, we would be playing
on the playground,

41:01.750 --> 41:04.378
{\an1}and then you
would just stop.

41:04.461 --> 41:08.841
And I could never tell if you
were happy or you were sad.

41:08.924 --> 41:10.509
I just didn't care.

41:10.593 --> 41:14.096
An existentialist at eight.

41:15.681 --> 41:17.016
A-2.

41:17.099 --> 41:19.852
You sank my destroyer.

41:19.935 --> 41:21.604
You'll get over it.

41:21.687 --> 41:23.898
You always do.

41:23.981 --> 41:26.233
I don't know,
it's doubtful.

41:26.317 --> 41:28.819
I feel like sometimes I'm just
going in slow motion--

41:28.903 --> 41:31.655
the rest of the world is
going full speed.

41:31.739 --> 41:36.202
So I just reach out grabbing
for, you know, something.

41:36.285 --> 41:37.912
Anything.

41:37.995 --> 41:39.955
Europe, heroin,

41:40.039 --> 41:41.707
Gina.

41:41.790 --> 41:44.084
Doesn't matter what I grab.

41:44.168 --> 41:46.378
I still end up lost.

41:48.339 --> 41:49.924
Focus.

41:50.007 --> 41:52.718
That's what we need.

41:52.801 --> 41:54.762
I'm not good at it.

41:56.889 --> 41:59.600
Look, I've only ever connected
with two things in this life.

41:59.683 --> 42:00.935
One of them is dead.

42:01.018 --> 42:02.728
How about the other one?

42:04.688 --> 42:07.524
She's sitting
right across from me.

42:17.993 --> 42:20.579
NEWSCASTER:
Mostly su(knocking)today...

42:28.671 --> 42:29.922
Hi.

42:30.005 --> 42:30.965
Hey.

42:31.048 --> 42:32.299
Sorry I didn't call.

42:32.383 --> 42:35.594
Um... how's it going?

42:35.678 --> 42:37.972
Okay.

42:38.055 --> 42:39.974
How you doing?

42:40.057 --> 42:41.934
Fine.

42:42.017 --> 42:43.978
Good.

42:44.061 --> 42:47.189
At least that's what
I keep telling myself.

42:47.273 --> 42:49.525
That's good.

42:52.444 --> 42:53.946
(sighs)

42:54.029 --> 42:55.322
Something wrong?

42:55.406 --> 42:57.658
No. Um...

42:59.618 --> 43:01.495
{\an1}Remember what I said
on the radio

43:01.578 --> 43:05.374
{\an1}about how ex-lovers
can be friends?

43:05.457 --> 43:06.917
Mm-hmm.

43:08.919 --> 43:10.671
I lied.
