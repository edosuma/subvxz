00:05.774 --> 00:09.403
<i>Again and again till l get it right</i>

00:09.454 --> 00:13.049
<i>Nobody's perfect</i>
<i>you live and you learn it</i>

00:13.094 --> 00:16.609
<i>'cause everybody makes mistakes</i>

00:16.654 --> 00:18.406
<i>Nobody's perfect</i>

00:18.454 --> 00:21.969
<i>Nobody's perfect</i>

00:22.014 --> 00:26.292
<i>No, no</i>
<i>nobody's perfect</i>

00:27.654 --> 00:29.724
<i>Thank you! You guys rock!</i>

00:31.134 --> 00:33.364
<i>Keep on listening,</i>
<i>and l'll see you guys when l get back</i>

00:33.414 --> 00:36.929
<i>from my very first European tour!</i>

00:37.974 --> 00:39.646
<i>l know! l can't wait.</i>

00:39.694 --> 00:43.926
<i>Swiss chocolate, ltalian shoes</i>
<i>and French boys!</i>

00:47.854 --> 00:51.244
The closest she's coming to Paris
is Paris, Texas.

00:51.974 --> 00:55.205
<i>Thank you, guys!</i>
<i>l'll see you all next time. Bye!</i>

01:03.294 --> 01:04.772
Nailed it!

01:05.294 --> 01:07.250
And now,

01:07.294 --> 01:09.364
for the main event,

01:10.014 --> 01:13.324
the big toe!

01:19.654 --> 01:22.452
Dang it, Jackson, l hate toenail day!

01:23.014 --> 01:25.733
Hey, l put a note on the refrigerator.

01:25.774 --> 01:27.890
lf you choose not to wear
your protective goggles,

01:27.934 --> 01:30.129
l can't be held responsible.

01:30.654 --> 01:33.930
Well, here's something
you can be held responsible for.

01:33.974 --> 01:36.169
Looks like this letter's from your school.

01:36.214 --> 01:37.567
Oh, man.

01:38.214 --> 01:39.408
Oh, boy.

01:39.454 --> 01:42.287
Did l tell you
how great your hair looks?

01:43.454 --> 01:45.126
lt's like a field of wheat.

01:45.174 --> 01:47.369
How do you keep it so lush?

01:48.934 --> 01:50.686
lt's about Miley.

01:51.134 --> 01:52.647
And l use a volumising mousse,

01:52.694 --> 01:54.571
but just a little dab,
right here in the palm.

01:54.614 --> 01:57.447
Sorry, Dad. l only care if l'm in trouble.

01:58.454 --> 02:02.242
<i>London, England, Paris, France</i>
<i>Watch me do the Europe dance</i>

02:02.294 --> 02:05.923
<i>Europe, Europe, Europe</i>
<i>We're all going to Europe</i>

02:06.454 --> 02:09.412
Yeah, about that.
l just got this letter from school...

02:09.454 --> 02:11.888
And somebody's grades
are slipping again?

02:11.934 --> 02:14.926
Jackson, Jackson, Jackson.
What are we going to do with you, boy?

02:14.974 --> 02:18.444
-Miles, you...
-No, son, let her go on.

02:18.494 --> 02:20.450
How would you handle this, Miley?

02:20.494 --> 02:24.612
Well, as much as it pains me,

02:25.454 --> 02:28.526
l'd have to say, no grades, no Europe.

02:28.574 --> 02:29.927
l'm gonna miss you, buddy.

02:31.974 --> 02:34.568
Then again, what do l know?
l'm just a kid!

02:34.614 --> 02:37.333
Have l told you
your hair looks great today?

02:38.134 --> 02:41.126
l already tried field-of-wheat.
Good luck.

02:42.334 --> 02:43.653
So lush.

<i>And you know that</i>
<i>it's the best of both worlds</i>

03:41.454 --> 03:43.763
How could your dad
cancel the European tour

03:43.814 --> 03:45.645
just because of one bad grade?

03:45.694 --> 03:47.685
Well, l'm guessing
it went something like,

03:47.734 --> 03:50.202
''Bud, you're not going,''

03:50.254 --> 03:52.085
and then something
about your Uncle Earl's feet.

03:53.414 --> 03:55.484
That's so weird. lt's like you were there.

03:56.654 --> 03:57.882
Look at this.

03:57.934 --> 04:01.768
English muffins, ltalian sausages,
Swiss cheese.

04:01.814 --> 04:04.044
Why are you all taunting me?

04:06.414 --> 04:07.767
Sorry.
A little cranky, skipped breakfast.

04:07.814 --> 04:09.486
Most important meal of the day.
Carry on.

04:09.534 --> 04:11.570
Man, your dad's being so unfair!

04:11.614 --> 04:14.367
l already bought this beret.
See? So cute!

04:15.734 --> 04:18.327
Listen, guys, it's not my dad's fault.
We had a deal.

04:18.374 --> 04:21.889
School always comes first,
and if l can't get at least a B in biology,

04:21.934 --> 04:24.892
the closest we're going to get to Paris
is French toast.

04:26.294 --> 04:27.613
Hold up, people.

04:27.654 --> 04:30.726
lf you need a B, all you have to do
is ace the midterm tomorrow.

04:31.454 --> 04:35.049
How did she miss that?
No wonder she's flunking biology.

04:36.814 --> 04:37.883
lf l could ace the midterm,

04:37.934 --> 04:39.333
l wouldn't have a problem,
now would l?

04:39.374 --> 04:42.446
And if l stay friends with you,
l'll never have chest hair, will l?

04:45.454 --> 04:47.968
So just come on over to my house
after school.

04:48.014 --> 04:50.733
l'd be more than happy
to help you with your Spanish.

04:55.294 --> 04:56.522
What does that mean?

04:57.694 --> 04:59.650
lt means we have a lot of work to do.

04:59.694 --> 05:02.766
Thanks so much, Jackson.
l really appreciate it.

05:02.854 --> 05:05.448
l really, really appreciate it.

05:06.054 --> 05:08.932
-No problemo.
-Problemo.

05:09.374 --> 05:10.966
Wait, l know this one!

05:15.694 --> 05:18.891
-Okay, we'll just go over it later.
-l can't wait.

05:21.774 --> 05:24.686
-Hey, Thor, what's up?
-Jackson, it's old Snowball.

05:24.734 --> 05:26.531
The landlord says
we got to get rid of him,

05:26.574 --> 05:29.008
and how can l do that?
l love him so much.

05:29.054 --> 05:31.522
l mean old Snowball, not the landlord.
Although he seems very nice.

05:31.574 --> 05:33.565
-l need a hug!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

05:33.614 --> 05:35.605
Dude, in California,

05:35.654 --> 05:37.849
when a guy says, ''What's up?''
the other guy says, ''Not much.''

05:37.894 --> 05:39.168
And then we move on.

05:40.094 --> 05:42.005
Thor, you dumb bunny.

05:42.734 --> 05:44.565
-Okay, let's try it again.
-Okay, good.

05:45.094 --> 05:47.210
-Hey, Thor, what's up?
-Jackson, the landlord says...

05:47.254 --> 05:50.166
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Dude! We also don't hug.

05:51.014 --> 05:53.528
We occasionally slap butts,
but only on the football field.

05:55.454 --> 05:57.331
l owe the janitor an apology.

05:58.734 --> 06:00.804
Look, man, if you need a place
to park the old guy,

06:00.854 --> 06:02.048
he can stay at my house.

06:02.094 --> 06:04.403
Snowball, you hear that?
We found you a home!

06:04.534 --> 06:05.649
Come on, boy!

06:06.374 --> 06:08.205
What, you brought your dog to school?

06:08.254 --> 06:09.926
Snowball's not a dog.

06:14.854 --> 06:18.403
Or a cow. Stop showing off.
You're not fooling anyone.

06:22.414 --> 06:23.483
Miley, we've got the plan.

06:23.534 --> 06:25.126
But if you don't like it,
it was all her idea.

06:26.494 --> 06:28.371
-Way to sell it, Oliver.
-Sorry.

06:28.414 --> 06:31.247
l only have one chest hair,
and l need it for gym class.

06:32.974 --> 06:35.613
Just ask the smartest kid in class
to tutor you.

06:35.654 --> 06:38.214
Are you kidding?
The smartest kid in class is...

06:38.254 --> 06:40.404
-How can you not get this?
-l'm sorry.

06:40.454 --> 06:43.173
lt's just your data suggests
1 0% of human genes

06:43.214 --> 06:46.126
vary in the number of copies
of specific DNA segments.

06:46.174 --> 06:49.484
Exactly! This isn't brain surgery!

06:51.054 --> 06:53.363
Are you serious?
You want me to ask Rico?

06:53.414 --> 06:55.609
Come on, you guys, it's not like
he's the only kid with a brain

06:55.654 --> 06:56.723
in this class.

07:00.334 --> 07:01.403
Okay, fine.

07:04.414 --> 07:07.963
-Oh, Rico.
-Hey, bubble brain. How's it going?

07:09.534 --> 07:11.604
Smart, funny and...

07:11.654 --> 07:13.565
And dead-on about that bubble brain.

07:15.814 --> 07:19.124
But just in biology. Other than that,
you're as sharp as a tick.

07:19.934 --> 07:21.413
-That's ''tack.''
-You see?

07:24.254 --> 07:26.404
Good thing you two are pretty.

07:26.894 --> 07:30.409
Okay. l'm just going
to come right out and ask you.

07:30.454 --> 07:32.922
-You need help in biology.
-How'd you know that?

07:33.214 --> 07:37.048
Please. Put together the grades
from your last four quizzes,

07:37.094 --> 07:39.733
and they spell Duh-Duh-Duh-F.

07:41.374 --> 07:44.207
One of those was a Duh-Duh-Duh-plus.

07:44.894 --> 07:48.967
Whatever. l'll help you,
if you help me in another class.

07:50.374 --> 07:53.446
How about them apples?
The genius needs my help.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.169
So, what can l do for you?

08:01.094 --> 08:02.129
Higher.

08:03.694 --> 08:04.729
Higher.

08:05.694 --> 08:07.093
No, no, sorry. Lower.

08:08.214 --> 08:10.853
-Yeah. That's good.
-Rico, that's where l started.

08:10.894 --> 08:13.169
l've been standing like this
for two hours.

08:15.134 --> 08:16.453
My neck is cramping.

08:16.894 --> 08:18.646
And this wig is really heavy!

08:20.294 --> 08:23.730
Don't worry about it.
My masterpiece is complete.

08:27.574 --> 08:28.802
All right.

08:30.974 --> 08:32.645
Finally. Now...

08:33.333 --> 08:35.928
-What's this?
-An A-plus.

08:36.974 --> 08:39.966
-What was l here for?
-l needed someone to hold the globe.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.525
What about this stupid outfit?

08:43.094 --> 08:45.733
That was just
a little something for Rico.

08:47.574 --> 08:51.169
l'm gonna give Rico a little something
if you don't teach me some biology.

08:51.214 --> 08:52.806
Okay, okay. Fine.

08:52.854 --> 08:54.651
l'll give you the secret to my success.

08:55.094 --> 08:58.086
-But share this with no one.
-Yeah, sure, whatever, teach me.

08:59.894 --> 09:02.089
-Okay.
-Okay. Open the book.

09:03.454 --> 09:05.524
-Check.
-Look at the page.

09:07.054 --> 09:08.123
Check.

09:08.654 --> 09:10.610
-Close the book.
-What?

09:10.854 --> 09:12.970
That's it! Good luck on the test.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.409
You didn't teach me anything.

09:16.454 --> 09:19.332
Don't you have a photographic memory
like me?

09:19.374 --> 09:20.443
No.

09:20.734 --> 09:22.565
Then you're on your own, toots.

09:22.614 --> 09:24.491
Wait a minute! Come back here!

09:29.974 --> 09:31.168
Okay.

09:32.134 --> 09:34.204
Not again!

09:38.134 --> 09:41.490
At bedtime, he loves it
when you read <i>Goodnight Moon.</i>

09:42.334 --> 09:44.370
But don't show him
where the mouse is,

09:44.414 --> 09:45.767
just let him find it.

09:46.694 --> 09:47.968
Dude, l got it.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.246
Now if you don't mind, l've got myself
a little study date with Becky, so...

09:51.294 --> 09:53.410
You mean Becky with the bad breath?

09:53.454 --> 09:54.728
No, not her.

09:54.774 --> 09:57.846
You mean bucktooth Becky,
the human bottle-opener.

09:57.894 --> 09:59.009
She scares me.

09:59.374 --> 10:01.490
Although she did come in handy
on that field trip.

10:01.774 --> 10:05.084
No, no, no. Becky from Spanish class.

10:06.574 --> 10:11.694
-You mean brainless Becky.
-Yeah. Brainless, bodacious Becky.

10:17.814 --> 10:19.042
What?

10:20.694 --> 10:21.843
l'll be right there!

10:21.894 --> 10:23.247
-Use the back door.
-Okay.

10:24.614 --> 10:26.411
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.125
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

10:29.174 --> 10:31.324
Dude, just get out of here already!

10:31.854 --> 10:34.493
lf he gets too cold,
here's his little parka,

10:34.534 --> 10:36.047
but don't zip it up.

10:36.614 --> 10:38.411
He likes to do it himself.

10:43.974 --> 10:46.488
Likes to zip it himself. Right.

10:57.374 --> 11:00.844
You're such a good teacher.
l just have one question.

11:00.894 --> 11:04.045
How do you say ''kiss me'' in Spanish?

11:04.454 --> 11:05.682
That's easy. That's...

11:09.614 --> 11:11.730
-Bucktooth Becky.
-What?

11:12.654 --> 11:14.884
-Just ignore him.
-Okay.

11:14.934 --> 11:16.572
Becky with the bad breath.

11:17.174 --> 11:18.368
Why is he saying that?

11:18.414 --> 11:20.882
He's a bird.
He just repeats what he hears.

11:22.374 --> 11:23.443
Shut up!

11:24.134 --> 11:25.613
Well, so where'd he hear it?

11:26.294 --> 11:29.092
-Brainless Becky. Brainless Becky.
-What?

11:29.134 --> 11:31.250
No, no, l... l didn't say that.

11:31.294 --> 11:34.525
l said, ''Brainless, bodacious Becky.''

11:35.934 --> 11:38.368
-Excuse me?
-Bye-bye.

11:38.414 --> 11:43.124
-Bye-bye is right. You blew it, jerk.
-No, wait! You don't understand!

11:43.174 --> 11:45.893
''Bodacious'' is Spanish for ''smart.''

11:45.934 --> 11:48.448
From the Latin root braindacious.

11:53.334 --> 11:56.326
<i>l want my mullet back</i>

11:57.174 --> 12:00.291
<i>My messy cage and my 8-track</i>

12:01.294 --> 12:05.173
<i>My swinging perch and my water bowl</i>

12:05.214 --> 12:08.650
<i>Now Rob and Snowball</i>
<i>gonna rock and roll</i>

12:09.614 --> 12:12.174
Dad! Could you keep it down in there?
l'm trying to study.

12:12.214 --> 12:13.249
l'm sorry, honey.

12:13.454 --> 12:16.571
All right, Snowball, we gonna take five,
but when l get back,

12:16.614 --> 12:19.003
l'm teaching you <i>Wanna Be Your Joe.</i>

12:19.054 --> 12:21.693
-Robby rocks.
-And don't you forget it.

12:22.494 --> 12:24.212
l love that bird.

12:24.894 --> 12:27.727
Ribs attach to sacrum... No, no, no.

12:27.774 --> 12:31.210
Sternum, which attaches to a bone
that ends in ''illa'' or...

12:31.254 --> 12:33.814
Or ''uno'' or ''Oprah.''

12:33.854 --> 12:35.651
Yeah, that's it, it's my Oprah,

12:35.694 --> 12:38.083
and l'm a doprah
who's never going to Europa!

12:39.974 --> 12:41.726
Now hang in there, honey. You'll get it.

12:41.774 --> 12:44.811
No, l won't.
The biology midterm's tomorrow.

12:45.294 --> 12:49.890
There's 206 bones in the human body.
lt's not like l can learn them like

12:49.934 --> 12:51.652
some new Hannah dance.

12:51.694 --> 12:53.366
Yeah, you do pick up on those
pretty fast.

12:53.414 --> 12:54.893
Yeah, that's 'cause it's fun.

12:54.934 --> 12:57.494
-Trust me, biology ain't.
-lsn't.

12:57.694 --> 13:00.162
l'm getting a B in English, Dad,
that's not the problem.

13:00.214 --> 13:02.682
The problem is, is my biology teacher

13:02.734 --> 13:04.611
doesn't stand
in front of the class going...

13:04.654 --> 13:07.088
<i>Tibia, fibula, clavicle, rib</i>

13:07.134 --> 13:09.648
<i>We call this the humerus</i>
<i>and that's no fib</i>

13:09.694 --> 13:12.686
-Why can't it be that easy?
-That's a good question.

13:14.694 --> 13:16.127
-l thought of it first!
-l thought of it first!

13:16.174 --> 13:17.368
-No, you didn't!
-No, you didn't!

13:17.414 --> 13:18.813
-Yes, l did.
-Didn't.

13:18.854 --> 13:20.003
-Did!
-Didn't!

13:20.414 --> 13:22.245
Yes, he did. Yes, he did.

13:22.974 --> 13:25.363
Like l said, l love that bird.

13:30.614 --> 13:34.050
<i>And now l take it home</i>
<i>with the parietal bone</i>

13:34.094 --> 13:37.450
<i>lt might be crazy</i>
<i>but l learn that way</i>

13:37.494 --> 13:40.850
<i>Temporal and frontal, too</i>
<i>and now l'm finally through</i>

13:40.894 --> 13:44.250
<i>That make 206</i>
<i>l found a way that clicks</i>

13:45.094 --> 13:47.562
<i>We're going to England</i>
<i>We're going to France</i>

13:47.614 --> 13:48.888
<i>We're going to Europe</i>

13:48.934 --> 13:52.210
<i>Because she learned</i>
<i>how to memorise all the stuff</i>

13:52.774 --> 13:54.207
<i>Now word</i>

13:57.214 --> 14:01.207
Bodacious Becky. Bodacious Becky.
Bodacious Becky.

14:01.934 --> 14:05.529
This is exactly why you're going back
to Thor's, you stupid birdbrain!

14:05.574 --> 14:07.530
-Morning, Stewart.
-Stupid birdbrain.

14:07.574 --> 14:09.610
Detention, Stewart.

14:09.654 --> 14:11.372
lt wasn't even me, it was...

14:13.334 --> 14:14.403
You know what?

14:14.454 --> 14:15.773
Why don't you just drop dead?

14:17.814 --> 14:20.089
Oh, no! What did l do?

14:20.854 --> 14:21.969
Come on, buddy.

14:22.574 --> 14:25.611
Speak to me. Say something. Anything!

14:26.454 --> 14:28.285
Becky has bad breath?

14:28.334 --> 14:31.246
l was going to give you
another chance, you jerk!

14:31.294 --> 14:34.684
Oh, no, no! No, wake up!
Come back to me, man.

14:34.734 --> 14:36.531
Don't fly into the light!

14:40.454 --> 14:41.569
Hey, buddy.

14:42.534 --> 14:44.650
What's Snowball's cage doing here?

14:46.654 --> 14:48.485
l brought him to school

14:48.894 --> 14:52.091
'cause l've just grown so fond of him.

14:53.374 --> 14:55.763
-You got him in there?
-Yeah.

14:57.094 --> 14:58.163
He was cold.

14:59.534 --> 15:01.365
How you doing in there, buddy?

15:01.654 --> 15:02.928
Great. Bye.

15:10.214 --> 15:11.283
Okay.

15:11.814 --> 15:14.533
l was going to bring him back to you
'cause he ruined my date,

15:14.574 --> 15:16.724
and then he got me detention,
but then l yelled at him,

15:16.774 --> 15:19.766
and then the next thing l knew
it was bye-bye, birdie.

15:21.494 --> 15:23.689
You're playing dead again, aren't you?

15:23.734 --> 15:26.123
Aren't you, you silly little bird?

15:27.134 --> 15:28.169
Ta-da.

15:30.254 --> 15:33.007
Sweet niblets,
l've been punk'd by a parrot.

15:33.854 --> 15:35.128
Who does Daddy love?

15:35.534 --> 15:37.365
-Snowball!
-Yes, l do.

15:38.934 --> 15:41.892
All right, class.
Eyes on your own paper.

15:42.134 --> 15:43.169
No talking.

15:43.694 --> 15:44.763
-Oken?
-Yes, ma'am.

15:44.814 --> 15:46.167
-l said no talking!
-Right!

15:47.974 --> 15:50.249
You have 4 <i>5</i> minutes.
Good luck, everyone.

15:50.774 --> 15:51.843
Done!

15:52.374 --> 15:53.773
Here you go, teach.

15:54.934 --> 15:58.893
Sorry l took so long, l just wanted
to double-check my answers.

16:00.494 --> 16:03.406
Don't worry, lollipop.
You can always marry money.

16:11.214 --> 16:14.763
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>
<i>Question number one.</i>

16:14.814 --> 16:18.284
<i>''Name the three bones</i>
<i>that make up the arm. ''</i>

16:18.334 --> 16:23.362
<i>All right, that's the humerus,</i>
<i>the radius and the...</i>

16:25.374 --> 16:28.491
<i>Hey, no problem, Miley,</i>
<i>just dance it out.</i>

16:28.814 --> 16:32.204
<i>When l milk the cows</i>
<i>on Uncle Earl's farm</i>

16:32.254 --> 16:35.883
<i>l use the ulna bone</i>
<i>that is in my arm</i>

16:35.934 --> 16:38.289
Moo-ya!

16:38.334 --> 16:42.327
Stewart, are you sending signals?
l won't have cheating in my class!

16:42.374 --> 16:44.365
l'm not cheating.
Really, l'm just taking the test.

16:44.414 --> 16:46.450
Well, then take it without all this.

16:47.894 --> 16:51.250
-But l...
-Will be glad to, Miss Kunkle.

16:51.534 --> 16:53.445
Took the words right out of your mouth,
didn't l?

16:53.494 --> 16:54.643
Yes, ma'am.

16:54.694 --> 16:58.289
Yanked them out like a hungry raccoon
in a doughnut shop Dumpster.

16:59.614 --> 17:02.686
A lot of people must find
those country sayings charming.

17:03.694 --> 17:06.731
l'm from Detroit.
We don't find anything charming.

17:08.614 --> 17:09.967
Now sit still.

17:29.134 --> 17:30.169
<i>l'm dead.</i>

17:32.574 --> 17:35.372
There. See what you can do about that.

17:39.134 --> 17:41.204
The Karkovski Entrapment.

17:41.854 --> 17:43.526
Clever, Rico.

17:43.574 --> 17:47.726
But not clever enough
when you're dealing with Rico!

17:50.214 --> 17:54.207
Miss Kunkle, could you please ask
the Rico twins to be quiet?

17:54.254 --> 17:56.131
Some of us are still trying
to finish our test.

17:56.494 --> 17:58.644
Actually, Stewart, it's only you.

18:01.014 --> 18:03.164
You have two minutes left.

18:04.374 --> 18:06.729
No pressure, 1 : <i>5</i> 8...

18:08.214 --> 18:10.011
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

18:10.054 --> 18:11.123
Thank you.

18:16.774 --> 18:19.288
She can't do it without dancing.
We have to distract Kunkle.

18:19.334 --> 18:20.369
Way ahead of you.

18:20.414 --> 18:23.565
You want a paper-cut,
bit-my-tongue, or a nosebleed?

18:23.614 --> 18:25.252
Nosebleed is my favourite.

18:25.294 --> 18:27.808
Well, lean back
because you're in the splashing zone.

18:35.814 --> 18:38.567
Oh, man! lt's a nosebleed!

18:38.614 --> 18:40.889
-lt's a gusher!
-lt's a gusher, that's what it is.

18:40.934 --> 18:44.847
-Look, everyone, it's a gusher!
-Oken, Oken, honestly!

18:44.894 --> 18:47.169
Paper cuts, bitten tongues
and now nosebleeds.

18:47.214 --> 18:48.533
We should put you in a helmet.

18:48.574 --> 18:51.725
<i>With the parietal bone</i>
<i>it might be crazy</i>

18:51.774 --> 18:54.242
-Stewart!
-Leg cramp.

18:54.854 --> 18:58.324
l just need to, you know,
shake it off with some dance steps.

18:58.374 --> 18:59.727
That's it.

18:59.774 --> 19:02.607
l warned you about cheating.
Your test is over.

19:02.654 --> 19:04.087
But l'm not cheating.

19:04.134 --> 19:06.648
l know the answers,
and l can prove it if l can move it.

19:06.694 --> 19:10.050
l suggest you move it
down to the principal's office.

19:10.094 --> 19:11.766
Just go down the hall,
make a left, then a right,

19:11.814 --> 19:13.805
when you see your brother,
you're there.

19:21.614 --> 19:24.970
<i>Everybody knows the bones</i>
<i>just had to find a way</i>

19:25.014 --> 19:26.572
<i>Everybody knows</i>
<i>what l'm talking about</i>

19:26.614 --> 19:28.047
<i>That's how l'll get an A</i>

19:28.094 --> 19:32.246
-Stewart, l thought l told you...
-Just give her a chance! Please.

19:33.334 --> 19:36.565
<i>My bod has many parts</i>
<i>and this is where it starts</i>

19:36.614 --> 19:39.731
<i>Phalanges, l have ten</i>
<i>and metatarsals then</i>

19:39.774 --> 19:42.971
<i>l got some tarsals, too</i>
<i>l'll put them in my shoe</i>

19:43.014 --> 19:45.005
<i>She's telling the truth</i>

19:53.654 --> 19:57.044
<i>And now l'm up to my knee</i>

19:57.094 --> 19:59.244
<i>That's the patella to me</i>

19:59.294 --> 20:02.843

<i>We'll get it perfect</i>

20:16.814 --> 20:20.443
Come on, everybody!
Move those femurs.

20:22.934 --> 20:25.050
Yeah, by the look of these tests,

20:25.094 --> 20:27.733
you losers need all the help
you can get.

20:28.134 --> 20:31.410
<i>We're doing the bone dance</i>

-l'm going to get the principal.
-What?

21:14.534 --> 21:16.843
l want you to show him that dance.

21:16.894 --> 21:20.125

<i>Study the answers</i>

21:40.334 --> 21:41.369
What?

21:41.814 --> 21:44.328
That song. Those moves.

21:44.374 --> 21:45.693
Your voice.

21:45.734 --> 21:48.294
lt all reminds me
of some famous singer.

21:49.574 --> 21:50.768
Kelly Clarkson?

21:51.494 --> 21:52.643
Hilary Duff?

22:10.694 --> 22:13.254
You're right, what was l thinking?

This bubble brain could never
pull off something like that.

22:16.534 --> 22:18.047
Yeah, what were you thinking?
