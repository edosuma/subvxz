you’ll be like,

16:04.709 --> 16:06.709
"Oh, I’m on page 800!

16:06.709 --> 16:09.208
No way, I just started!"

16:09.208 --> 16:10.333
(laughing)

16:10.333 --> 16:11.333
I’ll be right back!

16:12.750 --> 16:13.875
Thanks, Greg.

16:13.875 --> 16:16.083
Now we all have
to read 800 pages

16:16.083 --> 16:17.875
of Mom’s erotic fantasies.

16:17.875 --> 16:19.083
MATT: Oh, God.

16:19.083 --> 16:21.834
JOHN: You know, I love Joan,
but I’m not gonna read 800 pages

16:21.834 --> 16:24.250
unless there’s
800 Waldos to find.

16:24.250 --> 16:26.834
Yeah, and--and I still
have that bar mitzvah.

16:26.834 --> 16:31.542
♪

16:31.542 --> 16:33.375
Oh, Son of Joan!

16:33.375 --> 16:35.458
-Yeah.
-Ah, Professor Wilde.

16:35.458 --> 16:36.583
Your mother invited me

16:36.583 --> 16:38.250
to facilitate
this literary discussion.

16:38.250 --> 16:39.667
It also gives you
a chance to purchase

16:39.667 --> 16:41.250
my own masterpiece.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.583
<i>Professor Wilde’s</i>
<i>Wild Word Searches.</i>

16:43.583 --> 16:45.250
Yes, and if books
aren’t your thing,

16:45.250 --> 16:48.041
I also operate
a mobile car wash

16:48.041 --> 16:50.834
where you can also buy my book
should you change your mind.

16:50.834 --> 16:51.834
Oh.

16:54.542 --> 16:55.667
Yes, good.

16:57.458 --> 16:58.583
(groaning)

16:58.583 --> 17:01.375
GREG: Hey, guys, you ready
to talk about Mom’s book?

17:01.375 --> 17:04.709
MATT: Oh, man, I--I got to say,
I owe you an apology.

17:04.709 --> 17:06.125
Apology accepted.

17:06.125 --> 17:07.500
MATT: I thought
this was fantastic.

17:07.500 --> 17:08.500
-Yeah.
COLLEEN: Yes, yes.

17:08.500 --> 17:09.625
I mean, once I got
used to the way

17:09.625 --> 17:11.542
that she spelled "vagina,"
I was hooked.

17:11.542 --> 17:15.458
The woman knows longing
and now so do I.

17:15.458 --> 17:18.125
Yeah, yeah, it’s great,
I laughed out loud.

17:18.917 --> 17:20.250
Really?

17:20.250 --> 17:21.750
’Cause it was relentlessly sad.

17:21.750 --> 17:25.125
I mean, a baby died
every few pages.

17:25.125 --> 17:26.834
Well, yeah,
but between the dead babies,

17:26.834 --> 17:29.709
I mean, there were
some solid laughs.

17:29.709 --> 17:31.083
(gasping)

17:31.083 --> 17:32.166
You didn’t read it, did you?

17:32.166 --> 17:33.959
HEATHER: Uh-uh.

17:33.959 --> 17:35.417
Of course I did.

17:35.417 --> 17:37.583
Name one character.

17:37.583 --> 17:41.375
Bill Flar... gus.

17:41.375 --> 17:42.458
Nope.

17:42.458 --> 17:44.625
Bill Flargus, Esquire?

17:44.625 --> 17:45.959
Okay, fine,
I didn’t read the book.

17:45.959 --> 17:47.041
-Oh!
-Ah!

17:47.041 --> 17:49.125
Greg, come on, man!

17:49.125 --> 17:51.792
You are the only reason
that we did this!

17:51.792 --> 17:53.458
Yeah, I mean,
she dedicated the book to you

17:53.458 --> 17:55.166
and there are, like,
six characters in there

17:55.166 --> 17:56.959
named Greg.

17:56.959 --> 18:00.417
Guys, it’s not easy
being Mom’s North Star, okay?

18:00.417 --> 18:02.333
Look, just tell me what the book
is about and I’ll fake it.

18:02.333 --> 18:03.417
(laughing)

18:03.417 --> 18:05.875
Oh, no. N-n-n-n-no way.

18:05.875 --> 18:08.709
You guys are being
real immature, you know that?

18:08.709 --> 18:09.750
Daddy!

18:11.875 --> 18:14.041
Hey, Dad, um, I need your help.

18:14.041 --> 18:15.250
I didn’t read Mom’s book,

18:15.250 --> 18:17.417
so, could you just
tell me what happens?

18:17.417 --> 18:19.458
Aw, Greg,
why didn’t you read it?

18:19.458 --> 18:22.041
Well, that thing weighs a ton
and you know how bad my back is.

18:22.041 --> 18:23.250
I mean, once Mom
put it in the car,

18:23.250 --> 18:24.750
there was no way
it was coming out,

18:24.750 --> 18:27.041
and I don’t read while I drive,
it’s not safe.

18:27.041 --> 18:28.709
Well, that’s a lousy excuse.

18:28.709 --> 18:30.667
All right, I’ll tell you
about the book,

18:30.667 --> 18:32.125
but I got to warn you,

18:32.125 --> 18:33.959
there’s a lot of
"vajinna" talk.

18:38.333 --> 18:41.583
Well, thank you all for coming
together for Joan’s book,

18:41.583 --> 18:44.375
which I personally
found incredibly banal.

18:44.375 --> 18:47.125
Oh, no, you didn’t like it?

18:47.125 --> 18:48.750
Oh, is that what
that word means?

18:48.750 --> 18:50.166
-Yeah.
-Oh, dear.

18:50.166 --> 18:51.875
Looks like I have
some online reviews

18:51.875 --> 18:52.959
I need to revise.

18:52.959 --> 18:54.375
(laughing)

18:54.375 --> 18:57.625
Look, today I need you all
to be brutally honest with me.

18:57.625 --> 18:59.500
Well, in that case,
I saw Professor Wilde

18:59.500 --> 19:02.125
going through
your underwear drawer.

19:02.125 --> 19:05.583
HEATHER: Greg, why don’t you
just get us started here?

19:05.583 --> 19:07.834
Yes, Gregory, we’d love
to hear your thoughts.

19:07.834 --> 19:09.834
-Yeah.
-Well, Matthew, Heather,

19:09.834 --> 19:11.500
I would be delighted
to discuss

19:11.500 --> 19:15.041
our mutual mother’s novel,
’cause I, for one, loved it!

19:15.041 --> 19:16.375
I thought it was fantastic.

19:16.375 --> 19:18.709
I mean, really, just
incredible stuff all around.

19:18.709 --> 19:21.458
Inspired, really, I mean,
especially that ending.

19:21.458 --> 19:22.917
-I didn’t see it coming.
-Oh.

19:22.917 --> 19:24.625
GREG: I mean, when the murderer
turns out

19:24.625 --> 19:26.500
to be the palomino, I mean...

19:26.500 --> 19:28.709
What palomino?

19:28.709 --> 19:31.792
The palomino
with the, uh--the--

19:31.792 --> 19:34.667
the vajinna, the fajita?

19:34.667 --> 19:37.208
JOAN: Oh, you didn’t read it,
did you?

19:37.208 --> 19:39.041
You set me up?

19:39.041 --> 19:41.750
-Dad!
-Oh, Gregory.

19:41.750 --> 19:44.709
I can’t believe you didn’t read
our mutual mother’s book.

19:44.709 --> 19:46.750
HEATHER:
The important thing here

19:46.750 --> 19:50.291
is that Greg proved himself
to be a huge disappointment.

19:50.291 --> 19:51.959
Huge!

19:51.959 --> 19:56.834
Wait, I--your lie
has given me an--an idea!

19:56.834 --> 19:58.917
What if Judge Jasmine

19:58.917 --> 20:01.792
has been lying
to cover up the fact

20:01.792 --> 20:04.959
that she gave away her
love child, Greg, years ago.

20:04.959 --> 20:06.750
-Oh, that--that’s brilliant!
-Yes!

20:06.750 --> 20:08.458
What’s funny is,
I was thinking just the exact

20:08.458 --> 20:10.625
same idea
right after you said it.

20:10.625 --> 20:12.583
I mean, it’s genius.

20:12.583 --> 20:14.875
And I don’t just bandy
that word around, you know?

20:14.875 --> 20:16.709
Well, it’s actually
here on your card.

20:16.709 --> 20:19.083
It says, "Genius Car Detail.

20:19.083 --> 20:21.291
Have your car
washed by a genius."

20:21.291 --> 20:23.417
Thank you, honey!

20:23.417 --> 20:26.166
Your lie saved my book.

20:26.166 --> 20:28.333
-Oh, boo!
-Boo!

20:28.333 --> 20:32.291
Well, happy to help, Mom,
in any way I can!

20:32.291 --> 20:34.709
And, uh, I know I speak
for everyone here,

20:34.709 --> 20:36.291
especially Matthew and Heather,

20:36.291 --> 20:39.083
when I say we can’t wait
to read your rewrite.

20:39.083 --> 20:40.458
-Yeah.
-Yeah,

20:40.458 --> 20:41.750
we’re looking forward to it.
