01:11.655 --> 01:13.065
You weren't followed?

01:13.991 --> 01:15.447
No.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.407
Better come in.

01:21.832 --> 01:24.619
Trust no one, Jim.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.787
Especially not in the mainstream.

01:32.217 --> 01:33.753
Sit down.

01:46.023 --> 01:50.266
I understand you still have
one Hungarian identity running?

01:52.279 --> 01:53.815
I do.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.323
I want you to go to Budapest.

02:04.750 --> 02:07.412
This is not above board.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.626
Nobody else knows.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.672
They're after my head, Jim boy.

02:15.302 --> 02:17.088
Do you understand?

02:40.786 --> 02:43.823
I have had an offer of service.

02:45.957 --> 02:49.495
A Hungarian general
wants to come over.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.953
I would like you to meet him.

02:56.051 --> 02:59.339
He has some information
that I need, Jim.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.506
What information?

03:05.352 --> 03:06.967
Treasure.

03:10.148 --> 03:12.685
He has the name of the mole

03:12.818 --> 03:16.481
the Russians have planted
in the British intelligence service

03:16.613 --> 03:19.525
right at the top of the Circus.

03:24.705 --> 03:28.243
There's a rotten apple, Jim.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.536
We have to find it.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.812
Stop!

06:36.229 --> 06:39.642
Would you witness this for me?

06:39.774 --> 06:42.436
I wish I could done more, Control.

06:42.569 --> 06:45.151
You did all you could, Percy.

06:49.242 --> 06:53.986
Well, a man should know
when to leave the party.

06:57.292 --> 06:59.328
What about Smiley?

07:00.211 --> 07:02.623
Smiley is leaving with me.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.233
You little prick, Esterhase.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.161
Gentlemen, shall we start?

12:51.062 --> 12:54.054
Under Secretary Lacon
is ready for you, Sir Percy.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.602
The Treasury don't understand.

13:00.738 --> 13:03.946
Why can't the intelligence service
simply put in a request

13:04.075 --> 13:05.656
for a general increase in funding

13:05.785 --> 13:08.697
and then you account
for the spend on your special operation?

13:09.789 --> 13:12.576
Operation Witchcraft
needs to remain secret.

13:12.709 --> 13:15.667
- It's a fiefdom of its own.
- Yes, that's what's worrying us.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.411
The whole thing's
very unaccountable, isn't it?

13:20.091 --> 13:23.754
And this London house
that nobody knows the address of,

13:23.886 --> 13:25.501
is that really necessary?

13:25.638 --> 13:29.005
Now more than ever.
We need to protect our Soviet source.

13:29.142 --> 13:32.851
So where do you propose we meet?
In a café?

13:32.979 --> 13:35.686
The rent and rates on this house
have doubled.

13:37.108 --> 13:39.895
We spent millions on nuclear warheads.

13:40.028 --> 13:42.895
We're asking
for a few thousand for a house.

13:43.031 --> 13:45.022
I wonder if Karla has the same problem

13:45.158 --> 13:46.864
with the Treasury at the Kremlin.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.529
Look, nobody underestimates

13:48.661 --> 13:51.277
the importance of the job
you chaps are doing.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.700
But what happened
in Budapest last year,

13:55.752 --> 13:57.583
that was a disaster.

13:57.712 --> 13:59.623
With respect, sir,

13:59.756 --> 14:02.793
it wasn't one of your civil servants
that got killed, was it?

14:02.925 --> 14:05.337
Now this isn't about soldiers
in trenches any more.

14:05.470 --> 14:07.711
- We're the front line now...
- Roy!

14:07.847 --> 14:11.260
For 25 years we've been the only thing
standing between them and Karla

14:11.392 --> 14:13.633
and Moscow
and the third bloody world war.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.938
Look, the Minister's very pleased
with your progress so far.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.733
He's less pleased, though,

14:22.862 --> 14:25.478
with the lack of progress
with our American cousins.

14:27.158 --> 14:28.568
You see,

14:28.701 --> 14:30.737
in their eyes,

14:30.870 --> 14:33.361
you're still a leaky ship.

14:51.599 --> 14:52.554
Yes?

14:52.683 --> 14:55.720
Someone on the line for you, sir.
Seems urgent.

14:55.853 --> 14:57.593
All right, well put him through.

14:59.399 --> 15:02.766
- Hello?
- Is this under Secretary Lacon?

15:02.902 --> 15:04.267
Yes.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.611
My name's Ricki Tarr.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.068
- What do you want?
- I need to meet you.

15:11.327 --> 15:14.740
If you need to confirm who I am,
you can talk to my boss at the Circus,

15:14.872 --> 15:16.612
Peter Guillam.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.411
But only Guillam, no one else.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.514
You got clearance for that?

15:35.643 --> 15:38.510
Well, I'm not bloody
chaining it up outside.

15:38.646 --> 15:41.308
Mind you, no better off in here
with this bunch of bloody cut-throats.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.978
They'd have the gold out of your teeth.

15:44.110 --> 15:47.648
Thought I'd pop in and catch a glimpse
of the new girl before Bland gets to her.

15:47.780 --> 15:51.113
Ah, yes. Belinda the blonde.

15:51.242 --> 15:53.324
- Has he seen her yet?
- Of course he has.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.114
Came down first thing this morning.

15:55.246 --> 15:56.952
Belinda.

16:06.799 --> 16:10.007
- Peter Guillam.
- Hello, Peter, this is Oliver.

16:10.136 --> 16:12.718
Just ringing to find out...

16:12.847 --> 16:16.339
So Winston
Churchill saved your life, Edie.

16:16.476 --> 16:19.058
I was working in the kitchen,
getting dinner ready.

16:19.187 --> 16:20.927
And he was late, you see.

16:21.063 --> 16:23.429
- During a raid?
- During a raid, you see.

16:23.566 --> 16:25.397
He said,
"Why aren't you in that shelter?"

16:25.526 --> 16:27.062
- Why weren't you?
- Well, because...

16:37.079 --> 16:40.663
I was sorry to hear
about Control, Mr Smiley.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.924
He said Tarr called him
from a phone box.

17:04.815 --> 17:07.772
He said there's a mole,

17:09.737 --> 17:12.194
right at the top of the Circus,

17:13.574 --> 17:15.986
that he's been there for years.

17:36.681 --> 17:38.296
It does mean

17:38.432 --> 17:41.424
you're rather well placed
to look into this matter for us now,

17:41.561 --> 17:43.597
doesn't it?

17:44.647 --> 17:46.387
Outside the family.

17:55.825 --> 17:57.941
I'm retired, Oliver.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.284
You fired me.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.278
The thing is,

18:02.415 --> 18:04.326
some time ago before Control died,

18:04.458 --> 18:07.040
he came to me
with a similar suggestion.

18:08.379 --> 18:10.415
That there is a mole.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.709
He never mentioned
his suspicions to you?

18:18.097 --> 18:19.132
No.

18:19.265 --> 18:22.883
Oh, I just thought that
as you were his man, so to speak...

18:23.019 --> 18:25.351
What did you say to him?

18:25.479 --> 18:28.266
I'm afraid I thought his paranoia
had rather gotten the better of him

18:28.399 --> 18:31.357
and he was going to pull
his whole house down.

18:31.485 --> 18:33.601
That bloody mess in Budapest.

18:38.034 --> 18:39.990
Damn it, George.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.201
It's your generation, your legacy.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.990
I would have thought, if there's
any truth in it, you'd want to...

19:18.157 --> 19:20.068
I'll keep Peter.

19:21.494 --> 19:24.827
And there's a retired
Special Branch man, Mendel.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.080
I should like to have him.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.494
Lift up.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.503
And quickly down again.

19:42.556 --> 19:46.014
There's a place I know, sir.
A little hotel near Liverpool Street.

20:19.552 --> 20:24.171
Be careful with it. Please.
It's Georgian.

20:24.306 --> 20:28.094
My friend wants peace and quiet
in order to work, Mrs Pope Graham.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.342
No disturbances.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.811
Her real name is just Graham.

20:32.940 --> 20:35.056
Added the Pope for a touch of class.

20:49.582 --> 20:53.871
Peter, did you get the keys
to Control's flat?

20:59.633 --> 21:05.629
# And did those feet in ancient time

21:05.765 --> 21:10.008
# Walk upon England's
mountains green #

21:12.605 --> 21:13.811
Oh!

22:42.069 --> 22:43.104
George!

22:45.155 --> 22:46.565
George, get in here!

22:50.953 --> 22:52.864
George.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.580
Sit down.

23:01.922 --> 23:04.083
Take a look at this nonsense.

23:09.138 --> 23:10.594
Report by Soviet high command

23:10.723 --> 23:14.591
on their recent naval exercises
in the Black Sea.

23:14.727 --> 23:17.389
Just what the admiralty
has been begging us

23:17.521 --> 23:19.227
for some information on.

23:20.524 --> 23:22.606
- Where did you get this?
- I didn't.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.600
Percy and his little cabal
walked in with it.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.819
- Look, Control...
- Shut up.

23:27.698 --> 23:29.984
Style appalling.

23:30.117 --> 23:33.109
Patently a fabrication
from beginning to end.

23:33.245 --> 23:37.363
- Just could be the real thing.
- Well, if it's genuine, it's gold dust.

23:38.375 --> 23:41.208
But its topicality makes it suspect.

23:41.337 --> 23:44.625
Smiley is suspicious, Percy.

23:44.757 --> 23:47.590
Where did it come from?
What's the access?

23:47.718 --> 23:49.709
A new secret source of mine.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.506
But how could he
possibly have access?

23:51.639 --> 23:54.802
He has access to the most sensitive
levels of policy-making.

23:56.727 --> 23:58.308
We've named the operation Witchcraft.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.395
Oh, Percy and his pals
bypassed us, Smiley.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.684
Gone straight to the minister.

24:03.817 --> 24:08.106
Percy has been allowed to keep
the identity of his new friend

24:08.238 --> 24:09.648
top secret.

24:09.782 --> 24:13.400
The minister agrees too many secrets
are blown around here.

24:13.535 --> 24:15.446
Too much failure,
too many scandals.

24:15.579 --> 24:18.912
- Too little solid intelligence.
- Percy does have a point, Control.

24:19.041 --> 24:21.657
We should be fighting Communism,
not each other.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.501
Meanwhile we're losing our reputation,
our partners.

24:24.630 --> 24:25.961
Your bloody Yanks!

24:26.090 --> 24:28.502
We've had enough!
There's going to be changes.

24:28.634 --> 24:32.422
We need to decide if want to be
part of the past or part of the future.

24:32.554 --> 24:35.671
I should have left you
where I found you.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.844
- Look!
- Control...

24:37.977 --> 24:39.683
Out, all of you!

25:02.584 --> 25:05.792
If Witchcraft is genuine...

25:05.921 --> 25:08.253
Nothing is genuine any more.

25:26.025 --> 25:27.606
George...

25:31.530 --> 25:34.647
Do you want me to get
this stuff over to the hotel?

25:54.762 --> 25:56.969
Thank you. Er, anywhere will do.

25:58.932 --> 26:00.342
- Peter?
- Hm?

26:00.476 --> 26:02.842
I need you to do something for me.

26:12.488 --> 26:14.444
I'd Polyakov you to go to the Circus.

26:17.076 --> 26:20.159
In the cabinet
at the duty officers station

26:20.287 --> 26:22.528
are records of staff recently retired.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.623
I'd like photographs of them

26:27.753 --> 26:32.167
and of the diagram of the Circus's
reorganisation under Percy Alleline,

26:33.092 --> 26:36.960
along with a list of all payments
made from the Reptile fund.

27:09.962 --> 27:13.420
- Help you with anything, Bill?
- I was just looking for his Majesty.

27:13.549 --> 27:15.710
Well, he's out walking the battlements.

27:18.554 --> 27:19.919
Oh.

27:54.965 --> 27:59.174
- Heard you had an accident, Peter.
- Yeah, I cut my hand open on a drawer.

27:59.303 --> 28:02.010
When are you going
to get some new furniture up here?

28:04.850 --> 28:08.388
I'll have a word with Esterhase.
We'll make it a priority on the top floor.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.887
- Where are you off to?
- Lunch.

28:14.318 --> 28:16.104
Want some company?

28:17.196 --> 28:19.232
According to the personnel files,

28:19.364 --> 28:20.945
seven were due for retirement anyway.

28:21.074 --> 28:23.315
Another four don't seem
particularly mysterious.

28:23.452 --> 28:26.444
Jerry Westerby was dismissed
December 4.

28:27.623 --> 28:29.488
Connie Sachs retired November 28.

28:29.625 --> 28:32.788
That's just two weeks
after you and Control were forced out.

28:42.471 --> 28:45.213
- Return to Oxford, please.
- That's 1.15.

29:03.867 --> 29:06.779
Percy has always resisted
any proposal

29:06.912 --> 29:10.700
of a wider exploitation
of Witchcraft's intelligence.

29:10.832 --> 29:12.697
Drop the bloody jargon, Lacon.

29:12.834 --> 29:15.667
I've refused to share Witchcraft
with our allies so far, Minister.

29:17.089 --> 29:18.829
Greedy boy.

29:18.966 --> 29:22.458
My goal has been to establish
its track record beyond all doubt.

29:26.640 --> 29:30.383
I think the time has come to approach
our American brothers-in-arms.

29:32.938 --> 29:36.977
- Will they take us back into bed?
- I'm not interested in a one-off trade.

29:37.109 --> 29:41.603
I want on-going access
to American intelligence.

29:41.738 --> 29:43.319
You think we can get it?

29:43.448 --> 29:47.191
With Witchcraft on our side, we can
get anything we bloody well want.

29:51.623 --> 29:52.954
Fine.

29:53.959 --> 29:55.074
Carry on.

29:58.380 --> 29:59.790
Thank you.

30:11.226 --> 30:13.888
And I strike thee down...

30:39.588 --> 30:40.703
Oh, I, er...

30:44.634 --> 30:47.751
Not supposed to.
Doctor's orders.

30:50.515 --> 30:52.426
Wicked, wicked George.

31:14.456 --> 31:16.412
I don't know about you, George,

31:16.541 --> 31:19.032
but I feel seriously under-fucked.

31:22.881 --> 31:25.042
I heard Ann left you again.

31:27.386 --> 31:30.924
She doesn't deserve you, George,
not one hair on your head.

31:31.056 --> 31:35.299
You left the Circus
shortly after I retired.

31:36.686 --> 31:39.928
I didn't leave. I was dismissed.

31:40.065 --> 31:43.933
Chucked out on the rubbish heap,
like you.

31:44.069 --> 31:45.058
Why?

31:50.534 --> 31:51.694
Polyakov.

31:52.828 --> 31:54.693
Do you remember him?

31:56.081 --> 31:57.992
From the Soviet Embassy?

31:58.125 --> 32:02.084
Alexsey Polyakov,
cultural attaché here in London.

32:03.296 --> 32:07.539
When he arrived here 15 years ago,
I requested he be checked out.

32:08.718 --> 32:12.336
He was graded whiter than white.
Didn't put a foot wrong.

32:13.682 --> 32:15.593
But you disagreed?

32:15.725 --> 32:17.511
There's a story
you must have heard

32:17.644 --> 32:20.602
that Karla has set up a secret cell.

32:20.730 --> 32:22.686
The personnel are all ex-military,

32:22.816 --> 32:26.900
trained to handle
deep-penetration agents, moles.

32:27.028 --> 32:29.815
There are always stories,
Connie.

32:29.948 --> 32:32.439
But what if this story was true?

32:34.327 --> 32:38.195
One night in research
I saw something, George.

32:38.331 --> 32:41.823
There was our friend Polyakov
at a May day parade in Berlin

32:41.960 --> 32:44.576
receiving a salute.

32:44.713 --> 32:47.500
Why would you salute
a cultural attaché?

32:47.632 --> 32:51.341
Exactly.
Unless he was a war veteran himself.

32:51.470 --> 32:55.179
And if he was, why hide the fact?

32:55.307 --> 32:56.968
What did you do?

32:57.100 --> 32:59.716
I went straight to Esterhase and Alleline.

33:00.812 --> 33:03.019
Here.

33:03.148 --> 33:06.561
Polyakov is a Karla-trained hood
if ever I saw one.

33:06.693 --> 33:08.809
If he's here, it must be
because he's running a mole.

33:08.945 --> 33:11.027
You're to leave Polyakov alone.

33:11.156 --> 33:13.272
You're becoming obsessed with him.

33:16.411 --> 33:19.448
- You're losing your sense of proportion.
- But that's ridiculous.

33:19.581 --> 33:22.698
Perhaps it's time
you went out into the real world.

33:35.305 --> 33:39.173
What does it matter?
Old Circus is gone anyway.

33:55.992 --> 33:58.028
Here we are.

33:58.161 --> 34:00.197
The Nursery in our day.

34:02.374 --> 34:04.285
Jim Prideaux.

34:04.417 --> 34:08.034
And Bill Haydon.
Together, of course.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.541
The Inseparables.

34:13.802 --> 34:15.838
There's Control himself.

34:16.972 --> 34:18.632
All my boys.

34:20.225 --> 34:22.716
All my lovely boys.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.766
That was a good time, George.

34:34.364 --> 34:36.605
A real war.

34:36.741 --> 34:38.902
Englishmen could be proud then.

34:46.458 --> 34:48.949
So I was right, then?

34:49.087 --> 34:51.373
About Polyakov.

34:51.505 --> 34:53.371
There is a mole.

34:57.304 --> 35:02.424
If it's bad, don't come back.
I want to remember you all as you were.

35:08.106 --> 35:12.019
Percy?
Percy, did you mix this?

35:13.111 --> 35:14.976
Aye, I did so.

35:15.113 --> 35:18.822
You Calvinistic, penny-pinching Scot.

35:18.950 --> 35:22.113
Can you nae learn
to take a bloody order?

35:22.245 --> 35:25.328
Nobody tampers with the recipe!

35:25.457 --> 35:27.288
- I followed the recipe.
- Come on.

35:27.417 --> 35:30.534
It'll take us five hours
to get drunk on this monkey's piss.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.712
# He's not the first

35:37.844 --> 35:40.711
- # He's not the first
- Oh, well.

35:40.847 --> 35:43.839
- # He's the second best secret agent
- Merry Christmas.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.886
# In the whole wide world

35:46.019 --> 35:48.510
# He's not number one

35:48.647 --> 35:51.184
# But not the worst

35:51.316 --> 35:54.023
# He's just the second best
secret agent

35:54.152 --> 35:56.894
# In the whole wide world

35:57.030 --> 35:58.691
# He's every bit

35:58.823 --> 36:01.030
# As good as what's-his-name

36:02.494 --> 36:05.031
# With a dame

36:05.163 --> 36:07.449
# Any dame

36:07.582 --> 36:11.951
# And all those bullet holes
are in his vest

36:13.046 --> 36:16.038
# To prove you work a little harder

36:16.174 --> 36:18.460
# When you're second best... #

38:08.036 --> 38:10.994
- Courtesy of Mrs P.
- Hm?

38:11.122 --> 38:13.204
You been up all night?

38:14.501 --> 38:15.991
Yes.

38:23.635 --> 38:25.045
What's this?

38:25.178 --> 38:30.013
Request for £ 1,000 in cash
from the Reptile fund.

38:30.141 --> 38:32.348
To a Mr Ellis.

38:32.477 --> 38:35.059
It was one of Jim Prideaux's
work names.

38:36.272 --> 38:39.059
Prideaux was killed
in Hungary a year ago.

38:39.192 --> 38:40.648
October 21.

38:41.694 --> 38:45.653
So why was someone giving him
£ 1,000 two months later?

38:48.535 --> 38:50.617
I wonder where he is then, sir.

39:20.233 --> 39:21.769
Settle down now.

39:29.868 --> 39:32.154
- Hand those out.
- Sir.

39:32.287 --> 39:34.152
What is it?
The Hunchback of Notre-Dame?

39:38.376 --> 39:40.913
The bells, the bells!

40:21.920 --> 40:23.285
Come here.

40:31.304 --> 40:33.886
- I'm a new boy.
- New arrival, eh?

40:34.015 --> 40:37.178
- What's the story?
- My mother and father.

40:38.394 --> 40:41.261
My father left, so...

40:41.397 --> 40:42.728
Hm.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.307
Bill.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.150
The unpaid Bill.

40:49.614 --> 40:52.651
- Anyone ever call you that?
- No, sir.

40:52.784 --> 40:54.866
Known a lot of Bills in my time.

40:56.955 --> 40:59.116
They've all been gooduns.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.199
What are you good at?

41:03.336 --> 41:04.826
Nothing, sir.

41:04.963 --> 41:07.796
You're a good watcher, though, eh?

41:08.758 --> 41:10.464
Us loners always are.

41:16.140 --> 41:18.882
Best watcher in the unit,
Bill Roach is, I'll bet.

41:20.311 --> 41:23.678
- Long as he's got his specs on. Right?
- Yes, sir.

41:25.066 --> 41:27.182
This is good, very good.

42:52.278 --> 42:53.768
Hello, Ricki.

43:01.370 --> 43:03.361
You've missed the wedge.

43:10.755 --> 43:12.871
Where have you been, Ricki?

43:15.551 --> 43:17.587
They're going to kill me.

43:19.889 --> 43:22.255
- Who is?
- Your lot.

43:22.391 --> 43:24.723
Or their lot.
Whoever gets me first.

43:27.563 --> 43:29.895
I'm innocent.

43:30.024 --> 43:31.560
Within reason.

43:33.444 --> 43:35.309
How long have you been here?

43:35.446 --> 43:38.358
Sorry, I've run out of places now.

43:38.491 --> 43:40.402
I needed to see you.

43:41.327 --> 43:42.783
Why?

43:44.705 --> 43:46.616
There's a woman.

43:48.126 --> 43:51.618
I need you to trade for her.
I need you to get her back off Karla.

43:54.966 --> 43:56.581
A woman?

43:58.928 --> 44:01.385
Her name's Irina.

44:05.268 --> 44:07.475
This was last November.

44:07.603 --> 44:12.438
Mr Guillam sent me to Istanbul
to check out a Russian trade delegate

44:12.567 --> 44:14.478
who might be persuaded to defect.

44:14.610 --> 44:17.443
Tufty Thesinger, resident.
- Yeah.

44:17.572 --> 44:19.028
- Hiya, Ricki.
- All right, mate?

44:19.157 --> 44:22.741
Did you know him?
No, never met him.

44:22.869 --> 44:24.609
Bit of a drinker.

44:24.745 --> 44:26.326
Hangover from hell.

44:26.455 --> 44:28.537
Bit of a fucking idiot.

44:30.835 --> 44:32.746
Apparently this Russian,
name of Boris,

44:32.879 --> 44:35.336
was spending high and wide
in the nightclubs.

44:35.464 --> 44:38.046
So you were sent
to persuade this Boris?

44:38.176 --> 44:41.543
Yeah.
He was your typical Russian.

44:41.679 --> 44:44.762
Trade delegation by day,
out boozing every night.

44:44.891 --> 44:46.756
Didn't seem to sleep.

44:46.893 --> 44:49.054
Tufty was worn out
from following him around.

44:49.187 --> 44:52.054
I think it's going to be
a long night, son.

44:52.190 --> 44:54.932
His favourite haunt
was this club in Taksim.

44:55.067 --> 44:59.606
It had a hellhole in the basement
where the sailors and the tourists went.

45:01.115 --> 45:05.233
Anyway, I took one look at him
and I knew I'd wasted a journey.

45:07.496 --> 45:09.202
Boris was no delegate.

45:10.625 --> 45:14.209
What delegate bothers
to play drunker than he really is?

45:15.546 --> 45:18.413
You get to recognise your own,
don't you, Mr Smiley?

45:22.094 --> 45:24.210
Moscow Centre trained.

45:24.347 --> 45:26.884
# Someone is waiting

45:27.016 --> 45:28.802
# I mean just for you

45:29.518 --> 45:31.179
# Spinning wheel

45:31.312 --> 45:34.770
# Keep on spinning through,
Drop all your troubles... #

45:34.899 --> 45:37.641
I guessed he was waiting
for a connect.

45:39.445 --> 45:41.777
Working a letterbox, maybe.

45:41.906 --> 45:46.491
Or trailing his coat and looking
for a pass from some mug like me.

45:46.619 --> 45:49.782
So the second night
I went to the import/export outfit

45:49.914 --> 45:54.578
that Tufty had set up with
a cipher room hidden in the back.

45:54.710 --> 45:57.747
I cabled "No sale" to Mr Guillam.

45:58.923 --> 46:00.914
And that was that.

46:02.385 --> 46:04.592
You were due
to fly home the next day.

46:04.720 --> 46:06.130
Yes.

46:08.099 --> 46:09.885
But you didn't.

46:23.364 --> 46:25.605
Boris had a wife.

46:25.741 --> 46:27.151
Common-law.

46:28.077 --> 46:32.116
Apparently she was a member
of the delegation in her own right.

47:30.056 --> 47:33.719
You once told me to trust my instincts
about women, Mr Smiley.

47:35.019 --> 47:38.477
Well, my instincts told me
this woman had some treasure.

47:42.360 --> 47:47.104
When Boris went out for the night,
I found myself going into her hotel.

47:47.239 --> 47:49.104
So you dropped Boris.

47:49.241 --> 47:52.608
I know.
It was breaking protocol.

47:54.038 --> 47:57.951
But I was acting on my own initiative,
as it were.

47:58.084 --> 48:01.076
Your man's a bit of a bastard, isn't he?

48:01.212 --> 48:04.295
I just wanted to make sure
you were all right, OK?

48:04.423 --> 48:06.539
So you didn't come home?

48:07.885 --> 48:10.752
I would have.

48:10.888 --> 48:13.004
Boris was a dead end, but...

48:15.101 --> 48:16.466
Um...

48:17.228 --> 48:18.468
I could...

48:19.814 --> 48:22.726
I could sense something in her.

48:23.984 --> 48:26.191
A secret.

48:26.320 --> 48:31.781
And how did you intend
to get this secret out of her?

48:39.083 --> 48:42.075
I played this businessman,
Michael Trench.

48:46.465 --> 48:48.126
Holiday romance.

48:52.138 --> 48:54.754
I thought I'd take my time with it.

49:45.566 --> 49:47.852
I know who you are.

49:49.653 --> 49:52.690
I want to talk to your boss.

49:52.823 --> 49:54.404
Control.

49:57.119 --> 49:59.656
I have something to trade.

49:59.788 --> 50:01.324
Something big.

50:02.541 --> 50:05.123
I want a new life in the West.

50:06.754 --> 50:08.836
That's the deal.

50:11.217 --> 50:13.128
You tell them.

50:22.019 --> 50:25.682
Look, you can't expect them
to jump at every offer of service.

50:29.193 --> 50:33.152
If you won't tell me more,
there is nothing I can do.

50:38.786 --> 50:41.493
If I tell you everything,

50:41.622 --> 50:43.533
I'm putting my life in your hands.

50:45.918 --> 50:48.000
And the lives of other people.

51:49.481 --> 51:52.439
So she told me
what she had to trade.

51:54.194 --> 51:56.150
Her secret.

51:56.280 --> 51:58.612
I mean,

51:58.741 --> 52:00.948
the mother of all secrets.

52:04.121 --> 52:06.578
I told her I'd alert the Circus.

52:06.707 --> 52:10.325
She made me promise I wouldn't
give any of the details to London.

52:10.461 --> 52:13.328
And you agreed?
Yes.

52:14.632 --> 52:16.293
I mean it was...

52:16.425 --> 52:19.667
I couldn't believe
I'd got hold of something this big.

52:19.803 --> 52:22.590
I went back to the import/export,

52:22.723 --> 52:26.807
sent the message to the Circus,
graded, "Flash, highest priority",

52:26.935 --> 52:30.177
just that I had a Moscow-trained hood
wanting to defect.

52:30.314 --> 52:35.149
You're supposed to have gone.
London stations have been on to me.

52:35.277 --> 52:37.518
Want to know what the hell you're doing.

52:42.451 --> 52:44.032
Fuck off.

52:45.287 --> 52:47.243
Anything else, Ricki?

52:51.669 --> 52:54.536
I know what I am to the Circus.
I'm one of the scalp-hunters,

52:54.672 --> 52:57.584
someone that you can hand
your dirty little jobs to.

53:01.178 --> 53:02.714
I just...

53:04.348 --> 53:07.055
I just wanted to bring
this one in myself.

53:07.184 --> 53:09.516
Well, I understand how you felt.

53:11.730 --> 53:14.062
You wanted to do something.

53:16.568 --> 53:19.526
Vital to the safeguarding of the Circus.

53:22.741 --> 53:24.481
Anything more?

53:36.922 --> 53:40.631
I said that she had information
concerning a double agent.

53:43.887 --> 53:48.256
Look, I just wanted to get
the proper attention. And I'd...

53:50.102 --> 53:52.388
I told them this was the reason
why I had not come home.

53:52.521 --> 53:54.762
It wasn't that I'd defected or anything.

53:56.400 --> 53:59.563
- What did you do then?
- I waited for a reply.

54:05.576 --> 54:08.443
I hung around for hours.
I heard the Imsak call to prayer.

54:08.579 --> 54:12.447
So what's that?
That's about 3.30 in the morning.

54:15.043 --> 54:16.783
Then the message comes through.

54:20.799 --> 54:23.131
"'We read you. "

54:24.845 --> 54:27.427
That was all they sent. Nothing.

54:28.348 --> 54:31.886
It didn't make sense.
It was like they were stalling.

54:38.609 --> 54:40.520
Then what happened?

54:40.652 --> 54:43.610
Then, all of a sudden...

54:45.365 --> 54:47.777
...the Russians begin to move.

55:21.193 --> 55:25.106
It was nice work.
I couldn't have done it better myself.

55:31.537 --> 55:35.496
The message was quite clear.
I needed to warn her.

56:32.306 --> 56:34.137
Come on, come on, come on.

56:49.406 --> 56:51.613
I couldn't find her at the airport.

56:51.742 --> 56:54.575
I even looked through
all the flight lists and...

56:56.413 --> 56:58.028
I headed down to the harbour.

57:09.259 --> 57:11.375
They put her on a ship to Odessa.

57:13.639 --> 57:15.550
That's all I know.

57:25.776 --> 57:27.186
I've...

57:32.449 --> 57:36.567
I've done a lot of things in my life,
Mr Smiley, but...

57:42.626 --> 57:46.164
I just...
I can't stop thinking about her.

57:50.467 --> 57:52.549
She wasn't even my type.

57:56.765 --> 57:58.972
I've got to get her out.
I owe her that.

58:04.564 --> 58:07.727
Karla will be looking for you.

58:07.859 --> 58:10.646
Everybody's looking for me.

58:13.448 --> 58:15.439
You can't stay here.

58:17.869 --> 58:19.484
It isn't safe.

58:22.666 --> 58:26.204
I said, "You may fuck me
but you'll call me "Sir" in the morning. "

58:27.796 --> 58:31.755
OK.
Just need to let you know.

58:31.883 --> 58:35.876
Someone flew into Paris last week
on one of our escaped passports.

58:36.013 --> 58:39.346
And?
It was Ricki Tarr.

58:40.934 --> 58:42.595
'Why are you telling me?

58:42.728 --> 58:45.686
- It could be coincidence...
- You are a poisoned dwarf.

58:45.814 --> 58:47.304
'Why don't you fuck off to his Majesty

58:47.441 --> 58:49.773
and stop trying to involve me
in your cabaret?

58:53.113 --> 58:57.026
'Mr Esterhase:
"It could be coincidence but... "

58:58.744 --> 59:00.826
Mr Haydon interrupting.

59:00.954 --> 59:03.616
"'You really are a poisoned dwarf,
Toby.

59:04.833 --> 59:06.573
"'Why don't you fuck off to his Majesty

59:06.710 --> 59:09.201
"'and stop trying to involve me
in your cabaret?"'

59:21.975 --> 59:23.431
You look tired.

59:25.896 --> 59:27.682
I didn't sleep well.

59:30.567 --> 59:33.149
You're going to do something
for me, Peter.

59:34.112 --> 59:37.650
I need the duty officer's log book
for last November.

59:39.159 --> 59:43.573
I'm going to have to send you
up a floor into the lions den.

59:48.001 --> 59:49.457
If you're caught,

59:54.007 --> 59:56.714
I'm sorry, but you're alone.

59:57.594 --> 01:00:00.711
- Last November?
- Hm.

01:00:11.149 --> 01:00:12.605
Mr Guillam!

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:16.768
Thank you, Bryant.

01:00:16.905 --> 01:00:18.111
How's the family?

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.652
Fine. Need to go
up to the registry today.

01:00:20.784 --> 01:00:22.320
OK, sir.

01:00:23.245 --> 01:00:26.328
Now you'll need
a yellow one for the bag, sir.

01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:31.203
Thank you.

01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:56.396
- Good morning, Mr Guillam.
- Morning, Alwyn.

01:00:56.528 --> 01:00:58.985
- Want me to look after that for you?
- Thank you.

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:06.818
I'll need your chit, Mr Guillam.

01:01:06.955 --> 01:01:08.786
Dolphin will kill me if I don't.
New rules.

01:01:10.834 --> 01:01:12.415
So, chit me.

01:01:18.383 --> 01:01:19.839
Thanks.

01:01:21.011 --> 01:01:23.969
- Sal, lovely surprise.
- Peter.

01:01:31.313 --> 01:01:33.770
- What are you up to this weekend?
- Oh, you know.

01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:37.562
Visiting aunts.

01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:39.605
I'll bet.

01:01:47.662 --> 01:01:49.072
Corridor D.

01:01:49.206 --> 01:01:51.447
The two eights are halfway
on your right.

01:01:51.583 --> 01:01:53.369
The three ones are next alcove down.

01:01:53.501 --> 01:01:55.366
Thanks.

01:02:40.882 --> 01:02:43.123
Here's a request
from Libby Barr from Bromley

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:47.048
for "Mr Wu's A Window Cleaner Now".
Take it away, George.

01:03:03.071 --> 01:03:04.561
Hello. Archive, Alwyn speaking.

01:03:06.366 --> 01:03:08.197
Can I speak
to Mr Guillam, please?

01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:12.198
I'm his car mechanic.

01:03:13.415 --> 01:03:15.952
Well, I'll just see if he's available.
Hold on, please.

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:21.207
# Mr Wu, what shall I do?

01:03:29.514 --> 01:03:32.221
- Oh, Christ!
- Telephone, sir.

01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:35.183
- Who is it?
- Outside line, sir. Someone rough.

01:03:45.447 --> 01:03:46.903
Sir?

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:51.321
- Hello?
- Your gearbox is bust, sir.

01:03:51.453 --> 01:03:53.785
Damn it, can't you fix the bloody thing?

01:03:53.913 --> 01:03:55.028
Can't be done, sir.

01:03:57.459 --> 01:04:01.202
Well, phone the main dealership first.
Have you got their number?

01:04:01.338 --> 01:04:02.418
No.

01:04:02.547 --> 01:04:04.538
Hang on. Alwyn!

01:04:06.343 --> 01:04:08.129
- Alwyn.
- Sir?

01:04:08.261 --> 01:04:09.717
Get me my bag, will you?

01:04:09.846 --> 01:04:11.586
- But...
- Just for a second.

01:04:19.189 --> 01:04:21.100
Thank you.

01:04:21.232 --> 01:04:22.722
Hang on.

01:04:38.166 --> 01:04:40.248
- Hello?
- I'm listening.

01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:43.665
- Yes. 9-4-60-3-3-5.
- Be right on it, sir.

01:04:43.797 --> 01:04:45.287
Thank you.

01:04:49.677 --> 01:04:51.383
Peter Guillam.

01:04:51.513 --> 01:04:54.050
Could we see you, please?

01:04:54.182 --> 01:04:56.138
Percy would like
quite an urgent word with you.

01:04:56.267 --> 01:04:59.179
If you can come now to the fifth floor
that would be so kind.

01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:00.768
Yes, of course.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:04.765
Throw that into the lift for me.

01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:07.438
Send it to the second floor,
save me filling out bloody chits.

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:09.231
Will do, sir.

01:05:28.299 --> 01:05:31.132
So what have you been getting up to
down there these days?

01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:33.547
Apart from chasing our virgins.

01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:38.048
A couple of Arab ploys
that look quite promising.

01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:42.435
Apart from that,
I'm getting quite good at ping-pong.

01:05:42.564 --> 01:05:44.395
Arabs.

01:05:44.524 --> 01:05:47.140
You can rent one but you can't buy one.
Right, Bill?

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:53.487
How's Ricki Tarr these days?

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:56.528
Fine. We have tea
at Fortnum's every afternoon.

01:05:58.246 --> 01:06:01.158
I require the matter
of your discussion with Tarr.

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:03.452
I'll tell him. He'll be thrilled.

01:06:11.301 --> 01:06:13.166
What's that shrug for?

01:06:16.139 --> 01:06:18.050
I'm talking to you about the traitor

01:06:18.183 --> 01:06:21.675
who cut the throat
of our man in Istanbul.

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:25.144
I'm talking to you about a defector
from your own damn section.

01:06:25.273 --> 01:06:29.186
I'm accusing you of consorting
with an enemy agent behind my back.

01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:31.651
Don't damn well shrug at me!

01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:34.737
How would you like a term in prison?

01:06:45.793 --> 01:06:48.535
Well, I haven't been seeing him.

01:06:50.507 --> 01:06:52.839
So get your facts straight
and get off my back!

01:06:52.967 --> 01:06:56.801
So... if I told you
Tarr had recently arrived in Paris,

01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:58.716
would you be surprised?

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:01.009
No, nothing would surprise me
about Ricki Tarr.

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:05.890
And if I told you we happen to know
£30,000 mysteriously appeared

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:08.263
in his bank account last month,

01:07:08.399 --> 01:07:10.731
would that surprise you?

01:07:16.324 --> 01:07:18.986
Your man's a defector, Guillam.

01:07:19.118 --> 01:07:22.485
Turned by the opposition months ago
and now they've sent him back to us.

01:07:22.622 --> 01:07:25.409
- What for?
- Never mind what for.

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:28.079
To muddy the water,
that's what for.

01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:32.124
To spread a whole lot of damn
nonsense to get us chasing our tails.

01:07:32.257 --> 01:07:33.667
The point is this.

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:35.381
He's heading for home.

01:07:36.553 --> 01:07:38.635
The first peep from him,
you come to the grown-ups.

01:07:38.763 --> 01:07:40.469
Understood?

01:07:40.598 --> 01:07:44.136
Anyone you see around this table
but not another damn soul.

01:07:47.021 --> 01:07:48.557
Get out.

01:07:56.030 --> 01:07:57.395
Peter?

01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:04.610
Thank you, Belinda.

01:08:10.295 --> 01:08:12.035
# Oh, Mr Wu

01:08:12.171 --> 01:08:13.911
# What shall I do?

01:08:19.178 --> 01:08:21.169
# Oh, Mr Wu

01:08:21.305 --> 01:08:23.091
# What shall I do?

01:08:23.224 --> 01:08:24.760
# Mr Wu... #

01:08:33.443 --> 01:08:35.399
All go smoothly, did it?

01:08:35.528 --> 01:08:37.314
I need to go to the hotel
to see George.

01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:40.439
Mr Smiley isn't at the hotel, sir.
Change of venue.

01:08:52.337 --> 01:08:53.827
George?

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:04.256
Mr Guillam...

01:09:05.433 --> 01:09:07.424
Sorry it took me so long
to come home.

01:09:19.363 --> 01:09:21.446
Ricki has been helping us, Peter.

01:09:21.573 --> 01:09:24.657
He's been telling us
all about his adventures.

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:27.694
He's a double, George.

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:30.787
There is no mole. Whole thing's
been thought up by Moscow.

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:33.158
Karla bought him for £30,000.

01:09:33.294 --> 01:09:36.161
I stole that because of you.

01:09:36.296 --> 01:09:39.881
I spied on my own because of him.
Do you know how that makes me feel?

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:41.249
Ricki...

01:09:41.386 --> 01:09:45.004
you said you sent the Circus a telegram
concerning Irina's information.

01:09:45.139 --> 01:09:47.050
- That's right.
- What was the date?

01:09:47.183 --> 01:09:49.174
He doesn't know
because there was no telegram.

01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:52.801
- The whole thing is a fabrication.
- 20th November.

01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:56.022
It must have been 20th November.
Evening.

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:58.687
Irina kept telling me
in Moscow Centre

01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:01.357
everybody on the top floor
was laughing themselves sick.

01:10:01.489 --> 01:10:05.232
- She told me Karla...
- November 20th is missing.

01:10:05.368 --> 01:10:09.361
Someone is covering their tracks,
unless of course you think

01:10:09.497 --> 01:10:11.362
that's just a coincidence?

01:10:15.503 --> 01:10:17.084
What about the money?

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:21.081
30,000 isn't so much for Karla
to pay if it protects his mole.

01:10:22.719 --> 01:10:26.507
I'm afraid someone in the Circus
knows all about Mr Tarr

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:30.597
and is doing everything they can
to discredit him.

01:10:30.727 --> 01:10:34.140
...everything the Circus thinks
is gold is shit, made in Moscow.

01:10:38.735 --> 01:10:42.728
Why didn't you tell me
that you had Tarr?

01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:49.571
In case I never made it
out of the Circus.

01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:56.783
I suppose you've got your reading to do.

01:10:58.254 --> 01:10:59.835
Come up.

01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:13.799
I met him once.

01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:16.761
Karla.

01:11:18.441 --> 01:11:19.806
In 55.

01:11:22.987 --> 01:11:25.273
Moscow Centre was in pieces.

01:11:27.408 --> 01:11:30.491
Purge after purge.

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:32.986
Half their agents were jumping ship.

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:36.664
I travelled around, signing them up.

01:11:38.252 --> 01:11:39.662
Hundreds of them.

01:11:43.382 --> 01:11:46.169
One of them
was calling himself Gerstmann.

01:11:47.094 --> 01:11:49.335
He was on his way back to Russia

01:11:49.472 --> 01:11:52.930
and we were pretty sure
he was going to be executed.

01:11:53.059 --> 01:11:57.553
Plane had a 24-hour lay-over at Delhi
and that's how long I had

01:11:57.688 --> 01:12:00.805
to convince him to come over to us

01:12:00.942 --> 01:12:03.024
instead of going home to die.

01:12:08.658 --> 01:12:10.489
There's a little room.

01:12:13.037 --> 01:12:16.621
I'm sitting here. He's sitting there.

01:12:21.212 --> 01:12:24.670
The Americans had had him tortured.

01:12:28.761 --> 01:12:30.843
He had no fingernails.

01:12:34.559 --> 01:12:36.675
It's incredibly hot.

01:12:41.065 --> 01:12:45.525
I'm very tired and all I want to do
is get this over with and get back home.

01:12:48.364 --> 01:12:50.855
Things weren't going well with Ann.

01:12:54.745 --> 01:12:56.451
I give him the usual pitch.

01:12:56.581 --> 01:13:00.665
"Come to the West
and we can give you a comfortable life,

01:13:01.878 --> 01:13:03.709
"after questioning. "

01:13:07.717 --> 01:13:09.548
What did he say?

01:13:14.682 --> 01:13:16.513
"Think of your wife.

01:13:19.186 --> 01:13:21.347
"You have a wife, don't you?

01:13:24.817 --> 01:13:27.729
"Here. I brought you some cigarettes,
by the way.

01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:33.569
"Use my lighter.

01:13:38.789 --> 01:13:43.954
"We could arrange for her to join you.
We have a lot of stock to trade.

01:13:45.796 --> 01:13:49.163
"If you go back, she'll be ostracised.
Think of her.

01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:51.006
"Think about... "

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:57.255
I kept on...

01:13:58.643 --> 01:14:00.975
...harping on about the damn wife,

01:14:03.522 --> 01:14:05.604
telling him more about me than...

01:14:09.195 --> 01:14:11.277
I should have walked out, of course.

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:23.532
"We're not so very different you and I.

01:14:25.211 --> 01:14:26.826
"We've both spent our lives

01:14:26.963 --> 01:14:30.296
"looking for the weaknesses
in one another's systems.

01:14:33.552 --> 01:14:35.668
"Don't you think it's time to recognise

01:14:35.805 --> 01:14:40.265
"there is as little worth on your side
as there is on mine?"

01:14:53.364 --> 01:14:55.480
Never said a word.

01:15:01.998 --> 01:15:03.829
Not one word.

01:15:13.009 --> 01:15:15.716
And the next morning
he got back on his plane.

01:15:17.221 --> 01:15:20.008
He handed the pack of cigarettes
back to me, untouched.

01:15:20.141 --> 01:15:24.180
This was a chain-smoker, mind.

01:15:24.311 --> 01:15:28.520
And he flew off to what
he presumed would be his death.

01:15:32.319 --> 01:15:34.230
He kept my lighter.

01:15:38.117 --> 01:15:39.823
It was a gift.

01:15:42.079 --> 01:15:44.161
"To George from Ann.

01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:48.449
"All my love. "

01:15:51.672 --> 01:15:53.287
That was Karla.

01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:58.258
He went back to die
rather than giving in.

01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:03.882
Yes, and that's how I know
he can be beaten.

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:10.062
Because he's a fanatic.

01:16:11.734 --> 01:16:15.477
And the fanatic is always
concealing a secret doubt.

01:16:21.285 --> 01:16:22.900
What did he look like?

01:16:25.164 --> 01:16:27.120
I can't remember.

01:16:48.771 --> 01:16:50.887
After today, Peter,

01:16:52.316 --> 01:16:54.773
you have to assume
they're watching you.

01:17:00.407 --> 01:17:02.693
If there's anything you need tidied up,

01:17:07.164 --> 01:17:09.029
now is the time.

01:17:23.514 --> 01:17:25.129
Nearly done.

01:17:26.517 --> 01:17:28.223
For God's sake.

01:17:32.148 --> 01:17:35.561
Sometimes I think they're all
sharing the same moronic brain.

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:48.861
If there's someone else,
you can tell me.

01:17:51.458 --> 01:17:53.244
I'm a grown-up.

01:18:30.039 --> 01:18:34.453
I know. It's just going to be
such a wonderful Christmas.

01:18:34.585 --> 01:18:36.075
Excuse me.

01:18:43.594 --> 01:18:47.633
# And I was too proud to give in

01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:58.227
# I had to learn the hard way

01:19:00.527 --> 01:19:02.563
- # That pride... #
- Peter, when you're ready

01:19:02.696 --> 01:19:04.106
Put it on now.

01:19:07.159 --> 01:19:08.569
Everybody!

01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:25.692
- Jerry.
- George.

01:20:26.947 --> 01:20:28.312
- Peter.
- Jerry.

01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:32.400
I need to talk to you.

01:20:32.536 --> 01:20:35.118
About the night Jim Prideaux was killed.

01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:39.122
You were duty officer, weren't you?

01:20:39.793 --> 01:20:43.706
Yeah. Control asked me
to man the phones that night.

01:20:44.798 --> 01:20:47.631
He said someone was doing
a special job for the service.

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:49.546
He wanted someone he could trust.

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:54.467
Hurricane Henry set
to be ridden by Ray Walsh at 7:2...

01:21:27.049 --> 01:21:28.789
There's been a bit of a panic, sir.

01:21:30.803 --> 01:21:33.340
This is from the FO resident clerk.

01:21:33.472 --> 01:21:35.963
A Hungarian news bulletin.

01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:38.261
"British spy, work name Ellis,

01:21:38.394 --> 01:21:40.555
"travelling with false Hungarian papers,

01:21:40.687 --> 01:21:45.397
"has attempted to kidnap an unnamed
Hungarian General in Budapest.

01:21:46.485 --> 01:21:48.476
"He's been shot.

01:21:48.612 --> 01:21:50.694
"Other arrests imminent. "

01:21:54.451 --> 01:21:56.533
Can I have a brief, please?

01:21:59.289 --> 01:22:01.871
Sir? Do you want me to deny it, sir?

01:22:10.342 --> 01:22:12.799
I couldn't get a word out of Control.

01:22:12.928 --> 01:22:16.045
So I followed protocol
and went for the emergency list.

01:22:19.268 --> 01:22:21.350
You rang my house.

01:22:21.478 --> 01:22:23.969
Just on the off-chance
you were back from Berlin.

01:22:24.106 --> 01:22:25.516
What did you say?

01:22:26.442 --> 01:22:28.524
- Hello?
- Hello, Mrs Smiley.

01:22:28.652 --> 01:22:30.734
It's Jerry.
Jerry Westerby from the office.

01:22:30.863 --> 01:22:33.149
Just that there'd been a bit of a crisis.

01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:35.364
Ann said you wasn't back yet
and that was it.

01:22:36.577 --> 01:22:37.657
Go on.

01:22:37.786 --> 01:22:39.322
All hell broke loose.

01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:41.912
Military yelling about
Hungarian tanks on the border.

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:44.656
Lacon and the minister
baying at the door.

01:22:45.544 --> 01:22:48.251
Thank Christ
Bill Haydon turned up when he did.

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:49.586
- Mr Haydon.
- Not now.

01:22:49.715 --> 01:22:51.080
Mr Haydon!

01:22:52.634 --> 01:22:53.623
Out!

01:22:55.554 --> 01:22:57.340
- Tell me.
- I tried to get hold of you.

01:22:57.473 --> 01:23:00.636
I got half a story
on the ticker tape at my club. Tell me.

01:23:01.852 --> 01:23:03.717
Jim Prideaux's been shot.

01:23:08.317 --> 01:23:10.182
Get me the Hungarian embassy.

01:23:10.319 --> 01:23:12.150
You tell your masters what will happen

01:23:12.279 --> 01:23:14.144
if one hair on Jim Prideaux's head
is damaged.

01:23:14.281 --> 01:23:17.193
Get Esterhase on the phone.
Tell him to call in the Hungarian agents.

01:23:17.326 --> 01:23:18.315
Yes, sir.

01:23:30.422 --> 01:23:32.959
Any more news on him? Sir?

01:23:37.930 --> 01:23:39.386
Oh, God.

01:23:39.515 --> 01:23:42.177
We need to get down to his flat,
clear out anything linked.

01:24:24.476 --> 01:24:27.468
Haydon heard the news at his club?

01:24:29.022 --> 01:24:31.934
At 1:30? The ticker-tape
wouldn't have been running.

01:24:32.067 --> 01:24:33.773
So how did he know?

01:24:35.404 --> 01:24:36.860
- Jesus, George.
- Peter!

01:24:36.989 --> 01:24:39.526
- How could he have known?
- It's not what you think.

01:24:39.658 --> 01:24:43.571
- Then how did he know?
- He was at my house that night.

01:25:13.692 --> 01:25:15.774
Good flight?

01:25:18.488 --> 01:25:20.399
Yes.

01:25:20.532 --> 01:25:22.488
Pleasant enough.

01:25:22.618 --> 01:25:24.483
I was just passing.
I thought I'd call in.

01:25:25.412 --> 01:25:28.654
Ann was in bed.
She insisted on getting up.

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:31.031
She said she'd be down in a minute.

01:25:32.794 --> 01:25:36.332
That's what I'm dropping off.
It's an awful daub really.

01:25:38.050 --> 01:25:40.336
But Ann expressed a liking.

01:25:43.347 --> 01:25:45.303
What's keeping her?

01:26:01.948 --> 01:26:03.358
Keep going.

01:26:04.534 --> 01:26:06.650
Come on, lads. Keep up.

01:26:09.581 --> 01:26:11.367
Come on, Bill!

01:26:24.513 --> 01:26:27.175
- Got your specs on, Jumbo?
- Yes, sir.

01:26:27.307 --> 01:26:28.922
Come here.

01:26:35.399 --> 01:26:37.515
Who's that fellow down there?

01:26:39.152 --> 01:26:41.393
I don't know, sir.

01:26:41.530 --> 01:26:43.566
Who is he?

01:26:43.699 --> 01:26:45.564
Beggar man?

01:26:45.701 --> 01:26:47.157
Thief?

01:26:48.787 --> 01:26:51.403
Why doesn't he look this way, hm?

01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:55.374
Wouldn't you if you saw a bunch
of boys flogging a car round a field?

01:26:56.545 --> 01:26:59.912
What's the matter with him?
Doesn't he like us?

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:03.085
I don't hold with odd-bods
hanging around.

01:27:03.218 --> 01:27:05.800
He might steal the Alvis.

01:27:05.929 --> 01:27:08.215
- Which is?
- The best car in England, sir.

01:27:11.852 --> 01:27:13.433
Good lad.

01:27:22.821 --> 01:27:26.814
How were you briefed
for the Budapest mission?

01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:29.987
Control asked me
to come to a flat in Kensington.

01:27:32.581 --> 01:27:35.197
There's a rotten apple, Jim.

01:27:37.210 --> 01:27:39.246
And we have to find it.

01:27:41.256 --> 01:27:44.464
What did you make of it, Jim?

01:27:44.593 --> 01:27:46.584
Control's theory?

01:27:48.096 --> 01:27:50.712
I thought it was madness.

01:27:50.849 --> 01:27:55.263
I know that it is one of five men.

01:27:56.813 --> 01:28:00.601
All I want from you is one code name.

01:28:07.616 --> 01:28:09.026
Alleline.

01:28:11.286 --> 01:28:12.901
Tinker.

01:28:13.622 --> 01:28:15.078
Haydon.

01:28:16.833 --> 01:28:18.448
Tailor.

01:28:20.128 --> 01:28:21.618
Bland.

01:28:24.132 --> 01:28:25.622
Soldier.

01:28:27.052 --> 01:28:29.885
We drop Sailor.
It's too close to Tailor.

01:28:30.013 --> 01:28:32.174
And Rich Man doesn't seem
to be applicable.

01:28:34.226 --> 01:28:35.682
Esterhase.

01:28:37.646 --> 01:28:39.887
Poor Man.

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:46.935
And the fifth?

01:28:49.241 --> 01:28:50.731
Smiley.

01:28:54.663 --> 01:28:56.699
I thought it was madness.

01:28:58.124 --> 01:29:01.241
To think that any one of you
could have been a traitor.

01:29:02.838 --> 01:29:04.499
Absolute madness.

01:29:06.508 --> 01:29:09.341
But you still went.

01:29:09.469 --> 01:29:11.585
Why?

01:29:11.721 --> 01:29:14.884
I went
because Control asked me to go.

01:29:15.016 --> 01:29:17.507
It's called doing one's duty.

01:29:28.655 --> 01:29:33.524
At the station I met the legman
supposed to take me to the General.

01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:35.651
The waiter must have panicked.

01:29:35.787 --> 01:29:37.698
It was meant to be
a simple snatch job.

01:29:44.379 --> 01:29:46.995
They drove me
to some military hospital,

01:29:47.132 --> 01:29:49.919
and then put me on a transport plane.

01:29:50.051 --> 01:29:52.337
I could tell by the stars
we were heading east.

01:29:56.892 --> 01:29:58.928
Then they worked me for...

01:30:01.271 --> 01:30:03.762
...I don't know how long.

01:30:03.899 --> 01:30:06.106
Weeks, maybe months.

01:30:46.441 --> 01:30:48.227
What did you tell them?

01:30:49.778 --> 01:30:51.359
Everything.

01:30:53.657 --> 01:30:57.616
I held on for as long as I could to let
everyone get the hell out of there.

01:30:59.788 --> 01:31:01.198
Did they?

01:31:02.374 --> 01:31:05.161
My networks in Hungary,
did they get out?

01:31:07.963 --> 01:31:09.999
No, they were blown.

01:31:12.217 --> 01:31:15.880
The story is you blew them
to save your own skin.

01:31:23.436 --> 01:31:28.430
After the interrogators had cleared out,
this little fellow turned up.

01:31:30.485 --> 01:31:32.441
Looked like a priest.

01:31:33.989 --> 01:31:36.321
That's when they really started on me.

01:31:36.449 --> 01:31:40.067
What was your last line of defence, hm?

01:31:41.663 --> 01:31:43.324
The mole.

01:31:44.708 --> 01:31:46.824
Control's crazy theory.

01:31:48.878 --> 01:31:52.416
I was going to bury that so deep
they'd never get it out of me.

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:57.209
- Which was a joke.
- Why?

01:31:58.888 --> 01:32:01.254
Because they already knew.

01:32:01.391 --> 01:32:04.929
All they wanted to know was how far
Control had got in his investigation.

01:32:20.702 --> 01:32:22.488
No, I don't know her.

01:32:42.974 --> 01:32:46.091
Did they ask about me at all?

01:32:46.227 --> 01:32:47.717
Yes.

01:32:48.730 --> 01:32:50.721
The little fellow did.

01:32:52.984 --> 01:32:55.896
What did he say about me?

01:32:57.489 --> 01:32:59.730
He had this cigarette lighter.

01:33:01.159 --> 01:33:03.901
He kept flashing it about
for me to see it.

01:33:05.163 --> 01:33:07.404
Showed me the inscription.

01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:09.747
- "To George... "
- ... from Ann.

01:33:11.211 --> 01:33:12.917
"All my love. "

01:33:18.802 --> 01:33:20.258
Karla.

01:33:51.126 --> 01:33:53.162
It was odd.

01:33:54.629 --> 01:33:57.211
They sent me back to England.

01:33:57.340 --> 01:33:59.922
Straight to Sarratt for debriefing.

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:07.714
He said when he was being debriefed
at the Nursery, he had a visitor.

01:34:07.851 --> 01:34:09.011
Who?

01:34:09.144 --> 01:34:12.011
Toby Esterhase.

01:34:12.147 --> 01:34:14.809
He gave him £1,000 and an Alvis.

01:34:15.859 --> 01:34:19.192
Told him he was dead now.
Couldn't come back.

01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:22.812
Had to become a lotus eater,
forget everything that happened.

01:34:22.949 --> 01:34:24.814
Control's theory.

01:34:24.951 --> 01:34:27.158
Tinker, Tailor. All of it.

01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:31.196
Yes, that's what I thought.

01:34:31.332 --> 01:34:35.621
How on earth did Esterhase
hear about Tinker, Tailor?

01:34:52.228 --> 01:34:54.435
Irina kept telling me
in Moscow Centre

01:34:54.564 --> 01:34:57.897
everybody on the top floor
was laughing themselves sick.

01:34:58.026 --> 01:35:00.438
She told me
Karla was very proud of this.

01:35:00.570 --> 01:35:03.778
She said everything the Circus thinks
is gold is shit, made in Moscow.

01:35:09.412 --> 01:35:11.528
Irina kept telling me
in Moscow Centre

01:35:11.664 --> 01:35:14.576
everybody on the top floor
was laughing themselves sick.

01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:17.917
No, I had a hotel nearby.
They do have some seedy rooms.

01:35:18.046 --> 01:35:20.082
Irina kept telling me in Moscow Centre

01:35:20.215 --> 01:35:23.753
everybody on the top floor
was laughing themselves sick.

01:35:23.885 --> 01:35:25.796
She told me
Karla was very proud of this...

01:36:02.423 --> 01:36:04.835
She said everything
the Circus thinks is gold is shit.

01:36:35.123 --> 01:36:38.331
This meeting is not taking place.
Is that clear?

01:36:39.502 --> 01:36:41.117
Perfectly, Minister.

01:36:45.967 --> 01:36:51.007
There is a house
somewhere in this city

01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:55.849
where Alleline and the others meet
Witchcraft's London representative.

01:36:55.977 --> 01:36:58.093
I thought Lacon had made it
clear to you.

01:36:58.229 --> 01:37:01.847
Keep your nose bloody well
out of Witchcraft's business.

01:37:01.983 --> 01:37:03.814
It's Lacon's advice I'm following.

01:37:03.943 --> 01:37:06.525
You told me
to follow in Control's footsteps.

01:37:06.654 --> 01:37:11.318
I wouldn't consider that sound advice,
given the mess Control left us with.

01:37:12.452 --> 01:37:16.661
It has taken Alleline
and, if I may say so, myself

01:37:16.789 --> 01:37:18.825
this long to get us back in the game.

01:37:20.001 --> 01:37:23.960
The man Alleline and the others
meet is called Polyakov.

01:37:29.469 --> 01:37:31.551
From Witchcraft to you.

01:37:31.679 --> 01:37:36.548
His real role is to receive
information from the mole

01:37:36.684 --> 01:37:38.265
to take back to Karla.

01:37:39.645 --> 01:37:43.058
That, er...
That's not possible.

01:37:43.191 --> 01:37:44.806
Made possible.

01:37:44.942 --> 01:37:48.355
By you in the house you persuaded
the Treasury to pay for.

01:37:49.238 --> 01:37:54.449
Witchcraft's intelligence is genuine.
It's been gold.

01:37:54.577 --> 01:37:58.866
It's just enough glitter
amongst the chicken feed.

01:37:58.998 --> 01:38:01.865
Control didn't believe in miracles
or in Witchcraft.

01:38:02.001 --> 01:38:03.741
But you were lazy and greedy

01:38:03.878 --> 01:38:07.962
and so you hounded him
out of the Circus and you let Karla in.

01:38:10.676 --> 01:38:14.885
You opened negotiations to exchange
intelligence with the Americans.

01:38:15.014 --> 01:38:18.677
What they tell the Circus,
they'll be telling the Kremlin.

01:38:18.810 --> 01:38:24.271
Witchcraft's information,
the "gold" Karla let you have,

01:38:24.399 --> 01:38:26.515
it wasn't to lure you.

01:38:26.651 --> 01:38:28.892
It was to lure the Americans.

01:38:31.072 --> 01:38:32.778
Now,

01:38:32.907 --> 01:38:35.023
do you want to take credit for that?

01:38:39.539 --> 01:38:41.404
What can we do?

01:38:43.835 --> 01:38:47.623
We have one thing the mole wants.

01:38:50.842 --> 01:38:52.173
- If I go to Paris...
- You'll go.

01:38:52.301 --> 01:38:55.088
If I go to Paris,

01:38:56.848 --> 01:38:59.339
I want your word
that you will get Irina back.

01:39:00.893 --> 01:39:04.477
I don't care who you have to trade.
And I am out.

01:39:07.024 --> 01:39:11.313
I want a family, thank you.
I do not want to end up like you lot.

01:39:11.446 --> 01:39:13.732
You will get her back.

01:39:16.617 --> 01:39:19.108
I'll do my utmost, Ricki.

01:39:44.145 --> 01:39:46.261
Oh, hello, George.

01:39:47.398 --> 01:39:48.854
Hello.

01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:17.212
I want to talk about loyalty, Toby.

01:40:20.223 --> 01:40:23.215
Control recruited you, didn't he?

01:40:23.351 --> 01:40:26.514
Found you starving
in a museum in Vienna.

01:40:26.646 --> 01:40:29.183
A wanted man.

01:40:29.315 --> 01:40:31.351
Saved your life, I heard.

01:40:32.527 --> 01:40:34.643
And yet when the time came,

01:40:34.779 --> 01:40:37.191
when it came to picking sides
between him and Alleline,

01:40:37.323 --> 01:40:39.234
you didn't hesitate.

01:40:40.326 --> 01:40:44.035
That's understandable, perhaps,
with your war experience.

01:40:44.163 --> 01:40:48.907
You survived this long, I suppose,
because of your ability to change sides.

01:40:49.043 --> 01:40:51.125
Serve any master.

01:40:56.759 --> 01:40:59.466
What? What's...
What's this about, George?

01:41:00.555 --> 01:41:03.797
It's about which master
you've been serving, Toby.

01:41:07.812 --> 01:41:10.428
Intelligence
has been leaked, Toby.

01:41:10.565 --> 01:41:13.432
Someone's been taking files
from the Circus.

01:41:13.568 --> 01:41:15.775
No, no, no, no. No.

01:41:15.903 --> 01:41:17.643
This is a mistake, a misunderstanding.

01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:21.238
Files were delivered
to a Russian attaché, weren't they?

01:41:21.367 --> 01:41:22.482
Yes.

01:41:24.370 --> 01:41:27.032
And, yes, I delivered them.

01:41:32.587 --> 01:41:34.828
But so did Percy Alleline.

01:41:39.719 --> 01:41:40.959
Good boy.

01:41:41.095 --> 01:41:43.211
Bill Haydon.

01:41:44.974 --> 01:41:47.056
And so did Roy Bland.

01:41:56.861 --> 01:41:59.352
Things aren't always
what they seem, George.

01:41:59.488 --> 01:42:01.479
You should know that.

01:42:01.616 --> 01:42:04.028
Look, Moscow thinks Polyakov's...

01:42:08.247 --> 01:42:10.283
...working for them.

01:42:10.416 --> 01:42:12.907
Every now and then we give him
the odd file to take back to them.

01:42:13.044 --> 01:42:15.456
Chicken feed,
just to keep his bosses happy.

01:42:17.882 --> 01:42:21.124
But Polyakov's our Joe.

01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:24.969
- He's a part of a big operation.
- Operation Witchcraft.

01:42:25.931 --> 01:42:27.467
Yes, I know.

01:42:28.476 --> 01:42:30.091
George.

01:42:30.227 --> 01:42:33.014
- Please, I don't deserve this.
- Who gave you the message

01:42:33.147 --> 01:42:35.889
for Jim Prideaux
to forget about Tinker, Tailor?

01:42:36.025 --> 01:42:38.357
- Bland.
- To get rid of Connie Sachs?

01:42:38.486 --> 01:42:40.192
- Westerby?
- Bland.

01:42:40.321 --> 01:42:42.528
Or Haydon.

01:42:42.657 --> 01:42:44.488
I don't know. One of them.

01:42:45.701 --> 01:42:47.566
Or maybe Percy. No.

01:42:47.703 --> 01:42:50.410
Well, I don't know who.

01:42:50.539 --> 01:42:52.746
You're just the messenger.

01:42:53.834 --> 01:42:56.450
Running between them all.

01:42:56.587 --> 01:42:59.044
Anything to serve Witchcraft.

01:43:00.341 --> 01:43:02.707
I know all about your secret source.

01:43:04.512 --> 01:43:06.548
And I know something you don't.

01:43:08.557 --> 01:43:10.718
I know who he is.

01:43:13.104 --> 01:43:15.186
He's Karla.

01:43:22.947 --> 01:43:27.361
One of you has been giving
Polyakov the crown jewels.

01:43:27.493 --> 01:43:30.610
- I did not know.
- Are you still a wanted man, Toby?

01:43:30.746 --> 01:43:34.614
- Look, George, I didn't know. I...
- You picked the wrong side.

01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:36.615
No, you've got to believe me.

01:43:36.752 --> 01:43:39.084
George, please.

01:43:43.217 --> 01:43:45.378
I am loyal.

01:43:46.137 --> 01:43:48.503
I... I am loyal.

01:43:59.567 --> 01:44:01.979
Don't... Don't...
Don't send me back.

01:44:02.111 --> 01:44:03.976
Please, George.

01:44:04.864 --> 01:44:06.604
Don't send me back.

01:44:12.121 --> 01:44:14.203
Give me the address.

01:44:17.418 --> 01:44:19.830
Where do you meet Polyakov?

01:44:33.392 --> 01:44:35.758
Hey, hey!
Dog, dog, be quiet!

01:44:36.854 --> 01:44:39.641
What is this? Who are you?

01:44:57.374 --> 01:44:59.786
- What are the safety signals?
- The air vent.

01:44:59.919 --> 01:45:02.285
Open and all's well,
closed and you're not to enter.

01:45:05.883 --> 01:45:08.169
And the microphone?

01:45:15.100 --> 01:45:16.465
Peter?

01:45:33.077 --> 01:45:36.069
The boy stood on the burning deck
whence all but he had fled

01:45:36.205 --> 01:45:38.662
The flame that lit the battle's wreck
shone brightly over the dead

01:45:39.625 --> 01:45:42.992
Beautiful and proud he stood
as born to rule the storm

01:45:43.128 --> 01:45:46.370
A creature of blood,
a proud though child-like form

01:45:46.507 --> 01:45:49.169
The flames rolled on...

01:46:00.354 --> 01:46:03.266
Merci. Au revoir.

01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:37.971
Go on.

01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:47.891
The whole service is looking for you.

01:46:48.027 --> 01:46:51.394
- They'll skin you alive if they find you.
- Maybe I want them to find me.

01:46:53.115 --> 01:46:56.278
You can go now. Leave the books
and put the keys in the machines.

01:46:56.410 --> 01:46:59.072
No, Ben stays here.

01:46:59.204 --> 01:47:04.574
Ricki Tarr claims to have information
vital to the safeguarding of the Circus.

01:47:26.857 --> 01:47:28.768
Mr Smiley?

01:47:31.236 --> 01:47:32.601
Taxi approaching Circus.

01:47:45.042 --> 01:47:46.452
Tinker.

01:47:57.388 --> 01:47:59.174
Tailor.

01:48:04.478 --> 01:48:06.218
Here comes Soldier.

01:48:10.985 --> 01:48:12.600
Full house.

01:48:25.416 --> 01:48:31.207
- Well, go on then. Read it out loud.
- Personal for Tarr from Alleline.

01:48:32.339 --> 01:48:36.673
Require clarification
before meeting your request.

01:48:37.803 --> 01:48:43.844
Quote, information vital
to safeguarding of the Circus, unquote

01:48:45.144 --> 01:48:49.387
"does not qualify,
send further information. "

01:48:49.523 --> 01:48:52.606
Ah! That's it, Percy,
you keep stalling.

01:48:52.735 --> 01:48:55.568
I warn you, Ben. We've got
some really lousy people in this outfit.

01:48:55.696 --> 01:48:57.937
I wouldn't trust a fucking one of them.

01:49:05.873 --> 01:49:08.034
The meeting's over.

01:49:10.461 --> 01:49:12.372
They're leaving.

01:53:13.745 --> 01:53:15.952
Craddox says I'll be off in a few days.

01:53:17.749 --> 01:53:21.492
I keep thinking how much
I'm going to miss the cricket in Moscow.

01:53:28.218 --> 01:53:32.678
I was rather hoping you might do
a little light housekeeping for me.

01:53:34.474 --> 01:53:36.135
If I can.

01:53:36.893 --> 01:53:41.478
There's a girl.
Give her some money, would you?

01:53:41.606 --> 01:53:43.813
And give her a good cover story.

01:53:46.028 --> 01:53:48.861
If it helps, tell her I love her.

01:53:48.989 --> 01:53:50.695
It's all there.

01:53:50.824 --> 01:53:54.908
And there's a boy, too.
Slip him a few quid to shut him up.

01:53:57.247 --> 01:54:01.331
I know the inquisitors bag of tricks.
I taught most of them.

01:54:03.962 --> 01:54:05.998
It's just a reaction.

01:54:07.966 --> 01:54:10.503
An over-reaction, if you like.

01:54:10.635 --> 01:54:13.342
I did have one or two questions.

01:54:17.184 --> 01:54:19.049
- About Prideaux.
- Goddamn it!

01:54:19.186 --> 01:54:22.098
- I got him back, didn't I?
- Yes, yes, you did.

01:54:25.275 --> 01:54:28.517
I am surprised
Karla didn't have him shot.

01:54:30.030 --> 01:54:32.817
Or do you think he held back,

01:54:32.949 --> 01:54:35.531
out of delicacy towards you?

01:54:39.206 --> 01:54:43.825
Did Prideaux come and see you
before he left on the Hungarian mission?

01:54:46.380 --> 01:54:48.712
Yes, as a matter of fact he did.

01:54:51.385 --> 01:54:53.376
To say what?

01:54:58.850 --> 01:55:00.715
To warn you.

01:55:02.646 --> 01:55:05.228
Because he knew deep down

01:55:06.441 --> 01:55:08.397
it was you all along.

01:55:12.906 --> 01:55:15.192
So did you.

01:55:19.204 --> 01:55:21.616
I had to pick a side, George.

01:55:23.291 --> 01:55:26.579
It was an aesthetic choice
as much as a moral one.

01:55:27.921 --> 01:55:31.004
And the West has become
so very ugly.

01:55:32.134 --> 01:55:33.874
Don't you think?

01:55:35.595 --> 01:55:39.179
Did Karla ever consider
having you take over the Circus?

01:55:39.307 --> 01:55:41.639
I'm not his bloody office boy!

01:55:41.768 --> 01:55:44.259
What are you, then, Bill?

01:55:50.902 --> 01:55:53.143
I'm someone who's made his mark.

01:56:06.918 --> 01:56:11.582
Is there anything particular
you want me to pass on to Ann?

01:56:15.343 --> 01:56:19.837
Oh, that was nothing personal, George.
I hope you understand that.

01:56:19.973 --> 01:56:22.339
Karla said you were good,

01:56:22.476 --> 01:56:25.593
the one we had to worry about.

01:56:25.729 --> 01:56:29.187
But you do have a blind spot.

01:56:29.316 --> 01:56:31.682
He reck oned
if I was known to be Ann's lover,

01:56:33.069 --> 01:56:36.061
you wouldn't be able to see me straight.

01:56:37.657 --> 01:56:39.522
And he was right.

01:56:40.952 --> 01:56:42.908
Up to a point.

01:56:46.416 --> 01:56:48.156
Up to a point.

01:57:15.403 --> 01:57:17.359
I made this for you, sir.

01:57:26.164 --> 01:57:29.247
I don't want you
hanging around here any more.

01:57:31.044 --> 01:57:33.251
Keep away from me from now on.

01:57:34.673 --> 01:57:37.255
- Go and join the others.
- But...

01:57:37.384 --> 01:57:40.251
Just... Just bloody join in, will you?

01:57:43.974 --> 01:57:46.556
Go and play, damn you!

01:58:04.035 --> 01:58:06.697
Could you check, Jerry?
