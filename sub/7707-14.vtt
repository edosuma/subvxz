WEBVTT

00:01.902 --> 00:05.104
Remember, Kate,
I like my waffles crisp

00:05.106 --> 00:07.006
yet<i> al dente.</i>

00:07.008 --> 00:08.841
Cooked to a golden amber

00:08.843 --> 00:14.013
and served piping hot
on a gently warmed plate.

00:18.085 --> 00:20.219
How does she do it?

00:21.555 --> 00:24.223
Do you want
some maple syrup, ALF?

00:24.225 --> 00:27.693
On waffles? How gauche.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.695
Get me the garlic salt?

00:31.565 --> 00:34.767
Guess what?
The car won't start again.

00:34.769 --> 00:38.037
- You just got it fixed.
- Three times in two weeks.

00:38.039 --> 00:42.341
Every time they fix one thing,
something else goes wrong.

00:42.343 --> 00:43.842
Well, I don't get it.

00:43.844 --> 00:45.377
Why keep spending money
on something

00:45.379 --> 00:48.747
that doesn't work and causes
nothing but aggravation?

00:48.749 --> 00:51.216
Somehow we've gotten used to it.

00:51.852 --> 00:52.885
[burps]

00:52.887 --> 00:54.286
Sort of.

00:54.955 --> 00:56.422
Speaking of aggravation

00:56.424 --> 00:58.690
we're out of garlic salt.

00:59.560 --> 01:00.392
[knocking on door]

01:00.394 --> 01:01.727
(Trevor)
'Hey, Tanners!'

01:01.729 --> 01:03.128
'Guess who?'

01:03.130 --> 01:04.363
Let me take a stab.

01:04.365 --> 01:06.698
It's the wacky
next-door neighbor.

01:09.637 --> 01:11.303
Come on in, Trevor.

01:11.305 --> 01:12.538
[Trevor whistling]

01:12.540 --> 01:15.808
Hi, Willie. Hi, Kate.
Hi, kids.

01:15.810 --> 01:17.342
- Hi.
- Hi, Trevor.

01:17.344 --> 01:20.079
I just stopped by to see if
you needed a ride to work again.

01:20.081 --> 01:23.649
Well, as a matter of fact, I do.
Uh, my car won't start again.

01:23.651 --> 01:26.452
Ah. You should let Jake
take a look at it.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.287
Kid could fix anything,
has my car

01:28.289 --> 01:31.056
running like Florence Joyner.

01:31.058 --> 01:33.859
Oh, by the way,
uh, Jake will be doing

01:33.861 --> 01:36.261
the driving this morning.
I hope you don't mind.

01:36.263 --> 01:37.996
I didn't know Jake could drive.

01:37.998 --> 01:39.665
He can't.

01:39.667 --> 01:41.100
I think I mind.

01:41.102 --> 01:42.901
He just got
his learner's permit.

01:42.903 --> 01:44.937
I'm teachin' him.
Kid's a natural.

01:44.939 --> 01:48.740
Five days he's been driving,
hasn't hit a living thing.

01:48.742 --> 01:51.944
We'll bring the car out front.

01:51.946 --> 01:55.447
(ALF)
'Yo, Lynn,
you could use a pedicure.'

01:55.449 --> 01:56.648
'Ow!'

01:57.685 --> 02:00.686
[theme music]

02:28.415 --> 02:31.617
[music continues]

02:59.280 --> 03:01.747
[instrumental music]

03:04.451 --> 03:05.918
[horn honks]
Ow!

03:05.920 --> 03:07.586
Horn works.

03:09.089 --> 03:10.622
Thank you.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.224
Why don't we just
kill this thing

03:12.226 --> 03:13.659
for the insurance money?

03:13.661 --> 03:16.195
We'll make it look
like an accident.

03:18.465 --> 03:22.134
- Oh, hello, Jake.
- Hi, Mr. Tanner. Hey, ALF.

03:22.136 --> 03:24.303
What brings you over,
Jake-Speare?

03:24.305 --> 03:26.605
Aunt Raquel and Uncle Trevor
are showing slides

03:26.607 --> 03:29.274
from their trip
to Carlsbad Caverns.

03:29.276 --> 03:31.376
All 400 of 'em.

03:31.378 --> 03:35.314
I've seen those,
216 stalactites

03:35.316 --> 03:37.249
184 stalagmites.

03:37.251 --> 03:39.017
Those are the ones.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.986
Still having car trouble, huh?

03:40.988 --> 03:42.721
Yeah, but have no fear.

03:42.723 --> 03:46.291
It's being handled
by Mr. No Good Wrench.

03:46.293 --> 03:49.861
- You mind if I take a look?
- Be my guest.

03:49.863 --> 03:52.431
I got a hunch
it's the distributor.

03:52.433 --> 03:55.133
Well, that rules out
the distributor.

03:55.135 --> 03:58.303
No, here's your problem.
It's the spark plug wire.

03:58.305 --> 04:00.439
I'll have it fixed in no time.

04:00.441 --> 04:03.775
[chuckles]
Well, thanks, Jake.

04:03.777 --> 04:06.845
- Don't be embarrassed, Willie.
- Oh, I'm not embarrassed.

04:06.847 --> 04:09.915
- Not everybody can fix things.
- No, I'm not embarrassed.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.084
I'm sure there are several
things you could do that Jake--

04:12.086 --> 04:13.986
I'm not embarrassed.

04:15.489 --> 04:18.423
Okay, Mr. Tanner,
start her up when I say now.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.261
[car door opens]

04:22.263 --> 04:23.295
Okay, now.

04:23.297 --> 04:25.597
[engine starts]

04:27.067 --> 04:29.301
Now are you embarrassed?

04:31.405 --> 04:34.006
Jake, what can I say?

04:34.008 --> 04:35.574
Thank you.

04:35.576 --> 04:38.443
You never thank me
when I humiliate you.

04:40.981 --> 04:43.515
You know, I can't be sure,
but it looks like

04:43.517 --> 04:45.584
somebody cut that wire
on purpose

04:45.586 --> 04:48.654
then just patched it together
real loose.

04:48.656 --> 04:52.324
Has anybody been
under the hood lately?

04:54.528 --> 04:57.596
Don't look at me.
I just honk the horn.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.599
Well, I have been taking the car

05:00.601 --> 05:02.434
to a new mechanic lately,
but I--

05:02.436 --> 05:05.871
There's your problem!
The guy's a crook!

05:05.873 --> 05:09.174
Oh, ALF, don't jump
to conclusions like--

05:09.176 --> 05:11.009
No, I saw it on "60 Minutes."

05:11.011 --> 05:14.046
These mechanics fix one thing,
then they break something else

05:14.048 --> 05:15.714
so you keep coming back.

05:15.716 --> 05:17.849
You know,
ALF could be right, Mr. Tanner.

05:17.851 --> 05:22.421
I've heard of that scam, too,
on that David Horowitz show.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.589
Well, why don't I just
give the garage a call?

05:24.591 --> 05:26.525
There must be
a simple explanation

05:26.527 --> 05:28.327
for this broken wire.

05:28.329 --> 05:31.463
Yeah, you got took, conned

05:31.465 --> 05:33.565
nicked and clipped.

05:33.567 --> 05:36.935
You got your horn swoggled
and your flim flammed.

05:39.907 --> 05:43.408
Hello, Sam,
it's Willie Tanner here. Uh..

05:43.410 --> 05:45.977
Yes, it's nice to hear
your voice again, too.

05:45.979 --> 05:47.746
Uh, listen, Sam,
I wonder if you noticed

05:47.748 --> 05:52.417
anything unusual about my car,
uh, engine wise, I mean.

05:52.419 --> 05:55.587
Uh, like, say, uh, severed wire.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.856
You crook!
This is Mike Wallace!

05:57.858 --> 06:00.892
- You're under arrest!
- ALF, shh!

06:00.894 --> 06:03.962
No, I'm not accusing you,
but it is possible, you kn--

06:03.964 --> 06:06.064
Not that I'm accusing you,
mind..

06:06.066 --> 06:07.899
But-but you understand..

06:09.336 --> 06:11.169
That's not an accusation.

06:11.171 --> 06:12.504
If memory serves

06:12.506 --> 06:17.008
Bob Newhart is much funnier
doing his phone bit.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.778
Well, I guess we have nothing
more to say to one another.

06:21.482 --> 06:24.015
You know, I'm beginning to think
you may be right.

06:24.017 --> 06:26.418
I'm gonna call
the Better Business Bureau.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.920
Have them throw the book
at this guy.

06:28.922 --> 06:31.990
Preferably something
by James Michener.

06:33.293 --> 06:36.495
[instrumental music]

06:39.633 --> 06:41.800
Uh, hello,
Department of Consumer Affairs?

06:41.802 --> 06:44.636
T-the Better Business Bureau
told me to call you.

06:44.638 --> 06:46.505
My name is Willie Tanner,
I'm a consumer

06:46.507 --> 06:48.407
and I have a complaint.

06:48.409 --> 06:51.143
Yes, I'll hold.

06:51.145 --> 06:54.112
Have you busted that crook yet?

06:54.114 --> 06:56.982
We don't know that
he's a crook. It's possible..

06:56.984 --> 07:00.919
Yes. Uh, my name
is Willie Tanner. I..

07:00.921 --> 07:02.287
Yes, I'll hold.

07:02.289 --> 07:04.523
On Melmac we had an expression.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.725
There's a sucker born
every month

07:06.727 --> 07:09.694
except February which has 28.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.564
I suppose
you'd handle this differently.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.733
Indubitably, Willie-nilly.

07:14.735 --> 07:17.335
I'd dial 1-800-CRIME-88

07:17.337 --> 07:20.872
let the FOX Network blow this
thug right out of the water.

07:22.075 --> 07:25.377
ALF, why must you always..

07:25.379 --> 07:27.646
Yes! My name is..

07:28.148 --> 07:29.815
I'll hold.

07:29.817 --> 07:32.150
You've got him
running scared now.

07:33.520 --> 07:36.521
As much as I appreciate
your counsel

07:36.523 --> 07:38.490
I prefer to handle this
my own way.

07:38.492 --> 07:40.625
Thank you very much.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.294
Don't you have something to do?

07:42.296 --> 07:44.129
Yeah, but it can wait.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.899
Hello? Hello! Now hear this.

07:47.901 --> 07:50.168
I'm a consumer,
I have a complaint

07:50.170 --> 07:52.904
I will not be put on hold.

07:52.906 --> 07:55.240
Yes, thank you.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.677
I'm going to call back later.

08:00.514 --> 08:03.715
[instrumental music]

08:05.285 --> 08:06.785
What did you get?

08:06.787 --> 08:10.989
Fourteen, twenty five,
twenty nine.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.657
What did I get?

08:12.659 --> 08:16.094
Oil can, cabinet door
and a box.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.196
I win.

08:18.198 --> 08:20.499
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, B.

08:20.501 --> 08:21.800
Did your dad have any luck

08:21.802 --> 08:23.502
proving that mechanic
ripped him off?

08:23.504 --> 08:26.137
He called six people about it
so far.

08:26.139 --> 08:29.808
The man's a tiger
when he's irked.

08:29.810 --> 08:32.377
Do you know what I'd do
if I were him?

08:32.379 --> 08:35.447
Rethink your fashion viewpoint?

08:35.449 --> 08:38.917
I'd con those conmen right back.

08:38.919 --> 08:42.120
Well, that's not Willie's style.
You know him.

08:42.122 --> 08:44.589
He's nice. He's polite.

08:44.591 --> 08:46.324
He's a pigeon.

08:46.326 --> 08:49.794
- We've gotta help him.
- How?

08:49.796 --> 08:52.130
We'll need to use
your uncle's car.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.432
What for?

08:54.434 --> 08:56.701
I haven't gotten that far yet.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.670
I can't drive alone.

08:58.672 --> 09:00.972
I've only got
a learner's permit, remember?

09:00.974 --> 09:04.409
We'll trick Lynn
into helping us.

09:04.411 --> 09:06.645
I-I-I don't know.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.480
Can I help, too?

09:08.482 --> 09:09.548
Well, you could
stick by the phone

09:09.550 --> 09:11.016
in case we need to check in.

09:11.018 --> 09:14.119
- We'll give you a code name.
- Like what?

09:14.121 --> 09:16.187
How about B?

09:16.189 --> 09:18.156
People always call me B.

09:18.158 --> 09:20.592
How about B-plus?

09:20.594 --> 09:23.194
Okay, but I'm doing this
under protest.

09:23.196 --> 09:26.898
One more thing.
This is our secret signal.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.705
Use your fingers if you have to.

09:36.777 --> 09:39.978
[instrumental music]

09:41.515 --> 09:43.648
So do you think I have a case?

09:43.650 --> 09:47.519
W-well, thank you,
Mr. Assistant District Attorney.

09:47.521 --> 09:49.521
Okay, Howard.

09:49.523 --> 09:52.190
Uh, so when do you think
we'll go to court?

09:53.060 --> 09:53.892
I see.

09:53.894 --> 09:54.993
Well, when do you think

09:54.995 --> 09:58.129
we'll have
the preliminary hearing?

09:58.131 --> 10:03.001
I see. Then, when do you think
we can file the complaint?

10:04.504 --> 10:06.171
I see.

10:06.173 --> 10:08.807
When do you think
you'll be back from Aspen?

10:09.543 --> 10:11.576
(Willie)
Goodbye.

10:11.578 --> 10:12.744
[knocking on door]

10:12.746 --> 10:13.778
(Jake)
'It's me. Jake.'

10:13.780 --> 10:15.647
Oh, hi, Jake. Come on in.

10:15.649 --> 10:17.215
[door opening]

10:17.217 --> 10:21.286
Oh, hi, Mrs. Tanner.
Mr. Tanner.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.755
Is, uh.. Is..

10:23.757 --> 10:26.224
Is, uh, is Lynn around?

10:26.226 --> 10:28.994
Well, yes. She's, uh, she's,
she's in the other room. Why?

10:28.996 --> 10:31.529
[chuckles]
No reason, yeah,
I-I just thought

10:31.531 --> 10:32.931
since I was
in the neighborhood..

10:32.933 --> 10:36.167
I mean, you know me.
I'm always botherin' her. Yeah.

10:36.169 --> 10:39.738
It-it doesn't mean anything.
I'll grow out of it.

10:40.641 --> 10:44.042
- Lynn, hi.
- Jake. Bye.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.277
- Wait a second.
- Make it fast.

10:46.279 --> 10:49.147
I've got something really
important to do in my room.

10:49.149 --> 10:52.617
- Like what?
- Wait for tomorrow.

10:52.619 --> 10:55.820
- I-I got a favor to ask you.
- What?

10:55.822 --> 10:58.823
I need a ride someplace
to get somethin' for somebody.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.725
- It-it's real important.
- I'm sorry, Jake.

11:00.727 --> 11:03.762
I'd like to help you, but mom's
taking the car to go shopping.

11:03.764 --> 11:06.931
- We can take my uncle's car.
- The Duster?

11:06.933 --> 11:09.300
It won't take long,
and it's not far.

11:09.302 --> 11:11.236
And we can wait till it's dark,
so none of your friends

11:11.238 --> 11:12.937
will see you with me.

11:13.907 --> 11:16.741
Okay, but only
under these conditions.

11:16.743 --> 11:18.309
Anything you want.

11:18.311 --> 11:22.414
For a period of one month,
no innuendo.

11:22.416 --> 11:24.649
- No innuendo.
- 'No leering.'

11:24.651 --> 11:25.817
No leering.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.485
And no referring to me

11:27.487 --> 11:30.388
as honey, doll or mama.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.057
You got it, babe.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.860
No babe.

11:35.862 --> 11:38.763
No babe. No babe.

11:40.267 --> 11:43.768
Don't you think you're following
a little too closely?

11:43.770 --> 11:46.705
No. But thanks for your input.

11:46.707 --> 11:50.341
- Ten and two.
- Excuse me?

11:50.343 --> 11:51.943
Your hands should be
at ten o'clock

11:51.945 --> 11:54.079
and two o'clock on the wheel.

11:54.081 --> 11:58.083
I'm sorry, my right hand
is running a little fast today.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.651
Alright.
Get in the right lane here.

11:59.653 --> 12:01.953
Alright.

12:01.955 --> 12:05.557
You should always remember
to check your blind spot.

12:05.559 --> 12:08.326
If you don't shut up,
I'll give you a blind spot.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.662
Eyes on the road!
Eyes on the road!

12:10.664 --> 12:11.896
Where? Where?

12:11.898 --> 12:13.431
[screaming]

12:19.773 --> 12:22.574
ALF, what are you doing
in this car?

12:22.576 --> 12:25.777
Enjoying your witty repartee.

12:25.779 --> 12:28.012
I knew
I shouldn't have agreed to this.

12:28.014 --> 12:29.180
I wouldn't have asked you
to do this

12:29.182 --> 12:30.815
unless it was real important.

12:30.817 --> 12:33.118
Whatever it is,
I don't wanna be involved.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.854
I'm sorry, Lynn,
it's way too late.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.655
You're in too deep.

12:37.657 --> 12:40.425
You know too much.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.527
What are you talking about?

12:42.529 --> 12:46.164
Welcome to operation Sam Scam.

12:48.902 --> 12:52.103
[instrumental music]

12:53.740 --> 12:55.874
[instrumental music]

12:56.943 --> 12:59.844
That's the plan.
Will you help us?

12:59.846 --> 13:02.981
Please?
Please, please, please?

13:02.983 --> 13:05.517
Come on, Lynn, we need somebody
who's responsible

13:05.519 --> 13:06.951
somebody who's reliable.

13:06.953 --> 13:10.588
Somebody who'll suck the fun
right out of this.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.891
In short, a leader.

13:12.893 --> 13:15.393
Do it for truth, justice

13:15.395 --> 13:18.096
and the Melmacian way.

13:18.098 --> 13:20.832
You mean the American way.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.133
No, Melmacian.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.836
It was the motto
of Melmac's superhero

13:24.838 --> 13:27.305
Supercilious!

13:27.307 --> 13:29.107
Supercilious?

13:29.109 --> 13:31.276
Yeah. He captured
a lot of criminals.

13:31.278 --> 13:34.179
But he was so darned smug
about it.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.881
So, you with us?

13:36.883 --> 13:38.583
[sighs]

13:38.585 --> 13:42.854
ALF, it's too dangerous for you
to be out here like this.

13:42.856 --> 13:44.689
Well, unless there was someone
who comes along

13:44.691 --> 13:47.158
to make sure
I stay out of trouble.

13:47.160 --> 13:50.428
- Know anyone like that?
- Uh..

13:50.430 --> 13:52.063
I would like to see
one of these creeps

13:52.065 --> 13:54.299
get what he deserves, just once.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.367
Yeah? Yeah?

13:56.369 --> 13:58.036
You know, I should just
turn this car around

13:58.038 --> 13:59.971
and drive the two of you home.

13:59.973 --> 14:02.073
But you won't.

14:04.211 --> 14:05.944
- But I won't.
- Yeah!

14:05.946 --> 14:07.979
Sam Scam! Sam Scam!

14:07.981 --> 14:10.048
(both)
Sam Scam! Sam Scam!

14:10.050 --> 14:13.251
[instrumental music]

14:15.555 --> 14:18.189
Now, you're sure your uncle's
car is in good shape?

14:18.191 --> 14:20.592
I went over it myself
from top to bottom.

14:20.594 --> 14:22.994
- It's perfect.
- Great.

14:22.996 --> 14:25.864
Okay, here's what we'll do.
ALF, you stay here.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.265
Lynn and I go inside
and tell the guy

14:27.267 --> 14:29.300
the car broke down
on the way to our honeymoon.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.002
[sighs]
No, here's what we'll do.

14:31.004 --> 14:33.037
Jake, you stay out here.
Keep an eye on ALF.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.073
I'll take the car inside.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.841
Okay. I'll run the camera.

14:36.843 --> 14:39.577
No! I'm the director.

14:39.579 --> 14:42.380
- Then I'll be the producer.
- Oh, great.

14:42.382 --> 14:46.751
Now I'm gonna have this money
man on my back the whole time.

14:46.753 --> 14:49.053
Don't stifle me creatively.

14:51.691 --> 14:54.893
[engine revving]

14:56.696 --> 14:58.062
[car door opens]

14:58.064 --> 14:59.464
[car door shuts]

14:59.466 --> 15:00.732
Uh, good evening.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.300
- What can I do for you?
- Hello.

15:02.302 --> 15:03.835
(Lynn)
'Are you Sam?'

15:03.837 --> 15:05.470
That's what they sewed
on my pocket.

15:05.472 --> 15:09.107
[chuckles]
My car has been giving me
problems.

15:09.109 --> 15:11.542
My engine's been making
funny noises.

15:11.544 --> 15:16.347
Mm. And what kind
of funny noises might those be?

15:16.349 --> 15:19.050
You know, like,
when your earrings

15:19.052 --> 15:21.920
fall in the garbage disposal.

15:21.922 --> 15:25.490
Of course.
Let's have a look-see.

15:25.492 --> 15:26.557
[clanking]

15:27.928 --> 15:30.962
Or should I say, a hear-listen?
Ha-ha!

15:33.500 --> 15:36.067
[instrumental music]

15:36.069 --> 15:37.936
(Willie)
'Hello, Congressman Burdick?'

15:37.938 --> 15:40.104
I have reason to believe
that I've been defrauded

15:40.106 --> 15:41.940
by a car repair shop.

15:41.942 --> 15:43.441
Now, I've been referred to every

15:43.443 --> 15:45.176
agency and bureau
in the phone book.

15:45.178 --> 15:47.512
I've even spoken to
the Department of Fish and Game

15:47.514 --> 15:49.681
because somebody thought I was
having trouble with my carp.

15:49.683 --> 15:51.282
[knocking on door]

15:52.352 --> 15:54.652
- Just a moment, please.
- Hi, Willie.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.955
I'm talking to Congressman
Burdick's office, Trevor.

15:56.957 --> 15:58.790
[chuckles]
That crook?

15:58.792 --> 16:01.159
You better watch your wallet.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.995
Look here,
I-I almost voted for this man.

16:03.997 --> 16:08.166
I pay his salary,
and I-I-I want action!

16:08.168 --> 16:10.134
And I'll hold.

16:10.136 --> 16:12.337
Hey, Willie, have you seen Jake?

16:12.339 --> 16:14.005
No. Why?

16:14.007 --> 16:15.974
Well, we come home, and no Jake.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.642
Our Duster's missing, too.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.510
Well, you don't think
Jake took the car?

16:19.512 --> 16:23.848
Nah. Raquel probably left it
someplace again.

16:23.850 --> 16:25.283
Well, let me know
if you see Jake, eh?

16:25.285 --> 16:27.752
- Will do.
- Hiya, Brian.

16:28.888 --> 16:30.154
You're still on the phone?

16:30.156 --> 16:32.490
I'm holding, actually. Why?

16:32.492 --> 16:36.361
Well, if anybody calls and asks
for B-plus, that's me.

16:36.363 --> 16:39.063
- Who calls you that?
- Jake.

16:39.065 --> 16:41.265
Trevor was just in here
looking for Jake.

16:41.267 --> 16:43.234
Do you know where he is?

16:43.236 --> 16:46.804
If I tell you, it could mess up
Operation Sam Scam.

16:46.806 --> 16:48.373
Brian..

16:49.442 --> 16:50.908
...if there's something going on

16:50.910 --> 16:53.277
called Operation Sam Scam

16:53.279 --> 16:56.647
then I think you should tell me
everything you know.

16:56.649 --> 16:58.116
I was sworn to secrecy.

16:58.118 --> 16:59.884
You should definitely tell me

16:59.886 --> 17:01.652
everything you know.

17:03.056 --> 17:04.589
Oh, okay.

17:04.591 --> 17:07.158
Jake and Lynn and ALF
took Mr. Ochmonek's car

17:07.160 --> 17:08.626
to your repair place.

17:08.628 --> 17:10.328
Why would the..

17:11.564 --> 17:12.930
And ALF?

17:12.932 --> 17:14.632
Yeah.

17:14.634 --> 17:17.969
Kate, I gotta go. I'm in
a big hurry. I can't explain.

17:17.971 --> 17:20.071
I'll be back as soon as I can.

17:20.073 --> 17:22.907
Say hi to ALF for me.

17:22.909 --> 17:26.110
[instrumental music]

17:28.248 --> 17:31.482
I'm afraid
I have unpleasant news.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.052
What's wrong?

17:34.054 --> 17:37.355
Bad carburetor
and faulty distributor.

17:37.357 --> 17:40.091
The procedure will run you $200.

17:40.093 --> 17:41.859
Two-hundred dollars?

17:41.861 --> 17:44.295
I don't have $200!

17:44.297 --> 17:46.297
Not exactly Meryl Streep

17:46.299 --> 17:49.300
but a nice touch of hysteria,
nonetheless.

17:51.137 --> 17:54.272
ALF, we-we-we got a problem.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.409
(Alf)
'Hi, Willie.'

17:59.446 --> 18:01.079
Willie?

18:01.081 --> 18:03.881
You think this is all
my idea, right?

18:03.883 --> 18:06.417
It's always your idea.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.252
I suppose you want details?

18:08.254 --> 18:10.421
[sighs]
Lots of them.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.790
The Ochmoneks' car is not broke

18:12.792 --> 18:14.625
and this joker wants to fix it.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.861
-<i> Capiche? </i>
- Really?

18:16.863 --> 18:20.231
Wait! Wait! I think
Lynn's going in for the kill.

18:20.233 --> 18:24.001
So, you're absolutely,
positively sure

18:24.003 --> 18:26.137
that this engine right here

18:26.139 --> 18:29.207
needs $200 in repairs?

18:29.209 --> 18:31.342
That's my diagnosis.

18:33.179 --> 18:34.979
Heard enough?

18:34.981 --> 18:36.380
Excuse me, will you?

18:36.382 --> 18:39.250
I'd like to have a word
with this quack.

18:39.252 --> 18:42.720
Oh, wait! You forgot to tell me
which is your good side.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.623
The one you're not on.

18:48.027 --> 18:51.195
ALF, can I look through
the camera for a while?

18:51.197 --> 18:55.266
Jake, baby, you handle
marketing and distribution.

18:55.268 --> 18:58.136
Let me lens this flick, okay?

19:00.707 --> 19:02.373
[hood thuds]

19:02.375 --> 19:06.344
Tanner, if you're here
with more accusations

19:06.346 --> 19:08.379
get off my property.

19:08.381 --> 19:11.449
- Dad, what are you doing here?
- Dad?

19:12.485 --> 19:15.386
- This is your daughter?
- Yes, it is.

19:15.388 --> 19:17.054
Sam was just explaining that--

19:17.056 --> 19:18.289
I-I-I was just telling her

19:18.291 --> 19:21.626
that everything
seems to be fine.

19:21.628 --> 19:26.297
He said this car needs
$200 in repairs.

19:26.299 --> 19:29.433
- Sam..
- I did not say that.

19:29.435 --> 19:31.302
Are you calling my daughter
a liar?

19:31.304 --> 19:34.238
I-I'm not calling anybody
anything.

19:35.441 --> 19:37.008
Why is it every time
I bring my car in here

19:37.010 --> 19:40.545
to get something fixed, I go out
with something else broken?

19:40.547 --> 19:42.480
I tell you what I'm gonna do.

19:42.482 --> 19:45.249
You bring your car down here
first thing tomorrow

19:45.251 --> 19:49.687
and I'll take care
of everything for 99.95.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.622
Mister, you're not gonna get
another penny out of me

19:51.624 --> 19:53.291
and if I have anything to say
about it, you're not gonna

19:53.293 --> 19:54.759
make another penny
in this neighborhood.

19:54.761 --> 19:57.528
No, no. No, no.
I'm taking a stand.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.930
This country was made great
by people

19:58.932 --> 20:01.566
who stood up for what
they believed in as Robert..

20:01.568 --> 20:04.302
If Willie starts humming "The
Battle Hymn Of The Republic"

20:04.304 --> 20:06.771
I'm pulling the plug
on this production.

20:08.241 --> 20:09.840
...I might expand on that

20:09.842 --> 20:12.343
'"No man is an island,
entire to himself."'

20:13.913 --> 20:16.781
[instrumental music]

20:16.783 --> 20:18.916
(Willie on TV)
'...and if I might expand
on that'

20:18.918 --> 20:21.652
"No man is an island,
entire to himself.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.387
"Every man is a piece
of the continent

20:23.389 --> 20:24.722
"a part of the main

20:24.724 --> 20:26.257
"and therefore,
never send to know

20:26.259 --> 20:27.491
"for whom the bell tolls.

20:27.493 --> 20:29.860
It tolls for thee!"

20:29.862 --> 20:32.230
Give me my money back!

20:33.399 --> 20:35.800
That was Willie Tanner,
a gutsy consumer

20:35.802 --> 20:40.238
who decided to fight back
and not let anyone rip him off.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.372
And here he is.

20:41.374 --> 20:44.575
[applauding]

20:47.614 --> 20:49.880
Welcome to "Fight Back,"
Willie.

20:51.284 --> 20:52.750
[applauds]
Way to go, Willie!

20:52.752 --> 20:55.553
- You tell him, dad.
- Alright!

20:55.555 --> 20:59.690
They left my best stuff
on the cutting room floor.

20:59.692 --> 21:02.460
Without your videotape, the
Department of Consumer Affairs

21:02.462 --> 21:04.829
might have never nailed
that rip-off artist.

21:04.831 --> 21:06.797
What would you say
to other consumers who felt

21:06.799 --> 21:10.801
they were being ripped off
and they wanted to fight back?

21:10.803 --> 21:12.503
Fight back.

21:14.774 --> 21:15.973
Very good, Willie.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.842
However, we at "Fight Back"
don't recommend

21:17.844 --> 21:20.911
that you attempt to videotape
the rip-off artist in action.

21:20.913 --> 21:24.582
You should start by calling the
Department of Consumer Affairs

21:24.584 --> 21:26.350
or the District Attorney's
office.

21:26.352 --> 21:29.654
And when all else fails,
call on your alien.

21:30.823 --> 21:34.158
When we come back,
microwave milkshakes.

21:34.160 --> 21:35.960
Have we really come to this?

21:35.962 --> 21:39.797
But first, a word from someone
brave enough to sponsor us.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.400
[applause on TV]

21:43.736 --> 21:47.438
I guess you know
what I'm going to say.

21:47.440 --> 21:50.708
You can't yell at me.
I did good.

21:50.710 --> 21:53.477
Well, yes, you did good.
I mean, well.

21:53.479 --> 21:56.414
But you shouldn't have done
what you did do.

21:56.416 --> 21:59.283
So you're saying
it's bad to do good?

21:59.285 --> 22:00.785
N-no.

22:00.787 --> 22:02.887
You're saying
if loving you is wrong

22:02.889 --> 22:05.456
I don't wanna be right?

22:05.458 --> 22:08.192
What we're saying is
it's wrong for you

22:08.194 --> 22:09.760
to put yourself in danger

22:09.762 --> 22:13.130
for something that I'm perfectly
capable of handling.

22:13.132 --> 22:15.433
We just don't want anything
to happen to you.

22:15.435 --> 22:18.202
- Yeah.
- Thanks, you guys.

22:18.204 --> 22:20.338
You, too, B-plus.

22:21.808 --> 22:24.709
Hey, I wonder if Horowitz
is gonna fight back

22:24.711 --> 22:27.478
against the guy
who sold him that suit.
