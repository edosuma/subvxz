00:09.110 --> 00:10.711

00:10.711 --> 00:11.412
YOU ARE EVIL!

00:11.412 --> 00:13.184
I'M THE SON
OF THE DEVIL.

00:18.189 --> 00:19.420
I'M NOT TAKING

00:41.572 --> 00:44.475
STEVE? YOU MADE IT!
YOU MADE IT TO HEAVEN.

00:44.475 --> 00:47.718
IT'S EVEN BETTER THAN CANCUN.

00:47.718 --> 00:49.520
THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

00:49.520 --> 00:50.621
I CANNOT GET
BEHIND THAT.

00:50.621 --> 00:51.482
COME ON, BEN!
HELP ME OUT HERE.

00:51.482 --> 00:53.053
I'M SORRY, MAN,
I'M WITH SOCK ON THIS ONE.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.155
I DON'T CARE.
I'M RIGHT ON THIS.

00:54.155 --> 00:56.087
IT'S NOT GAY TO BANG
A CLONE OF YOURSELF.

00:56.087 --> 00:59.090
IT IS ABSOLUTELY GAY
TO BANG A CLONE--

00:59.090 --> 01:00.291
HEY, GUYS!
HEY.

01:00.291 --> 01:01.792

A LITTLE PIZZA,
A LITTLE BUBBLY,

01:05.096 --> 01:07.198
A LITTLE...
SUITCASE.

01:07.198 --> 01:08.739
WHAT ARE WE
CELEBRATING?

01:08.739 --> 01:10.301
BEN DIDN'T TELL YOU?

01:10.301 --> 01:11.772
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.244
UH, TELL US WHAT?

THE DAY.

01:18.809 --> 01:21.112
WAIT, SOCK,
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

01:21.112 --> 01:23.584
I DON'T LIKE IT, BEN.
I DON'T LIKE IT
ONE LITTLE BIT.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.085
ALL RIGHT, HAVING
A LADY IN THE HOUSE

01:25.085 --> 01:26.187
OPENS THE WINDOW
TO LADY TROUBLE.

01:26.187 --> 01:28.789
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
WE'LL ALL BE ON
THE SAME CYCLE!

01:28.789 --> 01:29.820
SAM, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

01:29.820 --> 01:31.562
YOU KNOW,
TO BE HONEST, BEN,

01:31.562 --> 01:33.093
I DON'T THINK IT'S
SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.095
THANK YOU.
ARE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE

01:35.095 --> 01:37.428
BECAUSE OF THAT TIME
THAT I KISSED YOU?

01:37.428 --> 01:39.230
WHAT?!
WHAT?!

01:39.230 --> 01:41.372
YOU KISSED NINA?

01:41.872 --> 01:44.104
DAMN, MAN.

01:44.104 --> 01:44.635
OW!

01:44.635 --> 01:46.637
THAT WAS FOR YOU, BENJI.
THANK YOU!

01:46.637 --> 01:47.608
BABY, IT WASN'T
HIS FAULT.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.810
ACTUALLY, IT WAS ME.
I KISSED HIM.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.182
IT WAS
A LONG TIME AGO,

01:51.182 --> 01:53.384
AND I THOUGHT
THAT THERE WAS
SOMETHING EVIL

01:53.384 --> 01:55.216
ABOUT HIM THAT
I WAS EXTREMELY
ATTRACTED TO.

01:55.216 --> 01:59.690
BUT NOW, I REALIZE
THAT HE ISN'T
REMOTELY WICKED.

01:59.690 --> 02:00.421
THANK YOU.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.153
YOU'RE WELCOME.
I MEAN, LOOK AT HIM.

02:02.153 --> 02:04.755
HE'S--HE'S SO
WHITE BREAD.

02:04.755 --> 02:07.428
HE'S JUST BLAND,
AND HE'S--
BLAH.

02:07.428 --> 02:10.161
YES, HE'S BLAH.
EXACTLY.

02:10.161 --> 02:11.902
I AM NOT BLAH.

02:11.902 --> 02:13.133
YEAH.

02:13.133 --> 02:13.864
BABY, LISTEN TO ME.

02:13.864 --> 02:16.907
I'VE BEEN DOING
A TON OF WORK
ON MYSELF,

02:16.907 --> 02:19.210
AND I AM PROUD
TO SAY NOW

02:19.210 --> 02:21.672
THAT I CAN CONTROL
MY URGES.

02:21.672 --> 02:23.474
I'M ONLY JUST
A LITTLE BIT

02:23.474 --> 02:25.746
ATTRACTED
TO EVIL NOW.

02:25.746 --> 02:29.480
OK, I BELIEVE YOU.
LET'S MOVE PAST IT.

02:29.480 --> 02:31.582
All: REALLY?

02:31.582 --> 02:32.923
IT'S BEEN A WHILE,
BUT I GET IT.

02:32.923 --> 02:36.156
YOU'RE A DEMON,
AND CERTAIN THINGS
ARE JUST IN YOUR NATURE.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.460
YOU LIKE TO EAT LIVE ANIMALS,
MAKE OUT WITH MY FRIENDS,

02:39.460 --> 02:41.762
AND YOU HATE WEARING
SYNTHETIC FABRICS.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.394
I LIKE CLOTHES
THAT BREATHE.

02:43.394 --> 02:45.896
OK, NOW THAT
THIS IS OUT,

02:45.896 --> 02:47.268
ARE WE GOOD?

02:47.268 --> 02:48.869
I MEAN, CAN NINA STAY?

02:48.869 --> 02:50.841

NEVER COME HERE.
