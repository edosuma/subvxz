with the yellow snake.

- If you cross
the yellow snake,

00:12.971 --> 00:15.724
it sniff you out
and poison you, huh?

00:15.765 --> 00:16.891
- I know you're a Frías.

00:16.933 --> 00:18.768
- Because of this
horrible incident

00:18.810 --> 00:20.979
caused by this terrible
detective novel

00:21.021 --> 00:22.355
called "El Espejo,"

00:22.397 --> 00:25.191
I realized I could
no longer be a Frías.

00:25.233 --> 00:26.693
- Hey, who's Illán Iberra?

00:26.735 --> 00:28.862
- This book is about me.
- No, it isn't.

00:28.903 --> 00:30.405
- What is this?

00:30.447 --> 00:31.906
- It's just the directions
to the author's house.

00:31.948 --> 00:34.034
- I gotta go see that guy.

00:34.075 --> 00:35.285
- I'm starting
to understand everything.

00:35.326 --> 00:37.370
And I think there's still time
that I can help.

00:37.412 --> 00:38.496
Do not go to Pasaje.

00:38.538 --> 00:41.583
- Emma and I actually
lost a kid.

00:41.624 --> 00:43.335
And I never got to meet her.

00:43.376 --> 00:45.045
That seems cruel.

00:48.089 --> 00:50.550
- I don't know when I am...

00:50.592 --> 00:51.885
- I found that phone
in the jungle yesterday,

00:51.926 --> 00:53.011
and it doesn't even work.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.013
- When you are...

00:55.055 --> 00:57.223

and I put it in this one.

Illán Iberra.

04:26.641 --> 04:31.771
He has, uh, books on Amazon
for, like, 10¢ used.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.273
"Pasaje"...

04:33.314 --> 04:34.649
"Passage," right?
Passage to what?

04:34.691 --> 04:36.985
- Yeah, I can't watch
any more of this video.

04:37.027 --> 04:38.278
- Okay.

04:38.319 --> 04:39.779
All right, what if--
and I'm not--

04:39.821 --> 04:41.114
I'm not saying
that I believe this.

04:41.156 --> 04:43.408
But what if

04:43.450 --> 04:46.619
he put the phones there
on purpose

04:46.661 --> 04:49.622
because he knew that we would
be there, maybe,

04:49.664 --> 04:51.124
to, like, find them?
- What?

04:51.166 --> 04:52.125
- I don't know.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.918
- Guys, uh, I am afraid

04:53.960 --> 04:56.713
this is getting more unusual
than I was ever imagining.

04:56.755 --> 04:58.006
- Uh-huh.

04:58.048 --> 05:00.133
- If Sam and Violet were
looking for Illán Iberra,

05:00.175 --> 05:01.426
I think we should do the same.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.136
- Okay, but I can't find
anything on this guy.

05:03.178 --> 05:04.179
I mean, he's a full-on recluse.

05:04.220 --> 05:05.805
Just off the grid.
No phone number.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.891
No address. Nothing.
- Oh, no, he has an address.

05:07.932 --> 05:09.476
And I think I know
how to find him.

05:09.517 --> 05:10.602
- Oh, no shit?
- Yes.

05:10.643 --> 05:11.811
I think we need
to go to my house.

05:11.853 --> 05:13.646
We need to go to El Caracol.
- Yes, we do.

05:13.688 --> 05:16.316
[speaks Spanish]. Yeah.
- Oh, no, no, no, no way.

05:16.358 --> 05:17.650
You guys are all bananas,

of crazy nonsense,

05:20.528 --> 05:21.780

[indistinct conversation]

05:28.036 --> 05:30.288
- Okay, so

05:30.330 --> 05:32.374
what's up?

05:32.415 --> 05:34.084
This is, like,
our biggest break yet,

05:34.125 --> 05:36.252
and you haven't said a word
since we left the jungle.

05:36.294 --> 05:37.420
- Yeah, no, it's big.

05:37.462 --> 05:40.840
Yeah, I think, um--

05:40.882 --> 05:44.969

my brain around all of it.

06:21.923 --> 06:24.050
- That's when
I finally understood

06:24.092 --> 06:25.635
why everyone said that

06:25.677 --> 06:27.178
you shouldn't fuck
with the yellow snake.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.513
- Okay, so your family
does murder people?

06:28.555 --> 06:29.931
- No, no, no, no.

06:29.973 --> 06:34.394
My mother just had Iberra
removed from the university.

06:34.436 --> 06:36.563
And ruined his reputation.

06:36.604 --> 06:37.731
You don't need to kill people

06:37.772 --> 06:39.566
when you have influence,
you know?

06:39.607 --> 06:41.192
- You know,
I just gotta say, man,

06:41.234 --> 06:45.905
it kind of sounds like you were
a real prick as a little kid.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.657
- Oh, yes, I was. For sure.
[chuckles]

06:47.699 --> 06:48.908
- You didn't have to,
like, write this dude

06:48.950 --> 06:50.285
and tell him
that you hated his book.

06:50.326 --> 06:51.494
- Why not?

06:51.536 --> 06:53.788
My intention was not
to enrage him.

06:53.830 --> 06:56.207
My intention was to help him
to write something better,

06:56.249 --> 06:57.417
to become a better writer.

06:57.459 --> 06:59.294
But he just took it
like a big baby.

06:59.336 --> 07:00.754
- Was his next book any better?

07:00.795 --> 07:02.714
- I don't know, I never read
anything else from him.

07:02.756 --> 07:06.092

a very unexpected turn, no?

07:14.267 --> 07:16.144
- Hmm.

07:16.186 --> 07:18.938
Kind of an understatement.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.024
- Luna told me you had
an interesting conversation

07:21.066 --> 07:22.150
with her.

07:22.192 --> 07:24.110

07:24.152 --> 07:26.363
Oh, Luna sucks
at keeping secrets.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.448
You should be aware of that.

07:28.490 --> 07:31.284
And I have to say I'm truly
sorry you had to experience

07:31.326 --> 07:32.702
a loss like that.

07:32.744 --> 07:34.162
- Yeah, thanks.

07:34.204 --> 07:38.792
Um, I guess I just hadn't

07:38.833 --> 07:40.543
talked about it in a long time,

07:40.585 --> 07:43.129
and I guess I just
wanted to forget it.

07:43.171 --> 07:46.633
- Our past, our memory,
that's all we have.

07:46.675 --> 07:48.635
That's how you found the phone.

07:48.677 --> 07:50.553
- W--what?

07:50.595 --> 07:51.971
- Yeah.

07:52.013 --> 07:54.808
You allowed yourself to be
there, living the memory,

07:54.849 --> 07:58.895
and then you found the phone.

07:58.937 --> 08:00.563
- Yeah, dude,
that doesn't make any sense.

08:00.605 --> 08:01.815
- Oh, really?

08:01.856 --> 08:03.483
Do you have a better theory
than that?

08:03.525 --> 08:05.068
Why do you think
you found the phone?

08:05.110 --> 08:06.945
That second phone,
Violet's phone,

08:06.986 --> 08:09.114
that's a huge coincidence,
don't you think?

08:09.155 --> 08:10.990
- I don't know, there's--

08:11.032 --> 08:13.410
there is a lot of shit that
I don't understand right now.

08:13.451 --> 08:14.577
- Yeah.
- So...

08:14.619 --> 08:16.162
- Me neither.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.163
Do you mind taking--

08:17.205 --> 08:19.207
- Oh, yeah.

08:19.249 --> 08:24.170
* *

08:24.212 --> 08:26.172
- Listen, I--

08:26.214 --> 08:29.509
I have noticed that when
you allow yourself to open up

08:29.551 --> 08:33.763
and to remember,
to recognize

08:33.805 --> 08:37.726
the darker corners
of your subconscious,

08:37.767 --> 08:42.689
seemingly random pieces
fall into place, no?

08:42.731 --> 08:44.524
Like the "Tetris."

Some of the marble tile was
stolen from the Parthenon.

I would invite you in,
but I guess my brother is home,

09:25.106 --> 09:27.776
and he doesn't really
like tourists,

09:27.817 --> 09:29.235
or anyone, really.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.695
He's been trying to kill me
since he discovered

09:30.737 --> 09:32.530
that I'm better than him

09:32.572 --> 09:34.991
at everything in life.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.493
Okay.

09:36.534 --> 09:39.079
Stay in the van.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.163
I mean it.

by being here?

10:33.341 --> 10:35.343
- What do you mean?

10:35.385 --> 10:37.637
- Well, everyone told us not
to fuck with the yellow snake,

10:37.679 --> 10:42.642
and now we're sort of inside
of the yellow snake.

10:42.684 --> 10:43.852
- Yeah, but as guests.

10:43.893 --> 10:46.062
- [inhales sharply]
Yeah, I know,

10:46.104 --> 10:50.233
but why does he still
need us around, though?

10:50.275 --> 10:51.651
- Because we were
in the painting.

10:51.693 --> 10:54.863
- Well, we were in a painting
that he showed us.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.823
Think about it.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.450
And now he's...

10:58.491 --> 11:02.245
poking around
inside of our personal lives,

11:02.287 --> 11:05.165
and I don't--

11:05.206 --> 11:08.043
- Did something happen
in the jungle?

11:10.712 --> 11:13.089

12:48.226 --> 12:51.354
- I mean, do we really think
they came all the way out here?

12:54.566 --> 12:56.317
- Oh, my God.

12:56.359 --> 12:59.362
His house is as horrible
as his book.

12:59.404 --> 13:01.072
- So, uh,

13:01.114 --> 13:02.782
we don't think he actually

13:02.824 --> 13:04.909
did something
to the kids, right?

13:04.951 --> 13:06.036
- Well...

13:06.077 --> 13:07.871
- He marked his letters
in blood.

13:07.912 --> 13:09.205
- Yeah.

13:09.247 --> 13:11.416
I don't know if I feel

13:11.458 --> 13:16.004
scared or nervous
or guilty now.

13:16.046 --> 13:18.006
- You know what?
Maybe you should hang back.

13:18.048 --> 13:19.591
- What--
absolutely not.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.092
This is mine to finish, okay?

13:21.134 --> 13:22.552
And in this car, I--
I am the person

13:22.594 --> 13:24.179
who has done the most work
trying to solve this thing.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.306
- Well, okay,
but we found the phones.

13:26.348 --> 13:28.058
- Yeah, and I am the detective,

13:28.099 --> 13:29.184
and you're just
fucking tourists, okay?

13:29.225 --> 13:30.643
- Eh, aren't you a tailor?

13:30.685 --> 13:31.978
- [grunting]
- Stop!

13:32.020 --> 13:33.480
Hey! Stop!

13:33.521 --> 13:35.190
- Oh, I wish upon a star.
- Just calm down!

13:35.231 --> 13:36.441
- I wish upon a star.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.193
- Everyone, just fucking
stop freaking out!

13:38.234 --> 13:40.111
- Jesus fucking--
take that back.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.321
- No, I'm not taking
anything back.

13:41.363 --> 13:43.156
- You stop!
- Your mother is a tailor.

13:43.198 --> 13:45.617
- They're gonna hear you!
- You're a seamstress, bro.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.203
- Buenas noches.

13:49.579 --> 13:51.414

14:06.096 --> 14:07.597
- Hmm. Um...

14:17.607 --> 14:18.733

- I don't think
she's coming back, guys.

14:49.639 --> 14:52.767
- All right, that's 20.
That is 20 fucking bites.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.602
- You know, in--

14:54.644 --> 14:57.313
in some cultures,
the mosquito symbolizes

14:57.355 --> 14:59.441
discovery and persistence.

14:59.482 --> 15:01.693
- That's real sweet.
- Mm-hmm.

15:01.735 --> 15:04.070
- Well, that's 21.

16:13.264 --> 16:15.266
I was just trying
to ask you some questions!

16:19.562 --> 16:21.022
- What?

16:21.064 --> 16:22.023
- You speak English.

16:22.065 --> 16:23.650
- I know six languages.

16:23.692 --> 16:26.444
One I created myself.

16:38.081 --> 16:39.582
- Were they here?

16:45.547 --> 16:47.674
- You think
I did something to them?

16:50.010 --> 16:51.594
- Did you?

16:51.636 --> 16:53.221
- Maybe I did.

What? What?

17:07.110 --> 17:10.196
- [speaking Spanish]

17:12.115 --> 17:14.200
- What?
- You speak English?

17:14.242 --> 17:16.077
- Oh, not do I
only speak English,

17:16.119 --> 17:17.871
I speak six
different languages,

17:17.912 --> 17:20.248
two of which scholars
claim are extinct,

17:20.290 --> 17:22.667

Shoes take off.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.254
Shoes! Socks! Off! Now!

17:26.296 --> 17:27.797
Now! Now!
- Take off--

17:27.839 --> 17:29.674
- Do you want us to come in?
- Should we wait out here?

17:29.716 --> 17:31.176
- Are you--

17:32.469 --> 17:36.264
- There's a built-in cycle
that holds balance.

17:36.306 --> 17:39.059
Down there holds the key.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.727
Balance.

17:40.769 --> 17:43.355
Oh, hey, you want
to make yourselves useful?

17:43.396 --> 17:44.689
Come on, help. Grab that.
- Yeah, yeah, okay, okay.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.441
- Grab there.
Okay, all right.

17:46.483 --> 17:47.942
You won't see the horizon
from the center.

17:47.984 --> 17:49.277
- Uh-huh.

17:49.319 --> 17:51.488
- So once
you're in the whirlpool,

17:51.529 --> 17:52.906
you're stuck going around.

17:52.947 --> 17:54.824
Okay, don't let it go!
Whoa, whoa, don't let it go!

17:58.828 --> 18:00.789
- Maybe we can talk about this
a little bit later.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.043
- Yes! Oh, yes, yes!
- Hey, maybe you guys could

18:05.085 --> 18:06.878
do this a little bit later?
- I have the book, I have it.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.047
[gurgling]
- Oh! What the fuck is that?

18:09.089 --> 18:11.466

is the filth of time.

18:16.346 --> 18:18.890
Jarritos?
- Yeah.

18:22.477 --> 18:24.187
- Okay, gypsies, here you go.

18:24.229 --> 18:25.605
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

18:25.647 --> 18:27.023
- So what can I do for you?

18:27.065 --> 18:30.276
- [speaking Spanish]

18:30.318 --> 18:32.821
- Por favor, please,
stop speaking to me

18:32.862 --> 18:34.698
in that awful,
masticated Spanish.

18:34.739 --> 18:37.200
Talk to me in the language
of your President Jimmy Carter.

18:37.242 --> 18:38.493
He still is the president?

18:38.535 --> 18:40.328
- No, no, he's--
he's long dead.

18:40.370 --> 18:41.496
- No, he's actually
still alive.

18:41.538 --> 18:43.832
- A great man.
Crisis of Confidence.

18:43.873 --> 18:46.042
What's your crisis?

18:46.084 --> 18:48.253
- Well, señoro, um--

18:48.294 --> 18:49.504
gosh, it's been
such a long journey.

18:49.546 --> 18:51.131
I don't even know
where to start.

18:51.172 --> 18:54.384
Fuck, okay, I've been waiting
for this moment for months.

18:54.426 --> 18:56.386
Here, just--

18:58.596 --> 19:01.975
[suspenseful music]

19:02.017 --> 19:03.184
- These pages only hold

19:03.226 --> 19:06.896
the most painful years
of a man's life.

19:06.938 --> 19:09.357
It was my comeback,
my masterpiece.

19:09.399 --> 19:12.569
My name and career was sunk by
a family of fucking parasites.

19:12.610 --> 19:16.406
But that's a story
for another time.

19:16.448 --> 19:17.657
So what, you guys came
all the way out here

19:17.699 --> 19:19.200
to ask me for an autograph?

19:19.242 --> 19:23.246
- No.
Um, I came to find Pasaje.

19:26.583 --> 19:27.792
- Bring.

19:30.086 --> 19:34.090
* *

19:34.132 --> 19:35.425
- Who sent you here?

19:35.467 --> 19:37.844
* *

19:44.601 --> 19:47.937
- [muttering indistinctly]

19:50.482 --> 19:52.317
This is a sacrilege!

19:52.359 --> 19:53.943
Desecrating a book like this.

19:53.985 --> 19:55.945
Who does such a thing?

19:55.987 --> 19:57.655
- My mom.
- Does she thinks she could

19:57.697 --> 19:59.866
write better stories than me?

19:59.908 --> 20:01.951
She knows nothing! Nada!

20:01.993 --> 20:03.244
- Okay, you know what?

20:03.286 --> 20:07.415
We've come so far
and had a long, weird-ass day,

20:07.457 --> 20:08.667
all just to see you.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.335
- If she has so many opinions,

20:10.377 --> 20:12.837
why doesn't she write
her own damn book?

20:14.464 --> 20:15.632
- Violet, you want to--

20:15.674 --> 20:17.842
- Because she died
reading your book.

20:17.884 --> 20:20.470
- Are you implying that
my book killed your mother?

20:20.512 --> 20:21.805
Oh, no, no, no, no.

20:21.846 --> 20:25.100
- No, she believed
that you hid the location

20:25.141 --> 20:26.476
of Pasaje in this book.

20:26.518 --> 20:28.228
- What do you believe?

20:28.269 --> 20:29.437
- I need to find it.

20:29.479 --> 20:32.148
- Because you want
to see her again?

20:32.190 --> 20:34.984
- I'm only missing one piece.

20:35.026 --> 20:36.486
- What piece is that?

20:36.528 --> 20:39.447
[mysterious music]

20:39.489 --> 20:41.741
* *

20:41.783 --> 20:44.744
- I--I don't know
what that means.

20:44.786 --> 20:45.954
- Say it.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.292
- What?

20:51.334 --> 20:52.752
- Louder.

20:57.340 --> 20:59.050
- [chuckles]

21:01.177 --> 21:03.179
I mean, that can't be right.

21:03.221 --> 21:04.681
- Show me what you know.

21:04.723 --> 21:06.850
- So my mom figured out
that all these places

21:06.891 --> 21:08.643
that Alejandro investigates
in the book

21:08.685 --> 21:11.396
are actually real places
in the Yucatán Peninsula.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.898
Intemperie is actually Akumal.

21:13.940 --> 21:16.192
Abismos, Okap.

21:16.234 --> 21:18.153
Laguna Mental is Peto.

21:18.194 --> 21:22.365
And that makes Lluvia Atrasada
Espita.

21:22.407 --> 21:25.702
So all of these places
in your book

21:25.744 --> 21:27.620
are real places
in the peninsula,

21:27.662 --> 21:29.164
and they're all leading
to Pasaje,

21:29.205 --> 21:31.875
except I found all the spots
but the one

21:31.916 --> 21:33.918
for the entrance to the jungle.

21:37.422 --> 21:39.174
"With a backpack
and a bottle of water,

21:39.215 --> 21:40.925
"Alejandro walked through...

21:43.094 --> 21:44.220
In search of Pasaje."

21:44.262 --> 21:46.222
So what the fuck is that?

21:46.264 --> 21:47.432
Those aren't words.

21:47.474 --> 21:50.060
- [whispering]
It's my language.

21:50.101 --> 21:52.103
- Yeah, right.

21:54.939 --> 21:56.733
- It's different for everyone.

21:56.775 --> 22:00.904
You see, Pasaje baits you
by promising to transcend time.

22:00.945 --> 22:02.781
But that's a dangerous thing.

22:02.822 --> 22:06.284
We went to Pasaje in 1982,

22:06.326 --> 22:08.411
Alejandro and I.

22:08.453 --> 22:11.081
I got out.

22:11.122 --> 22:12.374
But him...

22:12.415 --> 22:13.750
I don't know.

22:13.792 --> 22:16.169
I never saw
my best friend again.

22:16.211 --> 22:17.128
- Where is it?

22:19.798 --> 22:21.508
- What if I told you

22:21.549 --> 22:24.177
that I wrote the book
as a warning,

22:24.219 --> 22:25.845
not as an invitation?

22:25.887 --> 22:28.682
- I would still ask,
where is it?

22:28.723 --> 22:31.309
- If it's all real,
what did you see in there?

22:31.351 --> 22:33.311
[eerie music]

22:33.353 --> 22:36.272
- It was such a long time ago,
it's all a dream now.

22:36.314 --> 22:40.026
- Yeah, but what did you see?

22:40.068 --> 22:41.695
- Read the book.

22:41.736 --> 22:43.196
- I--I don't have time.

22:43.238 --> 22:45.281
- You don't have time,
or you don't know how to read?

22:45.323 --> 22:47.117
- I know how to read.
- No, I read the book.

22:47.158 --> 22:48.785
- Then you know.

22:48.827 --> 22:52.497
- Yeah, but you didn't
actually describe it.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.209
- You never actually
went in, did you?

22:56.251 --> 23:03.174

23:06.219 --> 23:08.138
- You calling me a liar?

23:10.348 --> 23:11.266
- Yeah.

23:13.184 --> 23:14.686
I am.

23:16.187 --> 23:18.356
- Mm.

23:18.398 --> 23:20.650
I told them not to go.

23:20.692 --> 23:21.985
They wouldn't listen to me.

23:22.027 --> 23:25.697
So I dropped them off
at the jungle myself.

23:25.739 --> 23:27.741
I didn't know
there was a hurricane.

23:27.782 --> 23:29.242
They told me it
would be downgraded

23:29.284 --> 23:30.702
to a tropical depression.

23:30.744 --> 23:32.037
- Well, why the hell
didn't you tell anybody?

23:32.078 --> 23:33.455
- I forgot!

23:33.496 --> 23:35.206
- Jesus Christ.

23:35.248 --> 23:36.875
- This is bullshit.

23:37.625 --> 23:40.712

23:56.978 --> 23:59.689
- So how do you get there?

23:59.731 --> 24:02.025
- Were you not listening to me?

24:02.067 --> 24:05.362
- Pasaje is the villain
in the story.

24:05.403 --> 24:08.031
- Well, two kids are missing,
and their parents need answers.

24:08.073 --> 24:10.492
- Do you want to find the kids,
or do you want to find Pasaje?

24:10.533 --> 24:13.870

24:13.912 --> 24:15.663

I know how it ends now, yes.

25:07.382 --> 25:09.300
Okay, so now...

"Hunch", H, hach,

25:22.981 --> 25:25.316
the thread, the fence,

25:25.358 --> 25:29.320
the most divisive letter
in the English language.

25:29.362 --> 25:32.532
That's why it's the
first letter of my alphabet.

25:32.574 --> 25:34.576
[chuckles]

25:34.617 --> 25:36.286
Then there's umlaut.

25:36.327 --> 25:39.581
Who was the first
to say umlaut?

25:39.622 --> 25:41.750
- Germans.

25:41.791 --> 25:43.168
- No.
- Mm-hmm.

25:43.209 --> 25:44.127
- Phoenicians.

25:44.169 --> 25:45.462
- No.

25:45.503 --> 25:46.379
- Uh...
- Excuse me?

25:46.421 --> 25:47.422
- Sorry.

25:47.464 --> 25:48.965
- That's right.

25:49.007 --> 25:53.511
"Huncb" translates to "park."

25:53.553 --> 25:54.637
- Okay, so which park?

25:54.679 --> 25:56.681
- Now,

25:56.723 --> 26:00.518
"fo," say it like "wa."

26:00.560 --> 26:01.895
- Wa.
- Wa.

26:01.936 --> 26:03.104
- Can you just give us
the word, please?

26:03.146 --> 26:05.023
Because I really--
we really can't.

26:05.065 --> 26:08.109
We don't have time.

26:08.151 --> 26:11.488
- "Fo" translates to "de,"

26:11.529 --> 26:13.365
which translates to "of."

26:13.406 --> 26:15.367
- Oh, it's "of?"

26:15.408 --> 26:19.287
You just swapped the letters?
That's all you did?

26:19.329 --> 26:22.874
- This is why I can't
teach fools like you.

26:22.916 --> 26:25.543
Everybody thinks
they're a scholar.

26:25.585 --> 26:28.380
- Mm-hmm.

26:28.421 --> 26:29.881
- Okay, so now...

26:33.426 --> 26:35.679
Okay.

26:35.720 --> 26:38.890
[humming]

26:40.558 --> 26:42.811
No bueno, no bueno.

26:42.852 --> 26:44.312
A pen. Pen, please.

26:44.354 --> 26:45.605
I need a pen.

26:45.647 --> 26:48.775
[speaking Spanish]

26:51.861 --> 26:53.571
This can't be--

26:53.613 --> 26:56.199
no bueno, no bueno, no bueno.

26:56.241 --> 26:59.244
Okay, can I please have
one pen that writes?

26:59.285 --> 27:01.579
[speaks Spanish]
You want to know the answer?

27:01.621 --> 27:02.622
I need a pen.

27:02.664 --> 27:03.915
Can I get a pen, please?

27:03.957 --> 27:06.042
Find a pen! Let's go!
- Okay!

27:06.084 --> 27:09.004
- There's got to be one pen
in this forsaken house.

27:10.630 --> 27:12.132
That's my private drawer.

27:12.173 --> 27:13.174
One pen!
- All right, here we go.

27:13.216 --> 27:16.261
Here we go.
- Oh. Okay.

27:16.302 --> 27:18.221
That's not a pen. I need a pen!

27:18.263 --> 27:20.640
All my life,
and I can't find a pen.

27:20.682 --> 27:24.227
I need a pen that can write!

27:24.269 --> 27:25.937
[speaks Spanish]
- That's crazy.

27:25.979 --> 27:27.731
- Pen! Pen, please!
- This is--

27:27.772 --> 27:31.109
- I'd like to finish this,
explaining this to you.

27:31.151 --> 27:33.570
[speaks Spanish]
- This is getting dumb.

27:33.611 --> 27:35.321
No, aye.

27:35.363 --> 27:38.199
Pen! Pen! Pen, pen, pen, pen!
- Here, here, here, sir.

27:38.241 --> 27:39.325
- Pen!
- Try this.

27:39.367 --> 27:40.618
- Pen.

27:40.660 --> 27:42.454
[tense music]

27:42.495 --> 27:44.706
Nice pen.

27:44.748 --> 27:47.083
Ooh, I like that.
I like that. Okay.

27:47.125 --> 27:51.087
[speaking Spanish]

27:56.509 --> 27:58.636
This is a Frías pen.

27:58.678 --> 28:05.852
* *

28:10.940 --> 28:13.068
Who gave you this pen?

28:20.950 --> 28:23.286
- Baltasar

28:23.328 --> 28:24.621
Frías.

28:27.832 --> 28:31.419
You fucking snake.

28:31.461 --> 28:32.796
- [screaming]

28:32.837 --> 28:34.339
- Oh, my God!

28:34.381 --> 28:37.467
[all shouting]

28:39.469 --> 28:41.554
- [grunting]

28:41.596 --> 28:44.265
[all shouting]

28:47.227 --> 28:49.562
- No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, Papa!

28:52.440 --> 28:54.567
No, Papa!

28:54.609 --> 28:57.404
- How disappointing.

28:57.445 --> 28:59.406
[exhales]

28:59.447 --> 29:01.032
- [screaming]

29:01.074 --> 29:04.202
[all screaming]

29:06.746 --> 29:07.914
- Mmm.

29:10.083 --> 29:11.376
- This is all my fault.

29:11.418 --> 29:12.877
- It's nobody's fault, man.

29:12.919 --> 29:15.714
- No, it is,
because I wrote a letter

29:15.755 --> 29:18.800
to the man that started
a series of events

29:18.842 --> 29:20.260
that ended up in death.

29:20.301 --> 29:23.638
- Come on, you give yourself
too much credit.

29:23.680 --> 29:24.889
What happened happened.

29:24.931 --> 29:28.018
And now, you have to do
the right thing.

29:28.059 --> 29:30.562
- Yes.

29:30.603 --> 29:32.564
Yes, I will.

29:32.605 --> 29:34.524
I will.

29:34.566 --> 29:35.817
- [speaks Spanish]

29:35.859 --> 29:36.943
Hey!

29:36.985 --> 29:38.570
- To prepare to die.

29:41.489 --> 29:42.615
- [sighs]

29:44.826 --> 29:46.619
- We have to go find it.

29:46.661 --> 29:48.038
- Find what?

29:48.079 --> 29:50.415
- The Pasaje.
- The--wait, what?

29:50.457 --> 29:52.083
- Well, I mean,
that's where they were going,

29:52.125 --> 29:54.627
so we gotta go there too.
- Whoa, whoa, Emma.

29:54.669 --> 29:57.589
A guy died in front of us.

29:57.630 --> 30:00.008
Baltasar got stabbed
in the hand.

30:00.050 --> 30:01.134
I'm sorry, this is over.

30:01.176 --> 30:02.218
I mean, yeah, look.

30:02.260 --> 30:03.762
I got wrapped up
into this, too,

30:03.803 --> 30:04.804
but this shit is done.

30:04.846 --> 30:06.556
Sam and Violet met on vacation.

30:06.598 --> 30:08.683
They thought it would be cool
to explore some

30:08.725 --> 30:09.976
make-believe underground room,

30:10.018 --> 30:11.436
and then they got lost
in the jungle,

30:11.478 --> 30:14.564
and they died because
they got caught in a hurricane.

30:14.606 --> 30:16.274
And that's all assuming
this Iberra guy

30:16.316 --> 30:18.318
even took them out there
in the first place.

30:18.360 --> 30:20.737
Okay?
That is it.

30:20.779 --> 30:22.489
All right? You gotta move on.

30:30.163 --> 30:31.915
Where you going?
- Back to the room.

30:31.956 --> 30:33.416
Don't follow me.

30:37.837 --> 30:40.799
[inquisitive music]

30:40.840 --> 30:47.722
* *

30:55.855 --> 31:02.737

31:36.271 --> 31:43.403

32:04.758 --> 32:11.723
