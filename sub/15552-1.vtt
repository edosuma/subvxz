<i>Night and the city.</i>

02:56.843 --> 02:58.970
Mary?

03:05.318 --> 03:07.479
Mary?

03:52.131 --> 03:54.895
You won't find
any money there, Harry.

03:56.302 --> 03:59.897
What do you mean,
spying on me?

04:00.006 --> 04:04.306
I, uh - I was just
looking for a cigarette.

04:14.520 --> 04:16.784
Mmm.

04:19.892 --> 04:22.122
Would I steal
from you?

04:22.228 --> 04:25.459
- What makes you think I -
- Who are you running away from now?

04:25.565 --> 04:28.591
Running? Me?
Now, you know me better than that.

04:28.701 --> 04:32.228
- Three days and three nights,
and not a word from you.
- Well, I've been very busy.

04:32.338 --> 04:35.899
For all I knew, you were lying in the gutter
somewhere with a knife in your back.

04:36.009 --> 04:37.909
Lying in the gutter?

04:38.011 --> 04:40.912
Now, look, sweetheart.
I'll tell you what happened.

04:41.014 --> 04:43.983
- I was in Birmingham.
- Birmingham?

04:44.083 --> 04:47.109
Yes! There's a fellow up there
starting a new greyhound track.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.450
And he wants me
for a partner.

04:49.555 --> 04:52.820
It's the chance of a lifetime.
I'll be in on the ground floor.

04:52.925 --> 04:56.588
I only expected to be gone for a day,
but when I saw that layout I stayed over.

04:56.696 --> 05:00.154
And when you see -
Look, honey. Look, here's the plan.

05:00.266 --> 05:02.530
How much?

05:02.635 --> 05:06.537
- "How much"?
- Look, Harry, we've been
through this a thousand times.

05:06.639 --> 05:09.039
How much?

05:09.142 --> 05:11.975
Oh. Mmm.
Well, all right.

05:12.078 --> 05:15.343
For our share,
it's only £300.

05:15.448 --> 05:19.179
- £300, and it's a life of ease and plenty.
- No!

05:19.285 --> 05:22.948
- You've got the money. You've got it right here.
- Sure. Sure, I've got it.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.024
But not for
any greyhound track.

05:25.124 --> 05:28.525
- Why, last month it was -
- But this is different, Mary. This can't lose!

05:28.628 --> 05:31.722
Oh, Harry, why can't you
ever grow up?

05:36.169 --> 05:39.730
Harry, you gotta
get hold of yourself.

05:39.839 --> 05:44.208
You can't go on forever
always running, always in a sweat.

05:46.312 --> 05:49.975
Do you think I enjoy working
night after night at the Silver Fox...

05:50.083 --> 05:52.244
getting drunks drunker?

05:52.352 --> 05:55.753
But I'm sticking it out,
waiting for the day we can marry...

05:55.855 --> 05:58.119
lead decent,
normal lives.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.155
Remember them, Harry?

06:03.262 --> 06:07.756
<i>Nice people.</i>
<i>Nice to know and be with.</i>

06:07.867 --> 06:10.665
Remember the plans
they used to make?

06:10.770 --> 06:14.137
The kind of life
they were going to live?

06:17.877 --> 06:20.675
I just want to
be somebody.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.816
I've got to hurry,
Harry.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.850
You'd better hurry too.

06:32.959 --> 06:36.622
- Nosseross is angry with you.
- Let him wait.

06:36.729 --> 06:39.892
Him and his
big, fat belly.

06:39.999 --> 06:42.695
I'm not leaving here.

06:42.802 --> 06:45.464
You mean you're afraid to leave.

06:56.048 --> 06:58.312
How much?

07:01.587 --> 07:06.081
I... paid him everything
but five pounds.

07:06.192 --> 07:09.719
He's the one that put up the money
for the football pool.

07:13.833 --> 07:16.028
Wait here.

- Adam!
- Open the windows!

07:48.301 --> 07:51.532
Don't tell me you tried
cooking spaghetti again.

07:51.637 --> 07:54.105
Yes! With the usual
disastrous results!

07:54.207 --> 07:56.300
Mary, get that siphon bottle there!
Quickly!

07:56.409 --> 07:58.877
- The soda?
- Yes! Hurry! Hurry!

08:00.313 --> 08:02.645
- Here!
- Ohh!

08:02.748 --> 08:05.615
Don't just stand there, woman!
Squirt! Squirt!

08:08.221 --> 08:10.189
There.

08:10.289 --> 08:13.315
You're just in time to enjoy
the most heavenly spaghetti dinner.

08:13.426 --> 08:16.452
Aw, thanks, but I've just had
breakfast, unfortunately.

08:16.562 --> 08:18.962
I admit it does look
a little overdone.

08:19.065 --> 08:21.033
Oh, well.
Try again next week.

08:21.133 --> 08:24.159
Probably starve doing it,
but I'll master it in the end, I promise.

08:24.270 --> 08:27.034
That's the thing that
keeps us apart, you know.

08:27.139 --> 08:29.164
Your spaghetti?

08:29.275 --> 08:31.243
Yes, in a way.

08:31.344 --> 08:34.370
When I'm having my spaghetti,
you're looking for your morning toast.

08:34.480 --> 08:38.506
Do you think we might ever arrange our day
to meet somewhere around teatime?

08:38.618 --> 08:40.347
Come on, sit down.

08:40.453 --> 08:43.751
- Let me get these hideous
monsters out of the way.
- Oh, he's cute!

08:43.856 --> 08:45.847
- She.
- Well, she's cute.

08:45.958 --> 08:49.416
The shops tell me it's the best-selling
design I've given them so far.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.656
- Discouraging.
- You're probably pleased as punch.

08:51.764 --> 08:54.255
Of course. Sit down
and really be comfortable.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.393
Thanks, Adam,
but I've got to get on to work.

08:57.503 --> 08:59.903
- I've come to ask for a favor.
- Name it.

09:00.006 --> 09:03.169
- Could you let me have
three pounds until tomorrow?
- Help yourself.

09:03.276 --> 09:06.677
Punch the night bell. The old lady of
Threadneedle St. Is well stocked and generous.

09:06.779 --> 09:09.373
- It does look like the Bank of England.
- Well, it should.

09:09.482 --> 09:11.848
I spent half my youth
reproducing it.

09:11.951 --> 09:14.078
- It's very good.
- Of course.

Wonderful!

09:19.325 --> 09:21.759
You're very clever,
Adam.

09:21.861 --> 09:24.091
I am about
unimportant things.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.760
Help yourself.

09:27.867 --> 09:31.428
Thanks, Adam.
I happen to need this right now for-

You knew that,
didn't you?

09:43.583 --> 09:46.279
- These walls. Just one big, happy family.
- <i>[Tapping]</i>

09:46.385 --> 09:49.411
He gets so excited,
almost like a child.

09:49.522 --> 09:53.083
But anyone has to fight
not to get pulled in by his excitement.

09:53.192 --> 09:56.218
- His ideas always have so much imagination.
- I know.

09:56.329 --> 09:59.958
- Harry's an artist without an art.
- What does that mean?

10:00.066 --> 10:03.558
Well, that's something that'd
make a man very unhappy, Mary-

10:03.669 --> 10:07.298
groping for the right lever,
the means with which to express himself.

10:07.406 --> 10:09.601
Yes, he is that,
isn't he?

10:09.709 --> 10:12.109
I like that, Adam.
It's a very nice thought.

10:12.211 --> 10:14.236
Yes, but it
can be dangerous.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.508
Oh. No, you don't.
Not again.

10:16.616 --> 10:20.279
Every time you talk, you mix me up so
I can't think straight for a week.

10:20.386 --> 10:22.752
- Thanks, Adam.
- Anything.

10:22.855 --> 10:25.153
Anytime.

- How's Fabian's stocks and shares, Harry?
- Never mind!

10:48.648 --> 10:52.106
- When are you gonna open up
your Paris office, Harry?
- Ehh!

10:52.218 --> 10:54.652

- Evening, Molly, my girl!

10:54.754 --> 10:56.949
Hello, Harry.
How are you?

10:57.056 --> 10:59.650
Well, you're sober.
Trade must be slow.

10:59.759 --> 11:01.727
Slow?
Disintegrating.

11:01.827 --> 11:05.058
- You need a fresh carnation.
- Thanks, Molly. Put it on my account.

11:05.164 --> 11:08.190
- That's all right, my dear. I'll trust you.
- There you are, Bert.

11:08.300 --> 11:10.495

- Bless you, Harry. Half a crown!

<i>If you girls want to work for my husband,</i>
<i>you've got to start off on the right foot.</i>

11:16.275 --> 11:19.802
You must understand the rules -
what he'll stand for and what he won't.

11:19.912 --> 11:23.541
First, no stealing from the gentlemen
while you're in the club.

11:23.649 --> 11:26.049
What you do outside
is none of his business...

11:26.152 --> 11:29.815
but in here we take it from them legitimate
and no complaints later.

11:29.922 --> 11:34.222
Remember, if a gentleman wants to dance,
or if he wants you to sit with him...

11:34.326 --> 11:36.920
your time costs anything
from a quid up.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.224
But don't harp on money.
Be subtle.

11:39.331 --> 11:42.994
Whatever he gives you, take it first,
look disappointed afterwards.

11:43.102 --> 11:46.731
If a man offers you a Turkish cigarette,
tell him you only smoke Virginian.

11:46.839 --> 11:49.865
If he's smoking Virginian,
then you'll smoke Turkish.

11:49.975 --> 11:53.001
Oh, yes, chocolates.
Fancy boxes we sell at two pounds.

11:53.112 --> 11:58.209
- Isn't two quid a bit steep for a box of chocolates?
- They're hand-dipped, deary.

11:58.317 --> 12:03.118
When the night's up, I buy 'em back from you
for a third of what the gentleman paid.

12:03.222 --> 12:05.713
Evening, Phil.

12:05.825 --> 12:09.124
Well, need any help with that stuff?
[Laughs]

12:09.228 --> 12:11.890
- Where have you been, dear boy?
- Well, I-I've, uh -

12:11.997 --> 12:14.363
Been having a pleasant holiday
at Cannes?

12:14.467 --> 12:16.867
Or spending the weekend
at Windsor Castle?

12:16.969 --> 12:20.928
- I've been ill.
- Oh! Tsk-tsk-tsk. Poor boy's been ill.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.270

12:30.750 --> 12:34.083
- Well, where's he been?
- Now, now, Helen. Mustn't be unkind.

12:34.186 --> 12:37.212
- The dear boy's been at death's door.
- Tsk-tsk-tsk.

12:37.323 --> 12:39.484
I'm glad to see
you're fully recovered.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.618
- We were worried about him, weren't we, Phil?
- Indeed we were.

12:42.728 --> 12:47.825
It's getting late. Time for "dear boy"
to get dressed and hop it.

12:49.101 --> 12:51.296

Why, no, it doesn't.

- Good evening, Mr. Fabian.
- Good evening, Emil.

14:14.486 --> 14:16.477

- Darned if I don't lose my wallet.
- No!

Luckily I knew a chap in the loop -
motor supplies. Fella named Lamont.

14:33.505 --> 14:35.871
- Lamont? Did you say Lamont?
- Why, yes.

14:35.975 --> 14:38.375
- You mean Stubby Lamont?
- Why, yes!

14:38.477 --> 14:41.776

- No!

14:41.881 --> 14:45.248
- Oh, wait till I tell Stubby!
- Yes, just wait.

14:45.351 --> 14:48.946
- It's like meeting someone from home.

- Yes! Have a cigarette.
- Yes, have a cigarette.

14:52.191 --> 14:55.354
No, thank you, gentlemen.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.295
Out.

16:40.399 --> 16:42.867
- I beg your pardon.
- Out.

16:42.968 --> 16:47.905
- What do you mean? This is a public place.
- So's the morgue. Move.

16:48.007 --> 16:51.204
Well, evidently
you don't know who I am.

16:51.310 --> 16:56.646
Mr. Kristo don't like club touts
hustling suckers in his arena. Get out!

16:56.749 --> 17:00.549
- Pigs! Pigs! Pigs!
- Gregorious!

17:00.652 --> 17:03.985
- Gregorious!
- Let 'em hear! Pigs! Come on.

17:04.089 --> 17:06.250
Why, that -
that's Gregorious!

17:06.358 --> 17:09.555
- Who?
- Finest wrestler the world's ever known.

17:13.332 --> 17:16.165
Papa, please.
Where are you going?

17:16.268 --> 17:20.728

<i>[Gregorious]</i>
<i>What have you done to wrestling?</i>

17:23.842 --> 17:27.505
Do you think I'd permit Nikolas
to wrestle with such filth?

17:27.613 --> 17:30.104
Now, now, now,
take it easy, old boy-

17:30.215 --> 17:34.845
You do not talk like that
to my father. Get out!

17:34.953 --> 17:38.218
For this I do not
thank you, my son.

17:38.323 --> 17:40.518
Please, Papa,

17:40.626 --> 17:43.186
You must understand
that times have changed.

filthy exhibition wrestling?

18:21.567 --> 18:24.092
- I beg your pardon.
- I demand my money back.

18:24.203 --> 18:27.229
- Easy on. Easy on. Where's your ticket?
- It's right here.

18:27.339 --> 18:30.536
Disgusting.
I've never witnessed such a spectacle.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.941
No.
No, it can't be.

18:40.052 --> 18:42.145
You're not Gregorious.

18:42.254 --> 18:44.984
- Gregorious the Great.
- You see, Nikolas?

18:45.090 --> 18:48.355
There are people
who do not forget great wrestling.

18:48.460 --> 18:51.827
Forget? Forget the greatest wrestler
the world has ever known?

18:51.930 --> 18:55.422
I was just a kid, but how can one
ever forget your glorious struggle...

18:55.534 --> 18:57.502
- with, uh, uh -
- Heiterschmidt?

18:57.603 --> 18:59.696
Heiterschmidt!
Yes, of course! Heiterschmidt!

18:59.805 --> 19:02.433
- I thank you, young man.
- I thank you, sir.

19:02.541 --> 19:05.704
- My name is Harry Fabian.
- This is Nikolas.

19:05.811 --> 19:08.041
- A fine-looking lad.
- Thanks.

19:08.147 --> 19:12.948
Uh, do you suppose you could
pin a man like the Strangler, say?

19:13.051 --> 19:15.042
- Yes.
- Oh.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.645
Strangler?

19:17.756 --> 19:20.623
Nikolas

19:20.726 --> 19:22.887
all in same ring,
same time.

19:22.995 --> 19:26.954
Well -Well, yes,
I should think he could!

19:27.065 --> 19:30.899
I would consider it a great honor if you
and Nikolas would have a drink with me.

19:31.003 --> 19:34.803
Mr. Fabian,
you're a fine young man. I like you.

19:34.907 --> 19:38.138
We'll drink to your great contemporary,

19:38.243 --> 19:41.474
Young man,
you are too charming.

19:41.580 --> 19:44.572
- Very well, young man.
- Fine. Fine.

19:44.683 --> 19:47.345
You know, I have
a strange feeling...

19:47.452 --> 19:49.750
that our meeting tonight
is, uh -

19:49.855 --> 19:53.052
- Well, we'll talk over our drinks.
- Yeah, all right.

Yes, it's nice.
Thank you, Phil.

20:52.317 --> 20:54.285
I've long thought it
appropriate...

20:54.386 --> 20:57.412
that the wife of the owner
of the Silver Fox...

20:57.522 --> 20:59.649
should wear
silver fox.

20:59.758 --> 21:02.784
Not only generous,
but a sense of humor.

Then you won't mind rewarding
my generosity and wit...

- Wrestling. All-in wrestling.
- Eh?

21:47.639 --> 21:52.474
I hold in the palm of my hand the means to
control wrestling in all London!

21:52.577 --> 21:55.102
- Control wrestling?
- In all London.

- You?
- Me.

[Chuckles] Dear fellow,
have you ever heard of a citizen called Kristo?

22:01.653 --> 22:04.554

Know what I got in here, Phil?

22:04.656 --> 22:07.750
- Kristo!
- [Both Laughing]

Gregorious - Kristo's his son.
Don't you see?

22:26.345 --> 22:30.338
Gregorious'll protect me from Kristo.
I only need a few hundred quid.

22:30.449 --> 22:34.215
Just listen to me! You give me 400 quid,
I'll make you a rich man!

get it.

22:54.539 --> 22:57.064
Get 300. 200.

22:57.175 --> 23:00.406
Yes, why don't you get 200 of your own
and put it on that desk?

23:00.512 --> 23:03.538
My husband will match it.
Right, Phil?

23:03.648 --> 23:06.879
That's right.
Put 200 in and I'll match it.

23:06.985 --> 23:11.046
All right, I'll get it! I'll get twice,
three times 400 and I'll fling it in your face!

waiting.

- But you don't understand, Figler. I've got -
- Here. Strap this on.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.946
- You look like a good type for a stump.
- Figler, listen to me -

23:45.056 --> 23:48.082
Harry, apart from my beggars
I'm all alone in the world.

23:48.193 --> 23:50.957
I've got no wife,
no kids, no family.

23:51.062 --> 23:54.088
That's right.
All you need now is these specs.

- You look lovely.
- Look, I've got an angle that can't be beat.

23:57.335 --> 24:00.998
Don't forget to tuck your trouser legs in.
You'll give the game away.

24:01.106 --> 24:04.132
- Now, listen to me -
- Harry, all I got is me money.

24:04.242 --> 24:08.303
And between me and me money is a kind of
understanding, like holy matrimony-

24:08.413 --> 24:10.404
till death us do part.

24:10.515 --> 24:13.848
But I can't miss, Figler!
Figler, will you listen!

24:13.952 --> 24:16.182
I like you, Harry.

24:16.288 --> 24:20.486
Why don't you settle down, get hold of a few
good beggars and put 'em out on the street?

24:20.592 --> 24:23.618
I'll give you all the supplies you need -
legs, eyes, stumps.

24:23.728 --> 24:27.459
- What are you talking about?
- You can make a nice living out of it.

24:27.566 --> 24:31.332
I bring you a fortune,
you give me beggars!

24:33.138 --> 24:37.370
If I had the money, I could help you,
couldn't I? Right.

24:37.476 --> 24:41.936
And if I could help you,
I would, wouldn't I? Right.

24:42.047 --> 24:45.380

you can't pull 'em up, now, can you?

But this is a golden opportunity.
One chance in a thousand.

24:55.393 --> 24:57.725

simple sorry, Harry...

25:00.131 --> 25:02.326
but if you want
anything else...

25:02.434 --> 25:06.063
I can print you a passport,
birth certificate, medical license.

Balance of the nylons.
Good.

another 50,000 cigarettes.

25:23.522 --> 25:26.548
Ah, cigarettes, stockings.
This is big, Anna!

25:26.658 --> 25:30.719
One business, and that don't call for me
to put 200 quid into another man's game.

- <i>But it's the chance of a lifetime.</i>
- Anna O'Leary don't take chances.

hardheaded businesswoman.

the rest of your life living like this, do ya?

29:16.020 --> 29:17.920
- There'll be no wrestling.
- What?

29:18.022 --> 29:19.956
- I've got a nightclub.
- What?

29:20.058 --> 29:22.117
Yes, my own. Bought a year ago.
Flamenco's old club.

29:22.227 --> 29:24.058
Flamenco's closed down.

29:24.162 --> 29:27.791
- Struck off by the police for two years.
- That's why I got it on credit.

29:27.899 --> 29:31.767
In another year, all I do is put up five shillings
for a license, and I'm in business.

29:31.870 --> 29:34.304
But I can't wait
another day.

29:34.405 --> 29:36.965
One more year
living with that -

29:37.075 --> 29:40.738
I've got to get away from him, Harry.
I must get away before I -

29:40.845 --> 29:43.245
That's what the money's for-
the license.

29:43.348 --> 29:45.942
And you're the only man I know
who can get it.

29:46.050 --> 29:47.950
You're gonna bribe,
steal, murder-

29:48.052 --> 29:52.079
I don't care what you do,
but you're gonna get me a license for my club now.

29:52.190 --> 29:55.455
- But if Phil gives me the 200,
it's got to be for wrestling.
- That's right.

29:55.560 --> 29:58.791
But you'll just go through the motions
till we're ready to open the club.

29:58.897 --> 30:02.628
- But Phil's no easy mark.
- I know. I'm gonna give you -

30:02.734 --> 30:05.760
You're crazy, Helen.
You don't know what I've got.

30:05.870 --> 30:08.634
I've got Gregorious! A shield!
I've got Kristo stopped cold!

30:08.740 --> 30:11.004
I can control wrestling
in London!

30:11.109 --> 30:13.805
I'm through hustling for nightclubs,
for you or for anybody else.

30:13.912 --> 30:16.574
For yourself!
What do you think Phil takes in an evening?

30:16.681 --> 30:20.811
Never less than a hundred quid.
And who runs the place for him? I do. Me.

30:20.919 --> 30:23.319
I know
how to make a club spin.

30:23.421 --> 30:26.447
If he can do that,
just think, Harry, think.

30:26.558 --> 30:28.549
We're younger, stronger,
healthier than he is.

30:28.660 --> 30:32.187
We've got more life in our little finger
than he has in the whole of his body.

30:32.297 --> 30:36.324
Oh, Harry, we must. I've got to get away
from him. Please, Harry. Please! Please!

30:36.434 --> 30:38.459
Helen, listen - Listen!

30:40.338 --> 30:42.738
You can still
get away from Phil.

30:42.841 --> 30:46.572
This wrestling pitch is gonna mean
a lot to us. It's gonna mean the whole -

30:54.652 --> 30:57.018
All right, Helen.

30:57.121 --> 30:59.521
You always were
a smart girl.

30:59.624 --> 31:01.717
[Laughs]

31:01.826 --> 31:04.021
Maybe you're right.

31:04.128 --> 31:06.323
I'm always right.

31:08.132 --> 31:10.862
Now telephone
that wrestler.

31:10.969 --> 31:13.529
Tell him you're set.

31:13.638 --> 31:16.334
You'll string him
<i>and</i> Phil along.

31:16.441 --> 31:19.672
But night and day,
you're gonna do one thing -

31:19.777 --> 31:22.245
rip London apart
if you have to...

31:22.347 --> 31:25.976
but you're going to
get me that license.

31:27.352 --> 31:29.479
All right, Helen.

31:36.661 --> 31:40.188
- <i>[Nosseross] Who is it?</i>
- We are looking for a Mr. Harry Fabian.

31:40.298 --> 31:42.596
<i>He's not here.</i>
<i>The place is closed. Go away.</i>

31:42.700 --> 31:44.793
Mr. Kristo sent us.

31:45.837 --> 31:50.035
- Sorry. Forgive me.
- It is I who must ask you
to forgive this intrusion, sir.

31:50.141 --> 31:53.770
But it is imperative that I have a few words
with Mr. Harry Fabian.

31:53.878 --> 31:56.073
I understand he is
employed by you, sir.

31:56.180 --> 31:58.546
Well, in a manner
of speaking.

31:58.650 --> 32:02.086
- He works on commission.
But I should hardly regard -
- Ah, yes, quite.

32:02.186 --> 32:05.883
My name, sir, is Chilk. Fergus Chilk.
I am Mr. Kristo's personal solicitor.

32:05.990 --> 32:09.551
This is Mr. Yosh.
He also is employed by Mr. Kristo.

32:09.661 --> 32:12.653
Well, if there's anything
I can do for Mr. Kristo -

32:12.764 --> 32:14.959
Yes, quite. Thank you.

32:15.066 --> 32:18.092
Mr. Kristo is disturbed.
Yes, disturbed.

32:18.202 --> 32:22.935
Word has reached him that Harry Fabian
is about to engage in the promotion of wrestling.

32:23.041 --> 32:26.067
It is Mr. Kristo's
opinion, sir...

32:26.177 --> 32:30.580
that this Mr. Fabian
would find such a venture... unprofitable.

32:30.682 --> 32:34.413
I can assure you that Mr. Kristo
need have no concern.

32:34.519 --> 32:38.580
Tonight Mr. Fabian is pleased to regard himself
as a great sports promoter.

32:38.690 --> 32:41.352
Tomorrow he will undoubtedly
own Covent Garden.

32:41.459 --> 32:44.951
- He is given to these flights of fancy.
- Ah, yes, quite.

32:45.063 --> 32:48.965
Mr. Kristo has found it necessary
to leave for Liverpool on business.

32:49.067 --> 32:51.262
Therefore,
it might prove fruitful...

32:51.369 --> 32:55.032
if Mr. Fabian called on me
for a brief talk.

32:55.139 --> 32:58.165
Would you give him
my card, sir?

32:58.276 --> 33:00.437
I shall be delighted.

33:00.545 --> 33:02.672
Thank you.
Good night.

33:02.780 --> 33:05.544
- Good night.
- [Yosh] Good night.

33:39.183 --> 33:41.481
<i>How's your headache, deary?</i>

33:41.586 --> 33:45.647
How many times have I told you not to eat
down here? You drop that swill, it brings mice.

33:45.757 --> 33:48.783
- Clean it up and get out!
- Yes, my love.

33:52.663 --> 33:55.257
- Still up, pet?
- Come here, Helen.

33:55.366 --> 33:59.029
I'm just dead beat, pet.
I had a bit of a headache, so I walked it off.

33:59.137 --> 34:01.662
- I want to talk to you.
- Oh, in the morning, pet.

34:01.773 --> 34:04.435
- Didn't we do well tonight, though?
- Now!

34:17.789 --> 34:19.949
I've been thinking,
Helen.

34:20.058 --> 34:23.721
I'm a rich man.
Richer than you know.

34:23.828 --> 34:28.356
I want to clear out, sell this place,
get rid of everything.

34:30.635 --> 34:33.399
Just travel,
enjoy ourselves.

34:33.504 --> 34:35.699
See a bit of the world.

34:35.806 --> 34:39.208
- Bermuda, Jamaica -
- Mmm. Sounds exciting, pet.

34:39.310 --> 34:42.302
But somehow I'm not in the mood
for a holiday just now.

34:42.413 --> 34:44.643
<i>[Door Opens, Closes]</i>

- <i>[Footsteps Running]</i>

34:50.221 --> 34:53.156
Count it.
Two hundred quid, Phil.

34:53.257 --> 34:56.248
Right on your desk.
Match it.

34:56.360 --> 34:59.090
[Laughs]
Didn't think I could do it, did ya?

34:59.197 --> 35:01.392
Didn't think
I could raise two bob.

35:01.499 --> 35:04.662
Well, there it is - 200.
This is it, Phil.

35:04.769 --> 35:06.964
Put up your money.
You're my partner.

35:07.071 --> 35:10.802
I'll play it square. I'll play it fair and square
right down the line.

35:10.908 --> 35:14.400
[Chuckles]
And watch our 400 quid grow, Phil.

35:14.512 --> 35:16.673

is just the beginning.

35:16.781 --> 35:18.976

35:19.083 --> 35:21.278
<i>You'll be proud of me.</i>

35:21.385 --> 35:24.821
<i>You'll be proud to say, "Harry Fabian?</i>
<i>Why, he's my partner. "</i>

35:24.922 --> 35:28.983
<i>[Chuckling] Yes, sir! Well, say the word, Phil.</i>
<i>Are you in or out?</i>

35:31.395 --> 35:36.094
- So you really did it, didn't you, Harry?
- There it is.

35:38.035 --> 35:40.265
Yes, I must admit...

35:45.643 --> 35:47.873
I have underestimated you.

Oh, that's all right, Phil.
No hard feelings.

35:54.318 --> 35:56.809
Thank you, Harry.

35:56.921 --> 36:00.357
Yes, you have ideas.
Very smart ideas.

Very happy indeed.

- Fine, fine. You won't regret it, Phil.

Yes, I, uh -

39:34.004 --> 39:37.531
I have here the copy of a contract.
I've read it with great interest.

39:37.641 --> 39:40.667
Mr. Chilk is going to
read it to you.

39:40.778 --> 39:43.212
"Agreed: Strand Arena, Limited...

39:43.314 --> 39:45.509
agrees to let
to Harry Fabian -"

39:45.616 --> 39:47.811
- That is you. Harry Fabian.
- Yes, that is me.

I'd be honored,
Mr. Kristo, if you came -

40:34.932 --> 40:37.162
Go away, Mr. Fabian.

Go to Montreal,
which is in Canada.

In London you cannot.

40:44.041 --> 40:46.168
I say it, Mr. Fabian.

Then I suggest
you say it...

40:49.847 --> 40:52.077
to my partner.

41:00.724 --> 41:04.182
Mr. Kristo, my partner.

41:04.295 --> 41:07.696
Mr. Kristo has made
an interesting suggestion -

41:07.798 --> 41:12.497
that we go to Montreal because
we can't promote wrestling in London.

41:14.205 --> 41:16.366
What do you think,
Gregorious?

41:16.474 --> 41:21.173
- Mr. Kristo says there's no room for you in London.
- Papa, you did not go home.

41:21.278 --> 41:24.304
- What do you want?
- I -

41:24.415 --> 41:28.784
- I want to talk to you. Now.
- I have nothing to hear from you.

41:28.886 --> 41:33.516
I beg you to listen. You must not
get mixed up with this - this club tout.

41:33.624 --> 41:38.687
If you would say something good
about Mr. Fabian, then I worry.

41:38.796 --> 41:41.356
Papa, please.
Everybody in London knows what he is.

41:41.465 --> 41:43.831
He'll swindle you. He'll cheat you.
He'll break your heart.

41:43.934 --> 41:46.334
You have break my heart.

41:46.437 --> 41:48.962
He is my partner
and my friend.

41:49.073 --> 41:51.507
Stay away from him,
my son.

41:51.609 --> 41:55.545
When you lift your hand to him,
you strike me.

42:09.593 --> 42:13.654
You're very sharp, Mr. Fabian.
You've done a very sharp thing.

42:13.764 --> 42:17.359
Maybe even sharp enough
to cut your throat.

42:17.468 --> 42:20.699
You've made my father believe in you,
but I know you.

42:20.804 --> 42:24.331
Born a hustler,
you will die a hustler.

42:25.976 --> 42:29.878
All right. But you promised him
clean wrestling.

42:29.980 --> 42:32.175
Give him
clean wrestling.

42:32.283 --> 42:35.514
Do not betray

42:59.643 --> 43:03.409
Great stroke of luck. My connection
came through. You've got your license.

43:03.514 --> 43:07.109
Oh, I knew it. If there's anybody in London
who could do it, it'd be you.

43:07.217 --> 43:09.742
It's gonna cost you, though.
It wasn't easy to get.

43:09.853 --> 43:12.981
But it's 18 karat, straight out of
the police court. I'll bring the license to you -

43:13.090 --> 43:17.390
- No, stay where you are. I'll meet you there.
- No! That won't be necessary.

43:17.494 --> 43:20.622
You see, uh, I, uh -
I haven't got it yet.

43:20.731 --> 43:24.997
But you just said you had it. What are you
up to, Harry? Am I gonna meet you or not?

43:25.102 --> 43:30.301
Well, all right. I-I-I'll meet you
at the court at, uh, 3:00.

43:30.407 --> 43:33.399
No. No, Helen,
make it, uh, 4:00.

43:33.510 --> 43:36.479
All right. But please
don't keep me waiting, Harry.

43:36.580 --> 43:38.878
I'll be there at 4:00.
Good-bye.

44:09.246 --> 44:13.012
You did tell me once,
but where is the motor vehicle department?

44:13.117 --> 44:16.644
Out to the right, down the embankment
steps, the other end of the building.

44:16.754 --> 44:19.279
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

44:39.309 --> 44:42.745
Mr. Nosseross,
you puzzle me.

44:42.846 --> 44:45.041
You confuse me.

44:45.149 --> 44:48.676
How is it possible that you want to invest
in Kristo's Enterprises...

44:48.786 --> 44:51.186
and at the same time
you're backing Harry Fabian?

44:51.288 --> 44:54.849
- I don't quite understand.
- I know that you are Fabian's backer.

44:54.958 --> 44:57.222
Now, let's have that clear.

44:59.096 --> 45:02.156
Now, what do you really want?

45:03.867 --> 45:06.199
Harry Fabian is in my way.

45:06.303 --> 45:10.364
Harry Fabian is in <i>my</i> way
because of you. You fed him money-

45:10.474 --> 45:14.001
I can withdraw that money,
and then you will be free to deal with him.

45:14.111 --> 45:17.205
You miss the point,
Mr. Nosseross.

45:17.314 --> 45:20.215
It isn't your money
that keeps him alive.

45:20.317 --> 45:23.115
Harry Fabian
is not a competitor.

45:23.220 --> 45:26.451
As long as he keeps his promise to promote
only Greco-Roman wrestling...

45:26.557 --> 45:28.616
his business failure
is certain.

45:28.726 --> 45:31.422
The public simply won't buy it,
but the point is...

45:31.528 --> 45:34.964
my father would still believe
that Harry Fabian is an honorable man...

45:35.065 --> 45:37.295
and I can't touch him.

45:37.401 --> 45:43.306
He's unpunished, and I'm not satisfied merely
to see him become a hustler once again.

45:43.407 --> 45:47.571
- Neither am I.
- Just a minute. We haven't finished.

45:47.678 --> 45:50.545
I'll deliver Fabian
to you.

45:50.647 --> 45:55.812
Your father shall learn
that Harry Fabian is not an honorable man.

46:02.259 --> 46:04.727
Hello, Phil.
Sorry to be late.

46:04.828 --> 46:08.059
So many things to take care of.
Business, business, business.

46:08.165 --> 46:10.224
Why'd you ask me
to meet you here?

46:10.334 --> 46:13.929
- I'm afraid of Kristo. You're not.
- You bet I'm not.

46:14.037 --> 46:16.733
He came to the gym last Monday.
You know what he said?

46:16.840 --> 46:19.741
"Go to Montreal, which is in Canada."
[Chuckling]

46:19.843 --> 46:22.744
You know what I did?
Had the bouncer toss him down the stairs.

46:22.846 --> 46:25.314
- He crawled like a sewer rat.
- I'm sure.

46:25.415 --> 46:29.909
There's one thing to settle - the hundred quid
for the final payment in the arena.

46:30.020 --> 46:33.114
- We're all set.
- Harry, I brought you here to tell you...

46:33.223 --> 46:35.589
that I'm withdrawing
from our partnership.

46:35.692 --> 46:39.594
- What?
- I'm advised that your kind
of wrestling can't succeed.

46:39.696 --> 46:43.462
This Greco-Roman,
it won't draw flies.

46:43.567 --> 46:46.468
But you can't back out now.
You've invested a lot of money.

46:46.570 --> 46:50.062
I'm sorry.
I'll take the loss. And that's final.

46:53.410 --> 46:57.437
Phil, wait! Phil.
Phil, wait.

46:57.548 --> 47:00.449
Why are you backing out?
Everything's in the palm of my hand. Why?

47:00.551 --> 47:02.815
I refuse to throw
good money after bad.

47:02.920 --> 47:05.889
- But you know what this means to me, Phil.
- Harry. Harry.

47:05.989 --> 47:08.048
This is my last word
on the subject.

47:08.158 --> 47:11.457
Get a box office attraction, a big name,
then you'll get the money.

47:11.562 --> 47:13.325
What do you mean?

47:13.430 --> 47:15.625
Well, I know nothing
about wrestling...

47:15.732 --> 47:18.132
but I'm told there are men
who are big draws.

47:18.235 --> 47:21.329
- Men like, for instance, the Strangler.
- The Stra -

47:21.438 --> 47:24.874
But I can't.
Gregorious would leave me.

47:24.975 --> 47:28.877
If you don't, I'm forced to leave you.
And then where are you?

47:28.979 --> 47:32.915
As I see it, Harry, your only course
is to keep moving right ahead.

47:33.016 --> 47:35.849
Go on, get the Strangler.
That's your first problem.

47:35.953 --> 47:39.980
Then I'm sure you'll have no difficulty
in persuading any wrestler to meet him.

47:40.090 --> 47:43.548
Seems to me you have
no alternative, have you?

47:46.930 --> 47:50.024
All right, I can do it.
I can do it. I'll do it.

47:50.133 --> 47:53.227
- But will you give me the money
to get the Strangler?
- Of course I will.

47:53.337 --> 47:57.239
I'll back you without limit.
I consider it a sound investment, dear boy.

47:57.341 --> 47:59.400
All right.

48:08.018 --> 48:10.043
~~ <i>[Band: Upbeat]</i>

48:19.796 --> 48:22.697
Give him another of the same.
Gin for me.

48:22.799 --> 48:25.734
- Hello, Beer. What's the good word?
- Well, hello to you.

48:25.836 --> 48:28.930
Hey, word's all over town
that you made Kristo turn tail.

48:29.039 --> 48:32.031
- How'd you do it?
- Brains, chum. Brains and guts.

48:32.142 --> 48:35.578
- There's no stopping you now, eh, Harry?
- Never was.

48:35.679 --> 48:39.240
- Where's the Strangler?
- He's joined Madame La Posh's circus for dinner.

48:39.349 --> 48:41.374
Look at him.

48:43.720 --> 48:47.884
- Ain't he a cute sight?
- Yes, very cute. Very cute.

48:47.991 --> 48:50.960
Uh, Beer, uh...

48:51.061 --> 48:54.155
how much do you get for the Strangler
when he fights for Kristo?

48:54.264 --> 48:58.394
- That all depends.
- Fifty quid. That's what you get.

48:58.502 --> 49:03.166
All right, now that I've shown you managers
that Kristo's all bubble and squeak...

49:03.273 --> 49:05.969
I'm ready to throw
a little business your way.

49:06.076 --> 49:10.012
Next week the Strangler
fights for me - 100 quid.

49:10.113 --> 49:14.675
Hey, you ain't in such a cushy spot
after all, are you, Harry?

49:14.785 --> 49:17.754
You really need the Strangler, don't you?

49:17.854 --> 49:20.516
Two hundred quid,
Harry.

49:20.624 --> 49:23.752
All right, all right. Two hundred it is.
The Strangler fights Nikolas.

49:23.860 --> 49:26.192
Nikolas?
Hey, that's a good show.

49:26.296 --> 49:29.823
But how are you gonna make
old Gregorious swallow that?

49:29.933 --> 49:33.334
Don't look surprised
at anything that happens.

49:37.708 --> 49:40.108
Come on.
Keep your mouth shut.

49:46.783 --> 49:50.219
No, no, no, no, no.
I'd do it to oblige you, Beer.

49:50.320 --> 49:53.448
But Gregorious wouldn't let
the Strangler within 10 feet of him.

49:53.557 --> 49:57.357
You know what he did to him that morning?
Threw him out of the gym.

49:57.461 --> 49:59.520
The Strangler
fight Nikolas?

49:59.629 --> 50:03.463
Why, that clown isn't fit
to breathe the same air as Nikolas.

50:03.567 --> 50:07.162
- Hey, you, I kill Nikolas. I break him in pieces!
- Well, hello, Strangler.

50:07.270 --> 50:09.864
You kill! You break!
[Laughs]

50:09.973 --> 50:13.841
You didn't do it that morning.
Your boy's quite a comedian.

50:13.944 --> 50:16.640
I saw Nikolas take
one step toward him...

50:16.747 --> 50:19.511
your boy turned white
and took two steps back.

50:19.616 --> 50:22.710
I step back from that dancing boy?
Next time I see him, I'll kill him.

50:22.819 --> 50:26.220
You can see him now, brave man.
He's at the gym. Why don't you drop in?

50:26.323 --> 50:29.884
Oh, yes, yes, yes. I know.
You're having dinner.

50:56.486 --> 50:58.386
- Uh-uh.
- Hmm.

51:00.223 --> 51:04.023
Oh, if I move here,
you give me wrist lock.

51:06.997 --> 51:11.525
If you move here,
I give you head lock.

51:11.635 --> 51:13.603
Move.

51:15.505 --> 51:18.906
<i>Be a brave boy.</i>
<i>Move.</i>

51:19.009 --> 51:23.070
Hello, boys. Why don't you both move?
It's time to go home.

51:23.180 --> 51:26.081
No, no, no, no, no.
Just few minutes rest, but plenty work.

51:26.183 --> 51:28.447
<i>[Beer] Strangler, what's the matter?</i>
<i>You crazy?</i>

51:28.552 --> 51:30.816
You, Nikolas!
I crush you!

51:30.921 --> 51:34.482
- <i>Now, look, I threw you out of here once!</i>
- Call me clown!

51:34.591 --> 51:37.424
We don't want you here!
Get out!

51:37.527 --> 51:40.394
Come and fight, dancing boy.
What, are you too afraid?

51:40.497 --> 51:44.228
- Get out!
- Beer, take him away. Get him out of here.

51:44.334 --> 51:49.067
You -You old woman.
Why don't you let him fight me? Come fight!

51:49.172 --> 51:51.640
<i>Wait! Wait!</i>
<i>All right!</i>

51:51.741 --> 51:54.642
All right, you'll fight him.
Nikolas will fight you.

51:54.744 --> 51:57.076
But a match, in public,
with a referee.

51:57.180 --> 51:59.080
Gregorious, we've got to show 'em.

51:59.182 --> 52:01.548
Once and for all,
we've got to show 'em.

52:01.651 --> 52:04.381
We'll let Nikolas
break this clown in half.

52:09.960 --> 52:12.451
Yes.

52:12.562 --> 52:16.589
- I let my boy crush you.
- Crush me?

52:16.700 --> 52:19.794
Beer! Take your boy
in my office.

52:19.903 --> 52:22.565
I'll be in in a minute.

52:23.874 --> 52:25.933
Gregorious,
it's the only way.

52:26.042 --> 52:30.342
We'll let Nikolas finish him
and his whole cheap circus, once and for all.

52:32.816 --> 52:34.875
Once and for all.

52:39.456 --> 52:42.948
- Harry, you're -
- Shh.

52:45.061 --> 52:48.360
Harry, you're sensational.
You're a wonder.

52:48.465 --> 52:50.524
Do you know what
you've just done?

52:50.634 --> 52:53.797
You've just cooked up the biggest
wrestling match London will ever see.

52:53.904 --> 52:56.998
- How'd you do it, boy?
- Just brains and guts.

52:57.107 --> 53:01.009
You're clever, Harry, and no mistake.
And you're quick too.

53:01.111 --> 53:04.842
- How quick can you pay me that 200 quid?
- Mickey, hold your breath.

53:04.948 --> 53:08.975
Be back by the time you read the contract,
with the 200 quid.

53:09.085 --> 53:12.179
Have yourself a drink.
Here, use my pen to sign it.

53:12.289 --> 53:16.225
Harry, boy,
I don't know how you do it.

53:24.201 --> 53:28.331
Phil, I've done it. Beauty versus the beast.
Yesterday versus today.

53:28.438 --> 53:30.838
You'll get 1,000 percent
on your money.

53:30.941 --> 53:35.071
- I told you never to come here.
- I've got the Strangler.

53:39.015 --> 53:42.178
- Is this the truth?
- He's at the gym right now with his manager.

53:42.285 --> 53:46.381
Go ahead. See for yourself. Call my office.
Temple Bar, double-0, 0-1.

53:46.489 --> 53:50.016
[Cackles]
Double-0, 0-1.

53:50.126 --> 53:54.426
Yes, sir! Strangler and his manager
sitting at my desk.

53:54.531 --> 53:58.558
Sitting at my desk.
Contract's ready, ready to sign.

53:58.668 --> 54:01.535
And all he wants is...

54:03.873 --> 54:05.932
two hundred quid.

54:06.042 --> 54:08.203
So you've got
the Strangler, hmm?

54:08.311 --> 54:11.576
- And he's in your gymnasium at the moment.
- That's right.

54:11.681 --> 54:13.740
Wonderful, Harry.

54:13.850 --> 54:16.546
You really are a wonder,
no mistake.

54:16.653 --> 54:19.315
- I knew I could count on you.
- Sure.

54:19.422 --> 54:21.617
Hello?
Mr. Nosseross here.

54:21.725 --> 54:25.161
I want to talk
to Mr. Kristo, please.

54:25.262 --> 54:27.321
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>I'll hold on.</i>

54:30.033 --> 54:33.332
- Kristo?
- Yes, dear boy. Kristo.

54:33.436 --> 54:38.271
There comes a time when a lad must learn
the true facts of life... and death.

54:38.375 --> 54:42.311
- <i>Well, dear boy, your time has come.</i>
- What are you saying?

54:45.548 --> 54:48.915
Consequently, I feel it my duty
to tell him about the Strangler.

54:49.019 --> 54:51.078
What are you saying?

54:51.187 --> 54:55.146
I'm saying that nobody-
<i>nobody</i> cuts in on Philip Nosseross.

54:55.258 --> 54:58.659
No, dear boy, I am not
giving you 200 quid.

54:58.762 --> 55:01.993
I am giving you
the sharp edge of the knife.

55:02.098 --> 55:04.157
Hello? I'll wait.

55:05.435 --> 55:07.528
You've been trying
to kill me.

55:07.637 --> 55:10.538
- I have.
- Why?

55:10.640 --> 55:12.699
Because you're a thief.

55:12.809 --> 55:15.937
You tried to steal something from me,
something I bought and paid for.

55:16.046 --> 55:18.071
Well, I -

55:19.249 --> 55:21.308
Helen?

55:21.418 --> 55:23.886
Helen? Oh, no.
No, no, no.

55:23.987 --> 55:26.979
Phil, listen to me. Put down that phone.
Put that phone down!

55:27.090 --> 55:29.615
I don't want Helen.
She means nothing to me. Nothing!

55:29.726 --> 55:31.956
She gave you the money.

55:33.563 --> 55:37.556
Yes, but I took it because I was desperate.
You wouldn't listen to me, remember?

55:37.667 --> 55:40.795
But I didn't cross you.
I played it straight with you.

55:40.904 --> 55:45.466
Hello? Well, find him, please.
It's very urgent.

55:45.575 --> 55:47.839
Tell him to go at once
to Fabian's gymnasium.

55:47.944 --> 55:49.969
He'll find the Strangler there.

55:51.014 --> 55:53.073
Phil! Phil.

55:53.183 --> 55:55.242
Now, please
don't make a scene.

55:55.352 --> 55:57.411
You committed a crime
against me...

55:57.520 --> 56:00.648
but it'll be Kristo who'll punish you
for betraying his father.

56:00.757 --> 56:04.921
Now just leave quietly like the little gentleman
you've always wanted to be.

56:05.028 --> 56:09.089
[Loud Laughing]

56:09.199 --> 56:12.726
So you think
you've done me in, huh?

56:12.836 --> 56:18.035
Well, you're wrong.
I have a little information for you, dear boy.

56:18.141 --> 56:21.736
The old man, Gregorious,
he's standing by me.

56:21.845 --> 56:25.372
Yes, he wants Nikolas to fight the Strangler.
I made him want it!

56:25.482 --> 56:27.507
He wants it!

56:30.019 --> 56:32.214
You are a wonder.

56:32.322 --> 56:37.191
You did it,
and now you can get rich.

56:37.293 --> 56:41.127
You've got Kristo stopped.
You've got the Strangler.

56:41.231 --> 56:44.223
And Gregorious
is on your side.

56:44.334 --> 56:46.802
It's a wonderful
situation...

56:46.903 --> 56:49.565
because you've
got it all.

56:49.672 --> 56:53.472
But you can't put the fight on
because you don't have the money...

56:53.576 --> 56:57.945
and there isn't a man in all London
who'll let you have a shilling.

56:58.047 --> 57:00.481
You've got it all...

57:00.583 --> 57:03.984
but you're a dead man,
Harry Fabian.

57:04.087 --> 57:06.146
A dead man.

57:20.570 --> 57:23.664
[Crash]
