Every year, on my birthday,
Randy wakes up early...

00:04.905 --> 00:08.576
to make me breakfast in bed.

00:08.642 --> 00:12.646
Unfortunately,
he's not used to being up early,
and falls right back asleep.

00:12.713 --> 00:16.117
[ Snoring ]
Randy.

00:16.184 --> 00:18.018
The thing I was most happy
to celebrate...

00:18.086 --> 00:21.222
was not bein' the third person
at the motel to be killed
in a bed fire.

00:21.289 --> 00:24.792
Another thing I was celebratin'
was doin' more good things
this year...

00:24.858 --> 00:26.760
than I had in my entire life,

00:26.827 --> 00:29.830
like helpin' a gay guy
come out of the closet,

00:29.897 --> 00:31.799
returning a nun
to her holy place,

00:31.865 --> 00:33.734
un-ruining a wedding,

00:33.801 --> 00:36.870
and helpin' some freaks
jump back into the world.

00:36.937 --> 00:39.073
Lookin' back on the year made me
feel pretty proud of myself.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.342
Is there gum
in these pancakes?

00:41.409 --> 00:43.344
Yeah. I put all your
favorite things in there.

00:43.411 --> 00:45.746
There's beer
and gummy worms.

00:45.813 --> 00:47.815
And you know that button
that came off your yellow shirt?

00:47.881 --> 00:51.819
I put that in there too,
kinda as a joke, but I think
one of us already ate it.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.455
Happy birthday.
Thanks, Randy.

00:54.522 --> 00:57.558
I really think this is
gonna be a happy birthday. Oh!

00:57.625 --> 01:00.561
Found the button.

01:00.628 --> 01:03.131
My name is Earl.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.470
[ Earl Narrating ]
This birthday felt different
than other ones.

01:09.537 --> 01:12.106
And not just 'cause I didn't
start drinkin' at noon.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.342
I had gone a whole year
doin' good things,

01:14.408 --> 01:16.477
and Randy was throwin' me
a party to celebrate.

01:16.544 --> 01:18.812
Thanks for the button.
It's a good size.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.948
I have a customer at Club Chubby
who makes them.

01:21.014 --> 01:25.052
It's not a great business, so he
has to tip me for his lap dances
with buttons.

01:25.119 --> 01:27.888
Look at the cake I got.
It was half price.

01:27.955 --> 01:31.325
Who's Gary?
Some guy at the Department
of Water and Power...

01:31.392 --> 01:33.627
who was standin' in some water
when he touched some power.

01:33.694 --> 01:36.063
He's gonna be fine, but they
postponed the retirement party.

01:36.130 --> 01:38.098
We're invited.
"No gifts, please."

01:38.166 --> 01:40.134
Good. I wouldn't have
known what to get him.

01:40.201 --> 01:42.102
It's an ice-cream cake.

01:42.170 --> 01:44.572
That's your favorite kind
of cake because it's got
ice cream in the middle,

01:44.638 --> 01:46.607
just like your
favorite kind of truck does.

01:46.674 --> 01:49.510
You know, an ice-cream truck.
I do love ice-cream trucks.

01:49.577 --> 01:54.448
Remember how much fun we used
to have with that ice-cream
truck in the trailer park?

01:54.515 --> 01:58.752
[ Earl Narrating ] A few years
ago, I was into some show
where guys acted like jackasses.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.954
I think it was called Dumbass.
[ Snoring ]

02:01.021 --> 02:05.393
Anyway, when my neighbor's
cable got shut off,
I had to entertain myself.

But the tricks
didn't stop there.

02:16.270 --> 02:20.374
I found lots of other fun ways
to wake Randy up.

02:20.441 --> 02:23.143
[ Vacuum Suctioning ]
Oh, God! Oh, God!
What's happening?

02:23.211 --> 02:25.613
What's happening?
Oh, God! What's happening?

[ Gasps ]

02:33.987 --> 02:36.524

Listen, I'm sorry.
It's on my list,

02:48.101 --> 02:51.539
but tonight's not about what's
still on my list, it's about
what I've crossed off.

02:51.605 --> 02:54.608
It's been a good year, Randy.
I'm gonna go mingle.

02:54.675 --> 02:58.412
Hey, Pickled Egg Guy.
Lookin' good.

02:58.479 --> 03:01.915
Nice hat,

Hey, Nescobar-A-Lop-Lop.
How's the English comin'?

I speak better than you,

[ Chuckles ]

03:10.491 --> 03:13.394
There you go, Willie.
See that, Mom?
I help people.

03:13.461 --> 03:17.064
Earl, I was just telling
One-Eyed William about the time
you peed on my brand-new rug.

03:17.130 --> 03:19.567
[ Laughing ]
What a story.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.635
There's no way
you'd remember that.

03:21.702 --> 03:24.238
[ Earl Narrating ]
Mom was right.
I didn't remember.

03:24.305 --> 03:28.576
But I'd heard about it enough
times to know what it was.
[ Giggling ]

03:28.642 --> 03:32.079
Now, you come back here
and get this diaper on,

[ Door Opening ]
Oh.

03:34.114 --> 03:37.751
I think I hear your daddy
comin' back from his night out
with his friends.

03:39.186 --> 03:41.622
Earl, what are you doing?

03:41.689 --> 03:44.258
Not on the rug!
What are you doin'
in the bathroom?

03:44.325 --> 03:47.060
Son, this is not the bathroom!
Shut the door, Mom.

03:47.127 --> 03:49.397
My living room's not a toilet!

03:53.634 --> 03:56.103
That's a good story, Mom,
but that was bad Earl.

03:56.169 --> 03:58.572
I was kinda hopin' we could
focus on good Earl tonight.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.641
You know, the one
who fixes things.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.610
Well, there's only been
one year of good Earl.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.978
I'm not sure we'd have
enough to talk about.
[ Chuckles ]

04:07.281 --> 04:10.951
Hey, Willie, why don't you show
my mom what's under your patch.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.857
Oh, God.
It looks like there's
a little raisin in there.

04:18.426 --> 04:21.962
Hey, look, Earl.
I'm an alcoholic hamster.

04:22.029 --> 04:25.666
You gotta do that
for Mr. Turtle.
He's gonna laugh and laugh.

04:25.733 --> 04:28.068
Hey, Randy was just
tellin' me about the pranks
you used to pull.

04:28.135 --> 04:31.572
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I've done some bad things.
I'm aware of that.

04:31.639 --> 04:34.342
I've written 'em down.
But I've done some
good things too.

04:34.408 --> 04:37.378
I raised your son
for five years.
Let's not forget about that.

04:37.445 --> 04:39.413
Oh, I remember.

04:39.480 --> 04:43.351
Although it's a miracle
I remember anything after
that time you got me stoned.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.489
[ Earl Narrating ]
Before Darnell was making
his famous lemon squares,

04:48.556 --> 04:52.493
he used to make
some pretty famous brownies
and sell 'em on Thursday nights.

04:54.862 --> 04:59.032
It bein' the Crab Shack,
the only brownies that sold
were the $5 ones.

04:59.099 --> 05:02.636
Me and Randy weren't into pot,
but we were into money.

05:06.707 --> 05:10.010
[ Chuckles ]
My man. Hook me up.

05:10.077 --> 05:13.113
[ Earl Narrating ] The plan was
for me and Randy to buy all
the 25-cent brownies...

05:13.180 --> 05:16.149
at the end of the night
and sell 'em somewhere else.

05:16.216 --> 05:21.121
Like every Thursday night,
the quarter brownies
didn't sell.

05:21.188 --> 05:24.492
And also like
every Thursday night,
me and Randy drank so much,

05:24.558 --> 05:26.894
we passed out
on the pool table.

05:26.960 --> 05:30.798
So we never got a chance
to buy the real pot brownies.

05:30.864 --> 05:33.033
I'm glad the regular brownies
didn't sell.

05:33.100 --> 05:37.037
That way, me and my grandmoms
can eat all these brownies
and play Scrabble tonight.

05:37.104 --> 05:40.307
We share a sweet tooth
and a love of language.

05:40.374 --> 05:42.910
[ Earl Narrating ]
And I certainly didn't mean
to get him stoned like this.

05:42.976 --> 05:46.480
Hey, man.
You sold us pot brownies
with no pot in them.

05:46.547 --> 05:49.617
I just sat through dinner
with my parents straight.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.585
I haven't done that
since I was 13!

05:51.652 --> 05:54.221
I listened to
a whole Phish album!

05:54.287 --> 05:56.957
And it sucked!

05:57.024 --> 06:01.094
[ Narrating ] I certainly didn't
want it to happen like this.
Ow!

06:01.161 --> 06:02.930
It was Biblical.

06:02.996 --> 06:06.333
Okay, then.
Uh, I'm gonna go fire up
the karaoke.

06:06.400 --> 06:09.770
[ Narrating ] Even though the
crowd wasn't nearly drunk enough
to make karaoke entertaining,

06:09.837 --> 06:13.607
I knew it would at least
stop people from reminding me
of all the bad stuff I'd done.

06:13.674 --> 06:16.677
Okay, uh,
who wants to go first?

06:16.744 --> 06:21.381
Maybe sing, uh, I don't know,
"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow"?

06:21.449 --> 06:24.184
Donny Jones.
Can you come sing for us?

06:24.251 --> 06:28.355

- Anything you want.

so we could spend more
precious years together.

[ Narrating ] It was bad enough
people were tellin' me about
the terrible stuff I had done.

07:13.033 --> 07:17.237
Now Donny was singin'
about how I almost got him
killed by a fern.

07:17.304 --> 07:21.174
I didn't set out to get
Donny hurt. I set out
to help a pregnant Joy...

07:21.241 --> 07:23.544
who wasn't feelin' good
about how she looked.

07:23.611 --> 07:25.646
What are you hens
cluckin' about?

07:25.713 --> 07:28.248
Some more of that blue ice
drop from the sky again?

07:28.315 --> 07:31.318
I swear, those pilots
see a trailer park
and just pull the chute.

07:31.384 --> 07:33.887
There's a Peeping Tom
runnin' around.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.389
Mm-hmm. He likes
to watch people do it.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.526
He saw Jill doin' it
with Doug.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.928
He saw Karen doin' it
with clamps on her nubbies.

07:40.994 --> 07:44.064
Hey!
That's okay. He saw me doin' it
with clamps on my nubbies too.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.099
Thanks for lettin' me borrow
your nubbie clamps.

07:46.166 --> 07:49.136
No attractive woman is safe.
I'm sure he's peeped you
too, Joy.

07:49.202 --> 07:52.640
Oh, yeah. He's at
my window all the time...

07:52.706 --> 07:55.909
'cause I'm so pregnant
and... hot.

07:57.344 --> 07:59.046
Oh, no!

07:59.112 --> 08:01.749
I left my binoculars
and a six-pack of beer...

08:01.815 --> 08:05.519
on the comfy chair
right outside our window!

08:05.586 --> 08:09.356
But I'm just too horny now
to go and get them!

08:09.422 --> 08:12.125
You put my comfy chair
outside?

08:13.527 --> 08:17.197
I had to, Earl.
There's a perv out there
not peepin' on me,

08:17.264 --> 08:19.700
and I want him peepin' on me,
even if it takes all night.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.702
I went to Spencer's Gifts
and got us some crazy stuff,

08:21.769 --> 08:23.704
but we're gonna have to
do it near an outlet.

08:23.771 --> 08:27.675
[ Narrating ] I knew no matter
what we did and no matter
what weird gadgets Joy bought,

08:27.741 --> 08:29.677
that perv wasn't gonna
show up...

08:29.743 --> 08:31.979
'cause that perv was me.

08:32.045 --> 08:34.582
But I wasn't actually
peepin' on people.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.984
I'd seen some kids playing
in a big-screen TV box,

08:37.050 --> 08:40.220
and was tryin' to find out
who bought it
so I could steal it.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.725
[ Screaming ]

08:44.792 --> 08:46.560
[ Earl Narrating ]
I wasn't gonna tell Joy
it was me...

08:46.627 --> 08:49.897
'cause I went from havin'
zero sex with a tired,
pregnant woman...

08:49.963 --> 08:53.000
to havin' lots of sex
with an angry, pregnant woman
on a mission.

08:53.066 --> 08:55.836
We're gonna do stuff
from the Kama Sutra,

08:55.903 --> 08:58.005
where I sit cross-legged
and wiggle...

08:58.071 --> 09:01.575
while you hold it for two hours,
like Sting does.

09:01.642 --> 09:06.580
Get that oil out.
We're not stoppin' this love bus
until the baby tugs on the cord.

09:06.647 --> 09:09.382
It's time for spankings.
But not for our kids.

09:09.449 --> 09:11.885
We're good parents.
We use time-outs.

09:11.952 --> 09:16.556
It's time for Mama's spanking,
'cause I've been a bad girl!

09:16.624 --> 09:18.425
[ Earl Narrating ]
It was fun at first.

09:18.491 --> 09:21.028
But after a week of still not
gettin' peeped at, she gave up.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.196
I got the sex swing
bolted back
in the ceiling.

09:23.263 --> 09:27.735
This time I'm sure I hit a stud.
That makes two studs
in the house.

09:27.801 --> 09:30.671
Forget it, Earl.
He doesn't care about me.

09:30.738 --> 09:34.675
I mean, how bad do you have
to be to get passed over
by a trailer-park perv?

09:37.745 --> 09:42.182
Well, maybe if we brought
another girl in,
that might do the trick.

09:45.085 --> 09:49.356
[ Earl Narrating ] Layin' there,
horny on the ground, I knew
I had to come up with a plan.

09:49.422 --> 09:54.161
So I paid my friend
Donny Jones to peep and run.
I knew he'd be perfect,

09:54.227 --> 09:57.064
'cause even when he just
looked at women normal,
it creeped 'em out.

10:02.069 --> 10:04.838
Hey! It's him!

10:04.905 --> 10:07.174
He's peepin' me!
He's peepin' me!

10:07.240 --> 10:10.944
[ Earl Narrating ]
The peep part worked out fine.
The runnin' part didn't.

10:11.011 --> 10:13.280
Ow! Ow!

10:13.346 --> 10:16.316
This is for peepin' me before
I finished Jenny Craig!

10:17.885 --> 10:20.688
I forgot about
that fern thing.

10:20.754 --> 10:23.691
Donny showed me where he's got
a piece of that terra-cotta
underneath his scalp.

10:23.757 --> 10:26.226
It's, like, this big,
shaped like Texas.

10:26.293 --> 10:29.062
It's half that big, okay?
And he should be thankin' me.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.765
It's the only thing
he has to talk about,
other than his Bible.

10:31.832 --> 10:34.001
Besides, the whole thing
started with me tryin'...

10:34.067 --> 10:37.037
to make you feel better
about yourself
when you were pregnant.

10:37.104 --> 10:39.206
Please.
You were horrible.

10:39.272 --> 10:42.409

goin' home. I'd had enough.

on the back was me.

it was mean words
