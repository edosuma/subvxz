00:04.800 --> 00:05.959
I see them too.

00:05.960 --> 00:09.960
What are they? They're demons.

00:14.320 --> 00:15.599
If the body they're in dies,

00:15.600 --> 00:18.840
they possess the nearest
person they can find.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
How do I get him out of her?
You have to perform an exorcism.

00:25.440 --> 00:26.799
Hello, Raquel.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.119
Who was that guy? Who is he?

00:29.120 --> 00:33.120
He's just a guy I know.

00:33.200 --> 00:37.200
Deficit fumus deficiant et jus...

00:42.400 --> 00:46.400
Suzanne?

00:46.960 --> 00:48.959
She's dead.

01:26.280 --> 01:27.479
You're buying Tango?

01:27.480 --> 01:28.839
That's our cover story.

01:28.840 --> 01:32.840
We're just two innocent girls
buying some pop.

01:38.920 --> 01:41.559
They don't have any spades,
not that I can see.

01:41.560 --> 01:44.039
This is about the best I could find.

01:44.040 --> 01:47.679
You want to dig a grave with spoons?

01:47.680 --> 01:49.439
Spoons? Big spoons.

01:49.440 --> 01:51.119
Serving spoons.

01:51.120 --> 01:53.279
It's not ideal but...

01:53.280 --> 01:54.999
OK. It's totally ridiculous.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
Maybe they have some out back.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.519
Hey. How's it going? It's great.

02:02.520 --> 02:05.599
It's all good.
Just getting some supplies.

02:05.600 --> 02:08.919
We needed some Tango so....

02:08.919 --> 02:11.159
You need anything else? Mmm.

02:11.160 --> 02:15.160
Do you sell spades?

02:18.320 --> 02:22.320
You come in here in the middle
of the night, asking for spades.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.079
Right. Major alarm bells.

02:24.080 --> 02:28.079
I'm talking sirens, flashing lights,
helicopters in the sky.

02:28.080 --> 02:32.080
Who are you burying?

02:33.080 --> 02:35.679
I'm screwing with you...

02:35.680 --> 02:37.799
I'm sorry. Your faces.

02:37.800 --> 02:40.799
That is hilarious.

02:40.800 --> 02:44.279
They're in aisle 11.
How many do you need?

02:44.280 --> 02:46.599
Two.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.159
Two spades to the checkout, please.

02:49.160 --> 02:53.160
That's two spades to the checkout.

02:53.560 --> 02:57.560
Two spades to the checkout.

02:59.160 --> 03:01.239
They shouldn't be too long.

03:01.240 --> 03:05.240
You guys got any plans for
the rest of the night?

03:23.240 --> 03:26.879
Do you have any preferences
where we bury her?

03:26.880 --> 03:30.399
Maybe a place you two
liked to hang out?

03:30.400 --> 03:32.119
You mean like a coffee shop?

03:32.120 --> 03:34.999
Probably not a coffee shop.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
The forest is always a good option.
Lots of trees...

03:40.400 --> 03:41.959
You said she'd be OK.

03:41.960 --> 03:45.559
I don't understand it.
She should have been fine.

03:45.560 --> 03:49.560
You don't have a clue.
You have no idea what you're doing.

03:50.240 --> 03:52.199
This is on you.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.719
I screwed up.

03:53.720 --> 03:56.319
I get it.

03:56.320 --> 04:00.320
Sorry.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.399
I know you're upset, and angry...
You have no idea.

04:03.400 --> 04:07.400
If we don't bury her, we're
going to be eating prison food

04:08.920 --> 04:12.920
and prison... pussy
for the rest of our lives.

04:16.519 --> 04:19.519
They do not have a salad bar,

04:19.519 --> 04:21.439
or a Nando's.

04:21.440 --> 04:22.959
Uh-uh.

04:22.960 --> 04:26.960
Let's go with the forest.

04:28.120 --> 04:30.159
So is it like a cycling club?

04:30.160 --> 04:34.160
Well, it's not really a... club.
It's just a group of guys

04:34.400 --> 04:37.239
who like to blow off some
steam at the weekends.

04:37.240 --> 04:41.240
Last Saturday, some dick in a BMW
clipped Aaron's wheel.

04:41.760 --> 04:43.799
Arsehole won't be doing that again.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.839
Look at you getting
your hands dirty.

04:45.840 --> 04:46.879
I'm not above it.

04:46.880 --> 04:50.880
It's good for the soul.

04:51.880 --> 04:54.279
So this is who all the
fuss is about?

04:54.280 --> 04:55.559
She's cute.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.999
The situation's got
a little out of hand.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.719
Do you, er, do you think you
can take care of her?

05:00.720 --> 05:04.720
Sure, just so long as I
can get childcare.

05:04.800 --> 05:07.879
I'll see if my baby-sitter can stay
on for an extra couple of hours.

05:07.880 --> 05:10.879
Are you telling me the future of
our kind hangs on whether your

05:10.880 --> 05:12.759
baby-sitter fancies some overtime?

05:12.760 --> 05:13.879
Trust me.

05:13.880 --> 05:17.279
This is the last time
I possess a single mum.

05:17.280 --> 05:19.599
It's relentless.
There's no support.

05:19.600 --> 05:22.440
Hey. How's my boy?

05:23.920 --> 05:27.920
Oh. Well, there should be some cough
medicine in the bathroom cabinet.

05:29.960 --> 05:33.960
OK. Something's come up.

05:34.080 --> 05:37.439
Could you stay on for an
extra couple of hours?

05:37.440 --> 05:41.440
Three?

05:41.760 --> 05:45.760
You're a total star.

We didn't mean to.

06:17.240 --> 06:21.240

No.

07:42.080 --> 07:46.080
I'm so sorry. You poor little thing.
I'm sorry.

07:50.480 --> 07:52.399
Now you start crying?

07:52.400 --> 07:56.400
It's like in Watership Down,
when Hazel dies,

07:56.640 --> 08:00.239
and Fiver goes looking for him
but it's too late.

08:00.240 --> 08:01.999
Hazel's dead.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
Nothing in the rabbit warren
will ever be the same.

08:07.520 --> 08:08.919
There's your rabbit!

08:08.920 --> 08:12.920
That was a horrible thing to do.
We just buried my best friend!

08:14.680 --> 08:17.159
I thought she'd be OK.

08:17.160 --> 08:21.160
I thought we'd exorcise her and the
three of us would be friends,

08:22.040 --> 08:23.839
and hang out together,

08:23.840 --> 08:27.039
and we'd all have shiny hair,
and amazing skin,

08:27.040 --> 08:31.040
all glossy, and happy,
and smelling really good...

08:50.880 --> 08:54.880
I guess that was bound to
happen eventually.

08:55.880 --> 08:58.159
There's no way a taxi's going
to come and get us

08:58.160 --> 09:00.639
all the way out here.

09:00.640 --> 09:03.439
Do you have any friends?

09:03.440 --> 09:07.440
Friends who are alive and
extremely gullible?

09:08.440 --> 09:11.279
Hungry Like The Wolf Duran Duran

09:11.280 --> 09:13.719
Oh, I see you,

09:13.720 --> 09:16.599
your beautiful, pale face,

09:16.600 --> 09:20.600
looking radiant in the moonlight.

09:23.720 --> 09:27.039
What do we say when he asks us
what we're doing out here?

09:27.040 --> 09:29.359
We tell him we're lesbians.

09:29.360 --> 09:32.719
Lesbians who like it rough
and dirty in a forest.

09:32.720 --> 09:36.720
Lesbians who like a
pine-fresh scent.

09:41.160 --> 09:45.039
Hey. Hi. Who's your friend?

09:45.040 --> 09:47.119
Raquel, this is Jake.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.359
Well, any friend
of Amy's is a friend,

09:49.360 --> 09:51.559
and potential
sexual partner, of mine.

09:51.560 --> 09:54.479
The more the merrier.

09:54.480 --> 09:56.959
Are you getting in, or are you
just going to stand there

09:56.960 --> 10:00.960
like a pair of lesbians?

10:25.640 --> 10:26.959
Hello.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.960
What were you guys doing
out here anyway?

10:32.800 --> 10:36.800
Amy likes the smell of trees.

10:37.240 --> 10:40.759
You were sniffing trees?

10:40.760 --> 10:44.760
That is just about the worst
lie I've ever heard.

10:44.880 --> 10:47.679
It's ridiculous. See, the thing is

10:47.680 --> 10:51.680
now you've got my
imagination running riot.

10:52.520 --> 10:54.959
And you don't want that.

10:54.960 --> 10:58.960
Ever.

11:05.440 --> 11:07.039
Do you want to come inside?

11:07.040 --> 11:08.999
I just want to go home.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.439
Or you could come back to mine.

11:12.440 --> 11:15.039
Always an option.
Just putting that out there.

11:15.040 --> 11:19.040
We should talk, get our ducks in
a row about what happened earlier.

11:20.320 --> 11:24.320
OK. Just for a minute.

11:24.360 --> 11:28.360
I'll wait here and then I want to
hear all about these ducks, yeah.

11:37.240 --> 11:39.999
If anyone asks,
Suzanne's gone travelling.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.559
India, Nepal, other bullshit
places people go to jerk off

11:43.560 --> 11:47.560
and discover themselves.

11:50.200 --> 11:52.719
You need to pack for her,
stuff she'd take -

11:52.720 --> 11:55.799
passport, bikini,
feminine hygiene products.

11:55.800 --> 11:58.719
My brother doesn't know about
any of this stuff, OK?

11:58.720 --> 12:02.720
He fancies you, so he's probably
just thinking about his dick.

12:05.520 --> 12:06.919
Tyler?

12:06.920 --> 12:10.920
In the kitchen. Your friend's here.

12:27.760 --> 12:35.000
Hi.

12:34.271 --> 12:36.670
What is he doing here? What does
he want? - I don't know.

12:36.671 --> 12:39.750
You are so obviously lying.

12:39.751 --> 12:42.990
You need to get my brother out of
the way while I talk to him.

12:42.991 --> 12:46.991
And how am I supposed to do that?

12:49.951 --> 12:52.990
I am not having sex with your
brother just so you can have a chat

12:52.991 --> 12:54.990
with this guy. You obviously
like him.

12:54.991 --> 12:57.670
Flick the fast-forward switch and
get to the jiggy bit.

12:57.671 --> 13:00.270
Maybe I'd like to get to know
him first. Do that after.

13:00.271 --> 13:02.670
Flip it on its head.
Flip my brother's head.

13:02.671 --> 13:04.670
I did not sign up for this.

13:04.671 --> 13:07.830
You're going to have to learn how to
think on your feet,

13:07.831 --> 13:09.790
roll with the punches...

13:09.791 --> 13:11.950
and other metaphors. You're part of
this thing now.

13:11.951 --> 13:13.950
No. No, I'm not. I work in a
bowling alley.

13:13.951 --> 13:17.030
Do you? Yes.
I have a shift tomorrow, at one.

13:17.031 --> 13:19.950
Good luck with that.

13:19.951 --> 13:23.951
Who is this guy? OK.

13:24.071 --> 13:25.910
I really needed that.

13:25.911 --> 13:28.110
We both did. Mmm.

13:28.111 --> 13:31.150
They didn't do a very good job on
your nails, then, did they?

13:31.151 --> 13:34.390
You said you were going to a nail bar.
Looks like you've been digging in dirt.

13:34.391 --> 13:35.910
We were digging for worms.

13:35.911 --> 13:38.750
OK, any particular reason why?

13:38.751 --> 13:42.310
Amy likes to fish in the river.

13:42.311 --> 13:44.990
Really? I didn't know there were
fish in there.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.470
What did you catch?

13:46.471 --> 13:47.790
Goldfish... Mm.

13:47.791 --> 13:49.710
..starfish...

13:49.711 --> 13:51.110
cod.

13:51.111 --> 13:55.111
Anything with scales, gills...

13:55.271 --> 13:56.590
..flippers.

13:56.591 --> 13:59.990
Here's an idea, why don't you show
Amy your bedroom?

13:59.991 --> 14:02.590
Hmm. Because that would be
very weird.

14:02.591 --> 14:04.550
She was just saying on the way
over here

14:04.551 --> 14:08.390
how much she would like to
see it. Weren't you, Amy?

14:08.391 --> 14:09.910
I was.

14:09.911 --> 14:11.990
I am itching to see it.

14:11.991 --> 14:15.030
Well, don't just stand there,
like an enormous limp dick.

14:15.031 --> 14:18.990
Ask her. Would you like to see my
bedroom, Amy?

14:18.991 --> 14:20.990
I would love to see your bedroom.

14:20.991 --> 14:24.390
Go on, then. Enjoy.

14:24.391 --> 14:28.391
OK. Erm, it's this way.

14:31.511 --> 14:34.910
You think you can just turn up
at my home?

14:34.911 --> 14:36.870
That is not OK.

14:36.871 --> 14:39.310
I should crack your skull
like an egg.

14:39.311 --> 14:41.110
You're in danger. Really?

14:41.111 --> 14:44.550
No shit.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.830
And whose fault is that?

14:47.831 --> 14:50.750
My fault. That's right.

14:50.751 --> 14:52.590
It's all your fault.

14:52.591 --> 14:56.591
I'm glad we're both clear on that.

14:58.591 --> 15:01.030
Don't...

15:01.031 --> 15:04.190
Don't look at me like that.

15:04.191 --> 15:08.191
So, this is where the magic happens.

15:08.351 --> 15:10.070
And by "magic", I mean sleeping.

15:10.071 --> 15:11.950
Mainly sleeping.

15:11.951 --> 15:14.190
Nice.

15:14.191 --> 15:15.910
It's very roomy.

15:15.911 --> 15:17.790
Room to swing a cat...

15:17.791 --> 15:20.990
or a dog.

15:20.991 --> 15:23.630
A small pony if you wanted to.

15:23.631 --> 15:27.631
Shetland.

15:27.751 --> 15:29.470
That guy, Sawyer.

15:29.471 --> 15:32.110
There was a really weird
atmosphere between him and Raquel.

15:32.111 --> 15:34.470
Is he Raquel's boyfriend?

15:34.471 --> 15:35.790
Could be.

15:35.791 --> 15:38.590
She's asked you not to tell me,
hasn't she?

15:38.591 --> 15:41.230
So secretive. I mean, he was
desperate to see her.

15:41.231 --> 15:44.470
Do you think I did the wrong thing
by letting him wait? No.

15:44.471 --> 15:47.590
I'm glad you and Raquel
are mates.

15:47.591 --> 15:50.710
I mean, she'd kill me for saying it,
but she

15:50.711 --> 15:53.230
doesn't find it easy connecting
with people.

15:53.231 --> 15:55.470
I got that.

15:55.471 --> 15:59.471
So, that's the tour.

15:59.671 --> 16:03.630
I haven't offered you a beer.
Do you want a beer? No.

16:03.631 --> 16:06.630
No, thank you.

16:06.631 --> 16:09.510
I'm going to go and get my beer.
Don't.

16:09.511 --> 16:13.511
I'll be back. Got you!

16:20.671 --> 16:23.150
Should I kiss you? This is fine.

16:23.151 --> 16:24.910
Really?

16:24.911 --> 16:26.670
Don't move.

16:26.671 --> 16:30.670
This is how I like it.

16:30.671 --> 16:32.990
Oh, yeah.

16:32.991 --> 16:36.750
This is really working for me.

16:36.751 --> 16:39.430
Eh. Yeah. Me, too.

16:39.431 --> 16:41.750
Yeah, this is...

16:41.751 --> 16:43.630
This is great.

16:43.631 --> 16:45.630
I know how you feel about me.

16:45.631 --> 16:47.510
Maybe that's never going to change.

16:47.511 --> 16:49.630
But you have to listen to me.

16:49.631 --> 16:52.310
I heard something. Yeah,
what's that?

16:52.311 --> 16:56.110
This demon guy, he's a real nasty
shit, he's coming after you.

16:56.111 --> 16:58.590
Why?

16:58.591 --> 17:00.950
Because of who you are.

17:00.951 --> 17:04.951
Relax
by Frankie Goes To Hollywood

17:05.271 --> 17:09.271
Ooh!

17:22.790 --> 17:26.510
Ah!

17:26.511 --> 17:28.190
Ohh!

17:28.191 --> 17:31.590
Ah!

17:31.591 --> 17:32.630
Ohh!

17:32.631 --> 17:35.230
So, what am I supposed to do?

17:35.231 --> 17:38.470
You remember that place we used to
go to, out in the woods?

17:38.471 --> 17:40.710
You mean that shitty old house?

17:40.711 --> 17:42.710
That's not how I remember it.

17:42.711 --> 17:45.470
We had some great times there.

17:45.471 --> 17:48.390
We should go and stay there.

17:48.391 --> 17:50.910
Just while we figure out what's
going on. You'll be safe there.

17:50.911 --> 17:53.150
If you want to take a trip down
memory lane,

17:53.151 --> 17:55.350
you're doing it on your own. - I'm
trying to protect you.

17:55.351 --> 17:59.351
I don't need you to protect me.
I never have.

17:59.711 --> 18:01.430
Leave me alone.

18:01.431 --> 18:03.071
You know I can't do that.

18:06.231 --> 18:08.030
It's them.

18:08.031 --> 18:10.431
Raquel?

18:14.431 --> 18:17.590
What's happened? - Oh, I don't know.
All the lights went out.

18:17.591 --> 18:20.910
All right. I'll go check the fuses.

18:20.911 --> 18:23.670
I'll draw them away,
you lock the doors.

18:23.671 --> 18:27.671
Do not go out there.

18:46.911 --> 18:50.911
If you want to go after him,
maybe you should.

19:03.871 --> 19:06.590
What was that?

19:06.591 --> 19:08.190
It's foxes.

19:08.191 --> 19:10.030
Foxes having sex.

19:10.031 --> 19:12.710
They have barbs...

19:12.711 --> 19:14.870
..on their dicks.

19:14.871 --> 19:18.871
It's a basic design flaw.

19:24.871 --> 19:25.950
I have to go.

19:25.951 --> 19:28.310

20:00.871 --> 20:02.710
No!

20:02.711 --> 20:05.510
You take your clothes off

20:05.511 --> 20:07.910
I'm coming back for this bad boy.

20:07.911 --> 20:11.911
We'll flick the switch and
fast-forward to the jiggy bit.

20:12.831 --> 20:16.831
OK.

20:22.551 --> 20:26.551
It's OK. Even you pussies should be

drive us somewhere.

21:24.031 --> 21:26.670
Where?
- I'll give you directions as we go.

21:26.671 --> 21:30.671
Oh, all very intriguing
and mysterious.

21:38.031 --> 21:39.910
We're kind of in a hurry.

21:39.911 --> 21:43.911
Er, kind of in a hurry to get in a
traffic accident.

21:56.569 --> 21:59.128
You need to drive faster.
Drive faster!

21:59.129 --> 22:01.368
You know, it would help
if I knew where we were going.

22:01.369 --> 22:05.369
We're not exactly sure. Just drive.

22:05.409 --> 22:06.968
OK, slow down, slow down.

22:06.969 --> 22:10.288
Faster, slower... What is this?

22:10.289 --> 22:14.289
Take the next left.

22:17.009 --> 22:20.128
So, we're obviously
following this van.

22:20.129 --> 22:23.168
What van?
There - the van we're following.

22:23.169 --> 22:27.169
Is there a van? Oh... hadn't noticed.

22:28.929 --> 22:30.688
Right? Uh... think so.

22:30.689 --> 22:33.208
Oh, OK - you two need
to start telling me

22:33.209 --> 22:35.568
why we're following this suspicious,
rapey-looking van.

22:35.569 --> 22:37.208
It's better if we don't tell you.

22:37.209 --> 22:39.608
Better for who, eh?
Cos I'm not loving it.

22:39.609 --> 22:41.128
Friends, we tell each other things.

22:41.129 --> 22:45.088
There's an exchange of information
leading to intimacy.

22:45.089 --> 22:46.369
Go left.

22:48.409 --> 22:49.488
OK.

22:49.489 --> 22:52.928
So, sometimes,
if I've run out of toilet paper,

22:52.929 --> 22:55.368
I use sliced bread to clean myself.

22:55.369 --> 22:57.688
If I've run out of that,
I used slices of ham.

22:57.689 --> 23:00.568
It's like a poor man's wet wipe.

23:00.569 --> 23:01.928
I'm sharing that with you.

23:01.929 --> 23:04.768
I really wish you hadn't.
Hey, it ain't always pretty.

23:04.769 --> 23:06.848
Don't get too close.
You're too close!

23:06.849 --> 23:08.728
Too close to the van
we're not following?!

23:08.729 --> 23:11.568
You wouldn't believe us,
even if we told you.

23:11.569 --> 23:13.208
OK.

23:13.209 --> 23:17.209
Fine - you're obviously in
some kind of trouble, so...

23:19.849 --> 23:22.368
Whatever it is, I'm in.

23:22.369 --> 23:24.448
Always running towards the flames.

23:24.449 --> 23:28.449
Head down, balls out.

23:33.809 --> 23:37.809
Oh, the ice rink, eh?

23:55.409 --> 23:57.408
Some bad memories of this place.

23:57.409 --> 24:01.409
I was attempting a one-and-a-half
flip-tuck axel stag jump.

24:01.489 --> 24:05.489
Execution was beautiful.

24:05.769 --> 24:06.968
Till I landed.

24:06.969 --> 24:09.008
Shattered my wrist.

24:09.009 --> 24:11.888
If you listen carefully,
you can still hear it click.

24:11.889 --> 24:13.488
You hear that?

24:13.489 --> 24:15.048
A lot of people thought
I was on my way

24:15.049 --> 24:16.728
to being the greatest
figure skater

24:16.729 --> 24:20.288
this country's ever known.

24:20.289 --> 24:24.289
So... what are these guys doing here,
anyway?

24:24.969 --> 24:28.969
It's Raquel's boyfriend.
She thinks he's cheating on her.

24:30.609 --> 24:33.408
With members of his ice hockey team.

24:33.409 --> 24:35.808
Oh, man!

24:35.809 --> 24:38.208
No-one likes to think
of their boyfriend being bummed

24:38.209 --> 24:41.488
by a gang of butch
ice hockey players.

24:41.489 --> 24:44.328
Do you reckon they keep those gloves
on when they're doing it?

24:44.329 --> 24:46.848
That's a... weird
and disturbing image.

24:46.849 --> 24:48.848
I'm going in. You should wait here.

24:48.849 --> 24:50.088
Really? Are you sure?

24:50.089 --> 24:52.648
You want to see your boyfriend
getting effed up the A?

24:52.649 --> 24:55.489
On ice?

24:56.929 --> 25:00.929
Big gloves pushing your face down.

25:01.929 --> 25:03.808
Cold on your cheek.

25:03.809 --> 25:07.809
Rough leather gloves
on your naked back.

25:09.449 --> 25:11.328
Searing pain in your rectum.

25:11.329 --> 25:13.448
Raquel!

25:13.449 --> 25:15.248
Wait...

25:15.249 --> 25:16.648
Raquel!

25:16.649 --> 25:18.408
I thought I told you
to wait inside the car.

25:18.409 --> 25:19.888
Well, turns out waiting in the car

25:19.889 --> 25:21.648
isn't really an option any more,
is it?

25:21.649 --> 25:25.048
It is, if you're just a girl
who works in a bowling alley.

25:25.049 --> 25:28.488
Part of me wants to just be a girl
who works in a bowling alley.

25:28.489 --> 25:29.568
But then I met you.

25:29.569 --> 25:32.728
You made me realise
I wasn't totally crazy.

25:32.729 --> 25:35.408
So now, I am running
towards the flames.

25:35.409 --> 25:38.408
Head down, balls out.

25:38.409 --> 25:40.488
Balls out.

25:40.489 --> 25:42.288
It's a good look for you.

25:42.289 --> 25:44.448
If I'm going balls out,

25:44.449 --> 25:46.409
you need to tell me who this guy is.

25:47.729 --> 25:49.728
Why can't you just admit
you were shagging him?

25:49.729 --> 25:51.208
Say it - you shagged him,
didn't you?

25:51.209 --> 25:54.968
He's my dad.

25:54.969 --> 25:57.888
He's my demon dad.

25:57.889 --> 25:59.928
He's your dad.

25:59.929 --> 26:01.808
That guy?

26:01.809 --> 26:03.128
Seriously?

26:03.129 --> 26:06.128
He possessed my real dad,
and jizzed inside my mum.

26:06.129 --> 26:08.528
My mum got pregnant with me...

26:08.529 --> 26:09.688
So, now you know.

26:09.689 --> 26:13.689
That means you're...

26:13.849 --> 26:17.849
You're...

26:20.129 --> 26:21.448
If he's...

26:21.449 --> 26:25.449
And he's your dad, then you're...

26:25.689 --> 26:29.689
Half-demon.

26:34.129 --> 26:37.449
When I hit puberty,
I started seeing him.

26:49.809 --> 26:51.808
I thought I was crazy.

26:51.809 --> 26:55.809
Always told me that he loved me,
could never accept it - accept him.

26:56.849 --> 27:00.648
After my dad died,
he jumped bodies and came back.

27:00.649 --> 27:02.688
Why didn't you tell me?
You should have told me.

27:02.689 --> 27:04.528
What? "Oh, hi, I'm Raquel."

27:04.529 --> 27:06.848
"I'm the bastard daughter
of a demon."

27:06.849 --> 27:08.688
I didn't want to lie to you.

27:08.689 --> 27:11.368
I hate to point out
the obvious contradiction.

27:11.369 --> 27:13.848
You hunt demons.
You're one of them.

27:13.849 --> 27:15.369
Or half a one.

27:19.769 --> 27:22.208
All the time I was growing up,
I felt like a freak.

27:22.209 --> 27:23.648
It ruined my life.

27:23.649 --> 27:24.888
Ugh! Oh!

27:24.889 --> 27:26.888
I thought if I could stop that
happening

27:26.889 --> 27:28.688
to just one other person....

27:28.689 --> 27:30.048
Oh! Agh!

27:30.049 --> 27:31.728
..that would be something.

27:31.729 --> 27:33.809
Something good could come out of it.

27:40.929 --> 27:43.168
You hate demons. I get it.

27:43.169 --> 27:47.169
Pretty sure he does, too.

28:01.289 --> 28:04.928
Is everything all right?

28:04.929 --> 28:07.848
Mr Snuggles?

28:07.849 --> 28:11.088
Yeah, he's always losing him.

28:11.089 --> 28:14.488
Yeah, that bloody monkey.

28:14.489 --> 28:18.489
Yeah, I swear I could rip
the stuffing right out of him.

28:19.369 --> 28:22.448
Try the toy box?

28:22.449 --> 28:24.088
Yeah, you got him.

28:24.089 --> 28:27.248
OK. No, um...

28:27.249 --> 28:31.249
Hopefully, I shouldn't be
too much longer.

28:32.449 --> 28:35.448
OK, I'll ring you when I'm leaving.

28:35.449 --> 28:39.248
Bye, bye-bye-bye.

28:39.249 --> 28:42.008
Kids, eh?

28:42.009 --> 28:46.009
Drive you nuts.

28:47.729 --> 28:49.848
Why did they bring him
to an ice rink?

28:49.849 --> 28:53.849
Are demons into
figure skating or something?

28:54.249 --> 28:56.248
"Do demons like figure skating?"

28:56.249 --> 28:57.688
Did you really just ask me that?

28:57.689 --> 29:01.689
I'm not familiar
with their leisure pursuits.

29:06.129 --> 29:07.448
They brought him to an ice rink

29:07.449 --> 29:11.449
because they're going to pierce
his heart with a shard of ice.

29:12.049 --> 29:14.688
It's one of the ways they can
send him back to the underworld.

29:14.689 --> 29:18.688
That's close enough.

29:18.689 --> 29:22.689
I need a shard of ice.

29:23.209 --> 29:26.448
How big?

29:26.449 --> 29:29.088
About the size of your dick?

29:29.089 --> 29:33.089
Is your dick big enough
to pierce his heart?

29:34.889 --> 29:37.688
I guess...

29:37.689 --> 29:39.248
Probably.

29:39.249 --> 29:43.249
Get me a big-dick-size shard of ice.

29:43.369 --> 29:47.369
Total lack of respect.

29:48.089 --> 29:52.089
As usual.

29:55.369 --> 29:59.369
Wait here.

30:36.009 --> 30:38.368
Argh! Jeez...!

30:38.369 --> 30:42.369
Ugh!

30:59.249 --> 31:02.608
In your dreams.

31:02.609 --> 31:06.609
OK. Lay him down.

31:13.929 --> 31:17.929
Uh!

31:19.889 --> 31:22.208
Oh!

31:22.209 --> 31:24.728
Looks like we might
have an audience.

31:24.729 --> 31:28.408
No...

31:28.409 --> 31:32.409
Raquel!

31:33.049 --> 31:37.049
Hey, honey. Are you with us?

31:37.169 --> 31:38.888
Hey! Hey.

31:38.889 --> 31:42.888
Oh, there she is.

31:42.889 --> 31:45.488
Keep hold of her.

31:45.489 --> 31:49.489
Guess she's going to find this
kind of upsetting.

31:53.569 --> 31:57.569
Ah...!

31:58.209 --> 32:01.208
You should have run.

32:01.209 --> 32:03.048
I couldn't.

32:03.049 --> 32:06.368
I hate to ruin this beautiful
and touching moment,

32:06.369 --> 32:10.369
but I have to get home
for my baby-sitter.

32:11.129 --> 32:14.649
Oh! That is cold on your knees.

33:05.529 --> 33:07.528
No...!

33:07.529 --> 33:11.529
No!

33:44.489 --> 33:46.408
No... no...

33:46.409 --> 33:47.768
What do I do?

33:47.769 --> 33:51.769
Tell me what I do.

33:53.129 --> 33:56.568
You're special.

33:56.569 --> 34:00.569
You always were.

34:01.289 --> 34:03.768
All I ever wanted was for you
to know I love you.

34:03.769 --> 34:07.769
I know.

34:08.248 --> 34:11.248
Then everything's OK.

34:11.248 --> 34:14.288
No... no...

34:14.289 --> 34:17.648
No, no, no.

34:17.649 --> 34:21.047
You don't try and fight him.

34:21.049 --> 34:24.928
Run.

34:24.929 --> 34:27.447
Run.

34:27.449 --> 34:29.848
No...

34:29.849 --> 34:31.569
No, no...

34:56.208 --> 34:57.769
No...

35:07.538 --> 35:11.538
Busted!

35:16.578 --> 35:20.578
Yeah! Yeah, you'd better run!
You ice hockey bum boys!

35:23.658 --> 35:26.258
Class act!

35:30.098 --> 35:34.098
And no matter how many times I
rejected him, how much I hurt him...

35:38.138 --> 35:40.657
..he always came back.

35:40.658 --> 35:44.658
He never gave up on me.
He wouldn't give up.

35:45.978 --> 35:49.978
Guess being a demon doesn't
necessarily make you a bad dad.

35:50.018 --> 35:54.018
My dad's all human. He's useless,
he really is.

35:54.258 --> 35:58.057
He's always been there.

35:58.058 --> 36:02.058
I'll miss him. It's like when my dad
went to America for work.

36:03.978 --> 36:06.897
He's not bringing me a little
toy plane and a T-shirt

36:06.898 --> 36:08.817
with "I heart New York" on it.

36:08.818 --> 36:12.738
OK, so that wasn't a great parallel.

36:16.018 --> 36:18.817
All this...

36:18.818 --> 36:22.737
That was you, right?
That wasn't him.

36:22.738 --> 36:24.737
Don't know.

36:24.738 --> 36:28.417
It's never happened before.

36:28.418 --> 36:31.137
He always said I was special.

36:31.138 --> 36:35.138
Demons usually make you infertile,
turn you into a big Jaffa.

36:37.538 --> 36:41.057
Maybe that's part of the reason
why they're so pissy.

36:41.058 --> 36:44.977
If he can do it and he's your dad,
it's... In his demon jizz.

36:44.978 --> 36:47.977
I was going to say
it was hereditary, but...

36:47.978 --> 36:51.978
in his demon jizz
is the same thing.

36:52.418 --> 36:56.418
He always had to be careful
not to get angry or upset...

36:58.818 --> 37:01.777
If someone cut him up
when he was driving,

37:01.778 --> 37:05.778
he'd get mad and all the electronics
in the car would get fried.

37:11.738 --> 37:14.497
Hi.

37:14.498 --> 37:18.498
What in the name
of his holy fuckness is going on?

37:25.578 --> 37:28.017
Oh!

37:28.018 --> 37:31.057
Are you OK? Um...

37:31.058 --> 37:34.537
nah, nah.
Not at all. Not remotely.

37:34.538 --> 37:38.537
When I picked you up in the forest -
you're welcome, by the way -

37:38.538 --> 37:42.457
I thought you were just a pair
of tree-loving lesbians.

37:42.458 --> 37:46.458
Tree-loving lesbians, I can get
my head around, but now

37:46.498 --> 37:50.498
you're telling me there are demons
running around all over the place.

38:00.058 --> 38:01.898
This could take a while.

38:06.618 --> 38:09.897
I'm sorry about your dad.

38:09.898 --> 38:13.097
I'm sorry about Suzanne.

38:13.098 --> 38:17.098
Her dying like that...
it's not your fault.

38:17.618 --> 38:20.737
I shouldn't have blamed you.

38:20.738 --> 38:24.697
And I'm sorry I thought you were
a crazy, weird freak.

38:24.698 --> 38:28.698
When did you think I was
a crazy, weird freak?

38:28.978 --> 38:31.297
When I first met you.

38:31.298 --> 38:33.057
Hm.

38:33.058 --> 38:36.057
Well, I'm sorry I thought
you were a wet, delusional,

38:36.058 --> 38:40.058
shitty little princess
with a big spoon face.

38:41.098 --> 38:45.098
OK. Anything else
we need to apologise for?

38:45.258 --> 38:49.258
Think that covers it.

38:49.498 --> 38:53.097
Sure you don't want to come in?
Probably shouldn't.

38:53.098 --> 38:57.098
Your brother's expecting to have sex
with me. Oh, my god!

38:57.538 --> 38:59.297
You only just met him!

38:59.298 --> 39:03.298
You're such a spoon face slut.

39:07.418 --> 39:11.418
Raquel seems nice.
Nice slash totally batshit crazy.

39:15.178 --> 39:18.977
Good you're helping her out
with this... stuff.

39:18.978 --> 39:21.497
Getting yourself out there.

39:21.498 --> 39:24.657
Like a whole new you.
What's that supposed to mean?

39:24.658 --> 39:28.658
It's just... sometimes you're a bit
cold and standoffish. No, I'm not!

39:29.458 --> 39:33.458
Hey, no, you... shy away
from intimacy. It's no biggy.

39:43.938 --> 39:47.938
Sometimes I pick a really long toenail
off and use it as a tooth pick.

39:49.818 --> 39:52.817
Sharing that with you. Why?

39:52.818 --> 39:56.577
Why for the love of God
would you do such a thing?

39:56.578 --> 40:00.578
I mean, that is beyond gross!
You wipe your arse with meat.

40:02.818 --> 40:06.818
Yeah.

40:17.578 --> 40:21.578
Doesn't seem like her. Her?

40:23.618 --> 40:26.257
She's coming along nicely.

40:26.258 --> 40:30.258
Like a sweet cherry tomato
ripening on the vine.

40:32.698 --> 40:34.257
Is Amy with you?

40:34.258 --> 40:38.258
No, she went home,
so you won't be getting any sex.

40:38.338 --> 40:42.338
Sorry she made your balls ache.

40:44.298 --> 40:48.298
You talk to Sawyer?

40:48.418 --> 40:50.817
And, how did it go?

40:50.818 --> 40:53.057
We worked things out.

40:53.058 --> 40:54.617
Kind of.

40:54.618 --> 40:58.618
Great! Great.
I'm really happy for you.

42:19.498 --> 42:23.498
You killed me, you silly bitch!

42:24.858 --> 42:28.097
Suzanne's changed.
Dying's changed her.

42:28.098 --> 42:30.617
She's a blood-sucking monster.
She will suck you dry!

42:30.618 --> 42:34.618
Argh - call me!

42:45.938 --> 42:47.137
What is this?

42:47.138 --> 42:49.137
Pasta with a tomato
and garlic sauce.

42:49.138 --> 42:50.457
Tastes like shit.

42:50.458 --> 42:52.337
Actual shit.
