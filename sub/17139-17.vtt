00:04.320 --> 00:08.450
CROWLEY: <i>This vessel has been warded
with spellwork from the Cage.</i>

00:08.600 --> 00:10.762
I own you.

00:10.920 --> 00:12.490
CASTIEL: <i>Hey, I think I have
a lead on Kelly Kline.</i>

00:12.640 --> 00:14.290
<i>She's with Dagon. Prince of Hell.</i>

00:14.440 --> 00:15.771
<i>In Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.</i>

00:15.920 --> 00:17.001
Eileen Leahy.

00:21.400 --> 00:24.051
Feel free to drop a line,
even if you just want to hang out.

00:24.200 --> 00:26.726
MICK: <i>I did extensive research
at Kendricks.</i>

00:26.920 --> 00:28.604
- It's like our... Exactly.
- Hogwarts?

00:28.760 --> 00:31.081
Great. Who you gonna call? Douchebusters.

00:32.560 --> 00:33.766
Bravo.

00:36.040 --> 00:37.644
SAM: <i>We're working with these people now.</i>

00:37.800 --> 00:39.325
The better they are, the better we are.

00:40.920 --> 00:42.570
DEAN: <i>What did you do to her?</i>
MICK: <i>I had orders.</i>

00:42.720 --> 00:43.881
DEAN: <i>So you killed her?</i>

00:44.040 --> 00:45.326
We'll give you a second chance.

00:45.520 --> 00:47.284
Just don't mess it up.
There won't be a third.

00:52.840 --> 00:56.970
BOY 1: What do you think she wants?
BOY 2: Nothin' good.

01:01.600 --> 01:03.648
Going home for Christmas?

01:03.800 --> 01:05.643
Sorry. Forgot.

01:06.720 --> 01:09.041
I'll be here. As always.

01:20.240 --> 01:22.447
- Gentlemen.
- BOTH: Headmistress.

01:22.640 --> 01:23.971
Come with me.

01:50.680 --> 01:54.207
Timothy, Michael,

01:54.360 --> 01:57.125
you have both conquered many trials
here at Kendricks,

01:58.720 --> 02:01.371
either through natural talent,

02:01.520 --> 02:03.363
or good, old-fashioned hard work.

02:05.080 --> 02:07.048
But today...

02:07.200 --> 02:08.531
Today we'll learn

02:08.680 --> 02:11.411
which of you will matriculate
to the next level of training.

02:12.880 --> 02:16.930
This organization
does important work, gentlemen,

02:17.080 --> 02:21.563
work which allows millions of people
to sleep safely in their beds at night.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.526
But in order to do this work,

02:25.680 --> 02:28.809
to protect those people,

02:29.000 --> 02:32.561
we need cadets
who will employ their skills,

02:32.720 --> 02:36.566
and execute orders without question.

02:40.560 --> 02:41.766
And so...

02:48.880 --> 02:51.884
Only one of you will be leaving this room.

02:56.040 --> 02:57.201
Good luck.

03:17.440 --> 03:20.649
He fought well. He didn't want to die.

03:23.440 --> 03:25.886
Yet the Code demands otherwise.

03:28.560 --> 03:30.608
<i>Well played, Mr. Davies.</i>

03:50.480 --> 03:53.290
<i>So, uh, after we talked,
you went back to Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.</i>

03:53.440 --> 03:59.129
Why? The last place anybody saw
Kelly Kline, so I figured I'd take a look.

03:59.280 --> 04:00.566
And?

04:00.760 --> 04:06.164
And turns out, right after she left,
somebody burned down an old warehouse.

04:06.320 --> 04:07.810
I did some digging.

04:07.960 --> 04:09.166
<i>Check your phone.</i>

04:09.360 --> 04:10.771
Okay.

04:12.760 --> 04:14.842
What are those, security shots?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.603
Oh, yeah, there's Kelly going in.

04:17.079 --> 04:18.649
- Huh?
- Wow.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.680
<i>- Nice work, Eileen.</i>
- Thank you.

04:21.839 --> 04:24.730
Who's the chick with her?
That Pat Benatar wannabe?

04:24.880 --> 04:26.530
Must be Dagon, I guess.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.682
- Yeah.
- Awesome.

04:28.840 --> 04:35.200
Okay, so, Kelly and Dagon go crash
at this place, and then it gets torched.

04:35.360 --> 04:36.725
- Coincidence?
- No.

04:36.920 --> 04:38.206
<i>Hell, no.</i>

04:38.360 --> 04:40.408
All right, well,
what are we lookin' at here?

04:40.560 --> 04:41.766
Working on it.

04:43.080 --> 04:44.286
<i>Go get 'em, Eileen.</i>

04:44.440 --> 04:46.090
That's the plan.

04:48.720 --> 04:50.768
- Bye, Sam.
- Bye.

04:54.880 --> 04:57.281
- Well, that's cute.
- Oh, come on.

04:59.920 --> 05:04.403
I'm just saying, Dean, even with Cass
and every hunter we know working this,

05:04.560 --> 05:06.961
we still got basically nothing.

05:07.160 --> 05:11.802
- At least, you know, maybe Crowley can...
- No, dude, we're not calling Crowley.

05:13.160 --> 05:16.289
Hello, boys. Do come and have a drink.

05:18.640 --> 05:22.486
- Did you break into our house?
- Our house. Men of Letters.

05:22.640 --> 05:25.769
Did you know your key opens
every Chapterhouse in the world?

05:28.160 --> 05:29.969
Well, you did say
you'd give me a second chance.

05:30.120 --> 05:32.600
Yeah, that doesn't mean we wanna hang out.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.091
You here for a reason?

05:34.240 --> 05:37.005
I am, and it's a bit urgent.

05:37.160 --> 05:41.688
Some time ago, the home office recorded
some sort of cosmic shock wave.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.171
<i>Very rare.</i>

05:43.360 --> 05:44.930
<i>- And after a few months of...</i>
- Nephilim.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.920
- You knew?
- Yeah, we knew.

05:49.080 --> 05:51.321
- How?
- Sort of a long story.

05:51.480 --> 05:53.642
Well, I've got time.

05:56.520 --> 06:01.970
Well, Lucifer jacked the President,
and then knocked up his girlfriend.

06:02.120 --> 06:07.001
And now she is on the run with Dagon,
who is a Prince of Hell.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.321
I see.

06:08.480 --> 06:10.289
And you didn't tell me this because...

06:10.440 --> 06:13.284
'Cause it's kind of
a need-to-know kinda thing.

06:13.440 --> 06:17.923
The Devil is having a child!

06:18.080 --> 06:20.481
It seems like something we'd need to know.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.371
- Where is this woman now?
- Not sure.

06:25.520 --> 06:28.126
We had her, trying to help her,
but she, uh...

06:28.320 --> 06:29.526
- We lost her.
- Yeah.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.206
I'm sorry, you had her?
And you let her live?

06:32.360 --> 06:35.648
Look, it's not Kelly's fault, okay?
She didn't know Lucifer was her boyfriend.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.928
Oh, sure, yeah, could happen to anyone.

06:38.120 --> 06:39.804
Plus, she'd agreed to end the pregnancy.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.002
And I guess, she changed her mind.

06:42.160 --> 06:46.688
Even with everything Kelly knew,
it was still her kid. She couldn't.

06:46.880 --> 06:48.848
Then you should have.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.402
You should have shot her between the eyes.
Immediately.

06:52.560 --> 06:54.722
Oh, why?
'Cause that's what you would've done?

06:54.880 --> 06:56.405
Kinda like you killed that werewolf?

06:56.600 --> 06:59.001
'Cause from what I remember,
that really messed you up.

06:59.160 --> 07:00.889
<i>Yeah, 'cause you're so big
on second chances and all.</i>

07:01.040 --> 07:02.246
Yes.

07:03.760 --> 07:07.048
I'm not saying it was gonna be easy,
but the Code demands it.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.248
Oh. "The Code."

07:09.400 --> 07:11.846
This is not some werewolf!

07:12.000 --> 07:13.525
Do you have any idea
what will happen

07:13.680 --> 07:15.011
if this abomination is born?

07:15.240 --> 07:20.280
Mick, we're handling it, all right?
We'll find her.

07:23.440 --> 07:27.161
So, until then, I say we drink.

07:30.520 --> 07:31.885
Dagon.

07:33.800 --> 07:35.802
Dagon. Hear me.

07:36.280 --> 07:37.361
I do, sire.

07:38.600 --> 07:41.410
News of my son. All is well?

07:42.200 --> 07:43.884
As can be expected.

07:44.040 --> 07:47.010
And the, uh, "container"?

07:50.360 --> 07:53.648
<i>She should last as long as needed.</i>

07:53.800 --> 07:55.211
Well, she'd better.

07:55.360 --> 07:57.328
Don't fail me, Dagon.

07:58.480 --> 07:59.811
<i>Not again.</i>

08:07.840 --> 08:11.970
Mick. No one's out there.
If we run, we might not get caught.

08:12.120 --> 08:14.930
- We can go to my father, he'll...
- Close the door, Timothy.

08:18.480 --> 08:22.929
<i>DR. HESS: We need cadets
who'll execute orders without question.</i>

08:25.600 --> 08:26.840
Mick, we have to go.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.765
<i>DR. HESS:
Only one of you will be leaving this room.</i>

08:29.920 --> 08:31.490
Mick?

08:33.440 --> 08:34.770
<i>DR. HESS: Good luck.</i>

08:37.280 --> 08:39.408
I'm sorry.

08:50.480 --> 08:51.686
Uh, What?

08:51.880 --> 08:54.884
You didn't report in last night,
Mr. Davies. Is there a reason?

08:55.040 --> 08:59.284
No, ma'am. No, I was, uh...
Uh, we're still in investigation mode.

08:59.440 --> 09:00.771
<i>I was gonna inform you.</i>

09:00.920 --> 09:04.083
- And the Winchesters?
- Making some progress.

09:07.480 --> 09:08.686
Come in, Mr. Rawlings.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.446
You are aware that Lady Bevell feels
that they are hopeless.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.967
I'm the one cleaning up her mess.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.043
Dr. Hess, last I heard,

09:16.240 --> 09:18.811
you and the rest of the leadership felt
getting the Winchesters

09:18.960 --> 09:20.962
was key to bringing
the American hunters on board.

09:21.160 --> 09:22.525
<i>I'm just trying to make that happen.</i>

09:22.680 --> 09:25.331
Yes, well, things change.

09:26.680 --> 09:27.806
And that means?

09:28.000 --> 09:31.083
This Nephilim...

09:32.640 --> 09:38.204
Something big and bad
is on its way, Mr. Davies.

09:38.360 --> 09:41.170
We need the situation
in America settled. Now.

09:41.320 --> 09:43.607
What? I don't understand.

09:45.760 --> 09:48.809
Then let me make it blisteringly simple.

09:48.960 --> 09:54.649
We don't have time to court
a handful of mangy Colonials, not anymore.

09:55.840 --> 10:00.926
So, either Sam and Dean, and the
rest of their ill-bred lot learn to obey,

10:01.120 --> 10:03.487
or you turn them over to Mr. Ketch.

10:05.240 --> 10:06.890
And start fresh.

10:08.360 --> 10:13.241
- Look, I don't think...
- This is not a discussion, it's an order.

10:14.040 --> 10:15.530
<i>Are you hearing me, Michael?</i>

10:15.680 --> 10:19.401
Assimilate or eliminate.

10:36.400 --> 10:39.404
Do you need a pillow or whatever?

10:43.040 --> 10:44.201
What's wrong?

10:44.360 --> 10:46.727
I keep getting these weird little pains.

10:48.240 --> 10:50.163
I'm sure everything is fine.

10:51.200 --> 10:54.090
Why? Because this is how you felt
all the times you were pregnant?

10:57.040 --> 10:58.246
I need to see a doctor.

10:58.400 --> 11:01.688
No doctor will understand this child.

11:01.840 --> 11:03.171
You barely do.

11:04.920 --> 11:07.048
We've been here too long. We should go.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.247
No.

11:09.720 --> 11:13.247
You said that you would help me.
I wanna see a doctor.

11:18.160 --> 11:20.731
I'm not going anywhere
until I know my baby's safe.

11:33.680 --> 11:35.603
Wow.

11:36.360 --> 11:38.681
<i>- You look like crap.</i>
- Yeah, you look crappier.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.443
I gotta hand it to Mick.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.967
Man, you get him started,
that guy can drink.

11:45.120 --> 11:48.920
I mean, we can drink, but he's got,
like, the "Can Drink" gold medal.

11:49.080 --> 11:51.890
Hey, you talk to Mom, lately?

11:52.040 --> 11:54.805
Oh, I shouldn't worry about your mum.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.530
Her and Ketch make quite the team.

11:56.680 --> 11:58.887
Would you want your mom working with him?

12:00.520 --> 12:03.603
I can't say. I never really knew my mum.

12:04.480 --> 12:05.811
Or my dad.

12:07.320 --> 12:09.209
I was on the streets
till the Men of Letters found me.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.124
And how did they find you?

12:13.200 --> 12:16.204
I, uh, picked a member's pocket.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.600
Not on purpose,

12:17.760 --> 12:19.728
I was just after a couple of quid,

12:19.920 --> 12:23.129
but I got a cursed coin
from ancient Babylon instead.

12:23.280 --> 12:26.170
Yeah, sure, that could happen to anyone.

12:26.320 --> 12:30.245
The Men of Letters decided
I showed promise, and signed me up.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.331
They gave me a life.

12:35.920 --> 12:36.921
They, uh...

12:41.760 --> 12:42.966
You all right?

12:44.600 --> 12:46.523
Yeah. Always.

12:47.680 --> 12:49.011
Got any vodka?

12:51.880 --> 12:53.370
Hello!

12:55.680 --> 12:59.321
You must be Kelly. And you're her partner?

12:59.480 --> 13:00.641
No.

13:00.840 --> 13:03.525
- Birth coach.
- Sure.

13:05.520 --> 13:08.046
Well, Kelly's vitals and preliminary labs
were great.

13:08.200 --> 13:10.680
So we're just gonna do a quick sonogram.

13:10.840 --> 13:13.491
- Is that really necessary?
- Of course it is.

13:15.640 --> 13:17.722
Want the baby to be a happy camper.

13:17.880 --> 13:18.927
Right over here.

13:20.640 --> 13:24.008
Okay, Kelly.
Just lift up there, please. Thank you.

13:24.160 --> 13:26.481
I'm gonna put a little bit of gel
on the camera,

13:26.640 --> 13:28.290
so it might be a little bit cold.

13:28.440 --> 13:31.569
Okay, say "cheese."

13:31.720 --> 13:32.881
Cheese.

13:36.800 --> 13:38.529
Okay. Huh?

13:41.960 --> 13:42.961
Huh.

13:43.400 --> 13:45.562
It's looking good.

13:46.240 --> 13:47.241
Hmm.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.001
Hmm.

13:53.440 --> 13:54.726
What?

13:54.880 --> 13:57.451
DAGON:
<i>Everything looks A-okay.</i>

13:57.600 --> 13:59.250
Everything looks A-okay!

14:01.440 --> 14:06.367
See, Kelly? Your baby is a little angel.
Just like I've been saying.

14:07.920 --> 14:11.129
Now, I know this can be
a little bit awkward,

14:11.280 --> 14:14.966
but for the little champ's medical record,
what can you tell me about his father?

14:21.400 --> 14:24.324
How the mighty have sunk, eh?

14:31.120 --> 14:32.360
Good puppy.

14:40.720 --> 14:42.210
Puppy want to play?

14:51.680 --> 14:52.886
What's the matter?

15:13.760 --> 15:14.921
What are you doing?

15:22.520 --> 15:25.649
I'm giving you what you want. Submission.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.285
- Why?
- Why not?

15:29.440 --> 15:32.011
I figured out the rules of the house.

15:32.200 --> 15:36.569
And, well, all things considered,
I think I'd rather be here

15:36.720 --> 15:39.246
than rotting in the Cage with my drooling,

15:39.400 --> 15:42.210
insane-and-not-in-the-fun way
little bro, Michael.

15:43.240 --> 15:44.321
Really?

15:46.360 --> 15:49.284
Yes, it's your game,

15:50.880 --> 15:52.484
your rules, so, uh...

15:54.680 --> 15:56.330
I figure I can work with that.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.366
You win.

16:04.640 --> 16:07.962
What now, sire?

16:12.040 --> 16:13.849
- Ketch.
- MR. KETCH: <i>A quick update.</i>

16:14.000 --> 16:16.890
The skels turned out to be shape-shifters.
Killed a clan of seven.

16:17.080 --> 16:18.241
Eight.

16:18.680 --> 16:20.808
Eight, she says.

16:21.720 --> 16:23.131
I've learned not to argue.

16:23.840 --> 16:26.446
Um, you'll make
with the type-y type-y, yes?

16:26.600 --> 16:29.604
- I'll file the report.
- Splendid. Ciao.

16:32.240 --> 16:35.847
So, you and Mick, long-time friends?

16:36.840 --> 16:41.926
More survivors than friends.
We were in school together.

16:42.240 --> 16:45.005
Ah. Major in murder, minor in mayhem?

16:45.200 --> 16:47.248
Mmm.

16:47.920 --> 16:52.084
I gather your training
was a bit more improvisational?

16:54.760 --> 16:56.046
We learned on the job.

16:58.920 --> 17:02.288
And then you gave it all up.

17:05.119 --> 17:07.599
I wanted a quiet, normal life.

17:09.720 --> 17:14.851
Mmm. And yet, there you were
up to your elbows in shifter guts.

17:15.079 --> 17:17.481
Mrs. Winchester,

17:19.440 --> 17:21.807
I believe you're drawn to danger.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.527
Cheers.

17:47.080 --> 17:48.491
Sorry to interrupt.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.604
There's really no need
for that, Mr. Davies.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.768
We know each other?

17:54.920 --> 17:57.287
I'm Renny. Rawlings.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.650
I've been working directly for Dr. Hess

17:59.800 --> 18:02.883
since I graduated Kendricks,
top of my class.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.523
Oh, cheers.

18:06.520 --> 18:07.851
What do you want?

18:08.520 --> 18:10.966
Dr. Hess sent me on the overnight.

18:11.120 --> 18:12.849
Thought you could use
an extra set of hands.

18:13.880 --> 18:15.041
Oh...

18:15.520 --> 18:20.845
So put another way, you're her lapdog,
here to keep an eye on me.

18:22.520 --> 18:23.681
I'm here to help.

18:25.120 --> 18:26.531
You wanna help?

18:27.440 --> 18:28.771
Stay out of my way.

18:28.960 --> 18:31.008
I'm afraid that's not an option.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.809
Sorry, we're closed for the day.

18:51.960 --> 18:53.485
Those your patient files?

18:53.640 --> 18:55.688
My patient history is
none of your business.

19:03.720 --> 19:08.248
CASTIEL: <i>This is
my voicemail. Make your voice a mail.</i>

19:08.400 --> 19:10.846
Come on, Cass,
I've called you three times now.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.330
Will you call me back?

19:14.480 --> 19:17.689
We've got a line on Dagon.
We need your help.

19:17.880 --> 19:22.044
So, you ran the plates of every car
that drove past that warehouse in Idaho,

19:22.200 --> 19:23.531
just before it burned down?

19:23.720 --> 19:27.691
Yeah. Most of them were local,
but one wasn't.

19:27.840 --> 19:31.686
It came up registered to Dermott Culp.

19:31.840 --> 19:35.845
- So?
- So he went missing a year ago.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.527
- Okay.
- I tracked his car to Iowa.

19:40.680 --> 19:44.685
Found him coming out of a building,
carrying a dead body.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.725
So, Dermott's a killer?

19:51.960 --> 19:53.291
Dermott's a demon.

19:57.720 --> 19:59.051
Hunter.

19:59.800 --> 20:00.926
Demon.

20:04.160 --> 20:05.889
Uh, one of Crowley's?

20:06.040 --> 20:07.485
Works for Dagon.

20:07.680 --> 20:09.284
<i>He covers her tracks.</i>

20:16.560 --> 20:17.800
Smart.

20:17.960 --> 20:20.406
Dude, don't compliment the bad guys.

20:22.800 --> 20:25.246
So, do you know where Kelly is now?

20:25.400 --> 20:26.925
No.

20:27.120 --> 20:30.761
But before Dermott
got stabbed in the heart...

20:32.560 --> 20:33.721
Nice.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.962
He gave me her phone number.

20:45.320 --> 20:46.731
Yeah, nice.

20:51.240 --> 20:54.164
My loyal-ish subjects,

20:55.760 --> 20:57.649
these troubled times,

20:57.800 --> 21:01.009
I'm aware
that there might be some confusion

21:01.160 --> 21:04.004
as to where you're supposed to
place your loyalty.

21:04.200 --> 21:07.044
Even with Lucifer back in the Cage,

21:07.240 --> 21:10.130
there are those of you
who would try to help him

21:11.600 --> 21:15.969
because he scares you, or engorges you.

21:16.120 --> 21:20.682
Just the chance
that Lucifer could come back, a rumor,

21:20.880 --> 21:24.202
<i>would have been enough to keep
some of you working against me.</i>

21:24.360 --> 21:26.124
Undermining me.

21:26.280 --> 21:31.002
Being a royal pain in my pert, royal ass.

21:31.160 --> 21:34.881
But lo! The beast has been humbled.

21:38.880 --> 21:43.727
From his own lips you will hear proclaimed
the one true leader of all Hell.

21:45.320 --> 21:50.326
See, I didn't just beat the Devil,
I tamed him.

21:53.800 --> 21:56.246
This is all done
of your own free will, is it not?

21:58.520 --> 21:59.567
Yes, My Lord.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.411
Look, kids.

22:03.560 --> 22:07.167
He goes where I tell him.
He does what I tell him.

22:07.320 --> 22:09.561
He is my dog.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.684
Showtime, Marmaduke.

22:15.840 --> 22:17.080
Yes, My Lord.

22:22.880 --> 22:25.531
He's right, my friends.

22:26.760 --> 22:29.923
There is only one true ruler of Hell.

22:30.080 --> 22:31.241
Me.

22:31.400 --> 22:33.482
- And that is me, is it not?
- Oh, yes.

22:33.640 --> 22:37.087
CROWLEY: <i>And you surrender your heartfelt
support to that one true ruler?</i>

22:37.240 --> 22:38.480
Absolutely.

22:38.640 --> 22:39.971
CROWLEY: <i>And what do you have to say</i>

22:40.120 --> 22:44.842
to those who are still unsure
of whom they must obey?

22:45.800 --> 22:47.802
I say this.

22:47.960 --> 22:52.522
Anyone who does not support
this one true king

22:52.720 --> 22:58.841
can be assured of suffering unendurable,
and everlasting agony.

23:06.720 --> 23:08.131
I don't hear applause.

23:19.320 --> 23:23.644
Dr. Turner was very specific.
I need zinc and iron.

23:23.800 --> 23:26.406
- Yeah, got it.
- And this article says calcium.

23:26.560 --> 23:29.211
Cool. Bye.

23:37.320 --> 23:40.403
- SAM: <i>Ms. Kline?</i>
- Yes?

23:40.600 --> 23:45.083
<i>This is Oliver at Dr. Turner's office.
He'd like to see you in the office today.</i>

23:45.240 --> 23:48.289
I, uh, was just in there.
He said everything was fine.

23:48.440 --> 23:50.363
Uh, right. Well, he looked back
through your test results,

23:50.520 --> 23:52.409
and there are some things
he'd like to discuss.

23:52.560 --> 23:54.767
Does 5:00 p.m. work for you?

23:54.920 --> 23:56.922
I don't think I can get away.

23:57.120 --> 24:00.203
Well, he said it's very important.
5:00 p.m.?

24:00.360 --> 24:02.681
- Um, sure.
- Good, see you then.

24:03.680 --> 24:04.761
Cool.

24:19.360 --> 24:20.646
I thought you'd be coming alone.

24:20.800 --> 24:23.201
And I thought we'd gotten past
our trust issues.

24:23.360 --> 24:27.490
But, if Dagon shows,
we're gonna need all the help we can get.

24:27.640 --> 24:30.041
This is Renny Rawlings. New man.

24:31.320 --> 24:34.722
Right. I'm Sam. This is Eileen, Leahy.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.882
Ah, the banshee girl.

24:38.480 --> 24:39.891
We have a file.

24:40.080 --> 24:44.051
From what Mick tells me,
neither of you have any formal training.

24:44.200 --> 24:45.565
Fascinating.

24:45.720 --> 24:48.087
- I was top of my class at Kendricks.
- No one cares.

24:52.480 --> 24:55.006
I, uh, brought the Colt,
just like you asked.

24:57.080 --> 24:58.844
But it's gotta go back to HQ.

25:00.760 --> 25:03.570
Gee, Mick, I thought
we'd gotten past the trust issues.

25:21.440 --> 25:23.442
Stay cool and walk with me.

25:23.600 --> 25:24.726
Dean?

25:53.560 --> 25:54.800
This everyone?

25:54.960 --> 25:56.485
Yeah, still no word from Cass.

25:56.640 --> 25:58.563
Right, great.

25:59.320 --> 26:00.731
- Who's this?
- He's with Mick.

26:00.880 --> 26:02.928
I'm Renny Rawlings,
graduated Kendricks, top of my...

26:03.120 --> 26:04.360
Great, I don't care.

26:05.480 --> 26:07.562
- Come on. Okay.
- Don't!

26:13.400 --> 26:14.561
Kelly.

26:15.640 --> 26:21.761
Listen, we all know you're in a
really difficult situation and we just...

26:21.920 --> 26:23.251
We wanna help.

26:23.400 --> 26:25.323
You call this helping?

26:25.520 --> 26:28.888
Look, Kelly, that kid, it's...
I mean, it can't...

26:30.160 --> 26:32.527
- I mean, it's Lucifer's!
- Yeah, I know.

26:34.600 --> 26:36.602
What, you think I wanted this to happen?

26:39.840 --> 26:41.285
He used me.

26:44.760 --> 26:46.649
But I love this child.

26:48.600 --> 26:51.888
You will mean absolutely nothing
to that child.

26:53.840 --> 26:56.047
- That child will kill us all.
- Hey.

26:56.200 --> 26:58.567
SAM: <i>Look, that's not happening, okay?</i>

26:58.760 --> 27:00.728
We're gonna figure something out, we will.

27:00.880 --> 27:02.086
- This is absurd.
- Don't!

27:10.800 --> 27:11.881
She's here.

27:19.760 --> 27:20.841
DAGON: Hey.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.001
Oh...

28:47.120 --> 28:49.327
I didn't mean to!

28:50.280 --> 28:52.089
I was shooting at the demon!

28:53.240 --> 28:55.163
We know, we know. It was an accident.

28:56.920 --> 28:58.001
It's all right.

28:58.160 --> 29:01.050
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?
- Hey!

29:02.000 --> 29:05.209
She killed a Man of Letters,
she has to die.

29:05.360 --> 29:07.328
- It was an accident.
- It doesn't matter.

29:08.640 --> 29:10.642
- The Code...
- No, hey, screw the Code.

29:10.800 --> 29:13.167
Don't make this harder than it already is.

29:13.320 --> 29:15.004
Mick, you don't have to do this.

29:15.160 --> 29:16.844
Yes, I do!

29:17.000 --> 29:20.322
Please. Don't.

29:20.480 --> 29:22.608
Please. Please, don't.

29:22.760 --> 29:24.524
The Code demands otherwise.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.964
Please. Please!

29:31.320 --> 29:33.368
SAM: <i>Mick, Mick, listen to me.</i>

29:33.520 --> 29:34.851
<i>Mick.</i>

29:35.040 --> 29:40.080
I know you guys have this Men of Letters
Code you blindly answer to.

29:40.240 --> 29:42.641
But, look,
you don't have to do that, Mick.

29:43.880 --> 29:45.370
You're better than that.

29:47.680 --> 29:49.728
You only have to answer to yourself.

29:49.880 --> 29:51.723
You only have to do
what you know is right.

29:54.240 --> 29:56.720
You only have to answer to your own code.

30:10.480 --> 30:11.641
Just go.

30:13.440 --> 30:14.726
Yeah.

30:27.760 --> 30:30.001
Well, that was unexpected.

30:31.600 --> 30:33.409
But invigorating.

30:35.080 --> 30:37.765
I must say, when I first met you,
I didn't see this coming.

30:37.920 --> 30:40.605
My thought at the time was,

30:40.760 --> 30:43.081
"I'll end up shooting this one."

30:50.840 --> 30:53.241
Life is full of surprises.

30:57.280 --> 30:59.442
- Ketch?
- Yes?

30:59.600 --> 31:02.649
You're not reading anything into this?

31:02.800 --> 31:04.086
Like?

31:04.240 --> 31:08.165
Like, it means anything.

31:10.800 --> 31:12.484
On...

31:13.360 --> 31:16.443
You really needn't worry.

31:16.640 --> 31:20.611
Truth is I'm not built for that.

31:20.760 --> 31:23.001
And I suspect you aren't either?

31:25.720 --> 31:27.051
You're wrong.

31:28.240 --> 31:30.322
But that was a long time ago.

31:34.240 --> 31:35.401
So we're good?

31:37.160 --> 31:38.366
We are.

31:39.320 --> 31:43.291
And I notice you took my advice.

31:43.440 --> 31:44.851
Advice?

31:45.000 --> 31:49.130
You had a choice to make.
Your work or family ties.

31:51.920 --> 31:53.251
You know what?

31:54.760 --> 31:56.569
It's not either-or.

31:56.720 --> 32:02.090
I had the same discussion with my boys.
I'm not choosing hunting over them.

32:02.240 --> 32:03.924
Why does it have to be one or the other?

32:05.120 --> 32:09.011
- So you want to have it all?
- Trying to.

32:11.440 --> 32:12.601
Good for you.

32:19.840 --> 32:22.127
So, how we looking?

32:22.280 --> 32:24.044
Uh, you're sure
Crowley's occupied elsewhere?

32:24.200 --> 32:26.771
Yeah, he's on his rounds.

32:26.960 --> 32:28.724
Crowley's got, like,
two and a half more hours

32:28.920 --> 32:31.400
of getting his pert, royal ass kissed.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.884
Well, upper left quadrant is sound.

32:38.040 --> 32:41.044
Restorations holding.
No emanations detected.

32:43.360 --> 32:45.089
Lower left, likewise.

32:45.240 --> 32:46.969
You made the right decision, you know.

32:48.120 --> 32:50.566
'Cause when the dust settles,
there's only gonna be one of us standing,

32:50.720 --> 32:53.690
and it ain't gonna be the guy with
the accent, if you know what I mean.

32:55.760 --> 32:57.922
I'm very, very impressed.

33:00.920 --> 33:06.324
You'll be happy to know,
the vessel is completely sound.

33:06.480 --> 33:09.086
The repairs are secure.

33:09.240 --> 33:10.924
And the security system?

33:11.080 --> 33:14.721
Whatever it is that lets Crowley turn me
into his own personal sock puppet?

33:18.840 --> 33:20.808
I don't hear words.

33:20.960 --> 33:24.931
Uh, the system is very much intact.

33:26.920 --> 33:28.410
But you can disarm it.

33:32.760 --> 33:35.001
I'm not really known for my patience.

33:36.400 --> 33:38.323
- I don't quite have the means at this...
- Who does?

33:38.480 --> 33:41.689
- Uh, Spivak. He designed...
- Where is he?

33:41.840 --> 33:43.205
Dead.

33:43.360 --> 33:45.840
- Dead?
- Dead.

33:50.040 --> 33:52.691
Uh, yeah, after the system was installed,

33:52.880 --> 33:55.884
Crowley killed Spivak
to safeguard its secrets.

33:56.080 --> 33:57.366
Hmm.

33:57.960 --> 33:59.086
Well...

34:01.880 --> 34:04.121
You can crack it, right?

34:04.280 --> 34:06.931
Yeah, I just need some time.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.847
- I'll be quick.
- Good.

34:12.320 --> 34:14.607
'Cause I am getting stir crazy.

34:15.719 --> 34:17.643
And I'm about to be a dad.

34:19.320 --> 34:20.810
Uh...

34:42.159 --> 34:43.241
You okay?

34:46.120 --> 34:47.167
No.

34:49.320 --> 34:51.766
He wasn't a monster.

34:51.920 --> 34:54.491
He was... I...

34:57.280 --> 34:58.361
Hey.

35:00.640 --> 35:01.971
It was a mistake.

35:22.360 --> 35:25.569
- Why are you doing this?
- Oh, don't even.

35:25.720 --> 35:28.200
I tried, but clearly,
you can't be trusted.

35:29.520 --> 35:32.683
I was worried about the baby.
I'm trying to protect him.

35:32.840 --> 35:35.366
Oh, honey, you can't.

35:35.520 --> 35:39.127
I mean, you don't need to. I wasn't lying.

35:40.120 --> 35:42.646
Your baby is strong, so strong.

35:42.800 --> 35:46.964
Whatever happens,
he is going to be just fine.

35:49.440 --> 35:53.161
But you won't.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.846
Yeah, those weird little pains?

35:58.760 --> 36:00.603
Just a taste of what's to come.

36:00.800 --> 36:04.122
'Cause, kiddo, birthing a Nephilim...

36:07.160 --> 36:08.321
Fatal.

36:09.400 --> 36:10.606
Always.

36:35.400 --> 36:36.561
Ketch.

36:37.960 --> 36:40.042
Why'd you call me here?

36:40.200 --> 36:41.611
Oh, I didn't.

36:50.200 --> 36:51.440
Mr. Davies.

36:52.800 --> 36:55.963
Dr. Hess. I didn't think you left London.

36:56.120 --> 36:57.645
I don't.

36:59.200 --> 37:02.966
But I have been tasked by the other elders

37:03.120 --> 37:07.921
to fix this rapidly
deteriorating situation.

37:08.120 --> 37:09.281
Ma'am, please, I'm...

37:09.440 --> 37:15.322
Are you about to tell me
that you are doing the best that you can?

37:18.920 --> 37:22.367
Two days ago,
according to your own report,

37:22.520 --> 37:28.801
you let a Prince of Hell escape,
and the mother of Lucifer's child,

37:28.960 --> 37:32.521
and one of my best men was murdered
by an American hunter,

37:32.680 --> 37:34.842
- whom you allowed to live.
- If I might...

37:35.000 --> 37:40.848
These hunters are out of control,
the brothers Winchester in particular,

37:41.000 --> 37:43.401
which Lady Bevell
has exhaustively documented.

37:43.560 --> 37:47.565
- Ma'am, if you would just listen...
- To what? More excuses?

37:50.440 --> 37:53.046
No. I don't think I Will.

37:56.440 --> 37:59.887
Hunters are dogs, Mr. Davies.

38:01.600 --> 38:04.649
You give them an order and they obey.

38:05.800 --> 38:07.529
That's how it works.

38:08.400 --> 38:10.050
So tell me, do they?

38:11.160 --> 38:12.400
Do they obey you?

38:16.480 --> 38:19.643
No. Of course not.

38:22.800 --> 38:28.603
So, this Eileen Leahy
will be found, and killed,

38:28.760 --> 38:30.842
in accordance with the Code.

38:32.160 --> 38:34.401
As for the Winchesters,
like any rebellious hunter,

38:34.560 --> 38:38.963
they will be investigated and,
if found guilty, executed.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.081
"If"?

38:41.760 --> 38:44.001
If they're found guilty?

38:44.160 --> 38:46.162
Aren't hunters always found guilty?

38:46.320 --> 38:49.324
- Be careful, Mr. Davies.
- No.

38:53.000 --> 38:57.005
My entire life with the Men of Letters,
I never broke a rule.

38:58.320 --> 39:02.928
And, yes, at first, I was shocked
at how Sam and Dean operate.

39:03.080 --> 39:05.003
But what Lady Bevell doesn't mention

39:05.160 --> 39:09.006
is the lives they've saved,
monsters destroyed,

39:09.200 --> 39:11.726
and outcomes made better
not because of the Code,

39:11.880 --> 39:15.043
but because of Sam and Dean Winchester's
sense of what's right.

39:15.200 --> 39:16.770
And that is the crux of the matter.

39:18.200 --> 39:22.171
The Code is not a suggestion,
it is an absolute.

39:22.320 --> 39:24.971
The Code is what separates us
from the monsters.

39:25.120 --> 39:27.282
It is the order by which we all live.

39:28.920 --> 39:29.967
No.

39:34.280 --> 39:37.284
The Code is what makes
a young boy kill his best friend.

39:39.240 --> 39:41.208
When I was a child, I had nothing.

39:42.480 --> 39:45.484
I owed you everything. And I obeyed.

39:47.400 --> 39:49.528
But I'm a man now, Dr. Hess.

39:49.680 --> 39:51.682
<i>And I can see the choices.</i>

39:52.720 --> 39:55.564
And I choose to do the right thing!

40:08.680 --> 40:09.841
Morning.

40:12.240 --> 40:13.401
Morning.

40:15.480 --> 40:18.643
Hey, you, uh, hear anything from Cass yet?

40:19.160 --> 40:21.731
No, he's still MIA.

40:22.840 --> 40:23.921
You think he's all right?

40:25.920 --> 40:27.160
I don't know.

40:29.840 --> 40:31.649
Where's Eileen?

40:31.800 --> 40:33.086
She took off.

40:33.280 --> 40:35.203
Uh, said she's heading back to Ireland
for a while.

40:35.360 --> 40:36.850
Just needs some time, I guess.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.001
Hmm.

40:38.600 --> 40:39.681
Yeah, I get that.

40:41.440 --> 40:42.646
Mmm.

40:55.320 --> 40:56.401
Oh, yeah.

40:59.720 --> 41:01.245
Welcome back, sweetheart.

41:14.480 --> 41:16.084
It's over.

41:16.280 --> 41:21.081
The grand experiment
of recruiting American hunters has failed.

41:21.240 --> 41:22.480
Utterly.

41:23.640 --> 41:24.880
Hmm.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.411
What would you like me to do?

41:28.400 --> 41:29.925
Exterminate them.

41:31.720 --> 41:34.371
Every last one.
