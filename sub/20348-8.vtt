WEBVTT

01:34.429 --> 01:35.513
<i>Okay.</i>

01:35.972 --> 01:37.140
<i>Begin.</i>

01:38.600 --> 01:41.019
<i>My name is Nora Elizabeth Jamison Durst.</i>

01:41.186 --> 01:43.813
<i>Date of birth, 11-18-1979.</i>

01:44.272 --> 01:46.441
This is a copy of today's paper.

01:49.569 --> 01:53.323
I hereby indemnify all individuals
for the procedure that's about to occur.

01:53.490 --> 01:56.534
I'm of sound mind and body,
and I'm acting of my own free will.

02:00.663 --> 02:01.873
That's it.

02:07.086 --> 02:08.421
Something wrong?

02:09.297 --> 02:11.341
<i>Nothing, it, uh... It's fine.</i>

02:12.050 --> 02:13.384
What did she say?

02:14.052 --> 02:16.221
<i>She wants you to do it again.</i>

02:16.554 --> 02:18.306
Why do you want me to do it again?

02:20.183 --> 02:23.978
<i>Because I do not believe you.</i>

02:24.229 --> 02:25.563
Excuse me?

02:26.397 --> 02:29.692
<i>Excuse me, but you're lying.</i>

02:31.903 --> 02:33.196
<i>You're just...</i>

02:33.988 --> 02:36.741
<i>You're just saying
what we want to hear.</i>

02:38.076 --> 02:41.913
You invited me here,
and then you rejected me.

02:43.248 --> 02:45.041
But I sat outside your house all night,

02:45.208 --> 02:47.043
and I followed you here
so you'd have no choice

02:47.210 --> 02:49.587
but to let me get into your machine.

02:49.754 --> 02:51.756
So, I don't give a shit
what you want to hear.

02:54.384 --> 02:55.969
And I don't lie.

02:58.388 --> 03:00.098
<i>Can you say
your children's names?</i>

03:00.265 --> 03:01.808
- What?
<i>- Your children.</i>

03:02.392 --> 03:03.935
<i>Do you think you can say their names?</i>

03:04.102 --> 03:05.436
Erin and Jeremy.

03:05.937 --> 03:07.564
<i>I meant in your statement.</i>

03:09.941 --> 03:11.568
<i>Would you like to try again?</i>

03:13.152 --> 03:14.279
Okay.

03:23.121 --> 03:26.416
My name is Nora Elizabeth Jamison Durst.

03:27.458 --> 03:30.795
I was born on November 18th, 1979.

03:34.424 --> 03:36.467
This is a copy of today's paper.

03:36.968 --> 03:40.013
Because today is the day
I'm leaving to be with them.

03:43.474 --> 03:45.518
I'm leaving to be with my children,

03:46.769 --> 03:48.980
Erin and Jeremy.

03:53.109 --> 03:54.652
I'm ready to go now.

04:01.034 --> 04:03.661
We, uh, prefer to give a more
thorough orientation,

04:03.828 --> 04:09.500
but since we were in the process of moving
on, you'll just have to bear with us.

04:18.509 --> 04:19.719
Was that a person?

04:19.928 --> 04:21.679
It's a fossil.

04:21.888 --> 04:23.640
The person is gone.

04:26.517 --> 04:28.311
Maybe they'll let you keep mine.

04:41.324 --> 04:43.409
As soon as we've administered
your saline drip,

04:43.576 --> 04:45.912
you disrobe outside the truck.

04:46.162 --> 04:49.248
Once you are inside, you will see
the event chamber at the far end.

04:49.415 --> 04:51.209
You just walk to it.

04:53.962 --> 04:56.130
You may experience nausea or discomfort

04:56.297 --> 04:59.717
as you pass by the undulating
laser array while it cycles up.

05:00.051 --> 05:01.970
Do not touch the array.

05:02.887 --> 05:04.347
Step inside the event chamber,

05:04.514 --> 05:06.015
close the exit port behind you,

05:06.182 --> 05:09.519
and turn the latch to the left,
hard to the left, it'll stick.

05:10.103 --> 05:13.648
Then pull your knees towards your chest
and hold them there.

05:15.858 --> 05:16.859
Okay?

05:17.068 --> 05:18.152
Okay.

05:18.319 --> 05:21.072
We will be monitoring you
from inside there.

05:21.698 --> 05:22.991
Once inside the event chamber,

05:23.157 --> 05:25.952
you will be able to hear us
and we will be able to hear you.

05:26.577 --> 05:29.580
When you're ready,
we will start the ignition sequence.

05:30.123 --> 05:32.166
You will hear three tones.

05:32.625 --> 05:36.421
After the third tone,
the chamber will fill up with fluid.

05:36.796 --> 05:40.967
The fluid will have the same consistency
as water, but it is not water.

05:41.592 --> 05:44.971
It contains metals
that will be irradiated.

05:46.806 --> 05:49.934
Once this occurs, the fluid will solidify.

05:51.644 --> 05:54.147
Do not ingest or breathe in
any of the fluid

05:54.313 --> 05:56.983
as your lungs would also
solidify upon transport.

06:00.945 --> 06:03.322
Can you hold your breath for 30 seconds?

06:04.949 --> 06:06.034
Yes.

06:07.910 --> 06:09.120
Well...

06:10.288 --> 06:11.622
Then that's it.

06:20.506 --> 06:21.716
<i>Activity.</i>

06:21.883 --> 06:23.342
Pole dancing.

06:25.511 --> 06:26.804
Um, noun.

06:27.055 --> 06:28.222
<i>Gecko.</i>

06:29.307 --> 06:31.309
"Gecko." Excellent.

06:33.811 --> 06:34.896
Uh, okay, last one.

06:35.063 --> 06:36.439
Man's name.

06:37.106 --> 06:38.316
Antonio.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.277
"Antonio." Perfect.

06:41.944 --> 06:43.488
Okay, here we go.

06:43.654 --> 06:47.909
"Nora Elizabeth Jamison Durst, age 417..."

06:48.076 --> 06:49.660
"Was vaporized by a consortium

06:49.827 --> 06:53.706
"of international physicists last Tuesday
outside Never Never Land.

06:54.207 --> 06:55.541
"Miss Durst was born and raised

06:55.708 --> 06:56.793
- "in Cairo, Egypt..."
- Mmm.

06:56.959 --> 07:00.671
"Where she returned after college
to squeeze a family,

07:01.214 --> 07:05.802
"her spiffy husband, Doug Durst,
and her beloved geese, Jeremy and Erin.

07:06.010 --> 07:07.553
<i>"Admired by her coworkers,</i>

07:07.720 --> 07:09.347
"she was a longtime employee

07:09.514 --> 07:11.766
"at the Department
of the Sudden Diarrhea."

07:11.933 --> 07:13.184
That's disgusting.

07:13.893 --> 07:16.938
"In her spare time,
Miss Durst enjoyed crosswords,

07:17.105 --> 07:19.232
"exposing frauds, and pole dancing.

07:20.650 --> 07:25.780
"She is survived, at least temporarily, by
her terminally ill gecko, Matthew Jamison.

07:33.663 --> 07:38.376
"As she lives on in our memories,
and in the Great Antonio in the sky.

07:41.003 --> 07:44.048
"There will be no funeral
or memorial service."

07:47.135 --> 07:48.886
Oh, God bless Matt Libs.

07:49.887 --> 07:52.056
I couldn't ask for a better obituary.

07:54.350 --> 07:55.935
Happy to oblige.

08:00.106 --> 08:03.734
You sending me those things is what got me
through Hellfire and Damnation.

08:04.902 --> 08:06.654
The horrible Bible camp
that Grandma and Pop-Pop

08:06.821 --> 08:09.115
used to send me off to
in the Adirondacks?

08:09.282 --> 08:13.244
It wasn't Hellfire and Damnation,
it was Camp Holy Spirit.

08:13.911 --> 08:16.289
Potato, potahto.

08:17.039 --> 08:19.167
<i>You were so young with the pigtails.</i>

08:19.959 --> 08:21.252
<i>What were you, eight years old?</i>

08:21.419 --> 08:22.587
Seven.

08:23.045 --> 08:25.298
Do you remember what you said to me
when you put me on the bus?

08:26.507 --> 08:27.675
"Brush your teeth"?

08:28.759 --> 08:30.136
You said...

08:32.471 --> 08:35.141
You said that I was
the bravest girl on Earth.

08:37.810 --> 08:41.230
And every time you sent
me a letter with a new Matt Lib in it,

08:42.440 --> 08:45.234
that's who it was addressed to,
the bravest girl on Earth.

08:46.736 --> 08:48.279
I forgot about that.

08:51.490 --> 08:53.075
You drive me fucking nuts.

08:55.077 --> 08:57.079
But you've always been
a great gecko, Matt.

08:59.832 --> 09:03.127
If I was a great gecko,
I'd be trying to talk you out of this.

09:03.628 --> 09:05.796
You're great because you're not trying.

09:10.593 --> 09:11.677
I'm scared.

09:12.303 --> 09:13.554
I'll be fine.

09:17.642 --> 09:19.602
Of course you will. You always are.

09:21.646 --> 09:24.982
I'm scared of what'll happen
when I go back to Mary.

09:27.485 --> 09:29.779
I'm scared of the chemicals
they're going to put in my body

09:29.946 --> 09:31.697
to try and make me better, and...

09:32.490 --> 09:34.242
I'm scared it won't work.

09:36.744 --> 09:38.788
I'm scared of dying, Nora.

09:43.501 --> 09:46.003
I'm scared my son will grow up without me.

09:46.963 --> 09:49.840
Forget my face.

09:51.676 --> 09:53.594
Forget the sound of my voice.

09:57.640 --> 10:00.268
But most of all,
I'm scared that I'll survive.

10:01.811 --> 10:03.479
Because if I do...

10:06.023 --> 10:09.235
How can I ever stand in front of a room
full of people and convince them

10:09.402 --> 10:13.572
that I have the answers when I have
no idea what the fuck I'm talking about?

10:16.867 --> 10:18.744
Do you want to come with me instead?

10:22.957 --> 10:26.961
I think, dear sister,
that defeats the purpose.

10:32.049 --> 10:35.261
What are you going to tell
people about me?

10:35.928 --> 10:37.430
About what happened here?

10:40.891 --> 10:42.893
Whatever you want me to.

10:52.486 --> 10:53.612
Are you ready?

10:57.408 --> 10:58.743
Of course she's ready.

10:59.952 --> 11:01.871
She's the bravest girl on Earth.

12:11.857 --> 12:13.317
<i>Give her the blanket.</i>

12:19.657 --> 12:20.658
<i>I'm hungry, Mom.</i>

12:20.825 --> 12:22.201
<i>I'm hungry!</i>

12:22.493 --> 12:23.994
<i>I'm hungry too.</i>

12:24.328 --> 12:25.496
<i>No phones at the table.</i>

12:25.663 --> 12:26.664
<i>Yours is out too.</i>

12:26.831 --> 12:27.998
<i>I'm waiting to hear about the job.</i>

12:28.165 --> 12:29.834
<i>- I want food!
- This is important too.</i>

12:30.167 --> 12:32.002
<i>I want food!</i>

12:32.461 --> 12:33.504
I want food!

12:33.838 --> 12:34.839
<i>It's coming, buddy.</i>

12:35.005 --> 12:36.006
<i>I want food!</i>

12:36.173 --> 12:37.675
<i>- Jeremy.
- I want food!</i>

12:37.842 --> 12:38.843
<i>Hey.</i>

12:39.009 --> 12:40.636
<i>- I want food!
- Cut it out.</i>

12:54.733 --> 12:57.069
God damn it, I said two hands!

13:37.193 --> 13:38.736
<i>Nora, can you hear me?</i>

13:40.446 --> 13:41.530
Yes.

13:41.947 --> 13:43.866
<i>Your brother is here with us.</i>

13:46.535 --> 13:47.912
<i>Hello, Nora.</i>

13:49.205 --> 13:50.414
Hi, Matt.

13:51.415 --> 13:52.750
<i>I love you.</i>

13:53.918 --> 13:55.252
I love you, too.

13:56.295 --> 13:58.130
<i>We're going to begin, Nora.</i>

14:52.977 --> 14:53.978
Yes!

16:50.594 --> 16:52.262
I was worried you'd forgotten.

17:03.107 --> 17:05.484
Don't usually get so many
so close together.

17:07.403 --> 17:09.113
Love is in the air.

17:16.453 --> 17:17.454
Um...

17:17.621 --> 17:19.998
A little extra for your trouble.

17:23.919 --> 17:27.339
Sarah, does the name "Kevin"
mean anything to you?

17:34.054 --> 17:35.097
No.

17:38.016 --> 17:39.476
Are you sure?

17:40.060 --> 17:43.105
Because a man calling himself
that came by yesterday.

17:43.564 --> 17:44.815
He had a photo.

17:45.983 --> 17:47.317
A photo of you.

17:49.570 --> 17:50.821
Did you tell him anything?

17:51.113 --> 17:52.322
No, of course not.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.785
But I think he knew I was lying.

19:49.731 --> 19:50.816
Nora?

19:57.990 --> 19:59.157
Uh, Kevin.

20:00.492 --> 20:01.952
Kevin Garvey.

20:02.119 --> 20:04.037
I don't know if you remember me.

20:04.621 --> 20:06.790
Um, I was the chief of police in Mapleton.

20:09.293 --> 20:11.587
We don't know each other really well.

20:11.753 --> 20:13.797
We only talked a couple times, really.

20:16.008 --> 20:20.888
There was this dance,
a Christmas dance at the high school.

20:22.723 --> 20:25.434
We just had a really nice conversation.

20:26.393 --> 20:27.477
Yeah.

20:27.978 --> 20:29.313
In the hallway.

20:32.357 --> 20:34.651
I don't expect you to remember.
It was a long time ago.

20:37.654 --> 20:39.406
What... What are you doing?

20:41.992 --> 20:46.538
Well, um, I've been kind of
wandering around Australia on vacation.

20:48.916 --> 20:50.000
Um, I...

20:50.167 --> 20:51.877
Just kind of getting off the grid.

20:52.044 --> 20:54.296
You know, trying to avoid
the touristy stuff.

20:55.464 --> 20:57.758
Like to get a little lost, you know?

20:59.676 --> 21:04.681
Anyway, I was, um, in that little town
down the road,

21:04.848 --> 21:06.475
and I saw you riding your bike.

21:06.642 --> 21:08.894
And I thought to myself, "Holy shit.

21:09.061 --> 21:12.856
"I think that's Nora Durst."
And, so, I found out where you lived.

21:15.108 --> 21:16.485
And here you are.

21:19.780 --> 21:21.531
That's not what happened.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.408
Sorry?

21:23.825 --> 21:26.870
You showed a picture of me
to the nun at the convent.

21:27.037 --> 21:29.164
That's how you found out where I lived.

21:31.625 --> 21:32.834
Why would I have a picture of you?

21:33.001 --> 21:34.169
I just came from there.

21:34.336 --> 21:36.672
- She told me that you asked if I...
- Are you married?

21:36.880 --> 21:37.881
What?

21:38.048 --> 21:40.676
Are you married
or are you seeing somebody?

21:42.469 --> 21:45.222
I... I noticed you weren't wearing
a wedding ring.

21:46.932 --> 21:52.062
Uh, and I saw that they were
having a dance in town tonight.

21:53.063 --> 21:57.693
And, uh, when I saw you riding your bike,
it reminded me...

21:59.319 --> 22:01.571
How I'd always wished I had asked you

22:02.990 --> 22:04.116
to dance.

22:08.120 --> 22:12.416
Anyway, I know it sounds crazy,
but I... I felt a connection.

22:13.917 --> 22:17.212
So, here we are in the middle of nowhere
bumping into each other,

22:17.379 --> 22:22.592
and I'm only here for the night,
and I figured, uh, you know,

22:23.176 --> 22:25.512
if I didn't ask you to dance tonight...

22:30.851 --> 22:32.602
I'll never forgive myself.

22:35.939 --> 22:37.566
You need to leave now.

22:40.318 --> 22:41.445
Okay.

22:42.696 --> 22:43.947
I get it.

22:45.282 --> 22:48.243
A guy you barely remember shows up
on your doorstep, asks you to

22:48.952 --> 22:50.454
go on a date with him...

22:51.455 --> 22:52.581
Yeah.

22:52.956 --> 22:54.291
I had to try.

22:56.501 --> 22:58.045
Please just go.

22:59.588 --> 23:01.298
I'll be there if you change your mind.

23:01.465 --> 23:04.760
They're shutting down all of Main Street,
so you're not gonna be able to miss it.

23:12.976 --> 23:15.062
It's good to see you, Nora.

24:36.393 --> 24:38.228
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Did you tell him?

24:38.436 --> 24:39.437
<i>Nora?</i>

24:39.604 --> 24:41.064
Did you tell him?

24:41.565 --> 24:43.316
<i>I... I don't understand
what you're asking me.</i>

24:43.483 --> 24:45.861
Kevin, fucking Kevin. He's here.

24:46.319 --> 24:47.445
He found me.

24:47.612 --> 24:50.240
<i>What? He's... He's there in Australia?</i>

24:50.407 --> 24:53.326
Did you tell him where I was, Laurie?

24:54.161 --> 24:55.203
No.

24:55.370 --> 24:56.580
No, I didn't.

24:56.746 --> 24:59.875
- Because if you did, just say so, and I...
<i>- I didn't.</i>

25:01.001 --> 25:03.128
We established boundaries
the first time you called me.

25:03.295 --> 25:04.337
Clear boundaries.

25:04.504 --> 25:05.547
I don't tell you about the people here,

25:05.714 --> 25:07.799
and I don't tell the people
here about you.

25:07.966 --> 25:09.759
I would never betray that, Nora.

25:11.845 --> 25:13.430
Then how did he find me?

25:14.139 --> 25:15.765
<i>How did he say he found you?</i>

25:16.183 --> 25:19.895
He said that he was here on vacation,
and he spotted me.

25:20.437 --> 25:23.857
And then he came to my house, and he
knocked on my door, and he acted like

25:24.024 --> 25:27.110
we were just casual acquaintances
from Mapleton years back,

25:27.277 --> 25:29.779
like... Like...
Like we were never together.

25:29.946 --> 25:32.949
Like... Like none of it happened.

25:34.034 --> 25:35.035
Huh.

25:35.535 --> 25:37.162
"Huh"? What's that mean, "huh"?

25:37.329 --> 25:39.122
Well, I'm just surprised, that's all.

25:39.289 --> 25:41.833
It's a very un-Kevin-like thing to do.

25:42.792 --> 25:44.169
Is he crazy?

25:44.669 --> 25:45.879
<i>Does he seem crazy?</i>

25:46.296 --> 25:47.297
No.

25:47.464 --> 25:49.049
He seemed happy.

25:49.966 --> 25:50.967
Huh.

25:51.134 --> 25:52.802
Would you please stop fucking saying that?

25:52.969 --> 25:54.054
<i>Okay.</i>

25:54.596 --> 25:56.181
Why... Why is he doing this?

25:56.348 --> 25:57.599
I don't know.

25:58.475 --> 25:59.726
Did he say anything else?

26:01.853 --> 26:03.813
He asked me to a dance.

26:04.522 --> 26:05.523
<i>Uh, a dance?</i>

26:05.690 --> 26:09.152
I guess there's a dance in town tonight,
and he asked me to go.

26:09.945 --> 26:11.154
And you don't want to?

26:11.321 --> 26:12.364
No.

26:12.822 --> 26:13.823
<i>What do you want?</i>

26:13.990 --> 26:15.659
I want him to leave me alone.

26:16.243 --> 26:17.744
Then why are you calling me?

26:17.911 --> 26:18.912
<i>What?</i>

26:19.079 --> 26:20.664
Well, I can't make him leave you alone.

26:20.830 --> 26:23.917
I'm half a world away,
so why did you call me?

26:24.125 --> 26:26.878
I called you because
I thought you told him where I was.

26:27.337 --> 26:30.131
Come on, you know I didn't tell him that.

26:31.675 --> 26:36.096
You called me because you wanted me
to say it's okay to go to the dance.

26:36.263 --> 26:39.516
I do not want to go to the fucking dance!

26:40.267 --> 26:41.476
Gotcha.

26:43.019 --> 26:44.479
But if you did, it's okay.

26:44.688 --> 26:47.190
Jesus Christ, Laurie.

26:47.899 --> 26:49.359
Same time next week?

31:06.241 --> 31:07.325
Where're your beads?

31:07.492 --> 31:09.786
- Excuse me?
- Your beads. You need beads.

31:09.953 --> 31:11.746
- Here, take one of mine.
- No, thank you.

32:08.553 --> 32:09.679
You came.

32:10.638 --> 32:12.015
It's a wedding.

32:12.765 --> 32:13.808
I know.

32:14.350 --> 32:16.185
You told me it was a dance.

32:17.979 --> 32:19.439
People are dancing.

32:24.527 --> 32:25.612
Were you even invited?

32:25.778 --> 32:27.322
Yeah, of course I was.

32:30.199 --> 32:31.451
Um...

32:32.118 --> 32:33.870
That's... That's Eddie.

32:34.370 --> 32:37.498
He can take a tractor apart
and put it back together blindfolded.

32:37.957 --> 32:39.334
Allegedly.

32:39.709 --> 32:42.670
And that's Aggie.

32:44.589 --> 32:45.840
She was in the army.

32:46.007 --> 32:47.634
She left, too many rules.

32:50.386 --> 32:52.555
I bumped into them at the hotel bar,
they told me if I didn't come,

32:52.722 --> 32:54.807
they'd be angry with me.

32:56.434 --> 32:58.561
How did you find me, Kevin?

33:00.521 --> 33:02.732
I'm on vacation in Australia.

33:03.566 --> 33:05.151
I saw you ride by on your bike.

33:05.318 --> 33:06.569
This is the middle of nowhere.

33:06.736 --> 33:08.363
Why would you come here on vacation?

33:08.529 --> 33:11.741
My father came Down Under a while back

33:11.991 --> 33:16.579
and, uh, told me it was an amazing place,
so I just wanted to see for myself.

33:16.913 --> 33:18.748
So you're saying
you've never been here before?

33:18.915 --> 33:20.416
This is your first time in Australia?

33:20.750 --> 33:21.751
Uh-huh.

33:23.002 --> 33:25.046
You're really gonna keep this up?

33:26.589 --> 33:28.091
Keep what up?

33:30.760 --> 33:35.598
So, you and me, we only talked that one
time at that Christmas dance in Mapleton?

33:35.765 --> 33:36.891
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

33:37.600 --> 33:38.685
What about the courthouse?

33:41.896 --> 33:43.356
We got our divorces on the same day

33:43.523 --> 33:44.774
and ran into each other.

33:44.941 --> 33:46.192
I asked you to go to Miami.

33:46.359 --> 33:47.652
You asked me to go to Miami?

33:47.819 --> 33:48.903
Yes.

33:50.363 --> 33:51.948
But we were strangers?

33:52.573 --> 33:53.616
Yes.

33:55.451 --> 33:57.578
And you're giving me a hard time
about inviting you to a dance?

33:57.745 --> 33:59.080
It's a wedding.

34:01.874 --> 34:03.876
You must have me confused
with someone else.

34:06.087 --> 34:09.882
Because if you asked me to go to Miami
with you, I definitely would've gone.

34:11.843 --> 34:13.136
I love Miami.

34:17.807 --> 34:21.310
So... So, you never left?

34:23.396 --> 34:26.190
You've been a cop in Mapleton
all this time?

34:26.524 --> 34:27.525
Uh-huh.

34:28.985 --> 34:32.238
Then you knew my brother, Matt Jamison.

34:35.825 --> 34:38.244
I was hoping you were gonna
come to the funeral.

34:41.372 --> 34:43.332
We said our goodbyes in person.

34:45.001 --> 34:46.878
It was a beautiful service.

34:48.337 --> 34:50.131
Over 400 people came.

34:52.091 --> 34:53.885
Mary gave the eulogy.

34:57.180 --> 34:58.723
She really loved him.

35:00.516 --> 35:02.018
There was a lot to love.

35:08.274 --> 35:10.151
How are Jill and Tom?

35:12.820 --> 35:14.739
You remember my kids' names?

35:15.573 --> 35:16.699
Yeah.

35:18.034 --> 35:19.160
I remember.

35:21.788 --> 35:24.207
It's a little creepy, but I am impressed.

35:29.045 --> 35:30.963
Jill's great.

35:31.130 --> 35:32.673
She married a great guy.

35:33.591 --> 35:35.551
They, uh, have a daughter together.

35:35.718 --> 35:36.719
Penelope.

35:36.886 --> 35:38.721
About a year old now.

35:39.722 --> 35:42.517
And I'm a fucking grandpa.

35:44.268 --> 35:46.395
Tommy's marriage didn't work out so great.

35:47.230 --> 35:50.066
But he landed on his feet,
like he always does.

35:52.360 --> 35:53.444
What about you?

35:53.903 --> 35:54.946
Me?

35:55.446 --> 35:56.989
Did you ever get married again?

35:57.782 --> 35:58.825
No.

36:00.785 --> 36:01.953
Why not?

36:04.872 --> 36:07.041
Because I'm still holding
a candle for you.

36:10.127 --> 36:11.128
Um...

36:12.213 --> 36:14.215
I find that hard to believe.

36:16.259 --> 36:19.554
My mom died when I was nine
and my dad never remarried, so...

36:21.681 --> 36:23.724
People hold candles, Nora.

36:30.481 --> 36:31.899
How is your dad?

36:32.066 --> 36:34.235
He's fantastic.

36:34.610 --> 36:35.778
Jesus.

36:36.821 --> 36:38.447
He's 91. He's still kicking.

36:38.614 --> 36:39.824
Oh, he must be immortal.

36:40.241 --> 36:42.994
Runs in the family, right?

36:45.580 --> 36:47.206
- I'm not immortal.
- Oh?

36:47.707 --> 36:48.958
Says who?

36:49.417 --> 36:50.710
My cardiologist.

36:52.545 --> 36:54.130
I had a condition.

36:54.297 --> 36:56.424
It was undiagnosed my whole life.

36:58.217 --> 37:00.261
Couple years back, I had a heart attack.

37:01.637 --> 37:03.806
Pretty... Pretty bad one.

37:06.475 --> 37:11.022
But if they hadn't diagnosed the condition
then I wouldn't have known I'd had it,

37:11.188 --> 37:16.110
and blah, blah, blah, so,
they just cut me open, put in a pacemaker.

37:16.611 --> 37:17.612
Really?

37:17.778 --> 37:19.238
Yeah, really.

37:19.947 --> 37:20.990
Wanna see my scar?

37:22.366 --> 37:23.534
<i>She came!</i>

37:23.993 --> 37:25.661
You said she wouldn't come.

37:25.870 --> 37:27.830
Oh.
I'm just as surprised as you are.

37:30.291 --> 37:32.460
Aggie, this is Nora. Nora, this is Aggie.

37:32.627 --> 37:34.086
- Congratulations.
- He didn't think you were coming.

37:34.253 --> 37:35.922
Uh, yeah, you mentioned that.

37:36.255 --> 37:38.174
Nice of you to get all dressed up
for my wedding.

37:38.341 --> 37:40.134
I'm sorry,
I didn't know it was your wedding.

37:40.301 --> 37:41.636
I'm just fucking with you.

37:42.011 --> 37:43.012
She's very serious.

37:43.179 --> 37:44.263
Yeah.

37:44.430 --> 37:46.015
Wouldn't have it any other way.

37:46.849 --> 37:48.059
All right, that's enough chitchat.

37:48.225 --> 37:49.560
Did you write your messages?

37:50.686 --> 37:52.438
Um, uh, I gave mine to the nun.

37:55.399 --> 37:56.859
Uh, what about you, sweetheart?

37:58.527 --> 38:01.072
Want to write a message of love
to send out to the world?

38:01.864 --> 38:03.032
No, thank you.

38:03.699 --> 38:05.201
And she's a romantic, too.

38:06.619 --> 38:08.245
All right, let's get this over with!

38:08.871 --> 38:10.539
Where the fuck's Eddie?

38:14.335 --> 38:16.045
What did you tell her about us?

38:17.964 --> 38:19.924
I told her I had a crush on a girl,

38:20.091 --> 38:25.179
and I wanted to chase after her,
but I didn't know what to say.

38:30.351 --> 38:32.269
<i>All right, everyone, settle down.</i>

38:32.895 --> 38:34.397
I'm talking now!

38:34.647 --> 38:35.648
Oi!

38:35.815 --> 38:37.483
Listen up, fuckwits!

38:40.736 --> 38:46.033
All right. Dearest family,
beloved friends, and Russell.

38:46.367 --> 38:47.576
Aye!

38:48.911 --> 38:52.331
Eddie and I just wanna thank you all
for being here on our special day

38:52.498 --> 38:55.334
to drink our alcohol free of charge.

38:58.254 --> 39:03.426
Sweetheart, I'm so happy that we're gonna
spend the rest of our lives together.

39:03.926 --> 39:06.929
And now that you've married me,
I have a confession.

39:07.722 --> 39:09.557
I think I might be pregnant.

39:11.100 --> 39:12.101
No!

39:12.643 --> 39:15.271
Not to worry, love. It's yours, probably.

39:17.440 --> 39:19.942
<i>All right, let's get to the ooey gooey.</i>

39:20.109 --> 39:22.486
We have gathered your notes

39:22.653 --> 39:25.114
and attached them
to these beautiful birds.

39:27.116 --> 39:29.160
And now we are going to set them free

39:29.326 --> 39:32.788
so they can fly off
to every corner of the world,

39:32.955 --> 39:35.708
spreading those messages of love
to people everywhere.

39:36.709 --> 39:38.002
Aw!

39:38.461 --> 39:39.879
All right, Sister.

39:40.671 --> 39:42.339
Release the birds!

39:55.019 --> 39:56.270
What did you write?

40:00.816 --> 40:04.445
That's for me to know
and some lonely Eskimo to find out.

40:05.154 --> 40:07.323
Isn't that romantic, eh?

40:08.157 --> 40:10.701
Yeah, let's hear it for the love birds!

40:15.581 --> 40:18.417
See, if only life was just about love.

40:19.794 --> 40:21.378
But it's about temptation.

40:21.921 --> 40:23.672
It's about failure.

40:24.632 --> 40:26.008
It's about weakness.

40:26.175 --> 40:28.761
You know what I'm talking about,
don't you, Sister?

40:29.386 --> 40:31.680
It's about sin, yeah.

40:31.847 --> 40:35.017
And everybody here knows
I've made my fair share of mistakes.

40:35.559 --> 40:40.606
<i>But there is a very big difference
between a sin and a mistake.</i>

40:41.023 --> 40:43.567
<i>Because a mistake is just fucking up. Hmm?</i>

40:44.193 --> 40:45.945
<i>But a sin, ooh-hoo.</i>

40:46.153 --> 40:50.366
<i>A sin is when you know something
is wrong and you do it anyway.</i>

40:53.202 --> 40:59.041
So, Aggie, my darling wife,
my sun and my stars,

40:59.542 --> 41:00.918
I look forward to a lifetime

41:01.085 --> 41:02.419
of fucking up with you.

41:03.254 --> 41:07.758
But I hereby swear I will never sin again.

41:08.300 --> 41:09.301
Aw.

41:16.350 --> 41:17.893
Now bring out that fucking goat!

41:19.395 --> 41:20.604
<i>Yeah!</i>

41:21.272 --> 41:22.314
<i>Hello!</i>

41:22.690 --> 41:25.276
In biblical times,
a goat was designated to be

41:25.442 --> 41:28.737
driven into the desert with the sins
of the community upon it.

41:29.155 --> 41:30.906
So...

41:31.157 --> 41:33.784
Let these beads represent our sins.

41:36.829 --> 41:38.873
Unburden yourselves, friends.

41:39.999 --> 41:44.253
Then Russell will drive the scapegoat
deep into the bush, far from here,

41:44.420 --> 41:49.008
so we can start over
untainted by our past misdeeds.

42:01.937 --> 42:03.439
At least they didn't sacrifice it.

42:05.399 --> 42:07.943
Have you ever seen somebody
sacrifice a goat?

42:08.777 --> 42:09.820
No.

42:10.112 --> 42:11.530
That'd be weird.

42:37.223 --> 42:38.599
Will you dance with me?

44:54.985 --> 44:57.029
How did you find me, Kevin?

45:00.574 --> 45:02.868
I'm on vacation in Australia.

45:05.120 --> 45:06.705
I saw you ride by on your bike.

45:11.126 --> 45:12.419
I can't do this.

45:13.837 --> 45:15.089
Why not?

45:15.506 --> 45:17.299
Because it's not true.

47:32.768 --> 47:34.019
Evening.

48:08.262 --> 48:09.346
Sarah.

48:09.513 --> 48:11.014
What did you do with my birds?

48:11.473 --> 48:13.976
I let them go just like I always do.

48:14.351 --> 48:15.352
What's wrong?

48:15.519 --> 48:16.895
What's wrong is that
they didn't come back.

48:17.062 --> 48:18.730
Did you give them the seed
that I gave you?

48:18.897 --> 48:19.982
Yes, of course.

48:20.148 --> 48:22.776
And... And you didn't feed them
right before you let them go, did you?

48:22.943 --> 48:25.153
No, of course not.
I did everything the same.

48:25.320 --> 48:27.322
- Then where are they?
- I don't know.

48:27.489 --> 48:30.701
Those birds are trained to do one thing,
just one thing, and that's to come home.

48:30.867 --> 48:32.286
So you must've done something different.

48:32.452 --> 48:34.705
Maybe they're delivering
the messages of love.

48:35.831 --> 48:39.126
It's great that your newlyweds believe
that a bird with a range of 50 miles

48:39.293 --> 48:41.336
is gonna carry their
stupid poetry to Timbuktu,

48:41.503 --> 48:42.921
but don't sell that bullshit to me.

48:43.171 --> 48:45.716
I'm not trying to sell you anything.

48:47.384 --> 48:49.344
It's just a nicer story.

48:51.305 --> 48:52.431
Who was that man?

48:53.682 --> 48:55.851
- What man?
<i>- The man I just saw leaving.</i>

48:56.685 --> 48:58.186
You mean Father Brian.

48:58.353 --> 49:00.105
He's the only man
permitted in the convent.

49:01.356 --> 49:03.358
Does Father Brian ride a motorcycle?

49:03.609 --> 49:05.694
- No.
- Well, this man did.

49:05.861 --> 49:08.697
And he was climbing a ladder
down from that room right up there.

49:09.406 --> 49:10.407
Oh...

49:10.741 --> 49:12.159
Well, that's strange.

49:12.326 --> 49:13.493
Is that your room?

49:13.994 --> 49:15.370
It might be.

49:16.121 --> 49:18.332
But I certainly haven't seen
any men on ladders.

49:19.499 --> 49:21.043
You just had sex with him.

49:21.209 --> 49:22.502
Oh, no, I didn't.

49:22.669 --> 49:23.920
- You did.
- Did not.

49:24.087 --> 49:25.505
Then swear to God.

49:26.131 --> 49:27.466
All right.

49:29.134 --> 49:30.677
I swear to God.

49:31.637 --> 49:33.513
You're a fucking liar!

49:37.017 --> 49:39.353
I saw you dancing with that man.

49:40.228 --> 49:42.648
That man you said you didn't know.

49:47.277 --> 49:50.113
I'll pray for the safe return
of your birds.

49:51.406 --> 49:53.408
Don't waste your breath.

50:35.742 --> 50:36.952
Oh, God.

50:53.218 --> 50:54.469
Oh, God.

51:46.813 --> 51:47.814
Ah!

52:31.066 --> 52:33.193
Oh!

52:38.156 --> 52:39.866
Oh.

52:41.117 --> 52:42.285
I know.

52:42.994 --> 52:44.162
Okay.

53:35.046 --> 53:36.715
Hey, you hungry?

54:25.889 --> 54:26.973
Hey!

54:32.854 --> 54:34.397
Eat this, you idiot.

54:35.398 --> 54:37.359
Here. Come on.

55:51.057 --> 55:52.726
You wanna know how I found you, Nora?

55:54.936 --> 55:56.146
You want the truth?

56:01.026 --> 56:03.361
When Matt told me you were gone,
I didn't believe him.

56:05.321 --> 56:06.448
Or I couldn't.

56:06.740 --> 56:07.907
I just...

56:08.283 --> 56:10.577
I had this feeling that
you were still alive...

56:11.619 --> 56:13.288
And that I would see you again.

56:16.624 --> 56:20.128
And then... Then Matt died
and you weren't even at the funeral.

56:20.795 --> 56:22.338
And that should've convinced me,

56:23.131 --> 56:27.177
but I couldn't believe that the last time
I saw you or talked to you

56:27.343 --> 56:31.473
was in that fucking hotel room
that night I burned this fucking book.

56:35.643 --> 56:38.480
I was so sure

56:38.980 --> 56:40.732
you were still alive even though
everyone else in the world

56:40.899 --> 56:42.776
said that you were fucking dead.

56:45.779 --> 56:46.821
God, I...

56:48.490 --> 56:50.158
I had to do something about it.

56:52.035 --> 56:54.954
So I decided that
I was gonna look for you.

56:57.665 --> 56:59.501
I was gonna start right where I lost you.

57:02.670 --> 57:05.757
Every year, I have two weeks of vacation,

57:05.924 --> 57:08.176
and every year,
I come to fucking Australia

57:08.343 --> 57:10.678
and I show your picture
to everybody I meet.

57:12.013 --> 57:13.264
<i>"Do you know this woman?</i>

57:13.556 --> 57:15.183
"Have you ever seen her before?"

57:15.850 --> 57:16.851
And they all just

57:17.018 --> 57:19.354
look at me and they shake their heads
and they say, "Oh, I'm sorry."

57:20.063 --> 57:21.981
Everybody's so fucking sorry.

57:23.149 --> 57:24.901
But I couldn't stop.

57:27.112 --> 57:30.406
Every year, I would say to myself,
I can't do this.

57:31.032 --> 57:32.200
I'm not doing this.

57:32.742 --> 57:33.827
Never again.

57:34.202 --> 57:35.870
But every year, I would come back.

57:37.205 --> 57:38.248
<i>Because...</i>

57:40.041 --> 57:41.417
<i>Because I couldn't stop.</i>

57:44.045 --> 57:45.630
And a couple days ago...

57:47.090 --> 57:48.758
I showed your picture to that nun...

57:50.301 --> 57:51.845
And I saw it in her eyes.

57:52.762 --> 57:53.972
She recognized you.

57:56.057 --> 57:57.267
She knew you.

58:00.270 --> 58:01.688
And when I saw you...

58:05.525 --> 58:07.110
I couldn't believe it.

58:09.487 --> 58:11.030
There you were.

58:13.032 --> 58:14.576
And I was so...

58:20.206 --> 58:22.125
But I didn't know what to say...

58:25.044 --> 58:28.464
Or where to start, and so I just thought,
"Oh, fuck it. I'll erase it."

58:28.882 --> 58:31.718
Just erase it all and maybe that would

58:31.885 --> 58:33.428
give us another chance.

58:37.265 --> 58:38.474
<i>But you were right.</i>

58:41.227 --> 58:42.395
It's not true.

58:46.274 --> 58:47.901
That's how I found you, Nora.

58:48.359 --> 58:49.444
I...

58:52.113 --> 58:53.948
I refused to believe you were gone.

58:59.787 --> 59:01.456
You want some tea?

59:05.126 --> 59:06.252
What?

59:07.378 --> 59:09.631
I was gonna make a cup of tea.
You want some?

59:13.134 --> 59:14.219
Okay.

59:29.567 --> 59:30.735
You want one?

59:31.819 --> 59:32.820
No.

59:32.987 --> 59:34.030
I quit.

59:36.866 --> 59:37.909
Heart.

59:41.412 --> 59:42.956
So that part is true.

59:43.998 --> 59:44.999
Mmm-hmm.

59:47.502 --> 59:49.170
That part is true.

59:54.217 --> 59:55.677
What else is true?

1:00:00.348 --> 1:00:02.558
Everything I said about Matt's funeral.

1:00:04.686 --> 1:00:06.980
Everything I told you about
Jill and Tommy...

1:00:07.647 --> 1:00:08.690
My father.

1:00:09.524 --> 1:00:11.359
Did you move back to Mapleton?

1:00:12.110 --> 1:00:13.152
No.

1:00:13.736 --> 1:00:15.071
I'm still in Jarden.

1:00:16.281 --> 1:00:17.365
In our house.

1:00:18.032 --> 1:00:19.993
Anyone still call it Miracle?

1:00:20.702 --> 1:00:21.869
Not so much.

1:00:22.495 --> 1:00:23.830
How are the Murphys?

1:00:25.415 --> 1:00:27.500
Uh, Michael's pretty much running
the church now.

1:00:29.627 --> 1:00:31.587
I see Erika there every once in a while.

1:00:32.380 --> 1:00:33.506
She's great.

1:00:34.882 --> 1:00:36.884
And, uh, John and Laurie
still live next door.

1:00:42.223 --> 1:00:44.142
I talk to Laurie sometimes.

1:00:47.228 --> 1:00:49.230
- What?
- Every once in a while.

1:00:49.814 --> 1:00:51.566
Just when I need to.

1:00:53.568 --> 1:00:54.652
She knows you're here?

1:00:54.819 --> 1:00:56.070
Don't be mad at her.

1:00:56.237 --> 1:00:58.406
She's my therapist.
She wasn't allowed to tell you.

1:00:59.032 --> 1:01:00.575
Why didn't you tell me?

1:01:01.576 --> 1:01:03.619
Because you were right, Kevin.

1:01:04.912 --> 1:01:06.831
What you said in the hotel...

1:01:07.749 --> 1:01:09.584
The last time we saw each other.

1:01:11.294 --> 1:01:12.754
I needed to be with my kids.

1:01:12.920 --> 1:01:16.215
- Uh, no, I didn't mean that...
<i>- You meant it, and you were right, Kevin.</i>

1:01:16.591 --> 1:01:20.386
There were always gonna be
bulletproof vests...

1:01:21.095 --> 1:01:22.680
Hugs from holy men...

1:01:23.973 --> 1:01:25.767
Tattoos to cover up.

1:01:27.518 --> 1:01:30.688
But those were just ways
to deal with what I lost.

1:01:33.608 --> 1:01:35.735
I needed a way to get them back.

1:01:38.613 --> 1:01:40.865
I knew there was a chance
it would kill me,

1:01:41.616 --> 1:01:43.368
but I made my peace with that.

1:01:45.453 --> 1:01:47.538
And I said goodbye to my brother...

1:01:49.165 --> 1:01:50.917
And I climbed right in.

1:01:58.299 --> 1:02:00.134
And then you changed your mind.

1:02:01.552 --> 1:02:02.595
No.

1:02:03.638 --> 1:02:05.098
I didn't change my mind.

1:02:08.059 --> 1:02:09.227
I went through.

1:02:18.361 --> 1:02:20.071
I was in the parking lot...

1:02:21.155 --> 1:02:22.407
Naked...

1:02:23.908 --> 1:02:25.493
Curled up like a baby.

1:02:28.329 --> 1:02:32.291
It was the same parking lot I'd just
been in, except there were no trucks...

1:02:33.459 --> 1:02:35.711
No people, no nothing.

1:02:41.008 --> 1:02:43.803
It was cold, so I started to walk.

1:02:45.304 --> 1:02:48.015
I walked by empty houses...

1:02:49.016 --> 1:02:50.810
Abandoned buildings.

1:02:52.103 --> 1:02:54.272
And I found a store,

1:02:54.522 --> 1:02:56.607
so I went in and there
were clothes there...

1:02:56.774 --> 1:02:59.694
Clothes hanging on racks.
So I got dressed

1:03:00.486 --> 1:03:02.280
and I got back to walking.

1:03:06.617 --> 1:03:08.536
I walked long enough to convince myself

1:03:08.703 --> 1:03:11.205
that I was the only thing
alive in that place.

1:03:12.623 --> 1:03:17.753
And then night came and I saw lights,
so I went to them.

1:03:19.130 --> 1:03:23.426
It was a house, and there was a man
and a woman there.

1:03:24.427 --> 1:03:28.222
They were kind and they told me,

1:03:29.724 --> 1:03:33.269
the man told me that seven years earlier,

1:03:33.436 --> 1:03:37.857
he was in a supermarket and every single
person disappeared except for him.

1:03:40.610 --> 1:03:44.906
And the woman told me
that she lost her husband,

1:03:45.573 --> 1:03:49.076
her three daughters,
and all eight of her grandchildren.

1:03:51.037 --> 1:03:52.955
And that's when I understood.

1:03:54.207 --> 1:03:58.085
Over here, we lost some of them.

1:03:59.086 --> 1:04:02.757
But over there, they lost all of us.

1:04:07.261 --> 1:04:09.639
So, I went and did
what I came there to do.

1:04:11.682 --> 1:04:13.392
I went to find my kids.

1:04:16.812 --> 1:04:18.439
Planes don't really fly over there.

1:04:18.606 --> 1:04:21.442
They have the resources,
just not enough pilots.

1:04:22.276 --> 1:04:24.445
So I found a boat that would take me.

1:04:25.905 --> 1:04:29.116
No boats go directly
from Australia to New York,

1:04:29.492 --> 1:04:32.370
so it took me a long time to get there.

1:04:34.288 --> 1:04:35.706
A long time.

1:04:37.625 --> 1:04:39.293
But I finally did.

1:04:44.799 --> 1:04:47.009
And I walked through Mapleton.

1:04:49.887 --> 1:04:54.183
I walked through
the town where I grew up...

1:04:58.437 --> 1:05:00.398
Where my parents died...

1:05:00.856 --> 1:05:02.149
And Matt.

1:05:05.319 --> 1:05:07.071
Where you and I met.

1:05:10.032 --> 1:05:12.535
Most of the houses
were overgrown with weeds,

1:05:12.827 --> 1:05:14.829
but the streetlights still
turned on at night,

1:05:14.996 --> 1:05:18.583
and that made me feel less stupid
about expecting them still to be there.

1:05:19.584 --> 1:05:22.712
Still there in the very same house
where I lost them.

1:05:25.006 --> 1:05:28.342
When I got there, I stood behind a tree
across the street and I waited

1:05:28.718 --> 1:05:31.095
because I was too scared
to go up and knock.

1:05:34.265 --> 1:05:38.019
And then, after a while, the door opened.

1:05:42.023 --> 1:05:43.899
At first, I didn't recognize them.

1:05:45.901 --> 1:05:50.156
A tall teenage boy

1:05:50.906 --> 1:05:52.575
with curly hair

1:05:55.870 --> 1:05:59.040
and a girl, maybe 11.

1:06:02.668 --> 1:06:04.253
They were my children.

1:06:12.428 --> 1:06:15.389
And then my husband came out,
and he was with a woman.

1:06:15.556 --> 1:06:16.807
She was pretty.

1:06:17.224 --> 1:06:21.187
She was pretty, and they were all smiling.

1:06:26.317 --> 1:06:27.735
They were

1:06:30.112 --> 1:06:31.280
happy.

1:06:34.408 --> 1:06:40.414
And I understood that here in this place,
they were the lucky ones.

1:06:43.751 --> 1:06:46.128
In a world full of orphans,

1:06:47.046 --> 1:06:48.839
they still had each other.

1:06:52.927 --> 1:06:54.595
And I was a ghost.

1:06:57.306 --> 1:06:59.934
I was a ghost who had no place there.

1:07:04.855 --> 1:07:08.317
And that, Kevin,
is when I changed my mind.

1:07:13.531 --> 1:07:15.241
The physicists who sent me through

1:07:15.408 --> 1:07:18.452
told me the first person to use the
machine was the guy who invented it.

1:07:20.162 --> 1:07:22.123
His name was Dr. Van Eeghan.

1:07:23.416 --> 1:07:24.834
I'm pretty sure they were
making fun of me,

1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:28.129
but they said when I went over
that I should look him up, so I did.

1:07:28.796 --> 1:07:30.548
That took a long time, too.

1:07:32.133 --> 1:07:33.467
But I found him,

1:07:34.635 --> 1:07:38.347
and I asked him to make another machine
because he already knew how.

1:07:39.390 --> 1:07:40.641
And he asked me

1:07:41.600 --> 1:07:44.979
if I'd come all that way, why in
God's name did I wanna go back?

1:07:45.146 --> 1:07:47.982
And I told him
it's because I didn't belong there.

1:07:49.191 --> 1:07:50.443
So he built it.

1:07:51.610 --> 1:07:53.237
And I came back through.

1:07:54.321 --> 1:07:55.614
I came back here.

1:08:06.500 --> 1:08:07.752
Did I...

1:08:10.504 --> 1:08:11.756
Think about you?

1:08:18.679 --> 1:08:20.473
Did I wanna call you?

1:08:23.350 --> 1:08:25.519
Did I wanna be with you, Kevin?

1:08:26.729 --> 1:08:28.063
Of course I did.

1:08:32.943 --> 1:08:35.070
But so much time had passed.

1:08:39.074 --> 1:08:41.911
It was too late.

1:08:47.333 --> 1:08:51.587
And I knew that if I told you
what happened

1:08:52.880 --> 1:08:54.799
that you would never believe me.

1:09:02.765 --> 1:09:04.266
I believe you.

1:09:15.820 --> 1:09:17.029
You do?

1:09:19.073 --> 1:09:20.783
Why wouldn't I believe you?

1:09:23.077 --> 1:09:24.495
You're here.

1:09:50.104 --> 1:09:51.355
I'm here.

1:11:51.100 --> 1:11:52.101
