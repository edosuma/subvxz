00:25.987 --> 00:27.254
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:27.255 --> 00:29.122
Why aren't you
guys in costume?

00:29.123 --> 00:31.258
No one's gonna give you candy
without a costume.

00:31.259 --> 00:33.793
Oh, is that how
trick or treating works, Darryl?

00:33.794 --> 00:35.495
Yes.
How do we get the candy?

00:35.496 --> 00:36.630
You put on a costume.
Okay.

00:36.631 --> 00:37.764
And you go door to door.

00:37.765 --> 00:39.633
Oh, no... we put on a costume!

00:39.634 --> 00:41.875
Relax! We've got
the costume of costumes.

00:41.903 --> 00:43.436
No need for the
attitude, Louise.

00:43.437 --> 00:44.838
I just don't want you
to not have candy.

00:44.839 --> 00:46.139
I know, Darryl.

00:46.140 --> 00:47.507
Concern's coming
from a good place.

00:47.508 --> 00:49.176
We're going as
a Chinese Dragon.

00:49.177 --> 00:50.777
They'll be five of us inside.

00:50.778 --> 00:52.245
But we'll say there's ten of us.

00:52.246 --> 00:53.513
It's a trick to get more treats.

00:53.514 --> 00:55.248
We'll be swimming in nougat.

00:55.249 --> 00:57.484
I remember when I thought group
costumes were a good idea.

00:57.485 --> 00:58.652
Too much work!

00:58.653 --> 00:59.819
And not enough friends.

00:59.820 --> 01:01.121
I'll admit,
it's ambitious,

01:01.122 --> 01:03.190
but we have
our best people on it.

01:03.191 --> 01:05.191
Why do we even have to do this?

01:05.193 --> 01:06.927
Come on, is it so
hard to glue things?

01:06.928 --> 01:08.828
And run a restaurant?
Yeah, it is.

01:08.829 --> 01:10.463
Well, this is
what parents do.

01:10.464 --> 01:12.299
They glue crap on stuff
for their kids... so glue!

01:12.300 --> 01:13.533
I'm gluing.
We got a lot of stuff.

01:13.534 --> 01:15.168
Glue, glue, glue!
I said...

01:15.169 --> 01:16.703
Glue!
Please don't chant glue.

01:16.704 --> 01:18.305
And glue and
glue and glue!

01:18.306 --> 01:20.106
I think I'm too old
to trick-or-treat.

01:20.107 --> 01:21.675
Next year I'm going
cold turkey.

01:21.676 --> 01:23.043
When you go
from tween to teen,

01:23.044 --> 01:24.544
you say good-bye
to Halloween.

01:24.545 --> 01:26.379
You're never too old
for trick-or-treating.

01:26.380 --> 01:28.114
Or holding hands
with dad.

01:28.115 --> 01:30.050
When I say "Lou,"
you say "Eez."

01:30.051 --> 01:31.885
Lou!
Oh, God.

01:31.886 --> 01:33.820
- When I say Lou, you say Eez!
- Where is she?

01:33.821 --> 01:34.821
Lou...

01:34.822 --> 01:35.822
Who's that?

01:35.823 --> 01:36.823
It's Millie Frock.

01:36.824 --> 01:38.291
She wants to be my friend

01:38.292 --> 01:40.493
or be me
or be a rap duo with me.

01:40.494 --> 01:41.494
That's nice.

01:41.495 --> 01:43.797
No, it's not nice, Tina!

01:43.798 --> 01:45.198
It's not nice at all.
Lou...

01:45.199 --> 01:46.466
... Eez!
Aah! No!

01:46.467 --> 01:47.867
Oh, hi, Louise.

01:47.868 --> 01:49.469
Tickle, tickle,
tickle, tickle.

01:49.470 --> 01:50.470
Stop it!

01:50.471 --> 01:51.972
What are you dressed as?

01:51.973 --> 01:53.039
Remember?
Remember our plan?

01:53.040 --> 01:54.241
You don't remember our plan?

01:54.242 --> 01:55.742
You be dust,
I'll be bunny.

01:55.743 --> 01:56.910
Dust bunny!

02:00.381 --> 02:02.048
That is not our plan, Millie.

02:02.049 --> 02:03.416
We didn't have a plan.

02:03.417 --> 02:04.884
And even if we did,

02:04.885 --> 02:06.853
even if we did get together
and sit down,

02:06.854 --> 02:07.988
get some blueprints out,

02:07.989 --> 02:09.189
have a cup of coffee,

02:09.190 --> 02:10.690
why would I want to be dust?

02:10.691 --> 02:11.691
Dust!

02:11.692 --> 02:13.193
So you could be bunny?

02:13.194 --> 02:14.761
Why?
That's exactly

02:14.762 --> 02:16.096
what dust would say.

02:16.097 --> 02:18.098
Good-bye.

02:22.870 --> 02:24.271
Can't help
but notice you're not playing

02:24.272 --> 02:26.239
the <i>Halloween Scream</i> CD
I gave you.

02:26.240 --> 02:28.241
Uh, you know, I didn't
want to wear it out

02:28.242 --> 02:29.276
before the kids
started coming around.

02:29.277 --> 02:30.844
Where is it?
You have to... Oh!

02:30.845 --> 02:32.279
- It's right there! Behind you!
- Oh, great.

02:32.280 --> 02:33.446
Well, it can't
play itself, Bob.

02:33.447 --> 02:34.848
You got to put it on
and hit "play."

02:34.882 --> 02:35.949
Bobby, come on.

02:35.950 --> 02:37.384
Play the sounds
of the holiday.

02:37.385 --> 02:39.386
Well, we don't need
to right now, Teddy.

02:39.387 --> 02:41.021
- Why not?
- We'll wait till the kids come.

02:41.022 --> 02:42.088
Why?
 Fine.

02:42.089 --> 02:44.357
I'll just put it in.

02:46.560 --> 02:48.361
Ooh.
I'm spooked.

02:48.362 --> 02:50.196
Now you're all set for trick or
treaters in a couple of hours.

02:50.197 --> 02:51.798
Wait, what time is it?

02:51.799 --> 02:53.433
Oh, my God, Bobby,
the kids'll be home any minute!

02:53.434 --> 02:54.734
And the costume's
not even close to finished.

02:54.735 --> 02:56.303
What are we gonna do?

02:56.304 --> 02:58.405
I don't know.
How about let them finish it?

02:58.406 --> 03:00.573
Mort, Teddy,
wh-what are you doing right now?

03:00.574 --> 03:02.475
Adjusting myself
without anyone noticing.

03:02.476 --> 03:04.044
Watching Mort adjust himself.

03:04.045 --> 03:05.445
Grab some glue.
Gonna be our Halloween elves!

03:05.446 --> 03:06.780
Come on,
you don't have to be good,

03:06.781 --> 03:08.081
you just have to be fast.

03:08.082 --> 03:10.083
Why can't
all women want that?

03:10.084 --> 03:11.384
All right, we'll go home,

03:11.385 --> 03:13.119
finish the costume
and hit the streets.

03:13.120 --> 03:15.722
Oh, I need to grab
the dragon eyes from the fort.

03:15.723 --> 03:16.956
Why are they
in the fort?

03:16.957 --> 03:18.458
I spray-painted
them in there.

03:20.261 --> 03:22.395
Fine, we'll swing by the fort.

03:22.396 --> 03:23.496
Yay!

03:23.497 --> 03:24.497
Fort, fort, fort!

03:24.498 --> 03:25.899
Fort? Hmm.

03:25.900 --> 03:27.634
I didn't peg you guys
as the forting type.

03:27.635 --> 03:28.802
Oh, we fort.

03:28.803 --> 03:31.438
We fort big-time.

03:33.074 --> 03:34.774
After you.

03:34.775 --> 03:36.343
Uh... I don't know.

03:36.344 --> 03:38.278
I got this thing about
being in small spaces.

03:38.279 --> 03:39.646
Oh, you're gonna
be fine, Darryl.

03:39.647 --> 03:40.647
Trust me.

03:40.648 --> 03:42.082
When you come out of here,

03:42.083 --> 03:44.084
you're gonna be afraid
of this small space...

03:44.085 --> 03:45.318
that is the world.

03:45.319 --> 03:47.587
Hey Lou Lou, where are you you?

03:47.588 --> 03:49.255
Oh no, no, no, no, no!

03:49.256 --> 03:51.024
She's right here.
I'm looking at her.

03:51.025 --> 03:53.193
Shut up!

03:53.194 --> 03:54.327
Quick, inside!

03:56.530 --> 03:57.630
Hey, are we gonna play
in the fort

03:57.631 --> 03:59.199
before we go trick-or-treating?

03:59.200 --> 04:00.367
'Cause, uh... Louise,
you, you shut the door

04:00.368 --> 04:01.868
before I could even get in.

04:01.869 --> 04:04.871
Oh, sorry, Millie,
we're at capacity, so...

04:04.872 --> 04:06.272
You always say that.

04:06.273 --> 04:07.540
Now, come on, let me in!

04:07.541 --> 04:09.175
Yeah, ah, god,
I sure wish I could

04:09.176 --> 04:11.711
but it's kind of a one-in,
one-out situation.

04:11.712 --> 04:13.947
The fire marshal's on our ass.

04:13.948 --> 04:15.648
You understand, Millie.

04:15.649 --> 04:16.850
Well, I'll wait.

04:16.851 --> 04:17.851
Or-or you could

04:17.851 --> 04:18.952
come back later, too.

04:18.952 --> 04:19.952
We'll be here a while.

04:19.954 --> 04:21.454
It'll thin out in a bit.

04:21.454 --> 04:23.123
I'll get some more dust
for our costumes!

04:23.124 --> 04:24.324
Dust bunny, think about it.

04:24.325 --> 04:25.692
Seriously, think about it.

04:25.693 --> 04:27.327
Okay, yeah.
I'm knocking it around

04:27.328 --> 04:28.661
in my head right now.

04:28.662 --> 04:30.397
I think it's
gonna be awesome!

04:30.398 --> 04:31.398
All right, Millie.

04:31.399 --> 04:32.699
It's gonna be great!

04:32.700 --> 04:34.234
Bye, babe.
â™ª La, la, la, la.

04:34.235 --> 04:35.535
Whew, that was close.

04:35.536 --> 04:36.703
Hurry up and get
the dragon eyes

04:36.704 --> 04:38.238
before crazy comes back.

04:38.239 --> 04:40.039
This fort is amazing.

04:40.040 --> 04:42.175
I only feel
a little claustrophobic.

04:42.176 --> 04:43.576
This would be
a great place to go

04:43.577 --> 04:45.044
when my mom tells me
to go play outside.

04:45.045 --> 04:46.212
All right, come on.

04:46.213 --> 04:47.414
We'll give you the quickie tour.

04:47.415 --> 04:48.481
This is Gene's room.

04:48.482 --> 04:50.049
There's some odor.
Yes.

04:50.050 --> 04:52.018
Found them!
And now the upstairs.

04:52.019 --> 04:53.052
There's an upstairs?

04:53.053 --> 04:55.021
Oh, yeah.

04:55.022 --> 04:56.656
This is Tina's room.

04:56.657 --> 04:58.758
- You can really feel the insecurity.
- Hmm. Mm.

04:58.759 --> 04:59.926
I think it's nice.

04:59.927 --> 05:01.361
You don't think it's nice?

05:01.362 --> 05:03.563
No, no, it's nice.
It's nice.

05:03.564 --> 05:04.564
VoilÃ.

05:04.565 --> 05:06.266
Parlor de la Louise.

05:06.267 --> 05:08.568
Lovely view.

05:08.569 --> 05:10.870
The light's bad
for the upholstery.

05:10.871 --> 05:12.772
- True, fading... it is an issue.
- Yeah.

05:12.773 --> 05:14.441
So, what house will
be the first stop

05:14.442 --> 05:16.409
on Tina's farewell
trick-or-treating tour?

05:16.410 --> 05:17.710
Leave that to me.

05:17.711 --> 05:19.345
This town might suck
at Halloween,

05:19.346 --> 05:20.580
but not if you have this.

05:20.581 --> 05:21.881
I give you...
the Treasure Trail.

05:21.882 --> 05:22.882
Whoa!

05:22.883 --> 05:25.051
Wow!

05:25.052 --> 05:26.719
It took phone-polling,
mailing-lists,

05:26.720 --> 05:29.389
and a blog I follow
called <i>Candy Randy.</i>

05:29.390 --> 05:31.057
So houses with stars are?

05:31.058 --> 05:32.258
Those are must-visits.

05:32.259 --> 05:34.427
And houses with an X?
Must-avoids.

05:34.428 --> 05:35.695
I'm talking raisins, pencils,

05:35.696 --> 05:37.730
hand sanitizer, baby apples.

05:37.731 --> 05:38.932
Sayonara, raisins.

05:38.933 --> 05:40.266
Old grapes aren't candy!

05:42.703 --> 05:44.471
Do you guys hear that?
What the...?

05:47.107 --> 05:48.641
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

05:48.642 --> 05:50.043
Hey, hey, hey!

05:51.979 --> 05:53.112
Kids, kids inside!

05:53.113 --> 05:54.314
Precious kids!

05:54.315 --> 05:56.049
Yeah, Dino, I'm coming.

05:56.050 --> 05:57.083
I'm coming. I just parked.

05:57.084 --> 05:58.818
Yeah.

05:58.819 --> 06:01.588
I can leave it
in the alley all night,

06:01.589 --> 06:03.256
no one ever comes back here.
Yeah, I'm in costume.

06:03.257 --> 06:04.457
They were all out
of Draculas

06:04.458 --> 06:05.925
so I'm a fruit head
or something.

06:05.926 --> 06:08.094
Did he just say
he's parking here all night?

06:08.095 --> 06:09.329
That's what he said!

06:09.330 --> 06:11.164
Oh, my God.
We're trapped.

06:11.165 --> 06:14.167
Help!

06:22.855 --> 06:25.390
Weak spots...
find the weak spots!

06:25.391 --> 06:26.992
We can't be
totally boxed in here.

06:27.026 --> 06:28.560
Concrete.

06:28.561 --> 06:29.561
Metal.

06:29.562 --> 06:31.530
- Concrete!
- And truck.

06:31.531 --> 06:32.531
We're screwed.

06:32.532 --> 06:33.865
Until that truck moves.

06:33.866 --> 06:35.937
Which it's not
until tomorrow!

06:35.968 --> 06:38.170
Oh, man, I'm starting
to freak out here.

06:38.204 --> 06:39.571
Hello? It's later!

06:39.572 --> 06:40.806
Oh, Millie.

06:40.807 --> 06:41.873
Millie, Millie,
Millie, Millie, Millie.

06:41.908 --> 06:43.341
Louise, you in there?

06:43.376 --> 06:45.744
I am! Millie, you have
to get us out of here.

06:45.745 --> 06:47.712
Go for help!
The truck pinned us in.

06:47.713 --> 06:49.080
Someone needs to move it!

06:49.115 --> 06:51.750
What?  Oh, yeah.

06:51.784 --> 06:53.718
Get the fire department!
And the police!

06:53.719 --> 06:54.719
Just get everybody!

06:54.720 --> 06:56.288
Oh, sure! Hey, Louise.

06:56.289 --> 06:57.889
Hey, I was thinking,
let's get bunk beds

06:57.890 --> 06:59.357
and live in the forest.

06:59.392 --> 07:01.092
wow.

07:01.127 --> 07:03.795
Or matching Murphy beds
that fold up into trees!

07:03.796 --> 07:05.630
Millie,
this is Gene!

07:05.631 --> 07:06.965
Hey, could you
go for help?

07:06.966 --> 07:08.400
Oh yeah, I'm going to.

07:08.401 --> 07:10.602
Hey, when I say Lou,
you say Eez.

07:10.603 --> 07:11.636
Lou!

07:11.637 --> 07:13.505
Eez. Okay. That was fun.

07:13.506 --> 07:15.373
You can go now.

07:15.408 --> 07:16.942
Lou!
Eez.

07:16.943 --> 07:18.276
Okay, that is enough of that.

07:18.311 --> 07:20.312
Lou.
Eez. That's plenty.

07:20.346 --> 07:22.080
Lou...
Eez, Eez, Eez!

07:22.081 --> 07:24.583
Go get some help,
you frickin' nutcase!

07:24.617 --> 07:26.251
You creepy stalker
psycho kook!

07:26.252 --> 07:28.253
Can you not
understand a hint?

07:28.254 --> 07:30.655
Go... get... help!

07:30.656 --> 07:32.457
Oh, wow. I see.

07:32.458 --> 07:33.992
I see you don't like me, huh?

07:34.026 --> 07:35.627
Of course I don't! Who would?

07:35.628 --> 07:37.128
Who would?!

07:37.129 --> 07:38.163
What are you doing?

07:38.197 --> 07:39.197
Don't listen to her.

07:39.198 --> 07:40.432
This is Gene again.

07:40.433 --> 07:41.666
We think you're terrific.

07:41.667 --> 07:42.767
Did you do something
with your hair?

07:42.768 --> 07:44.269
You look great.

07:44.270 --> 07:46.404
You seem real strong.
You been working out?

07:46.439 --> 07:47.806
Louise, can you tell me this?

07:47.807 --> 07:49.174
If dust hits the ground

07:49.175 --> 07:50.375
and no one's around to hear it,

07:50.376 --> 07:51.610
does it make a sound?

07:51.644 --> 07:52.844
I don't know, Millie.

07:52.879 --> 07:54.546
No, it doesn't.

07:54.547 --> 07:56.681
So, I guess what I'm saying is

07:56.682 --> 08:00.352
have fun spending
Halloween in a box.

08:01.554 --> 08:02.554
Good one, Millie.

08:04.557 --> 08:06.491
Silly Millie.

08:06.492 --> 08:07.792
That was good.

08:07.827 --> 08:09.694
How's it coming, Teddy?
Great, Lin!

08:09.729 --> 08:11.997
All done.

08:12.031 --> 08:14.799
Teddy, is that it?
Yeah, it's a dragon spike.

08:14.800 --> 08:16.368
For the back.
Yeah, I know, Teddy.

08:16.369 --> 08:18.670
- You're supposed to have 20 done by now!
- Oh.

08:18.704 --> 08:20.572
Bobby, how's
that foot coming?

08:20.573 --> 08:22.040
Foot? I'm working
on the tail.

08:22.041 --> 08:23.642
I'm doing the tail!

08:23.643 --> 08:24.976
You're supposed
to do the foot!

08:24.977 --> 08:26.845
No, you said,
"Bob, do the tail."

08:26.846 --> 08:28.580
I know because I
remember thinking,

08:28.581 --> 08:31.149
"You can't <i>tail</i>
me what to do."

08:31.183 --> 08:33.217
Teddy?
That's funny.

08:33.219 --> 08:34.785
No, it's not!

08:34.820 --> 08:36.221
And I'm doing the tail!

08:36.222 --> 08:37.923
My tail's better
than yours!

08:37.924 --> 08:39.691
Ah...
Yours is really good.

08:39.692 --> 08:40.892
Yeah, I know it is.

08:40.893 --> 08:42.260
All right, fine!
I'll do the foot.

08:42.260 --> 08:43.828
Pass me the sequins.

08:43.828 --> 08:45.764
I would, but we're all
out because someone

08:45.765 --> 08:47.332
that's my wife
has no concept

08:47.333 --> 08:49.000
of how many sequins
she's using!

08:49.001 --> 08:50.268
Are you talking about me?

08:50.269 --> 08:51.703
God, yes.

08:51.737 --> 08:53.371
Just go get some more!
Fine!

08:53.372 --> 08:54.739
Great!

08:54.740 --> 08:56.274
This might not be
a great time,

08:56.275 --> 08:58.143
but I also made a tail.

08:59.779 --> 09:02.047
We can not miss Halloween!

09:02.048 --> 09:03.615
This is all
your fault, Louise!

09:03.616 --> 09:05.250
You were mean to Millie
and now we're stranded!

09:05.251 --> 09:06.851
Yeah! She seems...

09:06.852 --> 09:08.053
really cool.

09:08.087 --> 09:09.888
Okay, I'm hearing a lot of blame

09:09.889 --> 09:12.424
being thrown around
loosey goosey right now.

09:12.425 --> 09:14.893
â™ª Somebody's in friend jail

09:14.894 --> 09:17.295
â™ª Somebody's
in friend jail â™ª

09:17.296 --> 09:19.798
â™ª And friend jail
lasts forever. â™ª

09:19.799 --> 09:22.600
Hey, Millie.
Oh, don't mind me.

09:22.601 --> 09:25.070
I'm just collecting spiders
for an experiment.

09:25.071 --> 09:26.905
Cool, I collect
porcelain horses.

09:26.906 --> 09:28.907
I experiment with where
I put them on my dresser.

09:28.908 --> 09:31.776
Well, this experiment is called
"see how much you freak out

09:31.777 --> 09:33.745
"when I release spiders

09:33.779 --> 09:34.946
into the fort
you're trapped in."

09:38.551 --> 09:40.118
Seal it up, Gene!
Seal it!

09:40.152 --> 09:41.953
I have
a thing about spiders!

09:41.954 --> 09:43.588
You have a thing
about everything!

09:43.589 --> 09:45.523
But especially spiders.
They're scary.

09:48.127 --> 09:49.828
Andy's still in there!
Let him out!

09:49.829 --> 09:51.096
We can't!

09:51.097 --> 09:53.064
Then we'd all
get spidered!

09:53.099 --> 09:55.066
I'll never forget you, Andy.

09:55.067 --> 09:56.301
I'll be with you

09:56.302 --> 09:58.603
every time you look
in the mirror.

09:58.637 --> 10:01.473
What?
'Cause we look alike.

10:01.474 --> 10:02.474
Never mind!
Oh!

10:02.475 --> 10:03.975
No, I get it now!

10:03.976 --> 10:06.411
I didn't want those
to be my last words!

10:07.513 --> 10:09.814
Why?!
Wait a minute.

10:09.849 --> 10:11.149
Wait a minute.
What the...?

10:11.183 --> 10:13.154
Hold on.

10:13.185 --> 10:14.486
Andy, get up.

10:14.520 --> 10:16.087
They're fake spiders.

10:16.088 --> 10:18.089
I thought I was a goner.

10:18.090 --> 10:19.257
I felt you die.

10:20.426 --> 10:21.826
Oh, my God.

10:23.362 --> 10:25.063
We're closed.

10:25.097 --> 10:26.498
What? No, no, no.
I'm-I'm making a dragon.

10:26.499 --> 10:27.699
For my kids.

10:27.700 --> 10:28.933
We're-we're halfway through,

10:28.934 --> 10:30.368
We just need another bag
to finish.

10:30.369 --> 10:31.803
When you wait
until the last minute

10:31.804 --> 10:34.342
to buy art supplies,
you pay the price!

10:34.373 --> 10:35.607
Harold!

10:35.608 --> 10:37.809
You heard her, Bob Fosse.

10:37.810 --> 10:39.811
We're closed.
Bob Fosse?

10:39.812 --> 10:41.746
Look, I just need one bag.
That's it.

10:41.781 --> 10:44.249
Oh! Bob Fosse doesn't need
more than one bag.

10:44.283 --> 10:46.017
Oh!
I'm not Bob Fosse!

10:46.018 --> 10:47.819
- I'm making a costume for my...
- Ooh.

10:47.820 --> 10:49.454
- Ooh.
- I'm just taking these. Here's money.

10:49.455 --> 10:50.989
No, no!
Ooh, Mr. Bob Fosse...

10:51.023 --> 10:52.357
... just running away!

10:53.793 --> 10:54.793
Oh, no!

10:54.794 --> 10:56.161
Stop!

10:56.195 --> 10:57.762
Yes, I hear you honking!

10:57.797 --> 11:00.165
I'm just trying to make
a costume for my kids!

11:00.199 --> 11:02.000
It's a dragon!

11:02.001 --> 11:03.268
<i>Trick or treat!</i>

11:03.302 --> 11:05.670
Oh, and what are you dressed as?

11:05.704 --> 11:06.838
We switched shirts.

11:06.839 --> 11:08.807
I'm Ollie.
I'm Andy.

11:08.808 --> 11:10.475
Here's a rusted nine
volt battery for you.

11:10.476 --> 11:12.210
- Ooh.
- And a used coffee filter for you.

11:12.211 --> 11:14.212
Thanks.
Happy Halloween.

11:14.213 --> 11:15.313
Want to trade?
Yeah.

11:15.314 --> 11:16.548
This is a mockery!

11:16.549 --> 11:18.258
But I will take
a coffee filter.

11:18.259 --> 11:19.265
Thanks.

11:19.266 --> 11:20.385
This isn't how I wanted

11:20.386 --> 11:21.920
to spend
my last Halloween, Louise.

11:21.921 --> 11:23.054
I'm handing out batteries

11:23.055 --> 11:24.657
in a box full
of Gene's farts.

11:24.658 --> 11:26.324
It's not fulyet!

11:26.325 --> 11:27.325
Uh-oh.

11:28.360 --> 11:29.661
Ow!

11:29.695 --> 11:31.262
Why is my butt wet?

11:31.263 --> 11:33.331
Butts get wet, Tina.
It's what they do.

11:33.332 --> 11:34.599
Or maybe it's from that.

11:35.568 --> 11:37.268
Hmm.

11:37.269 --> 11:40.071
Must be garbage juice
from the Dumpster next door.

11:40.072 --> 11:43.041
I'm getting pinto beans,
some sandpaper...

11:43.042 --> 11:46.077
Guys, we just found our way out.

11:46.078 --> 11:48.146
Gene, is she out there?
What do you hear?

11:48.180 --> 11:50.048
Nothing.
Except for Tina's breathing.

11:50.049 --> 11:52.250
You picking that up?

11:52.251 --> 11:53.885
Loud and loud.

11:53.919 --> 11:55.587
All right, Andy, Ollie.

11:55.621 --> 11:58.189
You two and me are
the only ones small enough

11:58.190 --> 12:00.058
to fit through that hole
in the Dumpster.

12:00.059 --> 12:01.893
I would go,
but I'm master-minding this.

12:01.894 --> 12:03.094
So one of you two should go.

12:03.095 --> 12:04.195
Which one of you was born first?

12:04.230 --> 12:06.331
I was.
I came in second.

12:06.365 --> 12:08.032
All right then, Ollie,
squeeze into the dumpster,

12:08.033 --> 12:09.734
burrow through the trash,
jump out and run for help.

12:09.735 --> 12:11.436
Just like when you came
out of your mom. Got it?

12:11.470 --> 12:14.038
What did she mean by
"Came out of our mom?"

12:14.073 --> 12:16.207
Okay, Ollie, get in there.
Go, go, go, go.

12:17.743 --> 12:19.310
We just got
to get out of here, man.

12:19.311 --> 12:21.546
Whatever it takes.
Getting so cramped in here.

12:21.580 --> 12:23.481
Okay, you really don't need
to take your pants off.

12:23.482 --> 12:25.083
I wish you were right.

12:28.921 --> 12:30.054
Oh, hi.

12:30.055 --> 12:31.055
Hi.

12:31.056 --> 12:32.457
Ow!

12:32.458 --> 12:34.225
How could Millie have possibly

12:34.226 --> 12:35.426
known about our plan?

12:35.427 --> 12:37.128
We whispered the whole time!

12:37.163 --> 12:40.134
Well, there's only
one explanation, isn't there?

12:40.166 --> 12:42.167
One of you, in this room...

12:42.168 --> 12:44.569
in this sacred fort...

12:44.603 --> 12:45.637
is a rat!

12:48.941 --> 12:50.608
Oh, yeah! Yeah, yeah,
yeah. One of you is.

12:50.609 --> 12:52.911
- Can you just tell me who it is?
- No.

12:52.912 --> 12:54.312
Millie!

12:59.105 --> 13:02.508
So, which one of you is the rat?

13:02.542 --> 13:04.310
Tina, this is
your last Halloween ever.

13:04.344 --> 13:06.478
You ratted us out to Millie

13:06.479 --> 13:08.647
so we'd never have to leave,
didn't you?

13:08.682 --> 13:10.616
What? I-I want to get out
more than anyone.

13:10.617 --> 13:13.052
My childhood is slipping
through my candy-less fingers.

13:13.053 --> 13:14.954
Maybe Gene's the rat.

13:14.955 --> 13:18.172
Oh, please, let's just calm down
and take a spray paint nap.

13:18.191 --> 13:20.359
Darryl, why are you wearing
your backpack?

13:20.393 --> 13:21.694
Um...

13:21.728 --> 13:23.796
Why are you wearing
your backpack, Darryl?

13:23.797 --> 13:25.097
Answer the question.

13:25.131 --> 13:26.632
I just want to make sure
I don't lose it.

13:26.666 --> 13:28.300
Oh, really?
You don't want to lose it?

13:28.301 --> 13:30.169
Because you think
you're getting out of here?

13:30.203 --> 13:31.770
I am!
Millie, let me out of here!

13:31.805 --> 13:33.172
I did my part,
you do yours!

13:33.173 --> 13:34.707
She's not letting
you out, Darryl.

13:34.708 --> 13:37.042
You fool! Why would you do this?

13:37.077 --> 13:39.044
I'm weak, Louise.

13:39.045 --> 13:40.446
I'm weak.

13:40.480 --> 13:41.614
<i>"Dear Millie, I need candy.</i>

13:41.648 --> 13:43.716
<i>"Also I will need to poo soon.</i>

13:43.717 --> 13:44.884
<i>Please let me out."</i>

13:44.918 --> 13:45.985
<i>"Dear Darryl,</i>

13:46.019 --> 13:47.519
<i>"Help me help you poo.</i>

13:47.554 --> 13:49.355
<i>"Be my man on the inside.</i>

13:49.356 --> 13:50.890
<i>Love, Millie."</i>

13:50.924 --> 13:53.416
I couldn't let
the Treasure Trail go to waste!

13:53.426 --> 13:55.694
If you hadn't told her
about our escape plan,

13:55.729 --> 13:57.863
we could have used
our plan to escape!

13:57.898 --> 14:00.866
Oh, that's so obvious now,
isn't it?

14:00.867 --> 14:03.569
I'm sorry it's hard for me to
think when my pants are off.

14:03.570 --> 14:05.537
I just want candy!

14:05.572 --> 14:07.373
All right, all right.
It's okay, Darryl.

14:07.407 --> 14:09.341
You didn't know
what you were doing.

14:09.342 --> 14:10.542
Huh, buddy?
No.

14:10.577 --> 14:12.511
My pants are off.
Yeah.

14:12.512 --> 14:16.181
So, what do we do with a snitch?

14:16.182 --> 14:18.684
You did the crime,
now you do the time.

14:18.685 --> 14:19.752
Andy and Ollie...

14:19.753 --> 14:20.753
Burp 'n Blow.

14:23.189 --> 14:24.256
Poor bastard.

14:24.257 --> 14:25.557
That smells nice.

14:25.558 --> 14:26.558
You guys eat sherbet?

14:26.559 --> 14:27.559
Cucumber soap.

14:27.560 --> 14:28.928
I ate a flower.

14:28.929 --> 14:30.229
This is the one day
you don't eat

14:30.230 --> 14:31.730
peanut butter
and tuna for lunch?

14:31.731 --> 14:34.099
You ruined Burp n' Blow torture!

14:34.134 --> 14:35.534
It's pretty bad.

14:35.535 --> 14:37.770
It's not. It's fun.
It's festive.

14:37.804 --> 14:39.238
- No.
- It looks like it's from China.

14:39.239 --> 14:41.807
No, China would be furious
about this dragon.

14:41.808 --> 14:43.375
They love dragons there.

14:43.410 --> 14:44.810
Hey, where are the kids?

14:44.811 --> 14:45.978
They should've been home by now.

14:45.979 --> 14:47.046
Oh, my God, they're lost!

14:47.047 --> 14:48.113
Not on Halloween!

14:48.114 --> 14:49.715
Lin, easy.
They're dead.

14:49.716 --> 14:50.716
- No, they're not dead.
- They're dead.

14:50.717 --> 14:52.084
No, I know it, they're dead.

14:52.085 --> 14:54.119
No, I bet they're
in that fort they built.

14:54.120 --> 14:56.221
21Oh, yeah.
Ugh, that fort.

14:56.222 --> 14:57.790
Well, it is pretty cool
once you get inside.

14:57.791 --> 15:00.125
What do you mean inside?
They let you in?

15:00.126 --> 15:02.728
- I thought we weren't allowed.
- I wasn't supposed to say anything.

15:02.729 --> 15:04.463
But it's great.
Why can't I go in?

15:04.464 --> 15:05.764
I-I don't know, I...

15:05.765 --> 15:07.132
And there's a ton
of rules they have,

15:07.133 --> 15:08.834
so... I guess...
that was one of them.

15:08.835 --> 15:10.569
Right, right,
right, whatever.

15:10.570 --> 15:11.971
We're gonna go to that
fort and we're getting

15:11.972 --> 15:13.605
those little should-be
trick-or-treaters

15:13.606 --> 15:15.414
and we're shoving them
inside this thing.

15:15.442 --> 15:17.242
Hey, you guys, I was
just trick-or-treating!

15:17.243 --> 15:18.334
Mmm, this candy's so good.

15:18.345 --> 15:20.946
Oops, I dropped some.

15:20.981 --> 15:22.948
Good thing there's more
where that came from.

15:22.949 --> 15:24.316
You monster!

15:24.317 --> 15:26.652
You can't do this to us!

15:26.686 --> 15:29.588
- Uh, it's just down here.
- Yeah, I know where it is,

15:29.622 --> 15:31.156
Mr. I've Been In The Fort
Before And You Haven't.

15:31.157 --> 15:32.624
That's right, I have.

15:32.625 --> 15:34.159
They were inside my
fort for a long time.

15:34.160 --> 15:35.494
That's the original fort.

15:35.495 --> 15:36.495
Bob and Linda.

15:36.496 --> 15:37.629
Uh...?
Huh.

15:37.664 --> 15:39.264
Millie Frock.
Louise's friend?

15:39.265 --> 15:40.532
Hey, you know,
I just ran into

15:40.533 --> 15:42.334
Louise and Gene and Tina
trick-or-treating.

15:42.369 --> 15:44.603
- What?
- They're trick-or-treating without their costume?

15:44.604 --> 15:45.871
We've been slaving
away all day!

15:45.872 --> 15:47.940
Where? Where are they?

15:47.941 --> 15:49.975
I don't know the name of the
street, 'cause I'm a little kid.

15:49.976 --> 15:51.643
But if you follow me,
I can show you.

15:51.678 --> 15:53.445
Skip like this.

15:53.446 --> 15:54.480
I don't want to skip.

15:54.481 --> 15:55.647
I said skip!

15:55.682 --> 15:57.149
Who is this kid?
I like her.

15:57.150 --> 15:58.150
She's fun.

16:00.687 --> 16:02.454
So last year was
my last Halloween

16:02.455 --> 16:03.555
and I didn't even know it.

16:03.556 --> 16:04.957
I wish I could
go back in time

16:04.958 --> 16:06.792
and tell myself
to enjoy it more.

16:06.793 --> 16:08.627
And also, not to go
into this fort.

16:08.628 --> 16:10.662
I wish I could go
back ten seconds ago

16:10.663 --> 16:12.131
before I ate cardboard.

16:12.132 --> 16:13.899
Uh-oh, I'm doing it again.

16:13.900 --> 16:14.933
Hmm.

16:14.968 --> 16:16.869
Wait.

16:16.903 --> 16:18.404
Guys, take a look at this.

16:18.405 --> 16:19.854
What is it, rat?

16:19.873 --> 16:21.273
You see those
buttons on the truck?

16:21.307 --> 16:22.975
Yeah.
We just have to find a way

16:22.976 --> 16:25.277
to hit the "up" button
and boom, the roof is lifted.

16:25.278 --> 16:27.379
And how exactly are we going
to hit the button, huh?

16:27.380 --> 16:28.614
You gonna snitch on it?

16:28.615 --> 16:31.350
No, we use this.

16:31.384 --> 16:33.685
Darryl,,
you're my favorite kind of rat.

16:33.686 --> 16:35.369
A rat with a hanger.

16:35.388 --> 16:37.189
Where'd she go?

16:37.223 --> 16:38.891
Whew, she's a fast skipper.

16:38.892 --> 16:40.159
So where are the kids?

16:40.193 --> 16:41.493
I don't see them anywhere.

16:41.494 --> 16:43.062
I'll tell you
where they are.

16:43.063 --> 16:45.064
Not wearing their costume
on Ungrateful Avenue.

16:45.065 --> 16:47.332
- Jerks.
- We worked so hard on this thing.

16:47.333 --> 16:49.368
I fought the people
at the art supply store.

16:49.369 --> 16:50.869
All that glue in my hair.

16:50.870 --> 16:53.772
- I hate to see it go to waste.
- Yeah.

16:54.908 --> 16:56.708
Trick or treat!

16:56.709 --> 16:58.811
Oh, uh...
what are you supposed to be?

16:58.845 --> 17:00.646
It's a dragon, duh.

17:00.680 --> 17:03.215
It doesn't look like any
dragon I've ever seen before.

17:03.249 --> 17:04.348
Yeah, well,
your doo's spid.

17:04.349 --> 17:06.018
Yeah.
Yeah.

17:06.019 --> 17:08.353
Aren't you a little bit old
to be trick or treating?

17:08.354 --> 17:10.689
You're old.
You're probably 60.

17:10.690 --> 17:12.191
I am 60... Hey!

17:12.224 --> 17:13.531
We gonna get any candy or not?

17:13.560 --> 17:15.094
No!
You have to give it.

17:15.095 --> 17:16.361
Bob?
No.

17:16.362 --> 17:17.863
Is that you?
No. What? Who's...?

17:17.896 --> 17:19.364
Bob. From the burger place.

17:19.365 --> 17:20.965
No. No way. I'm not...

17:20.967 --> 17:22.367
I'd recognize you anywhere.
I'm nine.

17:22.367 --> 17:24.036
That is hilarious.
It's still not me.

17:24.037 --> 17:26.438
It's not me.
That is hilarious.

17:26.473 --> 17:28.406
- Honey, come. It's Bob. From the burger place.
- I can't... We can't stay.

17:28.407 --> 17:30.109
Just stay-stay there
Stay there. Stay there.

17:30.110 --> 17:31.977
- I can't. We actually have to go.
- It's great.

17:31.978 --> 17:33.479
- It's great. It's Bob and Linda.
- Bob, could you...?

17:33.480 --> 17:35.314
- That's not... From the burger place.
- Nah.

17:35.315 --> 17:37.216
Honey, they're pulling some
sort of... I don't know

17:37.217 --> 17:39.051
- it's a prank or...
- Dave, I can't stay, I'm sorry.

17:39.052 --> 17:40.385
Ah, hi...
But good to see you.

17:40.386 --> 17:41.936
Steady...

17:41.955 --> 17:43.689
- steady...
- I can't watch.

17:43.723 --> 17:45.424
Mostly because I can't see.

17:45.425 --> 17:46.825
You hear that? It's working!

17:47.994 --> 17:50.129
Uh...

17:51.965 --> 17:54.066
You hit the wrong button!
Turn it off!

17:54.100 --> 17:56.450
- Turn it off!
- I can't! The hanger's stuck!

17:57.770 --> 17:59.238
Aah!

18:01.474 --> 18:02.808
We're all gonna die!

18:02.809 --> 18:04.009
Every meal I've ever eaten

18:04.010 --> 18:05.677
is flashing before my eyes!

18:05.678 --> 18:07.679
Oh, my god, my last
meal was cardboard.

18:12.783 --> 18:14.651
This is not good
for my claustrophobia!

18:14.685 --> 18:15.685
Wait, there's garbage.

18:15.686 --> 18:17.186
We could use it,
we could stack it.

18:17.221 --> 18:18.788
Yes! Stack the strong stuff.

18:18.789 --> 18:20.790
Maybe we can stop this
thing from crushing us.

18:20.791 --> 18:22.768
Ollie, Andy, get in there!

18:29.900 --> 18:32.445
It's working!
Isn't it?

18:36.573 --> 18:38.374
Yes!

18:38.409 --> 18:39.618
The door! It's open!

18:39.643 --> 18:41.878
- Crawl to freedom!
- Crawl to Halloween!

18:41.912 --> 18:43.446
Crawl to candy!

18:43.447 --> 18:45.291
My shoe!

18:45.316 --> 18:47.383
Now our shoes will be together!

18:49.253 --> 18:50.386
Whoa!

18:50.387 --> 18:52.465
We did it!
We're alive!

18:52.489 --> 18:54.324
Whew, we've still got a few
minutes left on the candy clock.

18:54.325 --> 18:55.625
What about our costume?

18:55.626 --> 18:57.327
Screw the costume.
There's no time!

18:57.328 --> 18:58.995
We only got a few minutes
left on the candy clock!

18:58.996 --> 19:01.130
Did you not hear me?
But nobody will give us candy

19:01.131 --> 19:02.265
if we're not wearing one.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.067
Congratulations.

19:04.068 --> 19:05.835
You're a robot.
Hold on, candy!

19:05.836 --> 19:08.271
I'm coming for you!
Yeah!

19:10.074 --> 19:11.151
Treasure Trail...

19:11.152 --> 19:13.976
lead us to treasure.

19:13.977 --> 19:15.488
Oh, come on!

19:15.512 --> 19:16.679
No! No!

19:16.680 --> 19:18.114
Turn them on!
Turn them on!

19:18.115 --> 19:19.248
We're still here!

19:19.249 --> 19:21.084
Don't you go off on me!

19:22.519 --> 19:24.787
Aha! There you are.

19:24.788 --> 19:26.689
You think you're too
good for your costume?

19:26.690 --> 19:27.857
For us?

19:27.858 --> 19:29.759
Costume?
What am I even looking at?

19:29.760 --> 19:31.094
Godzilla's ding-dong?

19:31.128 --> 19:32.338
It's a dragon, Gene.

19:32.363 --> 19:34.097
It's not a dragon.
Yes, it is.

19:34.098 --> 19:36.199
You asked to us to make
you a dragon, we did.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.767
Wh-what are you?
Bean can head?

19:37.768 --> 19:38.935
Yeah.
No.

19:38.936 --> 19:41.037
Robot bean can head to you.
Oh.

19:41.038 --> 19:43.539
Well, I bet we got more candy
than you did, so neh.

19:43.540 --> 19:45.142
Wait, where is your candy?

19:45.175 --> 19:47.443
- Long story.
- Actually, I could tell it pretty fast.

19:47.444 --> 19:49.345
Well, at least
we can have some of yours.

19:49.380 --> 19:51.447
Nah-uh, bean heads.
We get the candy.

19:51.448 --> 19:52.815
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

19:52.816 --> 19:54.517
No, we get the candy!
It's ours!

19:54.518 --> 19:55.785
We're eating it all right now.

19:55.786 --> 19:57.320
- Never!
- I want your candy! No!

19:57.321 --> 19:59.589
Get them!
Get out of our dragon!

19:59.623 --> 20:01.290
I thought I was done
with Halloween.

20:01.291 --> 20:02.859
But it turns out,
Halloween's not done with me.

20:02.860 --> 20:03.860
Aah!

20:03.861 --> 20:06.496
Get out of our dragon!

20:06.497 --> 20:09.542
Okay, Halloween's over.

20:09.566 --> 20:11.401
I'm gonna eat more candy
in front of you guys.

20:11.402 --> 20:13.770
But you can eat the mini boxes
of raisins I didn't want.

20:13.804 --> 20:16.423
You'll need your strength
to make it through the ni...

20:17.908 --> 20:19.642
Oh, my God, I killed them!

20:19.643 --> 20:21.177
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

20:21.178 --> 20:22.545
People are gonna be
so mad at me.

20:22.546 --> 20:23.913
I'm gonna have
to find a therapist.

20:23.914 --> 20:25.815
Oh, geez,
I hope I like my therapist.

20:25.816 --> 20:27.517
You definitely won't.

20:27.518 --> 20:28.584
Who said that?

20:28.585 --> 20:30.486
The ghosts of us!

20:30.521 --> 20:33.022
This is Gene's ghost! Aah!

20:33.023 --> 20:36.192
We don't appreciate
being killed!

20:36.193 --> 20:38.195
Boo. This is Tina's ghost.

20:38.228 --> 20:40.396
Oh, no.
Oh, I didn't mean to kill you.

20:40.397 --> 20:42.632
I was just gonna keep you
in there until you got old.

20:42.666 --> 20:45.635
Give us your candy, you nutcase.

20:45.669 --> 20:47.270
All of it? Or-or do you
just want some of it?

20:47.271 --> 20:48.471
Or do you want to trade?

20:48.505 --> 20:49.505
All of it!

20:49.506 --> 20:50.640
Here, take it!

20:52.443 --> 20:53.910
Happy Halloween.
Thanks for killing us.

20:53.911 --> 20:55.531
Heaven's nice.
