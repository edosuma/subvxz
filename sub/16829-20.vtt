WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:04.136
Paige, we need a final number
on those floral arrangements.

00:04.138 --> 00:06.038
They're not gonna arrange
themselves, right?

00:06.040 --> 00:08.140
I know. We're all pushing
the wedding ball forward.

00:08.142 --> 00:10.175
Dudes of honor working overtime.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.243
You are Toby's best ma'am

00:11.245 --> 00:12.511
for a reason.

00:12.512 --> 00:13.778
You whip those clowns
into shape.

00:13.781 --> 00:15.280
We've been looking
at venues all day.

00:15.282 --> 00:17.149
We can't do everything
ourselves.

00:17.151 --> 00:19.685
We will see you when we're done
with the madness on our end.

00:19.687 --> 00:22.688
They bought it.
Shh.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.457
I just crossed
from bliss to nirvana.

00:25.459 --> 00:28.027
I'm coming up on rapture.

00:28.029 --> 00:29.561
How's your experiment?

00:29.563 --> 00:30.729
Well...

00:30.731 --> 00:34.166
The mud has improved
the elasticity.

00:34.168 --> 00:36.668
But the cream
has conferred suppleness.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.404
It's a tough call.

00:38.406 --> 00:40.372
Only one thing
left to do.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.541
Keep testing.

00:45.046 --> 00:47.213
Dr. Curtis and Ms. Quinn,

00:47.214 --> 00:49.381
thank you for considering
Harbor Oaks as a wedding venue.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.517
We hope that you enjoyed
your complimentary spa session.

00:51.519 --> 00:53.552
We most certainly did.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.821
Could we have our gift bags now?

00:59.060 --> 01:01.260
All right.

01:01.262 --> 01:03.729
Okay. I got aromatherapy.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.164
Facial emulsion.

01:05.166 --> 01:07.466
(gasps)
Lavender exfoliant.

01:07.468 --> 01:08.600
You can have mine.

01:08.602 --> 01:10.402
But...

01:10.404 --> 01:12.304
I'm keeping these.

01:12.306 --> 01:15.641
Stainless steel nail files,
hard as granite.

01:15.643 --> 01:17.676
I could use them to
smooth out rivets.

01:17.678 --> 01:21.213
The others can never know
what's going on here.

01:21.215 --> 01:23.749
What do I look like?
An idiot?

01:23.751 --> 01:25.317
Okay, thanks.

01:25.319 --> 01:27.086
(sighs)

01:27.088 --> 01:29.655
Spent the past hour on the phone
with bakeries.

01:29.657 --> 01:31.623
Toby insists on a spumoni
flavored cake,

01:31.625 --> 01:34.560
but Happy wants it in the shape
of a power train control module.

01:34.562 --> 01:36.095
Whatever the hell that is.

01:36.097 --> 01:37.696
Well, you better figure
that out.

01:37.698 --> 01:41.200
I asked Happy if Toby could
consider a few less guests.

01:41.202 --> 01:42.468
She nurpled me.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.787
We begged them to let us help.

01:44.788 --> 01:47.105
The truth is, they're probably
working twice as hard as we are.

01:47.108 --> 01:49.775
(groans) If I never have to have
another morning like that again,

01:49.777 --> 01:51.376
it will be too soon.

01:51.378 --> 01:52.678
How many places did you see?

01:52.680 --> 01:55.314
Too many to count.
It was a total nightmare.

01:55.316 --> 01:56.381
CABE:
Well, thanks to me,

01:56.383 --> 01:58.383
your slog of vetting venues
is over.

01:58.385 --> 02:01.787
The Lighthouse at Loma Buena
Coast Guard Station.

02:01.789 --> 02:05.257
Beautiful grounds,
amazing views.

02:05.259 --> 02:07.326
The only cost:
permits and cleanup.

02:07.328 --> 02:09.261
Love it.
Someone call a doctor,

02:09.263 --> 02:10.662
'cause my heart
just skipped a beat.

02:10.664 --> 02:14.466
And, as for seating,
as you can tell,

02:14.468 --> 02:17.569
I have used geometry
to place the tables

02:17.571 --> 02:19.671
for optimal traffic flow

02:19.673 --> 02:22.441
to get between the buffet, the
dance floor, and the bathrooms.

02:22.443 --> 02:24.776
Sweet.
And what do you have, 197?

02:24.778 --> 02:26.278
Something very special.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.813
Now, according to my research,

02:27.815 --> 02:30.682
your marriage only has
a 47% chance of succeeding.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.684
PAIGE:
Are you kidding me?

02:32.686 --> 02:35.554
No. The divorce rate
is 53%; it's simple math.

02:35.556 --> 02:37.356
So in the week leading up
to your wedding,

02:37.358 --> 02:39.591
I've lined up
a series of talks.

02:39.593 --> 02:43.762
Now, the first is an economist
to discuss comingling assets.

02:43.764 --> 02:45.764
The second is
a professional arbiter,

02:45.766 --> 02:47.833
to offer tips on dealing
with marriage spats.

02:47.835 --> 02:50.602
And then the final lecture is...

02:51.705 --> 02:53.639
a family planning expert.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.776
This is totally inappropriate.

02:57.778 --> 03:02.314
Walter, weddings are about love
and magic and hope.

03:02.316 --> 03:05.617
Mm-hmm. Well, I'd<i> love</i> to hope
that they buck the trend,

03:05.619 --> 03:07.186
but the best approach
is preparation.

03:07.188 --> 03:08.687
And magic is nonsense.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.222
(phone rings)

03:10.224 --> 03:11.223
Oh.

03:11.225 --> 03:12.457
Excuse me.

03:13.394 --> 03:14.626
Hey, Paige.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.929
This is your next duty
as best ma'am.

03:16.931 --> 03:18.697
We can't have him mucking up
our romance

03:18.699 --> 03:20.699
with probability and statistics.

03:20.701 --> 03:23.335
I know. It's like he has
no concept of what a wedding

03:23.337 --> 03:24.803
is supposed to... (sniffs)

03:24.805 --> 03:26.205
Are you wearing perfume?

03:26.207 --> 03:28.540
What? Me? No.
That-That's ridiculous.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.309
Why does it smell
like lavender?
Beats me.

03:30.311 --> 03:31.510
I don't smell anything.

03:31.512 --> 03:34.213
Who is up for
a six-figure payday

03:34.215 --> 03:35.447
to pluck a rocket
out of the air

03:35.449 --> 03:37.433
in the Hechnian Republic?

03:37.434 --> 03:39.418
We'd have to come up with
a solution in 24 hours.

03:40.354 --> 03:41.620
Weddings are expensive.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.755
You had me at six figures.

03:43.757 --> 03:46.525
Now, the Hechnian
reentry capsule

03:46.527 --> 03:48.794
suffered computer failure
due to a solar flare.

03:48.796 --> 03:52.564
Now, it is carrying an asteroid
harvested by the Republic

03:52.566 --> 03:54.666
so it could be exploited
for its heavy metals.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.568
The problem is,
the capsule is gonna crash

03:56.570 --> 03:58.537
in about 20 hours, and with it,

03:58.539 --> 04:00.372
everything they've worked for
will be lost.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.274
I believe you mean
meteor, not asteroid.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.476
Nope. Meteors are asteroids
that pass through our atmosphere

04:04.478 --> 04:07.246
prior to impact with the earth.
But this asteroid

04:07.248 --> 04:09.265
is in a protective capsule

04:09.266 --> 04:11.283
to prevent it from burning up
during atmospheric passage.

04:11.285 --> 04:14.653
So it lands in a pristine
asteroid-like state.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.288
Hence, not a meteor.

04:16.290 --> 04:17.756
It still passed through
the atmosphere,

04:17.758 --> 04:19.324
so, by definition,

04:19.326 --> 04:20.959
it's a meteor
in an asteroidal state.

04:20.961 --> 04:23.562
I'm gonna kick both of you
in your asteroidal states

04:23.564 --> 04:24.963
if you don't drop it.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.732
Now, why's this rock
so important?

04:26.734 --> 04:28.400
It's rich in the
element palladium.

04:28.402 --> 04:31.036
Ooh. Palladium has countless
industrial applications.

04:31.038 --> 04:34.573
Most common use
is in catalytic converters

04:34.575 --> 04:35.774
in car exhaust systems.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.009
To the auto industry alone,

04:37.011 --> 04:38.844
a cache of palladium
is worth a fortune.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.579
That's why
the Hechnian president

04:40.581 --> 04:41.880
built their space program.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.549
According to this
Homeland report,

04:44.551 --> 04:46.485
he's an Oxford trained scientist

04:46.486 --> 04:48.420
who gambled every penny
of their national economy

04:48.422 --> 04:52.424
on being first to corner the
market on space harvesting.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.293
Well, it makes sense.
The superpowers are too big

04:54.295 --> 04:55.661
to care about such things,

04:55.663 --> 04:57.429
smaller nations
can't pull it off.

04:57.431 --> 04:59.464
Hechnian Republic
is in the sweet spot.

04:59.466 --> 05:02.567
They can triple their GNP
with just one industry.

05:02.569 --> 05:03.969
Not if the capsule crashes

05:03.971 --> 05:06.305
and the asteroid is destroyed.
Meteor.

05:06.307 --> 05:08.974
I know this is a private gig
and I'm not involved,

05:08.976 --> 05:10.976
but I got to ask, how the hell
are you gonna solve this?

05:10.978 --> 05:13.845
HAPPY:
I have an idea,
but it's crazy.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.547
Every Scorpion idea's crazy.

05:15.549 --> 05:17.916
You know how at the spa
you go from the sauna

05:17.918 --> 05:21.553
into a cold immersion tub
for rapid deceleration.

05:21.555 --> 05:22.821
Why would they know anything
about that?

05:22.823 --> 05:24.056
We don't know anything
about spas.

05:24.058 --> 05:25.457
Who goes to spas?

05:26.827 --> 05:30.595
The point is, we can use
a rapid deceleration

05:30.597 --> 05:31.596
to save this meteor.

05:31.598 --> 05:33.999
Asteroid.
Shut up. How?

05:34.001 --> 05:36.335
Walt codes software

05:36.337 --> 05:39.604
so we can remotely control
a military helicopter

05:39.606 --> 05:42.007
that will have a coupler arm
that I build attached to it.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.775
Be careful with that;
it's a limited edition.

05:43.777 --> 05:47.813
Why does Super Fun Guy have
a helicopter he can fly?

05:47.815 --> 05:50.482
It's for when he gets tired.
Focus.

05:50.484 --> 05:52.751
I assume you're suggesting
the helicopter ascends

05:52.753 --> 05:55.620
to an interception point
with the...

05:58.892 --> 06:00.659
...space rock

06:00.661 --> 06:03.495
and uses the coupler to attach
to the capsule.

06:03.497 --> 06:04.963
But won't the rock just smash
into the helicopter?

06:04.965 --> 06:07.099
And even if it doesn't,
how do we catch something

06:07.101 --> 06:08.834
that's falling from space
a million miles an hour?

06:08.836 --> 06:10.402
It will not smash

06:10.404 --> 06:13.839
because gravity will pull

06:13.841 --> 06:15.140
the capsule straight down.

06:15.142 --> 06:18.510
And it will only be moving
at 125 miles per hour,

06:18.512 --> 06:19.978
terminal velocity.

06:19.980 --> 06:23.582
So if we cut the helicopter's
power at the precise moment,

06:23.584 --> 06:26.451
it will free-fall
next to the capsule.

06:26.453 --> 06:28.086
While at identical
and parallel speeds,

06:28.088 --> 06:29.621
the copter will reach out

06:29.623 --> 06:32.557
with the coupler
and lock onto

06:32.559 --> 06:35.026
the capsule's docking mechanism.

06:35.028 --> 06:38.397
Then I will restart
the helicopter

06:38.399 --> 06:40.632
with maximum upward force
and reverse the fall

06:40.634 --> 06:42.934
and land it safely
at their air force base.

06:42.936 --> 06:45.704
This is crazier
than our normal crazy.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.005
It's sound science.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.408
I'm sure the Hechnian president
will love it.

06:49.410 --> 06:51.476
♪ ♪

06:53.514 --> 06:55.781
This plan has me terrified.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.816
I can assure you,
our numbers check out.

06:57.818 --> 07:01.153
Our nation's future is dependent
on our space harvesting program.

07:01.155 --> 07:05.424
If it fails, those responsible
will bear the cost.

07:05.426 --> 07:07.459
If you'll excuse me.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.963
Sounds like a threat.

07:11.965 --> 07:14.166
In our country,
the executive branch

07:14.168 --> 07:15.801
serves at the pleasure
of the military.

07:15.803 --> 07:18.103
President Korsovich

07:18.105 --> 07:19.938
was elected as one
of three candidates

07:19.940 --> 07:21.973
pre-approved by General Savic.

07:21.975 --> 07:25.444
It is an illusion of democracy.

07:25.446 --> 07:26.611
I pray, as our country advances,

07:26.613 --> 07:28.146
it will become more free,
like America.

07:28.148 --> 07:30.949
I hope, as a scientist,

07:30.951 --> 07:33.585
that our space program will be

07:33.587 --> 07:36.988
a great catalyst
for change in our nation.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.458
Well, you have nothing to fear.
You hired us for a reason.

07:39.460 --> 07:41.927
We're consummate professionals;
we're the best at what we do.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.094
We're done.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.363
Tough putting
that thing on, though.

07:45.364 --> 07:47.631
I built the bottom hinge
from a washing machine lid.

07:49.736 --> 07:52.003
Consummate professionals.

07:52.005 --> 07:55.774
Calculating interception
altitude at 5,273 feet.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.509
Copy that. Happy.

08:01.748 --> 08:03.215
TOBY:
Wind velocity

08:03.217 --> 08:05.183
112 knots south southwest.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.719
WALTER:
Add 176 feet of altitude.

08:07.721 --> 08:11.089
Inputting intercept coordinates
to seven significant digits.

08:11.091 --> 08:13.558
Coupler's ready to go.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.961
Software's coordinated the exact
time to 1/100 of a second,

08:15.963 --> 08:18.830
so when you hear the beep,
kill the helicopter engines.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.074
(beeping)

08:29.076 --> 08:30.141
HAPPY:
It's in free fall.

08:30.143 --> 08:32.143
Capsule's closing fast.

08:37.084 --> 08:38.717
Velocity matched perfectly.

08:38.719 --> 08:39.784
Extending coupler.

08:45.292 --> 08:46.525
Okay. We're connected.

08:46.527 --> 08:47.993
Yes.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.195
Unbelievable.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.663
Restart the helicopter

08:51.665 --> 08:52.964
and land the
cargo safely.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.933
(alarm beeps)

08:54.935 --> 08:57.135
TOBY: Happy!
HAPPY: Uh...

08:57.137 --> 08:58.937
A bit of an issue.
The ignition is not responding.

08:58.939 --> 09:01.106
What do you mean
"not responding"? Fix it.

09:01.108 --> 09:04.142
I would if I could, but there's
no response to my remote signal.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.710
We've got a bigger problem.
Force of coupling

09:05.712 --> 09:07.579
knocked our objects
four degrees off course.

09:07.581 --> 09:09.981
What?
Impact will be in the heart
of your capital city

09:09.983 --> 09:11.216
three miles away.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.884
Thousands of people
will be killed.

09:17.024 --> 09:18.557
Save my capsule!

09:18.559 --> 09:19.958
I already told you, I
cannot make this bird fly.

09:19.960 --> 09:23.695
Screaming at me doesn't--
Wait, wait.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.737
(monitor beeping)

09:39.780 --> 09:40.879
There we go.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.948
I just needed
new batteries.

09:43.850 --> 09:45.951
Sorry. The remote
was originally used

09:45.953 --> 09:47.986
for Sly's bird drone.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.120
Haven't used it in a while.

09:49.122 --> 09:51.756
His name was Birdroni.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.262
Amazing. This was
just in space.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.130
Let's move it quickly
into the main hangar.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.800
We have the press coming
to see our accomplishments.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.201
Hold on a sec, General.

10:03.203 --> 10:06.137
There's a slight bluish
discoloration to this thing.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.706
It's shiny.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.841
Let's clean it before the press
takes pictures.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.309
Well, I know you're an eager
beaver, Ivan,

10:11.311 --> 10:12.978
but you're about
to tell millions

10:12.980 --> 10:15.714
that you mined the galaxy for
an incredibly valuable element.

10:15.716 --> 10:16.748
Don't you want me
to make sure you have

10:16.750 --> 10:17.983
what you think you have here?

10:17.985 --> 10:19.217
It's a two-minute procedure.

10:19.219 --> 10:20.318
I just take
a microscopic sample

10:20.320 --> 10:21.886
from the capsule's test port.

10:21.888 --> 10:23.121
It's like a biopsy.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.123
It could be worth more
than you realize.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.892
Do it quickly.

10:27.894 --> 10:29.027
PAIGE:
Uh, Walt, moment?

10:29.029 --> 10:31.062
I know you were trying

10:31.064 --> 10:34.132
to help when you were
booking those lecturers...

10:34.134 --> 10:35.367
But you think it's a bad idea.

10:35.369 --> 10:38.236
Absolutely terrible idea.

10:40.173 --> 10:43.808
Weddings are about the
joining of two people

10:43.810 --> 10:45.377
to a bond that-that's...

10:45.379 --> 10:47.712
its own amazing thing.

10:47.714 --> 10:50.415
Understood.
Really?

10:50.417 --> 10:52.083
No, but if it makes you
feel better,

10:52.085 --> 10:53.418
I will cancel the lectures.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.787
Now I just need to focus
on finding their wedding song.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.956
Wait. What?

10:57.958 --> 11:00.258
Uh, the bride and
groom pick their song.

11:00.260 --> 11:03.662
Well, Toby and Happy
couldn't decide on one,

11:03.664 --> 11:06.765
so I designed a program
that studies the melody,

11:06.767 --> 11:09.768
structure and lyrics
of thousands of love songs

11:09.770 --> 11:12.003
to find the mathematically
perfect one.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.673
Mathematically
perfect love song?

11:14.675 --> 11:16.107
It'll be the hit
of the wedding.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.048
Gallo.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.215
Good news. We're heading home.

11:24.217 --> 11:25.950
Big success.
I'll fill you in later.

11:25.952 --> 11:28.053
Oh, well, I'm glad to hear that.

11:28.055 --> 11:29.387
Sitting here
going over tablecloths

11:29.389 --> 11:31.022
for the nuptials. I got

11:31.024 --> 11:33.091
ivory, snowflake and eggshell.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.426
I mean, they're all white.

11:34.428 --> 11:35.927
I swear, when I get back,

11:35.929 --> 11:37.829
I'm taking over this wedding
from you guys.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.164
(door closes)
I got to go, kiddo.

11:39.166 --> 11:42.067
Allie.

11:42.069 --> 11:43.802
What a surprise.

11:43.804 --> 11:46.104
Hello, Cabe.

11:46.106 --> 11:48.106
I'm sure you're busy,
but I have something,

11:48.108 --> 11:49.708
and I thought
you should know.

11:49.710 --> 11:51.843
It affects Sylvester.

11:53.246 --> 11:58.249
This is video proof
that Patel accepted bribes

11:58.251 --> 12:00.018
from a big box
store in exchange

12:00.020 --> 12:01.853
for his vote on the
eminent domain bill.

12:01.855 --> 12:04.989
The bill that would have
demolished The Warlock's Chest.

12:04.991 --> 12:07.892
I knew Patel was a snake.

12:07.893 --> 12:10.794
I agree, so I'm delivering this
to the<i> West Altadenia Shopper.</i>

12:10.797 --> 12:12.397
The news should be in
tomorrow morning's edition.

12:12.399 --> 12:15.800
And Patel should be out of
office by tomorrow afternoon.

12:15.802 --> 12:17.736
How does that affect Sly?

12:17.738 --> 12:19.871
When an alderman is stripped
of his position,

12:19.873 --> 12:22.273
the next leading vote-getter
ascends,

12:22.275 --> 12:25.110
meaning Sylvester, if he wants,

12:25.112 --> 12:28.446
could be sworn in as soon
as day after tomorrow.

12:28.448 --> 12:32.016
Thank you for doing this.

12:32.018 --> 12:36.821
Okay. Well, you should download
a copy for your records.

12:36.823 --> 12:39.224
It's a great idea, but

12:39.226 --> 12:42.026
I don't know where
this thing goes.

12:42.028 --> 12:44.129
Would you like some help?

12:47.434 --> 12:51.369
Sure, yeah.
I'd appreciate that.

13:01.081 --> 13:03.414
Uh, guys, guys, come here.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.984
What's wrong? I'm picking up
on me-levels of anxiety.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.352
I-I-I've finished
my analysis.

13:07.354 --> 13:09.454
There is lots of palladium,
but there's also DNA.

13:09.456 --> 13:12.357
There's millions of base
pairs of DNA, to be exact,

13:12.359 --> 13:14.559
and they are all
strung together.

13:14.561 --> 13:17.245
Are you saying we
found alien life?

13:17.246 --> 13:19.930
No. We found organized DNA.
There's just no cell membranes,

13:19.933 --> 13:22.066
so it's just short
of extraterrestrial life.

13:22.068 --> 13:24.369
This DNA could be prion,
it could be plasmid.

13:24.371 --> 13:26.104
PAIGE:
Amazing.

13:26.105 --> 13:27.838
So the rock's even more valuable
for the Hechnian people.

13:27.841 --> 13:29.207
It's not
amazing.

13:29.209 --> 13:30.441
It's potentially
very dangerous.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.510
Paige, we're dealing
with unknown pathogens.

13:32.512 --> 13:33.845
Very likely deadly pathogens

13:33.847 --> 13:35.547
that could wipe out life
in this country.

13:37.184 --> 13:39.017
Not good.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.085
♪ ♪

13:49.563 --> 13:50.746
SAVIC:
Pathogens?

13:50.747 --> 13:51.930
KORSOVICH:
I knew DNA and amino acids

13:51.932 --> 13:54.032
could be found
throughout the galaxy.

13:54.034 --> 13:55.934
Never expected I could
bring it back to Earth

13:55.936 --> 13:57.569
and endanger our people.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.203
Not just your people.
The whole world's at risk.

13:59.206 --> 14:00.438
We've never seen
these pathogens before

14:00.440 --> 14:02.307
because they've been
cruising the Milky Way

14:02.309 --> 14:03.441
for a billion years.

14:03.443 --> 14:05.343
But these can spread quickly.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.345
Imagine the most deadly,
communicable flu

14:07.347 --> 14:08.613
with no known cure.

14:08.615 --> 14:09.948
So what can be done?

14:09.950 --> 14:11.349
We need
to sterilize the asteroid.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.551
To do that, we need to
heat it to 3,000 degrees.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.954
At 3,000 degrees, palladium
turns to palladium oxide.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.956
Our whole endeavor
will be lost.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.608
Then we don't do it.

14:19.609 --> 14:21.259
We've spent too much money, too
much time to lose it all now.

14:21.261 --> 14:22.393
You don't have a choice.

14:22.395 --> 14:23.561
Once you open that capsule,

14:23.563 --> 14:24.996
you are exposing
everyone on this base,

14:24.998 --> 14:27.365
everyone in your country
to possible death.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.934
We paid you to retrieve
our capsule. That's all.

14:29.936 --> 14:31.369
It's not your concern.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.471
Like hell it isn't.
We're not gonna be responsible

14:33.473 --> 14:34.873
for potentially
millions of deaths.

14:34.875 --> 14:37.942
Not your decision to make.

14:37.944 --> 14:39.878
No, but it is mine.

14:39.880 --> 14:44.215
We will not risk the lives
of innocent people to save face.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.217
We will tell the press
and our nation

14:46.219 --> 14:50.355
that we have tried...
and failed.

14:50.357 --> 14:53.358
Don't forget
who made you president.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.526
I haven't.

14:55.528 --> 14:58.062
But I am president,
nonetheless.

15:01.268 --> 15:04.903
Team Scorpion, thank you
for your hard work today.

15:04.905 --> 15:08.139
My men will escort you
to your plane.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.015
Does anyone else think
it was weird how quickly

15:17.017 --> 15:19.083
they shuttled us off right after
we rock-blocked them?

15:19.085 --> 15:21.286
I found it strange.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.991
Walt, your, uh...
your shoe's untied there.

15:26.993 --> 15:28.593
WALTER:
Hmm?

15:28.595 --> 15:32.130
Oh, thank you.

15:32.132 --> 15:34.232
Would you look at that?
So is mine.

15:34.234 --> 15:37.702
I think the president and the
general are planning something,

15:37.704 --> 15:39.170
and I don't think

15:39.172 --> 15:41.339
sterilizing that rock is
on their to-do list.

15:41.341 --> 15:43.574
Oh, I dropped my contact!

15:45.111 --> 15:46.311
TOBY:
Sylvester.

15:46.313 --> 15:47.512
You wear glasses.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.180
One-- I'm not a good liar.

15:49.182 --> 15:51.516
Two-- the last thing
this earth needs is more germs.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.318
We can't let them expose
that asteroid.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.253
Meteor.
HAPPY: Uh, I dropped

15:55.255 --> 15:56.487
my pen.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.006
I'll help you look.

15:58.007 --> 15:59.524
HAPPY: Okay, we need
to figure something out

15:59.526 --> 16:01.025
because once we get
on that plane,

16:01.027 --> 16:02.593
we lose our chance
to stop this from happening.

16:02.595 --> 16:03.695
Well, we'd better
figure it out fast,

16:03.697 --> 16:05.063
because we all look like a bunch

16:05.065 --> 16:06.197
of hens eating chicken feed.

16:06.199 --> 16:08.099
I invite them to our country,

16:08.101 --> 16:10.568
pay them handsomely,
and this is how they repay us?

16:10.570 --> 16:13.004
I'll see to it they never
make it onto that plane.

16:13.006 --> 16:14.305
No. My office
will take care of it.

16:14.307 --> 16:17.342
Eerik, get your
service weapon.

16:21.081 --> 16:22.314
Okay, we're just a few miles

16:22.315 --> 16:23.548
from the base's airstrip.
We need a plan.

16:23.550 --> 16:25.083
The problem is,
they're not gonna let us

16:25.085 --> 16:26.150
anywhere near that rock.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.360
Uh, why are we pulling over?

16:35.362 --> 16:37.428
The president's attaché is here,
and he has a gun.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.764
Team Scorpion.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.099
Something tells me

16:41.101 --> 16:42.133
they're not here

16:42.135 --> 16:43.167
'cause we forgot
our parting gifts.

16:43.169 --> 16:45.303
Get out.

16:45.305 --> 16:48.206
Now!

16:49.175 --> 16:51.242
Come on.

16:54.781 --> 16:59.317
By order of the president,
return to the main hangar.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.252
Yes, sir.

17:01.254 --> 17:04.422
TOBY: Sir, I-I-I assure you
we have no intention

17:04.424 --> 17:06.391
of interfering with any plans
you have for your meteor.

17:06.393 --> 17:07.458
Asteroid.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.076
(exhales)

17:32.085 --> 17:34.085
Man, you really hate
those badges.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.290
(dialing)

17:39.292 --> 17:41.292
General.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.327
I've dispatched
of the Americans.

17:43.329 --> 17:45.463
I'll send a team to
dispose of the bodies.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.732
The badges
were bugged.

17:47.734 --> 17:51.736
We heard all you said
in the truck, including Savic.

17:52.772 --> 17:55.239
And he will kill you
before he lets you touch

17:55.241 --> 17:56.474
the contents of
that capsule.

17:56.476 --> 17:58.576
And then he will kill me

17:58.578 --> 18:00.211
and the president
for helping you.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.115
So we need
to work together carefully.

18:04.117 --> 18:05.349
Work together how?

18:05.351 --> 18:07.085
You're the geniuses.

18:07.087 --> 18:09.253
The president was hoping
you'd have a plan.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.522
Well, we can try
to come up with one.

18:11.524 --> 18:12.790
Where's the capsule now?

18:12.792 --> 18:15.793
West Campus,
the aeronautics hangar.

18:17.230 --> 18:18.396
I'll fill in Cabe.

18:20.366 --> 18:22.700
So they think you're dead?

18:22.702 --> 18:24.135
We'll be dead for real
if you can't

18:24.137 --> 18:25.303
get us out of this country.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.871
All right, you guys
figure out a way

18:26.873 --> 18:28.706
to scrub that rock,
and Homeland and I

18:28.708 --> 18:30.441
will come up
with an extraction plan.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.243
Put your comm in. We need you.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.812
This is where the capsule is.

18:34.814 --> 18:37.882
The specimen will be removed
at a ceremony in one hour.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.884
People there could be
immediately contaminated,

18:39.886 --> 18:41.452
and they'll be carriers
of that pathogen.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.587
Security?

18:42.589 --> 18:43.754
Most of the campus
are scientists

18:43.756 --> 18:45.156
who look a lot
like you guys.

18:45.158 --> 18:46.424
But the area around

18:46.426 --> 18:47.892
the hangar and the perimeter

18:47.894 --> 18:50.161
is crawling
with military guards.

18:50.163 --> 18:52.363
Many of them already saw you
when you landed the helicopter.

18:52.365 --> 18:53.831
What's that?

18:53.833 --> 18:55.800
This is the Aeronautical Testing
Wind Tunnel.

18:55.802 --> 18:58.169
That's our single point
of failure.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.538
Well, the-the wind tunnel
shares a wall

19:00.540 --> 19:01.772
with the aeronautics hangar.

19:01.774 --> 19:04.308
From inside the tunnel,
we can turn the capsule

19:04.310 --> 19:06.210
into an oven
to sterilize the asteroid

19:06.212 --> 19:08.679
without the general or anyone
in the hangar even knowing.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.214
Cabe, are you there?

19:10.216 --> 19:12.650
Just got off with Homeland.
We're putting together

19:12.652 --> 19:14.385
a way to get you guys
out of there.
Before that happens,

19:14.387 --> 19:16.154
I'm gonna need your help
with some delicate chemistry

19:16.156 --> 19:18.589
that has the potential
to be quite combustible.

19:18.591 --> 19:21.159
Now, you'll need
to perform precise work for us.

19:21.161 --> 19:22.927
I'll try, but measuring precise

19:22.929 --> 19:25.463
chemical formulas isn't
really my specialty.

19:25.465 --> 19:27.465
I can help.

19:27.467 --> 19:30.301
I use sensitive equipment
in Patel's geology lab

19:30.303 --> 19:31.536
all the time.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.104
Is that Allie?

19:33.105 --> 19:34.671
Uh, now's not a good time
to tell you this,

19:34.674 --> 19:36.641
but she stopped by
to say that Patel's

19:36.643 --> 19:39.443
on the outs, and Sly is alderman
if he wants it.

19:39.445 --> 19:42.380
Oh, uh, wow.
Normally I would take a moment

19:42.382 --> 19:45.416
to digest such news, but
right now all I want for us is

19:45.418 --> 19:47.785
to get to that wind tunnel
so we can fix this mess.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.554
I am lost. How do you plan

19:49.556 --> 19:53.224
to use the wind tunnel
to heat up the capsule?

19:54.294 --> 19:56.294
WALTER:
<i> As the president's attaché,</i>

19:56.296 --> 19:59.197
<i> you can easily get us</i>
<i> onto West Campus.</i>

19:59.199 --> 20:01.599
Coming through.
Coming through.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.909
<i> We'll set up in a secure lab.</i>

20:18.284 --> 20:22.753
<i> Happy will find what she can</i>
<i> to fabricate a blowtorch.</i>

20:22.755 --> 20:24.589
<i> Toby will optimize a vacuum.</i>

20:25.959 --> 20:27.758
<i> Paige will gather the tools</i>
<i> to make a hole</i>

20:27.760 --> 20:29.460
<i> in the wind tunnel wall.</i>

20:29.462 --> 20:31.996
<i> I will create</i>
<i> a fuel delivery system.</i>

20:31.998 --> 20:34.966
<i> Meanwhile, Eerik and Sly</i>
<i> will slip a comm</i>

20:34.968 --> 20:37.668
<i> to President Korsovich.</i>

20:39.472 --> 20:40.738
(elevator bell dings)

20:40.740 --> 20:43.874
<i> Then head back</i>
<i> to the mission control tent.</i>

20:43.876 --> 20:47.612
<i> Since the capsule's been</i>
<i> removed, no one will be there.</i>

20:48.748 --> 20:50.514
<i> Sly will plug</i>
<i> into the campus server</i>

20:50.516 --> 20:52.917
<i> and have a direct link</i>
<i> to all security cameras.</i>

20:55.655 --> 20:58.522
<i> Korsovich will ensure</i>
<i> the capsule is placed next</i>

20:58.524 --> 20:59.824
<i> to the wall shared</i>
<i> with the wind tunnel.</i>

20:59.826 --> 21:02.860
There, back against the wall,

21:02.862 --> 21:06.731
right beneath our
nation's military flag.

21:07.867 --> 21:10.301
Good idea.

21:10.303 --> 21:13.037
<i> While we get this done,</i>
<i> Allie and Cabe will test-run</i>

21:13.039 --> 21:15.640
<i> various chemical formulas</i>
<i> I've sent them to see</i>

21:15.642 --> 21:17.842
<i> which creates</i>
<i>the hottest-burning fuel source</i>

21:17.844 --> 21:20.745
<i> so we can burn</i>
<i> the asteroid sterile.</i>

21:20.747 --> 21:23.514
Add 10cc's of methanol courtesy
of this disinfectant.

21:23.516 --> 21:24.715
Uh, this next?
I think

21:24.717 --> 21:27.818
if you add that in,
we blow up the garage.

21:27.820 --> 21:30.354
I'll hold off, then.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.025
ALLIE:
<i> Add stain remover.</i>

21:34.027 --> 21:35.860
<i> And you'll need disinfectant.</i>

21:35.862 --> 21:37.328
CABE;
<i>Of all the recipes you gave us,</i>

21:37.330 --> 21:39.430
this one baked
the hottest cake.

21:39.432 --> 21:40.798
Think we're set.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.400
Good, 'cause we're running out
of time

21:42.402 --> 21:43.868
before they open
their capsule.

21:43.870 --> 21:47.071
Did you guys see
<i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers?</i>

21:47.073 --> 21:48.339
No.
People in the film

21:48.340 --> 21:49.606
walk amongst the body snatchers

21:49.609 --> 21:51.442
without being caught
by being emotionless.

21:51.444 --> 21:53.444
They just act like they belong.

21:53.446 --> 21:55.263
Understood.

21:55.264 --> 21:57.081
No military types
along the path.
WALTER: Perfect.

21:57.083 --> 21:58.616
Okay, this shouldn't take long.
So you and Paige

21:58.618 --> 22:00.484
need to synthesize
a chemical litmus test

22:00.486 --> 22:01.819
to make sure
that there are no DNA strands

22:01.821 --> 22:02.887
that survive the sterilization.

22:02.889 --> 22:04.055
Copy that.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.963
Okay.

22:12.965 --> 22:15.399
This brick will do fine.

22:15.401 --> 22:17.068
Would be a lot easier
if we could just walk

22:17.070 --> 22:19.020
into the wind tunnel.

22:19.021 --> 22:20.971
Eerik said the guards
are in front of this place.

22:20.973 --> 22:23.407
Intake vent on the roof
is the most efficient option.

22:23.409 --> 22:25.710
It'll be like a water slide
without the water.

22:25.712 --> 22:27.111
I've never been on one.

22:27.113 --> 22:28.546
You've never been
to the water park?

22:28.548 --> 22:30.081
No. I've never been on a slide.

22:30.083 --> 22:32.416
Just get up the ladder.

22:34.387 --> 22:36.053
(Walter shouting)

22:37.990 --> 22:40.124
(Happy groans)

22:40.126 --> 22:43.594
Slides are stupid.

22:43.596 --> 22:44.995
Okay, we're in.

22:44.997 --> 22:46.964
SYLVESTER:
Okay.

22:48.134 --> 22:51.535
Opening the directional baffles
so you can get through.

22:51.537 --> 22:53.104
They are razor sharp,

22:53.106 --> 22:56.607
designed to cut the wind into
smooth, unidirectional flow.

22:56.609 --> 22:59.477
Which means it could also cut
you into small,

22:59.479 --> 23:02.446
unidirectional pieces,
so be careful.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.816
(grunts)

23:13.893 --> 23:14.892
Give me
your hand.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.428
Yeah.

23:21.501 --> 23:23.167
Okay.

23:23.169 --> 23:27.571
I'm gonna use the
stud finder to locate

23:27.573 --> 23:30.941
where the capsule is pressed
against the tunnel wall.

23:30.943 --> 23:33.477
(beeps)

23:37.517 --> 23:38.949
Okay.

23:51.664 --> 23:54.532
(indistinct chatter)

23:54.534 --> 23:56.667
(scraping in distance)

23:59.505 --> 24:03.808
Maestro, play
something festive.

24:03.810 --> 24:06.143
(upbeat music playing)

24:09.515 --> 24:11.081
(gasps)
Bogeys!

24:11.083 --> 24:13.484
Two scientists are headed
towards the observation room!

24:13.486 --> 24:14.118
Hide.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.219
Hide where? It's a tunnel.

24:15.221 --> 24:16.554
Lock the door, Sly.

24:16.556 --> 24:18.122
It's not electronic. I can't.

24:18.124 --> 24:20.157
If you're caught
in there, you die.

24:30.837 --> 24:33.070
KORSOVICH: Doctor,
what are you doing?!
Mr. President,

24:33.072 --> 24:36.974
we wanted to compare the actual
re-entry wind resistance data

24:36.976 --> 24:40.211
to the experimental values
from the tunnel.

24:40.213 --> 24:43.881
I appreciate your dedication,
but now is not the time

24:43.883 --> 24:46.484
for work. It's a
time for celebration.

24:46.486 --> 24:47.918
I want the whole team
to be there.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.487
Hmm?

24:49.489 --> 24:51.222
Yes, sir.

24:56.529 --> 24:59.129
Nice work, Mr. President.
That was close!

25:00.700 --> 25:02.099
Think the brick softened up
that metal enough.

25:02.101 --> 25:04.034
Time to cut.

25:08.674 --> 25:11.509
(groans)
I'm almost ready here, guys!

25:11.511 --> 25:12.943
Lab had every ingredient
we needed

25:12.945 --> 25:15.513
except a good source of,
uh, phosphorous and nitrogen.

25:15.515 --> 25:17.848
I'm still searching.

25:17.850 --> 25:21.085
Whoa, check it out.

25:21.087 --> 25:22.253
You found what you need?

25:22.255 --> 25:24.688
No. It's an Eastern Bloc
knock-off

25:24.690 --> 25:25.689
of Dr. Shazz soda,

25:25.691 --> 25:27.525
Dr. Shizz.

25:27.527 --> 25:28.826
Focus.

25:28.828 --> 25:29.593
Right.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.296
(wings flapping, pigeons cooing)

25:32.298 --> 25:34.698
Got it!

25:38.604 --> 25:40.137
Oh, no.
Is that what I think it is?

25:40.139 --> 25:42.306
Yeah. Bird poop
is an excellent source

25:42.308 --> 25:44.208
of phosphorous and nitrogen.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.976
If there are still strands

25:45.978 --> 25:48.579
of organized DNA left
on our meteor after

25:48.581 --> 25:50.581
Walter sterilized it, this is
gonna make it glow orange.

25:50.583 --> 25:53.584
And we'll know that
it still isn't safe.

25:53.586 --> 25:54.652
We've used bat poop, bird poop.

25:54.654 --> 25:56.153
Is there anything crap can't do?

25:56.155 --> 25:58.222
(creaking)

25:59.725 --> 26:02.259
(whispering):
There's the capsule.

26:04.964 --> 26:06.730
Okay.

26:06.732 --> 26:08.699
(hissing)

26:08.701 --> 26:10.868
Homemade fuel flowing.

26:10.870 --> 26:12.102
(hissing)

26:20.146 --> 26:22.613
Sliding through
the sample port,

26:22.615 --> 26:24.782
right up against the meteor.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.083
Tight enough fit

26:26.085 --> 26:29.787
so no pathogens
can come out.

26:29.789 --> 26:31.255
It's working.

26:31.257 --> 26:32.656
All right, guys, be careful.

26:32.658 --> 26:34.241
Allie's test showed
that that fuel

26:34.242 --> 26:35.825
burns well in excess
of 3,000 degrees.

26:37.029 --> 26:38.128
Good. We'll be done sooner

26:38.130 --> 26:39.697
and can get the heck out
of here.

26:39.699 --> 26:41.932
To that end,
Homeland's got the Navy SEALs

26:41.934 --> 26:44.201
waiting for you on a red
fishing boat on Teegan Bay,

26:44.203 --> 26:46.136
30 miles west of the base.

26:46.138 --> 26:48.205
(whirring)

26:48.207 --> 26:50.674
(alarm blaring)

26:51.644 --> 26:54.645
Happy, the turbine's starting.

26:59.719 --> 27:02.052
♪ ♪
(faint whirring in distance)

27:06.826 --> 27:09.393
I believe it is time for you
to take the microphone.

27:09.395 --> 27:12.830
Speak to the people
of our republic.

27:12.832 --> 27:14.098
Yes.

27:14.100 --> 27:16.700
(clears throat)

27:16.702 --> 27:20.070
Turn up the volume
so all can hear.

27:24.243 --> 27:26.410
The flame must've set off
a heat sensor.

27:26.412 --> 27:28.646
I didn't know that this tunnel
had a heat sensor.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.849
Fire's out!

27:44.363 --> 27:47.297
Must think we're trying to run
a re-entry simulation.

27:47.299 --> 27:48.799
Well, just turn it off!

27:48.801 --> 27:50.434
It's not a desk fan.

27:50.436 --> 27:52.903
It's a 5,000-horsepower turbine.
It needs to go through

27:52.905 --> 27:54.905
a 15-minute cycle
to start slowing down.

27:54.907 --> 27:56.306
WALTER:
Hold on!

27:56.308 --> 27:58.876
HAPPY: It's too strong!
And getting stronger!

27:59.679 --> 28:01.345
(grunts)

28:01.347 --> 28:04.081
I can't hold on
much longer!

28:04.083 --> 28:05.416
(grunts)

28:07.053 --> 28:08.052
Oh, God.

28:08.054 --> 28:09.753
Are the baffles still open?!

28:12.992 --> 28:16.126
Yes!
CABE: Sly,
you got to close those things

28:16.128 --> 28:18.228
before they get julienned
like a couple potatoes.

28:19.365 --> 28:20.731
I'm trying.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.000
(beeping)

28:33.145 --> 28:35.212
(wind blowing)

28:39.452 --> 28:42.453
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

28:42.455 --> 28:44.321
(beeping)

28:44.323 --> 28:47.057
You did it. Baffles are closing.

28:47.059 --> 28:48.158
They're closing slowly
due to the wind pressure.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.159
Guys, just hold on

28:49.161 --> 28:51.729
a little bit longer.

28:57.269 --> 29:00.104
(shouting)

29:09.048 --> 29:10.848
They're alive!

29:10.850 --> 29:13.283
Oh... I can breathe now.

29:13.285 --> 29:14.418
Is it always like this
with you guys?

29:14.420 --> 29:15.953
We're not done yet.

29:15.955 --> 29:17.221
You guys got to get
through that wind

29:17.223 --> 29:19.289
and back to burning that stone.

29:19.291 --> 29:22.226
We're facing wind force
three times a Cat 5 hurricane!

29:22.228 --> 29:23.994
We can't move!

29:23.996 --> 29:25.763
All right, Happy,
use the claw on your hammer

29:25.765 --> 29:27.431
to pickaxe your way back
to the hole.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.133
I can't reach it!

29:30.069 --> 29:32.536
Savic does not give
long speeches.

29:32.538 --> 29:33.904
He will open that capsule
when he's done.

29:34.774 --> 29:36.473
I've got an idea!

29:40.980 --> 29:42.980
Nail files!

29:42.982 --> 29:44.948
(quietly):
Ixnay on the aspay.

29:51.824 --> 29:53.457
We can't keep a campfire lit
at Forestry Braves

29:53.459 --> 29:55.092
with a slight breeze.
How is she going to light

29:55.094 --> 29:56.994
a blowtorch again
in a wind tunnel?

29:56.996 --> 30:01.265
Sly, open up the baffles
to increase turbulent flow!

30:01.267 --> 30:03.367
To create an eddy
in the wind stream

30:03.369 --> 30:05.035
so Happy can light the torch.

30:05.037 --> 30:07.304
Only need to open
the mid-baffles,

30:07.306 --> 30:10.541
but the system's designed
as an all-or-non proposition.

30:10.543 --> 30:12.342
So can't remotely open just one.

30:12.344 --> 30:14.111
I'll do it manually!

30:18.083 --> 30:19.449
(shouts)

30:21.420 --> 30:23.453
(shouting)

30:23.455 --> 30:25.556
Ooh, that's the sound of a man
on the receiving end

30:25.558 --> 30:26.557
of a very painful cut.

30:29.562 --> 30:31.962
SYLVESTER:
Wind flow's changed.
Happy's standing.

30:33.199 --> 30:35.065
Got it!

30:37.069 --> 30:39.069
TOBY:
Okay, we're good to go.

30:39.071 --> 30:40.904
Now the only problem is,
how do we get the DNA goulash

30:40.906 --> 30:42.573
into the wind tunnel
with the wind still blowing?

30:42.575 --> 30:44.007
We can't wait
until it shuts down,

30:44.009 --> 30:46.176
and Savic's gonna open
that capsule any minute.

30:46.178 --> 30:47.878
But if you walk in there,
you'll be thrown up

30:47.880 --> 30:49.613
against that baffle with Walter.

30:51.617 --> 30:53.584
Where's the heat sensor
that turned the turbine on?

30:53.586 --> 30:55.185
Two feet away from the door
to the observation room.

30:55.187 --> 30:57.921
This Dr. Shizz has got
to be good for something.

30:57.923 --> 30:59.089
Grab that flask,

30:59.091 --> 31:00.290
put on this lab coat,

31:00.292 --> 31:01.558
follow me.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.360
SYLVESTER:
All clear.

31:03.362 --> 31:05.429
Everybody's at the ceremony.

31:10.636 --> 31:13.203
See, this light is here
for a reason--

31:13.205 --> 31:15.439
so insane people
do not open this door

31:15.441 --> 31:16.607
while the
turbine is on.

31:16.609 --> 31:18.342
So stand back while I open it.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.622
(beeping)

31:34.326 --> 31:35.325
Are you okay?

31:35.327 --> 31:36.593
Yeah. It's just a cut.

31:36.595 --> 31:38.095
Happy, where are we?

31:38.097 --> 31:39.997
Almost done heating
this sucker up.

31:42.067 --> 31:44.568
(applause)

31:44.570 --> 31:48.171
Now it is time for you to see

31:48.173 --> 31:51.108
what I have brought back
to our great land.

31:51.110 --> 31:53.944
Lieutenant, your men
may now open the capsule.

31:55.581 --> 31:58.348
(whirring)

32:00.486 --> 32:01.652
Hurry.

32:01.654 --> 32:03.220
They're opening
the capsule.

32:03.222 --> 32:05.923
Flask.

32:05.925 --> 32:07.991
(whirring)

32:11.997 --> 32:14.464
Just need
a small sample to test.

32:18.137 --> 32:19.670
No orange,
no orange.

32:19.672 --> 32:21.371
No orange.

32:23.676 --> 32:24.675
What is wrong with you?

32:24.677 --> 32:26.376
Uh, sorry, sir.

32:26.378 --> 32:28.078
The air inside
is hot as oven.

32:29.381 --> 32:31.081
Get down!

32:31.083 --> 32:33.483
No orange.

32:33.485 --> 32:35.085
We're good.

32:39.725 --> 32:41.692
It's just dust.

32:41.694 --> 32:44.428
The Americans!

32:44.430 --> 32:46.430
Guys, the gig is up.
Get out now.

32:46.432 --> 32:48.298
Mr. President,
you need to find us.

32:48.300 --> 32:49.499
We can get you out safely.

32:49.501 --> 32:51.368
KORSOVICH:
I have allies who will hide

32:51.370 --> 32:54.171
Eerik and me.
Hechnians are survivors.

32:54.173 --> 32:57.341
You take care
of your own team and be safe.

33:01.313 --> 33:02.579
Come on, come on,
get in!

33:02.581 --> 33:04.982
Let's go,
we got to go!

33:04.984 --> 33:08.285
The pass code to the unmanned
back gate. Godspeed.

33:12.658 --> 33:15.192
No one on our tail.
We're gonna make it.

33:15.194 --> 33:17.394
Just heard from the SEALs.
They're ready and waiting.

33:17.396 --> 33:19.763
We're 15 minutes away.
We're good.

33:19.765 --> 33:23.000
MAN: General Savic. Be advised
the president is in custody.

33:23.002 --> 33:24.501
He said he and Eerik
would be safe.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.436
He knew we wouldn't leave
if he was in danger.

33:26.438 --> 33:28.205
Guys, we can't just leave him
here. But it's not like

33:28.207 --> 33:30.073
we can take on an entire army.

33:30.075 --> 33:32.009
Not with our strength.

33:32.011 --> 33:33.510
But with our brains.

33:34.413 --> 33:36.313
Happy, turn the car around.

33:40.052 --> 33:41.518
Your trial

33:41.520 --> 33:43.453
will be in the morning,
so you'll be dead by sundown.

33:43.455 --> 33:44.654
As for Team Scorpion,

33:44.656 --> 33:46.723
I have men
at every train station,

33:46.725 --> 33:49.326
highway and port
in a 30-mile radius.

33:49.328 --> 33:50.694
They will be captured.

33:50.696 --> 33:53.764
General. The Americans
are at security gate.

33:57.703 --> 33:59.236
Hello.

33:59.238 --> 34:01.638
Your men currently have
their guns at our backs.

34:01.640 --> 34:03.640
But if you let us live,

34:03.642 --> 34:05.776
we can make sure the
U.S. doesn't shut down

34:05.778 --> 34:08.178
your entire space program.

34:08.180 --> 34:10.047
Homeland knows
what you're up to

34:10.049 --> 34:11.448
and they've informed
the White House.

34:13.118 --> 34:15.352
But you could give me
five minutes of your time

34:15.354 --> 34:17.254
and we could make a deal.

34:17.256 --> 34:18.455
It could make you
very, very rich.

34:23.762 --> 34:27.297
Let me begin by saying
you have a lovely country.

34:27.299 --> 34:28.765
Your five minutes
is running.

34:28.767 --> 34:29.766
Get to the point, Sly.

34:29.768 --> 34:32.502
Right, the point.

34:32.504 --> 34:33.837
This is what is left
of your meteor.

34:33.839 --> 34:36.239
Asteroid.
Seriously? Now?

34:38.577 --> 34:39.810
I am a germophobe;

34:39.812 --> 34:41.511
I would never put my hand
in something

34:41.513 --> 34:43.146
if it was contaminated.

34:44.850 --> 34:46.616
We rendered

34:46.618 --> 34:48.752
a deadly
space rock safe.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.720
We have that technology.

34:50.722 --> 34:52.589
We know how
to do it.

34:52.591 --> 34:54.324
You don't.

34:54.326 --> 34:56.259
So you have
two choices.

34:56.261 --> 34:58.378
And what are they?

34:58.379 --> 35:00.496
One, you get out of
the space harvesting game.

35:00.499 --> 35:01.832
The U.S. won't let you proceed

35:01.834 --> 35:03.767
as you've been
going because

35:03.769 --> 35:05.102
it threatens life
on this planet.

35:05.104 --> 35:07.604
Or two, we license you our tech,

35:07.606 --> 35:09.372
we show you how to confirm
if any specimen if safe

35:09.374 --> 35:11.341
before you bring it to Earth,

35:11.343 --> 35:14.511
and the U.S. will enforce
your exclusive right

35:14.513 --> 35:17.280
to our I.P. in exchange for
an 80/20 revenue split

35:17.282 --> 35:18.815
with America, in your favor.

35:23.589 --> 35:27.224
You have the authority
to do this?

35:27.226 --> 35:28.892
You're just a child.

35:28.894 --> 35:30.760
(soft chuckle)
Cabe?

35:30.762 --> 35:34.297
The U.S. embassy wants to meet
with you regarding this matter

35:34.299 --> 35:35.298
within the hour.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.134
This is a real offer,

35:37.136 --> 35:39.736
but my nation will only deal
with President Korsovich

35:39.738 --> 35:41.271
and his allies,

35:41.273 --> 35:43.507
who will remain in power,
unharmed.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.546
Agreed.

35:51.850 --> 35:53.150
Come on, boys.

35:53.152 --> 35:55.185
You know what to do.
Uncuff us.

35:55.187 --> 35:56.586
You just brokered
a peace treaty.

35:56.588 --> 35:57.587
Like a real statesman.

35:57.589 --> 35:59.189
I almost threw up twice.

35:59.191 --> 36:00.390
Let's keep that between us.

36:06.598 --> 36:09.900
ALLIE: I have never
needed a drink so badly.

36:12.838 --> 36:14.471
Today was...

36:14.473 --> 36:15.805
Par for the course.

36:17.609 --> 36:19.442
You were great, by the way.

36:19.444 --> 36:21.478
Truly appreciate
your help.

36:21.480 --> 36:22.746
The whole gang does.

36:22.748 --> 36:24.514
If they were here,
they'd tell you themselves.

36:26.485 --> 36:28.752
You really love those guys,

36:28.754 --> 36:30.921

(Toby clears throat)

37:33.719 --> 37:36.419
TOBY: Ah, dock that agent
a day's pay

37:36.421 --> 37:37.554
for napping on the job.

37:37.556 --> 37:38.488
WALTER:
Hey, Cabe, we're back.

37:42.561 --> 37:44.494
Hey, guys.

37:45.330 --> 37:46.429
It's good to see you.

37:46.431 --> 37:47.430
WALTER:
Same here.

37:47.432 --> 37:48.431
Where's Allie?

37:48.433 --> 37:49.499
We wanted to say
thank you.

37:49.501 --> 37:50.800
Oh, she's gone.

37:50.802 --> 37:52.269
She's gone for the day,

37:52.271 --> 37:53.937
or she's still<i> gone</i> gone?

37:53.939 --> 37:55.272
She's<i> gone</i> gone.

37:55.274 --> 37:56.573
But the important
thing is,

37:56.575 --> 37:57.574
is Patel's out,

37:57.576 --> 37:58.992
and you're in.

37:58.993 --> 38:00.409
The Alderman seat's yours
if you want it.

38:00.412 --> 38:02.312
Yeah, I'm not gonna take it.

38:02.314 --> 38:04.047
Why the hell not?

38:04.049 --> 38:06.583
Because you want me to and
I don't listen to stupid people.

38:06.585 --> 38:07.450
Excuse me?

38:07.452 --> 38:08.652
Might want to say

38:08.654 --> 38:09.919
that kind of stuff

38:09.921 --> 38:10.920
from a distance, Sly.

38:10.922 --> 38:11.921
No.

38:11.923 --> 38:13.456
I'm saying it to his face.

38:13.458 --> 38:14.724
Cabe, you are stupid.

38:14.726 --> 38:16.726
Allie's great.

38:16.728 --> 38:18.628
You like her and she likes you,

38:18.629 --> 38:20.529
but you won't be with her
just to try and protect me,

38:20.532 --> 38:23.433
and what she did doesn't
even bother me anymore.

38:23.435 --> 38:25.035
That's stupid.

38:28.040 --> 38:31.074
So you'd give up being Alderman
just to teach me a lesson?

38:31.076 --> 38:33.376
I'm offering you a trade.

38:33.378 --> 38:35.879
I'll take the oath of office
if you take Allie to dinner.

38:38.083 --> 38:40.884
You're turning into
a hell of a negotiator.

38:40.886 --> 38:42.786
Come on, I'm gonna
go see Allie,

38:42.788 --> 38:44.054
I'll give you
a ride home.

38:46.425 --> 38:47.891
Well, I have some
paperwork to do.

38:49.361 --> 38:52.696
So, you guys must need a
rest after today's case,

38:52.698 --> 38:54.831
right on the heels of all
that wedding running-around

38:54.833 --> 38:55.999
you've been doing.

38:56.001 --> 38:57.100
Yeah, you're telling me, sister.

38:57.102 --> 38:58.368
We are pooped.

38:58.370 --> 38:59.769
Liar.

38:59.771 --> 39:01.404
Happy's talking about
plunge pools,

39:01.406 --> 39:02.806
and has high-end
nail files

39:02.808 --> 39:04.725
and your skin's
never looked better.

39:04.726 --> 39:06.643
Really? I didn't think
anyone noticed.
Can it.

39:06.645 --> 39:08.645
I know you've been taking
advantage of the freebies

39:08.647 --> 39:10.447
from the venues,
and your gig is up.

39:10.449 --> 39:13.083
Paige, I am appalled
and insulted

39:13.085 --> 39:14.117
that you would even...

39:14.119 --> 39:15.585
Pay her off.
What?

39:15.587 --> 39:16.720
She wants a payoff.

39:16.722 --> 39:17.987
Give her the coupons

39:17.989 --> 39:19.122
from Harmony
Mansion Spa.

39:19.124 --> 39:20.790
Come on, Paige
wouldn't take a bribe.

39:20.792 --> 39:22.392
I want a bribe.

39:27.532 --> 39:29.466
I'm disappointed in you.

39:29.468 --> 39:30.633
You'll get over it.

39:33.905 --> 39:35.805
You know, if we get
out of here now,

39:35.807 --> 39:38.575
we could get a quick exfoliation
at that hotel on Sunset.

39:39.544 --> 39:41.144
Okay, let's do it.

39:41.146 --> 39:43.079
MAN: If you're looking
for rebates

39:43.081 --> 39:44.581
on solar panel installation...

39:44.583 --> 39:45.749
(beeps)

39:45.751 --> 39:47.417
MEL:
Mr. O'Brien, this is Mel Casey.

39:47.419 --> 39:49.619
I got your message. I can fit
Happy and Toby in next week.

39:49.621 --> 39:51.054
Please call me back
to set up a time.

39:52.023 --> 39:53.957
Another pre-marital lecturer?

39:53.959 --> 39:55.625
Walter,
it's your call,

39:55.627 --> 39:57.594
but I'm telling you
it's a mistake.

39:57.596 --> 39:59.562
No, I thought about
what you told me

39:59.564 --> 40:01.598
and, um,
you were right.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.566
So I cancelled all of them.

40:03.568 --> 40:05.468
Who left the message?

40:05.470 --> 40:07.470
Dance instructor.

40:07.471 --> 40:09.471
You know, Happy and Toby are
none too light on their feet,

40:09.474 --> 40:12.075
so I thought that they could
maybe learn something nice

40:12.077 --> 40:14.611
for their first dance
as husband and wife.

40:16.047 --> 40:18.081
Walter...

40:19.050 --> 40:21.618
That's...

40:21.620 --> 40:23.119
that 's actually sweet.

40:23.121 --> 40:26.689
Well, I also thought about what
you said regarding a wedding

40:26.691 --> 40:29.592
being a celebration of a special
bond between two people.

40:29.594 --> 40:32.462
And that got me thinking
about Erwin Schrodinger,

40:32.464 --> 40:34.531
the father of
quantum mechanics.

40:34.533 --> 40:36.550
Of course it did.

40:36.551 --> 40:38.568
Schrodinger once told a story
about how he loved his wife.

40:38.570 --> 40:40.503
Love made no scientific
sense to him;

40:40.505 --> 40:42.071
he couldn't explain the bond.

40:42.073 --> 40:45.575
But he said when they stared
into each other's eyes,

40:45.577 --> 40:47.777
their consciousness
must have been

40:47.779 --> 40:49.779
mathematically
identical because...

40:50.849 --> 40:54.484
...that's when love
made sense to him.

40:54.486 --> 40:56.986
When looking
into her eyes.

40:58.890 --> 41:02.025
So since you look into
someone's eyes when you dance,

41:02.027 --> 41:03.827
dance lessons made sense.

41:04.763 --> 41:06.463
Put that way,
it makes a lot of sense.

41:06.465 --> 41:08.248
Mm.

41:08.249 --> 41:10.032
Ooh, I also thought
about what you said

41:10.035 --> 41:13.837
about the unique
characteristics of one person

41:13.839 --> 41:15.839
combining with what makes
another person special

41:15.841 --> 41:18.908
