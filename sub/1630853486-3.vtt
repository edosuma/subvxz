53:07.020 --> 53:10.357
Or, more accurately, a simple human woman

53:10.357 --> 53:13.652
with a less-than-simple relationship
to our forebears.

53:15.070 --> 53:17.573
About two years ago, by your perception,

53:17.573 --> 53:22.035
you encountered a planet locked in
what you would call a "multiphasic" orbit.

53:22.035 --> 53:23.120
GRAYSON: That's right.

53:23.120 --> 53:25.163
Every 11 days, it would enter our space,

53:25.163 --> 53:27.374
and during that time,
it advanced 700 years.

53:27.374 --> 53:31.837
- And also during that time,
you watched as a religion sprang up.

53:31.837 --> 53:35.591
A religion devoted to you, thanks
to your clumsiness amid one of our...

53:35.591 --> 53:36.800
more primitive eras.

53:38.218 --> 53:39.344
- I'm sorry for that.

53:39.344 --> 53:41.221
- Ancient history, it's irrelevant.

53:41.221 --> 53:44.600
- Is that why you're here?
To check up on us?

53:44.600 --> 53:47.853
- No, no, we've been watching you
for some time.

53:47.853 --> 53:50.772
Don't worry, we're very discreet.

53:50.772 --> 53:53.901
But your significance to our past
made you a logical choice.

53:53.901 --> 53:56.153
Or at least as good as any other.

53:56.153 --> 53:58.614
- A choice, for what?

53:58.614 --> 54:03.285
- By your chronology,
roughly 50,000 years have passed for us.

54:03.285 --> 54:06.914
I won't bore you with the details,
but suffice it to say...

54:06.914 --> 54:08.081
we advanced.

54:08.081 --> 54:09.958
- You've evolved 50,000 years?

54:09.958 --> 54:13.253
- "Evolved" is an arcane term
in this case.

54:13.253 --> 54:15.547
Evolution is blind and drunk.

54:15.547 --> 54:18.550
It stumbles along by trial and error

54:18.550 --> 54:22.054
and emerges with a barely adequate
excuse for a being.

54:22.054 --> 54:23.096
No offense.

54:23.096 --> 54:24.431
- None taken.

54:24.431 --> 54:28.393
- Long ago,
we learned to take the reins of evolution

54:28.393 --> 54:30.145
and guide it with a greater efficiency.

54:30.145 --> 54:33.565
Let's just say... things moved faster.

54:33.565 --> 54:35.526
A lot faster.

54:36.985 --> 54:38.695
- You're immortal.

54:38.695 --> 54:40.489
- Gold star, Captain.

54:40.489 --> 54:43.367
The cultivation of the mind
becomes a lot less stressful

54:43.367 --> 54:45.202
when you don't have to worry about dying.

54:45.202 --> 54:48.413
- None of this explains why
you created these hallucinations.

54:48.413 --> 54:50.791
- Oh, everything you experienced was real.

54:50.791 --> 54:55.087
Think of them as custom-made
micro-universes, tailored just for you.

54:55.087 --> 54:57.214
The content was gathered
from your own minds

54:57.214 --> 54:58.632
and cultural databanks.

54:58.632 --> 55:00.801
That's not what mattered.

55:00.801 --> 55:04.638
What did matter is that
each of you experienced a moment

55:04.638 --> 55:06.390
when you thought you were going to die.

55:06.890 --> 55:08.892
And we were there
to experience it with you.

55:09.685 --> 55:13.981
I apologize for the brief disorientation.
That's what happens when you share a mind.

55:13.981 --> 55:17.860
- Why would you wish to experience death?

55:17.860 --> 55:19.820
- Immortality has its rewards.

55:19.820 --> 55:23.198
But after a while,
the drive to advance begins to atrophy.

55:23.198 --> 55:25.868
Once you've seen it all and done it all

55:25.868 --> 55:29.121
and time has no worth,
all that's left is...

55:29.121 --> 55:30.622
idle play.

55:31.164 --> 55:32.708
We've become complacent,

55:32.708 --> 55:36.253
because none of us can conceive
of our own mortality.

55:36.253 --> 55:38.422
That's why we had to see it
through your eyes.

55:38.422 --> 55:40.966
- Well, I'm glad you got
your existential rocks off,

55:40.966 --> 55:42.885
but the fact is, you put us through hell.

55:42.885 --> 55:45.095
- It was all in the interest of knowledge.

55:45.095 --> 55:48.390

you could still kill the worm.

55:50.267 --> 55:53.353

in the name of knowledge.

Didn't take us 50,000 years
to realize it was wrong.

55:58.150 --> 56:01.403

I promise you that.

56:01.904 --> 56:04.740
- What's it like, immortality?

56:04.740 --> 56:08.702
- You outgrew your gods and your nations,
as we did.

56:08.702 --> 56:11.997
You left your training wheels behind
and you made it to the stars.

56:11.997 --> 56:14.541
Your next hurdles are really no different.

56:14.541 --> 56:17.336
You simply must outgrow self.

56:17.961 --> 56:20.631
These abstractions
that you inhabit for now:

56:21.882 --> 56:26.386
Captain, Explorer, Husband...

56:26.887 --> 56:28.138
Man...

56:28.680 --> 56:32.351
they are irrelevant
when you become one with the cosmos.

56:32.351 --> 56:34.186
And when you do...

56:34.853 --> 56:39.024
sculpting a universe will be as simple
as blinking an eye.

neither of us can fathom
our own mortality.

57:42.004 --> 57:44.173
