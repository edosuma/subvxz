00:01.602 --> 00:03.071
ANNOUNCER: Everyday heroes
doing extraordinary things.

00:03.104 --> 00:04.338
9-1-1 returns.

00:04.372 --> 00:05.506
We're gonna find you.

00:05.539 --> 00:07.141
ANNOUNCER: Catch
all-new episodes Mondays

00:07.175 --> 00:09.377
and check out
our other Fox programs.

00:09.410 --> 00:12.180
Prodigal Son, Almost Family
and  The Resident.

00:12.213 --> 00:13.381
There's more to the story
than you know.

00:13.414 --> 00:14.948
Only on Fox.

00:17.585 --> 00:19.753
MC: Look out L.A.!

00:19.787 --> 00:21.255
The eggheads
over at JPL say

00:21.289 --> 00:22.990
there's a meteor shower
coming our way.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.492
But not to worry--
it's supposed to land

00:24.525 --> 00:26.427
smack-dab in the middle
of Pacific.

00:26.460 --> 00:29.830
So keep it tuned right here
to KSXI, K-Sexy Radio.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.932
And while we're
"Waiting for a Star to Fall",

00:31.965 --> 00:33.634
here's Boy Meets Girl.

00:35.436 --> 00:37.105
(knocking on door)

00:37.138 --> 00:38.872
Oh, my God, finally!

00:38.906 --> 00:41.575
Oh, wait.
You cannot lift alone.

00:41.609 --> 00:42.743
-He bring on dolly.
-(grunts)

00:42.776 --> 00:43.911
I got it, Ms. Ulyanov.

00:43.944 --> 00:45.613
It's not that bad.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.915
Lift with your knees, girl.

00:47.948 --> 00:50.084
(grunting)

00:50.118 --> 00:51.952
-Oh.
-(grunts)

00:51.985 --> 00:53.787
I'll slip the rent under
your door later, I promise.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.956
Oh, no, I not worry, Olivia.

00:55.989 --> 00:57.425
(clattering)

00:57.458 --> 00:59.760
You throw party for yourself?

00:59.793 --> 01:02.430
Pity party, yeah, pity rager.

01:02.463 --> 01:04.265
It's not every day
you get fired

01:04.298 --> 01:07.101
from your content creation job
because someone decided

01:07.135 --> 01:09.870
you "aren't getting
the voice of the blog."

01:09.903 --> 01:12.706
You think it's my RBF?
Don't answer that.

01:12.740 --> 01:15.209
Olivia, it's been days.

01:15.243 --> 01:17.245
You cannot stay inside forever.

01:17.278 --> 01:19.213
(scoffs)
Yes, I can.

01:19.247 --> 01:23.284
My forever just got
totally awesome.

01:23.317 --> 01:25.286
Because of blanket?

01:25.319 --> 01:27.255
Weighted blanket.

01:27.288 --> 01:29.089
It's like a perpetual hug,
Ms. Ulyanov,

01:29.123 --> 01:30.458
just precisely what I need.

01:30.491 --> 01:32.226
No, it's what I deserve.

01:32.260 --> 01:34.762
I'll see you in the spring.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.731
(tranquil music)

01:37.765 --> 01:39.233
NARRATOR (on phone):
You are not a receptacle

01:39.267 --> 01:41.068
for anyone's feelings.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.103
-You must fill your own cup...
- (sniffling)

01:43.137 --> 01:45.639
For you cannot pour
from an empty one.

01:45.673 --> 01:47.308
(slurps)

01:47.341 --> 01:48.476
(sighs)

01:48.509 --> 01:50.344
(loud bang)

01:50.378 --> 01:52.012
(meteorite whistling)

01:52.045 --> 01:53.181
(gasps)

01:53.214 --> 01:54.248
(bang)

01:54.282 --> 01:56.517
(gasping)
Olivia!

01:56.550 --> 02:00.321
-Olivia!
-(screaming)

02:00.354 --> 02:01.722
(bleeps)

02:06.160 --> 02:08.762
(sirens wailing)

02:08.796 --> 02:10.130
(horn honks)

02:10.164 --> 02:11.465
(dramatic music)

02:11.499 --> 02:12.933
Oh, I am one who called.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.101
Ma'am,
what's the name of the victim?

02:14.134 --> 02:15.203
Her name is Olivia.

02:15.236 --> 02:17.171
She is alive.
It is a miracle.

02:17.205 --> 02:20.040
I see it fall from space.

02:20.073 --> 02:21.475
(Olivia moaning)

02:21.509 --> 02:23.344
MS. ULYANOV:
It fall all the way

02:23.377 --> 02:26.046
from heaven
and land on top of her.

02:26.079 --> 02:27.215
You mean through her.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.816
This can't be happening,
right?

02:28.849 --> 02:30.117
CHIMNEY: Pulse is strong,

02:30.150 --> 02:31.685
airway's clear,
breathing's good.

02:31.719 --> 02:33.020
CRT is good.

02:33.053 --> 02:34.288
Olivia, I need you to tell me

02:34.322 --> 02:35.856
your pain level
from one to ten.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.958
It's, like, a four,
but it's throbbing.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.461
How am I even alive?
I have a hole in me!

02:40.494 --> 02:43.297
*

02:43.331 --> 02:45.032
-BUCK: Hey, Cap.
-CHIMNEY: It looks like

02:45.065 --> 02:47.201
left lower abdomen,
might have taken out

02:47.235 --> 02:48.902
the kidney or at least
lacerated it.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.738
Can you wiggle your toes
for me, ma'am?

02:51.939 --> 02:53.641
It definitely missed the spine,
Cap.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.476
CHIMNEY: Yeah,
and this weighted blanket

02:55.509 --> 02:57.044
contained the blast radius.

02:57.077 --> 02:59.079
Must have cauterized
most of the blood vessels

02:59.112 --> 03:01.048
on the way through
and the nerves too.

03:01.081 --> 03:03.050
That's why you're not
in excessive pain, Olivia.

03:03.083 --> 03:04.485
-Lucky me.
-Cap, we're gonna have to

03:04.518 --> 03:06.053
move her with this blanket.

03:06.086 --> 03:09.290
BUCK: And that chaise is
also fused to her, Cap.

03:10.291 --> 03:12.493
(tense music)

03:12.526 --> 03:15.429
Guys!
Guys, I--I found it.

03:15.463 --> 03:17.898
All the way from outer space.

03:17.931 --> 03:20.234
-Should I grab it?
-Doesn't belong to you, Buck.

03:20.268 --> 03:22.069
(as Harrison Ford)
It belongs in a museum.

03:22.102 --> 03:24.238
*

03:24.272 --> 03:26.240
Okay, we're gonna need
the saws, both of 'em.

03:26.274 --> 03:27.741
-Yeah.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

03:27.775 --> 03:28.942
Did you say saws?

03:28.976 --> 03:31.579
Did he say saws?
Did you say saws?

03:31.612 --> 03:34.214
(saw buzzing)

03:34.248 --> 03:35.783
Of all the people
on the planet,

03:35.816 --> 03:37.285
the thing had to hit me.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.419
BUCK:
You know what?

03:38.452 --> 03:39.453
Only one other person

03:39.487 --> 03:41.088
in history has ever been hit

03:41.121 --> 03:42.956
by a meteorite,
and that was in the '50s,

03:42.990 --> 03:44.925
which makes you pretty special.

03:44.958 --> 03:47.261
I don't feel special.
How do you know that?

03:47.295 --> 03:49.096
Why do you know that?

03:49.129 --> 03:51.064
Buck was on the pier
when the tsunami hit.

03:51.098 --> 03:53.601
He's kind of obsessed
with natural disasters.

03:53.634 --> 03:55.269
You want a natural disaster?
Pfft.

03:55.303 --> 03:56.437
Look no further than my life.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.071
Not anymore.

03:58.105 --> 03:59.440
Space rocks do not just

03:59.473 --> 04:00.941
fall out of the sky
onto anybody.

04:00.974 --> 04:02.776
You are gonna be famous.

04:02.810 --> 04:05.546
Okay, instant backboard
on three.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.214
One, two, three.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.882
*

04:08.916 --> 04:09.883
BUCK: All right, guys,
watch your step.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.051
Watch your step.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.287
*

04:13.321 --> 04:16.223
I can't believe
Hen missed this.

04:16.256 --> 04:19.259
-(phone buttons beep)
-(siren whirs)

04:19.293 --> 04:21.562
(solemn music)

04:21.595 --> 04:23.631
FRANK: Still not sleeping?

04:23.664 --> 04:26.233
Couple hours here and there,
but...

04:26.266 --> 04:28.636
*

04:28.669 --> 04:32.005
Every time I-I close my eyes...

04:32.039 --> 04:34.742
You see her face.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.511
I relive the moment.

04:37.545 --> 04:39.913
Last night, it was like...

04:39.947 --> 04:42.850
*

04:42.883 --> 04:46.687
I was crashing into her

04:46.720 --> 04:48.422
in slow motion...

04:48.456 --> 04:51.024
her injuries happening

04:51.058 --> 04:54.962
while the car was crumbling
around her.

04:54.995 --> 04:58.198
Wha--what is that?

04:58.231 --> 04:59.700
EDDIE: It's not normal,
right?

04:59.733 --> 05:01.769
I have these moments
that are good.

05:01.802 --> 05:05.706
We save someone from dying,
my kid does something awesome.

05:05.739 --> 05:09.142
It's moments where I should be

05:09.176 --> 05:12.613
happy or proud or both.

05:12.646 --> 05:15.048
I know that.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.784
Just don't feel it.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.118
There's no one right way

05:18.151 --> 05:19.387
to deal with trauma.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.654
All the first responders
I counsel

05:20.688 --> 05:22.289
process it differently.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.392
MADDIE: And yet you all ask
the same questions

05:24.425 --> 05:25.793
and press the same buttons.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.395
I mean,
this is my third session...

05:27.428 --> 05:29.530
You're not finding
therapy helpful?

05:29.563 --> 05:30.731
I used to.

05:30.764 --> 05:33.033
After Doug died, I did it all:

05:33.066 --> 05:36.404
talk therapy, group therapy,
cognitive processing.

05:36.437 --> 05:39.239
Spent six months just talking
about my feelings.

05:39.272 --> 05:40.874
I'm sorry none of it
helped you.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.242
What makes you think it didn't?

05:42.275 --> 05:44.211
'Cause you're sitting
in that chair.

05:44.244 --> 05:45.713
I don't wanna be.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.214
I'd rather be at home
with my kid,

05:47.247 --> 05:48.716
enjoying the one good thing
I have going on.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.050
FRANK: So why do you keep
coming back?

05:50.083 --> 05:51.919
I was ordered here by my boss.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.921
I know I need help
to process this.

05:53.954 --> 05:57.591
I don't want my kid to be
like me.

05:57.625 --> 06:00.227
I mean, Chris is always
this happy, open kid,

06:00.260 --> 06:02.563
ready to share
every thought in his head.

06:02.596 --> 06:05.833
But he was in...pain.

06:05.866 --> 06:09.236
He felt like he had
to hide that from me,

06:09.269 --> 06:10.771
pretend he was okay.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.773
*

06:12.806 --> 06:14.074
(sniffles, clears throat)

06:14.107 --> 06:15.242
I don't want that for him.

06:15.275 --> 06:17.277
I violated Department policy,

06:17.310 --> 06:20.914
violated a woman's trust,
and I am really sorry.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.616
I almost killed a guy
with my bare hands.

06:22.650 --> 06:25.453
I killed a young girl
in the prime of her life.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.287
I survived.
Doug didn't.

06:27.320 --> 06:30.591
*

06:30.624 --> 06:31.792
(light music)

06:31.825 --> 06:33.594
So you still haven't heard
anything

06:33.627 --> 06:34.795
from the chief about Hen?

06:34.828 --> 06:35.963
I would tell you
if they'd made

06:35.996 --> 06:37.431
a ruling, Buck--
they haven't.

06:37.465 --> 06:38.432
But shouldn't the investigators

06:38.466 --> 06:39.467
be done by now?

06:39.500 --> 06:40.634
We all know it was an accident.

06:40.668 --> 06:42.302
EDDIE: Saw her yesterday.

06:42.335 --> 06:43.771
I was on my way into Frank's,

06:43.804 --> 06:45.272
ran into her
outside the building.

06:45.305 --> 06:47.274
She seemed okay, just sad.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.209
You can't blame her
for that.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.612
-Or for anything.
BUCK: How's therapy with Frank?

06:51.645 --> 06:53.614
-Haven't seen him in a while.
-EDDIE: Seems good.

06:53.647 --> 06:56.884
Though I'm not really sure
he and I are...clicking.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.586
You should try talking
to Rosemary.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.554
I went to her after
the stabbing--she was great.

07:00.588 --> 07:02.790
-Is that the one I slept with?
-No, she doesn't work for

07:02.823 --> 07:04.892
the Department anymore.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.794
-You slept with your therapist?
-I was, uh,

07:06.827 --> 07:08.228
going through a phase.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.730
Hey, didn't you just go through

07:09.763 --> 07:10.898
-one of those?
-Yeah, yeah.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.466
-Hey, everybody.
-BOBBY: Hey.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.967
Well,
look who's back on the beat!

07:14.001 --> 07:15.302
Just thought I'd stop by,

07:15.335 --> 07:17.671
see if there's any word
on our girl, Hen.

07:17.705 --> 07:18.739
-CHIMNEY: You talk to her?
-(cell phone bleeps)

07:18.772 --> 07:20.508
No, I try, but all she wants

07:20.541 --> 07:21.675
to talk about is--

07:21.709 --> 07:23.243
The girl, yeah, I got that too.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.613
Ooh, ooh,
May just sent me a copy

07:25.646 --> 07:27.080
of her college essay.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.415
She emailed it to you?

07:28.448 --> 07:29.683
I guess she was too nervous

07:29.717 --> 07:31.585
to watch me read it in person.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.587
I remember the drama

07:33.621 --> 07:35.523
when my sister was applying
to college.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.357
Think that's half the reason
why I decided to join the army.

07:37.390 --> 07:39.092
Well, you tell
a 17-year-old kid

07:39.126 --> 07:41.261
that their future depends
on writing 600 perfect words,

07:41.294 --> 07:43.263
the pressure's gonna
get to 'em.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.765
I don't remember what
my college essay was about.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.133
Why don't you call Maddie
and ask her

07:46.166 --> 07:48.401
-what she wrote for you?
-(Bobby laughing)

07:49.803 --> 07:51.672
I am gonna kill this child.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.543
BOBBY:
"Living with the Enemy."

07:55.576 --> 07:57.645
I thought her essay
was about the tsunami.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.212
So did I.
It's not.

07:59.246 --> 08:01.715
Wait, uh,
who's the enemy in the essay?

08:01.749 --> 08:03.684
Me.

08:09.590 --> 08:13.160
(solemn music)

08:13.193 --> 08:15.195
BOBBY: It wasn't your fault.

08:15.228 --> 08:17.297
System logs show
that you pushed the button.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.498
Your light was green

08:18.532 --> 08:20.634
when you entered
the intersection.

08:20.668 --> 08:22.670
Her light never changed.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.639
Looks like it was
the circuit board

08:25.673 --> 08:27.240
on the streetlamp.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.209
One of the relays was fried.

08:29.242 --> 08:31.411
You did everything right.

08:31.444 --> 08:33.747
And she's still dead.

08:33.781 --> 08:36.049
But not because of you.
I know it doesn't

08:36.083 --> 08:37.585
feel that way,
that you feel responsible--

08:37.618 --> 08:40.120
Bobby, I'm the one
that drove into her.

08:42.122 --> 08:44.391
You can show me a million
pieces of paper

08:44.424 --> 08:46.426
that--that--that says
it's not my fault,

08:46.459 --> 08:48.762
but it's still gonna
feel like it is.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.599
Did you know
she played the cello?

08:51.632 --> 08:53.266
It was an accident, Hen.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.235
*

08:55.268 --> 08:57.004
You've been cleared
by the Department.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.539
You can return to duty
whenever you want.

09:00.473 --> 09:04.077
Um...I don't know
when I can come back.

09:04.111 --> 09:07.247
Karen and I are going away
for a few days, and, uh...

09:07.280 --> 09:10.450
*

09:10.483 --> 09:12.920
I think I'ma need some time.

09:12.953 --> 09:15.255
Take as much as you need.

09:15.288 --> 09:17.424
We'll be here
when you're ready.

09:17.457 --> 09:22.395
*

09:22.429 --> 09:25.398
ATHENA:
"My mother is a police officer.

09:25.432 --> 09:27.735
"It's what's she's been
my entire life.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.637
"I never questioned it.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.772
"But lately,
answering the question,

09:31.805 --> 09:33.941
"'What does your mother do?',

09:33.974 --> 09:37.945
fills me with something
that feels like shame."

09:37.978 --> 09:40.881
Shame?
My daughter's ashamed of me?

09:40.914 --> 09:44.217
Um, that's not
what she's saying.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.086
You haven't read it.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.093
What?

09:53.126 --> 09:55.295
-You did read it.
-Well...

09:55.328 --> 09:57.397
You knew she was writing this
about me.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.432
(sighs)

10:00.801 --> 10:02.235
We discussed it.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.071
She wanted to write
about something

10:04.104 --> 10:06.173
that mattered to her,
but she was worried

10:06.206 --> 10:07.607
about your reaction.

10:07.641 --> 10:08.976
Oh, yeah, so she just tells
the whole world

10:09.009 --> 10:10.510
that her mother
is a good-hearted

10:10.543 --> 10:13.346
but misguided cop
who has wasted her entire life

10:13.380 --> 10:16.083
trying to fix a system
that's broken beyond repair.

10:16.116 --> 10:19.086
Oh, she also said
that she admires you

10:19.119 --> 10:20.688
for everything
that you've done,

10:20.721 --> 10:22.522
everything that you try to do.

10:22.555 --> 10:23.691
What am I supposed to say
to her?

10:23.724 --> 10:25.458
The truth.

10:26.727 --> 10:29.429
Now you tell her
that you love her.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.864
You're proud of her,

10:30.898 --> 10:33.867
even if you don't agree
with her.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.805
Come on, Athena, this is
the promise that we made.

10:37.838 --> 10:40.273
When we had May and Harry,

10:40.307 --> 10:44.111
we promised ourselves--
we agreed that we were gonna

10:44.144 --> 10:48.816
raise our children to be
strong, smart, and independent,

10:48.849 --> 10:51.919
you know, give them room
to be their own people.

10:54.221 --> 10:56.489
This essay proves

10:56.523 --> 10:59.592
that we have done our job.

11:02.329 --> 11:05.799
That's easy for you to say,
'cause you're not the enemy.

11:05.833 --> 11:12.372
*

11:12.405 --> 11:13.807
So how's everything at home?

11:13.841 --> 11:15.042
Better, I guess.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.376
I mean, ever since the crash,

11:16.409 --> 11:18.545
Karen has been a rock.

11:18.578 --> 11:22.082
It's like that IVF stuff
never even happened.

11:22.115 --> 11:23.316
Well, that's something.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.385
My wife's a project manager.

11:25.418 --> 11:26.887
Looks like I'm her new project.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.088
(laughs)

11:28.121 --> 11:30.057
She wants to take me to this

11:30.090 --> 11:33.060
new-age-y wellness spa.

11:33.093 --> 11:35.996
She says
it'll have healing influences.

11:36.029 --> 11:39.733
Are there gonna be crystals?
'Cause sounds very crystal-ly.

11:39.767 --> 11:42.002
Listen, as long as there's
a comfortable bed

11:42.035 --> 11:44.571
and nobody trying to talk me
into getting a colonic...

11:44.604 --> 11:46.539
-(laughs)
-I'll give it a shot.

11:46.573 --> 11:49.977
And I'll try anything that'll
make me feel less awful.

11:51.611 --> 11:55.883
You know, make me feel like
I can do this job again.

11:55.916 --> 12:02.122
*

12:03.623 --> 12:07.895
You know,
someone once told me

12:07.928 --> 12:10.263
that the world is full
of patients,

12:10.297 --> 12:13.967
but what it really needs
is more caregivers.

12:14.001 --> 12:18.438
Hen,
you are the best caregiver

12:18.471 --> 12:20.107
that I know.

12:20.140 --> 12:24.377
So go do whatever
you need to do to heal you,

12:24.411 --> 12:27.948
because the world
needs you back

12:27.981 --> 12:30.083
and so do I.

12:32.619 --> 12:33.954
Eh.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.823
Yeah.

12:38.325 --> 12:39.793
Gotta love an early shift.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.962
-See ya tonight.
-I'll see ya.

12:41.995 --> 12:44.631
Maddie, bunch of us are
headed out on the town.

12:44.664 --> 12:46.766
We're thinking karaoke
and wings,

12:46.800 --> 12:48.135
not necessarily in that order.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.569
You should join us.

12:49.602 --> 12:50.637
We can toast
to your triumphant return.

12:50.670 --> 12:51.839
I'm gonna have to pass.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.240
I have plans with Buck.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.674
You sure?
He could join.

12:54.707 --> 12:56.276
No, you do not wanna hear

12:56.309 --> 12:57.410
Buck sing "Eye of the Tiger."

12:57.444 --> 12:58.812
It is painful,

12:58.846 --> 13:00.447
even with the one-armed
push-ups.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.082
Copy that.
Bye.

13:02.115 --> 13:05.285
Bye.
(cell phone rings)

13:06.786 --> 13:08.355
-Tara?
-TARA (over phone): Maddie?

13:08.388 --> 13:10.991
(sobs)
Maddie, oh, God.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.993
-I--I don't know what to do.
-What's wrong?

13:13.026 --> 13:14.527
TARA:
Can you come over?

13:14.561 --> 13:17.130
Are you hurt?
Did Vincent hurt you?

13:17.164 --> 13:18.531
TARA:
You were right.

13:18.565 --> 13:19.699
You were so right.

13:19.732 --> 13:21.534
I--I really need your help.

13:21.568 --> 13:23.803
-Please.
-Yeah, I'm on my way.

13:23.837 --> 13:26.706
(suspenseful music)

13:26.739 --> 13:30.510
*

13:30.543 --> 13:31.879
(knocking)

13:31.912 --> 13:35.648
*

13:35.682 --> 13:37.717
Thank God you're here.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.052
(whispers)
What happened?

13:39.086 --> 13:41.188
We--we fought.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.523
He--he came after me.

13:43.556 --> 13:44.657
(shaky breath)

13:44.691 --> 13:46.159
He was so mad.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.861
Okay, where is he?

13:47.895 --> 13:50.497
I didn't--I didn't
have a choice.

13:50.530 --> 13:53.633
(breathing hard)
I had to.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.335
You killed him.

13:55.368 --> 13:58.238
I thought I did,

13:58.271 --> 14:00.340
but he's still alive.

14:04.011 --> 14:06.546
(gasping)

14:06.579 --> 14:08.916
(softly)
She--she shot me.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.583
(gasps)

14:16.623 --> 14:18.591
(dramatic music)

14:18.625 --> 14:20.093
Vincent, can you hear me?

14:20.127 --> 14:21.261
(Vincent gasps)

14:21.294 --> 14:22.996
-No!
-Tara!

14:23.030 --> 14:24.564
You can't.
That's why I called you.

14:24.597 --> 14:25.999
To do what?

14:26.033 --> 14:27.834
To stand here
and watch him die?

14:27.867 --> 14:29.502
He can't die.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.171
I don't know, I don't know.
Should he die?

14:31.204 --> 14:32.906
I can't--I can't
think straight.

14:32.940 --> 14:34.942
I need--I need to think.

14:34.975 --> 14:38.278
(gurgling, gasping)

14:40.113 --> 14:41.414
Why?

14:43.116 --> 14:44.651
(Vincent gasps)

14:47.620 --> 14:49.422
-What are you doing?
-I'm saving him.

14:49.456 --> 14:51.091
And I am saving you.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.793
Everything in your life
gets worse if he dies.

14:55.762 --> 14:57.264
(groans)

14:57.297 --> 14:59.466
(Maddie panting)

14:59.499 --> 15:01.634
It was--It was
self-defense.

15:01.668 --> 15:02.936
It was...

15:02.970 --> 15:03.971
That is what you're gonna

15:04.004 --> 15:05.138
tell yourself a million times,

15:05.172 --> 15:06.106
but you will never

15:06.139 --> 15:07.874
completely believe it.

15:07.907 --> 15:11.411
(panting)

15:11.444 --> 15:13.313
Look, I killed my husband.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.283
(wheezes)

15:16.316 --> 15:18.918
And I wish that I didn't.

15:18.952 --> 15:22.422
I--I wish I didn't have to.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.391
But you--you survived,
though.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.393
I mean, you're--you're
free.

15:26.426 --> 15:30.063
*

15:30.097 --> 15:32.299
I killed someone
I used to love.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.834
I will never be
completely free of that.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.405
(Vincent gasps loudly)

15:38.438 --> 15:40.673
(groaning)

15:40.707 --> 15:44.244
Tara, please, call 9-1-1.

15:44.277 --> 15:47.680
(Vincent gasping)

15:47.714 --> 15:48.915
Hey.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.483
(cell phone clicks)

15:50.517 --> 15:52.119
WOMAN: 9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

15:52.152 --> 15:53.653
This is Maddie Kendall,

15:53.686 --> 15:56.656
dispatcher badge number
873951.

15:56.689 --> 15:59.359
I have a male in his 30s,
GSW to the upper torso.

15:59.392 --> 16:00.860
Don't ask me
any protocol questions

16:00.893 --> 16:02.762
and don't route me to an EMD.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.998
Be advised there is
a loaded firearm at the scene.

16:05.032 --> 16:06.533
WILLIAMS: Police!

16:06.566 --> 16:08.701
Hands up.
Hands up, hands up!

16:08.735 --> 16:10.037
Gun.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.438
I need both of
your hands up.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.773
(panting)

16:13.806 --> 16:16.009
I can only give you one.

16:16.043 --> 16:18.545
SINGER: * Shivers
running down my spine *

16:18.578 --> 16:21.781
* And you keep whispering

16:21.814 --> 16:24.884
* It's like you're listening

16:24.917 --> 16:26.453
(solemn pop music)

16:26.486 --> 16:29.956
* To me when I'm asleep

16:29.989 --> 16:32.659
* Secret chambers
of my heart *

16:32.692 --> 16:36.029
* Carve your name in there

16:36.063 --> 16:39.132
* It's like
you're always there *

16:39.166 --> 16:40.733
*

16:40.767 --> 16:44.404
* With me
when I can't breathe *

16:44.437 --> 16:45.705
(sirens wail)

16:45.738 --> 16:49.242
* I'm a stranger to myself

16:49.276 --> 16:54.147
* Becoming someone else

16:54.181 --> 16:57.917
* Mm

16:57.950 --> 16:59.986
*

17:00.019 --> 17:03.756
* I'm not in control

17:03.790 --> 17:06.726
* I'm not in
control *

17:06.759 --> 17:10.263
* I'm not in control

17:10.297 --> 17:13.333
* I'm not
in control *

17:13.366 --> 17:16.002
* I'm out of control

17:16.035 --> 17:18.905
*

17:18.938 --> 17:21.241
(tranquil flute music)

17:21.274 --> 17:22.609
*

17:22.642 --> 17:25.612
KAREN: See?
I told you it was nice.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.214
Yeah, well,
I don't see any crystals,

17:27.247 --> 17:28.281
so that's a bonus.

17:28.315 --> 17:29.782
(scoffs)

17:29.816 --> 17:31.418
Look,
we don't have to stay.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.086
You know,
if you just wanna go home--

17:33.120 --> 17:34.454
No. No, no, no.

17:34.487 --> 17:35.622
It's okay.

17:35.655 --> 17:36.923
Honestly,
it'll be nice for us

17:36.956 --> 17:38.258
to spend a few days away

17:38.291 --> 17:39.459
from everything
and everyone we know.

17:39.492 --> 17:42.762
You know, just me and you.
(chuckles)

17:42.795 --> 17:44.431
STACEY: Henrietta?

17:44.464 --> 17:46.799
Henrietta Wilson?

17:46.833 --> 17:49.302
It is you!

17:49.336 --> 17:50.770
Stacey?

17:50.803 --> 17:52.439
Yes!

17:52.472 --> 17:54.241
-(Stacey sighs)
-How are you?

17:54.274 --> 17:57.110
Alive and well, thanks to you.

17:57.144 --> 17:58.611
Stacey Mullins.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.113
I'm--I'm Hen's wife, Karen.

18:00.147 --> 18:02.449
-Nice to meet you.
-Delighted.

18:02.482 --> 18:04.083
I can't believe you're here.

18:04.117 --> 18:07.120
You have to let me buy you
drinks--no, dinner.

18:07.154 --> 18:09.956
Please let me buy you dinner.

18:09.989 --> 18:13.560
Well, uh, you know,
we just got here,

18:13.593 --> 18:15.395
and, uh, we haven't even
checked in yet.

18:15.428 --> 18:18.064
So why don't you give us
your room number,

18:18.097 --> 18:20.066
and we'll call you
when we get settled.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.235
Wonderful.
I'm in 209.

18:22.269 --> 18:23.736
(sighs)

18:23.770 --> 18:25.938
I can't believe you're here.

18:25.972 --> 18:27.340
Wow.

18:27.374 --> 18:29.342
*

18:29.376 --> 18:31.878
Who was that woman?

18:33.213 --> 18:35.915
She's the reason
I became a paramedic.

18:35.948 --> 18:39.952
(dramatic music)

18:41.621 --> 18:44.657
KAREN: I mean, you don't think
it's serendipity

18:44.691 --> 18:47.360
running into the life coach
whose life you saved?

18:47.394 --> 18:49.262
HEN: You don't believe in
serendipity.

18:49.296 --> 18:50.763
KAREN: All right,
what else would you call it?

18:50.797 --> 18:52.031
A coincidence.

18:52.064 --> 18:53.933
Yeah, a coincidence

18:53.966 --> 18:55.368
that offered to buy us dinner.

18:55.402 --> 18:57.103
We should take her up on it.

18:57.136 --> 19:00.039
Wha--do--you just want me
to sit there

19:00.072 --> 19:01.241
and have small talk with her?

19:02.475 --> 19:06.145
"Oh, Hen, how's life
as a paramedic?"

19:06.179 --> 19:08.481
"Oh, well, you know,
I saved your life.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.283
"I'm out here,
you know, long hours.

19:10.317 --> 19:12.185
I have a great team.
Oh, and I killed a girl."

19:12.219 --> 19:14.387
You did not kill her!

19:14.421 --> 19:16.623
-It was an--
-Accident.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.625
(solemn music)

19:18.658 --> 19:20.993
That's what everyone
keeps saying.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.798
Or maybe that was
serendipity too.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.034
-Hen.
-I'd love it if it was.

19:28.067 --> 19:30.303
If someone could give me
a reason

19:30.337 --> 19:32.505
why that poor girl is dead
and why I just walked away

19:32.539 --> 19:33.640
without a scratch.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.408
Please.

19:35.442 --> 19:38.077
Tell me how that fits
inside some grand design.

19:38.110 --> 19:39.679
I don't know.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.382
Okay?

19:42.415 --> 19:44.384
But I do know
that you did not mean

19:44.417 --> 19:46.085
to hurt that girl.

19:46.118 --> 19:48.087
You did everything right.
The report said--

19:48.120 --> 19:50.457
I don't remember pressing
the button.

19:51.758 --> 19:55.295
The report says I did,
but I don't remember doing it.

19:56.629 --> 19:58.398
Okay.

19:58.431 --> 20:01.601
Well, do you remember
putting on your seat belt?

20:05.104 --> 20:09.776
Every day,
we complete a million tasks

20:09.809 --> 20:13.246
just like the day before
and the day before that,

20:13.280 --> 20:16.249
and we don't remember them.

20:16.283 --> 20:18.585
I don't remember brushing
my teeth this morning,

20:18.618 --> 20:19.952
doesn't mean I didn't.

20:19.986 --> 20:22.455
But I should remember.

20:22.489 --> 20:24.291
That was an important moment.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.959
Only in retrospect.

20:26.993 --> 20:28.928
When you pressed that button,

20:28.961 --> 20:30.630
it was just another day.

20:30.663 --> 20:33.099
No.

20:33.132 --> 20:37.970
I gotta be able to trust myself
and my instinct.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.743
That's the only way
I'm gonna do the job.

20:43.776 --> 20:46.579
*

20:49.649 --> 20:51.718
Finger thoracostomy.

20:51.751 --> 20:52.785
(laughs)

20:52.819 --> 20:54.821
It's, uh--it's kinda badass.

20:58.157 --> 21:00.927
Come on, Mads,
you saved a guy's life,

21:00.960 --> 21:03.996
you know, one who seriously
did not deserve it.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.467
No.
Nobody deserves to die.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.436
WILLIAMS: Ms. Kendall,
sorry to keep you here so long.

21:09.469 --> 21:10.770
You can head home now.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.605
Wait, you don't wanna take
my statement?

21:12.639 --> 21:14.106
Detectives talked
to Mr. Dagostino

21:14.140 --> 21:15.408
before he went into
surgery.

21:15.442 --> 21:18.511
He said he shot himself
by accident.

21:18.545 --> 21:20.513
-An accident?
-WILLIAMS: Yeah.

21:20.547 --> 21:22.349
Yeah, that's what
I thought too.

21:22.382 --> 21:24.317
You folks have a good night.

21:24.351 --> 21:28.187
(dramatic music)

21:28.220 --> 21:30.990
(sighs)
I--I don't get it.

21:31.023 --> 21:32.692
Why would he lie for her?

21:33.693 --> 21:36.529
Maddie, I'm so glad
you're still here.

21:36.563 --> 21:38.264
I wanted to thank you.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.866
Thank you so much.

21:39.899 --> 21:41.434
Tara, what is--
what is going on?

21:41.468 --> 21:42.535
The officer just said--

21:42.569 --> 21:43.870
He said he could forgive me

21:43.903 --> 21:45.672
if I would forgive him,

21:45.705 --> 21:48.975
if we could--if we could
make things work.

21:50.242 --> 21:51.778
What?
No.

21:51.811 --> 21:54.013
It can be different now.

21:54.046 --> 21:56.616
We can be different.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.685
He--he promised.

21:58.718 --> 22:05.525
*

22:05.558 --> 22:09.762
You wanna stick around
in case she needs you?

22:11.364 --> 22:12.865
No.

22:12.899 --> 22:15.201
I can't help her anymore.

22:15.234 --> 22:18.505
*

22:23.943 --> 22:26.546
So she shoots him
and then takes him back?

22:26.579 --> 22:28.381
Yeah.

22:28.415 --> 22:30.550
And I thought my marriage
was complicated.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.251
How's your sister taking it?

22:33.620 --> 22:35.722
It's, uh--it's kind of
rough on her.

22:35.755 --> 22:37.424
You know,
I think she thought she could

22:37.457 --> 22:40.560
save Tara from Vincent,
but, you know, she's realizing

22:40.593 --> 22:43.763
that you can't save someone
from themselves,

22:43.796 --> 22:45.598
not if they don't want it.

22:45.632 --> 22:46.966
Ain't that the truth?

22:48.535 --> 22:51.003
Especially if you
aren't around

22:51.037 --> 22:53.573
to see that they
need saving.

22:53.606 --> 22:57.243
(somber music)

22:57.276 --> 22:59.746
Look, I'm sorry
I wasn't there, Eddie.

22:59.779 --> 23:03.750
You and Chris needed me,
and I had my head

23:03.783 --> 23:06.385
so far up my own behind
with that stupid lawsuit--

23:06.419 --> 23:08.621
-We're way past that, Buck.
-I'm not.

23:10.757 --> 23:12.825
I should have been there.

23:15.094 --> 23:18.631
Maybe I could have...talked
some sense into you.

23:18.665 --> 23:20.099
(snorts quietly)

23:20.132 --> 23:21.801
You talk sense into me?

23:21.834 --> 23:23.603
That'd've been interesting.

23:23.636 --> 23:25.472
I told you not to buy
that truck.

23:25.505 --> 23:27.273
Yeah,
you'd have talked me into

23:27.306 --> 23:28.941
buying something
more expensive.

23:28.975 --> 23:30.276
Yeah, fair point.

23:30.309 --> 23:32.111
Look, things got
a little out of hand

23:32.144 --> 23:33.946
for both of us.

23:33.980 --> 23:35.882
Don't beat yourself up
about it.

23:35.915 --> 23:38.618
Why,
'cause you'd rather do it?

23:38.651 --> 23:40.620
-Excuse me?
-Come on, Eddie.

23:40.653 --> 23:42.221
If you're not gonna be
honest with Frank,

23:42.254 --> 23:43.890
at least be honest with me.

23:43.923 --> 23:46.058
Who said I wasn't being honest
with Frank?

23:46.092 --> 23:48.127
You said
you two weren't clicking.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.797
Maybe I'm just not
a therapy kind of guy.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.465
Right, right, you,
uh--you prefer

23:52.499 --> 23:54.634
to work it out in the ring.

23:54.667 --> 23:57.403
There was no ring, Buck.
There was a fence.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.772
(chuckles)
Come on.

23:59.806 --> 24:01.808
You don't think
while you were

24:01.841 --> 24:06.012
going through your phase,
just maybe, you were

24:06.045 --> 24:07.980
throwing your punches
at the wrong guy?

24:08.014 --> 24:10.016
Seriously?

24:10.049 --> 24:11.851
You're gonna make it about you,
again?

24:11.884 --> 24:14.854
Look, I'm just saying,
you were pretty pissed.

24:14.887 --> 24:17.590
Now I thought for sure
that day in the grocery store

24:17.624 --> 24:19.191
you were gonna
take a swing at me.

24:19.225 --> 24:21.528
Not that
you didn't deserve it,

24:21.561 --> 24:22.962
but I wouldn't do that.

24:22.995 --> 24:24.463
You're on blood thinners.

24:24.497 --> 24:25.865
Well, I'd still take you.

24:25.898 --> 24:27.967
-You think so?
-I know.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.537
(bright music)

24:30.570 --> 24:34.874
You wanna go for the title?

24:34.907 --> 24:38.377
-(rock music)
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

24:38.410 --> 24:40.312
ANNOUNCER (on TV): K.O.!
-(all shout)

24:40.346 --> 24:42.214
(laughs)

24:42.248 --> 24:44.717
Yeah!
This is my kind of therapy.

24:44.751 --> 24:46.218
(both laugh)

24:46.252 --> 24:48.154
One more round.
Pick 'em up.

24:48.187 --> 24:49.321
(whooshing on TV)

24:49.355 --> 24:51.658
(romantic music)

24:51.691 --> 24:53.726
KAREN: I was in the wrong bar.

24:53.760 --> 24:58.565
I spent 40 minutes thinking
that my date had stood me up.

24:58.598 --> 25:01.701
(laughs)
But then Hen came in.

25:02.902 --> 25:04.070
Serendipity.

25:04.103 --> 25:05.538
I know, I know.

25:05.572 --> 25:07.406
It sounds really woo.

25:07.439 --> 25:09.642
But I gotta say,
after my brush with death,

25:09.676 --> 25:11.210
I'm kind of open to that.

25:11.243 --> 25:14.981
So you had
a near-death experience?

25:15.014 --> 25:17.584
Did you...see anything?

25:17.617 --> 25:20.720
Well, um, nothing supernatural,

25:20.753 --> 25:23.923
but I have
definitely seen things.

25:23.956 --> 25:25.424
Six years ago,

25:25.457 --> 25:28.427
I saw my daughter
walk down the aisle.

25:28.460 --> 25:31.764
Four years ago,
I saw my first grandchild,

25:31.798 --> 25:34.567
last year, my second.

25:34.601 --> 25:36.335
I've seen the world.

25:36.368 --> 25:39.672
I have visited everyone
who's mattered to me,

25:39.706 --> 25:41.273
and I've told each
and every one

25:41.307 --> 25:43.275
how much I love them.

25:43.309 --> 25:45.444
-KAREN: That's amazing.
-STACEY: It is.

25:45.477 --> 25:47.780
And every day,
I wake up grateful,

25:47.814 --> 25:49.949
grateful for my second chance.

25:49.982 --> 25:52.619
I'm grateful to God,

25:52.652 --> 25:54.787
but most of all,
I'm grateful to you, Hen.

25:54.821 --> 25:58.457
Thank you for saving my life.

25:58.490 --> 26:01.460
(emotional music)

26:01.493 --> 26:03.796
You're welcome.

26:06.298 --> 26:09.301
(truck horn honking)

26:14.340 --> 26:15.908
(bell dings)

26:15.942 --> 26:18.611
ERNEST: Anticipate.
You gotta learn to anticipate.

26:18.645 --> 26:19.879
You gotta have everything
in your hand

26:19.912 --> 26:21.380
when you hit the ground.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.716
When you hit the ground,
you gotta be ready to go.

26:23.750 --> 26:26.786
Time is the enemy.
Don't ever forget that.

26:26.819 --> 26:29.756
Yeah, they drilled that into me
when I took the job.

26:29.789 --> 26:32.058
The faster the run,
the happier the client.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.559
And the happier
the bottom line.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.427
Don't ever forget that either.

26:35.461 --> 26:38.230
Hey, protocol says we gotta
inspect the cargo on this stop.

26:38.264 --> 26:41.267
I got it.
I got it.

26:41.300 --> 26:42.669
Pump the gas.

26:43.770 --> 26:45.271
(mutters)
Get the gas.

26:45.304 --> 26:47.940
Young people always get
on my nerves.

26:49.508 --> 26:52.444
(tense music)

26:52.478 --> 26:59.285
*

27:01.053 --> 27:02.221
What the...

27:03.322 --> 27:04.791
Oh, my God.

27:04.824 --> 27:11.630
*

27:16.035 --> 27:18.838
You do realize
what this run is about.

27:20.139 --> 27:22.875
Company's cutting corners, kid,

27:22.909 --> 27:24.143
a lot of 'em.

27:24.176 --> 27:26.979
Take a look at that manifest.

27:27.013 --> 27:29.181
Tell me what you see.

27:29.215 --> 27:31.884
What am I looking for here?

27:31.918 --> 27:33.786
You see any steel drums?

27:33.820 --> 27:36.522
(construction worker yells)

27:36.555 --> 27:38.725
Ernest.
Ernest, look out!

27:38.758 --> 27:41.627
(tires screeching)

27:41.660 --> 27:44.663
*

27:44.697 --> 27:47.967
(crashing)

27:48.000 --> 27:49.668
ANKUSH: Ah!

27:51.838 --> 27:53.139
(tires screech,
truck horn blares)

27:53.172 --> 27:56.709
(explosion booms)

27:56.743 --> 27:59.746
(people yelling)

28:05.752 --> 28:06.753
(bleeps)

28:09.255 --> 28:10.890
Which tunnel, sir?

28:10.923 --> 28:12.091
CALLER (over phone):
2nd Street, downtown.

28:12.124 --> 28:13.225
The whole place is filling up

28:13.259 --> 28:14.560
-with smoke.
-Okay.

28:14.593 --> 28:15.594
Can you safely exit
your vehicle

28:15.627 --> 28:17.329
and get out of the tunnel?

28:17.363 --> 28:18.564
CALLER (over phone):
We're trying to help out

28:18.597 --> 28:20.099
one of the drivers right now.

28:20.132 --> 28:21.167
Holy crap, there's
a combustible sign

28:21.200 --> 28:22.568
on the burning truck.

28:22.601 --> 28:24.103
Is this thing gonna blow?

28:24.136 --> 28:25.671
MADDIE: Our concern
is your safety, sir.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.273
Let's just get you both
out of the tunnel.

28:27.306 --> 28:28.674
JAMAL: No,
we have no indication

28:28.707 --> 28:30.009
that it's a terrorist attack.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.110
A lot of calls coming in
from downtown.

28:31.143 --> 28:32.945
Okay, uh, everybody listen up.

28:32.979 --> 28:36.048
I need you all to initiate
traffic rerouting

28:36.082 --> 28:38.384
for the area around
the 2nd Street tunnel.

28:38.417 --> 28:39.786
Until we know exactly
what's burning in there,

28:39.819 --> 28:41.954
we're not taking any chances.

28:41.988 --> 28:44.456
Did you say the fire is white?

28:44.490 --> 28:46.225
CALLER:
Yeah, It's crazy.

28:46.258 --> 28:48.227
I've never seen anything
like this.

BOBBY:
Dispatch said two victims

29:05.812 --> 29:08.214
and a hazardous materials
recycling truck.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.282
I want you to grab the CO2
detection equipment,

29:10.316 --> 29:13.452
and I want everybody
in full turnouts and BAs--go!

29:13.485 --> 29:17.589

BUCK: Cap,
that's a bright one.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.076
EDDIE: Put my money
on magnesium.

29:37.109 --> 29:39.678
BOBBY: Chim, you're on him.
Eddie, Buck, check the driver.

29:39.711 --> 29:42.348
Everybody else, this entire
tunnel is an exclusion zone.

29:42.381 --> 29:43.649
Keep people away.
Go, go, go!

29:43.682 --> 29:47.353
*

29:47.386 --> 29:49.288
EDDIE: Cap, he's pinned.
I gotta go to the other side.

29:49.321 --> 29:50.422
-BOBBY: Okay.
-(radio interference)

29:50.456 --> 29:51.423
This is Captain Nash on scene

29:51.457 --> 29:52.458
at 2nd Street.

29:52.491 --> 29:53.860
We have a magnesium fire

29:53.893 --> 29:55.127
that is reactive to water.

29:55.161 --> 29:57.129
I need a liquid nitrogen truck

29:57.163 --> 29:58.931
dispatched immediately.

29:58.965 --> 29:59.932
Copy that, Captain Nash.

29:59.966 --> 30:01.868
Liquid nitrogen en route.

30:01.901 --> 30:03.435
BOBBY:
Chim, how's he doing?

30:03.469 --> 30:06.005
CHIMNEY: He's bradycardic,
pupils are uneven,

30:06.038 --> 30:07.339
GCS 12 and falling.

30:07.373 --> 30:08.674
BOBBY: Smoke's gonna get bad
in here.

30:08.707 --> 30:10.509
Get him out of here.
Go, go, go!

30:10.542 --> 30:12.811
CHIMNEY: I lost his pulse,
starting compression.

30:12.845 --> 30:15.214

-(Ankush wheezes)

30:15.247 --> 30:17.649

30:17.683 --> 30:19.285
BOBBY: What are we looking at,
Eddie?

30:19.318 --> 30:20.552
EDDIE: He's not impaled
or anything, but we're

30:20.586 --> 30:21.687
gonna need a jackhammer.

30:21.720 --> 30:22.821
BOBBY: No time for that.

30:22.855 --> 30:24.056
(metallic scrape)

(clangs)

30:25.724 --> 30:29.195

30:31.197 --> 30:33.132
BOBBY: This magnesium's
starting to burn real hot.

30:33.165 --> 30:35.201
We gotta get him out of here
soon.

30:35.234 --> 30:37.403
(saw buzzes)

30:37.436 --> 30:38.704
Saw's not gonna cut it.

Ah!
Oh, God!

30:40.672 --> 30:41.974
Oh, my God.

30:42.008 --> 30:43.809
BOBBY: Sir, try to remain calm.

30:43.842 --> 30:44.710
Tell me your name.

30:44.743 --> 30:47.046
Ernest.
Ernest...

30:47.079 --> 30:49.048
oh, magnesium.

30:49.081 --> 30:50.482
It's burning.

30:50.516 --> 30:51.550
You need to get out of here.

30:51.583 --> 30:52.919
BOBBY: Sir, it's okay.

30:52.952 --> 30:53.986
We are gonna get you out
of this truck.

30:54.020 --> 30:55.221
ERNEST: No.

30:55.254 --> 30:56.588
That's not the only thing
there.

30:56.622 --> 30:58.224
BOBBY: What else is back
there, Ernest?

30:58.257 --> 31:01.560
Cobalt-60.

31:01.593 --> 31:03.729
You were transporting
radioactive waste

31:03.762 --> 31:06.065
through the middle
of downtown Los Angeles?

31:06.098 --> 31:07.733
Company's cutting corners.

31:07.766 --> 31:09.168
(tense music)

31:09.201 --> 31:10.402
This is Captain Nash.

31:10.436 --> 31:12.338
Be advised, be advised.

31:12.371 --> 31:14.406
This truck contains cobalt-60.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.775
Start evacuating this area
in a three-block radius

31:16.808 --> 31:18.610
and order
all nonessential personnel

31:18.644 --> 31:19.946
outside the perimeter now.

31:19.979 --> 31:21.413
EDDIE:
That magnesium's gonna

31:21.447 --> 31:22.414
burn through those drums.

31:22.448 --> 31:23.449
Once that happens,

31:23.482 --> 31:24.450
this entire tunnel is gonna

31:24.483 --> 31:25.417
turn into Chernobyl.

31:25.451 --> 31:26.752
Hazmat and nitrogen will

31:26.785 --> 31:27.954
be here any minute, and I need

31:27.987 --> 31:29.055
both of you out there

31:29.088 --> 31:30.256
-when they land.
-Cap!

31:30.289 --> 31:31.890
Buck, it's okay.

31:31.924 --> 31:33.059
I will stay here with Ernest.

31:33.092 --> 31:34.260
I'll get him out of here.

31:34.293 --> 31:35.294
You gotta get out there

31:35.327 --> 31:36.295
and put out that fire.

31:36.328 --> 31:37.763
Now.
That's an order.

31:37.796 --> 31:39.298
I'll be right behind you.
Go!

31:39.331 --> 31:40.466
BUCK: All right, guys,
let's go!

31:40.499 --> 31:42.134
Let's go!
Come on!

31:58.084 --> 32:00.552
BUCK: Chim!

32:00.586 --> 32:01.787
Where's the hazmat
and the nitro?

32:01.820 --> 32:04.123
Delayed, too many cars trying

32:04.156 --> 32:06.092
to evacuate downtown.

32:06.125 --> 32:08.760
Cap, no hazmat or nitro yet.
We're coming back to you.

32:08.794 --> 32:10.462
BOBBY (over radio): Negative.
Negative!

32:10.496 --> 32:11.630
The cobalt has ignited.

32:11.663 --> 32:13.132
We're at gamma radiation level.

32:13.165 --> 32:14.800
I repeat, we are at gamma.

32:14.833 --> 32:16.068
Hold your position.

32:16.102 --> 32:21.407
*

32:21.440 --> 32:23.409
That's nuts.
Get out of here.

32:23.442 --> 32:25.344
BOBBY: Maybe some CO2 will
slow it down

32:25.377 --> 32:26.378
before I get that nitro.

32:27.813 --> 32:30.116
-(Ernest coughs)

where's that liquid nitrogen?

32:40.126 --> 32:41.193
EDDIE (over radio):
Nitrogen's landed, Cap.

32:41.227 --> 32:42.428
It's here.

32:42.461 --> 32:43.495
We need it now!

32:47.866 --> 32:50.269
-BOWMAN: Where's Captain Nash?
-Inside!

32:50.302 --> 32:51.937
-How long has he been in there?
-Too long.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.339
BOWMAN: All right,
let's go, guys.

32:53.372 --> 32:55.074
Put it out!

32:56.142 --> 32:58.377
Hey, are you ready?

32:58.410 --> 33:00.012
Come on!

33:00.046 --> 33:01.380
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

33:07.319 --> 33:10.289
BOWMAN: Captain Nash,
you're done.

33:10.322 --> 33:11.323
Gotta get him out of the cab!

33:11.357 --> 33:12.824
I got him--got him.

33:28.674 --> 33:31.543
(grunts)
The kid--the kid!

33:31.577 --> 33:33.379
You talking about Ankush?

33:33.412 --> 33:34.546
-ERNEST: Did he make it?
-He's stable.

33:34.580 --> 33:35.547
He's headed to the hospital.

33:35.581 --> 33:37.083
Oh, thank God.

(coughs)

33:38.750 --> 33:41.220

33:41.253 --> 33:42.821
BOWMAN (over radio):
Fire's out.

33:42.854 --> 33:44.423
I repeat, fire's out.

33:44.456 --> 33:48.260
Smoke's clear,
fallout's gonna be minimal.

33:48.294 --> 33:50.062
(sirens wailing)

33:50.096 --> 33:52.264
Maybe not for all of us.

34:01.807 --> 34:04.843

34:10.449 --> 34:12.551
MAN: This way, Captain.

34:12.584 --> 34:19.458
*

34:38.610 --> 34:39.911
Thank you.

34:41.147 --> 34:44.816
Okay.
Heart function looks good.

34:45.817 --> 34:47.786
And what about
the other tests?

34:47.819 --> 34:51.223
So far, mostly good news--
no enlargement of the thyroid,

34:51.257 --> 34:52.624
chest X-rays are clear.

34:52.658 --> 34:54.226
Your lungs don't appear
to have

34:54.260 --> 34:55.727
suffered any ill effects
from the exposure.

34:55.761 --> 34:57.563
What about the blood tests?

34:57.596 --> 34:59.631
Kidney and thyroid function
are normal.

34:59.665 --> 35:02.234
You said mostly?

35:02.268 --> 35:05.304
The urine test showed
trace amounts of cobalt.

35:05.337 --> 35:07.473
Not high, just elevated.

35:07.506 --> 35:10.309
Liver enzymes are also not
where I'd like them to be,

35:10.342 --> 35:12.411
but I'm not about to sound
any alarms yet.

35:12.444 --> 35:13.679
Yeah, but you're concerned.

35:13.712 --> 35:15.947
I'm cautious by nature.

35:15.981 --> 35:18.850
Good, so we won't worry
unless you tell us

35:18.884 --> 35:20.018
there's something
to worry about.

35:20.051 --> 35:21.320
Now, when can I go home?

35:21.353 --> 35:22.321
We'll probably send you home

35:22.354 --> 35:23.489
later today.

35:23.522 --> 35:24.856
You can even go back to work.

35:24.890 --> 35:26.592
But we will need
that battery of tests

35:26.625 --> 35:28.494
once a week
for the next six weeks

35:28.527 --> 35:31.263
until we are sure there are
no long-term effects.

35:31.297 --> 35:33.599
So I'll see you
in seven days.

35:33.632 --> 35:35.667
Looking forward to that.

35:35.701 --> 35:37.369
(solemn music)

35:37.403 --> 35:38.804
(sighs)

35:40.472 --> 35:42.841
I am not ready to be a widow.

35:42.874 --> 35:44.543
-Wasn't trying to make you one.
-Bobby--

35:44.576 --> 35:46.478
I had to slow down that fire,

35:46.512 --> 35:48.347
and the only way
I could do it was

35:48.380 --> 35:49.548
to get in the path
of the smoke.

35:49.581 --> 35:51.383
I didn't have a choice.

35:51.417 --> 35:53.685
-It's my job.
-(sighs)

35:53.719 --> 35:55.721
*

35:55.754 --> 35:57.656
You will not get sick on me.

35:57.689 --> 35:58.857
Deal.

35:58.890 --> 36:00.526
-Heh.
-Love you.

36:00.559 --> 36:02.661
I love you too.

36:02.694 --> 36:06.365
*

36:07.833 --> 36:09.801
(Karen groans)

36:09.835 --> 36:12.137
Feels like three hours
in traffic

36:12.170 --> 36:16.508
just undid all three days
of rest and relaxation.

36:16.542 --> 36:19.411
I'd say next time we should
fly somewhere, but--

36:19.445 --> 36:21.747
-Airports.
-Mm-mm.

36:21.780 --> 36:24.550
It was a pretty good trip,
though, despite the drive back.

36:24.583 --> 36:26.084
(groans)
Was it?

36:26.117 --> 36:29.421
I mean, the plan was
to recharge and reconnect.

36:29.455 --> 36:32.924
I feel like we only got
half that equation,

36:32.958 --> 36:36.262
and maybe you got
a little shortchanged.

36:36.295 --> 36:37.929
No, I didn't.

36:39.298 --> 36:41.900
I mean, all the stuff
Stacey said about

36:41.933 --> 36:46.405
living in the moment
and being grateful for it...

36:46.438 --> 36:47.639
I am.

36:49.708 --> 36:52.878
I'm grateful for you
and for Denny.

36:54.780 --> 36:57.082
I was worried
for a minute there.

36:57.115 --> 36:58.284
Yeah.

36:58.317 --> 37:00.419
That maybe we weren't enough.

37:00.452 --> 37:01.787
No.

37:01.820 --> 37:04.089
And I was worried
I wasn't enough for you,

37:04.122 --> 37:06.124
because I couldn't...

37:07.493 --> 37:10.462
And you could go find
somebody else.

37:11.497 --> 37:14.132
I know that most of that
was the hormones talking,

37:14.165 --> 37:15.634
but, uh...

37:15.667 --> 37:19.438
damn, they're loud.

37:19.471 --> 37:23.409
I never cared about
how many kids we had, Karen,

37:23.442 --> 37:26.945
just that we had them together.

37:26.978 --> 37:28.314
(murmurs)

37:29.815 --> 37:31.216
DENNY: I'm done.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.118
(groans)

37:33.151 --> 37:35.887
(Karen chuckles)

37:35.921 --> 37:38.457
I'm unpacked.
Can we go pick up Paisley now?

37:38.490 --> 37:40.626
Did you put away your stuff?

37:40.659 --> 37:42.628
Or did you just empty it out
on the bed?

37:42.661 --> 37:44.463
You only said "unpack."

37:44.496 --> 37:46.298
-Oh, ho-ho-ho.
-Oh, my God.

37:46.332 --> 37:47.733
Three days with Uncle Trey,

37:47.766 --> 37:50.736
and he's nailing us
on technicalities.

37:50.769 --> 37:52.771
All right, come on.
Let's go get the dog.

37:52.804 --> 37:55.140
-DENNY: Yes!
-(Hen groans)

37:55.173 --> 37:56.241
(door closes)

37:56.274 --> 37:58.910
(laughs)
It is indeed, right?

37:58.944 --> 38:00.846
-Hey.
-HARRY: You're home!

38:00.879 --> 38:03.449
BOBBY: Oh, this is a surprise.
I didn't think I'd get

38:03.482 --> 38:04.516
to see you until the weekend.

38:04.550 --> 38:06.017
MICHAEL: I figured you both

38:06.051 --> 38:07.519
would be tired after the day
you've had.

38:07.553 --> 38:09.020
Thought we'd come by
and make you dinner.

38:09.054 --> 38:10.121
Oh, thank you,

38:10.155 --> 38:11.757
'cause I know I'm exhausted.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.258
Are you okay?
We saw the driver on the news.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.026
They said he has lung damage,

38:15.060 --> 38:17.463
that he could get cancer
from being in that tunnel.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.132
Well, he wasn't wearing
the protective gear

38:21.166 --> 38:23.301
that firefighters wear,
and he was in that tunnel

38:23.335 --> 38:24.770
a lot longer than I was.

38:24.803 --> 38:26.938
-But are you okay?
-BOBBY: I feel fine.

38:26.972 --> 38:28.640
ATHENA: Which is what
we're gonna focus on,

38:28.674 --> 38:31.209
just being grateful
that Bobby made it home safe.

38:31.242 --> 38:33.679
They're already talking
about massive investigations,

38:33.712 --> 38:34.980
State, the Feds, OSHA.

38:35.013 --> 38:36.648
I mean,
it's gonna be a big mess.

38:36.682 --> 38:38.517
-(Athena sighs)
-I hope Ernest is ready for it.

38:38.550 --> 38:40.719
He's probably gonna lose
his job.

38:40.752 --> 38:43.355
That company is gonna make
his life a living hell,

38:43.389 --> 38:44.490
what's left of it.

38:44.523 --> 38:46.525
I think he's brave

38:46.558 --> 38:48.860
for telling the truth
and standing up

38:48.894 --> 38:49.895
for what's right.

38:49.928 --> 38:51.162
If more people did that,

38:51.196 --> 38:52.598
the world would be better.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.668
-(oven timer dings)
-Uh! That's dinner, okay?

38:56.702 --> 38:59.571
It needs 15 minutes to rest
and then we'll eat.

38:59.605 --> 39:00.972
Long enough for me
to take a shower

39:01.006 --> 39:03.074
with normal soap and water
this time.

39:03.108 --> 39:06.077
(solemn music)

39:06.111 --> 39:07.379
May.

39:08.747 --> 39:11.383
I wanted to talk to you
about your essay.

39:11.417 --> 39:13.419
Wasn't sure if you had
a chance to read it.

39:13.452 --> 39:16.755
I'm a police sergeant,
not an officer.

39:16.788 --> 39:19.925
I know maybe it seems like
it shouldn't mean much,

39:19.958 --> 39:21.427
but it does.

39:21.460 --> 39:23.595
I worked very hard
for that title.

39:23.629 --> 39:24.930
I'm sorry.
I can fix it.

39:24.963 --> 39:25.931
Good.

39:25.964 --> 39:27.433
Then I think it's all set

39:27.466 --> 39:28.600
to go out.

39:28.634 --> 39:30.101
It's a powerful essay.

39:30.135 --> 39:34.072
Admissions offices will be
very impressed with you.

39:34.105 --> 39:35.807
So you're not mad?

39:37.142 --> 39:39.344
I know you're still trying
to figure things out,

39:39.377 --> 39:41.112
figure yourself out.

39:41.146 --> 39:42.914
You and I might not
always agree

39:42.948 --> 39:45.451
on the choice the other makes,

39:45.484 --> 39:48.954
but I'm very proud
of what I do.

39:48.987 --> 39:50.422
I'm proud of who I am,

39:50.456 --> 39:52.958
and I just hope that one day,

39:52.991 --> 39:56.127
when you're my age,
that you'll be able

39:56.161 --> 39:58.964
to look at your daughter
and say the same.

39:58.997 --> 40:00.899
That's what I want for you.

40:00.932 --> 40:05.136
*

40:05.170 --> 40:06.304
I love you.

40:06.337 --> 40:07.806
I love you too, Mom.

40:07.839 --> 40:13.278
*

40:13.311 --> 40:14.946
That wasn't so bad, huh?

40:14.980 --> 40:17.282
I kind of wish she just said
she was mad at me.

40:17.315 --> 40:19.885
Oh, welcome to being
a grown-up.

40:19.918 --> 40:21.219
(chuckles)

40:21.252 --> 40:24.289
(The National's "Fake Empire")

40:24.322 --> 40:27.459
*

40:27.493 --> 40:28.960
Hey.

40:30.161 --> 40:32.063
Mm-mm.
(laughs)

40:32.097 --> 40:33.632
Have a good day, sweetie.

40:33.665 --> 40:35.233
*

40:35.266 --> 40:36.968
BERNINGER:
* Stay out super late

40:37.002 --> 40:39.738
HEN: Life hits you
head-on, sometimes.

40:39.771 --> 40:41.807
BERNINGER: * Making pies

40:41.840 --> 40:43.308
* Put a little something

40:43.341 --> 40:45.944
HEN: There's always
gonna be pain

40:45.977 --> 40:49.280
and the fallout
that comes with it.

40:49.314 --> 40:51.483
Thanks to a lot of brave souls,

40:51.517 --> 40:54.653
and one in particular,
this city dodged a bullet.

40:54.686 --> 40:56.021
But it ain't over.

40:56.054 --> 40:58.456
People need to know
what happened.

40:58.490 --> 41:01.693
Today,
the real fallout begins.

41:01.727 --> 41:05.130
Sometimes, it feels like
the universe is out to get you.

41:05.163 --> 41:07.833
But maybe, it's just trying
to get your attention.

41:07.866 --> 41:09.801
Who would have thought
that getting hit by a meteor

41:09.835 --> 41:11.803
would be the best thing
that ever happened to me?

41:11.837 --> 41:13.104
(laughs)

41:13.138 --> 41:15.507
I used to have this hole
inside me.

41:15.541 --> 41:17.976
But after having
an actual hole,

41:18.009 --> 41:19.878
I feel whole.

41:19.911 --> 41:21.513
FRANK: I was surprised
that you called.

41:21.547 --> 41:24.215
Your next mandated session's
not for another week.

41:24.249 --> 41:25.551
I know.

41:25.584 --> 41:27.318
I just really needed to talk.

41:27.352 --> 41:29.320
Okay.

41:29.354 --> 41:30.522
About?

41:30.556 --> 41:32.791
*

41:32.824 --> 41:33.792
(shaky breaths)

41:33.825 --> 41:34.793
How I really feel

41:34.826 --> 41:36.728
about killing my husband.

41:36.762 --> 41:38.496
HEN:
We can spend our days trying

41:38.530 --> 41:41.733
to understand the pain...

41:41.767 --> 41:43.802
and we should.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.837
That's how we heal.

41:45.871 --> 41:47.372
BERNINGER:
* Turn the light out

41:47.405 --> 41:49.040
* Say good night

41:49.074 --> 41:51.342
* No thinking
for a little while *

41:51.376 --> 41:52.878
*

41:52.911 --> 41:54.079
* Let's not try

41:54.112 --> 41:56.882
ALL: Hey!

41:56.915 --> 41:58.383
(all laugh)

41:58.416 --> 42:00.886
Hey, I heard I missed out

42:00.919 --> 42:03.822
on some pretty heroic stuff
while I was away.

42:03.855 --> 42:05.557
How you feeling, Cap?

42:05.591 --> 42:07.726
I'm just glad to have you back.

42:07.759 --> 42:09.661
BERNINGER:
* In a fake empire

42:09.695 --> 42:11.897
ALL: Aww.

42:11.930 --> 42:14.232
BUCK: Ah!

42:14.265 --> 42:16.735
HEN:
But we must always remember

42:16.768 --> 42:19.104
it's not the trauma
that defines us.

42:19.137 --> 42:20.105
(alarm blaring)

42:20.138 --> 42:21.272
It's how we choose

42:21.306 --> 42:22.608
to react to it,

42:22.641 --> 42:25.010
how we choose to move on.

42:25.043 --> 42:26.211
Chim.

42:27.646 --> 42:28.614
I'll drive.

42:28.647 --> 42:35.420
*

42:35.453 --> 42:36.421
All right!

42:36.454 --> 42:43.161
*

42:44.462 --> 42:47.465
