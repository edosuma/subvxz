<i>Hot in Cleveland</i>
is recorded

00:03.336 --> 00:04.921
in front of a live
studio audience.

00:05.004 --> 00:07.090
{\an5}(man)
Please take your seats.
We've closed the doors

00:07.173 --> 00:08.550
and begun preparations
for our flight to Paris.

00:08.633 --> 00:11.261
{\an3}Thank God.
I made it.

00:14.472 --> 00:15.265
Ohh...

00:15.348 --> 00:18.727
Actually, that was mine.

00:18.810 --> 00:20.895
{\an1}But you look like you needed it
more than I did.

00:20.979 --> 00:23.523
I'm so, so sorry.

00:23.606 --> 00:27.610
{\an3}I promise I won't touch
any of your cashews.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.612
{\an3}'Cept this one, 'cause
I haven't eaten all day.

00:29.696 --> 00:30.613
Help yourself.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.866
- I'm Tom.
- Oh, Melanie.

00:32.949 --> 00:34.784
Boy, have I had
a crazy day.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.119
What happened?

00:36.202 --> 00:36.953
It's a long story.

00:37.036 --> 00:39.748
{\an1}Well, it's a long flight,
nine hours.

00:39.831 --> 00:41.332
{\an1}Not that you'd talk
for that long.

00:41.416 --> 00:44.294
You don't know me
very well.

00:44.377 --> 00:45.628
{\an1}Go for it.

00:45.712 --> 00:48.131
Okay, well, first I have
to set things up.

00:48.214 --> 00:50.258
{\an3}Six years ago,
my friends and I

00:50.341 --> 00:51.634
were on a plane
just like this

00:51.718 --> 00:52.844
flying to Paris.

00:52.927 --> 00:53.845
But that plane crash-landed.

00:53.928 --> 00:57.098
{\an3}Oh, but, you know,
get that out of your mind.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.475
It would ruin the flight

00:58.558 --> 00:59.976
if the whole time
you're thinking,

01:00.059 --> 01:02.979
{\an3}"What if this girl's a jinx
and this plane crashes?"

01:03.062 --> 01:06.357
{\an1}I wasn't thinking that.
Until now.

01:07.776 --> 01:10.278
Anyway, we landed safely
in Cleveland,

01:10.361 --> 01:13.114
and then we ended up
living there.

01:13.198 --> 01:15.158
And tomorrow, my dear,
sweet friend Joy

01:15.241 --> 01:17.952
is gonna have her dream
wedding in Paris.

01:18.036 --> 01:21.164
We knew everything
was gonna change, so...

01:21.247 --> 01:24.375
yesterday we decided to just
put that out of our minds

01:24.459 --> 01:27.837
and just have the most fun
bachelorette party.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.297
[all sobbing]

01:29.380 --> 01:31.216
No, no, no!

01:31.299 --> 01:32.842
The rule of the evening
is no tears.

01:32.926 --> 01:36.346
{\an3}Whenever we feel sad,
let's just remember

01:36.429 --> 01:38.640
{\an3}my fabulous wedding
in Paris

01:38.723 --> 01:41.643
that people are flying to
from all over the world...

01:41.726 --> 01:43.394
{\an3}and Canada.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.021
(all)
To Paris!

01:45.104 --> 01:47.899
Ah...I'm gonna pull
another card

01:47.982 --> 01:50.235
from the bachelorette party
question deck.

01:50.318 --> 01:51.694
Okay, everyone.

01:51.778 --> 01:54.239
"What was the best sex
you ever had?"

01:54.322 --> 01:55.698
It's Bob.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.200
Honestly,
he's made me forget

01:57.283 --> 01:58.201
every other man
I've ever slept with.

01:58.284 --> 02:03.790
That must have emptied out
the old brain pan.

02:09.086 --> 02:09.753
What about you, Elka?

02:09.838 --> 02:12.632
- Sinatra, right?
- Nope, nope.

02:12.715 --> 02:15.552
The best orgasm
I ever had

02:15.635 --> 02:16.761
was when Joy said
she was leaving.

02:19.138 --> 02:21.391
Melanie.

02:21.474 --> 02:23.476
I-I don't wanna...say.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.353
Oh, come on, tell us.

02:25.436 --> 02:27.522
Honestly?
Bob.

02:27.605 --> 02:29.399
I mean, I know we only
slept together once,

02:29.482 --> 02:30.233
but he was amazing.
I'm sorry.

02:30.316 --> 02:32.735
Oh, no...

02:32.819 --> 02:33.903
You don't have to be.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.239
{\an3}I know neither one of you
has feelings for the other.

02:36.322 --> 02:39.075
{\an3}Just like you know that
if either one of you did,

02:39.158 --> 02:42.370
{\an3}I would have to cripple you
in some disfiguring way.

02:42.453 --> 02:45.540
Ah, this game is fun!

02:45.623 --> 02:48.251
{\an1}For me, the best
was the one who got away.

02:48.334 --> 02:49.711
Johnny Revere.

02:49.794 --> 02:51.254
{\an1}You know,
I read in the tabloids

02:51.337 --> 02:53.756
{\an1}that he's sleeping with
a different 20-year-old groupie

02:53.840 --> 02:56.384
{\an1}every night.
I bet he is miserable.

02:56.467 --> 02:59.262
Oh, I'll take that bet.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.932
Oh, I'm gonna miss this.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.768
Who can believe
we moved here six years ago

03:05.852 --> 03:08.229
just because men in a bar
thought we were hot?

03:08.313 --> 03:10.106
{\an3}The whole city
thought we were hot.

03:10.189 --> 03:12.734
{\an3}And we had a lot more dates here
than we would have had in L.A.

03:12.817 --> 03:15.069
{\an1}Although they haven't
all been great.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.112
Remember Pooh Bear?

03:16.195 --> 03:19.949
{\an1}He walked around in only
a T-shirt and nothing else?

03:20.033 --> 03:21.951
{\an1}Oh, and what about the guy
with the foot fetish

03:22.035 --> 03:23.077
{\an1}who made little outfits
for my toes?

03:23.161 --> 03:25.455
{\an1}Ugh...

03:25.538 --> 03:26.372
I've been with
an 18-year-old,

03:26.456 --> 03:30.001
a man who dressed up
like My Little Pony,

03:30.084 --> 03:31.586
and I almost married
a homeless lunatic

03:31.669 --> 03:33.171
just to get a green card.

03:33.254 --> 03:34.964
{\an3}Excuse me.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.842
Man boobs, webbed hands,
human tail,

03:37.926 --> 03:41.596
forehead nose, conjoined twins--
I win.

03:42.513 --> 03:45.642
All right, it's time for me
to pull out

03:45.725 --> 03:46.976
the name of the person

03:47.060 --> 03:48.144
who will give the toast
at my wedding,

03:48.227 --> 03:51.481
the one who will say lovely,
wonderful things about me

03:51.564 --> 03:54.484
on the happiest day
of my life.

03:58.237 --> 04:00.281
Melanie!

04:00.365 --> 04:02.951
Yes, it's Melanie!

04:06.746 --> 04:09.832
{\an3}I mean, it was an honor,
but public speaking--

04:09.916 --> 04:11.668
oh, it makes me
crazy nervous.

04:11.751 --> 04:14.170
The last time I did it,
I got these sweat stains

04:14.253 --> 04:17.257
that went from my armpits
all the way down to my waist.

04:17.339 --> 04:20.885
Oh, not to mention
the under-boob sweat crescents?

04:22.595 --> 04:25.473
Why am I telling you this?

04:25.556 --> 04:27.016
{\an1}[laughs]
Don't worry about it.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.643
I'll put it in the same
place as your suggestion

04:28.726 --> 04:31.062
{\an1}of dying in a hideous
plane crash.

04:31.145 --> 04:32.355
{\an3}Good, good.

04:32.438 --> 04:35.525
Anyway, so the night went on,
and we played some more games

04:35.608 --> 04:38.820
and then Victoria...boy.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.863
She dropped a really big
bombshell on us.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.532
{\an1}All right, Victoria.
Your turn.

04:42.615 --> 04:46.327
{\an1}"What is one thing
you've never told anyone?"

04:46.411 --> 04:48.663
Okay.

04:48.746 --> 04:51.207
{\an1}I have a major
announcement to make.

04:51.290 --> 04:53.084
Uh...

04:53.167 --> 04:57.005
after Joy's wedding,
I'm moving back to L.A.

04:58.589 --> 05:00.216
{\an1}What do you mean,
you're moving?

05:00.299 --> 05:02.885
Well, my agent, my manager,
my whole team all said

05:02.969 --> 05:05.555
that if I'm serious about
reinvigorating my career,

05:05.638 --> 05:07.724
I need to be in L.A.

05:07.807 --> 05:10.059
- But why?
- Well, think about it.

05:10.143 --> 05:13.104
If I'm in L.A.
and a Scarlett Johansson

05:13.187 --> 05:15.106
or a Natalie Portman
drop out of a project,

05:15.189 --> 05:16.190
then who do you think
they're gonna call?

05:18.317 --> 05:21.404
You?

05:21.487 --> 05:24.699
Exactly.

05:24.782 --> 05:27.368
Wow. Our house really is
splitting up.

05:27.452 --> 05:30.788
We're not even gonna be
in the same city.

05:30.872 --> 05:31.706
This wonderful time of us
living together

05:31.789 --> 05:34.584
is coming to an end.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.544
{\an6}[tearfully]
Do you think Bob
is having this much fun

05:36.627 --> 05:40.048
at his bachelor party?

05:43.509 --> 05:44.886
He's with a couple of friends.

05:44.969 --> 05:46.637
I'm not exactly sure
what he's doing.

05:46.721 --> 05:49.766
{\an1}[groaning]
Arrr...

05:49.849 --> 05:51.100
{\an3}Almost done.
You doing okay?

05:51.184 --> 05:54.020
{\an1}Yeah. Although it might
help if you told me again

05:54.103 --> 05:57.065
that I'm a brave
little soldier.

05:57.148 --> 05:59.442
You are a brave
little soldier.

05:59.525 --> 06:02.070
I like to think so.

06:02.153 --> 06:04.113
So you're getting
married tomorrow.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.783
{\an1}Yeah, yeah, to the woman
of my dreams.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.868
I'm a lucky man.

06:08.951 --> 06:10.453
{\an3}You are.
She's beautiful.

06:10.536 --> 06:11.537
Oh, I know.

06:11.621 --> 06:14.665
{\an3}And, if you don't mind me
saying, pretty stacked.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.876
Oh, I kn--what?

06:18.419 --> 06:21.089
{\an1}You're giving me a tattoo
of the woman on my right, right?

06:21.172 --> 06:22.340
{\an3}I thought you said
the woman on my right.

06:22.423 --> 06:25.802
{\an1}Wait--I need to see
this tattoo right now.

06:28.346 --> 06:29.972
Aah!

06:32.308 --> 06:35.228
I'm not worried.
Bob won't do anything stupid.

06:35.770 --> 06:38.773
You know,
he really is an amazing man.

06:38.856 --> 06:40.817
You are very lucky, Joy.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.069
Take a shower, Melanie.

06:46.614 --> 06:47.365
Well, this has been fun,

06:47.448 --> 06:49.158
but we should really get
some sleep.

06:49.242 --> 06:52.370
We're leaving for Paris
early tomorrow morning.

- What?

{\an8}She's pregnant?

07:12.098 --> 07:13.474
{\an9}You think the fetus
texted her

{\an9}that it's coming out
the next day?

They wanted to adopt,
and Joy found out

{\an9}there was a baby
available in Las Vegas.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.527

she was pretty frantic

you have a gambling problem.

{\an8}What are you doing here?

08:47.193 --> 08:48.444
{\an8}Well, I thought
you should know

08:48.527 --> 08:51.239
{\an7}before you get married
that, uh...

08:51.322 --> 08:54.742
{\an7}your mother and I have
gotten divorced.

Why would you wait

that you'd lose

find the perfect woman.

31:47.614 --> 31:50.450
Turns out it was me.

31:50.742 --> 31:54.495

a double wedding.
