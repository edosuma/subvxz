WEBVTT

00:04.676 --> 00:06.412
We are in Harlem. And
today we're gonna be creating a
music video.

00:06.412 --> 00:08.183
To guide you through
today's shoot, Director X.

00:08.183 --> 00:11.991
Hit that mark.
One take, one shot.

00:11.991 --> 00:14.796
Give something to the
camera.nMark, mark, mark, mark.

00:14.796 --> 00:16.867
This business,
if you would act the way
you act with me,

00:16.867 --> 00:19.673
with other people,

00:19.673 --> 00:21.275
you'd be blacklisted
so quickly.

00:21.275 --> 00:22.979
You're trying
to make me laugh
right now.

00:22.979 --> 00:25.317
I was trying
to seduce you, but fine.

00:25.317 --> 00:26.553
Kyle:
<i>Marissa is really hot
and really distracting.</i>

00:26.553 --> 00:30.360
So which one of you
is gonna stay?

00:30.360 --> 00:32.565
Marissa.
Kyle, I am so sorry.

00:32.565 --> 00:36.105
Kyle:
Marissa and I definitely
forged strong bonds,

00:36.105 --> 00:37.374
<i>and I think
she's gonna kill it
in the competition.</i>

00:37.374 --> 00:38.711
<i>Love you, Kyle.</i>

01:25.003 --> 01:29.546
<i>Oh, ho, ho.
India's video.</i>

01:29.546 --> 01:31.415
India,
your video's playing.

01:31.415 --> 01:32.886
- Oh, my God.
- You're adorable, India.

01:32.886 --> 01:35.424
<i>You killed the ( bleep ).</i>

01:35.424 --> 01:37.896
Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, India.

01:37.896 --> 01:41.436
I feel really,
really great at last.
I got best video.

01:41.436 --> 01:45.678
<i>The judges kept saying
that they were waiting</i>

01:45.678 --> 01:47.047
<i>for this moment
when I would start
to stand out,</i>

01:47.047 --> 01:49.553
and finally
this week I did it.

01:49.553 --> 01:52.925
Oh, that was so fire.

01:52.925 --> 01:55.765
India:
We're halfway through
this competition,

01:55.765 --> 01:57.434
and I can definitely
see the light

01:57.434 --> 01:59.405
at the end of the tunnel.

01:59.405 --> 02:00.908
<i>I only have
seven girls to beat.</i>

02:00.908 --> 02:02.879
That's a pretty small number--
pretty manageable,

02:02.879 --> 02:04.984
so I really do think
I can win.

02:04.984 --> 02:08.123
- Ah, I'm so proud.
- Thank you, girl.

02:08.123 --> 02:09.826
- You're welcome.
- Oh, God I've been
waiting for that.

02:09.826 --> 02:12.230
I'm just trying
not to jinx myself.

02:12.230 --> 02:13.734
- I'm just waiting
to wow them.
- Yeah.

02:15.070 --> 02:16.105
<i>Yeah.</i>

02:19.980 --> 02:21.617
Yeah, it's like--
it's never my time,
like, you know.

02:21.617 --> 02:24.155
I am just doing
the best that I can

02:24.155 --> 02:26.225
to try to get best photo
and be at the top.

02:26.225 --> 02:28.497
I mean, I just feel like
it hasn't been my week yet.

02:28.497 --> 02:30.333
I feel like
I'm kinda overshadowed

02:30.333 --> 02:32.237
by the personalities,
you know?

02:32.237 --> 02:34.475
I'm here
for a bigger purpose
than myself.

02:34.475 --> 02:36.012
<i>My parents have been divorced
since I can remember,</i>

02:36.012 --> 02:38.517
<i>and it was hard.</i>

02:38.517 --> 02:39.351
So I wanna to be able
to help my family,

02:39.351 --> 02:41.489
provide for them.

02:41.489 --> 02:42.290
Like, help my sister out,
help my family out,

02:42.290 --> 02:43.961
help my mom out.

02:43.961 --> 02:45.430
You're gonna shine
when there's a shoot

02:45.430 --> 02:47.268
or stylist
that's inspired by you.

02:47.268 --> 02:48.436
- <i>Exactly.</i>
- That's when
they're gonna give it.

02:48.436 --> 02:50.307
Like,
you know what I mean?

02:50.307 --> 02:52.244
Kyle.
She left some
awesome poetry...

02:52.244 --> 02:54.348
- Did you?
- ...in a letter.

02:54.348 --> 02:56.286
- Oh.
- I will miss her a lot.

02:56.286 --> 03:00.093
<i>Last panel was crazy.</i>

03:00.093 --> 03:03.099
Kyle was in
the bottom two
with me,

03:03.099 --> 03:05.336
and you don't understand
how friggin' awkward that was,

03:05.336 --> 03:07.875
<i>especially since we've
started our little romance.</i>

03:07.875 --> 03:11.683
I didn't
expect that at all.

03:11.683 --> 03:13.486
I wish that we could've
said something else to her

03:13.486 --> 03:17.027
before she, like, left.

03:17.027 --> 03:18.897
Ultimately,
I've always kept my head
very focused

03:18.897 --> 03:21.670
<i>that this
is a competition</i>

03:21.670 --> 03:23.874
and not to get
too close to anybody.

03:23.874 --> 03:26.479
<i>Yeah, it was a little sad,
because I mean,</i>

03:26.479 --> 03:27.849
<i>she's my cuddle buddy and
everything, but, I mean,</i>

03:27.849 --> 03:29.452
hey, we can cuddle
after I win.

03:29.452 --> 03:31.991
You guys...

03:31.991 --> 03:34.362
Binta:Today I felt like

03:34.362 --> 03:35.196
it was the hardest day
of my life in a way.

03:35.196 --> 03:38.336
Like, one of the hardest.

03:38.336 --> 03:39.739
Ashley and Law
was telling me

03:39.739 --> 03:41.844
that they did not like
my video at all.

03:41.844 --> 03:44.717
Oh, God,
that was so bad, Binta.

03:44.717 --> 03:46.887
- Really?
- You looked
bat ( bleep ) crazy.

03:46.887 --> 03:49.391
People basically
telling you

03:49.391 --> 03:51.897
that your work
is horrible

03:51.897 --> 03:53.567
at something
you love doing.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.739
So I was really emotional

03:55.739 --> 03:57.642
<i>because this is
everything to me.</i>

03:57.642 --> 04:00.648
<i>I was born in Gambia
and grew up poor,</i>

04:00.648 --> 04:03.754
<i>but I came from
good parents,</i>

04:03.754 --> 04:06.192
and me doing this
for myself

04:06.192 --> 04:08.931
<i>is me doing something
good for my family.</i>

04:08.931 --> 04:12.437
<i>That is why I know
I am fighting every day
of my life.</i>

04:12.437 --> 04:15.443
As long as you work hard
for something,

04:15.443 --> 04:17.214
you can achieve anything.

04:17.214 --> 04:17.748
<i>And that is what
I'm going to do.</i>

04:21.857 --> 04:26.534
<i>So that is gonna be the eggs
/ miscellaneous drawer.</i>

04:26.534 --> 04:30.240
And then you have
a freezer section, too.

04:30.240 --> 04:31.610
Your freezer section
is poppin'.

04:31.610 --> 04:32.578
- Let me see.
- It's poppin'.

04:38.958 --> 04:43.066
Yeah.

04:43.066 --> 04:44.435
No, I'm not.

04:44.435 --> 04:46.138
( laughs )

04:46.138 --> 04:48.143
Courtney...

04:48.143 --> 04:49.913
<i>On the inside, I kinda like
don't like her.</i>

04:49.913 --> 04:51.784
<i>Like she's always complaining
about everything,</i>

04:51.784 --> 04:53.954
<i>and she keeps being
disrespectful to people.</i>

04:53.954 --> 04:55.625
That is just sucky
to just be in this, like,

04:55.625 --> 04:58.129
toxic environment.

04:58.129 --> 04:59.833
<i>And it's bothering me
to a point</i>

04:59.833 --> 05:01.503
<i>where I have
to say something.</i>

05:01.503 --> 05:03.273
I've seen you, like,
the way you talk

05:03.273 --> 05:05.143
to some of the people,and
it's been irking me.

05:05.143 --> 05:07.081
It's just like your tone,
you're, like, short with them,

05:07.081 --> 05:08.784
<i>and you're rude,and when I've
beenseeing that I'm like,</i>

05:08.784 --> 05:10.254
"Ugh." I alwayswanna
say something.

05:10.254 --> 05:11.790
<i>People always think
that I'm, like, mad.</i>

05:11.790 --> 05:13.760
I literally have
resting bitch face,

05:13.760 --> 05:15.765
so it's very easy
to misinterpret

05:15.765 --> 05:18.303
if I'm pissed off
or if I'm happy.

05:18.303 --> 05:20.140
<i>I just wantedyou to
understandfor future
reference</i>

05:20.140 --> 05:21.476
that if I don't like the way
that you're treating someone,

05:21.476 --> 05:23.614
I will say something.

05:23.614 --> 05:24.147
I find that
interesting, though,

05:26.953 --> 05:28.658
because when
there's been instances

05:28.658 --> 05:30.093
where people haven't
treated me well,

05:30.093 --> 05:31.697
you haven't said anything.

05:31.697 --> 05:33.366
That has nothing
to do with what I'm saying.

05:33.366 --> 05:35.270
<i>I feel like this
is getting really heated.</i>

05:35.270 --> 05:36.472
It doesn't need to be
drawn into this whole thing.

05:36.472 --> 05:40.481
Now you're trying
to make me look crazy.

05:40.481 --> 05:42.685
She's like
trying to be like,
"Cory, calm down.

05:42.685 --> 05:44.790
<i>I'm not calling
you crazy.</i>

05:44.790 --> 05:46.359
- You said that, not me.
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>

05:46.359 --> 05:48.296
This is a victim thing.

05:48.296 --> 05:49.666
Okay, I don't wanna
talk about it anymore

05:49.666 --> 05:50.868
'cause we're clearly
not gonna see eye-to-eye.

05:50.868 --> 05:52.672
It's just
a runaround right now.

05:52.672 --> 05:54.275
This house
is wearing on me,

05:54.275 --> 05:58.049
<i>and I just cannot</i>

05:58.049 --> 06:00.655
<i>seem to get
a grip on living</i>

06:00.655 --> 06:03.326
<i>with these
( bleep ) bitches.</i>

06:03.326 --> 06:06.567
A lot of these girls
have had things handed to them.

06:06.567 --> 06:09.304
<i>Coryanne,
for instance,</i>

06:09.304 --> 06:11.442
so it's really
hard for me

06:11.442 --> 06:12.779
to be receptive
and understanding

06:12.779 --> 06:15.016
when they
bitch about things.

06:15.016 --> 06:16.787
I think it says something
about your character

06:16.787 --> 06:17.956
when you've
literally fought with
80% of the house.

06:17.956 --> 06:19.860
Dude, like, grow up.

06:19.860 --> 06:21.997
<i>It's totally her goal</i>

06:21.997 --> 06:23.667
<i>to just cause drama
and get attention</i>

06:23.667 --> 06:24.803
<i>and have everyone
talking about it.</i>

06:24.803 --> 06:26.305
It's not the
Courtney show.

06:26.305 --> 06:27.642
It's the ( bleep )
Coryanne show.

06:27.642 --> 06:29.178
Okay? I'm the superstar
in this bitch.

06:29.178 --> 06:30.915
I'm like, "Ick."
That's how I feel about her.

06:30.915 --> 06:32.017
So I'm like, "Ick."

06:38.029 --> 06:42.505
Ah.

06:42.505 --> 06:44.141
<i>Hey, guys.
Rita alert.</i>

06:44.141 --> 06:45.343
Hi ladies, good morning,
and congratulations

06:48.482 --> 06:50.521
on making it halfway
through the competition.

06:50.521 --> 06:52.191
For the eight of you,
it's time to get a taste
of the high life.

06:52.191 --> 06:54.563
<i>So this week,
we want to remind you</i>

06:54.563 --> 06:56.266
<i>what you're aiming for...</i>

06:56.266 --> 06:58.236
<i>a life of luxury.</i>

06:58.236 --> 07:00.239
So designer Philipp Plein

07:00.239 --> 07:02.044
wants you to
attend a party.

07:02.044 --> 07:04.448
- All: What?
- <i>Outside there's cars</i>

07:04.448 --> 07:05.852
<i>to whisk you away
to his showroom.</i>

07:05.852 --> 07:07.955
Remember, be your boss
and command the room.

07:07.955 --> 07:11.630
- We're going
to a party right now?
- Party.

07:11.630 --> 07:14.101
- We're going to a party!
- <i>Philipp Plein!</i>

07:14.101 --> 07:15.605
Philipp Plein
is a European designer,

07:15.605 --> 07:19.010
and the all met Philipp
in casting week.

07:19.010 --> 07:20.748
So we're gonna see
Philipp Plein,

07:23.352 --> 07:24.923
<i>but the first time he was
so intimidating to me.</i>

07:24.923 --> 07:27.394
Let's try it please again
because it was terrible.

07:27.394 --> 07:29.465
It's called "Top Model"
not "Flop Model."

07:29.465 --> 07:31.636
So I'm very nervous.

07:33.774 --> 07:35.276
I really just hope
my personality can come through,

07:35.276 --> 07:37.114
get past the nerves,
I can breathe through them.

07:37.114 --> 07:38.082
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

07:41.455 --> 07:42.625
Cody:
When we get the Rita message
about the high life,

07:42.625 --> 07:44.963
<i>I'm excited.</i>

07:44.963 --> 07:46.499
When I think
of the high life,

07:46.499 --> 07:48.069
I think of private jets,
throwing money.

07:48.069 --> 07:50.373
Everything that I would like
to do in my lifetime.

08:00.393 --> 08:05.270
( all cheering )

08:05.270 --> 08:06.506
Paige:
Philipp Plein's studio
is stunning.

08:08.443 --> 08:09.512
<i>The whole thing is set up
with clothes everywhere,</i>

08:12.652 --> 08:14.756
<i>shoes, bags.</i>

08:14.756 --> 08:15.924
It is a girl's dream.

08:22.037 --> 08:26.914
I feel sexy for once
in this entire competition.

08:26.914 --> 08:29.251
These are the most
beautiful Paige sneakers

08:29.251 --> 08:32.457
I've ever seen.

08:32.457 --> 08:33.593
- Oh, I love this.
- This is nice.

08:33.593 --> 08:36.098
That is nice.

08:36.098 --> 08:37.669
Back home, I live
paycheck to paycheck,

08:37.669 --> 08:40.642
<i>but trying on
all these fancy dresses</i>

08:40.642 --> 08:42.845
and just a bunch
of expensive ( bleep ),

08:42.845 --> 08:45.017
I'm feeling already
like a celebrity.

08:45.017 --> 08:47.053
Like, I could definitely
get used to that.

08:47.053 --> 08:50.026
Tati, she's like using the comb
on my scalp, it's like, ah.

08:50.026 --> 08:54.135
( all laughing )

08:54.135 --> 08:54.669
Courtney:
<i>Coryanne is very phony.</i>

08:57.007 --> 09:00.013
<i>Like, I thought
we were so close,</i>

09:00.013 --> 09:02.351
<i>but, no, we're not.</i>

09:02.351 --> 09:03.721
And, honestly,
yesterday's incident,

09:03.721 --> 09:06.794
it's been eating at me
and eating at me.

09:06.794 --> 09:09.365
So I'm not in a good--
a good mindset.

09:09.365 --> 09:12.204
I feel like a princess.

09:12.204 --> 09:13.707
<i>Today I'm a princess.</i>

09:13.707 --> 09:16.211
I've got
a full team with me.

09:16.211 --> 09:18.684
Ever since I was younger,
my parents have always told me

09:18.684 --> 09:19.886
that I was
high-maintenance
and shallow,

09:19.886 --> 09:21.488
but I know that.

09:21.488 --> 09:23.393
<i>It's just how it is.</i>

09:23.393 --> 09:24.428
<i>I love all my friends.
I love my social life.</i>

09:24.428 --> 09:26.900
I love how much I go out.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.570
I love all the dinners I go to.
I love my style.

09:28.570 --> 09:30.374
I love my job--
my perfect life-
it's perfect.

09:30.374 --> 09:33.880
Ugh. I look so chic.

09:33.880 --> 09:38.056
Courtney:
The difference between
Coryanne and I

09:38.056 --> 09:39.726
<i>is that she's used to getting
everything that she wants</i>

09:39.726 --> 09:42.330
<i>and I'm used
to not getting anything,</i>

09:42.330 --> 09:44.736
<i>and it clashes.</i>

09:44.736 --> 09:46.773
<i>'Cause I need this.</i>

09:46.773 --> 09:48.543
I don't have
a bunch of money.

09:48.543 --> 09:50.046
I don't have things
that are handed to me.

09:50.046 --> 09:53.086
Like this is it for me.

09:53.086 --> 09:54.221
( exhales deeply )
I feel like Cinderella.

09:54.221 --> 09:56.626
<i>If the shoe fits.</i>

09:56.626 --> 09:57.628
Give me the purse.
It isn't yours.

10:00.400 --> 10:03.072
- Give it to me!
- Never.

10:03.072 --> 10:05.611
It's weak,
it's weak, it's weak.

10:05.611 --> 10:07.414
You're not, "Ugh,
I'm getting on the plane,"

10:07.414 --> 10:08.951
you're, "Ugh!"
Getting on the plane.

10:08.951 --> 10:10.888
<i>She didn't really have
the special face.</i>

10:10.888 --> 10:13.092
- <i>She didn't add any
value.</i> - I don't think it's
us.

10:13.092 --> 10:14.027
I don't think
it's the competition.
I think it's you.

10:28.389 --> 10:30.427
India:
<i>This house is decked out.</i>

10:30.427 --> 10:32.565
<i>Every little inch
of this home</i>

10:32.565 --> 10:34.669
has been designed
to perfection.

10:34.669 --> 10:36.806
Welcome, everybody.
You look amazing.

10:36.806 --> 10:39.144
Tonight I'm gonna

10:39.144 --> 10:40.413
host an exclusive party
in my house,

10:40.413 --> 10:42.652
and you are
the feature attraction

10:42.652 --> 10:45.925
of my party tonight

10:45.925 --> 10:47.929
because you are wearing
the latest couture collection

10:47.929 --> 10:50.500
straight from the runway.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.137
There's no dress
which cost under $10,000.

10:52.137 --> 10:54.241
- <i>Okay?</i>
- Wow.

10:54.241 --> 10:55.645
Tonight you're
gonna be creating

10:55.645 --> 10:57.648
a fashion editorial
come to life.

10:57.648 --> 10:59.018
You'll be posing and
modeling in Philipp's gorgeous
creations

10:59.018 --> 11:01.455
all over this
amazing, sick house.

11:01.455 --> 11:04.596
Think of it like
a page torn from a magazine.

11:04.596 --> 11:07.100
And, actually,
Diane Von Furstenberg

11:07.100 --> 11:08.403
<i>just showed
her last collection
this exact same way.</i>

11:08.403 --> 11:11.342
- Wow.
- In about 30 minutes,

11:11.342 --> 11:13.613
this house is gonna be filled
with the fashion elite.

11:13.613 --> 11:15.416
You never know
what celebrity guests
may pop in tonight.

11:15.416 --> 11:19.191
And your job
is to work together
and work the room

11:19.191 --> 11:22.765
in the best way
to model these clothes.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.267
So we're gonna be
pairing you off and assigning
each group a room.

11:24.267 --> 11:27.875
Room 1 will be
Tatiana and Coryanne,

11:27.875 --> 11:29.879
Room 2 will be
Paige and Binta,

11:29.879 --> 11:32.050
Room 3,
India and Courtney,

11:32.050 --> 11:35.190
and in Room 4,
Cody and Marissa.

11:35.190 --> 11:38.029
All of the guests tonight
will be voting

11:38.029 --> 11:39.397
which door they think
makes the best live fashion
editorial of tonight.

11:40.534 --> 11:45.544
I want to see you
performing.

11:45.544 --> 11:47.548
And, girls,
I think you're really
gonna enjoy the prize.

11:47.548 --> 11:51.221
Philipp Plein:
<i>I think so, too.</i>

11:51.221 --> 11:53.225
I have to say
it's something very special.

11:53.225 --> 11:54.729
<i>I'm gonna take
the winner to Madison Avenue
where my store is</i>

11:54.729 --> 11:58.369
<i>and open up
the store for you</i>

11:58.369 --> 11:59.906
and you can choose
whatever you want in the store.

11:59.906 --> 12:02.545
Unlimited shopping spree
at Philipp Plein's store.

12:02.545 --> 12:06.051
What?

12:06.051 --> 12:07.922
This is the glamorous lifestyle
of being a top model.

12:07.922 --> 12:11.229
So let's get you
up to your rooms,
start practicing,

12:11.229 --> 12:12.497
because the guests
will be here in minutes.

12:14.602 --> 12:15.537
( bottle pops )

12:18.877 --> 12:20.914
You're just a live model.

12:20.914 --> 12:22.719
My friend does this for
Gucci all the time at the store.

12:22.719 --> 12:25.490
She just walks around
in her gown,

12:25.490 --> 12:27.528
and she just
sells the clothes.

12:27.528 --> 12:29.031
Let's think of a
storyline, and then we can just
act it out.

12:29.031 --> 12:31.235
I could walk in
with the rose...

12:31.235 --> 12:32.905
- Ooh! Okay, okay!
- Something like that.

12:32.905 --> 12:35.443
We want to like
interact and engage.

12:35.443 --> 12:37.247
We came up with this cool
little idea of us being

12:37.247 --> 12:41.188
like a lesbian couple.

12:41.188 --> 12:42.424
Interact
and like give them
some fun.

12:42.424 --> 12:45.063
I don't know
if we're in a battle

12:45.063 --> 12:46.398
or if we're
friends or what,

12:46.398 --> 12:46.799
but we have some sort
of relationship.

12:58.624 --> 13:03.734
Cody:Oh, ( bleep )
Jason Derulo is really here.

13:03.734 --> 13:06.639
- Marissa: <i>Really?</i>
- I'm not kidding.

13:06.639 --> 13:08.209
Cody:
<i>Jason Derulo is an amazing
recording artist</i>

13:08.209 --> 13:11.248
<i>who has tons of songs
on the pop charts.</i>

13:11.248 --> 13:13.754
<i>It was really
crazy to see him.
I was so nervous.</i>

13:13.754 --> 13:15.489
I was shaking,
and I'm trying to keep
my composure

13:15.489 --> 13:18.296
the entire time.

13:18.296 --> 13:20.233
Welcome, everybody.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.237
Tonight I have positioned

13:22.237 --> 13:24.107
<i>in all different rooms
two models</i>

13:24.107 --> 13:25.978
modeling my last runway
couture collection,

13:25.978 --> 13:28.316
and I want you
to vote which room

13:28.316 --> 13:31.255
and which two
you like best.

13:31.255 --> 13:32.925
And then at the end,we
gonna count and decide

13:32.925 --> 13:35.731
who's the winnerof tonight.

13:35.731 --> 13:36.933
Enjoy this evening,
the party, the food, the drinks,

13:36.933 --> 13:38.670
and of course,
the collection.

13:50.761 --> 13:55.370
It's very
"Suicide Club,"
"Hunger Games,"

13:55.370 --> 13:57.173
and "Glitter"
all together.

13:58.510 --> 13:58.643
Man:
See, that's a great pose,
actually.

14:05.992 --> 14:11.368
Marissa:
This challenge
is really important.

14:11.368 --> 14:13.206
<i>There's really
no time for screw-ups,
especially for me,</i>

14:13.206 --> 14:15.544
<i>because I've already
been in the bottom</i>

14:15.544 --> 14:16.211
so I just need to push
myself 10 times harder.

14:21.890 --> 14:26.298
Philipp:
Think about the fashion
editorials of the magazines.

14:26.298 --> 14:28.570
<i>Think about art.</i>

14:28.570 --> 14:30.608
It's not the dress
who makes the girl
look beautiful,

14:30.608 --> 14:31.509
<i>it's the woman who makes
the dress look beautiful.</i>

14:35.216 --> 14:39.224
India: <i>Last week
I got best video,</i>

14:39.224 --> 14:41.395
and I'm hoping
to stay on top.

14:41.395 --> 14:43.298
Man:
<i>All right, here we go.</i>

14:43.298 --> 14:44.334
Let's see
a little bit more fashion.

14:47.575 --> 14:49.344
Let's see
a little bit more
editorial.

14:49.344 --> 14:50.981
Attitude. Sophisticated.
Model the collection.

14:50.981 --> 14:53.753
- Sit down, cross your legs.
- <i>I like it. Really good.</i>

14:53.753 --> 14:57.729
<i>- Just stay consistent.
- Yes.</i>

14:57.729 --> 14:58.228
Thank you, ladies.
You look beautiful.

15:00.266 --> 15:00.366
Cody:
<i>We were throwing roses,</i>

15:04.809 --> 15:06.345
<i>pretending to be mad
at each other.</i>

15:06.345 --> 15:08.248
We put on our
acting faces.

15:08.248 --> 15:10.521
Really getting
into character.

15:10.521 --> 15:12.190
Give me the purse!
It isn't yours!

15:12.190 --> 15:14.394
- You're crazy!
- How dare you!

15:14.394 --> 15:16.700
- Give it to me!
- Never!

15:16.700 --> 15:18.101
You sneaky little bitch.

15:20.941 --> 15:24.882
<i>- Give to me!
- Get out!</i>

15:24.882 --> 15:26.753
- Give me the purse!
- Never!

15:26.753 --> 15:29.190
Yeah.

15:31.061 --> 15:33.298
We're hearing
Cody and Marissa

15:33.298 --> 15:35.203
screaming and making
a fool of themselves.

15:35.203 --> 15:37.106
<i>I was like,
"Philipp's gonna be
so disappointed."</i>

15:37.106 --> 15:39.344
<i>- Give it to me!
- No!</i>

15:39.344 --> 15:40.380
It isn't yours!
Give me the purse!

15:40.380 --> 15:42.751
Never.

15:46.191 --> 15:51.268
So, girls,
it's empty here.

15:51.268 --> 15:52.804
- You're not
attracting the people.
- No, they just left.

15:52.804 --> 15:56.378
<i>I am not overly
confident.</i>

15:56.378 --> 15:58.817
Growing up in Gambia,
I was poor,

15:58.817 --> 16:01.321
so living in
a life of luxury
is so different,

16:01.321 --> 16:04.628
<i>and that's why
I'm fighting</i>

16:04.628 --> 16:07.133
is to get rid
of all that nervousness,

16:07.133 --> 16:08.904
to get rid of
all the little insecurities

16:08.904 --> 16:11.308
that tries to
pull me back.

16:11.308 --> 16:12.443
<i>You know,
I'll give you a tip.</i>

16:15.884 --> 16:18.222
You should have
different poses.

16:18.222 --> 16:19.424
Let's make something crazy,
then something strong,

16:19.424 --> 16:21.261
something sad,
something fun.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.510
That looks likea cheap catalog.

16:28.510 --> 16:31.448
It's a high-end
fashion editorial.

16:31.448 --> 16:33.586
- That's it?
- You're not here to sit around.

16:33.586 --> 16:35.958
This is a live
fashion installation.

16:35.958 --> 16:38.663
This is supposedto look like

16:38.663 --> 16:39.197
it was ripped from the
pages of a fashion editorial.

16:42.470 --> 16:46.679
You should have few scenes
to interact with each other.

16:46.679 --> 16:48.482
But now it's actually
already too late.

16:51.923 --> 16:55.296
The room that did the best
is room number...

16:56.699 --> 16:59.037
- Do you understand?
- Yes, I do.

17:01.943 --> 17:03.646
- <i>Or do you
say you understand?</i>
- No.

17:03.646 --> 17:04.816
<i>Because you're
not understanding,</i>

17:04.816 --> 17:05.449
and I keep telling you.

17:23.386 --> 17:25.724
I'm definitely driven
by not being at the top.

17:25.724 --> 17:27.460
<i>My goal is to be
the best at each challenge--
each photo shoot--</i>

17:27.460 --> 17:30.868
because I do have
all the qualities.

17:30.868 --> 17:32.638
I just need to make sure
everyone knows it.

17:32.638 --> 17:34.642
You guys
have the opportunity
to live the high life.

17:34.642 --> 17:37.515
This is what it's like
to be a top model.

17:37.515 --> 17:39.518
This is what it's like
to meet the top of
the fashion industry.

17:39.518 --> 17:41.989
We counted
all the guests votes
including Jason's.

17:41.989 --> 17:46.332
Yeah, some of you did
great, some of you, you know,

17:46.332 --> 17:48.703
I mean, hopefully
you'll use this as
a learning experience.

17:48.703 --> 17:50.574
As I said already, girls,
I'm gonna take the winners

17:50.574 --> 17:54.214
<i>to Madison Avenue
where my store is,</i>

17:54.214 --> 17:55.885
and you can choose
whatever you want.

17:55.885 --> 17:57.754
Paige:
It really sort of sank in
that this

17:57.754 --> 18:00.026
challenge prize
is about to be

18:00.026 --> 18:01.361
thousands of dollars
worth of Philipp Plein clothing.

18:01.361 --> 18:04.601
According to
the votes of the guests,

18:04.601 --> 18:06.338
the room
that did the best
is room number...

18:09.612 --> 18:10.412
- Four.
- ( cheering )

18:14.021 --> 18:15.690
I'm really surprised

18:18.062 --> 18:20.199
because Cody and Marissa
were just screaming things

18:20.199 --> 18:23.072
in the bathroom,
and I just don't think

18:23.072 --> 18:25.677
that that's
elegant and sexy.

18:25.677 --> 18:26.780
You have
worked out something
like a team,

18:26.780 --> 18:28.449
and everybody
could see that.

18:28.449 --> 18:30.253
That was my favorite room.

18:30.253 --> 18:32.524
Cody and I frickin' win,
and it's really exciting

18:32.524 --> 18:35.262
because I was
on the bottom last week,

18:35.262 --> 18:36.766
and I needed to finally
get a win for something.

18:36.766 --> 18:39.203
- Are you excited?
- Both: Yes!

18:39.203 --> 18:41.542
( all laughing )

18:41.542 --> 18:43.045
I will take you now
with me.

18:43.045 --> 18:45.416
- Thank you.
- Bye, guys.

18:45.416 --> 18:49.257
So, ladies,
we travel today in style.

18:49.257 --> 18:50.927
Oh, my God, so we jump
into Philipp Plein's Rolls
Royce.

18:52.396 --> 18:57.040
It's like
something out of a dream.

18:57.040 --> 18:57.373
Philipp:
<i>All right, go.</i>

18:59.645 --> 19:04.287
Everybody can choose
an outfit now.

19:04.287 --> 19:06.559
- Both: Whoo!
- Whatever you want.

19:06.559 --> 19:08.797
Here we are.
As you can see, the store
is still closed.

19:08.797 --> 19:11.770
Being able
to walk up to his
closed store,

19:11.770 --> 19:15.310
have him,
the owner-designer,

19:15.310 --> 19:17.647
<i>friggin' unlock the door,turn
on the lights and tell us,</i>

19:17.647 --> 19:21.254
"Go crazy.
Get whatever you want."

19:21.254 --> 19:23.960
<i>You'll need shoes,
dress, you need a bag,
you need a jacket.</i>

19:23.960 --> 19:27.434
This is really
only happening
in a dreamland

19:27.434 --> 19:30.674
where a woman
can go in a shop

19:30.674 --> 19:31.274
<i>and they can
pick whatever they want.</i>

19:33.478 --> 19:38.489
This is so sick.

19:38.489 --> 19:39.859
All these lines,
all these cuffings
with the zip.

19:39.859 --> 19:43.298
- You like it?
- I love it.
That is so cute.

19:43.298 --> 19:46.105
I feel like something from
"Pretty Woman."

19:46.105 --> 19:48.710
I love it.

19:48.710 --> 19:50.113
But without
the hooker part, okay?

19:50.113 --> 19:51.381
- See you soon.
- And good luck for the show.

19:51.381 --> 19:51.949
- Ciao.
- Thank you. Bye.

19:57.193 --> 20:01.468
Are these
dirty or clean?

20:01.468 --> 20:03.773
- The top part?
- Clean.

20:03.773 --> 20:04.808
Come on, girls.
Rita alert!

20:06.613 --> 20:08.348
Hi, ladies.
Today I'm sending you
to photo shoot

20:11.622 --> 20:13.993
<i>with Philipp Plein in
another luxurious setting.</i>

20:13.993 --> 20:16.131
And this time,
you're either gonna fly right

20:16.131 --> 20:17.835
or risk going home.

20:17.835 --> 20:19.972
Good luck.

20:19.972 --> 20:21.307
Maybe there's a flight
in our future.

20:21.307 --> 20:23.747
<i>Barbados.</i>

20:23.747 --> 20:25.482
Should we all help each other
pack right now?

20:25.482 --> 20:29.491
I feel like I'm just kinda
under the radar right now.

20:29.491 --> 20:31.663
<i>The judges know
that I have star potential,
but I feel like</i>

20:31.663 --> 20:34.034
they're waiting
for me to prove myself
and just wow them.

20:34.034 --> 20:35.302
So I haven't
had that moment yet,
but it's coming.

20:44.555 --> 20:49.497
There's a jet
standing over here
that's amazing,

20:49.497 --> 20:52.571
<i>and we saw
Philipp Plein's clothing,</i>

20:52.571 --> 20:54.373
so I was definitely excited
'cause I love his look.

20:54.373 --> 20:57.881
The bags are so cool,
and the belts.

20:57.881 --> 21:00.352
Courtney: <i>Does
anybody have Benadryl?</i>

21:00.352 --> 21:01.756
- I don't.
- ( sniffles )

21:01.756 --> 21:04.060
Hey, ladies.

21:04.060 --> 21:06.699
Part of living the high
life is riding in style.

21:06.699 --> 21:10.507
Just like Kim and Kanye
or Beyoncé and Jay-Z,

21:10.507 --> 21:13.547
you're gonna be
photographed living the the Lux
life

21:13.547 --> 21:16.351
in this private jet.

21:16.351 --> 21:18.355
So, ladies, you got the
jet, you got the look,

21:18.355 --> 21:19.958
all you're missing
is a hot travel companion
to pose in your shots.

21:24.868 --> 21:28.475
- <i>Jason Derulo.</i>
- ( all screaming )

21:28.475 --> 21:31.716
What's up, ladies?

21:31.716 --> 21:32.885
Paige:
Jason Derulo walks out
of the plane,

21:32.885 --> 21:35.222
and my heart just drops.

21:35.222 --> 21:37.561
Everybody knows
Jason Derulo's songs

21:37.561 --> 21:38.996
so I'm definitely feeling
the pressure a little bit.

21:38.996 --> 21:41.134
I'm a little intimidated.

21:41.134 --> 21:42.838
- Hi, ladies.
- All: Hi.

21:42.838 --> 21:44.875
Today will be a chance for some
of y'all to redeem yourself.

21:44.875 --> 21:47.413
I'm excited.
So I need y'all
to bring your A-game

21:47.413 --> 21:48.816
'cause y'all gotta
make me look good.

21:53.727 --> 21:58.002
All right,
let's start taking pictures.

21:58.002 --> 22:00.406
'Cause time is money.

22:00.406 --> 22:02.443
All right, India,
let's go.

22:02.443 --> 22:04.581
- Get on the plane.
- Thank you.

22:04.581 --> 22:08.155
India:
I've never been on
a private jet.

22:08.155 --> 22:09.525
I've had
the chance a couple times,
but passed it up.

22:09.525 --> 22:12.030
- Okay, Jason.
- Here he comes.

22:12.030 --> 22:14.100
- Hello.
- Hello.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.102
Here we go.
Let's do it.

22:15.102 --> 22:16.739
Give me some attitude.

22:16.739 --> 22:18.342
I want your hair
on the roof.

22:18.342 --> 22:19.444
Yeah, like that, Jason,
that's great.

22:19.444 --> 22:21.481
- ( bleep ).
- Yes.

22:21.481 --> 22:23.953
- Right there.
- That's fabulous.

22:23.953 --> 22:25.289
I have a feeling
that it might be two
best photos in a row.

22:25.289 --> 22:28.763
Drew:
<i>That's it.</i>

22:28.763 --> 22:28.930
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, darlin'.

22:31.636 --> 22:33.873
This is my plane.
He's just a passenger.

22:33.873 --> 22:35.610
- Exactly.
- I'm just--
I'm just here.

22:35.610 --> 22:38.115
All right, Tatiana,
sell this bag.

22:38.115 --> 22:40.453
- Beautiful.
- Arrogant.

22:40.453 --> 22:42.858
Yesterday was a lot rougher
for a lot of the girls,

22:42.858 --> 22:46.231
but, you know,
today I feel like a couple
people changed my mind.

22:46.231 --> 22:49.705
- <i>That's it, right
there.</i> - It was just so
dope

22:49.705 --> 22:51.942
to just be inside
a private jet with Jason.

22:51.942 --> 22:53.680
<i>I definitely went in there
with a boss mentality</i>

22:53.680 --> 22:55.784
- ready to just kill it.
- <i>Okay, great. We're done.</i>

22:55.784 --> 22:58.456
- Are you ready, Coryanne?
- I am.

22:58.456 --> 23:00.359
All right, let's go.

23:00.359 --> 23:01.328
We're shooting you
with the plane

23:01.328 --> 23:02.463
and the Rolls-Royce.

23:02.463 --> 23:03.465
( shutter clicks )

23:05.537 --> 23:07.373
Stronger!
I need you to really
find some tension

23:07.373 --> 23:09.076
<i>in your arms
and your hands.</i>

23:09.076 --> 23:11.014
Am I able to put the bag
down? You want it in my hands?

23:11.014 --> 23:12.183
We have to see the bag.
This is not junior varsity
modeling.

23:12.183 --> 23:16.258
Okay.

23:16.258 --> 23:17.895
I have a lot of anxiety
like all the time

23:17.895 --> 23:19.899
during this competition,
and I'm kind of bummed

23:19.899 --> 23:21.435
<i>that I was just on the stairs
and it was very posed.</i>

23:21.435 --> 23:23.305
<i>There's not
much I could do,</i>

23:23.305 --> 23:24.742
but I wanna be like
on the top again.

23:24.742 --> 23:26.646
<i>Coryanne, it's weak.
It's weak, it's weak!</i>

23:26.646 --> 23:28.248
Stronger! Stronger!
Stronger! Stronger!

23:28.248 --> 23:29.985
You're not, "Ugh,
I'm getting on the plane."

23:29.985 --> 23:31.488
You're, "Ugh!"
Getting on the plane.

23:31.488 --> 23:33.760
Coryanne's struggling
pretty hard.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.262
<i>She doesn't have her head
in the competition.</i>

23:35.262 --> 23:38.202
Come on, it's
the Lux life.

23:38.202 --> 23:39.672
I'm getting on my plane.
I'm leaving everyone behind.

23:39.672 --> 23:41.776
The paparazzi are taking
pictures of me.

23:41.776 --> 23:44.682
I need a sexier shape,
like, yeah.

23:44.682 --> 23:47.955
Well, sort of,not really.

23:47.955 --> 23:49.625
Coryanne, she didn't
really have the special face on
today.

23:49.625 --> 23:52.698
<i>Like, I didn't like
her expression.</i>

23:52.698 --> 23:54.735
- Not so good.
- <i>( shutter clicks )</i>

23:54.735 --> 23:56.506
- Okay, you're done.
- Done!

23:56.506 --> 23:59.176
<i>Hey, that's great!</i>

23:59.176 --> 24:00.513
- Super! It's amazing.
- Move the whole body back.

24:00.513 --> 24:03.185
- That's it.
- I love it.

24:03.185 --> 24:04.353
- Yeah, that's great.
- I love it.

24:04.353 --> 24:05.691
<i>- I love it.
- Beautiful!</i>

24:05.691 --> 24:07.092
- That's done.
- Done, yeah.

24:07.092 --> 24:08.697
Done. You got it perfect.
Beautiful.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.399
- I'm supposed to hold
this? - You gotta work the bag.

24:10.399 --> 24:12.370
You gotta sell product.
You gotta look hot.

24:12.370 --> 24:13.539
- I'm selling it.
- You gotta look like
you're not selling product.

24:13.539 --> 24:14.875
Got it.

24:17.213 --> 24:19.216
Come on, Courtney,
I need more with your leg.

24:19.216 --> 24:20.820
- Like--
- With my leg, okay.

24:20.820 --> 24:22.590
One leg is two steps up.

24:22.590 --> 24:24.126
- Movement!
- Give me a lot of--

24:24.126 --> 24:25.229
This skirt won't
allow me to just--

24:25.229 --> 24:27.500
- Try it!
- Got it.

24:27.500 --> 24:28.970
<i>Again today
Courtney's off.</i>

24:28.970 --> 24:31.241
She was at the high,
high point of the competition,

24:31.241 --> 24:33.712
and now she just kind of
like dwindled off.

24:33.712 --> 24:35.282
<i>That leg should
go higher.</i>

24:35.282 --> 24:36.553
It's the-- the skirt.

24:36.553 --> 24:39.324
Oh, maybe not, okay.

24:39.324 --> 24:40.560
Courtney didn't bring
any energy in the camera,
in the picture.

24:40.560 --> 24:42.396
<i>She didn't add any value.</i>

24:45.001 --> 24:49.077
<i>That's it.</i>

24:49.077 --> 24:50.445
Okay? Okay.

24:50.445 --> 24:51.582
- Hi. Oh, hi.
- Hi, babe.

24:54.989 --> 24:57.594
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

24:57.594 --> 24:59.598
<i>Oh, my God, it was rude!</i>

24:59.598 --> 25:01.000
A 25 year old
cannot behave like that.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.073
<i>Meet and greet.</i>

25:04.073 --> 25:05.476
- Quick fan.
- All good?

25:05.476 --> 25:06.746
I am not feeling confident
that I got the shot.

25:06.746 --> 25:09.483
I don't have anything
to go back to.

25:09.483 --> 25:11.421
Like, this competition
is everything to me,

25:11.421 --> 25:13.926
and we're down
to eight girls.

25:13.926 --> 25:15.697
And that means that I could
be the one going home.

25:15.697 --> 25:19.671
There's no boss initiative
coming out of this photograph.

25:19.671 --> 25:21.942
It's a bit catalog
and not really our campaign.

25:38.374 --> 25:40.881
- It's your first time
on a private jet?
- Yes.

25:40.881 --> 25:43.319
- How we feeling?
- I wanna enter
the mile high club.

25:43.319 --> 25:45.455
I've never been on a P.J.
Private jet.

25:47.828 --> 25:48.529
<i>I was def feeling
a little bit like
Janet Jackson</i>

25:52.302 --> 25:54.708
'cause my boobs
kept popping out,

25:54.708 --> 25:56.144
but I didn't really mind
if Jason got a little peek.

25:56.144 --> 25:58.984
<i>That's nice.
Gorgeous.</i>

25:58.984 --> 26:00.185
( shutter clicking )

26:00.185 --> 26:01.187
This is my man.

26:01.187 --> 26:03.158
No, just joking.

26:03.158 --> 26:04.093
<i>That's nice.</i>

26:05.831 --> 26:07.366
Just like that.
It's beautiful.

26:07.366 --> 26:08.334
<i>Marissa and Cody
won yesterday.</i>

26:08.334 --> 26:10.172
Marissa did well
today again.

26:10.172 --> 26:11.909
<i>She was like,
"This is my jet.</i>

26:11.909 --> 26:13.011
We about to fly
to Maui tonight."

26:13.011 --> 26:15.750
And that was it.

26:15.750 --> 26:17.086
<i>And I think we're good.</i>

26:17.086 --> 26:18.656
- Whoo!
- Thank you, brother.

26:18.656 --> 26:20.693
- Yo, let's go, Jason.
- Sounds good.

26:20.693 --> 26:23.599
Good luck,
good luck.

26:23.599 --> 26:25.168
I feel really great
about living the high life.

26:25.168 --> 26:27.106
I got to ride
in a Rolls-Royce yesterday.

26:27.106 --> 26:29.444
Today being on
a private jet is like--

26:29.444 --> 26:31.281
<i>- it keeps getting
better and better.
- Beautiful.</i>

26:31.281 --> 26:33.118
<i>Nice, long legs.
Love it.</i>

26:33.118 --> 26:34.588
- Beautiful, huh?
- Beautiful, nice.

26:34.588 --> 26:36.425
<i>Okay, we're good.</i>

26:36.425 --> 26:38.596
Let's go!
Are you ready?

26:38.596 --> 26:40.634
Yes, I am ready.

26:40.634 --> 26:42.069
<i>I need to give
these judges good images</i>

26:42.069 --> 26:43.839
so that they don't have
nothing to say about me.

26:43.839 --> 26:48.014
Nothing.

26:48.014 --> 26:49.050
Binta, you gotta
find a very kind of

26:49.050 --> 26:51.555
insanely bitchy attitude.

26:51.555 --> 26:54.460
Okay.

26:54.460 --> 26:56.198
You own it!
You own the place!

26:56.198 --> 26:57.934
<i>I don't want any fear
at all in my heart.</i>

26:57.934 --> 26:59.236
I want to just achieve it
and know that I can do this.

26:59.236 --> 27:03.579
Look sexy and tall.

27:03.579 --> 27:05.315
<i>Go back a little bit, Jason,
so we give her some tension,</i>

27:05.315 --> 27:07.453
<i>give her something
to pull against.</i>

27:07.453 --> 27:08.623
You can lean away from him,
but you get lower, get lower.

27:08.623 --> 27:10.726
- Got it, okay.
- <i>Get lower.</i>

27:10.726 --> 27:12.063
<i>- Lower, lower.
- Start low.</i>

27:12.063 --> 27:13.498
<i>Find a sexy
way to do that.</i>

27:13.498 --> 27:14.635
- <i>That's it,
lean away from him.</i>
- I know.

27:14.635 --> 27:16.638
It's almost boredom.

27:16.638 --> 27:18.877
<i>Jason Derulo is so handsome,
he's got that attitude</i>

27:18.877 --> 27:22.316
that just steals
the frame,

27:22.316 --> 27:24.086
and so you've gotta model
against that.

27:24.086 --> 27:26.090
Grab me and actually
like pull me up and I'll--

27:26.090 --> 27:28.996
But it's nice
when you're leaning away.

27:28.996 --> 27:30.332
Binta, you can hold his hand.

27:30.332 --> 27:31.668
But it's just like
you're in control.

27:31.668 --> 27:33.438
It's not like--

27:33.438 --> 27:35.475
I think Binta
seemed very nervous.

27:35.475 --> 27:37.279
<i>I don't know if it was
all the distractions
of all the things.</i>

27:37.279 --> 27:38.983
She doesn't take us there,
which is a problem.

27:38.983 --> 27:41.421
<i>Lean away from him.</i>

27:41.421 --> 27:42.858
<i>Don't do the neck back
so far. Again!</i>

27:42.858 --> 27:45.196
Binta:
<i>You never know
what the judges</i>

27:45.196 --> 27:46.464
<i>are also thinking
in their head.</i>

27:46.464 --> 27:47.868
<i>Maybe the jacket
is too challenging.</i>

27:47.868 --> 27:50.272
<i>Binta, just work it now.</i>

27:50.272 --> 27:51.274
They could decide
to send me home.

27:51.274 --> 27:53.145
<i>Okay, you're done.</i>

27:53.145 --> 27:54.848
That's a rap, everyone.

27:54.848 --> 27:55.650
<i>Thanks, Jason.</i>

27:59.825 --> 28:04.334
For you, Tati. Right here.

28:04.334 --> 28:06.204
How did you guys
feel about today?

28:06.204 --> 28:08.207
I really don't know
for panel.

28:08.207 --> 28:09.544
The last time I felt good,
and this time I feel good.

28:09.544 --> 28:11.715
I don't know.
But you just never know.

28:11.715 --> 28:13.385
- Yeah.
- <i>Exactly.</i>

28:13.385 --> 28:14.955
Being on the bottomlast
week makes me feel like

28:14.955 --> 28:16.725
any time is my time
at this point.

28:16.725 --> 28:18.729
- <i>I feel you.</i> -
Which scares the ( bleep ) out
of me.

28:18.729 --> 28:21.167
<i>It's just getting down
to the nitty gritty,</i>

28:21.167 --> 28:23.640
and I feel like with me
they never really have
any like direct criticism,

28:23.640 --> 28:26.377
<i>but they don't have
anything extraordinary to
say,</i>

28:26.377 --> 28:28.047
so it's like I'm hoping
that this can be my week.

28:28.047 --> 28:30.018
I need to win.

28:30.018 --> 28:31.053
I need this.

28:36.665 --> 28:41.642
<i>Everybody's like, "No! Cory!
You're confident.</i>

28:41.642 --> 28:44.748
Relax! Don't be
nervous up there."
Yeah, yeah.

28:44.748 --> 28:47.587
<i>Courtney, her and I, really,
really had a hard time</i>

28:47.587 --> 28:50.760
<i>doing the shoot.</i>

28:50.760 --> 28:52.831
<i>So we're all nervous
going into panel,</i>

28:52.831 --> 28:54.935
but I realize that
Courtney's the only person in
the house

28:54.935 --> 28:57.406
I've had like
conflict with.

28:57.406 --> 28:58.175
<i>And I wanted
to talk to her.</i>

28:58.175 --> 29:00.680
I've been wondering.

29:00.680 --> 29:02.049
In a completely
non-insensitive way,

29:02.049 --> 29:06.424
who did you grow up with?

29:06.424 --> 29:08.896
Maybe you guys will get
a better understanding of me.

29:08.896 --> 29:13.740
Me and my mom were
homeless for a year and a half--

29:13.740 --> 29:17.112
a year when I was younger.

29:17.112 --> 29:19.083
And then when I was
seven years old

29:19.083 --> 29:20.920
we got our
first apartment.

29:20.920 --> 29:22.389
<i>And my mom made friends
with the wrong people,</i>

29:22.389 --> 29:24.795
and she was also
a severe hoarder,

29:24.795 --> 29:27.066
- <i>so I had no friends.</i>
- Wow.

29:27.066 --> 29:28.802
<i>Never had anyone over.</i>

29:28.802 --> 29:30.438
<i>For 17 years I had
to wake up every morning</i>

29:30.438 --> 29:34.848
<i>and go to school
and put a smile on my face</i>

29:34.848 --> 29:37.186
<i>and pretend like nothing
at home was happening.</i>

29:37.186 --> 29:41.060
Nobody knew what
was going on with me.

29:41.060 --> 29:43.297
<i>Like I raised myself.
I mean, my mom never
said that she loved me.</i>

29:43.297 --> 29:46.237
<i>I've never heard that
come out of her mouth.</i>

29:46.237 --> 29:48.709
That was my life
for 16 years

29:48.709 --> 29:50.746
till she kicked me
out on the street

29:50.746 --> 29:52.249
with nothing but a suitcase
the size of India's

29:52.249 --> 29:53.953
with a couple
shirts and pants.

29:53.953 --> 29:56.157
<i>Cory.</i>

29:58.662 --> 30:03.405
<i>Oh, Cory.</i>

30:03.405 --> 30:06.210
<i>It was so heavy,
and I couldn't--</i>

30:06.210 --> 30:08.147
It's not something you like,
you would ever read,

30:08.147 --> 30:10.252
if that makes sense.
It's like a real hurt.

30:10.252 --> 30:13.291
And I just couldn't take it.

30:13.291 --> 30:14.127
I was like no one deserves
to be treated like that.

30:14.127 --> 30:16.430
<i>It's unfair.</i>

30:16.430 --> 30:17.900
<i>Everyone needs love.</i>

30:17.900 --> 30:19.270
<i>Oh, Cory.
Come here.</i>

30:19.270 --> 30:21.474
- I feel bad.
- No, no, no, no.
It's okay.

30:21.474 --> 30:25.015
No, no, no.
It's okay.

30:25.015 --> 30:26.818
<i>I want to be
an inspiration</i>

30:26.818 --> 30:28.288
because I didn't have
an inspiration when
I was young.

30:28.288 --> 30:31.629
<i>I'm not just
a pretty face,</i>

30:31.629 --> 30:34.033
and it's time for me
to prove that.

30:34.033 --> 30:34.667
Oh, my God, girl.
It's okay.

30:52.169 --> 30:54.107
Hello, ladies.

30:54.107 --> 30:56.377
This week we gave you
a taste of the high life.

30:56.377 --> 30:57.112

and a private jet,</i>

30:58.816 --> 31:03.358
complete with
a celebrity companion.

31:03.358 --> 31:05.128
Let's say hello
to our amazing judges.

31:05.128 --> 31:07.499
Gorgeous supermodel
and body activist

31:07.499 --> 31:10.271
Ashley Graham.

31:10.271 --> 31:11.341
Our amazing image
architect to the stars, Law
Roach,

31:11.341 --> 31:15.449
and our incredible
creative consultant

31:15.449 --> 31:17.019
and chief creative officer
at "Paper" magazine, Drew
Elliott.

will receive $100,000

31:24.133 --> 31:26.838
<i>and be featured

<i>In addition, the winner

<i>thanks to
"Paper" magazine</i>

31:31.381 --> 31:33.318
<i>and get an exclusive one-year
talent deal with VH1.</i>

31:33.318 --> 31:37.661
First up, Marissa,
I like that you won
the challenge,

31:37.661 --> 31:40.199
since this last week
you were very told off
about your attitude.

31:40.199 --> 31:43.405
So that's a really
nice flip.

31:43.405 --> 31:44.975
- Thank you.
- Wow.

31:44.975 --> 31:46.545
Should we have
a look at your photo?

31:46.545 --> 31:47.814
Ashley:
I never saw you look
more young in a photo.

31:47.814 --> 31:50.386
<i>You look like a baby.</i>

31:50.386 --> 31:51.588
<i>Definitely looks
like a Guess ad.</i>

31:51.588 --> 31:53.191
The '90s were
about excess.

31:53.191 --> 31:56.030
<i>And over the top.
This is so Baby Phat to me.</i>

31:56.030 --> 31:59.571
I love this because
I'm obsessed with Kimora.

31:59.571 --> 32:01.775
- And this is very that
way. - You look like one of her
daughters there.

32:01.775 --> 32:04.013
- Yeah, she does.
- Thank you.

32:04.013 --> 32:06.017
Thank you so
much, Marissa.

32:06.017 --> 32:07.954
<i>India, how are you?</i>

32:07.954 --> 32:09.290
I feel good.
I thought I did a good job,

32:09.290 --> 32:12.029
so I'm excited to see
if it translated.

32:12.029 --> 32:13.966
- Let's have a look.
- Panel: <i>Oh!</i>

32:13.966 --> 32:16.605
- Rita: <i>India!</i>
- Law: Wow.

32:16.605 --> 32:17.874
Rita:
<i>This is the best photo
I've seen of you</i>

32:17.874 --> 32:20.012
<i>in this whole
competition.</i>

32:20.012 --> 32:21.715
This is the fist time
in the competition

32:21.715 --> 32:23.853
that I actually wanna
( bleep ) you.

32:23.853 --> 32:26.190
- Wow!
- <i>You see what I'm saying?</i>

32:26.190 --> 32:28.261
That's what I want.
I want someone to be
best friends with,

32:28.261 --> 32:30.099
that I wanna sleep with,
that I wanna put my make up
and my clothes on to,

32:30.099 --> 32:33.204
and I think Philipp
will agree with me

32:33.204 --> 32:34.708
on saying you're giving
face, honey.

32:34.708 --> 32:37.614
I am very much a person
that is obsessed

32:37.614 --> 32:40.620
with the girls
from the '90s,

32:40.620 --> 32:42.891
<i>and you are giving me
'90s Versace sex,</i>

32:42.891 --> 32:47.667
<i>Claudia Schiffer face.</i>

32:47.667 --> 32:49.771
Pictures like this
and faces like that

32:49.771 --> 32:51.742
is what made me want
to be in fashion.

32:51.742 --> 32:54.581
Rita:
<i>Thank you.</i>

32:54.581 --> 32:56.317
Paige, let's talk
about your photos,
shall we?

32:56.317 --> 32:59.958
<i>I wish you like
extended your leg out.</i>

32:59.958 --> 33:02.664
<i>You could have played
a lot with that dress.</i>

33:02.664 --> 33:05.068
This is the thing, Paige,
I have done this exact
same photo shoot

33:05.068 --> 33:07.440
for my lingerie line,
and I'm a very curvy girl,
so I had to create

33:07.440 --> 33:11.414
<i>so much to go
with this, right?</i>

33:11.414 --> 33:13.418
And to me there's
not really a story

33:13.418 --> 33:16.157
that's been put into this.

33:16.157 --> 33:18.260
And with your body,
with your hair,

33:18.260 --> 33:20.298
<i>with your face,
you have to create
the story,</i>

33:20.298 --> 33:23.104
because the clothes
are always going to be dope.

33:23.104 --> 33:24.908
<i>I think that's the thing
that I don't like about it</i>

33:24.908 --> 33:26.812
is it's a bit catalog
and not really our campaign.

33:26.812 --> 33:31.354
I disagree. I think
the shot is great.

33:31.354 --> 33:33.425
There are a couple of things
you could have done better.

33:33.425 --> 33:35.495
Like, I don't like the way
that you're grabbing the rail
like underhanded.

33:35.495 --> 33:38.835
I think it would have been
a different way for your arm

33:38.835 --> 33:41.508
and your hand to look softer.

33:41.508 --> 33:43.044
But that being said, I do feel
like you're selling things.

33:43.044 --> 33:45.816
I do feel like
you're doing your job

33:45.816 --> 33:47.353
as a model in this photograph.

33:47.353 --> 33:48.556
<i>Thank you, Paige.</i>

33:48.556 --> 33:50.225
Binta.

33:50.225 --> 33:51.862
I just wanna say
I am dying right now.

33:51.862 --> 33:53.832
- Why?
- I really, really
want a good image.

33:53.832 --> 33:56.571
I don't wanna see
anything less.

33:56.571 --> 33:58.709
Let's take a look
at your photo.

33:58.709 --> 34:00.613
<i>A great photo, but it's
not mind-blowing, you know?</i>

34:00.613 --> 34:04.988
It's very similar to last
weekand the week before that.

34:04.988 --> 34:09.965
And this week I really
wanted to see something
different from Binta, you know?

34:09.965 --> 34:13.004
In the photo shoot,
every shot I made sure
I was giving energy.

34:13.004 --> 34:17.313
I really believe every
week you wanna come in

34:17.313 --> 34:19.483
and you wanna grow
and you wanna do better,
but when you get close up,

34:19.483 --> 34:22.322
we see a certain levelof
uncertainty in your face,

34:22.322 --> 34:25.896
and at this point
in the competition,

34:25.896 --> 34:27.733
you shouldn't
have that anymore.

34:27.733 --> 34:28.735
The face close up
is not what I see

34:28.735 --> 34:31.173
when I look at the mirror.

34:31.173 --> 34:33.177
How you see yourself
in the lens

34:33.177 --> 34:34.881
and how you see yourself
in the mirror are two
different things.

34:34.881 --> 34:37.219
I don't think it's us.
I don't think
it's the competition.

34:37.219 --> 34:40.259
I think it's you.

34:40.259 --> 34:42.029
<i>I think you need
to click with yourself</i>

34:42.029 --> 34:43.999
<i>and come back out here
if you make it through</i>

34:43.999 --> 34:46.403
and really figure out
who you are

34:46.403 --> 34:49.109
and what you're
doing here.

34:49.109 --> 34:50.345
You need to find Binta
again because she's missing.

34:50.345 --> 34:52.917
Thank you, Binta.

34:52.917 --> 34:53.952
Next up, Tatiana.

34:56.090 --> 34:58.127
- <i>Hi.</i>
- Hi, guys.

34:58.127 --> 35:00.800
Let's have a look
at your photo.

35:00.800 --> 35:02.704
<i>I'm really happy
about this photo</i>

35:02.704 --> 35:04.908
<i>because you've done good.</i>

35:04.908 --> 35:06.712
Great. Hey, there's
another great shot of Tatiana.

35:06.712 --> 35:08.583
This is just taking it
to another level.

35:08.583 --> 35:11.053
This, you killed it.

35:11.053 --> 35:12.189
<i>You are definitely
representing the high life.</i>

35:12.189 --> 35:14.894
I believe that
that's your man.

35:14.894 --> 35:17.366
<i>You guys
are on the way to Ibiza,
or something fabulous.</i>

35:17.366 --> 35:18.902
<i>You just spent a
couplehundred thousand dollarsn
clothes.</i>

35:18.902 --> 35:21.441
Like,
this is the high life.

35:21.441 --> 35:23.144
- This is what
this week was about.
- Good job.

35:23.144 --> 35:24.213
- <i>You killed it.</i>
- Thank you.

35:24.213 --> 35:27.419
Coryanne.

35:27.419 --> 35:29.156
Let's see if this week
can top last week.

35:29.156 --> 35:31.962
<i>It doesn't look
like your plane.</i>

35:31.962 --> 35:34.400
<i>It looks like Jason's
come off the plane</i>

35:34.400 --> 35:37.206
and you are a really hot
air hostess.

35:37.206 --> 35:39.578
I feel as if there's
no boss initiative

35:39.578 --> 35:42.149
coming out of
this photograph.

35:42.149 --> 35:43.552
<i>I wanna like this photo.
I just think you look
a little stiff.</i>

35:43.552 --> 35:46.825
I just see like,
"I'm a model."

35:46.825 --> 35:49.664
Because the thing is
you have it in you,

35:49.664 --> 35:50.733
but in this photo
you didn't.

35:50.733 --> 35:52.236
Thank you, Coryanne.

35:52.236 --> 35:54.139
Cody, congratulations
on winning the challenge.

35:54.139 --> 35:56.511
Whoo!

35:56.511 --> 35:58.749
Did you get this coat there?

35:58.749 --> 36:00.251
- I wanted a leather jacket
so bad, and I just--
- <i>Aww.</i>

36:00.251 --> 36:03.090
I'm just so happy
that I got one.

36:03.090 --> 36:04.527
Thank you, Philipp.
Thank you. Call me later.

36:04.527 --> 36:07.299
I'm gonna borrow
that jacket.

36:07.299 --> 36:09.336
<i>Should we look
at your photo?</i>

36:09.336 --> 36:10.773
<i>- I love it.
You look beautiful.
- Thank you.</i>

36:10.773 --> 36:13.645
Your body language
is amazing.

36:13.645 --> 36:15.583
You are the only one
that looks like

36:15.583 --> 36:17.285
<i>they've been on
a private jet before.</i>

36:17.285 --> 36:19.758
You're pretty
but you're effortless,

36:19.758 --> 36:21.294
and you're kind of here
based on the message like,

36:21.294 --> 36:23.632
"This is my plane.
Remember that."

36:23.632 --> 36:25.168
- Thank you, Cody.
- Thank you, guys.

36:25.168 --> 36:26.671
Courtney, let's get
to the photo.

36:26.671 --> 36:28.775
- <i>Okay.</i>
- All right.

36:28.775 --> 36:30.980
<i>Oh, that's really not doing
anything for you, is it?</i>

36:30.980 --> 36:34.119
I had like really
bad allergies,

36:34.119 --> 36:36.625
- so I was a little
sniffly on the set.
- Oh, girl.

36:36.625 --> 36:39.196
- <i>Did this really just
happen? No, you didn't.</i> -
What?

36:39.196 --> 36:41.835
You said allergies?
No! I thought we weren't
complaining anymore.

36:41.835 --> 36:46.044
It's like Courtney
the complainer is back.

36:46.044 --> 36:48.447
A boss would own this.
I'm done babying you,

36:48.447 --> 36:50.886
<i>and I know that we have
this conversation almost
every week.</i>

36:50.886 --> 36:53.458
You're great.
I think you're pretty,

36:53.458 --> 36:55.796
<i>but it's like between
the allergies</i>

36:55.796 --> 36:57.499
and the complaints,
and the babying

36:57.499 --> 36:59.637
<i>and all that stuff,
you are just,</i>

36:59.637 --> 37:01.173
again, count yourself out.

37:02.577 --> 37:04.647
- Do you know how much
this costs?
- Yes.

37:07.554 --> 37:10.024
- To bring Jason Derulo
to you?
- <i>No, of course.</i>

37:10.024 --> 37:12.328
To bring a Rolls-Royce
to you?

37:12.328 --> 37:13.999
- Do you know how much
it costs?
- No, of course.

37:13.999 --> 37:16.237
And I think all of you
struggle with this.

37:16.237 --> 37:17.707
<i>This is really expensive.
And so when you show up</i>

37:17.707 --> 37:20.546
and you have allergies,
and you have a bad day,

37:20.546 --> 37:22.984
what am I supposed to do?
Throw it away?

37:22.984 --> 37:24.988
<i>If you were that person
that did that,</i>

37:24.988 --> 37:26.758
<i>I would never
have you back again.</i>

37:26.758 --> 37:28.160
And let me tell you,
I have a lot of friends.

37:28.160 --> 37:31.735
They wouldn't
have you back either.

37:31.735 --> 37:33.605
- No, I-- totally understand.
- <i>It's like, come on.</i>

37:33.605 --> 37:35.275
- Do you? Do you
understand? - Yes, I do.

37:35.275 --> 37:37.012
<i>Or do you say
you understand?</i>

37:37.012 --> 37:38.849
- No.
- Because you're not
understanding,

37:38.849 --> 37:40.051
and I keep telling you,
and you're gonna understand.

37:40.051 --> 37:44.193
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

37:44.193 --> 37:46.463
Okay, models,
now it's time
for us to decide

37:46.463 --> 37:48.869
<i>who will be getting
best photo</i>

37:48.869 --> 37:49.269
<i>and who will

38:10.947 --> 38:13.084
Models, welcome back.
The judges have deliberated.

38:13.084 --> 38:16.792
<i>If I call your name,
you'll be staying
another week</i>

38:16.792 --> 38:19.429
to prove you have
what it takes to be
the next top model.

38:19.429 --> 38:21.968
The person who is getting

38:30.252 --> 38:34.927

38:34.927 --> 38:37.299

38:57.306 --> 38:59.276
<i>I only have three
spots left.</i>

39:15.274 --> 39:15.374
Will Courtney and Binta
please step forward?

39:20.385 --> 39:21.955
When we first started
this competition,

39:25.161 --> 39:28.535
you two models
were the girls to beat.

39:28.535 --> 39:32.141
Binta, we know you're
amazing. We need you to know
that.

39:32.141 --> 39:36.651
You have a beautiful face,
but for the last few weeks,

39:36.651 --> 39:41.160
we haven't seen it in photos.

39:41.160 --> 39:43.230
<i>The judges worry
that your insecurities</i>

39:43.230 --> 39:45.501
<i>have gotten the best of you
in this competition.</i>

39:45.501 --> 39:47.507
Courtney, it's clear
that the camera loves you.

39:47.507 --> 39:52.015
Week after week,
your face delivers,

39:52.015 --> 39:55.488
<i>but this competition
is more than just being
a pretty face.</i>

39:55.488 --> 39:58.662
At this point, you should
be getting better and better.

39:58.662 --> 40:02.837
Not worse.

40:02.837 --> 40:04.540
Who is gonna stay?

40:06.911 --> 40:11.654
<i>Courtney.</i>

40:11.654 --> 40:12.523
- <i>Congratulations.</i>
- Thank you.

40:15.529 --> 40:16.865
You made it another week,
and you still have the chance

40:16.865 --> 40:20.038
to become next top model.

40:20.038 --> 40:20.839
- I'm so sorry, Binta.
- I appreciate it.

40:23.278 --> 40:25.047
You have to remember
what I said, okay?

40:25.047 --> 40:27.452
Yeah, thank you.

40:27.452 --> 40:28.888
Came in here believing
that I have it all,

40:28.888 --> 40:31.227
and I couldn't
show it in photos,

40:31.227 --> 40:34.968
<i>and that is my struggle.</i>

40:34.968 --> 40:38.876
<i>I would do it again
if I could.</i>

40:38.876 --> 40:40.378
<i>There's a lot of people
that would like to be
in my position.</i>

40:40.378 --> 40:43.585
<i>I'm grateful for it.
I'm thankful for it.</i>

40:43.585 --> 40:47.560
Bye, Binta.

40:47.560 --> 40:48.795
<i>I will be a
successful model.</i>

40:48.795 --> 40:49.396
It will happen.
It's part of me.

40:59.551 --> 41:01.154
This week you're going
to be part of an ensemble.

41:01.154 --> 41:02.488
India:
Oh, my God!

41:03.992 --> 41:06.297

41:06.297 --> 41:07.933
Rita:
We're creating
a full music video.

41:07.933 --> 41:10.238
Please help me introduce
French Montana.

41:10.238 --> 41:14.547
Drew:
Marissa, it's your moment.

41:14.547 --> 41:15.883
- ( bleep ) to you too.
- Turn it around.

41:15.883 --> 41:18.121
Rita:
You have such a great look,

41:18.121 --> 41:19.824
but do you want
to be here, right now?

41:19.824 --> 41:20.993
Because I kind of feel
like you don't.

41:20.993 --> 41:23.297
I want this spot so bad.

41:23.297 --> 41:25.836
Woman:
Again. Come on. Come on.

41:25.836 --> 41:26.805
Last one, make it
count.nCome on!

41:26.805 --> 41:29.008
<i>( sirens wail )</i>

41:30.311 --> 41:31.179
<i>We see your beauty.</i>
