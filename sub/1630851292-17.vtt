Well, I was onto you, so...

19:10.299 --> 19:11.816
That's not why. (yelps)

19:11.967 --> 19:13.634
And you were gonna marry her?

19:13.728 --> 19:15.060
I'm sorry, Lois.

19:15.213 --> 19:16.970
The only things I liked
about Alana

19:17.064 --> 19:18.805
was the stuff
she stole from you.

19:18.825 --> 19:22.326
But who needs her when I got
the genuine article right here?

19:22.478 --> 19:24.811
I guess what I'm trying
to say is:

19:24.831 --> 19:26.889
What's for dinner?

19:26.982 --> 19:28.833
Oh, Peter.

Thanks for agreeing

20:03.203 --> 20:04.851
Mm-hmm. Get on with it.

20:04.946 --> 20:07.205
What I did was unforgivable.

20:07.432 --> 20:09.432
I've had a lot of time
to think about things.

20:09.434 --> 20:11.209
You have nothing but time
in prison.

-Really?
-I know it sounds crazy,

20:13.438 --> 20:15.529

running to wake me up
at 6:00 in the morning.

20:17.866 --> 20:19.217
Wh-When do you wake up?

20:19.444 --> 20:21.444
I don't know,
whenever they serve breakfast.

20:21.462 --> 20:23.279
"They"? "Serve"?

20:23.297 --> 20:26.131
I guess you don't have to cook
for yourself in here, huh?

20:26.226 --> 20:28.075
You're not allowed to.

20:28.152 --> 20:29.301
I want to switch.

Wrap it up, ladies.

Inmate, you're gonna be late

Knitting class? What stitch?

20:35.643 --> 20:37.050
All of them, I guess?

20:37.144 --> 20:40.571
I want to switch.
