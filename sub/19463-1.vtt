<i>Jonathan Brisby was killed today
while helping with the Plan.</i>

01:18.003 --> 01:22.439
<i>It is four years
since our departure from NIMH</i>

01:23.664 --> 01:25.841
<i>and our world is changing.</i>

01:27.564 --> 01:30.273
<i>We cannot stay here much longer.</i>

01:32.465 --> 01:35.607
<i>Jonathan was a dear friend.</i>

01:37.485 --> 01:41.069
<i>I am lost in knowing
how to help his widow.</i>

01:43.287 --> 01:47.599
<i>She knows nothing of us, or the Plan.</i>

01:52.385 --> 01:55.682
<i>Perhaps best that I do
nothing at present.</i>

01:58.253 --> 01:59.992
<i>I shall miss him.</i>

02:05.517 --> 02:06.922
<i>Johnason.</i>

02:07.740 --> 02:09.696
<i>Wherever you are.</i>

02:10.318 --> 02:13.505
<i>Your thoughts must comfort her tonight.</i>

02:14.936 --> 02:20.073
<i>She'll be waiting,
and you will not return.</i>

02:32.170 --> 02:37.564
<i>Farewell... my friend.</i>

04:00.092 --> 04:01.620
Mr. Ages?

04:03.684 --> 04:07.466
Mr. Ages, is anybody home?

04:07.677 --> 04:09.288
Go away!

04:11.087 --> 04:12.413
Mr. Ages!

04:12.719 --> 04:14.630
What is it?

04:15.369 --> 04:18.230
Mr. Ages, may I please speak to you?

04:18.231 --> 04:19.232
What?

04:19.233 --> 04:22.257
I said, may I please speak...

04:23.319 --> 04:24.600
with you.

04:24.953 --> 04:26.840
Oh, thank goodness

04:27.403 --> 04:28.758
I'm so glad you're home.

04:30.376 --> 04:32.134
Confounded machine!

04:32.298 --> 04:34.471
You never know when
it's going to up and blow!

04:34.506 --> 04:35.521
Yes.

04:35.679 --> 04:37.603
I don't suppose you would remember me..

04:38.292 --> 04:39.988
Yes, you're Mrs. Brisby.

04:40.296 --> 04:42.493
And I am sorry
about your husband's death.

04:42.793 --> 04:44.687
Now if you'll excuse me...

04:44.772 --> 04:46.308
Mr. Ages!

04:46.343 --> 04:48.537
Great Jupiter woman, what do you want?

04:48.572 --> 04:50.732
Mr. Ages, I know you don't like visitors

04:50.812 --> 04:52.380
but this is an emergency!

04:52.415 --> 04:54.079
Please!

05:03.267 --> 05:07.741
Madam, that is an emergency.

05:08.276 --> 05:11.213
Oh Mr. Ages, my son Timothy is so sick!

05:11.214 --> 05:13.798
Timmy? The one with the spider bite?

05:14.682 --> 05:17.494
Oh, just give him
some pepsissiwa root and...

05:17.495 --> 05:18.683
No!

05:18.761 --> 05:20.288
No, he's sick with a fever!

05:21.028 --> 05:23.899
Well... I suppose I could
fix up something...

05:24.000 --> 05:24.780
Oh thank you!

05:24.781 --> 05:27.058
Follow me, but don't touch anything!

05:27.093 --> 05:28.370
Understand?

05:30.184 --> 05:31.342
I do appreciate it...

05:31.377 --> 05:32.815
Just how high is his fever?

05:32.850 --> 05:34.254
He's burning hot to the touch.

05:34.802 --> 05:35.430
Yes.

05:35.465 --> 05:37.145
He's soaking wet with perspiration...

05:37.180 --> 05:37.626
Yes?

05:37.661 --> 05:39.712
And there's a raspy
sound when he breathes.

05:39.747 --> 05:42.253
A raspy sound you say? Well..

05:45.232 --> 05:46.679
Does he have a chill?

05:46.714 --> 05:47.864
Yes, he does.

05:48.290 --> 05:49.609
Have you wrapped him in a blanket?

05:49.644 --> 05:50.794
Yes.

05:51.070 --> 05:53.096
Now step inside, but keep
your hands to yourself!

05:54.090 --> 05:57.183
I'm right in the middle of...
something very important.

05:57.218 --> 05:58.049
I understand.

05:58.084 --> 05:59.234
Oh, do you?

06:02.259 --> 06:03.820
Look at this mess...

06:04.415 --> 06:05.723
Oh, shoo, shoo, go on!

06:07.652 --> 06:10.375
- Your son has pneumonia.
- Pneumonia?

06:10.410 --> 06:13.111
It's not uncommon,
but you can die from it.

06:13.843 --> 06:14.873
Oh please dear God, no.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.810
Your son must stay in bed.
Bundle him up.

06:17.845 --> 06:18.995
Yes.

06:21.910 --> 06:24.088
- Not to go outside...
- But how long must...

06:24.123 --> 06:25.273
Three weeks.

06:26.392 --> 06:28.806
He cannot be moved
for at least three weeks.

06:28.841 --> 06:30.418
But Moving Day is nearly here!

06:30.719 --> 06:34.320
- You asked my advice, and I gave it to you!
- I'm sorry.

06:34.355 --> 06:35.547
He must stay in bed.

06:36.030 --> 06:40.220
Now, mix this... this powder
in a broth and make him drink it.

06:40.221 --> 06:41.442
It'll bring down the fever.

06:41.477 --> 06:42.453
Oh, bless you sir!

06:42.488 --> 06:43.914
And bless yourself, you'll need it.

06:45.863 --> 06:47.511
Now, you must excuse me...

06:47.546 --> 06:48.675
You know the way out.

06:48.710 --> 06:50.084
Oh, of course.

06:50.119 --> 06:51.441
Thank you once again...

06:51.476 --> 06:53.808
Shoo shoo shoo. Go on now. Go on.

06:54.261 --> 06:55.411
Thank you so...

06:55.720 --> 06:59.615
much. Goodbye.

07:29.211 --> 07:31.692
Is everything all right here?

07:31.693 --> 07:35.281
What the... Oh! Lady, don't
sneak up on me like that!

07:35.693 --> 07:37.506
I didn't mean to frighten you...

07:38.025 --> 07:41.711
Oh, you didn't frighten
me, I was just sort of...

07:41.712 --> 07:43.038
working out.

07:43.638 --> 07:45.581
You just broke
my concentration, that's...

07:45.582 --> 07:47.581
You look more like you're
all tangled up.

07:48.522 --> 07:49.476
Er, yeah

07:49.511 --> 07:51.555
I guess that's enough exercise
for one day.

07:51.556 --> 07:55.176
Besides, I'm really
after this terrific string!

07:55.211 --> 07:57.336
I'm working on a love nest for two.

07:57.337 --> 07:58.710
You know what I mean?

07:58.711 --> 08:00.694
Oh I see...

08:00.695 --> 08:02.057
you have a girl.

08:02.058 --> 08:03.743
Well, not really, I mean...

08:03.778 --> 08:05.429
I haven't found Miss Right yet.

08:05.729 --> 08:06.660
But when I do

08:06.695 --> 08:11.084
the whole world will hear us singing...

08:14.539 --> 08:15.706
Excuse me, pardon me.

08:16.839 --> 08:20.274
Well, you keep making all that noise
and Dragon will hear you.

08:20.275 --> 08:21.688
If he hasn't already.

08:21.689 --> 08:23.483
Wouldn't you sing too? I mean

08:23.939 --> 08:25.523
if you felt... heh heh...

08:26.252 --> 08:28.506
if you felt the call of the wild, but...

08:28.507 --> 08:30.462
I would... I would not

08:30.697 --> 08:32.405
if I knew there was a cat nearby.

08:33.924 --> 08:34.866
But..

08:34.892 --> 08:37.145
But SHE'S out there... somewhere...

08:37.179 --> 08:41.758
and when I find her I'll feel
it way down in my wishbone!

08:41.759 --> 08:42.929
I... What cat?

08:42.931 --> 08:46.032
Dragon! He belongs
to Farmer Fitzgibbons.

08:46.472 --> 08:49.911
Look towards the house. See
if you can see him.

08:49.912 --> 08:54.523
Come back down here!

08:54.524 --> 08:56.328
He'll see you for sure up there!

08:56.329 --> 08:58.758
Hey, there's a cat out there!

08:58.759 --> 09:01.099
Quiet! Does he see you?

09:01.544 --> 09:02.694
No.

09:03.248 --> 09:04.318
Yes!

09:04.319 --> 09:06.674
Stand perfectly still.

09:06.675 --> 09:09.818
Everything's fine...
he's headed right for us.

09:09.819 --> 09:12.003
Don't panic! Fast or slow?

09:12.004 --> 09:15.568
Medium. Make that fast. Very f...

09:15.569 --> 09:18.259
I have to go now! Excuse me, I really...

09:25.231 --> 09:26.381
Break!

09:34.453 --> 09:36.030
Oh my goodness.

09:46.073 --> 09:47.564
It's a rabbit!

09:48.703 --> 09:51.807
Well of all the silly nincompoops!

09:51.808 --> 09:55.775
You got yourself all worked
up over a rabbit!

09:56.609 --> 09:58.763
You should have seen yourself!

09:58.764 --> 10:00.308
Will you keep quiet?

10:00.309 --> 10:02.565
You were scared stiff!

10:02.566 --> 10:04.859
A rabbit! I knew it all along!

10:06.098 --> 10:07.473
Will you hush up?

10:08.713 --> 10:10.704
Admit it! You were scared!

10:10.705 --> 10:13.924
Oh... fiddlesticks. Hold still.

10:13.925 --> 10:17.679
If I had actually been near a cat,
I'd be sneezing my brains out.

10:17.680 --> 10:19.471
See, I'm allergic to ca...

10:19.506 --> 10:21.263
I'm allergic to caaaaa...

10:21.264 --> 10:23.013
I'm allergic to caaaaa...

10:28.706 --> 10:32.623
I'm allerg... AHHH-CHOOOO!

10:33.106 --> 10:35.042
Excuse me, pardon me.

11:12.509 --> 11:14.663
The string, quick! Grab the string!

12:06.507 --> 12:09.513
Hey, Miss Mouse, don't worry, I'm ok.

12:13.497 --> 12:14.514
See? I'm alright.

12:14.515 --> 12:16.693
That's not the reason I'm crying.

12:17.595 --> 12:19.471
I lost Timmy's medicine.

12:19.472 --> 12:23.211
Aw, don't cry. I hate
to see a woman cry...

12:24.042 --> 12:27.391
Hey! Was I great, or was I
great? Did you see that cat out there?

12:27.392 --> 12:31.691
All dripping, and... and wet...
with water...

12:31.692 --> 12:37.020
I'll... go back to Mr. Ages
tommorow, and...

12:37.021 --> 12:38.021
You weren't so bad yourself.

12:38.253 --> 12:40.137
Hey, we make a pretty good team!

12:40.172 --> 12:41.993
Oh, here, you dropped this back there.

12:41.994 --> 12:45.001
Nobody messes with ol' Jeremy, boy.
Nobody!

12:45.002 --> 12:48.614
That's it! Timmy's medicine!

12:48.615 --> 12:52.335
Oh, thank you! Thank you so much!

12:52.812 --> 12:56.938
Huh? It i... what? It is? I mean, it is.

12:56.973 --> 12:59.501
Well, I saw it lying
there, and I said uh...

13:02.329 --> 13:03.779
My name is Jeremy.

13:04.734 --> 13:06.010
I'm Mrs. Brisby.

13:06.011 --> 13:07.161
Thanks again!

13:07.750 --> 13:09.629
I have to go home now.

13:11.404 --> 13:12.907
Uh, where's home?

13:13.008 --> 13:16.177
In the garden patch, by the stone.

13:18.107 --> 13:19.507
Do you like me?

13:19.508 --> 13:21.950
Of course I like you!

13:21.951 --> 13:22.909
Bye now.

13:22.910 --> 13:25.680
No! I mean... I mean, um... I mean

13:25.715 --> 13:27.761
you don't think I'm clumsy or anything?

13:29.951 --> 13:32.242
Oh... sorry. Excuse me, pardon me.

13:34.233 --> 13:37.519
Oh. Well, if you're
going to feather a nest

13:37.785 --> 13:40.525
you've got a lot to learn
about how to treat a lady!

13:40.526 --> 13:42.968
Right. When you're right, you're right.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.475
And you're right.

13:45.152 --> 13:47.290
None of the girls I meet
want to get serious!

13:47.555 --> 13:49.466
I doubt they'd survive.

13:49.819 --> 13:52.385
Huh? Maybe it's my approach.

13:52.386 --> 13:54.686
Say! You were a girl once!

13:54.687 --> 13:56.446
You could teach me how to...

13:56.447 --> 13:57.291
you know, how to...

13:57.292 --> 13:58.731
Behave yourself?

13:59.153 --> 14:00.694
I'm not that bad!

14:00.695 --> 14:03.850
I just need a few pointers
to polish my style.

14:05.125 --> 14:07.979
Jeremy, I have got to go home!

14:07.980 --> 14:10.318
Well let me... Let me fly you home!

14:10.319 --> 14:11.597
We can talk on the way!

14:11.598 --> 14:15.803
Oh, no thank you. I'm afraid of heights.

14:15.804 --> 14:17.321
OK, then we'll walk.

14:18.726 --> 14:19.876
Bye now.

14:33.191 --> 14:34.511
I think I got real potential

14:34.512 --> 14:36.848
I mean, girls go for the athletic
type, don't they?

14:36.916 --> 14:39.073
Jeremy, you're stepping on my tail.

14:40.414 --> 14:42.020
Excuse me, pardon me...

14:48.617 --> 14:50.410
Maybe I should go look for Mom.

14:50.744 --> 14:52.662
I don't think so, Martin.

14:52.663 --> 14:56.046
Brisby! Briiiiiisby!

14:56.047 --> 14:58.095
Oh! Auntie Shrew!

14:58.096 --> 14:59.459
Oh Auntie!

14:59.460 --> 15:00.784
Oh no...

15:01.458 --> 15:03.310
She'll wake up Timothy!

15:05.576 --> 15:06.903
She's not here.

15:08.918 --> 15:12.945
Why is she always coming around here,
poking her nose in where she's not wanted?

15:12.946 --> 15:14.457
Martin!

15:18.783 --> 15:22.569
Thank you child. I must
speak with your mother.

15:24.959 --> 15:27.104
Your Auntie is exhausted!

15:27.828 --> 15:29.405
Why me?

15:29.455 --> 15:31.676
That I alone should
be responsible

15:31.727 --> 15:35.996
for the welfare of the entire
field is monstrous!

15:36.148 --> 15:37.808
Brisby!

15:37.809 --> 15:39.041
Mother isn't here.

15:39.042 --> 15:41.836
Auntie Shrew, Timmy's sick!

15:41.837 --> 15:44.953
Cynthia dearest, don't pull me.

15:46.060 --> 15:47.583
She's not here?

15:48.092 --> 15:50.253
She left you children alone then?

15:50.254 --> 15:51.439
I'm old enough.

15:51.440 --> 15:54.926
Rats in the field up to heaven
knows what sort of mischief...

15:54.927 --> 15:57.096
Cynthia dear, don't fidgit!

15:57.097 --> 15:58.799
You're so like your mother!

15:58.800 --> 16:00.359
I ain't scared of nuthin!

16:00.360 --> 16:02.483
She went to see Mr. Ages.

16:02.484 --> 16:05.392
To Ages? That old flim-flam!

16:05.393 --> 16:06.415
Whatever for?

16:06.416 --> 16:08.428
Auntie Shrew, Timmy's sick!

16:08.429 --> 16:10.316
Patience, my pet.

16:10.317 --> 16:12.186
Why to Ages?

16:12.187 --> 16:14.847
- Timmy's sick!
- Timothy is very ill.

16:14.848 --> 16:17.507
Timmy ill? How dreadful!

16:17.508 --> 16:19.736
I'm not afraid of the dark!

16:19.771 --> 16:21.964
I'm not afraid of the farmer!

16:21.965 --> 16:22.926
I can't hear!

16:22.927 --> 16:24.589
I'm not even scared of Dragon.

16:25.156 --> 16:28.450
I'm not even afraid of...
of... of the Great Owl!

16:28.451 --> 16:30.491
- Will you hush up?
- Aw, you hush up!

16:30.492 --> 16:31.293
Martin!

16:31.294 --> 16:32.577
Precocious monster!

16:32.578 --> 16:34.086
Bossing bullfrog!

16:34.087 --> 16:35.652
Spoiled brat!

16:35.653 --> 16:36.925
Loudmouth!

16:39.363 --> 16:42.440
That will be quite enough, thank you!

16:46.082 --> 16:50.180
Cast not pearls before swine,
I always say...

16:50.215 --> 16:55.040
and that includes impudent piglets!
Good day!

16:59.869 --> 17:02.430
Oh! You impertinent little...

17:02.431 --> 17:05.380
Martin! Auntie Shrew, what's going on!?

17:05.381 --> 17:06.452
Indeed!

17:06.453 --> 17:08.869
Please... come back inside...

17:08.871 --> 17:10.558
Not for a king's ransom!

17:10.559 --> 17:12.502
I have just one thing to say.

17:12.503 --> 17:14.621
That child is a brat!

17:14.622 --> 17:16.470
Yes, I will speak to him.

17:16.471 --> 17:18.196
I came here to inform you...

17:18.198 --> 17:20.184
that the frost is off the ground...

17:20.185 --> 17:22.243
and Moving Day is at hand.

17:22.590 --> 17:26.983
Prepare to move your very
very odd family.

17:26.983 --> 17:28.501
Good day.

17:28.502 --> 17:32.413
You never know what might
be lurking about out here

17:32.414 --> 17:34.083
what with rats and...

17:34.084 --> 17:37.164
Well, children. Now you've done it.

17:37.265 --> 17:38.415
It was Martin.

17:38.870 --> 17:40.920
The Shrew means well.

17:40.921 --> 17:42.624
She only wants to help.

17:55.871 --> 17:57.638
Gosh, I'm sorry, Mom.

19:05.251 --> 19:07.231
Is Timmy gonna die?

19:07.232 --> 19:10.708
No, sweetheart. He's just very sick.

19:10.709 --> 19:12.561
What's the matter with him, Mother?

19:12.562 --> 19:15.929
Mr. Ages called it... pneumonia.

19:15.930 --> 19:17.080
Pneumonia?

19:18.478 --> 19:20.436
When will he get better?

19:20.437 --> 19:23.682
Soon... I hope.

19:50.615 --> 19:52.289
Off to bed with you now.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.573
Dear, a man came by today, from NIMH.

20:10.794 --> 20:12.749
- NIMH?
- Yes, you know!

20:12.796 --> 20:15.108
The National Institute of Mental Health.

20:15.741 --> 20:17.549
He was asking if we had noticed...

20:17.584 --> 20:20.385
anything strange...
about the rats on the farm.

20:21.180 --> 20:23.338
Well, I said "No, nothing unusual".

20:23.339 --> 20:26.148
Beth, I have to get up early.

20:26.149 --> 20:28.894
Oh, it gave me goosebumps
to hear him carry on that way!

20:28.929 --> 20:31.495
Like the rats might have
some horrible disease!

20:31.496 --> 20:32.538
Night, Beth...

20:32.573 --> 20:34.534
I told him you'd call him back.

21:22.934 --> 21:26.128
What did I tell you? Moving!

21:26.129 --> 21:28.334
- It can't be!
- It certainly can!

21:28.369 --> 21:30.377
I don't suppose you've packed!

21:30.535 --> 21:31.815
What about Timmy?

21:32.873 --> 21:34.235
The chill in the air could kill him!

21:34.270 --> 21:36.896
Well child, that tractor surely will.

21:36.931 --> 21:40.156
For the last time, get
your children out of here

21:40.167 --> 21:42.286
before it's too late!

21:48.257 --> 21:52.845
Run! The plow is here, run!

21:53.156 --> 21:55.308
It's Moving Day!

22:01.221 --> 22:02.204
Run!

22:02.308 --> 22:03.664
The plow is here!

22:04.689 --> 22:06.042
Run!

22:17.409 --> 22:19.438
Run! Get out!

22:38.758 --> 22:39.908
Brisby!

22:41.762 --> 22:42.848
Go get... Timothy!

22:42.849 --> 22:44.996
Please! Take the children out of here!

22:44.997 --> 22:46.145
Mommy, we can't leave Timmy!

22:46.146 --> 22:47.587
Go with Auntie Shrew.

22:47.622 --> 22:49.787
I've got to try to stop that thing!

22:49.845 --> 22:52.517
Wait! You're out of your mind!

22:52.518 --> 22:54.717
Brisby, come back!

23:20.996 --> 23:23.527
Brisby! Hang on!

23:23.528 --> 23:24.811
Hang on!

24:03.742 --> 24:04.915
Brisby!

24:07.999 --> 24:09.538
Come on! Come on!

24:16.267 --> 24:17.752
Well of all the rotten luck...

24:18.434 --> 24:19.759
fuel line's cut.

24:19.760 --> 24:21.627
He'll come back tomorrow...

24:22.495 --> 24:24.770
I wish Jonathan were here.

24:25.687 --> 24:26.889
Well, he's not.

24:29.546 --> 24:30.696
Stop it!

24:33.792 --> 24:35.448
What am I going to do?

24:35.740 --> 24:37.676
We'll think of something.

24:38.217 --> 24:40.496
Come on, let's get out of here.

24:45.842 --> 24:49.626
The Great Owl would know
what to do about this.

24:50.054 --> 24:51.338
You must go see him.

24:51.913 --> 24:52.956
Oh I... I couldn't do that.

24:52.990 --> 24:54.774
Owls eat mice!

24:55.074 --> 24:58.087
Well my child, show a little courage!

24:58.122 --> 25:00.453
We're fighting for Timmy's life!

25:01.960 --> 25:07.864
Jonathan, your wife, I fear
Is in desperate trouble.

25:09.238 --> 25:13.267
A visit to the Great Owl
may indeed be profitable.

25:15.424 --> 25:18.509
Go to the Owl then, Mrs. Brisby.

25:21.283 --> 25:22.647
Go there!

25:36.435 --> 25:37.565
Nice evening huh?

25:37.566 --> 25:39.336
I told you you'd love flying.

25:39.337 --> 25:42.133
I don't know how
I let you talk me into this!

25:42.181 --> 25:44.175
Aw, don't thank me, Mrs. Briz.

25:47.213 --> 25:48.367
When we get to the Great Owl

25:48.368 --> 25:51.164
he'll know just what to
do about everything!

25:51.165 --> 25:53.275
Owls eat mice!

25:53.276 --> 25:56.646
Ummmm... only after dark...

26:27.204 --> 26:30.132
That must be the Owl's tree over there.

26:58.063 --> 26:59.614
Hello?

27:01.175 --> 27:02.325
Hello?

27:03.064 --> 27:04.381
Anybody home?

27:05.079 --> 27:06.963
Well, the place looks deserted.

27:06.964 --> 27:08.261
I guess we'd better get outta here.

27:17.065 --> 27:20.257
<i>Step inside my house...</i>

27:36.923 --> 27:40.096
<i>Come inside, or go away.</i>

27:49.065 --> 27:52.068
Timothy... remember Timothy.

29:05.077 --> 29:06.582
Why have you come?

29:09.160 --> 29:14.109
Please forgive me for disturbing you...

29:14.608 --> 29:18.264
but my son's life is in great danger.

29:23.921 --> 29:27.110
The plow has come early this year and...

29:27.145 --> 29:29.460
Move your family.

29:35.913 --> 29:38.017
Yes... I would move,

29:38.361 --> 29:40.529
but Timothy has pneumonia.

29:40.564 --> 29:43.069
He can't even get out of bed.

29:43.981 --> 29:49.936
You must move it to a place
where it will be safe from the plow.

29:49.982 --> 29:53.287
Please... there must be another way.

29:53.782 --> 29:55.939
There is no other way.

29:59.381 --> 30:02.810
I must bid you good evening, Mrs...?

30:03.055 --> 30:04.513
Mrs. Brisby.

30:04.963 --> 30:09.189
Brisby? Mrs. Jonathan Brisby?

30:10.112 --> 30:13.037
Why yes! He was my husband!

30:13.565 --> 30:15.624
But... how do you know about him?

30:15.659 --> 30:18.176
That is not important.

30:18.211 --> 30:20.878
I will say this...

30:21.513 --> 30:26.010
his name is not unknown in these woods.

30:26.045 --> 30:27.359
Please sir...

30:27.394 --> 30:29.942
I'll do anything to save Timmy.

30:30.585 --> 30:31.774
Anything.

30:32.985 --> 30:35.880
There is a way.

30:36.881 --> 30:39.172
Go to the rats.

30:39.207 --> 30:41.157
But I don't know any rats!

30:41.703 --> 30:43.604
In the rosebush.

30:43.639 --> 30:44.789
Oh yes...

30:45.297 --> 30:46.831
near the farmhouse.

30:46.970 --> 30:48.337
Go there.

30:49.356 --> 30:51.751
Ask for Nicodemus.

30:52.086 --> 30:53.614
Nicodemus?

30:53.649 --> 30:55.325
But how can they help?

30:55.360 --> 31:00.459
They must move your house
to the lee of the stone.

31:00.494 --> 31:03.175
No rat could move my house! It's...

31:03.210 --> 31:05.374
They have ways!

31:06.585 --> 31:08.158
I don't understand...

31:08.193 --> 31:10.017
but I will do as you say.

31:10.520 --> 31:14.037
It is night. I must go.

31:26.019 --> 31:31.485
Remember... the lee of the stone.

31:43.438 --> 31:44.968
What... what did he say?

31:45.793 --> 31:48.073
He said to go to the rats.

31:48.991 --> 31:51.661
Rats. What rats?

31:53.012 --> 31:56.471
The lee of the stone...

32:24.799 --> 32:26.426
Mrs. Briz! Briz!

32:28.631 --> 32:30.145
Oh, excuse me, pardon me.

32:30.180 --> 32:33.592
Jeremy? What on earth?

32:33.976 --> 32:36.365
I'm in disguise!

32:36.366 --> 32:39.861
Jeremy, please, not now!

32:40.608 --> 32:42.566
I'm trying to find the entrance,

32:42.601 --> 32:44.018
and these thorns are very dense.

32:44.020 --> 32:45.170
Here, let me help you...

32:46.500 --> 32:48.033
Will you be quiet?

32:48.380 --> 32:49.530
They'll hear you!

32:50.537 --> 32:52.621
I've got to find this Nicodemus

32:52.656 --> 32:55.421
before the farmer gets
that tractor fixed!

32:55.422 --> 32:56.597
I'll keep a lookout!

32:59.823 --> 33:03.694
Will you...! You're going
to get us both killed!

33:03.695 --> 33:05.138
I don't see anybody coming.

33:06.407 --> 33:08.933
If you really wanted to help me,

33:09.022 --> 33:10.391
you'd go away.

33:10.392 --> 33:12.130
Why that's very brave of you, Mrs. Briz

33:12.165 --> 33:17.062
but I can't... I can't
leave you here alone.

33:17.097 --> 33:18.493
Why, if anything were to happen,

33:18.600 --> 33:20.493
think... think of the children!

33:21.124 --> 33:21.957
That's it!

33:21.992 --> 33:23.244
Huh? That's what?

33:23.279 --> 33:24.429
Jeremy

33:25.092 --> 33:28.194
someone strong should be
protecting my children.

33:28.229 --> 33:30.631
In case that tractor starts up again.

33:30.632 --> 33:32.602
Oh, in case the tra...

33:32.603 --> 33:34.841
Hey! How 'bout me?

33:34.842 --> 33:36.736
Oh, would you?

33:36.771 --> 33:39.617
Yeah, sure! That'd be terrific practice!

33:39.652 --> 33:41.933
Girls can't resist a guy
who's good with kids,

33:41.968 --> 33:43.243
you know, domestic type.

33:43.278 --> 33:44.786
Play games, help out, domestic!

33:44.787 --> 33:46.559
Yes. Yes, domestic.

33:46.560 --> 33:50.070
Now whatever you do
don't tell them where I am.

33:50.071 --> 33:51.600
My lips are sealed, Mrs. Briz.

33:51.601 --> 33:52.751
Bye.

33:53.115 --> 33:54.602
Good luck with the rats!

34:02.183 --> 34:03.286
Where do you live?

34:03.291 --> 34:05.880
By that big stone in the garden.

34:05.915 --> 34:07.953
Just stay out of trouble?

34:07.961 --> 34:09.132
Not to worry, Mrs. Briz.

34:09.364 --> 34:11.125
I love kids and kids love me.

34:11.177 --> 34:14.525
Kids love me and I love kids.

34:28.049 --> 34:30.929
Dragon! You lazy kitty!

34:30.965 --> 34:33.393
Go catch some of those
rats out in the barn!

34:33.487 --> 34:36.214
I've never seen a cat sleep so much.

36:23.370 --> 36:24.885
Er... hello.

36:25.761 --> 36:27.792
I'm... I'm Mrs. Brisby.

36:27.793 --> 36:31.991
Umm... I was told to see Nicodemus.

36:32.912 --> 36:34.228
Are you Nicodemus?

36:35.868 --> 36:38.432
Please, I need help!

37:19.116 --> 37:20.460
Who goes there?

37:20.495 --> 37:21.437
Me!

37:21.438 --> 37:23.233
Mrs... Brisby?

37:24.530 --> 37:26.825
What are you doing here?

37:26.841 --> 37:30.387
Oh! Oh thank goodness it's you!

37:30.422 --> 37:32.528
How in thunder did you get in here?

37:32.563 --> 37:35.184
The plow has come early to the field...

37:35.219 --> 37:37.754
you had better march straight
back out the way you came!

37:37.789 --> 37:41.939
I can't bring Timothy out.
The chill in the air will kill him!

37:41.974 --> 37:44.018
That's another matter. That doesn't
explain what you're doing here.

37:44.019 --> 37:45.613
And that big rat chased me away.

37:45.648 --> 37:48.141
But I must see Nicodemus!

37:48.176 --> 37:51.015
The Owl told me to see Nicodemus!

37:51.016 --> 37:52.225
Well, yes, perhaps you should...

37:54.042 --> 37:55.995
The owl said?

37:57.600 --> 37:58.626
Here now, what owl?

37:58.661 --> 38:00.213
What are you talking about?

38:00.248 --> 38:02.798
I went to see the Great Owl.

38:02.833 --> 38:08.020
The Owl? You say you saw... the Owl?

38:08.021 --> 38:11.825
Yes, and he said I should
ask for Nicodemus.

38:11.860 --> 38:13.630
Er, yes, I know Nicodemus.

38:13.665 --> 38:14.907
He lives with the rats.

38:14.942 --> 38:16.521
More specifically,
he is the leader of the rats.

38:16.522 --> 38:17.441
You know him?

38:17.476 --> 38:20.053
No one has ever seen the Owl...

38:21.048 --> 38:22.661
and lived to tell about it!

38:22.696 --> 38:25.831
Please... could you take
me to see Nicodemus?

38:25.866 --> 38:27.016
Well...

38:29.349 --> 38:31.905
ye-e-ess, yes.

38:31.940 --> 38:35.305
But for your sake, I hope
you're telling the truth!

38:36.541 --> 38:37.322
Come on.

38:37.357 --> 38:40.999
What about the large
rat at the entrance?

38:41.034 --> 38:43.723
I can't go back there. I can't.

38:43.724 --> 38:47.289
Oh, that's just Brutus. Follow me.

38:49.280 --> 38:51.609
Well? Come on!

38:57.824 --> 39:01.002
<i>Jonathan, your wife has come at last.</i>

39:01.924 --> 39:06.235
<i>Perhaps now I can repay you
for your kindness to me.</i>

39:08.028 --> 39:13.090
<i>Yet Mrs. Brisby, who served the rats
of NIMH far more than we her.</i>

39:14.598 --> 39:18.724
<i>Jenner I fear may do her harm...</i>

39:19.860 --> 39:23.382
<i>He is consumed by a lust for power.</i>

39:25.062 --> 39:29.218
<i>Thus far, the amulet has
remained safely hidden.</i>

39:30.091 --> 39:31.845
<i>But if he finds it...</i>

39:33.464 --> 39:35.052
<i>heaven help us.</i>

39:43.754 --> 39:46.048
Forgive me, I just
noticed you're limping.

39:46.247 --> 39:47.772
That's none of your affair.

39:47.807 --> 39:50.322
Now, to what you are
about to see and hear

39:50.357 --> 39:54.272
you must swear absolute secrecy.

39:54.273 --> 39:56.491
- Yes, I unders...
- Swear it!

39:56.492 --> 39:57.642
I promise.

39:58.760 --> 40:00.489
If any of this ever got out

40:00.524 --> 40:03.599
we'd have humankind bulldozing
their way down here

40:03.634 --> 40:05.588
to blow the place apart.

40:05.589 --> 40:07.086
Is it always so dark?

40:07.087 --> 40:08.958
We're down three feet.

40:15.112 --> 40:18.689
It's the most beautiful
sight I've ever seen!

40:33.276 --> 40:36.000
Reveal thy name!

40:36.261 --> 40:38.545
Justin, you featherhead!

40:38.853 --> 40:39.984
Get your hands off me!

40:39.985 --> 40:43.299
Ok, ok, just a joke!
I didn't mean any harm.

40:43.794 --> 40:45.300
The meeting's already in progress.

40:45.301 --> 40:46.688
What's this all about?

40:46.768 --> 40:48.230
Who, may I ask?

40:48.265 --> 40:50.226
Yes, yes, she can be trusted.

40:50.261 --> 40:51.535
This is no stranger.

40:51.570 --> 40:53.992
My dear, may I present Justin,

40:54.027 --> 40:56.183
the Captain of the Guard.

40:56.218 --> 40:57.663
Justin, Mrs. Brisby.

40:57.698 --> 41:01.115
Not... Mrs. Jonathan Brisby!

41:01.150 --> 41:01.596
Yes, the same.

41:01.631 --> 41:05.320
It is an honor and a privilege, milady.

41:05.355 --> 41:08.003
If we could dispense
with the formalities...?

41:08.038 --> 41:09.446
How beautiful...

41:09.481 --> 41:10.297
Ma'am?

41:10.332 --> 41:13.522
Oh! Er... the lights!
They're quite lovely.

41:13.557 --> 41:14.831
Yes, they are.

41:14.866 --> 41:17.434
We've had electricity
for four years now.

41:17.435 --> 41:18.130
Five.

41:18.207 --> 41:20.561
Jonathan often spoke of electricity.

41:20.648 --> 41:23.642
But you see, our shame
is that we're stealing it

41:24.014 --> 41:25.494
from Farmer Fitzgibbons.

41:25.798 --> 41:26.507
Stealing?

41:26.508 --> 41:27.987
All of that is going to change.

41:28.062 --> 41:29.635
He means we're working on a Plan.

41:29.636 --> 41:31.627
I mean, that we have a Plan.

41:31.628 --> 41:33.721
And this stealing will stop.

41:35.036 --> 41:36.186
Now...

41:36.335 --> 41:38.274
Oh yes. Why did you send for me?

41:41.614 --> 41:44.342
It's Jenner. He's at it again.

41:44.377 --> 41:46.228
Hmmm. There blows an ill wind.

41:47.120 --> 41:48.602
He's before the Council now.

41:48.637 --> 41:51.278
This time he's attacking
Nicodemus openly.

41:51.313 --> 41:52.790
And the Plan, no doubt.

41:52.825 --> 41:55.153
Nothing will come of it. It'll pass.

41:56.037 --> 41:59.310
Beware, boy, he's dangerous.

41:59.752 --> 42:02.261
Jenner will be the undoing
of the Rats of NIMH.

42:10.038 --> 42:12.971
I'm sorry to come here
at such a bad time.

42:12.972 --> 42:13.827
I suppose...

42:13.828 --> 42:16.940
No, sweet lady, you are welcome here.

42:18.238 --> 42:21.024
We tend to take ourselves
a bit too seriously.

42:27.810 --> 42:30.106
The Plan is nothing but folly!

42:30.107 --> 42:32.446
A doddering old fool's fantasy!

42:32.447 --> 42:36.580
Nicodemus would have
us destroy this colony

42:36.615 --> 42:40.852
only to lead us to starvation
in some wilderness!

42:40.929 --> 42:42.827
Ahem. Good ol' Jenner.

42:42.861 --> 42:45.013
Wait. Listen.

42:45.848 --> 42:48.423
Moving to Thorn Valley is a good plan!

42:48.458 --> 42:51.277
Fie! We have everything
we need right here!

42:51.412 --> 42:53.654
You mean we steal everything we need.

42:53.689 --> 42:56.217
Well come on, you suspicious old goat!

42:56.218 --> 42:59.261
If we stay here, humans are
bound to discover us.

42:59.262 --> 43:01.437
They'd destroy us on the spot!

43:01.438 --> 43:02.042
I agree!

43:02.043 --> 43:03.660
He's right. We'll be killed.

43:03.661 --> 43:06.043
Not if we got them first!

43:06.044 --> 43:07.050
He means war!

43:07.051 --> 43:08.971
We'd be outnumbered.

43:09.006 --> 43:10.231
There are too many of them!

43:10.232 --> 43:11.237
Hear me!

43:11.353 --> 43:15.999
The Thorn Valley Plan is the aspiration
of idiots and dreamers!

43:16.034 --> 43:17.184
We...

43:18.470 --> 43:20.780
We were just talking about you.

43:20.815 --> 43:22.386
That's refreshing, Jenner.

43:22.387 --> 43:24.257
Usually you're screaming about us.

43:24.368 --> 43:25.849
Who is that?

43:25.850 --> 43:27.332
You know the rules

43:27.367 --> 43:29.185
there are no visitors allowed here.

43:29.862 --> 43:33.433
May I present Mrs. Jonathan Brisby.

43:34.908 --> 43:36.580
Jonathan Brisby is dead!

43:36.615 --> 43:38.007
She's not one of us.

43:38.042 --> 43:39.598
What's the meaning of this?

43:39.633 --> 43:40.837
Send her away.

43:40.872 --> 43:42.447
Let's get back to business!

43:42.448 --> 43:43.160
Wait, wait!

43:43.195 --> 43:46.801
She has been to see the Great Owl!

43:48.080 --> 43:52.156
He has told her that we could move
the Brisby home to safety.

43:53.070 --> 43:55.611
Her home was Jonathan's home.

43:55.646 --> 43:57.347
We have urgent problems of our own.

43:57.382 --> 43:59.919
Let the lower creatures
fend for themselves!

44:02.223 --> 44:03.547
Order, order!

44:03.582 --> 44:07.523
Wait, my friend. I smell an opportunity.

44:07.558 --> 44:08.317
What?

44:08.318 --> 44:10.921
Manoeuvers of this nature are dangerous.

44:10.922 --> 44:14.775
- Accidents could happen...
- Accidents?

44:14.776 --> 44:16.740
Jenner?
- I'll explain later.

44:16.775 --> 44:19.966
Mrs. Brisby! A
thousand pardons, my dear!

44:20.001 --> 44:22.878
Forgive the ill temper of my colleague.

44:22.913 --> 44:27.793
It would be an honor to assist
Jonathan's widow in any way.

44:27.828 --> 44:31.356
We are but your humble servants.

44:31.634 --> 44:32.520
Th... thank-you.

44:32.555 --> 44:34.364
I second the motion.

44:34.399 --> 44:35.008
Hear hear!

44:35.043 --> 44:36.768
Motion has been moved and seconded.

44:36.803 --> 44:39.078
Those in favor make a show of hands.

44:39.207 --> 44:40.982
He's up to something...

44:41.017 --> 44:43.558
Take Mrs. Brisby to the library.

44:43.593 --> 44:45.789
We'll approach Nicodemus
when the meeting's over.

44:45.874 --> 44:47.024
Motion carried.

44:54.127 --> 44:55.724
Ok now, wait a minute

44:55.725 --> 44:56.947
this isn't what you think.

44:57.714 --> 44:59.860
You don't understand
what I'm doing here!

44:59.861 --> 45:03.680
Think you can come snooping
about looting and pilfering,

45:03.715 --> 45:05.716
just when everyone's away?

45:05.717 --> 45:07.842
Well uh... Let me explain about...

45:07.877 --> 45:10.201
Oh! What a lovely hat you're wearing!

45:10.236 --> 45:12.245
Don't you sweettalk me!

45:12.280 --> 45:15.687
I know you're in league
with those awful rats!

45:15.722 --> 45:18.707
Rats? Ummm... what rats?

45:18.708 --> 45:20.354
Hoodlums, the lot of you!

45:20.389 --> 45:22.163
Ummmm... why did you say rats?

45:22.198 --> 45:25.261
You think the world owes
you a living, right?

45:25.296 --> 45:25.922
Right.

45:25.957 --> 45:26.859
Wrong!

45:26.894 --> 45:28.044
Wrong! Ohhhh..

45:28.602 --> 45:32.205
Look, nice lady, you're
making a mistake!

45:32.240 --> 45:36.177
The sooner you delinquents learn that
you must earn your own way...

45:36.247 --> 45:37.842
Wait! Wait, can't we uh...

45:39.163 --> 45:40.391
Can't we talk this over?

45:40.444 --> 45:43.651
The sooner, the better.

45:43.652 --> 45:45.903
You can't leave me like this!
There's a ca... ca...

45:45.938 --> 45:47.583
There's a ca... He's a very big...

45:47.618 --> 45:49.661
and he might... and he might... mlfffp!

45:49.696 --> 45:53.032
Good! Good riddance!

45:53.067 --> 45:55.405
Teresa! Martin!

45:55.440 --> 45:58.862
That's the least you deserve.

45:58.897 --> 45:59.704
Auntie?

45:59.739 --> 46:01.242
There you are!

46:02.455 --> 46:04.552
Keep an eye on this hooligan.

46:04.587 --> 46:08.486
Make sure he doesn't get away
until I can fetch help.

46:09.162 --> 46:12.154
And as for you, you black buzzard.

46:12.189 --> 46:14.838
I wouldn't try anything!

46:14.873 --> 46:18.535
I shall return!

46:22.055 --> 46:24.307
Well, I guess we'd better untie him.

46:24.308 --> 46:25.317
But Martin...

46:25.318 --> 46:29.810
Hey, Mom helped a crow in the field
the day before yesterday...

46:30.617 --> 46:32.376
He's trying to talk!

46:32.411 --> 46:34.041
He looks like a loony.

46:35.036 --> 46:37.841
He even took her to see
the... the Great Owl!

46:37.876 --> 46:38.403
So?

46:38.404 --> 46:40.247
This could be the same crow!

46:42.218 --> 46:45.934
That's me all... Whew! I am the crow.

46:45.969 --> 46:48.660
Untie me quick, I can't stand it!

46:48.695 --> 46:50.658
What are you doing here?

46:50.693 --> 46:52.119
Oh, it's a good question, but don't ask.

46:52.154 --> 46:54.769
The legs... the legs... THE LEGS!

46:55.441 --> 46:58.301
Aw, the poor turkey fell down.

46:58.546 --> 47:01.576
I'm not a turkey! Your mother...

47:01.611 --> 47:03.300
Where's our mother!

47:03.335 --> 47:05.711
You big buzzard, where's our mother?

47:05.712 --> 47:07.011
- What have you done with her?
- You'd better tell me

47:07.039 --> 47:09.061
or I'll tie you back up again!

47:09.062 --> 47:11.191
The... the rosebush! To...
to see the rats!

47:11.226 --> 47:12.849
Did you take our mother to the rats?

47:12.884 --> 47:13.967
Well I'm going to go look for her.

47:14.002 --> 47:15.758
No, no, listen, hold it, waitaminute.

47:15.793 --> 47:17.654
The rats, they're friendly!

47:17.689 --> 47:19.298
Good! Tonight... Stay!

47:19.333 --> 47:23.969
They're coming here to move
your house where it's safe!

47:24.004 --> 47:25.053
Understand?

47:25.088 --> 47:25.965
Sta-a-ay...

47:26.000 --> 47:28.402
The Owl said they're good and smart.

47:28.437 --> 47:29.587
Get it?

47:31.063 --> 47:32.970
You're right. He's a loony.

47:33.005 --> 47:34.856
Oh no... no, don't...

47:35.089 --> 47:35.689
You must...

47:35.690 --> 47:37.522
No, don't do this!...

47:44.275 --> 47:45.909
Now don't tire him out.

47:45.910 --> 47:46.778
No.

47:47.064 --> 47:48.007
Be brief.

47:48.042 --> 47:49.079
Yes.

47:49.114 --> 47:51.017
Say what you want... and leave.

47:51.052 --> 47:52.202
I won't be a bother.

47:53.643 --> 47:56.423
Justin bothers him enough
with all his silly nonsense.

47:58.065 --> 47:58.575
Here we are.

47:58.576 --> 48:00.177
Thank you, Mr. Ages.

48:00.212 --> 48:02.771
I don't know what Nicodemus
sees in that boy...

48:02.806 --> 48:04.406
I'll come back for you.

48:09.066 --> 48:11.224
- Brief!
- Brief.

48:46.171 --> 48:48.472
Come closer, my child.

48:49.473 --> 48:51.199
Don't be frightened.

48:52.841 --> 48:53.991
Sir...

48:55.451 --> 48:59.025
the Great Owl sent me to you.

48:59.123 --> 49:01.276
Oh, did he?

49:03.377 --> 49:05.885
He is a dear comrade...

49:07.200 --> 49:08.350
Closer.

49:10.989 --> 49:14.810
Ahhh, Mrs. Jonathan Brisby.

49:15.860 --> 49:17.824
What an honor this is.

49:17.825 --> 49:18.825
How...

49:18.826 --> 49:22.949
how is it that everyone knows Jonathan?

49:22.950 --> 49:26.325
He was a great friend
to the Rats of NIMH.

49:27.430 --> 49:30.285
He himself came from NIMH.

49:30.286 --> 49:32.815
Your majesty, my family is...

49:32.816 --> 49:35.144
I know of your needs.

49:36.544 --> 49:40.932
There is a book there. Read the words.

49:40.933 --> 49:42.627
I can read, a little.

49:43.325 --> 49:44.549
Jonathan taught me.

49:45.961 --> 49:47.164
The children are better...

49:49.873 --> 49:51.074
than I am...

49:54.210 --> 49:55.360
<i>Read.</i>

49:58.206 --> 50:01.916
Jonathan... Brisby... made...

50:03.277 --> 50:04.741
possible...

50:05.338 --> 50:07.981
the rats escape...

50:08.913 --> 50:10.476
from the t...

50:11.000 --> 50:13.303
terrible cruelty of NIMH.

50:13.386 --> 50:14.536
Jonathan?

50:15.594 --> 50:17.089
He was ki..

50:20.076 --> 50:22.372
Killed today...

50:23.354 --> 50:28.245
while drugging the farmer's cat, Dragon.

50:31.077 --> 50:36.789
Oh, I... I never knew...
just what happened.

50:39.298 --> 50:43.304
Why did he never tell
me about any of you?

50:44.287 --> 50:45.004
Why?

50:45.005 --> 50:49.078
To answer that, I must
tell you about NIMH

50:49.079 --> 50:50.784
and our Plan.

50:52.913 --> 50:54.063
Go!

50:54.964 --> 50:56.114
Look there!

51:20.080 --> 51:24.921
<i>In the beginning, we were
ordinary street rats.</i>

51:25.801 --> 51:30.804
<i>Stealing our daily bread and
living off the efforts of man's work.</i>

51:34.672 --> 51:37.809
<i>We were captured, put in cages</i>

51:37.844 --> 51:40.014
<i>and sent to a place called NIMH.</i>

51:41.155 --> 51:45.421
<i>There were many animals
there... in cages.</i>

51:46.204 --> 51:50.184
<i>They were put
through the most unspeakable tortures</i>

51:50.868 --> 51:54.999
<i>to satisfy some scientific curiosity.</i>

51:56.384 --> 52:01.137
<i>Often at night I would hear
them crying out in anguish.</i>

52:03.692 --> 52:07.872
<i>Twenty rats and eleven mice
were given injections.</i>

52:12.984 --> 52:15.707
<i>Our world began changing...</i>

52:43.087 --> 52:44.237
<i>Then</i>

52:45.287 --> 52:46.437
<i>one night.</i>

52:47.149 --> 52:50.914
<i>I looked upon the words
under the cage door...</i>

52:52.375 --> 52:54.433
<i>and understood them.</i>

53:01.088 --> 53:04.944
<i>We had become intelligent.</i>

53:07.589 --> 53:09.299
<i>We could read.</i>

53:10.569 --> 53:13.582
<i>The miracle was kept secret
from the scientists.</i>

53:14.342 --> 53:16.574
<i>And in the quiet of the night</i>

53:16.989 --> 53:19.996
<i>we escaped
through the ventilation system.</i>

53:23.090 --> 53:24.966
<i>The mice were blown away</i>

53:31.654 --> 53:35.177
<i>sucked down dark air-shafts
to their deaths.</i>

53:36.091 --> 53:39.084
<i>All except two...</i>

53:39.891 --> 53:43.290
<i>Jonathan and Mr. Ages.</i>

53:45.097 --> 53:48.133
<i>We were trapped by a locked
door on the roof.</i>

53:50.352 --> 53:54.209
<i>It was Jonathan who made
possible the unlocking of the door.</i>

54:01.691 --> 54:04.629
I have a gift. Come.

54:05.594 --> 54:07.412
Jonathan meant it for you.

54:12.272 --> 54:14.156
It's so beautiful!

54:14.157 --> 54:15.632
It sleeps.

54:15.667 --> 54:17.224
Sleeps?

54:17.259 --> 54:18.442
Yes.

54:19.548 --> 54:22.076
When worn by one with a courageous heart

54:22.228 --> 54:25.318
the Stone glows red.

54:26.095 --> 54:29.381
It becomes a blinding radiance.

54:30.011 --> 54:32.960
Courage of the heart is very rare.

54:33.921 --> 54:37.998
The Stone has a power when it's there.

54:39.104 --> 54:41.500
Look! An inscription.

54:43.472 --> 54:47.222
You can... unlock any door...

54:47.257 --> 54:50.235
if you only have the key.

54:52.539 --> 54:53.760
Oh, thank you.

54:54.492 --> 54:57.118
I will treasure it always.

54:58.109 --> 55:00.820
Jonathan couldn't tell you about NIMH

55:00.855 --> 55:05.131
because the injections
slowed the aging process.

55:05.889 --> 55:11.878
You see, you would have grown old
while he remained young.

55:12.332 --> 55:13.482
Nicodemus.

55:14.752 --> 55:16.200
The boats are ready and waiting.

55:17.377 --> 55:18.404
We can leave any time.

55:18.467 --> 55:19.617
Good.

55:20.817 --> 55:25.095
My child, shall we journey to your home?

55:25.130 --> 55:26.091
Sir?

55:26.126 --> 55:32.413
Tonight we must move your house
to the protected side of the stone.

55:33.100 --> 55:34.620
The lee of the stone!

55:34.655 --> 55:35.805
Yes.

55:42.271 --> 55:44.311
I don't get it, Jenner.

55:46.226 --> 55:47.902
With Nicodemus out of the way

55:47.937 --> 55:51.271
what's to stop us from taking over?

55:51.306 --> 55:53.612
Jenner, you can't kill Nicodemus!

55:53.647 --> 55:55.678
No taste for blood, eh?

55:55.713 --> 55:58.789
They've taken the animal out of you.

55:58.824 --> 56:00.631
What if we're discovered?

56:00.666 --> 56:01.924
Ach, listen.

56:01.959 --> 56:05.523
The Brisby house
is a large cement block.

56:05.558 --> 56:08.841
In the moving, what if it should fall?

56:08.876 --> 56:11.551
- An accident?
- Of course!

56:11.586 --> 56:17.451
Cut the lines, and the weight of it
will crush his bones!

56:17.796 --> 56:18.853
It's risky..

56:18.888 --> 56:22.333
Once rid of Nicodemus,
the Plan will die.

56:22.368 --> 56:25.926
We can stay here as long as we like!

56:25.961 --> 56:27.900
What... what about Justin?

56:27.935 --> 56:30.107
Leave him to me...

56:38.800 --> 56:43.068
Sometimes, when we have a large project
that takes us into the open.

56:43.453 --> 56:46.434
Mr. Ages makes up a sleeping
powder to give to Dragon.

56:46.536 --> 56:48.109
How do you get him to take it?

56:48.144 --> 56:52.196
Someone must go
into the farmhouse kitchen

56:53.191 --> 56:54.579
and put it in his dish.

56:55.696 --> 56:57.563
The only way into the kitchen

56:58.260 --> 57:00.471
is through a tiny hole in the floor.

57:01.106 --> 57:02.881
Ages tried it yesterday.

57:03.671 --> 57:04.553
That's how he broke...

57:04.588 --> 57:05.957
Broke his leg.

57:06.871 --> 57:08.021
Right.

57:13.413 --> 57:14.563
That was close.

57:14.890 --> 57:18.557
- What's up there?
- The mill. It's falling apart.

57:19.258 --> 57:20.720
Hope it stays up there

57:21.304 --> 57:23.023
at least until we've done with the Plan.

57:23.058 --> 57:26.435
Plan... what is the Plan?

57:28.344 --> 57:31.022
To live without stealing, of course.

57:31.057 --> 57:33.690
It's wrong to take
electricity from the farmer.

57:34.358 --> 57:39.097
My child, we can no longer live as rats.

57:40.407 --> 57:42.173
We know too much.

57:42.913 --> 57:44.110
We're almost there.

57:44.353 --> 57:47.231
Um... your Majesty

57:47.269 --> 57:49.877
I should go prepare
the children, for tonight.

57:51.619 --> 57:54.278
We shall wait here until dark...

57:55.048 --> 57:57.746
Um... About Dragon, maybe...

58:00.443 --> 58:02.392
Oh nothing. Goodbye!

58:15.308 --> 58:18.929
I volunteer! For Dragon.

58:19.300 --> 58:20.896
Oh no, Mrs. Brisby!

58:21.133 --> 58:23.105
Nicodemus, this is no job for her!

58:23.113 --> 58:24.326
Please.

58:24.913 --> 58:26.174
As you wish.

58:26.922 --> 58:28.257
All right.

58:29.506 --> 58:32.755
I'll meet you at the west
side of the farmhouse at dusk.

58:33.613 --> 58:36.016
Thank you.
Oh I must be crazy.

58:38.227 --> 58:39.209
Goodbye!

58:39.210 --> 58:40.467
I must be crazy...

58:58.673 --> 59:00.388
Excuse me... pardon me.

59:00.389 --> 59:01.442
Jeremy?

59:01.477 --> 59:03.549
Shhh! I'm being followed.

59:04.203 --> 59:05.097
Followed?

59:05.122 --> 59:07.752
Shhh-hhh! There's a crazy
lady with a hat!

59:07.753 --> 59:08.727
She's got big teeth!

59:08.754 --> 59:10.701
She tied me up! And then I... oh!

59:12.116 --> 59:15.137
Ooooo! A sparkly!

59:15.172 --> 59:15.835
What?

59:15.870 --> 59:18.933
You're wearing a sparkly!

59:18.968 --> 59:21.117
Can I hold? Oh, please, can I?

59:21.118 --> 59:22.268
Jeremy, listen...

59:23.117 --> 59:24.987
I need lots and lots of string.

59:25.022 --> 59:26.133
Stuh... ring...

59:26.134 --> 59:27.434
To move the block!

59:27.469 --> 59:29.667
Move... the block...

59:29.702 --> 59:32.357
Hey! I got string! I've been saving 'em!

59:32.482 --> 59:32.907
You do?

59:32.908 --> 59:34.198
Oh sure, red ones, blue ones

59:34.199 --> 59:35.704
- green, yellow.
- Pay attention!

59:35.749 --> 59:37.344
Go get all the string you can.

59:37.715 --> 59:38.865
Ok.

59:40.664 --> 59:41.819
But that'll take all day!

59:41.820 --> 59:43.916
Good! Get going!

59:48.266 --> 59:51.543
I just thought I'd mention in passing...

59:51.578 --> 59:55.804
I've always wanted
a sparkly of my very own.

59:55.805 --> 59:57.564
- Will you get going?
- Sure!

59:57.599 --> 59:58.740
Uh... Excuse me. Pardon me.

59:58.741 --> 59:59.891
Bye!

01:00:07.498 --> 01:00:09.121
It won't be long now.

01:00:09.122 --> 01:00:10.460
She's washing the dishes.

01:00:11.121 --> 01:00:12.309
Here's the powder.

01:00:12.774 --> 01:00:14.910
- Nervous?
- Very.

01:00:14.911 --> 01:00:16.784
Don't be.
You'll be ok.

01:00:16.785 --> 01:00:18.872
I hope I haven't upset your plans.

01:00:18.873 --> 01:00:20.167
Nonsense!

01:00:20.202 --> 01:00:21.482
What makes you say that?

01:00:21.483 --> 01:00:23.860
I thought I might have
caused an argument.

01:00:23.895 --> 01:00:24.837
Oh you mean Jenner.

01:00:24.872 --> 01:00:26.022
No problem.

01:00:26.744 --> 01:00:27.894
Justin?

01:00:28.601 --> 01:00:31.435
I sincerly hope you make
it to Thorn Valley.

01:00:31.436 --> 01:00:32.508
We will.

01:00:32.509 --> 01:00:34.257
Shh! Listen.

01:00:36.644 --> 01:00:38.879
Mrs. Fitzgibbons
is filling Dragon's bowl.

01:00:40.123 --> 01:00:41.123
Get ready.

01:00:41.124 --> 01:00:42.274
Oh my...

01:00:43.688 --> 01:00:44.872
Better leave that cape.

01:00:44.907 --> 01:00:46.595
Could get caught on something.

01:00:49.597 --> 01:00:50.747
Here's the powder.

01:00:53.916 --> 01:00:55.123
I don't think I can do this!

01:00:55.125 --> 01:00:56.275
Yes you can!

01:00:57.267 --> 01:00:58.770
Now take a deep breath.

01:01:00.133 --> 01:01:01.284
Concentrate on the bowl.

01:01:01.925 --> 01:01:03.275
Don't look at the door!

01:01:03.527 --> 01:01:04.677
Steady...

01:01:07.125 --> 01:01:08.690
Ok Dragon, I'm coming.

01:01:09.237 --> 01:01:10.387
Steady...

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:11.896
There we go.

01:01:12.649 --> 01:01:14.984
Now! Now!

01:01:20.298 --> 01:01:21.957
Coming, coming!

01:01:23.126 --> 01:01:24.276
Get back!

01:01:27.296 --> 01:01:29.127
Mom! Don't let the cat in yet

01:01:29.128 --> 01:01:30.263
I've caught a mouse!

01:01:30.298 --> 01:01:31.300
A mouse?

01:01:31.301 --> 01:01:32.988
Can I keep it? Can I?

01:01:33.023 --> 01:01:36.027
No, Billy. Put it outside.

01:01:36.028 --> 01:01:37.126
Damn!

01:01:37.127 --> 01:01:38.521
Aw Mom, please?

01:01:38.556 --> 01:01:40.683
I can keep it in Porgy's old cage.

01:01:40.718 --> 01:01:42.794
Oh... all right.

01:01:42.829 --> 01:01:44.128
Come on, Dragon.

01:01:44.129 --> 01:01:45.886
I'll have to come back for you later.

01:01:49.179 --> 01:01:51.529
Rats, rats?

01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:53.316
They'll be here any minute...

01:01:53.317 --> 01:01:55.416
to move our house
over there by the stone!

01:01:55.417 --> 01:01:56.795
Wrong!

01:01:56.796 --> 01:01:58.405
Actually move it!

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.874
Not while I'm keeping watch!

01:02:00.909 --> 01:02:03.684
Auntie Shrew? I'm not afraid.

01:02:03.719 --> 01:02:05.035
Afraid, child?

01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:08.615
I have no fear of those
great hulking beasts.

01:02:08.650 --> 01:02:13.724
And should one of those hairy
barbarians come through that door...

01:02:15.472 --> 01:02:17.724
Oh! The rats!

01:02:29.332 --> 01:02:32.033
I'm coming, I'm coming,
hold your horses.

01:02:32.947 --> 01:02:34.097
Hello?

01:02:34.461 --> 01:02:35.611
Who?

01:02:36.755 --> 01:02:37.814
NIMH.

01:02:37.849 --> 01:02:39.655
Oh! Oh yeah, NIMH!

01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:42.608
Yes, yes, I know, you
called about the rats...

01:02:43.417 --> 01:02:45.933
Well, I don't know nothing
about any special behavior

01:02:45.934 --> 01:02:48.984
but the traps sure don't work...

01:02:49.624 --> 01:02:50.774
In the morning?

01:02:51.657 --> 01:02:52.838
Suits me fine...

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:56.538
Oh no, no, you can bulldoze
that rosebush right outta there

01:02:56.539 --> 01:02:58.354
I want those rats exterminated!

01:02:58.355 --> 01:03:01.004
Uh, well, there's no... charge...?

01:03:01.939 --> 01:03:03.026
Good. Ok,

01:03:03.027 --> 01:03:05.134
well, I'll see you tomorrow then...

01:03:05.135 --> 01:03:07.000
Uh-huh... bye-bye.

01:03:07.235 --> 01:03:10.110
NIMH... They're coming here?

01:03:10.421 --> 01:03:12.008
I must warn Justin!

01:03:40.326 --> 01:03:41.602
Teresa!

01:03:43.142 --> 01:03:44.299
Martin!

01:03:45.137 --> 01:03:46.807
Auntie's afraid!

01:03:51.279 --> 01:03:52.667
Pull on the end-haul.

01:03:53.668 --> 01:03:55.798
Careful. Careful!

01:03:56.838 --> 01:03:57.841
Easy does it...

01:03:57.842 --> 01:04:00.393
Nicodemus is cooperating beautifully...

01:04:00.394 --> 01:04:01.149
Jenner...

01:04:01.395 --> 01:04:03.931
he's standing in just the right spot!

01:04:05.327 --> 01:04:07.049
Jenner, I... I can't do it!

01:04:07.050 --> 01:04:09.456
When that block reaches
midway, you cut the line.

01:04:09.457 --> 01:04:10.607
I...

01:04:10.729 --> 01:04:14.299
Don't get any ideas, my friend.

01:04:14.334 --> 01:04:17.147
You're in this up to your neck!

01:04:17.490 --> 01:04:18.692
Come on mates!

01:04:19.233 --> 01:04:20.943
Put your backs into it!

01:04:59.743 --> 01:05:00.943
Ready with the knife...

01:05:04.082 --> 01:05:05.232
Ready...

01:05:07.872 --> 01:05:09.022
Cut now!

01:05:09.724 --> 01:05:11.405
- I... I...
- Now! Cut it!

01:05:11.406 --> 01:05:12.556
Don't!

01:05:31.144 --> 01:05:32.146
Ok, help.

01:05:32.147 --> 01:05:33.147
We've got to hurry!

01:05:33.148 --> 01:05:34.298
That's it.

01:05:36.282 --> 01:05:37.272
Come on, come on!

01:05:37.273 --> 01:05:38.423
We're coming!

01:05:40.005 --> 01:05:43.266
Ok, I see him!

01:05:47.969 --> 01:05:49.323
Nicodemus...

01:05:50.726 --> 01:05:51.947
oh no!

01:05:53.147 --> 01:05:54.297
No!

01:06:50.447 --> 01:06:51.597
Friends...

01:06:51.755 --> 01:06:54.166
we cannot move the Brisby home.

01:06:54.431 --> 01:06:56.922
But we... we just can't leave it here

01:06:57.802 --> 01:06:58.952
in the mud.

01:06:59.053 --> 01:07:01.053
The equipment is a shambles.

01:07:01.254 --> 01:07:02.304
Justin!

01:07:02.488 --> 01:07:07.125
One day we shall journey to
Thorn Valley just as Nicodemus wanted...

01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:08.835
but not now.

01:07:08.836 --> 01:07:09.986
Justin!

01:07:10.238 --> 01:07:11.960
Mrs... Brisby?

01:07:12.195 --> 01:07:15.352
Come. Let us return to the rosebush.

01:07:15.930 --> 01:07:17.163
Where we belong.

01:07:19.154 --> 01:07:20.312
Oh, Mr. Ages!

01:07:21.364 --> 01:07:22.558
What happened?

01:07:22.881 --> 01:07:23.901
The children!

01:07:23.936 --> 01:07:25.709
They... they're fine.

01:07:27.818 --> 01:07:31.480
Nicodemus is... dead.

01:07:31.481 --> 01:07:34.293
Oh... oh, no.

01:07:39.162 --> 01:07:40.477
You're in great danger.

01:07:40.512 --> 01:07:41.919
NIMH is coming!

01:07:41.954 --> 01:07:43.771
Come come, let's return
to the rosebush...

01:07:43.772 --> 01:07:44.756
NIMH is coming!

01:07:44.757 --> 01:07:45.956
- NIMH?
- In the morning!

01:07:45.957 --> 01:07:47.106
- NIMH!
- Yes.

01:07:47.107 --> 01:07:49.467
You will all die unless you
leave the farm tonight.

01:07:49.468 --> 01:07:50.471
Lies!

01:07:50.472 --> 01:07:52.401
Please! You must believe me!

01:07:52.436 --> 01:07:53.456
What if it's true?

01:07:53.457 --> 01:07:54.744
- We'll all be killed!
- Don't panic!

01:07:54.745 --> 01:07:56.559
Don't listen! She's hysterical!

01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:57.710
Get out now...

01:07:58.441 --> 01:07:59.957
You get out! I've had enough!

01:07:59.958 --> 01:08:01.108
Jenner!

01:08:01.263 --> 01:08:02.631
Justin! Justin!

01:08:08.185 --> 01:08:09.458
Jenner, stop this!

01:08:12.161 --> 01:08:13.253
The Stone...

01:08:13.382 --> 01:08:14.145
Jenner...

01:08:14.146 --> 01:08:15.305
Get out of my way!

01:08:20.344 --> 01:08:22.015
I want that Stone!

01:08:24.871 --> 01:08:26.020
Jenner!

01:08:29.816 --> 01:08:31.644
Justin, Justin!

01:08:31.645 --> 01:08:32.795
My sword!

01:08:55.048 --> 01:08:56.198
It was you...

01:08:58.345 --> 01:08:59.540
You did it!

01:08:59.795 --> 01:09:00.978
You killed Nicodemus.

01:09:01.814 --> 01:09:03.216
That was no accident!

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.323
Yes. I killed him!

01:09:23.837 --> 01:09:25.627
He wanted to destroy everything!

01:09:27.776 --> 01:09:29.276
I've learned this much.

01:09:29.277 --> 01:09:33.224
Take what you can, when you can!

01:09:33.286 --> 01:09:35.608
Then you've learned nothing!

01:09:52.314 --> 01:09:53.465
Friends...

01:09:54.766 --> 01:09:56.786
tonight we journey to Thorn Valley.

01:09:59.351 --> 01:10:00.842
We will leave no tracks.

01:10:03.805 --> 01:10:06.878
No evidence that the Rats
of NIMH ever existed...

01:10:08.167 --> 01:10:09.317
Come.

01:10:45.329 --> 01:10:46.958
Hello, is anybody up there?

01:10:47.650 --> 01:10:49.404
- Martin?
- Momma!

01:10:49.639 --> 01:10:51.970
Mother, are we almost moved?

01:10:52.405 --> 01:10:53.555
Soon now...

01:11:05.756 --> 01:11:06.906
It's sinking...

01:11:07.171 --> 01:11:08.321
it's sinking...

01:11:10.292 --> 01:11:13.172
Justin, the block! It's sinking!

01:11:13.173 --> 01:11:14.323
What?

01:11:16.572 --> 01:11:17.572
Come on!

01:11:17.573 --> 01:11:18.901
Oh no, it's sinking!

01:11:18.902 --> 01:11:22.046
There must be a... a cave in below!

01:11:22.422 --> 01:11:23.722
Here, tie these lines together.

01:11:23.852 --> 01:11:25.249
I'll get a line around the stone.

01:11:25.250 --> 01:11:26.373
Now!

01:11:26.374 --> 01:11:27.403
Brutus, quick, get some rope.

01:11:27.404 --> 01:11:28.684
Tie off those blocklines.

01:11:29.019 --> 01:11:30.169
Hurry it up, come on!

01:11:30.347 --> 01:11:31.497
Move it!

01:11:32.537 --> 01:11:34.246
Mother! Mother!

01:11:34.574 --> 01:11:36.652
What's all that black stuff?

01:11:36.653 --> 01:11:39.388
Come on, Teresa, get up on the table!

01:11:39.389 --> 01:11:40.438
Cynthia...!

01:11:40.473 --> 01:11:41.772
What about Timmy?

01:11:41.807 --> 01:11:43.374
Get us out of here!

01:11:43.709 --> 01:11:44.859
Mother!

01:11:49.754 --> 01:11:51.924
Another line! Get some rope!

01:11:52.566 --> 01:11:53.716
Justin!

01:11:56.271 --> 01:11:57.421
Justin!

01:11:59.995 --> 01:12:02.045
Hang on! Don't let go!

01:12:06.758 --> 01:12:08.076
Grab onto my foot!

01:12:08.127 --> 01:12:09.431
I can't breathe!

01:12:21.353 --> 01:12:22.810
Oh no! Come on!

01:12:23.234 --> 01:12:25.184
- It's sinking farther!
- We're losing it!

01:12:56.809 --> 01:12:59.499
Courage of the heart is very rare...

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:04.719
the Stone has a power when it's there.

01:13:04.779 --> 01:13:05.929
The stone...

01:15:31.191 --> 01:15:34.192
Momma, I'm tired of bed.
I want to get up!

01:15:34.432 --> 01:15:36.278
Well, you're not getting up.

01:15:37.559 --> 01:15:39.513
Miss Briz! Oh Briz!

01:15:39.748 --> 01:15:40.825
Where are ya?

01:15:40.826 --> 01:15:41.976
Over here!

01:15:43.213 --> 01:15:44.363
Here it is!

01:15:45.267 --> 01:15:46.603
I brought the whole mess!

01:15:46.638 --> 01:15:48.201
There's plenty more where
this came from too.

01:15:48.202 --> 01:15:49.605
I got connections!

01:15:50.494 --> 01:15:52.578
Hey! Your house is moved!

01:15:52.613 --> 01:15:56.114
Oh no! What am I gonna
do with all this string?

01:15:56.449 --> 01:15:57.991
You'll think of something.

01:15:58.571 --> 01:16:01.316
Ah, what's the use?

01:16:01.871 --> 01:16:05.234
What's a guy like me going to
do with a love nest anyway?

01:16:10.654 --> 01:16:12.358
- Excuse me, pardon me.
- Excuse me, pardon me.

01:16:13.101 --> 01:16:15.657
Look Mommy! Another turkey!

01:16:19.743 --> 01:16:21.561
Stay right there.

01:16:21.970 --> 01:16:23.576
Miss Briz! Miss Briz!

01:16:23.611 --> 01:16:26.708
Lemme have the sparkly!
I gotta have the sparkly!

01:16:26.743 --> 01:16:28.406
Miss B, I gotta have it!

01:16:28.441 --> 01:16:31.073
Girls can't resist a sparkly,
oh please! Pleease!

01:16:31.074 --> 01:16:32.353
I gave it to Justin.

01:16:32.354 --> 01:16:34.153
Justin? Who the heck is Justin?

01:16:34.154 --> 01:16:35.251
The leader of the rats.

01:16:35.252 --> 01:16:37.868
The leader of the rats!? How
could you do this to me?

01:16:37.903 --> 01:16:41.338
What'll I say? Mrs. B, what'll I do?

01:16:41.339 --> 01:16:42.489
Well...

01:16:42.930 --> 01:16:46.151
just be, ummm... Be athletic!

01:16:46.152 --> 01:16:48.573
Ah! That's right! Athletic!

01:16:50.014 --> 01:16:52.161
I'll just be a little...

01:17:10.153 --> 01:17:12.964
Mother, did the rats
really go to Thorn Valley?

01:17:13.014 --> 01:17:13.826
Yes, they did.

01:17:13.827 --> 01:17:15.874
- Will we ever see them?
- Perhaps.

01:17:15.875 --> 01:17:19.703
- Today?
- No... when you're older.

01:17:19.738 --> 01:17:21.152
Brisby!

01:17:21.153 --> 01:17:22.356
Oh! Auntie Shrew!

01:17:22.357 --> 01:17:23.811
Oh Auntie!

01:17:23.812 --> 01:17:25.421
Oh no!
