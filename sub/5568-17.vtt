WEBVTT

00:04.372 --> 00:05.971
You sure they're gonna show?

00:05.973 --> 00:08.841
Hey, my hook-up always shows.

00:08.843 --> 00:10.175
Have I ever let you down?

00:10.177 --> 00:12.644
Did you bring any hard candy,
like I asked?

00:12.646 --> 00:13.779
No.

00:13.781 --> 00:15.147
There you go.

00:15.149 --> 00:17.916
¶¶

00:24.158 --> 00:25.991
(car door closes)

00:25.993 --> 00:28.260
'Sup, Hector? This him?

00:33.968 --> 00:35.968
Think you can handle
our product?

00:35.970 --> 00:39.471
I got more handles
than a yogurt shop.

00:43.677 --> 00:46.211
Ghost peppers...
Hottest in the world.

00:47.415 --> 00:49.048
(chuckles)

00:49.050 --> 00:52.051
My ticket to winning the North
Orlando Chili Cook-off.

00:52.053 --> 00:53.552
Oh, it's gonna cost you.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.154
Well, then, it's a good thing

00:55.156 --> 00:56.989
I own a semi-successful
restaurant.

00:56.991 --> 00:59.725
How much? $1.75.

01:01.228 --> 01:02.228
Each.

01:06.033 --> 01:07.766
These guys are good.

01:10.237 --> 01:11.703
¶ Fresh off the boat ¶

01:11.705 --> 01:13.272
¶ I'm gettin' mine
everywhere I go ¶

01:13.274 --> 01:15.207
¶ If you don't know, homey,
now you know ¶

01:15.209 --> 01:16.775
¶ Fresh off the boat ¶

01:16.777 --> 01:18.944
¶ Homey, you don't know
where I come from ¶

01:18.946 --> 01:20.546
¶ But I know where I'm goin' ¶

01:20.548 --> 01:23.182
¶ I'm fresh off the boat ¶

01:23.717 --> 01:25.417
¶¶

01:25.419 --> 01:28.854
Jessica: (sighs)
The orderly flow of traffic.

01:28.856 --> 01:31.523
(speaks Chinese)

01:31.525 --> 01:34.293
This is called "zippering."

01:34.295 --> 01:37.196
One car from one lane
and one car from another lane

01:37.198 --> 01:40.766
merge to form
one single lane of efficiency.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.868
It's amazing
what society can learn

01:42.870 --> 01:44.136
from a pair of pants.

01:44.138 --> 01:47.306
(speaking Chinese)

01:47.308 --> 01:48.540
Excuse me.

01:48.542 --> 01:51.910
Excuse me,
lady in the ugly vest?

01:51.912 --> 01:53.212
I'm sorry. Can I help you?

01:53.214 --> 01:55.247
Oh, no. I'm trying to help<i> you.</i>

01:55.249 --> 01:57.583
There's a better way
to do your job.

01:57.585 --> 01:58.884
Is there?

01:58.886 --> 02:00.385
You should wear gloves

02:00.387 --> 02:02.254
so that we can see your hands
when you gesture.

02:02.256 --> 02:04.389
Much safer. Think about it.

02:04.391 --> 02:07.659
Have you ever seen a dead mime
in the street?

02:07.661 --> 02:10.729
(school bell ringing)

02:10.731 --> 02:12.064
What is that?

02:12.066 --> 02:13.732
Well, it's the sun.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.567
Not our sun.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.569
Well, I heard the moon
is made out of cheese.

02:17.571 --> 02:19.138
You balance me out, J.J.

02:19.140 --> 02:21.340
That's why we're best friends.

02:24.411 --> 02:25.644
Hi, Mrs. Huang.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.079
It's five days till my birthday!

02:27.081 --> 02:28.914
Okay, thank you, J.J.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.916
Tomorrow, it'll be four days.

02:30.918 --> 02:34.453
Go to your own car now, J.J.
Bye.

02:34.455 --> 02:36.622
Evan: I can't wait
for J.J.'s birthday party.

02:36.624 --> 02:39.458
There's talk of
a Grover ice-cream cake!

02:39.460 --> 02:42.461
Oh, and look what I got
on my science test.

02:42.463 --> 02:44.396
Oh. An A-plus.

02:46.433 --> 02:49.168
There it is! (Laughs)

02:49.170 --> 02:51.436
Nice work, my angel!

02:51.872 --> 02:55.774
Louis, you old sneak!

02:55.776 --> 02:58.310
Signing up for
the North Orlando Chili Cook-Off

02:58.312 --> 03:00.379
without telling me,
you son of a gun!

03:00.381 --> 03:02.614
Marvin, I didn't know
you were a chili man.

03:02.616 --> 03:03.849
You see this bad boy?

03:03.851 --> 03:05.717
It's for cooking the wild boar

03:05.719 --> 03:08.120
that's in my famous
Navy Razorback Chili.

03:08.122 --> 03:10.122
Sounds pretty good. Pretty good?

03:10.124 --> 03:12.991
My wild pig brew has won
the last five Golden Stockpots.

03:12.993 --> 03:15.160
You know,
I'm not stranger to the ladle.

03:15.162 --> 03:17.796
I, uh, won a few chili contests
myself back in D.C.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.331
Oh, is that right? Mm-hmm.

03:19.333 --> 03:20.899
Well, down here in Orlando,

03:20.901 --> 03:22.701
we have a name for Yankee chili.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.369
It's called "soup."

03:25.339 --> 03:28.307
(both laugh)

03:28.309 --> 03:31.210
You know what I think when I
eat Southern chili? What?

03:31.212 --> 03:34.479
I think, "This could use
a little Northern chili."

03:34.481 --> 03:37.549
¶¶

03:39.920 --> 03:43.255
So, I point to the old man's
shopping cart, and I say,

03:43.257 --> 03:46.558
"You're supposed to get
frozen foods last, not first."

03:46.560 --> 03:47.993
If that meat defrosts,

03:47.995 --> 03:50.262
"you could get salmonella
and die."

03:50.264 --> 03:52.831
You do have an eye
for other people's mistakes.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.266
Thank you.

03:55.035 --> 03:58.437
(door closes)
Anyone see my apron?!

03:58.439 --> 04:00.005
Don't mind him.

04:00.007 --> 04:02.441
Louis just gets obsessed
with these chili competitions.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.909
You don't have to tell me.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.844
Chili season's got my man, too.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.212
Really? Yeah.

04:07.214 --> 04:08.580
I have to go help him clean out

04:08.582 --> 04:10.382
our garage fridge
to store a pig.

04:10.384 --> 04:13.385
He insists on the head
facing out.

04:13.387 --> 04:15.220
He says it honors the hog.

04:15.222 --> 04:16.355
Oh. I'll see you in a bit.

04:16.357 --> 04:18.056
Okay. Bye.

04:18.058 --> 04:20.726
After dinner, can we watch
"Caroline in the City"?

04:20.728 --> 04:22.361
What? No way.

04:22.363 --> 04:25.530
(speaking Chinese)

04:25.532 --> 04:28.767
Louis: Eddie, you won't be
watching any TV this week.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.203
You'll be helping me win

04:31.205 --> 04:34.539
the North Orlando
Chili Cook-Off...

04:34.541 --> 04:36.408
as my apprentice.

04:36.410 --> 04:37.909
Really?! You never let me help.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.578
You said I have to be
five pots tall.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.246
You are now, son.

04:41.248 --> 04:44.249
I'm so excited for you.
(chuckles)

04:44.251 --> 04:46.318
You're giving me your apron?

04:46.320 --> 04:47.653
Yes, to hand-wash for me,

04:47.655 --> 04:50.135
and then you'll
give it back to me.

04:51.592 --> 04:54.326
Can we drink something else
besides water at dinner?

04:54.328 --> 04:55.627
No. Water hydrates you.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.296
And if you spill it,
it cleans, not stains.

04:57.298 --> 04:58.563
Very well.

04:58.565 --> 04:59.898
One final question.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.933
Dad, can I have
your old briefcase?

05:01.935 --> 05:04.269
Why? I'd like to start

05:04.271 --> 05:06.638
carrying it to school
to keep my papers crisp.

05:06.640 --> 05:10.080
But you already have a backpack. I
didn't have a briefcase until I was 30.

05:10.577 --> 05:12.811
(school bell rings)

05:15.582 --> 05:18.617
(speaking Chinese)

05:18.619 --> 05:20.118
If you hate this so much,

05:20.120 --> 05:22.120
why do you insist on
coming along?

05:22.122 --> 05:24.089
(speaking Chinese)

05:29.930 --> 05:31.129
(sighs)

05:31.131 --> 05:33.665
And now it is my turn.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.968
Hey, it was my turn!

05:36.970 --> 05:38.770
She didn't zipper!

05:38.772 --> 05:40.872
(horn blares) Hey!

05:40.874 --> 05:42.174
Hey, you didn't zipper!

05:42.176 --> 05:45.143
Hey. She didn't zipper!

05:45.145 --> 05:47.546
It's out of my un-gloved hands.

05:49.149 --> 05:51.383
Watch the car.

05:52.486 --> 05:56.054
¶<i> Life never tells us</i> ¶ Hey!

05:56.056 --> 05:58.824
¶<i> The whens or whys</i> ¶ Hey!
I know you see me!

05:58.826 --> 06:00.959
¶<i> When you've got friends</i> ¶
You cut me off

06:00.961 --> 06:03.028
when it was my turn to zipper!

06:03.030 --> 06:06.164
¶<i> To wish you well</i> ¶ That's
not how we drive around here!

06:06.166 --> 06:07.699
¶<i> You'll find a point when</i> ¶
There's no zippering rule.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.167
It's more of a suggestion.

06:09.169 --> 06:10.168
Calm down.

06:10.170 --> 06:11.370
¶<i> You will exhale</i> ¶

06:11.372 --> 06:14.206
"Calm down"? <i>You</i> calm down!

06:14.208 --> 06:16.308
¶<i> Shoop, shoop, shoop</i> ¶ You know what?
Get out of the car.

06:16.310 --> 06:17.743
¶<i> Shoo-be, doop, shoop, shoop</i> ¶

06:17.745 --> 06:19.378
Help, help, I'm being attacked!

06:19.380 --> 06:20.912
You're not being attacked.

06:20.914 --> 06:23.215
She's not being attacked.

06:23.217 --> 06:25.384
Nobody help this idiot.

06:25.386 --> 06:26.818
You are a crazy lady.

06:26.820 --> 06:27.919
I can't believe somebody

06:27.921 --> 06:29.354
gave you a driver's license

06:29.356 --> 06:32.224
because you're an unfit driver
and an idiot.

06:32.226 --> 06:33.291
Evan: Mommy?

06:35.195 --> 06:37.929
J.J.: Oh, hi, mom. Hi, J.J.

06:37.931 --> 06:40.632
Oh. Hi, Mrs. Huang. Hi, J.J.

06:48.675 --> 06:50.675
You don't have to drive
all the way up to school.

06:50.677 --> 06:52.210
You can just drop us off here.

06:52.212 --> 06:55.180
Jessica: Here? Why?
It's just calmer here.

06:55.182 --> 06:58.049
Is this about yesterday?

06:58.051 --> 07:00.051
Listen, sometimes
when one adult is right,

07:00.053 --> 07:01.620
they have to tell
the other adult

07:01.622 --> 07:02.754
that they're wrong.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.756
But that was
my best friend's mom.

07:04.758 --> 07:07.426
Well, she drives like
your<i> worst</i> friend's mom.

07:07.428 --> 07:10.028
(chuckles)

07:10.030 --> 07:11.530
The traffic disputes of adults

07:11.532 --> 07:13.892
have no impact on
the friendships of children.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.635
(school bell rings)

07:16.637 --> 07:18.637
Of course.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.906
Bye, mom.

07:20.908 --> 07:23.308
Emery: Bye, mom. Bye.

07:23.310 --> 07:24.443
Hey, Evan.

07:24.445 --> 07:26.411
Hi, J.J.

07:26.413 --> 07:28.213
You have a raisin on your neck.

07:28.215 --> 07:29.347
Oh.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.497
It's from breakfast. Ha!

07:37.791 --> 07:39.324
Good.
Now I have your fingerprints

07:39.326 --> 07:41.126
in case I need to send them
to the state.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.461
Evan's not invited to

07:42.463 --> 07:44.863
J.J.'s birthday party
this weekend.

07:49.403 --> 07:53.472
Son, welcome to the flavor dome.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.007
Cool. When do we eat.

07:56.009 --> 07:58.276
When the chili
tells us it's ready.

07:58.278 --> 08:00.445
This is the start
of a family legacy,

08:00.447 --> 08:02.314
like when an Italian grandmother

08:02.316 --> 08:03.982
passes down a meatball recipe.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.150
It's like, um,

08:05.152 --> 08:06.485
[Italian accent] "Mama Louis!"

08:06.487 --> 08:09.187
(normal voice) Now, let's start

08:09.189 --> 08:11.923
by chopping up these onions.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.258
Whoa.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.926
You're gonna let me
use this knife?

08:14.928 --> 08:17.288
Of course. You're my apprentice.

08:19.366 --> 08:21.032
Any last words?

08:21.034 --> 08:24.035
Uh, maybe we work on
some knife skills first, okay?

08:24.037 --> 08:25.470
All right.

08:25.472 --> 08:28.507
¶¶

08:39.486 --> 08:42.554
(both blowing)

08:49.530 --> 08:50.896
Not bad. Not bad at all.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.631
(screams) What are you doing?

08:52.633 --> 08:53.965
We spent forever on that!

08:55.702 --> 08:57.502
Eddie, what were
your first words

08:57.504 --> 08:58.837
after you tried the chili?

08:58.839 --> 09:00.138
I said, "Not bad."

09:00.140 --> 09:01.039
Exactly.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.340
"Not bad" isn't good enough.

09:02.342 --> 09:04.509
And "good" isn't good enough,
either.

09:04.511 --> 09:07.679
Marvin is out there
cooking a wild boar right now...

09:07.681 --> 09:09.748
A pig from the forest.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.383
We need to reach higher

09:11.385 --> 09:13.985
if we want that Golden Stockpot.

09:13.987 --> 09:16.221
Okay, dad,
if we're making this again,

09:16.223 --> 09:19.391
I think we should toast some
cumin in some bacon fat

09:19.393 --> 09:20.559
before we put the meat in.

09:20.561 --> 09:21.993
Let me stop you right there.

09:21.995 --> 09:24.396
You know why your mom's
not allowed in the dome?

09:24.398 --> 09:25.397
Because she futzes.

09:25.399 --> 09:26.665
She adds things.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.567
"Oh, how about
a little more oregano?

09:28.569 --> 09:30.268
Let's add a sprig of rosemary."

09:30.270 --> 09:33.238
No! This isn't a bowl of jazz!

09:36.209 --> 09:38.209
Who does that woman
think she is,

09:38.211 --> 09:41.713
deciding who can and can't
attend her son's birthday party?

09:41.715 --> 09:43.214
She's not God.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.783
That's nice.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.718
Stop thinking about your chili!

09:46.720 --> 09:48.787
How am I supposed to tell Evan

09:48.789 --> 09:51.356
he's not invited to
J.J.'s birthday party?

09:51.358 --> 09:53.091
Just apologize to her.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.293
Why would<i> I</i> apologize?

09:55.295 --> 09:57.195
She didn't zipper!

09:57.197 --> 09:59.030
She's the one who's wrong!

09:59.032 --> 10:00.198
Well, what would be wrong

10:00.200 --> 10:01.433
is if Evan
didn't go to the party

10:01.435 --> 10:02.801
because of something <i>you</i> did.

10:02.803 --> 10:06.037
Honey: (screams)
Damn it, Marvin!

10:06.039 --> 10:08.306
Get this beast
out of the garage fridge!

10:08.308 --> 10:10.188
Marvin:
We need to honor the hog!

10:18.385 --> 10:20.285
(sighs)

10:23.056 --> 10:24.556
Let's start over.

10:24.558 --> 10:27.025
I'm Jessica, Evan's mother.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.260
I'm Helen.

10:29.262 --> 10:31.563
Helen. That's a pretty name.

10:31.565 --> 10:34.966
It's like melon, a sweet fruit.

10:34.968 --> 10:39.237
I'm here because
I would like to...

10:39.239 --> 10:42.841
acknowledge a mutual wrongdoing.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.776
Okay...

10:44.778 --> 10:46.678
You didn't respect the zipper,

10:46.680 --> 10:49.080
and I lost my temper,

10:49.082 --> 10:51.402
even though I was provoked
by your error.

10:52.919 --> 10:55.086
I think I'm being pretty clear.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.922
You're not.

10:57.924 --> 11:01.493
(sighs)
It is for Evan, my angel.

11:03.697 --> 11:06.297
I am sorry.

11:06.299 --> 11:09.367
Thank you very much
for saying that.

11:09.369 --> 11:10.869
I-I accept your apology.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.937
(chuckles)

11:12.939 --> 11:16.041
Oh, I am so glad
we put this behind us.

11:16.043 --> 11:19.544
Evan is so excited
for J.J.'s birthday party.

11:19.546 --> 11:21.780
Oh, Evan still isn't invited.
Bye, now.

11:23.383 --> 11:27.052
¶¶

11:27.054 --> 11:29.287
Eddie! Why didn't you tell me?

11:29.289 --> 11:31.956
Tell you what? About your
dad competing in NO-CO!

11:31.958 --> 11:34.826
The North Orlando
Chili Cook-Off.

11:34.828 --> 11:37.148
Yeah, he's been making me
help him out.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.197
Hold on.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.832
He's letting you
chili apprentice?

11:40.834 --> 11:43.001
All we do is cook chili
and not eat any of it.

11:43.003 --> 11:45.336
He keeps on saying
it needs to be better,

11:45.338 --> 11:47.405
but he doesn't take
any of my ideas.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.007
You believe this guy?

11:49.009 --> 11:51.176
Two days in a chili kitchen,
thinks he knows everything.

11:51.178 --> 11:53.378
Why would your dad
listen to you?

11:53.380 --> 11:54.546
You're not a chef.

11:54.548 --> 11:56.047
Yeah, but I know food.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.382
Blindfold me
in a Baskin-Robbins,

11:57.384 --> 11:58.583
and I'll name all 31 flavors.

11:58.585 --> 12:00.051
You're the apprentice.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.553
You're supposed to shut up,
listen, and learn.

12:01.555 --> 12:03.254
But I'm not good
at any of those things.

12:03.256 --> 12:04.989
Forget this.

12:04.991 --> 12:07.311
I'm done cooking with my dad.

12:08.028 --> 12:09.728
(scoffs)

12:09.730 --> 12:11.496
You need to take that attitude
to a pie-eating contest

12:11.498 --> 12:13.398
where it belongs!

12:18.338 --> 12:20.739
Mom, which outfit
should I wear to J.J.'s?

12:20.741 --> 12:23.074
I want something
I can knock around in,

12:23.076 --> 12:25.210
but my knees
have been ashy lately,

12:25.212 --> 12:26.911
so shorts are out.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.446
(sighs)

12:28.448 --> 12:29.848
Evan, sit down.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.249
There's something
I have to tell you.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.371
What is it?

12:33.553 --> 12:34.619
I...

12:36.957 --> 12:39.958
I have to get gas
on the way to J.J.'s.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.360
Oh, then we need to leave
10 minutes earlier.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.762
I better hustle into the shower.

12:46.566 --> 12:49.267
The Mobil on 5th is 10 cents cheaper.
(screams)

12:49.269 --> 12:51.603
Emery, we have to get you
a cat bell.

12:51.605 --> 12:54.305
Announce yourself
when I come into the room.

12:54.307 --> 12:55.874
Good God!

12:55.876 --> 12:57.776
Ohh! Hmm.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.110
(doorbell rings)

12:59.112 --> 13:00.912
(indistinct conversations)

13:00.914 --> 13:02.447
Hello, Helen. Evan is here.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.983
You guys, I'm here!

13:06.253 --> 13:07.585
What are you doing?

13:07.587 --> 13:09.087
You can't just crash
my son's birthday party.

13:09.089 --> 13:10.889
Evan doesn't deserve to miss out

13:10.891 --> 13:12.757
because you have a problem
with me.

13:12.759 --> 13:14.559
We shouldn't make this about us.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.995
No, we shouldn't,
because it's not about us.

13:16.997 --> 13:17.929
It's about Evan.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.464
What are you talking about.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.999
(scoffs)

13:21.001 --> 13:22.500
That's why
I didn't want him here.

13:22.502 --> 13:23.635
See for yourself.

13:23.637 --> 13:24.969
Evan: No, no, no, no, no.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.571
You're doing it wrong.

13:26.573 --> 13:29.407
What are pirate Lego men doing

13:29.409 --> 13:31.176
at a construction site?

13:31.178 --> 13:33.178
Tear this down and start again.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.312
Okay!

13:35.148 --> 13:36.481
My son is a gentle spirit,

13:36.483 --> 13:38.316
and I don't like the way
your son treats him.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.118
That's why
I didn't want him here.

13:40.120 --> 13:44.122
My job is to protect J.J.
from your little bossy boots.

13:44.124 --> 13:46.124
Evan's not bossy boots!

13:46.126 --> 13:47.692
He's angel boots!

13:47.694 --> 13:48.827
(scoffs)

13:48.829 --> 13:51.963
What... on earth... is<i> that?</i>

13:51.965 --> 13:54.045
It's the...
Don't say it's the sun.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.708
Evan was really
bossing his friend around?

14:03.710 --> 14:06.611
Sweet little Evan
in his cute, little khakis?

14:06.613 --> 14:08.546
The ones with the pleats, yes.

14:08.548 --> 14:12.016
I just don't know where he
learns this type of behavior.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.751
You're kidding, right?

14:14.688 --> 14:16.621
He gets it from you, Jessica.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.556
What?! No, he doesn't.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.124
Yes, he does.

14:20.126 --> 14:22.126
I think
he just looks up to you...

14:22.128 --> 14:23.795
You're not doing it right.

14:23.797 --> 14:25.330
Sorry? Your sandwich...

14:25.332 --> 14:27.832
The mustard needs
to go on the bread first

14:27.834 --> 14:30.835
to form a moisture barrier
between it and the tomato.

14:30.837 --> 14:33.118
Tear it down. Start again.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.407
Oh, my God.

14:37.177 --> 14:40.011
You've never made
a proper sandwich.

14:40.013 --> 14:42.280
Or you're bossy.

14:43.216 --> 14:46.751
You just love pointing out
people's mistakes.

14:46.753 --> 14:49.254
I thought that was a compliment.

14:49.256 --> 14:50.555
¶¶

14:50.557 --> 14:53.491
Gus: Good afternoon, Orlando.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.226
This is "Good Morning, Orlando."

14:55.228 --> 14:56.828
And let me tell you, Mey-Mey,

14:56.830 --> 14:58.897
we are having an awful lot
of fun here at NO-CO.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.164
(chuckles)

15:00.166 --> 15:01.699
Not really, Gus,
but what can you do?

15:01.701 --> 15:03.201
You got to go
where they send you.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.236
(chuckles)
Now let's meet the judges

15:05.238 --> 15:08.406
who will be awarding
the coveted Golden Stockpot

15:08.408 --> 15:09.274
to the winner.

15:09.276 --> 15:10.541
Hi. Hello!

15:10.543 --> 15:11.776
(both laugh)

15:11.778 --> 15:13.111
It's us. That's right.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.280
Not only are we reporting
on the chili,

15:15.282 --> 15:16.714
but we're also judging it.

15:16.716 --> 15:20.385
Ohh, things are about to get
<i>caliente!</i>

15:20.387 --> 15:23.521
I see you brought
your Golden Stockpots.

15:23.523 --> 15:27.091
Ah, I only brought them
to hold down my banner.

15:27.093 --> 15:29.427
(chuckles)

15:29.429 --> 15:31.562
Are you posing for a picture,
Marvin?

15:31.564 --> 15:33.965
Oh, just in case
someone wants to take one.

15:35.068 --> 15:36.935
Here you go. Ha. Thanks.

15:36.937 --> 15:39.070
Mm-hmm. Official list of
all your competitors.

15:39.072 --> 15:40.571
Good luck.

15:40.573 --> 15:43.241
Wow, there's a lot of entries
on here.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.243
Big Daddy Huang?

15:45.245 --> 15:47.885
That's not right. I'm Louis' Five Alarm.
Eddie: That's me.

15:48.882 --> 15:50.248
I'm Big Daddy Huang.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.583
What? Sorry, dad.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.319
I'm done being your apprentice.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.587
We've been cooking
for three days.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.056
Exactly.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.757
And you didn't take
a single one of my ideas.

15:59.759 --> 16:00.825
I'm not about that.

16:00.827 --> 16:02.894
I got to break these chains.

16:02.896 --> 16:05.129
Fine, you want to make
your own chili?

16:05.131 --> 16:08.232
Like the French candle says
in "Beauty and the Beast,"

16:08.234 --> 16:09.968
"Be My Guest."

16:09.970 --> 16:12.403
¶ Everybody over here ¶
¶ Get on up ¶

16:12.405 --> 16:14.238
¶ Everybody right there ¶
¶ Get into it ¶

16:14.240 --> 16:16.574
¶ Everybody over there ¶
¶ Get involved ¶

16:16.576 --> 16:18.609
¶ Everybody just, ohh ¶

16:18.611 --> 16:20.845
Man (rapping): ¶ Microphone
check, Microphone check ¶

16:20.847 --> 16:22.780
¶ Can I get a check-up
from the neck up? ¶

16:22.782 --> 16:25.016
¶ Can I kick a rhyme
while I'm checkin' my time? ¶

16:25.018 --> 16:27.352
¶ Can I get cure 'cause you did
the crime for sure? ¶

16:27.354 --> 16:30.154
¶ You're probably killin' me
with these shots ¶

16:30.156 --> 16:32.190
¶ Tell me what I got
and I'm gone ¶

16:32.192 --> 16:33.758
¶ Pandemic, who did it? ¶

16:33.760 --> 16:35.360
¶ Right, who did it?
That's who did it ¶

16:35.362 --> 16:38.296
¶ Who? World Health Organized,
murderized ¶

16:38.298 --> 16:40.098
¶ Came to the aid and got paid ¶

16:40.100 --> 16:42.633
¶ Doctor, doctor in a lab
concocted a germ warfare...¶

16:42.635 --> 16:45.555
Emery, go get us some Tums
from the Tums tent. On it.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.272
(sighs)

16:48.274 --> 16:50.441
Let's sit down for a minute,
okay?

16:52.879 --> 16:55.179
I saw you at J.J.'s party.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.280
I saw you, too.

16:56.282 --> 16:57.715
You brought me there.

16:57.717 --> 17:00.551
No, I mean I saw the way
you were talking to him,

17:00.553 --> 17:02.286
bossing him around like that,

17:02.288 --> 17:03.788
forcing him to start over,

17:03.790 --> 17:05.623
making him change his outfit.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.025
Oh.

17:07.027 --> 17:09.027
And I know why.

17:09.029 --> 17:12.797
You're trying to be like me
because you worship me.

17:12.799 --> 17:13.998
No, I don't.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.500
Yes, you do. I don't.

17:15.502 --> 17:17.835
You do. You worship your mommy.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.504
I am your shining star,

17:19.506 --> 17:21.205
and you want to be just like me.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.241
Why else would you boss
your friend around like that?

17:23.243 --> 17:24.542
I don't know.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.144
I guess because
he listens to me.

17:26.146 --> 17:27.311
What do you mean?

17:27.313 --> 17:29.313
No one at home ever
listens to me.

17:29.315 --> 17:30.648
Of course we do.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.083
We listen to you.

17:32.085 --> 17:33.418
No, you don't.

17:33.420 --> 17:34.819
After dinner, can we watch

17:34.821 --> 17:35.753
"Caroline in the City"?

17:35.755 --> 17:37.088
What? No way.

17:37.090 --> 17:39.257
Dad, can I have
your old briefcase?

17:39.259 --> 17:42.579
But you already have a backpack. I
didn't have a briefcase until I was 30.

17:42.996 --> 17:45.063
(speaking Chinese)

17:45.065 --> 17:46.397
Huh?

17:47.000 --> 17:49.400
(speaking Chinese) The Garfield.

17:49.936 --> 17:51.669
Why didn't you tell me
you felt this way?

17:51.671 --> 17:53.638
Because you wouldn't have
listened.

17:55.542 --> 17:58.109
I guess sometimes it's hard
being the youngest.

18:01.181 --> 18:04.115
Hey. I know how you feel.

18:04.117 --> 18:07.919
Your Aunt Connie
never listened to me.

18:07.921 --> 18:10.188
That's why her life
is such a mess now.

18:10.190 --> 18:11.622
(chuckles)

18:11.624 --> 18:15.026
I bought all
the regular-strength Tums.

18:15.028 --> 18:16.694
Exchange them
for Extra Strength?

18:16.696 --> 18:17.829
Yes.

18:19.199 --> 18:21.699
(indistinct conversations)

18:21.701 --> 18:24.068
Where are all
your measuring cups?

18:24.070 --> 18:25.670
Up here. Want a taste?

18:31.711 --> 18:32.643
What's wrong?

18:32.645 --> 18:34.378
Eddie, that's delicious.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.148
There's no way you made this
from scratch.

18:37.150 --> 18:38.316
(bell clanging)

18:38.318 --> 18:39.417
Gus: Gather around.

18:39.419 --> 18:40.485
Where's the intern?

18:40.487 --> 18:42.220
I need another towel.

18:42.222 --> 18:43.321
Ashley!

18:43.323 --> 18:44.589
All right, everyone,

18:44.591 --> 18:46.657
before we announce
our finalists,

18:46.659 --> 18:48.826
we have some unfortunate news.

18:48.828 --> 18:50.928
An entrant has been disqualified

18:50.930 --> 18:52.897
for using pre-cooked meat.
I knew it.

18:52.899 --> 18:54.232
(crowd murmurs)

18:54.234 --> 18:55.933
That's right, Gus.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.101
It's Marvin!

18:57.103 --> 18:58.970
(crowd murmurs)

18:58.972 --> 19:00.738
Apparently,
Marvin not only told us,

19:00.740 --> 19:02.940
but fed us...

19:02.942 --> 19:04.008
a Whopper.

19:04.010 --> 19:05.143
(crowd booing)

19:05.145 --> 19:06.344
I did it for the chili.

19:06.346 --> 19:07.945
Take him away. (Spits)

19:07.947 --> 19:10.648
I can walk.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.284
You all ate it and loved it!

19:13.286 --> 19:15.119
None of us are innocent.

19:15.121 --> 19:17.288
And now let's move on to
the three finalists.

19:17.290 --> 19:20.158
First we have...

19:20.160 --> 19:21.926
Louis' Five Alarm!

19:21.928 --> 19:24.095
Yeah, Louis! (Laughs) Delicious.

19:24.097 --> 19:27.031
(cheers and applause) Next
we have Big Daddy Huang!

19:27.033 --> 19:28.666
Whoo! (Cheers and applause)

19:28.668 --> 19:30.701
And lastly, Gloria's Chili!

19:30.703 --> 19:33.871
Whoo! Gloria! Gloria!

19:33.873 --> 19:38.342
And the Golden Stockpot
goes to...

19:45.652 --> 19:47.518
Looks great, doesn't it?

19:47.520 --> 19:50.121
I can't believe Gloria
just gave it to us.

19:50.123 --> 19:52.456
Well, lucky for us,
she thinks pride is a sin.

19:52.458 --> 19:55.059
Hmm. You know, I have to say

19:55.061 --> 19:57.061
I was really impressed
with your chili.

19:57.063 --> 19:58.896
Really?! How'd you
learn to do that?

19:58.898 --> 20:00.731
I guess I just know food.

20:00.733 --> 20:03.234
Thanks for teaching me
the basics.

20:03.236 --> 20:04.402
Oh, the basics?

20:04.404 --> 20:05.836
(chuckles) Okay.

20:05.838 --> 20:08.539
It has been
brought to my attention

20:08.541 --> 20:12.510
that Evan feels like nobody
listens to him around here.

20:12.512 --> 20:14.145
So tonight,

20:14.147 --> 20:16.480
he gets to choose
what we drink with dinner.

20:16.482 --> 20:17.582
Really?

20:17.584 --> 20:19.083
Why does he get to choose?

20:19.085 --> 20:22.253
(speaking Chinese)

20:22.255 --> 20:25.089
You will all drink what Evan
decides, and you will like it!

20:25.091 --> 20:26.691
Okay, go ahead, Evan.

20:26.693 --> 20:28.159
Anything you want.

20:28.161 --> 20:30.561
I choose...

20:30.563 --> 20:31.662
Shirley Temples.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.764
Ohh. What is that?

20:33.766 --> 20:35.866
It's 7-Up with grenadine
and cherries.

20:35.868 --> 20:38.269
I don't have
any of those ingredients, so...

20:38.271 --> 20:40.004
Then we'll just have
passion fruit nectar.

20:41.207 --> 20:42.406
Strawberry Fanta?

20:43.376 --> 20:45.009
Ginger Fizz-Bit?

20:46.212 --> 20:47.212
(groans)

20:52.252 --> 20:53.784
Hi, J.J.

20:53.786 --> 20:54.952
Hi, Evan.

20:54.954 --> 20:58.089
It's 362 days until my birthday.

20:58.091 --> 20:59.357
I'll time out my haircuts

20:59.359 --> 21:00.791
so I can get one the day before.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.860
Oh.

21:02.862 --> 21:05.363
What do you think?
It's a picture of my brother.

21:05.365 --> 21:08.532
We can't have a dog
because of his allergies.

21:08.534 --> 21:09.867
I like it.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.636
Really?

21:11.638 --> 21:13.938
You don't think there's
anything I should change?

21:13.940 --> 21:15.140
No, it's great.

21:19.912 --> 21:21.646
Nice hard backpack.

21:21.648 --> 21:22.747
It's a briefcase.

21:22.749 --> 21:25.283
(laughing)
