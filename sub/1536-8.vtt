00:01.160 --> 00:02.810
Previously on Grimm...

00:03.080 --> 00:04.241
What I saw...

00:06.040 --> 00:07.201
...felt real.

00:07.280 --> 00:09.328
Nobody sees the
world the same way.

00:09.400 --> 00:10.811
- What is it?
- A Wolfsangel.

00:10.880 --> 00:11.881
Why?

00:11.960 --> 00:13.769
The Secundum
Naturae Ordinem Wesen.

00:13.840 --> 00:17.242
To them, intermarriage is a
crime against man and nature.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.521
What's wrong?

00:20.600 --> 00:22.520
Just a little bit of nausea.
It's not a big deal.

00:22.560 --> 00:24.005
It's just happened
a couple of times.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.242
Are you
possibly pregnant?

00:29.640 --> 00:33.440
"Cuide su rebano,
nunca deje su lado.

00:33.520 --> 00:37.844
"Cuide su sangre,
el Chupacabra tiene hambre."

00:41.000 --> 00:44.322
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

00:47.120 --> 00:49.566
Fever's down,
less ache-y.

00:49.640 --> 00:51.688
She should be okay
in a couple of days.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.410
Make sure she stays
in bed and hydrated.

00:53.480 --> 00:55.482
Our flight's in a couple
hours, we gotta get going.

00:55.560 --> 00:56.641
Just a couple
of more patients.

00:56.720 --> 00:58.324
We're going
to miss the plane.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.689
Everything will be fine,
don't worry.

01:00.760 --> 01:02.400
If you need anything,
the nurse will help.

01:02.600 --> 01:03.840
Gracias, doctor.

01:06.280 --> 01:07.805
We can't rid
the entire world

01:07.920 --> 01:10.082
of disease in
one trip, Diego.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.527
It's gonna take
at least two.

01:16.360 --> 01:18.408
It'll be nice to
sleep in my own bed.

01:18.480 --> 01:21.086
Actually just
be nice to sleep.

01:21.720 --> 01:23.882
And to be back home.

01:23.960 --> 01:25.769
And to see
my beautiful wife.

01:25.840 --> 01:28.127
Okay, can you not rub in the wife part?

01:28.200 --> 01:30.487
Quit breaking up
with your girlfriends. Ah!

01:30.560 --> 01:32.164
I won't miss
the mosquitoes.

01:32.240 --> 01:34.163
Yeah, well,
they'll miss me.

01:35.760 --> 01:38.411
PORTLAND

02:03.120 --> 02:04.849
You were gone
too long this time.

02:04.920 --> 02:06.160
I'm not letting
you leave again.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.330
Fine by me.

02:11.880 --> 02:13.405
So, how was it?

02:13.840 --> 02:15.171
Sisyphean.

02:15.960 --> 02:18.008
You were just pushing
rocks up a hill?

02:18.080 --> 02:19.411
Seems like.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.165
Have you had
any sleep?

02:22.240 --> 02:23.480
Yeah.

02:23.560 --> 02:26.450
I don't remember when,
but I did have some.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.011
Listen, the next
time you do this,

02:28.080 --> 02:30.287
you gotta take
better care of yourself.

02:30.360 --> 02:31.600
You look exhausted.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.842
I sort of
feel like it, too.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.764
But you are making me
feel better already.

02:39.240 --> 02:41.049
Are you hungry?
I made lasagna.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.849
Italian, good.

02:42.920 --> 02:44.922
No more
arroz y frijoles.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.844
And after you eat, I'm
putting you right to bed.

02:47.920 --> 02:49.843
As long as
you're coming with me.

02:50.240 --> 02:52.049
The big one or
the medium one?

02:52.120 --> 02:53.400
How much are we
gonna be wearing?

02:53.440 --> 02:55.841
I mean, this is
a honeymoon.

02:55.920 --> 03:00.608
I'm bringing the big one,
just in case we buy stuff.

03:00.720 --> 03:02.609
What are you looking for?
My old camera.

03:02.680 --> 03:04.205
Well, that doesn't
really narrow it down.

03:04.280 --> 03:05.850
Yeah, but this is
my uncle's 1935

03:05.920 --> 03:08.526
Ernst Leitz
Wetzlar Leica DRP

03:08.600 --> 03:10.967
with a Wetzlar Summar
five centimeter lens.

03:11.040 --> 03:12.166
TMI.

03:12.240 --> 03:13.401
Sorry.

03:14.600 --> 03:17.570
But we cannot succumb to
digital on our honeymoon.

03:17.640 --> 03:19.608
Where'd you last see it?

03:19.720 --> 03:22.451
Wherever I put it,
which is why I can't find it.

03:22.520 --> 03:25.046
Hey. Honey, don't
worry, we'll find it.

03:25.120 --> 03:26.724
I know. It's just, I don't know.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.689
You don't know what?

03:28.760 --> 03:29.761
I just, I wish we
could leave on a trip

03:29.840 --> 03:30.841
and not feel like
something's gonna

03:30.920 --> 03:33.321
go horribly wrong
while we're gone.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.442
Well, on the
glass half full side,

03:35.520 --> 03:37.887
we won't be here.

03:37.960 --> 03:39.724
Hey, if you and I
don't make

03:39.800 --> 03:41.086
time to go on
this honeymoon,

03:41.160 --> 03:43.401
then we will always find a
reason not to go on it.

03:43.480 --> 03:44.641
I know, but...
But what?

03:44.720 --> 03:45.960
Other people
don't have reasons

03:46.040 --> 03:47.963
like scalp-coat-wearing
madmen,

03:48.080 --> 03:49.605
or the zombie apocalypse!

03:49.680 --> 03:51.091
Or Hexenbiest hell.
Right.

03:51.160 --> 03:52.400
Or the Umkippen!

03:52.480 --> 03:55.290
See? And we're just getting started.

03:55.360 --> 03:59.285
Look, we have to trust that they
have this under control without us.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.405
I know.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.768
You're right.
Yeah.

04:06.600 --> 04:09.968
You know, I can't remember
the last time we did this.

04:10.360 --> 04:12.249
What, eat take-out
and drink beer?

04:12.320 --> 04:14.004
Don't we do this,
like, four times a week?

04:14.080 --> 04:15.684
No!

04:15.760 --> 04:17.887
Have the house
to ourselves.

04:18.160 --> 04:19.446
on, yeah.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.730
Hey, this is exactly
what we were eating

04:21.800 --> 04:23.450
the first night
Trubel was here.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.761
Guess we're kind
of empty nesters.

04:25.840 --> 04:27.126
I hope she's okay.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.611
She's fine.

04:28.680 --> 04:29.681
Ooh.

04:30.120 --> 04:31.167
I'm gonna miss her.

04:31.240 --> 04:32.241
Me too.

04:32.320 --> 04:35.767
But if she was here, we
wouldn't have enough food.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.046
That is true.

04:37.120 --> 04:38.121
What are we gonna
do now that we have

04:38.200 --> 04:41.010
the whole refrigerator
to ourselves?

04:41.080 --> 04:42.844
And the house.

04:42.920 --> 04:44.365
Let me think.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.610
Hey, come on. Stop it,
it's just a squirrel.

06:09.960 --> 06:12.247
Hey, hey! Panchito!

06:15.280 --> 06:16.611
Panchito!

06:20.640 --> 06:22.085
Panchito!

06:52.520 --> 06:53.646
AUSTRIA

06:53.720 --> 06:55.480
Nicholas
Burkhardt's mother is dead.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.409
Officially, that is.

06:57.520 --> 06:58.965
Just as the accident
was reported

06:59.040 --> 07:01.771
in the New York newspaper,
21 years ago.

07:01.840 --> 07:04.286
Bodies burned
beyond recognition.

07:04.400 --> 07:06.084
Because the heads
were missing,

07:06.160 --> 07:08.731
dental records
could not be obtained.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.450
Well, the woman who
took me and my baby

07:10.520 --> 07:12.761
to Nick's house
was Nick's mother,

07:12.840 --> 07:14.763
and she definitely
had her head.

07:14.840 --> 07:16.922
So she's been excellent
at covering her tracks.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.121
Better
than excellent.

07:18.200 --> 07:21.044
No one has been able to discover
anything about her since her death.

07:21.120 --> 07:24.124
Or if they have, they haven't
lived to tell about it.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.123
Except Adalind,
of course.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.123
Well, I wasn't
trying to kill her.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.884
Perhaps you
should have.

07:29.960 --> 07:31.325
You'd still
have your child.

07:31.760 --> 07:33.000
Would I?

07:34.120 --> 07:37.806
Probably not, but that's
beside the point.

07:37.880 --> 07:39.564
We're working together now.

07:39.640 --> 07:42.564
We trust one another.
Don't we?

07:44.400 --> 07:45.561
We do.

07:46.880 --> 07:49.201
So how do we
find my baby?

07:49.320 --> 07:52.403
Well, the last anyone
saw her was in Portland.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.160
Victims were
found this morning

08:30.280 --> 08:31.805
around 5:00 a.m.
by a neighbor.

08:32.159 --> 08:34.082
Victims? There's
more than one?

08:34.200 --> 08:35.929
Victim one, who
has been identified

08:36.000 --> 08:38.844
as Justin Murray,
was taking his dog,

08:38.919 --> 08:40.524
victim two,
for what appears to be

08:40.600 --> 08:42.328
a late night or
early morning walk

08:42.400 --> 08:43.686
when they were attacked.

08:43.760 --> 08:45.046
No witnesses yet.

08:45.120 --> 08:46.531
But we do have a lot
of neighbors who said

08:46.600 --> 08:50.002
they heard what they described
as growling and screaming.

08:53.760 --> 08:54.761
Ooh.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.680
Seems like their throats were
ripped open and the blood drained,

08:57.720 --> 08:59.802
judging by the fact there's not
a lot of blood on the ground.

08:59.880 --> 09:02.042
Looks like something
bit into his neck.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.883
And by "something"
you mean...

09:04.960 --> 09:08.009
It's not your average gunshot,
stabbing, bludgeoning.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.367
Uh, I'm not sure
I understand what average

09:10.440 --> 09:12.044
is anymore in this city.

09:12.120 --> 09:14.122
Not that I have any opinion that
makes sense 'cause, you know,

09:14.240 --> 09:15.730
I'm ready to go with
vampire or wolf man.

09:15.800 --> 09:17.564
Do I sound a little stressed?
Doesn't matter.

09:17.640 --> 09:18.926
Anyway...

09:19.400 --> 09:20.811
Neighbor found
them this morning.

09:20.880 --> 09:24.202
Recent immigrant from
Ecuador, Manuel Fierros.

09:24.280 --> 09:25.486
Mr. Fierros.

09:25.560 --> 09:26.686
Yes?

09:26.760 --> 09:29.445
This is Detective Burkhardt,
and Detective Griffin.

09:29.520 --> 09:31.602
They want to ask
you a few questions.

09:31.680 --> 09:32.681
You found the body?

09:32.800 --> 09:35.804
I find them
muy temprano.

09:35.880 --> 09:38.884
Is early. I call 911.

09:38.960 --> 09:43.522
I see run, walk him
every night with his dog.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.762
Do you live in
the neighborhood?

09:45.840 --> 09:47.444
I living with my cousin.

09:47.520 --> 09:48.760
Did you see
anything else unusual,

09:48.840 --> 09:51.002
any other people
or cars driving by?

09:51.080 --> 09:53.924
No, I did not see,
but I hear him scream.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.890
I was asleep and I hear him.

09:56.960 --> 09:59.406
I come outside and
find him, them muertos.

09:59.480 --> 10:01.005
All right.
Thank you, Mr. Fierros.

10:01.120 --> 10:04.169
If you can think of
anything else, please...

10:04.240 --> 10:05.605
But I know.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.081
What?

10:08.160 --> 10:10.288
I know what kill him.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.930
You said you didn't
see what happened.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.480
I did not see, I know.

10:16.200 --> 10:19.727
You see this?
Blood of man and animal.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.008
Es el Chupacabra.

10:24.440 --> 10:27.125
Uh, excuse me?
Chupacabra?

10:27.200 --> 10:29.009
The urban legend,
Chupacabra?

10:29.080 --> 10:30.969
That Chupacabra?

10:31.040 --> 10:33.691
Only Chupacabra
kill like this.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.651
Where were you? I woke
up and you were gone.

10:48.720 --> 10:50.051
I couldn't sleep.

10:50.120 --> 10:51.645
I didn't know
where you went.

10:51.720 --> 10:53.643
I tried calling you on your
cell, but you left it here.

10:53.720 --> 10:57.088
I needed to get some fresh
air, so I went for a walk.

10:57.160 --> 10:58.650
Without shoes?

10:59.760 --> 11:00.886
I didn't go far.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.008
Do you know what
happened back there?

11:03.080 --> 11:05.003
Somebody killed Justin.

11:06.200 --> 11:08.043
Oh, God.
Do they know who?

11:08.720 --> 11:11.451
I don't know.
I don't, I don't think so.

11:11.520 --> 11:12.726
I'm just so glad
you're back here.

11:12.800 --> 11:14.450
Don't ever do
that to me again.

11:15.440 --> 11:17.442
I'm sorry,
Belem, I won't.

11:18.680 --> 11:20.011
Have you had
any sleep?

11:20.080 --> 11:22.731
Yeah, I'm okay,
just jet lagged.

11:22.800 --> 11:24.529
Gotta get ready
for work.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.921
Maybe you should
take a day off.

11:27.560 --> 11:29.244
Would if I could.

11:30.240 --> 11:31.844
Our victim,
Justin Murray,

11:31.960 --> 11:35.203
moved to Portland
from New York seven years ago.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.282
Arrested for vandalism.

11:37.360 --> 11:39.169
Other than that, he's clean.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.402
No gang affiliations,
no known enemies.

11:41.480 --> 11:43.448
So we believe the
witness, Mr. Fierros?

11:43.520 --> 11:44.760
We're dealing
with a Chupacabra?

11:44.840 --> 11:46.842
Do we know what
a Chupacabra is?

11:46.920 --> 11:48.365
No, we don't.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.200
Well, somebody does.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.851
According to this,
the word "Chupacabra"

11:58.920 --> 12:00.729
comes from the
Spanish chupar,

12:00.800 --> 12:04.691
meaning "to suck,"
and cabra, meaning "goat."

12:04.760 --> 12:06.524
Goat sucker.

12:06.600 --> 12:07.761
We've had worse.

12:07.840 --> 12:08.887
Its name comes
from the belief

12:08.960 --> 12:11.088
that this creature
attacks livestock

12:11.160 --> 12:12.889
and drinks its blood.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.240
So we're dealing
with a Wesen.

12:14.320 --> 12:16.243
Yeah, I hope so.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.084
I cannot believe
I just said that.

12:18.160 --> 12:21.403
Well, whatever it is, is one
meal going to be enough?

12:21.480 --> 12:23.847
A Chupacabra
is Spanish.

12:24.120 --> 12:26.327
And I bet you, Juliette
knows something about this.

12:26.400 --> 12:29.244
I'm gonna have her
meet us at the trailer.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.411
Did you have
an ultrasound?

12:31.520 --> 12:33.329
No, but I took a pregnancy
test three times.

12:33.440 --> 12:34.566
I'm not pregnant.

12:35.280 --> 12:36.850
Well, maybe you
should have an MRI then.

12:38.440 --> 12:39.771
I've been under
a lot of stress.

12:39.840 --> 12:41.490
I think I just need
something for the nausea.

12:41.560 --> 12:42.607
What about
the headaches?

12:42.680 --> 12:43.761
That too.

12:43.840 --> 12:46.081
Look, I don't think it's
anything life threatening.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.770
Oh. it's serious, but it's
not life threatening?

12:47.840 --> 12:49.410
I don't even think
it's that serious.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.124
Nick had headaches after what
we went through,

12:51.200 --> 12:52.804
it could just be one
of the side effects.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.405
Let's hope not.

12:54.480 --> 12:56.130
I'm gonna put together
a few things for you.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.282
I'll give you enough to hold
you over while we're gone,

12:58.360 --> 13:00.044
but if it gets worse,
you need to see a doctor.

13:00.120 --> 13:01.485
Yes, Mom.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.721
I still can't believe you guys are
finally going on your honey...

13:07.800 --> 13:08.926
Don't jinx it!

13:09.000 --> 13:10.365
Right. Sorry.

13:11.680 --> 13:13.011
Hey, babe.

13:13.080 --> 13:15.811
No, I'm at the Spice
Shop with Rosalee.

13:16.480 --> 13:18.323
No, there's not a problem,
they're still going.

13:18.440 --> 13:20.727
Don't jinx m

13:20.800 --> 13:23.406
Yeah, I'll meet
you there. Okay, bye.

13:23.880 --> 13:25.120
Okay, I gotta go.

13:25.240 --> 13:26.890
You put that sign up
as soon as I leave,

13:26.960 --> 13:28.564
and have a fantastic time.

13:28.640 --> 13:29.801
Oh, thank you.

13:29.880 --> 13:31.882
I'll see you in a couple of weeks.
Bye.

13:32.040 --> 13:33.201
Very tan.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.520
Bye.

13:34.600 --> 13:36.090
Bye, sweetie.

13:43.160 --> 13:44.650
Spice and Tea.
How can I help you?

13:44.760 --> 13:46.250
Rosalee Calvert?

13:46.320 --> 13:47.401
Yes?

13:47.480 --> 13:49.323
You made a mistake.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.481
Who is this?

13:50.600 --> 13:52.170
Your marriage is
an abomination.

13:52.240 --> 13:55.289
A cancer on the institution
of rightful Wesen marriage.

13:55.360 --> 13:56.691
Go to hell.

13:56.760 --> 14:00.685
At your back door,
it'll be your blood next.

14:21.080 --> 14:22.605
on, my God!

14:29.880 --> 14:32.486
Are you all right?
No, no.

14:32.600 --> 14:33.647
They're not
going to stop.

14:33.720 --> 14:36.007
Someone doesn't
want us to be together.

14:36.080 --> 14:37.650
They want me to
leave you or...

14:37.720 --> 14:39.449
Or what?

14:39.520 --> 14:41.522
He said it's gonna
be my blood next.

14:42.160 --> 14:44.162
They're going
to hurt us!

14:46.200 --> 14:48.043
I am gonna kill them.

14:51.720 --> 14:53.563
Yeah? Can I show
you something, sir?

14:54.720 --> 14:55.801
Sure.

14:58.720 --> 15:00.643
Cause of death in
each one of these cases

15:00.720 --> 15:02.643
is what I would
call Portland-esque,

15:02.720 --> 15:05.200
and by that I mean,
it's weird.

15:05.840 --> 15:07.763
We have an assortment
of exploding stomachs,

15:07.840 --> 15:09.763
throats ripped open,
bodies cut in half,

15:09.840 --> 15:11.205
limbs chewed off
and so forth.

15:11.280 --> 15:13.089
But they have one
thing in common,

15:13.160 --> 15:15.606
they were all handled
by Burkhardt and Griffin.

15:15.680 --> 15:16.761
In this one,

15:16.840 --> 15:19.081
suspect was stabbed
to death, case closed.

15:19.160 --> 15:21.845
In this one, suspect was
shot to death, case closed.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.684
In this one,
suspect was captured,

15:23.760 --> 15:26.604
and declared mentally unfit
to stand trial, case closed.

15:26.680 --> 15:27.761
And your point is?

15:27.840 --> 15:29.126
I wanna know how they're
solving these cases

15:29.240 --> 15:31.607
when the evidence
doesn't lead to the suspect.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.284
What are they
seeing that I'm not?

15:33.360 --> 15:36.523
That's what makes them good
detectives, they see things we can't.

15:36.640 --> 15:38.927
Excuse
me, I need to take this.

15:42.840 --> 15:44.001
Hello?

15:44.520 --> 15:46.409
Sean Renard.
Yeah.

15:46.480 --> 15:48.289
You recognize my voice?

15:50.600 --> 15:51.726
I do.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.010
We need to meet.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.449
I can%leave
the country right now.

15:56.520 --> 15:59.808
You don't have to.
I came to you.

15:59.880 --> 16:02.121
Tell me where to
meet you tonight.

16:02.200 --> 16:04.965
Southwest Morrison
and Park, at nine.

16:25.720 --> 16:27.085
You Okay?

16:27.160 --> 16:29.640
Just a bit of a fever,
I'll be fine.

16:30.440 --> 16:32.363
Must've got something
while we were in the DR.

16:32.440 --> 16:34.727
Go home. Get some
rest, I can cover.

16:34.800 --> 16:37.531
You got enough to do.
I'm sure it's nothing.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.682
Hey, Gabe.
Did we talk last night?

16:41.760 --> 16:44.331
After we got home?
No. Why?

16:44.440 --> 16:45.771
I don't know.

16:46.520 --> 16:49.171
I just can't seem to
remember what I did last night.

16:49.840 --> 16:53.401
Man, you really need to get some rest.
Did you ask Belem?

16:53.480 --> 16:54.845
No, it's nothing.

16:54.920 --> 16:56.604
If you want,
I can run some tests.

16:56.680 --> 16:58.489
So can I.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.210
I've just gotta get back into
this time zone, that's all.

17:00.280 --> 17:03.443
All right, but I still
think you should go home.

17:05.960 --> 17:09.009
My grandma used to blame
the Chupacabra for everything.

17:09.079 --> 17:13.005
Dead relatives, missing
pets, even lost keys.

17:13.079 --> 17:15.002
Then, according to
your grandmother,

17:15.079 --> 17:16.319
Chupacabra is
a pet-eating,

17:16.400 --> 17:18.561
key-stealing,
goat-sucking killer.

17:18.680 --> 17:22.207
It is especially dangerous
if you are out alone at night,

17:22.280 --> 17:26.490
or you get into a car with
a boy, or come home late.

17:26.560 --> 17:30.451
I learned that the last
two weren't exactly true.

17:30.520 --> 17:31.880
Well,
I might have something.

17:32.320 --> 17:34.766
A Waldreor.

17:35.760 --> 17:38.969
All right, it's Puerto Rico,
1975, it's in Spanish.

17:40.320 --> 17:41.401
"I followed the rumors

17:41.480 --> 17:44.723
"to a small town of
Moca in Puerto Rico

17:44.800 --> 17:49.522
"where the locals had dubbed
it El Vampiro de Moca.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.402
"Initially, I had suspected
it was Wesen.

17:52.480 --> 17:53.686
"I was only half right.

17:54.800 --> 18:00.011
"Whatever it had once been,
it was now horribly deformed,

18:00.960 --> 18:02.928
"and seen by all.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.764
"Whatever the disease was,

18:04.840 --> 18:08.890
"mange, rabies, malaria,
perhaps even leprosy,

18:08.960 --> 18:11.440
"completely
transfigured the Wesen

18:11.520 --> 18:13.602
"into what has been known
since the Middle Ages

18:13.680 --> 18:15.045
"as a Waldreor.

18:15.480 --> 18:18.529
"The Wesen was buried
beneath the disease."

18:20.160 --> 18:23.562
Waldreor are Wesen that
contracted some kind of disease?

18:23.640 --> 18:25.290
Yeah, seems like.

18:25.360 --> 18:26.521
That's it!

18:26.600 --> 18:27.886
That's the Chupacabra.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.604
That is exactly
what it looks like,

18:29.680 --> 18:30.920
according to my grandma.

18:31.120 --> 18:34.010
So the Waldreor is
the original Chupacabra.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.889
Mmm.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.405
Yeah, Monroe.

18:38.320 --> 18:39.810
Well, slow down. What's up?

18:40.840 --> 18:42.046
We're on our way.

18:42.200 --> 18:43.247
What happened?

18:43.320 --> 18:45.607
The Secundum Naturae
Ordinem Wesen are back.

18:45.680 --> 18:47.648
And Monroe
is not happy.

19:59.840 --> 20:01.001
Diego??

20:04.640 --> 20:05.801
Did you fall?

20:12.960 --> 20:14.121
Diego?

20:33.960 --> 20:36.691
I didn't touch it. I didn't
think you'd want me to.

20:36.760 --> 20:38.364
We're gonna need
it as evidence.

20:38.440 --> 20:40.442
When did you find it?
I didn't.

20:40.520 --> 20:42.204
Rosalee did.

20:42.280 --> 20:45.170
She, uh, got a call
here earlier today.

20:46.320 --> 20:48.641
I'm assuming the caller
didn't identify themselves.

20:48.720 --> 20:52.964
No. He just said if she didn't
leave me, it'd be her blood next.

20:53.040 --> 20:54.724
We can run the number,
but my guess is

20:54.840 --> 20:57.605
he made the call
from a burner.

20:57.680 --> 21:00.001
I find who did this,
they're dead.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.969
Just letting you know.

21:03.560 --> 21:06.803
We think it was somebody at your
wedding who told somebody else.

21:06.880 --> 21:07.961
What?

21:08.040 --> 21:10.361
Before she left, Trubel was
able to identify some people

21:10.440 --> 21:12.761
who we think might
be members of this group.

21:12.840 --> 21:14.444
I've been monitoring
two of them.

21:14.520 --> 21:15.520
Give me their names.

21:15.560 --> 21:17.005
Not yet.

21:17.080 --> 21:18.684
We don't know how many
people are involved.

21:18.760 --> 21:21.127
And we can't take a chance on blowing it.
We've got to get 'em all.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.441
They threatened
Rosalee directly!

21:23.520 --> 21:24.965
They could have
killed her!

21:25.040 --> 21:26.929
You just need to make it
through one more day,

21:27.040 --> 21:28.963
then you get to go on your trip.

21:29.040 --> 21:31.646
It's Wu. I'm gonna
put him on speaker.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.291
Wu, what do you got?

21:35.360 --> 21:36.805
There was another attack.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.484
Happened in the parking
garage of St. Jo's.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.005
- Same MO.
- Any witnesses?

21:40.080 --> 21:42.242
Yeah, but she's not
making much sense.

21:42.360 --> 21:44.200
Good news
is the victim survived.

21:44.280 --> 21:45.964
They took him right into the hospital.
He's stable.

21:46.040 --> 21:47.121
What about the attacker?

21:47.240 --> 21:48.241
Got away.

21:48.320 --> 21:49.446
Did you get
a description?

21:49.640 --> 21:51.483
Oh, boy did we
get a description.

21:51.560 --> 21:54.211
Some kind of
wild dog in clothes.

21:57.640 --> 21:59.369
Canvass the area,
we're on our way.

21:59.440 --> 22:03.240
Maybe we should call in a dog
catcher with a really big net.

22:04.440 --> 22:05.930
Look, I have
to get to this case.

22:06.040 --> 22:08.281
But I promise you I will
find whoever did this.

22:09.280 --> 22:10.281
Monroe and Rosalee...

22:10.360 --> 22:11.885
Need to go
to our house.

22:11.960 --> 22:13.325
That's what I've
been telling her.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.562
Call me when
you get there.

23:18.200 --> 23:19.281
No!

23:32.720 --> 23:34.165
Who's screaming?

23:34.240 --> 23:36.083
Hey, man, what's going on?

23:36.160 --> 23:37.571
El Chupacabra!

23:37.640 --> 23:38.721
MAN 21 What?

23:39.720 --> 23:41.643
Hey, call the cops.

23:49.720 --> 23:53.202
Long shaggy hair,
glowing red eyes,

23:53.280 --> 23:55.328
and blood dripping
down its dog-like face.

23:56.440 --> 23:58.040
Seriously, this is
who we're looking for?

23:58.480 --> 24:00.687
Attacker was on foot,
he can't be far.

24:00.760 --> 24:02.000
Ah, maybe he had
a getaway car.

24:02.080 --> 24:03.525
Yeah, maybe.

24:03.680 --> 24:05.762
I'm gonna
find this guy.

24:06.360 --> 24:08.647
Uh, seems like you're taking
this kind of personally.

24:11.160 --> 24:14.960
Drew, when's the last time
that you had a real vacation?

24:15.040 --> 24:16.644
I'm just asking.

24:20.440 --> 24:22.408
What the hell was that?

24:22.520 --> 24:24.329
Hey! What
are you doing?

24:24.440 --> 24:25.566
Call for backup!

24:44.640 --> 24:46.483
Hands on the ground,
don't move!

24:49.600 --> 24:50.931
I said hands on the ground!

25:02.600 --> 25:05.922
What are you doing here?
Were you attacked?

25:08.920 --> 25:10.251
I don't know.

25:12.400 --> 25:13.890
Did you see where it went?

25:17.680 --> 25:19.011
Stay here.

25:29.560 --> 25:31.642
I drove all the way around,
I didn't see anything.

25:32.760 --> 25:35.081
Did you see
where he went?

25:44.840 --> 25:48.925
I was walking to my car and I thought
I saw my friend, Diego Hoyos.

25:50.080 --> 25:53.004
He was on the ground,
I thought he'd fallen.

25:54.480 --> 25:56.482
But when I got to him...

25:58.960 --> 26:00.041
What?

26:01.680 --> 26:03.170
I'm not sure.

26:03.560 --> 26:06.006
Anything you
remember can help us.

26:06.800 --> 26:09.007
It wasn't Diego.

26:09.080 --> 26:11.924
This was something else.

26:13.120 --> 26:14.884
He was wearing
Diego's clothes,

26:14.960 --> 26:18.806
he was going towards Diego's
car, but this was...

26:21.320 --> 26:23.049
I can't explain it.

26:23.480 --> 26:25.926
When was the last time
you saw Doctor Hoyos?

26:26.000 --> 26:27.525
Today. In his office.

26:27.600 --> 26:28.761
How was he?

26:30.080 --> 26:32.890
He said he was fine,
but I think he might be sick.

26:32.960 --> 26:35.281
We just got back
from the Dominican Republic.

26:35.360 --> 26:36.600
We need to find
this doctor.

26:36.680 --> 26:38.444
It wasn't him.

26:38.520 --> 26:40.170
I know it wasn't.

26:41.680 --> 26:43.569
Thank you
for your time.

27:25.280 --> 27:26.566
Tavitian.

27:36.480 --> 27:37.766
You've come
a long way.

27:38.760 --> 27:41.001
There's a rumor
the resistance has a child.

27:41.080 --> 27:42.923
A very important child.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.490
Yes, I heard
something about that.

27:44.600 --> 27:46.329
Did you hear that
we supposedly

27:46.400 --> 27:48.562
took the child right out
of Prince Viktor's hands,

27:48.640 --> 27:49.926
here in Portland?

27:51.880 --> 27:53.962
I gave the child
to Viktor.

27:54.480 --> 27:56.084
I had no choice.

27:57.480 --> 27:58.845
You may have given
the child to Viktor,

27:58.920 --> 28:00.040
but you know
as well as I do,

28:00.080 --> 28:03.209
you had no intention of
letting him leave with her.

28:03.600 --> 28:04.681
Where is she?

28:04.760 --> 28:06.967
She's with the
Grimm that you hired.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.770
So you know about Kelly Burkhardt?
Hmm.

28:08.840 --> 28:10.126
Why didn't you tell us?

28:11.520 --> 28:14.364
Because the resistance
has been betrayed.

28:14.440 --> 28:16.488
Adalind and the baby
barely escaped Europe.

28:16.560 --> 28:17.600
You have a
mole, my friend.

28:17.640 --> 28:19.847
I suggest you
find out who that is.

28:19.920 --> 28:21.445
How do I know
it wasn't you?

28:22.400 --> 28:24.050
Because if it
had been me,

28:24.120 --> 28:26.009
the child would be with the
Royal Family right now.

28:26.080 --> 28:27.650
And so would I.

28:30.960 --> 28:33.486
We're going to
find that child.

28:33.560 --> 28:34.891
And you're
going to help us.

28:42.640 --> 28:43.846
Look familiar?

28:43.920 --> 28:45.046
Yeah.

28:45.160 --> 28:47.128
The guy and his dog were
killed right up the street.

28:47.200 --> 28:49.806
So, Doctor Hoyos is either
the guy we're looking for,

28:49.880 --> 28:52.565
or he was attacked by the
Chupacabra in the parking garage.

28:52.640 --> 28:53.641
We didn't
find his body.

28:53.760 --> 28:54.761
Yet.

28:54.840 --> 28:56.126
But if he is
the Chupacabra,

28:56.200 --> 28:58.567
what kind of condition is he in now?

29:05.400 --> 29:08.165
I've been trying to call
him, but he hasn't answered.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.368
When was the last
time you spoke with him?

29:10.440 --> 29:12.204
This morning,
before he went to work.

29:12.280 --> 29:14.009
Can you please tell
me what this is about?

29:16.160 --> 29:18.481
Your husband's partner,
Doctor Reyes,

29:18.560 --> 29:20.210
he was attacked
earlier this evening.

29:21.040 --> 29:22.883
Oh, my God,
is Gabe okay?

29:22.960 --> 29:24.803
He's recovering
in the hospital.

29:24.880 --> 29:28.123
We believe your husband might
have seen what happened.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.361
He was there?

29:29.440 --> 29:31.200
We think your husband
may have been involved.

29:31.760 --> 29:34.764
No, no.
I don't believe it.

29:40.520 --> 29:42.204
Hey, it's all right.

29:43.800 --> 29:46.610
I'm not gonna hurt
you or your husband.

29:46.720 --> 29:49.530
But I need to know,
is your husband also Wesen?

29:50.360 --> 29:52.010
Coyotl, like me.

29:52.400 --> 29:55.006
You're the Grimm.
I've been told about you.

29:55.080 --> 29:56.889
Diego wouldn't
hurt anybody.

30:13.760 --> 30:16.286
Have you noticed
any change in his behavior?

30:16.720 --> 30:19.200
He just came back
from a long trip.

30:19.280 --> 30:21.328
He was very tired,
he works hard.

30:21.400 --> 30:23.164
Was your husband
home all last night?

30:23.240 --> 30:24.651
I'm not sure.

30:24.760 --> 30:26.524
When I woke up,
he was just coming in.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.921
He went for a walk.
He couldn't sleep.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.126
Do you know one
of your neighbors

30:30.200 --> 30:31.850
was attacked
earlier this morning?

30:32.960 --> 30:36.328
Yes, Justin Murray.
It's awful.

30:36.400 --> 30:39.131
Your husband
could be very sick.

30:39.200 --> 30:41.362
We need to talk to
him as soon as possible.

30:41.880 --> 30:43.530
Call me as soon
as he gets home.

30:50.240 --> 30:51.287
Wu.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.081
Hey, what are
you doing here?

30:53.160 --> 30:55.208
I need you to answer
a few questions for me.

30:55.280 --> 30:57.248
I've been thinking
about it a lot,

30:57.320 --> 31:00.085
and this job requires someone
of stable mind and body.

31:00.160 --> 31:02.925
And to be honest, stable is far
from what I'm feeling right now.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.206
Wu, you're good
at what you do...

31:04.280 --> 31:05.361
No, I'm not.

31:05.440 --> 31:07.329
I don't know
what's real anymore.

31:07.400 --> 31:08.526
I don't know
what the answer is

31:08.600 --> 31:10.887
but I'm seeing things
that I can't explain.

31:10.960 --> 31:12.849
All I know is I'm
gonna leave the best job

31:12.920 --> 31:14.440
I've ever had,
and you're gonna let me.

31:14.480 --> 31:15.520
Wu, this is
not the time...

31:15.600 --> 31:17.728
No, Hank, it never is!

31:17.800 --> 31:19.564
I think you both
know what's going on.

31:19.640 --> 31:22.211
And for some reason,
you're leaving me in the dark.

31:22.280 --> 31:25.523
I just hope it's a really good reason.
So, I'm done.

31:28.640 --> 31:30.244
That's enough.
I'm telling him.

31:30.320 --> 31:31.765
We both are.

31:31.840 --> 31:33.171
Wu, wait!

31:33.600 --> 31:34.601
WU, stop!

31:34.680 --> 31:35.761
For what?

31:38.400 --> 31:39.765
Tell us what you saw.

31:39.840 --> 31:42.730
Why don't you start by telling
me about Theresa Rubel,

31:42.800 --> 31:45.167
and those books she
had in your house.

31:51.480 --> 31:52.686
Diego?

31:55.800 --> 31:57.006
Diego?

31:57.960 --> 32:00.531
Diego! Oh, my God.

32:00.680 --> 32:01.761
Help me!

32:01.840 --> 32:02.921
What's wrong?

32:03.000 --> 32:05.002
I don't know what
is happening to me.

32:05.080 --> 32:07.401
Oh, you're sick.
You're very sick.

32:07.480 --> 32:10.404
I might've done
something awful.

32:10.480 --> 32:13.529
No. I'm calling
an ambulance.

32:23.240 --> 32:24.880
Theresa killed
them in self-defense.

32:26.200 --> 32:27.884
They attacked her.

32:27.960 --> 32:30.008
So, why are you
judge and jury on this?

32:30.080 --> 32:32.048
Why wasn't she arrested?
Why wasn't she put in jail?

32:32.120 --> 32:33.963
We did arrest her,
we did put her in jail.

32:34.040 --> 32:35.849
Then who let her out?

32:36.440 --> 32:37.646
I did.

32:40.400 --> 32:41.640
I wanna talk to her.

32:42.200 --> 32:43.361
She's gone.

33:13.080 --> 33:15.082
Wu, get her out of here!

33:15.480 --> 33:16.561
Wu!

33:26.440 --> 33:29.171
What's happening to him?
That's not my husband!

33:29.240 --> 33:31.891
Wait. You saw it?
You saw it, too?

33:31.960 --> 33:34.088
It's not him!
It's not him!

33:35.880 --> 33:37.291
No! No, Wu!

33:38.600 --> 33:41.001
We gotta kill it!
We gotta kill it!

33:43.600 --> 33:45.090
What's happening?

33:45.160 --> 33:47.481
Listen, he's Wesen.
And he's sick.

33:48.680 --> 33:50.569
And what you saw is real. What?

33:51.280 --> 33:52.441
Diego!

33:53.320 --> 33:54.481
He's sick!

33:54.560 --> 33:55.721
He's infected.

33:55.800 --> 33:58.531
And I think we know someone
who can help him.

34:03.880 --> 34:05.882
Wu took off.
I'm going after him.

34:07.560 --> 34:08.721
Hey, Monroe.

34:08.800 --> 34:11.121
You ever seen
a Waldreor before?

34:11.280 --> 34:12.520
No, why?

34:13.280 --> 34:16.090
Does this have to do
with that dog thing Wu saw?

34:16.159 --> 34:17.571
Yeah. And I'm
with it right now.

34:17.639 --> 34:19.641
I'm gonna need your help. Can
I meet you at the Spice Shop?

34:19.719 --> 34:20.801
Leaving now.

34:23.600 --> 34:24.647
Wu!

34:32.679 --> 34:34.045
What's wrong?

34:34.120 --> 34:35.690
Sounds like they
got some bad company.

34:35.800 --> 34:37.928
We gotta meet them
at the Spice Shop.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.239
Okay.

34:39.320 --> 34:40.321
Ooh.

34:42.480 --> 34:43.969
Are you okay?

34:44.320 --> 34:45.889
Yeah, I'm fine.

34:46.920 --> 34:49.685
Juliette, you need to
take care of yourself.

34:49.760 --> 34:51.489
Rosalee!
It's okay.

34:51.560 --> 34:54.404
We've got this.
You stay here.

34:59.560 --> 35:01.050
If it
really is Waldreor,

35:01.160 --> 35:02.960
then he's suffering
from a rare blood disease.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.446
We have to use this recipe
called Ka-dinga pepo.

35:05.520 --> 35:06.646
Excuse me?

35:06.720 --> 35:09.007
It's Swahili.
It means devil's disease.

35:09.080 --> 35:10.969
It's related
to dengue fever.

35:11.040 --> 35:12.405
Is it contagious?

35:12.480 --> 35:14.801
Only to Wesen,
through fluid exchange.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.120
What?

35:16.200 --> 35:17.440
And they're
bringing it here?

35:17.520 --> 35:19.887
Yeah, we just gotta be careful.

35:20.520 --> 35:22.045
Do you know
how to treat this?

35:23.240 --> 35:24.287
Oh, we have to hurry.

35:24.360 --> 35:26.124
If he's had the disease
for more than 48 hours,

35:26.200 --> 35:27.725
he could permanently
become a Waldreor.

35:27.800 --> 35:29.484
Permanently?

35:29.560 --> 35:30.891
As in forever?

35:30.960 --> 35:33.440
Well, they don't
live that long. Sorry.

35:34.280 --> 35:37.727
Okay, we need dried papaya
leaf, ground tawa-tawa herb

35:37.800 --> 35:40.121
with the vials in the top drawer
right there... I know, I know.

35:40.240 --> 35:42.163
India pennywort.
Got that.

35:43.480 --> 35:45.403
Oh, shoot,
we're almost out.

35:46.240 --> 35:47.969
How bad
is almost out?

35:48.080 --> 35:50.162
I only have
enough for one dose.

35:50.240 --> 35:52.049
Well, one is
all we need.

35:52.120 --> 35:53.360
"Grind the
ingredients together,

35:53.440 --> 35:55.090
"with liquefied
cows' knees."

35:55.160 --> 35:56.286
Cows' knees?

35:56.360 --> 35:59.603
Radix Cyathulae seu
Achyranthis, Chinese herb.

35:59.680 --> 36:02.809
We need to inject
the mixture into his spine.

36:02.880 --> 36:05.087
Hank, could you get a syringe
out of that top drawer?

36:05.480 --> 36:06.720
Got it.

36:07.440 --> 36:09.522
Where are the needles?
Back of the drawer.

36:09.600 --> 36:10.886
We're gonna have
to heat this up.

36:10.920 --> 36:12.920
Where's the burner? Right
here, behind the counter.

36:14.120 --> 36:15.451
Got it.

36:17.400 --> 36:19.084
Oh, no. She's fainted.

36:19.960 --> 36:21.485
No, stay back.

36:24.200 --> 36:25.929
She's convulsing.

36:30.600 --> 36:32.045
Wait! Stop!
Oh, Nick!

36:38.640 --> 36:41.007
What, I thought he
was the Chupacabra.

36:42.120 --> 36:43.884
Don't anybody move.

36:43.960 --> 36:45.803
That doesn't
sound like a strategy.

36:54.480 --> 36:55.891
Syringe!

36:55.960 --> 36:57.121
Put your cuffs on her!

36:57.280 --> 36:58.566
My cuffs are on him!

36:58.640 --> 37:00.324
Hold her.
I'm coming, I'm coming.

37:01.960 --> 37:03.689
Monroe, be careful!

37:03.760 --> 37:05.171
I'm trying!

37:06.480 --> 37:07.720
Roll her over!

37:11.920 --> 37:13.763
We only have one dose,
which one do we give it to?

37:13.840 --> 37:15.126
Rosalee!

37:15.760 --> 37:16.761
I gotta take him!

37:16.880 --> 37:17.881
No, don't shoot!

37:32.840 --> 37:34.001
Belem.

37:40.960 --> 37:42.371
I love you.

37:47.840 --> 37:49.205
Back away.

37:53.360 --> 37:54.600
Kill me.

37:55.840 --> 37:57.126
We can help you.

38:01.400 --> 38:02.526
No.

38:03.760 --> 38:05.250
It's too late.

38:13.080 --> 38:14.127
No!

38:32.440 --> 38:33.680
Diego.

39:50.840 --> 39:51.841
So first thing,

39:51.920 --> 39:53.888
we're gonna to try to get a lead
on who made the call to Rosalee.

39:53.960 --> 39:56.566
We're gonna get this thing
wrapped up before you get back.

39:56.640 --> 39:58.483
I hope to God
it's nobody we know.

39:58.560 --> 40:01.131
Well, it's gonna be somebody
who knows somebody we know.

40:01.200 --> 40:03.885
Whatever happens,
whatever we find out,

40:03.960 --> 40:05.371
we are not calling
you while you're gone.

40:05.440 --> 40:06.646
The officer
will stay outside

40:06.720 --> 40:07.801
until you leave
in the morning.

40:07.880 --> 40:10.929
Any calls that come in on any of
your phones will be recorded.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.809
Oh, thank you both.

40:12.880 --> 40:15.087
Have a good time.
Thanks, man.

40:16.640 --> 40:17.971
Have a Mai Tai for me.

40:18.040 --> 40:20.042
More than one,
my friend.

40:26.520 --> 40:28.249
We are going on
this honeymoon,

40:28.360 --> 40:31.045
and we are going to
have an amazing time.

40:31.120 --> 40:34.090
And we are not going to let
other people screw this up.

40:44.840 --> 40:46.490
Keep an eye out.

40:48.600 --> 40:50.364
NOW, let's find Wu.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.481
So that's it, right?
You called the cab company?

40:56.560 --> 40:59.166
Yep. They'll be here in the morning.
Eight sharp.

40:59.240 --> 41:00.651
Not that there's anything
sharp about eight,

41:00.720 --> 41:03.121
it's actually the roundest
number, except for zero.

41:06.720 --> 41:08.882
Stop looking out the window.
Let's go to bed.

41:08.960 --> 41:11.122
Officer Acker's gonna be
out there all night, you know?

41:11.200 --> 41:12.929
I feel like we
should do something.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.162
Okay,
I'll make him a snack.

41:27.160 --> 41:29.640
Sorry, Sarge.
I got no choice.

41:45.320 --> 41:47.049
Hi, there. Excuse me.

41:47.920 --> 41:49.922
My wife made you
a little something to eat.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.445
What the...
