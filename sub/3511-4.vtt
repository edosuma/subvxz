00:06.139 --> 00:07.173
Isn't this exciting?

00:07.419 --> 00:08.334
It's just a weekend, mother.

00:08.748 --> 00:10.477
Dad, it's your first romantic
weekend away with Beckett.

00:10.692 --> 00:11.283
It's a big deal.

00:11.521 --> 00:13.964
Okay, well, no pressure, and
let's just hope it happens.

00:14.255 --> 00:17.288
4:30 now. If she doesn't
catch a murder by 5:00,

00:17.599 --> 00:18.315
we are in the clear.

00:18.583 --> 00:19.930
So what do you have planned?

00:20.315 --> 00:22.018
- I...what do you mean?
- You don't have a plan?

00:22.431 --> 00:24.149
- The plan is to do nothing, to relax.
- Richard...

00:24.324 --> 00:24.797
That's not a plan.

00:25.001 --> 00:26.103
Women don't like it when
men don't have a plan.

00:26.366 --> 00:27.889
Hey, I'm in college now.
I'm living in the world.

00:28.033 --> 00:29.130
Plus, I read a lot of magazines.

00:29.259 --> 00:30.380
Not planning is really bad.

00:30.803 --> 00:31.571
- Okay... 
- She's right.

00:32.103 --> 00:33.971
A man says, "So what are
we gonna do for dinner?"

00:34.401 --> 00:35.215
Pfft. He's dead to me.

00:35.530 --> 00:36.967
Okay.
I will make reservations.

00:37.402 --> 00:38.127
Somewhere romantic.

00:38.331 --> 00:39.089
- Right.
- And classy,

00:39.265 --> 00:40.990
because Kate Beckett is a
classy kind of gal, you know?

00:41.113 --> 00:41.482
Right.

00:41.673 --> 00:42.674
Under the stars would be nice.

00:42.948 --> 00:44.479
Oh, and you know what else
you can do under the stars...

00:44.692 --> 00:46.653
Okay. La la la la la la la...

01:02.752 --> 01:04.049
T-minus one minute and counting.

01:04.974 --> 01:06.182
Castle, what are you doing here?

01:07.118 --> 01:08.125
You were supposed to
wait around the corner

01:08.424 --> 01:09.192
so that nobody'd see us.

01:09.404 --> 01:10.537
I know, but I thought
it would be fun

01:10.741 --> 01:12.414
to be here with you when
the clock strikes 5:00.

01:12.914 --> 01:13.981
You know, just like
New Year's Eve,

01:14.265 --> 01:16.627
except without the kissing
for obvious reasons.

01:16.771 --> 01:18.283
But there will be plenty
of that this weekend.

01:18.446 --> 01:19.566
Can you just shush?

01:19.818 --> 01:21.029
No one is going to hear me.

01:21.207 --> 01:21.694
Look around you.

01:22.691 --> 01:24.096
You are in a room
full of detectives...

01:24.269 --> 01:25.853
And not one of them has a clue.

01:26.670 --> 01:27.531
Wow, Castle.

01:27.653 --> 01:29.040
Thank you for reminding
me that I'm lying

01:29.221 --> 01:30.629
to a bunch of people
that I really care about

01:30.692 --> 01:32.535
so I don't get fired
on an ethics violation

01:32.614 --> 01:33.202
'cause I'm dating you.

01:34.141 --> 01:35.872
Well, you can put all that
out of your mind in three...

01:36.503 --> 01:37.599
two... one.

01:39.210 --> 01:39.704
No murder.

01:40.864 --> 01:42.260
There. Wasn't that fun?

01:43.624 --> 01:46.478
Okay, fine. I will go.
And no will even know I was...

01:46.557 --> 01:46.943
Hey, Castle.

01:47.570 --> 01:48.186
What you doing here, bro?

01:48.939 --> 01:51.126
I was just on my way
to the Hamptons

01:51.281 --> 01:52.384
to write for the weekend,

01:52.732 --> 01:54.258
and...and I thought I'd drop by,
see if we caught a murder.

01:54.799 --> 01:56.749
Wow. Anything to
avoid writing, huh?

01:57.128 --> 01:58.913
- Exactly.
- Hey, did you hear about Beckett's weekend?

01:59.428 --> 02:00.193
No. Big plans?

02:00.803 --> 02:02.191
She's going away
with her boyfriend.

02:02.848 --> 02:03.623
A boyfriend?

02:04.139 --> 02:05.425
Beckett! Really?

02:06.208 --> 02:07.157
Who is the lucky guy?

02:07.620 --> 02:08.562
For some reason,
she's not telling.

02:09.113 --> 02:10.112
Okay, seriously, guys?

02:10.695 --> 02:12.223
Actually, I for one am offended

02:12.426 --> 02:13.272
that you're not sharing with us.

02:13.520 --> 02:14.547
- Mm-hmm.
- After all we've been through.

02:14.773 --> 02:15.488
Yeah, I think we deserve better.

02:15.641 --> 02:16.548
You know, I have a
couple of ideas

02:16.728 --> 02:17.795
about what you guys deserve.

02:18.120 --> 02:20.045
Come on, Beckett.
Just give us something.

02:20.589 --> 02:21.288
Is he handsome?

02:21.773 --> 02:22.712
Yeah, i-is he handsome?

02:23.310 --> 02:24.773
Or is he more of a badass?

02:25.872 --> 02:28.247
Yeah, is that it, Beckett?
Is he, like, a bad boy?

02:29.001 --> 02:31.541
James Dean, huh?
Is he a desperado?

02:37.828 --> 02:38.430
I'm gonna...

02:43.846 --> 02:44.473
Let me holla at you.

02:46.681 --> 02:47.897
Why would Beckett be
holding out on us?

02:50.005 --> 02:50.932
Maybe there's something
wrong with the guy.

02:51.931 --> 02:52.487
Maybe he's bad news.

02:54.530 --> 02:55.367
Well, then as her partners,

02:55.990 --> 02:57.609
it's our obligation to
find out who this guy is.

02:58.063 --> 03:00.229
And what kind of partners
would we be if we didn't?

03:00.441 --> 03:01.563
Her safety could be at stake.

03:01.799 --> 03:04.437
Exactly, and with no active
murder case going on,

03:04.621 --> 03:06.222
I say we use this
time to find him.

03:38.674 --> 03:39.142
And here we are.

03:39.816 --> 03:41.035
Oh, my goodness, Castle.

03:42.324 --> 03:42.827
Wow.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.555
So, um...
are you rich or something?

03:50.013 --> 03:51.330
Well, I'm not James
Patterson rich,

03:51.495 --> 03:52.222
but I do okay.

03:53.773 --> 03:54.951
- Come on. I'll show you around.
- Yeah.

04:05.972 --> 04:07.471
After I finished
remodeling the kitchen,

04:07.772 --> 04:09.892
I swore I was done, but
then my designer called.

04:10.069 --> 04:11.331
She said I had to tie
in the living room,

04:11.630 --> 04:12.546
so I did that, too.

04:13.331 --> 04:15.794
That led to the second floor,
and then the basement.

04:15.877 --> 04:18.853
I had to stop taking her calls
or I'd have another wing.

04:27.449 --> 04:27.817
You coming?

04:29.653 --> 04:30.028
Yeah.

04:34.512 --> 04:37.389
This is actually
my favorite part.

04:38.372 --> 04:40.862
The sound of the ocean,
complete privacy...

04:41.349 --> 04:42.574
oh, the serenity.

04:43.251 --> 04:44.501
The pool is right down here.

04:44.837 --> 04:46.375
Most people find it magical.

04:50.592 --> 04:51.104
Everything okay?

04:53.013 --> 04:54.483
Yeah. It's, um...

04:57.095 --> 04:58.250
it's spectacular, Castle.

05:00.656 --> 05:01.896
And is that a problem?

05:04.518 --> 05:06.068
It's just, I can't
help wondering

05:06.257 --> 05:09.343
how many...
other girls have gotten this tour.

05:12.152 --> 05:12.648
Right.

05:17.066 --> 05:17.795
Well, I'm not gonna deny

05:18.837 --> 05:19.970
that I've brought
other women up here.

05:22.787 --> 05:23.494
But, um...

05:28.306 --> 05:28.967
None of them were you.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.278
You want to, um, go and
check out that pool?

05:41.521 --> 05:41.933
Yeah?

05:55.643 --> 05:57.678
I'm sure you will find the
temperature suitable...

05:57.777 --> 05:59.735
- Mm-hmm.
- But if you would like it any warmer,

06:00.004 --> 06:02.866
I can change the temperature
or I could just...

06:03.843 --> 06:04.710
stop talking.

06:08.579 --> 06:09.230
You forgot your suit.

06:10.306 --> 06:10.718
I know.

06:12.928 --> 06:13.324
Oh!

06:14.462 --> 06:14.881
What?

06:15.359 --> 06:16.036
Somebody's coming.

06:16.532 --> 06:16.890
What?

06:18.552 --> 06:18.975
Oh.

06:21.407 --> 06:21.790
Call 9-1-1.

06:22.839 --> 06:23.314
Ya think?

06:28.282 --> 06:33.282

06:38.282 --> 06:39.848
Yeah, he came stumbling
up from the beach,

06:40.111 --> 06:41.172
uh, just after 10:15.

06:41.967 --> 06:44.207
Uh, collapsed into the pool.
I tried to revive him, but...

06:44.537 --> 06:45.828
Were you here as well, ma'am?

06:46.282 --> 06:46.572
Yeah.

06:46.957 --> 06:47.503
Name, please.

06:49.063 --> 06:50.676
Um, Katherine Beckett,

06:50.964 --> 06:52.876
but do you think we could keep
that out of the public record?

06:54.347 --> 06:54.687
Of course.

06:56.664 --> 06:57.901
Not that we're doing anything wrong.
I j...

06:58.095 --> 06:58.473
Right.

07:00.038 --> 07:00.676
What's that supposed to mean?

07:01.578 --> 07:03.267
Don't worry. It's the Hamptons.

07:03.462 --> 07:04.116
We'll be discreet.

07:04.184 --> 07:05.830
We're...we're not interested
in your arrangement.

07:06.220 --> 07:07.617
- Arrangement?
- Chief, Chief,

07:07.879 --> 07:10.057
uh, I'm...I'm not... I
don't...she's not a...

07:10.277 --> 07:11.639
I'm not a prostitute.

07:12.017 --> 07:13.195
Oh, I'm sure.

07:14.168 --> 07:15.579
So is there anything
you'd like to add

07:15.756 --> 07:17.127
to Mr. Castle's statement,
madam...ma'am?

07:17.768 --> 07:18.153
Yes.

07:19.254 --> 07:20.701
Only that we didn't
hear any gunshots,

07:20.878 --> 07:23.467
so that probably means that
the killer used a silencer.

07:25.734 --> 07:26.816
Watch a lot of cop shows, do we?

07:27.287 --> 07:28.940
Uh, do we know who
the victim is yet?

07:29.909 --> 07:31.432
Uh, Randall Franklin.

07:32.298 --> 07:34.069
He's a weekender, out
here from Manhattan.

07:34.245 --> 07:36.536
All we know is that he was
at a party up the beach

07:36.700 --> 07:38.369
at Douglas Shapiro's house
earlier this evening.

07:39.644 --> 07:40.177
Hey, Chief!

07:40.923 --> 07:41.412
We got him.

07:42.300 --> 07:42.848
Excuse me.

07:48.287 --> 07:49.897
We got him.
Name's Casius McMurray.

07:50.430 --> 07:51.101
Local meth user.

07:51.619 --> 07:52.721
Found him asleep
in the tall grass

07:52.824 --> 07:53.904
couple hundred yards to the east

07:54.294 --> 07:55.109
with the victim's wallet.

07:55.617 --> 07:57.380
Guy's out of it, high as a kite.

07:57.779 --> 07:58.522
That's unbelievable.

07:59.424 --> 07:59.885
What's that?

08:00.538 --> 08:04.019
Meth. These rich kids, they're
into everything these days.

08:04.359 --> 08:06.337
Drug arrests have doubled
in the last six months.

08:07.893 --> 08:08.668
Okay. Well...

08:09.365 --> 08:09.868
thanks for your help.

08:09.912 --> 08:11.726
Uh, what about blood spatter?

08:11.947 --> 08:14.082
Did you find any on the
beach or on the suspect?

08:14.687 --> 08:16.812
No. But w-why would I even look?

08:16.886 --> 08:17.521
I mean, we got the guy.

08:18.095 --> 08:19.086
Yeah, I-I'm sure we will.

08:20.852 --> 08:21.694
He had the victim's wallet.

08:22.304 --> 08:22.684
Right.

08:24.456 --> 08:26.459
Y-you know, he could've found
that wallet on the beach.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.496
Are you questioning my judgment,
Mr. Castle?

08:31.059 --> 08:31.510
I...

08:32.457 --> 08:33.477
- Think we got the guy.
- Right.

08:34.187 --> 08:34.948
- Good night.
- Good night.

08:36.616 --> 08:38.376
All right.
Come on. Let's go.

08:39.606 --> 08:40.010
Move.

08:45.207 --> 08:46.471
What kind of cold-blooded killer

08:46.745 --> 08:48.871
takes a nap on the beach
after shooting someone?

08:49.914 --> 08:51.671
Castle, I'm on vacation.

08:52.310 --> 08:53.775
If I wanted to
investigate a murder,

08:54.023 --> 08:54.899
I would've stayed in the city.

08:56.587 --> 08:57.811
The guy died in my backyard.

08:58.502 --> 08:59.392
It's not our case.

09:00.521 --> 09:02.465
Still, you have to admit, as
cases go, it's pretty weak.

09:02.840 --> 09:05.435
It's still not our case, and if
you keep obsessing over this,

09:05.650 --> 09:06.548
it's gonna ruin the weekend.

09:13.098 --> 09:13.737
So what do we do?

09:18.287 --> 09:20.617
Maybe we just try putting
it out of our minds, hmm?

09:21.085 --> 09:21.901
Yeah, but what about the gun?

09:22.180 --> 09:23.174
They would've found
the gun on him.

09:23.503 --> 09:24.993
Castle, that's not putting
it out of your mind.

09:25.207 --> 09:27.133
- You're right. I'm sorry. I'm obsessing.
- Yeah.

09:27.297 --> 09:28.208
- I won't obsess.
- Okay.

09:29.214 --> 09:31.492
Except you said it yourself
about not hearing the shots.

09:31.651 --> 09:32.672
What kind of meth head

09:32.816 --> 09:34.230
who obviously doesn't
know what planet he's on

09:34.323 --> 09:36.661
carries a gun with a silencer?

09:36.800 --> 09:38.941
Which, by the way,
indicates premeditation.

09:40.943 --> 09:42.086
We're not gonna get
on with our weekend

09:42.185 --> 09:43.562
until you've gotten
some answers, are we?

09:43.847 --> 09:44.525
I'll get the coffee.

09:50.616 --> 09:51.622
All right, thank you, Dougie.

09:52.093 --> 09:53.021
And I'm sorry I
missed the party.

09:53.183 --> 09:53.757
I heard it was killer.

09:54.890 --> 09:56.327
Yeah, sorry. Gotcha.

09:57.287 --> 10:00.670
Okay, last time Shapiro
saw Franklin alive

10:01.380 --> 10:02.888
was at his party at 8:15.

10:04.015 --> 10:05.261
That's two hours
before he was killed.

10:05.618 --> 10:06.672
Right. He was on the beach

10:07.179 --> 10:09.178
having an argument with a
woman in a white dress,

10:09.594 --> 10:10.645
but because it was already dark,

10:11.465 --> 10:12.518
Shapiro couldn't
tell who it was.

10:12.798 --> 10:13.853
He knew it wasn't
Franklin's wife,

10:13.976 --> 10:15.079
because she was still
back in the city.

10:15.777 --> 10:16.519
Any luck finding a reason

10:16.685 --> 10:17.680
why someone would
want Franklin dead?

10:17.937 --> 10:20.941
As a matter of fact, he was a
banker at Lehman Brothers...

10:21.089 --> 10:23.433
and he was involved in an
insider trading scandal

10:23.630 --> 10:24.404
before they went belly up.

10:24.915 --> 10:26.422
He cut a deal for his
freedom by testifying

10:26.660 --> 10:27.347
against his colleagues.

10:28.329 --> 10:29.928
Rachel Rosenberg, Jeff Forshim,

10:30.165 --> 10:32.906
Emily Monroe, Angela
Colabro, and Aaron Lerner.

10:33.387 --> 10:35.370
Well, they all did time,
but now that they're out,

10:36.115 --> 10:37.120
any one of 'em could
have wanted revenge.

10:37.536 --> 10:38.947
And three of them could've
been our mystery woman.

10:39.941 --> 10:41.122
We need to talk to
Franklin's wife,

10:41.626 --> 10:42.670
find out if he had any enemies.

10:42.826 --> 10:43.262
No.

10:43.802 --> 10:45.756
We just got here.
I am not going back to the city.

10:46.159 --> 10:48.218
Well, fortunately,
we don't have to.

10:49.434 --> 10:50.382
I know just who to call.

10:51.378 --> 10:52.029
Beckett's boyfriend?

10:52.286 --> 10:53.731
Don't you two have
something better to do?

10:54.065 --> 10:54.823
Actually, no.

10:55.087 --> 10:56.254
We figure Beckett must have
started up with the guy

10:56.458 --> 10:57.185
during her suspension.

10:57.604 --> 10:58.686
Pretty emotional time for her.

10:58.894 --> 11:00.110
I bet she needed a
shoulder to lean on.

11:00.286 --> 11:00.709
An ex.

11:00.998 --> 11:02.097
It would explain why
she's too embarrassed

11:02.170 --> 11:02.881
to tell us who it is.

11:03.146 --> 11:03.780
It makes her look weak.

11:03.991 --> 11:05.761
We're thinking the
most likely scenario

11:05.944 --> 11:07.747
is that it was the last
guy that she was with.

11:08.193 --> 11:10.160
- Dr. Joshua Davidson.
- Mm-hmm.

11:10.389 --> 11:11.104
It's him, isn't it?

11:12.254 --> 11:14.519
Okay, I get that you
don't have a life, Javi,

11:14.745 --> 11:16.602
but you're married, Kevin,
so what's your excuse?

11:16.957 --> 11:18.592
- I...
- Whoever Beckett's boyfriend is

11:18.661 --> 11:19.707
is none of your business.

11:20.111 --> 11:22.532
Come on, Lanie.
You must know who it is.

11:23.459 --> 11:24.717
She went back to
Josh, didn't she?

11:25.241 --> 11:26.618
Is this how you
interrogate people?

11:26.986 --> 11:29.070
'Cause you ain't doing
nothing but pissing me off.

11:30.495 --> 11:33.637
Now I don't know who it is, and
I respect Beckett's privacy,

11:33.843 --> 11:35.905
but I do know it's not Josh

11:36.069 --> 11:38.283
because he's been in the
Amazon setting up free clinics

11:38.381 --> 11:39.108
for the last year.

11:41.056 --> 11:42.059
Are you sure about that?

11:46.026 --> 11:47.047
- I think she's sure.
- Yeah.

11:51.992 --> 11:52.504
Hey, Castle.

11:53.102 --> 11:54.092
Yeah, I'm gonna put
you on speakerphone

11:54.272 --> 11:55.051
so you can weigh in on this.

11:55.778 --> 11:56.329
Weigh in on what?

11:57.043 --> 11:58.121
Well, we're in the
morgue with Lanie

11:58.300 --> 11:59.693
trying to figure out who
Beckett's boyfriend is.

12:01.025 --> 12:02.439
I have nothing

12:02.882 --> 12:03.830
to do with this nonsense.

12:05.206 --> 12:05.942
Yeah, until you're

12:06.081 --> 12:08.255
bagging their mangled bodies
when Beckett finds out.

12:09.128 --> 12:10.017
Pfft.
Like we're afraid of Beckett.

12:10.449 --> 12:11.319
Besides, how's she
gonna find out?

12:12.539 --> 12:14.739
Anyway, I need your guys' help.

12:15.135 --> 12:18.066
There has been a homicide
out here in the Hamptons

12:18.148 --> 12:18.962
in my backyard.

12:19.711 --> 12:20.291
Seriously, Castle?

12:21.058 --> 12:22.689
What, are you in...in an episode
of "Murder, She Wrote"?

12:23.309 --> 12:25.827
More like "Murder, He Wrote,"
but unfortunately,

12:26.183 --> 12:26.951
unlike Jessica Fletcher,

12:27.111 --> 12:28.640
the local police chief...
not a friend of mine,

12:28.917 --> 12:30.300
and I think he may have
the wrong guy, so...

12:31.214 --> 12:33.712
I need you guys to question the
victim's wife in the city,

12:33.907 --> 12:34.564
find out what she knows.

12:34.828 --> 12:37.200
- Mm.
- That's a pretty big favor to ask, Castle.

12:38.212 --> 12:39.121
We're gonna need
something in return.

12:42.462 --> 12:43.584
- The Ferrari.
- For a week.

12:43.600 --> 12:44.054
Each.

12:44.066 --> 12:45.000
Seriously? Guys.

12:45.934 --> 12:46.939
- Mm.
- Guys.

12:48.333 --> 12:49.000
I don't understand.

12:49.859 --> 12:51.145
They already caught
the guy, didn't they?

12:51.780 --> 12:53.867
I'm told he was some
kind of drug addict.

12:54.734 --> 12:56.863
Well, with all due respect
to the Hamptons PD,

12:57.198 --> 12:58.582
we would like to make
absolutely sure.

12:59.327 --> 12:59.881
We know your husband

13:00.492 --> 13:02.353
testified against several
colleagues at Lehman.

13:03.060 --> 13:04.176
Has he been in contact
with any of 'em?

13:05.111 --> 13:05.808
Why are you asking?

13:07.492 --> 13:08.842
Maybe one of them came
after him for revenge.

13:09.765 --> 13:10.149
No.

13:10.607 --> 13:12.770
He left banking after the
crash and never looked back.

13:14.036 --> 13:15.263
Got into commercial real estate.

13:15.930 --> 13:17.459
That's how we managed
to stay afloat.

13:18.632 --> 13:19.243
Mrs. Franklin,

13:19.529 --> 13:22.029
your husband was seen arguing
with a woman on a beach

13:22.261 --> 13:23.668
a couple of hours
before he was killed.

13:24.400 --> 13:25.665
Do you have any idea who
it could have been?

13:26.771 --> 13:27.201
No.

13:28.447 --> 13:29.282
But if I were to guess,

13:30.296 --> 13:31.294
I'd say it was his girlfriend.

13:32.507 --> 13:33.004
Girlfriend?

13:33.983 --> 13:35.250
He was having an affair?

13:35.722 --> 13:37.441
With a Natalia Roosevelt.

13:37.773 --> 13:38.422
She's a local.

13:39.024 --> 13:41.443
The wife got wind of it, sent
him up here to break it off.

13:41.767 --> 13:44.418
It's probably your typical
tawdry Hamptons story.

13:44.887 --> 13:46.944
Weekender meets local beauty,

13:47.502 --> 13:50.364
the elixir to his
stressful city life.

13:50.812 --> 13:52.456
Whirlwind romance ensues...

13:53.236 --> 13:53.887
but then the wife
gets wind of it,

13:53.937 --> 13:54.771
forces him to end it,

13:55.135 --> 13:57.446
and that's when the elixir
becomes a poison...

13:58.280 --> 13:59.397
with a gun, only...

14:00.159 --> 14:01.222
I'm gonna have to work
on that last part.

14:01.537 --> 14:03.461
No, it's a great story,
but how do we prove

14:03.797 --> 14:05.786
that it was her that he was
arguing with on the beach?

14:06.249 --> 14:08.087
Well, the first step
is to determine

14:08.197 --> 14:09.200
whether she was at the party.

14:09.661 --> 14:10.246
I'll check the e-vite.

14:11.635 --> 14:13.608
And there she is...
Natalia Roosevelt...

14:13.830 --> 14:14.523
in the "yes" column.

14:14.750 --> 14:17.471
And, ooh, looking every
bit the femme fatale.

14:17.830 --> 14:19.840
Castle, she was a Hamptons
town councilwoman

14:19.988 --> 14:21.936
and the owner of the
Hamptons Sand Bar.

14:22.405 --> 14:24.430
That is a popular
local watering hole.

14:25.811 --> 14:26.441
Can I buy you a drink?

14:32.335 --> 14:32.873
There she is.

14:33.876 --> 14:35.726
Our lady in the white dress.

14:36.765 --> 14:38.617
Only now she's looking
dazzling in blood red.

14:39.019 --> 14:39.722
So what's our play?

14:40.226 --> 14:41.141
Just keep it light, Castle.

14:41.340 --> 14:42.962
Find a natural way of
bringing up the murder.

14:43.387 --> 14:44.093
See how she reacts.

14:45.062 --> 14:45.859
I know just what to do.

14:47.631 --> 14:48.883
Hey, I recognize you.

14:49.505 --> 14:51.068
You were at Douglas
Shapiro's party last night.

14:51.398 --> 14:52.424
Ah, who wasn't?

14:52.882 --> 14:55.552
Right?
But I saw you on the beach.

14:55.761 --> 14:57.310
Weren't you arguing
with Randall Franklin?

14:58.428 --> 14:59.970
Light, Castle. I said light.

15:00.403 --> 15:01.614
What are you implying?

15:01.615 --> 15:04.082
Nothing, no.
Only it must be weird for you.

15:04.083 --> 15:06.226
You had to be the last
person to see him alive.

15:06.747 --> 15:08.028
Hey, uh, Chief.

15:08.621 --> 15:09.722
Yeah, Natalia.

15:10.144 --> 15:11.814
- Come here.
- Oops.

15:11.828 --> 15:13.773
- Yeah.
- Do you know these guys?

15:13.823 --> 15:16.264
Because they are practically
accusing me of murder.

15:16.502 --> 15:18.037
Castle, what are you doing here?

15:18.318 --> 15:19.865
Uh, just having a conversation.

15:19.866 --> 15:21.596
About Franklin's murder?

15:21.665 --> 15:24.184
Hey, you got a problem
with the way I do my job?

15:24.198 --> 15:25.225
Uh... now I would never

15:26.028 --> 15:27.674
use those words exactly.

15:27.675 --> 15:29.549
Oh, well, how about these words?

15:29.550 --> 15:32.940
You and your hooker
friend are under arrest

15:32.941 --> 15:35.131
for interfering with my
murder investigation.

15:35.132 --> 15:36.023
Turn around.

15:37.569 --> 15:38.249
Ah.

15:38.554 --> 15:39.668
Thanks for the drink.

15:39.669 --> 15:40.530
Cheers.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.685
I cannot believe I
let you talk me into

15:51.686 --> 15:54.529
getting involved in another
department's murder investigation.

15:54.530 --> 15:56.729
Oh, like I needed
to twist your arm.

15:56.894 --> 15:58.831
And at least we know we
were right about this guy.

15:59.253 --> 16:01.299
I mean, does he look like he has
a guilty conscience to you?

16:01.300 --> 16:03.325
He's sleeping like
a little baby.

16:03.492 --> 16:05.294
More like a baby chainsaw.

16:05.295 --> 16:07.982
Castle, Beckett, Chief
Brady wants to see you.

16:13.789 --> 16:14.552
Chief.

16:14.991 --> 16:16.788
Hey, thanks, Jones.

16:16.868 --> 16:17.833
Hi, guys.

16:18.154 --> 16:19.822
You want some coffee?
It's fresh.

16:19.912 --> 16:20.940
Yeah, thanks.

16:21.761 --> 16:24.118
So I googled you, Ms. Beckett.

16:24.420 --> 16:27.433
I didn't realize you were
a homicide detective.

16:28.247 --> 16:30.848
I've never actually
worked a homicide before.

16:31.098 --> 16:33.536
Other than drug arrests,
I deal mostly with folks

16:33.537 --> 16:35.854
complaining about their neighbor's
dog pooping in their garden.

16:36.579 --> 16:38.039
I've never even pulled my gun.

16:39.284 --> 16:40.079
I'm sorry.

16:40.217 --> 16:41.812
Uh, why are you telling us this?

16:41.813 --> 16:43.784
Because you were right
about the meth addict.

16:43.785 --> 16:46.083
The lab results came back
negative for gunshot residue,

16:46.084 --> 16:49.378
which means that the
killer is still at large.

16:50.059 --> 16:53.192
Look... I'm getting a lot
of pressure from the mayor.

16:53.664 --> 16:56.729
Rich weekender getting murdered,
not exactly good for business.

16:56.730 --> 16:58.678
Still not getting why
you're telling us this.

16:59.822 --> 17:00.702
Okay.

17:01.723 --> 17:04.086
I will drop the
interference charge

17:04.087 --> 17:05.777
if you help out with
the investigation.

17:05.778 --> 17:06.942
Sounds good to me.

17:06.997 --> 17:08.117
Y...excuse me for a second.

17:09.935 --> 17:10.787
Sounds good?

17:10.958 --> 17:14.011
We just spent two hours of
our vacation in lockup.

17:14.012 --> 17:15.174
Isn't that enough?

17:15.906 --> 17:17.002
Well, do you really think

17:17.002 --> 17:21.261
we'll be able to relax without
getting any answers?

17:21.483 --> 17:24.492
Without... getting justice?

17:27.175 --> 17:27.963
Fine.

17:32.413 --> 17:35.148
As long as word doesn't get back to
my precinct that I'm doing this.

17:35.149 --> 17:36.198
Works for me.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.208
So what do we do next?

17:38.649 --> 17:39.880
Did you get ballistics back?

17:39.881 --> 17:41.389
Oh, yes. Uh...

17:42.523 --> 17:43.275
Let's see.

17:43.276 --> 17:46.001
Bullets pulled from the
victim were 30 caliber.

17:46.002 --> 17:47.788
30 caliber.
Those are pretty rare, aren't they?

17:47.789 --> 17:49.329
Yeah, that's usually used
for hunting small game.

17:49.330 --> 17:51.638
Can I see the ME's
report on Franklin's body?

17:51.957 --> 17:53.461
It has not come in yet.

17:54.002 --> 17:57.179
Then I suggest you pressure
the ME to get it back.

17:57.180 --> 17:58.385
In the meantime,

17:58.386 --> 18:00.889
we should interrogate
Natalia Roosevelt.

18:00.890 --> 18:02.725
Oh, I already spoke to her.

18:03.074 --> 18:04.826
She has no motive for
killing Franklin.

18:05.996 --> 18:08.421
And did you ask her about
being his mistress?

18:10.054 --> 18:10.895
No.

18:11.763 --> 18:13.188
She didn't mention that.

18:13.189 --> 18:14.204
Yeah.

18:14.380 --> 18:17.823
Suspects tend to hold
back on stuff like that.

18:18.678 --> 18:19.469
Mmm.

18:20.948 --> 18:22.100
Flavor country.

18:23.534 --> 18:25.952
I thought you arrested
these guys, John.

18:25.953 --> 18:26.850
Um, that's...

18:26.851 --> 18:29.220
That's Chief Brady to you,
Ms. Roosevelt,

18:29.221 --> 18:31.061
and shouldn't you be more
concerned about the fact that

18:31.062 --> 18:34.272
you lied to him about your
affair with Randall Franklin?

18:36.315 --> 18:37.869
I didn't lie to him.

18:38.753 --> 18:41.629
Chief Brady never
asked me about it.

18:41.725 --> 18:43.970
Didn't Randall break up with
you on the beach last night?

18:45.172 --> 18:46.286
So what if he did?

18:46.287 --> 18:48.793
So that gives you motive,
Ms. Roosevelt.

18:48.813 --> 18:51.015
Look... I am not denying

18:51.016 --> 18:53.319
that I was fighting
with Randall.

18:53.518 --> 18:55.025
I accused him of...

18:55.276 --> 18:57.230
using me to get my council vote.

18:57.231 --> 18:58.411
Your vote on what?

18:58.412 --> 19:00.128
His beloved helipad.

19:00.170 --> 19:02.575
He put the thing in his
backyard six months ago.

19:02.576 --> 19:04.016
But he needed a variance.

19:04.017 --> 19:05.037
We approved it last week.

19:05.038 --> 19:07.061
Next thing you
know, he dumps me.

19:07.062 --> 19:09.102
Then he was shot and
killed two hours later.

19:09.402 --> 19:12.358
Two hours later, I
was back at my bar.

19:12.858 --> 19:15.347
Look, the last time I saw
him was on that beach.

19:15.348 --> 19:17.115
We were still arguing
when he got a text

19:17.116 --> 19:18.337
and he suddenly ran off.

19:18.338 --> 19:19.859
And what time was that?

19:19.860 --> 19:21.160
About 8:30.

19:23.098 --> 19:24.275
Which way did he go?

19:24.756 --> 19:26.056
Up the beach.

19:32.787 --> 19:33.672
Okay, then.

19:35.240 --> 19:36.047
Hey.

19:36.221 --> 19:38.392
So I tracked down that
text that Franklin got

19:38.393 --> 19:40.261
before leaving Ms. Roosevelt
on the beach.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.437
Couldn't get the content,

19:41.438 --> 19:43.100
but it was sent from
a burner phone.

19:43.101 --> 19:45.199
Whoever sent it wished
to remain anonymous.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.781
Maybe it was about
bad business deals.

19:46.782 --> 19:48.463
That's what got him in trouble
with his colleagues in the past.

19:48.464 --> 19:50.445
The past does have a funny
way of repeating itself.

19:50.446 --> 19:51.820
Speaking of which,

19:51.821 --> 19:53.976
I have calls into my
sources at Robbery

19:53.977 --> 19:56.293
to try to link Beckett
to her old beau...

19:56.325 --> 19:57.498
Detective Demming.

19:57.826 --> 19:59.505
Demming? Come on.

19:59.740 --> 20:01.545
Beckett could do so much better.

20:02.538 --> 20:04.629
Uh, thank you for the update.
I gotta go.

20:05.052 --> 20:07.049
Why are you even helping them?

20:07.050 --> 20:08.239
Well, come on. The good news is,

20:08.240 --> 20:09.759
they're completely
fooled about us.

20:09.760 --> 20:11.508
Yeah, well, I don't understand
why they even care.

20:11.525 --> 20:13.534
Ah, why do people care
about Brangelina?

20:13.899 --> 20:15.281
Oh, so we're Brangelina now?

20:15.282 --> 20:17.717
No. No, no. We're... Rickate.

20:18.827 --> 20:20.978
No, we're... Kate-ick.

20:21.022 --> 20:21.827
Mm.

20:22.989 --> 20:23.874
Cas-kett?

20:23.875 --> 20:25.430
Ooh, that's good 'cause of the whole
murder thing...casket.

20:25.461 --> 20:25.953
Mm-hmm.

20:25.994 --> 20:28.563
So Natalia Roosevelt
has a solid alibi.

20:28.564 --> 20:30.451
Three patrons of her bar
confirmed she was there

20:30.452 --> 20:31.782
by 9:00 last night.

20:31.783 --> 20:33.559
Long before Franklin was shot.

20:33.990 --> 20:35.512
I got Deputy Jones
canvassing the houses

20:35.513 --> 20:38.403
along the beach in the direction
she said Franklin went.

20:38.919 --> 20:40.333
Just Deputy Jones?

20:40.740 --> 20:42.387
It's the Hamptons.

20:42.682 --> 20:44.378
We don't have a
lot of resources.

20:44.379 --> 20:46.718
Oh, by the way.
I know you wanted to see this.

20:46.719 --> 20:48.028
It's the ME report.

20:49.597 --> 20:53.956
Uh, F-Franklin's lungs
were full of saltwater.

20:54.572 --> 20:56.831
Meaning he almost drowned.
That's strange.

20:56.893 --> 20:59.189
And based on the condition
of the gunshot wounds,

20:59.190 --> 21:01.752
he was in the ocean at least
20 minutes after being shot.

21:01.753 --> 21:02.940
Okay, so...

21:03.577 --> 21:04.927
in the ocean for 20 minutes,

21:04.928 --> 21:06.565
no one heard the shots being...

21:07.412 --> 21:09.224
That's why no one
heard the shots.

21:10.280 --> 21:12.726
He was shot off a boat,
"Godfather" style.

21:12.727 --> 21:14.206
And the saltwater slowed
down his bleeding,

21:14.207 --> 21:16.557
giving him enough time
to make it to shore.

21:17.378 --> 21:19.438
So what, we should
try and figure out

21:19.439 --> 21:21.532
which boats were in the
vicinity at that time?

21:21.595 --> 21:22.956
Yeah. So...

21:23.120 --> 21:26.361
do we have a witness who we know
was on the beach last night?

21:26.362 --> 21:28.894
You mean someone like...

21:29.204 --> 21:30.797
our favorite meth addict...

21:30.798 --> 21:31.769
McMurray?!

21:33.463 --> 21:34.569
Seriously?

21:35.477 --> 21:36.964
The guy was whacked out on meth.

21:36.965 --> 21:39.317
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that
he doesn't remember what he saw.

21:39.593 --> 21:41.494
Yeah, I saw a boat...

21:41.633 --> 21:43.937
about 100 yards off the beach.

21:44.095 --> 21:45.535
Okay, great.
Can you describe it?

21:45.536 --> 21:46.662
Maybe it's size.

21:46.663 --> 21:50.410
Nah. All I remember is,
it was being attacked.

21:50.411 --> 21:51.525
Attacked?

21:51.739 --> 21:53.702
Yeah, by a shark.

21:53.873 --> 21:56.299
A red shark with red eyes.

21:59.025 --> 22:01.023
Okay, maybe you are
right about him.

22:01.489 --> 22:02.691
Maybe not.

22:04.579 --> 22:06.172
Yeah, I know that boat.
It's just this way.

22:06.173 --> 22:07.369
Owned by Aaron Lerner.

22:07.637 --> 22:08.757
Aaron Lerner.

22:08.779 --> 22:10.742
That's one of the guys
Franklin sent to prison.

22:10.943 --> 22:13.126
Do you know if that boat
went out last night?

22:13.136 --> 22:15.294
Yeah, I saw it pull
away around 9:30.

22:15.295 --> 22:18.073
That's an hour after Franklin left
Natalia Roosevelt on the beach.

22:18.074 --> 22:20.347
That's plenty of time
for him to get here.

22:20.429 --> 22:22.049
If the boat left here by 9:30,

22:22.050 --> 22:24.857
it could've easily made it to
the water off my house by 9:45.

22:24.858 --> 22:25.878
Red shark.

22:33.268 --> 22:34.290
Shark attack.

22:34.593 --> 22:36.129
- Oh, watch your step.
- Ohh!

22:36.672 --> 22:38.025
Damneded weekend boater.

22:39.372 --> 22:41.636
Castle... blood spatter.

22:42.398 --> 22:43.663
Franklin was shot right there.

22:44.129 --> 22:45.040
Hey, Lerner.

22:45.761 --> 22:46.724
Killer boat.

22:55.383 --> 22:56.804
It's the lab report

22:56.909 --> 22:59.412
on the blood splatter we found
on the deck, Mr. Lerner.

22:59.413 --> 23:01.081
It's a match to
Randall Franklin.

23:01.082 --> 23:03.921
Meaning he was
shot on your boat.

23:04.046 --> 23:06.541
No, that's not possible.
He wasn't even on it.

23:06.603 --> 23:07.774
How did it get there?

23:07.805 --> 23:08.913
I have no idea.

23:09.237 --> 23:10.519
We have a witness
who saw your boat

23:10.520 --> 23:12.377
leaving the marina
at 9:30 last night.

23:12.378 --> 23:13.410
Where did you go?

23:13.411 --> 23:14.752
I didn't take it out last night.

23:14.753 --> 23:16.105
Lerner, come on.

23:16.669 --> 23:18.629
We know Randall Franklin
was guilty of breaking

23:18.630 --> 23:21.345
all the same laws you broke,
but he got off scot-free

23:21.346 --> 23:23.329
because he ratted you out.

23:23.427 --> 23:25.778
It's understandable you'd
want a little payback.

23:25.779 --> 23:28.103
Wait. All right. Sure.
Yeah, I held a grudge.

23:28.104 --> 23:30.049
Who wouldn't?
But you know something?

23:30.050 --> 23:31.923
I met him on the beach
a few months ago,

23:31.924 --> 23:33.236
and we buried the hatchet.

23:33.237 --> 23:35.620
I've even had dinner at
his house a couple times.

23:35.673 --> 23:38.999
And exactly where were you
between 8:30 and 10:00 last night?

23:39.644 --> 23:40.385
Group.

23:42.968 --> 23:45.736
W...a weight-loss group at the rec.
What?

23:46.008 --> 23:48.875
Look, you want to catch the
guy who actually killed him,

23:48.969 --> 23:50.341
check out his neighbor.

23:50.914 --> 23:52.310
I'm sorry. His neighbor?

23:52.492 --> 23:54.874
Oh, yeah.
This guy's a scary bastard.

23:55.035 --> 23:57.036
I'm having dinner at
Franklin's a week ago, right?

23:57.037 --> 23:59.762
Neighbor comes over, starts
banging on the front door.

23:59.817 --> 24:01.894
Franklin wouldn't tell
me what it was about,

24:02.077 --> 24:04.733
but this guy was threatening him
with all kinds of violence.

24:05.182 --> 24:06.505
Okay, thanks.

24:07.718 --> 24:10.527
Well...
Lerner's alibi checks out.

24:10.528 --> 24:13.835
He was at the weight-loss group
from 8:30 to 10:00 last night.

24:13.849 --> 24:15.921
Meaning someone else
took out his boat,

24:16.114 --> 24:16.932
killed Franklin,

24:16.933 --> 24:19.455
and then brought it back
without Lerner... learning.

24:19.456 --> 24:21.281
I'll have Jones
canvass the marina.

24:21.330 --> 24:23.799
Meantime, do we know
who this neighbor is?

24:24.295 --> 24:26.133
Yeah.
It's just a property dispute.

24:26.134 --> 24:27.668
They're a dime a
dozen around here.

24:27.669 --> 24:29.086
Yeah, but the way that
Lerner describes it,

24:29.087 --> 24:30.686
it sounded like it was
something pretty heated.

24:30.687 --> 24:32.670
Well, the neighbor's
a bit of a hothead,

24:32.671 --> 24:33.798
but, um, I'm telling you,

24:33.799 --> 24:36.228
it is not a motive for murder.

24:36.683 --> 24:38.533
Shouldn't we at least
talk to this guy?

24:42.246 --> 24:45.356
Okay, look, it's
not just any guy.

24:46.753 --> 24:48.185
It's Vincent Cardano.

24:49.163 --> 24:51.873
Vinnie "The Scar" of the
Cardano crime family?

24:51.874 --> 24:54.601
That would explain the "Godfather"
style of the boat shooting.

24:55.724 --> 24:57.446
I'm friends with his cousin Sal.

24:57.447 --> 24:59.259
He's been trying to get
us together for years.

24:59.260 --> 25:00.622
And what better time
than the present?

25:00.623 --> 25:03.049
We could bring him over and ask
him what he did last night.

25:03.050 --> 25:04.620
Whoa. Okay. No.

25:05.304 --> 25:07.433
I am not going at
Cardano without proof.

25:09.771 --> 25:11.284
Look, I gotta run.

25:11.864 --> 25:13.984
I gotta go reroute traffic

25:13.985 --> 25:16.094
for the Bridgehamptons
Polo Semifinals.

25:16.228 --> 25:17.115
But remember...

25:17.116 --> 25:18.299
we'll finish this later.

25:18.732 --> 25:19.875
I call the shots.

25:20.460 --> 25:22.381
No contacting Vinnie The Scar.

25:22.875 --> 25:26.053
I'm glad we could finally
get together, Ricky. Salud.

25:26.054 --> 25:28.017
I'm sure that Sal told you
I'm a big fan of your work.

25:28.018 --> 25:29.138
- So to new friends.
- Yes.

25:29.170 --> 25:30.490
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

25:30.584 --> 25:33.118
Ah, sweetie.
This meat sauce is to die for.

25:33.245 --> 25:34.422
Thank you, Vinnie.

25:34.534 --> 25:37.054
Actually, it is excellent.
I didn't know you could cook.

25:37.601 --> 25:39.441
You should pay a little
more attention, Castle.

25:39.442 --> 25:42.402
Ooh, see, that's the difference
between Castle and me.

25:42.710 --> 25:44.231
You've had my complete attention

25:44.232 --> 25:45.793
since I've been
here, sweetheart.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.393
Whoa, whoa. Watch it, Vinnie.

25:47.394 --> 25:49.649
Don't make me have to do to you
what someone did your neighbor.

25:49.650 --> 25:51.168
Oh, you heard about that, huh?

25:51.169 --> 25:53.042
Heard about it?
The guy ended up in my pool.

25:53.043 --> 25:54.903
Yeah.
Well, you know, I gotta admit,

25:55.003 --> 25:57.243
I'm not gonna shed any
tears over that guy.

25:57.260 --> 25:58.497
Oh, so you knew him, huh?

25:58.498 --> 26:00.461
Ah, the guy was a real bastard.

26:00.462 --> 26:02.958
Uh, he builds a helicopter
pad in his yard

26:02.959 --> 26:04.535
not 50 feet from my house.

26:04.536 --> 26:05.996
Every Tuesday around midnight,

26:05.997 --> 26:07.842
he buzzes right past my bedroom.

26:07.843 --> 26:09.219
The balls on that guy.

26:09.220 --> 26:10.934
Yeah, so...so I complain,

26:10.935 --> 26:13.447
but the town council,
they approve it anyway.

26:13.632 --> 26:16.055
I know for a fact that
guy greased palms.

26:16.056 --> 26:18.544
Oh-ho, I wanted to kill him.

26:18.609 --> 26:19.525
I bet.

26:19.959 --> 26:21.854
So where were you when
you found out about it?

26:21.985 --> 26:23.514
I don't know. What's it matter?

26:24.119 --> 26:26.613
Well, it's just, a guy you
wanted killed ends up killed?

26:26.614 --> 26:27.683
How often does that happen?

26:30.452 --> 26:31.433
I don't know.

26:37.439 --> 26:38.949
What are you saying, Castle?

26:40.087 --> 26:40.925
Hmm?

26:44.632 --> 26:46.066
You think I killed the guy?

26:46.801 --> 26:49.507
Well, n-no. Vinnie, no.
We're just talking here.

26:49.508 --> 26:50.836
No, sit down.
Have some more wine.

26:50.837 --> 26:52.272
No, we're finished here.

26:52.719 --> 26:55.024
And frankly, I am
offended that you think

26:55.025 --> 26:57.091
I would do such a
bush-league hit.

26:58.141 --> 26:59.645
If I had whacked that guy,

27:00.274 --> 27:02.096
nobody'd ever find the body.

27:06.118 --> 27:08.224
Don't make me wanna
do a demonstration.

27:17.982 --> 27:19.228
He makes a valid point.

27:25.025 --> 27:27.440
Dead bodies, meth heads,
and mobsters.

27:27.441 --> 27:29.377
Is that what you mean
by a romantic weekend?

27:29.378 --> 27:30.797
May I remind you
that it was murder

27:30.798 --> 27:32.580
that brought us together
in the first place?

27:33.774 --> 27:34.482
Oh.

27:36.207 --> 27:37.008
Hello.

27:37.009 --> 27:38.160
What did I tell you, Castle?

27:38.161 --> 27:41.169
I was crystal clear.
I said no contacting Cardano!

27:41.170 --> 27:43.546
What? Oh, that was
just a friendly meal.

27:43.547 --> 27:45.177
Actually, we have
some linguine left

27:45.178 --> 27:46.075
if you'd like to come over.

27:46.076 --> 27:47.494
You accused him of murder!

27:47.495 --> 27:48.820
And now he thinks I
put you up to it.

27:48.821 --> 27:51.306
On the bright side, we can
rule him out as a suspect.

27:51.307 --> 27:53.521
He was never a suspect
in the first place.

27:53.522 --> 27:54.666
Bottom line is,

27:54.667 --> 27:55.962
the killer's still out there.

27:55.963 --> 27:58.492
No. No, no, no. The bottom line is
that after what you just pulled,

27:58.493 --> 27:59.973
I will find him myself,

27:59.974 --> 28:01.147
without any more of your help.

28:01.148 --> 28:01.897
Look, Chief...

28:01.898 --> 28:05.004
And if I catch you guys anywhere
near this case again, I swear...

28:05.507 --> 28:06.868
I will out the two of you.

28:10.557 --> 28:12.296
So I guess it's a
"No" on the linguine.

28:12.297 --> 28:14.656
No. He, uh...
said he already ate.

28:14.657 --> 28:15.699
- Shall we?
- Oh.

28:16.877 --> 28:18.732
Hey. So I took a closer look

28:18.733 --> 28:20.748
at Randall Franklin's
real estate investments.

28:20.749 --> 28:22.527
The guy was buying up
distressed properties

28:22.528 --> 28:25.015
in dying neighborhoods and
turning 'em into condos.

28:25.428 --> 28:26.750
Sounds like smart investments.

28:26.751 --> 28:28.442
Yeah, but he wasn't
renovating 'em.

28:28.468 --> 28:30.333
He wasn't leasing
'em out, nothing.

28:30.379 --> 28:31.720
So he was carrying the mortgage,

28:31.721 --> 28:33.687
but the buildings weren't
throwing off any income?

28:33.688 --> 28:35.099
And his wife said that

28:35.100 --> 28:36.903
the real estate investments
were keeping them flush.

28:36.904 --> 28:37.885
It doesn't add up.

28:37.886 --> 28:38.991
You're right.

28:39.006 --> 28:40.437
Has to be something going
on in those buildings.

28:40.438 --> 28:41.897
Only one way to find out.

28:51.251 --> 28:53.114
Ugh. Franklin definitely

28:53.115 --> 28:55.090
didn't put any money into
renovating this dump.

28:55.503 --> 28:56.879
Place is deserted.

28:57.417 --> 28:58.994
He's definitely not
making any money here.

28:59.072 --> 29:01.412
- Yeah, so where's it coming from?
- I don't know.

29:02.063 --> 29:02.921
Oh.

29:04.402 --> 29:05.205
Really?

29:05.636 --> 29:07.519
You're checking your
text messages right now?

29:07.755 --> 29:08.901
It's about Beckett, bro.

29:09.235 --> 29:11.293
Ah! She's not with Demming.

29:11.819 --> 29:14.654
Morales in Robbery says that he's
been dating a vice detective...

29:14.655 --> 29:15.969
- for the last four months.
- Shh.

29:17.755 --> 29:18.643
You hear that?

29:19.737 --> 29:20.477
Yeah.

29:25.190 --> 29:26.186
I don't like this, bro.

29:26.490 --> 29:27.457
No, me neither.

29:50.141 --> 29:51.628
No way we're knocking
on that door.

29:51.798 --> 29:54.558
Okay. Well, the
building owner's dead,

29:54.741 --> 29:57.047
and the wife is down with
us investigating, so...

29:57.406 --> 29:59.016
NYPD!

29:59.017 --> 30:00.677
Up against the wall right now!
Move!

30:00.678 --> 30:02.550
Move! Move! Move!

30:02.551 --> 30:05.052
Move it! Move it! Move it!

30:07.680 --> 30:08.606
Ah.

30:13.529 --> 30:14.598
Ah.

30:15.107 --> 30:16.004
Looks like Franklin found a way

30:16.005 --> 30:17.870
to monetize his
investment after all...

30:17.871 --> 30:18.976
making crank.

30:19.525 --> 30:22.486
Yeah.
This is definitely a meth lab.

30:25.513 --> 30:27.714
So Franklin was a
meth kingpin, huh?

30:27.715 --> 30:29.449
Turns out, all of his properties

30:29.450 --> 30:30.878
housed meth labs,

30:30.879 --> 30:33.705
which makes sense
for someone who...

30:33.706 --> 30:35.459
used to cook the books.

30:36.015 --> 30:37.235
That's why he was killed.

30:37.236 --> 30:38.292
It's a dangerous business.

30:38.293 --> 30:38.739
Mm.

30:39.312 --> 30:41.147
Well, it's all about
New York now.

30:41.156 --> 30:42.622
- The boys can take it from here...
- Yeah.

30:42.646 --> 30:45.071
And we can pick up right
where we left off

30:45.072 --> 30:47.423
before this whole
thing came to us.

30:48.313 --> 30:51.329
Yeah, but...
why did it come to us?

30:51.330 --> 30:55.263
Uh... the universe has a
sense of humor, I suppose.

30:55.264 --> 30:56.997
No, no, I mean, if
this is about meth,

30:56.998 --> 30:59.133
then why wasn't he
killed in New York?

30:59.134 --> 31:00.461
Maybe the killer
likes the beach.

31:00.462 --> 31:02.632
No, I think there's gotta
be more to it, Castle.

31:02.633 --> 31:04.727
I mean, they knew
about Lerner's boat.

31:04.728 --> 31:06.791
You know what?
I'm sure the boys will figure it out.

31:06.792 --> 31:09.200
And that requires an intimate
knowledge about Franklin's life.

31:09.201 --> 31:10.511
That's local knowledge.

31:10.512 --> 31:11.267
Right, right, right.

31:11.268 --> 31:13.258
Well, maybe the killer
just did his homework.

31:13.259 --> 31:15.041
Yeah, but why would they
go to all of that trouble?

31:15.042 --> 31:16.930
I mean, if he was a
kingpin in New York City,

31:16.931 --> 31:18.413
why would they
kill him out here?

31:18.414 --> 31:19.463
Um...

31:21.517 --> 31:23.735
unless part of the drug
business was out here.

31:23.736 --> 31:25.380
That explains the helicopter.

31:25.381 --> 31:27.618
He needed the helicopter to
transfer the drugs out here.

31:27.619 --> 31:29.913
And why he slept with
Natalia and greased palms.

31:29.914 --> 31:31.257
He needed approval
to get the helipad.

31:31.258 --> 31:34.528
Yes, much less risky to move
your product in a helicopter

31:34.529 --> 31:35.579
rather than boat or car.

31:35.580 --> 31:36.965
No cop is gonna pull you over.

31:36.966 --> 31:38.487
You know, Chief Brady said
that the drug problem

31:38.488 --> 31:39.813
has doubled over the
past six months.

31:39.814 --> 31:42.921
Exactly when Franklin started
using his helicopter.

31:43.899 --> 31:46.285
I'm sorry, Castle.
But I think you should probably...

31:46.286 --> 31:47.561
Call Ryan and Esposito.

31:47.562 --> 31:48.166
Yeah.

31:52.718 --> 31:54.168
Looks like Castle was right.

31:54.169 --> 31:56.234
His helicopter's
flight plans coincide

31:56.235 --> 31:58.620
with when the shipments
left the meth labs.

31:58.621 --> 31:59.326
Huh.

32:00.023 --> 32:01.929
They also coincide with
the late-night landings

32:01.930 --> 32:03.583
that his neighbor was
complaining about.

32:03.584 --> 32:05.483
So now we know how Franklin
was moving his product.

32:05.484 --> 32:06.818
But it still doesn't
tell us who killed him.

32:06.819 --> 32:09.226
Well, maybe it does, but
where are you going?

32:09.397 --> 32:10.768
To meet an FBI buddy of mine

32:10.769 --> 32:12.916
to see if Beckett's back
with her old flame Sorenson.

32:12.917 --> 32:13.505
Why?

32:13.506 --> 32:15.337
The flight manifest
for Tuesday...

32:15.338 --> 32:16.283
it includes a guest.

32:16.284 --> 32:18.051
Someone else was with him.

32:18.748 --> 32:21.660
All right, I'm on Sorenson.
You go get helicopter boy.

32:21.854 --> 32:23.690
So I got a ride on
Franklin's helicopter.

32:23.691 --> 32:24.606
So what?

32:24.607 --> 32:27.313
That doesn't prove my client was
trafficking drugs with him.

32:27.314 --> 32:29.359
True. These do.

32:29.360 --> 32:31.272
Signed affidavits from
the meth lab workers

32:31.273 --> 32:33.781
that you picked up product
every Tuesday, Lerner.

32:33.782 --> 32:35.634
You went from making
bank to making crank.

32:35.635 --> 32:37.331
I didn't kill Franklin.

32:37.332 --> 32:39.710
A-and Chief Brady already
confirmed my alibi

32:39.711 --> 32:40.421
in the Hamptons.

32:40.422 --> 32:41.819
Well, maybe you hired
someone to kill him.

32:41.820 --> 32:44.824
See, I think you never got over
your grudge against Franklin.

32:44.825 --> 32:46.964
I think that you
partnered with him,

32:46.965 --> 32:48.607
but you always planned
to knock him off

32:48.608 --> 32:50.830
and take over the business.
Am I getting close?

32:50.831 --> 32:53.216
Yeah, yeah, you're close, but
you just got the wrong guy.

32:53.217 --> 32:54.113
What do you mean?

32:54.114 --> 32:56.740
Just last week, Franklin was
complaining about a local.

32:56.741 --> 32:57.817
A local drug dealer?

32:57.818 --> 33:00.688
Yes. Seems he didn't appreciate
us moving in on his business.

33:00.689 --> 33:01.789
Who? Give me a name.

33:01.790 --> 33:02.778
I don't know a name,

33:02.779 --> 33:04.380
but Franklin seemed
really spooked.

33:04.381 --> 33:05.302
What else did he
tell you about him?

33:05.303 --> 33:06.486
That's all I know.

33:06.487 --> 33:08.957
Everything else I told to Brady
and his two consultants.

33:08.958 --> 33:10.345
Two consultants?

33:10.346 --> 33:13.126
Yeah, yeah, the writer
Castle and his girlfriend.

33:13.127 --> 33:16.845
Girlfriend?
Wh-wh-what do you mean, girlfriend?

33:17.144 --> 33:18.014
What does that matter?

33:18.015 --> 33:21.335
Hey! Hey!
I'll ask the questions here, pal.

33:21.545 --> 33:23.490
Are you telling me
that Richard Castle

33:23.491 --> 33:26.003
brought his girlfriend
in your interrogation?

33:28.072 --> 33:28.886
Yeah.

33:28.887 --> 33:30.576
What was her name?

33:30.577 --> 33:31.422
I don't remember.

33:31.423 --> 33:32.794
Well, then describe her.

33:32.795 --> 33:34.398
Describe her, Lerner! Now!

33:34.399 --> 33:36.952
Okay! Tall, uh, uh,
medium length hair.

33:36.953 --> 33:37.871
What's this about?

33:37.872 --> 33:39.485
What color?
G-give me a hair color.

33:39.486 --> 33:40.878
Uh, uh, brown.

33:40.879 --> 33:43.298
Brown. Brown eyes, too, I think.
Really pretty.

33:43.299 --> 33:44.156
Body type?

33:44.157 --> 33:45.981
Awesome. I mean, awesome.

33:45.982 --> 33:48.304
She was, like, thin,
gorge... she was hot.

33:48.305 --> 33:50.149
She was really hot.

33:50.491 --> 33:51.460
Kate!

33:51.461 --> 33:53.452
Name was Kate!

33:54.819 --> 33:56.113
Son of a...

34:01.836 --> 34:02.991
You were right, Castle.

34:02.992 --> 34:04.373
Franklin was using
his helicopter

34:04.374 --> 34:05.958
to move meth to the Hamptons.

34:05.959 --> 34:08.223
Looks like you blew
this case wide open.

34:08.224 --> 34:10.005
Guess you can get back to
your writing now, huh?

34:10.007 --> 34:10.960
Well, there's still the matter

34:10.960 --> 34:12.656
of finding out who
the killer is.

34:12.833 --> 34:15.322
Yeah, well, I think Brady
knows what he has to do.

34:15.324 --> 34:17.259
I already told him to look
for a local drug dealer

34:17.260 --> 34:18.362
who would've been
feeling squeezed

34:18.362 --> 34:20.202
by Franklin's
expanding operation.

34:20.635 --> 34:22.134
Well, that's a great theory.
Nice work.

34:22.135 --> 34:23.176
Oh, thanks, but, uh,

34:23.177 --> 34:24.638
it's not my theory.

34:24.801 --> 34:25.822
Aaron Lerner gave it up

34:25.824 --> 34:27.879
when I interrogated
him this morning.

34:29.110 --> 34:30.699
Aaron Lerner? Aar...uh...

34:30.701 --> 34:33.684
So you interrogated
Aaron Lerner, too?

34:33.685 --> 34:35.463
Yeah, he's back in the city.

34:35.464 --> 34:37.753
Turns out he was Franklin's
partner in crime.

34:37.754 --> 34:40.399
Wow. What do you know?

34:40.411 --> 34:41.554
Castle, not good.

34:41.556 --> 34:42.333
I know. Relax.

34:42.333 --> 34:43.348
Relax? How can I relax?

34:43.574 --> 34:44.465
You still there, Castle?

34:44.466 --> 34:46.521
Yeah. Still here.

34:46.522 --> 34:48.849
Uh, what else did
Aaron Lerner say?

34:48.850 --> 34:52.679
Did he say anything else about...
anything else?

34:52.679 --> 34:54.504
Oh, you know, the usual.

34:54.505 --> 34:55.482
"I didn't do it,

34:55.483 --> 34:57.056
you got the wrong guy."

34:57.530 --> 34:59.941
I'm pretty sure he told
me everything he knows.

35:00.143 --> 35:00.742
Everything?

35:00.743 --> 35:02.599
Everything, huh?

35:03.471 --> 35:04.525
That's good.

35:04.526 --> 35:05.791
Yeah.

35:06.112 --> 35:07.339
Good luck with the writing.

35:07.733 --> 35:08.643
Thanks.

35:18.059 --> 35:20.024
Chief Brady. What did I do now?

35:20.025 --> 35:20.963
Nothing.

35:20.964 --> 35:22.235
Uh, I just wanted
to let you know,

35:22.236 --> 35:24.018
I talked to Detective Ryan.

35:24.485 --> 35:26.699
Really? So... what did he say?

35:26.700 --> 35:29.400
Well, he got us on to the
idea of a local drug dealer.

35:29.401 --> 35:31.520
So we talked to McMurray... the
meth addict from the beach...

35:31.521 --> 35:34.845
and he coughed up the name of
the local supplier of meth.

35:35.303 --> 35:36.563
Marty Bentley.

35:36.564 --> 35:37.931
- Oh.
- The marina operator?

35:37.932 --> 35:39.106
Yeah, but that makes sense.

35:39.107 --> 35:40.562
I mean, he would know
Aaron Lerner's schedule

35:40.563 --> 35:41.650
and when he could
take the boat out.

35:41.651 --> 35:42.291
Right.

35:42.292 --> 35:44.167
So we got a warrant to
search his apartment

35:44.168 --> 35:46.480
and found the burner cell
phone that sent the text

35:46.481 --> 35:48.048
summoning Franklin
to the marina.

35:48.049 --> 35:48.822
Hmm. Good.

35:48.823 --> 35:49.981
Well, that's great. Congrats.

35:49.982 --> 35:52.274
Thanks. Hey, I couldn't have
done it without the two of you

35:52.275 --> 35:54.500
and your resources in New York.

35:54.710 --> 35:58.677
Um... I'd be honored if
you came to the arrest.

36:00.862 --> 36:01.622
No.

36:02.095 --> 36:04.840
Well, how can we say no?

36:08.218 --> 36:10.435
Police! Down! Get down!

36:10.436 --> 36:11.694
Police! Police!

36:11.695 --> 36:14.365
So Chief Brady's first
time pulling his gun.

36:14.366 --> 36:16.157
Oh, Castle.
Maybe I should go in there.

36:16.158 --> 36:17.126
You don't have a gun.

36:17.127 --> 36:18.306
Yeah, but that never stops you.

36:18.307 --> 36:20.203
Well, I'm lucky.

36:21.492 --> 36:22.609
We got him.

36:22.610 --> 36:23.227
Oh.

36:24.117 --> 36:25.743
Cabin secured.

36:25.744 --> 36:27.569
Nice one, Chief Brady.

36:27.570 --> 36:29.228
- Thank you, Detective.
- Yeah.

36:29.229 --> 36:31.203
Just like out of one of
your books, huh, Castle?

36:31.204 --> 36:35.147
Yeah. Uh, marina owner
with side meth business

36:35.148 --> 36:36.263
kills competition.

36:36.264 --> 36:39.112
Call it "Hamptons Heat,"
and if I ever write it,

36:39.113 --> 36:41.273
I'll be sure to include a
gutsy Chief Brady character.

36:41.274 --> 36:42.452
That's not mine.

36:42.655 --> 36:45.176
Look, I'm telling you,
I didn't do anything.

36:45.177 --> 36:46.380
You got the wrong guy.

36:46.381 --> 36:47.796
Chief, so far I found
baggies of meth

36:47.797 --> 36:49.784
and an automag III .30 carbine.

36:49.970 --> 36:51.158
Which shoots 30-caliber bullets

36:51.159 --> 36:52.957
just like the ones that we
pulled out of our victim.

36:52.958 --> 36:54.284
That's our murder weapon.

36:54.285 --> 36:56.403
Well, I guess that seals it.
Good...good work, Deputy.

36:56.404 --> 36:57.996
This is ridiculous.

36:57.997 --> 37:00.891
I didn't kill anybody.
You got the wrong guy.

37:00.892 --> 37:01.450
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This way.

37:01.451 --> 37:02.694
Watch your step.

37:04.381 --> 37:06.058
Officer, hold on a second there.

37:06.875 --> 37:08.241
What is it, Castle?

37:08.914 --> 37:09.593
This knot.

37:09.594 --> 37:11.312
Both of these knots.

37:12.265 --> 37:14.913
That's a perfect figure
eight with an underhand,

37:14.914 --> 37:16.486
neatly flemished.
Did you tie these, Bentley?

37:16.487 --> 37:18.187
Of course I did. It's my boat.

37:18.188 --> 37:19.766
What about it, Castle?

37:19.767 --> 37:21.192
Well, it's beautiful.

37:21.403 --> 37:23.054
I mean, it's perfect.

37:23.055 --> 37:25.238
That knot could be in a
book of nautical knots.

37:25.239 --> 37:26.857
What does that have
to do with anything?

37:26.858 --> 37:28.881
Everyone agrees that the
killer is the same person

37:28.882 --> 37:30.554
who stole Aaron Lerner's boat.

37:30.555 --> 37:32.654
That person had to tie
the boat to the dock,

37:32.655 --> 37:34.423
but that knot was sloppy.

37:34.424 --> 37:35.893
I even tripped over it.

37:35.894 --> 37:39.469
Whoever tied these figure eights
is an experienced boatman.

37:39.470 --> 37:41.185
Tying knots would be
their second nature.

37:41.186 --> 37:44.507
They'd be incapable of
tying a sloppy knot.

37:44.508 --> 37:45.767
Bentley can't be the killer.

37:45.768 --> 37:48.312
But we found the burner phone
that placed the call to Franklin

37:48.313 --> 37:49.838
in Bentley's apartment.

37:49.839 --> 37:50.955
How do you explain that?

37:50.956 --> 37:53.238
Well, that's easy.
It was planted.

37:53.698 --> 37:56.387
Just like Bentley's boat here
had the meth and the gun,

37:56.388 --> 37:58.319
which I'm sure forensics will show

37:58.320 --> 38:00.313
is the actual murder weapon.

38:01.988 --> 38:05.053
And just who do you
think planted it?

38:05.327 --> 38:07.323
Well, you tell me.

38:08.267 --> 38:10.741
Uh, Chief Brady, who got the
information from McMurray

38:10.742 --> 38:12.003
on Bentley?

38:12.004 --> 38:14.041
Jones. It was Deputy Jones.

38:15.792 --> 38:17.722
Okay, okay, get back!

38:17.723 --> 38:19.075
Everybody stay back!

38:19.076 --> 38:19.850
Take it easy, Jones.

38:19.851 --> 38:21.160
We don't want anybody
to get hurt.

38:21.161 --> 38:23.632
You rich weekenders, you
think you're so smart.

38:23.633 --> 38:25.202
Meantime, you... you
pollute our beaches,

38:25.203 --> 38:26.959
you throw your money around
like you're better than us.

38:26.960 --> 38:28.339
I don't think I'm
better than you.

38:28.340 --> 38:29.507
Oh, shut up.

38:29.508 --> 38:30.760
I didn't care about that.

38:30.761 --> 38:33.293
But then Franklin's city money
wasn't good enough for him.

38:33.294 --> 38:34.903
He had to move in on
my side business.

38:34.904 --> 38:35.950
So I did what I had to do...

38:38.250 --> 38:40.066
Aah! Aah!

38:40.067 --> 38:41.507
Ohh.

38:41.508 --> 38:42.345
Ah!

38:47.119 --> 38:47.958
Got it.

38:49.218 --> 38:50.559
Nice!

38:51.471 --> 38:54.248
There's a "Hamptons Heat"
twist I did not see coming.

38:54.777 --> 38:57.124
Sorry about the whole
"Accusing you of murder"...

38:57.125 --> 38:57.960
still buddies?

38:57.961 --> 38:58.794
Yeah.

39:03.472 --> 39:06.033
So it turns out that Jones
paid McMurray 500 bucks

39:06.034 --> 39:07.867
to point a finger at Bentley.

39:07.868 --> 39:10.509
Wow. $500 to ruin a
man's life, huh?

39:10.510 --> 39:12.098
And not to sound all Scooby,

39:12.099 --> 39:15.256
but he might have gotten away
with it if not for you, Castle.

39:16.129 --> 39:17.876
Well, I'm always
glad to help out

39:17.877 --> 39:19.597
my friends in law enforcement.

39:19.598 --> 39:20.608
Speaking of which,

39:20.609 --> 39:22.852
I would like to make a toast.

39:23.748 --> 39:25.025
Chief Brady,

39:25.026 --> 39:26.445
not everyone could've
handled themselves

39:26.446 --> 39:28.261
the way you did on
the dock today.

39:28.262 --> 39:29.347
You're a good cop.

39:29.348 --> 39:30.946
- Chief Brady.
- Here's to you.

39:30.947 --> 39:32.955
Thank you, Detective Beckett.

39:38.432 --> 39:39.358
Yeah.

39:40.255 --> 39:43.830
And you can rest assured,
your secret is safe with me.

39:44.041 --> 39:44.847
- Oh.
- Thank you.

39:44.848 --> 39:46.379
Yeah, thank you.

39:52.072 --> 39:53.482
I shot the bad guy.

39:53.483 --> 39:54.191
You did.

39:54.192 --> 39:55.479
Yeah, you did.

39:55.480 --> 39:55.863
Nice.

39:55.864 --> 39:57.007
Yeah.

39:58.143 --> 39:59.476
Ohh.

40:00.788 --> 40:02.042
Whew.

40:11.794 --> 40:12.919
I should go.

40:12.920 --> 40:14.069
Oh, of course. Oh, no.

40:14.070 --> 40:15.240
Find a new deputy. I...

40:15.241 --> 40:16.520
Yeah, you do.

40:16.521 --> 40:17.888
It was so great to meet you.

40:17.889 --> 40:18.757
You too.

40:18.758 --> 40:19.734
Yeah.

40:21.588 --> 40:23.827
- Bye.
- Bye.

40:23.828 --> 40:24.751
Let's go.

40:24.752 --> 40:25.891
Please.

40:26.357 --> 40:29.388
Well, the case in the
Hamptons has been solved,

40:29.389 --> 40:31.699
but the case of the
secret boyfriend

40:31.700 --> 40:33.066
remains open.

40:33.292 --> 40:35.694
Turns out Beckett's FBI ex

40:35.695 --> 40:37.694
has been stationed in
Europe for six months.

40:37.695 --> 40:38.523
Huh.

40:40.048 --> 40:41.333
What?

40:41.584 --> 40:42.790
You got anything?

40:45.664 --> 40:46.806
Nah.

40:47.472 --> 40:50.042
No, I was just thinking,
maybe we should drop it.

40:50.860 --> 40:53.333
You know, let Beckett's
private life stay private.

40:53.504 --> 40:55.061
What, you mean give up?

40:56.100 --> 40:58.633
A real detective never
gives up on a case, bro.

40:58.634 --> 41:01.043
You know it's not a
real case, right?

41:01.207 --> 41:03.752
You're gonna tell me
what a real case is?

41:03.753 --> 41:06.992
Uh, last time I checked, it's
when there was a murder.

41:06.993 --> 41:09.258
Oh, there's been a
murder all right.

41:09.484 --> 41:10.458
Your spirit.

41:10.459 --> 41:12.358
- Wow.
- Yeah. Your dignity, too.

41:12.359 --> 41:13.810
Huh. Well, you know what?

41:13.811 --> 41:15.581
Just for that, the
first round's on you.

41:15.582 --> 41:16.997
- Yeah, good luck with that.
- Bruce.

41:16.998 --> 41:17.525
Bruce.

41:23.142 --> 41:24.770
You know what's funny?

41:24.771 --> 41:27.124
My cover was that I was
coming out here to write,

41:27.125 --> 41:29.729
and I actually got
an idea for a book.

41:29.730 --> 41:31.513
Oh. "Hamptons Heat."

41:31.514 --> 41:33.712
So you're serious
about that, huh?

41:33.922 --> 41:36.301
Well, I already have the story.
That's the hardest part.

41:36.495 --> 41:39.009
So do you have an ending yet?

41:39.307 --> 41:40.736
Oh, well,

41:41.386 --> 41:42.656
I had some ideas,

41:42.657 --> 41:46.583
but, uh, I'm open
to suggestions.

41:46.882 --> 41:48.861
How about this?

41:49.072 --> 41:50.333
The weekend hadn't turned out

41:50.334 --> 41:54.003
exactly as Detective
Heat had imagined,

41:54.166 --> 41:56.066
but now nothing...

41:57.498 --> 42:00.020
not even another
murder on the beach

42:00.021 --> 42:04.125
could stop her from getting
exactly what she desired...

42:04.126 --> 42:05.769
most.

42:08.488 --> 42:09.994
Oh, that's good.

42:10.778 --> 42:11.913
Can I get a writer's credit?

42:11.914 --> 42:13.549
- We'll talk.
- Okay.
