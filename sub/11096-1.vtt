01:28.889 --> 01:30.556
Would you like
something sweet?

01:48.141 --> 01:50.743
What do we got here, fellas,
an antique show?

01:50.744 --> 01:52.545
All right, boys, fan out!

01:52.546 --> 01:54.912
What a wrinkle fest this is.

01:59.419 --> 02:02.150
Hey, beat it, you broads!
Come on!

02:02.289 --> 02:04.621
All right, sit down
and shut up!

02:06.226 --> 02:08.461
We're the Red Eyes.
So, everybody, freeze!

02:08.461 --> 02:11.998
Get their valuables, boys. I
want watches, wallets, jewelry.

02:11.999 --> 02:15.526
Get me some silver chains.
I want wigs. I want toupees.

02:18.438 --> 02:20.964
Keep an eye out
for me, will ya?

02:22.075 --> 02:25.211
No, not mine! Leave me alone!
I'm a veteran!

02:25.212 --> 02:28.204
No! Not that!

02:29.182 --> 02:31.344
I love crashing parties!

02:33.420 --> 02:35.855
Hey, cake!

02:39.226 --> 02:41.285
Pardon me, Fatty.

02:42.863 --> 02:46.356
But if you're going to eat
cake, you ought to use a fork.

02:46.967 --> 02:49.959
You might just as well
shovel it in.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.176
People who don't close
their mouths when they chew

02:57.177 --> 02:59.509
make me furious.

03:08.789 --> 03:11.280
One for you. Drat.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.083
And for you!

03:14.895 --> 03:16.863
Come on, come on.

03:18.131 --> 03:20.794
Want a little whipped cream,
Mr. Cherry Top?

03:22.369 --> 03:24.030
Get him, get him.

03:26.673 --> 03:29.609
Is that all you got, huh?
Is that all you...

03:35.449 --> 03:36.549
Throw it!

03:36.550 --> 03:38.916
Not today,
my vermilion-eyed varlet.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.355
Oh, blast.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.915
Out of the way!

03:55.235 --> 03:57.203
Yes, this one should stick.

04:02.542 --> 04:06.035
Oh, my! That's way
too tight, man!

04:24.765 --> 04:26.289
It's Captain Amazing!

04:27.834 --> 04:29.768
It's Amazing! I'm out of here!

04:51.725 --> 04:55.320
C.A., you were,
if I may say, amazing.

04:55.462 --> 04:56.629
Yeah?
Yeah.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.530
Let's go meet the press.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.096
He is good.

05:01.768 --> 05:03.402
He is rather ripping,
isn't he?

05:03.403 --> 05:05.929
The spinning and the hurting
and the kicking.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.836
I guarantee you he hogs
the credit on this one.

05:09.242 --> 05:11.043
Well, I think we have to

05:11.044 --> 05:13.536
at least concede him
the assist here, Roy.

05:14.047 --> 05:16.982
No, no. You see? That's
exactly what's holding us back.

05:16.983 --> 05:19.985
Don't put him on the pedestal,
put us on the pedestal.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.579
Here he comes.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.958
Bravo and huzzah, Captain.
Splendid work, as usual.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.727
No autographs till
we finish with the press.

05:28.728 --> 05:31.463
We're not...
Allow me to introduce myself.

05:31.464 --> 05:33.465
Blue Raja,
master of silverware,

05:33.466 --> 05:35.401
forks a specialty,
at your service.

05:35.402 --> 05:36.869
My colleague, the Shoveler.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.270
Big fan of your work.

05:38.271 --> 05:41.907
And standing rather painfully
aside is our cohort, Mr. Furious.

05:41.908 --> 05:43.042
How's it hanging?

05:43.043 --> 05:44.169
So you guys...

05:45.545 --> 05:48.071
They're superheroes.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.083
We fight crime. Call it
what you will. Quite right.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.553
That's great. Just, you know,

05:53.853 --> 05:55.788
keep up the good work.

05:56.423 --> 05:59.722
You as well, sir. You as well.

06:03.129 --> 06:04.864
Did you see... Did you...

06:04.865 --> 06:07.459
Did you hear that?
"Keep up the good work. "

06:07.601 --> 06:08.667
The good work.

06:08.668 --> 06:09.802
He's making fun of us.

06:09.803 --> 06:12.538
No, Roy. He saluted us. That was real.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.573
I thought he was sincere.
What's up, fellas?

06:14.574 --> 06:16.508
Hello.
Nice to see you.

06:17.177 --> 06:20.012
I saw the action
out there tonight.

06:20.013 --> 06:23.313
What you guys need is
a little bit of firepower.

06:23.450 --> 06:24.650
Well...

06:24.651 --> 06:26.380
I'm a weapons designer.

06:27.454 --> 06:29.121
I've got what you need.

06:29.122 --> 06:31.590
All right.
We'll come back.

06:31.591 --> 06:35.294
We'll visit all of you
people later. Thank you, sir.

06:35.295 --> 06:38.492
I don't live here.
I'm here for the ladies.

06:40.533 --> 06:42.559
Here, take my card.

06:44.304 --> 06:46.397
My name's Heller.
Say it with me.

06:47.173 --> 06:48.274
Heller.
Heller.

06:48.275 --> 06:50.800
All right. Thank you.

06:52.579 --> 06:53.746
Goodnight.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.514
I don't know why you encourage
those people.

06:55.515 --> 06:57.449
Those people look up to us.

06:57.450 --> 06:59.112
Oh, that's true.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.420
You know the drill.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.480
Please sign my hat,
Captain Amazing.

07:04.291 --> 07:05.952
Herman, give me a flash.

07:07.294 --> 07:08.761
Hey, how are you tonight?

07:08.762 --> 07:11.730
Captain, how did you know
where to find the Red Eyes?

07:11.731 --> 07:14.566
Becky, it's what I do.

07:14.567 --> 07:16.568
Thanks to you,
the city's almost crime-free.

07:16.569 --> 07:18.868
So what do you do
with your free time?

07:19.306 --> 07:21.140
I wish that I had
some free time.

07:21.141 --> 07:24.810
People are saying that you're so "amazing"
you're gonna put yourself out of a job.

07:24.811 --> 07:26.211
Have any comments on that?

07:26.212 --> 07:28.681
That's one problem
I look forward to.

07:28.682 --> 07:32.379
And is it true that you lost
your Pepsi endorsement?

07:34.254 --> 07:36.051
I hadn't heard that.

07:36.222 --> 07:38.457
Thanks so much for your questions.
Thank all of you so much.

07:38.458 --> 07:42.292
You sure, you have no comments
regarding your Pepsi situation?

07:50.470 --> 07:52.771
Look who we got.

07:52.772 --> 07:55.332
You again. Wannabes.

07:56.042 --> 07:58.177
This city already
has a superhero.

07:58.178 --> 08:01.013
Perhaps you've heard of him.
Captain Amazing.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.243
Thank you.

08:03.383 --> 08:05.851
Do yourself a favor, Maguire.

08:05.852 --> 08:07.886
Don't flip my switch tonight.

08:07.887 --> 08:12.382
And what exactly
would that do?

08:12.892 --> 08:16.095
Don't turn around, Roy. Don't
do it. Don't turn around.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.497
It's nothing. Keep walking, Roy.
Keep walking.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.466
It's not worth it.

08:22.202 --> 08:27.606
I think you know exactly what
that would do, checkerhead.

08:31.378 --> 08:32.606
What?

08:34.280 --> 08:36.476
Don't mess with
the volcano, my man.

08:38.551 --> 08:42.510
'Cause I will go Pompeii
on your butt.

08:45.091 --> 08:47.822
Oh, my golly.
Good grief.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.529
You keep dreaming, wannabe.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.163
Let's go.
Dream on, moron.

08:57.504 --> 09:00.633
I will keep dreaming. I will
keep dreaming, my friend.

09:01.007 --> 09:03.533
And when I wake up,
you better hope,

09:04.744 --> 09:06.678
you better hope you're asleep.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.048
Don't reengage him.
He's a silly...

09:09.049 --> 09:10.215
Sweet dreams!

09:10.216 --> 09:11.316
He's immature.

09:11.317 --> 09:12.444
Lilac.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.023
C.A., I'm doing my best.

09:18.024 --> 09:22.894
Your best? Quick question:
Is this your best?

09:23.329 --> 09:24.930
I realize you're upset.

09:24.931 --> 09:26.598
Victor, I'm positioned.

09:26.599 --> 09:31.136
Do you understand what that means?
On a very personal level here,

09:31.137 --> 09:33.906
to know that the companies
that make these fine products

09:33.907 --> 09:36.899
want me to be their
spokesperson? Their voice?

09:37.410 --> 09:40.079
I think right now we should
focus on the positive.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.775
Tonight was good.

09:42.282 --> 09:43.681
Yeah? You think so?

09:45.018 --> 09:48.477
'Cause I was worried it was,
I don't know, pathetic!

09:48.655 --> 09:50.389
"Amazing triumphs
at a nursing home!"

09:50.390 --> 09:52.051
That's great copy, Vic.

09:52.225 --> 09:54.250
I'm a publicist,
not a magician.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.562
You want big news,
you have to have big fights.

09:56.563 --> 10:00.522
A superhero needs a supervillain and,
thanks to you, we've got none left.

10:00.934 --> 10:04.203
Then get the Death Man.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.364
Death Man is dead.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.239
Okay. Father Doom.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.571
Life without parole.

10:08.908 --> 10:11.944
Apocalypta's doing 50 years.
Armagezzmo's in exile.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.745
Baron Von Chaos got the chair.

10:13.746 --> 10:14.847
Really?

10:14.848 --> 10:17.249
Casanova Frankenstein
is locked up in a nuthouse.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.048
Casanova Frankenstein.

10:19.586 --> 10:21.987
Now, there was a supervillain.

10:21.988 --> 10:24.924
You know, he just...

10:25.191 --> 10:27.660
He's got those eyes, you know?

10:27.794 --> 10:30.024
I can't do it, but...

10:30.363 --> 10:32.164
And that voice...
Such pure evil.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.967
The battles we used to have.
Extraordinary.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.299
"Used to. "

10:36.636 --> 10:39.765
That's the problem,
Captain. "Used to. "

11:14.674 --> 11:16.041
Let the record show

11:16.042 --> 11:18.410
that this parole hearing
has officially begun.

11:34.961 --> 11:40.058
We now commence the 17th parole
hearing of Casanova Frankenstein.

11:40.833 --> 11:42.699
Dr. Leek, you may begin.

11:44.103 --> 11:45.162
Thank you.

11:46.873 --> 11:50.108
Gentlemen of the board,
the man who sits before you,

11:50.109 --> 11:54.774
the once infamous evil genius,
is entirely cured.

11:55.081 --> 11:56.180
What?

11:56.215 --> 11:57.282
I give you my word

11:57.283 --> 12:01.550
that he's of no more danger
to the city than I am.

12:02.288 --> 12:03.355
This is outrageous.

12:03.356 --> 12:04.721
Yes.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.222
Mr. Casanova
Frankenstein,

12:07.594 --> 12:11.052
do you have anything to say
on your own behalf?

12:11.631 --> 12:15.659
Blessed disciples
of Hippocrates,

12:18.238 --> 12:21.571
my heart is split in two.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.306
It brims

12:25.912 --> 12:29.871
with such sorrow
for my abominable crimes.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.812
And yet,

12:32.151 --> 12:34.086
it swells with love

12:34.454 --> 12:36.115
for you,

12:37.190 --> 12:39.992
for this sanctuary,

12:39.993 --> 12:42.860
this place of healing.

12:43.930 --> 12:47.696
Within my soul,
I feel the choir singing

12:48.334 --> 12:51.133
Beethoven's immortal
Ode to Joy

12:52.705 --> 12:55.197
where all men

12:55.541 --> 12:58.410
become brothers.

13:01.314 --> 13:04.147
Am I too late to cast my vote?

13:04.717 --> 13:09.120
Not at all, Lance. I was
just about to remind the board

13:09.455 --> 13:13.725
that Casanova once had our city
in a stranglehold of terror.

13:13.726 --> 13:18.323
Parole is not an option
for this man, this monster.

13:18.865 --> 13:20.932
We cannot risk
the danger of releasing him.

13:20.933 --> 13:23.535
I could not agree
with you more.

13:23.536 --> 13:24.526
Excellent.

13:24.804 --> 13:30.409
However, I did just have dinner
with an old friend recently.

13:30.410 --> 13:33.378
Maybe you've heard of him?
Captain Amazing.

13:33.379 --> 13:34.579
Captain Amazing?

13:34.580 --> 13:38.210
He asked if I would read this.

13:41.387 --> 13:43.088
"Dear members of the board,

13:43.089 --> 13:45.557
"we all know that society
cannot exist

13:45.558 --> 13:47.754
"without absolute justice,

13:48.628 --> 13:53.896
"but society is also
built upon compassion.

13:54.567 --> 13:57.269
"Let us set the tone
for the new millennium

13:57.270 --> 13:59.771
"by making a historic
gesture of forgiveness.

13:59.772 --> 14:02.298
"Ladies and gentlemen,
I implore you,

14:02.608 --> 14:06.636
"let us grant
Casanova Frankenstein

14:07.747 --> 14:09.715
"a second chance. "

14:11.584 --> 14:17.182
With Captain Amazing's
recommendation and protection,

14:17.657 --> 14:21.252
I suppose we could consider.

14:22.428 --> 14:24.419
I pronounce you

14:28.601 --> 14:29.762
cured.

14:34.774 --> 14:37.937
Hello, Champion City.

14:41.681 --> 14:44.514
Daddy is home.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.033
Hi, everybody.

15:02.034 --> 15:04.703
You know, tooth decay
and gingivitis can be a crime.

15:04.704 --> 15:07.139
That's why I use
Mighty Whity toothpaste.

15:07.507 --> 15:11.102
Because I want my teeth
to look amazing.

15:13.446 --> 15:14.813
I'm gonna bring this up again.

15:14.814 --> 15:17.048
It's 150 bucks apiece.
We each chip in.

15:17.049 --> 15:19.484
My cousin knows this guy who
knows a publicist.

15:19.485 --> 15:23.355
What are we gonna publicize? The fact
that we get our butts kicked a lot.

15:23.356 --> 15:26.291
Maybe if you didn't smack me in the face
with the shovel every time we went out...

15:26.292 --> 15:28.360
All right now. ... we'd have
some more wins to brag about.

15:28.361 --> 15:31.229
I'm sorry, I just have a
tendency to lose my concentration

15:31.230 --> 15:33.398
when I've got a salad fork
stuck in my rear end.

15:33.399 --> 15:36.568
I get it. Your shovel
in his face is my fault.

15:36.569 --> 15:39.871
You threw a spoon
at the guy, Jeff.

15:39.872 --> 15:41.072
What was up with that?

15:41.073 --> 15:42.207
I'm embarrassed about that.

15:42.208 --> 15:43.308
I thought it was a fork.

15:43.309 --> 15:44.409
You're the master of cutlery.

15:44.410 --> 15:47.746
You can't throw a knife sometimes
when someone's trying to kill me?

15:47.747 --> 15:49.614
You can't use
a rake sometimes?

15:49.615 --> 15:50.715
No, I'm the Shoveler.

15:50.716 --> 15:53.084
I'm the Blue Raja.
I'm not Stab Man.

15:53.085 --> 15:56.121
I'm not Knifey Boy.
I'm the Blue Raja.

15:56.122 --> 15:57.189
That's another thing.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.290
What?

15:58.291 --> 16:00.659
You could get a little bit of
blue in the uniform somewhere.

16:00.660 --> 16:04.296
You've got green. There's
a little flowery thing.

16:04.297 --> 16:07.165
It doesn't make
a lot of sense.

16:07.166 --> 16:09.965
Just step out of our
literal minds for a moment.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.771
Hey, look what I'm doing.
Look at that.

16:12.772 --> 16:15.073
I'm putting 150 right on
the table. Who's in with me?

16:15.074 --> 16:17.209
I don't have 150, do I?

16:17.210 --> 16:19.845
If I did, I wouldn't have
plundered my mother's silverware.

16:19.846 --> 16:21.046
It's a waste of money.

16:21.047 --> 16:23.846
You know who doesn't think
it's a waste of money?

16:24.116 --> 16:25.350
Little Mr. Captain Amazing.

16:25.351 --> 16:26.451
Well, Captain...

16:26.452 --> 16:29.221
If we had a billionaire like
Lance Hunt as our benefactor,

16:29.222 --> 16:31.189
yeah, we could spend 150.

16:31.190 --> 16:33.058
Lance Hunt is Captain Amazing.

16:33.059 --> 16:35.892
Don't start that again.

16:36.529 --> 16:40.599
Lance Hunt wears glasses. Captain
Amazing doesn't wear glasses.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.601
He takes them off
when he transforms.

16:42.602 --> 16:46.004
That doesn't make any sense.
He wouldn't be able to see.

16:49.108 --> 16:51.076
Hi, thanks for waiting.

16:51.077 --> 16:52.909
Hey, thanks for dropping by.

16:53.145 --> 16:55.013
Do you know what you want?

16:55.014 --> 16:57.015
Allow me to begin, my dear.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.384
The Blue Raja is quite partial
to the salad ni9oise.

16:59.385 --> 17:01.987
My dressing of choice
is ranch lite,

17:01.988 --> 17:05.048
and I'd appreciate it
if you'd hold the Bacon Bits.

17:05.191 --> 17:08.859
Seeing as it's your first night and
all, I suppose I'll "fork-give" you

17:08.861 --> 17:10.996
if you "fork-get. "

17:12.164 --> 17:13.330
Who's next?

17:13.332 --> 17:16.300
Can I get a meatball sandwich
on white with mayo?

17:16.301 --> 17:19.371
I'll have a steak, please. Very
rare. That means pink, not bloody.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.006
And could I get some ice?

17:21.007 --> 17:24.108
I had a little mishap defending
justice at the nursing home.

17:24.109 --> 17:26.909
I thought I heard on TV
that was Captain Amazing.

17:29.549 --> 17:33.883
Let's all be good little automaton droids
and believe everything we hear on TV.

17:35.922 --> 17:39.119
I'll just go place
your order now.

17:41.160 --> 17:44.396
A trifle strident with that bit
of crumpet, weren't we, Furious?

17:44.397 --> 17:47.127
I am a ticking
time bomb of fury.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.669
All I'm saying is, when we
split the check three ways,

17:50.670 --> 17:53.338
the steak-eater picks
the pocket of the salad man.

17:53.339 --> 17:54.973
Just give me the money, Jeff.

17:54.974 --> 17:56.241
Yes, fine.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.710
Every time we split it
three ways.

17:58.711 --> 17:59.701
It's flipping robbery.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.381
Well, you should order more.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.211
Do you see what I see?

18:08.220 --> 18:09.721
Hello?

18:09.722 --> 18:10.989
It's Tony C.

18:10.990 --> 18:14.517
And Tony P,
leader of the Disco Boys.

18:24.770 --> 18:28.297
But why, pray tell,
would he be back in town?

18:29.442 --> 18:32.377
Maybe it's time to do a
little following to find out.

18:32.378 --> 18:34.176
No,
it's already 10:30.

18:34.413 --> 18:36.481
I'm gonna get killed
by my wife as it is.

18:36.482 --> 18:40.146
Yes, and I've had quite enough
excitement for one night, thank you.

18:40.319 --> 18:44.522
My mistake. I thought I was hanging
out with serious superheroes:

18:44.523 --> 18:46.157
The Shoveler
and the Blue Raja.

18:46.158 --> 18:50.261
But, apparently, I'm hanging
out with Lazy Boy and...

18:50.262 --> 18:51.363
Good night, Roy.

18:51.364 --> 18:52.464
Yes, toodle-oo.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.797
Hang on a second.
Lazy Boy and the...

18:56.268 --> 18:58.169
And the Recliner!

18:58.170 --> 19:01.265
Yeah, Lazy Boy
and the Recliner!

19:01.474 --> 19:03.806
Guys, are you coming?
Are you...

19:07.880 --> 19:11.549
Okay, fine. I guess tonight

19:11.550 --> 19:13.685
the lone wolf

19:13.686 --> 19:16.348
hunts alone.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.831
Testicles rising.

19:28.801 --> 19:31.327
Can't breathe. Can't breathe.

20:13.179 --> 20:16.512
Butch needs his vest back.
He's got a game on Saturday.

20:16.982 --> 20:19.584
Well, it's my vest too.
I bought it for him.

20:19.585 --> 20:22.213
The only thing I need...

20:22.421 --> 20:23.655
Okay.

20:23.656 --> 20:25.249
How long you gonna
do this, Eddie?

20:26.125 --> 20:28.159
It's been 12 years.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.150
I know.

20:30.362 --> 20:32.797
You got a family
to look after, Eddie.

20:32.965 --> 20:35.491
The kids are worried sick
about you.

20:35.735 --> 20:39.796
But still you go out, night after
night, running around the city for what?

20:40.072 --> 20:44.032
Lucille, God gave me a gift.

20:44.276 --> 20:47.779
I shovel well.
I shovel very well.

20:47.780 --> 20:52.984
Oh, baby, you shovel better
than any man I've known

20:52.985 --> 20:55.720
but that does not make you
a superhero.

20:55.721 --> 20:56.988
All I...

20:56.989 --> 20:57.979
Oh, no.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.126
You're a good husband

21:01.127 --> 21:03.459
and a good father,

21:03.762 --> 21:06.960
but that's all, nothing more.

21:11.137 --> 21:13.435
You're right.

21:14.406 --> 21:16.102
I believe in you, Daddy.

21:17.109 --> 21:20.102
Roland, do not
encourage your father.

21:25.117 --> 21:28.720
Well, if it isn't
our old friends, the Red Eyes.

21:28.721 --> 21:32.282
Good evening. We weren't expecting
to see you again so spoon...

21:36.328 --> 21:39.696
Red Eyes, Red Eyes.
What a treat.

21:39.932 --> 21:43.766
We weren't expecting to
see you again so spoon.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.571
Jeffrey.
Yeah?

21:46.572 --> 21:49.974
Mom, how many times have I
asked you not to barge in here?

21:50.643 --> 21:51.976
What's burning?

21:51.977 --> 21:53.077
Incense.

21:53.078 --> 21:55.680
I can't even count how many
rules you're breaking right now.

21:55.681 --> 21:58.783
One: Always knock. Two: Don't
sniff around outside my door.

21:58.784 --> 22:01.019
Three: Do not interrogate me.

22:01.020 --> 22:02.120
Jeffrey.

22:02.121 --> 22:03.179
What?

22:03.422 --> 22:05.117
Are you into marijuana?

22:05.925 --> 22:08.293
You're cheesing me off
so bad right now.

22:08.294 --> 22:09.861
Just, please... Good night.

22:09.862 --> 22:12.096
I'm sorry.
Jeffrey, please...

22:12.097 --> 22:13.164
Goodnight.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.223
Okay. Goodnight.

22:17.469 --> 22:19.137
God, she's just so...

22:55.174 --> 22:57.336
All right, let's see
what's shaking

22:57.610 --> 23:00.943
at the Chez Casa Casanova.

23:50.062 --> 23:53.760
Ah! The old disco room.

23:59.305 --> 24:01.806
Just as I left it.

24:01.807 --> 24:06.472
You've been locked up for 20 years. A
lot of things have changed since then.

24:07.479 --> 24:12.042
It must have been hard for you, the
way times and styles have changed,

24:13.652 --> 24:16.854
to hear the people saying
that disco is dead.

24:16.855 --> 24:19.882
Disco is not dead!
Disco is life!

24:20.159 --> 24:23.561
Yes, Tony, that is the passion
I remember.

24:27.599 --> 24:32.037
Stick with me, Tony,
and you will dance again

24:33.005 --> 24:35.030
when I rule this town.

24:40.579 --> 24:43.048
Have you met
my psychiatrist?

24:45.617 --> 24:48.353
Come out, come out
wherever you...

24:48.354 --> 24:50.288
There we go.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.590
Looks like we got
a little terrace party.

24:52.591 --> 24:55.822
I want you to spread
the word to all of my gangs.

24:56.528 --> 24:59.794
Tell them that
Casanova Frankenstein is back

24:59.999 --> 25:03.368
and that Casanova Frankenstein
is planning something

25:03.369 --> 25:05.360
a little bit different.

25:06.605 --> 25:08.073
Kaboom.

25:16.715 --> 25:18.206
Mama pajama!

25:21.420 --> 25:24.355
What kind of crazy man
blows up a crazy house?

25:24.356 --> 25:27.759
And now, if you will excuse
me, I am expecting a visit

25:27.760 --> 25:29.819
from a very old friend.

25:40.672 --> 25:43.904
Look what we got. A little
booty call from Captain Amazing.

25:47.846 --> 25:52.181
This is a fine,
elegant Harvey Wallbanger.

25:54.186 --> 25:56.951
Even when it's sucked
by scum like you?

25:57.389 --> 26:00.017
Captain Amazing.
What a surprise.

26:01.059 --> 26:03.927
Really? I'm not
so sure about that.

26:05.030 --> 26:08.666
Your first night of freedom,
and you blow up the asylum.

26:08.667 --> 26:11.500
Interesting choice.
I knew you couldn't change.

26:11.737 --> 26:12.937
I knew you'd know that.

26:12.938 --> 26:14.072
Oh, I know that.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.803
And I knew you'd know
I'd know you knew.

26:17.042 --> 26:21.206
But I didn't. I only knew
that you'd know that I knew.

26:22.448 --> 26:24.177
Did you know that?

26:26.618 --> 26:27.718
Of course.

26:27.719 --> 26:29.278
Please, won't you join me?

26:29.588 --> 26:30.578
With pleasure.

26:31.023 --> 26:32.890
Oh, quick thought.

26:32.891 --> 26:35.860
Would you mind removing
the submicronic laser

26:35.861 --> 26:38.463
in the ring on the index
finger of your left hand?

26:38.464 --> 26:41.032
Of course. And, if it
wouldn't be too much trouble,

26:41.033 --> 26:43.034
go ahead and disengage

26:43.035 --> 26:47.004
the psychotropic bacterium
dart-launchers in your slippers.

26:47.005 --> 26:48.539
Done.

26:48.540 --> 26:53.611
The cold fusion ultrasonic neuro-stunner
in your drink stirrer, turn it off.

26:53.612 --> 26:56.673
We know each other so well,
don't we, Lance?

26:57.382 --> 27:00.944
We've always been each other's
greatest nemesises.

27:01.453 --> 27:02.614
Nemesis...

27:03.655 --> 27:05.453
What's the plural on that?

27:06.725 --> 27:07.988
Nemeses.

27:08.694 --> 27:09.718
Whatever.

27:10.195 --> 27:12.830
You're going to prison
for life this time, Casanova.

27:12.831 --> 27:14.365
You see, here in
Champion City,

27:14.366 --> 27:17.233
we still do
a fairly brisk trade

27:18.170 --> 27:19.537
in justice.

27:19.538 --> 27:23.497
I thought it was all about the publicity
and keeping your sponsors happy.

27:23.675 --> 27:26.144
See, it's that kind
of cynicism that I truly feel

27:26.145 --> 27:28.846
is starting to poison society.

27:28.847 --> 27:30.781
Oh, looky here.

27:31.416 --> 27:34.051
A multi-frequency
radio detonator.

27:34.052 --> 27:37.188
You should be more careful when
discarding incriminating evidence.

27:37.189 --> 27:40.725
Oh, no. This is
an amusing little gizmo.

27:40.726 --> 27:42.694
It's really quite cool.

27:43.529 --> 27:45.895
Yeah? What is it?

27:48.767 --> 27:50.292
Yuck.

27:50.536 --> 27:54.836
It's a chloroform-deploying
portable enticement snare.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.501
Ah, dang!

28:04.016 --> 28:05.813
Oh, Lancie,

28:06.318 --> 28:08.252
you really are so predictable.

28:22.434 --> 28:23.701
Morning, Sally.

28:23.702 --> 28:24.802
You're late!

28:24.803 --> 28:26.170
Yes, I know.

28:26.171 --> 28:28.739
I was up all night, trying
to defend the city from evil,

28:28.740 --> 28:30.741
but I'm sure you don't
really care about that.

28:30.742 --> 28:34.078
Work starts at 0:00!
It's 0:25!

28:34.079 --> 28:36.480
So I guess all the junk's
probably ruined by now.

28:36.481 --> 28:39.951
Sucker, when are you gonna tear
down that jeep like I told you to?

28:39.952 --> 28:41.953
I thought we went
through this yesterday.

28:41.954 --> 28:45.723
That old jeep is actually
an armored car of some type.

28:45.724 --> 28:48.192
It was meant to withstand bombs. I
can't just rip it apart with a crowbar.

28:48.193 --> 28:50.025
Just junk it.

28:50.162 --> 28:52.730
If you gave me
the proper tools, I could...

28:52.731 --> 28:53.721
Junk it!

28:55.000 --> 28:57.735
I'm willing to have
this discussion with you,

28:57.736 --> 29:01.297
but I think we should deal with
it like two people who respect...

29:03.108 --> 29:04.809
I want it junked.

29:04.810 --> 29:06.811
Okay.

29:06.812 --> 29:09.212
Right now, I'm kind of like
a powder keg

29:09.348 --> 29:11.716
and you're the match.

29:11.717 --> 29:14.251
If you tell me to
junk it one more time...

29:14.252 --> 29:17.620
Junk it now! You got that?

29:33.805 --> 29:36.274
That little sucker
just saved your life.

29:37.876 --> 29:40.812
Just junk it,
you miserable cuss.

30:02.467 --> 30:05.269
We interrupt this program
to bring you breaking news.

30:05.270 --> 30:09.104
Champion City's best-known billionaire,
Lance Hunt, has disappeared.

30:09.341 --> 30:12.543
Police hope to enlist the help of
Captain Amazing in the search for Hunt,

30:12.544 --> 30:16.845
but have, so far, failed to contact
the city's beloved superhero.

30:19.651 --> 30:23.349
He makes a wonderful trophy,
don't you think?

30:25.257 --> 30:27.858
I really think we need
to talk about your plans here.

30:27.859 --> 30:30.226
Here are my plans, Lancie.

30:30.729 --> 30:34.532
Tomorrow night,
I'm going to kill you.

30:34.533 --> 30:37.301
Right. That's the part that
really doesn't work for me.

30:37.302 --> 30:42.331
When the clock strikes 12:00,
cuckoo, cuckoo,

30:42.574 --> 30:43.974
you will be dead,

30:43.975 --> 30:47.503
and my city will be given
a new state of mind.

30:47.646 --> 30:49.780
Clearly you gotta go with
what you're comfortable with,

30:49.781 --> 30:52.583
but, I don't know, I just
keep coming back to this place.

30:52.584 --> 30:54.752
I'm spitballing here,
but maybe

30:54.753 --> 30:59.423
we release the captain
to the authorities.

30:59.424 --> 31:02.026
I say that you're completely
reformed. Wink, wink.

31:02.027 --> 31:04.028
There is rejoicing
in the streets.

31:04.029 --> 31:08.532
At that point, you do the whole
destruction of the city thing.

31:08.533 --> 31:12.402
I mean, is it
a perfect plan? No.

31:12.904 --> 31:15.305
And I think that's what
I like about it.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.842
Jeez. Okay.

31:18.977 --> 31:21.446
That's great.
Turn off the lights now.

31:21.713 --> 31:24.882
It was just an idea!
Wait, I got a better one.

31:24.883 --> 31:28.285
You let me live,
I am your sidekick.

31:28.286 --> 31:32.553
I'm like Amazing Boy
or... Casanova?

31:33.625 --> 31:35.559
Are you sure
Captain Amazing is in there?

31:35.560 --> 31:37.654
Yeah, I'm sure.
Let's go.

32:15.233 --> 32:17.065
Wait! Hear that?

32:17.736 --> 32:19.636
We must have hit
a trip wire.

32:20.005 --> 32:22.606
It could be a photon
eviscerator heating up.

32:22.607 --> 32:26.010
It could be a cybernetic atom
scrambler. They target moving objects.

32:26.011 --> 32:28.979
Sounds more like a heat-seeking
anthrax projection gun to me.

32:28.980 --> 32:30.848
Quickly, cover your
mouth. No, let's bolt!

32:30.849 --> 32:32.883
Don't move! Don't breathe!
Let's bolt!

32:32.884 --> 32:34.185
Don't move! Don't breathe!

32:34.186 --> 32:35.319
Let's bolt!

32:37.422 --> 32:39.356
It's the sprinkler.

32:42.661 --> 32:46.330
Isn't that just fabu?
I'm positively soaked.

32:51.069 --> 32:53.137
What do we got here?

32:53.138 --> 32:56.403
I think they're supposed to be
jive superheroes.

32:56.675 --> 32:59.940
They made a big mistake
coming to Casanova's place.

33:04.683 --> 33:05.916
What's so funny?

33:05.917 --> 33:08.546
That's your power?
You have guns?

33:08.954 --> 33:11.121
Couldn't you be a little more
creative than that?

33:11.122 --> 33:13.057
Do forgive the impertinence,

33:13.258 --> 33:16.060
but what the devil does a
pistol have to do with disco?

33:16.061 --> 33:17.161
Weak.

33:17.162 --> 33:18.254
At best.

33:19.130 --> 33:22.658
Check out the guy with the
pipe. Are you the disco plumber?

33:23.535 --> 33:25.636
There's no theme
at all here, mates.

33:25.637 --> 33:29.073
Buddy, if you're gonna carry
a chain, make it a gold chain.

33:29.074 --> 33:31.775
See what I'm saying? And that's
just off the top of my head.

33:31.776 --> 33:33.377
Yo, what's up, Tiger Lily?

33:33.378 --> 33:35.176
The top of your head, huh?

33:42.187 --> 33:45.155
We'll never get in there.
There are too many Disco Boys.

33:45.156 --> 33:48.259
Look, I'm telling you. Amazing's
in there. I saw him go in.

33:48.260 --> 33:50.561
There's never any evil trios,
are there?

33:50.562 --> 33:54.226
No, they've all got to travel
in gangs like little babies.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.668
Maybe it's time
to level the playing field.

33:57.669 --> 33:58.659
How?

34:00.505 --> 34:02.206
I'm talking about recruiting.

34:02.207 --> 34:05.075
There's plenty of guys out there who
would kill to get in on our action.

34:05.076 --> 34:07.144
Plenty of posers,
you mean.

34:07.145 --> 34:08.512
Yeah, maybe a few.

34:08.513 --> 34:11.415
But there's got to be a
couple of guys out there, like,

34:11.416 --> 34:13.350
like a human torch.

34:13.351 --> 34:17.521
Or like a guy who can shoot
stinging foam into your eyes

34:17.522 --> 34:19.252
or something like that.

34:21.126 --> 34:22.960
There's the Sphinx,
of course.

34:22.960 --> 34:24.061
The what?

34:24.062 --> 34:25.362
The Sphinx.

34:25.362 --> 34:26.530
I know this guy.

34:26.531 --> 34:30.000
Big crime fighter from down south.
Big-league hitter down there.

34:30.001 --> 34:31.435
What's his power?

34:31.436 --> 34:32.835
He's terribly mysterious.

34:33.505 --> 34:35.539
That's it? That's his power?

34:35.540 --> 34:37.041
He's mysterious?

34:37.042 --> 34:39.076
Terribly mysterious.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.737
Plus, he can, like,

34:41.079 --> 34:43.813
cut guns in half
with his mind.

34:43.815 --> 34:46.909
Really? I hadn't heard that. I think.

34:47.185 --> 34:48.985
We'll have to track
this Sphinx guy down.

34:48.987 --> 34:52.616
Meantime, I have an idea
where we can get another guy.

34:53.358 --> 34:56.225
I'm free for lunch tomorrow.
How about you?

34:56.561 --> 34:58.928
Nothing I couldn't
move around.

35:10.575 --> 35:12.309
Why don't you guys
go on ahead?

35:12.310 --> 35:15.177
I gotta take care
of something.

35:15.380 --> 35:17.508
Oh, I see.

35:27.625 --> 35:30.151
Good cause there,
saving homeless animals.

35:30.495 --> 35:31.860
Yeah.

35:33.398 --> 35:35.264
Hog queen?

35:36.201 --> 35:37.334
What?

35:37.335 --> 35:38.666
You're into motorcycles.

35:39.304 --> 35:41.966
Oh. No. Not really.

35:42.674 --> 35:44.403
'Cause I got a motorcycle.

35:45.577 --> 35:47.311
Yeah, what kind?

35:47.312 --> 35:48.579
It's a Harley.

35:48.580 --> 35:49.638
A Harley.

35:50.515 --> 35:54.952
Compatible. It's a Harley compatible.
Basically, the same engineer.

35:56.187 --> 35:57.521
Look,

35:57.522 --> 36:00.355
I hope we're cool
about last night.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.359
Last night?

36:02.360 --> 36:06.058
Like I said, I was kind of
in scary mode back there.

36:06.498 --> 36:10.059
Sometimes that comes off as a
little threatening or whatever.

36:10.635 --> 36:11.935
I don't find you threatening.

36:11.936 --> 36:15.406
You're very kind.

36:15.407 --> 36:16.704
At all.

36:18.343 --> 36:19.710
Listen, I still feel like

36:19.711 --> 36:23.113
I should make it up to you
somehow, just in some way.

36:24.049 --> 36:27.317
I should take you out to dinner or
something to make up for being so scary,

36:27.318 --> 36:28.419
or whatever.

36:28.420 --> 36:29.717
I'm really busy.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.292
Right.

36:37.162 --> 36:39.631
Our little chess game
continues.

36:42.367 --> 36:43.467
Yeah?

36:43.468 --> 36:46.836
We're looking for the one
they call "The Invisible Boy. "

36:47.739 --> 36:50.274
All my life,
I've been ignored by people.

36:50.275 --> 36:52.843
Finally, after years
of being overlooked,

36:52.844 --> 36:56.212
I found I have
the power to disappear.

36:56.781 --> 36:58.749
It's real ironic how
it happened 'cause...

36:58.750 --> 36:59.740
Can we come in?

37:01.052 --> 37:02.286
Yeah, sure. Come on.

37:02.287 --> 37:03.387
Thank you.

37:03.388 --> 37:06.619
Dad, I'm going to my room
with three strange men.

37:08.993 --> 37:10.227
And that's pretty much it.

37:10.228 --> 37:13.030
So, let me get this straight.

37:13.031 --> 37:15.693
You do have the ability
to become invisible?

37:16.267 --> 37:17.434
Yes.

37:17.435 --> 37:19.403
But you can't give us
a demonstration?

37:19.404 --> 37:23.466
No, I can only become invisible
when no one's watching.

37:24.476 --> 37:27.377
So, you're only invisible
to yourself?

37:27.378 --> 37:31.816
No. If I look at myself,
I become visible again.

37:33.384 --> 37:38.379
So, you can only become invisible
when absolutely nobody is watching you?

37:40.225 --> 37:41.825
Yes.

37:41.826 --> 37:43.453
Do forgive our incredulity,

37:43.695 --> 37:48.257
but I'm wondering how you can be certain
you've achieved transparency at all?

37:50.235 --> 37:54.194
When you go invisible,
you can feel it.

37:56.708 --> 37:57.908
I'm leaving.

37:57.909 --> 37:59.276
Thanks a lot.
It was nice to have met you.

37:59.277 --> 38:02.479
Wait, guys. Don't go. Where
you guys going? Don't go.

38:02.480 --> 38:04.449
Can I come?

38:05.950 --> 38:07.618
Look, no offense, kid,

38:07.619 --> 38:10.387
we're about to go up against
a really powerful supervillain,

38:10.388 --> 38:12.523
Casanova Frankenstein.

38:12.524 --> 38:15.325
That means we gotta find a lot
of superheroes really quickly.

38:15.326 --> 38:17.794
And to tell you the truth, we have
no idea where to even start, so...

38:17.795 --> 38:19.593
I know tons of superheroes.

38:20.532 --> 38:21.799
I'm sure
you know a lot...

38:21.800 --> 38:22.900
No, no, no, seriously.

38:22.901 --> 38:26.170
I'm out there all the time at the
costume shops, martial arts stores

38:26.171 --> 38:28.238
talking to guys
and making connections.

38:28.239 --> 38:30.765
If you want to break in,
you gotta network,

38:31.409 --> 38:33.844
and I know how to network.

38:33.845 --> 38:35.142
Sorry, kid.

38:35.647 --> 38:36.875
Come on.

38:37.282 --> 38:39.375
Haven't you guys
ever been a kid?

38:40.218 --> 38:43.051
Haven't you guys
ever had a dream?

38:52.096 --> 38:54.731
Let me see, who else have
I met? There's the Pincher.

38:54.732 --> 38:55.799
"Pincher. "

38:55.800 --> 38:56.900
The Pickler.

38:56.901 --> 38:58.368
Princess Headbutt.

38:58.369 --> 39:00.470
White Flight and the Black
Menace. They work together.

39:00.471 --> 39:01.962
Slow down, slow down.

39:02.307 --> 39:04.707
Then there's,
Professor Pink Belly,

39:04.843 --> 39:07.243
and Lucky Pierre
and The French Tickler.

39:07.478 --> 39:09.276
"French Tickler. "

39:09.681 --> 39:11.915
You've got all
their telephone numbers?

39:11.916 --> 39:13.016
Yeah, most of them.

39:13.017 --> 39:15.385
We've got to figure out a way
to get them all in one place.

39:15.386 --> 39:16.854
That's quite right.

39:16.988 --> 39:18.522
Some kind of a tryout.

39:18.523 --> 39:20.013
Yes, a tryout.

39:20.758 --> 39:23.293
Throw in a barbecue and a couple
of kegs, they'll all show up.

39:23.294 --> 39:25.596
The mooch factor's pretty high
with this crowd.

39:25.597 --> 39:27.588
A barbecue,
that's a good idea.

39:28.333 --> 39:32.236
What? Bugger all, it's
the Spleen. Play dead.

39:32.237 --> 39:33.303
Who's that?

39:33.304 --> 39:35.102
Turn your head.
Don't say anything.

39:49.921 --> 39:51.154
Hiya, fellas.

39:51.155 --> 39:54.625
Word on the street is you're
looking for superheroes.

39:54.626 --> 39:55.726
Not really.

39:55.727 --> 39:57.027
Actually,
we're just leaving.

39:57.028 --> 39:59.096
Rotten luck.

39:59.097 --> 40:01.265
Oh, here we go.

40:01.266 --> 40:02.399
Perfect timing.

40:02.400 --> 40:03.424
That's for you.

40:04.669 --> 40:05.936
Hamburger, right?

40:05.937 --> 40:07.029
Yes, thank you.

40:07.171 --> 40:08.537
Enjoy.

40:09.207 --> 40:12.509
Why are you guys always dissing
me? It hurts my feelings.

40:12.510 --> 40:14.845
I'm a superhero too.
I have powers.

40:14.846 --> 40:17.247
Really? Like what?

40:17.248 --> 40:18.715
So glad you asked.

40:18.716 --> 40:19.783
Oh, no.

40:19.784 --> 40:20.851
Excuse me.

40:20.852 --> 40:22.615
Excuse me. Excuse me.

40:25.023 --> 40:28.459
It all started when I
was just 13 years of age.

40:28.860 --> 40:30.527
One day, while walking
with some friends,

40:30.528 --> 40:32.895
I accidentally cut the cheese.

40:33.031 --> 40:36.133
Well, in my
adolescent awkwardness,

40:36.134 --> 40:39.661
I blamed it on an old gypsy woman
who happened to be passing by.

40:39.871 --> 40:41.862
Big mistake!

40:42.373 --> 40:45.375
The gypsy woman placed a curse
upon my head.

40:45.376 --> 40:47.311
Because I smelled it,

40:47.312 --> 40:51.840
she decreed I would
forevermore be he who dealt it!

40:52.617 --> 40:53.750
Let me illustrate.

40:53.751 --> 40:54.851
No,
you don't have to.

40:54.852 --> 40:56.787
It's not necessary, really.

40:58.356 --> 41:00.791
Let's see.

41:00.792 --> 41:04.057
Distance: 7 meters.

41:05.196 --> 41:06.857
Air speed: Normal.

41:07.732 --> 41:09.723
Compensate for
air conditioning.

41:11.769 --> 41:12.903
Pull my fingers.

41:12.904 --> 41:13.894
Don't do it.

41:14.405 --> 41:16.339
Oh, dear God.

41:17.075 --> 41:20.067
S.B.D.!

41:28.152 --> 41:30.120
Silent but deadly.

41:30.121 --> 41:31.788
That's good shooting.

41:31.789 --> 41:32.923
That was amazing!

41:32.924 --> 41:35.359
It's disgusting.
Don't encourage him.

41:36.494 --> 41:39.725
You guys are recruiting
for superheroes.

41:40.598 --> 41:42.432
Where you holding
the tryouts?

41:42.433 --> 41:43.900
We don't know yet,

41:43.901 --> 41:46.734
as soon as we figure that out,
we'll get in touch immediately.

41:47.372 --> 41:51.706
Bet we'd get a big turnout if we did
it somewhere with a swimming pool.

41:52.377 --> 41:54.504
Oh, no. No, no, no.

41:54.846 --> 41:58.407
Absolutely not. Nope. No.

42:04.555 --> 42:06.056
I don't deserve this.

42:06.057 --> 42:07.183
I know.

42:08.993 --> 42:11.194
A lot of other men
I could have married.

42:11.195 --> 42:12.496
I understand.

42:12.497 --> 42:16.695
If one person vomits in my
pool, I'm gonna divorce you.

42:17.235 --> 42:18.862
That's fair.

42:19.070 --> 42:21.038
Come on, kids!

42:27.612 --> 42:29.341
State your name and power.

42:29.747 --> 42:31.348
I am the Waffler.

42:31.349 --> 42:34.618
With my griddle of justice,
I bash the enemy in the head

42:34.619 --> 42:36.520
or I burn them like so.

42:37.588 --> 42:39.656
Don't do that.

42:39.657 --> 42:43.860
I also have my truth
syrup, which is low fat.

42:43.861 --> 42:45.962
And I've been working
on a theme song.

42:45.963 --> 42:48.865
Waffle man,
I am the Waffler

42:48.866 --> 42:52.234
Golden crispy,
bad guys are history

42:53.738 --> 42:56.039
And I'm running.
Just think about it.

42:56.040 --> 42:58.508
Do you have a health plan?
Maybe dental? Eye?

42:58.509 --> 42:59.576
Next.

42:59.577 --> 43:02.569
Hi. I am Pencilhead.

43:03.147 --> 43:05.548
And I am
Son of Pencilhead!

43:05.850 --> 43:06.917
We erase crime.

43:06.918 --> 43:08.051
Two generations of...

43:08.052 --> 43:09.786
Right.
Yes, thank you.

43:09.787 --> 43:10.887
Did I do all right?

43:10.888 --> 43:12.789
Yeah, I think they liked us.

43:12.790 --> 43:14.850
Now, say...

43:15.093 --> 43:17.254
I'm the Ballerina Man.

43:19.831 --> 43:21.924
I don't need to see that.

43:31.342 --> 43:32.366
Thanks.

43:32.977 --> 43:34.342
I am...
Hey!

43:34.612 --> 43:36.746
You copied me.
You copied me.

43:36.747 --> 43:38.148
Did not!
Liar!

43:38.149 --> 43:40.743
Ladies, now let's play nicely.

43:51.762 --> 43:53.492
I'd say there's potential.

43:54.365 --> 43:58.928
I be the Bullfighter.
I fight the bull!

43:59.437 --> 44:02.236
Greetings, fellow crime
fighters. I am Radio Man.

44:03.040 --> 44:04.174
I am Squeegeeman.

44:04.175 --> 44:05.442
Do you sense its power?

44:05.443 --> 44:06.543
Yes.

44:06.544 --> 44:11.106
P.M.S. Avenger. I work 4 days a
month. Is there a problem with that?

44:11.315 --> 44:12.849
No.
No.

44:12.850 --> 44:13.917
Whatever you say.

44:13.918 --> 44:15.085
We'll get back to you.

44:15.086 --> 44:16.186
Quite all right.

44:16.187 --> 44:17.287
Whatever.

44:17.288 --> 44:18.881
Okay, that's it.

44:29.934 --> 44:32.062
That was
a complete waste of time.

44:32.370 --> 44:34.429
Like so many things we do.

44:36.541 --> 44:40.210
Hi. Hi, you guys.
Am I too late to try out?

44:40.211 --> 44:42.279
What time is it?
I don't have a watch on.

44:42.280 --> 44:46.341
Yeah. Sorry. You'll have to pretend
to be a superhero somewhere else.

44:46.517 --> 44:48.781
Really? I see.

44:49.487 --> 44:51.421
That's fine.

45:11.909 --> 45:13.434
Look out!

45:15.479 --> 45:16.913
Look out!

45:27.625 --> 45:30.492
I guess I'll just have to
take my ball and go home.

45:30.861 --> 45:33.029
No. You can't go.
Miss, please.

45:33.030 --> 45:35.031
Where you going?
That was cool.

45:35.032 --> 45:36.728
Wait. Stop her.

45:37.034 --> 45:39.502
Hold on. Stop her.
Settle down.

45:39.503 --> 45:41.338
That was great.

45:41.339 --> 45:42.872
We might be able to squeeze in
one more interview.

45:42.873 --> 45:45.709
Yes, seeing as how you
schlepped your ball all this way.

45:45.710 --> 45:46.843
Appreciate that. Thanks.

45:46.844 --> 45:48.312
You're really good.

45:48.546 --> 45:50.605
What's up?
I'm the Spleen.

45:51.182 --> 45:53.617
I'm the Bowler.
How you doing?

45:53.618 --> 45:55.245
You're very attractive.

45:56.921 --> 45:58.254
That's because
it's ambrosia.

45:58.255 --> 46:01.358
Why don't you tell us
a little bit about yourself.

46:01.359 --> 46:03.927
Help us understand why
we should choose you

46:03.928 --> 46:06.062
over all the other
qualified applicants.

46:06.063 --> 46:07.163
What other
qualified applicants?

46:07.164 --> 46:08.860
Eddie, please.

46:09.934 --> 46:12.665
Start at the top.
Where did you get your powers?

46:13.537 --> 46:15.529
I got my powers
from my father.

46:16.173 --> 46:17.470
Okay. Who's he?

46:17.742 --> 46:19.943
Have you ever heard of
Carmine the Bowler?

46:19.944 --> 46:21.311
Have we ever heard...

46:21.312 --> 46:25.281
Cor blimey, don't tell us
you're the Bowler's daughter.

46:25.282 --> 46:28.618
I seem to remember there being a
little controversy around his death.

46:28.619 --> 46:30.420
That's right. The police
said it was an accident.

46:30.421 --> 46:33.623
He'd come home late one night
and fell down an elevator shaft

46:33.624 --> 46:35.191
onto some bullets.

46:35.192 --> 46:38.395
I've always suspected
a bit of foul play.

46:38.396 --> 46:40.023
As have I.

46:40.431 --> 46:42.432
So now daddy's little girl
is all grown up,

46:42.433 --> 46:44.768
looking for a little revenge,
is that it?

46:44.769 --> 46:47.499
Yeah, that is it.
Is there a problem with that?

46:47.638 --> 46:48.738
Why don't you tell me?

46:48.739 --> 46:49.839
I don't know. You tell me.

46:49.840 --> 46:56.446
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you tell me?

46:59.950 --> 47:02.185
All right. You've seen
what I can do.

47:02.186 --> 47:04.354
You either want to use
my talents or you don't.

47:04.355 --> 47:07.057
If you don't, I seek another
cabal, and we do it that way.

47:07.058 --> 47:09.259
We need you.
We definitely need you.

47:09.260 --> 47:10.250
Indeed.

47:10.461 --> 47:11.929
Bowler... Evelyn...

47:12.263 --> 47:14.397
Carol.

47:14.398 --> 47:17.265
Will you join
our little ragtag trio?

47:17.635 --> 47:19.269
I think you mean quartet...

47:19.270 --> 47:21.966
What are you talking about?
There's five of us.

47:22.973 --> 47:26.808
Nobody's green lit new
memberships, so just chill out.

47:27.912 --> 47:30.380
Granted, you've got a good
arm. I'll give you that.

47:30.381 --> 47:32.148
But we're in a lead cad...

47:32.149 --> 47:33.650
Cadre.

47:33.651 --> 47:35.018
You're in.
Welcome aboard.

47:35.019 --> 47:36.953
Guys, would you...

47:36.954 --> 47:38.922
What? What's the problem?

47:39.223 --> 47:40.554
Welcome.

47:40.991 --> 47:42.158
What?

47:42.159 --> 47:44.890
Nothing. No problem.
Welcome aboard.

47:54.038 --> 47:56.039
So what's up? Are Spleen
and I on the team or not?

47:56.040 --> 47:58.875
In my opinion, which used
to matter around here,

47:58.876 --> 48:00.577
we shouldn't be
flinging memberships

48:00.578 --> 48:03.413
at every guy who puts together a
pair of matching gloves and boots.

48:03.414 --> 48:06.382
You guys just be sure to jump
in when the action starts.

48:06.383 --> 48:08.318
You do your share,
we'll keep you around.

48:08.319 --> 48:09.419
Maybe.

48:09.420 --> 48:12.489
So you're a British man who
converted to Islam like Cat Stevens?

48:12.490 --> 48:18.292
No. Until the early part of this century,
India was part of the British Empire,

48:18.529 --> 48:20.897
whose government there
was called the British Raj,

48:20.898 --> 48:23.299
after the Hindi word
for "sovereignty. "

48:23.300 --> 48:24.400
Furthermore...

48:24.401 --> 48:25.869
Wait. So sorry. What?

48:26.837 --> 48:28.138
Dad.

48:28.139 --> 48:30.608
No, he's not
a commie nor a fruit.

48:31.275 --> 48:32.743
Sorry.

48:34.178 --> 48:36.079
His ignorance embarrasses me.

48:36.080 --> 48:40.316
Sorry, but am I to understand
you've inserted your father's skull

48:40.317 --> 48:42.352
inside of that ball
for bowling?

48:42.353 --> 48:44.844
No. The guy at
the pro shop did it.

48:48.092 --> 48:49.659
That was Casanova's limo.

48:49.660 --> 48:52.896
You bet your sweet bippy it was.
Let's turn this sucker around!

48:52.897 --> 48:55.058
He's probably got
Amazing in there.

48:59.336 --> 49:00.537
Here we go.

49:00.538 --> 49:02.605
I feel carsick.

49:02.606 --> 49:03.733
Great.

49:05.276 --> 49:08.803
So tell me, who can we count on
seeing at my banquet tomorrow?

49:09.079 --> 49:11.548
All the top gangs
are gonna be there, Cas.

49:11.549 --> 49:14.518
They want to know
what you got up your sleeve.

49:16.720 --> 49:20.657
Mr. Casanova,
I think we're being followed.

49:37.708 --> 49:39.870
Let us say hello.

49:47.017 --> 49:48.349
What's he doing?

49:48.719 --> 49:50.881
He's either very smart
or very dumb.

50:06.971 --> 50:08.199
Hello.

50:08.472 --> 50:11.305
I would like a double burger
with the large fries.

50:11.742 --> 50:14.277
Do you boys
want something to drink?

50:15.679 --> 50:18.512
We think you did something
bad to Captain Amazing.

50:18.649 --> 50:20.683
We would like you
to tell us where he is.

50:20.684 --> 50:23.916
Captain who? This name does
not ring any bells with me.

50:24.321 --> 50:26.756
I don't like your tone,
Frankenpuss.

50:27.391 --> 50:29.359
Do yourself a favor
and don't punch my clock.

50:29.360 --> 50:31.886
I'm a Pantera's box
you do not want to open.

50:32.062 --> 50:33.396
It is Pandora.

50:33.397 --> 50:35.965
Please don't correct me.

50:35.966 --> 50:37.300
It sickens me.

50:37.301 --> 50:39.668
You guys never learn, do you?

50:40.037 --> 50:42.734
Apparently we don't, ass.

50:43.574 --> 50:44.674
I know you.

50:44.675 --> 50:45.836
You don't know me.

50:46.644 --> 50:48.244
You knew my father.
Sal.

50:48.245 --> 50:49.645
Carmine.
Carmine.

50:49.947 --> 50:52.882
Carmine? The Bowler?

50:52.883 --> 50:53.950
Yep.

50:53.951 --> 50:55.418
You're Baby Bowler?

50:55.419 --> 50:56.653
Is that a problem?

50:56.654 --> 50:57.712
Hello.

50:58.522 --> 51:01.116
I'm the guy that gave
your daddy the shaft.

51:01.759 --> 51:04.319
This is the last time
I'm going to ask you:

51:05.162 --> 51:06.796
Where is Captain Amazing?

51:06.797 --> 51:09.528
And a diet Pepsi
with a little bit of ice.

51:15.105 --> 51:17.040
Hey, Shove!

51:23.514 --> 51:25.380
Boys, let's go.

51:27.618 --> 51:29.313
Fork yourself!

51:34.658 --> 51:35.989
Pull!

51:54.378 --> 51:56.045
Come on, Roy,
let's get out of here.

51:56.046 --> 51:58.140
Come on, Furious! Let's go!

51:59.083 --> 52:01.284
People who live
in glass houses, shouldn't.

52:01.285 --> 52:03.185
Because this is what happens!

52:04.822 --> 52:06.289
Come on!
That's enough!

52:06.290 --> 52:08.224
Come on. Get out of the way.

52:10.260 --> 52:12.395
The roof is on fire! The roof!

52:12.396 --> 52:15.598
The roof is on fire!

52:15.599 --> 52:19.297
We don't need no water.
We don't need no water.

52:20.437 --> 52:22.133
Here comes Daddy.

52:35.586 --> 52:37.110
Go, go, go!

52:56.507 --> 52:59.776
I would like to make a toast to
our first straightout victory.

52:59.777 --> 53:01.244
Stunning victory.
Here, here.

53:01.245 --> 53:03.146
The relationship you have
with your mother

53:03.147 --> 53:05.214
affects every other
dynamic in your life.

53:05.215 --> 53:07.377
What? What?
It's true, quite true.

53:08.385 --> 53:12.151
Yes, a father's role is vital in a
child's life as well. I know this.

53:12.356 --> 53:14.457
No, I'm not disrespecting you.

53:14.458 --> 53:18.628
You have to respect me too. You have to
allow me to have conversations in a bar

53:18.629 --> 53:20.797
and talk to my new friends.

53:20.798 --> 53:22.891
Anyway, I'm an adult now.

53:24.068 --> 53:25.768
Do you want to go
back in the bag?

53:25.769 --> 53:28.864
Is that how we're gonna do
it now? You make the rules.

53:29.306 --> 53:31.240
If you don't zip it...

53:35.846 --> 53:37.880
Sheesh.

53:37.881 --> 53:41.651
I was going to say that parents
can be quite problematic.

53:41.652 --> 53:42.983
Tell me about it.

53:47.591 --> 53:51.728
There's not enough beer in the
world. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

53:51.729 --> 53:54.163
It's okay. It's okay.
Listen.

53:54.164 --> 53:56.165
You've got to live
in truth. Correct?

53:56.166 --> 53:58.965
The woman's a tiger.

54:04.508 --> 54:06.576
Barkeep, another round

54:06.577 --> 54:10.445
for my sweet team
of superfriends.

54:10.647 --> 54:13.412
Barkeep, another round
for the super,

54:14.718 --> 54:16.886
super bellies.

54:18.155 --> 54:20.089
That's what's so cool
about this team:

54:20.090 --> 54:24.027
Everyone has their own powers for
all these different situations.

54:24.328 --> 54:25.828
Pull my finger.

54:32.169 --> 54:33.336
What?

54:33.337 --> 54:35.305
I was just thinking.

54:35.472 --> 54:38.999
I was wondering when we might
see your super power.

54:41.345 --> 54:44.576
It'll happen, kid.
Don't worry.

54:46.583 --> 54:49.719
I say, "sabatage. "
"Sabatage?"

54:49.720 --> 54:51.954
The Shoveler
is hammered!

54:51.955 --> 54:54.288
The Shoveler is hammered!

55:02.766 --> 55:04.133
So what's the name
of this team?

55:04.134 --> 55:05.401
How about the Super Squad?

55:05.402 --> 55:08.861
How about the Six Dead Guys
in Their Stupid Costumes?

55:09.239 --> 55:12.508
No. The Magnificent Dead Guys.
How about that?

55:12.509 --> 55:14.773
What about
the Legendary Superfreaks?

55:14.912 --> 55:17.472
Way too positive.
They totaled our car.

55:27.224 --> 55:28.591
Ready?

55:28.592 --> 55:29.650
Ready!

55:31.361 --> 55:32.461
Aim.

55:32.462 --> 55:33.589
Aim!

55:34.865 --> 55:36.128
I love you!

55:37.034 --> 55:38.058
Fire!

55:47.177 --> 55:50.479
Six Very Nearly Dead Guys With
a Temporary Reprieve.

55:50.480 --> 55:52.048
That's it. That's your name.

55:52.049 --> 55:53.516
Six Jive Turkeys.

55:53.517 --> 55:54.617
Dig, man?

55:54.618 --> 55:55.985
Yeah! Dig, man!

55:55.986 --> 56:00.355
That's your name.
Kill you later, superlosers!

56:05.429 --> 56:08.956
Criminy.
You're the Sphinx.

56:09.099 --> 56:10.828
And you are fools.

56:11.501 --> 56:12.969
Tonight

56:13.237 --> 56:15.000
you proved

56:15.706 --> 56:17.765
your inexperience.

56:18.108 --> 56:21.510
The wise man knows
that he is weakest

56:22.045 --> 56:24.446
when he thinks himself strong.

56:24.581 --> 56:25.815
Whoa.

56:25.816 --> 56:27.648
This is serious.

56:28.252 --> 56:29.742
Terribly mysterious.

56:29.953 --> 56:31.887
Casanova Frankenstein

56:32.122 --> 56:33.851
is no ordinary villain.

56:34.258 --> 56:35.725
To fight him,

56:36.226 --> 56:39.695
you must have
extraordinary skill.

56:39.696 --> 56:42.231
Thank you for that
little piece of information.

56:42.232 --> 56:44.000
I wouldn't have thought...

56:44.001 --> 56:45.434
Excuse me!

56:45.435 --> 56:47.136
Does anybody have any manners?

56:47.137 --> 56:48.237
I don't know. Do I?

56:48.238 --> 56:49.505
I don't know. Do you?
Do I?

56:49.506 --> 56:52.375
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you tell me?

56:52.376 --> 56:54.310
I don't know. You tell me.
Do I mind what? Do I?

56:54.311 --> 56:55.611
Silence!

56:55.612 --> 56:58.681
We'll have to
separate you two.

56:58.682 --> 57:01.413
Is that what you want?
You want to be separated?

57:01.685 --> 57:03.084
He started it.

57:04.288 --> 57:08.452
You must be
like the wolf pack,

57:09.192 --> 57:11.894
not like the six pack.

57:11.895 --> 57:13.659
Teamwork. Yes!

57:13.797 --> 57:17.461
You were not ready to face
so great an enemy.

57:18.068 --> 57:22.266
Not until you have vanquished
the enemy within yourselves.

57:22.706 --> 57:23.696
Yes!

57:24.274 --> 57:25.742
It's cool, isn't it?

57:25.876 --> 57:30.313
It goes right up to the point
of being, like, confusing.

57:30.781 --> 57:34.410
It's leadership.
It's what we've been missing.

57:34.851 --> 57:36.717
Yes, I quite agree.

57:37.354 --> 57:41.023
Sphinx, will you guide our
motley little gang of men at arms?

57:41.024 --> 57:43.793
Hey! Wait a minute.

57:43.794 --> 57:45.728
Are you serious? Come on.

57:46.063 --> 57:48.097
Will you shape us,
mold us?

57:48.098 --> 57:51.133
Please unify us
and make us whole.

57:51.134 --> 57:53.034
To learn my teachings,

57:53.603 --> 57:56.198
I must first teach you

57:56.974 --> 57:58.202
how to learn.

58:09.720 --> 58:12.221
Learn to hide your strikes
from your opponent,

58:12.222 --> 58:15.317
and you'll more easily
strike his hide.

58:24.835 --> 58:26.769
How many weapons do you wield?

58:26.770 --> 58:27.828
Just one, Sphinx.

58:28.305 --> 58:31.673
No. The fist, the knee,
the elbow, the head!

58:31.908 --> 58:33.609
You must lash out
with every limb

58:33.610 --> 58:36.170
like the octopus
who plays the drums.

58:41.084 --> 58:42.814
Why am I doing this again?

58:43.086 --> 58:45.388
When you can balance
a tack hammer on your head,

58:45.389 --> 58:48.586
you will head off your foes
with a balanced attack.

58:49.526 --> 58:52.461
And why am I wearing the
watermelon on my feet?

58:59.903 --> 59:02.668
I don't remember
telling you to do that.

59:04.741 --> 59:07.870
Wait a minute. Wait. Wait.

59:26.730 --> 59:28.789
I believe in my powers.

59:29.065 --> 59:31.296
I believe in my powers.

59:31.635 --> 59:34.798
I believe in the powers
of my teammates.

59:35.105 --> 59:38.165
I believe in the powers
of my teammates.

59:38.442 --> 59:42.845
I trust in my powers.

59:43.013 --> 59:45.846
I trust in the powers
of my teammates.

59:46.149 --> 59:49.745
I trust in the powers
of my teammates.

59:51.455 --> 59:54.390
This team must learn
to work together

59:54.391 --> 59:58.555
or, mark my words,
it will be torn apart!

01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:02.861
Now, gather round.

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:05.894
Gather round.
Embrace one another.

01:00:06.236 --> 01:00:09.438
Gather round.
Embrace one another quickly.

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:10.736
Roy.

01:00:14.678 --> 01:00:17.079
Why do you stand aside
while the others practice?

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.878
"Practice?"

01:00:19.149 --> 01:00:21.584
That's not practicing.
That's group hugging.

01:00:21.585 --> 01:00:24.213
We should be busting in
on Casanova right now.

01:00:24.521 --> 01:00:28.981
He who questions training, only
trains himself at asking questions.

01:00:31.261 --> 01:00:32.660
What?

01:00:38.435 --> 01:00:40.736
Who was looking for
the pinking shears?

01:00:40.737 --> 01:00:41.871
Oh, that was me.

01:00:41.872 --> 01:00:46.536
Yes, work well on
your new costumes, my friends.

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:49.869
For when you care
for what is outside,

01:00:50.514 --> 01:00:53.278
what is inside cares for you.

01:00:53.783 --> 01:00:55.417
The clock is ticking here.

01:00:55.418 --> 01:00:59.021
Are we gonna sew dresses all day
or are we gonna rescue Amazing?

01:00:59.022 --> 01:01:00.723
I need a thimble.
Does anybody...

01:01:00.724 --> 01:01:02.091
Patience, my son.

01:01:02.092 --> 01:01:04.260
To summon your power for
the conflict to come,

01:01:04.261 --> 01:01:07.389
you must first have power
over that which conflicts you.

01:01:07.697 --> 01:01:11.327
Am I the only one who finds these
sayings just a little formulaic?

01:01:11.568 --> 01:01:14.203
"If you want to push something
down, you have to pull it up. "

01:01:14.204 --> 01:01:16.272
"If you want to go left,
you have to go right. "

01:01:16.273 --> 01:01:21.043
Your temper is very quick, but until
you learn to master your rage...

01:01:21.044 --> 01:01:23.536
Your rage will
become your master?

01:01:24.748 --> 01:01:26.482
That's what you
were gonna say, right?

01:01:26.483 --> 01:01:27.950
Right?

01:01:27.951 --> 01:01:29.248
Not necessarily.

01:01:29.886 --> 01:01:31.980
That's it. I'm out of here.

01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:35.891
Thanks for all the advice, Mr. Misterioso,
but it's time to get busy with it.

01:01:35.892 --> 01:01:37.059
Come on, Eddie.
Let's go.

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:38.127
No, Roy.

01:01:38.128 --> 01:01:39.595
I think he's getting results.

01:01:39.596 --> 01:01:41.463
Yeah, and the biggest one is
that we're all out of here.

01:01:41.464 --> 01:01:44.992
Come on, Jeff. Let's peel
some wheelies. Let's go.

01:01:45.468 --> 01:01:47.803
I don't want to leave
the Sphinx.

01:01:47.804 --> 01:01:49.738
Okay, how about
the rest of you?

01:01:49.739 --> 01:01:52.441
Do you want to play Suzie
Homemaker with Captain Conundrum

01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:54.536
or do you want
to be superheroes?

01:02:02.152 --> 01:02:06.180
Okay, I don't need a compass to
tell me which way the wind shines.

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:09.024
Roy, wait.
Let's talk about this.

01:02:09.025 --> 01:02:10.859
No, let's not talk about it!

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:13.262
You want to sit here, make Halloween
outfits with Little Red Riding Hood

01:02:13.263 --> 01:02:15.755
or you want to
take care of business?

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:21.834
Well, I guess from now on I
ride in a wolf pack of one.

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:32.081
We should go after him.

01:02:32.082 --> 01:02:34.216
He's okay. Just let him go. He's a baby.

01:02:34.217 --> 01:02:36.385
We've never gone
into battle without him.

01:02:36.386 --> 01:02:38.053
If you love him so much,
why don't you marry him?

01:02:38.054 --> 01:02:39.922
I don't know. Why don't you
marry him? Why don't you?

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:41.523
Why don't you?
Why don't you?

01:02:41.524 --> 01:02:43.492
Bowler, Shoveler, please!

01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:48.497
Sphinx, what wisdom can you give
us in this, our most clouded hour?

01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:50.193
Yeah, what do we do?

01:02:51.534 --> 01:02:54.069
The loss of manpower
can be replaced

01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:56.198
by the addition
of firepower.

01:02:58.942 --> 01:03:02.111
Well, I won't use guns. I've
been crystal clear about that.

01:03:02.112 --> 01:03:03.445
He won't even
use a knife.

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:06.015
You're not going to start
with that again, are you?

01:03:06.016 --> 01:03:08.007
Casanova will have
many weapons.

01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:12.911
To beat him, you will have to have
more than forks and flatulence.

01:03:17.293 --> 01:03:18.761
Heller.

01:03:26.236 --> 01:03:30.036
"Dr. A. Heller:
Weapons designer,

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:33.039
"innovator, inventor,
world changer. "

01:03:54.464 --> 01:03:56.932
Why does he live in a
deserted amusement park?

01:03:56.933 --> 01:03:58.992
Because he's
an eccentric genius.

01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:02.071
I'll take point. You two
flank. Let's triangulate.

01:04:02.072 --> 01:04:03.906
Equilateral or isosceles?

01:04:03.907 --> 01:04:04.999
Just go.

01:04:21.424 --> 01:04:23.825
Who would want
to rent a chicken?

01:04:25.895 --> 01:04:29.024
This is weird in here.
It's scary and weird.

01:04:40.477 --> 01:04:42.311
Oh, there's
another chicken.

01:04:42.312 --> 01:04:44.303
Crazy chicken world.

01:04:55.825 --> 01:04:57.156
Dr. Heller?

01:04:59.129 --> 01:05:00.790
We come in peace.

01:05:02.365 --> 01:05:03.632
Shovel Head?

01:05:03.633 --> 01:05:06.368
The Shoveler. Yes, sir.
We met at the old folks' home.

01:05:06.369 --> 01:05:09.430
Of course.
Fork Man?

01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:13.242
I'm the Spleen. If you want to know
what my power is, pull my finger.

01:05:13.243 --> 01:05:15.477
Please, don't!
Don't, sir. Don't.

01:05:15.478 --> 01:05:19.548
Dr. Heller, we're on a
mission. We've come for weapons.

01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:22.951
Shouldn't we see a diploma
or something first?

01:05:22.952 --> 01:05:26.684
You came to the right place,
baby. Step into my office.

01:05:30.493 --> 01:05:32.484
Where are your friends?

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:35.125
What friends?

01:05:35.799 --> 01:05:40.302
Your friends. I thought you
guys were in a club or something.

01:05:40.303 --> 01:05:42.905
You mean a team? A Super Team?

01:05:42.906 --> 01:05:44.006
Yeah.

01:05:44.007 --> 01:05:48.569
Apparently, it's now the
Super Sphinx Team or something.

01:05:48.845 --> 01:05:50.212
You had a falling out?

01:05:50.213 --> 01:05:51.647
Yeah, kind of.

01:05:54.751 --> 01:05:56.785
Is it okay if I just
have the coffee?

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:57.853
I'm not very hungry.

01:05:57.854 --> 01:05:59.117
Sure.

01:06:02.091 --> 01:06:03.320
Hey,

01:06:05.295 --> 01:06:07.388
what time do you get off work?

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:10.960
Half hour. Why?

01:06:12.101 --> 01:06:15.270
No reason. I was just thinking
maybe I could...

01:06:15.271 --> 01:06:17.706
It might be a good idea
if I walked you home.

01:06:17.707 --> 01:06:20.309
The city's been
real, real dangerous

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:22.335
since Amazing went M.I.A.

01:06:25.882 --> 01:06:28.083
I've been working on
some jujitsu moves that...

01:06:28.084 --> 01:06:32.254
Just probably be safer on
everybody's part if...

01:06:32.255 --> 01:06:37.318
Also, it would be great
to just walk you home.

01:06:39.462 --> 01:06:40.759
Sure.

01:06:45.702 --> 01:06:49.570
This will even things up
a little bit. What is it?

01:06:49.906 --> 01:06:51.139
Look at this!

01:06:52.275 --> 01:06:53.542
Don't point at me.

01:06:53.543 --> 01:06:56.308
You're gonna kill somebody.

01:06:56.513 --> 01:06:59.448
Listen, everything here
is nonlethal.

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:02.477
"Nonlethal"? What?

01:07:03.319 --> 01:07:05.420
I don't make anything
that's deadly.

01:07:05.421 --> 01:07:08.823
I see.
How delightfully eccentric,

01:07:09.058 --> 01:07:11.560
while, simultaneously, being
a complete waste of our time.

01:07:11.561 --> 01:07:13.462
No offense. Shall we?
Thank you, Doctor.

01:07:13.463 --> 01:07:14.529
I said good day.

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:15.731
See you, Doc.

01:07:15.732 --> 01:07:19.568
That is why, in general, a
mad scientist is less desirable

01:07:19.569 --> 01:07:22.334
than a garden-variety
scientist.

01:07:25.008 --> 01:07:26.475
Incoming!

01:07:31.247 --> 01:07:33.511
Look out! Out of the way! Watch out!

01:07:56.272 --> 01:07:58.263
Doc, you're a genius.

01:07:58.808 --> 01:08:00.435
A canned tornado, huh?

01:08:00.944 --> 01:08:03.879
Totally nonlethal,
but totally effective.

01:08:04.147 --> 01:08:05.948
What is this thing you were
handling before?

01:08:05.949 --> 01:08:07.516
That's a shrinker.

01:08:07.517 --> 01:08:10.452
How do you know?
Oh, a manual. Cool.

01:08:10.887 --> 01:08:14.523
That's a high-temperature
fabric adhesive liquid projector

01:08:14.524 --> 01:08:17.653
based on simple
dry-cleaning technology.

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:22.163
You aim that at a guy,
and I'll tell you something

01:08:22.165 --> 01:08:25.533
his clothes get so tight
he can't even breathe.

01:08:25.535 --> 01:08:27.069
I can trick that out
with a clam shell holster.

01:08:27.069 --> 01:08:29.237
It comes with
a leather carrying case.

01:08:29.238 --> 01:08:31.640
It's got a wad cutter
and a full warranty.

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:32.774
Nicely done.

01:08:32.774 --> 01:08:34.343
What do you call this?

01:08:34.344 --> 01:08:36.211
Careful, careful.
That's a blame-thrower.

01:08:36.212 --> 01:08:39.180
"A blamethrower"?
I'm sorry.

01:08:39.182 --> 01:08:41.216
Your bad attitude
is hurting this team!

01:08:41.216 --> 01:08:43.118
Stop spitting on me!
I already took a shower!

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:45.487
You need another shower
'cause you stink!

01:08:45.488 --> 01:08:47.089
Want me to get
that zit for you?

01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:48.457
I'm really shaking!

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:51.325
I'm sorry! I'm sorry
if I spit all the time!

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:56.932
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:08:56.933 --> 01:08:59.402
No, no, no. No.

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:03.738
Doctor, you are a genius.

01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:04.968
That's what the card says.

01:09:06.509 --> 01:09:09.671
I still want to be with them
when they go rescue Amazing.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:11.979
So why don't you just go back?

01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:14.282
No, I couldn't go back. I just
left this morning. That would be...

01:09:14.283 --> 01:09:15.484
This is my place.

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:16.816
That would be ridiculous.

01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:18.886
They're your friends.
They'll understand.

01:09:18.888 --> 01:09:21.990
It's clearly what
you want to do.

01:09:21.991 --> 01:09:26.261
That actually could work.
I'm Mr. Furious, right?

01:09:26.261 --> 01:09:28.229
I'm unpredictable.
I'm a loose cannon.

01:09:28.231 --> 01:09:30.432
I go storming off. Why
can't I come storming back?

01:09:30.433 --> 01:09:32.701
I mean, it's all in
how you play it, right?

01:09:32.702 --> 01:09:34.536
Or don't play it.

01:09:34.537 --> 01:09:39.100
Just go back, say you're sorry
and help them save Captain Amazing.

01:09:39.642 --> 01:09:42.944
You think there's a really
angry way I could say I'm sorry?

01:09:42.944 --> 01:09:44.613
Just 'cause
that's kind of my...

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:47.879
I gotta stick with the anger
thing 'cause people like that.

01:09:52.121 --> 01:09:54.681
Maybe people like you for
who you really are.

01:09:55.525 --> 01:09:56.958
You know?

01:09:58.861 --> 01:10:00.830
Okay, I'm gonna go.

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:08.364
You should go find
your friends.

01:10:21.284 --> 01:10:22.284
Good.

01:10:22.285 --> 01:10:26.221
Now, the three of you will be
like the eagle's claw.

01:10:26.456 --> 01:10:29.516
You will snatch up the hostage
and carry him to safety.

01:10:29.692 --> 01:10:34.653
We three scouts are like the eagle's
eye: Ever watchful for danger.

01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:36.998
Are you ready?

01:10:36.999 --> 01:10:38.200
Yes.
Ready.

01:10:38.201 --> 01:10:42.638
Then let operation Three-Eyed,
Three-Legged Eagle begin.

01:10:47.477 --> 01:10:48.677
Shotgun!

01:10:48.678 --> 01:10:50.612
I think not, my friend.

01:10:59.155 --> 01:11:01.021
Silly twit.

01:11:01.958 --> 01:11:03.551
Give me a second.

01:11:08.231 --> 01:11:09.331
Hey.

01:11:09.332 --> 01:11:10.356
What's up?

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.525
Not a lot.
What's up with you?

01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:14.693
Nothing much.

01:11:16.973 --> 01:11:19.307
Have you seen
my address book?

01:11:19.308 --> 01:11:20.776
No. What did it look like?

01:11:21.978 --> 01:11:26.313
It's denim. It says "Hang loose"
on it with a picture of a kitten.

01:11:27.483 --> 01:11:28.849
No.

01:11:31.154 --> 01:11:33.822
You should probably think
about where you saw it last.

01:11:33.823 --> 01:11:35.188
Right.

01:11:42.832 --> 01:11:44.925
I should probably...

01:11:47.570 --> 01:11:51.336
Eddie, there's something
I want to say, okay?

01:11:51.874 --> 01:11:55.310
I'm angry about being
left out of this mission,

01:11:55.678 --> 01:11:57.813
and I'm angry about what's
happening with this team,

01:11:57.848 --> 01:12:00.578
but I'm... I'm...

01:12:03.352 --> 01:12:05.287
Oh, boy.

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:09.520
Temperature rising.

01:12:10.927 --> 01:12:12.588
Vision blurring.

01:12:13.496 --> 01:12:16.231
Rage taking over.

01:12:16.232 --> 01:12:17.499
Roy, I got an idea.

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:18.533
Why don't you come with us?

01:12:18.534 --> 01:12:19.626
Okay.

01:12:20.036 --> 01:12:21.833
Rage subsiding.

01:12:23.339 --> 01:12:25.535
Pulse slowing.

01:12:26.509 --> 01:12:28.068
Anger fading.

01:12:31.848 --> 01:12:34.442
That was
quick thinking, Eddie.

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:40.387
I wouldn't want anyone
to get hurt.

01:13:09.085 --> 01:13:10.185
Drink, drink!

01:13:10.186 --> 01:13:11.278
Mazel tov!

01:13:16.826 --> 01:13:19.194
Right then. I'll go
and scout out a way in.

01:13:19.195 --> 01:13:20.495
What should the signal be?

01:13:20.496 --> 01:13:22.097
"Karee, karee, karoo. "

01:13:22.098 --> 01:13:24.532
No, no, what about,
"Whippoorwill, whippoorwill"?

01:13:24.533 --> 01:13:25.800
No. "Karee karoo. "

01:13:25.801 --> 01:13:26.791
Yes, but isn't that better?

01:13:26.969 --> 01:13:28.603
Not interested.

01:13:28.604 --> 01:13:30.698
Enough with the cuckoo!

01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:31.973
We have to find
an open window.

01:13:31.974 --> 01:13:33.174
That's what I just said.

01:13:33.175 --> 01:13:35.041
Go, go!

01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:42.748
Does everyone have a drink?

01:13:43.319 --> 01:13:44.853
Yes, we all do!

01:13:44.854 --> 01:13:45.912
You're all good?

01:13:46.222 --> 01:13:49.385
Good. Well, it is wonderful
in my heart

01:13:50.493 --> 01:13:54.062
to see so many
familiar faces once again.

01:13:54.063 --> 01:13:57.055
The Susies,
assassins from the East.

01:13:59.368 --> 01:14:03.705
The Suits, downsizing all
those who dare oppose them.

01:14:03.706 --> 01:14:07.108
And the Furriers,
always dressed to kill.

01:14:11.714 --> 01:14:17.052
And the Frat Boys, still on
probation for lethal hazing.

01:14:17.053 --> 01:14:18.119
Phi Zeta!

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:21.454
And, of course,
the Not So Goody Mob,

01:14:22.591 --> 01:14:24.993
putting the rhyme into crime!

01:14:24.994 --> 01:14:27.162
The pleasure's all mine,
Frankenstein.

01:14:27.163 --> 01:14:30.198
We're about to perpetrate some
evil on these Champion City people.

01:14:30.199 --> 01:14:32.701
Rapping, snapping, capping.

01:14:32.702 --> 01:14:37.435
Tonight, we are having quite
a party, a surprise party.

01:14:38.507 --> 01:14:40.999
I have a little something
up my sleeve,

01:14:41.277 --> 01:14:44.804
and I'm not just talking about
the wart on my elbow.

01:14:50.353 --> 01:14:53.982
I have created
a beautiful machine

01:14:54.256 --> 01:14:57.454
that is going to encourage
our fellow citizens,

01:14:57.994 --> 01:15:00.729
to share my vision

01:15:00.730 --> 01:15:02.330
of the world!

01:15:03.966 --> 01:15:05.627
Can you dig it?

01:15:07.903 --> 01:15:09.997
What about Captain Amazing?

01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:14.440
That is an excellent
question, Big Tobacco.

01:15:15.077 --> 01:15:19.344
What are we gonna do about the greatest
superhero Champion City has ever known?

01:15:19.949 --> 01:15:24.477
For the answer, I want
you all to walk this way.

01:15:24.887 --> 01:15:27.481
Dude, can we bring
the brewskis?

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:31.793
Yes, of course. You may
absolutely bring the brewskis.

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:42.667
Things look
pretty quiet to me.

01:15:47.143 --> 01:15:49.144
Invisible Boy,
did you just let one go?

01:15:49.145 --> 01:15:50.645
No, that wasn't me.

01:15:50.646 --> 01:15:51.807
Well, it wasn't me.

01:15:57.953 --> 01:16:00.115
Don't run! He'll shoot!

01:16:09.865 --> 01:16:12.061
Is he doing what
I think he's doing?

01:16:17.039 --> 01:16:18.905
Just go with it.

01:16:29.552 --> 01:16:30.819
Can anybody see anything?

01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:31.986
Hey!

01:16:31.987 --> 01:16:33.755
Who said, "Hey"?
Not me.

01:16:33.756 --> 01:16:36.623
Eddie, you don't
have to say, "Not me," okay?

01:16:36.959 --> 01:16:38.626
If someone says, "Who?"
And you say...

01:16:38.627 --> 01:16:40.391
Hey, morons,
over here.

01:16:40.996 --> 01:16:43.022
It's Captain Amazing!

01:16:43.899 --> 01:16:45.433
We've been looking for you.

01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:47.926
Turn on the light switch
behind you.

01:16:50.039 --> 01:16:54.999
My, my. Well, well.
We meet again, Captain?

01:16:55.344 --> 01:16:56.578
We're here
to rescue you.

01:16:56.579 --> 01:16:57.705
Yeah.

01:16:58.914 --> 01:17:02.083
I'm Blue Raja. Do you recall
me? Master of silverware.

01:17:02.084 --> 01:17:04.919
You told me to keep up the good
work after the Red Eye skirmish.

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:08.356
I meet so many people in
this business, but I think so.

01:17:08.357 --> 01:17:11.593
Could you two locate the master
ignition switch on the main console?

01:17:11.594 --> 01:17:13.728
Maybe you could open that up?

01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:15.697
Have you out in two shakes
of a lamb's tail.

01:17:15.865 --> 01:17:17.165
Frightfully uncomfortable. Great.

01:17:17.166 --> 01:17:18.433
How does this work?

01:17:18.434 --> 01:17:20.068
I've seen one of these things.

01:17:20.069 --> 01:17:22.871
You've got to push
this thing in and twist it.

01:17:22.872 --> 01:17:24.139
Don't force it!

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:25.640
She's right,
my little friend.

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:28.610
This contraption is, in fact,
a weapon of mass destruction.

01:17:28.611 --> 01:17:30.912
Casanova plans to turn it
against the city at midnight.

01:17:30.913 --> 01:17:32.881
Something's happening.

01:17:33.349 --> 01:17:38.119
Okay, very good. On the wall to your left
you should see two toggles side-by-side.

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:41.249
"Toggles"? What do you mean?
You talking about switches?

01:17:41.857 --> 01:17:42.991
I see them, Captain.

01:17:42.992 --> 01:17:44.125
Thank you.

01:17:44.126 --> 01:17:45.660
Flip the first toggle.

01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:46.719
Flipping.

01:17:49.064 --> 01:17:50.298
Excellent work.

01:17:50.299 --> 01:17:51.366
Now, flip the...

01:17:51.367 --> 01:17:52.467
Jolly good work, team!

01:17:52.468 --> 01:17:55.528
Could you just
stay over there, please?

01:17:55.804 --> 01:17:57.431
Of course.

01:18:00.209 --> 01:18:01.472
Sorry.

01:18:02.011 --> 01:18:04.112
Now flip the second toggle.

01:18:04.113 --> 01:18:05.513
Do as he says.

01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:07.539
The man knows
what of he speaks.

01:18:08.017 --> 01:18:10.351
I'm just gonna
ask you directly:

01:18:10.352 --> 01:18:12.320
Do you know billionaire
Lance Hunt?

01:18:12.321 --> 01:18:13.846
It's me.

01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:17.392
No, I'm kidding with you.
I've always wanted to do that.

01:18:17.393 --> 01:18:18.526
What's next?

01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:20.461
I just told you,
flip the second toggle.

01:18:20.829 --> 01:18:22.163
Again?

01:18:22.164 --> 01:18:23.222
What do you mean?

01:18:24.166 --> 01:18:25.500
Flip the toggle twice?

01:18:25.501 --> 01:18:26.668
No, no, no.

01:18:26.669 --> 01:18:29.900
Don't do that. Just flip it
again now, one time. Flip it.

01:18:30.406 --> 01:18:32.040
Does he understand
what I'm asking?

01:18:32.041 --> 01:18:36.477
Hold on a second. Exactly how
many toggle flips in total,

01:18:36.478 --> 01:18:38.470
are involved
in this procedure?

01:18:38.614 --> 01:18:42.380
I just... It's... Seven!

01:18:42.985 --> 01:18:44.485
Seven?
Flip it!

01:18:44.486 --> 01:18:45.753
Seven?

01:18:45.754 --> 01:18:47.689
Everybody, hold the phone.

01:18:47.690 --> 01:18:51.626
You phrased that incorrectly. We need
to know how many toggle flips are needed,

01:18:51.627 --> 01:18:54.762
not counting the gratuitous
toggle flip you may have asked for

01:18:54.763 --> 01:18:55.830
in a moment of panic.

01:18:55.831 --> 01:18:56.764
Flip it!

01:18:57.399 --> 01:18:59.033
Could we just start again?

01:18:59.034 --> 01:19:01.069
Is there some sort of
reset button on this thing?

01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:03.638
No, you little freak, there's
no button for resetting.

01:19:03.639 --> 01:19:05.540
Flip the switch, lady.
Don't stare at me.

01:19:05.541 --> 01:19:07.041
Lift your left arm.
Flip it, you moron!

01:19:07.042 --> 01:19:08.376
You're a moron!

01:19:08.377 --> 01:19:09.477
I am not a moron.

01:19:09.478 --> 01:19:11.746
Do not call her a moron.
That's not cool.

01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:13.448
I will do it!

01:19:13.449 --> 01:19:15.149
Flip the switch, lady!
Don't look at me like that!

01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:16.948
It's this one, yes?

01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:20.411
Wrong switch.

01:19:38.207 --> 01:19:40.942
Everybody heard me say
"reset button," right?

01:19:40.943 --> 01:19:43.810
Oh, my God,
we killed him.

01:19:44.213 --> 01:19:46.613
What do you mean "we"?
I was right here.

01:20:01.163 --> 01:20:03.996
I'm gonna check his pulse.

01:20:09.305 --> 01:20:11.339
I don't think
he's gonna pull through.

01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:13.832
Somebody's coming.
We gotta get outta here.

01:20:14.209 --> 01:20:16.906
Everybody should just keep
holding their horses.

01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:20.649
Go, go, go.

01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:27.722
What the hell, man?

01:20:35.197 --> 01:20:36.597
This sucker's dead.

01:20:36.598 --> 01:20:38.396
What happened to him?

01:20:39.702 --> 01:20:44.196
As you can see,
I have taken Captain Amazing

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:46.608
out of the picture.

01:20:47.543 --> 01:20:49.704
It's time for us to rule.

01:20:52.614 --> 01:20:56.317
Tonight at midnight, I'm
going to do to Champion City

01:20:56.318 --> 01:20:58.844
what I have done
to its greatest superhero.

01:20:59.755 --> 01:21:04.022
And there'll still be time
to go up, get down and boogie.

01:21:05.627 --> 01:21:07.128
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

01:21:07.129 --> 01:21:08.858
Where's
Captain Amazing?

01:21:09.431 --> 01:21:10.965
There's been
a bit of a cock-up.

01:21:10.966 --> 01:21:14.425
Guys, I think we got a little
bigger fish to fry right now.

01:21:15.137 --> 01:21:17.238
What the hell was
that machine in there?

01:21:17.239 --> 01:21:19.901
I don't know. But I know
where we can go to find out.

01:21:26.081 --> 01:21:28.709
The vermin are back, Tony.

01:21:30.119 --> 01:21:33.247
Vermin should be
exterminated, Casanova.

01:21:34.690 --> 01:21:38.752
A fish fork is no match
for my machine!

01:21:40.162 --> 01:21:42.995
But I think we should take out
some insurance.

01:21:44.032 --> 01:21:45.800
Don't you think?

01:21:45.801 --> 01:21:47.635
It's
a psychofrakulator.

01:21:47.636 --> 01:21:51.973
It creates a cloud of radically
fluctuating free-deviant chaotrons

01:21:51.974 --> 01:21:53.941
which penetrate
the synaptic relays.

01:21:53.942 --> 01:21:57.208
It's concatenated with a
synchronous transport switch

01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:00.544
that creates
a virtual tributary.

01:22:01.483 --> 01:22:04.452
It's focused onto
a biobolic reflector.

01:22:04.453 --> 01:22:08.856
And what happens is that
hallucinations become reality

01:22:09.625 --> 01:22:11.759
and the brain is literally
fried from within.

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:12.827
Where would you get
something like that?

01:22:12.828 --> 01:22:13.895
I don't know.

01:22:13.896 --> 01:22:15.930
They used to say
it couldn't be built.

01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:19.734
The equations were so complex that
most of the scientists who worked on it

01:22:19.735 --> 01:22:21.202
wound up in the insane asylum.

01:22:21.203 --> 01:22:24.605
Which is where Casanova's been
hanging for the last 20 years.

01:22:24.807 --> 01:22:27.441
If he turned that thing on the city,
it'll waste everything in sight.

01:22:27.442 --> 01:22:28.643
Not "if. " When.

01:22:28.644 --> 01:22:29.811
We need Captain Amazing.

01:22:29.812 --> 01:22:32.079
Yes, but, unfortunately,
we just killed him.

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:34.276
Unfortunately,
you killed him.

01:22:34.583 --> 01:22:36.184
Just because you're having
problems at home

01:22:36.185 --> 01:22:37.652
don't mean you can go around
killing people.

01:22:37.653 --> 01:22:42.113
"Oh, sorry. Mummy. I'm
English. I didn't mean it. "

01:22:42.357 --> 01:22:45.126
K- I-L-L-E-D.
You killed him.

01:22:45.127 --> 01:22:47.662
You killed him. You did. You were
the one who flicked the switch.

01:22:47.663 --> 01:22:50.792
It's the same difference.
He's still dead.

01:22:51.533 --> 01:22:52.667
You did kind of...

01:22:52.668 --> 01:22:53.862
Sphinx!

01:22:56.238 --> 01:22:58.940
What in heaven's name
do we do?

01:22:58.941 --> 01:23:00.408
Sometimes,

01:23:00.776 --> 01:23:04.974
the true hero is the one
with the courage to run away.

01:23:05.447 --> 01:23:07.281
I like the way
this man thinks.

01:23:07.282 --> 01:23:08.443
Let's run.

01:23:09.384 --> 01:23:10.551
We can't run.

01:23:10.552 --> 01:23:13.351
Oh, yes. It's been
established that we can run.

01:23:15.390 --> 01:23:19.725
This is egg salad loaded with cholesterol.
The wife won't even let me touch it.

01:23:20.863 --> 01:23:25.300
Hardly seems to matter now. 'Cause
chances are, we're already dead.

01:23:26.201 --> 01:23:27.735
Amazing is gone.

01:23:27.736 --> 01:23:30.771
There's no use waiting for the
cavalry, because as of this moment,

01:23:30.772 --> 01:23:32.740
the cavalry is us.

01:23:32.741 --> 01:23:34.709
Yeah, but I don't
wanna get frakulated.

01:23:34.710 --> 01:23:36.210
Psychofrakulated.

01:23:36.211 --> 01:23:37.512
We still get frakulated.

01:23:37.513 --> 01:23:39.247
This is our fight,
whether we like it or not.

01:23:39.248 --> 01:23:40.815
Just we few.

01:23:40.816 --> 01:23:43.046
We're not your
classic superheroes.

01:23:43.485 --> 01:23:46.250
We're not the favorites.
We're the other guys.

01:23:46.755 --> 01:23:49.782
We're the guys nobody
ever bets on.

01:23:51.293 --> 01:23:53.027
But I tell you what I think.

01:23:53.028 --> 01:23:56.828
You and that ball of yours have an
appointment that you've gotta keep.

01:23:57.232 --> 01:23:59.997
Invisible Boy, I think
it's time you were seen.

01:24:00.602 --> 01:24:02.696
Sphinx, you have
trained us well.

01:24:03.305 --> 01:24:07.575
Dr. Heller, you might just
have given us the edge we need.

01:24:07.576 --> 01:24:10.636
Spleen, I don't wanna
stand behind you.

01:24:10.946 --> 01:24:13.176
But I'll fight beside you
with pride.

01:24:13.649 --> 01:24:16.209
Jeff, you've got
a rare and beautiful gift.

01:24:16.952 --> 01:24:19.717
The city needs you
tonight. And, Roy,

01:24:20.088 --> 01:24:21.689
in all the years
I've known you,

01:24:21.690 --> 01:24:24.182
I've never seen you
walk away from a fight.

01:24:24.459 --> 01:24:26.694
Why, you lifted
a city bus once, man.

01:24:26.695 --> 01:24:29.926
I think you've got what it
takes to handle Casanova.

01:24:31.099 --> 01:24:33.659
We're all in over our
heads, and we know it.

01:24:33.869 --> 01:24:37.038
But if we take on this fight,
those of us who survive it

01:24:37.039 --> 01:24:41.442
will forever after show our scars
with pride and say, "That's right.

01:24:41.810 --> 01:24:44.677
"I was there.
I fought the good fight. "

01:24:45.213 --> 01:24:46.747
So, what do you say?

01:24:46.748 --> 01:24:51.743
Do we all gather together and
go kick some Casanova butt,

01:24:52.487 --> 01:24:55.156
or do I eat this sandwich?

01:24:55.157 --> 01:24:58.752
I say, what the fork.
Let's do it.

01:25:01.196 --> 01:25:02.697
If we're gonna bust
into that mansion,

01:25:02.698 --> 01:25:04.332
you're gonna need more than
a station wagon.

01:25:04.333 --> 01:25:06.367
At the auto yard, there's this
old Herkimer battle jitney.

01:25:06.368 --> 01:25:07.702
Sally's always telling me
to junk it.

01:25:07.703 --> 01:25:10.204
Wait. You have
a Herkimer battle jitney?

01:25:10.205 --> 01:25:13.374
That's the finest non-lethal
military vehicle ever made.

01:25:13.375 --> 01:25:16.210
All right, we'll meet at the
junkyard. We'll go from there.

01:25:16.211 --> 01:25:18.578
I shall need more forks,
I'm afraid.

01:25:19.081 --> 01:25:21.615
Those of you with loved ones,
say good-bye before we go.

01:25:21.616 --> 01:25:23.585
You may not get
another chance.

01:25:29.825 --> 01:25:31.759
Sei gesund.

01:25:41.303 --> 01:25:42.668
Hey, Mom.

01:25:43.705 --> 01:25:45.605
Jeffrey, what are you doing?

01:25:45.941 --> 01:25:48.068
I was just...

01:25:55.884 --> 01:25:57.579
I'm a superhero, Mother.

01:25:58.186 --> 01:25:59.820
A superhero?

01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:02.056
An effete British superhero,
to be precise.

01:26:02.057 --> 01:26:05.186
I am pilfering your tableware
because I hurl it.

01:26:05.594 --> 01:26:09.730
I hurl it with a deadly accuracy.
The Blue Raja is my name.

01:26:09.731 --> 01:26:12.733
Yes, I know. I don't wear much blue,
and I speak in a British accent.

01:26:12.734 --> 01:26:14.702
But if you know your history, it
really does make perfect sense.

01:26:14.703 --> 01:26:18.339
The point is, your boy's a
limey fork-flinger, Mother.

01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:21.208
Hard cheese to swallow,
but there it is.

01:26:21.209 --> 01:26:23.371
What will the bridge
club think?

01:26:27.616 --> 01:26:29.675
You need more forks?

01:26:33.455 --> 01:26:36.516
These belonged to your
great-great grandmother.

01:26:36.825 --> 01:26:39.226
I was saving these
for your wedding day.

01:26:39.227 --> 01:26:44.222
But from the looks of it, that
day, it's probably a long way off.

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:48.463
Mom, you're taking this
incredibly well.

01:26:49.037 --> 01:26:51.305
I've always known
you were special,

01:26:51.306 --> 01:26:55.209
but I just never realized
how special.

01:27:00.816 --> 01:27:02.340
I'd better get going.

01:27:03.151 --> 01:27:04.452
I've got a city to save.

01:27:04.453 --> 01:27:06.182
Jeffrey?
Yeah?

01:27:06.354 --> 01:27:07.913
Do the accent.

01:27:10.358 --> 01:27:13.961
I'd love to stay and chitchat,
but I fear I must away with me.

01:27:13.962 --> 01:27:17.164
Our metropolis is in
the clutches of madmen.

01:27:17.165 --> 01:27:19.500
Jeffrey? Cheerio.

01:27:19.501 --> 01:27:20.668
I really should get going.

01:27:20.669 --> 01:27:22.034
Okay.

01:27:25.307 --> 01:27:27.241
Thanks, Ma.

01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:39.312
I said I was gonna leave
you, and I meant it.

01:27:40.822 --> 01:27:44.782
The city's in peril, Lucille.
We're the best hope they've got.

01:27:45.527 --> 01:27:48.087
Eddie, please don't start.

01:27:48.563 --> 01:27:50.598
I don't expect you
to believe me.

01:27:50.599 --> 01:27:54.262
I just came by
to tell you that I love you.

01:27:55.036 --> 01:27:56.766
Tell the kids I love them.

01:27:57.272 --> 01:28:00.435
And now, good-bye.

01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:02.600
Good-bye, Eddie.

01:28:04.079 --> 01:28:06.241
I won't be here
when you come home.

01:28:06.715 --> 01:28:08.883
Well, that's a chance
I'm gonna have to take.

01:28:08.884 --> 01:28:12.684
Otherwise, there may not be
a home to come back to.

01:28:22.631 --> 01:28:24.360
Wish me luck.

01:28:32.707 --> 01:28:34.942
Hi.

01:28:34.943 --> 01:28:35.976
You okay?

01:28:35.977 --> 01:28:38.212
I wanted to say
I had a great time tonight.

01:28:38.213 --> 01:28:40.381
And you were
really nice to me.

01:28:40.382 --> 01:28:43.918
And I would love to,
to ask you out sometime.

01:28:43.919 --> 01:28:47.388
But if I don't call you, I want
you to know it's because I'm dead.

01:28:47.389 --> 01:28:50.624
Me and my team, we're gonna
take on Casanova Frankenstein.

01:28:50.625 --> 01:28:53.294
And it's pretty much
a suicide mission.

01:28:53.295 --> 01:28:57.527
So, if there is anything that
you wanna say to me,

01:28:57.799 --> 01:29:01.569
now would probably be a good
time to say it, just 'cause...

01:29:01.570 --> 01:29:03.637
Yeah, I got
a question for you.

01:29:03.638 --> 01:29:04.905
Cool. Kick it.

01:29:04.906 --> 01:29:06.602
What's your name?

01:29:06.741 --> 01:29:09.677
Do you mean my secret
identity? 'Cause I couldn't.

01:29:09.678 --> 01:29:12.408
No, I just,
you know, mean your name.

01:29:13.748 --> 01:29:15.239
My name.

01:29:17.152 --> 01:29:18.346
Okay.

01:29:20.488 --> 01:29:23.515
It's Phoenix.

01:29:24.759 --> 01:29:27.024
Phoenix Dark.

01:29:28.063 --> 01:29:30.361
Dirk. Phoenix...

01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:32.700
Dark-Dirk.

01:29:32.701 --> 01:29:36.103
It was...
I was christened Dirk Steele,

01:29:36.104 --> 01:29:37.371
and I changed it to Phoenix.

01:29:37.372 --> 01:29:39.500
Forget about it.
It's okay.

01:29:46.414 --> 01:29:47.848
It's Roy.

01:29:49.517 --> 01:29:51.645
That's my name.
My name is...

01:29:53.054 --> 01:29:55.489
My real name is Roy.

01:30:15.043 --> 01:30:17.637
Just be Roy.

01:30:27.589 --> 01:30:31.525
Roy, the Roy. Yes, I'm Roy.

01:30:31.526 --> 01:30:33.193
Who is Roy? Roy is who?

01:30:33.194 --> 01:30:35.062
He's freaking out, man.

01:30:35.063 --> 01:30:37.798
Where's the guy who pretends
not to be Roy?

01:30:37.799 --> 01:30:39.967
We've had quite enough
of that. Just stop it.

01:30:39.968 --> 01:30:42.970
Just snap out of it.
We're tired of it.

01:30:42.971 --> 01:30:47.431
I'm a wannabe. A true wannabe,
in the worst sense of the...

01:30:47.642 --> 01:30:49.677
You guys are gonna have to go
fight this battle without me.

01:30:49.678 --> 01:30:52.179
You start doubting your
super powers, you are shafted.

01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:55.683
If I had any super powers, I guess
I would be in trouble, but I don't.

01:30:55.684 --> 01:30:57.311
What do I do?
I go...

01:30:58.687 --> 01:31:01.121
What are you talking about?
You lifted a bus once.

01:31:01.122 --> 01:31:03.991
Precisely.
That story's legendary.

01:31:03.992 --> 01:31:07.087
It was really more of a push,
really, than a lift.

01:31:07.295 --> 01:31:10.026
That still takes incredible
superhuman strength.

01:31:10.398 --> 01:31:12.833
It does, to push
an entire bus out the way.

01:31:12.834 --> 01:31:15.903
Actually, the driver kind of
had his foot on the accelerator,

01:31:15.904 --> 01:31:18.105
just in the beginning, just to get
it going, then it actually was me.

01:31:18.106 --> 01:31:20.234
But he kind of...

01:31:22.844 --> 01:31:24.511
Oh, shit.

01:31:28.650 --> 01:31:30.777
Excuse me.

01:31:33.254 --> 01:31:36.890
It's a process which results in
an accelerated flow of electrons

01:31:36.891 --> 01:31:39.059
that creates such
a powerful magnetic force.

01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:41.620
This is basically
like a huge electromagnet.

01:31:41.796 --> 01:31:44.925
Actually, it's
an electro-nuclear-magnet.

01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:46.667
It's the next
inevitable phase.

01:31:46.668 --> 01:31:49.169
Vis, can you
close up those jockey boxes?

01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:50.304
Right on it.

01:31:50.305 --> 01:31:53.798
Let's get suited up.
We're out of here in five.

01:31:58.279 --> 01:31:59.679
It's time.

01:32:01.783 --> 01:32:03.182
Let's go.

01:32:55.036 --> 01:32:56.236
Shotgun!

01:32:56.237 --> 01:32:57.871
I've already called it,
didn't I?

01:32:57.872 --> 01:32:59.006
Have a seat, my friend.

01:32:59.007 --> 01:33:00.338
Everybody ready?

01:33:00.842 --> 01:33:02.743
And we have lift-off.

01:33:02.744 --> 01:33:04.678
May the forks
be with us.

01:33:09.684 --> 01:33:11.618
I'm sorry.
Too much throttle.

01:33:11.619 --> 01:33:13.287
That's cool.
I'm just gonna go.

01:33:13.288 --> 01:33:14.721
Yo, sit down!

01:33:14.722 --> 01:33:16.020
All right,
here we go.

01:33:30.338 --> 01:33:32.102
Vaya con Dios.

01:33:36.511 --> 01:33:38.545
Somebody do something.
We need him.

01:33:38.546 --> 01:33:41.148
Let's do this.
You're a very furious man.

01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:43.083
Do you understand that?
No.

01:33:43.084 --> 01:33:46.286
You got a lot to be furious
about, and I'll tell you why.

01:33:46.287 --> 01:33:50.491
You're not well-liked. You're
abrasive and off-putting.

01:33:50.492 --> 01:33:52.860
You try and say pithy things,
but your wit is a hindrance,

01:33:52.861 --> 01:33:54.862
and so therefore,
nothing is provocative.

01:33:54.863 --> 01:33:57.965
It's just mixed metaphors. Now,
doesn't that make you angry?

01:33:57.966 --> 01:33:59.933
Does it infuriate you?
No.

01:33:59.934 --> 01:34:02.961
It should. Are you angry? Come on, man!

01:34:03.171 --> 01:34:05.239
Your penmanship is atrocious.

01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:07.174
You dress
like a male prostitute.

01:34:12.313 --> 01:34:15.545
Get real! I have
no powers whatsoever.

01:34:15.917 --> 01:34:18.519
If he has no powers,
maybe I've got no powers.

01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:20.287
Maybe I can't turn
invisible at all.

01:34:20.288 --> 01:34:22.089
Do not go there,
my son.

01:34:22.090 --> 01:34:25.058
When you doubt your powers,
you give power to your doubts.

01:34:25.059 --> 01:34:29.196
I don't mean to be alarmist,
but it's half 11:00 already.

01:34:29.197 --> 01:34:31.765
Thirty minutes till Casanova
blows up the city.

01:34:31.766 --> 01:34:35.896
Listen. We've got
a blind date with destiny.

01:34:37.438 --> 01:34:40.374
And it looks like
she's ordered the lobster.

01:34:43.778 --> 01:34:45.769
We're gonna ram the gate!

01:35:03.698 --> 01:35:07.396
What do you think? Should we
knock or just let ourselves in?

01:35:23.651 --> 01:35:25.210
Hit the ground!

01:35:41.970 --> 01:35:43.733
They're shooting!

01:36:00.521 --> 01:36:03.616
I hope this magnet
thing works.

01:36:17.405 --> 01:36:19.874
It's working.

01:36:30.451 --> 01:36:31.976
Go! Go!

01:36:34.422 --> 01:36:37.119
Everybody, into
the disco room.

01:36:40.862 --> 01:36:44.059
Everyone, through here.
Keep moving.

01:36:44.699 --> 01:36:46.895
Focus, people. Focus.
Let's go.

01:36:53.474 --> 01:36:54.806
Hello?

01:37:03.251 --> 01:37:04.514
Wait!

01:37:13.094 --> 01:37:14.892
Laser eye.

01:37:26.541 --> 01:37:28.709
I knew I should have brought
my large pie server.

01:37:28.710 --> 01:37:31.770
If we can't get through that
door, this battle is over.

01:37:35.917 --> 01:37:39.080
This is it. My time has come.

01:37:40.488 --> 01:37:43.253
What are you
talking about?

01:37:43.624 --> 01:37:45.425
Wait. Invisible Boy.

01:37:45.426 --> 01:37:46.593
I wouldn't do that, if...

01:37:46.594 --> 01:37:48.328
Come back here.
You'll be cremated.

01:37:48.329 --> 01:37:49.863
It's all about me now.

01:37:49.864 --> 01:37:51.732
I'm the only one
that can save us.

01:37:51.733 --> 01:37:52.866
He's right.

01:37:52.867 --> 01:37:54.334
Good luck, son.

01:37:54.335 --> 01:37:55.535
Nobody look at me.

01:37:55.536 --> 01:37:58.205
Don't look at him,
or it won't work.

01:37:58.206 --> 01:37:59.799
I am transparent.

01:38:00.274 --> 01:38:03.506
I am like the window.
I am see-through.

01:38:03.778 --> 01:38:05.576
I'm like Saran Wrap.

01:38:15.590 --> 01:38:18.923
I did it! I'm invisible!
I really do have super powers.

01:38:19.327 --> 01:38:21.090
Can you see me?

01:38:21.329 --> 01:38:22.990
Yes.

01:38:24.165 --> 01:38:25.999
Two hands there, son.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:30.267
Maybe you should put some shorts
on if you wanna keep fighting evil.

01:38:31.239 --> 01:38:34.174
Furriers, you will stay here
and delay the attackers.

01:38:34.175 --> 01:38:39.279
Not So Goody Mob, fight from behind.
The rest of you, into the atrium.

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:42.181
And spread yourself out
for a second wave of attack.

01:38:53.427 --> 01:38:55.794
The door. Door.

01:38:55.930 --> 01:39:00.094
On three. One, two, three.

01:39:14.182 --> 01:39:15.615
Shrink them.

01:39:28.729 --> 01:39:32.894
I say, they've gone from
junior to missy petite.

01:39:34.202 --> 01:39:36.727
Now that's a wedgie
she won't soon forget.

01:39:37.438 --> 01:39:40.465
My pants feel like
they're shrinking too.

01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:47.948
This way!

01:39:47.949 --> 01:39:49.177
Look out!

01:39:54.589 --> 01:39:56.056
I got a bone to pick with you.

01:39:56.057 --> 01:39:58.758
Hold it, Little Daddy.

01:39:58.759 --> 01:40:01.354
You know what?
Y'all make me sick.

01:40:10.705 --> 01:40:13.401
Give me that gun.

01:40:16.744 --> 01:40:18.011
I got them.

01:40:18.012 --> 01:40:19.036
Disco forever!

01:40:19.413 --> 01:40:21.882
Invisible Boy, Spleen.
Susies.

01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:14.859
Dig this, Shovel Man.

01:41:22.843 --> 01:41:24.477
Duck! It's the Susies!

01:41:24.478 --> 01:41:25.812
Grab the gun.

01:41:25.813 --> 01:41:26.803
It's stuck.

01:41:27.615 --> 01:41:29.049
Coast clear?

01:41:29.050 --> 01:41:30.745
Shoot anyway.

01:41:33.621 --> 01:41:34.854
I'm scared.

01:41:34.855 --> 01:41:36.323
No, you're not scared.
Be strong.

01:41:36.324 --> 01:41:39.059
Say it with me
"I ain't scared of no Susies. "

01:41:39.060 --> 01:41:40.160
I am scared of the Susies.

01:41:40.161 --> 01:41:41.394
Say "I'm not scared
of no Susies. "

01:41:41.395 --> 01:41:43.364
Come on. You ready?

01:41:43.864 --> 01:41:45.389
Let's go!

01:41:53.541 --> 01:41:55.771
Dive! Dive!

01:42:06.687 --> 01:42:08.280
I'm hit!

01:42:08.422 --> 01:42:09.489
Where?

01:42:09.490 --> 01:42:11.691
I'm hit! Medic!
Medic! Man down!

01:42:11.692 --> 01:42:13.960
Man down! I can't feel my ass. What?

01:42:13.961 --> 01:42:15.962
I can't feel my ass.
What?

01:42:15.963 --> 01:42:17.364
Your powers still work?

01:42:17.365 --> 01:42:20.266
My powers?
Weapons check.

01:42:22.036 --> 01:42:24.337
Fire in the hole! Pull!

01:42:28.909 --> 01:42:30.241
It'll do.

01:42:30.845 --> 01:42:34.508
Go check on Spleen, okay?
Okay. All right.

01:42:37.852 --> 01:42:39.419
You ought to run, Tony P.

01:42:39.420 --> 01:42:41.821
You can't hurt me,
Baby Bowler.

01:42:43.124 --> 01:42:44.887
'Cause I'm protected

01:42:46.694 --> 01:42:50.494
by the god of hair care.

01:42:51.265 --> 01:42:53.666
And it's time to send you
back to your daddy.

01:42:53.667 --> 01:42:54.868
You killed my father.

01:42:54.869 --> 01:42:57.338
That's right.
'Cause I'm a killer.

01:42:57.538 --> 01:43:00.974
And you're not.
Let's face it, kid.

01:43:00.975 --> 01:43:03.137
You don't have
the guts to kill me.

01:43:03.444 --> 01:43:06.713
You're right. I don't
have the guts to kill you.

01:43:06.714 --> 01:43:09.683
Because I'm better than you.
Yeah, that's right.

01:43:09.984 --> 01:43:11.383
A lot better.

01:43:12.386 --> 01:43:16.186
You know, I may even find the
courage to forgive you someday.

01:43:25.199 --> 01:43:29.295
Carmine, on the other hand, feels
differently than I do about forgiveness.

01:43:31.439 --> 01:43:34.641
Now I'm going back to graduate
school. That was the agreement.

01:43:34.642 --> 01:43:37.610
We're doing it. We're winning.
We're gonna pull this off.

01:43:37.611 --> 01:43:39.841
I wouldn't be so sure
about that.

01:43:40.581 --> 01:43:44.484
Tell your funny-looking friends to
put down their weapons, Mr. Furious.

01:43:44.485 --> 01:43:47.020
Just get out of here. He's
crazy. Save yourselves.

01:43:47.021 --> 01:43:51.322
Put them down or I will slash your
girlfriend's pretty little throat.

01:43:51.692 --> 01:43:54.218
Eddie, Jeff, do what he says.

01:43:58.866 --> 01:44:00.595
Thank you.

01:44:00.935 --> 01:44:04.803
It's so easy to get the best of
people when they care about each other.

01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:08.400
Which is why evil
will always have the edge.

01:44:08.876 --> 01:44:12.505
You good guys are always
so bound by the rules.

01:44:19.453 --> 01:44:22.047
You see, I kill my own men.

01:44:28.496 --> 01:44:30.430
And lucky me.

01:44:30.965 --> 01:44:32.899
I get the girl.

01:44:33.868 --> 01:44:36.064
No!

01:45:02.696 --> 01:45:07.566
Don't worry. It will all
be over so very quickly.

01:45:12.006 --> 01:45:13.339
What are you doing?

01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:16.009
They must have ripped the "Q"
section out of my dictionary,

01:45:16.010 --> 01:45:19.275
'cause I don't know the
meaning of the word "quit. "

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:36.255
You want
a little fisticuffs? Okay.

01:45:39.967 --> 01:45:41.628
Get him, Roy.

01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:48.536
Come on, Roy!

01:46:02.489 --> 01:46:04.324
It's the funkyskunkulator!

01:46:04.325 --> 01:46:05.458
We've got to stop it.

01:46:05.459 --> 01:46:07.052
Don't touch any toggles.

01:46:08.729 --> 01:46:11.357
Rage taking over.

01:46:11.498 --> 01:46:13.933
Ja. We've heard
all that before.

01:46:15.569 --> 01:46:16.969
No, no.

01:46:17.204 --> 01:46:19.730
Rage really taking over.

01:47:10.357 --> 01:47:13.156
Frak-you later, Frankenpuss.

01:47:20.834 --> 01:47:21.995
Yeah!

01:47:40.587 --> 01:47:42.146
Get out of here.

01:47:47.461 --> 01:47:49.122
Hit the deck.

01:47:52.966 --> 01:47:55.026
How do we shut
this thing down?

01:47:56.003 --> 01:47:58.237
Group hug!

01:47:58.238 --> 01:48:00.036
Yeah! Okay!
Yeah!

01:48:05.913 --> 01:48:07.013
Hurry up!

01:48:07.014 --> 01:48:08.846
Get her closer to the hole!

01:48:12.286 --> 01:48:14.948
Dad, this is the way
it has to be.

01:48:15.255 --> 01:48:18.657
The upshot is you won't be killed
because you're already dead.

01:48:18.859 --> 01:48:20.693
No, I'm not going with you.

01:48:20.694 --> 01:48:24.597
If there's a time for separation,
let me tell you something, this is it.

01:48:24.598 --> 01:48:25.732
Lift me up.

01:48:25.733 --> 01:48:26.799
Push her up.

01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:29.769
Help me lift her up.
Help her.

01:48:29.770 --> 01:48:33.502
You can do it. Hold on.

01:48:36.310 --> 01:48:38.244
Do it!

01:48:38.245 --> 01:48:39.406
I love you, Dad!

01:48:50.157 --> 01:48:52.225
Run! Run!

01:48:52.226 --> 01:48:53.489
Let's get out of here!

01:48:53.627 --> 01:48:55.721
Run for your lives!

01:48:59.933 --> 01:49:01.299
Run!

01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:11.000
Go!

01:49:19.820 --> 01:49:21.481
Go! Go!

01:49:33.834 --> 01:49:36.636
No one could survive the chaos
we've just witnessed here.

01:49:36.637 --> 01:49:40.630
But as the dust begins to settle over
the ruins of the Casanova's mansion,

01:49:40.941 --> 01:49:43.009
the question remains.

01:49:43.010 --> 01:49:47.072
Who were these brave heroes that gave
their lives to save our city tonight?

01:49:47.247 --> 01:49:50.283
Did that frakulator work, or
what? What's the deal there?

01:49:50.284 --> 01:49:52.618
Look. Something's moving.
People are coming out.

01:49:52.619 --> 01:49:54.520
Could you tell us
what's going on?

01:49:54.521 --> 01:49:56.055
Hi. Excuse me.

01:49:56.056 --> 01:49:59.026
Can you tell us
what happened here tonight?

01:49:59.660 --> 01:50:00.860
We did it.
We won.

01:50:00.861 --> 01:50:02.056
Hey, that's my team.

01:50:02.596 --> 01:50:05.793
We struck down evil with
the mighty sword of teamwork

01:50:06.033 --> 01:50:07.633
and the hammer
of not-bickering.

01:50:07.634 --> 01:50:10.970
We are number one. All others
are number two or lower.

01:50:10.971 --> 01:50:12.370
Who are you guys?

01:50:13.140 --> 01:50:14.407
They call me the Shoveler.

01:50:14.408 --> 01:50:16.843
That's my dad.

01:50:18.011 --> 01:50:19.579
My hero.
I'm the Bowler.

01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:20.706
Hello.

01:50:23.484 --> 01:50:26.586
Blue Raja,
master of silverware. Hi, Mom.

01:50:26.587 --> 01:50:29.454
I mean, cheerio, Mummy.

01:50:29.723 --> 01:50:31.324
Jeffrey.

01:50:31.325 --> 01:50:32.492
And you, sir.

01:50:32.493 --> 01:50:34.760
What's your name
and your superpower?

01:50:34.761 --> 01:50:35.751
My name's Roy.

01:50:36.797 --> 01:50:39.599
I'm in a super amount of pain right
now. Could you please leave me alone?

01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:44.103
His name's Mr. Furious, and his
power comes from his boundless rage.

01:50:44.104 --> 01:50:48.074
Excuse me. Could I say something? I
think we would all like this victory

01:50:48.075 --> 01:50:50.209
to go out to
all the other guys.

01:50:50.210 --> 01:50:52.912
I'm talking about the people in this
city who are super good at their jobs

01:50:52.913 --> 01:50:56.182
but never get any credit,
like the lady in the D.M.V.

01:50:56.183 --> 01:50:57.483
That's a rough job.

01:50:57.484 --> 01:50:58.684
To the people
that remember jingles

01:50:58.685 --> 01:51:00.686
from tons of old commercials.

01:51:00.687 --> 01:51:03.389
And people that support local
music and seek out independent film.

01:51:03.390 --> 01:51:06.692
And the guy that drives the snow
plow. And the school nurse...

01:51:06.693 --> 01:51:08.594
Eddie, Eddie,
I think they got the point.

01:51:08.595 --> 01:51:10.463
What's the name of this group?

01:51:10.464 --> 01:51:11.731
The Super Dudes.

01:51:11.732 --> 01:51:13.432
No, not the Super Dudes.

01:51:13.433 --> 01:51:16.769
We don't have a name yet, but
definitely not the Super Dudes.

01:51:16.770 --> 01:51:18.571
I gotta get home.
It's late.

01:51:18.572 --> 01:51:20.802
Picture, picture time.

01:51:23.677 --> 01:51:27.446
Whatever you call them, Champion City
will forever owe a debt of gratitude

01:51:27.447 --> 01:51:29.439
to these mystery men.

01:51:29.650 --> 01:51:34.610
Wait. That's it.
We are the Super Squad.

01:51:35.055 --> 01:51:39.993
No! Alliteration in
these situations is corny.

01:51:40.627 --> 01:51:44.597
What? Yes, we're all very
aware that you saved the day,

01:51:44.598 --> 01:51:48.626
and I'm sure we'll be hearing
about it for the rest of our lives.
