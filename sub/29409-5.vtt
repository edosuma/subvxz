00:03.086 --> 00:04.129
<i>Amy: Previously on "Heartland"</i>

00:04.170 --> 00:05.547
- Luke, where is your mom?
- She's in the car.

00:10.719 --> 00:12.178
- Is this where
you've been staying?

00:12.220 --> 00:13.805
- Mhmm.
Lou: Hang on a sec.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.515
I just told my girls
that you're my boyfriend

00:15.557 --> 00:17.767
because you said
you were all in.

00:17.809 --> 00:19.561
What exactly are you saying?

00:19.602 --> 00:21.688
- I'm saying that I think
that we should get our...

00:23.231 --> 00:24.649
our own place together.

00:26.276 --> 00:28.528
(Pained grunts)
- Come on, Kirk!

00:28.570 --> 00:30.030
<i>Kirk: You saved them all.</i>
<i>Including me.</i>

00:30.071 --> 00:31.865
<i>You were the hero today.</i>
<i>I know that.</i>

00:31.906 --> 00:33.825
I'm gonna make sure
everyone else does too.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.745
- It's Andrea, right?
I'm Ty, this is my wife, Amy.

00:36.786 --> 00:39.372
We're the couple that's been
spending some time with Luke.

00:39.414 --> 00:42.417
- You can buy Luke all of
the horses in the world,

00:42.459 --> 00:44.669
but that doesn't change the
fact that I am his mother.

00:47.839 --> 00:53.303
**

00:53.345 --> 00:54.846
(Horse whinnies)

00:54.888 --> 00:56.389
(Horses snort)

00:56.431 --> 01:00.435
**

01:00.477 --> 01:02.479
(Tack jingles)

01:02.520 --> 01:10.570
**

01:10.612 --> 01:12.655
- We already looked here.

01:12.697 --> 01:14.491
- Yeah, horses move around,
you know,

01:14.532 --> 01:15.784
doesn't hurt to look again.

01:15.825 --> 01:17.535
- Well, it's been a week
since that storm.

01:17.577 --> 01:19.120
We should have found Champ
by now.

01:20.497 --> 01:21.873
We gotta widen the search.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.417
- No. We covered a lot
of ground today.

01:24.459 --> 01:26.628
I'm beat. It's best if we
start fresh in the morning.

01:28.129 --> 01:29.631
- There is still one place
I wanna check.

01:31.299 --> 01:33.468
- (Sighs)

01:36.012 --> 01:38.682
(Hooves rustle in the foliage)

01:38.723 --> 01:40.350
Amy: Well, the good news is,

01:40.392 --> 01:41.935
Ophelia wasn't traumatized
by the storm.

01:41.976 --> 01:43.645
- Oh, she wasn't?

01:43.687 --> 01:45.397
Ty: No. She was just
experiencing some discomfort

01:45.438 --> 01:47.357
from an infection on her legs.

01:47.399 --> 01:49.734
- Infection?
How did I miss that?

01:49.776 --> 01:51.820
- Well, it's hard to see
with her feathering,

01:51.861 --> 01:53.780
but good news is,
it's all cleared up now.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.990
- Oh. That's wonderful.

01:56.032 --> 01:58.118
I really can't thank you
guys enough.

01:58.159 --> 02:00.412
- It's our pleasure.
Ophelia can go home today.

02:00.453 --> 02:01.996
- Well, here's the thing, uh,

02:02.038 --> 02:04.457
my barn was badly damaged
in the storm.

02:04.499 --> 02:05.750
And the repairs
won't be finished

02:05.792 --> 02:07.752
until after the weekend.

02:07.794 --> 02:09.503
So if you can keep her with you
for a few more days,

02:09.545 --> 02:10.797
I'd be so grateful.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.549
- Yeah, I don't see that
being a problem.

02:12.590 --> 02:14.092
- If you want I could
exercise her.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.677
- I've never ridden
a Gypsy Vanner before.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.887
- (Small giggle) Sure.

02:17.929 --> 02:20.473
That'd be a real treat
for Ophelia.

02:20.515 --> 02:22.726
She doesn't get ridden much.
- Really?

02:22.767 --> 02:24.477
- Well, I'm not much
of a rider.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.521
I'm more a collector
of beautiful things:

02:27.772 --> 02:29.190
art work, jewelry...

02:31.192 --> 02:33.445
of course my prize possession,
Ophelia.

02:35.071 --> 02:37.532
- Well, if you're, if you're
happy with our services,

02:37.574 --> 02:39.117
we'd really appreciate if you
could leave us a review online.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.369
- Oh, of course.
It'd be my pleasure.

02:41.411 --> 02:42.704
- Thank you.

02:44.956 --> 02:46.541
(Sighs)

02:46.583 --> 02:47.834
(Tires crunch on gravel)

02:49.085 --> 02:50.795
- (Satisfied sigh)

02:50.837 --> 02:52.339
- I wasn't too pushy
with that review, was I?

02:52.380 --> 02:54.549
- No, not at all.
- Okay.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.593
- Thanks to you, Kirk took down
those comments

02:56.634 --> 02:58.470
and posted an apology.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.096
The phone is finally
ringing again.

03:00.138 --> 03:02.515
- It rang once, Amy.
We have one client.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.684
- Yes, but Colette
is well connected.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.644
So if she refers us
to her friends,

03:06.686 --> 03:08.355
then we'll have more business
than we can handle.

03:08.396 --> 03:10.607
- I hope so. I do.
- (Laughs)

03:10.648 --> 03:12.901
(Car engine rumbles)
Is that...?

03:14.819 --> 03:16.404
(Door opens)

03:16.446 --> 03:18.490
Ty: Hi Andrea?

03:18.531 --> 03:21.034
- Hi Ty. Amy.
- Hey.

03:21.076 --> 03:22.702
- We uh-we didn't know
you were coming.

03:22.744 --> 03:23.995
Clint must have forgotten
to tell us.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.789
- Oh, he doesn't know.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.582
I wanted it to be a surprise.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.000
Is Luke in the house?

03:29.042 --> 03:31.544
- Um...
- I'm not s-sure right--

03:31.586 --> 03:33.546
- I have something
that I want to give him.

03:33.588 --> 03:35.715
- Oh. Well, you can give it
to us and--

03:35.757 --> 03:37.592
- Yeah, we will make sure
he gets it.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.844
- I would rather give it
to him in person.

03:39.886 --> 03:42.055
It won't take long.
I promise.

03:42.097 --> 03:43.932
(Screen door shuts)
- Mom?!

03:47.394 --> 03:49.062
- Ah! (Laughs) Hello sunshine.

03:49.104 --> 03:50.980
- Oh! Mom!

03:51.022 --> 03:53.858
**

03:53.900 --> 03:55.610
- (Exited squeal) Oh!

03:59.531 --> 04:00.281
**

04:09.124 --> 04:09.958
**

04:15.255 --> 04:19.300
* And at the break of day
you sank into... *

04:20.427 --> 04:22.470
* Your dream *

04:22.512 --> 04:24.014
* You dreamer *

04:24.055 --> 04:26.474
* Oh, oh, oh, oh *

04:26.516 --> 04:28.309
* You dreamer *

04:30.478 --> 04:33.982
* You dreamer *

04:40.780 --> 04:42.824
- I missed you so much.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.200
- I missed you too.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.703
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

04:46.745 --> 04:48.663
- I wanted to surprise you.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.999
I have something for you.
- What?

04:54.961 --> 04:56.296
(Car door opens and shuts)

05:01.551 --> 05:03.762
Go ahead. Open it.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.305
- How about I open it inside?

05:05.347 --> 05:07.015
That way you can see
the house and my new room.

05:07.057 --> 05:09.684
Come on. Let's go!

05:09.726 --> 05:12.520
- Okay, slow down.
I'm coming.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.816
- I think I'm gonna call Clint?

05:16.858 --> 05:17.984
- That's a good idea.
I'll head in with them.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.611
- Okay.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.450
- This is the kitchen.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.327
Come on!

05:27.369 --> 05:29.704
And this is where we have big
family dinners.

05:31.831 --> 05:34.459
Katie, Lyndy - this is my mom.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.169
- Hi.

05:36.211 --> 05:38.254
- You should see my room.
It's amazing.

05:38.296 --> 05:40.090
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

05:40.131 --> 05:42.175
- Luke gets the whole attic
to himself.

05:42.217 --> 05:44.135
- Luke why don't you go clean
your room

05:44.177 --> 05:46.137
before your mom sees it.
- Do I have to?

05:46.179 --> 05:48.682
- Yes. It's a huge mess.

05:48.723 --> 05:52.060
And Katie could you maybe go
read Lyndy a book in your room.

05:52.102 --> 05:54.270
- But we just finished a book.

05:54.312 --> 05:55.730
- Then read another.

05:58.149 --> 05:59.818
- Come on, Lyndy.

05:59.859 --> 06:02.237
- Andrea, I guess, I'm just
a little confused.

06:02.278 --> 06:04.739
I thought we agreed that all
visits would be scheduled.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.408
- Then it wouldn't have
been a surprise.

06:07.826 --> 06:09.953
- Maybe next time you want
to surprise Luke

06:09.994 --> 06:11.788
you could talk to Ty and I
first.

06:11.830 --> 06:13.540
That way we're all
on the same page.

06:13.581 --> 06:14.958
- Do you want me to leave?

06:15.000 --> 06:16.835
- That's not what I said.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.753
I just-I wanna make sure we're
doing what's best for Luke.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.505
- Yeah. Okay.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.048
That makes both of us.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.675
(Receding footsteps thud)

06:26.469 --> 06:28.680
<i>Mitch: Wow, this is the place</i>
<i>you rented?</i>

06:28.722 --> 06:30.223
<i>Lou: I guess so...</i>

06:30.265 --> 06:31.725
<i>Mitch: Why's it for sale?</i>

06:31.766 --> 06:33.268
<i>Lou: I don't know.</i>

06:33.309 --> 06:34.936
(Cuts engine off, keys jingle)

06:34.978 --> 06:36.855
(Doors open and shut)

06:39.816 --> 06:41.860
- You know, this doesn't look
at all like the photos.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.278
Something isn't right.

06:43.319 --> 06:45.321
- Hold on. Wait.

06:45.363 --> 06:48.033
You put a new coat of paint
on those out buildings,

06:48.074 --> 06:49.743
and a herd of cattle
in this field.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.288
This is exactly the kind
of property

06:53.329 --> 06:55.749
that I wanna own one day.
- You know what we did.

06:55.790 --> 06:58.668
We were supposed to go left,
not right at the four way stop.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.920
- Oh? Oh. That's too bad.

07:02.464 --> 07:04.758
I could've definitely
spend a weekend here.

07:04.799 --> 07:06.217
- Hey. Wait 'til you see
the rustic cabin.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.136
It's quiet, secluded,

07:08.178 --> 07:09.929
and very romantic.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.681
- Oh, I like the sound of that.

07:11.723 --> 07:13.141
- Come on, let's go.

07:15.894 --> 07:17.062
(Doors open and shut)

07:21.941 --> 07:23.485
- Hey Sam.

07:24.736 --> 07:26.905
- Jack. Tim.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.948
- Well, that was quite
the storm last week?

07:28.990 --> 07:32.035
How'd you make out?
- Oh. I got pretty lucky.

07:32.077 --> 07:34.329
No major damage.
How about you, guys?

07:34.371 --> 07:37.040
- Pretty good considering.

07:37.082 --> 07:39.751
One unfortunate thing
we're missing a horse.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.796
- My horse, Champ.
You haven't seen him, have you?

07:42.837 --> 07:45.215
- No, I'm sorry I haven't.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.050
- Well, with all the fences
that have gone down,

07:47.092 --> 07:49.052
I thought maybe he might have
wondered on to Big River

07:49.094 --> 07:50.679
Mind if we have a look around?

07:52.305 --> 07:53.765
- Well, normally I wouldn't
have a problem with it,

07:53.807 --> 07:55.266
but with all these trees down
blocking the trails.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.268
I just don't think it's safe.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.229
- Well, Sam, I owned
the property for a long time.

07:59.270 --> 08:01.022
I kinda know it like
the back of my hand.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.274
I think we'll be okay.
- Yeah, well...

08:03.316 --> 08:05.235
I'm-I'm serious.

08:05.276 --> 08:07.070
My horse almost broke
his leg yesterday.

08:07.112 --> 08:09.239
And I just think you should
probably stay clear

08:09.280 --> 08:10.865
until I have a chance
to clean up all the trees.

08:10.907 --> 08:13.076
For your safety.

08:13.118 --> 08:16.329
But I will keep an eye out
for... Champ?

08:16.371 --> 08:18.081
He's that beautiful palomino,
right?

08:18.123 --> 08:19.916
- Yeah.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.835
- Yeah. All right. I'll let you
know if I see him.

08:21.876 --> 08:23.169
<i>- Well, that'll be much</i>
<i>appreciated.</i>

08:23.211 --> 08:24.879
We'll be on our way.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.926
- Well, that was real
neighbourly.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.136
- Ah. He's just being cautious,
is all.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.557
- Hey, why don't you open
this now?

08:37.933 --> 08:39.227
(Bag crinkles)

08:41.980 --> 08:43.523
(Paper rustles)

08:47.944 --> 08:49.779
- Wow...

08:49.821 --> 08:51.698
it's a drone!

08:51.740 --> 08:53.575
- Do you like it?
- I love it!

08:53.616 --> 08:56.786
This is amazing! I've always
wanted one of these!

08:56.828 --> 08:59.456
But aren't these expensive?

08:59.497 --> 09:02.334
- Don't you worry about that.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.419
I didn't see you for Christmas,

09:04.461 --> 09:06.921
and I only got you that card
for your birthday,

09:08.423 --> 09:10.592
so it's kind of like
two gifts in one.

09:11.926 --> 09:13.345
- Thank you so much, Mom.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.096
- Oh, you're welcome.

09:18.516 --> 09:21.269
Why don't we get this
out of the box

09:21.311 --> 09:22.937
and see how it works, huh?

09:24.939 --> 09:28.026
- Yeah, but first, I have
something to show you.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.114
(Hooves thud)

09:36.868 --> 09:38.828
(Boots snorts)

09:38.870 --> 09:48.630
**

09:49.881 --> 09:51.591
- Looks great, Luke.

09:55.345 --> 09:56.304
Andrea: (Happy laugh)

09:59.099 --> 10:00.392
- So what did you think?

10:00.433 --> 10:02.894
- I was so impressed.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.562
You look like a natural
out there.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.356
- Why don't you go help Ty,
Luke.

10:06.398 --> 10:07.982
- All right.

10:10.485 --> 10:11.903
- I can't believe
he can ride like that.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.530
- My Grandpa taught him.

10:13.571 --> 10:16.491
You know, he's been
practicing every day.

10:16.533 --> 10:19.953
- When Luke was younger he
was obsessed with dinosaurs

10:19.994 --> 10:22.997
then it was uh,
comic books and video games.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.417
I just never thought that
he'd be interested in horses.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.876
- Well, I never thought
I would be either.

10:26.918 --> 10:28.461
- Here.
- Thanks.

10:28.503 --> 10:29.713
But there is something
about this place.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.339
The longer you stay the more
it kinda gets in your blood.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.260
- Would it be okay if my mom
stayed for dinner?

10:37.095 --> 10:38.638
- Oh. I would love to,

10:39.973 --> 10:42.058
but I really should get going.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.643
- But you just got here.

10:45.395 --> 10:47.856
- She can stay, right, Amy?
- Yeah, sure.

10:53.194 --> 10:55.280
Mitch: Well, they got
the rustic part right.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.157
Lou: Yeah, just not
the charming.

10:59.951 --> 11:01.369
(Disappointed sigh)

11:01.411 --> 11:03.371
(Door creaks open)

11:06.041 --> 11:07.709
Oh boy.

11:13.089 --> 11:15.008
(Unimpressed exhale)

11:15.050 --> 11:16.801
- Well, I mean...

11:16.843 --> 11:18.762
it's not that bad.

11:18.803 --> 11:21.014
- What part isn't "that bad"?
The moldy food on the table

11:21.056 --> 11:24.225
or the 20-years of cigarette
smoke caked to the walls?

11:24.267 --> 11:26.061
- The part where you and I

11:26.102 --> 11:28.146
have the entire weekend
to ourselves.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.231
No distractions.
- Yeah. You're right.

11:30.273 --> 11:32.025
I'm still leaving
a very negative review,

11:32.067 --> 11:34.069
but you're right.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.904
Let's unload the truck
and we can make some dinner.

11:37.489 --> 11:40.909
- Or how about we just leave
that for right now.

11:44.329 --> 11:46.206
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:49.501 --> 11:51.294
(Mouse squeaks)
- Oh, Mitch.

11:51.336 --> 11:53.546
- Yeah. Agh.

11:53.588 --> 11:55.882
Um, what are the chances
that we can just

11:55.924 --> 11:57.634
ignore that right now and--

11:57.676 --> 12:00.303
(Mouse squeaks)
Okay. Fine.

12:00.345 --> 12:01.513
I will deal with the...

12:01.554 --> 12:03.848
mouse.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.183
<i>(Mouse squeaks)</i>

12:05.225 --> 12:07.102
- Don't kill it.

12:07.143 --> 12:08.937
- Yeah. No, I know.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.355
Catch and release.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.775
(Mouse squeaks)
- (Squeals)

12:19.948 --> 12:22.409
(Door opens)

12:22.450 --> 12:24.452
<i>(Approaching hooves thud)</i>

12:24.494 --> 12:26.121
(Door shuts)

12:26.162 --> 12:31.334
**

12:31.376 --> 12:33.086
(Slowed hooves echo)

12:33.128 --> 12:38.091
**

12:38.133 --> 12:40.427
- That horse...

12:40.468 --> 12:43.221
it's like something out
of a fairytale.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.806
- She's beautiful, isn't she?

12:46.224 --> 12:48.226
I don't think we've met.
I'm Georgie.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.936
- Oh. Andrea. Luke's mom.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.148
- Nice. He's a good kid.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.358
- Yeah, he told me about you.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.527
He said um,

12:57.569 --> 12:59.696
that you were a lot like him.

12:59.738 --> 13:01.364
That you came to this ranch
when you were his age.

13:01.406 --> 13:03.116
- Yeah, I did.

13:03.158 --> 13:05.577
I guess I-I've never left.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.329
My mom, Amy's sister,
adopted me seven years ago.

13:11.374 --> 13:12.834
<i>(Door opens)</i>

13:15.462 --> 13:17.255
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:19.174 --> 13:20.717
- Is there anything that
I can help with?

13:20.759 --> 13:22.469
- I don't think so.
Everything is made.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.137
I just have to heat it up.

13:24.179 --> 13:25.513
- Okay.

13:28.391 --> 13:30.226
Uh, (clears throat)

13:30.268 --> 13:33.188
look I know it was wrong for me
to just show up like this.

13:34.564 --> 13:36.316
- So why did you do it then?

13:36.358 --> 13:38.693
- Well, I had to see my son.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.528
Surely you can understand that
as a mother.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.697
- I can.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.574
And surely as a mother you
can understand

13:44.616 --> 13:47.202
why I was concerned.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.412
One of the last times I saw you
it was freezing cold,

13:49.454 --> 13:51.581
and Luke was sleeping
in your car.

13:51.623 --> 13:53.875
- And that was the worst night
of my life.

13:53.917 --> 13:56.461
I've been doing everything
in my power since then

13:56.503 --> 13:57.796
to get better.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.464
- You don't have to explain,
Andrea.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.549
- No, I want to.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.968
I've been struggling with
something for my entire life,

14:04.010 --> 14:06.054
not knowing what it was.

14:07.806 --> 14:09.391
When they told me
that I had bipolar disorder,

14:09.432 --> 14:11.559
I was actually relieved,

14:11.601 --> 14:13.395
because now at least
I have a name for it.

14:15.397 --> 14:18.274
And yeah, there've been some
bumps along the way,

14:18.316 --> 14:21.986
but my medication is really
helping me to deal with it,

14:22.028 --> 14:23.905
and so is my therapy.

14:26.491 --> 14:28.410
For the first time in my life,

14:28.451 --> 14:29.994
I can actually say that I'm
doing really, really well.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.788
- Well, that's great.

14:31.830 --> 14:34.207
I am happy for you.

14:34.249 --> 14:35.917
- Yeah.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.588
My doctor actually says,

14:40.630 --> 14:42.924
that I'm ready to leave
the facility now.

14:44.801 --> 14:47.887
I've got a job
and an apartment lined up.

14:49.389 --> 14:50.849
So it's not gonna be very long

14:50.890 --> 14:53.143
until Luke can move back
in with me.

14:53.184 --> 14:54.602
Hopefully by the beginning
of next month.

14:56.271 --> 14:58.273
- I don't' think you should
rush in anything.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.191
Luke can stay here
as long as--

15:00.233 --> 15:02.485
- Yeah. Thank you for
everything that you've done,

15:02.527 --> 15:04.362
but Luke belongs with me.

15:06.531 --> 15:08.408
And the sooner that
we're back together,

15:08.450 --> 15:10.076
the sooner we can all move on
with our lives.

15:10.118 --> 15:13.538
**

15:19.419 --> 15:21.796
- Remember the day we met Sam?
- Yeah.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.506
- Remember the first thing
out of his mouth was

15:23.548 --> 15:25.175
how much he liked
the look of Champ.

15:25.216 --> 15:26.801
And he offered to buy him,
and I said no way.

15:26.843 --> 15:29.220
You remember that?
- Yeah. So what?

15:29.262 --> 15:30.805
- Yeah. Well, what if Sam
is the kind of guy

15:30.847 --> 15:32.724
that doesn't like to take
no for an answer.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.517
Maybe he found Champ
after the storm

15:34.559 --> 15:36.394
and decided finders keepers.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.605
- Do you know how paranoid
you sound right now?

15:38.646 --> 15:40.190
- Yeah. Well, how else
do you explain my horse

15:40.231 --> 15:41.816
disappearing like that?

15:41.858 --> 15:43.735
The only place we haven't
checked is Big River.

15:43.777 --> 15:45.862
So where else could he be?
- Listen to me.

15:45.904 --> 15:48.323
I know you're concerned
about your horse,

15:48.365 --> 15:50.325
he'll turn up, we'll find him.

15:52.243 --> 15:54.287
- What if I'm right? Huh?

15:54.329 --> 15:55.705
We can't just do nothing.

15:55.747 --> 15:57.749
- I'll talk to Sam tomorrow.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.417
Alone. Neighbour to neighbour.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.628
I'd rather not make enemies
with the guy.

16:01.670 --> 16:03.254
Not if I don't have to.

16:07.842 --> 16:09.886
- Since when do you brush
client horses?

16:09.928 --> 16:11.805
- This isn't just any client
horse.

16:11.846 --> 16:13.807
This is a Gypsy Vanner.

16:13.848 --> 16:16.643
They're basically unicorns.
- (Small laugh)

16:16.685 --> 16:18.478
- Did you know they were
once used

16:18.520 --> 16:20.522
to pull caravans across Europe?

16:20.563 --> 16:22.440
- I did not.
But I'm not surprised.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.442
She is really powerful.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.861
- What was riding her like?
- Incredible!

16:26.903 --> 16:29.030
She's so smooth, but really
friendly and gentle.

16:30.740 --> 16:32.409
I can't believe she just spends
her life standing around

16:32.450 --> 16:34.619
in a field.
- What do you mean?

16:34.661 --> 16:36.413
- Well, her owner doesn't ride.

16:36.454 --> 16:38.206
She just likes the way Ophelia
looks.

16:38.248 --> 16:39.874
She's basically
a lawn ornament.

16:39.916 --> 16:42.711
- Well, that's just wrong.
- Yeah, it is.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.214
But maybe we could
do something about it.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.510
- She just showed up
out of the blue?

16:50.552 --> 16:52.387
- Yeah. She said she wanted
to surprise Luke.

16:54.806 --> 16:56.349
- Well, what? Is she having
some sort of mental breakdown?

16:56.391 --> 16:58.226
Or something?
- No.

16:58.268 --> 16:59.978
I mean, at least
I don't think so.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.855
I talked to Clint, and he said
that she's doing really well.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.356
- Well, she can't just show up
here whenever she wants,

17:03.398 --> 17:05.775
can she?
- She's not supposed to.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.609
And Clint said that we could
ask her to leave

17:07.652 --> 17:09.945
if we wanted to but...
- What good would that do?

17:09.988 --> 17:12.406
Well, if Andrea's doing better,

17:12.449 --> 17:14.534
and there's no reason
to believe

17:14.576 --> 17:16.536
that she's a danger to Luke,
then...

17:16.578 --> 17:19.414
well, uninvited or not,
she's our guest so.

17:19.455 --> 17:21.665
- Yeah.
- Yeah. You're right.

17:23.292 --> 17:24.877
- Let's wash up for dinner then.

17:24.919 --> 17:26.588
- Okay.

17:33.428 --> 17:35.388
- You okay?
- Yeah.

17:37.015 --> 17:38.725
Yeah, it's good news
about Andrea.

17:40.643 --> 17:41.853
I guess that means that Luke
will be able to move back in

17:41.895 --> 17:43.938
with her soon.

17:43.980 --> 17:46.316
- Well, that was the plan
all along, right?

17:46.358 --> 17:47.734
For him to be reunited
with his mom.

17:47.776 --> 17:49.444
- Mhmm.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.783
You know, when we were
designing our new house,

17:54.824 --> 17:56.534
I always pictured the room
across from Lyndy's

17:56.576 --> 17:58.244
to be Luke's.

17:58.286 --> 17:59.621
- Yeah. Me too.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.083
- I guess, I just thought
we'd have more time.

18:06.503 --> 18:08.171
- So did I.

18:08.213 --> 18:13.134
**

18:14.594 --> 18:15.929
- Thanks, Amy.

18:15.970 --> 18:17.889
Everything was wonderful.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.557
- You're welcome.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.142
- (Small giggle)

18:22.936 --> 18:25.980
Oh boy, it's getting late I
should probably hit the road.

18:26.022 --> 18:28.358
- You're not driving back
to the city tonight, are you?

18:28.400 --> 18:31.569
- On no, I was planning on
staying at a motel in Hudson.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.488
- Don't be silly,
you can stay here.

18:34.989 --> 18:37.492
- That's really generous
of you but...

18:37.534 --> 18:39.828
you've already been more
than kind.

18:39.869 --> 18:41.788
- No. I'm serious.

18:41.830 --> 18:43.081
My sister is away
for the weekend.

18:43.123 --> 18:44.833
You can stay in her room.
It's no trouble.

18:46.543 --> 18:48.128
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

18:49.254 --> 18:51.256
And...

18:51.297 --> 18:54.634
I'm sorry about earlier.

18:54.676 --> 18:56.761
If I was being a little hard
on you.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.930
- Oh... uh...

18:58.972 --> 19:01.016
no, it's okay.

19:01.057 --> 19:03.560
I feel like I should be
the one to apologize.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.687
I really should have told you
that I was coming.

19:09.691 --> 19:11.526
- Okay. I'll go and get my
stuff out of the car then.

19:12.861 --> 19:14.154
- Okay.

19:15.405 --> 19:17.615
- Hey Amy,

19:17.657 --> 19:19.909
you are making it really hard.

19:19.951 --> 19:21.703
- What?

19:21.745 --> 19:24.205
- To not like you.

19:26.041 --> 19:27.792
- (Small laugh)

19:29.419 --> 19:30.545
(Door creaks open)

19:33.089 --> 19:34.549
- Hey, you know what my
favourite part of this weekend

19:34.591 --> 19:36.634
has been so far?

19:36.676 --> 19:38.678
- Was it the mouse eating
crumbs off the table?

19:38.720 --> 19:40.555
Or the fact that
there's no hot water?

19:41.765 --> 19:43.767
- Neither of those things.

19:43.808 --> 19:44.809
Was having coffee with you
this morning.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.895
- Oh.

19:46.936 --> 19:49.189
- You read your book.
I made us eggs.

19:49.230 --> 19:51.649
I know it's just a small,
simple thing, but...

19:51.691 --> 19:53.526
it got me really excited
about us living together.

19:53.568 --> 19:55.445
- Me too.

19:55.487 --> 19:57.572
- Speaking of which,

19:57.614 --> 19:58.948
I think that we should
start looking for a place.

19:58.990 --> 20:01.117
- Yeah. Absolutely.

20:01.159 --> 20:02.994
- You think we should
get a three bedrooms?

20:03.036 --> 20:05.163
Like one for us, one for Katie
and one for Georgie?

20:05.205 --> 20:06.706
Or do you think Georgie's
gonna wanna stay

20:06.748 --> 20:08.792
at the loft in Heartland?

20:08.833 --> 20:10.752
- I don't know.
I haven't thought about it.

20:10.794 --> 20:12.629
- I mean, if I was Georgie
I would wanna stay.

20:12.671 --> 20:14.589
It's just like having your
own apartment.

20:14.631 --> 20:16.091
But we gotta make sure
Katie has an awesome room.

20:16.132 --> 20:18.093
She's gonna lose her mind
when she realizes

20:18.134 --> 20:19.552
she doesn't have to share
with anybody.

20:19.594 --> 20:21.388
- Yeah... totally.
You all set?

20:22.555 --> 20:24.265
- Yeah. Ready.

20:25.809 --> 20:28.353
- Okay, I'll call a realtor
next week,

20:28.395 --> 20:29.938
get the ball rolling.

20:29.979 --> 20:31.606
Hopefully we can find a place

20:31.648 --> 20:33.066
before Katie starts school
in the fall.

20:33.108 --> 20:34.859
- Yeah, that would be...
perfect.

20:37.821 --> 20:40.031
- Okay. Just wait.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.700
(Horse whinnies
in the distance)

20:41.741 --> 20:43.451
Okay, open your eyes.

20:43.493 --> 20:45.078
<i>(Georgie laughs)</i>

20:45.120 --> 20:46.538
I tried to make it look like
a caravan.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.165
What do you think?
- That depends.

20:49.207 --> 20:51.418
Do I get to ride in it?
- Of course.

20:51.459 --> 20:52.877
- Then I love it.

20:54.504 --> 20:56.047
Come on, let's go!

20:56.089 --> 20:58.591
(Drone buzzes)

20:58.633 --> 21:00.719
- This is so amazing, Mom.
Thank you so much.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.512
- You're really good at this.

21:02.554 --> 21:03.930
(Drone buzzes)

21:03.972 --> 21:05.724
(Wagon rattles)

21:05.765 --> 21:08.893
(Drone buzzes)

21:08.935 --> 21:11.646
- Is that the-the drone?

21:11.688 --> 21:14.024
- Yeah.
- Where is it?

21:14.065 --> 21:16.317
- It's behind the wagon there.
- Oh yeah.

21:19.070 --> 21:22.157
So... so what does that do?

21:22.198 --> 21:23.992
- Well, that's to pitch
the camera up and down.

21:24.034 --> 21:26.369
You see?
- Look how clear that is?

21:26.411 --> 21:28.621
- Yeah.

21:28.663 --> 21:30.623
- Can I talk to you guys
for a second.

21:30.665 --> 21:32.459
- Yeah.
- In private.

21:32.500 --> 21:33.918
- Sure.

21:39.257 --> 21:41.634
- I was thinking of taking
Luke out for ice cream later.

21:41.676 --> 21:43.678
- Okay. Why don't we all go?

21:45.221 --> 21:47.432
- I was hoping it could
just be the two of us.

21:47.474 --> 21:49.267
- Oh.

21:49.309 --> 21:51.603
- I'll be heading back
to the city tonight,

21:51.644 --> 21:54.022
and I thought it might be nice
to spend some time with Luke

21:54.064 --> 21:56.024
before I have to say goodbye.

21:57.692 --> 21:59.527
It won't be a problem,
will it?

21:59.569 --> 22:01.529
- Uh. No.
Yeah, it's fine.

22:03.114 --> 22:04.574
- He's probably gonna ask
for two scoop, though--

22:04.616 --> 22:05.950
- And he'll never finish it.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.660
(Chuckles)
I know.

22:10.163 --> 22:12.082
- How far can you fly
that thing?

22:12.123 --> 22:14.000
- Pretty far.
- Yeah. 50 meters?

22:14.042 --> 22:16.670
A thousand meters?
- I dunno.

22:16.711 --> 22:18.380
Ty said I'm only allowed
to use it in the yard.

22:21.549 --> 22:23.051
- Can I try it?

22:25.303 --> 22:27.013
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

22:27.055 --> 22:29.766
- Stay. Just...

22:29.808 --> 22:31.768
- Yeah, here. There you go.

22:31.810 --> 22:33.353
- Okay. Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah.

22:33.395 --> 22:36.815
- I can't get over how great
this property is.

22:36.856 --> 22:39.025
- Yeah, it has a lot of
potential.

22:39.067 --> 22:41.069
I wonder how much
it's selling for.

22:42.696 --> 22:44.739
- It's actually less than
you think.

22:44.781 --> 22:46.241
- How would you know?

22:46.282 --> 22:48.743
- I looked it up last night.

22:48.785 --> 22:51.287
- Really?
- Yeah. Just out of curiosity.

22:51.329 --> 22:53.039
I know we can't really
consider it,

22:53.081 --> 22:54.666
it's too far away from Hudson.
But...

22:54.708 --> 22:57.252
I don't know, wouldn't,

22:57.293 --> 22:59.170
wouldn't you think we'd be
happy at a place like this.

22:59.212 --> 23:01.172
- Yeah, about that...

23:01.214 --> 23:03.174
I know we said we'd look
at places next week,

23:03.216 --> 23:05.760
but... I'm kinda busy
at the diner so.

23:07.470 --> 23:08.972
- That's all right,
we can do it the week after.

23:09.014 --> 23:11.182
- Yeah... okay.

23:11.224 --> 23:13.893
It's just so busy in the summer
at the dude ranch.

23:13.935 --> 23:15.937
Maybe the fall would be better,

23:15.979 --> 23:18.148
although we're already
booking up.

23:18.189 --> 23:20.275
So I'd... I'd have to see.
- Actually I was thinking

23:20.316 --> 23:22.318
that we would be living
together by fall.

23:22.360 --> 23:24.237
- (Sighs) I just...

23:24.279 --> 23:26.114
I don't think that's realistic.

23:26.156 --> 23:28.533
- Okay...um...

23:30.118 --> 23:32.412
what do you think
a realistic time frame?

23:34.122 --> 23:35.915
- I don't know.

23:35.957 --> 23:37.792
- You don't know.

23:40.128 --> 23:41.463
Listen, Lou, um...

23:43.214 --> 23:45.884
I'm a little confused here.

23:45.925 --> 23:49.179
Okay. I jus--I-I need you
to be honest with me.

23:49.220 --> 23:51.431
Are we moving in together
or not?

23:54.100 --> 23:56.394
- (Reluctant exhale)
- Great.

23:56.436 --> 23:58.188
I guess that's my answer
right there.

23:58.229 --> 24:00.023
- No, Mitch.

24:00.065 --> 24:03.943
**

24:03.985 --> 24:05.820

(Tires crunch)

24:15.121 --> 24:17.457
(Engine rumbles)

24:24.172 --> 24:26.925
- Mom? I think we're going
the wrong way.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.510
The ranch is in the other
direction.

24:31.012 --> 24:33.014
- We're not going back
to the ranch just yet.

24:33.056 --> 24:35.183
- Why not?

24:35.225 --> 24:37.936
- It's a surprise.

24:37.977 --> 24:40.647
- But won't Ty and Amy
wonder where we are?

24:45.193 --> 24:47.278
Mom, I don't need any more
surprises.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.114
You already got me the drone.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.949
- But this is something
different.

24:53.451 --> 24:55.203
You're gonna love it.

24:55.245 --> 25:01.626
**

25:01.668 --> 25:03.712
- Good girl, Ophelia.

25:03.753 --> 25:05.213
(Latch clicks)

25:07.674 --> 25:09.634
(Horse whinnies)

25:09.676 --> 25:12.137
Hey, they should be back by now.

25:13.972 --> 25:15.849
- It's only been a couple
of hours.

25:15.890 --> 25:17.559
- How long does it take
to get ice cream?

25:20.812 --> 25:22.939
(Engine rumbles)

25:22.981 --> 25:28.570
**

25:31.823 --> 25:38.163
**

25:38.204 --> 25:40.081
- We can't wait any longer, Amy.

25:40.123 --> 25:42.542
I have to call the police.

25:44.085 --> 25:46.379
- Okay.

25:46.421 --> 25:49.049
(Stressed sigh)

25:49.090 --> 25:51.134
<i>(Car rumbles up)</i>
<i>- (Stressed exhale)</i>

25:51.176 --> 25:53.053
- Ty, wait.

25:53.094 --> 25:54.596
Wait. I think that's them.

25:56.139 --> 25:57.932
(Annoyed sigh)

25:57.974 --> 25:59.726
(Car doors open and close)

25:59.768 --> 26:02.604
- (Relieved sigh)

26:07.025 --> 26:09.361
- Hey.
- Hey,

26:09.402 --> 26:11.905
sorry we're a little bit late.

26:11.946 --> 26:13.156
- Luke, why don't you go up
to your room

26:13.198 --> 26:14.616
and get ready for bed.

26:17.827 --> 26:19.287
- It's okay, go ahead.

26:23.083 --> 26:25.168
- Where were you?

26:25.210 --> 26:27.754
- We went to get ice cream.
I told you.

26:27.796 --> 26:30.423
- For this whole time?
- No.

26:30.465 --> 26:34.302
Uh, we went to go and see a
movie in Calgary afterwards.

26:34.344 --> 26:36.888
- Andrea, you should
have called first.

26:36.930 --> 26:38.348
We didn't know where you were.
I almost called the police.

26:38.390 --> 26:40.308
- The police?
- Yes.

26:40.350 --> 26:42.227
- Look, I know that we're
a little bit late,

26:42.268 --> 26:44.020
but I don't see why
you're making

26:44.062 --> 26:45.855
such a big deal out of this.

26:45.897 --> 26:47.273
- Because we're his foster
parents

26:47.315 --> 26:49.401
if anything happens to him,
we're responsible.

26:49.442 --> 26:51.736
- Well, not for long.

26:51.778 --> 26:53.238
- Where are you going?

26:53.279 --> 26:54.948
- To say goodnight to my son.

27:00.036 --> 27:01.913
(Footsteps thud on stairs)

27:08.086 --> 27:09.629
I'm leaving now.

27:11.548 --> 27:12.674
I just wanted to say goodbye.

27:17.387 --> 27:19.097
Are you mad at me?

27:22.475 --> 27:24.477
Okay.

27:24.519 --> 27:26.688
I know I should have told them.

27:28.273 --> 27:30.025
But everything is fine now.

27:35.447 --> 27:37.991
- No, Mom, it's not fine.

27:39.534 --> 27:42.203
Amy and Ty--
- Yeah, I talked to them.

27:42.245 --> 27:44.122
They're good.

27:44.164 --> 27:45.957
- Mom,

27:45.999 --> 27:47.375
I'm not good.

27:48.877 --> 27:50.795
I...

27:53.006 --> 27:55.050
I was scared.

27:55.091 --> 27:57.010
- You don't have to be scared.

27:57.052 --> 27:59.888
Ty and Amy were upset with me,
not you.

28:01.348 --> 28:03.016
I'm the adult, remember?

28:05.226 --> 28:07.562
I just wanted you
to have a good time.

28:07.604 --> 28:10.565
- I wasn't scared I was gonna
get in trouble.

28:10.607 --> 28:12.734
I was scared that
we weren't coming back.

28:14.736 --> 28:17.113
I thought we were gonna leave
without saying goodbye.

28:17.155 --> 28:19.407
- Why would you think that?

28:19.449 --> 28:21.910
- Because that's what
happened the last time.

28:21.951 --> 28:24.079
You said we were going
on a trip,

28:24.120 --> 28:25.914
but it wasn't just a trip.

28:29.334 --> 28:31.169
We never went back home.

28:32.337 --> 28:33.838
- Luke...

28:35.090 --> 28:37.092
I am so, so sorry

28:38.510 --> 28:40.428
that I ever did that to you.

28:42.347 --> 28:44.349
Okay?

28:44.391 --> 28:46.393
- It wasn't your fault.

28:46.434 --> 28:48.269
You weren't feeling well.

28:51.439 --> 28:54.943
- That's why I've been
working so hard,

28:57.195 --> 28:59.948
and doing everything that
the doctors tell me to do

29:03.076 --> 29:04.494
because I'm gonna make sure
that nothing like that

29:04.536 --> 29:06.037
ever happens again.

29:09.499 --> 29:12.002
- Promise?

29:12.043 --> 29:14.170
- Yes, I promise.

29:14.212 --> 29:24.305
**

29:24.347 --> 29:26.474
<i>(Approaching footsteps thud)</i>

29:31.021 --> 29:32.439
Ty: Andrea?

29:35.650 --> 29:37.444
(Sighs)

29:37.485 --> 29:38.903
<i>(Door shuts)</i>

29:44.701 --> 29:46.202
- Hey Sam!

29:46.244 --> 29:48.246
(Door slams)

29:48.288 --> 29:50.206
How goes the clean up?

29:50.248 --> 29:51.624
- You know, we're getting
there - little by little.

29:51.666 --> 29:54.502
- Listen, I came back
to ask you...

29:54.544 --> 29:56.838
would it really be
that big a deal

29:56.880 --> 30:00.008
if Tim and I took a quick look
around your ranch for Champ?

30:01.551 --> 30:03.261
- It's not necessary.

30:03.303 --> 30:05.096
I've been keeping an eye out,

30:05.138 --> 30:06.806
I haven't seen your horse.
- Still...

30:06.848 --> 30:09.642
we'd just spend a couple
of hours here.

30:09.684 --> 30:12.270
And I know we'd all sleep way
better at night

30:12.312 --> 30:14.356
knowing that we looked
everywhere.

30:14.397 --> 30:16.858
- Well, like I said before,

30:16.900 --> 30:18.860
I don't think it's a good idea.
It's not safe.

30:20.445 --> 30:23.239
- (Small chuckle)
You know,

30:23.281 --> 30:26.034
you almost sound like you might
have something to hide.

30:28.745 --> 30:31.206
(Saw whirs loudly)

30:37.420 --> 30:39.172
- Mounted archery?

30:39.214 --> 30:40.799
You haven't done that
in awhile.

30:40.840 --> 30:42.967
- I thought I'd give it a try
on Ophelia.

30:43.009 --> 30:44.594
- On Ophelia?

30:44.636 --> 30:46.471
- She's really talented, Amy.

30:46.513 --> 30:49.140
- You told Colette that you
would exercise her horse.

30:49.182 --> 30:51.142
Hooking Ophelia up to a wagon
was already pushing it.

30:51.184 --> 30:52.977
This might be too much
too soon.

30:53.019 --> 30:54.479
- She's ready for it.

30:54.521 --> 30:56.272
She's bored of standing around

30:56.314 --> 30:58.316
and desperate
for some activity.

30:58.358 --> 31:00.527
- Colette is our first client
in a very long time.

31:00.568 --> 31:02.278
We need to have a happy
customer.

31:02.320 --> 31:04.447
- I get that, but...

31:04.489 --> 31:06.241
what if none of this Kirk stuff
had ever happened?

31:06.282 --> 31:08.159
And it was just business
as usual,

31:08.201 --> 31:10.537
and Colette told you that
her super talented horse

31:10.578 --> 31:12.706
would just stand around
for the rest of her life?

31:12.747 --> 31:15.875
- It's a lot more complicated
than that. Okay?

31:15.917 --> 31:18.253
We're talking about the future
of our business here.

31:18.294 --> 31:19.587
- And I'm talking about
the future of a horse,

31:21.506 --> 31:23.091
something that used to matter
to you more than business.

31:24.509 --> 31:26.428
You should ride her.
Then you'll see.

31:26.469 --> 31:31.725

31:53.788 --> 31:55.957

31:55.999 --> 31:58.126
and I'm starting to think
you might be right about him.

32:00.837 --> 32:02.339
What's that you got there?

32:02.380 --> 32:04.174
- It's a controller
for a drone.

32:04.215 --> 32:06.134
It's Luke's new toy.

32:06.176 --> 32:07.886
- Why do you have it?

32:07.927 --> 32:10.305
- Because I'm using it to
search Big River for my horse.

32:12.932 --> 32:14.476
The best part is,
it's not even trespassing.

32:16.436 --> 32:18.355
- I don't even know
where to start right now.

32:18.396 --> 32:20.357
- Cool down,
it's not a big deal.

32:20.398 --> 32:22.776
- Not a big deal?
Have you lost your marbles?

32:22.817 --> 32:24.569
First of all, I can't believe
you stole a kid's toy.

32:24.611 --> 32:26.404
- I borrowed it.

32:26.446 --> 32:28.782
- And second,
trespassing is trespassing -

32:28.823 --> 32:30.867
whether it's on the ground
or in the air.

32:30.909 --> 32:32.660
- Well, I wouldn't have to do
it in the first place

32:32.702 --> 32:34.788
if Sam had been a more
reasonable guy.

32:34.829 --> 32:36.831
But doesn't really matter

32:36.873 --> 32:38.416
because I've searched
the whole property.

32:38.458 --> 32:40.585
And there's no sign of Champ.

32:40.627 --> 32:42.545
- Who is that?
- I don't--

32:42.587 --> 32:44.631
That looks like Sam.

32:44.673 --> 32:46.758
- Oh great, now he thinks
we're spying on him.

32:46.800 --> 32:48.802
- He can't see us, Jack.

32:48.843 --> 32:50.762
He sees the drone
it's not two way thing.

32:50.804 --> 32:52.806
- Oh. Well, you better fly it
out of there.

32:52.847 --> 32:55.266
- I'm trying, to do that.

32:55.308 --> 32:57.143
Jack: What's he got
in his hands?

32:57.185 --> 32:58.603
<i>Tim: I don't know.</i>

32:58.645 --> 33:00.355
Let me-let me get closer.

33:00.397 --> 33:02.107
That looks...

33:03.316 --> 33:04.693
(Gunshots pop)

33:04.734 --> 33:06.194
that looks like a gun.

33:07.779 --> 33:09.364
That's not good.

33:15.453 --> 33:17.122
(Car rumbles, tires splash)

33:19.332 --> 33:21.209
(Hooves thud)

33:24.754 --> 33:26.548

33:35.724 --> 33:37.392

(Car door shuts)

33:38.685 --> 33:41.730
<i>(Horse whinnies)</i>

33:46.568 --> 33:47.777
- Don't worry,
I'm not here to see Luke.

33:47.819 --> 33:49.529
- (Sighs)

33:49.571 --> 33:51.781
- I just wanted to talk to you.

33:51.823 --> 33:54.409
Um...

33:54.451 --> 33:56.494
that horse that you were riding
it...

33:56.536 --> 33:57.495
could be in a storybook.

33:59.080 --> 34:01.666
This whole ranch
could be in a storybook.

34:01.708 --> 34:05.754
I thought that if I bought Luke
an expensive gift,

34:05.795 --> 34:09.674
and took him to see a movie
that he would think

34:09.716 --> 34:11.801
that I was just as exciting
as this place.

34:11.842 --> 34:14.346
- You don't have to prove
anything to Luke.

34:14.387 --> 34:15.764
- That's easy for you to say.

34:17.389 --> 34:19.391
You should hear how he talks
about Heartland,

34:20.560 --> 34:22.437
like it's a fairytale.

34:24.356 --> 34:26.565
- Andrea, that's the thing
about fairytales

34:26.608 --> 34:28.485
they're not real.

34:28.525 --> 34:29.985
Luke wants is to be with you

34:30.027 --> 34:31.654
more than anything
in the world.

34:31.696 --> 34:34.074
That's real.

34:34.114 --> 34:36.368
- I just don't know
if I'm ready yet.

34:39.245 --> 34:41.873
But I will be.

34:41.915 --> 34:43.625
I'm gonna do what I need to do
to get well,

34:45.251 --> 34:46.543
and to stay that way.

34:50.965 --> 34:53.802
The next time I come

34:53.842 --> 34:55.719
I'm gonna be the kind of mom
that Luke deserves.

34:57.263 --> 34:59.099
- I believe you.

35:02.310 --> 35:04.396
- Okay. I should go.

35:06.940 --> 35:08.650
- Hey, Andrea.

35:11.361 --> 35:13.488
You're making it hard.
- What?

35:14.698 --> 35:17.283
- To not like you.

35:17.325 --> 35:18.827
- (Elated laugh, sniffles)

35:21.496 --> 35:22.664
(Sighs)

35:24.040 --> 35:25.625
- (Content exhale)

35:27.544 --> 35:29.170
(Footsteps thud)

35:30.839 --> 35:32.507
(Door creaks, bangs shut)

35:34.843 --> 35:37.595
- Okay.

35:37.637 --> 35:38.847
You said you wanted me
to be honest

35:38.888 --> 35:40.432
so here it goes...

35:41.975 --> 35:44.602
I need more time.

35:44.644 --> 35:47.647
I love you, Mitch, I do.

35:47.689 --> 35:49.524
And I wanna live with you,

35:49.566 --> 35:50.984
but I need more time.

35:51.026 --> 35:52.694
I need more time
for Georgie and Katie,

35:52.736 --> 35:55.113
and for myself.
(Sighs)

35:55.155 --> 35:57.532
I'm always rushing into things,

35:57.574 --> 35:59.200
I rush into everything.
And I just...

36:00.827 --> 36:03.329
I wanna get this right.

36:03.371 --> 36:05.165
- Okay.

36:06.791 --> 36:09.627
I'm good with that.

36:09.669 --> 36:12.172
- You are?
- Yeah...

36:13.965 --> 36:15.842
because I wanna get us
right too.

36:20.513 --> 36:23.308
And if that means waiting
until you're ready then...

36:25.185 --> 36:27.437
that means waiting until
you're ready

36:27.479 --> 36:28.563
- (Sighs) Thank you.

36:30.357 --> 36:31.941
- Thank you...

36:31.983 --> 36:34.235
for being honest with me.

36:34.277 --> 36:36.363
Because that's the only way
that this is gonna work, Lou.

36:36.404 --> 36:37.739
- I totally agree.

36:39.783 --> 36:42.035
- And now...

36:42.077 --> 36:45.497
my turn to be honest
with you about something.

36:47.374 --> 36:48.750
- Okay.

36:50.543 --> 36:51.920
- I've got this idea,

36:53.922 --> 36:55.507
and I think it's gonna take
the pressure

36:55.548 --> 36:57.008
off of us living together.

36:57.050 --> 36:59.219
- I'm listening.

37:00.845 --> 37:03.765
- I think that we should buy
a property,

37:03.807 --> 37:06.893
but like just a vacation
property.

37:06.935 --> 37:09.562
Some place that we can go to
on the weekends

37:09.604 --> 37:10.939
or on holidays.

37:10.980 --> 37:13.733
Some place where we can go

37:13.775 --> 37:17.487
get away from our crazy lives
and just be together.

37:17.529 --> 37:19.155
- You mean like in
the Caribbean?

37:19.197 --> 37:21.366
Like on those TV shows or...?

37:21.408 --> 37:23.368
- Ah... kind of...

37:24.994 --> 37:27.288
but much closer.

37:30.709 --> 37:32.544
- (Small laugh)

37:32.585 --> 37:34.754
Colette: Thank you for taking
such good care of her.

37:34.796 --> 37:36.631
I really can't thank you enough

37:36.673 --> 37:38.174
for letting her stay here
the weekend with you.

37:38.216 --> 37:39.801
- Yeah. No worries.

37:42.637 --> 37:45.557
- Hey, Georgie why don't you
and Katie,

37:45.598 --> 37:47.475
show Colette what you've been
working on with Ophelia.

37:47.517 --> 37:48.768
- Really?
- Yeah.

37:48.810 --> 37:50.311
- Okay.

37:54.733 --> 37:56.693
(Hooves thunder)

37:56.735 --> 38:02.741

38:30.518 --> 38:34.606
**

38:34.647 --> 38:36.316
(Clapping)

38:38.943 --> 38:41.071
- That was quite impressive.

38:41.112 --> 38:43.698
Amy: We just wanted to show you
what Ophelia was capable of.

38:43.740 --> 38:45.825
- Well, it sounds like
she'll be happy to have

38:45.867 --> 38:47.786
a little peace and quiet
at home.

38:47.827 --> 38:49.245
- Actually um,

38:49.287 --> 38:51.206
that's kinda the problem,

38:51.247 --> 38:53.208
she won't be happy.

38:53.249 --> 38:56.169
- Uh, I think what Georgie
is trying to say is that,

38:56.211 --> 38:59.839
Ophelia could use some exercise
every now and then.

38:59.881 --> 39:02.717
- And even that's not enough.
She's capable of so much more.

39:02.759 --> 39:04.511
- (Amused chuckle)

39:04.552 --> 39:06.012
So what do you suggest I do,

39:06.054 --> 39:07.931
take up horse back archery?

39:07.972 --> 39:10.725
I'm not a circus performer.

39:10.767 --> 39:13.103
And I'm certainly not going
to sell her to some stranger.

39:13.144 --> 39:14.854
- Well, she's not just some
piece of art

39:14.896 --> 39:16.564
you can put on display.

39:18.316 --> 39:20.235
- Ophelia is my horse,

39:20.276 --> 39:22.237
and she has a good life.

39:22.278 --> 39:25.156
Now, if it's not too much
trouble,

39:25.198 --> 39:27.158
could you please put her
in my trailer so I can leave.

39:27.200 --> 39:28.868
Thank you.

39:28.910 --> 39:33.915
**

39:39.379 --> 39:41.965
- Yeah, that's right.
That's the piece.

39:42.007 --> 39:43.717
There you go.
You take that one.

39:43.758 --> 39:45.176
And you go.
Good job.

39:45.218 --> 39:46.928
- Hello.

39:48.847 --> 39:50.390
- Hey, Tim.

39:50.432 --> 39:53.226
- Luke, thank you for lending
me your drone.

39:53.268 --> 39:55.145
- I didn't lend it to you.

39:55.186 --> 39:57.188
- Right, whatever.
I borrowed it.

39:57.230 --> 39:58.982
Now I'm returning it.

39:59.024 --> 40:01.151
- Why is it back in the box?

40:01.192 --> 40:03.445
- Be-because...

40:03.486 --> 40:06.781
I discovered it had some
technical difficulties,

40:06.823 --> 40:08.950
so I bought you a new one.

40:11.077 --> 40:12.620
Yeah, you're welcome.

40:12.662 --> 40:15.331
Oh, that rule that Ty's has

40:15.373 --> 40:17.250
about flying it only
around our property?

40:17.292 --> 40:18.960
That's an important rule.
Follow that rule.

40:20.170 --> 40:22.505
Okay.

40:22.547 --> 40:24.424
Bye.

40:31.806 --> 40:33.183
Keith: Congratulations.

40:33.224 --> 40:34.976
- Thank you.

40:36.895 --> 40:38.646
- We'll be in touch.
- Thank you.

40:41.358 --> 40:43.026
We bought a ranch.
- We bought a ranch.

40:43.068 --> 40:45.195
(Both laugh)

40:45.236 --> 40:47.364
- So what do we call
this place?

40:47.405 --> 40:49.074
Our vacation ranch?

40:49.115 --> 40:50.909
Our hobby ranch?

40:50.950 --> 40:53.370
- How about: Aspen Grove Ranch,

40:53.411 --> 40:55.330
our home away from home?

40:55.372 --> 40:57.248
- I like it.

40:57.290 --> 40:59.084
Come on.

40:59.125 --> 41:00.752
Oh wait. Wait-wait-wait.
- What?

41:00.794 --> 41:02.170
- I always wanted to do this.

41:03.838 --> 41:05.632
- You crazy.

41:05.674 --> 41:08.385
You're so romantic.
- I know.

41:08.426 --> 41:10.637
- Okay. So Dad and Grandpa
are gonna check the south side

41:10.679 --> 41:12.263
of the property for Champ.

41:12.305 --> 41:13.390
We should probably start
with the north.

41:13.431 --> 41:15.100
- Yeah. Sounds like a plan.

41:15.141 --> 41:16.935
(Lyndy giggles)
(Approaching engine rumbles)

41:16.976 --> 41:18.812
(Door opens and shuts)

41:20.188 --> 41:21.690
- Listen, Colette um...

41:23.191 --> 41:24.984
I'm really sorry
for what I said.

41:25.026 --> 41:26.695
- No. Don't be.

41:28.196 --> 41:30.198
I've had some time
to reflect on things,

41:32.283 --> 41:35.537
and I've come to realize
you and Amy are right.

41:37.539 --> 41:40.291
Ophelia isn't a piece of art
in my collection,

41:40.333 --> 41:41.876
<i>and it's high time I stopped</i>
<i>treating her like that.</i>

41:43.920 --> 41:47.132
So if she's as talented
as you say she is,

41:47.173 --> 41:49.217
maybe you can help me put
those talents to good use.

41:51.261 --> 41:54.055
- Of course.
We'd be more than happy to.

41:56.850 --> 41:58.935
- I-I hate to ask, but...

41:58.977 --> 42:00.812
is there still a possibility
that you might be willing

42:00.854 --> 42:02.731
to write that review?

42:04.190 --> 42:05.150
- I already did.

42:07.068 --> 42:09.279
- Okay.

42:09.320 --> 42:12.490
<i>(Door opens and shuts,</i>
<i>engine turns)</i>

42:12.532 --> 42:14.701
- What does it say?
- Just give me a second.

42:14.743 --> 42:17.370
<i>(Engine rumbles)</i>

Tim: Okay, we got your message.

42:50.945 --> 42:53.198
What's the big mystery?

42:53.239 --> 42:56.534
- Well, Luke and Katie were
flying the drone around here.

42:56.576 --> 42:58.870
- And they saw something that
you might be interested in.

Champ?!

43:08.421 --> 43:11.424
- Well, I guess
he was so sick of you

43:11.466 --> 43:13.760
he's ran off and joined a gang
of wild horses.
