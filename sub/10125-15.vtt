WEBVTT

00:14.000 --> 00:16.400
NOW, SEE, DANA,
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
SUCH A GREAT KISSER.

00:16.400 --> 00:17.467
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

00:17.467 --> 00:19.934
A LOT OF GIRLS
TRAP BOTH LIPS

00:19.934 --> 00:21.734
IN THIS VACUUMY
SUCTION THING.

00:21.734 --> 00:23.233
THEN YOUR MOUTH
CAVES IN.

00:23.233 --> 00:26.000
YOU'VE GOT TO BREAK
THE SEAL BEFORE
YOUR LUNGS POP.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.867
YOU KNOW AN AWFUL LOT
ABOUT KISSING.

00:28.867 --> 00:31.367
WELL, I'VE DONE SOME
RANDOM SAMPLING,

00:31.367 --> 00:33.600
PURELY FOR
SCIENTIFIC REASONS.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.500
KISSING RESEARCH.

00:35.500 --> 00:37.200
I DON'T MIND IF I DO.

00:42.867 --> 00:45.767
I REALLY LIKE YOU,
DANA PRUETT.

00:45.767 --> 00:48.000
I LIKE YOU, TOO, SHAWN.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.867
SO WHEN'S
OUR SECOND DATE?

00:49.867 --> 00:51.800
I'M VOLUNTEERING
FOR THE BLOOD DRIVE.

00:51.800 --> 00:53.967
WE COULD WORK
THE SIGN-UP BOOTH.

00:53.967 --> 00:55.367
NOT REALLY MY THING.

00:55.367 --> 00:57.100
LIKE MY DAD
ALWAYS SAYS,

00:57.100 --> 01:00.834
"ONLY VOLUNTEER
IF THEY'LL REDUCE
YOUR SENTENCE."

01:00.834 --> 01:04.233
WELL, MAYBE SOMETIME
WE COULD GO ON A PICNIC.

01:04.233 --> 01:06.567
EAT OUTSIDE? WHY?

01:06.567 --> 01:09.033
JUST TWO PEOPLE,
SITTING ON A BLANKET,

01:09.033 --> 01:12.000
REALLY LISTENING TO WHAT
THE OTHER HAS TO SAY.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.200
I LOVE PICNICS.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.500
DO YOU?

01:16.500 --> 01:17.867
NO.

01:17.867 --> 01:19.300
SORRY.

01:19.300 --> 01:22.500
HOW ABOUT WE GET BACK
TO WHAT WE DO BEST?

01:22.500 --> 01:26.000
YOU SURE PUT
A LOT OF EMPHASIS
ON KISSING.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.767
I JUST REALLY LIKE IT.

01:28.767 --> 01:31.734
YEAH, THAT'S
WHAT I'VE HEARD.

01:31.734 --> 01:33.200
UM, SHAWN,

01:33.200 --> 01:35.300
I DON'T THINK A SECOND DATE
IS SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

01:35.300 --> 01:37.500
BUT THANKS FOR TONIGHT.

01:37.500 --> 01:38.800
YOU'RE WELCOME.

01:40.567 --> 01:43.000
WHAT JUST HAPPENED HERE?

01:49.033 --> 01:50.767
SHAWN, NEEDLESS TO SAY,
I'M A LITTLE UPSET.

01:50.767 --> 01:51.934
YOU'RE ALWAYS UPSET.

01:51.934 --> 01:53.667
WELL, MORE THAN USUAL.

01:53.667 --> 01:56.467
THIS MORNING
I'M HAVING BREAKFAST
WITH JANITOR BUD.

01:56.467 --> 01:57.967
JANITOR BUD?

01:57.967 --> 01:59.600
I OWED HIM.

01:59.600 --> 02:02.000
IT COMES UP
THAT LAST NIGHT

02:02.000 --> 02:04.200
YOU WERE OUT
WITH DANA PRUETT?

02:04.200 --> 02:06.233
I WENT OUT
WITH DANA. SO?

02:06.233 --> 02:08.734
SO, FIRST OF ALL,
YOU DON'T TELL ME.

02:08.734 --> 02:11.000
SECOND OF ALL,
SHE'S A VERY NICE GIRL.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.500
YEAH, VERY NICE.

02:12.500 --> 02:15.500
SHAWN, A NICE GIRL LIKE THAT
CAN RUIN YOUR REPUTATION.

02:15.500 --> 02:18.700
I MEAN, JANITOR BUD
AND I WERE SHOCKED.

02:18.700 --> 02:19.834
WOW.

02:19.834 --> 02:22.100
AND BUD'S SEEN
DEAD BODIES.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.233
I'M SAYING.

02:23.233 --> 02:25.033
SO, UH,
WHAT WAS IT LIKE

02:25.033 --> 02:26.900
GOING OUT
WITH A NICE GIRL?

02:26.900 --> 02:29.600
COR, I'M NOT
THE TYPE OF GUY

02:29.600 --> 02:32.000
THAT TALKS
ABOUT THE WOMEN
I GO OUT WITH.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.500
YEAH, YOU ARE.

02:33.500 --> 02:35.934
IF IT WASN'T
FOR YOUR STORIES

02:35.934 --> 02:37.934
AND LITTLE PICTURES
YOU DRAW,

02:37.934 --> 02:39.133
I WOULDN'T KNOW NOTHING.

02:39.133 --> 02:41.734
WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT DANA.

02:41.734 --> 02:43.467
AND DON'T ASK ME
TO DRAW HER.

02:43.467 --> 02:46.967
YOU MUST, UH,
REALLY LIKE THIS GIRL.

02:46.967 --> 02:48.500
I LIKE ALL GIRLS.

02:48.500 --> 02:51.300
AND, SO FAR,
THEY'VE ALL LIKED ME.

02:51.300 --> 02:52.500
MORNING, CORY.

02:52.500 --> 02:53.500
DANA.

02:53.500 --> 02:54.967
UM, SHAWN,
COULD I HAVE

02:54.967 --> 02:56.900
A WORD WITH YOU
IN PRIVATE?

02:56.900 --> 02:58.400
SURE. I'LL BE RIGHT OVER.

02:58.400 --> 03:01.400
OOH, IN PRIVATE--
WHAT COULD THIS BE?

03:01.400 --> 03:04.800
SHE PROBABLY
WANTS TO FINISH WHAT
WE STARTED LAST NIGHT,

03:04.800 --> 03:06.200
SO IF I'M LATE
FOR CLASS,

03:06.200 --> 03:07.934
FALL ASLEEP
WITHOUT ME.

03:10.367 --> 03:11.500
OH, UH, MR. WILLIAMS?

03:11.500 --> 03:14.100
CAN WE TALK ABOUT
MY JOURNALISM PAPER?

03:14.100 --> 03:17.300
ANOTHER EPISODE
OF ERIC MATTHEWS'
EXCUSE THEATER.

03:17.300 --> 03:19.000
ALL RIGHT, LET ME GUESS.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.200
YOU FELL BEHIND
ON YOUR CAR PAYMENTS,

03:22.200 --> 03:24.300
AND THEY REPOSSESSED
YOUR PAPER BY MISTAKE,
HUH?

03:25.734 --> 03:28.133
WAIT. ELI, ELI,
LET ME PLAY.

03:28.133 --> 03:29.133
ALL RIGHT.

03:29.133 --> 03:30.567
UH, O.K. AHEM.

03:30.567 --> 03:32.600
I'M SEEING A PET, RIGHT?

03:32.600 --> 03:34.233
UM, LYING BY A ROAD

03:34.233 --> 03:37.000
WITH YOUR TERM PAPER
IN ITS MOUTH.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.500
HA HA, THAT'S FUNNY.

03:38.500 --> 03:41.200
I'M NOT GOING TO TRY
TO SNOW YOU.

03:41.200 --> 03:42.500
I DESERVE WHAT I GOT,

03:42.500 --> 03:45.200
BUT I'M TRYING
TO GET INTO COLLEGE.

03:45.200 --> 03:46.200
STUDY.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.033
I'M BEING SERIOUS.

03:48.033 --> 03:50.133
WHAT ABOUT THAT
NEWS INTERNSHIP
AT THE STATION?

03:50.133 --> 03:52.600
WHY DON'T YOU LET HIM
APPLY FOR IT?

03:52.600 --> 03:53.600
INTERNSHIP?

03:53.600 --> 03:55.567
YEAH, HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE,
EXTRA CREDIT.

03:55.567 --> 03:57.600
AT A REAL TV STATION?
SIGN ME UP!

03:57.600 --> 03:59.600
WHOA, ERIC. THERE'S ONLY
ONE SPOT AVAILABLE.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.400
THERE'LL BE
A LOT OF COMPETITION.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.400
"A" STUDENTS.
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

04:03.400 --> 04:05.600
YEAH, THEY'RE ALL GOING
TO CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.400
I'M A LOCK!

04:07.400 --> 04:10.300
THANK YOU, MR. WILLIAMS.
GREAT SUGGESTION, MR. TURNER.

04:10.300 --> 04:13.300
GREAT SUGGESTION,
MR. TURNER.

04:13.300 --> 04:15.000
IT CAN'T HURT TO
LET HIM TAKE A SHOT.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.500
THESE PEOPLE ARE
GOING TO SCRUTINIZE
EVERY APPLICATION,

04:17.500 --> 04:19.200
LOOK AT GRADES,
S.A.T. SCORES.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.100
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

04:21.100 --> 04:22.200
IT'S TELEVISION.

04:22.200 --> 04:24.300
HE'S A LOCK.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.734
SO?

04:28.734 --> 04:31.967
COR, I GOT A SURPRISING
LITTLE PROBLEM

04:31.967 --> 04:33.500
WITH THE DANA SITUATION.

04:33.500 --> 04:35.300
SHE WANTS ANOTHER
DATE WITH YOU,

04:35.300 --> 04:36.734
AND YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW TO LET HER DOWN?

04:36.734 --> 04:40.200
SHE WANTS ANOTHER DATE,
BUT WITH ANOTHER GUY.

04:40.200 --> 04:43.233
WELL, IT'S PROBABLY
SOME PUMPED-UP,
PRETTY-BOY JOCK.

04:43.233 --> 04:44.233
YOU KNOW.

04:44.233 --> 04:45.600
IT'S YOU.

04:45.600 --> 04:47.000
HUH.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.400
I WAS RIGHT.

04:51.767 --> 04:53.500
NO, NO, I CAN'T, SHAWN.

04:53.500 --> 04:55.100
YOU ASKED HER OUT FIRST.

04:55.100 --> 04:56.300
NO, NO, NO.

04:56.300 --> 04:57.500
THIS COULD
BE GOOD FOR YOU.

04:57.500 --> 04:58.600
SHE'S GREAT.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.066
FUNNY.

05:00.066 --> 05:01.934
SEXY PENMANSHIP.

05:01.934 --> 05:04.467
DOES SHE HAVE
LITTLE HEARTS
OVER THE Is?

05:04.467 --> 05:05.467
YEAH.

05:05.467 --> 05:06.500
I LOVE THAT.

05:06.500 --> 05:07.700
WHO DOESN'T?

05:07.700 --> 05:09.200
SO, LISTEN, YOU KNOW,

05:09.200 --> 05:11.100
FEEL FREE. GO FOR IT.

05:11.100 --> 05:13.100
ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT THIS?

05:13.100 --> 05:15.967
I'M SURE I'M NOT GOING
TO BE ALONE FOR LONG.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.233
HEY, ROSIE, GEENA!

05:20.600 --> 05:23.133
THESE ARE THE GIRLS
I SHOULD BE DATING.

05:31.834 --> 05:34.767
YES, BUT, MORGAN,
HOW DO WE...REALLY KNOW

05:34.767 --> 05:36.300
THAT THE LIGHT BULB
GOES OUT

05:36.300 --> 05:38.700
WHEN YOU CLOSE
THE DOOR?

05:38.700 --> 05:41.800
WHY DON'T YOU
GET IN THERE
AND FIND OUT?

05:41.800 --> 05:43.867
MORGAN,
TIME FOR BED.

05:43.867 --> 05:46.567
I CAN'T.
I'M BABYSITTING SHAWN.

05:46.567 --> 05:49.467
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
IN THIS HOUSE
WITH THEIR OWN BEDROOM.

05:49.467 --> 05:50.834
WHY DON'T YOU
EVER USE IT?

05:50.834 --> 05:52.600
'CAUSE LIFE IS SHORT.

05:52.600 --> 05:53.834
SO ARE YOU.

05:53.834 --> 05:55.133
GO TO BED.

05:57.300 --> 05:59.500
UH, SHAWN, I DON'T
KNOW IF YOU'RE AWARE,

05:59.500 --> 06:02.600
BUT CORY, WHO'S ACTUALLY
RELATED TO US,

06:02.600 --> 06:04.000
LEFT AFTER DINNER,

06:04.000 --> 06:07.700
SO WE WOULDN'T
BE OFFENDED
IF YOU DID THE SAME.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.200
THANKS, BUT I'M FINE.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.500
I'VE WAITED THREE HOURS.

06:11.500 --> 06:12.867
I CAN WAIT
A COUPLE MORE MINUTES

06:12.867 --> 06:15.233
FOR CORY TO COME BACK
FROM HIS DATE.

06:15.233 --> 06:18.200
HE'LL WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT,
BUDDY TO BUDDY.

06:18.200 --> 06:20.967
WELL, THEN,
WE'LL JUST, UH,
GO TO SLEEP...

06:20.967 --> 06:23.100
BUDDY TO BUDDY.

06:23.100 --> 06:26.100
WHY DON'T WE ADOPT HIM,
GET THE TAX DEDUCTION?

06:27.834 --> 06:28.800
[DOOR OPENS]

06:29.900 --> 06:30.900
HELLO.

06:30.900 --> 06:33.033
YOU COME WALTZING
IN HERE AFTER 9:00,

06:33.033 --> 06:34.400
AND ALL I GET
IS HELLO?

06:35.934 --> 06:37.500
HELLO...

06:37.500 --> 06:39.100
SAILOR?

06:39.100 --> 06:40.734
BETTER.

06:40.734 --> 06:41.867
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

06:41.867 --> 06:45.500
SURE, MAKE ME OUT
TO BE THE BAD GUY.

06:45.500 --> 06:48.000
JUST BECAUSE
MY MOM SERVED US

06:48.000 --> 06:49.700
MAYBE THE DRIEST
TURKEY EVER,

06:49.700 --> 06:51.667
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU HAVE TO
GET MAD AT ME.

06:51.667 --> 06:54.033
IT'S NOT ABOUT
THE STINKING TURKEY,

06:54.033 --> 06:56.600
WHICH I'M STILL CHEWING,
BY THE WAY.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.200
HOW WAS YOUR DATE
WITH DANA?

06:58.200 --> 07:00.500
IT WAS A DATE.

07:00.500 --> 07:02.367
I GIVE YOU
MORE THAN THAT.

07:02.367 --> 07:04.300
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW
IF I KISSED HER,

07:04.300 --> 07:05.367
THE ANSWER'S NO.

07:07.567 --> 07:09.300
WELL, THAT--THAT--
THAT'S O.K.

07:09.300 --> 07:12.100
SO, UH, SO DO
YOU LIKE HER?

07:12.100 --> 07:13.967
YEAH, SHE'S FINE.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.867
ON A SCALE OF 1-10,

07:15.867 --> 07:17.834
HOW MUCH DO YOU LIKE
DANA PRUETT?

07:17.834 --> 07:19.600
10 BEING TOPANGA
ON YOUR FIRST DATE

07:19.600 --> 07:22.400
AND 1 BEING
THE LUNCHROOM LADY
IN A THONG.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.500
7.

07:23.500 --> 07:26.767
GOOD. NOW ON A SCALE
OF 1-10--

07:26.767 --> 07:28.000
WAIT A MINUTE.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.900
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
ACT LIKE THIS.

07:29.900 --> 07:31.300
ARE YOU FLUEY?

07:31.300 --> 07:33.967
A LITTLE TICKLE,
BUT I DON'T THINK
THAT'S IT.

07:33.967 --> 07:37.867
I THINK YOU'RE COMING DOWN
WITH A BAD CASE OF DANA.

07:37.867 --> 07:40.200
I--I DON'T KNOW, COR.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.200
ALL I KNOW

07:41.200 --> 07:43.734
IS THAT ALL THROUGH
THE DRY TURKEY,

07:43.734 --> 07:46.033
KNOWING YOU WERE
GOING OUT WITH DANA,

07:46.033 --> 07:49.400
I KEPT JUST WANTING TO
TAKE THE CARVING KNIFE

07:49.400 --> 07:51.300
AND STAB YOU
IN THE HEAD.

07:53.233 --> 07:54.400
NO OFFENSE!

07:57.834 --> 08:01.033
UM--UM, GOOD.
I'M STILL HERE.

08:01.033 --> 08:03.400
SO IT'S O.K.
IF I ASK HER OUT?

08:03.400 --> 08:04.900
I'LL STAB YOU
IN THE HEAD
IF YOU DON'T.

08:04.900 --> 08:07.233
YOU'RE GOOD PEOPLE.

08:09.767 --> 08:10.800
HEY, ARTIE.

08:10.800 --> 08:11.800
IT'S...

08:11.800 --> 08:13.000
ARTHUR.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
YOU'RE UP FOR
THE SAME INTERNSHIP.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.100
ERIC, I WANT TO SAVE YOU
THE EMBARRASSMENT.

08:19.100 --> 08:20.467
I'M A STRAIGHT-A
STUDENT,

08:20.467 --> 08:21.967
MY DOCUMENTARIES

08:23.300 --> 08:26.233
AND I HAVE A LETTER
OF RECOMMENDATION

08:26.233 --> 08:27.867
FROM TED TURNER.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.367
YOUR POINT?

08:30.367 --> 08:33.934
I CAN WALK IN
WITHOUT PANTS
AND GET THIS JOB.

08:35.800 --> 08:38.100
I'VE SEEN YOU
IN GYM CLASS, ARTHUR.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.367
WEAR PANTS.

08:44.200 --> 08:45.100
HIYA, SHAWN.

08:45.100 --> 08:46.500
DANA, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

08:46.500 --> 08:48.100
YOU'RE SIGNING UP
FOR THE BLOOD DRIVE?

08:48.100 --> 08:51.000
WAY AHEAD OF YOU.
BLOOD.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.500
WHERE'D YOU
GET THIS?

08:52.500 --> 08:54.600
I WENT TO MY
UNCLE LOUIE'S
BUTCHER SHOP.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.200
SHAWN, WE'RE
COLLECTING HUMAN BLOOD.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.300
IT'S HUMAN.

08:58.300 --> 08:59.900
NO, NO, FROM HIS ARMS.

08:59.900 --> 09:01.400
HE GIVES ALL THE TIME.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.300
HE DIDN'T KNOW
I TOOK IT.

09:03.300 --> 09:05.934
THANKS FOR
THINKING OF ME.

09:05.934 --> 09:08.600
THERE'S A COUPLE
PORK CHOPS FOR YOU, TOO.

09:08.600 --> 09:12.900
GREAT. GIVES ME
A HEAD START ON
THE PORK CHOP DRIVE.

09:15.400 --> 09:18.400
IT'S NICE
BEING HERE TALKING,
ISN'T IT?

09:18.400 --> 09:21.367
I COULD BE HAPPY
TALKING TO YOU ALL DAY.

09:21.367 --> 09:22.934
WHAT WOULD WE
TALK ABOUT?

09:22.934 --> 09:24.467
UM...

09:24.467 --> 09:25.700
I...

09:25.700 --> 09:27.834
HOW WAS YOUR DATE
WITH CORY?

09:27.834 --> 09:29.567
WE HAD THE BEST TIME.

09:29.567 --> 09:30.700
HE'S SO SWEET.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.700
REALLY? THAT'S COOL.

09:32.700 --> 09:35.734
CORY TOLD ME
HE HAD A GOOD TIME, TOO.

09:37.100 --> 09:38.800
SO, WHY DIDN'T YOU
KISS HIM?

09:38.800 --> 09:40.800
WELL, IT WAS
A FIRST DATE.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.100
WHY RUSH THINGS?

09:42.100 --> 09:44.600
YOU KISSED ME
ON THE FIRST DATE.

09:44.600 --> 09:47.400
YEAH, BUT IT'S
DIFFERENT WITH YOU.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.133
HOW AM I DIFFERENT
FROM CORY?

09:49.133 --> 09:52.567
HONESTLY?

09:52.567 --> 09:53.834
CORY'S THE TYPE OF GUY

09:53.834 --> 09:55.467
THAT COULD TURN
INTO A BOYFRIEND.

09:55.467 --> 09:57.000
YOU'RE REAL CUTE
AND EVERYTHING,

09:57.000 --> 09:59.300
BUT FACE IT,
WITH YOUR REPUTATION,

09:59.300 --> 10:00.400
YOU'RE JUST...

10:00.400 --> 10:02.767
WHAT? YOU CAN TELL ME.

10:02.767 --> 10:06.233
YOU'RE NOT
BOYFRIEND MATERIAL.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.934
SO SHE REALLY SAID

10:15.934 --> 10:17.233
YOU'RE NOT
BOYFRIEND MATERIAL?

10:17.233 --> 10:20.133
I REALLY LIKED HER.

10:20.133 --> 10:23.000
I'M SURPRISED,
'CAUSE SHE SEEMS
LIKE THE TYPE OF GIRL

10:23.000 --> 10:24.400
THAT'D END UP WITH ME.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.800
I CAN'T END UP
WITH NICE GIRLS?

10:26.800 --> 10:29.000
NO, CALM DOWN.
I'D LOVE TO GO OUT

10:29.000 --> 10:32.033
WITH SOME
OF THE GIRLS
YOU GO OUT WITH.

10:32.033 --> 10:35.100
BUT I CAN'T,
'CAUSE I'M STUCK
BEING THE NICE GUY.

10:35.100 --> 10:37.133
ALL THOSE GIRLS
WANT FROM ME IS...

10:37.133 --> 10:38.300
DIRECTIONS TO YOU.

10:38.300 --> 10:40.300
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"THOSE GIRLS"?

10:40.300 --> 10:41.400
YOU KNOW...

10:41.400 --> 10:42.467
SEXY,

10:42.467 --> 10:43.467
HOT,

10:43.467 --> 10:44.734
FLASHY...

10:44.734 --> 10:47.500
THE KIND OF GIRLS
I'VE NEVER DATED
IN MY LIFE.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.500
EXCEPT ONE TIME.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.033
HELLO, FLASHY.

10:53.033 --> 10:56.200
I'M HAPPY
TO BE THOUGHT OF
AS A NICE GIRL.

10:56.200 --> 10:57.800
YEAH, YEAH,
NICE GIRL.

10:57.800 --> 10:59.233
HAVE A SEAT.

10:59.233 --> 11:00.500
SHAWN,

11:00.500 --> 11:02.300
IF THIS HAS
ANYTHING TO DO
WITH DANA PRUETT,

11:02.300 --> 11:03.867
I DON'T HAVE
ALL THE INFORMATION.

11:03.867 --> 11:07.000
I'VE ONLY BEEN
IN THE BATHROOM
THREE TIMES TODAY.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.100
TOPANGA, AS THE HOTTEST
AND FLASHIEST GIRL

11:10.100 --> 11:11.667
OF THE NICE GIRL CAMP,

11:11.667 --> 11:14.934
WOULD YOU EVER CONSIDER
GOING OUT WITH SHAWN?

11:14.934 --> 11:16.934
WELL, HE'D
HAVE TO ASK ME.

11:16.934 --> 11:19.867
TOPANGA, WOULD YOU
EVER CONSIDER
GOING OUT WITH ME?

11:19.867 --> 11:21.500
NO.

11:21.500 --> 11:23.300
WHY NOT?

11:23.300 --> 11:24.300
THE TRUTH?

11:24.300 --> 11:25.233
YEAH.

11:25.233 --> 11:26.500
YOU COULDN'T
HANDLE IT.

11:26.500 --> 11:27.700
I COULD.

11:27.700 --> 11:28.867
HE COULD.

11:28.867 --> 11:30.567
NO, HE COULDN'T.

11:30.567 --> 11:33.000
YOU'LL TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR HOW HE FEELS?

11:33.000 --> 11:35.033
ABSOLUTELY.

11:36.133 --> 11:37.767
YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND WOMEN--

11:37.767 --> 11:40.934
WHAT WE ARE,
HOW WE FEEL,
WHAT WE THINK.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.700
YOU SEE US
AS DATING OBJECTS.

11:42.700 --> 11:44.467
THE FASTER WE ARE,
THE MORE YOU WANT US.

11:44.467 --> 11:46.233
UNTIL YOU SEE
BEYOND THAT,

11:46.233 --> 11:49.600
YOU WILL ALWAYS
BE LONELY.

11:56.200 --> 11:58.300
YOU LET HER
SAY THAT TO ME?

11:58.300 --> 12:00.200
SHE'S LYING.

12:00.200 --> 12:02.734
YOU GO FROM
GIRL TO GIRL.

12:02.734 --> 12:04.033
THAT MAKES ANYONE

12:04.033 --> 12:06.400
WHO'D CONSIDER
A RELATIONSHIP
WITH YOU AFRAID.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.500
AFRAID OF WHAT?
OF GETTING HURT.

12:08.500 --> 12:11.600
GIRLS THINK
YOU'LL GET BORED
AND MOVE ON.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.800
WOW.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.300
THEY KNOW.

12:18.100 --> 12:20.033
ARTHUR, THANKS
FOR COMING DOWN.

12:20.033 --> 12:22.233
VERY IMPRESSIVE.
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER

12:22.233 --> 12:25.400
TO OFFER YOU
THE INTERN JOB
OR MY JOB.

12:25.400 --> 12:26.600
THAT'S QUITE
A COMPLIMENT.

12:26.600 --> 12:27.800
IT WOULD BE AN HONOR

12:27.800 --> 12:31.467
TO WORK WITH
A NEWS DIRECTOR
OF YOUR CALIBER.

12:31.467 --> 12:33.367
AND YOU HAVE MY RÉSUMÉ.

12:33.367 --> 12:36.600
I'LL FINISH IT
OVER THE WEEKEND.

12:36.600 --> 12:39.500
"BOX BOY AT DADDY'S STORE."

12:39.500 --> 12:42.867
<i>HEAD </i>BOX BOY.

12:42.867 --> 12:44.200
WHAT IF THEY CHECK?

12:49.033 --> 12:50.100
ERIC.

12:50.100 --> 12:51.367
ARTHUR.

12:51.367 --> 12:52.767
UM, EXCUSE ME, MA'AM,

12:52.767 --> 12:54.934
I BELIEVE I HAVE
AN INTERVIEW.

12:54.934 --> 12:55.934
YOU ARE?

12:55.934 --> 12:57.133
ERIC MATTHEWS.

12:57.133 --> 12:59.567
THERE REALLY IS
AN ERIC MATTHEWS?

12:59.567 --> 13:03.233
SO THAT RÉSUMÉ
THAT ELI SENT OVER
WASN'T A J--

13:03.233 --> 13:05.000
COME ON IN ANYWAY.

13:06.567 --> 13:07.600
AND SO...

13:07.600 --> 13:10.934
HAD PRESS COVERAGE
INTO THE PRIVATE LIVES

13:10.934 --> 13:13.000
OF PAST POLITICIANS

13:13.000 --> 13:16.233
BEEN AS INVASIVE
AS IT IS TODAY,

13:16.233 --> 13:18.800
SUCH MEN AS
FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT,

13:18.800 --> 13:19.834
JOHN KENNEDY,

13:19.834 --> 13:23.000
MIGHT NEVER HAVE BEEN
ELECTED PRESIDENT.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.934
MR. FEENY, WOULD YOU
CONSIDER JOHN KENNEDY

13:25.934 --> 13:27.667
A GREAT PRESIDENT?

13:27.667 --> 13:30.400
WELL, HIS TIME
IN OFFICE WAS SHORT,

13:30.400 --> 13:32.900
BUT, YES,
HE ACCOMPLISHED
A GREAT DEAL.

13:32.900 --> 13:34.800
DID THE FACT THAT HE
WAS A BABE MAGNET

13:34.800 --> 13:36.667
MAKE HIM LESS GREAT?

13:36.667 --> 13:39.000
IN MANY PEOPLE'S EYES,
IT DID.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.400
LESS OF A HUSBAND,
LESS OF A LEADER.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.000
[GIRLS]
YEAH.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.934
WELL...I THINK WE'VE
HEARD FROM THE WOMEN.

13:45.934 --> 13:47.467
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
MR. HUNTER?

13:47.467 --> 13:51.100
IT'S NOT EASY
FOR A GUY TO CHANGE
WHO HE IS.

13:51.100 --> 13:52.200
[BOYS]
YEAH.

13:52.200 --> 13:54.200
WHOA, WHOA,
STEADY, STEADY.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.300
YOU CAN'T CHANGE
IF YOU DON'T TRY.

13:56.300 --> 13:59.500
I CAN'T TRY
UNLESS YOU
GIVE ME A CHANCE.

13:59.500 --> 14:01.300
MR. HUNTER,
YOU'VE SPURRED A DEBATE.

14:01.300 --> 14:02.400
YEAH, FINE.

14:02.400 --> 14:03.667
WHEN'S DETENTION?

14:05.400 --> 14:07.600
NO, NO, NO.
IT'S A GOOD THING.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.300
I LIKE TO HEAR
YOUR OPINIONS.

14:09.300 --> 14:10.734
I'D LIKE TO HEAR
EVERYONE'S--

14:10.734 --> 14:14.367
IN AN ESSAY DUE TOMORROW.

14:14.367 --> 14:15.967
OH, MAN!
OHH!
GEE!

14:15.967 --> 14:18.500
[BELL RINGS]

14:18.500 --> 14:20.400
WAY TO GO, SHAWN.

14:20.400 --> 14:21.600
THANKS A LOT.

14:29.500 --> 14:30.734
YOU KNOW, MISS CANNON,

14:30.734 --> 14:32.600
YOUR OFFICE IS
MIGHTY, MIGHTY HOT.

14:32.600 --> 14:35.400
IT WAS MIGHTY, MIGHTY
NICE TO MEET YOU.

14:35.400 --> 14:38.600
I'M NOT GOING TO GET
THIS INTERNSHIP, AM I?

14:38.600 --> 14:40.767
WELL, EVERYONE
HAS A CHANCE.

14:40.767 --> 14:41.734
REALLY?

14:43.700 --> 14:45.000
DON'T DO THIS TO ME.

14:51.133 --> 14:52.300
THIS JUST IN.

14:52.300 --> 14:54.934
ERIC MATTHEWS
IS A HUGE LOSER.

14:54.934 --> 14:56.100
WHY IS HE A LOSER?

14:56.100 --> 14:58.033
I DIDN'T KNOW
ANYBODY WAS HERE.

14:58.033 --> 15:01.600
I'LL GET OUT OF YOUR WAY
AND LET YOU CLEAN.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.900
I GOT PLENTY OF TIME
TO CLEAN.

15:06.934 --> 15:10.033
WERE YOU HERE FOR
THE, UH, INTERNSHIP?

15:10.033 --> 15:11.033
YEP.

15:11.033 --> 15:12.400
AND I BLEW IT.

15:12.400 --> 15:15.000
OHH. HOW DO YOU KNOW?

15:15.000 --> 15:16.467
'CAUSE I WASN'T
MYSELF.

15:16.467 --> 15:18.700
MAN, I REALLY
WANTED THIS JOB.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.200
WHY?

15:20.200 --> 15:23.000
WHAT COULD BE
MORE EXCITING
THAN WORKING IN TV?

15:23.000 --> 15:25.600
ALL THOSE
STRAIGHT-A GUYS WANT

15:25.600 --> 15:28.033
IS SOMETHING TO PUT
ON THEIR RÉSUMÉ.

15:28.033 --> 15:29.200
THEY DON'T
GET IT HERE,

15:29.200 --> 15:30.600
THEY'LL GET IT
SOMEPLACE ELSE,

15:30.600 --> 15:32.734
BUT THIS IS
EVERYTHING TO ME.

15:32.734 --> 15:34.900
MISS CANNON
DOESN'T KNOW THIS,

15:34.900 --> 15:36.867
BUT I'D DO THAT JOB
BETTER THAN
ANY OF THEM

15:36.867 --> 15:39.400
BECAUSE I
NEED IT MORE.

15:39.400 --> 15:41.867
DID YOU TELL HER THAT?

15:41.867 --> 15:43.300
NO, I WAS TOO BUSY
CHOKING.

15:43.300 --> 15:48.100
I CHOKED IN FRONT
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
PERSON HERE.

15:48.100 --> 15:49.734
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

15:49.734 --> 15:50.867
YEAH, I DID.

15:50.867 --> 15:54.467
I WAS SWEATING SO MUCH,
MY SHOES SQUISHED.

15:54.467 --> 15:56.300
NO...

15:56.300 --> 15:57.667
NO, I MEANT...

15:57.667 --> 16:00.900
SHE'S NOT THE MOST
IMPORTANT PERSON
AT THE STATION.

16:00.900 --> 16:02.600
I AM.

16:02.600 --> 16:03.934
HEY, PAL,

16:03.934 --> 16:05.000
I KNOW COFFEE'S
REALLY IMPORTANT

16:05.000 --> 16:06.500
AND EVERYTHING,
BUT...

16:06.500 --> 16:08.400
PAT DARBY,
STATION MANAGER.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.400
WHERE?

16:09.400 --> 16:10.734
RIGHT HERE.

16:10.734 --> 16:12.367
SHAKING THE HAND
OF OUR NEW INTERN.

16:12.367 --> 16:13.867
I'LL SEE YOU MONDAY.

16:13.867 --> 16:15.734
BE YOURSELF
OR I'LL FIRE YOU.

16:15.734 --> 16:18.400
OH, OH, OH,
YES, SIR.

16:18.400 --> 16:19.400
THANK YOU
SO MUCH, SIR.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.934
THANK YOU.
I'LL BE HERE.

16:21.934 --> 16:23.300
ONE THING REAL QUICK.

16:23.300 --> 16:25.300
BEFORE I TELL MY PARENTS,

16:25.300 --> 16:28.000
DO YOU HAVE
A BUSINESS CARD
AND A PHOTO I.D.?

16:33.300 --> 16:36.400
SHAWN, DON'T LET
WHAT TOPANGA SAID
BOTHER YOU.

16:36.400 --> 16:39.200
IF I LISTENED
TO EVERYTHING
TOPANGA TOLD ME--

16:39.200 --> 16:42.000
YOU GUYS WOULD
STILL BE TOGETHER.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
THEN WHAT ARE YOU
LISTENING TO ME FOR?

16:45.000 --> 16:46.300
MR. TURNER,

16:46.300 --> 16:47.834
SEE WHAT YOU
CAN DO WITH THIS.

16:47.834 --> 16:49.200
WANT TO
FILL ME IN?

16:49.200 --> 16:51.400
YEAH. DANA PRUETT--
NICE GIRL.

16:51.400 --> 16:53.400
SHAWN HUNTER.
OH.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.600
YOU'RE UP TO SPEED.
MY WORK IS DONE.

16:55.600 --> 16:58.367
I'M GOING BACK OUT
IN THE BLIZZARD

16:58.367 --> 16:59.900
WITH ONE MITTEN.

16:59.900 --> 17:01.100
GODSPEED TO ME.

17:03.467 --> 17:06.900
HEY, SHAWN, YOU O.K.?

17:06.900 --> 17:08.734
I REALLY LIKE DANA,
JOHN,

17:08.734 --> 17:10.400
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT SHE LIKES ME.

17:10.400 --> 17:13.500
BUT SHE'S AFRAID
TO GET INVOLVED WITH ME.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.467
THE HUNTER
REPUTATION, HUH?

17:15.467 --> 17:18.100
I USED TO BE
SO PROUD OF IT.

17:18.100 --> 17:20.467
WOW, THE ONLY THING
YOU'VE EVER WORKED ON

17:20.467 --> 17:22.500
BLOWS UP IN YOUR FACE.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.667
I LOST MY OTHER MITTEN.

17:25.734 --> 17:26.967
ISN'T THAT SOMETHING?

17:26.967 --> 17:29.900
DON'T MIND ME.
I'LL JUST LOOK.

17:29.900 --> 17:31.600
WHAT WAS I THINKING

17:31.600 --> 17:33.834
ASKING OUT A GIRL
LIKE DANA PRUETT?

17:33.834 --> 17:34.867
BECAUSE YOU LIKED HER.

17:34.867 --> 17:37.367
OBVIOUSLY SHE MEANT
SOMETHING TO YOU.

17:37.367 --> 17:38.500
BUT WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

17:38.500 --> 17:40.300
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHERE I BELONG--

17:40.300 --> 17:43.700
BACK WITH ALL THOSE
FAST, FLASHY GIRLS.

17:43.700 --> 17:45.600
IT WAS BLUE, FUZZY.

17:50.667 --> 17:52.967
YOU KNOW, SHAWN,
IT SEEMS TO ME

17:52.967 --> 17:55.867
THE PEOPLE YOU
CARE MOST ABOUT
IN THE WORLD

17:55.867 --> 17:57.600
AREN'T FAST
AND FLASHY.

17:57.600 --> 17:58.767
HEY, LOOK.

17:58.767 --> 18:01.400
IT'S THE SCARF I LOST
LAST YEAR. YES.

18:04.400 --> 18:06.400
YOU MEAN CORY,
DON'T YOU?

18:06.400 --> 18:07.567
YOU THINK?

18:07.567 --> 18:09.400
SEE THIS GUY
RIGHT HERE?

18:09.400 --> 18:11.200
THIS IS YOUR
BEST RELATIONSHIP.

18:11.200 --> 18:12.800
YOU GUYS LISTEN
TO EACH OTHER,

18:12.800 --> 18:14.967
AND YOU REALLY
TRUST EACH OTHER.

18:14.967 --> 18:16.800
THAT'S WHAT GIRLS
ARE LOOKING FOR?

18:16.800 --> 18:17.900
OH, YEAH.

18:17.900 --> 18:19.967
ESPECIALLY
THE NICE ONES.

18:19.967 --> 18:22.033
THAT'S FUNNY,
'CAUSE DANA'S
THE ONLY GIRL

18:22.033 --> 18:23.867
I'VE EVER REALLY
LISTENED TO.

18:23.867 --> 18:25.100
DOES SHE KNOW?

18:25.100 --> 18:26.200
I CAN TELL HER.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.934
DO BETTER.
SHOW HER.

18:29.967 --> 18:32.934
I HAD IT THE WHOLE TIME.

18:32.934 --> 18:35.734
YOU GOT TO
LOVE VELCRO, HUH?

18:41.367 --> 18:42.900
HI, CORY.

18:42.900 --> 18:44.900
DANA.

18:44.900 --> 18:47.000
YOU'RE PLAYING
POOL ALONE?

18:47.000 --> 18:50.033
WELL, NORMALLY
I'D BE PLAYING
WITH MY BEST FRIEND,

18:50.033 --> 18:52.300
BUT HE'S OFF,
WHO KNOWS WHERE,
MOPING

18:52.300 --> 18:56.100
BECAUSE SOME GIRL
PLAYED YO-YO
WITH HIS FEELINGS.

18:56.100 --> 18:58.033
YOU KNOW WHAT
HIS REPUTATION IS.

18:58.033 --> 18:59.500
I KNOW
HIS REPUTATION,

18:59.500 --> 19:01.033
BUT I ALSO
KNOW THE GUY.

19:01.033 --> 19:03.367
WHAT'S MORE
IMPORTANT, DANA,

19:03.367 --> 19:04.900
THE REPUTATION
OR THE GUY?

19:06.300 --> 19:08.767
YOU WENT OUT WITH ME
BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT
I WAS NICE.

19:08.767 --> 19:10.100
THAT'S
MY REPUTATION.

19:10.100 --> 19:11.767
NOW YOU KNOW,
DEEP DOWN,

19:11.767 --> 19:15.300
CORY MATTHEWS
IS DANGEROUS, DARK,

19:15.300 --> 19:16.834
AND VERY EDGY.

19:16.834 --> 19:18.133
<i>Would the owner</i>

19:18.133 --> 19:20.100

OH, I GOT TO GO.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.867
SHAWN?

19:33.867 --> 19:35.734
THIS SEEMED LIKE
A LOT BETTER IDEA

19:35.734 --> 19:38.033
BEFORE
MY LIPS FROZE.

19:38.033 --> 19:39.934
ARE YOU CRAZY?
IT'S WINTER.

19:39.934 --> 19:42.200
IT'S ONLY COLD
FOR THE FIRST
HOUR OR SO.

19:42.200 --> 19:44.233
THEN THE NUMBNESS
KICKS IN.

19:44.233 --> 19:45.900
YOU CAN'T REALLY
FEEL ANYTHING.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.200
YOU WANT
SOME HOT SOUP?

19:51.900 --> 19:52.667
SHAWN...

19:52.667 --> 19:54.667
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:54.667 --> 19:57.300
I REMEMBERED YOU SAID
YOU LIKE PICNICS,

19:57.300 --> 19:59.900
SO I FIGURED
WHY WAIT TILL SPRING?

19:59.900 --> 20:02.667
BESIDES, DID YOU KNOW
THAT IN WINTER,

20:02.667 --> 20:05.567
PICNIC BASKETS
ARE, LIKE,
A MILLION PERCENT OFF?

20:05.567 --> 20:08.734
YOU MEAN, YOU WERE
ACTUALLY LISTENING
TO WHAT I SAID?

20:08.734 --> 20:10.934
LOOK, DANA...

20:10.934 --> 20:12.100
UM...

20:12.100 --> 20:14.100
YOU SAY I'M NOT
BOYFRIEND MATERIAL,

20:14.100 --> 20:15.667
AND MAYBE I'M NOT,

20:15.667 --> 20:18.867
BUT WHY WON'T
YOU GIVE ME
A CHANCE TO TRY?

20:18.867 --> 20:20.500
BECAUSE...

20:20.500 --> 20:23.000
I'M AFRAID OF YOU, O.K.?

20:23.000 --> 20:25.300
MAYBE YOU CAN'T
UNDERSTAND THAT,

20:25.300 --> 20:27.000
BUT I'M AFRAID OF YOU.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.600
NO, I CAN
UNDERSTAND THAT.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.300
I'M AFRAID OF YOU.

20:31.300 --> 20:32.867
OF ME?

20:32.867 --> 20:35.100
YEAH, AND IT'S
NOT EVEN I LOVE YOU
OR ANYTHING.

20:35.100 --> 20:38.133
I JUST LIKE YOU
AND WANT TO BE
WITH YOU.

20:38.133 --> 20:41.467
I'VE NEVER
FELT THAT WAY
ABOUT A GIRL BEFORE,

20:41.467 --> 20:44.900
AND, YOU KNOW,
IT--IT SCARES ME.

20:46.100 --> 20:49.567
COME ON,
LET'S GET YOU INSIDE.

20:50.934 --> 20:52.734
NO. SEE, I...

20:52.734 --> 20:54.667
I WANT TO BE
OUT HERE WITH YOU.

20:54.667 --> 20:57.200
I WANT
A SECOND DATE.

20:57.200 --> 21:00.834
I WANT TO
SEE YOU AGAIN, TOO.

21:01.967 --> 21:03.400
YEAH, DO YOU
MEAN THAT?

21:03.400 --> 21:04.934
YEAH.

21:04.934 --> 21:09.100
YOU WANT TO SEAL IT
WITH A KISS?

21:10.667 --> 21:12.834
WHAT'S OUR RUSH?

21:28.500 --> 21:30.600
REMEMBER, MORGAN,
DECAF ONES

21:30.600 --> 21:31.967

21:31.967 --> 21:33.000

I'M NOT FOLLOWING YOU.

21:55.033 --> 21:57.667
PART OF MY JOB DESCRIPTION
IS TO GET THE CREW COFFEE.

21:57.667 --> 22:01.967
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
BRING IT FROM HOME.

22:01.967 --> 22:04.300
