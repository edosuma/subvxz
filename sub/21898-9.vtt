Well, then stop them.
Close the schools.

they will shift plans,

36:44.536 --> 36:47.973

advantage that we have.

36:53.612 --> 36:55.414
In order to cut
the head off this cell,

36:55.447 --> 36:58.484
we have to catch you attempting
to commit an act of terrorism,

36:58.517 --> 37:00.319

a Dex. How could I--

37:06.024 --> 37:08.394
Your mom took it. She could
easily have given it back,

37:08.427 --> 37:09.828

37:11.863 --> 37:14.266
We have to control
an attack ourselves

38:05.751 --> 38:07.553
I was up all night
last night,

38:07.586 --> 38:09.321
and I realize
it's a bad idea

38:09.355 --> 38:11.923
to be less present and
overbearing. It's a bad combo.

38:11.957 --> 38:14.793

But I'm just worried
that you're too young

38:24.836 --> 38:27.539
to understand
exactly what you're giving up.

38:27.573 --> 38:31.410
I mean, you are
trading independence

38:31.443 --> 38:33.912

that you don't need.

38:33.945 --> 38:36.047
I mean, look at the news
the other day.

38:36.081 --> 38:38.884
The news about the
terrorist attack at the border.

38:38.917 --> 38:40.952

somebody probably crossed

38:40.986 --> 38:42.721
with a letter opener
in their purse,

38:42.754 --> 38:44.923
and then it becomes a knife,
and then it becomes a gun,

38:44.956 --> 38:48.394
and then, a month later,
the official report comes out,

38:48.427 --> 38:49.995
and they've caught
a bunch of insurgents

38:50.028 --> 38:52.130

blowing up the whole world.

38:52.163 --> 38:54.366
And they hate people like me

38:54.400 --> 38:56.668

on their lies,

tell you something.

Okay, but I have a point,

that

39:10.649 --> 39:13.852

are worth fighting for,
