Yep.
Well, I need something.

02:05.040 --> 02:07.880
It's really stinging.
You should wee on it.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.640
(LAUGHS) I don't think I
could manage the angle.

02:10.680 --> 02:13.680
I could. No, thanks.
It's fine.

02:13.720 --> 02:17.200
Oh, go on, give us a shot.
I don't want you to wee on me.

02:19.600 --> 02:22.000
So, what do you want
for your birthday?

02:22.040 --> 02:24.240
To not be having another birthday.

02:24.280 --> 02:26.520
All right, gotta go.
I've got to be at work by eight.

02:26.560 --> 02:28.920
Oh, I thought you had the day off
today. Yeah, that turned into

02:28.960 --> 02:31.120
a half day off. Happy birthday me!

02:32.160 --> 02:34.560
Mm.
Bye. Bye.

Happy birthday, Mum. Thanks.

to retire now, right?

02:59.920 --> 03:03.440
There's no way they can cope without
me. I can't even get a full day off.

03:03.480 --> 03:05.560
And is Dad spoiling you?

03:05.600 --> 03:09.240
Oh, he will, don't you worry.
Oh, it's just started snowing here.

03:09.280 --> 03:11.560
London is so amazing.
I can't believe I had

03:11.600 --> 03:14.400
to grow up in Australia.
Thanks, Dad.

03:14.440 --> 03:18.400
Oh, Mum, hey, sorry, I've got to go.
Oh. But have a great birthday.

03:18.440 --> 03:20.640
Already? Oh.
Love you.

03:20.680 --> 03:22.800
Bye, Dad.
Bye, honey.

03:22.840 --> 03:26.120
She seems happy. I hope that
doesn't mean she's gonna stay.
Of course she's happy.

03:26.160 --> 03:28.200
She's having a great time
ignoring her studies.

03:28.240 --> 03:30.240
Just stop that, please.

03:30.280 --> 03:33.240

due to finish at lunch time today,

Did you get your driver's licence

05:52.960 --> 05:54.960
on the dark net?

05:57.760 --> 06:00.000
You're really gonna have to learn
how to reverse in here.

06:00.040 --> 06:02.560
I don't like reversing.
It's easy. It's like going forwards,

06:02.600 --> 06:04.800
except backwards.
Can't even do that.

06:04.840 --> 06:07.920
We've been waiting for
someone to show up.

06:07.960 --> 06:11.360

my colleague left behind.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.720

I'm actually on a bit of a -

06:17.440 --> 06:19.440
well, it's a diet box.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.280

Kinda chewy in the middle,

06:22.320 --> 06:24.520
but just the right amount
of bite in the bite.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.160

collect the paperwork.

you're missing out on.

you're talking about.

Well, I can see it. It's just -
Oh, you're the one

06:37.000 --> 06:39.080
that's gonna shut us down.

06:39.120 --> 06:41.160
Oh, no. I just do the organising

06:41.200 --> 06:43.200
and the things that other
people forget to do

06:43.240 --> 06:46.200
like bringing such paperwork
back to the office.

we're all out.

have the paperwork,

anything.

of you to think of me.

gonna give it to one of the others,

16:50.320 --> 16:52.320

Why? Why me?

Uh, hi. I think I left the speaker.

17:28.040 --> 17:30.760
The bastards wanna charge me
200 bucks for what's like a...

17:30.800 --> 17:33.080
50-dollar speaker, so...

17:33.120 --> 17:36.040
Do you mind if I...?
No, come in.

17:36.080 --> 17:38.080
Thanks.

17:42.640 --> 17:45.000
Nah. I was a shit stripper.

17:45.040 --> 17:48.120
Didn't even make it past my trial
week. I thought you were great.

17:50.160 --> 17:53.000
You don't recognise me, do you?
From the moving company.

17:53.040 --> 17:55.040
You're from 'Please To Move You'?

17:55.080 --> 17:58.120
Well, no, not anymore.
No. Now we're folding.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.480
So that's two jobs
I've lost in one week.

18:00.520 --> 18:02.640
But I read the file.
That's not necessary.

18:02.680 --> 18:04.680
There are things you can do
to turn that around.

18:04.720 --> 18:08.000
Well, tell that to the dickheads
who decided we're not worth saving.

18:08.040 --> 18:10.080
Oh, sorry.

18:10.120 --> 18:12.120
Ah!

18:12.160 --> 18:14.200
Ah.

18:16.840 --> 18:19.560
200 bucks right there - that's...

18:19.600 --> 18:22.880
What I could - I mean,
have you thought about

18:22.920 --> 18:25.040
doing other work?
Yeah.

18:25.080 --> 18:27.280
Cleaning?
Cleaning?

18:27.320 --> 18:29.320
No, I can't.

18:29.360 --> 18:31.360
Ah, so you'll take your clothes off
for strangers,

18:31.400 --> 18:33.560
but God forbid if you have
to clean a woman's house.

18:33.600 --> 18:36.480
I've just got to get back and help
fix the truck so they can sell it.

18:36.520 --> 18:39.280
Ah. Yeah, I'm not the only one out of
work. You know, there's four of us.

18:39.320 --> 18:41.680
Ah.
But thanks.

19:08.160 --> 19:11.200
House cleaners?
I've never cleaned a house before.

19:11.240 --> 19:14.760
It's gross.
Possibly shirtless cleaning.

19:14.800 --> 19:17.720
If-if that's what the clients want.

19:17.760 --> 19:20.840
Uh, I don't think that's gonna
work out so well for all of us.

19:21.800 --> 19:24.040
What about the removals?
Oh, we'll do them.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.640
Just if you don't get enough
removals bookings,

19:26.680 --> 19:28.960
you'll have to clean.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.040
And what about the shirt business?

19:31.080 --> 19:33.040
Optional extra, billable.

19:33.080 --> 19:35.560
Tom, what do you have to say about
your experience as a stripper?

19:35.600 --> 19:37.600
Mate, you stripped?

19:37.640 --> 19:39.680
Yeah, I only did it
for a little bit.

19:39.720 --> 19:43.120
Did you feel exploited?
I loved it.

19:43.160 --> 19:45.640
(LAUGHING) You must have
been pretty shit.

19:45.680 --> 19:48.960
Fuck off, I was all right.
(LAUGHS) (LAUGHS)

19:49.000 --> 19:51.040
How do you know about him
being a stripper?

19:51.080 --> 19:53.080
Oh, er, my friends

19:53.120 --> 19:55.240
booked him as a surprise...

19:55.280 --> 19:57.320
surprise, uh, present.

19:57.360 --> 20:00.520
I just think there are a lot of women
who really like the thought of a man

20:00.560 --> 20:03.480
cleaning their house,
shirtless on request.

20:03.520 --> 20:05.600
And I think they'll pay for it.

20:06.680 --> 20:08.720
Is that all right with everyone?

20:11.800 --> 20:14.200
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
Gina.

20:15.360 --> 20:17.720
I would like to make an offer
on the removals company

20:17.760 --> 20:20.480
'Pleased To Move You'.
We closed them down.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.520
We do offer counselling,
you know that.

20:22.560 --> 20:24.680
You didn't close them. I did.

20:24.720 --> 20:27.720
Only, um, I didn't. (LAUGHS)

20:27.760 --> 20:29.800
I decided they qualify
for business recovery.

20:29.840 --> 20:31.840
Gina, that place is history.

20:31.880 --> 20:35.000
And you can smell it on them
and the manager's like... 50.

20:41.440 --> 20:45.240
I can't give you a company. Yes,
you can if it's not worth anything.

20:45.280 --> 20:47.360
Hm, it's not that it's
worth nothing.

20:47.400 --> 20:50.320
The company has assets - you know,
client base, corporate knowledge.

20:50.360 --> 20:53.320
Truck, if I recall.
But I don't have any money yet.

20:53.360 --> 20:55.360
Not on my own.

20:55.400 --> 20:57.880
The creditors need 10% of assets

20:57.920 --> 21:00.520
so if you can find a way
to come up with that,

21:00.560 --> 21:02.600
it could be yours.

21:03.640 --> 21:05.680
Could I pay in instalments?

21:07.480 --> 21:09.520
I'd need a commission.

21:18.280 --> 21:20.680
Gina, that is so brave.

21:20.720 --> 21:22.720
True god.

21:22.760 --> 21:25.720
You frickin' nailed it.
Where'd you find your cleaners?

21:27.160 --> 21:30.440
Actually it's the, uh, stripper

21:30.480 --> 21:32.480
you got me for my birthday.

21:32.520 --> 21:35.240
The one with the four-pack?
The very same.

21:35.280 --> 21:37.280
(CHUCKLES)

21:45.080 --> 21:47.120
Hm. You still here?

21:48.600 --> 21:51.080
Brett let me go.

21:51.120 --> 21:53.240
There was a restructure. He had to.

21:55.440 --> 21:58.160
Were you the only one?
Yep.

21:58.200 --> 22:00.200
That's not a restructure.

22:00.240 --> 22:02.880
That's age discrimination. That's
a problem. We can pursue that.

22:02.920 --> 22:05.800
I wouldn't worry about it.
I'm setting up a different business.

22:07.240 --> 22:09.280
What kind of business?

22:13.440 --> 22:16.480
Removals.
Removals?

22:16.520 --> 22:18.720
(CHUCKLES) Gina, do you know
what you're getting into?

22:18.760 --> 22:20.760
It's fine. We already have the -

22:20.800 --> 22:23.480
Is this some kind of scheme? Cos you
know this pyramid selling business -

22:23.520 --> 22:26.440
some of them are just a scam.
It's perfectly fine.

22:26.480 --> 22:29.200
I'm just helping them diversify
their service base.

22:29.240 --> 22:31.280
Into what? What?
What?

22:31.320 --> 22:33.920
Listen, it's the first day
and I'm-I'm-I'm late.

22:33.960 --> 22:36.280
Yeah, just gotta, mm, run.

22:40.520 --> 22:43.040
You remember how to clean
with a microfibre?

22:44.160 --> 22:46.480
S shape.
What's a microfibre again?

22:48.120 --> 22:50.760
OK, just ask her how she'd
like her house cleaned.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.800
I'm sure she'll tell you.

22:52.840 --> 22:55.200
Can I ask you, what did you
like when I was cleaning?

22:55.240 --> 22:57.240
Cos I didn't know what
I was doing, so...

22:57.280 --> 22:59.280
any pointers would be great.
Uh...

22:59.320 --> 23:01.360
Well, you were good at
the skirting boards.

23:02.320 --> 23:04.560
No, no, like...

23:04.600 --> 23:06.960
what did you like?
Oh!

23:08.640 --> 23:12.000
Er, do you remember what you did
with your shirt?

23:12.040 --> 23:14.640
I took it off.
Yeah. And?

23:14.680 --> 23:16.680
You put it in your back pocket.

23:16.720 --> 23:18.720
Yeah, you could maybe try that again.
Oh.

23:18.760 --> 23:20.840
Um, and, you know, leave it there.

23:20.880 --> 23:22.920
Yeah, no problem.

23:24.080 --> 23:26.480
Should I do the introductions for
you? No, no, no, I've got it,

23:26.520 --> 23:28.760
I've got it. Yeah, I'm just
gonna stay here. All right.

23:28.800 --> 23:30.800
All right. OK.
(CHUCKLES)

23:30.840 --> 23:32.880
Elbow grease.
Yeah.

23:44.760 --> 23:47.080
I've come to clean your house.
Good.

23:47.120 --> 23:49.120
Great.

23:51.240 --> 23:53.280
Um, do you wanna start in here?

24:13.720 --> 24:15.720
Sorry.

24:15.760 --> 24:18.160
You're gonna have to tell me
how to do some of this.

24:18.200 --> 24:20.200
Oh.

24:20.240 --> 24:22.240
Oh.

24:26.880 --> 24:28.880

Yeah.

24:43.680 --> 24:45.680
Just...

24:47.040 --> 24:50.000
Thomas? Yeah.
Sorry, can I call you Tom?

24:50.040 --> 24:53.160
Yeah. Tom, would you mind
taking your boots off, please?

24:54.360 --> 24:56.360
Yes. Sorry.

25:01.560 --> 25:03.560

I have a boyfriend.
I brought ice cream.

I'm off dairy, Tom.

So, um... is everything going OK?

Is it going OK?

27:20.120 --> 27:22.600
He is fine. Kicking like a bastard.

He?
Yeah.

Bye, Tom.
Yeah.

Hello?

27:56.640 --> 27:58.640
Hi, I was wondering if
I could make a booking

27:58.680 --> 28:00.680
for one of those house
cleaners, please?

28:00.720 --> 28:04.400
Yes. Yes.
I'm sorry, it's so noisy in here.

28:04.440 --> 28:06.440
When would you like?

28:06.480 --> 28:08.600
Sometime on Thursday.
OK.

28:08.640 --> 28:11.560
Sorry, can - I -
can you say that again?

28:11.600 --> 28:13.800
Um, hi. (LAUGHS)

28:13.840 --> 28:15.840
Oh.
Excuse me.

28:17.080 --> 28:19.080
Are you the one with the service?

28:19.120 --> 28:21.560
Yes, I am. Can you just give me
a couple of minutes?

28:21.600 --> 28:24.560
I'm just taking a booking.
I must have this house cleaner.

28:24.600 --> 28:26.640
Oh.
I've heard it's very good.

28:26.680 --> 28:29.160
I hear he leaves no surface
untouched,

28:29.200 --> 28:31.200
gets into every crevice.

28:31.240 --> 28:34.120
So I was wondering if you had
any availability on Thursday.

28:34.160 --> 28:36.200
Excuse me. No, I'll take Thursday.

28:36.240 --> 28:38.440
(SCREAMING AND LAUGHTER)

28:38.480 --> 28:40.840
You did so good!

You know it's just
for cleaning, right?

28:45.000 --> 28:48.960

but cleaning is just a cover.

No.

It won't be that hard.

29:12.760 --> 29:14.760
Don't lie to me.

29:14.800 --> 29:17.560
OK, because you're over 50
it's gonna be very hard.

29:17.600 --> 29:19.640
I know.

29:22.080 --> 29:24.120
Oh, I'm not gonna do it.

29:24.160 --> 29:26.160
Why not?
(GASPS)

29:27.920 --> 29:31.120
I couldn't ask those men to do that.
Actually, I think he was the one

29:31.160 --> 29:33.160
who offered.
I just couldn't.

29:33.200 --> 29:35.200
Oh, God.

29:35.240 --> 29:37.280
You're so... British.

What does that mean?
This is a very good idea.

to make a booking?

30:28.280 --> 30:30.320
Well, for cleaning or for sex?

Both.

30:34.040 --> 30:36.040
(CHEERING AND LAUGHTER)

30:49.400 --> 30:52.440
Obviously you don't have to
if you don't want to.

30:52.480 --> 30:56.720
And, um, I have prepared
a whole redundancy package

30:56.760 --> 30:58.760
for each of you.

30:58.800 --> 31:01.640
That perhaps is the other option.

31:04.600 --> 31:06.600
And if we want to?

31:06.640 --> 31:09.000
Well, then, you just
go right ahead.

31:09.920 --> 31:11.920
(CHUCKLES)

31:11.960 --> 31:14.520
And you just ask your client if she'd
prefer to have her house cleaned

31:14.560 --> 31:17.160
before or after.

31:17.200 --> 31:19.720
(CHUCKLES)
Oh.

31:19.760 --> 31:22.280
Don't look at me.

31:22.320 --> 31:25.120
Well, then you could
just do the housework.

31:26.120 --> 31:28.120
Business as usual.

31:29.440 --> 31:31.920
Well, uh, so...

31:31.960 --> 31:34.000
right, so, um...

31:34.040 --> 31:36.800
quality control.
Um, obviously the cleaning

31:36.840 --> 31:40.120
must be effective, and there must be
a minimum of one orgasm.

31:40.160 --> 31:43.240
(LAUGHS)
You've thought of everything.

31:43.280 --> 31:45.280
Do we count our own?

31:45.320 --> 31:48.640
If we count hers and mine,

31:48.680 --> 31:51.160
that's two, right?
That's a multiple?

31:51.200 --> 31:53.200
Yours is irrelevant.

31:55.600 --> 31:57.760
Is she serious?
I think she is.

31:59.080 --> 32:01.520
I'm down for it. It will be
like career enhancement.

32:01.560 --> 32:03.720
Dude, you can't hold down
a job to save your life.

32:03.760 --> 32:05.800
You can't even keep
a driver's license.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.840
It wasn't my fault.
It's never your fault.

32:07.880 --> 32:09.960
What if you don't like her?
Your client?

32:10.000 --> 32:12.480
Gina was pretty clear. If you don't
like anything about the session,

32:12.520 --> 32:15.480
you can leave it.
Or what if she doesn't like us?

32:15.520 --> 32:17.560
When I did my stripping week,
that was the worst bit.

32:17.600 --> 32:19.640
You can be like really well-built.
If you're a stripper,

32:19.680 --> 32:21.840
you can't just be a bit hot.
You have to be smoking.

32:23.440 --> 32:25.440

32:25.480 --> 32:27.520

Oh.

32:53.840 --> 32:56.000
Jesus.
Is that shit even legal?

32:56.040 --> 32:58.040
Yeah, that stripper joint
I worked for did that,

32:58.080 --> 33:00.080
but they had some kind
of a special licence.

33:00.120 --> 33:02.120
Apparently took them ages to get it.
Yeah, I've heard,

33:02.160 --> 33:04.560
but we need to get started.
So if we did a website like this,

33:04.600 --> 33:07.080
could we make the site owner
anonymous? Yeah, but you still need

33:07.120 --> 33:09.440

with the right search words.

is different.

I don't wanna give up on sex
forever, so... (CHUCKLES)

41:19.600 --> 41:22.560

You could, like, start with...

41:23.440 --> 41:26.960
..a foot rub, and then move
onto a little massage,

41:27.000 --> 41:29.560

to take it any further.

The same with my girlfriend,

42:44.800 --> 42:47.040
or my ex. We stopped, as well.

42:53.480 --> 42:57.360
Was that just because
it wasn't very good?

42:57.400 --> 42:59.840
Oh, no, no, it was great.
But it was always up to me.

42:59.880 --> 43:02.280

about this. Good.

1:28:21.040 --> 1:28:23.400
who feel sexually invisible,

1:28:23.440 --> 1:28:25.560
whose husbands never learned

1:28:25.600 --> 1:28:27.600
how to take a hit for the team.

1:28:27.640 --> 1:28:30.200
We're there for those who like
to climax more than once,

1:28:30.240 --> 1:28:32.240
and for those who are sick
of doing it alone.

1:28:32.280 --> 1:28:35.480

contrary to appearances,

1:28:35.520 --> 1:28:37.520
we haven't given up on sex,

1:28:37.560 --> 1:28:41.040
and we're sick of cleaning the house.
ALL: Yes! (CHUCKLING)

1:28:46.880 --> 1:28:48.920
Were you ever harmed or...?

1:28:48.960 --> 1:28:51.600
I don't think so, checking in,
but, um...

1:28:51.640 --> 1:28:53.640
that'll be a no.
Oh.

1:28:57.920 --> 1:29:00.320
"give orgasms."

1:29:01.640 --> 1:29:04.560
It's not actually illegal.
We checked.

1:29:04.600 --> 1:29:07.160
We applied for a licence
and everything. Mm. Mm.

1:29:08.800 --> 1:29:10.800

without a licence

regulated industry.

1:29:17.160 --> 1:29:20.000
The fine will be in the tens
of thousands of dollars.

1:29:22.040 --> 1:29:25.080
I don't want you to pay it.
Well, I'm gonna have to.

1:29:25.120 --> 1:29:27.120
It's not like you've got a job.

I am not.
But you are.

1:29:44.280 --> 1:29:48.680

Adrian, would you just fuck off?

if you've changed your mind.

1:30:01.920 --> 1:30:04.960

yourself - you do realise that.
