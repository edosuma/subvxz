00:06.731 --> 00:08.960
Previously on Rogue...

00:10.287 --> 00:11.550
Shit.

00:13.460 --> 00:15.634
- Did you actually see her shoot him?
- No, I didn't.

00:15.655 --> 00:17.009
Then you don't know it was her.

00:17.044 --> 00:18.371
You think I had something to do with this?

00:18.410 --> 00:19.326
Did I say that?

00:19.365 --> 00:22.035
There's a recording of
you killing Talia Freeman.

00:22.079 --> 00:26.626
This whole thing is a misappropriation
of the wiretap statute!

00:26.693 --> 00:29.441
The aunt's house was well within
the constraints of the warrant.

00:29.450 --> 00:32.273
A warrant which does not
name me as the target.

00:32.280 --> 00:33.999
The recording is inadmissible.

00:34.049 --> 00:35.971
I got something you
might be interested in.

00:36.091 --> 00:37.343
Just keep my name out of it.

00:37.463 --> 00:39.802
The voices you're about
to hear allegedly belong

00:39.836 --> 00:43.488
to Chicago attorney, Marty
Stein and Talia Freeman,

00:43.745 --> 00:45.583
- (Bleep) weasel.
- Where...

00:47.130 --> 00:50.079
She had this flash drive,
had a back door to the NSA.

00:50.107 --> 00:52.425
So, she had the keys to
the whole fucking world.

00:56.370 --> 00:57.468
I need your help.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:53.830 --> 01:54.915
I need your help.

01:56.294 --> 01:57.360
Stand up.

02:02.240 --> 02:03.304
Where's your weapon, at?

02:03.710 --> 02:05.577
It's, it's in the bag.

02:12.310 --> 02:13.507
I'm calling Greg.

02:14.250 --> 02:15.535
What?

02:15.725 --> 02:17.199
Look, I just...

02:17.233 --> 02:19.718
I need you to hear me out. Okay?

02:20.660 --> 02:21.590
Please don't.

02:21.623 --> 02:23.388
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't.

02:23.508 --> 02:25.271
Because Greg is the one trying to kill me!

02:25.695 --> 02:27.924
Come on. He doesn't have it in him.

02:27.980 --> 02:30.248
Yeah, well, he has enough
money to hire someone who does.

02:40.040 --> 02:41.658
You think I killed Stolper?

02:43.610 --> 02:44.570
Did you Mia?

03:02.313 --> 03:03.826
So, how long did it take you

03:03.882 --> 03:05.373
to figure out my real name?

03:05.700 --> 03:07.138
Not very long.

03:10.356 --> 03:12.188
What happened at Neil's place that night?

03:13.914 --> 03:16.494
I met with Neil and we
got into an argument.

03:16.710 --> 03:17.807
About what?

03:21.543 --> 03:24.515
Neil was a very possessive, abusive man.

03:26.336 --> 03:28.218
He grabbed me and I pushed him back.

03:28.252 --> 03:30.475
And the next thing I
know I heard gun shots.

03:31.251 --> 03:33.619
This guy with a balaclava
came out of nowhere.

03:34.149 --> 03:35.540
A balaclava, huh?

03:37.065 --> 03:39.390
He just started shooting...
and Neil got hit.

03:39.400 --> 03:40.751
I ran to hide.

03:40.935 --> 03:43.667
Then, next thing I know I heard
someone coming in the house

03:44.040 --> 03:46.264
I grabbed my gun and I found you.

03:47.403 --> 03:49.107
Is that the story you want me to believe?

03:49.227 --> 03:50.643
You can believe whatever you want,

03:50.850 --> 03:51.950
it's what happened.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.819
I was there that night,
nobody came in or out, Mia.

03:54.820 --> 03:57.389
Okay, maybe he was already
inside waiting for us.

03:57.390 --> 03:58.931
Maybe he used the back door.

04:00.560 --> 04:02.255
Or maybe, you're just full of shit.

04:04.165 --> 04:05.539
If I killed Neil,

04:05.718 --> 04:07.846
why would I be here asking for your help?

04:09.276 --> 04:10.850
'Cause you think you're playing me.

04:10.970 --> 04:12.426
To what end?

04:12.801 --> 04:15.420
Well, I haven't figured
it out yet but it's early.

04:15.540 --> 04:16.894
Will you let me know when you do?

04:20.882 --> 04:21.882
Look...

04:23.173 --> 04:25.262
I just want to give Greg the flash drive.

04:25.980 --> 04:27.423
I want him to leave me alone.

04:27.450 --> 04:28.919
And I need you to broker the deal.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.019
- Why would I do that?
- Because I'll pay you.

04:31.020 --> 04:32.400
Greg's already paying me.

04:32.520 --> 04:34.093
Well, I'll pay you a lot more.

04:35.221 --> 04:37.689
I need you to tell Greg
that for $4,000,000,

04:37.690 --> 04:39.177
he can have the flash drive.

04:39.216 --> 04:40.433
You get 20%.

04:40.456 --> 04:43.019
Mia, we both know that Greg
doesn't have that kind of money.

04:43.670 --> 04:44.640
Really?

04:45.800 --> 04:47.181
Did he tell you he's broke?

04:52.275 --> 04:53.739
Can I use your computer?

04:53.740 --> 04:55.252
I want to show you something.

04:56.268 --> 04:57.120
Sure.

04:58.284 --> 04:59.664
It's over there. Come on.

05:12.430 --> 05:13.404
There you go.

05:23.827 --> 05:25.184
So, what do you wanna know?

05:26.810 --> 05:28.989
- Mmm?
- You want someone's e-mails,

05:29.408 --> 05:32.044
listen to their phone calls, voicemail.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.770
Grace Travis. Her voice-mail.

05:34.803 --> 05:36.373
It's a San Francisco area code.

05:37.518 --> 05:40.143
Grace Travis.

05:42.657 --> 05:45.656
_

05:45.728 --> 05:47.432
_

05:47.862 --> 05:49.202
Grace Travis.

05:49.632 --> 05:52.414
SFPD Detective First Class.

05:53.363 --> 05:55.140
Hi, Mom. It's me.

05:55.542 --> 05:57.374
I just miss hearing your voice.

05:58.210 --> 05:59.479
Where d'you get that drive?

05:59.480 --> 06:00.669
I didn't get it,

06:00.789 --> 06:01.876
I created it.

06:03.021 --> 06:04.272
You did?

06:04.392 --> 06:07.199
Took me a long time, didn't
work for a long time, but

06:07.462 --> 06:08.585
now it does.

06:09.115 --> 06:10.244
Mmm.

06:11.439 --> 06:13.613
So Burns Wagner, the NSA,

06:13.624 --> 06:16.148
they have no idea that you are
accessing all this, is that right?

06:17.060 --> 06:18.109
Not yet.

06:20.627 --> 06:22.884
So is there anything else you want to see?

06:24.100 --> 06:25.883
Give me Greg Barrett's bank accounts.

06:48.313 --> 06:51.866
_

06:52.363 --> 06:53.676
So will you help me?

06:56.800 --> 06:57.882
I'll think about it.

06:59.030 --> 07:01.104
Oh, while you think about it,

07:02.081 --> 07:03.472
can I use your shower?

07:06.650 --> 07:08.040
You know, I was living in a tent.

07:12.550 --> 07:13.654
Sure.

07:14.044 --> 07:16.033
I'll get you a fresh towel. Come with me.

07:23.160 --> 07:24.969
It's a smear campaign, Ralph.

07:24.990 --> 07:26.489
I don't care what you
think you heard on the news,

07:26.494 --> 07:28.779
I can assure you Marty is 100% innocent.

07:28.829 --> 07:30.449
Trust me, you don't
want to be making a move

07:30.465 --> 07:31.971
so close to closing this deal.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.950
Yes, Bernie, I know, I know!

07:34.070 --> 07:35.639
I know, yes, there are a lot...

07:35.640 --> 07:38.251
There are plenty of law firms out there

07:38.270 --> 07:39.602
who would do a decent job

07:39.641 --> 07:41.792
defending your business,
but let me just...

07:42.188 --> 07:45.166
Bernie let me ask you one...
Let me just ask you one thing!

07:45.451 --> 07:48.311
What is the one reason
why should stick with me?

07:48.320 --> 07:50.349
Forget the 25 years we've been together.

07:50.356 --> 07:52.712
The one reason why you
should stick with me.

07:52.832 --> 07:54.784
I'll tell you why Bernie. Because

07:54.801 --> 07:56.789
in all this time, you have never once,

07:56.790 --> 07:59.571
not once been to trial. Not once!

07:59.691 --> 08:01.571
- Atheneum's staying.
- So is Parker.

08:03.459 --> 08:06.140
Yeah, well, if I have a catch the
motherfucker's behind all this,

08:06.170 --> 08:09.123
yes, that will be a good day in court.

08:09.486 --> 08:11.424
Look, Bernie, can I count

08:11.436 --> 08:14.491
on your continuing
friendship and your business?

08:15.961 --> 08:16.865
Good.

08:17.139 --> 08:18.938
Thank you, Bernie. You won't regret it.

08:19.200 --> 08:20.099
Okay.

08:20.680 --> 08:21.819
How we doing?

08:21.853 --> 08:24.119
Few undecided. Some
wouldn't take my calls.

08:24.120 --> 08:26.014
Well, fuck them. You know what,

08:26.081 --> 08:28.058
anyone who is bailing,

08:28.178 --> 08:30.110
send their accounts to collections.

08:30.230 --> 08:32.878
Use Boorman. He's out of his fucking mind.

08:33.458 --> 08:35.184
You know what, we're moving on.

08:37.436 --> 08:40.423
I want libel complaints prepared against

08:40.429 --> 08:42.094
that fucking news network,

08:42.116 --> 08:43.674
the reporter, his producer,

08:43.696 --> 08:46.109
the fucking president
of the goddamn network,

08:46.110 --> 08:49.237
the CEO, the DEA Task Force, the FBI,

08:49.265 --> 08:53.270
I want Special Agent Harper
Deakins named specifically.

08:54.180 --> 08:57.052
Get me Senator Richmond please.

08:57.390 --> 08:58.755
How much do you want named in the suit?

08:58.778 --> 09:01.956
I don't care, 200 mil for
damages to name and reputation?

09:01.995 --> 09:04.787
- Let's say 250?
- Yeah, sure, why not? Let's say 250.

09:04.788 --> 09:06.480
Senator Richmond on the line.

09:07.430 --> 09:08.441
Senator?

09:08.743 --> 09:11.038
Yeah, well, I'm okay.

09:11.300 --> 09:13.876
No, but now I want to kill someone.

09:14.139 --> 09:16.010
I just wanted to check and make sure

09:16.038 --> 09:17.826
that we're still up for lunch tomorrow.

09:18.240 --> 09:20.020
- Good.
- Sophie Hale.

09:20.140 --> 09:21.908
Okay, Senator, I'll let
you get back to work.

09:22.495 --> 09:23.500
Well,

09:24.114 --> 09:26.685
tell them thanks for the
offer, but I'm not interested.

09:26.686 --> 09:28.780
- Okay, see you then.
- What offer?

09:30.020 --> 09:32.790
That was Wallace Keller.
They just tried to poach me.

09:33.288 --> 09:35.278
Don't answer that.

09:40.160 --> 09:43.580
I want a mandatory partners'
meeting tomorrow morning at 10:00.

09:43.616 --> 09:47.220
All full and junior partners
will be in attendance.

09:47.247 --> 09:50.476
I will answer any and all
questions at that time!

09:50.509 --> 09:53.185
I'm going to face this head-on.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.352
What's next?

09:58.318 --> 09:59.407
Who's next?

10:26.310 --> 10:27.453
Greg, it's Ethan.

10:27.880 --> 10:29.079
Did you find her?

10:29.080 --> 10:30.263
I know where she is.

10:31.296 --> 10:32.330
Tell me.

10:32.346 --> 10:34.458
More importantly, I can
get you the flash drive.

10:34.578 --> 10:35.880
Shit! You have it?

10:35.890 --> 10:37.780
- Like I said I can get it.
- Where is it?

10:39.020 --> 10:40.124
I need to talk to you.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.229
- So talk.
- Not on the phone.

10:42.230 --> 10:44.210
Where's the fucking flash drive, Kelly?

10:44.330 --> 10:47.123
Meet me on the corner of Michigan
and Superior in 20 minutes.

11:17.346 --> 11:18.440
Mia?

11:19.030 --> 11:20.170
Yeah?

11:20.830 --> 11:21.847
Can I come in?

11:23.830 --> 11:25.835
Um, give me a sec.

11:38.407 --> 11:39.501
Can I help you?

11:40.020 --> 11:40.950
Come here.

11:44.020 --> 11:44.920
Sit down.

11:46.150 --> 11:47.243
Why?

11:47.696 --> 11:49.159
'Cause I don't want you going anywhere.

11:49.160 --> 11:51.430
- I'm not going anywhere, Ethan.
- No, I know.

11:51.930 --> 11:54.270
- Sit down, Mia.
- No.

11:55.511 --> 11:57.703
Ethan, why would I let you tie me up?

11:57.752 --> 11:59.204
I'm going to meet Greg,

11:59.324 --> 12:00.719
see if I can work out a deal.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.629
And you want my help or not?

12:07.980 --> 12:08.950
Fine.

12:10.403 --> 12:11.693
Tie me up, Ethan.

12:22.120 --> 12:23.719
Are you enjoying this?

12:24.960 --> 12:26.076
Are you?

12:26.774 --> 12:29.606
Not as much as I usually
do when I'm being tied up.

12:33.270 --> 12:34.883
I'll be back as soon as I can.

13:00.900 --> 13:02.799
- Did you know?
- Of course not.

13:02.833 --> 13:04.129
Well, so who leaked the tape?

13:04.151 --> 13:05.094
I don't know.

13:05.122 --> 13:08.230
Evidence doesn't walk
out of here by itself.

13:08.240 --> 13:11.194
I know that. This could get
this Task Force shut down.

13:11.255 --> 13:14.870
The task force? If it comes
out that the DEA or the FBI

13:14.910 --> 13:17.248
or anyone in this office
leaked federal evidence

13:17.304 --> 13:20.515
that's a bull's-eye not only on the
task force but on you personally.

13:20.550 --> 13:22.319
I'm aware of that.

13:22.320 --> 13:24.170
It's not a leap to involve me, either.

13:24.213 --> 13:26.189
And my career does not
need that kind of trouble.

13:26.190 --> 13:27.664
So get out in front of it.

13:27.926 --> 13:29.650
Make a statement, deny it.

13:29.770 --> 13:31.359
Goddamn it, deny what?

13:31.360 --> 13:33.568
There's only one place the
leak could've come from!

13:33.573 --> 13:34.629
So what do you want me to do?

13:34.630 --> 13:36.807
Find the son-of-a-bitch who leaked it.

13:36.807 --> 13:37.880
And assign blame.

13:37.924 --> 13:39.239
Because there's going to be heat on this

13:39.240 --> 13:40.527
and I'm not taking the hit.

13:46.601 --> 13:47.501
Deakins?

13:48.177 --> 13:49.482
Get your ass in here.

13:54.088 --> 13:55.651
It could've been any number of people,

13:55.661 --> 13:56.900
someone in that courtroom.

13:57.020 --> 13:59.125
It's not like Stein doesn't have enemies.

14:03.060 --> 14:05.358
You know I should fire your ass right now,

14:07.630 --> 14:09.285
except it would be admitting liability.

14:13.994 --> 14:16.152
You better pray for your
sake, this goes away.

14:19.132 --> 14:20.178
Just go home.

14:22.425 --> 14:23.280
Okay.

14:33.342 --> 14:35.580
You've made a habit of lying to me, Greg.

14:35.700 --> 14:36.881
I didn't lie to you.

14:36.930 --> 14:38.999
You always said you were
on the verge, financially.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.067
- I am.
- Oh, yeah?

14:40.076 --> 14:41.023
I'll tell you what...

14:42.153 --> 14:44.736
It says here that you have two
accounts in the Cayman Islands,

14:44.749 --> 14:46.139
both worth $5,000,000.

14:46.140 --> 14:47.359
One to Gregory M. Barrett

14:47.542 --> 14:49.571
- another one to Greg Barrett...
- Let me see that.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.033
She wants it all, Greg.

14:52.265 --> 14:53.190
All of it.

14:53.310 --> 14:54.348
The $10,000,000?

14:54.388 --> 14:56.570
- She's out of her mind!
- Listen, I'm just the messenger.

14:56.580 --> 14:59.002
- Do you want the flash drive or not?
- Where is it?

14:59.250 --> 15:01.085
Do we have a deal? Yes or no?

15:02.120 --> 15:03.649
Do we have a deal, Greg?

15:04.856 --> 15:06.749
I'll give you $3,000,000 bucks.

15:07.360 --> 15:08.660
Tell you what, make it $6,000,000.

15:08.660 --> 15:10.040
And I deliver you the hard drive.

15:10.490 --> 15:12.056
And you leave her alone.

15:12.335 --> 15:13.251
Yeah?

15:13.600 --> 15:16.307
What, you're her white knight now, huh?

15:16.675 --> 15:18.105
She's got her claws in you.

15:18.161 --> 15:21.049
- Listen to me...
- Get your fucking hands off me, huh, Greg?

15:21.240 --> 15:23.429
It's strictly business, understand?

15:23.435 --> 15:25.139
Yeah, you keep telling yourself that.

15:25.140 --> 15:26.573
You know, fuck her.

15:27.875 --> 15:29.316
You call me tomorrow, Greg.

15:32.780 --> 15:34.019
Fuck her!

15:41.190 --> 15:44.183
- Thank you for coming over.
- Yeah. Uh...

15:44.920 --> 15:47.634
You didn't sound too good. On the phone.

15:52.630 --> 15:53.560
So?

15:54.270 --> 15:56.845
Uh, so this is weird.

15:57.740 --> 15:58.990
Oh, this is weird.

15:59.425 --> 16:00.609
Um...

16:01.110 --> 16:02.576
I know, uh...

16:02.810 --> 16:04.201
Look.

16:04.369 --> 16:06.067
If you need to talk to me, I'm here.

16:12.234 --> 16:13.976
I did something stupid.

16:14.345 --> 16:16.769
Really stupid. At work.

16:17.290 --> 16:18.908
With Patrick?

16:19.596 --> 16:21.774
Patrick went back to CPD.

16:21.976 --> 16:23.322
Things got weird between us.

16:23.322 --> 16:26.080
- So you did try something after?
- No, it was nothing like that.

16:26.149 --> 16:27.121
Just...

16:27.383 --> 16:30.165
- He let me down. I trusted him.
- Well,

16:30.517 --> 16:31.869
he was your partner.

16:31.897 --> 16:34.489
You were supposed to trust
him. Sorry that happened.

16:34.679 --> 16:36.852
You were my partner. I
was supposed to trust you.

16:36.972 --> 16:37.980
I didn't.

16:38.662 --> 16:39.841
Yeah.

16:44.550 --> 16:46.041
I leaked evidence.

16:48.590 --> 16:50.336
That doesn't sound like you.

16:50.790 --> 16:52.191
I had a win.

16:52.369 --> 16:53.838
Like a big win.

16:54.500 --> 16:56.793
And then I lost it and...

16:58.697 --> 17:00.127
I couldn't let it go.

17:00.831 --> 17:01.926
Fuck!

17:02.389 --> 17:04.739
Okay, okay, maybe it's
not bad as you think.

17:04.740 --> 17:06.606
It might be my career.

17:10.910 --> 17:12.130
Come here.

17:14.480 --> 17:15.637
Come on.

17:20.413 --> 17:21.949
It's gonna be okay, Harper.

17:23.290 --> 17:24.586
Everything's gonna be okay.

17:56.073 --> 17:57.290
What did he say?

17:58.530 --> 17:59.732
The deal is done.

18:00.460 --> 18:02.312
He agreed to the $4,000,000.

18:02.340 --> 18:03.470
When?

18:04.937 --> 18:06.601
Tomorrow morning. First thing.

18:06.623 --> 18:08.120
He's gonna wire the money into my account.

18:08.182 --> 18:09.561
Then I'll give him the flash drive.

18:11.810 --> 18:14.321
Guess I came to the right man for help.

18:17.443 --> 18:20.440
I guess now there's only one thing to do.

18:20.450 --> 18:21.727
Have drinks and celebrate.

18:24.754 --> 18:27.256
Tomorrow you give me my 20%
and I don't see you again.

18:31.390 --> 18:32.550
Okay.

18:35.330 --> 18:36.774
Go back in the bathroom, now.

18:43.141 --> 18:44.280
Coming!

19:08.655 --> 19:09.833
Is it true?

19:11.207 --> 19:12.999
None of this is for attribution.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.660
C'mon, you don't have to say that.

19:14.670 --> 19:16.269
Yes, in fact, I do have to say that.

19:16.270 --> 19:17.552
You're recording this?

19:17.910 --> 19:19.709
Jared, I'm a lawyer.

19:19.710 --> 19:21.860
I do not record my conversations.

19:22.143 --> 19:23.768
Yes, off the record.

19:26.382 --> 19:29.281
You've been with the Post
for how long? 15 years, right?

19:29.550 --> 19:30.728
Something like that.

19:31.890 --> 19:33.470
How long have we been friends?

19:34.051 --> 19:35.653
Since you started paying me.

19:36.330 --> 19:37.552
That's funny.

19:39.560 --> 19:41.423
Some story, huh?

19:42.048 --> 19:45.623
"Rich, bigtime lawyer kills
a smoking hot black chick."

19:45.743 --> 19:47.899
- Juicy.
- I got a better one.

19:47.900 --> 19:50.000
- Yeah, what's that?
- How's this?

19:50.010 --> 19:53.213
Talia Freeman was a junkie
with criminal associations

19:53.554 --> 19:56.860
and she was working
as a Federal informant.

19:57.910 --> 19:59.040
I could sell that.

19:59.050 --> 20:00.479
I'm just getting started.

20:00.480 --> 20:02.501
You want the inside line on this story?

20:02.520 --> 20:05.142
It's gonna get picked up
and it's gonna go wide.

20:06.350 --> 20:07.080
Hmm.

20:07.920 --> 20:09.275
You sleep with her?

20:10.219 --> 20:11.620
Jesus Christ!

20:11.630 --> 20:13.587
Jared, no I didn't sleep with her.

20:13.660 --> 20:15.319
I represented her.

20:15.800 --> 20:17.972
Did I have an argument? Yes, we did.

20:18.408 --> 20:20.598
Tried to keep her out of prison for life.

20:20.900 --> 20:23.150
Was she alive when I left?

20:23.540 --> 20:24.804
Yes, she was.

20:25.870 --> 20:27.401
So I'm gonna run with a story

20:27.446 --> 20:29.836
based on an anonymous but reliable source

20:29.859 --> 20:31.530
closely connected to the case?

20:31.650 --> 20:33.511
Why, you could use me as a source.

20:33.555 --> 20:36.594
But then again, I'd have to bury
you and I don't wanna do that.

20:37.420 --> 20:38.454
I like you.

20:53.262 --> 20:54.306
Look at him.

20:54.474 --> 20:56.775
Come here, look at him.
Have you seen him before?

20:57.524 --> 20:59.099
- No.
- You have never seen him?

20:59.490 --> 21:00.909
- Do you recognize him?
- No.

21:00.910 --> 21:03.198
- Are you sure?
- No, no, I don't recognize him!

21:08.365 --> 21:09.533
Shit.

21:10.298 --> 21:12.275
There's fucking nothing here.

21:15.878 --> 21:18.129
What are we... what are
we supposed to do with him?

21:19.160 --> 21:20.709
It could be more guys coming
we gotta get out of here.

21:20.754 --> 21:21.829
Go, get dressed.

21:21.830 --> 21:23.346
Go, get dressed!

21:47.335 --> 21:48.407
He's here.

21:52.190 --> 21:54.004
Will this night ever end?

22:01.200 --> 22:03.204
Your ex-partner, Harper Deakins?

22:04.215 --> 22:05.421
What about her?

22:05.796 --> 22:08.142
I am going to bury her

22:08.810 --> 22:10.416
and you're going to help me do it.

22:10.880 --> 22:12.142
Oh, am I?

22:12.910 --> 22:15.414
And as a thank you for your co-operation,

22:15.425 --> 22:18.128
I'm gonna start paying for
your mother's care again.

22:19.709 --> 22:21.334
You tried to hurt my business,

22:21.340 --> 22:24.524
you can try to hurt my
firm, you've hurt my name.

22:25.284 --> 22:26.971
You don't get away with it.

22:28.177 --> 22:30.517
What kind of information you looking for?

22:31.470 --> 22:33.533
Well, this is a blood sport.

22:33.578 --> 22:37.063
So, I'm looking for
anything that brings blood.

22:41.118 --> 22:42.621
Oh, my goodness.

22:44.110 --> 22:47.218
My, my, my, my, my.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.575
You like her!

22:50.268 --> 22:51.793
That is amazing.

22:51.820 --> 22:53.870
That bitch gets throws
you out on the street

22:53.914 --> 22:55.718
and you're protecting her?

22:59.243 --> 23:01.176
Well, tick-tock, amigo.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.237
What's it gonna be?

23:05.086 --> 23:06.561
Your ex-partner,

23:07.220 --> 23:08.538
or your mommy?

23:25.310 --> 23:26.280
Nice.

23:29.445 --> 23:31.936
Sorry, that'll be $56 bucks.

23:45.230 --> 23:46.930
Enjoy your stay, Mr. Miller.

24:35.908 --> 24:37.366
We'll be safe here.

24:40.343 --> 24:41.810
So you think Greg sent him?

24:43.594 --> 24:45.102
I don't know, do you?

24:45.471 --> 24:47.147
Yeah, I do.

24:57.386 --> 24:58.570
What are you looking at?

25:15.343 --> 25:16.829
Oh, it's nothing.

25:22.554 --> 25:24.475
So why didn't you just call the cops?

25:25.346 --> 25:27.039
Because they would never believe me.

25:28.335 --> 25:30.173
Yeah, not with your backgrounds.

25:30.206 --> 25:32.536
You looked into me. I figured
that's why you came to me.

25:33.826 --> 25:35.720
Mmm, you were following me.

25:36.010 --> 25:37.926
You didn't think I'd do my research?

25:38.980 --> 25:39.950
Rangers.

25:40.540 --> 25:42.081
Military intel.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.090
I know enough about you
to know you need the money.

25:46.025 --> 25:47.527
You're pretty good, Mia.

25:47.918 --> 25:48.960
Pretty good.

25:48.963 --> 25:50.365
I'll take that as a compliment.

25:50.633 --> 25:51.862
Uhh, don't.

25:52.298 --> 25:53.912
Someone took a shot at me.

25:54.085 --> 25:55.856
And now I wanna know who.

25:56.800 --> 25:59.598
I'm going to find Greg tomorrow
and he's going to tell me the truth.

26:03.966 --> 26:06.169
The flash drive is
worthless to Greg without me.

26:06.170 --> 26:07.160
Why?

26:07.389 --> 26:08.796
Cause you need to know where to look,

26:09.947 --> 26:11.225
because I programed it,

26:11.226 --> 26:13.292
so it needs a new password every 24 hours.

26:13.320 --> 26:16.309
Without it, program degrades
and renders itself useless.

26:16.359 --> 26:19.023
So it's just a bullshit deal, you
were just gonna run off with the money?

26:20.163 --> 26:21.250
Is that it?

26:22.755 --> 26:24.241
Yeah, pretty much.

26:24.361 --> 26:26.023
Let me ask you a question, Mia.

26:26.794 --> 26:29.586
If Greg was willing to
kill you over a flash drive,

26:29.625 --> 26:30.614
what do you think he's gonna do

26:30.664 --> 26:33.200
when he finds out that you
ripped him off of $4,000,000

26:33.233 --> 26:34.881
for something he can't even use?

26:37.076 --> 26:38.299
I don't know.

26:38.635 --> 26:40.729
You're not gonna hang
around to find out, are you?

26:42.265 --> 26:43.555
Mmm.

26:44.281 --> 26:46.705
Let me ask you this, what
do you think he'll do to me?

26:49.778 --> 26:51.040
Right.

26:53.849 --> 26:55.229
Why don't you go to sleep?

27:25.420 --> 27:26.496
You're fine.

27:26.518 --> 27:29.283
When all is said and
done, they work for you.

27:29.574 --> 27:31.584
Channel 3 news isn't running it,

27:32.121 --> 27:34.964
Channel 4 hasn't mentioned it in an hour.

27:34.969 --> 27:36.589
Maybe it's run its course.

27:38.818 --> 27:40.974
Doesn't look like it's
getting any traction.

27:41.755 --> 27:45.329
Maybe, maybe, we just maybe,

27:45.653 --> 27:47.385
have beaten this thing.

27:47.954 --> 27:49.730
Ah. Don't you think it's
a little early for that?

27:49.740 --> 27:51.130
No, I do not.

27:52.875 --> 27:54.741
I don't remember last
time I was this nervous.

27:54.758 --> 27:55.953
What have you got to be nervous about?

27:55.992 --> 27:57.612
Most of your clients
are sticking with you.

27:57.969 --> 28:00.210
Yeah, well, but what's it gonna look like

28:00.490 --> 28:02.589
if my partners start to bail?

28:02.590 --> 28:03.857
Like they're a bunch of pansies

28:03.890 --> 28:06.124
who have been riding
your coattails for years.

28:06.873 --> 28:08.772
What do you care what people think?

28:09.068 --> 28:11.140
Nice try, Betsy. I appreciate it

28:11.151 --> 28:13.525
but I'm not going to let that happen.

28:14.391 --> 28:16.982
Well, at least I look good anyway.

28:36.865 --> 28:38.122
Good morning, sir.

28:39.250 --> 28:41.080
Well, it goddamn will be.

28:56.310 --> 28:57.420
Where's Bobby?

28:57.430 --> 28:59.590
Bobby's in Phoenix at the Grancorp merger.

28:59.710 --> 29:00.966
Celia?

29:01.190 --> 29:02.637
St. Vincent's.

29:02.642 --> 29:04.189
Emergency appendectomy.

29:04.904 --> 29:06.468
And where the hell is Scott?

29:07.518 --> 29:10.219
He said he needed a few
days to process all of this.

29:10.545 --> 29:12.544
He was on the phone all day, yesterday

29:12.561 --> 29:14.673
reassuring clients why does he have...

29:15.047 --> 29:16.359
You know what, fuck him.

29:16.560 --> 29:17.560
Okay.

29:18.186 --> 29:19.582
Obviously.

29:20.370 --> 29:24.777
You are all quite aware of
this Talia Freeman nonsense.

29:24.800 --> 29:27.184
Yes, it is a bump in the road.

29:27.195 --> 29:29.496
Like we've had in the past many times

29:29.535 --> 29:31.792
and we will continue
to have in the future.

29:31.798 --> 29:35.250
The important thing is
that we here are all...

29:45.081 --> 29:46.522
Right.

29:48.059 --> 29:49.198
Yeah.

29:49.628 --> 29:52.370
You guys wanna know the
dark and dirty, okay.

29:52.490 --> 29:54.410
There is absolutely

29:54.530 --> 29:57.164
nothing on that goddamn recording

29:57.337 --> 30:01.011
that proves that I committed
any felony whatsoever.

30:01.131 --> 30:03.153
Did Talia and I have words? Yes, we did.

30:03.183 --> 30:05.673
Did we get angry at
each other? Yes, we did.

30:05.677 --> 30:07.988
Did I raise my voice? Yes, I did.

30:08.010 --> 30:09.543
Can I ask you something?

30:09.578 --> 30:12.594
Who among us have never raised
their voices to a client?

30:12.938 --> 30:14.002
Jimmy?

30:14.243 --> 30:17.407
Tell me you never wanted to
wring Herb Smithers' neck.

30:17.876 --> 30:19.431
And Linda, I know for a fact

30:19.448 --> 30:21.446
that you dream at night about
taking your letter-opener

30:21.450 --> 30:24.676
out of your desk drawer and
sticking it into Mel Kendal's back.

30:24.860 --> 30:26.683
Cutting his cock off, actually.

30:30.048 --> 30:31.196
I know I liked you.

30:32.090 --> 30:33.314
Okay.

30:33.538 --> 30:36.406
Hey, guys. This is the nature

30:36.437 --> 30:38.211
of the profession that we have chosen.

30:38.216 --> 30:40.499
We defend and we protect these people

30:40.526 --> 30:42.265
who sometimes get aggressive,

30:42.300 --> 30:44.373
they get abusive, they
take us for granted,

30:44.395 --> 30:46.097
they get angry, we get angry,

30:46.119 --> 30:48.577
we raise our voices,
we wanna strangle 'em.

30:48.620 --> 30:50.016
But do we actually do that?

30:50.034 --> 30:52.004
No. Why? Because we're moral people

30:52.013 --> 30:55.445
living in a civil society.
We're officers of the court

30:55.565 --> 30:57.111
for crying out loud.

30:58.171 --> 31:00.026
We don't murder people.

31:03.930 --> 31:05.930
So, for the record,

31:07.291 --> 31:08.510
I did not...

31:09.985 --> 31:12.296
Jesus Christ, I did not kill

31:12.541 --> 31:15.745
Talia Freeman. The very notion is absurd.

31:18.959 --> 31:22.841
Unfortunately, the America that
I grew up in no longer exists.

31:23.529 --> 31:27.466
"Innocent until proven guilty"
is just an aphorism taught by...

31:27.542 --> 31:30.996
by... by teachers to our school children

31:31.224 --> 31:33.610
and regurgitated by TV lawyers.

31:35.223 --> 31:36.286
In the world

31:36.738 --> 31:40.951
where we live in, the real
world, the dark and dirty universe

31:41.108 --> 31:43.969
of which we inhabit, the very opposite,

31:44.161 --> 31:45.993
polar opposite is true.

31:46.476 --> 31:48.831
So here I am, an innocent man,

31:49.336 --> 31:51.561
fighting for his fucking life

31:51.749 --> 31:55.132
against gossip mongers who
call themselves journalists

31:55.154 --> 31:57.965
and cockroaches who pretend
to be law enforcement.

31:58.590 --> 31:59.850
And that's what it is.

32:00.065 --> 32:00.960
That's it.

32:07.217 --> 32:09.192
So if anybody has any specific questions,

32:09.201 --> 32:10.403
now is the time to ask.

32:14.035 --> 32:15.108
Anyone?

32:18.514 --> 32:20.266
And if anyone wants to follow

32:20.288 --> 32:22.554
Celia and Bobby, and Scott

32:22.563 --> 32:24.207
can pack up their stuff and FO,

32:24.225 --> 32:26.079
now is the time to do that.

32:30.450 --> 32:31.410
Okay.

32:32.790 --> 32:33.733
Good.

32:34.488 --> 32:36.284
Jimmy, have your people look into

32:36.346 --> 32:38.800
the many ways that I have been slandered.

32:39.010 --> 32:39.832
Linda,

32:39.952 --> 32:42.495
I want to know everyone
who is colorably liable.

32:42.527 --> 32:45.610
Seth, tort claims that I might have.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.107
And Ed,

32:47.652 --> 32:49.767
look into civil rights violations,

32:49.887 --> 32:51.326
both state and federal.

32:51.610 --> 32:52.550
Excuse me?

32:53.641 --> 32:55.474
Unauthorized use of my voice

32:55.527 --> 32:56.854
on a television show.

32:57.020 --> 32:58.168
That's a stretch.

32:58.226 --> 32:59.710
Stretch away. Stretch...

32:59.879 --> 33:02.668
stretch it like a fuckin'
rubber band until it snaps.

33:03.173 --> 33:04.728
Sophie, you're on point.

33:05.020 --> 33:06.627
Hey, look, people.

33:06.960 --> 33:09.295
We, you and I, we, together,

33:09.317 --> 33:11.918
we're gonna beat these motherfuckers down.

33:22.459 --> 33:23.580
Mr. Kelly!

33:25.410 --> 33:26.350
Mr. Kelly!

33:28.514 --> 33:30.350
Mr. Barrett's not here.

33:30.780 --> 33:31.790
Where is he?

33:32.020 --> 33:33.514
He hasn't come in yet.

33:33.724 --> 33:35.520
- Have you heard from him?
- No.

33:35.850 --> 33:36.810
Mmm-hmm.

33:39.841 --> 33:42.000
- Would you like to leave a message?
- It can wait.

33:49.783 --> 33:50.913
What's up, boss?

33:50.935 --> 33:52.892
Jen, get me Greg Barrett's home address.

33:57.840 --> 33:59.961
Sending to you now.

34:00.081 --> 34:02.151
Thanks. And don't worry
about coming in today.

34:09.018 --> 34:10.085
Afternoon.

34:10.112 --> 34:12.964
- Lunch with Senator Richmond, please.
- Right this way.

34:17.208 --> 34:18.782
How are you? How are you doin'?

34:18.822 --> 34:20.230
Hi. How are you?

34:20.350 --> 34:21.982
Hey. Nice to see you
guys. How are you doin'?

34:22.547 --> 34:23.661
Larry!

34:23.920 --> 34:25.929
How are you? Long time. How have you been?

34:27.120 --> 34:28.053
Judge.

34:28.232 --> 34:30.364
- How are you?
- I can't complain, Marty.

34:30.389 --> 34:32.297
I hear Lucy got into Oberlin.

34:32.351 --> 34:34.452
- Early decision.
- Wow, that is, um...

34:34.572 --> 34:35.590
Hi, how are you?

34:35.710 --> 34:37.178
That is fantastic.

34:37.226 --> 34:38.480
Give Serena a big...

34:38.996 --> 34:40.242
big hug for me.

34:40.966 --> 34:42.864
Hi, how are you doin'? Thank you, sir.

34:43.061 --> 34:44.540
Same for me, please.

34:45.545 --> 34:48.089
Jesus, Marty, I think there's a
couple of babies you didn't kiss.

34:49.474 --> 34:51.404
Well, that's your department, Senator.

34:51.524 --> 34:53.379
Honestly, I wasn't sure
you were gonna make it.

34:53.498 --> 34:55.139
You know what, I've given Uncle Sam

34:55.149 --> 34:56.391
so much money over the years.

34:56.400 --> 34:58.522
I figured it's about time
I got a free meal out of it.

35:01.176 --> 35:02.816
So, listen, this, um...

35:02.856 --> 35:04.478
this thing I'm hearing on the news...

35:05.216 --> 35:07.937
It's all implication and innuendo.

35:09.269 --> 35:10.180
Thank you.

35:11.722 --> 35:14.363
Some pissant prosecutor
with a stick up her ass

35:14.394 --> 35:16.865
is trying to make a name
for herself on my back.

35:17.660 --> 35:19.550
- You're not concerned?
- No, I'm not concerned.

35:20.342 --> 35:21.593
But, clearly, you are.

35:23.201 --> 35:24.980
Here's what you're gonna do,
Bob. You're going to invite me

35:25.029 --> 35:27.022
to that hospital ribbon-cutting
ceremony tomorrow.

35:27.030 --> 35:28.676
We're going to stand
on that podium together.

35:28.752 --> 35:30.709
You're going to look
straight into the cameras

35:30.736 --> 35:33.354
and you're gonna say that
we're together lock step

35:33.573 --> 35:34.793
on all things.

35:36.710 --> 35:38.368
Marty, I can

35:38.488 --> 35:39.771
thank you for your contributions,

35:39.784 --> 35:43.712
- like I thank all my donors...
- Your donors can go fuck themselves and suck my dick.

35:44.083 --> 35:46.612
You think you're in
D.C. on the good graces

35:46.634 --> 35:48.649
of the people of Chicago? No one,

35:48.845 --> 35:51.432
no one has given you what I've given you.

35:53.117 --> 35:54.900
Marty, I'm aware of my debt to you.

35:54.941 --> 35:57.050
Good, Bob. Because I'm gonna keep you

35:57.170 --> 35:59.807
aware of your debt to me.

36:03.279 --> 36:04.686
Here's what you're gonna do.

36:05.544 --> 36:06.853
You're gonna single me out.

36:06.867 --> 36:09.396
And you are going to
make a show out of it.

36:11.040 --> 36:12.760
I'm going to win this fight.

36:15.750 --> 36:16.850
Good.

36:18.323 --> 36:19.640
Now, what's for lunch?

37:36.789 --> 37:37.800
Jesus.

37:43.268 --> 37:45.306
Now some people say
"Nothing ever changes."

37:46.713 --> 37:48.309
60 years ago,

37:48.935 --> 37:51.680
two white men grabbed
a 14-year-old black boy,

37:52.140 --> 37:53.070
and beat him,

37:53.810 --> 37:55.050
gouged his eyes out,

37:55.735 --> 37:56.950
shot him in the head

37:57.648 --> 37:59.274
and dumped his body in the river.

38:00.619 --> 38:02.666
They were tried by a jury of their peers

38:02.844 --> 38:03.720
and acquitted.

38:05.592 --> 38:06.780
Two years ago,

38:07.988 --> 38:10.503
a white police officer
shot an unarmed black boy

38:10.530 --> 38:12.402
dead on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri.

38:13.461 --> 38:15.690
The case was brought before a grand jury

38:17.200 --> 38:18.710
which failed to indict.

38:20.629 --> 38:22.255
And just three weeks ago,

38:23.752 --> 38:26.125
a white, wealthy attorney
named Martin Stein

38:26.129 --> 38:29.167
killed a young black female

38:29.444 --> 38:30.771
named Talia Freeman

38:30.891 --> 38:33.466
in her own home, right here in Chicago.

38:35.257 --> 38:36.424
And nothing,

38:37.255 --> 38:40.302
I repeat, nothing whatsoever
happened to Mr. Stein.

38:41.946 --> 38:43.470
There was no grand jury hearing,

38:43.761 --> 38:44.770
there was no trial,

38:46.317 --> 38:47.770
not a goddamn thing.

38:49.972 --> 38:51.948
So it looks like some things do change.

38:54.900 --> 38:56.069
They get worse.

38:56.070 --> 38:56.948
Yes.

38:57.270 --> 38:59.919
Martin Stein battered poor Talia

39:01.010 --> 39:02.439
and then he left her

39:03.069 --> 39:05.272
bleeding on her living room floor.

39:06.532 --> 39:08.382
He didn't call 911.

39:09.222 --> 39:12.350
He didn't try to resuscitate
her. No, not Marty Stein. No.

39:14.190 --> 39:16.220
Marty Stein simply ran away.

39:18.029 --> 39:20.585
And not one goddamn thing happened to him.

39:22.024 --> 39:23.369
And that's dead wrong.

39:23.370 --> 39:24.955
Yes.

39:25.187 --> 39:27.360
It's wrong because black lives matter.

39:28.494 --> 39:31.295
And Marty Stein's gonna
soon learn just how much

39:31.322 --> 39:32.823
Talia Freeman's life mattered.

39:33.010 --> 39:34.137
Yes!

39:38.010 --> 39:38.949
Thank you.

39:51.173 --> 39:52.201
Sorry I'm late.

39:52.232 --> 39:55.257
Judge Kirkpatrick decided
to recite book and verse

39:55.377 --> 39:57.397
before granting my Motion to Exclude.

39:59.876 --> 40:02.450
As long as you've got
good news for me, Rachel.

40:03.071 --> 40:04.881
Maybe you wanna finish that beer.

40:05.212 --> 40:07.044
Uh, beer. Whatever's on tap.

40:07.093 --> 40:08.769
And she'll have another.

40:12.220 --> 40:13.190
How bad?

40:14.707 --> 40:16.128
If they can ever tie it to you,

40:16.199 --> 40:17.142
which they will,

40:18.577 --> 40:20.329
they have a case for
tampering with evidence.

40:20.373 --> 40:23.430
- That's ridiculous.
- The recording's still admissible

40:23.460 --> 40:24.914
in an open murder case.

40:25.034 --> 40:27.371
You're also looking
at slander, defamation,

40:27.671 --> 40:28.851
should I keep going?

40:30.300 --> 40:31.240
No.

40:35.129 --> 40:36.230
Did you do it?

40:39.811 --> 40:41.180
What were you thinking?

40:43.910 --> 40:45.140
He killed that girl.

40:45.150 --> 40:47.331
And this was your best thinking? Really?

40:49.583 --> 40:50.726
It's not right.

40:50.960 --> 40:52.013
Right?

40:52.415 --> 40:53.950
This isn't the way to get him.

40:56.360 --> 40:57.900
Conroy & Hart is begging me.

40:59.230 --> 41:00.584
Money's a little less.

41:01.991 --> 41:04.159
- How much less?
- We can manage.

41:04.279 --> 41:05.919
Ritchie's still going to
that school, though, Scott.

41:05.940 --> 41:07.559
Yes. Of course.

41:11.612 --> 41:12.400
Fuck.

41:15.795 --> 41:17.573
Hey, Jean, how are you?

41:17.693 --> 41:18.905
I'm good, Marty.

41:19.025 --> 41:21.218
Well, good. Because

41:21.393 --> 41:23.068
we are one big, happy family

41:24.091 --> 41:25.816
here at The Stein Firm.

41:25.936 --> 41:28.725
And if you have a problem, that means

41:28.845 --> 41:30.276
Scottie's got a problem,

41:30.303 --> 41:32.368
and if Scottie's got a
problem, what does that mean?

41:32.404 --> 41:33.659
We all have a problem.

41:33.673 --> 41:35.446
We missed you at this morning's
partners' meeting, buddy.

41:35.455 --> 41:39.164
- I know, I'm sorry. The...
- There was a conference at Ritchie's school.

41:39.195 --> 41:40.407
Oh, that's nice.

41:40.434 --> 41:41.854
Because I was beginning to think that

41:41.872 --> 41:44.308
you were a disloyal,
backstabbing cocksucker.

41:44.339 --> 41:45.371
Jesus, Marty! Come on.

41:45.385 --> 41:47.016
And I do mean the last literally.

41:47.038 --> 41:49.009
Did Scottie ever tell you about his arrest

41:49.129 --> 41:51.582
for public lewd and licentious conduct?

41:51.604 --> 41:53.973
It's really... it's quite a story.

41:54.026 --> 41:55.920
You should tell it to
her. It's a ton of laughs.

41:57.091 --> 41:57.833
Well,

41:58.611 --> 42:00.733
anyway, nice see you, Jean.

42:01.836 --> 42:04.481
You should tell Ritchie to
work hard and stay in school

42:04.517 --> 42:05.969
because someday he
might have a strange man

42:05.987 --> 42:08.869
suck his dick in a public
crapper just like his old man.

42:09.673 --> 42:11.070
Chip off the old block.

42:17.161 --> 42:18.280
Oh, shit.

42:21.888 --> 42:24.395
Well, well. Well, well,
well. Look who's here.

42:25.050 --> 42:27.370
Rachel, right? Steiger?

42:27.410 --> 42:28.907
You lost the Walters case.

42:28.929 --> 42:31.360
Wow, you had your head handed
to you on a silver platter.

42:31.369 --> 42:33.411
You guys are perfect for each other.

42:34.166 --> 42:35.868
Here for your last meal, Stein?

42:37.683 --> 42:39.251
That's good. That's good.

42:39.371 --> 42:43.049
No, I... I ate, actually. I did
actually wanna thank you, though,

42:43.085 --> 42:44.595
Special Agent Deakins.

42:44.760 --> 42:46.691
My phone's been ringing off the hook.

42:47.641 --> 42:51.315
Apparently, when a... an attorney
gets his own murder case dropped,

42:51.435 --> 42:53.088
just like that, despite the fact that

42:53.102 --> 42:55.533
a Federal Task Force
has been accumulating,

42:55.582 --> 42:59.693
constructing, gluing together all
kinds of very damning evidence,

42:59.813 --> 43:01.449
it's a valuable thing in this town,

43:01.498 --> 43:03.638
almost as viable as a six foot seven inch

43:03.692 --> 43:07.271
point guard who can penetrate,
pass and pop a three pointer.

43:07.660 --> 43:09.416
Crazy town, huh, Rach?

43:09.585 --> 43:12.606
I don't know, from now on,
maybe you should call me Magic.

43:12.883 --> 43:14.144
Fuck you.

43:14.670 --> 43:16.361
I'm sorry, Chicago girl,

43:16.982 --> 43:18.121
call me Michael.

43:19.448 --> 43:21.258
Are you gonna let your
client talk to me like that?

43:21.298 --> 43:23.327
We're in the middle of a
private conversation actually,

43:23.327 --> 43:24.270
if you don't mind.

43:24.280 --> 43:26.013
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
- Oh, no.

43:26.044 --> 43:28.408
I'm so sorry I didn't realize that.

43:28.528 --> 43:31.206
You guys have so much
to talk about, I'm sure.

43:31.246 --> 43:33.958
Have you told your
lawyer about the two CIs

43:34.217 --> 43:35.866
that were killed on your watch?

43:37.359 --> 43:40.446
And the fact that you used your position

43:40.880 --> 43:44.562
to get charges dropped
against your junkie boyfriend?

43:44.615 --> 43:47.283
- Okay, Marty. Come on, that's enough.
- He had a 12-year-old boy,

43:47.403 --> 43:50.010
a 12-year-old boy in his
car, that's fantastic.

43:50.049 --> 43:51.930
You know what your problem is, Stein?

43:52.846 --> 43:53.981
Arrogance.

43:54.303 --> 43:55.782
You think you see everything.

43:55.796 --> 43:57.293
You think you know everything.

44:00.175 --> 44:01.310
I know one thing.

44:02.735 --> 44:05.474
When I'm done with you, you're
gonna want to put a bullet

44:05.971 --> 44:09.487
right in your brain.

44:09.514 --> 44:11.530
- All right.
- Just like your old man.

44:11.583 --> 44:12.486
Yeah, that's it.

44:12.553 --> 44:13.916
- Why did he do it?
- We're done. Thanks, Marty.

44:13.960 --> 44:15.430
- I forget.
- All right, Marty.

44:15.462 --> 44:16.945
- Suck on it.
- Come on.

44:17.793 --> 44:20.314
- Under the chin.
- Enough. Could you please leave?

44:20.394 --> 44:22.977
- 45, 38...
- You're sick.

44:27.500 --> 44:28.460
Sorry.

44:30.922 --> 44:32.110
What an asshole.

44:45.100 --> 44:46.155
Deakins.

44:46.450 --> 44:47.312
Now.

44:53.430 --> 44:54.462
Is this real?

44:54.515 --> 44:55.717
Real enough that my boss

44:55.726 --> 44:57.402
is already looking for outside counsel.

44:57.570 --> 44:58.669
Should I be worried?

44:58.670 --> 44:59.735
Worried about what?

45:00.293 --> 45:01.857
Close that, will you?

45:05.651 --> 45:08.806
Your little stunt may cost
us a lot more than our jobs.

45:08.926 --> 45:10.633
Stein is suing both the task force

45:10.660 --> 45:12.197
and the three of us individually.

45:12.898 --> 45:16.164
- I had nothing to do with...
- I don't want to hear your lies right now.

45:21.370 --> 45:23.323
Stein is comin' after you, Deakins.

45:23.604 --> 45:25.571
He's coming after you
with everything he's got.

45:25.771 --> 45:27.711
Criminal. Civil.

45:28.377 --> 45:30.218
I told you, if you take
a shot at Marty Stein,

45:30.232 --> 45:31.532
you better not miss.

45:32.640 --> 45:33.743
You missed.

45:35.410 --> 45:36.527
- I...
- No, no...

45:37.010 --> 45:37.796
Don't.

45:50.160 --> 45:51.549
Question of the day.

45:51.764 --> 45:54.221
Why do sheep always follow

45:54.341 --> 45:56.540
the sheep right in front of it?

45:56.660 --> 45:57.559
Why is that?

45:58.800 --> 46:01.398
Mile after mile, day after day.

46:02.944 --> 46:05.102
It can't be because sheep number two

46:05.339 --> 46:07.283
enjoys the particular aroma

46:07.292 --> 46:09.209
emanating out of sheep number one's butt.

46:09.245 --> 46:11.041
No, it can't be that. It's
gotta be more than that.

46:11.095 --> 46:12.890
Here's my theory. Sheep number two

46:12.926 --> 46:14.995
doesn't have the sheep balls big enough

46:15.058 --> 46:16.720
to venture off on his own,

46:16.734 --> 46:18.329
and to think for himself.

46:18.449 --> 46:21.184
Now, who is sheep number
one in our little fairytale?

46:21.211 --> 46:24.669
Senator Bob Richmond. And
after the ceremony tomorrow,

46:24.691 --> 46:26.987
half the city of Chicago'll
be fighting each other,

46:27.005 --> 46:29.253
to stick their noses up his ass.

46:29.561 --> 46:31.353
Cases aren't won in court, Betsy.

46:31.397 --> 46:32.989
They're won by public opinion.

46:33.016 --> 46:34.280
I told you, what did I tell you?

46:34.400 --> 46:35.569
What did I tell you?

46:35.570 --> 46:36.801
We are going to pull this off.

46:37.011 --> 46:38.557
Is it okay I talk now?

46:40.840 --> 46:42.436
Yes, of course, sweetheart.

46:43.570 --> 46:44.987
The floor is all yours.

46:45.107 --> 46:45.890
Ah.

46:46.069 --> 46:47.300
I got nothing.

46:51.750 --> 46:52.750
I got it.

47:02.354 --> 47:03.632
I'm here to see Mr. Stein.

47:10.770 --> 47:11.740
Mr. Stein.

47:13.440 --> 47:14.440
Chad.

47:14.560 --> 47:16.730
Can I take your coat? Or
get you something to drink?

47:16.740 --> 47:18.023
No. I won't be staying.

47:18.810 --> 47:20.210
Chad, what can I do for you?

47:20.880 --> 47:22.063
Spit it out.

47:22.921 --> 47:24.324
Senator Richmond has decided

47:24.364 --> 47:25.803
that in light of recent events...

47:25.808 --> 47:27.604
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- That it would be better for all concerned

47:27.658 --> 47:29.882
if you didn't attend the
ribbon-cutting ceremony tomorrow.

47:29.890 --> 47:31.218
- Get him on the phone.
- He's in a meeting.

47:31.227 --> 47:33.350
I don't give a fuck if he's in a meeting!

47:33.360 --> 47:35.190
Get him on the goddamn phone!

47:35.253 --> 47:37.625
- He said no calls.
- What the fuck?

47:38.412 --> 47:41.200
The news is making every
decision we make very difficult.

47:41.900 --> 47:42.840
The news?

47:44.940 --> 47:47.300
Mr. Stein, I think you
should turn your TV on.

47:57.468 --> 47:58.898
And just three weeks ago,

48:00.547 --> 48:03.442
a white, wealthy attorney
named Martin Stein killed

48:03.518 --> 48:07.611
a young black female named Talia Freeman

48:07.781 --> 48:10.569
- in her own home, right here in Chicago.
- Holy fuck.

48:12.039 --> 48:13.164
And nothing...

48:13.209 --> 48:15.376
Holy fuck.

48:15.550 --> 48:17.927
- I hope given the circumstances...
- Get the fuck out.

48:18.047 --> 48:19.510
No grand jury hearing,

48:20.769 --> 48:21.828
no trial,

48:23.209 --> 48:25.242
- not a goddamn thing.
- We'll get through this, Marty.

48:26.296 --> 48:27.798
That motherfucker.

48:28.302 --> 48:29.737
That's dead wrong.

48:29.902 --> 48:32.158
That's wrong because black lives matter.

48:34.600 --> 48:37.044
And Marty Stein's gonna
soon learn just how much

48:37.066 --> 48:39.318
Talia Freeman's life really mattered.

48:53.908 --> 48:55.401
- What...
- Who the fuck are you?

48:55.472 --> 48:57.102
- What? What are you talking about?
- Who the fuck are you?

48:57.134 --> 48:59.573
- What are you talking about?
- Greg is dead.

49:00.508 --> 49:02.907
- What?
- He was tortured to death, Mia.

49:03.680 --> 49:04.990
By who?

49:05.280 --> 49:06.415
Who's comin' after you?

49:06.415 --> 49:08.412
I don't know. I swear
to God, I don't know.

49:08.444 --> 49:10.686
Look. I know this isn't
just about insider trading.

49:10.722 --> 49:13.948
- What did you do?
- Nothing. I didn't do anything. I swear to God.

49:14.145 --> 49:15.575
All right, you know
what? That's it, I'm done.

49:15.610 --> 49:17.116
Okay. You have to listen to me.

49:18.077 --> 49:19.860
Okay, listen, I don't
know what's going on.

49:19.869 --> 49:22.112
I don't know who's after me. But
I need help finding them, okay?

49:22.143 --> 49:23.270
I can't do it by myself.

49:23.770 --> 49:24.740
That's not my problem.

49:26.526 --> 49:28.174
Look, it is your problem.

49:28.206 --> 49:29.889
Okay? You think it's just about me now?

49:29.940 --> 49:32.159
Huh? This is about you too.

49:32.588 --> 49:34.147
Whatever they think that I know,

49:34.147 --> 49:35.653
whatever they think that I did,

49:36.703 --> 49:38.687
how do you know they don't
think that I told you too?

49:38.732 --> 49:40.318
All right. I'll take my chances.

49:40.354 --> 49:42.248
Hey, look. I can make you a lot of money.

49:42.553 --> 49:43.647
All right?

49:44.020 --> 49:45.395
That flash drive,

49:46.391 --> 49:48.129
I know where everything is.

49:48.156 --> 49:49.724
I know what everything is worth.

49:49.778 --> 49:52.641
I know what everyone
does and says and thinks.

49:52.686 --> 49:55.081
And that is worth hundreds
of millions of dollars.

49:55.894 --> 49:58.280
I will split it with you
50-50 right down the middle.

50:02.970 --> 50:04.477
Just think about that, Ethan.

50:25.590 --> 50:27.088
I got your text.

50:30.600 --> 50:32.370
You leaked the recording.

50:33.853 --> 50:36.283
I gotta say, that surprised me.

50:36.744 --> 50:39.050
- I didn't think you had it in you.
- Don't.

50:39.510 --> 50:40.710
Don't what?

50:43.272 --> 50:45.216
Don't act like you and I are friends.

50:46.520 --> 50:48.469
You texted me, remember?

50:48.820 --> 50:50.060
We're not friends.

50:50.720 --> 50:51.503
Fine.

50:52.093 --> 50:53.116
We're not friends.

50:55.525 --> 50:57.267
Stein's trying to ruin me.

50:57.424 --> 50:58.830
That surprises you?

51:00.945 --> 51:02.770
So I'm calling in my chit.

51:03.970 --> 51:05.217
Excuse me?

51:05.767 --> 51:08.033
You said you would help me bring him down

51:08.153 --> 51:10.285
in exchange for my silence.

51:12.295 --> 51:13.710
And I need that help.

51:17.143 --> 51:19.490
Marty summoned me last night.

51:24.363 --> 51:27.570
He promised not to throw
my mom out on the street

51:27.616 --> 51:29.341
if I give him dirt on you.

51:30.890 --> 51:32.429
So what dirt did you give him?

51:33.284 --> 51:36.170
I'm trying to gain his trust back, Deaks.

51:36.970 --> 51:38.203
What did you give him?

51:38.704 --> 51:40.500
Bunch of shit about Jack,

51:42.100 --> 51:43.400
the drug bust.

51:48.078 --> 51:50.070
I told him about your dad's suicide.

51:50.950 --> 51:51.950
I know.

51:53.653 --> 51:55.392
He just threw it in my face.

51:56.463 --> 51:59.654
I'm trying to get on his good side,

52:00.123 --> 52:01.320
to help you.

52:01.383 --> 52:02.991
And I'm supposed to believe you?

52:03.060 --> 52:04.345
Let me prove myself.

52:09.827 --> 52:11.150
What about your mom?

52:11.315 --> 52:14.039
I'm gonna work overtime, I'll
take a second fuckin' job.

52:14.040 --> 52:16.129
I need to make this up to you.

52:18.617 --> 52:21.302
You are going to help me
nail Stein to the wall.

52:24.710 --> 52:25.710
I can do that.

52:53.010 --> 52:54.141
You didn't have a choice.

52:55.080 --> 52:56.326
It was either him or us.

52:57.778 --> 52:59.720
No. I had a choice.

53:03.453 --> 53:04.990
Ethan, we can't just sit here.

55:07.935 --> 55:08.990
You good?

55:09.209 --> 55:10.058
Yeah.
