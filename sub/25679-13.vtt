I want to make
some money with you,

00:08.041 --> 00:09.876
{\an7}but I need to know
about your personal life.

00:09.943 --> 00:12.379
{\an8}Had a little rough past
and, you know,

00:12.445 --> 00:13.847
{\an8}gotta go to jail next month.

00:13.913 --> 00:15.415
{\an8}So, I can relate.

00:15.482 --> 00:17.450
{\an7}I'm in a strip club looking
like a (bleep) idiot,

00:17.517 --> 00:20.320

supposed to be investing in.

00:20.387 --> 00:22.155

lean on nobody.

00:22.222 --> 00:23.156
{\an8}I'm on your team, man.

Everyone that comes
into your life

{\an8}feels like
they can disrespect me.

00:31.564 --> 00:34.134
{\an7}So if she's gonna be a part
of whatever you guys are doing,

00:34.200 --> 00:36.035

00:36.102 --> 00:37.604
{\an8}That's the bottom line.

00:37.670 --> 00:41.107
{\an7}And I just wanna say to
you guys, especially you, Mo,

00:41.174 --> 00:43.042

Basically, you know,

02:41.961 --> 02:43.496
Ray, he threw this event
for the fathers.

02:43.563 --> 02:45.598
He called it
Father Figure Friday.

02:45.665 --> 02:48.434
{\an4}Mm-hmm.

02:45.665 --> 02:48.434
So it was me, Lucci, um, him,

02:48.501 --> 02:49.903
and he had that dude
Roccstar come through.

02:49.969 --> 02:53.740

03:01.080 --> 03:02.882
And so the dude, Roccstar,

03:02.949 --> 03:05.685
you know, pretty much
insinuating about how

03:05.752 --> 03:07.253
he dealt with your wife
or slept with your wife.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.622
I kinda got up
and walked away.

03:11.157 --> 03:13.560

didn't want to be in.

03:15.194 --> 03:16.396
I ain't gonna lie to you, bro.

07:41.227 --> 07:42.762
with a bag of lies.

07:42.829 --> 07:44.130
That's not cool.

07:44.197 --> 07:45.965
{\an1}And then I didn't want her
to feel that way.

07:46.032 --> 07:48.234
{\an1}Yeah, so you didn't want me
to feel what way?

07:48.301 --> 07:49.435
{\an5}What you wanna say?

07:48.301 --> 07:49.435
{\an1}So...

07:49.502 --> 07:50.903
(Nikki)
I wanna say something.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.572
{\an4}I didn't know you guys
had animosity--

07:50.970 --> 07:52.572
First of all--

07:52.638 --> 07:54.574
{\an4}so I wouldn't have put you guys
in the room if I knew.
You know that.

07:54.640 --> 07:55.942
(Teairra)
When Nikki invited me here,

07:56.008 --> 07:58.444
I was not thinking that Moniece
was gonna be here.

07:58.511 --> 08:00.446
Nikki and Moniece
are not even close

08:00.513 --> 08:02.882
and have been beefing
on and off for years.

08:02.949 --> 08:05.918
But there she is, running
her mouth about me again,

08:05.985 --> 08:08.387
just like I told her not to do.

08:08.454 --> 08:09.622
{\an1}Well, there is
no animosity for me.

08:09.689 --> 08:11.357
{\an1}For me,
all it's about is this.

08:11.424 --> 08:12.625
Can you give me a second?

08:12.692 --> 08:14.460
{\an1}Thank you.

08:14.527 --> 08:16.696
Brooke called me
when I got back

08:16.762 --> 08:18.631
and she showed me
a, a plane ticket

08:18.698 --> 08:20.566
{\an1}and then she showed me
a video of, like,

08:20.633 --> 08:23.703
{\an1}somebody following you guys
to the airport in Dallas

08:23.769 --> 08:25.471
{\an1}and, like,
him dropping you off.

08:28.074 --> 08:30.576
{\an1}T., I didn't know
you went back to Dallas.

08:30.643 --> 08:32.745
Who cares?
That's my business.

08:32.812 --> 08:34.513
Let me just say this.

08:34.580 --> 08:35.681
Yes, I went back.

08:35.748 --> 08:37.917
He is a man that I...

08:37.984 --> 08:40.653
thought that loved me
and I love,

08:40.720 --> 08:42.288
and I just wanted to hear him

08:42.355 --> 08:45.024
maybe even (bleep)
lie to me and just--

08:45.091 --> 08:46.626
{\an5}Like, closure and stuff.

08:45.091 --> 08:46.626
--tell me... yes.

08:46.692 --> 08:47.994
I just want to say,

08:48.060 --> 08:49.729
that last time that I
went to go and see him,

08:49.795 --> 08:51.063
it was it for me,

08:51.130 --> 08:53.099
because I knew
that all he wanted to do

08:53.165 --> 08:56.135
was coerce me into
dropping the lawsuit

08:56.202 --> 09:00.139
and he would have
played me for filth again.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.241
{\an6}That was my business.
I went.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.241
{\an1}And if you went
and got your closure--

09:02.308 --> 09:04.310
{\an1}I don't understand why
bitches is trying to dig up

09:04.377 --> 09:05.912
or listening to him.

09:05.978 --> 09:08.514
{\an1}We've all been
through relationships,

09:08.581 --> 09:10.650
{\an1}like I said to you,
when it comes to me and A.D.,

09:10.716 --> 09:12.585
{\an1}I keep it surface,
because we break up,

09:12.652 --> 09:14.287
{\an5}get back, break up, get back.

09:12.652 --> 09:14.287
That's your business.

09:14.353 --> 09:15.721
{\an1}I don't wanna involve
anybody else

09:15.788 --> 09:18.190
{\an1}because the people
that do love me

09:18.257 --> 09:20.526
{\an1}go on
this roller-coaster with me.

09:20.593 --> 09:22.395

{\an1}Our priorities aren't
in line, you know?

22:01.653 --> 22:03.055
{\an1}She's focused
on her own (bleep).

22:03.121 --> 22:04.489

to give her a ring,

22:04.556 --> 22:06.124

22:06.191 --> 22:08.660
{\an1}and I want her to focus more
on our relationship.

22:08.727 --> 22:09.861
You know what I'm saying?

22:09.928 --> 22:11.697
{\an1}Like, I just...
I want the person I'm dating

22:11.763 --> 22:13.865
{\an5}to be involved in everything--

22:11.763 --> 22:13.865
{\an3}Right.

22:13.932 --> 22:15.033
--I got going on too.

22:15.100 --> 22:17.069
{\an1}And if I can't see
certain things, then...

22:17.135 --> 22:18.870

22:18.937 --> 22:22.140

22:22.207 --> 22:24.042
{\an1}And, and Kamron
is a priority to me.

22:24.109 --> 22:25.811
I grew up in that (bleep).

22:25.877 --> 22:28.046
{\an1}I don't want no one else
to grow up in that.

22:28.113 --> 22:29.347

22:29.414 --> 22:30.482

right now, man.

feisty, you feel me?

22:32.484 --> 22:33.652
She went to London.

22:33.719 --> 22:35.620

heavy (bleep) out there.

22:35.687 --> 22:37.689

I mean, every single day.

22:37.756 --> 22:39.658
I'm like, "Yo, chill," like...

22:39.725 --> 22:41.259
Kamron is almost a teenager.

22:41.326 --> 22:42.861
I think it's more than that.

22:42.928 --> 22:44.796
{\an4}I think she does have
more anxiety than you do--

22:42.928 --> 22:44.796
{\an3}Absolutely.

22:44.863 --> 22:46.198
{\an1}--just because she has been
through some things.

22:46.264 --> 22:48.800
{\an1}And one of the biggest (bleep)
gripes right now, man...

22:48.867 --> 22:51.369

I'ma be honest.

22:51.436 --> 22:53.305

22:53.371 --> 22:55.173

Shut up, man.

22:55.240 --> 22:57.943

so much more arguments.

22:58.009 --> 23:00.812
{\an1}I never was trying to make it
a situation for y'all.

23:00.879 --> 23:03.148
But to be all honest
with you, like...

23:03.215 --> 23:06.318
all of the drama that's
been created 'cause of it

23:06.384 --> 23:08.520
has just caused me
to be like, "Yo,"

23:08.587 --> 23:11.123
like, I'm falling back,
I'm cool, like...

23:11.189 --> 23:12.224

23:12.290 --> 23:14.726
Like, I'm, I'm chilling.

23:14.793 --> 23:18.864
{\an1}I don't know if the intentions
were proper dating you.

23:18.930 --> 23:22.434
I was surprised that Dreux
and Tiffany lasted this long.

23:22.501 --> 23:24.169
I knew it was gonna end
at some point.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.871
Tiffany is way too stubborn.

23:25.937 --> 23:28.006

23:34.513 --> 23:36.681

was taking a...

more serious than I did.

23:38.784 --> 23:41.720

wanting to link the kids up,

23:43.321 --> 23:45.290
can be amicable

23:45.357 --> 23:47.125

that's the only thing

23:47.192 --> 23:49.427

to be able to work

23:49.494 --> 23:51.429

affected our co-parenting?

32:11.863 --> 32:12.997

{\an1}with every bitch
that you (bleep) with.

32:33.951 --> 32:36.454
{\an1}All I felt like was that you
didn't have my back,

32:36.521 --> 32:39.190
{\an1}it felt petty,
and that was the bottom line.

32:39.257 --> 32:41.559

32:41.626 --> 32:44.262

Dreux unknowingly
sealed my fate

came out to the world

calling me a deadbeat mom.

32:54.372 --> 32:56.641

33:00.845 --> 33:02.880
{\an7}Exactly.
You don't never have (bleep).

33:02.947 --> 33:05.850
{\an5}Every time you get ten seconds
with Kam, all you do is say--

33:02.947 --> 33:05.850

{\an5}"Take a selfie with me, Kam."

33:05.917 --> 33:07.352
{\an3}I can't.

33:07.418 --> 33:09.687
{\an1}And you put it on your Instagram
like you around him for hours.

33:09.754 --> 33:15.693
If the father of my child
has little to no respect for me,

33:15.760 --> 33:19.864
why would the woman that he's
in a relationship respect me?

33:19.931 --> 33:22.834
Stop saying that I didn't...
you're raising Kam full-time,

33:22.900 --> 33:24.369

can you take this baby

33:27.605 --> 33:29.474
because my life
is in shambles?"

33:29.540 --> 33:31.042

a deadbeat.

{\an1}You done told me
all type of stuff.

37:16.701 --> 37:17.835
{\an6}Right.

37:16.701 --> 37:17.835
You know what I'm saying?

37:17.902 --> 37:19.403
The one thing that I,
that I went to A1 with

37:19.470 --> 37:21.906
{\an1}is the (bleep) that you said
in front of everybody.

37:21.973 --> 37:24.208
{\an1}But what I'm saying is I'm
not even the only contender.

37:24.275 --> 37:26.177
{\an5}There's four or five
contenders...

37:24.275 --> 37:26.177
I ain't gonna lie.

37:26.243 --> 37:28.646
{\an5}I'm (bleep) with A1,
but that's the only reason
I didn't say nothing.

37:28.713 --> 37:30.147
{\an1}I'm only responsible
for what I know.

37:30.214 --> 37:32.783
Well, now it's public
information and, and

37:32.850 --> 37:35.086
{\an1}you put me in a position
to where I'm phony as hell

37:35.152 --> 37:37.388
{\an5}if I don't let my guy know.

37:35.152 --> 37:37.388
{\an1}Listen to what I'm saying,
my (bleep).

37:37.455 --> 37:39.123
If a whole nother
grown-ass man tell me

37:39.190 --> 37:40.725
some whole nother
grown-ass information

37:40.791 --> 37:42.960
about his whole
personal life,

37:43.027 --> 37:44.929
I'm not going around
telling nobody's business,

37:44.996 --> 37:46.664
{\an4}'cause it's not my business.
Period.

37:44.996 --> 37:46.664
Lucci, Lucci...

37:46.731 --> 37:48.633
{\an4}I'm not the type of (bleep)
that's gonna sit up
in your face.

37:48.699 --> 37:50.267
{\an5}Yeah.

37:48.699 --> 37:50.267
You got a whole wife.

37:50.334 --> 37:51.369
There's a (bleep)
that just talk...

37:51.435 --> 37:52.503
{\an1}sitting up here in front
of everybody

37:52.570 --> 37:53.504
{\an1}talking about he
knocking your wife now.

37:53.571 --> 37:54.805
{\an5}Listen, I...

37:53.571 --> 37:54.805
The biggest thing,

37:54.872 --> 37:55.973
I don't even know why we
talking about another man

37:56.040 --> 37:57.408
and knocking his wife now.

37:57.475 --> 37:59.877
Listen, you, you, you...
I just know how to deal

37:59.944 --> 38:01.412
{\an5}with a (bleep) like you.

37:59.944 --> 38:01.412
What are we doing?

38:01.479 --> 38:02.713
{\an5}That's not have no
conversation with you.

38:01.479 --> 38:02.713
That's easy.

38:02.780 --> 38:04.281
So we got nothing
to say with each other,

38:04.348 --> 38:05.249
{\an5}(bleep), that's it.

38:04.348 --> 38:05.249
{\an1}Nothing whatsoever,
my (bleep), so...

38:05.316 --> 38:06.617
{\an1}I mean,
I don't even know why

38:06.684 --> 38:07.985
you talk to me in the first
place, for real, for real.

38:08.052 --> 38:09.086
I don't know what you mean
why I'm talking.

38:09.153 --> 38:11.355
I say what I say,
I mean what I say.

38:11.422 --> 38:12.723
I'd do the same thing again.

38:12.790 --> 38:14.458
{\an1}I ain't telling your business.
You told your business.

38:14.525 --> 38:16.293
{\an5}Listen, the fact
of the matter is...

38:14.525 --> 38:16.293
You told (bleep).

38:16.360 --> 38:18.696
{\an5}Like I said,
at the end of the day--

38:16.360 --> 38:18.696
{\an1}I ain't,
I ain't trying to do

38:18.763 --> 38:20.197

is Kamron's relationship.

That's the point.

40:22.086 --> 40:23.754

{\an8}I don't wanna be around you!

{\an7}Why that gotta come between
you and Marcus though?

40:42.239 --> 40:45.109
{\an8}Look, you might as well
just go in the booth,
do your thing.

40:45.176 --> 40:47.111

you can't let somebody

{\an8}I'm like, "Oh, man,
I'm with you, bro."
