Pre v/ous/y on
’Pretty Little L/ars. . ”

00:02.870 --> 00:04.292
_ - No!
You okay?

00:04.300 --> 00:05.619
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Again with the lies.

00:05.630 --> 00:07.166
- I'm sorry.
- That was a joke.

00:07.170 --> 00:09.468
I don't need to know
what we are tonight.

00:09.470 --> 00:11.028
I just need to be with you.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.835
Your being here
is not part of the plan.

00:14.840 --> 00:16.637
And neither is what
you're doing to that girl.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.345
I know you killed Charlotte.

00:18.350 --> 00:20.045
There is something
that I have to take care of.

00:20.050 --> 00:21.847
It's a favor for a friend.

00:21.850 --> 00:22.976
Would her name be Spencer?

00:22.990 --> 00:25.379
Help! Please stop!

00:25.390 --> 00:27.039
If someone tried to hurt you,
the police--

00:27.060 --> 00:29.688
I have to talk to my friends
before I do anything.

00:29.690 --> 00:31.851
(Hanna)
Look, in that room
before all the lights went off

00:31.860 --> 00:34.283
and someone pushed me
down a hole, I was scared.

00:34.300 --> 00:35.324
Me too.

00:35.330 --> 00:36.524
Maybe that's why what happened

00:36.530 --> 00:37.724
'happened with us.‘

00:43.970 --> 00:45.665
- 'Help me, Emily.'
- Ali?

00:45.670 --> 00:46.705
I am so sorry.

01:11.530 --> 01:13.020
Oh, my God.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.166
What?

01:14.170 --> 01:15.865
Your back.

01:15.870 --> 01:19.203
Oh, um, it's nothing.
It's ﬁne.

01:19.210 --> 01:22.099
That's definitely not nothing,
Hanna. Those..

01:22.110 --> 01:24.101
God, those look like burn marks.

01:24.110 --> 01:25.941
[doorbell rings]
Did that happen to you in there?

01:25.950 --> 01:27.838
- Spencer's here.
- Hanna..

01:31.790 --> 01:33.678
I told you
not to ask Mary for help.

01:33.690 --> 01:34.714
Okay, well,
if I'd listened to you

01:34.720 --> 01:35.755
I wouldn't have seen Mary

01:35.760 --> 01:37.079
and Elliott together.

01:37.090 --> 01:38.387
So you saw them arguing.

01:38.390 --> 01:39.926
What's so suspicious about that?

01:39.930 --> 01:41.693
No, it was the way
that they argued.

01:41.700 --> 01:43.122
Like they were familiar
with each other.

01:43.130 --> 01:44.859
This definitely wasn't
the first time they met.

01:44.870 --> 01:47.191
Then why would they want us
to believe that they did?

01:47.200 --> 01:49.691
I mean, we know
Mary's working with a man.

01:49.710 --> 01:50.768
Maybe it's him.

01:52.410 --> 01:55.379
No. No. Elliott
would never hurt Alison.

01:55.380 --> 01:56.938
- He loves her.
- Does he?

01:56.950 --> 01:57.974
Because since she's been
In hIS care

01:57.980 --> 01:59.277
she's only gotten worse.

01:59.280 --> 02:00.804
Look, I understand
why Mary wants

02:00.820 --> 02:02.447
to avenge Charlotte's death,
but why would he?

02:02.450 --> 02:05.749
I don't know. I mean,
Ali called me begging for help.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.581
She's clearly scared
of someone in there.

02:07.590 --> 02:09.410
Well, it doesn't mean
that it's Elliott.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.284
I mean, Mary could be
working with somebody else.

02:11.290 --> 02:13.087
Okay, if that's true,
why didn't she call him for help

02:13.100 --> 02:14.124
instead of me?

02:16.070 --> 02:19.164
All of this happened right after
Mary got a hold of Ali's jacket.

02:19.170 --> 02:20.819
Yeah, and then we suddenly
weren't allowed

02:20.840 --> 02:22.660
to visit anymore.

02:22.670 --> 02:24.399
Maybe that's because
he doesn't want us

02:24.410 --> 02:26.503
to see what he's doing to her.

02:26.510 --> 02:29.673
Yeah, well, I did,
and it's awful.

02:29.680 --> 02:32.046
He had her strapped down
to a bed like an animal.

02:34.780 --> 02:36.611
If it is Elliott

02:36.620 --> 02:39.509
he's capable of doing
a lot more than that.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.409
Yeah, we need to get her
away from him.

02:42.420 --> 02:45.480
How? She's his patient
and his wife.

02:45.490 --> 02:47.287
We go to Welby.

02:47.300 --> 02:48.426
We talk to someone in charge

02:48.430 --> 02:49.499
and we tell them
what's gorng on.

02:49.500 --> 02:50.524
Okay, you guys do that.

02:50.530 --> 02:51.622
I'm gonna go talk to Toby

02:51.630 --> 02:52.767
and maybe he find a connection

02:52.770 --> 02:54.067
between Mary and Elliot.

02:58.640 --> 02:59.834
What is it?

03:01.440 --> 03:02.998
I just keep thinking
about the night that Alison

03:03.010 --> 03:04.648
and Elliott came to my house

03:04.650 --> 03:06.379
when they asked me
to marry them.

03:08.320 --> 03:09.844
They seemed so in love.

03:18.060 --> 03:19.220

04:23.290 --> 04:24.484
[Alison moans]

04:43.650 --> 04:46.107
Got a secret_
can you keep It?

04:46.120 --> 04:48.918
Swear this one you'll save

04:48.920 --> 04:53.983
Better lock it in your pocket
taking this one to the grave

04:53.990 --> 04:59.121
If I show you then I know
you won't tell what I said

04:59.130 --> 05:03.624
'Cause two can keep a secret
if one of them is dead

05:06.270 --> 05:07.623
(Emily)
That was your mom.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.892
She offered me a bartending job
at The Radley.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.229
- That's great.
- Yeah.

05:11.240 --> 05:13.333
But she wants me to start today.

05:13.340 --> 05:15.433
And with everything going on, I
don't know if I should take it.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.431
Em, you need to pay for Hollis.
We understand.

05:17.450 --> 05:18.474
I'm sure All will too.

05:20.580 --> 05:22.912
Are you gonna tell Ezra
about Elliott?

05:22.920 --> 05:24.444
No, he's not here.

05:24.450 --> 05:25.849
_ He's out of town
working on notes for the book.

05:30.460 --> 05:31.484
I'll be right back.

05:31.490 --> 05:32.525
[cell phone chimes]

05:37.300 --> 05:38.324
Hanna.

05:41.370 --> 05:42.769
You okay?

05:43.840 --> 05:45.603
Please don't ask me that.

05:47.610 --> 05:50.204
Look, I don't wanna push--

05:50.210 --> 05:52.007
And I appreciate that.

05:53.050 --> 05:54.301
We were all in the dollhouse.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.742
I know
what you're going through.

05:58.290 --> 06:00.019
It's not the same.

06:01.220 --> 06:03.484
Um, can you just
order me a latte?

06:03.490 --> 06:05.321
- I'll be outside.
- Yeah.

06:05.330 --> 06:08.390
So I just wanted to say
thank you for the other night.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.197
Yeah. You looked like
you needed a friend.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.497
And I want to repay you.

06:11.500 --> 06:14.526
So maybe we could
grab dinner some time.

06:14.540 --> 06:17.100
That's not necessary.
I would've done it for anyone.

06:18.840 --> 06:21.058
Hm. It's not just
to say thank you.

06:21.680 --> 06:23.739
Oh.

06:23.750 --> 06:26.002
- Um--
- I-I mean, no pressure.

06:26.010 --> 06:27.307
If you're not interested,
that's--

06:27.320 --> 06:29.845
No, no, it's not that.
It's just..

06:29.850 --> 06:31.647
Then what?

06:32.420 --> 06:33.842
Ezra's key

06:33.860 --> 06:36.420
that whole mess

06:36.430 --> 06:40.218
just kinda left a bad taste
in my mouth, you know?

06:40.230 --> 06:42.619
I still feel terrible
about that.

06:43.230 --> 06:44.652
Me too.

06:53.940 --> 06:56.636
- What was that about?
- Apparently nothing.

07:10.590 --> 07:11.625
[knocking]

07:15.960 --> 07:17.450
Yvonne? Hi.

07:18.370 --> 07:20.463
Spencer.

07:20.470 --> 07:23.189
- Um..
- Toby's not here.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.360
He's working on the house.

07:25.370 --> 07:28.908
Oh! Okay, um,
I'll just go find him. Thanks.

07:28.910 --> 07:30.707
Do you have, uh,
another favor to ask?

07:34.780 --> 07:37.442
Look, I-I really don't
wanna cause any problems

07:37.450 --> 07:38.986
between you two.

07:38.990 --> 07:41.140
You already have.

07:41.160 --> 07:43.481
I know...and I'm sorry.

07:45.330 --> 07:48.925
I wouldn't mind him helping you
if I knew what he was doing.

07:48.930 --> 07:51.148
Last time
he wouldn't tell me anything.

07:51.170 --> 07:52.922
That's because
I asked him not to.

07:52.940 --> 07:56.592
It's just, um..
I'm sorry. It's private.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.999
Well, I can't have him
disappearing again.

07:59.010 --> 08:02.673
Not tonight. We have family
coming over to celebrate.

08:06.080 --> 08:07.206
Oh, my God.

08:08.520 --> 08:11.739
Congratulations.
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

08:11.750 --> 08:13.809
Thanks. We're really excited.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.585
You know what, it's..
This is totally not important.

08:18.590 --> 08:20.353
I don't need to talk
to Toby right now.

08:20.360 --> 08:22.157
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

08:23.330 --> 08:25.264
- Okay.
- Bye.

08:29.670 --> 08:30.762
(Hanna)
'But, Dr. Freedman--'

08:30.770 --> 08:31.805
I wasn't aware Dr. Rollins

08:31.810 --> 08:33.266
was treating Alison

08:33.280 --> 08:35.271
but I assure you
she's in excellent hands.

08:35.280 --> 08:38.670
She's deteriorating every day,
physically and mentally.

08:38.680 --> 08:42.013
Sometimes, patients get worse
before they get better.

08:42.020 --> 08:43.612
Medications often need
to be adjusted

08:43.620 --> 08:46.111
until we get it right.

08:46.120 --> 08:49.283
I'll make sure Dr. Rollins keeps
you apprised of her progress.

08:50.690 --> 08:53.488
We think he's abusing Alison.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.354
And if you don't go
check on her right now

08:55.360 --> 08:58.124
we will file a complaint
against Dr. Rollins...and you.

08:58.130 --> 09:00.621
Against me? On what grounds?

09:00.640 --> 09:02.164
For having knowledge
about the situation

09:02.170 --> 09:04.058
and neglecting
to do anything about it.

09:04.070 --> 09:05.958
And that makes you liable.

09:12.650 --> 09:14.606
Ask Dr. Rollins to meet me
In hIS wrfe's room.

09:28.530 --> 09:31.727
- Dr. Freedman.
- Elliott.

09:31.730 --> 09:34.096
Alison's friends
expressed concern

09:34.100 --> 09:35.761
about her condition.

09:37.610 --> 09:39.908
Well, she had a few bad days

09:39.910 --> 09:42.128
but I'm happy to report
she's doing better.

09:46.850 --> 09:50.047
She's being treated with a low
dose of clozapine. That's good.

09:50.050 --> 09:52.610
'Vital signs are stable
and within normal limits.‘

09:54.060 --> 09:56.051
I know it's hard
but try not to worry.

09:56.060 --> 09:58.255
Dr. Rollins is taking
good care of Alison.

10:13.440 --> 10:15.704
Hey, where have you been?

10:15.710 --> 10:17.598
Uh, Toby's.

10:19.450 --> 10:22.772
He and Yvonne...got engaged.

10:22.780 --> 10:24.941
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:26.890 --> 10:29.654
Wow, that's great.

10:29.660 --> 10:32.220
I'm glad they were able
to work through their issues.

10:32.230 --> 10:33.857
Yeah, me too.

10:36.300 --> 10:39.292
You know,
just knowing how happy they are

10:39.300 --> 10:41.564
got me thinking about us.

10:43.810 --> 10:47.166
'Cause I've wanted this, Caleb,
for a really long time.

10:49.110 --> 10:51.135
So have I.

10:51.150 --> 10:54.108
And it's been great, but..

10:54.120 --> 10:56.918
...you know, everything changed
once Hanna disappeared.

10:58.950 --> 11:01.885
Well, I promised
to keep her safe.

11:02.690 --> 11:04.681
So I felt responsible.

11:06.530 --> 11:09.499
Yeah, but she's back now,
and you still seem distant.

11:10.970 --> 11:13.188
So I keep on asking myself why.

11:20.980 --> 11:23.335
You two were alone together
that night.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.579
Did something happen?

11:27.850 --> 11:29.545
Sh-she was scared.

11:29.550 --> 11:31.518
1-1 was comforting her.

11:33.790 --> 11:35.519
That's not what I'm asking.

11:37.730 --> 11:39.220
We kissed.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.997
Old memories got stirred up.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.719
It was like we were in a time
warp back in high school.

11:45.730 --> 11:47.869
Yeah, bu-but we're not
in high school, you know?

11:47.870 --> 11:50.395
An-and Hanna's not
your girlfriend. I am.

11:50.410 --> 11:51.729
I know.

11:52.570 --> 11:54.231
I know.

11:54.240 --> 11:56.936
Look, I can handle a kiss.

11:57.980 --> 12:00.039
But is that all it was?

12:01.750 --> 12:03.877
Or do you still have
feelings for her?

12:11.330 --> 12:12.979
[cell phone rings]

12:22.040 --> 12:23.439
Hello?

12:26.210 --> 12:29.577
Jason had no idea
that Alison was at Welby.

12:29.580 --> 12:31.002
Elliott never called him.

12:31.010 --> 12:33.205
So Elliott lied.

12:33.220 --> 12:35.006
He must've known
we were at the hospital

12:35.020 --> 12:37.773
and sedated Alison
so she couldn't talk.

12:37.790 --> 12:40.088
Has Toby looked into
Elliott and Mary?

12:40.090 --> 12:42.786
Uh, no. I didn't,
I didn't ask him to.

12:44.090 --> 12:46.422
'Because he just got engaged.‘

12:46.430 --> 12:47.727
Look, I don't think
that we should be

12:47.730 --> 12:49.254
involving him in this anymore.

12:49.260 --> 12:51.524
Okay, that's not your call
to make, Spencer.

12:51.530 --> 12:53.521
'Toby's the only person
that can help us.'

12:53.540 --> 12:55.735
I mean, Ali's life is in danger,
and it's our fault.

12:55.740 --> 12:58.368
No! No, it is her fault.

12:58.370 --> 13:00.804
She's the one
who killed Charlotte.

13:00.810 --> 13:02.732
'I mean, do we all realize
that the only reason'

13:02.740 --> 13:04.230
'we're stuck in this small town'

13:04.250 --> 13:05.603
'is because of
Charlotte's death?‘

13:05.610 --> 13:06.941
That we've been
on a hamster wheel

13:06.950 --> 13:08.747
risking our lives day after day

13:08.750 --> 13:10.149
trying to figure out who it was

13:10.150 --> 13:11.617
when all along it was her!

13:11.620 --> 13:13.747
Alright, we don't know that
for sure.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.614
Whether or not she did it..

13:17.560 --> 13:19.983
...she doesn't deserve
to be tortured.

13:23.830 --> 13:26.128
[sighs]
When does Jason get back?

13:26.130 --> 13:28.667
- He can get All out of Welby.
- He's out of the country.

13:28.670 --> 13:30.467
I don't know. He can't
come back for a few days.

13:30.470 --> 13:32.267
Well, that's too long.

13:32.270 --> 13:34.704
- We have to get her out now.
- How?

13:37.580 --> 13:39.844
You said you saw him open
a locked trunk in his bedroom.

13:39.850 --> 13:41.477
- Right?
- Yeah.

13:41.480 --> 13:42.845
Well, maybe there's
something in there

13:42.850 --> 13:45.512
that he doesn't want
anybody to see.

13:45.520 --> 13:48.318
Maybe whatever it is can help
us figure out what he's doing.

13:48.320 --> 13:50.652
I still have a key
to Ali's house.

13:50.660 --> 13:52.082
Great.

13:58.300 --> 14:00.689
(Spencer)
'Jason didn't even know
that they got married.‘

14:00.700 --> 14:04.136
- 'He freaked out.‘
- Where the hell is Jason?

14:04.140 --> 14:05.869
- 'Ethiopia.‘
- 'What's he doing there?‘

14:05.870 --> 14:08.134
- 'Charity work.‘
- Here.

14:08.140 --> 14:09.277
(Emily)
'1 have to get to work.‘

14:11.210 --> 14:13.849
Okay, we'll let you know
what we find.

14:30.630 --> 14:32.325
So where's, uh, where's Jordan?

14:32.330 --> 14:33.968
I thought he was gonna be
coming back with you.

14:33.970 --> 14:36.234
Oh, no, he's swamped at work.

14:37.340 --> 14:39.331
Is everything okay
with you guys?

14:39.340 --> 14:41.763
Yeah. Great. Why?

14:42.580 --> 14:45.208
'Cause Caleb told me

14:45.210 --> 14:48.145
about what happened between you
two at The Lost Woods.

14:51.850 --> 14:54.546
Spencer, I'm so sorry.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.811
You really
shouldn't have told me

14:55.820 --> 14:57.253
that you were over him
if you weren't.

14:57.260 --> 14:59.148
Well, I am over him, okay?

14:59.160 --> 15:00.718
That was a huge mistake.

15:00.730 --> 15:02.527
- Was it?
- Yes.

15:02.530 --> 15:04.259
Look, I meant what I said.

15:04.270 --> 15:07.797
Caleb is my past
and Jordan is my future.

16:07.230 --> 16:08.481
[vehicle approaching]

16:09.730 --> 16:10.992
Elliott's coming.

16:45.100 --> 16:47.819
Your friends made quite
a spectacle of themselves today.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.694
Oh, I just think it's so amazing

16:49.700 --> 16:52.464
how much better
Alison's gotten overnight.

16:52.470 --> 16:54.836
- I'm doing all I can for her.
- 'Are you?'

16:54.840 --> 16:57.479
'Cause Ali called us
and she's convrnced

16:57.480 --> 16:59.345
that someone at Welby's
is trying to hurt her.

16:59.350 --> 17:01.875
Part of her illness is paranoia.

17:01.880 --> 17:03.518
She thinks
everyone's out to harm her.

17:03.520 --> 17:05.272
It's not paranoia if it's real.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.680
I want you guys
to stop visiting Alison.

17:08.690 --> 17:11.386
- You're disturbing her.
- And what about what she wants?

17:12.660 --> 17:14.981
If you keep pushing

17:15.000 --> 17:17.525
I promise it'll be
detrimental to her health.

17:55.400 --> 17:56.492
[cell phone chimes]

18:08.450 --> 18:10.543
[sighs]
God, what's taking her so long?

18:10.550 --> 18:11.676
I don't know.

18:15.720 --> 18:16.755
Hey.

18:28.940 --> 18:31.261
I never should've agreed
to marry them.

18:31.270 --> 18:33.568
Ali never should've agreed
to marry him.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.605
I mean,
they only dated for one week.

18:35.610 --> 18:37.737
We know nothing about him.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.741
Yeah, well,
apparently, neither did she.

18:39.750 --> 18:41.399
Hey, go to those photos I took.

18:41.420 --> 18:42.444
Oh.

18:48.760 --> 18:50.648
Wait.

18:50.660 --> 18:51.957
'That's Elliott's
credit card statement.‘

18:51.960 --> 18:53.951
'I saw it on his dresser.‘

18:53.960 --> 18:56.599
There's a charge here
for Amish Bed And Breakfast.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.420
That's the same week
that All went with Elliott

18:58.430 --> 19:00.591
to his family's farm.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.261
Why would they stay at a B&B?

19:02.270 --> 19:04.795
I don't know, but it's-it's
only an hour from here.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.766
- I say we drive up there.
- Why?

19:06.770 --> 19:09.898
It's a small community. They
might know Elliott's family.

19:09.910 --> 19:11.673
And what's that gonna do for us?

19:11.680 --> 19:13.978
Maybe they can fill in some
of the blanks about who he is.

19:13.980 --> 19:16.175
Maybe they know
if he's connected to Mary.

19:16.180 --> 19:18.512
Even if we find his family,
I doubt they'll talk to us.

19:18.520 --> 19:20.249
(Aria)
'Well, we have to try.'

19:20.260 --> 19:22.285
If Elliott is working with Mary,
it's only a matter of time

19:22.290 --> 19:24.178
before he does to Ali
what he did to you.

19:25.660 --> 19:27.059
Or worse, so..

19:28.760 --> 19:30.352
I'm going.

19:30.370 --> 19:31.997
Anyone coming?

19:32.000 --> 19:33.627
I-I should stay here,
I'm gonna try to figure out

19:33.640 --> 19:35.289
what Elliott's doing
with these things.

19:35.300 --> 19:36.369
Okay. Hanna?

19:38.640 --> 19:40.767
- Yeah. I'll drive.
- Great.

19:46.650 --> 19:48.606
[rock music]

(Toby on answering machine)
'Hey, you've reached
Toby Cavanaugh.‘

20:07.240 --> 20:08.525
'Leave a message.‘

20:28.560 --> 20:31.711
[sighs]
I can't believe
we lost cell service.

20:31.730 --> 20:34.187
I can't believe
Lucas owns a map.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.326
You know what? You were right.

20:35.330 --> 20:37.890
We should've turned on
to Route 30.

20:37.900 --> 20:40.095
Hey, is Liam still in town?

20:40.100 --> 20:42.466
No. No, he went back to Boston.

20:45.340 --> 20:46.500
We broke up.

20:48.940 --> 20:52.068
Wait, I thought everything
was going great with you guys.

20:52.080 --> 20:53.502
Yeah, it was.

20:55.780 --> 20:58.772
[sighs]
It's just, Ezra and I,
we spent a lot of time

20:58.790 --> 21:01.315
with each other
these last few weeks and..

21:03.020 --> 21:05.921
...I just realized how much
I missed having him in my life.

21:08.530 --> 21:10.589
We're both lucky.

21:10.600 --> 21:13.319
I've got Ezra,
you've got Jordan.

21:15.140 --> 21:16.368
Yeah.

21:19.540 --> 21:22.930
Do you think you'll tell him
what happened to you in there?

21:22.940 --> 21:25.408
I don't wanna involve him.

21:25.410 --> 21:28.208
Why? He's your fiance.
I'm sure he'd wanna know.

21:29.880 --> 21:31.438
- 'Hanna--'
- Aria, stop.

21:33.790 --> 21:35.246
I'm sorry,
I'm just tryin' to help.

21:35.260 --> 21:37.387
Well, you're not.

21:37.390 --> 21:39.984
I wanna forget the hell that
I went through not relive it.

21:39.990 --> 21:41.719
And I don't wanna talk about it,
not with you

21:41.730 --> 21:43.698
not with Jordan,
not with anyone.

21:48.070 --> 21:50.038
If I do, I'll never stop crying.

22:04.150 --> 22:07.881
What if I told you
this wouldn't be easy?

22:11.830 --> 22:15.288
- Here's your whisky and soda.
- Emily.

22:15.300 --> 22:17.825
How did you know what I ordered?

22:17.830 --> 22:20.424
Does the outfit tip you off?

22:20.440 --> 22:22.635
You work here. I didn't know.

22:22.640 --> 22:24.437
No, I'm, I'm training today

22:24.440 --> 22:27.159
but yeah,
I'm gonna be a bartender.

22:27.180 --> 22:29.899
- Well, thanks for the drink.
- No problem.

22:34.120 --> 22:38.170
So I watch you drift away..

22:38.190 --> 22:39.817
I just wanna let you know

22:39.820 --> 22:42.857
that the conversation we had
the other day at The Brew

22:42.860 --> 22:44.851
that was real, it wasn't an act.

22:44.860 --> 22:46.225
You don't have
to explain anything.

22:46.230 --> 22:47.458
We thought Ezra was in trouble

22:47.460 --> 22:49.052
and we wanted to help him out.

22:49.060 --> 22:50.891
I mean, that doesn't make
what we did right

22:50.900 --> 22:52.197
'especially the lying part.‘

22:52.200 --> 22:53.224
Now's really not a good time.

22:53.230 --> 22:54.891
I like you, Sabrina.

22:54.900 --> 22:56.959
And I think you must feel
something for me, too

22:56.970 --> 22:58.665
because if you didn't,
I wouldn't be standing here

22:58.670 --> 23:01.400
making a fool out of myself.

23:01.410 --> 23:03.207
You know, I just wish
that you wouldn't judge me

23:03.210 --> 23:05.849
based on one stupid mistake
because if you got to know me

23:05.850 --> 23:08.876
you'd realize that that's not
who I am at all.

23:08.880 --> 23:11.474
- Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.
- Hey.

23:11.490 --> 23:13.742
- Traffic was terrible.
- Well, it's alright.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.489
Hey, uh, could I get
a glass of chardonnay?

23:15.490 --> 23:16.718
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

- 'HI.'

23:23.360 --> 23:24.896
Well, that was a waste of time.

23:24.900 --> 23:26.162
How was I supposed to know that
they wouldn't

23:26.170 --> 23:27.421
give us any information?

23:27.440 --> 23:29.169
The day is almost over
and we're no closer

23:29.170 --> 23:30.569
to figuring out a way
to help All.

23:30.570 --> 23:31.798
[leaves rustling]

23:42.120 --> 23:43.439
This is the second time today

23:43.450 --> 23:46.089
I've completely
embarrassed myself.

23:46.090 --> 23:47.512
(Spencer)
'Where are you?'

23:47.520 --> 23:48.544
Hiding from Sabrina

23:48.560 --> 23:50.755
and her model girlfriend.

23:50.760 --> 23:53.388
I'm, uh,
taking a 15 minute break.

23:53.390 --> 23:55.950
It's her loss, Em.

23:55.960 --> 23:57.120
Did you make any sense
of the things

23:57.130 --> 23:58.893
Aria found at Elliott's?

23:58.900 --> 24:00.959
Uh, well, I haven't looked up
any of the medications yet

24:00.970 --> 24:02.767
'but this list of ingredients
that he wrote down'

24:02.770 --> 24:05.295
is used to make latex.

24:05.310 --> 24:08.199
Wait. As in gloves?

24:08.210 --> 24:09.768
No, like in masks

24:09.780 --> 24:10.804
like the one that we found
on the Hanna doll

24:10.810 --> 24:11.936
in the bell tower.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.270
'Wait a minute.
What color are Elliott's eyes?‘

24:17.290 --> 24:20.714
(Emily)
'Um, I-I think brown. Why?‘

24:20.720 --> 24:23.780
Because he has these
blue contacts in the trunk.

24:25.090 --> 24:27.923
Em, when Alison checked herself
into Welby

24:27.930 --> 24:30.490
she didn't think
that she just saw her mother.

24:30.500 --> 24:32.718
[keyboard keys clacking]

24:32.730 --> 24:35.392
Hm. She felt
that she saw Wilden too.

24:40.510 --> 24:41.966
I don't think
that he just used the latex

24:41.980 --> 24:44.574
to make a mask of Hanna.

24:44.580 --> 24:47.174
'I think he used it
to make one of Wilden too.‘

24:47.180 --> 24:49.478
He wanted Alison to think
she was crazy.

24:54.790 --> 24:56.155
Let's go look at the furniture.

24:56.160 --> 24:57.309
Why?

24:57.330 --> 24:58.354
Because if he thinks
we're gonna buy

24:58.360 --> 24:59.679
he'll probably talk.

25:21.550 --> 25:24.018
Hi. What's your name?

25:24.020 --> 25:26.284
I'm not supposed
to talk to the English.

25:26.290 --> 25:28.019
Oh. I'm sorry.

25:28.020 --> 25:30.386
I don't wanna
get you in trouble.

25:30.390 --> 25:31.652
You're pretty.

25:31.660 --> 25:33.787
Thanks. So are you.

25:35.900 --> 25:37.652
Hey.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.399
Who's your friend?

25:39.400 --> 25:40.594
I'm Eliza.

25:42.170 --> 25:45.492
Look, I don't know
why Elliott would lie about this

25:45.510 --> 25:47.205
but his family
doesn't own a farm.

25:47.210 --> 25:49.678
There's nobody with the name
Rollins in the county.

25:49.680 --> 25:51.204
Well, I'm starting to wonder
if he's telling the truth

25:51.210 --> 25:52.438
about anything.

25:55.880 --> 25:57.211
Are you okay?

25:58.390 --> 26:00.142
You look like my dolls.

26:01.320 --> 26:02.719
What dolls?

26:02.720 --> 26:04.256
The ones Charlotte gave me.

26:12.730 --> 26:15.824
I found the lipstick,
but Charlotte gave me the dolls.

26:19.410 --> 26:21.970
- Can we play with you?
- Mm-hmm.

26:23.110 --> 26:24.407

26:33.960 --> 26:35.416
Why?

26:35.420 --> 26:37.285
She looks like Charlotte.

26:41.530 --> 26:44.124
Did Elliott and Charlotte
come here a lot?

26:44.130 --> 26:45.961
They used to come all the time.

26:45.970 --> 26:47.767
She loved playing dolly with me.

26:50.270 --> 26:53.762
I saw them kissing once,
but I'm not supposed to tell.

26:57.650 --> 26:59.038
I'm gonna miss Charlotte.

27:01.450 --> 27:02.576
Do you know
when she's coming back?

27:02.580 --> 27:03.945
(male #1)
'Eliza?'

27:05.720 --> 27:07.085
Please don't say anything.

27:07.090 --> 27:08.443
We're not allowed
to have dolls with faces.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.849
If he sees 'em,
he'll take 'em away.

27:18.230 --> 27:19.788
How much better
did Charlotte really get

27:19.800 --> 27:22.394
if she was still naming dolls
after us?

27:22.400 --> 27:23.560
Guessing not much.

27:27.110 --> 27:28.737
I think it's best you go now.

27:46.490 --> 27:48.253
Can I order another drink?

27:48.260 --> 27:51.297
Yeah. Um, whisky and soda?

27:51.300 --> 27:52.927
Please.

27:52.930 --> 27:54.727
H can bring it to your table.

27:55.970 --> 27:56.561
I don't mind waiting.

28:00.510 --> 28:02.831
Look, Emily, um,
about what you said earlier--

28:02.840 --> 28:04.205
You don't have to say anything.

28:04.210 --> 28:06.508
You have a girlfriend. I get it.

28:06.510 --> 28:08.171
She's not my girlfriend.

28:08.180 --> 28:10.774
She's my ex. We're just friends.

28:14.720 --> 28:17.518
I appreciate what you said.

28:17.530 --> 28:19.953
Actually, I couldn't
stop thinking about it

28:19.960 --> 28:21.359
all during lunch.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.957
Really?

28:24.970 --> 28:26.790
I judged you too quickly.

28:28.170 --> 28:29.432
That's not who I am.

28:32.670 --> 28:34.968
Why don't we start over?

28:34.980 --> 28:36.129
'Clean slate.‘

28:38.010 --> 28:39.136
Let's get dinner this week.

28:41.680 --> 28:42.874
You're on.

28:48.590 --> 28:51.218
You know, I didn't even want
another drink.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.084
I just wanted an excuse
to talk to you.

29:05.270 --> 29:08.398
(Aria)
I can't believe Elliott
and Charlotte were a couple.

29:08.410 --> 29:10.332
(Hanna)
That must be why they came here.

29:10.340 --> 29:13.047
No chance of running
into anyone they knew.

29:13.050 --> 29:14.403
Well, if he was in love with her

29:14.420 --> 29:16.570
that would explain
why he's working with Mary.

29:16.580 --> 29:18.172
Yeah, but why would
he marry Alison?

29:19.290 --> 29:21.087
I don't know.

29:21.090 --> 29:23.957
Seems like he's the one who
should be locked up in Welby.

29:30.260 --> 29:32.091
Hanna, what is it?

29:36.040 --> 29:37.359
[screaming]

29:37.370 --> 29:38.359
Please!

29:40.240 --> 29:40.763
Hanna?

29:44.280 --> 29:47.306
Oh, no.
No, no, no!

29:47.310 --> 29:48.607
Please, stop!

29:52.050 --> 29:53.608
That's what he used on me.

29:58.630 --> 30:01.519
A cattle prod? Oh, my God!

30:02.630 --> 30:03.722
Hanna?

30:06.830 --> 30:08.058
I'm so sorry.

30:10.940 --> 30:13.135
It's ﬁne.

30:13.140 --> 30:15.836
I'm fine. Ali's the one
who needs help now.

30:15.840 --> 30:17.831
No, he's not gonna
get away with this.

30:17.850 --> 30:20.205
Elliott will pay for what
he did to you. I promise.

30:29.090 --> 30:31.854
- 'Hey.‘
- Hi.

30:34.960 --> 30:37.121
You've been in here a while.

30:37.130 --> 30:39.428
Yeah, I'm,
I'm just trying to figure out

30:39.430 --> 30:40.897
what these medications do.

30:47.310 --> 30:48.766
I really think we need to talk
about what happened

30:48.780 --> 30:49.769
this morning.

30:51.110 --> 30:53.044
We will. Later.

30:54.150 --> 30:55.174
Come on, Spence.

30:59.820 --> 31:02.311
Look, I get it, okay?

31:02.320 --> 31:04.117
You're confused.

31:04.120 --> 31:06.350
No. No, I'm not.

31:08.460 --> 31:11.020
Look.

31:11.030 --> 31:12.998
There's a part of me that will
always love Hanna, okay?

31:13.000 --> 31:14.558
'She was my first real love.‘

31:16.640 --> 31:18.232
But it's you I wanna be with.

31:19.510 --> 31:22.604
And if Hanna wanted to be
with you now?

31:24.410 --> 31:27.004
- Would that change things?
- No.

31:27.010 --> 31:29.376
Do you mean that or do you
just feel obligated to say it?

31:30.750 --> 31:31.944
Seriously?

31:35.560 --> 31:37.152
Look, after that time
we spent together in Madrid

31:37.160 --> 31:39.219
I couldn't stop
thinking about you.

31:39.230 --> 31:41.482
And then we met up again in DC

31:41.500 --> 31:42.580
and the more time
we spent together

31:42.600 --> 31:44.591
the more
I wanted to be with you.

31:44.600 --> 31:46.727
I know. Me too.

31:50.170 --> 31:51.660
I like everything about you.

31:53.070 --> 31:55.402
Okay, you're smart,
and you're driven.

31:56.680 --> 31:58.170
You're sew as hell.

31:59.380 --> 32:00.847
Yeah, but that's the problem.

32:02.180 --> 32:03.579
You like me..

32:05.620 --> 32:07.144
...but I love you.

32:10.390 --> 32:11.948
And I-I wanna be with somebody

32:11.960 --> 32:13.757
who thinks about me
the first thing in the morning

32:13.760 --> 32:15.751
and the last thing at night.

32:26.410 --> 32:29.163
Look, things just got
really off track.

32:30.080 --> 32:31.536
Okay, just..

32:34.250 --> 32:37.276
Please give me a chance
to make it, to make it right.

32:40.620 --> 32:42.485
I really want this to work.

32:45.730 --> 32:47.379
I don't know that I can.

32:58.310 --> 33:01.529
So please raise your glasses
and toast..

33:02.840 --> 33:05.308
...to the future Mrs. Cavanaugh

33:05.310 --> 33:06.607
before she changes her mind.

33:06.610 --> 33:08.146
[all laughing]

33:12.450 --> 33:14.338
Hey, um,
I'm gonna be right back, okay?

33:14.360 --> 33:15.543
Okay.

33:19.160 --> 33:21.924
Hey. Look,
I'm sorry to interrupt.

33:21.930 --> 33:23.625
I didn't realize
you were doing this tonight.

33:23.630 --> 33:26.258
- Can we just talk tomorrow?
- No, Ali's in trouble.

33:26.270 --> 33:27.623
We think
Elliott's working with Mary.

33:27.630 --> 33:29.769
Yeah, he, isn't he
taking care of her at Welby?

33:29.770 --> 33:31.988
Yes, and that's the problem.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.535
- She killed Charlotte, Em.
- Probably.

33:34.540 --> 33:37.134
But if we can prove that
Elliott's trying to hurt Ali

33:37.140 --> 33:39.279
we can expose AD.

33:39.280 --> 33:40.372
Look into him, please?

33:40.380 --> 33:42.268
See if you can
find out anything.

33:42.280 --> 33:44.271
Okay? And..

33:44.280 --> 33:45.975
[sighs]
Maybe there's something in here

33:45.990 --> 33:47.139
that can help you
find a connection

33:47.150 --> 33:48.583
between Mary and Elliot.

33:51.390 --> 33:53.381
[indistinct chattering]

33:59.800 --> 34:02.166
Okay, I'll call you.

34:02.170 --> 34:04.035
We don't have a lot of time.

34:18.220 --> 34:20.211
[dramatic music]

35:03.230 --> 35:04.458
Things will fall into place

35:04.470 --> 35:06.597
once you and Caleb
get back to DC.

35:08.640 --> 35:10.198
Yeah, I don't think
any of us are getting back

35:10.200 --> 35:11.633
to our normal lives
until we expose

35:11.640 --> 35:13.562
Mary and Elliot.

35:13.570 --> 35:15.959
Well, it's gonna be hard
to prove that he made that mask.

35:15.980 --> 35:17.936
[sighs]
I-I don't think

35:17.950 --> 35:20.748
these medications have anything
to do with Ali's condition.

35:20.750 --> 35:23.378
'And Dr. Freedman said that
she's only taking clozapine.‘

35:23.380 --> 35:25.678
Then why did he have them
locked up with the other things?

35:26.790 --> 35:28.189
That's a good question.

35:33.390 --> 35:36.951
Well, looks like
he only used this one.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.655
And the vial's almost empty.

35:38.670 --> 35:41.719
- That's a stimulant.
- So what do you take it for?

35:41.740 --> 35:45.232
To help you focus,
to stay awake.

35:45.240 --> 35:47.800
- Like speed?
- Yeah.

35:47.810 --> 35:49.664
Yeah, if you use it enough.

35:55.120 --> 35:56.439
"High doses and frequent uses

35:56.450 --> 35:57.747
"can cause hallucinations

35:57.750 --> 36:00.412
delusions and thought disorder."

36:00.420 --> 36:03.617
Dr. Freedman said
that she's only taking one drug.

36:03.620 --> 36:06.783
That doesn't mean that Elliott's
not giving her another.

36:06.790 --> 36:08.985
Ali wasn't crazy
when she went into Welby

36:09.000 --> 36:10.399
but he's making sure she is now.

36:23.180 --> 36:25.171
[dramatic music]

36:34.290 --> 36:36.588
Change of plans, Alison.

36:45.230 --> 36:46.527
We have to go to the police.

36:46.530 --> 36:48.464
What? We've no actual evidence.

36:48.470 --> 36:49.869
She's right.

36:49.870 --> 36:51.292
It's all just speculation
at this point.

36:51.310 --> 36:53.301
We have enough to get them
to look into Elliott.

36:53.310 --> 36:54.902
And once they do,
they'll figure out the rest.

36:54.910 --> 36:56.002
And what about Mary?

36:56.010 --> 36:57.034
We tell them everything we know

36:57.040 --> 36:58.075
about her too.

37:00.350 --> 37:02.568
- Where are you going?
- To get the file.

37:02.580 --> 37:04.343
The more information
they have on her, the better.

37:04.350 --> 37:06.739
- It's gone.
- Where did you put it?

37:06.750 --> 37:08.342
I-I don't know, I had it with me
when I went to Toby's

37:08.360 --> 37:09.645
this morning.

37:10.690 --> 37:12.487
I took it.

37:12.490 --> 37:13.889
I gave it to Toby.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.491
I asked you not to involve him.

37:17.500 --> 37:20.389
Ali's life trumps
what you want, Spencer.

37:22.770 --> 37:24.192
Okay, you know what?

37:24.200 --> 37:25.497
I'm starting to think
it's a bad idea

37:25.510 --> 37:26.568
to go to the cops.

37:26.570 --> 37:27.605
Why?

37:27.610 --> 37:28.907
Because if we do

37:28.910 --> 37:30.070
we have to tell them that Mary

37:30.080 --> 37:31.274
and Elliott are after Alison

37:31.280 --> 37:33.373
because she killed Charlotte.

37:33.380 --> 37:36.076
Oh. We'd be implicating her
in the murder.

37:36.080 --> 37:38.412
Uh, Elliott just sent me a text.

37:38.420 --> 37:39.842
It's a pin drop of his location.

37:39.850 --> 37:41.386
How does he have your number?

37:41.390 --> 37:42.948
I gave it to him
when I was looking after Ali.

37:42.960 --> 37:45.212
Let me see.

37:45.230 --> 37:48.279
Okay, he's at Welby.
The pin just started to move.

37:48.300 --> 37:50.097
(Aria)
'Why does he want us to know
where he's going?‘

37:50.100 --> 37:52.398
He must know that we're
on to him. This must be a trap.

37:52.400 --> 37:53.424
[cell phone beeps]

37:53.430 --> 37:54.522
What does it say?

37:54.530 --> 37:56.361
(Aria)
"'SOS."'

37:56.370 --> 37:58.292
Guys, I don't think this is
Elliott sending the text.

37:58.310 --> 37:59.937
I think Alison is.

37:59.940 --> 38:02.261
She wants us to know
that he's taking her somewhere.

38:28.670 --> 38:29.967
[keyboard keys clacking]

38:35.580 --> 38:37.673
Hey.

38:37.680 --> 38:38.977
I thought you were saying bye

38:38.980 --> 38:40.402
to your Aunt Cathy
and Uncle Joe.

38:40.410 --> 38:41.809
Uh, I did, but then

38:41.820 --> 38:43.640
um, something came up with work.

38:43.650 --> 38:45.777
'I just need to look into it.'

38:45.790 --> 38:48.247
Does this have anything to do
with why Emily was here?

38:49.790 --> 38:51.951
No, um, she just came by.

38:51.960 --> 38:54.326
She wanted to let me know
Alison was doing okay.

38:55.360 --> 38:56.384
That's good.

39:02.370 --> 39:04.930
I'm ready for bed.
I was hoping you'd join me.

39:06.640 --> 39:08.961
Mm.

39:08.980 --> 39:10.208
I guess I gotta get used

39:10.210 --> 39:12.804
to being
a police officer's wife.

39:12.810 --> 39:15.449
I will be in

39:15.450 --> 39:17.372
as soon as I can.

39:22.390 --> 39:24.381
[keyboard keys clacking]

39:40.640 --> 39:41.868
1958?

39:52.090 --> 39:53.114
[cell phone beeps]

39:54.690 --> 39:56.885
He's making a turn
at Old Nichols Road.

39:56.890 --> 39:58.881
He's headed for the lake.

39:58.890 --> 40:00.084
Wait, there's a shortcut
to get there.

40:00.090 --> 40:02.251
- Take a right up here.
- 'Okay.'

40:29.890 --> 40:32.017
- Oh, I lost signal.
- We're gonna lose them.

40:32.030 --> 40:33.657
No, just keep driving
in this direction.

40:37.700 --> 40:39.292
[tires bursting]

40:39.300 --> 40:40.699

[tires squealing]

40:43.700 --> 40:44.837
[groans]

40:59.550 --> 41:01.916
Okay, I got bars back.

41:01.920 --> 41:03.478
Elliott's car stopped moving.

41:03.490 --> 41:04.957
Yeah, but they're only
half a mile ahead of us.

41:25.780 --> 41:26.804
Watch out!

41:26.810 --> 41:28.004

Oh, my God.
