<i>(male narrator)</i>
<i>In the criminal</i>
<i>justice system...</i>

00:25.458 --> 00:29.087
<i>the people are represented</i>
<i>by two separate</i>
<i>yet equally important groups:</i>

00:29.162 --> 00:31.062
<i>The police</i>
<i>who investigate crime...</i>

00:31.131 --> 00:33.895
<i>and the district attorneys</i>

00:33.967 --> 00:35.696
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:54.521 --> 00:55.749
[Door creaking]

00:57.223 --> 00:58.554
Mildred?

01:03.329 --> 01:05.422
Mildred,
are you all right?

01:22.582 --> 01:23.981
Oh, my God.

01:25.385 --> 01:26.875
Mildred?

01:33.793 --> 01:35.021
(Edna)
Mildred.

01:36.996 --> 01:39.829
We took the call.
Found the door jimmied.

01:41.868 --> 01:43.927
Bashed in
is more like it.

01:44.204 --> 01:47.037
Neighbors?
Nobody home.
Everybody works.

01:47.774 --> 01:51.335
Went through the place
hit or miss.
Dialing for dollars.

01:52.312 --> 01:53.779
[Police radio chattering]

01:55.682 --> 01:57.912
They didn't bother
breaking this drawer open.

01:57.984 --> 02:00.009
Maybe something
scared them off.

02:00.587 --> 02:02.316
It sure wasrt her.

02:05.291 --> 02:07.418
Mildred Bauer,
82.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.794
Bruises on her arms,
cut along her jaw.

02:11.931 --> 02:14.832
Think the burglar
knocked her around?
Or she fell.

02:14.901 --> 02:16.163
(Briscoe)
Is this her?

02:16.836 --> 02:19.361
Looks like she
lost about 30 pounds.

02:19.506 --> 02:23.408
Yeah, well, there's no way
she put up much of a struggle.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.946
Would you check
the bottom drawer
of the dresser?

02:27.013 --> 02:28.810
Ma'am, you really ought
to let us take you in.

02:28.882 --> 02:32.784
That's where she kept
her jewelry, and you'll need
to know what's missing.

02:32.852 --> 02:35.343
If you don't let us
take you in, I'm gonna
ask you to sign this.

02:35.421 --> 02:39.585
I gave her
a pair of Georgian
silver candlesticks...

02:39.659 --> 02:43.959
eight Christmases ago.
No, 10 Christmases ago.
They're gone.

02:44.397 --> 02:48.891
And as for her furs, she <i>...</i>
Oh, that's right.

02:49.202 --> 02:50.464
Oh, she, uh...

02:50.537 --> 02:53.597
She gave them away.
Ma'am, are you sure
you're all right?

02:53.673 --> 02:57.336
No. But I'm alive.

03:47.860 --> 03:52.126
Old people living alone,
get sick, fall down.

03:52.398 --> 03:53.422
<i>Sayonara.</i>

03:53.499 --> 03:55.364
This one may have
had some help.

03:55.435 --> 03:58.029
Her apartment was broken into.
What, the bruises?

03:58.104 --> 04:01.301
Don't jump to conclusions.
People her age get them
rolling over in bed.

04:01.374 --> 04:02.739
Well, what about
a heart attack?

04:02.809 --> 04:04.834
I mean, the intruder
scares her, that's homicide.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.812
She looks like
the poster girl for about
six different diseases.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.848
A heart attack
might have been redundant.

04:09.916 --> 04:13.909
How about time of death?
At least 12 hours.

04:14.887 --> 04:16.911
You'll get
my report on Tuesday.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.286
[Phone rings]

04:18.358 --> 04:20.622
Morgue. Yeah?

04:21.594 --> 04:23.084
Hold them there.

04:23.463 --> 04:25.488
Waiting room. Next of kin.

04:26.699 --> 04:30.897
Laura and I begged her
to get out of that apartment
and go into a home.

04:30.970 --> 04:33.200
We found one,
a nice one.

04:35.041 --> 04:37.271
My mother-in-law
was stubborn.

04:37.443 --> 04:41.004
Even my dad,
when he was alive,
tried to get her to move.

04:41.614 --> 04:44.811
She heard "nursing home,"
it meant she was gonna die.

04:44.884 --> 04:47.785
To think someone
killed her for that stuff.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.956
There was
nothing valuable.

04:51.024 --> 04:54.118
Do you know <i>...</i>
Were there any delivery people
or anybody...

04:54.193 --> 04:57.458
who might have known
that she was living
there alone?

04:57.830 --> 05:00.424
She didn't.
I hired a live-in for her.

05:00.500 --> 05:03.901
Didrt you talk to Maria?
There was no one
in the apartment.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.460
Maybe she
was running errands.

05:05.538 --> 05:07.597
There was no sign
of anybody else
living there.

05:07.674 --> 05:11.440
I saw Maria on Tuesday.
She and Grans
were playing checkers.

05:12.912 --> 05:14.436
Maria Gonzales.

05:14.614 --> 05:17.583
(Briscoe)
Do you have an address?
She lived in.

05:19.652 --> 05:23.383
Maria Gonzales. Dominican.
She was paid in cash.

05:24.257 --> 05:27.249
There's no address.
She's probably illegal.
Good luck.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.921
You want to knock
on every door
in Washington Heights?

05:29.996 --> 05:32.123
You want to let it sit?
I wouldn't mind
checking out...

05:32.198 --> 05:33.631
the new Thunderbirds
at the auto show.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.463
All we've got for sure
is a B and E.

05:35.535 --> 05:37.435
And she lived there.
Why would she break in?

05:37.503 --> 05:39.937
Right, she lived there.
So where the hell is she?

05:40.006 --> 05:42.065
She was supposed
to be taking care of the lady.

05:42.141 --> 05:45.008
She's probably taking care
of another old lady right now.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.545
Illegals
don't like trouble.

05:46.612 --> 05:50.104
She's out shopping,
comes back, the lady's dead,
she takes off.

05:50.383 --> 05:52.351
Maybe she got tired
of being a maid...

05:52.418 --> 05:55.216
and decided to give herself
a little farewell bonus.

05:55.288 --> 05:58.257
You want to find a maid,
talk to other maids.

05:58.925 --> 06:01.257
(Antoinette)
She is Dominica, I am Haitian.

06:01.327 --> 06:03.227
We are not friends at home,
or here.

06:03.296 --> 06:06.322
I didn't ask if you
sent her valentines.
I just asked if you know her.

06:06.399 --> 06:09.266
She worked for a Mrs. Bauer.
Lived in that building there.

06:09.335 --> 06:12.202
No, I don't think so.
All right. Thanks.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.971
I'm looking for a girl
named Maria. She's a maid.
I think she hangs out here.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.670
[Speaking Spanish]

06:18.811 --> 06:22.178
That one doesn't speak
English. That one
doesn't like Dominicans.

06:22.248 --> 06:24.011
How about this one?
She doesn't do windows?

06:24.083 --> 06:26.142
No, this one doesn't know
any Marias. Right?

06:26.219 --> 06:27.618
No. No Marias.

06:27.687 --> 06:30.485
That lady that was killed,
are you investigating that?

06:30.556 --> 06:31.921
Yes, we are, ma'am.

06:31.991 --> 06:35.859
Rosa, you remember
Mildred Bauer.
I used to talk to her.

06:35.928 --> 06:39.830
No, I don't remember.
(Mrs. Silverman)
You know her, Rosa.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.158
The skinny lady
with the kidney.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.829
Maybe we better talk this over
down at the INS.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.202
You do have your green card,
don't you?

06:47.273 --> 06:50.765
You want Maria Gonzales?
I'll tell you
where she's staying.

06:50.843 --> 06:54.301
She's staying
with my boyfriend,
Felix Ortega.

06:55.081 --> 06:57.879
Write it in your book.
She took him away.

07:01.854 --> 07:03.082
[Knocking on door]

07:05.258 --> 07:06.418
[Speaking foreign language]

07:06.492 --> 07:08.084
What do you want?

07:08.227 --> 07:09.353
Maria Gonzales.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.521
[Speaking foreign language]

07:11.831 --> 07:12.957
We can wait.

07:13.032 --> 07:14.056
(Maria)
Felix?

07:21.307 --> 07:23.537
You are here
about Mrs. Bauer.

07:24.377 --> 07:26.777
I am very sorry for her.
(Briscoe)
Really?

07:26.846 --> 07:30.145
How'd you know there was
anything to be sorry about?

07:31.350 --> 07:34.478
I have friends who work
on that street. They told me.

07:34.554 --> 07:37.523
Werert you supposed to be
with Mrs. Bauer when she died?

07:37.590 --> 07:39.717
No. Not after Tuesday.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.521
What happened
after Tuesday?

07:41.594 --> 07:44.188
You get distracted?
They fire me.

07:44.263 --> 07:48.666
Mrs. Bauer fired you?
Not Mrs. Bauer,
her granddaughter.

07:48.868 --> 07:50.699
You werert there yesterday?

07:52.605 --> 07:54.197
You mind if we come in
and look around?

07:54.273 --> 07:56.138
You got a warrant?
I know the law.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.439
Look, we don't find anything,
you're in the clear.

07:58.511 --> 08:00.536
Yeah, don't do us
any favors.

08:00.947 --> 08:05.111
Hey, did we forget to mention?
Your other girlfriend said hi.

08:05.885 --> 08:09.013
Maria said I fired her?
That's crazy.

08:12.124 --> 08:15.389
Oh, my God, she must have
robbed the place.

08:16.762 --> 08:20.163
But why would she hurt Grans?
Did your grandmother ever...

08:22.134 --> 08:24.898
Sorry. I'm hungry.

08:28.207 --> 08:30.505
The last couple of months,
my mother and I noticed...

08:30.576 --> 08:33.238
some things missing
from the apartment.

08:33.312 --> 08:36.543
Nothing much.
An old radio, a winter coat.

08:36.616 --> 08:38.515
Wouldrt that be
a reason to fire her?

08:38.583 --> 08:41.451
It was small stuff.
My grandmother
was incontinent.

08:41.821 --> 08:42.913
You know what that means.

08:42.989 --> 08:45.958
It's not easy to find people
to take care of someone
like that.

08:46.025 --> 08:49.722
You didn't think
Maria's stealing was
won'th mentioning before...

08:49.795 --> 08:54.164
when we're investigating
a burglary that's connected to
your grandmother's death?

08:54.867 --> 08:59.201
I guess so.
But Maria lives there.
You said someone broke in.

09:01.340 --> 09:04.935
The maid's boyfriend,
the lovely and appealing
Felix Ortega...

09:05.711 --> 09:07.702
two burglary convictions.

09:08.247 --> 09:11.648
What about
Laura's boyfriend? Think
we ought to check him out?

09:12.518 --> 09:13.507
Why?

09:13.653 --> 09:16.247
I want to know who's
associating with the suspect.

09:16.322 --> 09:17.812
Since when
is she a suspect?

09:17.890 --> 09:21.417
Now that you know the maid
was stealing, you get a search
warrant for the asking.

09:21.494 --> 09:24.622
Well, why didn't she mention
the maid was stealing
until we asked?

09:24.697 --> 09:28.394
And tell me again,
why would the maid break
into the place she lived?

09:28.467 --> 09:33.370
To throw us off the scent?
Is Maria Gonzales
actually that smart?

09:33.873 --> 09:36.433
Or did Laura Bauer fire her
and take away her key?

09:36.509 --> 09:40.240
An old lady wetting her pants?
You don't fire somebody
who's willing to clean up.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.975
Even if they do walk off
with the occasional ashtray.

09:43.049 --> 09:44.607
My old man got
pretty hard to handle...

09:44.684 --> 09:46.982
when he started thinking
my mother was trying
to poison him.

09:47.053 --> 09:48.020
Alzheimer's?
Yeah.

09:48.087 --> 09:50.351
Couldrt stop him
from throwing his dinner
in the toilet...

09:50.423 --> 09:51.549
and eating birdseed.

09:51.624 --> 09:55.060
I told Mike, if I ever
start to drift, to take my gun
and shoot me.

09:55.127 --> 09:58.096
You got nothing better to do,
you hassle a Dominican?

09:58.264 --> 10:00.732
Hey, everyone
needs a hobby.

10:03.502 --> 10:07.495
$400? Somebody been
to the pawn shop
since yesterday?

10:07.573 --> 10:09.803
I work the trucks.
I save my money.

10:10.343 --> 10:11.867
"Rafeal Nava...

10:12.778 --> 10:15.645
"Barahona,
República Dominicana."

10:17.350 --> 10:19.477
My nephew.
For his birthday.

10:20.753 --> 10:24.314
You're gonna have to buy some
more brown wrapping paper.

10:33.733 --> 10:37.863
See, what we have here
is one of those
little cultural differences.

10:41.674 --> 10:45.075
Now, I gave my nephew
a baseball mitt.

10:46.979 --> 10:48.378
That's them.

10:49.048 --> 10:52.449
I know that Mildred told her
to polish these once a week...

10:52.518 --> 10:54.986
but they haven't been
polished in months.

10:55.054 --> 10:56.612
Now, you're
absolutely certain...

10:56.689 --> 10:59.317
that these are
the candlesticks
you gave to Mildred Bauer?

10:59.392 --> 11:02.725
Well, just because I'm old,
Detective, doesn't mean
I'm senile.

11:02.795 --> 11:04.990
Maria tells us that Mrs. Bauer
gave them to her.

11:05.064 --> 11:07.589
If she gave them to anyone
she'd give them
to her granddaughter.

11:07.667 --> 11:08.531
They were very close.

11:08.601 --> 11:10.796
She ever tell you
she was gonna give them
to Laura?

11:10.870 --> 11:13.202
She didn't tell me anything
the last few weeks.

11:13.272 --> 11:15.536
I'd go to visit, and the maid
wouldn't let me in.

11:15.608 --> 11:18.577
She said Mildred
couldn't be disturbed.

11:19.045 --> 11:23.448
The only thing that disturbed
Mildred was a Democrat
in the White House.

11:25.251 --> 11:27.947
It's your basic
"he said, she said,"
Detective.

11:28.287 --> 11:31.085
Miss Gonzales says
that Mrs. Bauer gave her
the candlesticks.

11:31.157 --> 11:33.352
Now there's no one alive
that says she didn't.

11:33.426 --> 11:36.589
Which kind of brings us
to the main event, Counselor.

11:36.662 --> 11:38.323
Regarding
Mrs. Bauer's death...

11:38.397 --> 11:41.525
Miss Gonzales is prepared
to cooperate completely.

11:41.634 --> 11:43.829
Really? She's gonna give us
her boyfriend?

11:43.903 --> 11:47.634
Laura caught me giving
Mrs. Bauer
extra food and water.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.072
She told me not to.

11:49.141 --> 11:51.871
She told you
not to feed her grandmother?

11:51.944 --> 11:54.310
She said give her
just a little water...

11:54.380 --> 11:57.508
spread the food around
on the plate
so it looks like more.

11:57.583 --> 11:59.608
I did, but she was hungry.

11:59.919 --> 12:03.377
She was so thin.
I tried to give her more.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.817
Miss Bauer came in and saw.

12:07.226 --> 12:10.525
She was very angry.
(Logan)
You were fired, right?

12:12.798 --> 12:14.459
Well, how'd you
feel about that?

12:14.533 --> 12:17.627
I was worried.
I knew she wouldn't feed her.

12:20.172 --> 12:22.367
I went on Friday with Felix.

12:23.275 --> 12:24.902
We knocked on the door.

12:25.277 --> 12:27.108
Mrs. Bauer didn't come.

12:28.280 --> 12:30.043
Felix broke it open.

12:31.217 --> 12:32.582
We saw her.

12:34.053 --> 12:35.714
We knew she was dead.

12:35.788 --> 12:39.747
And you looted the place.
No. We didn't take anything.

12:42.027 --> 12:45.463
I didn't believe it, either,
till she showed me these.

12:51.837 --> 12:53.930
"One chopped, cooked carrot.

12:55.241 --> 12:56.833
"Half a potato only."

12:56.909 --> 12:59.571
Laura Bauer left them
on the refrigerator.

12:59.645 --> 13:03.137
Little reminders to starve
her grandmother to death.

13:12.158 --> 13:14.422
"Only one cup
of water today."

13:14.894 --> 13:17.761
You sure the maid wasrt
over-watering the plants?

13:17.830 --> 13:20.128
It wasrt the plants
that died.

13:21.767 --> 13:25.464
When my old man lost his mind,
I never thought of starvation
as a solution.

13:25.538 --> 13:28.996
Well, the maid still has
a little credibility problem.

13:29.108 --> 13:32.635
You think she made this up?
That's a hell of
an imagination.

13:32.711 --> 13:34.474
ME's report
was due this morning.

13:34.547 --> 13:36.947
Before we go after a grieving
relative for murder...

13:37.016 --> 13:40.315
why don't we make sure
we know how Mrs. Bauer died?

13:40.686 --> 13:44.782
You wanted me to look
for trauma. Nothing.
For a heart attack. Nothing.

13:44.857 --> 13:48.122
Well, what were we supposed
to think? She was found dead
during a break-in.

13:48.194 --> 13:52.221
She was found dead during
the war in Bosnia, too, but
that didn't kill her, either.

13:52.298 --> 13:55.961
Hypotension, diminished
organ size, kidney shutdown...

13:56.202 --> 13:57.999
these are all signs
of dehydration.

13:58.070 --> 14:00.061
How was she eating?
She wasrt.

14:00.139 --> 14:04.200
High levels of amino
and fatty acids in her plasma.
She was catabolizing muscle.

14:04.276 --> 14:06.267
So she was starved to death.
Absolutely.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.643
Unless she didn't have
an appetite, because she
was sick...

14:08.714 --> 14:10.841
or she didn't want to eat,
'cause she was depressed.

14:10.916 --> 14:12.577
Well, don't go
out on a limb.

14:12.651 --> 14:16.314
Look, I can tell you how she
ended up. I can't tell you
how she got that way.

14:16.388 --> 14:18.788
But she definitely
starved to death.

14:19.625 --> 14:21.490
Why are you
asking me?

14:21.961 --> 14:24.691
You found Maria.
She had
my grandmother's things.

14:24.763 --> 14:27.561
Laura, your grandmother
didn't die during
the burglary.

14:27.633 --> 14:31.330
She died of a lack of
food and water.
You recognize these?

14:37.376 --> 14:41.540
What are you saying?
Do you think I neglected
my grandmother?

14:41.614 --> 14:44.412
I'm just asking
if the handwriting
looks familiar.

14:44.483 --> 14:48.317
Yeah, I wrote them.
I had to give Maria
specific instructions.

14:48.954 --> 14:52.014
You admit you told Maria
to restrict
your grandmother's food?

14:52.091 --> 14:54.321
She was feeding her
empanadas.

14:54.593 --> 14:57.858
All those spicy sauces.
Was the water spicy, too?

14:57.963 --> 14:59.863
Her intake
had to be monitored.

14:59.932 --> 15:03.060
Liquid balance was very
difficult with her condition.

15:03.135 --> 15:04.261
Her condition?

15:04.336 --> 15:08.170
My grandmother had pneumonia
last spring.
It led to a kidney problem.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.906
Did you make
that diagnosis yourself?

15:11.977 --> 15:15.879
No, Dr. Matthewson did.
He's on East 56th Street.

15:16.782 --> 15:19.649
She had arthritis.
I had her on painkillers.

15:20.185 --> 15:23.882
Last year she broke a hip,
spent six weeks
in the hospital.

15:24.757 --> 15:29.023
This year, pneumonia,
then acute kidney disease.

15:29.228 --> 15:32.197
Did you tell the granddaughter
to restrict her water?

15:32.498 --> 15:36.491
To minimize fluid retention.
She had to watch
her protein intake, too.

15:38.003 --> 15:41.439
These diet restrictions,
how long were they
supposed to last?

15:41.507 --> 15:43.634
Depends on how
the case progresses.

15:43.742 --> 15:46.142
How did
Mrs. Bauer's case progress?

15:48.314 --> 15:51.681
I'm afraid I don't know.
She missed her appointments.

15:51.750 --> 15:55.709
Don't you take some kind of
an oath to follow up on
the treatment of sick people?

15:55.788 --> 15:57.380
My receptionist called.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.754
She was told Mrs. Bauer
was seeing another doctor.

15:59.825 --> 16:01.554
Told by Mrs. Bauer?

16:02.227 --> 16:04.024
By her granddaughter.

16:05.698 --> 16:07.723
So the medical excuse
holds up.

16:07.800 --> 16:12.260
Yeah, but Laura Bauer said
her grandmother
was seeing another doctor.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.330
No one asked the old doctor
for her records.

16:15.407 --> 16:17.671
So she took her home
and left her there.

16:17.743 --> 16:21.201
And applied
the low-protein diet
a little overenthusiastically.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.874
Come on, Mike.
You really believe
that girl did it on purpose?

16:23.949 --> 16:26.941
The old lady was left alone.
There was no food
in that apartment.

16:27.019 --> 16:29.146
The maid didn't have a motive
to starve or kill her.

16:29.221 --> 16:31.621
Okay, what's
the granddaughter's motive?

16:32.024 --> 16:34.515
Some old ladies
have bank accounts.

16:34.793 --> 16:37.489
The granddaughter is an heir.
To what?

16:41.633 --> 16:43.225
Mildred, rich?
What's rich?

16:43.302 --> 16:46.396
Anything with six zeros.
Not Mildred.

16:46.472 --> 16:49.407
A couple of hundred grand
in bonds. All left to charity.

16:49.475 --> 16:52.444
So Laura Bauer didn't stand
to inerit a dime?

16:52.511 --> 16:55.480
What about Laura's mother?
No love lost there.

16:55.547 --> 16:59.074
When Mildred's son
divorced her, she got enough
for a summer wardrobe...

16:59.151 --> 17:01.244
and a few lunches
at Schraft's.

17:01.320 --> 17:04.346
Okay, so the old lady
wasrt crazy about
Laura or her mother.

17:04.423 --> 17:06.857
She liked Laura once she
started taking care of her.

17:06.925 --> 17:10.486
Set up an education fund.
Laura's planning on
law school.

17:10.796 --> 17:14.527
Mildred liked to slip her
a little extra.
Bought her a BMW.

17:14.599 --> 17:16.795
A little extra?
Used.

17:16.969 --> 17:20.301
Now wait a minute.
Did Laura know
she wasrt ineriting?

17:20.372 --> 17:22.839
I mean, maybe she figured
she was getting something.

17:22.907 --> 17:25.934
Video will. I use it
with my elderly clients...

17:26.979 --> 17:29.914
to demonstrate competence.

17:30.649 --> 17:33.083
<i>Where am I</i>
<i>supposed to look, dear?</i>
<i>Over there, Grans...</i>

17:33.152 --> 17:34.813
(Briscoe)
There's Laura
right there, Mike.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.582
I guess she knew
what she wasrt getting.

17:36.655 --> 17:40.022
Laura didn't need
Mildred's money.
She was going to law school...

17:40.092 --> 17:42.686
and Mildred said that she
brought over her fiancé...

17:42.761 --> 17:45.457
Kent Halliwell,
a fine old Boston name.

17:45.998 --> 17:48.592
Mildred was
a bit of a snob. Here.

17:50.502 --> 17:53.369
<i>I give and bequeath</i>
<i>my entire estate...</i>

17:53.739 --> 17:56.572
<i>to United Charities</i>
<i>of Manattan.</i>

17:57.443 --> 17:59.468
Mildred was old-fashioned.

18:00.379 --> 18:02.370
She took care
of Laura's education.

18:02.448 --> 18:06.680
Beyond that, she thought
inerited money
made people soft.

18:08.487 --> 18:11.479
If anything, the kid had
a motive to keep
the old lady alive.

18:11.557 --> 18:14.321
When she went,
so did all the goodies.
I don't know.

18:14.393 --> 18:17.885
How about if we prove
Laura Bauer was lying
to her grandmother?

18:17.963 --> 18:20.397
Then would you
buy she's lying to us?

18:20.466 --> 18:22.093
About the fiancé?

18:22.234 --> 18:26.898
You think that black guy she's
shacking up with is from
a fine old Boston family?

18:27.139 --> 18:28.470
Black Irish.

18:28.540 --> 18:32.408
What'd the lawyer say
the fiancé's name was?
Kent Halliwell?

18:32.478 --> 18:35.936
What you say we find
Mr. Halliwell?
Check out his tan.

18:39.485 --> 18:42.750
Laura and I are friends, sure.
What's this about?

18:42.821 --> 18:45.483
We heard that you were
engaged, right?

18:45.657 --> 18:48.854
Well, no.
I mean, not really.

18:49.828 --> 18:51.193
We went out for a while.

18:51.263 --> 18:53.754
Then you know that Laura's
going out with someone else,
right?

18:53.832 --> 18:56.801
Well, so am I. But we still
see each other sometimes.

18:57.703 --> 18:59.967
What does this have to do
with her grandmother's death?

19:00.038 --> 19:01.699
It was that maid, wasrt it?

19:01.773 --> 19:05.140
Did you tell Mrs. Bauer
that you were Laura's fiancé?

19:09.948 --> 19:11.472
I liked the old lady.

19:11.550 --> 19:14.075
She was sick, and Laura said
it would cheer her up.

19:14.153 --> 19:18.556
Hey, I want to cheer up an old
lady, I buy her a 10-year
subscription to <i>TV Guide.</i>

19:18.624 --> 19:20.216
She was dying...

19:20.626 --> 19:23.993
and she wanted to feel
like her life meant something.

19:24.396 --> 19:26.728
That the Bauers
would carry on.

19:26.965 --> 19:29.399
She told her we loved
that awful apartment...

19:29.468 --> 19:31.800
and that we couldn't wait
to live in it
after we were married.

19:31.870 --> 19:35.567
Which would be when? Never?
She was dying.

19:36.108 --> 19:38.668
She liked to hear that
Laura was doing well.

19:39.077 --> 19:40.874
Laura told her
she was going to law school.

19:40.946 --> 19:42.413
She wasrt going
to law school?

19:42.481 --> 19:44.779
Look, she was just trying
to make her feel better.

19:44.850 --> 19:48.251
I mean, what does it matter?
She loved Laura.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.614
She even left her that
apartment, for God's sake.

19:57.996 --> 19:59.554
Here, three months ago.

19:59.631 --> 20:03.624
"Mildred Bauer and Laura Bauer
became tenants in common...

20:03.702 --> 20:06.466
"with right of survivorship."
Co-owners.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.197
So the apartment
wasrt in the estate.

20:09.274 --> 20:11.299
Remember Halliwell said
she told her grandmother...

20:11.376 --> 20:13.867
they wanted to live there
after they got married?

20:13.946 --> 20:17.211
The old lady signed it over.
Maybe not a wise move.

20:17.282 --> 20:19.876
Yeah, tell me about it.
I did it before
my second divorce.

20:19.952 --> 20:21.385
That's why I
can't go home, anymore.

20:21.453 --> 20:25.617
Hey, this girl works fast.
The bank filed
a UCC-1 yesterday.

20:26.258 --> 20:29.352
Laura has already borrowed
against the property.

20:30.295 --> 20:34.129
Still think she was
an innocent bystander?
Okay, maybe not.

20:35.100 --> 20:38.126
"Westside Financial,
$75,000."

20:38.203 --> 20:40.694
Now that buys
a pretty nice funeral wreath.

20:40.772 --> 20:43.002
Let's get a subpoena
for her checking account...

20:43.075 --> 20:45.441
and find out what else
was on her shopping list.

20:48.180 --> 20:50.205
She gave you a check
for $60,000.

20:50.282 --> 20:52.648
Yeah, the minimum
for limited partners.

20:53.185 --> 20:56.712
It was a good investment,
so I offered Laura
a chance to get in.

20:57.055 --> 20:59.319
Hey, arugula salad, $12.

20:59.391 --> 21:02.883
She'll make her money
back in a week.
Maybe a year.

21:03.929 --> 21:07.296
Body-healthy food presented
with style. People like it.

21:07.532 --> 21:10.831
Sounds like it was lucky
for Laura her grandmother
died when she did.

21:10.902 --> 21:12.665
She was pretty old.

21:12.804 --> 21:17.537
How'd Laura take the news?
She was sad.
They were very close.

21:18.176 --> 21:20.167
The other night, Thursday,
we were going to a club...

21:20.245 --> 21:23.146
Laura insisted on stopping
to check on her grandmother.

21:23.215 --> 21:25.274
Thursday? You sure?
Yeah.

21:25.550 --> 21:28.314
Did you go in with her?
We waited in the car.

21:28.387 --> 21:31.356
She came back.
She said her grandmother
was sleeping.

21:31.857 --> 21:32.949
Why?

21:33.625 --> 21:37.026
Look at the timing,
Miss Kincaid. Thursday night.

21:37.496 --> 21:42.160
The maid was fired on Tuesday.
If she fired the maid.

21:42.234 --> 21:45.726
It doesn't matter. Laura's
the one we know
who's been lying to us.

21:45.804 --> 21:47.897
She said she hadrt been there
since Tuesday.

21:47.973 --> 21:51.875
The maid and her boyfriend
came calling on Friday.
The old lady was dead.

21:51.943 --> 21:54.844
You sure she wasrt
still alive, and they
didn't finish her off?

21:54.913 --> 21:57.404
They werert there long enough
to starve her to death.

21:57.482 --> 22:01.248
Worse case, she was
almost dead,
they did nothing to help.

22:01.320 --> 22:04.050
You're saying when
the granddaughter stopped by
Thursday night...

22:04.122 --> 22:06.056
that she was definitely
still alive?

22:06.124 --> 22:08.592
Laura left the beautiful
people outside...

22:08.660 --> 22:12.027
and ran in to check and see
if her grandmother
was dead yet.

22:12.097 --> 22:15.066
If she'd have been dead
already, Laura would've
packed the body off...

22:15.133 --> 22:17.226
to the funeral home,
case closed.

22:17.302 --> 22:21.295
But she's still alive,
starving, and Laura runs off
to the disco.

22:22.140 --> 22:26.201
Tough case. No weapon.
More omission than commission.

22:26.278 --> 22:30.237
What's tough about it?
She starved
an 82-year-old woman to death.

22:31.083 --> 22:35.247
Depraved indifference
to human life. It's homicide.

22:37.389 --> 22:38.856
Bring her in.

22:47.632 --> 22:50.260
Detective, what are you...
Laura Bauer,
you're under arrest...

22:50.335 --> 22:51.768
for the murder
of Mildred Bauer.

22:51.837 --> 22:53.429
You have the right
to remain silent.

22:53.505 --> 22:56.338
Anything you say can
and will be used against you
in a court of law.

22:56.408 --> 22:57.602
Do you understand that?

22:57.676 --> 23:00.474
You have the right
to an attorney.
Should you refuse <i>...</i>

23:02.814 --> 23:05.840
Look, Mildred Bauer
had diabetes, arthritis...

23:05.917 --> 23:08.044
heart condition,
high blood pressure...

23:08.120 --> 23:10.315
and kidneys you could have
used as doorstops.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.755
What I'm saying, Ben,
is that she died
of natural causes.

23:12.824 --> 23:16.988
Starvation is a natural cause
in Somalia. In New York City,
it's murder two.

23:17.062 --> 23:18.791
Come on, Ben.
She lied to her grandmother.

23:18.864 --> 23:20.422
She lied to
her grandmother's doctor.

23:20.499 --> 23:23.059
She ordered her grandmother's
maid to withhold food.

23:23.135 --> 23:25.103
And now she ends up with
her grandmother's apartment.

23:25.170 --> 23:27.434
Well, she just happens to be
Mrs. Bauer's granddaughter.

23:27.506 --> 23:29.997
Who should the woman give
the apartment to, the PLO?

23:30.075 --> 23:32.168
She might have lived
longer if she had.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.939
I didn't kill Gran.

23:34.045 --> 23:38.914
Look, even if Laura had made
errors in judgment,
which I do not grant...

23:38.984 --> 23:42.579
she, at most, hastened
Mrs. Bauer's inevitable death
by, what...

23:42.654 --> 23:45.020
a matter of weeks?
Days, maybe.

23:45.090 --> 23:48.526
Danielle, do you
remember the bar exam?
Yes.

23:48.593 --> 23:50.959
And, Miss Bauer,
this might interest you.

23:51.029 --> 23:54.021
A woman falls off the top
of the Empire State Building.

23:54.099 --> 23:57.398
She passes the second floor,
where a man shoots her...

23:57.469 --> 24:00.632
and kills her seconds before
she hits the ground.

24:01.139 --> 24:03.664
Is that man guilty?
(Melnick)
Yes.

24:04.276 --> 24:06.039
But what if the man
doesn't shoot her?

24:06.111 --> 24:09.342
What if, as she falls, she
asks him for a ham sandwich...

24:09.414 --> 24:11.939
and he's just a little slow
in handing it to her?

24:12.017 --> 24:14.042
(Stone)
Is that what happened,
Miss Bauer?

24:14.119 --> 24:17.316
You just took your time
feeding your grandmother?

24:17.823 --> 24:20.257
I don't believe
this is happening.

24:20.826 --> 24:24.887
No. I made sure my grandmother
was well-cared for.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.757
You made sure
she didn't eat.

24:26.832 --> 24:29.323
I did what the doctor
told me to do.

24:29.401 --> 24:32.666
I was going to school.
I was trying to have a life.

24:33.505 --> 24:37.601
How many old people did you
take care of while you were
studying for finals?

24:42.647 --> 24:44.376
I was there all the time.

24:44.449 --> 24:48.715
Believe me, Mildred's own
daughter never cared for her
the way Laura and I did.

24:48.987 --> 24:52.753
I didn't know
she had a daughter.
Shirley. Lives in California.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.692
She didn't even come
to the funeral.

24:56.761 --> 25:00.720
You have to understand.
Mildred was
a very difficult person.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.801
She refused to eat.

25:03.869 --> 25:05.393
What I understand is...

25:05.470 --> 25:09.304
your daughter got
Mrs. Bauer's apartment,
and you got nothing.

25:09.808 --> 25:12.003
What's that
supposed to mean?

25:13.411 --> 25:17.177
Maybe I wasrt fond of
Mildred, but I wouldn't want
to see her suffer.

25:17.249 --> 25:20.685
You werert fond of her,
but you helped take care
of her?

25:20.752 --> 25:23.312
At first,
then Laura took over.

25:24.456 --> 25:28.825
Look, Laura was
her grandchild. I was just
her sors ex-wife.

25:29.895 --> 25:32.159
Is Laura as bitter as you are?

25:32.264 --> 25:34.960
I'm not bitter.
I'm realistic.

25:37.235 --> 25:39.635
The mother knows more
than she's willing to say.

25:39.704 --> 25:41.137
Maybe we should push her.

25:41.206 --> 25:45.506
It's a stretch, but we could
indict her as complicit in
neglecting Mrs. Bauer.

25:45.577 --> 25:48.444
Penal Law 26025.

25:49.347 --> 25:51.872
It's only illegal to neglect
an old person...

25:51.950 --> 25:56.785
if the victim's incompetent
because of mental disease
or defect.

25:57.556 --> 25:58.989
A curiosity of the law.

25:59.057 --> 26:03.255
Well, we argue hunger and
thirst affected Mrs. Bauer's
mind before she died.

26:03.328 --> 26:06.388
It's only a misdemeanor.
Greater curiosity of the law.

26:06.498 --> 26:09.763
Murder by starvation, I think
that's enough to move a jury.

26:09.834 --> 26:12.632
Well, be sure you get
one with gray hair.

26:13.038 --> 26:17.304
The young get impatient
with old people, especially
cantankerous ones.

26:17.576 --> 26:20.545
Oh, really? Speaking from
personal experience?

26:21.313 --> 26:23.941
I'm a sweetheart,
and I'm middle-aged.

26:28.520 --> 26:33.219
I don't know anything
about it. All I watch on TV
is the nature shows.

26:33.758 --> 26:37.023
Do you think someone who's
arrested and brought to trial
is probably guilty?

26:37.095 --> 26:40.587
I'm open-minded.
The police make mistakes.

26:41.166 --> 26:43.498
Indeed. Thank you.

26:44.869 --> 26:46.996
Miss Kincaid. Juror 14.

26:49.975 --> 26:52.375
Mr. Stern, are you married?

26:52.777 --> 26:55.143
I'm a widower. Nine years.

26:55.313 --> 26:58.111
So you live alone?
Nine years.

26:58.717 --> 27:01.185
You have children?
Two boys.

27:01.319 --> 27:03.981
A draftsman
and a businessman.

27:04.122 --> 27:05.783
The recycling business.

27:05.857 --> 27:08.348
Have you ever thought about
what arrangements
you would make...

27:08.426 --> 27:11.862
if you were unable
to live alone?
Lf? You mean when.

27:12.297 --> 27:13.423
(Kincaid)
When.

27:13.598 --> 27:18.126
Move in with my kid sister.
West Palm Beach.
She has a room ready.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.229
Okay, thank you.

27:23.008 --> 27:24.236
Miss Melnick?

27:24.309 --> 27:26.971
No questions, Your Honor.
Ready to approach.

27:27.045 --> 27:28.342
Approach.

27:30.482 --> 27:34.145
Your Honor, the People have
only one challenge for cause.

27:34.219 --> 27:35.709
Juror number 6.

27:35.787 --> 27:40.349
The gentleman who said, "God
doesn't want anyone to live
past three score and ten?"

27:40.692 --> 27:41.716
Granted.

27:41.793 --> 27:44.887
No challenges for cause,
Your Honor, but I will
exercise peremptories...

27:44.963 --> 27:47.329
against 2, 11,
and 14.

27:52.303 --> 27:56.103
Jurors 2, 6, 11, and 14...

27:56.441 --> 27:59.535
you are excused, with thanks,
from service here.

28:06.818 --> 28:08.285
Your Honor...

28:08.353 --> 28:12.722
she's removing every juror
over 65 without even bothering
to question them.

28:12.791 --> 28:15.726
They're peremptories, Ben.
I can use them
against anyone I want.

28:15.794 --> 28:18.422
The Supreme Court does not
entirely agree with you,
Danielle.

28:18.496 --> 28:19.520
(Danielle)
Really?

28:19.597 --> 28:21.394
In <i>Georgia v. McCollum:</i>

28:21.466 --> 28:24.162
"White defendants accused
of assaulting blacks...

28:24.235 --> 28:26.294
"cannot exclude
blacks from the jury."

28:26.371 --> 28:30.137
Now we have an old woman
murdered. Old people
are being excluded.

28:30.208 --> 28:31.869
It's an exact parallel.

28:31.943 --> 28:34.844
Are you saying the defendant
isn't getting a jury
of her peers?

28:34.913 --> 28:38.212
I am saying the jury should
represent the community.

28:38.349 --> 28:40.715
People who
look like the victim,
as well as the defendant.

28:40.785 --> 28:43.618
The principle of <i>McCollum</i>
has already been extended
to gender.

28:43.688 --> 28:45.918
It's appropriate for you
to extend it to age.

28:45.990 --> 28:48.925
And I can extend it
to left-handed redheads.

28:49.160 --> 28:51.822
Maybe I'm overly humble,
Counselors...

28:51.896 --> 28:54.956
but I don't feel up to
rewriting the Bill of Rights
this week.

28:55.100 --> 28:57.728
Ben, if your case
is any good...

28:57.802 --> 29:00.464
you can convince jurors
under 65, too.

29:04.309 --> 29:06.038
(Edna)
That Mildred was strong.

29:06.111 --> 29:07.544
When she got pneumonia...

29:07.612 --> 29:11.412
as she asked me to sell
her ticket for that month's
matinee club...

29:11.483 --> 29:14.213
she said she'd be better
in time for <i>Miss Saigon.</i>

29:14.285 --> 29:18.119
And was she?
I don't know.
I went to see her...

29:18.523 --> 29:22.584
and the maid, Spanish girl,
said that she had orders
from Laura...

29:22.660 --> 29:24.457
no one could come in.

29:25.196 --> 29:27.187
Laura had us all fooled.

29:27.265 --> 29:29.927
Objection. Hearsay.
Sustained.

29:30.702 --> 29:33.034
The jury will disregard
the last remark.

29:33.104 --> 29:37.336
Mrs. Hodge, please confine
your testimony
to what you saw.

29:38.877 --> 29:42.973
Well, Mildred disappeared
into the apartment...

29:43.047 --> 29:44.776
with a bad cough...

29:45.049 --> 29:49.042
and next time I saw her,
she was dead.

29:50.588 --> 29:55.389
Did you have any reason
to believe that Mrs. Bauer
should have been isolated?

29:55.460 --> 29:57.860
Of course not.
She wasrt a child.

29:58.229 --> 30:00.527
(Stone)
And when was the last time
you heard from her?

30:00.598 --> 30:04.329
She sent me a note
a few weeks before she died.

30:04.702 --> 30:09.401
She wanted to know
if I could contribute to
the engagement gift for Laura.

30:09.641 --> 30:10.972
A tablecloth.

30:11.042 --> 30:14.375
Mildred said she was going
to give Laura some bonds...

30:14.445 --> 30:16.913
for her future
great-grandchildren.

30:16.981 --> 30:21.418
And that was to celebrate
the defendant's engagement
to Mr. Halliwell, correct?

30:21.486 --> 30:22.544
Yes.

30:22.854 --> 30:26.620
I gather
the engagement is off.
Thank you.

30:28.092 --> 30:29.923
No further questions.

30:32.764 --> 30:36.461
Mrs. Hodge, you had no way
of really knowing...

30:36.534 --> 30:38.934
how sick Mrs. Bauer was,
did you?

30:39.270 --> 30:42.330
All my friends are dying
fairly regularly now.

30:43.942 --> 30:46.638
Mildred didn't have
that look they get.

30:46.778 --> 30:49.770
Yes, but you didn't see her
for the last weeks
of her life, did you?

30:49.848 --> 30:51.008
They wouldn't let me.

30:51.082 --> 30:55.041
Yet you said you didn't see
any reason to keep the world
away from Mrs. Bauer.

30:55.119 --> 30:58.850
Now, for instance, did you
know that her grocer
was overcharging her?

30:58.923 --> 31:00.288
How could I know that?

31:00.358 --> 31:04.920
Did you know that a plumber
charged her $800 to fix pipes
that werert even broken?

31:04.996 --> 31:08.124
She didn't need to be
protected from me.
Really?

31:08.199 --> 31:12.135
Isn't it true that you
borrowed $300 from
Mildred Bauer over a year ago?

31:12.203 --> 31:14.831
Well, the Medicare didn't
cover some dental work.

31:14.906 --> 31:16.999
Well, she knew that
I'd pay her back.

31:17.075 --> 31:18.565
Did you?
I would have.

31:18.643 --> 31:20.838
Could that be why you were
kept from seeing her?

31:20.912 --> 31:23.574
Because you were one of
those people
who were taking advantage...

31:23.648 --> 31:25.639
of your so-called friend?

31:27.385 --> 31:29.751
She twisted everything.
Couldrt you stop her?

31:29.821 --> 31:31.584
Mrs. Hodge,
I asked you...

31:31.656 --> 31:34.216
if there was anything
in your relationship
with Mrs. Bauer...

31:34.292 --> 31:35.850
that they could
hold against you.

31:35.927 --> 31:38.953
Now, how could I tell
it mattered if I had
my teeth fixed?

31:39.030 --> 31:41.555
I also said that there are
rules in the courtroom...

31:41.633 --> 31:43.294
that do not apply
in the outside world.

31:43.368 --> 31:45.666
Well, don't patronize me,
young man.

31:45.737 --> 31:47.398
I'm trying not to
patronize you, ma'am.

31:47.472 --> 31:50.339
Politicians want our votes,
and everybody wants our money.

31:50.408 --> 31:53.172
Otherwise, they don't even see
you, unless you're walking
too slow...

31:53.244 --> 31:57.647
and then they push you aside.
If you're a burden,
now they can kill you.

32:01.953 --> 32:05.889
It's no problem. We have
the lying and thieving
illegal alien maid.

32:06.357 --> 32:08.018
I wouldn't
count on that.

32:08.092 --> 32:11.459
Her lawyer called. INS is
deporting her in six hours.

32:17.302 --> 32:20.100
It was understood that
my client wouldn't face
any charges.

32:20.171 --> 32:23.971
The burglary was dropped.
Well, thanks for nothing.
You had no case.

32:24.042 --> 32:25.475
And we talked
to lmmigration.

32:25.543 --> 32:28.011
Proceedings against
Miss Gonzales
will be suspended

32:28.079 --> 32:29.376
until after
Laura Bauer's trial.

32:29.447 --> 32:32.883
That won't do her any good.
Miss Gonzales has grown
fond of New York.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.009
God knows why.

32:34.085 --> 32:38.317
Charlie, you know
the jurisdiction was federal.
It's out of my hands.

32:39.057 --> 32:42.823
We will need assurances that
deportation proceedings
will be dropped.

32:42.894 --> 32:44.589
Or what?
Or Miss Gonzales...

32:44.662 --> 32:47.995
gets on that airplane tonight,
and you fly solo
in the courtroom tomorrow.

32:48.066 --> 32:51.968
Wrong. She testifies,
or she's jailed for contempt.

32:52.036 --> 32:55.233
She serves that sentence,
and then she's deported.

33:04.782 --> 33:06.079
<i>(Maria)</i>
<i>I told her...</i>

33:06.150 --> 33:08.209
you got to feed her
or she's gonna die.

33:08.286 --> 33:10.618
And how did Miss Bauer respond
when you said that?

33:10.688 --> 33:14.317
She said, "You want to work
here, do what I say."

33:15.059 --> 33:18.324
And did you do what she said?
I couldn't just do nothing.

33:18.730 --> 33:22.496
I gave her extra food.
That's when she fired me.

33:23.134 --> 33:26.968
So what happened
after she fired you?
I called Felix.

33:27.372 --> 33:31.274
He came to help me take
my things. We were going.

33:31.442 --> 33:35.276
That's when I remembered
I had Mrs. Bauer's medicine
in my bag.

33:35.346 --> 33:37.177
She wouldn't take it
that morning.

33:37.248 --> 33:40.411
So please tell the court
what happened next,
Miss Gonzales.

33:40.485 --> 33:44.581
I went back upstairs and told
Miss Bauer I had the medicine.

33:44.722 --> 33:46.189
She said, "Keep it."

33:46.290 --> 33:48.986
Her grandmother
didn't need it, anymore.

33:49.827 --> 33:51.761
Thank you. Your witness.

33:55.266 --> 33:59.066
Miss Gonzales,
you and your boyfriend,
Felix Ortega...

33:59.137 --> 34:02.470
broke into Mrs. Bauer's
apartment the day she died,
didn't you?

34:02.540 --> 34:05.441
We wanted to see
if she was all right.
Yeah.

34:05.510 --> 34:07.137
But she wasrt all right,
was she?

34:07.211 --> 34:08.838
She was lying on the floor,
dead...

34:08.913 --> 34:11.279
and you stepped over her
to steal her valuables.

34:11.349 --> 34:13.510
No. We ran away.

34:13.684 --> 34:16.016
You were arrested
for burglary, werert you?

34:16.087 --> 34:17.110
Yes.

34:17.188 --> 34:19.121
Mrs. Bauer's
silver candlesticks...

34:19.190 --> 34:21.750
were found in Mr. Ortega's
apartment, were they not?

34:21.958 --> 34:23.051
Yes.

34:23.127 --> 34:26.494
And yet, the District Attorney
chose to drop those charges,
didn't he?

34:26.563 --> 34:28.327
I didn't take anything.

34:28.399 --> 34:30.663
You were scheduled
to be deported yesterday,
werert you?

34:30.735 --> 34:33.898
Objection. Relevance.
It's relevant
if the District Attorney...

34:33.971 --> 34:37.304
used his power, for
the second time, Your Honor,
to influence the testimony...

34:37.375 --> 34:39.639
of this witness.
That is not true, Your Honor.

34:39.710 --> 34:40.972
Approach.

34:44.882 --> 34:48.648
The truth of any testimony
here will be decided
by the jury.

34:48.719 --> 34:51.779
If I'm slandered, Your Honor,
I have to reply.

34:53.391 --> 34:54.516
Miss Melnick...

34:54.592 --> 34:58.824
any more remarks
that provoke Mr. Stone
will also provoke me...

34:59.263 --> 35:02.061
and you will regret it.
Yes, Your Honor.

35:03.334 --> 35:06.030
Mr. Stone,
your objection is overruled.

35:09.974 --> 35:11.339
Miss Gonzales...

35:11.476 --> 35:14.707
you were scheduled
to be deported yesterday,
were you not?

35:14.779 --> 35:15.803
Yes.

35:15.880 --> 35:20.283
And the District Attorney
took action to prevent
that deportation, did he not?

35:20.351 --> 35:23.878
I don't know.
You don't know?
You're here, aren't you?

35:26.524 --> 35:27.650
Nothing further.

35:27.725 --> 35:31.286
Miss Gonzales, did I or anyone
in the District Attorney's
office...

35:31.362 --> 35:35.594
ever tell you to say
anything but the truth?
No. It is the truth.

35:35.733 --> 35:39.829
And in regard to
Miss Melnick's inference
about your deportation...

35:39.904 --> 35:42.099
what are your plans tomorrow?

35:42.840 --> 35:45.775
They are sending me back
to Santo Domingo.

35:47.912 --> 35:49.243
(Stone)
Thank you.

35:51.182 --> 35:55.778
Grans had some cousins
in New Jersey, too.
They never visited, either.

35:56.020 --> 35:59.979
So the care of your
grandmother fell entirely upon
your shoulders, didn't it?

36:00.057 --> 36:03.754
I didn't mind. She could be
kind of difficult...

36:03.828 --> 36:07.992
but she said we were
a lot alike, that crankiness
ran in the family.

36:09.066 --> 36:11.694
Laura, would you please
explain to the court...

36:11.769 --> 36:14.499
why you told your grandmother
that you were going
to law school?

36:14.572 --> 36:16.437
Because I am going to go.

36:16.507 --> 36:19.374
My grades just werert
good enough
to apply right now.

36:19.443 --> 36:21.911
I'm taking courses
to get my average up.

36:21.979 --> 36:25.847
When you gave Maria Gonzales
instructions about feeding
your grandmother...

36:25.917 --> 36:28.943
did you ever believe
that these instructions
would be harmful?

36:29.020 --> 36:31.818
Of course not. I was following
the doctor's orders.

36:31.889 --> 36:34.255
But she stopped seeing
that doctor, didn't she?

36:34.325 --> 36:37.658
My grandmother didn't like
him. She was very particular.

36:37.728 --> 36:42.324
I tried to get her to see
someone else, but she said
she was feeling better.

36:43.201 --> 36:45.465
I just tried to keep
her comfortable.

36:45.736 --> 36:49.103
Laura, when you stopped by
your grandmother's
apartment...

36:49.173 --> 36:53.803
the night before her body
was found, why didn't you
do anything to help her?

36:54.111 --> 36:57.706
She was in bed.
I thought she was sleeping.

36:59.383 --> 37:01.613
I thought
everything was fine.

37:03.487 --> 37:06.320
Thank you.
Your witness.

37:09.293 --> 37:12.922
I assume you have more
than a few questions,
Mr. Stone?

37:13.764 --> 37:15.356
Yes, Your Honor.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.795
We'll recess
until tomorrow morning.

37:18.970 --> 37:21.734
The loving grandchild
versus the undesirable alien.

37:21.806 --> 37:23.103
Now there's
an even match.

37:23.174 --> 37:25.369
Everything undermines
the maid's credibility.

37:25.443 --> 37:28.139
The boyfriend,
the burglary, the deportation.

37:28.212 --> 37:30.976
The INS doesn't deport people
who blow up Lower Manattan.

37:31.048 --> 37:34.609
Why did they suddenly
get interested
in a Dominican maid?

37:34.952 --> 37:36.476
Let's ask them.

37:38.422 --> 37:40.390
Her name was
on our watch list.

37:40.458 --> 37:43.916
We check it against
arrest records, there she was.

37:45.062 --> 37:47.155
And here we are.

37:47.865 --> 37:51.926
Why was her name on the list?
Was she some kind of
notorious maid?

37:52.603 --> 37:55.936
Anonymous telephone informant,
a couple of months ago.

37:56.007 --> 37:58.840
Gave us her name,
told us where she lived.

37:59.043 --> 38:01.944
Like we can spare people
to pick people up.

38:02.246 --> 38:05.511
We put her on the list.
Worked out fine.

38:06.183 --> 38:07.980
Somebody gave you
her address?

38:08.052 --> 38:11.351
Probably her boyfriend's
other girlfriend.
That's the usual.

38:13.190 --> 38:15.784
What was the date
on that phone call?

38:25.002 --> 38:27.562
I only wanted my grandmother
to be happy.

38:27.638 --> 38:31.904
So to make her happy,
you lied about going
to law school...

38:32.243 --> 38:35.212
and you lied about
investing in a restaurant...

38:35.279 --> 38:38.077
and you lied about
your engagement
to Mr. Halliwell, correct?

38:38.149 --> 38:40.242
It wasrt done to harm her.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.650
You see no harm
in lying to an old woman...

38:42.720 --> 38:45.382
in order to get her
to give you her apartment?

38:45.523 --> 38:49.289
She gave me that apartment
because she loved me,
and I loved her.

38:49.360 --> 38:51.692
And you didn't have
any resentments toward her...

38:51.762 --> 38:54.253
for demanding your time
and your attention?

38:54.565 --> 38:55.623
No, I didn't.

38:55.700 --> 39:00.034
And you didn't resent her for
wanting another kind
of granddaughter?

39:00.237 --> 39:04.196
One who could go to law school
and marry someone like
Kent Halliwell?

39:04.408 --> 39:06.774
She had high standards.
I respected that.

39:06.844 --> 39:10.211
And you didn't resent her
denying you an ineritance?

39:10.414 --> 39:14.043
One that you and your mother
thought was rightfully yours?

39:14.385 --> 39:16.114
I am not my mother.

39:16.654 --> 39:19.714
Well, you are either the most
patient person I ever met...

39:19.790 --> 39:22.486
or you're lying now
to make the jury happy.

39:22.560 --> 39:24.994
Objection, Your Honor.
Withdrawn.

39:25.663 --> 39:28.291
Miss Bauer, on the day
that your grandmother died...

39:28.366 --> 39:30.664
you told the police
that you did not know...

39:30.735 --> 39:33.295
where Maria Gonzales lived,
is that correct?

39:34.205 --> 39:35.229
Yes.

39:35.306 --> 39:39.037
Yet the same day, someone
called the lmmigration
and Naturalization Service...

39:39.110 --> 39:41.704
told them exactly
where Miss Gonzales lived...

39:41.779 --> 39:44.942
and suggested that she
be picked up and deported.

39:46.150 --> 39:49.745
Did you make that call?
Objection.
Where did this call come from?

39:49.820 --> 39:53.256
Your Honor, we would like
to introduce into evidence...

39:53.324 --> 39:56.521
the local usage details
on Miss Bauer's telephone.

39:59.530 --> 40:02.192
Yes, I called them.

40:03.033 --> 40:05.467
So you lied to the police,
as well.

40:05.569 --> 40:09.869
Why all the lies, Miss Bauer?
And why the call to the INS?

40:10.508 --> 40:13.136
Because Miss Gonzales
knew what you were up to...

40:13.210 --> 40:15.337
and you didn't want her
telling anybody?

40:15.413 --> 40:19.907
That's not it.
I was confused. I felt guilty.

40:19.984 --> 40:22.714
Of course you did,
because you killed
your grandmother.

40:22.787 --> 40:25.187
No, because I
couldn't save her!

40:30.361 --> 40:34.593
I knew she was dying. She
refused to go to a hospital.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.731
She said all of her friends
were dead...

40:37.802 --> 40:42.034
the pain was so bad she
couldn't sleep, and it wasrt
going to get any better.

40:44.275 --> 40:46.869
She told me that
she wanted to die.

40:48.612 --> 40:52.571
I begged her to eat.
I argued with her,
but she was so stubborn.

40:55.286 --> 40:59.450
I felt guilty because I
hadrt argued harder.

41:00.891 --> 41:03.985
When she asked me
why she should go on living...

41:04.528 --> 41:06.792
I couldn't give her
an answer.

41:18.309 --> 41:21.642
Mr. Stone, a priest
has been waiting
to see you since 8:00...

41:21.712 --> 41:23.839
so I put him
in your office.

41:25.149 --> 41:26.377
Thanks.

41:26.984 --> 41:29.418
Mildred Bauer
was my parishioner.

41:30.821 --> 41:34.484
When Laura was arrested,
the papers made it sound like
she was guilty.

41:34.558 --> 41:37.618
I didn't know what to think.
But now, I feel that l...

41:37.695 --> 41:40.528
Excuse me, Father,
I have to ask you this.

41:40.931 --> 41:43.422
Did her lawyer
call you?

41:44.034 --> 41:45.865
No. She doesn't know.

41:46.370 --> 41:49.271
I heard about Laura's
testimony on the news.

41:50.207 --> 41:54.439
I mean, I don't know
what I know for sure, really.

41:56.714 --> 41:59.274
Mildred came to see me
a few months ago.

41:59.350 --> 42:02.012
She was ill.
She was in pain.

42:02.553 --> 42:06.717
She said she didn't think
God would want her
suffering to continue.

42:08.025 --> 42:10.050
I knew where she was headed.

42:10.127 --> 42:13.358
Then she asked
if she let herself die...

42:14.064 --> 42:17.932
if she let God's course
manifest itself...

42:18.002 --> 42:20.197
would it be
the same as suicide?

42:20.271 --> 42:22.102
Now, I cautioned her:

42:23.908 --> 42:26.502
Despair is an insult to God.

42:26.877 --> 42:30.108
God doesn't want
her help to work his ways.

42:30.948 --> 42:34.748
And if she did what I thought
she wanted to do...

42:35.386 --> 42:38.822
I couldn't bury her.
But you did bury her.

42:39.490 --> 42:44.018
She didn't shoot herself.
She didn't take pills.
I didn't know anything.

42:45.162 --> 42:47.960
I had to give her
the benefit of a doubt.

42:50.134 --> 42:52.728
Miss Bauer,
it's pretty damn convenient.

42:52.803 --> 42:57.137
You suddenly remember that
your grandmother wanted
to commit suicide...

42:57.207 --> 43:01.371
after you're put on trial for
murder, and the case turns
against you.

43:01.512 --> 43:04.242
If you're not a Catholic,
it's hard to explain.

43:04.315 --> 43:06.875
I am a Catholic, Miss Bauer.
Try me.

43:07.318 --> 43:10.481
Then you know.
Suicide is a mortal sin.

43:11.388 --> 43:16.052
My grandmother wanted to be
buried in consecrated ground
next to her parents.

43:16.527 --> 43:19.655
I couldn't tell anyone.
Murder is a mortal sin, too.

43:19.730 --> 43:22.528
You just don't get it.
She wanted to die.

43:23.334 --> 43:27.566
Why do you think she never
called for help? There was
a phone next to her bed.

43:28.772 --> 43:31.605
It doesn't explain
why you called the INS.

43:31.809 --> 43:35.336
Maria is a Catholic, too.
What if she said something?

43:35.412 --> 43:39.041
What if I had to bury
my grandmother
in a public cemetery?

43:39.416 --> 43:41.907
You were willing to go
to prison
to keep this a secret?

43:41.986 --> 43:46.389
I never conceived of being
arrested, let alone convicted.

43:47.491 --> 43:48.958
I'm innocent.

43:49.994 --> 43:53.054
Danielle, how can I possibly
know this is true?

43:53.597 --> 43:55.861
Your client has a pretty good
record of lying.

43:55.933 --> 43:57.594
(Laura)
I had to lie.

43:58.035 --> 43:59.798
I can be forgiven for lying.

43:59.870 --> 44:03.306
Suicide is the only sin
that can't be forgiven.

44:07.578 --> 44:11.742
In all honesty, Adam,
I'm not sure of anything
involved in this case.

44:11.815 --> 44:13.840
It's the jury
that has to be sure.

44:13.917 --> 44:15.475
I talked to
the funeral home.

44:15.552 --> 44:19.352
Mildred Bauer called a month
before she died to make
arrangements for herself.

44:19.423 --> 44:20.822
There you are.

44:20.891 --> 44:23.325
Two years ago
I bought a cemetery plot.

44:23.394 --> 44:26.454
I wake up one morning,
I'm depressed, I skip lunch.

44:26.530 --> 44:28.828
You gonna lock me in my closet
and starve me?

44:28.899 --> 44:30.491
Adam, help me out here.

44:30.567 --> 44:34.298
If Mildred Bauer wanted
to die, this is not the case
we started out with.

44:34.371 --> 44:38.307
You don't know
what Mildred Bauer wanted,
nor did that girl.

44:38.375 --> 44:40.536
She should have taken her
grandmother to the hospital.

44:40.611 --> 44:44.069
To die hooked up
to a bunch of machines?
Or to live?

44:44.214 --> 44:47.672
I think we ought to offer her
a deal. Assisted suicide.

44:47.751 --> 44:50.549
If you believe the girl,
she's hardly guilty of that.

44:50.621 --> 44:54.182
That's my problem. I don't
know if she's not lying again.

44:54.725 --> 44:56.920
Melnick'll take the plea?
I think so.

44:56.994 --> 44:59.155
She knows we've got
a shot to convict.

44:59.229 --> 45:02.221
So the two of you
want to pressure the girl...

45:03.233 --> 45:06.669
to plead to a lesser offense
that she might not be
guilty of...

45:06.737 --> 45:10.002
because she's about to be
convicted of
a more serious crime...

45:10.074 --> 45:11.871
she might be guilty of.

45:11.942 --> 45:14.877
Does that make sense to you?
With our system...

45:14.945 --> 45:17.311
and imperfect knowledge, yes.

45:22.052 --> 45:24.577
How long would I
have to be in jail?

45:25.556 --> 45:26.887
Two years.

45:29.660 --> 45:32.458
I still don't think
I did anything wrong.

45:32.563 --> 45:35.862
They remove feeding tubes
in hospitals all the time.

45:36.366 --> 45:39.426
If you're convicted
of murder, you'll serve 25.

45:45.375 --> 45:47.809
It was so hard
to know what to do.

45:49.012 --> 45:52.209
Some days she was so clear
about what she wanted.

45:54.351 --> 45:55.875
Other times <i>...</i>

45:58.589 --> 45:59.988
Other times?

46:00.491 --> 46:02.686
We've accepted
the deal, Ben.

46:11.135 --> 46:13.626
That girl ought to send you
a thank-you note.

46:13.704 --> 46:15.763
She's going away
for two years, Adam.

46:15.839 --> 46:18.740
And when she gets out,
she'll be, what, 24?

46:18.809 --> 46:20.868
Twenty-five.
Twenty-five.

46:22.179 --> 46:25.808
I'd do two years in Attica
happily, if I walked out 25.
