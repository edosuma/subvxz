00:06.882 --> 00:11.053
I just love your writing, Tom,
ever since <i>Scorpio.</i>

00:11.136 --> 00:13.471
I think it just gets better and better.

00:13.556 --> 00:16.684
Oh, yeah?
What else have you read?

00:16.767 --> 00:21.396
All of them. I thought
the latest was brilliant, <i>God's Cauldron.</i>

00:21.479 --> 00:24.357
- You read that?
- In one sitting.

00:24.441 --> 00:28.070
But what we'd really love to read
is your book on the Underwoods.

00:28.153 --> 00:32.156
- Well, it's changed. It's fiction now.
- But based on them.

00:34.076 --> 00:35.703
People might draw parallels.

00:35.786 --> 00:37.830
Would the Underwoods find it flattering?

00:37.913 --> 00:39.790
I don't think they'd be too happy with it.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.000
How do you think it'll do?

00:43.251 --> 00:46.171
- Who knows?
- Better than <i>God's Cauldron,</i> I hope.

00:46.254 --> 00:49.007
Sales were disappointing, weren't they?

00:49.091 --> 00:50.342
In fact, they've been disappointing

00:50.425 --> 00:53.386
on everything you've written
the past ten years.

00:53.470 --> 00:56.306
We can change that with this new book.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.475
I'm not a political tool.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.894
We didn't fly you up here
because my wife's a fan.

01:00.978 --> 01:03.021
I'm sure you had a notion
of what we're after.

01:03.105 --> 01:04.982
I didn't have any expectations.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.525
I just came because I was curious.

01:07.610 --> 01:11.113
Well, then let me satisfy your curiosity.

01:11.196 --> 01:13.323
If your book can hurt the Underwoods,

01:13.907 --> 01:16.076
we want it to be published
before the election,

01:16.159 --> 01:18.411
and we want it to be big.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.831
Dana Treister, do you know her?

01:20.914 --> 01:22.332
The editor of <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

01:22.415 --> 01:26.712
- That's right. She's a close friend.
- And Ben Grant, founder of Pollyhop.

01:26.795 --> 01:27.963
I saw the webcast.

01:28.046 --> 01:30.048
They don't manipulate
search results,

01:30.132 --> 01:33.343
but let's just say
a big spread in <i>Vanity Fair...</i>

01:33.426 --> 01:34.970
Nice juicy excerpt,

01:35.053 --> 01:39.182
profile on Thomas Yates,
his literary comeback.

01:39.266 --> 01:43.395
We're on the cover this month, but...
next month it could be you.

01:43.478 --> 01:47.065
I'm on the Marxist side of Democrat.

01:47.149 --> 01:51.236
- Why would I help a Republican?
- You'd be helping yourself, Tom.

01:51.319 --> 01:53.321
And if that helps us
a little bit along the way,

01:53.405 --> 01:55.365
what's the harm in that?

01:57.000 --> 02:03.074

03:46.601 --> 03:48.896
Senator Dean Austen of Ohio,

03:48.979 --> 03:51.398
the leadership's top choice
for running mate.

03:51.481 --> 03:54.567
Twelve years in Congress,
helps us with a major swing state,

03:54.651 --> 03:56.737
middle of the road,
very few enemies,

03:56.820 --> 04:00.407
and most importantly to them,
long-time friend of the NRA.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.618
Now his shortcomings are
he's another middle-aged white guy,

04:03.701 --> 04:08.248
underwhelming, unimaginative
and a long-time friend of the NRA.

04:08.331 --> 04:11.084
So you can see how I feel
about the leadership's choice.

04:11.168 --> 04:12.169
Senator.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.421
I'm honored, Mr. President.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.882
I just have one major reservation.

04:17.966 --> 04:20.177
- Claire.
- Yes, sir.

04:20.803 --> 04:21.887
Well, between you and me,

04:21.970 --> 04:24.222
I'm not even sure
this gun bill is gonna pass.

04:24.306 --> 04:26.850
But if I'm being asked to support it,
you know the sort of hot water--

04:26.934 --> 04:31.229
Yes, but I need you on the ticket
to balance our stance on guns.

04:31.313 --> 04:33.523
We have to appeal
to the Republicans as well.

04:33.606 --> 04:36.359
And look, I'm not asking you
to get behind the bill,

04:36.443 --> 04:38.695
just not to publicly trash it.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.697
I know this is an important issue to you.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.074
It is important,

04:42.157 --> 04:46.619
but not as much as an experienced
leader who can deliver Ohio.

04:48.330 --> 04:50.290
Then consider me on board, sir.

04:52.584 --> 04:55.462
We're not sure we can get this
to the floor before the election.

04:55.545 --> 04:59.632
That's the deal we made.
You get Austen, we get the gun bill.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.844
We need a strong Senate version first,

05:01.927 --> 05:04.179
so we don't have two weak bills
going into reconciliation.

05:04.262 --> 05:08.183
You want Austen,
you will make this bill a reality.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.978
Or, we can revisit the choice
for running mate.

05:12.062 --> 05:14.522
No...
let us see what we can do.

05:14.606 --> 05:16.316
I'll call Mitchell.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.652
Gentlemen,

05:19.736 --> 05:21.488
the future vice president.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.031
- Congratulations, Dean.
- Thank you very much.

05:23.115 --> 05:25.367
- Welcome.
- Thank you. Mrs. Underwood.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.327
- Nice to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.996
So, how's it going in here?

05:29.079 --> 05:32.415
Well, I think we're in alignment.
Wouldn't you say?

05:33.834 --> 05:35.335
It's been a productive meeting.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.880
So, let's talk about
when we should announce.

05:38.588 --> 05:41.799
I, uh, I need to soften
the blow to the NRA

05:41.884 --> 05:44.677
- before we go public.
- It's imperative we keep a lid on this.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.972
No leaks until we're ready.

05:47.055 --> 05:49.641
Just the four of us in this room.

05:49.724 --> 05:51.018
And Claire, of course.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.103
Well, I need to go
do this quick interview.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.188
Um, let me know
how it goes with Mitchell.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.984
All right,
I'm sure you have some--

05:59.067 --> 06:02.445
Oh, leave that open.
It gets so stuffy in here.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.072
Let's discuss the timing.

06:04.156 --> 06:05.949
Was it you or the First Lady?

06:06.658 --> 06:09.619
- First Lady all the way.
- She thinks she can win me over?

06:09.702 --> 06:11.788
She knows you'll hit harder
than anyone else.

06:11.871 --> 06:14.791
If she's still standing by the end,
maybe the bill has sea legs.

06:15.708 --> 06:18.628
- Kate.
- Good morning, Mrs. Underwood.

06:18.711 --> 06:21.256
How about we talk
in the Roosevelt Room?

06:25.302 --> 06:29.264
Support in the House is already wavering.
The public's losing interest in guns.

06:29.347 --> 06:31.891
Don't you want to wait until we sit down?

06:31.975 --> 06:34.227
Your staff only scheduled an hour.
I want to make the most of it.

06:34.311 --> 06:36.438
Oh, it's being used.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.231
Let's find somewhere else.

06:43.486 --> 06:44.654
Kate?

06:46.698 --> 06:49.617
Well, historically, gun reform
comes and goes in waves,

06:49.701 --> 06:53.455
as you know, so I believe this time,
it can be truly different.

06:53.538 --> 06:56.583
All the data's filtered here,
within these walls.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.710
My analysts do a first pass,
but ultimately,

06:58.793 --> 07:00.920
I do the final round myself.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.797
Our biggest concern is security.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.842
Top-grade firewall, same as
you guys use at NSA headquarters.

07:05.925 --> 07:08.095
<i>What about internal security?</i>

07:08.971 --> 07:10.973
<i>I'm the only one with full access.</i>

07:11.056 --> 07:12.515
<i>So,
if you do find anything,</i>

07:12.599 --> 07:15.560
<i>how do you communicate that
to us in a secure way?</i>

07:15.643 --> 07:16.769
<i>In person.</i>

07:16.853 --> 07:19.731
<i>I'll come to Fort Meade myself,
or you come here.</i>

07:19.814 --> 07:21.524
<i>No hardware leaves the premises.</i>

07:22.525 --> 07:25.445
<i>Can you walk us through
how the filtering algorithms work?</i>

07:25.528 --> 07:28.281
<i>We'll take firearms, for instance.</i>

07:28.365 --> 07:30.783
<i>If we start with everyone
who legally owns a gun,</i>

07:30.867 --> 07:33.911
<i>track geo-location patterns
through their phones,</i>

07:33.996 --> 07:35.622
<i>we start to put together a portrait</i>

07:35.705 --> 07:39.292
<i>of where gun-owners
live, eat, shop, everything.</i>

07:39.960 --> 07:43.380
<i>From this, we predict
everyone who might want a firearm,</i>

07:43.463 --> 07:45.007
<i>but who isn't registered.</i>

07:45.090 --> 07:48.260
<i>They're likely to exhibit
the same behavior as people who are.</i>

07:49.261 --> 07:51.721
<i>You can use that for people
who are interested in Arabic,</i>

07:51.804 --> 07:54.599
<i>uh, wanna travel to the Middle East,</i>

07:54.682 --> 07:58.686
<i>who are disillusioned
with the U.S. government...</i>

08:03.441 --> 08:07.945
So the same techniques that we're using
for our international surveillance.

08:08.030 --> 08:11.116
Yes... but far more advanced.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.495
Okay, turn a little bit
towards me, Mrs. Conway.

08:15.578 --> 08:16.746
Right.

08:18.956 --> 08:20.583
Ooh!

08:21.376 --> 08:23.336
You look great, Hannah.

08:23.420 --> 08:26.048
- What about the candidate?
- Don't get me started, Will.

08:29.051 --> 08:31.386
- You're really photogenic.
- I know.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.515
Franny Wallace, senior year.

08:36.599 --> 08:39.894
- The all-Goldfish diet.
- Did you have these put here specially?

08:39.977 --> 08:42.063
We roll out the platinum carpet, darling.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.648
I wonder what Franny's up to now.

08:43.731 --> 08:46.359
Hmm, not the Editor of <i>Vanity Fair,</i>
I'll tell you that.

08:46.443 --> 08:48.445
Or about to be the First Lady.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.863
Come a long way, haven't we?

08:51.656 --> 08:55.035
Yeah, Will and I, um...
Will and I appreciate your doing this.

08:55.118 --> 08:58.746
It's not charity. This issue will sell
like crazy with you two on the front.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.873
Well, I feel like
I should return the favor.

09:00.957 --> 09:03.085
A night in the Lincoln Bedroom?

09:03.876 --> 09:05.170
A story.

09:17.849 --> 09:19.476
You have a copy for me?

09:22.145 --> 09:23.521
An excerpt.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.691
- I need the whole book.
- That's all you get.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.820
Conway got the same thing.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.368
- That was a mistake, Tom.
- They came to me.

09:36.451 --> 09:39.412
But they don't get to publish...
without my approval.

09:41.998 --> 09:43.375
So what do you want?

09:44.542 --> 09:46.002
- A meeting.
- For?

09:48.130 --> 09:50.548
You're just a messenger, Doug.

09:50.632 --> 09:52.342
You got your message.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.345
One week.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.557
Thanks for the coffee.

10:03.811 --> 10:05.480
Mrs. Underwood, welcome.

10:05.563 --> 10:07.107
Thank you so much
for recording this robocall.

10:07.190 --> 10:09.234
It'll go a long way
in getting this bill passed.

10:09.317 --> 10:12.654
Well, thank you for all
the extraordinary work you're doing.

10:12.737 --> 10:14.030
Uh, where would you like me?

10:14.114 --> 10:16.199
Uh, Sally will show you
where we set up for the recording.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.909
Right this way, Mrs. Underwood.

10:21.329 --> 10:22.622
LeAnn...

10:28.461 --> 10:29.629
What is that?

10:30.297 --> 10:34.384
Names, phone numbers, emails.
A quarter million fresh targets.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.262
A quarter million?
Where'd you get this?

10:37.345 --> 10:40.056
No return address.
It's 50 times the names that we have.

10:40.140 --> 10:43.268
- Is it legit?
- Looks like it. We made sample calls.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.189
Hello, this is Claire Underwood.

10:48.440 --> 10:53.861
I need to confess something...
something I'm not proud to confess.

10:53.945 --> 10:57.114
When I was sitting
beside my husband in the hospital...

10:58.283 --> 11:00.368
all I thought about was me.

11:01.869 --> 11:05.915
My fear.
My pain if I was to lose him.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.336
And it was selfish.

11:09.419 --> 11:11.504
I-- I wasn't thinking
about everyone else

11:11.588 --> 11:16.050
who had gone through that fear and pain,
who had to sit where I was sitting

11:16.133 --> 11:20.888
because a loved one was shot
by someone who shouldn't have a gun.

11:22.474 --> 11:26.143
I'm ashamed because
I've never done anything about it.

11:26.228 --> 11:30.106
I'm ashamed of how many lives
we could've saved.

11:31.107 --> 11:34.277
How many families
we could've kept from suffering.

11:36.363 --> 11:39.532
We should all be ashamed,
every one of us,

11:39.616 --> 11:42.369
because the blood
is on all of our hands,

11:42.452 --> 11:46.623
and doing nothing
is the same as pulling a trigger.

11:46.706 --> 11:50.126
We need to do something.

11:55.757 --> 11:58.885
And that means changing the law.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.355
<i>♪ I am who I am ♪</i>

12:10.438 --> 12:12.231
<i>♪ And what I am ♪</i>

12:12.315 --> 12:15.192
<i>♪ And I will be what I will be ♪</i>

12:16.235 --> 12:17.654
<i>♪ Okay ♪</i>

12:19.281 --> 12:23.034
<i>♪ Present tense, I am who I am ♪</i>

12:23.535 --> 12:27.705
<i>♪ Not was to be, but I am ♪</i>

12:29.040 --> 12:30.458
<i>♪ Can you imagine that? ♪</i>

12:45.014 --> 12:47.892
Senator Austen's office.

12:47.975 --> 12:51.270
- More than 500 since this afternoon.
- From our district?

12:51.354 --> 12:55.066
We have it light. I'm hearing that
other offices have gotten over a thousand.

12:55.149 --> 12:57.485
Senator Austen's office.
I will take a message.

13:01.113 --> 13:02.407
Francis.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.577
You really shouldn't.

13:06.703 --> 13:09.121
Oh, one won't kill me.

13:09.205 --> 13:10.915
Did you finish it?

13:15.795 --> 13:18.631
Yeah.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.634
One part really caught my eye.

13:25.347 --> 13:31.978
"A chasm opened up between them,
a hallway less than ten yards wide.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.440
But it might as well
have been a thousand miles.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.274
A well-appointed no man's land

13:37.359 --> 13:41.153
with a plush carpet and high ceiling
between two bedrooms.

13:42.321 --> 13:44.991
In it were two centuries of ghosts,

13:45.074 --> 13:48.119
all the Presidents
and First Ladies before them.

13:48.202 --> 13:52.081
But also the ghost... of their marriage.

13:52.164 --> 13:56.419
A thirty years' war
that left them both dead inside

13:56.503 --> 13:59.255
and this dead space between them."

14:02.842 --> 14:04.761
He's perceptive.

14:06.638 --> 14:08.097
Uncanny.

14:13.478 --> 14:16.523
Well, it's not who we are.
Not anymore.

14:17.857 --> 14:21.528
People will want to believe
it's true even if it's false.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.615
What do you think it is
he wants to accomplish?

14:29.118 --> 14:32.079
He came here one night,
after I'd asked you to resign.

14:33.456 --> 14:36.000
He said he was obsessed.

14:36.834 --> 14:39.128
Or maybe he wants back in.

14:47.845 --> 14:49.847
You felt something for him.

14:51.474 --> 14:53.059
Maybe for a moment.

14:56.813 --> 15:00.149
- Did you?
- No, I don't think so.

15:03.695 --> 15:05.237
I felt...

15:07.615 --> 15:09.909
I felt like he saw me.

15:13.287 --> 15:15.039
Me, too.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.815
Mr. Barnes.

15:40.898 --> 15:44.110
<i>I couldn't stop thinking,
since you called...</i>

15:44.611 --> 15:45.820
about Zoe.

15:47.697 --> 15:51.200
- I guess I want answers.
- That-- That's what I want, too.

15:52.368 --> 15:57.289
- <i>What is it you want to know?</i>
- Was there... a relationship?

15:57.957 --> 15:59.792
<i>With Underwood?</i>

16:01.919 --> 16:05.673
When she was 17,
just before she went off to school...

16:06.924 --> 16:08.926
<i>she found out I was having an affair.</i>

16:10.512 --> 16:12.889
<i>Sales rep, some drug company.</i>

16:13.765 --> 16:15.683
<i>- Blonde.
- You know.</i>

16:16.809 --> 16:19.521
This isn't, you know, on the record.

16:21.523 --> 16:24.984
No...
No, not if you don't want it to be.

16:30.114 --> 16:32.199
You said she found out.

16:32.283 --> 16:36.287
She gave me three days to tell her mother,
or she would...

16:41.208 --> 16:42.835
I'm sorry, I had a few drinks.

16:43.961 --> 16:47.298
- Did you tell her?
<i>- Yeah, I told her.</i>

16:47.381 --> 16:48.591
We split up.

16:50.467 --> 16:53.012
Zoe didn't talk to me much after that.

16:54.388 --> 16:56.223
<i>I don't know anything about Underwood.</i>

16:57.224 --> 17:00.477
I'm the last person
she would've told.

17:05.066 --> 17:09.361
I wish I would've...
made more of an effort...

17:11.196 --> 17:13.156
to reach out to her.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.951
<i>Are you driving, Mr. Barnes?</i>

17:16.327 --> 17:17.537
Yeah.

17:18.871 --> 17:22.374
- I'm almost home.
- You should pull over.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.544
<i>Did you find out anything?</i>

17:25.127 --> 17:27.338
<i>Anything you can tell me?</i>

17:27.421 --> 17:30.592
She didn't have a lot of friends
at the <i>Herald.</i>

17:31.593 --> 17:35.763
Um, from what I can gather,
she didn't have any close friends at all.

17:36.513 --> 17:39.183
<i>I spoke to some people
in her neighborhood...</i>

17:40.351 --> 17:42.604
<i>but nothing so far.</i>

17:44.230 --> 17:45.397
Will you?

17:46.566 --> 17:48.610
- If you...
- Yeah, of course, of course.

17:48.693 --> 17:51.320
If you think of anything...

17:51.403 --> 17:52.572
<i>Yeah.</i>

18:18.180 --> 18:19.932
Then what were you doing there?

18:20.016 --> 18:23.645
If I do a meeting at the White House,
I don't have to explain myself, Julia.

18:23.728 --> 18:25.271
This bill might pass.

18:25.855 --> 18:29.108
- I realize that.
- Are you helping them?

18:29.191 --> 18:30.693
Absolutely not.

18:38.075 --> 18:40.494
- Julia.
- Mrs. Underwood.

18:40.577 --> 18:43.497
Sorry, I'd shake your hand,
but I just got back from a run.

18:43.580 --> 18:46.458
Listen, I wanted to say, I know
our meeting last time didn't go very well,

18:46.542 --> 18:48.377
and that's on me.
It was rude, what I said,

18:48.460 --> 18:50.755
and I hope you'll accept my apology.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.464
Have a seat, please.

18:56.719 --> 18:58.930
You ever been
in the residence before?

18:59.013 --> 19:01.724
The personal touch
isn't going to bring me on board.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.810
Neither will a few thousand
calls to Congress.

19:03.893 --> 19:06.688
84,000 in less than 24 hours.

19:07.271 --> 19:09.148
But let's put that aside for a moment

19:09.231 --> 19:11.442
- and talk about your good friend.
- Who?

19:11.525 --> 19:14.946
- Senator Austen.
- He told me. Running mate.

19:15.029 --> 19:16.781
Oh, not just running mate.

19:16.864 --> 19:19.992
You said I wouldn't
have to support this bill.

19:20.076 --> 19:21.953
Yes, but a lot can change in a day, Dean.

19:22.036 --> 19:25.414
We had no idea
there'd be this sort of groundswell.

19:25.497 --> 19:28.876
Julia Melman was all over my ass
even for being in the same room as you.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.586
Did you tell her?

19:31.378 --> 19:33.380
- I had to.
- Christ, Dean...

19:33.464 --> 19:35.091
It was that, or make an enemy for life.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.051
She's upset,
but I think she'll come around,

19:37.134 --> 19:39.679
unless you make me endorse closing
the gun show and Internet loopholes.

19:39.762 --> 19:40.930
Then she'll go ballistic.

19:41.013 --> 19:44.016
Dean wouldn't do that.
We've poured millions into his campaigns.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.852
And now he doesn't need you anymore.

19:45.935 --> 19:49.105
Are you trying to intimidate me?
To get us to back down?

19:49.188 --> 19:50.815
No, I have an offer.

19:50.898 --> 19:55.319
Ohio's a tough state for Democrats.
Julia's been very good to me.

19:55.402 --> 20:00.574
Loyalty's important, I understand,
but your loyalty has to be with me now.

20:00.657 --> 20:02.284
I just can't do it.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.286
All right, then we'll cancel
the announcement.

20:04.370 --> 20:05.913
I'll find someone else
to be my running mate.

20:05.997 --> 20:08.665
No, I mean,
I... I just can't support this bill.

20:08.750 --> 20:11.794
Oh, but you see,
the two go hand in hand now.

20:12.294 --> 20:15.339
So, are you on the ticket or not?

20:15.422 --> 20:18.718
What if the gun bill passes in the House,
but not the Senate?

20:18.801 --> 20:20.511
In return for what?

20:21.345 --> 20:24.098
You convince the senator to pull out.

20:25.266 --> 20:28.227
Now, the leadership wants him,
and we've played nice,

20:28.310 --> 20:32.314
but the president and I want Cathy Durant.
She's a much stronger candidate.

20:32.398 --> 20:34.608
You're willing to abandon your own bill?

20:34.691 --> 20:37.319
If it's means beating Conway
or beating you,

20:37.403 --> 20:38.695
that's not a hard choice.

20:40.281 --> 20:43.075
I already told Dean that I could
live with him being running mate.

20:43.159 --> 20:44.326
How do I backtrack?

20:44.994 --> 20:46.662
Just watch the news tomorrow.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.330
You made the right choice.

20:48.414 --> 20:50.249
- I hope so.
- Well, don't hope so, know so.

20:50.332 --> 20:53.920
And I'll have Seth
send you a copy of the speech.

20:55.337 --> 20:57.173
You can show the senator out now,
thank you.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.549
Yes, sir.

22:08.995 --> 22:11.873
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's okay. Come in.

22:16.460 --> 22:20.089
- What did he say?
- He'll do it. What did she say?

22:20.172 --> 22:22.174
That she'll think about it.

22:22.258 --> 22:24.676
How do we know
she won't tell him our plans?

22:24.760 --> 22:25.970
I told her if she does,

22:26.053 --> 22:28.014
we'll make sure
the bill goes through the Senate.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.682
Can you hand me a towel, please?

22:52.163 --> 22:55.291
- Meechum's hand.
- What?

22:58.335 --> 23:02.839
I traced it on a wall downstairs...
a while back.

23:03.840 --> 23:06.677
They've painted over it.
Oh, never mind.

23:06.760 --> 23:09.388
Francis, I've been thinking about Yates.

23:11.057 --> 23:12.558
The Conways have everything.

23:12.641 --> 23:16.270
They have their children,
their videos, their Twitter.

23:17.688 --> 23:20.441
There are very few people
who understand us.

23:20.524 --> 23:22.693
Meechum... was one.

23:24.653 --> 23:26.030
Tom is another.

23:41.462 --> 23:42.964
Eight...

23:46.925 --> 23:48.970
Seven. Nice.

24:01.648 --> 24:03.692
Mr. Long Pants.

24:10.032 --> 24:13.827
Mr. Nice Shoes.
Go! Go, go, go.

24:13.910 --> 24:15.371
- Go!
- Are you hungry?

24:15.871 --> 24:18.957
No money. You need to go.
You and your money, go.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.628
- I'm calling the cops.
- All right, all right.

24:22.711 --> 24:24.046
- The cops, right now...
- All right, all right.

24:24.130 --> 24:26.090
- I'm calling the cops.
- All right, all right.

24:30.761 --> 24:31.970
Ma'am...

24:35.141 --> 24:36.267
I'm Officer Tom.

24:40.646 --> 24:42.439
You called for me?

24:44.775 --> 24:46.568
There was a man here.

24:47.569 --> 24:50.989
A very bad man.

24:51.073 --> 24:54.285
- Do you live on this block?
- Thirty-three years.

24:55.952 --> 24:58.747
Three... three.

24:58.830 --> 25:01.500
Did you ever see this bad man
on your block?

25:02.793 --> 25:05.337
Did you ever see
this bad man on your block?

25:08.965 --> 25:10.801
All right.

25:10.884 --> 25:14.305
What about this woman?
Did you ever see her?

25:15.722 --> 25:17.891
- Pretty.
- Yes, yes, she is.

25:18.975 --> 25:20.227
Whore!

25:22.271 --> 25:24.315
- Go away!
- Why'd you say that?

25:24.398 --> 25:26.442
- Go away. Go away.
- Why'd you say that? Tell me.

25:26.525 --> 25:29.153
Tell Officer Tom.
Why did you call her that word?

25:29.236 --> 25:31.197
Go away!

25:35.117 --> 25:37.994
Built this myself,
with my son.

25:38.079 --> 25:40.331
He's doing El Capitan next spring.

25:41.248 --> 25:42.249
Free-climb.

25:43.167 --> 25:44.835
I feel like running for president

25:44.918 --> 25:47.629
is like climbing a cliff
without a safety rope.

25:48.714 --> 25:51.049
How is it the press don't know
you're here, by the way?

25:51.133 --> 25:52.134
Just like you, General,

25:52.218 --> 25:55.262
I take Sundays off
to spend time with family and friends.

25:55.346 --> 25:57.223
Or to make new friends.

25:57.889 --> 26:01.102
Look, Governor,
I know you still want me to resign.

26:01.185 --> 26:03.104
But I was wrong to threaten that.

26:03.187 --> 26:06.357
Dreyer told me ICO took over
another oil field this week.

26:07.899 --> 26:09.025
They're growing.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.195
Dreyer shares a lot with you, doesn't he?

26:11.278 --> 26:13.655
This is happening on your watch, General.

26:15.824 --> 26:18.994
The president isn't acting
and you can't force him to.

26:20.204 --> 26:22.498
Not if you stay.

26:23.540 --> 26:27.503
If you resign, though,
I promise it'll only be temporary.

26:28.712 --> 26:32.424
Once I get political,
I can't cross back over the line.

26:32.508 --> 26:34.426
I don't mean a recommission.

26:36.137 --> 26:39.306
I mean making you my running mate.

26:41.808 --> 26:43.310
Thank you.

26:43.894 --> 26:47.481
- Have you read it?
- Just an excerpt. It's powerful.

26:47.564 --> 26:51.067
And it'll be controversial.
Say yes and I'll show you.

26:51.152 --> 26:52.653
The <i>Telegraph</i> would never let me.

26:52.736 --> 26:55.864
- Same parent company, both our titles.
- Doesn't matter.

26:55.947 --> 26:57.366
Paper is strict
when it comes to moonlighting.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.910
It does matter,
because my dad is on the board.

26:59.993 --> 27:01.703
One call to your editor...

27:01.787 --> 27:05.207
There... there are plenty
of people who would jump at doing this.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.209
Not who know him intimately.

27:08.126 --> 27:09.378
My new election correspondent,

27:09.461 --> 27:12.214
he saw you and Yates
sneaking off on the campaign trail.

27:12.298 --> 27:15.717
Yates will open up to you.
I'm sure you know what buttons to push.

27:16.302 --> 27:17.844
It's a conflict of interest.

27:20.096 --> 27:22.057
My dad showed me that article you wrote.

27:22.974 --> 27:26.353
The one that never went to print
where you called him a tyrant.

27:27.062 --> 27:29.440
Some of us have
built our careers on our reputations,

27:29.523 --> 27:31.900
not by having their daddies
give them a magazine to play with.

27:31.983 --> 27:34.611
Or by cozying up
to old school chums, right?

27:35.362 --> 27:37.072
I've heard it all before.

27:37.823 --> 27:41.327
You may not like me,
you may not like the Conways,

27:41.410 --> 27:43.412
but I have to believe
you can stomach us better

27:43.495 --> 27:45.872
than another four years
of President Underwood.

27:48.875 --> 27:51.503
- Well, the writing is good.
- I know.

27:53.214 --> 27:54.923
Not good enough
to strong-arm a president.

27:55.006 --> 27:58.552
Well, good enough
to get me in this room.

27:59.470 --> 28:01.347
I thought Francis
made it very clear to you,

28:01.430 --> 28:03.474
you were not to challenge us.

28:03.557 --> 28:07.102
Yeah. He said he would tell the world
I didn't write <i>Scorpio.</i>

28:08.312 --> 28:09.605
I hope you understand

28:09.688 --> 28:13.275
that we can't allow you
to print this before the election.

28:13.359 --> 28:14.485
I do.

28:16.653 --> 28:18.196
Then why did you want to meet?

28:20.699 --> 28:22.117
I need an ending.

28:23.660 --> 28:27.248
I have one I can live with,
but not the one I love.

28:27.331 --> 28:30.626
- Because it's false.
- Well, it's true that you left.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.587
If I left, I wouldn't be here.

28:33.670 --> 28:35.088
I don't believe for a second

28:35.171 --> 28:38.091
you went to visit your mother
because she was sick.

28:38.174 --> 28:39.175
And why is that?

28:39.260 --> 28:41.177
Because you never mentioned her
one time to me.

28:43.264 --> 28:46.225
Saying nothing
says a lot sometimes.

28:47.976 --> 28:49.811
Well, what if the story
isn't about how she left,

28:49.895 --> 28:52.231
but how she came back.

28:53.482 --> 28:57.110
Just because you're here
doesn't mean you're here.

28:58.028 --> 28:59.696
Well, wouldn't you like to know?

29:02.991 --> 29:04.576
Don't you want your ending?

29:07.621 --> 29:09.248
Are you gonna tell me about it?

29:10.291 --> 29:13.252
About the two of you?
No lies.

29:13.335 --> 29:15.712
No, I'm not going to tell you anything.

29:16.713 --> 29:18.924
You can observe, like you did before.

29:20.091 --> 29:23.219
The difference is everything
you see this time will be yours.

29:24.179 --> 29:26.056
And in return,
we would like something.

29:26.139 --> 29:30.436
Speeches.
We need someone who knows us...

29:30.519 --> 29:32.062
and knows our voices.

29:33.647 --> 29:35.482
A speechwriter?
You're kidding.

29:35.566 --> 29:38.694
It's the only way to justify
you being with us...

29:38.777 --> 29:40.279
in case the press ask.

29:40.362 --> 29:43.407
Oh. You want to keep an eye on me.

29:44.074 --> 29:46.493
Well, I think that's fair.
Don't you?

29:47.118 --> 29:49.162
If you're keeping an eye on us?

29:51.039 --> 29:54.710
So you gave us a week.
We'll give you a day.

29:59.881 --> 30:00.882
Hmm.

30:00.966 --> 30:05.554
It was right here,
on this very spot,

30:05.637 --> 30:10.642
that I was shot with two bullets
from an illegally obtained handgun.

30:12.102 --> 30:17.774
Secret Service Agent Edward Meechum,
a marine and my friend,

30:17.858 --> 30:22.363
was slain with the bullets
from that very same gun.

30:23.989 --> 30:26.157
The public support...

30:26.241 --> 30:31.538
for the First Lady's...
Universal Background Check bill

30:31.622 --> 30:35.334
has been deafening
in these last few days.

30:35.417 --> 30:39.087
We have heard from
thousands and thousands of voices,

30:39.170 --> 30:44.885
and today, we would like to add
one more voice to that chorus.

30:44.968 --> 30:49.390
And it is a powerful voice.
Senator Dean Austen of Ohio.

30:53.727 --> 30:55.061
Thank you, Mr. President.

30:57.105 --> 31:00.191
I've been a member of the NRA
since I was a teenager.

31:00.275 --> 31:03.319
I've always been
a fierce advocate for gun rights.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.697
But today I want to offer
my strong support

31:05.781 --> 31:08.033
for the First Lady's bill.

31:09.410 --> 31:11.453
Here you go.

31:11.537 --> 31:14.998
- Let me ask you another question.
- I'm tellin' you, man,

31:15.081 --> 31:16.625
if you say she lived on the block,
I believe you.

31:16.708 --> 31:17.793
But she must not have liked pizza,

31:17.876 --> 31:19.461
'cause I don't remember
ever seein' her face.

31:19.545 --> 31:21.588
Not her.
President Underwood.

31:21.672 --> 31:23.799
Oh, Christ,
I can't get away from this guy.

31:23.882 --> 31:27.511
His wife just called me.
Robocall about guns.

31:27.594 --> 31:29.513
You ever seen him
around this neighborhood?

31:29.596 --> 31:30.806
Oh, yeah.
All the time.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.517
With the Queen of England,
Friday nights, after bowling.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.185
When he was in Congress.

31:35.977 --> 31:37.604
Nah, never once.

31:37.688 --> 31:39.355
I would've remembered.
I'm good with faces.

31:41.775 --> 31:43.234
- Parmesan?
- Over there.

31:51.493 --> 31:53.454
I saw this guy a few times, though.

31:54.663 --> 31:56.498
- The senator?
- No, the, uh, the dead guy.

31:56.582 --> 31:58.041
The Secret Service guy.

32:08.510 --> 32:10.345
In here?

32:10.429 --> 32:13.098
Yeah, a while back.
He used to stop in for coffee.

32:13.181 --> 32:15.141
Never any pizza, just coffee.

32:18.269 --> 32:22.398
- You're positive?
- Yeah. I told you, I'm good with faces.

32:28.614 --> 32:34.661
<i>"The wheels lifted,
and within seconds, Washington fell away,</i>

32:34.745 --> 32:39.415
<i>disappearing under
a blanket of haze and smog.</i>

32:39.500 --> 32:41.752
<i>Forehead pressed to the window,</i>

32:41.835 --> 32:45.464
<i>she imagined this was exactly
how it must have looked</i>

32:45.547 --> 32:48.675
<i>a thousand years ago,
when the sun rose above the clouds</i>

32:48.759 --> 32:51.928
<i>and there was nothing
but a swamp beneath.</i>

32:52.012 --> 32:56.099
<i>From this height, with this view,
she could be anywhere.</i>

32:56.182 --> 33:00.812
<i>But the important thing is
she was anywhere but there."</i>

33:02.063 --> 33:04.525
- You want another?
- Yeah.

33:29.132 --> 33:30.842
Did he say why?

33:32.969 --> 33:34.680
Okay, thanks, Dana.

33:35.639 --> 33:36.890
Yates pulled out.

33:36.973 --> 33:39.017
Said he came to an agreement
with the Underwoods.

33:39.100 --> 33:40.936
He was playing us off each other.

33:41.937 --> 33:43.647
We could still leak the excerpt.

33:46.441 --> 33:49.277
It's too risky.
If we get away with it, great.

33:49.360 --> 33:53.782
If we don't, we look like opportunists
fucking over an acclaimed novelist.

33:53.865 --> 33:54.991
It's not worth it.

33:55.075 --> 33:58.369
Do you think it's true,
that chasm between them?

33:59.287 --> 34:00.330
Who knows?

34:00.413 --> 34:03.709
I love that writing.

34:03.792 --> 34:07.671
- I wish I could've read the rest of it.
- I hated <i>Scorpio.</i>

34:08.880 --> 34:11.717
- It was beautiful.
- It's garbage.

34:11.800 --> 34:14.344
- Why?
- The main character's a pussy.

34:14.928 --> 34:18.306
- Will, you know I hate that word.
- He is.

34:18.389 --> 34:21.184
He lets his best friend kill himself.
He does nothing?

34:21.266 --> 34:23.895
He was in pain.
He was going to die anyway.

34:23.978 --> 34:25.938
It doesn't matter.
It's cowardly.

34:26.022 --> 34:28.399
I think he was brave.
And his friend.

34:28.483 --> 34:30.318
And I think Yates
was brave to write it.

34:30.400 --> 34:34.030
Brave is never giving up.
You fight, no matter what.

34:39.828 --> 34:42.330
So, Kate Baldwin was willing
if Yates was in?

34:42.413 --> 34:44.666
Yeah, Dana was giving her
20,000 words.

34:45.792 --> 34:46.960
I think we can pivot.

34:47.918 --> 34:48.920
How?

34:49.588 --> 34:51.172
Get her back on the phone.

34:55.551 --> 34:59.681
- Julia.
- Olivia, I didn't know you were in town.

34:59.765 --> 35:01.057
Oh, just a little visit.

35:01.141 --> 35:03.769
I miss seeing Dean's face sometimes.
Don't tell him that.

35:03.852 --> 35:05.937
- Will you give us a few minutes?
- No, she should stay.

35:06.021 --> 35:07.355
Oh, I know
you have things to discuss.

35:07.438 --> 35:09.274
Like your husband
withdrawing from the ticket.

35:10.901 --> 35:13.403
That's why she's in town, right?
For the announcement.

35:13.486 --> 35:15.781
I know the press conference
must've caught you off guard,

35:15.864 --> 35:17.282
but the president
didn't want you to know.

35:17.365 --> 35:20.368
- He thought you'd organize a protest.
- He was right. I would've.

35:20.451 --> 35:23.329
My plan was to sit down,
talk this out before the announcement.

35:23.413 --> 35:24.956
There isn't gonna be
an announcement.

35:25.749 --> 35:27.834
You... you can't waltz in here--

35:27.918 --> 35:31.379
We've raised $20 million for your husband
since he was a freshman.

35:31.462 --> 35:34.007
That gives me the right
to waltz in whenever I want.

35:34.090 --> 35:36.301
- Show some respect.
- Honey, please.

35:36.384 --> 35:39.262
No. This is what we wanted.

35:40.180 --> 35:42.432
- What we've worked for.
- When Underwood loses,

35:42.515 --> 35:45.476
you'll spend the next two years
fighting off a primary opponent.

35:45.560 --> 35:49.064
Every one of our 200,000 members in Ohio
will turn on you.

35:49.147 --> 35:53.068
By the time you've lost this office,
Olivia's law firm will go tits up.

35:53.151 --> 35:56.446
Don't forget, we pushed
most of your clients your way.

35:58.907 --> 36:01.367
He got cold feet.
What can I do?

36:01.451 --> 36:03.161
Convince him
to change his mind.

36:03.244 --> 36:05.831
He wouldn't listen.
He says the NRA came down hard on him.

36:05.914 --> 36:07.582
Because you had him
do the press conference.

36:07.666 --> 36:11.086
No, that was Austen's idea, not mine.
I told him to lay low,

36:11.169 --> 36:13.171
but he said if he was in,
he wanted to be all in.

36:13.254 --> 36:18.134
- The idea was to balance the ticket.
- Well, we can't do anything about Austen.

36:18.218 --> 36:20.511
The question now is
who do we get to replace him?

36:20.595 --> 36:22.180
Go back to the list?

36:22.263 --> 36:25.016
He was fine, but I'm not enthused
by anyone else on that list.

36:25.100 --> 36:27.518
Let's not go back to square one,
Mr. President.

36:27.602 --> 36:29.145
We have a good list.

36:29.229 --> 36:30.646
Everybody can get
behind those names.

36:30.731 --> 36:32.190
It's common sense.

36:33.233 --> 36:37.612
The only problem with common sense
is that it's so... common.

36:38.529 --> 36:40.866
I think we can do better.

36:40.949 --> 36:42.200
Who?

36:44.119 --> 36:45.245
Cathy Durant.

36:45.328 --> 36:48.581
Now, Louisiana's not a swing state,
I know that.

36:48.664 --> 36:52.502
But she is still a national figure,
she helps us with the women's vote,

36:52.585 --> 36:54.796
and I trust her.

36:55.922 --> 36:57.257
What about guns?

36:57.340 --> 36:58.884
I don't think she's ever had
a strong position.

36:58.967 --> 37:01.386
It's better than that.
She's never uttered a word on the issue.

37:01.469 --> 37:02.804
We checked.

37:07.768 --> 37:09.644
- I like it.
- So do I.

37:10.603 --> 37:13.064
- But I had another thought.
- Who?

37:13.148 --> 37:14.649
Not "who." How.

37:15.566 --> 37:20.446
I don't think I should choose her.
I think the party should choose her.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.742
Not an open convention.

37:23.825 --> 37:26.077
Look, Bob, let's...

37:27.996 --> 37:33.209
We have to face the fact that my health
is gonna be a major liability for us.

37:33.293 --> 37:38.214
No matter who becomes the running mate,
they could well end up being president.

37:38.298 --> 37:40.425
Now, that is a...

37:40.508 --> 37:42.593
a scenario
that I don't even like to fathom,

37:42.677 --> 37:43.970
but we can't escape it.

37:44.054 --> 37:49.100
And if it's such an important decision,
why not let the party make it?

37:49.768 --> 37:51.061
Because it'd be a free-for-all.

37:51.144 --> 37:53.563
No, no.
We make it so that Cathy wins.

37:53.646 --> 37:55.774
We'll just make it look
like the party chose her.

37:55.857 --> 37:59.194
And think of the coverage.
We'll own the news.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.321
You want the convention to be a circus.

38:01.404 --> 38:03.949
Oh, Bob, I'm not sure
if you've noticed or not,

38:04.032 --> 38:07.702
but politics is no longer just theater,
it's show business.

38:07.786 --> 38:10.330
So let's put on the best show in town.

38:11.164 --> 38:12.457
Great.

38:12.540 --> 38:14.167
Will you give me a salute, General?

38:19.297 --> 38:21.716
Active military aren't allowed
to speak to the press.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.302
He delivered his resignation this morning.

38:24.385 --> 38:25.678
No shit.

38:25.761 --> 38:28.890
We're gonna break it online
as soon as the president accepts it.

38:29.599 --> 38:32.310
Not often a monthly
gets raw meat like this, huh?

38:32.393 --> 38:35.771
- His phone's gonna blow up.
- But you get the exclusive.

38:37.732 --> 38:40.735
- Sorry about Tom.
- I'm not.

38:42.112 --> 38:43.738
Thank you, General.

38:43.822 --> 38:46.032
All right, we're gonna go set up
for the...

38:48.618 --> 38:51.079
Good afternoon, General.
Kate Baldwin.

38:52.372 --> 38:53.706
Shall we?

38:54.624 --> 38:58.962
So, the main issue that Mrs. Underwood
has been focusing on is guns, obviously.

38:59.045 --> 39:00.839
We've got some talking points
we've been using,

39:00.922 --> 39:03.091
- so you'll want to--
- I'm sorry, is there any water?

39:03.925 --> 39:05.260
Yes.

39:08.596 --> 39:10.098
I'm a bit hungover.

39:13.434 --> 39:15.436
At least I'm not still drunk.

39:17.188 --> 39:18.356
Want some?

39:19.024 --> 39:20.566
Uh, we're fine.

39:20.650 --> 39:22.027
Right.

39:23.569 --> 39:25.488
So...

39:25.571 --> 39:27.073
to the talking points.

39:28.741 --> 39:30.994
What is it?

39:40.336 --> 39:42.838
Excuse me for a moment, gentlemen.

39:46.092 --> 39:50.013
What I want to communicate mostly
is about the death toll,

39:50.096 --> 39:53.099
with personal stories,
things that connect with--

39:53.183 --> 39:54.517
Claire.

39:55.143 --> 39:58.354
- Tom.
- Mr. President.

39:58.897 --> 40:00.356
Can we speak?

40:01.691 --> 40:03.484
I'll, uh...
I'll leave you to it.

40:11.242 --> 40:13.786
Does she actually give a shit about guns?

40:13.869 --> 40:16.414
What's that got to do with anything?

40:25.215 --> 40:26.925
We knew this was a possibility.

40:27.008 --> 40:30.386
He's gonna make a lot of noise.
It's Conway, I'm sure of it.

40:30.470 --> 40:34.099
Problem isn't Conway, it's LeAnn.
She pressured us to cancel the air strike.

40:34.182 --> 40:36.434
We chose our path, Doug.
Let's not second-guess it.

40:36.517 --> 40:39.020
No offense, Mrs. Underwood,
but she's doing damage.

40:39.104 --> 40:40.313
I think we should replace her.

40:40.396 --> 40:42.482
She's the reason
we're gonna pass the gun bill.

40:42.565 --> 40:46.319
Sir? I just got this from Dana Treister,
the editor of <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

40:46.402 --> 40:47.695
Not sure what it means...

40:50.823 --> 40:53.451
He's gonna make
that son of a bitch his running mate.

40:53.534 --> 40:55.954
- What's goin' on?
- I'll see what I can dig up on him.

40:56.037 --> 40:58.623
No. He was fully vetted when he was
commissioned for the Joint Chiefs.

40:58.706 --> 41:01.709
No, you go with Seth
and draft a statement on the resignation.

41:01.792 --> 41:05.296
- Yes, sir. Let's go.
- What's going on, Doug?

41:11.177 --> 41:13.263
And it's LeAnn's fault.

41:13.346 --> 41:15.931
He never would've resigned
if it wasn't for her.

41:16.016 --> 41:18.809
See what you can find.

41:18.893 --> 41:20.520
On the general?
The president said we shouldn't.

41:20.603 --> 41:22.022
On LeAnn.

41:22.105 --> 41:24.149
Hey, I don't wanna get involved
in some cage match--

41:24.232 --> 41:28.486
I thought we had an understanding.
Your obedience.

41:30.071 --> 41:32.032
I'll see what I can do.

41:35.535 --> 41:38.621
Do you agree with Doug?
You're having reservations about LeAnn?

41:38.704 --> 41:40.999
Less about her and more about Tom.

41:41.082 --> 41:44.877
But I told you I trust you on this,
so I'm trusting you.

41:46.796 --> 41:50.216
- Has the leadership agreed yet?
- They're skeptical.

41:50.966 --> 41:52.552
We can use this.

41:53.428 --> 41:56.764
Well, gentlemen, if there was any doubt
about an open convention, let it go,

41:56.847 --> 41:59.142
because we're gonna wanna bury this news.

41:59.225 --> 42:01.227
Brockhart has just resigned.

42:01.311 --> 42:04.522
And the general is about to appear
on the cover of <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

42:04.605 --> 42:06.482
Imagine what Conway can do with that.

42:06.566 --> 42:09.152
<i>Conway! Conway! Conway!</i>

42:12.113 --> 42:14.490
Thank you for coming.

42:14.574 --> 42:17.452
Thank you for coming.
Thank you! Thank you!

42:17.535 --> 42:19.037
Thank you for coming out.

42:19.120 --> 42:21.122
- Dana just sent me this.
- So great to see you.

42:21.206 --> 42:22.873
The story broke.

42:23.958 --> 42:25.626
- Hello.
- Isn't my wife perfect?

42:25.710 --> 42:28.338
Thank you.

42:28.421 --> 42:30.298
Let her know how perfect you think she is!

42:30.381 --> 42:33.134
Stop it. Ahh!

42:34.302 --> 42:36.679
You're too much!

42:36.762 --> 42:40.266
- Thank you! Thank you!
- Conway! Conway! Conway!

43:02.163 --> 43:04.082
Yeah, I know, Fausto.

43:05.250 --> 43:07.377
I get exhausted
