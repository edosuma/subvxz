01:18.560 --> 01:21.472
Hey, I'm already taken, love.

01:21.720 --> 01:23.711
- Who got it?
- Muriel.

01:25.720 --> 01:27.870
Looks like I'm next.

01:29.280 --> 01:33.159
Cheryl. Cheryl!
I can throw it again.

01:33.280 --> 01:36.556
You can't do that.
It went to her.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.750
Muriel, throw it again.

01:38.880 --> 01:42.316
What's the use of you having it, Muriel?
No one's ever gonna marry you.

01:42.440 --> 01:45.159
You've never even had a boyfriend.

01:45.280 --> 01:48.477
Cheryl's been going with Shane
for over six weeks. She's next.

01:48.600 --> 01:51.353
Muriel, don't be selfish.

01:55.080 --> 01:58.550
Sugar baby love

01:58.680 --> 02:02.753
Sugar baby love

02:02.880 --> 02:05.952
Keep your stupid bouquet!

02:06.080 --> 02:09.436
Shane and I broke up last night!

02:09.560 --> 02:12.028
Cheryl! Cheryl!

02:12.160 --> 02:15.038
Now look what you've done.
You didn't even buy a new dress.

02:15.160 --> 02:18.232
- Yes, I did.
- Cheryl!

02:18.360 --> 02:22.353
Chook, I won't be a minute.
Cheryl's upset. Cheryl!

02:22.480 --> 02:26.155
- Leave me alone!
- Yes, all lovers make

02:26.280 --> 02:29.477
Make the same mistakes

02:29.600 --> 02:32.717
As me and you

02:41.560 --> 02:43.790
There you are. Now if you
put this under your pillow,

02:43.920 --> 02:45.751
you'II dream of your future husband.

02:48.840 --> 02:52.116
- That's what they say.
- We always meet at Mary Tate's.

02:59.760 --> 03:03.469
G'day, Muriel.
That's an eye-catchin' dress.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.830
You got a minute?

03:05.960 --> 03:09.157
How's your dad?
Give him my card.

03:09.280 --> 03:12.875
I want you to tell him that
Leo Higgins reckons he's a great man...

03:13.000 --> 03:15.150
the best council president
this town's ever had.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.555
- Will you do that for me?
- What happened to your nose?

03:17.680 --> 03:19.352
- What?
- Nothing.

03:19.480 --> 03:21.550
Sunburnt, that's all.

03:45.560 --> 03:47.551
Oh, my God.

03:48.760 --> 03:51.877
But we're friends. What?

03:52.000 --> 03:53.956
- I love you.
- Yeah, but you love Tania too.

04:00.080 --> 04:02.833
- Chook.
- What?

04:02.960 --> 04:05.474
Shut the door!

04:20.480 --> 04:23.870
Excuse me, sir. Move aside, miss.
Can you step aside, please?

04:24.000 --> 04:27.276
- Please tell me-
- That's her.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.709
Miss, we'd like to have a word
to you about your dress.

04:29.840 --> 04:33.150
- What's wrong with it?
- You stole it. I saw you.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.316
Give me your work number,
and if she can't turn up a receipt...

04:38.440 --> 04:40.510
I can call you for a statement.

04:40.640 --> 04:43.313
Ask for Dianne,
Senior Store Detective.

04:43.440 --> 04:46.113
- Mind your head, please.
- I'm so pleased.

04:46.240 --> 04:49.152
I had the perfect arrest record
until I lost her in boys wear.

04:49.280 --> 04:50.998
How'd you know she'd be here?

04:51.120 --> 04:53.714
I didn't.
I'm the groom's cousin.

05:04.480 --> 05:06.869
It's as good as approved.
Well, no, it's not.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.152
But it will be. Porpoise Spit Council
backs me a hundred percent.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.555
- Look, we'II talk about it at dinner tonight.
- Around and around

05:13.680 --> 05:16.114
- Yeah, me whole family. Penelope!
- And around-

05:16.240 --> 05:19.312
Do that somewhere else, will ya?
Ask your mum to make a cup of tea!

05:19.440 --> 05:21.749
Mom, make Dad a cup of tea.

05:26.280 --> 05:29.272
Mom! Make Dad a cup of tea!

05:29.400 --> 05:31.675
- Me too.
- What?

05:32.880 --> 05:35.952
Tea? Oh, yes.

05:40.560 --> 05:43.028
- He got it! Look at that!
- Oh, man.

05:43.160 --> 05:45.435
Did you see that?
That was unreal.

06:13.640 --> 06:16.677
Muriel's back.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.870
Muriel, did you steal this dress?

06:19.000 --> 06:21.912
- No.
- Where'd you get the money to buy it?

06:22.040 --> 06:25.032
You haven't had a job in two years.

06:25.160 --> 06:28.232
- Mum gave it to me.
- Is this true?

06:28.360 --> 06:31.591
Um, no, I don't think so.

06:31.720 --> 06:34.359
Find the receipt. Go on!

06:37.760 --> 06:39.637
What happens
if she can't find it?

06:39.760 --> 06:43.116
We'II have to contact the store
and see if they want to press charges.

06:43.240 --> 06:47.119
- You know who I am?
- Yes, sir. Councillor Heslop.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.198
- Who are you?
- I'm Constable Saunders, and this is Constable Gillespie.

06:50.320 --> 06:54.313
Saunders? You're not
Graham Saunders' oldest boy, are you?

06:54.440 --> 06:56.670
- Brad.
- Young Brad.

06:56.800 --> 07:00.395
I haven't seen you since you played
fullback for the Porpoise Spit Giants!

07:00.520 --> 07:03.353
How's your dad? How's he
recovering from that stroke?

07:03.480 --> 07:05.516
- He's better than he was.
- You're terrible, Muriel.

07:05.640 --> 07:08.279
How about a beer? Cold one
before you go back to work?

07:08.400 --> 07:10.470
- Betty.
- Yes? What?

07:10.600 --> 07:13.353
- Get the young fellas a beer.
- Oh. Yes.

07:35.640 --> 07:38.029
You can dance

07:38.160 --> 07:40.355
You can jive

07:40.480 --> 07:43.950
Having the time of your life

07:44.080 --> 07:46.992
Ooh, see that girl

07:47.120 --> 07:49.315
Watch that scene

07:49.440 --> 07:53.319
Diggin' the dancing queen

07:59.600 --> 08:02.990
Friday night and the lights are low

08:04.480 --> 08:08.758
Looking out for a place to go

08:08.880 --> 08:11.474
- Where they play the right music
- See you, boys!

08:11.600 --> 08:13.477
- Getting in the swing
- See you, Bill.

08:13.600 --> 08:16.717
You come to look for a king

08:18.720 --> 08:22.998
Anybody could be that guy

08:23.120 --> 08:27.159
Night is young
and the music's high

08:29.760 --> 08:33.719
I think he'II enjoy that.
It's very good.

08:33.840 --> 08:37.309
Oh, honey prawns! Yes! Yum!

08:37.440 --> 08:41.513
Aw, look at that!
You're a wonderful man, Charlie Chan.

08:41.640 --> 08:43.312
- Thank you. - How's
your uncle? - Very well.

08:43.440 --> 08:46.273
I got his uncle out from China.
Talked to the boys from Immigration.

08:46.400 --> 08:49.437
Ian McKay and his blokes,
they got his uncle out from China.

08:49.560 --> 08:51.949
- This is a great man.
- Charlie.

08:52.080 --> 08:55.789
- This is Victor Keinosuke and his mate, uh, Akira.
- How do you do?

08:55.920 --> 08:57.956
They're building a resort
at Wallum Beach...

08:58.080 --> 09:01.629
and they might want a Chinese restaurant
in it, so keep the food comin'.

09:01.760 --> 09:04.320
- Please, please.
- Thank you. Thank you.

09:04.440 --> 09:07.193
It's all on the house.
I got his uncle out from China.

09:07.320 --> 09:09.709
You've done a lot for the people
of this town, Bill.

09:09.840 --> 09:12.035
- Who told you that?
- You did.

09:12.160 --> 09:16.119
Ah, well, um- I like helping out.
Ran for state government once.

09:16.240 --> 09:18.754
Joanie, stand up.
Show 'em your shirt.

09:21.840 --> 09:24.434
" Bill Heslop.
You can't stop progress. "

09:24.560 --> 09:29.111
- He lost.
- Yeah, well, missed on the postal vote.

09:29.240 --> 09:31.071
In a way, I'm glad
I didn't get in.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.395
I can do more for this place
at grass roots level.

09:33.520 --> 09:36.876
You know, high rise,
malls, resorts.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.074
Porpoise Spit Council
believes in progress. Muriel.

09:42.200 --> 09:45.875
When Victor was 19,
he was a millionaire.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.468
Muriel's on the dole.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.795
So is Perry.

09:50.920 --> 09:54.879
Well, I've got a job interview
next week. An apprentice locksmith.

09:55.000 --> 09:59.357
Oh, that sounds wonderful.
Doesn't it, Bill?

10:01.160 --> 10:03.628
A bit old for an apprentice,
aren't you?

10:03.760 --> 10:05.990
A bit old for everything!

10:06.120 --> 10:07.997
After she failed high school...

10:08.120 --> 10:10.714
I get her into a secretarial course
run by a mate of mine.

10:10.840 --> 10:15.630
$300 a term.
Two years, $2,000.

10:15.760 --> 10:18.718
- She comes out, she can't even type.
- I could type.

10:18.840 --> 10:21.149
Then I get her a job
at me solicitor's.

10:21.280 --> 10:24.556
After a month, Stevie Mason rings up
and says he'II have to let her go...

10:24.680 --> 10:26.557
'cause she can't type.

10:26.680 --> 10:29.513
If I couldn't type, why did they give me
my secretarial diploma?

10:29.640 --> 10:32.552
Because I paid for it!

10:32.680 --> 10:35.194
Sits around the house
like a dead weight...

10:35.320 --> 10:39.472
watching TV, sleeping all day,
getting arrested at weddings!

10:39.600 --> 10:41.477
You're useless.

10:43.480 --> 10:45.357
You're all useless.

10:49.760 --> 10:52.149
A bunch of useless no-hopers.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.873
Bill! Bill!

10:58.000 --> 10:59.877
- It's Deidre Chambers.
- What a go!

11:00.000 --> 11:01.558
- What a coincidence!
- What a coincidence!

11:01.680 --> 11:03.910
Deidre, pull up a chair.
Penelope, shift out.

11:04.040 --> 11:06.429
- Deidre, Victor Keinosuke and his mate Akira.
- Hello. Hello.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.596
All the way from China-
Uh, Japan.

11:08.720 --> 11:11.280
Deidre's a sales representative
for Radiant Cosmetics.

11:11.400 --> 11:15.439
- Beauty consultant, Bill.
- Sorry. Beauty consultant.

11:15.560 --> 11:17.790
" Sales representative"
sounds so common.

11:17.920 --> 11:21.754
I advise women on the right
lipstick, base and eyeliner.

11:21.880 --> 11:25.350
Of course, you'd know all about make-up.
Your wives are probably geishas.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.472
You look lovely, Deidre.

11:28.600 --> 11:31.353
Muriel, how was that wedding?

11:31.480 --> 11:34.631
- She was arrested.
- That's lovely.

11:34.760 --> 11:37.957
Don't you wish you were
22 again, Betty?

11:38.080 --> 11:40.435
Remember that age?

11:40.560 --> 11:42.516
Oh, yes. What?

11:42.640 --> 11:45.200
I bet you were a terror
when you were 22.

11:45.320 --> 11:47.754
Bill, was she a terror?

11:47.880 --> 11:49.836
Where's Charlie Chan
with that food?

11:49.960 --> 11:53.430
Oh, yes, where is he?

11:53.560 --> 11:56.518
Anyone? Oh, wait.
I think we've got a winner over here.

11:56.640 --> 11:58.517
Two new bars through there.

11:58.640 --> 12:01.154
Here she comes.
Give her a bit of a hand.

12:09.600 --> 12:12.751
Your dad was telling me
you're unemployed, Muriel.

12:15.480 --> 12:17.835
Would you like to work for me?

12:34.360 --> 12:36.874
- What's wrong?
- What's the matter?

12:37.000 --> 12:38.956
Yeah, tell us.
We won't tell anyone.

12:47.560 --> 12:50.552
Hello.

12:50.680 --> 12:54.036
Don't bottle it up, Tania.
You've got to let it out.

12:54.160 --> 12:56.958
You can tell us what happened.
We won't tell anyone.

13:02.600 --> 13:06.639
He- He couldn't do it...

13:08.360 --> 13:11.432
so I- you know.

13:13.080 --> 13:15.913
And I noticed there
was lipstick on it.

13:16.040 --> 13:18.759
- On what?
- His dick!

13:20.440 --> 13:23.113
He said he was having an affair.

13:23.240 --> 13:26.755
Who with?

13:26.880 --> 13:30.509
- Rose Biggs.
- Rose Biggs?

13:30.640 --> 13:33.757
Well, he said they don't sleep together.
She only sucks him off.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.713
Why?

13:36.840 --> 13:40.196
- Out of respect for me.
- Bitch.

13:40.320 --> 13:44.472
- Bastard.
- What am I gonna do? I'm a bride!

13:44.600 --> 13:47.637
I'm supposed to be euphoric!

13:47.760 --> 13:50.035
Come on the holiday with us!

13:50.160 --> 13:53.470
Cash in your ticket to Bali
and have your honeymoon with us.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.637
- Yeah.
- Yeah, come on, Tan.

13:56.760 --> 13:59.149
All right.

13:59.280 --> 14:02.033
We are gonna have the best time.
I'm so excited!

14:02.160 --> 14:04.720
What holiday?

14:06.240 --> 14:08.754
Just Hibiscus Island.

14:08.880 --> 14:11.599
We didn't think that you could afford it
because you don't have a job.

14:11.720 --> 14:16.635
Yes, I do. I got one last night.
I'm a beauty consultant.

14:16.760 --> 14:19.593
Let's tell her. We were
gonna tell her after the holiday...

14:19.720 --> 14:21.756
but I think we should tell her now.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.877
- Muriel-
- Wait!

14:28.360 --> 14:31.238
Let her finish her Orgasm.

14:51.320 --> 14:54.710
Muriel, people think we're mad.

14:54.840 --> 14:57.559
But that's just us.
We're ragers.

14:57.680 --> 15:01.116
People invite us to parties, and
they know we'II just have a good time.

15:01.240 --> 15:03.390
- We're mad.
- Party, party, party.

15:03.520 --> 15:06.398
That's our image.
You know what I mean.

15:07.720 --> 15:10.109
We're mad.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.754
We don't want you
hanging around us any more.

15:18.560 --> 15:20.630
I didn't steal the dress.
It was a mistake.

15:20.760 --> 15:22.751
It's not the dress, it's you.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.952
We've told you a thousand times how
to do your hair, but you never listen.

15:26.080 --> 15:28.674
- You never wear the right clothes.
- You're fat.

15:28.800 --> 15:32.236
You listen to '70s music.
This is the '90s.

15:32.360 --> 15:35.432
- We all listen to the Baby Animals.
- And Nirvana.

15:35.560 --> 15:39.314
- You bring us down, Muriel.
- You embarrass us.

15:39.440 --> 15:42.989
I, I know I'm not normal,
but I'm trying to change.

15:43.120 --> 15:45.554
I'm trying to become more like you,
more of a-

15:45.680 --> 15:48.069
- It's too late.
- But I can change!

15:48.200 --> 15:50.156
You'II still be you.

15:57.960 --> 16:03.034
Muriel, you've got to find
friends on your own level.

16:03.160 --> 16:06.994
Like I found Chook.
He's up on my level.

16:07.120 --> 16:12.274
Marrying him was
the happiest day of my life.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.950
I love him so much!

16:21.880 --> 16:24.519
That bastard!
I'II show him.

16:24.640 --> 16:28.349
I'II go on this holiday
and I'II sleep with a thousand men!

16:28.480 --> 16:30.357
I'm not nothing.

16:30.480 --> 16:33.756
Muriel, can't you think of anyone
but yourself? Tania's upset.

16:33.880 --> 16:35.950
I'm not nothing!

16:36.080 --> 16:38.753
Well, nobody said that.

16:38.880 --> 16:42.475
Oh, please don't chuck me
out of the group!

16:45.960 --> 16:50.158
Muriel. Muriel, you're
embarrassing us again!

16:57.880 --> 17:00.678
And Perry kicks!
He picks it up!

17:00.800 --> 17:03.598
" Go yourself! Go yourself!"
is the roar from the crowd.

17:03.720 --> 17:06.871
Heslop! Heslop! Heslop! Whoo!

17:07.000 --> 17:11.596
How can a man be so strong
and so fast? Heslop!

17:11.720 --> 17:13.597
Perry!

17:16.480 --> 17:18.357
Wake up to yourself!

17:22.079 --> 17:25.390
And Heslop's made a comeback!
How does he do it?

17:25.520 --> 17:28.159
- Did he apply for the police force?
- Yes, but they wouldn't let him sit for the test...

17:28.280 --> 17:31.317
'cause he was too tall.

17:31.440 --> 17:34.352
- Muriel up?
- Muriel!

17:34.480 --> 17:36.471
You've got to get up!
It's nearly 10:30!

17:36.600 --> 17:38.511
Make sure she sees Deidre Chambers
about that job.

17:38.640 --> 17:41.393
- Give her a blank cheque for the cosmetics.
- A blank cheque? How much for?

17:41.520 --> 17:44.353
It's a blank cheque. She fills in the
amount when Deidre tells her what it is.

17:44.480 --> 17:47.711
And tell Perry to mow that back yard.
Clean the place up. It's a pigsty.

17:47.840 --> 17:52.118
Joanie, will you turn off that television
and clean this place up? It's a pigsty.

17:52.240 --> 17:56.119
Muriel, you have to get up and go
and see Deidre Chambers about that job.

17:56.240 --> 17:59.835
- And I have to give you a blank cheque.
- Have you seen my smokes?

17:59.960 --> 18:02.474
It's wonderful for Deidre
to give you work.

18:02.600 --> 18:06.388
She's a wonderful person.
I don't care what anyone else says.

18:06.520 --> 18:10.559
- Mum?
- What who says?

18:10.680 --> 18:12.591
All those people
who've never liked Dad.

18:12.720 --> 18:15.314
Those greedies and those
terrible women at the post office.

18:15.440 --> 18:17.590
What are they saying?

18:19.440 --> 18:23.319
Do I make this out to Deidre Chambers
or Radiant Cosmetics?

18:23.440 --> 18:28.389
A blank cheque. Cash.

18:28.520 --> 18:31.592
What are they saying
about Deidre and Dad?

18:31.720 --> 18:34.439
They say that they
go driving at night...

18:34.560 --> 18:38.155
but he's only showing her
his developments.

18:38.280 --> 18:41.511
- His what?
- His building sites.

18:50.480 --> 18:53.119
I'm gonna be a success, Mum.

18:53.240 --> 18:56.152
I'm gonna get married,
and I'm gonna be a success.

18:56.280 --> 19:00.876
I know you are. Your dad just
wants to be proud of you, that's all.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.278
I'II show him.
I'II show them all.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.994
And now, everybody a big round of
applause as we welcome to the stage...

19:10.120 --> 19:12.076
act three in Hibiscus Island
Talent Quest.

19:12.200 --> 19:15.954
The Tropical Delights!
Let's hear it for the girls! Thank you!

19:24.120 --> 19:28.910
The tide is high
but I'm holding on

19:29.040 --> 19:33.591
I'm gonna be your number one

19:33.720 --> 19:40.273
I'm not the kind of girl
who gives up just like that

19:40.400 --> 19:42.277
Oh, no, oh

19:45.800 --> 19:48.075
- Hey, whose shout is it?
- Cheryl's.

19:48.200 --> 19:51.954
Cheryl's shout!

19:52.080 --> 19:54.355
- Muriel!
- Where did she get the money?

20:06.240 --> 20:09.232
Hi. What a coincidence.

20:11.120 --> 20:15.113
You're a mental case!
You keep away from us!

20:21.120 --> 20:24.157
You're got no dignity, Muriel.

20:49.760 --> 20:51.955
- Are you Muriel Heslop?
- No.

20:54.480 --> 20:56.038
- Yes, you are.
- Why?

20:56.160 --> 20:58.037
I don't know why.
You just are.

20:58.160 --> 21:00.196
Rhonda Epinstall.
We were in high school together.

21:00.320 --> 21:03.153
You dropped out in year ten.
I dropped out in year eleven.

21:03.280 --> 21:05.157
Ha! I knew it was you!

21:05.280 --> 21:08.033
- Hey, swap seats?
- Yeah, indeed.

21:08.160 --> 21:11.596
So, are you married now?

21:11.720 --> 21:13.756
- What?
- Well, you said you weren't Muriel Heslop.

21:13.880 --> 21:16.314
If you changed your name,
I thought you must have got married.

21:16.440 --> 21:19.113
No. Yes.

21:19.240 --> 21:21.549
- I'm engaged.
- Anyone I know?

21:21.680 --> 21:24.592
- What? Who? Tim.
- Who? - What?

21:24.720 --> 21:27.359
- Tim who?
- Simms.

21:27.480 --> 21:31.314
Tim Simms.
Don't know him. What's he like?

21:31.440 --> 21:35.991
- Um, like no one.
- Smoke?

21:36.120 --> 21:39.157
- What?
- I shouldn't. I'm an asthmatic.

21:40.280 --> 21:42.032
- So where is he?
- Who?

21:42.160 --> 21:44.151
Tim Simms.

21:47.720 --> 21:49.836
I'm on to you.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.871
You're not wearing
an engagement ring.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.956
You're here
without your fiance.

21:54.080 --> 21:57.675
You're out for a good time,
aren't you, Muriel? A last fling?

21:57.800 --> 21:59.836
I suppose so.

21:59.960 --> 22:03.669
You are wicked! Well, stick
with me, 'cause I'm wicked too.

22:03.800 --> 22:07.588
My whole life is one last fling
after another.

22:07.720 --> 22:10.712
Hey, remember Tania Degano?
She got married, to Chook.

22:10.840 --> 22:13.434
- To what?
- Chook. Peter Vernell.

22:13.560 --> 22:18.588
Oh, I remember them. What a pair
of assholes. They deserve each other.

22:18.720 --> 22:21.280
Whenever I think about
how revolting Porpoise Spit was...

22:21.400 --> 22:25.109
I think about Tania Degano and those
idiots that she used to hang out with.

22:25.240 --> 22:27.276
They made my life hell.

22:27.400 --> 22:32.838
Do you ever dream about what you
would say to them if you saw them now?

22:32.960 --> 22:35.918
I do see them now.
They're over there.

22:37.680 --> 22:41.468
- What are they doing here?
- They're on Tania's honeymoon.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.477
Chook couldn't come.

22:45.720 --> 22:47.756
- No, I-
- Tania!

22:50.080 --> 22:52.958
What a fantastic surprise.

22:53.080 --> 22:55.833
I don't believe it.

22:55.960 --> 22:59.430
I haven't seen you
since Porpoise Spit High.

22:59.560 --> 23:01.516
- How are you?
- Married.

23:01.640 --> 23:03.756
Muriel told me!

23:05.760 --> 23:07.591
- Turkey.
- Chook.

23:07.720 --> 23:11.030
Chook. That's right.
Well, congratulations!

23:15.160 --> 23:18.470
- Come and have a drink with us.
- Yeah.

23:18.600 --> 23:22.070
Really? You want
to have a drink with me?

23:22.200 --> 23:25.158
Well, we can't let you spend
the entire holiday alone.

23:25.280 --> 23:27.271
We're not in school
any more, Rhonda.

23:27.400 --> 23:30.551
You don't have to feel
you're not good enough for us now.

23:30.680 --> 23:35.754
- I don't.
- If I feel you've changed, I'II tell you.

23:35.880 --> 23:39.077
I'm honest,
unlike some people.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.236
- I tell it like it is.
- The truth?

23:41.360 --> 23:44.193
- Yes.
- I tell the truth too.

23:44.320 --> 23:47.039
Nicole's having
an affair with Chook.

23:47.160 --> 23:50.630
Muriel saw them fucking
in the laundry on your wedding day.

23:50.760 --> 23:52.751
Stick your drink
up your ass, Tania.

23:52.880 --> 23:56.156
I would rather swallow razor blades
than drink with you.

23:58.520 --> 24:03.150
Oh, by the way, I'm not alone.
I'm with Muriel.

24:08.080 --> 24:11.595
And now let's hear a warm welcome for act
five in the Hibiscus Island star search.

24:11.720 --> 24:14.598
- It's fabba ABBA!
- My, my

24:14.720 --> 24:19.271
At Waterloo
Napoleon did surrender

24:19.400 --> 24:20.992
Whoa, yeah

24:21.120 --> 24:24.078
And I have met my destiny

24:24.200 --> 24:27.033
In quite a similar way

24:27.120 --> 24:30.351
The history book on the shelf

24:30.480 --> 24:35.270
Is always repeating itself

24:35.400 --> 24:39.837
Waterloo, I was defeated
You won the war

24:41.600 --> 24:45.957
Waterloo, promise
to love you forevermore

24:48.000 --> 24:52.471
Waterloo, couldn't escape
if I wanted to

24:54.280 --> 24:58.831
Waterloo, knowing my fate
is to be with you

24:58.960 --> 25:01.952
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo

25:02.080 --> 25:04.958
I'm finally facing my Waterloo

25:09.600 --> 25:12.797
My, my
I tried to hold you back

25:12.920 --> 25:15.559
But you were stronger

25:15.680 --> 25:18.638
Oh, yeah
And now it seems

25:18.760 --> 25:23.675
My only chance
is giving up the fight

25:23.800 --> 25:26.314
And how could I ever refuse

25:26.440 --> 25:31.468
I feel like I win when I lose

25:31.600 --> 25:36.037
Waterloo, I was defeated
You won the war

25:38.160 --> 25:42.358
Waterloo, promise
to love you forevermore

25:44.600 --> 25:48.070
Waterloo, couldn't escape
if I wanted to

25:50.880 --> 25:55.556
Waterloo, knowing my fate
is to be with you

25:55.680 --> 25:58.114
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo

25:58.240 --> 26:01.437
I'm finally facing my Waterloo

26:03.240 --> 26:06.277
So how could I ever refuse

26:06.400 --> 26:09.710
I feel like I win when I lose

26:09.840 --> 26:13.515
- Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
- I'II kill you!

26:15.880 --> 26:20.635
Waterloo, knowing my fate
is to be with you

26:20.760 --> 26:23.593
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo

26:23.720 --> 26:26.871
I'm finally facing my Waterloo

26:27.000 --> 26:29.958
Ooh-ooh-ooh, Waterloo

26:30.080 --> 26:32.992
Knowing my fate
is to be with you

26:39.560 --> 26:43.712
" Dear Dad, the girls and I
are having a great time.

26:43.840 --> 26:47.355
Last night I sold a hundred dollars
worth of cosmetics...

26:47.480 --> 26:51.553
to Barry Crocker. Muriel. "

26:51.680 --> 26:54.752
A hundred dollars worth to
Barry Crocker, eh? How about that.

26:54.880 --> 26:58.634
P.S. I'm a fatso whale.

26:58.760 --> 27:01.320
This cosmetic thing is the best thing
that ever happened to Muriel.

27:01.440 --> 27:04.079
It really is.
She paid for this holiday herself.

27:04.200 --> 27:06.589
Bought clothes to wear,
new suitcases.

27:06.720 --> 27:09.632
Perry, you listening to this?
Eh?

27:09.760 --> 27:12.957
- I said, " yeah. "
- Well, so you should, you useless lump.

27:13.080 --> 27:14.957
Muriel's out there,
and she's made something of herself.

27:15.080 --> 27:18.152
And she was the most useless one
of all, wasn't she, Bill?

27:18.280 --> 27:20.635
Ah, she really impressed me.

27:20.760 --> 27:22.637
I told her that on the way
to the airport for this holiday.

27:22.760 --> 27:25.274
I said, " You've really impressed me.

27:25.400 --> 27:27.960
You can't type,
but you've really impressed me. "

27:28.080 --> 27:32.039
You know what they call this great man?
Bill the Battler.

27:32.160 --> 27:35.436
'Cause he's a little Aussie battler.

27:35.560 --> 27:39.348
- Been battling all me life.
- Battlin' for Porpoise Spit.

27:39.480 --> 27:43.871
Here's Deidre Chambers.
What a coincidence.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.549
- Deidre! Hey, Deidre!
- Bill! Hello.

27:47.680 --> 27:51.992
- What a coincidence.
- Take a seat. Penelope, shift over.

27:52.120 --> 27:55.032
Deidre, Leo Higgins.

27:55.160 --> 27:57.390
He's concreting Wallum Beach for us.

27:57.520 --> 28:01.274
- Hello, Leo.
- Deidre got Muriel into this cosmetics thing.

28:01.400 --> 28:05.109
Perry, show Deidre Muriel's postcard.

28:05.240 --> 28:07.754
Hibiscus Island. How about that?

28:10.080 --> 28:12.719
She should really
be sending you postcards, Deidre.

28:12.840 --> 28:15.354
You're the reason she's there.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.396
- Bill.
- I told you. I'm thinking about it.

28:21.520 --> 28:24.034
Not that. It's Muriel.

28:24.160 --> 28:27.311
In the past two weeks,
she's bought two kits from me...

28:27.440 --> 28:30.079
at a cost of $40 each.

28:30.200 --> 28:33.158
If she'd sold both kits
for the recommended price...

28:33.280 --> 28:36.158
she'd make $110...

28:36.280 --> 28:39.477
leaving her a profit of 30.

28:39.600 --> 28:43.036
- Thirty dollars.
- What are you talkin' about?

28:43.160 --> 28:45.435
She's on a $3,000 holiday.

28:45.560 --> 28:48.632
She's makin' a fortune.

28:48.760 --> 28:50.352
Isn't she?

28:55.480 --> 28:57.596
Do you think I could be famous?

28:57.720 --> 29:00.996
Sure. For what?

29:01.120 --> 29:04.715
Oh, I don't know.
I could be an actress.

29:04.840 --> 29:07.115
I'm mental enough.

29:10.920 --> 29:12.353
My, my

29:12.480 --> 29:16.678
At Waterloo
Napoleon did surrender

29:16.800 --> 29:18.950
Oh, yeah

29:23.920 --> 29:27.356
There was something
in the air that night

29:27.480 --> 29:30.199
The stars were bright

29:30.320 --> 29:33.039
Fernando

29:33.160 --> 29:36.994
They were shining there
for you and me

29:37.120 --> 29:41.352
For liberty, Fernando

29:41.480 --> 29:45.234
Though we never thought
that we could lose

29:45.360 --> 29:48.352
There's no regrets

29:48.480 --> 29:52.155
If I had to do the same again

29:52.280 --> 29:54.714
I would, my friend

29:54.840 --> 29:57.308
Fernando

29:57.440 --> 30:01.228
If I had to do the same again

30:01.360 --> 30:03.715
I would, my friend

30:03.840 --> 30:05.876
Fernando

30:14.120 --> 30:16.953
Do you ever think you're nothing?

30:19.680 --> 30:24.993
Sometimes I think I'm nothing.
Useless.

30:25.120 --> 30:30.035
You're not nothing, Muriel.
You're amazing.

30:31.720 --> 30:33.950
Remember how you were
in school?

30:34.080 --> 30:36.958
You were so quiet
you could hardly talk.

30:37.080 --> 30:40.117
You were too shy
to look at people.

30:40.240 --> 30:44.552
Now you're a success,
and someone wants to marry you.

30:46.080 --> 30:48.548
You're not nothing, Muriel.

30:50.720 --> 30:52.711
You've made it.

31:10.440 --> 31:13.159
Can you hear the drums, Fernando

31:15.160 --> 31:20.154
I remember long ago
another starry night like this

31:22.000 --> 31:26.391
In the firelight, Fernando

31:26.520 --> 31:31.036
You were humming to yourself
and softly strumming your guitar

31:31.160 --> 31:34.470
I could hear the distant drums
and sounds of bugle calls

31:34.600 --> 31:39.230
Were coming from afar

31:39.360 --> 31:43.876
They were closer now, Fernando

31:44.000 --> 31:48.437
Every hour, every minute
seemed to last eternally

31:50.600 --> 31:54.832
I was so afraid, Fernando

31:54.960 --> 31:59.317
We were young and full of life
and none of us prepared to die

31:59.440 --> 32:03.115
And I'm not ashamed to say
the roar of guns and cannons

32:03.240 --> 32:06.755
- Almost made me cry
- ... move it into the pillow.

32:06.880 --> 32:09.553
The pillow forms a perfect
sleeping cradle for your head and back.

32:09.680 --> 32:11.750
We all have a different shape
to the head and neck.

32:11.880 --> 32:14.269
- By sleeping on a pillow that fits perfectly with your shape...
- I'm back.

32:14.400 --> 32:17.710
- you relieve stress on muscles-
- You're terrible, Muriel.

32:17.840 --> 32:21.196
Muriel, Daddy's so angry.

32:21.320 --> 32:25.199
He's on his way back from the bank.
He'II want to talk to you.

32:25.320 --> 32:28.630
All our money's gone.
$12,000.

32:28.760 --> 32:32.196
You didn't do anything bad with those
blank cheques I gave you, did you?

32:32.320 --> 32:35.471
- You wouldn't do that to me, would you?
- Of course not.

32:49.040 --> 32:52.635
- There was something in the air that night
- Did you bring me a present?

32:52.760 --> 32:57.390
The stars were bright, Fernando

32:57.520 --> 33:00.751
They were shining there
for you and me

33:00.880 --> 33:05.032
For liberty, Fernando

33:05.160 --> 33:08.550
Though we never thought
that we could lose

33:08.680 --> 33:12.195
There's no regret

33:12.320 --> 33:15.392
- If I had to do the same again
- Where to, love?

33:15.520 --> 33:20.594
I would, my friend, Fernando

33:20.720 --> 33:23.837
If I had to do the same again

33:23.960 --> 33:28.033
I would, my friend, Fernando

33:38.160 --> 33:41.391
When the coach turns 'round
into Stableyard Grove...

33:41.520 --> 33:44.353
we will, for the first time,
see a glimpse of the bride...

33:44.480 --> 33:46.675
with her father,
the Earl Spencer...

33:46.800 --> 33:51.316
and we'II see that wedding dress which
has been kept such a wonderful secret.

33:51.440 --> 33:53.237
There we are.

33:54.280 --> 33:56.748
And what a bride-

34:04.960 --> 34:08.793
Quite a job, getting it.
All those yards of silk.

34:08.920 --> 34:13.118
Ah, what a dream she looks.
What a dream she looks.

34:13.239 --> 34:15.594
There's a bride any man
would be happy to see...

34:15.719 --> 34:18.792
coming down the aisle
towards him.

34:18.920 --> 34:22.356
The dress is made of yards
of ivory pure silk taffeta.

34:23.760 --> 34:26.114
It has big sleeves with-

34:33.960 --> 34:38.112
- Card number?
- Ninety-two. Brice Nobes.

34:39.960 --> 34:44.272
- You take out a lot of videos.
- Do I?

34:44.400 --> 34:47.949
You should join our video addicts club.
It's for people who take out too many videos.

34:48.080 --> 34:50.958
- Too many?
- Well, you know, a lot.

34:51.080 --> 34:53.116
You get a dollar off
every new release.

34:53.239 --> 34:58.109
Do you wanna go out with me?
You know, on a date.

35:01.040 --> 35:03.156
What?

35:03.280 --> 35:05.510
It's okay. You can say it.
I don't mind.

35:08.280 --> 35:10.475
- Videodrama.
- It's me.

35:10.600 --> 35:12.591
I still can't find any blokes
for us tomorrow night.

35:12.720 --> 35:14.995
Even Tony's busy,
and his leg's in a cast.

35:15.120 --> 35:18.317
- I've got one.
- You're racing off a customer.

35:18.440 --> 35:21.352
You have got the best job
for meeting men.

35:24.400 --> 35:26.914
Turn him around.
I can't see his face.

35:27.040 --> 35:30.953
- Can you look at that dry cleaners over there, please?
- Sure.

35:31.080 --> 35:33.514
- What do you think?
- It's great.

35:33.640 --> 35:35.870
Well, it's a start.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.958
Meet me for lunch.
I want to hear every detail.

35:41.680 --> 35:44.069
- You are wicked.
- This is my new life.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.509
I'm a new person.

35:46.640 --> 35:48.790
I'm changing my name to Mariel.

35:48.920 --> 35:54.278
- That is your name.
- No, Mariel. M-A-R-I-E-L.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.709
- Muriel- -
Mariel. - Mariel.

35:56.840 --> 35:59.559
Are you on the run
from the law?

36:01.280 --> 36:04.352
I don't care if you are.
I'd just like to know.

36:04.480 --> 36:09.349
Well, you know Tim,
my ex-fiance?

36:10.840 --> 36:12.956
He was a policeman.

36:13.080 --> 36:15.150
You jilted a cop?

36:16.680 --> 36:18.910
He's after you?

36:19.040 --> 36:22.953
Well, he said if I ever left him, he'd find
out who I was living with and shoot them.

36:23.080 --> 36:24.832
Then he'd shoot me,
then himself.

36:24.960 --> 36:28.748
Shit. He really
loved you, didn't he?

36:35.080 --> 36:37.150
Wow!

36:44.800 --> 36:48.679
- Rhonda's changed my life.
- She would.

36:52.160 --> 36:55.197
- Do you- Do you wanna
go somewhere else? - What?

36:55.320 --> 37:00.155
- Do you wanna go somewhere else?
- Oh, Rhonda wants to stay here.

37:00.280 --> 37:02.748
I'm going.
I've got a date.

37:05.080 --> 37:08.709
They're American.
Have fun.

37:08.840 --> 37:11.832
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

37:13.080 --> 37:15.719
Hi, guys!
I'm really excited.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.550
Do you wanna dance?

37:25.680 --> 37:28.035
I- I'm a terrible dancer.

37:28.160 --> 37:30.469
I don't care.

38:01.760 --> 38:05.639
Nice flat. Very spacious.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.355
- Cup of tea?
- Sure.

38:19.160 --> 38:22.118
Come here. Come here. Here.
Right there. Right there.

38:28.160 --> 38:32.073
You've been a bad boy! Yes!

38:32.200 --> 38:34.350
What a guy!

38:37.800 --> 38:40.758
- Bikkies?
- What? Sure.

38:46.360 --> 38:48.555
- Jump over the bed! Jump over it!
- Wait. Where is the bed?

38:48.680 --> 38:51.148
You get up here.
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

38:53.160 --> 38:57.472
- Oh, yes, sir.
- Oh, that's rude!

38:57.600 --> 39:00.672
- Ta.
- Oh, you wanna go faster.

39:00.800 --> 39:02.279
- Yeah, baby.
- Oh, push!

39:02.400 --> 39:06.029
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

39:06.160 --> 39:08.230
Oh, push.

39:08.360 --> 39:10.749
That's right. Faster.

39:15.400 --> 39:18.870
In tonight's news, holiday makers
and staff airlifted to safety...

39:19.000 --> 39:23.710
as Cyclone Terry devastates
the Hibiscus Island resort.

39:23.840 --> 39:26.308
Buildings and vegetation
were flattened in minutes...

39:26.440 --> 39:29.989
by winds of more than
160 kilometres per hour.

39:30.120 --> 39:32.634
- Rhonda and I went to that island.
- And the government inquiry...

39:32.760 --> 39:35.035
- Looks like fun.
- into corruption continued today...

39:35.160 --> 39:38.152
with president of the Porpoise Spit
council, Bill Heslop...

39:38.280 --> 39:40.236
- admitting that he received secret payments...
- Tim Tam?

39:40.360 --> 39:42.715
- Maybe after- Later.
- from a Japanese land developer.

39:42.840 --> 39:45.308
Councillor Heslop said
his judgment had been impaired...

39:45.440 --> 39:47.908
by the shock disappearance
of his daughter.

39:48.040 --> 39:51.157
- He made this emotional plea outside the inquiry.
- Mariel?

39:51.280 --> 39:52.793
- Muriel?
- Mariel.

39:52.920 --> 39:54.638
- Muriel...
- What?

39:54.760 --> 39:57.479
if you're watching this, we just
want to know you're all right, love.

39:57.600 --> 40:00.592
We don't care about the money.
The money doesn't matter.

40:00.720 --> 40:03.917
We just want to know
you're all right-

40:24.480 --> 40:29.508
I have to tell you something.
I'm a parking inspector.

40:31.440 --> 40:33.556
That's okay.

41:14.280 --> 41:16.475
- What did you do to her?
- Nothing.

41:16.600 --> 41:18.955
- Where do you think you're going? Come back.
- Ma'am. Hey, lady, are you all right?

41:19.080 --> 41:20.832
- Shit.
- On the ground.

41:20.960 --> 41:23.713
- Did he- What did he do to you?
- I didn't do anything!

41:23.840 --> 41:26.308
- Just shut up!
- What did he do?

41:26.440 --> 41:28.078
- Keep him down there!
- What are you doing?

41:28.200 --> 41:30.395
Are you all right?
Are you all right?

41:30.520 --> 41:32.670
Get the cops.
Call the cops!

41:32.800 --> 41:35.837
- Keep him down!
- I didn't do anything!

41:37.600 --> 41:41.912
Mariel.
I can't move my legs.

41:45.600 --> 41:47.830
...crept back into his kennel
early this morning.

41:47.960 --> 41:51.589
At this stage, no questions are being
asked about his mystery escapade.

42:00.080 --> 42:04.551
Well, just keep an eye on him.
The doctor will see him. Okay?

42:17.960 --> 42:22.954
- Hello?
- It's me. Muriel.

42:23.080 --> 42:27.153
- You're terrible, Muriel.
- Why is Dad on TV?

42:27.280 --> 42:30.158
The inquiry. They're saying
he takes bribes.

42:30.280 --> 42:33.875
- Does he?
- Yeah, but he had to 'cause you stole all our money.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.594
- Was that the telephone ringing?
- Dad's moved out.

42:36.720 --> 42:39.996
He says it's all Mum's fault
'cause she gave you the cheques.

42:40.120 --> 42:42.236
He's living in a hotel.

42:42.360 --> 42:45.238
- Who is it? Is it Dad?
- Muriel.

42:45.360 --> 42:47.749
Muriel. Oh.

42:47.880 --> 42:50.235
Mum wants to talk to you.

42:50.360 --> 42:53.272
Muriel, are you all right?

42:53.400 --> 42:57.188
We didn't know what had happened to you. We
thought you'd become a prostitute or a drug addict.

42:57.320 --> 42:59.231
I'm in Sydney.

42:59.360 --> 43:01.715
Dad's in Sydney for the inquiry.

43:01.840 --> 43:04.559
He'd love to see you.
Where are you staying?

43:07.040 --> 43:09.076
He just wants to know
you're all right.

43:09.200 --> 43:12.237
- Joan said he's moved out.
- No.

43:12.360 --> 43:16.035
Well, w-well, yes,
but only for his health.

43:17.480 --> 43:20.278
Dr Farrell says
he needs a holiday from us.

43:20.400 --> 43:22.595
I know he blames me
for you taking the money...

43:22.720 --> 43:25.678
but I never thought
you'd do a thing like that.

43:25.800 --> 43:28.598
Maybe it was a mistake
at the bank...

43:28.720 --> 43:30.870
or I wrote the wrong figure
on the cheque.

43:32.200 --> 43:34.668
No, I took it.

43:38.240 --> 43:40.117
Yes, maybe you did.

43:40.240 --> 43:42.390
Mum, the federal police are here.

43:42.520 --> 43:45.318
Oh, I have to go.
We're being raided again.

43:45.440 --> 43:47.635
- What's your phone number?
- Uh, I don't have a phone.

43:47.760 --> 43:50.115
- Well, what's your address?
- Look, I'II call you later.

43:50.240 --> 43:54.028
- Well, ring Dad. He's at the Hilton.
- Mrs Heslop, we wanna ask you some questions about Bill.

43:54.160 --> 43:57.118
And don't lie to us.
We know everything.

44:01.240 --> 44:05.028
This tumour is pressing
on the spinal cord...

44:05.160 --> 44:08.277
interrupting the flow
of electricity to your legs.

44:08.400 --> 44:12.439
The operation will remove
that pressure.

44:12.560 --> 44:16.553
I'd, uh, like to do it soon,
in the next 24 hours.

44:20.880 --> 44:23.474
How did I get it?

44:23.600 --> 44:27.639
I mean, it's nothing to do
with too much sex, is it?

44:27.760 --> 44:31.355
No, no. Nothing like that.

44:31.480 --> 44:34.870
- We don't know what causes
cancer. - Cancer? - Cancer?

44:35.000 --> 44:37.878
You never said anything about cancer.

44:38.000 --> 44:42.118
- That's what the tumour is. It's a can-
- I've got cancer!

44:42.240 --> 44:45.357
Oh, God! I'm gonna go bald
and have to eat macrobiotic food!

44:45.480 --> 44:49.234
We're not talking about radiotherapy.
This is a discreet tumour.

44:49.360 --> 44:53.751
Alone. Isolated. The operation's
all we need for the moment.

44:53.880 --> 44:58.271
- For the moment?
- There's a minor risk of damage to the spinal cord.

44:58.400 --> 45:02.951
- What does that mean?
- It means I'm up shit creek, that's what it means.

45:58.960 --> 46:01.030
Silk chantel.

46:02.640 --> 46:05.632
Imported.

46:05.760 --> 46:08.433
When's your big day?

46:08.560 --> 46:11.757
Your wedding day?

46:11.880 --> 46:16.874
- September.
- Spring. Ivory.

46:54.240 --> 46:57.277
- What's your fiance's name?
- Bill.

46:57.400 --> 46:59.868
Well, Bill's
in for a big surprise.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.912
- Will your mother be coming to see the dress?
- No.

47:03.040 --> 47:06.555
No, she can't.
She's in hospital.

47:06.680 --> 47:09.558
She's got a tumour in her spine.

47:09.680 --> 47:12.148
She has to have an operation.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.560
We don't usually do this.

47:20.880 --> 47:23.269
But your mother has to see
how beautiful you look in that dress.

48:05.600 --> 48:08.160
Doing well.
Isn't she doing well, Mariel?

48:08.280 --> 48:10.840
- You're doing really well.
- Now this foot forward.

48:10.960 --> 48:14.555
You can do it. Good.

48:14.680 --> 48:17.148
Now the other one.

48:18.640 --> 48:21.154
Good. That's good.

48:22.960 --> 48:25.110
And-

48:29.360 --> 48:32.636
- I have to sit down.
- Come on.

48:32.760 --> 48:35.957
- I have to sit down!
- All right. I've got you.

48:37.680 --> 48:41.912
Don't panic. Swing around.

48:42.040 --> 48:45.350
That's it. Hand back.

48:45.480 --> 48:47.038
Take a break, honey.

48:47.160 --> 48:49.549
You're doing really well.

48:53.840 --> 48:56.559
How can you stand this?

48:56.680 --> 49:00.195
You push me around in this chair.
You cook for me.

49:00.320 --> 49:02.311
You even help me dress.
I hate it!

49:04.440 --> 49:07.034
When I lived in Porpoise Spit,
I'd just stay in my room for hours...

49:07.160 --> 49:09.515
and listen to ABBA songs.

49:09.640 --> 49:12.950
Sometimes I'd stay in there
all day.

49:13.080 --> 49:14.957
But since I've met you
and moved to Sydney...

49:15.080 --> 49:18.390
I haven't listened
to one ABBA song.

49:18.520 --> 49:21.990
It's because now my life's
as good as an ABBA song.

49:22.120 --> 49:24.554
It's as good as " Dancing Queen. "

49:26.160 --> 49:28.151
Come off it.

49:32.360 --> 49:34.078
Promise me something.

49:34.200 --> 49:38.398
- We never go back there.
- What do you mean?

49:38.520 --> 49:42.433
I mean, I can't go back
and live in Porpoise Spit with Mum.

49:42.560 --> 49:45.950
- Not in a wheelchair, not with her.
- You're gonna walk.

49:47.480 --> 49:50.278
Promise we never go back.

49:50.400 --> 49:52.755
I promise.

49:55.360 --> 49:58.352
But you're gonna walk.

50:10.280 --> 50:12.555
I believe
there's something out there.

50:12.680 --> 50:15.877
- Yeah. I'm-I'm not a sceptic about it.
- I've been cheated by you

50:16.000 --> 50:21.074
- Since I don't know when
- Too many people have seen it. There's been too much documentation.

50:21.200 --> 50:22.758
So I made up my mind

50:22.880 --> 50:26.350
- It must come to an end
- Taxi for the rehabilitation centre?

50:26.480 --> 50:29.438
- Hang on. I have to get my
smokes. - Look at me now - Okay.

50:29.560 --> 50:33.030
Will I ever learn
I don't know how

50:33.160 --> 50:36.232
But I suddenly lose control

50:36.360 --> 50:39.875
There's a fire within my soul

50:40.000 --> 50:43.231
Just one look
and I can hear a bell ring

50:43.360 --> 50:46.750
One more look
and I forget everything

50:46.880 --> 50:51.351
Oh-oh-oh, Mamma mia
Here I go again

50:51.480 --> 50:54.631
My, my, how can I resist you

50:54.760 --> 50:58.036
Mamma mia, does it show again

50:58.160 --> 51:01.391
My, my, just how much
I've missed you

51:01.520 --> 51:04.796
Yes, I've been broken-hearted

51:04.920 --> 51:08.071
Blue since the day we parted

51:08.200 --> 51:11.431
Why, why did I ever let you go

51:11.560 --> 51:14.836
Mamma Mia, now I really know

51:14.960 --> 51:18.157
My, my, I could never let you go

51:24.840 --> 51:28.753
I've been angry and sad
about things that you do

51:31.520 --> 51:35.433
I can't count all the times
that I've told you we're through

51:38.280 --> 51:41.431
- And when you go When you slam the door
- Keep going.

51:41.560 --> 51:46.759
I think you know
that you won't be away too long

51:46.880 --> 51:50.634
You know that I'm not that strong

51:50.760 --> 51:53.672
- Just one look and I can hear-
- Stop the car!

51:57.600 --> 51:59.670
Beautiful.

52:01.280 --> 52:05.273
I hope the photos help your sister
out of that coma.

52:05.400 --> 52:09.313
- Mariel! What are you doing?
- No-Nothing.

52:09.440 --> 52:11.431
Why didn't you tell me
you were gonna marry Tim?

52:11.560 --> 52:15.758
- Who? - Tim Simms, your fiance-
the one who wants to shoot you.

52:15.880 --> 52:19.077
Now, now, now, now just a minute. You
can't come in here and threaten brides.

52:19.200 --> 52:21.839
- I don't care how unfortunate you are.
- Fuck off.

52:21.960 --> 52:24.918
What is going on, Mariel?

52:25.040 --> 52:27.918
I've seen your wedding album.
You've tried on every dress in Sydney.

52:28.040 --> 52:30.713
- That doesn't mean I'm getting married.
- What else does it mean?

52:30.840 --> 52:34.150
I wanna get married.
I've always wanted to get married.

52:34.280 --> 52:37.397
If I can get married, it means
I've changed- I'm a new person.

52:37.520 --> 52:41.229
- How?
- Because who would want to marry me?

52:43.720 --> 52:47.599
- Tim Simms.
- There is no Tim Simms. I made him up.

52:47.720 --> 52:50.280
In Porpoise Spit,
no one would even look at me.

52:50.400 --> 52:53.597
But when I came to Sydney
and became Mariel, Brice asked me out.

52:53.720 --> 52:55.995
And that proves
I'm already different than I was...

52:56.120 --> 52:58.554
and if someone wants to marry me,
I'm not her any more.

52:58.680 --> 53:00.716
- I'm me.
- Her?

53:00.840 --> 53:03.070
Muriel! Muriel Heslop!

53:03.200 --> 53:05.919
Stupid, fat and useless!
I hate her!

53:06.040 --> 53:09.157
I'm not going back
to being her again!

53:11.560 --> 53:13.835
Why can't it be me?

53:15.160 --> 53:17.355
Why can't I be the one?

53:25.920 --> 53:28.354
Have you been in a coma?

53:53.760 --> 53:55.830
Rhonda?

53:57.280 --> 53:59.430
Dad.

54:02.560 --> 54:05.154
If they have a copy of this document,
then the option is...

54:05.280 --> 54:08.556
giving you a doctor's certificate
saying you are unfit to testify.

54:08.680 --> 54:11.752
Can I have that title deed, Paul?
That's the one.

54:11.880 --> 54:15.714
We can only assume that Victor Keinosuke
has given them a copy of this deed.

54:15.840 --> 54:18.991
Muriel, why'd you do it to me?

54:19.120 --> 54:21.634
I gave you money. I got you jobs.

54:21.760 --> 54:24.035
I put her through
this secretarial course.

54:24.160 --> 54:26.628
$2,000 for two years, it cost me.

54:26.760 --> 54:28.830
Comes out, she can't even type.

54:28.960 --> 54:31.679
I get her into selling cosmetics.
We all think she's making a go of it.

54:31.800 --> 54:36.112
Turns out she's robbin' us blind.
You're a disgrace, an absolute disgrace!

54:36.240 --> 54:39.232
A- Are you Bill the Battler?

54:39.360 --> 54:42.909
I saw you on TV.
Can I please have your autograph?

54:43.040 --> 54:45.315
Me and my dad think
that you're not guilty, Bill.

54:45.440 --> 54:47.510
I've changed my name to Mariel.

54:47.640 --> 54:50.108
Good on you, son.
You spread it around.

54:50.240 --> 54:53.596
You can't stop progress!

54:53.720 --> 54:56.029
You're comin' back to Porpoise Spit
with me.

54:56.160 --> 54:58.720
We'II leave in three weeks,
once this inquiry crap's over.

54:58.840 --> 55:01.308
- I can't go back. I'm a new person.
- You're a thief.

55:01.440 --> 55:05.149
The only reason I never got the coppers
onto you is your mother begged me not to.

55:05.280 --> 55:08.113
I want that money back.
I'II get you a job at the Leagues Club.

55:08.240 --> 55:09.639
I'II arrange a bank loan for you.

55:09.760 --> 55:11.955
You're going to make up
for what you've done, Muriel.

55:14.560 --> 55:19.509
It's Deidre Chambers.
Deidre! Deidre!

55:19.640 --> 55:22.712
Hey, Deidre!

55:22.840 --> 55:26.515
Bill!

55:26.640 --> 55:28.631
What a coincidence!
What are you doing in Sydney?

55:28.760 --> 55:30.955
Well, my sister lives in Sydney.
I'm down for the long weekend.

55:31.080 --> 55:33.548
- Pull up a chair. - What a coincidence!
- My barrister, Graham Newman.

55:33.680 --> 55:35.477
- His two solicitors, and Muriel you know about.
- Hello.

55:35.600 --> 55:38.637
It's Mariel!

55:40.000 --> 55:44.551
We should get back, Bill. Victor
Keinosuke's testimony starts at 3:00.

55:44.680 --> 55:47.240
That Jap bastard! He's gonna testify
that I took bribes from him.

55:47.360 --> 55:51.148
- Commissions.
- Commissions. I took commissions.

55:51.280 --> 55:54.795
Cut through all that red tape for him.
I deserve some sort of acknowledgement.

55:54.920 --> 55:57.309
They'd never have got to build
that resort on Crown Land without me.

55:57.440 --> 56:00.159
- It was the Crown Land that did it.
- Total overreaction.

56:00.280 --> 56:04.114
- There were aboriginals living on it.
- The federal police raided the house.

56:04.240 --> 56:05.958
Your mother just let them walk in.

56:06.080 --> 56:08.230
She and Perry made statements-
told them I had money problems.

56:08.360 --> 56:10.635
- Don't think about it.
- Of course I had money problems.

56:10.760 --> 56:13.228
- She stole most of it.
- You need your family around you.

56:13.360 --> 56:15.351
If the Feds come near you,
don't you say a word.

56:15.480 --> 56:19.109
- Are you and Deidre together?
- What?

56:22.280 --> 56:24.475
Have you left Mum for Deidre?

56:29.600 --> 56:33.229
Yes. We're in love.

56:38.280 --> 56:39.998
What about Mum?

56:42.760 --> 56:46.070
What happiness has your father had
in his life if he doesn't have me?

56:46.200 --> 56:49.078
- What about Mum?
- She'II have you.

56:49.200 --> 56:51.350
You got three weeks.

57:11.160 --> 57:15.119
It's come back- the tumour.

57:17.200 --> 57:20.749
I have to have another operation.

57:20.880 --> 57:22.757
I'm not gonna walk.

57:24.600 --> 57:28.388
But what about
your rehabilitation?

57:30.480 --> 57:33.278
They're gonna cut
my spinal cord, Mariel.

57:35.920 --> 57:37.911
Mum called.

57:38.040 --> 57:42.238
She wants to take me back
to Porpoise Spit.

57:42.360 --> 57:45.272
I told her I was gonna
stay here with you.

58:17.760 --> 58:21.673
Head down! Head down!
Come on! Come on! Swing it!

58:21.800 --> 58:25.588
Blokes with no legs and no arms
cut through the water faster than that!

58:25.720 --> 58:28.553
Look at that! You're going through there
like a constipated duck!

58:28.680 --> 58:31.513
Look at 'em flopping around
all over the place!

58:31.640 --> 58:34.074
Burchett, what do you think this is,
synchronized swimming?

58:34.200 --> 58:37.590
Water aerobics for geriatrics?
You're supposed to be a sprinter!

58:37.720 --> 58:39.233
Go! Go! Go! Go!

58:42.000 --> 58:43.911
Mariel?

58:45.400 --> 58:48.358
Ken Blundell. How are ya?

58:49.320 --> 58:50.992
Van Arkle!

58:55.000 --> 58:58.151
I think we found you a girl.

59:09.080 --> 59:11.913
David Van Arkle, Mariel Heslop.

59:20.760 --> 59:24.469
Mariel, you've probably seen the news
about the civil war in South Africa.

59:24.600 --> 59:27.717
Well, just as the South Africans seem to
be doing the right thing by the blacks...

59:27.840 --> 59:31.674
the police open fire on a black soccer
club, and that is bad news for David.

59:32.760 --> 59:36.833
- Are you black?
- What?

59:39.680 --> 59:41.830
I don't know why I said that.

59:41.960 --> 59:44.349
Well, well, it is funny, in a way.

59:44.480 --> 59:47.756
But let's be honest. The South Africans
were never much chop in the pool anyway.

59:47.880 --> 59:50.075
David here
is a bit of a freak, really.

59:50.200 --> 59:52.395
And I think that he is gonna get
the gold medal...

59:52.520 --> 59:56.877
for the 1,500 metres
in the next Olympic Games.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.560
Mariel, how did you feel
when Kieren Perkins...

59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.557
took gold for Australia
at Barcelona?

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:07.752
- Who?
- Kieren Perkins.

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:09.916
- He's an Australian champion.
- Now, David's family...

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:13.669
are willing to do anything to see him
fulfil his potential as a champion...

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:16.439
even if it means swimming
for another country.

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:20.109
And they're willing to pay
$10,000...

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:23.471
to the girl that'II help Dave out.

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:27.275
Are you from Sydney originally?

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:30.119
What? No, Porpoise Spit.

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:32.913
A- And why did you leave there?

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:37.830
Well, because of all the mental things
that happened to me.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:42.192
I got shallow, and my physical being
could have been improved...

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:44.788
and as well as my mentality.

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:46.831
- What about the black-haired one?
- No, she was Turkish.

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.916
She's only been in the country
five minutes.

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:51.315
Now, whoever marries David
will have to...

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.715
tell the immigration authorities
that they're in love with him.

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:55.831
Now there'II be media attention...

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:58.474
so they'II have to live with David
in his flat...

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:01.558
for at least four months
after the marriage.

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:04.035
I've worked out all the details
of the romance...

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.469
which you and David
will have to stick to.

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.955
But the most important thing
is to convince people...

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:11.275
that you two are really in love.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:12.992
- What about the blonde?
- You didn't like her.

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:16.237
- I'm not so sure now.
- Now, I think Mariel might be...

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:19.193
just what we're looking for.

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:23.074
Well, it's up to you now, love.
Would you find it difficult to lie?

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:26.716
I could try.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:28.637
Well, don't rush your decision...

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:31.513
but if you could let us know
by tomorrow morning.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:42.952
You can dance, you can jive

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:46.277
Having the time of your life

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:51.269
Ooh, see that girl
Watch that scene

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:55.757
Diggin' the dancing queen

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:30.597
I know you couldn't have got up onto the altar, but
at least she could have asked you to be bridesmaid.

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:34.110
- She did.
- Why didn't you say yes?

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.037
You could have been on television.

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:38.151
I don't want to sit up here, Mum.

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:41.955
- I wanna sit in the corner.
- No one'II see you over there.

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:46.874
Well, if this is your attitude,
I don't know why you bothered coming.

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:56.872
At least you won't
be in anyone's way.

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:11.830
Rhonda?

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:16.117
Is that you?

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:21.557
- You're the bridesmaids?
- Isn't it fantastic?

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:24.990
- We always knew Mariel'd come good.
- She's in all the papers.

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:28.715
- What happened to you?
- I had cancer.

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:33.356
It's all right. They cut it out.
I won't walk again though.

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:39.476
- You were so full of life.
- I'm not dead, Cheryl.

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:44.635
Come on. We better get ready.
Mariel's coming.

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:47.638
You must be so happy for her.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.395
God, she has cancer!

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:55.034
I'm divorcing Chook.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:57.913
I suppose I have you
to thank for that.

01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:01.350
I hope I can do the same
for you one day.

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:25.713
You told me it would be
a quick civil ceremony.

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:28.229
Ah, it's good she wanted
a church wedding. It's romantic.

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:31.113
It looks like you mean it.

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:34.915
All the guests are on her side.
I should have hired you some friends.

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.837
The charges don't surprise me.

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:38.757
The bastards have been out to get me
from the beginnin'.

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.677
I just wanted you to know-

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:49.035
Mariel, are you marrying David
for money?

01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:51.355
Is this a marriage
of convenience, Mariel?

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:53.357
Mariel, how long have you and David-

01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:56.756
Your Mum's arriving in Sydney by bus
because I can't afford a plane ticket.

01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:58.677
- You see what you've done to me?
- Where is she now?

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:00.631
I don't know.
Trying to get a taxi, I suppose.

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:14.509
Mariel.

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:16.437
You're beautiful.

01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:01.038
Love me or leave me

01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:05.597
Make your choice, but believe me

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:08.154
I love you

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:12.398
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:17.792
I can't conceal it

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:22.038
Don't you see
Can't you feel it

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:24.674
Don't you too

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:28.873
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:34.190
Oh, I've been dreaming

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:40.270
Through my lonely past

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:43.392
Now I just made it

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:46.910
I've found you at last

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:50.794
So come on now
Let's try it

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:55.038
I love you, you can't deny it

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:56.878
- 'Cause it's true
- Oh, God.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:02.279
- Don't panic. Think of the games.
- I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:06.397
She's all yours, mate.

01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:18.350
Father, when You created mankind, You
willed that man and wife should be one.

01:08:18.479 --> 01:08:21.278
- Join David and Muriel-
- Mariel.

01:08:21.399 --> 01:08:24.278
Mariel in the loving union
of marriage...

01:08:24.399 --> 01:08:26.993
so that they may be living witness
to Your divine love in the world.

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:31.154
David, do you take Mariel
to be your wife?

01:08:31.279 --> 01:08:33.794
Do you promise to be true to her
in good times and in bad...

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:37.959
in sickness and in health- to love and
honour her all the days of your life?

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:48.792
Uh, yeah. Okay.
All right. Why not? I do.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.911
Mariel, do you take David
to be your husband?

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.600
Do you promise to be true to him
in good times and in bad...

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:56.996
in sickness and in health- to love and
honour him all the days of your life?

01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:59.554
I do.

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:02.478
You have declared your consent
before the Church.

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:06.593
May the Lord strengthen that consent
and fill you with His blessings.

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:11.270
What God has joined,
men must not divide.

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:31.796
Mariel, take this ring
as a sign of my, uh-

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:37.153
- Love and fidelity.
- Love and fidelity.

01:09:37.279 --> 01:09:41.353
- In the name of the Father- - In the name
of the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit.

01:09:41.479 --> 01:09:44.790
David, I take this ring
as a sign of your love and fidelity...

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:48.799
in the name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit.

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:51.229
I now pronounce you man and wife.

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:55.349
Congratulations.

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.954
You may kiss your bride.

01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:33.988
Congratulations! Oh, David!

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:44.472
Good on you.

01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:46.955
- Mr Heslop.
- It's Bill.

01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:48.957
Mrs Heslop.

01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:59.713
- Thanks.
- Mariel, congratulations.

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:05.198
- Thank you.
- You look lovely. Have every success.

01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:07.117
Well done, love.

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.278
Good on you.

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:29.116
- How do you feel?
- He's fighting fit.

01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:32.198
The next gold you'II see on this hand will
be the gold medal for the 1,500 metres!

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:34.276
- You reckon?
- Oh, yes.

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:36.789
Mariel and us have been friends for
years. We went to Hibiscus Island together.

01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:38.478
- We're like sisters.
- She's my best friend.

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:43.276
- I-I tell her everything.
- Mariel! Oh, you look beautiful!

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.630
Oh, isn't she beautiful?

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:47.919
She is wearing the make-up,
isn't she?

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:54.437
Smile.

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:07.435
- I was tryin' to hide from you.
- I saw your wheels.

01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:13.798
- I didn't think you'd come.
- I had to see it for myself.

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:15.950
Just the bridesmaids were worth it.

01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:21.315
I didn't call them.
They came crawling back to me.

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:23.556
The way they picked on me
in Porpoise Spit...

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:25.477
saying I wouldn't amount to anything-

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:29.434
And here I am, famous,
and they're at my wedding.

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:32.597
- I showed them.
- Showed them what?

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:34.836
I'm as good as they are.

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:40.552
I have to go.
Good luck with what's his name.

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:42.750
Where are you going?

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:46.270
Where do you think?
Back to Porpoise Spit with Mum.

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:50.632
- We're catching the bus out tonight.
- I don't want you to.

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:54.150
Well, you should have thought of that
before you gave up on me.

01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:56.794
I couldn't pay all the rent without you.
I couldn't even do the shopping.

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:01.509
I needed help.
I needed a friend.

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:04.108
I mean, I don't want you
to go back by bus.

01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:06.754
I bought you two plane tickets.

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:11.038
Go to hell.

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:13.879
I already gave 'em to your mum.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.231
You're right.
You are a new person, and you stink.

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:19.635
Mariel Van Arkle stinks!

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:22.832
And she's not half the person
Muriel Heslop was.

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:26.157
Rhonda, your mum just told us
you're moving back to Porpoise Spit.

01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:29.511
- It'II be just like old times.
- Don't worry about Rhonda, Mrs E.

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:31.756
We'II push her around.

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:01.757
- Are you rich?
- My parents own it.

01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:07.072
- They didn't come to the wedding.
- No.

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:10.351
They paid for it.

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:15.315
They're in Johannesburg.
Kitchen, lounge room, gym.

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:18.273
You can use everything
but the weights.

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:20.868
Bathroom, my room.

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:31.953
Your room.

01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:34.958
I'm going downstairs
for a swim.

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:44.871
It wasn't just the money, was it?

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:51.309
What kind of person
marries someone they don't know?

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:55.836
You did.

01:14:55.960 --> 01:15:00.078
I want to win.
All my life I've wanted to win.

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:03.238
Me too.

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:46.558
$84.20. $84.20.

01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:51.391
Ninety-nine cents.

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:54.757
Ninety, one hundred.

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:58.031
Thanks, Mrs Heslop.
Have a nice day.

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:03.436
You can see she's not right
in the head.

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:07.314
- Look, I'II see what I can do, Bill.
- You're a mate. I won't forget it.

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:09.510
I'II be in touch.

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:16.550
I meant to pay.

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:26.759
I need help-
around the house, and-

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:30.711
3:00 news update.

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:47.312
Not comin' back.
I want a divorce.

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:49.556
I'm marrying Deidre.

01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:54.677
You know what they say?

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:56.711
They say that I wasn't elected
to the state government that time...

01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:58.319
because my family
wasn't up to scratch.

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:02.353
That's what they say.
Look at this place!

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:04.948
I never had a bloody chance!

01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:50.308
Get out!
Get out and find yourself a job!

01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:54.558
Get out, you layabout,
and stop embarrassing your father!

01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:57.353
- You're an embarrassment!
- You're the embarrassment!

01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:59.755
You mad bitch!

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:05.117
Oh, no.

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:15.474
Mariel Van Arkle speaking.

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:21.832
- Hello?
- Muriel?

01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:24.793
- Mariel.
- Mum's died.

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:27.753
- What?
- We're all at the hospital.

01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:31.634
Dad says you have to come home.

01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:59.638
Yeah.

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:03.150
The funeral's tomorrow.
Are you coming?

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:05.589
Russell's gonna be there.

01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:10.555
Yeah. I invited him.
He says he's gonna bring Alan.

01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:12.557
Hi.

01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:20.118
- Hi.
- Mariel?

01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:22.549
Is that you?

01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:24.557
Not sure.

01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:36.190
It was a heart attack.

01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:38.550
Joanie found her.

01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:41.752
She was lying on the bed,
looking peaceful.

01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:43.871
She didn't suffer.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.198
She made the ultimate sacrifice
for your father.

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:53.792
Judge will be lenient on him now.
He's got kids to support.

01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:57.754
She'd be glad, in the end,
her life amounted to something.

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:01.475
Deidre, I finished up
in the bathroom.

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:04.797
You were right
about those cupboards.

01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:07.712
Let's start on the laundry then.

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:10.149
It's a big job.

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:42.478
- What happened?
- Mum burnt it.

01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:48.356
Why?

01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:51.836
Because she got sick and tired
of waiting for Perry to mow it.

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.717
Hi.

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:13.554
What am I gonna do without her?

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:26.955
Her photo album.

01:23:56.440 --> 01:24:02.436
She took pills- sleeping pills.

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:05.597
They were next to her
when I found her.

01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:09.554
And when Dr Farrell come,
they were gone.

01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:12.399
And when I asked
what happened to 'em...

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:14.829
Dad said he didn't want anyone
to know.

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:18.350
Dr Farrell said
Dad had been through enough.

01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:25.031
I don't know. Maybe he has.

01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:36.039
The Lord is good to me

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:40.073
His word my hope

01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:44.159
Secures

01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:48.319
He will my shield

01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:52.433
And portion be

01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:56.599
As long as life

01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:01.157
Endures

01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:11.032
I have a telefax to read.

01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:14.038
Keep your eye
on them journalist bastards.

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:20.158
" To Bill Heslop and Family...

01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:25.673
Hazel and I were sorry
to hear of the passing of Betty.

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:29.509
We are thinking of you
in your time of sorrow. "

01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:33.349
Signed, the honourable Bob Hawke...

01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:36.950
former prime minister
of Australia.

01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:40.231
- What are they doin'?
- They're, they're writin' it down.

01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:43.636
I'II bet they are. Put that
in your papers, you mongrel bastards.

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:47.275
I've still got friends.

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:49.834
How many families get telegrams
from former prime ministers...

01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:52.349
when somebody dies?

01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:55.358
I'm not forgotten.

01:25:55.480 --> 01:26:00.235
Betty Heslop lived
for her family.

01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:04.353
She was very happy about
her daughter Mariel's marriage...

01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:07.278
and attending the wedding
in Sydney...

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:11.518
was one of the highlights
of her life.

01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:15.589
Her life, during her last days
on earth...

01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:17.073
made me think of-

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:24.749
Mariel.

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:35.874
I'm sorry.

01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:57.353
I thought I was so different-

01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:01.473
a new person.

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:04.592
But I'm not.

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:07.154
I'm just the same as him.

01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:45.474
Heslop.

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:48.319
On The Beach Motel.

01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:50.556
One.

01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:09.555
I can't stay married to you, David.

01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:15.357
I've got to stop lying now.

01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:18.119
I tell so many lies.

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:20.549
One day I won't know
I'm doing it.

01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:27.355
I don't love you.

01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:35.154
I- I don't love you either,
but, uh-

01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:40.919
I don't know. I-I think I could like
having you around.

01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:47.155
I'II give you the money back.

01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:49.510
It's yours.

01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:31.151
Good luck in the games.

01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:35.357
You too.

01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:53.952
I don't understand it.

01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:59.153
Why'd she burn the back yard?

01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:03.757
We've got to stick together.

01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:06.553
You've got to help me
with the kids.

01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:09.114
What about Deidre?

01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:12.357
She'II lend a hand.
I don't think she's keen to marry me...

01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:14.471
now that livin' with the kids
has come into it.

01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:19.316
Someone's got to look after them.

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:23.115
And it has to be you, Dad.

01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:26.471
You owe me, Muriel.

01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:29.319
Now, this isn't all of it...

01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:32.273
but I'II pay the rest off
when I get back to Sydney and get a job.

01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:42.151
So you're not gonna help me out.
Is that it?

01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:46.114
You owe us, Dad.
We're not useless.

01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:50.153
We never were.
Now you're looking after the kids...

01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:52.748
and you're gonna tell them
they're not useless.

01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:01.558
How about that telegram
from Bob Hawke?

01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:05.157
How'd you get that?

01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:08.192
I phoned his office.

01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:10.276
I was nearly
in the state government.

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:12.994
Fourteen votes I needed.

01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:17.352
Nobody knew who'd won for three days
till the postal vote came in.

01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:20.358
For three days,
I was almost there.

01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:25.354
Couldn't win a chook raffle now.

01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:29.355
Resigned from the council.

01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:35.715
I'm unemployed.
Got to go on the dole.

01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:39.116
Imagine the faces
when I walk into that dole office.

01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:43.313
You reap what you sow.

01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:46.159
You'd think I'd have learned that
growin' up on a farm.

01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:50.749
You reap what you sow.

01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:58.957
Dad, the cricket's started.

01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:03.234
Hi, Joan.

01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:06.875
- Muriel's goin' back to Sydney.
- Are ya?

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.753
I thought you were stayin' here
with us.

01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:20.554
Keep in touch.

01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:23.274
Bye, Dad.

01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:31.758
Do you want me to open you
a can of beer?

01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:37.350
That would be lovely, Joanie.
With you in a sec.

01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:42.230
I'm giving it another chance
with Chook-

01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:44.635
as soon as he gets out
of the correction centre.

01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:47.877
They've accused him of raping
a Japanese tourist, which is ridiculous!

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.037
Chook hates the Japanese.

01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:54.709
We better fly.
We're meeting Rose Biggs for lunch.

01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:57.638
Rose Biggs?
Are you friends with her?

01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:00.957
Once we got to know her,
we found out she was just like us.

01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:02.832
But Rose Biggs sucked
your husband's cock.

01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:04.916
- Rhonda! - Oh,
she did. - I know.

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:07.235
But w-

01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:10.193
I sucked her husband's cock,
and it made me realize...

01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:12.629
we all make mistakes.

01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:15.115
Hi.

01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:18.437
- Mariel.
- Muriel.

01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:21.233
What a surprise!

01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:26.036
Rhonda, Mariel-
Muriel's come to visit you.

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:31.029
Actually, I've come to ask Rhonda
if she wants to come back to Sydney.

01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:36.154
I've got a taxi outside
and two plane tickets, if you want to.

01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:41.035
- What about your husband?
- We broke up.

01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:43.594
I knew it wouldn't last.

01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:47.156
What makes you think
I'd go anywhere with you?

01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:49.748
Because I'm your friend.

01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:54.553
Muriel, you can't come bargin' in here
without warning...

01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:57.672
trying to turn Rhonda
against the people who love her-

01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:01.793
against the people who were there
for her when she needed them.

01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:07.434
Yes, she can.

01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:10.711
Sorry, Mum. You know I love you,
but you drive me crazy.

01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:13.559
And you three-
what a bunch of cocksuckers.

01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:31.428
Who do you think you are
to call me that?

01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:34.677
I'm married. I'm beautiful!

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:41.430
You can dance

01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:43.710
You can jive

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:47.230
Having the time of your life

01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:50.432
Ooh, see that girl

01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:52.357
- Watch that scene
- See you, Mum.

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:55.950
Diggin' the dancing queen

01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:06.677
Friday night
and the lights are low

01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:10.713
Looking out for a place to go

01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:13.559
Mmm, where they play
the right music

01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:19.118
Getting in the swing
you come to look for a king

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:23.074
- Bye, street.
- Anybody could be that guy

01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:26.556
- Bye, mall!
- Night is young and the music's

01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:29.353
- Goodbye, beach!
- High

01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:31.630
- Goodbye, tourists!
- With a bit of rock music

01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:33.671
- Bye, plaza!
- Everything is fine

01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:35.756
- Goodbye, Surf Club!
- You're in the mood for a dance

01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:37.438
See you, surfies!

01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:40.120
- See ya, high rises!
- And when you get the chance

01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:42.151
Bye, Fun World!

01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:46.068
- Goodbye, Porpoise Spit!
- You are the dancing queen

01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:50.432
Young and sweet, only 17

01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:54.830
Dancing queen

01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:58.999
Feel the beat from the tambourine

01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:01.714
Oh, yeah

01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:04.115
You can dance

01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:06.435
You can jive

01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:09.836
Having the time of your life

01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:14.954
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene

01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:20.359
Diggin' the dancing queen

01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:33.831
You're a teaser
You turn 'em on

01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:38.431
Leave 'em burning
and then you're gone

01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:42.439
Looking out for another
Anyone will do

01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:45.358
You're in the mood for a dance

01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:51.038
And when you get the chance

01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:54.470
You are the dancing queen

01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:59.549
Young and sweet, only 17

01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:03.590
Dancing queen

01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:07.679
Feel the beat from the tambourine

01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:10.519
Oh, yeah

01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:12.790
You can dance

01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:15.195
You can jive

01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:18.630
Having the time of your life

01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:23.629
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene

01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:27.958
Diggin' the dancing queen

01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:37.551
Diggin' the dancing queen

01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:20.673
Can you hear the drums, Fernando

01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:27.156
I remember long ago
another starry night like this

01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:33.917
In the firelight, Fernando

01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:38.318
You were humming to yourself
and softly strumming your guitar

01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:41.876
I could hear the distant drums
and sounds of bugle calls

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:46.471
Were coming from afar

01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:51.196
They were closer now, Fernando

01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:56.155
Every hour, every minute
seemed to last eternally

01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:02.358
I was so afraid, Fernando

01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:06.871
We were young and full of life
and none of us prepared to die

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.470
And I'm not ashamed to say
the roar of guns and cannons

01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:14.513
Almost made me cry

01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:17.791
There was something in the air
that night

01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:22.994
The stars were bright, Fernando

01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:26.192
They were shining there
for you and me

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:30.359
For liberty, Fernando

01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:34.075
Though we never thought
that we could lose

01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:37.636
There's no regret

01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:40.911
If I had to do the same again

01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:44.953
I would, my friend, Fernando

01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:49.113
If I had to do the same again

01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:53.153
I would, my friend, Fernando

01:40:54.305 --> 01:41:00.330
