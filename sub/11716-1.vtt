00:03.211 --> 00:04.630
JENNIFER: Hey, Russell.

00:04.672 --> 00:05.881
Have you seen Adam?

00:05.923 --> 00:09.050
Adam, uh, six feet tall,
brown hair,

00:09.092 --> 00:10.135
lives with a chick who's

00:10.177 --> 00:11.887
w-w-way
too hot for him?

00:13.681 --> 00:15.015
All right,
even your compliments
are creepy.

00:16.141 --> 00:17.518
All right,
he's with Timmy,

00:17.559 --> 00:19.227
and they're
with a client for
the rest of the afternoon.

00:19.269 --> 00:22.063
Ugh. So coming down here
was a complete
waste of time.

00:22.105 --> 00:25.024
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Well, now, not necessarily.

00:27.110 --> 00:28.612
What are you
talking about?

00:28.654 --> 00:30.405
Well, you seem tense,
and, uh...

00:31.615 --> 00:33.241
I think I have just
the thing to relax you.

00:33.283 --> 00:35.118
(SCOFFS) Yeah, you wish.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.162
No, you do.

00:43.752 --> 00:46.087
(SCREAMING)

00:46.129 --> 00:47.422
Ah!

00:50.885 --> 00:52.594
What happened?
Did you have
a bad dream?

00:53.136 --> 00:54.513
No.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.682
I had the worst dream.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.642
I was having sex
with Russell.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.770
Oh, wow. Oh, my...

01:01.812 --> 01:03.605
Wow, honey,
that's awful.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.736
Yeah, Audrey's,
uh, not here, so...

01:50.778 --> 01:51.946
Well, here's the dealio.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.740
Uh, the Bertmans
are moving back,

01:54.782 --> 01:56.033
so I had to
find a new sublet.

01:57.743 --> 02:00.495
Oh, well, we'll sure
miss having you living
directly above us,

02:00.537 --> 02:02.205

of the night and such.

02:04.165 --> 02:06.418
Well, the problem is
there's a one-week gap

02:06.460 --> 02:07.962
between the Bertmans
moving back

02:08.003 --> 02:10.255
and my new place
being ready.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.299
So I guess what
I'm asking you,
Jeffrey, is...

02:14.009 --> 02:15.343
Can you help me
with my gap?

02:17.805 --> 02:21.058
Look, having you
live with us would
be a real treat.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.854
Unfortunately,
the guest room

02:25.896 --> 02:28.398
is, uh, piled high
with baby furniture,

02:28.440 --> 02:29.984
and, uh...

02:30.025 --> 02:31.693
Plus, uh, there's all
that asbestos.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.578
Oh. Hey, guys.
What's going on?

02:41.620 --> 02:43.163
Oh, I was just
asking Jeff

02:43.204 --> 02:44.957
if I could bunk
with you guys
for the week,

02:44.999 --> 02:46.416
but he told me
about the baby furniture

02:46.458 --> 02:48.127
in the guest room,
so...

02:48.167 --> 02:49.461
That stuff's not getting
delivered till next month.

02:51.797 --> 02:53.340
Aud...

02:53.381 --> 02:55.425
Uh, what about
that delivery that
I got yesterday?

02:58.470 --> 03:01.098
You mean the pizza
you ordered and
ate in the bathtub?

03:03.892 --> 03:05.644

She's got no boundaries.

03:45.100 --> 03:46.601
What about

03:48.478 --> 03:50.022
I'm sure she'll
put them in a kennel.

03:50.064 --> 03:51.106

04:29.144 --> 04:30.645
It's possible he made
an incorrect assumption.

04:33.899 --> 04:36.193
Whoa. Sweet table, yo.

04:36.235 --> 04:38.737
What's it doing here?
Ah, Mr. Rhodes.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.948
Well,
when Sullivan retired,

04:40.989 --> 04:42.616
there was a disagreement
between Mr. Dunbar and myself

04:42.657 --> 04:44.576
about what to do
with his office.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.120
What did Russell
want to do with it?

04:46.161 --> 04:47.537
He wanted to cover
the floor with mattresses

04:47.579 --> 04:48.663
and call it the boneyard.

04:51.166 --> 04:52.834
Well, he is the boss.

04:54.419 --> 04:56.713
Still, I convinced him
a ping-pong table

04:56.755 --> 04:59.091
could help bring
people together.
Hmm.

04:59.133 --> 05:01.093
Sounds like that
boneyard idea
might work too.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.015
We'll keep that
as a backup, sir.

05:08.267 --> 05:09.893
Look at this, huh?
Mm-hmm.

05:09.935 --> 05:12.187
Look at this,
tournament-grade surface,

05:13.563 --> 05:15.523
three-quarter inch top,
reinforced aluminum apron.

05:16.483 --> 05:17.525
Nice.

05:19.278 --> 05:22.530
Ah, Mr. Rhodes,
you play ping-pong.

05:22.572 --> 05:23.698
Well, Tim,
if you consider winning

05:23.740 --> 05:25.659

enrichment program

05:25.700 --> 05:27.619

whose parents couldn't
pick them up by 3:00

05:27.661 --> 05:29.496
ping-pong
championship playing...

05:31.331 --> 05:33.416
Then, yeah, I play.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.504
Oh. Not to boast, but,

05:37.545 --> 05:39.631
uh, I've been known
to stroke the balls
a bit in my day.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.049
Why would
I say it like that?

05:41.091 --> 05:42.217
I mean, really.

05:44.552 --> 05:46.054
So, what do you say, huh?
What do you say, Tim?

05:46.096 --> 05:47.430
Should we get
our pong on? Yeah.
Oh.

05:48.556 --> 05:50.058
Oh, cool.
A ping-pong table.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.559
Yeah, sorry, guys,

05:51.601 --> 05:54.229
but Timmy and
I are about to...
About to play, so...

05:54.271 --> 05:56.397
Perhaps we could
all play doubles.
Now, hold on.

06:00.359 --> 06:01.903
What pong championships
have you won?

06:03.362 --> 06:04.823
Um, none.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.449
Oh, man,
I can't do this.

06:07.575 --> 06:09.036
He's gonna
bring down my game.

06:09.077 --> 06:11.412
Mr. Rhodes, remember
this is about camaraderie.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.875
Hey, I'm Fred.
I work up in...
No names.

06:14.916 --> 06:15.876
Just grab a blade,
and let's do this.

06:22.132 --> 06:24.634
Hey, Aud, you almost ready,
or should I
make myself a drink?

06:24.676 --> 06:27.595
AUDREY: I'll just be
another sec.
Okay.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.848
Past experience
doesn't make me
question that at all.

06:34.519 --> 06:37.022
Well, I finally got
all my stuff unloaded.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.857
I am one sweaty dog.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.108
(LAUGHS) Woof.

06:43.444 --> 06:44.529

have that drink.

Mr. Sharp-dressed man.
(CHUCKLES)

06:50.451 --> 06:52.079

but now I'm bothered.

06:55.165 --> 06:56.291
Aud.

06:59.418 --> 07:00.795
Oh, Jeff,
I was also thinking

07:00.837 --> 07:02.881
about our morning
bathroom schedule.

07:02.923 --> 07:03.965
Ugh.

07:05.884 --> 07:08.929
Uh, I need to book
the commode
from 8:00 to 8:30.

07:08.970 --> 07:10.889
Oh, and I have
prescription toilet paper,

07:10.931 --> 07:12.974
so I think we need to keep
our rolls separate.

07:15.310 --> 07:17.312
I don't know
what is going on
with my plumbing.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.903
Oh, no, no.
Jeff, Jeff,
don't pour a drink.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.154
Come on,
you're gonna make us late.

07:26.196 --> 07:27.614
Me?

07:27.655 --> 07:29.532
I... I've been...

07:29.574 --> 07:30.658
Forget it.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.246
Actually, Audrey,
Jeff's been
ready for a while.

07:34.288 --> 07:36.248
He's been
waiting for you.

07:36.290 --> 07:37.707
Well, I was in...

07:38.917 --> 07:40.127
I had to change...

07:45.006 --> 07:46.674
All right.
All right.
It's my fault.

07:46.716 --> 07:47.675
I'm sorry.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.304
It's your fault,
and you're sorry?

07:51.888 --> 07:54.141
Yes.
I will try to be better
about managing my time.

07:54.182 --> 07:56.184
Come on,
let's go.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.145
Audrey actually said
it was her fault.
You heard that.

08:04.859 --> 08:06.611
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Here's
your rice pudding, sir.

08:06.653 --> 08:07.862
Yummy.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.283
Oh, did you
go through it?

08:11.325 --> 08:13.243
Yes, I removed
all the rice as
you requested.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.079
You know what?
They're just too pointy.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.167
Timmy.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.709
Timmy, we've got
a match coming up.

08:23.253 --> 08:24.338
We aren't you wearing
the outfit that I bought you?

08:26.840 --> 08:28.008
I'd rather not,
Mr. Rhodes.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.635
Hmm.

08:30.677 --> 08:33.013
What if your boss
ordered you to?

08:34.764 --> 08:36.433
Would he wear
the exact same
outfit as you?

08:38.352 --> 08:40.312
Yep.
Ordered.

08:46.401 --> 08:48.320
Oh. Hey.

08:48.362 --> 08:50.571
You will never guess
what happened last night.

08:50.613 --> 08:51.990
Hmm.
You know, I'm sorry,

08:52.032 --> 08:53.408
but I have to really focus
on my pudding right now.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.454
Jen had a sex dream
about you.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.256
Okay.

09:08.298 --> 09:09.799
I'm gonna need you
to speak very slowly.

09:11.676 --> 09:13.303
Start from the beginning,

09:13.345 --> 09:14.762
and remember,
no detail is unimportant.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.183
I can't. I can't.
I got to go stretch.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.476
Stretching can wait, sir!

09:21.353 --> 09:23.980
(LAUGHING)
I mean, Adam, buddy...

09:26.441 --> 09:27.984
Don't you think
you owe it to Jen

09:29.652 --> 09:30.945
to find out
the meaning of this dream?

09:32.531 --> 09:34.699
As Freud
so eloquently put,

09:34.741 --> 09:36.784
"Dreams are
the guardians of sleep."
Hmm.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.205
Now, was I riding her
like a bull in a rodeo?

09:43.417 --> 09:44.751
I... I don't know.

09:44.792 --> 09:46.044
I just know
she woke up screaming.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.128
Screaming in ecstasy.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.923
Yes!

09:49.964 --> 09:51.341
Dream Russell knows
what the ladies like.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.055
Hi.
BOTH: Hey, honey.

09:58.723 --> 09:59.807
Ugh.

10:01.642 --> 10:02.977
Hey, could you,
uh, take these papers

10:03.019 --> 10:04.438
down to the recycling
in the basement, please?

10:04.479 --> 10:05.813
I was gonna have a beer.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.607
Yeah, it'll just
take a second.

10:07.648 --> 10:10.360
Audrey, your fella
just had a long day at work.

10:10.402 --> 10:11.861
How about a little
how do you do

10:11.903 --> 10:13.488
before you give him
the old honey do?

10:15.532 --> 10:16.575
Fine.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.577
I'll take them.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.497
I work too, you know.

10:23.748 --> 10:24.749
You go, girl.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.380
(DOOR CLOSES)

10:35.594 --> 10:38.305
So, you actually like
having Liz live with you?

10:38.346 --> 10:41.600
Like it? Last night
was the best night
of my life.

10:45.686 --> 10:47.981
Oh, Jeff, that stuff
is terrible for you.

10:48.022 --> 10:49.483
I thought we agreed
to eat healthier.

10:49.524 --> 10:50.942
LIZ: If you want Jeff
to eat better,

10:50.984 --> 10:52.777
you're gonna have to cook
more and complain less.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.412
Oh, we really need
a new dining-room set.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.373
Well, you don't need one.
You want one.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.590
Come on, Jeff,
I want to watch
The Amazing Race.

11:14.549 --> 11:15.674
Hey, it's not his fault

11:15.716 --> 11:16.968
the game went
into extra innings.

11:20.514 --> 11:21.389
RUSSELL: Dude.

11:23.308 --> 11:26.019
I know we joke around a lot,
but seriously,
congratulations.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.437
Yeah, yeah. No.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.230
Yeah, you deserve it.
You deserve it.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.107
That's not all.

11:31.149 --> 11:32.817
Uh, Liz got Audrey
to say,

11:32.859 --> 11:34.068
and I quote,

11:35.069 --> 11:36.237
"I'm sorry."
Oh!

11:38.406 --> 11:40.325
At first,
the words didn't register.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.537
I hadn't heard them
in over 15 years.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.248
You sure
it wasn't a dream?

11:47.290 --> 11:49.167
Like the one
where I boned
this dude's fiancee?

11:52.920 --> 11:54.214
Come on.

11:58.009 --> 11:59.594
Who knew
there could be
a benefit to Liz?

12:02.305 --> 12:03.515
You know,
it's really too bad

12:03.557 --> 12:05.141
that you guys need
a third person.

12:05.183 --> 12:07.060
Jen and I just
work things out together.

12:07.101 --> 12:09.062
Oh, so you
both decided

12:09.103 --> 12:10.564
that she would
bang Russell
in her dreams.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.441
Oh-ho-ho.

12:13.483 --> 12:14.942
Oh.

12:14.984 --> 12:15.985
(LAUGHS)

12:19.030 --> 12:20.948
All right,
match point.

12:25.662 --> 12:26.745
Oh!

12:28.415 --> 12:30.749
Oh, yeah! I hope you losers
enjoy the taste of losing.

12:30.791 --> 12:31.959
Losers!

12:33.294 --> 12:35.046
Let's get out of here.
Oh, "Let's get out of here."

12:35.088 --> 12:36.755
Fine, you know what?
Skedaddle.

12:36.797 --> 12:38.132
Get out of here...
Stinking up the joint.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.345
Right this way, milady.
Oh, come on.

12:42.387 --> 12:44.138
Who put a ping-pong table
in the boneyard?

12:49.143 --> 12:51.396
All right.
Who's next?

12:51.438 --> 12:53.314
Huh?
Well, um...

12:57.193 --> 12:58.528
It seems that
nobody else wants to play.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.321
Oh, well.
Mr. Rhodes...

13:00.363 --> 13:02.657
Have we let our
competitiveness
get the better of us?

13:02.699 --> 13:04.117
I only know one speed,
Timmy, okay?

13:04.158 --> 13:05.326
Supersonic.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.871
Perhaps we should go
offer them an apology.

13:08.913 --> 13:10.749
(SIGHS)

13:10.789 --> 13:11.832
All right,
maybe you're right.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.794
Hey, when did we get
a ping-pong table?

13:15.836 --> 13:17.422
Oh, it's like that,
is it? Let's go.

13:18.881 --> 13:20.007
Okay, this will be fun.

13:22.093 --> 13:23.637
Chivalry dictates
that the ladies
serve first.

13:27.682 --> 13:28.683
Oh!

13:32.019 --> 13:33.605
(MUFFLED GROANING)

13:33.647 --> 13:34.689
How's that feel,
four-eyes?

13:35.356 --> 13:36.775
Huh?

13:36.815 --> 13:37.816
Or should I say three-eyes?

13:37.858 --> 13:38.985
Peace!

13:40.612 --> 13:42.530
All right,
don't slip on your tears.
Next!

13:48.453 --> 13:49.496
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

13:55.418 --> 13:57.253
Good morning,
sweet Jennifer.

13:57.295 --> 13:59.213
Ugh.
What are you doing here?

13:59.255 --> 14:02.049
You tell me.
This is your dream.

14:02.676 --> 14:05.261
Ooh-ooh-ooh!

14:05.303 --> 14:06.680
I can't believe Adam
told you about that.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.098
I know a way you can...

14:09.848 --> 14:10.891
Get back at him.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.396
Ugh. Fine.

14:17.064 --> 14:18.566
Let's do this.

14:18.608 --> 14:19.942
Seriously?

14:19.984 --> 14:21.235
Seriously.

14:23.697 --> 14:24.989
(SCREAMING)

14:28.993 --> 14:30.745
I have to get Russell
out of my head.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.163
Adam, we have to have
sex right now.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.541
No. Sorry, hon.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.417
Look, I got to rest up
for pong tomorrow.
Ugh.

14:37.794 --> 14:40.004
No. It wasn't a question.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.345
(DEEP SIGH)
Hey, you know,
I've been thinking.

14:48.847 --> 14:50.931
I shouldn't have forced you
to let Liz move in here.

14:51.683 --> 14:52.767
I was wrong to do that.

14:53.601 --> 14:54.561
What? What's that?

14:55.186 --> 14:56.437
I was wrong.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.566
It's like angels singing.

15:01.776 --> 15:03.737
If you want,
you can ask her
to go to a hotel.

15:05.697 --> 15:08.115
No, you were right.
Friends help friends.

15:08.157 --> 15:09.784
It's called being a person.

15:09.826 --> 15:10.785
You taught me that.

15:12.787 --> 15:13.830
Okay, let's cut the crap.

15:15.206 --> 15:16.708
The only reason
you like Liz staying here

15:16.750 --> 15:18.084
is 'cause she's always
taking your side.

15:18.125 --> 15:19.586
Is she?
I hadn't noticed.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.337
I mean, I had noticed

15:21.379 --> 15:22.963
that she's a very
levelheaded gal,

15:23.005 --> 15:26.342
crusader
of truth and justice.
Oh, come on.

15:26.384 --> 15:29.262
I'm turning off this light,
so I don't have to look
at that giant muggy smile.

15:31.639 --> 15:32.973
Yeah,
but even in the dark...

15:34.183 --> 15:35.268
You know it's there.

15:36.352 --> 15:37.478
Ow!

15:38.813 --> 15:39.647
It's still there.

15:47.029 --> 15:48.573
Really, you...
You don't need
to apologize.

15:48.615 --> 15:49.741
I know. I just...

15:49.783 --> 15:51.242
I tried to tell her no sex,

15:51.284 --> 15:52.326
but she just
wouldn't listen.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.538
Yes, as you told me
last night,

15:55.580 --> 15:57.164
when you texted me
from atop your fiancee.

16:01.419 --> 16:02.837
Huh. That's curious.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.217
What do you guys want?

16:08.259 --> 16:09.469
What do you think
we want, huh?

16:09.510 --> 16:11.137
To wipe the court
with you, ass-face.

16:12.764 --> 16:14.307
Well, that's not
gonna happen.

16:14.348 --> 16:15.850
You guys are banned.

16:15.892 --> 16:17.351
We just wanted
to have some fun
during our lunch hour,

16:17.393 --> 16:19.437
but you had to start
bullying everyone.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.105
Yeah, because I only
know one speed, guy...

16:21.147 --> 16:22.315
Super...

16:24.066 --> 16:25.192
Sonic.

16:26.861 --> 16:28.863
Actually, this might be
a good thing, Mr. Rhodes.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.197
(PEOPLE CHEERING)
I mean,
listen to them in there.

16:32.074 --> 16:33.701
The table was supposed
to bring people together,

16:33.743 --> 16:35.703
and it appears it has.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.664
It's brought them together
in their hatred of us.

16:41.292 --> 16:42.543
Then you're welcome.

16:44.587 --> 16:46.798
I mean,
if I hadn't been
so dominant,

16:46.840 --> 16:47.882
people wouldn't
have hated us so much.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.845
Well, it was clearly
my skill that
carried our team

16:51.886 --> 16:53.721
and, thus,
led to the extraordinary
level of hatred.

16:53.763 --> 16:54.889
Oh, really?
Oh, I'm glad
you think so.

16:54.931 --> 16:56.015
I don't think it.

16:56.599 --> 16:57.725
I know it.

16:59.894 --> 17:00.854
We hate you both equally.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.481
(DOOR CLOSES)

17:03.523 --> 17:04.440
Well, there you have it.

17:04.482 --> 17:05.399
We make a good team.

17:07.443 --> 17:08.903
Hey, by the way,
you owe me
$300 for the outfit.

17:14.534 --> 17:15.660
Ugh.

(CATS MEOWING)

17:37.056 --> 17:38.683
Hi, honey.
How was your day?

17:39.726 --> 17:41.769
What the hell's
going on here?

17:41.811 --> 17:44.689
Well, last night
you made
some excellent points.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.148
By not letting Liz
keep her cats here,

17:46.190 --> 17:47.441
I was not being
a good friend.

17:49.027 --> 17:50.110
Strong move.

17:53.031 --> 17:55.115
Ah, there's the
hombre de la casa.

17:56.158 --> 17:58.578
Thanks for letting
my brood stay here.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.955
Their time in the kennel
really threw off
their potty habits,

18:00.997 --> 18:02.373
but don't worry.
They're getting closer

18:02.415 --> 18:04.792
to the litter box
every time.

18:04.834 --> 18:07.003
Oh, no.
Cotton, don't you make
a liar out of me.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.591
Oh, that's okay,
right, Jeff?

18:11.632 --> 18:13.718
Liz, did Audrey tell you
how we're visiting
her parents

18:13.760 --> 18:15.135
for a week,

18:15.177 --> 18:18.180
after we had already
agreed on just
a long weekend?

18:18.222 --> 18:19.891
Audrey, you can't make
changes like that

18:19.933 --> 18:20.934
without looping
your hubby in.

18:21.350 --> 18:22.727
Good point.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.771
Tell Jeff your unfortunate
gynecologist story.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.357
Well, Jeffery,
as you may
or may not know,

18:28.399 --> 18:29.609
I have a tilted cervix.

18:31.318 --> 18:33.487
Needless to say,
you can't use
a regular speculum.

18:34.321 --> 18:35.656
You don't say.

18:35.698 --> 18:37.241
When I ask
Audrey for sex,

18:37.283 --> 18:39.118
a lot of times
she turns me down.
Go.

18:40.536 --> 18:42.747
Audrey, you need to have
your hormones checked

18:42.789 --> 18:43.957
if you're turning
down this stud.

18:43.998 --> 18:45.541
Will do.
Tell Jeff your cat's visit

18:45.583 --> 18:47.251
to the vet story.
Oh.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.003
Well, normally,
anal sacs

18:49.045 --> 18:50.922
are emptied
by rectal pressure

18:50.964 --> 18:53.049
when the cat defecates.

18:53.091 --> 18:56.010
Now, in the case of Pickles,
you have to do it manually.

18:56.052 --> 18:59.221
And this is not
unmessy or odorless.

18:59.263 --> 19:01.808
Audrey buys
tons of crap
we don't need.

19:01.849 --> 19:03.142

need it, that's a waste...

what this is all about?

told you're wrong.

have never
seen a situation

tried to exploit.

19:15.613 --> 19:17.698
I see an opportunity.
I seize it.

to live together.

Yeah, I guess I chose
to win a few battles

instead of thinking
about the war.

being the war?

19:53.776 --> 19:54.902
Obviously.

hurt a little bit.
