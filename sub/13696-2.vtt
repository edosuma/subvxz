00:46.362 --> 00:49.740
Excuse me, do you know
the way to Glenbogle?

00:49.823 --> 00:52.368
Know it?
I practically run the place!

01:31.740 --> 01:34.285
(LOUD MUSIC PLAYING)

01:49.633 --> 01:51.969
Hey, Penelope Pitstop,
are you trying to kill us?

01:53.637 --> 01:54.722
Amy!

01:54.805 --> 01:56.223
(LAUGHING)

01:56.307 --> 01:58.309
Amy.

01:58.392 --> 02:01.854
This gorgeous girl is my
goddaughter, Amy McDougal.

02:03.230 --> 02:04.440
(CHUCKLES)

02:09.652 --> 02:11.780
GOLLY: Are you getting
hungry, wee man?

02:14.158 --> 02:16.452
Where's that big sister
of yours got to?

02:17.578 --> 02:19.705
Good morning.

02:19.788 --> 02:22.416
You let me do
the talking here, son.

02:22.499 --> 02:26.879
It's a fine one at that.
But, then again,
they're all fine nowadays.

02:27.671 --> 02:29.213
That's freedom for you.

02:29.298 --> 02:31.508
-So they let you out?
-Don't look so worried.

02:31.592 --> 02:34.720
I've forgiven you. In fact,
you all did me a favour.

02:34.803 --> 02:37.932
You're looking at
a rehabilitated man.

02:38.015 --> 02:40.267
You've been busy, too, I see.
Coochy, coochy, coo.

02:40.351 --> 02:42.811
He doesn't speak gibberish.

02:42.895 --> 02:46.023
-What do you want?
-I've a bit of business
with the laird.

02:47.608 --> 02:49.568
Come on.

02:49.652 --> 02:51.570
PAUL: Why didn't you tell us
you were coming?
AMY: I did.

02:51.654 --> 02:53.656
I spoke to someone
at the house and they said
it was fine.

02:53.739 --> 02:55.032
ALL: Donald!

02:55.115 --> 02:57.076
No harm done, I'm here now.

02:57.159 --> 03:00.246
-I could murder a drink.
-Not this early, you couldn't.

03:00.329 --> 03:02.289
-Coffee, then?
-Yeah, we can manage that.

03:02.373 --> 03:04.291
Hey, what about school?

03:04.375 --> 03:06.210
-I've left.
-JESS: Er, Paul.

03:12.841 --> 03:14.343
Look, Amy,
I've got to deal with this.

03:14.426 --> 03:18.055
Just ask Ewan if there's
anything you need,
within reason.

03:21.058 --> 03:23.102
-Is this all your stuff?
-Yeah.

03:23.185 --> 03:24.687
Travel light,
it's the only way.

03:29.400 --> 03:32.611
He can't just come marching in
here as if he owns the place.

03:32.695 --> 03:34.780
Let Paul deal with it.

03:34.863 --> 03:37.658
Cameron needs a bottle
and a lie down.

03:38.492 --> 03:39.952
What's he up to?

03:40.035 --> 03:43.038
Come on, lass,
what's more important?

03:43.122 --> 03:46.792
Glowering at Tam Cooper, or
seeing the wee man all right?

03:46.875 --> 03:48.210
Huh? Come on.

03:50.421 --> 03:53.173
My mother died
while I was away.

03:53.257 --> 03:57.886
-I'm sorry to hear that.
-Aye, well, her croft passes
onto me.

03:57.970 --> 04:00.639
I'm here to buy it
and the five acres
of land it stands on.

04:00.723 --> 04:01.974
(SNORTING)

04:03.559 --> 04:05.311
It's my right, is it not?

04:06.979 --> 04:08.981
It is.

04:09.064 --> 04:12.151
You'll have to forgive us
if we don't see you
as the crofting type.

04:13.736 --> 04:16.029
I've surprised myself.

04:16.113 --> 04:19.408
I'd like to confirm the land
boundaries with you, Laird.

04:19.491 --> 04:21.744
You'll have
to pay for it first.

04:21.827 --> 04:23.996
Why don't you come back
when you've got
all the relevant documents

04:24.079 --> 04:26.331
and we'll take it from there.

04:26.415 --> 04:29.334
You'll find these
are all in order.

04:30.836 --> 04:32.671
I hope you don't mind.

04:35.925 --> 04:37.718
I prefer cash.

04:37.801 --> 04:41.180
-I wonder why.
-I'll give you some time
to look things over.

04:42.306 --> 04:44.433
If you'll check the map,

04:44.516 --> 04:47.770
I wouldn't want
to be laying claim to any bits
I wasn't entitled to.

05:02.660 --> 05:04.286
Thanks.

05:04.370 --> 05:06.288
Sally, come here.

05:11.919 --> 05:13.420
Hello?

05:15.798 --> 05:16.924
Hello?

05:18.384 --> 05:19.802
Is there anyone in?

05:22.179 --> 05:25.057
Well, well.
Look who we've got here.

05:25.140 --> 05:26.433
Hi, Tam. How are you?

05:26.517 --> 05:29.436
All the better
for seeing a friendly face.

05:29.520 --> 05:32.773
Nice to know there's one of us
on the inside keeping an eye
on things.

05:34.233 --> 05:35.734
Be seeing you.

05:42.116 --> 05:43.325
(CLICKING)

05:45.578 --> 05:49.748
No matter how far you travel,
there's no place
like Scotland.

05:49.832 --> 05:51.292
You travel a lot?

05:51.375 --> 05:54.336
Aye, my dad's in the army
so he gets posted all over.

05:54.420 --> 05:58.215
He's been on active service
for a while, so I've
been stuck at boarding school.

05:58.299 --> 05:59.758
Nightmare.

06:03.846 --> 06:05.806
Want to help me test the bed?

06:07.057 --> 06:08.183
Well, I...

06:11.520 --> 06:13.355
I wouldn't do that.

06:14.231 --> 06:15.357
(WOOD CRACKING)

06:17.192 --> 06:19.612
Don't look so worried.
Paul'll have someone
who can fix it.

06:19.695 --> 06:21.322
Aye, he's called Ewan.

06:27.912 --> 06:29.872
-Kilwillie!
-Molly!

06:29.955 --> 06:31.123
It can't be.

06:31.206 --> 06:33.876
It is and it's
wonderful to see you.

06:33.959 --> 06:37.922
How was New York?
Why didn't you let me know
you were back?

06:38.005 --> 06:41.175
Oh, look at you!
Have you been eating enough?

06:41.258 --> 06:43.719
Kilwillie, there you are.

06:43.802 --> 06:46.305
-We really don't
have time to waste.
-This is Molly.

06:48.182 --> 06:50.851
Excuse us, we have a
previous appointment.

06:50.935 --> 06:52.770
No, no, this is Hector's wife.

06:52.853 --> 06:55.856
This is Molly MacDonald
of Glenbogle.

06:55.940 --> 06:58.859
And my dearest,
dearest friend.

07:01.904 --> 07:03.781
-Okay. Thank you.
-(DOOR OPENS)

07:06.408 --> 07:10.537
Our lawyers have been served
with the same papers.
Everything's in order.

07:10.621 --> 07:12.998
That's ridiculous.

07:13.082 --> 07:15.960
And it isn't right,
the man's a convicted poacher.

07:16.043 --> 07:18.128
I can't choose who I sell to.

07:18.212 --> 07:20.089
He has an absolute right
to buy.

07:21.465 --> 07:23.175
I'd love to know where
he got his money from.

07:23.259 --> 07:25.135
My dear mother. Rest her soul.

07:26.428 --> 07:27.596
So, Laird?

07:29.848 --> 07:32.851
Congratulations,
you've got yourself some land.

07:35.271 --> 07:36.939
A fine stretch
of river there, too.

07:37.022 --> 07:40.317
The estate still owns the
salmon fishing rights, mind.

07:40.401 --> 07:43.028
-I'll respect that, of course.
-You make sure you do.

07:44.405 --> 07:47.658
I look forward to us
being good neighbours.

07:47.741 --> 07:49.827
Pleasure doing business.

07:49.910 --> 07:54.123
Who'd have thought it, eh?
Tam Cooper, land owner.

07:54.206 --> 07:57.459
You won't need to worry
about me poaching
any more of your deer.

08:05.509 --> 08:06.802
You are kind.

08:06.885 --> 08:10.764
My pleasure.
Any friend of Kilwillie's.

08:10.848 --> 08:13.517
I just knew you two
were going to get on.

08:23.652 --> 08:25.738
What's the matter with me?

08:25.821 --> 08:30.326
First I burn down your
croft and then I leave you
camping in the driveway.

08:30.409 --> 08:33.037
Oh, well. You've certainly got
your own way of doing things.

08:33.120 --> 08:34.871
-Here's your mail.
-Oh.

08:34.955 --> 08:37.791
A postcard from Donald
and no bills.

08:37.875 --> 08:39.876
Must be a first.

08:39.960 --> 08:44.298
Look, I'm really glad you
decided to take
me up on my offer.

08:44.381 --> 08:47.134
I didn't have
much choice, did I?

08:49.762 --> 08:53.057
I'm sure we'll all get on
like a house on fire.
(CHUCKLING)

08:55.726 --> 08:57.602
Maybe not.

08:57.686 --> 09:02.441
Okay, this one is
south facing, I think.

09:02.524 --> 09:04.401
It doesn't seem to be
facing anywhere.

09:07.363 --> 09:09.657
Sorry. This one.

09:14.119 --> 09:16.330
This is just for me?

09:16.413 --> 09:18.582
You didn't think you'd
have to share, did you?

09:18.666 --> 09:21.126
No wonder you thought twice
about coming.

09:21.210 --> 09:22.586
Right, uh...

09:23.504 --> 09:25.339
Yell if you need anything.

(DOOR CLOSING)

09:34.682 --> 09:37.685

-Having fun?

09:37.768 --> 09:39.687
Yeah, this is great.

09:39.770 --> 09:42.690
I didn't know you were minted.

09:42.773 --> 09:45.943
-Will you play me?
-No, I can't, not just now.
Maybe later.

09:46.026 --> 09:48.487
I'd better ring your dad,
let him know
you arrived safely.

09:48.571 --> 09:50.239
You can't.

09:50.322 --> 09:53.909
-He's in a war zone. Remember?
-When did you last hear
from him?

09:53.993 --> 09:55.828
I get messages every so often.

09:58.622 --> 10:01.250
-I'm sorry it's been so long.
-Four years.

10:01.917 --> 10:04.253
Four?

10:04.336 --> 10:06.672
-That means you must be...
-18.

10:06.755 --> 10:08.465
I forgot your 18th birthday.

10:09.550 --> 10:12.094
Amy, I'm so sorry. Really.

10:12.177 --> 10:13.721
I'll make it up
to you, I promise.

10:13.804 --> 10:16.640
-How?
-We'll have a party.

10:16.724 --> 10:18.225
Tonight?

10:18.309 --> 10:21.896
-Yeah, why not.
-Sound. You do the food
and I'll do the drink.

10:21.979 --> 10:23.147
It's a deal.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

10:34.491 --> 10:37.244
Hello, is that
Glenbogle off-licence?

10:37.328 --> 10:39.121
Do you sell vodka jellies?

10:40.039 --> 10:42.041
Cool. Can I order 100, please?

10:50.341 --> 10:53.761
-I love shellfish.
-Hey, they're for the lunches.

10:53.844 --> 10:55.763
Can't I have mine now?
I'm starving.

10:55.846 --> 10:58.515
They're not for us,
they're for the fishing party.

10:58.599 --> 11:01.602
-This is
a working estate, Amy.
-Oh.

11:01.685 --> 11:04.688
Look, I'll make you a sandwich
if you load the lunches
into the car.

11:04.772 --> 11:05.856
Okay.

11:08.692 --> 11:10.736
How fast is your car?

11:10.819 --> 11:14.156
How fast? I'm entering it
in a banger rally
in a couple of weeks.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.616
You're gonna race in it?

11:15.699 --> 11:17.534
And win,
if I can persuade Jess
or Zoe to navigate.

11:22.206 --> 11:23.749
Now, are you helping or not?

All loaded up.

11:47.231 --> 11:50.317
-Thanks.
-I could navigate for you,
if you like.

11:50.401 --> 11:52.778
-I've done orienteering.
-You can map-read?

11:52.861 --> 11:56.907
-Yeah, so let's do it.
-What... I've got to clear up.

11:56.991 --> 12:00.869
Don't be such a wimp,
the dishes will keep. Come on.

for one circuit.

That was brilliant.
You've done this before.

Yeah, I wanted
to surprise you.

-Amy was amazing.

rally technique
my dad taught me.

-Impressive or what?
-Very.

the lunches are ready

to careen around
in that thing.

-They're in
the back of the landy.
-Glad to hear it.

13:23.911 --> 13:25.371
Ewan,
they're not in the landy.

put them in your car.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.585
How could you think that?

13:31.669 --> 13:34.630
It is not Amy's job to
pack the lunches, Ewan.

13:44.807 --> 13:47.101
Right, you've got
15 minutes
to sort this lot out.

13:47.184 --> 13:49.228

or it's coming off your wages.

to put my things.
-Oh, sure.

Help yourself to
anything you need.

I want you to treat this place
as your home
while you're here.

Oh, you don't want me
doing that.

these lunches down to the hut.

-Hiya.

My brains, his charm...
How can we fail?

28:58.178 --> 28:59.763
(LAUGHING)

28:59.847 --> 29:02.641
(SCOFFING) How indeed.

29:02.725 --> 29:07.146
That's a delightful scarf
you're wearing, Molly.

29:07.229 --> 29:10.524
I'm afraid I'm not
brave enough
to risk that colour.

29:10.608 --> 29:12.818
KILWILLIE:
Oh, but you should, my dear.

29:12.902 --> 29:14.612
Any colour would suit you.

29:14.695 --> 29:18.032
(GIGGLING)
Thank you, Kilwillie.

29:18.115 --> 29:20.826
Isn't he so gallant?

29:24.538 --> 29:26.290
How did we get through
this much venison?

29:26.373 --> 29:29.460
And who ordered all this stuff
from the off-licence?

29:29.543 --> 29:33.255
-I'm not sure.
-That's not good enough, Ewan.
You're paid to be sure.

29:33.881 --> 29:35.883
I'm sorry, boss.

29:35.966 --> 29:39.553
Just... Just make sure
you keep track of everything
from now on, all right?

29:46.226 --> 29:47.728
Thanks for not grassing me up.

29:47.811 --> 29:50.397
-It's against my religion.
-I'll make it up to you.

29:50.481 --> 29:54.151
-Please don't.
-Me, you and Jess are going
out for a drink. My treat.

29:57.404 --> 30:00.074
MOLLY: Can I ask you
something, Kilwillie?
KILWILLIE: Hmm?

30:00.157 --> 30:03.494
Do you think you'll be
happy working with Edith?

30:03.577 --> 30:07.665
KILWILLIE: Why, of course,
she's very good at her job.

30:07.748 --> 30:11.669
-I think she's set her sights
on a lot more than the job.
-What do you mean?

30:12.419 --> 30:14.004
You, Kilwillie.

30:14.922 --> 30:17.007
(LAUGHING)

30:17.091 --> 30:22.346
You think a woman like her
would be interested in a
crusty old bachelor like me?

30:24.014 --> 30:27.226
Oh, you flatter me, Molly.

30:27.309 --> 30:31.188
No, no. Edith had her heart
broken a year ago

30:31.272 --> 30:34.483
when her husband ran off
with another woman.

30:34.567 --> 30:38.862
She doesn't think
she'll ever be able
to trust a man again.

30:42.825 --> 30:45.828
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

30:45.911 --> 30:49.373
Jess, sorry
for messing up earlier.

30:49.456 --> 30:53.460
That's all right.
Sorry for having a go.

30:53.544 --> 30:57.089
Lads, this is Amy. Amy, this
is my pals, and you know Jess.

30:57.172 --> 31:00.301
AMY:
I wasn't expecting so much
talent in such a wee place.

31:00.384 --> 31:03.220
-So, what are you having?
I'm buying.
-Hiya.

31:03.304 --> 31:05.472
What age is she? 15?

31:05.556 --> 31:07.182
She's 18, actually.

31:07.266 --> 31:08.892
Oh, is that what she told you?

31:08.976 --> 31:10.728
No, that's what
the boss told me.

31:10.811 --> 31:12.605
She's his goddaughter.

31:12.688 --> 31:14.523
Well, she doesn't look it.

31:14.607 --> 31:15.858
(ALL LAUGHING)

31:17.026 --> 31:18.819
Aye, well, she'd surprise you.

31:18.903 --> 31:21.280
Took nearly a minute off
my time while navigating.

31:21.363 --> 31:22.948
Oh, so you're still
in a huff with me

31:23.032 --> 31:25.367
for not doing the map-reading
for your stupid rally?

31:25.451 --> 31:28.120
It's not a stupid rally
and I don't care
if you map-read or not.

31:28.203 --> 31:29.580
Plenty of other people
are up for it.

31:29.663 --> 31:31.749
-Like who?
-Amy, for one.

31:37.171 --> 31:40.341
Tam Cooper's antics have
scuppered us for the moment.

31:40.424 --> 31:42.760
But with your help,

31:42.843 --> 31:44.261
I think we can
turn that around.

31:44.345 --> 31:46.555
There's always some excuse.

31:46.639 --> 31:49.934
Look, if I'm willing to listen
to the laird after
he burned my house down,

31:50.017 --> 31:52.436
then I'd hope the rest of you
would at least
give him a chance.

31:52.519 --> 31:55.648
-(CROWD LIGHTLY LAUGHING)
-Aye, right enough.

31:55.731 --> 31:58.234
And I'd like
to take this opportunity
to publicly thank Iona

31:58.317 --> 32:01.904
for accepting my offer
of board and lodging
rather than suing me.

32:01.987 --> 32:03.489
(CROWD LAUGHING)

32:03.572 --> 32:06.492
So, Laird, are you going
to invite us all up
to the Big House

32:06.575 --> 32:08.369
until you can fix up
our crofts?

32:08.452 --> 32:11.288
(ALL LAUGHING)

32:11.372 --> 32:14.124
Well, I'm hoping
that the dubious prospect
of that will be enough

32:14.208 --> 32:16.043
to persuade you all
to help me.

32:18.879 --> 32:20.214
So, are you with me?

32:22.341 --> 32:26.512
-Aye, Laird, we're with you.
-PAUL: Great.

32:26.595 --> 32:30.516
We're gonna need hammers,
saws, chisels and as many
bodies as possible.

32:33.602 --> 32:35.354
EDITH: He's just the way
I like 'em.

32:35.437 --> 32:39.775
Pompous, lonely and rich.
(LAUGHING)

32:39.858 --> 32:44.280
Count on it. When I come back
to New York,
it will be as Lady Kilwillie.

32:45.781 --> 32:46.991
Molly?

32:47.866 --> 32:49.118
Edith?

32:50.869 --> 32:53.664
Oh, there you are.

32:53.747 --> 32:57.751
Um, right, so you'll cancel
that first order? Thank you.

32:59.670 --> 33:01.130

for a few days. Amy, Zoe.

33:12.683 --> 33:14.768
Hi, Zoe, nice to meet you.

33:14.852 --> 33:17.897
You too.
I'm Ewan's girlfriend.

33:17.980 --> 33:21.150
Oh, I didn't know
he had a girlfriend.

33:22.026 --> 33:23.485
Well, you do now.

33:33.454 --> 33:36.040
-There you go.
-Thank you.

33:36.123 --> 33:39.209
Hold on. There's one
final secret ingredient.

33:40.252 --> 33:41.670
Close your eyes.

33:47.885 --> 33:49.386
Okay.

33:53.140 --> 33:54.558
Good?

33:54.642 --> 33:56.936
Very good.

33:57.019 --> 33:59.563
Well, thanks for your support
this evening.

33:59.647 --> 34:00.898
We made a good team.

You're really lucky.
Ewan's nice.

34:42.106 --> 34:43.274
It's not luck.

34:44.149 --> 34:45.442
Need a hand with these?

34:45.525 --> 34:47.277
Yeah, thanks.

34:50.322 --> 34:53.074
I finish in an hour.
You can walk me home.

34:53.158 --> 34:54.994
I can't, I have to take Amy.

34:55.077 --> 34:57.997
-(SCOFFING)
-It's work, Zoe.
She's the boss' goddaughter.

34:58.080 --> 34:59.999
You're not a serf, Ewan.

35:01.208 --> 35:04.378
I'll come back after
I've got her home. Okay?

35:04.795 --> 35:06.505
Okay.

35:06.589 --> 35:09.383
-But if you don't...
-Yeah?

35:09.466 --> 35:11.635
-You're chucked.
-What?

35:12.344 --> 35:13.721
You heard.

-(GASPING)
-Hi. It's safer to knock.

35:51.841 --> 35:53.344
Shall I walk you home?

35:53.426 --> 35:56.054
Yeah. Please.

35:56.138 --> 35:59.098
I find it easier
to count the doors.

35:59.182 --> 36:02.268
I'll try that.
Or I'll leave a trail
of bread.

36:02.353 --> 36:03.646
That way.

36:05.856 --> 36:07.399
Right. We're all standing
at the bar.

to an arm-wrestling match.

season ticket.

-She tanked him. She hasn't
missed a game since.

(LAUGHING)

36:16.659 --> 36:18.118
Right, I better be going.

36:19.203 --> 36:20.913
I'd tank you.

36:20.995 --> 36:23.540
-Are you having a laugh?
-What, are you scared
or something?

36:26.377 --> 36:28.420
I suppose I've got
a couple of seconds.

36:33.550 --> 36:34.802
Good idea.

-Well, good night, then.
-Good night.

to know that however
tight things get,

sure your croft
is properly restored.

-Sleep well.

my back in.
-You all right?

if you can't concentrate.

-Promise?

We can start by
clearing away the stones.

and pick up Ewan's things.

I might have known.

40:02.217 --> 40:04.011
Amy, are you okay?

40:04.094 --> 40:08.474
I assume you're
Paul MacDonald. We found
your address in Amy's locker.

40:08.557 --> 40:10.100
Yes, I am, but...

40:10.184 --> 40:12.227
I've been worried sick.

40:12.311 --> 40:15.522
When a 16-year-old girl
runs away, you can't help
but fear the worst.

40:15.606 --> 40:18.234
-Sixteen?
-Sorry, just a minute.
Who are you?

40:18.317 --> 40:22.279
-Edward Green,
Amy's headmaster.
-You're still at school?

40:27.034 --> 40:31.038
-I had no idea Amy was still
supposed to be at school.
-Don't blame yourself.

40:31.121 --> 40:32.748
She's very adept at...

40:32.831 --> 40:36.377
Well, let's not put it
too crudely, she has
a vivid imagination.

40:36.460 --> 40:38.170
-Brandy, wasn't it?
-Thank you.

40:42.466 --> 40:45.052
We will, of course,
reimburse you
for the damage to your car.

40:45.135 --> 40:46.762
I should hope so.

40:46.845 --> 40:48.430
And if you could arrange
a replacement

40:48.514 --> 40:51.100
so that I can
get myself and Amy
back to school.

40:51.183 --> 40:54.270
She's in the run-up
to her exams and
I'm responsible to her father

40:54.353 --> 40:56.855
to make sure
she at least tries
to pass them.

40:56.939 --> 40:58.649
Hold on. She hasn't sat
any of her exams?

41:01.235 --> 41:03.904
-Paul, I'm really...
-You haven't sat
a single exam?

41:03.988 --> 41:05.781
How could you have lied to me?

41:05.864 --> 41:08.659
I didn't mean to.
I didn't think you'd let me
stay if you knew.

41:08.742 --> 41:13.330
-You're damn right there.
-I'm so sorry. Please,
don't make me go back.

41:13.414 --> 41:16.250
It's bad enough letting me
down, you're not gonna
let your father down as well.

41:16.333 --> 41:17.626
Dad doesn't care.

41:17.710 --> 41:19.545
-Of course he does.
-No, he's never got time
for me.

41:19.628 --> 41:21.880
-And you're just the same.
-Go and pack, right now.

41:21.964 --> 41:26.552
-What? You're sending me away?
-Paul, sorry,
everybody's ready to start.

41:26.635 --> 41:28.137
Okay, okay, I'll be there.

41:28.220 --> 41:30.639
I want you ready to leave
by the time I get back.

41:31.932 --> 41:33.392
I hate you!

What do you think
you're doing?
This is my land.

43:08.779 --> 43:11.615
Which is why we thought we'd
remove this eyesore for you.

43:11.699 --> 43:14.535
Today's fishing party
are being picked up
as we speak

43:14.618 --> 43:17.913
and we should just about
have this in place
in time for lunch.

43:17.997 --> 43:20.291
Well, you can stop this
right now.

43:20.374 --> 43:23.210
Tam, would you mind awfully
if we chatted later?

43:23.669 --> 43:24.878
Paul.

43:25.921 --> 43:26.964
Paul!

43:28.841 --> 43:30.217
Amy's run away.

43:37.474 --> 43:42.271
-Don't worry about the lass,
she won't have got far.
-Have you got a minute?

43:42.354 --> 43:44.315
I've always got a minute
for you, Molly.

43:44.398 --> 43:47.818
-But I'm afraid right now
it can only be the one.
-I'll be quick.

43:47.902 --> 43:53.073
If I found out a woman
you trusted was in fact
a complete fraud,

43:53.157 --> 43:54.533
would you want me to tell you?

43:54.617 --> 43:56.702
-(SIGHING) Tricky.
-Is it?

43:56.785 --> 44:00.581
It's always hard when
someone tells you that your
judgement's completely off.

44:00.664 --> 44:02.625
Especially in affairs
of the heart.

44:02.708 --> 44:05.002
-You're right, you're right.
-I'd never speak to you again.

44:05.085 --> 44:06.170
Oh.

44:06.253 --> 44:08.672
But...

44:08.756 --> 44:10.883
I'd like to think
that you would risk my anger

44:10.966 --> 44:13.093
and do whatever
you thought best for me.

44:13.886 --> 44:15.095
Thank you.

44:25.689 --> 44:31.070
Molly. Molly, I wanted you
to be the first to know.

44:31.153 --> 44:34.573
-Kilwillie, what is it?
What's wrong?
-No, no, nothing's wrong.

44:34.657 --> 44:38.744
No, Edith has asked me
to marry her.

44:41.497 --> 44:45.668
Oh, you dear Molly,
you were absolutely right.

44:45.751 --> 44:48.254
But women know these things,
don't they?

44:48.337 --> 44:52.258
But I thought she said
she could never
trust a man again.

44:52.341 --> 44:55.552
Well, that's what means
so much to me, do you see?

44:57.054 --> 44:59.098
She thinks she can trust me.

45:01.183 --> 45:02.685
Do you want to marry her?

45:04.770 --> 45:07.147
We both know who
I want to marry!

45:07.231 --> 45:11.360
But... I've been
awfully lonely, Molly.

45:11.443 --> 45:16.949
And, you know,
Edith's a wonderful woman and
I think I'd be a fool not to.

45:19.118 --> 45:20.452
Kilwillie...

45:21.620 --> 45:24.582
Edith has been lying to you.

45:24.665 --> 45:26.750
She's not at all
who you think she is.

45:28.752 --> 45:31.422
What on earth do you mean?

45:31.505 --> 45:33.924
She'll be
attention seeking, Paul.
You shouldn't give in to her.

45:34.008 --> 45:35.593
Just drive.

45:37.011 --> 45:39.179
PAUL: There she is. Amy!

45:39.263 --> 45:40.681
-(CAR BANGING)
-(ENGINE SPLUTTERING)

45:40.764 --> 45:43.642
-What's going on?
-It's not me.

45:43.726 --> 45:44.810
Get me out.

45:49.315 --> 45:52.693
Amy! Amy, wait.

45:53.777 --> 45:55.237
Amy, come back.

45:56.780 --> 45:58.282
Stop, Amy.

45:59.825 --> 46:02.328
(AMY CRYING)

46:02.411 --> 46:05.372
-Get off me.
-Stop it. Come on. Please.

46:05.456 --> 46:06.999
Don't send me back.

46:07.082 --> 46:09.460
Please, don't send me back.

46:09.543 --> 46:11.837
I hate it there.

46:11.921 --> 46:14.673
Dad doesn't want to know.

46:14.757 --> 46:17.843
All he does is send me
money and presents.

46:18.761 --> 46:20.512
He doesn't listen.

46:23.015 --> 46:26.518
The headmaster says
I'm doing fine
because Dad pays him.

46:26.602 --> 46:27.895
But I'm not.

46:29.063 --> 46:30.564
I miss Mum.

46:32.066 --> 46:33.567
I miss my dad.

46:37.196 --> 46:39.365
You always listened to me.

46:41.700 --> 46:43.410
(AMY SOBBING)

46:45.371 --> 46:47.665
But I'm not sure
it's her, Molly.

46:47.748 --> 46:52.378
-I mean, there must be lots
of Edith Parkers in New York.
-I do hope you're right.

46:52.461 --> 46:55.547
Even if it is her, you can't
believe everything you read
in the newspapers,

46:55.631 --> 46:57.341
-can you?
-Shh! Here she comes.

46:57.424 --> 47:00.761
-Trust me.
-That's the trouble,
I always do.

47:06.475 --> 47:08.978
Ah, Edith.

47:09.061 --> 47:11.480
What is it? Where's Kilwillie?

47:11.564 --> 47:16.068
He's in a very dark place
and I'm afraid
it's all my fault.

47:16.151 --> 47:18.153
What is?

47:18.237 --> 47:22.324
I was just telling him
that your third,
or was it fourth husband,

47:22.408 --> 47:24.535
hadn't left you at all.

47:24.618 --> 47:28.539
And in fact, you'd ruined
him with your extravagance,
just like all the others.

47:28.622 --> 47:32.793
You devious,
self-righteous hypocrite.

47:32.876 --> 47:36.505
You don't want him,
but you don't want me
to have him.

47:36.589 --> 47:41.051
You want to rob that ass
of a man of the only chance
of happiness he might have.

47:41.135 --> 47:43.053
Edith, enough.

47:43.137 --> 47:46.140
At least he'll enjoy
spending his money on me.

47:46.223 --> 47:49.226
It's not as if
he has anyone else
to leave it to.

47:56.859 --> 47:59.028
Oh, Kilwillie. I'm so sorry.

48:02.781 --> 48:03.991
(SIGHS)

48:12.499 --> 48:13.626
I'm busy.

48:14.919 --> 48:16.420
So, what day's the rally?

48:23.052 --> 48:26.138
It doesn't change anything.

48:26.221 --> 48:29.141
-I'm still the same person.
-I lost Zoe, thanks to you.

48:29.224 --> 48:31.560
-(ENGINE STALLING)
-You can't have liked her
that much.

48:31.644 --> 48:34.647
You know, you're a daft wee
school girl that tells lies.

48:34.730 --> 48:36.148
Just leave me alone.

48:37.650 --> 48:38.817
I'm sorry.

48:41.487 --> 48:42.655
Amy.

48:52.122 --> 48:54.792
Do you think I did the right
thing, throwing her out?

48:55.876 --> 48:58.462
Of course you did.

48:58.545 --> 49:01.298
What you need is
a nice cup of tea.

49:01.382 --> 49:03.634
I've been such a fool.

49:03.717 --> 49:08.264
I should have known
a woman like her wouldn't be
genuinely interested in me.

49:08.347 --> 49:10.140
I should think not.

49:10.224 --> 49:12.726
She was a liar and a cheat.

49:12.810 --> 49:15.521
You deserve much better
than Edith Parker.

49:15.604 --> 49:18.440
One doesn't always get
what one deserves.

49:18.524 --> 49:21.735
-Edith did.
-She's right though, Molly.

49:21.819 --> 49:25.656
What good is all my money
if I've got no one
to spend it on?

49:25.739 --> 49:28.534
Kilwillie, you're still young.

49:28.617 --> 49:30.286
You'll find the right woman.

49:31.245 --> 49:32.371
I already did.

49:34.039 --> 49:37.001
Oh, dear, the headmaster.

49:44.550 --> 49:45.968
About time.

49:46.051 --> 49:47.386
Is this the driver?

49:47.469 --> 49:50.347
No, no. Sorry. Another brandy?

49:58.439 --> 50:01.483
-You're lucky to catch one
there. I never have.
-Paul. Paul!

50:05.029 --> 50:06.614
Uh, excuse me, gents.

50:12.661 --> 50:15.873
-You think you're so smart.
-Come on, Tam. A truce.

50:15.956 --> 50:18.334
Surely we can
work out some way
of putting up with each other.

50:18.417 --> 50:21.420
After you had me sent down.
No way.

50:21.503 --> 50:24.173
You'd better watch your back.
This is only the beginning.

50:24.256 --> 50:26.634
Hello again.
How's the fishing?

50:26.717 --> 50:29.094
-Do you know him?
-Jess told me
what was going on.

50:29.178 --> 50:31.180
I've never seen her before
in my life.

50:31.263 --> 50:34.934
-Hey, hang on.
-Yeah, my goddaughter's
talking to you.

50:35.017 --> 50:36.477
Picture turned out
really well.

50:38.145 --> 50:39.730
Here, give me that.

50:42.566 --> 50:43.901
Poaching salmon...

50:45.402 --> 50:47.780
You must have
enjoyed prison, Tam.

50:47.863 --> 50:51.283
With your record
you're looking at a nice
long sentence. Come on, Amy.

50:52.243 --> 50:54.161
Come on,
Laird, a couple of fish.

50:54.245 --> 50:55.746
I'll pay you for them.

51:00.542 --> 51:02.544
I'll tell you
how this works, Tam.

51:02.628 --> 51:05.798
If I see you round here again,
I'm calling the police.

51:05.881 --> 51:07.299
Now get off my land.

51:16.976 --> 51:18.185
Nice one.

51:24.275 --> 51:25.693
(DOOR OPENING)

51:27.736 --> 51:30.197
Right, I've spoken to Amy.

51:30.281 --> 51:32.366
I hope you got her to listen.

51:32.449 --> 51:35.703
Actually, she got me
to listen.

51:35.786 --> 51:39.331
Well, if she's ready,
we won't take up any more
of your time.

51:39.415 --> 51:43.127
-So, how would you say
she's getting on at school?
-Very well, indeed.

51:43.210 --> 51:45.212
You see, that's not
what she tells me.

51:45.296 --> 51:48.215
I think we've established
that she's a compulsive liar.

51:48.299 --> 51:50.259
Oh, I say, steady on.

51:51.135 --> 51:52.511
So, she's happy?

51:52.595 --> 51:55.514
No one expects
to be entirely happy
at school.

51:55.598 --> 51:58.350
And no one can do well
if they're entirely miserable.

51:58.434 --> 52:04.189
Now look here, the truth is
that girl has been trouble
since day one.

52:04.273 --> 52:08.485
She is wilful, cheeky,
dishonest and rather
unpopular with our girls.

52:08.569 --> 52:11.822
No, the truth is you're not
interested in Amy.
You're interested in fees

52:11.906 --> 52:15.367
and covering up the fact that
one of your pupils is so
unhappy she's run away.

52:15.451 --> 52:18.412
I've wasted enough
of my time here.

52:18.495 --> 52:21.624
-HEADMASTER: Amy!
-Do you think I'd let Amy go
anywhere with you?

52:21.707 --> 52:25.920
-Her father will have
something to say about that.
-He certainly will.

52:26.003 --> 52:28.923
And until I've spoken to him,
Amy stays here.

52:31.342 --> 52:33.010
You'll be hearing from me.

52:38.349 --> 52:39.475
(PAUL LAUGHING)

52:50.027 --> 52:52.821
Paul, I want you
to take this back.

52:52.905 --> 52:57.660
-No, no, I gave it
to you, Amy.
-For my 18th birthday.

52:57.743 --> 52:59.703
It's not my 18th birthday
for another two years.

53:01.956 --> 53:06.001
Please, I want you to give it
to me then,
when I'll deserve it.

53:14.969 --> 53:17.554
Hold on, you're not planning
on staying that long, are you?

53:19.765 --> 53:20.933
Right...

53:25.229 --> 53:26.814
How the hell did
that get there?
