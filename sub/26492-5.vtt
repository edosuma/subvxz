[narrator] <i>Previously on</i> Riverdale:

00:09.968 --> 00:11.886
Welcome to the Pit. Give us a show.

00:11.970 --> 00:12.971
Hit me.

00:13.388 --> 00:15.056
[Veronica] Warden Norton
is in your pocket.

00:15.140 --> 00:18.309
Everyone is in your pocket,
except for me and Archie.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.812
Where's Mad Dog?
Captain Golightly said he died.

00:20.895 --> 00:21.980
What'd you do to him?

00:22.063 --> 00:24.983
All three victims played
the game Gryphons and Gargoyles.

00:25.066 --> 00:27.485
You're admitting
the game killed Dilton and Ben?

00:27.569 --> 00:29.779
You've clearly played G&amp;G before.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.782
When you were my age,
there was another suspicious death

00:32.866 --> 00:34.492
where the corpse had blue lips.

00:34.576 --> 00:37.662
-[Alice] One of us was a murderer.
-[Betty] I saw a creature in the woods.

00:37.746 --> 00:40.498
What if it's the same person
from the Midnight Club?

00:40.582 --> 00:42.375
Swear to me that you won't play it.

00:42.459 --> 00:44.544
I want to be worthy, Ethel. Show me how.

00:44.627 --> 00:47.297
-Welcome to your first game.
-This game is pure evil.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.591
That book is our best shot
at figuring out what happened.

00:49.674 --> 00:51.301
[Archie] We're gonna get out of here.

00:51.384 --> 00:53.261
-We're escaping.
-Count me in.

00:58.808 --> 01:01.686
You are imprisoned
in the Gargoyle King's fortress. Trapped in pens, you live in fear,

01:05.315 --> 01:09.069
<i>never knowing when his Legion of Gargoyles</i>
<i>will descend from the sky to feed.</i>

01:09.611 --> 01:11.321
<i>But his guards are arrogant.</i>

01:11.404 --> 01:14.324
<i>You've been able to observe</i>
<i>and study their movements.</i>

01:15.116 --> 01:16.618
<i>And you've planned an escape.</i>

01:16.701 --> 01:19.746
It's down. Baby Teeth got to the breaker,
and cut the juice.

01:19.829 --> 01:20.830
You're sure?

01:21.915 --> 01:23.291
You're absolutely positive?

01:23.792 --> 01:26.419
We can squeeze through those wires
at the top corner.

01:26.503 --> 01:30.090
But it won't be long before they notice
and turn that fly-fryer back on.

01:30.298 --> 01:31.633
It's now or never, Archie.

01:35.678 --> 01:38.473
[Jughead]
<i>Roll the dice to decide your fate.</i>

01:39.808 --> 01:40.809
Let's do it.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.314
Now.

01:50.401 --> 01:51.402
[whistle blowing]

01:51.486 --> 01:52.570
[Jughead] <i>Remember...</i>

01:53.238 --> 01:54.114
<i>It's only a game.</i>

01:55.281 --> 01:56.699
<i>It's not life or death.</i>

01:58.034 --> 01:58.868
They wouldn't.

01:59.994 --> 02:01.663
[Jughead] <i>Unless, of course, it is.</i>

02:05.792 --> 02:06.793
[grunting]

02:21.808 --> 02:23.768
Your mission was unsuccessful.
Everyone dies.

02:23.852 --> 02:24.727
[all sigh]

02:24.811 --> 02:28.606
Jug, you won't believe
the story my mom told me last night.

02:30.942 --> 02:33.444
Jug, what are you doing?

02:34.487 --> 02:38.575
Betty, it's all making sense.
All of this is becoming clear.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.994
The game. The Gargoyle King.

02:41.077 --> 02:44.205
I'm on Level Three.
It's only a matter of time until I ascend.

02:44.706 --> 02:45.832
And I get to meet him.

02:47.625 --> 02:48.626
You've confirmed?

02:49.294 --> 02:51.671
So, my dad played G&amp;G in high school, huh?

02:51.754 --> 02:53.089
Of course. It makes sense.

02:53.173 --> 02:56.467
All of our parents did,
and they swore each other to secrecy.

02:56.551 --> 02:58.469
But, Jug, while they were playing,

02:58.553 --> 03:01.264
one of them killed
their principal back then,

03:01.347 --> 03:04.559
Felix Featherhead,
either accidentally or on purpose,

03:04.642 --> 03:06.603
but he had blue lips,

03:07.145 --> 03:08.479
just like Ben and Dilton.

03:08.563 --> 03:11.524
Which is why all of this has to stop.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.860
Betty, the fact our parents played G&amp;G

03:13.943 --> 03:16.112
just corroborates
what I've come to believe.

03:16.779 --> 03:20.909
That we have been playing this game
for a lot longer than we know.

03:20.992 --> 03:22.160
And off-board.

03:22.243 --> 03:24.120
Think about it. The Hot Dog rescue.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.580
What was it if not a quest?

03:25.997 --> 03:27.624
The Serpents, the Ghoulies.

03:27.707 --> 03:31.961
What are they if not warring tribes?
Might as well call us orcs and goblins.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.463
You're not making any sense.

03:33.546 --> 03:35.965
And you're also not listening
to what I'm saying.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.967
We have nine suspects

03:38.051 --> 03:41.221
that are all real, tangible leads.

03:41.304 --> 03:44.599
One of our parents could be a murderer.
Let's go investigate them.

03:44.682 --> 03:46.142
You're not seeing the big picture.

03:47.143 --> 03:50.271
Eldervair,
the realm of Gryphons and Gargoyles,

03:50.355 --> 03:52.232
is an anagram for "Riverdale."

03:52.690 --> 03:55.109
The whole game is an analog for Riverdale.

03:55.193 --> 03:59.197
The game only exists in Riverdale.
That's why we couldn't find it on the Web.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.407
Okay, well, that is a weird coincidence.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.826
It's not a coincidence.
It's all connected.

04:03.910 --> 04:08.206
It's all one big narrative,
that's still being written and played.

04:08.289 --> 04:11.042
You need to calm down, Jug.
Who's telling you this?

04:11.125 --> 04:14.545
The game. The more I play,
the more familiar I become with Eldervair,

04:14.629 --> 04:16.965
and its rules.
The more I see the patterns.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.841
The more I understand him or her.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.261
And how we'll catch The Gargoyle King.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.930
This game is their psychology.
Their imagination.

04:24.013 --> 04:25.223
How they view Riverdale.

04:25.306 --> 04:28.184
My mom was right.
This game messes with your head.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.687
No. This is the clarity I needed.
It's the truth.

04:31.312 --> 04:34.232
G&amp;G's myths, they're our stories.
Our parents' stories.

04:34.315 --> 04:37.610
It's simple logic, Betty.
How do you catch a game master?

04:39.237 --> 04:40.905
Become a game master yourself.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.407
That's what I'm doing.

04:42.490 --> 04:45.868
And in the end,
when I prove that I'm at his level...

04:47.704 --> 04:49.330
I'll come face-to-face with him.

04:49.872 --> 04:50.707
Fine.

04:51.749 --> 04:53.793
Fine. As long as you're

04:53.876 --> 04:56.546
safe down here,
that's one less thing to worry about.

04:56.629 --> 04:58.131
So, you-- You keep playing.

04:59.007 --> 05:02.218
I'm gonna go figure this out,
starting with our nine suspects.

05:10.643 --> 05:13.021
Go on a run with me
one of these mornings, <i>mija.</i>

05:14.147 --> 05:15.606
Nothing's more invigorating.

05:19.485 --> 05:23.489
By the way, did you hear what happened
at Leopold and Loeb?

05:25.825 --> 05:28.661
Apparently some inmates tried to escape.

05:29.245 --> 05:33.458
I hear the ringleader was,
once again, Archie Andrews.

05:35.209 --> 05:37.337
But no worries.
The guards caught them all.

05:37.795 --> 05:40.798
After shooting them with rubber bullets.
They'll be punished.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.634
Might add a year to Archie's sentence.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.595
[Hiram chuckles]

05:49.474 --> 05:52.769
My friend, Warden Norton,
runs an awfully tight ship.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.980
I know you're trying
to set me off right now,

05:56.189 --> 05:57.148
but it won't work.

05:58.274 --> 06:00.234
I'm getting Archie out,
one way or the other.

06:01.277 --> 06:03.780
And then you'll be the one rotting away,

06:04.072 --> 06:06.324
in the very prison
your blood money has built.

06:15.833 --> 06:16.667
Yes.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.128
Warden Norton, please.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.216
Are you comfortable?

06:23.883 --> 06:26.719
The idea to escape was all mine.
I told them to do it.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.304
Why am I not surprised?

06:33.518 --> 06:34.519
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:36.145 --> 06:37.188
What are you doing?

06:38.606 --> 06:40.066
Let this serve as a reminder.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.069
You can't fight your destiny.

06:44.153 --> 06:45.613
No, please. No, don't.

06:45.696 --> 06:46.989

06:49.784 --> 06:50.993
[school bell ringing]

06:51.702 --> 06:54.539
Hold up. You're telling me that my mother

06:54.622 --> 07:00.086
was a rule-breaking,
anti-apartheid activist in high school?

07:00.378 --> 07:02.755
And that she and my dad
were together back then?

07:04.006 --> 07:05.007
I don't buy it.

07:05.758 --> 07:08.761
There's no way my old man hung out
and did, like, cosplay

07:08.845 --> 07:10.471
with a group of lame-ass nerds.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.598
Okay, it's true, Reggie.

07:12.682 --> 07:16.185
And you want us to find out what, exactly?

07:17.687 --> 07:21.023
My suspicion is that
whoever was running the game back then

07:21.107 --> 07:24.485
is running it now,
which is why we need to stop them

07:24.569 --> 07:26.904
-before things get any worse.
-What are you saying?

07:26.988 --> 07:31.367
One of our parents might be responsible
for what happened to Dilton and Ben?

07:31.451 --> 07:32.326
Maybe.

07:32.410 --> 07:35.496
You can't tell them
that you know about their Midnight Club.

07:35.580 --> 07:39.167
You have to be careful and subtle
when you ask them what they know.

07:42.545 --> 07:45.214
[Elio] The speakeasy is impressive,
Veronica.

07:45.423 --> 07:49.802
Impeccable taste and a little elbow grease
go a long way, Elio.

07:50.553 --> 07:51.846
But from what I hear,

07:51.929 --> 07:55.766
your Sweetwater Casino will soon be
giving the Miragio a run for its money.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.896
You know, if you added a couple of slots,
table games,

07:59.979 --> 08:01.731
maybe cocktails with actual liquor,

08:01.814 --> 08:04.901
you'd have quite the little goldmine
on your manicured hands.

08:04.984 --> 08:08.196
Thank you
for mansplaining my business to me.

08:09.113 --> 08:13.201
-But that's not why I asked you here.
-Right. You want to talk Leopold and Loeb?

08:13.284 --> 08:14.494
More than talk.

08:15.536 --> 08:19.999
Archie is locked away in that hellhole,
and I haven't heard from him in weeks.

08:20.082 --> 08:22.543
I've hit a dead end
with the Innocence Project.

08:22.627 --> 08:23.461
However...

08:24.003 --> 08:27.548
I've heard rumors
that L and L has direct ties to the Mob.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.968
I thought you,
with your connections, could help.

08:33.763 --> 08:34.722
Tell you what, Veronica.

08:34.805 --> 08:37.725
I'll talk to my dad's friends,

09:14.971 --> 09:17.515
When this arrow shot right through it.

09:17.598 --> 09:20.017
Three feet to the left

09:20.560 --> 09:22.228
Yeah, we were practicing our aim.

-Tough.

You're the Serpent King, Jones.
Isn't that enough?

24:45.567 --> 24:48.028
I don't really care, as long as it's red.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.948
If you need to call Warden Norton
to get me cleared--

24:52.032 --> 24:53.742
Ah, that won't be necessary, miss.

24:54.409 --> 24:55.410
Sorry for the delay.

24:57.287 --> 24:59.039
[Jughead] Good job. You're inside.

24:59.247 --> 25:00.415
Pantera, you're up.

25:03.627 --> 25:04.920
Whoa. Where you going with that?

25:05.670 --> 25:08.340
I'm supposed to put this
with the other refreshments.

25:09.174 --> 25:10.800
If you don't mind, I can run this inside.

25:22.812 --> 25:23.855
I think it's starting.

25:27.943 --> 25:29.945
[Jughead] <i>We're entering the lion's den.</i>

25:30.362 --> 25:32.489
The Paladin is being marched in,

25:33.448 --> 25:34.449
to meet his doom.

25:35.242 --> 25:36.368
<i>For he must face...</i>

25:38.286 --> 25:39.829
<i>a resurrected hellhound.</i>

25:48.547 --> 25:49.422
[bell rings]

25:52.133 --> 25:54.844
Mad Dog. Thought you were dead.
Where have you been?

25:56.346 --> 25:57.639
It's me, Archie.

25:58.848 --> 26:00.308
[grunting and shouting]

26:26.459 --> 26:27.544
Care for a drink?

26:29.671 --> 26:32.716
I just overheard some guards
betting heavily against Archie.

26:33.967 --> 26:35.010
They say he's going down.

26:36.094 --> 26:38.305
That other guy's huge.
I'm not sure Archie's got long.

26:39.764 --> 26:40.640
[grunts]

26:41.141 --> 26:41.975
Okay.

26:43.518 --> 26:45.395
Get in position. Wait for my signal.

26:54.362 --> 26:56.489
[Jughead] <i>You've arrived</i>
<i>at the Mad Emperor's tunnel.</i>

26:56.573 --> 26:57.741
You've found the entrance.

26:58.158 --> 27:02.120
But the Mad Emperor has placed
a Bano protection spell on the barrier.

27:02.203 --> 27:03.663
Well, that is super annoying.

27:08.835 --> 27:09.794
Joaquin?

27:11.004 --> 27:12.589
Kevin, what are you doing here?

27:12.672 --> 27:15.008
Breaking Archie out.
What are you doing here?

27:16.843 --> 27:19.763
It doesn't matter,
and it's too late for Archie.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.807
Where are you going? Back to the Serpents?

27:23.350 --> 27:25.477
No, no, no. I joined a different gang.

27:25.560 --> 27:27.395
-Who?
-You don't want to know, Kevin.

27:27.562 --> 27:30.065
Just leave.
You've gotta get out of here right now.

27:31.149 --> 27:32.400
-Wait--
-Go. Go.

27:32.484 --> 27:33.485
Wait, Joaquin. Come on, hit me.

27:40.283 --> 27:41.242
Right here, do it.

27:47.290 --> 27:49.626
I'm not fighting you. You're not my enemy.

27:50.043 --> 27:51.127
But listen to me.

27:51.211 --> 27:52.420
There's a plan in place.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.464
My girl is gonna cause a commotion.

27:54.547 --> 27:57.175
I'll make a break
for the drain underneath the ring.

27:57.258 --> 27:58.134
Come with me.

28:04.516 --> 28:05.975
You'll never make it.

28:06.559 --> 28:08.019
Not after getting shivved.

28:08.978 --> 28:10.188
Yes, I can.

28:11.815 --> 28:12.941
You need a head start.

28:16.486 --> 28:18.655
Deadeye Blossom. You're up.

28:18.738 --> 28:19.781
Betty, thank God.

28:19.864 --> 28:23.576
-Kev, why isn't the grate open?
<i>-</i>There's a lock we didn't know about.

28:24.452 --> 28:26.621
But look. Joaquin was just here.

28:27.414 --> 28:29.791
-I have to go after him.
-Well, I got this,

28:29.874 --> 28:32.335
but you can't go after Joaquin.
What about Archie?

28:32.419 --> 28:33.628
I'll be back. I promise.

28:34.921 --> 28:36.589
[Cheryl] What is it, game master?

28:36.965 --> 28:38.007
It's a curveball.

28:41.010 --> 28:44.097
You're about to come face-to-face
with the Dark Dragon.

28:44.431 --> 28:47.475
<i>The most evil-tempered,</i>
<i>vile creature in the land.</i>

28:47.934 --> 28:50.228
<i>With forked tongue,</i>
<i>and snarling black slime,</i>

28:50.311 --> 28:51.938
<i>it reeks of rotting flesh.</i>

28:52.021 --> 28:54.023
Veronica, what are you doing here?

28:55.567 --> 28:59.279
I could ask you the same, Daddy.
But I bet my answer is better than yours.

28:59.362 --> 29:02.574
Whatever scheme you've cooked up,
it ends right now.

29:03.658 --> 29:04.909
Sorry, Daddykins.

29:05.910 --> 29:08.371
This is gonna hurt you a lot more
than it will me.

29:09.581 --> 29:10.582
Ow! Well played.

29:11.791 --> 29:14.419
You've impaled the dragon
with your concealed dagger.

29:33.313 --> 29:34.355
Let's go. Come on.

29:35.815 --> 29:37.025
I won't get through the grate.

29:37.942 --> 29:40.653
I tried. But you go.
I'll hold off the guards.

29:40.737 --> 29:42.280
-Yeah, but you--
-Just go, Red!

29:42.363 --> 29:43.364
Don't look back.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.458
Warden, he's getting away.

29:53.541 --> 29:55.043
Guards. Stop him!

29:55.126 --> 29:56.127
[whistle blows]

30:06.179 --> 30:08.056
[thudding and grunting]

30:21.986 --> 30:23.321
Find him.

30:26.199 --> 30:28.076
You know where that pipe leads?

30:31.329 --> 30:34.999
Find him right now!

30:39.629 --> 30:40.463
Archie.

30:41.339 --> 30:42.715
[panting]

30:53.101 --> 30:54.519
-Betty.
-Hi.

30:55.019 --> 30:57.772
-What took you so long?
-I could ask you the same thing.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.107
Are these clothes for me?

30:59.274 --> 31:00.275
Oh, my God. You're bleeding.

31:03.987 --> 31:05.238
Here. Put pressure on it.

31:05.697 --> 31:06.698
Here, come here.

31:09.409 --> 31:11.035
[Jughead] You freed the Paladin,

31:11.119 --> 31:12.912
but you're not clear
of the Mad Emperor yet.

31:13.037 --> 31:14.497
[engine sputtering]

31:23.214 --> 31:25.633
What the hell are you waiting for?
Go after them!

31:25.842 --> 31:28.678
In fact, the Emperor sends
a ruthless cavalry in pursuit.

31:29.095 --> 31:32.348
<i>Your noble steed is no match</i>
<i>for the cavalry's mighty stallions.</i>

31:32.974 --> 31:34.601
Do you continue on your path?

31:35.435 --> 31:37.395
Or do you surrender and beg for mercy?

31:37.478 --> 31:38.563
-Keep going.
-Never give up.

31:38.646 --> 31:40.481
-Go. Go.
-Keep going.

31:40.565 --> 31:42.358
You lean forward in your saddle,

31:42.442 --> 31:44.569
<i>urging your horse to fly.</i>

31:44.694 --> 31:47.238
On all sides,
the forest becomes a blur of green.

31:48.031 --> 31:49.449
<i>But a quick peek back...</i>

31:49.824 --> 31:53.620
<i>reveals the Emperors nightmares</i>
<i>galloping at supernatural speed.</i>

31:53.703 --> 31:56.873
It's like hell itself is chasing you,
and it's gaining ground.

31:57.248 --> 31:58.333
<i>One loose rock,</i>

31:59.208 --> 32:02.587
<i>one cursed root would send you toppling</i>
<i>at this lethal speed.</i>

32:02.837 --> 32:05.089
But you force those thoughts
out of your mind.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.509
<i>You feel the battle fury</i>
<i>of your forefathers</i>

32:09.052 --> 32:10.386
<i>rise within you.</i>

32:10.470 --> 32:13.306
<i>An inextinguishable fire,</i>
<i>pulsing through your veins.</i>

32:13.932 --> 32:16.309
<i>You are the light,</i>
<i>outrunning the darkness.</i>

32:16.851 --> 32:18.645
[guard] Go around. He's on the other side.

32:18.728 --> 32:20.104
[Jughead] <i>You will escape.</i>

32:20.188 --> 32:22.190
<i>You will be victorious.</i>

32:22.941 --> 32:23.942
But then...

32:24.025 --> 32:25.944
you're barreling towards the edge
of a cliff.

32:26.027 --> 32:26.861
<i>You must stop.</i>

32:35.745 --> 32:37.413
What can we do for you, fellas?

32:37.664 --> 32:38.498
[Jughead] <i>Bravo.</i>

32:38.998 --> 32:40.750
Your deception gambit has paid off.

32:41.250 --> 32:42.835
You've outsmarted the Emperor's cavalry.

32:42.919 --> 32:43.920
Yeah!

32:44.671 --> 32:45.546
Yes!

32:50.343 --> 32:51.719
[police sirens wailing]

33:11.781 --> 33:12.865
Game master.

33:13.616 --> 33:15.326
Um, hello? What happened?

33:15.660 --> 33:17.078
Did we save the Red Paladin?

33:18.287 --> 33:20.957
I don't know.
I made a last-minute change to the quest.

33:21.040 --> 33:24.210
I was hoping to have the ending
or answer when we got this far.

33:24.293 --> 33:27.547
-What do you mean, you don't know?
-Where is the Red Paladin?

33:28.006 --> 33:29.215
Where is he?

33:30.049 --> 33:31.759
Where is the Red Paladin?

33:33.720 --> 33:35.680
I don't know what you're talking about.

33:35.763 --> 33:37.181
Let him go, Warden Norton.

33:39.058 --> 33:40.977
Let him go, or I'll mace you.

33:46.274 --> 33:47.108
Fall back.

33:48.317 --> 33:49.777
Everyone, back to the center.

33:59.412 --> 34:00.955
Is it over? Did he die?

34:01.831 --> 34:02.999
[banging nearby]

34:08.546 --> 34:09.422
[banging continues]

34:16.637 --> 34:18.056
[groans, then panting]

34:34.697 --> 34:37.533
There. You are all patched up.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.702
Don't make any sudden movements.

34:40.244 --> 34:41.454
I won't. Thanks, Toni.

34:49.295 --> 34:50.713
Who did that to you, Archie?

34:51.547 --> 34:53.341
It was Joaquin. He stabbed me.

34:54.300 --> 34:56.010
I think the warden made him do it.

35:01.849 --> 35:03.184
Guys, where the hell am I?

35:04.185 --> 35:05.478
In Dilton Doiley's bunker.

35:05.561 --> 35:08.064
[Betty] The only people
who know it exists are in this room.

35:08.147 --> 35:11.067
Now it's the safest place
in Riverdale for you, I promise.

35:11.442 --> 35:12.819
Dilton Doiley has a bunker?

35:15.029 --> 35:17.657
We'll catch you up to speed
once you're rested, okay?

35:20.827 --> 35:21.953
Archie?

35:24.831 --> 35:26.124
What is that on your hip?

35:27.959 --> 35:29.335
Courtesy of Warden Norton.

35:30.586 --> 35:34.173
To put me in my place,
after I tried to escape the first time.

35:34.257 --> 35:36.509
The warden branded you,
and ordered Joaquin to stab you?

35:38.803 --> 35:39.679
Jug.

35:45.184 --> 35:46.811
Can I have everyone's attention?

35:51.107 --> 35:53.317
Since my father saw me,

35:53.401 --> 35:55.945
I need to do some damage control
on the home front.

35:56.028 --> 35:59.365
But someone needs to stay with Archie,
at all times.

35:59.448 --> 36:01.367
Ronnie, I don't need anyone--

36:01.450 --> 36:02.743
Yes. You do.

36:02.827 --> 36:05.663
You go ahead, V.
Jughead and I will take the first shift.

36:05.746 --> 36:06.664
Excellent.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.959
Now, equally important...

36:10.501 --> 36:14.297
everyone in this room is part of a pact.

36:14.881 --> 36:15.923
From this moment on,

36:16.382 --> 36:18.509
no one knows where this bunker is.

36:19.510 --> 36:22.346
No one was involved with that breakout.

36:23.556 --> 36:26.601
And no one is aware
of Archie's whereabouts.

36:29.061 --> 36:29.937
To the grave.

36:31.856 --> 36:32.690
Capiche?

36:41.282 --> 36:42.783
Are you out of your mind, Hiram?

36:42.867 --> 36:45.494
Archie escaped
from an underground fight club?

36:45.953 --> 36:47.121
That you knew about?

36:47.205 --> 36:49.248
I am being hounded by social workers.

36:49.332 --> 36:51.709
The Innocence Project
is breathing down my neck.

36:51.792 --> 36:54.837
I mean, for God's sake,
I took donations from Warden Norton.

36:54.921 --> 36:57.423
Stop yelling.
We can get ahead of it. Contain it.

36:58.883 --> 37:00.218
Oh, and finally.

37:01.344 --> 37:02.220
She arrives.

37:02.303 --> 37:04.555
Do you have any idea the mess you've made?

37:05.264 --> 37:07.225
Me? What about your husband?

37:07.934 --> 37:08.851
[scoffs]

37:08.935 --> 37:09.977
[speaking in Spanish]

37:10.061 --> 37:11.938
You two are unbelievable.

37:12.313 --> 37:17.276
This obsession that you both have with
Archie Andrews is going to destroy us.

37:22.073 --> 37:23.616
Where the hell are you going?

37:23.699 --> 37:26.118
To try and contain the mess
that you and your daughter made.

37:28.663 --> 37:30.289
[door opens, then closes]

37:33.584 --> 37:35.461
I tried to find him, but it was no use.

37:35.544 --> 37:37.672
-I had to double back, and be the decoy.
-Oh, tsk, tsk.

37:42.051 --> 37:43.594
-Thanks, Pop.
-[Pop] You're welcome.

37:45.388 --> 37:46.430
He's out there.

37:47.306 --> 37:48.849
Joaquin is out there.

37:51.644 --> 37:54.647
-I can't believe we pulled off the escape.
-Shh.

37:54.730 --> 37:57.024
Sorry. My bad.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.567
It's a secret.

37:58.651 --> 37:59.527
[Josie] Yeah.

38:01.195 --> 38:02.154
Speaking of...

38:03.322 --> 38:05.032
Are we gonna do this or not?

38:10.037 --> 38:11.038
I don't know, guys.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.248
Come on, Josie.

38:12.331 --> 38:16.210
Don't you want to find out
what our parents and Betty won't tell us?

38:21.882 --> 38:23.217
I want to know the truth.

38:23.968 --> 38:24.885
Wherever it leads.

38:29.640 --> 38:33.477
[man on radio] <i>We interrupt our top-ten</i>
<i>countdown with an important news bulletin.</i>

38:33.602 --> 38:36.063
<i>Convicted murderer Archibald Andrews</i>
<i>has escaped</i>

38:36.147 --> 38:38.733
<i>from the Leopold and Loeb</i>
<i>Juvenile Detention Center.</i>

38:39.025 --> 38:40.443
<i>He is extremely dangerous.</i>

38:40.526 --> 38:42.486
<i>The public is advised to remain indoors</i>

38:42.945 --> 38:44.655
<i>and to report suspicious activity.</i>

38:45.114 --> 38:48.326
<i>It is believed he will seek refuge</i>
<i>in his hometown of Riverdale.</i>

38:50.911 --> 38:52.246
He's finally asleep.

38:52.788 --> 38:56.375
-Jug, his burn mark.
-You mean his brand.

38:57.585 --> 39:00.296
Looks like a runic symbol
from Gryphons and Gargoyles.

39:00.796 --> 39:01.714
[sighs]

39:01.797 --> 39:06.302
-He said the warden gave it to him.
-The warden called Archie a Red Paladin.

39:06.385 --> 39:09.722
Does that mean the warden is playing G&amp;G?

39:09.805 --> 39:11.390
See? This is what I'm saying.

39:11.474 --> 39:14.226
This game is so much bigger
than a couple kids playing.

39:15.269 --> 39:17.688
What if Warden Norton
is The Gargoyle King?

39:18.314 --> 39:19.148
Jug.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.234
Before we dive back in...

39:23.194 --> 39:26.113
I think you should go home
and get some rest.

39:26.489 --> 39:28.657
How long has it been since you've slept?

39:30.576 --> 39:32.453
Just get a couple hours at least.

39:33.871 --> 39:35.164
I'll take this watch.

39:44.340 --> 39:45.508
Sleep well, Paladin.

39:47.676 --> 39:50.262
I have a bad feeling
your trials are only beginning.

40:07.571 --> 40:08.697
[knock on door]

40:09.740 --> 40:11.826
Sir? Mayor Lodge is here.

40:12.576 --> 40:13.869
She'd like to have a word.

40:16.038 --> 40:17.415
Tell her I'll be right out.

40:20.876 --> 40:22.044
[Jughead] <i>In the end...</i>

40:22.878 --> 40:24.505
<i>why did Warden Norton do it?</i>

40:25.631 --> 40:28.050
<i>Was he afraid of retribution</i>
<i>from the authorities</i>

40:28.134 --> 40:29.552
<i>for his illegal activities?</i>

40:30.678 --> 40:33.097
<i>Or was it that the game of G&amp;G</i>
<i>he'd been playing</i>

40:33.389 --> 40:34.390
<i>was finally over?</i>

40:36.559 --> 40:39.311
<i>And the Gargoyle King</i>
<i>was calling him home to ascend.</i>

40:40.980 --> 40:43.399
<i>Either way, the result was the same.</i>

40:44.233 --> 40:45.860
<i>Death by cyanide poisoning.</i>

41:14.138 --> 41:15.264
[gasping]

41:31.447 --> 41:32.448
[branches crack]
