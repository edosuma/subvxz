01:11.538 --> 01:15.497
Long life to Your Imperial Majesty.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.673
The two lions have arrived
in the courtyard.

01:20.513 --> 01:23.277
They are here to perform
for the dowager empress.

01:23.616 --> 01:26.676
Long life to Your Majesty.

01:27.387 --> 01:31.517
Her Imperial Majesty,
the dowager empress.

01:38.198 --> 01:43.158
May the dowager empress
live forever!

01:43.503 --> 01:46.666
Long life to Her Imperial Majesty!

02:02.755 --> 02:10.526
Her Imperial Majesty,
the dowager empress approaches!

02:17.837 --> 02:23.901
May the dowager empress
live forever!

02:24.277 --> 02:28.270
Long life to Her Imperial Majesty!

02:46.366 --> 02:49.199
Your Majesty,
that contraption is called a camera.

02:50.603 --> 02:51.399
Camera?!

02:53.139 --> 02:56.870
These foreigners
and their strange ways!

02:57.310 --> 03:01.041
They come to China and praise us
for our great naval power

03:01.548 --> 03:04.847
and the very next moment they proceed
to sink all our war ships.

03:05.752 --> 03:09.449
Hung chang, is it possible these
young lions could be made use of

03:10.089 --> 03:13.752
to drive out the foreigners?

03:16.329 --> 03:17.694
Your Majesty,

03:18.298 --> 03:19.959
our country has been host to an ever

03:20.133 --> 03:21.293
increasing number of foreigners

03:21.734 --> 03:24.464
all of whom have designs
upon your lands.

03:24.871 --> 03:27.772
And I think the best way of
defeating their plans

03:28.107 --> 03:32.305
would be to set foreigner
against foreigner.

03:32.745 --> 03:35.339
If they start quarrelling
we'll take advantage of the situation

03:35.682 --> 03:40.415
and drive them out
of the country forever.

03:40.853 --> 03:45.620
However, for that to happen, we must
encourage the practice of kung fu.

03:46.025 --> 03:49.552
By organising demonstrations
such as this.

03:49.829 --> 03:52.093
we can provide entertainment
for the masses

03:52.432 --> 03:55.731
and show the foreigners

03:56.002 --> 03:59.233
how strong our country is!

03:59.639 --> 04:02.301
Yes, that's a good idea.

04:02.775 --> 04:03.241
Hung chang

04:03.509 --> 04:09.937
Let's organize a grand competition
for the title of Lion King.

06:42.935 --> 06:45.062
Beijing Railway Station

06:47.473 --> 06:53.309
Get your buns here!
They're hot and fresh!

06:53.579 --> 06:55.638
That bloody train
took so long I'm exhausted!

06:55.882 --> 06:57.008
Hey! Don't push our lion head!

06:57.350 --> 06:58.009
I'm sorry.

06:59.118 --> 07:01.882
Master, Beijing is
much busier than Canton.

07:02.455 --> 07:04.923
Foon, there are all kinds
of people here, so behave.

07:05.958 --> 07:06.481
Excuse me.

07:08.961 --> 07:11.691
Even the foreigners here
can speak Chinese.

07:11.964 --> 07:13.454
The world is changing!

07:13.800 --> 07:15.825
I think we should learn
foreign languages,

07:16.169 --> 07:17.966
so we can communicate

07:18.237 --> 07:20.205
with the foreigners more easily.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.198
I can speak a foreign language.

07:22.475 --> 07:22.941
Really?

07:23.242 --> 07:23.833
Beautiful!

07:24.210 --> 07:26.007
Beau tofu? What does it mean?

07:26.279 --> 07:27.246
I don't know, but some men said it

07:27.480 --> 07:29.448
when they saw 13th Aunt,

07:29.649 --> 07:30.741
so it must be a greeting.

07:31.017 --> 07:31.642
Is that so?

07:32.718 --> 07:34.583
Where is 13th Aunt?

07:34.854 --> 07:37.948
We got off the train together,
didn't we?

07:38.458 --> 07:39.288
We've lost her!

07:39.459 --> 07:40.187
13th Aunt!

07:40.760 --> 07:41.624
13th Aunt!

07:41.828 --> 07:44.797
It's a Chinese lady dressed as a foreigner.

07:44.964 --> 07:45.988
Excuse me.

07:46.833 --> 07:48.994
Master, I found 13th Aunt. This way!

07:49.969 --> 07:50.628
13th Aunt.

07:51.103 --> 07:53.003
Foon, Fei hung.

07:53.539 --> 07:54.528
I'd like you to meet someone.

07:55.241 --> 07:56.606
This is my Russian friend.

07:56.909 --> 07:58.240
I know him when I was in England.

07:58.578 --> 07:59.545
Mr. Tomansky.

08:00.346 --> 08:00.641
Hello.

08:01.013 --> 08:01.638
Hello.

08:02.181 --> 08:05.150
This is Wong Fei hung, and this is
his disciple Leung Foon.

08:05.718 --> 08:08.278
"Beautiful"! "Beautiful"!

08:08.955 --> 08:09.944
You are very interesting!

08:11.157 --> 08:12.488
I see you speak English.
Are they in the theatre?

08:13.192 --> 08:13.920
What?

08:14.126 --> 08:16.094
I'd no idea
you could speak Chinese so well.

08:16.929 --> 08:18.692
I'm an interpreter, so I have to.

08:22.535 --> 08:25.766
Look, it's some foreign women
dressed as Chinese ladies.

08:29.208 --> 08:30.732
Thanks very much for teaching me

08:31.110 --> 08:32.441
my first Chinese sentence.

08:33.011 --> 08:36.243
You know, it's your fault
I fell in love with China.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.784
In fact you are the reason
I decided to come out here.

08:40.785 --> 08:42.720
I think about you every day.

08:43.489 --> 08:44.820
I hope you're not married yet.

08:44.857 --> 08:45.585
What?

08:46.692 --> 08:47.886
I see you still have the camera

08:48.060 --> 08:49.391
I gave you.

08:49.962 --> 08:51.623
I hope you still think about me.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.332
I can't believe my luck

08:53.733 --> 08:55.360
finding you here like this.

08:55.768 --> 08:57.463
It must be fate, right?

08:58.004 --> 08:58.732
"Beautiful"?

08:59.071 --> 08:59.935
What's up with you?

09:00.106 --> 09:00.800
Go on, find a rickshaw.

09:01.774 --> 09:02.866
No need to shout.

09:05.177 --> 09:06.769
Mr. Wong, I have a carriage, it would

09:07.413 --> 09:08.937
be my pleasure to share it with you.

09:09.248 --> 09:11.148
I couldn't take advantage
of our chance meeting.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.048
Fate demands that we part.

09:13.352 --> 09:14.250
Let's go.

09:16.122 --> 09:18.022
That's not very sanitary.

09:18.324 --> 09:20.155
We Chinese don't like
to be touched like that.

09:20.993 --> 09:22.585
Is he your boyfriend?

09:23.362 --> 09:24.294
I'm more than just a boyfriend,

09:24.597 --> 09:25.621
I'm her relative.

09:25.865 --> 09:26.763
Aren't I, 13th Aunt?

09:27.500 --> 09:30.196
You mean you two are really cousins?

09:31.103 --> 09:33.037
It may not mean a lot
to you foreigners

09:33.306 --> 09:34.933
but here,
cousins are extremely close.

09:35.207 --> 09:37.232
Some day you may find out how close.

09:37.577 --> 09:38.168
Come on.

09:39.312 --> 09:40.745
Fei hung, what's got into you?

09:41.047 --> 09:41.809
I had good temper to him.

09:42.014 --> 09:42.810
That camera, was it from him?

09:42.982 --> 09:44.449
Yes, I learnt photography from him.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.350
Fei hung!

09:46.619 --> 09:49.213
Stop calling me 13th Aunt or you'll

09:49.522 --> 09:51.786
never learn to call me anything else.

09:52.158 --> 09:53.182
Use my first name.

09:53.726 --> 09:55.785
Your first name is...

09:56.095 --> 09:59.064
Pe... Peony.

09:59.231 --> 10:00.721
Where's Foon? Where's he gone?

10:03.302 --> 10:05.532
Get him!

10:06.038 --> 10:06.936
Get him!

10:07.239 --> 10:08.638
He's causing trouble again.

10:09.842 --> 10:10.240
Watch out!

10:13.145 --> 10:13.941
Watch this hand!

10:14.780 --> 10:15.246
And watch this foot!

10:20.186 --> 10:20.811
My camera!

10:21.053 --> 10:21.951
Watch your back!

10:22.254 --> 10:23.414
Watch the fist.

10:23.923 --> 10:25.049
Watch the kick!

10:25.391 --> 10:26.619
Watch the leg!

10:26.826 --> 10:29.659
And watch the...

10:31.297 --> 10:33.026
Now then, what seems
to be the problem?

10:33.332 --> 10:36.495
Problem?
He's taken three rickshaws

10:36.569 --> 10:37.831
that's what the problem is.

10:38.337 --> 10:39.201
I see.

10:39.605 --> 10:40.765
We'll let you have them back.

10:40.973 --> 10:41.234
Foon?

10:41.440 --> 10:41.906
Yes.

10:42.675 --> 10:44.336
Unload those three rickshaws.
Right.

10:45.344 --> 10:46.436
And apologies.
Right.

10:46.779 --> 10:48.110
Sorry.

10:48.948 --> 10:49.505
Ah, my leg!

10:49.715 --> 10:50.113
Are you hurt?

10:50.282 --> 10:51.112
No. I'm fine.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.080
Know what you need?
Watch the leg.

10:53.886 --> 10:54.545
Not again!

10:54.620 --> 10:55.314
"The Cantonese Consulate"

10:55.521 --> 10:59.582
It's a flush!

10:59.825 --> 11:02.589
That makes 16 rounds in total!

11:02.928 --> 11:03.792
Is it really 16 rounds?

11:04.530 --> 11:07.556
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine...

11:07.967 --> 11:09.992
It's amazing!

11:10.269 --> 11:12.362
How poor am I!

11:12.872 --> 11:15.033
"The All Powerful Cantonese Lions"

11:21.647 --> 11:22.978
Can you hear it?

11:23.249 --> 11:23.613
Master Wong!

11:24.050 --> 11:24.539
Hi.

11:25.184 --> 11:26.674
Master Wong Kei ying!
Hello, how Are you?

11:26.986 --> 11:27.850
Hello, Master Wong.

11:28.888 --> 11:30.116
Oh, it's Wong.

11:30.790 --> 11:33.816
Kin chon!
How's your business in Hong Kong?

11:34.093 --> 11:35.993
I hear your son's coming to visit.

11:36.295 --> 11:38.729
Yes. He's coming
to see my new medicine factory.

11:38.898 --> 11:40.456
I'm playing mahjong, see you later.

11:40.666 --> 11:41.690
Sure!

11:42.301 --> 11:43.268
Who won the last game?

11:44.336 --> 11:44.995
Look!

11:45.171 --> 11:45.603
Master.

11:47.339 --> 11:47.930
Don't you remember?

11:49.008 --> 11:51.533
The contour here is not round enough.

11:51.844 --> 11:52.970
See the cheeks.

11:53.379 --> 11:54.903
And the winkles!

11:55.247 --> 11:56.612
This must be the
"Kwan Wan Cheung Lion"!

11:56.849 --> 11:58.282
Do you see what I mean?

11:59.652 --> 12:03.383
Uncle, Master Wong, they're coming.

12:03.889 --> 12:04.913
Your son's arrived.

12:05.458 --> 12:05.890
He's here?

12:06.092 --> 12:07.650
No, it's a bunch of hooligans

12:07.827 --> 12:08.816
looking for a fight.

12:09.795 --> 12:13.162
What's that? We're an association.
not a martial arts' club.

12:13.432 --> 12:14.899
What could they want with us?

12:15.468 --> 12:20.167
Stop your game!

12:21.474 --> 12:23.066
Stop your game, you got that?

12:25.878 --> 12:30.406
Pull down the lion heads.

12:31.884 --> 12:33.613
Listen up!
Now listen carefully.

12:33.853 --> 12:36.651
I say it like it is,
my name's Chiu Tim ba.

12:37.022 --> 12:40.389
I've met with all the martial arts'
clubs in the district.

12:40.726 --> 12:43.923
We agree I should represent
the district

12:44.096 --> 12:45.529
at the Lion King Competition.

12:45.865 --> 12:48.265
Therefore only the men from the
Tai ping oil factory may take part.

12:48.534 --> 12:49.933
That means you can forget

12:50.269 --> 12:52.396
all of these preparations.

12:53.372 --> 12:54.862
If you enter the competition,

12:55.608 --> 12:57.872
it's the end of your association.

12:58.410 --> 13:02.210
If you enter the competition
against my advice

13:02.448 --> 13:06.009
this could turn into
a school for cripples.

13:08.254 --> 13:10.848
I hope I've made everything
quite clear.

13:13.526 --> 13:15.721
You are not holding the competition.

13:15.961 --> 13:16.950
How can you set rules for it?!

13:17.730 --> 13:20.290
So you'd prefer a competition
with no rules then?

13:20.633 --> 13:21.361
OK, we'll thrash your place.

13:22.001 --> 13:22.399
Come on!

13:31.844 --> 13:33.072
You old fool, I'll slap your face!

13:45.124 --> 13:47.183
Young boy, I'll teach you a lesson.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.865
Help Uncle out here.

13:56.101 --> 13:56.590
Yes, sir!

13:57.069 --> 13:58.661
What is it? Shit!

14:10.883 --> 14:11.679
Iron Foot!

14:12.785 --> 14:13.444
Yes, boss.

14:27.633 --> 14:28.759
Step aside, don't get too close.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.036
Out of my way!

14:33.005 --> 14:33.801
I'll kill him!
You're all useless!

14:34.874 --> 14:38.503
I'm the head rickshaw puller
Iron Foot!

14:38.811 --> 14:39.607
Now it's my turn.

14:41.580 --> 14:42.945
Master! Master!
Stand back. Move!

15:14.713 --> 15:15.839
The ancestral lion.

15:19.118 --> 15:21.143
Master!

15:21.754 --> 15:22.277
Stand back!

15:36.902 --> 15:37.869
Amazing!

15:50.582 --> 15:51.412
Wonder Kick!

15:58.991 --> 16:00.424
Iron Foot, you're a dead man!

16:12.838 --> 16:13.930
Get him!

16:15.307 --> 16:15.796
Good work!

16:16.942 --> 16:19.172
Smash the lions!

16:23.849 --> 16:25.077
Here we are, home at last.

16:26.218 --> 16:27.116
13th Aunt, be careful.

16:31.090 --> 16:31.556
Go on, get out of here!

16:34.526 --> 16:37.893
What are you staring at?

16:39.965 --> 16:40.590
Hey, watch it!

16:41.767 --> 16:42.927
13th Aunt, it's just over there.

16:47.306 --> 16:49.866
Please take this, the lion head...

16:57.449 --> 16:58.347
Tidy up.

16:58.384 --> 16:59.316
Fei hung, what the...?

17:01.687 --> 17:02.210
Something's wrong.

17:04.990 --> 17:05.648
Master Wong, are you hurt?

17:05.924 --> 17:07.550
I'm all right.

17:07.693 --> 17:08.215
Dad!

17:09.560 --> 17:11.222
Fei hung, you're here!

17:11.430 --> 17:12.488
What happened?

17:12.731 --> 17:15.928
It's nothing really.
There was a fight.

17:16.167 --> 17:17.430
I'll be fine in a moment.

17:17.569 --> 17:18.536
Were they causing trouble?

17:18.837 --> 17:19.997
Did you report it?

17:21.173 --> 17:22.538
Who is this foreign woman?

17:22.840 --> 17:24.205
That's 13th Aunt.

17:24.576 --> 17:26.567
13th Aunt?

17:28.614 --> 17:30.411
She looks so funny!

17:30.616 --> 17:31.139
Dad...

17:33.519 --> 17:34.543
Stop laughing,

17:34.720 --> 17:36.210
it's making you cough.

17:36.722 --> 17:37.882
OK, I'll stop.

17:45.030 --> 17:46.258
Dad!

17:46.465 --> 17:48.330
You can stop laughing now.
I've changed my dress, all right?

17:48.500 --> 17:49.057
Stop laughing!

17:49.234 --> 17:51.828
All right, I'll stop laughing,

17:59.178 --> 18:01.738
Uncle Wong, Fei hung came

18:02.014 --> 18:03.709
to see your new factory.

18:04.483 --> 18:07.714
But he also wanted to talk about
getting married.

18:09.755 --> 18:10.779
Fei hung wants to get married?

18:13.926 --> 18:16.793
Do you know who my future
daughter in law is?

18:17.629 --> 18:20.063
I think he ought to tell you himself.

18:22.000 --> 18:22.830
That rascal! Why on earth

18:23.102 --> 18:26.094
didn't he bring her to meet me?

18:26.672 --> 18:27.070
Foon. I chose two

18:27.339 --> 18:29.307
long sharp weapons for you.

18:29.708 --> 18:31.938
Thanks a lot.
I'll teach you to defend yourselves.

18:31.977 --> 18:32.341
Good...

18:33.011 --> 18:34.945
Why won't Master Wong
let us get revenge?

18:35.180 --> 18:36.306
He's strange like that.

18:36.482 --> 18:39.042
He won't let us start a fight.

18:39.551 --> 18:41.416
He says kung fu's for the health,

18:41.620 --> 18:44.418
but when there's a fight,
he's the first to jump in.

18:44.556 --> 18:47.150
And he always enjoys the fight,
much more than we do.

18:48.393 --> 18:48.859
you ready?

18:49.061 --> 18:49.584
Ready!

18:50.329 --> 18:50.920
Come on!
Right.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.065
Foon, were you planning
on going somewhere?

19:02.474 --> 19:03.270
Master...

19:05.477 --> 19:07.809
It's just that the boys here said
as it's my first time here

19:08.080 --> 19:12.278
they'd take me out to eat ah...

19:12.417 --> 19:14.351
some... prawn dumplings.

19:14.887 --> 19:17.617
Really?
Are the prawns as eager as you?

19:18.090 --> 19:19.785
Yeah, yeah.

19:19.925 --> 19:22.189
You just had dinner.
Why do you want to eat prawns?

19:22.528 --> 19:24.962
Since when did you eat so much?

19:25.130 --> 19:25.858
Come over here, all of you.

19:44.016 --> 19:44.880
All right, sit down.

19:46.518 --> 19:47.177
Go on.

20:01.099 --> 20:02.657
Foon, you too.

20:03.368 --> 20:04.892
I sat all day on the train yesterday.

20:05.103 --> 20:06.900
I'd rather stand, if you don't mind.

20:08.173 --> 20:09.231
We're always blamed by our Government

20:09.508 --> 20:11.738
for forming schools which

20:12.144 --> 20:14.339
they say disturb the public order.

20:14.947 --> 20:16.346
That's why we must be careful.

20:16.949 --> 20:19.281
We must inform the authorities
of any disputes.

20:19.851 --> 20:21.045
We mustn't become involved.

20:21.820 --> 20:24.653
We have to look after the association

20:25.190 --> 20:26.953
and not let them cause trouble again.

20:29.595 --> 20:29.993
Foon!

20:30.128 --> 20:30.457
Yes.

20:31.129 --> 20:33.154
Look at them, they're slouching
all over the place.

20:33.632 --> 20:35.327
You must teach them correct posture.

20:36.468 --> 20:37.628
What? Me?!

20:41.206 --> 20:42.571
But it's so difficult.

20:43.408 --> 20:44.033
Fists in!

20:45.110 --> 20:46.168
Knees out!

20:46.478 --> 20:47.843
Breathe!

20:48.046 --> 20:49.013
Bend!

20:53.785 --> 20:54.979
Stop hitting me!

20:57.155 --> 21:01.819
and you'll copy it out.

21:05.764 --> 21:08.289
Who chose these weapons for me?

21:09.134 --> 21:09.566
Fei hung.

21:12.537 --> 21:14.664
Your father knows
you're hiding something.

21:18.277 --> 21:21.007
Why don't you go
and talk to him? Go on.

21:23.081 --> 21:24.946
Dad, I made you some herbal tea.

21:25.717 --> 21:27.981
Let me help you get up.

21:28.487 --> 21:30.079
I want to talk to you, son.

21:30.422 --> 21:31.184
Drink it.

21:32.424 --> 21:34.790
Thanks, but I don't want any.

21:35.560 --> 21:36.026
What? You don't want it?

21:36.628 --> 21:37.458
I know it's really troublesome.

21:38.230 --> 21:39.788
Here, look at this.

21:40.098 --> 21:43.067
It's a new preparation
from my Bo Chi Lam medicine factory.

21:43.402 --> 21:46.098
It's wonderful for cleaning out
the system.

21:46.371 --> 21:48.271
It could even save a person's life
in an emergency.

21:48.473 --> 21:51.670
I don't need herbal tea any more.

21:51.943 --> 21:53.035
I see.

21:53.912 --> 21:55.436
There are so many quacks around
these days.

21:55.747 --> 21:58.341
If we can produce this
in large quantities

21:58.583 --> 22:01.711
I'm sure people will buy it,
don't you think?

22:01.853 --> 22:03.115
Yeah...

22:04.289 --> 22:05.256
How am I going to get out
of this one?

22:05.457 --> 22:09.291
I've even bought a steam engine
to ensure output.

22:09.861 --> 22:11.556
I'm not feeling very well these days.

22:12.164 --> 22:16.533
You can go to the factory
to see it for yourself tomorrow.

22:17.135 --> 22:19.126
You'll look after it for me, right?

22:19.371 --> 22:20.804
Yeah, right.

22:23.942 --> 22:25.341
The herbal tea, son.
What are you doing?

22:26.712 --> 22:29.340
You're not drinking it.
I didn't want to waste it.

22:29.648 --> 22:32.549
Son, you came back this time to tell

22:33.085 --> 22:35.815
me something important, didn't you?

22:40.225 --> 22:40.714
Did I?

22:41.360 --> 22:43.692
Well, don't you know
your own mind?

22:44.830 --> 22:45.159
Go on, tell me

22:45.530 --> 22:47.862
what you have to tell me.

22:50.369 --> 22:53.031
Nothing!
What? Nothing?

22:54.439 --> 22:56.999
I must let this tea cool down.
It's too hot.

22:58.243 --> 23:00.575
You stupid idiot.

23:09.588 --> 23:13.217
"Bo Chi Lam Medicine Factory"

23:18.296 --> 23:21.129
This thing looks like a train.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.124
So this is the mighty steam engine?

23:23.835 --> 23:27.327
Yes. British industry is ahead of
the rest of the world's economy

23:27.539 --> 23:31.202
all due to Mr. Watt's invention
the steam engine.

23:32.544 --> 23:35.980
You mean a guy
called "What" invented this?!

23:36.748 --> 23:39.512
What industry? What economy?

23:40.185 --> 23:42.449
Master Wong, welcome.

23:43.321 --> 23:45.255
And it's just the steam
that drives everything?

23:45.824 --> 23:46.756
It's that powerful?

23:47.058 --> 23:50.755
Sure, but other things are
as powerful, like my emotions.

23:51.029 --> 23:54.055
When I'm worked up I can move faster
than any steam engine.

23:54.533 --> 23:58.663
Yes, all that movement
at the window confused me.

23:58.837 --> 24:00.566
I was so busy watching you,
I forgot what I was going to say.

24:00.972 --> 24:03.497
What good is a steam engine
that doesn't move?

24:03.642 --> 24:06.167
That's the whole point of it, right?

24:06.411 --> 24:07.036
It's a steam engine.

24:07.279 --> 24:09.042
We're not talking about that.

24:10.148 --> 24:11.274
You're not?

24:24.296 --> 24:26.093
Goodness, you'd better bring
some of our new medicine here.

24:26.264 --> 24:27.322
Look at his face.

24:27.566 --> 24:30.763
it's been scalded by the steam engine.

24:31.002 --> 24:32.560
No, I'm fine, I'm all right.

24:32.704 --> 24:34.171
He wasn't scalded by this steam.

24:34.406 --> 24:36.567
It was another engine last night.

24:38.109 --> 24:40.771
That was quick. You've never
been that quick at your kung fu.

24:42.447 --> 24:43.436
Calm down.

24:48.253 --> 24:51.313
Hey, everyone,
there's another fight outside.

24:51.656 --> 24:54.750
Those martial artists have
come to pick on us again.

25:00.866 --> 25:03.460
The Pak Mai School
The Chiu School

25:04.002 --> 25:05.094
What's this all about?

25:05.871 --> 25:07.463
The Lion King Competition, what else?

25:08.473 --> 25:13.410
The Tam School
The Chiu School
The Pak Mai School

25:13.478 --> 25:14.638
If this carries on.

25:14.813 --> 25:15.609
Someone will get hurt.

25:15.814 --> 25:18.282
They already have been.
This is their third fight.

25:18.817 --> 25:20.045
I'm going to put a stop to it.

25:20.252 --> 25:22.345
Master, wait!

25:25.357 --> 25:26.756
Can he handle them all by himself?

25:27.158 --> 25:30.389
I don't know. I become very anxious
every time he gets involved.

25:31.296 --> 25:33.958
Go and find some men
to help him, hurry up!

25:41.473 --> 25:42.269
Fools!

25:44.075 --> 25:46.270
Drop your weapons. Stop fighting!

26:36.695 --> 26:38.993
You're disturbing the peace.
Stop fighting!

26:41.866 --> 26:42.696
Who is in charge?

26:43.668 --> 26:45.192
I want to speak to your leader.

26:50.475 --> 26:52.340
I see, the Tam
and the Chiu schools...

26:52.944 --> 26:56.880
and the Pak Mai school.
You're all martial artists.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.576
What brings you here causing trouble?

27:00.619 --> 27:01.313
Who are you?

27:03.288 --> 27:06.621
My name is Wong Fei hung.

27:07.158 --> 27:10.093
I ask you honestly, can't you settle
your differences without fighting?

27:11.730 --> 27:13.994
The Tams and Chius
have joined forces against us.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.400
They needed more pupils for
the competition

27:16.701 --> 27:18.931
so they stole mine.

27:21.006 --> 27:23.099
We should classify the grade
of kung fu through fighting

27:23.541 --> 27:25.031
The pupils know
who teaches better kung fu.

27:25.243 --> 27:27.438
Those who came, came willingly.
They weren't forced.

27:27.879 --> 27:29.938
You're from the Chiu, so get lost.

27:30.048 --> 27:31.515
To hell with you!
We are the Tams!

27:31.750 --> 27:35.151
Go on, then, show us!
I'm not afraid of you.

27:35.286 --> 27:37.117
Calm down, please, gentlemen.

27:37.422 --> 27:39.754
Might I suggest you fight me instead?

27:40.025 --> 27:41.788
We'll see who gives
the best performance.

27:42.427 --> 27:44.520
Are you on their side
or on mine? Well?

27:45.230 --> 27:48.256
I just want to be fair. Please.

27:49.634 --> 27:53.900
Him first.
Let's see how good he is!

27:54.305 --> 27:55.772
Right. I'll go first.

28:01.312 --> 28:01.801
Come on!

28:10.288 --> 28:11.016
Master!

28:11.756 --> 28:14.088
Master Wong, thank you.

28:15.293 --> 28:16.692
Sorry about that kick.

28:17.128 --> 28:19.187
That was quick!

28:21.066 --> 28:22.158
All right, my turn.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.801
We risk being ridiculed here.

28:28.940 --> 28:31.033
Master Wong,
we cede to your greater wisdom.

28:31.976 --> 28:34.774
I'm glad to see I've made you realise
fighting's useless.

28:35.046 --> 28:38.982
I'd like to invite you all
to dinner tonight.

28:39.217 --> 28:41.151
I'll be there on time.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.248
So will I.

28:44.089 --> 28:45.021
"San Shiu Restaurant"

28:46.424 --> 28:47.584
Hey, look, it's Master Wong.

28:48.059 --> 28:49.048
Master Wong...

28:49.327 --> 28:51.227
Good evening, good evening.

28:52.731 --> 28:55.256
Please, sit.
Thank you.

28:59.070 --> 29:01.698
Master Lee, I'm so glad
you're here tonight.

29:10.248 --> 29:12.716
What is it?
What on earth are you doing here?

29:13.551 --> 29:16.281
I just wondered
why these broken heads were here.

29:17.088 --> 29:19.682
These lion heads
were used by our ancestors.

29:19.924 --> 29:23.621
Although they're broken now,
we can't bear to throw them away.

29:26.197 --> 29:29.724
I was told that our ancestors won
a lot of competitions in the past.

29:30.335 --> 29:32.997
That's right.

29:33.438 --> 29:34.996
They risked their lives for
each of these heads you see here.

29:35.540 --> 29:37.906
But it was only
for the glory of it all.

29:45.784 --> 29:48.753
This Lion King Competition
is causing a lot of trouble.

29:49.420 --> 29:52.651
I think we should
notify the authorities.

29:54.392 --> 29:55.791
We could tell them,

29:56.127 --> 29:58.561
but I don't think
they could do anything to stop it.

29:58.997 --> 30:02.433
It's been organised by governor Li
on behalf of the empress.

30:02.867 --> 30:03.424
So what?

30:03.968 --> 30:06.232
We could present a petition signed by
all the kung fu schools.

30:06.371 --> 30:07.929
We'll tell her the truth

30:08.506 --> 30:10.201
about what's happening.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.303
What do you think?

30:13.211 --> 30:15.702
I haven't really thought of that.

30:15.880 --> 30:17.370
It doesn't seem right.

30:17.916 --> 30:20.248
This is urgent.
We have to take action quickly.

30:20.752 --> 30:22.413
Mr. Wai, some paper.

30:22.821 --> 30:23.913
Yes, sir.

30:25.023 --> 30:26.547
Thanks for coming here.

30:27.759 --> 30:31.593
May all our schools work side by side
to promote martial arts

30:32.030 --> 30:35.932
and let's present our petition
to governor Li together.

30:36.568 --> 30:37.034
Yes, right.

30:39.704 --> 30:43.333
Cheers.

30:53.318 --> 30:55.081
"Wu Gate"

31:00.992 --> 31:02.584
Good morning, sir.
Good morning.

31:03.127 --> 31:05.425
A petition for the governor

31:05.663 --> 31:06.857
signed by the city's 14 kung fu schools.

31:10.034 --> 31:10.432
Sir.

31:12.203 --> 31:13.170
I'll see that he gets it.

31:13.471 --> 31:14.665
Thank you, sir.

31:15.740 --> 31:17.731
Governor Li.

31:18.076 --> 31:21.443
Master Wong represents
the city's 14 martial arts schools.

31:22.013 --> 31:26.177
I have more important things to do.
Give it to one of my secretaries.

31:26.384 --> 31:27.180
Yes, of course, sir.

31:27.552 --> 31:29.645
As if I had time for such trifles.

31:31.289 --> 31:31.653
Sir?

31:32.357 --> 31:34.757
It takes time to process an enquiry,

31:34.993 --> 31:36.017
you won't get an immediate response.

31:36.194 --> 31:37.661
Thanks very much.

31:37.795 --> 31:38.352
It's a pleasure.

31:38.696 --> 31:39.219
Goodbye, sir.

31:44.502 --> 31:45.833
Let's go!

31:54.579 --> 31:55.546
So when will we get a reply?

31:56.481 --> 32:00.941
We just have to wait until it
comes... if it ever does come.

32:03.855 --> 32:05.322
I have to do something.

32:06.224 --> 32:10.092
Master, a rickshaw?
Here you go. Where to?

32:10.428 --> 32:11.861
The Cantonese Consulate.

32:12.664 --> 32:13.153
Come on.

32:15.266 --> 32:17.791
Here, Master, get in. Where to?

32:17.969 --> 32:18.492
Follow that rickshaw.

32:18.736 --> 32:21.296
You're Cantonese?
Yes.

32:24.342 --> 32:26.435
Hey! You're not following
the rickshaw.

32:27.545 --> 32:29.035
Fei hung!
13th Aunt!

32:32.917 --> 32:34.407
Iron Foot! Come on!

32:37.088 --> 32:37.850
Fei hung!

32:40.491 --> 32:41.890
I'm here!

32:45.930 --> 32:46.658
Wong Fei hung!

32:49.167 --> 32:50.429
Cut him off at the East Gate!

33:08.619 --> 33:10.314
Fei hung, Fei hung!

33:39.217 --> 33:40.206
Come out, Wong Fei hung!

33:41.919 --> 33:43.352
Don't hide like a coward!

33:46.324 --> 33:48.315
Wong Fei hung!
I'm not Wong Fei hung!

33:54.132 --> 33:55.224
Wong Fei hung is right here!

34:11.983 --> 34:12.847
Let me go!

34:28.166 --> 34:29.292
Watch out! The woman!

34:31.002 --> 34:34.460
Get out of the way! Move it! Move!

34:38.743 --> 34:40.141
So you're Wong Fei hung?

34:41.612 --> 34:42.135
Master!

34:44.916 --> 34:48.147
I say it like it is,
my name is Chiu Tim ba.

34:48.652 --> 34:50.621
Judging by the way you fought

34:51.022 --> 34:52.114
Iron Foot, your kung fu's excellent.

34:52.489 --> 34:55.014
I could use you
in the Lion King Competition.

34:55.626 --> 34:58.618
That's if you're willing
to join my Tai ping lion team.

34:59.730 --> 35:02.790
Name your price.
I'm a generous employer.

35:03.501 --> 35:06.527
Competing for money alone
is no competition at all.

35:07.205 --> 35:09.332
If you want fighters,
you look elsewhere.

35:10.441 --> 35:13.376
As for your competition,
I'll never enter.

35:14.378 --> 35:17.939
In that case, as you're not my ally,
you're my enemy!

35:18.749 --> 35:20.148
If you refuse to join the Tai ping,

35:20.318 --> 35:21.876
you shall die.

35:22.920 --> 35:23.614
Go to hell!

35:40.771 --> 35:41.430
Master!

35:41.672 --> 35:42.195
Let me go!

35:42.673 --> 35:43.435
My horse!

35:45.109 --> 35:46.542
Hurry up, come and help her!

35:50.381 --> 35:51.507
Tomansky! Please, can you help us?

35:51.682 --> 35:53.115
We're being attacked.

35:54.152 --> 35:54.709
Don't worry.

35:55.453 --> 35:56.249
Surround him!

35:56.454 --> 35:57.819
You want to escape?

35:58.022 --> 35:58.750
Out of my way!

36:01.125 --> 36:02.956
Wong Fei hung,
so you're afraid of me.

36:05.329 --> 36:06.023
Iron Foot!

36:07.798 --> 36:08.730
Don't worry, I'm here.

36:10.034 --> 36:11.092
Be careful!

36:11.836 --> 36:12.860
I'm just in time.

36:13.938 --> 36:15.098
Stop, I know him.

36:17.141 --> 36:20.702
I'm very sorry, but it's not
our custom to kiss a man's hand.

36:20.978 --> 36:21.603
You needn't worry.

36:22.046 --> 36:24.344
It's not our custom
to let our hands be kissed.

36:24.849 --> 36:26.111
You've kissed both of our hands.

36:26.617 --> 36:28.141
but I'll ask you not to do it again.

36:28.352 --> 36:31.185
It's a disgusting habit. Understood?

36:31.756 --> 36:32.586
Iron Foot, well done!

36:32.790 --> 36:33.882
He was kicked!

36:34.091 --> 36:36.389
He's really no good at all!

36:36.661 --> 36:37.093
Bravo!

36:37.295 --> 36:38.853
Fei hung, did that man kick you?

36:39.630 --> 36:40.790
It was no big deal.

36:41.098 --> 36:42.030
I was more worried about your hand...

36:42.667 --> 36:44.396
which has been taken
advantage by others

36:44.869 --> 36:46.336
Don't be ridiculous.

36:46.637 --> 36:49.504
Mr. Wong, why don't you forget
the rickshaws and take my carriage?

36:49.707 --> 36:50.503
We'll be back. Just you wait!

36:51.475 --> 36:52.772
Be careful...

36:53.744 --> 36:56.110
That's very kind,
but we can make our own way.

36:56.214 --> 36:59.240
No, for safety's sake it would
be best to take the carriage.

36:59.483 --> 37:00.415
Come on.

37:01.285 --> 37:01.944
Excuse me.

37:06.691 --> 37:07.623
Aren't you coming?

37:09.961 --> 37:10.689
No. I'll walk.

37:11.395 --> 37:13.260
Driver, the Cantonese consulate.

37:13.497 --> 37:14.395
Go on!

37:17.602 --> 37:18.159
Fei hung!

37:19.737 --> 37:21.728
Sir, your carriage waits.

37:22.240 --> 37:22.865
Please.

37:24.342 --> 37:25.604
Follow that carriage.

37:32.283 --> 37:34.751
We've been here all day.
It's taking too long.

37:38.222 --> 37:38.711
Master Wong!

37:38.956 --> 37:40.355
Master, you're back!

37:40.625 --> 37:42.115
13th Aunt's making a movie.

37:42.293 --> 37:42.952
Master Wong!

37:43.227 --> 37:45.627
She wanted to film you,
but they couldn't wait

37:45.830 --> 37:47.092
so we started without you.

37:47.298 --> 37:48.196
It's really funny.

37:48.532 --> 37:49.897
Old Master Wong's in it too.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.625
But she can't film everybody,

37:51.902 --> 37:53.369
so she chose the seniors.

37:53.604 --> 37:54.662
Do you feel better now?

37:54.872 --> 37:55.463
I need more rest.

37:55.706 --> 37:56.400
Moving pictures?

37:56.707 --> 37:59.198
That's right.

37:59.443 --> 38:00.740
It's not like photographs,
it takes motion pictures.

38:01.178 --> 38:02.702
Motion pictures?!
See?

38:03.581 --> 38:06.049
Master, why don't you try it?
Do I have to?

38:06.284 --> 38:08.514
Fei hung, you'll love it
when people watch your film.

38:08.753 --> 38:09.811
Go on. Master.

38:10.021 --> 38:10.953
Go on.

38:11.956 --> 38:13.719
We can learn kung fu from your films.

38:16.694 --> 38:17.854
No, you're too close to the camera.

38:19.563 --> 38:22.031
Move back, I can't get all of you.

38:23.334 --> 38:23.959
That's fine.

38:24.168 --> 38:25.100
The pictures will move?

38:25.202 --> 38:28.899
Yes!
Right. Ready?

38:30.274 --> 38:31.366
What?

38:34.078 --> 38:37.172
Didn't you hear, action?!

38:37.581 --> 38:40.106
That's what they say before filming.

38:40.418 --> 38:40.884
Then?

38:41.285 --> 38:43.378
Action means you start moving.
It means she's started filming.

38:45.456 --> 38:47.686
You're not like this normally.

38:47.892 --> 38:49.723
You always have quick reactions!

38:50.394 --> 38:51.520
We want some action. Go on.

38:53.397 --> 38:54.193
I know exactly what to do, thank you.

38:56.867 --> 38:57.959
Why do I bother?

38:58.269 --> 39:00.635
The camera's rolling now. Action!

39:25.363 --> 39:26.887
Where did you get that?

39:29.834 --> 39:33.895
We've only just arrived. You couldn't
have ordered it in such a short time.

39:35.072 --> 39:38.007
The Russian you met in the railway
station had it delivered here.

39:38.743 --> 39:39.675
What?

39:45.349 --> 39:46.145
Master Wong!

39:50.087 --> 39:52.112
Fei hung! He wasn't asking you!

39:53.624 --> 39:55.524
What's he up to?

40:02.333 --> 40:05.461
Fei hung?
Are you angry with me?

40:08.672 --> 40:10.162
I've repaired your jacket.

40:21.685 --> 40:23.778
Are you really that angry with me?

40:25.489 --> 40:27.821
I know you don't like Tomansky.

40:28.025 --> 40:31.290
But I never saw a camera before.

40:31.629 --> 40:33.096
I wanted to see what films are like.

40:33.297 --> 40:34.958
They may be very important in future.

40:35.466 --> 40:36.626
We have to learn about new things

40:37.301 --> 40:39.235
in case we need to use them one day.

40:44.508 --> 40:47.443
So everything new is useful,
you make me sound old fashioned.

40:48.512 --> 40:49.308
Please don't be like this.

40:49.713 --> 40:51.408
If you really don't like that Russian,

40:52.783 --> 40:55.217
I'll never see him again.

40:55.786 --> 40:56.912
Are you still angry with me now?

40:58.255 --> 40:59.222
Are you still angry?

41:01.959 --> 41:02.687
13th Au...

41:03.127 --> 41:05.061
No, I mean Peony.

41:12.837 --> 41:14.065
For the wedding arrangements,

41:14.705 --> 41:16.138
you should talk to your father.

41:16.574 --> 41:18.337
We shouldn't waste time.

41:19.109 --> 41:20.133
I'll talk to him.

41:23.113 --> 41:24.512
But I have to think of a good way
of telling him

41:24.849 --> 41:26.407
so he'll be pleased.

41:26.717 --> 41:28.776
Or you'll say I'm an idiot.

41:32.890 --> 41:33.686
Master, Are you still angry?

41:33.958 --> 41:35.482
Son, hurry up!

41:35.726 --> 41:36.852
Others want to be filmed...

41:37.027 --> 41:37.516
Old Master, look!

41:38.696 --> 41:39.128
Master!

41:39.396 --> 41:42.297
Why were you sitting so close?

41:44.068 --> 41:46.127
13th Aunt had something in her eye,
I was taking it out.

41:46.570 --> 41:49.471
Really? 13th Aunt, I'm an expert,

41:49.707 --> 41:50.173
I'll take it out for you.

41:50.374 --> 41:51.841
No thanks, it's done already.

41:52.476 --> 41:53.909
Dad, let's go finish the movie.

41:54.078 --> 41:55.238
Good idea.

41:56.247 --> 41:57.544
Cut that out!

42:00.384 --> 42:03.478
Master! I think
there's something in my eye.

42:03.687 --> 42:05.314
Could you get it out for me?

42:06.957 --> 42:07.787
I don't have time!

42:07.958 --> 42:10.483
Why has everyone got something
in their eyes?

42:11.395 --> 42:13.260
13th Aunt.
we need you for the camera.

42:46.630 --> 42:48.621
Master Wong, this is a good position.

42:48.899 --> 42:50.298
All the lions pass by here.

42:50.534 --> 42:51.466
You can also see the trophy here.

42:51.669 --> 42:53.364
It's a specially designed trophy.

42:53.637 --> 42:54.365
Really?

42:54.572 --> 42:55.129
Yes...

44:32.870 --> 44:35.430
Those lion heads
are different to the usual.

44:36.240 --> 44:37.935
Yes, before the Lion King
Competition starts

44:38.108 --> 44:41.669
they're settling a few old scores.

44:42.780 --> 44:44.179
The four main triads in the city

44:44.415 --> 44:44.938
the White Lotus.

44:45.215 --> 44:46.182
the Tiger gang,

44:46.684 --> 44:48.117
the Black Dragons

44:48.919 --> 44:50.477
and the Tai ping oil factory

44:50.854 --> 44:53.152
they want to put the others
out of the running.

44:53.757 --> 44:55.691
So when the competition comes around,

44:55.926 --> 44:58.622
their rivals can't compete with them.

45:00.864 --> 45:02.729
They seem to have a lot of support.

45:02.933 --> 45:05.493
Yes, this gang here
belongs to Chiu Tim ba.

45:11.208 --> 45:12.402
They seem very sure of themselves.

45:18.315 --> 45:22.274
Here they come!

45:22.319 --> 45:23.786
Here they come!

45:47.211 --> 45:48.041
It looks like a lion race.

45:48.445 --> 45:50.140
but it's just a big fight.

45:51.682 --> 45:54.082
Be careful.
The steam engine's very hot.

45:54.318 --> 45:55.979
Your Master was scalded.

45:56.186 --> 45:57.346
It doesn't look hot.

45:57.554 --> 45:59.385
It's so hot.
you can cook your food on it.

46:00.090 --> 46:02.115
That's just what I'm going to do.

46:02.326 --> 46:05.386
These youngsters never listen.

46:07.364 --> 46:08.763
Let's cook some food, shall we?

46:14.571 --> 46:16.937
Brother Foon, we need your help
in the Lion Race.

46:18.475 --> 46:19.237
Really?
Yeah.

46:20.511 --> 46:23.344
Brother. Come on.
Hurry!

46:24.047 --> 46:24.911
Be quiet!

46:25.449 --> 46:27.178
If Master Wong finds out it's me...

46:27.718 --> 46:30.016
Thunderhead, he won't know
it's me under there!

46:30.554 --> 46:31.851
All right, let's do it!
Come on!

46:52.743 --> 46:53.437
Come over?

47:16.300 --> 47:17.028
Him again!

47:18.502 --> 47:19.833
I didn't invite him.

47:20.037 --> 47:21.436
but he wants to come over.

47:22.005 --> 47:22.767
Since he's here.

47:23.774 --> 47:24.832
we'll give him back his camera.

47:25.209 --> 47:26.073
I'll buy another one.

47:27.344 --> 47:29.869
But they're not easy to find here.

47:30.314 --> 47:31.110
Are you sure?

47:32.583 --> 47:33.675
We'll find one soon.

47:35.452 --> 47:36.714
Where have they put the trophy?

47:36.920 --> 47:38.182
It's about four blocks down.

47:38.355 --> 47:40.915
Really?!
No wonder I can't see it now!

47:41.124 --> 47:41.954
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

47:42.326 --> 47:44.851
Hurry, we're still a long way away.

48:44.254 --> 48:44.720
Foon!

48:44.888 --> 48:45.377
What's up?

48:45.555 --> 48:46.078
We'll never catch them.

48:46.390 --> 48:47.482
So we should just give up?

48:47.791 --> 48:49.156
Where is your courage?

48:49.326 --> 48:50.122
Come on!

48:51.328 --> 48:52.420
Let me see where the trophy is.

48:53.864 --> 48:54.523
It's Iron Foot.

48:55.899 --> 48:56.490
Are you sure?

48:56.600 --> 48:58.431
Yes, see that lion with the knives?

49:03.573 --> 49:05.006
Brother Foon, he's very cocky.

49:08.045 --> 49:10.536
Right, we can't win,
but we can stop him.

49:10.747 --> 49:12.271
Yeah. Let's take the short cut.

49:21.992 --> 49:23.118
Iron Foot, take that!

49:24.061 --> 49:25.255
What's up?

49:25.762 --> 49:26.319
Nothing.

49:30.233 --> 49:30.858
Cut it out!

49:33.403 --> 49:34.028
And another kick!

49:34.671 --> 49:35.695
What are you doing?

49:35.939 --> 49:36.530
He kicked me!

49:39.843 --> 49:41.208
Look out! He's coming!

49:41.578 --> 49:42.408
Go to hell!

49:43.280 --> 49:44.247
I'll break your lion head.

49:45.782 --> 49:46.510
Where did Iron Foot go?

49:46.717 --> 49:48.207
He's right behind us. This way!

49:48.685 --> 49:50.277
You're not the lion head.

49:51.588 --> 49:53.180
You're even quicker than me!

50:11.575 --> 50:12.405
It's coming near.

50:15.912 --> 50:18.176
It's coming up here! Run!

50:18.982 --> 50:19.880
Fei hung, look there.

50:24.688 --> 50:26.553
Peony, come on.

50:26.923 --> 50:28.754
Don't use his ladder, this way.

50:31.661 --> 50:31.956
Hold on tight.

50:32.162 --> 50:32.628
Are you quite sure?

50:33.096 --> 50:34.120
All Right.

50:45.308 --> 50:46.275
My camera!

50:52.349 --> 50:52.838
Are you all right?

50:53.016 --> 50:53.744
Get my camera.

50:54.017 --> 50:55.450
Of course.
We still have to return it.

51:14.104 --> 51:15.867
It's Wong, go get rid of him.

51:16.206 --> 51:16.638
Get him!

51:17.040 --> 51:18.234
Right!

51:53.877 --> 51:55.344
Damn you! Who the hell are you?

51:57.814 --> 51:58.405
Yan!

51:58.982 --> 52:00.279
Forget about me, get out of here!

52:00.750 --> 52:01.239
OK.

52:03.820 --> 52:06.050
Bastard, I'm going to kill you.

53:23.633 --> 53:25.066
Who the hell are you?
Come out!

53:30.440 --> 53:32.237
Iron Foot, you can call me Daddy.

53:35.712 --> 53:37.646
Iron Foot be a good boy now,

53:37.814 --> 53:38.712
Daddy said so.

53:42.819 --> 53:43.786
Go to hell!

53:53.163 --> 53:54.528
You can't do this! I'm your dad!

54:00.470 --> 54:01.960
Take that. Dad!

54:33.937 --> 54:35.802
You son of a bitch!

56:52.509 --> 56:54.977
I've got it! I've got it!
We've won the competition!

56:57.414 --> 57:00.440
Stupid idiot! Get that trophy!

57:00.750 --> 57:03.446
Get it back!
Come on, get it back!

57:09.692 --> 57:14.288
I've got it! The Tai ping
have won the competition.

57:16.699 --> 57:17.358
Here. Master.

57:19.335 --> 57:20.893
The winners!
The Tai ping Team

57:27.310 --> 57:30.507
Good! The Tai ping team
is the greatest of them all!

57:30.980 --> 57:33.005
We'll celebrate with a big banquet.

57:33.483 --> 57:36.077
And I'll be giving you all a reward

57:36.286 --> 57:37.981
for proving your loyalty to me!

57:44.694 --> 57:45.661
Loser!

57:48.598 --> 57:49.223
13th Aunt?

58:10.086 --> 58:10.643
My camera.

58:12.856 --> 58:13.288
Peony!

58:15.124 --> 58:15.988
Fei hung!

58:17.227 --> 58:18.023
Why are you so scared?

58:20.063 --> 58:21.223
Something strange is going on.

58:22.232 --> 58:23.256
Did you see something?

58:23.700 --> 58:26.032
Whatever it was. I missed it.

58:36.846 --> 58:38.871
Fortunately we found out just in time
that he was a double agent.

58:40.283 --> 58:46.916
There was no other choice.
We had to get rid of him.

58:46.990 --> 58:51.620
He planned to reveal the plans we
made for the Lion King Competition.

58:54.864 --> 59:00.166
Governor Li Hung chang is planning to
cede Liaodong Peninsula to Japan.

59:00.670 --> 59:06.575
If this happens, war between Russia
and Japan will be unavoidable.

59:07.944 --> 59:13.348
In one month, governor Li will be
preparing to sign the agreement.

59:14.617 --> 59:19.554
To prevent this,
we have to get rid of the governor.

59:20.423 --> 59:23.586
Listen carefully,
this word is wo man.

59:24.227 --> 59:24.921
Wo what?

59:25.595 --> 59:27.290
Wu mung.

59:29.198 --> 59:32.759
Just think of mung beans.

59:33.102 --> 59:33.966
What does it mean?

59:35.538 --> 59:36.630
This word is difficult to pronounce.

59:36.806 --> 59:37.898
I'll teach you a simple one Man.

59:38.441 --> 59:39.465
Me.

59:39.742 --> 59:41.471
Me?

59:42.111 --> 59:44.443
That sounds like the word me.

59:44.647 --> 59:46.478
Why are you teaching me that?

59:47.183 --> 59:48.172
You don't understand.

59:48.217 --> 59:49.980
This is female, this is male.

59:50.153 --> 59:51.415
So it's woman and man.

59:51.588 --> 59:53.249
It's bothering, man... woman...

59:53.423 --> 59:54.617
Teach me something useful,

59:54.991 --> 59:55.958
something I can say in an emergency.

59:57.093 --> 59:57.889
In an emergency?

01:00:00.163 --> 01:00:01.892
All right,
here's something for an emergency.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:04.796
Help!

01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:05.796
That's not helpful.

01:00:06.269 --> 01:00:07.327
You never know.

01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:10.471
Come on, I've never called for help.

01:00:10.707 --> 01:00:11.935
It's not a useful word for me.

01:00:12.175 --> 01:00:13.506
Teach me something
I can use every day.

01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:15.067
All right.

01:00:17.413 --> 01:00:18.641
I love you.

01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:21.512
I love you?
What does it mean?

01:00:22.018 --> 01:00:23.451
You say it when I come to visit you

01:00:23.686 --> 01:00:26.587
or when I'm leaving.

01:00:27.123 --> 01:00:32.390
I guess it could be useful.
I love you.

01:00:32.428 --> 01:00:34.191
Once more.

01:00:34.864 --> 01:00:36.263
I love you.

01:00:36.499 --> 01:00:37.625
And with my name.

01:00:38.201 --> 01:00:39.964
13th Aunt, I love you.

01:00:40.136 --> 01:00:40.727
Without the 13th Aunt.

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:42.999
Peony, I love you.

01:00:43.439 --> 01:00:44.497
I love you, too.

01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:47.940
Why do you say it like that?

01:00:48.978 --> 01:00:49.706
It's just an exercise.

01:00:51.047 --> 01:00:51.911
Once more, I love you.

01:00:52.181 --> 01:00:53.113
I love you.

01:00:53.282 --> 01:00:58.686
I love you.
I love you.

01:00:58.821 --> 01:00:59.947
Foreigners are really strange,

01:01:00.156 --> 01:01:02.249
they seem to use some words
over and over again.

01:01:02.525 --> 01:01:04.356
They must like the word love a lot.

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:08.293
I love you.

01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:09.597
Peony, I love you.
13th Aunt!

01:01:14.237 --> 01:01:17.434
Master. I need to talk to 13th Aunt.

01:01:17.707 --> 01:01:19.265
Of course, but when you greet someone

01:01:19.842 --> 01:01:21.810
you have to say I love you.

01:01:21.978 --> 01:01:22.501
What?

01:01:22.745 --> 01:01:23.871
Just repeat after me,

01:01:24.113 --> 01:01:25.705
I love you.

01:01:26.582 --> 01:01:28.550
This is English. Go on.

01:01:28.885 --> 01:01:34.790
13th Aunt.

01:01:35.458 --> 01:01:36.390
That sentence was for your master,

01:01:36.592 --> 01:01:38.560
you can't use it on me, understood?

01:01:40.196 --> 01:01:42.426
Fei hung, I'd like to talk to you.

01:01:42.632 --> 01:01:43.360
Would you come outside with me?

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:44.727
Dad, when you come to see me,

01:01:44.934 --> 01:01:46.834
you have to say I love you.

01:01:47.103 --> 01:01:48.035
Come again?

01:01:48.204 --> 01:01:49.000
I love you.

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:51.840
I love you.
Right!

01:01:52.308 --> 01:01:55.436
13th Aunt, excuse me,
we need to talk.

01:01:55.712 --> 01:01:57.646
We can do some more later.

01:01:58.047 --> 01:01:58.809
Come on, let's go out.

01:01:59.182 --> 01:02:01.480
I'm thinking of making
some tablets...

01:02:01.584 --> 01:02:03.518
13th Aunt, I love you.

01:02:03.686 --> 01:02:04.584
Be quiet!

01:02:04.921 --> 01:02:05.580
The tablets!

01:02:05.788 --> 01:02:07.551
There's something I want
to talk to you about too, Dad.

01:02:08.124 --> 01:02:09.216
Could you do me a favour?

01:02:09.959 --> 01:02:10.516
What is it?

01:02:11.094 --> 01:02:12.493
The steam engine's broken down.

01:02:12.795 --> 01:02:13.887
Can you find someone to fix it?

01:02:15.598 --> 01:02:16.929
Why don't you tell the old master?

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:18.167
He bought it.

01:02:18.534 --> 01:02:20.092
He can get it repaired.

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:23.030
I can't do that!
If the old master finds out

01:02:23.272 --> 01:02:24.705
he'll tell my master.

01:02:24.941 --> 01:02:26.806
If my master knows that, I...

01:02:28.845 --> 01:02:31.245
I'll try and find someone, OK?

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:31.971
It has to be quick.

01:02:32.281 --> 01:02:34.374
Dad, there's something
I need to tell you.

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:35.551
Sure, why don't we sit down.

01:02:36.385 --> 01:02:37.010
What is it?

01:02:37.453 --> 01:02:38.511
Well...

01:02:40.389 --> 01:02:41.287
Well, I want to get...

01:02:41.557 --> 01:02:44.458
Don't worry. 13th Aunt's
told me all about your plans.

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:45.557
She told you?

01:02:45.795 --> 01:02:46.454
And it's all right.

01:02:46.729 --> 01:02:49.527
We both agree with your decision.

01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:52.230
I'm sure you've made
the right decision.

01:02:52.468 --> 01:02:54.800
I was so afraid to tell you.

01:02:54.971 --> 01:02:57.235
Why be afraid?

01:02:57.874 --> 01:03:00.502
Getting married
is a normal thing for a man.

01:03:00.676 --> 01:03:02.541
Then I'll make arrangements.

01:03:02.678 --> 01:03:03.474
Good. You do that.

01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:08.141
Fei hung, tell me, what's the name
of the bride to be?

01:03:10.186 --> 01:03:10.880
13th Aunt.

01:03:12.889 --> 01:03:13.378
Are you all right?

01:03:15.191 --> 01:03:17.455
Dad. Dad!

01:03:18.995 --> 01:03:20.121
Dad, are you all right?

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:22.723
So what other tablets

01:03:22.899 --> 01:03:23.729
did you want to produce?

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:28.103
Tablets...

01:03:29.305 --> 01:03:31.933
I'll get you a cup of tea
to calm you down.

01:03:32.708 --> 01:03:35.268
Fei hung, Fei hung, I love you.

01:03:37.947 --> 01:03:39.574
It's 13th Aunt.

01:03:40.883 --> 01:03:46.344
That means Fei hung
will be my nephew in law.

01:03:48.024 --> 01:03:51.255
What a mess we're in.

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:52.957
What mess?

01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:08.468
I was told that Iron Foot's injury
couldn't be cured.

01:04:09.245 --> 01:04:09.711
Excuse me.

01:04:10.246 --> 01:04:13.147
Wait, wait, give me that!

01:04:13.983 --> 01:04:14.972
If he's of no use any more,

01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:18.210
then he can take off, it's that simple.

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:21.881
Go on, it's your turn!

01:04:22.091 --> 01:04:23.888
Master Chiu, it's your turn.

01:04:24.227 --> 01:04:25.353
Yes! I know it's my turn, you idiots.

01:04:25.628 --> 01:04:27.027
Come on, guys,

01:04:28.364 --> 01:04:30.832
Master Chiu will take care of you.

01:04:33.402 --> 01:04:34.767
Come and earn some money.

01:04:42.011 --> 01:04:43.273
Who the hell are you? Piss off!

01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:52.110
Let's see you block my kick now,

01:04:53.122 --> 01:04:54.783
Iron Foot!

01:04:56.592 --> 01:04:59.060
Damn! Another one
of these useless counters!

01:04:59.328 --> 01:05:00.352
Where's your Wonder Kick now?
Come on.

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:02.027
You're not like this normally,
where's your courage?

01:05:02.798 --> 01:05:03.890
Do you need a hand?

01:05:06.869 --> 01:05:09.497
Wait a sec. I've won!

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:15.372
May I help you?

01:05:18.381 --> 01:05:19.473
Go to hell!

01:05:25.187 --> 01:05:27.246
You're too slow.

01:05:27.423 --> 01:05:28.048
I need to make money, come on!

01:05:29.792 --> 01:05:30.315
Damn you cripple!

01:05:48.344 --> 01:05:49.641
I win again!

01:05:50.146 --> 01:05:52.774
Can't you get up?
I'll get your reward for you.

01:06:09.932 --> 01:06:12.457
Be careful. Can you see all right?

01:06:13.602 --> 01:06:16.435
I think it's all right now, yeah?

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:18.570
That should do it.

01:06:24.847 --> 01:06:27.213
Take this.
Thanks.

01:06:28.517 --> 01:06:29.415
It just needs a few taps here.

01:06:37.326 --> 01:06:37.951
Fei hung?

01:06:39.595 --> 01:06:41.893
I thought you promised me
you'd never see him again.

01:06:43.432 --> 01:06:46.424
I needed his help
to repair the steam engine.

01:06:46.902 --> 01:06:48.563
So it's broken. I don't care!

01:06:48.771 --> 01:06:49.533
Wong Fei hung!

01:06:49.772 --> 01:06:50.431
Master!

01:06:52.174 --> 01:06:53.835
Your views are old fashioned.

01:06:54.677 --> 01:06:57.009
You shouldn't underestimate
the steam engine.

01:06:57.380 --> 01:07:01.441
It can make your factory
more efficient

01:07:01.784 --> 01:07:03.911
and do things
that are impossible for humans.

01:07:04.887 --> 01:07:07.378
Steam is the force
behind the industrial revolution.

01:07:08.424 --> 01:07:10.415
Whoever can master steam

01:07:10.793 --> 01:07:12.260
will be the masters of the world.

01:07:12.895 --> 01:07:15.295
The industrialists
will be the new emperors.

01:07:16.132 --> 01:07:17.997
Both Russia and China

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:20.361
must adapt to the new ways.

01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:24.004
If this is the way forward,

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.070
I'll face the reality then.

01:07:25.641 --> 01:07:28.474
We'll see if humans or machines
will have the last word.

01:07:34.784 --> 01:07:35.409
Fei hung!

01:07:35.785 --> 01:07:37.218
He's really angry now.

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:38.209
Fei hung!

01:07:42.725 --> 01:07:45.660
13th Aunt!

01:07:48.664 --> 01:07:53.533
Fei hung!

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:56.466
Iron Foot?

01:08:01.877 --> 01:08:04.710
"The All Powerful Cantonese Lions"

01:08:15.891 --> 01:08:16.413
Wong Fei hung?

01:08:19.528 --> 01:08:20.085
It's all right.

01:08:21.063 --> 01:08:21.620
Are you all right?

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:23.754
13th Aunt!

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:24.661
You ungrateful bastard!

01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:25.765
Foon!

01:08:26.734 --> 01:08:27.359
Don't touch me!

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:30.997
Iron Foot, your leg is badly injured.

01:08:31.439 --> 01:08:34.102
If you don't let me help you,
you'll be crippled for life.

01:08:35.277 --> 01:08:37.575
Wong Fei hung, why don't you
save your pity?

01:08:37.813 --> 01:08:38.575
Leave me be!

01:08:40.749 --> 01:08:41.511
Be careful!

01:08:45.254 --> 01:08:45.912
Iron Foot.

01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:53.395
Come on, why don't you
let us help you?

01:08:55.598 --> 01:08:56.758
Let's go back inside.

01:08:57.933 --> 01:08:58.627
You ungrateful bastard!

01:08:59.001 --> 01:09:00.696
Go to hell!

01:10:09.004 --> 01:10:10.028
Come on. Iron Foot.

01:10:10.272 --> 01:10:11.136
Leave me!

01:10:17.413 --> 01:10:18.380
Your leg can't get wet.

01:10:28.857 --> 01:10:29.824
Look, if you want to fight me,

01:10:30.125 --> 01:10:31.251
wait till you're better.

01:10:38.567 --> 01:10:41.092
Wong Fei hung!

01:11:11.433 --> 01:11:13.958
Glad you could come!

01:11:14.169 --> 01:11:15.796
Great to see you!

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:17.163
Lovely to see you, sir.

01:11:17.406 --> 01:11:18.304
Thank you.

01:11:19.208 --> 01:11:21.335
Good evening, sir.

01:11:39.028 --> 01:11:43.863
Fei hung, I had no idea
you could move that fast.

01:11:44.066 --> 01:11:46.364
That's why they say you can kick
faster than your shadow.

01:11:47.636 --> 01:11:48.625
I didn't know I was that fast.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:52.534
Foon!

01:12:13.462 --> 01:12:18.764
Why has it stopped?

01:12:38.053 --> 01:12:39.111
It's Brother Foon!

01:12:39.288 --> 01:12:40.482
You're right.

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:06.704
It's very quick and confusing.

01:13:07.449 --> 01:13:08.916
You OK?

01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:13.980
It's on fire!

01:13:14.356 --> 01:13:15.084
Can someone put out the fire?

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:21.256
How come it's burning?

01:13:21.563 --> 01:13:22.928
Film is highly flammable.

01:13:23.298 --> 01:13:24.697
Then you'd better never
use film again.

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:28.498
Out of the way!

01:13:28.804 --> 01:13:29.566
Wong Fei hung!

01:13:30.672 --> 01:13:32.162
Chiu Tim ba? What does he want?

01:13:35.944 --> 01:13:40.540
Don't be scared.
I'm looking for a friend of mine.

01:13:40.749 --> 01:13:41.374
I'm going to kill you!

01:13:41.583 --> 01:13:42.277
Get the weapons.

01:13:42.551 --> 01:13:45.042
I've looked after him for many years,

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:47.311
but now he's here with you

01:13:47.489 --> 01:13:49.389
so I've come to take him back.

01:13:51.026 --> 01:13:51.822
You're the one that abandoned him.

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:53.561
Foon!

01:13:55.898 --> 01:13:58.696
Chiu Tim ba. I'd rather
we were friends than enemies.

01:13:59.468 --> 01:14:00.196
I've treated his wound.

01:14:00.769 --> 01:14:03.932
if he wants to return, then it's his choice.

01:14:05.507 --> 01:14:08.908
You can't say fairer than that.
That's most noble of you.

01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:09.903
Wong Fei hung,

01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:13.138
I really admire your character.

01:14:13.382 --> 01:14:14.713
To prove my goodwill, I'm arranging
a banquet tomorrow night

01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:17.248
for you and your father.

01:14:17.486 --> 01:14:19.454
Please come.

01:14:20.889 --> 01:14:22.754
I just want to say sorry.

01:14:23.859 --> 01:14:25.952
Fine, we'd be delighted to attend.

01:14:26.495 --> 01:14:28.690
Great, that's what I appreciate in a person,

01:14:28.931 --> 01:14:30.728
the ability to forgive.

01:14:30.933 --> 01:14:32.924
Tomorrow night, the San Shui Restaurant,
and don't be late.

01:14:33.368 --> 01:14:37.304
Thank you, Master.

01:14:37.606 --> 01:14:39.801
Thank you.

01:14:40.642 --> 01:14:43.110
Goodbye, Master.

01:14:43.245 --> 01:14:45.304
And thank you once again.

01:14:47.983 --> 01:14:50.713
We'll set an example for the rest
of the kung fu schools.

01:14:50.919 --> 01:14:52.682
See you tomorrow night!

01:14:54.223 --> 01:14:56.623
See you.

01:15:01.296 --> 01:15:01.955
Master.

01:15:02.798 --> 01:15:04.959
Iron Foot.
I can't refuse the invitation.

01:15:05.567 --> 01:15:07.865
Nobody must leave
the building tonight.

01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:09.799
Foon, take care of security.

01:15:10.205 --> 01:15:10.830
Security?

01:15:11.306 --> 01:15:12.273
I will go to the restaurant,

01:15:12.975 --> 01:15:14.465
you take care of this place.

01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:17.270
Fei hung, I intend going with you.

01:15:18.046 --> 01:15:18.444
Dad...

01:15:19.648 --> 01:15:21.377
I'm not going to let you go alone.

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:23.511
Didn't you hear him say
I was invited?

01:15:23.886 --> 01:15:25.319
I'm going with you.

01:15:26.755 --> 01:15:27.722
We'll go together.

01:15:28.257 --> 01:15:29.189
Of course.

01:15:30.125 --> 01:15:32.423
When things get tough,

01:15:32.928 --> 01:15:35.556
we have to stick together.

01:15:46.842 --> 01:15:47.934
Master's leaving now.

01:15:48.176 --> 01:15:50.371
Last night was quiet,
but we have to be more careful.

01:15:50.779 --> 01:15:53.179
You two, the back door.
you three, the front door.

01:15:53.582 --> 01:15:55.140
You two, cover the yard.

01:15:55.684 --> 01:15:56.514
You three, take the street.

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:00.954
Iron Foot, you take the roof
and the side gate.

01:16:01.757 --> 01:16:04.157
Hey, Foon,
how can I watch both places?

01:16:04.459 --> 01:16:06.950
Your leg could do with the exercise.

01:16:07.629 --> 01:16:08.095
Oh. I see.

01:16:08.463 --> 01:16:10.192
Yan, get some water ready.

01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:11.297
But I've had my bath.

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:13.559
Not for bathing, in case of fire!
Oh, right.

01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:16.901
Hey, Foon, have you seen Fei hung?

01:16:17.372 --> 01:16:18.202
No. I haven't.

01:16:19.575 --> 01:16:21.304
He left without me.

01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:26.709
Chiu Tim ba, here I am.

01:16:27.683 --> 01:16:29.514
Master Wong,
I'm glad you could make it.

01:16:29.718 --> 01:16:32.983
You're most welcome.

01:16:33.188 --> 01:16:33.847
This way please.

01:16:35.123 --> 01:16:37.683
I'm sure you'll like the food
and the young ladies.

01:16:37.926 --> 01:16:39.518
Ladies? I don't know about that.

01:16:39.795 --> 01:16:40.318
OK, then.

01:16:41.163 --> 01:16:42.095
We'll give that a miss.

01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:42.719
Please, sit.

01:16:42.864 --> 01:16:43.592
Sit...

01:16:47.336 --> 01:16:50.828
Master Wong, I know you'll join me
in a toast to peace.

01:16:51.173 --> 01:16:51.605
See...

01:16:51.873 --> 01:16:54.569
I've prepared
the finest wine for you.

01:16:55.611 --> 01:16:56.737
Here's to peace.

01:16:58.847 --> 01:17:00.781
I'd also like to offer our respects

01:17:01.016 --> 01:17:03.109
to the great martial arts' heroes.

01:17:03.652 --> 01:17:05.119
We are merely carrying on

01:17:05.354 --> 01:17:07.686
the great traditions they founded.

01:17:09.658 --> 01:17:10.147
Cheers.

01:17:19.868 --> 01:17:21.165
What's this?

01:17:23.205 --> 01:17:23.762
Wong Fei hung,

01:17:23.939 --> 01:17:25.907
I invited you and your father,
yet you came alone.

01:17:26.108 --> 01:17:28.235
That proves you are not sincere.

01:17:28.543 --> 01:17:30.602
What's more
you assaulted one of my men.

01:17:31.079 --> 01:17:33.377
You just want to humiliate me.

01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:36.282
You attacked my father,

01:17:36.752 --> 01:17:39.084
yet I came here tonight
out of respect for you.

01:17:39.621 --> 01:17:41.521
We live in a country
where law and order prevails.

01:17:42.257 --> 01:17:43.246
So I'm going to turn you in.

01:17:44.593 --> 01:17:45.321
Really?

01:17:45.761 --> 01:17:48.889
And you honestly think you'll manage
to evade this little trap?

01:17:49.297 --> 01:17:51.060
You're a better fighter
than I imagined.

01:17:51.633 --> 01:17:53.726
I'm afraid this is your last supper.

01:17:53.969 --> 01:17:56.062
Now I'm going to send you to hell!

01:17:56.838 --> 01:17:57.429
Go ahead.

01:17:59.875 --> 01:18:02.571
I'd like to see you try.

01:18:03.912 --> 01:18:05.743
Go on, I'm waiting.

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:10.382
Well, wait no longer.

01:18:11.186 --> 01:18:12.448
A simple trick, try this for size!

01:18:15.824 --> 01:18:16.756
You won't succeed.

01:18:18.794 --> 01:18:19.852
Don't waste any more time.

01:18:21.596 --> 01:18:22.187
Get him!

01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:36.268
Oil?

01:18:36.445 --> 01:18:38.709
Of course!
After all, it is in our factory.

01:18:39.214 --> 01:18:42.081
We'll see how good your skills are
when things are slippery underfoot.

01:18:42.317 --> 01:18:44.649
Go to hell!

01:18:56.031 --> 01:18:57.555
Put the table here.

01:18:57.833 --> 01:18:59.357
We can play a little game
and watch the show.

01:19:07.876 --> 01:19:09.241
Chop him into little pieces!
Well done!

01:19:46.681 --> 01:19:48.444
You don't escape that easy!

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:46.236
Are we having fun yet?

01:21:06.461 --> 01:21:09.828
I'm gonna die!

01:21:12.801 --> 01:21:13.392
You're still alive.

01:21:14.603 --> 01:21:15.194
Master Wong.

01:21:18.039 --> 01:21:18.630
Get lost.

01:21:30.285 --> 01:21:30.774
Stand firm!

01:21:44.232 --> 01:21:44.926
I've lost!

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:46.990
Wong Fei hung!

01:21:49.104 --> 01:21:51.004
Chiu Tim ba! Stop!

01:21:51.973 --> 01:21:52.871
Fei hung, are you all right?

01:21:53.074 --> 01:21:53.733
Fine. Come on.

01:21:57.012 --> 01:21:57.808
Where are you going?

01:21:58.046 --> 01:21:58.705
Please spare me.

01:21:58.947 --> 01:22:00.847
I know I've done wrong,
but please spare me, sir.

01:22:01.049 --> 01:22:03.643
I'm begging you.

01:22:03.818 --> 01:22:06.946
You should have
thought of that before.

01:22:07.255 --> 01:22:08.415
Look out! He knows kung fu.

01:22:09.224 --> 01:22:10.088
How dare you are!

01:22:13.929 --> 01:22:15.487
I'm going to dig out your eyeballs.

01:22:27.909 --> 01:22:28.375
Iron Foot!

01:22:28.843 --> 01:22:31.038
Well, it seems your leg's better.

01:22:37.719 --> 01:22:40.187
Wong Fei hung, it will take
more than you to stop me.

01:22:40.488 --> 01:22:42.820
Your kung fu is very average.

01:22:46.094 --> 01:22:48.426
Master, how can you stand this?

01:22:49.898 --> 01:22:52.366
Right, get after him.

01:22:52.567 --> 01:22:53.329
Right.

01:22:56.972 --> 01:22:59.497
But like you say,
we'd better stay calm.

01:24:24.492 --> 01:24:25.049
What's that?

01:24:30.298 --> 01:24:31.322
13th Aunt's suitcase.

01:24:34.836 --> 01:24:38.499
13th Aunt...

01:24:44.012 --> 01:24:46.105
13th Aunt's gone. Where did she go?

01:24:46.481 --> 01:24:46.970
We must find her.

01:24:47.715 --> 01:24:48.181
Gone?

01:24:51.653 --> 01:24:52.347
13th Aunt!

01:24:54.255 --> 01:24:54.949
Check that side.
Right.

01:25:05.967 --> 01:25:06.490
Fei hung.

01:25:08.236 --> 01:25:09.260
Aunt...

01:25:10.371 --> 01:25:11.201
Peony!

01:25:19.447 --> 01:25:20.243
You didn't leave.

01:25:44.405 --> 01:25:47.499
Say something. This kind
of behaviour is hardly fitting.

01:25:48.243 --> 01:25:51.542
I say that we should throw away
the old lion heads.

01:25:52.147 --> 01:25:55.446
They're outdated,
they're no use any more.

01:25:57.318 --> 01:25:59.684
Lion heads? I don't get it.

01:26:04.392 --> 01:26:07.190
Peony, I thought you'd left forever.

01:26:09.063 --> 01:26:11.463
Yes, there's something important
I have to show you.

01:26:12.233 --> 01:26:12.858
Follow me.

01:26:39.827 --> 01:26:41.385
What did he stuff in the wall?

01:26:42.197 --> 01:26:45.496
I went back to that place
and I found this.

01:26:50.338 --> 01:26:53.364
At the Lion competition,
when the firecracker explodes

01:26:53.775 --> 01:26:55.402
kill Li Hung chang.

01:26:56.544 --> 01:26:58.739
I knew that Russian
was up to no good!

01:26:59.047 --> 01:27:00.810
We must inform
His Excellency at once.

01:27:01.382 --> 01:27:03.247
But he may not want to see us.
Then what?

01:27:03.952 --> 01:27:04.543
Are you asking me?

01:27:04.886 --> 01:27:06.444
It's a matter of life and death!
Be serious!

01:27:29.244 --> 01:27:30.609
We have to save Governor Li.

01:27:31.312 --> 01:27:33.246
We must stop the explosion from happening.

01:27:33.848 --> 01:27:35.748
Who knows what disorder might follow?

01:27:36.217 --> 01:27:38.583
Of course, we can't involve
the association.

01:27:39.454 --> 01:27:42.719
To solve this problem,
I shall go in myself.

01:28:28.336 --> 01:28:30.429
The camera team. Let them through.

01:28:30.538 --> 01:28:31.937
Let's go.

01:28:35.443 --> 01:28:37.138
Master, I can't see the trophy.

01:28:37.879 --> 01:28:40.541
That's because it's hidden inside
that huge lantern there.

01:28:41.049 --> 01:28:42.778
When the governor lights it,

01:28:43.117 --> 01:28:44.414
it will rise up.

01:28:44.986 --> 01:28:48.353
The lion grabs it and the firecracker
underneath goes off.

01:28:48.823 --> 01:28:49.847
You'll have to be careful.

01:28:50.091 --> 01:28:52.685
That's when the assassination
is due to happen.

01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:53.383
Got that?

01:28:53.661 --> 01:28:54.355
Got it. Master.

01:28:57.098 --> 01:29:01.000
His Excellency, governor Li.

01:29:08.576 --> 01:29:10.737
Sir, the foreigners are saluting you.

01:29:12.246 --> 01:29:14.544
Very good.

01:29:25.226 --> 01:29:25.851
Your Excellency.

01:29:52.754 --> 01:29:54.153
The film.
Give it to me.

01:30:21.182 --> 01:30:22.046
Now.

01:30:28.489 --> 01:30:29.547
Foon, Iron Foot, let's go!

01:30:43.805 --> 01:30:44.464
Climb over the top!

01:30:45.139 --> 01:30:45.764
Yes. Master!

01:30:59.754 --> 01:31:02.689
Foon! Stand on my shoulders.

01:31:03.891 --> 01:31:04.414
You're learning fast.

01:31:04.926 --> 01:31:05.858
Iron, look behind you.

01:31:07.061 --> 01:31:08.358
Right, let's get moving.

01:31:14.268 --> 01:31:16.236
Master, Iron can't keep up with us.

01:31:16.871 --> 01:31:17.769
Yes. I can.

01:31:22.577 --> 01:31:23.236
Who's that?

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:33.014
Pyramid.

01:31:35.723 --> 01:31:36.485
Iron Foot, don't move.

01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:39.688
Let's get them.

01:31:41.662 --> 01:31:42.185
Kick the head.

01:31:50.104 --> 01:31:51.332
Be careful! Head for the tower.

01:31:51.672 --> 01:31:52.934
I'm fine, but I'm worried
about Iron Foot.

01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:20.164
Watch out for the hammers!

01:32:21.302 --> 01:32:22.064
I'm trying to!

01:33:12.119 --> 01:33:13.211
Master, did you see that?

01:33:13.688 --> 01:33:15.212
Why are you so excited? Be careful!

01:33:52.994 --> 01:33:54.393
Master, I've been injured.

01:34:04.071 --> 01:34:04.765
Forget about me.

01:34:05.706 --> 01:34:07.697
Master, where's Foon?

01:34:08.576 --> 01:34:10.009
He's injured.
See if you can help him.

01:34:11.679 --> 01:34:13.271
Right. Get out of my way.

01:34:13.414 --> 01:34:16.850
Brother Foon!
I'm here, on my back!

01:34:21.722 --> 01:34:23.519
On your right. Now your left!

01:34:24.358 --> 01:34:25.325
Behind you!

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:27.593
Foon seems to be injured.

01:34:28.462 --> 01:34:29.019
Brother Foon!

01:34:29.163 --> 01:34:30.391
Hey, Yan!

01:34:30.531 --> 01:34:31.759
Don't be an idiot, come back here.

01:34:32.299 --> 01:34:35.700
Yan, you forgot to bring
the medicine chest.

01:34:36.504 --> 01:34:37.698
Come back here!

01:34:46.947 --> 01:34:48.676
The camera is pointed this way.

01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:51.681
It could ruin all our plans.
I'll go and check.

01:34:51.819 --> 01:34:52.911
Yes.

01:34:58.492 --> 01:35:00.289
That Russian's coming.
What will we do?

01:35:00.728 --> 01:35:01.285
I'm going.

01:35:01.896 --> 01:35:02.419
And me?

01:35:02.630 --> 01:35:03.494
Watch things here.

01:35:03.864 --> 01:35:04.660
Yeah, right.

01:35:05.866 --> 01:35:06.764
Be careful, daughter.

01:35:07.201 --> 01:35:08.099
Don't worry, Uncle.

01:35:08.903 --> 01:35:09.460
Daughter?!

01:35:12.773 --> 01:35:14.764
Why is she still calling me Uncle?

01:35:17.745 --> 01:35:19.007
Brother, are you all right?

01:35:19.447 --> 01:35:20.744
Sure, go and help Master.

01:35:21.215 --> 01:35:22.079
Sure, take care.

01:35:22.450 --> 01:35:23.849
Leave the flag here.

01:35:24.118 --> 01:35:25.483
He's still not experienced enough.

01:37:04.952 --> 01:37:07.477
Peony, why were you
filming us earlier?

01:37:09.456 --> 01:37:11.287
What's wrong?
Do you have something to hide?

01:37:12.459 --> 01:37:13.653
What exactly do you know?

01:37:15.029 --> 01:37:15.996
We both know what's going on here.

01:37:28.209 --> 01:37:28.971
Here I come!

01:37:34.682 --> 01:37:35.307
Chiu Tim ba!

01:37:37.251 --> 01:37:41.187
Wong Fei hung, I'm going to be
the champion.

01:37:41.455 --> 01:37:42.149
Get him!

01:37:47.595 --> 01:37:48.118
Let's go.

01:37:52.633 --> 01:37:55.363
So simple!
We nearly have the trophy. Come on!

01:37:56.704 --> 01:37:58.399
Chiu Tim ba, stop dreaming!

01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:02.000
Wong Fei hung,
I'm going to devour your lion.

01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:13.245
I'll bite you to death!

01:38:15.155 --> 01:38:16.782
No way.

01:38:21.929 --> 01:38:22.861
Kill him!

01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:44.649
Tell them that I want a good fight,

01:38:45.019 --> 01:38:47.078
but no killing.

01:38:56.864 --> 01:38:58.297
I'll swallow you!

01:39:17.418 --> 01:39:18.885
Wong Fei hung, you won't beat me.

01:39:19.053 --> 01:39:19.951
Smash the tower!

01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:28.660
Master, I'll help you.

01:39:30.331 --> 01:39:31.025
Grab the tail.

01:39:42.276 --> 01:39:44.301
Iron Foot, we have to stop
the big lion.

01:39:44.478 --> 01:39:44.944
OK!

01:39:45.879 --> 01:39:46.607
Surround them.

01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:53.982
Iron Foot, roll over!

01:39:54.488 --> 01:39:55.011
Got it.

01:40:03.630 --> 01:40:05.495
Iron Foot, the big lion, let's go!

01:40:05.632 --> 01:40:06.462
OK!

01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:21.409
Keep them away from our lion!

01:40:22.883 --> 01:40:23.508
The tower, come on!

01:40:29.089 --> 01:40:29.851
Give me a banner!

01:40:40.067 --> 01:40:40.499
Be careful!

01:40:44.538 --> 01:40:45.368
Master, what now?

01:41:05.526 --> 01:41:07.824
The Russian and 13th Aunt!
There must be something wrong.

01:41:08.028 --> 01:41:10.019
Master, here I come!

01:41:24.278 --> 01:41:26.246
Master, that lion is trying to
knock down the tower!

01:41:29.416 --> 01:41:31.247
Look out! Here comes Chiu himself!

01:41:51.338 --> 01:41:53.806
You stupid idiot!
Why didn't you get out of the way?

01:41:57.845 --> 01:41:58.777
Master, there's one more!

01:41:59.313 --> 01:42:01.645
I'll try to smash the lion head.

01:42:10.224 --> 01:42:11.213
Master, let me!

01:42:13.427 --> 01:42:14.325
And another one!

01:42:28.442 --> 01:42:30.467
Destroy the tower!

01:42:48.896 --> 01:42:50.329
That camera was a gift from me.

01:42:52.499 --> 01:42:54.160
Now I'm asking you to return it.

01:42:57.471 --> 01:42:57.994
Give it back!

01:43:00.374 --> 01:43:01.102
A medicine chest?

01:43:03.243 --> 01:43:04.403
It was a decoy.

01:43:11.418 --> 01:43:14.080
Why did you betray me?

01:43:15.055 --> 01:43:15.885
I didn't betray you.

01:43:16.590 --> 01:43:19.081
The camera betrayed you
when it filmed you.

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:21.187
Peony, I can't let you go!

01:43:21.361 --> 01:43:23.829
Even if you stop me,
your plan cannot succeed any more.

01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:30.960
Do you remember what I once told you?
You have to go with the changes.

01:43:31.605 --> 01:43:35.041
Years ago, the Hans detested
being ruled by the Manchus.

01:43:35.209 --> 01:43:36.471
And now you're used to it.

01:43:37.544 --> 01:43:38.408
In 200 years time,

01:43:39.046 --> 01:43:41.139
you'll be used to
being ruled by foreigners.

01:43:41.615 --> 01:43:42.843
China should be ruled by Chinese.

01:43:43.383 --> 01:43:45.544
We have to work out our own problems.

01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:48.188
We don't need you foreigners
getting involved.

01:43:49.823 --> 01:43:51.051
I'm afraid I'll have to kill you.

01:43:57.764 --> 01:44:00.062
13th Aunt!

01:44:00.601 --> 01:44:01.795
13th Aunt, don't worry...

01:44:02.102 --> 01:44:02.659
Don't move!

01:44:02.869 --> 01:44:03.665
Brother Foon, I'll save you!

01:44:04.838 --> 01:44:05.361
Go away.

01:44:05.872 --> 01:44:06.770
I'll save you.

01:44:07.507 --> 01:44:09.236
Cut it out! I'm better at saving.

01:44:09.409 --> 01:44:10.034
Don't worry.

01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:11.306
Stop arguing.

01:44:14.781 --> 01:44:15.247
What now?

01:44:16.216 --> 01:44:17.945
Cut the lantern's ribbon.

01:44:25.292 --> 01:44:26.520
Damn! This thing isn't steady.

01:44:41.408 --> 01:44:42.500
Iron, are you all right?

01:44:43.977 --> 01:44:45.740
Master, look, the lantern!

01:44:51.551 --> 01:44:52.017
Catch!

01:44:54.855 --> 01:44:56.379
Damn it!

01:44:57.958 --> 01:44:59.858
Master, you need a lion head.

01:45:00.027 --> 01:45:00.618
Quick, give it to me.

01:45:02.596 --> 01:45:03.563
I've got it.

01:45:04.731 --> 01:45:05.755
Iron Foot, catch.

01:45:05.832 --> 01:45:06.389
Right.

01:45:15.108 --> 01:45:15.938
Where did it go?

01:45:17.844 --> 01:45:18.776
It's stuck up there.

01:45:19.012 --> 01:45:22.573
Come on, let's get it.

01:45:25.919 --> 01:45:28.786
The firecracker's going to go off
any minute. What do I do?

01:45:58.085 --> 01:45:59.484
Bring that back here!

01:46:09.062 --> 01:46:10.586
Iron, throw me the lion head!

01:46:10.997 --> 01:46:11.759
Yes. Master!

01:46:22.576 --> 01:46:23.565
Don't move.

01:46:25.011 --> 01:46:25.500
Don't move.

01:46:25.679 --> 01:46:26.543
Drop it.

01:46:41.628 --> 01:46:42.492
Don't look!

01:46:54.341 --> 01:46:56.070
I wish your view of history
had been different

01:46:57.077 --> 01:46:58.772
but it's all too late now.

01:47:36.349 --> 01:47:39.944
Please stop!
Master Wong, please stop.

01:47:42.456 --> 01:47:43.445
If you kill me,

01:47:43.623 --> 01:47:46.387
hundreds of workers
at my factory will lose their jobs!

01:47:46.693 --> 01:47:49.059
Spare a thought
for all those poor workers.

01:47:52.132 --> 01:47:54.396
I've lost everything.
Give me a second chance.

01:47:55.101 --> 01:47:57.126
A second chance?! Forget it!

01:48:02.342 --> 01:48:04.810
Many people have suffered
because of the likes of you.

01:48:05.145 --> 01:48:07.705
Take him away
before I change my mind. Go on!

01:48:10.517 --> 01:48:13.953
Master, are you all right?

01:48:18.425 --> 01:48:20.188
Apparently the man they shot dead

01:48:20.393 --> 01:48:22.384
was a spy working for the Japanese.

01:48:22.596 --> 01:48:26.157
This proves what they have long
suspected about the man's identity.

01:48:26.733 --> 01:48:27.597
I see now.

01:48:27.934 --> 01:48:28.923
We should tell His Excellency.

01:48:30.704 --> 01:48:32.001
Thank you, sir.

01:48:34.508 --> 01:48:35.497
Iron Foot, the trophy!

01:48:35.775 --> 01:48:36.241
Yes!

01:48:37.978 --> 01:48:41.505
Your Excellency, the competition
is over. I hope you're satisfied.

01:48:42.849 --> 01:48:44.282
But unfortunately,

01:48:44.618 --> 01:48:46.813
the lantern was destroyed in the fight.

01:48:47.053 --> 01:48:49.453
And we cannot say
just who the winner is.

01:48:49.723 --> 01:48:52.191
I have the trophy.

01:48:52.559 --> 01:48:55.221
But who is the loser
and who is the winner?

01:48:55.729 --> 01:48:58.095
This Lion King Competition
has caused many deaths.

01:48:58.231 --> 01:49:01.223
We are all losers.

01:49:02.702 --> 01:49:06.035
In life the only ones who win
are the pure of heart

01:49:06.239 --> 01:49:09.208
and it's up to us to pass on
that message to all our people.

01:49:09.709 --> 01:49:12.610
Only the wisdom
and great courage of our people

01:49:12.812 --> 01:49:14.712
can make our country strong again.

01:49:17.217 --> 01:49:19.117
How much has this gold trophy

01:49:20.053 --> 01:49:21.884
really cost us?

01:49:22.088 --> 01:49:24.181
Perhaps Your Excellency
would consider that.

01:49:24.424 --> 01:49:26.824
I'll give the trophy to
Your Excellency as a souvenir.
