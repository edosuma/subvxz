DO YOU CONSIDER THIS
A SUCCESS, SIR?

21:03.929 --> 21:05.431
VERY MUCH SO.

21:05.514 --> 21:07.300
THE MAN VVAS CONFINED
ALONE IN A BOX

21:07.391 --> 21:10.349
FOR SOMETHING IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD OF 484 HOURS.

21:10.436 --> 21:12.848
THAT'S ROUGHLY EQUIVALENT
TO A TRIP TO THE MOON,

21:12.938 --> 21:14.599
SEVERAL ORBITS
AND RETURN.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.647
THEN THIS VVAS A SIMULATED
TRIP TO THE MOON?

21:16.734 --> 21:18.645
FOR ALL INTENT
AND PURPOSE, YES.

21:18.736 --> 21:21.319
<i>WHAT ABOUT THESE WIRES
ATTACHED TO HIM?</i>

21:21.405 --> 21:23.237
ELECTRODES.

21:23.324 --> 21:25.656
ALL OF HIS REACTIONS
WERE CHARTED AND GRAPHED.

21:25.743 --> 21:28.110
RESPIRATION, HEART
ACTION, BLOOD PRESSURE.

21:28.204 --> 21:30.536
<i>WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM
TOWARD THE END, GENERAL,</i>

21:30.623 --> 21:33.456
BEFORE HE PUSHED THAT
BUTTON, WHATEVER IT WAS?

21:33.542 --> 21:37.331
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM
IS THAT HE CRACKED.

21:37.421 --> 21:41.005
DELUSIONS OF SOME
KIND, WE ASSUME.

21:41.091 --> 21:44.129
BUT LET ME TELL YOU
ALL SOMETHING, GENTLEMEN.

21:44.220 --> 21:46.177
IF ANY ONE OF YOU VVERE
CONFINED IN A BOX

21:46.263 --> 21:49.346
<i>FNE FEET SQUARE FOR
TWO AND A HALF WEEKS</i>

21:49.433 --> 21:52.346
ALL BY YOUR LONESOME VVITHOUT
HEARING A HUMAN VOICE

21:52.436 --> 21:54.222
OTHER THAN YOUR OWN,

21:54.313 --> 21:56.350
I'LL GIVE YOU
ESPECIALLY GOOD ODDS

21:56.440 --> 21:59.523
THAT YOUR IMAGINATION VVOULD
RUN AVVAY VVITH YOU, TOO,

21:59.610 --> 22:00.941
SUCH AS HIS
OBVIOUSLY DID.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.313
EXCUSE ME.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.284
(colonel)
DETAIL.

22:13.958 --> 22:15.665
HOW DO YOU FEEL,
SERGEANT?

22:15.751 --> 22:17.287
<i>(Ferris) I FEEL
MUCH BETTER, SIR.</i>

22:17.378 --> 22:19.335
I'M SORRY ABOUT
TOWARD THE END.

22:19.421 --> 22:20.627
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

22:20.714 --> 22:22.170
WHAT WAS IT
LIKE, FERRIS?

22:22.258 --> 22:23.874
<i>WHERE DID YOU
THINK YOU WERE?</i>

22:23.968 --> 22:26.881
A PLACE I DON'T WANT
TO GO AGAIN, SIR.

22:26.929 --> 22:28.636
A TOWN.

22:28.722 --> 22:31.100
<i>A TOWN WITHOUT PEOPLE,
WITHOUT ANYBODY.</i>

22:31.183 --> 22:33.220
WHAT WAS THE MATTER
WITH ME, DOC?

22:33.310 --> 22:34.562
JUST OFF MY
ROCKER, HUH?

22:34.645 --> 22:36.101
JUST A KIND
OF A NIGHTMARE

22:36.188 --> 22:39.726
THAT YOUR MIND
MANUFACTURED FOR YOU.

22:39.817 --> 22:41.399
<i>YOU SEE, WE CAN
FEED THE STOMACH</i>

22:41.485 --> 22:43.192
WITH CONCENTRATES.

22:43.279 --> 22:46.067
WE CAN SUPPLY MICROFILM
FOR READING, RECREATION,

22:46.156 --> 22:48.568
EVEN MOVIES
OF A SORT.

22:48.659 --> 22:52.243
WE CAN PUMP OXYGEN IN
AND WASTE MATERIAL OUT.

22:52.329 --> 22:54.707
<i>BUT THERE'S ONE THING
WE CAN'T SIMULATE</i>

22:54.790 --> 22:57.782
<i>THAT'S A VERY
BASIC NEED--</i>

22:57.877 --> 23:00.244
MAN'S HUNGER
FOR COMPANIONSHIP.

23:00.337 --> 23:02.874
<i>THE BARRIER
OF LONELINESS--</i>

23:02.965 --> 23:05.548
<i>THAT'S ONE THING WE
HAVEN'T LICKED YET.</i>

23:05.634 --> 23:09.628
NEXT TIME, IT VVON'T BE JUST
A BOX IN A HANGAR, VVILL IT?

23:09.722 --> 23:11.679
NO, MIKE.

23:11.765 --> 23:14.097
NEXT TIME, YOU'LL
REALLY BE ALONE.

23:29.450 --> 23:33.444
HEY. DON'T GO
AWAY UP THERE.

23:33.537 --> 23:37.622
<i>NEXT TIME, IT WON'T BE A
DREAM OR A NIGHTMARE.</i>

23:37.708 --> 23:40.450
NEXT TIME,
lT'LL BE FOR REAL.

23:40.544 --> 23:43.081
SO DON'T GO AWAY.

23:43.172 --> 23:45.504
WE'LL BE UP THERE
IN A LITTLE WHILE.

23:47.134 --> 23:49.000

VASTNESS OF SPACE</i>

23:51.764 --> 23:53.846
<i>IN THE VOID
THAT IS SKY--</i>

23:53.933 --> 23:58.803
<i>UP THERE IS AN ENEMY
KNOWN AS ISOLATION.</i>

23:58.896 --> 24:02.139
<i>IT SITS THERE IN
THE STARS, WAITING--</i>

24:02.232 --> 24:04.690
<i>WAITING WITH THE
PATIENCE OF EONS.</i>
