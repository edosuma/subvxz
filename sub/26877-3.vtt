WEBVTT

00:19.227 --> 00:21.104
[in Spanish]
Do you get a lot of visitors?

00:21.938 --> 00:24.774
Because this is
the perfect place for entertaining.

00:25.066 --> 00:28.236
There's a wood-burning fire pit
in the courtyard, an outdoor bar,

00:28.319 --> 00:32.115
a second jacuzzi,
and a huge pool with a diving board.

00:34.451 --> 00:37.412
-Could we see what's over there?
-Yes, of course. Have a look.

00:41.750 --> 00:47.088
You won't find another property
with these amenities, acreage, or privacy,

00:47.172 --> 00:51.718
which seems so important
to many recent buyers.

00:51.968 --> 00:53.928
No one will bother you.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.766
I think you understand us.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.435
But there is one more thing.

01:01.603 --> 01:06.024
In our line of work, we often have
to do things that are not pleasant.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.276
But they're necessary.

01:08.943 --> 01:11.780
And we must be able to do them
without interference...

01:12.697 --> 01:14.157
or drawing too much attention.

01:15.950 --> 01:16.951
You understand me?

01:17.327 --> 01:18.411
[engine revs]

01:18.495 --> 01:19.579
[man screams]

01:20.163 --> 01:21.831
[man laughs]

01:24.959 --> 01:26.002
Stand over here.

01:28.338 --> 01:29.464
[grunts]

01:30.507 --> 01:31.508
[man laughing]

01:34.844 --> 01:35.678
[grunts]

01:35.762 --> 01:36.846
[gasps]

01:37.847 --> 01:40.058
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

01:41.810 --> 01:42.852
[Rafa laughing]

01:42.936 --> 01:43.895
[gasps]

01:50.693 --> 01:52.237
[Rafa]
Way to go, Chapo!

01:52.695 --> 01:53.738
I'll take it.

01:54.030 --> 01:55.198
Do you accept cash?

01:56.407 --> 01:57.283
Uh...

01:57.367 --> 01:59.786
[Rodrigo Amarante's "Tuyo" playing]

03:28.917 --> 03:30.585
[narrator in English]
So here's a few signs

03:30.668 --> 03:33.713
your town has become the center
of a major criminal operation.

03:33.796 --> 03:36.549
Suddenly, money's being spent all over.

03:36.633 --> 03:40.595
Cars, planes, real estate.
Everyone's buying.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.932
Want to avoid those long lines
at the bank?

03:44.682 --> 03:46.017
Buy the fucking place.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.311
Like any innovator,

03:48.394 --> 03:52.190
Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo
saw things others didn't.

03:52.690 --> 03:56.361
And once his dream was realized,
it seemed so obvious,

03:56.444 --> 03:59.280
you couldn't believe
no one had thought of it before.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.407
But they hadn't.

04:01.491 --> 04:04.410
He just understood the game better
than anybody else.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.957
Which made his organization better.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.085
Ah!

04:13.336 --> 04:14.337
Ah!

04:14.420 --> 04:15.421
[laughs]

04:15.505 --> 04:16.923
It made them fucking winners.

04:26.766 --> 04:29.435
By uniting the plazas
into a single organization,

04:29.811 --> 04:32.772
Félix created Mexico's first narco union.

04:37.819 --> 04:39.487
[siren blares]

04:43.074 --> 04:45.159
[bleating]

04:52.250 --> 04:53.418
-[in Spanish] It's 200?
-Yes.

04:55.545 --> 04:58.464
[narrator] By partnering
with the traffickers' natural enemy,

04:58.548 --> 05:01.301
he made his system virtually unstoppable.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.137
-[in Spanish] You're good to go.
-[driver] Thank you.

05:06.431 --> 05:08.182
[horns honking]

05:08.266 --> 05:09.767
[cameras clicking]

05:09.851 --> 05:12.478
[narrator in English] The cops
even gave themselves fucking medals

05:12.562 --> 05:14.063
for taking out the competition.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.815
[cheering and applause]

05:22.739 --> 05:24.991
And the cash was rolling in.

05:31.080 --> 05:34.375
So much money that Félix
actually opened accounts in the States

05:34.459 --> 05:37.462
to manage cash flow
and protect his profits.

05:38.838 --> 05:41.007
We're talking over $30 million a week

05:41.090 --> 05:43.885
in the hands
of a bunch of Sinaloan cowboys.

05:43.968 --> 05:44.927
[in Spanish] Look, Rafa.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.180
You gotta watch this.

05:47.930 --> 05:48.848
Al Pacino.

05:48.931 --> 05:49.807
Scarface.

05:49.891 --> 05:50.975
No, bro.

05:51.726 --> 05:54.062
I'll tell you what we need to do:

05:54.312 --> 05:58.733
build a ramp and see if we can
get this motherfucker over the pool.

05:58.816 --> 05:59.650
Let's go!

05:59.734 --> 06:01.569
[men chattering]

06:01.652 --> 06:04.989
[narrator in English] What were good guys
doing while all of this was going down?

06:05.698 --> 06:08.117
Waiting
for the wheels of bureaucracy to turn.

06:08.868 --> 06:12.163
Specifically, a request
for Mexican surveillance flights

06:12.246 --> 06:13.873
over the northern desert.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.292
But after months of waiting,

06:16.376 --> 06:20.797
proof that something big was happening
outside of Jalisco had finally arrived.

06:22.965 --> 06:25.885
Or at least, that was the fucking plan.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.476
[in English] The fuck is this?

06:45.738 --> 06:47.949
[sighs]

06:52.703 --> 06:54.539
-That's it.
-[Kiki] That's it?

06:54.997 --> 06:56.749
We waited three months for this?

06:57.375 --> 07:00.420
This is bullshit.
You guys know that, right?

07:00.503 --> 07:02.880
Maybe those trucks weren't heading
to a marijuana grow.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.799
[Sears] You know nothing
grows in the desert?

07:04.882 --> 07:06.259
Well, it does if you irrigate it.

07:06.342 --> 07:07.885
What'd you think all the pipes were for?

07:07.969 --> 07:10.096
We hear anything about this
from any of our CIs?

07:10.179 --> 07:11.097
-No.
-Nada.

07:11.180 --> 07:14.809
All right, so the problem is we have
a U.S.-funded aerial eradication program

07:14.892 --> 07:17.311
that says nothing's there. For miles.

07:17.395 --> 07:19.772
If they didn't find anything,
they didn't want to.

07:19.856 --> 07:22.817
The eradication program
is either broken or bought and paid for

07:22.900 --> 07:25.778
-by whoever's running this fucking thing.
-[Sears] No one is running this.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.447
It's the wild fucking west.

07:27.530 --> 07:29.490
You read the same cables that I do.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.409
When Pedro Avilés
and the Naranjo brothers died,

07:31.492 --> 07:34.787
what happened to the price of weed?
It stabilized from L.A. to Houston.

07:34.871 --> 07:37.874
Because it's coming from the same
organization, the same fucking source.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.876
[sighs]
Your mysterious super-field.

07:39.959 --> 07:44.297
Mexicans don't work like that, Kiki, okay?
Organized, structured. They just...

07:44.964 --> 07:46.215
Look, no offense.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.469
Hey. You're making some big leaps, okay?

07:49.552 --> 07:51.554
Price of weed holding steady
for a couple of months?

07:51.637 --> 07:54.765
Yeah, that could mean something,
but it also could just be a coincidence.

07:55.766 --> 07:59.437
If you want, I can try
and request another recon flight.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.314
That going to change anything?

08:02.565 --> 08:05.193
We work with the system we got.

08:05.401 --> 08:07.528
Well, the joke's on us,
because the system's busted.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.865
I mean, are you guys okay with that?

08:10.948 --> 08:14.035
Chasing some Mickey Mouse bust
while some asshole's changing the game

08:14.118 --> 08:16.537
-right under our fucking noses?
-[Knapp] Look, man, hey,

08:16.621 --> 08:20.166
if there's a new doper in town, sooner
or later, someone's gonna take him out.

08:20.249 --> 08:22.960
-That's the way it works down here.
-Nothing down here works.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.045
Enlighten us.

08:24.128 --> 08:28.716
Do you have a plan for reversing decades
of institutional corruption or is this it?

08:28.799 --> 08:32.386
Turns out all we needed to fix Mexico
was a well-timed temper tantrum.

08:32.470 --> 08:35.306
Is it that you don't give a shit,
or it's been so long

08:35.389 --> 08:37.600
you forgot what doing your job
actually looks like?

08:38.226 --> 08:40.561
-You want to run that by me outside?
-I'd love to, pal.

08:41.312 --> 08:43.689
-All right. Hey! Enough of this shit!
-Fuck you!

08:43.773 --> 08:46.776
Hey, it's five o'clock. Shouldn't you be
at the Camelot drinking beers by now?

08:46.859 --> 08:49.445
Enough! Calm down! You go for a walk.

08:50.404 --> 08:51.364
Cool off.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.827
Somebody should call D.C.
and tell them we surrendered Guadalajara.

08:57.912 --> 08:58.996
[door slams]

08:59.080 --> 09:00.540
[sighs]

09:03.376 --> 09:06.337
[in Spanish]
We have 72 rooms and 6 suites.

09:07.004 --> 09:08.923
I can't believe this is all yours.

09:09.757 --> 09:12.009
-[Félix] It's an investment, Rodolfo.
-An investment?

09:12.301 --> 09:16.222
The IBM stock I got from my father
was an investment. [chuckles]

09:16.305 --> 09:18.849
Look, we'll put two bars
for your reception over there

09:18.933 --> 09:21.310
so the guests can come out
and drink in the evening.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.520
Mm.

09:23.271 --> 09:24.897
Gabriela's going to love it.

09:26.148 --> 09:29.068
I can't thank you enough, Miguel.

09:29.151 --> 09:32.697
You don't have to thank me.
Thank me for what, man?

09:33.155 --> 09:36.325
I used to watch you run around
in your underwear, terrorizing nannies.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.913
Governor Celis. Welcome.

09:40.997 --> 09:42.498
[chattering]

09:42.582 --> 09:44.333
-How are you?
-Can't complain.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.501
Three governors.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.212
-Governor Ocaña García.
-Yes, I know who you are.

09:48.296 --> 09:50.131
-Governor Álvarez.
-Nice to meet you.

09:50.214 --> 09:52.800
-Governor Del Castillo Franco.
-Delighted.

09:52.883 --> 09:57.430
Allow me to introduce our host,
Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo.

09:57.680 --> 10:01.851
A hundred years ago, Miguel Ángel
worked as a bodyguard for my family

10:01.934 --> 10:04.145
back when he was in the state police.

10:04.812 --> 10:07.356
Your aunt's here. Go say hello.

10:08.649 --> 10:09.734
Go.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.110
Excuse me.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.654
I'll let you finish, but maybe after,

10:13.738 --> 10:16.282
I can show you the ballroom
we're using for the reception.

10:16.365 --> 10:19.201
-I'd like your approval.
-We'll join you shortly.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.579
I'll leave you to it then.
Make yourselves at home.

10:21.662 --> 10:23.789
-Excuse me.
-Congratulations.

10:26.208 --> 10:29.253
[Maria] You know you weren't
this nervous before we got married.

10:29.337 --> 10:30.796
[chuckles]

10:30.880 --> 10:35.217
And our entire wedding cost less
than the damn cake you bought.

10:35.718 --> 10:38.471
We didn't have half the governors
of Mexico on our guest list.

10:39.138 --> 10:41.057
Your dad paid for our wedding.
I was quite broke.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.266
That I remember.

10:43.893 --> 10:45.061
Miguel?

10:46.103 --> 10:49.398
You think if you impress these people,
they're going to accept you?

10:49.482 --> 10:51.984
I just want the wedding to be perfect.

10:52.568 --> 10:54.320
You certainly want to impress Celis.

10:54.403 --> 10:55.821
And what if I do?

10:55.905 --> 10:58.491
Hmm? So?

10:58.574 --> 11:00.785
That man was the closest thing
I had to a father.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.578
Seriously. Am I wrong?

11:03.079 --> 11:04.538
I owe him.

11:05.164 --> 11:06.374
[intercom beeping]

11:07.166 --> 11:08.250
What's up?

11:08.417 --> 11:10.628
[woman]
Mr. Félix, you have a call.

11:12.171 --> 11:13.464
[Félix]
I have to take this call.

11:15.383 --> 11:18.052
I'll be home soon. Have to get up early.

11:18.135 --> 11:21.722
For what? To inspect the imported napkins?

11:21.806 --> 11:22.973
Oh, come on.

11:25.935 --> 11:26.811
What's up?

11:26.894 --> 11:29.188
[Don Neto]
Sorry to interrupt the ball, Cinderella.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.024
We've got a problem.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.152
[narrator in English]
There's one problem with success.

11:35.736 --> 11:37.321
Not everyone can handle it.

11:38.406 --> 11:43.202
When things go well, people start thinking
it's because they're so fucking smart.

11:46.956 --> 11:50.626
But guess what happens when you
put wolves and bears on the same team?

11:50.710 --> 11:53.379
-[in Spanish] What the fuck is this?
-Those are the leftovers.

11:53.462 --> 11:54.672
Leftovers?

11:54.755 --> 11:56.257
Fucking Sinaloans.

11:57.925 --> 12:00.761
-Right.
-[narrator in English] Someone gets eaten.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.557
[overlapping chatter]

12:09.603 --> 12:11.313
[vehicle approaching]

12:14.734 --> 12:16.944
-[in Spanish] The hell do you want?
-[gunshots]

12:17.027 --> 12:18.571
Victor!

12:18.654 --> 12:19.613
[gunshots]

12:20.614 --> 12:21.699
[screaming]

12:29.874 --> 12:31.959
[choking]

12:35.755 --> 12:37.089
What the fuck?

12:37.631 --> 12:38.841
The leftovers.

12:40.092 --> 12:41.969
[narrator in English]
But it doesn't end there.

12:42.052 --> 12:45.723
Because in the Mexican narcotics game,
everyone's related.

12:45.806 --> 12:48.559
[Benjamín in Spanish] The cops
just took out Victor Molina and his crew.

12:49.059 --> 12:51.896
They killed cousin Beto. He's dead, man.

12:57.985 --> 12:59.445
[in Spanish] Fucking cops.

13:00.070 --> 13:04.325
Molina family's been moving weed
since Nava's father was in diapers.

13:04.408 --> 13:07.453
Had their thumbs on the scale
for about that long, too.

13:07.661 --> 13:08.996
But still...

13:09.705 --> 13:12.374
the Arellano Félix brothers
want blood for their cousin.

13:12.458 --> 13:13.417
True.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.127
Kid was well-liked.

13:15.211 --> 13:16.504
Enough.

13:17.421 --> 13:19.298
We have to get the cops back in line.

13:19.381 --> 13:20.883
Police reform?

13:21.884 --> 13:23.010
Are you drunk?

13:23.093 --> 13:25.221
Seems like you don't give a shit, Neto.

13:26.555 --> 13:29.183
I'm talking to you! Then give me an idea.

13:29.266 --> 13:33.521
The number two guy doesn't solve problems.
He just points them out.

13:33.604 --> 13:34.897
[chuckles]

13:35.564 --> 13:36.690
What do you think of her?

13:38.317 --> 13:39.193
As an actress?

13:40.444 --> 13:42.112
No. As a date.

13:42.571 --> 13:45.241
-Pretty hot, no?
-Yes, she's hot.

13:45.324 --> 13:48.202
Miguel is throwing the party of the year.

13:48.285 --> 13:50.871
I want to make the right impression
on his fancy new friends.

13:50.955 --> 13:53.582
You're a smart guy, skinny.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.502
You'll figure it out.
Just don't take too long.

13:56.585 --> 13:59.255
Our guys are already asking questions.

13:59.338 --> 14:02.132
Any of these crazy motherfuckers
start a war with the DFS...

14:03.551 --> 14:06.804
-this thing is over and done with.
-I'll talk to Nava.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.277
[microwave beeps]

14:25.531 --> 14:28.158
-[Mika in English] Kiki, is that you?
-No.

14:30.119 --> 14:31.161
You ready?

14:31.579 --> 14:32.705
Ready for what?

14:32.788 --> 14:34.415
-The barbecue.
-What barbecue?

14:34.498 --> 14:35.958
You were there when Rita called.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.085
Who the fuck is Rita?

14:38.168 --> 14:41.171
Rita Knapp. Roger's wife.

14:41.255 --> 14:44.758
-Roger Knapp's barbecue's tonight?
-Yes. Another case cracked.

14:44.842 --> 14:46.802
-Come on, get ready.
-No.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.763
-What do you mean, no?
-I mean I'm not gonna go.

14:52.516 --> 14:53.517
[scoffs]

14:53.601 --> 14:56.103
[pop music playing]

14:56.937 --> 14:58.647
[chatter in background]

15:03.193 --> 15:05.321
[distant laughs]

15:05.988 --> 15:10.534
Oh, you all see that cable
that came in from the Mazatlán office?

15:10.618 --> 15:15.039
You want us to keep tabs on some guy
coming in from, uh... Sinaloa?

15:15.122 --> 15:16.123
What's his name?

15:18.208 --> 15:20.711
Coch... Cochiloco?

15:20.794 --> 15:22.421
Cochi-something.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.131
I don't know. We got it.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.551
I mean, I like that he said,
"Little chance."

15:28.260 --> 15:29.595
Roger loved that.

15:29.678 --> 15:31.472
[laughing]

15:31.555 --> 15:32.389
[Ana]
Of course!

15:39.563 --> 15:41.231
[tuning guitar]

15:44.151 --> 15:47.071
So, you guys like those burgers?

15:47.488 --> 15:49.156
-Of course.
-[Rita] Yeah, mine was great.

15:49.531 --> 15:51.492
-Honey, they were really good.
-I told you, baby.

15:51.575 --> 15:52.660
[laughs]

15:59.750 --> 16:01.377
Have you guys seen Kiki's ID yet?

16:03.170 --> 16:04.296
-[Rita] No. No.
-[Jaime] Mmm.

16:04.588 --> 16:05.673
Come on, show them.

16:07.800 --> 16:08.717
Babe, it's funny.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.313
[Kiki clears throat]

16:23.065 --> 16:25.567
-Is that a black eye?
-[Knapp] Let me see that, babe.

16:25.651 --> 16:28.445
[Mika] The week Kiki got accepted
into the DEA, we're at this wedding.

16:28.529 --> 16:32.574
Actually, we crashed it, but Calexico's
so small, everybody knows each other.

16:33.367 --> 16:36.203
So we have a few drinks,
everything's fine.

16:36.829 --> 16:40.708
Then this kid comes to the table to tell
his mom he can't go to the bathroom

16:40.791 --> 16:42.501
because there was
a guy in there smoking pot.

16:42.584 --> 16:44.670
[Rita]
Uh-oh. Busted.

16:44.753 --> 16:47.715
[Mika] Right. So brand-new federal agent
here is like, "I got this."

16:47.798 --> 16:49.508
-Heads off to the bathroom.
-[laughter]

16:49.591 --> 16:53.303
-So what happened?
-Well, it wasn't one guy, it was four.

16:53.387 --> 16:55.264
-[Knapp] Oh, I like those odds.
-[laughs]

16:55.347 --> 16:57.182
[Mika] So he says to them,

16:57.266 --> 17:01.020
"We can do this the easy way
or we can do it the hard way."

17:01.979 --> 17:04.481
Turns out the easy way
was to beat the shit out of me.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.400
All this for a joint, right?

17:07.192 --> 17:11.655
[chuckles] So I ask him,
"Was it worth it? Are you happy now?"

17:12.072 --> 17:15.784
And I said, "I had them on possession,
but now I have them on assault,

17:15.868 --> 17:17.911
so damn right it was worth it."

17:17.995 --> 17:19.413
[Sears]
Hell, yeah.

17:19.496 --> 17:21.707
[Knapp] You know what?
That story'll make me write a song.

17:22.082 --> 17:23.542
Called "Damn Right It Was Worth It."

17:23.625 --> 17:25.169
[laughter]

17:28.338 --> 17:30.049
[Kiki] Why did you tell them that story?

17:30.132 --> 17:32.634
Because it's funny. It's who you are.

17:32.718 --> 17:35.888
-Yeah, I don't need them to like me.
-Yeah, but I do.

17:36.805 --> 17:38.474
I'm down here alone, Kiki.

17:38.557 --> 17:41.643
I need to talk to other adults sometimes
to actually make friends.

17:41.727 --> 17:45.064
And it helps if the other Americans
don't all think my husband's an asshole.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.440
I'm not an asshole.

17:46.523 --> 17:47.858
Not all the time.

17:52.696 --> 17:54.073
I don't care what they think.

18:00.996 --> 18:02.164
[siren blares]

18:29.608 --> 18:31.110
[in Spanish]
Let's go. Get out.

18:33.320 --> 18:34.446
[turns off engine]

18:37.866 --> 18:39.535
[chatter over radio]

18:58.262 --> 19:00.848
[Nava]
Come in, man.

19:06.019 --> 19:07.312
Have something for you.

19:08.313 --> 19:09.815
You look good.

19:10.858 --> 19:16.738
Miguel Ángel. Agent number 1178.

19:17.239 --> 19:19.908
This is the key that opens all the doors.

19:21.243 --> 19:24.746
-I hear you want to talk.
-[Félix] Yeah.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.208
This business with Victor Molina--

19:28.292 --> 19:31.587
He crossed the line.
He was stealing from us.

19:35.090 --> 19:37.259
You seem to have forgotten one thing.

19:37.926 --> 19:41.722
Almost all of us are family
in this organization.

19:42.514 --> 19:46.977
The guy you killed
is the cousin of another guy.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.980
Another guy who is needed
for this system to work well.

19:50.814 --> 19:53.066
So both you and I can get paid.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.318
All right.

19:54.651 --> 19:56.361
I'll take that under advisement.

20:00.115 --> 20:01.408
Although... [chuckles]

20:02.367 --> 20:07.706
...you didn't mind my methods
when I found you in Avilés' car

20:07.789 --> 20:11.293
trying not to piss yourself. [laughs]

20:12.085 --> 20:13.462
[sighs]

20:13.545 --> 20:15.631
Don't let these badges fool you.

20:17.257 --> 20:19.051
You and I are not the same.

20:19.635 --> 20:22.262
You do your fucking job, and I'll do mine.

20:25.307 --> 20:26.558
We're done here.

20:31.271 --> 20:32.856
Ah. Almost forgot.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.693
Expect a call in the next few days.

20:36.860 --> 20:39.655
-A favor for someone important.
-A favor?

20:39.988 --> 20:41.031
[Nava]
Just an errand.

20:41.657 --> 20:45.285
Something needs to get
from point A to point B.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.412
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

20:47.996 --> 20:50.499
Best not to ask too many questions.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.918
I'll get you the details.

20:53.710 --> 20:55.504
[car engine starts]

21:07.849 --> 21:09.184
[grunts]

21:17.859 --> 21:20.279
[pop song playing]

21:26.868 --> 21:30.163
[Chapo] Come on, fuckers. You look
too fucking sad. Drink up, fucker.

21:30.247 --> 21:31.581
Come on, Rafa.

21:50.767 --> 21:53.729
[chattering]

22:00.527 --> 22:01.862
[laughing]

22:12.372 --> 22:13.290
Ladies.

22:13.790 --> 22:17.753
Another round. And could you clear
some of these empty glasses?

22:19.087 --> 22:20.172
Dance with me.

22:20.464 --> 22:24.468
Oh, that's sweet.
But I don't want you to get in trouble.

22:24.551 --> 22:26.511
It looks like you need the job.

22:26.595 --> 22:28.472
-I'm not a waiter.
-What?

22:28.555 --> 22:29.806
I'm not a fucking waiter.

22:29.890 --> 22:32.517
[laughing]

22:34.019 --> 22:36.271
I saw you on campus, right?

22:37.022 --> 22:39.232
I think he kidnapped my professor.

22:39.316 --> 22:41.777
I returned him in one piece, didn't I?

22:42.152 --> 22:43.987
And the fucker was loaded with money.

22:44.529 --> 22:45.364
How about it?

22:46.114 --> 22:47.741
I have a boyfriend.

22:48.909 --> 22:52.412
You're lying. You don't have a boyfriend.
Dance with me.

22:53.038 --> 22:55.290
Give me one reason why not,
and I'll leave you alone.

22:55.374 --> 22:58.085
Fine. I'll give you three.

22:59.711 --> 23:00.962
Your shirt.

23:01.922 --> 23:04.216
Your pants. [laughs]

23:04.299 --> 23:06.510
And your boots. [laughs]

23:06.593 --> 23:09.012
[girls laughing]

23:12.724 --> 23:15.519
But we both know you like
what's underneath.

23:20.941 --> 23:23.402
[laughing]

23:29.074 --> 23:33.537
-What happened, buddy?
-She's a spoiled brat.

23:33.620 --> 23:34.955
Let's drink, then.

24:01.690 --> 24:05.485
[in Spanish] Rodolfo didn't want me
to say anything this morning.

24:05.861 --> 24:09.948
Something about how he's been hearing me
give speeches.

24:12.868 --> 24:15.704
Then I spoke
with his beautiful bride-to-be,

24:16.329 --> 24:19.791
and she thought it was a wonderful idea.

24:20.333 --> 24:24.921
Welcome to marriage, son.

24:25.005 --> 24:26.423
[chuckling]

24:26.506 --> 24:29.384
[in Spanish] And you're bringing in
that much money every month?

24:29.468 --> 24:31.428
Every week.

24:34.014 --> 24:37.058
This "important person"
who wants a favor from you...

24:37.893 --> 24:39.060
Nava name him?

24:39.978 --> 24:41.354
No.

24:41.438 --> 24:42.772
You know who he's talking about?

24:44.608 --> 24:46.776
Not a man you want knowing your name.

24:49.404 --> 24:52.324
My organization needs Nava,
what he delivers.

24:52.407 --> 24:55.577
But he needs to understand
that we are in this together.

24:56.036 --> 24:58.914
And that he needs to be discreet.
He goes overboard.

24:59.581 --> 25:02.667
Don't know how much longer
I can keep all of them happy.

25:05.253 --> 25:08.340
Based on the numbers you describe,
you're making real money, Miguel.

25:08.507 --> 25:11.009
The cut you deliver doesn't stop with him.

25:11.092 --> 25:13.470
Nava's got lots of mouths to feed,

25:14.179 --> 25:17.015
which means you have leverage.

25:17.682 --> 25:20.685
Uh... Sounds good.

25:53.843 --> 25:54.844
I'll see you later.

25:58.306 --> 26:00.642
[in Spanish]
Here comes a thirsty man.

26:00.725 --> 26:03.395
[in English] If the cheapest gringo I know
is gonna buy me a drink,

26:03.478 --> 26:05.814
that shit is gonna cost me something,
right?

26:05.897 --> 26:07.524
[Jaime chuckles]

26:11.444 --> 26:14.447
[Jaime] What happened to all those
big-ass Cessnas we had lining that runway?

26:14.531 --> 26:17.325
U.S.-funded Cessnas. Where'd they go?

26:17.409 --> 26:20.412
Less than a third of the program's planes
are operational.

26:20.495 --> 26:23.373
The rest have been junked,
sold the spare parts. Pieces of shit.

26:23.456 --> 26:25.500
Same old, same old. [laughs]

26:25.584 --> 26:28.336
[Jaime]
But you guys still do fly, right?

26:28.420 --> 26:30.922
[mariachi music playing]

26:31.673 --> 26:33.633
This is just me asking, Fredo.

26:33.717 --> 26:35.427
Yeah, we fly sometimes.

26:35.510 --> 26:38.221
We also take pictures.
But only when they tell us to.

26:39.389 --> 26:40.473
You, um...

26:43.143 --> 26:44.185
You seen these?

26:50.900 --> 26:52.027
Yes, I've seen them.

26:52.819 --> 26:53.653
I took them.

26:54.904 --> 26:56.239
See this number right here?

26:56.531 --> 26:58.366
The Z? It's Zavala.

26:58.450 --> 26:59.451
That's my ID.

26:59.534 --> 27:01.036
[chuckles]

27:01.119 --> 27:02.537
But that was over a year ago.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.292
A year ago?

27:08.084 --> 27:09.210
Yeah, at least.

27:11.129 --> 27:12.422
That's what you're looking for?

27:14.591 --> 27:15.675
Yeah.

27:19.721 --> 27:20.722
Yeah.

27:21.890 --> 27:23.016
You want another beer?

27:24.184 --> 27:26.728
Sure, why not. You're buying.

27:27.562 --> 27:30.482
-[in Spanish] Señor! Two more!
-Three!

28:55.358 --> 28:57.152
[car engine starts]

31:04.946 --> 31:08.074
[chatter in Spanish]

31:27.427 --> 31:31.097
[Chilo Escobedo's "Dame Amor" playing]

31:50.199 --> 31:51.326
[in Spanish]
I'll have a beer.

32:08.051 --> 32:10.678
[mariachi music playing]

32:23.149 --> 32:24.150
Take one.

32:26.319 --> 32:28.071
Or else I'll finish the whole pack.

32:52.512 --> 32:55.223
[man on TV in English] How do I know
you're not a chivato, too, Tony?

32:55.890 --> 32:57.183
Hey, Sosa.

32:59.519 --> 33:00.353
[in Spanish] Waiter?

33:00.436 --> 33:02.146
[in English]
Let's get this straight, now.

33:02.230 --> 33:03.856
[in Spanish]
Are you fucking serious?

33:04.065 --> 33:05.233
A waiter.

33:05.316 --> 33:08.152
[in English] I never fucked anybody over
who didn't have it coming.

33:08.236 --> 33:13.074
[in Spanish] I could buy
that fucking nightclub. Stupid brat.

33:13.574 --> 33:17.620
[in English] ...and my word and I don't
break them for no one. You understand?

33:19.580 --> 33:23.668
That piece of shit up there,
I never liked him, I never trusted him.

33:23.751 --> 33:27.630
For all I know, he had me set up
and had my friend Angel Fernandez killed.

33:28.339 --> 33:30.758
But that's history. I'm here, he's not.

33:30.842 --> 33:35.805
You want to go on with me, say it.
You don't, then you make a move.

33:36.764 --> 33:37.932
[chuckles]

33:40.476 --> 33:43.855
[Kiki in Spanish]
And they put me on a bus, shipped me home.

33:43.938 --> 33:45.273
[exhales]

33:46.357 --> 33:49.527
Didn't even get to say goodbye to my wife.

33:50.486 --> 33:51.696
And she's pregnant.

33:51.779 --> 33:53.614
[ranchera music playing]

33:57.618 --> 33:58.828
Where did you say you are from?

33:59.370 --> 34:00.455
Michoacán.

34:01.706 --> 34:03.207
Doesn't sound like it.

34:03.291 --> 34:05.168
[in accented English]
Speak English too long.

34:06.294 --> 34:07.170
[Kiki laughs]

34:08.337 --> 34:10.965
[in Spanish]
Hey, any work around here?

34:11.591 --> 34:12.925
I'm a hard worker.

34:14.302 --> 34:17.513
Just need enough money to get north again.

34:20.600 --> 34:21.642
No.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.771
I don't know about any work.

34:27.732 --> 34:28.733
Go ahead.

34:29.609 --> 34:31.277
-You sure?
-Yes.

34:47.001 --> 34:49.170
[phone rings]

34:52.298 --> 34:54.092
-[in English] Hello?
-Oh, hey, babe.

34:54.467 --> 34:55.343
Hey.

34:55.718 --> 34:58.805
Hey, so I won't be able
to make it home tonight.

34:58.888 --> 34:59.722
Are you okay?

34:59.806 --> 35:01.682
No, I'm fine. I'm just on a job.

35:02.934 --> 35:05.645
-Okay. Be careful.
-I will be.

35:06.229 --> 35:08.189
-I love you.
-Love you too.

35:08.272 --> 35:09.315
Okay, bye.

35:22.495 --> 35:24.163
[vehicle approaching]

35:24.789 --> 35:25.832
[tires skid]

35:31.295 --> 35:32.672
[engine stops]

35:34.090 --> 35:35.424
[door opens]

35:44.475 --> 35:45.977
[indistinct chatter]

35:46.686 --> 35:48.437
[rooster cocking]

36:14.547 --> 36:16.632
[man in Spanish]
Heads up. The buses are coming.

36:41.240 --> 36:43.910
All right, everyone.
Start forming a line over here.

36:44.202 --> 36:45.161
Quickly.

36:48.164 --> 36:49.332
Move it.

36:57.924 --> 36:59.508
Speed it up.

37:10.686 --> 37:13.356
Hold up. I don't know you.

37:14.065 --> 37:15.399
[man]
I know him.

37:17.276 --> 37:19.028
He's my nephew from Michoacán.

37:20.613 --> 37:22.156
Had trouble up north, but...

37:22.990 --> 37:24.283
he's a hard worker.

37:27.411 --> 37:28.579
From Michoacán.

37:35.044 --> 37:36.921
Okay, get on the bus.

37:38.881 --> 37:40.466
Go!

37:50.893 --> 37:51.894
[whispers] Thanks.

37:52.353 --> 37:54.063
You owe me half your pay.

37:55.356 --> 37:57.316
Every day you work.

38:00.486 --> 38:01.821
Put the bag on.

38:02.405 --> 38:04.323
Don't take it off until they tell you to.

38:07.159 --> 38:08.411
[man]
All right, fuckers.

38:08.828 --> 38:10.204
Time to get to work.

38:26.053 --> 38:27.179
[man]
Take them off!

38:27.596 --> 38:29.432
Take off your hoods.

38:31.851 --> 38:34.061
Let's go. Get off the bus.

38:39.692 --> 38:41.027
Hurry up.

39:03.007 --> 39:04.133
[man] Come on!

39:05.051 --> 39:06.177
Time to work!

39:07.762 --> 39:10.639
They'll give you your tools.
You know what to do.

39:10.723 --> 39:12.433
Hurry up, we don't have much time.

39:37.416 --> 39:40.002
Our crew works one of the northern fields.

39:41.295 --> 39:42.963
Ever pick weed before?

39:45.257 --> 39:46.926
I'll show you what to do. Follow me.

40:09.532 --> 40:12.868
[Sears in English] The Mazatlán office
must have a real hard-on for this asshole.

40:14.036 --> 40:16.122
[Knapp] Cochiloco.

40:16.914 --> 40:17.748
"Crazy Pig."

40:17.832 --> 40:20.042
Damn, that's a good fucking nickname.

40:20.501 --> 40:23.379
[Sears]
Disco, whorehouse, barbershop.

40:24.171 --> 40:26.048
Guy's hitting the dirt-bag trifecta.

40:26.715 --> 40:28.217
You think he likes it?

40:28.884 --> 40:31.554
I mean, when they gave it to him,
you think he was like,

40:31.971 --> 40:34.723
"Cool. Cochiloco. That's me."

40:39.270 --> 40:40.438
[phone rings]

40:42.731 --> 40:43.566
[in English] Hello.

40:43.649 --> 40:47.319
-Jaime. Ed Heath.
-Thanks for getting back to me, Ed.

40:47.403 --> 40:52.575
Well, uh, a couple of months ago,
we, uh... we asked the eradication guys

40:52.658 --> 40:55.703
to do a fly-over in the desert
outside of Guadalajara.

40:55.786 --> 40:58.789
And we finally got the pictures back.

40:59.165 --> 40:59.999
Uh-huh.

41:01.709 --> 41:03.043
They're at least a year old.

41:04.378 --> 41:07.798
And no flights have been ordered
over that area since that time.

41:08.757 --> 41:12.344
-So what are you saying?
-The eradication program's bullshit.

41:12.428 --> 41:16.140
I mean, it's a fraud,
or at least it's been compromised.

41:19.935 --> 41:21.645
The thing is, Jaime... [ sighs]

41:21.729 --> 41:24.315
...that's a bit of a complicated knot
you're tugging on there.

41:25.774 --> 41:26.901
I don't understand.

41:26.984 --> 41:32.823
Well, as far as the Mexican government
is concerned, the program works fine.

41:32.907 --> 41:36.577
-I think that's the problem--
-And the State Department agrees.

41:37.161 --> 41:38.704
It's considered a model program.

41:40.122 --> 41:43.709
They see it as "strong evidence
of the successful partnership

41:43.792 --> 41:45.753
between our two governments."

41:46.337 --> 41:47.755
That's a direct quote from State.

41:49.006 --> 41:50.090
I see.

41:52.551 --> 41:56.055
Jaime, we're guests down here.

41:56.805 --> 42:01.602
And people don't like it when guests
start nosing through the cupboards.

42:01.685 --> 42:04.021
You understand
where I'm pointing at with this one?

42:04.104 --> 42:06.607
Yeah, I do. I do. That...

42:08.150 --> 42:10.069
That all tracks on this end.

42:11.737 --> 42:14.073
Good. [sighs] Good.

42:14.865 --> 42:18.285
Look, I don't like it any more than you,

42:18.369 --> 42:21.539
but this is the deal.

42:21.622 --> 42:23.958
Yes, sir.
I appreciate you taking the time.

42:44.478 --> 42:46.146
[in Spanish]
Your hands will get used to it.

42:52.611 --> 42:53.696
[sighs]

42:54.238 --> 42:55.864
How big is this place?

42:59.243 --> 43:00.619
I've never seen the end of it.

43:32.943 --> 43:34.111
You should eat.

43:34.820 --> 43:37.781
It's all we get for the rest of the day.

43:43.621 --> 43:45.331
-[El Azul] Cuco.
-[Cuco] What's up, boss?

43:50.419 --> 43:51.545
[El Azul]
Where is Rafa?

43:52.421 --> 43:53.922
[Cuco]
He had an emergency in the city.

43:55.090 --> 43:57.676
[El Azul] We came out here
and that motherfucker's in the city?

43:59.219 --> 44:02.681
-[Tomás] Just ask for the inventory.
-[El Azul] Show me the inventory.

44:02.765 --> 44:05.392
Pepe!
Bring the inventory list and two beers.

44:06.268 --> 44:09.063
Make sure they're cold. It's fucking hot.

44:15.986 --> 44:17.571
[bell rings]

44:17.655 --> 44:20.282
[man]
Back to work, fuckers.

44:20.366 --> 44:22.576
[chattering]

44:25.412 --> 44:27.247
[dialing rotary phone]

44:33.629 --> 44:35.214
[in Spanish] It's me.

44:36.757 --> 44:40.052
Listen-- Listen to me!

44:41.178 --> 44:42.846
You want payback, right?

44:44.348 --> 44:47.810
Come to my hotel tonight.

44:50.688 --> 44:53.649
Tell them you're my personal guest.
And dress nice.

44:54.441 --> 44:55.609
I'm serious.

44:55.693 --> 44:56.819
Okay, then.

45:14.378 --> 45:15.838
[Félix]
I have a job for you.

45:17.256 --> 45:19.299
Get some men.

45:38.277 --> 45:40.612
[bell rings]

45:41.196 --> 45:42.865
[man in Spanish]
Time to go. Move it.

45:44.283 --> 45:45.284
That's it.

45:49.580 --> 45:51.790
Michoacán. Back to the bus.

46:01.341 --> 46:03.302
Look at these poor fuckers.

46:03.969 --> 46:06.388
Working under the sun all fucking day.

46:24.573 --> 46:25.949
Hold on.

46:26.366 --> 46:27.868
Wait for me right here.

46:39.671 --> 46:40.964
[Tomás]
Where are you going, boss?

46:47.846 --> 46:48.680
[man] Let's go.

46:52.267 --> 46:53.519
Let's go.

47:03.237 --> 47:04.446
[man] Hoods on.

47:23.173 --> 47:24.466
[Tomás] Boss!

47:25.384 --> 47:27.636
Rafa is on the phone!

47:28.262 --> 47:29.221
Be right there.

47:35.227 --> 47:37.312
[bus engine starts]

47:40.566 --> 47:41.483
[sighs]

47:41.567 --> 47:43.318
[in English]
What is this asshole up to now?

47:47.781 --> 47:48.949
What the fuck?

47:51.368 --> 47:52.619
[Sears] Jesus.

48:11.346 --> 48:13.056
[in Spanish]
You look very handsome, my love.

48:13.724 --> 48:15.309
You look good, too.

48:16.935 --> 48:18.103
Are you ready?

48:23.734 --> 48:25.152
[man]
Ladies and gentlemen,

48:25.235 --> 48:31.199
Mr. and Mrs. Rodolfo Celis invite you
to join them on the dance floor!

48:31.700 --> 48:33.201
[band music playing]

48:42.502 --> 48:44.755
[chattering]

49:03.857 --> 49:05.901
[Sears in English]
What the fuck is this guy doing?

49:06.693 --> 49:09.571
What kind of party
did shit-bird make the cut on?

49:12.574 --> 49:15.202
Hope you got
your dancing shoes, there, Butch.

49:16.620 --> 49:18.956
-Find a place to park.
-Yup.

49:41.353 --> 49:43.647
[chattering]

49:48.402 --> 49:49.778
Ah!

49:50.612 --> 49:51.822
[in Spanish] Sit down.

50:28.191 --> 50:29.901
[speaking indistinctly]

50:55.218 --> 50:56.970
[in Spanish]
See you tomorrow, Michoacán.

51:18.241 --> 51:20.827
[phone rings]

51:23.622 --> 51:26.541
-[in English] DEA.
-Hey, it's Kiki. Where's Kuykendall?

51:26.625 --> 51:28.627
Kiki, where've you been?
We've been looking for you.

51:28.710 --> 51:30.712
Mika's in labor. She's at the hospital.

51:32.214 --> 51:34.174
[band music playing]

51:36.426 --> 51:38.970
[laughing]

51:39.054 --> 51:41.014
[in Spanish]
My queen was thirsty.

51:41.515 --> 51:42.516
Always.

51:43.100 --> 51:45.685
-How about we have another drink?
-You want another one?

51:52.818 --> 51:53.860
Excuse me.

51:59.783 --> 52:00.867
Excuse me.

52:01.618 --> 52:02.828
What's up?

52:02.911 --> 52:04.579
We gonna have a problem?

52:15.006 --> 52:17.300
I have to go get a martini, my friend.

52:24.933 --> 52:27.435
-What's wrong with your brother?
-[Benjamín] He's pissed.

52:49.207 --> 52:51.251
Ladies and gentlemen,
thanks for being here.

52:51.334 --> 52:53.712
I would like to ask you
to go downstairs to your tables.

52:53.795 --> 52:56.131
The party is better down there.

52:57.048 --> 52:58.133
Thank you.

53:03.555 --> 53:06.725
I didn't know
they allowed assholes at the party.

53:06.808 --> 53:08.351
Hey, put that down!

53:08.435 --> 53:11.897
Hey, Ramon! Don't do something stupid.

53:12.355 --> 53:15.108
I brought you here to listen, not talk.

53:15.192 --> 53:16.902
Tie up your mutts.

53:16.985 --> 53:18.403
That goes for all of you.

53:22.324 --> 53:23.450
Let's see, Mr. Nava.

53:25.535 --> 53:29.122
You received some cash today.

53:29.206 --> 53:33.501
For the second time,
the envelope was light. Right?

53:35.670 --> 53:39.883
And in response,
you decided to make another point.

53:41.218 --> 53:42.886
Something to teach them a lesson.

53:44.512 --> 53:47.766
Show what happens to men who disobey you.

53:49.893 --> 53:51.144
Check all the rooms.

54:02.239 --> 54:03.865
Search the property.

54:04.199 --> 54:05.367
[Félix]
Thing is, Comandante...

54:07.494 --> 54:08.328
so did I.

54:11.998 --> 54:13.416
Good evening.

54:15.001 --> 54:17.462
Your weapons, gentlemen.

54:17.587 --> 54:21.549
Fucking chinolo. You set me up.

54:23.051 --> 54:25.136
The brothers want blood.

54:25.804 --> 54:27.347
And that's fair.

54:27.889 --> 54:30.600
So you'll get the man responsible
for your cousin's death.

54:30.934 --> 54:33.353
[grunting]

54:44.614 --> 54:47.659
[Nava] What makes you so sure
I'll accept these terms?

54:47.742 --> 54:50.078
[scoffs] You have to understand something.

54:50.161 --> 54:52.372
We are the ones that grow it.

54:52.872 --> 54:57.168
You make sure nobody fucks with it.
That's it.

54:59.462 --> 55:01.131
And I run the show.

55:02.257 --> 55:04.551
Without me, you got nothing.

55:05.135 --> 55:07.262
But if you want,
we can throw away everything.

55:07.637 --> 55:10.682
And then you can explain to all the men
on your payroll why their money is gone.

55:12.309 --> 55:15.979
As long as the money is coming in,
Don Miguel.

55:17.647 --> 55:19.733
But the minute it's not,

55:20.108 --> 55:23.570
I'll be the one
putting a bullet in your face.

55:29.451 --> 55:34.456
I want you to go back downstairs
and sit at that table,

55:34.539 --> 55:36.541
so that everyone sees
you having a drink together.

55:36.624 --> 55:38.001
Because this is over.

55:39.419 --> 55:41.129
It's over. Understood?

55:47.135 --> 55:48.511
One more thing.

55:48.887 --> 55:53.600
You can tell this "someone important"
I'm not in the business of doing favors.

55:56.061 --> 55:58.980
Now we are done here.

56:02.317 --> 56:05.528
What's up, Ramon?
I told you to dress nice, fucker.

56:05.612 --> 56:06.863
This is nice.

56:09.282 --> 56:10.825
Ramon.

56:12.077 --> 56:13.661
[Félix]
Never forget where you come from.

56:15.372 --> 56:18.291
We Sinaloans may scatter to the winds,

56:18.375 --> 56:25.131
but our roots
keep us planted firmly on the ground.

56:27.175 --> 56:31.012
Know that today,
you have taken part in a sacred act.

56:32.555 --> 56:35.392
"The blood of the covenant
is thicker than the water of the womb."

56:35.517 --> 56:39.854
There is no stronger bond
than that of the family you choose.

56:40.605 --> 56:45.318
And today, you decided to be together,
to be a family.

56:46.444 --> 56:47.529
You're screwed.

56:47.612 --> 56:48.905
[all chuckle]

56:48.988 --> 56:53.243
So, cheers,
and long live the bride and groom.

56:53.326 --> 56:55.954
[cheering and applause]

57:09.759 --> 57:11.719
[Celis]
One more thing, if I may.

57:11.803 --> 57:17.475
What politician can resist a microphone?

57:17.559 --> 57:19.269
[all chuckle]

57:22.063 --> 57:27.777
As father of the groom, I'd like
to take a moment to thank our host.

57:28.278 --> 57:29.988
When I first met Miguel Ángel,

57:30.280 --> 57:32.740
all he had to his name
was a pistol and a badge

57:32.824 --> 57:36.536
and someone had to loan him
the money for the gun.

57:36.619 --> 57:38.037
[Celis chuckles]

57:38.955 --> 57:42.208
As Rodolfo's friend,

57:43.001 --> 57:47.547
this man loved and protected my son

57:48.798 --> 57:50.633
like his own.

57:52.260 --> 57:54.762
For that, I have always been grateful.

57:56.598 --> 57:59.601
Now, standing here tonight
in his beautiful hotel,

58:00.852 --> 58:03.771
seeing the man he's become,

58:04.564 --> 58:06.274
and the success he's achieved...

58:07.734 --> 58:09.611
I'm also proud. Beyond measure.

58:11.988 --> 58:13.656
Let's raise a glass.

58:14.449 --> 58:19.412
To my old friend,
one of Guadalajara's rising stars,

58:19.496 --> 58:21.873
Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo.

58:23.124 --> 58:24.083
For my godfather!

58:24.167 --> 58:27.879
[cheering and applause]

58:39.599 --> 58:41.976
[in Spanish]
Kiki, she's in labor.

58:42.060 --> 58:44.771
-Where is she?
-In the operating room. This way.

58:49.025 --> 58:50.443
Hey, you can't be in here.

58:50.527 --> 58:53.112
-It's okay. He's my husband.
-[in English] Hey, baby.

58:53.196 --> 58:55.406
[nurse in Spanish] He has to clean
and wash, please.

58:55.490 --> 58:57.825
-[chuckles]
-[in English] You look beautiful.

58:58.326 --> 59:00.119
I love you, baby. I love you.

59:00.203 --> 59:02.705
[band music playing]

59:17.887 --> 59:18.930
[in Spanish] Dance?

59:21.516 --> 59:23.476
Don't look at her. I'm talking to you.

59:23.977 --> 59:26.563
Sorry, man. I just beat you to it.
Shall we?

1:00:26.998 --> 1:00:28.750
[mariachi music playing]

1:00:58.780 --> 1:01:01.658
[chattering]

1:01:07.538 --> 1:01:10.249
[singing in Spanish]

1:01:19.676 --> 1:01:21.719
Looks like your problems got resolved.

1:01:24.263 --> 1:01:26.849
Took a friend's advice.

1:01:28.810 --> 1:01:32.522
Thank you, sir. For everything.

1:01:35.692 --> 1:01:37.318
[cheering]

1:01:46.869 --> 1:01:49.414
$100,000 for the other governors.

1:01:49.497 --> 1:01:51.499
$200,000 for me.

1:01:52.583 --> 1:01:54.293
My advice isn't free.

1:01:54.794 --> 1:01:56.587
Neither is my friendship.

1:01:58.673 --> 1:02:02.385
Have the money delivered
to our rooms tonight.

1:02:04.595 --> 1:02:05.805
What did you think?

1:02:06.973 --> 1:02:10.560
Just because you bought a hotel, a few
banks, doesn't change how things work.

1:02:11.018 --> 1:02:13.563
Or who you are under that suit.

1:02:15.523 --> 1:02:18.151
Don't forget who you really are.

1:02:21.612 --> 1:02:23.364
This is how business is done...

1:02:24.824 --> 1:02:25.783
my son.

1:02:33.624 --> 1:02:34.584
[grunts]

1:02:37.003 --> 1:02:39.547
This motherfucker needs to see my face.

1:02:50.558 --> 1:02:51.809
[groans]

1:02:56.022 --> 1:02:58.399
[grunts]

1:03:06.699 --> 1:03:08.618
[groaning]

1:03:12.288 --> 1:03:15.082
[in Spanish] I called Maria
so she could take care of Kikito.

1:03:15.166 --> 1:03:16.292
And Antonio brought me.

1:03:16.959 --> 1:03:20.755
She wanted to drive herself here,
but I didn't let her.

1:03:20.838 --> 1:03:22.089
[whispers] He came early.

1:03:23.925 --> 1:03:26.177
He wasn't supposed to be born yet.

1:03:27.845 --> 1:03:29.096
[in English] I'm sorry.

1:03:29.472 --> 1:03:32.850
It's okay. You're here.

1:03:36.646 --> 1:03:37.814
[Mika chuckles]

1:03:37.897 --> 1:03:38.773
[clears throat]

1:03:38.856 --> 1:03:41.526
[in Spanish]
I'm going to call Maria. I'll be back.

1:03:41.609 --> 1:03:42.777
Thank you.

1:03:52.078 --> 1:03:53.246
[in English] Look at my boy.

1:03:53.746 --> 1:03:55.623
He came out when he wanted to.

1:03:56.290 --> 1:03:58.960
Stubborn. Like his dad.

1:04:02.421 --> 1:04:05.007
Work didn't know where you were.
You want to check in with them?

1:04:05.091 --> 1:04:06.217
Mm-mmm.

1:04:07.552 --> 1:04:09.554
Nah, I just want to sit here a while.

1:04:11.347 --> 1:04:12.849
With my baby boy.

1:04:21.107 --> 1:04:23.150
[church bells ringing]

1:04:25.653 --> 1:04:28.823
-[Kiki in English] Hey, Suzy. Is he in?
-Yeah. Congratulations, Kiki.

1:04:28.906 --> 1:04:29.866
Oh, thank you.

1:04:40.042 --> 1:04:40.877
[Kiki] Sir.

1:04:45.047 --> 1:04:48.551
I picked this myself,
200 miles north of the city.

1:04:51.596 --> 1:04:54.056
The eradication program is bullshit.

1:04:57.059 --> 1:04:57.977
Brass know that?

1:04:58.060 --> 1:05:01.230
[chuckles] Christ.
I don't know what they know.

1:05:01.314 --> 1:05:03.608
-You can see it from outer space.
-I believe you.

1:05:03.691 --> 1:05:06.652
But if you ever do something as stupid
as going up there alone again,

1:05:06.736 --> 1:05:08.821
you can pack your shit,
'cause I'm sending you home.

1:05:09.864 --> 1:05:10.823
Yes, sir.

1:05:13.034 --> 1:05:14.785
-Desert dope?
-[Kiki] Yep.

1:05:15.661 --> 1:05:16.621
I tried to tell you.

1:05:16.704 --> 1:05:21.250
Everyone's involved. The DFS.
Jalisco P.D. Everyone.

1:05:21.334 --> 1:05:23.753
[Jaime] You add whoever's running
the eradication program,

1:05:23.836 --> 1:05:25.546
we got ourselves a conspiracy.

1:05:26.088 --> 1:05:30.217
Well, that conspiracy threw itself
one hell of a party last night.

1:05:30.635 --> 1:05:32.887
I bought these off
the wedding photographer.

1:05:32.970 --> 1:05:34.221
We got ourselves...

1:05:35.389 --> 1:05:38.392
governors, senators,

1:05:38.476 --> 1:05:41.354
brand-name big shots
like the head of the DFS...

1:05:42.188 --> 1:05:45.900
and a who's who of Sinaloan dirt-bags.

1:05:45.983 --> 1:05:47.944
I've never seen so many assholes
under one roof.

1:05:48.027 --> 1:05:49.904
Someone is making them all sing in tune.

1:05:49.987 --> 1:05:51.489
Running dope like it's a corporation.

1:05:51.572 --> 1:05:54.075
All right, well,
who's our Lee Iacocca then?

1:06:01.791 --> 1:06:04.877
Who's that guy?
The skinny dude getting his ass kissed?

1:06:06.003 --> 1:06:06.879
[Knapp] Sinaloan.

1:06:06.963 --> 1:06:09.632
Owned the hotel, plus a bunch
of other shit in the town,

1:06:09.715 --> 1:06:12.385
and he was definitely
the El Padrino at this thing.

1:06:12.468 --> 1:06:13.803
[Jaime] The Godfather.

1:06:16.555 --> 1:06:19.141
-[Kiki] What's his name?
-[Knapp] Miguel Félix Gallardo.

1:06:24.647 --> 1:06:25.481
[Kiki] That's him.

1:06:26.148 --> 1:06:27.233
That's our guy.
