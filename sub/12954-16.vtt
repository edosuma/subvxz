00:07.307 --> 00:09.798
(Sydney) The first time
I learned of Prophet Five.

00:09.876 --> 00:13.437
my fiance was gunned down
in front of me.

00:13.513 --> 00:16.971
Turns out he wasn't the first.

00:17.050 --> 00:19.382
They killed anyone who got too close.

00:21.421 --> 00:24.515
They'd infiltrated the highest levels
of governments

00:24.591 --> 00:28.459
and the inner sanctums
of intelligence agencies.

00:28.528 --> 00:34.489
They appeared to control entire sectors
of technology. finance. defense.

00:34.567 --> 00:36.899
We believed they were run by
a group of 1 2

00:36.970 --> 00:39.097
whose power was everywhere
and nowhere.

00:39.172 --> 00:41.902
because no one knew who they were...

00:43.476 --> 00:45.774
until now.

00:47.781 --> 00:53.413
I've lived with secrets all my life.
and I'm done.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.074

01:19.646 --> 01:24.674
- Don't believe I've seen you here before.
- A vodka martini, please. Dry.

01:30.590 --> 01:34.185
- Got visual conformation.
- Copy that, I'm standing by.

01:43.269 --> 01:45.430
- Got it.
- Understood. Good work.

01:47.173 --> 01:52.805
Mr. Kheel, Ms. McMullen, of course.
Your party is waiting. Right this way.

01:56.716 --> 01:58.707
- This is Phoenix, do you read?
- Go ahead.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.946
Kheel and McMullen,
I remember those names.

02:01.020 --> 02:03.716
- They're in the Prophet Five archive.
- Pulling it up now.

02:04.157 --> 02:07.786
McMullen and Kheel. You're right.
They're members of Prophet Five.

02:07.861 --> 02:09.852
- They're here.
- Can you get their picture?

02:09.929 --> 02:13.922
- I think so. I'll have to improvise.
- Don't risk blowing your cover.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.264
I won't.

02:23.910 --> 02:26.174
(Jack) Outrigger. what's your status?

02:26.246 --> 02:28.737
- I'm in position.
- Copy. Any sign of your target?

02:29.382 --> 02:32.010
Standing by.

02:34.554 --> 02:36.613
Come on. Turn around.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.467
Target acquired. I'm done here.

03:08.488 --> 03:11.321
I got a nasty skin condition.

03:11.391 --> 03:13.552
You do not want to
see me without my shirt.

03:13.626 --> 03:17.528
It's not a...
It's not a pretty sight.

03:26.673 --> 03:31.542
Ooh! Time flies in the old steam room.

03:31.611 --> 03:35.911
Has it really been six minutes?
It feels like... two.

03:37.383 --> 03:39.851
I'm gonna run.
Nice talking with you.

03:40.253 --> 03:41.277
Sorry.

03:46.726 --> 03:51.686
Son of a bitch! Why do I always get
the assignments that involve hypothermia?

03:51.764 --> 03:53.629
'Cause you're late to briefings.

04:35.742 --> 04:37.869
Dammit.

04:43.616 --> 04:45.607
(horn)

04:55.962 --> 04:57.088
Visuals acquired.

05:05.338 --> 05:09.672
Oh, I am really sorry, Debbie.

05:10.343 --> 05:12.834
- (Jack) Phoenix. do you copy?
- Phoenix here.

05:12.912 --> 05:14.903
I'm signing off.
Can you handle this?

05:14.981 --> 05:17.643
- I'm on it. Good luck. Dad.
- Likewise.

05:30.797 --> 05:32.924
Would you mind?
It's for my granddaughter.

05:32.999 --> 05:36.093
- Sure.
- Try to get the Capitol in the back.

05:37.403 --> 05:39.394
(woman) Smile!

05:48.948 --> 05:52.748
Excuse me.
What do you think you're doing?

05:52.819 --> 05:57.847
Oh, hey, I'm covering for Debbie.
She said she cleared it, didn't she?

05:57.924 --> 05:59.983
- No.
- OK, well, she said she did.

06:00.059 --> 06:04.826
She had some kind of family emergency.
Her sister was sick. The gross kind.

06:09.702 --> 06:13.798
- It's good of you to fill in.
- I need the tips. It's expensive down under.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.568
(phone rings)

06:15.641 --> 06:18.542
Mate, we got a situation down here.

06:18.611 --> 06:22.206
Excuse me.
How did you say you knew Debbie?

06:35.094 --> 06:37.085
(man) Hey!

07:27.113 --> 07:30.139
Now we know who we're fighting.

07:59.078 --> 08:02.047
(Jack) Now that we know who the 1 2 are,
we've filled in details,

08:02.114 --> 08:04.241
none of which are reassuring.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.785
Between them, these people wield
enormous power.

08:06.853 --> 08:09.947
Their global reach is... well, global.

08:10.022 --> 08:12.582
We know who they are.
Why don't we just take them in?

08:12.658 --> 08:17.493
Unfortunately, it's not that simple.
We need to make the right move.

08:17.563 --> 08:20.327
We need to arrest them simultaneously.

08:20.399 --> 08:22.959
We need a program
to track their movements.

08:23.035 --> 08:27.836
Input the visuals and data we have on
the 1 2 and cross-reference everything.

08:27.907 --> 08:32.434
OK. That should just take me a lifetime.
That's really...

08:32.511 --> 08:36.448
- No problem, I'll get right on that.
- What about Sloane?

08:36.515 --> 08:40.111
We're operating under the assumption
that he's working for the 1 2.

08:40.186 --> 08:42.916
We take them down - we get to him.

08:44.357 --> 08:47.758
The 1 2 have been searching
for this for a long time.

08:47.827 --> 08:51.593
- Since before you were born.
- Don't get too attached.

08:51.664 --> 08:55.464
They're expecting it to be turned over.
I should get going.

08:55.535 --> 08:59.733
Have you ever considered
what would happen if you did that?

09:00.239 --> 09:06.144
Once Prophet Five has the amulet,
their use for you - for all of us -

09:06.212 --> 09:10.342
would be limited. Unless we find
a way of solidifying our position.

09:10.416 --> 09:13.044
Making ourselves less expendable.

09:13.119 --> 09:15.451
That's a very bold move, Arvin.

09:15.521 --> 09:18.684
Trying to cut a side deal
with one of their top assets?

09:18.758 --> 09:22.194
I'm well aware that you can
tell them what I'm proposing.

09:22.261 --> 09:24.559
It might curry you some favor.

09:24.630 --> 09:28.498
Save your life... temporarily.

09:28.568 --> 09:34.336
But you're like me. You have
good instincts for self-preservation.

09:34.407 --> 09:39.071
Perhaps the fact that you'll be
compensated for your efforts.

09:39.145 --> 09:42.273
So does he come with the package?

09:42.348 --> 09:47.115
- I assume that means you're interested?
- What do you have in mind?

09:58.230 --> 10:00.664
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

10:04.470 --> 10:06.597
Isabelle's gonna be up in two hours.

10:06.672 --> 10:08.902
I can't sleep.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.546
I can see why.
This stuff would give anyone nightmares.

10:16.148 --> 10:20.676
The man that gave me the amulet told me
that what was inside was the end of nature.

10:20.753 --> 10:24.086
And that stars would fall from the sky.

10:24.156 --> 10:26.920
No matter what I did, I couldn't stop it.

10:26.993 --> 10:31.259
Well, consider the source.

10:31.330 --> 10:34.424
A prisoner in a maximum security prison.

10:34.500 --> 10:38.061
He recognized me.
He knew who I was.

10:39.238 --> 10:41.229
Weird, yeah. Not conclusive.

10:41.307 --> 10:44.003
- What if he's right?
- He's not.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.978
How can you say that?
With everything we've seen.

10:53.152 --> 10:57.111
"This woman without pretense..."
That would be you.

10:57.189 --> 11:01.649
"... will have her effect, never seeing the
beauty of my sky behind Mount Subasio."

11:01.727 --> 11:04.821
Wordy and wrong.
All this talk about prophecy and fate -

11:04.897 --> 11:08.298
you disproved it. You climbed
Mount Subasio and saw the sky.

11:08.367 --> 11:11.336
- It's not just that.
- Sloane?

11:14.607 --> 11:17.337
I keep thinking about
all the people he's killed.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.708
Including his own daughter.

11:21.781 --> 11:24.716
I know what it's like
to grow up without a mom.

11:24.784 --> 11:27.548
I don't want that for lsabelle,
she needs me.

11:28.554 --> 11:32.456
Which is why we won't let that happen.

11:32.525 --> 11:36.017
- You promise?
- I promise.

11:39.131 --> 11:40.962
Hey.

11:43.335 --> 11:46.099
Mm. Your hair smells like fruit.

11:46.172 --> 11:51.508
Mm. Mitchell threw apple sauce
at my head this afternoon.

11:51.577 --> 11:57.573
- I didn't get a chance to wash it out.
- Don't worry. I find it very attractive.

11:59.952 --> 12:05.982
- You do realize I'm half asleep, right?
- Perhaps I can inspire you to wake up.

12:06.058 --> 12:08.754
(child) Daddy!

12:08.828 --> 12:12.730
Or perhaps you could go
check on Mitchell.

12:12.798 --> 12:15.096
Right.

12:16.235 --> 12:18.635
I'll be back.

12:20.039 --> 12:22.166
- Turn off the light.
- Got it.

12:23.008 --> 12:24.475
(knocking)

12:25.544 --> 12:30.709
- Tom.
- I'm sorry, I didn't realize how late it was.

12:30.783 --> 12:35.413
No, that's OK. I was up, working.
What's going on?

12:35.488 --> 12:40.187
Just in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd see if you were awake.

12:41.193 --> 12:44.754
Which is ridiculous,
because it's not true.

12:46.265 --> 12:50.099
- I wanted to talk to you.
- Come on in. Please.

12:53.472 --> 12:56.964
- Do you want something to drink?
- What do you got?

12:57.643 --> 12:59.838
Coffee.

12:59.912 --> 13:05.475
You're not gonna give me some lecture
about drinking on a school night, are you?

13:05.551 --> 13:07.917
Not yet.

13:11.056 --> 13:13.718
You're thinking about her, aren't you?

13:16.595 --> 13:20.258
I wish I had done things differently.

13:20.332 --> 13:23.392
Could have saved her.

13:23.469 --> 13:26.029
But I didn't.

13:26.105 --> 13:28.801
What happened to your wife -
it was a crime.

13:28.874 --> 13:33.004
Korman pulled the trigger, not you.

13:33.078 --> 13:35.478
Then why do I feel like I'm to blame?

13:37.383 --> 13:39.544
Because you're a good man.

13:51.063 --> 13:54.965
- Um... Rachel, I'm sorry.
- No, it's OK.

13:55.034 --> 13:58.731
- That's not why I came here.
- No, I know. I know.

13:58.804 --> 14:02.035
- It's not a big deal at all, I mean...
- No, I should go.

14:02.107 --> 14:04.007
No.

14:04.076 --> 14:07.944
Stay, and we'll talk. Please.

14:09.448 --> 14:12.975
- I'm gonna get us that coffee.
- OK.

14:43.349 --> 14:45.874
What's taking you guys so long?

15:04.570 --> 15:06.936
Marshall?

15:08.007 --> 15:10.168
About what hap...

15:11.944 --> 15:14.071
(knocking)

15:18.250 --> 15:22.118
- Where did you go?
- It's been a while, hasn't it?

15:22.187 --> 15:23.449
(screams)

15:35.067 --> 15:37.058
Where's Mitchell?
Where's my wife?

15:37.136 --> 15:39.798
Your family's fine.
They're safe at home.

15:39.872 --> 15:43.535
Although, I imagine
they're sick with worry.

15:45.144 --> 15:49.513
- What do you want from me?
- Rambaldi described a cavern.

15:49.581 --> 15:54.678
He gave a very precise description
of the stone formation inside.

15:54.753 --> 15:57.517
- I want you to locate it for me.
- What?

15:57.589 --> 16:01.821
You're familiar with the US government's
ground-penetrating satellite network.

16:01.894 --> 16:07.958
- I need you to access the system.
- You're tasking me?

16:08.033 --> 16:11.002
- What? You think you're still my boss?
- Marshall...

16:11.070 --> 16:15.063
What you're doing is bad. I know that.
It's, like, end-of-the-world bad.

16:15.140 --> 16:18.667
This is not a request.

16:18.744 --> 16:20.837
I will not help you.

16:23.349 --> 16:27.012
Let me know when you persuade him.

16:32.191 --> 16:34.250
What are you doing? What is that?

16:34.326 --> 16:36.317
What is that?

16:36.395 --> 16:40.798
Hey, hey. Take it easy.
OK, let's talk about this. No! Ow!

16:40.866 --> 16:42.333
Please!

16:43.402 --> 16:46.929
Thank you for coming.
I'm so glad you're here.

16:48.040 --> 16:52.841
- How are you holding up?
- I sent Mitchell to my mother's.

16:54.013 --> 16:57.574
I mean, he wouldn't just leave.
You know him, right? He wouldn't do that.

16:57.649 --> 17:00.174
- No, he wouldn't.
- It makes no sense.

17:00.252 --> 17:04.586
He's a game designer -
why would somebody abduct him?

17:05.790 --> 17:09.089
- There's something you need to know.
- (phone rings)

17:09.161 --> 17:11.628
Excuse me.

17:11.696 --> 17:15.565
Marshall doesn't work for
a video game designer.

17:16.001 --> 17:18.595
- Bristow.
- I'm at Rachel's place.

17:18.670 --> 17:22.162
I got worried when she didn't check in.
Door was open.

17:22.241 --> 17:26.371
Wallet, keys, phone are still here.
It can't be a coincidence.

17:26.444 --> 17:29.744
Get back to APO. Alert the team.
We'll meet you there.

17:29.815 --> 17:31.806
I'm on my way.

17:41.994 --> 17:46.988
But I worked for the ClA, the NSA -
why would he need to lie?

17:47.066 --> 17:50.661
You have to understand, Carrie,
he was ordered not to tell you.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.727
We all were.

17:52.805 --> 17:56.206
- He was trying to protect you.
- We need to get back.

17:56.275 --> 17:59.403
- There's another situation.
- I wanna go with you.

17:59.478 --> 18:03.175
- That's not possible.
- I can't watch from the sidelines.

18:03.248 --> 18:07.184
Without Marshall your technical support
is compromised. I can help.

18:07.252 --> 18:11.814
- Please.
- OK. Grab your coat.

18:14.893 --> 18:19.694
Thought a lot about you
since the last time we saw each other.

18:22.701 --> 18:25.033
Was hoping we'd meet again.

18:29.141 --> 18:34.135
Of course, in my mind it was...
under much different circumstances.

18:39.418 --> 18:41.477
Rachel, don't make me do this.

18:42.621 --> 18:47.923
Is now when you tell me this will hurt you
a lot more than it hurts me?

18:48.727 --> 18:51.252
I wish that were true.

18:53.699 --> 18:54.893
(screams)

18:55.767 --> 18:58.793
Sloane did this.

18:58.871 --> 19:04.104
He knows where we live,
where we work, how we work.

19:04.176 --> 19:09.478
- The question remains - why?
- To disable our technical capabilities.

19:09.548 --> 19:13.416
- To distract us.
- Perhaps he needs something from them.

19:14.386 --> 19:16.877
And Marshall and Rachel -

19:16.955 --> 19:20.618
you know he won't hesitate to kill them
once he gets what he needs.

19:20.692 --> 19:22.683
I know.

19:24.830 --> 19:28.391
You were right about him.

19:29.468 --> 19:32.960
After lrina was extracted
I was taken into custody.

19:33.705 --> 19:38.768
I had to designate a guardian for Sydney.

19:38.844 --> 19:41.335
I chose Sloane.

19:43.048 --> 19:45.573
In spite of everything he's done,

19:45.651 --> 19:52.056
I believed that some part of him was still
the friend I once trusted with my daughter.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.727
Clearly, I was wrong.

20:03.936 --> 20:07.372
Oh, my God... Vaughn.

20:07.439 --> 20:10.067
I thought you were...

20:11.143 --> 20:15.512
I thought... OK.
I guess that was a lie, too. Right?

20:15.581 --> 20:17.776
It's complicated.

20:17.849 --> 20:21.876
- Anyway, what can I do?
- Marshall had a program to track the 1 2,

20:21.954 --> 20:25.583
and I ran it through decryption,
but he's got so many security protocols.

20:25.657 --> 20:28.524
- Can l?
- Yeah, sure.

20:33.465 --> 20:34.830
(computer beeps)

20:34.900 --> 20:37.061
- You're in.
- What was it?

20:37.135 --> 20:41.333
- "Moonglum of Elwher."
- That was my next guess.

20:42.241 --> 20:48.612
He's rereading all his favorite books
to get ready for when Mitchell reads.

20:48.680 --> 20:50.705
Anyway, so what else can I do?

20:50.782 --> 20:53.444
Aaargh!

20:56.154 --> 20:59.988
Peyton, would you mind giving us
a moment alone?

21:09.368 --> 21:13.361
You want to see your family again,
don't you?

21:13.438 --> 21:17.306
Don't be difficult.
Think about your son.

21:20.345 --> 21:23.473
No, Marshall, you're not cut out for this.

21:26.518 --> 21:29.954
I never liked you.

21:30.022 --> 21:33.253
I tolerated you, because I had to.

21:33.325 --> 21:39.423
Because you were my superior,
and I was afraid of you.

21:39.498 --> 21:43.798
Then I saw how twisted you were.

21:47.172 --> 21:50.835
But now I see you
for who you really are.

21:50.909 --> 21:54.777
You are a weak, pathetic man.

21:57.149 --> 22:01.882
You know what? You're right.
I'm not cut out for this.

22:01.953 --> 22:05.980
But I am thinking about my son.

22:06.058 --> 22:10.495
I want Mitchell to look up to me.

22:10.562 --> 22:12.792
To be proud of his dad.

22:15.067 --> 22:18.935
Which is why no matter
what you do to me,

22:19.004 --> 22:21.029
I will never help you.

22:26.178 --> 22:30.638
You know, I got a hangnail,
right there on my thumb.

22:30.716 --> 22:33.776
You mind working on that one next?

22:39.925 --> 22:42.917
(Nadia) Marshall's right about you.

22:44.629 --> 22:49.692
- I'm doing what needs to be done.
- Does that help you sleep at night?

22:49.768 --> 22:53.204
Eventually, Marshall and Rachel
will do what I ask.

22:53.271 --> 22:56.206
No, they won't.

22:56.274 --> 22:58.538
- Why not?
- They have something you don't.

22:58.610 --> 23:04.310
- What?
- Love. Family. Honor. Take your pick.

23:04.383 --> 23:08.615
- That's why you'll never break them.
- You're right.

23:10.055 --> 23:13.582
I need to find another way.

23:16.628 --> 23:19.062
- What about airports?
- We've notified the FAA.

23:19.131 --> 23:21.190
I assume Sloane
would have other means.

23:21.266 --> 23:25.100
I'm taking lsabelle to the sitter's.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

23:35.313 --> 23:39.613
If you try anything,
be advised it will end badly.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.945
What do you want?

23:44.022 --> 23:48.118
Talk to Marshall, he'll listen to you.

23:48.193 --> 23:50.184
They didn't do what you wanted.

23:50.262 --> 23:55.325
You have an opportunity to save their lives.
I suggest you take it.

23:55.801 --> 23:57.063
- Syd!
- Marshall.

23:57.135 --> 23:59.603
Find Carrie and Mitchell -
make sure they're OK.

23:59.671 --> 24:02.572
- They're fine. Nothing will...
- If anything happens to me,

24:02.641 --> 24:05.405
tell Mitchell I was strong,
so he's proud of his old man.

24:05.477 --> 24:08.605
Tell Carrie to move on
and find someone else.

24:08.680 --> 24:11.706
Marshall, listen to me.

24:11.783 --> 24:14.149
Whatever Sloane is asking,
I want you to do it.

24:14.219 --> 24:17.620
What? Syd, no, I can't.

24:17.689 --> 24:23.389
Marshall, whatever he asks.
Your life is more important.

24:23.462 --> 24:27.762
Now, before I hang up, is there anything
you want me to tell Carrie?

24:27.833 --> 24:31.667
Yeah, actually, I want you
to tell Carrie that I love her.

24:31.736 --> 24:36.435
And that I'll finish reading Littlest Fish
to Mitchell when I get...

24:38.810 --> 24:41.244
You did the right thing.

25:05.403 --> 25:08.668
Why are we here?
I told you I wouldn't help you.

25:08.740 --> 25:12.267
Yes, but he agreed to.
And he needs your help.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.835
- Marshall...
- Rachel?

25:14.913 --> 25:17.279
...I know this is bad,
but we cannot do this.

25:17.349 --> 25:21.342
We have to. I spoke to Sydney,
she understands.

25:21.419 --> 25:24.183
Listen, Rachel,
I'm gonna do this, OK?

25:24.256 --> 25:27.191
Unless you help me leapfrog the system,
it won't work.

25:27.259 --> 25:31.252
- Leapfrog.
- We have to make sure we're not detected.

25:31.329 --> 25:33.456
Or else it'll shut us out.

25:34.599 --> 25:39.502
We'll need to open a bunch of ports.
Don't stay in more than 1 5 seconds each.

25:39.571 --> 25:43.371
That's right.
1 5 seconds is a good idea.

25:43.441 --> 25:47.172
- She's very bright.
- Terrific. Get to it.

25:52.918 --> 25:55.409
That was Sydney.
She was on the phone with Marshall.

25:55.487 --> 25:57.284
- What?
- He's fine.

25:57.355 --> 26:00.654
He passed a message - he'll finish
reading Mitchell The Littlest Fish

26:00.725 --> 26:02.716
when he gets home.

26:02.794 --> 26:05.422
- We haven't read that book in a year.
- What's it about?

26:05.497 --> 26:09.263
It's about a goldfish,
and some boy who's his friend.

26:09.334 --> 26:12.792
His name is Niles. No, Noah.

26:14.739 --> 26:18.698
NOAA. National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration.

26:18.777 --> 26:22.508
- They monitor weather, eco-systems.
- Using a state-of-the-art satellite.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.572
Maybe Sloane wants them to hack in.

26:24.649 --> 26:27.777
I can set up some wires
to monitor the hack. If I can detect them,

26:27.852 --> 26:30.446
I can pinpoint their location.

26:30.522 --> 26:33.423
- It's happening now.
- I'll be fast.

26:35.894 --> 26:39.193
- Any progress?
- They're close.

26:44.569 --> 26:47.299
The firewall's flagging network activity.

26:47.372 --> 26:51.468
Someone's sending out signatures.
It's Marshall.

26:51.543 --> 26:54.706
He's intentionally triggering
the network security protocols.

26:54.779 --> 26:57.748
Can you trace the location?

26:58.683 --> 27:01.811
That's it.

27:01.886 --> 27:04.616
- Where is it?
- Central ltaly.

27:05.256 --> 27:07.747
Zoom out.

27:12.931 --> 27:15.695
I should have known.

27:17.869 --> 27:22.169
- What happens now?
- Good work... as usual.

27:25.010 --> 27:27.979
I'm narrowing it down.
Mexico.

27:28.046 --> 27:31.345
- They're in lxtapa.
- I'll assemble a rescue team immediately.

27:32.884 --> 27:36.980
I've convened the 1 2.
They're eagerly anticipating our arrival.

27:37.055 --> 27:39.853
The jet's waiting, we should get going.

27:39.924 --> 27:43.291
We should reconsider
our plans for the prisoners.

27:43.361 --> 27:45.829
Don't tell me you're getting sentimental.

27:45.897 --> 27:51.802
- Or do you just have a thing for blondes?
- It simply seems unnecessary, that's all.

27:51.870 --> 27:55.499
This isn't open for discussion.
Eliminate them.

28:03.515 --> 28:07.212
Where are they?
You think they just left?

28:09.721 --> 28:12.417
Rachel, what's wrong?
Are you having a heart attack?

28:12.490 --> 28:16.984
- Exposure to electricity? Rachel?
- No, not a heart attack.

28:17.062 --> 28:19.462
What are you doing?

28:20.732 --> 28:24.190
- What is that? You carry a garrote?
- It's an underwire.

28:24.269 --> 28:26.737
Sometimes it pays to be a girl.

28:28.707 --> 28:31.471
Um, Rachel... Hey!

28:31.543 --> 28:34.376
Listen, I have a family, OK?
And a child.

28:34.446 --> 28:37.074
I want another one.
Maybe even a girl.

28:44.756 --> 28:47.691
Oh, my God.
That was the coolest thing I've ever seen.

28:47.759 --> 28:50.159
Seriously, that was
Empire Strikes Back cool.

28:50.228 --> 28:51.695
Let's get out of here.

28:55.500 --> 28:57.866
- Hey!
- Get down!

29:04.609 --> 29:08.511
Oh, my God. Syd! Thank you.
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

29:12.217 --> 29:16.916
- How did you find us?
- Your wife, Marshall. Carrie found you.

29:17.822 --> 29:21.053
- Any sign of Sloane?
- We checked the entire facility.

29:21.126 --> 29:24.254
He's not here.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.125
I think you should see this.

29:31.202 --> 29:34.729
Marshall's program to track the 1 2
was designed to notify him

29:34.806 --> 29:37.366
should anything significant happen.

29:37.442 --> 29:41.242
- It's pretty significant, if you ask me.
- They're gathering.

29:41.312 --> 29:43.712
(phone rings)

29:44.716 --> 29:47.310
- Bristow.
- Hey, Dad. Marshall and Rachel are good.

29:47.385 --> 29:51.879
- They got to them. Marshall's safe.
- Thank God.

29:51.956 --> 29:55.585
But Sloane, Sark, Peyton - they're gone.

29:55.660 --> 29:57.753
The 1 2 are meeting in Zurich.

29:57.829 --> 30:00.992
Sloane's presenting the information
Marshall and Rachel acquired.

30:01.065 --> 30:05.092
This is what we've been waiting for.
We can bring them all down.

30:05.170 --> 30:09.300
I know. I'll alert our contacts,
have them assemble in Zurich.

30:09.374 --> 30:12.366
Sydney, it's almost over.

30:15.413 --> 30:21.841
Then I told him to move to my hangnail.
He didn't think Flinkman had it in him.

30:21.920 --> 30:25.185
- He's such a jerk.
- I could think of some other words.

30:25.256 --> 30:28.191
You were mapping caves in ltaly.
Do you have the coordinates?

30:28.259 --> 30:30.250
- Yeah.
- That's the other thing.

30:30.328 --> 30:33.786
We spent hours hacking into the system.
When he gets it, he's all cryptic.

30:33.865 --> 30:36.095
"l should have known."
What was that?

30:36.167 --> 30:38.829
- He should've known?
- That's what he said.

30:38.903 --> 30:42.168
- Where in ltaly? What region?
- Umbria.

30:42.941 --> 30:45.034
Mount Subasio.

30:45.109 --> 30:47.509
Dad's team will
take care of the 1 2 in Zurich.

30:47.579 --> 30:50.173
If they're going to Mount Subasio,
I'll beat them to it.

30:50.248 --> 30:52.808
- Sydney.
- You were right, Vaughn.

30:52.884 --> 30:56.285
I can't give in to this idea
that I'm powerless.

30:56.354 --> 30:59.221
- I can bring them down.
- I know.

30:59.290 --> 31:01.884
I was gonna say I'll go with you.

31:06.931 --> 31:08.922
(helicopter)

31:36.494 --> 31:37.859
Vaughn!

31:54.479 --> 31:57.209
Vaughn! Over here!

31:58.449 --> 32:01.577
You'll have to lower me.

32:02.954 --> 32:07.254
- You sure about this?
- Yeah, I am.

32:20.705 --> 32:23.037
I'll be tracking you.

32:23.107 --> 32:25.098
(beeps)

33:39.851 --> 33:41.045
(beeps)

34:03.374 --> 34:05.365
(rumbling)

34:28.065 --> 34:30.159
Sydney.

34:32.270 --> 34:35.569
You came.

34:38.009 --> 34:40.375
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

34:40.445 --> 34:44.245
The sound of one shot
will trigger a cave-in.

34:47.251 --> 34:50.277
You're coming with me.

34:51.621 --> 34:55.649
Remember when you were a little girl
and you came to live with Emily and me?

34:55.726 --> 34:59.958
- I try not to dwell on it.
- Sydney, you were so withdrawn.

35:00.031 --> 35:04.968
We understood. You lost your mother
and your father was taken into custody.

35:05.036 --> 35:06.264
Remember?

35:07.572 --> 35:13.533
We tried to reach out, but there was
a time when that was impossible.

35:15.046 --> 35:20.780
So we lined the shelves of your room -
all of them - with stuffed animals...

35:20.852 --> 35:24.288
hoping that that would comfort you.

35:24.355 --> 35:28.485
Every morning I would come into
your room to wake you up.

35:28.559 --> 35:33.428
There they were,
buried underneath your blanket.

35:33.498 --> 35:38.902
You said there was a storm in the middle
of the night and it knocked them over.

35:38.970 --> 35:42.167
They were drowning.

35:43.674 --> 35:47.303
So one by one you rescued them.

35:48.946 --> 35:53.212
Even then, I wondered
when you would learn.

35:53.284 --> 35:55.684
You can't rescue everyone.

36:04.829 --> 36:08.230
I received word from Zurich.
The team's outside the building.

36:08.299 --> 36:11.166
- We're getting visuals soon.
- We got a problem.

36:11.235 --> 36:13.795
This is from Sloane's safe house.
Look at this.

36:13.871 --> 36:18.001
- A schematic of the L.A. subway system.
- Data engineering analysis.

36:18.075 --> 36:21.636
He's mapping architectural weaknesses
of the tunnels around our facility.

36:21.712 --> 36:24.772
- Sloane's targeting APO.
- Clear the building.

36:24.849 --> 36:28.512
Tom, Dixon - organize a search team.
Sweep the tunnels.

36:28.586 --> 36:32.352
Marshall, Rachel - I want all civilians
evacuated from the subway.

36:32.423 --> 36:37.292
- How do we do that?
- Call in a bomb threat.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.565
(Sloane) I know Marshall
gave you a message.

36:43.634 --> 36:47.297
But it didn't matter
because I accounted for everyone.

36:47.371 --> 36:49.362
What do you mean, everyone?

36:51.175 --> 36:54.440
(Sloane) Prophet Five. APO.

36:56.113 --> 36:59.571
I had to remove those obstacles.

36:59.650 --> 37:06.146
- If you touch anyone else I love...
- The time for threats has passed.

37:07.024 --> 37:09.754
Besides, even if I wanted to
I couldn't stop it now.

37:15.666 --> 37:19.534
Mr. Sloane couldn't make it,
he sent me instead.

37:25.076 --> 37:28.739
I'm making sure that this is
going to happen. That I'll see this through.

37:28.813 --> 37:31.976
You, above all, should understand that.

37:32.049 --> 37:35.507
- There's no shying away from fate.
- I don't believe in fate.

37:35.586 --> 37:38.419
Be that as it may,
I'm very glad you're here, Sydney.

37:38.489 --> 37:41.390
I wouldn't want you to be there
when it happens.

37:41.459 --> 37:43.450
What have you done?

38:10.588 --> 38:14.217
(beeping)

38:19.330 --> 38:22.322
I found it. It's big.

38:25.670 --> 38:30.869
I never wanted you to suffer
the way you did when you were a child.

38:30.941 --> 38:33.967
The way you suffered
when you lost Danny.

38:34.045 --> 38:37.572
When you lost Vaughn.

38:37.648 --> 38:43.052
- How much longer till we're evacuated?
- They need five more minutes.

38:43.120 --> 38:46.851
- Can you disable it?
- Not without triggering the fail-safe.

38:46.924 --> 38:52.658
The timer is a quartz oscillator.
I can slow it down, buy them the time.

38:52.730 --> 38:56.427
- Are you sure?
- I've got liquid nitrogen.

38:56.500 --> 39:00.163
- I can freeze the mechanism.
- lt'll only buy you 20 seconds.

39:01.739 --> 39:07.336
- Not if I stay here and keep hitting it.
- All right, do what you can.

39:07.411 --> 39:11.006
But the second that timer
dips below a minute, get the hell out.

39:11.082 --> 39:12.481
Will do.

39:35.239 --> 39:39.232
- I'm assuming you have the amulet?
- Of course.

40:01.632 --> 40:06.194
Sydney, I'm offering you a chance...

40:06.270 --> 40:08.261
to walk.

40:08.906 --> 40:15.869
- You know I can't do that.
- You can only rescue yourself.

40:20.084 --> 40:22.382
(sirens)

40:28.559 --> 40:34.054
- Jack, what's the status on the evac?
- The civilians just made it out.

40:36.233 --> 40:39.532
- Good.
- Don't lose your window. Get up top now!

40:39.603 --> 40:41.036
OK.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.840
Will do.

40:51.882 --> 40:53.873
Hey, listen.

40:55.352 --> 40:57.411
- Patch me through to Rachel?
- Copy.

40:59.457 --> 41:03.325
- Tom, you need to get out.
- Yeah.

41:05.196 --> 41:07.596
Hey, Rachel...

41:08.265 --> 41:10.790
I wish there were more time.

41:12.937 --> 41:14.928
I would've asked you out.

41:18.108 --> 41:21.134
I would have said yes.

41:54.778 --> 41:55.767
Hm.

41:57.748 --> 41:59.739
A sky.

42:10.094 --> 42:14.155
I'm sorry, Sydney, this isn't my choice.
You're not allowed to see this.
