<i>LIV: Previously on iZombie...</i>

00:02.836 --> 00:03.917
Is that the dominatrix case?

00:04.129 --> 00:05.245
You're prosecuting Weckler?

00:05.464 --> 00:06.625
Strange case.

00:06.840 --> 00:09.173
He confessed even though you
didn't have much hard evidence.

00:09.384 --> 00:11.296
The cure works,
my memory is back.

00:11.887 --> 00:13.469
Turns out Blaine's been
lying this whole time.

00:13.680 --> 00:14.921
He never lost his memory?

00:15.098 --> 00:16.589
There's a batch
waiting at the morgue.

00:16.767 --> 00:18.975
I can barely even remember
what being human is like.

00:19.186 --> 00:20.017
RAVI: Liv.

00:20.395 --> 00:22.182
The syringes...
They're gone.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.180
I gave you a syringe
a few weeks back.

00:24.399 --> 00:26.641
It's the last one, and we need it
for Liv. Do you have it with you?

00:26.860 --> 00:27.941
I gave it to someone.

00:28.445 --> 00:29.526
To whom?

00:35.994 --> 00:37.701
I gave the cure to Natalie.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.241
I'm so sorry.

00:40.832 --> 00:42.073
Who's Natalie?

00:42.376 --> 00:43.992
Major's zombie hooker friend.

00:44.503 --> 00:45.414
Liv...

00:45.629 --> 00:47.040
No. I'm sorry.

00:47.256 --> 00:49.339
That's not fair. It doesn't
matter what she was.

00:49.758 --> 00:51.294
I thought there were
another 16 doses.

00:51.510 --> 00:52.591
I was just trying to save her.

00:52.803 --> 00:54.635
This is Blaine's fault,
not yours.

00:54.846 --> 00:56.803
If he hadn't been faking
this memory loss,

00:57.015 --> 00:58.881
I would've taken the
cure months ago.

00:59.101 --> 01:01.809
Now that rat bastard has
stolen the rest of the doses.

01:02.020 --> 01:04.137
The thief may not be Blaine.

01:04.397 --> 01:07.141
Don E. just offered me $50,000
for a dose of the cure.

01:07.359 --> 01:09.146
He said some zombie
offered him 100 grand.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.314
It's Blaine.

01:10.529 --> 01:11.519
And if I find him,

01:11.738 --> 01:13.604
I will beat a confession
out of him.

01:13.824 --> 01:14.439

01:14.658 --> 01:16.024
He's still got his regular
singing gig tonight.

01:17.578 --> 01:20.912
Look, I don't think this hot mess
brain has completely worn off.

01:21.123 --> 01:22.409
This is me, Ravi.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.199
This is me
controlling my anger.

01:26.211 --> 01:28.203
But I can just picture him.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.629
Smug.

A drug dealer.

03:47.978 --> 03:50.721
No they don't
just breath fire.

03:50.939 --> 03:51.895
So why don't you try it.

Why don't you share

There are children!

04:25.223 --> 04:27.510
Yeah? Did you come
to breast feed them all?

04:27.726 --> 04:29.183
Is that why your boobs
are half out? No.

to the pick-up circle

04:31.772 --> 04:33.764

banging my boyfriend.

These panties just like yours.

04:43.867 --> 04:44.778

haven't arrived, yet?

05:08.642 --> 05:10.099

What happened?
The cure didn't work?

05:39.256 --> 05:41.919
It was stolen.
Can we talk about it later?

05:44.845 --> 05:45.710
Ew!

05:47.138 --> 05:50.631
This is Jamie Brennan. Thirty-two
years old. Preschool teacher.

05:50.851 --> 05:51.967
Carpentry accident?

05:54.437 --> 05:56.394
I was thinking of ruling it
a homicide.

06:03.113 --> 06:05.480
No forced entry.
Victim likely knew his killer.

06:05.699 --> 06:06.815
Sheets were stolen
from his bed.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.444
Appears to be a crime
of passion.

06:08.660 --> 06:09.491
You think?

06:09.744 --> 06:11.235
I mean, one nail
in the head

06:11.454 --> 06:14.413
could be a financial dispute.
But the bonus 13 nails?

06:14.666 --> 06:15.998
Someone was irked.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.542
Guys at that construction site
across the street

06:19.170 --> 06:20.706
tell us they're
missing a nail gun.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.083
My theory?

06:22.299 --> 06:24.006
Jamie's night started
romantic in the bedroom,

06:24.217 --> 06:25.333
then things went south.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.339
Killer left angry,
went across the street,

06:27.554 --> 06:28.385
found the nail gun.

06:28.597 --> 06:31.681
Came back and popped Jamie
when he answered the door.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.966
Hey, you think we can
get the killer's height

06:34.185 --> 06:35.847
from the angle of the nails?

06:36.730 --> 06:39.689
Sure, if you can tell me which
of the 14 nails went in first.

06:43.612 --> 06:45.945
What can you tell me
about STD 36?

06:46.406 --> 06:48.989
Nothing. But only
because STD number one

06:49.200 --> 06:50.691
taught me some hard lessons.

06:52.287 --> 06:53.698
Don't look at me.

06:53.914 --> 06:54.904
Why do you ask?

07:03.423 --> 07:05.460
Something? Nothing?

07:05.926 --> 07:07.667
I can think of one way
we can figure it out.

07:11.514 --> 07:12.630
Who me?

07:29.532 --> 07:31.444
This is the right room,
isn't it?

07:32.035 --> 07:32.695
Shut the door!

07:33.286 --> 07:34.402
The guinea pig got out.

07:35.914 --> 07:37.655
Don't worry.
I'll help find him.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.246
I'm really good at
finding things.

07:42.712 --> 07:43.702
What are you good at?

07:43.922 --> 07:44.878
I'm sorry?

07:45.090 --> 07:47.582
Detective Babineaux is really
good at asking people questions.

07:47.801 --> 07:48.882
As a matter of fact,

07:49.094 --> 07:51.051
he's got some questions
to ask right now.

07:52.597 --> 07:55.135
Oh, of course. I'm sorry.

07:55.350 --> 07:57.307
The kids are reeling
from Jamie's death

07:57.519 --> 08:00.762
and I don't think they would be able
to take losing Choochie Bean too.

08:00.981 --> 08:04.440
I'm sure my colleague will locate
the guinea pig, Mrs. Zelinsky.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.275
Now, what can you tell us
about Jamie?

08:08.488 --> 08:10.195
He was the best teacher
I've ever observed.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.649
Did Jamie have any enemies
that you know of?

08:13.159 --> 08:14.445
I was afraid you'd ask that.

08:14.661 --> 08:17.620
Jamie was...

08:17.831 --> 08:19.197
Mrs. Zelinsky,

08:19.416 --> 08:22.909
don't you know police officers
are your friends?

08:24.462 --> 08:25.748
I know they are!

08:28.425 --> 08:30.007
Jamie was a womanizer.

08:30.218 --> 08:33.177
Every year he had affairs
with the mothers in his class.

08:33.722 --> 08:35.839
This year alone, he was seeing

08:36.057 --> 08:37.423
three of the
students' mothers.

08:37.808 --> 08:38.674
You said three?

08:39.227 --> 08:41.219
Do you know who
these three women were?

08:43.106 --> 08:45.439
Hi, Piper, I'm Liv Moore.

08:45.817 --> 08:48.480
Detective Babineaux's friend
from the M.E.'s office.

08:48.695 --> 08:51.153
Do you know why we asked you
to come on down here today?

08:51.364 --> 08:52.980
To talk about Jamie.

08:53.241 --> 08:54.607
That's correct!

08:54.868 --> 08:57.155
It's our understanding that
you were dating Jamie.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.033
And that you had a nasty
fight with him yesterday.

09:00.248 --> 09:02.831
I thought Jamie
and I were exclusive.

09:03.168 --> 09:06.002
Then I found Macy Stonem's
panties under his bed.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.373
Is that why I'm here?

09:07.589 --> 09:09.000
Did that bitch point
the finger at me?

09:09.215 --> 09:10.797
Hands on top. Everybody stop.

09:12.677 --> 09:13.963
Hands on top, guys.

09:14.179 --> 09:15.511
What is this?
What is she doing?

09:15.722 --> 09:17.338
What I'm doing is
giving you a time out.

09:17.557 --> 09:21.016
- Because what you're doing is being unkind.
- (SCOFFS)

09:21.227 --> 09:22.638
It's okay to be mad, Piper.

09:22.854 --> 09:24.345
Something terrible
has happened.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.647
But using bad words isn't
going to help anything.

09:26.858 --> 09:28.349
What made you think the
panties were Macy's?

09:28.568 --> 09:29.979
Bup! Bup, bup, bup.

09:30.195 --> 09:31.686
I'm sorry, Clive.
Piper's on a time out.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.363
When the big hand is on the 11
she can answer you.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.940
- I'm giving her a pass.
- But I...

09:36.159 --> 09:37.400
The panties?

09:37.619 --> 09:39.281
Apparently, they might be
Eleanor's.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.078
She came out of nowhere.

09:41.289 --> 09:42.450
I still think they're Macy's,

09:42.665 --> 09:43.872
because she used
to be a dancer

09:44.042 --> 09:45.249
and there were
ballet slippers on them.

09:45.460 --> 09:46.917
Macy is married with kids,

09:47.128 --> 09:48.869
and she just walks around
wearing a lycra halter top

09:49.089 --> 09:51.672
like every day is a
Vegas bachelorette party.

09:51.883 --> 09:52.839
Macy's married?

09:53.051 --> 09:54.132
So is Eleanor.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.131
Super classy, right?

09:57.055 --> 09:59.342
Don't forget to ask Piper
about her alibi.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.219
I was at home all night
with my kid,

10:04.437 --> 10:05.973
he had a stomach bug.

10:06.314 --> 10:08.727
Is there an adult who can
corroborate your whereabouts?

10:09.984 --> 10:11.520
I'm a single parent.

10:11.736 --> 10:12.943
I'm on my own.

10:13.530 --> 10:16.238
I thought Jamie was going to
change that.

10:17.283 --> 10:21.152
I thought I was finally
dating a nice guy for once.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.536
He listened to my voice like

10:23.748 --> 10:25.956
it was the only sound
in the universe.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.370
You know, I told Macy I was
falling in love with him.

10:30.588 --> 10:31.999
And she screwed him anyway.

10:32.215 --> 10:34.207
Because she was bored.

10:47.438 --> 10:48.770
She wasn't so great.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.903
We've got orders stacking up.

10:56.114 --> 10:57.650
It's time to make the donuts.

11:01.202 --> 11:03.319
What's it all about, Candy?

11:07.041 --> 11:08.953
Well, I think today
is about collecting

11:09.169 --> 11:11.286
125 grand in brain fees.

11:55.924 --> 11:57.586
When have I ever cared
what you do?

12:02.805 --> 12:04.671
It doesn't

history of violence.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.687
Too many details don't
add up in this case.

12:17.695 --> 12:18.731
Ms. Charles?

12:21.074 --> 12:23.191
I understand your
client's income

12:23.451 --> 12:25.488
isn't ideal for paying
sex workers in cash,

12:25.703 --> 12:26.910
but sound decision making

12:27.121 --> 12:28.737
isn't exactly his strong suit,
is it?

12:28.957 --> 12:30.198
For example,
when Ms. Greer

12:30.416 --> 12:31.532
caught him stealing
her memory card,

12:31.793 --> 12:34.126
Weckler's solution was
to strangle her.

12:34.337 --> 12:36.294
I know this because
he confessed to it.

12:36.506 --> 12:38.589
Glad you brought up
the confession.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.087
Were you aware
that Mr. Weckler has

12:41.302 --> 12:42.884
a history of mental illness.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.429
I'm liking my chances getting
that confession tossed out.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.381
And without it,
your case is flimsy.

12:47.558 --> 12:49.515
Mr. Weckler used
the BDSM footage

12:49.727 --> 12:51.389
he stole from
the dominatrix dungeon

12:51.604 --> 12:53.596
to extort money from
a local news anchor.

12:53.815 --> 12:56.558
I believe the jury will find
his critical thinking skills

12:56.818 --> 12:58.184
fully functional.

12:58.444 --> 13:01.312
Now, if Weckler wants to
cough up that memory card

13:01.531 --> 13:02.988
I might consider
reducing charges.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.024
I would love
to make that happen.

13:05.243 --> 13:07.610
But Weckler's been fighting me
on the memory card.

13:07.829 --> 13:09.570
I'd be happy to
join the fight.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.371
Does tomorrow afternoon work?

13:15.295 --> 13:17.127
Baracus doesn't mind
us raiding his pantry?

13:17.922 --> 13:18.912
He told us to.

13:20.466 --> 13:21.673
Ooh.

13:21.884 --> 13:24.092
Rare hot sauces
from around the world.

13:25.096 --> 13:26.177
Stuff we can't afford.

13:26.723 --> 13:27.429
Sir.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.219
Mr. Future Mayor.

13:30.435 --> 13:32.427
Mr. Alternate Reality Mayor,
maybe.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.227
I'm down 15 points.

13:34.439 --> 13:37.273
Anymore intel on the
gun-toting, Internet crazies?

13:37.483 --> 13:39.941
Same as before,
still heavily armed.

13:40.194 --> 13:41.355
Still out to get anyone
rescued from

13:41.571 --> 13:42.402
Max Rager's basement.

13:42.613 --> 13:44.070
Well, that is a bummer.

13:45.533 --> 13:46.444
Goodnight, gentlemen.

13:46.659 --> 13:47.991
- Night.
- Night.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.538
I hope both those plates
are for you.

13:53.750 --> 13:54.911
I already ate.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.210
You hear the rumor
about a zombie speakeasy?

14:03.926 --> 14:05.167
Zack swears it's true.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.592
- He's leading an expedition there tomorrow night.
- Yeah.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.092
He wants us to go with.

14:10.558 --> 14:11.264
Okay.

14:19.317 --> 14:20.273
Mmm.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.900
Dude, this sauce is Tibetan.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.527
Have the Tibetan people
ever let you down?

14:28.951 --> 14:29.691
Never.

14:29.911 --> 14:31.197
Come on man. Just try it.

14:31.662 --> 14:33.324
Nah, really, man. I'm full.

14:33.581 --> 14:34.537
You're full?

14:40.046 --> 14:41.378
(SOFTLY) Or you're human?

14:44.550 --> 14:46.086
When I took you
to Ravi and Liv,

14:46.302 --> 14:47.759
when you were in bad shape.

14:47.970 --> 14:50.007
They talked about
giving you a cure.

14:55.686 --> 14:57.097
Yeah, I'm human.

14:57.313 --> 14:59.054
Oh.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.690
But I don't want
that to change anything.

15:01.943 --> 15:03.559
I can't believe
there's a cure...

15:03.778 --> 15:06.191
- How is that even possible?
- It's not anymore.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.156
Look, Ravi engineered it
with tainted Utopium

15:09.325 --> 15:10.611
that he can't replicate.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.363
And the only 15 doses
of the cure

15:12.578 --> 15:14.069
that we had left, were stolen.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.909
Hmm, okay...

15:17.875 --> 15:20.538
So, is doing mercenary work
a good idea for you?

15:20.753 --> 15:23.370
There'll be plenty of jobs
where you don't get shot.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.668
Not after you're accused
of being a serial killer.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.624
There's nowhere else
I'd rather be than

15:27.844 --> 15:29.051
at Fillmore-Graves.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.010
Nowhere.

15:31.973 --> 15:33.930
You planning on telling
anyone else?

15:34.350 --> 15:36.057
Any of our superiors?

15:36.269 --> 15:37.350
They'd kick me out.

15:37.562 --> 15:38.598
Yeah.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.263
Think you can keep
this between us?

15:42.942 --> 15:45.275
Yeah, your secret's safe
with me, man.

15:55.746 --> 15:57.908
By the time Piper told me
she was falling for Jamie,

15:58.124 --> 16:00.081
I'd been sleeping
with him for months.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.326
I didn't have
the heart to tell her.

16:02.545 --> 16:05.913
But I wasn't about to end
my arrangement with Jamie.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.831
The sex was incredible.

16:08.050 --> 16:10.212
And the pillow talk, well...

16:10.678 --> 16:12.260
No one listened
quite like Jamie.

16:13.306 --> 16:14.797
So we've heard.

16:15.016 --> 16:16.882
<i>Listening es muy importante.</i>

16:17.101 --> 16:19.263
You can learn something new
every day if you listen.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.597
<i>Like the verb to listen in
Spanish. Escuchar.</i>

16:24.400 --> 16:25.891
Jamie's time of death
was between

16:26.068 --> 16:27.525
10:00 p.m. and midnight.
Where were you?

16:27.695 --> 16:30.483
At home with Will,
that's my husband.

16:30.698 --> 16:32.690
So you know, when we
confirm your whereabouts

16:32.909 --> 16:34.241
with your husband,

16:34.410 --> 16:35.400
we'll have to let him know

16:35.620 --> 16:37.077
about your relationship
with Jamie.

16:37.288 --> 16:38.904
Will's in the waiting room
right now,

16:39.123 --> 16:40.284
if you want to talk to him.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.956
My wife and I were at home
the night of the murder.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.504
The usual,
dinner, put the kids to bed.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.756
I'm afraid I have to break
some bad news to you...

16:49.967 --> 16:52.675
Remember, none of this
is your fault, buddy.

16:52.887 --> 16:54.423
But you and Macy are
persons of interest

16:54.639 --> 16:56.881
in this case because Macy

16:57.099 --> 16:58.840
was having an affair
with Jamie.

17:01.229 --> 17:03.391
Of course. I wondered why
you wanted to talk to me.

17:03.648 --> 17:04.809
Did Macy not tell you?

17:05.023 --> 17:08.188
My wife and I have
an open relationship.

17:08.402 --> 17:10.018
I knew all about her thing
with Jamie.

17:10.238 --> 17:13.026
Hell, a lot of the time,
I'd watch them

17:14.367 --> 17:15.653
from the closet.

17:15.867 --> 17:18.326
The closet's right next to
the bed so, I...

17:18.538 --> 17:20.325
Quiet coyote!

17:20.915 --> 17:21.655
I don't understand.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.036
Ears open, mouth closed,
stop, listen and learn.

17:25.752 --> 17:27.540
I think we have all
the information we need.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.961
Mr. Weckler, you confessed to
the murder of Roxanne Greer.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.212
And you were
caught blackmailing

17:33.427 --> 17:34.759
TV personality Johnny Frost.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.928
As long as you retain
that memory card,

17:37.139 --> 17:38.801
a key piece of evidence,

17:39.433 --> 17:40.674
the potential for
blackmail remains.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.977
Ms. Charles has offered
a fair plea deal, James.

17:44.188 --> 17:45.770
I'm urging you to take it.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.608
That memory card is the
only thing keeping me alive.

17:52.989 --> 17:55.356
Wait, what do you
mean by that?

17:57.535 --> 17:58.366
Harry?

17:59.328 --> 18:00.444
Ms. Charles.

18:01.831 --> 18:03.993
Excuse me a moment
while I talk to my client.

18:05.126 --> 18:06.537
Excuse me, Harry.

18:06.752 --> 18:07.833
This is my client.

18:08.045 --> 18:09.035
Mr. Thorne?

18:11.549 --> 18:12.460
You're fired.

18:13.551 --> 18:15.008
Mr. Thorne's my lawyer now.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.669
Ms. Charles, a word?

18:23.311 --> 18:24.768
What's the offer on the table?

18:25.688 --> 18:26.895
Murder two and blackmail.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.306
Thirty years if he pleas out.

18:30.359 --> 18:31.520
When James hands over
the memory card,

18:31.736 --> 18:34.649
I'll drop the blackmail charge
and knock 10 years off.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.277
We're good with murder two
and blackmail.

18:39.827 --> 18:43.116
The memory card in question
doesn't exist.

18:43.456 --> 18:44.947
Good doing business with you.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.995
Guard. You can take my
client back to County.

18:49.503 --> 18:51.540
I thought Jamie
and I were in love.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.876
I thought I was the only one.

18:54.467 --> 18:55.833
To have an affair...

18:56.052 --> 18:57.634
This isn't something I do.

18:57.803 --> 19:00.716
My husband travels for months
at a time on a fishing boat.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.047
On a fishing boat?

19:02.266 --> 19:03.552
How exciting?

19:03.851 --> 19:06.639
Can you think of another job where
a person would work on a boat?

19:06.854 --> 19:07.844
Stop.

19:08.898 --> 19:11.060
My husband, he works
really hard,

19:11.275 --> 19:12.857
he doesn't have time
to hear my problems...

19:13.069 --> 19:16.858
But Jamie...
I could tell him anything.

19:17.073 --> 19:18.609
Most people
just hear, Jamie...

19:19.241 --> 19:20.277
He really listened.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.701
Yeah. Seems like Jamie had
listening down to a fine art.

19:22.912 --> 19:23.777
Eleanor.

19:24.580 --> 19:25.570
The night Jamie was murdered,

19:25.790 --> 19:27.827
where were you between
10:00 p.m. and midnight?

19:28.042 --> 19:30.409
Greg just got back
from a trip.

19:30.628 --> 19:31.960
We were home watching movies.

19:32.213 --> 19:34.455
Okay. We have to confirm that
with your husband.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.916
Meaning, we have to tell him
about the affair.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.292
Is that really necessary?

19:38.511 --> 19:40.594
I mean, can't you just confirm
that I was with him?

19:40.805 --> 19:43.138
I'm sorry. We need to clear
him as a suspect, too.

19:45.142 --> 19:46.383
Don't worry, Eleanor.

19:47.937 --> 19:49.428
Greg will vouch for you!

19:49.605 --> 19:51.938
He loves you!

19:52.650 --> 19:53.936
Ellie was at home
with me that night.

19:54.610 --> 19:55.566
All night.

19:56.278 --> 19:57.610
Why do you need to know
where Ellie was the night

19:57.822 --> 19:59.029
my kid's teacher was killed?

19:59.240 --> 20:02.028
Mr. McKenna, I'm sorry
to have to tell you this,

20:02.243 --> 20:06.362
but Eleanor was having
an affair with Jamie.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.098
(MEN WHOOPING)

as a zombie speakeasy.

There's no sign.

That's how you know it's cool!

20:58.632 --> 20:59.588
It's locked.

Ah.

21:27.912 --> 21:29.244
All right, come on.
Let's do it.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.196
Here we go.

21:31.874 --> 21:33.456
All right big man.
Come on, let's go.

Listen, there's no good
way to ask this

23:37.583 --> 23:38.699
so I'm just gonna
put it out there.

23:40.169 --> 23:41.000
Okay.

23:42.171 --> 23:43.002
Liv?

23:44.548 --> 23:46.881
Hey, you dead bitches!

23:47.092 --> 23:49.425
Are we having fun yet?

23:49.637 --> 23:51.344
ALL: Whooo!

23:51.513 --> 23:53.175
Don E. runs a zombie bar?

23:53.390 --> 23:55.427
He doesn't exactly give off
an upper-management vibe.

23:55.601 --> 23:58.890
I'd say more of a huffed paint at
critical developmental stages vibe.

23:59.146 --> 24:00.557
The place is
wall-to-wall undead.

24:00.814 --> 24:02.396
Where did all these new
zombies come from?

24:02.608 --> 24:04.565
And where's Don E. getting
brains to feed them all?

24:04.777 --> 24:05.813
I'll ask him

24:06.028 --> 24:08.065
when I ask him about those
stolen doses of the cure.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.816
You're going
down there by yourself?

24:10.199 --> 24:12.532
The place is full of rowdy,
boozed-up, horny zombies.

24:12.743 --> 24:16.111
And frankly, you're not at peak
bad-ass on preschool teacher brain.

24:16.330 --> 24:17.662
You see the potential
in everyone.

24:17.873 --> 24:19.114
You told me I could be
an astronaut

24:19.333 --> 24:20.289
if I studied hard enough.

24:20.501 --> 24:21.537
Me, too!

24:22.419 --> 24:24.206
We don't all want to be
astronauts, Liv.

24:24.421 --> 24:26.287
The point is, you could be.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.001
Or firemen.

24:28.175 --> 24:29.507
Or the President.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.005
You could take Justin.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.967
He's already been there and
he knows how to handle himself.

24:36.100 --> 24:39.719
Also, he asked
my permission to court you.

24:42.773 --> 24:43.889
He did?

24:45.776 --> 24:48.689
Maybe you should explain
my boyfriend history to him.

24:48.904 --> 24:51.442
(SCOFFS) It is sort of like
being the drummer for Spinal Tap.

25:06.338 --> 25:07.829
You told me
we were a team, Jamie.

25:08.048 --> 25:10.290
So, yeah, I got the impression
you were my boyfriend.

25:10.509 --> 25:11.920
You seriously won't let me in?

25:12.136 --> 25:14.093
Piper, you have to go home.

25:14.304 --> 25:15.465
I'm sorry I caused a scene.

25:15.681 --> 25:19.049
Okay? Just, please,
let's talk about it.

25:25.691 --> 25:28.479
Okay. Justin can come with me
to the Scratching Post.

25:28.694 --> 25:29.855
I need to find Clive.

25:38.037 --> 25:40.120
Why do I feel like
I'm in trouble?

25:40.330 --> 25:41.571
Did you tell us everything

25:41.790 --> 25:43.531
the first time we talked
to you, Piper?

25:44.293 --> 25:46.876
Because a witness puts you
at Jamie's front door

25:47.087 --> 25:48.077
on the night of the murder.

25:51.133 --> 25:53.045
I dropped by Jamie's
just for like a minute,

25:53.218 --> 25:55.426
to tell him I wasn't gonna be
with him anymore.

25:55.637 --> 25:58.471
- Son of a bitch already had someone there.
- Any idea who?

25:58.682 --> 26:00.924
I saw a black Civic
parked down the block.

26:01.143 --> 26:04.011
And I'm 99% sure
that's what Eleanor drives.

We have more questions.

26:11.695 --> 26:13.402
Hi, there, what's happening?

26:13.614 --> 26:16.152
(SOFTLY) Piper wasn't telling
Jamie off in my vision,

26:16.366 --> 26:18.323
she wanted to continue
the relationship.

26:18.702 --> 26:20.284
She's a prideful lady.

26:20.954 --> 26:22.286
Maybe pride
got the best of her,

26:22.498 --> 26:23.659
and she came back later,

26:24.124 --> 26:25.660
waited for Eleanor to leave,

26:25.918 --> 26:28.205
then used that nail gun
on Jamie's skull.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.332
We should see if Eleanor
drives a Civic.

I'll be quick, I just want you
to consider joining me.

26:48.607 --> 26:51.224

Disciplinary Counsel.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.854
His hijacking the Weckler case

26:53.070 --> 26:57.030
was unprofessional
and detrimental to the client.

26:58.742 --> 27:01.576
You'd agree to a statement
like that, wouldn't you?

27:01.954 --> 27:03.946
You're taking it pretty hard,
don't you think?

high-dollar lawyers all the time.

You haven't heard?

27:13.257 --> 27:16.045
James Weckler hanged himself
in his cell this morning.

27:25.561 --> 27:28.725
Clive, sometimes we work
so hard solving murders

27:28.939 --> 27:31.101
that we forget to pat
ourselves on the back.

27:31.316 --> 27:33.603
Wouldn't it be amazing if
every time you caught a perp

27:33.819 --> 27:36.653

you got a reward?

owns a black Camry.

Macy thought a Civic
was following them.

he was doing.

29:12.417 --> 29:15.251
Macy seems unlikely, she was
freaked out by being followed.

29:15.462 --> 29:16.794
And if it were Piper,

29:17.005 --> 29:18.917
she wouldn't have tipped us
off to the Civic.

29:19.132 --> 29:21.875

isn't a zombie now?

Uh, I'm looking for Don E.

29:59.089 --> 30:00.671
He should be here soon.

his friend Liv wants to play.

Bloody Mary, spicy.

a Bloody Mary.

may have scarred me for life.

and confiscated it.

30:35.375 --> 30:37.332

that you loved her?

Well, I'll tell
you one thing.

Mrs. Pennybaker
cured me of note-passing.

30:46.887 --> 30:47.843
No!

30:48.555 --> 30:50.717

means of communication

the transaction.

all the doses were stolen.

31:48.990 --> 31:51.232
- But you already know that, don't you?
- What?

31:51.451 --> 31:53.738
Did Ravi tell you that...
Argh.

Argh!

We're investigating the murder
of Jamie Brennan.

35:16.406 --> 35:17.863
I wondered when you guys
were gonna show up.

35:21.620 --> 35:22.451
C'mon.

35:23.788 --> 35:25.154
Please. Sit.

35:28.043 --> 35:29.284
We were curious

35:29.669 --> 35:32.332
why you were parked on Jamie's
street the night he died,

35:32.881 --> 35:34.463
and why he had your
license plate

35:34.633 --> 35:35.749
jotted down on a notepad.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.050
You likely know
what I was doing.

35:38.762 --> 35:40.594
I was working
on behalf of a client.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.256
You want a coffee? Tea?

35:43.808 --> 35:44.673
No.

35:44.893 --> 35:46.100
No, what, Clive?

35:48.104 --> 35:49.094
No, thank you.

35:51.816 --> 35:53.773
And who would this client be,
Mr. Baker?

35:53.985 --> 35:55.897
You know I can't tell
you that, Detective.

35:56.112 --> 35:57.319
Are you really going to make
me find a judge to...

35:57.530 --> 35:59.066
Clive, look.

36:02.285 --> 36:03.776
I'll be damned.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.581
You still think you need
to go see a judge?

36:12.462 --> 36:14.078
No. I think we're good.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.756
You are in big trouble,
young lady.

36:16.966 --> 36:18.958
You're not in an
open relationship.

36:19.844 --> 36:21.676
You're so not
in an open relationship

36:21.888 --> 36:23.754
that your husband hired
a private investigator

36:23.932 --> 36:25.969
to find out
what you were up to.

36:26.476 --> 36:27.307
Remember that Civic you saw

36:27.519 --> 36:29.260
following you on a date
with Jamie?

36:30.939 --> 36:32.020
That was him.

36:33.108 --> 36:33.973
And it gets worse.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.478
Turns out your husband's P.I.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.651
was following you
the night of the murder.

36:37.862 --> 36:40.400
That's who called your husband
and told him where you were.

36:40.573 --> 36:42.109
That's how Will found you.

36:43.284 --> 36:45.776
<i>He probably sits out
there seething.</i>

36:47.122 --> 36:49.364
<i>He works himself up to
a fever pitch.</i>

36:49.582 --> 36:50.493
<i>He finds a weapon at the</i>

36:50.667 --> 36:52.203
<i>construction site
across the street.</i>

36:52.419 --> 36:53.409
<i>He heads to the front door.</i>

36:53.628 --> 36:54.584
<i>Rings the bell.</i>

36:58.383 --> 37:00.545
<i>And that's the last thing
your lover ever did.</i>

37:04.389 --> 37:06.096
You became an accomplice
when you helped Will

37:06.307 --> 37:07.514
cover up the crime.

37:07.726 --> 37:10.059
You got rid of the
incriminating sheets.

37:10.270 --> 37:11.306
You keep lying for him,

37:11.563 --> 37:13.429
you're just adding
years to your sentence.

37:16.735 --> 37:17.816
(EXHALES)

37:18.737 --> 37:20.148
Will killed Jamie.

37:21.448 --> 37:22.609
I saw it all.

37:33.334 --> 37:34.825
Hey, there.

37:35.044 --> 37:38.833
Uh, uh, Liv's out gallivanting
with Clive somewhere.

37:39.007 --> 37:41.044
I'm actually here to see you.

37:42.302 --> 37:43.042
Oh.

37:43.303 --> 37:45.135
Have you done the autopsy
on James Weckler?

37:46.639 --> 37:49.723
Right, the dominatrix killer.

37:49.976 --> 37:51.012
Died of asphyxiation.

37:51.227 --> 37:52.138
Pretty standard hanging.

37:52.353 --> 37:53.889
Is it possible there was
foul play?

37:54.105 --> 37:55.141
It's possible.

37:55.607 --> 37:57.189
But there'd be no way
to know for sure.

37:57.358 --> 37:59.224
Not with the evidence
I collected from the body.

37:59.652 --> 38:01.063
What about Liv?

38:01.488 --> 38:04.697
Maybe some visions
could fill in the gaps.

38:05.074 --> 38:08.283
Weckler's still here.
You could ask her really nice.

38:08.495 --> 38:09.906
Wait. How pressing is this?

38:10.121 --> 38:11.953
Not very. I don't even know
what I'm looking for.

38:12.165 --> 38:13.246
Why?

38:20.256 --> 38:23.966
Now, Weckler's brain soaks
in the blue juice for 10 days.

38:24.177 --> 38:25.884
The juice
supercharges the visions.

38:27.847 --> 38:29.213
Liv's gonna hate me.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.257
Weckler had
some mental health issues.

38:32.685 --> 38:33.926
She could always refuse.

38:42.487 --> 38:43.694
So?

38:43.905 --> 38:44.986
So?

38:45.198 --> 38:46.734
How'd it go last night
with Liv?

38:47.492 --> 38:48.699
I thought it was going good.

38:50.161 --> 38:52.824
It was weird,
I really opened up to her.

38:53.039 --> 38:55.873
But when I took her home,
she just bolted for the door.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.371
- I think she may be a racist.
- (LAUGHS)

38:58.586 --> 39:00.043
Or worse, frigid.

39:01.172 --> 39:03.960
Actually she wanted me
to pass along this note.

39:20.191 --> 39:21.727
You mind returning
this to her?

39:22.360 --> 39:23.350
Sure.

39:23.570 --> 39:24.651
But this is officially

39:24.863 --> 39:26.695
the last note I pass
between you two.

39:31.077 --> 39:32.067
Yes, sir?

39:35.373 --> 39:36.363
Understood.

39:38.293 --> 39:39.249
Yes, sir.

39:40.628 --> 39:42.085
The tracker they planted
in that gun nut's truck

39:42.297 --> 39:43.583
shows him heading
for our 20.

39:44.007 --> 39:46.715
- I'll get eyes on Baracus. You go throw down the spike strip.
- Got it.

39:52.932 --> 39:54.013
I can't see nothing.

39:58.229 --> 39:59.561
(TIRES SCREECH)

40:01.608 --> 40:02.724
What the hell?

40:03.651 --> 40:04.983
Our front tires are blown.

40:10.408 --> 40:14.027
Gentlemen, this
is a private road.

40:14.245 --> 40:15.361
What's your business here?

40:15.580 --> 40:16.821
Uh...

40:17.040 --> 40:18.201
We heard there was
a party out here.

40:23.838 --> 40:24.874
Duct tape.

40:25.465 --> 40:26.876
Blood pressure cuff.

40:27.091 --> 40:28.423
What kind of party
y'all headed to?

40:29.010 --> 40:30.000
Uh...

40:36.100 --> 40:37.762
(SHRIEKS)

40:38.269 --> 40:39.476
What the hell was that?

40:43.900 --> 40:44.890
Oh, God.

40:45.443 --> 40:46.524
You ran over that fella!

40:46.778 --> 40:47.689
Let's get out of here!

40:55.370 --> 40:56.702
Gun it! Go! Go! Go!

40:56.913 --> 40:59.155
(GROWLING)

40:59.374 --> 41:00.455
(TIRES SCREECH)

41:00.667 --> 41:02.283
- Go, go!
- I'm going, I'm going!

41:02.460 --> 41:03.792
- Faster!
- (GROWLS)

41:04.003 --> 41:05.289
I can't go any faster!

41:05.505 --> 41:06.962
(GROWLING AND PANTING)

41:12.595 --> 41:14.632
(GROWLS)

41:15.390 --> 41:16.597
(TIRES SCREECH)

41:18.267 --> 41:19.303
(GNARLS)

41:29.362 --> 41:30.944
Oh, my God, oh, my God...

41:31.155 --> 41:32.396
Did you see that?

41:38.287 --> 41:39.403
We got it.

41:40.498 --> 41:41.784
We totally got it!

41:43.209 --> 41:44.370
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

41:44.585 --> 41:46.542
<i>(GROWLS)</i>

41:47.505 --> 41:48.916
(BOTH LAUGH)

41:49.132 --> 41:50.373
Yes!

41:50.591 --> 41:51.752
They're sure as hell gonna
believe us now.

41:51.968 --> 41:53.504
- Yeah!
- Yes!

41:53.720 --> 41:54.710
(BOTH LAUGH)
