<i>Previously on Married With Children:</i>

00:04.920 --> 00:09.835
Thanks, Al. For the first time in our
marriage, you're leaving me satisfied.

00:10.040 --> 00:13.271
<i>That satisfaction, however,
was short-lived.</i>

00:13.480 --> 00:17.029
Don't worry, Mom.
We'll never leave you.

00:18.560 --> 00:22.155
<i>Meanwhile, Al reinvented himself.</i>

00:24.280 --> 00:26.714
<i>And while Peggy's luck
turned for the better...</i>

00:26.920 --> 00:31.311
- You have a big ego.
- It matches my wallet and my car.

00:31.520 --> 00:34.353
<i>...Al's luck, well...</i>

01:23.400 --> 01:25.356
Oh, Al, that's a beaut.

01:25.560 --> 01:28.074
I haven't seen a shiner that bad
since I told my wife...

01:28.280 --> 01:30.953
...she was starting to look
like Al Roker.

01:31.160 --> 01:33.515
Well, it looks like Marcy was right.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.712
She said
it was only a matter of time...

01:35.920 --> 01:38.593
...before some woman
beat the holy hell out of you.

01:39.120 --> 01:42.795
I'll have you know
I got this black eye last night...

01:43.000 --> 01:44.991
...explaining to a jealous boyfriend...

01:45.200 --> 01:48.033
...how the little lady
would rather stay with me.

01:48.960 --> 01:50.837
Well, where is she?

01:51.040 --> 01:53.349
I sent her out shopping
for a new waterbed.

01:53.560 --> 01:57.155
This one has a leak,
and I worry so when she bounces.

01:58.160 --> 02:01.994
So you just tell Marcy that
I'm doing just fine with the ladies.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.919
That Al Bundy is not only
moving in the fast lane...

02:05.120 --> 02:08.157
...he's doing wheelies in it, baby.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.636
Is that true, Al? About the girl?

02:11.840 --> 02:13.273
Every word of it.

02:13.480 --> 02:16.278
Except the guy's name was Sasquatch,
the girl left with him...

02:16.480 --> 02:19.153
...and there's an odour
coming from that bed scares even me.

02:21.680 --> 02:23.272
Are things really that bad?

02:23.480 --> 02:25.550
Yes, things are that bad.

02:25.760 --> 02:29.912
Married men can never go back to
being single. See, there's this gene...

02:30.120 --> 02:33.351
...it's called the single gene.
It's in us when we're born...

02:33.560 --> 02:37.075
...but as soon as we marry,
it mysteriously disappears.

02:37.280 --> 02:40.556
Nobody knows why,
but I suspect it's removed...

02:40.760 --> 02:45.151
...chromosome by chromosome
by our wives.

02:45.880 --> 02:48.189
And how would they go about this?

02:48.400 --> 02:52.313
Do we really know
why they own so many tweezers?

02:53.320 --> 02:55.880
So, Al,
if they don't like us being single...

02:56.080 --> 02:58.355
...why do they keep kicking us
out of the house?

02:58.560 --> 03:00.630
That's part of their cruel tricks.

03:00.840 --> 03:03.513
See, without the single gene,
we're helpless.

03:03.720 --> 03:07.793
We just wander around,
smelling of Rogaine and gin...

03:10.280 --> 03:15.559
...until finally,
we fall off our toilets and die.

03:23.200 --> 03:24.428
Well, lookie here.

03:24.640 --> 03:27.234
You know, I would have thought
grocery shopping for you...

03:27.440 --> 03:30.079
...would involve swinging from trees.

03:30.280 --> 03:32.669
I'd love to stand here
and chat with you, Marce...

03:32.880 --> 03:35.553
...but I'd think standing this close
to the fryer section...

03:35.760 --> 03:37.910
...would make you a little nervous.

03:38.120 --> 03:40.031
So I guess I'll just mosey along.

03:40.240 --> 03:42.276
Fine. I was gonna
talk to you about Peggy...

03:42.480 --> 03:44.630
...but you wouldn't
be interested anymore.

03:44.840 --> 03:47.308
- Peg? Is Peg here?
- No.

03:47.520 --> 03:50.239
She's getting her hair done
for a little dinner party...

03:50.440 --> 03:51.839
...that she's throwing tonight.

03:52.040 --> 03:55.191
- Oh, Peg is throwing a dinner party.
- That's right.

03:55.400 --> 03:59.234
She has a date
with a wealthy, gorgeous man.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.476
She asked me
to pick out a nice wine for us.

04:01.680 --> 04:05.150
Oh, excuse me.
Do you have a hearty Bordeaux?

04:05.360 --> 04:09.876
Wine is aisle four.
Just step over Mrs. Bradley.

04:10.080 --> 04:13.868
Oh, excuse me. I'm spending
the evening with a supermodel...

04:14.080 --> 04:17.959
...and are these
all the condoms you have?

04:23.120 --> 04:24.394
Of course not.

04:24.600 --> 04:28.673
I have more in back,
right next to the reality pills.

04:28.880 --> 04:29.869
Let me get them.

04:31.520 --> 04:34.637
Well, Al,
have fun with your supermodel.

04:34.840 --> 04:37.673
Try not to get any paper cuts.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.152
Okay, bullet head.
We both know what's going on here.

04:43.360 --> 04:45.669
I don't have a date tonight,
and Bonbon Betsy...

04:45.880 --> 04:47.438
...isn't giving any dinner party.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.672
Right, Al.

04:50.680 --> 04:53.399
Yeah, the truth is,
is that Peggy was hoping...

04:53.600 --> 04:55.397
...that you could come
to dinner tonight.

04:55.600 --> 04:58.239
I tried to talk her out of it,
but you know how stubborn-

04:58.440 --> 05:00.431
How about I get there around 6?
Is that okay?

05:01.160 --> 05:04.277
Perfect. See you at 6.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.356
" Ribbed for her pleasure. "

05:13.920 --> 05:15.990
They're never happy.

05:22.680 --> 05:26.195
Hey, this isn't even warm.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.433
- Well, we'll help you out.
- Yeah.

05:28.640 --> 05:31.154
After all, we wanna make
a good impression on Stepdaddy.

05:31.360 --> 05:33.351
- That's right.
- Which you are...

05:33.560 --> 05:38.076
...since you are currently in Brazil,
saving the rainforest.

05:38.280 --> 05:41.670
We are? I hope we meet Sting.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.560
Mom, why don't you want us
to meet this guy?

05:45.760 --> 05:48.638
Same reason you never wanna bring
your dates home to meet me.

05:48.840 --> 05:53.038
Stepdaddy's a lazy,
bonbon-swilling Opraholic?

05:53.560 --> 05:57.838
Do you know how difficult it is for
a single working mom to meet a man?

05:58.400 --> 06:01.039
Wait a minute. Let's see.
You don't work...

06:01.240 --> 06:03.276
...and technically, you're not single.

06:03.480 --> 06:06.472
And you've never really
been much of a mom.

06:07.440 --> 06:08.839
Bud, how could you say that?

06:09.040 --> 06:12.999
She raised two kids who are
about to save the rainforest. Hello?

06:15.920 --> 06:17.478
<i>Let me put it this way:</i>

06:17.680 --> 06:21.309
Either you get out of here, or I'm gonna
send you to live with your father.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.550
So would anyone
like some more potato salad?

06:28.080 --> 06:29.069
No, no.

06:32.800 --> 06:36.713
Well, I hope
you're all enjoying your meal.

06:37.560 --> 06:41.235
I've been enjoying this bite
for half an hour.

06:41.760 --> 06:46.276
What is this delightful
crunchy coating?

06:46.480 --> 06:49.278
Well, that's rust from the pan.

06:51.480 --> 06:54.438
You know,
iron is really good for you.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.312
I hope you saved room for dessert.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.389
Oh, God.
I wonder what dessert's gonna be.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.591
Phlegm brulÃ©e?

07:13.840 --> 07:14.875
I'll go find out.

07:15.080 --> 07:20.313
Bruce, why don't you tell Jefferson
about those car dealerships you own?

07:20.520 --> 07:23.273
Suck up to him, honey.
It could mean a job.

07:25.280 --> 07:27.396
Have you heard
about the new Korean car?

07:27.600 --> 07:30.717
It's got a Sun Myung Moon roof.

07:32.240 --> 07:35.755
Rich and funny. God, I'm a catch.

07:39.320 --> 07:40.469
Oh, he's wonderful, Peggy.

07:40.680 --> 07:43.592
He reminds me of Jefferson,
except with his own credit cards.

07:45.440 --> 07:50.798
- I know. You know, he is perfect, but I-
- If you don't want him, I'll take him.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.117
- Well, what about Jefferson?
- Who's Jefferson?

07:56.520 --> 07:58.750
Are you all right?

07:59.440 --> 08:03.718
All right, all right, here we go.
Up, up. Come on, up.

08:20.680 --> 08:23.717
Jefferson must really want a job.

08:33.840 --> 08:37.150
If you didn't like it, you could have
just spit it up into your napkin.

08:37.360 --> 08:38.873
No, no, no, that was wonderful...

08:39.080 --> 08:42.595
...it's just that I hate to see you
slaving away in the kitchen.

08:42.799 --> 08:44.677
From now on, we eat out.

08:45.800 --> 08:48.439
Can we go to one of those
fancy French places?

08:48.640 --> 08:52.713
Well, my darling,
if this year-end Yugo-palooza sale...

08:52.920 --> 08:56.390
...goes as well as I expect,
I'll be taking you to dine in Paris.

08:56.600 --> 08:59.034
Ever made love in the Eiffel Tower?

08:59.240 --> 09:03.791
Well, no, but once I frenched a guy
in the Sears Tower.

09:22.280 --> 09:25.477
Al. Well, what are you doing here?

09:25.680 --> 09:27.636
I invited him.

09:27.840 --> 09:31.879
Al, I'd like you to meet
Peggy's new boyfriend...

09:33.840 --> 09:35.671
...Bruce.

09:39.760 --> 09:42.832
Look, Jefferson,
we have our Christmas card.

09:45.200 --> 09:49.512
Gee, Peg,
you really have a new boyfriend.

09:50.960 --> 09:53.110
Well, this is an awkward moment.

09:53.320 --> 09:56.995
Fortunately, I'm so self-centred
it's not gonna bother me.

09:57.840 --> 09:59.398
Well, me either.

10:01.800 --> 10:05.236
The only reason I accepted
Marcy's invitation was an excuse...

10:05.440 --> 10:07.431
...to see my dog.

10:08.720 --> 10:11.359
Hey there, fella.
How you doing there?

10:11.560 --> 10:15.997
Hey, I brought you
some bonbon biscuits here.

10:16.200 --> 10:19.476
You can't imagine
how I miss this guy.

10:19.680 --> 10:21.955
Didn't he used to be bigger?

10:23.480 --> 10:24.435
That was Buck.

10:25.880 --> 10:27.871
Well, goodbye, all. I gotta be going.

10:28.080 --> 10:31.277
Frankly, coming back to this house
is giving me the willy-squidgets.

10:32.080 --> 10:37.757
Oh, well, let me show you out.
This is the happiest day of my life.

10:37.960 --> 10:40.520
Hey, no problem.

10:40.720 --> 10:42.073
Well, that went well.

10:42.280 --> 10:44.635
Here's some flowers for you.

10:52.400 --> 10:55.710
I can't believe
we finally get to meet Stepdaddy.

10:55.920 --> 10:59.754
Now, remember, he's gonna be trying
to buy our affection.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.918
So to really rake it in,
I suggest we play hard to get.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.678
Play what?

11:08.600 --> 11:10.431
Hard to get.

11:14.960 --> 11:18.032
It's like when you have a date
and you decide to wear a bra.

11:18.240 --> 11:21.038
- Oh, right. Okay, baby, I got it.
- Yeah. There you go.

11:22.120 --> 11:25.192
Kids, Bruce will be here any minute.

11:25.400 --> 11:29.234
<i>Now, remember:
Put your best foot forward.</i>

11:32.800 --> 11:35.951
What's she talking about?
They look exactly the same.

11:37.200 --> 11:41.671
<i>- That's him. He's here.
- Now, remember: hard to get.</i>

11:45.120 --> 11:46.075
- Hi. I'm Bruce-
- Hi.

11:46.280 --> 11:48.714
We love you, Stepdaddy.

11:49.520 --> 11:52.796
Kelly, Kelly.
That's not playing hard to get.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.956
It is for me.

11:56.120 --> 11:57.155
Nice to meet you.

11:57.360 --> 12:00.796
Yeah, I thought you two would be
in Brazil, saving the rainforest.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.913
Oh, well, we had to come back
because we forgot our umbrellas.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.190
It was, like, raining,
you know what I mean?

12:07.400 --> 12:09.197
Actually, we live here.

12:09.400 --> 12:12.233
You ought to know that Kelly and I
are extremely protective...

12:12.440 --> 12:15.273
...of our dear mother.
We want only the best for her.

12:15.480 --> 12:16.469
Oh, me too.

12:16.680 --> 12:19.990
That's why I've been thinking
that maybe you two should be leaving...

12:20.200 --> 12:22.395
...this split-level Porta-Potty...

12:22.600 --> 12:25.273
...and taking responsibility
for your own lives.

12:32.040 --> 12:34.838
He's a wicked stepdaddy.

12:35.920 --> 12:38.753
Kelly, hug him hard, and don't let go
until you got his wallet.

12:43.360 --> 12:48.639
Well, I see you've met my daughter.
Are we still dating?

12:48.840 --> 12:52.674
Yes, of course. Yes.

12:52.880 --> 12:55.474
<i>But this would make
a great Penthouse letter.</i>

12:59.080 --> 13:00.433
- You have to dump him.
- Yeah.

13:00.640 --> 13:05.919
- He's a bad man. He's a very bad man.
- He doesn't like us.

13:06.120 --> 13:08.475
Yeah, but most people don't.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.275
Have you ever thought
that it might be you?

13:12.400 --> 13:15.198
Mom, he's trying
to take you away from us.

13:15.400 --> 13:18.392
I know that,
and don't you try to stop him.

13:19.400 --> 13:20.879
All right, all right.

13:21.080 --> 13:25.631
We didn't wanna have
to tell you this, but he's a woman.

13:27.520 --> 13:30.671
And he touched me.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.957
You wish.

13:39.720 --> 13:42.393
Now, look,
I know that Bruce isn't perfect...

13:42.600 --> 13:45.956
...and he doesn't have
your father's animal magnetism...

13:46.160 --> 13:50.870
...or his animal scent
or his hairy knuckles...

13:51.080 --> 13:53.150
...but what he does have is money.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.874
Enough to turn me
into a lady of leisure.

13:56.080 --> 13:59.993
Mom, if you were any more leisurely,
you'd be unconscious.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.508
Yes, but I'd be unconscious
on a suede couch...

14:03.720 --> 14:05.233
<i>...with a big-screen TV...</i>

14:05.440 --> 14:08.876
...and a maid serving me bonbons,
right, Bruce?

14:12.520 --> 14:16.035
I get it now. He's just using Mom
to get his green card.

14:17.840 --> 14:20.354
Should you do me the honour
of becoming Mrs. Right...

14:20.560 --> 14:23.074
...I'm sure you'll wanna learn
how to cook and clean.

14:23.280 --> 14:26.158
Why can't I have a maid? You're rich.

14:26.360 --> 14:28.874
And I plan to stay that way.

14:29.560 --> 14:33.109
I certainly
don't wanna end up like this.

14:35.080 --> 14:37.640
What about eating out
all around the world?

14:37.840 --> 14:40.912
Oh, we can do that
while we're courting.

14:41.120 --> 14:43.156
But as we say in the car business...

14:43.360 --> 14:46.989
...you don't have to kiss ass
once you close the deal.

14:48.440 --> 14:52.319
And just what makes you think
that I wanna close the deal?

14:52.520 --> 14:54.590
I just assumed that.

14:54.800 --> 14:57.030
I mean, a top-of-the-line model
like myself...

14:57.240 --> 15:00.391
...doesn't stay long
on the showroom floor.

15:00.600 --> 15:04.354
And although
you are very attractive...

15:04.560 --> 15:06.755
...we can't turn your odometer back.

15:09.080 --> 15:12.675
Excuse me, but nobody talks
to my mother like that.

15:12.880 --> 15:15.474
Oh, yeah? What are you
gonna do about it, junior?

15:16.240 --> 15:17.832
Kelly?

15:32.400 --> 15:34.595
If you're in the market
for a used car, call me.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.756
Get out of here.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.870
You know what Dad would do
if he was here now?

15:44.080 --> 15:45.593
He'd lead us in a "Whoa Bundy. "

15:46.120 --> 15:51.114
Yeah, but he's not here,
so it's a " No Bundy. "

15:53.560 --> 15:56.074
What are you saying, Mom?
You miss Dad?

15:56.280 --> 15:59.795
More than words can say.

17:01.240 --> 17:02.559
I told you.

17:02.760 --> 17:07.753
Technically, my rent is not due
until after the 15th of the- Hi, Peg.

17:07.960 --> 17:11.589
- Hi, Al. Can I come in?
- In here?

17:11.800 --> 17:15.634
Oh, yeah. Just a minute, Peg.
Excuse me.

17:34.400 --> 17:35.515
Come in.

17:35.720 --> 17:41.590
Sorry the place is a little bit
of a mess here, but, well...

17:41.800 --> 17:44.155
...I live here.

17:44.960 --> 17:49.715
Oh, that's okay.
You know, I just came over...

17:50.800 --> 17:52.438
...to talk about the kids.

17:53.520 --> 17:55.875
Yeah. Sorry, Peg,
I'd take the kids off your hands...

17:56.080 --> 17:59.117
...but the manager here
says that he won't allow pets or kids...

17:59.320 --> 18:03.313
...and Bud and Kelly
fall in there somewhere.

18:04.320 --> 18:06.959
Oh, it's not that. It's just that-

18:08.280 --> 18:10.589
Well, you know,
I'm worried about Bud.

18:10.800 --> 18:14.395
He's been getting into fights lately, and
I thought you should know about that.

18:14.600 --> 18:18.115
Well, I certainly should.
I am still the boy's father...

18:18.320 --> 18:22.996
...and if he's getting in fights,
I should be there to congratulate him.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.077
I'll stop over
tomorrow right after work.

18:26.680 --> 18:28.432
Okay.

18:29.040 --> 18:32.271
So how is work?

18:32.480 --> 18:36.439
Oh, you know, can't complain.

18:36.640 --> 18:38.596
Well, you could try.

18:38.800 --> 18:41.712
You know, the kids and I
kind of miss your little shoe stories.

18:43.440 --> 18:48.309
Well, there was this woman
who came in the store today...

18:48.520 --> 18:50.875
...tried on every black high heel
we had in stock...

18:51.080 --> 18:53.275
...and then told us
she was just browsing.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.550
So just as she was leaving...

18:55.760 --> 18:58.797
...someone plugged her right in the ass
with a 7 EEE clog.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.638
Don't know who.

19:02.840 --> 19:07.118
Someone who could rifle a football
40 yards downfield, I'll bet.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.390
Could be.

19:13.880 --> 19:16.314
So how are things with you, Peg?

19:16.520 --> 19:21.150
Oh, pretty good.
Marcy sends her hate.

19:22.040 --> 19:26.750
Marcy. An amazing amount of spunk
for a stick figure.

19:28.400 --> 19:32.075
You know what, Al?
I brought you something.

19:32.280 --> 19:36.751
See? It has your name
right on the label.

19:36.960 --> 19:39.190
"A. Bundy. "

19:39.400 --> 19:42.631
<i>You bought me my own TV Guide.</i>

19:42.840 --> 19:45.832
Well, you know,
we have been married for 25 years.

19:46.040 --> 19:50.238
Since you were 18 and I was 9.

19:50.920 --> 19:56.472
Yeah. Boy, we had
some good times, didn't we, Peg?

19:58.160 --> 19:59.718
Didn't we?

20:01.560 --> 20:06.509
Gee, I haven't
given it much thought. Probably.

20:08.320 --> 20:11.471
Well, I guess I better be going.

20:11.680 --> 20:14.274
Oh, what am I thinking?
I don't have a ride.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.198
Kelly and her date dropped me off.

20:16.400 --> 20:20.393
Oh, well,
I suppose I could give you a ride.

20:20.600 --> 20:24.798
- If it wouldn't be too much trouble.
- No, no trouble.

20:25.760 --> 20:27.796
Well, Peg, here we are.

20:28.640 --> 20:32.394
- Here we are where?
- Come on, Peg.

20:32.600 --> 20:38.357
Don't you remember Maple Lane?
And the maple tree on Maple Lane?

20:38.560 --> 20:43.918
Oh, Al. This is where we parked
the very first time we-

20:44.120 --> 20:46.031
Yep.

20:46.240 --> 20:48.834
The first time we ever had a fight.

20:49.520 --> 20:53.877
I don't remember much about the fight,
but I sure do remember making up.

20:55.360 --> 20:56.509
Oh, Al.

20:56.720 --> 21:01.475
Since this was our biggest fight ever,
will we have our biggest makeup ever?

21:02.000 --> 21:04.150
You got that right, babe.

21:04.360 --> 21:08.751
Just like this car, we're built to last.
