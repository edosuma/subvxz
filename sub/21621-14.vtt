WEBVTT

00:14.481 --> 00:18.785
I'mma be honest with you. I've seen
some of the other Carpool Karaoke's.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.287
We're about to change the game.

00:20.354 --> 00:24.124
'Cause we're about to outdo everybody.
Our s*** is gonna be crazy.

00:24.191 --> 00:27.861
Dude, 49 of my 50 videos
have been inside of a car

00:27.928 --> 00:31.565
while I was rapping and driving
at the same time.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.233
"49 out of 50."

00:33.300 --> 00:38.872
Do you know I have the perfect theme song
anytime somebody is in a Cadillac, right?

00:41.208 --> 00:42.910
-Oh yeah.
-I can't do that one.

00:42.976 --> 00:44.678
I need you to do this right now, man.

00:44.745 --> 00:45.879
I'm not rapping this song.

00:45.946 --> 00:50.117
What do you mean, dude?
You're Black Ty, don't act shy now.

00:50.184 --> 00:52.286
Let's do another song.

00:52.352 --> 00:56.490
Rese, there is no other song. We're in
a Cadillac, we have to do this song.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.692
C'mon, man. Stop acting shy, dawg.

02:00.787 --> 02:04.091
Pretty damn good rapping
for someone who didn't wanna rap.

02:04.157 --> 02:09.329
I try to get it right. I never asked you,
when did you start rapping?

02:09.395 --> 02:13.600
I made my first song when I was nine years
old. I don't even think you know that.

02:13.667 --> 02:16.803
And we've known each other
for like fifteen years.

02:16.870 --> 02:21.575
First song when I was nine, but I had to
lie 'cause I didn't have my raps together.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.778
I lied and said I was ten 'cause I wanted
to rhyme with "girlfriend".

02:24.845 --> 02:27.347
So, my first song I ever did
was called:

02:34.388 --> 02:39.193
First song I ever wrote.  The question is,
Black Ty, when did you start rapping?

02:39.259 --> 02:44.631
Long before I ever knew I could sing.
I was in a group called Triple Impact.

02:44.698 --> 02:47.568
What? Where's the other two homies?

02:47.634 --> 02:49.102
Here's the thing.

02:49.169 --> 02:52.806
It was so long ago I don't even remember
what my hip-hop name was.

02:56.276 --> 02:58.712
Oh my god.

03:00.280 --> 03:01.215
Hey!

03:03.283 --> 03:04.251
Hey.

03:18.131 --> 03:20.267
-Stop right here.
-Oh!

03:21.802 --> 03:24.905
-Oh! Oh!
-Oh! Oh!

03:24.972 --> 03:26.807
Hey! Hey!

03:30.244 --> 03:33.547
Oh, oh!

03:36.517 --> 03:38.819
Oh yeah! Hey!

03:38.886 --> 03:40.687
-C'mon now.
-What we do at a traffic light.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.092
-Oh, hey.
-Oh.

03:47.261 --> 03:48.095
Oh!

03:51.765 --> 03:55.002
-Hey. Come on.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.054
-Hey, my guy.
-Yo.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.857
Come here real quick. You know this song.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.793
-For real?
-Yeah, hurry up.

04:24.731 --> 04:25.566
There you go.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.415
Hey, hey, hey.

04:54.828 --> 04:59.099
So look, man. We do these
The Fast and the Furious films.

04:59.166 --> 05:03.303
In every interview we do,
they always ask:

05:03.370 --> 05:05.739
-"Who's the best driver in the crew?"
-They are.

05:05.806 --> 05:09.576
You always say you the best.
I know I'm the best.

05:09.643 --> 05:13.046
So, we're gonna put this thing to rest.
Once and for all.

05:13.113 --> 05:15.516
And we're gonna get to the bottom
of who's the best driver.

05:15.582 --> 05:18.752
Let's find out who's the best driver.
I can't wait for this.

05:27.361 --> 05:30.063
Come on, jump in, man.
Nice to meet you, man.

05:30.097 --> 05:31.932
-What up?
-How are you doing? Ready?

05:32.065 --> 05:34.067
Yes, sir. I was born ready, he wasn't.

05:34.134 --> 05:39.740
I got this. Hands at ten and two o'clock.
I know how to pass a driving test.

05:40.474 --> 05:44.745
Hold on, let me put my seatbelt on
with this dude behind the wheel.

05:44.811 --> 05:46.680
Everything's gonna be just fine.

05:46.747 --> 05:48.148
Oh no, it's not.

05:48.215 --> 05:51.585
-Are you ready for this?
-Yup, when does the time start?

05:51.652 --> 05:52.486
Now.

05:55.088 --> 05:56.290
Yep.

05:56.356 --> 06:01.562
We're gonna go right through the deer
right here to the right-hand side.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.797
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

06:03.864 --> 06:06.934
Hey, be careful. Hey, stop! Hey!

06:07.034 --> 06:10.938
Watch out bro, oh!
Fast &amp; Furious is a film, bro!

06:11.038 --> 06:14.208
It's not real life. It ain't real life.
Hold on, wait!

06:15.042 --> 06:17.711
We're gonna go around the grandma
right here to the right.

06:17.778 --> 06:20.080
-Not over there? Oh, man.
-No, not over there.

06:20.147 --> 06:22.749
-Come on now. Goddammit.
-That's right.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.418
Wait, wait, wait!

06:24.484 --> 06:28.288
I don't know. You got an extra seatbelt?
You should put more seatbelts on.

06:28.355 --> 06:31.925
-You're hittin' stuff, bro.
-I'm not hittin' s***.

06:32.626 --> 06:37.231
And you're gonna park between the glasses,
Vin Diesel, and The Rock.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.969
Perfect, good job.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.606
Cris, Cris!

06:45.939 --> 06:49.243
-Are you gonna run me over?
-Hold on, guys!

06:50.077 --> 06:51.245
I've got it.

06:51.311 --> 06:53.614
Make sure you check that blind spot.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.084
Bam.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.355
There's a little parallel parking, guys.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.225
Congratulations.

07:05.292 --> 07:07.094
Keep your g****** certificate.

07:09.029 --> 07:12.232
I think we settled once and for all
who the better driver is.

07:12.299 --> 07:15.836
Your driving is boring. If you were to do
that in The Fast and the Furious,

07:15.903 --> 07:18.639
you probably wouldn't have made it
past Fast two.

07:18.705 --> 07:22.809
Just admit I'm the better driver, man.
How difficult is that for you?

07:22.876 --> 07:26.580
It's about time for you to do
your thizzle now, though.

07:26.647 --> 07:31.218
What the hell is this?
Come on, I can't sing. You know that.

07:31.285 --> 07:35.556
Come on, baby. Try to get it right,
I'm listening to every note.

07:35.622 --> 07:39.059
-Don't make me do this.
-Come on, bro.

07:39.126 --> 07:42.629
Don't make me do this, man.
Rappers don't sing. You understand?

07:45.866 --> 07:50.971
There it is. Would you be.

07:51.071 --> 07:54.441
-I can do the ad-libs. My lifetime.

07:54.508 --> 07:58.378
-You know I'll be there. When you need me.

08:01.748 --> 08:03.617
I can do that. Hold up.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.329
You didn't know I could do that, boy!
Watch this.

08:26.340 --> 08:30.811
Oh no, man. I'm all off. I got
pitch issues. I'll tell you what--

08:30.878 --> 08:34.914
I've never heard so many "heys"
in one g****** record.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.669
Good s***, bro.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.077
Tell me about some pick-up lines, man.

09:04.144 --> 09:08.849
Back in the day we had our time.
We were pimping all over the world.

09:08.916 --> 09:11.552
Oh my God. One of my favorites...

09:11.618 --> 09:16.256
When you see a woman that's drop dead
beautiful, and you say to her:

09:16.323 --> 09:20.394
"It must be incredible waking up
to yourself every morning."

09:20.460 --> 09:22.396
Okay. That's a nice pick-up line.

09:22.462 --> 09:24.665
That thing right there.

09:24.731 --> 09:28.435
I got one that's even better, though.
Because weâ€™ve traveled the world.

09:28.502 --> 09:32.639
A lot of times we visit places and meet
women that don't speak the same language.

09:32.706 --> 09:35.709
So you might ask if they speak English,
and they don't.

09:35.776 --> 09:39.379
And you be like,
"No? Well, do you speak Dinglish?"

09:43.884 --> 09:48.755
Which is an international language.

09:48.822 --> 09:51.792
I've met many women
that didn't speak English,

09:51.859 --> 09:55.062
but they all spoke Dinglish.

11:17.611 --> 11:20.414
Anybody who really sings
and knows how to do it...

11:20.480 --> 11:22.950
There had to have been
a point in your life

11:23.083 --> 11:27.254
where you realised that you could sing
and hit notes unlike other people.

11:27.321 --> 11:30.991
First of all, I used to sing in the
bathroom like everybody else...

11:31.091 --> 11:32.793
Everybody can sing in the bathroom.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.862
-Right, 'cause of the reverb.
-Reverb!

11:34.928 --> 11:38.332
But the problem is,
we only had one bathroom in our house.

11:38.398 --> 11:43.203
So, if somebody had to go to the
bathroom, then you had to go back

11:43.270 --> 11:46.473
and sit through that experience,
which was a s***** situation.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.442
One hundred percent.

11:49.543 --> 11:53.146
I had to be 13, 14 years old.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.883
My neighbour came out,
who had heard me sing,

11:55.949 --> 11:59.186
and she told all of her cousins
and friends to come around,

11:59.253 --> 12:01.955
and it was like seven people
in the middle of the street.

12:02.055 --> 12:05.959
Once I started singing, they
all started screaming and going crazy.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.896
That's when I decided to be a singer.

12:08.962 --> 12:11.765
The reason and the moment
you decided to be a singer

12:11.832 --> 12:15.702
is similar to the same way I said I made
that song when I was nine or ten,

12:15.769 --> 12:18.772
but when I let my friends
around the neighbourhood hear it,

12:18.839 --> 12:23.177
they kept egging me on,
and every day they said, "Spit a new rap."

12:23.243 --> 12:25.879
That's the moment that I decided
I might have something,

12:25.946 --> 12:29.616
because my entire neighbourhood wanted to
hear me do music, man.

12:29.683 --> 12:32.953
We never discussed that.  We've got
more in common than you know, man.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.860
I just need your forgiveness, baby.

12:41.895 --> 12:44.331
Can you give me
your mercy too, please?

12:46.567 --> 12:48.635
I know I'm crazy.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.539
What have I done to you? What?

12:54.675 --> 12:57.744
I'm sorry, babe. I'm sorry.

12:58.912 --> 13:01.515
I said I'm sorry, baby.

13:03.784 --> 13:08.322
I'm ashamed, ok? G******!
I'm admitting it out loud.

13:11.158 --> 13:14.561
I'm sorry for doing what I did.
I didn't mean to do that.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.676
Everything alright, Cris?

13:29.743 --> 13:35.082
This is now a confessional booth.
Is there something you'd like to say?

13:35.115 --> 13:38.752
-I'm ashamed of me.
-"I'm ashamed of me."

13:38.819 --> 13:43.357
It's alright. You're gonna be ok, man.
Nothing but love.

13:43.991 --> 13:47.094
There's some tissues
in the glove compartment.

13:53.567 --> 13:57.271
We are here at the
Universal Studios Hollywood.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.873
You mean,
Ludaversal Studios Hollywood.

13:59.940 --> 14:04.912
We can go with that. We happen to have
our own theme park ride.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.813
Fast &amp; Furious: Supercharged.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.549
We're gonna surprise the viewers.

14:08.615 --> 14:13.587
I'm always down for surprising people,
especially when it's unexpected.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.753
What's up? What's going on?

14:50.290 --> 14:51.325
Surprise.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.126
Tyrese and Ludacris.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.728
Hey, everybody!

14:54.795 --> 14:56.096
How's it going, guys?

14:56.163 --> 14:58.165
Let us on.

14:59.399 --> 15:03.036
What's going on, ladies and gentlemen?

15:03.070 --> 15:06.707
I'm sure nobody expected this,
but we love you so much

15:06.773 --> 15:09.510
that we decided to show up
and say "what's up?" in person.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.545
What's up, everybody?

15:12.713 --> 15:16.183
Nobody has ever done this
on Carpool Karaoke before,

15:16.250 --> 15:18.852
and we want to make history.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.055
What are you talking about?

15:22.089 --> 15:26.493
I wanna sing a song, and I need everybody
to sing along and participate with me.

15:26.560 --> 15:31.064
It goes a little something like this.
Let's see if you guys know how it goes.

15:31.131 --> 15:34.735
Now, if you don't have no rhythm,
I'm gonna pray for you.

15:37.871 --> 15:39.373
Turn up!

15:39.439 --> 15:41.375
Here we go!

15:45.712 --> 15:48.715
Put your hands up!

15:48.782 --> 15:51.518
Hey! Hey!

15:51.585 --> 15:54.121
Up! Up!

15:54.188 --> 15:58.325
â™ª 'Cause all I do is win win win â™ª

15:59.092 --> 16:03.830
Tyrese, I think we just won
Carpool Karaoke for years to come.
