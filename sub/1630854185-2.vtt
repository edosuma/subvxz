00:08.486 --> 00:10.575
<i>Previously on</i> CSI: Vegas...

00:10.619 --> 00:12.838
Why do you want
to come back to CSI?I got kicked off the board.

00:12.882 --> 00:15.015
- Of the Eclipse?
- Mm-hmm.

00:15.058 --> 00:16.494
Beau Finado.
You can call me Beau.

00:16.538 --> 00:18.670
Or Finado.
Or Beau Finado.

00:18.714 --> 00:20.368
<i>He ran R and D
for a few different</i>

00:20.411 --> 00:22.500
<i>Fortune 500 chemical companies.</i>

00:22.544 --> 00:24.067
Al, you're here.

00:24.111 --> 00:25.068
You said you needed me.

00:25.112 --> 00:26.156
Got a real mess here.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.375
Is this Allie?

00:27.418 --> 00:29.855
- Sure is.
- Hi, I'm Serena Chavez.

00:29.899 --> 00:31.379
<i>Josh, we've talked
a dozen times since then.</i>

00:31.422 --> 00:32.380
<i>Yeah, I should've mentioned it.</i>

00:32.423 --> 00:33.642
It was casual and then--

00:33.685 --> 00:35.165
But it's more now,
is it?

00:35.209 --> 00:36.688
- Something brought you back.
- Grace Huang.

00:36.732 --> 00:38.690
<i>Grace has been missing
for three weeks.</i>

00:38.734 --> 00:40.344
Nobody at the Eclipse

00:40.388 --> 00:42.172
<i>even seemed to care.</i>

00:42.216 --> 00:45.045
<i>I really have no idea
what they're covering up.</i>

00:51.834 --> 00:54.141
Oh, no!

00:54.184 --> 00:56.230
No, please.

00:58.275 --> 01:00.321
No, no!

01:00.364 --> 01:02.366
I'm begging you!

01:04.194 --> 01:06.283
Weak. So weak.

01:09.721 --> 01:11.462
This place sucks.

01:11.506 --> 01:14.161
- I want a refund.
- Seriously.

01:14.204 --> 01:16.511
You won't be saying
that in the end.

01:19.905 --> 01:22.778
ANNOUNCER [over speaker]:
Necropolis is now closed.

01:22.821 --> 01:24.910
Las Vegas's scariest
year-round haunt

01:24.954 --> 01:27.304
reopens tomorrow night
at 8:00 p.m.

01:27.348 --> 01:30.916
See you then... if you dare.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.875
: They should
just pay that guy

01:32.918 --> 01:34.572
to stand there
with the lights on.

01:36.661 --> 01:38.576
Forget it, man.
They're just kids.

01:42.624 --> 01:44.539
Oh, God.

01:44.582 --> 01:46.106
What is that smell?

01:46.149 --> 01:48.238
I think it's coming
from the mannequin.

01:48.282 --> 01:51.067
Oh, God, there's
a body in there!

01:56.159 --> 01:58.683
Hey, don't leave me!

01:58.727 --> 02:01.295
Guys!

02:05.212 --> 02:06.865
Help!

02:09.694 --> 02:11.957
Got some weird
metallic blue powder here.

02:12.001 --> 02:14.438
Need collection tape.
Collection tape...

02:14.482 --> 02:16.919
Collection tape.
Collection tape.

02:16.962 --> 02:18.312
Where the hell
- is the collection tape?
- Beau...

02:18.355 --> 02:20.488
What?
It's in your
pocket there.

02:21.750 --> 02:22.925
There you go.
Honestly, it amazes me,

02:22.968 --> 02:24.883
how many people
love gore.

02:24.927 --> 02:27.538
Yeah, those in glass houses,
though, right?

02:27.582 --> 02:29.061
So this mannequin,

02:29.105 --> 02:30.933
none of the employees
remember where they got it.

02:30.976 --> 02:32.891
Can't find
a purchase order.

02:32.935 --> 02:35.329
I guess he just
sort of showed up.

02:35.372 --> 02:37.374
Got about
- a zillion cameras.
- Yeah, we'll check,

02:37.418 --> 02:38.897
but the footage gets
erased every month.

02:38.941 --> 02:40.247
I hear the guy's been around
longer than that.

02:40.290 --> 02:41.639
Why do this to a body?

02:41.683 --> 02:44.164
Who did this?
That's the question.

02:44.207 --> 02:45.643
You're point on this.

02:45.687 --> 02:47.689
You know, my parents
almost named me Stew?

02:49.038 --> 02:51.780
Oh, sorry, I just...

02:51.823 --> 02:54.130
never even heard of a body
being this viscous.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.436
The seal must've been airtight.

02:55.479 --> 02:57.002
Any idea what this shell
is made of?

02:57.046 --> 02:58.308
It's hardened paint, I think.

02:58.352 --> 03:00.658
FTIR can tell us what kind.

03:00.702 --> 03:02.007
Holds a print really well.

03:04.662 --> 03:07.622
Look, someone loved
what they did.

03:12.670 --> 03:14.106
PIT BOSS [over radio]:
This is Porter in roulette.

03:14.150 --> 03:16.500
I've got a bogey
on the No-Fly list at Table 3.

03:16.544 --> 03:18.763
Show me.

03:20.287 --> 03:22.463
I need all floorhands
to Table 3.

03:23.681 --> 03:24.987
Nearing Table 3.

03:25.030 --> 03:26.162
I see her.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.874
You know you're not supposed
to be here, Ms. Willows.

03:42.918 --> 03:44.702
I'm sorry, Frank.
I missed you.

03:45.964 --> 03:47.401
Hey, I need a favor.

03:47.444 --> 03:49.446
There's some security footage
I need a look at.

03:50.665 --> 03:52.101
She's gonna be a problem.

03:52.144 --> 03:53.668
I need Mr. Alonso
down here.

03:53.711 --> 03:55.017
Copy that.

03:58.063 --> 03:59.891
Fellas, if this is
gonna take all day,

03:59.935 --> 04:01.937
could I at least get
a club soda?

04:15.385 --> 04:17.518
All the phone calls
weren't enough.

04:17.561 --> 04:19.520
You're harassing us
in person now.

04:19.563 --> 04:21.435
Just not gonna let this
cocktail waitress thing drop.

04:21.478 --> 04:22.871
My friend went missing.

04:22.914 --> 04:24.438
I'm sorry to be
such a stickler about it.

04:24.481 --> 04:26.440
We've got 2,000 employees, Catherine.

04:26.483 --> 04:28.180
One of them stops

04:28.224 --> 04:29.660
showing up for work,
and suddenly you're implying...

04:29.704 --> 04:31.183
Oh, no, I wasn't
implying anything.

04:31.227 --> 04:33.011
What-what is it that
you think happened?

04:33.055 --> 04:34.752
She thinks

04:34.796 --> 04:37.886
someone on our board
sold this woman to a Sultan.

04:37.929 --> 04:39.322
Or something.

04:39.366 --> 04:40.497
There's no specific
accusation, no evidence...

04:40.541 --> 04:42.238
- This is pathetic!
- I'm pathetic?

04:42.282 --> 04:43.848
You don't need this.
I've got it.

04:43.892 --> 04:46.286
Come on.
We're leaving.

04:47.852 --> 04:50.202
Jodi, I can't believe
you of all people

04:50.246 --> 04:53.597
would cast your lot
- with that scumbag.
- Please.

04:53.641 --> 04:55.817
Alonso might speak
for the board,

04:55.860 --> 04:57.949
but he doesn't
speak for me.

04:57.993 --> 05:00.300
I voted against his
motion to remove you.

05:00.343 --> 05:01.953
And now you're
physically removing me

05:01.997 --> 05:03.520
from the casino
my father built.

05:03.564 --> 05:05.392
It's just
so we can talk.

05:05.435 --> 05:07.176
I don't know

05:07.219 --> 05:09.787
what you think
happened to this girl,

05:09.831 --> 05:11.963
but I want to help.

05:17.142 --> 05:18.535
CARTER [laughing]:
Oh, man.

05:18.579 --> 05:20.537
In the ten years
since we've been open,

05:20.581 --> 05:23.148
we have never had
a crowd this big.

05:23.192 --> 05:25.890
You do realize that's
a real dead body, right?

05:25.934 --> 05:28.763
I know.
It's amazing.

05:28.806 --> 05:32.375
I mean, how many haunts can say
Death came through their doors?

05:32.419 --> 05:34.116
Mr. Carter, we need
to know when the deceased

05:34.159 --> 05:35.204
first appeared
on your property.

05:35.247 --> 05:37.162
Do you have any idea?

05:37.206 --> 05:38.642
Uh, not really. Um...

05:38.686 --> 05:40.165
I mean,
we're open year-round,

05:40.209 --> 05:41.906
and I give my people
a lot of creative freedom

05:41.950 --> 05:43.386
to swap out props and gags.

05:43.430 --> 05:45.214
You know, you got
- to keep it fresh.
- Mm.

05:45.257 --> 05:47.303
Oh, uh...
my assistant can answer.

05:51.525 --> 05:54.005
You're asking
about Fred, right?

05:54.049 --> 05:56.181
Uh... He's been here
five months.

05:56.225 --> 05:58.227
I'm sorry.
Who's Fred?

05:58.270 --> 05:59.881
The mannequin that fell.

05:59.924 --> 06:01.099
Fred.

06:01.143 --> 06:02.405
That's what us
Necropolites call him

06:02.449 --> 06:04.538
in our little fan club.

06:05.756 --> 06:06.931
Do you come here a lot?

06:06.975 --> 06:08.629
Oh, yes.
As much as I can.

06:08.672 --> 06:10.500
I know the place
inside and out.

06:10.544 --> 06:12.763
Every way in
and every way out?

06:12.807 --> 06:15.592
And every ghost, goblin,
and ghoul in between, hmm.

06:16.637 --> 06:19.379
And you're sure that
Fred has been here...

06:19.422 --> 06:21.424
Yes, since April 15.
Tax Day.

06:21.468 --> 06:25.515
That's why I named him Fred,
after my accountant who...

06:25.559 --> 06:27.169
died.

06:29.954 --> 06:32.740
Fred's such
a special creature.

06:32.783 --> 06:35.438
You know? He's...

06:35.482 --> 06:40.704
I wish I could say goodbye
just one last time.

06:42.489 --> 06:44.795
Okay, um, would you...
would you mind

06:44.839 --> 06:46.493
just staying put for
one second, Mister...?

06:46.536 --> 06:47.494
Farrow.

06:47.537 --> 06:49.539
But please, it's Gene.

06:49.583 --> 06:51.933
And I'm happy
to stick around.

06:51.976 --> 06:53.325
Thank you.

06:54.936 --> 06:58.679
I've got a guy at the tape
with a real Dahmer vibe,

06:58.722 --> 07:01.508
and he basically just admitted
to touching the victim's face.

07:01.551 --> 07:02.813
Who? Show me.

07:05.860 --> 07:09.341
Um, I need an ATL on a man.
About five six,

07:09.385 --> 07:11.605
150 pounds.
A dark gray hoodie.

07:11.648 --> 07:13.781
Um, bald.
I-I-I just lost him.

07:13.824 --> 07:15.260
I'm right here.

07:17.262 --> 07:19.134
Sir, you're on the wrong
side of the tape.

07:19.177 --> 07:21.702
- You can't be here.
- No, no, please.
This is where I belong.

07:21.745 --> 07:23.660
In our crime scene?

07:23.704 --> 07:25.880
It's my scene, too.
In a way.

07:25.923 --> 07:27.795
I've been here
since the beginning.

07:27.838 --> 07:30.450
I really want to see
how it ends.

07:31.538 --> 07:33.409
Yeah.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.845
So do we.

07:43.071 --> 07:46.248

07:46.291 --> 07:49.294

Really appreciate

08:13.318 --> 08:15.059
you taking the time
to talk to us, Mr. Farrow.

08:15.103 --> 08:16.539
It's Gene.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.106
And it's no trouble.

08:20.412 --> 08:25.026
Your prints do appear to be
all over the victim's face.

08:25.069 --> 08:27.028
I'm sure they were.

08:27.071 --> 08:29.204
I always thought
he was beautiful.

08:29.247 --> 08:31.989
I actually make
creatures myself.

08:32.033 --> 08:33.513
I have a little workshop.

08:33.556 --> 08:35.123
Is that what you do
for work, Mr. Farrow?

08:35.166 --> 08:36.124
Make creatures?

08:36.167 --> 08:38.866
It's Gene. Gene.

08:38.909 --> 08:40.650
And no.

08:40.694 --> 08:42.478
I'm the building
superintendent where I live.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.262
253 West Orange.

08:44.306 --> 08:47.527
Um... that's right up
the block from Necropolis.

08:47.570 --> 08:48.571
Yes.

08:48.615 --> 08:49.833
How often do you visit?

08:49.877 --> 08:51.966
Four or five times
a week, I'd say.

08:52.009 --> 08:55.578
I've always loved horror, see?

08:56.405 --> 09:00.235
When I was little, my condition
kept me out of the sun.

09:00.278 --> 09:01.715
It's, uh, vitiligo.

09:01.758 --> 09:03.630
I burn very easily,

09:03.673 --> 09:07.155
so I just stayed in
and pretended I was a vampire.

09:07.198 --> 09:09.200
Feasting on innocent victims?

09:10.767 --> 09:13.596
Dracula is always misunderstood.

09:17.121 --> 09:20.864
- Um, let's get back to Fred.
- Okay.

09:20.908 --> 09:23.606
Now, you said that you...

09:23.650 --> 09:25.608
- named him.
- Mm-hmm.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.828
I was just wondering, um...

09:29.003 --> 09:31.701
Well, was that his real name?

09:35.879 --> 09:37.838
: Oh.

09:37.881 --> 09:40.449
You think I killed him.

09:44.018 --> 09:45.280
You do.

09:45.323 --> 09:47.804
Don't you?

09:47.848 --> 09:50.546
Well, I am trying
to solve this murder,

09:50.590 --> 09:53.027
so I'm taking a close look
at everyone, Mr. Farrow.

09:53.070 --> 09:54.289
It's Gene!

09:55.377 --> 09:57.858
And I had nothing
to do with this.

09:57.901 --> 09:59.816
I didn't even know...

10:01.078 --> 10:03.254
Am I free to go?

10:03.298 --> 10:05.082
You're the one that volunteered
to talk to us, remember?

10:05.126 --> 10:06.649
No one's keeping you here.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.477
Right.

10:16.659 --> 10:18.269
It's Gene.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.367
Jack, I can't take measurements
with you in my light.

10:29.411 --> 10:31.805
Sonya, are you trying
to ask me nicely to move?

10:31.848 --> 10:33.763
It's like you want me
to stab you.

10:33.807 --> 10:35.330
I already
measured the shell.

10:35.373 --> 10:36.984
3,154 microns.

10:37.027 --> 10:39.160
Did you calibrate
the calipers?

10:39.203 --> 10:40.378
Hey, Hugo.

10:40.422 --> 10:41.858
Guess who's back?

10:44.208 --> 10:47.255
If you're looking for
Dr. Ramirez, he's in Vienna.

10:47.298 --> 10:48.996
Sorry, what?

10:49.039 --> 10:51.433
Some gallery there gave him
a big art show, and...

10:51.476 --> 10:52.652
Yeah.

10:52.695 --> 10:54.915
Wow, that's, uh...

10:54.958 --> 10:56.612
Yeah, no, good for him.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.006
I'm Allie.
This one's mine.

10:59.049 --> 11:03.750
3,157 microns.

11:03.793 --> 11:05.360
I'm Sonya.

11:05.403 --> 11:07.449
Sonya Nikolayevich.
Head Medical Examiner.

11:07.492 --> 11:09.494
Jack Nikolayevich.
Her older brother.

11:09.538 --> 11:11.714
My assistant.

11:11.758 --> 11:13.716
So...

11:13.760 --> 11:17.111
Your 4-19.
The Painted Man.

11:17.154 --> 11:20.723
He is about six foot two,
200 pounds.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.812
35 to 45 years old.

11:22.856 --> 11:25.162
PMI puts death about
five months ago.

11:25.206 --> 11:26.294
Well, that's right
when he turned up.

11:26.337 --> 11:27.904
He's had a rough time in there.

11:27.948 --> 11:29.906
The shell created
an ideal environment

11:29.950 --> 11:31.734
for anaerobic
bacterial hydrolysis.

11:31.778 --> 11:33.475
His organs, muscles, skin--

11:33.518 --> 11:35.651
all of it--
was reduced to adipocere.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.746
The fingers on his right
hand are broken.

11:43.790 --> 11:44.878
Correct.

11:44.921 --> 11:46.967
Two fractured
distal phalanges.

11:47.010 --> 11:49.534
Right where he cracked open.
Probably from the fall.

11:50.622 --> 11:53.495
If you don't mind, um,
I'd actually like to help.

11:53.538 --> 11:56.759
My, uh, thesis was actually
on rates of decomposition

11:56.803 --> 11:58.761
in unique environments.

11:58.805 --> 12:00.720
- You're Ahalya Rajan.
- Mm-hmm.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.766
I read that paper.

12:03.810 --> 12:06.203
Stay.
I could use the help.

12:15.212 --> 12:16.648
Hey, boss.

12:16.692 --> 12:18.999
"Git in here"?
What's going on?

12:19.042 --> 12:22.959
That was a formal invitation
to an informal investigation.

12:23.003 --> 12:25.396
We do not have
enough evidence

12:25.440 --> 12:27.442
to open up an official case
into a disappearance.

12:27.485 --> 12:29.400
- Grace Huang.
- One of your
scholarship students?

12:29.444 --> 12:32.099
Rockstar in my program.

12:32.142 --> 12:33.927
I got her a job at
the Eclipse to pay bills

12:33.970 --> 12:36.625
until she could graduate
and start here.

12:36.668 --> 12:38.235
How long has she been missing?

12:38.279 --> 12:39.759
She left work
one night last month

12:39.802 --> 12:41.151
and no one's
seen her since.

12:41.195 --> 12:44.241
When Catherine asked
around at the casino,

12:44.285 --> 12:45.677
they fired her.

12:45.721 --> 12:47.723
You think your partners
at the Eclipse...

12:47.767 --> 12:50.421
Look, I don't know
how they're involved,

12:50.465 --> 12:52.728
but I had to break
into my own office

12:52.772 --> 12:54.295
to get my file on Grace.

12:54.338 --> 12:57.167
I do have
surveillance footage

12:57.211 --> 13:00.040
that I got from a friend
at the Eclipse.

13:00.083 --> 13:02.564
- Mm.
- I mean, this has to be
your own decision, Joshua.

13:02.607 --> 13:04.479
I can do my best
to protect you, but

13:04.522 --> 13:05.785
you know, if you get caught...

13:10.877 --> 13:12.269
Let's find your friend.

13:30.374 --> 13:33.160
There must be at least
50 distinct layers here.

13:34.465 --> 13:37.251
I guess he just
kept painting Fred

13:37.294 --> 13:40.341
until he was rigid
enough to stand upright.

13:40.384 --> 13:42.909
Might have cause here.

13:42.952 --> 13:44.214
Could be postmortem,

13:44.258 --> 13:45.912
but looks like
enough blunt force

13:45.955 --> 13:47.304
and penetrating
trauma to do it.

13:47.348 --> 13:48.566
What causes
a wound like that?

13:48.610 --> 13:49.872
A wrench?

13:49.916 --> 13:51.482
Maybe that hammer
in the conservatory?

13:51.526 --> 13:53.484
There's
no hammer in <i>Clue.</i>

13:53.528 --> 13:55.486
I'm sorry, have you ever
beaten me at a board game?

13:55.530 --> 13:58.533
Whoa! Uh...
Max said you might need me?

13:58.576 --> 14:00.665
Yeah, we do. Uh...

14:00.709 --> 14:02.232
DNA is dissolved.

14:02.276 --> 14:04.495
So, without fingers to print
or a face to match

14:04.539 --> 14:07.934
in missing persons,
all that's left is dental.

14:07.977 --> 14:10.110
We don't like dental?

14:10.153 --> 14:12.808
Without a presumed-to-be name,
forensic odontology

14:12.852 --> 14:14.723
- can take months.
- Ah.

14:14.766 --> 14:18.248
I might have a faster way
to find out who Fred really is.

14:18.292 --> 14:22.035
Um... you're pretty good
with putty, right?

14:22.078 --> 14:24.864
I lowered the silicone
curing rate by 15%

14:24.907 --> 14:27.910
when I worked at Dow,
so, no, I'm not "pretty good."

14:27.954 --> 14:29.738
I'm your huckleberry.

14:29.781 --> 14:31.740
Let's do it.

14:48.278 --> 14:49.845
There.

14:49.889 --> 14:50.977
That's Grace.

14:51.020 --> 14:52.456
End of her shift,
headed home.

14:52.500 --> 14:53.849
She looks happy.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.633
Always.
It's infectious.

14:55.677 --> 14:57.331
Not seeing any signs
of distress.

14:57.374 --> 14:58.462
Mm.

15:00.595 --> 15:02.379
She's not being followed.

15:02.423 --> 15:04.468
She's headed
to that silver Camry.

15:04.512 --> 15:05.948
That's Grace's car.

15:05.992 --> 15:07.428
Where'd she go?

15:07.471 --> 15:09.952
She never made it over here.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.954
Is there really not a camera

15:11.998 --> 15:14.000
covering the area
between those angles?

15:15.740 --> 15:17.264
The only other
movement is that SUV.

15:17.307 --> 15:18.352
That's one of ours.

15:18.395 --> 15:19.527
Takes whales to the airport.

15:19.570 --> 15:22.269
You think
she was pulled into it?

15:22.312 --> 15:24.575
We got to get a look
at that vehicle.

15:24.619 --> 15:26.664
I doubt Jodi can get us
that car without questions.

15:26.708 --> 15:28.144
And forget
about a warrant.

15:28.188 --> 15:30.103
There's no official case.

15:30.146 --> 15:32.627
Well, there's nothing official
about the guy I'm calling.

15:43.072 --> 15:44.987
I think he's ready
for his close-up.

15:46.510 --> 15:48.686
Okay, searching missing persons

15:48.730 --> 15:51.254
around the time Fred appeared
at the haunted house.

15:53.213 --> 15:55.041
Everybody,
meet Tim Harker.

15:55.084 --> 15:57.130
A missing person...

15:57.173 --> 15:59.045
not named Fred.

15:59.088 --> 16:00.350
Mm.

16:00.394 --> 16:02.744
Mr. Harker was 36.

16:02.787 --> 16:04.485
A veterinarian assistant.

16:04.528 --> 16:07.357
His fiancée reported
him missing.

16:07.401 --> 16:09.751
Looks like he got taken from
his home five months ago.

16:09.794 --> 16:11.231
He sure didn't get far.

16:11.274 --> 16:12.884
Lived right up the street
from the haunted house.

16:12.928 --> 16:15.409
You know who manages
the apartment complex next door?

16:15.452 --> 16:16.627
Who?

16:29.031 --> 16:30.641
I-I don't understand.

16:30.685 --> 16:33.557
If-if you found Tim, then...
then why can't I see him?

16:33.601 --> 16:36.343
Why-why can't... Ms. Tran,
your fiancé's body is...

16:37.213 --> 16:38.736
The state it's in.

16:38.780 --> 16:40.216
You don't want to put
yourself through that.

16:40.260 --> 16:42.044
But you're sure it's him?

16:42.088 --> 16:43.567
Yeah.

16:43.611 --> 16:47.049
Can you take us through
the morning he went missing?

16:47.093 --> 16:50.096
I-I just came home
- from a double.
- Mm-hmm.

16:50.139 --> 16:51.880
I thought Tim would be
eating his oatmeal,

16:51.923 --> 16:53.360
<i>like normal.</i>

16:53.403 --> 16:55.231
<i>But instead,
this place is trashed.</i>

16:55.275 --> 16:57.929
<i>His chair, that bookcase,
everything's knocked over.</i>

17:03.500 --> 17:06.329
All this time, I-I couldn't
get rid of Tim's stuff.

17:06.373 --> 17:08.984
Seeing it all
gave me hope

17:09.028 --> 17:10.855
that...
that he might...

17:12.248 --> 17:14.816
When we found Tim,

17:14.859 --> 17:16.818
this man was at the scene.

17:16.861 --> 17:19.081
He's part of the group
they call Necropolites?

17:19.125 --> 17:20.996
- The haunted house people.
- Yeah.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.085
- They did not like Tim.
- We saw
on Tim's Facebook,

17:23.129 --> 17:24.260
he wanted the haunted
house shut down?

17:24.304 --> 17:27.046
Do you think
that guy killed Tim

17:27.089 --> 17:28.525
over a stupid
haunted house?

17:28.569 --> 17:30.527
- It is a theory.
- I begged Tim

17:30.571 --> 17:32.486
to make peace
with the owner there,

17:32.529 --> 17:34.618
but he refused to set
- foot in that place.
- Boss?

17:34.662 --> 17:36.838
- Bosses?
- Come on.

17:36.881 --> 17:38.622
- Boss people?
- Any luck in the kitchen?

17:38.666 --> 17:40.624
Oh, luminol's having
a field day.

17:40.668 --> 17:43.149
It's probably all bleach,
but I'll just keep testing.

17:43.192 --> 17:44.628
Check it out.

17:44.672 --> 17:46.543
Same blue dust
I found next to the body.

17:46.587 --> 17:49.416
Metal scrap, from mill work
at the haunted house.

17:49.459 --> 17:51.157
Are you sure?
Mm.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.550
If it's here and there,
then that means...

17:53.594 --> 17:55.509
- Nothing.
- Are you sure?

17:55.552 --> 17:57.424
- Mm-hmm.
- It sounded like Tim
never went to Necropolis.

17:57.467 --> 17:58.729
This-this could be from
the killer's shoes.

17:58.773 --> 18:00.383
Or someone else's.

18:04.822 --> 18:06.868
Booties.
Oh, my God.

18:06.911 --> 18:08.043
We're supposed
to wear booties.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.001
I-I...
Man, I'm sorry.

18:10.045 --> 18:12.656
- I'm so sorry.
- Did you track
that dust in, Beau?

18:12.700 --> 18:14.354
I don't know,
I-I, I mean,

18:14.397 --> 18:15.703
I've been working in the area,
but the-the-the dust--

18:15.746 --> 18:17.487
The-the-the dust,
the dust doesn't count.

18:17.531 --> 18:18.488
Not anymore.

18:18.532 --> 18:20.273
It's tainted evidence.

18:20.316 --> 18:21.926
We can't use it
to put the killer here.

18:21.970 --> 18:23.624
We can't... Listen.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.452
We need more than dust.

18:25.495 --> 18:27.018
We need a murder weapon.

18:27.062 --> 18:28.759
We need to know
where this man was painted.

18:28.803 --> 18:30.370
Where he was taken.

18:30.413 --> 18:32.459
Mistakes happen.
We adjust.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.299
Oh, there he is.

18:46.342 --> 18:47.865
I owe you one, Trey.

18:47.909 --> 18:49.911
- No way, man.
- You sure you won't
get in trouble?

18:49.954 --> 18:51.391
I'm not that good
at my job.

18:51.434 --> 18:52.827
Tow the wrong car
at least twice a month.

18:52.870 --> 18:54.220
What's one more
little mix-up, right?

18:54.263 --> 18:55.917
: God.
Miss you, stranger.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.048
You ought to
come around more.

18:57.092 --> 18:58.485
My sister asks
about you.

18:58.528 --> 19:00.617
Yeah, tell her, uh,
tell her I said hi.

19:00.661 --> 19:02.576
Hell no, I won't.
Ha, ha.

19:02.619 --> 19:04.186
All right, look, text me
whenever you're done

19:04.230 --> 19:05.231
with whatever,
- you know, this is.
- All right.

19:05.274 --> 19:06.667
- All right, thanks.
- Pick her up.

19:08.103 --> 19:09.278
Hey. What's up?

19:09.322 --> 19:11.715
Hey. Look what I got.

19:11.759 --> 19:14.196
My buddy won't say a word. Really.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.589
We go way back.

19:15.632 --> 19:18.026
Vegas born and raised.
I know the type.

19:18.069 --> 19:19.506
Big fan of the type.

19:19.549 --> 19:20.985
Let's see where the nav system

19:21.029 --> 19:22.770
says this car has been.

19:22.813 --> 19:25.599
Okay. Two trips the day
she disappeared.

19:25.642 --> 19:28.341
One to a gas station.

19:28.384 --> 19:29.646
And the other...

19:29.690 --> 19:31.953
60 miles into Ralston Desert.

19:33.520 --> 19:34.912
Wonder what's out there.

19:34.956 --> 19:36.479
Nothing good.

19:43.094 --> 19:45.575
Paint. No trace.

19:49.971 --> 19:52.408
No trace.

19:52.452 --> 19:54.018
Huh.

19:54.062 --> 19:57.848
FTIR says the paint is
industrial grade latex.

19:57.892 --> 20:01.200
The stuff you use to stop
metal from rusting.

20:02.157 --> 20:04.464
Cool.

20:04.507 --> 20:07.423
Are you not gonna tell me
the history of latex paint?

20:10.687 --> 20:12.385
Are you still thinking
about earlier?

20:12.428 --> 20:14.996
My massive screwup?
Just a bit.

20:15.039 --> 20:17.520
Hey. I was
too hard on you.

20:17.564 --> 20:20.001
Okay? Please don't be
too hard on yourself.

20:20.044 --> 20:23.396
What do you tell your kids
when they make a mistake?

20:23.439 --> 20:25.354
That I'm deeply ashamed of them,

20:25.398 --> 20:26.834
but their mother
still loves them.

20:26.877 --> 20:30.403
All right, then, Beau.

20:30.446 --> 20:32.579
Your mother
still loves you.

20:32.622 --> 20:33.797
No moping.

20:35.538 --> 20:36.974
All right.
Let me help you out.

20:37.018 --> 20:38.889
Yes, please.[chuckles] Okay.

20:38.933 --> 20:41.196
We need to find something
that shows Gene's the one

20:41.240 --> 20:42.502
who painted this body.

20:54.818 --> 20:58.082
What have we here?

21:03.044 --> 21:04.872
Check this out.

21:07.788 --> 21:09.485
More blue metal dust.

21:09.529 --> 21:11.879
Mm.
Between paint layers.

21:11.922 --> 21:13.881
That didn't come off
the bottom of your trainers.

21:13.924 --> 21:15.578
You think the victim
got painted at Necropolis?

21:15.622 --> 21:17.711
Gene did say
he knew every way in

21:17.754 --> 21:19.756
and every way out
- of that place.
- Yeah, but...

21:19.800 --> 21:21.932
he couldn't turn a man
into a mannequin

21:21.976 --> 21:23.499
in the middle
of a crowd, right?

21:27.590 --> 21:29.549
There's Michael Myers again.

21:29.592 --> 21:31.768
He doesn't look
too happy to see us.

21:31.812 --> 21:33.596
Nikki, you got
to keep it moving.

21:33.640 --> 21:35.337
We can't have 'em
bottlenecking like before.

21:35.381 --> 21:36.469
Copy that.

21:36.512 --> 21:37.992
Fans sure don't scare easy.

21:38.035 --> 21:39.820
Eh, a body cracking open
like an Easter egg?

21:39.863 --> 21:41.822
You got to admit, pretty great.

21:41.865 --> 21:43.519
Uh, that "body" has a name.

21:43.563 --> 21:45.304
One you know, actually.

21:45.347 --> 21:46.522
Tim Harker.

21:46.566 --> 21:48.132
You're kidding me.

21:48.176 --> 21:50.918
So that's why he shut up.

21:50.961 --> 21:52.528
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

21:52.572 --> 21:54.095
I mean, just...

21:54.138 --> 21:56.140
just 'cause he wanted
us out of business...

21:56.184 --> 21:57.446
I'm...

21:57.490 --> 21:59.448
I'm not a suspect, am I?

21:59.492 --> 22:01.711
'Cause I-I'm not sick enough
to dream up something...

22:07.238 --> 22:09.240
You about to say something?

22:09.284 --> 22:11.417
Sir, someone applied

22:11.460 --> 22:13.984
57 coats of paint
to Mr. Harker's body.

22:14.028 --> 22:16.378
Now, we think
they did it here.

22:16.422 --> 22:19.729
Is there some place that they'd
have enough time or privacy?

22:21.296 --> 22:22.950
Maybe.

22:22.993 --> 22:24.647
If you don't show us,

22:24.691 --> 22:27.041
then you'll be arrested
for obstruction, so...

22:28.042 --> 22:29.652
Right.
Right.

22:35.528 --> 22:38.400
And... here it is.

22:38.444 --> 22:40.620
Uh, gentlemen, excuse me.

22:40.663 --> 22:41.969
Gentlemen?

22:42.012 --> 22:44.667
Um, is this your entire crew?

22:44.711 --> 22:46.669
Who else has access
to this area?

22:46.713 --> 22:48.671
How about
the whole world?

22:48.715 --> 22:50.369
Most of the doors
don't lock.

22:50.412 --> 22:51.631
Security is crap.

22:51.674 --> 22:52.849
It's a damn parade
back here.

22:52.893 --> 22:54.764
Crazy fans sneaking
in for a peek.

22:54.808 --> 22:56.244
This place must
really be haunted.

22:56.287 --> 22:58.377
Our tools sure do have
a way of ghosting.

22:59.900 --> 23:01.423
What's behind this wall?

23:01.467 --> 23:03.512
That's not a wall.
It's a construction flat.

23:06.689 --> 23:08.561
So when was this put up?

23:08.604 --> 23:09.649
About five months ago.

23:11.433 --> 23:14.567
Sorry, guys.
This is coming down.

23:23.227 --> 23:24.968
How about that?

23:26.143 --> 23:27.928
That's a lot of paint.

23:41.028 --> 23:43.770
They didn't just paint him here.

23:43.813 --> 23:45.641
They killed him, too.

23:55.216 --> 23:56.783
<i>I can't think of a happy reason</i>

23:56.826 --> 23:58.698
<i>anyone would drive
Grace out here.</i>

23:58.741 --> 24:00.569
<i>You have arrived
at your destination.</i>

24:00.613 --> 24:03.224
Not to second-guess
sultry map lady,

24:03.267 --> 24:04.617
but we sure this is the spot?

24:04.660 --> 24:06.183
SUV stopped here,

24:06.227 --> 24:07.271
turned around
and went back to the Eclipse.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.536
All right, so...

24:10.579 --> 24:12.059
Blue is for
undisturbed ground.

24:12.102 --> 24:13.234
Red is...

24:13.277 --> 24:15.279
Not what we're
hoping for.

24:27.814 --> 24:29.598
So, what?
We're all suspects now?

24:29.642 --> 24:31.557
Just elimination
prints, bud.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.254
You and your guys
belong here.

24:33.297 --> 24:34.951
We think we might find
someone who doesn't.

24:34.995 --> 24:37.258
Whoa.
This place is a mess.

24:37.301 --> 24:40.653
Carter could make some real
money bringing CSIs back here.

24:40.696 --> 24:43.525
A high-traffic crime scene.

24:43.569 --> 24:44.961
It's my nightmare.

24:45.005 --> 24:46.354
I got to admit, I don't even
know where to begin.

24:46.397 --> 24:49.009
A murder weapon
would be a start.

24:49.052 --> 24:51.359
Somebody punched
a very strange hole

24:51.402 --> 24:54.144
in Tim Harker's braincase,
right where we are.

24:54.188 --> 24:55.798
And don't be shy
with your luminol.

24:55.842 --> 24:57.757
You might find
- what they used.
- Well, I can try.

24:57.800 --> 25:01.543
But what if,
in some crazy scheme

25:01.587 --> 25:03.502
to avoid getting captured,

25:03.545 --> 25:05.852
the killer disposed of
the murder weapon, huh?

25:05.895 --> 25:07.027
Ooh.

25:08.332 --> 25:11.292
- Tough crowd.
- Sorry.
Found an eyelash.

25:11.335 --> 25:12.859
A white eyelash?

25:12.902 --> 25:14.077
There can't be
that many people

25:14.121 --> 25:15.949
walking around
with a white eyelash.

25:15.992 --> 25:18.952
Gene Farrow has vitiligo.

25:18.995 --> 25:22.172
So, care to explain
how your eyelash ended up

25:22.216 --> 25:24.697
in the Employees Only section
of the haunted house?

25:24.740 --> 25:27.090
:
Well...

25:27.134 --> 25:29.484
I have snuck back there
a few times.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.312
To see how the alien
autopsy room is coming.

25:31.355 --> 25:33.314
- It's really exciting.
- So...

25:33.357 --> 25:35.490
just curious.
That's all?

25:37.318 --> 25:39.015
No.

25:39.059 --> 25:42.976
I might have borrowed some tools
for a special project.

25:43.019 --> 25:45.282
We are going to need to look
at those tools, Mr. Farrow.

25:45.326 --> 25:46.588
It's G...

25:48.895 --> 25:50.418
They're in my bedroom.

25:56.642 --> 25:57.947
Ah, this is such
a strange feeling.

25:57.991 --> 25:59.819
Nobody's ever seen
these guys before.

26:03.823 --> 26:05.128
Wow.

26:05.172 --> 26:07.740
I mean... wow.

26:07.783 --> 26:09.437
Thank you.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.265
I-I really am proud of them.

26:11.308 --> 26:13.223
Arrest him.
What?

26:17.010 --> 26:19.099
Oh, Gene.

26:19.142 --> 26:20.448
Oh, no, no.

26:20.491 --> 26:21.623
:
No, no, no.

26:21.667 --> 26:23.016
I-I'm innocent.

26:23.059 --> 26:24.539
You have the right
to remain silent.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.628
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

26:26.672 --> 26:27.847
in a court of law.

26:27.890 --> 26:29.675
You have the right
for an attorney.

26:29.718 --> 26:31.154
If you can't afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you.

26:31.198 --> 26:34.593
Hey.
What just happened?

26:37.900 --> 26:40.468
That ain't good...

26:40.511 --> 26:41.556
but it's not evidence.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.166
That man's going behind bars.

26:43.210 --> 26:44.559
And if you want him
to stay there...

26:44.603 --> 26:46.343
He admitted to
trespassing and burglary.

26:46.387 --> 26:47.388
The arrest is justified.

26:47.431 --> 26:49.651
That's a 24-hour hold.

26:49.695 --> 26:51.566
Wind the clock forward a day,

26:51.610 --> 26:54.090
you got nothing tying
him to the murder.

26:54.134 --> 26:55.831
He is back out on the street

26:55.875 --> 26:58.312
and you just made a man
who lives like this

26:58.355 --> 26:59.792
angry.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.574
That looks like...

27:45.402 --> 27:47.013
Dig carefully.

27:54.020 --> 27:56.675
This is as deep as it goes.
There's... there's nothing here.

28:01.810 --> 28:03.290
Maybe there never was.

28:03.333 --> 28:05.335
Showed her an empty hole
to scare her,

28:05.379 --> 28:06.772
told her to disappear?

28:06.815 --> 28:09.252
All right,
and then filled it back in?

28:09.296 --> 28:11.080
They know I'm looking.

28:11.124 --> 28:12.473
They moved her body.

28:13.909 --> 28:15.084
Well...

28:15.128 --> 28:16.564
let's get this back
to the lab.

28:16.607 --> 28:20.176
We can sift for trace there.

28:46.594 --> 28:47.900
Please tell me
you found something.

28:47.943 --> 28:49.205
I wish I could.
I-I combed through

28:49.249 --> 28:50.467
the entire apartment.
No dice.

28:50.511 --> 28:52.121
Gene is out in 14 hours.

28:52.165 --> 28:54.602
He's made a mistake somewhere.
Check it all again.

28:59.215 --> 29:01.130
Hey.
There you are.

29:01.174 --> 29:02.958
Heard you were having
a tough time.

29:05.526 --> 29:07.746
Can't find
- the murder weapon.
- Mm-hmm.

29:07.789 --> 29:09.791
It's a strange object.
Blunt force.

29:09.835 --> 29:11.314
Happened in this room.

29:11.358 --> 29:12.751
I was hoping the killer
might have cleaned

29:12.794 --> 29:14.883
the tool he used
and put it back, but...

29:14.927 --> 29:17.756
I need to reprocess everything.

29:17.799 --> 29:19.322
We need to.

29:19.366 --> 29:22.238
Are you sure
Serena won't mind?

29:23.457 --> 29:25.459
It's gonna be a long night.

29:26.503 --> 29:28.418
Well, then, can we get
some more light in here?

29:28.462 --> 29:30.638
I don't have
raccoon vision like you.

29:33.597 --> 29:35.077
Whoa.

29:35.121 --> 29:36.992
Wow, that,
that thing is loud.

29:37.036 --> 29:39.342
Tell me about it!

29:39.386 --> 29:41.605
I wonder how they're gonna
get that out of here?

29:41.649 --> 29:43.651
Pieces, probably.

29:45.653 --> 29:46.828
Pieces.

29:46.872 --> 29:47.960
What?

30:10.156 --> 30:12.985
You see?

30:13.028 --> 30:14.116
You didn't need all night.

30:14.160 --> 30:16.031
Just needed a little
Folsom Time.

30:18.120 --> 30:21.428
The heat from the saw
must've cooked the oil

30:21.471 --> 30:22.646
in the latent.

30:22.690 --> 30:24.648
- Huh.
- So you can forget about DNA.

30:24.692 --> 30:26.215
- Print's too faint to lift.
- Mm-hmm.

30:26.259 --> 30:27.956
I don't know.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.437
There's something I learned
in one of my FBI classes.

30:30.480 --> 30:33.222
Fluorescent
fingerprint tagging.

30:33.266 --> 30:35.224
Hmm.

30:35.268 --> 30:38.097
You tent and fume.

30:38.140 --> 30:40.839
But instead of counting on
the cyanoacrylate

30:40.882 --> 30:42.405
to capture,

30:42.449 --> 30:44.886
it's just a sticky base
for Lycopodium powder.

30:44.930 --> 30:47.889
This stuff's so fine,

30:47.933 --> 30:53.068
it adheres where regular
print powders can't.

30:53.112 --> 30:58.160
And fluoresces under UV light.

31:01.772 --> 31:03.687
Hope you got an A+
in that class.

31:03.731 --> 31:06.125
I'll give you partial credit.

31:07.604 --> 31:09.215
That's not our guy.

31:09.258 --> 31:11.434
You've matched one of
the elimination prints.

31:11.478 --> 31:12.696
What?

31:12.740 --> 31:14.437
- Who-who's Lue Jasper?
- We met him.

31:14.481 --> 31:16.265
<i>He works construction
at the haunted house expansion.</i>

31:16.309 --> 31:18.964
He operates that machine
on a daily basis.

31:19.007 --> 31:21.444
His print there,
it doesn't mean a thing.

31:21.488 --> 31:23.751
We've still got
nothing on Gene.

31:23.794 --> 31:24.883
He's...

31:24.926 --> 31:26.493
He's gonna get out.

31:52.301 --> 31:55.348
You know, when I was eight,
I had this Bratz doll.

31:55.391 --> 31:58.351
Detective Alicia Keys.

31:58.394 --> 32:00.266
Took her everywhere with me.

32:00.309 --> 32:01.484
You?

32:01.528 --> 32:04.226
I was, uh,
never much for dolls.

32:05.706 --> 32:08.448
I'm still learning
how to play with them.

32:13.322 --> 32:17.544
So, what kind of paint
your guy use on Lil' Allie?

32:17.587 --> 32:19.285
It doesn't match.

32:20.547 --> 32:23.332
That's was acrylic, and it looks
like it was applied differently.

32:23.376 --> 32:25.726
Well, Gene's not
covering a body.

32:25.769 --> 32:28.555
Maybe... maybe his
style's evolving, too.

32:28.598 --> 32:30.426
Well, there's lots of
possible explanations.

32:30.470 --> 32:32.385
There's just no proof.

32:32.428 --> 32:34.039
I can't use this
to link him

32:34.082 --> 32:35.605
to Tim Harker's murder.

32:37.042 --> 32:38.608
What time is it?

32:42.395 --> 32:44.223
<i>Gene Farrow's
getting out of jail?</i>

32:44.266 --> 32:46.529
Right now, all we can prove
is that he stole some tools,

32:46.573 --> 32:49.663
but if any we can link any
of them to Tim's abduction...

32:49.706 --> 32:52.100
Well, please.
Stay as long as it takes.

33:00.674 --> 33:02.763
Ugh.

33:02.806 --> 33:04.199
Beau, you got to stop
beating yourself up

33:04.243 --> 33:05.200
over the whole shoe thing.

33:05.244 --> 33:07.507
No.
We missed it.

33:14.166 --> 33:16.342
Okay, okay.

33:16.385 --> 33:18.474
Okay, so what are y'all
so excited about?

33:18.518 --> 33:20.085
I think that I screwed up
when I thought I screwed up.

33:20.128 --> 33:21.390
But the real screwup--

33:21.434 --> 33:23.044
Slow down, man.

33:23.088 --> 33:24.741
I don't think I contaminated
the victim's bedroom at all.

33:24.785 --> 33:26.569
I found these on a shelf
in Tim's closet.

33:26.613 --> 33:27.875
Blue dust in the treads.

33:27.918 --> 33:29.659
I sure as heck
didn't walk there.

33:29.703 --> 33:32.923
So, do you think that the victim
tracked this stuff in after all?

33:32.967 --> 33:34.534
Actually, we're not so sure.

33:34.577 --> 33:38.103
Those are nine and a half,
and Tim was six foot two.

33:38.146 --> 33:39.234
And then...

33:40.279 --> 33:42.324
...there's this.

33:42.368 --> 33:44.370
Do these belong...

33:44.413 --> 33:46.111
Gene is a little guy.

33:46.154 --> 33:47.329
I don't know why
he would leave his shoes

33:47.373 --> 33:48.504
in the victim's bedroom.

33:48.548 --> 33:50.637
Then again,
why paint a dead body?

33:50.680 --> 33:52.465
Or turn me into
a Cabbage Patch doll?

33:52.508 --> 33:54.728
Let's find out
whose shoes these are.

33:54.771 --> 33:57.861
Then we can ask all
the questions we want.

33:59.428 --> 34:00.821
- Hey, Beau.
- Yeah?

34:00.864 --> 34:02.083
Thank you.

34:04.738 --> 34:07.088
All right.

34:22.364 --> 34:25.715
Now, I did not
see that coming. No.

34:28.153 --> 34:29.937
Is someone gonna tell me
why I'm here?

34:29.980 --> 34:31.808
I can.

34:31.852 --> 34:33.549
You killed Tim Harker.

34:33.593 --> 34:34.898
What?

34:34.942 --> 34:35.943
Do you know
what the holy trinity

34:35.986 --> 34:37.814
of crime solving is, Mr. Jasper?

34:37.858 --> 34:41.470
Means, motive, opportunity.

34:41.514 --> 34:44.082
Opportunity.

34:44.125 --> 34:48.434
You work in the same room
where Tim Harker was killed.

34:49.783 --> 34:50.914
And you spend a lot
of time there alone.

34:50.958 --> 34:54.701
Means.

34:54.744 --> 34:57.704
That's your print
on the murder weapon.

34:57.747 --> 34:58.966
Took us a while to find

34:59.009 --> 35:00.620
since you hid it
in your table saw.

35:00.663 --> 35:02.970
If that's my print,
it's because it's my machine.

35:03.013 --> 35:04.363
I work with it
all the time.

35:04.406 --> 35:05.886
Yeah, you're right.

35:05.929 --> 35:08.889
We always knew that you had
opportunity and means.

35:08.932 --> 35:11.152
But we didn't
consider you a suspect

35:11.196 --> 35:13.023
until we found your motive.

35:13.067 --> 35:14.982
What motive?
I don't know that man.

35:15.025 --> 35:16.157
But you know his fiancée.

35:16.201 --> 35:17.202
Biblically, even.

35:17.245 --> 35:19.117
This is crazy.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.205
I-I didn't... Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

35:20.248 --> 35:21.423
Just watch.

35:21.467 --> 35:22.859
That's how little bits

35:22.903 --> 35:24.122
of your work ended up
in her bedroom.

35:29.953 --> 35:31.651
Just pack up a bag
and then we'll go.

35:31.694 --> 35:33.131
Sounds good.

35:36.786 --> 35:39.789
It was your trainers
that tracked that dust in.

35:39.833 --> 35:42.270
Men's clothing
in the living room.

35:42.314 --> 35:44.272
Men's shoes in the closet.

35:46.100 --> 35:48.233
Elena said that was
all Tim's stuff.

35:48.276 --> 35:51.410
But the DNA tests
said otherwise.

35:51.453 --> 35:52.846
It's all yours, Lue.

35:52.889 --> 35:55.370
You're sleeping with
Tim's fiancée.

35:55.414 --> 35:57.981
You have been
since before Tim went missing.

35:58.025 --> 35:59.592
We thought he was abducted.

35:59.635 --> 36:01.071
Now it seems a lot more likely

36:01.115 --> 36:02.334
Tim trashed the place
when he found out.

36:05.467 --> 36:07.469
I don't know why else anyone
would punch that bookcase.

36:09.645 --> 36:13.127
See, you said that
Tim never set foot

36:13.171 --> 36:14.650
in the haunted house.

36:14.694 --> 36:16.609
That's another lie, right?

36:16.652 --> 36:18.959
I mean,
he went in once...

36:20.265 --> 36:22.092
He just never
came back out.

36:22.136 --> 36:24.399
<i>Tim confronted you, right, Lue?</i>

36:24.443 --> 36:25.922
<i>And things got out of hand</i>

36:25.966 --> 36:28.534
<i>and you used a weapon
of convenience.</i>

36:30.710 --> 36:32.625
<i>The table saw's tilt shaft.</i>

36:35.497 --> 36:37.195
<i>But, I mean,
now you had a problem.</i>

36:37.238 --> 36:39.022
<i>What to do with the body.</i>

36:39.066 --> 36:42.809
<i>You'd killed Tim in the back.
No cameras, no tourists.</i>

36:42.852 --> 36:44.245
But getting him out?

36:44.289 --> 36:46.552
Ooh. Impossible.

36:46.595 --> 36:48.510
<i>So you didn't.</i>

36:48.554 --> 36:50.730
<i>You used your surroundings.</i>

36:54.734 --> 36:57.563
<i>A place where
one more creepy monster</i>

36:57.606 --> 36:59.956
<i>would just blend right in.</i>

37:01.915 --> 37:05.005
<i>This wasn't some
horror-obsessed sociopath</i>

37:05.048 --> 37:07.573
living out a deranged
mannequin fetish.

37:07.616 --> 37:09.052
No.

37:09.096 --> 37:11.229
This was just
a run-of-the-mill murderer

37:11.272 --> 37:15.276
covering up a crime
like only he could.

37:19.889 --> 37:21.587
What was I supposed to do, huh?

37:22.979 --> 37:24.154
To get away with murder?

37:24.198 --> 37:25.808
I don't know.

37:25.852 --> 37:28.420
Maybe next time
try 60 coats of paint.

37:30.335 --> 37:32.206
Wha-what is this?

37:32.250 --> 37:33.599
You knew who did it,

37:33.642 --> 37:36.384
you stayed silent,
and you lied to the police.

37:36.428 --> 37:37.820
You're accomplice
after the fact.

37:37.864 --> 37:39.257
But I'm not a killer!

37:39.300 --> 37:41.084
Yeah, and you're still
going to the same place.

37:41.128 --> 37:42.172
Go figure.

37:48.614 --> 37:51.617
Um... Missed a spot.

37:54.794 --> 37:56.578
- Is that tortoiseshell?
- Last I checked,

37:56.622 --> 37:58.580
there weren't many
tortoises roaming around

37:58.624 --> 38:00.278
that far north
in the desert.

38:02.323 --> 38:04.891
Maybe from Grace's
sunglasses?

38:04.934 --> 38:06.414
Hey, it's something.

38:06.458 --> 38:07.807
It ain't much.

38:07.850 --> 38:11.071
No, but we
know what we know.

38:11.114 --> 38:12.594
The amount of bacteria
that I'm finding

38:12.638 --> 38:13.900
suggests remains were
buried there.

38:13.943 --> 38:15.336
Might not give us
an ID, but...

38:15.380 --> 38:16.946
It didn't even
give us a species.

38:16.990 --> 38:20.254
We-we took
a drive to some vacant lot

38:20.298 --> 38:22.038
in the Ralston Desert
that we can't explain,

38:22.082 --> 38:23.736
and all we have is
a hole full of bacteria

38:23.779 --> 38:25.390
and whatever that thing is.

38:25.433 --> 38:27.043
And we still don't have
enough to open up a case.

38:28.784 --> 38:31.047
All right, whoever
this is, I am not...

38:35.400 --> 38:37.358
Okay, yeah.

38:37.402 --> 38:39.578
Uh, uh, look,
I'm sorry to leave you

38:39.621 --> 38:40.753
to clean this mess up.

38:40.796 --> 38:42.755
I got to go.
Yeah. Yeah.

38:57.030 --> 38:58.510
Jodi.

38:58.553 --> 38:59.859
Hey, what's going on?

38:59.902 --> 39:01.295
I mean, we got
to meet in person.

39:01.339 --> 39:02.644
You're calling
from a burner...

39:02.688 --> 39:04.603
- They took my phone.
- Who's they?

39:04.646 --> 39:06.561
I don't know.

39:06.605 --> 39:08.868
- I didn't see him.
- Oh, Jodi.

39:08.911 --> 39:10.609
Your face.

39:10.652 --> 39:13.829
- Who did this?
- I don't know.

39:13.873 --> 39:17.137
And you can't tell anyone.
I'm not going to the police.

39:17.180 --> 39:19.879
- Why not?
- Because he left me
with this.

39:24.797 --> 39:27.626
What have you gotten me
into, Catherine?

39:31.586 --> 39:34.415
All right.
I went to the desert today.

39:34.459 --> 39:36.678
And I found...

39:36.722 --> 39:38.332
It has to be Grace's grave.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.943
And we have got to... No. No.

39:40.987 --> 39:43.206
I'm not doing anything.

39:43.250 --> 39:45.470
Just be careful.

39:45.513 --> 39:47.950
I don't want you to be the next
woman buried in the desert.

39:56.437 --> 39:58.396
<i>Hey, boss?</i>

39:58.439 --> 40:00.746
I'm so sorry.

40:00.789 --> 40:02.574
We got the right guy,
didn't we?

40:02.617 --> 40:03.575
Yeah, I know.

40:03.618 --> 40:05.577
I was just so convinced.

40:05.620 --> 40:06.795
Everybody gets one.

40:08.318 --> 40:11.409
I had a priest arrested
for arson once.

40:11.452 --> 40:13.498
Turns out it was
a freaking nun.

40:13.541 --> 40:15.587
Uh-oh, this the nun story?

40:15.630 --> 40:16.675
You better leave me
alone, Joshua.

40:19.068 --> 40:21.027
Y'all be good.
Good night.

40:21.070 --> 40:23.508
Night, boss.

40:28.251 --> 40:30.253
- What?
- Nothing.

40:30.297 --> 40:33.779
I just, um... I missed this.

40:33.822 --> 40:35.868
Uh-huh. So did I.

40:35.911 --> 40:38.523
Hey, we haven't really had
the chance to talk

40:38.566 --> 40:40.046
since I've been back.

40:43.919 --> 40:45.573
We will.
Ms. Rajan.

40:45.617 --> 40:47.445
Hey, listen, man.
Hey, hey. It's after hours.

40:47.488 --> 40:48.576
If you want me
to call security...

40:48.620 --> 40:49.925
I am supposed to be here.

40:49.969 --> 40:51.492
I was told
that I could come

40:51.536 --> 40:53.407
- and collect this.
- Okay.

40:55.453 --> 40:57.150
Do you want to know
what happened

40:57.193 --> 40:58.847
after my arrest?

40:58.891 --> 41:02.721
Those stolen tools cost me
my job and my place.

41:02.764 --> 41:04.200
I'm getting evicted.

41:04.244 --> 41:06.028
- Gene, I am sorry.
- No, no, no, no.

41:06.072 --> 41:07.508
There's something you

41:07.552 --> 41:09.379
need to understand,

41:09.423 --> 41:11.512
doing what you do.

41:11.556 --> 41:13.732
People who may...

41:13.775 --> 41:15.908
act a little different

41:15.951 --> 41:20.347
or... look a little different,

41:20.390 --> 41:23.481
it doesn't make them
a bad person.

41:25.047 --> 41:26.701
Why did you make that?

41:32.011 --> 41:34.056
You... inspired me.

41:35.928 --> 41:37.233
Mm?

41:39.801 --> 41:42.282
If you don't want me
to have it, here.

41:42.325 --> 41:43.588
Go ahead.

41:44.806 --> 41:47.026
Just... take care of her.

41:50.769 --> 41:53.859
You know, if you don't
want to keep that,

41:53.902 --> 41:55.991
my niece has
a birthday coming up.

41:57.776 --> 41:59.429
Are you gonna hang on to it?

41:59.473 --> 42:01.344
Just collect the whole CSI set?
