[all groaning]

00:18.486 --> 00:20.321
- WOW.

00:20.388 --> 00:22.523
EVERYONE SEEMS REALLY
NOT EXCITED.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.058

00:24.125 --> 00:27.595
WE GET CUPCAKES, PUNCH,

00:27.661 --> 00:29.029

00:36.737 --> 00:39.707

00:41.309 --> 00:42.643

00:42.710 --> 00:45.346
DON'T YOU THINK WE COULD
DO SOMETHING REMOTELY COOL

00:45.413 --> 00:46.780
FOR OUR END-OF-THE-YEAR
SCHOOL PARTY?

00:46.847 --> 00:49.183
- LIKE A DANCE.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.618
- WITH SLOW DANCES.

00:50.684 --> 00:52.953
- AND DATES TO SLOW DANCE WITH.

00:53.020 --> 00:54.955
all: YEAH!

00:55.022 --> 00:57.091
- WELL, WE'VE NEVER HAD
A SCHOOL DANCE BEFORE,

00:57.158 --> 00:59.093
BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY JUST
ONE SMALL CLASSROOM,

00:59.160 --> 01:01.429
BUT IF A CERTAIN BAND
WANTS TO BE

01:01.495 --> 01:03.597
THE NEW SCHOOL DANCE COMMITTEE,
SOUNDS GREAT.

01:03.664 --> 01:07.000
[all cheering]

01:07.135 --> 01:09.637
SO YOU NEED TO FIND A THEME,
SNACKS, DECORATIONS, CHAPERONES,

01:09.703 --> 01:11.172
AND WE HAVE NO MONEY,
NO PLACE TO HAVE IT,

01:11.239 --> 01:12.706
AND SINCE TODAY'S
THE LAST DAY OF SCHOOL,

01:12.773 --> 01:13.874
WE NEED TO HAVE IT TONIGHT.

01:15.176 --> 01:19.147

01:39.066 --> 01:40.734
- * HEY, HEY *

01:40.801 --> 01:42.803
- * DON'T YOU FEEL THE RUSH *

01:42.870 --> 01:44.538

01:44.605 --> 01:45.873

01:50.878 --> 01:52.180
* GO AND MAKE YOUR LUCK *

01:52.246 --> 01:54.848
* WITH THE LIFE YOU CHOOSE *

01:54.915 --> 01:58.452
* IF YOU WANT IT ALL,
LAY IT ON THE LINE *

01:58.519 --> 02:03.457
* IT'S THE ONLY LIFE YOU GOT
SO YOU GOT TO LIVE IT BIG TIME *

02:06.394 --> 02:08.362
- OKAY, THE THEME
OF OUR DANCE IS...

02:08.429 --> 02:09.430
[together]

02:12.200 --> 02:14.302
- OH, HERE COMES KENDALL.

02:14.368 --> 02:15.969
I THINK HE'S GONNA ASK ME
TO THE DANCE.

02:16.036 --> 02:18.406
- JO, HEY I NEED
TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.607

02:19.673 --> 02:21.041
COULD YOU GO TO
THE CONVENIENCE STORE

02:21.108 --> 02:23.444
AND GET THEM TO DONATE
SOME SNACKAGE FOR THE DANCE?

02:23.511 --> 02:26.580
- OH, SURE, KENDALL.

02:28.015 --> 02:31.819
IS THAT THE ONLY THING
YOU WANTED TO ASK ME?

02:31.885 --> 02:34.222
- OH, NO, UM...

02:34.255 --> 02:35.356
COULD GET SOME SODIES TOO?

02:35.423 --> 02:36.890
[record scratch]

02:36.957 --> 02:37.858

DOCTOR'S CONVENTION

03:10.491 --> 03:11.592
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

03:11.659 --> 03:13.060

03:13.126 --> 03:15.529
THEREFORE, I DESPISE THEM...

03:15.596 --> 03:16.497
AND YOU.

03:18.499 --> 03:20.000
STUPID...

03:20.067 --> 03:22.870
HANDCUFFS.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.605

03:24.672 --> 03:26.274
- GOT IT.

03:26.307 --> 03:28.409
THERE'S A WAREHOUSE WE CAN RENT

NOW, WHERE'S L.A.'S
MURDER DISTRICT?

03:30.811 --> 03:32.546

03:32.613 --> 03:35.283
WELL, THAT ONLY LEAVES US
ONE OPTION.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.619
GUSTAVO, WE WERE WONDERING...

03:38.686 --> 03:40.921
[together] CAN WE HAVE

03:43.324 --> 03:46.327
[all shouting at once]

03:46.394 --> 03:48.061
[together] DID YOU SAY YES?

03:48.128 --> 03:52.099
- YOU CAN HAVE YOUR DANCE

03:52.165 --> 03:57.838
YOU MUST SING TONIGHT ONSTAGE
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.308
- WE NEED TO START GETTING
YOU GUYS SOME STAGE PRACTICE.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.676
- AND SINCE YOU WILL BE
TERRIBLE TONIGHT,

04:02.743 --> 04:05.479
AT LEAST THE AUDIENCE WON'T BOO
AND THROW BOTTLES AT YOU.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.648
SO WE GOT A DEAL?

04:07.715 --> 04:09.617

I'M...

05:51.552 --> 05:53.220

05:53.286 --> 05:54.722
- ASKING A GIRL OUT IS EASY.

05:54.788 --> 05:57.825
YOU JUST HAVE TO BE CONFIDENT

05:57.891 --> 05:59.126
HEY.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.285
THAT IS FUNNY, RIGHT?

06:58.351 --> 06:59.820
NO, CHAPERONE.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.922
JUST CHAPERONING IS GOOD.

07:04.858 --> 07:06.393

07:42.429 --> 07:43.531
IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S SOME

07:43.564 --> 07:44.932

07:59.079 --> 08:01.148
AND START DANCING LIKE THIS.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.125
EXQUISITE.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.697
- REMEMBER, PALMWOODS STUDENTS,

08:16.764 --> 08:18.566
THE DANCE IS

08:18.599 --> 08:20.133
SO IF YOU WANT
THAT SPECIAL DATE,

08:20.200 --> 08:23.571
THE TIME TO ASK IS NOW.

08:23.571 --> 08:25.372
- WHY AREN'T WE BEING ASKED

08:25.438 --> 08:26.874
- ARE WE TOO UNAPPROACHABLE?

08:26.940 --> 08:27.975
[buzzer sounds]

08:28.041 --> 08:29.309
[together]
KEEP WALKING, NERDY KID.

08:30.944 --> 08:33.413
- WE CANNOT SHOW UP TO THE DANCE
WITHOUT DATES.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.048
OUR REP WILL BE RUINED.

08:35.115 --> 08:38.852
- ACTUALLY, CARLOS DID ASK US,
BUT WE TURNED HIM DOWN.

08:38.919 --> 08:42.590
- JENNIFERS, I THINK WE ALL KNOW
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.

08:50.463 --> 08:52.132

08:52.199 --> 08:53.667
[together] YOU'RE TAKING US

08:55.703 --> 08:59.940
BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE CARLOS
TO GO AROUND, SO...

09:17.157 --> 09:18.826
I WONDER WHY I DIDN'T
THINK OF THAT.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.328
OH, YEAH,
'CAUSE I'M NOT CRAZY.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.763
[all laughing]

09:37.444 --> 09:38.311

10:00.668 --> 10:02.002

- AH!

10:15.248 --> 10:16.984

10:17.050 --> 10:19.319

BELIEVE THIS,

10:19.386 --> 10:21.889
BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN
ASKED OUT BEFORE.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.323
- NO, I BELIEVE IT.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.659
- THIS IS MY FIRST DANCE,

10:25.726 --> 10:29.462
AND I'D LIKE TO BE ASKED
IN A WAY THAT I CAN REMEMBER,

10:29.529 --> 10:31.164
NOT BY CUE CARDS.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.466
- CUE CARDS?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

10:33.533 --> 10:34.902
ARE YOU GONNA HIT ME
WITH A SHOE?

10:34.968 --> 10:36.403
- NO.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.571
AND I'M NOT LOOKING FOR A PRINCE
TO RIDE UP ON A HORSE,

10:38.638 --> 10:42.142
BUT HOW ABOUT SOMETHING
WITH A LITTLE FLAIR?

10:43.476 --> 10:44.678
- FLAIR.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.451
- SURE, JAMES.

10:51.518 --> 10:53.787

10:53.854 --> 10:55.222
[all shouting at once]

10:55.288 --> 10:57.390
- THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN.

10:57.457 --> 10:58.859
IT'S NOT YOU, IT'S ME.

10:58.926 --> 11:00.427
THIS IS TOO MUCH!

11:00.493 --> 11:01.729
- WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU!

11:03.396 --> 11:05.365
- I LOVE YOU BOTH FOR CARING...

11:05.432 --> 11:06.867
BUT I AM PERFECTLY CAPABLE

11:06.934 --> 11:08.268
OF GETTING MY OWN DATE.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.469
[together] NO, YOU'RE NOT.

11:09.536 --> 11:10.904
- I'M FINE.

11:10.971 --> 11:13.640
- MOM, IT'S TIME TO PUT DOWN
THE ROMANCE NOVELS

11:13.741 --> 11:15.475
AND FIND SOME ROMANCE.

11:15.542 --> 11:16.643
- YOU'RE NOT GETTING
ANY YOUNGER.

11:18.545 --> 11:20.147
- FINE.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.815
YOU WANT TO GET ME A DATE?

11:21.882 --> 11:24.051
GET ME...

11:24.117 --> 11:25.418
HIM.

11:25.485 --> 11:27.087
BUT ONLY HIM.

11:27.154 --> 11:29.990
THIS IS THE MAN OF MY DREAMS,
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

11:30.057 --> 11:32.760
NOBODY ELSE.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.161
GOOD LUCK.

11:36.764 --> 11:37.998
- OKAY, LET'S GET HIM.

11:38.065 --> 11:38.966
- YOU GOT IT.

11:42.803 --> 11:45.172
- OKAY, SEARCH FOR "FABIO"
AND "FAKE BUTTER."

11:48.776 --> 11:50.077
- OH, NO.

11:50.143 --> 11:52.012
THIS GUY MOM WANTS TO DATE
IS SERIOUSLY FAMOUS.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.046
LOOK.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.347
- HEY!

11:54.414 --> 11:57.417
EVERYONE LOVES THE TASTE
OF FRESHLY GRILLED MEAT.

11:57.484 --> 12:00.020
BUT YOU CAN'T DRAG YOUR BARBECUE
AROUND WITH YOU EVERYWHERE.

12:00.087 --> 12:02.122
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, FABIO?

12:02.189 --> 12:03.456
- IT'S SUCH A HASSLE.

12:03.523 --> 12:04.424
LOOK.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.629
- THAT'S WHY THERE'S
THE FABIO POCKET GRILLER,

12:09.696 --> 12:12.532
WHICH GRILLS MEAT
ANY TIME, ANYWHERE.

12:12.599 --> 12:15.602
- AND MAKE YOU LOOK SEXY,
LIKE FABIO.

12:15.668 --> 12:18.171
- JUST PUT YOUR FAVORITE MEAT
IN YOUR POCKETS

12:18.238 --> 12:20.707
TWO HOURS BEFORE YOUR NEXT MEAL.

12:20.808 --> 12:21.942

12:38.191 --> 12:39.927

13:19.166 --> 13:20.233
OKAY, SO I--

14:52.259 --> 14:53.726
I'M LEAVING.

16:05.032 --> 16:06.833
YOU'RE NOT GONNA SCREAM, RIGHT?

16:06.899 --> 16:08.668

I SNAPPED EARLIER.

16:24.317 --> 16:27.520
I GUESS I AM A LITTLE SENSITIVE
ABOUT THE DATING THING.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.656
BUT I WANTED TO THANK YOU
