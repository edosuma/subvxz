THE AUTHORITY
TO AUTHORIZE,

DETENTION ALL WEEK

20:00.133 --> 20:01.834
I HAVE NO IDEA.

20:01.834 --> 20:04.567
BUT I DO KNOW
THAT I WON'T STAND BY

20:04.567 --> 20:06.233
AND LET YOU BEAT UP...

20:06.233 --> 20:09.734
SOMEBODY THAT I DON'T
EVEN KNOW AT ALL.

20:09.734 --> 20:12.000
O.K., O.K.
HE'S MY BROTHER.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
OH.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.667
THIS IS
YOUR BROTHER.

20:15.667 --> 20:17.367
DIDN'T HE JUST SAY THAT?

20:17.367 --> 20:20.667
DID NOT HE JUST SAY
I'M HIS BROTHER?

20:20.667 --> 20:21.700
JUST HOW STUPID--

20:21.700 --> 20:23.467
CORY, DON'T PROVOKE.

20:23.467 --> 20:24.700
WELL, HOW SWEET.

20:24.700 --> 20:28.734
A CHANCE TO WIPE OUT
THE WHOLE BABOON FAMILY.

20:28.734 --> 20:29.734
3:00, GUYS.

20:29.734 --> 20:33.400
GO HOME. WE GOT TO
HOSE THE PLACE DOWN.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.567
WHO ARE YOU?

20:34.567 --> 20:37.133
I'M YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE.
I'M A TEACHER.

20:37.133 --> 20:40.133
NO WONDER
I DON'T RECOGNIZE YOU.

20:40.133 --> 20:41.400
WHAT DO YOU TEACH?

20:41.400 --> 20:43.700
ENGLISH LIT
AND KICK BOXING.

20:43.700 --> 20:44.800
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

20:44.800 --> 20:46.233
NOTHING. WE'VE
WORKED IT OUT.

20:46.233 --> 20:51.400
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
ABOUT TO POUND THIS KID
INTO THE GROUND.

20:51.400 --> 20:52.867
THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR ME.

20:52.867 --> 20:56.700
IF ONE OF MY STUDENTS
GETS KILLED THE FIRST DAY,

20:56.700 --> 20:57.734
I LOOK BAD.

20:57.734 --> 21:01.133
PEOPLE START TO TALK,
I GET A REPUTATION,

21:01.133 --> 21:02.700
I'M CARELESS WITH STUDENTS.

21:02.700 --> 21:04.700
SO DO ME A FAVOR.

21:04.700 --> 21:06.800
DON'T KILL MY STUDENT.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.400
COULD I TAKE YOU?

21:10.400 --> 21:11.500
NAH.

21:11.500 --> 21:14.033
I COULD'VE
TAKEN THE KID, THOUGH.

21:14.033 --> 21:15.967
GOOD FOR YOU.

21:18.567 --> 21:22.900
SO, ODYSSEUS,
LOOKS LIKE YOU MAY
GET HOME SAFELY.

21:22.900 --> 21:24.600
THANKS, MR. TURNER.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.200
I'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW.

21:26.200 --> 21:27.934
READ THE BOOK.

21:27.934 --> 21:30.400
I LIVED IT.

21:31.834 --> 21:35.100
HEY, ERIC,
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

21:35.100 --> 21:36.700
WHAT DO WANT TO SAY?

21:36.700 --> 21:38.400
THANKS FOR BEING
MY BROTHER.

21:40.233 --> 21:42.200
DO I KNOW YOU?

21:44.900 --> 21:46.000
SHAWN.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.767
SHAWN,
YOU CAN COME OUT.

21:48.767 --> 21:49.834
THE FIGHT'S OVER.

21:49.834 --> 21:52.834
OUR HIGH SCHOOL
REPUTATIONS ARE SET.

21:52.834 --> 21:56.100
I'M STILL WORKING
ON MINE.

21:59.567 --> 22:01.834
BIG LOCKERS IN HIGH SCHOOL.

22:09.700 --> 22:11.133
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

22:11.133 --> 22:12.500
MOMS, DADS, AND WEASELS,

22:12.500 --> 22:17.200
I GIVE YOU THE MAN WHO SAID
HE DIDN'T HAVE A BROTHER,

22:17.200 --> 22:20.667
ERIC "THE GREAT ONE"
MATTHEWS.

22:20.667 --> 22:24.767
SOME GOON AT SCHOOL WAS
TRYING TO PICK ON CORY

22:24.767 --> 22:27.100
JUST BECAUSE
HE'S BIGGER THAN HIM.

22:27.100 --> 22:28.400
I HATE THAT.

22:28.400 --> 22:29.400
I HATE THAT, TOO.

22:29.400 --> 22:30.834
WHO ASKED YOU,
SPECK?

22:30.834 --> 22:33.500
HEY, I WAS
WATCHING THAT.

22:33.500 --> 22:36.000
HEY, DON'T
HIT THE KID.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.033
HEY, EVERYBODY BE QUIET!

22:38.033 --> 22:40.700
I'M TRYING TO WATCH TV!

22:44.200 --> 22:45.667
THAT'S POWER.
