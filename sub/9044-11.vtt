WEBVTT

00:01.933 --> 00:03.000
- HEY!

00:03.000 --> 00:04.400
HEY! HOW WAS THE GAME?

00:04.400 --> 00:06.667
- OH, IT WAS GOOD, YEAH.
KNICKS FINALLY WON.

00:06.667 --> 00:07.700
THE TWINS LOVED IT.

00:07.700 --> 00:10.233
OH, AND THEIR NEW BUDDY
CHRIS THERE--

00:10.233 --> 00:12.467
HE'S MY NEW FAVORITE
OF THEIR FRIENDS, YEAH.

00:12.467 --> 00:16.100
HELLO, CHRIS.
GOOD-BYE, SPENCER.

00:16.100 --> 00:18.067
- THAT'S GREAT.
SO WHERE ARE THE BOYS?

00:18.067 --> 00:21.133
- OH, THEY'RE GONNA HITCHHIKE
HOME FROM THE STRIP CLUB.

00:25.867 --> 00:29.300
NO, THEY TOOK CHRIS NEXT DOOR.
THEY'RE SHOOTIN' HOOPS.

00:29.300 --> 00:31.033
- WHO IS THIS CHRIS?
HAVE I MET HIM?

00:31.033 --> 00:33.567
- OH, HE'S ADORABLE.
HIS DAD WORKS AT THE SCHOOL.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.433
- OH, YEAH?
WHAT SUBJECT DOES HE TEACH?

00:35.433 --> 00:38.200
- HE'S NOT A TEACHER.
ACTUALLY, HE'S THE CUSTODIAN.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.233
- OH, REALLY?
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

00:40.233 --> 00:41.700
AH, THAT'S FUNNY.

00:41.700 --> 00:42.733
- WHY?

00:42.733 --> 00:44.267
- NO, NO, 'CAUSE, UH...

00:44.267 --> 00:46.300
WE WERE EATING PEANUTS,
AND I LOOKED DOWN,

00:46.300 --> 00:48.000
AND LITTLE CHRIS HAD
ALL THE SHELLS ON HIS LAP,

00:48.000 --> 00:50.400
AND I SAID, "HEY, CHRIS, YOU CAN
THROW THOSE ON THE FLOOR.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.067
THAT'S WHAT THEY PAY
THE JANITOR FOR."

00:52.067 --> 00:54.267
[all gasp]

00:54.267 --> 00:56.300
- OH, MY GOD!

00:56.300 --> 00:58.533
RAYMOND, HOW COULD YOU?

00:58.533 --> 00:59.700
- WHAT?

00:59.700 --> 01:01.300
- OH, MY GOD, RAY,
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

01:01.300 --> 01:03.633
THAT POOR BOY
MUST BE DEVASTATED.

01:03.633 --> 01:05.933
[all talking at once]

01:05.933 --> 01:07.200
- NO, NO!
WAIT A MINUTE!

01:07.200 --> 01:09.267
WAIT A MINUTE.
EVERYBODY CALM DOWN.

01:09.267 --> 01:10.633
I DIDN'T DEVASTATE ANYBODY.

01:10.633 --> 01:12.967
IT WAS TOTALLY FINE.
IT WAS A JOKE.

01:12.967 --> 01:15.967
THE KID LAUGHED, HE--HE
THREW HIS SHELLS ON THE FLOOR,

01:15.967 --> 01:17.167
AND THEN WE WATCHED THE GAME,

01:17.167 --> 01:19.300
AND WE ALL LIVED
HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

01:19.300 --> 01:22.133
- RAYMOND,
YOU'RE A LOVELY BOY.

01:22.133 --> 01:25.033
BUT THIS IS WHY SOMETIMES
WHEN YOU TALK,

01:25.033 --> 01:28.600
MY HEART GOES INTO MY THROAT.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.167
- I AGREE 100%, MA,

01:30.167 --> 01:33.033
EXCEPT FOR
THE "LOVELY BOY" PART.

01:33.033 --> 01:34.533
- I TRIED TO TEACH YOU.

01:34.533 --> 01:37.700
I MEAN, YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT WORDS CAN HURT PEOPLE.

01:37.700 --> 01:39.167
- THAT'S RIGHT, RAYMOND!

01:39.167 --> 01:42.233
- NO ONE'S TALKING
TO YOU, ROBERT.

01:43.900 --> 01:46.267
YOU'RE SUCH A BUSYBODY.

01:51.800 --> 01:53.367
- I'M TELLING YOU
THE KID WAS FINE.

01:53.367 --> 01:55.033
MOM'S OUT OF HER MIND.

01:55.033 --> 01:59.300
- YEAH, WELL BE THAT AS IT MAY,
YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN.

01:59.300 --> 02:01.967
MY HEART GOES OUT TO THE BOY.

02:01.967 --> 02:03.200
- WILL YOU STOP IT?

02:03.200 --> 02:04.867
I WAS JUST BEING FUNNY.

02:04.867 --> 02:06.633
- I BEG TO DIFFER.

02:06.633 --> 02:12.133
YOU SAY THINGS
THAT NOBODY LIKES.

02:12.133 --> 02:13.567
JUST LIKE THAT TIME
WITH YOUR PARENTS?

02:13.567 --> 02:15.633
- WHEN?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

02:15.633 --> 02:18.967
- WELL, REMEMBER HOW YOU SAW
THE LITTLE JESUS FIGURINE

02:18.967 --> 02:20.667
ON THEIR DASHBOARD?

02:20.667 --> 02:22.533
AND YOU SAID TO THEM,

02:22.533 --> 02:26.300
"I GUESS THIS MUST BE
A HARD CAR TO MAKE OUT IN?"

02:32.833 --> 02:35.033
- WELL, I MEAN...

02:35.033 --> 02:38.733
THE GUY'S LOOKING RIGHT AT YOU.

02:38.733 --> 02:41.900
- RAY, IT CAN'T ALWAYS BE
THE OTHER PERSON'S FAULT

02:41.900 --> 02:43.500
WHEN THEY DON'T GET YOU.

02:43.500 --> 02:45.067
- THIS THING WITH THE KID
WAS FUNNY!

02:45.067 --> 02:47.267
I'M TELLING YOU,
HE LAUGHED.

02:47.267 --> 02:48.300
- YEAH, YEAH.

02:48.300 --> 02:49.933
YOU SEE, IF HE LAUGHED,

02:49.933 --> 02:55.033
IT WAS THE UNEASY CHUCKLE
OF A TERRIFIED YOUNG CHILD

02:55.033 --> 02:57.067
HAVING TO SPEND THE AFTERNOON

02:57.067 --> 03:01.433
WITH A VERY MEAN
AND UNFUNNY MAN.

03:01.433 --> 03:03.533
- I BET WHEN YOU
MAKE OUT IN THE CAR,

03:03.533 --> 03:05.767
THE JESUS WEEPS.

03:08.667 --> 03:10.267
[door opens]

03:10.267 --> 03:13.633
- HI, KIDS!
HEY, CHRIS! HI!

03:13.633 --> 03:16.900
CHRIS, I WANT YOU TO MEET
THE BOYS' UNCLE ROBERT

03:16.900 --> 03:18.400
AND AUNT AMY.

03:18.400 --> 03:21.333
- [sympathetically]
HI, CHRIS.

03:25.200 --> 03:28.433
- [sympathetically]
HOW YA DOIN', BUDDY?

03:28.433 --> 03:29.633
- GOOD.

03:29.633 --> 03:32.733
- LET'S GO UPSTAIRS, YOU GUYS!
- YEAH!

03:32.733 --> 03:34.167
YOU GUYS GO HAVE FUN.

03:34.167 --> 03:35.867
I MEAN--I MEAN
GO HAVE MORE FUN,

03:35.867 --> 03:39.200
'CAUSE WE HAD A LOT OF FUN
TODAY, DIDN'T WE, GUYS?

03:40.967 --> 03:42.367
- OBVIOUSLY TRAUMATIZED.

03:42.367 --> 03:45.167
- OH! STOP IT, HUH?
LOOK AT HIM.

03:45.167 --> 03:47.267
- OH, HOW SOON YOU FORGET
YOUR OWN PAST, RAYMOND.

03:47.267 --> 03:48.767
HOW ABOUT ALL THE TIME

03:48.767 --> 03:51.733
WE HAD TO LAUGH AT DAD'S
HORRIBLE PUBERTY JOKES?

03:51.733 --> 03:53.000
- HE HAD TO MAKE JOKES.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
YOU WENT THROUGH PUBERTY
AT SIX.

03:57.167 --> 03:59.767
- YOU STOLE THAT LINE
FROM DAD!

03:59.767 --> 04:02.400
COME ON, AMY,
WE'RE GETTING THE PAPER

04:02.400 --> 04:07.033
AND MOVING FAR, FAR AWAY
FROM JACKASS LANE!

04:11.100 --> 04:13.300
- I'LL STILL VISIT.

04:17.367 --> 04:18.733
- WHAT?

04:18.733 --> 04:20.000
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.333
[doorbell rings]

04:21.333 --> 04:22.767
THINK I
DID SOMETHING WRONG,

04:22.767 --> 04:25.167
AND THEY GOT TO BRING JESUS
INTO IT, RIGHT?

04:27.933 --> 04:29.367
HEY.

04:29.367 --> 04:31.233
- HI, I'M CHRIS' DAD,
GEORGE BUCKNER.

04:31.233 --> 04:33.633
- OH! OH, HEY, I'M RAY.
I'M RAY. HOW YOU DOING?

04:33.633 --> 04:35.133
- HI, HI, HI! HI!

04:36.200 --> 04:37.533
COME ON IN.

04:37.533 --> 04:39.133
- I KNOW I'M A LITTLE EARLY,

04:39.133 --> 04:41.433
BUT I FIGURED YOU PROBABLY
HAD ENOUGH OF HIM.

04:41.433 --> 04:43.300
- OH, NEVER!
HE WAS A PLEASURE.

04:43.300 --> 04:45.300
IN FACT, WE'LL KEEP HIM.
- [laughs]

04:45.300 --> 04:47.667
- OKAY, BUT NO
GIVESIES-BACKSIES.

04:47.667 --> 04:49.300
[all chuckling]

04:49.300 --> 04:51.267
HEY, HOW WAS THE GAME?

04:51.267 --> 04:52.600
- OH, THEY HAD A BLAST, YEAH.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.233
- YEAH, IT WAS A REAL TREAT
FOR CHRIS.

04:54.233 --> 04:56.467
THIS WAS HIS FIRST KNICK GAME.
- YEAH, GOOD.

04:56.467 --> 04:58.667
- RAY, WHY DON'T YOU GO UP
AND TELL CHRIS HIS DAD IS HERE?

04:58.667 --> 04:59.867
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING?

04:59.867 --> 05:01.700
- NO, I'LL GET HIM
SOMETHING TO DRINK.

05:01.700 --> 05:02.633
YOU CAN GO UPSTAIRS, YEAH.

05:02.633 --> 05:04.533
YEAH, GO AHEAD.
IT'S OKAY.

05:04.533 --> 05:05.733
I CAN DO THINGS.

05:07.833 --> 05:09.767
YEAH. COME ON.
COME ON IN.

05:09.767 --> 05:11.900
- HEY, CAN I GIVE YOU
SOMETHING FOR TODAY?

05:11.900 --> 05:14.000
- OH, NO, NO, NO.
I GET THE TICKETS FOR FREE.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.300
- OH, IT'S OKAY, BUT I'VE BEEN
TO THE MOVIES WITH HIM,

05:16.300 --> 05:17.700
HE CAN EAT 40 BUCKS'
WORTH OF CANDY.

05:17.700 --> 05:22.200
- NO, WELL, CONSIDER
HIS STOMACHACHE MY GIFT.

05:22.200 --> 05:24.967
[both laughing]

05:24.967 --> 05:26.033
- THAT'S FUNNY.

05:26.033 --> 05:28.867
- YEAH.
YEAH, FUNNY, RIGHT?

05:28.867 --> 05:30.100
YEAH, YEAH.

05:31.800 --> 05:33.567
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS FUNNY?

05:33.567 --> 05:34.600
- NO.
- YEAH.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.233
YOU KNOW, UH, UH...

05:36.233 --> 05:38.533
AT ONE POINT,
CHRIS STARTED EATING PEANUTS,

05:38.533 --> 05:41.333
AND I LOOKED DOWN, AND HE'S NOT
THROWING THE SHELLS AWAY.

05:41.333 --> 05:42.667
HE'S GOT ALL OF THEM
ON HIS LAP.

05:42.667 --> 05:44.100
SO I JUST SAY TO HIM,

05:44.100 --> 05:45.600
"HEY, CHRIS, YOU CAN THROW THOSE
ON THE FLOOR.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.267
THAT'S WHAT THEY PAY
THE JANITOR FOR."

05:47.267 --> 05:48.900
[laughs]
YEAH, YEAH.

05:48.900 --> 05:51.200
AND THEN HE LAUGHED.
OH, HE KIND OF LAUGHED HARD.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.833
YEAH, AND THEN HE TOOK
HIS SHELLS--

05:52.833 --> 05:55.800
TOOK HIS SHELLS, AND HE PUT THEM
ON THE FLOOR REAL GENTLY.

05:55.800 --> 05:59.367
SO I GUESS YOU GOT HIM
TRAINED REALLY GOOD AT HOME.

05:59.367 --> 06:00.467
[laughs]

06:00.467 --> 06:02.767
UH, IT WAS JUST KIND OF A...

06:02.767 --> 06:04.767
A--A SIMPLE REMARK, YOU KNOW,

06:04.767 --> 06:07.233
A "HEY, THROW YOUR NUTS
ON THE FLOOR! HA-HA!" REMARK.

06:07.233 --> 06:09.000
YEAH...YEAH.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.333
IT WAS FUNNY.
IT WAS FUNNY.

06:10.333 --> 06:11.767
HE'S FUNNY--CHRIS.

06:13.867 --> 06:17.900
YOU KNOW, HE'S MY FAVORITE
FRIEND OF THE KIDS'.

06:17.900 --> 06:20.333
- OKAY.
- YEAH.

06:20.333 --> 06:22.433
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS FUNNY?

06:22.433 --> 06:25.000
I DIDN'T KNOW--I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT THAT WAS YOUR...

06:25.000 --> 06:27.367
THAT--THAT--THAT'S YOUR...

06:27.367 --> 06:29.367
CRAFT.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.300
- HI, DAD.
- HEY, BUDDY. LET'S GO.

06:34.300 --> 06:36.233
- LISTEN, CHRIS.
IT WAS GREAT HAVING YOU.

06:36.233 --> 06:37.467
WE'LL HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN
SOMETIME.

06:37.467 --> 06:38.900
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

06:38.900 --> 06:40.900
- AH, THAT'S A POLITE KID.
YEAH, YEAH.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.167
ANYTIME, CHRIS.

06:42.167 --> 06:43.533
TAKE IT EASY.

06:43.533 --> 06:46.533
YEAH, AND IT WAS
NICE MEETING YOU...

06:46.533 --> 06:47.933
MISTER!

06:47.933 --> 06:49.367
HUH?

06:49.367 --> 06:50.933
I'LL SEE YOU, CHRIS!

06:50.933 --> 06:54.767
YOU'RE MY NEW FAVORITE FRIEND
OF THE KIDS'!

07:03.933 --> 07:05.233
NEXT TIME BEFORE I TAKE
A KID TO A GAME,

07:05.233 --> 07:06.633
WOULD IT KILL YOU TO TELL ME

07:06.633 --> 07:08.433
WHAT HIS FATHER DOES
FOR A LIVING?

07:12.967 --> 07:15.267
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

07:20.833 --> 07:24.700
- EITHER I'M NOT TELLIN'
THAT CHRIS STORY PERFECTLY,

07:24.700 --> 07:28.600
OR...OR HIS FATHER'S
A LITTLE SENSITIVE.

07:29.533 --> 07:32.000
- YOU TOLD HIM WHAT YOU SAID?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.900
WHY THE HELL
WOULD YOU DO THAT?

07:33.900 --> 07:37.300
- TO SHOW--TO SHOW YOU
THAT IT'S JUST A FUNNY STORY

07:37.300 --> 07:39.033
AND THAT ANYBODY
WOULD BE FINE WITH IT.

07:39.033 --> 07:40.633
- AND IS HE FINE WITH IT?

07:44.167 --> 07:45.933
- NOT ALWAYS RIGHT!

07:45.933 --> 07:49.300
- GOD, RAY, I WAS WORRIED
THAT CHRIS WOULD TELL HIM.

07:49.300 --> 07:54.100
I NEVER THOUGHT THAT YOU
WOULD GO AND COMMIT HARI-KARI!

07:54.100 --> 07:56.100
- WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN
ANYTHING BY IT.

07:56.100 --> 07:58.867
HE'S SENSITIVE. YOU'D THINK
A JANITOR WOULD BE TOUGHER.

07:58.867 --> 08:00.900
- STOP! STOP! STOP!

08:00.900 --> 08:02.833
STOP SAYING THAT!

08:02.833 --> 08:05.400
LISTEN, YOU HAVE TO REALIZE
YOU SAID A HORRIBLE THING,

08:05.400 --> 08:08.233
AND YOU ARE NOT A FUNNY PERSON!

08:12.000 --> 08:13.567
- I KNOW!

08:17.667 --> 08:19.200
- GOOD! GOOD!

08:19.200 --> 08:21.233
WHEN YOU TAKE THE KIDS
TO SCHOOL TOMORROW,

08:21.233 --> 08:23.300
YOU'LL GO DOWN
TO THAT FURNACE ROOM

08:23.300 --> 08:26.700
AND APOLOGIZE TO CHRIS' DAD.

08:26.700 --> 08:28.233
- ALL RIGHT.

08:28.233 --> 08:29.667
[doorbell rings]
- JEEZ.

08:33.767 --> 08:35.033
HI!

08:35.033 --> 08:37.567
- I THINK CHRIS
LEFT HIS RETAINER HERE.

08:37.567 --> 08:39.533
- OH, YOU KNOW,
I'M SURE IT'S UPSTAIRS.

08:39.533 --> 08:40.533
GO ON UP, CHRIS.

08:40.533 --> 08:43.167
COME ON IN. COME.
COME IN.

08:43.167 --> 08:44.800
CAN I--CAN I
GET YOU SOMETHING?

08:44.800 --> 08:46.700
MAYBE, UH, SOME GINGER ALE

08:46.700 --> 08:48.533
OR PRETZELS?

08:48.533 --> 08:49.600
- NO, THANKS.

08:53.833 --> 08:55.167
- LISTEN...

08:55.167 --> 08:57.200
I HOPE YOU DIDN'T
GET UPSET OR...

08:57.200 --> 08:58.900
OR...OR ANGRY

08:58.900 --> 09:01.067
ABOUT THE THING
I SAID BEFORE

09:01.067 --> 09:04.367
ABOUT THE THING I SAID...
AT THE GAME.

09:04.367 --> 09:06.133
- LET'S JUST FORGET IT.

09:06.133 --> 09:07.767
- 'CAUSE HE WOULD NEVER
SAY ANYTHING

09:07.767 --> 09:10.367
TO HURT YOURS OR CHRIS'
OR ANYBODY'S FEELINGS.

09:10.367 --> 09:13.033
- HEY, I'M DOING IT!

09:19.833 --> 09:21.300
- IT'S OKAY.

09:21.300 --> 09:22.833
- NO, IT'S NOT OKAY.
IT'S NOT.

09:22.833 --> 09:24.233
COME HERE. COME HERE.

09:24.233 --> 09:25.667
JUST--PLEASE,
JUST SIT DOWN FOR ONE MINUTE.

09:25.667 --> 09:27.367
ONE MINUTE, PLEASE.
NO, GO AHEAD.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.900
GO AHEAD. GO AHEAD.
JUST--JUST SIT DOWN, PLEASE.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.567
PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE.

09:31.567 --> 09:33.000
YOU KNOW...

09:33.000 --> 09:35.067
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

09:35.067 --> 09:36.867
I--I WASN'T THINKIN'.

09:36.867 --> 09:40.300
SO--SO I'M SORRY THAT
I WAS A LITTLE INSENSITIVE.

09:40.300 --> 09:41.800
I THINK MAYBE I SAID
WHAT I SAID

09:41.800 --> 09:44.300
BECAUSE I'M NOT, YOU KNOW,
A JANITOR.

09:48.733 --> 09:50.767
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,

09:50.767 --> 09:52.800
WE PREFER THE TERM "CUSTODIAN."

09:52.800 --> 09:54.267
- CUSTODIAN! RIGHT.

09:54.267 --> 09:56.967
CUSTODIAN!
I MEANT CUSTODIAN.

09:56.967 --> 09:59.167
- I ALWAYS SAY CUSTODIAN.

09:59.167 --> 10:02.300
- I'VE SAID CUSTODIAN!

10:02.300 --> 10:04.900
- IT--IT'S OKAY, REALLY.
I--I'D BETTER GET GOING.

10:04.900 --> 10:06.433
- NO, NO, NO, NO!

10:06.433 --> 10:08.067
NOW I FEEL LIKE
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO GO.

10:08.067 --> 10:09.467
BUT PLEASE.
I'M NOT LIKE THAT.

10:09.467 --> 10:11.100
- I KNOW.
- NO, NO. PLEASE, WAIT. WAIT.

10:11.100 --> 10:14.167
- RAY, LET HIM GO!
I'M SORRY, GEORGE.

10:14.167 --> 10:16.700
- HEY, DON'T APOLOGIZE
FOR ME!

10:16.700 --> 10:19.333
- HEY, CAN I USE YOUR PHONE
TO CALL REAL ESTATE AGENTS?

10:19.333 --> 10:20.800
- YEAH, YEAH, SURE.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.633
- EVERY TIME I TRY TO CALL ONE
FROM OVER THERE,

10:22.633 --> 10:24.733
I HEAR MOM BREATHING
ON THE UPSTAIRS LINE.

10:27.033 --> 10:28.433
- HEY, ROBERT, ROBERT!

10:28.433 --> 10:30.167
YOU REMEMBER THE TWINS'
WONDERFUL FRIEND CHRIS?

10:30.167 --> 10:31.933
WELL, THIS IS HIS
WONDERFUL DAD, GEORGE.

10:31.933 --> 10:34.133
- OH.

10:34.133 --> 10:37.267
- I THINK CHRIS IS WONDERFUL.

10:38.667 --> 10:41.233
A SPLENDID LAD.

10:42.900 --> 10:44.300
- THIS IS MY BROTHER,
ROBERT.

10:44.300 --> 10:46.233
YEAH. HE'S A COP.

10:46.233 --> 10:49.067
HE'S A COP,
JUST A REGULAR COP.

10:49.067 --> 10:50.567
WORKIN' JOE.

10:52.700 --> 10:54.167
MY BROTHER.

10:56.167 --> 10:57.700
[all chattering]

10:57.700 --> 10:59.933
- HEY, YOU READY, CHRIS?
YOU GOT YOUR RETAINER?

10:59.933 --> 11:02.067
- NOT YET. WE'RE GONNA GO PLAY
ON THE COMPUTER.

11:02.067 --> 11:04.367
- YEAH, BUT WE
REALLY HAVE TO--

11:04.367 --> 11:05.500
GREAT.

11:10.200 --> 11:11.667
- LET HIM STAY, YOU KNOW?

11:11.667 --> 11:13.500
HE SHOULD STAY.
THEY'RE HAVING A FANTASTIC TIME.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.333
IN FACT, THIS IS BETTER,
'CAUSE YOU GUYS

11:15.333 --> 11:17.400
CAN JUST SIT DOWN AND GET
TO KNOW EACH OTHER BETTER.

11:17.400 --> 11:19.567
YEAH, YEAH.
JUST SIT. SIT. SIT. SIT.

11:19.567 --> 11:20.667
SIT! SIT!

11:20.667 --> 11:23.067
SIT!

11:23.067 --> 11:25.200
SIT...DOWN! DOWN!

11:25.200 --> 11:26.600
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:26.600 --> 11:28.167
- NO, THEY HAVE A LOT IN COMMON,
THESE GUYS.

11:28.167 --> 11:30.967
- WE DO?
- SURE! SURE.

11:30.967 --> 11:33.500
I JUST THINK
IT'S SO INTERESTING, YOU KNOW?

11:33.500 --> 11:36.000
ONE OF YOU
KEEPS THE SCHOOLS CLEAN,

11:36.000 --> 11:38.667
AND ONE OF YOU
KEEPS THE STREETS CLEAN.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.233
YOU KNOW?

11:47.133 --> 11:49.033
METAPHORICALLY.

11:49.033 --> 11:51.200
BUT THE MAIN THING IS...

11:51.200 --> 11:53.700
SHOULD ONE OF YOU
START TO SLACK OFF...

11:53.700 --> 11:54.967
WOW!

11:54.967 --> 11:57.133
THERE'S A MESS!

11:58.767 --> 12:00.867
- RAY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:00.867 --> 12:04.300
- I'M TALKIN'
TO THE BACKBONE OF AMERICA.

12:06.933 --> 12:08.267
- YOU HAVE TO STOP!

12:08.267 --> 12:11.933
GEORGE, RAY IS SORRY
FOR HIS FAUX PAS,

12:11.933 --> 12:14.333
AND I'M SORRY
FOR ALL OF THIS.

12:14.333 --> 12:15.867
- "FAUX PAS! FAUX PAS!"

12:15.867 --> 12:18.000
OH, YOU'RE SO MUCH BETTER
THAN ME, RIGHT?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.300
- THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME!

12:19.300 --> 12:20.467
- I KNOW,
SO STAY OUT OF IT!

12:20.467 --> 12:22.000
I DON'T GO APOLOGIZING
FOR YOU

12:22.000 --> 12:24.167
WHEN YOU DO
ONE OF YOUR FAUX PAS!

12:24.167 --> 12:25.567
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:25.567 --> 12:27.333
NEXT TIME
I MAKE A FAUX PAS LIKE YOU,

12:27.333 --> 12:28.667
PLEASE SAY SOMETHING!

12:28.667 --> 12:29.733
- I WILL.
I WILL.

12:29.733 --> 12:31.533
- CHRIS!

12:35.967 --> 12:37.567
[kids chattering]

12:37.567 --> 12:39.533
GO GET YOUR RETAINER.
YOU GOT TO STOP TAKING IT OUT!

12:47.933 --> 12:49.567
- ROBERT,
PUT THAT PHONE DOWN.

12:53.067 --> 12:55.167
OH, HELLO.

12:55.167 --> 12:58.033
- MARIE,
THIS IS OUR FRIEND GEORGE,

12:58.033 --> 12:59.433
CHRIS' DAD.

12:59.433 --> 13:00.833
THIS IS RAY'S MOM, MARIE.

13:00.833 --> 13:02.033
- HI.

13:03.133 --> 13:04.900
- WAIT. YOU'RE THE JANITOR?

13:04.900 --> 13:07.300
- CUSTODIAN.
CUSTODIAN.

13:07.300 --> 13:09.567
- OH...
CAUSE I THOUGHT--

13:09.567 --> 13:11.533
- MARIE, WHAT'S THE STORY
WITH THE CANNELLONI?

13:11.533 --> 13:13.333
- IT'S READY.
LET'S GO.

13:13.333 --> 13:14.967
- WHO'S THIS?

13:14.967 --> 13:17.033
- THIS IS CHRIS' DAD,
GEORGE.

13:17.033 --> 13:18.467
- THE JANITOR?

13:21.900 --> 13:23.833
MARIE, YOU SAID
HE WAS BLACK!

13:23.833 --> 13:26.367
[all gasp]

13:28.533 --> 13:29.700
- NO, I DIDN'T!

13:29.700 --> 13:31.233
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
YOU SAID--

13:31.233 --> 13:33.100
- NO, I SAID HE WAS
AFRICAN-AMERICAN!

13:33.100 --> 13:34.733
[all groan]

13:34.733 --> 13:37.833
- OKAY, THEN.
WHAT ARE YOU ARGUING FOR?

13:37.833 --> 13:39.300
- I APOLOGIZE, GEORGE.

13:39.300 --> 13:40.633
IT'S JUST, WELL--

13:40.633 --> 13:43.100
I--YOU KNOW,
I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL

13:43.100 --> 13:46.367
THAT ANYONE
CAN BE A JANITOR NOW.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.433
- GEORGE, PLEASE...

13:52.433 --> 13:54.200
- NO, IT'S OKAY.
I--I REALLY HAVE TO GO.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.800
- I WANT TO ASSURE YOU

13:55.800 --> 13:58.100
THAT MARIE DOES NOT SPEAK
FOR ALL OF US.

13:58.100 --> 13:59.667
- SHE JUST SPEAKS MORE
THAN ALL OF US.

13:59.667 --> 14:03.300
WHO ARE YOU TO TALK?
YOU CAME IN SAYING, "BLACK"!

14:03.300 --> 14:05.400
- OH, MY GOD!
- OH, JEEZ!

14:05.400 --> 14:07.833
- GEORGE, LISTEN, I--

14:07.833 --> 14:10.867
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO LIVE WITH THIS MAN.

14:10.867 --> 14:15.267
I MEAN, HE--HE'S
A CONSTANT EMBARRASSMENT.

14:15.267 --> 14:18.233
- I'M JUST WAITIN'
FOR A RETAINER.

14:22.567 --> 14:25.033
- WHAT ABOUT THE TIME YOU WORKED
FOR THE PELK ACCOUNTING?

14:25.033 --> 14:27.233
- OH, YEAH, THAT WAS FUNNY.
YEAH.

14:27.233 --> 14:28.467
HEY, I WALK INTO WORK
ONE MORNING,

14:28.467 --> 14:30.533
AND THERE'S THIS
HUGE LADY SITTING

14:30.533 --> 14:33.267
AT ONE OF THE OTHER GUYS' DESK,
WORKING THE PHONES.

14:33.267 --> 14:35.733
SO I GO OVER TO IRV LEBROTTE,
AND I SAY,

14:35.733 --> 14:40.067
"HEY, WHO'S THAT
BIG, FAT MOOSE OVER THERE?"

14:41.767 --> 14:43.667
HE SMILES AT ME AND SAYS,

14:43.667 --> 14:46.433
"THAT'S MY MOM."

14:46.433 --> 14:49.633
- OH, MY GOD, FRANK,
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

14:49.633 --> 14:51.567
- WELL, I WAS PRETTY QUICK
ON MY FEET BACK THEN,

14:51.567 --> 14:54.400
SO I SAID, UH,
"WHAT DO YOU FEED HER?"

15:03.967 --> 15:08.000
AND I WALKED AWAY.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.867
- YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE, FRANK!

15:09.867 --> 15:11.533
WHENEVER I TAKE HIM ANYWHERE,

15:11.533 --> 15:14.300
I WANT TO GIVE OUT CARDS
THAT SAY, "I'M SORRY," ON THEM.

15:16.167 --> 15:19.133
- MY CARDS SAY,
"WIFE FOR SALE."

15:20.267 --> 15:23.367
PHONE AIN'T RINGIN'.

15:25.167 --> 15:26.767
- ALL RIGHT,
WILL YOU TWO STOP?

15:26.767 --> 15:28.767
THIS IS WHY EVERYBODY THINKS
THAT OUR FAMILY IS CRAZY!

15:28.767 --> 15:31.233
IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU TWO
AND RAYMOND!

15:33.733 --> 15:35.733
- HOW DARE YOU,

15:35.733 --> 15:39.067
TALKING ABOUT OUR FAMILY
IN FRONT OF COMPANY?

15:39.067 --> 15:41.067
I APOLOGIZE FOR MY SON.

15:41.067 --> 15:43.200
- OH, DON'T APOLOGIZE FOR ME!

15:43.200 --> 15:45.667
YOU CAME IN HERE
WITH THE BIGGEST FAUX PAS EVER,

15:45.667 --> 15:47.600
NOT ME!
- OH, YEAH?

15:47.600 --> 15:49.833
WELL, HOW ABOUT THE TIME
THAT YOU ARRESTED THE GUY

15:49.833 --> 15:52.300
FOR FLASHING GANG SIGNS, HUH?

15:52.300 --> 15:54.367
AND YOU STARTED READING HIM
HIS RIGHTS,

15:54.367 --> 15:56.767
BUT HE JUST KEPT
FLASHING GANG SIGNS,

15:56.767 --> 15:58.700
MAKING YOU MADDER AND MADDER.

16:00.400 --> 16:04.500
HE WASN'T BREAKIN' THE LAW,
WAS HE, ROBERT?

16:07.600 --> 16:09.167
- NO.

16:10.167 --> 16:13.067
- WHAT WAS HE DOIN'?

16:13.067 --> 16:16.200
- HE WAS BEING DEAF.

16:18.067 --> 16:21.000
[laughter]

16:24.900 --> 16:27.200
- HOLY CRAP!

16:28.967 --> 16:32.467
- FEE-FI-FAUX-PAS!

16:36.967 --> 16:38.833
- OH, GOD...

16:38.833 --> 16:40.800
I STILL REMEMBER.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.867
I'M SO, SO...

16:43.867 --> 16:45.767
SORRY.

16:47.767 --> 16:49.333
- YEAH.

16:49.333 --> 16:51.500
THAT'S WORSE THAN WHAT I DID,
RIGHT, GEORGE?

16:51.500 --> 16:53.700
- NO, NO, RAY,
IT IS NOT WORSE,

16:53.700 --> 16:56.600
BECAUSE AT LEAST HE APOLOGIZED
AND THEN LEFT IT AT THAT.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.433
YOU'VE GONE ON TO MAKE THIS
EVEN MORE HUMILIATING

16:58.433 --> 16:59.867
BY WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

16:59.867 --> 17:00.833
- WHY? WHAT?
WHAT AM I DOING?

17:00.833 --> 17:02.733
WHAT?
GEORGE, WHAT?

17:02.733 --> 17:05.567
- YOU SAY THAT HORRIBLE THING
TO POOR LITTLE CHRIS,

17:05.567 --> 17:07.667
AND THEN YOU GO AND SAY
THE EXACT SAME THING

17:07.667 --> 17:09.667
TO THE MAN HIMSELF!

17:09.667 --> 17:12.267
AND THEN YOU INVITE
YOUR WHOLE FAMILY IN,

17:12.267 --> 17:15.633
THE FLYING FAUX PAS!

17:22.133 --> 17:26.000
WHO TREAT HIM TO AN AFTERNOON
OF INSULTS!

17:26.000 --> 17:28.167
- ALL RIGHT!
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

17:28.167 --> 17:30.133
I'M SORRY.
GEORGE, GEORGE.

17:30.133 --> 17:32.067
I SAID SOMETHING STUPID,
AND I'M SORRY.

17:32.067 --> 17:35.867
I AM.
I'M VERY, VERY SORRY.

17:35.867 --> 17:37.500
- HEY, IT'S OKAY, MAN.

17:37.500 --> 17:40.800
LET'S--LET'S REALLY
JUST FORGET ABOUT IT.

17:40.800 --> 17:43.033
PLEASE?

17:43.033 --> 17:44.567
- THANK YOU, GEORGE.

17:44.567 --> 17:47.033
NOW, RAY, GO UPSTAIRS
AND HELP CHRIS FIND HIS RETAINER

17:47.033 --> 17:49.433
SO GEORGE CAN
GET OUT OF HERE.

17:49.433 --> 17:50.500
- OKAY.

17:55.333 --> 17:57.767
- BUT I'VE BEEN THINKIN'
OF SOMETHIN', THOUGH...

17:59.033 --> 18:01.700
NO. NO, NO, NO.

18:01.700 --> 18:03.767
BECAUSE MAYBE, YES,

18:03.767 --> 18:07.367
IT--IT SEEMS
I WAS A LITTLE INSENSITIVE.

18:07.367 --> 18:10.533
BUT ACTUALLY,
THAT THING AT THE GAME TODAY--

18:10.533 --> 18:12.467
"HEY, YOU CAN THROW
YOUR SHELLS ON THE FLOOR.

18:12.467 --> 18:14.500
THAT'S WHAT THEY PAY
THE JANITOR FOR."

18:14.500 --> 18:17.267
I WAS JUST
STATING A FACT, RIGHT?

18:17.267 --> 18:19.467
I MEAN, IT'S TRUE,
ISN'T IT?

18:19.467 --> 18:20.900
IT'S LIKE THIS.
IT'S LIKE THIS.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.500
I'M A SPORTSWRITER, RIGHT?

18:22.500 --> 18:24.900
SO THE NEXT TIME
YOU'RE CLEANING UP SOMETHING

18:24.900 --> 18:26.067
AND YOUR KIDS ARE WITH YOU

18:26.067 --> 18:29.967
AND A SPORTING EVENT GOES BY

18:29.967 --> 18:33.667
AND ONE OF YOUR KIDS SAYS, "HEY,
I SHOULD WRITE ABOUT THAT,"

18:33.667 --> 18:36.967
WELL, THEN YOU CAN SAY,
"NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

18:36.967 --> 18:41.767
THAT'S WHAT THEY PAY
THE SPORTSWRITER FOR."

18:44.300 --> 18:46.700
YOU SEE?
IT'S THE SAME THING.

18:46.700 --> 18:49.433
SPORTSWRITER, JANITOR.

18:50.533 --> 18:52.267
CUSTODIAN.

18:53.933 --> 18:56.100
I'M VERY SORRY!

18:58.533 --> 18:59.467
- CHRIS!

19:00.833 --> 19:02.700
- I CAN'T FIND IT!

19:02.700 --> 19:05.033
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
YOUR TEETH ARE STRAIGHT ENOUGH!

19:08.300 --> 19:09.933
- I HOPE YOU'RE ALL HAPPY.

19:09.933 --> 19:13.500
LISTEN, GEORGE,
GEORGE...

19:13.500 --> 19:17.000
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.867
AND I JUST HOPE THAT THE
CHILDREN CAN STILL BE FRIENDS,

19:20.867 --> 19:22.933
BECAUSE THAT'S
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING,

19:22.933 --> 19:27.300
EVEN IF THE PARENTS CAN'T
FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET ALONG.

19:29.700 --> 19:31.033
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:31.033 --> 19:32.767
THANK YOU.

19:32.767 --> 19:34.433
- GREAT, GREAT.

19:34.433 --> 19:38.067
I JUST WANT MY KIDS
TO BE FRIENDS WITH EVERYBODY.

19:38.067 --> 19:39.100
I MEAN, WHO KNOWS?

19:39.100 --> 19:40.500
TOMORROW THEY MIGHT COME HOME

19:40.500 --> 19:42.433
WITH SOME BOY WHOSE DAD
WORKS IN THE SEWER.

19:42.433 --> 19:44.800
[all gasp]

19:44.800 --> 19:46.300
NO--I--UH...

19:46.300 --> 19:48.233
I DIDN'T--

19:50.167 --> 19:52.333
I'M SORRY.

20:01.900 --> 20:03.433
- DEBRA!

20:12.367 --> 20:14.533
- I FOUND IT.
IT WAS IN THE FISH TANK.

20:14.533 --> 20:16.633
- OH. PUT IT IN,
AND LET'S GO.

20:21.300 --> 20:23.300
THANKS AGAIN
FOR THE BALL GAME.

20:23.300 --> 20:25.567
- OKAY. THANK YOU.

20:32.500 --> 20:35.433
- WELL, WE'RE NEVER
GONNA SEE THEM AGAIN.

20:36.700 --> 20:38.767
- NO, I THINK
HE'LL BE BACK.

20:38.767 --> 20:40.767
HE FORGOT HIS KEYS.

20:49.267 --> 20:51.733
- I JUST
FEEL HORRIBLE.

20:51.733 --> 20:55.233
FOR A CUSTODIAN
TO SEE ALL THIS MESS.

21:01.567 --> 21:03.633
I THINK I'LL STRAIGHTEN UP.

21:07.667 --> 21:08.900
- HEY.

21:08.900 --> 21:10.167
CHRIS AND HIS DAD
ARE OUTSIDE,

21:10.167 --> 21:11.900
AND HE ASKED ME
TO GET HIS KEYS FOR HIM.

21:11.900 --> 21:16.367
IT SEEMED LIKE HE DIDN'T
WANT TO COME BACK INSIDE.

21:16.367 --> 21:19.867
- I DON'T BLAME HIM.
IT WAS KIND OF A NIGHTMARE.

21:19.867 --> 21:21.633
- OH, YEAH?

21:21.633 --> 21:24.567
DID YOUR MOTHER COME OVER
AND MAKE THINGS WORSE AS USUAL?

21:34.700 --> 21:36.633
[door clicks shut]
