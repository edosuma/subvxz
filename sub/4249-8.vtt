11:11.545 --> 11:12.713
- OH, SO THEN YOU WILL WANT

11:12.797 --> 11:14.382
TO DO EVERYTHING
YOU CAN TO KEEP HIM SAFE.

11:14.465 --> 11:16.217
WON'T YOU?

11:16.300 --> 11:16.759
- ARE YOU THREATENING ME?

11:16.842 --> 11:18.761
- JUST DO IT!

11:24.600 --> 11:26.435
- YUMMY WAFFLE.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.770
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

11:27.853 --> 11:28.437
- WELL, THE TIME DIFFERENCE--

11:28.521 --> 11:31.482
- ALFIE, HOW LONG THEN?

11:31.565 --> 11:32.566
UM--

11:43.702 --> 11:45.204
- WOULD YOU LIKE SOME O.J.?

11:45.287 --> 11:46.038
- FINALLY, SOMEONE
THAT SPEAKS ENGLISH.

11:46.122 --> 11:48.749
- [laughs]

11:48.833 --> 11:50.000
YOU'RE THE BEST THING I'VE HEARD
SINCE I'VE GOTTEN HERE.

11:50.084 --> 11:51.085
- OH-HO.

11:51.168 --> 11:53.462
- [choking]

11:53.546 --> 11:54.755
WHEN DID YOU GET HERE?

11:54.839 --> 11:56.507
I GOT A SHOCK WHEN I WOKE UP
THIS MORNING

11:56.590 --> 11:57.591
AND SAW YOU IN MICK'S BED.

11:57.675 --> 11:57.716
- I CAN IMAGINE.

12:00.302 --> 12:01.178
- YESTERDAY.

12:01.262 --> 12:02.263
I ONLY HAD THE PLEASURE OF
MEETING

12:02.346 --> 12:04.849
YAKKER HERE.

12:04.932 --> 12:07.184
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
WHO DO WE HAVE HERE?

12:07.268 --> 12:09.311
- AMBER.
- JOY.

12:09.395 --> 12:10.479
- HEY, I'M EDDIE.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.649
NOBODY TOLD ME ENGLISH GIRLS
WERE SO CUTE.

12:13.732 --> 12:14.650
- OH, YOU.

12:14.733 --> 12:15.651
- OH, PLEASE.

12:15.734 --> 12:17.903
- THERE YOU GO, DEAR.

12:20.239 --> 12:23.826
- SO WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE
SCHOOLS, EDDIE?

12:23.909 --> 12:25.035
- OH, LET'S SEE.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.162
[sighs]

12:26.245 --> 12:27.455
WELL, I GOT INTO SOME FIGHTS

12:27.538 --> 12:29.582
AND THEN, YOU KNOW,
FLUNKED MY CLASSES.

12:29.665 --> 12:31.792
AND THEN THE PRINCIPLE
HATED ME

12:31.876 --> 12:32.501
BECAUSE I SAID HIS DAUGHTER
WAS CUTE.

12:32.585 --> 12:35.504
BUT SHE TOTALLY WAS.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.465
- CAN YOU HAVE DONE A FAVE

12:37.548 --> 12:39.175
AND GONE TO ANOTHER SCHOOL
IN THE STATES?

12:39.258 --> 12:40.676
- TRICIA.

12:40.759 --> 12:42.261
- SURE KNOWS HOW TO MAKE A GUY
FEEL WELCOME.

12:43.471 --> 12:47.141
- [mouthing words]

12:47.224 --> 12:49.810
- WELL.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.854
- NINA.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.398
- YOU WANT TO GRAB SOME STUDY
BUDDY TIME AFTER LUNCH?

12:55.232 --> 12:57.276
- HUH?

12:57.359 --> 13:00.362
- SO YOU AND NINA,

13:00.446 --> 13:04.700
IT'S DEFINITELY OVER THEN?

13:04.783 --> 13:05.659
- IT LOOKS THAT WAY.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.703
- OKAY, FORGET THE STUDY STUFF.

13:07.786 --> 13:10.372
I SEE A BUDDY
NEEDING CHEERING UP.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.208
[chuckles]

13:12.291 --> 13:13.042
- WE COULD TAKE A TRIP
TO THE MOVIES.

13:13.125 --> 13:14.710
THERE'S A SHIA LABEOUF MARATHON.

13:14.793 --> 13:15.961
IT COULD BE JUST WHAT YOU NEED.

13:16.045 --> 13:18.964
- I DON'T THINK I CAN.

13:19.048 --> 13:19.924
NOT YET.

13:20.007 --> 13:21.342
- OH, COME ON.

13:21.425 --> 13:23.385
DON'T BE A STUDY BUDDY
FUDDY-DUDDY.

13:23.469 --> 13:26.055
- I'M SORRY, JOY.

13:26.138 --> 13:28.182
I GOT TO GO.

13:28.265 --> 13:29.558
CATCH YOU LATER.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.228
- OKAY, SO RAIN CHECK THEN,
YEAH?

13:33.646 --> 13:35.773
- AH, EDDERSON.
HELLO.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.691
I TRUST YOU SLEPT WELL.

13:37.775 --> 13:39.944
- LIKE A LOG.

13:40.027 --> 13:41.278
MY FRIENDS CALL ME EDDIE.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.280
- DON'T SPEAK TO ME
WITH YOUR MOUTH FULL.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.241
SHOW SOME RESPECT.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.451
- YOU CAN STICK WITH EDDERSON.

13:47.535 --> 13:50.037
- YOU WERE OUT UNTIL
AFTER 10:00 LAST NIGHT.

13:50.120 --> 13:52.289
PLEASE EXPLAIN.

13:52.373 --> 13:55.709
- WELL, VICTOR,

13:55.793 --> 13:59.380
I WAS OUT WITH MY RELATIVES.

13:59.463 --> 14:01.006
DIDN'T THINK I NEEDED
PERMISSION.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.758
- WELL, YOU DO.

14:02.841 --> 14:04.635
IN FUTURE, PLEASE GET IT.

14:04.718 --> 14:07.221
YOU WILL FIND YOUR STAY HERE
IS A LOT MORE PLEASANT

14:07.304 --> 14:10.349
IF YOU OBSERVE THE FEW
BASIC RULES.

14:11.976 --> 14:14.853
RUN ALONG.
NOTHING TO SEE HERE.

14:21.735 --> 14:25.239
- SO IS EVERYONE SIGNED UP
FOR A DONKEY DAY CHALLENGE?

14:25.322 --> 14:29.118
PATRICIA, I CAN'T SEE
YOUR NAME DOWN.

14:29.201 --> 14:31.579
THINK OF THOSE POOR
DISADVANTAGED DONKEYS.

14:31.662 --> 14:33.205
- GO ON.

14:33.289 --> 14:35.124
- OKAY.

14:35.207 --> 14:36.292
SIGN ME UP FOR THE WONKY DONKEY.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.085
- IT'S A FIVER ENTRANCE FEE,
PLEASE.

14:38.168 --> 14:40.379
- UH, WHAT'S THE WONKY DONKEY?

14:42.965 --> 14:44.633
- UH, THAT IS.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.052
- OH, ALFIE.
BABY STEPS.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.053
- HEY, YOU TWO.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.471
DONKEY DAY ISN'T UNTIL TOMORROW.

14:49.555 --> 14:52.975
- WE'RE SHOWING EVERYBODY
HOW IT'S DONE.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.019
- SINCE WHEN DID YOU BECOME
SO INTERESTED

14:55.102 --> 14:57.354
IN THE WELFARE
OF DONKEYS, JEROME?

14:57.438 --> 14:59.648
- EVER SINCE SUMMER BREAK
WHEN I WAS EIGHT.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.234
I SAW A DONKEY ON THE BEACH
BEING RIDDEN

15:02.318 --> 15:04.528
BY A SUMO WRESTLER.

15:04.612 --> 15:05.404
- [laughs]

15:05.487 --> 15:06.655
- I CAN'T GET IT OUT OF MY HEAD.

15:06.739 --> 15:07.823
I PROMISED MYSELF,

15:07.906 --> 15:12.286
ONE DAY I WOULD SAVE HIS PEOPLE.

15:12.369 --> 15:15.998
- SOMETHING DOESN'T SMELL RIGHT.

15:16.081 --> 15:16.123
- ALFIE'S SOCKS?

15:20.294 --> 15:21.503
- HEY, NEW BOY.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.422
CAN I PUT YOUR NAME DOWN
FOR A DONKEY DAY CHALLENGE?

15:23.505 --> 15:24.465
- [scoffs]

15:24.548 --> 15:26.508
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

15:26.592 --> 15:27.676
I SEE YOU HASSLING
EVERYBODY ELSE

15:27.760 --> 15:28.719
BUT NOT DOING A LOT YOURSELF.

15:28.802 --> 15:30.679
- HE HAS GOT A POINT, JEROME.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.014
- WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?

15:32.097 --> 15:33.390
- I'LL AGREE TO DO
A DONKEY CHALLENGE IF YOU DO.

15:33.474 --> 15:36.060
- OKAY.

15:36.143 --> 15:37.436
- EXCELLENT.
I GET TO PICK THE CHALLENGE.

15:37.519 --> 15:39.480
- HANG ON.

15:39.563 --> 15:42.941
- DONKEY DINER.

15:43.025 --> 15:45.986
IF YOU CAN EAT THREE GALLONS
OF CREAMED CARROT,

15:46.070 --> 15:49.490
I'LL PERSONALLY
SPONSOR YOU $100.

15:51.283 --> 15:52.951
- [stammering]
$100?

15:53.035 --> 15:53.994
- $150 THEN.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.079
DEAL?

15:55.162 --> 15:57.873
- DONE.

15:57.956 --> 16:00.000
- WHO IS THIS GUY?

16:00.084 --> 16:01.377
- HEY, JEROME.

16:01.460 --> 16:02.920
I STILL DON'T HAVE A PARTNER
FOR WONKY DONKEY, YEAH?

16:03.962 --> 16:04.463
- YES, YOU HAVE.

16:04.546 --> 16:06.382
IT'S EDDIE.

16:06.465 --> 16:07.758
- HIM?
- ME?

16:07.841 --> 16:09.635
- OH, YOU'LL BOND.

16:09.718 --> 16:13.097
SEE, DONKEY DAY IS ALREADY
BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER.

16:25.776 --> 16:27.277
- CELLAR KEY.

16:35.411 --> 16:35.994
- OH.

16:36.078 --> 16:37.162
- OH, HELLO, VICTOR.

16:37.246 --> 16:40.582
I GAVE CORBIERE'S BEAK
AN EXTRA POLISH.

16:40.666 --> 16:43.252
HE LOOKS RATHER FINE,

16:43.335 --> 16:44.545
JUST LIKE HIS MASTER.

16:44.628 --> 16:47.673
- WELL, I, UM--

16:47.756 --> 16:51.593
AH, YES.

16:51.677 --> 16:54.596
THE NEW BOY I TOLD YOU ABOUT HAS
ARRIVED,

16:54.680 --> 16:56.724
NOW, WATCH OUT FOR HIM,

16:56.807 --> 16:58.600
BECAUSE HE IS SOMETHING
OF A TROUBLEMAKER

16:58.684 --> 17:00.769
ON ALL ACCOUNTS.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.396
- OH, I WILL.
THANK YOU FOR THE WARNING.

17:02.479 --> 17:04.021
ALTHOUGH, IN MY EXPERIENCE,

17:04.106 --> 17:06.108
IT WAS THE QUIET ONES HAVE
TO WATCH:

17:06.191 --> 17:09.111
NINA AND FABIAN, FOR EXAMPLE.

17:09.194 --> 17:13.031
- YOU ARE A VERY ASTUTE WOMAN,
VERA.

17:17.077 --> 17:19.121
[door slams]

17:26.044 --> 17:27.128
- DID YOU GET THE MONEY?

17:27.212 --> 17:30.132
- WELL, HERE'S WHAT I'VE RAISED
SO FAR.

17:30.215 --> 17:31.467
[change clinking]

17:31.550 --> 17:33.927
- IS THIS SOME KIND OF A JOKE?

17:34.011 --> 17:35.304
YOU OWE ME MORE THAN THIS, SON.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.681
- AND YOU WILL GET THE REST
ONCE DONKEY DAY IS OVER.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.099
- JEROME.

17:39.183 --> 17:40.058
- MARA!

17:40.142 --> 17:41.977
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:42.060 --> 17:42.811
- HE'S PAYING HIS DEBTS, LOVE.
THAT'S WHAT.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.731
- IS THAT DONKEY MONEY?

17:46.899 --> 17:48.567
- IT BETTER NOT BE.

17:48.650 --> 17:50.486
- I KNEW IT.

17:50.569 --> 17:51.528
DONKEY DAY IS JUST ONE BIG SCAM,
ISN'T IT?

17:51.612 --> 17:52.821
- MARA, I CAN EXPLAIN.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.783
- HOW COULD YOU DO IT
TO THOSE SICK DONKEYS?

17:55.866 --> 17:57.910
DO YOU WANT TO END UP
LIKE YOUR DAD?

17:57.993 --> 18:00.496
- THERE ARE NO SICK DONKEYS,
MARA.

18:02.289 --> 18:03.707
- WELL, FIND SOME, THEN,

18:03.791 --> 18:06.293
OR I'LL LET THE DONKEY
OUT OF THE BAG.

18:10.005 --> 18:11.173
- GET OFF.

18:24.603 --> 18:27.648
[door rattling]

18:32.778 --> 18:34.154
- WHAT ARE WE GOING
TO DO WITH THIS?

18:34.238 --> 18:36.490
WE NEED TO PUT IT
BACK INTO PLACE,

18:36.573 --> 18:37.574
LIKE, TONIGHT.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.493
- OKAY.

18:39.576 --> 18:41.036
- NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT.

18:41.119 --> 18:42.371
- NO--
- AMBER.

18:42.454 --> 18:43.789
- VERA WILL BE GETTING DINNER
READY ANY MINUTE.

18:43.872 --> 18:45.624
- WE DON'T HAVE TO GO IN
THAT WAY.

18:45.707 --> 18:46.291
- [stammering]

18:46.375 --> 18:48.168
- NO, AMBER, AMBER!

18:48.252 --> 18:49.545
- NO!

18:56.718 --> 18:58.887
- VERA!

18:58.971 --> 18:59.888
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:59.972 --> 19:04.893
- OH, VICTOR, YOU STARTLED ME.

19:04.977 --> 19:05.978
I THINK SOME OF THE STUDENTS
HAVE GONE DOWN INTO THE CELLAR.

19:06.061 --> 19:08.981
LOOK.
THE DOOR'S UNLOCKED.

19:09.064 --> 19:11.233
- STAND ASIDE, MY DEAR.

19:11.316 --> 19:14.153
YOU LEAVE THIS TO ME.

19:15.779 --> 19:19.241
WHO'S DOWN THERE?

19:19.324 --> 19:20.450
- VICTOR'S IN THE CELLAR.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.331
- SHOW YOURSELVES.

19:32.796 --> 19:35.048
HE'S RIGHT THERE.

19:36.383 --> 19:38.635
SHH.

20:06.538 --> 20:09.291
- FALSE ALARM, MY DEAR.

20:09.374 --> 20:10.584
THERE'S NO ONE THERE.

20:10.667 --> 20:12.085
ALTHOUGH I WOULD VERY MUCH
LIKE TO KNOW

20:12.169 --> 20:15.672
WHY THIS DOOR WAS UNLOCKED.

20:17.215 --> 20:21.011
I AM GOING TO GO
AND CHECK ON MY KEYS.

20:22.888 --> 20:25.098
- OKAY, LET'S GO.

20:25.182 --> 20:27.392
THIS IS WAY TOO RISKY.

20:27.476 --> 20:28.268
- OKAY, OKAY.

20:35.108 --> 20:38.195
[door clattering]

20:43.033 --> 20:43.867
- OH, NO.

20:43.951 --> 20:44.660
I FORGOT TO PUT THIS BACK.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.912
- CAN WE TAKE IT BACK DOWN?

20:46.995 --> 20:47.955
- NOT NOW.

20:48.038 --> 20:49.498
WE'LL HIDE IT IN OUR ROOM.

20:49.581 --> 20:51.708
- OKAY.

21:17.484 --> 21:20.320
- [strange growling]

21:30.956 --> 21:31.957
- NO!

21:42.092 --> 21:44.761
- DON'T BE AFRAID.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.183
TAKE MY HAND.

21:55.522 --> 21:58.317
- [screaming]
