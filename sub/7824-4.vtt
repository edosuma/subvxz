Not yet, sir.

What are you using
for bait?

01:45.930 --> 01:47.530
My brother's
using worms

01:47.600 --> 01:49.760
but I, who feel
the tranquility

01:49.840 --> 01:51.310
far outweighs the actual
catching of fish

01:51.370 --> 01:52.230
am using nothing.

01:52.310 --> 01:54.780
I see. What's your name, son?

01:54.840 --> 01:56.570
I'm Bart Simpson.
Who the hell are you?

01:56.650 --> 01:58.050
I'm Dave Shutton.

I'm an investigative reporter
who's on the road a lot.

02:02.080 --> 02:05.110
I must say, that in my day,
we didn't talk that way
to our elders.

Well this is my day,
and we do, sir.

Leave it to good 'ol
Mary Bailey to finally
step in and do something

02:38.650 --> 02:41.420
about that hideous
genetic mutation.

02:41.490 --> 02:42.990
Mary Bailey! Well,
if I was governor

02:43.060 --> 02:45.000
I'd sure find
better things to do
with my time.

02:45.060 --> 02:46.230
Like what?

02:46.300 --> 02:47.600

Washington's birthday

Huh?

03:41.650 --> 03:44.120
I suppose that's normal
background radiation--

03:44.190 --> 03:45.520
the kind you'd find

03:45.590 --> 03:48.190
in any well-maintained
nuclear facility

03:48.260 --> 03:50.130
or for that matter,
playgrounds and hospitals.

always been like that.

Uh... just resting my eyes.

04:11.810 --> 04:13.110

Monitoring station unmanned.

04:17.850 --> 04:19.910
Look here, inspector

04:19.990 --> 04:23.960
could I speak to you
privately in my office?

04:24.030 --> 04:26.560
Mr. Burns, in 20 years

04:26.630 --> 04:29.630
I have never seen
such a shoddy, deplorable...

04:29.700 --> 04:31.000
Oh, look.

04:31.070 --> 04:34.040
Some careless person
has left thousands

04:34.100 --> 04:35.300
and thousands of dollars

04:35.370 --> 04:37.680
just lying here
on my coffee table.

04:37.740 --> 04:40.450
Smithers, why don't
we leave the room

04:40.510 --> 04:42.450
and hopefully,
when we return

04:42.510 --> 04:44.980
the pile of money
will be gone.

04:48.020 --> 04:49.050
D-ohh!

04:49.120 --> 04:50.660
Look, Smithers,
the money

04:50.720 --> 04:53.730
and a very stupid man
are still here.

04:53.790 --> 04:57.060
Burns, if I didn't
know better, I'd think
you were trying to bribe me.

04:57.130 --> 05:00.160
Is there some confusion
about this?

05:00.230 --> 05:02.330
Take it, you poor <i>shmo.</i>

05:02.400 --> 05:06.140
Mr. Burns, I'm going
to overlook this felony.

05:06.200 --> 05:09.870
However, I will not overlook
the 342 violations

05:09.940 --> 05:12.610
I have observed
at your plant today.

05:12.670 --> 05:15.200
Either bring this place
up to code

05:15.280 --> 05:16.980
or we'll
shut it down.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.320
Good day.

05:18.380 --> 05:20.690
Oh, well.

A little dab of paint here

05:24.950 --> 05:28.850
how much could it possibly cost
to fix this place up?

05:28.920 --> 05:30.950
Approximately $56 million, sir.

05:31.030 --> 05:31.800
$56 million?!

05:31.860 --> 05:32.660
Don't hit me, sir.

05:32.730 --> 05:33.830
Oh, that I had the strength

05:33.900 --> 05:35.830
to take it out on you, Smithers.

Ooh! Cushy.

Homer, they're trying

to shut us down.

07:33.180 --> 07:35.290
They say we're
contaminating the planet.

07:35.350 --> 07:36.990
Well, nobody's perfect.

07:37.050 --> 07:40.090
Can't the government
just get off our backs?

07:40.160 --> 07:43.860
I was just telling the
wife that if I was governor,
I'd do things a lot differently.

07:43.930 --> 07:45.960
Oh, get off your soapbox,
Simpson! Do you realize how much

07:46.030 --> 07:48.800
it costs to run for office?
More than any honest man
could afford!

I bet <i>you could afford it,
though.</i>

I just meant that you could
afford to run for governor
if you felt like it.

07:58.810 --> 08:01.950
Of course, I'm just rambling
because you keep staring at me
like that, but it's true.

08:02.010 --> 08:03.680
I mean, if you were governor

08:03.750 --> 08:06.820
you could decide
what's safe and what isn't.

Frankly, I don't see
how one of the most despicable
men who ever lived

08:34.460 --> 08:36.260
has a chance against
Mary Bailey,

08:36.330 --> 08:37.799

beloved governor

08:37.860 --> 08:39.559
our great state
has ever known.

Now, here's the problem
as I see it.

08:42.429 --> 08:44.730
While Governor Bailey
is beloved by all

08:44.800 --> 08:46.300
98% of the voters

08:46.370 --> 08:49.240

08:49.310 --> 08:50.850
That's why we've assembled

Ah, excellent!

the kind of trickery

09:13.700 --> 09:17.310
But how do we turn your average
Joe Six-pack against
Mary Bailey?

Thank you.

09:32.420 --> 09:34.490
But first

09:34.550 --> 09:38.220
there's a burning issue that
we need to address and
to neutralize immediately.

10:03.780 --> 10:05.650
Sorry, Barney.

anything about that

Oh Marge, what's the big deal?
I'll bet before the papers

10:12.460 --> 10:13.660

of proportion

10:49.060 --> 10:52.370
Many of you consider him to be
a hideous genetic mutation.

10:52.430 --> 10:54.970
Nothing could be further
from the truth.

10:55.030 --> 10:58.300
But don't take my word for it.
Let's ask an actor portraying
Charles Darwin

10:58.370 --> 10:59.810
what he thinks.

10:59.870 --> 11:01.140
Hello, Mr. Burns.

11:01.210 --> 11:02.540
Oh, hello, Charles.

11:02.610 --> 11:03.880
Be a good fellow, and
tell our viewers

11:03.940 --> 11:06.310
about your theory
of natural selection.

11:06.380 --> 11:07.950
Glad to, Mr. Burns.

11:08.010 --> 11:11.210
You see, every so often,
mother nature changes
her animals

11:11.280 --> 11:14.650
giving them bigger teeth,
sharper claws, longer legs

11:14.720 --> 11:17.260
or, in this case, a third eye.

11:17.320 --> 11:19.230
<i>And if
these variations</i>

11:19.290 --> 11:20.660
turn out to be an improvement

11:20.730 --> 11:23.060
the new animals
thrive and multiply

11:23.130 --> 11:25.100
and spread across
the face of the Earth.

11:25.160 --> 11:27.160
So you're saying this fish

11:27.230 --> 11:29.870
might have an advantage
over other fish?

11:29.940 --> 11:31.740
It may in fact,
be a kind of superfish.

11:31.800 --> 11:34.100
I wouldn't mind having
a third eye. Would you?

11:34.170 --> 11:35.830
Heh-heh-heh... no.

11:35.910 --> 11:39.180
You see friends, if our
anti-nuclear nay-sayers
and choose-up-siders

11:39.240 --> 11:42.770
were to come upon an elephant
frolicking in the waters

11:42.850 --> 11:44.520
next to our nuclear power plant

11:44.580 --> 11:47.280
they'd probably blame
his ridiculous nose

11:47.350 --> 11:49.120
on the nuclear bogeyman.

11:49.190 --> 11:50.290
The truth is, this fish

11:50.360 --> 11:51.960
is a miracle of nature

11:52.020 --> 11:53.350
with a taste

11:53.430 --> 11:54.600
that can't be beat.

11:54.660 --> 11:55.800
Mm-mmm!

11:55.860 --> 11:57.300
So, to summarize...

11:57.360 --> 11:59.870
say what you want about me.

11:59.930 --> 12:02.870
I can take the slings
and arrows

12:02.930 --> 12:05.960
but stop slandering
poor, defenseless Blinky.

12:06.040 --> 12:07.340
Good night

12:07.410 --> 12:09.080
<i>and God bless.</i>

12:09.140 --> 12:12.550
Chorus:
♪ Only a moron
wouldn't cast his vote ♪

12:12.610 --> 12:16.080
♪ for Mon-teee Burns! ♪

12:16.150 --> 12:18.120
Wow! Superfish!

12:18.180 --> 12:21.310
I wish the government <i>would
get off his back.</i>

12:21.390 --> 12:24.590
That Burns is just
what this state needs--

12:24.660 --> 12:26.390
young blood!

12:26.460 --> 12:29.300
I hope Burns and I can count
on your support, honey?

12:29.360 --> 12:31.330
Homer, I'm
a Bailey booster.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.770
Oh yeah? Well, I'm
a Burns booster.

12:33.830 --> 12:34.870
Ow!

12:34.930 --> 12:36.390
Congratulations
Mr. Burns,

12:36.470 --> 12:38.940
The latest polls show
you're up six points.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.700
Giving me a total of..?

12:40.770 --> 12:43.140
Six... but
we're on our way.

12:43.210 --> 12:47.480
Mary Bailey:
My worthy opponent
seems to think that the voters

12:47.550 --> 12:49.350
of this state
are gullible fools.

12:49.410 --> 12:51.040
I, however

12:51.120 --> 12:53.920
prefer to rely
on their intelligence
and good judgment.

12:53.990 --> 12:55.520
Interesting strategy.
Good luck.

12:55.590 --> 12:57.960
I say taxes are too high!

12:58.020 --> 12:59.250
( <i>cheering )</i>

13:03.560 --> 13:06.570
( <i>crowd cheering )</i>

13:14.440 --> 13:16.710
( <i>crowd cheering )</i>

13:23.680 --> 13:26.520
Have you found any dirt
on Mary Bailey?

13:26.580 --> 13:27.210
Well, we've gone through
her garbage.

13:27.290 --> 13:28.660
We talked to her maid.

13:28.720 --> 13:30.320
And so far, the only negative
thing we have found

13:30.390 --> 13:33.190
was from some guy who dated
her when she was 16.

13:33.260 --> 13:34.260
Ah!... and?

13:34.330 --> 13:35.600
He uh, he felt her up.

13:35.660 --> 13:37.160
Bah!
Not good enough.

13:37.230 --> 13:40.730
We're going to send a message

13:40.800 --> 13:45.410
to those bureaucrats
down there in the state capital!

13:47.010 --> 13:48.940
Is your boss
governor yet?

13:49.010 --> 13:50.810
Not yet, son, not yet.

13:51.740 --> 13:53.700
The voters now see you

13:53.780 --> 13:54.980
as imperial
and God-like.

13:55.050 --> 13:56.580
Hot dog!

13:56.650 --> 13:58.790
But there's a downside to it.
The latest polls indicate

13:58.850 --> 14:00.620
you're in danger of
losing touch with the
common man.

14:00.690 --> 14:02.260
Oh, dear. Heaven forefend!

14:02.320 --> 14:03.960
Which is why the night before
the election

14:04.020 --> 14:05.430
we want you

14:05.490 --> 14:08.630
to have dinner at the home
of one of your workers.

14:08.690 --> 14:10.690
Oh, I get your angle.

14:10.760 --> 14:13.300
Every Joe Meatball
and Sally Housecoat

14:13.360 --> 14:15.730
in this God-forsaken state
will see me

14:15.800 --> 14:18.540
hunkering down chow
with Eddie Punchclock.

14:18.600 --> 14:21.300
The media will have a field day.

14:21.370 --> 14:23.800
Manager:
The only question is--

14:23.880 --> 14:26.350
can we find someone
common enough?

14:30.880 --> 14:31.790
( <i>belches )</i>

14:31.850 --> 14:32.850
Ugh.

14:34.890 --> 14:38.990
Well, I knew there
would be sacrifices.

14:40.560 --> 14:41.360
( <i>belches )</i>

14:45.480 --> 14:49.390
Oh, great toast, Marge!

14:49.450 --> 14:50.790
Mm.., oh by the way

14:50.850 --> 14:51.860
the night
before the election

14:51.920 --> 14:52.590
Mr. Burns is coming
over for dinner.

14:52.650 --> 14:54.620
What?

14:54.690 --> 14:56.360
And some reporters and
camera crew, but you don't need
to feed <i>them.</i>

14:56.420 --> 14:57.850
Cool man! A media circus.

14:57.930 --> 14:59.100
Absolutely not.

14:59.160 --> 15:00.730
Come on, Marge.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.730
I'm going to be
ringing doorbells
for Mary Bailey that night.

15:03.800 --> 15:04.740
D-ohh!

15:04.800 --> 15:06.140
Kids, please leave the room.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.340
I don't want you
to see this.

15:08.400 --> 15:09.700
Uh-oh.

15:09.770 --> 15:12.840
Please, please, please,
please, please, please.

15:12.910 --> 15:13.740
( <i>growling )</i>

15:15.710 --> 15:17.110
We're hoping that
one of the children

15:17.180 --> 15:19.550
might pop up with a question
about the upcoming election.

15:19.610 --> 15:21.880
Little girl, do you think
you can memorize this
by dinnertime tomorrow?

15:21.950 --> 15:24.490
"Mr. Burns, your campaign
seems to have

15:24.550 --> 15:26.280
"the momentum
of a runaway freight train.

15:26.350 --> 15:27.720
Why are you so popular?"

15:27.790 --> 15:29.730
Very good.

15:29.790 --> 15:32.230
Well as long as I'm asking
something, can I ask him
to assuage my fears

15:32.290 --> 15:33.690
that he's contaminating
the planet

15:33.760 --> 15:36.700
in a manner that may one day
render it uninhabitable?

15:36.760 --> 15:38.290
No dear, the card question
will be fine.

15:38.370 --> 15:39.940
I think the non-card question
is a valid...

15:40.000 --> 15:41.110
Marge!

15:41.170 --> 15:43.240
Don't worry.
My daughter's very bright.

15:43.300 --> 15:45.770
I'm sure she'll be able to
memorize your question
by dinnertime tomorrow.

15:45.840 --> 15:47.340
And finally,

15:47.410 --> 15:51.320
Mr. Burns wants you to appear
<i>very affectionate to him</i>

15:51.380 --> 15:54.150
but we must remind you,
he hates being touched.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.160
( <i>growls )</i>

15:59.220 --> 16:00.790
Mmm?

16:00.860 --> 16:02.630
Marge, get back in bed.

16:02.690 --> 16:04.700
No, I'm just fine
right here.

16:04.760 --> 16:06.500
What's wrong?
I just want to snuggle.

16:06.560 --> 16:07.800
Well, I don't feel
like snuggling.

16:07.860 --> 16:09.960
What's that got
to do with it?

16:10.030 --> 16:12.370
I don't wanna snuggle
with anybody who's not
letting me express myself.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.800
But you <i>do get
to express yourself</i>

16:14.870 --> 16:18.080
and the lovely home you keep
and the food you serve.

16:18.140 --> 16:19.910
Hmm... okay, Homer.

16:19.970 --> 16:21.400
Fair enough.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.850
You got it.

16:22.910 --> 16:23.480
All right.

16:23.550 --> 16:25.420
Good. That's it.

16:25.480 --> 16:27.350
That's how I'm going
to express myself.
That's right.

16:27.420 --> 16:28.350
Good night.

16:28.420 --> 16:29.290
Huh?

16:33.890 --> 16:37.260
( <i>TV crew chattering )</i>

16:40.730 --> 16:42.830
Well, what do
we think?

16:42.900 --> 16:45.340
Hey, hello, handsome.

16:45.400 --> 16:47.570
Hey, get that stuff
off his face.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.970
We're here to have dinner
with a common man

16:50.040 --> 16:51.340
not Tyrone Power.

16:51.410 --> 16:52.680
Latest polls are in.

16:52.740 --> 16:53.680
It's dead even.

16:53.740 --> 16:55.080
Fifty-fifty.

This cornball stunt is gonna
put us over the top.

Whoa, he's here!

17:22.940 --> 17:24.240

Mr. Burns?

17:32.280 --> 17:35.690
Oh, of course. A little
roughhousing with the pets is
good for a man's appetite.

17:42.320 --> 17:43.550
The latest polls
are in.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.060
The statesman-like way
you handled the pet incident

17:45.130 --> 17:46.600
has put you over the top.

17:46.660 --> 17:48.230
You're ahead, 51 to 49.

Excellent.

Bart, would you
like to say grace?

17:54.400 --> 17:57.270
Dear God... we pay for
all this stuff ourselves,

with such blasphemy.

Where do you stand on this
highly controversial issue?

18:23.460 --> 18:25.730
Goodness, I didn't realize
this casual dinner

18:25.800 --> 18:28.640
was going to turn into
a charged political debate.

18:28.700 --> 18:30.130
I was only reading
what the card...

18:30.200 --> 18:32.970
Homer, I agree with you,
and if I'm elected governor

18:33.040 --> 18:36.080
I will lower taxes
whether those bureaucrats

18:36.140 --> 18:38.410
in the state capital
like it or not!

18:38.480 --> 18:40.550
Lisa, do you
have a question

18:40.620 --> 18:42.250
you would like to ask your
Uncle Montgomery?

18:42.320 --> 18:43.250
Yes, sir.

18:43.320 --> 18:44.720
A very inane one.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.020
( <i>Lisa sighs )</i>

18:46.090 --> 18:49.290
Mr. Burns, your campaign
seems to have the momentum

18:49.360 --> 18:51.260
of a runaway freight train.

18:51.330 --> 18:53.130
Why are you so popular?

18:53.190 --> 18:55.760
Ooh, a tough question,
but a fair one.

18:55.830 --> 18:58.170
Lisa, there's no single answer.

18:58.230 --> 19:00.690
Some voters
respond to my integrity.

19:00.770 --> 19:03.010
Others are more impressed with
my incorruptibility.

19:03.070 --> 19:06.510
Still others by my determination
to lower taxes

19:06.570 --> 19:10.370
and the bureaucrats in the
state capitol can put that
in their pipes and smoke it!

19:10.450 --> 19:12.320
Oh, Mom, that felt awful.

19:12.380 --> 19:13.650
I'm sorry, dear.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.450
It will all be over soon.

19:15.520 --> 19:18.190
But Mom, we've become
the tools of evil.

19:18.250 --> 19:20.110
Lisa, you're learning
many lessons tonight

19:20.190 --> 19:21.690
and one of them is

19:21.760 --> 19:25.360
to always give your mother
the benefit of the doubt.

19:25.430 --> 19:27.700
Burns:
...or even a square deal.

Here's your headline, Phil--

20:20.850 --> 20:22.850
"Burns can't swallow own story."

20:22.920 --> 20:25.120
The latest polls indicate
Burns' popularity has
plummeted to Earth

20:25.190 --> 20:27.320
like so much half-chewed fish.

20:27.390 --> 20:30.460
You must have a few tricks
left up your sleeve.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.460
Smithers, boil some coffee.

20:32.530 --> 20:33.730
We're not licked yet.

20:33.800 --> 20:34.970
Yes, we are.

20:35.030 --> 20:36.230
Come on, boys,
the old guy's finished.

20:36.300 --> 20:40.070
Wait! Come back.
You can't do this to me.

20:40.130 --> 20:42.200
I'm Charles Montgomery Burns!

20:43.600 --> 20:46.600
( <i>grunting )</i>

20:49.780 --> 20:51.210
( <i>grunting )</i>

20:51.280 --> 20:53.820
Smithers, tip over
this table for me.

20:53.880 --> 20:54.920
Yes, sir.

20:54.980 --> 20:56.140
Homer...

20:56.220 --> 20:57.990
Homer, make them stop.

20:58.050 --> 20:59.110
Ahem!

20:59.190 --> 21:00.290
Uh, Mr. Burns?

21:00.350 --> 21:01.480
Uh, Mr. Burns?

21:01.560 --> 21:03.290
Shut up and wreck something.

21:03.360 --> 21:04.190
Mr. Burns?

21:04.260 --> 21:05.300
I hardly see

21:05.360 --> 21:07.500
what destroying our
meager possessions

21:07.560 --> 21:09.100
is going to accomplish.

21:09.160 --> 21:11.360
She's right.

21:11.430 --> 21:13.160
Take me home, Smithers.

21:13.230 --> 21:15.400
We'll destroy
something tasteful.

21:17.570 --> 21:18.740
Ironic isn't it, Smithers?

21:18.810 --> 21:21.980
This anonymous clan
of slack-jawed troglodytes

21:22.040 --> 21:23.840
has cost me the election

21:23.910 --> 21:26.320
and yet if I were
to have them killed

21:26.380 --> 21:28.620
<i>I would be the one
to go to jail.</i>

21:28.680 --> 21:30.510
That's democracy for you.

21:30.590 --> 21:32.820
You are noble and poetic
in defeat, sir.

21:32.890 --> 21:36.560
Simpson, I shall make it
the focus of my remaining years

21:36.620 --> 21:39.750
that your dreams
will go unfulfilled.

21:39.830 --> 21:42.230
Uh-oh, you're busted, Dad.

21:42.300 --> 21:44.600
Homer:
My dreams will go unfulfilled?

21:44.670 --> 21:47.540
Oh, no. I don't like
the sound of that one bit.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.510
That means I have
nothing to hope for.

21:49.570 --> 21:51.140
Marge, make it
better, please?

21:51.210 --> 21:52.880
Can't you make it better?

21:52.940 --> 21:55.380
Homer, when
a man's biggest dreams

21:55.440 --> 21:58.710
include seconds on dessert,
occasional snuggling

21:58.780 --> 22:01.280
and sleeping till noon
on weekends

22:01.350 --> 22:03.990
no one man can destroy them.

22:04.050 --> 22:05.590
Hey, you did it!
