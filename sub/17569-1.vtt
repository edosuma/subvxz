00:25.611 --> 00:31.367
There was once upon a time a town,
not far from a big city.

00:32.828 --> 00:37.003
A road ran through, but there were
only a few businesses.

00:37.213 --> 00:41.427
A coffee shop, a hardware store,
a sheriff's office.

00:42.678 --> 00:44.800
And all kinds of people..

00:44.971 --> 00:47.553
Vagrants, runaway teens...

00:47.723 --> 00:52.098
Religious fanatics, retired seniors who...

00:52.478 --> 00:58.194
Well, it was a town of those who
want to be left alone...

00:58.815 --> 01:01.107
And so they were.

01:05.572 --> 01:10.366
Sheriff, Bobby LaGrange, had
been there for years...

01:10.827 --> 01:14.040
Also made wood novelties.

01:16.503 --> 01:18.755
But the most astonishing
thing about the town was...

01:18.915 --> 01:23.510
An old belfry, that had a clock
tower with seven faces.

01:24.801 --> 01:28.845
You could see the time from anywhere
in the town of Swann valley.

01:29.976 --> 01:34.020
The faces persistently
told different times.

01:34.641 --> 01:39.065
No question, something evil
was abiding there.

01:41.648 --> 01:46.493
Perhaps it was because of the terrible
murder that happened years before.

01:46.653 --> 01:51.578
Too terrible to talk about. But
which haunted the town.

01:53.410 --> 01:58.045
Or perhaps it was those teenagers who
gathered across the lake.

01:58.335 --> 02:01.378
Some people thought they did bad things.

02:01.548 --> 02:03.841
Worshiped Satan.

02:04.381 --> 02:07.344
The way they dressed, the
music they played...

02:07.514 --> 02:10.967
And their mysterious leader known
only as flamingo.

02:11.138 --> 02:13.430
A seducer of innocent youth...

02:13.971 --> 02:17.605
And some said... far worse.

02:20.437 --> 02:23.691
It was at this certain time...
That a third string writer...

02:23.861 --> 02:26.944
Of popular fiction, hall Baltimore...

02:27.194 --> 02:30.698
Drove into Swann valley. On his book
signing tour...

02:30.868 --> 02:34.662
Of another of his series of novels...

02:34.832 --> 02:37.625
About witchcraft.

02:37.875 --> 02:40.047
Excuse me, do you know where
the bookstore is?

02:40.167 --> 02:43.501
- There's no bookstore around here.
- Great.

03:05.403 --> 03:07.986
Have you ever read a hall Baltimore
thriller?

03:08.116 --> 03:10.408
No, thanks.

03:19.708 --> 03:22.130
Have you ever read hall Baltimore
thriller?

03:22.290 --> 03:25.754
No... who is hall Baltimore?

03:25.924 --> 03:29.548
- I am he.
- Oh. Nice to meet you.

03:29.678 --> 03:32.891
- And you are...
- Stacey.

03:33.552 --> 03:38.437
- Oh excuse me, sorry.
- Hi Stacey. Bye Stacey.

03:40.519 --> 03:41.269
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:42.310 --> 03:45.774
You sell weapons?

03:46.275 --> 03:48.487
- Uh, no weapons, just ammunition.
- Pistols?

03:48.657 --> 03:50.949
- Ammunition?
- Yes.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.782
- Knives?
- Isle 2.

03:56.285 --> 04:00.419
The hall Baltimore. I'll take one.

04:01.290 --> 04:05.884
- Could you uh... autograph it?
- Sure.

04:06.045 --> 04:11.090
<i>To Bobby LaGrange.</i>

04:11.470 --> 04:15.684
<i>To Bobby LaGrange. Best witches.
Hall Baltimore.</i>

04:18.397 --> 04:22.231
How does it feel to be the bargain
basement Stephen king?

04:23.402 --> 04:25.484
Not too wonderful.

04:25.654 --> 04:31.280
Well, you know, I uh, I write
horror stories myself.

04:31.911 --> 04:35.705
You don't say? And you're the
sheriff here in the town?

04:36.495 --> 04:38.788
40 years.

04:39.869 --> 04:45.004
You wouldn't uh, or would you,
mind reading some of my stuff?

04:45.465 --> 04:50.259
I'd be much obliged.
You know we had a mass murder.

04:50.720 --> 04:53.012
A while back.

04:53.182 --> 04:56.095
A lot of folks think the town's haunted

04:57.267 --> 05:02.522
well, I'm, I'm uh, just wrapping
it up here in the town...

05:02.692 --> 05:04.984
And then I'm gonna be on my way.

05:05.815 --> 05:10.029
You a mystery writer and you're not
interested in mass murder?

05:10.200 --> 05:12.492
No.

05:14.364 --> 05:16.496
You come with me right now...

05:16.656 --> 05:20.710
And take a look at the doozie
I got in the morgue.

05:22.913 --> 05:25.545
- You got a doozie in the morgue?
- Yes sir.

05:25.916 --> 05:28.218
- Now?
- Yes, sir.

05:29.169 --> 05:31.471
There's a story in it.

05:55.496 --> 05:59.660
- I know what this must look like...
- It is like a wood...

05:59.830 --> 06:03.834
- Ow! Jesus! Let me ask you a question.
How long have you worked here?
- Well

06:04.204 --> 06:08.459
you don't run a gurney with a dead
person on over my foot!

06:08.629 --> 06:10.921
Sorry, sheriff.

06:15.676 --> 06:20.351
- Is this a common occurrence in Swann valley?
- It's happened before.

06:20.521 --> 06:24.975
Serial killing it appears to be
leaves a calling card as a wooden stake.

06:31.032 --> 06:35.116
- I don't want to see her face.
- I don't blame you.

06:35.286 --> 06:38.539
I mean, it's really a tragedy.
She's just a poor girl.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.832
- Arbus?
- Yeah?
- Arbus!

06:40.992 --> 06:44.045
- Alright, alright.
- You're on the clock.

06:46.167 --> 06:48.669
- Do you know who she is?
- This girl?

06:49.460 --> 06:52.053
We get all kind here
vagrants, runaways..

06:52.213 --> 06:54.716
Worse, those kids out at the lake.

06:55.506 --> 06:57.809
All kinds.

07:00.512 --> 07:05.937
How'd you like to collaborate on a book
about this? You and me?

07:08.900 --> 07:13.695
Are you gonna... leave that
stake in her like that?

07:21.583 --> 07:24.536
- Howdy. I'd like to fill my
thermos full of coffee, please.
- Okay

07:34.716 --> 07:36.798
Edgar Allan poe slept in this town?

07:36.928 --> 07:39.431
- Sure did.
- At the old chickering hotel

07:41.393 --> 07:43.685
way back when.

07:44.516 --> 07:49.111
- Chickering hotel... thanks.
- Have a good day.

08:28.771 --> 08:31.063
With my respect sir.

10:20.384 --> 10:22.466
I want to write something I do.

10:22.636 --> 10:25.139
I want to write something for me.
Something personal.

10:25.309 --> 10:30.524
Does that make any sense? I have to
break the spell of this downward spiral.

10:30.725 --> 10:32.736
There's only one way to
do it and I'm trying to

10:32.749 --> 10:34.729
do it. I'm not gonna write
another witch book.

10:34.899 --> 10:39.363
I told them that... and, and, and that's
it, I'm gonna do something for me.

10:39.734 --> 10:41.826
You've done it before

10:41.986 --> 10:44.789
when you weren't drinking.
Before Vicky's accident.

10:47.291 --> 10:49.744
I can't rush these things.

10:50.124 --> 10:54.919
You can do this. I... I know what...
I know what you mean about

10:56.000 --> 10:59.260
you just have to do it one more time.
Just... write the

10:59.273 --> 11:02.427
damn thing, then you can,
then you can take the time

11:02.557 --> 11:06.261
and write what you really want to write.
I understand, I get it. You know I do.

11:07.102 --> 11:09.724
Did you call Sam? Did you tell him
we need an advance?

11:09.854 --> 11:11.885
Well I did and it was
extremely humiliating.

11:11.898 --> 11:13.939
And I'm not gonna write
another witch story.

11:14.319 --> 11:15.856
- You're having a holiday?
- No I'm...

11:15.857 --> 11:17.060
And I'm stuck here.

11:17.095 --> 11:19.335
- Listen to me... can you?
- Trying to put people off...

11:19.524 --> 11:23.278
Come up with magic numbers...
To make it all work out.

11:23.408 --> 11:26.280
Pretend there's nothing wrong
and put food on the table.

11:26.281 --> 11:27.181
Denise will you listen to me?

11:27.222 --> 11:31.206
You can't, you can't speak to me like
this... just grow up... Grow up!

11:31.416 --> 11:34.489
People always ask me, "how do you
know so much about witches?"

11:34.550 --> 11:37.382
And I tell them,
"'cause I married one."

14:30.808 --> 14:36.224
- Hey.
- Hello. Where do you come from?

14:37.024 --> 14:39.817
Just down the road. You past me.

14:43.531 --> 14:45.653
You looking at my teeth?

14:45.823 --> 14:48.947
No I'm not, I just didn't
know where you came from.

14:49.157 --> 14:51.870
I am very self conscious
about my buck teeth.

14:52.160 --> 14:54.452
Show me.

14:56.835 --> 14:59.748
Your teeth are fine. It's those braces.

15:01.209 --> 15:05.924
- Anyway I hate them.
- No, they're fine. You'll grow into them.

15:06.554 --> 15:09.888
They call me vampira, because of
these teeth.

15:11.640 --> 15:14.643
- But you can call me V.
- V. That's nice.

15:14.973 --> 15:19.608
- What's your real name?
- Virginia.

15:20.188 --> 15:22.481
Virginia.
You're about 13?

15:22.981 --> 15:26.324
Yeah, I'm 12. But I look older
because I'm tall.

15:27.736 --> 15:31.580
I know who you are. You wrote those
witch stories.

15:31.780 --> 15:35.374
And you're here to sign books over
at the hardware store.

15:35.534 --> 15:37.836
I love your books.

15:38.126 --> 15:41.340
Especially the part where Elizabeth says,

15:41.500 --> 15:44.633
"forsake me never, for I will entice
you from my grave."

15:44.793 --> 15:47.096
That's my favorite part.

15:47.716 --> 15:50.929
Thanks, I like your look.

15:51.350 --> 15:53.642
Oh... yeah.

15:54.103 --> 15:56.395
It's just the way I dress.

15:59.188 --> 16:03.362
- You scared of me yet?
- What?

16:03.983 --> 16:06.275
Yes.

16:06.695 --> 16:08.988
A little.

16:10.159 --> 16:14.073
That clock it chimed midnight three
times already.

16:14.413 --> 16:17.126
Keeping track of time
around here is pointless.

16:17.997 --> 16:20.539
That's why I missed your book signing.

16:24.924 --> 16:29.839
Well that old hotel is open. Come on
I'll buy you a soda... sweetie

16:30.219 --> 16:32.301
I have a girl your age.

16:32.432 --> 16:36.896
- No, I don't think that a
particularly good idea.
- Why not?

16:37.096 --> 16:41.601
That's what I had to go to the hardware
store and talk about. My story.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.904
- Well tell it to me now.
- No, I can't.

16:48.358 --> 16:50.660
Come on.

16:58.078 --> 17:00.500
We're open. Come in.

17:01.541 --> 17:06.215
I... went for walk, I guess I got lost.

17:09.679 --> 17:13.512
- Hey what happened to that little girl?
- What little girl?

17:16.847 --> 17:19.479
- Is the restaurant open?
- Restaurant's always open.

17:19.638 --> 17:21.891
What with that old clock
tower and all those

17:21.904 --> 17:23.814
faces, you can get
breakfast anytime.

17:24.483 --> 17:26.777
Yes.

17:29.109 --> 17:32.703
- Well, Mr...
- Baltimore.

17:33.243 --> 17:35.325
Damned clock.

17:35.495 --> 17:37.868
That clock has never told the correct time.

17:38.038 --> 17:40.751
Just you wait. You're gonna
be very surprised.

17:41.161 --> 17:43.464
Bell's the important thing,

17:43.624 --> 17:45.916
and it's working beautifully.

17:46.547 --> 17:49.670
- Better than before.
- I'll just uh, have a beer.

17:49.920 --> 17:54.385
Melvin is the belfry custodian,
assigned to the big clock at church.

17:54.725 --> 17:57.808
It's a hopeless job. And a real burden.

17:58.018 --> 18:00.561
That old mechanism's on
it's last legs.

18:00.731 --> 18:02.853
I go up there about every day, or most.

18:03.023 --> 18:05.435
Those seven faces they
look at me like I was

18:05.448 --> 18:07.818
the one who invented
daylight savings time.

18:08.069 --> 18:10.781
You know who came up with daylight
savings time, don't you?

18:11.492 --> 18:13.694
Hitler. And, you know who supports it now?

18:13.864 --> 18:16.787
Doctors. And you know why? Golf.

18:17.288 --> 18:20.161
They want more time to golf. That's
what it's all about.

18:20.331 --> 18:24.005
You can't change time. Time changes you.

18:26.047 --> 18:30.591
Don't you agree? What's your
position on daylight savings time?

18:31.092 --> 18:35.266
- I've never really thought about it.
- What have you been thinking about?

18:41.392 --> 18:43.935
- That's the grave.
- Grave?

18:44.105 --> 18:47.228
Oh you can walk on it. Don't worry.
The whole floor is a grave.

18:47.358 --> 18:52.323
- It is?
- There are twelve children
buried right down there.

18:52.654 --> 18:55.657
13 children murdered in cold blood.

18:55.827 --> 18:57.909
Well, actually he's right.

18:58.079 --> 19:02.874
It is an even dozen, but one got away and
she was damned.

19:04.746 --> 19:07.459
- When was that?
- Oh, a long time ago.

19:09.050 --> 19:12.754
The clock is fixed.
The clock is fixed.

19:14.556 --> 19:17.099
Ha, the clock is fixed.
The clock is fixed.

20:31.384 --> 20:33.676
Got you, devil.

20:37.340 --> 20:40.894
- She drew blood.
- Suck it out... suck it out, suck it out.

20:41.144 --> 20:43.436
- Goddamn her...
- Hey
- write it down.

20:43.596 --> 20:48.191
- What time did she bite you? 4 o'clock.
- It isn't 4 o’clock.

20:48.401 --> 20:51.444
- The clock says four o'clock.
- You've got to be kidding me?

20:53.406 --> 20:55.699
She's the devil.

21:40.864 --> 21:43.157
It's the dead little kids.

22:06.731 --> 22:09.023
You?

22:13.187 --> 22:15.489
Why are you here?

22:16.821 --> 22:20.785
- What has she told you?
- Nothing. What should she tell me?

22:21.035 --> 22:25.079
Go away, old man... you know what you did.

22:30.375 --> 22:32.877
Children... hurry.

22:33.708 --> 22:36.301
The moon is going down...
Time for nap.

22:40.595 --> 22:44.469
Come on. Come along now, come on.

23:06.661 --> 23:08.954
My God, I'm lost.

23:11.126 --> 23:15.050
Maybe this is what I need,
this story.

23:25.971 --> 23:27.563
Where are you going?

23:37.112 --> 23:39.445
Help me.

23:47.743 --> 23:50.996
You? My God... Edgar poe.

23:54.630 --> 23:56.922
Show me the way.

24:07.393 --> 24:09.685
Hall, wake up.

24:10.056 --> 24:13.229
- Are you, I know you're there.
Are you awake?
- What? It wasn't me.

24:13.399 --> 24:17.273
It's me. This is your wife. Hello?

24:21.317 --> 24:24.570
Hall, wake up. Are you,
i know you're there.

24:24.741 --> 24:26.823
- What's the matter?
- Are you awake? It's me.

24:26.993 --> 24:29.075
What's the matter? Everything okay?

24:29.245 --> 24:31.577
This is your wife. Yeah,
i know who you are.

24:32.378 --> 24:34.500
I didn't, well...

24:34.671 --> 24:38.464
I need a second. What's, oh my God.
What have you done?

24:39.506 --> 24:41.588
Yeah?
That?

24:41.758 --> 24:43.840
- Do you know how much it's worth?
- Yeah, I do.

24:43.970 --> 24:46.262
160,000 dollars.

24:46.433 --> 24:49.265
No, it's worth a lot more than that.
It's priceless.

24:49.396 --> 24:53.149
You shouldn't even be touching it. How did
you get into my safe? Just calm down.

24:53.310 --> 24:56.429
Please stop, just, just,
whatever you're doing, just

24:56.442 --> 24:59.276
stop and put it down.
That's really not a joke..

24:59.816 --> 25:02.659
You think it's. I don't think it's funny.
It's a nice book though eh?

25:02.859 --> 25:04.951
Yes, Whitman only had...

25:05.111 --> 25:08.785
There's only four of those in private hands
okay. Do you understand what that means?

25:09.076 --> 25:11.868
- Do you... He set the type himself.
- Do you think I'm joking?

25:12.039 --> 25:14.171
- Please.
- You know what... I think you care

25:14.331 --> 25:17.254
more this old book than
you do your own family.

25:17.464 --> 25:19.836
- You need the gloves for that.
- You know what?

25:20.007 --> 25:22.299
Get the advance or you
can kiss it good bye.

25:22.469 --> 25:25.552
- Please.
- Don't make me have to do this.

25:26.303 --> 25:29.186
I don't want to... I have to.

26:51.269 --> 26:55.724
- Hello. I'm looking for...
- Mrs. LaGrange is sleeping. Quiet.

26:57.395 --> 26:59.477
Oh, sorry.

26:59.648 --> 27:04.032
I'd like to know if you have any
information on the old chickering hotel?

27:04.282 --> 27:06.785
I'll check the files.

27:16.745 --> 27:19.047
Thank you

29:09.359 --> 29:11.462
Swann valley, sheriff's office please.

29:11.522 --> 29:13.614
One moment.

29:13.634 --> 29:19.580
Your number is 393 229 39 23.
Do you wish to be connected?

29:19.750 --> 29:21.291
Yes.

29:23.504 --> 29:25.215
Sheriff's office, we're closed.

29:25.255 --> 29:28.719
Yes, hi, it's me, you remember me,
the writer.

29:29.009 --> 29:32.343
I'm here at the window.
I'm gonna go to the front door.

29:35.936 --> 29:38.228
Alright.

29:39.690 --> 29:41.772
- We're closed.
- Can I talk to you?

29:41.942 --> 29:45.316
Look sheriff says nothing happens
as long as that thing is in here.

29:45.486 --> 29:47.568
- Oh, where's the sheriff?
- It's Sunday.

29:47.738 --> 29:52.573
He's at the church. It's a
mystery, he's not very religious

29:52.783 --> 29:54.508
listen, listen, uh... what
time did you say the

29:54.521 --> 29:56.441
country coroner was coming
to take the stake out?

29:56.537 --> 29:59.040
I didn't say nothing about nothing.

29:59.310 --> 30:02.910
- Um, uh, somebody said it was
this week... somebody said.
- But it wasn't me.

30:02.964 --> 30:05.046
Can I, can I come in?

30:05.216 --> 30:08.840
Okay but look you can't touch anything.
It's all evidence.

30:11.262 --> 30:13.554
Don't touch anything, you got it?

30:15.306 --> 30:19.931
It's my responsibility, and I don't want
that guy yelling at me, I'm sick of it.

30:21.102 --> 30:23.394
- Hello.
- Yeah, can I talk to the sheriff?

30:23.645 --> 30:25.316
Just a minute.

30:26.688 --> 30:28.439
Bobby.

30:30.031 --> 30:31.783
Telephone.

30:35.366 --> 30:40.662
- Yeah.
- Hey sheriff, I got that writer fella
from out of town here at the office.

30:41.292 --> 30:43.585
He doesn't know it's Sunday?

30:44.295 --> 30:46.588
Let me talk to him.

30:47.379 --> 30:49.511
Hey Bobby, it's hall Baltimore.

30:49.671 --> 30:51.629
Yeah I couldn't get your
story and the image

30:51.642 --> 30:53.305
of that poor dead
girl out of my mind.

30:53.515 --> 30:56.518
- Really?
- Yes, I dreamt about it all night.

30:56.768 --> 30:59.141
I'd like to write that book with you.

31:06.318 --> 31:09.281
So, you're the sheriff
and you make bat houses?

31:09.441 --> 31:11.863
Yes, and that's a bird house.

31:12.444 --> 31:14.656
Totally different..

31:14.786 --> 31:17.239
The bats and the birds know which is which.

31:17.870 --> 31:20.702
Well normally I write
about witchcraft but...

31:21.163 --> 31:24.046
What are vampires but
witches that suck blood.

31:24.166 --> 31:26.338
Entirely different.

31:26.458 --> 31:28.550
We haven't really had one here.

31:28.751 --> 31:32.304
There are no witches here, since
as long as I can remember.

31:32.634 --> 31:36.138
I could ask my sister.
She's older than Hades.

31:36.348 --> 31:39.101
Welcome to my office. Come on have a seat.

31:41.353 --> 31:45.227
Imagine this. Written by...

31:45.518 --> 31:49.572
Hall Baltimore and Bobby LaGrange. Sweet.

31:49.732 --> 31:53.025
Or, hall Baltimore with an
idea by Bobby LaGrange.

31:53.155 --> 31:56.829
What do you mean an idea by? I got a
hell of a lot more than an idea by.

31:56.989 --> 31:59.121
- I got a great character.
- Yeah, who?

31:59.282 --> 32:03.586
- Bobby LaGrange.
- Calm` down. Tell me what you got. Shoot.

32:04.086 --> 32:07.340
I call it, the vampire executions...

32:07.880 --> 32:10.173
And that will sell.

32:10.383 --> 32:12.675
Not bad. Go on.

32:13.096 --> 32:17.720
The girl, who is she?
Is she just a runaway?

32:18.471 --> 32:20.803
Or just some 12 or 13 year old girl...

32:20.974 --> 32:23.106
That looks much older than she really is.

32:23.266 --> 32:25.558
A vagrant? Homeless?

32:25.858 --> 32:28.271
- Why the wooden stake?
- Yeah, why?

32:28.401 --> 32:30.693
What, did that kill her?

32:31.064 --> 32:33.526
Or was it something that was added later?

32:33.907 --> 32:36.910
As a calling card for the real killer?

32:39.032 --> 32:42.916
You see, one end of it was worn smooth.

32:44.127 --> 32:46.419
No fingerprints.

32:47.460 --> 32:52.546
And then it was pressed into her... slowly.

32:52.716 --> 32:54.968
Not jab, not stab.

32:55.138 --> 32:59.433
Almost as if it was done by
some kind of a machine.

32:59.643 --> 33:01.725
- A machine?
- Yeah.

33:01.895 --> 33:05.228
That's why I call it the
vampire executions.

33:05.439 --> 33:09.853
I think she was killed by.
..An electric chair...

33:10.233 --> 33:12.526
For vampires.

33:14.818 --> 33:19.993
An execution device, designed
especially by and for vampires.

33:20.164 --> 33:23.707
That's different... I wonder
what that would look like.

33:23.917 --> 33:27.921
Well I thought of that. I made a model.

33:34.218 --> 33:36.300
- Ready?
- Ready

33:36.470 --> 33:38.762
how about that?

33:40.434 --> 33:42.726
Watch this.

33:49.814 --> 33:52.106
You love it?

35:00.055 --> 35:02.267
- How can I help you, Hall.
- Hey Sam...

35:02.327 --> 35:05.670
Remember you said if I come with a
bulletproof idea, you'd give me an advance?

35:05.690 --> 35:07.941
- Another advance.
- Yeah, another, more.

35:08.433 --> 35:11.977
A bulletproof idea comes
with meat on the bone.

35:12.147 --> 35:14.780
Not a lot of fog on the lake
kind of crap, you know.

35:14.940 --> 35:17.983
Yeah, well no one can mix
metaphors quite like you Sam.

35:18.113 --> 35:21.577
Here's the title, right... just
listen the vampire executions.

35:21.737 --> 35:24.039
Vampires huh?

35:24.370 --> 35:27.373
And the main character get this...
She's a little girl, a murdered girl.

35:27.493 --> 35:29.875
- Beautiful.
- Beautiful, yeah, but she's just a kid.

35:29.995 --> 35:32.628
No, no, no, I meant it's beautiful
that she gets murdered.

35:32.798 --> 35:36.342
But it's gotta have a lot of story.
Not a lot of style bullshit.

35:36.752 --> 35:39.755
So tell me, how does this
execution bit play out?

35:39.925 --> 35:44.100
I, I will find out. I, I mean there's
a great... great twist ending.

35:44.140 --> 35:45.010
With heart.

35:45.141 --> 35:47.941
With tons of heart, and I'll get you
a complete outline in the morning.

35:48.064 --> 35:51.897
But you gotta get me a check
to Denise right away.

35:52.068 --> 35:53.225
I'm not kidding around,
in fact, in fact the bank

35:53.238 --> 35:54.360
wire transfer would be better.
It’s an emergency

35:54.520 --> 35:57.023
you know, you know, I'm
thinking, it's not bulletproof.

35:57.193 --> 36:01.697
But hall Baltimore, master of
witchcraft doing a vampire story...

36:01.868 --> 36:04.160
- It's not bad.
- Not bad at all.

36:04.490 --> 36:06.582
- If it's got an ending.
- It's got an ending.

36:06.702 --> 36:08.995
- A bulletproof ending.
- Bulletproof

36:09.916 --> 36:12.498
but Sam, you gotta tide my wife over
okay?

36:12.669 --> 36:16.673
This is why I'm doing it alright?
25 grand.

36:16.843 --> 36:19.926
Okay, you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna wire Denise 10,000 dollars.

36:20.046 --> 36:23.259
25.
That, that's great. I really appreciate it.

36:23.469 --> 36:25.972
As I said, I'm gonna wire
Denise 10,000 dollars...

36:26.102 --> 36:28.975
But I need the outline in the
morning or I'm gonna stop payment.

36:29.145 --> 36:31.808
- Sam?
- And no fog on the lake.

36:47.454 --> 36:50.287
The night was... humid.

36:50.827 --> 36:54.131
The night was... cloudy.

36:54.791 --> 36:59.426
Fog. A mist... A mist descends...

37:00.257 --> 37:05.222
On the, on the lake mini, mini, mini...

37:05.592 --> 37:07.895
Unwanipanuki Lake.

37:08.305 --> 37:12.900
The fog... floated out like

37:14.441 --> 37:17.604
Virginia's silent...

37:21.108 --> 37:23.410
Dream.

37:23.610 --> 37:25.913
No, that sucks.

37:29.206 --> 37:32.419
The fog on the lake, the fog on the...

37:34.712 --> 37:39.256
The fog on the lake...
Just to torture Sam.

37:39.837 --> 37:42.800
The scent floats out like...

37:43.631 --> 37:45.933
Tears.

37:46.764 --> 37:49.226
On a whale's ass? No.

37:50.017 --> 37:56.103
The fog on the lake... the flake.
The straight edge razor.

37:56.944 --> 38:00.778
The fog on the lake reminds me of my
first wife.

38:01.149 --> 38:05.243
It dissipated with time.
I'd lost my mind.

38:05.363 --> 38:07.655
And now I have a lisp.

38:07.825 --> 38:12.040
And now I'm suddenly turning into a
black basketball player.

38:12.540 --> 38:17.165
She... was...

38:18.166 --> 38:23.221
I'm typing as a gay basketball
player from the sixties.

38:23.471 --> 38:25.553
I like short shorts.

38:25.723 --> 38:29.347
They are revealing, but it's comfortable.
It helps me jump.

38:31.309 --> 38:34.272
There was no fog on the lake.

40:43.523 --> 40:46.947
Swann valley, sheriff's department.
Deputy arbus speaking.

40:47.117 --> 40:51.872
Arbus, the writer fella told me to go do
a bunch of errands for him...

40:52.202 --> 40:54.494
Well, he's not back here at his motel.

40:55.325 --> 40:59.209
If you see him, tell him I'll wait
another thirty minutes...

40:59.379 --> 41:04.044
- And that's it... I got to go.
- Alright, sheriff.

41:04.294 --> 41:06.466
Why isn't the door locked, arbus?

41:06.587 --> 41:09.219
Yeah, I left it open for you, pj.

41:10.300 --> 41:12.346
- What happened to your diet?
- I was wondering

41:12.359 --> 41:14.595
when you were gonna get
here with my hamburgers.

41:14.725 --> 41:19.059
Feel like to playing some cards?
Sure, but when are you gonna pay up?

41:22.943 --> 41:25.856
- Hey PJ, get the chord there would you.
- Okay...

41:31.572 --> 41:34.865
Don't ever walk into a morgue
like that unannounced.

41:35.035 --> 41:38.289
- My heart can't handle it.
- Sorry, I knocked.

41:39.420 --> 41:43.174
Yeah, well, sheriff's
over at your motel...

41:43.464 --> 41:46.547
And he said
I'll only be here another thirty minutes.

41:46.797 --> 41:49.090
Okay, thanks.

41:49.550 --> 41:51.842
You owe me eighteen bucks, arbus.

42:12.904 --> 42:17.619
Snooze, ropopose, sleep all...

42:19.080 --> 42:21.704
Night all... and you
didn't put this on your

42:21.717 --> 42:24.295
list. But I liked it. I
thought it was good.

42:24.466 --> 42:26.758
- Sleeping all.
- Just what I needed.

42:30.342 --> 42:33.635
Are we gonna work on this together?
That is, what you said.

42:33.765 --> 42:36.268
These are just gonna put you to sleep.

42:36.978 --> 42:39.271
A chance to dream.

42:40.392 --> 42:43.064
- But you didn't read the label’s.
- Yes I did.

42:49.361 --> 42:53.245
This is how you write? I thought that
all city writers...

42:53.365 --> 42:57.749
- Just got sauced and then
wrote in some kind of trance
- We do... we do but...

42:57.909 --> 43:02.084
There is a bulletproof ending out there
and I know just the guy to get me there...

43:09.711 --> 43:14.556
Hey do you know a doctor in town that can
give me prescription for a real..Real one?

43:14.717 --> 43:17.019
I can't do that. I'm a public official.

43:20.562 --> 43:24.146
Twilight lights. By Bobby LaGrange.

43:27.109 --> 43:30.483
Her skin was as fresh as cream,
floating up from butter...

43:30.653 --> 43:34.987
Under the lace negligee she
liked to tease me with.

44:03.856 --> 44:06.149
What keeps bringing you back here?

44:08.111 --> 44:10.403
I'm trying to solve a mystery.

44:11.524 --> 44:13.826
I'm waiting for you, my friend.

44:15.028 --> 44:17.370
Here, by her tomb.

44:27.540 --> 44:29.843
- After you.
- Thank you.

44:35.348 --> 44:39.603
And you are... Edgar Allan poe,
so..If you...

44:41.605 --> 44:43.897
How can I help?

44:45.268 --> 44:47.561
Well... I don't have no ending.

44:47.731 --> 44:50.944
Did you know the deacons once corresponded
with me...

44:51.114 --> 44:57.531
Concerning the technique... of writing
the ending first. And working backwards.

45:05.329 --> 45:07.461
What did you need? Length?

45:07.631 --> 45:12.676
40 to 50 lines... per page.
200 page minimum.

45:13.387 --> 45:16.090
- Providence?
- Beauty.

45:16.300 --> 45:19.143
- The tone?
- They'll tell you.

45:19.303 --> 45:21.595
These points being settled...

45:22.226 --> 45:24.728
- Shall we consider a reframe?
- I like it.

45:25.479 --> 45:30.314
The bell tower is becoming to me.

45:30.694 --> 45:34.909
A reframe must be brief.
In my own work, my most famous...

45:35.069 --> 45:38.823
It's lead me at once to a single
word is the best... I'm afraid.

45:39.033 --> 45:41.165
Never more.

45:41.325 --> 45:44.248
The difficulty arose from the
presumption that the word...

45:44.368 --> 45:46.621
Must be monopolously be spoken by
a human being.

45:46.791 --> 45:51.796
Then immediately arose the idea of a, a non
reasoning creature capable of speech...

45:51.966 --> 45:55.339
And, then very naturally a
parrot suggested itself.

45:56.431 --> 45:59.183
But it was superceded forthwith immediately
by a raven as equally...

45:59.594 --> 46:03.057
Capable of speech, but as a bird
of ill omen...

46:03.518 --> 46:06.691
Infinitely more in keeping
within intent to turn.

46:08.233 --> 46:11.896
Is all this worth the price of that
very good bottle of Irish whisky?

46:12.317 --> 46:15.320
Yes, of course, please continue..

46:16.901 --> 46:19.204
So, I asked myself...

46:20.405 --> 46:22.747
Of all the melancholy topics...

46:23.458 --> 46:25.760
What according to the
universal understanding

46:25.773 --> 46:27.332
of mankind is the most tragic?

46:28.913 --> 46:31.216
Death.

46:31.586 --> 46:35.800
And when is this most tragic
of melancholy topics...

46:35.971 --> 46:38.053
Most poetical?

46:38.173 --> 46:42.928
When it most loosely alludes
itself... to beauty.

46:44.229 --> 46:47.482
The death therefore,
of a beautiful girl...

46:48.063 --> 46:52.738
Is unquestionably the most poetical
topic in the world.

46:56.902 --> 47:00.616
Equally it is beyond there that the lips
best suited for the topic

47:00.786 --> 47:04.620
are those of the man...
Who loved her.

47:15.050 --> 47:17.923
So... I had to combine these two ideas...

47:18.344 --> 47:20.926
Of the lover lamented his
deceased mistress...

47:21.217 --> 47:24.059
And the raven' continuously using the
word "nevermore"

47:24.220 --> 47:27.103
in a poem of about 100 lines.

47:27.273 --> 47:30.276
And "nevermore" of conclusion
of each dancer...

47:30.436 --> 47:33.029
In a poem of melancholy tone.

47:37.693 --> 47:39.986
How do you uh, find the ending?

47:47.163 --> 47:49.455
Your story is a tragedy.

47:50.666 --> 47:54.500
It happened here at the old
chikering hotel where I once slept.

47:55.631 --> 48:01.177
There were many children in the town.
Orphans some wares, the lost children.

48:02.929 --> 48:07.143
And before long they were taking in
to protection of pastor Alan Floyd.

48:07.724 --> 48:09.315
He was a kindly man, loved his kids.

48:09.896 --> 48:12.979
And everyone agreed that he took
very good care of them.

48:13.069 --> 48:17.614
He taught them cataclysm, and love
of God and goodness.

48:29.626 --> 48:31.918
And one night it happened.

48:32.959 --> 48:36.793
One of his children was missing.
And that's when it came out.

48:38.795 --> 48:41.098
Who isn't here?

48:41.298 --> 48:43.800
Peter?
Where did...

48:44.101 --> 48:46.393
He didn't go across the lake.

49:03.200 --> 49:07.454
Never ever go with the people
across of the lake.

49:09.877 --> 49:15.082
This is very important. They are like,
like, like... vermin.

49:16.043 --> 49:20.928
Unclean, those, those
fiends across the lake.

49:22.139 --> 49:24.431
They are... the undead..

49:25.803 --> 49:28.095
They are vampires.

49:39.947 --> 49:42.240
He took care of them and fed them.

49:42.780 --> 49:45.743
Anointed them with the juices of spoilage,

49:46.664 --> 49:49.457
and sinkfoil and wolfsbane.

49:50.368 --> 49:52.460
Anointed them against evil.

49:52.620 --> 49:54.792
- Turn your head.
- Thank you...

49:58.546 --> 50:01.179
That's right. There we go.

50:02.180 --> 50:06.054
Make sure that you be nice and safe.

50:06.224 --> 50:10.558
Someday you will wearing...
Nylon stockings.

50:47.015 --> 50:50.058
- Where the hell is he?
- What are you doing with
my mom's ouija board?

50:50.269 --> 50:53.932
- Have you ever seen one of these?
- What would you do with that?

50:54.102 --> 51:00.649
Innovation is what made the detective
story and Charlie Chan entertaining.

51:01.740 --> 51:05.574
Bobby LaGrange...
is an innovative detective.

51:06.615 --> 51:08.907
After you, sir.

51:12.581 --> 51:15.915
That, ouija board.

51:16.835 --> 51:19.548
We are in close proximity...

51:20.880 --> 51:23.172
To the deceased.

51:23.552 --> 51:29.468
And the killer is probably still
in the area.

51:30.179 --> 51:32.561
Maybe we shouldn't be doing this
in a morgue.

51:36.355 --> 51:38.648
Dim the old lights..

51:54.414 --> 51:56.706
Hello.

51:58.207 --> 52:02.171
- Do we know you?
- Yes, it is.

52:02.342 --> 52:04.354
You're doing that, I can feel you.

52:04.415 --> 52:07.507
- No I'm not.
- Shut up!

52:08.348 --> 52:12.142
H.. I.. M.

52:12.602 --> 52:14.894
Him.

52:16.316 --> 52:18.608
It wants you

52:32.993 --> 52:35.285
okay, do we know you?

52:37.207 --> 52:39.499
I...

52:39.920 --> 52:43.794
Am... her.

52:46.506 --> 52:48.799
I am.

52:53.684 --> 52:55.976
Arbus, what was that?

53:02.363 --> 53:05.486
Ask her, let go watch.

53:05.616 --> 53:07.908
Who killed you?

53:10.491 --> 53:12.783
B...

53:18.829 --> 53:21.882
- Sheriff, you're doing that. I can feel it.
- Am not.

53:29.180 --> 53:31.472
Who killed you?

53:31.973 --> 53:34.265
B...

53:40.852 --> 53:45.406
The evil kids at the lake.
They are evil.

53:46.567 --> 53:50.201
And that flamingo kid, he's the one
that infects them.

53:50.361 --> 53:54.165
He's a vampire. Is he?

53:54.325 --> 53:56.618
'Yes'.

54:56.678 --> 54:59.181
Come on, arbus. Keep your gun hidden.

55:14.497 --> 55:18.040
- You must be thirsty?
- Exactly.

55:18.200 --> 55:21.293
- I'm looking for Flamingo.
- He is right back here.

55:21.454 --> 55:24.507
When the sky is low and heavy,
weighing as a lid...

55:25.207 --> 55:30.343
On the groaning spirit, falling
prey to long boredom...

55:34.517 --> 55:37.560
Educated.. You know baudelaire.

55:38.181 --> 55:42.185
I know life man. And I know the
dreams of baudelaire.

55:43.566 --> 55:47.190
And he from the horizon, the entire
circle embracing...

55:48.151 --> 55:52.445
A dark day for our poor, even sadder
than the nights.

55:56.159 --> 55:59.542
I was hoping you could help me find
this missing girl.

55:59.582 --> 56:02.125
She is 12 or 13.

56:06.589 --> 56:08.882
There are a lot of girls here.

56:13.847 --> 56:17.681
You know, people are saying what's
going on up here is... evil.

56:18.471 --> 56:20.764
Are you worried about that?

56:20.974 --> 56:24.768
Look around you. Does
this look evil to you?

56:29.232 --> 56:31.525
Look at that moon.

56:33.867 --> 56:36.029
It is beautiful.

56:36.199 --> 56:38.492
I have been worried...

56:39.242 --> 56:41.375
It has been 3 days since we've seen her..

56:41.535 --> 56:43.905
She's just a little kid
that I take care of, but

56:43.918 --> 56:46.250
I'm worried that something
has happened to her.

56:54.798 --> 56:57.101
Arbus. Damn it.

57:13.908 --> 57:18.282
You?
You're out off uniform?

57:18.662 --> 57:22.456
And you're here on unofficial business.
What the hell are you doing here?

57:23.127 --> 57:27.461
He said you were okay with it.
He gave me 20 bucks.

57:30.134 --> 57:32.426
Mr. collaborator.

57:32.837 --> 57:37.892
I thought we were a team,
all the way through this investigation.

57:38.262 --> 57:41.806
Bobby LaGrange does not like
to be tricked.

57:42.647 --> 57:45.350
Nor does he like being made a fool out of.

57:48.272 --> 57:53.358
The famous flamingo
..My..My..My

57:55.450 --> 57:57.742
the lady killer.

58:04.119 --> 58:06.421
Arbus, arrest this murderer.

58:08.173 --> 58:11.676
He's like that... either coming or going.

58:12.087 --> 58:14.379
Or he's already gone.

58:21.636 --> 58:23.836
- Those are the real keys for the...
- These are them...

58:23.939 --> 58:26.021
- These are the official keys.
- Wow, that's amazing.

58:26.141 --> 58:28.984
- This is to the clock tower?
- Yes, really?

58:29.354 --> 58:31.594
Hey give me, give me that.
Where are you going with that?

58:31.646 --> 58:34.359
- Come on, just to see.
- What? You don't want to go up there.

59:09.525 --> 59:12.027
That's odd, I was up here yesterday...

59:12.118 --> 59:16.322
- And I didn't have a hard time
with this lock at all.
- Yesterday?

59:16.492 --> 59:18.784
Uh, maybe it was last week.

59:20.786 --> 59:23.499
- It worked?
- Maybe it was the week before last.

59:23.869 --> 59:26.162
Let me try.

59:28.164 --> 59:30.456
- Here.
- Thanks.

59:47.353 --> 59:49.646
What the hell was that?

59:53.610 --> 59:56.533
You tell me you ever notice anything
like that when you were up here?

59:56.733 --> 01:00:00.947
You're not going up there. This place
is haunted. Didn't you know that?

01:00:01.157 --> 01:00:03.239
- What's that smell?
- The devil.

01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:05.542
The devil lives up there.

01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:08.835
You're gonna get it all over yourself.
I'm going out.

01:00:09.546 --> 01:00:11.838
Goodbye.

01:00:44.371 --> 01:00:48.916
Come with us daddy...
Come with us daddy

01:00:49.376 --> 01:00:52.339
help me, daddy...
Come with us daddy.

01:00:52.539 --> 01:00:54.631
Help me...
Help me... daddy

01:01:31.709 --> 01:01:34.001
- Listen,
- What is that?

01:02:16.254 --> 01:02:18.547
Are they evil?

01:02:19.468 --> 01:02:21.760
No.

01:02:22.761 --> 01:02:25.053
No.

01:02:25.684 --> 01:02:30.729
Tell me who killed her?
Tell me.

01:02:31.770 --> 01:02:34.102
You say that you want to know..
But do you?

01:02:34.313 --> 01:02:36.895
- I want to know the truth.
- There are consequences.

01:02:37.776 --> 01:02:40.068
What choice do I have?

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:45.994
- Tell me all of the story.
- As you wish, my friend.

01:02:46.745 --> 01:02:51.080
There happened events just make
you ashamed to remember.

01:02:54.333 --> 01:02:58.257
- Please.
- Thank you, it's a sharp of knife.

01:03:00.509 --> 01:03:02.631
I wanna know what the secret ingredient is.

01:03:02.801 --> 01:03:06.015
We're going to have special lemonade
for everybody.

01:03:08.517 --> 01:03:12.271
That's right... good job.

01:03:12.281 --> 01:03:14.774
- This stuff stinks.
- Careful.

01:03:16.185 --> 01:03:18.487
You cut your finger.

01:03:26.115 --> 01:03:28.498
- Here you go, Alice.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:03:28.748 --> 01:03:31.040
There you go.

01:03:38.007 --> 01:03:42.091
Wait. Don't drink the lemonade,
he put something in it.

01:03:43.012 --> 01:03:45.635
- No, stop.
- No I would like lemonade, Virginia

01:03:45.805 --> 01:03:50.139
Virginia, fine. Enough,
..Stand still.

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:53.273
Virginia, is being very...
Very sick.

01:03:53.433 --> 01:03:56.593
And we're all going to have some lemonade,
it's delicious and sweet... taste it.

01:04:05.735 --> 01:04:09.910
- Stay... stay... stay here.
- What are you doing?

01:04:11.041 --> 01:04:13.793
Then he made a fateful decision.

01:04:15.125 --> 01:04:18.959
Rather than have his children's
souls be damned as vampires

01:04:19.549 --> 01:04:23.093
he drugged their lemonade, and slit
their throats.

01:04:33.604 --> 01:04:38.939
Can you make him stop?
Do something..

01:04:49.119 --> 01:04:51.412
Death of beauty.

01:04:57.668 --> 01:05:00.711
One child tried to save herself.

01:05:02.883 --> 01:05:05.176
Virginia?

01:05:08.008 --> 01:05:10.301
You're playing our favorite game, huh?

01:05:11.972 --> 01:05:14.265
I'll find you.

01:05:24.615 --> 01:05:26.908
Got you.

01:05:35.326 --> 01:05:37.628
Virginia.

01:05:56.307 --> 01:05:59.270
Virginia.

01:07:12.134 --> 01:07:14.557
One way to God.

01:07:14.847 --> 01:07:19.061
One, one, one way to God.

01:07:59.893 --> 01:08:02.185
I got you.

01:08:03.857 --> 01:08:07.691
Once the monster caught her he put her
in chains in the vault.

01:08:12.616 --> 01:08:14.908
No.

01:08:19.993 --> 01:08:22.295
You must stop screaming.

01:08:22.496 --> 01:08:25.749
I told you... God wants you to meet mom.

01:08:32.135 --> 01:08:34.638
That's right. Scream all what you want,

01:08:35.759 --> 01:08:38.060
even God can't hear you now.

01:09:17.602 --> 01:09:21.975
One road, one way to God..

01:09:22.687 --> 01:09:26.691
One road, one way to God...

01:09:33.448 --> 01:09:36.029
All in Jesus name.

01:09:56.261 --> 01:10:00.895
During the brightest days of her
unparalleled beauty... I loved her..

01:10:01.266 --> 01:10:03.979
Not as the living and
breathing Virginia...

01:10:04.099 --> 01:10:06.401
But as the Virginia of the dream.

01:10:18.163 --> 01:10:20.455
You see...

01:10:20.956 --> 01:10:23.248
Dear friend...

01:10:24.079 --> 01:10:27.252
She was my young cousin...

01:10:29.875 --> 01:10:32.177
My beloved wife.

01:10:33.799 --> 01:10:36.091
Her name was Virginia.

01:10:36.762 --> 01:10:39.054
But I gave her many names.

01:10:39.635 --> 01:10:41.937
Lenor

01:10:42.558 --> 01:10:44.850
bernice.

01:10:46.191 --> 01:10:50.195
The lady gaia.
Madenasha.

01:10:50.396 --> 01:10:52.488
Annabelle Lee.

01:10:52.648 --> 01:10:54.950
Alianora.

01:11:47.043 --> 01:11:50.877
I assume that I am your
partner?...Open the door, wake up.

01:11:52.208 --> 01:11:54.511
Wake up.

01:11:56.303 --> 01:11:59.095
- Open the door, hall.
- Alright, alright... Hang on.

01:12:02.719 --> 01:12:05.021
- Wait 'til you see this.
- What?

01:12:07.724 --> 01:12:09.856
I subscribed to "writers weekly."

01:12:10.026 --> 01:12:12.109
And this just in...

01:12:12.279 --> 01:12:14.875
Says that you took a
10,000 dollar advance on

01:12:14.888 --> 01:12:17.324
a project called "the
vampire executions."

01:12:17.534 --> 01:12:21.328
No, no.. That was money
for some old writes.

01:12:21.488 --> 01:12:24.371
And that money already went to my wife.
That's a mistake.

01:12:24.541 --> 01:12:29.797
But I was thinking, I do like
"the vampire executions"...

01:12:29.837 --> 01:12:32.920
By hall Baltimore and Bobby LaGrange.

01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:35.883
Give me my $5,000 dollar now.

01:12:36.213 --> 01:12:39.176
There's not gonna be any money exchanged
until we get to the story right?

01:12:39.346 --> 01:12:41.849
- We gotta get to the end.
- The end?

01:12:42.179 --> 01:12:45.842
The end? It's a who done it.
Like every other murder mystery.

01:12:45.892 --> 01:12:48.185
- Just let me wake up.
- It comes to who did it.

01:12:48.355 --> 01:12:50.477
- Okay.
- What's the matter with you?

01:12:50.648 --> 01:12:53.941
- You're foregoing your greatest asset.
- Yeah... What's that?

01:12:54.151 --> 01:12:56.574
Bobby LaGrange, the detective..

01:12:57.074 --> 01:13:00.618
You gotta take Bobby LaGrange and use him
much more throughout the entire story...

01:13:00.738 --> 01:13:03.531
Because he could solve the crime himself..

01:13:03.661 --> 01:13:06.494
Clearly it's the work of a serial killer.

01:13:06.664 --> 01:13:10.668
Someone wants to silence the girls,
on the other side of the lake.

01:13:10.838 --> 01:13:13.881
Because, they fried a sick mind.

01:13:14.592 --> 01:13:19.797
And then they sizzle them, because of
some psycho hocus pocus condition...

01:13:20.098 --> 01:13:23.681
That condemns them to being the evil sluts
that they are.

01:13:23.851 --> 01:13:26.934
And that is what's in a sick mind.

01:13:29.477 --> 01:13:33.902
You think so, Bobby?
You think they're uh, they're evil sluts?

01:13:34.062 --> 01:13:36.274
- Whom?
- The young girls.

01:13:36.404 --> 01:13:40.778
Shit yes, they're all into dark things...

01:13:40.819 --> 01:13:43.872
Every one of them they worship death...
And sex.

01:13:45.874 --> 01:13:48.166
What do you think?

01:13:51.539 --> 01:13:55.133
Oh no you don't...

01:13:55.333 --> 01:13:57.636
No, not Bobby LaGrange...
Them.

01:13:58.386 --> 01:14:01.389
Those devil worshiping whores
on the other side of the loch.

01:14:05.263 --> 01:14:10.399
Shit yes, they are all in dark thing every
one of them. They worship death and sex.

01:14:11.309 --> 01:14:14.102
They were just too saucy for
their own good.

01:14:15.484 --> 01:14:19.358
You know, they have that white flash
with the devil inside them.

01:14:25.324 --> 01:14:28.537
That little spice you can't stop,
thinking about.

01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:33.322
- It's not me.
- It's not me.

01:14:33.342 --> 01:14:35.714
- It's them.
- It's them...

01:14:35.834 --> 01:14:37.926
Flash of the devil.

01:14:40.129 --> 01:14:42.301
I saved their souls.

01:14:43.882 --> 01:14:46.015
You...

01:14:46.185 --> 01:14:48.267
You don't touch me.

01:14:48.437 --> 01:14:51.140
Do not touch me. Tearing it out.

01:14:51.170 --> 01:14:54.103
- Old bastard.
- Forgive me...

01:14:54.273 --> 01:14:58.067
Forgive me for seeking
pleasure outside of the company...

01:14:58.948 --> 01:15:03.703
Cast me another way for my spirit.

01:15:04.283 --> 01:15:08.247
Perhaps, it takes the dirt to be boiled,
only here alone?

01:15:08.537 --> 01:15:11.791
With all of these things together,
thrown...

01:15:20.430 --> 01:15:24.514
- Burn it... she shall...
- Flame-proof, bullet-proof.

01:15:55.505 --> 01:15:59.880
I can't even look at the cliff,
without trembling.

01:16:02.092 --> 01:16:04.384
This little cliff?

01:16:11.431 --> 01:16:13.724
Wait, wait.

01:16:20.821 --> 01:16:25.285
- Do you dare to go further?
- What are you talking about,
tell me the ending.

01:16:25.445 --> 01:16:27.578
If you don't stop now, every word

01:16:27.738 --> 01:16:31.081
that flows from your pen
will be your your own tale.

01:16:31.992 --> 01:16:35.956
You.
You are the ending you seek.

01:16:37.127 --> 01:16:40.130
How can I stop now when it's
so close to the end?

01:16:41.252 --> 01:16:43.554
Then it's time to face the truth.

01:16:44.805 --> 01:16:48.599
To end this story, there is no other way.

01:17:14.415 --> 01:17:18.459
I am so ashamed, I should cry
that's my little girl.

01:17:19.130 --> 01:17:23.004
That's my daughter. She wanted me
to go with her friends.

01:17:23.174 --> 01:17:25.506
I thought they were little boats...

01:17:25.677 --> 01:17:29.010
I thought they were childrens boats.
I didn't know they were speedboats.

01:17:33.014 --> 01:17:37.188
I couldn't guide them. I was
too drunk to wake up that morning.

01:17:40.482 --> 01:17:42.774
I was with a woman.

01:17:44.866 --> 01:17:47.158
I am so ashamed.

01:17:49.701 --> 01:17:52.454
I could have gone,
i set the clock,

01:17:52.824 --> 01:17:56.037
but it was the wrong time so the alarm
didn't go off.

01:18:01.583 --> 01:18:03.885
I could have been there... but

01:18:05.797 --> 01:18:09.141
been there, maybe still...

01:18:11.803 --> 01:18:14.096
I'm so ashamed...

01:18:14.896 --> 01:18:17.019
So ashamed.

01:18:17.189 --> 01:18:20.022
Than maybe if I would have been there
she would...

01:18:22.855 --> 01:18:27.199
I could have been there,
i should have been there.

01:18:29.912 --> 01:18:31.784
This little girl.

01:18:42.424 --> 01:18:46.008
We share this little ghost,
my friend.

01:18:47.470 --> 01:18:53.265
Our work must be the grave that we
prepare for it's lovely tenant.

01:20:12.716 --> 01:20:15.018
Oh God...

01:21:32.597 --> 01:21:35.550
Help me... help me, daddy..

01:22:42.748 --> 01:22:45.541
'Bullet proof'.
You delivered the goods here.

01:22:45.671 --> 01:22:48.504
I'm telling you, meat on
the bone.

01:22:48.964 --> 01:22:51.257
- You think so, Sam?
- I do.

01:22:53.049 --> 01:22:56.632
Hall Baltimore,
master of witchcraft, no more.

01:22:57.633 --> 01:22:59.936
Never more.
