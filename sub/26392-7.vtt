WEBVTT

00:04.134 --> 00:07.007
Hey, Cooper,
what's with the getup?

00:07.050 --> 00:09.618
Hmm? Oh, got a, uh... a lot of
crazy fans out there, Claire.

00:09.661 --> 00:11.141
I need to keep
a low profile.

00:11.185 --> 00:13.752
You look like Helen Mirren

00:13.796 --> 00:16.016
playing in
the World Series of Poker.

00:16.059 --> 00:17.887
[chuckles]

00:17.930 --> 00:20.150
And why are you in disguise?

00:20.194 --> 00:23.066
Huh?

00:23.110 --> 00:27.375
Are you worried about being
mobbed by accountant groupies?

00:27.418 --> 00:30.856
Uh, they're called
number sluts.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.510
And really, I'm just trying
to protect myself

00:32.554 --> 00:34.077
from the paparazzi.

00:34.121 --> 00:36.253
Because people are starting to
recognize me as Cooper's friend.

00:36.297 --> 00:38.299
Any time we're out,
they're like, "Cooper, Jake,

00:38.342 --> 00:40.649
Cooper, Jake."

00:40.692 --> 00:45.480
Are you sure they're not saying
"Cooper James"?

00:45.523 --> 00:49.005
I suppose that's
a possibility.

00:49.049 --> 00:52.704
So good to be out in public
amongst regular people.

00:52.748 --> 00:54.445
Or as I call them, reg-pers.

00:54.489 --> 00:56.665
Sorry, what?

00:56.708 --> 00:58.232
Reg-pers.Ooh, boy, with your accent,

00:58.275 --> 01:00.190
you got to be careful
saying that word.

01:00.234 --> 01:02.366
Don't worry, man.

01:02.410 --> 01:05.021
If any of these reg-pers harass
you, there will be two sounds:

01:05.065 --> 01:06.892
them asking you
for an autograph,

01:06.936 --> 01:09.808
and me saying,
"Now's not the time."

01:09.852 --> 01:11.854
Oh, you mean the same
two sounds that you heard

01:11.897 --> 01:14.161
when you met LeBron James
at that urinal?

01:14.204 --> 01:17.947
Going for the handshake
was a mistake.

01:17.990 --> 01:22.517
Hiya. Um, could I get
a croissant and a flat white?

01:22.560 --> 01:23.953
[Australian accent]:
Croissant and a flat white.

01:23.996 --> 01:25.041
Coming right up, mate.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.217
Oh, my God.
A fellow Aussie.

01:27.261 --> 01:29.219
Uh, what part of Australia
are you from?

01:29.263 --> 01:30.525
[American accent]:
Orange County.

01:30.568 --> 01:31.700
[laughs softly]

01:31.743 --> 01:32.875
Oh.
Sorry.

01:32.918 --> 01:34.311
I just thought your
accent was cute.

01:34.355 --> 01:35.530
[both laugh]

01:35.573 --> 01:37.227
So what brings you
to the States?

01:37.271 --> 01:40.230
Uh, uh, music.

01:40.274 --> 01:43.842
Oh, cool. And what
do you do for money?

01:44.887 --> 01:47.890
Uh, yeah-- also music?

01:52.024 --> 01:53.330
Was that in slow-motion?

01:53.374 --> 01:54.592
[laughs]

01:56.377 --> 01:59.249
Guys, this-this cute barista
has no idea who I am.

01:59.293 --> 02:02.122
This is amazing.

02:02.165 --> 02:05.342
Well, not for us. We're gonna
have to pay for our coffee now.

02:06.474 --> 02:07.475
Go talk to her, dude.

02:07.518 --> 02:09.172
Yeah. Yeah.Yeah.

02:09.216 --> 02:12.088
Um... um...

02:12.132 --> 02:14.438
Uh, uh, what brought you
to the States?

02:14.482 --> 02:16.658
Um, birth.

02:18.138 --> 02:21.228
Cool. Yeah, cool.
Um, I was born, too.

02:21.271 --> 02:23.055
Uh...

02:23.099 --> 02:25.232
C-section.

02:26.276 --> 02:28.104
Cool.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.279
Uh...

02:30.933 --> 02:32.500
Guys, how come when I talk,

02:32.543 --> 02:35.633
charming, funny things
aren't coming out?

02:35.677 --> 02:39.246
Uh, maybe try talking about
other surgeries your mom's had.

02:39.289 --> 02:40.464
[laughs]

02:41.900 --> 02:43.598
Do not do that. No.No, don't do that.

02:44.642 --> 02:48.211
♪ Imagine me and you, I do

02:48.255 --> 02:50.866
♪ I think about you
day and night ♪

02:50.909 --> 02:52.607
♪ It's only right

02:52.650 --> 02:55.305
♪ So happy together

02:55.349 --> 02:57.438
[vocalizing]

03:09.058 --> 03:11.408
That barista was so cute,
and she was into you.

03:11.452 --> 03:12.583
Why didn't you ask her out?

03:12.627 --> 03:13.758
Uh...Uh, 'cause we're
happily married.

03:13.802 --> 03:15.978
And, yep, you meant him.

03:18.763 --> 03:20.287
I don't know.

03:20.330 --> 03:22.158
I don't know,
she didn't know who I was,

03:22.202 --> 03:24.247
and I think it...
I think it threw me.

03:24.291 --> 03:26.336
Ah, I got to say,
it was kind of refreshing

03:26.380 --> 03:28.251
to watch you be so awkward,
'cause you're usually

03:28.295 --> 03:29.948
the most confident guy
in the room.

03:29.992 --> 03:31.080
JAKE [chuckles]:
Don't you mean

03:31.123 --> 03:33.125
second most confi...

03:39.349 --> 03:41.569
Usually, when I meet people,
they already know who I am.

03:41.612 --> 03:43.353
And then they ask me what
my latest project is,

03:43.397 --> 03:45.007
and then they show a clip
from that latest project.

03:45.050 --> 03:46.400
Do you only have conversations

03:46.443 --> 03:49.272
when you're appearing
on talk shows?

03:50.578 --> 03:53.581
That actually reminds me
of a funny story. I, uh...

03:56.540 --> 03:58.586
Oh, this explains why,
the first month you lived here,

03:58.629 --> 04:01.328
you kept thanking us
for "having you on."

04:04.113 --> 04:06.028
I've been famous
since I was a kid,

04:06.071 --> 04:08.335
so I guess I've never had
the chance to ask out

04:08.378 --> 04:09.858
a reg-per who thinks
I'm a reg-per, too.

04:09.901 --> 04:12.208
Hmm.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.775
Really think
you're gonna have to start

04:13.818 --> 04:16.299
hitting that "G" harder.

04:16.343 --> 04:18.910
Well, I... I don't
want to mess this up.

04:18.954 --> 04:21.652
You know? What if this girl ends
up being the Claire to my Jake?

04:21.696 --> 04:24.351
Ha, ha, Cooper.
You got a lot of work to do

04:24.394 --> 04:26.483
if you want to be anybody's
Jake, you know what I'm...

04:26.527 --> 04:28.485
Oh, my...

04:28.529 --> 04:31.923
Why do we have
all these magazines?

04:31.967 --> 04:34.056
Stop.

04:34.099 --> 04:38.756
See, you guys have
the perfect reg-perromance.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.628
How do... how do people do that?

04:40.671 --> 04:42.717
You know, I don't even know
how you guys got together.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.022
In college.

04:44.066 --> 04:47.069
[scoffs]
"In college"?

04:47.112 --> 04:48.984
"In college"?

04:49.027 --> 04:50.594
Are you seriously

04:50.638 --> 04:53.510
summing up the greatest love
story of all time in two words?

04:56.121 --> 04:57.688
How do you explain
Romeo and Juliet?

04:57.732 --> 04:59.908
"Dead teenagers"?

05:01.692 --> 05:04.521
Cooper, let me tell you
what actually happened.

05:04.565 --> 05:07.698
It was a crisp fall day
in New Hampshire,

05:07.742 --> 05:11.354
and a young doe-eyed freshman
named Claire was struggling

05:11.398 --> 05:14.618
to move her furniture
into her dorm.

05:15.793 --> 05:17.795
[grunting]

05:21.538 --> 05:23.497
Hey, girl.

05:23.540 --> 05:25.499
Hey.

05:25.542 --> 05:28.458
Can't spell "futon"
without F-U-N.

05:30.634 --> 05:32.375
But moving them sure isn't.

05:32.419 --> 05:34.856
[both laugh]

05:34.899 --> 05:37.772
I'm Jake Davis. Allow me.

05:40.731 --> 05:42.777
[grunts]

05:42.820 --> 05:44.822
Peace.

05:46.911 --> 05:48.348
CLAIRE [laughing]:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:48.391 --> 05:49.653
Jake, come on.

05:49.697 --> 05:52.308
That's not exactly
what happened.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.049
Okay, he had
just finished a ride,

05:54.092 --> 05:56.051
but it wasn't on a motorcycle.

05:57.095 --> 06:00.272
[humming]

06:00.316 --> 06:02.144
Hey, girl.

06:03.275 --> 06:04.538
Hey.

06:04.581 --> 06:08.411
Can't spell "Davis"
without "fun."

06:08.455 --> 06:10.326
I'm Jake Futon.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.414
What?

06:11.458 --> 06:13.547
What? I don't... Allow me.

06:23.861 --> 06:25.254
Well, remember how you want.

06:25.297 --> 06:27.430
I clearly had game,
because Claire started coming

06:27.474 --> 06:29.345
to all of my basketball
practices.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.087
Yeah, 'cause the gym was
the hottest place on campus.

06:32.130 --> 06:33.784
Yeah, it was.

06:33.828 --> 06:35.438
I mean, literally,

06:35.482 --> 06:37.962
'cause I had just moved from
California to New Hampshire,

06:38.006 --> 06:42.010
where summer basically lasts
from July 4 to July 8.

06:42.053 --> 06:45.056
But that week, though.
[laughs]

06:45.100 --> 06:48.059
Ladies be showing some skin.

06:49.321 --> 06:50.801
From roughly the ankle
to mid-calf.Yeah.

06:51.715 --> 06:54.065
Anyways, I...

06:54.109 --> 06:57.895
I made the triumphant
decision to ask Claire out.

06:57.939 --> 06:59.331
CLAIRE:
Yeah, you did.

06:59.375 --> 07:00.942
A month later.

07:00.985 --> 07:02.334
Damn it, Claire.

07:02.378 --> 07:04.206
Well, I'm sorry, babe,
but you're doing that thing

07:04.249 --> 07:06.295
where you edit the story to try
and make it sound better.

07:06.338 --> 07:09.820
Come on, guys.
I want all the details.

07:09.864 --> 07:12.301
How come it took you
so long to get together?

07:12.344 --> 07:14.346
Well, you know,
Claire wasn't exactly

07:14.390 --> 07:16.131
the most approachable
in college.

07:16.174 --> 07:18.699
'Cause I wasn't exactly
having a good time.

07:18.742 --> 07:20.570
What? How can you not
have fun at college?

07:20.614 --> 07:22.485
You go there, thousands of girls
scream your name,

07:22.529 --> 07:24.008
you get an honorary degree.

07:26.794 --> 07:30.188
It's probably different
for other people, isn't it?

07:30.232 --> 07:33.278
Anyway, it was parents weekend.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.368
Oh, honey, don't cry.

07:36.412 --> 07:39.197
Everyone gains weight
their freshman year.

07:39.241 --> 07:40.590
Mom, I didn't gain weight.

07:40.634 --> 07:43.463
Oh. Is it your
bad haircut?

07:44.551 --> 07:46.335
What's wrong with my hair?

07:46.378 --> 07:47.554
Don't worry, Claire.

07:47.597 --> 07:50.208
We can fix the weight,
the hair, the wardrobe.

07:50.252 --> 07:52.297
What? No, I'm upset
because I'm homesick.

07:52.341 --> 07:54.430
Ugh, it's just, it's...

07:54.474 --> 07:56.171
it's freezing here,

07:56.214 --> 07:59.261
everyone puts maple syrup
on everything,

07:59.304 --> 08:02.656
and the radiator melted my Uggs.

08:02.699 --> 08:04.527
For starters, if it's cold,

08:04.571 --> 08:07.182
you can just put on
one of these extra coats.

08:07.225 --> 08:09.140
Dad, that's my roommate.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.883
I'm Hannah, from Florida.

08:15.059 --> 08:17.540
Look, you just need to go
out there and make some friends,

08:17.584 --> 08:19.847
you know, who-who don't
drink or do drugs,

08:19.890 --> 08:21.805
because we will be
testing your urine.

08:23.415 --> 08:24.547
Ooh, Claire.

08:24.591 --> 08:27.550
What about introducing
yourself to that guy?

08:27.594 --> 08:30.379
Oh...Come on, he's cute.

08:30.422 --> 08:33.556
Ooh, and he's on
the basketball team.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.123
Yeah, oh, hi.

08:35.166 --> 08:36.516
Hi. Come meet Claire.

08:36.559 --> 08:38.126
Come meet Claire.
I'm her mother,

08:38.169 --> 08:40.781
so you know she's only
gonna get hotter with age.

08:40.824 --> 08:42.957
[both laugh]

08:43.000 --> 08:44.219
You are cute.

08:44.262 --> 08:45.437
[whoops]

08:45.481 --> 08:46.482
[laughing]:
Sorry.

08:46.526 --> 08:47.875
COOPER:
Whoa.

08:47.918 --> 08:49.398
Uh, who is that guy?

08:49.441 --> 08:51.313
Tommy Barlow.

08:51.356 --> 08:54.577
The hotshot freshman who
stole my playing time.

08:54.621 --> 08:56.666
Thought he was better than me
because he scored more points,

08:56.710 --> 08:59.756
had more assists
and more rebounds than I did.

09:02.367 --> 09:04.761
He was also my first
college boyfriend.

09:04.805 --> 09:06.502
You know,
even though Jake

09:06.546 --> 09:08.504
is the absolute
love of my life,

09:08.548 --> 09:11.594
any time I mention Tommy Barlow,
he still gets mad.

09:11.638 --> 09:13.683
No, I don't.

09:13.727 --> 09:15.598
I don't get mad.

09:15.642 --> 09:17.469
You do seem a little bit upset.

09:17.513 --> 09:20.342
[laughs]:
I am not upset, all right?

09:20.385 --> 09:22.300
Gonna take a little more
than that to make me upset.

09:22.344 --> 09:24.085
You know what I'm saying?

09:24.128 --> 09:25.739
He just had a sample.
I got the whole thing.

09:25.782 --> 09:27.305
You know what I'm saying?

09:27.349 --> 09:29.699
Ain't nothing gonna
make me upset. You know?

09:29.743 --> 09:31.309
[laughs]

09:31.353 --> 09:35.444
I hate you, Tommy Barlow!

09:45.149 --> 09:46.542
Wow. I guess I just assumed

09:46.586 --> 09:48.631
you guys started dating
as soon as you met.

09:48.675 --> 09:50.590
You know, like,
love at first sight.

09:50.633 --> 09:52.374
Oh, that only happens
in the movies.

09:52.417 --> 09:54.637
Eh, it happens in
real life, too.

09:55.769 --> 09:58.685
Your parents fell in love
with Tommy Barlow right away.

09:58.728 --> 10:00.643
[laughs]

10:00.687 --> 10:03.646
So how'd you get Claire?Mm, just played it cool, man.

10:03.690 --> 10:06.649
Played it so cool, I needed
a Zamboni to get out of bed.

10:06.693 --> 10:10.784
[laughs]

10:10.827 --> 10:12.742
[coughing]

10:12.786 --> 10:14.831
[coughs]:
Oh!

10:14.875 --> 10:16.920
Oh, no, sorry,
I was just choking.

10:16.964 --> 10:18.182
[chuckles]

10:18.226 --> 10:19.619
On that lie.

10:22.012 --> 10:24.014
Ah, here's what I remember.

10:28.845 --> 10:30.804
Hey, gir...

10:30.847 --> 10:33.633
Hey, Jake. What's up?

10:33.676 --> 10:35.417
Tommy Barlow.

10:35.460 --> 10:38.159
Guess Claire set the bar low.

10:40.465 --> 10:41.902
These are for your mom.

10:43.773 --> 10:44.992
Peace.

10:46.820 --> 10:49.692
Huh. I guess back then,
Rollerblades were much cooler

10:49.736 --> 10:51.868
in America
than they were in Australia.

10:53.478 --> 10:55.437
They were not.Nope.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.700
Hey, guys.CLAIRE: Hey, what are
you guys doing here?

10:57.744 --> 10:59.484
We need to borrow a few things.

10:59.528 --> 11:02.705
We... we want to make brownies,
but we don't have

11:02.749 --> 11:06.491
any cocoa, flour,
butter, sugar or eggs.

11:07.884 --> 11:10.931
So you just have
the marijuana, then.

11:10.974 --> 11:12.149
That's right, yeah.Yep.

11:12.193 --> 11:13.324
CLAIRE:
Yeah.

11:13.368 --> 11:14.891
Man, what happened
to the parents

11:14.935 --> 11:16.980
who used to drug-test me
in college?

11:17.024 --> 11:20.462
Claire, they're prescription
brownies for my glaucoma.

11:22.594 --> 11:24.074
These two were telling me
how they met at Dartmouth.

11:24.118 --> 11:26.511
[gasps] Oh, Claire
hated it there.

11:26.555 --> 11:28.949
She had the worst haircut.

GERALD: You know,
she hated it so much,

11:30.646 --> 11:32.735

to transfer.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.345
Really? What changed your mind?

11:34.389 --> 11:37.653
Ya boy did.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.003
You see, Cooper,
the fates aligned

11:40.047 --> 11:41.831
one beautiful
New Hampshire evening.

11:42.876 --> 11:44.921
CLAIRE [hisses]:

[deep, bellowing voice]:
But you haven't even
gotten to know me yet.

11:57.978 --> 12:00.894
That was my
New Hampshire voice.

my Texas voice?

Hey, y'all, my
toast is thick.

12:07.074 --> 12:09.337
Well, what are we looking for?

12:09.380 --> 12:11.513
Ugh, my transfer application.

12:11.556 --> 12:12.862
Why the heck
do you want to transfer?

12:12.906 --> 12:14.821
Oh, I'll show you why.

12:15.865 --> 12:17.388

Oh.

12:17.432 --> 12:22.742
It's so cold here, my hair
is literally cracking in half.

12:22.785 --> 12:26.876
[groans] I miss my friends,
and it's always snowing.

12:26.920 --> 12:30.140
Now I know why they make you
take the tour in the spring.

12:30.184 --> 12:32.882
But there's so many fun things
to do in the snow.

12:32.926 --> 12:37.626
Right? You got skiing,
snowball fights,

you really have to go.

that was just over there?

12:46.330 --> 12:47.854
Mind your wizness.

12:47.897 --> 12:51.074
Plus, we are in
the perfect spot

12:51.118 --> 12:53.903
to watch unsuspecting freshmen
slip on that patch of black ice.

12:53.947 --> 12:56.297
JAKE:
Oh, oh...

12:56.340 --> 12:57.559

one for fall.

A fun beverage.
Hold, please.

Oh, I-I actually have
a pact with my parents

13:30.113 --> 13:32.376
that the three of us
will never drink or do drugs.

13:32.420 --> 13:34.857
It's just Gatorade.

13:34.901 --> 13:36.380
Oh. [chuckles]
Yeah.

13:36.424 --> 13:37.817
And...

13:37.860 --> 13:39.819
get some ice, right?

13:39.862 --> 13:43.126
And then pour some of this
on that bad boy.

13:43.170 --> 13:45.085
Voilà. Instant snow cone.

13:45.128 --> 13:47.217
[laughs]

13:47.261 --> 13:48.740
Mm.

13:48.784 --> 13:50.742
So, is this what you do?

13:50.786 --> 13:52.832
You put a magical spin
on everything?

13:52.875 --> 13:55.138
Well, the way I look at it,
life's either gonna be

13:55.182 --> 13:56.879
a great time or a great story.

13:56.923 --> 13:58.925
Sometimes it ends up being both.

13:58.968 --> 14:00.796
Hmm.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.363
[laughs softly]

14:02.406 --> 14:04.931
Luke, uh, what's about to happen
to this architecture student

14:04.974 --> 14:06.497
who can't see
over his model.

14:06.541 --> 14:08.760
CLAIRE: Oh!Oh!

14:08.804 --> 14:10.937
Oh, he just King Kong'd
his own building.

if I make myself a refill?

14:21.121 --> 14:23.950
Oh, sure. Got some
more Gatorade for you.

14:23.993 --> 14:26.169
Hey.

14:26.213 --> 14:28.563

Oh, no, you didn't.

14:28.606 --> 14:29.825
I hope you're ready
to eat another snow cone.

14:29.869 --> 14:30.870
Nope!

JAKE: Claire's first snowball
fight led to our first date.

14:42.751 --> 14:46.363
It, uh, snowballed
from there.

14:46.407 --> 14:48.931
And the rest is kisstory.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.237

Aw.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.500
That's the most romantic story
I've ever heard.

14:52.543 --> 14:54.415
Except for the part
where she broke his nose.

14:54.458 --> 14:55.982
What?

14:56.025 --> 14:58.636
All right, all right.
Come on, come on.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.638
Shouldn't you guys be
in front of a 7-Eleven

15:00.682 --> 15:02.902

15:02.945 --> 15:07.471
Tommy Barlow would never
kick us out of the house.

15:07.515 --> 15:09.082
[door closes]

Okay, fine. I'll admit.

15:11.127 --> 15:13.608
The kiss didn't
quite happen that day.

15:13.651 --> 15:15.740
I don't want to
offend you, but, uh,

15:15.784 --> 15:18.004
you throw snowballs
like a Californian.
Oh, no.

15:18.047 --> 15:19.962

15:20.006 --> 15:23.705
Oh! Yeah? One who played varsity
softball for four years,

15:23.748 --> 15:24.706
so get ready.

15:24.749 --> 15:25.925
[laughs]:
Yeah, right.

15:28.144 --> 15:29.754
Are you okay?

15:29.798 --> 15:32.496
Yeah, yeah. I think it just
hit my nose a little bit. I...

15:32.540 --> 15:33.845
[screams]

15:33.889 --> 15:35.543
Oh, my...

15:35.586 --> 15:37.893
Oh, my God, that's
a lot of blood.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.983
Yeah, um, I'm not good
with s-seeing... bl...

15:41.027 --> 15:43.333
What?

15:43.377 --> 15:45.857
Hey, Claire?

15:45.901 --> 15:48.077
While you're down there,
can you look for my tooth?

15:50.079 --> 15:51.037
Were you okay?

15:51.080 --> 15:53.256
I was, uh, until
Jake tried

15:53.300 --> 15:55.737
to carry me
to the doctor

15:55.780 --> 15:59.262
but slipped on the ice
and gave me a concussion.

16:01.308 --> 16:02.918
So when did the kiss happen?

16:02.962 --> 16:04.398
Uh, about a week later.

16:04.441 --> 16:06.835
Yeah, we, uh, ran into each
other at the health center.

16:06.878 --> 16:09.577
I was getting a checkup on my
nose, and she was getting, uh...

16:09.620 --> 16:11.622
getting one for her
little brain sprain.

16:11.666 --> 16:14.016
Yeah, and, uh, we ended up
walking to the pharmacy together

16:14.060 --> 16:16.801
to pick up our meds,
and then to a restaurant,

16:16.845 --> 16:19.021
'cause we couldn't take our
meds on an empty stomach.

16:19.065 --> 16:20.675
Right.
COOPER: Okay.

16:20.718 --> 16:23.025
Okay, so you dated someone else,

16:23.069 --> 16:25.027
and you played it cool
for a month.

16:25.071 --> 16:27.638
Then you severely injured
each other,

16:27.682 --> 16:30.598
and went on a pity date
that was just errands?

16:31.816 --> 16:34.776
The rest is kisstory.

16:34.819 --> 16:37.431
Um, I'm gonna ask
that barista out another time.

16:37.474 --> 16:40.086
I thought your love story
would inspire me, but instead,

16:40.129 --> 16:44.003
it's just made me painfully
aware of the randomness of life.

16:45.613 --> 16:46.962
I guess you're right.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.485
[sighs]

16:48.529 --> 16:52.011
From now on, Claire, I'll just
say we, uh, met in college.

16:54.535 --> 16:57.059
Well, Jake, wait.
[chuckles] Uh...

16:57.103 --> 17:00.802
We still haven't told Cooper
how the kiss happened.

17:00.845 --> 17:03.761
Huh, right?Oh, yeah. Uh...

17:03.805 --> 17:06.764
Her mouth was closed.
I went in with tongue.

17:08.897 --> 17:11.204
I basically just
licked her lips.

17:12.727 --> 17:15.817
Okay, okay, I guess I'm the one
that's gonna have to tell you,

17:15.860 --> 17:17.819
'cause Jake
is obviously embarrassed

17:17.862 --> 17:20.865
by how romantic it was.

a new transfer application.

to leave tomorrow.

shut up about New Hampshire,
