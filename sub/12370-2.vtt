WEBVTT

00:01.751 --> 00:03.253
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i> IS RECORDED

00:03.336 --> 00:05.505
IN FRONT OF
A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:05.588 --> 00:07.424
- SPECIAL AGENT
GRIFFIN GILMORE,

00:07.507 --> 00:10.051
ADMINISTERING
POLYGRAPH EXAMINATION.

00:10.135 --> 00:11.761
CASE NUMBER 2498,
ESCAPE FROM

00:11.845 --> 00:13.722
OHIO FEDERAL
CORRECTIONS FACILITY,

00:13.805 --> 00:15.557
PRISONER: EMMET LAWSON.

00:15.640 --> 00:17.183
- SIR.
- YES?

00:17.267 --> 00:19.436
- EMMET IS A SIR.

00:19.519 --> 00:21.146
HE WAS KNIGHTED
BY THE QUEEN,

00:21.229 --> 00:24.733
YOU KNOW, LIKE SIR ELTON JOHN
AND SIR PAUL MCCARTNEY.

00:24.816 --> 00:26.735
I MEAN, MAYBE THE QUEEN
IS JUST A BIG FAME WHORE

00:26.818 --> 00:28.570
AND THIS IS HER WAY
OF MEETING CELEBRITIES,

00:28.653 --> 00:30.238
BUT IT SHOULD
COUNT FOR SOMETHING.

00:30.321 --> 00:32.907
- IT DOESN'T.

00:32.991 --> 00:34.659
OKAY, I'M GONNA ASK YOU
A FEW SIMPLE QUESTIONS,

00:34.743 --> 00:36.745
JUST TO ESTABLISH
A BASELINE RESPONSE.

00:36.828 --> 00:38.788
STATE YOUR NAME.
- VICTORIA CHASE.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.833
- AGE?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:41.916 --> 00:43.126
- HOW OLD YOU ARE.

00:43.209 --> 00:45.754
- PASS.
NEXT QUESTION.

00:45.837 --> 00:46.588
- ADDRESS?

00:46.671 --> 00:50.967
- UH, 60-SOMETHING
CEDARCLIFF ROAD,

00:51.050 --> 00:52.969
CLEVELAND--OHIO.

00:53.052 --> 00:55.597
I-I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE

00:55.680 --> 00:57.974
THAT I ACTUALLY
LIVE IN CLEVELAND.

00:58.057 --> 00:59.476
BUT IN L.A.,
WE WERE FEELING

00:59.559 --> 01:01.811
DEVALUED AND DISPOSABLE.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.855
- MS. CHASE, THIS
IS A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION,

01:03.938 --> 01:05.982
NOT A CELEBRITY INTERVIEW.

01:06.065 --> 01:07.025
- NO, YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS?

01:07.108 --> 01:08.485
THIS--THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

01:08.568 --> 01:11.029
NOW I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT WHERE EMMET IS,

01:11.112 --> 01:12.197
OR IF HE'S OKAY,

01:12.280 --> 01:13.782
OR IF I'M EVER
GOING TO SEE HIM AGAIN.

01:13.865 --> 01:15.784
ALL I KNOW IS THAT
HE LEFT PRISON

01:15.867 --> 01:18.453
WEARING MY CLOTHES,
MY WIG, AND MY SHOES.

01:18.536 --> 01:21.164
- HER SHOES?
THOSE ARE MY SHOES.

01:21.247 --> 01:22.791
WORKED WITH JEANS
AND DRESSES--

01:22.874 --> 01:25.210
A FIVE-INCH HEEL
YOU COULD ACTUALLY WALK IN.

01:25.293 --> 01:28.463
[sighs]
I MISS THEM.

01:28.546 --> 01:31.466
I'M SORRY,
I'M A LITTLE HORMONAL.

01:31.549 --> 01:33.843
IS THAT THING AFFECTED
BY SOMEONE BEING PREGNANT?

01:33.927 --> 01:36.805
- NO, BUT I DON'T SEE
WHY THAT WOULD BE AN ISSUE.

01:38.306 --> 01:39.557
- WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

01:39.641 --> 01:41.559
THAT I'M TOO OLD
TO GET PREGNANT?

01:41.643 --> 01:44.687
- AND THAT'S REGISTERING
AS A TRUTHFUL STATEMENT.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.523
- [laughs]
WELL, THE JOKE'S ON YOU,

01:46.606 --> 01:48.483
LIE DETECTOR,
BECAUSE I AM PREGNANT.

01:48.566 --> 01:50.985
- OH, CONGRATULATIONS
TO YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND.

01:51.069 --> 01:53.154
- THANK YOU.
WE'RE VERY HAPPY.

01:53.238 --> 01:56.032
- AND THAT'S REGISTERING
AS A FALSE STATEMENT.

01:56.115 --> 01:58.326
- OKAY, UM,
I'M NOT MARRIED.

01:58.409 --> 02:00.870
BUT MY BOYFRIEND IS THRILLED.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.330
THAT'S ALSO
REGISTERING FALSE--

02:02.413 --> 02:03.998
- FINE, HE'S NOT
MY BOYFRIEND ANYMORE

02:04.082 --> 02:05.375
AND I HAVEN'T TOLD HIM.

02:05.458 --> 02:06.501
WE BROKE UP MONTHS AGO

02:06.584 --> 02:08.336
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.170
BUT I REALLY SHOULD TELL HIM,
SHOULDN'T I?

02:10.255 --> 02:11.548
WHAT DOES THAT MACHINE SAY?

02:11.631 --> 02:15.510
- IT'S A POLYGRAPH, MA'AM,
NOT A MAGIC EIGHT BALL.

02:15.593 --> 02:16.845
- THERE'S NO REASON
TO BE MEAN.

02:16.928 --> 02:18.012
- SORRY, MA'AM.

02:18.096 --> 02:21.224
- I WAS TALKING
ABOUT THE "MA'AM."

02:21.307 --> 02:23.560
- IT'S JUST
THE WEIRDEST THING.

02:23.643 --> 02:24.936
THE LAST FEW DAYS,
MEN HAVE BEEN

02:25.019 --> 02:27.605
COMING OUT OF THE WOODWORK
AND HITTING ON ME,

02:27.689 --> 02:30.400
GIVING ME THE OLD,
"HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?"

02:30.483 --> 02:32.527
ON ONE HAND,
IT'S FLATTERING.

02:32.610 --> 02:34.863
ON THE OTHER,
IT'S TERRIBLE TIMING.

02:34.946 --> 02:36.197
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

02:36.281 --> 02:39.284
- I ASKED IF YOU
WERE READY TO BEGIN.

02:39.367 --> 02:41.578
- I AM.

02:41.661 --> 02:42.620
- MS. SCROGGS,
DO YOU RECALL

02:42.704 --> 02:44.873
ANYTHING STRANGE ABOUT
EMMET LAWSON'S BEHAVIOR

02:44.956 --> 02:46.749
THE LAST TIME
THAT YOU SAW HIM?

02:46.833 --> 02:49.252
- NO. BUT I WAS
TOO DISTRACTED BY THE FACT

02:49.335 --> 02:52.088
THAT THE PRIEST,
AN UNDERCOVER TABLOID REPORTER,

02:52.171 --> 02:53.798
TURNED OUT TO BE
THE BABY-DADDY

02:53.882 --> 02:55.758
I HAVEN'T SEEN IN 33 YEARS.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.093
AND HE'S COMING BACK FOR ME,

02:57.176 --> 02:59.053
AS SOON AS HE INFILTRATES
KENSINGTON PALACE

02:59.137 --> 03:02.599
AND GETS PICTURES
OF THE ROYAL BABY.

03:05.184 --> 03:08.438
- ALL THREE OF 'EM
ARE CRAZY.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.732
- THAT'S REGISTERING AS TRUE.

03:10.815 --> 03:12.483
- YOU DIDN'T LOOK
AT THE MACHINE.

03:12.567 --> 03:15.653
- I DIDN'T HAVE TO.

03:15.737 --> 03:18.781
- THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO CONFESS.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.241
- YES?

03:20.325 --> 03:22.952
- IT HAPPENED
50 YEARS AGO,

03:23.036 --> 03:26.414
DURING A DRUNKEN WEEKEND
IN ATLANTIC CITY.

03:26.497 --> 03:28.499
- GO ON.

03:28.583 --> 03:34.088
- I SLEPT WITH FRANK SINATRA.

03:34.172 --> 03:35.465
- AND WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME THIS?

03:35.548 --> 03:37.634
- WHAT DOES THE MACHINE SAY?

03:37.717 --> 03:39.135
- "TRUTHFUL STATEMENT."

03:39.218 --> 03:41.095
- FINALLY, I HAVE PROOF!

03:41.179 --> 03:44.182
PRINT THAT OUT.

03:44.265 --> 03:45.600
- NO, NO,
I CANNOT RELEASE THIS.

03:45.683 --> 03:46.935
- YES, YOU CAN.

03:47.018 --> 03:50.897
I'VE GOT A FACEBOOK STATUS
TO UPDATE.

03:55.234 --> 03:57.612
- ♪ BA-BA, BA-BA ♪

03:57.695 --> 04:00.323
♪ BA-BA, BA-BA ♪

04:00.406 --> 04:01.491

{\an8}ANYTHING LIKE THAT
IN MY CAREER.

04:04.243 --> 04:06.162
{\an8}YOU ARE EITHER
AN EXTREMELY SKILLED LIAR

04:06.245 --> 04:07.830
{\an8}OR AN EXTREMELY HONEST
28-YEAR-OLD.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.625
{\an8}- THANK YOU.

04:10.708 --> 04:12.502
{\an8}- YOU GOT ONE TRUTH
OUT OF US--

04:12.585 --> 04:16.380
{\an8}SINATRA.

04:16.464 --> 04:20.093
{\an8}HE DID ME HIS WAY.

04:24.222 --> 04:25.640
{\an8}- MS. CHASE, YOU ARE STILL
A PERSON OF INTEREST

04:25.723 --> 04:26.808

{\an8}- HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?

04:47.620 --> 04:50.164
{\an8}- OH, I MUST
REALLY MISS EMMET.

04:50.248 --> 04:51.666
{\an8}EVEN MY HOUSE
SURROUNDED BY PAPARAZZI

04:51.749 --> 04:53.376
{\an8}ISN'T CHEERING ME UP.

04:53.459 --> 04:56.212
{\an8}I-I JUST WISH
I KNEW HE WAS OKAY.

04:56.295 --> 04:57.505
{\an8}- WELL, HONEY,
JUST DON'T THINK THE WORST.

04:57.588 --> 04:58.673
{\an8}- WELL, IF I DON'T
HEAR FROM HIM SOON,

04:58.756 --> 05:00.425
{\an8}I AM GONNA LOSE MY MIND.

05:00.508 --> 05:02.010
{\an8}- MAYBE WE SHOULD
BE LOOKING FOR CLUES

05:02.093 --> 05:03.886
{\an8}THE FBI ISN'T LOOKING FOR.

05:03.970 --> 05:04.929
{\an8}- LIKE WHAT?

05:05.013 --> 05:08.433
- EMMET LEFT IN VICTORIA'S
WEDDING CLOTHES, RIGHT?

05:08.516 --> 05:10.184
THOSE SHOES ARE VALUABLE.

05:10.268 --> 05:12.562
AND SINCE THOSE SHOES
ARE VALUABLE,

05:12.645 --> 05:14.397
SOMEONE'S EITHER
WEARING THEM

05:14.480 --> 05:18.401
OR TRYING TO MAKE MONEY
OFF THEM ON EBAY.

05:18.484 --> 05:19.402
AH-HA!

05:19.485 --> 05:21.404
- [gasps]
MY SHOES!

05:21.487 --> 05:23.573
- IT'S POSTED BY
A SELLER IN NEWARK.

05:23.656 --> 05:28.703
- AHH, SO HE MADE IT
OUT OF THE COUNTRY.

05:28.786 --> 05:31.789
OH, RUN, EMMET, RUN.

05:33.666 --> 05:37.420
- NEWARK IS IN NEW JERSEY.

05:37.503 --> 05:39.005
- I'M CONTACTING THE SELLER
TO SEE IF SHE

05:39.088 --> 05:40.715
HAS ANY INFORMATION
ON EMMET.

05:40.798 --> 05:42.258
WE HAVE OUR FIRST LEAD.

05:42.341 --> 05:43.384
- OH, THANK GOD.

05:43.468 --> 05:44.385
YOU KNOW,
ON <i> EDGE OF TOMORROW,</i>

05:44.469 --> 05:46.763
HONOR ST. RAVEN
ONCE CLONED A MISSING LOVER

05:46.846 --> 05:50.224
FROM THE DNA
LEFT IN HIS SHOE.

05:50.308 --> 05:54.479
- LET'S CALL THAT
"PLAN 'B'."

05:55.813 --> 05:56.814
- YEAH, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF MY SHOES

05:56.898 --> 05:57.815
WILL FIT ME ANYMORE.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.735
MY FEET SWELL UP
TWO SIZES WHEN I'M PREGNANT.

06:00.818 --> 06:02.153
[sighs]
PREGNANT.

06:02.236 --> 06:05.114
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

06:05.198 --> 06:08.618
- WELL, MELANIE,
WHEN A MAN AND A WOMAN

06:08.701 --> 06:13.039
LOVE EACH OTHER VERY MUCH,

06:13.122 --> 06:15.792
AND THE WOMAN
IS PUSHING 50--

06:15.875 --> 06:20.213
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

06:21.881 --> 06:22.882
- IT JUST DID.

06:22.965 --> 06:24.300
AND I HAVE TO TELL ALEC.

06:24.383 --> 06:25.802
- ARE YOU HOPING
THAT THE TWO OF YOU--

06:25.885 --> 06:28.054
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M HOPING.

06:28.137 --> 06:29.597
THIS CONVERSATION
IS NOT GONNA BE EASY.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.474
I BROKE HIS HEART.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.976
I HOPE WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT
CALMLY, AS ADULTS,

06:34.060 --> 06:36.646
WITH THE LEAST AMOUNT OF DRAMA
AND AWKWARDNESS POSSIBLE.

06:36.729 --> 06:38.147
I THINK I CAN DO THAT.

06:38.231 --> 06:42.110
- WITHOUT ALCOHOL?
- OH, GOD.

06:42.193 --> 06:45.446
VICTORIA, TELL ME
WHAT CRAZY THING YOU DID

06:45.530 --> 06:47.907
ON <i> EDGE OF TOMORROW</i>
WHEN THIS SITUATION CAME UP.

06:47.990 --> 06:51.285
- WHAT, SOMEONE YOUR AGE
GETTING PREGNANT?

06:51.369 --> 06:54.539
WELL, EVEN <i> EDGE OF TOMORROW</i>
WOULDN'T TOUCH THAT.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.630
- HEY, ALEC.

07:02.713 --> 07:05.216
MM. HI, ALEC.

07:05.299 --> 07:06.717
AAH.

07:06.801 --> 07:09.637
[deep voice]
ALEC.

07:09.720 --> 07:10.847
- MELANIE.
- AAH! OH.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.557
ALEC, ALEC,

07:12.640 --> 07:14.517
I DIDN'T EXPECT
TO SEE YOU HERE.

07:14.600 --> 07:18.354
- BUT YOU'RE STANDING
RIGHT OUTSIDE MY APARTMENT.

07:18.437 --> 07:21.649
- YES. YES, I AM.

07:21.732 --> 07:23.317
I KNOW IT'S WEIRD,

07:23.401 --> 07:24.819
ME COMING HERE
OUT OF THE BLUE.

07:24.902 --> 07:26.154
BUT IT'S JUST THAT
I HAVE SOMETHING

07:26.237 --> 07:28.156
I NEED TO TELL YOU.

07:28.239 --> 07:29.157
IT'S NOTHING, REALLY.
- OH.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.658
- I MEAN, IT'S NOT NOTHING,
IT'S SOMETHING.

07:30.741 --> 07:31.701
IT'S A WHOLE LOT
OF SOMETHING.

07:31.784 --> 07:33.161
UNLESS YOU WANT IT
TO BE NOTHING.

07:33.244 --> 07:36.205
IN THAT CASE,
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.833
- I DON'T EVEN
PARTLY UNDERSTAND.

07:38.916 --> 07:42.545
WHY DON'T WE GO INSIDE
AND TALK ABOUT IT?

07:42.628 --> 07:44.881
- ALEC, I'M PREGNANT
AND IT'S YOURS.

07:44.964 --> 07:48.426
all: SURPRISE!

07:54.932 --> 07:55.933
- HI, EVERYBODY.

07:56.017 --> 07:57.351
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT THIS.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.729
I CAN'T IMAGINE
ANYTHING MORE AWKWARD.

07:59.812 --> 08:02.064
- I CAN. HI.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.734
I'M KELLY,
ALEC'S NEW GIRLFRIEND.

08:04.817 --> 08:06.360
- HI.
[chuckles]

08:06.444 --> 08:10.531
I'M MELANIE, ALEC'S OLD--
EX-GIRLFRIEND.

08:10.615 --> 08:11.532
- I KNOW.

08:11.616 --> 08:14.410
I SAW YOUR FACE ON THE PHOTO MUG
YOU GAVE HIM.

08:14.493 --> 08:16.078
- YOU KEPT THAT?

08:16.162 --> 08:19.290
- IT BROKE.

08:19.373 --> 08:20.791
NOW I KNOW WHY
YOU'RE HERE.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.419
YOU'RE PREGNANT
WITH MY BOYFRIEND'S BABY.

08:23.502 --> 08:26.297
UH, BUT WHO
ARE THESE WOMEN?

08:28.716 --> 08:29.926
- GUYS.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.052
- I-I GOT THIS.

08:31.135 --> 08:32.303
WE'RE MELANIE'S
DEAREST FRIENDS,

08:32.385 --> 08:34.179
WHO HAVE BEEN EAVESDROPPING
IN THE HALLWAY,

08:34.263 --> 08:36.807
JUST IN CASE SHE HIDEOUSLY
EMBARRASSED HERSELF.

08:36.890 --> 08:39.519
WHICH SHE DID.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.437
- HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?

08:41.520 --> 08:44.482
- [whispers]
AGAIN!

08:45.441 --> 08:47.485
- MELANIE, MAYBE WE SHOULD
TALK IN PRIVATE.

08:47.568 --> 08:49.487
- I'M NOT LEAVING.
I LIVE HERE.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.280
- YOU LIVE HERE?

08:51.364 --> 08:54.992
WOW, THAT WAS FAST.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.119
- IF SHE'S STAYING,
WE'RE STAYING.

08:57.203 --> 09:00.206
- AND IF WE'RE STAYING,
I'M POURING.

09:03.334 --> 09:04.585
- MELANIE, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO THINK

09:04.669 --> 09:05.962
I'M NOT HAPPY
ABOUT THIS NEWS.

09:06.045 --> 09:08.673
WE TALKED ABOUT
HAVING CHILDREN.

09:08.756 --> 09:10.925
WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT
HAVING CHILDREN, BUT--

09:11.008 --> 09:12.593
THAT WE WOULD PLAN.

09:12.677 --> 09:16.597
NOT THAT UNPLANNED CHILDREN
AREN'T EXCITING--

09:16.681 --> 09:19.809
EXCITING IN A CONFUSING WAY.

09:19.892 --> 09:22.353
IS IT INCREDIBLY HOT IN HERE?

09:22.436 --> 09:23.479
- MAYBE I SHOULD GO.

09:23.562 --> 09:25.773
- NO, NO, WAIT.

09:25.856 --> 09:27.942
I WANNA BE THERE EVERY STEP
OF THE WAY FOR THIS BABY.

09:28.025 --> 09:31.320
-<i> WE'LL</i> BE THERE
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.488
- HAVE YOU BEEN
TO THE DOCTOR YET?

09:32.572 --> 09:33.990
- MY FIRST APPOINTMENT'S
TOMORROW.

09:34.073 --> 09:37.827
- I'LL BE THERE.
-<i> WE'LL</i> BE THERE.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.370
LOOK, I'M NOT NORMALLY
SO BITCHY.

09:39.453 --> 09:41.497
IN FACT, I BET IF WE MET
UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES,

09:41.580 --> 09:42.665
WE'D BE FRIENDS.

09:42.748 --> 09:45.042
AND I'D BE WONDERING
WHERE YOU GOT THAT GREAT DRESS.

09:45.126 --> 09:47.044
- OH, THANKS.
YEAH, I GOT IT AT--

09:47.128 --> 09:50.298
- BUT UNDER
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES,

09:50.381 --> 09:53.175
ALL I'M WONDERING IS,
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE

09:53.259 --> 09:55.886
THAT ALEC'S THE FATHER
OF THAT BABY?

09:55.970 --> 09:58.389
[all gasp]

09:58.472 --> 10:01.517
- OH, A DRINK AND A SHOW.

10:09.817 --> 10:11.402
- YOU KNOW, IN FRANCE,

10:11.485 --> 10:13.195
PREGNANT WOMEN
ARE ALLOWED TO DRINK WINE.

10:13.279 --> 10:17.199
- YES, BUT THEN THEY GIVE BIRTH
TO FRENCH PEOPLE.

10:20.077 --> 10:22.705
- THIS IS FROM
THAT GENTLEMAN OVER THERE.

10:22.788 --> 10:26.000
- HEY. HOW'S IT GOING?

10:26.083 --> 10:27.918
- WHAT IS GOING ON?
[giggles]

10:28.002 --> 10:30.921
WHY AM I SUDDENLY
SO DESIRABLE?

10:31.005 --> 10:33.049
- IT'S SIMON.
- SIMON?

10:33.132 --> 10:34.342
HOW DO YOU FIGURE?

10:34.425 --> 10:37.345
- WELL, NOW THAT
YOU'RE NOT LOOKING FOR A MAN,

10:37.428 --> 10:42.058
YOU DON'T REEK
OF DESPERATION.

10:42.141 --> 10:45.353
- REEK OF DESPERATION?
THAT'S INSANE.

10:45.436 --> 10:48.439
THERE'S NO SMELL.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.609
- YOU KNOW
WHO SMELLED GREAT?

10:51.692 --> 10:55.696
SINATRA.

10:55.780 --> 10:58.616
- I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU SLEPT WITH HIM.

10:58.699 --> 11:02.870
- WE STARTED OFF
STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT.

11:02.953 --> 11:05.623
BUT BY THE WEE SMALL HOURS,

11:05.706 --> 11:09.585
THIS LADY WAS A TRAMP.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.173
- CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

11:14.256 --> 11:16.050
WHY DID YOU
SEND THAT DRINK?

11:16.133 --> 11:17.593
- WELL, YOU'RE
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

11:17.676 --> 11:18.928
I MEAN,
I DIDN'T SEE A RING.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.721
I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD
HAVE DINNER SOMETIME.

11:20.805 --> 11:23.557
- OH, NORMALLY I WOULD
LOVE THAT, BUT I CAN'T,

11:23.641 --> 11:24.392
AS I'VE JUST REKINDLED

11:24.475 --> 11:26.894
A RELATIONSHIP
WITH MY BABY-DADDY.

11:26.977 --> 11:30.898
- OH, UH,
HOW OLD'S YOUR BABY?

11:30.981 --> 11:33.859
- 400 MONTHS.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.780
- WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO GET IN THE MIDDLE

11:37.863 --> 11:39.240
OF A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP.

11:39.323 --> 11:40.533
- THANKS.

11:40.616 --> 11:43.411
THOUGH IT'S HARD TO SAY
HOW SERIOUS IT IS.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.121
HE'S OUT OF THE COUNTRY
AND HE SAID HE'D COME BACK.

11:45.204 --> 11:45.996
BUT WHAT IF HE DOESN'T?

11:46.080 --> 11:48.999
YOU KNOW HOW MEN ARE,
AT LEAST WITH ME.

11:49.083 --> 11:52.420
SO I GUESS THE SMART THING
WOULD BE TO HEDGE MY BET.

11:52.503 --> 11:54.713
SO IT CAN'T HURT
IF I GIVE YOU

11:54.797 --> 11:57.633
MY PHONE NUMBER AND EMAIL.

11:57.716 --> 11:59.510
I'M ALSO ON INSTAGRAM
AND FACEBOOK,

11:59.593 --> 12:03.013
JUST SEARCH
FOR SCROGGDOGG39,

12:03.097 --> 12:05.015
WHICH IS ALSO
MY TWITTER HANDLE.

12:05.099 --> 12:06.100
HERE YOU GO.

12:06.183 --> 12:07.143
AND YOU CAN JUST
TELL ME YOUR NAME

12:07.226 --> 12:10.855
WHEN YOU CALL ME.

12:10.938 --> 12:12.273
- SO?

12:12.356 --> 12:14.775
- NOT ONE WORD
ABOUT DESPERATION.

12:14.859 --> 12:16.152
- OH, I'M SORRY.

12:16.235 --> 12:19.488
THE GENTLEMAN WOULD
LIKE HIS DRINK BACK.

12:21.782 --> 12:24.827
[phone beeps]

12:24.910 --> 12:26.829
- OH, I GOT A MESSAGE
FROM THE LADY ON EBAY.

12:26.912 --> 12:27.830
- WHAT DOES IT SAY?

12:27.913 --> 12:30.040
- "YOUR SHOES WERE FOUND
IN THE DRESSING ROOM

12:30.124 --> 12:32.126
OF THE NEWARK
COMMUNITY PLAYHOUSE."

12:32.209 --> 12:34.545
- COMMUNITY THEATER
IN NEW JERSEY?

12:34.628 --> 12:38.799
HE WAS BETTER OFF
IN PRISON.

12:38.883 --> 12:41.844
I-I'M DRIVING MYSELF CRAZY
WAITING TO HEAR FROM HIM.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.846
AND THE WORST PART IS,
I KNOW THAT

12:43.929 --> 12:47.892
FBI AGENT IS SITTING
ON ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION.

12:50.394 --> 12:51.687
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:51.770 --> 12:53.189
- I'M A WOMAN, MELANIE.

12:53.272 --> 12:56.358
I THINK I CAN GET INFORMATION
FROM A MAN.

13:01.906 --> 13:05.075
- MS. CHASE.
- AGENT GILMORE.

13:05.159 --> 13:08.370
MAY I TELL YOU SOMETHING
IN STRICTEST CONFIDENCE?

13:08.454 --> 13:10.498
- I'VE BEEN HOPING
THAT YOU WOULD.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.544
- I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU
WATCH ME,

13:15.628 --> 13:17.922
AND I THINK YOU'RE WASTING YOUR
TALENTS WITH THE GOVERNMENT.

13:18.005 --> 13:20.382
OH, YOU'RE A GOOD-LOOKING GUY.

13:20.466 --> 13:25.095
YOU SHOULD BE PLAYING
AN FBI AGENT ON TV.

13:25.179 --> 13:27.014
AND NOT JUST NETWORK TV.

13:27.097 --> 13:32.228
PREMIUM CABLE....
WITH NUDITY.

13:32.311 --> 13:35.064
I'D WATCH THAT.

13:35.147 --> 13:36.774
- SERIOUSLY?
WOW.

13:36.857 --> 13:40.236
THAT IS SOMETHING
COMING FROM VICTORIA CHASE.

13:40.319 --> 13:41.946
MAY I SAY SOMETHING TO YOU ALSO
IN CONFIDENCE?

13:42.029 --> 13:44.073
- OH, PLEASE,
TELL ME ANYTHING.

13:44.156 --> 13:46.700
- WHEN I LOOK INTO YOUR EYES,
IT'S LIKE I'M SEEING TWO PEOPLE.

13:46.784 --> 13:48.285
THERE'S THE VICTORIA CHASE
THAT EVERYONE KNOWS--

13:48.369 --> 13:51.080
BEAUTIFUL, BRILLIANT,
CONFIDENT--

13:51.163 --> 13:54.959
BUT BEHIND THAT THERE'S A WOMAN
WHO'S FRAGILE, SOFT...

13:55.042 --> 13:56.043
SOMETIMES EVEN SAD.

13:56.126 --> 13:58.170
- OH, MY GOD.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.881
THAT IS SO TRUE.
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

14:00.965 --> 14:02.925
- BECAUSE THEY TEACH US
TO USE THAT LINE ON WOMEN

14:03.008 --> 14:06.178
IN, LIKE, THE FIRST DAY
OF INTERROGATION CLASS.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.599
DO NOT TRY TO PLAY ME,
MS. CHASE.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.476
I CANNOT COMMENT
ON THE INVESTIGATION.

14:12.560 --> 14:13.978
- I'M SORRY.
I JUST--

14:14.061 --> 14:16.438
I LOVE EMMET SO MUCH AND
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF HE'S ALIVE.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.982
CAN'T YOU JUST
GIVE ME SOMETHING?

14:18.065 --> 14:21.652
- I CAN'T COMMENT
ON THE CASE.

14:21.735 --> 14:23.862
- I UNDERSTAND.

14:26.657 --> 14:29.118
- BUT I CAN ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

14:29.201 --> 14:31.161
DO YOU REALLY THINK
WE'D BE TRAILING YOU

14:31.245 --> 14:33.163
IF WE WEREN'T FAIRLY CERTAIN

14:33.247 --> 14:37.418
THAT YOUR HUSBAND
WERE GOING TO CONTACT YOU?

14:37.501 --> 14:39.962
- THANK YOU FOR THAT.

14:40.045 --> 14:43.507
AND, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE REALLY NOT
AS TOUGH AS YOU SEEM.

14:43.591 --> 14:47.553
- I COULD KILL A MAN
WITH MY THUMB.

14:47.636 --> 14:49.054
I CAN ALSO KILL A MAN
WITH MY ELBOW,

14:49.138 --> 14:51.932
SO I GUESS I'M TWO PEOPLE TOO.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.988
- OH!
FULL HOUSE.

15:06.071 --> 15:07.489
- HI, DR. WILCOX.

15:07.573 --> 15:10.159
THIS IS ALEC,
THE BABY'S FATHER,

15:10.242 --> 15:12.453
AND KELLY,
THE BABY'S FATHER'S GIRLFRIEND,

15:12.536 --> 15:14.997
AND MY GIRLFRIENDS VICTORIA
AND JOY.

15:15.080 --> 15:18.375
- HEY.
HOW'S IT GOING?

15:18.459 --> 15:21.170
- IT'S BACK.

15:21.253 --> 15:24.173
- MELANIE, I WAS HOPING WE MIGHT
BE ABLE TO TALK PRIVATELY.

15:24.256 --> 15:25.299
- OH, NO, THAT'S OKAY.

15:25.382 --> 15:27.134
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN'T SAY
IN FRONT OF THESE PEOPLE

15:27.217 --> 15:30.054
THAT CARE ABOUT ME...
AND KELLY.

15:31.805 --> 15:33.015
- OKAY.

15:33.098 --> 15:34.975
I FOUND SOME ABNORMALITIES
IN YOUR BLOOD WORK

15:35.059 --> 15:37.519
THAT WERE INDICATIVE
OF A FALSE PREGNANCY.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.188
SO WE RE-RAN IT AND CONFIRMED

15:39.271 --> 15:41.690
THAT YOU ARE DEFINITELY
NOT PREGNANT.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.692
- I--I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.694
I TOOK, LIKE,
THREE HOME PREGNANCY TESTS.

15:45.778 --> 15:46.695
THEY WERE ALL POSITIVE.

15:46.779 --> 15:47.738
- IT'S TRUE.

15:47.821 --> 15:49.865
OUR WASTEBIN LOOKED LIKE
A SORORITY HOUSE DUMPSTER

15:49.948 --> 15:53.243
A MONTH AFTER SPRING BREAK.

15:53.327 --> 15:55.704
- SO WHAT COULD BE CAUSING
THE FALSE PREGNANCY?

15:55.788 --> 15:57.164
- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS
IT COULD BE,

15:57.247 --> 15:58.874
SOME OF THEM
POTENTIALLY SERIOUS.

15:58.957 --> 16:01.377
SO WE NEED TO DO MORE TESTS.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.879
- OH, WELL, HOW--
HOW SERIOUS?

16:03.962 --> 16:06.215
- UNFORTUNATELY, THIS ISN'T
MY AREA OF EXPERTISE,

16:06.298 --> 16:10.219
BUT I CAN RECOMMEND SOME
VERY CAPABLE DOCTORS.

16:10.302 --> 16:13.347
LET ME GET YOU A LIST.

16:17.351 --> 16:18.727
[door closes]

16:18.811 --> 16:22.564
- I'M SORRY, MELANIE.

16:22.648 --> 16:23.857
WE SHOULD GO.
- YEAH.

16:23.941 --> 16:26.235
UH, JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE.

16:26.318 --> 16:29.321
- UM, WE'LL BE OUTSIDE.

16:34.034 --> 16:35.577
[door closes]

16:35.661 --> 16:37.079
- LOOK, I WANTED TO STAND
BY YOUR SIDE

16:37.162 --> 16:39.248
DURING YOUR PREGNANCY.

16:39.331 --> 16:44.086
AND I'LL STAND BY YOUR SIDE
FOR WHATEVER THIS IS.

16:44.169 --> 16:46.255
- THAT'S SWEET.
THANK YOU.

16:46.338 --> 16:49.258
BUT I HAVE A REALLY GOOD
SUPPORT TEAM.

16:49.341 --> 16:50.300
- YES, YOU DO.

16:50.384 --> 16:51.885
Victoria: YEAH, SHE DOES.

16:56.974 --> 17:01.103
- OKAY, I AM READY
TO TELL YOU NOW.

17:01.186 --> 17:03.272
I HAVE A TUMOR
IN MY PITUITARY GLAND,

17:03.355 --> 17:05.107
BUT THEY CAUGHT IT EARLY,
SO IT'S TREATABLE.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.983
- WHAT?
- OH, MY GOD, MELANIE.

17:07.067 --> 17:08.193
A BRAIN TUMOR?

17:08.277 --> 17:09.653
- YEAH, BUT IT'S HIGHLY CURABLE.

17:09.737 --> 17:12.114
IT'S, LIKE, LITERALLY
THE BEST TUMOR YOU CAN GET.

17:12.196 --> 17:14.867
- AND YOU DESERVE THE BEST,
MELANIE.

17:17.661 --> 17:20.164
- I WILL HAVE TO HAVE RADIATION
AND MAYBE SURGERY,

17:20.247 --> 17:22.750
BUT THEY JUST GO IN UP THROUGH
YOUR NOSE AND SNIP IT OUT.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.084
- WOW!
AND WHEN THEY'RE UP THERE,

17:24.167 --> 17:28.005
THEY CAN FIX THAT LITTLE BUMP.

17:28.088 --> 17:30.215
- WHAT BUMP?
- VICTORIA!

17:30.299 --> 17:33.635
- OH, YES,
AND WE'LL DO THE LIPS TOO.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.431
- OKAY.
I'M NOT PREGNANT,

17:37.514 --> 17:39.183
SO MY FEET WON'T SWELL UP,

17:39.266 --> 17:40.809
SO I CAN WEAR
MY JIMMY CHOOS AGAIN!

17:40.893 --> 17:42.853
- OHH.
- I GOT 'EM BACK FROM EBAY.

17:42.936 --> 17:44.146
- THAT WAS YOU?

17:44.229 --> 17:47.649
YOU'RE THOSEAREMYSHOESBITCH99?
[doorbell rings]

17:53.614 --> 17:55.574
- AGENT GILMORE.

17:55.657 --> 17:56.450
- JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW

17:56.533 --> 17:58.327
THAT ANOTHER AGENT
WILL BE HERE SOON.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.788
I'VE BEEN TAKEN OFF THE CASE.
- WHY?

18:00.871 --> 18:02.831
- WELL, THEY SAID
MY REPORTS INDICATE

18:02.915 --> 18:05.709
THAT I HAVE GOTTEN
TOO EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED,

18:05.793 --> 18:07.169
BUT I'VE JUST BEEN WRITING
THE FACTS

18:07.252 --> 18:08.837
THE WAY THAT I SEE THEM.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.673
KELLY IS OBVIOUSLY A REBOUND.

18:11.757 --> 18:14.885
SIMON WOULD BE A FOOL
NOT TO COME BACK FOR JOY.

18:14.968 --> 18:18.639
AND HOW ELSE WOULD I DESCRIBE
YOUR EYES OTHER THAN BEAUTIFUL?

18:18.722 --> 18:21.892
NOW WITH MELANIE'S TUMOR--

18:23.894 --> 18:26.146
I SHOULD BE GOING.

18:26.230 --> 18:29.399
VICTORIA, PERHAPS IF WE'D MET

18:29.483 --> 18:32.027
UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES--

18:32.110 --> 18:34.530
NEVER MIND.
IT'S IN THE REPORT.

18:34.613 --> 18:37.032
- GOOD LUCK, AGENT GILMORE.

18:37.115 --> 18:39.159
OW.
- SORRY.

18:39.243 --> 18:40.953
IT'S MY KILLING THUMB.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.085
- WELL, HE WAS MY LAST CHANCE

18:48.168 --> 18:50.504
OF GETTING ANY INFORMATION
ON EMMET.

18:50.587 --> 18:53.340
[sighs]

18:53.423 --> 18:55.384
YOU KNOW, THE LAST TIME
I SAW THAT SHOE

18:55.467 --> 18:58.262
IT WAS MY WEDDING DAY.

18:58.345 --> 19:02.057
- THERE'S SOMETHING
IN THE TOE.

19:02.140 --> 19:04.768
[gasps]
OH, MY GOD.

19:04.852 --> 19:07.771
IT'S A NOTE FOR YOU.

19:07.855 --> 19:11.233
- OH, MY GOD.
IT'S FROM EMMET.

19:11.316 --> 19:14.862
"MY DARLING VICTORIA,
IF THIS REACHES YOU,

19:14.945 --> 19:18.532
"KNOW THAT I AM SAFE
AND THAT I LOVE YOU.

19:18.615 --> 19:21.243
"I HAVE A PLAN
AND WILL CONTACT YOU SOON.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.704
"WE WILL BE TOGETHER AGAIN.

19:23.787 --> 19:25.414
FROM YOUR DEVOTED HUSBAND."

19:25.497 --> 19:27.457
- OH, SWEETIE.
- THAT'S WONDERFUL.

19:27.541 --> 19:30.085
- HOW DID HE KNOW YOU'D GET
THE SHOE BACK?

19:30.168 --> 19:33.380
- WELL, HE DIDN'T KNOW,
BUT HE HAD HOPE.

19:33.463 --> 19:34.798
AND NOW I HAVE HOPE.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.133
- I HAVE HOPE TOO.

19:36.216 --> 19:38.468
I AM GONNA BEAT
THIS BRAIN TUMOR.

BOTH OF YOUR PROBLEMS

19:40.053 --> 19:42.264

IN PERSPECTIVE FOR ME.

SO DESPERATE.

IF SIMON GETS IN CONTACT,
GOOD.

19:48.186 --> 19:49.771

AND HE CAN'T WAIT TO SEE ME!

19:59.114 --> 20:01.116
WHAT AM I GONNA WEAR?
WHAT IF MY FACE BREAKS OUT?

20:01.199 --> 20:02.826
WHAT IF HE MEETS A MORE
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN THAN ME

20:02.910 --> 20:04.036
ON THE PLANE?
I'LL KILL HER.

20:04.119 --> 20:05.829
THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO.

20:05.913 --> 20:08.498
AND I'LL DO IT SLOWLY.

20:09.917 --> 20:14.087
- YOU KNOW WHO ELSE LIKED
TO DO IT SLOWLY?
