WEBVTT

00:05.338 --> 00:06.715
My name is Bridget.

00:06.756 --> 00:08.299
I witnessed a murder.

00:08.341 --> 00:10.969
Just get up on the stand and
tell the judge what you saw,

00:11.011 --> 00:13.013
and we'll
protect you.
<b></b>
You don't get it.

00:13.054 --> 00:16.182
Bodaway wants me dead,
I'm dead.

00:16.224 --> 00:18.476
BRIDGET: I ran to my sister,
Siobhan, for help.

00:18.518 --> 00:21.021
Siobhan killed herself,
and I assumed her identity.

00:21.062 --> 00:22.022
It was so easy.

00:22.063 --> 00:23.565
I saw a way out,

00:23.606 --> 00:26.359
and I took it.
They all think that I'm her.

00:26.401 --> 00:27.986
You had sex with Mr. Carpenter?

00:28.028 --> 00:29.738
He forced himself on me.

00:29.779 --> 00:32.157
He forced me to have
sex with him, too.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.742
Juliet...

00:33.783 --> 00:35.118
I lied.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.412
Mr. C never actually
assaulted me.

00:37.454 --> 00:39.497
Carpenter's suing you
for defamation of character.

00:39.539 --> 00:40.915
Is this a joke?

00:40.957 --> 00:42.917
He's alleging you've
ruined his career.

00:42.959 --> 00:45.462
So, who wants to toast
to being millionaires?

00:45.503 --> 00:46.838
I do. [laughs]

00:46.880 --> 00:48.757
I do.

00:48.798 --> 00:50.508
SIOBHAN:
I think about Sean every day...

00:50.550 --> 00:52.677
because of what I did.

00:52.719 --> 00:53.845
Bridget, stop.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.263
You're already forgiven.

00:55.305 --> 00:56.347
You just need
to forgive yourself.

00:58.558 --> 01:01.144
MALCOLM: I thought you said
this was your sister's
secret office.

01:01.186 --> 01:04.773
It was. This place
was full of Siobhan's
stuff--there was...

01:04.814 --> 01:06.858
furniture and artwork.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.276
And there was
a huge desk right there.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.113
When was the last time
you were here?

01:12.155 --> 01:14.324
Two days ago.

01:14.365 --> 01:17.035
You said you found a key.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.329
BRIDGET: Yeah, it was
attached to a silver,
boat-shaped key ring,

01:19.370 --> 01:21.164
but that's gone, too, now.

01:22.916 --> 01:26.169
I thought it just
fell out of my purse, but...

01:26.211 --> 01:28.588
What?

01:28.630 --> 01:30.465
Wh-What if someone took it?

01:30.507 --> 01:32.842
I mean, obviously, someone
realized I found this place.

01:32.884 --> 01:35.804
It can't be a coincidence
that the key disappeared, too.

01:35.845 --> 01:38.890
No, probably not.
<b></b>
The guy that helped me

01:38.932 --> 01:41.142
find this place--
Siobhan's driver--

01:41.184 --> 01:42.936
found a woman's shoe print

01:42.977 --> 01:44.896
in the closet.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.690
He thought she was here
at the same time that I was.

01:47.732 --> 01:48.983
If she's the one who
cleaned this place out,

01:49.025 --> 01:50.193
maybe she's the one
who took the key.

01:52.028 --> 01:53.655
I'm still in danger.

01:53.696 --> 01:55.073
And Charlie was
definitely not the person

01:55.115 --> 01:58.535
that wanted Siobhan dead;
it was somebody else.

01:58.576 --> 02:00.620
Let me see your phone.

02:00.662 --> 02:01.996
What? Why?

02:02.038 --> 02:04.457
Tracking app.

02:04.499 --> 02:06.626
I'm putting one
on my phone, too.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.044
It'll use the GPS in
your cell to tell me

02:08.086 --> 02:10.046
where you are
at all times.

02:10.088 --> 02:13.049
You'll be able to do
the same with mine.

02:13.091 --> 02:16.219
We've both been through too much
to take any more chances.

02:16.261 --> 02:18.471
Now we'll always be able
to find each other.

02:18.513 --> 02:19.973
Thank you.

02:20.014 --> 02:21.975
Oh, you're the best.

02:22.016 --> 02:24.894
ANDREW: Diversification is
the key word here, Mr. Ennis.

02:24.936 --> 02:26.646
Yes, the market's
been taking a pounding,

02:26.688 --> 02:29.983
but Martin/Charles is
consistently beating the index.

02:30.024 --> 02:31.860
That's right.
And as the market recovers,

02:31.901 --> 02:33.736
we'll continue
to beat the index,

02:33.778 --> 02:36.948
as we're not utterly
dependent on...

02:36.990 --> 02:38.032
equities.

02:38.074 --> 02:39.117
[clears throat]

02:39.159 --> 02:40.243
Not at all, Mr. Ennis.

02:40.285 --> 02:41.661
Always a pleasure
to talk to you.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.121
Bye-bye.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.832
Sorry. I didn't
mean to interrupt.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.876
If you're looking for Juliet,
she's already left for school.

02:47.917 --> 02:49.002
Well, actually,

02:49.043 --> 02:51.546
I came to see you...
about Juliet.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.216
I'd like her to live
with me in Miami.

03:09.564 --> 03:12.150
I'm sorry, Catherine,
there must be something
wrong with my ears,

03:12.192 --> 03:16.362
but I'd swear that you just
asked me if our daughter could
come and live with you.

03:16.404 --> 03:20.074
Just hear me out, OK?
I didn't come here to fight.

03:20.116 --> 03:21.868
Look, I know that you're
a good father, Andrew,

03:21.910 --> 03:23.203
and despite
our differences,

03:23.244 --> 03:25.288
I know that Siobhan
is a good stepmom.

03:25.330 --> 03:26.831
But that does not
change the fact

03:26.873 --> 03:29.500
that our daughter has been
through a terrible time.

03:29.542 --> 03:30.877
If you're talking
about the assault...

03:30.919 --> 03:33.129
No, it's everything--
it is the drugs,

03:33.171 --> 03:35.298
the fight at the
school, the DUI.

03:35.340 --> 03:38.509
Now, I would like to
call this the icing on
the cake, but it's not.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.011
The case fell apart.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.763
And the monster
who assaulted her

03:41.804 --> 03:43.932
isn't just free, but he's
$10 million richer now

03:43.973 --> 03:46.601
because you had
to settle with him.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.979
Juliet really liked
Miami when she came
to visit in September.

03:50.021 --> 03:53.524
She could enroll
in school there
and make a fresh start.

03:53.566 --> 03:56.152
That's a lovely
idea, Catherine...

03:56.194 --> 04:00.114
but there is a reason
why I was granted full
custody in the first place.

04:00.156 --> 04:02.492
My drinking.
I know.

04:02.533 --> 04:05.536
That is why I'm not
asking for custody in
the traditional sense.

04:05.578 --> 04:07.205
I don't want to get
our attorneys involved.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.332
I want what is
best for Juliet.

04:09.374 --> 04:10.708
I didn't even broach
this with her,

04:10.750 --> 04:13.169
because I wanted your
blessings first.

04:13.211 --> 04:17.465
And as for my drinking, I
haven't had a sip in days.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.592
Now, I know that
that is not much,

04:19.634 --> 04:21.844
but I also know that
to be a proper parent,

04:21.886 --> 04:23.721
I need to make changes,
and the drinking

04:23.763 --> 04:25.181
is just the
beginning.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.308
You've tried to clean up
before, Catherine.

04:27.350 --> 04:30.311
We were married then,
and I was feeling
sorry for myself.

04:30.353 --> 04:32.689
But now, I just want
to help Juliet.

04:35.984 --> 04:37.860
I'm sorry, Catherine.

04:37.902 --> 04:41.030
The custody arrangement
is what it is.

04:41.072 --> 04:42.365
[elevator bell dings,
door opens]

04:48.538 --> 04:51.332
Before I go,
would you do me a favor?

04:51.374 --> 04:52.333
Just really think

04:52.375 --> 04:54.085
about the last 3 months,

04:54.127 --> 04:57.338
and ask yourself if New York is
the best place for our daughter.

04:59.757 --> 05:01.718
[Hip-hop music
playing indistinctly]

05:12.145 --> 05:13.313
[horn honks]

05:16.858 --> 05:17.817
[quietly]
What the...?

05:17.859 --> 05:20.653
[hip-hop continues indistinctly]

05:20.695 --> 05:21.654
Ah...

05:21.696 --> 05:24.032
what is up, bitches?

05:24.073 --> 05:25.283
Like my new ride?

05:25.325 --> 05:26.326
Pimped the crap
out of it.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.579
Hey, rich girl.

05:29.620 --> 05:30.913
[laughs]
Want to go
for a ride?

05:34.375 --> 05:37.045
Please tell me that you
didn't spend your money

05:37.086 --> 05:39.297
we got from my
dad on that.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.090
Oh, my gosh, no,
of course not.

05:41.132 --> 05:43.843
You see, I just cashed
a few stocks from out
of my portfolio...

05:43.885 --> 05:45.386
Of course I got it
from your dad.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.555
How else do you think I
could afford a brand-new car?

05:47.597 --> 05:51.601
I-I thought that
you and I and Mr. C

05:51.642 --> 05:54.604
agreed that we weren't going
to draw any unnecessary...

05:54.645 --> 05:56.356
attention to ourselves.

05:56.397 --> 05:59.067
Look, it's been weeks
since you first cried
assault, OK?

05:59.108 --> 06:00.818
And nobody's
figured out jack.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.488
And besides,
this was chump change.

06:03.529 --> 06:06.491
I still have 3 mil,
easy, under my bed.

06:06.532 --> 06:07.909
You're keeping your money
under your bed?

06:07.950 --> 06:09.619
Are you...are you serious?

06:09.660 --> 06:12.455
Where else was I
supposed to put it?

06:12.497 --> 06:14.123
Yeah, a bank?

06:14.165 --> 06:16.959
Hi, Mr. Bank Manager.
I'm a 16-year-old foster kid.

06:17.001 --> 06:19.045
Do you just mind
if I deposit a few mil?

06:19.087 --> 06:20.880
Really? You don't think
that would've raised

06:20.922 --> 06:24.175
a few eyebrows?
<b></b>
Return the car.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.927
Tell your friends you stole it

06:25.968 --> 06:27.261
and then you
ditched it.

06:27.303 --> 06:28.971
You just don't get it, do you?

06:29.013 --> 06:31.265
The scam's over, all right?

06:31.307 --> 06:32.266
And I can do whatever I want

06:32.308 --> 06:35.019
with my cut.

06:35.061 --> 06:38.272
Do you know what the best part
is about this whole thing?

06:38.314 --> 06:40.233
We can go back
to hating each other.

06:40.274 --> 06:42.110
[clicks tongue]

06:42.151 --> 06:43.319
Back up, bitches.

[sighs]

06:45.071 --> 06:47.031
ANDREW:
Yes, I understand.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.199
Thank you.
I'll be in touch.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.578
What did the attorney say?

06:52.620 --> 06:54.205
He said that
it's hard to deny

06:54.247 --> 06:57.083
that Juliet has demonstrated
a certain pattern of behavior

06:57.125 --> 06:59.043
since the original
custody hearing.

06:59.085 --> 07:01.838
He thinks that if Catherine
were to sue for custody,

07:01.879 --> 07:03.840
that behavior, coupled
with her recent trauma,

07:03.881 --> 07:05.883
might give a
new jury pause.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.844
He really thinks
we could lose her?

07:07.885 --> 07:10.930
[sighs] He's just
saying that we'd have
a fight on our hands.

07:10.972 --> 07:14.642
[sighs] I can't believe
Catherine is putting
you through this.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.144
Maybe we should talk
to Juliet one more time

07:16.185 --> 07:17.603
about a new school.

07:17.645 --> 07:20.440
She's only gonna
say no again.

07:20.481 --> 07:22.608
In spite of everything, she
really likes Secor High,

07:22.650 --> 07:25.069
especially now that
Mr. Carpenter's not there.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.612
And besides, a new school

07:26.654 --> 07:28.906
wouldn't be enough of a
fresh start for Catherine.

07:32.493 --> 07:35.580
[sighs]

07:35.621 --> 07:39.750
I'm starting to question
whether she has a point or not.

07:39.792 --> 07:40.751
Maybe if I hadn't spent

07:40.793 --> 07:41.919
so much time at the office...

07:41.961 --> 07:44.213
Hey.

07:44.255 --> 07:46.257
Juliet belongs with us.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.467
End of story.

07:47.508 --> 07:49.218
Is it?

07:49.260 --> 07:51.804
Andrew, you're
an amazing father.

07:51.846 --> 07:54.640
If Catherine really wanted
to be a part of Juliet's life,

07:54.682 --> 07:56.309
then she could've stayed
in New York.

07:56.350 --> 07:59.228
But she didn't;
she moved to Miami.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.688
And she's kidding herself
if she thinks

08:00.730 --> 08:02.190
she can be half
the parent you are.

08:05.026 --> 08:07.278
I have to get
to the office.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.279
OK.

08:11.616 --> 08:12.575
Andrew.

08:14.911 --> 08:17.955
It's gonna be OK.

08:17.997 --> 08:18.956
Yeah.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.377
MALCOLM: New HFT projections
are ready to go,

08:23.419 --> 08:25.630
but I did make a few
tweaks to the program.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.173
If you have a minute,
I'll walk you through them.

08:27.215 --> 08:30.510
Oh, of course. Let me just
get settled into my office.

08:30.551 --> 08:31.928
[clears throat]

08:31.969 --> 08:34.305
Hey. Sorry. Um...

08:34.347 --> 08:36.516
receptionist wasn't at
her desk when I got here.

08:36.557 --> 08:38.559
Figured I'd make
myself at home.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.645
We didn't have an
appointment, did we?
No, no,

08:40.686 --> 08:43.147
but since when does a friend
need to make an appointment?

08:43.189 --> 08:44.565
Of course.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.859
Malcolm, I'd like you
to meet Henry Butler.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.694
Henry, meet Malcolm Ward.

08:48.736 --> 08:50.238
Malcolm's a new
employee here.

08:50.279 --> 08:52.406
Pleasure.
Likewise.

08:52.448 --> 08:53.950
If you would give us
a moment, Malcolm?

08:53.991 --> 08:55.952
Sure. Nice
meeting you.

08:55.993 --> 08:57.495
Mm, yeah.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.080
ANDREWS:
So...

08:59.121 --> 09:02.792
Henry, what can
I do for you?
<b></b>
You can cut me a check

09:02.833 --> 09:05.753
for the balance
of my portfolio.

09:05.795 --> 09:06.837
Beg your pardon?

09:06.879 --> 09:08.089
Cash me out of the fund.

09:10.716 --> 09:12.343
Uh, Henry, I'm confused.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.136
We spoke about this
a few months ago,

09:14.178 --> 09:15.555
and you decided
to stay because...

09:15.596 --> 09:18.349
A few months ago,
my wife wasn't dead.

09:18.391 --> 09:22.728
It's funny how that
can change your
outlook on things.

09:22.770 --> 09:24.480
Look, the truth
is, Andrew,

09:24.522 --> 09:27.775
I, um, I've been having what
you might call "trust issues"

09:27.817 --> 09:29.735
since Gemma died.

09:29.777 --> 09:33.114
It's hard enough maintaining
my faith in people,

09:33.155 --> 09:35.199
but the stock market...

09:35.241 --> 09:39.704
[sighs] Look, I can understand
how you must be feeling, but...

09:39.745 --> 09:41.497
it would be remiss of me
if I didn't point out...

09:41.539 --> 09:44.083
A mutual friend recently told me
that you are a crook.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.088
It's ridiculous,
I know.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.381
I-I'm not even gonna
give you his name,

09:50.423 --> 09:51.841
because I don't want
to embarrass him,

09:51.882 --> 09:54.051
but the thing is,
when I told him

09:54.093 --> 09:55.720
why I was coming
to see you today,

09:55.761 --> 09:58.389
he told me a crook...

09:58.431 --> 10:01.434
would never
give me my money back.

10:01.475 --> 10:03.019
[chuckles]
So come on,

10:03.060 --> 10:06.105
Andrew, let's show this jerk
how wrong he really is.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.317
Sounds like you've been keeping

10:09.358 --> 10:12.445
some interesting
company of late.

10:12.486 --> 10:15.031
But if you trust this
anonymous mutual friend of ours

10:15.072 --> 10:18.326
more than you do me,
let's talk to accounting

10:18.367 --> 10:20.244
and see how quickly
we can get you your money.

10:24.749 --> 10:28.586
[phone rings]

10:28.628 --> 10:29.629
Hello?

10:29.670 --> 10:31.422
MAN: Mrs. Martin?
<b></b>
Speaking.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.341
This is Canary Rose Florists
calling to confirm

10:33.382 --> 10:36.636
your delivery to Mrs. Painter
this afternoon.

10:36.677 --> 10:38.429
I'm sorry,
there must be a mistake.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.181
I didn't order any flowers.

10:40.222 --> 10:42.600
Well, according to my records,
this is a standing order

10:42.642 --> 10:44.310
that you placed back in '07.

10:44.352 --> 10:45.978
You wanted
a hundred-dollar arrangement

10:46.020 --> 10:48.439
sent to Nancy Painter
same date every year.

10:48.481 --> 10:51.359
The address is 1947 Main
in Paterson.

10:58.783 --> 11:02.203
Um...was that Paterson
as in New Jersey?

11:02.244 --> 11:03.954
[chuckles]
You know another one?

11:03.996 --> 11:05.831
Uh, no, not offhand.

11:05.873 --> 11:08.000
Uh, yeah, I-I remember
placing the order,

11:08.042 --> 11:10.461
but, um, could I trouble you
for the name one more time?

11:10.503 --> 11:11.837
Nancy Painter.

11:11.879 --> 11:13.839
[sirens wailing in distance]

11:23.224 --> 11:24.725
Hi. Uh, Canary Rose
Florists.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.769
DELIVERY MAN:
Delivery for Mrs. Painter.

11:26.811 --> 11:27.770
Thank you.
<b></b>
No problem.

11:34.527 --> 11:35.611
[engine starts]

11:37.238 --> 11:38.280
[knocking]

11:42.576 --> 11:44.620
Siobhan! My God!

11:44.662 --> 11:46.914
Oh...

11:46.956 --> 11:48.582
Oh, it's been so long.

11:49.667 --> 11:52.211
Please, uh, come in.

11:52.253 --> 11:55.005
Thank you.

11:55.047 --> 11:58.008
The flowers just got here;
aren't they beautiful?

11:58.050 --> 12:02.221
You're so sweet, remembering
my birthday every year.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.014
I hope you don't
mind me coming by.

12:04.056 --> 12:06.308
It's been a while.

12:06.350 --> 12:08.602
Hmm.

12:08.644 --> 12:12.565
You've actually been
on my mind lately.

12:12.606 --> 12:14.108
I saw your husband
on the news,

12:14.150 --> 12:16.485
all that awful business
with your stepdaughter.

12:16.527 --> 12:17.862
I thought of
reaching out;

12:17.903 --> 12:20.781
I just...I didn't want
to make things worse

12:20.823 --> 12:23.534
for either of us.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.536
Thank you.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.037
[teakettle whistling]
<b></b>
Oh, excuse me.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.247
Just a second.

12:53.355 --> 12:54.356
NANCY: You OK, dear?

12:58.819 --> 13:01.155
You're Sean's grandmother.

13:01.197 --> 13:02.448
Are you OK, Siobhan?

13:02.490 --> 13:04.742
You seem...
a little out of sorts.

13:06.535 --> 13:07.995
I'm sorry I bothered you.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.331
Um...

13:10.372 --> 13:11.332
I never should have come.

13:27.556 --> 13:31.352
BRIDGET [distant]:
...seven, eight, nine, ten.

13:31.393 --> 13:34.230
Ready or not,
here I come.

13:34.271 --> 13:35.981
Where did you go?

13:37.900 --> 13:40.069
I can't find you;
I guess you're really gone.

13:40.110 --> 13:42.488
I guess I get all
your toys, huh?
<b></b>
No, you don't!

13:42.530 --> 13:43.989
Oh, my goodness,
you scared me!

13:44.031 --> 13:45.825
Were you there
the whole time?
<b></b>
MAN: Oh, come on,

13:45.866 --> 13:48.494
Oh, my goodness.
Maybe we should go...
<b></b>
you're not being fair!

13:48.536 --> 13:49.954
WOMAN: This isn't
about you...
<b></b>
Maybe we should go

13:49.995 --> 13:51.330
play outside--
what do you think?
Yeah.

13:51.372 --> 13:53.165
Yeah? OK.

13:53.207 --> 13:55.167
Well, there's a familiar sight--

13:55.209 --> 13:57.336
Dylan's back as he walks away.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.255
What do you want, Siobhan?
You want me to stay?

13:59.296 --> 14:01.340
You want me to help out?
Because that's all I want.

14:01.382 --> 14:03.509
All I want to do is make up
for the mistakes that I made.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.302
You want to go
in that room?
We can do that.

14:05.344 --> 14:06.804
SIOBHAN:
All I want is for you to go back

14:06.846 --> 14:09.014
to hiding out in your
mom's basement in Jersey.

14:09.056 --> 14:11.976
You were good at that, and
I was a hell of a lot happier.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.352
SEAN: Where's the...?

14:13.394 --> 14:14.895
I think it's in your room.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.063
That way. Hold on.
Let me see.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.527
[door opens]

14:21.569 --> 14:22.570
[door closes]

14:26.198 --> 14:27.908
A little hard on Dylan,
don't you think?

14:27.950 --> 14:29.201
Actually, I was
just thinking

14:29.243 --> 14:31.078
I could've been harder.
<b></b>
He just wants

14:31.120 --> 14:33.330
to spend a little
time with Sean.

14:33.372 --> 14:34.915
Sure, now he does.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.250
Where was he when
Sean was born?

14:36.292 --> 14:38.544
Or the 18 months
after that?

14:38.586 --> 14:39.712
Shiv, don't you
think he...

14:39.753 --> 14:41.046
No, you don't get
a say in this.

14:44.633 --> 14:47.469
I spend more time
watching Sean than you do.

14:47.511 --> 14:49.889
Because you don't have a job.
And if I lose mine,

14:49.930 --> 14:53.017
all three of us are
out on our asses.
If Dylan comes back

14:53.058 --> 14:54.852
and I'm not around,
I want you to call the police

14:54.894 --> 14:57.938
and have him arrested
for trespassing.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.316
Oh, come on, I mean,
he's Sean's father.

15:00.357 --> 15:02.651
And I'm Sean's mother, not you.

15:06.071 --> 15:07.156
[sighs]

15:23.797 --> 15:26.008
Aren't you supposed
to be in sixth period now?

15:26.050 --> 15:28.719
Is that supposed
to be a joke?

15:28.761 --> 15:31.221
Hey, you could take the teacher
out of the school, but...

15:31.263 --> 15:34.308
[laughs]
<b></b>
All right, let's make
this quick, OK?

15:34.350 --> 15:36.060
If anyone sees us out here
together, we're both gonna have

15:36.101 --> 15:38.354
a lot of
explaining to do.

15:38.395 --> 15:42.024
You sent me a text you
wanted to talk, so talk.

15:42.066 --> 15:45.611
OK, Tessa's not...
not following the plan.

15:45.653 --> 15:48.280
I mean, she...she's spending
her money on stupid stuff

15:48.322 --> 15:50.157
and drawing attention
to herself.

15:50.199 --> 15:54.453
Define "stupid stuff."
<b></b>
She showed up at school
with a $50,000 SUV.

15:54.495 --> 15:55.871
And get this--

15:55.913 --> 15:58.457
she's hiding all
of her money under--

15:58.499 --> 15:59.708
wait for it--

15:59.750 --> 16:00.709
her bed.

16:03.587 --> 16:07.132
If she doesn't grow a brain
anytime soon,

16:07.174 --> 16:08.175
someone is going
to figure out what

16:08.217 --> 16:09.176
the three of us did.

16:11.887 --> 16:13.931
I'll take care of it.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.516
How?

16:15.557 --> 16:17.142
I don't know.

16:17.184 --> 16:18.852
I'll think of something.

16:18.894 --> 16:21.897
In the meantime, radio silence--
you don't reach out to me.

16:21.939 --> 16:23.691
Not unless you think you can
explain why you're still chummy

16:23.732 --> 16:25.401
with the guy you accused
of assaulting you.

16:31.573 --> 16:32.533
[sighs]

16:50.843 --> 16:54.346
We seriously need
to get a TV in here.

16:54.388 --> 16:55.556
What? It's, like, church quiet.

17:01.228 --> 17:03.480
SEAN [distorted]:
I want my mommy.

17:03.522 --> 17:06.358
I know you want
your mommy, kiddo,
but she's at work.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.818
And she's gonna be home
after you're asleep,

17:07.860 --> 17:10.988
but in the morning,
she'll be here to get you.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.365
[knocking]

17:13.407 --> 17:14.366
Stay here.

17:14.408 --> 17:15.367
Don't go anywhere.

17:17.828 --> 17:19.788
[both laughing]

17:22.833 --> 17:24.334
Hey, Bridget.
SEAN: Hi.

17:24.376 --> 17:26.211
[soft gasp]

17:26.253 --> 17:27.755
Dylan, you're not
supposed to be here.

17:27.796 --> 17:29.006
Yeah,

17:29.048 --> 17:31.258
I know that.
Believe me, if I'd seen

17:31.300 --> 17:33.969
Siobhan's car out front,
I would've just kept on driving.

17:34.011 --> 17:35.012
SEAN: Hi.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.346
DYLAN: It's just,

17:36.388 --> 17:39.683
um...a buddy at work
gave me two free passes

17:39.725 --> 17:41.769
to the county fair, and I was
kind of hoping to take Sean.

17:44.688 --> 17:46.065
It's the last night.

17:46.106 --> 17:47.441
I don't use 'em,
they're gonna...

17:47.483 --> 17:49.068
Dylan.

17:49.109 --> 17:50.903
I-I get why Siobhan hates me.

17:50.944 --> 17:52.571
I mean, I got her pregnant,
and then I took off.

17:52.613 --> 17:53.822
I wasn't here
when she needed me.

17:53.864 --> 17:56.784
Right? But I've
changed, OK?

17:56.825 --> 17:59.453
I came back to Tahoe, because
I want to do right by Sean.

17:59.495 --> 18:00.537
I want to be a part of his life.

18:04.541 --> 18:06.251
Come on.
Why don't you come with us?

18:06.293 --> 18:08.045
I'll spring
for the extra ticket.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.172
And I swear, I'll get you guys
back before Siobhan gets home.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.256
She'll never
even know I was here.

18:13.967 --> 18:16.386
[sighs]

18:16.428 --> 18:19.515
Give us...5 minutes.

18:19.556 --> 18:21.350
[distorted echo of closing door]

18:21.391 --> 18:23.060
What?

18:23.102 --> 18:26.939
You were staring at me,
and it was...creepy.

18:26.980 --> 18:28.982
I'm sorry, I didn't even
realize I was doing it.

18:35.030 --> 18:36.365
Dad, can I...
can I be excused?

18:36.406 --> 18:37.950
I have homework.

18:37.991 --> 18:38.951
ANDREW:
Yes.

18:48.836 --> 18:52.256
You know, I've...been thinking.

18:52.297 --> 18:56.927
Maybe sending Juliet to Miami
isn't such a bad idea.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.138
Excuse me?

18:59.179 --> 19:00.597
I don't know, maybe...

19:00.639 --> 19:04.643
Catherine really is trying
to turn over a new leaf.

19:04.685 --> 19:09.148
Juliet's been through so much
these last few months, I...

19:09.189 --> 19:11.608
I'm starting to worry that...

19:11.650 --> 19:14.528
she may need
more than I can give her.

19:14.570 --> 19:17.281
Siobhan, you've been her rock
these last few weeks.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.241
I held her hand.

19:19.283 --> 19:21.869
I-I got lucky a few times.

19:21.910 --> 19:25.205
Eventually she's
gonna need more than that.

19:25.247 --> 19:30.752
I don't want to be the reason
that she...breaks down.

19:30.794 --> 19:32.796
I'm sorry,
but weren't you the one

19:32.838 --> 19:35.132
that said to me 8 hours ago
that Juliet belonged

19:35.174 --> 19:37.009
with us?

19:37.050 --> 19:39.887
I know what I said...

19:39.928 --> 19:42.723
but at the end of the day,
I'm not her mother.

19:42.764 --> 19:45.434
You've been more of a mother
to Juliet these past 5 months

19:45.475 --> 19:46.852
than...
<b></b>
Yeah, because
they've been so awful.

19:46.894 --> 19:49.062
I mean, ever since I...

19:49.104 --> 19:51.815
Ever since you what?

19:51.857 --> 19:54.526
Nothing.
It doesn't even matter.

19:54.568 --> 19:58.030
All I'm saying is that maybe...

19:58.071 --> 20:00.199
Catherine has a point.

20:00.240 --> 20:02.034
Maybe Juliet would be
better off somewhere else.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.165
[phone rings, vibrates]

20:23.263 --> 20:24.348

20:58.048 --> 20:59.258
Chase.

20:59.299 --> 21:01.343
Hey, what's...
what's going on?

21:01.385 --> 21:02.636
What, you didn't hear?

21:02.678 --> 21:04.763
Mm-mm. Hear what?

21:04.805 --> 21:06.348
Tessa Banner got
robbed last night.

21:07.975 --> 21:09.851
Some guy pounded on her,

21:09.893 --> 21:12.062
left her for dead.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.606
Doctors put her in
one of those medically
induced comas,

21:14.648 --> 21:19.111
but...no one's sure if
she's gonna come out of it.

21:19.152 --> 21:21.822
I'll take care of it.

21:21.863 --> 21:23.657
It's messed up, right?

21:23.699 --> 21:26.034
[phone rings]

21:26.076 --> 21:27.160
Hello?

21:27.202 --> 21:28.495
DOORMAN:
Good morning, Mrs. Martin.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.372
I have a delivery man
with flowers for you.

21:30.414 --> 21:31.915
Should I send him up?

21:31.957 --> 21:33.709
Uh, yeah, please.
Thank you.

21:36.878 --> 21:37.921
[bell dings]

21:43.844 --> 21:46.013
Hello, Siobhan.

21:46.054 --> 21:47.014
Been a long time.

21:52.352 --> 21:55.939
What the hell are
you doing here?
<b></b>
Came to...

21:55.981 --> 21:59.818
return these, and to tell you
to stay away from my mother.

21:59.860 --> 22:01.820
I didn't find out about your
little birthday tradition

22:01.862 --> 22:03.196
until yesterday.

22:03.238 --> 22:05.240
She called me because
you'd never actually

22:05.282 --> 22:07.826
shown up at her
house before.

22:07.868 --> 22:10.037
I had to drive down
from Sussex to make sure
everything was OK.

22:10.078 --> 22:11.747
And now I'm here
to tell you

22:11.788 --> 22:13.582
to stay out of our lives.

22:24.634 --> 22:27.387
So I felt like visiting
an old friend.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.306
Why does it bother you so much?

22:29.348 --> 22:30.599
Uh, geez, I don't know.

22:30.640 --> 22:31.892
Maybe it has something to do
with the night

22:31.933 --> 22:33.101
that I got the crap
beat out of me

22:33.143 --> 22:35.103
by a couple of guys
back in Tahoe.

22:35.145 --> 22:37.064
Didn't take my wallet,
didn't take my car.

22:37.105 --> 22:39.858
Just wailed on me,
told me to get out of town.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.193
Any of this
sounding familiar to you?

22:43.195 --> 22:45.322
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.449
My mom
was good to you

22:47.491 --> 22:49.284
7 years ago.

22:49.326 --> 22:51.536
She came and stayed with you
after everything happened.

22:51.578 --> 22:52.579
She helped you out.

22:52.621 --> 22:54.164
Your little visit yesterday

22:54.206 --> 22:56.333
really upset her,
and she doesn't deserve that.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.293
Quite frankly, neither do I.

22:59.711 --> 23:01.004
[wry chuckle]

23:01.046 --> 23:02.172
Of course.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.757
'Cause it's always about you.

23:03.799 --> 23:05.592
You're the victim.

23:05.634 --> 23:07.386
You're the one that everyone's
supposed to feel sorry for.

23:07.427 --> 23:08.553
Right? That's how it works?

23:08.595 --> 23:09.805
Hey, I went
through hell back then.

23:09.846 --> 23:11.264
We all went through hell!

23:18.605 --> 23:19.564
Married now.

23:22.401 --> 23:25.695
So, Dylan, any kids?

23:28.156 --> 23:30.200
You want me to say
I'm sorry again, Siobhan?

23:30.242 --> 23:32.119
Because I will.

23:32.160 --> 23:35.455
You cost me everything
that meant anything to me.

23:38.500 --> 23:41.711
Bridget felt sorry for you.

23:41.753 --> 23:44.631
She tried to be kind to you,
help you out,

23:44.673 --> 23:46.425
and what did she get in return?

23:46.466 --> 23:49.219
A life of living
with the guilt of trusting you.

23:51.430 --> 23:52.931
So if it's forgiveness
you're looking for,

23:52.973 --> 23:55.350
you came to the wrong place.

23:55.392 --> 23:56.351
Get out.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.316
[elevator bell dings]

24:06.236 --> 24:08.196
[rhythmic beeping]

24:20.167 --> 24:21.126
[Juliet sighs]

24:26.756 --> 24:30.051
You a friend
of Tessa's?

24:30.093 --> 24:31.845
Sort of.

24:31.887 --> 24:34.014
I guess.

24:34.055 --> 24:37.017
Are...are you her mom?

24:37.058 --> 24:38.935
Foster.

24:38.977 --> 24:41.521
Cops keep saying this was
a burglary gone wrong.

24:41.563 --> 24:43.398
That's a load of crap.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.817
What do you mean?

24:45.859 --> 24:47.861
One day, the kid can't
afford to ride the subway.

24:47.903 --> 24:50.947
The next, she's got
a brand-new SUV.

24:50.989 --> 24:52.782
I mean, I thought maybe
she was turning tricks,

24:52.824 --> 24:54.034
but whores don't
make that much.

24:55.827 --> 24:58.497
That leaves drugs.

24:58.538 --> 24:59.956
Drugs?

24:59.998 --> 25:01.249
She must have been dealing

25:01.291 --> 25:03.877
'cause the guy
who did this to her--

25:03.919 --> 25:05.587
he didn't
take my TV

25:05.629 --> 25:07.422
or any of
my jewelry.

25:07.464 --> 25:09.966
Just whatever
was under Tessa's bed.

25:10.008 --> 25:11.885
Flipped it
right over.

25:11.927 --> 25:14.638
Obviously, she had her stash
under there.

25:14.679 --> 25:16.431
Some other dealer found out
about it and took it.

25:30.570 --> 25:33.156
Thanks again for
letting me do this.

25:33.198 --> 25:34.741
Having this time
with Sean is...

25:34.783 --> 25:35.951
I mean, I-I don't
know if I can

25:35.992 --> 25:37.369
put into words how
much it means to me.

25:38.745 --> 25:40.997
Just a bummer the rain
cut the evening short.

25:41.039 --> 25:41.998
Yeah. [chuckles]

25:44.376 --> 25:46.378
Hey, so there's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

25:46.419 --> 25:47.712
Uh, if you're
going to ask me out,

25:47.754 --> 25:49.381
you'd better stop
right there, mister.

25:49.422 --> 25:51.007
Siobhan and I
have a very strict policy

25:51.049 --> 25:54.344
about not dating guys
the other one's already dumped.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.470
Twin thing.

25:55.512 --> 25:57.305
[chuckling]
Right.

25:57.347 --> 26:00.308
Uh, no, actually, I, uh...

26:00.350 --> 26:01.434
I was wondering if you might

26:01.476 --> 26:03.895
be willing to testify
on my behalf

26:03.937 --> 26:06.106
when I petition
for partial custody of Sean.

26:08.191 --> 26:10.360
I mean, I have done
everything I can

26:10.402 --> 26:11.403
to convince Siobhan
that I deserve

26:11.444 --> 26:12.696
to be a part of his life,

26:12.737 --> 26:16.116
but no matter what I do,
it's just...

26:16.157 --> 26:17.117
And you get
it, Bridget.

26:17.158 --> 26:18.994
I know you do.

26:19.035 --> 26:22.622
He needs a dad.

26:22.664 --> 26:23.623
My lawyer says...

26:23.665 --> 26:24.624
[tires squealing, crashing]

27:23.058 --> 27:25.185
You need to tell me
what's going on.

27:25.226 --> 27:26.227
Right now.

28:12.774 --> 28:15.652
My son is dead because of you.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.195
Siobhan, I am so sorry.

28:19.489 --> 28:21.032
I know.

28:21.074 --> 28:23.743
I got your messages.

28:23.785 --> 28:25.787
And when I didn't respond,
I thought you would realize

28:25.829 --> 28:27.205
that I didn't
want you here today.

28:29.666 --> 28:33.837
At least Dylan was smart enough
not to show his face.

28:33.878 --> 28:35.755
Please don't do this.

28:35.797 --> 28:38.800
The driver that hit us
came out of nowhere.

28:38.842 --> 28:41.302
He fell asleep
at the wheel.

28:41.344 --> 28:45.098
Please, I just...I want
to be here today for you.

28:45.140 --> 28:46.641
I want to be here today
for Sean.

28:48.893 --> 28:51.396
That's too bad.

28:51.438 --> 28:52.689
Because you're
not welcome here.

28:56.568 --> 29:00.613
BRIDGET: It was almost a year
before I saw her again.

29:00.655 --> 29:02.866
It was our birthday.

29:02.907 --> 29:05.827
I went to see her.

29:05.869 --> 29:08.496
That's when I found out
that she was moving to New York.

29:10.457 --> 29:13.084
After Siobhan left...

29:13.126 --> 29:17.213
I wasn't just the party girl
that hung around till last call.

29:19.507 --> 29:22.343
The drinking became hard-core.

29:22.385 --> 29:26.222
And when that
stopped working,

29:26.264 --> 29:28.725
that's when I turned
to the drugs.

29:28.767 --> 29:29.726
And then...

29:29.768 --> 29:30.810
Bodaway Macawi.

29:33.938 --> 29:35.774
I'm sorry that I never told you
the whole truth.

29:38.443 --> 29:40.278
It's OK.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.071
The important thing
is that you're telling me now.

29:46.451 --> 29:49.204
Catherine asked for full custody
of Juliet yesterday.

29:51.956 --> 29:55.877
I told Andrew I thought
that it might be for the best.

29:55.919 --> 29:56.920
What?

29:56.961 --> 29:58.588
Why?

29:58.630 --> 30:02.717
Siobhan trusted me with Sean,
and I let her down.

30:04.928 --> 30:07.597
I couldn't let that
happen again.

30:07.639 --> 30:08.723
Your sister
gave you

30:08.765 --> 30:11.392
the greatest gift she could--

30:11.434 --> 30:13.937
her forgiveness--
and you're wasting it.

30:17.315 --> 30:18.399
Yeah, but she didn't mean it.

30:21.653 --> 30:25.740
A few days ago, I found, um...
a note that she had written.

30:27.826 --> 30:28.993
That's how I knew that she lied.

30:33.248 --> 30:36.626
I just keep thinking,
what if she only said that to me

30:36.668 --> 30:39.963
because she knew
she was going to kill herself?

30:40.004 --> 30:42.173
But she said it, Bridget.

30:42.215 --> 30:45.426
Because she saw you were in pain
and she wanted to help.

30:45.468 --> 30:47.804
Now, you have to try
to forgive yourself.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.138
[wry laugh]

30:49.180 --> 30:52.100
How on Earth am I
supposed to do that?

30:52.141 --> 30:54.644
Look what you're doing
to yourself, Bridge.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.354
If I hadn't used
that GPS app,

30:56.396 --> 30:58.314
you would have thrown a brick
through that man's window.

31:01.109 --> 31:03.069
I believe we can
bring peace to ourselves

31:03.111 --> 31:04.946
by first bringing peace
to others.

31:07.448 --> 31:08.575
Think about
what it meant

31:08.616 --> 31:11.870
to receive forgiveness
from Siobhan.

31:11.911 --> 31:13.955
I mean, really think.

31:13.997 --> 31:16.249
Not just about
what it did for you,

31:16.291 --> 31:19.502
but what it did for her.

31:19.544 --> 31:21.296
After that,
you'll know

31:21.337 --> 31:22.672
exactly what
you need to do.

31:39.063 --> 31:40.148
[door opens, bell jingles]

31:46.154 --> 31:48.114
[Juliet sobbing]

31:55.371 --> 31:56.831
[knock at door]

32:00.084 --> 32:01.794
May I come in?

32:01.836 --> 32:02.795
Yeah.

32:07.634 --> 32:10.011
Look, the, uh, school
informed us this morning

32:10.053 --> 32:12.931
that your friend Tessa
had been badly beaten.

32:12.972 --> 32:14.641
She's not my friend.

32:14.682 --> 32:17.393
Well, whatever she is,

32:17.435 --> 32:20.063
do you want to talk
about what happened?

32:20.104 --> 32:21.689
You ever wish
you could have a do-over?

32:21.731 --> 32:24.150
Like, go back in time

32:24.192 --> 32:27.070
and do the exact opposite
of everything you did?

32:29.948 --> 32:32.241
Oh, Juliet.

32:32.283 --> 32:33.785
If this is about what happened
with your teacher,

32:33.826 --> 32:35.954
you have to understand
none of it was your fault.

32:42.085 --> 32:44.921
Juliet, do you still think
you can be happy here?

32:44.963 --> 32:46.673
I love this apartment.

32:46.714 --> 32:50.551
I mean, here with me and Siobhan
in New York.

32:50.593 --> 32:53.262
As opposed to what?

32:53.304 --> 32:55.139
Hypothetically,

32:55.181 --> 32:56.849
let's say you could go live
with your mother for a while.

32:58.476 --> 32:59.811
[chuckles]

32:59.852 --> 33:04.357
OK...sure.

33:04.399 --> 33:06.901
Let's pretend for a second
that this is a universe

33:06.943 --> 33:09.070
in which my mom
actually wanted me around.

33:13.616 --> 33:16.869
Hypothetically...yeah.

33:19.956 --> 33:23.292
Change of scenery would...
probably be good.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.095
You're Malcolm, right?

33:34.137 --> 33:35.680
Henry, good
to see you again.

33:35.722 --> 33:37.181
Yeah. Hey, it's funny
running into you, actually.

33:37.223 --> 33:39.434
I stopped by your office,
but you weren't there.

33:39.475 --> 33:40.601
You're here to see me?

33:40.643 --> 33:42.520
No, I came by
to pick up this check.

33:42.562 --> 33:45.064
I don't know if Andrew told you,
but I'm leaving the fund.

33:45.106 --> 33:46.691
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.

33:46.733 --> 33:49.110
Yeah, well, the reason
I was looking for you was

33:49.152 --> 33:51.946
that Andrew mentioned that
you're sort of a computer whiz.

33:51.988 --> 33:54.198
I taught computer science
back in Wyoming,

33:54.240 --> 33:56.826
and I've done some programming
here at Martin/Charles. Why?

33:56.868 --> 33:58.995
Well, uh, my home system
is acting up,

33:59.037 --> 34:00.788
and I was wondering if maybe
you could stop by,

34:00.830 --> 34:02.582
take a look at it. I'll
compensate you for your time.

34:02.623 --> 34:04.000
I appreciate that, Henry,

34:04.042 --> 34:05.710
but it's really not the kind
of work I do.

34:05.752 --> 34:10.131
Hold on. Where's that parking
ticket? Here it is.

34:10.173 --> 34:11.299
Can I validate that, please?

34:11.340 --> 34:12.508
RECEPTIONIST:
Of course, Mr. Butler.

34:12.550 --> 34:13.551
MALCOLM:
You said you found a key.

34:13.593 --> 34:14.844
BRIDGET: Yeah, it was attached

34:14.886 --> 34:16.054
to a silver,
boat-shaped key ring,

34:16.095 --> 34:18.765
but that's gone, too, now.

There you are.

doing here?

I want to talk to you.

About?

Sean.

35:55.528 --> 35:58.281
I almost threw a brick
through your window last night.

35:58.322 --> 35:59.991
Excuse me?

36:00.032 --> 36:02.535
I saw you
last night...

36:02.577 --> 36:09.125
you and your family...
your wife and your daughter.

36:09.167 --> 36:12.295
You looked so happy.

36:12.336 --> 36:14.255
And all I could think was,

36:14.297 --> 36:15.464
"How could he move on?"

36:19.343 --> 36:21.846
And it made me hate you...

36:21.888 --> 36:25.516
more than I thought it was
possible to hate anyone.

36:25.558 --> 36:28.352
And not just for
what you did to Sean...

36:28.394 --> 36:29.562

it did to you.

Not a day goes by

36:48.414 --> 36:51.459
I could go back
and take Sean's place.

Not a single day.

Me, too.

Are you...going down?

Actually, no.
Not just yet.

Yeah, about
the other night...

38:15.501 --> 38:18.129
I spoke with Juliet
last night.

38:18.170 --> 38:22.341
I didn't tell her about
what was going on, but...

38:22.383 --> 38:24.760
I did gather
that she would be amenable

38:24.802 --> 38:28.139
to starting over someplace new.

38:28.180 --> 38:29.682
The thing is,
while I agree

38:29.724 --> 38:32.101
she may not be in
the right city...

38:32.143 --> 38:35.980
I do believe she's
with the right family.

38:36.022 --> 38:37.523
And if Catherine decides
she wants a fight,

38:37.565 --> 38:40.818

When I gave Dylan Siobhan's
forgiveness this morning,

39:34.622 --> 39:40.127
I realized what I really wanted
to give him was my own...

39:40.169 --> 39:41.128
as Bridget.

It's a feeling I've
been having a lot lately.

Especially when I'm trying
to be a wife

39:49.261 --> 39:52.973

I don't want to lie
to them constantly.

There has to be a way
that I can tell them the truth

What he did to Tessa...

40:38.102 --> 40:41.147
was all my fault.

he needed to talk to her.

she was hiding her money.
