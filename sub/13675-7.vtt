He is the dutyjudge this week,
but it's the Friday before Mardi Gras.

00:25.318 --> 00:26.979
His Honor has traditions to keep.

00:27.278 --> 00:29.189
-So he's gone for the day?
-Mmm-hmm.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.236
Who's the dutyjudge come Wednesday?

00:32.617 --> 00:33.982
Judge Ames.

00:34.285 --> 00:36.025
Oh, I really need Judge Gatling on this.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.736
I mean, I... I really need him.

00:41.042 --> 00:42.202
Galatoire's.

00:42.293 --> 00:43.658
Probably seated for an hour now,

00:43.753 --> 00:46.415
so he won't be past the appetizer, if that far.

00:46.505 --> 00:48.496
-Happy Mardi Gras.
-You, too.

00:53.179 --> 00:54.840
Ma'am, may we help you?

00:54.931 --> 00:56.512
| see my party. They're expecting me.

01:02.813 --> 01:04.189
Sorry.

01:06.984 --> 01:08.940
-Judge?
-Toni Bernette. How are you, darlin'?

01:09.028 --> 01:10.017
I'm doing very well.

01:10.112 --> 01:12.068
I know this is not
the most opportune moment,

01:12.156 --> 01:14.898
but you are the dutyjudge this week?

01:15.534 --> 01:17.911
The Friday before Mardi Gras,
you have an ex parte, Toni?

01:17.995 --> 01:20.156
-Really?
-Yeah, well, I have this...

01:20.248 --> 01:21.579
Only if you'll have a drink with us.

01:22.250 --> 01:25.162
John, Ms. Bernette here
will need a chair and her preferred drink.

01:25.253 --> 01:27.164
-Hot tea, please.
-Tea?

01:27.255 --> 01:28.665
Motion denied.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.000
Scotch, top shelf.

01:31.092 --> 01:33.583
That's my girl. Make it a double.

01:33.678 --> 01:35.839
Ms. Bernette, happy Mardi Gras.

01:35.930 --> 01:37.545
Chief Marsden, nice to see you.

01:37.640 --> 01:40.052
-Captain Rabalaise.
-Toni and I go way back.

01:40.142 --> 01:41.973
In fact, I'm her favorite target.

01:42.061 --> 01:44.097
-Thought I was.
-You guys.

01:44.188 --> 01:46.770
-Happy Mardi Gras, Toni, Judge.
-Judge.

01:48.359 --> 01:50.190
Glad they weren't reading over your shoulder.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.732
Thank you so much. Thank you.

01:56.534 --> 01:58.399
So you get out for Muses last night?

01:58.494 --> 02:00.951
-No, I didn't.
-No?

02:01.038 --> 02:03.199
-Krewe d'Etat tonight, then.
-You know,

02:03.291 --> 02:06.124
I know it's Carnival week, Your Honor,

02:06.210 --> 02:09.122
but I got a tip that the department
is gonna toss

02:09.213 --> 02:11.579
a bunch of investigative files
from just after the storm.

02:11.674 --> 02:13.915
If I don't act now, I might not get a chance.

02:14.093 --> 02:15.708
| see. And Wednesday will be too late?

02:17.513 --> 02:19.970
Judge Ames has duty next week.

02:20.057 --> 02:23.675
-Ames?
-He loves me not, Your Honor.

04:48.497 --> 04:51.455
And this is why you never wanted to
leave the 8th District, huh?

04:51.542 --> 04:53.248
One of the reasons.

04:53.335 --> 04:54.711
There's enough latitude in CID

04:54.795 --> 04:57.628
that we both crept down here
in the middle of the day.

04:57.715 --> 04:59.205
I guess so.

04:59.383 --> 05:00.919
Oh! Oh!

05:03.387 --> 05:07.551
I wonder if the guys walking a foot post
in Sodom and Gomorrah felt lucky.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.802
-I fucking bet they did.
-Yeah, but you know what?

05:09.894 --> 05:13.478
I've come to believe that
there's a big difference between vice and sin.

05:14.023 --> 05:16.639
New Orleans gets it. The rest of the world...

05:17.902 --> 05:19.312
What's the difference?

05:19.403 --> 05:22.145
Well, vice... You know, vice, it's human.

05:22.239 --> 05:24.696
It's one drink too many.

05:24.783 --> 05:28.196
It's an illegal smile in a coat pocket.

05:28.287 --> 05:29.527
It's a bet on a wrong horse.

05:29.622 --> 05:32.910
It's a wrong prick rubbing against
a wrong piece of ass.

05:33.292 --> 05:35.157
-And sin?
-Well, sin...

05:35.252 --> 05:38.085
Sin is those bodies over in Central City,

05:38.172 --> 05:41.255
the ones that we just keep rolling up on
and doing so goddamn little about.

05:45.012 --> 05:48.470
I heard you busted on Bidwell the other day,
because he didn't clean his unmarked unit.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.347
l busted on Bidwell,
because Bidwell is a piece of shit,

05:54.438 --> 05:56.850
who can't solve a case to save his fuckin' ass,

05:56.941 --> 05:59.057

Terry, if you keepjumping in their shit,
they're gonna think you ain't on the team.

06:08.661 --> 06:10.276
Fair warning, Terry.

06:19.296 --> 06:21.833
Well, it sounds stupid, but...

06:24.134 --> 06:25.260
What's bugging you?

06:26.136 --> 06:28.798
-How do you do it?
-Do what? Run a restaurant?

06:29.014 --> 06:31.221
-You know how to run a restaurant.
-No, I mean everything else.

06:31.308 --> 06:32.844
I mean, I don't know...

06:32.935 --> 06:36.974
The promo stuff, the interviews,
the dog and pony shows.

06:37.064 --> 06:40.898
I mean, they want me
to go on The Today Show with Al Roker,

06:40.985 --> 06:44.227

that I gotta cook something

-Where to?

06:56.834 --> 06:58.415
A restaurant.

06:58.502 --> 07:01.209
Which one of your many fine establishments
do you want me to see?

07:01.297 --> 07:02.582
No, no, this won't take long.

07:02.673 --> 07:05.005
-Five minutes. Come on.
-Okay.

-Hillary?
-She was good in the Senate.

07:07.886 --> 07:09.751

it's all over but the shouting.

-Tuesday? Mardi Gras?
-Down here, it's Mardi Gras.

07:14.018 --> 07:17.385
But for the rest of the country,
it's 22 primaries and Super Tuesday.

any more work before Ash Wednesday,

07:26.655 --> 07:30.364

by 10:00 AM.

-You remember?
-Sure, I do.

08:14.286 --> 08:15.822
Well, you see, they made a choice.

08:15.913 --> 08:19.076
Anthony and Gail made a choice
to stay on Baronne Street

08:19.166 --> 08:21.077
and keep their hands
on what they were serving.

08:21.418 --> 08:22.498
They cooked.

08:22.586 --> 08:25.453
Every day they cooked,
until they could cook no more.

08:25.547 --> 08:27.378
-It was great.
-But it was one choice.

08:27.758 --> 08:30.374
And the other choice is what? Getting bigger?

08:30.511 --> 08:32.251
More tables, more restaurants?

08:32.513 --> 08:35.505
Less time at the stove,
more time in the pass, other people cooking?

08:35.599 --> 08:37.681
Well, the other choice is that
you can build something big,

08:37.768 --> 08:39.258
but keep it the way that you wanna keep it.

08:39.436 --> 08:43.020
Take those ideas
and try to execute them to the highest level.

around you now, right?

08:46.652 --> 08:48.984
Or what I should say is that you're the ship,

08:49.071 --> 08:50.527
and all these people that look up to you

08:50.614 --> 08:53.276
and wanna be around you,
they're living on the ship

08:53.367 --> 08:55.153
and they're saying,
"Oh The ship is doing good.

"Oh, the ship is going to
some interesting places.

isn't going down,

-Yeah, fuck you, Chef. That's the way it is.

and to take care of these people.

09:11.802 --> 09:13.758
Just do it.

09:18.434 --> 09:20.800
-So is it worth it?
-Yeah.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.179

for a demo company that can handle it.

he is hurting himself?

I'm sure you can see how she might be
projecting something onto a man who's older.

And you can see that there's a reason

23:28.491 --> 23:30.777
we hadn't met until today,

23:30.868 --> 23:37.034
that, on some level, Sofia understands
that she's in a relationship that is...

before handing the case over
to Dr. Minyard and his people.

that Henry was murdered,

that his death was a homicide.

Yeah.

1:01:49.790 --> 1:01:53.908
But instead I have this right here,

1:01:55.337 --> 1:01:58.704
which opens this restaurant
and its fully stocked bar,

1:01:58.799 --> 1:02:04.260
on the top shelf of which sits
a full bottle of anejo tequila.

1:02:05.014 --> 1:02:06.550
And you know where I live, Davis?

1:02:06.640 --> 1:02:09.177
You know where fuckin' Feeny stashed me?

1:02:10.144 --> 1:02:12.635
Seventh floor, right above the place,

1:02:12.730 --> 1:02:15.096
so I can never get far enough away.

1:02:16.817 --> 1:02:19.650
Come on, let's get more happyjuice.

1:02:21.488 --> 1:02:24.025
Yeah, good idea.

1:02:30.831 --> 1:02:33.163
And this one is just right.

1:02:33.626 --> 1:02:34.615
(POLICE RADIO CHATTER)

1:02:34.960 --> 1:02:36.496
Why aren't their lights flashing?

1:02:40.174 --> 1:02:42.506
-What's going on here?
-I didn't see anything, man.

1:02:44.094 --> 1:02:45.800
No ambulance, Terry.

1:02:45.888 --> 1:02:46.968
TERRY: Yeah.

1:02:50.017 --> 1:02:51.848
I didn't do nothing, man.

1:02:52.353 --> 1:02:53.718
Relax. We're getting you an ambulance.

1:02:53.812 --> 1:02:55.518
4101 to dispatch.

1:02:56.106 --> 1:02:57.767
What's your location?

1:02:58.317 --> 1:03:02.276
Let's start an EMS to the Beachcorner,
4905 Canal Street.

1:03:03.364 --> 1:03:05.104
You said you saw a gun?

1:03:05.532 --> 1:03:06.658
I don't know, man.

1:03:06.742 --> 1:03:08.949
So it was you who had that fuckin' gun
on the ground right there?

1:03:09.036 --> 1:03:11.698
No. I didn't have no gun. No way.

1:03:11.789 --> 1:03:13.620
-You see a gun?
-Yeah.

1:03:13.707 --> 1:03:15.447
-Where?
-Right there.

1:03:15.542 --> 1:03:16.873
So it was him that had the gun?

1:03:17.920 --> 1:03:19.126
All right, come on, man.

1:03:26.470 --> 1:03:28.176
How many shootings
we catch this Mardi Gras?

1:03:28.263 --> 1:03:29.878
-How fuckin' many?
-Five, I think.

1:03:30.224 --> 1:03:31.839
Eight or nine wounded.

1:03:31.934 --> 1:03:33.674
And in the wake of that
happy little bloodletting,

1:03:33.769 --> 1:03:38.103
what is NOPD doing on Mardi Gras night
to occupy its time?

1:03:38.399 --> 1:03:40.310
Getting in a fucking bar fight.

1:03:40.401 --> 1:03:43.063
We're beating the fuck
out of uniformed transit officers.

1:03:45.406 --> 1:03:47.818
Bus drivers, Anthony.

1:03:47.908 --> 1:03:50.820
We're beating down fucking bus drivers!

1:03:52.454 --> 1:03:54.410
Now we're tossing drop guns on 'em.

1:03:55.457 --> 1:03:58.073
Jesus. Do you believe in that karma shit?

1:03:59.044 --> 1:04:02.002
That we create our own circumstances?

1:04:02.089 --> 1:04:03.420
No.

1:04:03.507 --> 1:04:04.838
Something is coming, Tony.

1:04:04.925 --> 1:04:10.136
Something big and ugly and overdue.

1:04:10.222 --> 1:04:11.587
What do you mean?

1:04:12.266 --> 1:04:13.597
Keep yourself clean.

1:04:13.684 --> 1:04:14.924
What the fuck are you talking about?

1:04:15.310 --> 1:04:16.891
Something is coming,

1:04:18.313 --> 1:04:20.178
so stay clean of this shit.

1:04:32.161 --> 1:04:34.117
(MOANING)

1:04:38.959 --> 1:04:40.495
Okay, wait.

1:04:42.212 --> 1:04:43.497
No thinking, okay? No thinking.

1:04:43.589 --> 1:04:45.750
-It's a Mardi Gras fuck. I know.
-Yeah.

1:04:45.841 --> 1:04:49.049
You got your girl. I like her. She's nice.

1:04:49.386 --> 1:04:51.718
I got my restaurant,
whatever the fuck that means.

1:04:51.930 --> 1:04:53.010
So it doesn't count, right?

1:04:53.098 --> 1:04:55.635
Yeah. I own a restaurant.
You don't like her. Doesn't count.

1:04:55.726 --> 1:04:58.889
-No, I like her.
-Okay. I know. Doesn't count.

1:04:58.979 --> 1:05:00.094
-It's not even happening.
-(SHUSHING)

1:05:00.189 --> 1:05:02.555
This isn't... We're not even here.

1:05:02.649 --> 1:05:04.685
-That's better.
-Okay?

1:05:04.777 --> 1:05:07.393
It doesn't count, all right?

1:05:08.322 --> 1:05:10.483
-Wow. These are tight.
-I got it.

1:05:10.574 --> 1:05:11.984

1:05:21.335 --> 1:05:22.700
Okay.

1:05:23.837 --> 1:05:25.338
-I can't get 'em.
-What?

1:05:25.464 --> 1:05:27.045
-(LAUGHS)
-Shh.
