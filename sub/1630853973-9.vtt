Captain's log, stardate 58496.1.

00:27.505 --> 00:29.725
While the primary mission
of the California-class

00:29.768 --> 00:31.640
is second contact,

00:31.683 --> 00:35.035
Starfleet has never considered
our work a top priority.

00:35.078 --> 00:37.037
Until today.

00:37.080 --> 00:40.736
I'm thrilled to log that my
planetary follow-up initiative

00:40.779 --> 00:44.348
has finally been given the green
light by Admiral Buenamigo.

00:44.392 --> 00:46.176
Congratulations,
Captain Freeman.

00:46.220 --> 00:49.136
There's no one better suited
for Project Swing By.

00:49.179 --> 00:52.226
And there's no one better suited
to assign it to me, Admiral.

set this conversation to facts.

00:55.403 --> 00:57.753

The first Project Swing By
planet you'll be checking in on

00:59.929 --> 01:01.496
is Ornara.

01:01.539 --> 01:04.586
Ornara. Picard made
first contact there, right?

01:04.629 --> 01:06.501
Yes. 17 years ago.

01:06.544 --> 01:08.590
So they're long overdue
for some Starfleet attention.

01:08.633 --> 01:11.854
If this goes well, Swing By
missions will be assigned

01:11.897 --> 01:14.291
across the entire
California-class.

01:14.335 --> 01:17.207
Then I'll make sure
it goes better than well.

01:17.251 --> 01:20.123
I know you will. Which is why
I have a journalist from FNN

01:20.167 --> 01:21.994
en route to theCerritos.

01:22.038 --> 01:24.475
She'll be documenting
your success as it happens.

What do we know
about the Ornarans?

03:14.106 --> 03:16.108
They were ravaged by a plague,

03:16.152 --> 03:18.459
the cure for which was
a plant called felicium,

03:18.502 --> 03:20.635
which only grew
on their sister planet, Brekka.

03:20.678 --> 03:22.767
The Brekkians exploited access
to the drug

03:22.811 --> 03:24.421

Well, Captain,
think about it like this--

03:49.359 --> 03:51.622
if they've relapsed,
we'll provide much-needed aid.

I know that
your people's first contact

08:46.613 --> 08:48.702

had its difficulties,

08:48.745 --> 08:50.138
-but we're here t...
-What?

08:50.181 --> 08:52.053
Oh. You're worried
that things got bad

08:52.096 --> 08:53.837
when Picard cut us off
from the felicium.

08:53.881 --> 08:55.578
Well, uh... did they?

08:55.622 --> 08:58.059
No. Picard was absolutely right.

08:58.102 --> 08:59.756
It was the best thing
that ever happened to us.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.845
Look. We even made a mural.

09:01.889 --> 09:04.108
See, there's the Enterprise
leaving us with no drugs,

09:04.152 --> 09:06.067
and here's all of us
freaking out.

09:06.110 --> 09:08.112
We were in a bit of a bad place
for the first, oh,

09:08.156 --> 09:09.505
ten, 14 years,

09:09.549 --> 09:11.028
but we figured it out.

09:11.072 --> 09:12.682
Once we shook
the old demons out, we focused

09:12.726 --> 09:14.641
on healthy diet and fitness.

09:14.684 --> 09:17.034
You could say
we're addicted to that now.

09:19.950 --> 09:21.256
How much you bench?

09:21.299 --> 09:22.605
Oh, we don't do it
for the numbers.

09:22.649 --> 09:24.085
We do it to quiet
the voices in our heads.

09:24.128 --> 09:26.000
Nice. I do 250.

09:26.043 --> 09:29.699
So, B'Nir, you have Starfleet
at your full disposal.

09:29.743 --> 09:32.354
How may we be of assistance?

09:32.397 --> 09:33.442
Yeah, we're good.

09:33.485 --> 09:34.617
Well, there must be something.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.053
We have medical supplies,

09:36.097 --> 09:37.402
engineering know-how,

09:37.446 --> 09:38.795
unlimited snacks.
