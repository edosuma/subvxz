"The Book of Eli"

09:01.183 --> 09:03.319
You hungry?

09:03.320 --> 09:04.659
You know you've
got to come get it.

09:04.660 --> 09:06.922
Don't play hard to get.

09:06.923 --> 09:09.014
You will like it.

09:09.015 --> 09:11.735
It's cat...

09:13.161 --> 09:14.580
There you go.

09:21.565 --> 09:24.359
Leave room
for breakfast.

10:07.538 --> 10:10.737
<i>I can think of
younger days</i>

10:11.986 --> 10:16.225
<i>when living for my life</i>

10:17.229 --> 10:23.409
<i>Was everything a man
could want to do</i>

10:25.008 --> 10:34.339
<i>I could never
see tomorrow</i>

10:34.340 --> 10:38.938
<i>I was never told</i>

10:38.939 --> 10:44.890
<i>about the sorrow</i>

10:49.988 --> 10:53.544
<i>How can you mend</i>

10:53.545 --> 10:57.397
<i>a broken heart?</i>

11:00.472 --> 11:03.100
<i>How can you
stop the rain</i>

11:03.101 --> 11:06.306
<i>from falling down?</i>

11:08.021 --> 11:12.484
<i>How can you stop</i>

11:14.088 --> 11:18.916
<i>the sun from shining?</i>

11:18.964 --> 11:25.302
<i>What makes the
world go round?</i>

12:24.172 --> 12:26.116
Hello?

12:29.693 --> 12:31.792
Hello?

12:39.426 --> 12:40.687
Please...

12:40.688 --> 12:42.482
don't hurt me.

12:42.483 --> 12:44.319
Here, take anything
you want.

12:44.320 --> 12:45.748
You want some food?

12:46.706 --> 12:47.762
Take it.

12:50.519 --> 12:52.669
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Yeah?

12:52.670 --> 12:54.809
That's what the
last guy said.

12:58.485 --> 12:59.901
Could you help me?

13:00.102 --> 13:01.704
The wheel came off.

13:01.705 --> 13:04.038
I can't fix it.

13:04.039 --> 13:07.480
Maybe if I...
if I could...

13:07.481 --> 13:08.482
but I can't.

13:09.994 --> 13:14.113
The only good thing
about no soap ...

13:14.114 --> 13:18.119
is that you can smell
hijackers a mile off.

13:19.498 --> 13:21.173
I am impressed!

13:21.174 --> 13:23.090
This man ...

13:23.091 --> 13:24.974
smelled us...

13:24.975 --> 13:27.247
from thirty feet away!

13:28.990 --> 13:31.999
What does that say
about our hygiene?

13:33.635 --> 13:35.683
What you got there
in that pack?

13:35.984 --> 13:37.585
What pack?

13:37.720 --> 13:39.853
He's got a gun.

13:40.315 --> 13:42.555
Well shit, it
ain't loaded.

13:43.371 --> 13:46.498
They never are.

13:46.499 --> 13:48.642
Ain't that right,
old man?

13:52.377 --> 13:54.064
Open the pack and
tip it out on the road.

13:54.065 --> 13:55.465
Nice and slow.

13:57.971 --> 13:59.953
Can't do that.

14:02.898 --> 14:05.541
Take off the
fucking pack...

14:05.542 --> 14:08.178
and put it on
the ground...

14:08.179 --> 14:09.895
or die!

14:13.669 --> 14:15.642
Are you listening to me?

14:15.643 --> 14:18.687
- I am now.
- Good.

14:18.688 --> 14:20.936
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

14:20.937 --> 14:22.336
Good.

14:22.337 --> 14:23.441
Put that hand
on me again,

14:23.442 --> 14:25.087
and you wont
get it back.

14:29.281 --> 14:31.885
Can you believe
this fucking guy?

14:32.459 --> 14:34.302
Alright, we will do
it the hard way.

14:42.409 --> 14:44.459
Why did you do that?

14:44.460 --> 14:46.734
You just cut my hand off!

14:51.069 --> 14:53.726
What are you standing
around for?

14:53.727 --> 14:54.727
Kiss him!

14:56.395 --> 14:58.142
What did he say?

14:58.143 --> 15:00.141
He's in shock.

15:02.217 --> 15:04.522
I think he meant
"Kill him".

15:40.647 --> 15:44.008
I told you you weren't
gonna get that back.

15:50.094 --> 15:53.109
Yeah, you did.

15:59.387 --> 16:01.546
Who are you?

17:26.876 --> 17:27.958
Where's your water?

17:28.836 --> 17:31.300
They don't have none.
They were gonna take yours, ...

17:31.301 --> 17:33.024
and then eat you.

17:33.025 --> 17:34.325
It's true.

17:39.425 --> 17:42.141
It's in the cart.

18:12.591 --> 18:14.295
You're not taking it?

18:15.129 --> 18:17.627
- Where are you going?
- West.

18:18.053 --> 18:20.599
- Can I come with you?
- No.

19:13.650 --> 19:15.307
<i>No!</i>

19:19.733 --> 19:22.959
<i>Woah, woah, woah...
Where are you going?</i>

19:29.133 --> 19:31.463
Stay on the path.

19:33.305 --> 19:34.943
<i>No!</i>

19:35.805 --> 19:40.361
Stay on the path.
It's not your concern.

19:42.426 --> 19:47.335
Stay on the path.
It's not your concern.

21:45.274 --> 21:46.185
- I don't know you.

21:46.486 --> 21:47.883
I know.
I'm not from around here.

21:48.026 --> 21:50.091
No shit, you're not from around
here. Who are you?

21:50.092 --> 21:51.509
I don't want any trouble.

21:54.162 --> 21:55.674
Okay.

21:57.976 --> 22:01.889
- Just a customer, okay?
- Okay.

22:04.966 --> 22:07.769
I'm sorry I gotta
see the hands.

22:08.622 --> 22:11.044
I'm not one of them.

22:11.244 --> 22:13.127
Okay.

22:13.569 --> 22:14.900
I'm gonna take something
out of my pack.

22:16.873 --> 22:18.005
Take your finger
off the trigger.

22:18.066 --> 22:19.006
Yeah.

22:27.667 --> 22:31.486
Oh, sweet. That's
a Fathom 900, man.

22:31.487 --> 22:32.787
Is it?

22:32.788 --> 22:34.843
I haven't seen one of
those since the 90's.

22:34.844 --> 22:36.144
Yeah, I got it
back east.

22:36.145 --> 22:37.947
- Does it still work?
- Yeah, just need a charge.

22:38.662 --> 22:39.839
Can you do that
for me? Give me a charge.

22:40.053 --> 22:41.398
I got cables.

22:41.822 --> 22:44.094
I don't need the cables.
I can put a trickle charger on it.

22:44.165 --> 22:45.095
Good.

22:47.076 --> 22:48.946
I need to get the coin.

22:52.010 --> 22:53.961
Yes I do.

22:59.856 --> 23:01.923
- It's American.
- Oh yeah.

23:01.924 --> 23:04.526
I got a whole
bunch of these.

23:04.527 --> 23:06.315
How about Chapstick?
Got any Chapstick?

23:06.316 --> 23:08.409
No Chapstick.
I got cat oil.

23:08.410 --> 23:11.299
- Fresh cat oil.
- No, no.

23:11.300 --> 23:13.548
It's good, it's good for...

23:13.549 --> 23:14.498
Works the same way.

23:14.499 --> 23:16.964
What about toys?
Got any toys?

23:16.965 --> 23:20.103
No, I don't play.
Oh, I got...

23:22.936 --> 23:25.217
Oh yeah.
Yeah yeah.

23:27.378 --> 23:28.631
Okay, alright.

23:29.420 --> 23:31.940
I'll have this,
with these.

23:31.941 --> 23:33.748
Oh, absolutely,
those are yours.

23:33.749 --> 23:36.024
Okay, give me a
couple of hours.

23:36.025 --> 23:37.863
- I'll charge it up for you
- Thank you.

23:37.864 --> 23:40.880
You can wait over there,
across the street at The Orphan

23:40.881 --> 23:44.449
- No, I'm good.
- The bar is about ready to open.

23:44.450 --> 23:45.648
I'll wait here.

23:45.649 --> 23:47.519
You dont trust
me, do you?

23:51.680 --> 23:54.234
- I'll wait here.
- Alright.

24:32.271 --> 24:37.484
Carnie, one of the road
crews just pulled into town.

24:37.485 --> 24:39.735
They got something
for you.

24:39.736 --> 24:43.055
- Books?
- A whole pack of them.

24:43.887 --> 24:47.457
Tell them I wanna
see them. Right now.

25:00.650 --> 25:03.049
We did good.

25:13.031 --> 25:17.761
The one you want.
It ain't there?

25:19.314 --> 25:20.924
No.

25:20.925 --> 25:23.871
I just dont understand.
That's a shitload of books.

25:23.872 --> 25:27.181
You don't have
to understand.

25:27.759 --> 25:29.270
I understand.

25:29.271 --> 25:32.136
Leave that to me and
we can be friends.

25:32.137 --> 25:35.873
I have faith in you.
You will find it.

25:36.269 --> 25:38.641
Ah, wait!

25:38.642 --> 25:41.665
I got this too.

25:46.768 --> 25:51.065
Oh, now this is a treat.

25:52.049 --> 25:54.817
It's shampoo.

25:56.682 --> 26:01.090
Go get slammed.
Get some pussy.

26:01.091 --> 26:04.782
Everything on me as much as
you and your boys can stand.

26:04.783 --> 26:07.470
Then go back on the road.

26:07.471 --> 26:10.185
Then we'll get you your book!

26:10.186 --> 26:12.416
Of that I have no doubt.

26:17.770 --> 26:20.705
You're sending guys out
that can't even read

26:20.706 --> 26:23.025
to look for one book.

26:24.147 --> 26:26.286
No wonder they
never find anything.

26:26.421 --> 26:28.288
Yeah, I use the
tools I have at hand.

26:29.374 --> 26:31.850
Unless you'd like
to go with them.

26:37.714 --> 26:41.520
- What about these?
- Burn them.

26:42.838 --> 26:46.348
The place across the street -
they got any water?

26:49.389 --> 26:51.920
They have if you
can pay for it.

26:57.011 --> 27:01.738
Here. Smell this.

27:06.717 --> 27:09.833
One of the road crews found it.

27:10.591 --> 27:13.079
Who knows...

27:14.288 --> 27:18.913
It might be the last
shampoo on the planet.

27:19.557 --> 27:23.311
And it's yours.

27:26.567 --> 27:28.970
Did they find your book?

27:31.986 --> 27:34.268
No.

28:16.124 --> 28:17.695
Outlander?

28:18.948 --> 28:20.504
Let me see.

28:23.682 --> 28:26.943
- Alright, what will it be?
- Water.

28:28.476 --> 28:30.661
That's the good stuff.

28:30.662 --> 28:32.393
I gotta eat into
my own rations to sell,

28:32.394 --> 28:34.583
so it don't come cheap.

28:43.415 --> 28:45.714
That will get you
maybe half way.

29:08.014 --> 29:09.700
Solara!

29:13.035 --> 29:15.798
Take this and get it filled.

29:18.964 --> 29:22.239
Wait. You need this.

29:38.702 --> 29:40.698
Can you please move?

29:44.087 --> 29:45.736
Thank you.

30:00.511 --> 30:03.028
That was my cat.

30:05.268 --> 30:08.097
Fine specimen.

30:08.098 --> 30:10.058
I saw you knock
him off the bar.

30:10.189 --> 30:13.013
No, I kinda shoo'd it,
I didnt really knock it.

30:13.014 --> 30:14.518
You raised your
hand at him.

30:14.519 --> 30:16.650
Won't happen again,
I promise you.

30:16.651 --> 30:19.812
Hey Martz, how about
another drink?

30:20.744 --> 30:23.797
That cat's been coming
in here for 2 years.

30:24.469 --> 30:27.748
It's got more right
to be here than you.

30:28.343 --> 30:30.817
I don't want any trouble.

30:32.476 --> 30:35.121
That's too bad,
cause you...

30:41.669 --> 30:44.350
I know who you are.

30:44.351 --> 30:48.907
Murderer of innocent
travelers on the road.

30:49.308 --> 30:52.036
You are going to be
held to account

30:52.037 --> 30:55.136
for the things you've
done, do you know that?

30:59.914 --> 31:01.670
It's okay.

31:05.921 --> 31:09.835
I'm gonna grab my things,
and walk out of here.

31:09.836 --> 31:13.117
- Alright, brother?
- Yeah.

31:53.085 --> 31:58.231
Cursed be the ground,
for our sake.

31:59.184 --> 32:06.480
Of thorns and thistles, it
shall bring forth, for us.

32:06.781 --> 32:08.055
For out of the ground
we were taken

32:08.056 --> 32:10.231
for the dust we are.

32:12.914 --> 32:16.200
And to the dust
we shall return.

32:44.437 --> 32:45.875
Stop!

32:48.354 --> 32:49.988
Please.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.635
Redridge!

33:02.943 --> 33:05.156
Redridge.

33:18.647 --> 33:23.002
- And who are you?
- Nobody.

33:24.099 --> 33:26.280
Oh, I doubt that.

33:26.281 --> 33:29.030
The men you killed in my bar.

33:29.031 --> 33:30.631
They were nobody.

33:31.592 --> 33:33.951
- But you now...
- He ain't got the shakes.

33:33.952 --> 33:35.919
He ain't one of them.

33:35.920 --> 33:39.228
Good. This is a
civilized town.

33:39.229 --> 33:40.229
We don't eat humans.

33:42.430 --> 33:44.943
We don't see too many
people from before.

33:44.944 --> 33:46.725
Not anymore.

33:48.120 --> 33:51.217
- Do you read?
- Every day.

33:52.980 --> 33:55.332
How good for you.
Me too.

33:55.333 --> 33:56.868
You know what's funny?

33:56.869 --> 34:00.410
As old as we are,
people like you and me,

34:00.411 --> 34:01.911
we're the future.

34:02.437 --> 34:04.169
What do you want with me?

34:04.695 --> 34:07.592
Straight to the point.

34:07.593 --> 34:08.330
I like that.

34:09.570 --> 34:10.364
I like that.

34:15.742 --> 34:18.476
You're not just educated.

34:19.069 --> 34:21.362
I never saw anyone handle
themselves the way you did

34:21.362 --> 34:22.661
I dont know
where you learned it,

34:22.661 --> 34:25.382
but I sure as
hell could use it.

34:26.464 --> 34:30.139
It's a little town,
is just the beginning.

34:30.141 --> 34:33.297
Im about to expand.
I need expert help.

34:33.297 --> 34:35.003
I could use
someone like you.

34:35.262 --> 34:38.387
Thank you. But I'm
really not interested.

34:39.217 --> 34:40.342
People who work for
me live better than

34:40.342 --> 34:42.514
any worker dreamed.
Ask Redridge, here.

34:42.514 --> 34:44.619
Ask the boys, anyone.

34:45.313 --> 34:48.025
Real beds,
hot food, women.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.571
Clean water.

34:53.286 --> 34:55.764
You could do a lot
worse, my friend.

34:57.123 --> 34:58.382
Thank you.

35:00.030 --> 35:02.117
But I got
somewhere I need to be.

35:02.546 --> 35:03.881
Where?

35:05.046 --> 35:06.337
West.

35:06.758 --> 35:08.606
There is nothing west.

35:08.607 --> 35:10.715
I've been told different.

35:10.716 --> 35:12.484
By who?

35:17.440 --> 35:21.187
Tell you what.
Stay the night.

35:21.188 --> 35:22.674
Try a little of
our hospitality,

35:22.675 --> 35:24.340
See how you like it.

35:24.350 --> 35:26.904
We'll talk again
in the morning.

35:26.905 --> 35:30.345
Word of advice, Walker.
It's not a choice.

35:32.089 --> 35:34.413
There's always a choice.

35:38.139 --> 35:41.394
There'll be someone
outside your room all night.

35:41.395 --> 35:45.361
- If you need anything.
- I dont need anything.

35:45.362 --> 35:47.228
You never know.

36:38.325 --> 36:41.841
This is for you. It's
water for washing

36:41.842 --> 36:44.346
and some food, some
special dessert too,

36:44.347 --> 36:46.284
compliments of the house.

36:51.146 --> 36:52.390
I need you to take
this or say something,

36:52.391 --> 36:54.119
so I can find you.

37:06.558 --> 37:09.939
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

37:09.940 --> 37:11.275
Can I get you
anything else?

37:11.276 --> 37:12.878
No, I'm fine, thank you.

37:12.879 --> 37:15.314
You get blinded in the war?
Or the sun after?

37:18.583 --> 37:21.126
I was born this way.

37:21.127 --> 37:22.752
I think probably I'm
lucky because I was

37:22.753 --> 37:24.640
already used to being
like this by the time

37:24.641 --> 37:26.868
it happened.

37:26.869 --> 37:30.207
Well, thank you,
for the food.

37:30.208 --> 37:31.609
You're welcome.

37:33.794 --> 37:35.917
I like your perfume.

37:40.304 --> 37:45.784
It's just shampoo.
But thank you.

37:47.495 --> 37:48.909
Good night.

38:12.817 --> 38:14.237
I don't think he's
going to change his mind

38:14.238 --> 38:15.898
by the morning.

38:17.201 --> 38:19.279
He's not gonna stay.

38:23.428 --> 38:25.918
He's different
than the others.

38:26.733 --> 38:28.021
You're not gonna be
able to make him do

38:28.022 --> 38:30.280
what you want him to do.

38:32.346 --> 38:35.248
Who said anything about me?

38:37.129 --> 38:39.869
I'll send Solara.

38:42.962 --> 38:44.992
You can't do that.

38:44.993 --> 38:49.561
It's about time I got
better use out of her.

38:50.857 --> 38:54.767
Don't do that... Please.

38:54.768 --> 38:58.663
Please, dont. Please.

39:14.361 --> 39:15.920
Can I come in?

39:18.584 --> 39:20.102
Give me a minute.

39:29.102 --> 39:32.676
Somebody already came
with food and water.

39:34.602 --> 39:36.773
I got everything
I need.

39:41.001 --> 39:42.868
Are you sure
about that?

39:46.727 --> 39:49.221
It's really bright in here.

39:50.465 --> 39:53.523
- I'm Solara.
- Right

39:53.524 --> 39:56.254
You filled my canteen
downstairs.

39:56.487 --> 39:59.783
Yeah. You're that
walker, right?

40:00.439 --> 40:01.768
Right.

40:05.021 --> 40:08.998
If you're worried about
paying its on the house.

40:08.999 --> 40:10.879
Paying for what?

40:12.637 --> 40:14.570
Why don't you
take a seat?

40:24.620 --> 40:25.361
No.

40:27.614 --> 40:28.958
No, I can't go.

40:29.282 --> 40:32.215
I can't.
If I do he'll hurt my mom.

40:32.732 --> 40:35.498
- Who?
- Carnegie.

40:36.714 --> 40:40.233
- He's your father?
- No

40:40.234 --> 40:42.797
We belong to him
just the same.

40:42.798 --> 40:44.940
I'll sleep on
the floor.

40:44.941 --> 40:45.999
Tomorrow you can
tell him you had

40:46.000 --> 40:50.285
a good time. I promise you,
I will be no trouble.

40:53.289 --> 40:55.014
Please.

41:01.360 --> 41:06.539
Knight to b4.

41:13.124 --> 41:15.337
Your move.

41:21.761 --> 41:26.643
- So... how old are you?
- Excuse me?

41:26.644 --> 41:28.552
I havent really seen
too many people

41:28.553 --> 41:31.137
your age come
through here before.

41:31.663 --> 41:35.353
Well, it's been...

41:38.211 --> 41:41.783
30 winters since
the flash.

41:43.980 --> 41:46.474
I really dont remember.

41:46.994 --> 41:48.962
Do you remember
what it was like?

41:49.822 --> 41:52.773
- In the world before.
- Yeah

41:56.320 --> 41:58.410
What was it like?

42:02.224 --> 42:04.918
People had more
than they needed.

42:06.587 --> 42:12.086
We had no idea what was
precious and what wasn't.

42:16.062 --> 42:17.838
We threw away things
that people would

42:17.839 --> 42:19.772
kill each other for now.

42:21.795 --> 42:23.934
- Really?
- Yeah.

42:25.996 --> 42:28.374
You have a book.
Can I see it?

42:28.375 --> 42:29.682
No, you cannot.

42:29.683 --> 42:32.065
I just want to
look at it.

42:32.066 --> 42:35.962
I can't even read, please
let me just see it.

42:36.706 --> 42:38.522
What is with you?
It is just a book.

42:38.523 --> 42:39.823
It's not just a book.

42:40.697 --> 42:42.483
What do you mean
it's not just a book?

42:43.398 --> 42:45.063
No more questions
about the book, okay?

42:45.064 --> 42:46.365
No more questions.

43:12.860 --> 43:15.620
I got a question for you,
since you're here.

43:15.621 --> 43:18.781
Maybe I'll answer it.
Maybe I won't.

43:20.118 --> 43:21.951
Where do you get
your water?

43:22.695 --> 43:24.395
I can't tell you that.

43:24.396 --> 43:26.245
You can't tell me
or you dont know?

43:26.246 --> 43:28.205
Oh, I know.

43:28.206 --> 43:31.743
But if you're not
talking about the book,

43:31.744 --> 43:34.984
I'm not talking
about the water.

43:36.874 --> 43:37.942
You're something else.

43:39.857 --> 43:41.866
Alright, I got another
question for you.

43:41.867 --> 43:43.168
Great.

43:43.169 --> 43:44.191
You hungry?

43:45.844 --> 43:46.958
There's a lot of food there.

43:48.165 --> 43:49.865
More than I can eat.

43:51.093 --> 43:53.802
Tell you what. We
can share it,

43:53.803 --> 43:58.054
like old people used to.

43:59.572 --> 44:02.745
- Okay.
- Okay?

44:07.011 --> 44:10.492
Wait a minute.
Sit.

44:11.961 --> 44:13.388
Sit down.

44:17.877 --> 44:20.441
Give me your hands.

44:21.282 --> 44:23.048
What are you doing?

44:23.049 --> 44:25.311
Trust me, give me
your hands.

44:29.586 --> 44:30.886
Close your eyes.

44:33.064 --> 44:36.046
Dear Lord, we thank
you for this meal.

44:36.047 --> 44:39.988
We thank you for
a warm bed and

44:39.989 --> 44:42.144
roof over our head
on cold nights,

44:42.145 --> 44:43.445
such as this.

44:44.346 --> 44:48.762
- It's been too long.
- Is this from the book?

44:51.036 --> 44:52.458
Close your eyes.

44:54.067 --> 44:58.345
We thank you for the
gift of companionship,

44:58.346 --> 45:01.058
in hard times like these.

45:01.359 --> 45:02.660
Amen.

45:07.357 --> 45:09.080
Now we eat?

45:10.196 --> 45:11.586
Now we eat.

45:42.654 --> 45:43.954
Morning, Solara.

45:46.032 --> 45:48.910
How was your night?
Did you sleep well?

45:48.911 --> 45:51.382
- I did what you said.
- Of course you did.

45:51.383 --> 45:56.639
but I said: Did it work?

45:56.640 --> 46:01.169
- Is he staying?
- We didn't do much talking.

46:01.170 --> 46:03.526
Solara, honey, eat something.

46:07.183 --> 46:09.781
Mom, give me your hand.

46:11.846 --> 46:13.344
Close your eyes.

46:14.069 --> 46:15.937
Mom, trust me.

46:22.369 --> 46:24.142
Dear Lord.

46:25.503 --> 46:28.871
We thank you for our food.

46:28.872 --> 46:33.197
Thank you for my mother.

46:33.198 --> 46:35.082
Thank you for the
roof over our heads.

46:39.346 --> 46:42.413
And...

46:46.152 --> 46:49.542
Well I guess thats
all for now.

46:49.543 --> 46:50.842
Amen.

46:56.855 --> 46:58.976
That's the word
you're looking for.

46:58.977 --> 47:00.277
Amen.

47:02.176 --> 47:04.598
That's how you stop.

47:10.782 --> 47:12.899
You said you
didn't talk much.

47:15.150 --> 47:18.146
But did he do any reading?

47:19.652 --> 47:22.583
- I asked you a question.
- Bill, don't.

47:22.584 --> 47:26.346
You shut your mouth.

47:35.901 --> 47:37.200
Stop!

47:38.170 --> 47:40.615
You're hurting your
mother, Solara.

47:40.616 --> 47:44.335
He said he read
every day. Did he?

47:47.371 --> 47:49.777
Your mother, would
like you to talk.

47:49.778 --> 47:51.078
I dont know!

47:51.906 --> 47:53.207
I dont know.

47:59.179 --> 48:02.721
Yes, okay. Yes,
he was reading.

48:02.722 --> 48:04.420
What kind of book
was he reading?

48:04.421 --> 48:06.689
I don't know, an
old leather one.

48:06.690 --> 48:07.988
And?

48:10.749 --> 48:13.482
I don't know, it had
some thing on the front.

48:13.483 --> 48:14.324
Tell me.

48:14.325 --> 48:15.811
I need you to let her go.

48:15.812 --> 48:17.212
Show me!

48:30.724 --> 48:32.024
Redridge!

48:44.644 --> 48:47.250
Shit! I stayed
up all night.

48:47.251 --> 48:49.643
Where is he?

48:49.644 --> 48:51.845
I dont...

48:56.749 --> 48:58.036
I just want to
make sure...

48:58.037 --> 49:00.018
...there's no
acid in there.

49:00.019 --> 49:02.661
Doesn't matter, just
take these off.

49:02.696 --> 49:04.389
- Take them off.
- Let me dry...

49:04.390 --> 49:05.690
- Hey!
- Alright!

49:07.231 --> 49:10.004
Thank you. You can tell
them I made you do it.

49:11.357 --> 49:13.296
- Say it.
- You made me do it.

49:39.023 --> 49:40.673
Is that thing loaded?

49:40.674 --> 49:42.646
I don't think
it's loaded.

49:42.947 --> 49:44.941
One way to find out.

49:45.242 --> 49:48.989
Look, I need that book.

49:48.990 --> 49:52.848
I mean I want
the book. And you.

49:52.849 --> 49:55.104
If you make me choose,

49:55.105 --> 49:57.709
I'll kill you,
I'll take the book.

49:58.919 --> 50:01.495
Why? Why do you want it?

50:02.965 --> 50:08.095
I grew up with it.
I know its power.

50:08.096 --> 50:11.042
And if you read it,
then so do you.

50:11.043 --> 50:15.355
That's why they burned
them all after the war.

50:17.049 --> 50:18.879
Just staying alive
is an act of faith,

50:18.880 --> 50:20.336
building this town
is an even bigger

50:20.337 --> 50:23.968
act of faith. But they
don't understand that.

50:24.387 --> 50:26.054
None of them do.

50:26.055 --> 50:29.273
And I dont have the
right words to help them,

50:29.274 --> 50:31.475
but the book does.

50:33.549 --> 50:36.480
And I admit...

50:36.481 --> 50:38.734
I've had to do things,
many many things

50:38.735 --> 50:41.691
I hate to build this,
I confess that.

50:43.401 --> 50:46.675
But if we had that book,

50:46.676 --> 50:47.675
I wouldn't have to.

50:49.688 --> 50:54.798
Can you imagine how
different, how righteous

50:54.799 --> 50:56.440
this little world
could be if we had

50:56.441 --> 50:58.448
the right words for our faith.

50:58.449 --> 50:59.817
The people would truly
understand why

50:59.818 --> 51:01.135
they're here and what
they're doing,

51:01.136 --> 51:04.699
they wouldn't need any
other uglier motivations.

51:06.860 --> 51:08.588
It's not right to keep
that book hidden away,

51:08.589 --> 51:11.624
it's meant to be
shared with others.

51:11.625 --> 51:14.708
It's meant to be spread.

51:14.709 --> 51:16.167
Isn't that what you want?

51:16.168 --> 51:19.440
With all my heart and soul.

51:20.350 --> 51:23.281
I always believed that
I'd find a place where

51:23.282 --> 51:28.917
this book belongs,
where it was needed.

51:30.946 --> 51:33.026
I haven't found it yet.

51:38.865 --> 51:41.029
I love this guy.

51:45.609 --> 51:47.560
I love this guy.

51:52.404 --> 51:54.559
Shoot him. Please.

52:15.481 --> 52:18.186
What are you
standing around for?

52:18.659 --> 52:20.190
Take him out, goddamnit!

52:20.301 --> 52:21.523
Take him out!

54:25.558 --> 54:27.933
I don't like being followed.

54:28.778 --> 54:30.428
I wanna come with you.

54:30.429 --> 54:33.564
- No you don't.
- I hate it here.

54:35.403 --> 54:36.277
Then change it.

54:36.278 --> 54:38.595
My mother thinks I'll
be safer with you.

54:44.051 --> 54:47.073
I'll take you to where
we get our water.

54:47.074 --> 54:50.248
You can have all
that you can carry.

54:58.397 --> 55:00.623
I mean all that
we can carry.

55:06.432 --> 55:08.741
Carnegie knows about two
more springs up North.

55:09.800 --> 55:12.440
He says he's gonna
build more towns.

55:13.772 --> 55:15.987
How did he know
about this one?

55:15.988 --> 55:19.619
He's been here.
When he was young.

55:21.041 --> 55:23.595
In the world before.

55:23.596 --> 55:26.818
I guess everyone else
who knew about it died.

55:29.276 --> 55:31.385
We really better hurry.

55:35.041 --> 55:36.041
Shoot.

55:36.042 --> 55:37.686
I think I left my
glasses inside.

55:37.687 --> 55:38.498
Can you take a look for me?

55:38.499 --> 55:39.499
I'll look out here.

55:47.136 --> 55:48.487
What are you doing?

55:51.776 --> 55:54.080
You are such a liar.

55:57.431 --> 55:58.660
I'm not a liar.

55:58.661 --> 55:59.772
You said I could
come with you,

55:59.773 --> 56:01.509
if you got your water.

56:01.510 --> 56:04.359
I didn't say that.
You said that.

56:04.360 --> 56:06.871
Besides, the road's
no place for you.

56:07.336 --> 56:09.428
Much worse than
you think.

56:10.624 --> 56:11.876
Good bye, Solara.

56:11.877 --> 56:13.164
Nice knowing you,
I mean that.

56:13.165 --> 56:16.166
- Hey.
- Yeah?

56:16.167 --> 56:17.467
Fuck you!

56:33.016 --> 56:35.063
Have you washed your
filthy fucking hands?

56:35.064 --> 56:38.595
Twice, Sir.
With your soap.

56:41.692 --> 56:44.343
Put a crew together.
We're going after them.

56:44.344 --> 56:49.545
- For a fucking book.
- It's not a fucking book!

56:49.546 --> 56:51.879
It's a weapon!

56:52.687 --> 56:55.398
A weapon that aims
right at the hearts

56:55.399 --> 56:57.297
and minds of the
weak and desperate.

56:57.298 --> 57:00.838
It will give us
control of them!

57:01.232 --> 57:05.174
If we wanna rule more
than one small fucking town,

57:05.175 --> 57:07.649
we have to have it.

57:07.650 --> 57:09.648
People will come from
all over and do exactly

57:09.649 --> 57:15.535
what I tell them if the
words are from the book.

57:18.279 --> 57:22.822
It's happened before,
and it will happen again.

57:22.823 --> 57:25.704
All we need is that book.

57:39.656 --> 57:41.942
Then I want Solara.

57:46.453 --> 57:49.437
Are you
bargaining with me?

57:50.211 --> 57:52.979
Is this a deal
we're making?

57:54.802 --> 57:57.202
We lost a lot of men.

57:57.203 --> 57:59.747
You need me
more than ever.

58:00.498 --> 58:02.496
When you say that
book's worth the trouble.

58:03.534 --> 58:06.852
Well I believe you.

58:06.853 --> 58:09.663
But I want Solara for it.

58:22.343 --> 58:25.178
Why not?
Why not?

58:26.137 --> 58:28.753
Let's get the
fuck out of here.

59:02.344 --> 59:04.127
Which way are
we heading?

59:05.028 --> 59:06.329
West.

59:45.743 --> 59:47.043
Hello?

59:48.140 --> 59:50.662
Can anyone help me?

59:51.814 --> 59:54.701
Hello, is anybody there?

01:00:03.476 --> 01:00:05.099
Are you okay?

01:00:07.167 --> 01:00:09.420
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

01:00:09.421 --> 01:00:12.299
You go along,
I'll be okay.

01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:14.487
- Let me just...
- No! Really, please!

01:00:14.488 --> 01:00:18.511
I'm fine, really. I need
a man to help me...

01:00:18.512 --> 01:00:21.031
You just go along.

01:00:21.032 --> 01:00:22.632
It's okay, it will just
take a minute.

01:00:22.633 --> 01:00:26.092
I'm fine. Please...

01:00:49.327 --> 01:00:50.649
Help!

01:00:58.016 --> 01:01:00.132
Get off me!

01:03:09.228 --> 01:03:11.126
Hold them there.

01:03:18.908 --> 01:03:23.218
- What's wrong?
- Did you hear that?

01:03:31.823 --> 01:03:33.075
Don't move.

01:03:49.229 --> 01:03:52.955
Take the wire off
of that. Spool it up.

01:03:53.975 --> 01:03:56.149
- What is that?
- Dinner.

01:04:15.615 --> 01:04:18.583
It's like he's
protected somehow.

01:04:19.315 --> 01:04:20.683
Like there's nothing
that can touch him.

01:04:23.857 --> 01:04:26.173
He's just a fucking man.

01:04:27.922 --> 01:04:28.710
You put a bullet in him

01:04:28.771 --> 01:04:30.252
he'll go down
like any other man.

01:04:36.509 --> 01:04:37.881
Still warm.

01:04:41.342 --> 01:04:43.789
No more than a
few hours dead.

01:04:47.511 --> 01:04:49.284
He can't be far.

01:04:56.315 --> 01:04:59.042
Son of a bitch.

01:05:01.462 --> 01:05:03.420
Solara.

01:05:04.141 --> 01:05:06.722
You sure you
still want her?

01:05:11.127 --> 01:05:12.551
It's gonna be
dark soon.

01:05:12.552 --> 01:05:13.366
We can't track
them at night,

01:05:13.367 --> 01:05:14.667
they'll see us coming.

01:05:15.981 --> 01:05:19.973
We'll drive right past
them and never know it.

01:05:19.974 --> 01:05:20.974
He's right.

01:05:21.436 --> 01:05:25.796
They're on foot. Tired.
They'll have to sleep.

01:05:27.484 --> 01:05:29.536
We'll make up the
ground tomorrow.

01:05:29.537 --> 01:05:31.681
We'll have them
before morning, Sam.

01:05:33.171 --> 01:05:36.328
That better be
a guarantee.

01:05:52.694 --> 01:05:55.556
Do you really read the
same book every day?

01:05:55.557 --> 01:05:56.857
Without fail.

01:06:01.023 --> 01:06:03.159
Will you read some to me?

01:06:05.758 --> 01:06:07.058
Please.

01:06:12.368 --> 01:06:19.338
The Lord is my shepard.
I shall not want;

01:06:19.339 --> 01:06:24.659
He makes me to lie down
in green pastures.

01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:27.948
He leads me beside
still waters;

01:06:27.949 --> 01:06:31.721
He restores my soul.

01:06:31.722 --> 01:06:34.828
He leadeth me in paths
of righteousness

01:06:34.829 --> 01:06:36.129
for His name's sake.

01:06:40.185 --> 01:06:41.434
Yea, though I walk
through the valley

01:06:41.435 --> 01:06:44.006
of the shadow
of death,

01:06:44.007 --> 01:06:47.034
I will fear no evil;

01:06:47.035 --> 01:06:48.035
for Thou art with me

01:06:49.602 --> 01:06:52.616
- That's beautiful.
- You like that?

01:06:52.617 --> 01:06:55.864
- Did you write that?
- Yes I did.

01:06:55.865 --> 01:06:59.251
- Really?
- No.

01:07:00.804 --> 01:07:02.659
That was around
a long time before

01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:05.291
you and I got here,
thats for sure.

01:07:10.797 --> 01:07:12.357
What did you mean
when you said it's

01:07:12.358 --> 01:07:13.658
not just any book?

01:07:24.411 --> 01:07:25.711
It's the only one.

01:07:28.425 --> 01:07:29.925
Really?

01:07:29.926 --> 01:07:31.768
After the war people
made it their business

01:07:31.769 --> 01:07:36.055
to find and destroy any
that the fires didn't get already,

01:07:36.056 --> 01:07:37.142
some people say this
was the reason

01:07:37.143 --> 01:07:38.694
for the war in the first place.

01:07:41.218 --> 01:07:45.616
Anyway, it's the only
one that survived.

01:07:47.874 --> 01:07:49.848
How did you get it?

01:07:54.975 --> 01:07:59.566
They said that the war,
tore a hole in the sky.

01:07:59.567 --> 01:08:01.150
You probably
heard the stories.

01:08:01.151 --> 01:08:02.151
Yeah.

01:08:02.834 --> 01:08:07.131
Tore a hole in the sky,
sun came down,

01:08:07.132 --> 01:08:08.631
and burned everything.

01:08:09.197 --> 01:08:11.518
Everything and
everybody.

01:08:11.919 --> 01:08:14.026
You were lucky, to
hole up and hide in

01:08:14.027 --> 01:08:17.075
a place like this,
or underground.

01:08:19.002 --> 01:08:21.022
Most people weren't lucky.

01:08:24.413 --> 01:08:26.966
So, a year later we
started coming out.

01:08:27.929 --> 01:08:28.929
People wandering around.

01:08:30.644 --> 01:08:31.794
Not knowing what
I was going to do.

01:08:32.071 --> 01:08:36.004
Trying to find a place to survive.

01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:41.536
One day, I heard a voice.
It's hard to explain,

01:08:41.537 --> 01:08:47.341
but it was like if it was
coming from inside of me.

01:08:47.343 --> 01:08:49.451
But I could hear it as
clear as I can hear you

01:08:49.499 --> 01:08:50.452
talking to me now.

01:08:52.161 --> 01:08:54.551
What did this voice say?

01:08:54.553 --> 01:08:59.948
It led me ... to a place
where I found the book ...

01:08:59.950 --> 01:09:03.042
buried, under some rubble.

01:09:05.979 --> 01:09:11.096
The voice told me to
carry the book out West.

01:09:11.098 --> 01:09:14.817
It told me a path had
been laid out for me,

01:09:14.818 --> 01:09:18.620
that I'd be led to a
place where the book

01:09:18.621 --> 01:09:19.921
would be safe.

01:09:23.287 --> 01:09:26.716
Told me that I'd
be protected,

01:09:26.716 --> 01:09:30.180
against any one or anything
that stood in my path.

01:09:33.158 --> 01:09:35.884
I've been walking ever since.

01:09:37.354 --> 01:09:38.497
And you did all that
because a voice

01:09:38.499 --> 01:09:40.631
in your head told
you to.

01:09:41.444 --> 01:09:43.045
Yes, I did.

01:09:43.615 --> 01:09:44.698
I know what I heard.

01:09:46.005 --> 01:09:47.060
I know what I hear.

01:09:48.322 --> 01:09:49.506
I know I'm not crazy.

01:09:50.212 --> 01:09:53.019
And I know I would
have never made it,

01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:54.917
without help.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:58.367
- What's that?
- One question too many.

01:09:58.368 --> 01:10:00.888
Go to bed, we've got an
early start in the morning.

01:11:03.778 --> 01:11:05.709
What are you doing?

01:11:05.710 --> 01:11:07.183
I'm sorry, I thought
you were sleeping.

01:11:07.184 --> 01:11:10.845
I wasn't sleeping.
What are you doing?

01:11:10.846 --> 01:11:12.374
I just wanted to
see the book.

01:11:12.375 --> 01:11:15.977
Nobody touches it but
me, you understand me?

01:11:15.978 --> 01:11:18.356
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, I understand.

01:11:19.109 --> 01:11:19.931
Go to sleep.

01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:31.581
You said you don't know
how to read anyway.

01:11:31.582 --> 01:11:33.278
It's of no use to you.

01:11:33.279 --> 01:11:34.578
Yeah.

01:11:35.559 --> 01:11:37.586
So teach me.

01:11:57.218 --> 01:11:59.528
Hold on. Hold up.
Stop!

01:12:05.497 --> 01:12:07.233
You say you've been
walking for 30 years, right?

01:12:07.434 --> 01:12:08.434
Right.

01:12:09.223 --> 01:12:11.000
Have you ever thought
maybe you were lost?

01:12:11.001 --> 01:12:12.300
No.

01:12:12.301 --> 01:12:14.577
How do you know you're
walking in the right direction?

01:12:14.578 --> 01:12:17.195
I walk by faith,
not by sight.

01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:20.779
- What does that mean?
- It means you know something,

01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:23.116
even if you don't
know something.

01:12:23.117 --> 01:12:24.245
It doesn't make
any sense.

01:12:24.246 --> 01:12:27.033
It doesn't have to
make sense. It's faith.

01:12:27.034 --> 01:12:29.618
Its a flower of light,
in a field of darkness,

01:12:29.619 --> 01:12:31.821
giving me the strength
to carry on, understand?

01:12:31.822 --> 01:12:33.317
Is that from
your book?

01:12:33.318 --> 01:12:37.919
No, it's Johnny Cash.
'Live from Folsom Prison'.

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.221
What?

01:13:01.603 --> 01:13:03.844
Do you think anyone
lives there?

01:13:03.845 --> 01:13:05.145
I dont know.

01:13:06.574 --> 01:13:08.439
Maybe there's water.

01:13:18.286 --> 01:13:19.845
Stay behind me.

01:13:24.988 --> 01:13:26.975
This is weird.

01:14:01.704 --> 01:14:02.899
Who are you?

01:14:06.981 --> 01:14:09.728
Travelers, thats all.
Don't mean any harm.

01:14:09.729 --> 01:14:13.044
No trespassing. Didn't
you read the sign?

01:14:13.045 --> 01:14:15.494
We're very sorry,
I didn't see it.

01:14:16.338 --> 01:14:17.846
- What's your business?
- We were just...

01:14:17.847 --> 01:14:19.907
No business.

01:14:19.908 --> 01:14:22.041
We're very sorry,
and if you let us,

01:14:22.042 --> 01:14:23.912
we'll be on our way.

01:14:23.913 --> 01:14:25.821
George, look at them.

01:14:25.822 --> 01:14:28.089
One of them is
just a girl.

01:14:28.090 --> 01:14:31.386
Old story. Heard it a
hundred times before.

01:14:31.387 --> 01:14:33.338
We get so few
visitors these days,

01:14:33.339 --> 01:14:35.997
George is suspicious
of everybody.

01:14:35.998 --> 01:14:37.832
I'm Martha.

01:14:37.833 --> 01:14:40.178
Would you care
for some tea?

01:14:50.448 --> 01:14:54.099
How about some music?
It's so soothing.

01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:55.401
George!

01:15:08.245 --> 01:15:15.238
<i>You can ring my bell,
ring my bell.</i>

01:15:15.239 --> 01:15:16.538
How do you like it?

01:15:23.114 --> 01:15:29.367
<i>You can ring my bell,
ring my bell.</i>

01:15:29.368 --> 01:15:32.134
- Is that good?
- Good, good.

01:15:32.735 --> 01:15:34.035
Great.

01:15:38.274 --> 01:15:40.222
It's amazing that you
two have survived

01:15:40.223 --> 01:15:41.995
out here all by
yourselves.

01:15:41.996 --> 01:15:45.775
Well, now. George is
something of a handyman.

01:15:47.579 --> 01:15:49.153
He did a lot of
work on this place,

01:15:49.154 --> 01:15:50.853
making it safe.

01:15:50.854 --> 01:15:53.636
We may be old, but
we're resilliant.

01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:55.778
We've had more
than a few try to take

01:15:55.799 --> 01:15:56.518
this place from us.

01:15:57.107 --> 01:15:58.050
Haven't we George?

01:15:58.317 --> 01:16:00.043
Yes we have.

01:16:00.316 --> 01:16:02.189
I wanna show you
something, come on.

01:16:02.190 --> 01:16:05.102
George, no. Not now.

01:16:05.443 --> 01:16:06.703
Come on!

01:16:09.512 --> 01:16:12.034
- Are these...?
- Graves? Sure.

01:16:12.035 --> 01:16:14.265
It'd be uncivilized
not to bury them.

01:16:14.266 --> 01:16:17.437
Besides, it's good
for the soil.

01:16:17.438 --> 01:16:19.082
Come on back inside.

01:16:19.083 --> 01:16:21.321
I might be able to rustle
you up some sandwhiches.

01:16:21.322 --> 01:16:23.478
Well, thank you. Thank
you very much.

01:16:23.479 --> 01:16:25.364
- We gotta go now.
- They killed all these people.

01:16:25.365 --> 01:16:26.775
They didn't just kill
them. They ate them.

01:16:26.776 --> 01:16:28.722
- Their hands are shaking.
- Too much human meat.

01:16:28.723 --> 01:16:30.023
Let's go.

01:16:30.024 --> 01:16:33.225
I found some meat.
I hope you're hungry.

01:16:33.226 --> 01:16:34.754
No. No, thank you.

01:16:34.755 --> 01:16:38.541
- Well, we gotta be going.
- So soon?

01:16:38.542 --> 01:16:40.039
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:41.419
Are you sure you
won't stay?

01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:44.608
I'm sure. Very sure.
Put the gun down.

01:16:44.609 --> 01:16:47.512
Sorry. Take this. Open
the door for us, please.

01:16:48.079 --> 01:16:50.621
- Thank you for the tea.
- Thank you so much.

01:16:57.946 --> 01:16:59.357
Go back inside.

01:17:03.556 --> 01:17:04.528
George, what's wrong?

01:17:04.529 --> 01:17:07.010
A whole company of armed
degenerats, thats what's wrong,

01:17:07.011 --> 01:17:09.430
and they led them
straight to us.

01:17:09.431 --> 01:17:10.978
I just set out the
good china.

01:17:10.979 --> 01:17:12.104
Fuck the china.

01:17:12.105 --> 01:17:13.592
Have you got any
more weapons?

01:17:13.593 --> 01:17:16.914
Weapons? I'll show
you some weapons.

01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:25.125
Come on.

01:17:25.126 --> 01:17:27.471
We know you're
in there.

01:17:28.566 --> 01:17:31.974
Come on out and nobody
needs to get hurt.

01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:38.106
I'll make it easy.

01:17:38.107 --> 01:17:41.092
Send out Solara
with the book.

01:17:41.093 --> 01:17:42.014
What are we gonna do?

01:17:42.015 --> 01:17:43.812
I know what the
fuck I'm doing.

01:17:43.813 --> 01:17:45.403
Wait, wait.
-- That's all I want

01:17:45.404 --> 01:17:46.404
is the book!

01:17:47.351 --> 01:17:48.170
And the girl.

01:17:50.438 --> 01:17:52.608
They ain't coming out.

01:18:18.331 --> 01:18:21.564
Shit! Get down!
Everybody down!

01:18:40.183 --> 01:18:43.095
Hey! You know that
voice you heard?

01:18:43.096 --> 01:18:44.745
Did he say anything
about this?

01:18:45.094 --> 01:18:47.458
We'll get out alive.
Both of us.

01:18:47.459 --> 01:18:48.813
What about us?

01:18:49.893 --> 01:18:51.416
Didn't mention you.

01:19:00.777 --> 01:19:02.077
Cease fire!

01:19:02.899 --> 01:19:04.198
Cease fire.

01:19:16.419 --> 01:19:18.459
Motherfuckers!

01:19:24.105 --> 01:19:27.601
<i>Over on the side!
Over on the side!</i>

01:19:30.437 --> 01:19:32.049
Fucking bastards!

01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:38.445
Hold your fire!

01:19:39.085 --> 01:19:41.723
- What are they doing?
- Nothing good.

01:20:56.222 --> 01:20:57.718
Where is the book?

01:21:04.594 --> 01:21:06.270
Check his pack.

01:21:24.755 --> 01:21:26.057
It ain't here.

01:21:28.994 --> 01:21:32.117
This is your last chance.
You give it up, or

01:21:32.118 --> 01:21:34.527
I swear I'll bury
you out here.

01:21:44.883 --> 01:21:48.888
Son-of-a...
Let's try this again.

01:21:53.218 --> 01:21:55.379
- Carnegie!
- What!?

01:22:05.232 --> 01:22:09.685
Now. Where's the book?

01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:16.416
Give him the book.
Please.

01:22:20.808 --> 01:22:22.737
Don't tell him.

01:22:32.296 --> 01:22:35.437
It's in the house.
Back of the TV.

01:22:36.770 --> 01:22:40.335
- Go check the TV.
- The what?

01:22:40.498 --> 01:22:41.734
You're fucking shitting me.

01:22:41.795 --> 01:22:42.735
You go!

01:22:43.595 --> 01:22:45.095
Go!

01:23:20.807 --> 01:23:24.625
Ask and you
shall receive.

01:23:29.424 --> 01:23:31.810
God is good,
is he not?

01:23:33.016 --> 01:23:34.316
All the time.

01:23:36.666 --> 01:23:38.485
Not all the time.

01:24:05.712 --> 01:24:07.012
No!

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:52.741
You see?

01:24:55.334 --> 01:24:56.656
What did I tell you?

01:25:03.622 --> 01:25:05.567
He's just a man.

01:25:08.782 --> 01:25:12.056
No! Leave him alone!

01:25:20.152 --> 01:25:22.606
Where's your protection now?

01:25:23.926 --> 01:25:25.326
Hmm?

01:25:37.438 --> 01:25:39.238
Pray for me.

01:25:42.466 --> 01:25:43.767
Okay?

01:25:48.211 --> 01:25:49.811
I mean it.

01:27:16.662 --> 01:27:17.962
Shit.

01:27:19.448 --> 01:27:20.748
Go back!

01:28:04.466 --> 01:28:06.921
Come on.
Come on!

01:29:05.583 --> 01:29:07.668
We've barely got enough
fuel to make it back.

01:29:07.709 --> 01:29:09.485
Do you want to
go after her?

01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:12.860
No.

01:30:33.722 --> 01:30:37.320
- Where are you going?
- I'm going West.

01:30:37.321 --> 01:30:38.121
Gotta go West.

01:30:40.958 --> 01:30:42.258
Hey.

01:31:07.471 --> 01:31:11.339
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

01:31:11.340 --> 01:31:13.086
This. This is
all my fault.

01:31:13.087 --> 01:31:14.560
- No, it's not.
- Yeah it is,

01:31:14.561 --> 01:31:15.603
if I didn't come with
you, none of this

01:31:15.604 --> 01:31:16.904
would have happened.

01:31:18.704 --> 01:31:21.347
It's not your fault.

01:31:23.205 --> 01:31:25.053
Did what I had to do.

01:31:25.054 --> 01:31:26.754
Didn't think anything
could make you

01:31:26.755 --> 01:31:27.455
give up that book.

01:31:33.549 --> 01:31:35.321
You know, for years
I've been carrying and

01:31:35.322 --> 01:31:37.207
reading it every day.

01:31:39.728 --> 01:31:42.712
I got so caught up
with keeping it safe

01:31:42.713 --> 01:31:47.591
I forgot to live by
what I learned from it.

01:31:48.095 --> 01:31:50.006
Yeah? What's that?

01:31:51.082 --> 01:31:52.921
Just to...

01:31:55.334 --> 01:31:58.453
Do for others more than
you do for yourself.

01:32:00.842 --> 01:32:03.335
It's what I got
from it anyway.

01:32:50.090 --> 01:32:51.568
Do you smell that?

01:32:52.673 --> 01:32:56.091
- What?
- In the air. Salt.

01:33:00.632 --> 01:33:03.215
We're getting close
to the ocean.

01:34:01.574 --> 01:34:02.420
That's it.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:05.771
That's it.

01:34:39.453 --> 01:34:40.801
Get the Engineer!

01:36:13.008 --> 01:36:14.085
That's far enough!

01:36:16.173 --> 01:36:17.749
What's your
business here?

01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:21.892
My name is Eli.

01:36:22.091 --> 01:36:24.946
I have a King James
Bible in my possession.

01:36:25.215 --> 01:36:27.274
Remain where you are.
Don't attempt to make

01:36:27.411 --> 01:36:31.471
any sudden moves, or
you will be fired upon.

01:36:47.610 --> 01:36:51.119
Be careful with it.
Thank you.

01:36:57.732 --> 01:36:59.709
Careful with it.

01:37:09.448 --> 01:37:10.771
Wait.

01:37:12.166 --> 01:37:15.166
We've been doing this
for a long time now.

01:37:17.137 --> 01:37:18.139
Feels like a museum.

01:37:18.199 --> 01:37:20.476
Oh no.
It's much more than that.

01:37:21.004 --> 01:37:24.299
This is where we're
going to start again.

01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:26.062
We've got a printing
press that will be

01:37:26.112 --> 01:37:27.840
operational quite soon.

01:37:28.293 --> 01:37:29.616
We're going to teach
people about the

01:37:29.656 --> 01:37:30.651
world they lost.

01:37:31.885 --> 01:37:33.438
Help them start
to rebuild it.

01:37:34.155 --> 01:37:36.690
And look, Shakespeare,
Britannica.

01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:38.659
Missing only a
few volumes.

01:37:38.850 --> 01:37:40.792
There's a whole series
of beautiful Mozart

01:37:40.963 --> 01:37:45.238
and Wagner records. Still
in very pristine condition.

01:37:45.239 --> 01:37:48.897
But never a Bible.
Well, not until now.

01:37:48.898 --> 01:37:51.563
May I ask what
condition it's in?

01:37:53.268 --> 01:37:56.941
It's beat up. But it
will do the job.

01:37:58.441 --> 01:37:59.656
Do you think
I could see it?

01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:01.546
Yes, you may.

01:38:09.258 --> 01:38:11.213
- That's it. It's open.
- Good.

01:38:46.253 --> 01:38:47.606
Do you have anything
to write on?

01:38:47.607 --> 01:38:51.254
Could you get us some
writing paper, please?

01:38:51.255 --> 01:38:52.556
A lot of it.

01:38:54.389 --> 01:38:56.091
A whole lot of it.

01:38:56.436 --> 01:38:57.735
It can't be.

01:39:05.541 --> 01:39:07.492
It's impossible!

01:39:08.801 --> 01:39:10.416
It can't be!

01:39:13.278 --> 01:39:15.386
Pay close attention.

01:39:15.387 --> 01:39:20.824
And write down
everything I say.

01:39:21.676 --> 01:39:25.437
Exactly as I say it.

01:39:29.491 --> 01:39:35.997
The first book of Moses.
Called Genesis.

01:39:36.664 --> 01:39:40.556
Chapter one,
verse one:

01:39:43.759 --> 01:39:50.892
"In the beginning God
created the heavens

01:39:50.893 --> 01:39:52.294
and the earth. "

01:39:56.542 --> 01:39:58.288
Verse two:

01:40:00.161 --> 01:40:08.882
"And the earth was
without form and void;

01:40:13.355 --> 01:40:20.912
and darkness was upon
the face of the deep.

01:40:23.637 --> 01:40:32.137
And the Spirit of God
was hovering

01:40:32.138 --> 01:40:35.240
over the face
of the waters. "

01:40:38.290 --> 01:40:40.863
Verse three:

01:40:43.346 --> 01:40:56.154
"And God said, Let
there be light:

01:40:56.155 --> 01:40:58.319
and there was light. "

01:41:08.746 --> 01:41:11.073
Where is Solara?

01:41:14.187 --> 01:41:18.531
Out there. Her choice.

01:41:19.161 --> 01:41:24.072
I tried to bring her
back. She refused.

01:41:27.224 --> 01:41:30.008
What did you do
when she refused?

01:41:35.818 --> 01:41:36.696
Read it.

01:41:36.697 --> 01:41:37.955
What did you do
to my daughter?

01:41:37.956 --> 01:41:38.902
Read it!

01:41:38.903 --> 01:41:42.033
What did you do
to my daughter!?

01:42:00.224 --> 01:42:02.154
You can start anytime.

01:42:10.052 --> 01:42:11.353
Sorry.

01:42:13.975 --> 01:42:17.103
It's been so long
I dont remember.

01:42:24.213 --> 01:42:27.654
- You have to.
- I have to? Really?

01:42:27.655 --> 01:42:30.116
You have to. Please.

01:42:33.295 --> 01:42:38.869
- Your leg.
- It doesn't hurt anymore.

01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:41.567
I can smell it.

01:42:56.179 --> 01:42:59.151
You worked so hard
for that book.

01:42:59.152 --> 01:43:03.868
You sacrificed so
much, so many men.

01:43:05.131 --> 01:43:07.263
More than you
could spare.

01:43:09.117 --> 01:43:11.243
Now, all those people
who were too scared

01:43:11.244 --> 01:43:14.172
to even say your name.
They're downstairs,

01:43:14.173 --> 01:43:17.445
tearing up the bar right
now, did you know that?

01:43:18.024 --> 01:43:21.149
And there's no one
there to stop them.

01:43:22.094 --> 01:43:24.736
And you are feverish.

01:43:26.874 --> 01:43:28.451
I can't imagine what
it must feel like to

01:43:28.452 --> 01:43:30.390
have what you want
so close and it might

01:43:30.391 --> 01:43:32.637
as well be a 
million miles away.

01:43:32.638 --> 01:43:33.941
Stop it!

01:43:37.375 --> 01:43:44.285
Are you leaving me?
Claudia?

01:43:45.552 --> 01:43:47.538
Claudia!?

01:43:50.477 --> 01:43:52.474
Claudia!

01:45:40.666 --> 01:45:44.492
Dear Lord. Thank you for
giving me the strength

01:45:44.493 --> 01:45:46.281
and the conviction to
complete the task you

01:45:46.282 --> 01:45:47.809
entrusted to me.

01:46:12.738 --> 01:46:15.853
Thank you for guiding
me straight and true,

01:46:15.854 --> 01:46:18.797
through the many
obstacles on my path.

01:46:24.420 --> 01:46:26.442
And for keeping me
resolute when all around

01:46:26.443 --> 01:46:28.552
seemed lost.

01:46:28.904 --> 01:46:30.571
Thank you for your
protection and for your

01:46:30.572 --> 01:46:33.373
many signs along
the way.

01:46:34.666 --> 01:46:37.384
Thank you for any good
that I may have done,

01:46:37.385 --> 01:46:40.628
I'm so sorry
about the bad.

01:46:41.266 --> 01:46:42.525
You don't have to
leave, you know.

01:46:42.526 --> 01:46:44.744
You're very welcome
to stay here.

01:46:44.745 --> 01:46:47.018
You'll be perfectly safe.

01:46:47.019 --> 01:46:48.939
Thank you.

01:46:48.940 --> 01:46:51.865
But this is something
that I have to do.

01:46:56.431 --> 01:46:58.311
Where will you go?

01:46:59.412 --> 01:47:00.714
Home.

01:47:06.743 --> 01:47:09.009
Thank you for the
friend I made.

01:47:09.010 --> 01:47:13.205
Please watch over her,
as you watched over me.

01:47:33.574 --> 01:47:37.289
Thank you for finally
allowing me to rest.

01:47:37.290 --> 01:47:39.424
I'm so very tired.

01:47:39.773 --> 01:47:43.772
But I go now to my
rest at peace.

01:47:43.773 --> 01:47:45.689
Knowing that I've done
right with my time
