WEBVTT

00:09.720 --> 00:12.240
[breathing heavily]

00:16.120 --> 00:17.840
[both grunting]

00:20.640 --> 00:21.480
Come on!

00:23.560 --> 00:25.200
[indistinct chatter and laughter]

00:35.120 --> 00:38.160
[reporter] Were you two aware
that you had a live bomb in your hands?

00:38.240 --> 00:39.360
Actually, no.

00:39.440 --> 00:42.240
We thought it was just another challenge
our headmaster Louis thought up.

00:42.320 --> 00:44.920
Yeah. I was actually trying
to grab it from him.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.240
That's why we were both carrying it
before it blew up.

00:47.320 --> 00:48.440
And you, Miss Woods,

00:48.520 --> 00:50.760
what was the first thing your mother
said to you when she woke up?

00:50.840 --> 00:52.120
Uh, you know, the usual.

00:52.200 --> 00:54.840
"What have you done to your hair?"
"You're wearing too much makeup."

00:56.320 --> 01:00.440
Uh, actually, she said that she loved me,
and I told her the same.

01:11.520 --> 01:15.200
Alex, you know you're gonna have
to kiss me in front of my dad eventually.

01:15.280 --> 01:17.600
Yeah, I don't think so.

01:17.680 --> 01:19.600
I like Brooke's choice in men.

01:20.880 --> 01:22.440
Stay scared, son.

01:22.520 --> 01:24.280
-Stay very scared.
-[Brooke chuckles softly]

01:25.880 --> 01:28.080
Mr. Osmond,
what's next for the Greenhouse?

01:28.160 --> 01:31.600
-How do you follow something like this?
-We get back to normal.

01:32.560 --> 01:33.800
The Science Olympiad is coming up.

01:33.880 --> 01:36.640
A team from the Greenhouse
has placed first for six straight years.

01:37.400 --> 01:39.440
I expect nothing less
from my champions again this year.

01:40.040 --> 01:42.760
Jackie, I know you wanna be
with your family, but why can't we...

01:43.960 --> 01:47.800
Actually, I read that there are, like,
3.5 million long-distance relationships

01:47.880 --> 01:49.280
in the United States, and...

01:51.320 --> 01:52.880
But I don't wanna say goodbye.

01:55.280 --> 01:56.120
Goodbye, Jackie.

02:01.720 --> 02:02.600
Hi, Emma.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.920
[crowd cheering and applauding]

02:17.400 --> 02:18.760
Whoo!

02:42.440 --> 02:44.080
-[chuckles]
-[Daniel] <i>I don't know, babe.</i>

02:44.160 --> 02:46.000
<i>I think you'd be pretty great on the team.</i>

02:47.840 --> 02:49.560
Hey, Woods. We really need you over here.

02:49.640 --> 02:51.200
-[Daniel sighs]<i> Damn.</i>
-[sighs]

02:51.280 --> 02:54.120
I wish we could study together.
I miss you, babe.

02:54.200 --> 02:56.440
I know. I miss you, too.

02:56.520 --> 02:57.720
Are you coming?

02:58.520 --> 02:59.800
About to start geology and geography.

03:00.440 --> 03:02.120
Yay, we're studying rocks.

03:02.920 --> 03:06.960
[yawns] What did you just say?
I just fell asleep. [chuckles]

03:08.120 --> 03:08.960
You know...

03:09.760 --> 03:11.840
there's no reason
why we can't study together.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.000
What do you mean?

03:16.840 --> 03:17.680
Welcome.

03:18.360 --> 03:21.400
-Hey, guys.
-We brought reinforcements.

03:22.560 --> 03:26.040
-Uh, what's going on, Woods?
-I invited everyone over.

03:26.120 --> 03:27.680
Thought we could all study together.

03:27.760 --> 03:31.840
Wow. It is nerd kingdom in here.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.440
-[Sophie chuckles] Right?
-[Daniel scoffs] Right.

03:33.520 --> 03:36.280
Hey, when was the last time
we were in their clubhouse?

03:36.360 --> 03:38.000
Probably the night
you guys trashed the place.

03:38.080 --> 03:39.280
[all exclaim softly]

03:39.360 --> 03:42.240
But... but now we're just a bunch of kids

03:42.320 --> 03:44.680
that have to study
for some silly Olympiad, right?

03:44.760 --> 03:47.960
-Yeah. Yep.
-Okay, let's get to it.

03:48.040 --> 03:49.000
Let's go.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.160
[Louis] What do you mean,
they studied together?

03:55.240 --> 03:57.120
[Suzanne] The Ravens
invited the Eagles over.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.840
[Louis] Well, that obviously
wasn't a great strategy.

03:58.920 --> 04:01.840
I didn't even know they had a ribbon
for tenth place.

04:01.920 --> 04:03.320
Unfortunately, they do.

04:03.400 --> 04:04.560
This is a disgrace.

04:04.640 --> 04:06.960
-I don't know what happened, Louis.
-I do.

04:07.040 --> 04:11.680
I created the two houses at Greenhouse
to encourage community and competition.

04:11.760 --> 04:14.840
But after what's happened,
they've unified, they're friendly.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.840
Their fire to be the best is gone.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.480
Well, what are we gonna do about it?

04:22.120 --> 04:24.000
I want you to all turn in your Louies.

04:24.079 --> 04:25.560
-What?
-Why?

04:25.640 --> 04:27.560
[Louis] This is a navigation
and teamwork challenge.

04:27.640 --> 04:29.520
You're all gonna be hiking
in the Santa Barbara mountains

04:29.600 --> 04:30.720
for the next two days.

04:30.800 --> 04:32.720
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Brooke] Two days?

04:32.800 --> 04:35.880
Three flags for each house
have been hidden along the trail.

04:35.960 --> 04:37.800
The first house
to find all three flags wins.

04:38.520 --> 04:41.400
The house that loses has to clean
and clear the entire Greenhouse grounds

04:41.480 --> 04:44.280
since we haven't had a groundskeeper
for the last month,

04:44.360 --> 04:46.680
while the winning team gets to enjoy
a day at the beach.

04:46.760 --> 04:49.240
-Wait, wait, so what is this?
-That's called a map.

04:49.320 --> 04:52.880
That's what people used to find their way
before smartphones and Louies.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.680
Captains, please.

04:57.960 --> 05:01.120
These walkie-talkies
are for emergency purposes only.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.760
Once it's used,
the house forfeits and loses.

05:05.440 --> 05:06.640
Everybody, do what you have to do.

05:06.720 --> 05:09.680
Get ready and pack your bags.
Bus leaves in ten minutes.

05:09.760 --> 05:11.520
-[all] Ten minutes?
-[Alex] What?

05:12.880 --> 05:13.760
[eagle screeches]

05:25.680 --> 05:28.200
It's this way. You're looking at it wrong.

05:28.280 --> 05:31.480
I got a 1590 on my SATs.
I think I can read a map.

05:32.640 --> 05:35.320
Look, my dad would take us camping
for three weeks every summer

05:35.400 --> 05:36.920
with only a compass to find our way.

05:37.440 --> 05:38.720
But, hey, it's your call.

05:42.600 --> 05:43.440
Fine.

05:44.360 --> 05:45.480
We're going this way.

05:47.560 --> 05:49.280
I can't feel my legs. [sighs]

05:50.600 --> 05:51.640
[Alex] I can't breathe.

05:52.320 --> 05:54.920
[sighs] Come on, you guys.
We have to keep going.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.320
I know we're close to our first flag.
I can feel it.

05:57.400 --> 06:00.120
Can we just rest for a second?
I'm exhausted.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.360
Says the girl whose dad put us here.

06:02.440 --> 06:05.560
Hey. Don't blame the spawn of Satan,
blame Satan.

06:05.640 --> 06:06.720
[scoffs and chuckles]

06:06.800 --> 06:08.480
Did you just call my dad Satan?

06:09.800 --> 06:11.880
[scoffs] No. No.

06:13.400 --> 06:14.480
Maybe.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.600
My beautiful spawn.

06:18.320 --> 06:20.840
Okay, guys, we can stop,
but just for five minutes.

06:20.920 --> 06:23.600
Let's make some quick sandwiches
and get our energy up. [sighs]

06:23.680 --> 06:24.840
-Good idea.
-All right.

06:24.920 --> 06:27.640
[Emma] So, how are things with Jackie?

06:27.720 --> 06:30.240
It's crazy her mom found her
after all this time.

06:30.840 --> 06:32.680
Thank goodness for national news, huh?

06:32.760 --> 06:34.680
Yeah, thank goodness.

06:37.800 --> 06:41.240
-So, how's she doing?
-Great! Awesome.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.960
We're great. So great. [sighs]

06:45.560 --> 06:49.920
Oh. Great, that's...
I'm glad to hear that.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.480
I don't know why people say
long-distance is so difficult.

06:52.560 --> 06:55.000
[stammers] I think it makes
our relationship better.

06:56.200 --> 07:00.080
If you see your partner every day,
it could get boring, you know?

07:01.280 --> 07:02.560
I guess so.

07:04.840 --> 07:07.600
Actually,
I'm in a long-distance relationship, too.

07:07.680 --> 07:12.200
-Wow. Really?
-Yeah, you don't know him. Obviously.

07:13.560 --> 07:14.560
Wow, cool.

07:15.320 --> 07:16.160
Yeah.

07:16.680 --> 07:17.600
What's his name?

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Oh...

07:21.680 --> 07:22.520
Leaf.

07:24.200 --> 07:25.200
Leaf?

07:26.520 --> 07:28.080
Yeah, his parents were hippies.

07:29.840 --> 07:33.080
Found it! I found the first flag.

07:33.160 --> 07:34.880
Way to go, Becca.

07:34.960 --> 07:36.600
Good thing we went this way.

07:36.680 --> 07:39.920
[Becca] Hey, how about we move the rock
to point the other way

07:40.000 --> 07:41.440
to throw off the Eagles?

07:41.520 --> 07:43.280
You mean, like, cheating?

07:43.360 --> 07:46.840
Well, it's not really cheating,
it's just... throwing them off a little.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.040
It's dirty.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.040
Come on, guys.
Let's win this the right way.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.440
-Hayley's right.
-Yep.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.560
[clicks tongue] Of course.
I was just kidding.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.440
Let's go, uh, find the next flag, guys.

07:59.480 --> 08:02.520
My dad isn't Satan.
We deserve this. You know that.

08:03.280 --> 08:05.000
I know, I was just teasing.

08:06.440 --> 08:08.840
Hey, you... You got a little something...

08:09.680 --> 08:11.200
-Where?
-Yeah, right there.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.040
-[Brooke exclaims] Alex!
-Oh. [chuckling]

08:15.440 --> 08:16.680
-Ah!
-[Sophie] You guys, gross.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.640
Let's just eat our sandwiches and go.

08:18.720 --> 08:20.520
Seriously, guys, grow up.

08:21.480 --> 08:23.000
-Soph, can you help me up?
-Mmm, sure.

08:25.240 --> 08:26.520
Ooh.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.120
-Oh!
-[all laughing]

08:28.960 --> 08:32.040
-You are a dead man!
-[laughing] No, no!

08:32.720 --> 08:34.120
[laughs and exclaims]

08:35.800 --> 08:38.159
Ew, ew!

08:38.240 --> 08:40.320
[all clamoring]

08:43.480 --> 08:45.679
[indistinct chatter and laughter]

08:46.880 --> 08:47.960
Dude, you're eating that?

08:48.880 --> 08:50.520
It's just peanut butter and bread.

08:50.600 --> 08:53.760
And sweat, dirt, dead skin.

08:55.080 --> 08:57.280
-[Brooke] Parker, you're disgusting.
-Yeah.

08:57.360 --> 08:59.280
Where are your manners?

08:59.360 --> 09:00.600
[all groaning]

09:26.080 --> 09:26.920
Hey.

09:28.040 --> 09:28.880
Hey.

09:29.720 --> 09:32.760
[sighs] Thanks for listening to me today.

09:33.320 --> 09:35.600
Thanks for telling me
I didn't know what I was doing.

09:35.680 --> 09:36.560
[chuckles]

09:36.640 --> 09:40.120
I'm happy to be your moral
and literal compass anytime, Cruz.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.760
We still make a pretty good team, Woods.

09:44.160 --> 09:45.320
[Daniel] Hey, babe.

09:45.400 --> 09:46.840
-Hey.
-Wanna go for a walk?

09:48.080 --> 09:49.000
Yeah, sure.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.680
All right. See you, dude.

09:52.080 --> 09:54.440

This is typical Eagle behavior.

11:59.880 --> 12:01.160
We should rename you the Vultures.

12:01.240 --> 12:04.080
I don't know how many times
I have to tell you, we didn't do it.

12:04.160 --> 12:05.640

-Right.

12:12.120 --> 12:14.560
-What? I was cold.
-[scoffs] Unbelievable.

12:15.440 --> 12:18.160
-Take it off.
-You're gonna tell me what to wear now?

12:18.240 --> 12:20.360
Whoa. Never tell a woman what to wear.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.640
-Yeah.
-[all] Yeah.

-We didn't do that!

12:26.800 --> 12:27.880
I did not...

12:27.960 --> 12:28.800
[Sophie] Did we?

12:28.880 --> 12:31.080
Oh, I suppose it was done
by a little critter

12:31.160 --> 12:32.320
who's a fan of the Eagles.

12:32.400 --> 12:33.320
Hey, hey, hey.

12:33.960 --> 12:35.960
Maybe someone's just trying
to mess with us.

12:36.040 --> 12:37.040
Who would do that?

12:37.120 --> 12:39.960
Or maybe... you guys did it to yourselves.

12:40.040 --> 12:41.000
[Becca scoffs]

12:41.080 --> 12:43.080
Maybe you wanted to start something.

12:43.160 --> 12:44.480
-Why would we do that?
-You tell me.

12:44.560 --> 12:46.600
Guys, stop. Stop, stop! This is crazy.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.880
If they say they didn't do it,
they didn't do it.

12:48.960 --> 12:49.880
These people are our friends.

12:49.960 --> 12:51.920
-No, they're not.
-[Hayley tuts and sighs]

12:55.240 --> 12:56.560
[Daniel] There.

12:57.160 --> 12:59.920
Happy now? Huh?
Now both flags are burnt.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.520
-What are you doing?
-Just forget it.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.000
And what about my guitar?

13:03.080 --> 13:04.240
Look, if you want,

13:04.320 --> 13:06.720
I'll slash all our basketballs
when we get back to make it even.

13:07.400 --> 13:09.040
Get over it, man. Come on.

13:11.960 --> 13:14.040
Good luck. Be strong, okay?

13:14.640 --> 13:17.160
[Sophie] Come on, Eagles. Let's go pack.

13:20.760 --> 13:22.040
Let's go.

13:27.640 --> 13:28.640
[sighs]

13:29.280 --> 13:30.600
Aren't you in the wrong group?

13:31.400 --> 13:32.640
Eagles went that way.

13:36.240 --> 13:38.920
Here. Happy?

13:39.480 --> 13:41.760
I'd be happier if you threw it off
the edge of a mountain.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.440
It's a sweatshirt.

13:45.120 --> 13:47.920
You're just trying to tear him apart,
aren't you?

13:48.000 --> 13:49.280
Stay out of this, Becca.

13:49.360 --> 13:52.960
I'm just standing up for my captain,
which is more than you can say.

13:54.080 --> 13:57.040
-Why don't you just go join the Eagles?
-Becca, stop.

14:00.800 --> 14:01.800
Traitor.

14:10.320 --> 14:12.680
[Sophie] Eagles, watch your step.
It's a little slippery.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.680
Thanks, Parker. Ooh!

14:18.200 --> 14:20.320
Hey, there's the flag. Let's go get it.

14:20.400 --> 14:21.800
I got it.

14:21.880 --> 14:23.520
Okay, that's what
I'm talking about, Parker.

14:24.880 --> 14:25.800
[Leo] There it is, guys.

14:26.480 --> 14:27.560
Look who showed up.

14:27.640 --> 14:30.120
-I'm not worried about a Raven.
-Yeah, Parker, come on.

14:30.200 --> 14:31.480
-Parker! Yeah!
-[Eagles cheer]

14:31.560 --> 14:32.800
All right, I'm gonna go in.

14:32.880 --> 14:34.120
[Daniel] That's right, Parker!

14:34.200 --> 14:35.720
-[Eagles cheering]
-You stay here.

14:35.800 --> 14:36.800
-[indistinct chatter]
-Ow!

14:37.440 --> 14:38.960
Come on, Parker. You got this.

14:39.040 --> 14:42.120
Do it. There you go, Parker, easy.

14:42.200 --> 14:44.960
All right, guys,
let's fill up our water bottles.

14:45.040 --> 14:47.120
-I've got the iodine pills.
-[indistinct chatter]

14:47.200 --> 14:49.080
[Ravens cheering]

14:58.080 --> 14:59.640
Yeah!

14:59.720 --> 15:02.040
Leo, careful. Those rocks are slippery.

15:03.160 --> 15:04.440
[chuckling]

15:06.640 --> 15:08.800
-Leo, are you okay?
-[Sophie] Nice one!

15:08.880 --> 15:10.360
-I'm fine, I'm fine.
-[Parker] Need some help?

15:11.160 --> 15:12.440
Get off me.

15:12.520 --> 15:13.480
[Daniel] Good job, Leo.

15:13.560 --> 15:15.040
[Eagles laughing]

15:18.440 --> 15:19.400
[Sophie] Nice one!

15:19.480 --> 15:21.600
Nice, dude. Good job.

15:23.760 --> 15:25.520
[Eagles cheering]

15:27.160 --> 15:28.480
-Oh!
-[indistinct chatter]

15:28.560 --> 15:31.600
-Whoa. Becca, what the heck?
-Becca! Hey, hey!

15:32.160 --> 15:33.200
[Brooke] Parker, are you okay?

15:33.280 --> 15:35.160
-[Hayley] Guys, stop! This is insane.
-Are you crazy?

15:35.240 --> 15:37.320
Stop. Everyone, stop. Stop.

15:38.440 --> 15:39.720
[clamoring]

15:44.040 --> 15:46.360
-They've been fighting since they woke up.
-[Louis] <i>Good.</i>

15:46.440 --> 15:48.560
I'm glad they're back
into a little healthy competition.

15:48.640 --> 15:52.120
They're trying to drown each other
in the river as we speak, Louis.

15:52.200 --> 15:53.360
Look, if there were any real trouble,

15:53.440 --> 15:55.400
they'd use the walkie-talkies
to call for help.

15:55.480 --> 15:58.040
And if they're true winners,
they'll tough it out.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.200
I don't know.

15:59.280 --> 16:01.400
You sure you don't wanna just call it
a tie and bring 'em back in?

16:02.800 --> 16:04.440
No, they need to finish this.

16:04.520 --> 16:07.200
There needs to be a winner and a loser
to keep the fire going.

16:07.280 --> 16:09.560
<i>Okay, boss. You call the shots.</i>

16:15.880 --> 16:16.960
[Hayley] That looks bad, Cruz.

16:17.880 --> 16:18.920
It's nothing.

16:21.520 --> 16:24.040
-What's this for?
-To clean off the blood.

16:24.120 --> 16:26.000
I thought you'd like
to mess this thing up a bit.

16:30.160 --> 16:32.360
Here, put that bandage on.

16:35.000 --> 16:35.960
[Emma] Sorry.

16:40.480 --> 16:42.160
All right. Let's move, Eagles.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.600
Let's get going, guys.

16:48.160 --> 16:50.280
[indistinct chatter]

16:55.320 --> 16:59.120
-Are you sure you're okay to walk?
-I hurt my hand, not my leg.

17:03.760 --> 17:04.760
[Daniel] Hey.

17:04.840 --> 17:06.720
We have room for one more, you know.

17:09.560 --> 17:10.960
[Leo] What's stopping you, Woods?

17:15.240 --> 17:17.119
You really want me to go, don't you?

17:18.160 --> 17:19.760
I really don't care.

17:24.079 --> 17:25.240
[Emma] Hayley, don't.

17:32.800 --> 17:35.360
[Eagles cheering]

17:36.440 --> 17:38.280
I didn't know Hayley was that upset.

17:39.120 --> 17:41.560
She's been dying to join them for weeks.

17:44.680 --> 17:45.520
Let's go.

17:46.360 --> 17:48.040
Ravens are gonna win this.

17:48.120 --> 17:50.960
Eagles are gonna realize
what a burden they've taken on.

18:02.800 --> 18:03.800
Hayley.

18:06.320 --> 18:07.720
[chuckling] Thanks.

18:10.720 --> 18:13.800
-You actually look better as an Eagle.
-You think?

18:13.880 --> 18:15.920
Wait. [sighs] Something's still not right.

18:19.040 --> 18:19.960
Here we go.

18:21.280 --> 18:22.400
Little bit of this.

18:23.800 --> 18:24.720
Uh-huh.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.200
And one of these. [chuckles]

18:27.280 --> 18:29.960
-[Sophie] Guys, we have a major problem.
-Now it's perfect.

18:30.040 --> 18:32.040
-I think I lost our iodine pills.
-[Brooke] Are you sure?

18:32.120 --> 18:34.960
Yeah, I mean, I... I thought I left them
by the river,

18:35.040 --> 18:37.440
but I looked everywhere. They're gone.

18:37.520 --> 18:39.640
-Wait, by the river?
-Yeah.

18:40.960 --> 18:42.440
What if the Ravens took them?

18:45.040 --> 18:48.000
I swear we didn't take them.
I mean, I didn't take them.

18:48.080 --> 18:51.000
It doesn't matter who took them.
We have no way to purify our water now.

18:51.080 --> 18:52.040
I think I should call Louis.

18:52.120 --> 18:54.080
No. Are you kidding? No. No way.

18:57.080 --> 18:59.800
-Alex, no, you could get Giardia or worse.
-[Hayley] Don't do that.

18:59.880 --> 19:00.720
Maybe it's fine.

19:01.520 --> 19:03.200
Maybe the river is clean.

19:03.760 --> 19:05.160
I don't think that's a good idea.

19:06.440 --> 19:07.840
-[Hayley] Alex, stop.
-[Sophie] Alex, no.

19:07.920 --> 19:08.880
Alex...

19:10.360 --> 19:11.360
[scoffs]

19:17.760 --> 19:18.680
[splutters]

19:19.840 --> 19:22.800
-[Brooke] You okay?
-Yeah. I'm fine, I'm fine.

19:23.480 --> 19:25.120
Come on, Eagles, let's go.

19:25.680 --> 19:27.040
[Daniel] All right, let's do it.

19:28.720 --> 19:30.800
[indistinct chatter]

19:30.880 --> 19:33.040
-Parker, do not drink that water.
-I'm not.

19:34.320 --> 19:35.960
Parker, what are you doing?

19:39.320 --> 19:42.520
-I'm throwing the Ravens off the trail.
-No, we can't do that. That's cheating.

19:42.600 --> 19:45.440
[sighs] You mean
like how they stole our iodine pills?

19:46.880 --> 19:47.800
I'm sick of them.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.920
[Emma] Maybe we missed the trail fork.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.240
I'm sure this is right.

19:59.320 --> 20:00.720
No, I think Emma's right.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.760
We went up too far
and we must've missed the trail sign.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.560
Maybe I can figure out
where we are from up here.

20:05.640 --> 20:08.400
-[Leo] Max, just be careful, okay?
-[Max grunts] It's fine.

20:10.120 --> 20:11.600
-[screaming]
-Oh, Max!

20:11.680 --> 20:12.760
-[Max] My ankle.
-Are you okay?

20:14.040 --> 20:16.120
-[Max panting]
-Can you walk?

20:16.200 --> 20:18.160
[grunts] I think so.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.560
I think not.

20:21.640 --> 20:24.000
Guys, we have to keep moving.
We're losing time.

20:24.080 --> 20:25.400
Leo, he can't walk.

20:25.480 --> 20:27.440
We need to call for help
on the walkie-talkie.

20:27.520 --> 20:28.800
No. We do that, we lose.

20:28.880 --> 20:31.960
You should keep going, captain.
Come back for me when you win.

20:32.040 --> 20:33.120
You sure?

20:37.520 --> 20:40.080
Okay, you heard him, guys.
Let's get moving, this way.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.320
I'm staying with Max.

20:43.840 --> 20:46.840
Fine. We'll come back for you, okay?
Let's go!

20:48.440 --> 20:49.440
[Max breathing heavily]

20:52.680 --> 20:53.720
[indistinct chatter]

20:59.000 --> 21:00.680
-[all exclaiming]
-[Hayley] Alex!

21:02.040 --> 21:04.160
-[Parker] Oh. Ugh.
-What do we do? Should I call Louis?

21:04.240 --> 21:05.680
-You have to.
-Yeah.

21:05.760 --> 21:07.640
No, let's just keep going now.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.000
[sighs] Just don't...
Just don't drink the water.

21:10.080 --> 21:11.240
But Alex, you're sick.

21:11.320 --> 21:12.800
[exhales heavily] I'm fine.

21:12.880 --> 21:15.120
-[Parker] Here, give me your bag.
-No, no.

21:16.520 --> 21:17.400
[Daniel] Let's go.

21:17.480 --> 21:19.080
[Sophie] Yeah, let's go. Come on, Eagles.

21:44.720 --> 21:45.760
[sighs heavily]

21:51.760 --> 21:53.560
Jackie's gonna be so worried about me.

21:54.120 --> 21:55.760
Like I'm sure you would be about Leaf.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.400
Oh, yeah.

22:00.960 --> 22:01.800
Max...

22:03.280 --> 22:04.840
Leaf is actually...

22:06.680 --> 22:07.520
Actually what?

22:09.320 --> 22:10.280
He's...

22:12.120 --> 22:14.880
He's actually a really great athlete,

22:14.960 --> 22:17.520
so he wouldn't really be
in this kind of situation.

22:18.240 --> 22:19.240
Oh.

22:21.600 --> 22:22.600
Well, that makes sense.

22:24.320 --> 22:25.640
[breathing heavily]

22:29.240 --> 22:31.160
There it is.
There's the last flag. We made it!

22:32.080 --> 22:33.160
So did they.

22:43.600 --> 22:44.480
What's wrong with him?

22:45.040 --> 22:47.320
He's sick, thanks to you guys.

22:47.400 --> 22:50.440
-What are you talking about?
-You stole our iodine pills.

22:51.600 --> 22:55.400
No, we didn't. But Max sprained his ankle
because you guys moved the trail sign.

22:55.480 --> 22:56.760
What? No, we didn't.

22:56.840 --> 22:58.640
-Whoa!
-[Hayley] Alex. Alex.

22:59.440 --> 23:00.680
[Alex breathing heavily]

23:06.920 --> 23:08.280
Let's just finish this.

23:09.120 --> 23:10.040
Agreed.

23:13.200 --> 23:14.560
Go get it, D!

23:17.600 --> 23:18.800
You're not gonna win.

23:19.480 --> 23:21.440
[panting] Hayley's with me. I already did.

23:33.240 --> 23:34.440
[grunting]

23:37.680 --> 23:39.080
Come and get it, huh?

23:39.160 --> 23:41.880
Yeah. Come on.

23:42.520 --> 23:44.760
Go ahead. I'd rather take the win.

24:00.240 --> 24:01.120
Come on!

24:04.200 --> 24:06.880
Daniel, stop!
I'm your captain. I say stop!

24:06.960 --> 24:08.040
[breathing heavily]

24:08.600 --> 24:10.080
-Daniel, please don't hurt him.
-[grunting]

24:12.800 --> 24:14.000
It's over, guys.

24:14.080 --> 24:16.240
-No, it's not!
-Leo, stop.

24:16.320 --> 24:18.640
Alex and Max are hurt.
We all decided to call for help.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.600
No way. I'm the Ravens' captain,
I haven't decided anything.

24:22.400 --> 24:23.920
Do not set that off, you haven't won!

24:24.000 --> 24:25.440
I'm not trying to win! [exclaims]

24:26.040 --> 24:27.200
[Sophie screaming]

24:27.920 --> 24:29.160
I got you. I got you, hang on.

24:29.240 --> 24:31.280
-Help me up!
-Hang on. Hang on.

24:31.360 --> 24:33.400
-I got you.
-Oh, I can't! My hand is slipping!

24:33.480 --> 24:36.120
-Hang on! [grunting]
-[Sophie] I can't hold on!

24:36.200 --> 24:37.480
Help me up!

24:37.560 --> 24:38.400
[screaming]

24:41.640 --> 24:43.640
["Gone" playing]
