WEBVTT

00:02.152 --> 00:05.412
Ladies and gentlemen,
today is a very big day.

00:06.415 --> 00:08.749
I don't need to tell you
how ruthless our suspect is.

00:08.901 --> 00:11.902
<i> He's a public menace</i>
<i>responsible for tens of millions</i>

00:11.995 --> 00:13.995
in property damage.

00:14.015 --> 00:16.089
<i> He has burned, maimed</i>

00:16.242 --> 00:18.258
<i> and killed innocent people.</i>

00:18.410 --> 00:20.552
And he's done it all
while hiding in plain sight.

00:20.704 --> 00:24.506
<i> Oh, he thinks</i>
<i> he's smarter than us.</i>

00:24.641 --> 00:25.916
And for too long,

00:26.009 --> 00:27.934
<i> he's been right.</i>

00:28.087 --> 00:29.586
Now, make no mistake,

00:29.605 --> 00:31.922
<i> this man is a dangerous</i>
<i> sociopath who will do</i>

00:32.015 --> 00:34.074
anything to avoid capture.

00:35.944 --> 00:38.019
<i> So, keep your head up,</i>
<i> watch your six...</i>

00:38.039 --> 00:40.873
-(officers clamoring)
-...and let's get
this son of a bitch.

00:41.100 --> 00:43.283
(indistinct shouting)

00:43.435 --> 00:45.335
-Get him up.
-(handcuffs clicking)

00:46.863 --> 00:49.956
Owen Strand, you are under
arrest for criminal trespass,

00:50.109 --> 00:51.775
reckless destruction
of property,

00:51.794 --> 00:53.701
aggravated assault and arson.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.679
Get him out of here.

01:01.787 --> 01:03.136
JACOBS: Captain Strand.

01:03.230 --> 01:04.879
Good to see you're up.

01:04.899 --> 01:07.399
It's good to see you,
Dr. Jacobs.

01:07.626 --> 01:08.792
How you feeling?

01:08.885 --> 01:10.552
If I were in the game
of<i> Operation,</i>

01:10.646 --> 01:13.130
-I wouldn't have buzzed once.
-Mm.

01:13.148 --> 01:14.573
Well, I am afraid to say

01:14.800 --> 01:16.983
you would have one time,
unfortunately.

01:17.136 --> 01:18.226
Is there a complication?

01:18.320 --> 01:19.894
No, not a complication, exactly.

01:19.988 --> 01:21.471
Just, during surgery,
we discovered

01:21.565 --> 01:23.640
your tumor was larger
than we anticipated.

01:23.733 --> 01:26.401
What does that mean?
Did you get everything?

01:26.495 --> 01:28.161
Absolutely. It just means
that your recovery

01:28.255 --> 01:29.813
will take longer
than we expected.

01:29.832 --> 01:32.833
So, six days instead of five?

01:32.985 --> 01:35.577
Uh, more like
three to four weeks.

01:35.596 --> 01:36.929
OWEN: Three to four weeks?

01:37.080 --> 01:40.006
Doctor, I can't be away
from work that long.

01:40.159 --> 01:41.416
The taxpayers need me.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.510
Dad, I'm sure the taxpayers
will understand.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.512
JACOBS: Well, until your
O2 levels return to normal,

01:45.664 --> 01:48.332
you will experience
shortness of breath,

01:48.350 --> 01:49.683
fatigue, coughing.

01:49.835 --> 01:53.170
But the good news is all
you need to do to feel better

01:53.188 --> 01:55.614
is to kick your legs up
and relax.

01:55.765 --> 01:57.341
That's not good news for my dad.

01:57.434 --> 01:59.526
JACOBS: Well, either way,
the takeaway here is

01:59.620 --> 02:00.677
it was a success.

02:00.770 --> 02:03.196
Now, I will want
to keep you overnight,

02:03.290 --> 02:05.182
but you should be good
to go tomorrow.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.441
All right, well,
thank you, Doctor.

02:06.535 --> 02:08.627
-You're so welcome. Mm-hmm.
-Thank you.

02:08.778 --> 02:11.188
-(door closes)
-Four weeks?

02:11.206 --> 02:12.689
That's like two fortnights.

02:12.708 --> 02:14.800
Eh, don't worry, we'll find
a way to pass the time.

02:14.951 --> 02:17.761
-Oh, that reminds me.
-(Velcro tearing)

02:18.955 --> 02:21.723
Carlos and I
brought you something.

02:23.202 --> 02:25.293
You guys, you didn't
have to do that.

02:25.387 --> 02:27.479
Oh, you can just
take the lid off.

02:27.665 --> 02:31.316
Oh. It's a puzzle.

02:34.546 --> 02:36.213
You hate it.

02:36.231 --> 02:38.139
No, I-I love it.
Lookit...

02:38.159 --> 02:40.717
I love poker and I love dogs,

02:40.736 --> 02:41.994
and I have both of them
right here.

02:42.221 --> 02:44.496
I haven't done one of these
since I was seven.

02:44.723 --> 02:46.556
Yeah, 'cause you haven't sat
still long enough to try one.

02:46.575 --> 02:49.409
And here's a tip:
start with the corners.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.545
(tablet ringing)

02:53.749 --> 02:56.625
Oh. I believe this is for you.

02:57.661 --> 02:59.994
<i> -Oh!</i>
<i> -There he is!</i>
<i> -What up?</i>

03:00.014 --> 03:01.571
(laughs) You guys are the best.

03:01.665 --> 03:03.665
<i> -How you doing, Cap?</i>
-That's a question for you.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.409
How <i> you</i>   doing, Cap?

03:05.502 --> 03:07.001
<i> JUDD:</i>
<i>I'm just keeping your seat warm.</i>

03:07.095 --> 03:08.470
<i>Although he did say he was gonna</i>
<i> sell your espresso machine</i>

03:08.580 --> 03:11.005
<i> -for a mechanical bull.</i>
<i> -That would be so dope.</i>

03:11.025 --> 03:13.600
You guys are so fired.

03:13.752 --> 03:15.602
Oh, probie,
did you water the philodendron

03:15.696 --> 03:17.029
in the house this morning?

03:17.180 --> 03:18.922
<i> I almost did.</i>

03:19.015 --> 03:20.941
<i> But I remembered</i>
<i> to water the dog, though.</i>

03:21.093 --> 03:22.517
Close enough.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.611
Doc says I'll be home
by tomorrow, by the way.

03:24.763 --> 03:26.521
<i> Cool, I'll have the tequila</i>
<i> standing by.</i>

03:26.540 --> 03:28.916
Hey, no booze
while he's on painkillers.

03:29.025 --> 03:30.358
<i> Okay, so, home tomorrow,</i>
<i> and then how long</i>

03:30.377 --> 03:31.359
<i> till you're back</i>
<i> at the firehouse?</i>

03:31.378 --> 03:32.860
I'm shooting for ten days.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.881
No, it's three weeks, minimum,
and-and that's pushing it.

03:36.032 --> 03:37.274
<i>JUDD: Look, take your time, Cap.</i>

03:37.292 --> 03:38.700
<i> There ain't nothing</i>
<i> to worry about,</i>

03:38.794 --> 03:40.627
<i> all right? It's been</i>
<i> pretty quiet around here.</i>

03:40.721 --> 03:43.447
<i> -(alarm ringing)</i>
<i> -Why'd you have to</i>
<i> jinx it, Judd?</i>

03:43.465 --> 03:46.967
Have fun storming the castle.
Be safe.

03:47.061 --> 03:49.519
-(siren wailing)
-(horn honking)

03:55.552 --> 03:57.569
Captain Ryder,
welcome to the show.

03:57.679 --> 03:59.813
-Still sounds funny hearing it.
-You'll get used to it.

03:59.965 --> 04:01.240
Yeah, well, I better.
I just found out

04:01.467 --> 04:02.816
Owen's gonna be out
for another month.

04:02.968 --> 04:04.409
-Is he okay?
-Yeah, he'll be fine.

04:04.561 --> 04:06.970
-What do we got?
-Car blew out a tire.

04:06.989 --> 04:08.247
Hit the guardrail, spun out

04:08.398 --> 04:10.916
and clipped the truck
that was towing the boat.

04:11.067 --> 04:12.325
Right. So where's the truck?

04:12.478 --> 04:15.087
That's where y'all come in.

04:18.650 --> 04:20.259
McKENNA: Please help us!

04:23.764 --> 04:27.491
Okay, 126, let's back
that engine up to the rail.

04:27.584 --> 04:29.175
Chavez, you're gonna be
with me on the winches.

04:29.328 --> 04:31.011
Marwani, Strickland,
y'all get harnessed up.

04:31.163 --> 04:32.587
Y'all are on rescue, and let's
be fast, because that chain

04:32.681 --> 04:34.255
ain't long for this world.

04:34.349 --> 04:35.440
MATEO: Copy that, Cap.
You think we should put

04:35.667 --> 04:37.091
the rescue cushion
out on the ground?

04:37.111 --> 04:39.111
There's no point,
not this high up.

04:39.262 --> 04:40.779
PAUL: <i> Zombie Paradise?</i>

04:41.006 --> 04:42.522
Why would anybody
name their boat that?

04:42.658 --> 04:44.841
You'll have to remember to ask
them when we get down there.

04:44.860 --> 04:47.027
-Let's do it.
-MAN: Hey, it's FireFox.

04:47.179 --> 04:48.102
Are you FireFox?

04:48.122 --> 04:49.863
-Guilty.
-Oh, my God, you guys.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.291
She's, like, the Serena Williams
of firefighters.

04:52.442 --> 04:54.701
Say something to my followers.
9,000 are watching.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.278
-Please.
-Uh, keep calm, carry on

04:57.372 --> 04:59.539
and feel free
to like me on Insta.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.800
Anyways, going down.

05:02.027 --> 05:03.318
Is she not the coolest?

05:03.320 --> 05:05.787
You got the winch up.
Stay light, stay sharp.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.365
If that truck starts to go,
kick out. No hero stuff.

05:08.383 --> 05:10.642
Kind of in
the job description, no?

05:10.794 --> 05:12.102
(sighs)

05:13.480 --> 05:16.690
-PAUL: Good, good.
-JUDD: All right,
slow and steady.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.133
Nice and light.

05:19.153 --> 05:20.877
Good, good, good.

05:20.896 --> 05:22.546
Austin Fire.
We're coming to you.

05:22.564 --> 05:23.897
McKENNA:
Oh, thank God.

05:24.049 --> 05:25.139
Please hurry.

05:25.159 --> 05:27.308
Hey, Marj, you smell that?

05:27.402 --> 05:29.536
Yeah. Fuel.

05:30.980 --> 05:33.223
-All right, topside, we're good.
-Kill the winch!

05:33.241 --> 05:35.241
PAUL:
Austin FD. We're gonna
get you out of here, okay?

05:35.394 --> 05:36.726
I just need you
to try to remain still.

05:36.820 --> 05:39.338
Okay. I told you
they'd make it in time.

05:39.565 --> 05:41.081
Yes, you did, baby,
yes, you did.

05:41.233 --> 05:42.248
Is anybody hurt or in pain?

05:42.401 --> 05:43.675
-Just some scrapes.
-Uh...

05:43.902 --> 05:46.345
My legs are-are pinned
under the wheel.

05:46.496 --> 05:49.473
-Otherwise I'm fine.
-PAUL: We're gonna open
the door now, all right?

05:59.585 --> 06:02.009

under the wheel.

06:03.680 --> 06:05.530
Hey.
Don't sweat it.

06:05.757 --> 06:07.424
They're sending me down the tool
that's gonna pop this right off.

06:07.442 --> 06:09.517
My name's Marjan
and that's Paul.

06:09.536 --> 06:12.278
-McKenna. My husband's Brady.
-PAUL: Husband?

06:12.431 --> 06:14.206
-You two are babies.
-(chuckles)

06:14.357 --> 06:15.540
How long you been married?

06:15.692 --> 06:16.708
Uh, four years this July.

06:16.901 --> 06:18.192
Can you unbuckle
your seat belt for me?

06:18.212 --> 06:20.045
No.
It's stuck.

06:20.196 --> 06:21.863
I'm gonna cut you out, okay?

<i>The chain won't be able to hold</i>

-MARJAN: Copy that.
-So,

06:33.485 --> 06:35.376
what made you two
decide to rush in?

06:35.396 --> 06:37.545
Sounds crazy, right--
doing it so young?

06:37.564 --> 06:39.806
Not to me.
I got engaged when I was 12.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.067
-Real talk.
-Wow.

06:42.218 --> 06:43.217
My parents said I should wait

06:43.237 --> 06:44.811
until I figured out
who I really was.

06:44.963 --> 06:46.571
But I knew.

06:46.798 --> 06:47.981
I wanted to be his partner.

It's time to go.

Uh... uh, dumb joke
between M-McKenna and I.

What major body of water are you
hoping to escape to in Austin--

08:01.873 --> 08:03.389
Lake Travis?

08:03.484 --> 08:05.466

didn't think it through...

in my head, you know?

08:57.763 --> 09:00.613
Like-like, maybe if we had
tried to secure the truck

09:00.707 --> 09:03.099
before I sent Marjan and Paul
down, I... Maybe...

09:03.118 --> 09:05.101
You didn't have time.

09:05.120 --> 09:08.454
You saved the passenger.
That's what you should focus on.

09:08.607 --> 09:10.290
If you'd had delayed
that rescue,

09:10.384 --> 09:11.866
you could've lost them both.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.294
But it's like...

09:14.446 --> 09:16.871
what if we could have
saved them both?

09:16.890 --> 09:18.515
You're never gonna know.

09:19.467 --> 09:22.227
That's the curse
of being captain.

09:23.121 --> 09:25.880
I ain't sure I'm cut out for it.

09:25.974 --> 09:27.457
It's always this way?

09:27.475 --> 09:30.293
-Every time.
-So, then, how do you keep,

09:30.312 --> 09:32.812
you know, your mind
from going into a spin cycle

09:32.964 --> 09:34.314
every time you show up
for a call?

09:34.466 --> 09:36.891
We're in the uncertainty
business.

09:36.985 --> 09:38.410
They don't give you
the captain's helmet

09:38.561 --> 09:40.394
because you know
all of the answers.

09:40.414 --> 09:43.230
They give it to you
because you can be decisive

09:43.325 --> 09:44.398
even when you don't.

09:44.492 --> 09:48.244
And then live
with the consequences.

09:49.331 --> 09:52.165
Heavy is the head
that wears that helmet.

09:52.317 --> 09:54.408
Heavy is the head.

09:54.502 --> 09:56.836
(exhales) Well, you could have
told me that

09:56.988 --> 09:58.838
before asking me
to put it on, you know.

09:58.990 --> 10:00.432
Then you might not
have taken the job.

10:00.583 --> 10:04.177
Look, Judd, I chose you
to hold down the fort

10:04.329 --> 10:07.397
because I know who you are.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.018
-I appreciate that, Cap.
-Coffee?

10:12.929 --> 10:14.446
Hey, speaking of
holding down the forts,

10:14.673 --> 10:18.875
how, uh, how was
your first day off of work?

10:18.877 --> 10:20.042
Relaxing.

10:20.044 --> 10:22.269
I did some tai chi.

10:22.364 --> 10:23.863
Finally started
that Churchill biography

10:24.015 --> 10:29.110
I've been meaning to get into
and TK got me a little puzzle.

10:29.204 --> 10:31.463
Ah. The one with
the-the shrink-wrap still on it?

10:31.614 --> 10:33.189
I'll get to it.

10:33.208 --> 10:35.508
You're-you're climbing up
the walls, ain't you?

10:36.378 --> 10:38.361
-Yeah. Yeah.
-(both laugh)

10:38.380 --> 10:40.029
(chuckles)

10:40.048 --> 10:41.547
You know who you should call?

10:41.642 --> 10:43.308
-Who?
-Billy.

10:43.459 --> 10:45.869
Billy... Billy Tyson Billy?

10:45.887 --> 10:47.887
Uh, yeah, your old
best frenemy Billy.

10:48.039 --> 10:49.814
Oh, man, he's too busy
running his firehouse

10:50.041 --> 10:51.132
to come hang out with me.

10:51.226 --> 10:53.526
Oh, you haven't heard,
have you?

10:55.063 --> 10:59.324
Thyroid cancer came roaring back
after the holidays.

10:59.475 --> 11:01.618
At first I thought
I had COVID...

11:03.054 --> 11:04.554
Which I did.
(chuckles)

11:04.572 --> 11:05.889
Ugh.

11:05.982 --> 11:08.741
Anyway, uh, this time
it spread to my lymph nodes.

11:08.894 --> 11:10.560
I'm so sorry
to hear that, Billy.

11:10.653 --> 11:12.671
And I'm sorry
I didn't keep in contact.

11:12.898 --> 11:14.172
Don't give me that

11:14.399 --> 11:16.566
"Oh, poor you" look,
New York. Okay?

11:16.584 --> 11:19.010
I whupped its ass once before,
I will do it again.

11:19.162 --> 11:22.329
I have no doubt, Texas.

11:22.349 --> 11:25.909
What are you doing
playing hooky from work,

11:26.002 --> 11:27.168
come to see me
in my humble abode?

11:27.262 --> 11:29.187
There's nothing humble
about this abode.

11:29.414 --> 11:31.097
I mean that as a compliment.

11:31.249 --> 11:33.191
Particularly if you like
antlers.

11:33.418 --> 11:35.919
All right, smartass,
you're gonna be the next head

11:36.012 --> 11:38.938
-up on that wall.
-(laughs)

11:39.090 --> 11:40.106
No, I'm, uh...

11:40.200 --> 11:42.867
I had my wedge resection
surgery.

11:43.019 --> 11:45.036
So I'm convalescing.

11:45.263 --> 11:49.416
So you're officially
cancer-free?

11:50.544 --> 11:53.770
Yeah.
For now.

11:53.863 --> 11:55.455
(exhales sharply)

11:55.607 --> 11:58.866
Well, hell, buddy, that is...
That-that's great news.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.960
Good for you, man.
I mean it.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.721
Thank you.
Thank you, Billy.

12:02.872 --> 12:06.040
Uh, how long you supposed
to be convalescing?

12:06.134 --> 12:07.225
Two weeks or so.

12:07.452 --> 12:09.802
-They told you a month, right?
-(laughs)

12:09.896 --> 12:11.955
Yeah, they pretty much did.

12:11.973 --> 12:13.806
For working dogs like us,

12:13.900 --> 12:15.400
that might as well
be an eternity.

12:15.627 --> 12:17.310
But I'm gonna keep busy.

12:17.462 --> 12:19.796
I have some, uh,
meditation tapes.

12:19.889 --> 12:22.966
I'm gonna paint my bathroom
and, uh,

12:22.984 --> 12:25.410
maybe re-pot some plants.

12:25.637 --> 12:27.394
Good God, New York,

12:27.414 --> 12:28.471
I got a triple espresso here,

12:28.564 --> 12:29.655
and you're still
putting me to sleep.

need help finishing this up?

16:42.651 --> 16:44.502
What makes you think
I want it done faster?

16:44.729 --> 16:46.153
Because painting sucks.

<i> Hey, I started the puzzle.</i>

19:28.817 --> 19:31.560
You're right, beginning
in the corners-- game changer.

19:31.654 --> 19:34.672

I'm so glad. Hey, uh,

19:34.899 --> 19:36.916

getting shot this time.

19:42.831 --> 19:44.423

1840 Pecos?
That's right nearby.

20:07.356 --> 20:09.540
Uh, yeah, I think it's, like,
three blocks that way.

20:10.435 --> 20:13.294
Hey, you forgot your juice.

20:19.794 --> 20:21.277
Hey!

20:21.295 --> 20:23.870
Hey! Hey, anybody here?

20:23.965 --> 20:26.098
Hey! Hey!

-Hey, stop.

Okay, is there
anyone else in there?

20:45.653 --> 20:48.395
Gerald. He was in the back.
He's trapped in the back.

20:48.489 --> 20:49.989
Okay, okay, all right.
You hold still.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.733
Help is on the way.

20:52.827 --> 20:55.235
Gerald!

20:55.255 --> 20:58.739
Gerald, are you in here?

20:58.758 --> 21:00.591
Gerald?

21:00.743 --> 21:03.010
(loud crash)

21:05.990 --> 21:08.340
Over here! Help!

21:08.493 --> 21:09.842
I can't see!
I can't see!

21:09.936 --> 21:11.494
Stop!
Stop running!

21:11.512 --> 21:13.496
-I'm coming to you.
-(coughing)

21:13.514 --> 21:14.939
Over here!

21:15.166 --> 21:17.016
(coughing)

21:17.168 --> 21:18.943
-I'm right here.
-I can't see.

21:19.094 --> 21:20.260
I think you had a flashover.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.928
It can make you
temporarily blind.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.281
(coughing)

21:23.432 --> 21:26.842
Okay... put this over your face.

21:26.861 --> 21:28.027
(grunting)

21:28.121 --> 21:30.371
Try not to breathe!

21:47.532 --> 21:50.308
(sirens wailing)

21:59.393 --> 22:01.393
All right, hey, Gallagher,
Ricardo, get over there

22:01.546 --> 22:03.228
and give first aid to them
till medical gets here.

22:03.323 --> 22:05.531
Marwani, let's get
that two and a half hooked up.

22:06.717 --> 22:08.475
What the hell you doing here?

22:08.494 --> 22:10.995
-I was in the area.
-Talk about Johnny on the Spot.

22:11.146 --> 22:13.164
Look, we're dealing with arson.

22:13.273 --> 22:15.574
I saw signs of accelerant
in there, so be careful.

22:15.726 --> 22:17.409
Okay, why don't you go
get checked out by the med?

22:17.503 --> 22:19.170
-Yeah?
-No, no, no. No, I'm good.

22:19.321 --> 22:21.655
All right, fire began
in the northwest corner,

22:21.674 --> 22:23.566
so we let's concentrate
on that wall.

22:23.584 --> 22:26.326
Paul, Mateo, get up that ladder
and get ready to ventilate.

22:26.420 --> 22:28.054
Sure thing, Cap.

22:29.665 --> 22:31.331
Cap, you got to get out
of the street tonight, okay?

22:31.351 --> 22:32.850
You're not caption tonight,
you're a civilian.

22:33.001 --> 22:34.577
Okay?

22:34.670 --> 22:36.579
You got to go, Owen,
you got to go.

22:36.597 --> 22:39.339
All right, you're right,
you're right, Captain.

22:39.433 --> 22:41.250
It's your scene.

22:41.268 --> 22:45.029
126, give 'em hell.

22:59.712 --> 23:00.936
Hey, Cap, this is

23:01.029 --> 23:03.864
AFD Arson Investigator
Dennis Raymond.

23:03.958 --> 23:05.198
He's here to take your statement

23:05.218 --> 23:06.609
about what you saw
at the fire last night.

23:06.702 --> 23:08.368
-Good to meet you, Investigator.
-It's an honor.

23:08.388 --> 23:11.555
I've been following your career
since you got to Austin.

23:12.450 --> 23:15.893
Do you mind if I use
your desk, Captain Ryder?

23:16.044 --> 23:18.637
-You mean,<i> our</i> desk.
-(laughter)

23:18.731 --> 23:20.564
Yeah, sure, go ahead, go ahead.

23:20.791 --> 23:22.650
Okay.
(clears throat)

23:26.631 --> 23:29.073
So, according to...

23:29.224 --> 23:31.558
Captain Ryder's I.R...

23:31.577 --> 23:33.986
upon leaving the...

23:34.080 --> 23:36.822
structure fire at 1840 Pecos

23:36.916 --> 23:38.307
Thursday, you stated

23:38.400 --> 23:40.826
that you were certain
it was arson.

23:40.978 --> 23:42.086
That's right.

23:42.313 --> 23:45.147
Okay, can you walk me through,
uh, what led you

23:45.166 --> 23:47.666
to that conclusion?
But first, um,

23:47.818 --> 23:50.836
maybe start with how you
arrived five minutes

23:50.930 --> 23:53.580
before the fire company?

23:53.599 --> 23:54.915
I was in the neighborhood.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.583
I was at a coffee shop
getting a green juice.

23:56.677 --> 23:59.920
Yeah, he drinks that stuff
by the gallon.

24:00.014 --> 24:01.439
Small thing, um...

24:01.590 --> 24:04.442
if I'm not mistaken,
the textile shop

24:04.593 --> 24:06.018
is three blocks

24:06.170 --> 24:08.504
in the opposite direction

24:08.522 --> 24:10.355
of your home
from the coffee shop.

24:10.508 --> 24:13.509
So why were you headed...
headed that way?

24:13.527 --> 24:17.288
I was listening
to the Austin, uh, FD

24:17.515 --> 24:19.331
911 app.

24:20.034 --> 24:22.418
May I inquire as to why?

24:23.296 --> 24:25.053
For fun.

24:25.113 --> 24:27.614
But, uh, anyway,
I-I heard the call come out

24:27.633 --> 24:29.525
and I got to the scene
as fast as I could,

24:29.543 --> 24:31.302
and right away,
I felt something was wrong.

24:31.529 --> 24:33.119
Oh, you felt it?

24:33.214 --> 24:35.431
Yeah?
Felt it in your gut?

24:36.959 --> 24:39.551
Yeah, the fire was
too fast too quick.

24:39.704 --> 24:40.961
And then I saw him.

24:41.055 --> 24:42.705
Yes, the, uh...

24:42.723 --> 24:44.890
the man in the hoodie.
Uh...

24:45.042 --> 24:47.300
Uh, Captain Ryder
put that in his I.R.

24:47.394 --> 24:49.712
Would-would you mind
describing him for me?

24:49.730 --> 24:51.471
Five, ten... ish.

24:51.565 --> 24:53.398
Medium build.

24:53.551 --> 24:56.327
Medium build?
That's it?

24:56.478 --> 24:58.645
Well, it was dark
and he had his back to me.

24:58.664 --> 25:00.405
So how do you know it was a him?

25:00.558 --> 25:02.074
Well, I don't.

25:02.226 --> 25:04.059
But I know the profile
of an arsonist.

25:04.152 --> 25:06.170
And what would that be?

25:06.397 --> 25:09.414
Loner male... feels inadequate,

25:09.509 --> 25:12.084
wants to exert some sort
of power in his life. Look,

25:12.236 --> 25:14.253
I think if you go back and look
at the security cameras

25:14.347 --> 25:16.013
in the area
you're gonna find him.

25:16.164 --> 25:18.516
We did, uh, actually.

25:18.743 --> 25:20.743
Nothing.

25:20.761 --> 25:23.020
OWEN:
Look, the burn patterns

25:23.171 --> 25:25.338
at the point of origin
were classic

25:25.358 --> 25:27.416
sharp V--
telltale sign of arson.

25:27.434 --> 25:28.934
Yes, it can be.

25:29.028 --> 25:31.011
But not always.

25:31.030 --> 25:34.198
I've been doing this
over 30 years, Investigator.

25:34.349 --> 25:36.516
Fire doesn't move
that quickly without help.

25:36.610 --> 25:40.538
The dogs found
no traces of accelerant.

25:40.765 --> 25:42.373
I spoke with the cleaners.

25:42.524 --> 25:45.358
And they didn't see anything
or anyone suspicious.

25:45.378 --> 25:47.770
Well, then he had a clever way
of setting it off.

25:47.863 --> 25:49.213
-Look, I saw alligator char.
-Mm-hmm.

25:49.364 --> 25:50.939
You don't get scales
that deep or that shiny

25:51.033 --> 25:53.125
without an accelerant.
This is arson.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.627
It was sophisticated,
it was deadly.

25:55.780 --> 25:58.038
And it's gonna happen again,
'cause this guy's not gonna stop

25:58.132 --> 26:00.949
until he gets caught.
(coughs)

26:00.968 --> 26:02.726
You want a glass of water, Cap?

26:02.953 --> 26:05.211
No, no, I'm-I'm...

26:05.231 --> 26:07.623
I'm fine, it's just
my lungs are a little...

26:07.716 --> 26:10.109
tight from the surgery.

26:12.054 --> 26:15.480
Captain Strand, I understand,
recently, that you...

26:15.575 --> 26:18.133
discovered some explosives
that cracked

26:18.226 --> 26:20.135
a major case
for the Texas Rangers.

26:20.154 --> 26:21.970
I-I read you, personally,

26:21.989 --> 26:24.915
tracked down
the perpetrators yourself.

26:25.067 --> 26:27.751
Well, I was-I was just
trying to help my son.

26:27.978 --> 26:29.736
Still, that...
(chuckles)

26:29.830 --> 26:32.831
that must have been
a thrill, right?

26:32.983 --> 26:35.500
And it might be tempting

26:35.653 --> 26:38.003
to want to break open
another one

26:38.097 --> 26:40.823
with all that free time
you have on your hands?

26:41.767 --> 26:44.926
Yeah, look, this isn't
about me getting a new hobby.

26:45.754 --> 26:47.329
If you go back to that scene,

26:47.422 --> 26:50.165
you're gonna find something.

26:50.184 --> 26:52.109
I promise you we will leave

26:52.336 --> 26:54.169
no stone unturned.

26:54.262 --> 26:57.031
Thank you so much
for coming down.

27:01.679 --> 27:03.287
-Hey, Marjan.
-Hey.

27:03.514 --> 27:04.513
How you doing?

27:04.531 --> 27:06.181
Honestly, I've been better.

27:06.200 --> 27:08.517
The whole
"down with FireFox" thing?

27:08.535 --> 27:09.852
I'm so sorry.

27:09.870 --> 27:11.536
What a bunch of BS.
Don't listen to the haters.

27:11.631 --> 27:14.373
It's kind of tricky when
every time I look at my phone,

27:14.525 --> 27:16.116
there are so many more of them.

27:16.135 --> 27:18.135
Well, one good thing
about derby--

27:18.362 --> 27:19.711
you can't skate on your phone.

27:19.864 --> 27:21.472
Yeah, thank God for that,
'cause I'm just getting into it

27:21.699 --> 27:23.456
with some tool who said
the reason I didn't save

27:23.476 --> 27:25.809
McKenna's husband is 'cause
I didn't want to break a nail.

27:25.961 --> 27:28.461
Hey, ladies.
Everybody, bring it in.

27:28.597 --> 27:29.462
I got some bad news.

27:29.482 --> 27:30.964
What's going on?

27:31.133 --> 27:33.800
I was just on with the people
from the Houston Invitational.

27:33.819 --> 27:36.211
It seems they're leaning
towards uninviting us

27:36.230 --> 27:38.046
from the tournament.

27:38.140 --> 27:39.657
This last-minute?
Why?

27:39.808 --> 27:41.400
Uh, who knows?

27:41.552 --> 27:43.235
Probably 'cause they're scared
we're gonna mop the floor

27:43.387 --> 27:45.645
with them again
like we did last year.

27:45.739 --> 27:47.389
It's 'cause of me, isn't it?

27:47.408 --> 27:50.334
They don't want FireFox there.

27:51.245 --> 27:52.577
Given everything
that's happened,

27:52.730 --> 27:54.913
they feel like it would
be insensitive to the woman

27:55.065 --> 27:57.232
who lost her husband
for you to compete.

27:57.292 --> 27:59.325
-That's ridiculous.
-Of course it is.

27:59.345 --> 28:01.236
Which is why we're withdrawing.

28:01.255 --> 28:02.680
I'm the captain of this team.

28:02.831 --> 28:05.165
Nobody tells me who can
lace up for the Annihilators.

28:05.259 --> 28:07.092
Unless I'm around.

28:07.244 --> 28:09.002
Well, then so be it.

28:09.096 --> 28:11.504
Look, you saved my life
on the rink that day.

28:11.524 --> 28:14.358
My arm was a spaghetti noodle
when I met you.

28:14.509 --> 28:16.268
I'm with Tonya.
If they try to cancel you,

28:16.362 --> 28:18.178
they'll have
to cancel all of us.

28:18.197 --> 28:21.031
Yeah Ride or die, bitches.

28:22.702 --> 28:24.593
Look, uh,

28:24.611 --> 28:27.204
you all are so awesome.

28:27.431 --> 28:30.098
I'm don't want to ruin
this for everybody, so...

28:30.117 --> 28:33.419
call them back, Julie,
and tell them I'm stepping down.

28:37.199 --> 28:39.049
GRACE:
Charles, this filet

28:39.159 --> 28:41.385
was beyond, right?

28:41.612 --> 28:43.111
Man, that's for real.

28:43.130 --> 28:45.297
-What-What's in your sauce?
-Oh, uh...

28:45.449 --> 28:47.707
smoked hickory, white vinegar
and jackfruit.

28:47.727 --> 28:50.060
I don't know
what a jackfruit is,

28:50.212 --> 28:51.562
but you can consider me a fan.

28:51.713 --> 28:54.898
Well, it's a pulpy fruit,
uh, native to India.

28:55.125 --> 28:57.717
Known for its sweet
and savory flavors.

28:57.737 --> 29:00.128
-Come on, Charles.
-(laughter)

29:00.147 --> 29:02.147
Charles is thinking
about putting it on the menu.

29:02.299 --> 29:05.743
Oh, okay, you said menu.
What menu?

29:05.894 --> 29:07.819
Oh, did we not mention
we had news?

29:07.972 --> 29:09.079
-Do they ever?
-No.

29:09.231 --> 29:10.414
What happened, y'all?

29:10.565 --> 29:13.308
Well, uh, I was approached
by some investors.

29:13.401 --> 29:15.419
And now that indoor
dining is back,

29:15.570 --> 29:17.570
they want to re-open
the restaurant.

29:17.664 --> 29:18.905
Ah...

29:18.999 --> 29:20.665
Congratulations.

29:20.760 --> 29:23.093
-That's amazing, y'all.
-Thank you, thank you.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.078
I mean, it's still
a little early.

29:25.097 --> 29:27.080
And there's a lot
to figure out, like, um,

29:27.099 --> 29:28.414
well, who's gonna
watch the girls.

29:28.509 --> 29:30.250
Listen, we are always
down to babysit.

29:30.344 --> 29:31.935
-(inhales sharply)
-Right?

29:32.162 --> 29:33.604
-Don't look like that. Say...
-(laughter)

29:33.755 --> 29:35.773
-yes, we are.
-Yeah, well, you say that now,

29:35.924 --> 29:38.166
<i> chica,</i> but, you know,
very soon you're gonna have

29:38.185 --> 29:39.425
your own little one
to chase around.

29:39.520 --> 29:41.779
Well, I'm just happy
to be off the walker,

29:41.930 --> 29:44.022
so I say bring it on.

29:44.174 --> 29:45.449
Give it to me, I'm ready.

29:45.600 --> 29:48.343
-(laughter)
-Well, listen,
it has been a minute,

29:48.362 --> 29:49.787
but it feels like...

29:49.938 --> 29:51.863
I don't know, it feels like
we're all coming to the end

29:51.957 --> 29:54.016
-of a long, dark tunnel, yeah?
-Yes.

29:54.034 --> 29:56.018
Mm, yeah.

29:56.036 --> 29:58.854
-Well, not-not all of us.
-Mm.

29:59.857 --> 30:03.801
Oh, well, um, yeah,
Judd's been a little worried

30:04.028 --> 30:05.618
about Captain Strand.

30:05.638 --> 30:08.196
TOMMY:
Is this about him
reporting that arson?

30:08.290 --> 30:10.048
'Cause I heard
the AFD investigator

30:10.200 --> 30:11.867
was there
interviewing him today.

30:11.960 --> 30:14.536
So... how'd that go?

30:14.555 --> 30:18.056
Let's just say it-it wasn't
the captain's finest hour.

30:18.208 --> 30:21.393
You think he's chasing ghosts?

30:21.487 --> 30:23.612
Lately, he's been
a little, uh...

30:24.548 --> 30:26.031
...unmoored.

30:28.052 --> 30:29.901
<i> GRACE:</i>
<i> I mean, can you blame him?</i>

30:30.054 --> 30:31.386
<i> I mean, he lost</i>

30:31.405 --> 30:33.813
the love of his life.
And his baby.

30:33.833 --> 30:36.149
<i> JUDD:</i>
<i>And his job, for the time being.</i>

30:36.168 --> 30:38.076
You know, a guy like Owen

30:38.228 --> 30:39.077
really needs that purpose

30:39.171 --> 30:40.562
<i> to drive him,</i>

30:40.581 --> 30:42.397
whether it's real or not.

30:43.342 --> 30:45.676
CLERK:
You, uh, find
everything you need?

30:46.753 --> 30:48.403
We'll see.

30:48.422 --> 30:50.180
<i> GRACE:</i>
<i> And I can relate to him.</i>

30:50.332 --> 30:51.907
Me too.
Being stuck

30:51.925 --> 30:55.168
<i> around the house all the time?</i>
<i> Sometimes you feel like</i>

30:55.262 --> 30:57.003
<i> you're gonna lose your mind.</i>

30:57.097 --> 30:59.005
I just don't want the cap

30:59.024 --> 31:00.749
<i> falling off the deep end.</i>

31:00.842 --> 31:01.841
Mm.

31:01.861 --> 31:03.101
<i> TOMMY:</i>
<i> You know, I don't-don't</i>

31:03.195 --> 31:04.194
think we have to worry

31:04.346 --> 31:06.196
<i> about Captain Strand too much.</i>

31:06.348 --> 31:07.923
<i> One thing we do know</i>

31:08.016 --> 31:09.366
is the man's not crazy.

31:24.532 --> 31:26.124
Alligator char. Only way
to get the scales that shiny

31:26.276 --> 31:28.701
-is accelerant.
-You did use accelerant.

31:28.795 --> 31:30.370
Yeah, yeah,
and it matches exactly

31:30.464 --> 31:32.297
what I saw
in the textile factory.

31:33.467 --> 31:36.059
Remember when you told me
listening to that emergency app

31:36.286 --> 31:38.136
couldn't be good
for my mental health?

31:38.230 --> 31:40.564
I believe
you proved yourself right.

31:40.791 --> 31:42.882
I'm gonna get another beer.

31:44.294 --> 31:47.053
Look, I know this sounds crazy,
but in the past six months,

31:47.072 --> 31:50.148
there have been at least eight
mysterious electrical fires

31:50.300 --> 31:51.316
all over Texas.

31:51.468 --> 31:54.060
There's a warehouse
in Round Rock,

31:54.154 --> 31:57.305
a paper mill in Lubbock,
a feed store in Galveston.

31:57.324 --> 31:59.399
All targets full of fuel.

31:59.493 --> 32:01.643
Each miraculously
started in off-hours

32:01.662 --> 32:04.421
or during a holiday when
there's nobody in the building.

32:05.315 --> 32:06.906
Except for them cleaners
the other night.

32:06.926 --> 32:08.316
Yeah, but they were two hours
late. They weren't supposed

32:08.410 --> 32:09.742
to be there
when the fire started.

32:09.762 --> 32:12.596
Okay, come on. If there was
any meat on this bone,

32:12.747 --> 32:16.383
-don't you think somebody
would have taken a bite already?
-Okay.

32:17.252 --> 32:18.994
If the guy mixed the accelerant

32:19.012 --> 32:21.179
with a diluted substance
like I did,

32:21.331 --> 32:22.606
then the dogs would miss it.

32:22.757 --> 32:26.351
And if he tampered
with the wiring of an appliance,

32:26.503 --> 32:28.503
it could still
be sitting out there.

32:28.596 --> 32:29.929
Nobody'd even notice it.

32:29.949 --> 32:32.674
Okay, but this whole
cock-and-bull theory

32:32.767 --> 32:35.527
depends on that appliance
shorting out, right?

32:35.621 --> 32:37.437
Circuit breakers
in those places--

32:37.531 --> 32:40.348
they'd trip the circuit long
before that could ever happen.

32:40.367 --> 32:43.443
Unless he switched one out

32:43.462 --> 32:45.537
with a counterfeit, like I did.

32:46.707 --> 32:49.191
Here's the circuit breaker,
that's the real one.

32:49.284 --> 32:51.951
That's what it looks like
on the inside.

32:51.971 --> 32:55.255
And this is a counterfeit.

32:56.200 --> 32:57.808
There'd be no way
to stop a surge.

32:58.035 --> 33:00.268
An accident waiting to happen.

33:01.371 --> 33:03.313
All right,
let me ask you something.

33:03.506 --> 33:05.315
Why are you telling me
all this, hmm?

33:05.467 --> 33:08.801
And not Investigator Raymond?

33:08.895 --> 33:10.061
'Cause I don't want him to think
I went around the bend

33:10.214 --> 33:11.488
if I'm wrong.

33:11.681 --> 33:14.474
(chuckles)
God forbid.

33:14.493 --> 33:16.551
You probably
don't want him to take away

33:16.570 --> 33:18.478
your new little pastime,
either, huh?

33:19.481 --> 33:21.573
We just need some proof
before we go.

33:21.667 --> 33:24.334
We?
Oh, it's "we" now, is it?

33:24.561 --> 33:26.169
I'm sorry I assumed
you'd be interested

33:26.396 --> 33:28.588
in catching a serial arsonist.

33:29.416 --> 33:30.565
Look, if any one

33:30.584 --> 33:32.825
of these buildings
has a counterfeit switch

33:32.919 --> 33:35.754
in the circuit breaker,
that's the smoking gun.

33:35.906 --> 33:39.832
And how you propose
<i> we</i> get to them?

33:39.926 --> 33:41.685
How do you think?

33:43.022 --> 33:44.521
Breaking and entering.
Hmm?

33:44.672 --> 33:46.189
The places are abandoned
and burnt out.

33:46.341 --> 33:47.840
It's still private property.

33:47.934 --> 33:49.359
Really?

33:49.511 --> 33:51.611
When did you become
such a choirboy, Billy?

33:54.366 --> 33:58.109
I'm fighting stage III
cancer here.

33:58.262 --> 34:00.111
If we get caught,

34:00.264 --> 34:02.947
I lose my health, pension.

34:03.100 --> 34:05.358
Sorry, New York.

34:05.452 --> 34:08.295
You gonna do this,
you're on your own.

a rage-induced aneurysm

34:30.402 --> 34:32.294
-or something.
-I'm not even angry.

-All right? That's crazy talk.
-Is it?

34:43.582 --> 34:46.399
Because I never miss a chance
to get in the limelight.

34:46.493 --> 34:47.642
There's nothing wrong
with enjoying

34:47.661 --> 34:48.993
a little love from the fans.

34:49.088 --> 34:51.088
Doesn't make you a bad person
or a bad firefighter.

34:51.239 --> 34:52.589
But what if the only reason
I chose this career

34:52.740 --> 34:55.317
was because I knew it'd be
a great way to get attention?

34:55.335 --> 34:56.593
And it has been.

34:56.820 --> 34:59.245
I mean, how else would I be
getting DMs from Cardi B?

34:59.264 --> 35:01.247
You don't get no DMs
from Cardi B.

35:01.266 --> 35:02.799
You get DMs from Cardi B?

35:03.026 --> 35:04.326
Yeah.

35:04.419 --> 35:06.586
Every now and then
for the last couple years.

35:06.605 --> 35:07.604
Okay.

35:07.831 --> 35:10.107
Come on, listen to me.
I am that person.

35:10.334 --> 35:12.517
Let me ask you something.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.519
If you could trade places
with McKenna's husband,

35:14.613 --> 35:17.839
so that you went down
and he lived, would you do it?

35:17.858 --> 35:19.507
In a heartbeat.

35:19.559 --> 35:21.509
That is who you are.

35:21.528 --> 35:23.845
All right? And you respond
to every call the same way

35:23.864 --> 35:26.123
whether there's a camera
around or not.

35:26.274 --> 35:28.941
It just kills me
that with one dumb comment,

35:28.961 --> 35:32.462
I made this nightmare
even worse for McKenna.

35:32.689 --> 35:35.072
I wish I could just explain
to her that in no way

35:35.225 --> 35:37.092
did it pull our focus
from the rescue.

35:38.804 --> 35:40.712
May-Maybe I should.

35:40.806 --> 35:43.515
No.
That is a bad idea, Marjan.

35:44.384 --> 35:47.477
Yep.
You're probably right.

35:57.823 --> 35:58.822
(car door opens, closes)

35:59.049 --> 36:00.574
PAUL:
Yo, Marj.

36:01.476 --> 36:02.975
Wait up.

36:02.995 --> 36:04.477
You followed me here?

36:04.571 --> 36:07.164
Didn't need to.
I knew you'd come here.

36:07.391 --> 36:08.165
How?

36:08.316 --> 36:09.833
Because I know who you are.

36:10.060 --> 36:11.559
Then you know
you're not gonna stop me.

36:11.578 --> 36:13.077
I'm not here to stop you.

36:13.172 --> 36:14.654
I'm here to have your back.

36:14.748 --> 36:18.508
And to be an impartial witness
in case this goes sideways.

36:28.929 --> 36:30.094
(muffled music playing)

36:30.189 --> 36:31.337
(knocking on door)

36:31.356 --> 36:34.566
Uh, McKenna?
Are you in there?

36:38.030 --> 36:40.422
Hey, it's-it's Marjan.

36:40.440 --> 36:44.367
I'd love to talk
if you have a second. Please.

36:44.594 --> 36:46.428
Maybe she's not home?

36:46.446 --> 36:49.039
I can hear music
and her car's here.

36:49.266 --> 36:50.523
(knocking on door)

36:50.542 --> 36:53.952
Listen, I know that I am
the last person in the world

36:54.104 --> 36:55.787
you want to hear from right now,

36:55.939 --> 36:57.789
but I want you to know
that I'm sorry

36:57.883 --> 37:00.275
-for causing you
more pain than...
-Hey, Marj. Hey.

37:00.368 --> 37:02.886
She just posted this,
like, ten minutes ago.

37:03.037 --> 37:05.705
"I'm so sorry you guys,
I'll miss all of you,

37:05.724 --> 37:07.615
but I'll miss Brady more"?

37:07.634 --> 37:09.250
That sounds like goodbye.

37:09.302 --> 37:10.560
Yeah.

37:10.787 --> 37:12.303
-McKenna?
-(knocking on door)

37:12.456 --> 37:13.713
McKenna, are you in there?

37:13.732 --> 37:15.732
We need you to open
the door right now.

37:15.883 --> 37:16.808
McKenna?

37:16.960 --> 37:18.526
Screw it.

37:19.629 --> 37:20.979
-McKenna?
-Hello?

37:21.131 --> 37:22.906
-Are you here? Hello?
-McKenna?

37:23.057 --> 37:24.741
You here?

37:24.892 --> 37:26.317
McKenna?

37:26.470 --> 37:28.486
Oh, no, no, no, no.
McKenna!

37:28.638 --> 37:31.748
Call 911!
McKenna!

37:47.432 --> 37:49.340

37:49.493 --> 37:51.175
-McKenna, can you hear me?
-Marjan, help me

37:51.328 --> 37:52.844
-hold her arms up. Yeah.
-Yeah. Arm up.

37:52.996 --> 37:55.346
Come on, McKenna, open
your eyes. She's not responsive.

37:55.499 --> 37:57.165
<i> JOEL:</i>
<i> Okay, EMS is en route.</i>

37:57.258 --> 37:58.182
Does she still have a pulse?

37:58.335 --> 37:59.501
<i> MARJAN:</i>
<i> Yeah, but it's weak.</i>

37:59.519 --> 38:01.185
We're putting pressure
on the wound,

38:01.338 --> 38:02.353
-but we can't stop the bleeding.
<i> -Okay, I need you</i>

38:02.506 --> 38:03.671
to raise her arms
above her heart.

38:03.690 --> 38:05.282
<i> MARJAN:</i>
<i>Yeah, we're already doing that.</i>

38:05.433 --> 38:06.174
-It's not working.
<i> -Are the cuts</i>

38:06.192 --> 38:08.026
<i> on her wrists horizontal</i>

38:08.178 --> 38:10.011
<i> -or vertical?</i>
-They're vertical. They go
all the way down to her elbow.

38:10.030 --> 38:11.621
Okay, that's, uh,
too much to compress by hand.

38:11.848 --> 38:14.032
<i> Uh, we need to create</i>
<i> a pressure dressing.</i>

38:14.126 --> 38:16.609
<i> -Do you have</i>
<i> any duct tape around?</i>
-No, this isn't our house.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.277
<i> Check the kitchen.</i>
<i> See if there's any</i>

38:18.297 --> 38:19.687
plastic wrap of any kind.

38:19.706 --> 38:21.356
-Okay.
-Yeah, yeah.

38:21.449 --> 38:23.191
(Marjan grunts, shouts)

38:23.284 --> 38:24.375
<i> MARJAN:</i>
<i> McKenna!</i>

38:24.469 --> 38:27.045
We're finishing
the wrapping now.

38:27.197 --> 38:28.363
Bleeding's definitely slowing.

38:28.381 --> 38:30.532
<i> Great work, just keep going.</i>

38:30.550 --> 38:33.393
She's turning blue.
She's not breathing.

38:34.313 --> 38:37.372
No pulse.
Starting compressions.

38:37.423 --> 38:39.649
(grunting)

38:39.801 --> 38:41.568
Pulse check.

38:43.046 --> 38:44.195
(grunts)

38:45.231 --> 38:46.990
-Come on, McKenna.
<i> -All right, EMS</i>

38:47.217 --> 38:48.325
-is arriving
at your location now.
<i> -MARJAN: McKenna!</i>

38:48.476 --> 38:51.386
-(coughs)
-That's it, girl. Come back!

38:51.404 --> 38:54.389
Hey, we got a pulse.
It's weak, but it's there.

38:54.407 --> 38:56.499
PARAMEDIC:
We'll take it from here, guys.

38:57.336 --> 38:59.151
Start a line, run it wide open.

38:59.245 --> 39:01.338
(indistinct radio chatter)

39:09.239 --> 39:10.722
She gonna make it?

39:11.591 --> 39:12.924
Yeah, I think so.

39:13.076 --> 39:14.592
Oh, thank God.

39:14.744 --> 39:16.686
Thank FireFox, more like.

39:17.914 --> 39:19.338
I follow you on Insta.

39:19.432 --> 39:20.415
You'll probably
get an endorsement deal

39:20.433 --> 39:21.841
from the plastic wrap company.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.918
No, I was never here.
You never saw me.

39:23.937 --> 39:26.646
Sure, but the doorbell cam did,
and there's gonna be paperwork.

39:26.756 --> 39:28.439
That's fine.
Just don't post about it, okay?

39:28.592 --> 39:31.092
Nobody else out there
needs to know.

39:31.111 --> 39:32.369
PARAMEDIC:
That's a shame.

39:32.596 --> 39:35.747
Because this was clutch.
You saved her life.

39:38.359 --> 39:40.618
You hear that?
He said you're a lifesaver.

39:40.712 --> 39:44.372
-(engine starts)
-Because that is who you are.

39:45.217 --> 39:48.009
-It's who we are.
-(siren wailing)

39:49.871 --> 39:51.846
<i> (knocking on door)</i>

39:52.707 --> 39:54.516
-Hola.
-ANDREA: Carlitos.

39:55.285 --> 39:57.135
<i> Mi amor.</i>
(laughs)

39:57.229 --> 39:59.229
-Hey, TK.
-GABRIEL: Good to see you, son.

39:59.398 --> 40:01.714
ANDREA:
Ah, you look so handsome.

40:01.733 --> 40:03.382
-(laughs)
-TK: Thank you very much.

40:03.518 --> 40:05.902
-I'm sorry
that we're running behind.
-Oh, nonsense.

40:06.129 --> 40:07.603
We are here early.

40:07.756 --> 40:10.148
His father insisted
on ordering the car 30 minutes

40:10.300 --> 40:12.817
-ahead of time.
-GABRIEL: Well, you never know
about those rideshares.

40:12.911 --> 40:14.302
Sometimes they dawdle.

40:14.395 --> 40:17.229
ANDREA:
Oh, and TK,
I owe you an apology.

40:17.249 --> 40:20.658
That day we met at the market,
I called you TJ.

40:20.810 --> 40:23.327
No, it's-it's okay.
It's, uh, it's an easy mistake.

40:23.480 --> 40:24.570
That our son
should have corrected.

40:24.664 --> 40:26.089
-ANDREA: Mm.
-TK: Oh,

40:26.316 --> 40:28.574
don't worry, Mr. Reyes, we,
we had a conversation about it.

40:28.593 --> 40:31.243
-Didn't we, Carlos?
-Yes, we did.

40:31.337 --> 40:34.079
CARLOS:
So what can we get you to drink?

40:34.099 --> 40:36.415
-I wouldn't say no
to a margarita.
-Ooh.

40:36.435 --> 40:38.676
<i> -¿Dos?</i> Yeah?
-Yes. Yes.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.328
Yes, yes.

40:40.421 --> 40:42.480
-Mrs. Reyes, please.
-(chuckles) Thank you.

40:44.834 --> 40:46.834
Oh, my God.

40:46.853 --> 40:48.111
I forgot about the limes.

40:48.262 --> 40:49.779
How could I forget the limes?

40:49.931 --> 40:51.263
(laughter)

40:51.283 --> 40:53.950
Pull yourself out
of the shame spiral, Carlos.

40:54.177 --> 40:56.327
It's no big deal.

40:58.773 --> 41:00.014
(line ringing)

41:00.033 --> 41:02.016
Dad, are you on your way?

41:02.035 --> 41:05.110
<i> OWEN:</i>
<i> No, no, I have a-an errand</i>
<i>I need to run real quick first.</i>

41:05.130 --> 41:07.038
Could you please
pick up some limes?

41:07.190 --> 41:08.631
<i> Yeah. Sure, I can do that.</i>
<i> Anything else?</i>

41:08.783 --> 41:11.025
Nope, that's it.
Crisis averted.

41:11.118 --> 41:12.877
All right, I'll see you soon.

41:13.029 --> 41:14.471
Okay, son.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.997
(mice squeaking)

41:52.994 --> 41:56.012
Alligator char.

41:58.591 --> 42:00.099
(shutter clicks)

42:24.209 --> 42:27.502
I got you, you son of a bitch.

42:30.440 --> 42:32.382
(shutter clicks)

42:32.533 --> 42:34.092
