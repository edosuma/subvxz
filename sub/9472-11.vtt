This week on "VICE":

00:09.465 --> 00:11.799
Inside Iran's nuclear program.

00:13.769 --> 00:16.289
When they say they're not trying
to build a bomb, they're lying.

00:16.721 --> 00:19.722
Smith: This pool is radioactive,
and your thing is beeping,

00:19.841 --> 00:22.058
so maybe we should... go out.

00:27.769 --> 00:30.850
And then, the street kids of Kolkata.

00:34.523 --> 00:36.523
It's kids running the kids' show.

01:03.301 --> 01:05.552
Since the hostage crisis in 1979,

01:05.637 --> 01:07.720
<i>our relationship with Iran has been</i>

01:07.856 --> 01:10.890
<i>America's most intractable
foreign policy problem.</i>

01:10.976 --> 01:15.228
But last year, Iran and the major world
powers signed a landmark agreement

01:15.313 --> 01:17.230
<i>that eased
years of economic sanctions</i>

01:17.315 --> 01:20.984
<i>in exchange for Iran's abandonment
of its nuclear weapons program.</i>

01:21.069 --> 01:22.619
President Obama:
<i>Under the nuclear deal that</i>

01:22.737 --> 01:25.121
<i>we, our allies and partners,
reached with Iran,</i>

01:25.240 --> 01:28.825
it can begin to receive relief
from certain nuclear sanctions

01:28.910 --> 01:32.495
and gain access to its own
money that had been frozen.

01:32.581 --> 01:33.913
Smith:
<i>Now this deal has been</i>

01:33.999 --> 01:35.439
<i>intensely controversial here at home,</i>

01:35.467 --> 01:37.967
<i>with 47 senators signing a letter</i>

01:38.086 --> 01:40.470
<i>saying they had the right
to rescind the agreement.</i>

01:40.589 --> 01:43.139
I signed that letter.
I stand by it.

01:43.258 --> 01:45.925
Smith: <i>Now that, in turn,
prompted charges of treason</i>

01:46.061 --> 01:47.727
<i>from the president's supporters.</i>

01:47.812 --> 01:50.430
Republicans are undermining
our commander in chief,

01:50.565 --> 01:52.015
while empowering the ayatollahs.

01:52.100 --> 01:54.434
But lost in all the noise
and rhetoric here in the US

01:54.569 --> 01:57.604
is what the Iranians themselves
think of the agreement.

01:57.739 --> 02:00.156
So we went to Tehran to find out.

02:49.207 --> 02:51.040
We're here in Tehran.

02:51.159 --> 02:53.826
And this is the Independence
Day parade.

02:53.912 --> 02:56.162
The president is making a speech,

02:56.247 --> 03:00.383
and we're trying to get there,
but so is the rest of Tehran.

03:00.502 --> 03:02.262
Smith: <i>When we arrived
in Tehran this winter,</i>

03:02.337 --> 03:06.556
<i>the American-led nuclear deal was
just beginning to take effect.</i>

03:06.675 --> 03:08.591
<i>But at this national celebration,</i>

03:08.677 --> 03:11.728
<i>we didn't see many signs
of warming towards the West.</i>

03:11.846 --> 03:15.181
It's the 37th anniversary
of the revolution.

03:15.317 --> 03:17.517
They're trotting out
new missile systems.

03:17.652 --> 03:20.069
There's drone systems over there.

03:20.188 --> 03:23.489
We're gonna see what's happening
here and see what's going on.

03:25.744 --> 03:27.110
People are very excited.

03:27.195 --> 03:29.996
There's a lot of Obama
being burned in effigy,

03:30.081 --> 03:31.664
America being burned in effigy.

03:31.750 --> 03:35.034
And we're here to see how
it's going here in Tehran.

03:41.926 --> 03:45.378
<i>Now the parade was dominated by
the standard anti-American chants</i>

03:45.513 --> 03:46.929
<i>and the burning of effigies.</i>

03:47.048 --> 03:49.716
<i>But when we actually talked to
people in the public square,</i>

03:49.801 --> 03:53.052
<i>their opinions about America
were much more complex.</i>

03:58.309 --> 03:59.392
Smith:
Right.

04:10.405 --> 04:11.454
Right.

04:14.576 --> 04:18.411
Smith: <i>Now distrust of the American
government dates back to 1953,</i>

04:18.495 --> 04:22.965
<i>when the CIA led a coup that overthrew the
democratically elected prime minister</i>

04:23.084 --> 04:26.586
<i>and transferred all power
to Mohammad Reza Pahlavi,</i>

04:26.671 --> 04:28.921
<i>the last shah of Iran.</i>

04:29.007 --> 04:33.342
<i>And for more than two
decades of authoritarian rule,</i>

04:33.428 --> 04:37.180
<i>he governed as America's
proxy in the region.</i>

04:38.817 --> 04:42.268
<i>But in 1979, the shah was overthrown
by the Islamic Revolution</i>

04:42.404 --> 04:45.605
<i>and the Grand Ayatollah
Khomeini rose to power.</i>

04:45.690 --> 04:49.358
Khomeini is my leader, and I
believe in his leadership.

04:50.829 --> 04:53.112
Smith: <i>Now, a firsthand
witness to all of this was</i>

04:53.198 --> 04:54.781
<i>Masoumeh Ebtekar,</i>

04:54.916 --> 04:58.284
<i>an Iranian revolutionary and spokeswoman
for a group of Iranian students</i>

04:58.369 --> 05:04.257
<i>who took more than 50 Americans
hostage at the US embassy in 1979.</i>

05:04.342 --> 05:09.462
The hostages are in our hands,
and we protect them strongly.

05:09.547 --> 05:13.850
And we are ready so that in the
case of any military intervention,

05:13.968 --> 05:15.268
we will destroy them.

05:15.353 --> 05:18.271
Smith: <i>Today, she is part
of Iran's political elite</i>

05:18.356 --> 05:21.441
<i>and acts as one of their
powerful vice presidents.</i>

05:21.526 --> 05:24.477
In America, there are some
skeptics, basically,

05:24.562 --> 05:26.979
in the American government
about the deal.

05:27.065 --> 05:30.450
Are there skeptics in Iran about the deal?
Yes, we have skeptics in Iran.

05:30.535 --> 05:33.486
The long history of the "imperialism"

05:33.621 --> 05:36.405
that Iran experienced
during all those ages,

05:36.491 --> 05:43.546
that has created some people to be
anti-American and not to be so optimistic

05:43.665 --> 05:46.466
about the ultimate
results of this deal.

05:46.551 --> 05:49.418
Smith: <i>Now this deal is a
hallmark of the Obama Doctrine,</i>

05:49.504 --> 05:52.138
<i>which is this president's
initiative to engage with,</i>

05:52.223 --> 05:54.507
<i>rather than isolate
our traditional enemies.</i>

05:54.642 --> 05:56.926
<i>But it's also a profound compromise,</i>

05:57.011 --> 06:00.346
<i>because rather than ending Iran's
nuclear capabilities entirely,</i>

06:00.431 --> 06:02.482
<i>the deal only slows the program down,</i>

06:02.567 --> 06:07.353
<i>and consequently has earned a huge
amount of skepticism here in the US.</i>

06:07.438 --> 06:10.022
<i>Senator Lindsey Graham
was one of the signatures</i>

06:10.108 --> 06:12.575
<i>of the controversial letter
to the ayatollah.</i>

06:12.694 --> 06:15.695
When they say they're not trying
to build a bomb, they're lying.

06:15.830 --> 06:19.749
When they tell us what they're going
to do with it, nobody really knows.

06:19.868 --> 06:22.201
So here's what I would assume:
The worst.

06:22.287 --> 06:25.288
All their behavior
since the agreement,

06:25.373 --> 06:29.542
holding the two American
ships, jailing Americans,

06:29.677 --> 06:32.128
<i>firing missiles in violation
of the UN resolutions.</i>

06:32.213 --> 06:36.048
Here's what the ayatollah and his buddies
are telling us: "You misjudged us."

06:36.134 --> 06:38.017
On the day we voted in the Senate

06:38.102 --> 06:40.219
<i>to basically uphold this agreement,</i>

06:40.355 --> 06:41.387
<i>he tweeted out:</i>

06:41.472 --> 06:43.472
<i>Allah willing within 25 years,</i>

06:43.558 --> 06:45.892
<i>the Zionist regime in Israel
won't exist.</i>

06:46.027 --> 06:49.111
They're basically giving Obama
the diplomatic finger.

06:49.230 --> 06:52.398
<i>Under the agreement, after 15 years</i>

06:52.534 --> 06:55.568
<i>they can reprocess and enrich
without limitation,</i>

06:55.653 --> 06:57.537
<i>so all you've done is buy time.</i>

06:57.622 --> 07:01.958
Under this agreement, they can buy weapons
freely on the open market five years from now.

07:02.076 --> 07:05.328
They can increase their missile
technology eight years from now.

07:05.413 --> 07:07.129
<i>By the end
of a 15-year period,</i>

07:07.248 --> 07:09.415
<i>they have a pathway
to enrichment and reprocessing</i>

07:09.551 --> 07:13.336
that makes them a threshold nation
in terms of a nuclear bomb.

07:13.421 --> 07:17.590
I think overall that deal fell well
short of what I would have liked.

07:17.725 --> 07:19.258
Smith:
<i>Now under this deal,</i>

07:19.344 --> 07:22.595
<i>Iran's nuclear facilities will
be able to produce electricity,</i>

07:22.680 --> 07:25.598
<i>but will, in theory, remain incapable</i>

07:25.683 --> 07:30.436
<i>of generating enough fissionable
material to produce a nuclear weapon.</i>

07:30.521 --> 07:33.022
<i>To see how Iran is responding
to these terms,</i>

07:33.107 --> 07:35.441
<i>we went to the Tehran
Research Reactor,</i>

07:35.577 --> 07:38.578
<i>which is the birthplace
of Iran's nuclear program.</i>

07:38.663 --> 07:43.332
<i>Now, this reactor was actually given to
Iran in the 1960s by the United States</i>

07:43.451 --> 07:47.119
<i>under a program optimistically
named "Atoms for Peace."</i>

07:47.255 --> 07:49.121
<i>To learn more about the program,</i>

07:49.207 --> 07:52.041
<i>we met with the head of Iran's
Atomic Energy Organization,</i>

07:52.126 --> 07:55.127
<i>Vice President Ali Akbar Salehi.</i>

07:55.263 --> 07:58.965
You studied at MIT,
and I believe this reactor...

07:59.100 --> 08:01.384
came from America?
Yes.

08:01.469 --> 08:04.437
I think a lot of Americans
would be surprised about that.

08:04.522 --> 08:06.439
So you have a unique position.

08:06.524 --> 08:09.809
You were foreign minister during
sanctions, now sanctions have been lifted.

08:09.894 --> 08:12.311
One of the reasons why
they were doing the sanctions

08:12.447 --> 08:14.647
is because they wanted to come
to facilities like this.

08:14.782 --> 08:20.036
Why was it such a huge issue that they had
to come and see your nuclear program?

08:20.154 --> 08:24.490
They thought that Iran
was intending to divert

08:24.626 --> 08:27.159
to non-peaceful
nuclear activities.

08:27.295 --> 08:28.494
To make weapons.

08:28.630 --> 08:32.248
To make weapons, yes. Iran
is never interested in this.

08:32.332 --> 08:37.669
Because assuming we had
developed a nuclear weapon,

08:37.755 --> 08:40.006
use it against whom?

08:40.091 --> 08:44.644
We could not get into competition
with the United States,

08:44.729 --> 08:48.347
with Russia. With... You know.
So... It would be suicide.

08:48.483 --> 08:55.521
You could never ever come up and compete
with other leading countries in this regard.

08:55.606 --> 09:00.409
<i>Our supreme leader had issued
a fatwa, which is a decree,</i>

09:00.528 --> 09:05.364
forbidding the production,
accumulation, and any possible use

09:05.500 --> 09:07.950
of weapons of mass destruction.

09:08.036 --> 09:11.537
Why do you think there was
such an acceptance, I guess,

09:11.622 --> 09:13.673
on both sides of
that political story?

09:13.758 --> 09:16.876
I think that pressure
came, essentially,

09:16.961 --> 09:20.796
from the side of America
to see if they can somehow

09:20.882 --> 09:23.215
bring back Iran
to their political orbit.

09:23.351 --> 09:27.436
<i>They came to a very good conclusion
this time to engage with Iran.</i>

09:27.555 --> 09:31.974
<i>The Iranian influence in the
region was increasing day by day,</i>

09:32.060 --> 09:35.978
and the golden key in the Middle
East is in the hand of Iran.

09:36.064 --> 09:39.148
Maybe you could explain a little
bit about what "golden key" means.

09:39.233 --> 09:45.237
Well, when I say golden key, Iran is
situated in a very geo-strategic place.

09:45.323 --> 09:50.659
<i>We are a link between Central Asia,
and through Turkey to Europe.</i>

09:50.745 --> 09:54.580
<i>We are a link between
Russia and Persian Gulf,</i>

09:54.665 --> 09:56.499
<i>which is very
important, in the south.</i>

09:56.584 --> 09:59.919
We are a stable country, we
don't have sectarian problems.

10:00.004 --> 10:04.640
What do you see going forward
in the next few years happening

10:04.759 --> 10:07.176
politically in Iran
and with Iran in the region?

10:07.261 --> 10:10.980
We have to rebuild the trust
and confidence.

10:11.099 --> 10:13.099
You seem very optimistic
about the future,

10:13.184 --> 10:16.485
optimistic about being more
transparent, being more open.

10:16.604 --> 10:21.107
I wonder if we could ask you if we
could see the facility here, today?

10:24.445 --> 10:25.445
Yes, why not?

10:32.370 --> 10:33.370
Okay.

10:33.454 --> 10:35.504
Reactor on? We wanna go in?

10:35.623 --> 10:36.956
Okay.

11:10.291 --> 11:12.625
Smith: <i>When we reached the
actual reactor level,</i>

11:12.710 --> 11:15.711
<i>spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi
gave us an overview.</i>

11:15.830 --> 11:21.834
So, this reactor here was the birthplace
of the Iranian nuclear program?

11:30.344 --> 11:31.427
Smith:
Right.

11:35.933 --> 11:37.266
Your own experts here?

11:37.351 --> 11:39.101
So you can make your own fuel?

11:39.187 --> 11:42.655
Your own uranium?
Within Iran.

11:42.740 --> 11:45.324
Smith: <i>One of the researchers
brought us closer to the pool</i>

11:45.409 --> 11:47.359
<i>to show us how the reactor works.</i>

11:48.996 --> 11:51.447
Smith: And the water's very blue?

11:54.669 --> 11:57.453
So it's radioactive, so we're
going to stand away from it.

11:57.538 --> 11:59.088
I am anyways.

12:04.095 --> 12:06.879
Right. This pool is radioactive,
and your thing is beeping,

12:07.014 --> 12:10.216
so maybe we should go out.

12:10.301 --> 12:14.053
Why do you think that there's
been so much international furor

12:14.188 --> 12:16.722
to come into facilities
like this in Iran?

12:50.758 --> 12:54.009
Smith: <i> Standing next to an active
reactor, Kamalvandi admitted to us</i>

12:54.095 --> 12:57.596
<i>that if Iran can make reactor fuel,
they can also make a weapon,</i>

12:57.682 --> 13:02.234
<i>and that has been the international
community's biggest concern all along.</i>

13:02.320 --> 13:06.021
<i>And according to US Secretary
of Energy Ernest Moniz,</i>

13:06.107 --> 13:08.107
<i>who was a key negotiator on the deal,</i>

13:08.192 --> 13:12.278
<i>Iran was, in fact, close to
being able to produce a bomb.</i>

13:12.413 --> 13:15.080
There are several pathways
to a nuclear weapon.

13:15.166 --> 13:17.032
<i>In Iran, a general thought was</i>

13:17.118 --> 13:20.669
if they chose to move
towards a nuclear weapon,

13:20.788 --> 13:24.957
they could produce the needed materials
in two, perhaps three months.

13:25.042 --> 13:28.427
The accomplishment of the Iran deal

13:28.512 --> 13:31.847
is that they have scaled back
their activities

13:31.966 --> 13:36.018
to a place where even in
a so-called breakout scenario,

13:36.137 --> 13:40.306
it would still be at least a year, more
than enough warning for us to act,

13:40.391 --> 13:43.275
should they decide
to pursue a weapon.

13:43.361 --> 13:45.894
<i>The Iran agreement is
not based on trust.</i>

13:45.980 --> 13:48.364
<i>This agreement is
about no nuclear weapon,</i>

13:48.482 --> 13:51.817
absolutely grounded in verification.

13:51.902 --> 13:54.653
Smith: <i>Now negotiators
insisted on a strong system</i>

13:54.789 --> 13:56.455
<i>for verifying Iran's compliance,</i>

13:56.540 --> 14:00.709
<i>but Iranian nuclear authorities
maintain that this was unnecessary.</i>

14:12.423 --> 14:17.176
Smith: <i>But that ideology
isn't always so clear-cut.</i>

14:17.311 --> 14:20.512
<i>Foad Izadi, a professor of
American Studies in Tehran,</i>

14:20.648 --> 14:22.481
<i>took us to the Imam Khomeini Mosque,</i>

14:22.566 --> 14:27.019
<i>where the spirit of the ayatollah's
anti-American defiance is alive and well.</i>

14:27.104 --> 14:28.937
Is this the largest mosque in Tehran?

14:29.023 --> 14:30.189
Yes.
Yeah.

14:30.324 --> 14:32.524
It's very busy.
Thousands.

14:32.610 --> 14:34.410
Right.
Tens of thousands.

15:12.900 --> 15:16.151
During the prayers,
there was actually a podium,

15:16.237 --> 15:20.289
and in front of the podium it said
against United States. Why is that?

15:26.997 --> 15:28.130
Revolution.

15:36.757 --> 15:39.925
You teach students here
in Tehran about America.

15:40.010 --> 15:41.977
What do young people
think about America?

15:45.599 --> 15:46.682
Smith:
Right.

15:56.444 --> 16:01.196
Socially, politically, and
economically, we're at a big...

16:02.533 --> 16:03.449
Turning point Yes.

16:03.534 --> 16:05.451
Between Iran and America.

16:05.536 --> 16:08.287
And it could go one way,
it could go the other way.

16:09.840 --> 16:11.707
Smith: <i>Now outside
the mosque's walls,</i>

16:11.792 --> 16:14.626
<i>opinions about America
seemed to be positive,</i>

16:14.762 --> 16:17.629
<i>especially among
Tehran's young people.</i>

16:47.161 --> 16:49.211
Smith:
<i>Now, Iran just held elections</i>

16:49.330 --> 16:51.580
<i>in which moderate candidates
made big gains,</i>

16:51.665 --> 16:57.920
<i>building on the election of a more
pro-Western president in 2013.</i>

16:58.005 --> 16:59.671
<i>But in the elections here in America</i>

16:59.757 --> 17:02.090
<i>the rhetoric is turning
much more conservative,</i>

17:02.176 --> 17:04.343
<i>and the Iran deal
is a major flashpoint.</i>

17:04.428 --> 17:07.980
They are laughing at the stupidity of
the deal we are making on nuclear.

17:08.065 --> 17:10.482
We should double up
and triple up the sanctions

17:10.568 --> 17:11.683
and have them come to us.

17:11.819 --> 17:14.319
I would urge the next president
not to honor this deal

17:14.405 --> 17:18.857
and bring these people to their knees as
much as possible before it's too late.

17:21.662 --> 17:27.165
If the next administration wants to
undermine this nuclear deal with Iran,

17:27.251 --> 17:30.869
it would undermine, essentially,
its own credibility.

17:31.005 --> 17:35.207
Then that means you cannot
trust the continuity

17:35.292 --> 17:38.594
of any commitment made by any
administration in the United States.

17:38.712 --> 17:41.763
Smith: <i>But the issue has
now become so politicized,</i>

17:41.882 --> 17:44.216
<i>especially amongst
hardliners on both sides,</i>

17:44.301 --> 17:47.769
<i>that it's clear that
this story is far from over.</i>

17:49.890 --> 17:53.275
Global wealth disparity has reached
record levels in recent years.

17:53.394 --> 17:56.311
<i>Now it's created pockets
of unimaginable affluence,</i>

17:56.397 --> 18:00.482
<i>and huge populations who are falling
farther and farther behind.</i>

18:00.568 --> 18:03.068
<i>Nowhere is this more apparent
than in India,</i>

18:03.204 --> 18:07.956
where the most prominent victims of
poverty and inequality are young people.

18:23.073 --> 18:25.791
Morning, we're on
an express train into Kolkata.

18:25.910 --> 18:28.410
Like most trains, this one's
going to Howrah.

18:28.546 --> 18:30.579
It's the Grand Central of Kolkata.

18:30.664 --> 18:32.548
It's one of the biggest
train stations in India.

18:32.633 --> 18:34.550
Millions of people pass
through it every day,

18:34.635 --> 18:37.135
and thousands of
street kids live there.

18:38.889 --> 18:40.505
Morton:
<i>India's got a lot of people,</i>

18:40.591 --> 18:42.975
<i>some 1.26 Billion
at last count.</i>

18:43.093 --> 18:46.728
<i>Kolkata's railroads not only service the
entire eastern half of the country,</i>

18:46.814 --> 18:50.098
<i>they connect India's railways with all
the South Asian countries to its east:</i>

18:50.234 --> 18:52.651
<i>Bangladesh, Burma, Cambodia, China,</i>

18:52.770 --> 18:55.771
<i>none of which are doing too shabby
in the population department.</i>

19:10.921 --> 19:14.423
<i>On the periphery of all the commuters
and porters and other train personnel</i>

19:14.508 --> 19:17.626
<i>are Howrah's only permanent
residents, the platform kids.</i>

19:17.761 --> 19:21.129
<i>They wait for each train to disgorge
its passengers, then scramble on board</i>

19:21.265 --> 19:24.065
<i>to collect all the the water bottles
and other recyclables left behind,</i>

19:24.134 --> 19:26.718
<i>which you'd think would be
viewed as a valued service,</i>

19:26.804 --> 19:28.270
<i>though this is not often the case.</i>

19:37.064 --> 19:39.364
They're basically living in
this weird little blind spot

19:39.483 --> 19:41.984
created by India's
massive population.

19:42.069 --> 19:44.152
Right? Pretty much.

19:49.326 --> 19:50.326
Oww!

19:52.129 --> 19:53.495
<i>Despite us being
out-of-towners,</i>

19:53.580 --> 19:55.163
<i>one of the Howrah boys
took us under his wing,</i>

19:55.299 --> 19:58.050
<i>and introduced us to his
friends at platform 17,</i>

19:58.168 --> 20:01.420
<i>just one of the many gangs
of kids around the station.</i>

20:04.642 --> 20:07.009
Those are some little lost boys.

20:07.094 --> 20:08.176
How are you doing, man?

20:08.312 --> 20:09.978
<i>While living on the tracks is
how we usually refer</i>

20:10.064 --> 20:12.014
<i>to the lowest level
of human existence,</i>

20:12.099 --> 20:14.516
<i>the Howrah kids we saw seemed
to be enjoying themselves</i>

20:14.601 --> 20:18.186
<i>in a lawless, parentless sense of
freedom they enjoy at the station.</i>

20:19.940 --> 20:22.407
That's a good stream he's got going.

20:22.526 --> 20:25.527
It's kids running the kids' show.

20:25.663 --> 20:28.914
<i>Howrah's street children may seem
like a form of vestigial poverty,</i>

20:29.033 --> 20:31.199
<i>a remnant of old India
that will be swept away</i>

20:31.335 --> 20:34.202
<i>by the country's growing economy
and influx of new money,</i>

20:34.288 --> 20:36.371
<i>but, in fact, according
to Professor Mazumdar</i>

20:36.457 --> 20:37.923
<i>of the Jayaprakash Institute,</i>

20:38.042 --> 20:40.926
<i>the children at the train station
are a modern phenomenon.</i>

21:05.319 --> 21:07.799
Morton: <i>While a lot of the Howrah
kids are runaways or orphans,</i>

21:07.905 --> 21:09.654
<i>some are still in touch
with their families.</i>

21:09.740 --> 21:12.624
<i>Some of them even
live right by the station.</i>

21:12.743 --> 21:14.659
So, this little guy, Jan Mohammed,

21:14.745 --> 21:16.378
his mom actually lives near here.

21:16.463 --> 21:19.414
The problem is she works all day,
so she can't look after him.

21:20.667 --> 21:21.583
Exactly.

21:23.003 --> 21:25.754
<i>Jan Mohammed's mom was waiting
for him at his family home,</i>

21:25.889 --> 21:27.723
<i>which was built
under a highway overpass.</i>

21:27.808 --> 21:28.924
Are these all yours?

21:30.844 --> 21:31.844
Okay.

21:31.929 --> 21:34.763
And one more. Oh, she's
the oldest one. Okay.

21:44.358 --> 21:46.942
Can we see where you live?

21:48.078 --> 21:49.578
Okay, so this is home.

21:49.663 --> 21:52.114
This explains things
a little bit more.

21:52.199 --> 21:55.083
This is not a spot. This is
basically homeless living.

21:55.169 --> 21:58.537
So it's not entirely surprising
Jan Mohammed would opt

21:58.622 --> 22:01.957
for a slightly more fun,
at least for a kid,

22:02.092 --> 22:05.127
form of homeless living
over at the station.

22:07.014 --> 22:08.930
So the whole thing with Howrah,
we look at it and we see

22:09.016 --> 22:11.299
a train station that's
dirty and like, dangerous,

22:11.385 --> 22:13.935
but if you look at the rest
of this neighborhood,

22:14.021 --> 22:16.972
Howrah's actually kind
of clean and safe.

22:17.057 --> 22:20.859
<i>Even without parents, the Howrah kids
still have daily responsibilities.</i>

22:20.978 --> 22:25.697
Is this today's... just from one
train, or from the whole day?

22:46.670 --> 22:48.670
Morton: <i>The bottle game is
big money around Howrah.</i>

22:48.755 --> 22:50.639
<i>It's basically
it's own micro economy,</i>

22:50.724 --> 22:53.225
<i>with the gangs working as
little recycling cooperatives,</i>

22:53.343 --> 22:54.810
<i>and a network of collection centers</i>

22:54.895 --> 22:57.095
<i>located right off the tracks
for them to sell to.</i>

22:58.265 --> 22:59.981
So, that's the transaction.

23:00.067 --> 23:04.102
Bottles have been dropped off, money
has changed hands, and we head back.

23:04.188 --> 23:06.104
They have to do it again and again.

23:06.190 --> 23:07.072
Hello.

23:15.365 --> 23:16.498
Got it.

23:16.583 --> 23:19.251
<i>Between bottle recycling
and basic panhandling,</i>

23:19.369 --> 23:21.369
<i>platform kids can make enough
scratch in one day</i>

23:21.505 --> 23:23.455
<i>to keep them and their
fellow gang members fed.</i>

23:23.540 --> 23:26.374
<i>Unfortunately the first thing most
Howrah kids spend their money on</i>

23:26.510 --> 23:28.343
<i>is give to get high off of,</i>

23:28.428 --> 23:31.213
<i>which is available for cheap at
newsstands around the station.</i>

23:31.298 --> 23:33.682
<i>The platform kid brand
of choice is Dendrite,</i>

23:33.767 --> 23:35.383
<i>which costs
a little less than a quarter.</i>

23:35.469 --> 23:37.385
<i>If there's any money left
after buying give,</i>

23:37.521 --> 23:41.473
<i>it gets spent as it does by high
teenagers anywhere, at the movies.</i>

23:41.558 --> 23:43.308
Uh, one balcony.

23:45.028 --> 23:46.528
Oh, lot of kids.

23:46.613 --> 23:47.729
Hey, guys.

23:47.865 --> 23:49.731
<i>The platform kids are such
regulars at this theater</i>

23:49.867 --> 23:52.484
<i>that the owners change the
movie daily, just for them,</i>

23:52.569 --> 23:55.320
<i>and let them huff Dendrite the
whole time they're in there.</i>

24:04.665 --> 24:07.249
<i>It's like the Cinematheque
Francaise meets the rowdiest,</i>

24:07.334 --> 24:10.252
<i>least-supervised birthday
party you've ever been to.</i>

24:15.592 --> 24:18.510
<i>After the movies, the kids head
back to Howrah to sleep...</i>

24:20.264 --> 24:23.348
<i>where the atmosphere is a lot darker
than it is during the daytime.</i>

24:29.273 --> 24:31.773
It is spooky out here.

24:31.858 --> 24:34.859
This is not where I'd want
to be hanging out.

24:34.945 --> 24:37.112
There's a rag in their mouth.

24:42.786 --> 24:43.835
Ready to sleep.

24:47.791 --> 24:49.624
I'm good.

24:49.760 --> 24:50.760
Good.

24:50.844 --> 24:53.345
<i>The give sniffing
continues until shuteye.</i>

24:53.463 --> 24:55.046
<i>Actually, a lot of the kids sleep</i>

24:55.132 --> 24:57.492
<i>with their give rags stuffed in
their mouths like pacifiers,</i>

24:57.601 --> 24:59.467
<i>which in a sad way, they kind of are.</i>

24:59.553 --> 25:02.020
<i>At this point, the give is
less a recreational drug</i>

25:02.139 --> 25:04.639
<i>than a necessary anesthetic
for their environment.</i>

25:04.775 --> 25:06.808
<i>Mohammed Sohail is 12 years old.</i>

25:06.893 --> 25:08.643
<i>He's been living in Howrah
for the last two years,</i>

25:08.779 --> 25:10.729
<i>and uses give every night
to get to sleep.</i>

25:27.297 --> 25:28.537
What do you want to happen then?

25:28.582 --> 25:30.415
Like, what do you want to do?

25:39.009 --> 25:41.009
You kids are...

25:41.094 --> 25:42.677
You kids are a mess.

25:45.015 --> 25:46.348
What's going on?

25:46.483 --> 25:47.849
How you guys doing?

25:49.319 --> 25:50.402
All right.

26:02.833 --> 26:05.700
<i>The next morning, everybody wakes up,
wipes the give from their mouths</i>

26:05.836 --> 26:07.396
<i>and starts the whole
process over again.</i>

26:10.123 --> 26:13.341
<i>One thing we started to notice was
there weren't just no adults around,</i>

26:13.427 --> 26:15.927
<i>there didn't seem to be
any older street kids.</i>

26:16.046 --> 26:18.463
<i>It's weird considering you have
hundreds of children on the tracks,</i>

26:18.548 --> 26:21.966
<i>you really don't see anyone
over the age of 14 or 15.</i>

26:25.722 --> 26:28.723
<i>Vishu Viswanath helps run this
drop-in center by the station,</i>

26:28.809 --> 26:31.090
<i>where platform kids can come
get off the tracks for a bit,</i>

26:31.144 --> 26:33.895
<i>eat some food and catch up
on their cartoons.</i>

26:34.031 --> 26:37.482
<i>He's one of the few authority figures the
street kids regularly interact with,</i>

26:37.567 --> 26:40.985
<i>and one of the only grown-ups
they all seem to trust.</i>

26:41.071 --> 26:43.071
Morton: Oh, you have a nice shiner.

26:47.077 --> 26:48.460
A policeman did that?

27:03.060 --> 27:05.927
How badly beaten? Is it
just like slaps and...

27:07.431 --> 27:08.730
No?

27:08.815 --> 27:10.982
Like those big batons they carry?

27:21.278 --> 27:24.028
Morton: <i> Since Howrah's not only
an awful place for kids to live,</i>

27:24.114 --> 27:27.031
<i>but may also be grooming them
for an adult life of crime,</i>

27:27.117 --> 27:29.717
<i>we met with the State Commission
For the Protection of Child Rights</i>

27:29.753 --> 27:33.037
<i>to see what the government in Kolkata
is doing about the situation.</i>

27:48.772 --> 27:50.355
How long do you
estimate it will take?

28:14.664 --> 28:18.166
Morton: <i>So the government's official
plan is to wait for 50 years</i>

28:18.251 --> 28:21.336
<i>and see if adding more people to the
city somehow solves the problem.</i>

28:21.471 --> 28:25.473
<i>Meanwhile, as Kolkata waits for half
a century to see how this turns out,</i>

28:25.559 --> 28:29.761
<i>mass urbanization isn't a local
issue, or even an Indian one.</i>

28:29.846 --> 28:32.564
<i>According to the United
Nations, in the next 15 years,</i>

28:32.682 --> 28:37.185
<i>60% of the entire planet will live in
crowded urban areas just like Kolkata.</i>

28:37.320 --> 28:39.521
<i>And as the widening gap
between rich and poor</i>

28:39.656 --> 28:43.775
<i>forces these new city dwellers to work
even longer and harder to make ends meet,</i>

28:43.860 --> 28:46.411
<i>packs of uncared for children
like the scene at Howrah</i>

28:46.530 --> 28:49.864
<i>may become a permanent feature of
the urban landscape worldwide.</i>
