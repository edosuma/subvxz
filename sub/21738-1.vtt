03:02.975 --> 03:05.186
We've got a little fire left.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.063
(Soldier) I'm about done.

03:07.188 --> 03:09.607
A little lead?
A little powder.

03:11.984 --> 03:13.820

07:12.141 --> 07:14.477
'But the hatred was patient.'

07:52.306 --> 07:54.308
It's quite an introduction.

07:57.269 --> 07:59.105
Let's start over.

08:00.523 --> 08:04.026
In this territory,
I'm the judge, the jury,

08:04.151 --> 08:06.195
and unfortunately the punisher.

08:06.988 --> 08:09.198
My job is to sift through chaos.

08:10.074 --> 08:13.577
And we have a lot of chaos
to sift through.

08:13.703 --> 08:16.122
You, my little friend, have got to help me
come to an understanding

08:16.247 --> 08:18.082
of what all this...

08:23.379 --> 08:25.715
I have a granddaughter.

08:25.840 --> 08:28.426
She's just a little younger
than you are.

08:29.218 --> 08:32.554
She also has a keen mind.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.683
Her imagination
is a glory to behold.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.687
And I see that you, too,
are gifted with fiction.

08:41.147 --> 08:44.567
But my granddaughter
doesn't sow death wherever she goes.

08:46.235 --> 08:51.657
Now, being white and Christian
goes a long way in my courtroom.

08:51.782 --> 08:55.286
And I have a special affinity
for the female persuasion.

08:56.412 --> 08:59.915
Now, I want you to continue.

09:00.041 --> 09:04.462
But choose your words carefully,
because I'm the only hope you have.

09:08.299 --> 09:11.802
Before your men
discovered our home,

09:11.927 --> 09:13.971
they had been lost for days.

09:16.098 --> 09:19.727
They sent a man to ask us
for food and supplies,

09:20.478 --> 09:22.688
and we gave what we could.

09:23.439 --> 09:25.274
But they weren't satisfied.

09:28.360 --> 09:31.322
'When strong men
face catastrophe,

09:31.447 --> 09:33.282
'they band together.

for survival.

09:37.870 --> 09:39.830

09:41.040 --> 09:43.084
This is all they could spare.

Potatoes.

09:49.131 --> 09:51.467
'Some of them had a plan.

No.

10:10.402 --> 10:12.822

10:25.918 --> 10:27.461
(Soldier) I'll be back
for every one of you.

10:28.212 --> 10:30.631
I'll drag you all to hell.

10:36.053 --> 10:39.140
(Choking and gurgling)

11:07.001 --> 11:09.086
'And then they came
for my family.

there is a devil.

had been so blood drunk

three days from here.

19:05.854 --> 19:07.105
Well, take us.

19:09.900 --> 19:10.984
I'll need a gun.

but a chair.

For the price of another man's life,
he got his gun.

But they didn't kill him.

19:27.501 --> 19:29.419
He was beaten.

His gun was taken.

He was left to starve,
or freeze.

There is no mercy, no honor.

19:49.898 --> 19:54.444
He was just left broken

what happened then?

'What the wicked fears
will come upon you.

41:54.555 --> 41:58.142
'What the wicked fears
will come upon you.

41:59.768 --> 42:03.355
'What the wicked fears
will come upon you.'

42:29.965 --> 42:34.845
'Thus I punish the world
for its evil.'

42:34.970 --> 42:37.473
(indistinct whispering)

44:00.013 --> 44:04.560
'There is no man that hath power
over the breath of life.

44:04.685 --> 44:08.105
'Neither hath the power
over the day of death.

44:09.356 --> 44:12.484
'As there is no discharge
in the day of battle...

44:14.361 --> 44:20.534
'...neither shall wickedness deliver
those that are given to it.'

44:20.659 --> 44:23.579
(Gagging)

44:41.180 --> 44:46.643
'Thus I will punish the world for its evil,
and the wicked for their iniquity.'

45:10.125 --> 45:13.378
(Girl) And now you're wondering
about your brother.

45:15.631 --> 45:16.882
Where is he?

45:17.633 --> 45:19.551
Would you like to see him?

45:22.554 --> 45:23.597
Yes.

45:45.744 --> 45:47.329
(Judge) Get the rope.

46:26.576 --> 46:28.495
Is this really true
what you're saying,

46:29.538 --> 46:34.376
or... was it the Blackfoot?

46:34.501 --> 46:35.752
They did this, right?

46:36.837 --> 46:39.756
You didn't really pray someone
back from the dead, did you?

46:47.222 --> 46:50.726
Show me what he saw
when you touched him.

47:10.412 --> 47:11.580
(Gunshot)

47:16.710 --> 47:18.211
What was that?

47:19.254 --> 47:20.422
Hatred.

47:21.590 --> 47:25.177
(Footsteps approaching)

47:32.642 --> 47:33.643
What is this?

47:34.644 --> 47:36.229
The devil's eyes.

47:38.273 --> 47:40.609
How one dies
in the devil's eyes...

47:42.444 --> 47:45.614
...is how one returns,
says the undead.

47:45.739 --> 47:48.700
(Footsteps approaching)

47:48.825 --> 47:51.203
All deviltry is paid.

48:15.477 --> 48:19.731
I'm running out of patience
and you're running out of time.

48:20.565 --> 48:23.568
Allow me to finish
with the past...

48:25.153 --> 48:27.489
...so the future
will come as it will.

48:29.241 --> 48:35.080
Your brother was a gutless coward,
and that's how he'll roam.

48:39.167 --> 48:43.171
'Hell is the reward
of realized vengeance.

48:43.296 --> 48:47.717
'With the deed done,
purpose slips away.

48:49.010 --> 48:54.850
'Most of us are lucky enough
to die and rot away to nothingness.

48:55.851 --> 48:58.603
'But those who die
behind the devil's eyes

48:58.728 --> 49:01.565
'are granted no such love.

49:01.690 --> 49:03.692
'They may rot,

49:03.817 --> 49:07.904
'but they never escape
the devil's consciousness.

49:08.029 --> 49:11.450
'They drift forever
in their final thought.

49:11.575 --> 49:14.870
'An unbreakable circle.

49:15.537 --> 49:19.458
'Your brother's last moment
was filled with terror.'

49:20.167 --> 49:21.168
(Gunshot)

49:48.612 --> 49:50.113
(Gun clicks)

50:42.916 --> 50:44.876
Hello, hello.

50:49.673 --> 50:51.841
(indistinct)

51:22.956 --> 51:24.416
(Gunshot)

51:31.006 --> 51:33.008
(Gun clicks)

51:54.779 --> 51:59.326
'Forebode, the Lord is about
to come out of this place

51:59.451 --> 52:02.412
'to punish thee
for the evils of the Earth.'

52:02.537 --> 52:04.372
(indistinct praying)

52:08.501 --> 52:11.254
Oh... please.

52:12.714 --> 52:17.469
(Groaning and screaming)

52:31.066 --> 52:37.489
'Execute judgment by fire
and by its sword on all flesh.

52:37.614 --> 52:41.868
'And those slain by the Lord
will be many.

52:42.702 --> 52:47.207
'Do not marvel at this
for an hour is coming

52:47.332 --> 52:48.833
'in which all who...

52:48.958 --> 52:51.795
(indistinct praying)

52:51.920 --> 52:54.673

52:54.798 --> 52:59.594
'Those who did the good deeds
to resurrection of life,

52:59.719 --> 53:04.599
'those who committed the evil deeds
to resurrection ofjudgement.'

(indistinct)

53:09.229 --> 53:11.898
(indistinct)

53:16.236 --> 53:18.071
Get the pipes.

53:28.456 --> 53:30.333
You haven't been helpful.

53:32.585 --> 53:37.799
You haven't helped me,
and you haven't helped yourself.

53:37.924 --> 53:43.263
I love the story, but this
isn't the time for stories.

53:45.640 --> 53:47.600
It's time for you to hang.

53:52.814 --> 53:54.566
Rope her up.

54:01.990 --> 54:06.077
Sir, if I may, maybe we should
put the mask on her.

54:19.132 --> 54:24.137
(r Bagpipes)

56:59.375 --> 57:03.963
(indistinct whispering)

57:44.170 --> 57:47.340
'A pit is dug for the wicked.

(Distorted) 'A pit is dug for the wicked.'
