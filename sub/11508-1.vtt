01:24.959 --> 01:28.837
World War III, hot and cold,
lasted from...

01:29.130 --> 01:30.631
Hold.

01:32.175 --> 01:33.509
Female.

01:33.802 --> 01:36.887
Rover pack has her, 125 yards.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.932
Solo, waiting to move in, 75 yards.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.026
No!

01:57.992 --> 02:00.160
Keep away from me!

02:06.835 --> 02:08.335
Help!

02:09.419 --> 02:11.922
Maniacs! Stop it!

02:13.758 --> 02:15.509
Help! No!

02:17.011 --> 02:19.179
No!

02:24.519 --> 02:25.936
- Say it again!
- No!

02:26.229 --> 02:28.147
Say that again, you bitch!

02:34.362 --> 02:36.572
Hey, did you see her jerk
when I cut her?

02:36.865 --> 02:38.907
Hold, one more.

02:56.259 --> 02:57.968
You're still constantly overreacting.

02:58.261 --> 03:01.889
I've absolutely no idea how I've
managed to keep you alive so long.

03:07.061 --> 03:10.397
I wouldn't bother going down in there,
unless your taste has changed radically.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.107
They left an ugly mess.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.943
- I said they left a mess!
- I heard you.

03:15.236 --> 03:16.778
Pearls before swine.

03:17.071 --> 03:18.989
All my directives
go completely unregarded.

03:20.158 --> 03:22.159
Sometimes you're just as ignorant
as any other common rover.

03:22.452 --> 03:25.746
One indication of a female alone
and it's caution to the wind,

03:26.039 --> 03:28.749
the eyes glaze, the glands swell,
and the brain freezes.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.251
I can't see a thing in there.
Smell it!

03:31.544 --> 03:33.921
I thought you were doing all
the scouting today, Vic.

03:34.214 --> 03:37.299
Damn it Blood, don't give me
a hard time, smell it!

03:39.093 --> 03:40.427
It's clean.

04:25.014 --> 04:26.640
Ain't that a shame.

04:27.850 --> 04:29.685
Hell, they didn't have to cut her.

04:29.978 --> 04:32.354
She could have been used
three or more times.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.106
War is hell.

04:36.734 --> 04:38.527
All right. Run it again.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.196
You're so funny when
you're sexually frustrated.

04:41.489 --> 04:43.249
I'm funny enough to kick you
upside the butt!

04:43.491 --> 04:45.117
I said find, and I ain't kidding.

04:45.410 --> 04:48.453
One does not say ain't, Albert.
Simply say I'm not kidding.

04:48.746 --> 04:51.707
Fine, dog meat.
And stop calling me Albert.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.752
And you would stone a poor
defenseless animal, wouldn't you?

04:57.213 --> 05:00.090
Yes, I can tell that would.
I can tell by your short breath

05:00.383 --> 05:03.677
and your disgusting aggressive
behavior that you would.

05:05.555 --> 05:08.098
And that's because you're
not a nice person, Albert.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.267
You're not a nice person at all.

05:28.619 --> 05:30.954
Do I gawk at you when you're working?

05:32.582 --> 05:34.082
I'll locate a female if there is one.

05:34.375 --> 05:36.168
You go look for food.

06:20.922 --> 06:23.799
I detect no living female person
within my range, sir.

06:24.092 --> 06:27.052
I have sniffed and I have cast
and I have a negative reading.

06:27.345 --> 06:29.846
However I'd be delighted
to tell you a suggestive story,

06:30.139 --> 06:31.848
if you think that would help.

06:32.141 --> 06:34.351
Pass, fuzzy-butt.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.353
A cautious young fella
named Lodge

06:36.646 --> 06:39.689
had seatbelts
installed in his Dodge.

06:39.982 --> 06:41.608
When his date was strapped in,

06:41.901 --> 06:44.528
he committed a sin
without even leaving the garage.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.238
That's clever, isn't it?

06:57.834 --> 07:03.255
Let's see, from March 1953
to June...

07:03.548 --> 07:06.550
Albert, you have all the cranial
capacity of a canary.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.385
Now, I'm going to recount
these events

07:08.678 --> 07:10.198
of historical significance once again.

07:10.346 --> 07:13.515
Now, please, please try
to assimilate them this time.

07:16.352 --> 07:17.894
World War III, hot and cold,

07:18.187 --> 07:21.565
lasted from June 1950 to March 1983,

07:21.858 --> 07:24.901
when the Vatican armistice was signed
between the Eastern and Western blocs,

07:25.194 --> 07:27.904
a total of 33 years.

07:28.197 --> 07:29.906
Is this too fast for you?

07:30.199 --> 07:33.368
- No, I'm right with you.
- Oh, good.

07:37.707 --> 07:41.251
Now World War IV lasted five days,

07:41.544 --> 07:45.922
just long enough for the final missiles
to leave their silos on both sides.

07:46.215 --> 07:50.969
What's left here where once were
homes and families with warm hearths...

07:51.262 --> 07:55.056
Come on, teats! Would you get
off my back, you mad dog?

07:56.809 --> 07:59.102
Now only desolation,

07:59.395 --> 08:02.814
civilization lies smothered
and decaying under an ocean of mud,

08:03.107 --> 08:05.609
belonging to anyone who's
strong enough

08:05.902 --> 08:08.445
to dig and fight
and take it for his own.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.614
God, that's dramatic, I like that.

08:10.907 --> 08:14.159
So, spread about us,
the city of Phoenix, Arizona,

08:14.452 --> 08:17.412
where in 2006, 18-odd years ago,
you managed

08:17.705 --> 08:19.585
to come into the world
and we became associates.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.500
Now, let's hear that back.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.333
Now let's run through
the modern presidents.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.491
What good's all this history crap
gonna do me?

08:54.784 --> 08:56.326
Just do the Presidents.

08:56.619 --> 08:58.203
Oh, God.

08:59.288 --> 09:01.581
- Eisenhower, Truman...
- Truman, Eisenhower.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.667
Truman, Eisenhower...

09:03.960 --> 09:06.503
Kennedy... Johnson...

09:06.796 --> 09:10.173
Nixon... Ford...

09:10.466 --> 09:14.511
Kennedy... Kennedy... Kennedy...

09:28.943 --> 09:32.028
Your continued narrow-minded refusal
to believe in Over The Hill

09:32.321 --> 09:34.197
is possibly costing us
a better life, you know.

09:34.490 --> 09:35.532
Over The Hill, my ass.

09:35.825 --> 09:38.201
Well, when do we start
looking for it again?

09:41.330 --> 09:43.206
- Soon as I get my heart started.
- I mean let's stop the crap.

09:43.499 --> 09:46.084
I know what you mean: Over the Hill,
where the deer and the antelope play

09:46.377 --> 09:49.087
and it's warm and clean
and we can relax and have fun.

09:49.380 --> 09:52.132
Man, they grow food
right out of the ground.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.718
- How do like that pipe dream?
- It's called farming.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.094
Oh, I believe you.

09:56.387 --> 10:00.056
And they also have a great crop of
clothes and guns and gorgeous chicks.

10:00.349 --> 10:01.725
You're gonna tell me how you saw

10:02.018 --> 10:03.859
the whole wonderful thing
with your baby blues.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.228
Never said I saw it,
I said I heard about it.

10:05.521 --> 10:06.563
And from who?

10:06.856 --> 10:08.523
From whom,
and you know from whom.

10:09.942 --> 10:12.736
And whom the hell's
gonna believe a police dog?

10:21.537 --> 10:23.038
I'm sorry, Blood.

10:23.331 --> 10:26.750
I believe you about Over the Hill.
Hell, I believe anything you tell me.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.878
And even if we don't know for sure,
it's worth checking on, right?

10:31.339 --> 10:33.548
- Right?
- Whatever you say.

10:33.841 --> 10:36.593
And we will go, just like I promised.

10:36.886 --> 10:39.262
Right now I'm hungry
and I wanna get laid.

10:39.555 --> 10:42.057
So find me a broad, and we'll go
to the promised land.

10:42.350 --> 10:43.642
That's what you always say.

10:43.934 --> 10:46.269
I know, I know, but I mean it this time.

10:46.562 --> 10:47.979
Find me a chick and we'll go.

10:48.272 --> 10:49.356
I'm hungry.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.274
So am I!

10:51.567 --> 10:54.486
I tell you what. You go find a chick,
and I'll hustle us up some food.

10:54.779 --> 10:55.820
I'm hungry.

10:56.113 --> 10:57.447
You already said that,
god damn it, and I just said...

10:57.740 --> 10:59.741
I can't do good work when I'm hungry.

11:00.034 --> 11:02.077
You ain't pulling that crap on me again!

11:02.370 --> 11:04.651
And you can shove that part
about how you lost the ability

11:04.747 --> 11:07.082
to hunt for food
when you learned how to talk!

11:07.375 --> 11:09.959
Oh, hell, all you're good for
is finding hard, stringy scumbags

11:10.252 --> 11:12.012
that are just liable
to cut off my goddamn...

11:12.088 --> 11:14.297
No food, no females.

11:14.590 --> 11:16.310
Okay, you just sit there
on your fluffy butt

11:16.592 --> 11:18.301
while I do all the goddamn work!

11:18.594 --> 11:21.471
But I'll tell you one goddamn thing,
you better do some practicing.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.306
It's been six weeks since I been laid,

11:23.599 --> 11:26.226
and it sure as hell ain't been
that long since you ate.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.688
By God, it damn well may be
if you don't start producing.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.213
Here, right! Here, right!

11:58.592 --> 12:01.720
Heave! Heave away!

12:02.012 --> 12:03.930
Pull! Pull!

12:04.223 --> 12:07.600
Hey, there, pull on that line!
Pull on it, there!

12:17.445 --> 12:19.821
Get out there! Dig!

12:21.365 --> 12:23.825
Dig, you suckers!
Get that dirt outta there.

12:25.119 --> 12:29.414
Must be something special.
They got the whole bunch.

12:29.707 --> 12:33.376
You get up and get in that hole.
Get up!

12:35.171 --> 12:41.176
You get yourself up,
or you ain't never gonna get up!

12:42.052 --> 12:43.887
How'd Fellini know
there'd be a house here?

12:44.180 --> 12:46.014
'Cause he's smarter, that's how!

12:51.020 --> 12:53.396
Wonder why they hang around him?

12:53.689 --> 12:56.941
Probably just charisma.

12:57.234 --> 12:58.693
Hey, there!

13:03.741 --> 13:05.408
You dig.

13:10.873 --> 13:12.624
Move your foot if you don't want any...!

13:12.917 --> 13:14.834
Hey, watch were you throw that crap!

13:18.214 --> 13:19.547
Dig!

13:27.723 --> 13:29.140
Hey!

13:31.060 --> 13:33.895
Play!

13:41.904 --> 13:44.239
Play "Melancholy Baby"!

14:31.412 --> 14:33.329
God, I wish he'd tune that.

14:35.791 --> 14:37.333
Well?

14:37.626 --> 14:40.837
I don't know. Checked out
Cracker Jack to here.

14:41.130 --> 14:43.006
Think he just might do.

14:43.299 --> 14:44.465
Maybe.

14:49.138 --> 14:51.806
- Get that out of there.
- Look at that!

14:53.976 --> 14:56.144
Keep your hands off of that.
Now get away from there.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.986
Look at all that food.

15:05.279 --> 15:08.281
- I'll knock your stupid head in.
- You and who else?

15:08.574 --> 15:10.533
Just me!

15:10.826 --> 15:11.993
Boy!

15:13.662 --> 15:16.539
I need shoes!
Anybody see some shoes?

15:19.501 --> 15:22.712
Dig! Dig, you pigs!
Get down in there and dig.

15:23.005 --> 15:25.006
This place ought to be loaded.
Get it out of there.

15:26.842 --> 15:28.051
Might work.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.428
We'll wait like we always do.

15:31.513 --> 15:33.723
To hell with waiting.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.683
Vic, come back here!

15:38.687 --> 15:40.563
Get away from here!

15:40.856 --> 15:42.857
Help! He's takin' our bag!

15:44.526 --> 15:47.111
Help, help, help, help!

15:59.667 --> 16:03.294
Get back down in here,
you idiots, get back in here.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.339
- Leave him go.
- We got him, didn't we, Blood?

16:06.632 --> 16:08.424
Oh, shut up and keep running!

16:08.717 --> 16:11.302
At least he's got some guts.
Now, dig in there!

16:11.595 --> 16:13.429
Get out of there
and guard that wagon.

16:15.099 --> 16:18.184
- Now watch him take it out on us!
- Run, boy!

16:18.477 --> 16:21.104
Come back any time, though.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.318
Dig, you suckers!

16:36.412 --> 16:40.248
That's our boy.
Put out the cheese.

16:54.763 --> 16:56.597
What do you want to do tonight?

16:57.766 --> 16:59.809
Oh, doesn't really matter to me.

17:00.102 --> 17:03.771
Whatever you'd like to do,
Albert... Vic.

17:11.113 --> 17:15.950
Well, now that we're loaded,
I guess we could hit The Turf.

17:18.119 --> 17:20.454
Yes, we could do that.

17:22.124 --> 17:26.669
- Well, if you'd rather not.
- Oh, no, no, no, that'd be fine.

17:26.962 --> 17:32.633
We could probably even afford
a little pop... popcorn.

17:54.406 --> 17:57.241
Mat's good for the rifle.
Put it in the water there.

17:57.534 --> 18:00.244
They're getting wet there,
move them over. Goes to rust fast.

18:00.537 --> 18:02.121
Move on along.

18:03.332 --> 18:06.000
You money-grabbing toad,
you move my stuff over!

18:06.293 --> 18:08.878
Move his heat. We don't want
no trouble tonight.

18:15.636 --> 18:17.053
If it picks up one rust spot,

18:17.346 --> 18:19.347
you're going to wake up
with a crowd around you.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.864
- Sardines...
- We could use some!

18:38.534 --> 18:41.202
- What about the mutt?
- He ain't no mutt.

18:41.495 --> 18:43.412
You wanna see the movies
or don't you?

18:59.555 --> 19:01.055
Peaches.

19:05.727 --> 19:07.288
How the hell
am I supposed to know that?

19:07.563 --> 19:09.230
You can read, can't you?

19:13.569 --> 19:15.444
Peaches for the dog.

19:15.737 --> 19:17.738
Beets are better for him anyway.

19:21.577 --> 19:22.898
Seen a screamer 'bout a mile out.

19:23.036 --> 19:24.162
Which way's he headed?

19:24.454 --> 19:26.789
Think I'd stick around to find out?
I said screamers.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.921
- I want popcorn.
- Pass.

19:34.214 --> 19:36.465
- You said we'd get some.
- You said.

19:36.758 --> 19:38.801
Come on, Albert,
buy me some popcorn.

19:39.094 --> 19:41.345
I'm tapped.
You can live without it.

19:41.638 --> 19:43.598
You're just being an ass.

19:43.891 --> 19:46.726
You remember that next time
you want to call me Albert.

19:50.606 --> 19:54.275
I hope the next time you play
with yourself, you go blind.

20:27.935 --> 20:29.435
Come on, let's sit down front.

20:37.653 --> 20:38.819
Sit down!

20:43.909 --> 20:45.910
Get your ass over there,
I want to sit here.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.915
How can you enjoy
a show without popcorn?

21:12.354 --> 21:15.523
All right, tightwad,
watch the master at work.

21:25.826 --> 21:27.368
Charity is a thing of the past.

21:27.661 --> 21:30.162
Say, Mark, you got
a grease rag handy?

21:36.044 --> 21:39.088
He shot my brother,
we all know that!

21:39.381 --> 21:41.090
Now, about my brother!

21:42.509 --> 21:44.385
He just got here!
He's right over there!

21:44.678 --> 21:46.429
We can't have that lunatic
runnin' loose, I tell you!

21:46.722 --> 21:49.056
Now, how 'bout that, men?

21:51.560 --> 21:53.480
Sheriff doesn't come,
I don't know what he'll do.

21:53.729 --> 21:55.396
There's a female in here.

21:58.233 --> 21:59.900
You're nuts.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.404
I tell you, she's in here.

22:08.952 --> 22:10.286
Where?

22:13.540 --> 22:14.582
Where is she?

22:18.253 --> 22:19.795
Wait a minute.

22:20.088 --> 22:23.591
Come on out here.
I want to talk to you.

22:39.149 --> 22:43.235
Lying egg sucker, I ought to kick
your tail up around your ears.

22:43.528 --> 22:45.208
Expect me to believe
that you can whiff her

22:45.322 --> 22:47.239
when there ain't no other dog in
the whole joint that's caught her yet?

22:47.532 --> 22:50.326
Now you forget my infallibility,
Albert, that's foolish.

22:50.619 --> 22:53.621
No I didn't forget,
I just don't believe it.

22:57.751 --> 22:58.918
Where is she?

23:03.465 --> 23:04.632
Knock it off!

23:07.469 --> 23:09.720
How the hell
can I see the picture?

23:11.973 --> 23:14.141
- Get 'em out of here!
- Sic the dogs on 'em!

23:14.434 --> 23:16.102
Turn up the sound!

23:22.484 --> 23:25.027
Okay, all right, I was dumb.

23:25.320 --> 23:28.197
You taught me all I know.
I believe everything you say.

23:51.096 --> 23:52.680
That wasn't her, was it?

23:53.849 --> 23:55.599
Come on. She might get away.

23:56.685 --> 23:58.352
I'll buy you the popcorn.

24:36.349 --> 24:39.268
Bottom line, you're a brain
with an educated nose

24:39.561 --> 24:41.604
and there's no other canine
in your class.

24:41.897 --> 24:43.698
She's dressed like a solo,
wearing a knit cap.

25:26.900 --> 25:27.540
Where's the kid?

25:27.776 --> 25:30.194
He's spending the night
with Johnny Lambert.

26:20.203 --> 26:26.667
Oh, please, take me now.

26:28.503 --> 26:32.590
Come on, get up. Not yet, guys.

26:39.014 --> 26:41.223
Damn it, Johnny, try!

26:41.516 --> 26:42.891
Look what I found.

26:52.068 --> 26:54.403
Okay? Which way'd she go?

26:54.696 --> 26:56.030
To the right.

26:57.991 --> 26:59.366
Come on.

27:05.248 --> 27:07.916
That's it for tonight.
Shut her down.

27:55.423 --> 27:57.675
That stupid broad.

27:57.967 --> 28:00.552
She's in there where
the screamers hole up.

28:02.222 --> 28:04.223
They're not in there now.
She's alone.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.475
Screamers.

28:06.768 --> 28:07.976
Damn it.

28:08.269 --> 28:10.354
How in the hell am I
going to nail her in there?

28:10.647 --> 28:13.982
Simple. Stop shaking like a leaf
and go do it.

28:25.203 --> 28:26.870
You sure it's clean?

28:28.123 --> 28:31.458
Albert, have I ever lied to you?

31:18.960 --> 31:22.296
I'm gonna go over there, and
I'm gonna get one of them mats.

31:22.589 --> 31:25.629
You make one move off there and I'll
shoot your leg right out from under you,

31:25.633 --> 31:28.260
and you'll still get it
except you'll be without a leg.

31:56.998 --> 31:58.957
Well, what are you looking at?

31:59.250 --> 32:00.542
What's your name?

32:03.171 --> 32:05.088
- Vic.
- Vic what?

32:06.215 --> 32:07.215
Just Vic.

32:07.508 --> 32:09.927
Then what are your mother
and father's names?

32:13.014 --> 32:15.557
Boy, are you a dumb broad.

32:21.648 --> 32:25.359
I told you to stop looking at me
like that or I'll bust your teeth out.

32:26.694 --> 32:28.445
Now get that stuff off.

32:50.051 --> 32:51.510
What's your name?

32:52.595 --> 32:54.638
Quilla June Holmes.

32:56.057 --> 32:57.265
That's a weird name.

32:57.558 --> 33:01.436
It's not. My mother says it's not
that unusual back in Oklahoma.

33:02.647 --> 33:04.523
That where your folks come from?

33:07.026 --> 33:08.443
Before the war.

33:08.736 --> 33:10.195
They must be pretty old by now.

33:15.243 --> 33:17.244
They are, but they're okay, I guess.

33:23.084 --> 33:25.711
Guess we'd better...

33:28.881 --> 33:30.882
- Now what?
- Rover pack. Twenty-three strong.

33:31.175 --> 33:32.592
They got the building surrounded.

33:32.885 --> 33:34.636
Great, some other mutt must have
smelled her in the theater.

33:34.929 --> 33:35.971
Who are you talking to?

33:36.264 --> 33:38.181
- Him.
- The dog?

33:38.474 --> 33:39.808
Give them the girl.

33:40.101 --> 33:41.518
We dig in and stand them off.

33:41.811 --> 33:43.895
They don't know about us. Just give
'em the girl, let's get outta here.

33:44.188 --> 33:46.481
We stay. Now you got
any helpful suggestions?

33:47.567 --> 33:49.735
Yes, pull up your pants, Romeo.

33:53.322 --> 33:55.449
Now would you listen to reason?

33:55.742 --> 33:58.302
There's too many of them for us.
You're gonna get us all shot up.

34:01.289 --> 34:02.956
Damn fool!

34:04.292 --> 34:07.961
One way out of here.
Boxed in, that's no good.

34:10.130 --> 34:13.132
Out there in the big room,
that's the place.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.511
Oh, Jesus. They'll probably
come down the ladder.

34:16.804 --> 34:18.847
What's the matter,
don't you talk to strangers?

34:19.139 --> 34:21.641
Shut up will you! I can see it.

34:21.934 --> 34:23.351
Do you understand me?

34:23.643 --> 34:25.937
If we can take one down
and get his heat...

34:26.230 --> 34:28.482
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Shut up!

34:57.637 --> 34:58.929
Lovely odds we're up against,
aren't they?

34:59.222 --> 35:00.702
You were right.
Let's set up for them.

35:00.973 --> 35:02.641
And I'm right
about this simpering female.

35:02.934 --> 35:05.560
Forget that. Now, how do you
figure the fight?

35:10.191 --> 35:12.859
You would too, if you
figured to stir screamers.

35:14.862 --> 35:16.488
Go on, we'll back ya'!

35:54.944 --> 35:56.528
Over there!

36:03.119 --> 36:04.494
Hey!

36:14.255 --> 36:16.590
He's moving again!

36:21.262 --> 36:24.139
Get off me! Get away!

36:55.546 --> 36:56.963
Where'd she go?

37:03.763 --> 37:05.722
Good or bad first?

37:06.015 --> 37:07.515
Bad.

37:07.808 --> 37:09.684
All right, they didn't come down
the ladder as I anticipated,

37:09.977 --> 37:12.979
and since they found other ways in,
we've lost the element of surprise.

37:13.272 --> 37:15.190
There's no way we can handle them.

37:16.067 --> 37:17.400
And the good?

37:17.693 --> 37:18.693
Let the seven dwarfs have Snow White

37:18.986 --> 37:21.029
and we can get out of here
with all our parts.

37:21.322 --> 37:23.156
Over my dead body.

37:24.325 --> 37:25.825
They're working on that right now.

37:39.340 --> 37:41.675
- Screamers.
- Where? I don't hear 'em.

37:41.968 --> 37:45.136
Now, what would everyone do
if they heard one right now?

37:45.429 --> 37:47.597
Run like a sonofabitch.

37:51.394 --> 37:52.894
It's worth a try.

38:04.198 --> 38:05.490
Screamer!

38:12.206 --> 38:13.415
You hear that?

38:16.085 --> 38:17.544
Screamers!

39:29.950 --> 39:32.243
Go on, damn it, get out of the way!

39:41.087 --> 39:44.339
Make certain they've gone, Vic.
Don't stick your empty head out, Vic.

39:44.632 --> 39:45.840
Hey, easy...

39:46.133 --> 39:48.802
Will you shut her up?
I can't hear myself think.

39:50.304 --> 39:51.846
Get something green.
Get her skirt.

39:52.139 --> 39:54.015
Wrap it around a stick
and wave it up there.

39:54.308 --> 39:55.809
Shine her flashlight up through it.

40:02.650 --> 40:04.150
Have they gone?

40:05.945 --> 40:07.237
What do you see?

40:09.824 --> 40:11.408
They are whipped!

40:13.494 --> 40:15.203
We did it!

40:15.496 --> 40:17.216
I'd have given a whole sack
full of potatoes

40:17.498 --> 40:19.874
to see the look on their faces
when they ran!

40:23.003 --> 40:25.672
Hey, Blood we did it, we did it!

40:27.258 --> 40:29.217
Come on, let's get the hell
out of here.

40:29.510 --> 40:32.053
They might still be out there.
Just pull back a little.

40:32.346 --> 40:33.888
Wait till daylight, then we'll see.

40:34.181 --> 40:36.516
Okay. Well, I'll take the chick in.

40:39.186 --> 40:40.854
She's right below us.

40:46.861 --> 40:49.863
You stupid nit! You wanna
run into one of 'em?

40:55.870 --> 40:59.247
You think I'm bad? Well you wait
till you see one of them.

40:59.540 --> 41:01.583
What are they?

41:01.876 --> 41:03.084
I don't know.

41:03.377 --> 41:04.919
I just know you stay away from them.

41:05.212 --> 41:06.379
What?

41:07.548 --> 41:08.715
Easy.

41:14.638 --> 41:20.393
'Cause if one of 'em touches you,
you're dead, green dead.

41:25.900 --> 41:27.233
The real thing! Move!

41:51.509 --> 41:53.635
- Come on.
- Where are you?

41:53.928 --> 41:55.529
By the boiler.
The insulation might help.

41:55.804 --> 41:57.972
Where are we going, Vic.
What is it? Why are we...?

41:58.265 --> 41:59.724
Shut up, and hang on to me.

42:00.017 --> 42:01.184
Hurry it up.

42:08.025 --> 42:09.776
Help me up there.

42:17.326 --> 42:18.826
Yes, this'll do.

42:28.963 --> 42:30.296
Clumsy.

42:35.302 --> 42:37.428
I wonder how many
mattresses are in here.

42:37.721 --> 42:40.014
Screamers certainly wouldn't
want to be confined.

42:40.307 --> 42:42.600
Albert! Tell this to keep
its hands to itself!

42:43.727 --> 42:46.020
Maybe somebody else hid in here.

42:46.313 --> 42:48.106
Get yer...

42:48.399 --> 42:51.818
Oh, well, somewhat
of a weak call I bet.

42:53.654 --> 42:56.864
- Catch anything yet?
- We're all right so far.

42:57.157 --> 42:58.616
You be able to tell when they leave?

42:58.909 --> 43:00.535
Yes, I'll be able to tell.

43:00.828 --> 43:02.412
If they leave.

43:06.250 --> 43:08.835
Just take it easy.
Everything's going to be all right.

43:13.632 --> 43:15.675
That is, if we don't
get choked off in here.

43:20.514 --> 43:21.598
Can you handle it?

43:21.890 --> 43:24.434
Oh, yes, Massa Vic,
I can handle it.

45:17.381 --> 45:20.007
Breeding is an ugly thing.

45:22.177 --> 45:26.347
Long enough for the final missiles
to leave their silos on both sides.

45:26.640 --> 45:29.517
Let's see. That was in 2006.

45:29.810 --> 45:30.893
2007.

45:31.186 --> 45:34.981
2007. It only lasted 5 days.

45:35.274 --> 45:37.442
You're awfully smart
to know all that history.

45:40.404 --> 45:42.321
Well, Blood helps... a little.

45:43.949 --> 45:45.270
Haven't you ever been down under?

45:45.325 --> 45:47.535
- Nope.
- Why?

45:47.828 --> 45:51.205
- It's very nice.
- I heard how nice.

45:51.498 --> 45:54.041
From a solo who raided one.

45:54.334 --> 45:56.210
Well, it's very nice, and you'd like it.

45:56.503 --> 45:59.380
- Bullshit!
- That's very crude.

45:59.673 --> 46:00.840
I'm very crude.

46:03.510 --> 46:04.719
Not all the time.

46:05.012 --> 46:08.222
Listen, ass, I grabbed you
and I drug you down here.

46:08.515 --> 46:10.516
So what's so good about me?

46:13.353 --> 46:15.938
I didn't mind. I liked it.

46:17.024 --> 46:18.524
You want to do it again?

46:21.904 --> 46:25.782
Well, I've never seen no...
no chick like you before!

46:26.074 --> 46:31.579
Hey, I'm the... I'm the one that's
supposed to wanna... do it.

46:31.872 --> 46:34.874
Once more into the breech,
dear friend.

46:44.218 --> 46:46.677
Copula: Something that connects.

46:46.970 --> 46:50.389
Copulate: From the Latin
copulatus, to engage in...

46:51.767 --> 46:56.062
Honey, it's good to just watch you.

46:56.355 --> 46:57.897
Your waist falls in.

46:58.982 --> 47:02.819
And your hips out,
to have you right in my hands.

47:04.238 --> 47:05.279
Just want to talk.

47:05.572 --> 47:09.242
I'm not going to keep
pretending I am asleep, Albert.

47:19.586 --> 47:22.296
Oh, boy, you're a bloody mess.

47:22.589 --> 47:25.591
Well, you're not exactly
a rose garden yourself.

47:26.927 --> 47:28.594
We'll get out of here yet.

47:30.764 --> 47:33.307
Seems clear.
I'd better go have a look.

47:33.600 --> 47:36.811
Think you can... think you can
handle it in your condition?

47:37.104 --> 47:39.188
Can I handle it in my condition?

47:40.274 --> 47:42.650
I can handle several hours on the rack

47:42.943 --> 47:46.529
to extricate myself
from this disgusting display.

47:49.783 --> 47:50.825
Blood!

47:51.118 --> 47:52.493
No sacrifice is too great.

47:52.786 --> 47:56.372
No, I throw myself gladly
into the very jaws

47:56.665 --> 47:58.666
of the screaming, grim death.

48:11.972 --> 48:14.140
I don't think he likes me very much.

48:15.642 --> 48:17.351
- Blood?
- Yeah.

48:17.644 --> 48:21.689
He... he just feels bad.
He likes you a lot.

48:21.982 --> 48:24.483
- He told me so.
- He did really?

48:26.153 --> 48:28.821
That's nice, 'cause I...
I think he's cute.

48:32.618 --> 48:34.368
How do you do it?

48:34.661 --> 48:36.287
- What?
- Talk to him.

48:37.372 --> 48:39.290
I don't know,
I never thought about it.

48:39.583 --> 48:40.750
Just talk.

48:42.753 --> 48:44.253
Well, how come I can't hear him?

48:46.673 --> 48:48.507
He said something one time.

48:50.677 --> 48:53.179
It's 'cause we had a feeling
for each other or something.

48:56.183 --> 48:57.892
What do you mean, like love?

48:58.185 --> 48:59.727
I guess.

49:00.020 --> 49:01.354
I don't know.

49:02.522 --> 49:03.856
He said we thought alike.

49:05.359 --> 49:06.525
I don't know.

49:09.321 --> 49:12.156
Well, anyway...

49:17.037 --> 49:19.914
We'll get a nice little place...

49:20.207 --> 49:23.334
and we'll spend a lot of time
together alone...

49:23.627 --> 49:26.253
and we'll do whatever
we feel like doing,

49:26.546 --> 49:30.716
and when Blood comes to visit,
he can have his own room.

49:33.428 --> 49:34.679
What are you talking about?

49:34.972 --> 49:37.640
Well, I don't exactly think
he's going to fit in Down Under.

49:37.933 --> 49:39.600
No way!

49:39.893 --> 49:41.102
I know, that's what I said.

49:41.395 --> 49:44.271
No, I mean, no way
I'm going down there.

49:44.564 --> 49:45.648
Why?

49:46.733 --> 49:48.025
I'm going to be there.

49:48.318 --> 49:49.944
No, you're not.

49:50.237 --> 49:52.196
We'll make it up here, the three of us.

49:52.489 --> 49:54.240
Vic, now I live there.

49:54.533 --> 49:56.575
- If you love me...
- I don't care!

49:59.997 --> 50:01.247
Come out here right now.

50:02.749 --> 50:04.917
Vic, we need to talk.

50:13.844 --> 50:15.511
What the hell's lumbering you?

50:15.804 --> 50:18.472
Your headlong plunge into stupidity.

50:18.765 --> 50:20.641
Last night was inexcusable.

50:20.934 --> 50:23.894
Leaving her for the pack, that would
have been the intelligent thing to do!

50:24.104 --> 50:25.187
I wanted her.

50:25.480 --> 50:27.314
Yeah, I know you wanted her
about half a hundred times.

50:27.607 --> 50:29.150
And why we still hanging around?

50:29.443 --> 50:30.651
I want her some more!

50:30.944 --> 50:33.112
Well, listen, my friend, I want to
get rid of this pain in my side

50:33.405 --> 50:34.822
and I want to get away from here.

50:35.115 --> 50:37.158
The screamers could come back
any time, you know.

50:37.451 --> 50:39.493
What the hell you worried
about that for?

50:39.786 --> 50:41.162
We can handle all that.

50:41.455 --> 50:42.895
That don't mean
she can't go with us.

50:42.956 --> 50:46.500
Go with us? Are you out
of your small mind?

50:46.793 --> 50:50.004
What good is she? It's all we can do
to feed ourselves, as it is.

50:50.297 --> 50:52.538
You know, you're starting to sound
like a goddamn poodle!

50:52.632 --> 50:55.551
And you're starting to sound
like a jackass.

50:59.973 --> 51:01.140
Sorry.

51:03.477 --> 51:05.019
Oh, Blood, come on.

51:05.312 --> 51:06.812
Hey, man.

51:08.982 --> 51:12.860
It'll still be 50/50 with you and me.
I mean, hell, I owe you.

51:13.153 --> 51:15.613
Don't try that hackneyed ruse on me.

51:15.906 --> 51:19.033
Oh, come on, I just meant
like that time that...

51:19.326 --> 51:22.036
that old screamer
made a grab for me.

51:22.329 --> 51:25.039
You know, that righteous
tone green he was too,

51:25.332 --> 51:28.793
all glowing like a fungus,
and oozing and eyelashes...

51:30.504 --> 51:31.670
Boy.

51:33.173 --> 51:35.883
Made a grab for me,
and you went for him.

51:36.176 --> 51:39.595
Could have been burned bad,
too, I'll tell you that,

51:39.888 --> 51:41.388
and died.

51:42.682 --> 51:45.893
That'd have been
all of it for you, right?

51:46.186 --> 51:48.104
Now get that dramatic catch
out of your voice and tell me

51:48.396 --> 51:50.436
how she's gonna carry her share
of the load up here.

51:50.607 --> 51:51.690
Tell me how we're gonna fight off...

51:51.983 --> 51:53.663
All right, okay, okay,
just don't hang her.

51:53.693 --> 51:54.735
Harangue, not hang her.

51:55.028 --> 51:57.428
I don't care whatever the hell it is,
just knock off the crap

51:57.572 --> 51:58.739
or we can forget the whole
stinkin' arrangement.

51:59.032 --> 52:00.908
Well, maybe we should,
you simple, dumb putz.

52:01.201 --> 52:03.285
What the hell's a putz?
What's a putz?

52:03.578 --> 52:06.539
Is that something bad?
I'll bet it is. It's something bad.

52:06.832 --> 52:08.832
I'll tell you, you better watch
your stinking mouth

52:08.875 --> 52:10.709
or I'm going to kick you in the butt!

52:24.558 --> 52:26.392
Definitely a putz.

52:36.570 --> 52:38.612
"Don't mean she can't go with us."

52:38.905 --> 52:40.322
I told she was no good.

52:40.615 --> 52:43.284
Okay, okay.

52:43.577 --> 52:46.287
I just don't like being made
to feel guilty.

52:46.580 --> 52:47.788
I'm gonna do right by you.

52:48.081 --> 52:49.123
I'd highly recommend that,

52:49.416 --> 52:51.125
considering there are several very
knowledgeable solos around town

52:51.418 --> 52:52.501
who'd be delighted to work

52:52.794 --> 52:54.962
with an accomplished
female provider like myself.

52:55.255 --> 52:56.797
I also don't like being threatened!

52:57.090 --> 52:58.411
It's not a threat, that's a fact.

52:58.633 --> 53:00.593
No, that's a good way
to get that other leg broke.

53:00.760 --> 53:03.179
Don't take your petty
frustrations out on me, Albert.

53:03.471 --> 53:04.972
I locate females,
I don't guarantee their behavior.

53:05.265 --> 53:07.183
- What the hell's that?
- How should I know?

53:07.475 --> 53:08.684
Well, smell it!

53:08.977 --> 53:12.771
It's probably ID of some kind she
used to get out of the Down Under.

53:13.064 --> 53:15.482
Now we're in a big hurry.

53:16.693 --> 53:18.773
Now, if you'd listened to me
last night instead of...

53:19.029 --> 53:20.196
Wait a minute.

53:20.488 --> 53:23.115
You're not thinking
of following that...

53:23.408 --> 53:24.909
You... you listen to me, Albert!

53:27.621 --> 53:29.288
You... you'll get killed out there!

53:31.374 --> 53:34.001
Albert. Albert. You come back here!

53:34.294 --> 53:37.004
You idiot, you can't go down there.
You listen to me.

53:37.297 --> 53:38.618
Just because some stinking female

53:38.798 --> 53:39.882
knocked you in the head
and bruised your ego,

53:40.175 --> 53:41.675
there's no reason to become
a careless juvenile.

53:41.968 --> 53:43.844
You stop this instant, Albert!

53:44.137 --> 53:47.431
- Vic. Egg-sucker.
- All right. Vic, please, now...

53:48.558 --> 53:50.476
Please stop a minute, please.

54:00.403 --> 54:02.655
I don't know what to say,
how to make you understand.

54:02.948 --> 54:04.588
You're not... you're not thinking
clearly.

54:04.658 --> 54:07.034
You can't go down there
and... and ever hope to come back,

54:07.327 --> 54:08.994
and she knows it.

54:09.287 --> 54:10.371
Down Unders hate solos.

54:10.664 --> 54:12.539
Enough rover packs have
raided down there

54:12.832 --> 54:14.552
and raped their women
and stolen their food,

54:14.834 --> 54:17.274
and they'll have their defenses up
and catch you and kill you.

54:17.337 --> 54:19.546
What the hell do you care?

54:19.839 --> 54:22.049
Always saying you'd be
better of without me, anyway.

54:22.342 --> 54:24.385
Forget about her, Vic. Let her go.

54:24.678 --> 54:28.055
Let's... let's look
for Over the Hill, or...

54:28.348 --> 54:31.892
If you're tired of me,
find another partner somewhere,

54:32.185 --> 54:35.396
but whatever you do,
don't follow her down there.

54:35.689 --> 54:37.189
I got to, Blood.

54:38.942 --> 54:40.025
I got to.

54:40.318 --> 54:44.154
Hasn't occurred to you how convenient
this whole operation has been?

54:44.447 --> 54:48.325
How easy she was to spot and follow,
and how she cooperated?

54:48.618 --> 54:50.911
Just think about it, Vic, instead of
walking right into their hands.

54:51.204 --> 54:53.038
God knows what they'll do with you.

55:08.430 --> 55:12.391
We've been together long time,
good and bad, but...

55:12.684 --> 55:16.562
this could be the worst. I'm scared.

55:17.647 --> 55:18.847
I'm scared you won't come back

55:19.065 --> 55:22.568
and I'll have to find some rover
to take me on.

55:24.070 --> 55:26.030
You know most rovers
are in packs now,

55:26.323 --> 55:28.574
and I'm not that young anymore.

55:31.036 --> 55:32.453
And I'll miss you, Vic.

55:38.126 --> 55:39.585
I'll really miss you.

55:44.549 --> 55:45.716
Well...

55:48.178 --> 55:49.970
Try to get back as quick as I can.

55:51.598 --> 55:52.765
Will you wait?

55:54.601 --> 55:57.519
For a while, then Over the Hill.

56:11.284 --> 56:12.993
Take care of yourself.

56:13.286 --> 56:14.620
Do my best.

56:16.247 --> 56:17.498
I'll catch up with you.

56:19.542 --> 56:20.709
Sure.

56:45.652 --> 56:47.277
So long...

56:47.570 --> 56:48.737
partner.

59:14.968 --> 59:19.179
And with these terrifying sounds
of primeval savagery,

59:19.472 --> 59:22.349
we close the Committee's
presentation

59:22.642 --> 59:26.311
of sound tours into the past.

59:26.604 --> 59:30.857
Today, chapter 3:
Africa, the dark continent.

59:31.150 --> 59:34.987
Tomorrow, chapter 4: Alaska.

59:45.665 --> 59:50.127
Michael, yellow reference,
a malfunction.

59:50.420 --> 59:53.171
Level 10, op section 6.

59:53.464 --> 59:56.675
Repeat, yellow reference.

01:00:07.854 --> 01:00:12.733
"We often despise
what is most useful to us."

01:00:14.027 --> 01:00:16.737
Another helpful hint

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:19.865
from the Committee's almanac.

01:00:41.721 --> 01:00:45.599
"The town is the tear of the man."

01:00:45.892 --> 01:00:51.563
Another helpful hint for living,
from the Committee's almanac.

01:01:13.127 --> 01:01:16.630
It is exactly 10 a.m.
On this Wednesday,

01:01:16.923 --> 01:01:22.094
June 29, Year of Our Lord
one-aught-three.

01:01:22.387 --> 01:01:24.930
The Committee has decided...

01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:49.705
May I have the chicken salad,
please?

01:01:53.209 --> 01:01:55.252
Excuse me, please.
A little mustard.

01:01:55.545 --> 01:01:56.712
Thank you.

01:02:16.983 --> 01:02:18.358
The Committee,

01:02:18.651 --> 01:02:22.028
sitting in Awards
and Punishments session,

01:02:22.321 --> 01:02:27.451
committed to all;
Attendance discretionary.

01:02:27.744 --> 01:02:28.827
One hour.

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.663
Repeat: One hour.

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.375
Be it resolved therefore
that Mrs. Eunice Long

01:02:35.668 --> 01:02:37.229
has been declared
the blue ribbon winner

01:02:37.503 --> 01:02:40.547
of the annual Topeka
canning festival,

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:43.341
and that throughout the Year
of Our Lord one-aught-three,

01:02:43.634 --> 01:02:47.512
all preserved peaches,
be they canned and/or jarred,

01:02:47.805 --> 01:02:51.349
shall bear her likeness
and the inscription "Topeka Queen."

01:02:54.729 --> 01:02:58.398
Michael, green reference.

01:02:58.691 --> 01:03:01.735
Hydroponic laboratory, number 173.

01:03:02.028 --> 01:03:03.487
Fanny and Jurdan MacBurnatt.

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:06.281
Saturation of nutrient solution.

01:03:06.574 --> 01:03:09.576
Repeat: Green reference.

01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:15.040
This is the best
the architects could do.

01:03:16.542 --> 01:03:17.709
Pencil.

01:03:22.965 --> 01:03:24.424
Why are they here?

01:03:24.717 --> 01:03:26.593
Lack of respect. Wrong attitude.

01:03:26.886 --> 01:03:28.762
Failure to obey authority.

01:03:29.055 --> 01:03:31.306
- Lectures?
- Three.

01:03:31.599 --> 01:03:34.059
- Cut-and-dry, then.
- I'd say so.

01:03:34.352 --> 01:03:36.102
That'll do it.

01:03:44.237 --> 01:03:46.696
Fanny and Jurdan MacBurnatt.

01:03:46.989 --> 01:03:49.032
Any reason to be easy?

01:03:49.325 --> 01:03:51.159
Look, when we...

01:03:51.452 --> 01:03:52.619
put this in,

01:03:52.912 --> 01:03:55.413
see, then we'll add that.

01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:59.417
We find it almost impossible to believe

01:03:59.710 --> 01:04:02.629
that you have ignored several
warnings by us to conform

01:04:02.922 --> 01:04:05.966
to the rules that are vital to the
continued growth and well-being

01:04:06.259 --> 01:04:08.093
of our beloved Topeka,
but you did.

01:04:09.762 --> 01:04:11.137
Defiance of this Committee,

01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:14.432
duly elected and ordained
by the people, will not be tolerated.

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:17.310
The Farm, both of 'em.

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:21.398
Now how'd the last farms go, Mez?

01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:23.650
Cancer, I think.
No, no, no.

01:04:23.943 --> 01:04:25.110
Let me see.

01:04:25.403 --> 01:04:27.320
I have it down here.

01:04:27.613 --> 01:04:32.158
Let's see. Oh, no, it was
an accident with farm machinery,

01:04:32.451 --> 01:04:33.535
that's what it was.

01:04:33.828 --> 01:04:36.830
Larry and Linda Lacey,
March 17 of this year.

01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:40.834
Let's make these...
heart attacks.

01:04:42.211 --> 01:04:44.004
Yeah, grief from the Committee.

01:04:44.297 --> 01:04:46.172
Doc'll do the eulogy.

01:04:46.465 --> 01:04:48.842
Services at Lakeside Methodist,
the usual.

01:04:49.135 --> 01:04:52.304
And may God
have mercy on your souls.

01:04:55.141 --> 01:04:57.517
Now that's the way to build
a cotton gin.

01:04:59.353 --> 01:05:00.854
Quilla June!

01:05:01.147 --> 01:05:04.608
Honey! Come to papa.

01:05:07.486 --> 01:05:09.988
Sure is pleasing to see you
back home again.

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:13.741
Didn't have any trouble?
Everything went all right.

01:05:13.951 --> 01:05:15.391
- Didn't have any trouble?
- No, sir.

01:05:15.536 --> 01:05:19.247
That's fine, fine.

01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:20.999
Sure did yourself proud, missy.

01:05:21.292 --> 01:05:23.376
The Committee won't forget it,
no siree!

01:05:23.669 --> 01:05:26.379
Then I'll be put on the Committee
right away, like we talked about.

01:05:26.672 --> 01:05:30.675
Don't you worry about it,
little girl, soon as there's an opening.

01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:35.013
Mr. Craddock,
I would prefer not to wait.

01:05:36.098 --> 01:05:39.100
After all, I did bring Vic down here
exactly like you told me to.

01:05:39.393 --> 01:05:42.395
Now you just be patient, Quilla June.

01:05:42.688 --> 01:05:44.648
Have fun with the young folks
your own age.

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:47.567
Think about getting married,
making a home.

01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:49.945
Your time will come.

01:05:50.237 --> 01:05:52.572
I'd rather be just like you, Miss Mez.

01:05:52.865 --> 01:05:54.616
And not wait.

01:05:54.909 --> 01:05:56.743
Don't you worry, little girl.

01:05:57.036 --> 01:05:59.704
- I don't see why you just...
- That'll be all, that'll be all.

01:06:07.838 --> 01:06:09.839
That young lady's
going to be trouble.

01:06:10.132 --> 01:06:13.760
Always has been.
Any reason for her to change?

01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:15.493
Maybe you should have gone to three.

01:06:16.889 --> 01:06:20.266
Little childish plotting
doesn't bother me none.

01:06:20.559 --> 01:06:21.935
Long as it stays little.

01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:26.106
Mez...

01:06:26.399 --> 01:06:28.608
see that she's one of the recipients.

01:06:28.901 --> 01:06:31.778
Then marry her off to Hiram
and Edna's boy. What's his name?

01:06:32.071 --> 01:06:34.280
- Charles.
- Charlie, yeah.

01:06:34.573 --> 01:06:38.243
If that don't cool her ambitions,
farm her out.

01:06:38.536 --> 01:06:39.869
Horse manure.

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:43.498
He knew I wanted on that Committee.

01:06:43.791 --> 01:06:46.459
Stupid, stinkin' old rotter, Lou!

01:06:49.797 --> 01:06:51.548
I am bristling!

01:06:59.765 --> 01:07:03.268
That is the only reason
I went along with their dumb plan.

01:07:13.362 --> 01:07:16.322
America, the land of plenty,
was the world's greatest agricultural...

01:07:16.615 --> 01:07:18.324
- They promised me.
- Promised?

01:07:18.617 --> 01:07:21.161
Capable not only of feeding
its own hardworking...

01:07:21.454 --> 01:07:22.912
Well, they hinted.

01:07:23.205 --> 01:07:25.457
Then they tried to shoo me off
without a by-your-leave, so I pushed.

01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:27.000
Well, you shouldn't have.

01:07:27.293 --> 01:07:28.894
I mean, they're gonna be
watching us now.

01:07:29.754 --> 01:07:33.673
Gery, I don't care.
I am so sick and tired...

01:07:33.966 --> 01:07:35.050
The Farm.

01:07:35.342 --> 01:07:37.886
The poor, who accepted
our Christian desire

01:07:38.179 --> 01:07:40.764
to aid our brothers
across the seas...

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:42.849
You're right.

01:07:43.142 --> 01:07:44.309
I do care.

01:07:46.145 --> 01:07:47.687
Okay.

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:50.023
I'm going to smile,

01:07:50.316 --> 01:07:54.027
and I'm going to curtsy
the right time to all the right people,

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:56.029
'cause it ain't going to be much longer.

01:07:56.322 --> 01:07:59.866
The Psalms of David will not wait
even for you, Quilla June Holmes.

01:08:00.159 --> 01:08:03.203
- That is your class...
- Yes, Mrs. Cammock.

01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:05.205
Old pigeon feet.

01:08:05.498 --> 01:08:08.083
I'm sorry.
I'll be right there, ma'am.

01:08:12.171 --> 01:08:13.338
See you later.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:31.361
He and Vic were in the park together,
I turned my back for just a sec...

01:08:45.537 --> 01:08:46.746
What'd you and Vic talk about?

01:08:47.038 --> 01:08:51.209
- Come on, we want to know.
- Well, Lou.

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:56.714
He's still a little confused.

01:08:57.006 --> 01:08:58.341
Yeah, good.

01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:03.179
Now, how about it boy?

01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:07.767
I mean, we're gonna find out anyway,
so... why don't you just tell us

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:10.728
and it'll make it easier
on all of us?

01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:12.689
What do you say?

01:09:15.317 --> 01:09:16.484
How about it boy?

01:09:20.573 --> 01:09:22.407
The Farm, immediately.

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:27.620
Grandmother's Conrad's recipe
for rhubarb marmalade.

01:09:27.912 --> 01:09:29.956
Let me go!

01:09:30.249 --> 01:09:31.916
Orange juice and lemon juice...

01:09:33.752 --> 01:09:35.086
What did the exam show?

01:09:35.379 --> 01:09:37.130
Well, the usual cold virus.

01:09:37.423 --> 01:09:40.104
A little high blood pressure, to be
expected under these conditions.

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:45.596
There no infection. He's well developed,
reasonably well nourished.

01:09:46.932 --> 01:09:50.268
Intelligent average.
Emotional responses simplistic.

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:54.314
Most marked finding is his
overtly aggressive behavior.

01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:56.816
In other words,
he's extremely physical,

01:09:57.109 --> 01:09:58.443
as you may have noticed.

01:10:00.112 --> 01:10:02.739
- Well, now son.
- Suck wind, wet brain.

01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:05.241
Better be nice, boy.

01:10:05.534 --> 01:10:08.161
I hope all your stinking kids
are harelipped.

01:10:08.454 --> 01:10:10.121
- Michael.
- All right.

01:10:11.916 --> 01:10:13.249
Better behave yourself.

01:10:16.003 --> 01:10:19.672
Along with many other organisms...

01:10:19.965 --> 01:10:23.676
that somehow managed
to stay alive up above,

01:10:23.969 --> 01:10:26.179
you have been studied, observed.

01:10:26.472 --> 01:10:28.181
Unobtrusively, of course.

01:10:28.474 --> 01:10:30.850
Living habits, common sense,

01:10:31.143 --> 01:10:35.188
tenacity, physical prowess.

01:10:35.481 --> 01:10:36.689
Out of the many,

01:10:36.982 --> 01:10:39.025
you have been chosen...

01:10:40.653 --> 01:10:42.570
led down here by...

01:10:42.863 --> 01:10:44.155
Quilla June!

01:10:44.448 --> 01:10:46.115
To be the recipient of an honor...

01:10:46.408 --> 01:10:48.368
You know, she's a scumbag!

01:10:48.661 --> 01:10:50.578
Watch your foul mouth, boy.

01:10:50.871 --> 01:10:53.039
When anybody
on the Committee speaks,

01:10:53.332 --> 01:10:55.375
you just keep still and listen.

01:10:55.668 --> 01:10:58.378
Hey, how would like to have a rifle
rammed up your butt?

01:10:58.671 --> 01:11:00.880
- Michael!
- All right, all right!

01:11:01.173 --> 01:11:02.966
You show respect, boy.

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:05.385
As I was saying.

01:11:05.678 --> 01:11:09.514
To be the recipient of an honor
that occurs but once

01:11:09.807 --> 01:11:11.224
in several decades.

01:11:12.351 --> 01:11:13.851
Now, Mez...

01:11:14.144 --> 01:11:17.689
let me have the original
Elders Proclamation, will you?

01:11:21.402 --> 01:11:24.737
"The fruit of your loins will enable
the productive citizenry of Topeka"

01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:27.073
"to overcome metabolic changes
resulting from"

01:11:27.366 --> 01:11:29.409
lengthy subterranean living,

01:11:29.702 --> 01:11:31.462
"allow it to keep
its leadership in the drive

01:11:31.704 --> 01:11:35.373
to remake this sinful world
in God's own image."

01:11:35.666 --> 01:11:38.584
See, we've been underground
too long.

01:11:38.877 --> 01:11:40.037
Our woman can't get pregnant.

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:43.214
Every once in a while,
we need new blood.

01:11:44.258 --> 01:11:46.509
We... need a new man.

01:11:48.679 --> 01:11:51.097
"We are never so happy,
nor so unhappy...

01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:53.933
- A new man.
- "As we imagine."

01:11:54.226 --> 01:11:58.771
Another helpful hint for living,
from the Committee's almanac.

01:11:59.064 --> 01:12:00.857
Special kind of man.

01:12:07.906 --> 01:12:10.533
You mean you want me
to knock up your broads?

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:20.418
You talked me into it.
Line 'em up!

01:12:20.711 --> 01:12:22.128
You first, honey.

01:12:22.421 --> 01:12:23.588
Take your hands off me!

01:12:33.724 --> 01:12:36.017
Guide them together,
we beseech thee,

01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:38.478
in the way of righteousness
and peace that

01:12:38.771 --> 01:12:40.813
loving and serving thee

01:12:41.106 --> 01:12:43.608
with one heart and mind
all the days of their life,

01:12:43.901 --> 01:12:47.570
they may be abundantly
enriched with the tokens of

01:12:47.863 --> 01:12:52.450
thy everlasting favor. Amen.

01:12:52.743 --> 01:12:54.660
By authority vested in me
by the Committee,

01:12:54.953 --> 01:12:57.455
I hereby pronounce you
husband and wife,

01:12:57.748 --> 01:13:01.501
According to the ordinances
and the laws of the State of Topeka.

01:13:01.794 --> 01:13:04.837
What God has joined together,
let no man put asunder.

01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:06.756
Amen.

01:13:07.049 --> 01:13:09.801
"A man should never be
ashamed to own

01:13:10.094 --> 01:13:11.844
"he has been in the wrong,

01:13:12.137 --> 01:13:15.014
"which is but saying
that he is wiser today

01:13:15.307 --> 01:13:17.558
than he was yesterday."

01:13:17.851 --> 01:13:23.106
Another helpful hint for living
from the Committee's almanac.

01:13:26.443 --> 01:13:30.446
Mez, you wouldn't have a little
something to help a well-used throat?

01:13:30.739 --> 01:13:33.366
And be sure to get both parents
to sign right here.

01:13:33.659 --> 01:13:36.119
Now, let's see Brother Hexler.

01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:39.872
Michael, amber reference.

01:13:40.165 --> 01:13:44.669
Air intake fan number 12,
shaft 17B

01:13:44.962 --> 01:13:46.879
indicates heat buildup.

01:13:47.172 --> 01:13:50.508
Repeat: Amber reference.

01:14:08.694 --> 01:14:11.404
Chapter One,
verse twenty-two, Mayor.

01:14:11.697 --> 01:14:14.323
God blessed them
and said be fruitful and multiply.

01:14:14.616 --> 01:14:16.784
God blessed them
and lets them be.

01:14:25.377 --> 01:14:28.045
You almost asked yourself
out of this honor, young lady.

01:14:28.338 --> 01:14:29.964
Sir?

01:14:30.257 --> 01:14:31.757
The Committee.

01:14:32.050 --> 01:14:35.595
Oh, well, I'm sure
the Committee knows best.

01:14:35.888 --> 01:14:37.513
Where are your parents?

01:14:37.806 --> 01:14:40.099
Miss Mez said it would be all right.

01:14:40.392 --> 01:14:41.601
They must have
come down with something,

01:14:41.894 --> 01:14:43.374
'cause they're sure not feeling well.

01:14:43.437 --> 01:14:44.770
Shall we keep the schedule?
Dearly beloved...

01:14:45.063 --> 01:14:46.230
Brother Hexler.

01:14:48.692 --> 01:14:50.493
Dearly beloved, we are
gathered here to see...

01:14:53.906 --> 01:14:56.073
Vic, I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?

01:14:56.366 --> 01:14:59.076
They made me do it. You gotta
understand, they made me do it.

01:14:59.369 --> 01:15:00.870
They started it.

01:15:04.416 --> 01:15:06.918
Don't you give me that
"I'm sorry" bullshit.

01:15:07.211 --> 01:15:09.052
You're as crazy as the rest
of these damn nuts.

01:15:09.087 --> 01:15:10.755
Keep your voice down!

01:15:12.257 --> 01:15:14.759
They may be stupid,
but they're not dumb like you.

01:15:15.052 --> 01:15:17.386
Oh, no? They bring me down here
to make babies

01:15:17.679 --> 01:15:20.806
and then hook me up to this
stupid machine? That's real smart.

01:15:21.099 --> 01:15:23.518
Population control, Vic,
in case you haven't heard of it.

01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:25.131
Thirty-five girls are impregnated

01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:27.813
and then you are killed,
you understand?

01:15:28.106 --> 01:15:30.650
We don't have idiots like you
running around the place.

01:15:30.943 --> 01:15:32.818
So you wiggled your little butt...

01:15:33.111 --> 01:15:34.987
and teased me down here
to their big wealth.

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:38.783
I had to! They said kill me
if I didn't. Listen!

01:15:39.076 --> 01:15:41.786
Next. Next, please.

01:15:42.079 --> 01:15:45.456
No, ladies, I want you to be sure
to put your name here.

01:15:45.749 --> 01:15:47.166
His name goes here.

01:15:47.459 --> 01:15:49.794
And there's another thing
I want you to make very sure of

01:15:50.087 --> 01:15:51.837
on this most solemn and joyous...

01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:53.548
I'm gonna run Topeka.

01:15:58.136 --> 01:15:59.345
You and me.

01:15:59.638 --> 01:16:01.347
Maybe some others.

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:02.932
We'll be the Committee.

01:16:03.225 --> 01:16:05.851
Do anything we want,
any time we want.

01:16:06.144 --> 01:16:09.313
We'll have them bow
and scrape for a change.

01:16:09.606 --> 01:16:11.566
Just by springing me?

01:16:11.858 --> 01:16:14.318
Yeah, and getting rid
of the Committee.

01:16:17.155 --> 01:16:18.531
Okay, where's my heat?

01:16:18.824 --> 01:16:19.865
What?

01:16:20.158 --> 01:16:21.534
My guns, where's my guns?

01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:22.994
In the Committee office.

01:16:29.334 --> 01:16:30.710
How you got it figured?

01:16:31.003 --> 01:16:32.503
Okay.

01:16:32.796 --> 01:16:34.630
Right out this door to the right
is Michael.

01:16:34.923 --> 01:16:36.215
There's a crowd there.
If we run through the crowd,

01:16:36.508 --> 01:16:38.884
they'll come unglued,
and right to the right again,

01:16:39.177 --> 01:16:42.179
big doors... through the doors,
we have help outside.

01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:53.316
Don't panic.

01:16:55.777 --> 01:16:59.238
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way, you fools!

01:16:59.531 --> 01:17:00.531
God damn it.

01:17:00.824 --> 01:17:06.078
Another helpful hint for living
from the Committee's almanac.

01:17:12.044 --> 01:17:13.544
The guns are to the right.

01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:17.381
Come on, what happened?

01:17:17.674 --> 01:17:18.758
Well, how'd it come out?

01:17:19.051 --> 01:17:20.491
They folded, like I said they would.

01:17:20.552 --> 01:17:22.136
Hey, listen, Michael's got to be first.

01:17:22.429 --> 01:17:25.181
And Jeb, not Wilson,
or we're all in trouble.

01:17:28.226 --> 01:17:30.436
And then the faint thunder
became an uproar.

01:17:30.729 --> 01:17:32.563
The winds changed
to a great vibration of air.

01:17:32.856 --> 01:17:35.775
Then Lou, then Mez.

01:17:36.068 --> 01:17:39.612
Then Doc. But kill Lou first,
'cause he's the important one.

01:17:39.905 --> 01:17:41.864
Where you going?
The church is this way.

01:17:42.157 --> 01:17:43.616
Hey, we got to get them
when they're together.

01:17:43.909 --> 01:17:46.029
- Where you going?
- I'm getting the hell out of here.

01:17:46.078 --> 01:17:47.119
I want to see Blood again.

01:17:47.412 --> 01:17:48.621
I want to get in a good,
straightforward fight

01:17:48.914 --> 01:17:51.123
with some sonofabitch
over a can of beans.

01:17:51.416 --> 01:17:53.292
I gotta get back in the dirt
so I feel clean!

01:17:53.585 --> 01:17:55.294
Wait a minute. Helping you
has put us out into the open.

01:17:55.587 --> 01:17:56.962
- You've got to help us.
- Good luck, baby.

01:17:57.255 --> 01:18:01.926
Vic, please. You dirty, filthy,
stinking, rotten animal!

01:18:02.219 --> 01:18:03.302
You stupid animal!

01:18:03.595 --> 01:18:05.471
You think I'd let you
slobber all over me

01:18:05.764 --> 01:18:08.057
and paw me
so's you could walk out now?

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:10.350
I didn't bring you down here
so they could use you.

01:18:10.477 --> 01:18:12.645
I brought you down here
so I could use you.

01:18:12.938 --> 01:18:15.231
Now, you better kill them,
then I don't care what you do!

01:18:19.653 --> 01:18:21.404
Please! No, don't!
Please don't!

01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:23.322
Please help me!
I love you, I love you!

01:18:23.615 --> 01:18:26.742
I only said that because
you were going to leave me.

01:18:27.035 --> 01:18:28.244
Please, Vic!

01:18:28.537 --> 01:18:32.832
12-inch skillets, preferably
of the non-stick variety.

01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:37.336
Fry the bacon until brown,
but not too crisp,

01:18:37.629 --> 01:18:40.339
then set it aside to drain.

01:18:40.632 --> 01:18:42.032
Pour off all but two tablespoons...

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:43.634
I don't understand you.

01:18:43.927 --> 01:18:47.346
All you can think about is going
back up there, and about your dog.

01:18:48.432 --> 01:18:51.350
It's like all the time we spent together
didn't mean anything to you.

01:18:54.312 --> 01:18:56.856
Vic, I don't see what's wrong
with staying down here

01:18:57.149 --> 01:18:58.357
and running the Committee.

01:18:58.650 --> 01:18:59.734
Add the corned beef...

01:19:00.026 --> 01:19:03.195
There they are. Kill them, Vic,
and everything down here is ours.

01:19:03.488 --> 01:19:09.201
Two tablespoons of chopped parsley
and add cream.

01:19:09.494 --> 01:19:11.871
You'd be given plenty of food,
fools to kick around.

01:19:12.164 --> 01:19:13.456
We can do whatever we please!

01:19:13.749 --> 01:19:16.709
And add salt and freshly ground
pepper to taste...

01:19:17.002 --> 01:19:18.210
Kill them, Vic, now.

01:19:18.503 --> 01:19:19.879
Red reference.

01:19:20.172 --> 01:19:23.883
Repeat: Red... red reference.

01:19:24.176 --> 01:19:26.343
For us.

01:19:26.636 --> 01:19:28.888
The Committee.

01:19:29.181 --> 01:19:30.890
- Do it!
- The Committee...

01:19:31.183 --> 01:19:33.392
sitting in extraordinary session,

01:19:33.685 --> 01:19:35.436
11:37 a.m.,

01:19:35.729 --> 01:19:38.397
July 4, Year of Our Lord
one-aught-three,

01:19:38.690 --> 01:19:39.732
all present.

01:19:42.527 --> 01:19:45.613
Bestow upon the Committee,
thy servants of the seal,

01:19:45.906 --> 01:19:48.908
thine approval
and thy fatherly benediction,

01:19:49.201 --> 01:19:52.161
granting unto them grace to fulfill
with pure and steadfast affection

01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:55.831
the ordinances and the laws
of the State of Topeka.

01:19:57.042 --> 01:19:58.417
Amen.

01:19:58.710 --> 01:20:01.128
You have ignored several warnings by us

01:20:01.421 --> 01:20:03.088
informed of the rules that are vital

01:20:03.381 --> 01:20:06.884
to the continued growth
and well-being of our beloved Topeka.

01:20:08.929 --> 01:20:11.347
And ordained by the people
cannot be tolerated.

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:14.058
- Quilla June.
- Quilla June Holmes.

01:20:14.351 --> 01:20:17.102
Number 2,644.

01:20:17.395 --> 01:20:20.064
Lack of respect, wrong attitude,
failure to obey authority.

01:20:20.357 --> 01:20:21.732
How say you one and all?

01:20:22.025 --> 01:20:23.067
- Aye.
- Aye.

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:25.402
- Aye.
- The Farm, immediately.

01:20:25.695 --> 01:20:26.862
Gery.

01:20:27.155 --> 01:20:30.491
Gery Leroy Franklin,
number 2,598.

01:20:30.784 --> 01:20:33.369
Lack of respect, wrong attitude,
failure to obey authority.

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:35.120
How say you one and all?

01:20:35.413 --> 01:20:37.289
- Aye.
- Aye.

01:20:37.582 --> 01:20:38.541
The Farm, immediately.

01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:40.459
Richard.

01:20:42.295 --> 01:20:44.046
Number 2,601.

01:20:45.257 --> 01:20:47.258
All right.

01:20:47.551 --> 01:20:49.760
Vic, I'll show you the way out.
Let's get out of here.

01:20:50.053 --> 01:20:52.513
- Vic.
- The Farm, immediately.

01:20:52.806 --> 01:20:55.326
I'll show you the way out.
All right, I'll show you the way out.

01:20:55.475 --> 01:20:58.519
- Kenneth.
- Please, let's just get out of here.

01:20:58.812 --> 01:21:00.312
I'll take care of you and Blood.

01:21:00.605 --> 01:21:02.231
I'll do anything you want to do.

01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:04.525
Vic, remember in the boiler room?

01:21:04.818 --> 01:21:06.986
Wrong attitude,
failure to obey authority.

01:21:07.279 --> 01:21:08.404
How say you one and all?

01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:10.072
Aye.

01:21:10.365 --> 01:21:12.449
First thing that boy's ever done.

01:21:15.662 --> 01:21:17.329
A shame.

01:21:17.622 --> 01:21:20.124
Vic, please, let's get out of here.

01:21:20.417 --> 01:21:22.960
Same. Farm. Immediately.

01:21:23.253 --> 01:21:25.921
And may God have mercy on your soul.

01:21:27.257 --> 01:21:30.050
Heat the bacon fat
reserved in the skillet.

01:21:30.343 --> 01:21:33.470
Add the hash, and with a spatula,
spread evenly...

01:21:37.017 --> 01:21:39.184
Cook uncovered over moderate heat

01:21:39.477 --> 01:21:41.353
for 35 to 40 minutes,

01:21:41.646 --> 01:21:45.441
scraping the pan occasionally
to prevent the hash from sticking.

01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:48.444
As it cooks, remove any excess fat

01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:52.948
from the top and sides of the pan
with a spoon or bulb baster.

01:21:53.241 --> 01:21:55.784
Kill him! Oh, please, kill him!

01:22:05.879 --> 01:22:07.588
Vic, kill him!

01:22:09.674 --> 01:22:14.678
Number two-six-aught-one,
and Gery Leroy Franklin...

01:22:16.056 --> 01:22:18.223
Let's get on with it. Jack?

01:22:20.352 --> 01:22:23.646
Of the 35 proposed recipients,
10 have been serviced.

01:22:26.775 --> 01:22:28.096
We need another donor, of course.

01:22:29.402 --> 01:22:33.280
What's wrong? Why don't you
kill him, Vic?

01:22:33.573 --> 01:22:35.240
Put the search program
back in effect.

01:22:41.706 --> 01:22:44.066
Scratch the boy's name.
Concentrate on the rest of the list.

01:22:44.209 --> 01:22:48.921
Whichever one we pick,
make sure we have better security.

01:22:49.214 --> 01:22:51.757
Then place a large round
platter over the skillet

01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:54.593
and, gripping platter
and skillet firmly together...

01:22:54.886 --> 01:22:57.054
Stop him, Vic, stop him.

01:23:00.558 --> 01:23:05.104
If any of the hash sticks to the pan,
lift it up with the spatula...

01:23:05.397 --> 01:23:08.190
We've got to keep him in check.

01:23:08.483 --> 01:23:11.777
Now, I've been talking and talking
and talking about this, and...

01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:15.406
and serve with poached eggs,
if desired.

01:23:22.247 --> 01:23:25.082
Come on! Come on, Vic, come on!

01:23:27.544 --> 01:23:29.044
Hurry!

01:23:33.049 --> 01:23:34.466
One cup diced, cooked vegetables...

01:23:34.759 --> 01:23:39.304
Let's... get another Michael
out of the warehouse.

01:23:39.597 --> 01:23:41.438
This time, make sure
the engineering department

01:23:41.599 --> 01:23:43.600
wipes that smile off his face.

01:23:43.893 --> 01:23:47.896
Four tablespoons of
finely chopped fresh parsley...

01:23:49.107 --> 01:23:51.817
one quarter cup heavy cream,

01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:53.318
salt,

01:23:53.611 --> 01:23:57.781
and freshly ground, black pepper.

01:24:20.472 --> 01:24:21.847
Blood?

01:24:23.475 --> 01:24:24.641
Blood!

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:30.481
You kept me down there too long.

01:24:32.484 --> 01:24:34.359
Come on with me, let's go.

01:24:34.652 --> 01:24:39.364
Over The Hill, that's where he went,
and we need him.

01:24:39.657 --> 01:24:41.283
Well, let's catch up with him.

01:24:41.576 --> 01:24:43.577
I don't know where it is.

01:24:44.996 --> 01:24:46.516
If Blood knows,
why didn't he tell you?

01:24:46.664 --> 01:24:47.831
Vic!

01:24:52.003 --> 01:24:53.170
Blood.

01:24:54.464 --> 01:24:55.631
Vic!

01:24:57.175 --> 01:24:58.342
Blood?

01:25:20.198 --> 01:25:22.616
- Blood!
- Hello, partner.

01:25:22.909 --> 01:25:23.992
Blood, we made it back.

01:25:24.285 --> 01:25:25.953
Who's your new tailor, Albert?

01:25:35.088 --> 01:25:36.922
How long's it been since you ate?

01:25:37.215 --> 01:25:40.425
I grabbed a lizard yesterday.

01:25:40.718 --> 01:25:44.096
Maybe it was the day before.
I can't seem to remember.

01:25:45.890 --> 01:25:48.809
Well, we got to leg it into town
and get you something to eat fast.

01:25:49.102 --> 01:25:52.020
No, Fellini's taken everything over.

01:25:52.313 --> 01:25:55.149
Slaughtered every solo
who wouldn't join him.

01:25:55.441 --> 01:25:57.025
The whole town's under their control.

01:25:57.318 --> 01:25:58.735
You can't get any food there.

01:25:59.028 --> 01:26:00.863
You can't even go back at all.

01:26:01.948 --> 01:26:03.365
Okay, just take it easy.

01:26:03.658 --> 01:26:05.075
I can't take it any other way.

01:26:05.368 --> 01:26:06.451
I'm almost gone.

01:26:06.744 --> 01:26:09.184
You'd better just leave and find
someplace you can stay alive.

01:26:12.750 --> 01:26:14.585
How about Over The Hill, Tiger?

01:26:14.878 --> 01:26:16.211
I can't make it the way I am now.

01:26:16.504 --> 01:26:18.839
But you might be able to.

01:26:23.428 --> 01:26:25.137
He needs food
and he needs medicine.

01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:28.473
We've got to get it fast,
'cause we can't make it without him.

01:26:28.766 --> 01:26:30.767
We're too late, darling.

01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:34.771
There's nothing
we can do about it now.

01:26:41.946 --> 01:26:43.947
Vic, we've got to get out of here.

01:26:52.123 --> 01:26:54.791
We're gonna be together.
He'd want us to be together.

01:27:02.467 --> 01:27:04.301
Now, I love you.

01:27:12.810 --> 01:27:14.811
If you love me, you'll come on, too.

01:27:31.829 --> 01:27:33.497
You haven't eaten a bite.

01:27:34.832 --> 01:27:36.333
I'm not hungry.

01:27:41.839 --> 01:27:44.675
I really appreciate this.

01:27:49.681 --> 01:27:52.849
Well, let's press on.

01:27:56.187 --> 01:27:57.729
Now, where were you?

01:27:58.022 --> 01:27:59.731
Oh, yes, in the hospital.

01:28:00.024 --> 01:28:01.566
Oh, Blood, come on.

01:28:01.859 --> 01:28:04.736
You know, if they'd just let you
have your way with the blushing brides

01:28:05.029 --> 01:28:06.905
instead of hooking you up
to a machine,

01:28:07.198 --> 01:28:09.700
you'd probably never come back up!

01:28:15.039 --> 01:28:16.915
You sure you had enough to eat?

01:28:17.208 --> 01:28:18.709
Oh, yes.

01:28:20.044 --> 01:28:21.753
- I'm satiated.
- What?

01:28:22.046 --> 01:28:25.257
Nothing, I said I'm full,
but after we walk all day,

01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:27.384
you'll probably have to
cook up what's left.

01:28:30.138 --> 01:28:31.471
She said she loved me.

01:28:33.182 --> 01:28:34.766
Oh, hell, it wasn't my fault

01:28:35.059 --> 01:28:37.060
she picked me to get all
wet-brained over.

01:28:39.564 --> 01:28:42.190
Well, I'd say she certainly had
marvelous judgment, Albert,

01:28:42.483 --> 01:28:45.819
If not particularly good taste!

01:28:47.989 --> 01:28:49.823
Particularly good!
