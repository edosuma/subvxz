01:57.492 --> 01:59.661
do you know there's a boat
out there where nothing sucks?

01:59.744 --> 02:01.204
It's called Royalty Cruises,

02:01.287 --> 02:03.081
and Royalty Cruise specialists
are standing by now!

02:03.164 --> 02:05.625
(grunts) I'm sorry, sweetie.

02:05.708 --> 02:08.378
Maybe we could afford
a vacation if some big shot

02:08.461 --> 02:11.506
didn't pick up the tab
for his buddies at Mr. Steak.

02:11.589 --> 02:13.883

02:13.967 --> 02:16.511
Do you know
why I go to Mr. Steak?

Because at Mr. Steak,
they don't get mad at me

02:20.265 --> 02:22.976
for spending a lot of money
at Mr. Steak!

02:23.059 --> 02:24.811

02:24.894 --> 02:26.646
Why don't you talk

There is no Mrs. Steak!

02:30.024 --> 02:32.235
Okay, maybe I can pay
for the cruise.

02:32.318 --> 02:35.613
Let's see how much it costs
for a cabin on a low deck.

02:36.698 --> 02:40.827
No porthole...
group Z lifeboat access...

02:40.910 --> 02:43.997
Aw, it's still a ton of money.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.498
Face it, we're just kids.

02:45.582 --> 02:47.876
We can't afford stuff
with zeroes in the prices.

02:47.959 --> 02:51.421
All we have in the world
are the things our parents give us.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.423
Hmm...

02:54.632 --> 02:57.177
Bart! There's a really mean
squirrel in the backyard.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.970
I need you to dare me
to fight him!

02:59.053 --> 03:00.430
(gasps) Huh?!

03:00.513 --> 03:04.142
Bart's been raptured!
And his crap's been crap-tured!

03:05.810 --> 03:07.353
(grunts)

03:09.314 --> 03:11.316
Ah...

03:15.236 --> 03:18.573
Why do you want
a box of Bart's baby teeth?

03:18.656 --> 03:22.577

and I ain't "Tums Rich."

03:22.660 --> 03:25.246

03:26.456 --> 03:29.042
(groans) I sold all my stuff,

03:29.125 --> 03:31.169
and it's still not enough money
for the cruise.

03:31.252 --> 03:33.504
Just try to enjoy
your dinner, sweetie.

03:33.588 --> 03:36.007
I can't, I sold
my "dinner futures."

03:36.090 --> 03:38.635
Nice doing business
with you, boy. (laughs)

03:38.718 --> 03:40.053

03:40.136 --> 03:41.596

03:41.679 --> 03:43.932
It's okay. I don't have

BART:
Mom! Dad!

03:52.690 --> 03:54.442
I woke up
and the money jar was full!

03:54.525 --> 03:56.361
That means the devil
accepted my bargain.

03:56.444 --> 03:58.696
Now, to uphold
my end of the deal!

03:58.780 --> 04:01.199
-Snowball II!
-No!

04:01.282 --> 04:03.785
We saw how much
this cruise means to you,

04:03.868 --> 04:05.995
so we all
sold something special.

04:06.079 --> 04:09.040
And we made just enough
for an economy cabin!

04:09.123 --> 04:11.542
I sold a couple of my
rare jazz records.

04:11.626 --> 04:14.003
After a while they all
start to sound the same.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.838
(chuckles)
Still love the genre, of course.

04:15.922 --> 04:18.633
Not even close
to getting sick of it.

04:18.716 --> 04:21.135
And I sold our good china.

04:21.219 --> 04:22.553
Really?!

04:22.637 --> 04:24.973
But that's been in your family
for generations.

04:25.056 --> 04:26.432
Yeah...

04:26.516 --> 04:30.019
actually, my mom stole it
from a woman she cleaned for.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.063
Took her years
to get the whole set.

04:32.146 --> 04:33.982
And Dad donated
something, too.

04:34.065 --> 04:36.150
What happened
to my mini-pool table?!

04:36.234 --> 04:38.987
I was training
to be a mini-pool hustler.

04:39.070 --> 04:42.156
We sold it
to pay for a family cruise.

04:42.240 --> 04:46.411
I never even got to realize
this jacket was too small.

04:46.494 --> 04:48.997
It's weird to hear
myself saying this, but...

04:49.080 --> 04:50.081
I love you guys.

04:50.164 --> 04:53.001
This is going to be
the best vacation ever!

04:53.084 --> 04:54.961
Yeah, for you kids, maybe.

04:55.044 --> 04:59.590
For dads, a family vacation
is a 24-hour-a-day babysitting job.

04:59.674 --> 05:01.301
"Are you wearing
enough sun block?"

05:01.384 --> 05:03.344
"Is that splashing or drowning?"

05:03.428 --> 05:07.598
"Why does every sand castle
require my participation?"

05:07.682 --> 05:10.601
Then a kid disappears,
and it's total panic

05:10.685 --> 05:12.687
until you find him
at the swim-up bar...

05:12.770 --> 05:15.064
...eating a 30-dollar cheeseburger,

05:15.148 --> 05:17.525
which he drops in the water!

05:17.608 --> 05:20.737
And here's the worst part:
I never get anytime alone

05:20.820 --> 05:24.699
with my wife because we're all
sleeping in the same room!

05:24.782 --> 05:26.701

12:03.097 --> 12:03.973
(monitor flatlines)

12:04.056 --> 12:07.059
Haw-haw!

12:07.143 --> 12:08.936
(monitor flatlines)

12:09.019 --> 12:12.606
Why can't vacation last forever?

12:12.690 --> 12:15.401
I've got to do something.

12:15.484 --> 12:16.527
(gunshot)

12:16.610 --> 12:17.528
Sorry.

12:19.113 --> 12:21.323
(people chattering)

12:23.576 --> 12:26.078
There's something I see

12:26.162 --> 12:28.873
that's even more beautiful
than Ganymede, Lisa.

12:28.956 --> 12:30.624
I... Oh.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.251
That's right, Io.

12:32.334 --> 12:36.797
But no moon of Jupiter
is as beautiful as you.

12:36.881 --> 12:38.007
Oh.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.285

13:50.412 --> 13:52.081
Our attempts
to contact the mainland

13:52.164 --> 13:53.958
have met with nothing
but static.

13:54.041 --> 13:56.877
It appears we have no choice--
to avoid the virus,

13:56.961 --> 14:00.548
we must remain at sea
indefinitely.

15:49.323 --> 15:51.158
If it wasn't
for this virus thing,

15:51.241 --> 15:52.743
we'd all be back
at our old sucky lives.

15:52.826 --> 15:56.705
And, instead, you're here, where you
can be lovey-dovey all the time.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.415
Come on, kiss.

15:58.499 --> 15:59.750
Kiss!

Bart, we're too worried
to enjoy each other's mouths.

16:03.587 --> 16:06.006
Yeah, and the customer
service on this cruise

16:06.090 --> 16:07.424
has really gone downhill.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.593
Drop dead, fat-ass!

16:11.095 --> 16:13.889
Last week, that steward
brought me extra shampoo.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.183
He called me "lovely lady."

16:16.266 --> 16:19.228
Hey, Lis, at least you nerds
are still geekin' it up.

16:19.311 --> 16:21.981
What could be sweeter than
a vacation that never ends?

16:22.064 --> 16:23.732
Sweet? Sweet?!

16:23.816 --> 16:24.900
The passengers on this ship

16:24.984 --> 16:26.568
could be the last people
on earth.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.237
Like monks during
the Dark Ages,

16:28.320 --> 16:29.905
it's up to the KidZone: Elite

16:29.989 --> 16:32.157
to make a record
of human culture.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.784
This group is adapting
children's classics

16:33.867 --> 16:37.579
for the stage to entertain
generations of survivors.

16:37.663 --> 16:40.249
Erik, we must work
with the humans.

16:40.332 --> 16:42.418
You are so naive, Charles.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.837
We should rule them
as conquerors.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.799
Can't anybody enjoy
their forever vacation?

16:48.882 --> 16:50.009
(grunts angrily)

16:50.092 --> 16:51.593
Check it out!
The gallery was gonna

16:51.677 --> 16:52.928
throw these paintings overboard,

16:53.012 --> 16:55.431
like they were
worthless garbage.

16:55.514 --> 16:57.558
Bart, glad you're here.

16:57.641 --> 16:59.768
We're all gonna watch
a movie together.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.145
Yeah, a movie!

17:01.228 --> 17:04.440
It is about time you guys
started having some fun.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.985
Humanity must endure.

17:08.068 --> 17:09.862
General, it's worse
than we thought.

17:09.945 --> 17:11.071
The virus is getting bigger.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.197

17:15.034 --> 17:16.535
Bart, how could you?

17:16.618 --> 17:18.037
Uh, got to go!

17:18.120 --> 17:22.082
Man, I kicked butt
in the gladiator arena today.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.793
I won the last package
of hot dogs on the ship.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.629
I got robbed by marauders
on the way home.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.465
There is no virus!

17:29.548 --> 17:31.967
Bart faked the whole thing
with a DVD.

17:32.051 --> 17:35.137
A direct-to-video DVD.

17:35.220 --> 17:38.766
You stand accused
of letting down your team

17:38.849 --> 17:40.225
during music trivia.

17:40.309 --> 17:44.938
Your fun-ishment: eight hours
in the penal conga line.

17:45.022 --> 17:45.898

17:45.981 --> 17:49.151

17:49.234 --> 17:52.071
Excuse me,
Cruise Director Priddis.

17:52.154 --> 17:54.156
My son has something
to tell you.

17:54.239 --> 17:57.242
Speak, passenger,
son of passenger.

17:57.326 --> 17:59.411
It was all a hoax;
there's no virus.

17:59.495 --> 18:00.537
(crowd gasps)

18:00.621 --> 18:02.498
But the warning from the general!

18:02.581 --> 18:05.167
That was just Treat Williams
in a virus movie.

18:05.250 --> 18:08.003
You know, I thought
that general looked familiar.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.672
What?
I'm in a lot of movies.

18:10.756 --> 18:14.259
(Simpsons gasping,
crowd grumbling)

18:14.343 --> 18:17.054
I take back everything
I said to you

18:17.137 --> 18:19.431
that night in the dolphin lab.

18:19.515 --> 18:20.432
(gasps)

18:20.516 --> 18:23.018
All that happened is we got
a little extra vacation.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.228
Is that so bad?

18:24.311 --> 18:26.313
MAN:
I think I ate people meat!

18:26.396 --> 18:27.356
(groans)

18:27.439 --> 18:29.233
I know my son
did a terrible thing.

18:29.316 --> 18:31.401
But there's a chapel
on this ship,

18:31.485 --> 18:33.445
and in that chapel
there's a book,

18:33.529 --> 18:36.532
and it says,
"Judge not, lest ye..."

18:36.615 --> 18:38.450
(groans)

18:38.534 --> 18:39.993
After this,
I'll be lucky to get work

18:40.077 --> 18:43.038
on a clothing-optional
Jimmy Buffett cruise!

18:43.122 --> 18:45.624
What about the duty-free
stuff we bought?

18:45.707 --> 18:47.960
"Never have fun!"

18:48.043 --> 18:50.045
My booze and cologne!

18:51.088 --> 18:53.340
(grunting worriedly)

18:55.843 --> 18:58.637
(humming)

19:06.019 --> 19:07.688
That's fair.

19:07.771 --> 19:10.566
Sorry.
I deserve it.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.776
Ow! That one really hurt.

19:12.860 --> 19:16.613
Sorry, sweetie, I just needed
to get that out of my system.

19:16.697 --> 19:20.284
This stupid prank is the most
selfish thing you've ever done!

19:20.367 --> 19:22.369
I wasn't being selfish.

19:22.452 --> 19:24.705
I did it for you guys, too.

19:24.788 --> 19:27.291
Lisa, you made friends
with kids just like you.

19:27.374 --> 19:30.961
Mom and Dad, you were more happy
and in love than I ever saw you.

19:31.044 --> 19:33.380
It was the best week
of all of our lives,

19:33.463 --> 19:35.966
-and I wanted it to last forever.

blue hands!

19:40.137 --> 19:41.930
Oh... what the...

19:44.016 --> 19:45.642
LISA:
Hey, up here!

19:45.726 --> 19:46.977
You got to see this!

19:48.020 --> 19:49.771
ALL:
Ooh!

19:49.855 --> 19:52.691
LISA:
From egg to baby to grown-up,

19:52.774 --> 19:54.067
we can see them living

19:54.151 --> 19:56.028
their entire penguin lives
from up here.

19:56.111 --> 19:57.571
(crackling)

19:57.654 --> 19:58.864
(chirping)

19:58.947 --> 20:00.490
BART:
What a load of crap.

20:00.574 --> 20:03.702
They spend all their time
trying to raise a baby, and why?

20:03.785 --> 20:06.830
So it can grow up
and do the same dumb thing,

20:06.914 --> 20:08.373
on and on forever.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.250
The penguin's life isn't all bad.

20:10.334 --> 20:11.960
Those ones are having a blast.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.216
But the slide's
just like our cruise:

20:17.299 --> 20:18.967
a short awesome thing
that just shows you

20:19.051 --> 20:21.094
how boring the rest
of your life is.

20:21.178 --> 20:23.764
Well, sure,
life is full of pain and drudgery,

20:23.847 --> 20:26.934
but the trick is to enjoy
the few perfect experiences

20:27.017 --> 20:28.685
we're given in the moment.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.229
Yeah, stupid.

20:30.312 --> 20:33.565
Stop thinking about fun
and have it!
