00:22.717 --> 00:24.427
Unit 40 requesting assistance.

00:24.635 --> 00:27.723
211 at the Valley Trust Bank...

00:27.890 --> 00:30.101
We have shots fired.

00:30.310 --> 00:32.103
All units, officer needs assistance.

00:32.311 --> 00:35.775
Trust Bank. Shots have been fired.

00:35.983 --> 00:39.070
We're pinned by automatic gunfire.

00:44.577 --> 00:45.828
... to get the officer up?

00:45.995 --> 00:49.166
Nothing we have can stop them.

00:49.333 --> 00:55.131
2 or 3 suspects inside.

00:56.341 --> 00:58.260
Shots being fired!

01:06.520 --> 01:09.690
and wearing body armor.

01:09.857 --> 01:12.026
Get more officers.

01:13.362 --> 01:15.239
Officer down! Officer down!

01:15.406 --> 01:17.951
Requesting SWAT. Code Three.

01:18.118 --> 01:21.664
I'm killing whoever moves!
You move, I'm killing you!

01:21.872 --> 01:24.333
What are you looking at?
What are you looking at?

01:35.138 --> 01:37.558
SWAT's just arrived.

01:37.725 --> 01:40.185
- We're 30 seconds out, boys.
- All right.

01:40.353 --> 01:43.648
dressed in heavy body armor.

01:43.815 --> 01:45.359
Let's rock 'n' roll.

02:46.642 --> 02:48.310
This is a table.

02:48.477 --> 02:50.604
We have four cameras
over the tellers.

02:51.272 --> 02:52.816
- Do we have a visual?
- Almost.

02:52.982 --> 02:54.442
- We cut their phones?
- Yes, sir.

02:54.609 --> 02:56.445
Soon as you get tapped in,
let me have it.

03:15.176 --> 03:17.303
position three.

03:39.956 --> 03:42.501
in the driver-side door.

03:42.710 --> 03:44.044
Do not let them get mobile.

03:47.174 --> 03:50.719
- He's down.
- Goddamn it! They got Bob!

03:50.886 --> 03:53.222
Grab somebody! Grab somebody
and bring them up here!

03:53.389 --> 03:54.599
- Get up.
- No.

03:54.766 --> 03:55.767
- I said, get up!
- No!

03:55.933 --> 03:58.187
Throw a body out there,
tell them we mean business!

04:04.986 --> 04:07.615
Street, 10-David. Storeroom is clear.

04:07.782 --> 04:09.200
Almost to the lobby.

04:09.366 --> 04:10.952
Shut up!

04:12.245 --> 04:14.456
Hold your position.

04:14.623 --> 04:17.793
- 10-David wants us to hold.
- Goddamn it! Goddamn it!

04:17.959 --> 04:21.130
We hold, they die.

04:24.844 --> 04:26.137
I guess we're not holding.

04:26.304 --> 04:28.556
I swear to God,
I'm gonna kill somebody!

05:07.563 --> 05:09.273
Take a headshot.

05:15.113 --> 05:17.992
They just capped E ddie! How the hell
we gonna get out of here?

05:18.159 --> 05:19.910
Shut up, I'm thinking!

05:24.749 --> 05:29.297
sending in a secure phone.

05:42.396 --> 05:44.106
Please.

05:46.109 --> 05:49.322
Stop whining! I'll put a bullet
in your head!

05:52.533 --> 05:54.286
Shut up!

05:55.621 --> 05:57.539
What are they doing?

06:01.628 --> 06:04.548
This is Rick from the L.A.P.D.
Can you hear me okay?

06:04.715 --> 06:08.220
position. CNT has him on the phone.

06:08.386 --> 06:11.556
10-David to the 1-4 corner.
Confirm that you have containment.

06:11.723 --> 06:13.559
Roger, we're holding
on the 1-4 corner.

06:13.726 --> 06:17.856
Confirm that you're holding.

06:18.982 --> 06:21.902
- We're holding top of stairwell.
- Shut up.

06:22.070 --> 06:24.864
Gamble, Street, where are you?
Why aren't you responding?

06:25.073 --> 06:26.324
Let's be cool. Calm down.

06:26.491 --> 06:29.829
I'm controlling this situation!
You understand me?

06:30.746 --> 06:32.374
- Please.
- We need to go!

06:35.001 --> 06:36.838
No, please. Somebody...

06:39.757 --> 06:41.927
Help me. Help me.

06:42.094 --> 06:44.888
Gamble, Street, why aren't you
responding? Now!

07:07.958 --> 07:09.752
Oh, God!

07:09.919 --> 07:12.297
Kill that bitch and throw her out front!

07:12.464 --> 07:14.592
Get that guy off our fence!

07:14.758 --> 07:17.887
I said to kill that bitch
and throw her out front!

07:18.053 --> 07:19.806
I'm on TV!

07:44.336 --> 07:46.505
Street, 10-David. Lobby is clear.

07:46.672 --> 07:48.174
Two suspects are neutralized.

07:48.341 --> 07:50.968
I need an RA unit
for a gunshot wound to a hostage.

07:59.312 --> 08:02.483
You're gonna be fine, ma'am.
Ambulance is on the way.

08:02.691 --> 08:04.860
Got them, right?

08:08.698 --> 08:10.493
Jimbo?

08:11.077 --> 08:13.830
- She'll be okay?
- I'm not a doctor.

08:17.876 --> 08:20.839
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine.

08:31.184 --> 08:33.770
Boss is gonna tear you guys
a new one, huh?

08:33.938 --> 08:36.982
Same place he did the last time,
time before that.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.402
Good luck.

08:38.568 --> 08:40.445
I don't care what they say.

08:40.611 --> 08:43.032
You guys were heroes out there.

08:45.285 --> 08:47.788
That was some cocky shit out there.

08:53.962 --> 08:56.298
You know how to play this, right?

08:58.050 --> 08:59.886
That woman is alive
because of what we did.

09:00.094 --> 09:02.264
Yeah, alive and suing the city
for millions.

09:02.556 --> 09:04.683
Chief says if he pays,
somebody else does too...

09:04.850 --> 09:06.436
...and it sure isn't gonna be me.

09:06.603 --> 09:09.105
- Fuller, we get two seconds to make...
- Capt. Fuller!

09:09.272 --> 09:11.734
Capt. Fuller, we get two seconds
to make a decision.

09:11.901 --> 09:14.111
You get two months to sit there
and tear it apart.

09:14.278 --> 09:16.656
SWAT means "Special Weapons
And Tactics."

09:16.823 --> 09:18.575
Where were your tactics out there?

09:18.783 --> 09:21.537
Saving a woman from getting shot.
That's where they were.

09:21.704 --> 09:23.414
Every cop knows
we did the right thing.

09:23.581 --> 09:26.376
Sometimes doing the right thing
isn't doing the right thing.

09:26.543 --> 09:29.254
- What the hell does that mean?
- Sergeant.

09:31.633 --> 09:34.929
You disobeyed a direct order.
End of story. You're both off SWAT.

09:35.095 --> 09:36.555
They're two of our best officers.

09:36.764 --> 09:39.351
I'm not sticking them in the field
after a stunt like that.

09:39.518 --> 09:41.770
Sorry, I didn't know that saving lives
was a stunt.

09:41.978 --> 09:44.774
You got a big mouth,
and you're quick on the trigger...

09:44.941 --> 09:46.943
...and that is why your ass
is in a sling.

09:47.151 --> 09:50.948
If you're gonna put them off SWAT,
at least keep them in the division.

09:51.114 --> 09:53.868
Give them a shot at getting back.

10:00.501 --> 10:02.921
Stick them in the gun cage.
Get them out of my sight.

10:03.505 --> 10:06.091
- Gun cage?
- This is total bullshit.

10:06.258 --> 10:07.677
- What?
- I said, this is bullshit.

10:07.844 --> 10:08.845
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:09.011 --> 10:13.392
You should consider yourself lucky
Lt. Velasquez is standing up for you.

10:13.559 --> 10:15.769
I'm lucky I don't work
for an asshole like you.

10:15.936 --> 10:18.439
That's it! You're out of here, Gamble!
You're gone!

10:18.606 --> 10:20.149
- Control yourself!
- Get out of here!

10:20.358 --> 10:22.570
- What the hell's the matter with you?
- Street!

10:23.237 --> 10:25.739
- You stay.
- Hey!

10:29.411 --> 10:31.414
Give us a minute.

10:36.378 --> 10:38.005
Please, sit down.

10:38.213 --> 10:39.840
I'll stand.

10:43.386 --> 10:44.679
Look, Jim...

10:45.222 --> 10:48.684
...we both know that Gamble is a bad
influence on the rest of the team.

10:48.893 --> 10:50.770
Gamble's a good cop.

10:50.937 --> 10:53.690
Unlike him, you still have a chance
at a future here.

10:53.899 --> 10:56.194
You go on record that Gamble
acted recklessly...

10:56.360 --> 10:59.406
...and you had to follow your partner in
after he disobeyed orders...

10:59.573 --> 11:02.701
...and I will make sure that you are
back on SWAT tomorrow morning.

11:07.248 --> 11:09.835
Let's get the hell out of here.

11:10.002 --> 11:12.171
I need a cocktail.

11:14.508 --> 11:16.510
I'm staying.

11:18.095 --> 11:21.682
You're what? What...?

11:22.016 --> 11:23.685
- After that?
- Couple months...

11:23.852 --> 11:27.565
...Fuller will find new asses to
chew out. We'll be back on the team.

11:27.774 --> 11:32.071
Fuller is the cockroach
of this department, brother.

11:32.279 --> 11:33.948
He's not gonna give us
a second chance.

11:34.114 --> 11:38.036
What are you gonna do? Piss away
all the hard work you did to get here?

11:39.037 --> 11:41.373
Piss what away, Jimmy?

11:41.624 --> 11:43.209
The cage?

11:43.376 --> 11:45.586
Come on, man.

11:45.795 --> 11:48.090
We're better than that,
and you know it.

11:48.465 --> 11:50.592
You gonna come with me?

11:58.060 --> 12:00.647
A real partner wouldn't have
to ask that, would he?

12:00.814 --> 12:03.984
A real partner would step up
to what he did in the bank.

12:04.860 --> 12:07.738
- Yeah. I saved the hostage.
- You disobeyed the hold.

12:07.905 --> 12:11.076
- No, I saved that hostage!
- You disobeyed the hold!

12:12.327 --> 12:13.912
You made the decision yourself.

12:14.079 --> 12:16.708
And you shot a hostage.
Jesus, Brian!

12:20.671 --> 12:23.173
You sound a lot like Fuller.

12:23.507 --> 12:26.344
Is that what you two were talking
about in there?

12:27.429 --> 12:29.307
Did you rat me out?

12:29.765 --> 12:31.851
You cut a deal to get back
on the team, Jimmy?

12:32.018 --> 12:33.812
- Did I cut a deal?
- Yeah, did you?

12:33.979 --> 12:37.191
How many times have I covered up
for one of your goddamn stunts?

12:38.109 --> 12:40.695
That's what a partner's
supposed to do.

12:43.032 --> 12:45.618
You just picked a paycheck
over me, bro.

12:45.784 --> 12:48.538
You just picked yourself
over everything else.

12:49.289 --> 12:52.376
You want to stay here
and be Fuller's bitch...

12:52.543 --> 12:55.379
...you go right ahead.
I can't do it.

12:55.546 --> 12:57.382
I can't do it.

12:57.549 --> 12:59.968
Damn it. Goddamn it.
Goddamn it, Jim!

13:00.135 --> 13:04.224
Partners for five years.
This is how you want to end it.

13:06.560 --> 13:08.687
I didn't end it.

13:11.525 --> 13:13.902
You sold me out to the brass.

13:14.736 --> 13:18.241
You know, I never realized till now
how full of shit you are.

13:26.042 --> 13:29.420
Fuck you and SWAT.

14:28.326 --> 14:31.455
- You're too attached to that soda, Gus.
- Love that stuff.

14:31.622 --> 14:35.000
The wife would have my behind
if she busted me sucking that down.

14:35.167 --> 14:37.086
Why, is she a Mr. Pibb fan?

14:37.253 --> 14:38.630
You know the deal, Jim.

14:38.796 --> 14:41.133
When we got married,
I converted to Mormonism.

14:41.300 --> 14:44.511
We can't consume anything
that alters our state of mind.

14:45.639 --> 14:48.058
We treat our bodies with respect.

14:48.225 --> 14:50.895
And I treat mine
like an amusement park.

14:51.062 --> 14:53.481
It's the differences
that make this country great.

14:53.648 --> 14:55.692
Need them cleaned
by the morning, boys.

14:57.736 --> 14:59.864
You were supposed to have
it in a half-hour ago.

15:00.031 --> 15:02.367
What, your boy gonna report me
to the captain?

15:02.533 --> 15:05.329
Just for thinking you look good
in that mustache.

15:05.537 --> 15:07.373
Your mom seems to like it, though.

15:07.539 --> 15:09.459
So does your sister.

15:11.878 --> 15:13.172
Hey, sarge, welcome back.

15:14.048 --> 15:17.009
- Look who's back.
- Welcome back, sarge.

15:17.176 --> 15:18.845
What's up, Hondo?

15:19.012 --> 15:21.098
Hey, sarge.

15:26.145 --> 15:28.857
- Howdy.
- What do you need?

15:29.066 --> 15:30.901
Sgt. Hondo? You're back.

15:31.068 --> 15:33.863
You know what they say, Gus.
You're either SWAT or you're not.

15:34.030 --> 15:35.448
Yes, sir. What can I do for you?

15:35.615 --> 15:37.201
Oh, just a tune-up.

15:37.368 --> 15:39.287
But please, don't touch my sights.

15:39.453 --> 15:42.374
- And I made some modifications...
- To the trigger too.

15:42.749 --> 15:45.544
- And you are?
- Jim Street.

15:45.753 --> 15:47.630
Street.

15:48.965 --> 15:51.051
Yeah, we'll leave them intact.

15:51.218 --> 15:54.430
- I need that back by tomorrow.
- Can do, sergeant.

15:54.763 --> 15:56.766
- Good to see you.
- Good seeing you.

15:59.979 --> 16:02.523
Gosh, Gus, is that a woody?

16:02.690 --> 16:04.860
Heck, yeah. That's Hondo.

16:05.027 --> 16:06.862
He's old-school SWAT.

16:07.029 --> 16:09.365
The gold standard of ass-kicking.

16:09.532 --> 16:12.076
Sorry, butt-kicking. I guess he's back.

16:13.369 --> 16:14.914
I guess he is.

16:15.122 --> 16:17.917
A weeklong series,
attacking us top to bottom.

16:18.125 --> 16:19.586
And it's all SWAT's fault, right?

16:19.794 --> 16:22.255
No, the chief's been pretty fair
about blaming everyone.

16:22.464 --> 16:25.259
He does want these
bad headlines to end.

16:25.468 --> 16:28.096
He wants the old warhorses to help
restore the luster.

16:28.305 --> 16:30.641
Old? I know you ain't
talking about me.

16:30.807 --> 16:33.228
You gotta shake off
that three-year rust from Rampart.

16:33.394 --> 16:35.897
- I'm throwing you in right away.
- Sooner the better.

16:36.064 --> 16:39.109
I want you to put together a young,
kick-ass element for me, Dan.

16:39.318 --> 16:41.612
You select them, you train them,
you mold them.

16:41.820 --> 16:45.283
I know you're not talking about giving
me five pups fresh out of the gate.

16:45.492 --> 16:48.120
- I didn't come back to wipe noses.
- Hell, no.

16:48.329 --> 16:50.873
Now, you worked with T.J. And Boxer
at Southwest.

16:51.040 --> 16:53.293
- You up for supervising them here?
- That's a start.

16:53.502 --> 16:57.757
Now all you have to do
is find three fresh ones.

16:57.924 --> 17:00.970
Only catch is, Fuller has
to approve the three.

17:01.136 --> 17:04.682
What did Capt. Fuller say when he
heard the chief was bringing me back?

17:04.848 --> 17:06.393
Hasn't stopped swearing since.

17:38.306 --> 17:40.809
What's your brother's truck
doing outside?

17:42.978 --> 17:45.732
We having a garage sale
I don't know about?

17:47.567 --> 17:49.778
You weren't supposed to be home
for an hour.

17:50.404 --> 17:52.907
Sorry to screw up your getaway.

17:53.742 --> 17:56.912
Look, let's not make this
a thing, okay?

17:57.413 --> 18:00.041
We both knew it was coming.

18:04.087 --> 18:07.550
It's not like we were in this
to get married, right?

18:15.017 --> 18:17.103
And you've changed since...

18:18.396 --> 18:20.565
Well, people change.

18:21.901 --> 18:25.447
Look, when it was good
it was great, right?

18:26.448 --> 18:28.450
That means something.

18:37.628 --> 18:39.798
Yeah, thanks.

18:56.109 --> 18:58.111
- Damn it!
- Hey! Hey!

18:58.279 --> 19:00.281
I'm gonna throw this thing out.

19:00.447 --> 19:02.199
Do and you die.

19:02.366 --> 19:05.036
Every SWAT team in the world's
gonna have one someday.

19:05.203 --> 19:08.124
It's 50 pounds of scrap metal.

19:08.958 --> 19:10.793
All right.

19:11.377 --> 19:13.714
Say you got some crazy suspect
barricaded in a house.

19:13.880 --> 19:16.967
- All right.
- Just chain this to the back of a truck...

19:17.552 --> 19:20.221
...shove this end
right through the wall...

19:20.388 --> 19:23.601
...these rods spring out
like fishhooks.

19:24.226 --> 19:27.897
Your partner guns the truck,
takes the whole wall with him.

19:28.064 --> 19:30.483
And we waltz right in
and surprise the bad guy, right?

19:30.650 --> 19:32.028
Correct.

19:32.194 --> 19:33.821
I call it "The Key to the City."

19:34.030 --> 19:36.241
- Patent pending.
- Is that right?

19:36.408 --> 19:38.327
Right.

19:38.827 --> 19:41.164
Let me get your M-4.

19:41.581 --> 19:43.166
And...

19:46.253 --> 19:47.963
Took the rattle out of the receiver.

19:48.505 --> 19:52.344
Yeah, new buffer, new gas rings.
Cleaned the gas tube.

19:52.552 --> 19:54.512
Surprised you didn't starch the sling.

19:55.014 --> 19:58.559
If you want me to show you how to
shoot it, I'm here all week, 9 to 5.

20:01.063 --> 20:02.439
Shooters, on the line!

20:02.606 --> 20:05.485
Stand by! Ready!

20:28.137 --> 20:30.556
Put them on safe and holster.

20:38.733 --> 20:40.151
No roll, Hondo?

20:40.318 --> 20:41.737
How do you know I didn't?

20:41.904 --> 20:43.823
You didn't, did you?

20:43.990 --> 20:46.117
They only roll in John Woo movies,
not real life.

20:46.285 --> 20:47.911
All right.

20:49.329 --> 20:51.332
Here's the winner.

20:52.166 --> 20:55.336
There's a few people
that I would like to thank.

20:55.503 --> 20:58.590
My fellow SWAT officers, all of you,
thank you for believing in me...

20:58.757 --> 21:00.593
...when the bosses didn't give me
a chance.

21:00.802 --> 21:04.180
That's why you're the marksman and
I'm the guy who tells you who to shoot.

21:04.347 --> 21:07.935
Here you go. I got you covered
since I let you down.

21:12.357 --> 21:13.942
Tell you what...

21:14.151 --> 21:19.032
...I got 100 here says that guy
can kick your ass.

21:19.199 --> 21:22.161
Are you kidding me, Hondo?
Come on. He's our gun bunny.

21:22.328 --> 21:24.456
Oh, well, let's make it 200 then.

21:24.664 --> 21:28.544
Sure. A couple more lap dances
for me tonight.

21:28.836 --> 21:30.630
- Want a piece of this?
- Yeah.

21:30.838 --> 21:32.798
Don't look so worried.

21:40.350 --> 21:41.976
Yo.

21:42.728 --> 21:44.813
Wanna make some extra money?

21:47.859 --> 21:50.362
Hey, don't forget to take
your safety off.

21:50.528 --> 21:53.240
- Street.
- You better get your game face on.

21:54.533 --> 21:57.245
Don't beat him so badly I can't get
a rematch, all right?

21:57.412 --> 21:59.581
I won't make any promises.

21:59.748 --> 22:01.375
It's my money, man.

22:01.542 --> 22:02.293
Shooters, on the line!

22:02.293 --> 22:03.127
Shooters, on the line!

22:03.294 --> 22:06.005
Stand by! Ready!

22:26.990 --> 22:29.325
Put them on safe! Holster!

22:38.586 --> 22:40.506
Here's your winner.

22:43.592 --> 22:44.928
I won, baby.

22:45.095 --> 22:47.014
Thoroughbred!

23:07.038 --> 23:09.624
Yeah, yeah. Passport, please.

23:13.463 --> 23:15.340
Next.

23:33.487 --> 23:36.324
- Next.
- You have anything to declare?

23:36.491 --> 23:38.660
I don't know how you got this
through De Gaulle.

23:38.826 --> 23:42.081
You can't bring this
through the airport.

23:47.754 --> 23:49.005
For luck. Luck.

23:49.339 --> 23:52.093
Gift from my father. Not dangerous.

23:52.259 --> 23:53.928
- Mail it home.
- Okay.

23:54.095 --> 23:55.722
Mail it home.

23:55.889 --> 23:58.100
- Okay?
- Okay. Okay. "Merci."

24:26.801 --> 24:28.220
- Hey, Gus!
- Yeah.

24:28.387 --> 24:30.973
Isn't that eternal damnation
you're chowing down there?

24:31.306 --> 24:32.851
You can't tell Michelle.

24:33.059 --> 24:36.187
Isn't she gonna smell the fries
on your breath?

24:36.856 --> 24:40.526
That's why God invented mouthwash.
She'll never know.

24:40.693 --> 24:43.864
Gus, you're cheating on your wife
with fast food.

24:44.031 --> 24:45.992
You're right. You're absolutely right.

24:46.200 --> 24:49.037
Street, you have a driver's license?

24:49.203 --> 24:51.415
- Got a library card.
- That's good enough.

24:51.582 --> 24:54.043
So get your uniform on.
You're driving me today.

24:54.209 --> 24:55.545
Come on.

24:57.380 --> 24:59.424
Did you get my return ticket
and papers?

24:59.591 --> 25:01.594
Flight leaves tonight at midnight.

25:01.761 --> 25:04.890
- No one knows I'm here?
- Just me.

25:05.057 --> 25:06.975
Where do you wanna go?

25:07.476 --> 25:09.771
It's my uncle's birthday.

25:10.438 --> 25:12.565
I want to surprise him.

25:23.746 --> 25:26.415
If you want me to come by
and mow your lawn later...

25:26.624 --> 25:30.003
...I'm available, sergeant.
- I'll keep that in mind.

25:30.170 --> 25:32.005
Call me Hondo.

25:32.172 --> 25:35.134
I was a Marine. Did two years
in Nam, recon unit.

25:35.301 --> 25:38.847
Spent the next four teaching
combat survival. You serve?

25:39.014 --> 25:42.352
- Yeah.
- Navy SEALs, right?

25:42.519 --> 25:45.980
- That's what my file says.
- So, what did you do for them?

25:46.147 --> 25:49.276
Besides rescue Marines
when they got lost?

25:49.443 --> 25:52.239
You sniper detail,
amphibious assault, what?

25:52.406 --> 25:56.369
My boat-crew leader always said
if anyone knew what we did...

25:56.536 --> 25:58.705
...we'd failed.

25:58.871 --> 26:00.748
That's fair enough.

26:00.915 --> 26:02.668
So where are we going, Hondo?

26:04.169 --> 26:06.798
What say we go see what
the weather's like in South Central?

26:09.384 --> 26:10.970
Tell us where your boyfriend is.

26:13.222 --> 26:17.060
Look, I don't speak Spanish!
Tell me where your boyfriend is!

26:17.227 --> 26:20.231
You're not helping him any!
You're not...

26:21.733 --> 26:23.568
Somebody here gonna get locked up!

26:23.735 --> 26:25.738
R-61-15 in foot pursuit.

26:25.904 --> 26:28.198
Suspect headed south,
west of Defiance.

26:28.365 --> 26:31.411
One black male in Lakers purple.

26:37.460 --> 26:39.421
in Lakers purple.

26:39.588 --> 26:42.174
That's our guy talking.
Where's he at?

26:43.091 --> 26:45.136
What the hell you doing, Navy SEAL?

26:55.106 --> 26:58.110
- Oh, hell yeah! Get on, baby, get on!
- Come on!

28:10.156 --> 28:13.618
Damn! That looked like some Oakland
Raider Jack Tatum action there.

28:13.827 --> 28:15.287
What you know about Jack Tatum?

28:15.454 --> 28:18.458
Turn your ass over!
Put your hands behind your back!

28:18.666 --> 28:20.877
- Name's Hondo.
- I don't give a damn.

28:21.044 --> 28:22.337
I could've caught him myself.

28:22.504 --> 28:25.924
If you like hard work, long hours
and getting dirty for low pay...

28:26.091 --> 28:27.761
...I got an opening
on my SWAT team.

28:27.927 --> 28:29.763
Shut up!

28:30.346 --> 28:31.974
I don't mind that at all.

28:32.183 --> 28:34.769
Pack your bags.
You're coming to SWAT school.

28:34.935 --> 28:36.897
- SWAT school?
- Shut up!

28:37.064 --> 28:38.857
Don't talk too much! Shut up!

28:39.024 --> 28:42.445
Don't y'all got nothing better to do
than be hauling a black man to jail?

28:42.612 --> 28:44.489
Just perpetuating the cycle,
ain't you?

28:44.655 --> 28:47.826
We'll see how liberal you are
when he's breaking into your place.

28:47.993 --> 28:49.870
"Uh-huh," my ass.

28:54.542 --> 28:56.295
Sure you don't want to sit
in the back?

28:56.462 --> 28:58.506
I could wear a little cap.

28:58.714 --> 29:00.509
I like the view from up here.

29:00.717 --> 29:02.803
The cap thing's a nice touch, though.

29:05.098 --> 29:09.061
Officer Burress, Southwest Division.

29:16.319 --> 29:19.865
Well, your test scores are off the chart,
and you got all the right references.

29:20.032 --> 29:20.991
Thank you, sergeant.

29:21.200 --> 29:24.162
Can I get a hot dog with everything
and a ginger ale, please?

29:24.371 --> 29:26.039
Hot dog with everything,
ginger ale.

29:26.248 --> 29:27.541
- Street?
- Same.

29:27.750 --> 29:29.377
Well, I will have a soy dog,
please...

29:29.585 --> 29:31.337
...on a whole-wheat bun, plain...

29:31.504 --> 29:34.716
...and a tomato juice, if you got it.

29:34.883 --> 29:36.343
Thank you.

29:36.552 --> 29:38.179
I'm a vegetarian.

29:38.721 --> 29:40.682
I'm a bit curious.

29:40.849 --> 29:44.145
You've been a cop six years and
you've never had a civilian complaint?

29:44.311 --> 29:47.566
I try to be courteous and professional
with everyone I encounter.

29:47.941 --> 29:50.527
Well, the thing is, Dave...

29:51.612 --> 29:55.158
- David.
- Right. David.

29:55.324 --> 29:56.702
Here's the thing.

29:56.869 --> 30:00.038
There may come a time in SWAT
when you gotta get a little dirty...

30:00.205 --> 30:02.417
...behind a street bust.
You know what I'm saying?

30:03.126 --> 30:04.753
No.

30:08.716 --> 30:10.177
How the hell can I trust a man...

30:10.343 --> 30:13.513
...won't eat a good old-fashioned
American hot dog?

30:13.847 --> 30:15.308
He's a vegetarian.

30:17.935 --> 30:18.060
I'm looking for an injured officer,
name of Sanchez.

30:18.060 --> 30:20.773
I'm looking for an injured officer,
name of Sanchez.

30:20.939 --> 30:22.733
Chris Sanchez.

30:23.067 --> 30:26.196
- Room five. In the corner.
- Thank you.

30:26.571 --> 30:29.992
- What do you need, sarge?
- You Sanchez's partner?

30:31.160 --> 30:32.620
Sanchez do that?

30:34.998 --> 30:37.167
- You help?
- No, sarge.

30:38.169 --> 30:40.088
Reminds me of my third divorce.

30:41.297 --> 30:43.842
- Bad day, huh?
- Kiss my ass, "ése".

30:45.469 --> 30:47.472
I'm starting to like
this Sanchez already.

30:47.680 --> 30:50.975
Spent four years in Metro,
passed the SWAT quals three times.

30:51.184 --> 30:53.062
Been rejected by Fuller three times.

30:53.229 --> 30:56.690
Might be a reason.
He's got a couple of beefs here.

30:56.858 --> 31:00.028
I'm going to get the nurse
to clean and dress your wound.

31:00.195 --> 31:03.074
Sorry. Wrong room.

31:03.241 --> 31:06.328
- Who you looking for?
- Chris Sanchez.

31:07.371 --> 31:08.872
I'm Chris Sanchez.

31:09.039 --> 31:10.833
You're Chris Sanchez?

31:11.418 --> 31:13.461
Look, if you're Internal Affairs...

31:13.628 --> 31:15.881
...that guy had razorblades
in his mouth.

31:16.215 --> 31:17.925
I had to put him down hard.

31:18.092 --> 31:21.138
I'm sick and tired of these bullshit
complaints because some "vato..."

31:21.304 --> 31:24.015
...doesn't like getting thrown
to the pavement by a woman.

31:24.391 --> 31:26.394
I look like IAD to you?

31:28.563 --> 31:29.731
Who are you?

31:29.898 --> 31:32.693
Wait, now, that guy had about
100 pounds on you.

31:32.860 --> 31:35.822
All brawn, no brains.
You didn't answer my question.

31:39.368 --> 31:41.579
So you still want to work SWAT?

31:45.041 --> 31:48.253
No, I just enjoy applying all the time.

31:48.420 --> 31:51.424
Gas it up. Return it.

31:53.552 --> 31:55.804
Am I looking at another day
of chauffeur duty?

31:55.971 --> 31:59.726
- Team's almost filled.
- Not that it hasn't been fun.

31:59.893 --> 32:01.519
Well, I do have one more spot.

32:02.395 --> 32:04.774
Can you think of anybody
I might've overlooked?

32:04.940 --> 32:07.360
This a game or a test, sergeant?

32:08.945 --> 32:12.617
- Could be a bit of both.
- Yeah, I'm a little old for games.

32:12.950 --> 32:14.494
All right.

32:15.036 --> 32:16.789
So how'd you like to be
back on SWAT?

32:19.958 --> 32:20.959
It's not gonna happen.

32:21.126 --> 32:23.713
So why you hanging
around the cage then?

32:23.880 --> 32:25.090
It's a job.

32:25.423 --> 32:27.676
And SWAT's a calling.

32:28.135 --> 32:31.890
Anybody around you for five minutes
can tell you still got the bug.

32:32.057 --> 32:34.351
All you gotta do is say yes.

32:36.395 --> 32:38.564
It's not up to me or you.

32:38.981 --> 32:40.609
I got a history here.

32:40.901 --> 32:43.946
Yeah, let's talk about that.

32:44.989 --> 32:47.992
I heard some rumors
about you and your old partner.

32:48.618 --> 32:51.497
Did you give him up
in Fuller's office?

32:51.664 --> 32:54.166
Because, you know, team members
gotta trust each other.

32:57.087 --> 32:58.797
I'm not on your team.

33:02.009 --> 33:05.597
And no, I didn't give him up.

33:06.807 --> 33:10.103
You've been in that cage six months,
shining boots and fixing weapons...

33:10.270 --> 33:11.980
...waiting for a second chance.

33:12.188 --> 33:15.693
I got one, and I'm offering it to you.

33:18.280 --> 33:20.157
Fuller will never sign off on it.

33:20.323 --> 33:23.327
You let me deal
with that paper-pushing punk.

33:23.536 --> 33:25.496
I want you on my team.

33:30.961 --> 33:32.881
Let me tell you, it's the sauce.

33:33.047 --> 33:35.758
If you don't have the right sauce,
what do you got? You know?

33:35.925 --> 33:37.595
My mother, she used to make sauce.

33:37.761 --> 33:42.642
Now you go into the store,
and you buy it in a jar or in a can...

33:43.602 --> 33:44.603
Alex?

33:44.769 --> 33:46.981
Alex! Nobody told me
you were coming.

33:47.148 --> 33:50.485
- When did you get here?
- Surprise.

33:50.944 --> 33:52.362
Happy birthday, Uncle.

33:52.654 --> 33:56.034
Come on, sit down. Sit.
Bring some champagne, huh?

33:56.576 --> 33:58.203
Sit, eat.

33:58.411 --> 34:00.247
The chief's making me take you back.

34:00.414 --> 34:02.750
He's concerned about losing
all his best officers.

34:02.917 --> 34:05.420
- He thinks I'm one of his best officers?
- But...

34:05.587 --> 34:07.255
...he's given me complete oversight.

34:07.422 --> 34:09.926
And trust me,
you got no room for error.

34:10.885 --> 34:17.266
So I will give you Boxer, T.J. McCabe
and this new guy...

34:18.185 --> 34:20.605
...Deacon Kaye.

34:20.772 --> 34:24.235
I have to pass on the other two.
Sanchez is a woman, and Street...

34:24.400 --> 34:26.070
Well, Street's on my shitlist.

34:26.237 --> 34:28.949
Hey, I'm on your shitlist too,
and I'm the team leader.

34:29.116 --> 34:31.909
You work for me now,
and it's my team to choose.

34:32.077 --> 34:36.248
With all due respect, captain,
other leaders get to pick their teams.

34:36.456 --> 34:39.795
And you can too.
Just pick two new people.

34:39.962 --> 34:41.547
Look...

34:42.507 --> 34:44.759
...just give me the team I ask for.

34:44.926 --> 34:47.138
You can even call it
your shitlist team.

34:47.388 --> 34:50.766
That way, if anything goes wrong,
you can put all the blame on me.

34:51.350 --> 34:53.812
It'd be just like old times.

34:57.984 --> 34:59.610
Okay.

34:59.777 --> 35:02.406
Okay, you got your team.

35:02.990 --> 35:07.036
But when you fail,
and you probably will fail...

35:07.203 --> 35:11.292
...Sanchez goes back to Traffic,
and you and Street are plain gone.

35:11.792 --> 35:15.464
No, not just off SWAT, off the force.

35:15.672 --> 35:19.301
- You feel me?
- Oh, yeah.

35:19.509 --> 35:21.262
I feel you.

35:24.515 --> 35:27.603
- Okay, I'm leaving now.
- No, don't go.

35:27.853 --> 35:30.607
I have wine and cognac from home.
Come on.

35:30.773 --> 35:34.320
- I must go. I have a flight to catch.
- Oh, catch another flight.

35:34.487 --> 35:36.947
Let me introduce you to Monica.

35:42.662 --> 35:44.582
You like this knife?

35:45.875 --> 35:49.046
This is my father's knife.
He gave it to me.

35:51.632 --> 35:54.511
It's a beautiful knife,
and she's a beautiful woman.

35:54.719 --> 35:58.015
Now, why don't you stay, have a
good time and go back tomorrow.

35:58.182 --> 36:01.519
Listen, I'm running the business now.

36:01.685 --> 36:03.647
I'm the new boss.

36:05.899 --> 36:07.693
Don't joke with me, Alex.

36:07.860 --> 36:11.155
And don't ever forget,
your father's running the business.

36:12.449 --> 36:14.743
No, I retired him.

36:15.118 --> 36:17.747
He never spoke of that to me.

36:18.581 --> 36:21.252
That's because
he can't speak anymore.

36:30.262 --> 36:32.557
You put your hand
in my father's pocket.

36:34.892 --> 36:36.687
Not in mine.

36:39.273 --> 36:44.070
If you take my money,
I'll take your life. Understood?

36:54.876 --> 36:56.836
Mail it to me.

37:18.404 --> 37:20.281
- Yeah!
- Smile!

37:50.025 --> 37:50.985
Good evening.

37:51.402 --> 37:54.197
May I see your license,
registration and proof of insurance?

37:54.364 --> 37:57.243
I'm a tourist, you know.
I'm visiting the U.S.

37:57.618 --> 37:59.537
I have my passport if you want.

37:59.704 --> 38:01.373
Let me see it.

38:02.916 --> 38:04.585
Whose car is this?

38:04.752 --> 38:07.463
It belongs to my uncle. Why?

38:08.381 --> 38:10.342
You got a left taillight out.

38:15.223 --> 38:16.766
Hi, this is Bridget the Midget.

38:16.933 --> 38:21.063
We're out here in front of the Key Club
on Sunset in beautiful Hollywood.

38:21.230 --> 38:23.358
I just wonder how you can
get inside of there.

38:23.567 --> 38:26.570
Anyways, we're on Sunset Boulevard,
where anything could happen.

38:26.736 --> 38:28.197
Especially police harassment.

38:28.364 --> 38:31.659
Hey, you guys, you're all pigs!

38:34.413 --> 38:36.164
Is your uncle's name
Martin Gascoigne?

38:36.331 --> 38:39.335
- Yeah. So we're okay?
- There's a warrant in that name...

38:39.502 --> 38:42.673
...and I have to detain you
until we can verify who you are.

38:42.840 --> 38:45.259
Sir, please step out of the vehicle.

39:04.908 --> 39:08.078
- You're here awful early.
- Traffic was lighter than usual.

39:08.245 --> 39:10.207
Streets must've been
damn near empty.

39:16.297 --> 39:17.798
Ali's his sister.

39:17.965 --> 39:19.885
And I called bottoms on the last one.

39:20.052 --> 39:22.221
You called bottoms,
but that's not what you got.

39:22.387 --> 39:24.097
- Yo, dog, what's up?
- What's happening?

39:25.433 --> 39:27.268
- Jim.
- Boxer.

39:30.564 --> 39:33.818
So, what did you do to my sister?

39:34.152 --> 39:35.403
Nothing.

39:35.570 --> 39:36.947
That's not what I heard.

39:37.155 --> 39:39.325
I mean, that's not the word
on the street.

39:39.700 --> 39:42.913
She's all broken up over you.

39:43.747 --> 39:47.417
- Don't know why. She left me.
- Dumped.

39:47.584 --> 39:49.337
A case of crabs
will do that to a woman.

39:49.504 --> 39:51.798
Is there something about this team
I need to know?

39:52.006 --> 39:53.968
I want to know
what an asshole like you...

39:54.176 --> 39:56.470
...did to my little sister
to make her leave.

39:57.430 --> 40:00.267
She's 28, all right?

40:00.433 --> 40:03.062
And trust me, she's not so little.

40:03.229 --> 40:04.605
- Trust you?
- No, you didn't.

40:04.772 --> 40:08.277
How's your last partner doing?
Gamble. He trust you too?

40:09.528 --> 40:11.698
- You wanna talk about this?
- You gonna tell me?

40:11.865 --> 40:13.491
Been on your chest
for a while, yeah?

40:13.700 --> 40:15.034
Street!

40:16.453 --> 40:18.205
You wanna talk about it?

40:19.415 --> 40:20.834
Come here.

40:21.042 --> 40:22.836
- Don't talk about what you don't...
- Yo!

40:24.045 --> 40:25.965
Street! It's not worth it.

40:26.382 --> 40:27.633
Who else you gonna narc on?

40:27.884 --> 40:29.802
Who are you?

40:30.387 --> 40:32.681
Who the hell are you?

40:36.394 --> 40:39.857
Guess you're not the prettiest
one here anymore, huh, T.J.?

40:40.024 --> 40:43.194
Well, sounds like you've all
gotten acquainted.

40:43.652 --> 40:45.530
Let's get started.

40:45.864 --> 40:47.532
I'll make this simple.

40:47.699 --> 40:50.536
L.A.P.D. SWAT is the most honored,
most respected...

40:50.745 --> 40:53.874
...and most professional
police division in the world.

41:04.595 --> 41:08.266
Go, go, go!

41:24.619 --> 41:27.456
- Police!
- Police! Police!

41:33.213 --> 41:34.714
That ain't gonna get it.

41:41.890 --> 41:43.141
Bang.

41:43.308 --> 41:45.018
Sanchez.

42:01.330 --> 42:02.415
Money.

42:16.974 --> 42:19.436
Oh, man.

42:19.644 --> 42:21.479
That sucked.

42:21.646 --> 42:23.858
- What's up, Sanchez?
- You all right there?

42:24.942 --> 42:27.738
When you're done with that one,
I got one for you.

42:33.036 --> 42:36.331
T.J.'s sitting on two pair.
Looking for the boat.

42:38.500 --> 42:39.960
Got it.

42:40.169 --> 42:42.297
Street, you got three aces.

42:42.464 --> 42:44.341
Need one to take T.J. Out.

42:45.967 --> 42:47.845
Got a winner, winner!

42:48.679 --> 42:50.974
All right, Deke.
Let's see what you got.

42:53.018 --> 42:56.981
Ten of spades. Spade flush.
Not good enough.

42:57.148 --> 43:00.068
Hondo, isn't that a straight flush?

43:00.861 --> 43:02.154
Hold the phone.

43:02.613 --> 43:04.365
Six, seven...

43:04.531 --> 43:08.453
...eight, nine, ten of spades!
Straight flush.

43:08.620 --> 43:09.872
Deke!

43:10.081 --> 43:12.041
Beats four aces in Compton any day.

43:12.250 --> 43:14.001
I think it works in Orange County too.

43:14.168 --> 43:16.672
Sure you're right.
Good work, guys.

43:26.100 --> 43:27.935
Police! Police!

43:32.607 --> 43:33.693
Clear.

43:33.859 --> 43:36.737
- Clear.
- Clear. Go.

43:43.830 --> 43:44.956
That's right.

43:45.123 --> 43:49.920
SWAT is a life-saving organization,
not a life-taking one.

43:50.087 --> 43:55.093
come here to train with us.

43:56.511 --> 43:58.306
Smooth, Deke.

44:00.266 --> 44:02.853
I guess if I was deaf,
I wouldn't know you were here.

44:03.020 --> 44:06.774
But while you're laughing, there's
lots of people that want us to fail.

44:06.983 --> 44:08.735
Get it right.

44:18.997 --> 44:20.291
- Clear.
- Clear.

44:20.458 --> 44:21.918
Clear.

44:26.924 --> 44:29.594
Suspect, put your hands
on your head and come out.

44:29.761 --> 44:31.262
- Come out!
- Come out now!

44:31.429 --> 44:33.014
- Turn around.
- Go!

44:33.181 --> 44:35.434
- Down.
- Get down.

44:35.601 --> 44:37.144
Yeah.

44:37.353 --> 44:38.980
Outstanding, guys.

44:41.524 --> 44:43.109
You feel that?

44:50.202 --> 44:53.414
The team's going out for beers later.
I'm buying.

44:53.581 --> 44:55.792
I'll take mine after we pass.

44:56.334 --> 44:59.296
Well, Fuller's definitely
gonna try and hose us.

44:59.630 --> 45:03.385
Good. I'd hate to break a sweat
just for a first-round knockout.

45:04.636 --> 45:07.348
Hey, we got a big day tomorrow.
Save some.

45:07.515 --> 45:08.849
I got plenty.

45:10.226 --> 45:12.729
I'm depending on you
to get these guys through this.

45:14.523 --> 45:16.609
I'll cover my end.

45:17.944 --> 45:20.738
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah, go for it.

45:21.865 --> 45:23.200
Why'd you pick me?

45:26.538 --> 45:28.331
To piss off the captain.

45:54.864 --> 45:56.574
All right, here's the scenario.

45:56.782 --> 45:59.620
There are six hijackers
armed with handguns and knives...

45:59.786 --> 46:01.580
...in control of that plane.

46:01.788 --> 46:04.792
They've killed one hostage
and are threatening to kill the others...

46:04.959 --> 46:07.253
...unless they get a pilot and fuel
within the hour.

46:07.462 --> 46:09.757
There'll be SWAT officers
disguised as hostages.

46:09.923 --> 46:12.635
Other SWAT officers
will be playing the roles of terrorists.

46:12.802 --> 46:15.347
And they will be trying to kill you.

46:15.513 --> 46:17.475
Staff sergeants will be grading us.

46:17.642 --> 46:20.770
Couldn't give us the bus, huh, Hondo?
They always give us the bus.

46:20.978 --> 46:23.398
- Fuller's really got it in for us.
- You think?

46:23.815 --> 46:26.610
Another thing.
There are two dynamic entry points.

46:26.818 --> 46:29.280
One here beneath
the front landing gear...

46:29.447 --> 46:31.992
...one back here
by the baggage compartment.

46:32.159 --> 46:35.454
I'm sure Fuller's got surprises
at both those entrances.

46:35.746 --> 46:38.625
We get bogged down anywhere,
we fail.

46:38.917 --> 46:40.627
Any ideas?

46:40.835 --> 46:42.964
There's another way in, Hondo.

46:44.048 --> 46:46.927
There's an elevator shaft
where they bring in the service carts.

46:47.219 --> 46:50.263
And there's a mechanic's access
right here.

46:50.473 --> 46:52.475
- Man, that's gonna be tight as hell.
- Yeah.

46:52.684 --> 46:54.477
How many men can we fit in there?

46:54.644 --> 46:57.356
Men? None.

47:02.279 --> 47:04.030
All right.

47:04.197 --> 47:07.159
Work this out.
Get in there and break Fuller's heart.

47:09.538 --> 47:11.373
- Okay.
- What do we got?

47:11.540 --> 47:13.835
- Toy guns.
- Toy guns, sir. Toy guns.

47:14.002 --> 47:15.295
- Let's do this.
- All right.

47:15.461 --> 47:17.338
Shame you're not playing a terrorist.

47:29.729 --> 47:31.314
I'm supposed to be in first class.

47:31.522 --> 47:33.692
We got camera three going up.

47:34.985 --> 47:38.698
Three is set.
Checked it out on the monitor.

47:38.906 --> 47:41.784
- "Are you ready?"
- Oh, yeah.

47:42.745 --> 47:45.039
Okay, let's see what they got.

49:27.747 --> 49:31.168
- How'd you know about this place?
- I've known a few stewardesses.

49:31.710 --> 49:33.170
Just a few?

50:12.050 --> 50:15.012
- Stand by. We got a device.
- Same here.

50:46.759 --> 50:47.760
Disarmed.

50:50.431 --> 50:51.473
Set.

51:02.987 --> 51:04.281
Here we go.

51:04.906 --> 51:06.116
Three.

51:06.783 --> 51:07.826
Two.

51:08.410 --> 51:09.620
One.

51:13.124 --> 51:14.084
Boxer, one down.

51:25.931 --> 51:26.932
Down!

51:29.353 --> 51:30.312
Damn.

51:34.567 --> 51:36.486
- "Deke?"
- I got one down.

51:36.694 --> 51:37.780
- "McCabe?"
- "I got one."

51:38.364 --> 51:39.823
Sanchez, one down.

51:39.990 --> 51:42.786
That's five. There's one more, guys.

51:42.952 --> 51:44.287
There's a sleeper. Come on.

51:50.211 --> 51:51.171
Come on.

51:59.055 --> 52:00.181
That'll be six.

52:00.391 --> 52:02.017
- "Clear."
- Clear.

52:02.226 --> 52:03.519
- Clear.
- Clear.

52:03.727 --> 52:08.024
10-David, this is 70-David.
We are Code Four. All clear.

52:08.233 --> 52:10.236
Oh, yeah.

52:10.403 --> 52:13.531
Wow. Is that a new course record?

52:20.707 --> 52:23.000
- Yeah.
- All right.

52:23.334 --> 52:25.838
Good job, guys.

52:27.172 --> 52:28.424
Damn.

52:38.770 --> 52:40.564
Please, Pop, please.

52:40.772 --> 52:43.067
- Yo, Sanchez.
- I'm in SWAT now.

52:43.276 --> 52:46.904
Yo, Deke. Deke, is that you, man?

52:47.113 --> 52:48.157
Oh, my God, Deke.

52:48.323 --> 52:50.451
- Tell me that ain't you.
- You were a butterball.

52:50.659 --> 52:52.829
That's all in the past.

52:52.996 --> 52:55.248
I ate here every day,
worked here every summer.

52:55.415 --> 52:57.334
I ended up looking like Fat Albert.

52:57.501 --> 53:00.463
I'm cool. Eating right
has me looking like this.

53:02.049 --> 53:03.550
Man, put that away.

53:03.759 --> 53:06.137
Hey, put that away.

53:06.304 --> 53:07.972
Put another in for me.

53:08.139 --> 53:09.766
Hey, yeah, break out your money.

53:09.974 --> 53:13.145
- Work it, baby.
- I'll give you back change. Watch it.

53:13.312 --> 53:16.775
Hey! So you're celebrating
without me, huh?

53:16.941 --> 53:19.277
- Mr. Kaye, you're the master.
- Like son, like father.

53:19.611 --> 53:23.115
- That was one kick-ass display today.
- That's what I'm talking about.

53:23.324 --> 53:25.619
All right, but let's remember one thing.

53:25.786 --> 53:28.163
If that was a real operation
and not a test...

53:28.330 --> 53:30.333
...one of us would be calling
T.J.'s family...

53:30.500 --> 53:32.919
...trying to explain
what went wrong today.

53:35.047 --> 53:38.133
One casualty may be acceptable
by department standards...

53:38.675 --> 53:42.055
...never acceptable by mine.
We clear on that?

53:42.222 --> 53:43.348
Got you.

53:43.515 --> 53:45.309
- Crystal.
- Yes, sir.

53:45.559 --> 53:48.062
All right. Well, let's continue
celebrating tonight...

53:48.229 --> 53:50.273
...but tomorrow, we're SWAT.

53:50.440 --> 53:52.609
Nice.

53:58.867 --> 54:00.452
I love you too.

54:00.619 --> 54:03.081
Homeland Security, my ass.
They can't keep me like this.

54:03.540 --> 54:07.294
I've been patient, day after day.

54:07.628 --> 54:09.422
So tell me, what's going on?

54:09.630 --> 54:13.218
This is the problem.
Your prints do not match your ID.

54:13.385 --> 54:16.179
So they're running another check
through the FBI and Interpol.

54:16.346 --> 54:18.266
Interpol, shit. Get me out of here.

54:18.433 --> 54:20.601
- I'm doing everything I can.
- Do more.

54:20.768 --> 54:22.855
This is easy.
Who do we have to pay?

54:23.063 --> 54:25.357
You can't solve this problem
by throwing money at it.

54:25.649 --> 54:27.861
Then who do we have to kill?

54:28.570 --> 54:31.574
Come on, guys, it's only 11:00.

54:31.741 --> 54:34.869
I got a babysitter for the first time
in three months.

54:35.077 --> 54:37.706
- We've been up since 4:00.
- That's weak.

54:37.873 --> 54:40.501
If I get home by midnight,
I might get me some.

54:40.668 --> 54:41.669
T.J.?

54:41.836 --> 54:45.340
I get home before midnight,
I'm finding some. Sorry, babe.

54:46.008 --> 54:47.718
- Boxer?
- I know I'm not getting some.

54:47.885 --> 54:50.555
If I don't get home soon,
my wife's gonna freak.

54:51.765 --> 54:53.850
You guys suck.

54:54.685 --> 54:57.688
You know how hard it is
to find a babysitter?

55:03.738 --> 55:05.782
Yo, Street.

55:05.948 --> 55:07.742
Did you pass?

55:08.034 --> 55:10.079
- Yeah.
- Awesome.

55:10.287 --> 55:13.291
- First round's on the house.
- Thanks, darling.

55:13.666 --> 55:15.710
Anything but tequila, please.

55:15.877 --> 55:17.880
- No?
- No.

55:21.550 --> 55:25.305
- We did good today, huh?
- Yeah.

55:26.556 --> 55:28.434
What's it like...

55:29.060 --> 55:30.228
...the real thing?

55:31.646 --> 55:35.609
It's faster. It's a lot faster.

55:42.284 --> 55:43.828
You know that guy?

55:44.703 --> 55:46.415
Used to.

55:48.792 --> 55:50.252
Bye.

55:51.671 --> 55:53.172
See you.

55:54.173 --> 55:56.343
It's all yours, man.

56:04.310 --> 56:06.689
- How you doing?
- Oh, man, I am good.

56:07.398 --> 56:10.360
- Heard they took you back.
- Yeah.

56:11.403 --> 56:13.029
This your girlfriend?

56:13.196 --> 56:15.783
No. No, she's SWAT.

56:16.117 --> 56:18.662
- She wha...?
- She's...

56:23.501 --> 56:26.880
This is what it's come down to,
busting down doors with J. Lo?

56:29.258 --> 56:31.802
You know, I didn't know
that they made bulletproof bras.

56:31.969 --> 56:34.431
Is it just me?
You know, I didn't know that.

56:34.598 --> 56:36.725
What they need to make
are bulletproof condoms...

56:36.892 --> 56:38.853
...big enough to fit your big head.

56:41.606 --> 56:43.358
Nice. Good, I like it.

56:44.485 --> 56:46.361
This your girlfriend? Cute.

56:46.528 --> 56:48.323
No, but you can be my bitch.

56:49.991 --> 56:50.992
Really?

56:56.917 --> 56:59.252
No, man, leave it alone.

56:59.419 --> 57:00.754
- Here we go.
- Leave it alone.

57:00.922 --> 57:04.884
- Hey. How are you?
- I'm good.

57:05.384 --> 57:07.262
Put it on my tab?

57:10.642 --> 57:13.895
Hey, glad to see all that butt-kissing's
really paid off.

57:14.646 --> 57:16.774
Say Hi to Fuller for me.

57:20.195 --> 57:21.696
What?

57:29.790 --> 57:32.418
You should've let me kick his ass.

57:33.110 --> 57:35.404
I just saved yours.

57:36.323 --> 57:39.952
So you and this guy Gamble
were partners, huh?

57:40.327 --> 57:42.956
So how long you got
the babysitter for?

57:44.666 --> 57:47.628
Just because I bought you a drink
doesn't mean...

57:47.795 --> 57:49.923
...you get laid tonight.

57:50.840 --> 57:53.009
So, what does two drinks mean?

57:55.054 --> 57:57.390
Do you want to come over
to my house?

57:58.057 --> 57:59.977
That was easy.

58:00.143 --> 58:02.813
It's my kid's birthday party tomorrow.

58:02.980 --> 58:04.607
Tomorrow?

58:05.984 --> 58:08.737
Kids, birthday parties...

58:09.280 --> 58:12.032
I'm hosting a Tupperware party
tomorrow.

58:12.867 --> 58:16.246
- You, Tupperware?
- Yeah, seals in the freshness.

58:16.413 --> 58:19.000
Party's completely booked,
otherwise I'd invite you.

58:19.166 --> 58:22.211
Tomorrow, noon.

58:27.886 --> 58:30.597
Central, open South Sally port.

58:36.186 --> 58:38.315
All right, gentlemen, take a seat.

59:07.975 --> 59:11.438
You may have won the battle,
but you lost the war!

59:12.689 --> 59:15.235
- Dad, can I have some of this?
- Yeah, go ahead, get it.

59:15.443 --> 59:18.196
- Can I have this too?
- Whatever you want. Get it, get it.

59:26.539 --> 59:30.461
Look at that. A cop
who drinks French champagne.

59:30.878 --> 59:33.882
That is just impressive.

59:34.800 --> 59:39.556
I may work in the mud, but I certainly
like to play up in the clouds.

59:41.474 --> 59:43.894
I thought you said you'd fix the sink.

59:45.604 --> 59:48.900
<i>This is Lt. Harrelson,
O lympic SWAT commander.</i>

59:54.907 --> 59:58.453
<i>This is top priority. Patch me through
to all black and whites in the area.</i>

01:00:02.041 --> 01:00:03.835
- I gotta go.
- Kids, come on, come on.

01:00:04.002 --> 01:00:05.753
- It's time to ruin Mommy's day.
- Okay.

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:08.382
But you killed in the soccer game!

01:00:14.347 --> 01:00:16.309
Come on, don't just stand there!

01:00:16.475 --> 01:00:19.520
Baby, I have to go play
cops and robbers.

01:00:19.687 --> 01:00:21.815
Okay.

01:00:22.024 --> 01:00:23.650
- Okay.
- I love you.

01:00:23.817 --> 01:00:25.361
Me too.

01:00:42.131 --> 01:00:46.303
Hey, guys, the reason
we are gathered on our God-given...

01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:50.767
...much-needed day of rest
is we have a Polish hostage.

01:00:51.184 --> 01:00:53.729
- So what if he's Polish?
- No, no. Means he's one of those:

01:00:53.896 --> 01:00:56.899
"Anybody comes in,
I'll blow my head off" type of guys.

01:00:57.399 --> 01:00:59.694
Negotiations aren't going well.

01:00:59.861 --> 01:01:02.364
- They think he's off his meds.
- We've been lobbing gas.

01:01:02.573 --> 01:01:05.576
This guy's still smoking cigarettes,
popping off shotgun rounds...

01:01:05.743 --> 01:01:07.287
...out the front door.

01:01:09.081 --> 01:01:14.545
I want a limo, a 12-pack
and clove cigarettes!

01:01:14.754 --> 01:01:17.925
I say we go in the back,
hard with shields.

01:01:18.092 --> 01:01:21.095
Negative. Guy says he has all
the doors and windows wired...

01:01:21.263 --> 01:01:23.348
...with high explosives.
- Come on, Greg!

01:01:23.515 --> 01:01:27.728
Look, Dan, you wrote the book.
I just read it. Any suggestions?

01:01:30.439 --> 01:01:31.775
I got an idea.

01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:56.722
Ready?

01:02:01.311 --> 01:02:03.689
It's the damn robot aliens.

01:02:15.036 --> 01:02:19.124
Down! Down! Down! Down!

01:02:19.333 --> 01:02:21.752
- Down!
- Put your hands behind your back.

01:02:23.171 --> 01:02:25.048
- Stay down.
- You know what?

01:02:25.673 --> 01:02:27.426
I think he might be Polish.

01:02:27.968 --> 01:02:29.845
Unbelievable.

01:02:30.137 --> 01:02:33.475
- Like opening a can of sardines.
- It works.

01:03:00.258 --> 01:03:02.593
Drop Fruit of the Loomski
in the A-car.

01:03:04.596 --> 01:03:07.266
Damn, man, you need to be
selling that shit on eBay.

01:03:07.432 --> 01:03:10.603
- No, I only got one.
- Split the profits 50-50.

01:03:10.770 --> 01:03:14.066
Corner the market.
Break them down like a shotgun.

01:03:14.233 --> 01:03:16.652
"The Polish Penetrator."

01:03:16.819 --> 01:03:21.074
Hold on, sports fans. I just got a call
from Sheriff's. It seems we've been...

01:03:21.241 --> 01:03:24.704
...holding a high-priority international
and didn't even know it.

01:03:24.912 --> 01:03:28.125
- They want us as escorts?
- You're my new favorite crew.

01:03:28.292 --> 01:03:30.002
Just get the prisoner
to headquarters.

01:03:35.591 --> 01:03:38.429
This is 9-Tom King
transporting inmates to Superior.

01:03:38.596 --> 01:03:41.348
We've got a black and white
signaling a pullover.

01:03:41.515 --> 01:03:43.768
<i>Roger that. What's your 10-20?</i>

01:03:44.769 --> 01:03:46.856
Hollywood and Wilcox.

01:03:47.023 --> 01:03:49.942
9-Tom King, stand by
while we identify the black and white.

01:03:50.109 --> 01:03:51.360
Roger.

01:03:55.115 --> 01:03:58.119
<i>"9"- "Tom King, there is a problem"
with one of your transports.</i>

01:03:58.286 --> 01:04:00.705
The unit signaling is probably
providing interception.

01:04:00.956 --> 01:04:02.916
Can you read his patrol number?

01:04:03.125 --> 01:04:05.210
Negative.
It's an L.A.P.D. Black and white.

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:08.089
<i>Stand b y while we confirm.</i>

01:04:48.597 --> 01:04:52.059
9-Tom King, this is 70-David.
What's your location?

01:04:52.686 --> 01:04:55.397
"9"- "Tom King, do you copy?"

01:04:57.525 --> 01:04:58.859
What about me, boss?

01:04:59.694 --> 01:05:01.654
Let's go. Get these off.

01:05:01.821 --> 01:05:03.991
"9"- "Tom King, there is a problem."

01:05:04.199 --> 01:05:05.659
9-Tom King, do you copy?

01:05:06.744 --> 01:05:08.621
There it is, on the right.

01:05:08.788 --> 01:05:12.001
- "9"- "Tom King, do you copy?"
- This is 70-David.

01:05:12.209 --> 01:05:15.129
We're Code Six with the bus
at Hollywood and Wilcox.

01:05:16.631 --> 01:05:20.635
<i>114, this is 70-David.
We're Code Four.</i>

01:05:23.723 --> 01:05:28.562
<i>114, this is 70-David. We're
Code Six at Hollywood and Wilco x.</i>

01:05:54.761 --> 01:05:57.680
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

01:06:29.511 --> 01:06:31.389
- Out of the car!
- Get out of the car.

01:06:31.555 --> 01:06:34.016
- On the ground now!
- Get out of the car!

01:06:34.934 --> 01:06:37.270
- Down! Down!
- Let's see your hands!

01:06:37.437 --> 01:06:39.815
Freeze!
Put your hands on your head!

01:06:40.817 --> 01:06:42.276
Hands up!

01:06:46.323 --> 01:06:47.992
Hollywood, huh?

01:06:50.286 --> 01:06:52.664
On the ground! On the ground!

01:07:04.137 --> 01:07:05.805
Do not move!

01:07:06.014 --> 01:07:07.432
Do not move!

01:07:07.598 --> 01:07:10.769
Move again! Move again!

01:07:14.399 --> 01:07:16.609
<i>Drama in Hollywood today.</i>

- Hell, yeah.

Hey, "ése", are you for real
or what, homes?

01:09:25.183 --> 01:09:26.975
Hey, I'm talking to you, "ése"!

01:09:28.853 --> 01:09:31.106
We've been looking
for this punk a long time.

01:09:31.273 --> 01:09:34.486
Busted taillight brings him down?
That's amazing.

01:09:34.694 --> 01:09:37.988
The plan is to have you escort him
to a federal prison out in the desert.

01:09:38.156 --> 01:09:41.118
You may want to have press
photographers meet us at the facility...

01:09:41.285 --> 01:09:44.288
...soon as my boys hand him over.
It's a hell of a story.

01:09:44.622 --> 01:09:47.000
Yeah, we'll pass that request
up the ladder to D.C.

01:09:47.209 --> 01:09:50.462
- Good.
- Gentlemen, at 1300 hours...

01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:53.676
...an L.A.P.D. Helicopter will arrive
to transport the defendant.

01:09:53.884 --> 01:09:57.471
Until we get him inside
a federal facility, he's our baby.

01:09:57.638 --> 01:09:59.766
Sgt. Howard, your team's
got the high ground.

01:09:59.933 --> 01:10:01.810
- Yes, sir.
- Sgt. Hondo.

01:10:01.976 --> 01:10:05.189
Your boys are gonna provide close
proximity protection for the prisoner.

01:10:05.356 --> 01:10:07.024
- Copy that.
- Sgt. Yamoto.

01:10:07.191 --> 01:10:09.653
You're gonna set up a perimeter
around Parker Center.

01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:12.031
- I'm on it.
- Piece of cake.

01:10:20.999 --> 01:10:23.044
Roger, 10-David,
we're coming out.

01:10:26.090 --> 01:10:28.551
Okay, guys, let's get this frog
in the bird.

01:10:30.929 --> 01:10:32.973
What's $ 100 million
six ways, Box?

01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:35.183
Sixteen-something.

01:10:35.350 --> 01:10:38.896
Man, I'd have floor seats at the Lakers,
put my kids through college...

01:10:39.105 --> 01:10:41.650
...hire Halle Berry
as my yoga instructor.

01:10:59.047 --> 01:11:01.049
- Match engine power.
- RPMs match.

01:11:06.555 --> 01:11:08.182
Gear down now.

01:11:26.162 --> 01:11:27.623
Cover!

01:11:28.165 --> 01:11:30.000
We've been hit! We've been hit!

01:11:32.253 --> 01:11:35.715
Shots fired. Shots fired.
Did anybody see where it came from?

01:11:38.844 --> 01:11:44.559
- Hit second engine. Going down.
- Mayday! Mayday! We're going down!

01:11:48.439 --> 01:11:49.857
Down!

01:12:10.883 --> 01:12:12.093
Everybody okay?

01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:15.806
- T.J., Sanchez, take the suspect, go!
- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

01:12:15.973 --> 01:12:18.684
70-David to 114!
We're coming in!

01:12:23.314 --> 01:12:25.025
- Come here.
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

01:12:25.234 --> 01:12:28.363
Jim! Jim! Street! Keep it together,
buddy. Keep it together.

01:12:28.530 --> 01:12:30.574
- Keep it together.
- Shut up!

01:12:30.741 --> 01:12:33.453
Knock it off. We don't have time
for your personal shit.

01:12:33.619 --> 01:12:36.789
- Move him out. Let's move!
- Let's go.

01:12:36.956 --> 01:12:38.459
Move!

01:12:43.923 --> 01:12:45.383
You tell them we're under attack!

01:12:45.550 --> 01:12:48.763
An L.A.P.D. Airship is down. How do
you want us to proceed at this point?

01:12:48.929 --> 01:12:51.640
- What the hell happened?
- Somebody shot our bird down.

01:12:51.808 --> 01:12:53.977
No shit. How?

01:12:54.144 --> 01:12:57.857
My guess is big-bore rifle, .50 caliber.
Somebody who knows how to use it.

01:12:58.024 --> 01:13:01.487
- We're at a whole new level here.
- So where the hell is the shooter?

01:13:02.237 --> 01:13:04.865
I want this asshole out of here now.

01:13:05.032 --> 01:13:08.078
Best bet's to keep him on lockdown till
we see who we're dealing with.

01:13:08.286 --> 01:13:09.621
- Capt. Fuller?
- Yes.

01:13:09.788 --> 01:13:12.416
I've got the chief of police
on the phone for you.

01:13:12.583 --> 01:13:14.085
So now we're talking about my ass.

01:13:14.585 --> 01:13:17.839
You draw up a plan, you execute it,
and do not screw this up.

01:13:18.048 --> 01:13:19.841
Have it transferred to my office.

01:13:27.976 --> 01:13:31.981
Can't believe how much grief that
frog's $ 100 million offer's bringing us.

01:13:35.444 --> 01:13:37.363
You guys ready?
You know what you gotta do?

01:13:37.530 --> 01:13:39.616
- Yes, sir.
- Where's T.J.?

01:13:39.825 --> 01:13:43.621
I'm right here, Hondo. Sorry, man.
Had some bad Thai food last night.

01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:46.624
- It's not sitting well with me.
- So are you good to go or what?

01:13:46.833 --> 01:13:48.460
No, I'm good now.

01:13:49.503 --> 01:13:51.713
Let's go make the captain
look like a hero.

01:13:51.964 --> 01:13:54.968
- Be safe out there.
- Headed to the bird.

01:13:55.135 --> 01:13:56.594
All right, we're moving out.

01:13:57.387 --> 01:13:59.348
Let's load them up!

01:14:11.362 --> 01:14:13.824
Time to go.

01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:17.370
Put that on.

01:14:29.968 --> 01:14:32.346
Marry me! Marry me, Alex!

01:14:36.393 --> 01:14:38.395
Marry me!

01:14:48.407 --> 01:14:50.243
Marry me!

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:09.225
Hey!

01:15:10.434 --> 01:15:11.477
Come on!

01:15:26.871 --> 01:15:30.583
Oh, shit. Hold it. Hey, come on now,
get out of the damn street!

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:32.711
Wait there. Come on now!

01:16:45.049 --> 01:16:46.927
Alex, let's go!

01:16:48.428 --> 01:16:50.931
Get down! Get down now!

01:16:51.098 --> 01:16:53.976
- Get on the ground! Move!
- Keep your hands on your head!

01:16:54.143 --> 01:16:55.394
- Hands up!
- Don't move!

01:16:55.561 --> 01:16:57.564
I got him!

01:17:16.921 --> 01:17:20.384
I don't know, talk to them.
Try to make it work.

01:17:21.093 --> 01:17:24.430
Look, I've had enough problems
for one day, you know?

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:28.184
- Hey, where's Mike?
- Family emergency.

01:17:28.351 --> 01:17:30.855
- Let me know if you need anything.
- All right.

01:17:31.063 --> 01:17:33.900
Just try to get us there alive,
for starters.

01:17:57.220 --> 01:18:00.724
- My sister's dating some new guy.
- Yeah?

01:18:00.891 --> 01:18:03.227
Yeah, I met him for the first time
the other night.

01:18:03.394 --> 01:18:04.979
Good for her.

01:18:05.146 --> 01:18:06.857
Not really.
He's kind of a knucklehead.

01:18:07.941 --> 01:18:11.446
You should give her a call,
you know, if you want.

01:18:12.238 --> 01:18:13.990
All right, yeah. Maybe I will.

01:18:14.699 --> 01:18:16.535
<i>10-David to 70-David.</i>

01:18:16.702 --> 01:18:19.121
- Word our motorcade has been hit.
- Any damage?

01:18:19.288 --> 01:18:21.458
- "Terry Fargas is dead."
- Damn!

01:18:21.625 --> 01:18:24.294
<i>And we've got two patrol officers
on the table at County.</i>

01:18:24.503 --> 01:18:28.132
- What's your location, 10-David?
- Right on top of you.

01:18:31.762 --> 01:18:34.014
- That's good to know.
- Yeah.

01:18:34.181 --> 01:18:38.311
T.J., stay alert back there.
They're coming out of the woodwork.

01:18:39.855 --> 01:18:42.358
- American greed.
- Shut up.

01:18:42.525 --> 01:18:44.903
- So reliable.
- Shut up!

01:18:45.195 --> 01:18:48.281
Another officer's dead
because you shot your mouth off.

01:18:48.448 --> 01:18:52.078
- That's how I like cops, dead.
- Want to join him?

01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:56.542
He knew the dangers, no?

01:18:56.792 --> 01:18:59.629
That's why he signed up
to be a police officer.

01:18:59.796 --> 01:19:04.343
Carry a gun in the Wild West.
Like you, cowboy.

01:19:05.094 --> 01:19:08.306
Would you be sitting here
if this job wasn't dangerous?

01:19:08.557 --> 01:19:10.267
Anyway...

01:19:10.517 --> 01:19:13.146
...killing him probably
got you 20 new recruits.

01:19:13.312 --> 01:19:14.814
You should thank me.

01:19:15.231 --> 01:19:17.151
Yeah, you're right. I should.

01:19:17.317 --> 01:19:20.946
- Boxer, thank him for me, will you?
- Love to.

01:19:27.413 --> 01:19:30.374
<i>We are coming up
on checkpoint one.</i>

01:19:30.541 --> 01:19:32.627
Roger, Hondo, I see it.

01:19:33.128 --> 01:19:34.379
<i>Making the turn...</i>

01:19:34.588 --> 01:19:36.299
...at checkpoint one.

01:19:44.516 --> 01:19:48.188
- Hardcore, Sanchez.
- I'm watching everyone's hands.

01:19:48.354 --> 01:19:52.193
Empty hand, no weapon,
I'm going home to my little girl, Deke.

01:19:52.693 --> 01:19:54.529
I'm going home to my brats too.

01:19:54.696 --> 01:19:57.282
<i>We're now approaching
checkpoint two.</i>

01:19:57.449 --> 01:19:59.327
T.J., relax, man.

01:19:59.494 --> 01:20:02.955
Hondo transported the president like
this back in '96. No one had a clue.

01:20:04.583 --> 01:20:07.878
Hey, my friends.
I can double my offer.

01:20:08.295 --> 01:20:10.632
Sixty-six million for each of you.

01:20:10.799 --> 01:20:12.801
All you have to do
is let me go right here.

01:20:13.176 --> 01:20:15.888
And don't worry.
I'll find my way home.

01:20:16.305 --> 01:20:18.809
You got the cash?
Because we don't take a check.

01:20:18.975 --> 01:20:22.562
Come on. Be smart about this.
What do you make?

01:20:22.730 --> 01:20:24.524
Sixty-six thousand a year?

01:20:25.942 --> 01:20:27.861
Not even with overtime.

01:20:28.028 --> 01:20:29.321
Loser.

01:20:33.993 --> 01:20:36.831
Making the turn at checkpoint two.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.420
My view of Car Two
has been blocked.

01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:47.343
T.J., what's happening?

01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:51.431
<i>I got a pedestrian in the crosswalk. I'll
be on your tail in about 10 seconds.</i>

01:20:51.598 --> 01:20:52.850
Roger that.

01:20:53.976 --> 01:20:55.895
Hands where I can see them, guys.
Come on.

01:20:56.271 --> 01:20:59.440
- T.J., what the hell are you doing?
- What the hell does it look like?

01:20:59.607 --> 01:21:01.485
I'm taking Frenchie here
up on his offer.

01:21:01.694 --> 01:21:04.446
Now, you guys just be smart.
Hands up, Box! Come on. Come on.

01:21:04.613 --> 01:21:07.993
Hands up! Hands up, Box. Let's go,
let me see it. Hands up! Let's go!

01:21:09.912 --> 01:21:11.831
What the hell was that?

01:21:12.373 --> 01:21:14.501
- What was that, Bri?
- He was going for his piece.

01:21:14.710 --> 01:21:16.420
No, he wasn't! I had it under control!

01:21:16.587 --> 01:21:19.215
- You didn't have to shoot him!
- What do you say, Jimbo?

01:21:19.382 --> 01:21:22.427
- Want to be a cowboy?
- T.J., Street, Boxer!

01:21:22.594 --> 01:21:25.097
- "Car Two, respond!"
- We're catching up to you, sarge.

01:21:25.264 --> 01:21:28.435
- We'll be there in about...
- Officer down! 7 th and Hope!

01:21:28.810 --> 01:21:31.104
- Flip a bitch!
- Flipping a bitch.

01:21:37.236 --> 01:21:38.489
- 10-David!
- Move!

01:21:38.655 --> 01:21:41.366
10-David! Do you have a location
on car number two?

01:21:41.575 --> 01:21:43.036
- Move! Move! Move!
- Roger.

01:21:43.244 --> 01:21:45.413
Car Two is stopped at 7 th and Hope.

01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:48.375
Do me a favor. Tell Fuller
it was me who pulled this off, yeah?

01:21:48.751 --> 01:21:50.878
I'm not gonna let you
get away with this, Gamble.

01:21:51.086 --> 01:21:53.423
Well, you ain't got a say
in the matter, do you?

01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:56.719
<i>Suspects wearing tactical clothing
and have automatic weapons.</i>

01:21:58.971 --> 01:22:00.681
T.J., don't do this!

01:22:02.392 --> 01:22:04.937
I got an officer down! Officer down!
7 th and Hope!

01:22:05.187 --> 01:22:09.108
Suspects are entering
the Pershing Square MTA station.

01:22:22.625 --> 01:22:25.087
- Boxer, hang in there! Hang in there.
- You okay?

01:22:25.254 --> 01:22:27.297
I'm all right. Boxer got hit.

01:22:27.548 --> 01:22:29.425
We're gonna need an ambulance!

01:22:29.592 --> 01:22:31.719
- Who did this?
- It was Gamble.

01:22:31.886 --> 01:22:33.513
- Box!
- Get him up. Get him over!

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:36.016
It was T.J. And Gamble.
They've gone down the subway.

01:22:36.225 --> 01:22:38.143
Let's go hunting.

01:22:41.022 --> 01:22:42.899
- I'm gonna get the kit!
- Take care of him.

01:22:43.066 --> 01:22:45.278
- Yeah.
- Street, let's go!

01:22:45.444 --> 01:22:49.408
This is 73-David. This is 73-David.
I need an RA unit...

01:22:49.575 --> 01:22:52.286
...as soon as possible
to the corner of Hope and 7 th.

01:22:52.494 --> 01:22:55.915
Officer down! I repeat, officer down!

01:23:08.139 --> 01:23:09.515
All right, T., we're in.

01:23:09.682 --> 01:23:11.225
<i>Let's go.</i>

01:23:11.601 --> 01:23:13.228
Hit the juice, grandpa.

01:23:15.856 --> 01:23:17.358
Come on, Box.

01:23:17.525 --> 01:23:19.611
Come on, come on, come on!

01:23:19.777 --> 01:23:21.780
- What do we got?
- Gunshot wound to the neck.

01:23:21.947 --> 01:23:23.490
- Vitals?
- None.

01:23:24.575 --> 01:23:26.661
Come on! Let's go!

01:23:52.442 --> 01:23:54.862
Always one step behind.

01:23:55.571 --> 01:23:57.156
This is 70-David at 7 th and Hope.

01:23:57.323 --> 01:23:59.785
Suspects are on eastbound train
number 5-0-7...

01:23:59.952 --> 01:24:02.287
...headed to Metro Center
at 7 th and Figueroa.

01:24:02.454 --> 01:24:04.165
<i>Have the rail unit contact M TA...</i>

01:24:04.332 --> 01:24:07.293
...and shut it down at the next station.
- Roger that, 70-David.

01:24:08.087 --> 01:24:10.839
What are they gonna do, take
the subway all the way to Mexico?

01:24:11.423 --> 01:24:13.468
Come on,
check for secondary wounds.

01:24:13.635 --> 01:24:17.515
<i>Sanchez! Deke, Sanchez!
Meet that train at the next station.</i>

01:24:17.682 --> 01:24:19.433
73-David, we copy.

01:24:23.564 --> 01:24:25.649
You better be good for it.

01:24:25.816 --> 01:24:29.028
I assure you, if anyone is, it's me.

01:24:45.214 --> 01:24:46.925
I want you to set up a perimeter.

01:24:47.092 --> 01:24:49.845
Nobody comes in the station
and nobody gets off a train.

01:24:50.012 --> 01:24:51.764
Yes, sir. You got it.

01:24:57.146 --> 01:25:00.942
<i>Rail unit, this is 10-David. I've got my
men headed to the Figueroa station.</i>

01:25:01.151 --> 01:25:04.029
- Are you ready to stop that train?
- "Yes, sir."

01:25:24.679 --> 01:25:26.514
- Where's this train?
- Never made it.

01:25:26.681 --> 01:25:27.975
Should've been here by now.

01:25:28.142 --> 01:25:30.853
Sanchez to Hondo.
The train never made it to Figueroa.

01:25:40.907 --> 01:25:43.160
Secure the station. SWAT's got it.

01:26:23.792 --> 01:26:28.840
Got people. Hands up!
Let me see your hands! Now!

01:26:30.593 --> 01:26:32.553
Hands. Hands!

01:26:34.890 --> 01:26:38.059
Hands. Show him your hands.
Hands.

01:26:51.618 --> 01:26:53.203
Where are they?

01:26:53.370 --> 01:26:56.874
- They said they were gonna kill me.
- They're not coming back.

01:26:57.792 --> 01:26:59.502
Down the shaft.

01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:06.385
Where'd they go?

01:27:10.390 --> 01:27:11.893
10-David, this is 70-David.

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:14.771
Suspects have entered
what appears to be a storm drain...

01:27:14.979 --> 01:27:17.358
...approximately a quarter-mile
north of Metro Center.

01:27:17.524 --> 01:27:18.817
<i>Roger that, 70-David.</i>

01:27:18.984 --> 01:27:20.695
We'll deploy above ground
accordingly.

01:27:21.696 --> 01:27:23.782
We're going in after them.

01:27:42.012 --> 01:27:44.224
This shaft intersects
with the storm-drain system.

01:27:44.391 --> 01:27:46.851
They could pop out of any manhole
in a five-mile radius.

01:27:47.018 --> 01:27:48.813
- How many manholes are we talking?
- 6000.

01:27:49.021 --> 01:27:51.899
Six thousand?! I can't cover 6000...

01:27:52.233 --> 01:27:53.610
R-Commander, 10-David.

01:27:53.777 --> 01:27:55.779
<i>Put that airship down
and give me...</i>

01:27:55.946 --> 01:27:58.449
...a command post
at Sixth and Hope Street.

01:27:58.616 --> 01:28:00.118
And give me a landline, Code Two.

01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:13.759
70-David to 10-David.

01:28:14.468 --> 01:28:17.431
70-David to 10-David.

01:28:17.598 --> 01:28:20.100
70-David to 114.
Do you read me?

01:28:22.270 --> 01:28:25.315
70-David to 114.
Do you read me?

01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:29.236
We got no reception
down here.

01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:32.115
Gamble wants us on an island...

01:28:32.574 --> 01:28:34.117
...he's got it.

01:28:34.284 --> 01:28:35.786
Stay alert, guys.

01:28:36.287 --> 01:28:38.164
They went this way.

01:28:46.841 --> 01:28:50.095
- "We have ID'd those suspects."
- Great! Who are they?

01:28:50.262 --> 01:28:53.766
Former Officer Gamble
and Officer T.J. McCabe.

01:28:56.436 --> 01:28:59.315
Gamble, as in Street's
ex-partner Gamble?

01:28:59.482 --> 01:29:00.983
<i>Roger.</i>

01:29:06.490 --> 01:29:08.952
There is some kind
of plan here, right?

01:29:11.204 --> 01:29:13.457
There's your plan, pumpkin.

01:29:13.624 --> 01:29:16.210
We have got two SWAT-trained
guys leading this attack.

01:29:16.377 --> 01:29:18.171
How do we know the rest
aren't in on it?

01:29:18.338 --> 01:29:20.340
Because I can vouch for Hondo.

01:29:20.507 --> 01:29:22.217
Willing to bet $ 100 million on that?

01:29:39.405 --> 01:29:41.115
Bingo.

01:29:52.713 --> 01:29:54.673
You gotta be shitting me.

01:29:56.009 --> 01:29:58.803
If they're good, this is only gonna
slow them down, T.J.

01:29:59.012 --> 01:30:01.348
This was supposed to be simple
snatch and extract.

01:30:01.515 --> 01:30:03.225
- Boxer was a threat.
- He was my friend!

01:30:03.392 --> 01:30:06.730
- He was mine too!
- Stop crying, you can buy new friends.

01:30:07.939 --> 01:30:10.109
Don't give me any more reasons
to kill you.

01:30:10.276 --> 01:30:13.195
What are you going to do,
shoot me?

01:30:15.198 --> 01:30:19.954
You should relax a little bit, my friend.
I'm the money here. Don't forget it.

01:30:21.247 --> 01:30:23.207
We don't have time for this shit.

01:30:23.374 --> 01:30:26.712
Look, you can go ahead.
I know this sucks.

01:30:26.879 --> 01:30:29.299
Let's worry about it in paradise,
all right?

01:30:29.466 --> 01:30:31.551
Come on.

01:30:38.226 --> 01:30:40.103
Have we re-established
contact with Hondo?

01:30:40.270 --> 01:30:44.150
Not yet, sir. 70-David,
advise your location, please.

01:30:44.317 --> 01:30:45.818
70-David, come in.

01:30:45.985 --> 01:30:47.613
Hondo, where the hell are you?

01:30:54.579 --> 01:30:56.539
What's that?

01:31:02.089 --> 01:31:04.091
- It's phosphorescent paint.
- Oh, yeah?

01:31:04.257 --> 01:31:06.636
Keep your eyes on the wall
for more.

01:31:40.302 --> 01:31:43.305
- Gas masks?
- It's just smoke.

01:31:43.471 --> 01:31:45.850
We're gonna have to go in blind.

01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:03.496
What's going on?

01:32:04.331 --> 01:32:07.376
Tripwire. Live mine.

01:32:07.543 --> 01:32:11.547
- Whoa, claymore. Nasty stuff.
- No shit.

01:32:11.714 --> 01:32:13.342
There's an old Indian saying:

01:32:13.842 --> 01:32:16.219
Where there's one white man...

01:32:16.386 --> 01:32:18.389
There's more white men.

01:32:20.850 --> 01:32:24.772
What? Do you hear something?

01:32:25.606 --> 01:32:29.152
No. That's the problem.

01:32:37.788 --> 01:32:39.706
Come on, we gotta move.

01:32:43.211 --> 01:32:45.506
- You all smell like shit.
- That would be a sewer.

01:32:45.673 --> 01:32:48.050
- Where's our air?
- On track and on schedule.

01:32:48.217 --> 01:32:49.844
Wonderful.

01:32:50.011 --> 01:32:52.180
T.J., ride with me.

01:32:53.974 --> 01:32:56.060
Come on, guys, gotta go!

01:32:56.227 --> 01:32:58.646
<i>All units in the vicinity
of the Hawthorne Airport:</i>

01:32:58.814 --> 01:33:02.693
Residents report beacon lights
turned on after closing hours.

01:33:04.404 --> 01:33:06.739
Dispatch, R-Commander.
Deploy all available units...

01:33:06.906 --> 01:33:09.118
...to Hawthorne Airport.
Call the FAA for details.

01:33:09.284 --> 01:33:11.078
They're gonna fly him
out of the country.

01:33:11.245 --> 01:33:14.124
10-David, this is R-Commander. Get
your men there as soon as possible.

01:33:14.290 --> 01:33:15.667
<i>Roger that.</i>

01:33:16.793 --> 01:33:18.671
Unit One, what's your status?

01:33:18.838 --> 01:33:22.426
We are approximately 45 miles
due east of Point Bravo.

01:33:22.926 --> 01:33:26.138
We have begun our descent.
That's a six-minute ETA.

01:33:26.305 --> 01:33:27.598
<i>Roger that.</i>

01:33:42.616 --> 01:33:45.328
- Ain't this a bitch?
- A cold, hard one.

01:33:46.496 --> 01:33:50.460
<i>10-David to R-Commander, we are
approaching Hawthorne Airport.</i>

01:33:54.630 --> 01:34:00.347
- Street! How about the claymore?
- Shit! I'll be back. Deke!

01:34:39.394 --> 01:34:40.812
<i>10-David to R-Commander.</i>

01:34:41.020 --> 01:34:43.273
We have established a perimeter
around the airport.

01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:45.275
Additional SWAT units
are en route.

01:34:47.112 --> 01:34:50.949
Van One, Van Two, you have
less than five minutes.

01:34:53.703 --> 01:34:55.830
Roger that, 10-David.
Any word from Hondo's team?

01:34:56.038 --> 01:35:01.379
- 70-David is still out of radio contact.
- Hondo, you son of a bitch!

01:35:01.546 --> 01:35:03.715
You sure you know
what you're doing?

01:35:04.173 --> 01:35:06.760
Remember when you asked me
what I used to do in the SEALs?

01:35:06.927 --> 01:35:08.762
Oh, yeah.

01:35:10.432 --> 01:35:12.350
All right, clear.

01:35:26.242 --> 01:35:28.036
Fire in the hole.

01:35:33.584 --> 01:35:36.171
<i>10-David, this is 70-David.</i>

01:35:36.588 --> 01:35:38.089
70-David, where the hell are you?

01:35:38.256 --> 01:35:41.010
We are somewhere around
Sixth and Trenton.

01:35:41.177 --> 01:35:43.972
We lost communication in the tunnels.
Where's our backup?

01:35:44.139 --> 01:35:46.224
Hawthorne Airport.
That's where your friends...

01:35:46.433 --> 01:35:48.061
...Gamble and T.J. McCabe
are headed.

01:35:48.728 --> 01:35:51.647
That's the other side of town!
Send a couple units to pick us up.

01:35:51.814 --> 01:35:55.235
<i>Pick you up? For all I know,
you're in on this!</i>

01:35:55.402 --> 01:35:59.324
- "I got a good mind to bring you in."
- Like hell. Come on, let's go.

01:36:04.288 --> 01:36:07.417
- Police! Stop the car!
- Stop the vehicle!

01:36:09.628 --> 01:36:12.006
- Stop the car!
- Stop the car!

01:36:12.173 --> 01:36:15.426
Stop the car!
Exit the car, sir!

01:36:15.802 --> 01:36:18.514
- You guys have to get out of here.
- Police emergency.

01:36:18.681 --> 01:36:21.726
- Wait, I just have kids in the car.
- Well, get them out of there!

01:36:21.893 --> 01:36:24.813
- It's us in the gun cage tomorrow.
- You know how it is, Street.

01:36:24.979 --> 01:36:28.275
Sometimes doing the right thing
ain't doing the right thing.

01:36:40.916 --> 01:36:44.421
- Last car through. Bridge is locked.
- Copy that.

01:36:48.425 --> 01:36:51.762
- I thought you couldn't drive.
- I said I didn't like to.

01:36:51.929 --> 01:36:53.682
Keep getting into accidents.

01:36:55.017 --> 01:36:57.686
Sounds like they're trying
to fly him out of here.

01:36:57.853 --> 01:37:00.273
Why would they turn on the lights
and warn everybody?

01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:02.608
Shit! Gamble's smarter than that.

01:37:02.775 --> 01:37:05.529
There's a full moon. A rookie
could land on a night like this.

01:37:05.696 --> 01:37:07.949
- So why'd they pop up back there?
- I don't know.

01:37:08.116 --> 01:37:10.118
But Fuller's sending all we got
to Hawthorne.

01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:25.928
Did they build a new airport in
downtown in the past couple of days?

01:37:26.095 --> 01:37:27.931
I don't think so, Sanchez.
Why?

01:37:28.432 --> 01:37:33.104
That jet to your right, it's flying
pretty low, and it's only getting lower.

01:37:35.941 --> 01:37:38.402
- That's our boy! That's our boy!
- He's setting down.

01:37:38.569 --> 01:37:41.239
- Yeah, but where?
- I don't know, but follow that jet.

01:37:57.926 --> 01:38:01.305
- How wide is the Sixth Street Bridge?
- It's gotta be four lanes across...

01:38:01.472 --> 01:38:03.265
...sidewalks.
Plane small enough...

01:38:03.432 --> 01:38:06.019
...he might be able to set it down,
if he's got the balls.

01:38:21.538 --> 01:38:23.499
Reducing speed.

01:38:23.666 --> 01:38:26.085
This is 70-David. That plane's
not coming to Hawthorne.

01:38:26.293 --> 01:38:28.839
I gave you a direct order
to stand down, sergeant.

01:38:29.005 --> 01:38:30.424
<i>And I would have, Tom...</i>

01:38:30.632 --> 01:38:33.594
...except I saw a Learjet about to land
on the Sixth Street Bridge.

01:38:34.887 --> 01:38:37.599
- Give me 40 percent flaps.
- Forty percent flaps, check.

01:38:37.808 --> 01:38:41.896
Sir, we have reports of a low-flying
aircraft in the downtown area.

01:38:42.063 --> 01:38:45.692
- Where's the nearest backup?
- Five, six minutes.

01:38:45.859 --> 01:38:49.655
I don't think you're feeling me
on this, Tom. We're going in.

01:39:02.421 --> 01:39:03.589
Oh, God!

01:39:10.973 --> 01:39:12.767
- Reverse thrust.
- Roger that. Full brake.

01:39:14.435 --> 01:39:15.979
This guy's worth every penny.

01:39:48.143 --> 01:39:51.563
All right, let's turn this plane around.

01:39:54.234 --> 01:39:58.864
<i>10-David, we just got a report a plane
has landed on the Sixth Street Bridge.</i>

01:39:59.073 --> 01:40:00.741
They what?

01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:02.202
Let's mount up!

01:40:02.411 --> 01:40:04.121
All right, give me a car
downstairs now.

01:40:16.428 --> 01:40:20.181
- What? What's going on?
- Just got room for one of you.

01:40:20.599 --> 01:40:23.060
- I'm not going without my wife!
- Well then, don't.

01:40:23.269 --> 01:40:25.272
No! No, no, no. Richard!

01:40:25.439 --> 01:40:27.899
- Jesus Christ!
- Richard! Richard...

01:40:28.108 --> 01:40:30.486
Richard is gone,
so sit down and shut up!

01:40:30.653 --> 01:40:33.030
Twenty seconds!
See you in Margaritaville.

01:40:33.740 --> 01:40:36.452
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Please, just let me go.

01:40:36.618 --> 01:40:38.203
- Please, let me go!
- Shut her up!

01:40:38.412 --> 01:40:40.373
- Come on!
- Shut the hell up!

01:40:40.582 --> 01:40:42.500
Get us in the air.

01:40:43.001 --> 01:40:45.379
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, let's go home.

01:40:45.546 --> 01:40:48.257
Oh, look. They've got
their own airport security.

01:41:01.815 --> 01:41:04.319
You've got company!
Limo broke containment!

01:41:04.486 --> 01:41:06.613
All right, we got you covered, man.

01:41:14.664 --> 01:41:16.333
Just keep coming.

01:41:20.379 --> 01:41:22.132
Boom.

01:41:24.176 --> 01:41:25.969
Son of a bitch!

01:41:35.231 --> 01:41:36.733
Here.

01:41:38.110 --> 01:41:40.863
- What's this?
- Well, that'd be a cell phone.

01:41:41.072 --> 01:41:43.491
That's the account where
I want the money transferred.

01:41:43.658 --> 01:41:46.537
The bank verifies the transfer,
goddamn if you ain't a free man.

01:41:46.703 --> 01:41:48.956
<i>70-David, be advised
there are hostages onboard.</i>

01:41:49.123 --> 01:41:50.750
All right, you heard the man.

01:41:50.917 --> 01:41:52.377
- Deke!
- Yo!

01:41:52.544 --> 01:41:55.214
They get that plane off the ground,
those hostages are dead.

01:41:55.381 --> 01:41:58.300
I need your A-game,
boys and girl.

01:42:07.895 --> 01:42:09.731
- What's going on?
- Get them off our asses!

01:42:09.898 --> 01:42:11.525
Just fly the plane. Open the hatch.

01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:13.736
- Come on!
- Open the hatch!

01:42:24.666 --> 01:42:26.168
Hang on!
Here's where watching...

01:42:26.334 --> 01:42:29.839
<i>... The World's Most Exciting
"Police Chases" pays off.</i>

01:42:32.843 --> 01:42:34.136
I got no shot!

01:42:38.099 --> 01:42:39.642
Get this thing in the air!

01:42:40.435 --> 01:42:42.146
Come on!

01:42:44.190 --> 01:42:45.984
Shut that goddamn door!

01:43:20.442 --> 01:43:23.488
- Damn it!
- I hope you got a plan B, brother.

01:43:25.198 --> 01:43:27.367
You stay there. You're fine.

01:43:55.985 --> 01:43:59.448
- Gamble! Let her go!
- Take a shot, Jimbo!

01:44:06.707 --> 01:44:08.709
- Sanchez is down!
- Sanchez.

01:44:13.381 --> 01:44:14.841
Go get him.

01:44:17.428 --> 01:44:18.596
Give me more ammo!

01:44:23.477 --> 01:44:24.771
Deke! Frog's running!

01:44:24.937 --> 01:44:27.398
- Are you okay?
- I'm all right, man.

01:44:39.455 --> 01:44:42.333
- Sorry, ma'am. I gotta go too.
- No.

01:44:53.096 --> 01:44:54.640
Tell Daddy how you want it.

01:45:22.632 --> 01:45:24.759
You're like a goddamn rash!

01:45:30.475 --> 01:45:33.145
You might want to
get that looked at, brother.

01:45:49.248 --> 01:45:51.709
- How's Boxer?
- What do you care?

01:45:51.876 --> 01:45:54.004
Come on, Hondo. Just give me that.

01:45:55.088 --> 01:45:56.381
He's gonna make it.

01:45:57.549 --> 01:45:58.801
Good.

01:45:59.635 --> 01:46:01.471
Just couldn't resist, could you?

01:46:03.557 --> 01:46:05.642
So, what do you want to do?

01:46:09.230 --> 01:46:11.316
Goddamn it, sarge.

01:48:04.161 --> 01:48:06.664
There's one in the chamber, partner.

01:48:09.792 --> 01:48:11.587
Come on.

01:49:02.774 --> 01:49:05.193
- So how's Boxer?
- Got word he's gonna pull through.

01:49:05.402 --> 01:49:07.029
That's great.

01:49:08.656 --> 01:49:10.700
Remind me to buy
some shares in KEVLAR.

01:49:10.908 --> 01:49:12.911
Good work, Sanchez.

01:49:14.037 --> 01:49:15.832
You look like you need a Band-Aid.

01:49:15.999 --> 01:49:18.376
Somebody else
needs a body bag downstairs.

01:49:20.086 --> 01:49:22.756
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

01:49:22.923 --> 01:49:24.842
- Good stuff.
- Nice job.

01:49:25.427 --> 01:49:27.345
Don't sound so happy.

01:49:28.388 --> 01:49:32.018
Still got a problem.
He's still here.

01:49:37.524 --> 01:49:38.775
Road trip?

01:49:40.737 --> 01:49:43.656
- Road trip.
- Yeah.

01:49:44.074 --> 01:49:47.286
Road trip. Guess you'll
have to fire us later.

01:49:56.839 --> 01:49:59.426
Transferring custody
of L.A. Police Department prisoner...

01:49:59.635 --> 01:50:02.972
...number 109672
into federal custody.

01:50:03.139 --> 01:50:06.309
Thank you, sir.
I will accept the transfer.

01:50:12.859 --> 01:50:14.402
Enjoy your new home.

01:50:19.825 --> 01:50:22.329
Try your best
to get to know the guys.

01:50:22.996 --> 01:50:26.459
Yeah, 100 mil ought to buy you
a nice husband in there.

01:50:43.229 --> 01:50:45.399
Where to, boys?

01:50:48.443 --> 01:50:50.405
Home sounds like a winner.

01:50:54.117 --> 01:50:56.996
Girls like you get guys
like me in trouble.

01:50:57.538 --> 01:51:00.250
You think I should've taken
the $100 million?

01:51:01.126 --> 01:51:04.130
<i>All units, we have a 211 in progress
at the Diamond Mart...</i>

01:51:04.338 --> 01:51:06.757
<i>... 43 S. Hope Street.
Shots fired.</i>

01:51:06.924 --> 01:51:09.845
Technically, our watch
has been over for 12 hours.

01:51:10.053 --> 01:51:11.680
So?

01:51:15.685 --> 01:51:17.353
Yeah.

01:51:17.812 --> 01:51:19.732
What the hell.

01:51:20.399 --> 01:51:22.193
Mount up!
