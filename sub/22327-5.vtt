[Jenny] 3326.

00:14.431 --> 00:18.643
Access memory chain 71985VX.

00:20.645 --> 00:21.896
Write it down.

00:54.220 --> 00:55.346
That's all of it?

00:55.430 --> 00:57.515
[marker squeaks echoing]

00:57.599 --> 00:59.768
[echoing] Philip, is that all of it?

00:59.851 --> 01:01.269
Is it error-free?

01:03.229 --> 01:04.064
Yes.

01:04.856 --> 01:05.690
Is it good?

01:06.900 --> 01:08.234
It's great. Can you move?

01:09.569 --> 01:10.570
[camera shutter snaps]

01:10.653 --> 01:11.738
[knock on door]

01:15.700 --> 01:17.327
[door opens]

01:17.410 --> 01:18.620
[Jenny] How did you get in?

01:18.703 --> 01:21.081
-Little girl named Chloe.
-I said I would send it to you.

01:21.164 --> 01:23.875
Yeah, well, something like this
I have to see for myself.

01:24.375 --> 01:27.128
These stereoisomers are going
to be difficult to reproduce.

01:27.212 --> 01:28.755
We're going to have to do it in batches.

01:28.838 --> 01:30.965
-[camera shutter snaps]
-[Jenny] We're leaving.

01:31.049 --> 01:33.426
[Traveler D13 echoing]
Sure. Good work, Philip.

01:49.651 --> 01:52.487
Ohh, God.

01:54.572 --> 01:56.407
What did we do last night?

01:56.491 --> 01:58.701
We were going to your place.

01:58.785 --> 01:59.619
We did.

02:01.371 --> 02:02.872
We did? [chuckles]

02:04.541 --> 02:06.668
Uh... [chuckles]

02:06.751 --> 02:08.378
This is disturbing.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.338
You hit the drops pretty hard.

02:10.421 --> 02:11.422
Mm...

02:12.757 --> 02:14.592
It's never felt like this before.

02:16.052 --> 02:17.095
[Jenny] It'll pass.

02:18.346 --> 02:19.556
We need to talk.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.183
This has to end.

02:22.267 --> 02:23.101
What?

02:24.144 --> 02:25.979
This. Us.

02:29.107 --> 02:30.108
What?

02:30.191 --> 02:31.985
I got a new mission.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.320
What mission?

02:34.404 --> 02:36.865
Sorry, Philip, lightning struck.

02:38.992 --> 02:42.453
So goodbye?
We never see each other again?

02:43.830 --> 02:47.041
I... I thought we had a connection.

02:47.625 --> 02:49.627
Right. I'm your connection.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.422
That's not what I meant.

02:55.174 --> 02:56.593
Should last you a few months,

02:56.676 --> 02:58.553
if you use them the way
you're supposed to.

03:03.683 --> 03:04.517
Jenny!

03:05.351 --> 03:06.185
Jenny!

03:06.269 --> 03:07.687
[door closes]

03:27.373 --> 03:29.626
-[Jeffrey Jr. crying]
-[Carly] Okay, it's almost over.

03:29.709 --> 03:30.543
[thermometer beeps]

03:30.627 --> 03:32.045
100.6.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.881
It's high, but manageable.

03:34.964 --> 03:37.550
[Carly] Oh, I know, I know,
I know, I know.

03:37.634 --> 03:41.137
Okay, so, um,
alternate between these two--

03:41.221 --> 03:43.056
acetaminophen and ibuprofen.

03:43.139 --> 03:46.851
Should manage his fever
or whatever pain he might be in.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.269
[Carly] That's it?

03:48.353 --> 03:50.188
That's it.
He should be fine in a few days.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.566
I know. You hear that, baby?

03:53.650 --> 03:55.902
Auntie Marcy says
you're gonna be all right.

03:55.985 --> 03:57.278
[Carly sighs]

03:57.862 --> 03:58.988
Stay for coffee?

03:59.072 --> 04:00.365
Uh, sure.

04:00.448 --> 04:01.282
Okay.

04:01.366 --> 04:02.784
I'm just gonna put him down.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.663
[Jeffrey Jr. crying]

04:32.480 --> 04:33.356
[Trevor] Philip.

04:36.609 --> 04:37.819
You've been quiet lately.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.446
Yeah, not much to say.

04:41.698 --> 04:45.201
Some people find talking about it
to be therapeutic.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.036
It's been two weeks.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.540
You know it doesn't
make a difference for me, right?

04:51.291 --> 04:53.501
I remember every detail
as if it just happened.

04:53.584 --> 04:55.044
Okay. Good chat.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.337
[Trevor clears throat]

04:58.715 --> 04:59.549
Who is it?

04:59.632 --> 05:01.259
[Trevor] 0115!

05:01.342 --> 05:03.344
[Philip] 3326.

05:04.721 --> 05:08.057
We were given orders to meet you.
You must be Graham.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.267
Yeah, come on in.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.814
You boys hungry? I got soup on.

05:14.897 --> 05:16.149
No, thank you.

05:16.232 --> 05:19.235
Smells delicious. You have a lovely home.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.737
[Graham] Well, just temporary.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.989
Driving up and down the state
making handoffs.

05:23.072 --> 05:24.282
[Philip] A long mission.

05:24.365 --> 05:27.243
Rollout's been longer than expected.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.163
But I ain't complainin'.
Got to see three eagles.

05:30.246 --> 05:31.080
[Colleen chuckles]

05:31.164 --> 05:32.707
Hopefully you're done soon.

05:32.790 --> 05:35.043
Yeah, well, your team's one of the last
on the list.

05:35.126 --> 05:36.961
[Graham coughing]

05:38.046 --> 05:39.297
Excuse me.

05:40.256 --> 05:41.090
Here you go.

05:50.391 --> 05:51.934
[Trevor] What a lovely couple.

05:56.147 --> 05:58.566
Thank you for coming and checking him out.

05:58.649 --> 06:00.276
I know I probably sounded crazy.

06:00.359 --> 06:01.778
No, you don't sound crazy.

06:01.861 --> 06:04.864
You had a... a natural maternal instinct.

06:04.947 --> 06:06.115
[Carly chuckles]

06:06.199 --> 06:07.033
[coffee mugs clink]

06:07.116 --> 06:08.659
I don't know about natural.

06:08.743 --> 06:10.495
It's not like I'm really his mother.

06:10.578 --> 06:13.998
Yeah, you are, in every way
that means something.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.626
You guys have bonded.

06:17.919 --> 06:20.004
Who'd have thought that'd happen
to someone like me?

06:20.088 --> 06:22.048
[chuckles] You mean a soldier?

06:23.382 --> 06:25.134
Maybe you've changed.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.427
Maybe we all have.

06:27.595 --> 06:32.141
I mean, I have to believe that
we're more than just our consciousness.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.060
At least the one that we came here with.

06:34.811 --> 06:38.481
You know, maybe that's--
maybe that's the better part of us.

06:38.564 --> 06:41.901
It's funny. You said something like that
the night that you...

06:43.361 --> 06:44.195
um...

06:45.863 --> 06:46.781
What?

06:48.950 --> 06:50.701
The night that I was reset?

06:51.661 --> 06:52.495
What did I say?

06:55.498 --> 06:56.749
Mac didn't tell you.

06:56.833 --> 06:59.043
Well, he said it was the only way
to save my life.

06:59.627 --> 07:00.628
It was.

07:01.796 --> 07:04.340
Well, I really didn't have
any choice, then.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.344
You thought you did.

07:08.427 --> 07:11.347
But what does that mean?

07:15.268 --> 07:17.770
-I shouldn't have said anything.
-No. Carly...

07:19.981 --> 07:22.275
We just didn't know it was going
to happen so fast.

07:24.068 --> 07:25.862
Are you saying it happened
against my will?

07:26.946 --> 07:28.030
I don't know.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.701
We thought you had more time.

07:31.784 --> 07:32.785
So did you.

07:32.869 --> 07:37.331
You said you wanted to go home
because you wanted to think about it.

07:38.666 --> 07:41.210
Well, what could there possibly be
to think about?

07:41.294 --> 07:42.503
I mean, I'd be dead.

07:43.337 --> 07:44.589
I know.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.299
That's what I said at the time.

07:47.675 --> 07:49.302
Now I'm beginning to understand.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.690
This is exactly how it happened last time.

08:02.773 --> 08:03.608
Kat.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.402
You've been taking your medication.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.155
You've done everything by the book.
It's gonna be all right.

08:09.238 --> 08:10.865
Oh, stop saying that.

08:12.867 --> 08:14.452
[door opens]

08:14.535 --> 08:17.538
Hi. Apologies.
The, uh, the printer was down.

08:18.915 --> 08:19.749
How are we?

08:23.336 --> 08:26.839
Kathryn, the, uh, latest ultrasound,

08:26.923 --> 08:28.925
it looks good, looks really good.

08:29.008 --> 08:31.260
The dark spot's completely gone,

08:31.344 --> 08:34.931
which means that it was probably nothing
or maybe just a mistake with the scan.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.350
You and the baby are fine.

08:41.312 --> 08:42.396
I'm sorry.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.194
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

08:48.277 --> 08:52.281
Now, I want you to stick to
the calcium-rich food, the folic acid...

08:52.365 --> 08:54.492
-Okay.
-...and I'll see you in a few weeks.

08:54.575 --> 08:55.409
[soft chuckle] Okay.

08:55.493 --> 08:56.327
Thanks.

08:56.410 --> 08:57.954
Okay.

08:59.914 --> 09:00.831
Thank you.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.752
[relieved laughter]

09:09.966 --> 09:12.176
[Kat sighs]

09:14.053 --> 09:16.556
-[door opens]
-[MacLaren grunts]

09:18.391 --> 09:19.725
What was in the package?

09:19.809 --> 09:21.060
An antiviral.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.689
Historically, this is the beginning
of a minor flu outbreak

09:24.772 --> 09:26.732
that kills 70,000 people worldwide.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.192
Does not sound minor to me.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.987
Percentage-wise, we're not wired
to think in billions of people.

09:31.070 --> 09:34.740
[Philip] Over a few months, an antigenic
shift allows the virus to mutate,

09:34.824 --> 09:36.409
infecting more of the population.

09:36.492 --> 09:39.412
Eventually, the CDC and the WHO
get it under control.

09:39.495 --> 09:42.915
Must be why they provided
a broad spectrum antiviral.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.835
This will inhibit the development
of each of its mutations.

09:45.918 --> 09:49.422
Our mission is to save three of the people
who historically don't make it.

09:49.505 --> 09:50.756
Are there any more?

09:50.840 --> 09:53.092
Jeffrey's already been through
the worst of it.

09:53.175 --> 09:55.219
You need to protect yourself.

09:55.303 --> 09:57.597
[grunts] Couldn't we
have gotten the pill version?

09:58.472 --> 09:59.807
These are the host candidates?

09:59.890 --> 10:02.768
Jordan Lam, Annie Kapoor
and Brittney Palmer.

10:04.103 --> 10:07.231
A personal trainer, a flight attendant,
and a travel blogger.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.317
Prime hosts that must have
spread the virus.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.777
Well, let's make sure that doesn't happen.

[pedestrians chatter]

You gonna do the whole class?

10:46.062 --> 10:48.439
Just waiting for the right opportunity.

10:51.275 --> 10:54.362
Hi, Brittney.
I'll be doing your vaccinations today.

10:54.445 --> 10:56.280
-Okay.
-So you can take a seat.

11:03.871 --> 11:06.749
[siren blares]

11:16.967 --> 11:19.470
[trainer] Yeah, you want
to focus on your obliques.

11:54.255 --> 11:56.424
That's it. Have fun in Europe.

11:56.507 --> 11:57.675
[Brittney] Thanks.

12:04.932 --> 12:06.892
No, mein asthma.

God!

12:35.838 --> 12:37.047
Stung by a freakin' bee.

12:37.131 --> 12:38.674
Me too, I think.

12:38.757 --> 12:40.092
Are you allergic?

12:40.176 --> 12:41.719
No, I'm not.

12:41.802 --> 12:42.636
Good.

12:46.974 --> 12:49.852
[newscaster]
Authorities are advising the public

12:49.935 --> 12:52.438
to avoid large crowds if possible,

12:52.521 --> 12:55.191
as reports are increasing
of an unknown flu strain

12:55.274 --> 12:58.277
that seems to be rapidly spreading
throughout the country.

12:58.819 --> 13:01.447
The World Health Organization
describes the condition

13:01.530 --> 13:05.910
as atypical influenza and confirms
five cases have been reported...

13:05.993 --> 13:07.286
It's starting.

13:08.746 --> 13:12.750
Nice work, everybody.
Protocol five till further notice.

13:12.833 --> 13:15.252
[newscaster]  ...handwashing is
the most effective way

13:15.336 --> 13:17.129
to prevent the spread of the disease.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.964
[vehicle starts]

13:21.008 --> 13:22.009
We need to talk.

13:23.219 --> 13:24.053
Hello, Miss Day.

13:24.136 --> 13:26.055
When's the last time you heard
from the Director?

13:26.138 --> 13:27.181
The school board director?

13:27.264 --> 13:29.350
What are you talking about?
You're worried about them?

13:29.433 --> 13:32.311
Please! There's literally nothing
going on inside their tiny brains.

13:32.394 --> 13:34.647
The girls are thinking about
their insipid friendships,

13:34.730 --> 13:36.273
and the boys are imagining them naked.

13:37.983 --> 13:39.151
What do you want?

13:39.235 --> 13:41.570
[emphatically]
Have you heard from the Director?

13:41.654 --> 13:43.447
Yeah, we've had missions.

13:43.531 --> 13:44.949
[phone message sound]

13:45.032 --> 13:46.909
Well, why haven't I heard anything?

13:46.992 --> 13:49.912
I don't know. Maybe because
you jumped here without permission

13:49.995 --> 13:51.914
and maybe because you don't
have a team.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.792
Maybe I can join your team.
I can be your computer expert.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.335
We already have a computer expert.

13:56.418 --> 13:58.379
I can be your vastly more capable
computer expert.

13:58.462 --> 14:01.215
-It doesn't work like that.
-Well, it should. I'm getting bored.

14:01.298 --> 14:02.967
[phone beeping]

14:03.050 --> 14:04.260
You gonna finish that?

14:05.344 --> 14:06.345
Wow.

14:08.847 --> 14:11.475
Mmm. Fake chicken.

14:11.559 --> 14:12.977
[Trevor chuckles]

14:16.480 --> 14:17.523
Mmm!

14:17.606 --> 14:19.275
[email alert sounds]

14:19.358 --> 14:22.111
Hey, have you seen my, uh,
my work jacket?

14:22.194 --> 14:24.530
You were supposed to take
Jeffrey today.

14:24.613 --> 14:27.575
I know that, but I just got called in.
There's this big bug going around.

14:27.658 --> 14:28.492
So?

14:30.077 --> 14:31.579
So I'm going to work.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.417
What'd I say?

14:36.500 --> 14:38.127
It's what you didn't say.

14:40.796 --> 14:43.674
"Hey, Carly, I know I was supposed
to take Jeffrey today,

14:43.757 --> 14:45.885
but something came up.
Can you help?"

14:45.968 --> 14:49.263
But why do I have to say all of that?
You're his mother.

14:49.346 --> 14:51.181
And you're his father.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.392
You said we were gonna
do this together.

14:53.475 --> 14:55.060
Equal partners, remember?

14:59.732 --> 15:03.360
Carly Shannon, would you
please help me out

15:03.444 --> 15:06.196
by taking our gorgeous son
to the babysitter's house

15:06.280 --> 15:08.282
so that I can go to work as an underpaid,

15:08.365 --> 15:11.702
underappreciated beat cop one more day?

15:15.789 --> 15:18.876
Fine. But you're doing pickups
for the rest of the week.

15:18.959 --> 15:20.294
Absolutely.

15:21.128 --> 15:23.172
Your jacket's on the hook by the door.

15:24.506 --> 15:25.466
Thank you.

15:26.634 --> 15:27.676
See you, little man.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.304
I'll see you, uh, see you tonight.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.185
Hey, you want your ducky?

15:38.354 --> 15:39.772
Yeah, you do.

15:40.564 --> 15:42.566
[chuckling]

15:42.650 --> 15:43.859
Oh, where you taking him?

15:44.944 --> 15:46.570
[Carly laughing]

16:08.759 --> 16:09.593
[Philip] Hello?

16:09.677 --> 16:12.137
[Boyd]  3185.
Has your team taken the antiviral?

16:12.221 --> 16:13.514
-[Philip] Yeah.
-Okay, let us in.

16:13.597 --> 16:14.807
[beeping]

16:21.855 --> 16:22.856
Oop!

16:26.652 --> 16:28.362
[coughing]

16:28.445 --> 16:30.656
[coughs] Where's Marcy?

17:04.356 --> 17:06.525
[dial tones beeping]

17:10.863 --> 17:13.490
[David]  Hi, this is David Mailer.
Please leave a message.

17:13.574 --> 17:14.575
[beeps]

17:14.658 --> 17:17.870
Hi, David. Um, it's me, Marcy.

17:17.953 --> 17:21.123
Just wondering if you wanted
to maybe get together to talk.

17:21.206 --> 17:23.375
[Philip, over comm]
Marcy, you there?

17:23.459 --> 17:27.629
Uh, so, if-- if you'd like to,
just give me a call back.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.173
Okay, bye.

17:29.256 --> 17:30.591
[Philip]  Marcy.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.512
[sighs] Yeah, Philip, go ahead.

17:35.596 --> 17:38.474
[Philip]  We need you at Ops.
Boyd showed up with one of her teammates.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.100
What's happening?

17:40.184 --> 17:43.437
I don't know, she said
it's some kind of viral infection.

17:43.520 --> 17:46.732
[newscaster]  There's growing concern for
an outbreak of a new type of flu strain

17:46.815 --> 17:50.027
that has infected
a number of people in recent days.

17:50.110 --> 17:52.029
While much is still unknown
about the virus...

17:52.112 --> 17:53.405
Hey, Sarge.

17:54.406 --> 17:55.741
I never got my assignment.

17:55.824 --> 17:57.242
Connicker, what are you doing here?

17:57.326 --> 17:58.368
I'm filling in.

17:58.452 --> 18:01.121
Yeah, right.
This flu is kicking us around.

18:01.205 --> 18:02.247
You got your shot yet?

18:02.331 --> 18:03.332
No, not yet.

18:03.415 --> 18:04.458
Well, you better get on it.

18:05.292 --> 18:06.710
You covering McAllister or Boyd?

18:06.794 --> 18:07.711
McAllister.

18:08.712 --> 18:09.922
Hospital.

18:13.300 --> 18:14.593
[coughs]

18:14.676 --> 18:16.970
[newscaster]  ...death toll is
much lower than a normal flu,

18:17.054 --> 18:21.225
Health authorities are expressing concern
over the intensity of the symptoms

18:21.308 --> 18:24.061
and the speed at which
the virus seems to be spreading.

18:24.144 --> 18:25.771
[Marcy]  So, it presents like classic flu:

18:25.854 --> 18:27.272
fever, sore throat, headache.

18:27.356 --> 18:28.982
[Boyd] Yeah, but it's not the flu.

18:29.066 --> 18:31.652
He received the same broad spectrum
antiviral we all did.

18:31.735 --> 18:33.695
So, a virus that's not the flu.

18:33.779 --> 18:37.032
Um... meningitis, West Nile?

18:37.116 --> 18:38.826
[Boyd sighs] I checked those.

18:38.909 --> 18:41.328
I checked them all, actually.
There's no match.

18:42.037 --> 18:42.871
[Marcy] Well...

18:42.955 --> 18:45.040
[Boyd coughs]

18:45.124 --> 18:47.584
[Marcy] Okay, if it's a virus,
we can identify which one it is.

18:47.668 --> 18:50.546
[sighs] I checked every gene sequence
for every virus

18:50.629 --> 18:53.006
in the 21st
and every century after that.

18:53.090 --> 18:55.008
Are you saying that it's
a new pathogen?

18:55.092 --> 18:57.803
Yeah. Unknown in this time or in ours.

18:57.886 --> 18:59.513
[Marcy] How is that even possible?

18:59.596 --> 19:02.015
[Boyd coughs]

19:03.809 --> 19:08.564
[groaning]

19:16.071 --> 19:18.073
[Trevor] O my love! My wife!

19:20.367 --> 19:23.328
Death, that hath sucked
the honey of thy breath...

19:24.580 --> 19:26.748
hath had no power yet
upon thy beauty.

19:26.832 --> 19:28.041
[students giggle]

19:28.125 --> 19:30.878
[teacher] Seriously, you guys!
How old are you?

19:32.171 --> 19:33.255
Go ahead, Trevor.

19:34.381 --> 19:35.799
...upon thy beauty.

19:36.967 --> 19:38.385
Thou art not conquered.

19:39.386 --> 19:43.307
Beauty's ensign yet is crimson
in thy lips and in thy cheeks,

19:43.390 --> 19:44.516
and death's pale flag.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.060
[Marcy]  Trevor, you there?

19:47.144 --> 19:48.520
-[comm beeps]
-Hey.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.439
[students laugh]

19:50.522 --> 19:53.150
[teacher] Good!
Okay, okay, let's take it from, um...

19:53.233 --> 19:54.693
Are you in class?

19:54.776 --> 19:55.611
[Trevor] Mm-hmm.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.446
"...Dear Juliet,
why art thou yet so fair?"

19:57.529 --> 20:00.449
[Marcy]  You need to leave. You might be
infected with a dangerous pathogen.

20:00.532 --> 20:02.951
Just keep your distance
from other people and get outside.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.453
-What's happening?
- Just go, now.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.496
We're skipping to the last section.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.916
"One final embrace, one last kiss."

20:08.999 --> 20:11.168
[Marcy]  Just go, now.
MacLaren's waiting for you.

20:11.251 --> 20:12.753
I gotta go.

20:12.836 --> 20:15.255
[teacher] You don't have to kiss.
Just read.

20:15.339 --> 20:19.259
Hey, don't-- don't touch me!
I'm sorry, I gotta go!

20:28.227 --> 20:29.853
Hardly even looks like a virus.

20:29.937 --> 20:32.773
No, you kind of expect
something pleomorphic.

20:32.856 --> 20:35.192
Spherical capsid, radial symmetry...

20:35.275 --> 20:36.985
This what's infected us?

20:37.069 --> 20:39.363
That's what we're trying to determine.

20:39.446 --> 20:41.073
[door opens]

20:41.156 --> 20:43.242
Oh, good, I need blood
from both of you.

20:43.325 --> 20:44.576
What do you call it?

20:44.660 --> 20:46.119
[Boyd] We haven't got that far yet.

20:46.203 --> 20:48.789
Boyd's viral count is up
in the hundreds of thousands.

20:48.872 --> 20:51.375
Her teammate's up over a million. Here.

20:51.458 --> 20:54.086
Seems to be tied
to the antiviral mission somehow.

20:54.169 --> 20:55.879
We got it two weeks before you did.

20:55.963 --> 20:58.423
Heath's immune system
was already compromised.

20:58.507 --> 21:01.885
I had to remove one of his lungs after
a mission blew up near the beginning.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.137
His antibodies show
no cross-reactivity.

21:04.221 --> 21:05.847
His body just keeps amplifying it.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.307
So, how do we get it under control?

21:07.391 --> 21:09.184
[monitor chiming]

21:09.268 --> 21:11.645
[Boyd] Heath? Little help? Guys?

21:12.729 --> 21:15.524
Okay, we need to sedate him.
Keep holding him down.

21:19.861 --> 21:21.446
[flatline]

21:21.530 --> 21:23.073
[Boyd] I can't get a BP.

21:23.156 --> 21:24.533
There's no pulse.

21:24.616 --> 21:27.244
One, two, three, four, five,

21:27.327 --> 21:30.664
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

21:30.747 --> 21:33.000
11, 12, 13, 14,

21:33.083 --> 21:35.210
15, 16, 17, 18, 19...

21:35.294 --> 21:36.503
Stop CPR.

21:36.586 --> 21:38.505
[beeping]

21:38.588 --> 21:40.424
-One, two, three, four...
-[Boyd] He's gone.

21:40.507 --> 21:41.967
...five, six, seven...

21:42.050 --> 21:43.510
eight, nine, ten.

21:43.593 --> 21:45.804
-One, two, three, four...
-No, he's gone.

21:45.887 --> 21:48.348
Marcy. Marcy. He's gone.

21:48.432 --> 21:51.852
[beeping]

22:06.533 --> 22:07.534
[MacLaren] I'm sorry.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.163
Come on.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.709
Let's get you off your feet.
You need some rest.

22:15.792 --> 22:17.711
I think it's a little late for that.

22:18.712 --> 22:19.755
[MacLaren sighs]

22:26.762 --> 22:30.682
So... how's it looking?

22:33.185 --> 22:34.478
We're all infected, aren't we?

22:38.231 --> 22:39.274
Not all.

22:41.985 --> 22:44.154
You, Philip, and Carly have it.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.074
You and I somehow rejected the virus.

22:47.157 --> 22:48.325
What?

22:48.408 --> 22:50.452
Each of your blood samples
has a viral load

22:50.535 --> 22:53.914
between 500 and a thousand copies
per milliliter. Ours is zero.

22:53.997 --> 22:55.082
What about antibodies?

22:55.165 --> 22:57.292
Trace amounts. Somehow we're immune.

22:57.375 --> 22:58.752
How is that possible?

22:58.835 --> 23:00.962
It's hard to say,
without running more tests.

23:01.046 --> 23:03.548
So, if we're immune,
can't you create a blood serum?

23:03.632 --> 23:05.967
We'll try, but we
might be running out of time.

23:06.051 --> 23:08.595
This started with the mission.
We can't be the only ones.

23:08.678 --> 23:11.640
Check the deep web for any other teams
reporting the same symptoms.

23:11.723 --> 23:14.684
[Marcy] If it's transmitted
through air particles and fomites,

23:14.768 --> 23:16.019
that means there's a good chance

23:16.103 --> 23:18.438
you've infected everyone you've come
into contact with.

23:18.522 --> 23:20.065
Are you sure?

23:20.148 --> 23:22.067
[Marcy] Outside of an immunity,

23:22.150 --> 23:24.736
we're predicting an infection rate
of over 40%.

23:24.820 --> 23:25.654
[MacLaren] Forty?

23:25.737 --> 23:30.117
Call everyone you've come into
contact with. Tell them to stay inside.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.077
Boss, you're gonna wanna see this.

23:32.160 --> 23:34.871
Traveler teams from around the world
are reporting the same sickness.

23:36.498 --> 23:37.332
[Marcy sighs]

23:37.416 --> 23:39.334
They've been transmitting it
this whole time.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.712
If I get you more of the antiviral,
can you analyze it,

23:42.796 --> 23:44.256
see what went wrong?

23:44.339 --> 23:46.842
Possibly. But I'm running low
on ethidium bromide.

23:46.925 --> 23:48.343
It's a controlled substance.

23:48.426 --> 23:50.262
It's not something you can get
on short notice.

23:50.345 --> 23:52.931
-What about your hospital?
-[Marcy] Yeah, the lab should have some.

23:53.014 --> 23:54.182
Um, I'll text you a name.

23:54.266 --> 23:58.186
All right, you two track down the team
that handed off the vials.

23:58.270 --> 23:59.229
I'll go to the hospital.

23:59.312 --> 24:01.148
[Carly] I gotta get my son
from the babysitter.

24:01.231 --> 24:03.024
Carly, you're infected.

24:03.108 --> 24:07.445
The best thing that you can do
for Jeffrey right now is stay away.

24:16.663 --> 24:19.124
[Marcy, on recording]
Hi, David, um, it's me, Marcy.

24:19.207 --> 24:22.043
Just wondering if you wanted
to maybe get together to talk.

24:22.127 --> 24:26.089
Uh, so, if-- if you'd like to,
just give me a call back.

24:26.173 --> 24:27.174
Okay. Bye.

24:30.552 --> 24:32.220
[telephone buzzes]

24:34.890 --> 24:35.807
David?

24:35.891 --> 24:38.101
Marce! Hey, sorry,
I just got your message.

24:38.185 --> 24:40.645
I was out riding,
uh, but I'd love to meet up.

24:40.729 --> 24:42.439
Um, where are you right now?

24:42.522 --> 24:43.523
I'm at home.

24:43.607 --> 24:44.608
Okay, don't leave.

24:44.691 --> 24:45.734
You coming over?

24:45.817 --> 24:47.444
No, David, uh...

24:49.154 --> 24:50.822
a dangerous flu's spreading.

24:51.907 --> 24:53.033
Like SARS?

24:53.116 --> 24:54.326
Worse than that.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.705
Wait, what, what? Where are you?

24:58.788 --> 25:00.081
I'm-- I'm-- I'm safe. Just--

25:00.165 --> 25:02.042
Why do I get worried
every time you say that?

25:02.125 --> 25:04.127
David, you don't need to worry
about me, okay?

25:04.211 --> 25:06.504
Well, I-I do, I worry about you.

25:08.089 --> 25:09.299
And I worry about my clients,

25:09.382 --> 25:12.385
most of whom don't have a home
to stay inside of.

25:12.469 --> 25:16.181
David, just stay home.
I've seen how bad this can get.

25:16.264 --> 25:18.642
Marce, I'm sorry. Thank you
for telling me, but I gotta go.

25:18.725 --> 25:19.559
David!

25:24.981 --> 25:27.943
[indistinct newscast]

25:28.610 --> 25:31.571
...Family Wellness have reported
a wide range of symptoms,

25:31.655 --> 25:35.075
from common flu ailments
like headache, fatigue, and fever,

25:35.158 --> 25:37.827
to, in rare cases, more extreme symptoms

25:37.911 --> 25:40.705
including redness
and bleeding around the eyes.

25:40.789 --> 25:45.043
At this point, health authorities
are advising the public to stay home...

25:45.126 --> 25:47.337
[music rises]

25:49.339 --> 25:51.049
-Where you headed?
-[Carly] Home.

25:51.132 --> 25:54.094
When you get there, stay there.
Seems to be a bad flu going around.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.888
-Tell everyone you know, all right?
-Sure thing.

26:04.729 --> 26:07.190
[newscaster]  Officials have been
able to determine

26:07.274 --> 26:10.068
that despite being referred to
by most as a flu,

26:10.151 --> 26:12.779
this is not actually
a new strain of influenza,

26:12.862 --> 26:15.365
but rather a new virus completely.

26:15.448 --> 26:19.411
The origins of the virus remain unknown,
and concern about the public

26:19.494 --> 26:21.913
surrounding the sickness
continues to grow.

26:21.997 --> 26:25.333
[transmission fades]

26:25.417 --> 26:27.877
[Forbes] Mac, where are you?
It's all hands over here.

26:27.961 --> 26:31.006
I know. Listen, did you receive
an antiviral in the last two weeks?

26:31.089 --> 26:32.799
Yeah, I had to save some hosts.

26:32.882 --> 26:34.217
Any of your team sick?

26:35.510 --> 26:37.095
Yeah, three of us. Why?

26:37.178 --> 26:39.889
We've seen Traveler reports this is
happening all over the world,

26:39.973 --> 26:41.933
and I think we are
the primary transmitters.

26:42.017 --> 26:42.851
[low] Shit.

26:42.934 --> 26:45.895
I have my team tracking down
the antiviral to run some tests.

26:45.979 --> 26:47.856
[Forbes]  All right,
let me know how it goes.

26:47.939 --> 26:50.191
In the meantime,
the CDC's setting up shelters.

26:50.275 --> 26:52.902
Wakefield wants us to meet up
with the National Guard.

26:52.986 --> 26:54.321
I'll text you the address.

26:54.404 --> 26:56.740
I'm on my way to the hospital.
I'll have to meet you in 30.

26:56.823 --> 26:57.657
All right.

27:02.078 --> 27:03.955
[Jenny coughing]

27:14.632 --> 27:16.426
[coughing]

27:47.290 --> 27:48.708
[pistol cocks]

27:55.256 --> 27:56.257
[Trevor] Graham.

28:01.888 --> 28:03.098
Graham, it's Trevor.

28:17.112 --> 28:18.321
I'll go check the back.

28:18.405 --> 28:19.322
[Carly] Okay.

28:30.208 --> 28:34.129
[siren blares]

28:34.212 --> 28:36.840
[distant child cries]

28:49.561 --> 28:52.188
[patients coughing]

28:52.272 --> 28:54.023
Hi, sorry,
can you tell me who's in charge?

28:54.107 --> 28:55.108
[nurse] What do you need?

28:55.191 --> 28:58.862
Well, he's got a--
a bad fever, headache.

28:58.945 --> 28:59.946
He needs to see a doctor.

29:00.029 --> 29:01.448
[nurse] He's not gonna get one here.

29:01.531 --> 29:03.700
The ER's been in overflow for an hour,

29:03.783 --> 29:05.785
and people with the flu are
being sent home.

29:05.869 --> 29:07.078
He'll be better off at home.

29:07.162 --> 29:09.414
Excuse me. Excuse me.

29:10.999 --> 29:12.625
Here's the--
he doesn't have a home.

29:12.709 --> 29:15.295
Well, he's better off anywhere but here.
You his family?

29:15.378 --> 29:16.379
Case worker.

29:16.463 --> 29:18.673
How many people are you
caring for right now?

29:18.757 --> 29:21.968
Uh... [chuckles]
officially or unofficially?

29:24.053 --> 29:24.888
Wait here.

29:30.435 --> 29:31.644
-Hi.
-Oh. Here.

29:31.728 --> 29:33.980
Um, it's not much,
but it's better than nothing.

29:34.063 --> 29:34.898
Thank you.

29:34.981 --> 29:36.608
Yeah. Be sure and keep one
for yourself.

29:36.691 --> 29:38.777
-Thank you, that's very kind.
-[nurse] Take care.

29:42.781 --> 29:43.615
Um...

29:44.991 --> 29:46.326
Agent MacLaren.

29:46.409 --> 29:47.243
David.

29:47.327 --> 29:48.536
Is-- is Marcy here?

29:48.620 --> 29:49.454
No.

29:49.537 --> 29:51.664
Uh, maybe you could pass along
a message for me?

29:51.748 --> 29:54.167
Can you ask her to come by
the shelter a little later?

29:54.250 --> 29:55.668
These guys are in rough shape.

29:55.752 --> 29:58.213
I'll pass it along, but her hands
are pretty full right now.

29:58.296 --> 29:59.380
Yeah, I bet.

29:59.464 --> 30:00.548
[man] Excuse me.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.467
Why are you taking her?
We were here first.

30:02.550 --> 30:04.761
I'm not taking anyone, sir, relax.

30:04.844 --> 30:06.471
We got a kid here!

30:06.554 --> 30:08.389
[David] How bad is it?

30:11.434 --> 30:13.061
Okay, well, I'll let you get to it, then.

30:14.646 --> 30:15.897
Remember to ask Marcy.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.941
I will. Good luck.

30:19.818 --> 30:20.819
Yeah, you too.

30:23.363 --> 30:25.198
[siren blares]

30:27.116 --> 30:29.410
[medical equipment beeping]

30:32.789 --> 30:33.873
Pupils are sluggish.

30:33.957 --> 30:35.375
Intracranial pressure?

30:35.458 --> 30:38.753
Yeah. I mean, that would explain
the headaches and the seizures.

30:38.837 --> 30:42.590
We could try mannitol
or skip straight to a cerebral shunt.

30:42.674 --> 30:45.009
Great. Isn't that your specialty?

30:45.844 --> 30:47.387
-Funny.
-[knock on door]

30:47.470 --> 30:48.721
[Philip] We got company.

30:48.805 --> 30:50.014
[Grace]  Let me in!

30:50.098 --> 30:51.516
I can't. We're sick.

30:51.599 --> 30:53.560
So am I! Let me in!

30:54.853 --> 30:56.604
[beeps]

30:58.231 --> 31:01.025
One of those teenage
petri dishes got me sick.

31:05.071 --> 31:06.990
What's all this?

31:07.073 --> 31:09.742
We got a mission to save people
who were gonna die from the flu.

31:09.826 --> 31:11.452
The Director's antiviral didn't work.

31:11.536 --> 31:12.871
That's impossible.

31:15.290 --> 31:18.418
[Philip] There's also an outbreak
in Shanghai and Berlin.

31:22.964 --> 31:24.757
[Carly, over comm]
Hey, Mac, are you there?

31:24.841 --> 31:25.675
Go ahead.

31:25.758 --> 31:28.303
We found the delivery team,
but no antiviral.

31:28.386 --> 31:31.639
The supply was cleared out,
and the team had been assassinated.

31:31.723 --> 31:32.891
What?

31:32.974 --> 31:35.768
[Carly]  There was no sign
of struggle or forced entry.

31:35.852 --> 31:37.687
Wha-- are you thinking inside job?

31:37.770 --> 31:41.482
It wouldn't be the first time
a team turned on each other, right?

31:41.566 --> 31:44.110
[low] None of this makes any sense.

31:45.111 --> 31:47.155
Okay, I'll see you back at Ops.

31:54.495 --> 31:55.371
[soft cough]

31:56.456 --> 31:57.665
She doesn't look good.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.335
[Marcy] Not helpful.

32:01.544 --> 32:02.962
Hold this above her head.

32:03.046 --> 32:05.465
None of this matters in the long run.

32:05.548 --> 32:07.383
The Director will fix it.

32:07.467 --> 32:08.676
Didn't fix him.

32:14.057 --> 32:15.391
Traveler incoming.

32:15.475 --> 32:17.101
[door lock buzzes]

32:20.271 --> 32:22.523
Ah! I told ya.
Here comes the cavalry.

32:22.607 --> 32:24.734
[Marcy] It's good to see you.
We need help.

32:24.817 --> 32:25.735
Everyone does.

32:25.818 --> 32:27.528
Let's have the cure. We can chat later.

32:27.612 --> 32:29.280
-There is no cure.
-What?

32:29.364 --> 32:30.990
Of course there is. We're from the future.

32:31.074 --> 32:34.285
Several teams are working on
a virucide, but so far without success.

32:34.369 --> 32:35.995
I'm here to talk to Philip.

32:36.079 --> 32:39.582
I want to go over the antiviral data
one more time. Maybe we made a mistake.

32:40.583 --> 32:42.377
I don't know what you're talking about.

32:43.378 --> 32:45.004
The formula you wrote on the wall.

32:45.088 --> 32:47.090
It allowed us to synthesize the antiviral.

32:48.174 --> 32:49.384
It's right here. Look.

32:53.137 --> 32:56.391
I remember this.
But I don't remember writing it down.

32:56.474 --> 32:59.060
How do you not remember?
That's impossible.

32:59.143 --> 33:00.353
When did this happen?

33:00.436 --> 33:01.980
[Traveler D13]
About two weeks ago.

33:02.063 --> 33:03.690
You were with 4514.

33:03.773 --> 33:04.607
Jenny.

33:04.691 --> 33:05.608
[Marcy] What?

33:05.692 --> 33:09.278
I had a headache and she
told me it was from the drops.

33:09.362 --> 33:11.322
She must have given you
a memory inhibitor.

33:12.657 --> 33:13.574
Oh, God.

33:13.658 --> 33:16.411
-Please tell me what is going on.
-Just go get her.

33:21.249 --> 33:24.335
-[MacLaren] Hello?
-[Kat]  Hey, it's me.

33:24.419 --> 33:25.962
What's happening? Are you all right?

33:26.587 --> 33:28.047
Grant, have you seen the news?

33:28.131 --> 33:30.341
[MacLaren]  No, I haven't.
Are you sure you're okay?

33:30.425 --> 33:33.594
Ohh... yeah, I'm just feeling
a bit... shaky.

33:33.678 --> 33:36.931
I don't know. It's probably
just the news making me crazy.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.891
Can you come home?

33:38.975 --> 33:43.104
Not-- not yet. Look, just lie down, Kat,
and stay inside, okay?

33:43.187 --> 33:45.398
Okay, what about you?
Are you gonna be all right?

33:45.481 --> 33:47.775
-[Jeff] Well, look at this.
-Grant?

33:47.859 --> 33:50.695
[sighs] I gotta go.
I just... I'll call you soon.

33:50.778 --> 33:52.321
Come to get a look at real police work?

33:52.405 --> 33:53.823
Carly's worried about your son.

33:53.906 --> 33:55.324
You need to pick him up and go home.

33:55.408 --> 33:58.077
Running errands for her now?
Thought that shit was over between you.

33:58.161 --> 33:59.912
It was never what you thought it was,

33:59.996 --> 34:02.415
and right now this is about
something bigger than that.

34:02.498 --> 34:05.877
You need to pick up your son, Jeff,
and go home.

34:12.675 --> 34:15.303
[Marcy, over comm]  Hey, it's Marcy.
We need you back at Ops.

34:15.386 --> 34:17.472
We know the source of the antiviral.

34:17.555 --> 34:20.391
Traveler named Jenny. Philip knows her.

34:20.475 --> 34:21.642
I'm on my way.

34:35.698 --> 34:37.992
-Mac, it's been over an hour.
-What are you doing here?

34:38.076 --> 34:39.744
We're late. Gotta meet the National Guard.

34:39.827 --> 34:41.245
You'll have to do it without me.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.791
-We need you.
-My team comes first.

35:01.516 --> 35:02.433
Jenny!

35:03.684 --> 35:04.519
Chloe!

35:05.520 --> 35:06.604
Jenny!

35:07.855 --> 35:08.689
Jenny!

35:08.773 --> 35:10.942
[coughing]

35:14.112 --> 35:16.322
Oh, no, no, no, no.

35:16.405 --> 35:18.825
Jenny! Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Hey.

35:20.952 --> 35:22.829
No, no, no. No, no, no.

35:22.912 --> 35:23.913
No, no.

35:30.086 --> 35:32.421
[Marcy] Are you sure about this?

35:32.505 --> 35:34.132
Do I have any other choice?

35:34.215 --> 35:37.051
[coughing weakly]

35:37.135 --> 35:38.261
[Marcy] All right.

35:38.344 --> 35:40.179
Her vitals are good.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.146
[Boyd moans and coughs]

36:11.794 --> 36:13.004
She's stable.

36:15.173 --> 36:16.007
Okay.

36:30.688 --> 36:32.565
[Jeffrey Jr. crying]

36:35.193 --> 36:36.194
[Jeff] Carly!

36:42.617 --> 36:43.951
Shit.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.453
It's okay, it's okay.

36:45.536 --> 36:48.539
[coughing] Shh, it's okay.

36:48.623 --> 36:50.958
It's okay. I got you, it's okay.

36:51.542 --> 36:53.794
It's okay. It's okay.

36:53.878 --> 36:57.089
-[coughing]
-[crying]

36:57.173 --> 36:59.175
Shh! It's okay.

36:59.258 --> 37:00.426
It's okay.

37:00.635 --> 37:01.677
It's okay.

37:02.261 --> 37:04.096
[scattered coughing]

37:17.235 --> 37:18.653
[David] You know, when I was a kid,

37:18.736 --> 37:21.530
my mom would make me chicken soup
when I was sick.

37:22.657 --> 37:25.117
Not exactly sure why it was
always chicken soup.

37:26.118 --> 37:27.119
Vera!

37:27.703 --> 37:29.038
Hey, I was trying to reach you.

37:29.121 --> 37:30.539
-I said no doctors.
-Okay, no, no.

37:30.623 --> 37:31.457
Don't touch me!

37:31.540 --> 37:33.584
No, it's-- it's David, see?

37:34.168 --> 37:35.002
Hi.

37:36.128 --> 37:36.963
-Hi.
-You okay?

37:37.046 --> 37:37.880
Yeah.

37:37.964 --> 37:39.465
-You got something to eat?
-Yeah.

37:39.548 --> 37:41.550
Okay, I'll be around
if you need me. Okay?

37:41.634 --> 37:42.468
Thank you.

37:48.724 --> 37:51.602
It's okay, big man.
We're gonna get through this.

37:51.686 --> 37:52.895
[Jeffrey Jr. crying]

37:52.979 --> 37:54.605
You're gonna be fine.

37:54.689 --> 37:57.525
You're a fighter... just like mama.

37:57.608 --> 38:00.111
-[Jeffrey Jr. crying]
-Just like Daddy.

38:00.194 --> 38:01.821
Shh. It's okay.

38:01.904 --> 38:03.030
It's okay.

38:03.114 --> 38:05.074
It's okay. It's okay.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.160
Shh.

38:08.244 --> 38:10.788
-Shh.
-[Jeffrey Jr. crying]

38:15.501 --> 38:16.627
[MacLaren] Thanks.

38:16.711 --> 38:20.089
I sense that doctor you sent me to
likes you a lot.

38:20.172 --> 38:21.757
Where is-- what's her name, Jenny?

38:21.841 --> 38:23.467
They should be back any minute.

38:23.551 --> 38:24.635
Philip knows her how?

38:26.262 --> 38:28.264
Ah. Um, so what's this?

38:29.515 --> 38:31.851
I'm trying to determine the pathogen's
reproductive number

38:31.934 --> 38:34.603
based on hospital database
social media updates.

38:35.396 --> 38:37.356
Here, let me show you something.

38:43.529 --> 38:46.073
An R-nought indicates
how infectious a virus is

38:46.157 --> 38:48.743
by determining the rate
of secondary infection.

38:48.826 --> 38:52.038
If it's less than one,
the virus will quickly die out.

38:53.956 --> 38:55.082
If it's greater than one...

38:56.542 --> 38:57.752
we have an epidemic.

38:57.835 --> 38:59.045
So, what are we dealing with?

38:59.128 --> 39:00.796
[Marcy] Let's put it into perspective.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.966
Influenza has an R-nought of one,

39:04.050 --> 39:07.386
with an incubation period of two days.

39:07.470 --> 39:10.139
Chances are, you'd infect
one person in a day,

39:10.222 --> 39:12.475
then they'd go on to infect
one more, and so on.

39:13.476 --> 39:17.104
This virus has an R-nought
of at least two

39:17.188 --> 39:21.692
with an incubation period of ten days.

39:21.776 --> 39:23.235
Fourteen days ago,

39:23.319 --> 39:27.114
ten Traveler teams across the world
transmitted the virus.

39:28.532 --> 39:30.368
So, that is...

39:35.081 --> 39:36.082
potentially...

39:36.165 --> 39:38.584
A hundred and fifty people on day one...

39:39.835 --> 39:41.545
three hundred and thirty...

39:42.838 --> 39:43.881
on day two.

39:43.964 --> 39:45.424
I don't like where this is going.

39:45.508 --> 39:50.304
[Marcy] So, based on the data I pull from
people already reporting symptoms,

39:50.388 --> 39:53.516
factoring in
the exponential growth rate...

39:54.642 --> 39:56.644
[team coughing]

39:57.561 --> 40:01.774
over four million people
are currently infected.

40:01.857 --> 40:03.484
Tomorrow, it will be almost ten.

40:03.567 --> 40:06.112
Most of them aren't showing
symptoms yet, but they will soon.

40:06.195 --> 40:08.322
So, how long before the death rate
starts to climb?

40:08.406 --> 40:09.949
[Marcy] Couple of days.

40:10.032 --> 40:11.867
[Philip] I need some help out here!

40:14.620 --> 40:16.414
[Traveler D13] Clear off that table.

40:20.167 --> 40:22.878
Marcy, I don't know if she's breathing.
She took pills.

40:24.839 --> 40:26.006
Get her up here.

40:26.090 --> 40:28.384
[Trevor coughing]

40:28.467 --> 40:30.177
[Traveler D13] I've got a weak pulse.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.720
What'd she take?

40:31.804 --> 40:32.805
Oxycodone.

40:36.517 --> 40:39.103
-Hey. Hey, Jenny, I'm here.
-[coughing]

40:39.186 --> 40:41.856
You're at Ops, you're safe.
You're safe.

40:41.939 --> 40:43.524
You overdosed.
I found you in your room.

40:43.607 --> 40:45.276
Hey, listen to me.

40:45.359 --> 40:48.028
Listen to me--
the mission is in trouble.

40:48.112 --> 40:49.989
No, Philip.

40:51.282 --> 40:53.033
The mission went exactly as planned.

40:54.326 --> 40:55.744
[MacLaren] What?

40:55.828 --> 40:56.996
What do you know?

40:57.079 --> 40:59.081
It won't change anything.

40:59.582 --> 41:00.624
What did you make me do?

41:00.708 --> 41:02.710
[panting]

41:04.670 --> 41:09.258
My team, they...
tried to record messengers.

41:09.341 --> 41:10.384
[groans]

41:10.468 --> 41:14.763
But the incoming signal
caused static on our devices.

41:15.598 --> 41:17.099
We needed an historian.

41:19.143 --> 41:21.896
And... someone to synthesize
the catalyst.

41:22.897 --> 41:24.023
No.

41:24.106 --> 41:26.525
I was directed to create an antiviral.

41:26.609 --> 41:30.905
Actually, you were directed to expedite
genetic recombination

41:30.988 --> 41:32.865
of the historical pathogen.

41:32.948 --> 41:34.533
You created the new virus.

41:34.617 --> 41:36.452
No, no, no, she's delirious.

41:36.535 --> 41:38.746
The Director would never
order that mission.

41:38.829 --> 41:41.165
Who said the mission
came from the Director?

41:43.876 --> 41:46.462
[Jenny]  The future I left is divided

41:46.545 --> 41:48.714
between those loyal to the Director

41:48.797 --> 41:50.424
and the Faction...

41:51.133 --> 41:54.970
both sides fighting for control,
back and forth.

41:57.139 --> 42:01.602
When you reset the Director,
we lost the ability to access the 21st.

42:01.685 --> 42:03.604
If we lost the past, we lost everything.

42:03.687 --> 42:06.273
So, we had no choice
but to shut down the reactor.

42:06.357 --> 42:08.150
[Carly] But we've had missions,

42:08.234 --> 42:09.235
received messengers.

42:09.318 --> 42:11.946
And it's all only messengers.

42:12.947 --> 42:15.157
Without the Director's processing power,

42:15.241 --> 42:17.493
consciousness transfer isn't possible.

42:18.202 --> 42:19.286
So...

42:20.538 --> 42:22.623
before power was cut to the Director...

42:23.207 --> 42:24.833
in our last moment of control,

42:24.917 --> 42:27.545
we sent everyone we could
to the 21st.

42:28.754 --> 42:30.214
All at once.

42:30.297 --> 42:32.049
Into the quantum frame.

42:32.132 --> 42:32.967
How many?

42:33.050 --> 42:35.594
The frame is capable
of receiving and storing thousands.

42:35.678 --> 42:38.597
So, Forbes...
all of those people with the FBI...

42:38.681 --> 42:39.682
Are all Faction.

42:39.765 --> 42:41.517
[Carly] Every mission we've done since.

42:41.600 --> 42:42.810
Has been for them.

42:42.893 --> 42:45.312
[Jenny] The Faction has our own plan.

42:45.396 --> 42:49.358
Overpopulation is the single greatest
threat to the 21st century.

42:49.441 --> 42:53.070
The Director wasn't capable
of seeing the natural solution.

42:54.280 --> 42:55.906
How many people are gonna die?

42:55.990 --> 42:59.868
The virus is genetically engineered
to preserve 70% of the population.

43:00.703 --> 43:02.329
The future will survive.

43:03.414 --> 43:05.833
And those of us who die,
including me,

43:05.916 --> 43:07.793
will have made a great sacrifice.

43:07.876 --> 43:08.877
Seventy percent?

43:08.961 --> 43:11.338
Jenny, you're murdering
over two billion people.

43:12.590 --> 43:13.799
The mission comes first.

43:16.385 --> 43:19.597
[Forbes]  Take positions
around the device and stand by.

43:23.225 --> 43:24.852
[soldier] What the hell is that?

43:32.985 --> 43:36.947
[high-pitched whir]
