00:12.447 --> 00:13.709
Jules!

00:31.292 --> 00:32.641
Jules!

00:32.728 --> 00:35.165
You can't hide from me.

00:35.296 --> 00:38.038
We need to talk this out!

00:45.610 --> 00:47.569
Jules...

01:04.238 --> 01:06.544
Jules, come out here.

01:09.591 --> 01:11.071
Don't make me come
in there and get you.

01:12.420 --> 01:13.899
Jules.

01:15.118 --> 01:18.687
I came here to start over,
to try again.

01:24.432 --> 01:25.563
You hit me.

01:25.694 --> 01:29.524
You hit me with divorce papers.

01:29.654 --> 01:31.743
That can never happen.

01:31.830 --> 01:33.658
You're scaring me, Billy.

01:33.789 --> 01:36.096
I'm scared of myself.

01:36.183 --> 01:37.184
What do you want from me?

01:37.271 --> 01:40.622
I am your husband.
You are my wife!

01:43.538 --> 01:46.062
My god, Billy, what did you do?

01:46.193 --> 01:48.934
We gotta go!
We gotta get--oh!

01:49.021 --> 01:51.414
You told me you loved me.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.765
We stood
in front of everybody.

01:53.852 --> 01:55.376
Billy, it's over.
You gotta let me--

01:55.463 --> 01:59.467
For better or for worse.
In sickness and in health.

01:59.597 --> 02:02.209
- Let me go!
- Till death do us part!

02:02.339 --> 02:05.473
Come on, Billy!

02:05.603 --> 02:08.519
Billy, come on, we have to go!

02:08.650 --> 02:11.696
Billy, the house is burning!
We gotta go now!

02:11.827 --> 02:13.655
I'm going to get help.

02:25.797 --> 02:27.712
Call 911!

02:30.802 --> 02:34.980
Jules!
Help! Help!

02:35.067 --> 02:38.070
Oh my god, Billy!

Uh-huh, now that's what

03:43.179 --> 03:44.572
I know, but I mean it this time.

03:44.659 --> 03:47.444

- Well, good morning!
- Good morning.

04:34.274 --> 04:38.365
- You're here early.
- I can come back.

04:38.495 --> 04:40.541
You can help me with
some of these easels.

04:40.671 --> 04:41.977
We're not doing our
self-portraits today?

04:42.064 --> 04:43.674
Nope, everybody
gets a clean canvas.

04:43.805 --> 04:44.806
It's free paint day.

04:44.936 --> 04:46.851
Okay.

05:06.958 --> 05:08.308
Do you mind if I take a look?

05:10.788 --> 05:12.181
Go ahead.

05:19.319 --> 05:23.105
Oh my god.
Jules, that's beautiful.

05:23.192 --> 05:25.629
And it's powerful,
the way that the yellow,

05:25.760 --> 05:29.677
it draws your eyes up from
the almost black near the base.

05:29.807 --> 05:32.201
It's shaded in deep blues.

05:32.332 --> 05:37.206
Now that I look at it,
it's kind of provocative.

05:39.339 --> 05:42.080
Cool colors tend
to fade, but here,

05:42.211 --> 05:44.518
the blue really pops.

05:44.605 --> 05:46.868
Strength where it's unexpected.

05:46.998 --> 05:49.131
Strength when it's discovered.

05:49.218 --> 05:50.611
Yeah.

05:52.134 --> 05:53.788
Thank you.

05:53.875 --> 05:55.311
Yeah.

05:59.402 --> 06:02.405
Yeah, I'd love to hear
more about your process.

06:02.536 --> 06:05.408
About you.

06:05.539 --> 06:07.758
Jules?

06:07.889 --> 06:11.414
Is it against the rules
to ask you out on a date?

06:11.545 --> 06:12.850
Mine or the class's?

06:12.937 --> 06:16.463
Yours.

06:16.550 --> 06:17.681
No.

06:17.812 --> 06:21.642
No to the date or to the rules?

06:21.729 --> 06:23.600
To the date.

06:23.687 --> 06:25.036
Ah.

06:25.123 --> 06:26.864
Why?

06:26.951 --> 06:29.345
It's complicated.

06:29.476 --> 06:31.173
I can handle complicated.

06:32.914 --> 06:34.219
I'm not ready?

06:36.570 --> 06:38.136
So you'll think about it?

06:38.267 --> 06:39.703
No, but thank you.

06:41.488 --> 06:44.273
All right, class!

06:44.360 --> 06:46.754
Welcome back to the
self-portrait class.

06:46.841 --> 06:50.279
Today we are gonna do
something a little different.

06:50.409 --> 06:53.151
You're gonna start
with a fresh canvas.

06:53.238 --> 06:57.068
And I want you to dig
deep down inside and...

06:57.155 --> 06:59.201
and paint how you feel.

06:59.288 --> 07:01.029
Let me see it.

07:03.248 --> 07:05.729
Let me see your colors
in all your hues.

07:07.905 --> 07:10.299
What has gotten into
that Inge today?

07:10.386 --> 07:12.257
She think we're all
Olympians or something?

07:12.344 --> 07:13.998
Well, you are in
the baddest shape

07:14.129 --> 07:15.565
of anyone in that class.

07:15.696 --> 07:17.437
I'm not badder than Inge.

07:17.524 --> 07:18.873
That Norse bitch!

07:20.004 --> 07:21.876
Well, my ass thanks her.

07:21.963 --> 07:23.181
Ah, yes.

07:25.270 --> 07:26.620
So?

07:26.707 --> 07:28.578
What's the tea
with the hot engineer?

07:28.665 --> 07:29.797
Paul?

07:29.884 --> 07:32.582
Please, of course Paul.

07:32.669 --> 07:34.105
Did he push for the date yet?

07:34.192 --> 07:36.543
Yes.

07:36.673 --> 07:39.589
And you said yes.

07:39.676 --> 07:41.504
I woke up in a panic last night.

07:41.591 --> 07:45.116
I could actually feel
Billy's hands around my neck.

07:45.203 --> 07:47.205
Maybe you shouldn't
be back at the house.

07:47.336 --> 07:48.903
You know, the upstairs
is not done yet.

07:49.033 --> 07:50.731
And with all the people
coming and going--

07:50.818 --> 07:54.038
I know.
I know, but I'm--

07:54.169 --> 07:56.737
I'm actually enjoying
it, you know?

07:56.824 --> 07:58.782
I get to pick out
all the colors.

07:58.913 --> 08:01.655
The designs are mine alone.

08:01.785 --> 08:04.179
It's like everything
he tore down,

08:04.309 --> 08:08.357
I get to rebuild,
like a rebirth.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.752
Just not with the house--
with me too, you know?

08:11.839 --> 08:14.929
Remember what you told me
that first night?

08:15.059 --> 08:16.626
I will not live in fear.

08:16.713 --> 08:19.063
Damn straight.

08:19.194 --> 08:20.978
Going back to school.

08:21.109 --> 08:22.980
Opening your studio.

08:23.067 --> 08:25.722
Building your
business every day.

08:25.853 --> 08:28.856
Everybody wants
a peek at the freak!

08:28.943 --> 08:32.207
The people in this town,
they all think I killed Billy.

08:32.337 --> 08:34.948
- Jules...
- What, you didn't know?

08:35.078 --> 08:37.299
I'm the Lethal Lover.

08:37.429 --> 08:39.649
The Hardcore Husband Killer.

08:39.780 --> 08:41.999
Stop, okay? Stop.

08:42.130 --> 08:47.744
You are the strongest,
most courageous woman I know.

08:47.875 --> 08:49.529
I'm not.

08:49.616 --> 08:51.705
But I appreciate the praise.

08:51.792 --> 08:53.837
That's what friends are for.

08:53.924 --> 08:55.839
And as far as I can see,

08:55.926 --> 08:58.755
just another reason to get
up on that yummy engineer

08:58.842 --> 09:01.018
so he can get down on you.

09:01.105 --> 09:05.153
Uh, I don't need another
reason to date Paul.

09:05.240 --> 09:08.635
Oh, hello, okay!

09:08.765 --> 09:10.985
Did he spill paint and have
to take his shirt off again?

09:11.072 --> 09:13.378
Mm...

09:13.465 --> 09:15.729
Okay, I need the deets.

09:15.859 --> 09:18.470
Uh-huh, I will give
them to you later.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.561
But I gotta go get
cleaned up so I can see Ron.

09:21.691 --> 09:24.564
I thought you saw
Dr. Ron on Thursdays.

09:24.651 --> 09:27.044
Yeah, I'm back at
twice a week again.

09:27.131 --> 09:29.699
Can't squeeze all
my crazy into one session.

09:31.309 --> 09:34.008
I can't rush my recovery.

09:34.095 --> 09:36.445
I need...time.

09:37.272 --> 09:39.535
Whoo!

09:39.665 --> 09:41.581
It's colder than death in here!

09:43.104 --> 09:44.758
Kenny?

09:45.628 --> 09:46.977
Yeah?

09:47.108 --> 09:49.545
Uh, I had this set
at 75 during the day.

09:49.676 --> 09:50.938
I didn't change it.

09:51.025 --> 09:53.114
It's now at 50.

09:53.201 --> 09:55.333
Right, let me look at it.

09:57.292 --> 09:58.859
System seems to be okay.

09:58.946 --> 10:00.295
You know, one of the workers
probably messed with it.

10:00.425 --> 10:02.950
- I'll ask them, okay?
- Okay. Thanks.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.692
Oh, your back deck's
almost done.

10:05.822 --> 10:07.563
It's gonna be beautiful.
You open up those doors,

10:07.694 --> 10:10.305
it's gonna feel like your
entire living room is outside.

10:10.435 --> 10:12.046
You gettin' me
through this, Kenny.

10:12.133 --> 10:13.787
You gettin' me through!

10:13.917 --> 10:16.006
- Thank you!
- You bet.

10:25.146 --> 10:28.584
And when I saw
the thermostat set low,

10:28.671 --> 10:30.455
I froze.

10:30.542 --> 10:32.414
Even years from now, something
could happen to trigger you.

10:32.501 --> 10:35.112
Your first thought
will be Billy.

10:35.199 --> 10:36.287
That's what long-term
trauma does.

10:36.374 --> 10:40.117
It actually changes the brain.

10:40.204 --> 10:42.337
He liked it cold.

10:42.467 --> 10:45.079
I mean, really cold.

10:45.209 --> 10:49.344
We used to fight about it,
control over the thermostat.

10:50.998 --> 10:55.045
Dana used to say, "Cold hands,
cold heart, close to death."

10:55.132 --> 10:56.481
Hm.

10:56.568 --> 10:59.441
You know, b-before
he actually died.

10:59.528 --> 11:01.225
You won't always be so scared.

11:01.356 --> 11:04.359
The brain is wired
for survival, though.

11:04.489 --> 11:06.709
Takes time to learn
new responses.

11:06.796 --> 11:09.103
Give it time.

11:09.190 --> 11:12.193
When we can calm
our fear response,

11:12.323 --> 11:14.630
we can see things clearly.

11:14.761 --> 11:17.981
Make a rational decision instead
of one based off of fear.

11:18.068 --> 11:19.200
Yeah, exactly.

11:19.287 --> 11:21.550
How long did it take
you to calm down?

11:21.681 --> 11:23.552
Well, it felt like
it was forever,

11:23.639 --> 11:26.337
but I guess about
a minute or two.

11:26.424 --> 11:27.512
And how long would
it have taken you

11:27.599 --> 11:29.645
just a couple of months ago?

11:29.776 --> 11:33.388
Uh-huh, Dana would've
had to come over

11:33.475 --> 11:36.217
and check under every bed,

11:36.304 --> 11:39.176
then have some wine with me,
probably spend the night.

11:39.263 --> 11:42.353
You're not the woman you were.

11:42.440 --> 11:45.356
That's true.
Thanks to you.

11:45.487 --> 11:46.967
Oh, you get all
the credit for that,

11:47.054 --> 11:49.796
and your classes.
You have a gift for this.

11:49.926 --> 11:53.843
Helping people,
it comes naturally to you.

11:53.930 --> 11:58.195
You know, in the
short time I taught,

11:58.282 --> 12:03.244
I've seen the emotion
that I can pull from people.

12:03.331 --> 12:05.594
I'm putting a show together.

12:05.681 --> 12:07.465
Of your work?
That's wonderful.

12:07.596 --> 12:09.076
Not just of mine.

12:09.163 --> 12:13.428
Um, some of my students
from my self-portrait class.

12:13.515 --> 12:16.910
I could see them staring
at themselves on canvas,

12:17.040 --> 12:20.000
finding healing and direction.

12:20.130 --> 12:22.524
Jules the art therapist.

12:22.654 --> 12:24.744
Jules the art teacher, now.

12:24.874 --> 12:29.009
Hey, you're an artist
no matter what.

12:29.096 --> 12:33.361
Nuh-oh, I know that look.

12:33.491 --> 12:36.494
You wanna cut our session
short so you can go paint.

12:36.625 --> 12:39.410
No, that's not...

12:39.497 --> 12:41.935
I mean...

12:42.065 --> 12:44.938
I wanna capture this feeling,

12:45.025 --> 12:48.419
but I don't even
know what to call it.

12:48.506 --> 12:50.944
It's called fulfillment, Jules.
Nobody deserves it more.

13:10.441 --> 13:12.095
Jules Moss?

13:12.226 --> 13:14.315
Jules Baker.
Moss was my married name.

13:14.402 --> 13:16.186
I'm Detective Walker.
This is Detective Young.

13:16.273 --> 13:18.101
We're sorry to bother you.

13:18.188 --> 13:20.103
We just have a few questions.

13:20.234 --> 13:22.236
- Can we come inside?
- Now?

13:22.366 --> 13:25.195
My house is being renovated.
It's not a good time.

13:25.326 --> 13:26.544
We don't mind.
It'll only be a few moments.

13:26.675 --> 13:28.329
Yeah.

13:28.459 --> 13:31.506
Okay, I guess you gonna
do what you wanna do.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.946
I--I don't understand.
Why are you here, Detective?

13:37.077 --> 13:38.992
We need to talk about June 5th.

13:39.122 --> 13:41.472
- The night of the fire.
- Yeah, I remember that night.

13:41.603 --> 13:44.432
It's kind of burned in my head.

13:44.519 --> 13:46.738
Well, we just need to go over
the details one more time.

13:46.869 --> 13:49.002
Oh, from when my husband
tried to murder me?

13:49.089 --> 13:50.568
No, no, no, no.

13:50.699 --> 13:52.701
See, I've worked very hard
to move past that night.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.790
I don't see why you
can't do the same.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.270
We have new evidence suggesting

13:56.357 --> 13:58.489
that your house fire
wasn't an accident.

13:58.620 --> 13:59.969
The gas line was tampered with.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.754
And given your relationship
with the deceased,

14:02.885 --> 14:07.890
- you are a person of interest.
- I'm sorry.

14:08.021 --> 14:11.198
You--you think
I torched my own home?

14:11.285 --> 14:12.677
Now, why would I do that?

14:12.764 --> 14:14.418
Well, why don't you tell us?

14:14.549 --> 14:17.291
You left your husband
in that house.

14:17.421 --> 14:19.597
He died in that fire, Ms. Baker.

14:19.684 --> 14:22.644
He tried to kill me in
that fire, Detective Walker!

14:22.774 --> 14:24.907
But the fire is now suspicious,

14:25.038 --> 14:26.430
and given your
complicated history--

14:26.561 --> 14:29.564
It's not complicated.

14:29.651 --> 14:31.522
He made my life hell.
I reported it.

14:31.609 --> 14:33.089
I couldn't get a
restraining order

14:33.176 --> 14:38.181
because they told me you
can't press charges for words.

14:38.268 --> 14:40.749
Hm.

14:40.880 --> 14:45.145
You stand to gain a lot
of money from his death.

14:45.232 --> 14:46.842
Yeah?

14:46.929 --> 14:48.975
It seems like enough reason to--

14:49.105 --> 14:51.325
Off my husband?

14:51.412 --> 14:53.893
You want motive?
How about alimony?

14:53.980 --> 14:56.112
Billy Moss made a lot of money.

14:56.199 --> 14:58.636
I had every reason to keep him
alive for a long, long time--

14:58.767 --> 15:01.422
away from me, but alive.

15:01.552 --> 15:04.686
Well, you've been
spending a lot of money,

15:04.773 --> 15:06.079
rebuilding the house.

15:06.209 --> 15:11.040
And after such
a short grieving process,

15:11.171 --> 15:13.390
you started a new relationship.

15:13.477 --> 15:17.046
Oh, I'm sorry.
It is new, isn't it?

15:17.133 --> 15:19.440
Are you following me?

15:19.527 --> 15:21.877
We have been keeping an
eye on you here at the house

15:22.008 --> 15:23.792
and at the gallery.

15:23.879 --> 15:26.229
I knew I saw
someone at the gallery.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.623
Jesus Christ, you people!

15:28.710 --> 15:30.190
Here's how it's
gonna go, Ms. Baker.

15:30.277 --> 15:32.453
Jules?

15:32.583 --> 15:34.585
Oh my god, don't shoot.
I'm just the neighbor.

15:34.716 --> 15:36.370
Naomi, what are you doing here?

15:36.500 --> 15:38.763
- Uh...
- I'm sorry.

15:38.894 --> 15:40.983
I saw the squad car out front,

15:41.070 --> 15:42.680
so I wanted to make
sure you were okay.

15:42.767 --> 15:44.944
I'm fine.

15:45.031 --> 15:48.599
But when an officer
pulls a gun in my house,

15:48.730 --> 15:51.951
it's time for you to leave.

15:52.081 --> 15:54.518
You are done here--
right, Officers?

15:54.605 --> 15:56.694
Detectives.

15:56.781 --> 16:00.524
And yes, thank you.

16:00.611 --> 16:04.354
Oh, one more thing.

16:04.441 --> 16:08.097
Given the circumstances,
the insurance companies

16:08.228 --> 16:10.447
are more than happy to wait

16:10.578 --> 16:13.798
until we've finished our
investigation before paying out.

16:13.929 --> 16:15.496
Good luck on your renovation.

16:19.021 --> 16:20.718
And if you think of
anything that might help

16:20.849 --> 16:26.115
with our investigation,
please feel free to call.

16:26.202 --> 16:28.639
And I'm sorry.

16:38.214 --> 16:40.042
I can't believe this!

16:40.129 --> 16:41.391
That was crazy!
Are you okay?

16:41.522 --> 16:42.827
Yeah--no--

16:42.914 --> 16:44.046
God, god, I don't know.

16:44.177 --> 16:46.570
I thought I had put
all this behind me.

16:46.657 --> 16:48.398
And now they think
I killed Billy?

16:48.485 --> 16:50.618
That's crazy!

16:50.705 --> 16:52.620
It's not surprising,
the way that people talk.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.796
And they've been watching
me at the gallery.

16:54.926 --> 16:57.320
They think I've started up
a new relationship.

16:57.451 --> 16:58.713
You started a new relationship?

16:58.843 --> 17:00.193
No.

17:00.323 --> 17:01.890
But I can if I want to.
It's my life.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.848
Billy doesn't
control it anymore.

17:03.935 --> 17:07.156
- Right.
- God.

17:07.242 --> 17:08.896
Think I can get one of those?

17:08.983 --> 17:10.594
Yeah, I'm sorry.

17:10.681 --> 17:11.900
Thank you.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.424
I'm sorry about
that bottle, too.

17:14.555 --> 17:16.644
Ah, don't worry about it.
We can clean it up later.

17:16.731 --> 17:18.559
Okay.

17:18.646 --> 17:19.951
Thanks for coming over.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.127
You know me.

17:21.257 --> 17:23.215
Butting in is kind of my jam.

17:23.346 --> 17:26.393
Man, I am so grateful
I have Ron.

17:26.522 --> 17:28.612
- Is that the new guy?
- What? No.

17:28.743 --> 17:31.485
There--there's no guy.
Ron is my therapist.

17:31.615 --> 17:34.488
He's been keeping me
sane ever since Billy.

17:34.575 --> 17:37.360
I don't know how I'd
survive without him.

17:37.491 --> 17:41.190
Promise me you'll call me
if you need anything, okay?

17:41.277 --> 17:42.583
Okay.

17:42.713 --> 17:44.237
I'm serious,
like, anything at all.

17:44.367 --> 17:47.066
You know I'm all about us being
friends, not just neighbors.

17:47.153 --> 17:49.285
Well, thank you,
I appreciate it.

18:09.740 --> 18:11.220
Cheers!

18:27.410 --> 18:29.412
Shhhhhh...

18:54.785 --> 18:56.091
You look beautiful.

18:56.222 --> 18:58.267
Thank you.
So do you.

18:58.398 --> 19:00.008
- You ready?
- Yeah.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.232
I'm looking forward
to this date.

19:10.975 --> 19:14.065
The police came to your house?
Why?

19:14.153 --> 19:15.719
They think that I...

19:15.850 --> 19:17.547
Oh, forget it.

19:17.634 --> 19:19.549
No, don't do that.

19:19.636 --> 19:21.725
For real, tell me.

19:21.856 --> 19:24.206
Well, didn't you hear?
I'm a killer date.

19:24.337 --> 19:25.990
Oh.

19:26.077 --> 19:29.385
And bringing a killer on
the first date to a taco truck,

19:29.516 --> 19:31.692
that's a bit risky.

19:31.779 --> 19:33.650
But it's a slam dunk for
me, so you get to live.

19:35.870 --> 19:37.698
Oh, I see, you like Mexican.

19:37.828 --> 19:39.874
I love Mexican.
Billy hated it

19:40.004 --> 19:42.181
and I was never
allowed to eat tacos,

19:42.268 --> 19:44.574
and now all I wanna do
is eat tacos.

19:44.705 --> 19:46.576
Never allowed?

19:46.663 --> 19:48.752
Jeez.

19:48.839 --> 19:50.667
I guess some people
are like that.

19:50.754 --> 19:52.060
They can't stand to
see anyone happy.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.845
They always gotta
find a way to ruin it.

19:54.932 --> 19:56.934
Nah, he wasn't always like that.

19:57.021 --> 19:59.807
But man, towards the end?

19:59.894 --> 20:01.678
That must've been hard
for you to live with.

20:01.809 --> 20:05.334
You're the exact opposite.

20:05.421 --> 20:06.857
What do you mean?

20:09.686 --> 20:12.385
Uh, I studied you
a bit in class.

20:12.472 --> 20:13.734
Mm-hmm!

20:15.518 --> 20:18.260
Oh!

20:18.347 --> 20:21.307
Last week,
you seemed a bit down.

20:21.394 --> 20:24.701
But when Louisa was so excited
to paint light and shadows,

20:24.788 --> 20:26.573
you glowed.

20:26.660 --> 20:27.704
You had this inner joy.

20:27.835 --> 20:31.752
You...you magnified it.

20:31.882 --> 20:33.275
Well, she killed it.

20:33.406 --> 20:34.537
Yeah.

20:34.624 --> 20:37.540
I mean, painting
light is very hard.

20:37.671 --> 20:38.715
Will you tell it?

20:43.024 --> 20:45.679
Should we order some more?

20:45.766 --> 20:51.032
I mean, it being my first date,
I'm supposed to eat like a lady.

20:51.162 --> 20:54.775
But can we get four more
carne asadas, extra jalapeños?

20:56.429 --> 20:57.560
Wanna feel the burn!

20:57.691 --> 21:01.564
Okay!
I think they got you.

21:02.957 --> 21:04.654
- I have a question.
- Mm-hmm?

21:04.785 --> 21:06.917
Have you ever taken
martial arts classes?

21:07.004 --> 21:09.224
Really!

21:09.311 --> 21:12.445
Oh, I can teach you a few moves.

21:12.575 --> 21:13.968
Oh?

21:15.839 --> 21:17.319
Wait, wait, no, wait.

21:18.973 --> 21:20.279
Defensive moves.

21:20.366 --> 21:22.498
Uh-huh.

21:22.585 --> 21:25.153
I've been training
since I was nine years old.

21:25.240 --> 21:28.025
I was--I was like the
little Black karate kid.

21:28.112 --> 21:29.592
- Wah!
- Watch out.

21:29.679 --> 21:31.377
Oh, yup, oh, oh!

21:32.508 --> 21:33.596
If I had some
chopsticks, I would--

21:33.683 --> 21:36.860
I would catch a fly right now.

21:36.991 --> 21:39.341
No, and you know,
I still--I still train.

21:39.428 --> 21:42.866
I help out at the
dojo on 7th and Main.

21:42.953 --> 21:44.564
- Karate engineer.
- Mm-hmm.

21:44.694 --> 21:46.000
I'd love to see that.

21:47.828 --> 21:51.266
Really? Anytime.

21:51.353 --> 21:54.182
They do a--they do
a class Saturday mornings.

21:54.269 --> 21:55.575
They teach self-defense.

21:55.662 --> 21:59.405
And then after that, the--
You know what?

21:59.535 --> 22:01.711
You should come to see the kids.

22:01.798 --> 22:02.973
Have to see the kids.

22:03.060 --> 22:05.106
They're so inspiring to watch.

22:05.236 --> 22:06.847
You can actually
see their growth

22:06.934 --> 22:08.718
from one class to the next.

22:08.849 --> 22:10.198
Billy!

22:15.334 --> 22:17.379
What?

22:17.466 --> 22:21.296
Uh, I thought I saw my
husband, dead husband.

22:21.383 --> 22:23.167
Where?

22:23.298 --> 22:26.997
Over there by those trees?

22:27.128 --> 22:30.784
But I--I know I didn't see him
'cause he's not alive.

22:30.871 --> 22:33.395
My god, what is wrong with me?

22:33.482 --> 22:36.355
Jules, look at me.

22:36.442 --> 22:39.227
Nothing is wrong with you.

22:39.314 --> 22:41.664
I wouldn't be so sure.

22:41.751 --> 22:45.233
Every day I'm glad
that bastard's dead.

22:45.320 --> 22:47.235
I know that's a
terrible thing to say.

22:49.933 --> 22:51.370
You wanna talk about it?

22:53.676 --> 22:57.071
I do, but...another night.

23:00.553 --> 23:05.732
Well, here's to another night.

23:25.708 --> 23:28.058
- So you're okay?
- I am, I am.

23:29.538 --> 23:33.237
Hey, I...thought I
left that light on.

23:33.324 --> 23:35.588
You sure?

23:35.675 --> 23:37.285
Y-yeah.

23:37.416 --> 23:38.852
Never mind.

23:38.939 --> 23:40.723
I can go in there and
check it out for you.

23:40.810 --> 23:44.031
No, it's--it's probably nothing.

23:44.118 --> 23:47.251
Okay, well, I had fun tonight.

23:47.338 --> 23:48.601
Me too.

23:50.777 --> 23:51.995
Wait, what was that?

23:52.126 --> 23:53.562
What was that?

23:53.649 --> 23:55.651
Abby?

23:56.783 --> 23:58.437
Abby?

24:00.656 --> 24:02.266
Oh, hi, I'm sorry, I didn't--

24:02.353 --> 24:04.138
I didn't mean to
interrupt anything.

24:04.225 --> 24:06.270
No, no, it's okay.

24:06.357 --> 24:09.839
I'm, um, looking for Abby?

24:09.970 --> 24:12.494
- Abby?
- My cat.

24:12.581 --> 24:14.670
Well, we just got home.
I haven't seen her.

24:14.801 --> 24:16.280
Okay.

24:19.588 --> 24:20.894
Who's this?

24:20.981 --> 24:25.942
- This is Paul.
- Paul, Naomi.

24:26.029 --> 24:30.207
- It's nice to meet you, Paul.
- Nice to meet you as well.

24:30.294 --> 24:32.427
You know, I'll just--I'll
just get out of your way.

24:32.514 --> 24:35.169
- Didn't mean--sorry.
- No, no, it's okay.

24:35.256 --> 24:38.215
Um, good night, Paul.

24:38.346 --> 24:40.653
- I'll call you tomorrow?
- Please.

24:44.787 --> 24:46.572
- It's nice meeting you.
- Nice to meet you too.

24:55.058 --> 24:57.887
Did I just interrupt some
pre-smashing of some sort?

24:58.018 --> 25:00.629
No, no, no, no, no.

25:00.716 --> 25:02.936
Okay, well, that's
the guy, right?

25:03.066 --> 25:05.765
Yeah, that's the guy.

25:05.852 --> 25:08.332
I'll let you know if
I see Abby in the backyard.

25:08.419 --> 25:09.899
Thank you. I appreciate it.

25:10.030 --> 25:11.248
Welcome.

25:11.379 --> 25:12.598
Night.

25:18.386 --> 25:19.692
What the hell?

25:23.696 --> 25:26.263
How is it set to 75?

25:57.599 --> 25:58.731
Jules?

25:58.818 --> 26:00.123
It's just me,
it's just me, just me.

26:00.254 --> 26:01.821
What are you doing here?

26:01.908 --> 26:03.997
I got a notification on my
phone about your thermostat.

26:04.127 --> 26:05.476
I came to fix it.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.043
I just--I thought it
might override the system.

26:07.130 --> 26:08.654
Seriously, you just
let yourself in?

26:08.741 --> 26:10.133
No, no, I--I
knocked on the door.

26:10.264 --> 26:11.570
I rang the bell.

26:11.657 --> 26:13.006
I thought I was
gonna be in and out.

26:13.093 --> 26:14.834
I forgot my toolbox.

26:16.792 --> 26:19.578
- See?
- Yeah.

26:19.665 --> 26:21.536
Well, I guess
I'll see you tomorrow.

26:21.623 --> 26:24.147
- We're good?
- Yeah, we're good.

26:24.278 --> 26:25.453
Okay.

26:36.769 --> 26:39.032
When was the
last time you slept?

26:39.119 --> 26:41.687
I didn't last night.

26:41.817 --> 26:45.473
The thermostat, the seeing
something in the park, I get.

26:45.560 --> 26:49.042
But that picture?
Who put that there?

26:49.172 --> 26:51.305
Maybe one of the
construction guys found it.

26:51.392 --> 26:52.785
Didn't know whether
to throw it out or not.

26:55.483 --> 26:57.267
Consider sitting down, Jules.

26:59.835 --> 27:01.141
Okay.

27:03.839 --> 27:05.493
Okay.

27:07.582 --> 27:10.890
I think I saw my dead husband,
who the cops think I murdered,

27:11.020 --> 27:12.456
so there's that.

27:12.543 --> 27:14.502
I get it.
There's a lot going on.

27:14.589 --> 27:16.286
But you know how
to calm yourself.

27:16.373 --> 27:18.811
You have learned the techniques.

27:18.898 --> 27:20.247
Remember what we practiced?

27:21.465 --> 27:23.772
Yeah.

27:23.859 --> 27:27.297
Close my eyes,
take three breaths in,

27:27.384 --> 27:30.300
take three breaths out,
open my eyes.

27:30.387 --> 27:32.999
It's like a mini reset.
So go ahead.

27:57.763 --> 28:00.330
Man, that really works.

28:00.417 --> 28:02.506
Well, you might need to take
a few more of them breaths

28:02.593 --> 28:04.508
before I hit you with this.

28:04.595 --> 28:06.119
What now?

28:06.206 --> 28:08.034
The insurance company.

28:08.164 --> 28:10.297
They're stopping payment
on Billy's policy

28:10.427 --> 28:14.214
and the home policy
pending police investigation.

28:14.301 --> 28:15.911
That sucks.

28:15.998 --> 28:18.958
Totally, but I figured
a way to run the numbers.

28:19.045 --> 28:21.612
You can keep the work
going on the house.

28:21.743 --> 28:24.572
Just one request.

28:24.659 --> 28:28.358
- Paul.
- Oh?

28:28.489 --> 28:32.623
Forget all this nonsense and
keep that second date with him.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.800
He makes you smile.

28:34.930 --> 28:36.497
It's a good look on you.

28:45.114 --> 28:48.248

28:48.378 --> 28:51.077

Come on.

29:41.431 --> 29:43.782
Okay.

29:43.869 --> 29:45.653
Oh.

Five minutes late.
There was traffic and I'm so--

30:27.738 --> 30:29.871
Is Ron in his of--

30:29.958 --> 30:32.961
Helen, what's wrong?

30:33.092 --> 30:36.138
Ron was in an accident!

30:36.269 --> 30:38.010
Oh my god!

30:38.097 --> 30:43.232
He's in the hospital,
on life support.

30:43.319 --> 30:45.104
What happened?

30:45.234 --> 30:47.410
He was just out jogging.

30:47.541 --> 30:49.630
And he got hit by a car.

30:53.329 --> 30:56.245
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Listen, I don't know.

30:56.376 --> 30:58.639
I don't know,
I don't have time for this.

30:58.769 --> 31:00.771
I just have to still
make all these calls,

31:00.859 --> 31:03.165
and I have to let
his patients know.

31:04.079 --> 31:05.951
Okay, I'm sorry.

31:07.474 --> 31:09.519
I'm sorry.

31:16.657 --> 31:18.050
Ms. Baker.

31:18.137 --> 31:20.139
What, you following me
again, Detective Walker?

31:20.226 --> 31:21.357
No, absolutely not.

31:21.444 --> 31:23.098
I'm here investigating
an accident.

31:23.185 --> 31:24.752
Ron Winslow?

31:24.883 --> 31:27.537
- How do you know?
- He's my therapist.

31:27.624 --> 31:28.582
I had an appointment
with him today.

31:28.712 --> 31:31.498
Is he okay?

31:31.585 --> 31:33.369
It's not good.

31:33.456 --> 31:36.242
He didn't make it.
Hit-and-run.

31:36.329 --> 31:39.680
Witness says they saw
a car speeding off, but...

31:39.767 --> 31:41.203
that's all we got.

31:41.334 --> 31:43.902
We will find who did this.

31:43.989 --> 31:45.555
Count on it.

31:47.470 --> 31:48.907
Excuse me.

31:48.994 --> 31:50.691
Oh, um...

31:52.519 --> 31:54.347
Can I ask you a question?

31:54.434 --> 31:56.175
Yeah.

31:56.262 --> 31:58.394
Where were you this morning?

32:07.403 --> 32:10.276
I'm so sorry.

32:10.363 --> 32:13.105
Man, I only got this far
because of you and Ron,

32:13.235 --> 32:16.282
and now...

32:16.369 --> 32:18.501
It's okay.

32:18.632 --> 32:20.503
His memory will always
be a blessing to you

32:20.590 --> 32:22.984
and you're not alone.

32:23.071 --> 32:24.551
You got God, and I'm here.

32:24.638 --> 32:27.293
And we aren't going anywhere.

32:27.380 --> 32:28.772
Thank you.

32:31.340 --> 32:33.125
I know it's a lot,

32:33.212 --> 32:35.605
but the best way for
you to honor his memory

32:35.692 --> 32:38.043
is by remembering his advice.

32:38.173 --> 32:40.393
He always said you were
stronger than you know.

33:07.594 --> 33:09.857
This didn't
look like this yesterday.

33:09.944 --> 33:11.119
Yeah.

33:11.206 --> 33:12.991
The bright yellow
in my life is gone.

33:14.862 --> 33:17.299
Listen, um, I'm sorry.

33:17.430 --> 33:20.346
Maybe you've signed up for
some lightweight kind of crazy,

33:20.476 --> 33:22.565
but...

33:22.696 --> 33:28.223
that's cute, and maybe
a little exciting.

33:28.310 --> 33:31.531
I can handle
a little crazy, Jules.

33:31.618 --> 33:34.490
No, you don't want this
kind of crazy coming at ya.

33:34.577 --> 33:38.538
I'm talking like
5150 lock-her-up crazy.

33:38.668 --> 33:43.630
I just don't think
I can handle this right now.

33:46.763 --> 33:49.070
If you don't want
to see me, I get it.

33:49.201 --> 33:51.942
Okay? But...

33:52.073 --> 33:54.554
Maybe I can help you.

33:54.684 --> 33:57.122
As friends.

33:57.209 --> 33:59.994
- How?
- By teaching you.

34:00.125 --> 34:02.127
Making sure that you never
have to fear anyone else again.

34:03.737 --> 34:07.741
Now, I don't know if
it works on ghosts...

34:07.828 --> 34:09.177
I'm sorry.

34:09.308 --> 34:10.918
But we can give it a try.

34:13.703 --> 34:16.010
Okay.

34:22.712 --> 34:24.540
Okay, I'm ready.

34:27.413 --> 34:28.762
Nice.

34:32.244 --> 34:34.420
Good, right.

34:34.507 --> 34:35.768
Good, good.

34:37.031 --> 34:41.382
Nice look.

34:41.469 --> 34:42.732
Yeah, I guess
I forgot to tell you

34:42.819 --> 34:44.734
I'm a crash test dummy.

34:44.821 --> 34:47.302
I'm the assailant that
the women usually come after.

34:47.389 --> 34:48.869
- Ah.
- Mm-hmm.

34:48.956 --> 34:51.176
Jules, Miranda.
Miranda, Jules.

34:51.263 --> 34:53.091
She is our fearless leader.

34:53.178 --> 34:54.831
- Very nice to meet you.
- You too.

34:54.918 --> 34:59.445
Make sure you watch out for her.
She kicks ass--mostly mine.

34:59.532 --> 35:01.186
All right, so there's
three self-defense moves

35:01.273 --> 35:03.013
that every woman should know.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.929
The first is
the open hand strike.

35:07.192 --> 35:09.455
Hah!

35:09.542 --> 35:11.631
Second is kick to the groin.

35:12.501 --> 35:14.024
Yah!

35:14.155 --> 35:16.114
Or a knee to the groin,
if you're close enough.

35:16.201 --> 35:18.594
Hah!

35:18.725 --> 35:20.857
I know,
it's a lot, I know.

35:20.988 --> 35:23.382
You're in good hands, all right?
We got you.

35:23.469 --> 35:24.948
Miranda, let's put 'em
all together for her.

35:25.035 --> 35:26.385
Got it.

35:31.651 --> 35:32.956
Okay, plan B.

35:33.043 --> 35:35.437
Uh, maybe I should
just get a gun.

35:35.568 --> 35:38.571
Um, gun is not usually
the best answer.

35:38.658 --> 35:42.314
Are you prepared
to shoot somebody?

35:42.401 --> 35:43.793
Oh, no.

35:43.880 --> 35:47.014
Mm, just that
hesitation right there.

35:47.101 --> 35:50.496
Just one quick move.

35:50.626 --> 35:53.542
Your opponent has disarmed you
and now they have your weapon.

35:53.629 --> 35:57.894
Never point a gun unless
you're prepared to shoot.

35:57.981 --> 35:59.983
Okay.

36:00.070 --> 36:01.202
Teach me.

36:01.289 --> 36:03.813
Let's do it.

36:03.900 --> 36:07.077
Okay, so it's two objectives.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.732
One, you always wanna get free.

36:09.863 --> 36:11.952
Two, run away.

36:12.082 --> 36:13.475
First thing I'mma do
is I'm gonna teach you

36:13.562 --> 36:15.390
how to throw a
knee into my groin.

36:15.477 --> 36:17.305
Oh, god, okay.

36:17.392 --> 36:19.786
All right, what you wanna do is
you wanna take your--your hand,

36:19.873 --> 36:22.310
put it on my shoulder, and
then you're gonna hold my wrist.

36:22.397 --> 36:25.400
- Okay.
- Drive your knee into my groin.

36:25.487 --> 36:26.662
All right, let's try.

36:28.316 --> 36:30.362
- You're fine, go ahead.
- Okay.

36:30.492 --> 36:32.451
Mm!

36:32.538 --> 36:33.582
Harder.

36:34.975 --> 36:36.411
- I don't wanna hurt you!
- Jules, go!

36:36.498 --> 36:37.891
- I'm doing it!
- Harder!

36:37.978 --> 36:39.240
All right, all right.

36:39.371 --> 36:40.981
This ain't the kids' class.

36:41.111 --> 36:43.897
Okay, okay, okay.

36:43.984 --> 36:46.204
- Come on, do it hard.
- That was hard!

36:46.291 --> 36:48.771
No, it was--do it hard!
I got this gear on, you're good.

36:48.858 --> 36:51.252
- All right, okay.
- Let's go.

36:51.339 --> 36:52.775
Don't grab my wrist--

36:55.300 --> 36:57.519
Oh my god, I am so sorry.

36:57.650 --> 37:02.220
No, um...that
was--that was better.

37:02.350 --> 37:03.699
Oh my god.

37:37.603 --> 37:39.169
Billy.

37:39.300 --> 37:40.606
Are you okay?

37:43.957 --> 37:46.351
Stick with me.

37:46.481 --> 37:48.135
No...

37:48.222 --> 37:50.703
I want you to see with
your mind and your eyes,

37:50.790 --> 37:52.052
and then your body.

38:03.803 --> 38:06.414
Take your left
arm, swing it across!

38:06.545 --> 38:09.156
Break the grip.

38:09.243 --> 38:11.593
Get free, run away.

38:20.994 --> 38:25.041
Okay, I usually have to
do deep breaths for this,

38:25.128 --> 38:27.043
but this works too.

38:30.786 --> 38:33.876
You know...

38:33.963 --> 38:39.621
I never met anyone like
Billy before in my life.

38:39.708 --> 38:41.231
I mean, he could
make standing in line

38:41.319 --> 38:43.973
feel like the best date ever.

38:44.060 --> 38:45.758
We married three
months after we met.

38:45.845 --> 38:48.456
- Really?
- Yeah.

38:48.587 --> 38:50.850
In the beginning,
we were so in love.

38:50.980 --> 38:52.112
Unstoppable.

38:52.199 --> 38:55.594
You couldn't tell us nothin'.

38:55.681 --> 38:58.205
And then, about a month in,

38:58.292 --> 39:02.688
he had his first
bout with depression.

39:02.775 --> 39:04.603
He was unhappy, and
because he was unhappy,

39:04.733 --> 39:07.170
I had to be unhappy too.

39:07.301 --> 39:08.824
I'm sorry.

39:08.911 --> 39:13.176
He knew he had
this control over me.

39:13.263 --> 39:16.528
It was, like,
protective at first.

39:16.615 --> 39:18.660
And then...

39:18.791 --> 39:21.271
demeaning.

39:21.359 --> 39:25.319
He was never happy with me.
My hair, my clothes.

39:25.406 --> 39:28.714
I wasn't perfect in his eyes.

39:28.801 --> 39:34.633
He let me know it,
and I believed him, too.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.939
You think I'm crazy, huh?

39:37.026 --> 39:39.942
No, I don't think you're crazy.
You loved him.

39:40.029 --> 39:41.553
You wanted to see
the best in him.

39:41.640 --> 39:44.251
Yeah, but then it got worse.

39:46.819 --> 39:48.908
You don't have to tell me.

39:51.606 --> 39:54.000
It was all about my art.

39:54.087 --> 39:56.568
He knew how it made me feel.

39:56.655 --> 40:00.006
He even tried to get me
to stop going to art class.

40:00.093 --> 40:02.008
But I was determined.

40:02.095 --> 40:03.575
Good.

40:03.705 --> 40:06.882
One night, he was
in the backyard.

40:06.969 --> 40:09.929
I came out.

40:10.016 --> 40:13.498
All of my paintings,
he destroyed them.

40:13.585 --> 40:15.238
- What?
- Yeah.

40:15.325 --> 40:18.677
Um, when I tried to
regain my balance,

40:18.764 --> 40:21.375
he just knocked me
right back down,

40:21.506 --> 40:26.467
telling me I wasn't
talented, I was a waste.

40:26.554 --> 40:27.729
But I fought back.

40:27.816 --> 40:32.125
I fought toe to toe,
you know, like...

40:32.212 --> 40:34.606
- sticking up for myself.
- As you should.

40:38.479 --> 40:42.701
But then I realized
I couldn't stop him.

40:44.746 --> 40:48.315
And I remember, man.
I remember his face every time.

40:48.402 --> 40:50.709
It was like...

40:50.839 --> 40:55.061
Like he was satisfied

40:55.191 --> 40:58.543
with destroying me every time.

40:59.935 --> 41:01.633
And--and then
that's when I knew,

41:01.720 --> 41:06.376
if I did not get out,
he would win.

41:06.507 --> 41:10.293
But...I didn't leave.

41:10.380 --> 41:12.905
I stayed.

41:13.035 --> 41:17.823
I stopped--stopped
fighting, just took it...

41:17.910 --> 41:21.479
his words.

41:21.609 --> 41:24.090
And then I would
be like, you know,

41:24.220 --> 41:27.876
go into, like, a comatose state.

41:28.007 --> 41:30.096
Try to disassociate.

41:30.226 --> 41:35.318
I--I know it was a survival
technique at that point,

41:35.405 --> 41:37.059
you know, like playing dead?

41:37.190 --> 41:38.496
Yeah.

41:40.759 --> 41:44.240
To get to that point,
to...

41:44.371 --> 41:47.374
to go there...

41:47.461 --> 41:49.768
it killed my spirit.

41:49.855 --> 41:51.596
Did he ever hit you?

41:51.683 --> 41:53.946
No, not until that night.

41:56.514 --> 42:00.430
And now every image of
him is violent, you know?

42:00.518 --> 42:04.260
Him grabbing me,
grabbing my wrist,

42:04.347 --> 42:07.176
his hands around my throat.

42:07.263 --> 42:09.396
It's all I see
when I think of him.

42:12.181 --> 42:13.705
But today--

42:13.835 --> 42:17.839
let me tell you
what I realized today.

42:17.970 --> 42:20.886
On that mat, I realized

42:20.973 --> 42:26.674
that my spirit, this spirit,

42:26.761 --> 42:29.068
has so much more life to live.

42:30.896 --> 42:33.376
And I'm ready to fight back.

42:33.463 --> 42:34.769
Let's do it.

42:34.900 --> 42:36.554
Let's do it!

42:36.641 --> 42:37.729
I'm ready to use this one.

42:37.816 --> 42:38.991
- No!
- Yes!

42:39.078 --> 42:40.253
- Not that one!
- Mm-hmm.

42:40.383 --> 42:41.559
I've had enough of
that one for today.

42:49.131 --> 42:50.524
I feel so good.

42:50.611 --> 42:53.919
I feel...strong.

42:54.049 --> 42:56.922
I feel like my energy's up.

42:57.052 --> 42:59.620
Of course, you know, sure I was
a bit awkward in the beginning,

42:59.707 --> 43:02.841
but I know some moves now,

43:02.971 --> 43:06.192
and I'm ready for him
if he's coming for me.

43:06.279 --> 43:09.456
- Billy?
- Whoever's coming for me.

43:09.587 --> 43:13.025
Okay, warrior queen.

43:13.155 --> 43:15.897
But there's something.

43:17.507 --> 43:19.161
Maybe Billy's coming
at ya from the grave.

43:19.248 --> 43:21.860
What's the matter?
What is it?

43:21.947 --> 43:25.733
I did a deep dive into
your home finances, and...

43:25.864 --> 43:28.170
Billy spent a lot
of money each month.

43:28.301 --> 43:30.999
A lot more than he made.

43:31.086 --> 43:32.871
How is that even possible?

43:32.958 --> 43:34.176
The shade of it all.

43:34.307 --> 43:36.831
He was careful to
cover his tracks.

43:36.962 --> 43:42.402
But obviously, he had
another income stream.

43:42.489 --> 43:44.970
Am I involved in
something illegal?

43:45.057 --> 43:48.843
I'll go through it.
But the good news is...

43:48.930 --> 43:52.499
no matter how hard you try to
hide it, money leaves a trail.

43:52.586 --> 43:55.328
The dark always
comes into the light.

44:05.991 --> 44:08.820
What the hell?
Who covered the paintings?

44:08.950 --> 44:10.996
It was him.
I know it was him.

44:11.126 --> 44:12.084
Who?

44:12.171 --> 44:13.781
Billy.

44:13.868 --> 44:15.348
Can you see him?

44:15.435 --> 44:17.089
No, of course not.

44:18.264 --> 44:20.353
Oh my god, the art pieces.

44:23.356 --> 44:25.619
Oh, come on, no.

44:25.706 --> 44:27.752
Please, please, please,
please, please, please...

44:27.882 --> 44:29.754
Okay.

44:30.711 --> 44:31.930
All right, all right.

44:32.060 --> 44:33.714
Please no, please no, please no.

44:33.801 --> 44:35.455
Thank god.

44:35.542 --> 44:37.936
I'm surprised he didn't
destroy this one.

44:38.066 --> 44:39.372
You know what?

44:39.459 --> 44:40.895
We gotta get these
projects outta here.

44:40.982 --> 44:42.418
They're way too important
and they mean so much.

44:42.549 --> 44:44.812
Why are you so
convinced it's him?

44:44.943 --> 44:47.467
Because he always found a
way to diminish what I do.

44:47.597 --> 44:50.035
But he can't do that now.

44:50.165 --> 44:52.428
- Not anymore.
- I know, but--

44:52.515 --> 44:53.647
But he's dead.

44:55.518 --> 44:57.738
He's dead.
Billy is dead.

44:57.869 --> 45:00.436
Don't you think it's
time to accept that?

45:00.523 --> 45:02.830
See, I knew I couldn't
be this person for you.

45:02.961 --> 45:06.921
You--you just have this
idea of me, this picture--

45:07.052 --> 45:08.880
I can't be all bright
and shiny for you.

45:09.010 --> 45:10.359
I don't need you to be
bright and shiny, Jules--

45:10.446 --> 45:11.621
You know what?

45:11.709 --> 45:13.536
What are you doing?

45:16.626 --> 45:18.672
- That's what you want?
- No, that's not what I want.

45:21.022 --> 45:22.415
You know what?
Come on, I'm taking you--

45:22.545 --> 45:23.982
I can find
my own way home.

45:26.462 --> 45:28.421
This is who I am, Paul.

45:30.292 --> 45:31.729
And you can't handle it.

45:35.297 --> 45:36.864
You need to go.

45:38.039 --> 45:42.130
Leave. Go.

46:10.637 --> 46:12.247
What is that?

46:14.162 --> 46:16.469
Oh man, come on.

46:21.735 --> 46:23.606
Damn boys.

47:17.965 --> 47:19.358
Jules.

47:27.670 --> 47:29.368
Billy?

47:40.858 --> 47:41.554
Billy!

47:43.469 --> 47:44.992
Don't stab me, I just--I just--

47:45.079 --> 47:47.168
Naomi!

47:47.255 --> 47:48.561
Sorry, I thought that,

47:48.691 --> 47:49.605
just with everything that
you're going through,

47:49.692 --> 47:50.868
it might be a nice gesture.

47:52.260 --> 47:53.522
What is--

47:53.653 --> 47:56.786
Did you see anyone?

47:56.874 --> 47:58.136
Did you see anybody?

47:58.223 --> 47:59.528
What?

47:59.659 --> 48:01.008
Did you see anyone
outside my window?

48:01.095 --> 48:02.618
No, no, there's no one out here.

48:02.749 --> 48:04.011
What--

48:04.142 --> 48:05.883
What is going on?

48:11.192 --> 48:14.892
I'm sorry, Naomi, I gotta
get the hell outta here.

48:14.979 --> 48:17.895
Kenny, change the locks.
I'll explain later.

48:37.523 --> 48:39.394
Dana, it's--it's Jules.

48:39.481 --> 48:41.222
I need you to meet
me at our spot.

48:41.309 --> 48:43.181
I'm really freaking
out right now.

49:03.157 --> 49:04.898
Jules!

49:04.985 --> 49:09.163
It's me, are you okay?

49:09.294 --> 49:11.687
I saw Billy.

49:11.818 --> 49:14.081
You're scaring me.

49:14.168 --> 49:15.604
He was there.

49:15.691 --> 49:18.042
There was this...

49:18.129 --> 49:21.262
This one time, he got
really angry about dinner

49:21.393 --> 49:26.137
and he--he put all the food
in the garbage disposal

49:26.224 --> 49:29.531
and let it run all night long,
and it just made this sound.

49:29.618 --> 49:32.099
Clunk, clunk,
clunk, clunk all night.

49:32.230 --> 49:33.144
And I heard it.

49:33.274 --> 49:34.493
You're not making any sense.

49:34.580 --> 49:36.930
Why don't you believe me?

49:37.061 --> 49:38.366
You have to sleep.

49:38.453 --> 49:39.411
No.

49:39.541 --> 49:41.935
You have to stop.
He's dead.

49:42.022 --> 49:45.678
No, he is coming for me.

49:45.808 --> 49:47.593
They found his body.

49:47.723 --> 49:51.031
We went to his funeral.

49:51.162 --> 49:53.816
- He's gone.
- He's coming for me.

50:02.434 --> 50:04.610
Look, I know this
is gonna sound crazy, but--

50:04.697 --> 50:05.872
I'm a lawyer!

50:05.959 --> 50:08.570
I'm used to crazy.

50:08.701 --> 50:11.269
I need you to file for
a new restraining order.

50:11.399 --> 50:13.053
Against your ex-husband?

50:13.140 --> 50:14.359
He's harassing me!

50:14.446 --> 50:16.796
He's dead! Jules!

50:16.883 --> 50:20.234
I told you, he tampered with
my home, with my appliances.

50:20.365 --> 50:21.714
And I...

50:21.801 --> 50:23.455
I think that he
killed my therapist.

50:23.585 --> 50:25.196
Do you have any proof?

50:25.283 --> 50:26.458
I'm here.

50:26.545 --> 50:28.677
Oh, fantastic.

50:28.764 --> 50:33.117
Um, Jules was just filling
me in on how her ex-husband,

50:33.204 --> 50:36.337
her dead husband, is,
uh, harassing her.

50:36.424 --> 50:37.599
What have you got?

50:37.730 --> 50:39.471
She's not far off.

50:39.601 --> 50:42.126
You're not gonna believe this.

50:42.213 --> 50:46.173
Jules, do you have any idea how
much money you and Billy had?

50:46.260 --> 50:48.436
Not to the penny, but...

50:48.567 --> 50:50.308
I mean, we had
joint checking account

50:50.395 --> 50:51.961
and a little bit of savings.

50:52.092 --> 50:54.660
Well, I found a
bit more than that.

50:54.747 --> 50:56.618
How much more?

50:56.749 --> 51:00.187
$10 million in hidden,
undisclosed accounts.

51:00.318 --> 51:04.670
$10 mil--no, that's impossible.

51:04.757 --> 51:07.064
Billy's firm did a lot
of business involving

51:07.194 --> 51:09.631
local city zoning
and real estate loans.

51:09.762 --> 51:11.590
It's entirely plausible
he was embezzling money

51:11.677 --> 51:13.809
and had been for years.

51:13.896 --> 51:15.507
But these accounts,

51:15.637 --> 51:18.727
they've shown activity
over the last two months.

51:18.814 --> 51:20.816
Well, that proves he's alive.

51:20.903 --> 51:22.079
No.

51:22.166 --> 51:24.211
All the transactions
were done by you.

51:24.298 --> 51:25.517
Me? I don't even--

51:25.604 --> 51:27.345
No, not you you.

51:27.432 --> 51:29.390
But a login with your name.

51:29.477 --> 51:31.523
He wanted you to have access.

51:31.610 --> 51:34.003
He wanted it to
look like motive.

51:34.091 --> 51:36.484
He must have a partner.

51:36.571 --> 51:39.487
How is this even possible?

51:39.574 --> 51:43.796
The divorce proceedings,
all assets split 50-50.

51:43.883 --> 51:46.103
It would've uncovered this.

51:46.190 --> 51:47.887
He didn't want that.

51:47.974 --> 51:50.324
But now that he's dead,
you own all the business.

51:50.455 --> 51:52.805
Therefore, you have a
right to these accounts.

51:52.935 --> 51:56.852
You've assumed them all
for better or for worse.

51:56.939 --> 52:00.813
Everything points to you.

52:00.900 --> 52:03.076
Still has his hands on me.

52:03.163 --> 52:04.773
Even in death.

52:38.807 --> 52:41.245
It's not very good.

52:41.375 --> 52:44.726
Art is subjective.

52:44.857 --> 52:47.903
Or it could just be bad.

52:48.034 --> 52:51.907
It's all about taking
that pain that's in here

52:51.994 --> 52:55.911
and getting it all
out on that canvas.

52:56.042 --> 52:59.045
Yeah, I'm gonna need
a few more canvasses.

52:59.176 --> 53:00.699
Me too.

53:02.788 --> 53:04.703
Maybe try some shading in here.

53:13.929 --> 53:15.279
Hey.

53:15.409 --> 53:17.368
You okay?

53:17.498 --> 53:19.152
Surviving.

53:19.283 --> 53:21.067
Your house is almost done.

53:21.198 --> 53:22.547
You need to put
it on the market.

53:22.634 --> 53:24.331
It's messing with your head.

53:24.462 --> 53:25.898
It's not gonna help.

53:25.985 --> 53:28.335
He's just gonna follow me.

53:28.466 --> 53:29.597
You know, when Billy was alive,

53:29.684 --> 53:31.512
he would do little
things like this.

53:31.643 --> 53:34.211
Let me know that
he was watching.

53:34.298 --> 53:36.648
That he was in control.

53:36.778 --> 53:40.695
I mean, how else do you
explain the disposal?

53:40.782 --> 53:43.132
My refrigerator door?

53:43.220 --> 53:46.179
Everything that you
told me earlier,

53:46.310 --> 53:48.355
he's back terrorizing me again.

53:48.486 --> 53:50.575
But Billy is not
terrorizing you.

53:50.662 --> 53:53.360
Not physically.

53:53.447 --> 53:54.883
You need to get
out of that house.

53:54.970 --> 53:57.016
The sooner, the better.

54:14.425 --> 54:15.904
Oh!

54:16.035 --> 54:17.689
It's Paul.

54:17.776 --> 54:19.691
Jules's Paul?

54:19.821 --> 54:21.519
Uh, well, no, no.

54:21.649 --> 54:22.998
I tried to be.

54:23.129 --> 54:24.435
I know you did.

54:24.522 --> 54:26.350
I wanna be there for her.

54:26.480 --> 54:28.787
Our girl's not doing so well.

54:28.917 --> 54:32.356
This--what's happening
may all be in her head,

54:32.443 --> 54:34.140
but she believes it.

54:34.227 --> 54:35.968
You've seen her.

54:36.098 --> 54:38.449
Maybe...

54:38.536 --> 54:40.407
Maybe I can keep an eye on her.

54:40.494 --> 54:44.411
Paul, she already thinks
a man is watching her.

54:44.498 --> 54:46.108
Maybe she's not ready.

54:46.195 --> 54:47.762
Let's give her some time?

54:49.590 --> 54:53.377
Apparently, being patient is
my most annoying quality, so...

54:53.464 --> 54:56.641
Yeah, she can take as
much time as she wants.

54:56.728 --> 54:58.860
I'll be here.
Hey, have a good day.

54:58.991 --> 55:01.167
- It was nice meeting you.
- You too.

55:18.619 --> 55:20.708
What are you saying, dear?

55:20.795 --> 55:23.885
I do miss you.

55:23.972 --> 55:27.324
When you left him,
you left me as well.

55:27.411 --> 55:30.979
Now that Billy's
gone, I'm alone.

55:31.110 --> 55:33.460
That's what I wanted
to ask you about.

55:33.591 --> 55:35.854
Do you see anyone else?

55:35.941 --> 55:39.031
I guess I see the
people at the club.

55:39.161 --> 55:40.946
And I do have my standing
Arts Council meetings

55:41.033 --> 55:42.774
every Wednesday.

55:42.904 --> 55:44.384
That sounds nice.

55:44.471 --> 55:46.517
Yes, my life is very full.

55:47.605 --> 55:49.215
Listen, I know it's hard.

55:49.302 --> 55:52.174
You will never understand.

55:52.261 --> 55:53.480
A mother's love is as--

55:53.567 --> 55:58.572
I loved Billy too, once.

55:58.659 --> 56:00.357
No matter what my boy did,

56:00.487 --> 56:02.794
I could never take
him from this world.

56:02.924 --> 56:04.796
He tried to take me out.

56:04.926 --> 56:06.493
I left before he could--

56:06.580 --> 56:09.583
Look, I didn't come here
to conflict with you.

56:09.714 --> 56:12.499
It's just...

56:12.586 --> 56:14.632
I keep seeing him.

56:14.762 --> 56:17.243
I know what you mean.

56:17.374 --> 56:19.463
You do?

56:19.593 --> 56:21.813
Grief is tricky.

56:21.943 --> 56:23.815
Makes you see things.

56:23.902 --> 56:25.251
The people you love.

56:25.382 --> 56:26.383
You saw him?

56:26.470 --> 56:28.123
Just the other day, I was--

56:28.210 --> 56:31.823
I was leaving the
post office, you know,

56:31.953 --> 56:33.607
the one downtown near
Billy's old office.

56:33.738 --> 56:36.523
And when I look
towards the building...

56:36.610 --> 56:38.873
You saw him outside
of his office?

56:38.960 --> 56:40.397
But what was he doing?
Where was he going?

56:40.527 --> 56:42.094
He wasn't really there, dear.

56:42.224 --> 56:45.793
I did a double take,
and he was gone.

56:45.924 --> 56:48.187
It's just grief.

56:48.274 --> 56:50.102
And wishful thinking.

56:52.844 --> 56:54.715
You didn't set that fire.

56:54.846 --> 56:56.325
You didn't kill my Billy.

56:56.456 --> 56:58.980
Of course not.

56:59.111 --> 57:01.983
The police came here.

57:02.114 --> 57:04.725
And they asked me.

57:04.812 --> 57:08.120
But frankly, I told them

57:08.207 --> 57:11.123
you didn't have it in you.

57:11.253 --> 57:13.342
You're not a strong
woman, Jules.

57:13.430 --> 57:16.781
You couldn't handle
him the way I did.

57:16.911 --> 57:19.479
Every day, I've got
to live with this.

57:19.566 --> 57:21.916
Billy's dead.

57:22.003 --> 57:24.876
I'm not so sure he is.

57:24.963 --> 57:26.878
What are you talking about?

57:26.965 --> 57:29.837
It's just I...

57:29.924 --> 57:31.752
I keep seeing him.

57:31.839 --> 57:34.712
No, you don't.

57:34.842 --> 57:39.238
Do you think that Billy
would ever fake his death?

57:39.368 --> 57:41.022
For what? For what purpose?

57:41.153 --> 57:44.983
I don't know, maybe
to get--get back at me.

57:45.070 --> 57:47.464
Selfish girl!

57:47.551 --> 57:50.075
What a horrible suggestion!

57:50.205 --> 57:52.643
You two had issues.

57:52.773 --> 57:57.909
But my boy would never shadow
my very existence on purpose.

57:58.039 --> 57:59.998
He would never put his
mother through all of this.

58:00.128 --> 58:01.826
This is not what I--

58:01.913 --> 58:03.697
You know what?
I think you need to leave.

58:03.784 --> 58:06.265
Come back here,
you making up stories?

58:06.352 --> 58:10.008
So my heart could just
break all over again?

58:10.138 --> 58:12.750
Get back at me for
what he did to you.

58:12.837 --> 58:13.968
Maybe I was wrong about you.

58:14.099 --> 58:18.190
You are--you are cruel.

58:18.277 --> 58:19.931
You need to leave, please.

58:20.018 --> 58:21.367
Please, just leave.

58:21.498 --> 58:22.455
That's not what I--

58:22.542 --> 58:24.196
Leave!

58:28.243 --> 58:29.593
You know she's innocent.

58:29.723 --> 58:31.420
I am following
the facts of the case.

58:31.508 --> 58:32.770
The info the lawyer
sent, though,

58:32.900 --> 58:34.902
will show she has access
to certain accounts,

58:34.989 --> 58:36.121
and that does not
help her case at all.

58:36.251 --> 58:37.426
It speaks to motive.

58:37.557 --> 58:40.908
Billy must have had a partner.

58:40.995 --> 58:43.041
You wanna be a good friend.
I understand that.

58:43.171 --> 58:45.565
But this does not
look good for Ms. Baker.

58:45.652 --> 58:48.481
I'm worried about her, what this
is doing to her mental state.

58:48.568 --> 58:49.787
She should see somebody.

58:49.917 --> 58:51.615
She can't. He's dead.

58:52.877 --> 58:55.140
Listen, I love her.

58:55.227 --> 58:57.316
But she is losing her grip.

58:57.446 --> 58:59.274
I know you have to do your job.

58:59.405 --> 59:01.320
But sister to sister?

59:01.407 --> 59:04.541
Can you just keep an eye on her?

59:04.628 --> 59:05.977
Please.

59:32.177 --> 59:33.744
All right.

59:43.536 --> 59:46.495
That's it.

59:46.626 --> 59:49.586
Okay.

59:49.673 --> 59:50.978
Enough is enough.

59:51.109 --> 59:53.720
Let's put some light
back into this.

59:53.807 --> 59:55.940
Let's see if I can get this off.

1:00:06.298 --> 1:00:07.865
Boo!

1:00:10.824 --> 1:00:11.782
Billy?

1:00:18.136 --> 1:00:20.138
Billy?

1:00:20.268 --> 1:00:23.794
Hello, love.

1:00:23.924 --> 1:00:25.317
- Can--
- I am.

1:00:27.928 --> 1:00:29.234
- I'm calling the police.
- Good idea.

1:00:29.321 --> 1:00:33.325
Too bad they think
you already killed me.

1:00:33.412 --> 1:00:36.937
We had such a good
thing going on, baby.

1:00:37.068 --> 1:00:40.114
Until you ruined it.

1:00:40.245 --> 1:00:41.899
Two years, that's all I needed.

1:00:41.986 --> 1:00:45.206
Then we could've retired to the
Caribbean on a little island.

1:00:45.337 --> 1:00:48.601
Rum punch and
sunshine every day.

1:00:48.688 --> 1:00:54.389
Just the two of us,
happily ever after.

1:00:54.476 --> 1:00:56.653
Till death do us part.

1:01:00.657 --> 1:01:02.267
But you broke that vow.

1:01:06.097 --> 1:01:07.751
Ended when I saw you
with that lawyer.

1:01:09.448 --> 1:01:11.319
But you couldn't figure out
what I was up to.

1:01:11.406 --> 1:01:14.671
And I begged you not to go
through with that divorce,

1:01:14.758 --> 1:01:15.846
but did you listen to me?

1:01:15.933 --> 1:01:17.586
No.

1:01:17.717 --> 1:01:20.154
You never do.

1:01:20.241 --> 1:01:23.201
People go to prison
for what I did,

1:01:23.288 --> 1:01:25.682
and I wasn't going
to let that happen.

1:01:27.596 --> 1:01:29.598
Go ahead.

1:01:29.729 --> 1:01:32.384
Say it.

1:01:32.471 --> 1:01:35.213
Fake your own death.

1:01:39.957 --> 1:01:42.611
Look at us, look at us,
Billy and Jules.

1:01:42.742 --> 1:01:45.876
Together again,
just like old times.

1:01:51.925 --> 1:01:53.927
Maybe that's
your new Romeo.

1:01:54.014 --> 1:01:55.450
- Why don't you get it?
- You leave him alone.

1:01:55.537 --> 1:01:57.278
This is between me and you.

1:02:01.456 --> 1:02:04.459
Jules, uh, it--it's Paul.

1:02:04.590 --> 1:02:06.505
Look, I hate the
way we ended things.

1:02:06.592 --> 1:02:09.900
I'm gonna stop by the studio
and see if you're painting late.

1:02:09.987 --> 1:02:11.249
I'll see you soon, bye.

1:02:14.034 --> 1:02:16.689
Who died in that fire, Billy?
'Cause we know it wasn't you.

1:02:16.820 --> 1:02:20.214
John Franklin ring a bell?

1:02:20.301 --> 1:02:22.695
The homeless guy
from your office?

1:02:22.826 --> 1:02:26.133
Yeah, I know, a collision
of wants and needs.

1:02:26.220 --> 1:02:28.440
He wanted a place to stay,

1:02:28.527 --> 1:02:32.270
and I needed a body
no one would miss.

1:02:32.357 --> 1:02:33.401
You're a blood--

1:02:33.532 --> 1:02:35.490
No, you made me like this!

1:02:35.621 --> 1:02:39.233
I didn't want to
hurt anyone, Jules,

1:02:39.364 --> 1:02:43.629
but you kept pushing me
and pushing me and pushing me.

1:02:45.805 --> 1:02:47.981
What happened to Ron?

1:02:48.068 --> 1:02:49.853
Ron ran into a car.

1:02:52.725 --> 1:02:55.684
You're a very
dangerous person, too.

1:02:55.815 --> 1:02:57.730
You killed him.

1:02:57.861 --> 1:03:01.647
And you will for always
and forever be mine.

1:03:01.778 --> 1:03:02.691
Mm, no.

1:03:02.779 --> 1:03:04.955
Yes.

1:03:10.177 --> 1:03:11.657
No!

1:03:12.440 --> 1:03:14.181
Help!

1:03:14.268 --> 1:03:16.357
Help me!

1:03:16.444 --> 1:03:18.490
Jules, what's wrong?

1:03:18.577 --> 1:03:20.884
Aah, someone help me!

1:03:20.971 --> 1:03:22.842
Hey, hey, what's wrong?

1:03:22.929 --> 1:03:24.801
It was him. He was here!

1:03:24.931 --> 1:03:26.672
No, who, who, what happened?

1:03:26.759 --> 1:03:28.152
Billy, he was here.

1:03:31.155 --> 1:03:32.765
We gotta go to
the police because

1:03:32.852 --> 1:03:34.201
they think that I killed
him and he's alive.

1:03:34.288 --> 1:03:36.987
I swear to god he's alive.

1:03:37.117 --> 1:03:41.730
Shh, it's okay, it's okay.

1:03:49.913 --> 1:03:51.523
Detective Walker.

1:03:51.610 --> 1:03:53.351
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what's going on here?

1:03:53.438 --> 1:03:54.961
- He was here.
- Who?

1:03:55.092 --> 1:03:57.050
My ex-husband, he--he was
here and he threatened me.

1:03:57.181 --> 1:03:59.618
He's alive
and he's still out there.

1:03:59.705 --> 1:04:00.967
Did you see him?

1:04:01.054 --> 1:04:02.273
No, I heard her scream
and I ran inside.

1:04:02.403 --> 1:04:04.014
Did you see Mr. Moss?

1:04:05.015 --> 1:04:06.668
No.

1:04:06.799 --> 1:04:08.148
Let's just calm down, okay?

1:04:08.235 --> 1:04:09.758
So we can really figure out
what's going on here?

1:04:09.889 --> 1:04:11.891
Why are you here?

1:04:11.978 --> 1:04:14.372
Oh, your friend, Dana.

1:04:14.459 --> 1:04:16.069
There's new evidence
that your husband

1:04:16.200 --> 1:04:18.637
may have been involved
in illegal activity.

1:04:18.724 --> 1:04:20.769
Well, good, then you
can arrest him then.

1:04:20.857 --> 1:04:22.859
Yeah, not in the habit
of arresting dead people,

1:04:22.989 --> 1:04:25.774
but this might help your case.

1:04:25.905 --> 1:04:28.038
And what if he shows up
again and I'm not here?

1:04:28.125 --> 1:04:30.388
Well, you--you know what?

1:04:30.475 --> 1:04:32.869
If it's her husband,
call the media.

1:04:39.876 --> 1:04:41.399
I got something to tell you.

1:04:42.574 --> 1:04:44.576
Billy came to my studio.

1:04:46.534 --> 1:04:48.058
- Jules.
- I'm not imagining this.

1:04:48.145 --> 1:04:50.625
I just need you to
please believe me.

1:04:50.756 --> 1:04:52.671
Okay.

1:04:52.758 --> 1:04:54.891
But real talk?

1:04:54.978 --> 1:04:57.110
The only way you're
gonna get rid of Billy

1:04:57.197 --> 1:05:00.157
is to get everything
having to do with him out.

1:05:00.244 --> 1:05:03.203
This house, the finances...

1:05:03.290 --> 1:05:05.771
You haven't touched his office.

1:05:05.902 --> 1:05:07.425
We're gonna get
you through this.

1:05:09.166 --> 1:05:12.865
And then you can say
goodbye to Billy forever.

1:05:12.952 --> 1:05:14.649
Yeah, but I--

1:05:14.780 --> 1:05:16.086
I just need proof.

1:05:16.173 --> 1:05:17.739
I need something to
convince the police

1:05:17.826 --> 1:05:20.003
that Billy's behind this.

1:05:20.133 --> 1:05:22.135
Well, let me help you.

1:05:22.266 --> 1:05:25.008
Let me go close up his office,
see if there's something there.

1:05:25.095 --> 1:05:28.185
No, no, I cannot
let you do that.

1:05:28.272 --> 1:05:31.797
He's only gonna use you to
hurt me like he did with Ron.

1:05:31.928 --> 1:05:33.799
Promise me you
won't get involved.

1:05:35.583 --> 1:05:36.715
Promise.

1:05:37.977 --> 1:05:39.587
Promise.

1:05:40.893 --> 1:05:43.113
This coffee is not gonna do it.
I'll be right back.

1:06:11.271 --> 1:06:14.579
All right, Dana, you're gonna
go into the dead man's office,

1:06:14.709 --> 1:06:17.277
get the dead man's records,
then get the hell out.

1:06:28.810 --> 1:06:30.334
Whoo!

1:06:31.726 --> 1:06:33.946
There's nothing to be scared of.

1:06:34.033 --> 1:06:35.730
You're alive.

1:06:35.817 --> 1:06:39.647
No, I'm not.

1:06:39.778 --> 1:06:45.392
My wife killed me and now I see
you're doing her dirty work.

1:06:45.479 --> 1:06:47.786
Damn, Billy.

1:06:47.873 --> 1:06:49.875
You had us all snowed.

1:06:49.962 --> 1:06:52.008
Me included.

1:06:52.095 --> 1:06:54.097
We thought you were her savior.

1:06:54.184 --> 1:06:56.403
But you are
nothing but a crook.

1:06:56.534 --> 1:06:59.450
And I can prove it.

1:06:59.537 --> 1:07:01.060
I want her back.

1:07:01.147 --> 1:07:03.236
You have a funny
way of showing it.

1:07:03.367 --> 1:07:05.151
And she wants to
come back to me too.

1:07:05.238 --> 1:07:07.501
Wait, now that's the funny part.

1:07:09.460 --> 1:07:12.593
Jules trusted you.

1:07:12.724 --> 1:07:14.378
She believed you.
She called you her best friend.

1:07:14.465 --> 1:07:15.814
You--you must--

1:07:15.901 --> 1:07:17.903
I never told her to divorce you.

1:07:21.037 --> 1:07:24.344
You know, I actually
believe you.

1:07:24.431 --> 1:07:26.042
I don't care.

1:07:28.566 --> 1:07:30.916
I love Jules.

1:07:31.003 --> 1:07:34.615
I really don't give
a damn about you.

1:07:34.746 --> 1:07:36.922
If you leave, and I
mean leave for good,

1:07:37.053 --> 1:07:38.967
I'll tell Jules to hold
off for a few months.

1:07:39.098 --> 1:07:42.667
After that, all bets are off.

1:07:42.754 --> 1:07:44.756
You better be gone gone.

1:07:45.626 --> 1:07:47.367
It sounds better.

1:07:50.936 --> 1:07:55.071
Alive or dead, you're a dick.

1:08:30.367 --> 1:08:32.108
No, no!

1:08:33.109 --> 1:08:36.242
No, no, no.

1:08:37.460 --> 1:08:38.549
Dana!

1:08:40.420 --> 1:08:43.902
Oh my god, oh my god,
oh my god, oh my god...

1:08:48.819 --> 1:08:51.127
Uh, Detective Walker?

1:08:51.256 --> 1:08:53.999
Oh, Ms. Baker, now
who's following who?

1:08:54.085 --> 1:08:55.696
Can I talk to you?

1:08:55.827 --> 1:08:59.091
Please.

1:08:59.178 --> 1:09:01.137
I just came from my
best friend's funeral.

1:09:04.139 --> 1:09:05.663
All right, come on.

1:09:10.710 --> 1:09:13.627
You told me to come to you
if I had anything to...

1:09:15.760 --> 1:09:19.764
My best friend,
Dana, she saw Billy.

1:09:19.851 --> 1:09:22.419
She texted me.

1:09:22.505 --> 1:09:24.160
And now she's dead.

1:09:27.728 --> 1:09:29.556
And you think this
was a homicide.

1:09:29.687 --> 1:09:30.905
I know!

1:09:31.036 --> 1:09:32.167
Yeah, well,
I'm not quite following.

1:09:32.255 --> 1:09:34.779
Billy killed her.

1:09:34.908 --> 1:09:37.129
Okay, wait, whoa, okay.

1:09:37.260 --> 1:09:39.305
Let me get this straight.

1:09:39.392 --> 1:09:41.916
So you're saying
that Billy Moss,

1:09:42.047 --> 1:09:44.615
the man that we believe is dead,

1:09:44.745 --> 1:09:46.269
is not only alive,

1:09:46.398 --> 1:09:49.576
but he also murdered Dana Marks.

1:09:49.663 --> 1:09:52.274
- Yes.
- Why would he do that?

1:09:52.405 --> 1:09:53.885
What would be his motivation?

1:09:54.014 --> 1:09:55.495
To hurt me.

1:09:55.582 --> 1:09:57.671
To control me.

1:09:57.802 --> 1:09:59.195
Throughout our entire marriage,

1:09:59.282 --> 1:10:02.154
he was not okay
unless I was scared.

1:10:02.285 --> 1:10:05.157
And through most of our
marriage, I was terrified.

1:10:06.550 --> 1:10:08.856
I saw your reports.

1:10:08.943 --> 1:10:10.641
It's hard to prove the
kind of abuse you suffered,

1:10:10.771 --> 1:10:12.077
but I can tell.

1:10:13.557 --> 1:10:16.037
Your husband was an asshole.

1:10:16.168 --> 1:10:17.648
You believe me, the reports?

1:10:17.735 --> 1:10:20.737
Because the other detectives,
they--they didn't.

1:10:20.825 --> 1:10:22.087
According to the reports,

1:10:22.174 --> 1:10:23.871
you were unwilling
to leave Mr. Moss.

1:10:24.002 --> 1:10:27.223
I was scared to leave him.

1:10:27.309 --> 1:10:30.356
Wish I had the guts
to kill him then.

1:10:30.443 --> 1:10:33.316
You're asking me to swallow
a lot of conjecture.

1:10:33.403 --> 1:10:34.752
They found his body.

1:10:34.839 --> 1:10:37.145
They found a body.

1:10:37.233 --> 1:10:39.583
Yes, I saw the text.

1:10:39.670 --> 1:10:42.063
But do you have any more?

1:10:43.761 --> 1:10:46.677
Right now, the evidence
fits opposing stories--

1:10:46.764 --> 1:10:49.853
the theory of the
ex-wife seeking revenge

1:10:49.941 --> 1:10:52.857
and yours, the
abusive ex-husband

1:10:52.943 --> 1:10:55.860
who fakes his own death.

1:10:55.947 --> 1:10:58.166
- What does that mean?
- It means

1:10:58.254 --> 1:11:01.169
there's not enough
evidence for either.

1:11:01.300 --> 1:11:03.868
You have to
understand something.

1:11:03.998 --> 1:11:07.567
My superiors will never
authorize an investigation

1:11:07.698 --> 1:11:09.960
to look for a man
they think is dead.

1:11:12.093 --> 1:11:14.400
Oh.

1:11:14.531 --> 1:11:17.055
I appreciate you taking the
time to at least hear me out.

1:11:17.142 --> 1:11:22.234
Look, I've been doing this
job too damn long not to know

1:11:22.365 --> 1:11:24.802
that anybody can do anything
under the right circumstances.

1:11:24.889 --> 1:11:29.459
But I think you are the least
likely murderer I have ever met.

1:11:34.246 --> 1:11:36.422
Thank you.

1:11:36.509 --> 1:11:39.207
Be careful, Ms. Baker.

1:11:39.295 --> 1:11:40.861
Yes.

1:11:52.351 --> 1:11:53.787
I need to exhume a body.

1:11:58.401 --> 1:12:00.664
No, I'm not kidding.
When have you ever heard me kid?

1:12:11.762 --> 1:12:13.894
You should eat.

1:12:14.025 --> 1:12:17.245
She's dead 'cause of me.

1:12:17.333 --> 1:12:20.510
Jules, don't blame yourself.

1:12:20.597 --> 1:12:23.904
And she was trying to help
me, trying to find Billy.

1:12:24.035 --> 1:12:27.081
Billy did this, not you.

1:12:27.168 --> 1:12:29.300
You're not responsible.

1:12:29.388 --> 1:12:31.216
Did you just say
"Billy did this"?

1:12:31.347 --> 1:12:32.696
Yes.

1:12:34.785 --> 1:12:37.614
You believe me?

1:12:37.744 --> 1:12:41.661
Of course I believe you.

1:12:41.748 --> 1:12:43.315
Thanks.

1:12:45.621 --> 1:12:48.625
Dana, she asked me if
she could help look for him,

1:12:48.755 --> 1:12:51.148
and I told her not to,
but she just didn't listen.

1:13:00.376 --> 1:13:02.202
Well, you can't let Billy win.

1:13:07.165 --> 1:13:09.036
Abby,
sweetheart, where are you?

1:13:09.123 --> 1:13:10.864
Abby?

1:13:12.562 --> 1:13:14.433
My dad used to take me
and my brother fishing.

1:13:14.520 --> 1:13:16.130
He said the best
way to catch a fish

1:13:16.217 --> 1:13:19.003
is to use the bait
that it likes.

1:13:19.090 --> 1:13:21.179
I don't follow.

1:13:21.309 --> 1:13:24.050
A saucer of milk or a can of
tuna would help find Naomi's cat

1:13:24.138 --> 1:13:28.099
faster than her yelling
in the backyard.

1:13:28.228 --> 1:13:29.579
One moment.

1:13:32.538 --> 1:13:34.410
I think...

1:13:35.759 --> 1:13:37.369
You got the can of tuna.

1:13:49.990 --> 1:13:53.341
Predators can't resist the bait.

1:13:53.429 --> 1:13:56.300
Same thing applies
to psychopaths.

1:13:56.388 --> 1:13:58.999
Apparently, I'm
Billy's can of tuna.

1:13:59.130 --> 1:14:02.960
Yeah, he--he definitely
wants you, but...

1:14:03.047 --> 1:14:05.179
He seems to go after
people around you.

1:14:05.266 --> 1:14:07.181
I think we can use
that against him,

1:14:07.268 --> 1:14:11.184
dangle the different
kind of bait.

1:14:11.316 --> 1:14:14.232
- Yeah, me.
- No.

1:14:14.318 --> 1:14:16.495
He does seem to go after
people that love you.

1:14:16.626 --> 1:14:17.931
Love?

1:14:18.018 --> 1:14:19.498
Okay, let's do
a full stop on that one.

1:14:19.585 --> 1:14:22.327
We can come back to that
at a--at a later time.

1:14:22.414 --> 1:14:25.764
But why don't you let me
help you try to find him?

1:14:25.896 --> 1:14:28.028
He's coming either way.

1:14:28.115 --> 1:14:30.553
I just want it to
be on my terms.

1:14:30.683 --> 1:14:32.772
Now, we need something
to make him so angry

1:14:32.903 --> 1:14:36.950
that he comes now, you know,
when I'm prepared for it,

1:14:37.037 --> 1:14:40.171
like...forced
perspective in art.

1:14:40.258 --> 1:14:42.913
We make him see what
we want him to see.

1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:44.480
We create an illusion for him

1:14:44.610 --> 1:14:48.222
that makes coming
after me irresistible.

1:14:48.309 --> 1:14:50.616
What kind of illusion?

1:14:50.702 --> 1:14:52.791
Control.

1:14:56.143 --> 1:14:57.928
Wow.

1:14:58.014 --> 1:15:00.407
Yeah, the fire door
has saved all of this.

1:15:00.539 --> 1:15:02.193
- Can you grab that box for me?
- Yeah.

1:15:03.889 --> 1:15:07.023
I used to think he was spying
on me when he was at work.

1:15:07.111 --> 1:15:08.808
Ripped all the cameras
out and put 'em in here.

1:15:08.895 --> 1:15:10.723
But we could put 'em back up.

1:15:10.809 --> 1:15:12.682
Sign me up.

1:15:24.128 --> 1:15:27.000
Okay, he'll get an alert
once the app is live,

1:15:27.087 --> 1:15:29.002
after we get done
setting them all up.

1:15:29.133 --> 1:15:30.438
That'll get him watching.

1:15:30.568 --> 1:15:33.659
Great, one down, seven to go.

1:15:33.746 --> 1:15:35.052
And I called the banks.

1:15:35.139 --> 1:15:37.707
I changed the passwords
and I closed him out

1:15:37.794 --> 1:15:40.231
on all of his accounts.
I mean, it was easy.

1:15:40.318 --> 1:15:43.930
My name is on all of them.

1:15:44.061 --> 1:15:46.106
What, I just thought we
needed some extra bait.

1:15:47.760 --> 1:15:50.154
Who's that? Hm.

1:15:50.284 --> 1:15:52.330
Well, now
it's time for our tuna.

1:15:58.249 --> 1:16:01.165
Wow, you look beautiful.

1:16:01.252 --> 1:16:03.254
Well, thank you.

1:16:06.344 --> 1:16:08.172
Wanna play some music?

1:16:08.259 --> 1:16:10.000
Whatever you like.

1:16:10.087 --> 1:16:11.654
I couldn't have asked
for a better night,

1:16:11.741 --> 1:16:14.918
so thank you, Paul.

1:16:15.005 --> 1:16:17.094
You're welcome.

1:16:19.096 --> 1:16:21.098
You continuously impress me.

1:16:23.404 --> 1:16:27.234
Well, I hope the
night isn't over.

1:16:27.321 --> 1:16:29.062
You sure?

1:16:29.193 --> 1:16:31.761
I don't wanna rush you.

1:16:31.848 --> 1:16:34.285
I'm sure.

1:16:34.371 --> 1:16:37.027
Kiss me, Paul.

1:16:47.951 --> 1:16:50.344
I need to lure him upstairs.

1:16:50.475 --> 1:16:53.434
Okay, yeah, I could
hide behind the tarp.

1:16:53.521 --> 1:16:55.480
And I'll be downstairs
in the living room.

1:16:55.567 --> 1:16:57.612
And the first sign of him,
I'm up the stairs.

1:16:57.700 --> 1:16:59.702
No, no, I don't want you
risking your life like this.

1:16:59.832 --> 1:17:02.182
We're both risking our lives.

1:17:02.269 --> 1:17:04.750
You just need to call the
police as soon as he arrives.

1:17:04.880 --> 1:17:07.273
Then I run up the
stairs towards you.

1:17:07.361 --> 1:17:08.710
And then?

1:17:08.798 --> 1:17:10.407
And just like you taught me,

1:17:10.538 --> 1:17:13.803
get free, run away, down the
back stairs and out the door.

1:17:13.889 --> 1:17:15.326
Look, I just need
to prove he's alive.

1:17:15.413 --> 1:17:18.590
I don't ever need to
see that face again.

1:17:18.677 --> 1:17:19.939
Okay.

1:17:23.421 --> 1:17:25.423
Jules, be careful, all right?
Once he comes inside--

1:17:25.510 --> 1:17:28.034
I know, get free and run away.

1:18:08.205 --> 1:18:09.641
There you are!

1:18:09.728 --> 1:18:11.948
You bad girl!

1:18:12.077 --> 1:18:15.212
Abby, sweetheart.

1:18:15.299 --> 1:18:18.215
Oh my god.

1:18:19.999 --> 1:18:21.871
You found her!

1:18:22.001 --> 1:18:25.612
Naomi, what are you doing here?
You can't be here right now.

1:18:25.701 --> 1:18:28.660
I just--I wanted to thank
you for helping find Abby.

1:18:30.487 --> 1:18:33.491
You really hate him, don't you?

1:18:33.577 --> 1:18:35.754
- Billy?
- Yeah.

1:18:35.885 --> 1:18:38.496
No, I don't hate him.
I hate what he did to me.

1:18:38.583 --> 1:18:40.716
Oh, Jules, he...

1:18:40.803 --> 1:18:42.805
He was always a good man.

1:18:42.892 --> 1:18:44.850
Kind and compassionate and--

1:18:44.937 --> 1:18:46.634
No, no, no, no, that was an act.

1:18:46.722 --> 1:18:48.985
Billy terrorized me.
He lied to me.

1:18:49.072 --> 1:18:51.074
He made me feel diminished.

1:18:51.161 --> 1:18:53.424
- No, he didn't.
- I don't care what you believe.

1:18:53.511 --> 1:18:55.643
I'm telling you, Billy
is not a good man.

1:18:55.731 --> 1:18:57.080
Now, you have to go now!

1:18:57.210 --> 1:19:00.431
No, I don't.

1:19:00.518 --> 1:19:02.607
Excuse me?

1:19:12.486 --> 1:19:13.618
Surprise.

1:19:22.670 --> 1:19:24.977
You should thank Naomi,
she's been very helpful.

1:19:25.108 --> 1:19:29.329
Driving you crazy has
been a bonding experience.

1:19:29.460 --> 1:19:34.900
Now, I need you to
unlock those accounts.

1:19:34.987 --> 1:19:37.468
- No.
- Now!

1:19:37.598 --> 1:19:40.036
- Maybe--
- Just give me a minute.

1:19:43.300 --> 1:19:45.128
Now, Naomi thinks
I came here to talk,

1:19:45.215 --> 1:19:46.782
but we both know how this ends.

1:19:48.392 --> 1:19:50.263
Bill, you said you'd be
done with this tonight.

1:19:50.350 --> 1:19:53.963
- Baby, I love you--
- Plans change.

1:19:54.093 --> 1:19:57.531
Billy, I just want her gone.

1:19:57.662 --> 1:19:59.446
I sent the gas valve
to the police

1:19:59.532 --> 1:20:00.708
'cause I knew that
they would suspect her.

1:20:00.796 --> 1:20:02.232
I just want this
to be over so that

1:20:02.362 --> 1:20:04.059
you and I can finally be
together like we talked about!

1:20:06.584 --> 1:20:07.803
You know I have the hammer with

1:20:07.889 --> 1:20:10.501
your fingerprints
all over it, right?

1:20:10.588 --> 1:20:12.023
Now, I don't wanna have
to do anything with it,

1:20:12.111 --> 1:20:14.984
but I will if I have to.

1:20:15.071 --> 1:20:18.814
This is not the way to start
a healthy relationship, Naomi.

1:20:18.901 --> 1:20:21.425
I did all of this
for you, for--for us!

1:20:21.512 --> 1:20:22.513
There is no us!

1:20:22.643 --> 1:20:23.862
How could you possibly say that?

1:20:23.949 --> 1:20:24.994
You know that we
had talked about--

1:20:28.040 --> 1:20:29.346
Oh my god, what did you do!?

1:20:32.305 --> 1:20:33.089
Loose ends.

1:20:39.617 --> 1:20:41.358
Here I come!

1:20:41.487 --> 1:20:43.012
Let's fight!

1:20:49.366 --> 1:20:53.849
People kill their next-door
neighbors every day!

1:20:53.936 --> 1:20:56.547
Especially people
with mental problems

1:20:56.677 --> 1:21:00.377
and dangerous hallucinations.

1:21:00.507 --> 1:21:03.206
Now, this is full of your DNA.

1:21:05.643 --> 1:21:08.646
911,
what is your emergency?

1:21:08.733 --> 1:21:11.170
Jules!

1:21:11.257 --> 1:21:13.781
Don't hang up,
we're tracking your location.

1:21:13.869 --> 1:21:16.784
If I can't have you,
no one else can!

1:21:52.864 --> 1:21:54.344
We used to love
each other, remember?

1:21:54.474 --> 1:21:56.041
Shut up!

1:21:56.172 --> 1:21:58.391
You know this is not the
way you wanted it to end.

1:21:58.522 --> 1:21:59.697
You just need help.

1:21:59.784 --> 1:22:02.439
I don't need help!

1:22:02.526 --> 1:22:06.398
I needed time.

1:22:06.530 --> 1:22:09.750
And when I died, that stopped
your stupid divorce stuff.

1:22:09.880 --> 1:22:13.014
I started transferring money,
tried to build a life for us.

1:22:16.975 --> 1:22:18.063
But you thought
you could move on.

1:22:18.193 --> 1:22:21.197
That cannot happen!

1:22:21.327 --> 1:22:23.851
The insurance...

1:22:23.982 --> 1:22:26.942
I really wanted
that to work for us.

1:22:27.029 --> 1:22:32.469
Jules, I really, I really...

1:22:32.599 --> 1:22:34.862
We would've been
fugitives and on the run,

1:22:34.950 --> 1:22:36.864
but we would have
been rich and in love,

1:22:36.952 --> 1:22:38.779
and that's all
I ever wanted from you!

1:22:41.826 --> 1:22:43.827
Or that till death
to us part thing.

1:22:46.048 --> 1:22:47.309
That's happening.

1:22:47.397 --> 1:22:48.659
You first!

1:23:00.410 --> 1:23:03.369
Paul, are you okay?

1:23:03.456 --> 1:23:05.502
Yeah, I'm only
worried about you.

1:23:08.505 --> 1:23:09.985
Jules!

1:23:18.645 --> 1:23:21.257
Okay, sit up, sit up.

1:23:21.387 --> 1:23:22.910
I got you.

1:23:34.574 --> 1:23:36.750
Jules! Ms. Baker!

1:23:36.880 --> 1:23:38.709
Yeah, we're up here!
We need help!

1:23:41.712 --> 1:23:43.018
I got you.

1:23:43.888 --> 1:23:45.541
We're up here.

1:24:01.558 --> 1:24:04.822
So I--I added shading here
to give me more depth.

1:24:04.952 --> 1:24:06.954
Jules suggested it, so...

1:24:07.085 --> 1:24:08.434
I love it.

1:24:08.565 --> 1:24:10.132
Oh, gosh.

1:24:10.262 --> 1:24:12.568
All right, here you are.

1:24:12.699 --> 1:24:17.052
Jules, you have
outdone yourself.

1:24:17.182 --> 1:24:20.184
I can't believe that many
people came to see our artwork.

1:24:20.272 --> 1:24:22.753
I mean, Expressions of
Courage and Strength?

1:24:22.840 --> 1:24:24.233
Who doesn't wanna see that?

1:24:24.320 --> 1:24:26.017
- You hear that, babe?
- Yes.

1:24:26.148 --> 1:24:28.976
I got strength and courage
coming on all up in here.

1:24:29.064 --> 1:24:30.674
I'm so proud of you.

1:24:30.761 --> 1:24:32.067
Awww!

1:24:32.197 --> 1:24:33.155
I'm kind of proud of me.

1:24:34.764 --> 1:24:35.940
Oh, excuse me.

1:24:37.637 --> 1:24:40.945
Detective Walker.

1:24:41.032 --> 1:24:42.990
It's good to see you.

1:24:43.121 --> 1:24:44.469
Didn't mean to
intrude on your event.

1:24:44.557 --> 1:24:46.690
Oh no, it's not a problem.

1:24:46.777 --> 1:24:49.040
I wanted you to know the body we
uncovered has been identified as

1:24:49.127 --> 1:24:50.911
John Franklin.

1:24:50.998 --> 1:24:53.653
Transient.

1:24:53.740 --> 1:24:56.352
Thank you, Detective,
for everything,

1:24:56.482 --> 1:24:57.614
for believing me.

1:24:57.701 --> 1:24:59.616
I didn't until it
was almost too late,

1:24:59.702 --> 1:25:02.880
but that was just bad
detective work on my part.

1:25:02.967 --> 1:25:04.447
Well, that's not how I see it.

1:25:06.144 --> 1:25:08.364
One more thing.

1:25:08.451 --> 1:25:13.847
The insurance payout for
your house is officially yours.

1:25:13.934 --> 1:25:15.327
Case closed.

1:25:15.414 --> 1:25:17.460
Thank you again.

1:25:17.547 --> 1:25:19.723
Enjoy your party.

1:25:19.809 --> 1:25:23.466
Ah, everything looks great!

1:25:23.553 --> 1:25:25.424
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1:25:25.555 --> 1:25:28.210
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1:25:29.124 --> 1:25:32.562
So now that your
show is a success,

1:25:32.692 --> 1:25:34.607
have you thought about what
your next art show should be?

1:25:34.693 --> 1:25:37.915
Well, I was thinking
nude figure, but

1:25:38.002 --> 1:25:39.656
I would need a model for that.

1:25:42.137 --> 1:25:43.355
Mm-hmm.

1:25:45.052 --> 1:25:46.489
But before all that, do--

1:25:46.576 --> 1:25:48.230
do you remember
what you said to me

1:25:48.360 --> 1:25:50.536
in the backyard?

1:25:50.623 --> 1:25:53.713
Mm...it slipped my mind.

1:25:53.800 --> 1:25:56.368
Come on, stop playing.

1:25:56.499 --> 1:25:58.588
Yeah.

1:25:58.675 --> 1:26:00.633
I said that I love you.

1:26:03.984 --> 1:26:05.986
- Guess what?
- Hm?

1:26:06.073 --> 1:26:08.337
I love you too.
