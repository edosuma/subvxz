01:04.648 --> 01:06.016
TO OUR MAIN STORY THIS WEEK,

01:06.083 --> 01:07.284
VARIOUS CORN.

01:07.350 --> 01:08.151
OH!

01:08.218 --> 01:09.486
THAT'S ACTUALLY A SURPRISE!

01:09.553 --> 01:10.821
I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO TALK

01:10.887 --> 01:11.855
ABOUT SOMETHING DEPRESSING,

01:11.922 --> 01:14.724
BUT INSTEAD ‐‐ WAIT A MINUTE!

CORONAVIRUS, IS THAT YOU?

01:16.259 --> 01:17.928
YOU SNEAKY LITTLE BUGGER.

01:17.994 --> 01:19.830
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

01:19.896 --> 01:21.331
IT'S ALWAYS YOU, CORONAVIRUS!

01:21.398 --> 01:24.367
YOU'RE AN ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE!

01:24.434 --> 01:26.503
THE FACT IS, COVID‐19 IS STILL

01:26.570 --> 01:27.938
DOMINATING THE NEWS EVERY DAY,

01:28.004 --> 01:29.239
AND IT'S HARD TO KEEP UP WITH

01:29.306 --> 01:30.407
ALL THE INFORMATION ABOUT IT ‐‐

01:30.474 --> 01:31.341
TO SAY NOTHING OF THE

01:31.408 --> 01:33.176
MISINFORMATION.

01:33.243 --> 01:34.911

01:36.613 --> 01:38.715
THE COVID‐19 VIRUS.

01:38.782 --> 01:39.616
MAIL IS NOT FOOD AND YOU

01:39.683 --> 01:42.219
CAN'T COOK IT.

01:42.285 --> 01:43.987
>> GARLIC DOES HAVE SOME

01:44.054 --> 01:45.122
ANTIMICROBIAL PROPERTIES BUT

01:45.188 --> 01:47.224
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE

01:47.290 --> 01:50.460
THAT IT KILLS COVID‐19.

01:50.527 --> 01:51.928
>> ADULTS ARE NOW BUYING

01:51.995 --> 01:53.997
BREAST MILK BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE

01:54.064 --> 01:55.632
IT CAN PROTECT THEM FROM

01:55.699 --> 01:56.600
COVID‐19.

01:56.666 --> 01:57.200
>> DO NOT BUY BREAST MILK TO

01:57.267 --> 01:57.934
PREVENT COVID.

01:58.001 --> 01:58.602
THAT IS NOT GOING TO HELP YOU.

01:58.668 --> 01:59.269
NO.

01:59.336 --> 02:00.537
>> John: NO, IT ISN'T!

02:00.604 --> 02:01.271
YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY NOT BE

02:02.139 --> 02:05.208
BREAST MILK TO PROTECT YOU FROM

02:05.275 --> 02:06.143
THE CORONAVIRUS.

02:06.209 --> 02:06.843
NOT ONLY WILL IT NOT WORK,

02:06.910 --> 02:07.911
YOU'RE TAKING IT AWAY FROM

02:07.978 --> 02:09.212
THE BABIES AND THE PERVERTS WHO

02:09.279 --> 02:11.615
GENUINELY NEED IT.

02:11.681 --> 02:13.016
NOW UNFORTUNATELY, BULLSHIT

02:13.083 --> 02:14.184
REGARDING THIS VIRUS IS

02:14.251 --> 02:15.018
WIDESPREAD, AND PEOPLE ARE

02:15.085 --> 02:16.153
ACTING ON IT.

02:16.219 --> 02:17.721
JUST THIS WEEK, WE SAW PROTESTS

02:17.787 --> 02:19.890
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AGAINST

02:19.956 --> 02:20.924
STAY‐AT‐HOME ORDERS.

02:20.991 --> 02:22.325
AND SOME OF THE ATTENDEES ‐‐

02:22.392 --> 02:23.059
LIKE AT MICHIGAN'S

02:23.126 --> 02:24.461
"OPERATION GRIDLOCK" ‐‐ SEEMED

02:24.528 --> 02:25.662
MOTIVATED BY VERY QUESTIONABLE

02:25.729 --> 02:27.063
INFORMATION.

02:27.130 --> 02:28.565
>> WHAT ABOUT CONCERNS FOR

02:28.632 --> 02:30.700
SAFETY AND SPREADING THIS VIRUS

02:30.767 --> 02:31.268
AND POTENTIALLY KILLING MORE

02:31.334 --> 02:33.436
PEOPLE?

02:33.503 --> 02:34.738
>> I THINK IT'S ALL HYPE.

02:34.804 --> 02:37.607
>> WE'RE AGAINST THESE BIG

02:37.674 --> 02:40.377
CORPORATES THAT ARE TRYING TO

02:40.443 --> 02:41.678
RACK IN ALL THESE DOLLARS WHO

02:41.745 --> 02:43.580
CREATED THE DISEASE AND NOW WANT

02:43.647 --> 02:45.015
TO MAKE PEOPLE PAY FOR THE CURE.

02:45.081 --> 02:45.815
>> THE FLU KILLS MORE PEOPLE

02:45.882 --> 02:47.517
THAN THIS DOES!

02:47.584 --> 02:48.785
>> John: OKAY, WHAT'S WORRYING

02:48.852 --> 02:50.487
ABOUT THAT ‐‐ OTHER THAN

02:50.554 --> 02:51.788
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING ‐‐ IS THAT

02:51.855 --> 02:53.156
YOU MAY HAVE EVEN HEARD THOSE

02:53.223 --> 02:57.093
ARGUMENTS FROM PEOPLE YOU'RE

02:57.160 --> 02:57.694
RELATED TO OR PEOPLE YOU LOVE.

02:57.761 --> 02:58.195
WHICH CAN, INCIDENTALLY,

02:58.261 --> 02:59.362
BE TWO VERY DISTINCT GROUPS.

02:59.429 --> 03:00.830
POLLS SHOW THAT, WHEN ASKED

03:00.897 --> 03:02.999
ABOUT THE DEATH RATE, 40% OF

03:03.066 --> 03:04.134
AMERICANS BELIEVE COVID‐19 IS

03:04.201 --> 03:05.602
LESS DEADLY OR JUST AS DEADLY

03:05.669 --> 03:06.670
AS THE FLU.

03:06.736 --> 03:09.506
WHICH IT'S NOT.

03:09.573 --> 03:11.508
IT IS MANY TIMES DEADLIER.

03:11.575 --> 03:12.976
COMPARING THE CORONAVIRUS TO

03:13.043 --> 03:14.611
THE FLU IS LIKE COMPARING

03:14.678 --> 03:15.979
JEFFREY DAHMER TO O. J. SIMPSON.

03:16.046 --> 03:17.581
I'M NOT SAYING O. J. IS GREAT,

03:17.647 --> 03:19.249
I'M JUST SAYING HE WOULDN'T HAVE

03:19.316 --> 03:19.749
EVEN FILLED UP DAHMER'S

03:19.816 --> 03:20.984
VEGETABLE DRAWER.

03:21.051 --> 03:23.253
AND BAD INFORMATION IS NOT ONLY

03:23.320 --> 03:25.222
FRUSTRATING, TO THE EXTENT IT

03:25.288 --> 03:26.423
MOTIVATES PEOPLE TO IGNORE

03:26.489 --> 03:27.991
STAY‐AT‐HOME MEASURES, IT'S BOTH

03:28.058 --> 03:29.259
DANGEROUS AND COULD ACTUALLY END

03:29.326 --> 03:30.627
UP FORCING US TO STAY AT HOME

03:30.694 --> 03:31.494
FOR LONGER.

03:31.561 --> 03:33.196
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING,

03:33.263 --> 03:34.397
"HOW CAN PEOPLE POSSIBLY BELIEVE

03:34.464 --> 03:36.600
SHIT LIKE THAT?"

03:36.666 --> 03:37.801
THAT'S ACTUALLY OUR STORY

03:37.867 --> 03:39.869
TONIGHT: THE BAD INFORMATION

03:39.936 --> 03:41.671
FLYING AROUND ABOUT THIS VIRUS,

03:41.738 --> 03:42.939
AND THE PLACES PEOPLE ARE

03:43.006 --> 03:44.040
GETTING IT FROM.

03:44.107 --> 03:45.542
BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF MEDIA

03:45.609 --> 03:47.310
BUBBLES OUT THERE, AND GETTING

03:47.377 --> 03:48.878
A GLIMPSE OUTSIDE OF THE ONE

03:48.945 --> 03:50.947
YOU'RE IN CAN BE EYE‐OPENING.

03:51.014 --> 03:52.382
FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU'RE NOT A

03:52.449 --> 03:54.251
REGULAR VIEWER OF TELEVANGELIST

03:54.317 --> 03:55.585
AND HUMBLE PRIVATE JET FARMER

03:55.652 --> 03:57.721
KENNETH COPELAND, YOU MIGHT NOW

03:57.787 --> 03:58.688
KNOW THAT HE TOOK CARE OF

03:58.755 --> 04:01.424
COVID‐19 WEEKS AGO.

04:01.491 --> 04:01.725
>> COVID‐19!

04:01.791 --> 04:05.829
>> COVID‐19!

04:05.895 --> 04:06.696
>> [SPITS AND BLOWS AIR]

04:06.763 --> 04:07.998
>> [SPITS AND BLOWS AIR]

04:08.064 --> 04:09.833
>> I BLOW...

04:09.899 --> 04:10.900
>> I BLOW...

04:10.967 --> 04:12.235
>> THE WIND OF GOD...

04:12.302 --> 04:13.637
>> THE WIND OF GOD...

04:13.703 --> 04:14.604
>> ON YOU.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.039
>> ON YOU.

04:16.106 --> 04:18.375
>> YOU ARE DESTROYED FOREVER.

04:18.441 --> 04:20.910
>> YOU ARE DESTROYED FOREVER.

04:20.977 --> 04:22.846
>> AND YOU WILL NEVER BE BACK.

04:22.912 --> 04:25.815
>> AND YOU WILL NEVER BE BACK.

04:25.882 --> 04:27.851
>> John: OKAY, SETTING ASIDE

04:27.917 --> 04:29.819
HIS CREW OF THE FOUR WEENIEST

04:29.886 --> 04:31.321
HYPE MEN OF ALL TIME, SPITTING

04:31.388 --> 04:32.455
ALL OVER THE PLACE IS NOT GOING

04:32.522 --> 04:34.124
TO CURE ANYTHING.

04:34.190 --> 04:35.625
UNLESS YOUR PLAN IS TO GIVE THE

04:35.692 --> 04:37.227
CORONAVIRUS THE CORONAVIRUS, IN

04:37.294 --> 04:39.129
WHICH CASE: BEST OF LUCK TO YOU.

04:39.195 --> 04:39.863
ALTHOUGH I DO UNDERSTAND WHY

04:39.929 --> 04:41.064
COPELAND IS SO DETERMINED TO

04:41.131 --> 04:43.066
END THIS PANDEMIC.

04:43.133 --> 04:44.534
IF I ONLY HAD A FEW WEEKS UNTIL

04:44.601 --> 04:45.835
MY TRAGICALLY OBVIOUS HAIR DYE

04:45.902 --> 04:47.837
STARTED TO FADE, I'D BE ANXIOUS

04:47.904 --> 04:50.407
THAT MY COLORIST BE ALLOWED TO

04:50.473 --> 04:51.308
LEAVE THEIR HOME, TOO.

04:51.374 --> 04:52.142
ESPECIALLY IF I'D ALREADY

04:52.208 --> 04:53.977
CLAIMED ON MY ACTUAL WEBSITE

04:54.044 --> 04:56.279
THAT MY UNNATURALLY DARK HAIR

04:56.346 --> 04:57.414
AT THE AGE OF 82 WAS SIMPLY THE

04:57.480 --> 04:59.115
RESULT OF STANDING IN THE MIRROR

04:59.182 --> 05:01.184
AND SAYING, "GLORY TO GOD.

05:01.251 --> 05:02.952
HAIR, GROW DARK BROWN.

05:03.019 --> 05:04.954
THICK BE, IN THE NAME OF JESUS.

05:05.021 --> 05:06.423
BALD SPOTS, NO!"

05:06.489 --> 05:08.091
MY POINT IS: THERE'S A LOT AT

05:08.158 --> 05:09.959
STAKE HERE FOR KENNETH COPELAND.

05:10.026 --> 05:11.561
BUT THE TELEVANGELIST WORLD IS

05:11.628 --> 05:14.364
JUST ONE OF MANY BUBBLES.

05:14.431 --> 05:15.665
THERE'S ALSO AN ECOSYSTEM OF

05:15.732 --> 05:17.300
CONSPIRACY THEORIES, LIKE THE

05:17.367 --> 05:19.469
FALSE BELIEF THAT THE VIRUS WAS

05:19.536 --> 05:21.504
CAUSED BY 5G NETWORKS, SOMETHING

05:21.571 --> 05:22.972
THAT LED PEOPLE TO SET FIRE TO

05:23.039 --> 05:23.940
CELL TOWERS IN THE U. K.

05:24.007 --> 05:25.375
THIS MONTH.

05:25.442 --> 05:26.810
WHICH IS JUST RIDICULOUS,

05:26.876 --> 05:27.977
ALTHOUGH NOT AS RIDICULOUS AS

05:28.044 --> 05:29.846
THE FACT THAT THOSE FLAMING

05:29.913 --> 05:31.147
TOWERS ALMOST CERTAINLY STILL

05:31.214 --> 05:32.248
OFFERED BETTER COVERAGE THAN

05:32.315 --> 05:34.484
AT&T.

05:34.551 --> 05:35.251
OH, THAT'S RIGHT, BUSINESS

05:35.318 --> 05:36.286
DADDY!

05:36.353 --> 05:37.387
YOU THOUGHT A PANDEMIC WOULD

05:37.454 --> 05:38.254
BRING US TOGETHER?

05:38.321 --> 05:39.422
OF COURSE NOT.

05:39.489 --> 05:41.224
OUR FEUD MUST BE AN ESSENTIAL

05:41.291 --> 05:42.092
SERVICE BECAUSE IT IS STILL

05:42.158 --> 05:45.195
IN BUSINESS!

05:45.261 --> 05:46.596
SERIOUSLY, THOUGH, B. D.: I HOPE

05:46.663 --> 05:48.231
YOU'RE SAFE AND HEALTHY.

05:48.298 --> 05:49.799
I CAN'T WAIT TO TALK TO YOU AS

05:49.866 --> 05:51.468
SOON AS THIS IS OVER AND AS SOON

05:51.534 --> 05:52.502
AS I GET MORE THAN ONE BAR OF

05:52.569 --> 05:54.170
SERVICE.

05:54.237 --> 05:56.005
BUT HERE IN THE U. S., ONE OF

05:56.072 --> 05:57.640
THE BIGGEST AND MOST ROBUST

05:57.707 --> 05:58.942
BUBBLES IS THE RIGHT‐WING

05:59.008 --> 05:59.909
MEDIASPHERE.

05:59.976 --> 06:01.644
IT'S DOMINATED BY SOME

06:01.711 --> 06:03.646
ENORMOUSLY POWERFUL INDIVIDUALS,

06:03.713 --> 06:04.180
NOT JUST ON TV, BUT ‐‐

06:04.247 --> 06:06.282
IMPORTANTLY ‐‐ ON CONSERVATIVE

06:06.349 --> 06:07.350
TALK RADIO, WHERE THE MOST

06:07.417 --> 06:09.119
POWERFUL HOST IS UNDENIABLY

06:09.185 --> 06:10.854
RUSH LIMBAUGH, A MAN WITH

06:10.920 --> 06:12.021
MILLIONS OF LISTENERS,

06:12.088 --> 06:13.556
A PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM,

06:13.623 --> 06:15.558
AND, ALMOST CERTAINLY, A ROOM IN

06:15.625 --> 06:16.693
HIS BASEMENT THE HOUSEKEEPER

06:16.760 --> 06:17.727
ISN'T ALLOWED TO GO INTO.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.196
EVEN WELL INTO THE OUTBREAK,

06:20.263 --> 06:21.464
LIMBAUGH HAS BEEN SPOUTING SOME

06:21.531 --> 06:24.267
FABULOUSLY WRONG INFORMATION.

06:24.334 --> 06:25.502
HERE HE IS ON MARCH 11th:

06:25.568 --> 06:30.173
>> THIS CORONAVIRUS?

06:30.240 --> 06:32.041
JUST ‐‐ ALL OF THIS PANIC IS

06:32.108 --> 06:35.445
JUST NOT WARRANTED.

06:35.512 --> 06:38.848
I'M TELLING YOU,

06:38.915 --> 06:39.849
WHEN I TELL YOU ‐‐

06:39.916 --> 06:40.917
WHEN I'VE TOLD YOU THAT THIS

06:40.984 --> 06:41.651
VIRUS IS THE COMMON COLD?

06:41.718 --> 06:43.420
WHEN I SAID THAT, IT WAS BASED

06:43.486 --> 06:43.920
ON THE NUMBER OF CASES.

06:43.987 --> 06:44.821
IT'S ALSO BASED ON THE KIND OF

06:44.888 --> 06:45.388
VIRUS THIS IS.

06:45.455 --> 06:46.189
WHY DO YOU THINK THIS IS

06:46.256 --> 06:46.890
COVID‐19?

06:46.956 --> 06:47.924
THIS IS THE 19TH CORONAVIRUS!

06:47.991 --> 06:48.858
THEY'RE NOT UNCOMMON.

06:48.925 --> 06:50.860
>> John: OKAY, NO, RUSH.

06:50.927 --> 06:51.828
JUST NO.

06:51.895 --> 06:53.763
NO TO YOU CLAIMING COVID‐19 GOT

06:53.830 --> 06:55.265
ITS NAME BECAUSE IT WAS THE

06:55.331 --> 06:56.666
"19TH CORONAVIRUS" ‐‐ THAT'S NOT

06:56.733 --> 06:57.667
TRUE, IT'S CALLED THAT BECAUSE

06:57.734 --> 07:00.370
IT WAS FIRST IDENTIFIED IN 2019,

07:00.437 --> 07:01.971
YOU GIGANTIC POTATO.

07:02.038 --> 07:03.706
BUT ALSO, NO TO THE VIRUS BEING

07:03.773 --> 07:05.108
THE "COMMON COLD."

07:05.175 --> 07:06.876
NO TO THIS BEING "NOT UNCOMMON."

07:06.943 --> 07:08.545
NO TO YOUR GOLD MICROPHONE.

07:08.611 --> 07:09.579
NO TO YOUR BROWSER BEING OPENED

07:09.646 --> 07:10.880
TO "THE DRUDGE REPORT."

07:10.947 --> 07:12.682
NO TO YOUR LOGO THAT LOOKS LIKE

07:12.749 --> 07:13.616
TWO PAIRS OF BREASTS WHO ARE IN

07:13.683 --> 07:14.818
A FIGHT.

07:14.884 --> 07:17.454
NO TO THE MYSTERIOUS CAN ON YOUR

07:17.520 --> 07:18.721
DESK, WHICH I CAN ONLY ASSUME IS

07:18.788 --> 07:19.689
PAM ORIGINAL COOKING SPRAY.

07:19.756 --> 07:20.790
BUT MOST OF ALL, NO TO YOUR

07:20.857 --> 07:22.492
STUPID QUARANTINE BEARD.

07:22.559 --> 07:24.127
YOU LOOK LIKE IF SANTA WAS

07:24.194 --> 07:25.428
ME‐TOOED, KICKED OUT OF THE

07:25.495 --> 07:28.598
NORTH POLE, AND FORCED TO MOVE

07:28.665 --> 07:29.532
TO A CONDO IN TAMPA WITH

07:29.599 --> 07:31.134
ALL‐LINOLEUM FLOORS.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.769
I HATE IT!

07:32.836 --> 07:34.070
THE PROBLEM IS, MANY IN

07:34.137 --> 07:35.438
CONSERVATIVE MEDIA HAVE FOUND IT

07:35.505 --> 07:36.806
EASY TO FOLD THIS VIRUS INTO

07:36.873 --> 07:37.774
NARRATIVES THEY'VE BEEN

07:37.841 --> 07:38.741
CAREFULLY BUILDING UP FOR

07:38.808 --> 07:39.943
DECADES.

07:40.009 --> 07:41.911
LIMBAUGH HAS SPENT YEARS PUSHING

07:41.978 --> 07:43.379
HIS "FOUR CORNERS OF DECEIT,"

07:43.446 --> 07:44.914
WHICH CONSIST OF GOVERNMENT,

07:44.981 --> 07:46.115
ACADEMIA, SCIENCE, AND THE

07:46.182 --> 07:47.484
MEDIA, WHICH UNFORTUNATELY

07:47.550 --> 07:49.219
HAPPEN TO BE THE FOUR MOST

07:49.285 --> 07:50.487
IMPORTANT GROUPS TO LISTEN TO

07:50.553 --> 07:52.155
DURING A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS.

07:52.222 --> 07:54.824
AND I UNDERSTAND WHY HE'D SOW

07:54.891 --> 07:56.392
THAT DOUBT ‐‐ IF YOU ESTABLISH

07:56.459 --> 07:58.094
YOUR SHOW AS THE SOLE OUTLET

07:58.161 --> 07:59.095
WORTH TRUSTING, THAT GIVES YOU

07:59.162 --> 08:00.797
A LOT OF POWER.

08:00.864 --> 08:01.664
AND HE'S NOT ALONE IN UTILIZING

08:01.731 --> 08:03.500
THAT TECHNIQUE.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.468
FOX NEWS'S RECURRENT PITCH TO

08:05.535 --> 08:07.537
ITS AUDIENCE HAS BEEN THAT IT

08:07.604 --> 08:10.840
WILL TELL YOU THE TRUE STORY

08:10.907 --> 08:12.108
THAT ELITES AND THE MAINSTREAM

08:12.175 --> 08:13.042
MEDIA ARE TRYING TO HIDE.

08:13.109 --> 08:14.043
AND THAT'S HOW SOME OF THEIR

08:14.110 --> 08:15.178
HOSTS PLAYED THE VIRUS

08:15.245 --> 08:16.980
INITIALLY ‐‐ AS A HYSTERICAL

08:17.046 --> 08:18.448
ATTACK BY THE MEDIA TO DERAIL

08:18.515 --> 08:20.083
THE PRESIDENT, WITH SEGMENTS

08:20.149 --> 08:21.818
TITLED "CORONAVIRUS HYSTERIA,"

08:21.885 --> 08:22.719
"LIBERAL MEDIA HOAX BACKFIRES,"

08:22.785 --> 08:23.419
AND "TRUMP CONFRONTS

08:23.486 --> 08:25.555
THE PANIC PUSHERS."

08:25.622 --> 08:27.524
AND WHEN PEOPLE STARTED DYING,

08:27.590 --> 08:28.658
AND THAT ARGUMENT BECAME HARDER

08:28.725 --> 08:31.461
TO SELL, THE NETWORK SEEMED TO

08:31.528 --> 08:32.662
PIVOT FROM TRYING TO DOWNPLAY

08:32.729 --> 08:33.630
THE WARNINGS TO DOWNPLAYING

08:33.696 --> 08:35.231
THE DEATHS.

08:35.298 --> 08:37.233
>> TO DATE, THANKFULLY ZERO

08:37.300 --> 08:38.635
PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES OF

08:38.701 --> 08:39.168
AMERICA HAVE DIED FROM THE

08:39.235 --> 08:39.702
CORONAVIRUS.

08:39.769 --> 08:40.937
ZERO.

08:41.004 --> 08:42.906
>> WE HAVE SIX DEATHS FROM

08:42.972 --> 08:44.674
THE CORONAVIRUS ‐‐ 18,000 DEATHS

08:44.741 --> 08:45.608
FROM THE FLU.

08:45.675 --> 08:48.611
>> NINE PEOPLE HAVE DIED!

08:48.678 --> 08:50.547
THAT'S TRAGIC BUT IT'S TEENY!

08:50.613 --> 08:52.181
>> 22 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED.

08:52.248 --> 08:54.250
THOSE NUMBERS PALE IN COMPARISON

08:54.317 --> 08:56.119
TO THE NUMBER OF FLU CASES OVER

08:56.185 --> 09:03.626
THIS FLU SEASON.

09:03.693 --> 09:05.094
>> AN ESTIMATED 60,000 AMERICANS

09:05.161 --> 09:07.997
WILL DIE FROM THE CORONAVIRUS.

09:08.064 --> 09:11.134
ACCORDING TO THE CDC, 61,000

09:11.200 --> 09:11.935
AMERICANS DIED OF THE ANNUAL

09:12.001 --> 09:12.135
FLU.

09:12.201 --> 09:13.202
>> THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS,

09:13.269 --> 09:14.137
WE HAVE PEOPLE DYING ‐‐ 45,000

09:14.203 --> 09:15.405
PEOPLE A YEAR DIE FROM

09:15.471 --> 09:17.073
AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENTS, 480,000

09:17.140 --> 09:18.975
FROM CIGARETTES, 360,000 A YEAR

09:19.042 --> 09:19.542
FROM SWIMMING POOLS, BUT WE

09:19.609 --> 09:21.077
DON'T SHUT THE COUNTRY DOWN

09:21.144 --> 09:23.046
FOR THAT.

09:23.112 --> 09:23.813
>> John: OH, THANKS,

09:23.880 --> 09:25.214
NOT‐A‐MEDICAL‐DOCTOR PHIL!

09:25.281 --> 09:26.816
QUICK THING THERE: THE ANNUAL

09:26.883 --> 09:28.484
U.S. DEATH TOLL FROM SWIMMING

09:28.551 --> 09:29.752
POOLS ISN'T ACTUALLY 360,000.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.187
THEY'RE NOT KILLING ALMOST

09:31.254 --> 09:32.989
A CLEVELAND EVERY YEAR.

09:33.056 --> 09:34.457
THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DROWNINGS,

09:34.524 --> 09:36.259
PERIOD, IS AROUND 4,000.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.561
ALSO, IF SWIMMING POOLS WERE

09:38.628 --> 09:40.430
KILLING 360,000 PEOPLE A YEAR ‐‐

09:40.496 --> 09:41.831
AND YOU COULD CONTRACT A

09:41.898 --> 09:42.899
SWIMMING POOL ON A TRIP TO THE

09:42.966 --> 09:44.567
GROCERY STORE ‐‐ WE MIGHT WANT

09:44.634 --> 09:45.902
TO THINK ABOUT SHUTTING THEM

09:45.969 --> 09:47.270
DOWN UNTIL WE WORKED OUT WHAT

09:47.337 --> 09:48.871
THE FUCK WAS GOING ON.

09:48.938 --> 09:50.506
AND LOOK: A LOT OF PEOPLE

09:50.573 --> 09:52.008
UNDERESTIMATED THE DANGER OF

09:52.075 --> 09:54.210
THIS VIRUS EARLY ON.

09:54.277 --> 09:56.446
BUT FOX WAS STILL DOING IT, NOT

09:56.512 --> 09:57.914
JUST AS THE DEATH TOLL MOUNTED,

09:57.981 --> 09:59.816
BUT EVEN AS, BEHIND THE SCENES,

09:59.882 --> 10:00.617
THEIR OWN COMPANY WAS SUSPENDING

10:00.683 --> 10:02.852
NON‐ESSENTIAL BUSINESS TRAVEL,

10:02.919 --> 10:04.420
AND ENCOURAGING EMPLOYEES TO

10:04.487 --> 10:06.456
CANCEL ALL IN‐PERSON MEETINGS

10:06.522 --> 10:08.691
AND SUMMITS, AND CONDUCT

10:08.758 --> 10:10.526
BUSINESS VIA SKYPE OR BY PHONE.

10:10.593 --> 10:11.961
BECAUSE, AND THIS IS TRUE: THEY

10:12.028 --> 10:13.930
ONLY PRETEND TO BELIEVE THESE

10:13.997 --> 10:15.231
THINGS ON TELEVISION FOR MONEY.

10:15.298 --> 10:16.733
AND THE PROBLEM IS, OUR CURRENT

10:16.799 --> 10:18.801
PRESIDENT ISN'T JUST THE SUBJECT

10:18.868 --> 10:20.837
OF THIS MISINFORMATION ‐‐ HE IS,

10:20.903 --> 10:23.306
AS WE ALL KNOW, ALSO THE TARGET

10:23.373 --> 10:25.608
OF IT, OFTEN PULLING HIS TALKING

10:25.675 --> 10:26.676
POINTS DIRECTLY FROM WHAT HE

10:26.743 --> 10:27.577
SEES.

10:27.644 --> 10:29.045
LATE LAST MONTH, A POPULAR

10:29.112 --> 10:30.480
CONSERVATIVE NARRATIVE BECAME

10:30.546 --> 10:31.814
THAT IT WAS TIME TO REOPEN THE

10:31.881 --> 10:33.683
ECONOMY, AND FOX'S STEVE HILTON

10:33.750 --> 10:36.386
ENCAPSULATED IT LIKE THIS:

10:36.452 --> 10:37.854
>> YOU KNOW THAT FAMOUS PHRASE?

10:37.920 --> 10:38.921
THE CURE IS WORSE THAN THE

10:38.988 --> 10:39.922
DISEASE.

10:39.989 --> 10:42.225
THAT IS EXACTLY THE TERRITORY

10:42.291 --> 10:43.526
WE ARE HURTLING TOWARDS.

10:43.593 --> 10:45.428
>> John: NOW, I'M PRETTY SURE

10:45.495 --> 10:47.096
TRUMP SAW THAT, BECAUSE JUST

10:47.163 --> 10:48.464
A COUPLE OF HOURS AFTER THAT

10:48.531 --> 10:49.532
SEGMENT AIRED, HE TWEETED,

10:49.599 --> 10:52.001
"WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE

10:52.068 --> 10:53.236
THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF," AND

10:53.302 --> 10:54.671
THE NEXT DAY, COULDN'T SEEM TO

10:54.737 --> 10:55.638
STOP SAYING IT:

10:55.705 --> 10:57.674
>> WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE

10:57.740 --> 10:59.008
WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF.

10:59.075 --> 10:59.942
WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THE CURE

11:00.009 --> 11:02.345
BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM.

11:02.412 --> 11:02.979
THAT'S WHY I TALK ABOUT THE CURE

11:03.046 --> 11:03.913
BEING WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM.

11:03.980 --> 11:05.415
WE CAN'T HAVE THE CURE BE WORSE

11:05.481 --> 11:06.649
THAN THE PROBLEM.

11:06.716 --> 11:07.917
WHEN I SAY THE CURE ‐‐

11:07.984 --> 11:09.318
AND THE CURE CAN BE WORSE THAN

11:09.385 --> 11:11.754
THE PROBLEM ITSELF, RIGHT?

11:11.821 --> 11:12.755
THAT'S WHAT I ‐‐ WE CAN'T LET

11:12.822 --> 11:13.256
THAT HAPPEN.

11:13.322 --> 11:15.124
>> John: IT'S PRETTY DEPRESSING

11:15.191 --> 11:16.059
TO SEE THE PRESIDENT JUST

11:16.125 --> 11:17.060
PARROTING WHAT HE HEARD ON TV

11:17.126 --> 11:18.327
THE NIGHT BEFORE.

11:18.394 --> 11:19.996
AND IF HE'S GOING TO DO THAT,

11:20.063 --> 11:21.030
THE VERY LEAST HE COULD DO IS

11:21.097 --> 11:21.931
PICK A BETTER SHOW THAN

11:21.998 --> 11:22.899
STEVE HILTON'S

11:22.965 --> 11:24.867
"THE NEXT REVOLUTION."

11:24.934 --> 11:26.102
WHY NOT GO WITH

11:26.169 --> 11:27.637
"BELOW DECK SAILING YACHT?"

11:27.704 --> 11:28.871
THAT WAY, WE'D GET TO HEAR THE

11:28.938 --> 11:30.206
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

11:30.273 --> 11:31.474
TELL US ABOUT HOW ADAM THE CHEF

11:31.541 --> 11:33.443
IS A TEASE, AND HOW MADISON

11:33.509 --> 11:34.977
NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND HER ROLE IN

11:35.044 --> 11:35.878
THE INTERIOR PECKING ORDER AND

11:35.945 --> 11:37.280
START LISTENING TO HER CHIEF

11:37.346 --> 11:38.848
STEW, BECAUSE JENNA DOES NOT

11:38.915 --> 11:39.582
NEED TO TAKE HER SHIT.

11:39.649 --> 11:41.484
YES, IT WOULDN'T BE HELPFUL

11:41.551 --> 11:43.119
DURING A PANDEMIC, BUT AT LEAST

11:43.186 --> 11:44.220
IT WOULDN'T BE ACTIVELY HARMFUL.

11:44.287 --> 11:46.789
THAT'S WHAT'S INFURIATING.

11:46.856 --> 11:49.459
EVEN THOUGH TRUMP HAS ACCESS

11:49.525 --> 11:50.626
TO THE COUNTRY'S TOP EXPERTS,

11:50.693 --> 11:51.461
HE'S STILL GETTING ADVICE FROM

11:51.527 --> 11:52.795
WATCHING TV.

11:52.862 --> 11:55.631
AND NOT JUST ON TALKING

11:55.698 --> 11:56.733
POINTS, BUT ON MEDICINE.

11:56.799 --> 11:57.600
TAKE HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE.

11:57.667 --> 11:58.801
IT'S A DRUG COMMONLY USED

11:58.868 --> 12:00.136
FOR CONDITIONS LIKE

12:00.203 --> 12:01.337
RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND LUPUS.

12:01.404 --> 12:03.172
AND IT GOT A HUGE BOOST IN

12:03.239 --> 12:04.340
MID‐MARCH AS A POTENTIAL

12:04.407 --> 12:05.274
CORONAVIRUS TREATMENT FROM

12:05.341 --> 12:08.478
TUCKER CARLSON'S SHOW.

12:08.544 --> 12:10.179
>> EARLY EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT

12:10.246 --> 12:11.948
CHLOROQUINE ‐‐ THAT'S A CHEAP

12:12.014 --> 12:13.249
ANTIMALARIA DRUG ‐‐ MAY BE

12:13.316 --> 12:14.016
EFFECTIVE IN TREATING

12:14.083 --> 12:15.518
CORONAVIRUS.

12:15.585 --> 12:16.886
GREGORY RIGANO IS AN ADVISER AT

12:16.953 --> 12:18.321
THE STANFORD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL

12:18.387 --> 12:18.921
OF MEDICINE, AND HE JOINS US

12:18.988 --> 12:19.722
TONIGHT.

12:19.789 --> 12:21.524
>> A WELL‐CONTROLLED,

12:21.591 --> 12:23.259
PEER‐REVIEWED STUDY CARRIED OUT

12:23.326 --> 12:25.228
BY THE MOST EMINENT INFECTIOUS

12:25.294 --> 12:27.029
DISEASE SPECIALIST IN THE WORLD

12:27.096 --> 12:29.132
SHOWED A 100% CURE RATE AGAINST

12:29.198 --> 12:30.299
CORONAVIRUS.

12:30.366 --> 12:32.168
>> I ONLY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE

12:32.235 --> 12:33.136
TELLING ME, BUT I DO KNOW IT'S

12:33.202 --> 12:34.437
VERY UNUSUAL FOR A STUDY OF

12:34.504 --> 12:36.038
ANYTHING TO PRODUCE RESULTS OF

12:36.105 --> 12:38.241
100%.

12:38.307 --> 12:39.275
I MEAN, THAT'S REMARKABLE,

12:39.342 --> 12:39.909
ISN'T IT?

12:39.976 --> 12:42.912
OR AM I MISSING SOMETHING?

12:42.979 --> 12:44.781
>> John: OH, YOU'RE VERY MUCH

12:44.847 --> 12:45.481
MISSING SOMETHING, TUCKER.

12:45.548 --> 12:46.549
FOR STARTERS, THAT MAN'S ROLE

12:46.616 --> 12:48.317
AS AN ADVISOR TO STANFORD

12:48.384 --> 12:49.819
UNIVERSITY WAS NEWS TO STANFORD,

12:49.886 --> 12:51.254
WHO HAVE SINCE CLARIFIED:

12:51.320 --> 12:52.922
"GREGORY RIGANO IS NOT AN

12:52.989 --> 12:54.657
ADVISOR WITH THEIR SCHOOL OF

12:54.724 --> 12:56.659
MEDICINE AND NO ONE AT STANFORD

12:56.726 --> 12:57.760
WAS INVOLVED IN THE STUDY."

12:57.827 --> 12:59.462
AS FOR THAT 100% CURE RATE,

12:59.529 --> 13:01.631
YOU SHOULD KNOW THEY OBTAINED

13:01.697 --> 13:03.466
THAT BY OMITTING THREE PATIENTS

13:03.533 --> 13:05.067
WHO WERE TRANSFERRED TO AN ICU,

13:05.134 --> 13:09.272
AND ONE PATIENT WHO DIED.

13:09.338 --> 13:10.239
AND IT IS VERY EASY TO HAVE A

13:10.306 --> 13:11.440
100% SUCCESS RATE IF YOU JUST

13:11.507 --> 13:12.909
LEAVE OUT ANY RESULT THAT WASN'T

13:12.975 --> 13:13.743
A SUCCESS.

13:13.810 --> 13:15.678
NEVERTHELESS, THE VERY NEXT DAY,

13:15.745 --> 13:17.146
TRUMP PUBLICLY MENTIONED

13:17.213 --> 13:18.147
HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE

13:18.214 --> 13:19.882
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

13:19.949 --> 13:21.284
AND HAS SINCE BROUGHT IT UP

13:21.350 --> 13:22.385
CONSTANTLY, WITH VARYING DEGREES

13:22.451 --> 13:23.753
OF RECKLESSNESS.

13:23.820 --> 13:26.689
>> I JUST HOPE THAT

13:26.756 --> 13:29.859
HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE WINS.

13:29.926 --> 13:31.060
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?

13:31.127 --> 13:31.627
I'LL SAY IT AGAIN:

13:31.694 --> 13:33.029
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?

13:33.095 --> 13:34.030
TAKE IT.

13:34.096 --> 13:34.730
I REALLY THINK THEY SHOULD

13:34.797 --> 13:35.631
TAKE IT.

13:35.698 --> 13:36.566
>> John: "WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO

13:36.632 --> 13:37.099
LOSE?

13:37.166 --> 13:38.167
TAKE IT!"

13:38.234 --> 13:40.002
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:40.069 --> 13:41.704
YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT, NOT A MEAN

13:41.771 --> 13:42.738
SOPHOMORE TRYING TO PRESSURE ME

13:42.805 --> 13:44.207
INTO DOING ADDERALL.

13:44.273 --> 13:45.842
ALSO, IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU HAVE

13:45.908 --> 13:47.677
TO LOSE, POSSIBLY QUITE A BIT,

13:47.743 --> 13:50.179
AS DOCTORS ARE WARNING THE DRUG

13:50.246 --> 13:51.881
CAN TRIGGER ARRHYTHMIA, WHICH

13:51.948 --> 13:52.849
CAN LEAD TO A FATAL HEART ATTACK

13:52.915 --> 13:54.984
IN CERTAIN PATIENTS.

13:55.051 --> 13:57.520
AND THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THIS

13:57.587 --> 13:58.588
DRUG SHOULDN'T BE STUDIED ‐‐ IT

13:58.654 --> 14:00.656
SHOULD, AND IT IS.

14:00.723 --> 14:02.258
BUT THE FEEDBACK LOOP BETWEEN

14:02.325 --> 14:04.293
FOX AND TRUMP HAS RUN WAY AHEAD

14:04.360 --> 14:07.263
OF THE SCIENCE HERE;

14:07.330 --> 14:09.365
IN JUST ONE TWO‐WEEK PERIOD,

14:09.432 --> 14:10.499
FOX PERSONALITIES AND THEIR

14:10.566 --> 14:11.734
GUESTS MADE CLAIMS PROMOTING

14:11.801 --> 14:13.603
HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE NEARLY

14:13.669 --> 14:15.404
300 TIMES, WITH LAURA INGRAHAM

14:15.471 --> 14:16.639
EVEN VISITING TRUMP AT

14:16.706 --> 14:17.840
THE WHITE HOUSE EARLIER THIS

14:17.907 --> 14:19.842
MONTH TO ADVOCATE FOR THE DRUG.

14:19.909 --> 14:21.577
THANKS TO THIS MEDIA FRENZY,

14:21.644 --> 14:23.379
THE EFFICACY OF THIS DRUG ‐‐

14:23.446 --> 14:25.481
WHICH SHOULD BE A SCIENTIFIC

14:25.548 --> 14:27.083
ISSUE ‐‐ HAS BECOME A POLITICAL

14:27.149 --> 14:28.451
ONE.

14:28.517 --> 14:29.986
ANYONE SAYING THEY WANT MORE

14:30.052 --> 14:31.687
COMPREHENSIVE STUDIES CAN BE

14:31.754 --> 14:33.089
DISMISSED BY THE RIGHT AS

14:33.155 --> 14:34.056
A TRUMP HATER.

14:34.123 --> 14:35.658
AND IF YOU ARGUE WE SHOULDN'T

14:35.725 --> 14:36.659
MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON

14:36.726 --> 14:38.027
ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE,

14:38.094 --> 14:39.128
RUSH LIMBAUGH HAS A READY

14:39.195 --> 14:40.496
RESPONSE.

14:40.563 --> 14:41.130
>> ANECDOTALLY, IT'S BEEN

14:41.197 --> 14:42.298
POSITIVE.

14:42.365 --> 14:44.400
ANECDOTAL?

14:44.467 --> 14:45.701
IT JUST MEANS IT HASN'T BEEN

14:45.768 --> 14:46.669
SCIENTIFICALLY TESTED IN

14:46.736 --> 14:47.470
MASS NUMBERS, BUT IT MEANS

14:47.536 --> 14:49.839
IT'S WORKING.

14:49.906 --> 14:50.873
ANECDOTALLY, I ARRIVED AT WORK

14:50.940 --> 14:52.808
TODAY.

14:52.875 --> 14:55.978
IT MEANS IT HAPPENED.

14:56.045 --> 14:57.446
>> John: RIGHT, ANECDOTALLY, YOU

14:57.513 --> 14:58.547
ARRIVED AT WORK TODAY, RUSH.

14:58.614 --> 15:00.283
BUT THAT ALONE DOESN'T MEAN THAT

15:00.349 --> 15:03.085
EVERYONE ARRIVED AT WORK TODAY,

15:03.152 --> 15:03.853
OR EVEN MOST PEOPLE ARRIVED

15:03.920 --> 15:06.389
AT WORK TODAY.

15:06.455 --> 15:08.624
IT JUST MEANS THAT YOU DID.

15:08.691 --> 15:09.525
THERE IS A PROCESS FOR KNOWING

15:09.592 --> 15:10.526
WHETHER A SCIENTIFIC CLAIM IS

15:10.593 --> 15:11.460
TRUE, AND IT INVOLVES TESTING

15:11.527 --> 15:12.561
AND OBSERVING RESULTS IN A

15:12.628 --> 15:13.596
CONTROLLED SETTING, RATHER THAN

15:13.663 --> 15:14.664
YELLING YOUR THOUGHTS

15:14.730 --> 15:15.631
CONFIDENTLY INTO C‐3PO'S

15:15.698 --> 15:20.002
PENIS.

15:20.069 --> 15:21.804
AND I KNOW IT IS EASY TO WRITE

15:21.871 --> 15:23.005
OFF LIMBAUGH AS A RIGHT‐WING

15:23.072 --> 15:24.340
BLOWHARD, BUT THE REALITY IS,

15:24.407 --> 15:25.908
HE DRAWS OVER 15 MILLION

15:25.975 --> 15:27.109
LISTENERS A WEEK, AMONG THE MOST

15:27.176 --> 15:28.177
LOYAL OF WHOM IS THE PRESIDENT,

15:28.244 --> 15:29.679
WHO REPORTEDLY CONSIDERS

15:29.745 --> 15:31.280
LIMBAUGH A REAL‐TIME METRIC OF

15:31.347 --> 15:32.581
HOW HIS DECISIONS ARE PLAYING

15:32.648 --> 15:34.550
WITH HIS SUPPORTERS.

15:34.617 --> 15:36.652
AND ALL THIS TIME, EXISTING

15:36.719 --> 15:38.421
PATIENTS WITH CONDITIONS LIKE

15:38.487 --> 15:39.822
LUPUS, WHO'VE BEEN TAKING

15:39.889 --> 15:40.957
HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE FOR YEARS,

15:41.023 --> 15:42.692
ARE NOW STRUGGLING TO GET IT.

15:42.758 --> 15:44.193
ONE LARGE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER

15:44.260 --> 15:45.461
EVEN WROTE TO LUPUS PATIENTS,

15:45.528 --> 15:47.496
TELLING THEM THAT, DUE TO

15:47.563 --> 15:49.432
A WORLDWIDE SHORTAGE, IT WON'T

15:49.498 --> 15:50.433
REFILL THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS,

15:50.499 --> 15:51.534
SAYING, "THANK YOU FOR THE

15:51.600 --> 15:54.937
SACRIFICE YOU WILL BE MAKING."

15:55.004 --> 15:57.206
AND LOOK: I'D LIKE NOTHING MORE

15:57.273 --> 15:57.773
THAN IF THIS WAS, SOMEHOW,

15:57.840 --> 15:59.475
A MIRACLE CURE.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.177
BUT I CAN'T SAY IT IS, AND

16:01.243 --> 16:02.511
I CAN'T SAY IT ISN'T, BECAUSE

16:02.578 --> 16:05.448
IT'S STILL BEING TESTED,

16:05.514 --> 16:06.349
AND I'M NOT A FUCKING DOCTOR!

16:06.415 --> 16:06.949
IT MIGHT!

16:07.016 --> 16:08.851
IT COULD!

16:08.918 --> 16:12.388
IT'S TOO SOON TO SAY!

16:12.455 --> 16:13.389
THE PROBLEM IS, MIGHT AND COULD

16:13.456 --> 16:15.658
AREN'T REALLY WORDS THAT GRAB AN

16:15.725 --> 16:16.759
AUDIENCE ‐‐ THAT IS WHY

16:16.826 --> 16:17.793
CABLE NEWS OFTEN TRAFFICS IN

16:17.860 --> 16:18.961
BRIGHT, PRIMARY COLORS AND

16:19.028 --> 16:20.730
EASY STORYLINES.

16:20.796 --> 16:22.164
ME TELLING YOU WE HAVE TO WAIT

16:22.231 --> 16:24.700
FOR RESULTS ISN'T SATISFYING TO

16:24.767 --> 16:26.635
HEAR OR TO WATCH.

16:26.702 --> 16:28.537
AND THROUGHOUT THIS CRISIS, FOX

16:28.604 --> 16:30.106
HAS CONSTANTLY PRESENTED SIMPLE

16:30.172 --> 16:31.374
SOLUTIONS TO COMPLEX PROBLEMS.

16:31.440 --> 16:33.209
JUST WATCH SEAN HANNITY

16:33.275 --> 16:34.777
FORMULATE A PLAN ‐‐ SEEMINGLY IN

16:34.844 --> 16:37.546
REAL TIME ‐‐ FOR RESUMING

16:37.613 --> 16:38.948
BASEBALL GAMES BY TESTING EVERY

16:39.015 --> 16:39.648
PERSON IN ATTENDANCE AND HAVING

16:39.715 --> 16:41.751
THEM WEAR PPE.

16:41.817 --> 16:43.919
>> IF IT'S MY CHOICE, AND I HAVE

16:43.986 --> 16:46.822
TO WEAR GLOVES, A MASK ‐‐ OKAY,

16:46.889 --> 16:47.957
I'LL WEAR IT.

16:48.024 --> 16:49.492
I'D RATHER GO AND WEAR IT.

16:49.558 --> 16:51.327
IF EVERYONE ELSE IS WEARING IT,

16:51.394 --> 16:52.528
WE CAN SUCK IT UP FOR A COUPLE

16:52.595 --> 16:55.231
MONTHS UNTIL THINGS HAVE PASSED.

16:55.297 --> 16:56.665
PROBABLY CAN'T EAT POPCORN

16:56.732 --> 16:58.067
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR

16:58.134 --> 16:58.901
MASK OFF THE WHOLE TIME, BUT YOU

16:58.968 --> 17:00.836
PROBABLY COULD EAT A HOT DOG.

17:00.903 --> 17:02.671
YOU OPEN UP YOUR RESPIRATOR,

17:02.738 --> 17:04.006
TAKE A BITE, AND YOU CHEW IT

17:04.073 --> 17:05.841
UNDER YOUR MASK.

17:05.908 --> 17:07.143
I HAVE TO DRINK MY BEER IF I'M

17:07.209 --> 17:08.911
AT A GAME, SO IF I HAVE TO USE

17:08.978 --> 17:10.012
A STRAW AND SLIP IT IN, I'D DO

17:10.079 --> 17:11.147
THAT.

17:11.213 --> 17:12.615
I WOULD RATHER HAVE MY

17:12.681 --> 17:15.251
TEMPERATURE TAKEN, DRINK BEER

17:15.317 --> 17:16.519
FROM A STRAW, EAT A HOT DOG BY

17:16.585 --> 17:17.153
GOING LIKE THIS AND CHEWING IT

17:17.219 --> 17:18.087
IN A MASK THAN NOT GO AT ALL.

17:18.154 --> 17:18.721
THAT'S MY DECISION,

17:18.788 --> 17:20.756
YOU MAKE YOURS.

17:20.823 --> 17:25.594
NOW I'M PRO CHOICE.

17:25.661 --> 17:26.929
>> John: ARE YOU REALLY?

17:26.996 --> 17:27.830
SETTING ASIDE THE

17:27.897 --> 17:28.998
"PRO CHOICE" LINE ‐‐ YOU'RE

17:29.065 --> 17:29.899
RIGHT, SEAN, YOUR BODY,

17:29.965 --> 17:31.200
YOUR CHOICE ‐‐ I DON'T SEE

17:31.267 --> 17:31.901
A SINGLE FLAW IN THAT.

17:31.967 --> 17:33.269
OBVIOUSLY, YOU COULDN'T EAT

17:33.335 --> 17:33.803
POPCORN.

17:33.869 --> 17:34.770
BUT YOU COULD DEFINITELY GET

17:34.837 --> 17:35.704
A HOT DOG IN YOUR MOUTH BEFORE

17:35.771 --> 17:36.705
THE VIRUS COULD SNEAK IN THERE.

17:36.772 --> 17:38.240
THAT'S JUST SCIENCE.

17:38.307 --> 17:39.642
ANECDOTALLY, I KNOW A GUY WHO

17:39.708 --> 17:40.943
ATE A HOT DOG ONCE AND DIDN'T

17:41.010 --> 17:42.478
GET CORONAVIRUS, SO THAT

17:42.545 --> 17:44.013
ABSOLUTELY CHECKS OUT.

17:44.080 --> 17:45.214
AND WHILE THAT'S ALMOST

17:45.281 --> 17:48.484
INCOMPREHENSIBLY STUPID,

17:48.551 --> 17:50.519
YOU CAN'T DENY IT'S GOOD TV.

17:50.586 --> 17:51.954
THE ISSUE IS THAT THE SKILLS

17:52.021 --> 17:53.989
REQUIRED TO PRODUCE TV AND

17:54.056 --> 17:55.858
TO GOVERN ARE VERY DIFFERENT.

17:55.925 --> 17:56.859
AND UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE

17:56.926 --> 17:58.094
A PRESIDENT WHO DOESN'T SEEM TO

17:58.160 --> 17:59.462
KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

17:59.528 --> 18:01.063
AT THE START OF HIS PRESIDENCY,

18:01.130 --> 18:03.165
HE FAMOUSLY TOLD TOP AIDES TO

18:03.232 --> 18:04.700
THINK OF EACH PRESIDENTIAL DAY

18:04.767 --> 18:07.269
LIKE AN EPISODE OF A TELEVISION

18:07.336 --> 18:07.837
SHOW IN WHICH HE VANQUISHES

18:07.903 --> 18:10.272
RIVALS.

18:10.339 --> 18:10.940
SO WE HAVE A NETWORK AND

18:11.006 --> 18:12.241
A PRESIDENT WHO THRIVE ON

18:12.308 --> 18:13.843
DIVISION, FEEDING ON ONE

18:13.909 --> 18:15.177
ANOTHER, AT A TIME WHEN WE

18:15.244 --> 18:16.946
DESPERATELY NEED A UNIFIED

18:17.012 --> 18:20.049
RESPONSE TO A PUBLIC HEALTH

18:20.116 --> 18:20.282
CRISIS.

18:20.349 --> 18:21.450
AND ALL THAT BRINGS US BACK TO

18:21.517 --> 18:22.251
THE PROTESTS WE DISCUSSED

18:22.318 --> 18:23.719
EARLIER.

18:23.786 --> 18:25.488
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN TO

18:25.554 --> 18:27.056
THE STREETS THIS WEEK, FUELED BY

18:27.123 --> 18:30.126
THE KIND OF MISINFORMATION

18:30.192 --> 18:31.560
THAT IS RAMPANT IN RIGHT‐WING

18:31.627 --> 18:33.462
MEDIA ‐‐ THE SAME RIGHT‐WING

18:33.529 --> 18:34.663
MEDIA WHICH THEN EAGERLY COVERED

18:34.730 --> 18:38.367
THE PROTESTS THAT THEY HELPED

18:38.434 --> 18:39.168
CREATE, LIKE THIS.

18:39.235 --> 18:40.202
>> PROTESTS POPPING UP ALL

18:40.269 --> 18:41.570
ACROSS AMERICA AS SOME FED UP

18:41.637 --> 18:44.006
FOLKS ARE DEMANDING AN END TO

18:44.073 --> 18:45.141
STAY‐AT‐HOME ORDERS.

18:45.207 --> 18:46.208
>> THEY GOT IN FRONT OF THE

18:46.275 --> 18:46.976
GOVERNOR'S RESIDENCE IN

18:47.042 --> 18:48.477
ST. PAUL YESTERDAY.

18:48.544 --> 18:49.845
THEY REFERENCED THINGS LIKE

18:49.912 --> 18:50.613
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S STATEMENT THAT

18:50.679 --> 18:51.514
"THE CURE CANNOT BE WORSE THAN

18:51.580 --> 18:52.882
THE DISEASE."

18:52.948 --> 18:55.017
>> John: EXCEPT "THE CURE CAN'T

18:55.084 --> 18:56.418
BE WORSE THAN THE DISEASE" ISN'T

18:56.485 --> 18:57.620
TRUMP'S STATEMENT; HE STOLE THAT

18:57.686 --> 18:58.621
PHRASE FROM YOU GUYS!

18:58.687 --> 19:00.122
YOU SHOULDN'T BE CREDITING HIM

19:00.189 --> 19:01.056
WITH THAT, YOU SHOULD BE

19:01.123 --> 19:02.024
CHARGING HIM WITH COPYRIGHT

19:02.091 --> 19:04.493
INFRINGEMENT.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.928
AND LIKE CLOCKWORK, TRUMP ‐‐

19:05.995 --> 19:07.129
JUST A FEW MINUTES AFTER THAT

19:07.196 --> 19:09.165
SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTED GROUPS LIKE

19:09.231 --> 19:11.467
"LIBERATE MINNESOTA" ‐‐ TWEETED

19:11.534 --> 19:13.035
OUT, "LIBERATE MINNESOTA,"

19:13.102 --> 19:14.837
FOLLOWED BY "LIBERATE MICHIGAN,"

19:14.904 --> 19:16.539
AND THEN, "LIBERATE VIRGINIA."

19:16.605 --> 19:17.940
AND ALL OF THIS IS LEGITIMATELY

19:18.007 --> 19:19.308
DANGEROUS, BECAUSE WATCHING

19:19.375 --> 19:23.245
COVERAGE LIKE THAT MIGHT

19:23.312 --> 19:24.079
CONVINCE TRUMP THAT THERE'S

19:24.146 --> 19:24.947
A SIZEABLE PORTION OF THE

19:25.014 --> 19:25.681
POPULATION THAT WANTS TO GO BACK

19:25.748 --> 19:26.815
TO WORK NO MATTER THE COST.

19:26.882 --> 19:28.083
BUT THAT'S NOT CURRENTLY

19:28.150 --> 19:33.422
THE CASE.

19:33.489 --> 19:34.423
66% OF AMERICANS SAY THEY ARE

19:34.490 --> 19:35.157
MORE CONCERNED RESTRICTIONS

19:35.224 --> 19:36.158
WILL BE LIFTED TOO QUICKLY

19:36.225 --> 19:37.092
THAN TOO SLOWLY.

19:37.159 --> 19:39.094
AND IT'S FRANKLY REMARKABLE THAT

19:39.161 --> 19:39.895
NUMBER IS SO HIGH AFTER WEEKS

19:39.962 --> 19:41.964
OF THIS BULLSHIT.

19:42.031 --> 19:45.301
AND LOOK: I GET TRUMP, FOX, AND

19:45.367 --> 19:46.402
THOSE PROTESTORS WANTING ALL OF

19:46.468 --> 19:46.769
THIS TO BE OVER.

19:46.835 --> 19:48.270
I DO, TOO.

19:48.337 --> 19:49.939
I WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO GO

19:50.005 --> 19:51.574
BACK TO WORK, AND TO GET SOME

19:51.640 --> 19:54.076
SENSE OF NORMALCY RESTORED.

19:54.143 --> 19:55.077
BUT FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH: I KNOW

19:55.144 --> 19:57.646
PEOPLE WHO'VE DIED FROM THIS

19:57.713 --> 19:59.682
I ALSO KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE

19:59.748 --> 20:00.649
TAKING HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE

20:00.716 --> 20:02.117
BECAUSE THEY THINK IT WILL GIVE

20:02.184 --> 20:03.552
THEM IMMUNITY.

20:03.619 --> 20:05.221
AND I KNOW PEOPLE WITH LUPUS WHO

26:51.226 --> 26:53.528
SMOTHERED BY HOT SAUCE AND

26:53.595 --> 26:57.833
MAPLE SYRUP.

26:57.899 --> 26:59.101
YOU DON'T ‐‐ YOU DON'T WANNA SEE

26:59.167 --> 27:00.068
ME EAT, THEN YOU MIGHT NOT WANNA

27:00.135 --> 27:00.902
BE HERE, OKAY?

27:00.969 --> 27:03.939
THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE DO.

27:04.006 --> 27:05.607
>> John: IS THAT WHAT PEOPLE DO?

27:05.674 --> 27:07.275
I GET THAT PEOPLE DO EAT, JUST

27:07.342 --> 27:08.443
NOT USUALLY AT THE SAME TIME

27:08.510 --> 27:09.945
THAT THEY'RE HOSTING A TALK SHOW

27:10.012 --> 27:11.146
AND TELLING ANYONE WATCHING TO

27:11.213 --> 27:13.815
FUCK OFF IF THEY DON'T LIKE IT.

27:13.882 --> 27:15.083
THIS ISN'T WHAT PEOPLE DO; THIS

27:15.150 --> 27:16.351
IS WHAT WENDY WILLIAMS DOES,

27:16.418 --> 27:17.886
BECAUSE WENDY WILLIAMS HAS

27:17.953 --> 27:18.954
ASCENDED TO A LEVEL OF

27:19.021 --> 27:20.422
FUCKS‐NOT‐GIVEN THAT NO HUMAN

27:20.489 --> 27:23.725
HAS EVER ACHIEVED BEFORE.

27:23.792 --> 27:24.860
I'LL BE HONEST: I WAS NEVER

27:24.926 --> 27:26.194
A REGULAR VIEWER OF

27:26.261 --> 27:26.762
"THE WENDY WILLIAMS SHOW,"

27:26.828 --> 27:28.697
BUT I'VE BECOME A BIG FAN OF

27:28.764 --> 27:30.899
"WENDY AT HOME."

27:30.966 --> 27:31.566
IT'S AN OASIS OF TRUTH

27:31.633 --> 27:34.369
IN A WORLD FULL OF LIES.

27:34.436 --> 27:35.237
IT'S A REAL PICKLE ATOP A FAKE

27:35.303 --> 27:38.473
HAMBURGER, IF YOU WILL.

27:38.540 --> 27:39.675
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S CHEERED ME

27:39.741 --> 27:43.412
UP SO MUCH TO WATCH WENDY

27:43.478 --> 27:44.413
EMBRACE THE GLORIOUS CHAOS

27:44.479 --> 27:45.647
IN HER MADCAP APARTMENT.

27:45.714 --> 27:46.381
AND I WANTED TO FIND A WAY TO

27:46.448 --> 27:47.382
REPAY HER.

27:47.449 --> 27:48.650
UNFORTUNATELY, I DON'T HAVE ANY

27:48.717 --> 27:49.217
HYPEBEAST BETTY BOOP

27:49.284 --> 27:50.752
ACCESSORIES.

27:50.819 --> 27:53.155
BUT ONCE AGAIN, IN MY TIME OF

27:53.221 --> 27:54.022
NEED, WENDY HAS PROVIDED THE

27:54.089 --> 27:55.424
ANSWER.

27:55.490 --> 27:57.826
IT CAME AFTER SHE PLAYED A CLIP

27:57.893 --> 27:59.828
OF TWO WOMEN, TINY AND SHEKINAH,

27:59.895 --> 28:00.629
WHO HAD BEEN DEFENDING

28:00.696 --> 28:02.497
BILL COSBY.

28:02.564 --> 28:03.699
>> BILL COSBY NEEDS TO STAY IN

28:03.765 --> 28:05.534
JAIL FOR ALL HIS YEARS.

28:05.600 --> 28:06.368
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THESE GIRLS

28:06.435 --> 28:09.137
ARE TALKING ABOUT.

28:09.204 --> 28:10.605
BUT I WAS TOO DISTRACTED BY

28:10.672 --> 28:12.674
TINY'S ONESIE.

28:12.741 --> 28:18.714
NORMAN, I NEED THAT IN MY LIFE.

28:18.780 --> 28:19.815
THERE ARE ONLY BUT SO MANY

28:19.881 --> 28:20.716
POOFS I HAVE.

28:20.782 --> 28:23.051
I NEED THAT ONESIE IN MY LIFE!

28:23.118 --> 28:29.157
>> John: WENDY'S RIGHT.

28:29.224 --> 28:30.158
SHE DOES DESERVE THAT

28:30.225 --> 28:30.859
ONESIE.

28:30.926 --> 28:31.993
BUT HOW WOULD YOU EVEN GO ABOUT

28:32.060 --> 28:32.861
FINDING IT FOR HER?

28:32.928 --> 28:33.795
THERE ARE NO LEADS IN THAT CLIP.

28:33.862 --> 28:34.496
AND EVEN IF YOU COULD FIND IT,

28:34.563 --> 28:34.996
LEISURE WEAR IS SOLD OUT

28:35.063 --> 28:35.831
EVERYWHERE RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE

28:39.334 --> 28:40.135
TENACIOUS RESEARCH DEPARTMENT,

28:40.202 --> 28:41.169

28:41.236 --> 28:42.671
CAN ASSEMBLE THE WORLD'S BIGGEST

28:42.738 --> 28:43.305
CAKE AND STAGE A MUSICAL IN THE

28:43.371 --> 28:44.940
MIDDLE OF TIMES SQUARE.

28:45.006 --> 28:45.607
AND WHEN YOU ASK THEM, "CAN YOU

28:45.674 --> 28:47.476
TRACK DOWN THIS STAR‐SPANGLED

28:47.542 --> 28:48.276
ONESIE FOR WENDY WILLIAMS?"

28:48.343 --> 28:51.079
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DO?

28:51.146 --> 28:52.180
FIRST, THEY FLAG THAT WENDY'S

28:52.247 --> 28:53.315
WRONG ‐‐ IT'S NOT ACTUALLY

28:53.381 --> 28:54.416
A ONESIE, IT'S A TWO‐PIECE

28:54.483 --> 28:58.754
SWEATSUIT.

28:58.820 --> 28:59.721
AND THEN ‐‐ THEN YOU KNOW WHAT

28:59.788 --> 29:04.659
THEY DO?

29:04.726 --> 29:08.130
AND THEN THEY TRACK THAT FUCKING

29:08.196 --> 29:09.030
THING DOWN.

29:09.097 --> 29:09.598
SO HERE YOU GO, WENDY.

29:09.664 --> 29:10.365
THIS SWEATSUIT IS FOR YOU.

29:10.432 --> 29:11.032
JUST TELL US WHERE TO SEND IT,

29:11.099 --> 29:12.134
