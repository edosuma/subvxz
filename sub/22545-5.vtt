SO THEY ROSE UP
FROM THEIR GRAVES

11:12.940 --> 11:14.574

OVER THE FARM.

11:14.641 --> 11:16.944
THEY USED FARMER T.'s
VERY OWN TRACTOR

11:17.010 --> 11:21.882
TO RUN HIM DOWN AND MAKE
HIM ONE OF THEIR OWN.

11:21.949 --> 11:23.851

HE STILL RETURNS

11:23.917 --> 11:26.086
TO SEEK HIS REVENGE,

WAS THE CODE NUMBERS
ON THEIR TAGS.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.476
THAT WAY HE COULD
GET INTO MR. B.'s LAB

19:36.543 --> 19:39.746
AND STEAL JONAS'S
POPCORN-ON-THE-COB PROTOTYPE.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.147
MAKES TOTAL SENSE.

19:41.214 --> 19:44.251
NEVILLE'S POPCORN TASTES
LIKE GREASY CARDBOARD.

19:44.317 --> 19:45.585
AND GETS STUCK
IN YOUR TEETH.

19:45.652 --> 19:48.087
AND REALLY NEEDS SALT.

19:48.154 --> 19:51.224
I HEARD ABOUT JONAS'S
INCREDIBLE POPCORN

19:51.291 --> 19:53.226
FROM A FORMER FARMHAND.

19:53.293 --> 19:55.262
I KNEW IT WOULD BE
THE END OF MY COMPANY

19:55.328 --> 19:56.563
ONCE IT HIT THE SHELVES.

19:56.629 --> 19:58.498
SO YOU HAD TO DESTROY
THE PROTOTYPE

19:58.565 --> 20:01.033
BEFORE JONAS'S SUCCESS
DESTROYED YOU.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.502
AND IT WOULD
HAVE WORKED, TOO,

20:02.569 --> 20:05.638
IF IT WEREN'T
FOR THOSE MEDDLING PUPS.

20:05.705 --> 20:06.839
[BARKING]

20:15.715 --> 20:17.784
[BARKING]

20:20.953 --> 20:22.154
DO WE HAVE EVERYTHING?

20:22.221 --> 20:24.123
EVERYTHING EXCEPT
SHAGGY AND SCOOBY.

20:24.190 --> 20:25.992
WHERE COULD THEY BE?

20:30.062 --> 20:32.265
WHOO-HOO-HOO!

20:32.332 --> 20:34.000
SCOOBY-DOOBY...

20:34.066 --> 20:35.668
DOO!
DOO!

20:35.735 --> 20:37.404
HEE HEE HEE!
