WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:07.601
I can't believe the
showers are broken

00:07.636 --> 00:10.504
the day coach Pollard
makes us run five miles.

00:10.522 --> 00:13.607
I can't believe you always wear
so much makeup to gym class.

00:13.642 --> 00:15.676
Some of us care how
we look, Ally.

00:17.379 --> 00:18.679
Guess what I'm ing this weekend?

00:18.697 --> 00:20.564
A homework assignment
for physics class.

00:20.615 --> 00:22.366
I'm so excited.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.368
I'm sorry, have we met?

00:24.402 --> 00:25.653
Ally, that's Austin.

00:26.688 --> 00:28.489
I get to make paper airplanes.

00:28.523 --> 00:29.573
How fun is that?

00:29.624 --> 00:33.694
More importantly, you get to learn
about the science of aerodynamics.

00:33.712 --> 00:35.362
Huh.

00:35.380 --> 00:37.715
Suddenly, it doesn't
sound fun anymore.

00:37.749 --> 00:40.701
Well, I'm gonna be
busy this weekend too.

00:40.719 --> 00:44.388
Yeah, because your skater
boyfriend's coming into town.

00:44.422 --> 00:46.557
- Ooh.
- Skater.

00:46.591 --> 00:47.708
Guys, stop.

00:47.726 --> 00:49.376
Jace is not my boyfriend.

00:49.394 --> 00:52.379
He's just some guy that
we all met on tour.

00:52.397 --> 00:55.432
Who's coming all the way
from Albuquerque to see you.

00:55.483 --> 00:56.567
- Ooh.
- Boyfriend.

00:56.601 --> 00:58.402
Albuquerque.

00:58.436 --> 01:01.405
Guys, seriously.
It's not big deal.

01:01.439 --> 01:05.724
If it's no big deal, why do you have
his signed cast in your locker?

01:05.827 --> 01:09.330
Because he broke his wrist doing
a trick he named after me.

01:09.364 --> 01:11.332
The 360 Trish-flip.

01:11.366 --> 01:13.417
It's difficult and will
break you if you mess up.

01:13.451 --> 01:14.418
Like me.

01:14.452 --> 01:18.622
Hey, if you need dating help,
you should talk to Dr. Cupid.

01:18.673 --> 01:21.408
Oh, the advice guy on the
Marino high website?

01:22.711 --> 01:26.347
If Dr. Cupid was any good,
people would know who he was.

01:26.381 --> 01:28.465
I don't trust anyone who
has to hide their face.

01:30.802 --> 01:32.436
Aah!

01:32.470 --> 01:33.587
Jace wants to video chat.

01:33.605 --> 01:35.556
I have to hide my face.
Cover for me!

01:37.859 --> 01:38.809
Hey, Jace.

01:38.860 --> 01:40.694
Oh, hey, Dez.

01:40.729 --> 01:42.479
Uh, where's Trish?

01:42.530 --> 01:43.764
Oh. Trish can't talk right now

01:43.782 --> 01:45.816
because she's looking
all nasty and sweaty.

01:45.867 --> 01:47.785
Be thankful you can't smell her

01:47.819 --> 01:50.454
- because it is...
- Whoa-ho-ho!

01:50.488 --> 01:53.407
Are you trying to make
Jace not like me?

01:53.441 --> 01:55.743
I thought you said he
wasn't a big deal.

01:57.495 --> 02:00.381
Well... Maybe he is.

02:00.415 --> 02:01.582
I knew it!

02:01.616 --> 02:04.635
You do like him.
You're blushing.

02:04.669 --> 02:06.420
Nope, that's just
your sweaty makeup.

02:06.454 --> 02:07.638
Okay.

02:07.672 --> 02:08.722
I like Jace.

02:08.757 --> 02:10.723
I really really like him.

02:10.758 --> 02:13.310
I just don't want
him to know yet.

02:13.344 --> 02:14.344
I heard that.

03:11.619 --> 03:16.471
Lady and gentleman, the historic
first flight of Austin airlines.

03:19.377 --> 03:22.579
Austin, aerodynamics
is very complex.

03:22.630 --> 03:24.631
They gave you a physics
book for a reason.

03:24.666 --> 03:25.666
You should use it.

03:25.700 --> 03:28.552
Great idea.

03:28.586 --> 03:30.554
This page looks helpful.

03:32.540 --> 03:33.757
No, that's not what I...

03:34.809 --> 03:35.809
never mind.

03:38.379 --> 03:39.490
Jace's plane is about to land.

03:39.514 --> 03:41.381
I'm so nervous.

03:41.399 --> 03:42.683
Why? Did Austin build it?

03:45.653 --> 03:48.572
No, I'm nervous because
we're going out to dinner.

03:48.606 --> 03:50.524
I really want him to like me.

03:50.558 --> 03:53.494
Then why don't you ask that Dr.
Cupid guy for help?

03:53.528 --> 03:55.829
Only desperate losers go to Dr.
stupid.

03:55.864 --> 03:59.533
Uh, it's Dr. Cupid,
and he's brilliant.

03:59.567 --> 04:01.285
If you don't want to go to him,

04:01.336 --> 04:02.619
why don't you ask me for advice?

04:02.670 --> 04:04.454
After all, they do call me...

04:04.506 --> 04:06.623
The love whisperer.

04:06.674 --> 04:08.458
No one calls you that.

04:09.677 --> 04:11.428
Nothing personal, Dez,

04:11.462 --> 04:13.547
but I wouldn't go to you
for relationship advice

04:13.581 --> 04:15.349
if you were the last
person on earth.

04:15.383 --> 04:17.301
Ah, but if I was the
last person on earth,

04:17.351 --> 04:20.470
you wouldn't need advice
because you wouldn't be there.

04:20.522 --> 04:22.639
Unless you were the
last person on earth.

04:22.690 --> 04:25.559
In which case, I
wouldn't be there.

04:25.593 --> 04:27.477
And that kind of crazy logic

04:27.529 --> 04:29.446
is exactly why I would
never come to you.

04:29.480 --> 04:31.431
Hmm. Your loss, lady.

04:33.368 --> 04:34.628
What am I gonna do
about this date?

04:34.652 --> 04:37.621
Look, you don't need Dez or Dr.
Cupid.

04:37.655 --> 04:39.373
I'll give you advice.

04:39.407 --> 04:40.718
You know how you always
say what's on your mind?

04:40.742 --> 04:42.459
Oh boy, here we go.

04:42.493 --> 04:43.544
Yeah.

04:43.578 --> 04:45.329
Maybe you should be
a little more...

04:45.380 --> 04:46.547
Not like that.

04:46.581 --> 04:50.417
Also, I know when you get you get
defensive and call people names.

04:50.451 --> 04:52.419
I don't get defensive, you doof.

04:52.453 --> 04:54.471
Yeah, like that. Don't do that.

04:54.505 --> 04:55.816
And wear something
extra special.

04:55.840 --> 04:58.342
And laugh at everything he says.

04:58.393 --> 05:02.346
So what I'm hearing from both
of you is don't be myself?

05:02.397 --> 05:05.766
It doesn't sound great when you
say it like that, but yes.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:16.494 --> 05:18.328
Trish.

05:18.363 --> 05:19.529
It's so awesome to see you.

05:19.581 --> 05:21.782
Jace. Muah. Muah.

05:21.816 --> 05:23.617
It is truly a pleasure.

05:23.651 --> 05:26.653
Uh... Thanks?

05:26.671 --> 05:28.338
I hope I didn't
keep you waiting.

05:28.373 --> 05:29.539
No worries.

05:29.591 --> 05:30.657
I played drums with
the bread sticks,

05:30.675 --> 05:32.492
and I built a house out
of the bread sticks,

05:32.510 --> 05:34.378
and I ate the bread sticks.

05:34.429 --> 05:35.596
Yeah.

05:35.630 --> 05:37.710
There's a lot of things you
can do with bread sticks.

05:38.516 --> 05:40.767
That is so interesting.

05:40.802 --> 05:44.504
I am just so interested
in everything you say.

05:44.522 --> 05:46.506
Yeah. Thanks again.

05:50.695 --> 05:54.448
There's that sense of
humor I admire so much.

05:54.482 --> 05:56.566
It wasn't a joke.

05:56.618 --> 05:58.735
Hi, I'm Carrie.

05:58.786 --> 06:00.621
This is my first night.

06:00.655 --> 06:03.373
I'm so excited. I can't
wait to serve you.

06:04.492 --> 06:06.627
Oh. Wait a sec.

06:06.661 --> 06:08.295
Hi, mom.

06:08.329 --> 06:09.546
No, I'm not busy.

06:09.580 --> 06:12.549
No way! You got new curtains?

06:12.583 --> 06:13.583
Excuse me?

06:13.635 --> 06:14.701
Can you bring us some water?

06:14.719 --> 06:16.720
Of course not, silly.

06:16.754 --> 06:17.754
I'm on the phone.

06:17.805 --> 06:19.473
Sorry, mom.

06:19.507 --> 06:21.391
Some customer's on a date.

06:21.426 --> 06:22.726
I don't think it's going well.

06:24.812 --> 06:26.647
Good luck.

06:26.681 --> 06:28.715
Can you believe
that space cadet?

06:28.733 --> 06:30.434
Now now, Jace.

06:30.485 --> 06:31.568
No name calling.

06:31.602 --> 06:33.687
Let's not be rude.

06:33.721 --> 06:35.489
No name calling?

06:35.523 --> 06:37.491
You can't go five minutes
without calling someone

06:37.525 --> 06:38.525
a doof.

06:39.610 --> 06:42.446
You seem really different.

06:42.497 --> 06:43.580
Is everything okay?

06:43.614 --> 06:46.733
Just being my positive,
not-mean self.

06:46.751 --> 06:48.618
Are you positive
you're positive?

06:48.670 --> 06:50.704
'Cause the Trish I know
is pretty negative.

06:53.574 --> 06:54.541
Oh, Jace.

06:54.575 --> 06:56.626
There's that sense
of humor again.

07:06.554 --> 07:07.521
It's like the harder I tried,

07:07.555 --> 07:08.755
the worse the date got.

07:08.773 --> 07:10.357
I don't understand.

07:10.391 --> 07:11.591
You and Jace got along so well

07:11.609 --> 07:12.609
back in Albuquerque.

07:12.643 --> 07:15.278
Well, now that
he's actually here

07:15.313 --> 07:16.613
something feels different.

07:16.647 --> 07:18.431
I kind of know how that is.

07:18.449 --> 07:20.450
When Austin and I dated,
everything changed.

07:20.485 --> 07:22.536
- It was...
- Hello, talking about me right now.

07:23.738 --> 07:26.623
Me and Jace are supposed to
hang out again tomorrow.

07:26.657 --> 07:27.774
What am I gonna do?

07:29.494 --> 07:30.660
Oh.

07:30.712 --> 07:32.546
Well, there is that Dr.
Cupid thing.

07:32.580 --> 07:35.632
That help column for
desperate losers?

07:35.666 --> 07:37.300
Give me your laptop.

07:38.669 --> 07:40.303
Okay.

07:40.338 --> 07:43.306
I'll just tell him
what's going on,

07:43.341 --> 07:47.477
ask for his advice, hit send.

07:47.512 --> 07:49.479
Now we just wait for
him to respond.

07:49.514 --> 07:50.630
It could be a while before...

07:50.648 --> 07:53.316
Well, that was quick.

07:53.351 --> 07:54.484
Huh.

07:54.519 --> 07:57.320
Dr. Cupid thinks I was
trying too hard on my date.

07:57.355 --> 07:59.656
He thinks I should
just be myself

07:59.690 --> 08:02.325
"if he don't like
you for who you is,

08:02.360 --> 08:03.410
he ain't worth it."

08:03.444 --> 08:04.477
Hmm.

08:04.495 --> 08:05.612
That's good advice.

08:05.646 --> 08:08.448
Bad grammar, but good advice.

08:16.507 --> 08:18.491
Man, building a plane is hard.

08:18.509 --> 08:20.544
At least that one
didn't go behind you

08:20.595 --> 08:21.595
like the other ones.

08:24.632 --> 08:26.349
Tell you what, Austin.

08:26.384 --> 08:27.467
I'll help you.

08:27.501 --> 08:29.553
You're clearly in
way over your head.

08:29.604 --> 08:31.555
Thanks, Ally.

08:31.606 --> 08:34.474
Wait.

08:35.676 --> 08:37.360
I can't believe you
told that woman

08:37.395 --> 08:38.562
to shave her mustache.

08:38.613 --> 08:41.313
Well, you're the one who
said "what's up, bro?"

08:41.347 --> 08:43.450
Not my fault she
looked like a dude.

08:44.619 --> 08:45.735
You guys look happy.

08:45.787 --> 08:48.405
Yeah, I finally got to hang
out with normal Trish.

08:48.456 --> 08:50.490
Not that weird, polite Trish.

08:50.524 --> 08:52.742
Yeah, that Trish was
pretty annoying.

08:52.794 --> 08:54.661
We just had the best day ever.

08:54.695 --> 08:56.663
I gave him a tour of all
the places I've worked.

08:56.697 --> 08:58.665
So I basically got
to see all of Miami.

09:00.418 --> 09:02.385
Well, I'm gonna go
get you some fro-yo

09:02.420 --> 09:04.421
with rainbow sprinkles
and cookie crumbs.

09:04.472 --> 09:05.672
Sweeties for my sweetie.

09:05.706 --> 09:08.675
I am pretty sweet, aren't I?

09:10.511 --> 09:12.479
Why are you still standing here?

09:13.547 --> 09:14.648
That's my Trish.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.384
Looks like you might have
yourself a boyfriend.

09:18.402 --> 09:19.385
Yeah.

09:19.403 --> 09:20.581
He knows your favorite toppings

09:20.605 --> 09:22.388
and likes it when
you're mean to him.

09:22.406 --> 09:23.440
He's a keeper.

09:23.491 --> 09:25.692
And I owe it all to Dr. Cupid.

09:25.726 --> 09:27.661
His advice was perfect.

09:27.695 --> 09:30.363
The guy's a love genius.

09:31.398 --> 09:34.367
What is wrong with you?

09:34.401 --> 09:36.402
I know who Dr. Cupid is,

09:36.420 --> 09:39.422
and when I tell you, you
are going to freak out.

09:39.457 --> 09:41.458
- Well, who is he?
- He's me.

09:41.509 --> 09:42.676
I'm Dr. Cupid.

09:42.710 --> 09:44.344
- No way.
- What?

09:44.378 --> 09:45.629
That's impossible.

09:45.680 --> 09:47.297
Then how do I know

09:47.348 --> 09:49.382
that you sent Dr. Cupid
a thank you note

09:49.416 --> 09:52.302
that said "I wish I could
give you a big hug."

09:52.353 --> 09:54.387
Oh!

09:54.421 --> 09:56.523
You are Dr. Cupid!

09:56.557 --> 09:58.441
I'll take that big hug now.

10:09.700 --> 10:10.933
How could you not
tell your best friend

10:10.951 --> 10:12.619
about your secret identity?

10:12.653 --> 10:14.821
You didn't tell me you
were an international spy

10:14.872 --> 10:16.573
posing as a pop star

10:16.607 --> 10:18.575
to steal the government's
musical secrets.

10:19.877 --> 10:21.711
Because I'm not.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.946
Right.

10:23.964 --> 10:27.500
I can't believe I
took advice from you.

10:27.551 --> 10:28.718
And it worked!

10:30.588 --> 10:31.865
You know, if you think about it,

10:31.889 --> 10:33.807
Dez says some pretty
smart things.

10:34.992 --> 10:36.843
Actually, don't think about it.

10:36.894 --> 10:38.645
Just be happy he helped you.

10:38.679 --> 10:39.796
What can I say?

10:39.814 --> 10:40.814
It's a gift.

10:40.848 --> 10:41.908
I just wish I could share it

10:41.932 --> 10:43.533
with more people
around the world

10:43.567 --> 10:45.985
so they can let their
love fly free.

10:46.020 --> 10:49.572
De seriously though,
you give great advice.

10:49.607 --> 10:50.950
Why don't you let people
know who you are?

10:50.974 --> 10:53.693
I guess I'm just afraid people
wouldn't take it seriously

10:53.744 --> 10:55.722
if they know I was the one
giving them love advice.

10:55.746 --> 10:57.580
Well, we're gonna change that.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.949
Since you helped me,
I'm gonna help you.

10:59.983 --> 11:02.652
I'm gonna introduce the world to Dr.
Cupid.

11:02.670 --> 11:03.787
- Really?
- Yes.

11:03.821 --> 11:04.954
We'll do radio interviews,

11:04.988 --> 11:07.707
TV shows, book
deals, everything.

11:07.758 --> 11:10.493
I'll even write a Dr.
Cupid theme song.

11:11.629 --> 11:12.712
Ally, for the last time,

11:12.763 --> 11:14.497
not everything's about you.

11:22.606 --> 11:25.558
I really hope Dez's radio
interview goes well.

11:25.609 --> 11:27.811
After what he did
for me and Jace,

11:27.845 --> 11:29.846
I really want to
see him succeed.

11:29.864 --> 11:31.531
Now that you have a boyfriend,

11:31.565 --> 11:32.992
it's like you're a totally
different person.

11:33.016 --> 11:34.818
When Dr. Cupid blows up,

11:34.852 --> 11:35.902
I'll make millions.

11:35.953 --> 11:38.521
Maybe not that different.

11:38.539 --> 11:41.574
Welcome to love chat,
pretty babies.

11:41.625 --> 11:44.577
This is dj Sonny smooth,

11:44.628 --> 11:47.530
and today, we have a
very special guest,

11:47.548 --> 11:51.000
Marino high school's love guru, Dr.
Cupid.

11:51.034 --> 11:52.886
Great to be here.

11:52.920 --> 11:56.973
Do I have to talk like
this the whole time?

11:57.007 --> 11:58.875
No, that's my thing.

11:58.893 --> 12:00.727
Aw, too bad.

12:00.761 --> 12:02.846
This is fun.

12:02.880 --> 12:04.564
Seriously, don't do that.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.602
Okay, we've got a bunch
of love questions

12:09.653 --> 12:10.603
from our listeners.

12:10.654 --> 12:11.771
Happy to answer them.

12:11.822 --> 12:14.490
"Me and my girlfriend go
to different schools,

12:14.525 --> 12:15.802
so I don't get to
see her enough.

12:15.826 --> 12:18.611
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose her."

12:19.864 --> 12:21.731
You need to make the
moments you spend together

12:21.749 --> 12:24.951
so memorable that she
can't wait to see you.

12:25.002 --> 12:27.921
Bring her flowers or a goat.

12:27.955 --> 12:29.572
A goat?

12:29.590 --> 12:30.817
I never thought about
giving my lady

12:30.841 --> 12:32.508
a farm animal.

12:32.543 --> 12:33.543
That's smooth.

12:34.845 --> 12:36.512
Here's another one.

12:36.547 --> 12:37.847
"I'm dating this guy.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.549
I love hanging with him,

12:39.583 --> 12:42.969
but I'm not sure I love him."

12:45.556 --> 12:47.857
When you're in love, u'll know.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.893
<i>The whole world is brighter.</i>

12:49.927 --> 12:52.862
Pizza tastes better,
goats are cuter.

12:54.598 --> 12:55.698
Wow.

12:55.733 --> 12:57.867
You know a lot about love.

12:57.902 --> 12:58.902
And goats.

12:59.954 --> 13:01.771
I bet you're quite
the ladies' man.

13:01.789 --> 13:05.742
Oh, I've never
actually been in love.

13:05.776 --> 13:07.627
I've never even
had a girlfriend.

13:07.661 --> 13:09.779
In fact, I've never
been on a date.

13:12.633 --> 13:13.950
So if you've never
been on a date,

13:13.968 --> 13:16.786
how can you call
yourself a love expert?

13:16.804 --> 13:18.721
Because I have this doctor coat

13:18.756 --> 13:19.923
that says "Dr. Cupid"?

13:19.957 --> 13:21.624
And this thing, and this thing.

13:21.642 --> 13:22.842
So what I'm hearing is

13:22.893 --> 13:25.645
you are completely
unqualified to give advice

13:25.679 --> 13:26.796
on love.

13:28.649 --> 13:29.899
I guess I am unqualified.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.936
You heard it here
first, pretty babies.

13:32.970 --> 13:35.972
Dr. Cupid is a huge fraud.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.534
Hey, lly. Ready to help me

13:48.585 --> 13:49.619
build my paper airplane?

13:49.653 --> 13:50.837
Nope.

13:50.871 --> 13:53.506
Because I finished the
whole thing last night.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.509
Ta-da!

13:56.543 --> 13:57.660
Wow.

13:57.678 --> 13:59.762
Is that a flight attendant?

13:59.797 --> 14:02.849
Yep. See how she's handing out
those tiny bags of pretzels?

14:05.502 --> 14:06.803
Thanks for doing all this, Ally,

14:06.837 --> 14:08.938
but I feel kind of weird
that I didn't help at all.

14:08.973 --> 14:11.891
Well, there's still
one decal to put on.

14:11.942 --> 14:12.892
You can do that.

14:12.943 --> 14:13.943
Okay.

14:15.512 --> 14:16.896
Not there.

14:16.947 --> 14:18.531
Not there.

14:19.683 --> 14:20.817
- Ooh.
- You know what?

14:20.851 --> 14:21.851
I'll just do it.

14:25.572 --> 14:28.658
- Hey, Dez.
- What's the point?

14:28.692 --> 14:30.793
Um, the point of saying "hello"?

14:30.828 --> 14:33.663
You heard dj Sonny smooth.

14:33.697 --> 14:35.498
I'm a fraud.

14:35.532 --> 14:38.634
This is why I didn't want
anyone to know I'm Dr. Cupid.

14:38.669 --> 14:39.869
You still give great advice.

14:39.887 --> 14:41.504
It doesn't matter.

14:41.538 --> 14:43.506
Everybody has somebody
except for me.

14:43.540 --> 14:44.557
Trish has Jace,

14:44.591 --> 14:45.708
the president has
the first lady,

14:45.726 --> 14:46.966
you guys have your weird thing.

14:49.546 --> 14:50.786
I'm done giving advice on love.

14:52.566 --> 14:53.886
'Cause I'm never
gonna find love.

14:56.603 --> 14:58.855
Dez, you can't give up.

14:58.889 --> 15:02.492
You're... The love whisperer.

15:02.526 --> 15:04.911
Nobody calls me that.

15:09.616 --> 15:11.451
Dez, wait. Come back.

15:11.502 --> 15:13.453
I feel terrible for him.

15:13.504 --> 15:15.621
Me too.

15:15.672 --> 15:17.707
Why are we whispering?

15:17.741 --> 15:20.510
I don't know.

15:26.049 --> 15:30.820
♪ Table for one ♪
at the lonely cafe

15:30.854 --> 15:33.055
<i>♪ I'm on a date by myself ♪</i>

15:33.073 --> 15:37.910
♪ and it's my birthday.

15:37.945 --> 15:39.912
Are you trying to write a song?

15:39.947 --> 15:41.080
I don't know.

15:41.114 --> 15:42.949
It's what Ally does
when she's upset.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.951
Yeah, but I know
how to play piano.

15:47.838 --> 15:50.623
Dez, you have a lot
to offer a girl.

15:50.674 --> 15:51.958
You're funny, you're smart.

15:52.009 --> 15:54.627
You're creative.
You've got style.

15:55.929 --> 15:57.913
Oh, did you want me
to say something?

15:59.016 --> 16:03.686
Uh... You have red hair.
Your name is Dez.

16:05.772 --> 16:06.889
Thanks, Trish.

16:08.775 --> 16:10.810
Dez, you shouldn't
give up on love.

16:10.861 --> 16:13.646
You can't just quit something
because it seems hard.

16:13.697 --> 16:15.597
There's a girl out
there for you.

16:15.615 --> 16:17.733
Any girl would be
lucky to have you.

16:18.902 --> 16:20.619
You're right.

16:20.654 --> 16:22.938
Maybe I haven't
tried hard enough.

16:22.956 --> 16:25.607
You know what? I'm
not gonna give up.

16:25.625 --> 16:27.609
I'm gonna go out there
and find me a girl.

16:27.627 --> 16:28.944
Whoo! Yeah!

17:07.951 --> 17:11.587
Oh, I see you're reading "the
case of the missing diamonds."

17:11.621 --> 17:12.621
I read that too.

17:12.655 --> 17:13.873
Did you get to the end

17:13.924 --> 17:15.902
where you find out the
detective stole the diamonds?

17:15.925 --> 17:17.710
Oh! I did not see that coming.

17:23.665 --> 17:24.833
Don't feel so bad.

17:24.851 --> 17:26.931
At least now she doesn't
have to read the whole book.

17:33.643 --> 17:34.777
Poor Dez.

17:34.811 --> 17:36.695
He is such a catch.

17:37.847 --> 17:40.783
Again, I have no idea
where that came from.

17:40.817 --> 17:42.684
We have to do something.

17:42.702 --> 17:44.070
I have an idea.

17:44.121 --> 17:46.021
There's only one person
who can help Dez.

17:46.039 --> 17:47.790
Dr. Cupid.

17:47.824 --> 17:49.992
We'll get Dez to
give himself advice.

17:50.026 --> 17:52.044
That doesn't make
any sense at all.

17:52.079 --> 17:53.963
Exactly.

17:53.997 --> 17:55.030
Neither does Dez.

18:03.590 --> 18:04.723
Hey, Dez.

18:04.758 --> 18:06.725
We know that Dr.
Cupid is retired,

18:06.760 --> 18:10.012
but we have a really good
friend who needs help.

18:10.046 --> 18:11.880
What's his name?

18:11.898 --> 18:13.715
Uh, zed.

18:13.733 --> 18:14.733
- Bob.
- Mordecai.

18:16.937 --> 18:20.739
Well, tell zed Bob
mordecai to give up.

18:20.774 --> 18:22.908
Love is a big waste of time.

18:22.943 --> 18:25.744
At least listen to his problem.

18:25.779 --> 18:27.913
Fine.

18:27.948 --> 18:30.666
"Dear Dr. Cupid,

18:30.700 --> 18:32.618
I've tried everything
to meet a girl.

18:32.669 --> 18:34.587
Exercise near them,

18:34.621 --> 18:36.589
ruined endings of
books for them,

18:36.623 --> 18:37.906
but nothing's worked.

18:37.924 --> 18:39.758
Please tell me what to do.

18:39.793 --> 18:41.760
You're my only hope."

18:41.795 --> 18:45.014
What a loser.

18:46.099 --> 18:48.017
He's clearly trying too hard.

18:48.051 --> 18:49.685
You can't force love.

18:49.719 --> 18:51.854
You have to let
love come to you.

18:51.888 --> 18:54.607
That's great advice, Dez.

18:54.641 --> 18:55.924
Maybe you should take it.

18:55.942 --> 18:57.092
What?

18:57.110 --> 18:59.862
We tricked you into
giving yourself advice.

18:59.896 --> 19:00.946
You're the loser!

19:02.649 --> 19:03.699
It was all my idea.

19:03.733 --> 19:05.734
They were all like "oh no.
What do we do?"

19:05.768 --> 19:07.736
And I was all like
"I got an idea."

19:07.770 --> 19:09.955
They didn't have an idea.
I had an idea.

19:11.941 --> 19:13.876
It doesn't matter how
great your idea was.

19:13.910 --> 19:15.044
Even I can't help me.

19:18.948 --> 19:20.633
Well that didn't work.

19:20.667 --> 19:21.800
Yeah.

19:21.835 --> 19:23.586
Whose dumb idea was that?

19:35.965 --> 19:38.984
You look like you just got
rejected by a dozen girls.

19:39.019 --> 19:40.853
You can tell that
from looking at me?

19:40.904 --> 19:45.608
No, I literally watched you get
rejected by a dozen girls.

19:45.642 --> 19:48.027
Everybody makes
dating look so easy.

19:48.078 --> 19:50.829
It is easy, except
for when it isn't.

19:50.864 --> 19:52.031
Then it's hard.

19:52.082 --> 19:54.867
You sound like you know
what you're talking about.

19:54.918 --> 19:56.952
Well, they call me...

19:56.986 --> 19:59.038
The love robot.

19:59.089 --> 20:02.041
Actually, nobody calls me that.

20:03.710 --> 20:04.793
Anyway, I should go.

20:04.827 --> 20:05.905
There's this new
zombie romance movie

20:05.929 --> 20:07.846
- I want to see.
- "Tears of the dead"?

20:07.881 --> 20:09.048
I love zombie romance movies.

20:09.099 --> 20:10.966
Really? Me too.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.935
I would ask my
boyfriend to take me,

20:12.969 --> 20:14.970
but I don't have a boyfriend.

20:15.004 --> 20:16.855
I'm totally single.

20:16.890 --> 20:20.643
Just like me.

20:20.677 --> 20:23.979
Well... Off to the
movies by myself.

20:27.784 --> 20:29.068
Carrie, wait.

20:29.119 --> 20:30.852
Yeah?

20:30.870 --> 20:32.871
I forgot my backpack. See ya.

20:35.858 --> 20:36.992
Hang on.

20:37.026 --> 20:38.994
You know,

20:39.028 --> 20:41.997
I once gave me some
really great advice.

20:42.031 --> 20:43.832
You can't force love.

20:43.866 --> 20:46.085
You have to let
love come to you.

20:46.136 --> 20:48.671
I think that might be
what's happening right now.

20:48.705 --> 20:50.055
Are you asking me out?

20:50.090 --> 20:52.007
No.

20:52.041 --> 20:54.843
I don't want to force love.

20:54.877 --> 20:57.730
I'll just let you know that
the movie starts in an hour,

20:57.764 --> 20:58.908
there'll be an open
seat next to me,

20:58.932 --> 21:01.650
and I'd be happy if you
ended up sitting in it.

21:02.936 --> 21:04.720
Also, is my food ready?

21:04.738 --> 21:05.938
I ordered it like an hour ago.

21:07.657 --> 21:08.774
Sorry.

21:08.825 --> 21:10.776
I'll be right back
with your burger.

21:12.662 --> 21:13.779
It was a salad.

21:23.006 --> 21:25.090
So how was your first date ever?

21:25.125 --> 21:27.626
A-mazing!

21:27.677 --> 21:29.094
She showed up and everything.

21:30.747 --> 21:32.080
As tit w best night of my life.

21:32.098 --> 21:33.716
Great.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.934
Does that mean Dr. Cupid is
coming out of retirement?

21:37.053 --> 21:38.804
I can't believe I'm saying this,

21:38.855 --> 21:41.757
but I need your advice again.

21:41.775 --> 21:43.058
I'm your best friend, Trish.

21:43.092 --> 21:44.059
Why don't you talk
to me about...

21:44.093 --> 21:45.978
I need good advice.

21:47.697 --> 21:48.958
Dez, Jace is leaving
out of town,

21:48.982 --> 21:50.098
and I need tips on how to handle

21:50.116 --> 21:51.700
a long-distance relationship.

21:51.735 --> 21:52.901
You got it.

21:52.935 --> 21:54.870
Dr. Cupid will see you now.

21:54.904 --> 21:58.073
Guess who got a great grade
on their physics assignment?

21:58.107 --> 21:59.742
I knew it!

21:59.776 --> 22:00.826
You got an "A."

22:00.877 --> 22:03.045
Actually, I got a "B-."

22:03.079 --> 22:04.079
What?

22:04.113 --> 22:05.781
That was an "A+" plane.

22:05.799 --> 22:08.000
It had beverage service!

22:08.051 --> 22:10.786
I didn't turn in your plane.

22:10.804 --> 22:11.804
I made my own.

22:20.647 --> 22:21.680
Why would you do that?

22:21.731 --> 22:23.965
I told Dez not to give up,

22:23.983 --> 22:25.684
so I couldn't either.

22:25.735 --> 22:27.986
It was more important to
me to accomplish something

22:28.021 --> 22:29.638
than to get a good grade.

22:29.656 --> 22:31.105
And it turns out, I got both.

22:32.044 --> 22:34.813
I'm really proud of you, Austin.

22:36.715 --> 22:39.084
He thinks "B-" is a good grade.

23:01.841 --> 23:03.842
Flowers?

23:03.876 --> 23:04.976
Pizza!

23:05.010 --> 23:06.077
I got you something else.

23:09.815 --> 23:10.849
A goat?!

23:10.883 --> 23:12.851
You really do like me.
