[ominous growling]

01:39.432 --> 01:41.935
[growling in the distance]

02:04.541 --> 02:06.376
[Dale]
It's all about mind control...

02:07.252 --> 02:08.962
Lot of animals can do it.

02:09.045 --> 02:11.673
I'm not just talking about animals you
never heard the name of before.

02:12.465 --> 02:14.676
Insects, amphibians,
even house cats can do it--

02:14.759 --> 02:17.428
-Get the fuck outta here.
-It's true, look it up.

02:17.512 --> 02:21.599
House cats have this parasite called
toxoplasmosis. You know what it does?

02:22.517 --> 02:25.228
It makes field mice not scared
of cats anymore.

02:25.311 --> 02:27.147
[Gerry] Why would the cats want that?

02:28.314 --> 02:29.315
So they can eat 'em.

02:30.441 --> 02:32.527
Field mice isn't scared of cats,
it walks right up to it

02:32.610 --> 02:34.487
and presents itself like lunch.

02:34.571 --> 02:35.947
It's meals on
fuckin' wheels.

02:36.030 --> 02:37.240
-That's not true.
-[Dale] It is true.

02:37.323 --> 02:38.449
It's not fucking true.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.785
It is fucking true and it's not just
field mice that they're infecting.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.620
They're infecting human beings.

02:42.704 --> 02:45.790
Every human being on the fucking planet
that has a cat. It's true.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.251
What's better than a dozen
dead field mice?

02:48.334 --> 02:50.211
It's one brainwashed human being

02:50.295 --> 02:52.589
that's bringing you Fancy Feast
every five minutes.

02:52.672 --> 02:55.466
That's why Carol Baker has these dozen
fucking cats in her house.

02:55.550 --> 02:57.260
-No shit.
-[Dale] Yeah.

02:57.343 --> 02:58.720
I knew she was crazy.

02:58.803 --> 02:59.846
[Dale] She's nuts, man.

02:59.929 --> 03:02.348
Leave Carol Baker out of this, all right?
She's a nice old lady.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.559
She just misses
her husband.

03:04.642 --> 03:08.271
No. Carol Baker's not even
Carol Baker anymore.

03:08.938 --> 03:11.691
Now she's a slave
to her cat overlords.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.735
[Harry]
This is the worst week of the year.

03:13.818 --> 03:15.612
All the college girls leave

03:15.695 --> 03:18.573
and all I'm left with are you...
fucking crazies.

03:18.656 --> 03:20.575
[Dale] Yeah, go buy a cat,
see what happens.

03:20.658 --> 03:22.535
Where are you going?
Can you give me a ride?

03:23.328 --> 03:24.537
[Harry]
I've gotta get home, Dale.

03:24.621 --> 03:25.747
It's on your way!

03:29.334 --> 03:30.418
Bye, Gerry!

03:34.839 --> 03:36.841
It's the same thing that happened
with the Palatine

03:36.925 --> 03:38.635
a hundred fucking years ago,
man.

03:38.718 --> 03:41.012
That ship didn't get raided
by pirates and sink.

03:41.095 --> 03:44.682
No, no... a fucking sea creature came
out of the depths

03:44.766 --> 03:47.393
and infected all the crew
with a parasite

03:47.477 --> 03:50.021
that made 'em go crazy and jump
overboard, so it could eat 'em.

03:50.104 --> 03:51.731
Everybody knows that.

03:51.856 --> 03:54.692
Symbiotic. Codependent.
And now the government is harnessing

03:54.776 --> 03:57.612
the power of the parasites and putting
it in the vaccines with our kids--

03:57.695 --> 03:58.613
What are you doing?

03:58.696 --> 04:00.198
-Unbuckling your seat belt.
-Why?

04:00.281 --> 04:01.866
So when I drive into that telephone pole,

04:01.950 --> 04:03.993
you're gonna shoot through the windshield
and then I'll never have to hear about

04:04.077 --> 04:07.664
fucking chemtrails,
and 9/11, and mind control,

04:07.747 --> 04:09.791
and fucking lizard people again.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.543
That's fucked up...

04:14.337 --> 04:16.130
I don't believe in lizard people.

04:17.465 --> 04:18.299
[loud thud]

04:18.383 --> 04:20.301
-[Harry] Holy shit!
-[tires screeching]

04:34.899 --> 04:36.109
It's still alive.

04:36.859 --> 04:38.903
Where the fuck did that come from?

04:42.949 --> 04:44.325
What are you doing?

04:45.410 --> 04:46.828
Put it out of its misery...

04:48.705 --> 04:50.331
You want me to hit it with a rock?

04:50.415 --> 04:52.417
Yeah, it's a kindness.
That's what you do.

05:02.176 --> 05:03.386
It's dead.

05:06.931 --> 05:08.141
Are you sure?

05:08.516 --> 05:09.934
[Harry] Get in the car.

05:25.575 --> 05:26.617
Dad?

05:44.594 --> 05:46.179
[dog barking in distance]

05:52.310 --> 05:53.352
Dad?

05:54.103 --> 05:55.521
[dog continues barking]

05:57.690 --> 05:59.650
[ominous growling]

06:05.948 --> 06:07.033
Dad.

06:08.451 --> 06:10.787
[ominous growling continues]

06:11.120 --> 06:12.371
Dad!

06:15.958 --> 06:16.793
Huh?

06:16.876 --> 06:18.544
What are you doing out here?

06:22.298 --> 06:23.674
Dog's barking...

06:31.766 --> 06:34.102
Look, I don't want to catch you
sleepwalking again, Dad.

06:34.185 --> 06:35.728
-[Tom] All right, all right...
-No more caffeine.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.271
All right, all right,
I'm going to sleep.

06:37.355 --> 06:39.107
Yeah, well sooner or later you're gonna
be sleep-driving

06:39.190 --> 06:41.067
and you're gonna be sleep-crashing.
Yeah.

06:41.150 --> 06:43.069
What are you gonna
start singing lullabies now?

06:43.569 --> 06:44.737
Don't let the bed bugs bite.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.906
[laughing] Get the fuck outta here.

06:55.414 --> 06:58.126
[ticking growing loud]

06:58.209 --> 07:00.878
[Audry] Yeah, today is kinda tricky
for me, can Paul go on his own?

07:00.962 --> 07:02.713
[man]
Chief Rogers requested you by name.

07:02.797 --> 07:03.798
I'm sure he did.

07:03.881 --> 07:06.217
Listen, it's gonna be a whole thing
with school...

07:06.300 --> 07:07.718
-Mom.
-...and I'm gonna have to drop in

07:07.802 --> 07:08.928
-on my dad and brother...
-Mom?

07:09.011 --> 07:12.348
...on the island, and, look, I'm sorry,
I've just got a lot on my plate right now.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.059
[man] Look, I think this could be
a legitimate problem we have on our hands.

07:15.143 --> 07:16.978
Just don't tell your family
you'll be on the island.

07:17.061 --> 07:20.440
Yeah, that's not really how it works.
Block Island is a small place.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.400
Mom, I don't want toast.

07:22.483 --> 07:24.861
-Well, what do you want?
-[Emily] Fruity Pebbles.

07:24.944 --> 07:27.613
-We're out of milk.
-We've been out of milk all week.

07:27.697 --> 07:30.324
Emily, it's either toast
or cereal with water.

07:30.408 --> 07:31.993
-Mom!
-[man] Audry?

07:32.076 --> 07:35.288
Yeah, sorry. Sorry, listen,
Paul is perfectly capable,

07:35.371 --> 07:37.039
he'll be fine to go
without me.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.708
[man]
Audry, everybody's got family problems.

07:38.791 --> 07:41.502
I don't want to argue with you
over an assignment, okay?

07:41.586 --> 07:42.670
Yeah.

07:42.753 --> 07:44.881
[man] There's a ferry at 7:30,
make sure you're on it.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.720
Wanna go on a field trip?

07:52.138 --> 07:54.015
[boat horn blaring]

08:02.648 --> 08:05.526
[Paul] Hey, hey!
Look who gets to play hooky!

08:05.610 --> 08:06.986
Can you say hi to Paul?

08:07.445 --> 08:08.654
Hi, Emily.

08:09.655 --> 08:12.366
Must be nice having an excuse to make a
trip back home...

08:12.700 --> 08:13.910
[Audry] Yeah...

08:14.160 --> 08:15.328
You get back often?

08:15.411 --> 08:18.289
Uh, less and less since my mom died.

08:19.081 --> 08:22.001
My brother is just kinda,
I don't know...

08:22.084 --> 08:22.960
An asshole?

08:23.044 --> 08:27.256
Emily... let's just not say that
to Uncle Harry's face, okay?

08:48.569 --> 08:49.612
Dad!

08:55.493 --> 08:56.494
Dad?

09:08.130 --> 09:10.633
Lynch boathouse to Patty M.
Do you copy? Over.

09:13.052 --> 09:15.555
Dad, it's Harry.
Where are you? Over.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.602
The house is burning down...

09:26.357 --> 09:27.942
Dad! Wake up!

09:28.025 --> 09:30.528
[voice over radio] Sir,
this line is for operational use only.

09:30.611 --> 09:32.321
All right, keep your skirt on.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.081
[Audry]
My brother's not an asshole.

09:42.164 --> 09:44.959
It was just tough
after my mom died.

09:46.210 --> 09:49.505
Harry just... he has a temper.

09:54.176 --> 09:55.511
Where were you?

09:56.304 --> 09:58.055
I took the boat out this morning.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.057
This morning, or last night?

10:03.144 --> 10:04.020
Dad.

10:04.103 --> 10:06.939
Can you tie off the other end,
or are you gonna make me do it myself?

10:09.900 --> 10:11.360
Can you remember?

10:11.444 --> 10:13.529
-[phone vibrating]
-Was it dark out when you left?

10:17.199 --> 10:18.659
-Hello?
-[Audry] Hey, Dad.

10:18.743 --> 10:20.328
I'm on the island.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.371
Mind if I crash at the place
for a couple nights?

10:22.455 --> 10:23.914
Oh, no, that's great!

10:24.498 --> 10:25.958
You got Emily with ya?

10:35.843 --> 10:38.679
[Rogers] The island is a totally different
beast this time of year.

10:38.763 --> 10:42.058
About 15 to 20 thousand folks
over the summer,

10:42.141 --> 10:44.393
and just a thousand
all year long.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.937
-That's rounding up...
-Yeah maybe...

10:47.563 --> 10:50.191
So, what's going on
down at West Beach?

10:50.775 --> 10:53.569
Well... we got a bit of a fish problem.

10:55.196 --> 10:57.782
Tons of dead ones were rolling up
on the shore.

10:58.282 --> 10:59.367
[Audry] How many?

10:59.825 --> 11:02.953
Hard to tell.
Maybe nine or ten?

11:03.913 --> 11:06.290
Nine or ten what? Fish?

11:06.874 --> 11:10.127
Tons. Nine or ten tons.

11:23.682 --> 11:26.268
[Audry]
When did this happen, yesterday?

11:27.061 --> 11:29.730
Well, uh, you know,
not all at once.

11:29.897 --> 11:30.815
It's rancid.

11:32.691 --> 11:33.692
Emily, don't touch that.

11:35.027 --> 11:36.278
Come here.

11:38.114 --> 11:40.074
What does that mean, not all at once?

11:40.157 --> 11:42.451
Every few days a new batch rolls up.

11:43.702 --> 11:46.664
Bill Ryan pulled in a whole net of them
on Saturday.

11:47.331 --> 11:51.627
Anna Miller and her kid found 'em,
what, three weeks ago?

11:52.837 --> 11:56.424
You remember Anna?
She's got a kid now.

11:56.507 --> 11:59.176
[talking indistinctly]

12:11.897 --> 12:14.108
[Harry] Well, I'm glad you guys are
finally cleaning up that mess.

12:14.191 --> 12:16.402
The whole west side of the island smells
like taint.

12:17.027 --> 12:18.362
What's taint?

12:18.446 --> 12:20.406
-"Taint none of your business."
-Harry.

12:20.489 --> 12:22.158
So what do you think's been killing 'em?

12:22.241 --> 12:23.993
[Paul] Could be hypoxia.

12:24.076 --> 12:25.744
No, what's that?

12:25.828 --> 12:28.497
It's basically when too many fish are in
a certain area

12:28.581 --> 12:31.208
they can deplete the oxygen
in the water too fast...

12:31.292 --> 12:33.461
[Tom]
So, what? They drown?

12:33.544 --> 12:35.129
-Kinda, yeah...
-They suffocate.

12:35.212 --> 12:36.881
Fish suffocating. That's a trip.

12:36.964 --> 12:38.507
[Paul]
Yeah, right? It happens.

12:38.924 --> 12:41.135
So where's the EPA putting you tonight?
Somewhere swank?

12:41.218 --> 12:43.471
Oh, no, I'm just gonna be taking the ferry
back and forth.

12:43.554 --> 12:45.306
Oh, that's crazy.
You should stay here with us.

12:45.389 --> 12:47.725
-Oh, that's okay--
-No, come on. We've got plenty of room.

12:47.808 --> 12:49.685
-You and Audry can take the queen.
-Dad!

12:49.810 --> 12:51.437
-Jesus Christ...
-[Tom] What?

12:52.104 --> 12:54.106
I'm just gonna, uh... use the rest room.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.028
-[Audry] Are you kidding me?
-What?

12:59.153 --> 13:00.905
He works for me. I'm his boss.

13:00.988 --> 13:02.156
Yeah, Dad. That's weird.

13:02.239 --> 13:05.075
-Oh give me a break.
-It's totally inappropriate.

13:05.159 --> 13:08.537
I just think that Emily should have
a father figure in her life.

13:09.121 --> 13:10.581
Dad...

13:10.664 --> 13:13.626
[Tom] Hey, Paul,
let me give you a lift to the ferry!

13:13.709 --> 13:15.544
-[Harry] No!
-I'm gonna take him.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.588
Do you mind keeping
an eye on Emily?

13:21.634 --> 13:23.093
[Emily] What about those ones?

13:23.177 --> 13:25.179
[Harry]
No, those are too small.

13:25.721 --> 13:31.727
Here, this stuff...
this stuff is like crack to fish.

13:32.269 --> 13:33.562
What's crack?

13:34.146 --> 13:36.565
It's like cocaine,
but you can smoke it.

13:41.403 --> 13:43.989
Now you gotta be patient until you see
some fish...

13:49.161 --> 13:51.038
What about those ones?

13:52.039 --> 13:52.998
Where?

13:54.124 --> 13:55.459
There.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.131
[Harry] Oh, wow.

14:01.215 --> 14:04.343
Yeah, uh, maybe this wasn't
such a good idea--

14:04.426 --> 14:05.636
What's wrong with them?

14:05.719 --> 14:09.014
You know what? Why don't we go try
to catch some frogs in the marsh?

14:09.348 --> 14:10.558
Okay.

14:13.644 --> 14:17.273
[ominous music building]

14:25.489 --> 14:29.285
[heavy breathing]

14:34.164 --> 14:37.418
[inhuman growling]

14:41.922 --> 14:44.258
[growling builds and then ceases]

14:44.341 --> 14:47.511
Well, I guess that's the last coworker
of mine you'll ever meet.

14:50.014 --> 14:50.931
Dad?

14:53.267 --> 14:54.643
Dad, I think it's full.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.147
Huh? Oh.

15:00.441 --> 15:01.817
Can I get ya something?

15:03.485 --> 15:04.653
You okay?

15:05.237 --> 15:06.405
You bet.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.207
[Audry]
Hey, what's going on with Dad?

15:17.791 --> 15:18.918
What do you mean?

15:19.043 --> 15:21.587
I just caught him drifting off,
all spaced out.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.131
He's fine.

15:24.465 --> 15:25.716
[Audry] It was weird.

15:26.342 --> 15:27.760
I'm taking care of him, Audry.

15:27.843 --> 15:29.803
I'm not accusing you of anything,
I'm just--

15:29.887 --> 15:31.013
[Harry] He's getting older.

15:31.555 --> 15:33.849
You might notice that
if you came by a little more often.

15:34.516 --> 15:37.811
Okay. Sorry.
Didn't mean anything by it.

15:41.899 --> 15:43.275
Dad's good.

15:48.864 --> 15:50.115
[Audry] You brush your teeth?

15:50.199 --> 15:51.450
Yeah.

15:51.533 --> 15:53.827
If you need me,
I'm right down the hall, okay?

15:53.911 --> 15:54.912
Okay.

15:54.995 --> 15:57.164
And if you get cold you have a sweater
in your backpack...

15:57.247 --> 15:58.207
Wait!

16:02.336 --> 16:03.504
What's this?

16:03.879 --> 16:05.047
[Emily] Nothing.

16:05.506 --> 16:06.674
Where did you get this?

16:07.132 --> 16:09.218
Uncle Harry said I could keep him.

16:09.301 --> 16:10.761
[Audry]
Oh, he did, did he?

16:11.971 --> 16:14.306
Don't you think this frog
is gonna miss his family?

16:15.140 --> 16:18.978
[Emily] Uncle Harry said you take animals
from the water all the time.

16:19.645 --> 16:23.148
That's different.
Most of them go back in the ocean.

16:23.565 --> 16:25.192
[Emily] But not all of them.

16:26.318 --> 16:27.444
Almost.

16:29.613 --> 16:31.240
Some of them die.

16:36.495 --> 16:39.248
Are you thinking about the fish we saw
on the beach?

16:42.418 --> 16:44.128
I know it's confusing.

16:45.045 --> 16:46.880
But most of the fish
we take out of the water

16:46.964 --> 16:49.425
we put right back in
just a few days later.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.635
We're learning about them.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.763
We're studying them
so we can get to know them better.

16:54.930 --> 16:56.598
So we can help them better.

16:58.267 --> 17:01.311
But how are you helping them
if some of them end up dead?

17:04.023 --> 17:07.401
I know it sounds mean and scary...

17:08.027 --> 17:12.489
but by taking some brave fish
out of the water and learning about them,

17:13.115 --> 17:15.701
we can eventually help
all the other fish.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.912
It's a good thing we're doing.

17:20.789 --> 17:22.875
I just want to learn about him.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.253
We'll see.

17:41.101 --> 17:45.105
[ominous music]

18:07.169 --> 18:10.089
[footsteps approaching]

18:10.172 --> 18:12.591
[shallow breathing]

18:26.522 --> 18:29.691
-[dog barking]
-[Emily screaming]

18:35.656 --> 18:37.491
Hey, what's going on?

18:39.827 --> 18:41.578
I think she had a nightmare.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.293
Hey, are you okay?

18:48.377 --> 18:49.545
What happened?

18:49.628 --> 18:51.088
You okay, sweetheart?

18:57.344 --> 19:00.722
Maybe she had a nightmare...
she fell out of bed?

19:04.893 --> 19:06.270
Is she okay?

19:06.353 --> 19:07.855
What the hell was that?

19:08.856 --> 19:12.234
She probably had a nightmare.
She woke up in a strange place--

19:12.317 --> 19:14.570
No, no, something's wrong with Dad.

19:15.279 --> 19:16.738
What was he doing in there?

19:17.656 --> 19:19.199
What do you think happened?

19:20.033 --> 19:23.036
I don't know, but he really scared her.

19:23.745 --> 19:25.414
How much did he drink tonight?

19:26.165 --> 19:27.958
He didn't do anything.

19:30.043 --> 19:32.462
Listen, we're gonna take the first
ferry out tomorrow morning.

19:32.546 --> 19:35.924
Audry, you're overreacting.
She had a nightmare. It's not a big deal.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.676
It doesn't make sense for her to be here

19:37.759 --> 19:39.636
while I work anyway,
so we're just gonna go.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.680
It'll kill him if you take off
first thing.

19:43.473 --> 19:45.475
Just stay for breakfast, okay?

19:47.144 --> 19:48.812
He's not some monster.

19:49.605 --> 19:50.439
[Emily] Mom?

19:51.190 --> 19:52.816
Yeah, I'm coming, Em...

19:53.775 --> 19:55.068
See you in the morning.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.376
[Harry] What are you doing?

20:12.044 --> 20:13.003
We're heading out.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.756
Audry, stay for breakfast.

20:15.839 --> 20:19.134
[Audry] The ferry leaves at eight, if we
miss it, the next one's not 'til noon.

20:21.428 --> 20:22.888
How'd he take it?

20:23.639 --> 20:25.057
He's not up yet.

20:25.140 --> 20:26.141
He's not?

20:26.225 --> 20:27.476
His door's still shut.

20:27.559 --> 20:28.685
[Harry] Shit.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.646
-What?
-He's gone.

20:37.945 --> 20:40.530
Lynch house to the Patty M.
Do you copy?

20:40.614 --> 20:43.116
He was hammered last night,
he's gonna get himself killed out there.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.744
Lynch house to the Patty M.
Do you copy? Over.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.622
[Audry] He's not responding.

20:48.705 --> 20:50.958
Sometimes he goes out
in the morning to fish.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.961
[Emily] I saw him leave last night.

20:55.837 --> 20:57.464
Are you sure it was last night?

20:58.257 --> 20:59.841
It was dark out.

21:15.732 --> 21:16.900
He's over there!

21:17.192 --> 21:18.026
Where?

21:18.110 --> 21:19.444
Down by West Beach!

21:23.448 --> 21:24.491
Dad?

21:24.574 --> 21:27.411
-[Audry] Dad!
-Dad, you okay? Shit.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.208
[inhuman grumbling]

21:33.292 --> 21:34.418
Is he down there?

21:35.252 --> 21:37.254
The place is fucking ransacked!

21:39.047 --> 21:41.425
[grumbling continues]

21:41.508 --> 21:43.510
The fuck is that noise?

21:45.137 --> 21:46.638
[radio static]

21:47.347 --> 21:48.307
[static ceases]

21:48.390 --> 21:49.683
Radio's shot.

21:52.185 --> 21:54.104
Jesus Christ,
what the hell happened to him?

21:56.273 --> 21:58.025
[Audry]
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

21:58.108 --> 21:59.609
Man overboard, and missing.

21:59.693 --> 22:02.112
Our position is 41.12 North.

22:02.195 --> 22:04.072
71.52 West.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.908
It's a 22 foot... [dialogue fades]

22:18.795 --> 22:20.797
[Rogers]
I think we got everything we need, guys.

22:21.256 --> 22:23.508
You know,
if he was wearing a life jacket,

22:23.592 --> 22:26.344
there's a chance the Coast Guard
will find him...

22:26.428 --> 22:29.723
but it's important to be prepared
for the worst.

22:30.098 --> 22:32.726
This time of year,
someone your dad's age...

22:33.226 --> 22:36.521
every hour that goes by,
the odds get worse.

22:41.276 --> 22:42.527
That's it?

22:42.986 --> 22:46.531
[Rogers] It's in the Coast Guard's hands,
we'll keep you up to speed.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.366
Wait, so no one's coming
from the mainland

22:48.450 --> 22:50.994
to take crime scene photos
or take evidence, or...

22:51.078 --> 22:52.245
anything like that?

22:52.329 --> 22:54.247
It's not really necessary in this case.

22:55.582 --> 22:58.502
There's no reason to believe
there was foul play.

22:59.336 --> 23:00.796
[Harry] Are you kidding?

23:00.879 --> 23:04.091
Harry... if he had a few drinks,
hit a little rough water--

23:04.174 --> 23:05.175
He wasn't drunk.

23:05.258 --> 23:07.385
[Rogers]
Even sober, big enough waves--

23:07.469 --> 23:09.304
-Are you fucking kidding me?
-Harry.

23:10.680 --> 23:13.016
The place was ransacked.
Somebody did this.

23:13.433 --> 23:17.270
Nothing was taken. His poles
are still here, that new radio...

23:17.354 --> 23:19.022
[Harry] The radio's busted.

23:19.106 --> 23:20.565
Not when we checked.

23:21.274 --> 23:25.445
We're doing all we can, Harry,
I promise.

23:26.363 --> 23:28.031
But I know your dad.

23:28.907 --> 23:33.578
This isn't the first time he had
an accident drinking on his boat alone.

23:36.081 --> 23:38.834
I'm sorry, guys.
I really am.

23:39.876 --> 23:41.503
Tom was a good guy.

23:43.880 --> 23:46.258
They'll keep searching 'til morning.

23:52.889 --> 23:55.725
This island ain't made of
of fuckin' saints, ya know that?

23:55.809 --> 23:59.020
Stop it. We're not going to get anywhere
with you flying off the handle.

23:59.104 --> 24:01.773
They don't even give a shit, Audry.
They're not going to do anything.

24:02.149 --> 24:04.151
They're glorified beach patrol.

24:05.694 --> 24:07.070
[Paul] You okay?

24:07.154 --> 24:08.488
I don't know.

24:08.905 --> 24:12.576
They searched the whole coast
and he's not out there...

24:13.743 --> 24:15.203
How's Harry taking it?

24:16.454 --> 24:18.248
He thinks someone attacked him.

24:20.667 --> 24:23.879
I think it's just how he copes
with something overwhelming.

24:25.797 --> 24:28.675
He wanted to sue the hospital
when my mom died.

24:30.051 --> 24:32.846
She smoked two packs a day,
got lung cancer,

24:32.929 --> 24:35.307
and Harry wanted to sue
her doctor.

24:38.226 --> 24:39.477
He gets paranoid.

24:41.188 --> 24:45.400
He just refuses to believe
the most obvious, simple answer is right.

24:48.236 --> 24:49.988
My dad drank too much...

24:51.615 --> 24:53.325
and it finally caught up to him.

25:24.773 --> 25:27.651
Hey, Harry!
I brought you food.

25:33.114 --> 25:34.282
Look at this.

25:35.033 --> 25:37.369
You've gotta hit someone pretty hard
to break one of these.

25:37.994 --> 25:39.621
It just doesn't make any sense.

25:39.704 --> 25:41.122
We gotta hire a private investigator.

25:41.206 --> 25:43.625
We gotta get divers out there
to check out the area.

25:43.708 --> 25:46.211
-Something happened to him.
-What do you expect to find?

25:47.087 --> 25:49.756
It's been almost 24 hours...
I know it's hard--

25:49.839 --> 25:51.007
No.

25:51.466 --> 25:52.968
I'm not giving up on him.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.054
Don't do this to yourself.

26:13.029 --> 26:16.157
[growling over radio]

26:37.929 --> 26:41.516
[growling continues over radio]

27:04.706 --> 27:06.124
[Paul] What are you doing here?

27:06.207 --> 27:07.917
Figured I could come help.

27:08.001 --> 27:09.794
No, you don't have to do that.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.379
It's a good distraction.

27:12.172 --> 27:13.465
[Paul] How's Emily doing?

27:14.758 --> 27:16.301
She's confused.

27:17.135 --> 27:18.970
I don't think she really gets it.

27:19.137 --> 27:20.221
[Paul] Yeah...

27:21.306 --> 27:25.602
Your brother stopped by the office
this morning, he seemed pretty out of it.

27:26.353 --> 27:27.854
Harry? Why?

27:27.937 --> 27:29.606
He wanted to borrow some gear.

27:29.689 --> 27:31.149
What gear?

27:32.067 --> 27:33.943
Scuba equipment?

27:34.694 --> 27:35.695
Jesus Christ.

27:35.779 --> 27:37.030
I'm sorry. I thought you knew.

27:37.113 --> 27:38.406
It's been 36 hours.

27:39.032 --> 27:42.160
I mean, if the Coast Guard can't find him,
what's Harry gonna do?

28:41.010 --> 28:43.722
[radio static]

28:50.729 --> 28:51.896
[growling over radio]

29:45.283 --> 29:46.826
Ah, fuck!

29:50.580 --> 29:52.040
[knocking at door]

29:52.499 --> 29:53.917
What's up?

29:54.125 --> 29:55.627
Hey, you all right?

29:56.377 --> 29:57.337
Yeah.

29:59.547 --> 30:01.007
I'm worried about you.

30:01.090 --> 30:02.342
Audry, I'm fine.

30:04.928 --> 30:06.638
[Audry] Jen's coming in a few days.

30:07.180 --> 30:10.433
Why? She hasn't even seen Dad
in like two years.

30:10.517 --> 30:11.684
She wants to help.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.729
She thinks we need to start getting
Dad's affairs in order.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.272
Give me a fucking break.

30:16.356 --> 30:19.651
I'm sorry, Harry.
I'm upset too.

30:20.735 --> 30:22.487
But we've got to work on the next steps.

30:24.155 --> 30:26.241
We can't be going crazy, or...

30:26.866 --> 30:28.034
I don't know...

30:30.453 --> 30:32.330
I just don't want to see you go off
the deep end again.

30:32.413 --> 30:34.123
We don't even know what happened yet.

30:34.207 --> 30:36.167
I'm not gonna bury
an empty box.

31:38.271 --> 31:39.814
[coroner] We're ready for you.

31:48.031 --> 31:49.407
That's him.

31:49.657 --> 31:51.284
[coroner] Do you need a minute alone?

31:52.577 --> 31:54.120
How did this happen?

31:55.330 --> 31:57.206
We're still figuring that out.

31:57.290 --> 31:59.459
-[Audry] We don't need to do this now.
-[Harry] No, I want to know.

31:59.542 --> 32:02.462
All the bruises and shit on his face...
what did that to him?

32:03.338 --> 32:05.214
[coroner]
There is some head trauma...

32:05.298 --> 32:07.008
and lacerations on his face and body,

32:07.091 --> 32:11.429
which could have been caused by rocks
in the water. It's hard to say.

32:11.512 --> 32:12.972
What do you mean, "hard to say"?

32:14.474 --> 32:16.476
Head trauma can be pretty tricky.

32:17.101 --> 32:19.354
The head often times gets bumped around
in the water

32:19.437 --> 32:22.982
and bleeds whether or not
the person is, um...

32:24.108 --> 32:25.818
alive or dead.

32:27.487 --> 32:30.365
So, uh... rocks?

32:31.199 --> 32:33.701
He just--
He bumped into some rocks?

32:35.370 --> 32:37.455
[coroner]
There's no way of knowing, really.

33:10.154 --> 33:11.447
[Gerry] Hey, man.

33:13.700 --> 33:15.743
It's really fucked up what happened
to your dad.

33:16.703 --> 33:19.706
-I can't believe...
-I really don't wanna talk about it.

33:23.209 --> 33:25.336
Hey, you should talk to Dale.
He knows what's going on--

33:25.420 --> 33:28.548
-I don't want to talk to Dale.
-No, hey, Dale! Dale!

33:28.631 --> 33:29.757
-[Dale] Huh?
-Fuck...

33:29.841 --> 33:31.217
Hey, Harry!
Hold on. Thank you.

33:31.300 --> 33:32.385
Hey, Harry, hold on.
Stay right there. Hold on.

33:32.468 --> 33:33.678
I gotta talk to you about something.
Hold on.

33:33.761 --> 33:35.263
Hey, I've gotta get out of here, man.

33:35.346 --> 33:37.682
I owe you that fifty bucks...
[indistinct rambling]

33:37.765 --> 33:39.434
Hey, Harry, I've gotta talk to you about
something real quick.

33:39.517 --> 33:42.020
Ah, shit, Dale, you know,
I'm just on my way out.

33:42.103 --> 33:44.355
No, It's about your dad,
I think I'm on to something.

33:44.439 --> 33:46.566
Hey, can I get a ride? Fuck.

33:57.410 --> 33:58.953
How you holding up?

34:00.580 --> 34:01.873
Not great.

34:04.375 --> 34:06.669
Lot of strange activity lately, man.

34:07.754 --> 34:09.505
You hear about all them dead fish?

34:09.589 --> 34:10.590
Mm-hmm.

34:11.799 --> 34:13.801
What about Andy Gould's catch
a few weeks back?

34:15.178 --> 34:16.554
Dead fish?

34:17.805 --> 34:20.641
Birds... couple dozen of them.

34:22.393 --> 34:23.352
Oh, yeah?

34:24.312 --> 34:26.981
Yeah. Same thing happened in Arkansas
about three years ago.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.901
Five thousand birds dropped
out of the sky, dead.

34:30.276 --> 34:31.110
[chuckles]

34:31.778 --> 34:32.987
Nobody knew what happened to 'em.

34:33.613 --> 34:34.906
Where'd you read this?

34:36.657 --> 34:38.701
You wanna know the weirdest thing?

34:40.953 --> 34:43.331
Apparently they died before they
hit the ground.

34:45.917 --> 34:48.544
Like there was some kind of physical
trauma in the air.

34:48.628 --> 34:50.463
-Where did you read this shit?
-It happened!

34:50.546 --> 34:52.965
In The Journal, Times,

34:53.049 --> 34:56.094
about a billion websites, man.
Look it up! Shit.

34:56.511 --> 34:57.887
It's happening all over.

34:58.262 --> 35:01.599
Not just Arkansas,
not just here either.

35:01.682 --> 35:04.519
Sweden, Norway, Germany, Brazil...

35:16.489 --> 35:18.825
Did your buddy report those dead birds?

35:20.118 --> 35:21.994
To who? The government?

35:23.454 --> 35:25.998
Risk getting put on some fuckin' list
for the rest of his life?

35:26.082 --> 35:27.125
Are you kidding me?

35:27.375 --> 35:29.752
It's probably the government that's doing
this shit anyway.

35:30.336 --> 35:34.549
You and I should sit down
sometime and talk. Honestly.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.343
It's all connected.

35:38.469 --> 35:42.223
Dead birds in the water.
Dead fish in the water.

35:46.727 --> 35:48.271
Your dad in the water.

36:04.036 --> 36:05.204
Talk soon.

37:37.338 --> 37:39.006
[growling]

37:51.811 --> 37:52.853
Ugh...

38:03.072 --> 38:04.949
[Audry] I think we should give
Harry the house...

38:05.825 --> 38:08.452
[Jen]
Jesus, Audry. He can move.

38:11.414 --> 38:16.168
Seriously. He can get a one bedroom
apartment in Cranston for 800 bucks.

38:16.711 --> 38:18.337
[Audry] He's not going to know anyone.

38:18.421 --> 38:20.089
[Jen] You think he knows anyone here?

38:20.548 --> 38:22.717
He knew Dad. Period.

38:23.175 --> 38:25.094
It's all millionaires during the summer,

38:25.177 --> 38:27.013
yokels and crazy people
all year round.

38:27.096 --> 38:28.806
[Audry] What's he going to do
on the mainland?

38:29.223 --> 38:32.685
Flip burgers, mop floors.
What's he going to do here?

38:32.768 --> 38:35.563
Would you rather him spend the winter
rattling around Dad's house

38:35.646 --> 38:37.398
and drinking himself to death?

38:38.024 --> 38:40.735
Harry's an adult, and has to
start acting like one.

38:42.987 --> 38:44.655
-[Jen] Hey, Har...
-Hi.

38:44.989 --> 38:46.449
[Jen] How you holding up?

38:50.995 --> 38:53.247
So... how are plans coming along?

38:53.706 --> 38:56.208
We're gonna do the collation
at McCabe's...

38:56.375 --> 38:58.627
I'm sure Dad would be buried there
if they let him.

38:58.711 --> 38:59.754
They don't have a kitchen, so...

38:59.837 --> 39:02.131
one of us will have to go to the store
and pick up some food.

39:02.214 --> 39:04.467
I wouldn't be surprised
if half the island shows up.

39:04.550 --> 39:06.969
[Jen] Man, I'm gonna need a stiff drink
after that...

39:08.429 --> 39:11.015
You know, we're not all crazy around here.

39:13.642 --> 39:15.061
[Jen] What?

39:15.144 --> 39:18.064
I-- I know that.

39:31.869 --> 39:35.164
[indistinct chatter]

39:44.924 --> 39:46.801
[indistinct chatter continues]

39:46.884 --> 39:48.386
I'm so sorry.

40:00.022 --> 40:02.942
[growling]

40:22.795 --> 40:25.172
[growling grows louder]

40:26.966 --> 40:28.134
-[growling continues]
-[woman] You must be Harry.

40:28.217 --> 40:29.844
I'm so sorry for your loss.

40:32.555 --> 40:34.390
I work with Jen.

40:35.015 --> 40:35.975
Okay.

40:36.058 --> 40:37.268
She said you worked
with your dad,

40:37.351 --> 40:38.769
-you two must have--
-I have to go.

40:58.956 --> 41:00.332
[Dale] How you holding up?

41:02.585 --> 41:04.128
I'm going out of my mind.

41:06.046 --> 41:09.467
I gotta make small talk with a bunch of
fucking people I don't even know.

41:09.550 --> 41:12.136
Make them feel better because they met
my dad a couple times.

41:12.219 --> 41:13.637
He's my fucking dad.

41:18.058 --> 41:19.602
Who the fuck are these people?

41:21.395 --> 41:22.771
[Dale] Why the closed casket?

41:24.273 --> 41:26.025
[Harry] Wasn't my decision.

41:26.192 --> 41:30.404
Yeah, so the mortician was telling me
that your dad came in

41:30.488 --> 41:32.239
and he wasn't
looking all right?

41:33.282 --> 41:35.534
Like something might've happened to him
out there...

41:38.329 --> 41:42.833
Either way... sorry for your loss, man.

42:20.371 --> 42:21.497
What can I get for you?

42:22.122 --> 42:23.541
Do you have any platters?

42:23.624 --> 42:25.000
[deli clerk]
What'd you have in mind?

42:26.043 --> 42:30.214
Uh... ham? Cheese?

42:30.839 --> 42:32.174
[deli clerk] Give me a sec.

43:01.328 --> 43:04.206
[growling]

43:08.043 --> 43:10.504
[deli clerk's voice echoes]
How much ham do you want?

43:11.922 --> 43:13.382
Sir?

43:17.553 --> 43:18.470
[growling]

43:18.554 --> 43:19.972
How much do you want?

43:23.517 --> 43:25.019
All of it.

43:42.077 --> 43:43.621
[distorted]
What are you feeding? The whole orphanage?

43:44.997 --> 43:47.082
Hey. Hey!

43:50.002 --> 43:52.338
Hey, buddy! Where are you going?

43:52.421 --> 43:54.006
You've got to pay for that.

43:54.089 --> 43:55.466
[indistinct]

43:56.675 --> 43:57.676
What the hell, man?

43:57.760 --> 43:58.719
Come on.

44:00.929 --> 44:02.514
What's your problem?

44:05.976 --> 44:07.186
I'm sorry.

44:08.854 --> 44:10.481
[worker] Where are you going?
You can't just leave this here.

44:10.564 --> 44:12.191
Come on. Are you kidding me?
Hey...

44:15.944 --> 44:17.154
Hey!

44:18.989 --> 44:20.366
Where are you going?

44:36.465 --> 44:37.466
[Jen] Hey.

44:39.927 --> 44:41.845
What's going on? Where's the food?

44:43.847 --> 44:46.600
-I don't have it.
-Are you kidding me?

44:54.274 --> 44:56.318
You got any Advil back there?

44:57.194 --> 44:58.487
[bartender] Headache?

44:59.405 --> 45:01.532
I don't know, something like that.

45:03.117 --> 45:04.576
Can I get a shot with it?

45:12.000 --> 45:13.252
Can I get another one?

45:14.670 --> 45:16.463
[Audry] Where's the food?
People are starving.

45:16.547 --> 45:17.756
[Jen] He didn't get it.

45:17.840 --> 45:19.675
I don't know what the hell is going on
with him.

45:19.758 --> 45:21.927
He acts like he's the only person
who's affected here.

45:23.762 --> 45:27.099
[Ned] Nobody had no reason to hurt him.
I mean, it was just a freak accident.

45:27.182 --> 45:29.143
[Steve] No reason?
He's got that big ole house with the view.

45:29.226 --> 45:31.395
It's got to be worth at least a couple
million these days.

45:31.478 --> 45:32.855
You're telling me Harry had nothing to
gain from this?

45:33.981 --> 45:36.442
That's right, I'm talking about you,
you piece of shit.

45:36.525 --> 45:37.568
What are you saying?

45:37.651 --> 45:39.236
What's it like living in that house
all by yourself?

45:39.319 --> 45:41.363
Why don't you
shut your fucking mouth, Steve.

45:41.447 --> 45:43.991
Your pa gave you everything, and you throw
him in the water like a fucking stone.

45:44.950 --> 45:45.868
What's going on?

45:48.579 --> 45:50.164
[Harry] Get the fuck off of me!

45:56.795 --> 45:57.963
You calm?

46:02.176 --> 46:03.969
-Come on, Harry.
-[Harry] Yeah.

46:05.095 --> 46:06.555
All right.

46:10.934 --> 46:13.312
[indistinct chatter over walkie talkie]

46:14.688 --> 46:17.274
Steve wanted to press charges,
but I talked to him.

46:17.357 --> 46:19.818
Oh, come on.
You should've heard that old shit--

46:19.902 --> 46:21.445
All right, Harry. It's settled.

46:22.070 --> 46:24.448
Now, you've gotta call Ned
and apologize.

46:24.531 --> 46:26.658
You nearly
broke the guy's nose.

46:28.785 --> 46:29.620
Fine.

46:32.122 --> 46:34.041
Your sister's out front.

46:35.250 --> 46:36.627
Which one?

46:36.919 --> 46:38.253
The nice one.

46:47.221 --> 46:48.889
[officer] Couldn't find an ashtray?

46:52.768 --> 46:54.061
Be good!

47:04.154 --> 47:05.197
It's not my fault.

47:05.280 --> 47:07.157
-It was Dad's funeral, Harry.
-He started it.

47:07.241 --> 47:09.326
It was Dad's funeral.

47:14.706 --> 47:15.874
I'm sorry.

47:19.211 --> 47:22.172
Meredith Gibson invited us over
for dinner tonight.

47:24.299 --> 47:25.551
[Harry] Okay.

47:26.093 --> 47:28.178
You can come,
but you have to behave yourself.

47:28.262 --> 47:30.430
-Oh, give me a break, Audry.
-Jen didn't even want you to be there.

47:30.514 --> 47:31.682
Then I won't fucking go.

47:31.765 --> 47:33.058
I don't blame her.

47:35.769 --> 47:37.104
She's upset.

47:39.439 --> 47:42.276
Steve accused me of killing Dad.

47:44.528 --> 47:45.612
What?

47:46.697 --> 47:48.782
He said I wanted the house.

47:52.995 --> 47:54.246
He said that?

47:56.039 --> 47:58.542
Some guys deserve a black eye
every once in a while.

48:01.211 --> 48:02.504
[Audry] Jesus...

48:06.550 --> 48:07.968
I'm sorry.

48:10.971 --> 48:12.306
Yeah, me too.

48:14.308 --> 48:15.267
[sighs]

48:16.393 --> 48:19.938
[ominous music]

49:01.355 --> 49:03.565
[floor creaking]

49:18.955 --> 49:21.958
[clattering]

50:12.467 --> 50:15.053
[ominous music]

50:42.706 --> 50:44.040
What the fuck, Harry?

50:44.666 --> 50:45.876
What's going on?

50:45.959 --> 50:49.004
The place is a mess,
how much did you drink last night?

50:49.212 --> 50:50.464
I didn't.

50:50.881 --> 50:52.883
Most people throw their beer bottles
in the trash...

50:52.966 --> 50:54.801
-I didn't fucking do anything!
-...not smash it on the floor.

50:54.885 --> 50:57.637
This was Mom and Dad's house, okay?
It's not a dump!

51:03.727 --> 51:06.396
[growling]

51:11.860 --> 51:13.779
When is she going back to New York?

51:13.987 --> 51:15.113
Tonight.

51:15.197 --> 51:16.448
Thank Christ.

51:19.409 --> 51:21.661
She gets to be pissed off
when you pull shit like this.

51:21.745 --> 51:23.163
Yeah, okay.

51:26.958 --> 51:28.084
Ya know, before Mom died,

51:28.168 --> 51:31.338
she told me she spent her whole life
trying to help us get along.

51:32.339 --> 51:35.759
She begged me not to let it all
fall apart after she was gone.

51:39.095 --> 51:40.597
Stop picking fights with Jen.

51:50.148 --> 51:53.944
[ominous music]

51:59.407 --> 52:00.659
Woah.

52:01.076 --> 52:03.203
Hey, guys! Over here!

52:06.498 --> 52:08.333
[girl] There's like thirty of 'em.

52:08.667 --> 52:11.378
[boy] All their heads
were, like, smashed in.

52:17.050 --> 52:18.301
Jeez.

52:29.145 --> 52:31.982
[Jen] Your grandpa let your Uncle Harry
get away with anything.

52:33.149 --> 52:34.818
When I was having a bad day at school,

52:35.235 --> 52:38.446
he'd come and he'd take me out,
Grandma had no clue.

52:39.155 --> 52:40.615
[Audry] Don't get any ideas...

52:41.324 --> 52:43.702
Uncle Harry's lucky
he was the favorite.

52:43.785 --> 52:45.662
Grandpa never did that
with me.

52:45.871 --> 52:47.414
You would've ratted him out.

52:47.497 --> 52:48.540
[laughing]

52:48.874 --> 52:50.292
Where would you go?

52:51.293 --> 52:53.461
We would just jump on the boat

52:53.545 --> 52:55.088
and cruise around the coast.

52:55.881 --> 52:57.674
Sometimes we'd go exploring.

52:58.133 --> 53:00.176
Sakonnet, Nantucket...

53:00.260 --> 53:02.804
Hey, we should get going if you're gonna
make that ferry.

53:02.888 --> 53:04.306
-Okay.
-You need a lift?

53:04.389 --> 53:06.433
-I can take her.
-I don't mind.

53:07.767 --> 53:10.562
Um... okay.

53:28.288 --> 53:31.166
Listen, I, uh...

53:33.001 --> 53:35.211
I'm sorry that things
have been...

53:36.171 --> 53:39.591
weird or whatever between us.

53:42.594 --> 53:44.930
I just... I haven't been myself.

53:46.306 --> 53:47.807
He was my best friend, ya know?

53:47.891 --> 53:50.352
And, uh, I didn't
have many friends growing up,

53:50.435 --> 53:52.145
I don't have many now.

53:54.147 --> 53:55.815
So he was all I had.

53:58.318 --> 53:59.486
I'm sorry too.

54:00.946 --> 54:03.531
But we all just want what's best for you.

54:05.158 --> 54:06.201
Yeah.

54:06.326 --> 54:07.786
[Jen] Especially Audry...

54:09.037 --> 54:10.997
Don't take advantage of her, okay?

54:11.081 --> 54:12.999
She's got her own kid
to worry about.

54:13.083 --> 54:14.876
Yeah, you should probably get going.

54:18.672 --> 54:20.090
I love you, Harry.

54:21.091 --> 54:24.928
It's just...
It's time to take control of your life.

54:26.012 --> 54:27.806
Take care of yourself.

54:40.986 --> 54:42.320
See you soon?

54:44.072 --> 54:45.907
Yeah, I'll see you at the next funeral.

55:18.148 --> 55:19.149
Hey.

55:20.567 --> 55:22.110
[horn honking]

55:22.235 --> 55:23.236
Hey!

55:27.490 --> 55:30.869
[radio static]

55:46.009 --> 55:47.886
Deer.

55:51.222 --> 55:53.433
Deer.

55:55.935 --> 55:57.896
Deer.

55:59.689 --> 56:01.524
Deer.

56:03.234 --> 56:04.652
Deer.

56:04.736 --> 56:05.737
[growling]

56:06.112 --> 56:07.280
Deer.

57:31.197 --> 57:32.031
Yeah?

57:33.533 --> 57:35.452
You want to tell me what happened
to your truck?

57:42.375 --> 57:44.252
Hey, what's going on?

57:44.752 --> 57:47.714
[officer] Harry's truck's all smashed up.
There's blood on the grille.

57:47.797 --> 57:49.215
Jesus. What'd you hit?

57:49.299 --> 57:50.758
[Harry] I don't-- A deer.

57:50.842 --> 57:52.677
How many beers did you have
last night, Harry?

57:52.760 --> 57:53.845
I wasn't drunk.

57:54.846 --> 57:57.056
If I find you tooling around and drinking
in that thing,

57:57.140 --> 58:00.018
I'm going to take you to the ACI myself,
you understand?

58:00.101 --> 58:02.896
I don't care that you're going through a
rough time because your father's dead--

58:02.979 --> 58:04.856
-Okay, take it easy...
-I'm not gonna let you kill someone

58:04.939 --> 58:07.358
-in that truck.
-Loud and clear. Anything else?

58:08.776 --> 58:10.570
You better keep an eye on him.

58:19.329 --> 58:22.248
Why didn't you tell me
you hit a deer, Harry?

58:22.332 --> 58:24.042
I don't remember what happened.

58:24.584 --> 58:26.169
-[Audry] Were you drunk?
-No.

58:26.252 --> 58:27.879
-[Audry] Harry.
-No...

58:29.088 --> 58:30.340
I wasn't.

58:38.306 --> 58:40.600
I don't know what the fuck
is happening to me.

58:44.395 --> 58:45.855
Tell me what's going on.

58:48.650 --> 58:51.611
It's all my fault.
It's all my fucking fault.

58:56.950 --> 58:58.743
He was losing his mind.

59:04.165 --> 59:06.000
I don't know if it was dementia.

59:06.334 --> 59:09.295
I don't know if he was just going
fucking crazy or what,

59:09.379 --> 59:12.215
but he'd be so confused,
he'd just black out.

59:12.799 --> 59:15.218
And then I tried to get him to go
to the doctor, but he wouldn't do it.

59:16.261 --> 59:18.513
And then he wouldn't let me
tell anybody.

59:19.722 --> 59:21.683
[Audry] It's okay, Harry.
It's not your fault.

59:21.766 --> 59:23.601
Audry, nobody knew.

59:23.935 --> 59:26.396
And then he gets on the fucking boat and
he drowns.

59:26.479 --> 59:29.023
So, yeah. I should've done something.
I should've told somebody.

59:29.107 --> 59:30.775
Stop... stop.

59:40.660 --> 59:42.328
It's happening to me, Audry.

59:46.124 --> 59:47.542
I'm blacking out.

59:48.710 --> 59:50.712
[sighs] I'm getting confused.

59:52.589 --> 59:54.382
I lose minutes,
I lose hours...

59:54.465 --> 59:56.301
Are you forgetting things?

1:00:01.514 --> 1:00:04.142
I was driving home last night,
and I see this fucking deer...

1:00:06.019 --> 1:00:09.355
and then I wake up and I'm on the boat,
in the middle of the fucking sound.

1:00:09.439 --> 1:00:10.857
You're sleepwalking.

1:00:18.281 --> 1:00:19.532
I'm scared.

1:00:44.515 --> 1:00:46.726
[nurse]
I need you to memorize these three words:

1:00:46.809 --> 1:00:49.228
potato, dumpling, porcupine.

1:00:50.605 --> 1:00:51.481
What?

1:00:53.608 --> 1:00:56.027
Potato, dumpling, porcupine.

1:00:56.903 --> 1:00:58.571
Can you memorize those?

1:00:58.821 --> 1:01:00.323
What am I four years old?

1:01:00.698 --> 1:01:02.241
Just keep those in your head.

1:01:07.246 --> 1:01:11.167
Now, draw a clock inside the circle.

1:01:13.628 --> 1:01:14.837
Okay.

1:01:15.254 --> 1:01:18.132
[indistinct chatter over PA]

1:01:33.439 --> 1:01:34.649
[nurse] That's very good.

1:01:35.483 --> 1:01:37.735
Yeah, well, I'm not an idiot, so...

1:01:38.528 --> 1:01:40.697
Can you repeat those three words for me?

1:01:45.034 --> 1:01:47.370
Is this a test to see if I'm crazy?

1:02:01.426 --> 1:02:03.136
It's a little tight in here.

1:02:03.511 --> 1:02:05.012
[MRI tech] Hold still please.

1:02:14.939 --> 1:02:17.483
-[growling]
-[machine beeping]

1:02:18.609 --> 1:02:20.653
[growling grows louder]

1:02:29.662 --> 1:02:31.914
[growling continues]

1:02:31.998 --> 1:02:33.207
[gasping]

1:02:33.291 --> 1:02:35.168
Hey! Get me out of here!

1:02:35.251 --> 1:02:37.545
Hey, get me the fuck out of here!
Get me out of here!

1:02:37.628 --> 1:02:39.005
Get me out of here!

1:02:53.060 --> 1:02:54.645
[Dr. Koch] Are you all right?

1:02:56.105 --> 1:02:57.815
Have you calmed down?

1:02:58.733 --> 1:03:00.985
It was like being microwaved
in a coffin in there.

1:03:01.819 --> 1:03:03.863
[Dr. Koch] It says here that you've
been getting headaches?

1:03:04.614 --> 1:03:06.616
Did you get them in the MRI?

1:03:07.492 --> 1:03:08.993
I couldn't even think.

1:03:09.535 --> 1:03:12.246
You live near the west bank
of Block Island, right?

1:03:12.330 --> 1:03:13.998
Near that new wind farm?

1:03:14.081 --> 1:03:15.208
[Harry] Yeah.

1:03:17.919 --> 1:03:19.712
I'd like you to talk to a friend of mine.

1:03:20.254 --> 1:03:22.256
He had similar issues a few years back.

1:03:22.340 --> 1:03:24.842
Headaches, fatigue, memory deficits...

1:03:24.926 --> 1:03:26.302
And what was wrong with him?

1:03:26.385 --> 1:03:32.016
It's rare, but I believe that he had
electromagnetic hypersensitivity...

1:03:33.226 --> 1:03:36.020
It means that your body doesn't
respond well to electronic waves.

1:03:36.103 --> 1:03:38.898
That they affect your brain.
Make you feel sick...

1:03:38.981 --> 1:03:40.483
Okay, how do you cure it?

1:03:40.566 --> 1:03:42.235
Well, there's not much known about it now,

1:03:42.318 --> 1:03:45.571
but my friend was able to get relief
by getting rid of all of his electronics

1:03:45.947 --> 1:03:48.282
and moving to an area
near West Greenwich.

1:03:48.658 --> 1:03:51.953
It's a sort of an electromagnetic
dead zone.

1:03:52.036 --> 1:03:54.497
Uh, yeah, I'm not moving to South County.

1:03:55.373 --> 1:03:57.542
I think it'd be a good idea
for you to write to him

1:03:57.625 --> 1:03:59.293
-and see if he has anything to say.
-Oh.

1:03:59.377 --> 1:04:02.088
-There's a chance that relocating--
-Well, you can forget it.

1:04:02.171 --> 1:04:03.631
Because, I'm not moving.

1:04:03.714 --> 1:04:06.843
They could take down their goddamn
turbines, I-- I was here first.

1:04:09.428 --> 1:04:11.055
[Audry] Can I get his information?

1:04:11.138 --> 1:04:12.807
His phone number or something?

1:04:13.224 --> 1:04:16.435
[Dr. Koch] He doesn't have a phone.
That's the thing...

1:04:16.769 --> 1:04:17.770
Right.

1:04:17.854 --> 1:04:20.940
I can give you his address if you'd like
to write him a letter.

1:04:21.899 --> 1:04:25.403
In the meantime, here's a prescription
for something mild.

1:04:25.486 --> 1:04:27.572
This should help him
with his anxiety.

1:04:28.281 --> 1:04:29.657
But no more drinking.

1:04:31.325 --> 1:04:32.785
Easier said than done.

1:04:33.411 --> 1:04:34.954
He's got to find a better way to cope.

1:04:37.623 --> 1:04:38.916
[cashier] Is that it?

1:04:50.553 --> 1:04:52.513
[chatter on TV]

1:04:54.307 --> 1:04:56.267
I hope she didn't drive you
too crazy.

1:04:56.350 --> 1:04:59.312
[Paul] No, no, she was easy.
Where's Harry?

1:05:00.396 --> 1:05:02.356
I don't know. It didn't go great.

1:05:02.440 --> 1:05:04.609
He went on a drive
to clear his head.

1:05:07.153 --> 1:05:09.697
Are you sure that's a good idea?

1:05:11.741 --> 1:05:12.825
No.

1:05:14.160 --> 1:05:15.453
I don't know.

1:05:15.536 --> 1:05:17.705
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do right now.

1:05:18.789 --> 1:05:20.416
[Paul] You know, I can stay...

1:05:21.584 --> 1:05:24.211
if you're, you know,
worried about him, or if you're...

1:05:24.712 --> 1:05:26.964
afraid he might do something.

1:05:27.965 --> 1:05:29.634
[Audry] He's not dangerous.

1:05:30.051 --> 1:05:33.512
He just seems a little... unstable.

1:05:35.473 --> 1:05:37.892
He's my brother, Paul.
He's not violent.

1:05:42.188 --> 1:05:43.898
[Paul] People change, Audry.

1:05:47.276 --> 1:05:48.819
[Audry] Not like that.

1:05:49.612 --> 1:05:52.281
I don't know, something traumatic
happens, and it can be like...

1:05:52.365 --> 1:05:57.078
the flip of a switch. You know?
Some underlying condition surfaces.

1:05:58.454 --> 1:06:01.332
Look, I'm just saying, you don't have to
do everything yourself, okay?

1:06:01.415 --> 1:06:03.668
Maybe it's time you consider
some serious help.

1:06:03.751 --> 1:06:05.211
Like what?

1:06:06.754 --> 1:06:10.633
Like, I don't know, they have
some really good programs at Madison.

1:06:10.758 --> 1:06:13.135
I'm not sending him
to a mental institution.

1:06:13.344 --> 1:06:16.389
[Paul] Okay, Audry, it's not some kind of
insane asylum, okay?

1:06:16.472 --> 1:06:17.807
It's just full-time care

1:06:17.890 --> 1:06:20.977
by people that are trained
to deal with someone like him...

1:06:22.478 --> 1:06:24.480
Is Uncle Harry crazy?

1:06:32.113 --> 1:06:33.364
I don't know.

1:06:51.007 --> 1:06:54.218
[ominous music]

1:07:16.073 --> 1:07:17.199
[Harry] Hello?

1:07:20.244 --> 1:07:21.328
Is someone in there?

1:07:25.082 --> 1:07:26.125
Hello?

1:07:28.044 --> 1:07:29.628
Hey, is somebody in there?

1:07:35.301 --> 1:07:36.552
Harry?

1:07:38.179 --> 1:07:39.597
What are you doing out here?

1:07:41.140 --> 1:07:42.391
Is this your stuff?

1:07:42.933 --> 1:07:44.101
Yeah.

1:07:44.185 --> 1:07:49.231
Hygrometers, barometers, a Geiger counter,
EMF reader, you name it, I got it.

1:07:50.691 --> 1:07:52.651
Is this the spot
where those birds dropped?

1:07:53.319 --> 1:07:56.572
Yeah. Somebody's got to keep an eye
on this place.

1:07:57.782 --> 1:07:59.200
[Harry] You find anything?

1:07:59.325 --> 1:08:02.745
Lotta strange data.
It's too soon to speculate though.

1:08:03.412 --> 1:08:05.039
What are you doing out here?

1:08:07.833 --> 1:08:09.293
I don't know.

1:08:11.754 --> 1:08:13.339
Something's wrong with me.

1:08:14.381 --> 1:08:15.508
[Dale] What do you mean?

1:08:17.426 --> 1:08:20.471
They got me going to all these doctors
and all this bullshit.

1:08:22.056 --> 1:08:23.390
But something's wrong.

1:08:24.475 --> 1:08:28.062
Something with the island.
You know it. I know it. I just...

1:08:28.729 --> 1:08:30.564
I want to get to the bottom of it.

1:08:32.817 --> 1:08:33.901
Come with me.

1:08:40.324 --> 1:08:43.702
This place has always been a hotbed
of activity, but this is new, man.

1:08:44.078 --> 1:08:46.205
I'm glad you're finally involved
in all this.

1:08:46.664 --> 1:08:49.834
I've been keeping tabs on this island
since I was a fucking teenager, man.

1:08:50.918 --> 1:08:52.378
Government testing...

1:08:52.461 --> 1:08:55.339
Paranormal activity,
interdimensional communications,

1:08:55.422 --> 1:08:57.049
you name it,
it's in that fucking file.

1:08:57.133 --> 1:08:59.135
Here look at this, just some light
reading for you. [laughs]

1:09:00.219 --> 1:09:01.512
What is all this?

1:09:01.595 --> 1:09:05.599
"This" are printouts of every website
that I could find...

1:09:05.683 --> 1:09:07.184
about paranormal activity

1:09:07.268 --> 1:09:10.437
before the government could get
their hands on it and redact it.

1:09:13.149 --> 1:09:14.191
Right.

1:09:14.275 --> 1:09:16.610
[Dale]
Weird world outside of this garage.

1:09:21.198 --> 1:09:22.992
Are you ready for the truth?

1:09:25.953 --> 1:09:27.955
Fucking crazy person.

1:09:47.349 --> 1:09:49.185
I just bought a six pack.

1:09:50.144 --> 1:09:52.354
You gotta go easy on the alcohol, Harry.

1:09:52.438 --> 1:09:54.523
-Dr. Koch said--
-I'm going to McCabe's.

1:09:54.607 --> 1:09:55.566
[Audry] Harry.

1:09:55.649 --> 1:09:56.483
What?

1:09:57.610 --> 1:10:00.863
Just go to bed, watch a movie
or something.

1:10:02.281 --> 1:10:03.824
You'll feel better.

1:10:14.752 --> 1:10:19.757
[dog barking]

What do you want?

1:10:48.118 --> 1:10:49.578
Dog.

1:10:51.830 --> 1:10:53.749
Dog.

Dog.

Dog.

1:11:53.559 --> 1:11:55.519

Dog.

[Harry coughing]

1:14:14.992 --> 1:14:18.078
[Harry vomiting]

1:15:14.801 --> 1:15:16.386
[Audry] I can't keep doing this.

1:15:16.970 --> 1:15:19.014
Shit is everywhere.

1:15:19.097 --> 1:15:22.267
It rained last night,
Harry, everything out there is ruined.

1:15:22.601 --> 1:15:23.644
I'm sorry.

1:15:23.727 --> 1:15:24.937
[Audry] Did you blackout?

1:15:25.020 --> 1:15:26.772
Do you even remember
what happened?

1:15:29.650 --> 1:15:31.443
I tried to make it stop.

1:15:31.944 --> 1:15:34.655
The Petersons' dog went missing
last night.

1:15:36.865 --> 1:15:38.700
Did you have something to do with that?

1:15:41.537 --> 1:15:43.080
I didn't do it.

1:15:52.965 --> 1:15:54.383
Are you sure?

1:16:00.847 --> 1:16:04.017
Emily's eaten.
She knows how to set up her bed.

1:16:04.101 --> 1:16:06.270
Just make sure Harry doesn't
burn the place down.

1:16:06.353 --> 1:16:07.271
Wait, where are you going?

1:16:07.354 --> 1:16:10.774
I need answers. I can't wait two weeks
to get some letter back from this guy.

1:16:10.857 --> 1:16:14.069
That's crazy, Audry, you don't even know
this guy. Just give him a call.

1:16:14.152 --> 1:16:16.071
-He doesn't have a phone.
-Then I'll go.

1:16:16.154 --> 1:16:18.115
No. Paul, I just need you to trust me
on this, okay?

1:16:18.198 --> 1:16:20.200
I need to be the one
asking the questions.

1:16:20.284 --> 1:16:21.660
[Paul]
Listen, just let me go for you.

1:16:21.743 --> 1:16:25.414
I don't want to see you get hurt
by some crazy guy living in the woods.

1:16:26.164 --> 1:16:28.542
You mean too much to me, okay?

1:16:29.793 --> 1:16:31.336
I can't have this conversation right now.

1:16:31.420 --> 1:16:33.589
-Audry.
-Listen, if you want to help,

1:16:33.672 --> 1:16:35.090
keep an eye on Emily.

1:16:35.173 --> 1:16:36.758
I've got to do this myself.

1:16:39.303 --> 1:16:40.470
Okay.

1:16:40.554 --> 1:16:42.347
[Audry]
I'll be back. Last ferry.

1:17:37.736 --> 1:17:39.112
[man] Can I help you?

1:17:41.281 --> 1:17:42.574
Are you Kurt?

1:17:44.034 --> 1:17:45.035
Who are you?

1:17:45.118 --> 1:17:47.245
I'm Audry.
Dr. Koch gave me your information.

1:17:47.329 --> 1:17:48.664
I was hoping to ask you
some questions.

1:17:48.747 --> 1:17:49.915
[Kurt] Take that off.

1:17:50.540 --> 1:17:51.708
I'm sorry, what?

1:17:52.084 --> 1:17:55.837
Your watch.
Is that a cell phone in your purse?

1:17:56.630 --> 1:17:57.464
Yeah.

1:17:58.507 --> 1:17:59.966
Put it in your car.

1:18:00.592 --> 1:18:01.677
Now!

1:18:02.094 --> 1:18:03.178
Okay.

1:18:15.524 --> 1:18:16.650
You coming?

1:18:16.733 --> 1:18:17.818
Yep.

1:18:23.490 --> 1:18:27.786
Walking in here with a cell phone is like
walking in here with a grenade.

1:18:27.869 --> 1:18:29.079
Don't you get it?

1:18:29.162 --> 1:18:31.206
I'm sorry, I should've realized.

1:18:32.582 --> 1:18:33.792
[Kurt] How's Annie?

1:18:34.584 --> 1:18:37.254
Dr. Koch? She's good.

1:18:37.671 --> 1:18:39.131
She still in Boston?

1:18:40.090 --> 1:18:41.633
Providence.

1:18:43.385 --> 1:18:46.513
I think my brother might be suffering
from your same affliction.

1:18:47.180 --> 1:18:49.474
-Electromagnetic--
-I ain't got that.

1:18:50.016 --> 1:18:51.101
No?

1:18:51.184 --> 1:18:53.770
I got a problem with electronics though,
that's for sure.

1:18:55.230 --> 1:18:56.982
I'm just trying to get a better
understanding--

1:18:57.065 --> 1:18:58.817
You want something stiffer than this?

1:19:01.361 --> 1:19:02.320
I'm okay.

1:19:02.404 --> 1:19:03.280
[Kurt] Come on.

1:19:04.948 --> 1:19:07.033
It ain't often I get company
out here.

1:19:09.578 --> 1:19:10.495
Listen...

1:19:12.038 --> 1:19:14.583
I'm sorry if your brother is getting...

1:19:15.250 --> 1:19:18.962
headaches and stuff from his cell phone
or whatever, but...

1:19:20.255 --> 1:19:22.841
-that ain't what I got.
-It's not just headaches.

1:19:23.717 --> 1:19:25.343
He's been having blackouts.

1:19:26.470 --> 1:19:28.680
He's been doing strange things.

1:19:29.890 --> 1:19:31.224
Loses track of time.

1:19:36.271 --> 1:19:37.898
When did all this start?

1:19:41.735 --> 1:19:43.570
[Paul] All right...

1:19:44.196 --> 1:19:48.366
My niece loves this one, Em.
I think you're gonna like it.

1:19:59.252 --> 1:20:01.338
[static from DVD player]

1:20:02.047 --> 1:20:04.800
[growling]

1:20:04.883 --> 1:20:06.134
I'll be in my... room.

1:20:06.218 --> 1:20:08.053
Well, it's not that bad, I promise.

1:20:08.428 --> 1:20:10.388
I just-- I just wanna shut my eyes.

1:20:10.472 --> 1:20:11.807
[Paul] Come on, man... give it a shot.

1:20:12.432 --> 1:20:14.017
Yeah, watch it with us.

1:20:28.698 --> 1:20:30.075
[Kurt] Where does he end up?

1:20:30.200 --> 1:20:33.036
-What do you mean?
-Is he drawn somewhere specifically?

1:20:34.412 --> 1:20:36.873
-I really don't know.
-What does he do during his blackouts?

1:20:36.957 --> 1:20:40.418
I don't know, he makes a mess,
trashes the place--

1:20:40.502 --> 1:20:44.381
What does he take?
Animals? Food?

1:20:46.341 --> 1:20:47.592
I'm not following you.

1:20:47.676 --> 1:20:49.177
[Kurt]
You've gotta get him away from there.

1:20:49.261 --> 1:20:53.223
They start small. Monitoring what we eat,
what we interact with.

1:20:53.306 --> 1:20:54.975
Pretty soon they want more.

1:20:56.768 --> 1:20:58.562
Pretty soon someone's gonna
end up hurt.

1:20:59.271 --> 1:21:00.689
[growling grows louder]

1:21:03.316 --> 1:21:05.110
[Paul]
Come on, this DVD's brand new.

1:21:07.487 --> 1:21:09.698
[growling continues]

1:21:14.744 --> 1:21:16.037
Shit.

1:21:18.331 --> 1:21:20.458
[growling continues]

1:21:23.879 --> 1:21:25.171
What's wrong?

1:21:25.630 --> 1:21:28.258
[Paul] I don't know, might be
like a scratched disk or something.

1:21:29.050 --> 1:21:30.385
Girl.

1:21:32.470 --> 1:21:33.930
Girl.

1:21:34.014 --> 1:21:35.265
They're communicating with him.

1:21:36.224 --> 1:21:39.686
They make you hallucinate,
see stuff that ain't there.

1:21:40.562 --> 1:21:42.147
Force your hand.

1:21:43.231 --> 1:21:46.067
Don't you understand?
He's their vessel now.

1:21:47.152 --> 1:21:47.986
Who?

1:21:50.989 --> 1:21:51.948
Them.

1:21:54.701 --> 1:21:55.911
Okay...

1:21:56.244 --> 1:21:58.121
-I should get going.
-No, they want something.

1:21:58.204 --> 1:21:59.164
What do they want?

1:21:59.706 --> 1:22:01.333
[Tom's distorted voice]
Girl.

1:22:02.584 --> 1:22:04.002
Girl.

1:22:05.420 --> 1:22:07.172
Girl.

1:22:08.590 --> 1:22:10.800
-Girl.
-What's wrong, Uncle Harry?

1:22:10.884 --> 1:22:12.344
Girl.

1:22:13.094 --> 1:22:14.804
-Girl.
-What's going on?

1:22:14.888 --> 1:22:17.474
-I gotta leave.
-Girl.

1:22:21.269 --> 1:22:24.022
Hey, hey! Harry. Come on, man!
You should really stay. You--

1:22:24.773 --> 1:22:25.732
Harry!

1:22:27.317 --> 1:22:29.527
Listen to me!
It's only gonna get worse.

1:22:29.611 --> 1:22:32.697
One day I catch myself bringing my cat
to a rendezvous.

1:22:32.781 --> 1:22:35.492
The next I've got a goddamn homeless
lady in the back of my fucking seat!

1:22:35.575 --> 1:22:37.953
-Let go of me.
-They wanna know what makes us tick, lady.

1:22:38.286 --> 1:22:41.206
They're going to rip you apart and
staple you back together again.

1:22:41.957 --> 1:22:45.627
No! You've gotta get your brother out
of there before he hurts somebody!

1:22:46.503 --> 1:22:50.382
Somebody's going to end up dead!
You hear me?

1:23:07.649 --> 1:23:10.235
[growling over radio]

1:23:28.545 --> 1:23:30.422
[Tom's voice]
Girl.

1:23:31.381 --> 1:23:36.219
-No, no, no, no, no, no!
-[Tom's voice] Girl.

1:23:36.302 --> 1:23:37.804
[Tom's voice]
Girl.

1:23:57.907 --> 1:24:00.160
[phone ringing]

1:24:00.702 --> 1:24:02.495
He just took off.

1:24:02.579 --> 1:24:05.123
I don't know, I didn't want
to leave Emily to go after him.

1:24:05.206 --> 1:24:07.333
I'm really, really sorry.

1:24:08.626 --> 1:24:09.919
Wait, what?

1:24:10.754 --> 1:24:11.588
What happened?

1:24:13.006 --> 1:24:15.091
Jesus, Audry,
I knew I should've gone with you.

1:24:15.175 --> 1:24:16.426
Did you call the police?

1:24:16.509 --> 1:24:19.888
No, no, I'm okay.
I'm on my way back.

1:24:21.347 --> 1:24:24.934
I just don't know what she was doing
sending me there, he's insane.

1:24:26.227 --> 1:24:29.606
The ferry doesn't leave for a while,
so, I'm gonna be late.

1:24:30.982 --> 1:24:32.567
Thanks for taking care of her.

1:24:41.326 --> 1:24:42.744
Are you all right?

1:24:46.956 --> 1:24:48.625
Oh, my God. [screams]

1:24:49.167 --> 1:24:50.168
Hey!

1:25:45.140 --> 1:25:47.100
[Emily screaming]

1:25:48.768 --> 1:25:49.686
Emily?

1:26:13.501 --> 1:26:14.586
Paul?

1:26:18.381 --> 1:26:19.257
Paul!

1:26:20.091 --> 1:26:22.302
Paul, where's Emily?

1:26:22.385 --> 1:26:24.095
[Emily screaming in the distance]

1:26:25.471 --> 1:26:26.639
Emily!

1:26:39.944 --> 1:26:41.154
Emily!

1:26:48.369 --> 1:26:50.246
Harry, what are you doing?

1:26:51.122 --> 1:26:52.332
Mom!

1:26:52.790 --> 1:26:53.666
Emily!

1:26:54.626 --> 1:26:56.544
Harry, turn this boat around.

1:26:57.754 --> 1:26:58.588
Harry.

1:26:59.214 --> 1:27:00.715
[growling]

1:27:00.798 --> 1:27:01.799
Harry!

1:27:09.098 --> 1:27:10.266
Harry, you've gotta stop--

1:27:45.176 --> 1:27:48.137
Mayday, mayday, mayday,
this is the Patty M.

1:27:48.221 --> 1:27:51.683
[growling over radio]

1:27:59.357 --> 1:28:00.191
Harry...

1:28:01.317 --> 1:28:02.485
Harry, no!

1:28:03.486 --> 1:28:04.862
Mom!

1:28:16.082 --> 1:28:17.667
Harry, stop!

1:28:18.543 --> 1:28:19.669
Harry, please!

1:28:22.839 --> 1:28:23.798
Harry, stop!

1:28:27.760 --> 1:28:30.680
[growling]

1:28:43.443 --> 1:28:46.863
-[growling continues]
-[radio static]

1:28:47.405 --> 1:28:49.157
Mom, what's happening?

1:29:10.386 --> 1:29:13.014
[creaking]

1:29:24.650 --> 1:29:28.488
[Emily and Audry screaming]

1:29:29.989 --> 1:29:30.990
[Emily] Mom!

1:29:37.955 --> 1:29:39.457
[screaming]

1:29:48.049 --> 1:29:49.383
[Audry screams]

1:29:50.551 --> 1:29:51.886
Mom!

1:29:58.226 --> 1:29:59.143
Emily!

1:30:00.645 --> 1:30:01.979
[Emily screaming]

1:30:04.190 --> 1:30:06.859
-It's gonna be okay.
-[Emily screaming]

1:30:13.699 --> 1:30:15.243
[Emily] Mom!

1:30:17.411 --> 1:30:18.871
Mom!

1:31:35.239 --> 1:31:36.324
Emily?

1:31:38.201 --> 1:31:39.744
It's okay, come here.

1:31:40.661 --> 1:31:41.746
Come on...

1:31:47.835 --> 1:31:49.587
You're okay. It's okay.

1:31:52.506 --> 1:31:53.674
You're okay.

1:31:54.717 --> 1:31:55.927
It's gonna be okay.

1:32:25.373 --> 1:32:27.625
[Audry] I know it's confusing.

1:32:28.292 --> 1:32:30.211
But most of the fish we take out
of the water

1:32:30.294 --> 1:32:32.880
we put right back in
just a few days later.

1:32:38.344 --> 1:32:39.845
We're learning about them.

1:32:43.391 --> 1:32:46.185
We're studying them
so we can get to know them better.

1:32:47.228 --> 1:32:49.021
So we can help them better.

1:33:01.909 --> 1:33:04.912
I know it sounds mean and scary...

1:33:09.667 --> 1:33:13.796
but by taking some brave fish out
of the water and learning about them...

1:33:17.133 --> 1:33:19.468
we can eventually help all the other fish.

1:33:22.263 --> 1:33:24.223
It's a good thing we're doing.

1:33:42.325 --> 1:33:43.576
[gasping]
