20:04.704 --> 20:07.079
I'll never cheat again.

20:07.081 --> 20:10.208
Except on diets.

20:13.338 --> 20:14.337
Okay,

20:14.339 --> 20:17.215
Here's how you really
skip a rock.

20:17.217 --> 20:19.800
Oh, I used to be so good
at this!

20:19.802 --> 20:21.719
Hey, where's bart?

20:21.721 --> 20:24.138
He said he had an appointment
every Thursday night

20:24.140 --> 20:26.015
From 7:00 to 9:00.

20:29.020 --> 20:31.687
Students, look to your left,
look to your right.

20:31.689 --> 20:34.607
Those are the people
you'll be cheating off of.
