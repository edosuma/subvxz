00:07.008 --> 00:09.800
In local news,
champion angler abe simpson

00:09.802 --> 00:11.468
Is retiring.

00:11.470 --> 00:13.303
Yes, it's o-fish-ial.

00:13.305 --> 00:16.306
After reeling in
his 20th fishing derby win,

00:16.308 --> 00:18.267
He's finally bowing trout.

00:18.269 --> 00:21.020
Later, stay tuna
for a sharking story

00:21.022 --> 00:23.063
About a local sturgeon
with a cod complex

00:23.065 --> 00:26.442
Who kills patients
just for the halibut.

00:26.444 --> 00:28.318
Abe, why retire now?

00:28.320 --> 00:32.322
Well, I want to go out
on my 20-year win streak

00:32.324 --> 00:36.160
And pass along my only
earthly talent to my son.

00:36.162 --> 00:37.995
Tomorrow he's gonna take over

00:37.997 --> 00:40.497
The simpson family
fishing dominance.

00:40.499 --> 00:43.042
To all you fish
out there watching,

00:43.044 --> 00:44.668
<i> He's a-comin' for ya!</i>

00:44.670 --> 00:47.713
Whoa. It's sexy
when you're on the local news

00:47.715 --> 00:48.797
For something not horrible.

00:48.799 --> 00:52.009
Those fish should be so scared.

00:52.011 --> 00:54.595
Oh, those fish
shouldn't be scared at all.

00:54.597 --> 00:56.805
I never win anything.

00:56.807 --> 00:59.892
Why does my dad think
I'll win this fishing contest?

00:59.894 --> 01:02.561
Maybe because all you have to do
is sit still

01:02.563 --> 01:03.771
And hold a stick.

01:03.773 --> 01:06.482
That's two things! [groans]

01:06.484 --> 01:08.484
[birds singing]

01:08.486 --> 01:10.486
[humming]

01:10.488 --> 01:11.779
[door opens]

01:11.781 --> 01:13.197
Principal skinner,
sorry to barge in,

01:13.199 --> 01:15.199
But I'm applying
to the most selective

01:15.201 --> 01:17.034
Kids' summer camp
in the country.

01:17.036 --> 01:19.787
They even reject the
silicon valley adderall kids.

01:19.789 --> 01:22.664
And, um, I was hoping
you'd write me

01:22.666 --> 01:23.916
A letter of recommendation.

01:23.918 --> 01:25.709
[chuckles]
recommendation letter?

01:25.711 --> 01:28.295
No one's ever asked me
to write one of those before.

01:28.297 --> 01:31.673
I've mainly just done letters
to judges requesting leniency.

01:31.675 --> 01:33.592
If I'm accepted into the
university of springfield camp,

01:33.594 --> 01:35.552
I'll be fast-tracked to get into

01:35.554 --> 01:37.429
The amherst middle school
summer workshop,

01:37.431 --> 01:38.597
Which is a feeder

01:38.599 --> 01:40.265
To the uc santa cruz
marine biology retreat,

01:40.267 --> 01:44.186
Which is a sure ticket into
the oberlin philosophy day camp

01:44.188 --> 01:46.021
With sleepover option.

01:46.023 --> 01:48.857
Well, I believe
my edu95 software bundle

01:48.859 --> 01:52.569
Did come
with a recommendation template.

01:52.571 --> 01:55.030
[whirring]

01:56.325 --> 02:00.702
Don't forget, I was
the classroom hamster monitor.

02:00.704 --> 02:03.872
And the art club
parliamentarian.

02:03.874 --> 02:05.624
And I chaired the fundraiser

02:05.626 --> 02:08.293
To get the lunch ladies
ethical hairnets. [chuckles]

02:08.295 --> 02:10.129
Got it.

02:10.131 --> 02:12.381
"many interests."

02:12.383 --> 02:13.799
And print.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.092
[whirring]

02:16.387 --> 02:18.470
[gasps]

02:21.433 --> 02:22.766
Never mind.

02:22.768 --> 02:25.060
â™ª

02:25.062 --> 02:28.063
Welcome to the annual
springfield fishing derby,

02:28.065 --> 02:30.065
Sponsored by duff camo.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.692
"the deer will never see
you're drunk."

02:31.694 --> 02:35.654
And now, the champion emeritus
will throw out

02:35.656 --> 02:38.323
The ceremonial first cast!

02:38.325 --> 02:40.576
[grunts]

02:41.662 --> 02:43.745
-[chuckles]
-[cheering]

02:43.747 --> 02:45.539
Dad, why do you think
I can do this?

02:45.541 --> 02:46.874
I never win anything.

02:46.876 --> 02:48.083
Oh, I don't believe in<i> you.</i>

02:48.085 --> 02:51.086
I'm banking on
the simpsons fishing gene.

02:51.088 --> 02:52.421
I'm finally gonna pass down
something

02:52.423 --> 02:55.257
Other than chronic hand hate.

02:56.177 --> 02:58.260
-[crying]
-oh!

02:59.430 --> 03:02.014
We're three hours
into this nail-biting,

03:02.016 --> 03:04.141
Intense competition, folks,

03:04.143 --> 03:06.894
Which means butt fatigue
is really setting in

03:06.896 --> 03:08.937
On these recumbent warriors.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.814
[groaning]

03:10.816 --> 03:13.192
[joints cracking]

03:15.529 --> 03:18.614
Aw, man, if I wanted
to watch dad sit and do nothing,

03:18.616 --> 03:20.282
I'd visit him at work.

03:20.284 --> 03:22.409
Mom, I bet
the other camp applicants

03:22.411 --> 03:24.870
Are volunteering
and accomplishing stuff.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.288
I'm just standing around here

03:26.290 --> 03:28.832
Getting a tan line
from my pearls!

03:28.834 --> 03:30.125
I'm sure you'll get in.

03:30.127 --> 03:32.127
You get into everything.

03:32.129 --> 03:34.796
I could pick up litter,
rescue driftwood,

03:34.798 --> 03:38.467
Make sure beavers aren't chewing
on washed-up mannequin arms.

03:39.428 --> 03:41.762
-[chittering angrily]
-[grunting]

03:41.764 --> 03:42.512
Oh...

03:42.598 --> 03:43.889
[quietly]
sorry, marge,

03:43.891 --> 03:45.766
But could you murmur
a little quieter?

03:45.768 --> 03:47.351
I'm trying to fish.

03:49.647 --> 03:50.520
Uh-oh.

03:51.482 --> 03:53.232
I got to let myself run
a little.

03:53.234 --> 03:55.359
Oh, oh, oh, oh! Oh! Oh!

03:55.361 --> 03:57.611
-Hmm.
-[homer groaning]

03:57.613 --> 03:59.238
[others laughing]

04:00.241 --> 04:01.615
Ah!

04:01.617 --> 04:03.450
[laughter]

04:05.788 --> 04:06.536
What the hell is that thing?!

04:06.538 --> 04:08.997
Get it out! Get it!

04:08.999 --> 04:10.791
Oh. Hey!

04:10.793 --> 04:11.875
-Homie!
-[bart whooping]

04:11.877 --> 04:15.545
The fish weight to beat
is 7.2 pounds.

04:15.547 --> 04:17.464
Will a heavier fish arise?

04:17.466 --> 04:19.466
<i>We'll find out right after this.</i>

04:19.468 --> 04:21.134
<i>When you're gutting your catch,</i>

04:21.136 --> 04:23.136
<i> Are you sick and tired</i>
<i> of being stared at</i>

04:23.138 --> 04:25.264
<i> By cold, accusing fish eyes?</i>

04:25.266 --> 04:26.556
<i> You need the happy hood.</i>

04:26.558 --> 04:30.519
<i> That's right, fish,</i>
<i> you'll love it!</i>

04:30.521 --> 04:32.396
<i> And don't forget to play</i>
<i> the happy hood mobile game.</i>

04:32.398 --> 04:35.899
Homer simpson's fish
comes in at...

04:35.901 --> 04:37.734
10.4 pounds.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.027
We have a winner!

04:39.029 --> 04:42.030
[crying]
I've never won anything before.

04:42.032 --> 04:43.532
What do I do?

04:43.534 --> 04:45.033
Uh...

04:49.790 --> 04:51.415
[chuckles]
oh, my gorgeous boy.

04:51.417 --> 04:54.084
I've never loved you more!

04:54.086 --> 04:56.128
Thanks, dad.

04:57.631 --> 05:02.384
I get to cook my husband's
prize-winning fish!

05:02.386 --> 05:05.679
The whole house
is gonna stink like victory!

05:10.394 --> 05:13.312
What? Is this
where marbles come from?

05:13.314 --> 05:15.314
Like pearls and lobsters?

05:15.316 --> 05:18.567
Uh, how did my slingshot marbles
get in there?

05:18.569 --> 05:23.030
You added weight to my fish
with marbles?!

05:23.032 --> 05:24.614
I-I couldn't help it!

05:24.616 --> 05:27.734
Watching you lose was so boring.

05:27.736 --> 05:30.871
So I didn't really win at all.

05:30.873 --> 05:32.122
You cheated!

05:32.124 --> 05:34.333
[grunting angrily]

05:36.378 --> 05:38.462
[sighs]
oh.

05:38.464 --> 05:40.213
Oh, my gorgeous boy,

05:40.215 --> 05:42.174
I've never loved you more!

05:47.264 --> 05:49.639
"the saga of the oregon trail,"

05:49.641 --> 05:51.933
A poem by milhouse van houten.

05:51.935 --> 05:54.394
"we started our journey
to the pacific

05:54.396 --> 05:59.274
Because we heard
that it was terrific."

05:59.276 --> 06:02.694
I'm here to take bart simpson
to his doctor's appointment.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.321
I have a doctor's appointment?

06:04.323 --> 06:06.615
Oh, yeah. Bunch of them.
You're really sick.

06:08.535 --> 06:13.246
"we made our first camp
when we were all ready.

06:13.248 --> 06:15.248
We made our first dinner,

06:15.250 --> 06:17.584
Meatballs and spaghetti."

06:20.214 --> 06:21.797
Uh, this isn't the way
to the doctor.

06:21.799 --> 06:23.965
[laughs]

06:23.967 --> 06:25.133
There's no doctor.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.968
So I'm not sick?

06:26.970 --> 06:29.137
I don't know.
Everybody's got something.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.765
You and me are going cheating.

06:31.767 --> 06:32.974
Huh?

06:32.976 --> 06:35.060
When your fish marbles
won me that contest,

06:35.062 --> 06:37.229
It was the greatest thrill
I ever had as a father.

06:37.231 --> 06:39.731
And I want
to feel that rush again.

06:43.487 --> 06:45.278
Uh, how do we cheat
at rock skipping?

06:45.280 --> 06:47.864
I don't know. Making a plan

06:47.866 --> 06:50.325
To cheat in advance
felt dishonest.

06:52.996 --> 06:55.080
-[whirring]
-[humming]

06:55.999 --> 06:58.250
Perfect.

06:58.252 --> 07:00.127

-[high-pitched humming]

07:01.130 --> 07:04.297
Ooh, a big envelope
from summer camp admissions!

07:04.299 --> 07:06.091
[singsongy]
I bet that's good news!

07:06.093 --> 07:09.094
Mom, that's my safety.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.637
Of course
I'm gonna get in there.

07:10.639 --> 07:13.098
Florida state's
a total party camp.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.225
Why haven't I heard yet?

07:15.227 --> 07:17.060
Janey got responses
from all her camps,

07:17.062 --> 07:18.478
Even her reaches.

07:18.480 --> 07:21.398
Her essay was about her
grandmother's immigrant story.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.608
-Uh-huh.
-She came from ottawa.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.152
That's barely an immigrant.

07:25.154 --> 07:26.528

<i> And the action's heating up.</i>

<i> But now it's time</i>

07:39.501 --> 07:42.169

the bottom of the barrel

For new sports content.

07:43.714 --> 07:46.465
Yeah, and barrel scraping

07:54.183 --> 07:56.850
That's not the famous
nike swoosh on his shoes

07:56.852 --> 07:59.644
But, rather,
leeches on his bare feet.

22 skips!

That's a throw worthy of
the late, great doink anderson!

08:11.366 --> 08:13.033
Interesting fact--
he left his widow nothing.

08:13.035 --> 08:15.660
Next up, homer simpson,

08:15.662 --> 08:19.247
A first-timer but using the same
equipment as these pros,

You can feel the scam
pulsing in your blood,

08:44.483 --> 08:46.399
Like snorting
lotto scratcher dust

08:46.401 --> 08:48.944
Or being elected king
of hamburger planet!

08:48.946 --> 08:52.656
You know, dad, all the times
I cheated on stuff before--

08:52.658 --> 08:54.783
School tests, covid tests--

08:54.785 --> 08:56.201
I always felt
kind of bad about it,

08:56.203 --> 09:00.580
But cheating with you
feels so right.

09:00.582 --> 09:02.123
Can we do it one more time?

09:02.125 --> 09:05.627

doing it.

10:19.453 --> 10:21.161
Why some dudes become dads
on purpose.

10:21.163 --> 10:24.289
This has been
the best week of my life.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.498
Me, too!

10:25.500 --> 10:27.417
And my life's not a barf-nado
like yours.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.546
Do you think
it's a little strange

10:31.548 --> 10:34.799
That your dad is suddenly
winning all these contests

10:34.801 --> 10:36.926
And giant prizes?

10:36.928 --> 10:39.262
Yeah, I've noticed
the same thing.

10:40.265 --> 10:42.599
I guess I just assumed
that sports in america

10:42.601 --> 10:44.392
Were getting much, much easier.

10:44.394 --> 10:45.560
[homer]
hey, honey.

10:45.562 --> 10:47.604
Do you want
this ladies' ghillie suit I won

10:47.606 --> 10:50.023
At the tobacco-spitting
competition?

10:50.025 --> 10:52.025
Homer, we need to talk.

10:52.027 --> 10:53.526
Oh, I like when we talk.

10:53.528 --> 10:56.237
I don't like
when we<i> need</i> to talk.

10:56.239 --> 10:58.031
You're sure winning
a lot of activities

10:58.033 --> 11:00.241
You've never even tried before.

11:00.243 --> 11:01.743
I'm sorry to ask this, but...

11:01.745 --> 11:03.286
Are you cheating?

11:04.998 --> 11:08.083
Oh, I can't lie to you.

11:08.085 --> 11:09.459
Wait, that's a lie.

11:09.461 --> 11:12.712
I can lie and I have,
but I'm not going to now.

11:12.714 --> 11:16.091
I<i> am</i> cheating,
but not for prizes or glory.

11:16.093 --> 11:18.259
Me and bart
are cheating together as a team.

11:18.261 --> 11:20.428
-It's our father-son thing.
-[electrical buzzing]

11:20.430 --> 11:23.056
[sighs] can't you do
something else with bart,

11:23.058 --> 11:25.350
Like coach his soccer team?

11:25.352 --> 11:27.477
Soccer? You mean bribing refs?

11:27.479 --> 11:28.311
Where's the challenge?

11:28.313 --> 11:29.354
That's not the kind of cheating

11:29.356 --> 11:32.148
That brings a dad
and his son closer.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.859
We have this special bond,
like lavar and lonzo ball

11:34.861 --> 11:38.196
Or cecil and prince fielder
before they became estranged.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.156
No, no, no, no, no, no.

11:40.158 --> 11:41.825
Cheating is wrong.

11:41.827 --> 11:44.953
Maybe you should find another
way to bond with your son,

11:44.955 --> 11:46.037
Like just being a good dad.

11:46.039 --> 11:49.457
Oh, where's the jet ski in that?

11:49.459 --> 11:50.166
[growls]

11:50.293 --> 11:51.960
Marge, you're always saying

11:51.962 --> 11:53.586
You want our kids to succeed.

11:53.588 --> 11:56.297
Then maybe not cheating
is cheating<i> them.</i>

11:57.801 --> 11:58.758
Hmm.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.260
Refresh.

12:00.262 --> 12:00.677
Nothing.

12:00.679 --> 12:02.637
Refresh.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.180
Still nothing.

12:04.182 --> 12:04.931
Refresh.
[gasps]

12:04.933 --> 12:06.725
Spinny rainbow!

12:06.727 --> 12:08.435
[gasps]
nothing.

12:08.437 --> 12:08.935
[doorbell rings]

12:08.937 --> 12:10.311
Lisa simpson,

12:10.313 --> 12:14.023
I'm here from the university
of springfield camp.

12:14.025 --> 12:16.067
And I'm very excited to tell you

12:16.069 --> 12:18.862
That you've been accepted
into our summer program.

12:18.864 --> 12:21.656
[gasps]
I got in?

12:21.658 --> 12:23.074
That's amazing! Oh!

12:23.076 --> 12:25.118
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

12:25.120 --> 12:29.122
It's so classy that you came
to tell everybody in person.

12:29.124 --> 12:31.416
As the rowing coach,
I like to personally welcome

12:31.418 --> 12:33.710
All the incoming members
of our camp rowing team.

12:33.712 --> 12:35.128
What? Rowing?

12:35.130 --> 12:38.256
Your application photos
were amazing.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.008
You can row anywhere
in the shell--

12:40.010 --> 12:42.594
Stroke, bow, powerhouse.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.763
Uh, what?

12:44.765 --> 12:46.681
-What?
-See you at camp.

12:46.683 --> 12:48.266
Here's your henley!

12:51.730 --> 12:53.563
[gasps]

12:54.775 --> 12:56.107
[gasps loudly]

12:57.235 --> 13:01.613
[gasps] someone put doctored
photos into my application!

13:01.615 --> 13:04.532
And I know who.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.326
â™ª

13:09.790 --> 13:10.789
[shrieks]

13:10.791 --> 13:12.749
You cheated.

13:12.751 --> 13:14.125
For me!

13:14.127 --> 13:16.628
What?! No, I didn't!

13:16.630 --> 13:18.546
Honey, what's the matter?

13:18.548 --> 13:21.299
Dad and bart put my head
on an olympic rower's body

13:21.301 --> 13:23.635
To cheat my way into camp!

13:23.637 --> 13:25.011
No, we didn't.
Why would we help someone

13:25.013 --> 13:26.846
Who's already good at things?

13:26.848 --> 13:28.348
Now shut up.
Dad's in the finals.

13:28.350 --> 13:31.601
He could win an electric truck
they converted back to gas.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.439
You've already cheated at
every dumb sport in the world!

13:36.441 --> 13:39.609
I bet you're cheating
at<i> this</i> dumb sport right now!

13:39.611 --> 13:41.569
[all gasp]

13:41.571 --> 13:42.862
[thud]

13:42.864 --> 13:43.905
[moleman]
ow, my foot.

13:43.907 --> 13:45.281
[quietly]
lisa, shh.

13:45.283 --> 13:48.743
A lot of these axe throwers
have guns in their cars.

13:48.745 --> 13:50.954
What are you afraid of,

13:50.956 --> 13:52.831
That they'll see...

13:52.833 --> 13:54.874
-This?
-[gasping]

13:54.876 --> 13:56.751
A magnet.

13:56.753 --> 13:57.961
If you was cheating at this,

13:57.963 --> 14:00.797
I bet you cheated
at all them other events

14:00.799 --> 14:03.633
You surprisingly
and illogically won.

14:03.635 --> 14:04.926
We were robbed!

14:04.928 --> 14:07.303
Of our prizes and our dignity!

14:07.305 --> 14:10.265
-[heavy metal music playing]
-get 'em!

14:10.267 --> 14:13.017
Stay back!
I'm a champion axe thrower!

14:13.019 --> 14:14.727
-[grunting]
-[thud]

14:14.729 --> 14:16.229
[moleman]
ow, my stump.

14:22.821 --> 14:24.904
Don't let them cheaters
get away!

14:24.906 --> 14:25.864
Look, guys,
you got us all wrong.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.782
We didn't cheat!

14:27.784 --> 14:31.369
[quietly] quick, get on the atvs
we won by cheating.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.829
[laughs]

14:32.831 --> 14:34.998
Looks like you just got cheated!

14:35.000 --> 14:37.250
Out of your revenge!

14:50.473 --> 14:52.223
[all sigh]

14:52.225 --> 14:55.226
If you think I'm not mad
anymore, you're wrong.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.729
While we were escaping,
I got even more mad!

14:57.731 --> 15:00.481
It's called multitasking.

15:00.483 --> 15:03.776
And it was one of the legitimate
skills on my application.

15:03.778 --> 15:06.237
Remember?
The one you cheated on?

15:06.239 --> 15:07.071
We didn't, I swear.

15:07.198 --> 15:10.033
-Cheater's honor.
-Oh, really?

15:10.035 --> 15:12.327
Well, if you didn't,
then who uploaded

15:12.329 --> 15:16.664
All those fake photos of me
rowing so I could get into camp?

15:16.666 --> 15:17.832
[marge]
I did.

15:17.834 --> 15:18.625
You?

15:18.627 --> 15:20.835
You?! No, no.

15:20.837 --> 15:22.462
It must've been me!

15:22.464 --> 15:24.130
No, it was me.

15:24.132 --> 15:26.382
But, marge, you're you.

15:26.384 --> 15:29.802
You're sweet, pure,
incorruptible.

15:29.804 --> 15:31.596
[gasps]
dad,

15:31.598 --> 15:33.798
We ruined mom.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.433
No! No!

15:35.435 --> 15:38.353
[retching]

15:41.900 --> 15:43.858
What have I done?

15:43.860 --> 15:46.527
Other than everything
I know that I did?

15:46.529 --> 15:48.029
Yes, I cheated.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.989
And you showed me how to do it.

15:49.991 --> 15:52.825
But not to win
a beef jerky dehydrator

15:52.827 --> 15:55.828
Or harley-davidson
beard shampoo.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.914
"if you want your kids
to succeed,

15:57.916 --> 16:00.750
Then not cheating
is cheating<i> them."</i>

16:00.752 --> 16:03.044
[retching]

16:03.046 --> 16:06.673
Mom, you also cheated me
out of the chance

16:06.675 --> 16:08.466
To get in on my own merits!

16:08.468 --> 16:10.760
I worked hard.

16:10.762 --> 16:12.470
I cleaned up the beach.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.930
I taught old people
how to email!

16:13.932 --> 16:18.851
I was working
with 72-point font!

16:18.853 --> 16:21.896
Oh, this is all our fault.

16:21.898 --> 16:23.773
Son, we made a terrible mistake.

16:23.775 --> 16:26.776
But we can learn and do better.

16:26.778 --> 16:30.613
Let's never, ever bond again.

16:30.615 --> 16:33.032
You're right. Never again.

16:33.034 --> 16:35.868
Promise me this is
the last time we hug.

16:35.870 --> 16:38.287
I swear, dad. I swear.

16:38.289 --> 16:38.955
There you is.

16:39.124 --> 16:40.957
We never would've found you

16:40.959 --> 16:42.583
If it weren't
for all that guilt vomiting

16:42.585 --> 16:44.794
We done heard.

16:44.796 --> 16:46.629
Go ahead. Kill me.

16:46.631 --> 16:48.089
Cleave my skull.

16:48.091 --> 16:50.258
I don't deserve to live
after corrupting

16:50.260 --> 16:52.593
The only good person
I've ever known.

16:52.595 --> 16:54.220
I don't know about that.

16:54.222 --> 16:56.889
We was just gonna rough you up
a little bit.

16:56.891 --> 16:58.725
Oh. Well, I mean, I...

16:58.727 --> 17:00.351
I guess we could kill you,

17:00.353 --> 17:03.062
But you probably need
to sign a waiver or something.

17:03.064 --> 17:05.273
[man]
nobody is killing anyone.

17:05.275 --> 17:06.899

[tires screech]

17:12.907 --> 17:16.993
You think we'll all stay friends
after this or just drift apart?

17:19.330 --> 17:22.165
Well, mm, drift apart it is.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.128
Aw, this is the camp
I wanted to go to.

17:27.130 --> 17:30.089
They must know
about the fake application.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.927
[chuckles]
welcome, simpsons!

17:34.929 --> 17:36.137
I hope you don't mind that I had

17:36.139 --> 17:38.097
The university of springfield
football team

17:38.099 --> 17:38.931
Bring you here.

17:38.933 --> 17:41.601
Um, I want to apologize

17:41.603 --> 17:43.061
For being party
to a false application.

17:43.063 --> 17:48.399
My mother and I need to have
"the talk" about honesty.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.234
Lisa, don't be mad
at your mother.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.862
It may surprise you to learn
that this institution has

17:52.864 --> 17:55.031
A proud tradition
of embracing cheating.

17:55.033 --> 17:59.535
After all, this is
university of springfield camp,

17:59.537 --> 18:01.954
Usc.

18:01.956 --> 18:04.832
Well... You're okay
with me cheating?

18:04.834 --> 18:07.919
Say it isn't so, dean belichick.

18:07.921 --> 18:10.088
You think your application
was the only one

18:10.090 --> 18:12.131
With embellishments?
Look at these.

18:12.133 --> 18:15.468
This ten-year-old claims
she performs open-heart surgery.

18:15.470 --> 18:17.845
This 12-year old said
it was her idea

18:17.847 --> 18:20.556
To use big fat straws
for boba tea.

18:20.558 --> 18:21.974
And you know what?

18:21.976 --> 18:24.393
[chuckles]
we let them all in.

18:24.395 --> 18:26.395
[lisa gasps]

18:26.397 --> 18:28.898
But I want
to live an ethical life!

18:28.900 --> 18:30.566
This is the world we live in.

18:30.568 --> 18:31.609
Taxpayers hide money
from the irs,

18:31.611 --> 18:33.861
Dating profiles
are nothing but lies,

18:33.863 --> 18:38.783
And right now the houston astros
are dreaming up ways to cheat

18:38.785 --> 18:40.368
That would blow your mind.

18:40.370 --> 18:42.495
[homer yelps]

18:42.497 --> 18:43.454
So, here at usc,

18:43.456 --> 18:44.664
We decided to<i> own</i> cheating

18:44.833 --> 18:48.459
And prepare our students
for the way the world is,

18:48.461 --> 18:50.878
Not the way
some would like it to be.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.171
What do you say, lisa?

18:52.173 --> 18:54.173
Will you accept
our most prestigious

18:54.175 --> 18:56.509
Lance armstrong
summer scholarship?

18:56.511 --> 18:58.803
Am I risking
everything I believe in

18:58.805 --> 19:01.347
By refusing to do something
I don't believe in?

19:01.349 --> 19:03.182
[sighs]

19:03.184 --> 19:05.101
I choose honesty.

19:05.103 --> 19:06.227
I'm proud of you, honey.

19:06.229 --> 19:09.313
Yep. Walking out the door.

19:09.315 --> 19:13.651
Leaving this room and this
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.694
[chuckles softly]

19:14.696 --> 19:16.529
Walking... Out.

19:21.619 --> 19:23.995

to give you a little push?

19:23.997 --> 19:25.496
Would you?

19:25.498 --> 19:27.165
[exhales]

19:27.167 --> 19:30.418
Let the rowing coach know
we're sorry she was lied to.

19:30.420 --> 19:31.252

19:31.254 --> 19:33.421
I think she may be used to it.

19:33.423 --> 19:34.797
Homer, a moment?

19:34.799 --> 19:38.926
I've been following your
incredible streak of dishonesty.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.636
[chuckles]
very impressive.

19:40.638 --> 19:42.722
So much so, I'd like
to offer you a position

19:42.724 --> 19:47.018
As a professor in our faculty
of cheating studies.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.853
What do you say?
Will you shape the minds

19:48.855 --> 19:52.190
Of tomorrow's
white-collar criminals?

19:53.651 --> 19:54.609
No.

19:54.777 --> 19:57.361
For once,
I learned something at college--

19:57.363 --> 19:58.738
A lesson.

19:58.740 --> 20:00.823
Cheating almost ruined my wife,

20:00.825 --> 20:02.200
Who is all the love and goodness
you can stuff

20:02.202 --> 20:04.702
Inside a green dress.

20:04.704 --> 20:07.079
I'll never cheat again.

20:07.081 --> 20:10.208
Except on diets.

20:13.338 --> 20:14.337
Okay,

20:14.339 --> 20:17.215
Here's how you really
skip a rock.

20:17.217 --> 20:19.800
Oh, I used to be so good
at this!

20:19.802 --> 20:21.719
Hey, where's bart?

20:21.721 --> 20:24.138
He said he had an appointment
every Thursday night

20:24.140 --> 20:26.015
From 7:00 to 9:00.

20:29.020 --> 20:31.687
Students, look to your left,
look to your right.

20:31.689 --> 20:34.607
Those are the people
you'll be cheating off of.
