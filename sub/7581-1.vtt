00:34.768 --> 00:38.170
I could fall asleep...

00:38.172 --> 00:42.241
With the warmth of you near me.

00:42.243 --> 00:46.378
The sound of your heart sings.

00:46.380 --> 00:50.783
Sings what?

00:50.785 --> 00:53.452
Together...

00:53.454 --> 00:55.387
Together.

02:45.198 --> 02:48.800
<i>[ phone ringing ]</i>

02:48.802 --> 02:52.604
Tomassini residence?

02:52.606 --> 02:53.805
She's not available
at this moment,

02:53.807 --> 02:58.544
Can I take a message?

02:58.546 --> 03:02.414
Thank you.

04:59.832 --> 05:02.834
It's really coming down.

05:06.005 --> 05:12.010
I'm Paolo.

05:12.012 --> 05:14.546
Djuna.

05:18.017 --> 05:20.686
So do you live here?

05:20.688 --> 05:23.021
No.

05:23.023 --> 05:25.490
My friend is doing
a play in the city,

05:25.492 --> 05:30.362
So I'm staying in her house.

05:39.105 --> 05:41.440
What about you?

05:41.442 --> 05:43.842
I'm here writing a script.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.911
They got me a house, to write.

05:45.913 --> 05:50.649
You know, no distractions.

06:03.096 --> 06:05.497
You're, what?

06:05.499 --> 06:08.367
Artist?

06:08.369 --> 06:10.035
No.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.970
I translate poetry
and literature into

06:11.972 --> 06:13.105
Different languages.

06:13.107 --> 06:20.112
That sounds like a
pretty serious job.

06:20.114 --> 06:22.914
It's practical.

06:22.916 --> 06:28.820
I have a...Skin
condition...Where I can't be

06:28.822 --> 06:35.494
Exposed to sunlight.

06:35.496 --> 06:37.963
I' m sorry.

06:51.644 --> 06:53.712
This place is huge.

07:29.048 --> 07:30.849
No, go!

07:30.851 --> 07:31.516
This was a mistake.

07:31.518 --> 07:32.117
I'm sorry.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.985
It's not a mistake.

07:39.125 --> 07:43.862
I want you to leave.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.864
I'm gonna leave, but I'm
gonna call you tomorrow.

07:45.866 --> 07:49.000
No, don't call.

07:49.002 --> 07:51.503
Go.

07:51.505 --> 07:52.504
Please go.

08:38.851 --> 08:42.254
<i>Through phone:</i>
<i>Hey Paolo, it's donna.</i>

08:42.256 --> 08:45.924
I've been thinking a lot, and I
don't know why I said I needed

08:45.926 --> 08:49.060
<i>I was really happy</i>
<i>with the way things were.</i>

08:49.062 --> 08:51.796
<i>It was stupid.</i>

08:51.798 --> 08:55.267
<i>And I think that's</i>
<i>great, I really do.</i>

08:57.870 --> 09:01.072
Tomassini residence.

09:01.074 --> 09:02.874
Madame is indisposed
until this evening.

09:02.876 --> 09:05.877
May I take a message?

09:05.879 --> 09:09.147
Paolo.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.015
Very well, I'll let her know.

09:20.126 --> 09:23.061
You should try some
of our other scotches.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.730
We've got some great scotch.

09:25.732 --> 09:28.333
You interested?

09:28.335 --> 09:31.803
Yeah, sure.

09:45.818 --> 09:46.351
Here you go.

09:46.353 --> 09:49.020
Thanks.

10:26.025 --> 10:26.958
What are you doing here?

10:26.960 --> 10:27.826
Will you let me in?

10:27.828 --> 10:30.895
I can't.

10:30.897 --> 10:32.163
Is this about your illness?

10:32.165 --> 10:34.899
Yes.

10:34.901 --> 10:38.069
Look, whatever it is you
have, I will deal with it.

10:38.071 --> 10:39.004
Just let me in.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.872
No.

10:44.010 --> 10:47.078
Let me in.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.214
No.

11:20.212 --> 11:21.680
Djuna?

11:21.682 --> 11:25.016
Get out!

12:06.292 --> 12:07.225
Hey ben.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.494
Hey, how's it comin'?

12:09.496 --> 12:10.762
You love your house?

12:10.764 --> 12:13.098
Alright, don't say I
don't take care of you.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.433
I don't.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.035
How's it coming, p?

12:17.037 --> 12:19.037
I just started.

12:19.039 --> 12:21.439
Of course it's gonna be great,
you're gonna knock this

12:21.441 --> 12:25.977
I know you're not into violence,
but don't be afraid of it here.

12:25.979 --> 12:27.178
It's the right thing.

12:27.180 --> 12:30.048
I won't.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.116
Feelin' good?

12:31.118 --> 12:32.851
Yeah.

12:34.987 --> 12:37.188
Paolo?

12:37.190 --> 12:39.057
Hello?

12:39.059 --> 12:41.993
Paolo, where are you?

12:41.995 --> 12:44.162
Paolo?

12:44.164 --> 12:45.029
Paolo?

12:45.031 --> 12:47.298
Hey, Paolo!

12:47.300 --> 12:49.834
Hey.

12:49.836 --> 12:53.838
Sorry.

13:19.064 --> 13:20.131
Paolo .

13:20.133 --> 13:20.999
I'm comin' over.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.467
Answer the door.

14:01.473 --> 14:03.408
Come over here.

14:14.453 --> 14:16.120
Feel my heart.

14:16.122 --> 14:21.059
Find my heartbeat.

14:21.061 --> 14:25.864
It's not there, Paolo.

14:32.605 --> 14:35.206
I can't go in sunlight.

14:35.208 --> 14:38.610
I drink the blood
of animals to live.

14:38.612 --> 14:41.012
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

14:41.014 --> 14:46.918
You're telling me
you're a vampire?

14:46.920 --> 14:49.587
Are you kidding me?

14:49.589 --> 14:51.589
What do think
happened last night?

15:00.532 --> 15:04.936
There's no such thing
as vampires, djuna.

15:04.938 --> 15:07.405
No?

15:07.407 --> 15:10.208
Alright.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.076
I'll show you.

15:24.556 --> 15:29.193
I'm not feeling
good about doing this.

15:29.195 --> 15:29.627
There's nothing to worry about.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.329
You're safe.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.932
I can't hurt you this way.

16:17.276 --> 16:19.077
Paolo!

16:19.079 --> 16:23.147
It's happening!

16:23.149 --> 16:24.015
Come here!

16:24.017 --> 16:27.352
Come here!

16:32.024 --> 16:35.493
Holy shit!

16:35.495 --> 16:39.697
Keep your hands
away from my mouth!

16:44.703 --> 16:45.703
Djuna?

16:45.705 --> 16:49.374
Oh god.

17:00.152 --> 17:02.153
Do you believe me now?

17:02.155 --> 17:05.490
Look at me.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.717
No!

17:56.375 --> 17:57.642
No.

17:57.644 --> 18:00.244
No.

18:47.326 --> 18:50.261
Let's make love.

20:12.277 --> 20:15.546
Are you scared?

20:15.548 --> 20:18.216
No.

20:18.218 --> 20:25.590
This is what had to happen.

20:25.592 --> 20:31.262
I would have done anything to
be with you...However insane.

20:31.264 --> 20:32.263
I know.

20:32.265 --> 20:35.666
It's all insane.

20:35.668 --> 20:40.871
And I know in my heart, it would
have been wrong to let you go.

20:40.873 --> 20:45.876
For both of us.

20:45.878 --> 20:49.413
My world belongs to you now.

20:49.415 --> 20:54.285
I will teach you
everything I know.

20:58.625 --> 21:01.259
Very closely knit.

21:01.261 --> 21:05.930
Xenia, the actress who owns
this house, for example...

21:05.932 --> 21:08.332
She designed it
for needs like ours.

21:08.334 --> 21:11.802
Little things,
but very important.

21:11.804 --> 21:16.474
And irene, the housekeeper...

21:16.476 --> 21:18.542
She's got a rare blood
disorder, so she's not a

21:18.544 --> 21:20.478
Temptation for us.

21:20.480 --> 21:25.616
Her mother had it too, so
she's very highly valued.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.618
Extremely loyal.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.553
She looks after the house.

21:29.555 --> 21:32.957
Keeps watch during the day.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.825
You'll start to feel a
pressure in your lower back...

21:34.827 --> 21:38.829
And that will turn
into a hunger...

21:38.831 --> 21:44.068
And that hunger will
grow until you feed it.

21:44.070 --> 21:46.937
And if you don't feed, that
hunger will turn into pain.

21:46.939 --> 21:53.811
You can't let it get to that,
or you'll be out of control.

21:54.946 --> 21:57.882
Will we live forever?

21:57.884 --> 22:00.484
Chances are, we will.

22:00.486 --> 22:03.087
But there are ways to die.

22:03.089 --> 22:03.754
Sunlight.

22:03.756 --> 22:06.957
Fire.

22:06.959 --> 22:11.095
But we won't get older,
and we won't get sick.

22:11.097 --> 22:15.499
And if we get hurt, we
heal almost right away.

22:15.501 --> 22:18.703
It's a different reality.

22:18.705 --> 22:21.038
But I know we can
have a normal life.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.440
You and me.

22:22.442 --> 22:24.909
Forever.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.020
Not here.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.688
Not yet.

22:39.491 --> 22:40.825
Come.

22:40.827 --> 22:43.894
Let's go home.

22:56.576 --> 22:59.377
So you can write those
screenplays you're

22:59.379 --> 23:02.513
So crazy about.

23:02.515 --> 23:04.582
Are you trying to
tell me something?

23:04.584 --> 23:08.953
No, I'm trying to tell you
that maybe it's time to get your

23:08.955 --> 23:10.821
Things and move in.

24:13.585 --> 24:16.454
You got it all?

24:16.456 --> 24:18.722
Yeah.

24:27.065 --> 24:29.900
I'm happy.

24:29.902 --> 24:34.839
I'm really happy, Paolo.

24:34.841 --> 24:36.507
I made you coq au vin.

24:36.509 --> 24:39.109
It smells incredible.

24:39.111 --> 24:41.512
It turned out perfectly.

24:45.050 --> 24:48.252
Can I say something?

24:48.254 --> 24:49.854
Of course.

24:49.856 --> 24:52.122
I just want to get it over with.

24:56.795 --> 24:59.930
Ok.

26:09.067 --> 26:12.002
It feels weird that
it was so natural.

26:12.004 --> 26:15.873
That it didn't bother me more.

26:15.875 --> 26:19.877
I was surprised that
I knew what to do.

26:19.879 --> 26:24.882
And feel how I've changed.

26:24.884 --> 26:25.816
Even my vision.

26:25.818 --> 26:28.886
What I see.

26:28.888 --> 26:33.190
I can't believe how
much I was missing before.

26:33.192 --> 26:39.129
Everything just feels so...

26:39.131 --> 26:49.173
Heightened.

26:49.175 --> 26:59.617
Heightened.

26:59.619 --> 27:00.951
What are you doing here?

27:00.953 --> 27:02.286
Nice to see you, too, djuna.

27:02.288 --> 27:08.092
I'm staying here for a week
while my new place gets set up.

27:08.094 --> 27:10.828
Well, call her if you want.

27:10.830 --> 27:13.030
Hi, I'm mimi.

27:13.032 --> 27:14.932
Djuna's sister.

27:14.934 --> 27:20.738
It's really not a good
idea for you to stay here.

27:20.740 --> 27:21.805
Where am I supposed
to go, djuna?

27:21.807 --> 27:27.011
To a hotel?

27:27.013 --> 27:28.345
I'm only going to
be here a week.

27:28.347 --> 27:30.147
It's not like I'm going
to hang around you anyway.

27:30.149 --> 27:35.285
Don't worry.

27:35.287 --> 27:36.754
You look great.

27:36.756 --> 27:37.354
What's your secret?

27:37.356 --> 27:38.889
Dog blood?

27:38.891 --> 27:42.426
I take it the two of
you don't get along.

27:42.428 --> 27:44.762
No she's...

27:44.764 --> 27:46.030
What?

27:46.032 --> 27:49.099
She's a disturbed creature.

27:54.706 --> 27:56.674
Where are you coming from?

27:56.676 --> 27:58.142
Amsterdam.

27:58.144 --> 27:59.076
Amsterdam?

27:59.078 --> 28:01.145
It was horrible.

28:01.147 --> 28:02.746
The group I was
living with was crazy.

28:02.748 --> 28:05.282
I couldn't take it anymore.

28:05.284 --> 28:08.218
You couldn't take it, or
they couldn't take it?

28:11.823 --> 28:12.289
How long were you there?

28:12.291 --> 28:14.758
Five years.

28:14.760 --> 28:16.827
It was fun at first.

28:16.829 --> 28:20.030
It's a great city, but my
roommates ruined it for me.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.833
People were catching on to us.

28:22.835 --> 28:25.703
I started to be
afraid to go to bed.

28:25.705 --> 28:27.705
I thought I was going to
be torched by a church

28:27.707 --> 28:29.707
Group or something.

28:29.709 --> 28:31.241
So?

28:31.243 --> 28:34.111
What's in phoenix?

28:34.113 --> 28:35.245
Where will you live there?

28:35.247 --> 28:36.847
On a ranch.

28:36.849 --> 28:38.949
It's like a commune.

28:38.951 --> 28:40.417
You make night
blooming gardens, pottery.

28:40.419 --> 28:42.219
You study latin literature.

28:42.221 --> 28:46.023
Basically, it's rehab.

28:46.025 --> 28:47.024
Xenia thinks that's
what I need to do,

28:47.026 --> 28:49.827
So I'm gonna try it.

28:49.829 --> 28:56.767
I guess I don't really
have a choice, do I?

28:56.769 --> 29:01.238
Cheers.

29:09.981 --> 29:11.181
That wasn't so bad.

29:11.183 --> 29:13.917
She's a crazy freak, you'll see.

29:13.919 --> 29:15.252
She didn't sound crazy.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.988
She seemed pretty cohesive.

29:17.990 --> 29:20.424
Crazy's not the word.

29:20.426 --> 29:23.160
She's not out of
touch with reality.

29:23.162 --> 29:24.428
She's sick.

29:24.430 --> 29:25.963
It's only a week.

29:25.965 --> 29:28.031
The clock is already ticking.

29:28.033 --> 29:29.099
She'll be gone soon.

29:58.530 --> 29:59.997
I had a nightmare.

29:59.999 --> 30:02.366
We were at the ballet school.

30:02.368 --> 30:06.970
We were hiding in the closet
and she was trying to find us.

30:06.972 --> 30:10.107
I wonder if she's
still teaching.

30:10.109 --> 30:13.310
Maybe someone got her.

30:13.312 --> 30:17.447
Damn vampire solidarity.

30:17.449 --> 30:20.184
I'm sure they moved her...

30:20.186 --> 30:21.585
Somewhere.

30:21.587 --> 30:25.522
I had a dream, too, about mom.

30:25.524 --> 30:26.924
I can't remember
her face anymore.

30:26.926 --> 30:29.193
Can you?

30:29.195 --> 30:31.528
Not really.

30:31.530 --> 30:34.264
It's gone.

30:34.266 --> 30:35.465
Nothing's left.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.467
Wow!

30:37.469 --> 30:38.468
Look at them.

30:38.470 --> 30:41.271
That looks so fun, doesn't it?

30:46.244 --> 30:49.046
It's interesting to
see you with a man.

30:49.048 --> 30:51.849
It's been a long time since...

30:51.851 --> 30:53.050
What was his name?

30:53.052 --> 30:55.586
Henry?

30:55.588 --> 30:56.453
What was that?

30:56.455 --> 31:00.390
Sixty, seventy years ago?

31:03.127 --> 31:05.128
A long time ago.

31:05.130 --> 31:06.063
I forget.

31:06.065 --> 31:08.332
Did you turn him or not?

31:08.334 --> 31:09.333
You know I didn't.

31:09.335 --> 31:10.934
Yeah, that's right.

31:10.936 --> 31:15.606
You wouldn't do that to someone.

31:15.608 --> 31:18.942
Well, what made
you turn this one?

31:18.944 --> 31:22.012
The loneliness got to you?

31:22.014 --> 31:23.146
I've been alone a long time.

31:23.148 --> 31:26.049
It wasn't that.

31:26.051 --> 31:28.385
It was just going
to happen with him.

31:28.387 --> 31:29.253
What does that mean?

31:29.255 --> 31:32.456
It means I love him.

31:33.524 --> 31:38.061
Love him?

31:38.063 --> 31:39.129
I just want to say,
for the last century,

31:39.131 --> 31:43.000
You've judged me so harshly.

31:43.002 --> 31:45.469
And it's just strange that
now you turn someone you

31:45.471 --> 31:47.471
Claim to love.

31:47.473 --> 31:49.072
At least I've never done that.

31:49.074 --> 31:51.275
I've never bit
someone I love, djuna!

31:51.277 --> 31:54.211
I wouldn't do that.

31:54.213 --> 31:56.680
You're not capable of loving.

31:56.682 --> 31:58.415
You wouldn't know.

31:58.417 --> 32:01.685
I just know it's not an option.

32:01.687 --> 32:05.088
I'm not the sick one.

32:05.090 --> 32:08.992
Don't romanticize stupid humans,
and watch them through goggles

32:08.994 --> 32:12.596
No, you just leave a trail of
shit wherever you go and get

32:12.598 --> 32:14.131
Off on it!

32:14.133 --> 32:19.937
Speaking of getting off,
maybe you finally have...

32:19.939 --> 32:23.140
Because suddenly, you
don't mind sentencing

32:23.142 --> 32:27.277
To the shit we
have to deal with.

32:27.279 --> 32:29.680
You know what you did was wrong.

32:29.682 --> 32:33.083
Admit it!

32:33.085 --> 32:35.686
Don't fucking judge me anymore!

32:43.494 --> 32:46.096
Hi, xenia, it's djuna.

32:46.098 --> 32:48.332
How is everything at the house?

32:48.334 --> 32:50.600
Well, it's not good.

32:50.602 --> 32:52.602
It's about mimi.

32:52.604 --> 32:53.603
You know she's here?

32:53.605 --> 32:55.205
Yes, she needed a place to stay.

32:55.207 --> 32:58.275
I've arranged a safe
house for her in phoenix,

32:58.277 --> 33:00.344
But it won't be
ready for a week.

33:00.346 --> 33:03.013
Well, I'm worried.

33:03.015 --> 33:05.282
She's not stable,
you know she's not.

33:05.284 --> 33:07.684
Darling, she wants
to change her life,

33:07.686 --> 33:10.354
And I can't turn
my back on that.

33:10.356 --> 33:12.422
She's a monster.

33:12.424 --> 33:14.024
You're sisters.

33:14.026 --> 33:18.295
And the fact that she's
crowding in on this love

33:18.297 --> 33:19.229
Affair you're having...

33:22.700 --> 33:25.769
I was going to
tell you about him.

33:25.771 --> 33:27.704
Paolo.

33:27.706 --> 33:30.007
Darling, I trust
your judgment...

33:30.009 --> 33:33.744
But if you can just
bear with mimi for a week.

33:33.746 --> 33:35.746
Of course.

34:23.161 --> 34:24.293
Thank you.

34:24.295 --> 34:26.429
Thank you.

34:26.431 --> 34:30.233
So, I want to
tell you something.

34:30.235 --> 34:32.835
I have some money and...

34:32.838 --> 34:36.373
I'd like to get us a house.

34:36.375 --> 34:41.378
I was thinking we'd go
somewhere out of the country.

34:41.380 --> 34:45.449
Someplace new, where
we could start again.

34:45.451 --> 34:46.583
Yeah?

34:46.585 --> 34:49.453
Yeah.

34:58.696 --> 35:01.231
Just give me a minute.

35:01.233 --> 35:04.367
I'll take care of everything.

35:07.238 --> 35:12.109
I've never lived
with anyone before.

35:12.111 --> 35:14.311
Good.

36:11.802 --> 36:16.573
♪  <i>I think I'm afraid.</i> ♪

36:16.575 --> 36:19.376
♪  <i>I feel so exposed.</i> ♪

36:19.378 --> 36:22.779
♪  <i>I can hear myself.</i> ♪

36:49.941 --> 36:51.875
Hey!

36:51.877 --> 36:54.678
Hey, wait.

36:55.947 --> 37:00.250
I was gonna offer
to buy you a drink.

37:00.252 --> 37:02.852
Thirsty?

37:02.854 --> 37:05.322
Come here.

37:05.324 --> 37:08.458
Sure you don't want
to come back inside?

37:08.460 --> 37:12.996
I'd rather be here.

37:13.931 --> 37:16.800
Ok, well...

37:16.802 --> 37:19.469
Let me know if you change
your mind about that drink.

37:19.471 --> 37:21.605
Come here and kiss me.

37:42.260 --> 37:42.993
Adam!

37:42.995 --> 37:45.262
Yo!

38:01.946 --> 38:05.882
Come on.

38:13.758 --> 38:17.360
Taking forever...

40:52.983 --> 40:55.785
You know you don't have
to do that, don't you?

40:55.787 --> 40:58.721
Djuna is completely neurotic.

40:58.723 --> 40:59.856
The possum was dead.

40:59.858 --> 41:05.795
Everyone knows
that about animals.

41:05.797 --> 41:08.832
If it makes her feel
better, it's fine by me.

41:23.781 --> 41:26.716
So, tell me Paolo.

41:26.718 --> 41:29.185
There are really guys
like you out there...

41:29.187 --> 41:31.921
Who want to have the
life sucked out of them?

41:31.923 --> 41:35.191
Go fuck yourself!

41:35.193 --> 41:39.128
Do you think those
guys have problems?

41:39.130 --> 41:42.599
Maybe aren't mentally healthy?

41:42.601 --> 41:43.933
I would say, wouldn't you?

41:43.935 --> 41:46.870
Why the fuck are
you so interested?

41:46.872 --> 41:48.705
I don't know.

41:48.707 --> 41:51.040
Maybe I'd like a
guy like that for me.

41:51.042 --> 41:53.643
Good-looking.

41:53.645 --> 41:56.913
Destructive.

41:56.915 --> 41:57.914
Oh yeah.

41:57.916 --> 42:00.250
But you're not destructive.

42:00.252 --> 42:04.988
This is all about love.

42:06.590 --> 42:09.259
Tough guy, huh?

42:50.869 --> 42:53.069
Djuna?

42:53.071 --> 42:55.939
Come over.

42:55.941 --> 42:58.007
Beautiful.

42:58.009 --> 42:59.943
Ciao.

43:01.745 --> 43:03.212
It's going to be fun.

43:03.214 --> 43:05.014
Everyone there will be like us.

43:05.016 --> 43:07.016
It'll be good for
you to meet them.

43:07.018 --> 43:09.152
It's important.

43:10.921 --> 43:14.057
Djuna!

43:14.059 --> 43:22.665
Paolo.

43:22.667 --> 43:23.933
It is so nice to meet you.

43:24.602 --> 43:27.070
Djuna's told me
wonderful things about you.

43:27.072 --> 43:28.671
I've heard so many wonderful
things about you as well.

43:28.673 --> 43:31.140
You have a beautiful
apartment, and a beautiful

43:31.142 --> 43:33.076
Home, of course.

43:33.078 --> 43:35.144
Thank you for
letting me stay there.

43:35.146 --> 43:38.081
It is my absolute
pleasure, Paolo.

43:38.083 --> 43:41.618
I've seen some of your films.

43:41.620 --> 43:43.620
No, you are!

43:43.622 --> 43:45.355
You're a very talented writer.

43:45.357 --> 43:47.357
One day you have to
write a part for me.

43:47.359 --> 43:48.224
Anytime.

43:48.226 --> 43:51.828
It would be my honor.

43:51.830 --> 43:55.198
Omar, come meet my
very dear friends.

43:55.200 --> 43:58.334
Djuna and Paolo.

43:58.336 --> 43:58.935
How nice to meet you.

43:58.937 --> 44:00.203
Hello.

44:00.205 --> 44:02.005
Lydia and omar came
from rome for my opening.

44:02.007 --> 44:03.873
You should see their place.

44:03.875 --> 44:06.676
They may have the most
exquisite taste I've ever seen.

44:06.678 --> 44:07.944
We were just talking
about going to rome.

44:07.946 --> 44:09.812
Maybe even moving there.

44:09.814 --> 44:11.280
Oh, you should.

44:11.282 --> 44:13.282
It's one of the
best cities for us.

44:13.284 --> 44:15.885
Large community.

44:15.887 --> 44:18.221
Perfect for lovers.

44:19.957 --> 44:21.891
Are you new?

44:21.893 --> 44:25.028
No, not at all.

44:25.030 --> 44:27.964
Both of you are beautiful.

44:27.966 --> 44:30.967
The first 100 years
are insufferable,

44:30.969 --> 44:32.035
But they do get easier.

44:32.037 --> 44:32.902
The previews start Saturday...

44:32.904 --> 44:36.673
Night, of course.

44:36.675 --> 44:38.274
Obviously, I don't do matinees.

44:38.276 --> 44:39.409
And why should you?

44:39.411 --> 44:40.677
Good to meet you!

44:40.679 --> 44:41.811
Nice to meet you as well.

44:41.813 --> 44:44.814
So, they tell me
that you're new.

44:44.816 --> 44:47.884
Yes, I'm sure there's
still quite a bit to learn.

44:47.886 --> 44:50.019
Ah, there is, there is indeed.

44:50.021 --> 44:52.155
You're in excellent hands.

44:52.157 --> 44:54.424
Djuna's a treasure.

44:54.426 --> 44:56.159
So you're staying up at
Xenia's place in connecticut?

44:56.161 --> 44:57.293
We are.

44:57.295 --> 44:59.829
I love that place.

44:59.831 --> 45:01.964
A little amuse-bouche, everyone?

45:09.440 --> 45:10.440
Oh, don't worry, it's not human.

45:10.442 --> 45:14.844
I don't know, but whatever
it is, it's kosher.

45:14.846 --> 45:15.945
Xenia doesn't mess around.

45:15.947 --> 45:18.414
Whatever this is, it
is the beluga of

45:18.416 --> 45:23.152
Politically-correct plasma.

45:23.154 --> 45:24.754
Bottoms up!

45:28.759 --> 45:29.826
Yeah.

45:29.828 --> 45:33.296
He's extraordinary.

45:33.298 --> 45:37.100
He would make a great actor
because he's so full of pain.

45:37.102 --> 45:37.834
Pain?

45:37.836 --> 45:40.169
Not the bad kind.

45:40.171 --> 45:41.104
No, not pain.

45:41.106 --> 45:44.974
Let' say, awareness.

45:44.976 --> 45:49.112
Soul.

45:49.114 --> 45:49.979
He's extraordinary.

46:02.760 --> 46:05.094
My darling!

46:05.096 --> 46:09.098
So happy to see you!

46:15.038 --> 46:17.373
Cheers.

46:24.181 --> 46:28.451
I have a few cases of this
synthetic blood for each of you.

46:28.453 --> 46:30.987
Try not to go
through it too quickly.

46:30.989 --> 46:33.256
I don't know how long this
army connection will last.

46:33.258 --> 46:35.925
Or how long we'll have access.

46:35.927 --> 46:39.295
The fda hasn't approved it.

46:39.297 --> 46:41.898
Even if the fda approves...

46:41.900 --> 46:45.034
It's not that we'll be able to
get it any more consistently.

46:45.036 --> 46:47.904
It's not like we can
exactly lobby for why...

46:47.906 --> 46:51.908
Prescriptions for us would be a
good idea for the mainstream.

46:51.910 --> 46:54.043
Of course not.

46:54.045 --> 46:58.514
And if they knew we did,
I highly highly doubt...

46:58.516 --> 47:01.384
That they'd deal with it by
selling us synthetic blood.

47:01.386 --> 47:03.319
It makes me so mad!

47:03.321 --> 47:05.922
The way we're forced to live.

47:05.924 --> 47:09.525
I mean this isn't their
world, it's our world!

47:09.527 --> 47:11.928
They're just passing through.

47:11.930 --> 47:14.130
It's not our world.

47:14.132 --> 47:15.865
We may never die,
but collectively,

47:15.867 --> 47:18.534
Well, we're the
ones forced to hide.

47:18.536 --> 47:21.838
We are the monsters.

47:21.840 --> 47:26.175
I can't abide any more
of this self-loathing.

47:26.177 --> 47:28.044
We know what the situation is.

47:28.046 --> 47:30.513
We discuss it all the time.

47:30.515 --> 47:32.582
We're at the beginning of
creating a civilization

47:32.584 --> 47:34.984
For ourselves.

47:34.986 --> 47:38.054
Just like they did when
they realized that...

47:38.056 --> 47:40.923
Killing and raping on a regular
basis was not a fulfilling

47:40.925 --> 47:43.059
Way to live.

47:44.595 --> 47:47.597
I don't want to hear
the term "monsters."

47:47.599 --> 47:50.199
We're all monsters.

47:50.201 --> 47:53.269
Potentially, you
know, potentially not.

47:53.271 --> 47:58.140
Yes, but one has
to ask oneself...

47:58.142 --> 48:02.445
Does the existence of dr.
Jekyll make mr. Hyde any less

48:02.447 --> 48:05.047
Of a monster?

48:05.049 --> 48:08.384
I think that the point we
all have come to realize,

48:08.386 --> 48:15.524
Hans...Is that what civilization
is is a set of moral laws....

48:15.526 --> 48:20.930
And if those laws are broken,
there will be punishment.

48:20.932 --> 48:21.664
Humans still break them...

48:21.666 --> 48:24.467
But for the most part...

48:24.469 --> 48:31.340
These laws have forced
them to value humanity...

48:31.342 --> 48:34.210
To develop sensitivity...

48:34.212 --> 48:39.081
Which is just as real in
them as their baser impulses.

48:39.083 --> 48:42.084
I mean, those laws...

48:42.086 --> 48:46.923
Have freed them to
experience their little lives...

48:46.925 --> 48:51.594
The way we haven't been able to.

48:51.596 --> 48:53.996
I don't like them.

48:53.998 --> 48:59.068
I don't find them touching,
the way you seem to.

48:59.070 --> 49:02.138
I don't find you touching.

49:02.140 --> 49:05.074
They are the best
audiences, I can tell you that.

49:05.076 --> 49:11.414
Vampires are notorious
for "golf applause".

49:11.416 --> 49:14.083
Xenia, jesus.

49:14.085 --> 49:16.085
The ultimate barometer
for superior race,

49:16.087 --> 49:19.155
According to xenia...

49:19.157 --> 49:21.290
How adoring is the audience?

49:21.292 --> 49:23.559
Yes.

49:23.561 --> 49:27.163
Where did mimi go?

50:36.299 --> 50:39.168
She's home.

50:47.244 --> 50:50.413
What the fuck is she doing?

50:50.415 --> 50:54.617
What is she listening to?

50:54.619 --> 50:57.486
I kind of like it.

51:04.294 --> 51:06.228
Excuse me.

51:06.230 --> 51:07.096
I'm sorry to interrupt.

51:07.098 --> 51:09.632
You must leave!

51:09.634 --> 51:11.500
Who the hell do
you think you are?

51:11.502 --> 51:12.368
Who is she?

51:12.370 --> 51:15.571
I'm Mimi's sister.

51:15.573 --> 51:17.373
You should know that mimi has
a serious medical condition..

51:17.375 --> 51:20.709
And should not be engaging in
any irresponsible encounters.

51:20.711 --> 51:24.647
I do not have a
medical condition.

51:24.649 --> 51:26.182
She most certainly does.

51:26.184 --> 51:29.118
Please wait outside.

51:29.120 --> 51:30.686
I'll call you a taxi, and
leave you money to get home.

51:30.688 --> 51:32.488
Please go!

51:32.490 --> 51:33.289
Oh my god!

51:33.291 --> 51:37.426
It's alright.

51:37.428 --> 51:39.562
Oh my god!

51:39.564 --> 51:40.763
Oh my god!

51:40.765 --> 51:45.101
What did we almost
get ourselves into?

51:45.103 --> 51:45.768
Do you think we're gonna be ok?

51:45.770 --> 51:46.769
Yeah, we're ok.

51:46.771 --> 51:48.838
I want to get out of here, ok?

51:48.840 --> 51:52.308
What's going on?

51:54.845 --> 51:58.647
Your girlfriend thinks
she's the lady of the house.

51:58.649 --> 52:02.184
She thinks she can just come
in here and kick my guests out.

52:02.186 --> 52:05.321
She thinks she can
have friends here,

52:05.323 --> 52:06.789
But I can't.

52:06.791 --> 52:09.258
Friends?

52:09.260 --> 52:11.427
Really?

52:11.429 --> 52:14.230
It's not going to go
anywhere like this.

52:15.298 --> 52:19.702
Did it turn you on?

52:19.704 --> 52:20.769
What?

52:23.507 --> 52:25.508
What?

52:44.261 --> 52:44.927
How long has it been?

52:44.929 --> 52:46.929
I don't know.

52:46.931 --> 52:48.464
Not that long.

52:48.466 --> 52:51.867
This is such a
fucking nightmare.

52:51.869 --> 52:54.236
I can't wait to be
back in our apartment.

52:54.238 --> 52:56.438
We're not kids anymore,
this was so stupid of us.

52:56.440 --> 52:59.375
The only thing that we did
that was stupid was get

52:59.377 --> 53:00.476
In someone's car...

53:00.478 --> 53:02.178
And drive 1
outside the city.

53:02.180 --> 53:06.182
Other than that, we
didn't do anything wrong.

53:06.184 --> 53:08.317
I don't know.

53:08.319 --> 53:10.186
I can't help but think we
brought this on ourselves,

53:10.188 --> 53:12.521
You know?

53:12.523 --> 53:13.722
Please!

53:13.724 --> 53:16.592
Who are you right now?

53:16.594 --> 53:19.195
I love you, jack.

53:19.197 --> 53:21.864
I never said that you didn't.

53:21.866 --> 53:25.801
I love you too, now just
stop acting like a child.

53:25.803 --> 53:26.869
What's that?

53:26.871 --> 53:30.206
Did you hear that noise?

53:31.408 --> 53:32.341
Just an animal.

53:32.343 --> 53:33.742
Just stay here.

53:33.744 --> 53:34.510
No jack, don't go over there!

53:34.512 --> 53:36.979
Jack, don't.

53:36.981 --> 53:38.581
Don't go over there!

53:38.583 --> 53:41.517
Please!

53:41.519 --> 53:47.990
Jack, don't!

53:47.992 --> 53:50.392
Shit!

53:50.394 --> 53:52.261
Jack!

55:20.016 --> 55:20.816
You call for a cab?

55:29.759 --> 55:30.759
Where are they?

55:30.761 --> 55:33.896
Probably at the
clinic, getting tests.

55:33.898 --> 55:35.898
I told you, you don't listen!

55:35.900 --> 55:38.667
You keep coming
back into my life,

55:38.669 --> 55:39.935
Over and over again.

55:39.937 --> 55:41.003
Destroying everything!

55:41.005 --> 55:42.738
Why can't I be free of you?

55:42.740 --> 55:45.808
Why?

56:08.832 --> 56:10.833
Xenia would ex-communicate
you, if she knew.

56:10.835 --> 56:13.035
Stay away from me!

56:13.037 --> 56:16.972
Don't interfere with my life!

56:16.974 --> 56:19.842
You'll be away soon enough!

56:39.829 --> 56:41.163
Let me over, prick!

56:41.165 --> 56:44.099
Hey, Paolo, what's going on?

56:44.101 --> 56:46.702
What are you doing man?

56:46.704 --> 56:49.638
You haven't returned any
of my texts or anything.

56:49.640 --> 56:52.574
I'm on my way up to
the house, 'cause...

56:52.576 --> 56:53.175
I'm a little concerned, man.

56:53.177 --> 56:55.177
It's not like you.

56:55.179 --> 56:56.845
It's like you
dropped off the planet.

56:56.847 --> 57:00.849
Anyway, I'll be there
in like 20 minutes.

57:00.851 --> 57:01.817
That's it.

57:01.819 --> 57:02.751
I'll see you soon.

57:02.753 --> 57:03.886
Alright, buddy?

57:03.888 --> 57:04.953
Alright, I'll talk to you later.

57:08.558 --> 57:14.897
Well then don't fucking
put your fucking blinker on!

57:14.899 --> 57:17.633
Good, what can I get for you?

57:17.635 --> 57:21.637
Can I get a vodka-soda, please.

57:21.639 --> 57:23.572
Hey...

57:23.574 --> 57:25.641
Have you seen a new
guy hanging around here?

57:25.643 --> 57:27.576
Dark-haired, good-looking guy?

57:27.578 --> 57:28.644
Drinks scotch?

57:28.646 --> 57:30.846
Yeah, I've seen
him in here, why?

57:30.848 --> 57:32.781
I'm his agent.

57:32.783 --> 57:33.515
I'm ben rider.

57:33.517 --> 57:35.851
I've been trying to
get ahold of him...

57:35.853 --> 57:39.988
I went by the house I
put him up in and...

57:39.990 --> 57:41.657
Nothing, looks like no
one's living there.

57:41.659 --> 57:44.026
Yeah well, I heard he's been
staying out with a girl

57:44.028 --> 57:47.095
On hansen road.

57:47.097 --> 57:50.165
I wouldn't be too
worried about him though.

57:50.167 --> 57:53.502
He's having quite the affair.

57:53.504 --> 57:54.102
Is that right?

57:54.104 --> 57:55.237
Yeah.

57:55.239 --> 57:56.772
So what's your deal?

57:56.774 --> 58:00.042
You an actress?

58:06.049 --> 58:10.719
You like the way it
feels to hunt, no?

58:10.721 --> 58:11.920
I like a lot of things.

58:11.922 --> 58:13.989
I don't need that.

58:13.991 --> 58:15.991
Me neither.

58:20.129 --> 58:22.931
Son of a bitch!

58:27.971 --> 58:30.973
Paolo!

58:30.975 --> 58:31.974
Paolo?

58:31.976 --> 58:34.643
Oh, it's my fucking agent.

58:37.981 --> 58:38.914
Ben.

58:38.916 --> 58:39.648
Hey.

58:39.650 --> 58:42.050
Jesus, it's hard to
find you up here.

58:42.052 --> 58:43.652
How are you?

58:43.654 --> 58:44.119
I'm good.

58:44.121 --> 58:45.854
Good to see you.

58:45.856 --> 58:47.656
It's good to see you too.

58:47.658 --> 58:49.591
Djuna, this is my
agent, ben rider.

58:49.593 --> 58:50.125
Hi.

58:50.127 --> 58:53.595
So you're the one who
stole my client away from me?

58:53.597 --> 58:54.730
Look at you, you're gorgeous.

58:54.732 --> 58:55.664
Are you an actress?

58:55.666 --> 58:57.666
Well you should be.

58:57.668 --> 59:00.135
Come on in.

59:01.671 --> 59:04.139
Oh, my goodness,
this is fucking crazy!

59:04.141 --> 59:06.308
You haven't been
writing shit, have you?

59:06.310 --> 59:07.643
I have.

59:07.645 --> 59:09.111
Oh, you're full of shit.

59:09.113 --> 59:10.712
I have.

59:10.714 --> 59:11.847
I just printed out some stuff.

59:11.849 --> 59:14.249
I'll show you.

59:14.251 --> 59:16.251
Dude, if you could parlay what
you're doing here out there,

59:16.253 --> 59:18.253
You're going to be huge.

59:18.255 --> 59:21.123
Read it and then
we'll have dinner.

59:21.125 --> 59:22.190
This is all new stuff?

59:27.997 --> 59:29.598
Djuna, this is incredible.

59:29.600 --> 59:32.668
I took a chance on coming
out here and I got

59:32.670 --> 59:34.670
The royal treatment.

59:34.672 --> 59:37.339
And this house is ridiculous.

59:37.341 --> 59:40.609
I mean this is
crazy time up here.

59:40.611 --> 59:42.144
You gotta remember to send
me that information on

59:42.146 --> 59:43.345
Your friend's play.

59:43.347 --> 59:46.748
I wanna see that, so you
gotta e-mail me the information.

59:46.750 --> 59:48.850
I know it's not broadway, but
I really want to check it out.

59:48.852 --> 59:49.785
I will.

59:49.787 --> 59:51.920
I'm really happy to be here.

59:51.922 --> 59:55.190
Hey pal, I gotta tell you, I
can't stop thinking about those

59:55.192 --> 59:56.592
Pages I read.

59:56.594 --> 59:57.593
They're great, man.

59:57.595 --> 59:58.327
Do you feel good about that?

59:58.329 --> 59:59.061
Yeah.

59:59.063 --> 01:00:00.996
Do you?

01:00:00.998 --> 01:00:04.066
Oh come on, man, the action
sequences are unbelievable.

01:00:04.068 --> 01:00:06.068
It's the best stuff
you've ever written.

01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:07.936
The studio's going to go crazy.

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:13.141
Do you know this guy used to
be impossible to deal with?

01:00:13.143 --> 01:00:15.010
He would write all this
artsy-fartsy crap that I

01:00:15.012 --> 01:00:16.278
Couldn't get any investors for?

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:20.082
Used to think he was
better than everyone else.

01:00:20.084 --> 01:00:22.884
I didn't think I was
better than everyone else.

01:00:22.886 --> 01:00:26.622
I just didn't understand why
people didn't expect more

01:00:26.624 --> 01:00:27.956
Out of life.

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:30.859
Yeah, well we thought
the same about you.

01:00:30.861 --> 01:00:33.996
He used to drive this artsy
car, that didn't even drive.

01:00:33.998 --> 01:00:35.330
It wasn't arty,
it was a peugeot.

01:00:35.332 --> 01:00:37.332
Fucking peugeot!

01:00:37.334 --> 01:00:39.267
A peugeot!

01:00:39.269 --> 01:00:41.069
He used to think he
was jean-luc truffaut,

01:00:41.071 --> 01:00:42.404
With this silly hat...

01:00:42.406 --> 01:00:44.873
Smoking cigarettes
and dirty fingernails.

01:00:44.875 --> 01:00:47.275
Look p...

01:00:47.277 --> 01:00:50.946
You've joined the human race,
and we're glad to have you.

01:00:50.948 --> 01:00:52.814
It's a good thing.

01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:55.150
You look good.

01:00:55.152 --> 01:00:56.084
It's nice to meet you.

01:00:56.086 --> 01:01:00.088
I didn't realize
you had teeth before.

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:01.023
Hey...

01:01:01.025 --> 01:01:02.758
To embracing life.

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:04.159
Cheers.

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:05.894
And all its flaws.

01:01:05.896 --> 01:01:08.697
And all its warts, alright?

01:01:12.135 --> 01:01:13.869
I'm gonna go use the bathroom.

01:01:13.871 --> 01:01:14.803
Woah!

01:01:14.805 --> 01:01:16.938
Are you alright?

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:21.810
Yeah, I had a drinks
meeting before I...

01:01:21.812 --> 01:01:23.412
You want some coffee?

01:01:23.414 --> 01:01:27.749
Excuse me.

01:01:27.751 --> 01:01:30.886
Do you think I could
just crash here tonight...

01:01:30.888 --> 01:01:32.821
Instead of
driving into the city?

01:01:32.823 --> 01:01:33.955
'cause I...

01:01:33.957 --> 01:01:37.693
We...

01:01:37.695 --> 01:01:40.095
We work all night, ben,
and we sleep pretty late.

01:01:40.097 --> 01:01:42.030
No, I'll be up
early in the morning.

01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:45.100
I have a breakfast meeting.

01:01:45.102 --> 01:01:46.101
No, of course.

01:01:46.103 --> 01:01:47.102
Of course you can stay.

01:01:47.104 --> 01:01:53.141
You shouldn't drive like this.

01:01:53.143 --> 01:01:56.878
Sometimes you get
speedy, you know?

01:02:30.513 --> 01:02:32.180
Paolo?

01:02:52.969 --> 01:02:57.372
Get the fuck away from me!

01:04:08.177 --> 01:04:10.312
Xenia, do you have a minute?

01:04:10.314 --> 01:04:12.981
I have to tell you, bad
things are happening.

01:04:12.983 --> 01:04:13.915
It's about mimi.

01:04:13.917 --> 01:04:16.918
She's completely out of control.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:17.519
She's endangering all of us.

01:04:17.521 --> 01:04:21.189
She's been out every
night hunting humans,

01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:22.991
Leaving them to resurrect.

01:04:22.993 --> 01:04:23.925
How do you know this?

01:04:23.927 --> 01:04:25.193
I just know.

01:04:25.195 --> 01:04:26.328
You just know?

01:04:26.330 --> 01:04:28.330
She swears to me
she's not, djuna.

01:04:28.332 --> 01:04:31.533
Unless you have proof, I have
no reason not to believe her.

01:04:31.535 --> 01:04:33.869
Now xenia, she's
bringing it into the house.

01:04:33.871 --> 01:04:36.605
The other night she
brought a couple over here.

01:04:36.607 --> 01:04:38.540
If I hadn't come...

01:04:38.542 --> 01:04:40.242
What was happening?

01:04:40.244 --> 01:04:42.644
The three of them were
in a sexual situation.

01:04:42.646 --> 01:04:44.312
They were starting -

01:04:44.314 --> 01:04:48.383
Djuna, don't be so puritanical.

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:52.454
When I first gave
up my old life,

01:04:52.456 --> 01:04:55.056
No one believed I was clean.

01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:58.526
Whatever I did was proof to
others that I was still sick.

01:04:58.528 --> 01:05:00.528
I know it's hard to
have faith in her...

01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:03.331
But I know where
she's coming from.

01:05:03.333 --> 01:05:06.067
I've been there.

01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:09.671
Darling, my play is
opening tomorrow night.

01:05:09.673 --> 01:05:12.140
Please, put your
differences aside.

01:05:12.142 --> 01:05:13.942
In a few days, she'll be gone.

01:05:46.208 --> 01:05:49.077
Djuna.

01:05:49.079 --> 01:05:50.345
What do you think?

01:05:50.347 --> 01:05:51.146
I loved it tonight.

01:05:51.148 --> 01:05:53.214
It was beyond words.

01:05:53.216 --> 01:05:54.950
Neither of us can hardly speak.

01:05:54.952 --> 01:05:56.084
You were magnificent.

01:05:56.086 --> 01:05:57.686
Your performance,
djuna is right,

01:05:57.688 --> 01:05:59.220
Was beyond words.

01:05:59.222 --> 01:06:00.088
Give me more.

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:01.423
I must have words.

01:06:01.425 --> 01:06:03.124
I mean, many words,
after you digest

01:06:03.126 --> 01:06:07.529
Ms. Tomassini, prof. Ching
would like a word with you.

01:06:07.531 --> 01:06:09.130
You're coming to dinner?

01:06:09.132 --> 01:06:11.066
Yeah, of course.

01:06:11.068 --> 01:06:11.666
Please do.

01:06:11.668 --> 01:06:14.002
I love you.

01:06:14.004 --> 01:06:16.004
Hello.

01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:32.287
How are you?

01:06:39.695 --> 01:06:42.163
Wasn't that amazing?

01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:55.010
I need to get some air.

01:06:56.145 --> 01:06:57.212
Excuse me.

01:06:59.215 --> 01:07:01.282
Always so naughty.

01:07:01.284 --> 01:07:03.018
Sorry to make you leave.

01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:04.219
Don't worry.

01:07:04.221 --> 01:07:05.754
Check out this loon.

01:07:05.756 --> 01:07:08.490
My god!

01:07:22.304 --> 01:07:23.304
Xenia!

01:07:23.306 --> 01:07:26.741
Xenia!

01:07:26.743 --> 01:07:29.277
Folks, I told you
twenty times, no autographs.

01:07:29.279 --> 01:07:32.080
I need everyone to the side!

01:07:34.617 --> 01:07:37.819
You're a fan of ms. Tomassini?

01:07:37.821 --> 01:07:39.554
What?

01:07:39.556 --> 01:07:42.824
You should meet her some time.

01:07:42.826 --> 01:07:44.826
I'm sure she'd like to meet
a fan as devoted as you

01:07:44.828 --> 01:07:46.828
Seem to be.

01:07:46.830 --> 01:07:47.829
Meet her?

01:07:47.831 --> 01:07:50.698
Give me your number.

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:51.699
Mimi!

01:07:51.701 --> 01:07:53.101
Andiamo, for Christ's sake!

01:07:53.103 --> 01:07:54.836
How old are you?

01:07:54.838 --> 01:07:57.839
Seventeen.

01:07:57.841 --> 01:07:59.107
Hmm.

01:07:59.109 --> 01:08:02.177
Lovely age.

01:08:16.292 --> 01:08:18.292
What are you doing?

01:08:18.295 --> 01:08:20.361
She's not leaving.

01:08:20.363 --> 01:08:22.630
So then we'll leave sooner.

01:08:22.631 --> 01:08:27.368
Either way, you've got to
stop doing this to yourself.

01:08:29.638 --> 01:08:32.107
Why don't we get out of
the house for a while?

01:08:32.109 --> 01:08:36.444
Huh?

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:39.581
Go down the hill, take a drive.

01:08:39.582 --> 01:08:41.381
Clear your head.

01:12:15.831 --> 01:12:16.864
If a part of you didn't want
me, I could have never

01:12:16.866 --> 01:12:21.869
Made this work.

01:13:09.952 --> 01:13:12.487
Pack.

01:13:12.489 --> 01:13:15.690
We're leaving
tomorrow night, early.

01:13:15.692 --> 01:13:17.091
We're gonna go to Italy.

01:13:17.093 --> 01:13:17.825
Stay with the couple from
Cenia's party till our

01:13:17.827 --> 01:13:20.161
House is ready.

01:13:20.163 --> 01:13:22.764
Xenia arranged for
a private plane.

01:13:22.766 --> 01:13:24.432
Everything.

01:13:24.434 --> 01:13:26.434
It's all happening.

01:13:26.436 --> 01:13:27.969
Pack.

01:13:28.971 --> 01:13:29.837
She's expecting us, right?

01:13:29.839 --> 01:13:32.640
She's expecting me.

01:13:32.642 --> 01:13:36.844
I told her I was in the
neighborhood and I'd drop by.

01:13:36.846 --> 01:13:38.913
She doesn't know
you've brought me?

01:13:38.915 --> 01:13:41.849
Do you think she'll be upset?

01:13:45.087 --> 01:13:47.688
She'll be delighted.

01:13:47.690 --> 01:13:49.424
Hello xenia....

01:13:49.426 --> 01:13:51.025
I've brought someone.

01:13:51.027 --> 01:13:53.961
Her name is ann...

01:13:53.963 --> 01:13:54.962
Hello, ann.

01:13:54.964 --> 01:13:59.767
Hello, ms. Tomassini.

01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:02.904
May we come in?

01:14:02.906 --> 01:14:05.506
Please.

01:14:12.848 --> 01:14:15.850
May I offer you
something to drink?

01:14:15.852 --> 01:14:17.718
A glass of champagne, thank you.

01:14:27.963 --> 01:14:31.232
So, how do you two
know each other?

01:14:31.234 --> 01:14:33.634
Ann is your biggest fan.

01:14:33.636 --> 01:14:36.904
So our paths crossed.

01:14:42.511 --> 01:14:45.913
How have the shows been going?

01:14:45.915 --> 01:14:46.781
Wonderful.

01:14:46.783 --> 01:14:48.182
It's...

01:14:48.184 --> 01:14:50.585
A wonderful situation.

01:14:50.587 --> 01:14:53.120
It's a wonderful play.

01:14:53.122 --> 01:14:56.057
It's beyond wonderful.

01:15:01.597 --> 01:15:03.898
Mimi, may I talk to
you for a moment?

01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:07.034
Yes, of course.

01:15:16.111 --> 01:15:18.579
You can't bring a
virgin into my home.

01:15:18.581 --> 01:15:20.915
A virgin!

01:15:20.917 --> 01:15:22.250
You're around all sorts
of people all the time.

01:15:22.252 --> 01:15:23.918
I really didn't think twice.

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:26.587
I thought you'd be fine with it.

01:15:26.589 --> 01:15:29.790
Not to have alone in my home.

01:15:29.792 --> 01:15:31.926
With the windows closed!

01:15:31.928 --> 01:15:37.865
In my drawing room staring
at me like some sacrifice!

01:15:37.867 --> 01:15:40.801
You've got to get her out!

01:15:40.803 --> 01:15:44.305
I'm sorry, xenia,
I didn't think.

01:15:44.307 --> 01:15:46.107
I haven't tasted
human blood for 40 years.

01:15:46.109 --> 01:15:51.312
It's almost a hundred years
I haven't tasted a virgin!

01:15:51.314 --> 01:15:53.848
It's harder.

01:15:53.850 --> 01:15:56.317
You have to prepare
for these things...

01:15:56.319 --> 01:16:00.788
To know your limits,
what you can bear and...

01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:02.256
What you can't.

01:16:02.258 --> 01:16:06.661
This is not acceptable!

01:16:06.663 --> 01:16:08.062
I understand.

01:16:08.064 --> 01:16:10.998
Finish your glass of champagne
and say you have to go.

01:16:12.067 --> 01:16:15.002
May I please have
a glass of water?

01:16:15.004 --> 01:16:17.204
Of course.

01:16:17.206 --> 01:16:21.809
I'll get it.

01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:32.186
You're so beautiful.

01:16:32.188 --> 01:16:36.657
Even more beautiful
without make-up.

01:16:36.659 --> 01:16:38.793
Oh, well, thank you darling.

01:16:38.795 --> 01:16:41.062
That's very sweet.

01:16:50.072 --> 01:16:52.073
And what do you do?

01:16:52.075 --> 01:16:53.674
I'm a student.

01:16:53.676 --> 01:16:55.943
Of course.

01:16:55.945 --> 01:16:58.813
Of course, you are.

01:17:00.882 --> 01:17:03.017
I first saw you in medea.

01:17:03.019 --> 01:17:08.255
It changed my life.

01:17:08.257 --> 01:17:10.725
I don't mean to be strange...

01:17:10.727 --> 01:17:15.930
But I have always felt that
we were destined to meet.

01:17:15.932 --> 01:17:17.932
When mimi picked me out of
the crowd the other night...

01:17:17.934 --> 01:17:20.401
And asked me if I'd
want to meet you...

01:17:20.403 --> 01:17:23.671
I was surprised,
of course I was.

01:17:23.673 --> 01:17:28.342
But part of me wasn't.

01:17:30.345 --> 01:17:32.413
Drink your water, ann.

01:17:32.415 --> 01:17:36.283
We have to be going soon.

01:17:47.095 --> 01:17:48.295
Oh no!

01:17:48.297 --> 01:17:51.132
Did you cut your
lip on the glass?

01:17:51.134 --> 01:17:53.067
There must have been a chip.

01:17:53.069 --> 01:17:56.937
Crystal chips so easily.

01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:01.008
Are you alright?

01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:01.742
Yeah.

01:18:01.744 --> 01:18:03.277
It's fine.

01:18:03.279 --> 01:18:06.080
I have another appointment.

01:18:06.082 --> 01:18:08.416
Don't leave yet.

01:18:08.418 --> 01:18:13.287
You can't leave,
bleeding like that.

01:18:13.289 --> 01:18:14.955
Perhaps ann can stay
until her bleeding stops.

01:18:14.957 --> 01:18:17.892
Yes.

01:18:17.894 --> 01:18:20.027
But I have to go myself.

01:18:20.029 --> 01:18:22.096
Stay until it stops.

01:18:22.098 --> 01:18:25.366
It is destiny.

01:18:25.368 --> 01:18:29.170
Good-bye, xenia.

01:18:32.074 --> 01:18:34.408
Are you sure you don't
want me to take her?

01:18:34.410 --> 01:18:36.077
No...

01:18:36.079 --> 01:18:43.150
We'll have a glass of
champagne and a nice talk.

01:18:43.152 --> 01:18:46.821
Bye-bye.

01:18:46.823 --> 01:18:49.890
Bye-bye.

01:19:57.292 --> 01:20:00.494
No one knows and
no one has to know.

01:20:00.496 --> 01:20:04.832
I know how it is.

01:20:04.834 --> 01:20:07.902
I can help you
take care of this.

01:20:07.904 --> 01:20:11.438
If you have a saw, I
can do it in the bathtub.

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:14.909
I'm happy to help.

01:20:14.911 --> 01:20:20.915
But there is something
we need to talk about.

01:20:20.917 --> 01:20:22.049
I can't go to phoenix, xenia.

01:20:27.389 --> 01:20:30.991
I'm all packed.

01:20:33.595 --> 01:20:34.395
Before you get on
that plane with me,

01:20:34.397 --> 01:20:36.430
And we do this...

01:20:36.432 --> 01:20:39.366
There's something I
need to tell you.

01:20:39.368 --> 01:20:42.236
What is it?

01:20:42.238 --> 01:20:45.973
I could stay in
the estate for now.

01:20:45.975 --> 01:20:50.311
But what I'd really like to
do is have a place here

01:20:50.313 --> 01:20:52.179
In the city.

01:20:52.181 --> 01:20:53.981
Do you think you could
arrange that for me, xenia?

01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:05.459
You're the best.

01:21:36.057 --> 01:21:39.059
There's something I
need to tell you as well.

01:21:43.531 --> 01:21:45.933
Yeah?

01:21:49.938 --> 01:21:52.606
Your agent...

01:21:59.047 --> 01:22:01.048
She did?

01:22:01.050 --> 01:22:04.051
No.

01:22:04.053 --> 01:22:06.186
She didn't.

01:22:17.599 --> 01:22:21.068
It was me.

01:22:24.539 --> 01:22:26.340
That one was me.

01:25:41.703 --> 01:25:44.438
Putain!

01:26:52.907 --> 01:26:59.780
Are you the maid?

01:26:59.782 --> 01:27:01.315
Thank god...

01:27:01.317 --> 01:27:03.917
Help me...

01:27:06.387 --> 01:27:09.990
Help me inside!

01:27:23.004 --> 01:27:26.940
Help me!

01:27:26.942 --> 01:27:29.943
Help me!

01:27:34.315 --> 01:27:36.984
I will, madame.

01:27:36.986 --> 01:27:38.318
Have a wonderful performance.

01:27:43.258 --> 01:27:43.657
Are you ready?

01:27:43.659 --> 01:27:46.593
Yes.

01:27:51.666 --> 01:27:54.334
Thank you, irene.

01:27:54.336 --> 01:27:58.672
My pleasure, madame.

01:28:07.615 --> 01:28:08.415
I think we've got everything.

01:28:08.417 --> 01:28:09.883
Thank you, irene.

01:28:09.885 --> 01:28:13.854
Thank you so much
for everything.

01:28:13.856 --> 01:28:16.323
I hope we'll meet again soon.

01:28:16.325 --> 01:28:20.661
Thank you for taking care of us.

01:28:20.663 --> 01:28:22.929
Safe travels, madame.

01:28:22.931 --> 01:28:24.965
Your plane is ready and waiting

01:28:24.967 --> 01:28:25.932
Good-bye.

01:28:27.435 --> 01:28:29.369
Good-bye.

01:28:32.674 --> 01:28:34.341
Good-bye.
