02:06.084 --> 02:07.585
So what do you think of our new house?

02:07.669 --> 02:09.629
[Marcus]
It's the biggest one on the block!

02:09.712 --> 02:10.880
Can we go in?

02:10.964 --> 02:12.632
[mother] We get the keys on Monday.

02:12.715 --> 02:14.342
You're gonna have your own room.

02:14.425 --> 02:16.594
Your baby sister's
going to have her own room.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.096
[father] Hm-mm. Which one is yours?

02:18.179 --> 02:19.472
[Marcus] The middle one!

02:19.556 --> 02:21.808
-[Marcus] And that one can be a playroom.
-[father] Yeah?

02:21.891 --> 02:22.976
[Marcus] That's my sister's.

02:23.059 --> 02:24.352

-I don't know.
-[woman] Really?

02:35.530 --> 02:38.074
I think you would make for a great story.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.034
Late addition to the ski team,

02:40.118 --> 02:42.537
the favorite to win tomorrow's
national qualifier.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.956
Now, I would not call myself the favorite.

02:45.039 --> 02:47.542
Look, I appreciate your offer. I do.

02:47.625 --> 02:48.626
But I gotta pass.

02:53.381 --> 02:54.883
In case you change your mind.

02:55.675 --> 02:56.843
Good luck tomorrow.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.389
Dude, are you crazy?

03:01.472 --> 03:03.600
I'm not trying to draw
too much attention to myself.

03:03.683 --> 03:05.018
That's how you become a target.

03:05.602 --> 03:06.978
What does that mean?

03:07.729 --> 03:08.563
Nothing.

03:09.105 --> 03:12.567
Anyways, they're only interested because
I'm the black guy on the white team.

03:12.650 --> 03:14.402
[Alana] And the fastest skier.

03:14.485 --> 03:15.737

03:18.990 --> 03:20.241
put yourself out there,

03:20.325 --> 03:22.577
but how many famous black skiers
are there?

03:23.453 --> 03:26.539
Think about how many more there could be
if kids like us...

03:27.290 --> 03:28.416

03:28.499 --> 03:29.334

03:29.417 --> 03:31.920
I'm not trying to be the next Tiger, okay?

03:32.003 --> 03:34.130
I just want to focus on tomorrow's race.

03:35.131 --> 03:36.090

[Alana] Uh-huh. I should get back to work.

03:45.558 --> 03:46.976
-See you later?
-Yeah.

03:52.690 --> 03:55.818
Uh... Oh, I asked for eggs and toast.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.363
-This is not that.

I know Kat blue-balled the shit of you,

she always got my order right.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.161

04:05.245 --> 04:08.623
No. I'm doing my thing

-Good.
-Good.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.103
Good.

05:12.186 --> 05:14.147
We're very grateful for all you've done.

05:15.606 --> 05:17.608
Jenny seems to be recovering well.

05:17.692 --> 05:20.486
But let's cut to the chase.
How long till I skate again?

05:22.655 --> 05:23.656
So...

05:25.450 --> 05:28.619
See how these pins are arranged
and the way the bone is healing?

05:29.203 --> 05:32.415
With physical therapy,
you'll be able to walk without a limp,

05:32.498 --> 05:34.083
maybe run, but...

05:34.876 --> 05:37.545
you won't have the mobility you need
to spin or jump.

05:39.213 --> 05:41.132
Pending a miracle, I just, uh...

05:42.592 --> 05:44.135
I don't see you skating again.

05:46.721 --> 05:50.808
Okay, but that skater in Boise...

05:50.892 --> 05:52.935
Remember? Uh... A--

05:53.019 --> 05:54.729
-Abby somebody.
-Right.

05:54.812 --> 05:58.232
She shattered her femur and then was back
at Nationals the next year.

06:00.777 --> 06:01.778
I'm so sorry.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.451
I'll give you two a minute.

06:18.503 --> 06:20.671
We'll get a second opinion.

06:21.506 --> 06:24.133
There's a great orthopedist in Chicago.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.010
I just read about him.

06:26.094 --> 06:30.390
Plus, we can ask your aunt
for her contacts at Johns Hopkins.

06:30.473 --> 06:31.557
It's okay.

06:33.893 --> 06:37.063
No reason to fly five hours
to get the same answer we got today.

06:38.648 --> 06:39.649
Jenn...

06:40.733 --> 06:42.235
you've got to have a little faith.

06:42.318 --> 06:43.903
Faith? [sobs]

06:45.863 --> 06:48.241
Skating was my entire life.

06:48.324 --> 06:49.784
I didn't go to college.

06:49.867 --> 06:51.494
I have no job prospects.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.831
There's nothing I even know how to do.

06:54.914 --> 06:58.376

to have faith in?

07:09.595 --> 07:10.471

Look, honey, I'm sorry.
I didn't know this was your group.

07:35.413 --> 07:38.583

to my work,

07:38.666 --> 07:41.878

so I thought I could use the support.

I'd pick up my brothers,

09:00.831 --> 09:04.919

she's still not allowed to drive, so...

would amount to much,

stepping it up lately, son.

I don't think we should be satisfied
with 14 percent.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.817
I believe I can move these units
for 895,

11:33.609 --> 11:36.362
which is 23 percent higher
than all the other comps in the area,

11:37.238 --> 11:38.239

I should spearhead

you put into this.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.714
It's just, well,
you've only done rental so far, right?

11:55.673 --> 11:58.551
No. I moved that two-bedroom condo
last week.

11:59.093 --> 12:02.304
Technically, it was Susan's listing,
but I brought the buyers in.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.348
Which is a step in the right direction.

12:04.890 --> 12:09.478
Um, it's just, well,

23:07.552 --> 23:08.428
Right?

23:09.262 --> 23:10.180
Uh, yeah.

23:10.263 --> 23:11.431
It's really dark.

23:11.515 --> 23:13.141
Whatever.<i> </i>Teachers shouldn't wear chokers.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.059
Right?

23:14.643 --> 23:16.520
You don't even have teachers, right?

23:17.270 --> 23:18.772
[girl] But you still get spring break?

23:19.231 --> 23:21.566
I'm going to Puglia with my parents
in a couple of weeks,

23:21.650 --> 23:24.027
which is kind of lame,
but at least I can drink there.

23:24.111 --> 23:25.570
-Sweet.
-[laughs]

23:26.321 --> 23:27.406
Nice.

23:27.489 --> 23:29.783
I'm supposed to go fishing with my dad.

23:30.450 --> 23:32.619
Is Puglia nearby, or is it, like,
in Montana somewhere?

23:34.538 --> 23:36.623
Yeah. Yeah, totally.

23:36.706 --> 23:39.459
-Totally. [laughs]
-So, you're going to Rome, Iowa?

23:39.876 --> 23:41.586
'Cause I hear the fishing is great there.

23:42.712 --> 23:43.713
[Reid laughs weakly]

23:50.053 --> 23:51.555
Whoa, where'd you get those?

23:51.638 --> 23:53.306
You didn't, like, steal them, did you?

23:53.390 --> 23:54.224
No!

23:55.725 --> 23:56.935
Someone gave them to me.

23:59.479 --> 24:01.356
[sighs] Let's play ping-pong.

24:01.898 --> 24:03.108
Yeah.

24:03.191 --> 24:04.025
[whispers] Ping-pong!

24:07.154 --> 24:10.574
Ignore Quinn. Pretty sure her nanny's
taking her to Italy, not her parents.

24:10.657 --> 24:13.034
[chuckles softly]
Thanks for letting me hang out.

24:13.118 --> 24:16.079
I was supposed to see my sister today,
but she flaked on me.

24:17.164 --> 24:20.542
Guess she and Justin are off
in their own little world right now.

24:21.626 --> 24:23.420
I don't know. I saw him here earlier.

24:25.005 --> 24:25.881
What?

24:29.968 --> 24:31.219
This is bullshit.

24:32.012 --> 24:35.182
Well, the rink's closed, right?
So they're probably just at the lodge.

24:36.808 --> 24:38.059
Come on. Let's go.

24:46.151 --> 24:47.194
Um...

24:47.277 --> 24:50.363
Donna, could you check on that apple juice
when you get a chance?

24:50.447 --> 24:52.991
I'll do my best.
I only have one pair of hands.

24:54.576 --> 24:55.660
You know, Donna...

24:56.870 --> 24:57.913
Carol!

24:59.122 --> 25:01.291
Look, I get that you're overworked
and underpaid,

25:01.374 --> 25:05.462
I've been there, but this woman
is laying here all pathetic and vulnerable

25:05.545 --> 25:08.965
with three months' bed rest
in her future if she's lucky.

25:09.049 --> 25:12.302
Do you think you can find it in your heart
to get her some fucking apple juice?

25:12.928 --> 25:13.887
Please?

25:14.346 --> 25:15.514
I'll see what I can do.

25:16.389 --> 25:17.516
Thank you, Donna!

25:18.058 --> 25:19.476
Thank you, Donna!

25:19.976 --> 25:22.562
[laughs] Could have done without
the pathetic and vulnerable,

25:22.646 --> 25:24.189
-but that was--
-[beeping]

25:28.818 --> 25:29.903
[Carol] What is that?

25:30.362 --> 25:31.780
Mandy, hello again.

25:31.863 --> 25:34.616
-Hi.
-[doctor] Let's get you on your left side.

25:34.699 --> 25:36.201
-Why is it doing that?
-[beeping stops]

25:36.284 --> 25:38.245
[doctor]
Your baby's heart rate is too low.

25:38.328 --> 25:40.330
We were hoping
we could keep her in there longer,

25:40.413 --> 25:42.791
but sometimes when there's
not enough amniotic fluid,

25:42.874 --> 25:44.584
the baby goes into distress.

25:44.668 --> 25:46.461
-We're gonna have to do a C-section.
-What?

25:46.545 --> 25:49.172
Can't you wait for her husband
to get here? He's going to be here--

25:49.256 --> 25:50.799
[doctor] Sorry. We have to do this now.

25:51.424 --> 25:52.509
I'll meet you in the OR.

25:54.511 --> 25:56.972
Hey, hey, hey. You got this.
You got this, okay?

25:57.055 --> 25:59.432
Think about how hard
you've fought for this baby.

25:59.516 --> 26:02.811
Okay? It's your baby, okay,
and she's coming out today,

26:02.894 --> 26:05.564
and she's gonna be beautiful,
and I'm gonna be right here.

26:05.647 --> 26:07.899
We're gonna do this together.
I'm not gonna leave you.

26:13.238 --> 26:15.740
Screw it tight
'cause I don't want any accidents.

26:20.579 --> 26:21.871
Yup. That's great.

26:23.832 --> 26:27.252
All right. So now,
how do I find someone on here?

26:28.336 --> 26:30.964
I don't know. Uh, try Facebook?

26:32.173 --> 26:33.008
Oh, yeah?

26:33.091 --> 26:34.926
Great! You will help me.

26:51.192 --> 26:52.694
Now what do I do?

26:54.446 --> 26:56.448
Look, no offense, but...

26:56.531 --> 26:57.824
[man sighs]

26:59.492 --> 27:01.369
Yeah, I'm-- I'm out.

27:03.788 --> 27:04.914
[door opens]

27:05.582 --> 27:06.416
[door closes]

27:09.169 --> 27:10.170
[sighs]

27:23.391 --> 27:25.727
[dance music thumping]

27:33.485 --> 27:34.819
Kat, come on. Get down.

27:34.903 --> 27:36.613
No! Stop! I'm having fun.

27:36.696 --> 27:39.115
-[Kat] Come dance with me.
-Kat, this is ridiculous.

27:39.199 --> 27:43.078
No, it's fun. Come on. Come here.
Look at Twyla. Isn't she beautiful?

27:43.161 --> 27:45.121
Kat, we have Sectionals in a week.

27:45.205 --> 27:47.624
Shut up! Come on! You're being annoying.

27:48.833 --> 27:51.503
Hey! Cut that shit out.
This isn't a trailer park.

27:52.253 --> 27:53.338
Oh.

27:54.214 --> 27:55.382
My bad.

27:58.635 --> 27:59.469
Seriously?

28:01.304 --> 28:02.681
[Gregg laughs]

28:02.764 --> 28:04.182
[knocking on door]

28:05.266 --> 28:06.935
[Kat] I'm having so much fun!

28:07.519 --> 28:10.146
Well, it'll be a little more fun
in a minute.

28:10.939 --> 28:12.899
Are those pills? I have pills.

28:12.982 --> 28:14.943
I have pills. Let me show you my pills.

28:17.362 --> 28:18.613
[Twyla] Sweet!

28:20.281 --> 28:22.033
Wait. No, no, no, no!

28:22.117 --> 28:23.118
-Hey.
-[man] Hey!

28:23.952 --> 28:25.537
What did I say about friends?

28:25.995 --> 28:26.871
Hey, man.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.503
[man] Yo! Drinks.

28:33.586 --> 28:34.421
Have fun.

28:37.841 --> 28:40.218
[Gregg]
Bedroom right there. Drinks right there.

28:43.805 --> 28:46.099
Kat! What the fuck are you doing?

28:46.182 --> 28:49.185
-Chill. It's just prescription.
-That doesn't make me feel better.

28:49.811 --> 28:51.813
What's the matter with you?
That's it! Party's over!

28:51.896 --> 28:53.022
Everybody get out!

28:53.106 --> 28:55.734
No! Stop! I'm having fun.
Why are you being so lame?

28:55.817 --> 28:59.529
I'm sorry. I didn't realize stopping you
from snorting shit was lame.

28:59.612 --> 29:01.573
Plus, I'm finally on good terms
with my dad,

29:01.656 --> 29:03.533
and this isn't gonna keep it that way,
Kat.

29:03.616 --> 29:08.079
Says the guy who's always drunk or high
or doing whatever the fuck he wants!

29:09.247 --> 29:11.291
Baby, where's the champagne I ordered?

29:11.374 --> 29:13.251
I'm going to go check on it, okay?

29:15.211 --> 29:16.379
[knocking on door]

29:23.845 --> 29:24.846
Whoa.

29:26.181 --> 29:27.807
[Drew] What's going on in there?

29:28.433 --> 29:30.894
It's nothing. Just--
You guys can't be here.

29:30.977 --> 29:32.228
You're having a party?

29:33.605 --> 29:35.940
That's why Kat blew me off?

29:36.608 --> 29:38.443
Screw that. Come on, Drew.

29:38.985 --> 29:40.862
You'd better not tell Dad about this.

29:42.113 --> 29:44.783
You want to get out of here?
Get some dinner, maybe?

29:45.325 --> 29:46.868
Actually, I just want to see my dad.

29:51.289 --> 29:52.957
[waiter]
Where would you like this, sir?

29:53.374 --> 29:54.626
What the fuck is this?

29:55.794 --> 29:57.212
-[Alana] Are you ready?
-Yup.

29:59.714 --> 30:02.801
Hey, I thought about what you said,
and you were right.

30:02.884 --> 30:04.677
Somebody's gotta represent.

30:04.761 --> 30:05.970
Might as well be me.

30:07.013 --> 30:08.389
I called that reporter.

30:08.473 --> 30:10.350
I'm doing the interview tomorrow
after the race.

30:10.433 --> 30:13.102
Good for you!
Just don't say anything stupid.

30:14.229 --> 30:16.189
-I can't make any promises.
-[Justin] Marcus!

30:16.272 --> 30:18.983
You've gotta cut off the party upstairs.
No more people, no more booze.

30:19.067 --> 30:22.028
Dude, I'm off. And maybe you should stop
calling in orders.

30:22.111 --> 30:24.030
It's all Kat.
She's been acting weird all day.

30:24.113 --> 30:25.698
Was she okay at work this morning?

30:26.157 --> 30:28.076
Uh, I fired her, like, weeks ago.

30:29.452 --> 30:30.495
Wait.

30:32.080 --> 30:32.956
[scoffs]

30:33.039 --> 30:35.917
Look, man, Kat is upstairs right now
with a bunch of--

30:36.334 --> 30:38.878
I don't know who these people are,
and it's getting out of control.

30:39.587 --> 30:42.924
I'm kind of freaking out right now, man,
and I could really use your help.

30:46.261 --> 30:47.846
All right. Let's go.

30:48.429 --> 30:50.306
-I'll be right back.
-I'm coming, too.

31:02.277 --> 31:03.278
Rena!

31:03.361 --> 31:05.530
Hey! Nice surprise!

31:05.613 --> 31:06.614
[Reggie] Come in.

31:06.698 --> 31:10.076
Yeah, I just-- I had an opening in between
my school stuff and seeing my friends,

31:10.159 --> 31:11.494
so I thought I'd just...

31:13.288 --> 31:16.040
Wow, Dad, are you ever going to unpack?

31:18.626 --> 31:19.544
Oh, and by the way,

31:19.627 --> 31:22.630
I was thinking we should definitely go
on that fishing trip that you mentioned.

31:22.714 --> 31:23.882
Yeah, that'd be great.

31:25.133 --> 31:26.551
Uh, it'd be good to see you.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.053
Good to see me?

31:29.137 --> 31:31.890
Yeah, I was planning on telling you
at dinner next week,

31:31.973 --> 31:33.641
but since you're here...

31:33.725 --> 31:36.102
I got a job in Colorado.

31:38.688 --> 31:40.231
But you just moved here.

31:42.692 --> 31:44.277
You promised you'd stay.

31:44.360 --> 31:48.615
Yeah. Yeah, I know. I know, honey,
but it pays twice as much,

31:48.698 --> 31:50.491
and I just couldn't turn it down.

31:50.575 --> 31:53.036
And it'll be a really good way
to support your skating.

31:53.536 --> 31:55.788
-And hey, that fishing trip--
-Forget about it.

31:57.582 --> 31:58.875
I actually hate fishing.

32:00.043 --> 32:01.294
I was just being nice.

32:06.758 --> 32:07.634
[door closes]

32:07.717 --> 32:08.676
[sighs]

32:08.760 --> 32:11.137
[woman] Okay. Everything's ready.

32:11.220 --> 32:13.431
[woman 2] Levels are looking normal.

32:13.514 --> 32:15.391
[machine beeping]

32:15.475 --> 32:17.101
[indistinct chatter]

32:17.185 --> 32:18.227
What's happening?

32:19.312 --> 32:20.188
[Carol] Um...

32:23.650 --> 32:24.651
[Carol] Uh...

32:26.569 --> 32:27.654
You know, it's...

32:30.198 --> 32:31.240
surgery.

32:32.867 --> 32:33.701
[Mandy sighs]

32:34.452 --> 32:36.287
I can't believe James isn't here.

32:36.371 --> 32:39.248
He's landing in 30 minutes,
and he's coming straight here.

32:39.332 --> 32:40.708
It'll be too late.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.210
[Mandy] What if something happens?

32:42.293 --> 32:43.962
What if the baby doesn't make it?

32:44.045 --> 32:45.755
-Mandy...
-Oh, my God!

32:45.838 --> 32:47.507
-Look at me.
-I don't think I can take that!

32:47.590 --> 32:50.009
Mandy, look at me.
You have to be calm. Stay calm.

32:51.052 --> 32:51.886
I--

32:51.970 --> 32:54.097
I'm gonna sing you a song. Okay?
There's this--

32:54.180 --> 32:57.600
There's a lullaby I used to sing Kat
when she was little, and it always helped.

Carol, why isn't she crying?

33:54.866 --> 33:56.492
Your daughter is going to the NICU.

33:57.243 --> 33:58.703
Carol, go follow her.

33:59.162 --> 33:59.996
Okay.

34:06.711 --> 34:09.005
-[man] Yeah!
-[music thumping]

34:29.358 --> 34:30.568
[Kat] Where's Justin?

34:35.364 --> 34:36.491
Where's Justin?

34:38.743 --> 34:39.702
Hey!

34:40.119 --> 34:41.621
Have you seen Justin?

34:41.704 --> 34:42.789
Your boyfriend left.

34:44.082 --> 34:47.001
Hey, uh, why don't you show me where
the rest of your pills are?

34:50.046 --> 34:51.339
Yeah. Gonna show me.

34:52.799 --> 34:54.175
-[Kat] What? No!
-Show me!

34:59.263 --> 35:00.348
Oh, my Lord.

35:05.228 --> 35:06.479
Dude, this is bad.

35:06.562 --> 35:07.855
Has anyone seen Kat?

35:07.939 --> 35:09.816
[Kat] Give 'em back! Get off!

[both grunt]

35:11.275 --> 35:12.610
[Marcus] Hey, dude!

35:13.319 --> 35:16.739
Hey, hey, hey. You gotta calm down, bro,
okay? We don't want any problems.

35:16.823 --> 35:17.990
Fuck you!

35:19.492 --> 35:20.827
Hey. Leave him alone.

35:21.994 --> 35:23.454
Don't fucking touch me!

35:23.538 --> 35:25.081
[grunts]

35:29.544 --> 35:30.545
[man] Argh!

35:39.470 --> 35:40.471
[Alana] Kat.

35:47.395 --> 35:48.312
[Alana] Come on.

35:56.112 --> 35:57.113
[door closes]

35:57.864 --> 36:00.491
-No! He took my fucking pills!
-I need you to calm down.

36:00.575 --> 36:02.743
-He took my fucking pills!
-I need you to calm down!

36:02.827 --> 36:03.828
[Kat] No! No!

36:03.911 --> 36:05.079
Kat!

36:05.163 --> 36:06.455
Kat, what's going on?

36:07.206 --> 36:08.207
Need them!

36:08.291 --> 36:09.250
[banging on door]

36:09.333 --> 36:10.668
[man] Hotel security!

36:11.294 --> 36:12.545
[Kat] Where are they?

36:12.628 --> 36:14.422
-[banging on door]
-Shit.

36:28.686 --> 36:30.188
Just one fucking sign.

36:31.147 --> 36:32.106
Come on!

36:34.066 --> 36:35.776
[footsteps]

36:35.860 --> 36:38.321
[indistinct conversation]

36:45.578 --> 36:46.495
Jennifer?

36:48.539 --> 36:49.665
[sighs]

36:49.749 --> 36:51.709
Didn't peg you as the religious type.

36:52.210 --> 36:55.838
Oh, I'm not. I just go to bingo night
in the church basement.

36:55.922 --> 36:58.966
Cookies were a little stale,
but I won $25.

36:59.467 --> 37:03.137
Anyway, I was tired of sitting at home,
so I come here.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.556
[sighs]
I am sorry to hear about your injury.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.683
I mean, that's bad luck. Hm-mm.

37:08.684 --> 37:10.436
That's underselling it a bit.

37:12.063 --> 37:13.439
[breath shaking]

37:13.522 --> 37:14.857
Without skating...

37:17.109 --> 37:18.945
my life is basically over.

37:20.112 --> 37:21.280
I understand.

37:23.074 --> 37:27.203
You know, after the Olympics,
I thought, "What? That's all?"

37:28.537 --> 37:32.083
And then I coach, and I ask myself,
"Is <i>this </i>all?"

37:33.292 --> 37:34.293
But you know what?

37:35.795 --> 37:38.422
I've recently come to realize
there must be more.

37:39.757 --> 37:42.468
Everyone can have a new chapter.

37:42.551 --> 37:43.678
Even at my age.

37:52.645 --> 37:53.604
Thanks.

37:59.777 --> 38:00.820
Are you good?

38:00.903 --> 38:02.071
-Yeah.
-Good.

38:02.738 --> 38:05.032
'Cause Dora will give us a ride home.

38:06.075 --> 38:07.076
[Dasha] Okay.

38:13.666 --> 38:16.294
[Dasha] But we will stop at
the grocery store first. Okay?

38:16.377 --> 38:17.211
[Jenn] Okay.

38:17.295 --> 38:18.129
[Dasha] Oh...

38:18.212 --> 38:21.173
do you know how to use the Facebook?

38:26.012 --> 38:27.138
[Mandy] Carol.

38:27.221 --> 38:28.180
How is she?

38:29.056 --> 38:30.057
Stable,

38:30.933 --> 38:32.685
but not out of the woods yet.

38:32.768 --> 38:34.603
They say that she has
a long road ahead of her,

38:35.187 --> 38:36.939
but I have complete faith in her.

38:37.023 --> 38:37.940
[Mandy chuckles softly]

38:38.024 --> 38:40.568
Hey. Mandy told me
how great you were today.

38:40.651 --> 38:41.736
Thank you for being here.

38:42.695 --> 38:43.738
It's no big deal.

38:43.821 --> 38:46.782
[cell phone buzzing]

38:49.076 --> 38:50.286
Justin, hey. What's up?

38:52.121 --> 38:53.497
[James] Are you kidding me?

38:58.377 --> 38:59.879
You know, it was a big deal.

39:00.963 --> 39:04.383
I mean, for starters,
you got that poor nurse

39:04.467 --> 39:07.553
-to bring me apple juice.
-[laughs]

39:07.636 --> 39:08.554
Well...

39:10.806 --> 39:13.059
You deserve
the Woodland Tower Condos account.

39:13.559 --> 39:15.770
What? How many drugs are you on?

39:15.853 --> 39:16.854
[Mandy chuckles]

39:18.981 --> 39:20.149
Screw finesse.

39:21.400 --> 39:22.902
Carol, you get shit done,

39:23.778 --> 39:27.615
and that is a huge asset in real estate,
and I should start appreciating it more.

39:30.493 --> 39:31.452
Thank you.

39:35.206 --> 39:37.083
Well, you have a beautiful baby girl.

39:39.627 --> 39:41.462
Man, you're in for a world of trouble.

39:41.545 --> 39:42.797
[laughs]

39:42.880 --> 39:45.257
Oh! [moans]

39:48.177 --> 39:49.762
You are not gonna believe this.

39:52.973 --> 39:55.810
My dad might actually rip me a new one
for this.

39:56.394 --> 39:57.978
Like, literally.

39:59.021 --> 40:02.108
I'm in a police station in Idaho,
and I'm black.

40:02.858 --> 40:03.692
I win.

40:04.985 --> 40:07.238
Shit, man.
I'm sorry I pulled you into this.

40:08.280 --> 40:10.032
-If I'd known--
-No.

40:10.616 --> 40:11.617
You were right.

40:12.159 --> 40:13.160
Kat was...

40:14.286 --> 40:17.873
You know, I've never seen her act
so wild and crazy like that before.

40:19.750 --> 40:20.626
I have.

40:21.919 --> 40:23.045
A year ago.

40:25.089 --> 40:27.550
This one night, she was at this bar alone,

40:28.134 --> 40:30.803
and I remember seeing her
and thinking she was so...

40:32.346 --> 40:33.222
magnetic.

40:34.014 --> 40:36.350
Not the quiet girl I knew
from around the rink.

40:37.893 --> 40:41.730
We talked for a little while
and then she... kissed me.

40:43.232 --> 40:45.943
Said something about
the universe bringing us together.

40:48.362 --> 40:50.614
Didn't think it was that weird
at the time.

40:50.698 --> 40:52.700
[footsteps approaching, keys jangling]

40:54.368 --> 40:55.327
Davis.

40:55.995 --> 40:56.954
Your dad's up front.

40:58.747 --> 41:01.584
What about him?
I'm sure there's something my dad can do.

41:01.667 --> 41:02.543
Wait, no!

41:02.626 --> 41:05.963
Look, I don't want my boss or my coach
or anybody knowing about this.

41:06.505 --> 41:07.506
Are you sure?

41:09.133 --> 41:10.050
Yeah.

41:12.595 --> 41:14.930
All right.
Well, I'd better go check up on Kat.

41:16.015 --> 41:18.726
My dad not hating me
was nice while it lasted.

41:23.647 --> 41:25.357
Looks like you're staying the night.

41:25.691 --> 41:27.234
It's late. Charges are still pending.

41:27.318 --> 41:30.863
-You'll be processed in the morning.
-Wait! No, officer, I can't stay here.

41:30.946 --> 41:33.532
Listen, I'm on a ski team,
and we have a race tomorrow,

41:33.616 --> 41:35.367
and it's really important.

41:36.285 --> 41:37.453
You're on the ski team?

41:38.454 --> 41:41.040
-[father] <i>This is harassment.</i>
-[officer] <i>Don't give me attitude.</i>

41:41.457 --> 41:44.251
-There's been some misunderstanding.
-That's not what the neighbors said.

41:45.836 --> 41:47.838
My wife and child are in the car
over there.

41:47.922 --> 41:49.423
They can't see this, please.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.091
-Just listen--
-I said hands on the car!

41:51.175 --> 41:52.176
You're under arrest.

41:52.801 --> 41:53.886
[father] Ugh!

41:53.969 --> 41:56.138
-Dad!
-Ssh, honey. I need you to be quiet.

41:56.222 --> 41:58.724
[mother] All right, baby?
Daddy didn't do anything wrong.

41:58.807 --> 42:01.060
It's going to be okay.<i> </i>All right, baby?

42:01.477 --> 42:03.103
[grunts]

42:03.854 --> 42:04.855
Trust me.

42:04.939 --> 42:06.607
Everything's going to be okay.

42:13.739 --> 42:14.740
[sniffs]

42:20.788 --> 42:22.831
It's fine. I'll say I'm with Drew.

42:23.707 --> 42:25.459
Can you come pick me up at home?

42:27.962 --> 42:29.171
Don't worry. I'm alone.

42:57.157 --> 42:59.577
[crunches]

43:11.547 --> 43:12.506
Where's Kat?

43:12.965 --> 43:13.966
[Alana] Taking a bath.

43:14.049 --> 43:16.135
It's the only thing
that would calm her nerves,

43:16.760 --> 43:18.429
but she's definitely still tweaking.

43:21.765 --> 43:22.683
Look...

43:24.101 --> 43:25.728
it's none of my business, but...

43:27.021 --> 43:30.024
how long has she been off her lithium
or whatever she's on?

43:30.107 --> 43:30.941
Lithium?

43:36.322 --> 43:38.282
I think Kat has bipolar.

43:38.949 --> 43:41.201
[scoffs] What are you talking about?

43:42.661 --> 43:45.497
I think she's having a manic episode.

43:46.457 --> 43:49.418
My cousin gets like this
when she's off her medication, too.

43:51.712 --> 43:53.464
Where's Marcus? Did he come back with you?

43:53.881 --> 43:55.090
No, he's still at the station.

43:55.174 --> 43:56.258
What?

43:56.342 --> 43:57.176
Still?

43:58.552 --> 44:00.512
Shit, I gotta go see if I can help him.

You're wrong.

Um...

44:58.195 --> 44:59.321
Sorry about today.

45:00.364 --> 45:01.532
I just--

45:01.615 --> 45:04.451
I wanted to tell you
that my presentation went well.

45:05.244 --> 45:06.286
Um...

45:06.787 --> 45:10.416
Actually, I think I might have
gotten a promotion, so that's good, right?

45:12.543 --> 45:14.002
Uh... Okay, well...
