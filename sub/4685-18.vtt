WEBVTT

00:04.129 --> 00:05.631
Jessie! They're having

00:05.632 --> 00:07.132
a Little Miss Big Apple

00:04.129 --> 00:07.132
beauty pageant!

00:07.258 --> 00:09.886
Could I be in it?

00:10.010 --> 00:11.178
Zuri, beauty pageants

00:11.179 --> 00:12.346
are sexist and

00:10.010 --> 00:12.346
demeaning to women.

00:12.471 --> 00:14.933
How many did you lose?

00:16.350 --> 00:18.686
Three. Now go play.

00:18.811 --> 00:20.813
So wise of you not to let

00:20.814 --> 00:22.815
poor little Zuri into

00:18.811 --> 00:22.815
the beauty pageant.

00:22.941 --> 00:24.821
- Having you as a nanny
- is humiliating enough.

00:27.319 --> 00:28.530
Agatha, I thought

00:28.531 --> 00:29.739
we were friends now.

00:29.864 --> 00:31.174
- (IN BRITISH ACCENT)
- Mates. Chums.

00:31.198 --> 00:33.119
- (IN AMERICAN ACCENT)
- Well, you thought wrong.

00:34.827 --> 00:35.995
I'm just thinking

00:35.996 --> 00:37.162
of Zuri's feelings.

00:37.288 --> 00:38.707
She wouldn't stand

00:38.708 --> 00:40.124
a chance in this pageant

00:37.288 --> 00:40.124
against my Lindsay.

00:40.249 --> 00:41.249
Lindsay!

00:43.335 --> 00:45.504
JESSIE: Whoa.

00:45.630 --> 00:47.423
- Talk about
- beauty and the beast.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.383
- What do you mean?
- Lindsay is lovely.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.116
Having trouble connecting

00:53.117 --> 00:54.847
those dots, are ya?

00:54.973 --> 00:56.975
My point is Lindsay's face

00:56.976 --> 00:58.977
has probably never

00:54.973 --> 00:58.977
made a horse faint.

00:59.101 --> 01:00.875
That horse was

01:00.876 --> 01:02.647
very old, and clearly

00:59.101 --> 01:02.647
weak from lack of oats.

01:03.856 --> 01:05.233
Lindsay's a black belt

01:05.233 --> 01:06.609
in karate.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.128
- Oh, please,
- every kid takes karate.

01:08.152 --> 01:10.032
- Doesn't mean they
- can actually do... (YELLS)

01:15.576 --> 01:16.696
- So Lindsay
- can do karate.

01:18.788 --> 01:19.788
Big deal.

01:19.872 --> 01:21.124
Zuri is beautiful,

01:21.125 --> 01:22.374
and talented,

01:22.500 --> 01:23.835
and the most poised

01:23.836 --> 01:25.169
little girl I've ever met!

01:25.252 --> 01:26.546
I'm stuck in a bucket!

01:26.547 --> 01:27.839
I'm stuck in a bucket!

01:29.590 --> 01:30.716
(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:34.762 --> 01:36.305

01:39.289 --> 01:40.768
third time this week!

01:40.893 --> 01:42.061
I gotta get you

01:42.062 --> 01:43.228
a bucket that's

01:40.893 --> 01:43.228
smaller than your head.

01:43.521 --> 01:45.815
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:49.610 --> 01:50.716
All right.

01:50.717 --> 01:51.821
Let's go home and

01:49.610 --> 01:51.821
butter up your head again.

01:54.281 --> 01:55.554
Then afterwards

01:55.555 --> 01:56.826
we are going to

01:54.281 --> 01:56.826
start practicing.

01:56.951 --> 01:58.786

that's a weird snack,

03:15.780 --> 03:17.907
This coming from a man

03:17.908 --> 03:20.034
who puts chocolate syrup

03:15.780 --> 03:20.034
on his spaghetti?

03:21.493 --> 03:23.287
- I'm thinking
- of patenting that.

03:23.412 --> 03:24.789
I'm gonna

03:24.790 --> 03:26.165
call it "Chocoghetti."

03:28.333 --> 03:29.668
I am doing

03:29.669 --> 03:31.003
an experiment

03:28.333 --> 03:31.003
for my science class.

03:31.129 --> 03:32.889
- I have not yet - fed Whiskers,
- (CHUCKLES)

03:32.964 --> 03:34.298
I call him Whiskers,

03:35.925 --> 03:37.468
for 12 whole hours.

03:37.593 --> 03:39.470
Now, I must record

03:39.471 --> 03:41.346
how long it takes him

03:37.593 --> 03:41.346
to find his food.

03:43.390 --> 03:46.060
Aw, poor Whiskers.

03:46.185 --> 03:47.537
- I can hear his
- tiny stomach grumbling.

03:47.561 --> 03:50.397
Actually, that's me.

03:50.522 --> 03:51.837
That chocoghetti

03:51.838 --> 03:53.151
does not go down

03:50.522 --> 03:53.151
without a fight.

03:56.862 --> 03:58.322
I cannot stand it.

03:59.949 --> 04:01.325
Eat up, my little

04:01.326 --> 04:02.701
beady-eyed friend.

04:02.827 --> 04:04.433
I cannot experiment on

04:04.434 --> 04:06.038
this poor, innocent animal.

04:07.790 --> 04:09.458
- (EXCLAIMS)
- Vermin in my kitchen!

04:09.583 --> 04:10.583
And a rat.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.940
- Get that filthy rodent
- out of here,

04:15.047 --> 04:17.048
- Or you're both going
- down the dumbwaiter shaft!

04:18.759 --> 04:20.480
- Too bad you can't
- experiment on Bertram.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.055
Are you thinking

04:22.055 --> 04:23.514
what I am thinking?

04:23.639 --> 04:25.162
That a minivan really

04:25.163 --> 04:26.684
isn't that much smaller

04:23.639 --> 04:26.684
than a regular van?

04:28.477 --> 04:29.687
It is amazing

04:29.688 --> 04:30.896
you can tie your shoes.

04:32.606 --> 04:33.606
They're Velcro.

04:36.527 --> 04:37.820
So, when Agatha said

04:37.821 --> 04:39.113
Zuri could never

04:36.527 --> 04:39.113
win a beauty pageant,

04:39.238 --> 04:40.781
- suddenly - all I could
- Was yellow!

04:40.906 --> 04:42.116
Don't you mean red?

04:42.241 --> 04:43.702
No, yellow.

04:43.703 --> 04:45.161
I was looking

04:42.241 --> 04:45.161
at her teeth.

04:45.369 --> 04:47.580
I can't believe that

04:47.581 --> 04:49.790
Gollum in a blazer

04:45.369 --> 04:49.790
insulted my sister!

04:49.915 --> 04:51.000
Emma, it's not nice

04:51.001 --> 04:52.084
to insult people.

04:52.210 --> 04:53.378
Now, let's work

04:53.379 --> 04:54.545
on Zuri's interview

04:54.670 --> 04:56.630
- so we can beat the ugly
- out of that she-troll!

04:58.257 --> 04:59.446
Miss Ross,

04:59.447 --> 05:00.634
who is your hero?

05:00.759 --> 05:02.970
Chubby the Bear.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.267
Okay. Let's change

05:07.268 --> 05:09.060
that to George Washington.

05:09.185 --> 05:10.478
If you had one wish,

05:10.479 --> 05:11.770
what would it be?

05:11.896 --> 05:13.168
To marry

05:13.169 --> 05:14.439
Chubby the Bear.

05:18.069 --> 05:19.570
- Let's change that
- to world peace.

05:19.695 --> 05:20.905
Almost no one's

05:20.906 --> 05:22.114
against that.

05:22.240 --> 05:23.449
If you could

05:23.450 --> 05:24.658
have lunch with

05:22.240 --> 05:24.658
one historical figure,

05:24.783 --> 05:26.285
who would it be?

05:26.410 --> 05:27.888
- And please don't say
- Chubby the Bear.

05:27.912 --> 05:30.081
Oh, don't be silly.

05:30.206 --> 05:31.353
It would be Chubby

05:31.354 --> 05:32.499
the Bear's grandfather,

05:32.624 --> 05:33.876
Old Man Chubs.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.471
- This is gonna be - a bigger
disappointment - Than my Christmas bonus.

05:44.762 --> 05:45.993
Okay, Zuri,

05:45.994 --> 05:47.223
we're here to practice

05:44.762 --> 05:47.223
your pageant walk.

05:47.431 --> 05:48.724
Now, remember,

05:48.725 --> 05:50.017
you'll have a poufy dress,

05:50.142 --> 05:51.977
so use cupcake hands.

05:53.000 --> 05:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:00.611 --> 06:02.047
- Last time I saw
- somebody walk like that

06:02.071 --> 06:03.406
Was when Ravi

06:03.407 --> 06:04.740
got hit in the head

06:02.071 --> 06:04.740
with a baseball.

06:06.325 --> 06:07.765
I'm trying

06:07.766 --> 06:09.203
to strut my stuff.

06:09.328 --> 06:10.580
Not that I got

06:10.581 --> 06:11.830
much stuff to strut.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.918
Ha! That's my

06:14.919 --> 06:16.961
so-called "competition"?

06:17.086 --> 06:18.772
- She looks better with
- the bucket on her head!

06:18.796 --> 06:20.756
(LAUGHING)

06:21.882 --> 06:23.259
Every time you laugh,

06:23.260 --> 06:24.635
I expect to look up

06:24.760 --> 06:25.907
and see flying monkeys

06:25.908 --> 06:27.054
and, "Surrender, Dorothy."

06:29.223 --> 06:30.224
One more

06:30.225 --> 06:31.225
crack out of you,

06:31.350 --> 06:32.414
and I'm going

06:32.415 --> 06:33.477
to knock those

06:31.350 --> 06:33.477
veneers in your mouth

06:33.560 --> 06:35.479
from here to Battery Park.

06:37.148 --> 06:38.482
My teeth are real.

06:38.523 --> 06:39.108
Not for long.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.610
Okay, okay, okay.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.004
- Zuri's already - got the beauty part
- Of the pageant won.

06:43.028 --> 06:44.196
And she's gonna

06:44.197 --> 06:45.364
win the talent part, too.

06:45.489 --> 06:46.991
- She's been taking
- piano lessons,

06:47.116 --> 06:48.451
And she'd be

06:48.452 --> 06:49.785
playing Carnegie Hall if

06:47.116 --> 06:49.785
her bedtime wasn't 7:30.

06:49.910 --> 06:53.038
Piano? How boring.

06:53.164 --> 06:54.666
I actually just

06:54.667 --> 06:56.167
dozed off for a moment.

06:56.292 --> 06:57.398
That explains the drool

06:57.399 --> 06:58.502
and bad breath.

06:58.585 --> 06:59.816
I'll show you

06:59.817 --> 07:01.046
tiara-winning talent.

07:01.172 --> 07:03.132
- What are you...
- Hi-yah!

07:03.257 --> 07:04.591
(GRUNTS)

07:04.716 --> 07:06.010
Ow! That bishop

07:06.011 --> 07:07.303
has a pointy hat!

07:12.641 --> 07:13.976
(PLAYING FUR ELISE)

07:16.770 --> 07:18.022
Zuri, that's beautiful!

07:18.147 --> 07:19.837
You're gifted,

07:19.838 --> 07:21.525
you're amazing!

07:21.650 --> 07:22.818
Thank you!

07:22.943 --> 07:25.529

07:25.654 --> 07:26.989
And you can play

07:26.990 --> 07:28.324
without touching the keys.

07:28.532 --> 07:30.132
- Oh, that's not me.
- That's my teacher.

07:31.369 --> 07:32.474
Oh. Well, let's hear

07:32.475 --> 07:33.578
you play it.

07:33.704 --> 07:34.705
Okay.

07:35.706 --> 07:38.042
(PLAYING VERY SLOWLY)

07:41.920 --> 07:43.297
(PLAYS WRONG NOTE)

07:45.132 --> 07:46.300
That's all I know.

07:46.425 --> 07:47.259
- Well, then play
- something you do know.

07:47.385 --> 07:49.157
That's it.

07:49.158 --> 07:50.929
That's all I know.

07:51.055 --> 07:53.308
What? I drop you off for

07:53.309 --> 07:55.559
piano lessons twice a week!

07:51.055 --> 07:55.559
What do you do there?

07:55.642 --> 07:57.371
- Drink apple juice and
- listen to Madame Kishka

07:57.395 --> 07:59.314
Sob about her

07:59.315 --> 08:01.232
no-good ex-boyfriend.

08:01.357 --> 08:03.714
Apparently, he was

08:03.715 --> 08:06.070
playing hopscotch

08:01.357 --> 08:06.070
with other women.

08:06.195 --> 08:08.260
Isn't there any

08:08.261 --> 08:10.324
piano teaching going on

08:06.195 --> 08:10.324
at your piano lesson?

08:10.449 --> 08:11.931
Nope.

08:11.932 --> 08:13.411
Just a lot of crying.

08:13.577 --> 08:15.496
That woman goes through

08:15.497 --> 08:17.415
more tissues than Ravi

08:13.577 --> 08:17.415
watching that dolphin movie.

08:17.581 --> 08:19.396

18:02.290 --> 18:04.000
Stop, stop. Wait.

18:04.001 --> 18:05.710
This is all wrong.

18:05.836 --> 18:07.187
- Because of me, - you now think
- Cheating is okay.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.027
But you said people

18:09.028 --> 18:10.841
do it all the time.

18:10.966 --> 18:12.693
- They do. Luke also - puts chocolate
- On his spaghetti.

18:12.717 --> 18:13.885
That does not

18:13.886 --> 18:15.053
make it right!

18:16.179 --> 18:17.764
Zuri, you're on!

18:17.889 --> 18:19.224
The girl before you

18:19.225 --> 18:20.558
is finishing her

18:17.889 --> 18:20.558
interpretive dance

18:20.684 --> 18:22.769
to the sounds of sea lions.

18:22.894 --> 18:23.917
So you might not

18:23.918 --> 18:24.938
come in last after all.

18:26.272 --> 18:28.003
Thanks.

18:28.004 --> 18:29.734
Something to hold on to.

18:29.860 --> 18:31.236
Zuri, I'm so sorry.

18:31.237 --> 18:32.612
I wish Madame Kishka

18:29.860 --> 18:32.612
had taught you

18:32.737 --> 18:34.578
- more about piano
- and less about heartbreak.

18:34.906 --> 18:36.721
Jessie, I just

18:36.722 --> 18:38.535
got a great idea!

18:38.660 --> 18:40.141
Does it involve

18:40.142 --> 18:41.621
changing our names

18:38.660 --> 18:41.621
and fleeing the country?

18:41.746 --> 18:43.707
- 'Cause I'm way
- ahead of you.

18:43.832 --> 18:45.646
Watch!

18:45.647 --> 18:47.460
I'm gonna win this thing.

18:47.585 --> 18:49.212
- I know you are!
- (CHUCKLING)

18:49.337 --> 18:50.755
She's toast.

18:52.382 --> 18:53.633
(IMITATES SEAL BARKING)

18:58.972 --> 19:00.286
I will now

19:00.287 --> 19:01.599
do an original,

18:58.972 --> 19:01.599
dramatic monologue.

19:01.725 --> 19:03.373
And it's gonna be good,

19:03.374 --> 19:05.020
so get your cameras ready.

19:12.069 --> 19:13.779
Why, Chubby?

19:13.780 --> 19:15.488
Why did you leave me?

19:15.613 --> 19:18.638
I'll never forget the day

19:18.639 --> 19:21.661
you were not in the den

19:15.613 --> 19:21.661
watching the cubs.

19:23.621 --> 19:24.247
Zuri, smile!

19:24.372 --> 19:26.457
Cupcake hands!

19:28.251 --> 19:29.691
- Why am I not
- good enough for you?

19:32.630 --> 19:34.549
Did you find sweeter honey

19:34.550 --> 19:36.467
in the arms of another?

19:38.386 --> 19:40.076
Even though

19:40.077 --> 19:41.765
our life together

19:38.386 --> 19:41.765
was often "grizzly,"

19:41.890 --> 19:43.079
I can't bear

19:43.080 --> 19:44.267
to see you go.

19:46.061 --> 19:48.980
Stay, Chubby, stay!

19:52.650 --> 19:53.860
And scene.

20:00.408 --> 20:02.452
Zuri!

20:02.453 --> 20:04.495
That was something!

20:06.081 --> 20:08.166
Where did that come from?

20:08.291 --> 20:10.377
It's what Madame Kishka

20:10.378 --> 20:12.462
cries about during

20:08.291 --> 20:12.462
my piano lessons.

20:12.587 --> 20:14.964
I just substituted

20:14.965 --> 20:17.341
Chubs for her no-good

20:12.587 --> 20:17.341
ex-boyfriend, Leopold.

20:17.467 --> 20:18.719
Well, first of all,

20:18.720 --> 20:19.970
great job!

20:20.095 --> 20:21.263
And second of all,

20:21.264 --> 20:22.430
we're getting you a

20:20.095 --> 20:22.430
new piano teacher.

20:24.933 --> 20:26.831
Well, that was

20:26.832 --> 20:28.728
the silliest thing

20:24.933 --> 20:28.728
I've ever seen.

20:28.853 --> 20:31.174
- Apparently - you haven't looked
- In the mirror recently.

20:32.190 --> 20:33.651
You walked right

20:33.652 --> 20:35.110
into that one.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.070
MAN: (ON PA)

20:37.071 --> 20:38.905
Ladies and gentlemen,

20:35.234 --> 20:38.905
it's crowning time.

20:39.030 --> 20:40.282
Our new Little

20:40.283 --> 20:41.532
Miss Big Apple is...

20:42.325 --> 20:44.161
Susie Gunter!

20:44.285 --> 20:45.285
(BARKING)

20:46.955 --> 20:48.581
ALL: Sea lion girl?

20:48.706 --> 20:50.897
I didn't know they were

20:50.898 --> 20:53.086
giving points for crazy.

20:53.211 --> 20:54.651
Well, at least there's

20:54.652 --> 20:56.089
a silver lining.

20:56.214 --> 20:58.113
Since neither of us won,

20:58.114 --> 21:00.010
neither of us has to dress up

20:56.214 --> 21:00.010
like a monkey.

21:00.135 --> 21:01.886
Wait a minute.

21:02.012 --> 21:03.076
You said,

21:03.077 --> 21:04.139
"Whoever loses."

21:04.347 --> 21:04.931
And you both lost.

21:05.056 --> 21:07.976
Now you listen to me?

21:08.101 --> 21:11.021
- Where were you when - I said having
a pen pal - In juvie was a bad idea?

21:12.856 --> 21:14.191
For once, I agree

21:14.192 --> 21:15.525
with the twit from Texas.

21:15.650 --> 21:17.235
- Thank you.
- Wait. Rude.

21:19.403 --> 21:21.656
So, what you're teaching us

21:21.657 --> 21:23.908
is that it's okay to

21:19.403 --> 21:23.908
break your promises?

21:24.034 --> 21:25.994
That's a fine lesson for two

21:25.995 --> 21:27.954
impressionable little girls.

21:33.376 --> 21:34.419
This is actually

21:34.420 --> 21:35.461
kind of fun.

21:35.586 --> 21:36.776
Which is a sad commentary

21:36.777 --> 21:37.964
on the rest of your life.

21:39.216 --> 21:40.738
Okay, I'm see no evil,

21:40.739 --> 21:42.260
and hear no evil.

21:42.385 --> 21:43.469
You're just evil.

21:47.557 --> 21:49.184
Isn't that half hour up yet?

21:49.392 --> 21:50.914
Oh, yeah. It was up

21:50.915 --> 21:52.436
a long time ago.

21:55.232 --> 21:57.472
- We just wanted - to see how red
- Your faces would get.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.237
- I guessed
- as red as a tomato.

22:00.403 --> 22:01.988
I guessed fire truck.

22:02.113 --> 22:03.344
I went with

22:03.345 --> 22:04.574
baboon butt!

22:06.117 --> 22:07.244
Let's get 'em.

22:07.410 --> 22:09.037
- For once,
- I agree with Hagatha.

22:14.959 --> 22:17.003
My legs are numb.

22:17.712 --> 22:19.047
- I can't even
- feel my legs.

22:20.965 --> 22:22.113
Should we run?

22:22.114 --> 22:23.260
What if they catch us?

22:23.426 --> 22:24.657
Please. Madame Kishka

22:24.658 --> 22:25.887
has a better chance

22:23.426 --> 22:25.887
of catching a husband.
