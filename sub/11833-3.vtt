WEBVTT

00:00.801 --> 00:02.235
Previously on "The Practice"...

00:02.836 --> 00:05.606
Aah! Ooh!

00:05.639 --> 00:07.641
Some guy stabbed me.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.543
Guy?

00:09.576 --> 00:13.747
Yeah, some guy
in a nun suit.

00:13.780 --> 00:16.717
You can help prevent
a big miscarriage here.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.451
Get out!

00:18.484 --> 00:20.086
This integrity
of the robe thing,

00:20.120 --> 00:21.622
that's just a bunch
of crap!

00:21.655 --> 00:23.056
I never had a gun.

00:23.089 --> 00:24.490
I was just
going down the stairs!

00:24.525 --> 00:25.559
Bailiff, take him out.

00:25.592 --> 00:26.627
For the rest of the trial,

00:26.660 --> 00:28.629
his hands are cuffed
to the chair

00:28.662 --> 00:30.263
and his mouth is taped.

00:30.296 --> 00:31.732
Your honor, that would be
so prejudicial!

00:31.765 --> 00:33.366
It's not up for debate!

00:33.399 --> 00:35.769
We find the defendant
not guilty.

00:39.405 --> 00:40.507
Marry me.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.208
Marry you?

00:42.242 --> 00:43.644
I love you,

00:43.677 --> 00:46.079
and I want
to be your husband.

00:46.112 --> 00:47.714
I'm going to move in
with Bobby.

00:47.748 --> 00:48.815
But I'm going to
have to move out.

00:48.849 --> 00:50.150
I can't swing that place
on my own.

00:50.183 --> 00:51.618
You can find
another roommate.

00:51.652 --> 00:53.119
I'm looking
at the moment,

00:53.153 --> 00:55.121
and I thought maybe
on a temporary basis --

00:55.155 --> 00:57.157
think Elleanor and I
are a good match?

00:57.190 --> 00:59.392
Look, she dates men
who cut off heads,

00:59.425 --> 01:00.694
I have this thin
little neck --

01:00.727 --> 01:02.462
Okay, that's really funny.

01:02.495 --> 01:04.730
See? You're already
bickering -- roommates.

01:55.782 --> 01:56.750
Lucy?

01:56.783 --> 01:58.351
Aah!

01:58.384 --> 02:00.320
Oh, god, you scared me.

02:00.353 --> 02:01.321
I'm sorry.

02:01.354 --> 02:02.756
Bobby, look at this.

02:02.789 --> 02:03.890
It's a nun holding
the Boston Herald

02:03.924 --> 02:05.458
with yesterday's date.

02:05.491 --> 02:06.727
What?

02:06.760 --> 02:08.360
Look.

02:08.394 --> 02:09.763
He's still out there.

02:09.795 --> 02:11.765
The nun that stabbed Lindsay,
he's not dead.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.600
Bobby, do you see that
that's yesterday's date?

02:13.634 --> 02:14.768
Calm down.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.770
Don't tell me
to calm down!

02:16.803 --> 02:17.604
Why is he doing this?

02:17.638 --> 02:21.307
What is this,
some kind of threat?

02:21.341 --> 02:23.243
What are you doing?

02:23.276 --> 02:24.678
Check the background.

02:24.711 --> 02:27.380
You'll see that lamp
on Jimmy's desk.

02:27.413 --> 02:29.249
That picture
was taken here.

02:29.282 --> 02:30.784
What?

02:30.817 --> 02:33.787
He knows how to get in.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.789
That's great.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.391
He's alive...

02:38.424 --> 02:40.827
With his own key.

02:40.961 --> 02:44.164
â™ª

03:31.745 --> 03:33.346
It could be a copycat.

03:33.379 --> 03:34.948
It could, but this
doesn't exactly fit

03:34.981 --> 03:36.550
a copycat profile.

03:36.583 --> 03:37.884
It fits
joey heroics' profile.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.620
He would love
to taunt us this way.

03:39.653 --> 03:40.687
You blame Joey Heric
for everything.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.689
How would he get a key?

03:42.723 --> 03:44.457
Isn't it possible
the lock was picked?

03:44.490 --> 03:46.326
Doesn't look like it.

03:46.359 --> 03:47.728
Are you telling me
that the guy who stabbed me

03:47.761 --> 03:49.262
might still be out there?

03:49.295 --> 03:51.264
Never mind out there, Lindsay.
How about in here?

03:51.297 --> 03:52.498
Okay, let's not panic.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.334
That's easy for you to say.
You're not the one he's after.

03:54.367 --> 03:57.638
It's got to be connected
to that nun killer case.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.005
What else could it be?

04:12.786 --> 04:13.754
Six months.

04:13.787 --> 04:14.621
I got to serve?

04:14.655 --> 04:15.421
Ronnie --

04:15.455 --> 04:17.524
But she darted out
in front of me.

04:17.558 --> 04:18.858
I wasn't even speeding.

04:18.892 --> 04:21.361
The problem is
you fled the scene.

04:21.394 --> 04:22.896
Then I turned myself in.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.898
Doesn't that count
for something?

04:24.931 --> 04:28.368
If you want to try it,
we can try it.

04:28.401 --> 04:29.803
I'm ready,
the prosecution's ready.

04:29.836 --> 04:31.738
But if we lose at trial,

04:31.772 --> 04:35.475
you could get two
to three years.

04:35.509 --> 04:37.678
My recommendation
is we take the deal.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.348
All right.

04:42.382 --> 04:44.585
They'll call us up soon.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.489
We don't necessarily think
it's the same guy.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.925
This firm has had a lot
of high-profile cases

04:51.958 --> 04:53.927
where you put murderers
back on the street,

04:53.960 --> 04:55.929
the highest profile
being that nun case.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.331
Also, Lindsay's attack
got a lot of media attention.

04:58.364 --> 05:00.033
I thought you said
this wasn't a copycat.

05:00.066 --> 05:01.802
I said it didn't fit
the profile.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.770
It could be someone
that hates this firm

05:03.804 --> 05:05.506
and is using
the nun motif to,

05:05.539 --> 05:06.873
well, dramatic effect.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.076
So what your saying is,
you don't have a clue.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.414
So, what's going to be done?

05:14.948 --> 05:16.482
We'll investigate, Bobby,

05:16.517 --> 05:18.418
but we don't even have
a death threat here.

05:18.451 --> 05:20.120
I won't lie and say you'll get
tremendously high priority.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.655
Great.

05:21.688 --> 05:23.924
Changing the locks would be
a good place to start.

05:23.957 --> 05:26.560
You're moving in
with me tonight.

05:26.593 --> 05:28.428
Do you still
have your gun?

05:28.461 --> 05:29.930
Unless he took it.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.865
No, I've got it.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.668
Let's not overreact here.

05:34.701 --> 05:35.602
Overreact?

05:35.636 --> 05:38.038
There's some psycho
targeting us, Jimmy.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.840
And you think a gun's
going to be the answer?

05:39.873 --> 05:41.842
Well, maybe not,
but if it is,

05:41.875 --> 05:43.710
I want it to be
in my hand.

05:43.744 --> 05:47.614
I'd say this guy
is already winning.

05:52.619 --> 05:56.122
WOMAN: 30501 --
commonwealth vs Ronald Vega,

05:56.156 --> 05:57.724
reckless driving,

05:57.758 --> 05:59.560
leaving the scene
of an accident.

05:59.593 --> 06:02.495
Another police conspiracy,
counselor?

06:02.529 --> 06:04.665
No, your honor.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.399
Your honor, we've reached
a tentative agreement,

06:06.432 --> 06:08.101
subject to the approval
of the court.

06:08.134 --> 06:09.570
Let's hear it.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.538
One second, your honor.
I need a moment.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.510
I'm sorry.
The agreement is off.

06:16.543 --> 06:17.611
What?

06:17.644 --> 06:19.880
Something you'd like
to share

06:19.913 --> 06:21.014
with the rest of us?

06:21.047 --> 06:22.683
Your honor,
Elizabeth Nicklen,

06:22.716 --> 06:23.750
the victim,
died this morning

06:23.784 --> 06:25.118
from a ruptured spleen.

06:25.151 --> 06:26.687
Because the case
now involves a homicide --

06:26.720 --> 06:27.754
Homicide?

06:27.788 --> 06:28.889
It was
an injury sustained

06:28.922 --> 06:30.423
in the accident.

06:30.456 --> 06:31.491
In light
of the new circumstances,

06:31.525 --> 06:32.793
the commonwealth would like

06:32.826 --> 06:34.795
to withdraw
the plea offer agreement,

06:34.828 --> 06:36.462
add the vehicular homicide
to the charges,

06:36.496 --> 06:37.764
and move forward.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.432
You can't be serious.

06:39.465 --> 06:41.802
Bond set at $75,000.
Take him into custody.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.469
This is outrageous!

06:43.504 --> 06:45.506
Yes, well, given the fact
that your client confessed,

06:45.539 --> 06:47.808
I suggest you get together
with the D. A.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.610
And work out a plea.

06:49.643 --> 06:50.977
RONNIE:
I need to talk to you.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.078
I'll be back there
in a second.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.146
Ms. Washington!

06:53.179 --> 06:55.448
I'll be there in a second.

06:56.683 --> 06:57.684
What the hell?

06:57.718 --> 06:59.052
The doctors
connect the death

06:59.085 --> 07:00.654
with the accident, Bec.

07:00.687 --> 07:02.923
It's not like I have
much of a choice.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.157
I'll give you five.

07:04.190 --> 07:05.191
Five years?

07:05.225 --> 07:06.627
That's a deal.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.061
Vehicular plus
leaving the scene --

07:08.094 --> 07:10.063
Swack would pin him
with eight minimum.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.666
He might not even
sign off on five.

07:12.699 --> 07:16.937
Let's have it recalled.
We'll get rid of it.

07:19.706 --> 07:22.208
I have to talk
to my client first.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.692
The offer
is now five years.

07:38.725 --> 07:39.793
I didn't do it.

07:39.826 --> 07:41.962
The doctors evidently
can connect the injuries --

07:41.995 --> 07:44.965
I didn't hit her.
I wasn't driving the car.

07:45.932 --> 07:47.067
What are you talking about?

07:47.100 --> 07:48.234
Teddy Barrington --

07:48.268 --> 07:49.836
he's this big
real estate guy.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.672
I detail his car.
He hit her.

07:51.705 --> 07:52.472
He was drinking.

07:52.506 --> 07:53.974
He paid me to say
that I did it.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.942
Wait, wait, wait a second
Ronnie.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.711
I didn't do it
Ms. Washington.

08:00.847 --> 08:03.917
Somebody else is paying you
to take the fall?

08:03.950 --> 08:04.918
Yes.

08:04.951 --> 08:06.086
How much?

08:06.119 --> 08:07.921
$30,000, plus $10,000

08:07.954 --> 08:09.923
for each month
I had to serve.

08:09.956 --> 08:11.925
But five years? No way.

08:11.958 --> 08:15.028
I'm not doing five years.

08:15.061 --> 08:16.830
Ronnie,
you signed a confession.

08:16.863 --> 08:21.568
But I didn't do it!

08:21.602 --> 08:23.937
Okay.

08:23.970 --> 08:26.039
Okay.

08:26.773 --> 08:28.942
Is there any way
we can prove this?

08:28.975 --> 08:30.844
Do you have an alibi?

08:30.877 --> 08:32.846
No. It was late at night,

08:32.879 --> 08:34.948
and I was home sleeping
when he called.

08:34.981 --> 08:36.950
But if you go
to my apartment,

08:36.982 --> 08:39.318
look in my closet.
You'll find the money.

08:39.352 --> 08:42.589
Ms. Washington...

08:42.623 --> 08:44.991
I wasn't driving
that car.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.896
This is exactly
what you want --

08:49.930 --> 08:52.933
got your auto recoil,
small, easy to conceal.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.901
Well it would
fit in my purse.

08:54.935 --> 08:56.069
Yeah, but what about if I
drop it?

08:56.102 --> 08:57.738
It's not going to go
off is it?

08:57.771 --> 08:58.872
Best safety lock made.

08:58.905 --> 08:59.906
How much?

08:59.940 --> 09:00.841
Six fifty.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.075
That's a lot of money.

09:02.108 --> 09:03.710
Pay him.

09:03.744 --> 09:04.778
$500.

09:04.811 --> 09:06.146
I don't dicker.

09:06.179 --> 09:08.148
Look, you can't
buy this anywhere,

09:08.181 --> 09:10.150
it's illegal
for you to own it,

09:10.183 --> 09:12.152
and they don't give out
carry permits.

09:12.185 --> 09:13.787
Ellenor.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.756
Okay.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.260
Okay, here.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.629
Gives you any trouble,
call me.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.164
Thanks, Phil.

09:24.197 --> 09:26.199
Have a safe day.

09:32.372 --> 09:34.140
I don't know whether
to be happy I have a gun

09:34.174 --> 09:36.342
or appalled that you could
buy them on the street.

09:36.376 --> 09:38.144
Well, look at it this way --

09:38.178 --> 09:40.814
one less gun to fall
into the wrong hands.

09:40.847 --> 09:42.015
You know, maybe I should
learn how to shoot it.

09:42.048 --> 09:43.750
There are plenty
of places for that.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.085
There's not much kick on it,

09:45.118 --> 09:46.219
so it won't be that hard.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.621
Have you ever fired yours?

09:47.654 --> 09:50.657
Only in target practice,
except for that guy.

09:50.691 --> 09:53.594
Oh, yeah,
I forgot about that.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.869
It sounds a little like
a tall tale, Rebecca.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.838
Yes, it does,
with one exception.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.210
Not a bribe.

10:10.243 --> 10:13.379
This is evidence --
$30,000.

10:13.413 --> 10:16.049
He also promised to pay him
an extra $10,000

10:16.082 --> 10:18.318
for each month
he spent in jail.

10:18.351 --> 10:19.886
No witnesses?

10:19.920 --> 10:22.155
No, but I ran
Barrington's priors.

10:22.188 --> 10:23.023
He has two DUI's.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.691
And your client
has two cocaine priors.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.326
Maybe he got
this money dealing.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.228
He has been straight,
sober, and honest

10:28.261 --> 10:29.630
for six years.

10:31.732 --> 10:34.801
Well, we'll talk
to this Barrington guy.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.169
Can I be there?

10:37.938 --> 10:39.840
Please.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.407
Okay.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.677
But listen, Rebecca,

10:43.710 --> 10:45.145
if I find we're being put
through the ringer on this,

10:45.178 --> 10:47.147
I'm taking five years
off the table

10:47.180 --> 10:48.749
and I'm pushing for eight.

10:48.782 --> 10:51.017
You think
I'm putting you on?

10:51.051 --> 10:52.686
I think he might be.

11:04.464 --> 11:06.166
George?

11:06.199 --> 11:08.034
Ellenor, what are you
doing with a gun?

11:08.068 --> 11:09.435
Never mind.
What are you doing

11:09.469 --> 11:10.771
crashing into people
on the sidewalk?

11:10.804 --> 11:11.838
I wasn't crashing.

11:11.872 --> 11:12.939
You were walking
with your head down.

11:12.973 --> 11:14.307
What are you doing here?

11:14.340 --> 11:15.776
Well, I was coming by
to say hi,

11:15.809 --> 11:16.943
but I'm certainly
rethinking that,

11:16.977 --> 11:18.178
given the sound
of your voice.

11:18.211 --> 11:19.780
I'm sorry.

11:19.813 --> 11:21.848
What the hell are you
doing with a gun?

11:21.882 --> 11:23.784
Our office is being
terrorized by some wacko.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.485
We're all just
a little jumpy.

11:25.519 --> 11:26.753
But a gun? You?

11:26.787 --> 11:29.022
What you should be doing
is moving,

11:29.055 --> 11:30.056
getting out
of that apartment.

11:30.090 --> 11:31.057
It's a bad neighborhood.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.325
It's already taken care of.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.126
I'm moving in
with Helen Gamble.

11:33.159 --> 11:35.295
It's Beacon Hill.
It's very safe.

11:35.328 --> 11:36.930
I still want a gun.

11:36.963 --> 11:38.231
He's been
terrorizing you how?

11:38.264 --> 11:41.234
It's just --
it's a long story,

11:41.267 --> 11:43.236
and I'm late
for a depo, so --

11:43.269 --> 11:45.872
How about we get dinner?
You can tell me then.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.040
Yeah, great. Okay.

11:47.073 --> 11:49.042
It would have to be
an early one.

11:49.075 --> 11:51.044
Uh, 5:30.
Let's say Angelino's?

11:51.077 --> 11:53.313
Great.
You'll be coming armed?

11:53.346 --> 11:56.750
That's cute.
I'll see you.

12:01.487 --> 12:03.089
When Ronnie
returned the car,

12:03.123 --> 12:03.957
I noticed
he looked rattled.

12:03.990 --> 12:05.291
How do you mean rattled?

12:05.325 --> 12:06.760
Nervous, fidgety,

12:06.793 --> 12:08.028
so I decided
to check the car out

12:08.061 --> 12:09.095
before I paid him.

12:09.129 --> 12:11.464
And that's when you saw the
damage to your car?

12:11.497 --> 12:13.233
Yes, and it was
at that time

12:13.266 --> 12:15.235
that he told me
what he had done.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.103
I was upset with him
at first.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.505
He started to cry.

12:18.539 --> 12:20.841
He was very distraught
about the whole situation.

12:20.874 --> 12:23.777
Whose idea was it
to call the police?

12:23.810 --> 12:24.978
It was mine.

12:25.011 --> 12:27.247
I told him that
either now or later,

12:27.280 --> 12:29.783
the police were going
to have to be told.

12:29.816 --> 12:31.151
I also made it very clear

12:31.184 --> 12:33.153
that if he voluntarily
turned himself in,

12:33.186 --> 12:34.888
the D. A. Might be
more forgiving.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.322
Did you go anywhere

12:36.356 --> 12:38.324
while Mr. Vega
had your car?

12:38.358 --> 12:40.326
No. I stayed at home.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.394
Was anyone with you?

12:41.427 --> 12:43.229
My wife.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.498
Why were you getting
your car detailed at night?

12:45.532 --> 12:47.500
I typically
have it done at night

12:47.534 --> 12:49.770
Because that's
when I'm not using it.

12:51.437 --> 12:54.240
All of a sudden
I get the feeling

12:54.274 --> 12:56.543
I'm the one
being investigated.

12:56.577 --> 13:00.881
Mr. Vega claims that
you're paying him $30,000

13:00.914 --> 13:03.249
to take the fall for you --

13:03.283 --> 13:05.251
that you hit
Elizabeth Nicklen,

13:05.285 --> 13:06.920
not him.

13:08.922 --> 13:11.491
You're not
taking him seriously?

13:14.127 --> 13:17.497
Then this interview's over.

13:23.403 --> 13:24.470
Out of a van?

13:24.505 --> 13:25.906
What difference
does it make where?

13:25.939 --> 13:26.840
What difference
does it make?

13:26.873 --> 13:27.941
Yes, It's a 30-day wait
in Massachusetts.

13:27.974 --> 13:30.343
We got a guy dressing up
as a nun sending us threats.

13:30.376 --> 13:31.612
We're supposed
to wait a month?

13:31.645 --> 13:33.246
That's the law.

13:33.279 --> 13:34.247
There's a law against
stabbing people, too.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.248
Oh, please.

13:35.281 --> 13:36.917
What, oh, please?

13:36.950 --> 13:39.219
We're lawyers, Lindsay,
members of the bar.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.054
That goes for you, too.
We don't commit crimes.

13:41.087 --> 13:42.989
And you buying that gun
off of god knows who --

13:43.023 --> 13:44.525
-It was a client.
-It's against the law.

13:44.558 --> 13:46.593
You complain every day
we're not doing enough

13:46.627 --> 13:49.195
to legitimize ourselves,
what if you get caught carrying?

13:49.229 --> 13:50.597
You could get disbarred.
Did you think about that?

13:50.631 --> 13:51.598
Did you?

13:51.632 --> 13:53.166
Oh, Bobby, shut up.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.268
JIMMY:
All right, let's all --

13:55.301 --> 13:57.370
The fact that we're engaged

13:57.403 --> 13:59.940
doesn't mean I'm not
still senior partner.

13:59.973 --> 14:02.643
You don't speak to me
like that in here.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.144
Then let's step outside

14:04.177 --> 14:05.011
You know, come on.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.580
-Quite.
-Stay out of it.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.589
-Hey.
-Hey.

14:17.323 --> 14:19.626
Sit.

14:19.660 --> 14:24.397
I don't like
the sound of that.

14:24.430 --> 14:26.032
Barrington's wife
backed him up --

14:26.066 --> 14:28.134
said he was home
the whole time.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.403
Well, what did you expect?
She's his wife.

14:30.436 --> 14:33.473
Let's talk about what
you expect, Rebecca.

14:33.507 --> 14:36.109
Jennifer, say what
you have to say.

14:36.142 --> 14:39.145
We're pressing forward
against Vega.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.681
I'm telling you --

14:40.714 --> 14:42.415
we have
a signed confession.

14:42.448 --> 14:43.684
He was paid
to give that.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.318
Which we can't prove.

14:45.351 --> 14:47.688
And that is what this
is all about, isn't it?

14:47.721 --> 14:50.156
The only case
you'll be able to prove

14:50.190 --> 14:51.592
is against Vega.

14:51.625 --> 14:53.326
Why even
investigate Barrington?

14:53.359 --> 14:55.428
Because
with Ronnie's testimony,

14:55.461 --> 14:56.997
he represents automatic
reasonable doubt.

14:57.030 --> 14:57.998
Rebecca.

14:58.031 --> 14:59.399
Give him a lie detector.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.334
Not admissible,
and you know it.

15:01.367 --> 15:03.136
But it's accurate.

15:03.169 --> 15:06.707
Rebecca, we're going
forward against Vega.

15:06.740 --> 15:09.075
It comes from above.

15:09.109 --> 15:11.712
Because a woman is dead

15:11.745 --> 15:15.481
and somebody needs
to be convicted, that it?

15:17.751 --> 15:23.323
All the evidence we have
points to Vega.

15:31.431 --> 15:34.334
Mr. Barrington's wife
will provide an alibi.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.402
They're moving forward
against you.

15:36.436 --> 15:39.039
Ronnie, I think
we should just try it.

15:39.072 --> 15:41.407
You convinced me.
You persuade one juror,

15:41.441 --> 15:43.677
we've got reasonable doubt.
Now, we can impound --

15:43.710 --> 15:45.612
I've decided to stick
with my confession,

15:45.646 --> 15:47.080
Ms. Washington.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.183
I'm sorry?

15:50.216 --> 15:52.452
It was me.
I hit the woman.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.621
I've decided to stick
with my confession.

15:54.655 --> 15:56.189
Let that be that.

15:56.222 --> 15:57.624
Wait a second.

15:57.658 --> 15:59.492
You're going back to saying
you drove the car?

15:59.526 --> 16:01.261
Yes.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.434
You had
any visitors here?

16:11.572 --> 16:12.973
Anybody here to see you?

16:13.640 --> 16:15.275
Mr. Barrington's attorney.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.711
He came to ask why
I was accusing somebody else

16:17.744 --> 16:19.279
of doing what I did.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.647
How much?

16:20.681 --> 16:23.183
How much are they
offering you this time?

16:23.216 --> 16:25.185
He appealed
to my conscience.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.721
You can't do this.

16:27.754 --> 16:29.289
This is a homicide.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.725
I don't care how much
they're offering you.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.293
This will ruin your life.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.629
For god's sake,
listen to me!

16:35.662 --> 16:37.297
My life will be ruined?

16:37.330 --> 16:39.299
Do you know
the first thing

16:39.332 --> 16:41.034
about my life,
Ms. Washington?

16:41.067 --> 16:43.570
My parents were dead
when I was 9.

16:43.604 --> 16:45.371
I never
finished high school.

16:45.405 --> 16:48.775
I make about $11,000 a year
if I'm lucky.

16:48.809 --> 16:51.377
Going to prison
may be the best way

16:51.411 --> 16:53.379
to prevent me
from becoming a criminal.

16:53.413 --> 16:55.381
You're a criminal
right now

16:55.415 --> 16:57.784
if you do
what you're talking about.

16:57.818 --> 17:00.453
I hit the woman.
You have my confession.

17:04.825 --> 17:07.492
What do you expect me
to do about it?

17:07.528 --> 17:09.663
Well, I want
to be let off.

17:09.695 --> 17:12.232
A lawyer can't knowingly
defraud the court.

17:12.265 --> 17:14.267
You don't know anything.
You suspect.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.269
Your honor, I know.

17:16.301 --> 17:17.503
So what?

17:17.538 --> 17:19.138
I take you off the case,

17:19.172 --> 17:20.807
he just lies
to his next lawyer.

17:20.840 --> 17:22.776
He marches in here
with some ignoramus,

17:22.809 --> 17:26.146
and the court is no better
protected against fraud.

17:26.179 --> 17:28.414
Most attorneys wouldn't
give a damn anyway.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.350
How did you get
to be so cynical?

17:30.383 --> 17:32.819
I'm not cynical, counsel,
I'm annoyed.

17:32.853 --> 17:35.421
My day was supposed
to end 20 minutes ago.

17:35.455 --> 17:36.823
Oh, forgive me.

17:36.857 --> 17:38.559
I'm sure you have a nice
bowel movement planned

17:38.592 --> 17:41.294
and you want to get to it,
give your day some meaning?

17:42.328 --> 17:45.566
Have you been listening
to what I'm saying?

17:45.599 --> 17:47.834
A kid has been bought off

17:47.868 --> 17:50.837
to take a homicide wrap
in your court.

17:50.871 --> 17:52.706
If that doesn't bother you,

17:52.739 --> 17:54.841
then don't tell me
you're not cynical

17:54.875 --> 17:57.578
or jaded or even putrid
for that matter.

18:02.348 --> 18:04.818
I will reject
the kid's guilty plea.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.321
Thank you.

18:08.354 --> 18:11.191
He will have a trial
whether he likes it or not,

18:11.224 --> 18:12.893
and you will be his lawyer.

18:12.926 --> 18:14.227
Me? I can't.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.829
Yes, you can.

18:15.862 --> 18:18.565
I may have to be a witness
Because of what I heard.

18:18.599 --> 18:20.567
I'll decide that
as I go along.

18:20.601 --> 18:21.868
We impanel in the morning.

18:21.902 --> 18:23.136
He'll just fire me.

18:23.169 --> 18:24.571
I won't let him.

18:24.605 --> 18:27.574
In the interests of justice
and non-cynicism,

18:27.608 --> 18:28.775
you're the best lawyer
for the job.

18:28.809 --> 18:30.744
Your honor --

18:30.777 --> 18:31.712
9:00, counsel.

18:31.745 --> 18:32.813
You delay my bowel movement
one more second,

18:32.846 --> 18:34.380
I'll hold you in contempt.

19:08.281 --> 19:11.518
Yes. It's an emergency.

19:11.552 --> 19:15.656
I think there's somebody
in my apartment.

19:16.356 --> 19:18.759
I put a little piece
of tape on at lunchtime.

19:18.792 --> 19:19.860
It's broken.

19:19.893 --> 19:21.795
And you don't have
a maid or a super?

19:21.828 --> 19:23.797
No, no. Nobody goes
in there but me.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.799
And nobody's come out
since you arrived.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.433
No.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.469
Okay, let's go in.

20:15.348 --> 20:16.382
Men: police! Freeze!

20:16.416 --> 20:18.384
Aah!

20:18.418 --> 20:20.286
Roberta.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.922
Get out.

20:21.955 --> 20:24.725
Get out, all of you!

20:24.758 --> 20:25.826
Judge Kittleson?

20:25.859 --> 20:28.595
Out!

20:28.629 --> 20:31.565
Get out!

20:31.598 --> 20:32.699
Let's go.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.772
Uh, what...

20:38.805 --> 20:43.510
I came to surprise you.

20:43.544 --> 20:45.579
Oh.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.280
Worked.

20:57.390 --> 21:00.727
-Naked, naked?
-Yes. Naked, naked.

21:00.894 --> 21:03.496
She was standing there naked
nude to surprise me

21:03.530 --> 21:05.832
and they busted in with guns.

21:05.866 --> 21:07.500
What did she say?

21:07.534 --> 21:09.770
Not much. She gathered
her stuff and left.

21:09.803 --> 21:11.404
Won't take my calls.

21:11.437 --> 21:12.973
We can wait till the end
of the week if it's easier.

21:13.006 --> 21:14.641
No, it's fine.

21:14.675 --> 21:16.409
Ellenor's going to move in
with Helen today,

21:16.442 --> 21:18.779
so I'll need to sleep
at your place tonight.

21:18.812 --> 21:21.381
Sounds romantic.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.052
I gotta go to court.

21:26.086 --> 21:27.921
I'm second chairing
Rebecca.

21:28.789 --> 21:32.058
He's been here again.
He held this.

21:33.994 --> 21:35.929
He held it.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.931
He had a certain smell,
a cologne.

21:37.964 --> 21:41.034
This is it.
No, this is no copycat.

21:41.067 --> 21:42.669
It's him.

21:42.703 --> 21:44.538
I don't smell anything.

21:44.571 --> 21:45.706
It's him.

21:51.444 --> 21:52.946
When we got there,
he was crying.

21:52.979 --> 21:53.947
The defendant.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.081
Yes. He said
he'd hit a woman

21:55.115 --> 21:56.449
who was crossing the street

21:56.482 --> 21:57.984
and that he'd panicked
and drove off.

21:58.018 --> 22:00.420
Was anybody with him
when you arrived?

22:00.453 --> 22:01.822
Yes, a Mr. Theodore Barrington,

22:01.855 --> 22:03.423
the owner of the car.

22:03.456 --> 22:05.091
And were you able
to establish

22:05.125 --> 22:06.893
Mr. Barrington's connection
with all this?

22:06.927 --> 22:08.128
Basically, the defendant

22:08.161 --> 22:10.130
was detailing
Mr. Barrington's car,

22:10.163 --> 22:12.766
and when driving it home,
the defendant hit the woman.

22:12.799 --> 22:15.769
He told Mr. Barrington
about it, and evidently,

22:15.802 --> 22:18.605
Mr. Barrington convinced him
to notify us.

22:18.639 --> 22:20.707
Did you look into
whether Mr. Barrington

22:20.741 --> 22:23.076
was driving the car himself?

22:23.109 --> 22:24.845
I'm told he was
questioned later.

22:24.878 --> 22:26.580
My question is,

22:26.613 --> 22:29.115
did you look
into this possibility?

22:29.149 --> 22:30.116
No.

22:30.150 --> 22:31.518
Why not?

22:31.552 --> 22:33.119
Because the kid
confessed to it.

22:33.153 --> 22:35.121
Are you aware
that the defendant claimed

22:35.155 --> 22:37.991
he was paid $30,000
by Mr. Barrington?

22:38.024 --> 22:39.059
Objection!

22:39.092 --> 22:40.126
Overruled.

22:40.160 --> 22:41.528
I made that up.

22:41.562 --> 22:42.729
Mr. Vega, take your seat.

22:42.763 --> 22:43.730
Judge, I told --

22:43.764 --> 22:46.432
I said take your seat
and close your mouth,

22:46.466 --> 22:47.534
or I'll have it taped shut.

22:47.568 --> 22:50.070
And if you don't think
I'll do it, ask your lawyer.

22:50.103 --> 22:51.638
I don't want her
to be my lawyer.

22:51.672 --> 22:53.540
I'll give you
one last warning.

22:53.574 --> 22:55.909
Look, I just want
to plead guilty.

22:57.944 --> 23:00.881
Okay, detective Simons,
I'll ask you again.

23:00.914 --> 23:03.449
Are you aware
that my client claimed

23:03.483 --> 23:06.452
he was paid $30,000
by Mr. Barrington

23:06.486 --> 23:08.822
to say
he was driving the car?

23:08.855 --> 23:10.891
I was not aware of that
at the time.

23:10.924 --> 23:12.458
I was made aware
of that this morning,

23:12.492 --> 23:13.894
but I was told
that the defendant

23:13.927 --> 23:15.161
has since retracted
the statement.

23:15.195 --> 23:17.197
Are you aware his subsequent
retraction came

23:17.230 --> 23:20.000
after Mr. Vega was paid
a visit to his cell

23:20.033 --> 23:21.635
by Mr. Barrington's
attorney?

23:21.668 --> 23:23.637
I was not aware of that, no.

23:23.670 --> 23:27.040
Thank you, detective.
That's all.

23:27.073 --> 23:29.009
Your honor,

23:29.042 --> 23:30.644
the commonwealth
calls Ronald Vega.

23:30.677 --> 23:32.646
Objection, your honor.
My client

23:32.679 --> 23:34.581
has a fifth amendment right
not to testify.

23:34.615 --> 23:35.649
I think
if you removed the tape

23:35.682 --> 23:37.083
from Mr. Vega's mouth,

23:37.117 --> 23:39.920
you'll learn
that he waives that right.

23:49.563 --> 23:51.532
What were you thinking?

23:52.132 --> 23:53.934
Is that why you came,

23:53.967 --> 23:55.936
to compound
my humiliation?

23:55.969 --> 23:58.204
Because believe me,
it's not possible.

23:58.238 --> 24:00.941
Roberta,
I didn't know you and I

24:00.974 --> 24:03.844
were speaking romantically
much less...

24:03.877 --> 24:07.948
I find it difficult
to tell a man I miss him.

24:07.981 --> 24:09.583
For whatever reason,

24:09.616 --> 24:11.952
it's just easier
to show up

24:11.985 --> 24:14.087
in his apartment naked.

24:14.888 --> 24:17.023
My god.

24:17.057 --> 24:20.193
How can I ever
make eye contact

24:20.226 --> 24:22.495
with people again?

24:22.529 --> 24:25.832
Oh, you said that when
you were on the internet.

24:25.866 --> 24:27.668
You got over it.

24:27.701 --> 24:30.837
This is much worse.
I was standing there naked.

24:30.871 --> 24:35.208
I can't even imagine
what people must think.

24:35.241 --> 24:38.211
Why do you care
what they think?

24:38.244 --> 24:40.781
You're always saying
when you put that robe on,

24:40.814 --> 24:42.248
you're a judge.

24:42.282 --> 24:44.718
It's so important
that everybody think of you

24:44.751 --> 24:46.853
as a great judge
with integrity.

24:46.887 --> 24:49.255
Part of being
a good judge

24:49.289 --> 24:52.593
is the appearance
of dignity.

24:52.626 --> 24:55.596
So they walked in
on your personal life.

24:55.629 --> 24:59.165
That doesn't make you any less
dignified professionally.

24:59.199 --> 25:01.267
You weren't doing
anything illegal.

25:01.301 --> 25:04.070
It was a big mistake.

25:04.104 --> 25:05.939
And know what they're
all talking about, Roberta?

25:05.972 --> 25:11.011
Your body,
how great it is.

25:13.279 --> 25:14.981
Really?

25:15.015 --> 25:18.251
I wasn't calling you
over and over last night

25:18.284 --> 25:21.822
just 'cause I felt bad
for you.

25:21.855 --> 25:26.292
You got me
a little worked up.

25:26.326 --> 25:30.897
I'm not happy
I walked in there

25:30.931 --> 25:34.100
with the police seeing you
like that.

25:34.134 --> 25:37.904
I'll be honest.
I was shocked,

25:37.938 --> 25:41.908
but I was glad to see you.

25:41.942 --> 25:45.245
I've missed you, too.

26:03.797 --> 26:05.331
Okay.

26:05.365 --> 26:07.568
Thanks.

26:08.168 --> 26:09.803
That was Mcguire.
No leads yet,

26:09.836 --> 26:11.638
but the fact that he's
Become bolder like this,

26:11.672 --> 26:13.206
they consider him dangerous.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.941
Gee.

26:14.975 --> 26:17.944
Look, I think
we should get a guard.

26:17.978 --> 26:19.680
Can I talk to you?

26:19.713 --> 26:21.081
Go ahead.

26:21.114 --> 26:23.083
In my office.

26:28.822 --> 26:30.223
What have I done
to deserve this?

26:30.256 --> 26:31.357
You've done absolutely
nothing, Bobby.

26:31.391 --> 26:32.325
I'm getting this

26:32.358 --> 26:34.194
Because I don't like you
buying illegal guns?

26:34.227 --> 26:35.161
It doesn't make any sense.

26:35.195 --> 26:36.129
You're getting this
for always judging me,

26:36.162 --> 26:37.097
I'm not judging you,

26:37.130 --> 26:38.331
Judging me when you have
absolutely no idea.

26:38.364 --> 26:39.199
-what you're talking about.
-But I'm entitled to an opinion,

26:39.232 --> 26:39.766
one of which being
the attorneys here

26:39.800 --> 26:41.835
shouldn't break the law.

26:41.868 --> 26:42.636
What do you think Elleanor
or I should do, Bobby,

26:42.669 --> 26:44.938
expect the police
to protect us?

26:44.971 --> 26:47.207
Go to court,
get a restraining order --

26:47.240 --> 26:49.776
all murderers stay away,
one-mile radius?

26:49.810 --> 26:51.878
Expect you to protect me?

26:51.912 --> 26:53.313
Okay, that was personal.
You're attacking me again.

26:53.346 --> 26:54.380
This is about
some anger with me.

26:54.414 --> 26:56.950
No, you're the one who
started the attack on me.

26:56.983 --> 26:58.218
Lindsay, what the hell
is going on?

26:58.251 --> 27:00.887
I've got scars, Bobby.
You want to see them?

27:00.921 --> 27:02.322
And they still hurt.

27:02.355 --> 27:04.424
Oh, here we go.

27:04.457 --> 27:05.959
Here we go?

27:05.992 --> 27:08.328
Look, Lindsay, I know
what you went through.

27:08.361 --> 27:09.963
I understand.

27:09.996 --> 27:11.798
You know
what I went through.

27:11.832 --> 27:13.066
If you want --

27:13.099 --> 27:14.735
I got stabbed three times.

27:14.768 --> 27:16.236
Somebody took a knife

27:16.269 --> 27:18.238
and stuck it into me
three times.

27:18.271 --> 27:20.406
It went through muscle
and ligaments and arteries.

27:20.440 --> 27:23.810
I was on that floor dying,
and you think you know?

27:23.844 --> 27:25.879
You know, you give me
an engagement ring,

27:25.912 --> 27:28.414
you think it will make it
all go away?

27:28.448 --> 27:29.349
Will you marry me?

27:29.382 --> 27:31.752
That's supposed to
just heal everything.

27:31.785 --> 27:33.153
I almost died,

27:33.186 --> 27:36.156
and you can't bring yourself
to talk about it!

27:36.189 --> 27:38.158
I need to talk about it!

27:38.191 --> 27:40.727
A week later
you're wondering

27:40.761 --> 27:42.896
how many people
we should invite.

27:42.929 --> 27:45.899
We can't pretend it never
happened now, okay?

27:45.932 --> 27:47.300
He's out there, he's back,

27:47.333 --> 27:49.302
and he's come
into this office,

27:49.335 --> 27:52.438
and I can smell him!
And I can smell him!

27:52.472 --> 27:54.040
I can smell him.

27:54.074 --> 27:55.308
Okay, okay.

27:55.341 --> 27:56.910
I can smell him.

27:56.943 --> 27:57.911
All right.

27:57.944 --> 27:59.445
I can smell him.

27:59.479 --> 28:02.683
(crying)

28:06.820 --> 28:07.921
Living room or bedroom?

28:07.954 --> 28:10.924
Uh, you can leave it
right there.

28:10.957 --> 28:12.325
Oh, two more.

28:12.358 --> 28:13.927
George, take a break.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.829
Two more,
then I'll collapse.

28:16.362 --> 28:17.463
What's the dish, Elleanor?

28:17.497 --> 28:19.065
No guy carries
that many boxes

28:19.099 --> 28:19.800
without expecting to get

28:19.833 --> 28:21.301
a little something
in return.

28:21.334 --> 28:23.403
Sorry to disappoint you.
Just a friend.

28:23.436 --> 28:25.338
Oh, come on. Roommates
are supposed to share

28:25.371 --> 28:26.807
their little sexual secrets.

28:26.840 --> 28:28.875
I sleep
with this football player.

28:28.909 --> 28:31.344
He comes over
with his poodle.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.980
The dog likes to lick
my toes during.

28:36.282 --> 28:38.118
Just kidding.

28:38.919 --> 28:41.522
For a second,
I felt safer on the street.

28:41.555 --> 28:43.156
No, seriously, Elleanor.

28:43.189 --> 28:45.992
No guy is interested
in being just friends,

28:46.026 --> 28:47.961
not even a loser
like George.

28:47.994 --> 28:49.530
Shh?

28:49.563 --> 28:51.532
Look, the truth is,
under these circumstances,

28:51.565 --> 28:53.534
it's not the worst thing
in the world

28:53.567 --> 28:55.802
to have a male friend
close by.

28:55.836 --> 28:56.970
No, especially one
who can cut off heads.

28:57.003 --> 28:58.038
Would you shut up?

28:58.071 --> 28:59.405
Look, I'm sorry.
He's weird, okay?

28:59.439 --> 29:02.042
I'm not as convinced as
you are that he's innocent.

29:02.075 --> 29:03.409
Will you just unpack?

29:03.443 --> 29:06.079
Look at you,
already bossing me around.

29:07.447 --> 29:09.415
Where do you want that?

29:09.449 --> 29:12.886
Just leave it right there.

29:17.290 --> 29:20.326
Mr. Vega, under oath,

29:20.360 --> 29:21.895
is it your testimony

29:21.928 --> 29:23.897
that you struck
Elizabeth Nicklen

29:23.930 --> 29:26.166
while driving
Teddy Barrington's car?

29:26.199 --> 29:26.967
Yes.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.335
You turned yourself
into police.

29:29.369 --> 29:32.172
You signed
a full confession.

29:32.205 --> 29:33.339
Yes.

29:33.373 --> 29:35.275
Now, did you tell
your attorney

29:35.308 --> 29:36.910
that Mr. Barrington
paid you

29:36.943 --> 29:38.344
for a false confession?

29:38.378 --> 29:40.814
Yeah,
but I was lying to her.

29:40.847 --> 29:43.249
He never paid me.

29:43.283 --> 29:44.551
I hit the woman,

29:44.585 --> 29:47.187
and I'm accepting
responsibility.

29:47.220 --> 29:49.022
So you were just lying to me

29:49.055 --> 29:51.892
when you told me
you were paid to confess.

29:51.925 --> 29:53.927
That's right.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.295
And you suddenly
changed your story

29:55.328 --> 29:57.197
after getting a visit
from Mr. Barrington's attorney,

29:57.230 --> 29:58.464
didn't you, Ronnie?

29:58.498 --> 30:00.266
'cause he appealed
to my conscience,

30:00.300 --> 30:02.435
plus, you know,
I don't want to be sued

30:02.468 --> 30:04.037
for false
accusing somebody.

30:04.070 --> 30:05.371
I see.

30:05.405 --> 30:08.308
You first told me
he paid you $30,000,

30:08.341 --> 30:11.945
and then you told me
to go to your apartment.

30:11.978 --> 30:13.313
And when I did,

30:13.346 --> 30:15.315
sure enough,
I found almost $30,000.

30:15.348 --> 30:17.317
Your honor,
I have to object.

30:17.350 --> 30:18.952
She's giving testimony here.

30:18.985 --> 30:20.921
If she's going
to be a witness --

30:20.954 --> 30:22.055
let's just
get through this.

30:22.088 --> 30:23.323
A lawyer can't stand --

30:23.356 --> 30:25.225
Overruled.

30:25.258 --> 30:26.326
Where did the $30,000
come from?

30:26.359 --> 30:27.594
Savings.

30:27.628 --> 30:29.029
Savings?

30:29.062 --> 30:31.297
Ronnie,
you made $11,000 a year

30:31.331 --> 30:33.867
in your best year.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.301
You saved up $30,000?

30:35.335 --> 30:37.303
Yes.

30:37.337 --> 30:38.872
You have an account

30:38.905 --> 30:40.306
at commonwealth savings bank
totaling $703.

30:40.340 --> 30:42.509
Why not put the $30,000
in a bank?

30:42.543 --> 30:44.044
It was illegal gains.

30:44.077 --> 30:45.879
Illegal how?

30:45.912 --> 30:46.947
I refuse to answer that

30:46.980 --> 30:48.214
on grounds
it could incriminate me.

30:48.248 --> 30:50.050
But you have a conscience,
Ronnie,

30:50.083 --> 30:51.618
and you're
of the confessing mind.

30:51.652 --> 30:53.319
-Objection.
-Sustained.

30:53.353 --> 30:55.989
When you told me you were
being paid to confess

30:56.022 --> 30:58.058
and I was trying to
talk you out of doing that,

30:58.091 --> 30:59.593
you said I couldn't know you.

30:59.626 --> 31:01.628
These are attorney/client
communications.

31:01.662 --> 31:03.429
Counselor,
you're lucky enough

31:03.463 --> 31:06.066
to have a scum ball here
who's willing to confess.

31:06.099 --> 31:09.235
Why don't you sit
and be happy with that?

31:09.269 --> 31:11.237
You said that $30,000
plus $10,000

31:11.271 --> 31:13.239
for every month
you'd spend in jail,

31:13.273 --> 31:15.175
that's more money
than you'd ever know.

31:15.208 --> 31:17.343
You said
that going to prison,

31:17.377 --> 31:19.345
getting this money
might actually prevent you

31:19.379 --> 31:21.548
from Becoming a criminal.
That was all just a lie?

31:21.582 --> 31:23.249
Yes.

31:23.283 --> 31:24.651
You're lying now,
aren't you, Ronnie?

31:24.685 --> 31:26.386
No.

31:26.419 --> 31:28.288
Taking the fall
for a homicide --

31:28.321 --> 31:30.290
I bet you're getting
a lot for that.

31:30.323 --> 31:33.393
It was me driving the car.

31:33.426 --> 31:35.529
Why aren't you
looking at me, Ronnie?

31:35.562 --> 31:37.130
I'll look at you,

31:37.163 --> 31:39.132
but you're just
some ambitious bitch

31:39.165 --> 31:41.668
doing I don't know what
or why.

31:41.702 --> 31:43.269
I guess that's it.

31:43.303 --> 31:44.671
I'm just
some ambitious bitch

31:44.705 --> 31:46.272
standing up here

31:46.306 --> 31:48.575
who you're having trouble
looking at.

32:05.325 --> 32:06.392
Hey, you sure you don't
want to stay for dinner?

32:06.426 --> 32:07.260
I'm going to the market,

32:07.293 --> 32:08.529
and I can get you
whatever you like.

32:08.562 --> 32:09.696
Thank you,
but believe it or not,

32:09.730 --> 32:10.731
I actually
have plans tonight.

32:10.764 --> 32:13.466
Oh, really?
You have a hot date?

32:13.499 --> 32:18.605
Are you making fun
of me, Elleanor?

32:18.639 --> 32:23.076
Uh, no.
Actually, I wasn't.

32:23.109 --> 32:24.578
Well, I thank you
for the offer,

32:24.611 --> 32:26.146
but I do have plans.

32:26.179 --> 32:28.214
Well, I thank you
for all the help.

32:28.515 --> 32:30.016
Do you want
to walk me out?

32:34.721 --> 32:36.957
Sure.

32:44.631 --> 32:47.433
This is the craziest trial
I've ever heard of.

32:47.467 --> 32:50.336
We have the defendant
saying he's guilty

32:50.370 --> 32:52.706
while his lawyer
says he's not.

32:52.739 --> 32:54.541
I've been acting
like a witness,

32:54.575 --> 32:56.442
offering facts into evidence,

32:56.476 --> 32:59.379
and a lot of it has been
attorney/client privilege,

32:59.412 --> 33:02.348
and all the while we have
your honor up there,

33:02.382 --> 33:05.552
taping my client's mouth,
calling him scum.

33:05.586 --> 33:07.621
We have more grounds
for appeals --

33:07.654 --> 33:09.656
this is the trial court,
counsel.

33:09.690 --> 33:12.225
You can make
your appeals later.

33:14.160 --> 33:17.664
Maybe he doesn't care
about Ronnie,

33:17.698 --> 33:19.666
but I bet he cares

33:19.700 --> 33:23.103
about the integrity
of this room.

33:23.136 --> 33:26.239
I hope you care about it.

33:26.272 --> 33:28.675
Ronald Vega doesn't.

33:28.709 --> 33:31.645
He accepted money
to be bought off the truth.

33:31.678 --> 33:34.080
He spits on this room.

33:34.114 --> 33:37.150
He spits on me,
the judge, on you.

33:37.183 --> 33:38.519
You don't represent me!

33:38.552 --> 33:40.687
Mr. Vega!

33:40.721 --> 33:42.656
You want to rot in jail
for cash,

33:42.689 --> 33:44.691
it's not just your business.

33:44.725 --> 33:46.259
It's mine and it's their's,

33:46.292 --> 33:50.130
and I won't be bought off...

33:50.163 --> 33:53.433
And I doubt you will be,
either.

33:53.466 --> 33:57.070
You took an oath
to uphold the law

33:57.103 --> 33:58.705
and find the truth,

33:58.739 --> 34:02.142
and we all know
the truth here, don't we?

34:02.175 --> 34:06.930
Ronald Vega
wasn't driving that car.

34:11.417 --> 34:13.786
If we can't convict
with a confession,

34:13.820 --> 34:16.255
then something
is definitely wrong

34:16.289 --> 34:17.623
with the system.

34:17.658 --> 34:19.626
All the evidence,
all of it,

34:19.659 --> 34:22.629
supports
Mr. Vega's confession.

34:22.663 --> 34:28.368
A woman is dead here,
ladies and gentlemen.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.370
Ms. Washington may choose

34:30.402 --> 34:33.373
to characterize this trial
as a farce,

34:33.406 --> 34:35.809
but a human life was lost,

34:35.842 --> 34:39.478
and we have an admission
from the man responsible.

34:40.880 --> 34:42.815
If you were to acquit
on the basis

34:42.849 --> 34:46.820
of the defense counsel's
opinion,

34:46.853 --> 34:51.784
well, then we would have
a farce...

34:53.426 --> 34:56.329
Wouldn't we?

35:08.341 --> 35:09.576
You all set?

35:09.610 --> 35:12.312
I still have a lot
of work to do, actually.

35:12.345 --> 35:14.414
Well, I'm not
leaving you here alone.

35:14.447 --> 35:16.783
I have a gun, remember?

35:19.720 --> 35:22.589
Lindsay...

35:22.623 --> 35:24.324
I'm sorry.

35:24.357 --> 35:27.327
You just seemed
to recover so fast,

35:27.360 --> 35:29.329
it didn't occur to me

35:29.362 --> 35:32.533
what should have been
so obvious.

35:32.566 --> 35:35.335
I'm okay, Bobby.

35:35.368 --> 35:38.605
No. We're not going to
make that mistake again

35:38.639 --> 35:40.907
and just assume you're okay.

35:40.941 --> 35:43.343
You were almost killed.

35:43.376 --> 35:45.345
It's going to take
a long time

35:45.378 --> 35:46.747
before that trauma
goes away.

35:51.384 --> 35:52.719
You're right.

35:52.753 --> 35:55.355
I was just happy
to move forward

35:55.388 --> 35:57.624
and pretend
it was all behind us.

35:57.658 --> 36:01.294
That's what I do.

36:01.327 --> 36:04.565
I like to believe
everything's okay.

36:07.601 --> 36:10.937
But I can't do that here.

36:19.846 --> 36:22.448
I am so sorry.

36:29.856 --> 36:32.826
It's just...

36:32.859 --> 36:38.431
Him still being out there...

36:38.464 --> 36:42.569
Just brings it all back.

36:42.603 --> 36:47.440
I just keep thinking...

36:47.473 --> 36:49.442
What if he's caught ever?

36:49.475 --> 36:52.846
He goes to triaL...

36:52.879 --> 36:56.449
I'd have to testify.

36:56.482 --> 37:01.855
I don't think
I could handle it.

37:01.888 --> 37:06.459
It was just so much easier

37:06.492 --> 37:11.397
with him being dead.

37:11.431 --> 37:15.468
I just want him dead.

37:25.478 --> 37:27.981
The jury's reached
its verdict?

37:28.014 --> 37:29.716
We have, your honor.

37:29.750 --> 37:31.785
The defendant
will please rise.

37:34.487 --> 37:36.289
How say you,
madam foreperson?

37:36.322 --> 37:38.725
"Commonwealth vs Ronald Vega

37:38.759 --> 37:40.827
on count one,
vehicular homicide,

37:40.861 --> 37:42.395
and count two,

37:42.428 --> 37:44.397
leaving the scene
of an accident --

37:44.430 --> 37:45.832
we, the jury,

37:45.866 --> 37:48.835
find the defendant,
Ronald Vega,

37:48.869 --> 37:50.837
not guilty."

37:50.871 --> 37:52.739
What do you know?

37:52.773 --> 37:54.908
Members of the jury,
we thank you.

37:54.941 --> 37:58.311
You're free to go,
as is the defendant.

37:58.344 --> 38:00.413
We are adjourned.

38:05.451 --> 38:06.753
This is a pattern with me.

38:06.787 --> 38:09.556
I get them off,
they never say thank you.

38:09.590 --> 38:12.793
Ms. Washington,
the court thanks you.

38:16.630 --> 38:19.600
You see that look
he just shot me?

38:19.633 --> 38:21.334
What was that?

38:21.367 --> 38:23.336
Well deserved.

38:23.369 --> 38:26.372
Come on.
I'll buy you dinner.

38:30.911 --> 38:33.980
Hey, Helen, I found
the spinach angel hair pasta.

38:34.014 --> 38:36.550
I got all the ingredients.

38:36.583 --> 38:38.552
Hello?

38:38.585 --> 38:40.020
Helen.

38:46.492 --> 38:49.462
Helen! Oh, Helen!

38:49.495 --> 38:51.998
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

38:52.032 --> 38:54.601
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

38:58.038 --> 38:59.506
Damn it.

39:06.179 --> 39:10.350
Something wrong, Elleanor?

39:12.052 --> 39:14.988
I changed my mind
about dinner,

39:15.021 --> 39:18.759
but I think Helen's
too dead tired to cook.

39:18.792 --> 39:21.662
You?

39:21.695 --> 39:24.097
Susan Robin?

39:24.130 --> 39:25.599
Lindsay?

39:25.632 --> 39:27.568
You told me you had
to work late that night,

39:27.601 --> 39:29.836
remember, Elleanor?

39:29.870 --> 39:31.805
I had theater tickets.

39:31.838 --> 39:32.839
You said you'd be
in the office

39:32.873 --> 39:34.007
till at least 9:00.

39:34.040 --> 39:37.143
But when I went there,
I found Lindsay.

39:37.177 --> 39:41.114
Why did you hurt her
or Helen?

39:41.147 --> 39:42.849
Helen's not dead.

39:42.883 --> 39:45.586
She just inhaled
a little chloroform.

39:45.619 --> 39:47.053
She's alive?

39:47.087 --> 39:50.791
Sometimes I like
to simulate death.

39:50.824 --> 39:53.894
When she wakes,
she'll find you.

39:57.731 --> 39:59.966
You came to kill me?

40:00.000 --> 40:02.903
You know how many times
you've killed me?

40:05.739 --> 40:09.610
Think you can reach
that gun?

40:09.643 --> 40:13.580
Think you can use that gun
to kill me, Elleanor?

40:15.181 --> 40:18.752
Let me make it easier
for you.

40:23.690 --> 40:26.893
I would love
to go out that way,

40:26.927 --> 40:30.196
with you
pulling the trigger.

40:30.230 --> 40:33.700
Go ahead, Elleanor,
get your gun.

40:37.237 --> 40:40.206
Go ahead. Shoot me.

40:40.240 --> 40:42.809
You'd be doing me a favor,
wouldn't you?

40:42.843 --> 40:44.811
Putting me out
of my miserable,

40:44.845 --> 40:46.112
pathetic existence.

40:46.146 --> 40:48.815
What you don't know
about me

40:48.849 --> 40:50.216
is that I would.

40:50.250 --> 40:51.918
I will shoot you.

40:51.952 --> 40:53.219
Then do it.

40:53.253 --> 40:56.690
I'll make you do it.

40:56.723 --> 40:59.225
I'm going to kill you
unless you kill me.

40:59.259 --> 41:00.561
-George --
-Do it!

41:00.594 --> 41:02.162
Don't come any closer.

41:02.195 --> 41:03.697
Shoot me, Elleanor!

41:03.730 --> 41:04.831
Don't make me
pull the trigger.

41:04.865 --> 41:05.966
Don't make me do it.

41:05.999 --> 41:07.233
You're going to have to
do it, Elleanor.

41:07.267 --> 41:09.970
You're going to have to
be the executioner.

41:10.003 --> 41:11.705
George,
put the knife down,

41:11.738 --> 41:13.106
and we're going
to talk about it.

41:13.139 --> 41:14.708
Just put it down.

41:17.744 --> 41:20.146
You did it.

41:20.180 --> 41:21.748
You did it.

41:26.653 --> 41:28.722
Helen!

41:28.755 --> 41:31.525
Helen, wake up!

41:31.558 --> 41:34.060
Wake up! Wake up!

41:34.094 --> 41:36.262
Helen, wake up!
Can you hear me?

41:36.296 --> 41:38.264
It's Elleanor.
Open your eyes.

41:38.298 --> 41:39.900
Helen, wake up!

41:39.933 --> 41:41.802
Open your eyes.
That's a good girl.

41:41.835 --> 41:43.069
That's a good girl

41:43.103 --> 41:45.005
open them up. Good girl.

41:45.038 --> 41:47.541
That's a good girl.
Good girl.

41:47.574 --> 41:49.610
Hey, hey, it's me.

41:49.643 --> 41:52.546
Helen, Helen...

41:52.579 --> 41:55.782
Open your eyes!

42:03.323 --> 42:06.026
I'm feeling better.

42:07.928 --> 42:09.863
I could even dance.

42:12.799 --> 42:15.902
What's the matter, Elleanor,

42:15.936 --> 42:19.005
not as dead
as you'd hoped for?

42:19.039 --> 42:22.643
I told you I loved
to simulate it.

42:22.676 --> 42:25.812
I put blanks
in your little gun earlier.

42:28.048 --> 42:29.650
You didn't really think

42:29.683 --> 42:33.954
I wanted to be killed
by you, did you?

42:33.987 --> 42:37.023
Though I did want to see
if you'd do it.

42:37.057 --> 42:38.692
George, please,

42:38.725 --> 42:40.661
if you're psychotic
or whatever,

42:40.694 --> 42:43.296
you obviously need help,
and I can help you.

42:43.329 --> 42:45.599
You just shot me.

42:45.632 --> 42:48.201
Now you want to help me?

42:48.234 --> 42:50.203
You have
an insanity defense

42:50.236 --> 42:52.038
for everything you've done.

42:52.072 --> 42:55.041
Well, then,
I'll also have one

42:55.075 --> 42:57.878
for what I'm about to do.

42:57.911 --> 42:58.945
Please.

42:58.979 --> 43:00.781
Bad boyfriend.

43:00.814 --> 43:01.948
Aah!

43:39.319 --> 43:42.322
â™ª

44:05.879 --> 44:06.880
WOMAN: You stinker!
