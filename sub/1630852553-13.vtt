Basically designed
my dad's suit.

I have things I wanna
tell you, but I can't.

00:08.443 --> 00:10.097
Then you should take this.

00:10.140 --> 00:11.620
Are you--are you
breaking up with me?

00:11.663 --> 00:12.925
It's open mic night.

00:12.969 --> 00:13.883

You're Superman.

00:22.457 --> 00:24.850

00:24.894 --> 00:26.200

00:32.336 --> 00:34.121
That mean
she's sort of God now?

00:34.164 --> 00:36.036
<i>That pendant gave her</i> <i>
a lot of power.</i>

00:36.079 --> 00:37.907
The rest of the world

00:37.950 --> 00:40.649
<i>Either merge or die.</i>

00:41.911 --> 00:42.694
No!

00:47.525 --> 00:49.440
- It's over.
- We haven't lost.

But without the pendant?

00:50.659 --> 00:52.530
There are other ways.

00:55.403 --> 00:58.580
My life has been
far from perfect.

00:58.623 --> 01:00.799
My parents died
when I was young.

01:00.843 --> 01:04.151
I've had trouble
holding on to work.

01:04.194 --> 01:06.414
Don't even get me started
about my love life.

01:08.285 --> 01:12.550
But that's the curse
of being born incomplete.

01:12.594 --> 01:15.118
You can be successful
and in love

01:15.162 --> 01:17.468

there's something

01:17.512 --> 01:19.427
missing from your life.

01:19.470 --> 01:21.864
That's why I wrote this book.

01:21.907 --> 01:24.954
To give people hope.

01:24.997 --> 01:28.000
Because that void
can be filled.

01:28.044 --> 01:31.917
Hi.
Who should I make it out to?

01:31.961 --> 01:34.442
Lucy. Lucy Lane.

01:34.485 --> 01:36.226
Nice alliteration.

01:36.270 --> 01:37.575
It's kinda my dad's thing.

01:37.619 --> 01:39.142
My sister and I are LLs.

01:41.927 --> 01:44.365
You're not
Lois Lane's sister, are you?

01:44.408 --> 01:47.803
That's me.
Lois Lane's sister.

01:47.846 --> 01:50.066
Not easy growing up
in that shadow, I take it.

01:50.110 --> 01:54.070

shadows that big.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.332

01:55.376 --> 01:56.942
My dad is just like Lois.

01:56.986 --> 01:58.988
He's a force of nature.

01:59.031 --> 02:01.208
Four-star general.

What about your mother?

02:03.775 --> 02:05.429
She left when I was kid.

Must've been painful.

did you decide

02:17.789 --> 02:19.313
that you weren't special?

02:19.356 --> 02:21.271
Just because we live
a divided existence

02:21.315 --> 02:23.665
does not mean that each of us
is not an essential piece

02:23.708 --> 02:25.841

Why do you keep treating me
like a child?

Because you are 15 years old.

10:14.004 --> 10:16.485
I've been helping you

clone tried to murder us.

Superman destroyed the pendant.

12:12.383 --> 12:14.124
She's become
some kind of a parasite.

12:14.168 --> 12:16.648
- Oh, please, Lois.
- What are you talking about?

12:16.692 --> 12:19.390
She drains people's energy

12:19.434 --> 12:21.175
- Enough.
