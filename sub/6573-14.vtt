WEBVTT

00:09.224 --> 00:11.352
It was Tres de Cinco,

00:11.393 --> 00:14.855
or the day before Cinco de Cuatro,

00:14.756 --> 00:19.136
and Buster Bluth had finally
found a family he fit in with.

00:19.178 --> 00:21.263
Where's Mother? Ah.

00:21.305 --> 00:24.642
Ah, way to go, way to go.

00:25.387 --> 00:27.265
Hi. I know you've been down today,

00:27.307 --> 00:29.142
so I brought you this.

00:29.184 --> 00:30.768
They're for Cinco.

00:30.810 --> 00:32.228
In case you wanted to make confetti

00:32.270 --> 00:33.729
out of something other than the pictures

00:33.771 --> 00:35.857
that they sell of the
chubby Linda Ronstadt.

00:35.898 --> 00:38.193
I am so blessed to have you in my life.

00:38.234 --> 00:41.112
I'm so blessed to have you in my life.

00:41.154 --> 00:44.949
Just six weeks ago, I was a hot mess.

00:44.991 --> 00:46.534
I was desperate for a mother,

00:46.575 --> 00:48.286
and I don't think I could admit it.

00:48.328 --> 00:51.039
As you'll see, he admits it plenty.

00:51.080 --> 00:52.832
But now look at me.

00:52.874 --> 00:55.960
I'm with a beautiful, elegant woman!

00:59.214 --> 01:02.800
And I think we should
take it to the next level.

01:04.760 --> 01:08.681
Buster had come a long way
since his fear of boats... 

01:11.012 --> 01:12.889
- ... was conquered... 
- Baby.

01:12.931 --> 01:16.017
And then rekindled, only to find himself

01:16.059 --> 01:18.061
- facing a bigger fear.
- Oh, come on!

01:18.103 --> 01:20.897
But his biggest fear wasn't confronting

01:20.939 --> 01:24.317
a wet, loose seal; it was losing one.

01:24.358 --> 01:25.693
Wait! She doesn't have her makeup!

01:25.735 --> 01:27.278
I have her lipstick!

01:27.320 --> 01:29.322
Mother!

01:29.363 --> 01:30.991
- Michael.
- Yeah, it's a tough one

01:31.032 --> 01:33.409
because there's about 400
witnesses that are ready

01:33.451 --> 01:34.995
to throw her underneath the boat.

01:35.036 --> 01:36.997
I don't think I can even help.

01:38.372 --> 01:40.207
Buster was distraught,

01:40.249 --> 01:43.086
- and made some foolish mistakes.
- Hey, Lupe.

01:43.128 --> 01:44.462
- Oh, Buster.
- Like this.

01:44.504 --> 01:45.755
Are you going to be all right?

01:45.797 --> 01:47.090
- Oh.
- Uh, you want me to stay?

01:47.132 --> 01:48.800
I was planning to visit with my family.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.093
Oh, no, and just watch.

01:50.135 --> 01:51.427
Mother is going to come

01:51.469 --> 01:53.387
waltzing through that door any day now,

01:53.429 --> 01:54.889
and she is going to be screaming,

01:54.931 --> 01:57.892
"Make sure you frisk that girl before... "

01:58.893 --> 02:00.353
I'll be fine.

02:02.396 --> 02:03.773
- That's my perfume.
- Mm, good.

02:03.815 --> 02:05.900
Okay, good. She wouldn't wear that.

02:05.942 --> 02:07.986
When his father didn't return, either,

02:08.027 --> 02:09.696
Buster stuck to his daily routine.

02:09.737 --> 02:11.614
Ah.

02:11.656 --> 02:12.740
You're welcome.

02:12.782 --> 02:14.200
Laying out Mother's clothes... 

02:14.241 --> 02:15.869
All right.

02:15.910 --> 02:17.954
♪ The vodka goes in, you
pour it in the other ♪

02:17.996 --> 02:19.539
Making Mother's breakfast... 

02:19.580 --> 02:23.209
♪ The olive on top and
then you call your... ♪

02:25.086 --> 02:26.796
♪ Mother. ♪

02:26.838 --> 02:30.216
Oh, this is bugging me.

02:32.719 --> 02:34.679
And amusing himself with little jokes... 

02:34.721 --> 02:36.014
Ah, finito.

02:36.056 --> 02:37.515
He thought she'd appreciate.

02:37.557 --> 02:38.933
Except for the hair.

02:38.975 --> 02:41.019
You have reduced.

02:41.061 --> 02:42.854
Well, you're not that skinny.

02:43.771 --> 02:45.565
Welcome home, chubs.

02:46.858 --> 02:48.317
Oh, you will kill me for that.

02:48.359 --> 02:50.570
And I don't want that blood on my hands.

02:52.072 --> 02:54.490
And with his mother gone, it was nice

02:54.532 --> 02:56.659
to get a chance to use the sewing machine.

02:58.369 --> 03:01.455
Still, he found ways to
feel good about himself.

03:01.497 --> 03:03.666
Buster, you always come through.

03:03.708 --> 03:05.668
Oh, Mother, that's so nice.

03:05.710 --> 03:08.880
No, no, no, no, no, I
mean it. It's amazing work.

03:08.922 --> 03:11.465
- But he knew it wasn't real.
- Okay, I need to stop,

03:11.507 --> 03:12.884
or I'm going to be committed.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.385
At first.

03:14.427 --> 03:15.929
What?

03:17.013 --> 03:19.099
But that would take hours.

03:19.140 --> 03:21.559
Oh, this is going to be just stunning.

03:21.601 --> 03:25.105
You are always so right.

03:25.146 --> 03:26.522
And then the waiter came back,

03:26.564 --> 03:28.649
and he said, "Oh, I'm sorry. Who are you?"

03:28.691 --> 03:30.651
And I said, "I'm Buster Bluth.

03:30.693 --> 03:33.113
That's the fourth time I've told you."

03:33.154 --> 03:36.116
Soon, he had run out of food... 

03:36.157 --> 03:38.201
that he knew how to make.

03:38.243 --> 03:40.245
But everywhere he looked, he found

03:40.286 --> 03:41.913
mocking reminders of the woman he lost.

03:45.166 --> 03:47.001
He did find some supplies

03:47.043 --> 03:50.463
from one of his mother's "I
can quit any time" stints.

03:50.504 --> 03:52.048
Oh, cute.

03:52.090 --> 03:55.176
But the emotional lift was temporary.

03:55.218 --> 03:58.345
And before long, things had gotten weird.

03:58.387 --> 04:01.808
♪ Put the olive on top and
you set it down for Mother. ♪

04:01.849 --> 04:04.269
To an uninformed observer,
it looked a little

04:04.310 --> 04:05.979
like that Vince Vaughn movie Psycho.

04:06.020 --> 04:07.688
Oh, I agree.

04:07.730 --> 04:11.358
Dancing with the Stars has
gone completely downhill.

04:11.400 --> 04:15.404
This pasta's way overcooked, Buster!

04:15.446 --> 04:18.531
Well, you didn't leave me
the simplest recipe, Mother.

04:18.574 --> 04:22.411
Finally, Lucille was
released under house arrest,

04:22.453 --> 04:25.748
and everything returned to normal.

04:25.790 --> 04:27.250
Oh.

04:27.292 --> 04:29.961
I was just thinking about you.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.671
Now the story of a family

04:31.712 --> 04:33.047
whose future was abruptly cancelled

04:33.089 --> 04:35.382
and the one son who had no choice

04:35.424 --> 04:37.635
but to keep himself together.

04:41.931 --> 04:44.851
It's Buster's... 

04:47.645 --> 04:50.356
Buster was passing time with Lucille... 

04:50.397 --> 04:51.899
Chinchilla!

04:51.941 --> 04:54.443
By playing games like Guess the Fur.

04:54.485 --> 04:56.487
The one you got after Dad had the affair

04:56.529 --> 04:58.156
with the chubby intern from Riverside.

04:58.198 --> 04:59.573
You win again, Buster.

04:59.615 --> 05:01.367
I know what's going to stump you.

05:01.408 --> 05:02.785
Oh!

05:02.827 --> 05:05.579
Close your eyes tight and plug your ears.

05:05.621 --> 05:09.583
Just plug one ear and press
the other one to the couch.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.586
But after three months of being

05:12.628 --> 05:14.255
cooped up with her youngest son... 

05:14.297 --> 05:15.756
Mother! Stop! Mother!

05:15.798 --> 05:17.050
Lucille was growing restive.

05:17.091 --> 05:19.260
No, Mother! If the alarm goes off

05:19.302 --> 05:21.637
and they catch you, they'll
take you away forever!

05:21.679 --> 05:24.682
I can't take it anymore.
I have to get out of here.

05:24.724 --> 05:26.809
I don't care. I can't keep playing

05:26.851 --> 05:28.811
Guess My Fur six times a day.

05:28.853 --> 05:30.980
I need a smoke.

05:32.439 --> 05:35.276
Right to the smokes, huh?

05:35.318 --> 05:37.737
Give me a minute. Let me catch my breath.

05:37.778 --> 05:39.613
And Buster refined a testimony

05:39.655 --> 05:42.200
that was meant to spare Lucille from jail

05:42.242 --> 05:43.951
at a legal defense strategy meeting

05:43.993 --> 05:45.328
- slash graduation party.
- It's gonna be an eel!

05:45.370 --> 05:46.746
Congratulations, Mother.

05:46.787 --> 05:48.622
You've managed to combine people's fear

05:48.664 --> 05:50.708
of homosexuals and eels into one alibi.

05:50.750 --> 05:53.418
And he'll be wearing his Army uniform

05:53.460 --> 05:55.462
so I can pretend I'm proud of him again.

05:55.504 --> 05:57.506
I couldn't find my Army uniform.

05:57.548 --> 05:59.633
Oh, but I thought the jury might like it

05:59.675 --> 06:01.344
if I show up as John-John Kennedy.

06:01.386 --> 06:04.264
Oh, yeah, that went over great last time.

06:05.932 --> 06:07.432
And it was offensive.

06:07.474 --> 06:09.518
Half your testicle was
hanging out of that thing.

06:09.560 --> 06:10.895
Good!

06:10.937 --> 06:13.147
I'm glad they saw it.

06:13.189 --> 06:16.025
It was like a Motherboy Ball, right?

06:16.067 --> 06:17.277
Hmm?

06:17.318 --> 06:18.736
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:18.778 --> 06:21.822
Put on your new uniform... with long pants.

06:21.864 --> 06:24.992
And keep your ball joke to
yourself, Andrew Dice Clay.

06:25.034 --> 06:26.911
So you can see why I need

06:26.953 --> 06:28.621
the testimony of someone
who's not a hot mess.

06:28.662 --> 06:30.455
- You're a hot mess!
- You're a hot mess!

06:30.497 --> 06:32.583
Let me get this
straight... you won't let me

06:32.625 --> 06:34.168
help with your case... 

06:34.210 --> 06:36.003
And the night before the trial,

06:36.045 --> 06:38.714
tensions had only gotten worse.

06:38.756 --> 06:41.508
You need me just as much
as I need you, cookie.

06:41.550 --> 06:43.303
Oh, really?

06:43.344 --> 06:45.430
Because you can be replaced, you know.

06:45.470 --> 06:47.014
Can she?

06:47.056 --> 06:51.352
And even if you can't,
you're not the boss of me.

06:52.603 --> 06:54.897
Can I go to... ? I'm going to the park!

06:55.982 --> 06:57.566
Oh, Buster.

06:57.608 --> 06:59.652
Hello.

06:59.693 --> 07:01.486
Hello to you, too, 2.

07:01.528 --> 07:03.656
Oh, look at all this produce.

07:03.697 --> 07:05.866
I'm juicing now. Would you like to join me?

07:05.908 --> 07:08.286
00 in the afternoon.

07:08.328 --> 07:09.829
00 a.m. somewhere.

07:09.870 --> 07:11.289
Oh, I forgot... 

07:11.331 --> 07:12.706
your mother wouldn't allow it.

07:12.748 --> 07:15.751
I don't care what she wants.

07:15.793 --> 07:18.379
Don't care what she wants.

07:18.421 --> 07:21.132
I don't do everything she tells me.

07:21.174 --> 07:23.717
Let's get juiced.

07:26.512 --> 07:28.348
The next morning, Buster awoke

07:28.389 --> 07:29.849
- with a vicious juice hangover.
- Oh.

07:31.309 --> 07:32.977
Well, that was a freebie.

07:34.437 --> 07:35.938
Mother's trial.

07:39.150 --> 07:40.526
Key witness!

07:40.567 --> 07:42.236
Key witness coming through.

07:42.278 --> 07:43.779
I'm a key... I... 

07:43.821 --> 07:45.572
I was making two ban... 

07:47.158 --> 07:50.328
Late last night, it was drizzling rain!

07:50.370 --> 07:52.288
I'm a key witness.

07:54.790 --> 07:56.125
Is it over?

07:56.167 --> 07:58.294
No, no, the grab-a-crab fest just started.

07:58.336 --> 07:59.670
Grab-a-crab?

07:59.712 --> 08:02.256
Oh, ma'am, um... is... is there a verdict

08:02.298 --> 08:04.091
in the "my mother stole
theQueen Mary"thing?

08:04.133 --> 08:05.718
It's all up on the dailies board.

08:05.759 --> 08:08.221
Dailies? What? Clam ch... 

08:08.262 --> 08:10.639
The fish is frozen here!

08:10.681 --> 08:14.560
It's frozen! Do you really want
to spend $30 on frozen fish?

08:14.601 --> 08:15.978
Buster.

08:16.020 --> 08:18.523
Where were you? This is all your fault.

08:18.564 --> 08:19.815
No, I was making... was making a ban... 

08:19.857 --> 08:21.275
- I was making two ban... 
- Save it.

08:21.317 --> 08:23.069
I can smell the cran-apple
on you from here.

08:23.110 --> 08:25.071
When... when are you coming home?

08:25.112 --> 08:26.697
I'm serving three to five.

08:26.739 --> 08:28.574
Like the saltless pie?

08:28.615 --> 08:31.536
I hope your juicy blender
bender was worth it.

08:31.577 --> 08:34.205
Don't come to visit me
because I won't see you.

08:34.246 --> 08:35.998
Oh, and good luck with your night terrors.

08:36.039 --> 08:38.876
Now no one will be there
to hear your screams.

08:40.419 --> 08:43.256
Won't miss it!

08:44.507 --> 08:46.717
Where... where do I go?

08:46.759 --> 08:48.135
What do I do?

08:48.177 --> 08:50.596
Where... where'd you get the pirate hat?

08:50.637 --> 08:52.390
Where... where do I go?

08:52.432 --> 08:54.434
And so Buster went back to the penthouse,

08:54.475 --> 08:57.437
feeling guilty and alone.

08:57.478 --> 09:00.106
And he couldn't bear to
relive the time he was there

09:00.147 --> 09:01.566
without Lucille before.

09:01.607 --> 09:04.318
I can't go through
another two days like that.

09:04.360 --> 09:06.320
And that's how Buster
decided to make another go

09:06.362 --> 09:08.822
at making another go at Lucille 2.

09:08.864 --> 09:10.241
Buster.

09:10.283 --> 09:11.700
My mother's gone away,

09:11.742 --> 09:13.536
and I thought, you've always been like a... 

09:13.578 --> 09:15.580
- Girlfriend.
- Not what I was gonna say.

09:15.621 --> 09:17.915
Anyways, I was over there,
and my friend's over here,

09:17.957 --> 09:20.167
and I thought, maybe I should just move in,

09:20.209 --> 09:22.878
because I love to hear
all about your medications

09:22.920 --> 09:24.422
and ailments and whatnot.

09:24.464 --> 09:26.466
Is that baby toe of yours still crawling

09:26.507 --> 09:28.342
over the others like a weird weed?

09:28.384 --> 09:30.595
Oh, Buster, how sweet of you to remember.

09:30.636 --> 09:32.054
Oh, it's one of my night terrors.

09:32.096 --> 09:33.431
But listen, Buster,

09:33.473 --> 09:36.142
- before I invite you into my arms... 
- Mm-hmm.

09:36.183 --> 09:39.186
My bedroom, my bathtub with the railing... 

09:39.228 --> 09:42.106
- Mm-hmm.
- I have to ask you something.

09:42.148 --> 09:43.316
Mm-hmm.

09:43.357 --> 09:44.900
Are you sure you're ready for this?

09:46.527 --> 09:49.489
So, that pretend kid's bedroom,
is that not an option... ?

09:49.530 --> 09:51.907
No, that room is all storage now, honey.

09:51.949 --> 09:53.826
So, yes or no?

09:53.867 --> 09:56.454
Are you ready to let go of your mother?

09:56.496 --> 09:57.871
Buster thought he was,

09:57.913 --> 10:00.458
although there was one ominous sign.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.835
I am ready for that, Lucille.

10:04.962 --> 10:06.380
Did you hear it?

10:09.258 --> 10:12.219
Wait. Did you just drop
the 2 after my name?

10:12.261 --> 10:14.263
Oh, I hope not.

10:14.305 --> 10:16.807
That would be creepy.

10:16.849 --> 10:18.809
Before you accidentally skip back too far

10:18.851 --> 10:21.604
and wind up in the middle
of the Maeby episode,

10:21.646 --> 10:24.148
trust me, no "2" was spoken.

10:25.691 --> 10:27.401
Every day, Buster visited the prison

10:27.443 --> 10:29.945
where his mother was incarcerated.

10:29.987 --> 10:32.323
Buster Bluth and pie for his m... 

10:32.365 --> 10:34.325
Lucille Bluth.

10:35.742 --> 10:36.910
Hmm... 

10:38.204 --> 10:40.498
And every day, she refused to see him.

10:40.540 --> 10:41.748
No.

10:41.790 --> 10:43.000
Oh.

10:43.042 --> 10:44.293
She doesn't want to see you.

10:44.335 --> 10:46.420
Excellent.

10:50.508 --> 10:52.385
He even pretended to be

10:52.426 --> 10:55.596
an old college flame of
Lucille's to gain admittance.

10:55.638 --> 10:57.806
Hello.

11:00.893 --> 11:02.520
Alex Trebek?

11:02.562 --> 11:04.938
She then rephrased it in
the form of a question.

11:04.980 --> 11:06.899
Who is Alex Trebek?

11:06.940 --> 11:08.775
Buster.

11:11.696 --> 11:14.240
- No, Buster.
- Mm-hmm.

11:15.908 --> 11:20.204
Do you have a pie or a
small sponge cake available?

11:21.455 --> 11:23.290
- Ah. Thank you.
- Here you go.

11:23.332 --> 11:25.668
And while his days were spent trying to get

11:25.710 --> 11:27.461
- his mother to love him... 
- Oh, Buster!

11:27.503 --> 11:29.338
- You're just in time.
- ... his nights were consumed

11:29.380 --> 11:30.881
with getting his lover to mother him.

11:30.923 --> 11:33.593
I hope you are in the
mood for a hot tomato.

11:33.634 --> 11:35.094
Mmm. Soup?

11:35.135 --> 11:37.221
With little grilled cheese
sandwiches on the side.

11:37.263 --> 11:39.599
Buster, that was innuendo.

11:39.640 --> 11:41.100
- Oh.
- My Lord, it's like

11:41.141 --> 11:42.976
we're speaking different languages here.

11:43.018 --> 11:44.395
No, it's not.

11:44.437 --> 11:45.730
It is working.

11:45.770 --> 11:47.856
I'm getting hungry.

11:48.815 --> 11:50.025
For love?

11:50.067 --> 11:51.485
Oh, God, is this another

11:51.527 --> 11:54.238
one of those nights where
nothing is as it seems

11:54.280 --> 11:56.490
and there's no cream pie for dessert?

11:56.532 --> 11:58.534
Holy Toledo, Buster, sometimes I think

11:58.576 --> 12:01.287
I'm nothing but a Horn & Hardart to you.

12:01.328 --> 12:03.080
Oh! What happened to innuendo?

12:03.122 --> 12:04.831
Let's do it quick.

12:04.873 --> 12:06.959
It's an old restaurant.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.753
Oh! A restaurant!

12:08.793 --> 12:10.212
I don't care if it's old!

12:10.254 --> 12:11.505
Look who I'm dating!

12:11.547 --> 12:13.299
Let's go there. Let's go there now.

12:13.340 --> 12:17.511
Buster, you can either
be a son or a lover... 

12:17.553 --> 12:20.180
and right now, you're
no good to me as a lover.

12:20.222 --> 12:22.391
Maybe you're right.

12:22.433 --> 12:25.936
Maybe this has been wrong from the start.

12:25.978 --> 12:28.147
- So... Mom.
- Out.

12:28.188 --> 12:29.774
And since he couldn't bear

12:29.814 --> 12:31.233
- to go back to the penthouse... 
- Out!

12:31.275 --> 12:32.485
You know, if tomorrow, you don't open up

12:32.526 --> 12:33.902
and let someone else in... 

12:33.944 --> 12:35.488
Buster needed to raise some money.

12:35.529 --> 12:37.615
Then the treasures you have inside... 

12:37.657 --> 12:39.575
This is my Motherboy Four medal.

12:39.617 --> 12:41.994
That's when I was a kangaroo in her pouch.

12:42.035 --> 12:43.996
What'll you give me for it?

12:44.037 --> 12:48.501
But Buster wasn't the first
Motherboy to hit hard times.

12:48.542 --> 12:50.503
What will you give me for these?

12:50.544 --> 12:52.087
All-time low.

12:52.129 --> 12:54.381
And that's when Buster found inspiration.

12:54.423 --> 12:57.343
She certainly looks proud of her son.

12:59.720 --> 13:02.222
I'm back!

13:02.264 --> 13:05.267
As it turned out, Buster
returned on the very day

13:05.309 --> 13:08.729
the Army policy regarding
sexual orientation had changed.

13:08.771 --> 13:10.855
- Are you gay?
- No.

13:10.897 --> 13:12.024
- You can tell me.
- I'm not.

13:12.065 --> 13:13.192
It's okay.

13:13.233 --> 13:14.067
Drew, tell him.

13:14.109 --> 13:15.778
- I'm gay.
- Oh.

13:15.820 --> 13:16.987
- Peter's gay.
- Oh... 

13:17.029 --> 13:18.071
- Sergeant Melnick's gay.
- Oh.

13:18.113 --> 13:19.198
Bi.

13:19.239 --> 13:20.991
Oh, sorry, he's bi.

13:21.033 --> 13:22.493
No, I'm going home for the day.

13:22.535 --> 13:23.868
I'm gay.

13:23.910 --> 13:25.329
Yeah, it really makes no difference to us.

13:25.371 --> 13:27.707
- We'll find something for you.
- Perfect.

13:27.748 --> 13:29.916
I was looking for something.

13:31.627 --> 13:32.961
You said "something," right?

13:33.003 --> 13:34.588
And that's how Buster officially

13:34.630 --> 13:36.716
reenlisted in the Army.

13:36.757 --> 13:39.176
And it's why, six months later,

13:39.218 --> 13:40.219
- Lucille Bluth.
- Lucille Bluth

13:40.260 --> 13:41.762
got some bad news.

13:41.804 --> 13:44.097
Yes?

13:44.139 --> 13:47.184
I'm here to see you about your son.

13:47.226 --> 13:48.477
Oh, this is a ploy.

13:48.519 --> 13:50.020
He's trying to get me to see him.

13:50.062 --> 13:51.938
How do I know you're really in the Army?

13:51.980 --> 13:54.650
Who did Larry Kert replace in Company?

13:54.692 --> 13:56.026
I don't know.

13:56.068 --> 13:57.820
I know who he thought he was replacing,

13:57.862 --> 13:59.739
and it was Dean Jones.

13:59.780 --> 14:01.156
But he didn't come close.

14:02.783 --> 14:04.577
My Buster?

14:04.618 --> 14:05.786
And Lucille rushed to the hospital.

14:05.828 --> 14:07.912
What happened? Where's my son?

14:07.954 --> 14:10.207
Mrs. Bluth, your son went
down while piloting a plane

14:10.249 --> 14:13.085
- over Afghanistan.
- Oh, my God... 

14:13.126 --> 14:15.671
He deserves a big hand for
that and we gave him one.

14:15.713 --> 14:18.591
I'm afraid, besides that,
there's nothing we can do.

14:23.262 --> 14:24.597
Hi, Mother.

14:25.723 --> 14:26.932
Well, you look fine.

14:26.973 --> 14:28.267
The doctor said you went down

14:28.308 --> 14:30.644
while piloting a plane over Afghanistan.

14:30.686 --> 14:32.855
Oh, yeah, that plane was in Afghanistan.

14:32.897 --> 14:34.981
It seems the Army had taken advantage

14:35.023 --> 14:37.735
of Buster's childlike interest in games.

14:37.777 --> 14:40.738
This is so much more
fun than "Guess the Fur."

14:40.780 --> 14:44.032
And his childlike inability to distinguish

14:44.074 --> 14:46.452
- between games and reality.
- Oh!

14:46.493 --> 14:49.705
So they set him up as a drone pilot here.

14:49.747 --> 14:52.332
Want to go to lunch, Private Bluth?

14:52.374 --> 14:55.669
Not till I take out the hospital!

14:55.711 --> 14:57.630
I tell you, this kid's amazing.

14:57.671 --> 15:01.216
If I had him back in the '60s,
Cuba would be the 51st state.

15:01.258 --> 15:04.428
You're not gonna get away
from me, little nurse! Aah!

15:04.470 --> 15:06.555
He had been playing for 47 straight hours.

15:06.597 --> 15:10.225
Take that, Taliban wedding!

15:10.267 --> 15:13.353
But like anyone who plays
video games for too long,

15:13.395 --> 15:14.939
he started to make mistakes.

15:14.980 --> 15:17.775
Hey, Bluth, you just took
out an art museum in Madrid.

15:17.817 --> 15:19.568
Oh, you can go to Spain in this thing?

15:19.610 --> 15:20.945
Maybe you should take a break.

15:20.986 --> 15:22.070
You could've hurt some innocent people.

15:22.112 --> 15:23.155
Innocent people?!

15:23.196 --> 15:24.865
You mean I've been

15:24.907 --> 15:26.492
hurting guilty people?!

15:26.533 --> 15:29.411
But Buster was a peaceful man.

15:29.453 --> 15:30.788
Oh, God!

15:30.830 --> 15:31.956
Pilot down!

15:31.997 --> 15:33.666
Medic!

15:33.707 --> 15:35.501
It was the kind of emergency

15:35.542 --> 15:36.919
that the drone pilot paramedics
had long been waiting for.

15:36.961 --> 15:38.295
I got a man down!

15:38.337 --> 15:39.839
Sorry we're late.

15:39.880 --> 15:41.548
Some kid swallowed an
eye at the Build-A-Bear.

15:41.590 --> 15:43.926
Why do they have us at a mini-mall?

15:43.968 --> 15:45.177
It was the first

15:45.218 --> 15:46.428
known injury to a drone pilot

15:46.470 --> 15:48.180
and the Army took it seriously.

15:48.221 --> 15:50.850
Apparently, no one told him
that they were real planes.

15:50.891 --> 15:52.267
If this guy comes after us,

15:52.309 --> 15:54.478
they could pull funding
for the whole program.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.772
So, how do we buy off ol' One Arm?

15:56.814 --> 15:59.107
First we gotta find something he needs.

15:59.149 --> 16:01.401
Well, we do have the bionics program.

16:01.443 --> 16:03.195
Ice cream.

16:03.236 --> 16:05.572
Maybe we shouldn't be discussing this here.

16:05.614 --> 16:07.867
Yeah, I think we're at those kids' table.

16:09.159 --> 16:10.661
So you fell out of a chair,

16:10.703 --> 16:12.913
and for this, the government
gives you applause?

16:12.955 --> 16:15.374
No... a big hand.

16:15.415 --> 16:18.878
I thought I recognized
that little son of a bitch.

16:18.919 --> 16:20.963
This is why you can't keep a job

16:21.005 --> 16:22.297
at one hospital!

16:22.339 --> 16:25.843
Why does it have to be so big?

16:25.885 --> 16:28.804
Well, they said the
miniaturization comes later.

16:28.846 --> 16:32.182
I mean, you remember how big
your first cell phone was.

16:32.224 --> 16:34.018
That was a phone.

16:34.059 --> 16:36.562
This looks like you're pointing
to a place that buys your gold.

16:36.603 --> 16:38.647
I haven't learned how to control it.

16:38.689 --> 16:40.232
They're gonna work with me.

16:40.273 --> 16:42.526
So you had me come out
here under false pretenses?

16:42.568 --> 16:44.945
You wouldn't come here any other way!

16:44.987 --> 16:46.572
You haven't seen me in a year.

16:46.613 --> 16:49.241
It's why I went to Army... to win you back.

16:49.282 --> 16:51.535
You have to forgive me!

16:51.577 --> 16:54.038
It's not about forgiving
you. Although I don't.

16:54.079 --> 16:55.998
You need to grow up, Buster,

16:56.040 --> 16:58.667
because I can't take care of you anymore.

16:58.709 --> 17:01.545
I need to "get away-get away."

17:01.587 --> 17:03.839
You're hopelessly hopeless, Buster.

17:03.881 --> 17:06.132
It's as if they wrote
that song for my own son.

17:06.174 --> 17:09.176
- Hm?
- I'm glad you have a new hand.

17:09.219 --> 17:11.387
But you need to find
someone else to hold it.

17:11.430 --> 17:14.016
Tell the prison limo to come around!

17:14.058 --> 17:17.227
Fine! I got my own family now... Army!

17:17.269 --> 17:18.771
And they want me!

17:18.811 --> 17:20.021
You guys want me, right?

17:20.064 --> 17:21.647
Oh, yeah. They're not gonna invest

17:21.690 --> 17:23.358
this kind of money without
wanting you for keeps.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.527
Oh, good. Once you learn how to use

17:25.569 --> 17:26.779
that thing, they're going to turn you

17:26.819 --> 17:27.738
into a killing monster.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.489
Monster... ?

17:29.531 --> 17:31.033
This doesn't make me look sexy.

17:31.075 --> 17:32.242
Throw it out.

17:32.284 --> 17:34.369
Well, that explains the photo shoot.

17:35.704 --> 17:37.915
And so Buster began a rehab program

17:37.957 --> 17:39.499
he was terrified to succeed at.

17:39.541 --> 17:41.085
Open the cabinet, please.

17:41.126 --> 17:45.547
Mm... mm... mm... mm!

17:45.589 --> 17:46.840
Oh... 

17:46.882 --> 17:48.258
Too hard.

17:48.300 --> 17:49.802
Uh, I think that was too hard.

17:49.843 --> 17:51.011
- Okay.
- Yeah.

17:51.053 --> 17:53.764
Let's just grab that toothpaste.

17:53.806 --> 17:55.223
Okay.

17:55.265 --> 17:57.059
- Use your new hand.
- Okay.

17:57.101 --> 17:58.769
Oh!

17:58.811 --> 18:00.353
I got some on you.

18:00.395 --> 18:02.522
Uh... yeah.

18:02.564 --> 18:05.317
- You did get some on me.
- Yeah.

18:05.358 --> 18:07.736
- Too hard?
- Buster seemed slow to master the challenges.

18:07.778 --> 18:10.196
Yeah, that's... that's on her.

18:10.238 --> 18:12.365
- He got a little... 
- It was too hard.

18:12.407 --> 18:13.951
I think it was, as well.

18:13.993 --> 18:16.870
Let's go ahead and fast-forward
through the commercials.

18:16.912 --> 18:18.371
Okay, that's too fa... okay, stop.

18:18.413 --> 18:19.873
Well, there's Jon Cryer.

18:19.915 --> 18:21.249
Stop! That's Jon Cryer!

18:22.501 --> 18:24.003
Well, look at that... 

18:24.044 --> 18:25.879
we're back at the
Progressive Insurance lady.

18:25.921 --> 18:28.340
I'm better off just
watching the commercials!

18:28.381 --> 18:29.883
Don't say that.

18:29.925 --> 18:31.969
But behind the two-way mirror,

18:32.011 --> 18:34.262
hope wasn't in abundance.

18:34.304 --> 18:36.974
Hope this guy likes the music
acts on Saturday Night Live

18:37.016 --> 18:39.267
because he's gonna be
watching a lot of them.

18:39.309 --> 18:41.687
- How many remotes do we have?
- That was the only one.

18:41.728 --> 18:43.772
There's seven monitors
here... we have one remote.

18:43.814 --> 18:45.357
Do we have anybody from Pinky Team?

18:45.398 --> 18:47.151
Guys, he can't do this!

18:47.192 --> 18:49.987
And around week five,
the Army finally realized

18:50.029 --> 18:52.739
that Buster was in no hurry to leave.

18:52.781 --> 18:54.825
Aah! I blew it again!

18:54.867 --> 18:56.242
I'll never do it right!

18:56.284 --> 18:58.704
I'm a monst... 

18:58.745 --> 19:00.372
Do you have any ice cream?

19:00.413 --> 19:02.541
Maybe it would work with ice cream.

19:02.582 --> 19:04.292
And now he wants ice cream.

19:04.334 --> 19:06.378
He's using us.

19:06.419 --> 19:08.714
Yeah, it might be time for the Q-test.

19:08.755 --> 19:10.507
The Q-test?

19:14.094 --> 19:15.804
Oh... 

19:15.846 --> 19:17.764
I'm sorry, we're running behind
with your testing, Buster.

19:17.806 --> 19:19.516
We'll just be a few more minutes.

19:19.558 --> 19:21.143
Okay.

19:21.185 --> 19:22.978
Oh... well... !

19:23.020 --> 19:25.022
And it was then that Gunner learned why

19:25.064 --> 19:26.899
- it was called the Q-test.
- Oh.

19:26.940 --> 19:29.776
Aren't you the "cu-test"?

19:29.818 --> 19:33.947
Now, he can't see us at
all... that's correct?

19:33.989 --> 19:35.908
I know!

19:35.949 --> 19:37.617
Why wouldn't he be able to see us?

19:37.659 --> 19:40.120
- You looking around?
- Because it's a mirror.

19:40.162 --> 19:42.414
No, it's a window.

19:42.455 --> 19:44.332
Oh, hi.

19:44.374 --> 19:48.587
Okay, let's take it down.

19:48.628 --> 19:50.172
I know, I know... 

19:51.339 --> 19:53.092
Send in the authority figure.

19:53.133 --> 19:55.468
Hi.

19:57.345 --> 19:59.681
How are you managing
with that hand, solider?

20:01.000 --> 20:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

20:13.445 --> 20:16.073
Buster was being discharged from the Army.

20:16.115 --> 20:17.991
So, where am I supposed to go?

20:18.033 --> 20:19.492
What am I supposed to do?

20:19.534 --> 20:21.494
I... I have nowhere to live.

20:21.536 --> 20:24.289
You should've thought about that
before you let that cat live.

20:24.330 --> 20:26.291
- And that's when he met Ophelia Love... 
- Oh, I'm sorry.

20:26.332 --> 20:28.794
The devoted wife of the
candidate Herbert Love,

20:28.835 --> 20:30.587
- who was on a tour... 
- I have nowhere to go.

20:30.629 --> 20:32.464
- Of the Veterans' Hospital.
- Excuse me.

20:32.505 --> 20:34.174
You're a veteran and
you have nowhere to go?

20:34.216 --> 20:35.592
Oh, it's not Army's fault.

20:35.634 --> 20:37.385
I'm a monster.

20:37.427 --> 20:39.179
And what makes you think you're a monster?

20:39.221 --> 20:41.181
What do you see when you look at this?

20:41.223 --> 20:45.060
I see a veteran whose
hand I'd like to shake.

20:45.102 --> 20:47.062
Not that one.

20:47.104 --> 20:49.439
I think you should meet my husband.

20:49.481 --> 20:51.357
We may have something for you.

20:51.399 --> 20:53.860
Perfect! Wait, you didn't
say "nothing," did you?

20:53.902 --> 20:56.905
- Something.
- "Something." Got it.

20:56.947 --> 20:58.490
Look how big his hand is.

20:58.531 --> 21:00.159
But Herbert would be less enthusiastic.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.785
And you want him to live with us?

21:01.827 --> 21:03.954
Well, he's a vet, Herbert.

21:03.996 --> 21:06.081
And you yourself said you need something

21:06.123 --> 21:08.374
to compete with the woman
you're running against.

21:08.416 --> 21:12.129
Lucille 2 had recently adopted
a Hispanic boy named Perfecto.

21:12.171 --> 21:13.755
And since you're never around, I mean,

21:13.797 --> 21:15.257
he could help me with the boys.

21:15.299 --> 21:17.634
It's like that movie The Blind Side.

21:17.676 --> 21:21.763
I suppose we could use
a Blind Side Monster.

21:21.805 --> 21:24.266
Well, we shouldn't call him a monster.

21:24.308 --> 21:26.226
That's why I love you, Ophelia.

21:26.268 --> 21:31.190
You've got a heart as big as
that Blind Side Monster's hand.

21:32.899 --> 21:34.067
Oh!

21:34.109 --> 21:36.069
And so it was decided

21:36.111 --> 21:38.197
Buster was to stay with the Love family.

21:38.238 --> 21:41.241
He's fine. He's fine. He's fine.

21:41.283 --> 21:43.076
- Welcome to the family.
- Oh!

21:43.118 --> 21:45.162
He'd found a home at last.

21:45.204 --> 21:47.039
- Oh!
- Oh! Uh-uh, uh-uh!

21:49.833 --> 21:51.584
In the following weeks,
Buster came in handy

21:53.337 --> 21:55.797
Helping the boys at school... 

21:55.839 --> 21:59.259
This table is for National
Honor Society members only.

21:59.301 --> 22:00.468
Really.

22:00.510 --> 22:02.595
Well, what about these two guys?

22:02.637 --> 22:03.889
Were they invited?

22:03.930 --> 22:05.182
Light drizzle... 

22:05.224 --> 22:06.850
and thunder.

22:06.892 --> 22:10.020
- What?!
- See, light drizzle will just annoy you

22:10.062 --> 22:14.149
but, you see, thunder... will "F" you up!

22:14.191 --> 22:16.818
This got the attention of Perfecto Telles,

22:16.860 --> 22:20.572
vice president of the
student anti-bullying squad.

22:20.613 --> 22:23.242
Buster even received a
badge from an undercover cop

22:23.283 --> 22:24.701
that was posing as a teacher.

22:24.743 --> 22:27.453
You're never too old
to stand up to a bully.

22:27.495 --> 22:30.290
Whether he's an attention
hog who looks just like you,

22:30.332 --> 22:32.084
or whether he's half your size.

22:35.337 --> 22:38.006
He used his finely-honed
skills as a doting son

22:38.048 --> 22:39.383
to give the long-neglected Ophelia

22:39.423 --> 22:41.176
some much-deserved attention.

22:41.218 --> 22:42.761
Pour in the liquor... 

22:42.802 --> 22:44.388
Don't want the boys to see... 

22:44.428 --> 22:46.265
You throw in some cola... 

22:46.306 --> 22:48.474
Got a Coke and Hennessy!

22:49.976 --> 22:51.728
Just for you, Mother Love.

22:51.770 --> 22:53.313
- Buster... 
- Mm... 

22:53.355 --> 22:55.899
You are the most considerate
man I've ever met.

22:55.941 --> 22:58.944
Oh, stop! You're embarrassing me!

22:58.985 --> 23:00.653
And sweet and... 

23:00.695 --> 23:02.739
No, I'm serious... stop, stop.

23:02.781 --> 23:04.032
But your other hand is waving me on.

23:04.074 --> 23:05.700
Oh, is that going again?

23:05.742 --> 23:07.286
I think it's on demo.

23:07.327 --> 23:09.371
Do you have a pencil or a paper clip?

23:09.413 --> 23:11.790
And he helped Herbert
on the campaign trail.

23:11.831 --> 23:14.042
Let me show you what a
government handout looks like.

23:14.084 --> 23:15.459
Hold your government hand out.

23:15.501 --> 23:19.089
Yeah! And let's give
freedom from government

23:19.131 --> 23:20.924
a big thumbs-up!

23:20.966 --> 23:23.467
Although the hadn't
achieved complete mastery.

23:23.509 --> 23:25.720
- Come on, Buster, dance!
- I don't want to dance.

23:25.762 --> 23:27.639
Come on, dance, Buster!

23:27.680 --> 23:29.057
Buster was enjoying his new role

23:29.099 --> 23:31.601
as a symbol of government waste.

23:31.643 --> 23:33.477
It's like I said about contraception:

23:33.519 --> 23:35.521
If you want me to pay for her diaphragm,

23:35.563 --> 23:39.359
- I get to put my hand in her... 
- Shoe!

23:39.401 --> 23:41.987
Nice stop, Blind Side Monster.

23:42.028 --> 23:44.281
Buster... Blind Side Buster.

23:44.323 --> 23:46.866
And he was feeling more
confident every day.

23:46.908 --> 23:48.160
Mm!

23:48.201 --> 23:49.619
Okay... 

23:49.661 --> 23:52.080
Give him a big hand back!

23:53.832 --> 23:55.125
Arguably, too confident.

23:55.167 --> 23:58.128
Hey!

23:59.629 --> 24:00.630
Okay, hey, hey... Oh-ho!

24:00.672 --> 24:02.966
Hah! Hm!

24:03.008 --> 24:04.468
Although, after this appearance,

24:04.508 --> 24:07.762
he spent a lot less time with Herbert.

24:07.804 --> 24:10.974
And a lot more time with Ophelia.

24:11.016 --> 24:12.976
Which is what led to this.

24:16.480 --> 24:18.690
That's funny, no smoke came out.

24:18.731 --> 24:20.275
Smoke?

24:20.317 --> 24:21.485
Wait, what just happened?

24:21.525 --> 24:23.278
This.

24:25.864 --> 24:27.491
Okay, okay, okay.

24:27.531 --> 24:29.533
So you don't think that the next level

24:29.575 --> 24:31.535
is adult adoption, do you?

24:31.577 --> 24:33.997
Come on, Buster.

24:34.039 --> 24:36.540
You've been flirting with me since day one.

24:36.582 --> 24:37.541
What?

24:37.583 --> 24:39.002
Bringing me these flowers,

24:39.044 --> 24:41.587
offering to undress me.

24:41.629 --> 24:43.048
What about the singing?

24:43.089 --> 24:47.427
"Sealed with a kiss" through
the door while I bathed?

24:47.469 --> 24:48.970
Right.

24:49.012 --> 24:50.638
Mother stuff.

24:50.680 --> 24:53.725
I mean, you're married.

24:57.687 --> 24:59.147
What is this?

25:00.773 --> 25:04.319
That is my husband, with a prostitute.

25:04.361 --> 25:08.781
I've worn a captain's hat with
someone who had hair like that.

25:08.823 --> 25:10.867
But I... I can't... 

25:10.909 --> 25:13.953
I mean, you're like a mother to me.

25:13.995 --> 25:18.417
You can either be a son or a lover to me.

25:18.458 --> 25:21.044
And I already have two sons.

25:21.086 --> 25:23.505
And perhaps it was the fear
that she'd throw him out,

25:23.547 --> 25:25.006
or he finally did grow up,

25:25.048 --> 25:28.676
but that night, Buster acted like a man.

25:31.555 --> 25:33.681
After spending the night with Ophelia Love,

25:33.723 --> 25:35.267
Buster proudly went to visit his mother.

25:35.308 --> 25:36.684
I came here to thank you.

25:36.726 --> 25:41.481
You were trying to push
me out of the nest... 

25:41.523 --> 25:43.066
and you were right.

25:43.108 --> 25:44.443
- Really?
- Yes.

25:44.484 --> 25:45.735
I've grown.

25:45.777 --> 25:47.862
And I'm in love.

25:47.904 --> 25:49.573
Hamster or turtle?

25:49.613 --> 25:50.990
No, Mother.

25:51.032 --> 25:52.075
Hamsters are gross.

25:52.117 --> 25:53.410
It's a female.

25:53.452 --> 25:55.203
Human. Female human. Whole thing.

25:55.245 --> 25:58.164
So your parental
responsibilities are complete.

25:58.206 --> 25:59.249
Hot.

25:59.291 --> 26:02.461
I no longer need you.

26:02.502 --> 26:03.920
Well, you don't have to go that far.

26:03.962 --> 26:05.755
I'm not a mother boy anymore.

26:06.881 --> 26:09.593
I'm a mother man.

26:14.389 --> 26:15.932
Use your good hand.

26:17.934 --> 26:19.769
Guards!

26:21.313 --> 26:23.731
And on his way back to his new love,

26:23.773 --> 26:25.942
Buster ran into Michael,

26:25.984 --> 26:27.777
who was trying to get the life story rights

26:27.819 --> 26:30.489
from one of the few
remaining family members

26:30.530 --> 26:32.949
he hadn't thrown out of the movie.

26:32.991 --> 26:33.950
What about Mom?

26:33.992 --> 26:35.368
I have her, but I'm about to

26:35.410 --> 26:37.870
throw it in her face when I see her,

26:37.912 --> 26:39.414
and I can't go to my son.

26:39.456 --> 26:41.958
Well, I have nothing to be ashamed about.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.461
I'm in love.

26:44.503 --> 26:47.506
And do you want to hear
something so surprising?

26:47.547 --> 26:50.049
She started out as my mother figure.

26:50.091 --> 26:52.051
- Not surprising.
- And he returned back

26:52.093 --> 26:55.388
to his love nest to tell
Ophelia the good news.

26:55.430 --> 26:56.931
I'm out of the thing!

26:56.973 --> 26:58.350
How did yours go?

26:58.391 --> 27:00.477
It's over.

27:00.519 --> 27:02.103
I talked to Herbert, I told
him everything about us,

27:02.145 --> 27:03.104
and it's over.

27:03.146 --> 27:05.649
Mm. I know it's scary.

27:05.689 --> 27:08.360
I just got out of a long relationship, too.

27:08.401 --> 27:09.611
But I'm here for you.

27:09.653 --> 27:12.531
And, girl, I ain't going nowhere.

27:12.572 --> 27:14.240
I need you to leave.

27:14.282 --> 27:15.699
Mm, so let's get it o... !

27:15.741 --> 27:17.035
Wait, what's happening?

27:17.076 --> 27:18.786
He wants to try to change.

27:18.828 --> 27:21.540
He wants a second chance,
and I want to give it to him.

27:21.581 --> 27:23.749
What... 

27:23.791 --> 27:26.710
So you... you were just
using me to hurt him?

27:26.752 --> 27:29.047
Yes.

27:29.088 --> 27:30.298
Thank you.

27:30.340 --> 27:32.300
But what... what about me?

27:32.342 --> 27:34.219
What happens to me?

27:34.260 --> 27:37.556
I... I certainly can't go
back to you as my mother.

27:37.597 --> 27:40.392
After I've zipped down, you
can't expect me to zip up!

27:40.433 --> 27:41.601
I know that.

27:41.643 --> 27:43.102
But you have to leave.

27:43.144 --> 27:45.522
Oh, no, I'm okay with the mothering.

27:45.564 --> 27:47.315
I mean, he had you first, I'm here to stay.

27:47.357 --> 27:49.108
It's just a little
mother/son bump in the road.

27:49.150 --> 27:52.070
Mother, I ain't going nowhere.

27:52.111 --> 27:55.281
Your hand is broken again.

27:55.323 --> 27:58.826
No, it's just my heart.

27:58.868 --> 28:01.621
Oh, it's my hand, too, actually.

28:01.663 --> 28:02.706
I'm sorry, Buster.

28:02.746 --> 28:03.873
Buster was blindsided.

28:03.915 --> 28:05.791
Ophelia!

28:05.833 --> 28:07.419
Tell me this.

28:07.460 --> 28:08.878
Who is a better lover?

28:08.920 --> 28:10.422
- He is.
- He is. Okay.

28:11.464 --> 28:12.965
What about son?!

28:13.007 --> 28:15.885
Buster was hurt.

28:17.845 --> 28:20.223
And perhaps that's why he availed himself

28:20.265 --> 28:23.017
to the photos of Herbert
and the prostitute.

28:24.644 --> 28:26.688
And Buster, furious,

28:26.730 --> 28:30.609
decided to expose Herbert himself.

28:32.026 --> 28:34.320
But not before using the wrong hand

28:34.362 --> 28:36.114
to punch a picture of Herbert.

28:36.155 --> 28:37.616
Stupid Bust... !

28:39.867 --> 28:41.453
Unfortunately, it was the night of Cinco,

28:41.494 --> 28:44.581
and no one was home to find him.

28:44.623 --> 28:47.333
Sad. Sad.

28:52.756 --> 28:56.301
Buster came to and rushed
to Cinco to share the photos

28:56.342 --> 28:58.386
with Herbert Love's political enemy,

28:58.428 --> 29:02.390
when he ran into Tobias,
who enlisted Buster's help

29:02.432 --> 29:06.603
for a musical that was becoming
less fantastic every minute.

29:06.645 --> 29:08.896
But I've got to find Lucille 2,
I've got to give her pictures.

29:08.938 --> 29:11.190
- I don't know the songs.
- It's prerecorded.

29:11.232 --> 29:13.318
You're a monster, you
don't have to be any good.

29:13.359 --> 29:15.695
- What?
- Now just go Thing your heart out

29:15.737 --> 29:17.905
and don't be put off by
the freakishly large... 

29:17.947 --> 29:19.365
What... Oh, God!

29:19.407 --> 29:20.742
Okay, well, well, good.

29:20.784 --> 29:22.494
Then just the, uh, the one glove will do,

29:22.535 --> 29:24.870
and, uh... perfecto!

29:26.080 --> 29:27.624
As fate would have it,

29:27.666 --> 29:30.502
Perfecto Telles was also
in need of a monster.

29:30.543 --> 29:33.129
He's a bully. So I want
you to "bad cop" him

29:33.171 --> 29:34.172
for me a little, okay?

29:34.213 --> 29:35.507
Yeah, yeah.

29:35.548 --> 29:36.882
And that's when he heard his name.

29:36.924 --> 29:38.718
Perfecto!

29:38.760 --> 29:41.012
And he's a real bully.

29:41.053 --> 29:43.222
He's taking money from this
innocent young high school girl.

29:43.264 --> 29:44.641
Ugh, I don't think I can help you.

29:44.683 --> 29:46.476
Please. I don't want to be

29:46.518 --> 29:48.353
- a monster anymore.
- Can't you just

29:48.394 --> 29:51.230
show him a little thunder?
Just to scare him a bit?

29:51.272 --> 29:54.150
And that's when Buster saw
the woman he'd come for.

29:54.192 --> 29:55.694
I'm sorry.

29:55.735 --> 29:58.070
I have to take care of something.

29:59.572 --> 30:00.824
Lucille 2.

30:00.865 --> 30:03.201
- I've been looking for you.
- Buster!

30:03.242 --> 30:04.494
You look different;
something's happened to you.

30:04.536 --> 30:05.578
Yes.

30:05.620 --> 30:07.455
I've been with a black woman.

30:07.497 --> 30:08.914
I was talking about your hand.

30:08.956 --> 30:11.334
Oh. This huge thing? Yeah, it's new.

30:11.376 --> 30:13.378
Of course, the week after
I got it, the six came out.

30:13.419 --> 30:15.129
You can play a flute with that one.

30:15.171 --> 30:16.381
It comes with a flute!

30:16.422 --> 30:17.841
But I'm not here about that.

30:17.882 --> 30:19.759
I'm here about this.

30:19.801 --> 30:21.511
What is this?

30:21.553 --> 30:25.097
Oh, just pictures of Herbert
Love with a lady of the night.

30:25.139 --> 30:29.018
And he's gotten himself in some
pretty hot ham water this time.

30:29.060 --> 30:32.689
I want you to humiliate
him and win the election.

30:32.731 --> 30:34.524
That's my wig.

30:34.566 --> 30:36.984
Buster, this is priceless;
why are you giving it to me?

30:37.026 --> 30:38.486
Because I want to hurt him.

30:38.528 --> 30:40.864
I've never known you
to want to hurt anybody.

30:40.905 --> 30:43.742
Well, I hurt my mother, didn't I?

30:43.783 --> 30:45.993
I missed her trial, and
she cut me out of her life.

30:46.035 --> 30:47.620
- But I'm over that!
- Really?

30:47.662 --> 30:50.164
Then you have me to thank for that.

30:50.206 --> 30:52.500
- What do you mean?
- Oh, Buster,

30:52.542 --> 30:55.545
you think missing her
trial was an accident?

30:55.587 --> 30:57.505
Yes.

30:57.547 --> 30:59.131
Buster, I helped you with that.

30:59.173 --> 31:01.801
Although "helped" might not be

31:01.843 --> 31:03.386
the best description of what she did.

31:03.428 --> 31:05.513
In fact, she'd been laying in wait for him.

31:05.555 --> 31:07.807
Oh, Buster!

31:07.849 --> 31:09.934
Hello!

31:11.936 --> 31:14.773
And once she'd gotten
Buster into the apartment,

31:14.814 --> 31:16.900
she eschewed the all-natural
juice for the kind

31:16.941 --> 31:19.903
with cartoon animals
and riddles on the box.

31:21.613 --> 31:24.574
The type Buster had been
known to have a weakness for.

31:24.616 --> 31:26.451
Thank you.

31:26.492 --> 31:29.454
And soon, the partying was off the hook,

31:29.495 --> 31:31.748
with Buster drinking right out of the box.

31:31.790 --> 31:35.460
Oh, this is just like Mother's Day Eve!

31:36.961 --> 31:38.630
Although, at one point,

31:38.671 --> 31:41.006
he did have something close to an insight.

31:41.048 --> 31:43.050
I mean, how do you miss a sign like that?

31:43.092 --> 31:44.427
Oh.

31:47.096 --> 31:49.014
I was tinkling!

31:50.224 --> 31:51.476
You kept me from mother?

31:51.517 --> 31:53.853
You sent her to prison?

31:53.895 --> 31:55.396
And this whole time, I thought about

31:55.438 --> 31:56.606
getting back together with you.

31:56.648 --> 31:58.483
Well, you're a little late, honey.

31:58.524 --> 32:01.360
I've been dating your father
for the past couple of weeks.

32:06.908 --> 32:08.576
Buster was in a whirl.

32:10.787 --> 32:14.248
Confused and betrayed, he
wanted to punch something.

32:14.290 --> 32:15.917
Which is why he went here.

32:15.959 --> 32:18.085
Hey! I need to punch something!

32:18.127 --> 32:20.379
Even if it is a poor little donkey.

32:20.421 --> 32:22.548
But it wasn't that kind of donkey punch.

32:23.549 --> 32:25.551
Oh, I need some juice.

32:28.095 --> 32:31.516
Perhaps uno mas, señor,
to feed to the fishes?

32:32.308 --> 32:33.309
Gene Parmesan.

32:33.351 --> 32:35.311
This is not my real job.

32:35.353 --> 32:37.438
And that's when Buster heard his target.

32:37.480 --> 32:39.774
I got to go up and give my speech.

32:39.816 --> 32:41.860
You!

32:41.901 --> 32:44.111
Oh, hey, it's the Blind Side Monster.

32:46.197 --> 32:48.616
And so he blindsided him and became one.

32:49.951 --> 32:51.202
And it was amidst

32:51.243 --> 32:53.663
the rampaging of the blowback

32:53.705 --> 32:55.957
that a juiced-up Buster
noticed something horrifying.

33:12.015 --> 33:13.641
Oh, no.

33:13.683 --> 33:16.477
I'm in the movie.

33:16.519 --> 33:18.646
Oh, no.

33:24.027 --> 33:25.945
Buster tries to cover his tracks.

33:25.987 --> 33:26.863
Hey, nephew!

33:26.905 --> 33:28.155
New hand.

33:28.197 --> 33:29.782
It's cool. That's cool.

33:29.824 --> 33:33.202
You know that super-duper
privacy software you have?

33:33.244 --> 33:35.287
Does that work on security cameras?

33:35.329 --> 33:36.247
Of course, yeah.

33:36.288 --> 33:37.582
Works on everything.

33:37.623 --> 33:38.666
May I borrow it?

33:38.708 --> 33:40.710
One second.

33:42.045 --> 33:44.005
Here you go, Uncle Buster. I put it on

33:44.047 --> 33:45.757
a hard drive for you. Just
please be careful with it.

33:45.798 --> 33:47.592
Of course, of course.

33:50.636 --> 33:53.097
Have you got one with a case?

33:53.138 --> 33:54.557
Hey, Carl.

33:54.599 --> 33:55.767
Buster!

33:55.808 --> 33:57.476
And Buster visits

33:57.518 --> 34:00.312
a Balboa Towers guard
he'd known for many years

34:00.354 --> 34:01.940
for an impromptu lesson

34:01.981 --> 34:05.317
on how their footage
is gathered and stored.

34:05.359 --> 34:06.736
May I use your phone?

34:06.778 --> 34:09.237
But when Carl steps away,

34:09.280 --> 34:10.822
Buster goes into action

34:10.864 --> 34:13.826
and attempts to Fakeblock the footage.

34:13.868 --> 34:15.411
Oh.

34:15.453 --> 34:18.581
Sounds like it's working.

34:30.092 --> 34:31.010
Buster.

34:31.052 --> 34:32.177
Hey, Carl.

34:32.219 --> 34:34.013
- Everything okay?
- Mm-hmm.

34:34.054 --> 34:35.179
Bye, Carl.

34:35.222 --> 34:36.891
- Bye-bye, Buster.
- Okay.

34:47.902 --> 34:50.529
What she did to this boy.
