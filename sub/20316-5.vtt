WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.160
I'd like to welcome you all
to the grand opening

00:05.200 --> 00:07.440
of my very first nightclub.

00:07.480 --> 00:09.720
I now declare...

00:09.760 --> 00:12.920
Champagne Steam Rooms
officially open!

00:12.960 --> 00:14.640
-Oi! Whoa!
-Bloody hell!

00:14.680 --> 00:17.240
-Oh, mate!
-Oh, shit! Oh, for f...

00:17.280 --> 00:19.720
I didn't know it was red.

00:22.080 --> 00:24.840
Are the armadillo skin shoes
ruined as well?

00:24.880 --> 00:28.560
Got cheap wine
all over the bastards.

00:28.600 --> 00:31.000
-This is it, guys.
-Let me go first.

00:31.040 --> 00:34.280
-Welcome! Ah! Yes!
-Jesus.

00:34.320 --> 00:38.200
-Fucking speakers!
-Ah, look at the sound system!

00:38.240 --> 00:42.040
Guys, guys, guys,
welcome to my super-club.

00:42.080 --> 00:45.120
Look at that.
Smoke machine for the steam.

00:45.160 --> 00:47.480
-That is perfect.
-Look, wait, look.

00:47.520 --> 00:50.840
Wait. That is sick.

00:50.880 --> 00:54.080
This is going to be the
bit where, like, everyone's
trying to push through

00:54.120 --> 00:56.440
to get towards me and
I'm on stage like this,

00:56.480 --> 00:58.840
with you as well,
like that, yeah?

00:58.880 --> 01:01.160
And everyone's like, "Oh, can
I can touch man?" and that,

01:01.200 --> 01:04.360
and I'm gonna be fully
dripped in Moschino, like.

01:04.400 --> 01:07.240
-And where is the VIP,
cos I cannot see anything?
-Oh, VIP! Come through, guys.

01:07.280 --> 01:11.320
Welcome to the V-I-P.

01:11.360 --> 01:13.880
-Ah, gold chairs, yeah?
-Wow!

01:13.920 --> 01:17.560
Phew! A little taste
of how the other half live.

01:17.600 --> 01:20.120
[Grinda] <i> One of the main</i>
<i>things that you need sorted</i>

01:20.160 --> 01:22.920
<i>when you've got your own club
night, yeah, is just a room</i>

01:22.960 --> 01:26.560
you can go and chill out
and just get away from
the hectic fans and that.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.840
-Green room.
-Could be any colour.

01:28.880 --> 01:33.240
Just got, like, champagne in
ice buckets, pre-rolled zoots...

01:33.280 --> 01:36.600
What about them lovely sausage
rolls Miche did for your
packed lunch?

01:36.640 --> 01:38.680
We don't need saus...
Actually, yeah.

01:38.720 --> 01:42.440
Few sausage rolls to line the
stomach before we kill the set.

01:42.480 --> 01:46.520
-Whack 'em on the list, yeah.
-Sausage...roll.

01:46.560 --> 01:50.760
This is very much a team-based
area, so no-one else
will be allowed in.

01:50.800 --> 01:54.520
-Please back off, guys.
-Cos we're better than
everyone else!

01:54.560 --> 01:58.120
-Am I better than everyone?
-I doubt it, to be
honest, Steves.

01:58.160 --> 02:01.640
Stevie, I've got a job
for you if you want. You
could make another tenner.

02:01.680 --> 02:04.120
Steves, you are part of
the team, so you can come in.

02:04.160 --> 02:07.280
-Cool, man.
-But you'll very much
have to stand, still.

02:07.320 --> 02:09.759
-Cool. I'll just stand.
-Yeah.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.000
Still, red carpet treatment.

02:12.040 --> 02:14.000
Let me show you
the bar, come on.

02:14.040 --> 02:16.360
-There's a bar?
-Come through, come through.

02:16.400 --> 02:18.680
What's the bar's name, Decoy?

02:18.720 --> 02:21.400
Welcome to the
Champagne Cocktails!

02:21.440 --> 02:23.480
Oh, fuck off! Fuck off!

02:23.520 --> 02:26.600
-What is that?
-Shut up, there's sand here!

02:26.640 --> 02:30.840
-Hey, guys, what cocktail
do you want?
-[laughter]

02:30.880 --> 02:35.040
-I think that's probably
you done now, actually.
-Is it?

02:35.080 --> 02:37.560
-Susan's only got one
customer left, so...
-Okay.

02:37.600 --> 02:41.560
Actually, Miche...
can I have a quick word?

02:41.600 --> 02:45.040
Oh, Tanya, sorry, is it
about the hair straighteners?

02:45.080 --> 02:48.240
Cos I was borrowing them cos
me and Angel were trying out
some Rihanna looks on her.

02:48.280 --> 02:52.600
No, don't worry about that.
It's actually about
your contract.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.960
You know your probation
period is up now?

02:55.000 --> 02:57.360
-Yeah.
-And...

02:57.400 --> 03:00.360
-We'd like to offer you
the position full-time!
-Really?!

03:00.400 --> 03:03.720
-Yes!
-Ah, amazing! That's so great!

03:03.760 --> 03:05.640
Is Angela going to be
full-time as well, then?

03:05.680 --> 03:08.320
Angela's going back to college.
That's sort of why we...

03:08.360 --> 03:13.400
Sorry, so just to confirm, I've
got the job but Angela has not?

03:13.440 --> 03:16.240
-Yeah, it's just you.
-Oh, God!

03:16.280 --> 03:19.040
And she's been here
longer than me. Oh, dear.

03:19.080 --> 03:22.600
-Obviously, you don't have
to say yes right now.
-Yeah.

03:22.640 --> 03:25.880
Have a think about it tonight.
Let me know tomorrow. Yes?

03:25.920 --> 03:29.160
Definitely. Amazing.
Thank you, Tanya. This
is brilliant news. Yeah.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.880
-I'll need to check with
my boyfriend...
-Fiancé.

03:31.920 --> 03:35.360
Fiancé, yeah. But I'm sure
he'll be really happy about
it, so it's brilliant.

03:42.440 --> 03:44.960
Nah, the strands are too thick.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.600
-[door closes]
-Miche? Ah, thank
fuck you're back.

03:48.640 --> 03:52.080
I'm trying to get these
strands right, but I can't
get 'em spot-on like you.

03:52.120 --> 03:54.680
I got the job, baby!

03:54.720 --> 03:57.440
-Yeah?
-Yeah, I'm full-time
now at Lavender!

03:57.480 --> 04:01.360
-I thought you had a job?
-No, I've been on probation for
the last two weeks, remember?

04:01.400 --> 04:03.320
Is it? Can you come
and do this, please?

04:03.360 --> 04:05.960
To be honest, Miche, I reckon
you don't even need a job,

04:06.000 --> 04:07.880
cos with all this
rave shit going off,

04:07.920 --> 04:11.320
I reckon you should focus
just on my hair from now on.

04:11.360 --> 04:15.360
Yeah, no one can get it
done like you, anyway, so it's
better off that way, innit?

04:15.400 --> 04:17.600
<i>Nah, I ain't happy
Miche has got a job.</i>

04:17.640 --> 04:21.519
To be honest,
she's showing herself up
and she's showing me up.

04:21.560 --> 04:26.880
Cos it's embarrassing, innit?
One of the highly-skilled
MCs in the area, yeah?

04:26.920 --> 04:31.240
And his missus is working.
Look at the Premiership
footballers...

04:31.280 --> 04:34.360
-[director] But you don't
earn as much as they do.
-No, but one day I will earn...

04:34.400 --> 04:36.920
more than them,
if I want.

04:40.240 --> 04:43.080
Chabuddy G is back
on the London party scene.

04:43.120 --> 04:45.560
I am the bloody
London party scene!

04:45.600 --> 04:48.800
Lock up your daughters.
Actually, don't lock
up your daughters.

04:48.840 --> 04:51.480
Lock up your mother,
lock up your aunties

04:51.520 --> 04:54.400
and any other women
of legal age limit!

04:54.440 --> 04:59.400
Chabuddy G, aka 50 Shades
Of Brown, is ready for action!

05:01.640 --> 05:04.560
[Beats]
What's that? What's that?

05:04.600 --> 05:06.600
What's going on up here?

05:06.640 --> 05:09.200
Nah, nothing. Craig's
letting me use his Lynx.

05:09.240 --> 05:12.320
-He's actually perfected
the perfect blend.
-Yeah?

05:12.360 --> 05:16.960
-So is it just
two sprays of Excite?
-No, no. One spray of Excite.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.400
Two sprays of Dark Temptation.

05:20.440 --> 05:25.000
And then, the last bit,
just a mist of Africa.

05:25.040 --> 05:27.840
[whistles]
Let me try that.

05:27.880 --> 05:29.800
[Roche coughs]

05:32.800 --> 05:36.800
Yeah. Perfect. Now
I've got a man who smells
exactly the same as my son!

05:36.840 --> 05:40.440
I was just wondering,
should I bring my expandable
truncheon, do you reckon?

05:40.480 --> 05:43.440
-Definitely, I want you
both to have a good time.
-Yeah?

05:43.480 --> 05:45.440
And if any gurning 19-year-old
gets out of hand...

05:45.480 --> 05:48.360
Smash! Boom!
Back of the knee.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.760
I'll just go, bang, upwards.
Bring them back up.

05:50.800 --> 05:53.400
[director] So are you
looking forward to the rave?

05:53.440 --> 05:57.520
This might sound awful, but I'm
hoping something kicks off.
That would make my night.

05:57.560 --> 06:00.160
And then I'd get right
round his neck, right round.

06:00.200 --> 06:04.520
<i>So I'm sort of looking
forward to it, but I'm...
I'm a bit, you know...</i>

06:04.560 --> 06:07.920
Imagine a whole
warehouse of "them".

06:07.960 --> 06:11.000
You hurt my collarbone, man.
You always take it too far.

06:11.040 --> 06:12.920
Just got a bit excited, love.

06:12.960 --> 06:15.880
-[knocking on door]
-Miche! Door!

06:15.920 --> 06:17.680
No, I'm getting ready.

06:19.600 --> 06:22.080
I thought you were supposed
to be gone already.

06:22.120 --> 06:25.600
-Miche, there's a homeless
woman at the door.
-What? Shut the door then!

06:25.640 --> 06:28.880
-Little twat.
-Whatever. Even Angel
says I'm better than you.

06:28.920 --> 06:31.960
-I like your top.
-Thank you, darling.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.560
So you sure you'll be able
to get the bus on your own?

06:35.600 --> 06:38.600
Yeah, it's fine, cos Mum's
got to do my hair first.

06:38.640 --> 06:41.560
All right, cool. Well,
you are on the VIP list, so...

06:41.600 --> 06:44.600
-So you'll be right at the top.
-Could you put me down
as Lady Miche?

06:44.640 --> 06:47.400
-Just cos that's my Twitter
name, so sounds classier.
-Yeah.

06:47.440 --> 06:50.560
It does sound pretty classy,
yeah. All right, cool.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.800
Well, um...Decoy's outside.

06:52.840 --> 06:55.840
-Better go, cos he's downstairs
right now. See you later.
-Bye!

06:58.880 --> 07:02.720
[singing] What's the other
one? There's a better one.

07:02.760 --> 07:06.480
-Er, bad biggidy boy.
-[he sings]

07:06.520 --> 07:08.400
Vocal warm-ups.

07:08.440 --> 07:10.840
Mind out the way,
VIP coming through.

07:10.880 --> 07:14.160
-Yeah, fuck off!
-See you in a bit, yeah?

07:14.200 --> 07:16.400
All right, yeah.

07:16.440 --> 07:18.280
Woo!

07:18.320 --> 07:21.080
[dance music plays]

07:25.040 --> 07:27.400
This is shit!

07:29.640 --> 07:32.160
There's hardly anyone here.

07:32.200 --> 07:35.640
It's half 11,
there's meant to be a
sea of people everywhere.

07:35.680 --> 07:38.040
What the fuck
are we going to do?

07:38.080 --> 07:42.760
[Nan] Don't you let that
little mug tell you what you
should do with your life.

07:42.800 --> 07:45.200
If you want to do it,
you should just go for it.

07:45.240 --> 07:48.880
Yeah, Yolo, but also you have
been divorced four times.

07:48.920 --> 07:51.160
Oi, oi! Three times,
if you don't mind!

07:51.200 --> 07:53.360
-We're talking about you.
-Yeah.

07:53.400 --> 07:56.200
You don't need anybody, yeah?
Chelle, you are beautiful.

07:56.240 --> 07:58.960
-Thanks, Mum.
-I'm going to call her.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.080
-I'm just going to do it.
-Are you?

08:01.120 --> 08:04.400
-Yeah.
-What, right now? All
right. I'll pour us a drink.

08:04.440 --> 08:06.520
Go on, then.

08:06.560 --> 08:09.520
Talk, like...
talk nice and everything.

08:09.560 --> 08:12.760
-Yeah, I'll do my posh voice.
-Do your telephone voice!

08:12.800 --> 08:16.000
-Oh, it's ringing.
-If it goes to answerphone,
put it down.

08:16.040 --> 08:18.480
Hi, Tanya!

08:18.520 --> 08:22.040
Oh, God, sorry.
Oh, did I wake you up?

08:22.080 --> 08:26.160
Sorry, I'm drunk. I didn't
realise what time it was.

08:29.400 --> 08:32.760
Yeah, well, I was just calling
to say that I will take the job.

08:32.799 --> 08:37.520
We can talk about it more
tomorrow? Yeah, it's fine.

08:37.559 --> 08:42.159
Yeah, no problem. Yep.
No, sleep well. Yeah. No...

08:42.200 --> 08:45.320
"Sleep well"! You just
woke her up, you prat!

08:45.360 --> 08:47.600
[laughs]

08:47.640 --> 08:50.240
-Cheers to the new job!
-To you, darling.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.680
-To you and me.
-And Angel.

08:52.720 --> 08:55.360
-And Angel.
-To Angel.

08:55.400 --> 08:57.920
-And your new boyfriend?
-Yeah.

08:57.960 --> 09:00.800
How was it when you
went to go and see him?

09:00.840 --> 09:03.680
He's nice.
I mean, he's well fit. 18.

09:03.720 --> 09:06.680
Really? Wow, that's
the youngest yet, isn't it?

09:06.720 --> 09:09.040
Not really.

09:11.240 --> 09:13.080
Where's...?

09:13.120 --> 09:15.840
There's not even
a champagne bucket.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.080
What...?
Excuse... Why is...?

09:23.120 --> 09:25.760
Why is there people walking
through the VIP bit?

09:27.600 --> 09:29.680
The toilet's
just there, mate.

09:29.720 --> 09:32.800
That's ridiculous! It stinks!

09:32.840 --> 09:35.920
-Do you know
if I'm meant to wipe them?
-What's that?

09:35.960 --> 09:39.520
-Am I supposed to wipe them?
-Whatever you're comfortable
with, Steves.

09:39.560 --> 09:42.680
-Tell them no shitting!
-No shitting. No shitting.

09:42.720 --> 09:45.440
No shitting? All right.

09:45.480 --> 09:48.400
Er...hello?

09:48.440 --> 09:51.560
-I'm gonna go chat to Chabuds.
-Yeah, sort it out!

09:51.600 --> 09:56.120
Sorry, mate.
Just to say that there's
actually a no-shitting rule now,

09:56.160 --> 09:58.480
so if you've started,
just kind of clench.

09:58.520 --> 10:01.480
Or just suck it back in.

10:01.520 --> 10:03.720
-You all right?
-Not really.

10:03.760 --> 10:07.880
-You got a bucket
for the champagne?
-I was going to give you that.

10:07.920 --> 10:10.560
That's just a bucket.

10:10.600 --> 10:14.280
Yeah, no, it's a gold
bucket, mate. Turn it round!

10:14.320 --> 10:17.160
-It's a champagne bucket.
-Exactly!

10:17.200 --> 10:20.400
Cheers, mate. You're the man,
bruv. See you in a bit.

10:20.440 --> 10:24.080
Got the champagne bucket.

10:26.440 --> 10:28.080
Fuck!

10:33.120 --> 10:35.640
Can I get a water,
please, mate?

10:35.680 --> 10:38.400
We don't actually
do waters, but, uh...

10:38.440 --> 10:41.480
Actually, yeah, why not?
Um...

10:41.520 --> 10:45.560
Waters are £3.
I can do you two for £5.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.840
-You want them?
-Yeah, mate.

10:47.880 --> 10:51.480
Two bottles of water, yeah?
Okay, two bottles of water.

10:53.000 --> 10:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:00.680 --> 11:03.600
-There we go, mate, that's £5.
-Cheers, mate.

11:03.640 --> 11:05.480
Cheers.

11:10.640 --> 11:14.200
We could call a few people,
get them to come down.

11:14.240 --> 11:17.440
Nah, I ain't doing that!
That's just...

11:17.480 --> 11:20.840
Do you know what?
This is all you, mate!

11:20.880 --> 11:25.560
Cos you fucked up the promotion
by fucking off with Craig
on your little fishing trip!

11:25.600 --> 11:28.240
Don't talk about Craig.
He's got a heart of gold.

11:28.280 --> 11:31.000
"Don't talk about Craig," yeah?
I tell you what,

11:31.040 --> 11:35.040
why don't you and Craig go
and fucking do a set to, like,
three, four people or whatever?

11:35.080 --> 11:38.640
Cos I ain't fuckin' doing it.
Get the fuck out my way.

11:54.520 --> 11:57.720
-You got a light, bruv?
-Yeah.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.840
What's all this about, then?

12:03.880 --> 12:06.960
They was meant to be filming
me MC-ing in there, but...

12:07.000 --> 12:09.240
-Fuck off.
-What?

12:09.280 --> 12:11.280
-You MC Grindah?
-Er, yeah.

12:11.320 --> 12:13.520
-Mate, let me get a picture.
-Yeah, yeah.

12:13.560 --> 12:15.800
-Aaron, you got your phone?
-Yeah.

12:15.840 --> 12:18.200
-Throw your "K's" up as well.
-Yeah.

12:18.240 --> 12:22.160
Get the champers in there.
Did you get that?

12:22.200 --> 12:27.120
[director] Are you nervous
about telling Grindah
that you've taken the job?

12:27.160 --> 12:29.640
I think I just need
to tell him he's wrong.

12:29.680 --> 12:33.120
There's this thing
now on social media
and it's called feminism.

12:33.160 --> 12:36.120
It's basically all about women,
you know, we're all equal, so...

12:36.160 --> 12:39.280
why can't we wear
the trousers too?

12:39.320 --> 12:41.600
Although, it does depend
on your physique.

12:41.640 --> 12:44.000
Cos if you've got
an apple-shaped body,

12:44.040 --> 12:47.360
then you need to conceal
the trunk and let your
legs do the talking.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.400

13:05.760 --> 13:09.000
Let's get out
of here, me and you.
Let's get out of this place.

13:09.040 --> 13:11.960
-Can I just get
a cocktail, please?
-Yeah, no worries.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.520
Start with a cocktail first.

13:16.520 --> 13:18.920
Oh, whoa!
What you got there?

13:18.960 --> 13:21.880
-The old Jack and Jills, is it?
-Yeah.

13:21.920 --> 13:24.040
Fuck it, have one, innit?

13:24.080 --> 13:26.560
-I'm all good.
-What, you don't get on it?

13:26.600 --> 13:29.160
These ones are banging, mate.
Trust me. I ain't some mug!

13:29.200 --> 13:32.560
No, I do get on it. I've got
this and I'll probably be
full off that.

13:32.600 --> 13:37.640
I do do them,
obviously, but more after
the set if anything, so...

13:37.680 --> 13:40.440
Oh, I'll have one.

13:40.480 --> 13:42.840
Cheers, mate.

13:42.880 --> 13:45.400
Oh, these ones, are they?

13:47.680 --> 13:49.600
-All right.
-Oh, good.

13:49.640 --> 13:53.040
-Did you take it?
-Yeah, I took it.

13:53.080 --> 13:56.800
Give me another one, then,
if you don't believe me.

13:56.840 --> 14:00.840
You actually want me
to do another one?

14:00.880 --> 14:04.080
-Just do it, mate.
-Yeah, I will just do it.

So I'm on the VIP list.

14:35.840 --> 14:38.240
So I'm down as Lady Miche
on the list.

No, there's no list,
you can just go in.

14:48.400 --> 14:51.080

-Okay.

14:51.120 --> 14:54.480
What kind of guys do you
like to have sex with?

14:54.520 --> 14:56.880
Ah, no worries.
Can I help you?

14:58.840 --> 15:00.880
Decoy. Have you seen Grindah?

15:03.320 --> 15:06.760

seen Grindah?
-Oh, yeah.

He came out earlier.
He was all pouting and sulky.

15:30.840 --> 15:33.920
I didn't see
where he went cos I was
dealing with these nonces.

that on his head?
It's like a Shoreditch samurai.

23:14.480 --> 23:17.680
I'm sorry about
being defensive earlier.

23:17.720 --> 23:21.040
It's cos of Craig and that,
like. You know what it's
like being a dad.

23:21.080 --> 23:24.480
Don't even try that, brother.
I'm sorry, bruv.

23:24.520 --> 23:28.280
Craig opened up to me the
other day. He called me Dad.

23:28.320 --> 23:32.200
Are you serious?
Bruv, that's fucking sick!

23:32.240 --> 23:35.480
-Yeah.
-Eh, come here,
you fucking sickhead.

23:35.520 --> 23:38.840
Ah, man, that's what
I'm saying about you, man.

23:38.880 --> 23:44.320
You know, I proposed to Miche
earlier, sort of like,
by mistake.

23:44.360 --> 23:47.040
But I feel all
right for doing it.

23:47.080 --> 23:51.360
That's amazing, man. That's
what it's about, though, innit?

23:51.400 --> 23:53.560
-Yeah.
-It's about family and that.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.920
It's true.
It's fucking true.

23:56.960 --> 23:58.440
Always.

24:01.400 --> 24:04.840
Hello, mate, there's
a no-shitting rule tonight
but apart from that...

24:08.360 --> 24:11.840
This is what having your
own club does to people!

24:11.880 --> 24:14.720
She can't bloody
get enough, mate!

24:14.760 --> 24:16.680
Oh...

24:19.200 --> 24:21.520
All right, mate?

24:21.560 --> 24:24.760
Steves, can you do me a favour?
Can you take over the bar
for a minute?

24:24.800 --> 24:27.520
-Yeah.
-I've pulled, mate! Yeah.

24:27.560 --> 24:31.800
And I think, yeah...
I think she might be
really special, this one.

24:31.840 --> 24:34.640
-She does seem nice, man.
-Yeah.

24:34.680 --> 24:37.080
-Cheers, Stevie.
-Cool.

24:38.440 --> 24:41.160
The return of the queen!

24:41.200 --> 24:43.440
-What?
-Shall we boogie?
Let's boogie. Come on!

24:45.560 --> 24:49.760
Abdi, back off, mate!
Abdi, you're too close!

24:55.440 --> 24:58.880
-You all right?
-Yeah.

24:58.920 --> 25:02.720
-Why are you so sweaty?
-I think it's cos I'm nervous.

25:02.760 --> 25:05.320
-Roche...
-Yeah?

25:05.360 --> 25:07.920
I need to tell you something.

25:07.960 --> 25:10.520
Basically, Grindah
proposed to Michelle.

25:10.560 --> 25:13.400
-Oh!
-And it made me think that...

25:13.440 --> 25:15.840
maybe we should do the same.

25:15.880 --> 25:19.960
That's very romantic.
Let's talk about it
tomorrow, eh, Kevin?

25:20.000 --> 25:23.160
Nah, cos Craig called
me Dad this week.

25:23.200 --> 25:26.280
And it made me think
that we're a family.

25:26.320 --> 25:29.320
Maybe we could
be a proper family.

25:29.360 --> 25:33.520
I love you, Roche.

25:33.560 --> 25:36.560
Get up! You're only meant
to go on one knee, all right?

25:36.600 --> 25:39.920
-Is it?
-If you still feel like it,
ask me tomorrow, yeah?

25:39.960 --> 25:42.880
-Yeah, I definitely will.
-Okay, I look forward to that.

25:42.920 --> 25:45.760
Yeah. All right?
Go and enjoy yourself, Romeo.

25:45.800 --> 25:47.600
Safe.

25:52.320 --> 25:54.920
Mate! I'm having
the sickest time.

25:54.960 --> 25:58.000
Bruv, your jacket smells a
bit weird. Stay back a bit.

25:58.040 --> 26:00.960
-I can't believe
we've done this, man.
-This is amazing!

26:03.720 --> 26:06.400
Is your tummy still
feeling poorly?

26:06.440 --> 26:09.080
Yeah, it still
hurts quite a lot.

26:09.120 --> 26:11.800
How are your dark
thoughts getting on?

26:15.240 --> 26:17.960
Get you all tucked in.

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
-I still feel pretty sad,
to be honest.
-Put your head up.

26:22.040 --> 26:25.560
Oh, don't worry. I've got
something that'll cheer you up.

26:25.600 --> 26:28.080
I knew you probably wouldn't
want to go out today,

26:28.120 --> 26:30.760
so I just popped out
and I got a ring, so...

26:30.800 --> 26:33.160
What? Ah, fuck!

26:33.200 --> 26:35.120
Aww!

26:35.160 --> 26:37.200
[Angel] Mummy!

26:37.240 --> 26:40.480
-Here she is! Yay!
-I've got my dress on.

26:40.520 --> 26:43.000
Me and Angel have been
practising, so, yeah.

26:43.040 --> 26:46.400
-Can't believe that
we're engaged now.
-Congratulations!

26:46.440 --> 26:49.000
-Oh, yeah. We don't...
-Keep holding them.

26:49.040 --> 26:52.240
..necessarily
need to tell everyone
we're engaged, Miche.

26:52.280 --> 26:56.280
People stay engaged for
a long time before they
actually tell anyone.

26:56.320 --> 27:00.040
-Yeah.
-Can we just...talk
about this another time?

27:00.080 --> 27:02.880
I'm feeling pretty sick,
to be honest.

27:02.920 --> 27:05.480
Until next time, my queen!

27:05.520 --> 27:08.800
Just promise me
one thing, baby.

27:08.840 --> 27:11.720
Don't fall in love.
I'm damaged goods.

27:11.760 --> 27:16.160
Oh, hey, guys. Come in.
[chuckles]

27:16.200 --> 27:19.560
That's embarrassing, innit?
Bed's still unmade.

27:19.600 --> 27:21.760
[sniffs]
What's that smell?

27:21.800 --> 27:24.640
I'll tell you what that is,
that's the smell of sex.

27:24.680 --> 27:26.760
With a little bit
of very basic foreplay.

27:26.800 --> 27:29.120
[Roche] You all right?

27:29.160 --> 27:31.280
[Beats] I think if I cough,
I might shit myself.

27:31.320 --> 27:33.000
Oh!

27:36.280 --> 27:38.960
There you go, that's for you.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.440
Craig, man, you legend.
Thanks, man.

27:42.480 --> 27:45.920
See you had a good time
last night, as well...

27:45.960 --> 27:48.560
-chewing that bird's face off.
-What girl?

27:48.600 --> 27:51.560
Yeah, she was all right.
Bit sweaty, though.

27:51.600 --> 27:54.480
You guys done me proud
last night, man. Both of you.

27:54.520 --> 27:56.840
You didn't do
too badly yourself.

27:56.880 --> 28:00.280
'Ere, is there anything
you wanted to talk about today?

28:00.320 --> 28:03.400
-No, not really.
-Nothing you wanted to ask me?

28:03.440 --> 28:04.960
No.

28:06.800 --> 28:09.800
You see, you see
what I said last night...

28:09.840 --> 28:13.080
-Mmm?
-outside and...and that...

28:13.120 --> 28:15.920
Yeah, don't worry, you twat,
I'm only joking!

28:15.960 --> 28:18.000
Ah, fucking hell!

28:18.040 --> 28:21.280
-Cos I was going to leave
today, like, just run.
-Were you?

28:21.320 --> 28:25.600
-For a bit and then come back.
-Okay. [she laughs]

28:27.880 --> 28:30.280
[Beats] Success means different
things to different people.

28:30.320 --> 28:33.960
But, to me, success
isn't about money.

28:34.000 --> 28:38.040
-It's about family
and love, innit?
-Nah.

28:38.080 --> 28:41.840
[Grindah] Everyone's got
a family. We've got that
and the club night, so...

28:41.880 --> 28:43.800
-Truesay.
-Yeah.

28:43.840 --> 28:46.800
-We're quite inspirational,
really, innit?
-Yeah.

28:46.840 --> 28:49.760
What I would say is if you're
watching this right now,

28:49.800 --> 28:52.120
and you're feeling
bare inspired,

28:52.160 --> 28:56.200
remember, MC Grindah
told you, you can achieve
anything you want in life.

28:56.240 --> 28:59.120
-Anything.
-Well, not...

28:59.160 --> 29:01.960
Within reason, obviously.
Be realistic about it.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.200
[Beats] Do something that
you're probably already
quite good at,

29:05.240 --> 29:07.920
-just make it easier.
-Yeah, exactly.

29:07.960 --> 29:12.160
Set your goals low so that
you might be able
to achieve them.

29:13.200 --> 29:14.800
No one likes a failure.
