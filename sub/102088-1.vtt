Julius there are bigger
issues to be talking about,

Think about that answer.

41:28.430 --> 41:31.533

41:31.566 --> 41:33.735
You think his ass gonna follow
through if they pick up him?

41:33.768 --> 41:35.637

41:43.111 --> 41:47.449

47:29.090 --> 47:31.125
That nigga look suspect as fuck

Point two none of

47:39.000 --> 47:40.168
and I can already

47:40.201 --> 47:41.903
Shit I ain't trying
to get snachted bro.

47:41.936 --> 47:43.405
Right?

47:43.439 --> 47:46.274
That nigga do
got a 4.0 though,

47:46.307 --> 47:47.509
If we do this shit right,

47:47.543 --> 47:50.512
Aint no body going
to get snatched.

47:50.546 --> 47:51.779
It's my line.

47:52.880 --> 47:54.282
And I want him on.

47:56.418 --> 47:57.285
Aight.

47:58.554 --> 47:59.887

48:00.822 --> 48:02.223
Mufasa has spoken.

48:20.908 --> 48:22.877
And what of us here Julius?

48:22.910 --> 48:24.178
What of us here?

48:25.313 --> 48:26.881
This is second time.

48:26.914 --> 48:29.418
I'm seeing you in 10 years
and you come with nothing.

48:29.451 --> 48:31.520
How do you expect me
to do this by myself?

48:31.553 --> 48:34.556
Everything I have goes to you

48:34.590 --> 48:36.458
and the ministry.

48:36.492 --> 48:39.360
Please trust that the
Lord will provide.

48:39.395 --> 48:42.063
You stay in America and you
take care of everyone else.

48:42.096 --> 48:45.366
While your son is
stuck here in poverty.

48:46.468 --> 48:47.368
Do you not care?

48:47.403 --> 48:48.369
You don't care for us anymore?

48:48.404 --> 48:50.338
That is not fair.

48:50.371 --> 48:54.175
It's not fair to put
yourself up against God.

48:54.208 --> 48:56.412
That is not God its you.

48:56.445 --> 48:58.447
Don't give me that non sense.

48:58.480 --> 49:02.418
Your son cannot eat, that
is on you not on God,

49:04.453 --> 49:08.956
My dear, we serve a God
who meets all of our needs.

49:11.192 --> 49:12.461
Get off of me.

49:16.164 --> 49:20.101
Young pastor, look at
how big you have become,

49:24.673 --> 49:25.507
Mama what happened?

49:25.541 --> 49:28.042

49:28.076 --> 49:29.344
You don't see

49:29.377 --> 49:30.978
Mama please talk

1:02:00.261 --> 1:02:03.264
My father he was
also a missionary

1:02:07.368 --> 1:02:08.870
I know you've never met him,

1:02:08.903 --> 1:02:11.139
but he was a very great man.

1:02:15.009 --> 1:02:19.848
Your grandfather would
leave for years at that time

1:02:19.881 --> 1:02:21.282
all for Gods work.

1:02:24.185 --> 1:02:27.055

That is your calling.

1:02:37.298 --> 1:02:39.367
I want you to come

1:02:39.401 --> 1:02:42.070
to finish your schooling there.

1:02:43.171 --> 1:02:46.241
I'm working on getting
a visa for you.

1:02:49.310 --> 1:02:51.012
What about mummy?

1:02:54.349 --> 1:02:56.918
Her situation is different.

1:03:01.789 --> 1:03:05.226
There's no point of
you being here anymore.

1:03:07.095 --> 1:03:08.796
The Lord has a plan.

1:03:10.932 --> 1:03:14.702
My young pastor it's

1:03:15.471 --> 1:03:16.938

1:03:23.778 --> 1:03:25.313

Kneel down, and be

1:04:19.968 --> 1:04:24.506
Father, We come to you with
hearts full of repentance.

1:04:44.959 --> 1:04:45.994
Marks of manhood.

1:04:46.027 --> 1:04:48.530
The marks of a man are
discipline, diligence, loyalty,

1:04:48.564 --> 1:04:52.735
leadership and spiritual
connection higher self.

1:04:56.104 --> 1:04:57.238

1:04:59.541 --> 1:05:01.075

1:05:04.413 --> 1:05:05.547
Why must a man be disciplined?

1:05:05.581 --> 1:05:08.484
A man must be disciplined to
activate a personal initiative

1:05:08.517 --> 1:05:09.585
towards achieving goals.

1:05:09.618 --> 1:05:12.186

1:05:38.112 --> 1:05:39.180
The quicker you get off, man.

1:05:39.213 --> 1:05:40.549

1:06:23.392 --> 1:06:25.893
I went up to the other
day for Mayfield fat ass.

1:06:25.927 --> 1:06:28.096

1:06:28.129 --> 1:06:30.064

1:06:30.098 --> 1:06:34.335

1:06:34.369 --> 1:06:36.337

1:06:47.181 --> 1:06:48.349
For real though.

1:06:48.384 --> 1:06:49.984
I'm starting to forget
the point in this shit.

1:06:50.017 --> 1:06:51.687
I know the point aint
trying to be paper.

1:06:51.720 --> 1:06:54.021

1:06:54.055 --> 1:06:55.356

1:06:57.158 --> 1:06:58.226

Man I never realized how
long the fucking day was man.

1:07:00.995 --> 1:07:03.030
These rules are
fucking ridiculous.

1:07:03.064 --> 1:07:06.267
Shit can't listen to
music, can't talk to girls,

1:07:06.300 --> 1:07:07.403
can't eat meat.

1:07:07.436 --> 1:07:09.405
Shit I talk to girls,

1:07:09.438 --> 1:07:12.340
The Buffalo Wild
Wing bitch don't count.

I ain't trying to have
Mayfield on my ass tomorrow,

1:07:25.186 --> 1:07:26.688
Man, that nigga so extreme.

1:07:26.722 --> 1:07:27.723
That so extreme.

1:07:27.756 --> 1:07:29.090
How you growing with kids
still pleasuring niggas

1:07:29.123 --> 1:07:30.426

Okay, all right.

1:08:12.468 --> 1:08:14.736
Get it right there you go.

1:08:22.478 --> 1:08:24.613
Jerrell, Tell me why a
man has to be intelligent?

1:08:24.646 --> 1:08:26.080
A man must be
intelligent because

1:08:26.113 --> 1:08:27.382
he has virtues of hard work,

1:08:27.416 --> 1:08:28.517
You can work hard without
being intelligent.

1:08:28.550 --> 1:08:31.118
Intelligence is the consistency
of hard work big brother sir

1:08:31.152 --> 1:08:32.454
Yes sir.

1:08:51.072 --> 1:08:52.240

your feet together.

Lamar, why must
a man be loyal?

1:08:54.075 --> 1:08:56.778
A man must be loyal
to affect the

1:08:56.812 --> 1:08:59.515
in genuine relationship loyalty
is a rare characteristic

1:08:59.548 --> 1:09:02.718
becoming a man of
loyalty is sir

1:09:02.751 --> 1:09:04.386
Yes sir.

1:09:04.419 --> 1:09:06.555
Come on, okay that's it.

1:09:08.289 --> 1:09:09.156
My God.

1:09:13.495 --> 1:09:15.129
Dayo why must a
man be a leader?

1:09:15.162 --> 1:09:18.400
A man needs

1:09:20.435 --> 1:09:21.302
Yes sir.

1:09:31.312 --> 1:09:34.115
Why must a man have
spiritual connection?

1:09:34.148 --> 1:09:37.553
A man must sir

1:09:39.253 --> 1:09:40.389

vigil tonight?

1:10:43.452 --> 1:10:44.318

Congratulations by the
way, you're gonna love it.

1:11:23.257 --> 1:11:25.494
I'm just kind of mad
you didn't tell me.

1:11:25.527 --> 1:11:26.428
We have a rule.

1:11:26.461 --> 1:11:27.361
Yeah, yeah.

1:11:27.396 --> 1:11:28.530
Not talking to girls.

1:11:28.563 --> 1:11:31.232
I know, but it's BS though.

1:11:31.265 --> 1:11:33.435
No one actually follows it.

1:11:36.405 --> 1:11:37.906
Don't you guys have set tonight?

1:11:37.939 --> 1:11:41.208

wants me to stay here.

1:11:41.242 --> 1:11:43.779
You told your pros right?

1:11:46.915 --> 1:11:47.783
Hold on.

1:11:52.854 --> 1:11:54.956

1:11:56.458 --> 1:11:57.526

So here are the

1:12:38.734 --> 1:12:40.702
Dayo who's that woman?

1:12:40.736 --> 1:12:41.770
You know her?

1:12:48.577 --> 1:12:49.644
No I don't.

1:12:51.713 --> 1:12:54.916
I always thought
she was your mother.

1:13:15.604 --> 1:13:16.805
Who is she?

1:13:16.838 --> 1:13:18.507
Stop trying to
change the subject?

1:13:18.540 --> 1:13:19.708

I know he's not
better with you.

1:13:27.549 --> 1:13:29.584
You are fake, you are all fake.

1:13:29.618 --> 1:13:32.587
Fake Christians love of
yourself and not of God.

1:13:32.621 --> 1:13:33.855
Shut up.

1:13:33.889 --> 1:13:35.023
Shut your mouth.

1:13:35.056 --> 1:13:36.958
You left me here
for 15 years by myself

1:13:36.992 --> 1:13:39.828
to raise your son and
now you want to take him.

1:13:39.861 --> 1:13:42.631
No,
keep quiet, I won't.

I am a man of
God, I cannot lie.

1:13:49.004 --> 1:13:53.041

can't escape that.

1:17:20.248 --> 1:17:22.784
What was Nicole doing here?

1:17:24.719 --> 1:17:27.589
Well, I practiced
in a song sir.

1:17:29.057 --> 1:17:30.225
For church sir.

1:17:33.795 --> 1:17:36.765
So your shirt

1:17:36.798 --> 1:17:38.199

1:17:41.936 --> 1:17:42.804
Don't lie.

1:17:44.839 --> 1:17:46.274
She wanted to see something.

1:17:46.307 --> 1:17:48.309
Me too, I want to see.

1:17:49.377 --> 1:17:50.311

I've been playing football
school and it got rough.

1:18:16.271 --> 1:18:19.140
You need to be more careful.

1:18:19.174 --> 1:18:20.375
You can't be playing rough

1:18:20.409 --> 1:18:22.210

1:18:22.243 --> 1:18:23.611

1:18:23.645 --> 1:18:25.213
What did you put on it?

1:18:25.246 --> 1:18:26.948
Nicole was telling
me what to put on it.

1:18:26.981 --> 1:18:29.217
Okay, okay no problem.

1:18:29.250 --> 1:18:30.985

1:39:19.401 --> 1:39:22.270
Look guys, I'm
sorry but I'm done.

1:39:26.442 --> 1:39:28.410
We might have to drop you bro.

1:39:28.444 --> 1:39:29.844
Nah, hell no.

1:39:30.978 --> 1:39:31.846
Fuck that.

1:39:33.515 --> 1:39:38.353
We started this together and
we finishing it together.

1:39:38.387 --> 1:39:40.855
If you're done, we all done.

1:39:41.523 --> 1:39:43.091
Wait, you serious?

1:39:43.124 --> 1:39:45.494
How the fuck can
you question at Lamar?

1:39:45.527 --> 1:39:47.228
He's right.

1:39:47.261 --> 1:39:49.531
Look, I don't care if
we haven't crossed yet

1:39:49.565 --> 1:39:51.132
your my brothers.

1:39:53.334 --> 1:39:55.471
If you are out we all out.

1:39:56.672 --> 1:39:59.941
You only had a
few more days to go.

1:40:03.479 --> 1:40:05.213
It's up to you, bro.

1:40:07.014 --> 1:40:08.249
At the end of the day,

1:40:08.282 --> 1:40:12.153
you have to decide
how to live your life.

1:40:12.186 --> 1:40:14.989
It's not about who your
dad wants you to be.

1:40:15.022 --> 1:40:17.626
It ain't even
about what we want.

1:40:18.694 --> 1:40:20.496
You are your own man.

1:40:53.995 --> 1:40:54.663
Dad,

1:40:56.264 --> 1:40:58.166
You can't stay here anymore.

1:40:58.199 --> 1:40:59.267
Dad really?

1:41:00.636 --> 1:41:03.337
You are filled with
rebellious spirit.

1:41:03.371 --> 1:41:05.039
Are you for real?

1:41:06.442 --> 1:41:08.109
Are you even a Christian?

1:41:08.142 --> 1:41:09.110
What?

1:41:10.044 --> 1:41:11.580
You need to repent?

1:41:11.613 --> 1:41:14.982
I need a father,
not a preacher.

1:41:23.024 --> 1:41:24.192
Where do you want me to go?

1:41:24.225 --> 1:41:26.194
Give me my key.

1:41:26.227 --> 1:41:27.195
Dad.

1:41:27.228 --> 1:41:28.996
Crawl back to God.

1:41:29.030 --> 1:41:30.064
I can't help you anymore.

1:41:30.097 --> 1:41:30.732
Dad.

1:41:31.633 --> 1:41:33.000
I have no where to go.

1:41:33.034 --> 1:41:34.368
Its not my problem
my key Dayo quick.

1:41:34.403 --> 1:41:36.370
Over a college fraternity.

1:41:36.405 --> 1:41:37.439
My key.

1:41:37.473 --> 1:41:39.475
Did you ever love us?

1:41:50.686 --> 1:41:52.086
I need you out.

1:42:58.854 --> 1:43:00.321
You wanna hit?

1:43:01.322 --> 1:43:02.624
Damn really nigga.

1:43:02.658 --> 1:43:04.593
You on that fuck
it shit now huh?

1:43:11.198 --> 1:43:12.300
To be honest bro.

1:43:12.333 --> 1:43:14.135
I don't understand Christianity.

1:43:14.168 --> 1:43:17.305
We black folks
swear by that shit.

1:43:17.338 --> 1:43:20.442
I feel like all he
does is control us.

1:43:20.475 --> 1:43:21.610
The worst thing that
happened to black people

1:43:21.643 --> 1:43:22.544
wasn't slavery.

1:43:22.578 --> 1:43:24.513
It was Christianity.

1:43:24.546 --> 1:43:26.848
I don't know about that.

1:43:26.882 --> 1:43:28.684
Don't get me wrong.

1:43:28.717 --> 1:43:31.319
The word is pure, but
when people start using it

1:43:31.352 --> 1:43:33.321
to fucking self-serve.

1:43:33.354 --> 1:43:35.524
That's where it gets fucked up.

1:43:35.557 --> 1:43:37.224
I got you believing in
all this dogma shit just

1:43:37.258 --> 1:43:38.727
to control us.

1:43:38.760 --> 1:43:42.330
And then when you don't
listen, you get sent to hell,

1:43:42.363 --> 1:43:45.266
Same thing fraternities do.

1:43:45.299 --> 1:43:49.136
They beat us while I
calling us brothers

1:43:49.170 --> 1:43:53.374
I mean we take it because
it gets us what we want

1:43:56.243 --> 1:43:57.579
I can see that.

1:44:02.618 --> 1:44:05.787
I mean at the end of the day,

1:44:05.821 --> 1:44:09.491
people believe what
serves them the most.

1:44:09.524 --> 1:44:12.226
You can't blame them for it.

1:44:12.259 --> 1:44:13.562
It is what it is.

1:44:24.840 --> 1:44:26.675
So what you gonna do?

1:44:26.708 --> 1:44:27.643
Gonna drop?

1:44:53.502 --> 1:44:55.537
Good morning, pastor.

1:44:55.570 --> 1:44:57.806
Mrs Deborah, how are you?

1:45:00.374 --> 1:45:01.777
Doing well sir.

1:45:07.549 --> 1:45:09.551
Still no Dayo today sir.

1:45:13.354 --> 1:45:15.189
Manage without him.

1:45:23.632 --> 1:45:25.934
All due respect, sir.

1:45:25.967 --> 1:45:27.903
What are we doing here?

1:45:29.805 --> 1:45:33.340
I remember you taught
me that this church

1:45:34.042 --> 1:45:36.310
was about helping others.

1:45:39.014 --> 1:45:42.617
Not about forcing them
to do what we want.

1:46:45.346 --> 1:46:47.415
Hello Dayo how are you?

1:46:50.952 --> 1:46:53.354
Hello can you hear me Dayo?

1:46:57.592 --> 1:47:02.430
I think we have a bad
connection call me back okay?

1:47:02.464 --> 1:47:03.465
Its me.

1:47:08.937 --> 1:47:09.805
Julius,

1:47:11.873 --> 1:47:13.708
Is everything okay?

1:47:14.976 --> 1:47:16.077
Is Dayo okay?

1:47:19.380 --> 1:47:20.048
He is...

1:47:25.387 --> 1:47:27.055
What are you saying?

1:47:31.927 --> 1:47:34.095
Will you pray with me?

1:47:34.129 --> 1:47:36.998
Pray for what
Julius is he okay?

1:47:43.738 --> 1:47:44.606
Julius?

1:47:45.473 --> 1:47:46.474
He's okay.

1:47:49.477 --> 1:47:51.947
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

1:47:57.485 --> 1:48:00.555
Dear Lord we confess
our sins to you.

1:48:08.496 --> 1:48:11.867
Forgive us God wash
all our problems away

1:48:17.205 --> 1:48:22.010
we know true help and healing
can only be found in you

1:48:22.043 --> 1:48:23.411
Julius?

1:48:23.445 --> 1:48:24.613
For you are the one

1:48:24.646 --> 1:48:27.048
Julius, stop. Listen,

1:48:37.692 --> 1:48:40.495
Just be there
