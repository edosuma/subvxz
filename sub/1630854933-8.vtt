WEBVTT

00:02.235 --> 00:03.803
And if elected mayor,
the first thing

00:03.803 --> 00:07.941
you've committed to doing
is "cutting the fat--"

00:07.941 --> 00:09.542
"--the useless kind,

00:09.542 --> 00:11.878
not the tasty kind."

00:11.878 --> 00:14.280
I'm going to slash funds,
privatize and close institutions

00:14.280 --> 00:17.951
that are a waste of money,
starting with the libraries.

00:17.951 --> 00:20.320
- Well, some would argue that--
- Look, sweetie.

00:20.320 --> 00:21.888
Let me give you
a Patt-truth.

00:21.888 --> 00:24.424
I went to a
library recently,

00:24.424 --> 00:28.228
and the branch manager
cracked a sex whip at me.

00:28.228 --> 00:29.396
A sex whip!

00:29.396 --> 00:31.164
Why are we wasting
good money

00:31.164 --> 00:33.466
on moldy buildings
filled with old books?

00:33.466 --> 00:34.834
Am I right?

00:34.834 --> 00:36.770
- Is he serious?
- Oh, he's controversial.

00:36.770 --> 00:39.072
- This is good stuff.
- Controversial?

00:39.072 --> 00:40.840
Butter on a pop tart
is controversial.

00:40.840 --> 00:42.809
- This man sounds insane.
- Oh, relax.

00:42.809 --> 00:44.477
He's not actually going
to cut libraries,

00:44.477 --> 00:47.180
but his idea to cut gas
taxes? Mm. Inspired.

00:47.180 --> 00:48.982
Such disrespect.
Okay. No.

00:48.982 --> 00:51.117
Libraries, they're-- they're
a stalwart of society,

00:51.117 --> 00:53.119
the-- the backbone
of civilization.

00:53.119 --> 00:56.790
They are a place
for brave truth-seekers.

00:56.790 --> 00:59.125
Everybody love libraries.
And librarians.

00:59.125 --> 01:00.960
- Exactly. They need us.
- Yes.

01:00.960 --> 01:03.696
Hey, when are y'all going to
get self-check-in here

01:03.696 --> 01:06.266
so we don't have to wait for you
to finish your Snap-Tok?

01:14.007 --> 01:16.543
His rant on revising
the sex ed curriculum in school

01:16.543 --> 01:17.877
- is solid.
- Yeah. Okay.

01:17.877 --> 01:19.779
- Smart.
- Yeah. Solid insanity!

01:19.779 --> 01:21.948
Patton Jefferson wants to
eliminate your place of work,

01:21.948 --> 01:24.284
Bryce! I don't want to
lose my job here!

01:24.284 --> 01:26.653
I'd rather any of the other
seven left-leaning candidates

01:26.653 --> 01:27.954
become mayor.

01:27.954 --> 01:29.456
They couldn't form one
solid platform!

01:29.456 --> 01:30.957
Okay! That's what
your go-to is?

01:32.559 --> 01:34.828
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it! Stop!

01:34.828 --> 01:36.629
You both know that you're
not supposed to sway

01:36.629 --> 01:39.833
the people in
line!

01:39.833 --> 01:42.135
Now, represent the library
and hand these out.

01:42.135 --> 01:44.504
Wendy, did you spend
all night baking?

01:44.504 --> 01:46.539
Girl, I don't
have time to be baking.

01:46.539 --> 01:48.741
I was busy printing
inspirational book quotes

01:48.741 --> 01:50.477
to put on
these water bottles.

01:50.477 --> 01:51.511
Hand those out, too.

01:52.745 --> 01:55.181
Just a friendly
reminder, everyone,

01:55.181 --> 01:58.051
that Jameson Library will be
closed for four weeks

01:58.051 --> 02:00.520
for some long-overdue
renovations!

02:00.520 --> 02:02.322
Way to go, Jameson.

02:02.322 --> 02:04.390
Wendy!
You're voting!

02:04.390 --> 02:06.526
- Never have, never will.
- Oh.

02:06.526 --> 02:08.328
Just here for
the refreshments.

02:09.762 --> 02:11.097
Here you go. Two
patties and--

02:11.097 --> 02:13.199
And two
sorrel drinks.

02:13.199 --> 02:14.934
Thank you for cutting
our study session short

02:14.934 --> 02:17.737
so you could help out today.
I had no idea we'd be this busy.

02:17.737 --> 02:21.241
Hey, it's my pleasure.
Uh, fortiores unita.

02:21.241 --> 02:23.243
It means "we are
stronger together."

02:23.243 --> 02:24.944
You're such
a nerd, Howard.

02:24.944 --> 02:26.746
And hey,
to thank you,

02:26.746 --> 02:30.416
let me treat you to a fancy
coffee at a real coffee place.

02:30.416 --> 02:32.218
"Real coffee place"?

02:32.218 --> 02:33.386
You're twice
as bad as One-Rude.

02:33.386 --> 02:35.522
You're Too-Rude.

02:35.522 --> 02:37.724
- Oh, thanks for filling in, eh?
- Ah, it's alright.

02:37.724 --> 02:40.527
I love helping Sheila--
uh, uh, Deena--

02:40.527 --> 02:42.028
the cafÃ©.

02:42.028 --> 02:44.564
Mm-hmm. You're
very helpful, huh?

02:44.564 --> 02:46.566
Helping my
daughter study,

02:46.566 --> 02:48.067
helping her work here,

02:48.067 --> 02:50.637
helping her at the
Settlement Desk.

02:50.637 --> 02:53.740
Don't engage, Howard. That
way lies madness.

02:53.740 --> 02:55.241
Oh.

02:55.241 --> 02:57.377
Woman on phone:
Wendy, I hate

02:57.377 --> 02:59.412
to be the bearer
of bad news, but--

02:59.412 --> 03:01.414
Oh. No, Loretta.
Please don't say it.

03:01.414 --> 03:03.283
Woman on phone: The renovations
that were just approved

03:03.283 --> 03:05.485
are contingent on
the election outcome.

03:05.485 --> 03:07.120
Oh, wait. So
they're still on?

03:07.120 --> 03:09.222
Well, for
now. It all depends.

03:09.222 --> 03:10.957
If Patton
Jefferson wins,

03:10.957 --> 03:12.559
then we can't
release the funds,

03:12.559 --> 03:14.727
and we have to hold on
to them until we get

03:14.727 --> 03:17.230
the next budget and we know
where he's going to spend it.

03:17.230 --> 03:19.165
And I just-- I just wanted

03:19.165 --> 03:21.834
to mentally and emotionally
prepare you for this.

03:21.834 --> 03:25.672
Loretta, the lobby is filled
with voting Parkdale-ians.

03:25.672 --> 03:28.007
The last few weeks, we've
offered info sessions

03:28.007 --> 03:31.477
on key issues, on how
to register, on how to vote.

03:31.477 --> 03:33.846
I have faith that
the right person will win.

03:33.846 --> 03:35.682
I knew you'd
say that, Wendy.

03:35.682 --> 03:39.452
And I really, really
hope that you're right.

03:39.452 --> 03:43.289
No. No. No. No. Wendy,
please do not stress-eat

03:43.289 --> 03:45.191
your weird pastries
in front of me.

03:51.297 --> 03:53.866
"How I Became a
YA Author"?

03:53.866 --> 03:55.835
Lurk much, Alvin?

03:55.835 --> 03:58.171
- Jacqueline, you're a writer!
- No! Stop. Shut up. Goodbye.

03:58.171 --> 03:59.772
Do you want my help?
That's what I do.

03:59.772 --> 04:01.708
I help people become better
versions of themselves.

04:01.708 --> 04:03.376
Gross. Why do you
care all of a sudden?

04:03.376 --> 04:04.978
Because I am on a
helping high.

04:04.978 --> 04:06.779
I helped Tenzin K with
his grant proposal,

04:06.779 --> 04:08.648
I helped Tenzin D with his
work-from-home budget,

04:08.648 --> 04:11.217
and I helped Tenzin G
with their business plan,

04:11.217 --> 04:12.952
because I am that good. I'm
on fire right now.

04:12.952 --> 04:14.687
Okay. Can you be
on fire somewhere else?

04:14.687 --> 04:16.789
Okay. Look. Look. I can give you
a professional consultation.

04:16.789 --> 04:18.625
I have helped so many clients

04:18.625 --> 04:20.326
apply for Indigenous
artists' grants.

04:20.326 --> 04:22.328
I can make a call,
some proposals.

04:22.328 --> 04:23.963
I-- I don't know.
Just ask me.

04:23.963 --> 04:25.665
I don't have the time
to explain to you the irony

04:25.665 --> 04:27.500
of helping a writer write
a grant for writing.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.502
I have a handle on my
career. Thank you.

04:29.502 --> 04:30.536
Okay.

04:34.140 --> 04:36.242
- So, you have the tickets?
- Man on phone: You asked me

04:36.242 --> 04:37.710
to put aside two. I
put aside two.

04:37.710 --> 04:40.346
Mm!
- So, um, you going to ask her?

04:40.346 --> 04:41.648
Hope it works out.

04:41.648 --> 04:43.149
We've just been
vibe-ing all week.

04:43.149 --> 04:45.084
I mean, she's so
smart and funny and--

04:45.084 --> 04:46.753
Wait. Hold on.
Why would you say that?

04:46.753 --> 04:48.655
I mean,
you know, Isla?

04:48.655 --> 04:51.057
So, if things blow up again,

04:51.057 --> 04:52.892
there's no going lower than
Jameson Library.

04:52.892 --> 04:54.861
But I got your
back, bro.

04:54.861 --> 04:57.497
Come work here! We got
great pay, benefits.

04:57.497 --> 05:00.867
And baked goods alert: the
morning muffins are to die for.

05:00.867 --> 05:02.602
Alright. Alright. Thanks, Dane.
Thank you very much.

05:02.602 --> 05:03.903
But you know what? I
happened to have

05:03.903 --> 05:05.872
a very good feeling
about this.

05:05.872 --> 05:08.374
Oh, jeez. You
chose to say that, huh?

05:08.374 --> 05:09.876
May the force be
with you!

05:11.277 --> 05:12.879
- Sheila.
- Mm-hmm?

05:12.879 --> 05:15.348
Did you know that the Kore is
widely considered to be

05:15.348 --> 05:17.250
one of the most
significant sculptures

05:17.250 --> 05:18.851
from the Acropolis
in Athens?

05:18.851 --> 05:21.721
No, I didn't, but now, I
can answer that witch's riddle.

05:21.721 --> 05:23.256
Why are you telling me?

05:23.256 --> 05:26.125
There happens to be
an exhibit at the museum.

05:26.125 --> 05:27.393
Would you like
to come with me?

05:28.528 --> 05:29.729
Oh. Um...

05:31.130 --> 05:32.532
Like-- like a date?

05:32.532 --> 05:33.933
Well, yes.

05:33.933 --> 05:35.301
If that's okay.

05:36.803 --> 05:38.805
Um...

05:38.805 --> 05:41.407
Howard, I'm
really flattered,

05:41.407 --> 05:44.877
but I'm not really in the
dating space, uh, right now.

05:48.214 --> 05:51.150
Uh, totally. Yeah. No.
Um, yeah. For sure.

05:51.150 --> 05:52.952
And I'm just going to get
back to work, you know?

05:52.952 --> 05:54.754
- It's all good. Later, skater.
- Oh, that's

05:54.754 --> 05:56.789
- for the Settlement--
- Oh, that's not mine.

05:59.726 --> 06:01.294
It'll help. It'll help.
They're announcing it.

06:01.294 --> 06:03.129
They're announcing it!
They're announcing it! Okay.

06:03.129 --> 06:04.597
Toronto,
votes have been counted,

06:04.597 --> 06:06.733
and you have elected
your new mayor...

06:07.800 --> 06:09.268
Patton Jefferson!

06:09.268 --> 06:11.270
Yeah!
No!

06:11.270 --> 06:12.839
- Are you serious?
- What?

06:12.839 --> 06:14.107
No, no, no.
Look at the numbers.

06:14.107 --> 06:15.575
He only won with
30 percent of the vote?

06:15.575 --> 06:17.110
Ugh, Patton
Jefferson's the worst!

06:17.110 --> 06:18.111
Hard disagree.

06:18.111 --> 06:20.146
Our renovations.

06:20.146 --> 06:22.014
Wendy, you okay?

06:22.014 --> 06:23.516
- I'm fine.
- You sure?

06:23.516 --> 06:27.587
It's fine. Everything's...
everything's fine.

06:27.587 --> 06:29.021
I'm fine. It's good. Thirty

06:29.021 --> 06:30.957
percent of the vote is
100 percent of the vote.

06:32.625 --> 06:35.528
Mother [bleep]!

06:35.528 --> 06:37.163
Ooh.

06:37.163 --> 06:38.197
Language.

06:42.168 --> 06:43.169
Hey.

06:46.773 --> 06:49.175
Forrest, uh, did I
just hear your stomach?

06:49.175 --> 06:51.177
Yeah. My dad's working
a double shift

06:51.177 --> 06:53.446
at the restaurant today,
so I have to stay here

06:53.446 --> 06:55.681
- a little longer.
- Well, here. Uh...

06:57.483 --> 07:00.486
Why don't you take my
afternoon snack while you wait?

07:00.486 --> 07:02.121
How's the book?

07:02.121 --> 07:04.056
Good. I should be
meeting the lion soon.

07:04.056 --> 07:06.559
Oh, that is a
terrific chapter.

07:06.559 --> 07:08.227
You're so lucky to be reading
this for the first time

07:08.227 --> 07:10.229
right now. Ah, wow.

07:12.698 --> 07:15.835
Uh, Deena. What are you,
uh, doing here?

07:15.835 --> 07:17.503
I know you like
my daughter.

07:17.503 --> 07:19.505
Sheila? Well, sure. I mean,
don't we all?

07:19.505 --> 07:20.540
I mean, I just--
you know--

07:20.540 --> 07:22.708
You're alright. Helpful.

07:22.708 --> 07:25.044
Even though you talk
like a scientist.

07:25.044 --> 07:27.046
But you should know,

07:27.046 --> 07:30.316
Sheila is getting back
together with her ex-husband.

07:30.316 --> 07:31.484
- With Adonis?
- Mm.

07:33.152 --> 07:34.987
That's what she
meant. Okay.

07:34.987 --> 07:36.989
Well, I mean, that's
obviously great for Sheila,

07:36.989 --> 07:38.825
you know, who's free
to make her own choices

07:38.825 --> 07:42.395
however she so chooses,
in a choicely manner.

07:42.395 --> 07:45.164
Okay. Yes. I'm starting
to hear that scientist thing.

07:45.164 --> 07:47.433
Good to see
you. Alright, Howie.

07:47.433 --> 07:48.501
Ah.

07:50.837 --> 07:52.438
And I thought we were
vibe-ing. I don't know.

07:52.438 --> 07:54.207
I guess she was on an
entirely different page,

07:54.207 --> 07:56.609
and that page was "I guess I'll
get back together with my ex

07:56.609 --> 07:58.010
and not tell Howard" page.

07:58.010 --> 07:59.712
Mm. Well, I
saw Adonis's photo,

07:59.712 --> 08:01.514
and you sure his
name isn't Hadrian?

08:01.514 --> 08:03.716
Because dude is
built like a wall.

08:03.716 --> 08:05.718
- So, what are you going to do?
- I don't know.

08:05.718 --> 08:08.387
I keep thinking, "What
am I doing here?"

08:08.387 --> 08:09.789
We're on the brink of
losing our funding,

08:09.789 --> 08:11.591
and where is my
career going exactly?

08:11.591 --> 08:13.192
Plus I made
a fool of myself

08:13.192 --> 08:14.861
in front of the woman that
I most respect.

08:14.861 --> 08:17.897
I warned you. This is
Isla all over again.

08:17.897 --> 08:20.032
- You're just repeating--
- You know what? I'll take it.

08:20.032 --> 08:22.401
The archival job you offered
me, is it still available?

08:22.401 --> 08:25.104
Hells yeah! Oh, you are going
to love working here, dude.

08:25.104 --> 08:26.739
No chance of
awkward crushes.

08:26.739 --> 08:28.207
Everyone here
is an uggo.

08:28.207 --> 08:31.577
Okay. Weird sell, but
yeah, you sold me.

08:31.577 --> 08:33.746
- When can I start?
- You can start next week.

08:33.746 --> 08:36.048
Thanks. I
really appreciate this.

08:50.062 --> 08:52.565
Bryce, Jaq: Wendy! Wendy!

08:52.565 --> 08:54.300
No. No. No. No.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.168
Can you tell Jaq to stop
following me around

08:56.168 --> 08:57.603
shouting, "Overthrow
the Patt-riots"?

08:57.603 --> 08:59.005
It's scaring the
Patt-ri-- the patrons.

08:59.005 --> 09:00.239
Yeah. Okay. Wendy,
can you write Bryce up

09:00.239 --> 09:01.641
for being an
absolute idiot?

09:01.641 --> 09:03.142
And can you and I
have a moment to talk?

09:03.142 --> 09:04.410
I have an announcement.

09:04.410 --> 09:06.612
No.

09:06.612 --> 09:07.613
Sorry. What? What?
Huh?

09:07.613 --> 09:09.081
Howard, Bryce:
No?

09:09.081 --> 09:12.985
No, because I have
an announcement to make.

09:12.985 --> 09:14.320
I am heading
to home office

09:14.320 --> 09:16.989
to get Jameson
the funding it needs.

09:16.989 --> 09:18.858
Bryce, you're in charge. Don't
annoy Jaq too much.

09:18.858 --> 09:20.092
Jaq, stop yelling things
at Bryce.

09:20.092 --> 09:21.994
Howard, our talk
will have to wait.

09:21.994 --> 09:26.666
I will be back with the money
this library sorely needs!

09:28.768 --> 09:30.870
What the fish
was that?

09:30.870 --> 09:32.705
That was the return
of Fierce Wendy.

09:32.705 --> 09:34.373
- Nice.
- Yeah.

09:34.373 --> 09:37.343
Hey, Big Library, what's
your announcement?

09:37.343 --> 09:38.377
Um...

09:39.812 --> 09:42.481
Patty and a cocoa bread
and a ginger beer.

09:42.481 --> 09:44.150
- Ah.
- This is what you order

09:44.150 --> 09:45.952
when you're stressed.
Are you stressed, Bryce?

09:45.952 --> 09:48.487
Yeah. Well, between you and me,
I may have voted for somebody

09:48.487 --> 09:50.990
who might lay me off. Only
cool thing about today

09:50.990 --> 09:53.326
is Howard announcing he's
leaving for a new job.

09:53.326 --> 09:54.961
What did you say
about Howard?

09:54.961 --> 09:57.630
Yeah. Yeah. Big Library
is finally taking

09:57.630 --> 10:00.967
his annoying pomposity
to the museum.

10:00.967 --> 10:02.168
Thanks for
the patty, Deena.

10:04.303 --> 10:06.572
Wow. Howard didn't
tell me he was leaving.

10:06.572 --> 10:08.674
I mean, I'm happy for him.
Museum's a perfect fit for him.

10:08.674 --> 10:10.176
Well, I didn't think
he'd leave after--

10:10.176 --> 10:12.545
Well, that's good.
Big things for Mr. Howie.

10:12.545 --> 10:14.180
I got to go clean
these tables. Excuse.

10:14.180 --> 10:16.849
Old lady, what
did you do?

10:16.849 --> 10:17.883
Nothing.

10:20.186 --> 10:21.721
I may have told Howard

10:21.721 --> 10:23.556
that you and Adonis
are getting back together.

10:23.556 --> 10:25.424
- What? Mom!
- It was a test.

10:25.424 --> 10:27.593
I was testing him.
See what he's made of.

10:27.593 --> 10:29.061
I do that to all
the boys you like.

10:29.061 --> 10:31.063
Mom, Howard and I are
just friends, okay?

10:31.063 --> 10:32.198
He helps me study.

10:32.198 --> 10:34.567
Study? Ha! Pfft.

10:34.567 --> 10:36.669
You're studying something,
but it's not books.

10:36.669 --> 10:37.703
Flirty-flirty.

10:43.242 --> 10:45.511
Jaq, what's up?

10:48.581 --> 10:50.916
- Howard just quit.
- Oh. He did.

10:50.916 --> 10:52.752
Yeah, and that kind of
sucks, because he was really

10:52.752 --> 10:54.353
starting to grow on
me, but it got me thinking

10:54.353 --> 10:56.355
- about my own future.
- And you're here to talk

10:56.355 --> 10:58.758
about new career
options. I knew it.

11:01.293 --> 11:03.562
I have a degree in journalism,
and I was accepted

11:03.562 --> 11:05.631
into the best law schools
in the country, but I didn't go,

11:05.631 --> 11:07.400
because what I really
want to do is write

11:07.400 --> 11:09.602
- and-- and be a fiction author.
- Oh.

11:09.602 --> 11:13.472
But I can't afford to
not work so I can write, so--

11:13.472 --> 11:15.541
Okay. You can apply for
these writing grants.

11:15.541 --> 11:17.810
That way, you can get the
funding to apply for your books,

11:17.810 --> 11:19.945
short stories, TikTok essays.

11:19.945 --> 11:21.580
- These are the grants?
- No, no.

11:21.580 --> 11:24.917
Those are just the instructions
to fill out the grants.

11:24.917 --> 11:28.320
No. No. No. No.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.589
And if you mention this to
anyone, I will end you.

11:33.292 --> 11:37.430
Patton! Patton!
Patton! Patton! Patton!

11:37.430 --> 11:41.667
Patton! Patton! Patton! Patton!

11:45.604 --> 11:46.972
Patton Jefferson!

11:46.972 --> 11:48.441
- Patton Jefferson!
- Yes.

11:48.441 --> 11:50.176
First of all,
congratulations on your win.

11:50.176 --> 11:53.579
It is not ideal, but that is
our fair election process.

11:53.579 --> 11:56.415
And secondly, you're wrong
about library funding.

11:56.415 --> 11:57.850
As a branch head--
Oh!

11:57.850 --> 12:00.686
You're the sex whip lady
from Jameson Library!

12:02.788 --> 12:07.359
You have no idea how hard my
staff at Jameson works.

12:07.359 --> 12:09.762
A ridiculous amount of our
budget goes to duct tape

12:09.762 --> 12:13.165
because we're constantly
taping up books and DVD covers

12:13.165 --> 12:15.601
and shelves and
even ceiling tiles!

12:15.601 --> 12:17.803
We are there for
the people that need us,

12:17.803 --> 12:20.539
and you need to
do right by them.

12:20.539 --> 12:21.640
Sorry. Couldn't
hear you.

12:21.640 --> 12:22.641
It's a little
loud here.

12:22.641 --> 12:24.844
Yeah!

12:24.844 --> 12:27.646
Patton Jefferson, you
have zero understanding

12:27.646 --> 12:28.948
of how public services work!

12:28.948 --> 12:31.317
You are nothing
but a basic bully!

12:31.317 --> 12:33.018
Oh.

12:34.820 --> 12:36.455
Look. I get it.

12:36.455 --> 12:39.458
It's hard to let go of
antiquated institutions,

12:39.458 --> 12:42.628
but this is the
future of Toronto.

12:42.628 --> 12:43.996
Also, I never
really understood

12:43.996 --> 12:46.365
the whole sexy
librarian thing.

12:46.365 --> 12:47.733
Sure don't
see it here.

12:50.002 --> 12:52.304
Maybe it would help if
you smiled more.

12:52.304 --> 12:53.305
Ah!

12:54.840 --> 12:56.308
Ooh.

12:56.308 --> 12:59.645
You will face
Patt-unishment for that.

12:59.645 --> 13:00.746
- You got that, right?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

13:07.253 --> 13:08.621
Ugh.
I don't know.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.156
It's not that bad.
I probably would have

13:10.156 --> 13:11.390
- punched him in the face.
- Right. Yeah.

13:11.390 --> 13:12.992
Jefferson clearly
goaded you.

13:12.992 --> 13:16.095
I don't know
what got into me.

13:16.095 --> 13:18.731
With that outburst, I
will definitely be fired.

13:18.731 --> 13:21.333
It's best that I
have my things ready

13:21.333 --> 13:23.135
when they tell me I
need to leave.

13:27.173 --> 13:28.507
Oh, Bryce,

13:28.507 --> 13:30.075
take care
of Jameson,

13:30.075 --> 13:31.677
as you're next
in line for manager.

13:33.913 --> 13:36.482
Oh. Wendy, Wendy,

13:36.482 --> 13:38.984
the-- the book-throwing was
uncharacteristic for you,

13:38.984 --> 13:41.253
but I respect it. You hired me
straight out of the pen,

13:41.253 --> 13:42.755
and I will always be
grateful for that.

13:42.755 --> 13:46.859
And I am willing to step
up if and when needed.

13:46.859 --> 13:48.093
It's not needed.

13:48.093 --> 13:50.129
Well, she
asked me, okay?

13:50.129 --> 13:54.033
Jameson and Toronto and
I are going through changes.

13:54.033 --> 13:56.202
It was bound
to happen.

13:56.202 --> 13:59.438
Speaking of changes, I got
your resignation letter.

13:59.438 --> 14:01.207
Are you sure
you want to move on?

14:01.207 --> 14:03.709
Yeah. I got to think
about my future.

14:03.709 --> 14:08.214
Okay. And so,
we must all succumb

14:08.214 --> 14:09.849
to the changing
of the tides.

14:11.283 --> 14:12.685
Yeah.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.620
- Wendy.
- Loretta, I know

14:14.620 --> 14:15.821
why you're here.

14:15.821 --> 14:18.691
I saw your bonkers
meltdown online.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.827
- I know. I'm fired.
- No. I'm here because--

14:21.827 --> 14:23.662
Well, have you seen
who's in your library?

14:24.730 --> 14:27.366
- What?
- Mm. Come have a look.

14:27.366 --> 14:30.336
Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!

14:35.207 --> 14:37.343
What is this?
- Unhoused Wendy: Wendy!

14:37.343 --> 14:40.312
Wendy! That was
a terrible throw,

14:40.312 --> 14:43.148
but I am so
proud of you!

14:50.089 --> 14:52.324
Wendy, when
that video went viral,

14:52.324 --> 14:55.694
you tapped into a vein of
people who feel the way you do.

14:55.694 --> 14:58.063
There are hundreds
of posts.

14:58.063 --> 15:00.933
Yeah. Read this. "One
day, it was pouring rain.

15:00.933 --> 15:02.902
I had a fight with my boyfriend,
and I ran into Jameson.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.703
The branch head gave me a
free umbrella and picked out

15:04.703 --> 15:06.205
a book for me that I
couldn't put down.

15:06.205 --> 15:07.873
It helped me break up
with my boyfriend.

15:07.873 --> 15:09.675
I never asked her name,
but this book-throwing,

15:09.675 --> 15:11.510
- passionate woman is her."
- Oh.

15:11.510 --> 15:16.015
Oh. (laughing) I thought
I was getting fired.

15:16.015 --> 15:18.350
Oh, Steve did send
me here to fire you.

15:18.350 --> 15:20.252
- Oh.
- But then all of those people

15:20.252 --> 15:22.421
started sharing those stories.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.590
There's no way home
office is going to fire

15:24.590 --> 15:27.927
the beloved librarian
who stood up for her library.

15:30.729 --> 15:32.698
Also, I'm not dealing with
angry DMs. So, no thank you.

15:34.033 --> 15:36.201
Thank you so
much, Jameson.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.976
Wendy, can I have a chat
with you for a sec?

15:43.976 --> 15:45.110
Yeah, of course.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.079
Come on.
Quick. Quick.

15:47.079 --> 15:49.448
I just have some good news
about the renovation.

15:49.448 --> 15:52.084
- Oh.
- Jameson will be getting them.

15:52.084 --> 15:54.453
The higher-ups are working
really hard trying to approve

15:54.453 --> 15:56.789
all of the renovations
before Jefferson's in office

15:56.789 --> 16:00.125
cutting funding, but we need to
stick together right now

16:00.125 --> 16:01.727
while there's a bigger threat
to worry about.

16:01.727 --> 16:05.331
Oh, Loretta. I have
waited so long for this.

16:05.331 --> 16:09.335
Ooh. Well, there's-- there's
strings. But-- One string.

16:09.335 --> 16:11.303
Okay. I'm listening.

16:14.139 --> 16:16.075
Mr. Howard, Mr. Howard.

16:16.075 --> 16:18.177
From my dad. It's cookies
from his restaurant.

16:18.177 --> 16:20.479
- He says thanks.
- Thanks so much, Forrest.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.414
Oh, and I met the
lion. You were right.

16:22.414 --> 16:24.984
It's such a cool chapter.
Bye, Mr. Howard!

16:24.984 --> 16:26.118
Bye, Forrest.

16:30.923 --> 16:33.025
Beautiful mess.

16:37.796 --> 16:38.764
Damn it.

16:42.034 --> 16:44.937
Howard, look what
I got made for you.

16:44.937 --> 16:46.171
Oh, wow.

16:46.171 --> 16:49.208
Uh, listen, Dane.
Um, look, man.

16:49.208 --> 16:51.777
I've reconsidered. I
can't leave the library.

16:51.777 --> 16:54.213
This place is odd,
but there's something here.

16:54.213 --> 16:56.715
- Is it Sheila?
- Uh, no.

16:56.715 --> 17:00.219
Actually, it's not about her,
believe it or not.

17:00.219 --> 17:02.788
I just feel like
I need to be here.

17:02.788 --> 17:04.123
I'm making a
difference, you know?

17:04.123 --> 17:06.859
No, I don't know.

17:06.859 --> 17:11.330
I have been asking you to come
here to work with me for a year,

17:11.330 --> 17:12.531
and you finally
said yes,

17:12.531 --> 17:14.500
so I fired the
kid I hired,

17:14.500 --> 17:17.736
who happens to be the son of
the program director.

17:17.736 --> 17:19.905
- What. He was what?
- Oh, God.

17:19.905 --> 17:22.307
This year's holiday party is
going to be so awkward.

17:22.307 --> 17:23.509
How could you do
this to me, Howard?

17:23.509 --> 17:25.244
Believe me, I
had no intention

17:25.244 --> 17:26.545
of having things
turn out this way.

17:26.545 --> 17:28.147
Oh, I hope
you're happy,

17:28.147 --> 17:30.149
because not only did you
lose a dope job.

17:30.149 --> 17:31.717
You lost a
dope friend.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.318
And access
to this museum!

17:33.318 --> 17:36.188
Consider yourself
banned! Indefinitely!

17:38.390 --> 17:40.392
Dane, come on.
You can't bend metal.

17:40.392 --> 17:44.596
Yes, I can. I have
special museum powers.

17:44.596 --> 17:46.432
I got to go.

18:06.351 --> 18:08.287
Wendy.

18:08.287 --> 18:12.291
I shall see m'lovelies
in four weeks.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.726
- Enjoy your time off.
- Well-deserved, Wendy Armuth.

18:14.726 --> 18:17.229
I'll be dynamiting invasive
species up in Cochrane

18:17.229 --> 18:18.964
- for my break.
- That's great, Bryce.

18:20.132 --> 18:21.800
Oh. Oh, jeez.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.402
What are you
going to do up there?

18:23.402 --> 18:26.472
Contemplate being branch manager
for a whole two seconds?

18:26.472 --> 18:28.474
- Jaq, Wendy: Oh.
- Hey, Wendy, make sure

18:28.474 --> 18:30.075
you take of
yourself, too, okay?

18:30.075 --> 18:32.444
You're a local hero
now, blowing up the socials!

18:32.444 --> 18:34.646
Mm!

18:34.646 --> 18:36.815
Ah, tut-tut-tut.
I consent to a hug.

18:40.085 --> 18:41.620
I'm happy you
decided to stay.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.589
Me, too. See you in
a few weeks.

18:47.826 --> 18:48.961
Well, get
out of here.

18:50.562 --> 18:52.231
I really look
forward to being your boss.

18:52.231 --> 18:53.298
My bag.
There's definitely

18:53.298 --> 18:55.167
a few things
I can teach you.

18:55.167 --> 18:57.769
Yeah? Like what?

19:10.582 --> 19:11.750
Hey, Howard.

19:11.750 --> 19:14.186
- Sheila.
- I'm glad I caught you.

19:14.186 --> 19:16.588
What my mom said
to you the other day--

19:16.588 --> 19:19.124
she was just
pulling your leg.

19:19.124 --> 19:21.827
I'm sorry.
Pulling my--

19:21.827 --> 19:23.762
Oh, my God. You're
not actually--

19:23.762 --> 19:25.764
I got to hand it to her.

19:25.764 --> 19:29.801
She really had me going. She's
really good. Evil, but good.

19:29.801 --> 19:31.803
- I told you not to engage.
- Huh.

19:31.803 --> 19:34.606
And hey, I heard you're leaving
for a new job. Congrats.

19:34.606 --> 19:37.142
Oh, actually, no. That's
not happening anymore.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.045
I'm staying right here.

19:40.045 --> 19:43.315
Turns out, I've kind of
gotten used to this old place.

19:43.315 --> 19:44.516
And the people.

19:45.951 --> 19:49.454
Oh, good. I mean, you
have no idea

19:49.454 --> 19:52.524
how many witches'
riddles I need to solve.

19:52.524 --> 19:54.793
Well, then, you know, I
guess I'll see you

19:54.793 --> 19:56.361
- at our next study session.
- Oh, actually,

19:56.361 --> 19:58.530
I can finish studying on
my own. Yeah. We always end up,

19:58.530 --> 20:00.832
you know, sharing jokes and
talking about life

20:00.832 --> 20:04.002
and getting off track,
and you, kind sir,

20:04.002 --> 20:05.871
are a distraction.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.739
Oh. Oh.

20:07.739 --> 20:12.077
So, I will see you in four weeks
when the library re-opens.

20:18.717 --> 20:19.851
I'm a distraction.

20:21.553 --> 20:22.888
Alright.

20:25.624 --> 20:27.759
Hey, Wendy, why didn't
you tell your staff your news?

20:30.262 --> 20:31.697
One string.

20:31.697 --> 20:33.365
Okay. I'm listening.

20:33.365 --> 20:35.634
Jameson will only
get the renovations

20:35.634 --> 20:38.804
if you come work at
home office.

20:38.804 --> 20:42.174
You're the new face
of underfunded libraries,

20:42.174 --> 20:46.311
and we need you before Jefferson
gets his hands on our budgets

20:46.311 --> 20:50.949
and starts slashing funding,
or worse, branches.

20:50.949 --> 20:52.150
What do you say?

20:52.150 --> 20:55.120
- Did you get a shirt?
- Smile.

20:55.120 --> 20:56.688
- I want one.
- Why didn't I make the t-shirt?

20:56.688 --> 20:59.491
- Everybody has one.
- Why you didn't make hers?

20:59.491 --> 21:02.194
Jameson finally got
a win today.

21:02.194 --> 21:03.328
Let's let
them have it.

21:07.165 --> 21:09.067
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

21:09.067 --> 21:10.902
Damn it!

21:10.902 --> 21:12.170
- Language.
- Oh.

21:20.512 --> 21:21.546
You happy now?
