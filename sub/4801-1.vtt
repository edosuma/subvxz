00:41.121 --> 00:43.612
Mortal Kombat!

00:51.198 --> 00:54.361
Mortal Kombat
is not about death...

00:54.401 --> 00:57.859
but, rather,
the preservation of life.

00:57.904 --> 01:01.362
Liu Kang and few fighters
from the Earth Realm...

01:01.441 --> 01:04.342
defeated Outworld sorcerer
Shang Tsung.

01:05.479 --> 01:07.208
According to the rules
of Mortal Kombat...

01:07.247 --> 01:12.014
their victory preserved earth's
safety for another generation.

01:12.753 --> 01:15.813
Our chosen ones
were returned to earth...

01:15.856 --> 01:18.324
only to enjoy
a brief period of peace.

01:21.661 --> 01:25.859
For someone from Outworld
has a different point of view.

02:45.445 --> 02:48.278
Shao-Kahn, emperor of Outworld.

02:49.182 --> 02:52.811
The earth
was created in six days...

02:52.853 --> 02:56.550
so shall it be destroyed.

02:57.324 --> 03:03.456
On the seventh day,
mankind will rest in peace!

03:07.334 --> 03:08.858
This is not good.

03:08.902 --> 03:11.632
Somehow he's opened gateways
to your world.

03:11.671 --> 03:14.265
Our Mortal Kombat victory
closed those portals.

03:14.341 --> 03:16.206
What closes can open again.

03:16.276 --> 03:17.766
What does that mean?

03:24.618 --> 03:25.812
Mother.

03:27.821 --> 03:29.049
You're alive.

03:29.089 --> 03:32.650
Too bad you... will die.

03:48.041 --> 03:51.533
As long as I have the power,
you will never rule this world.

03:51.611 --> 03:56.708
As long as the portal is open,
your world becomes mine!

04:16.336 --> 04:18.463
You will never win.

04:49.903 --> 04:51.336
Master.

05:05.285 --> 05:06.809
This ends now!

05:06.853 --> 05:08.718
You hide behind a human?

05:09.255 --> 05:11.655
Why not, Lord Rayden?

05:11.691 --> 05:14.421
You hid behind them
your entire life.

05:17.163 --> 05:18.892
No, Johnny!

05:33.513 --> 05:36.505
Surrender, Rayden, or he dies.

05:38.585 --> 05:40.075
I'll take your generals.

05:40.120 --> 05:43.112
Earth does not bend
to the will of tyrants.

05:43.156 --> 05:47.752
You would never let
one of your humans die.

05:55.935 --> 05:57.835
Trade me for Johnny Cage.

05:57.871 --> 06:01.602
Come bow at my feet.

06:05.779 --> 06:06.939
You fool!

06:25.398 --> 06:30.802
In six days, you will bow to me!

06:32.572 --> 06:34.665
It has begun!

06:58.098 --> 07:00.089
We can't let Kahn get away.

07:00.133 --> 07:01.725
We can't win here.

07:01.768 --> 07:03.827
Annihilate 'em!

07:08.441 --> 07:09.908
We must go.

07:23.223 --> 07:24.417
Move back!

07:30.697 --> 07:32.028
Kahn opened the portal.

07:33.333 --> 07:36.359
Your planet and Outworld
have begun to merge into one.

07:37.237 --> 07:39.102
Think of it as hell on earth.

07:44.144 --> 07:46.510
My mother... resurrected.

07:47.647 --> 07:49.308
How is that possible?

07:49.349 --> 07:52.409
Your mother Sindel
may be the key.

07:52.452 --> 07:54.716
This can't be!
We won the tournament!

07:54.754 --> 07:57.245
The rules say earth is safe
for another generation.

07:57.290 --> 07:59.815
Kahn has broken the rules.

07:59.859 --> 08:03.522
He resurrected Sindel to keep
these portals open indefinitely.

08:03.563 --> 08:07.659
By reuniting you with her,
Kahn's spell will be broken...

08:08.501 --> 08:11.231
your mother's soul
will be at peace...

08:11.271 --> 08:12.829
and his portals closed.

08:12.872 --> 08:14.897
How could the Elder Gods
allow this?

08:14.974 --> 08:16.339
They do not know.

08:16.409 --> 08:19.344
Kahn must be stopped,
or your world will perish.

08:19.379 --> 08:21.813
We have six days
until annihilation.

08:21.848 --> 08:24.817
I beat Shang Tsung.
I can beat Kahn.

08:24.851 --> 08:27.911
You beat a great sorcerer...

08:28.822 --> 08:30.790
but you're no match for Kahn.

08:30.824 --> 08:33.884
If anyone's killing Kahn,
it's me.

08:33.927 --> 08:35.087
Enough!

08:41.067 --> 08:42.659
You are far from ready.

08:42.702 --> 08:47.639
Kahn's extermination squads
will be everywhere, hunting.

08:47.707 --> 08:49.868
I am telling you this
for your own good.

08:49.943 --> 08:52.935
Kahn knows I have no powers
in Outworld.

08:53.012 --> 08:57.176
As the two realms merge,
I will lose my powers on earth.

08:57.217 --> 09:00.584
You must grow stronger,
together.

09:01.487 --> 09:03.421
We are the only hope.

09:11.397 --> 09:14.833
We couldn't even save Johnny.

09:18.838 --> 09:20.499
What do these do?

09:20.540 --> 09:25.000
Inside the velosphere, you can
go anywhere on earth in hours.

09:25.078 --> 09:27.046
The inner winds propel you.

09:28.047 --> 09:31.448
You'll move so fast, it'll be
like you're not moving.

09:34.921 --> 09:36.286
We need your help, Sonya.

09:36.322 --> 09:38.586
I'll take you
to your partner Jax.

09:38.625 --> 09:42.288
Forget it. If I die, fine,
but I'm not losing anybody else.

09:42.328 --> 09:43.693
Alone, you are vulnerable...

09:43.730 --> 09:47.222
but if you work together,
you can do much.

09:47.267 --> 09:48.427
What about us?

09:48.468 --> 09:50.663
You two will travel
to the Hopi mesa.

09:50.703 --> 09:54.503
You did great last time,
but now you need help.

09:54.540 --> 09:56.770
Go deep into the night.

09:56.843 --> 09:59.403
Seek the counsel of Nightwolf.

09:59.479 --> 10:02.277
You will not find him.
He will find you.

10:03.750 --> 10:09.052
I will speak with the Elder Gods
and demand answers.

10:09.088 --> 10:10.885
- Ready?
- Ready.

10:10.924 --> 10:12.152
Here we go.

10:15.595 --> 10:17.825
They are faster than I remember.

10:17.864 --> 10:19.161
I can't wait.

10:29.375 --> 10:30.467
This is amazing.

10:30.543 --> 10:32.408
It's the hot air
from earth's core.

10:32.445 --> 10:33.912
We harness its energy.

10:40.853 --> 10:42.411
Where are we?

10:42.455 --> 10:44.446
The interchange.
Roll to your right.

10:49.662 --> 10:50.993
Hold on to me.

11:47.854 --> 11:50.550
Father, the merger has begun.

11:50.590 --> 11:52.581
Earth is under attack.

11:52.625 --> 11:55.219
It is glorious!

11:55.261 --> 12:00.392
Did you make Rayden beg
before destroying him?

12:09.042 --> 12:11.670
Rayden is of no concern.

12:15.381 --> 12:17.349
You let him live?

12:18.951 --> 12:20.441
He could not be stopped.

12:21.554 --> 12:24.022
I have no use for excuses.

12:24.991 --> 12:28.586
I have broken the sacred rules
to keep the portals open.

12:28.628 --> 12:30.994
If the Elder Gods
learn of our plot...

12:31.030 --> 12:33.897
we shall both
suffer the consequences.

12:33.933 --> 12:35.195
I do not understand.

12:35.234 --> 12:38.226
How can you fear the Elder Gods?

12:38.271 --> 12:41.832
With control of earth,
our power will be absolute.

12:41.908 --> 12:45.036
Until the sixth day
has passed...

12:45.111 --> 12:48.137
we can take no chances
with Rayden and his mortals.

12:50.950 --> 12:54.909
Do not underestimate
the power of the human spirit.

13:31.991 --> 13:35.449
Liu, if anything happens to me...

13:36.028 --> 13:39.987
Kitana, I have lost everything.

13:44.170 --> 13:47.003
I am not going to lose you, too.

16:04.844 --> 16:06.141
The missile!

16:21.093 --> 16:22.287
You must go.

16:22.328 --> 16:23.852
There will be others.

16:25.364 --> 16:26.763
I killed you.

16:29.235 --> 16:30.862
You killed my older brother.

16:32.238 --> 16:33.466
Why did you help us?

16:33.506 --> 16:35.303
I helped her.

16:35.374 --> 16:39.936
Legend says the princess
is the key to stopping Kahn.

16:40.012 --> 16:42.503
You've been following us.
Why?

16:42.581 --> 16:46.449
Kahn reprogrammed Smoke
to come after you...

16:46.485 --> 16:48.783
in order to keep you apart
from Queen Sindel.

16:50.823 --> 16:52.688
How do we get to Nightwolf?

16:52.725 --> 16:55.216
We have a common enemy,
Sub-Zero.

16:55.261 --> 16:59.095
You must help us
if you want to stop Kahn.

17:04.303 --> 17:06.271
Let's hope you succeed.

17:40.606 --> 17:42.437
Get over here!

19:21.607 --> 19:22.904
Take it!

19:26.679 --> 19:28.408
Suckers!

19:36.355 --> 19:37.879
I've got to find Kitana.

19:37.923 --> 19:40.357
Kahn wants you to go after her.

19:40.392 --> 19:41.950
Don't.

19:41.994 --> 19:44.189
Without Kitana, it's over.

19:44.230 --> 19:47.859
You alone are not ready
for what's ahead.

20:14.193 --> 20:18.152
You'll take the same track back
and turn where I showed you.

20:18.197 --> 20:19.892
Don't worry about me.

20:24.203 --> 20:26.262
Is it like this everywhere?

20:27.606 --> 20:30.097
Each hour, the merger
of the realms grows closer.

20:31.810 --> 20:33.903
More of the earth
will be destroyed.

20:39.518 --> 20:42.351
I will meet you
at the temple of the Elder Gods.

20:55.668 --> 20:57.295
Jax!

21:00.472 --> 21:02.599
Thought I was supposed
to be rescuing you.

21:02.675 --> 21:04.438
I couldn't wait.

21:05.411 --> 21:07.902
What have you done
to yourself now?

21:07.980 --> 21:09.948
Cybernetic strength-enhancers.

21:10.015 --> 21:13.451
It quadruples
your muscle capacity.

21:13.519 --> 21:16.215
You've got a confidence problem.

21:20.292 --> 21:24.126
These locks must be
on some remote-access mechanism.

21:24.163 --> 21:25.858
What you doing here?

21:25.898 --> 21:27.331
Everybody split.

21:27.366 --> 21:30.062
The facility will be trashed
by an extermination squad.

21:30.102 --> 21:33.265
What you mean,
extermination squad?

21:33.305 --> 21:36.001
They're trying to kill me,
probably you, too.

21:36.075 --> 21:37.906
I don't even know them.

21:42.047 --> 21:43.275
Damn it!

21:43.315 --> 21:44.942
I can't free you.

21:44.984 --> 21:47.544
Stand back.
Let's see what I'm made of.

21:54.493 --> 21:56.324
That's what I'm talking about.

22:02.935 --> 22:04.766
Wish I had these in high school.

22:04.803 --> 22:06.634
You'll wish
you were in high school.

22:08.240 --> 22:09.366
Hurry!

22:22.688 --> 22:24.588
What is that?

23:08.901 --> 23:11.699
Death is the only way out.

23:11.737 --> 23:16.697
Major Briggs, Sonya Blade...
Shao-Kahn will be pleased.

23:16.775 --> 23:18.072
Shao what?

23:19.545 --> 23:21.137
I'll take homeboy.

23:28.420 --> 23:31.719
I take it this ain't something
we can talk about.

24:13.732 --> 24:15.256
Heads up!

24:32.651 --> 24:34.278
Catch this!

25:02.548 --> 25:04.038
Now what?

25:10.489 --> 25:13.151
Cybernetic strength-enhancers!

25:39.017 --> 25:40.780
Nice look...

25:40.819 --> 25:42.047
but I'd lose the wall.

25:42.087 --> 25:44.351
I was just getting
a feel for it.

25:46.892 --> 25:48.291
Watch out.

26:36.875 --> 26:38.638
You barbecued his ass.

26:40.212 --> 26:41.372
Look at this.

26:56.762 --> 26:58.491
Does this mean what I think?

26:58.530 --> 27:00.521
Too bad I didn't get new legs.

27:27.759 --> 27:31.752
My squads have claimed thousands
of innocent souls on earth.

27:31.797 --> 27:34.095
I will claim millions.

27:34.132 --> 27:37.624
By now, you'd be behind bars
in a zoo.

27:37.669 --> 27:41.400
If those bars kept me away
from you, Sheeva...

27:41.440 --> 27:42.998
I would welcome them!

27:53.552 --> 27:54.780
Silence!

28:00.125 --> 28:01.649
What is your report?

28:01.693 --> 28:04.389
Two of earth's best warriors
have been taken...

28:04.429 --> 28:06.294
Kabaal and Stryker.

28:06.331 --> 28:11.598
Did you make them beg
before you destroyed them?

28:11.636 --> 28:14.196
I thought if I let them live...

28:14.239 --> 28:15.763
I have no use for excuses!

28:24.282 --> 28:30.187
Rain,
this will never happen again.

28:30.222 --> 28:32.656
It will never happen again.

28:39.731 --> 28:42.859
It is true
this will never happen again.

28:43.902 --> 28:46.063
I need a new general.

28:48.273 --> 28:51.731
You can die in duty
or by my hand.

28:51.777 --> 28:53.745
Centaurs are known
for their hunting prowess.

28:53.779 --> 28:57.613
As general, I will personally
hunt down every human soul...

28:57.649 --> 28:59.617
and spare no one!

28:59.651 --> 29:01.209
Motaro can't be trusted.

29:01.253 --> 29:05.019
Long ago, I proved myself
as the protector of Sindel.

29:05.057 --> 29:08.049
Your orders are mine to follow.

29:08.093 --> 29:10.789
The energies they waste
with their sniveling...

29:10.829 --> 29:13.923
I would use to capture souls.

29:15.500 --> 29:18.663
You are all too impetuous
for such important work.

29:20.038 --> 29:25.032
You are my new general,
Queen Sindel...

29:26.511 --> 29:30.345
unless anyone
has a different point of view.

31:14.085 --> 31:15.916
Pretty cool, huh?

31:16.588 --> 31:18.146
It's my animality.

31:18.190 --> 31:20.055
Who are you?

31:20.091 --> 31:21.683
Wouldn't you like to know?

31:22.127 --> 31:24.459
So you're Rayden's prodigy.

31:25.564 --> 31:26.758
I've seen better.

31:27.999 --> 31:29.159
Don't sweat it.

31:29.201 --> 31:31.169
I've seen worse, too.

31:32.737 --> 31:37.197
If you are Nightwolf,
you know I won Mortal Kombat.

31:37.242 --> 31:39.301
Don't get cocky.

31:39.377 --> 31:40.969
The tournament had rules.

31:41.046 --> 31:42.570
This time, anything goes.

31:45.317 --> 31:47.376
It was a mistake coming here.

31:48.453 --> 31:50.114
You think you're ready...

31:50.155 --> 31:52.680
but if you were,
would Kitana have been captured?

31:57.229 --> 31:58.821
Can you help me get her back?

32:00.932 --> 32:02.092
Maybe.

32:02.133 --> 32:03.725
Kitana is important.

32:03.768 --> 32:06.498
To beat Shao-Kahn,
you've got to pass three tests.

32:07.205 --> 32:08.672
First one's courage.

32:08.740 --> 32:11.334
I don't have time
for these stupid games!

32:11.409 --> 32:14.344
To test your courage
and find your animality...

32:14.379 --> 32:16.643
you've got to enter
a dream state.

32:17.249 --> 32:19.649
How am I supposed to do that?

32:22.988 --> 32:27.618
There's a slow way
and a fast way.

32:27.659 --> 32:29.820
No time for the slow way.

32:30.862 --> 32:32.329
That's what I thought you'd say.

32:35.467 --> 32:37.230
Sweet dreams.

32:47.412 --> 32:51.815
I had faith in you,
but you failed me.

32:52.717 --> 32:54.582
You are not the warrior
I thought you were.

32:55.787 --> 32:58.688
What if I fail everyone?

32:58.723 --> 33:00.884
Your brother's soul is mine!

33:06.998 --> 33:09.023
Fight from the inside.

33:09.067 --> 33:13.333
It's the fire inside of you,
your faith in yourself...

33:13.738 --> 33:15.569
that can never be defeated.

33:17.242 --> 33:21.008
The fire inside you is killed.

33:21.046 --> 33:23.514
You lost Kitana.

33:23.548 --> 33:25.015
You are not a leader.

33:25.083 --> 33:26.914
Find that power inside you.

33:27.886 --> 33:29.353
Feel your animality.

33:38.330 --> 33:41.731
You will fail!

34:32.717 --> 34:34.184
I am Jade.

34:39.357 --> 34:42.087
I have searched the mesa
for you.

34:47.431 --> 34:50.525
Of all the horrors
darkness holds...

34:50.568 --> 34:53.128
to die alone...

34:54.873 --> 34:56.534
that is my worst fear.

35:04.349 --> 35:07.785
With you, I'm not afraid.

35:11.656 --> 35:14.352
This is almost
too good to be true.

35:17.362 --> 35:19.626
The same
could be said about you.

35:31.309 --> 35:32.503
My heart...

35:34.679 --> 35:36.613
belongs to another.

35:50.695 --> 35:52.287
I can't.

35:52.330 --> 35:53.888
There's not much time left.

36:08.813 --> 36:10.678
Is this just another dream?

36:21.059 --> 36:25.723
How can you beat Shao-Kahn
when I am too much for you?

36:51.856 --> 36:54.552
First you betray me,
now you laugh?

36:54.592 --> 36:57.459
You are more pure and faithful
than I heard.

36:58.997 --> 37:01.124
You have passed the test.

37:02.133 --> 37:03.395
A test?

37:07.372 --> 37:09.670
This was just another one
of Nightwolf's tests?

37:11.809 --> 37:13.572
We could have killed each other!

37:13.645 --> 37:15.135
But we'll live.

37:22.253 --> 37:24.414
I will lead you to the temple
of the Elder Gods.

37:24.455 --> 37:26.423
I can't.

37:26.457 --> 37:28.755
If this was a test,
it was only his second.

37:28.793 --> 37:30.317
I'm not ready.

37:30.361 --> 37:32.522
Not ready to save Kitana?

37:33.498 --> 37:35.762
Because she's the key.

37:35.800 --> 37:38.268
I can take you to her.

37:38.303 --> 37:39.770
She's alive?

37:39.804 --> 37:43.103
For now, yes.
For how long, I cannot say.

37:48.012 --> 37:49.479
We must go.

38:11.369 --> 38:14.463
All your past betrayals
I can forgive.

38:16.107 --> 38:18.632
Please accept this offering.

38:18.710 --> 38:20.678
I do not want your death.

38:49.907 --> 38:52.637
You test my patience.

38:59.250 --> 39:01.115
You destroyed my family.

39:01.152 --> 39:03.780
You drove my mother
to kill herself.

39:03.821 --> 39:06.289
I am your enemy forever.

39:07.825 --> 39:10.726
Kill me now... if you dare.

39:10.762 --> 39:13.754
Foolish child.

39:16.668 --> 39:19.637
A struggling worm on a hook...

39:19.671 --> 39:22.333
lands a bigger catch
than a dead one.

39:36.988 --> 39:40.424
No trees, no animals.

39:41.325 --> 39:42.792
What's going on here?

39:45.029 --> 39:46.496
Nature's dying.

39:49.434 --> 39:51.834
The merger of the realms
is almost done.

39:51.869 --> 39:54.497
You keep talking
about mergers and realms...

39:54.539 --> 39:56.063
but it don't mean squat to me.

39:56.140 --> 39:58.233
I can't explain it.

39:58.309 --> 40:01.142
We've only got a few days.

40:01.179 --> 40:03.010
Use your imagination.

40:03.047 --> 40:04.537
Use my imagination?

40:08.586 --> 40:11.282
You keep talking like that,
and I'm gonna split.

40:13.091 --> 40:15.924
You dragged me out the base
with some killers after us...

40:15.960 --> 40:18.360
put me in a ball, take me
halfway around the world.

40:18.396 --> 40:20.455
If I'm gonna die today,
tell me why.

40:21.399 --> 40:24.061
Nobody told me
why Johnny had to die.

40:24.969 --> 40:26.493
What is it with you?

40:26.537 --> 40:27.970
Who the hell is Johnny?

40:29.440 --> 40:31.032
I'm your partner.

40:31.109 --> 40:33.009
If you can't trust me,
who can you trust?

40:33.044 --> 40:35.410
Nobody but me.

40:35.446 --> 40:37.209
Nobody but you?

40:37.248 --> 40:40.081
Every time you needed me,
I was there.

40:40.118 --> 40:42.780
I'm in the middle of nowhere
because of you!

40:44.589 --> 40:47.285
I need to use the rest room.
I got no toilet tissue.

40:47.325 --> 40:49.885
I got metal on my hands!

41:30.434 --> 41:32.197
You wish.

42:57.021 --> 42:59.387
I told you these arms were good
for something.

43:05.396 --> 43:06.795
Thanks.

43:09.767 --> 43:10.961
I owe you one.

43:11.002 --> 43:13.197
I don't know how much longer
I can take this.

43:13.237 --> 43:15.364
You look good in mud.

43:16.974 --> 43:18.202
You do.

43:20.544 --> 43:22.341
I got to find a river.

43:25.883 --> 43:27.578
We better roll.

43:28.586 --> 43:30.213
They don't use parachutes.

44:08.926 --> 44:11.827
I have come
to the eternal palace...

44:11.862 --> 44:14.626
because your sacred rules
have been broken.

44:20.237 --> 44:22.398
Shao-Kahn has invaded the earth.

44:38.789 --> 44:42.987
As always,
you are granted three questions.

44:46.397 --> 44:48.490
Why was this treachery allowed?

44:48.532 --> 44:51.433
We do not control man's destiny.

44:51.469 --> 44:54.905
Everyone can change their fate.

44:58.242 --> 45:00.710
You'll stand by and watch
the ruination of earth?

45:00.778 --> 45:02.075
You are correct.

45:02.113 --> 45:05.605
Kitana is the key
to closing Kahn's portals.

45:06.884 --> 45:09.512
If I reunite her with Sindel...

45:09.553 --> 45:13.045
how can I be sure Kahn's portals
will stay closed?

45:13.090 --> 45:17.356
Only when Shao-Kahn is destroyed
will the future be safe.

45:17.395 --> 45:21.832
Do you believe the humans
are worth saving?

45:21.866 --> 45:24.562
More than anything I know.

45:24.602 --> 45:28.470
Do you love them enough
to sacrifice your immortality?

45:40.651 --> 45:42.676
I don't see street signs,
mailboxes.

45:42.720 --> 45:44.415
Which temple's the Elder Gods'?

45:44.455 --> 45:45.979
Keep moving.

45:58.736 --> 45:59.862
You know this dude?

46:04.642 --> 46:06.473
Is that Jax?

46:06.544 --> 46:08.171
Who is she?

46:08.245 --> 46:10.941
Jade, this is Sonya Blade.

46:12.283 --> 46:14.046
Major Jackson Briggs.

46:15.019 --> 46:18.455
You've got incredible legs...
for kicking.

46:19.957 --> 46:21.549
Where Kitana?

46:23.594 --> 46:25.858
She was kidnapped by Scorpion.

46:25.896 --> 46:28.126
You lost Kitana
and picked up her?

46:28.165 --> 46:29.723
She helped me get here.

46:31.335 --> 46:34.862
Thanks to you,
we got Kahn's squads on us.

46:34.905 --> 46:36.532
Can I make a suggestion?

46:36.607 --> 46:40.771
Let's worry about bigger things,
like staying alive.

47:09.673 --> 47:11.106
He's not here, either.

47:11.175 --> 47:13.109
We're just gonna wait
for this dude?

47:13.144 --> 47:14.668
Without Rayden, it's hopeless.

47:23.220 --> 47:24.983
Never give up hope.

47:28.659 --> 47:30.286
At least not so early.

47:31.162 --> 47:32.629
It's a new look.

47:35.065 --> 47:37.693
Who's she? Can she fight
as good as she looks?

47:37.735 --> 47:39.225
Better.

47:39.270 --> 47:41.795
Good, because I was expecting
a team of fighters.

47:41.839 --> 47:44.330
Instead, I hear fighters
at war with each other.

47:44.375 --> 47:46.673
Give us a break.
We've been through hell.

47:46.744 --> 47:49.542
Compared to what lies ahead,
you've been through nothing.

47:50.948 --> 47:52.176
Where's Kitana?

47:52.216 --> 47:54.810
Kahn took her.
It's all my fault.

47:54.852 --> 47:56.820
This is not about blame.

47:56.854 --> 47:58.549
We're together in this.

47:58.589 --> 48:03.049
Each of us must support
the others, like a family.

48:03.093 --> 48:04.321
What's with your arms?

48:04.361 --> 48:07.330
I've known you one minute,
and you're dissin' me already?

48:07.364 --> 48:09.229
I mean no disrespect.

48:09.266 --> 48:10.858
You have real skills.

48:10.901 --> 48:13.165
Those arms aren't your strength.
They're your weakness.

48:13.204 --> 48:14.569
Thanks for the tip.

48:14.605 --> 48:17.802
These things
are state of the art.

48:17.875 --> 48:20.810
Faith in yourself
is all you need.

48:20.844 --> 48:22.709
I say that to all of you.

48:26.817 --> 48:29.115
I'll try to open a portal
to Outworld.

48:29.153 --> 48:30.415
Follow me!

48:59.316 --> 49:01.181
My powers are leaving me.

49:04.188 --> 49:08.056
Who does he think he is,
Moses parting the Red Sea?

49:11.262 --> 49:14.129
Destroy... everything!

49:34.218 --> 49:36.118
Whenever you're ready.

49:57.508 --> 49:59.066
Come on.

50:06.216 --> 50:08.309
That was fun.

50:08.352 --> 50:12.448
They have taken the bait
and fallen into our trap.

50:12.489 --> 50:14.650
Proceed as planned.

50:14.692 --> 50:17.024
I will await your arrival
in Outworld.

50:26.937 --> 50:29.371
My skin is burning,
but I'm freezing inside.

50:29.406 --> 50:31.033
Feels like I got microwaved.

50:31.108 --> 50:32.769
You never get used to that.

50:33.544 --> 50:35.478
Is that what I think it is?

50:36.680 --> 50:38.807
The realms are merging.

50:38.849 --> 50:41.750
This will continue unless
Kahn's portals are closed.

50:42.486 --> 50:44.579
Time is against us.

50:44.621 --> 50:47.351
- People in their cars...
- Torn between realms.

50:47.391 --> 50:49.222
It's like a nightmare.

50:49.259 --> 50:50.920
We have to stop this.

50:52.296 --> 50:54.924
To do that,
we must rescue Kitana.

50:56.300 --> 50:59.167
I know Kahn took Kitana
to his fortress.

50:59.203 --> 51:01.694
Hold up. Kahn?

51:01.739 --> 51:03.297
You mean Mr. Bad Attitude?

51:03.340 --> 51:05.365
You want to check out his crib?

51:05.442 --> 51:07.410
No way.

51:07.444 --> 51:09.503
I ain't going
on no suicide mission.

51:11.248 --> 51:12.579
Jax is right.

51:12.616 --> 51:15.050
That's probably
what Kahn wants us to do.

51:16.387 --> 51:18.321
There is a secret passageway.

51:19.056 --> 51:20.921
I used it to escape.

51:39.977 --> 51:42.537
How could you believe
the ruination of the temple...

51:42.613 --> 51:44.843
would not jeopardize our plan?

51:44.882 --> 51:47.112
It was necessary
to convince the mortals...

51:47.151 --> 51:49.312
their only hope lie in Outworld.

51:49.353 --> 51:53.414
You seem confident that Sindel
will capture them in your trap.

51:53.457 --> 51:56.255
I promise you, on my soul.

51:56.293 --> 51:59.592
All the millenniums of planning
will be rewarded.

51:59.630 --> 52:01.928
You will be proud.

52:01.965 --> 52:04.126
Know this...

52:04.168 --> 52:07.934
I will take your soul myself
if you fail.

52:11.041 --> 52:14.408
I will rally
the extermination squads...

52:14.445 --> 52:17.471
and prepare for victory.

52:17.548 --> 52:20.483
The merger
will soon be complete.

52:20.517 --> 52:24.248
All your friends will be dead.

52:34.865 --> 52:36.890
This must have been Edenia.

52:41.972 --> 52:43.667
The royal family's temple.

52:43.740 --> 52:45.367
Kitana said I'd find it here.

52:51.014 --> 52:53.209
She's having a bad hair day.

53:06.296 --> 53:08.059
They must have followed us.

53:12.302 --> 53:16.295
Perhaps, but it may be
a blessing in disguise.

53:16.340 --> 53:19.207
We need Sindel
to close Kahn's portals forever.

53:19.276 --> 53:22.404
- I'll take care of her.
- I'll rescue Kitana.

54:47.431 --> 54:50.798
Something finally went right.
We won.

54:50.834 --> 54:52.802
Who finished off Sindel?

54:52.836 --> 54:56.602
After she blasted you,
I surprised her from behind.

54:57.608 --> 55:00.099
Maybe she came in handy
after all.

55:03.447 --> 55:09.909
You are witness to the dawning
of mankind's final day!

55:09.953 --> 55:13.912
The two realms will be one!

55:16.827 --> 55:21.230
Rayden and his mortals
have fallen for my trick...

55:21.264 --> 55:24.290
and failed to stop us.

55:24.334 --> 55:28.737
Bring Rayden and his mortals
to bow at my feet.

55:28.772 --> 55:34.768
With their dying breaths,
they can witness the birth...

55:34.845 --> 55:39.248
of the greatest army
in existence!

57:02.933 --> 57:04.901
It's a trap. Leave!

57:37.334 --> 57:38.801
Up there!

59:10.126 --> 59:11.991
The date's over.

59:32.649 --> 59:33.809
Only your love...

59:34.651 --> 59:36.642
can reunite her body and soul.

59:37.153 --> 59:38.313
Kitana...

59:38.655 --> 59:40.452
your love...

59:40.490 --> 59:42.958
can break the hold
Kahn has over your mother...

59:42.993 --> 59:44.961
and close his portals to earth.

01:00:19.429 --> 01:00:22.159
I have prayed for the day...

01:00:22.832 --> 01:00:24.163
when our love...

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:25.997
will bring us together again.

01:00:37.647 --> 01:00:40.514
I have never loved you.

01:00:40.550 --> 01:00:44.008
With such a pathetic child,
what reason was there to love?

01:00:44.888 --> 01:00:46.719
I knew it could not be true.

01:00:47.057 --> 01:00:48.354
It cannot be.

01:00:48.892 --> 01:00:52.658
But it can... and it is.

01:00:52.696 --> 01:00:56.063
And you are powerless...

01:00:56.099 --> 01:00:58.192
Thunder God.

01:01:04.841 --> 01:01:06.103
It's over.

01:01:06.176 --> 01:01:07.768
You fools.

01:01:07.844 --> 01:01:09.436
You've been tricked.

01:01:09.512 --> 01:01:11.377
The legend was a lie.

01:01:11.414 --> 01:01:14.212
Kahn's portals stay open.

01:01:14.250 --> 01:01:17.708
Now the merger
is nearly complete.

01:01:17.754 --> 01:01:19.278
How could you do this?

01:01:21.624 --> 01:01:23.683
It was so easy.

01:01:25.595 --> 01:01:27.654
You will die for this, Jade.

01:02:06.269 --> 01:02:07.167
That's it.

01:02:07.203 --> 01:02:08.500
We trusted you, man.

01:02:08.538 --> 01:02:09.903
And what happens?

01:02:09.939 --> 01:02:11.930
You take us
on a wild goose chase.

01:02:11.975 --> 01:02:14.000
I don't understand.

01:02:14.077 --> 01:02:16.375
You were advised
by the other gods.

01:02:17.013 --> 01:02:18.480
The gods must've lied to me.

01:02:18.515 --> 01:02:20.142
Forget your gods...

01:02:20.183 --> 01:02:21.480
and immortals...

01:02:21.518 --> 01:02:23.315
and all that junk!

01:02:23.353 --> 01:02:26.652
The only ones we can trust
from here on out are humans.

01:02:26.689 --> 01:02:29.123
Nobody else, not even Rayden.

01:02:29.159 --> 01:02:30.285
Don't you understand?

01:02:30.326 --> 01:02:33.625
By leading us here,
he is mortal now like you.

01:02:33.663 --> 01:02:35.756
All his powers
have been sacrificed.

01:02:35.799 --> 01:02:36.925
That's even worse.

01:02:36.966 --> 01:02:38.763
How do we stop Kahn now?

01:02:38.802 --> 01:02:40.827
There's more to this than Kahn.

01:02:42.005 --> 01:02:44.872
If Sindel is not the key
to closing Kahn's portals,

01:02:44.941 --> 01:02:46.909
then Kahn
has a higher allegiance.

01:02:48.378 --> 01:02:49.572
Wait a second.

01:02:50.046 --> 01:02:52.037
That tattoo.
I've seen it before.

01:02:52.415 --> 01:02:54.178
On a robot and a woman.

01:02:54.217 --> 01:02:56.014
They both tried to kill me.

01:02:56.052 --> 01:02:58.043
And both of them
worked for Kahn.

01:03:02.492 --> 01:03:04.460
This tattoo is a family crest...

01:03:04.961 --> 01:03:06.952
bestowed only to my bloodline.

01:03:08.298 --> 01:03:09.731
It is a permanent mark...

01:03:09.766 --> 01:03:11.927
that allows safe passage
through the portals...

01:03:11.968 --> 01:03:14.027
for the bearer
and his passengers.

01:03:14.070 --> 01:03:17.267
Did the tattoos you saw
flee the fighter upon death?

01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:18.898
Like a bat out of hell.

01:03:18.975 --> 01:03:20.602
Temporary passes.

01:03:20.677 --> 01:03:22.508
The did not share my bloodline.

01:03:22.545 --> 01:03:24.740
But if it's your family crest...

01:03:24.781 --> 01:03:26.942
how can Kahn's side
have it, too?

01:03:27.684 --> 01:03:29.675
My father is an Elder God.

01:03:30.186 --> 01:03:32.450
And only they can bestow
such a marking.

01:03:33.022 --> 01:03:35.115
Your dad's an Elder God?

01:03:39.496 --> 01:03:42.158
Funny how you failed
to mention that before.

01:03:45.135 --> 01:03:47.330
If your father's an Elder God...

01:03:48.671 --> 01:03:50.298
what does that make Kahn?

01:03:58.381 --> 01:04:00.076
Shao-Kahn is my brother.

01:04:13.129 --> 01:04:14.596
It was not my fault.

01:04:14.631 --> 01:04:16.690
I did everything you ordered.

01:04:16.733 --> 01:04:19.099
It was your job
to lure them to an ambush.

01:04:19.135 --> 01:04:22.366
If they escaped,
then you failed me!

01:04:22.405 --> 01:04:24.771
We could never
have stopped them alone.

01:04:24.807 --> 01:04:26.104
Listen to her.

01:04:26.176 --> 01:04:27.643
She speaks the truth.

01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:29.575
We would've died trying.

01:04:29.612 --> 01:04:31.011
You.

01:04:32.015 --> 01:04:33.846
You are already dead!

01:04:36.019 --> 01:04:37.043
And you...

01:04:38.188 --> 01:04:39.678
will be soon.

01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:56.468
You will mount a defense
around my newest temple.

01:04:56.506 --> 01:04:59.304
Prepare for Rayden to make
one last attack.

01:04:59.375 --> 01:05:01.866
You said Rayden
was no longer to be feared.

01:05:01.945 --> 01:05:03.776
I am to be feared!

01:05:03.813 --> 01:05:05.178
If you fail me...

01:05:05.215 --> 01:05:07.775
I will feed
your rotting corpse...

01:05:07.817 --> 01:05:09.148
to the worms!

01:05:13.556 --> 01:05:17.117
Your hallowed position
atop the worm pile...

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:19.788
appears to be most tenuous.

01:05:20.797 --> 01:05:25.166
Now your failure
will be my opportunity.

01:05:32.342 --> 01:05:35.004
Man, you got
one dysfunctional family.

01:05:35.078 --> 01:05:37.478
Years ago,
my father decreed...

01:05:37.513 --> 01:05:40.949
his heir to the family throne
must be strong enough...

01:05:41.017 --> 01:05:43.884
to kill his own brother
in battle if necessary.

01:05:45.088 --> 01:05:46.851
I beat my brother...

01:05:48.024 --> 01:05:49.548
but I could not kill him.

01:05:49.592 --> 01:05:51.492
Only one thing is certain.

01:05:52.662 --> 01:05:54.095
Kahn must die.

01:05:54.998 --> 01:05:56.522
This time you'll kill him.

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.690
I could not then.

01:05:59.669 --> 01:06:01.034
I cannot now.

01:06:01.070 --> 01:06:03.595
So what do we do?

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:05.699
You will do your best.

01:06:06.109 --> 01:06:07.906
It is all that can be expected.

01:06:07.977 --> 01:06:09.569
I will pray for you all.

01:06:12.982 --> 01:06:14.244
Listen to me.

01:06:14.284 --> 01:06:15.945
Liu is our only hope.

01:06:18.988 --> 01:06:20.683
I want to fight Kahn...

01:06:20.723 --> 01:06:22.452
but I may not be ready.

01:06:22.492 --> 01:06:24.392
You must believe in yourself.

01:06:25.061 --> 01:06:26.323
We believe in you.

01:07:05.935 --> 01:07:07.095
My home.

01:07:08.938 --> 01:07:11.099
The Temple
of the Order of Light.

01:07:11.474 --> 01:07:12.771
Your family.

01:07:14.143 --> 01:07:16.111
There's so little time left.

01:07:17.146 --> 01:07:19.114
Whatever time we have...

01:07:19.148 --> 01:07:20.615
we must use well.

01:07:21.818 --> 01:07:23.979
Are we really ready to die here?

01:07:26.322 --> 01:07:27.482
If we die...

01:07:28.491 --> 01:07:29.981
we will die in battle.

01:07:31.627 --> 01:07:32.787
Together.

01:08:31.821 --> 01:08:35.381
Prepare for final battle!

01:08:42.865 --> 01:08:44.799
So good of you to join us, son.

01:08:46.502 --> 01:08:49.938
In under one hour, the merger
of realms will be complete.

01:08:49.971 --> 01:08:52.964
Father, you alone
have the power to end this.

01:08:53.009 --> 01:08:53.975
Stop!

01:08:54.510 --> 01:08:57.138
I do not want to remember you
this weak!

01:08:57.212 --> 01:08:59.613
It is not weak to value life!

01:09:01.617 --> 01:09:05.678
I offer you one final chance
to return to my side, Rayden.

01:09:06.456 --> 01:09:09.357
To rule all realms
with your family.

01:09:14.430 --> 01:09:15.828
They are my family.

01:09:16.765 --> 01:09:20.862
Then you shall die with the rest
of your pathetic human race!

01:09:20.903 --> 01:09:21.892
Finish him!

01:09:23.104 --> 01:09:25.095
You should have killed me...

01:09:26.776 --> 01:09:28.767
when you had the chance...

01:09:29.612 --> 01:09:30.578
brother.

01:09:30.979 --> 01:09:33.312
My brother died a long time ago.

01:09:34.149 --> 01:09:35.617
His heart, anyway.

01:09:50.032 --> 01:09:51.522
I win...

01:09:51.567 --> 01:09:52.966
brother.

01:10:08.684 --> 01:10:11.016
You cannot die.

01:10:12.188 --> 01:10:14.179
I am proud to die...

01:10:15.191 --> 01:10:16.351
a mortal.

01:10:19.829 --> 01:10:20.989
Like you.

01:10:42.852 --> 01:10:46.379
This is the beginning
of the end!

01:10:47.223 --> 01:10:49.191
Show them the way...

01:10:49.225 --> 01:10:51.193
to oblivion!

01:10:54.230 --> 01:10:55.754
Mr. Ed is mine.

01:10:59.702 --> 01:11:00.930
I'll take my mother.

01:11:04.473 --> 01:11:06.873
Leftovers are fine with me.

01:11:14.350 --> 01:11:16.011
I'll make you eat that thing.

01:11:28.497 --> 01:11:30.488
I can't take
too much more of this.

01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:35.136
Is that all you got?

01:11:45.881 --> 01:11:47.781
Is that any way
to treat your mother?

01:11:47.817 --> 01:11:49.284
My mother's dead.

01:11:49.318 --> 01:11:51.252
As soon will be her daughter.

01:12:11.974 --> 01:12:14.841
That just leaves
you and me, Kahn.

01:12:51.514 --> 01:12:53.846
Pathetic and weak.

01:12:53.883 --> 01:12:57.080
Clearly Rayden has molded you
in his image.

01:13:30.686 --> 01:13:32.313
Without your weapons...

01:13:32.354 --> 01:13:34.185
you are no match for Motaro.

01:14:38.354 --> 01:14:40.686
Jax, help!

01:14:44.326 --> 01:14:46.317
I got everything I need
right here!

01:15:18.761 --> 01:15:19.955
Help!

01:15:21.430 --> 01:15:22.454
Get off her.

01:15:32.007 --> 01:15:33.338
Get down, Sonya.

01:15:35.578 --> 01:15:38.046
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:40.480
So you finally got
your confidence back, huh?

01:15:40.516 --> 01:15:42.347
Finally asked for help, huh?

01:15:43.185 --> 01:15:44.652
Whatever you are...

01:15:44.687 --> 01:15:46.985
you will live
to see the end of Kahn...

01:15:47.022 --> 01:15:49.684
to give my mother's soul peace.

01:16:01.103 --> 01:16:02.764
Face it, Liu Kang.

01:16:03.105 --> 01:16:05.938
You will fail!

01:16:13.482 --> 01:16:16.110
I can feel...

01:16:26.595 --> 01:16:28.187
Now I done seen everything.

01:16:31.533 --> 01:16:32.932
Impressive.

01:16:32.968 --> 01:16:34.629
You've come prepared.

01:16:35.204 --> 01:16:37.570
But not good enough.

01:17:49.745 --> 01:17:51.212
Your blood flows, Kahn.

01:17:51.246 --> 01:17:53.510
Just like the blood of a mortal.

01:17:56.352 --> 01:17:57.842
How can this be?

01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:01.250
I warned you
there would be consequences...

01:18:01.290 --> 01:18:03.588
for breaking the sacred rules.

01:18:03.625 --> 01:18:05.923
But I did not expect this.

01:18:05.961 --> 01:18:08.088
Must I do everything for you?

01:18:29.651 --> 01:18:32.119
The fate of the universe...

01:18:32.154 --> 01:18:35.453
will be decided as it should be.

01:18:35.491 --> 01:18:38.289
In Mortal Kombat.

01:19:06.155 --> 01:19:09.283
Nothing can alter your destiny,
nor mine!

01:19:12.194 --> 01:19:14.424
I can, and I will!

01:21:21.823 --> 01:21:24.155
That was the longest week
of my life.

01:21:24.193 --> 01:21:25.785
Oh, come on, Jax.

01:21:25.827 --> 01:21:26.953
Could've been worse.

01:21:26.995 --> 01:21:29.190
Could've been the last week
of our lives.

01:21:29.231 --> 01:21:30.664
I guess that's right.

01:21:33.168 --> 01:21:34.829
What's up with that?

01:21:57.226 --> 01:21:58.318
Was I dead?

01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:00.487
It is only right
that Shinnok's son...

01:22:00.529 --> 01:22:04.090
be allowed to take his place
in the Eternal Palace.

01:22:04.132 --> 01:22:06.464
You've become one of us.

01:22:15.677 --> 01:22:18.009
I will never forget
this moment, Liu.

01:22:25.187 --> 01:22:27.519
You've all made me very proud.

01:22:31.493 --> 01:22:32.983
I will be watching you...

01:22:33.662 --> 01:22:35.152
so stay out of trouble.

01:22:37.499 --> 01:22:38.523
And remember...

01:22:39.501 --> 01:22:40.968
be there for one another.
