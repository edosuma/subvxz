00:08.883 --> 00:10.593
Hi, I'm Mickey.
Sex and love addict.

00:10.677 --> 00:11.803
Hi, Mickey.

00:11.886 --> 00:16.433
Things are going well right now.
I've got a good boyfriend, good job.

00:16.516 --> 00:20.186
Now I'm just worried
that I'm gonna act out and ruin it all.

00:20.687 --> 00:25.191
You know, I'm so used to self-sabotaging
that what if I start doing it,

00:25.275 --> 00:27.569
and I don't even realize
that I'm doing it?

00:28.570 --> 00:31.698
It feels like everything's not supposed
to go right at the same time.

00:31.781 --> 00:34.200
I can't be happy at work
and in my relationship.

00:34.284 --> 00:37.328
So, now I'm just waiting
for the other shoe to drop.

00:37.412 --> 00:39.497
How am I gonna fuck this up?

00:39.581 --> 00:40.832
<i>So far it's been great.</i>

00:42.208 --> 00:45.211
She's really happy. I'm really happy.
We're really happy together.

00:45.295 --> 00:47.046
She's killing it at work.

00:48.089 --> 00:49.257
And...

00:49.674 --> 00:51.551
I get worried 'cause it makes me wonder...

00:53.219 --> 00:55.430
did I only like her
'cause she is messed up?

00:58.183 --> 01:00.477
Do I feel the only reason
she could like me

01:00.560 --> 01:02.103
is because she's messed up?

01:04.189 --> 01:05.857
<i>It's an interesting question, Maria.</i>

01:05.940 --> 01:08.985
<i>And when I'm faced</i>
<i>with a decision like that, I ask myself,</i>

01:09.069 --> 01:14.783
<i>"Five years from now, what decision </i>
<i>will make future me the most proud?"</i>

01:14.866 --> 01:18.036
<i>That's always been my guide,</i>
<i>and it's worked well for me so far.</i>

01:18.119 --> 01:22.207
<i>So, you know, </i>
<i>there's no crime in liking yourself.</i>

01:22.791 --> 01:24.292
And when I feel anxious,

01:24.375 --> 01:27.462
I'm gonna breathe through it,
I'm gonna count to ten,

01:27.545 --> 01:30.215
and I'm going to tell myself
that I fucking deserve to be happy,

01:30.298 --> 01:31.841
which I still don't believe.

01:33.301 --> 01:35.220
I do not believe
that I deserve to be happy.

01:35.303 --> 01:36.596
But one day I'm gonna get there.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.099
I'm just gonna try not to ruin it today.

01:40.850 --> 01:44.062
That's all I got.
"Try not to ruin it today."

01:44.979 --> 01:48.817
Sometimes I feel like
I'm a bowl of mac and cheese.

01:48.900 --> 01:49.943
You know?

01:50.026 --> 01:51.778
The first few bites are really great,

01:52.403 --> 01:55.532
then about halfway in,
you're kind of like...

01:55.615 --> 01:57.617
"I think I've had enough mac and cheese."

01:58.326 --> 01:59.744
By the last few bites, you're like,

01:59.828 --> 02:03.373
"I am never eating mac and cheese again.
This is disgusting."

02:04.958 --> 02:08.169
Sometimes I feel like I'm her bowl
of mac and cheese.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.216
I don't want her to get sick of me.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.635
<i>You wanna know</i>
<i>how the universe works? </i>

02:16.219 --> 02:20.098
<i>The universe challenges you to force you</i>

02:20.181 --> 02:23.393
<i>to move to a higher level. </i>

02:23.476 --> 02:26.855
<i>So, instead of saying,</i>
<i>"Screw you, universe,"</i>

02:26.938 --> 02:31.776
<i>maybe you should say, </i>
<i>"Thank you, universe." </i>

02:31.860 --> 02:34.154
<i>And with that, we'll be right back.</i>

02:53.256 --> 02:55.717
Look at my arm.
Do you see those scratch marks?

02:56.342 --> 02:57.552
I'll be a Dark One by midnight.

02:57.635 --> 02:59.387
Unless you take me out first.

02:59.470 --> 03:01.431
Are you crazy?
I won't kill you.

03:02.015 --> 03:05.393
You have no choice.
Once I'm a Dark One, I'll destroy you all.

03:05.476 --> 03:07.937
Wait a minute.
-She's getting half the words wrong.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.314
Do we care about that?

03:10.106 --> 03:11.733
She's also bad at acting.

03:11.816 --> 03:13.484
We still have time to find the antiserum.

03:13.568 --> 03:16.863
And I know just where to find it.
Let's go.

03:22.076 --> 03:23.244
And... cut.

03:23.328 --> 03:27.415
-For fuck's sake. Reset.

03:27.498 --> 03:28.374
Resetting!

03:28.458 --> 03:31.127
-Sorry.
-Not a good day to be super hungover.

03:31.210 --> 03:32.545
Did you go to the MTV thing last night?

03:32.629 --> 03:36.466
No, I had some friends from out of town.
We were out super late.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.760
This thing is, like,
up my butt.

03:38.843 --> 03:42.263
Why am I not in this scene?
This used to be my show.

03:42.347 --> 03:44.057
I know. It sucks, I'm sorry.

03:44.140 --> 03:47.352
Do they know how big my movie's gonna be?
I'm gonna be an action figure.

03:47.435 --> 03:50.480
I know.
They should use you as much as possible.

03:50.563 --> 03:53.066
My friends won't watch the scenes
I'm not in. They say they're shit.

03:54.192 --> 03:55.610
My friends are the same.

03:55.693 --> 03:58.446
It's this fucking haircut.
Did I get ugly or something?

03:58.529 --> 03:59.697
No, don't say that.

04:00.281 --> 04:03.159
Let me talk to them.
I'll find out what's happening, okay?

04:03.243 --> 04:05.286
Hold on. It'll be okay.

04:08.456 --> 04:12.085
All I'm saying is, it's not real.
Gluten isn't a real thing.

04:12.168 --> 04:14.629
Five years ago, we didn't know
what gluten was, and we were all living.

04:14.712 --> 04:18.758
I agree, but the fear of gluten
is very fucking real.

04:18.841 --> 04:21.219
I need you to get some gluten-free shit,

04:21.302 --> 04:24.389
or else I'm gonna have some crazy
batshit actresses refusing to work.

04:24.472 --> 04:27.767
What about the teamsters?
They want donuts with gluten.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.477
We can't piss off the teamsters.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.938
Just make it work.
-Excuse me.

04:32.563 --> 04:36.776
Sorry, excuse me.
Just a quick teeny-tiny question.

04:36.859 --> 04:39.445
Is there a reason Arya's not
in this scene?

04:39.529 --> 04:40.530
I was talking to her,

04:40.613 --> 04:43.950
and I think she's a little upset
she's not having a bigger part.

04:44.492 --> 04:46.744
I'm sorry.
What are you, her agent?

04:46.828 --> 04:48.663
-No, I'm her teacher--
-Yeah, her teacher.

04:48.746 --> 04:50.373
So, why are you asking me?

04:50.456 --> 04:52.250
Well, I was talking to her,

04:52.333 --> 04:56.421
and she seemed kind of upset
that her part's getting smaller.

04:56.504 --> 04:59.757
-Smaller and smaller.
Okay, I'll play.

04:59.841 --> 05:02.468
I'll play. Yes.
Her part is getting smaller.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.595
You know why?
I'm fucking concerned about her.

05:04.679 --> 05:07.557
Okay, I am too, so it's nice to hear that,

05:07.640 --> 05:12.437
because I think she's really stressed out,
you know, with these new kids.

05:12.520 --> 05:15.606
I think she feels threatened by them
and she's got a new movie coming out.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.734
There's a lot pressure there.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.319
Her parents are getting divorced...

05:19.402 --> 05:21.529
I know.
I'm not concerned about any of that.

05:21.612 --> 05:24.574
I am concerned that
she is costing me money. Okay?

05:24.657 --> 05:26.326
-Okay.
-She's always late.

05:26.409 --> 05:28.578
Last week, I lost five hours

05:28.661 --> 05:31.664
because of her, because she was
too distracted to remember her lines,

05:31.748 --> 05:33.207
and that's her only job.

05:33.291 --> 05:36.085
She's going through a lot.
She's a kid, okay?

05:36.169 --> 05:39.297
Hey, you remember what it was like
when we were kids?

05:39.380 --> 05:42.425
Know what I wasn't doing when I was a kid?
Making $30,000 a week. Were you?

05:43.551 --> 05:46.554
-No. I had a job at Dairy Queen.
-Mm-hmm.

05:46.637 --> 05:52.226
Gus, I had an ovarian cyst the size
of a lemon removed last season,

05:52.310 --> 05:53.728
and you never heard a peep out of me.

05:53.811 --> 05:57.023
Last season, I found out
I had a 13

05:57.106 --> 05:59.108
Never met this kid
and I paid for his bar mitzvah.

05:59.192 --> 06:03.112
I kept my mouth shut, never missed
a call time 'cause that's this business.

06:03.196 --> 06:07.575
Yeah, I'm really thinking
about killing her off. This is a problem.

06:07.658 --> 06:08.701
I love it.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.454
While you're at it, kill off Xander.
He's been a B-word all season.

06:11.537 --> 06:12.789
Good idea.
Right?

06:12.872 --> 06:14.957
Whoa! Let's just pump the brakes.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.668
We don't have to kill off anybody.
I can talk to Arya.

06:17.752 --> 06:21.464
I'll fix this. I'm happy to.
She and I have a very good relationship.

06:21.547 --> 06:23.174
Yeah, great relationship.

06:23.257 --> 06:26.177
You know she does an imitation of you
everybody laughs at and you've never seen?

06:26.761 --> 06:28.262
I've seen that imitation.

06:28.346 --> 06:29.889
No, you have not. This is different.

06:29.972 --> 06:32.683
She does an imitation of you
thinking you've seen the imitation.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.602
-I've seen it.

06:34.685 --> 06:37.146
-Yeah, I've seen that.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.649
That's the best acting she's done
all season.

06:39.732 --> 06:43.694
Well, you rib the ones you love,
and she's not ribbing anybody else.

06:43.778 --> 06:46.322
No, no. This is mean. It's really funny.

06:46.405 --> 06:48.324
I just need you to do your job.

06:48.407 --> 06:50.952
Ten-four. I'll handle it.

06:51.953 --> 06:54.330
-Fred. Come on, fucking fix it.
-Okay.

06:54.413 --> 06:58.918
So, she could rip out a heart,
or she could rip out a kidney.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.591
-Kidney.
-Right. Kidney it is.

07:06.134 --> 07:10.430
So, it would be really great
if Stella could promote the book signing.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.140
-It's all about first-week sales.
-Of course.

07:12.223 --> 07:13.391
Getting on that bestseller list.

07:13.474 --> 07:17.311
If you don't get on that, they take
your book off shelves right away.

07:17.395 --> 07:22.608
So it'd be really helpful if Stella
could tweet about it or mention it.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.569
Why don't you tweet about the book?

07:24.652 --> 07:27.780
I'm off Twitter.
I was getting a lot of trolls.

07:27.864 --> 07:33.161
Well, a few trolls,
but many aggressive messages.

07:33.244 --> 07:36.664
Lot of anti-semitism.
I don't know why that was happening.

07:36.747 --> 07:39.000
I've never confirmed I'm Jewish, so...

07:39.083 --> 07:42.211
I don't think Stella does marketing
on her Twitter.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.547
It's not her thing. I'll tweet about it.

07:45.381 --> 07:47.425
Thanks, thanks.

07:47.508 --> 07:49.927
No offense, it's not the same, you know.

07:50.011 --> 07:52.638
You've got, what, 50 followers?

07:52.722 --> 07:57.018
What is it?
-Closer to half a million now, but...

07:57.101 --> 07:59.854
What? Half a million followers...
How does...

07:59.937 --> 08:01.898
I have more than 50, also, but...

08:01.981 --> 08:05.818
I can't force Stella to do anything.
She's an adult woman.

08:05.902 --> 08:08.446
I gave her the book.
If she likes it, she'll tweet about it.

08:08.529 --> 08:10.990
I'm talking about a favor.
Have you ever heard about a favor?

08:11.073 --> 08:13.659
You know what?
Could you be a little more grateful?

08:13.743 --> 08:16.162
Because Mickey here is
gonna be with you all day.

08:16.245 --> 08:20.541
I'm giving you Mickey all day
to help you livestream your book event.

08:20.625 --> 08:21.626
It's not my job.

08:22.585 --> 08:25.379
You know what? I'm gonna get out of here.

08:25.463 --> 08:30.593
I am going to prepare myself emotionally
and mentally to meet my fans.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.011
You might remember them,

08:32.094 --> 08:36.474
the thousands upon thousands of people
whose love of me built this station.

08:41.771 --> 08:42.605
Why me?

08:42.688 --> 08:46.776
It's important for the station
and you know how to deal with him.

08:46.859 --> 08:47.944
Can't deal with him anymore.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.780
Did you see who he dedicated his book to?

08:50.863 --> 08:54.367
Nelson Mandela and Mitch McConnell.

08:54.450 --> 08:58.579
Well, he's covering the bases there.
Jesus Christ.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.543
Hey, lunch buddy!

09:04.210 --> 09:07.046
What's up
How's it going?

09:07.129 --> 09:09.590
Bad. I'm trying to be normal
and eat with the crew,

09:09.674 --> 09:11.008
but no one will sit with me.

09:11.092 --> 09:13.803
No one will sit with you?
What about this guy?

09:13.886 --> 09:16.347
He's sitting with ya, right?
How's the script?

09:16.430 --> 09:20.560
It's really not very good.
There's a kissing scene.

09:20.643 --> 09:23.813
Yeah, the kissing scene. That's with...

09:23.896 --> 09:25.773
-It's with Jayke.

09:25.856 --> 09:28.651
Jayke... You know, the actor, Jayke,
the new one.

09:28.734 --> 09:32.113
-Yeah. I know Jayke. Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah.

09:32.196 --> 09:34.949
Yeah. Have you ever kissed a boy before?

09:35.533 --> 09:37.493
Gus, I've had, like, five boyfriends.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.454
All right.
So, you're not nervous about this?

09:40.538 --> 09:41.372
God, no.

09:41.455 --> 09:43.958
I'm not Drew Barrymore, but I've lived.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.796
Okay. If you were nervous,
we could talk about it.

09:48.879 --> 09:52.341
I better go run my lines. Excuse me.

09:52.425 --> 09:55.511
-You go run your lines. All right.
-You're distracting me.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.432
Wait. This isn't gonna work.

09:59.515 --> 10:02.602
Find out if there's a back entrance.
I'm gonna get mobbed in here.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.228
How many people are you expecting?

10:04.312 --> 10:08.441
I don't know. I mean, with social media,
sky's the limit.

10:08.524 --> 10:12.403
Just... Let's make sure
everybody knows where the fire exits are.

10:12.903 --> 10:15.114
Yeah, I should probably call
a fire marshal.

10:15.197 --> 10:16.490
Yeah. Good idea.

10:18.409 --> 10:19.535
What's that?

10:20.036 --> 10:22.163
It's makeup. For glare.

10:23.164 --> 10:27.126
What
Only women

10:27.209 --> 10:29.253
-No, no.
-All right. Thank you.

10:34.342 --> 10:37.553
Fuck. See, that's the thing.

10:37.637 --> 10:41.932
Once the glare's gone,
the top gets fucking wispy.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.018
Shit.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.320
-Hey. Hi.
-Hi, there.

10:54.403 --> 10:56.489
Hi, I'm from Gravity with Dr. Greg.

10:56.572 --> 10:58.115
I'm Todd. We talked?

10:58.199 --> 11:00.701
-Yes, Todd. Hi. Um...
-Yeah.

11:00.785 --> 11:03.412
What do you think the turnout is gonna be?

11:03.496 --> 11:04.830
This is gonna be it.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.417
-Yeah. Yeah.

11:09.001 --> 11:12.671
-No, no, no. We don't cancel.

11:12.755 --> 11:16.509
The event? I just set these...
We're ready. We're good to go.

11:16.592 --> 11:19.804
Dr. Greg is very sensitive.
He won't like these optics.

11:19.887 --> 11:23.391
We had two people for Barefoot Contessa.
We had a blast. It was incredible.

11:23.974 --> 11:28.145
Do you ever go door-to-door,
nearby businesses, pull people in for...

11:28.229 --> 11:30.773
-I can't. I can't leave the premises.

11:30.856 --> 11:34.235
Can we offer them money?
Could we offer people on the street money?

11:34.318 --> 11:35.528
-I can't do that.
-You can't.

11:35.611 --> 11:36.445
What else can I do?

11:36.529 --> 11:39.407
We really shouldn't cancel?
Isn't this bad?

11:39.490 --> 11:41.826
This is double Barefoot Contessa.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.245
Why don't you take out some chairs?

11:44.328 --> 11:46.122
-I can do that.
-All right.

11:46.205 --> 11:48.666
The optics will be much better.
These people are psyched.

11:48.749 --> 11:50.209
-This worked for Kelsey Grammer.
-Right.

11:50.292 --> 11:51.252
This'll work.

11:52.253 --> 11:54.880
It's a charity event
benefiting the homeless.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.340
I'm getting an award.

11:56.424 --> 11:58.509
You can write a couple jokes
about the homeless.

11:58.592 --> 11:59.468
How much?

11:59.552 --> 12:01.762
It's a charity event.

12:01.846 --> 12:05.850
I already give money to the Palestinians.
I'm stretched too thin as it is.

12:05.933 --> 12:07.893
You make jokes about the homeless
all the time.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.354
-Just give me one.
-I don't feel comfortable about this.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.481
-It's not like they'll be there.
-Hey.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.779
-She's doing well.

12:18.863 --> 12:22.867
I think she's nervous about
this kissing scene with Jayke, you know?

12:22.950 --> 12:25.703
I was thinking maybe there's something
we can do to help her.

12:26.328 --> 12:27.872
Maybe get some mom advice?

12:27.955 --> 12:32.418
Uh... No. No. I mean, she's 14,
and she is batshit crazy,

12:32.501 --> 12:35.379
and she doesn't talk to me anymore,
so, I can't.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.923
No. You gotta step away,
let her ride it out.

12:38.007 --> 12:41.135
Okay. I just wanted to make sure
Arya felt good about the scene.

12:41.218 --> 12:42.511
You know what? She's gonna be fine.

12:43.679 --> 12:45.514
-Okay.

12:45.598 --> 12:48.726
Hey, Jen.
Are you going to SoulCycle tonight?

12:48.809 --> 12:50.978
Concerned about your daughter.
That's all.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.315
Is the bread gluten

12:54.398 --> 12:58.777
No. It's bread. Normal bread.
Bread-bread. There's gluten in the bread.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.321
Do you have Ezekiel bread?

13:00.404 --> 13:02.531
-Yeah.

13:02.615 --> 13:06.076
There's two types of bread, white bread
and brown bread. Pick a side.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.579
You know what, are these berries organic?

13:09.371 --> 13:11.874
Dude, organic is a lie.
That's corporate interest, man.

13:11.957 --> 13:14.168
It's fine. The carrots will work.

13:14.251 --> 13:15.920
Bugs Bunny, eat the Twizzlers.

13:16.003 --> 13:18.589
-I don't like Twizzlers.
-Eat. Hey!

13:18.672 --> 13:21.091
Hey, what's up, Mr. C?

13:21.175 --> 13:24.094
Mr. C? I like that, that's very cool.

13:24.178 --> 13:26.597
I just wanted to ask you
for a little favor.

13:26.680 --> 13:30.601
Arya's stressing out about the scene
you're shooting later today.

13:30.684 --> 13:31.894
-Yeah, yeah.

13:31.977 --> 13:35.856
I was thinking maybe the two of you
could get together, rehearse.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.191
It might help her out.

13:37.274 --> 13:39.068
Plus, you haven't
spent much time together.

13:39.151 --> 13:40.611
Yeah, yeah. I know.

13:40.694 --> 13:43.948
I've been busy with the show and my music.

13:44.031 --> 13:46.492
I also spend ten hours a week
on my self-care.

13:46.575 --> 13:48.953
Wow. Ten hours. That's a lot.

13:50.454 --> 13:53.582
-Yeah. I'll rehearse with her.

13:53.666 --> 13:54.833
-For sure.
-All right.

13:54.917 --> 13:58.087
Hey, look at that 1,000-kilowatt smile
on that guy.

13:59.505 --> 14:00.589
Thanks.

14:02.049 --> 14:05.094
As your friend, I got to let you know
you sound like a pedophile sometimes.

14:05.177 --> 14:08.347
I know. I realized
as it was coming out of my mouth.

14:08.430 --> 14:12.226
His smile? Way too specific.
It's like you've been studying his mouth.

14:12.309 --> 14:13.644
Get out his face. He's a preteen.

14:13.727 --> 14:14.979
-His nuts haven't dropped yet.
-Right.

14:15.437 --> 14:17.147
I got your note, Kev. Thank you.

14:23.612 --> 14:26.323
I don't know how to tell you this,
so I'm gonna come out with it.

14:26.407 --> 14:27.575
There aren't a lot of people.

14:28.242 --> 14:29.743
What do you mean?
Give me a ballpark.

14:29.827 --> 14:33.873
If there was a ballpark that held
four people, it would be sold out.

14:33.956 --> 14:37.918
Fucking shit! Four people?
There's four fucking people in there?

14:38.002 --> 14:41.463
You always said if you could reach
just one person then...

14:41.547 --> 14:44.758
I didn't literally just mean
one person, okay?

14:44.842 --> 14:46.051
I'm not going in.

14:46.135 --> 14:48.721
I hope you have a plan to fix this,
considering it is your fault.

14:48.804 --> 14:50.389
-Yes.

14:50.472 --> 14:52.516
If you weren't spending
so much time with Stella,

14:52.600 --> 14:53.684
you could've promoted this.

14:53.767 --> 14:56.020
Why don't we call it off?
We can go home.

14:56.103 --> 14:59.064
You're telling me,
in a city of millions of people,

14:59.148 --> 15:01.358
you can't find 40 that need help? How will I find 40 people
in the next half hour

15:03.736 --> 15:04.570
to come into this thing?

15:04.653 --> 15:08.908
I don't know, but you better do it.
Fill it up! Fill it up, Mickey!

15:08.991 --> 15:10.618
All right. I will!

15:10.701 --> 15:12.620
All right. Fill it up!

15:16.165 --> 15:19.460
Hi! Could I interest you in coming in here
and listening to--

15:19.543 --> 15:20.628
I have an appointment.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.550
Hey, I don't really need to hear all
of the rejections.

15:26.634 --> 15:29.303
-Okay.

15:29.386 --> 15:30.930
All right. I'm gonna figure this out.

15:38.437 --> 15:41.482
"Now we've got nine dead
on our side, because I wasn't there."

15:41.565 --> 15:44.026
"Fine. You want the real answer?"

15:44.109 --> 15:45.903
"We don't have time for anything else."

15:46.445 --> 15:49.573
"I'd rather lose nine of them
than one of you. Okay?"

15:49.657 --> 15:51.075
"What did you say?"

15:51.158 --> 15:53.619
"I can live without them,
but I can't live without you."

15:54.161 --> 15:58.332
-And then we kiss. Cool! All right.
-Yep.

15:58.415 --> 16:00.876
Sorry, I'm not the best actor

16:00.960 --> 16:02.503
-Shut up. You're amazing.
-for you to do this with.

16:02.586 --> 16:04.964
You've got it.

16:05.047 --> 16:08.092
You're amazing, and then...
I don't know.

16:08.175 --> 16:10.010
You're the best in the new cast.

16:10.094 --> 16:13.931
Thanks. You don't have to say that.
It's not a competition.

16:14.556 --> 16:16.892
-A little bit.

16:16.976 --> 16:21.772
-I heard you do music.
How'd you know that?

16:21.855 --> 16:24.483
I mean, there's a giant organ
right behind you!

16:24.566 --> 16:28.946
Okay. Yeah, I bring it with me,
wherever I can.

16:29.029 --> 16:32.616
Hey, do you actually have time
to hear a song that I wrote?

16:32.700 --> 16:33.617
Yeah.

16:33.701 --> 16:35.536
I never play it for anyone. I wrote it.

16:35.619 --> 16:39.289
It's about how the people you love
the most can exploit you the most.

16:39.373 --> 16:41.667
That's my life story,
so I'm sure I'll love it.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.919
Okay, I've never played it
for anyone, so...

16:44.003 --> 16:45.629
-I'm ready.
-All right.

16:45.713 --> 16:49.633
This one... Hold on, let me find it...

16:49.717 --> 16:52.219
This is called "I Am Not Only Yours."

16:53.971 --> 16:56.724
<i>♪ I'm not only yours ♪</i>

16:56.807 --> 16:58.600
That beat?
-Yes.

16:58.684 --> 17:02.062
<i>♪ What I have is what I earned ♪</i>

17:03.439 --> 17:06.316

-You!

17:08.193 --> 17:09.820
<i>♪ If you share you with me, too ♪</i>

17:09.903 --> 17:13.615
Wait, this chorus... Wait for it.
It's about to drop.

17:19.538 --> 17:22.082

17:25.669 --> 17:28.172

17:28.255 --> 17:29.465

17:32.801 --> 17:34.053
It's very good.

17:34.136 --> 17:35.721
-Thank you.
-It's so original.

17:35.804 --> 17:38.682
-I've never heard anything like that.
-Wow. Thanks.

17:38.766 --> 17:42.352
It's amazing.
-Justin Bieber's engineer's friend.

17:42.436 --> 17:46.648
Well, I mean, that's still
pretty close to Justin Bieber.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.275
-I mean, it's amazing.
-Oh, I know.

17:48.358 --> 17:50.069
I was stoked
whenever I got to work with him.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.653
That's crazy. I loved it.

17:52.071 --> 17:55.365
Thank you.
Hey, we should take a trailer pic.

17:55.449 --> 17:56.825
-Yeah.
-And post it. Let's see.

17:57.326 --> 18:00.621
Come on. Do, like, a gangster sign.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.874
What?

18:03.957 --> 18:05.793
Oh, God. Please don't post that
without a filter.

18:05.876 --> 18:09.797
Yeah, right. I'm gonna post it
when you leave to piss you off.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.840
-Oh, God, no. Please don't.

18:13.550 --> 18:15.886
That one's cute, though. Oh, God. No!

18:15.969 --> 18:18.639
-You look great in that one. Stop.
-I look so bad.

18:24.686 --> 18:29.024
Hi. Sorry to interrupt.
Uh... How's this meeting?

18:29.108 --> 18:31.276
It's good. It's good.
I mean, it just ended, but...

18:31.360 --> 18:34.613
Oh, yeah. I don't live nearby,
so I've never been to it before.

18:34.696 --> 18:38.367
But, um... I was wondering
if I could ask you guys for a favor.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.744
I've got a friend
who's in distress right now.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.371
-Well...

18:43.872 --> 18:45.791
Have you heard of this gentleman?

18:45.874 --> 18:48.210
Yeah, I know him.
I listen to this.

18:48.293 --> 18:49.128
You do?

18:49.211 --> 18:51.130
Great. He's a radio psychologist,

18:51.213 --> 18:53.507
and he's got this book event
happening across the street,

18:53.590 --> 18:55.467
and not that many people showed up.

18:55.551 --> 18:59.721
So, it'd be a real favor to me
and an act of service if you could come...

18:59.805 --> 19:01.765
Like, talking about right now?

19:01.849 --> 19:05.602
Like, 20 minutes.
You can finish your cigarette. Like...

19:05.686 --> 19:07.855
-Um... I'm down. I'm good.
-Yeah, I can.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.565
-I got nothing to do.
-Yeah.

19:14.778 --> 19:18.532
From <i>Witchita,</i> it's Arya Hopkins.

19:18.615 --> 19:22.995
With musical guest Blind Melon.

19:23.078 --> 19:25.330
Jesus, Gus. Get some new material.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.624
You're smiling. I see it.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.335
You in a better mood? Take it
you had a good rehearsal with Jayke.

19:30.878 --> 19:34.548
Yeah, it went well. He said
he would post a picture of us.

19:34.631 --> 19:37.718
He did, huh

19:38.260 --> 19:39.428
-Kinda.
-Yeah.

19:39.511 --> 19:41.555
I noticed he never posts
any pictures of me.

19:41.638 --> 19:44.433
A little messed up, right?
Just a little hurt.

19:44.725 --> 19:46.143

Uh... Jayke. Maybe he's doing a selfie.

19:56.778 --> 19:59.281
<i>-So sick.</i>

19:59.364 --> 20:00.490
Is that Brooklyn?

20:01.366 --> 20:03.160
Doesn't sound like her. I don't think so.

20:03.827 --> 20:05.120
Who's filming?

20:05.204 --> 20:06.705
-Could be his mom.
-Jesus!

20:06.788 --> 20:07.956
Maybe it's his mom.

20:21.220 --> 20:24.348
Saw the latest cuts of the show.
Strong, very strong.

20:24.431 --> 20:27.142
Thank you so much. The writing
is great this year, right?

20:27.226 --> 20:29.728
-Too modest. She won't take credit.
-Stop.

20:29.811 --> 20:31.230
Won't take credit.

20:35.442 --> 20:37.903
Oh, my God. Everybody, it's Arya Hopkins

20:37.986 --> 20:40.239

"As the caller I knew only
as Fran from Irwindale, stammered a thank you
between sobs of gratitude, I told her,

21:07.182 --> 21:10.644
'Thank yourself. You did the hard work.

21:10.727 --> 21:12.938
I only showed you the way.'

21:13.689 --> 21:18.902
Three years later,
I learned they had a beautiful baby boy.

21:19.444 --> 21:20.654
They named him Greg.

21:23.615 --> 21:25.284
I never asked why."

21:31.123 --> 21:32.582
That was powerful.

21:33.583 --> 21:35.043
Now it's time for some questions.

21:35.961 --> 21:36.795
Sir?

21:36.878 --> 21:39.798
-No, sir.

21:41.049 --> 21:42.676
Hi. I have a question.

21:42.759 --> 21:43.927
Great. What's your name?

21:44.011 --> 21:47.431
Fran from Irwindale, from your book.

21:47.514 --> 21:48.765
Yes. Yow--

21:50.183 --> 21:53.395
It's great to see ya, uh... Fran.

21:54.354 --> 21:55.814
What's your question?

21:55.981 --> 21:58.734
Is the whole book bullshit
or just the part about me?

22:10.162 --> 22:13.582
Gus! Gus! I've been looking
everywhere for you.

22:15.292 --> 22:16.126
No, I--

22:16.209 --> 22:17.794
Arya is stuck in her trailer.
She locked herself in.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.671
She won't come out.
She's having a meltdown on Instagram.

22:19.755 --> 22:20.589
Are you serious?

22:20.672 --> 22:23.050
Yeah. She's on Instagram,
posting all these sad photos.

22:23.133 --> 22:25.302
-Look at this. Meltdown.
-Oh, my God.

22:25.385 --> 22:26.553
-Meltdown.
-Oh, my God.

22:26.636 --> 22:29.514
-Meltdown. It's bad, man. It is bad.
-Fuck.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.391
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

22:31.475 --> 22:34.394
-Holy shit!
-Yeah.

22:34.478 --> 22:36.813
No. I was just on her Instagram.
She wasn't doing this.

22:36.897 --> 22:40.150
-This is her Finsta account.

22:40.233 --> 22:41.985
Yeah. You don't?

22:43.361 --> 22:46.698
I'm sure I do. I don't check.
I don't care about that stuff--

22:46.782 --> 22:48.533
I don't have time
to deal with this, okay?

22:48.617 --> 22:51.203
Just fix this. Go in there.
You can talk to her.

22:51.286 --> 22:53.580
Okay, let's go.
-Go. Go.

22:53.663 --> 22:56.124
No. Get off.
You're not getting on here.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.168
You got the cart, let's go.
We can get there faster.

22:58.251 --> 23:00.754
I got the cart so I can get a doughnut.
You are walking to her trailer.

23:00.837 --> 23:03.173
Okay, get your fucking doughnut then, man.

23:03.673 --> 23:04.925
Go get your doughnut.

23:06.927 --> 23:09.805
You changed the story of my life.

23:09.888 --> 23:13.016
You lied about what happened to me.
That's all fake.

23:13.100 --> 23:15.685
Okay, hold on.
-There is no "baby Greg."

23:15.769 --> 23:20.398
Okay, okay. I may have altered
a couple details. That's true.

23:20.482 --> 23:22.943
You said my husband and I
got back together.

23:23.026 --> 23:27.322
I made some adjustments,
both for clarity and brevity.

23:27.405 --> 23:30.700
I had to make a certain page count here

23:30.784 --> 23:33.453
and use it as a teaching tool.

23:33.537 --> 23:35.330
-You're a fraud, Colter.
-Okay.

23:35.413 --> 23:38.041
-Yeah, I did.

23:38.125 --> 23:41.044
And I would appreciate it
if you did call me "doctor,"

23:41.128 --> 23:44.297
because that's my legal stage name.
It has been for many years.

23:44.381 --> 23:47.676
You rewrote my life! My life is over!

23:47.759 --> 23:52.389
I'm divorced with children!
And my husband's fucking other women!

23:52.472 --> 23:55.767
Look, your husband
was not sexually satisfied,

23:55.851 --> 24:00.063
and I told him he needed to explore that
if this relationship was going to work.

24:00.147 --> 24:04.109
He is very satisfied!
I satisfy my husband!

24:04.192 --> 24:07.654
He was... We were very happy
in the bedroom!

24:07.737 --> 24:12.117
Well, satisfied husbands don't go
and fuck whores in Thailand,

24:12.200 --> 24:13.034
last time I checked!

24:13.118 --> 24:16.872
No, don't go. Please stay! Don't leave!
Don't leave! Don't leave. Um...

24:16.955 --> 24:18.832
-Oh, yeah.

24:18.915 --> 24:20.834
Shit. Okay.

24:20.917 --> 24:25.130
For those who are listening at home,
there was a deranged woman.

24:25.213 --> 24:28.258
We booted her crazy ass out of here.

24:28.341 --> 24:33.555
And we are seeking the proper help
to assist her

24:33.638 --> 24:36.558
in her... her... her...
her hopeful healing.

24:36.641 --> 24:40.187
-Yeah, I have a question.

24:40.270 --> 24:42.397
I really don't want to talk
about the book right now.

24:42.480 --> 24:46.526
Yeah, I don't think anybody in here
wants to talk about the book.

24:46.610 --> 24:47.944
Okay.

24:48.028 --> 24:50.906
My question is
what's hurting you right now, man?

24:50.989 --> 24:51.823
Yeah. Come on, man.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.869
It's okay, man.

25:13.220 --> 25:14.054
Hey, Arya.

25:16.973 --> 25:19.893
Look, uh... I'm sorry.
I know how you feel.

25:19.976 --> 25:21.061
You don't.

25:21.978 --> 25:23.230
No, I do. I...

25:23.813 --> 25:25.607
I know what it's like
to have my heart broken.

25:25.690 --> 25:29.778
I know what it's like to kiss somebody
who doesn't want to kiss you back.

25:29.861 --> 25:32.405
Well, I don't. I've never kissed anyone.

25:32.489 --> 25:35.992
What are you talking about?
You said you had boyfriends.

25:36.076 --> 25:37.035
Obviously, I lied.

25:37.118 --> 25:39.829
I don't have any friends.
I don't go to school.

25:39.913 --> 25:41.748
All the boys that know me,
they're scared of me,

25:41.831 --> 25:43.291
'cause I made seven figures.

25:46.461 --> 25:48.004
I'm sorry you're going through this.

25:49.422 --> 25:52.133
I just don't understand
why it has to be like this.

25:52.217 --> 25:55.011
Do you want to hear
an embarrassing story from my life

25:55.095 --> 25:56.638
that might make you feel better?

25:58.682 --> 26:05.230
Yeah, the first time I kissed a girl
was after I saw <i>The Truman Show.</i>

26:06.273 --> 26:08.817
And I cried so hard...

26:09.401 --> 26:12.070
that my date kissed me just
to make me feel better.

26:12.445 --> 26:13.738
That's ridiculous.

26:13.822 --> 26:16.574
She thought I was ridiculous, too.
The next day, she broke up with me.

26:17.158 --> 26:18.118
I don't blame her.

26:18.201 --> 26:19.869
That's not even a sad movie.

26:19.953 --> 26:21.162
I wasn't crying 'cause it was sad.

26:21.246 --> 26:23.206
I was crying about
the predicament Truman was in.

26:23.290 --> 26:24.833
The predicament was bullshit.

26:24.916 --> 26:27.877
There's cameras everywhere for 30 years
and he didn't see one.

26:29.129 --> 26:31.589
I think his predicament was that

26:31.673 --> 26:35.802
he spent his whole life on the set
of a TV show. I don't know if...

26:35.885 --> 26:38.179
maybe you can empathize with that.

26:38.763 --> 26:42.058
Well, now I can't do the scene.
I can't kiss someone that I hate.

26:42.142 --> 26:43.685
It's my first kiss!

26:43.768 --> 26:47.397
Arya, I'm not going to lie to you.
This situation sucks.

26:47.480 --> 26:51.651
Okay? It sucks.

26:52.777 --> 26:55.405
But you know what you can do
nobody else can?

26:56.531 --> 27:00.327
You can take all that sadness
and all that anger,

27:00.410 --> 27:02.245
and go out there and use it.

27:03.997 --> 27:05.623
And make gold.

27:09.252 --> 27:10.587
I don't even know.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.635
Believe in yourself, Arya.

27:17.719 --> 27:19.971
You got this.

27:20.055 --> 27:21.264
Stop.

27:22.724 --> 27:24.351
When it comes down to it,
I'm this...

27:25.852 --> 27:28.313
-lonely piece of shit...
Mm-hmm.

27:28.396 --> 27:31.316
sitting in a booth...

27:31.399 --> 27:37.530
just spouting out ego over the airwaves,
every second of the day.

27:37.614 --> 27:40.450
Just... "Listen to me! Listen to me!"

27:41.034 --> 27:44.537
-Your boyfriend really can talk a lot.
That's the whole thing.

27:44.621 --> 27:46.581
He's not my boyfriend.
Why would you say that?

27:46.664 --> 27:48.249
'Cause of the connection you have.

27:48.333 --> 27:51.086
We're colleagues. This is work for me.

27:51.169 --> 27:53.421
You're available?
Do you think we can be a couple?

27:53.505 --> 27:54.964
No, I have a boyfriend.

27:55.548 --> 27:57.550
That's clear. That is clear.

27:57.634 --> 27:59.928
You know what would help you?

28:01.179 --> 28:04.432
Start getting really, really honest
with yourself.

28:05.475 --> 28:07.477
I mean, really honest.

28:09.646 --> 28:13.316
I lied. I lied in my book

28:14.109 --> 28:16.694
because I didn't think
the truth was enough,

28:16.778 --> 28:18.780
because I didn't think I was enough.

28:18.863 --> 28:22.534
Even the blind kid story you told
that got partial vision back?

28:22.617 --> 28:23.868
He's dead.

28:23.952 --> 28:26.121
-Jesus Christ.
-Oh, wow.

28:26.204 --> 28:29.457
When I called those people
to see how they were doing,

28:29.541 --> 28:32.627
they were all significantly...

28:33.253 --> 28:35.630
more fucked up than they were...

28:37.924 --> 28:39.008
before.

28:39.592 --> 28:41.720
There it is. Let it come. Let it...

28:41.803 --> 28:43.555
-There's the healing.
-Healing's in the feelings, man.

28:43.638 --> 28:45.890
-There's your healing.
-Healing's in the feelings. Yeah.

28:45.974 --> 28:47.642
-He's doing really good.
-Yeah, he is.

28:48.643 --> 28:52.522
All right, Greg. So, if you stopped
giving advice altogether,

28:52.605 --> 28:55.608
you just stop doing
what you're doing, completely...

28:57.193 --> 28:58.194
who would you be?

28:58.278 --> 29:00.780
Wait, don't tell him
to stop giving advice.

29:00.864 --> 29:03.575
That's why I'm here.
I came down to ask my question.

29:03.658 --> 29:05.326
Dr. Greg, first-time caller.

29:05.410 --> 29:09.414
I got a question.
I have a hard time getting off.

29:09.998 --> 29:13.710
Unless a stranger
just punches me in the face.

29:13.793 --> 29:15.503
Is that wrong?

29:15.587 --> 29:19.340
And with that, it is time for us
to get back to the office.

29:20.425 --> 29:21.259
Come on, Dr. Greg.

29:21.342 --> 29:23.803
Thank you so much, all of you.
What a wonderful audience.

29:23.887 --> 29:26.222
And what a healing experience
this has proved to be.

29:26.306 --> 29:28.099
Scene mark.

29:36.608 --> 29:39.152
Okay, settle, settle, please.

29:41.404 --> 29:44.157
And... action!

29:46.993 --> 29:49.329
Listen, I didn't want to have to ask,
but I need your help.

29:49.412 --> 29:51.664
They're not gonna stop coming
unless we close this hell mouth.

29:51.748 --> 29:53.708
Unbelievable! You told me
to go home last night

29:53.792 --> 29:55.043
when you knew they were gonna attack.

29:55.126 --> 29:56.419
I wanted to protect you!

29:56.503 --> 29:58.963
Good. Great! You protected me.
Now nine of us are dead.

29:59.047 --> 30:01.216
Fine. Want to know the real reason?

30:01.299 --> 30:02.926
We don't have time for anything else.

30:03.009 --> 30:06.179
I'd rather lose nine of them
than one of you. Okay?

30:06.262 --> 30:07.305
What did you say?

30:08.515 --> 30:11.684
I can live without them,
but I can't live without you.

30:27.575 --> 30:31.412
-Well, I can live without you.

30:37.293 --> 30:38.753
Was that okay?

30:40.296 --> 30:41.130
Yeah.

30:41.214 --> 30:43.383
Fuck... Cut!

30:43.466 --> 30:44.300
Cutting.

30:46.344 --> 30:47.887
Jesus Christ.

30:49.806 --> 30:51.474
I'm so embarrassed.

30:52.392 --> 30:53.560
Don't be.

30:53.643 --> 30:56.145
Look, I'm no stranger to public meltdowns.

30:57.272 --> 30:59.607
People heard that on their radios.

31:01.734 --> 31:05.488
Yeah, but this is where
your low ratings actually serve you,

31:05.572 --> 31:07.866
because not that many people heard it.

31:09.492 --> 31:11.160
Bet you love this, don't you?

31:11.786 --> 31:14.455
Seeing me shattered
with my guts on the floor?

31:14.539 --> 31:19.627
Yeah, but just because it's made you
a little bit closer to a human being.

31:22.964 --> 31:25.174
Hey, someone bought your book.

31:27.218 --> 31:28.052
I appreciate it.

31:28.136 --> 31:30.430
Well, I charged it to the station.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.477
What are you gonna do with that?

31:37.687 --> 31:38.605
I don't know.

31:39.647 --> 31:43.526
Maybe Gus and I'll get jacked up
on caffeine and act out chapters.

31:46.654 --> 31:47.822
Sounds like fun.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.158
Oh, it will be.

31:57.957 --> 32:00.293
-I'm gonna go to sleep.
-Okay.

32:31.783 --> 32:34.160
-Hi.
-Hey. Hello.

32:39.374 --> 32:40.500
-Hey.
-Hi.

32:40.583 --> 32:42.502
Mmm. What's up?

32:42.585 --> 32:46.673
Well, Bertie and Randy went
to dinner and a movie.

32:46.756 --> 32:48.216
Oh! Which movie?

32:49.801 --> 32:50.927
No...

32:54.889 --> 32:56.849
Ah. I see.

33:03.815 --> 33:05.608
You know what?
We should fuck in this room.

33:05.692 --> 33:07.193
Let's fuck in every room.

33:12.031 --> 33:13.324
Oh, boy.

33:13.408 --> 33:16.119
We had sex in Bertie's room.

33:16.202 --> 33:19.622
I know. We're like two wolves,
marking their territory.

33:19.706 --> 33:21.666
Like, "This is ours. Stay away!"

33:21.749 --> 33:23.334
She's never gonna know.

33:23.418 --> 33:24.836
-That's the best part.
-I know.

33:24.919 --> 33:26.546
She'll never know.

33:29.215 --> 33:30.383
Crazy.

33:31.676 --> 33:33.302
How was it with Arya today?

33:33.386 --> 33:36.180
It was good.
I mean, it got a little crazy there.

33:36.264 --> 33:40.101
She wasn't coming out of her trailer.
Everybody was flipping out and...

33:40.935 --> 33:43.521
I don't know.
I went in there, and we talked,

33:43.604 --> 33:47.108
and then she went out and she killed it.

33:48.109 --> 33:50.028
-Yeah, she was awesome.

33:50.111 --> 33:51.904
And not just like child actor good,

33:51.988 --> 33:55.491
I mean, like, Jessica Chastain good.
Alicia Vikander good.

33:55.575 --> 33:57.118
Well, I love Chastain.

33:57.201 --> 33:58.286
She's the best.

33:59.746 --> 34:01.956
I don't know, it was cool.
Like, I went in there...

34:02.915 --> 34:06.961
and she was angry and sad.

34:07.045 --> 34:10.590
I said, "Just go out there
and turn it into art."

34:13.217 --> 34:14.343
Felt like I was directing.

34:14.427 --> 34:17.221
Yeah, of course you did.
'Cause you're good.

34:17.305 --> 34:20.808
-Mmm...
-You should just do it. Make your movie.

34:21.601 --> 34:24.896
Like the <i>Rear Window</i> thing?
-Yes!

34:24.979 --> 34:26.731
Look, you saved money...

34:26.814 --> 34:28.524
You've got friends that could help.

34:28.608 --> 34:31.235
Just call in every favor
and make the thing.

34:33.404 --> 34:35.531
That could be good.
I could do that. That'd be easy.

34:35.615 --> 34:36.824
Yeah! Look at me.

34:36.908 --> 34:38.826
I didn't think I could be a producer,
and I'm killing it.

34:39.410 --> 34:42.914
Yeah, I have to say, "I'm a director,"
and then I'm a director, so...

34:43.539 --> 34:46.084
-I'm a director. I can fucking do this.
-You're a director!

34:46.667 --> 34:48.127
Are you hard again?

34:48.211 --> 34:49.462
I already came again.

34:49.545 --> 34:51.464
Well, then, we're gonna fuck!

34:51.547 --> 34:56.469
