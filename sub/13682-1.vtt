WEBVTT

00:24.942 --> 00:26.068
So what happened?

00:27.361 --> 00:29.284
- There? Right there?
- Hm-mm. Yup.

00:34.159 --> 00:35.536
The scouting report.

00:36.703 --> 00:37.955
What was that report?

00:40.582 --> 00:43.301
That he's better than
most pitchers at the plate.

00:45.254 --> 00:47.968
Can't lay down a bunt,
can't throw it hard and inside,

00:48.048 --> 00:49.595
because he's got some bad speed.

00:49.675 --> 00:50.892
Ah.

00:52.052 --> 00:55.393
And instead of an easy out,
like you would have with most pitchers,

00:56.014 --> 00:57.607
you actually had to work for this one.

00:59.351 --> 01:02.025
Hm, maybe that was exasperating to you.

01:02.145 --> 01:07.158
After facing all these good hitters, you
don't even get an easy out with the pitcher.

01:12.239 --> 01:13.661
Is this what you do in here?

01:15.033 --> 01:18.708
I mean, is this... Is this what you do
with players, you review tape?

01:18.912 --> 01:20.209
Is this what we are gonna do all week?

01:20.497 --> 01:23.000
My instructions were to calm you down
for the playoffs.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.552
Yeah, so are we gonna
just watch a tape or...

01:25.919 --> 01:27.717
No, that's what we are doing now.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.883
Tomorrow, it'll be different.

01:31.133 --> 01:32.259
Is that okay with you, man?

01:32.342 --> 01:33.343
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:33.427 --> 01:34.673
Yeah, you are the Coach.

01:34.753 --> 01:35.754
Okay.

01:36.263 --> 01:37.264
Ah.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.517
You remember anything else specific?

01:40.726 --> 01:42.940
Yeah, I remember I'm about to throw
five wild pitches and

01:43.020 --> 01:45.364
make a fucking ass out of myself
in front of the entire world.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.732
Yeah, I remember that.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.192
Oh, I got that.

01:49.818 --> 01:54.498
But do you remember what you were thinking,
and what you felt in this moment?

01:57.492 --> 01:58.914
Um...

02:03.874 --> 02:09.631
I, I heard this guy in the crowd,

02:09.713 --> 02:11.465
he was a vendor. I heard him yell "Coke."

02:14.009 --> 02:15.010
You ever do coke?

02:19.306 --> 02:20.307
No.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.318
What kind of a question is that?

02:24.603 --> 02:25.695
Just flowing with it.

02:28.231 --> 02:32.532
Just keeping it loose... All right,
let's stick with this, uh, soda guy.

02:32.778 --> 02:35.122
That must have been pretty loud
for you to hear it over the crowd.

02:35.238 --> 02:38.617
Yeah, but when I'm focused,
whenever I'm... you know,

02:39.701 --> 02:42.955
I don't even hear the guy next to me.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.048
He could be saying something
and I won't even hear him.

02:45.916 --> 02:48.922
But right before this pitch,
I remember I heard the Coke guy,

02:49.002 --> 02:51.846
I heard little noises in the crowd.

02:52.047 --> 02:57.390
Sandy Koufax said when he lost focus,
he would see the crowd, not the catcher.

02:58.220 --> 02:59.597
- Koufax said that?
- Uh-huh.

02:59.805 --> 03:00.806
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.562
You are not the first pitcher
to have this problem, you know, man.

03:03.642 --> 03:06.278
- Yeah, I know, Howard Glass.
- You're not so special.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.815
- I know Howard Glass had this, right?
- Mm.

03:09.898 --> 03:13.071
And he started throwing, he threw strikes.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.654
Woke up one day, couldn't throw
any strikes, never threw again.

03:15.737 --> 03:18.285
Ah, a lot of pitchers struggle
with control when they are young.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.366
Yeah.

03:19.991 --> 03:22.331
Hey, he killed himself, right?
He hung himself.

03:22.411 --> 03:24.163
- Hm-mm.
- You didn't work with him, did you?

03:24.246 --> 03:25.418
No, not really.

03:25.664 --> 03:26.665
Yeah.

03:27.999 --> 03:29.296
Is there a name for what he had?

03:30.419 --> 03:34.135
Yeah, there's plenty of names
but I don't subscribe to any of those.

03:35.757 --> 03:36.758
Why not?

03:37.217 --> 03:38.844
Don't want to legitimize it.

03:40.429 --> 03:42.102
This is a passing thing for you.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.568
And you give it a name,
it might wanna stick around.

03:50.355 --> 03:51.732
- Yeah?
- Mm.

03:52.357 --> 03:53.358
Mm-hm.

03:54.443 --> 03:55.569
All right.

03:56.236 --> 03:59.365
Well, I think we are about
out of time for today.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.367
Do you have any other question
you want to ask me, though?

04:07.914 --> 04:09.791
Do you prescribe medication in here?

04:11.168 --> 04:12.669
What's the problem?

04:16.635 --> 04:18.175
I, uh...

04:19.676 --> 04:21.474
I haven't slept in like three days.

04:22.721 --> 04:25.435
I don't sleep so good,
you know. I mean I can,

04:25.515 --> 04:31.988
but I have these bad dreams, so I don't.
Need something to knock me out maybe.

04:32.731 --> 04:35.780
Let's try and see if we can handle that
without meds for now.

04:36.777 --> 04:37.778
- Okay.
- Okay?

04:37.861 --> 04:39.078
All right. Fine.

04:39.863 --> 04:41.865
Also, I'll tell you my memory
is a little bit foggy.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.325
I don't remember things so well.

04:44.159 --> 04:46.457
Um, you know.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.331
Memory is a funny business.

04:50.707 --> 04:53.961
And sometimes we fog over the past,

04:54.920 --> 04:56.046
because of damage.

04:58.924 --> 05:02.594
You know, like in the old movies when
they put Vaseline on the camera lens

05:02.677 --> 05:05.647
to make the faces prettier
and softer, you know?

05:05.931 --> 05:09.604
Yeah, I'm not damaged.
I mean I'm not damaged at all.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.482
Some things I remember very clearly.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.522
- You know?
- Okay.

05:13.605 --> 05:15.323
- But some things I don't.
- Okay.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.441
Yeah.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.662
This is a kid who comes into
the game with six wins, no losses,

06:49.200 --> 06:51.703
a 2.03 ERA.

06:51.828 --> 06:56.378
A terrific strikeout to walk ratio which
makes what happened all the more strange.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.751
Well, yeah.

06:57.959 --> 07:00.882
We have to be a little concerned
with the rookie at this point, anyway.

07:00.962 --> 07:03.465
I mean, throwing five wild pitches

07:03.590 --> 07:06.719
in one inning,
on national television to boot.

07:07.052 --> 07:08.890
You know he must be in a state of shock.

07:08.970 --> 07:12.644
I mean, this is a kid who's never had
any control issues at all.

07:12.724 --> 07:14.442
You are absolutely right about that.

07:14.559 --> 07:18.817
The kid is known for pinpoint accuracy
and well, frankly, a fast bowler

07:18.897 --> 07:20.240
that the Gods would be jealous of.

07:20.357 --> 07:24.194
The Gods being Nolan Ryan and,
Walter "The Big Train" Johnson.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.871
You know, I hope the kid's okay.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.160
Hopper, Rachel Cullum with Sport Net.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.708
Could you tell us what happened out there?

07:31.159 --> 07:32.760
Hopper, right here.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.140
That agent who wants to rep you, Scott...

08:33.221 --> 08:35.019
- Hm-mm.
- He sent me his portfolio of the house.

08:35.140 --> 08:37.437
He thinks I should move in,
five miles from Jensen Beach.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.190
I asked him to do that. What do you think?

08:41.604 --> 08:44.073
I can't believe it. It's a fucking castle.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.442
Well, believe it, Mom, 'cause it's yours.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.327
Just in your name, just for you.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.039
Castle makes me nervous, Hop.

08:51.156 --> 08:53.705
Don't be nervous,
just enjoy it. Look at this.

08:53.992 --> 08:55.494
Look at that pool.

08:55.577 --> 08:56.874
You like swimming, right?

08:56.995 --> 08:58.622
No, you like swimming.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.253
Ever since you saw The Little Mermaid.

09:01.849 --> 09:03.380
I'm scared of sharks.

09:03.460 --> 09:06.054
- Sharks in the pool, really?
- At night, yeah.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.598
I'm always terrified
there's gonna be sharks in a dark pool.

09:09.007 --> 09:11.429
- I know it's not likely.
- It's not likely at all.

09:11.509 --> 09:13.807
But you know what?
You can just turn the pool lights on.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.104
There's lights all over it.

09:16.306 --> 09:17.307
Mom.

09:18.683 --> 09:19.684
Just enjoy it.

09:19.934 --> 09:22.028
I'll try, Hop. I really will try.

09:22.937 --> 09:24.150
It's a mansion though, right?

09:24.230 --> 09:26.227
- Yeah.
- It's a fucking mansion.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.277
You like it?

09:29.819 --> 09:31.742
Yeah, they cut the lawn so nice, too.

10:04.062 --> 10:06.440
You think your baseball coach
is going to get you out of this?

10:07.065 --> 10:08.612
- No, ma'am.
- Good.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.151
'Cause he's not.

10:10.985 --> 10:12.282
I don't play by those rules.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.992
I don't care if you are the big jock
around here,

10:14.072 --> 10:16.074
you still have to study
when it comes to my class.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.367
Yes, ma'am.

10:18.034 --> 10:22.835
I know those big league scouts
are all over the place. I see them.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.420
You'll have more money in a year from now

10:25.500 --> 10:29.630
than I'll have in... all my lifetimes.

10:31.047 --> 10:34.972
But you and I both know
that does not change one undeniable fact.

10:37.178 --> 10:38.179
Ma'am?

10:40.140 --> 10:41.562
You know I know your daddy?

10:44.602 --> 10:45.603
You do?

10:47.605 --> 10:50.529
We were at school here, together.

10:54.644 --> 10:57.048
He was a real piece of work.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.413
An expert at cutting corners.

11:00.493 --> 11:03.587
When there weren't any corners left,
he'd make circles around her.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.503
I was hoping
he hadn't taught you that trick.

11:11.671 --> 11:16.721
Well, I'm not trying to make excuses,
Ms. Epland, but sometimes, I find it

11:16.801 --> 11:20.055
a little difficult to balance
baseball and homework.

11:25.268 --> 11:26.269
Now, you listen to me.

11:28.146 --> 11:31.366
When you're gifted
with a talent like you are,

11:32.859 --> 11:36.370
people will say,
"Wow, that's pretty nifty."

11:37.071 --> 11:39.699
And they'll tell you honestly
that it can change your life,

11:39.824 --> 11:42.293
lead you to inconceivable realms.

11:43.786 --> 11:48.383
But you have to work at bringing
the rest of your person up to that level.

11:50.335 --> 11:52.963
If you only do what comes easy to you,
what you are good at,

11:53.630 --> 11:58.264
you are just an untrained thoroughbred,
which isn't a race horse, at all.

11:58.927 --> 12:00.270
It's a wild animal.

12:02.931 --> 12:05.684
I'm using sports metaphor
so that you can understand,

12:06.935 --> 12:07.936
Junior.

12:30.333 --> 12:32.210
Yo, what's up, Hopper?

12:41.803 --> 12:43.474
Uh, Dorothy was telling us

12:43.554 --> 12:48.902
that you are trying to decide
between college and being a professional.

12:50.311 --> 12:51.312
Yeah.

12:54.190 --> 12:58.031
I know my college education
is important, but at the same time...

12:58.111 --> 12:59.112
Mm, nonsense.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.952
I mean, when those colleges
start giving kids a share

13:03.032 --> 13:05.160
of all the money they are making
off of them, then maybe.

13:05.243 --> 13:06.664
But as it is, it's absurd.

13:06.744 --> 13:09.588
I mean, the NCAA's completely corrupt.

13:10.164 --> 13:11.757
Who's that guy, at Duke?

13:12.500 --> 13:14.798
The one at Duke that they are paying
ten million dollars a year

13:14.919 --> 13:16.090
to coach a basketball team.

13:16.170 --> 13:17.467
Coach K, absolutely.

13:17.672 --> 13:19.344
Yeah, these coaches
making a million dollars

13:19.424 --> 13:21.097
while the players get nothing,
it should be illegal.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.264
And so should the Major League drafts.

13:23.344 --> 13:24.812
All drafts should be illegal.

13:25.888 --> 13:26.976
You want to sign with the Yankees,

13:27.056 --> 13:28.808
you should be able to sign with Yankees,
don't you think?

13:29.392 --> 13:31.144
I've never really thought about it before.

13:31.519 --> 13:33.021
All drafts should be illegal.

13:36.899 --> 13:39.527
I don't think Yankees
would be my first pick.

13:39.736 --> 13:40.737
Why not?

13:42.238 --> 13:44.866
Well, you know, New York.

13:46.117 --> 13:48.836
All those people, all that money.

13:49.370 --> 13:50.622
Isn't money important to you?

13:51.372 --> 13:55.631
Yeah, money is important to me but,
only enough to take care of my mom

13:55.752 --> 13:58.255
and I don't have to put up
with those Steinbrenner kids.

14:00.048 --> 14:01.174
Talk to the socialist.

14:03.593 --> 14:04.765
What's a socialist?

14:05.511 --> 14:09.607
It's a person who believes in a system
where there's no private property.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.852
Oh, that's not me. No.

14:11.934 --> 14:14.532
I want to buy my mom a house.

14:14.912 --> 14:16.164
Of course.

14:16.647 --> 14:18.486
You're still a ball player, after all.

14:18.566 --> 14:21.285
I mean you couldn't throw all those
strikes if you were a complete Marxist.

14:22.945 --> 14:23.946
Exactly.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.374
When I grew up, athletes were political.

14:26.741 --> 14:28.288
They wanted to be like Muhammad Ali.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.628
Nowadays, they want to be
like Michael Jordon.

14:31.162 --> 14:34.757
Hollow billionaire. They're capitalists.
No heart or love in what they do.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.093
LeBron went back to Cleveland.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.504
There was love in that move. Kevin Love.

14:40.004 --> 14:41.472
Ba-dum-bum-tssh.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.889
Did I tell you the one
about the polar bear and rabbit?

14:46.969 --> 14:48.812
- Oh, the polar bear and the rabbi?
- Rabbit.

14:48.930 --> 14:52.309
Uh, uh, hold it. LeBron,
are you ready for dessert?

14:53.059 --> 14:55.027
I just called you LeBron, didn't I?

14:56.938 --> 14:58.030
Because I love the game.

14:58.272 --> 15:00.274
Oh, Hopper, are you ready for dessert?

15:00.358 --> 15:04.237
No, you can call me LeBron.
You can call me LeBron. I like it.

15:05.363 --> 15:07.081
My parents, they loved you.

15:09.158 --> 15:10.159
Really?

15:11.035 --> 15:13.663
I'm not used to talking like that
at dinner at all.

15:13.746 --> 15:14.747
Yeah?

15:15.123 --> 15:18.423
- What's it like at your house?
- My house? At dinner?

15:21.421 --> 15:23.048
I always sit in front of the TV.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.551
We eat, we don't really say anything.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.305
My mom works all the time.

15:27.385 --> 15:29.012
She is in real estate. My dad he's...

15:30.763 --> 15:31.764
He's away.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.477
Your family is so smart.

15:36.978 --> 15:38.025
You're smart.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.859
You're going to be a valedictorian.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.657
You got all the Chinese kids beat.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.903
I'm just good at studying, that's all.

15:45.153 --> 15:46.905
I'm terrible at studying.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.615
My Mom says I have ADD.

15:49.490 --> 15:51.458
How do you focus when you're on the mound?

15:54.412 --> 15:55.834
I just forget about everything.

17:11.446 --> 17:12.949
Hopper, come on in for a second.

17:15.242 --> 17:17.665
- Sunflower seed?
- No, thank you.

17:22.250 --> 17:23.593
How is the change up coming along?

17:24.585 --> 17:27.680
Mm-mm. I don't know. Sometimes,
I think I'm getting it, and then...

17:28.464 --> 17:29.465
Yeah.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.014
There's not really anything to get.

17:33.678 --> 17:35.266
You just can't blow up, you know.

17:35.346 --> 17:36.518
Yeah, I guess.

17:38.015 --> 17:39.608
I heard your dad's coming back this week.

17:41.519 --> 17:42.520
Yup.

17:45.523 --> 17:46.900
Is that what you wanted
to talk to me about?

17:48.192 --> 17:49.944
Is he going to stay with you and your mom?

17:50.027 --> 17:51.028
Yeah, I think so.

17:51.112 --> 17:53.740
- How do you feel about him coming back?
- I feel great about it.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.208
- Real fucking cocksucker.
- Yeah.

18:01.622 --> 18:03.750
My dad rides me pretty damn hard.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.418
I know he does.

18:08.462 --> 18:09.839
He rides me hard too.

18:10.131 --> 18:12.053
He tells me all the time
not to watch the pitch count,

18:12.133 --> 18:13.350
'cause it's going to make you soft.

18:13.509 --> 18:14.556
A dime a dozen.

18:14.885 --> 18:16.907
He's a piece of work, your pop.

18:17.712 --> 18:19.881
Yeah, he thinks you are...

18:19.974 --> 18:24.188
he thinks you're slow too because you didn't
take that third base Coaching gig at FSU.

18:26.230 --> 18:27.857
- That's what he said?
- That's what he said.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.535
You are doing really good.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.121
- Yeah.
- Staying out of trouble.

18:34.238 --> 18:35.535
I'm trying really hard.

18:36.991 --> 18:39.995
And I like Dorothy. That's a good girl.

18:40.703 --> 18:42.250
- Yeah.
- She's got sturdy head over her shoulders.

18:42.330 --> 18:44.794
It seems to me you've been
in the pink since you been with her.

18:44.874 --> 18:48.047
A lot better than with the last one,
I forgot her name right now.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.344
I think it was another "D" name.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.802
- Doreen.
- Doreen.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.017
Any girl going to math class,

18:55.968 --> 19:00.064
puts on that much mascara,
she does not like herself very much.

19:01.056 --> 19:04.982
Anybody puts on that kind of mask,
they unintentionally expose themselves.

19:07.396 --> 19:09.273
Are you listening? I can't tell with you
if you are listening.

19:09.357 --> 19:10.403
I'm listening.

19:10.483 --> 19:11.951
- Are you?
- Yeah, yeah.

19:20.951 --> 19:22.248
This is bananas.

19:23.788 --> 19:25.381
I think your mom took that picture.

19:26.749 --> 19:28.046
High school yearbook.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.881
I was the yearbook editor.

19:31.587 --> 19:34.181
I found that last night,
going through the garage.

19:36.008 --> 19:39.262
He was a really gifted player,
could have gone pro.

19:41.472 --> 19:42.473
You think?

19:44.392 --> 19:46.360
You know, he hit a lot of doubles,
that's what he says.

19:46.644 --> 19:47.691
He's a doubles hitter.

19:47.937 --> 19:48.938
Doubles?

19:49.647 --> 19:51.149
Double vodka, double soda.

19:53.609 --> 19:57.113
Senior year, he started showing up
to practice late and tired and high,

19:57.363 --> 20:00.161
new tattoos all the time,
and then by the end of the season,

20:00.241 --> 20:02.289
he just simply wasn't showing up at all.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.457
He said he got...

20:05.830 --> 20:07.457
kicked off the team for brawling.

20:08.082 --> 20:11.336
There was a bad brawl,
but he never got kicked off the team.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.799
In fact, I remember
the coaches actually liked

20:15.881 --> 20:17.845
that he threw punches in the brawl,
because it's the only time

20:17.925 --> 20:21.054
they'd seen him with any pep all year.

20:26.767 --> 20:28.394
Little did we know that was it.
That was it.

20:28.477 --> 20:31.151
That would be his pastime
from then on, fracas.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.158
I got to go, Coach.
Dorothy is waiting for me.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.239
Look at me.

20:41.699 --> 20:42.996
Be astute.

20:45.578 --> 20:49.260
If late at night,
trouble comes knocking...

20:49.540 --> 20:53.669
at your door, do yourself
a favor, stay in bed.

20:54.462 --> 20:55.463
Yeah.

20:57.798 --> 20:59.015
Go say hi to Dorothy.

21:00.468 --> 21:01.970
So, I have another joke.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.271
I went to the zoo the other day.

21:04.722 --> 21:05.939
But there was only a dog.

21:06.599 --> 21:07.896
It was a Shih Tzu.

21:08.017 --> 21:09.860
Why do you like mayonnaise on your fries?

21:10.853 --> 21:14.482
- Try it, you might like it.
- Mm, no, I'll take my chances.

21:14.565 --> 21:16.238
You never take the chance.

21:16.692 --> 21:21.031
Whenever we go out, you always sit
in the corner, with your back to the wall,

21:21.155 --> 21:22.827
like you are afraid of your own shadow.

21:22.907 --> 21:25.456
Like the Nutcracker cornered
by the Mouse King.

21:25.826 --> 21:28.124
It's the best spot.
You can see everything coming.

21:29.838 --> 21:33.088
If there's a scout over there,
spying on me, then I know it.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.840
And if there's any trouble coming,
I know it.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.639
But, then you never get surprised.

21:39.673 --> 21:41.801
Yeah, well, surprises are overrated.

21:41.926 --> 21:42.927
Hi, y'all.

21:47.515 --> 21:48.516
So...

21:48.599 --> 21:49.600
Hey.

21:49.683 --> 21:50.855
What did Coach have to say?

21:53.896 --> 21:55.614
Why do you care what my coach had to say?

21:56.023 --> 21:57.866
Because I care about you.

22:03.447 --> 22:06.200
Do you have any idea how much
pressure I am under right now?

22:07.117 --> 22:08.539
I'm only trying to help.

22:08.661 --> 22:11.164
I know, but, I mean,

22:12.206 --> 22:15.801
I'm the number three ranked prospect
in the country.

22:16.043 --> 22:17.215
Number one pitcher.

22:18.170 --> 22:21.299
You have any idea what kind
of pressure that is?

22:23.717 --> 22:29.182
Well, who do you think has the best
grade point average in the school?

22:29.306 --> 22:31.274
There is not nearly as much as rivalry.

22:31.392 --> 22:35.065
Yeah, but if I want to go to a great
college, then I need to get a scholarship.

22:35.145 --> 22:36.772
I'm talking about
millions and millions of dollars.

22:36.856 --> 22:39.908
I'm talking about being famous. I'm talking
about being a professional athlete.

22:42.236 --> 22:45.084
You know that a Shih Tzu
is a toy dog, right?

22:45.164 --> 22:49.001
- What are you talking about?
- Shih Tzu and a shit zoo.

22:49.493 --> 22:52.205
- Come on.
- And you are telling jokes right now?

22:52.288 --> 22:54.585
- Come now, Hooper, it's only baseball.
- I just...

22:54.665 --> 22:56.963
That's the dumbest thing you've ever said.

22:59.086 --> 23:00.383
It's not just baseball.

23:03.257 --> 23:06.636
You know what? I wanna go home.
You're hurting my feelings.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.225
You really need to toughen up.

23:11.348 --> 23:12.975
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you do.

23:13.767 --> 23:16.357
No, I don't need to toughen up,
because that's a stupid goal.

23:16.437 --> 23:17.529
Survival of the fittest.

23:17.646 --> 23:19.819
Yeah, it's called Social Darwinism.

23:19.940 --> 23:24.031
And you are scared that if you can't
throw a ball perfectly, then you...

23:24.111 --> 23:25.704
And you think everybody's nice.

23:25.821 --> 23:27.744
Okay, well, that's not how it works.

23:28.073 --> 23:30.792
Everybody is using everybody
all the time. Period.

23:31.160 --> 23:33.288
- You using me?
- Yes, I'm using you.

23:33.370 --> 23:35.748
Of course, I'm using you.
You're using me. That's how it works.

23:35.831 --> 23:38.710
You are a cute little odd ball
that I pass my time with.

23:42.338 --> 23:45.808
You think because
you can throw a baseball,

23:46.216 --> 23:51.313
that you are special
in some kind of real/non-secular way.

23:51.639 --> 23:53.812
- Non-secular, what do you mean by that?
- Well, it doesn't.

23:55.768 --> 23:59.193
Worshiping these false American idols,

23:59.647 --> 24:02.525
and people just buying into
this Harry Potter Syndrome,

24:02.608 --> 24:05.031
like wanting to have a fucking
lightning bolt on their forehead,

24:05.152 --> 24:06.495
do you really believe in any of that?

24:06.737 --> 24:09.410
Because nobody is more special
than anybody else.

24:09.490 --> 24:11.743
I mean like, duh and...

24:15.537 --> 24:17.289
You know what? I really wanna go.

24:42.356 --> 24:43.357
How's your arm?

24:52.241 --> 24:53.242
It's fine.

24:56.578 --> 24:57.955
Got some new ink.

24:58.247 --> 24:59.294
Yeah, I was bored.

25:02.042 --> 25:03.794
Must have hurt getting it that dark, huh?

25:04.712 --> 25:05.883
Pain is just weakness...

25:05.963 --> 25:07.556
...leaving the body, yeah, I know.

25:10.134 --> 25:11.260
Have you grown at all?

25:12.344 --> 25:15.181
I don't think you've grown even a little
bit in the year since I've seen you.

25:18.475 --> 25:19.522
Inch and a half.

25:19.685 --> 25:22.279
You haven't grown
an inch and a half. Bullshit.

25:23.313 --> 25:26.317
Look at you. You're thin like a reed.
You don't have any muscle on you at all.

25:27.359 --> 25:31.159
You know the market's got
the undetectable steroids again.

25:31.572 --> 25:32.869
You might wanna check that out.

25:34.533 --> 25:39.084
How's... How's the great Coach Eddie, huh?

25:40.247 --> 25:43.459
He still think he's got all the answers
'cause he had a cup of coffee at the Majors?

25:44.668 --> 25:46.757
Hm? Didn't have what it takes to stick

25:46.837 --> 25:49.181
so he's been sticking it
to everybody else since, right?

25:50.382 --> 25:51.599
He had what it takes.

25:52.301 --> 25:54.474
Batted 307 before he got injured.

25:55.512 --> 25:57.514
Yeah. Running into a wall.

25:58.599 --> 26:00.272
That's a brainy baby for ya.

26:00.392 --> 26:03.020
Now he's got a job working in a school,
getting paid diddly squat.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.440
That's a loser's game.

26:05.522 --> 26:07.365
And he plays it 'cause he likes losing.

26:08.317 --> 26:09.318
Like the...

26:09.985 --> 26:12.909
freaks on the block who get their kicks

26:13.489 --> 26:15.992
while getting banged around.
No, thank you.

26:19.495 --> 26:20.916
You tell him I say hi.

26:20.996 --> 26:22.248
All right, fine.

26:26.835 --> 26:28.428
Well, you got here just in time.

26:29.880 --> 26:30.927
Who's playing?

26:31.131 --> 26:33.509
Fuck that. You got here
just in time to get me a beer.

26:33.842 --> 26:34.843
Take the edge off.

26:35.928 --> 26:36.929
Appreciate it.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.859
- Is Mom home?
- Why, you wanna cry to her?

26:50.400 --> 26:53.825
No, just wondering
if she got home from work yet.

26:55.197 --> 26:56.410
- You know.
- Hey, sit down.

26:56.490 --> 26:57.491
No, I got homework.

26:57.574 --> 27:00.703
No! I know you don't have
any homework, little liar face.

27:01.078 --> 27:03.046
Huh, you don't have the
brains for homework.

27:03.163 --> 27:05.507
Get your ass, your scrawny ass
to sit down on the couch.

27:05.707 --> 27:07.425
You don't have any homework, hey.

27:07.793 --> 27:10.672
You actually want to make me stand up

27:10.754 --> 27:13.343
and come over there
and sit your scrawny ass down.

27:13.423 --> 27:15.801
Is that what you want?
I don't think so, Slim.

27:22.558 --> 27:27.487
I can't believe all these scouts are buzzing
around a little toothpick like you.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.818
I mean that is full blown
craziness right there.

27:29.898 --> 27:31.696
I threw 98 miles an hour on Saturday.

27:31.984 --> 27:34.658
- Did you throw 98 miles an hour?
- Ninety-eight miles an hour.

27:36.505 --> 27:39.048
Wow, you must think
you're pretty astonishing.

27:42.286 --> 27:43.287
Huh?

27:45.664 --> 27:48.292
- You can tell me. It's all right.
- No, sir.

27:48.417 --> 27:50.130
- Well, come on, you can tell me.
- No, sir.

27:50.210 --> 27:51.211
It will be our secret.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.173
You think you're pretty astonishing, right?

27:54.256 --> 27:55.257
No, sir.

27:55.340 --> 27:57.138
- You do.
- I don't think I'm astonishing.

27:57.551 --> 27:59.645
- You think you are astonishing.
- No, sir.

28:00.137 --> 28:01.514
Yep, listen.

28:04.683 --> 28:10.857
Everything that you've accomplished,
you owe to me, right. You know that.

28:14.443 --> 28:15.444
Yes, sir.

28:16.737 --> 28:19.661
Don't "yes, sir" me, all right?
That pisses me off.

28:20.365 --> 28:21.366
Don't do that.

28:27.247 --> 28:29.670
I saw you smile at that game on Saturday.

28:36.924 --> 28:38.551
I don't think I was smiling.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.894
Uh, I saw you.

28:41.929 --> 28:44.102
In the photo, in the newspaper.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.813
You are standing on the mound, smiling.

28:49.102 --> 28:50.854
So, what happens when you break a rule?

28:51.438 --> 28:53.315
Hm? What's rule number one?

28:56.735 --> 28:58.533
Never show emotion on the mound.

28:59.112 --> 29:00.204
Hm-mm.

29:00.822 --> 29:04.952
And what do we do
when you break a rule during a game?

29:06.870 --> 29:07.871
What do we do?

29:09.665 --> 29:10.882
What the fuck!

29:13.543 --> 29:15.545
Huh? What do we do?

29:17.965 --> 29:19.592
Huh? What do we do?

29:20.175 --> 29:21.346
We run wind sprints.

29:21.426 --> 29:23.428
That's right.
Now get your ass outside, come on.

29:23.929 --> 29:26.273
Please don't make me chase you.
Come on, go!

29:27.975 --> 29:28.976
Go!

29:31.311 --> 29:33.860
Come on, man,
this is a suicide, not a jog.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.487
Don't make me get up and chase you.

29:36.608 --> 29:38.197
Don't make me get up and chase you!

29:38.277 --> 29:40.746
Do not make me get up and chase you!

29:40.904 --> 29:41.905
Go! Go!

29:41.989 --> 29:44.617
Look, man, I'm old
and I'm faster than you, motherfucker!

29:46.368 --> 29:47.540
Come on, now!

29:53.208 --> 29:54.209
That's better.

29:55.377 --> 29:56.879
What are you boys doing out here?

29:57.254 --> 29:59.507
- Oh, nothing.
- What's going on out here?

29:59.715 --> 30:02.264
Get inside, don't disobey me.
It ain't worth it.

30:02.426 --> 30:03.427
Hey, there.

30:03.510 --> 30:05.353
- What's going on out here?
- Nothing.

30:09.599 --> 30:10.600
Where's he going?

30:10.892 --> 30:11.893
He didn't even say hello.

30:11.977 --> 30:14.025
Well, boys got no manners,
what'd you expect?

30:14.146 --> 30:16.611
Shut the fuck up.
What were you doing to him out here?

30:18.358 --> 30:19.826
What were you doing to him out here?

30:20.694 --> 30:24.494
Junior and me have rules.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.784
And I was remembering them to him.

30:27.034 --> 30:28.035
Suicides?

30:28.618 --> 30:31.792
The rules don't concern you, Susan.
It ain't your concern.

30:32.748 --> 30:33.749
Okay.

30:35.292 --> 30:37.340
Don't come back here
trying to make things the way they were.

30:37.627 --> 30:42.015
Me and Hop have a certain way of doing
things now and it doesn't include suicides.

30:42.382 --> 30:45.030
You've to get accustomed to that,
you hear me?

30:46.511 --> 30:47.979
What? Come here.

30:49.806 --> 30:50.807
Come here.

30:52.768 --> 30:53.769
Hey, hey.

30:56.772 --> 30:57.773
You know what?

30:58.732 --> 31:00.655
We're doing dandy without you.

31:01.318 --> 31:04.288
So you can either get with the docket
or you can get out.

31:05.030 --> 31:08.159
Susan, you're starting to sound
a lot like my warden, Hal,

31:08.575 --> 31:11.249
and even a little bit more
like my parole officer, Neal.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.839
He'll be all right. Come here.

31:14.164 --> 31:17.994
You have any love for your Daddy? Any love?

31:19.503 --> 31:22.572
You're gonna have to
earn it this time, Daddy.

31:24.007 --> 31:27.219
All right, Susan.
I'm still your fucking husband, right?

31:27.677 --> 31:31.644
I have been getting a lot of the bullshit
whiny card, none of the soft stuff.

31:33.016 --> 31:35.314
Whole fucking world getting Topsy turvy.

31:37.370 --> 31:38.371
Shit.

31:43.819 --> 31:44.820
Hm-mm.

31:45.487 --> 31:48.988
Time, the great destroyer.

32:23.942 --> 32:24.943
Hey.

32:28.363 --> 32:30.450
You want to be the best?

32:33.034 --> 32:34.035
Huh?

32:35.495 --> 32:36.542
What time is it?

32:37.456 --> 32:38.753
Do you want to be the best?

32:39.332 --> 32:41.255
- Yeah, sure.
- All right then.

32:42.335 --> 32:43.836
The time is now.

32:43.970 --> 32:45.171
Get up.

32:46.391 --> 32:49.046
Yeah, what time is it, seriously?

32:49.134 --> 32:51.228
It's 3:30 am, it's time to jog.

32:51.344 --> 32:53.517
- I've school in three hours.
- Wake up, dude.

32:54.723 --> 32:56.066
I'm not gonna ask you again.

32:56.892 --> 32:59.771
Okay? I'm tryin' to teach you
about greatness.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.902
I know you're pissed at me, all right?

33:03.482 --> 33:05.029
But let me tell you something right now.

33:05.150 --> 33:06.447
We are winning.

33:06.776 --> 33:07.868
You hear me?

33:08.320 --> 33:12.245
Only me, you and the ghosts
of the legends up at this hour.

33:13.783 --> 33:15.626
One of these days,
you're going to be rich.

33:15.744 --> 33:18.497
You are going to be in some fancy hotel.

33:19.039 --> 33:21.711
Two Egyptian princesses
are going to be fighting over

33:21.791 --> 33:23.509
which one gets to suck your cock first.

33:23.960 --> 33:26.088
You're gonna lean back, you're gonna
look at the ceiling and think,

33:26.171 --> 33:28.424
"Goddamn, I love my dad."

33:28.798 --> 33:30.471
Huh? You hear me, son?

33:31.092 --> 33:33.094
You're gonna put your head on the pillow,

33:33.303 --> 33:36.056
close your eyes,
your dreams will line up just right.

33:36.723 --> 33:39.351
I shit you not, son,
we are winning right now.

34:02.916 --> 34:04.543
All right, that's good. That's good.

34:06.086 --> 34:07.679
Take off your gear
and go catch some grounders.

34:14.177 --> 34:15.554
Something bothering you, Hopper?

34:16.012 --> 34:17.013
Just tired, Coach.

34:23.603 --> 34:24.603
What happened to your head?

34:26.940 --> 34:28.317
Ah, it's nothing, Coach.

35:13.570 --> 35:16.198
So where is Hopper Gibson now?

35:16.781 --> 35:21.666
He is not with the Triple-A Minor League club
as he had been for the most of the season.

35:22.370 --> 35:24.498
He is not on the injured list.

35:24.706 --> 35:27.420
When I asked Atlanta's GM,
David Foreman, where Gibson was,

35:27.500 --> 35:31.346
Foreman would only say that Gibson
was taking care of a personal situation

35:31.463 --> 35:33.677
and would rejoin the club shortly.

35:33.757 --> 35:34.883
Thank you, Rachel.

35:34.966 --> 35:38.015
Who knows what darkness lurks
in the heart of a man? His shadow knows.

35:38.428 --> 35:41.181
Here's how Hopper Gibson's stats
compare with Howard Glass.

35:41.348 --> 35:43.476
Their numbers are eerily similar:

35:47.312 --> 35:50.031
When you first came into the public eye,

35:50.899 --> 35:51.900
uh...

35:53.777 --> 35:57.031
why did you say your dad was
a fisherman to Sports Illustrated?

35:58.740 --> 36:00.742
Because it's none of their business.

36:07.916 --> 36:09.379
I mean, what am I supposed to do?

36:09.459 --> 36:12.713
Am I supposed to air my dirty laundry
in front of the entire world?

36:13.713 --> 36:15.340
Why would I do that to my mom?

36:15.423 --> 36:21.601
You know? I mean, am I supposed
to say he deals eight balls in SI?

36:21.846 --> 36:23.063
Oh, huh.

36:25.308 --> 36:27.811
Still, you made up
occupations for your dad.

36:27.894 --> 36:28.895
No, I didn't.

36:29.479 --> 36:30.696
- No?
- No.

36:31.106 --> 36:35.156
Every... He... Yeah,
he hung drywall for a while.

36:35.276 --> 36:37.324
He was a fisherman.
He was a fisherman for a year.

36:37.404 --> 36:39.498
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah.

36:41.574 --> 36:44.498
Well, maybe that's how
you like to think of him.

36:47.789 --> 36:48.961
I have no idea.

36:51.543 --> 36:55.013
All I know is I'm fucking tired.
That's what I know.

37:05.807 --> 37:06.979
Nice rain.

37:09.102 --> 37:11.230
Clean my car off, at least that's good.

37:16.818 --> 37:18.912
- You think I'm lying, don't you?
- No.

37:22.073 --> 37:25.703
We can make things
be the way we want them to be in our head

37:27.078 --> 37:28.671
so that the pain isn't too much.

37:30.957 --> 37:32.880
And that's very different from lying.

37:34.419 --> 37:35.636
That's very different.

37:35.754 --> 37:38.553
My dad always said,
"Pain is weakness leaving the body."

37:41.134 --> 37:42.260
What do you think of that?

37:44.095 --> 37:45.847
I don't know. What do you think?

37:48.475 --> 37:52.105
It has its own warped, macho truth to it.

37:52.479 --> 37:55.779
My dad was a pretty warped, macho guy.

37:56.441 --> 37:59.411
Wouldn't even know
we were in the same family except...

38:02.155 --> 38:03.156
Except for what?

38:06.701 --> 38:10.376
People say that... I mean,
some people say that I favor him.

38:12.165 --> 38:13.917
We have the same look in our eye.

38:16.795 --> 38:17.796
What look is that?

38:18.338 --> 38:20.056
Secretiveness, I guess.

38:20.882 --> 38:25.308
Maybe something's going on,
maybe there's a time-bomb ticking.

38:28.306 --> 38:29.683
I picture my dad and

38:32.894 --> 38:34.521
all I see is a shadow.

38:38.900 --> 38:44.748
A person can reject aspects of themselves
that they don't like

38:46.282 --> 38:48.034
and put them on to somebody else.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.125
You know, project them.

38:54.082 --> 38:58.173
Things that make them uncomfortable
or things that feel dangerous,

38:58.253 --> 38:59.596
things that feel...

39:02.298 --> 39:03.299
ugly.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.267
But the funny thing is,

39:08.638 --> 39:12.233
there's a lot of positive things
in our shadow that we need.

39:12.809 --> 39:14.732
Like what?

39:19.482 --> 39:21.951
Like our instincts, for one.

39:22.277 --> 39:24.621
Like our animal instincts.

39:25.238 --> 39:26.740
So you want me to get angry?

39:30.201 --> 39:31.794
You want me to explode?

39:33.705 --> 39:36.458
No, I want you to throw
without thinking about it.

39:36.541 --> 39:39.670
I want you to be instinctual.
I want you to get out of your own way.

39:39.794 --> 39:42.297
Leave yourself alone.
Do you want to explode?

39:51.639 --> 39:52.640
No.

39:53.975 --> 39:55.727
You feel like a time-bomb sometimes?

39:57.854 --> 40:00.277
No. Of course, not.

40:01.774 --> 40:03.447
Okay. That's good. I believe that.

40:08.656 --> 40:09.908
Or I guess I was one.

40:12.535 --> 40:13.832
And I didn't even know it.

40:28.968 --> 40:29.969
Open up!

40:31.429 --> 40:32.430
Hopper.

40:33.097 --> 40:34.724
Teresa, you're looking spry.

40:35.475 --> 40:37.193
- Bitch.
- Stop it.

40:37.852 --> 40:39.479
I still haven't seen Dorothy anywhere.

40:42.982 --> 40:45.735
- Does Hop look upset to you?
- No, he doesn't look upset.

40:46.027 --> 40:48.121
I wonder if they broke up.
Shit, I hope not.

40:48.738 --> 40:52.242
Coach Eddie better not even think about
taking him out of the game.

40:53.576 --> 40:55.704
- He looks tired.
- He doesn't look tired, all right?

40:55.787 --> 40:57.334
He looks lazy like his mother.

40:57.497 --> 40:59.420
Come on, Hopper, challenge this guy.

41:00.041 --> 41:02.464
Huh, don't pussy-foot around.
Challenge him!

41:02.794 --> 41:05.138
Coach Eddie, better not make you
pussy-foot these scrubs.

41:05.630 --> 41:07.177
This kid can't hit you!

41:11.135 --> 41:12.933
There you go, there you go.

41:54.262 --> 41:56.560
Christ, big shot, huh?

41:56.848 --> 41:58.850
I guess you were really
important back then, huh?

41:59.392 --> 42:01.486
That's easy.
Come, do this right here right now.

42:03.146 --> 42:04.693
You have a good night, huh, buddy?

42:44.771 --> 42:45.772
You all right?

42:46.314 --> 42:47.315
Yeah, I'm good.

42:48.066 --> 42:49.818
- Arm's fine?
- Yeah.

42:51.944 --> 42:54.197
Just worry about that hitter
right now. That's it.

42:54.447 --> 42:55.448
Yes, Coach.

42:58.701 --> 42:59.702
Where's your mind?

43:00.870 --> 43:01.871
It's in the game.

43:02.580 --> 43:04.833
Nothing else should be
of any concern to you right now.

43:05.458 --> 43:07.131
You got to fuck all that noise.

43:08.169 --> 43:10.797
We'll deal with whatever that is
after the game.

43:11.589 --> 43:14.138
You can't worry about that stuff
'cause you can't control it.

43:15.051 --> 43:16.769
So, there's no point worrying about it.

43:17.970 --> 43:18.971
This is it.

43:19.639 --> 43:21.482
Bailing butt from this all is simple.

43:35.863 --> 43:36.864
This is it.

43:37.532 --> 43:40.001
You ever heard of F. Scott Fitzgerald?

43:41.327 --> 43:42.328
No.

43:42.870 --> 43:47.000
Well, he was a wunderkind,
like yourself. A whiz kid.

43:47.708 --> 43:51.008
So good at his craft, he didn't even
have to think about what he was doing.

43:52.046 --> 43:54.971
Now, this is about Fitzgerald, uh...

43:55.883 --> 43:57.180
- Cracking up.
- Hm.

43:57.552 --> 43:59.429
- You're cool if I read a passage?
- Sure.

44:00.179 --> 44:01.180
Short one?

44:01.848 --> 44:03.441
Okay, uh

44:04.183 --> 44:07.611
"I was him again, for an instant,

44:08.229 --> 44:10.527
I had the good fortune
to share his dreams,

44:10.648 --> 44:12.696
I, who have no more dreams of my own.

44:14.193 --> 44:17.197
And there are still times
when I creep up on him,

44:17.405 --> 44:20.124
surprise him on an autumn morning
in New York

44:20.408 --> 44:22.081
or a spring night in Carolina,

44:22.493 --> 44:25.997
when it's so quiet, you can hear a dog
barking in the next county.

44:27.957 --> 44:31.928
But never again, as during
that all too short period,

44:32.336 --> 44:34.634
when he and I were one person,

44:36.465 --> 44:38.888
when the fulfilled future
and the wistful past

44:38.968 --> 44:41.596
were mingled in a single gorgeous moment,

44:42.680 --> 44:46.935
when life was literally a dream."

44:51.147 --> 44:53.821
- He's talking about being old.
- Hm.

44:54.400 --> 44:55.777
Wishing he was young again?

44:57.153 --> 44:58.905
I don't know anything about that.

45:01.240 --> 45:03.788
Well, he wasn't that old when he wrote it.

45:03.868 --> 45:05.165
He was still a pretty young man.

45:05.536 --> 45:09.712
He felt old, he felt like he wasn't
connected to his younger self any more.

45:09.832 --> 45:10.833
That's the rub.

45:12.376 --> 45:15.216
The part where he's talking about
life being a dream,

45:15.296 --> 45:16.673
I've never experienced that.

45:16.756 --> 45:18.302
- But...
- Never.

45:18.382 --> 45:22.223
Never once, felt any kind of pleasure,
any enjoyment in your success?

45:22.303 --> 45:25.853
No, never. No. My dad always told me,
"No emotions on the mound."

45:27.225 --> 45:29.944
- So you can't show emotions on the mound.
- No.

45:30.811 --> 45:34.691
Were you allowed to show emotion
off the mound?

45:34.982 --> 45:36.445
I was never off the mound.

45:36.525 --> 45:38.364
I was taught, you are always on the mound.

45:38.444 --> 45:39.740
- Right.
- Always on the mound.

45:39.820 --> 45:41.663
You are always supposed to
outfox your opponent.

45:41.989 --> 45:43.707
- Yeah?
- Your opponent?

45:43.866 --> 45:45.459
Your opponent, yeah.

45:45.660 --> 45:47.754
- Who's the opponent off the mound?
- Everyone.

45:49.080 --> 45:51.674
Everyone outside of the family.

45:54.043 --> 45:55.044
Yeah.

45:55.586 --> 45:57.929
Must be pretty hard to talk to me then.

45:58.013 --> 46:01.345
- No, seriously.
- Well, sometimes, yeah. I guess.

46:01.425 --> 46:03.177
- Yeah. Well...
- Sure.

46:03.469 --> 46:05.892
- It's been a difficult challenge.
- Yeah.

46:07.054 --> 46:08.552
Well.

46:10.268 --> 46:15.648
Do you think your father had a lot to do
with your success as a pitcher, Hopper?

46:20.528 --> 46:23.407
Hm. I mean, yeah.

46:24.490 --> 46:27.285
When I was a little kid, I never thought
I was gonna make it to the Majors.

46:28.077 --> 46:31.172
I'd wanna go hang out with friends,
go to the beach, you know.

46:31.330 --> 46:33.708
But he, he would say,
"No, that's not gonna work.

46:33.833 --> 46:36.382
If you love it, good things will come."

46:37.962 --> 46:39.760
- So what did you do?
- I loved it.

46:39.922 --> 46:41.424
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

46:41.507 --> 46:43.975
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

46:46.679 --> 46:50.892
With three relief pitchers on the DL,
Atlanta looks to be in trouble,

46:50.975 --> 46:53.273
heading into division playoffs
this coming weekend.

46:53.602 --> 46:56.025
One name that has come up
as a possible remedy

46:56.147 --> 46:58.946
is the last wonder boy, Hopper Gibson.

46:59.608 --> 47:03.496
Gibson has spent the past few months
in the Minors trying to regain control

47:03.612 --> 47:05.159
of his considerable stuff.

47:05.781 --> 47:09.001
In the current vernacular,
the dude's got issues.

47:30.973 --> 47:32.816
It's not that hard. Come on.

47:53.204 --> 47:54.831
Uh, what do I miss most about the Majors?

47:55.748 --> 47:57.546
Probably the jet planes.

47:57.917 --> 48:00.340
Can't jump a jet plane like you can
a freight train, right, Hopper?

48:00.795 --> 48:02.138
What about those geese, Hopper?

48:03.506 --> 48:04.507
How do you mean?

48:04.590 --> 48:06.934
I mean, you watched them a long time.

48:09.929 --> 48:10.930
Yeah, I don't know.

48:11.013 --> 48:15.314
Watching the geese
was just so... peaceful.

48:16.143 --> 48:18.066
I prefer watching jet planes.

48:18.646 --> 48:21.068
Well, then, why don't you follow
someone who is in the Majors?

48:21.148 --> 48:22.900
What can I say? I'm dedicated.

48:23.025 --> 48:24.277
To car crashes, yeah.

48:24.610 --> 48:26.237
Don't talk about yourself like that.

48:26.695 --> 48:27.696
You give good quote.

48:27.780 --> 48:29.327
That shit about geese is nice stuff.

48:30.491 --> 48:31.492
I'm glad you think so.

48:31.575 --> 48:33.373
You have enough so you don't have to
tag along anymore?

48:34.453 --> 48:35.830
It's only a good quote today.

48:36.038 --> 48:37.585
Tomorrow, they'll wrap a fish in it.

48:37.957 --> 48:40.085
I'll have to come back for more, fresh.

48:41.001 --> 48:43.129
Sorry, it's exhausting for me too.

48:43.254 --> 48:45.473
Takes a lot of medicine
to keep up to this pace.

48:45.589 --> 48:47.341
I'm on the Red Bull, heavy.

48:47.466 --> 48:49.555
After this, I have to go on Twitter
and think of something

48:49.635 --> 48:54.015
charming/cutting/provocative/
sexy/informative to tweet.

48:54.140 --> 48:56.393
And then condense it into
a pithy anecdotal

48:56.475 --> 48:58.603
making sure not to go over
the heads of feeble-minded frat boys.

48:59.520 --> 49:01.773
It's a fairly fucking relentless grind.

49:02.314 --> 49:03.531
Yeah, I noticed that.

49:07.194 --> 49:10.289
Hm. I'm still on school schedule, Hop.

49:11.907 --> 49:13.750
I don't know who else to call, sorry.

49:13.868 --> 49:15.085
Wait, wait, wait.

49:15.411 --> 49:17.163
Hold on. I've got, like, no signal here.

49:17.246 --> 49:19.044
I'm gonna go out on the porch
so I can hear you better.

49:20.416 --> 49:21.588
All right, kiddo, go ahead.

49:24.128 --> 49:26.256
I don't know. Last week, you know,

49:26.338 --> 49:29.592
I seemed to be getting better.

49:29.717 --> 49:31.310
Tonight, I can't find the plate.

49:31.427 --> 49:35.227
I never know who's
gonna show up, you know.

49:35.598 --> 49:37.225
Sometimes, we're who we want to be,

49:37.308 --> 49:39.481
sometimes we're just
some dunderhead chump.

49:39.894 --> 49:42.397
That's the way it goes. That's okay.

49:42.813 --> 49:45.612
Sometimes your cutter is hitting,
sometimes it's not.

49:47.109 --> 49:49.448
But there's no need
to, like, elaborate on it,

49:49.528 --> 49:52.031
and beat the shit out of yourself
all the time the way you do.

49:52.114 --> 49:56.711
You add this extra layer of anguish by
judging yourself so harshly all the time.

49:58.162 --> 50:03.838
Yeah. I just wish I could forget about
stuff when I'm out there, you know.

50:03.918 --> 50:05.511
Forget about stuff from yesterday.

50:05.836 --> 50:09.340
Yesterday can't be junked.
You can't just get rid of it.

50:09.715 --> 50:13.515
There's no way to push it aside,
or dig a hole and bury it.

50:13.677 --> 50:15.679
- You know what I'm saying, kid?
- Yeah.

50:16.847 --> 50:18.724
How's Dorothy?

50:19.549 --> 50:22.482
I don't know.
I think she thinks I'm shallow.

50:22.603 --> 50:24.480
You got to be Paul Robeson with her.

50:25.814 --> 50:27.612
She's done with it, you know.

50:28.317 --> 50:29.569
Who's Paul Robeson?

50:31.570 --> 50:33.492
He's an all star who got blacklisted.

50:33.572 --> 50:36.075
A pariah. Where the fuck am I right now?

50:37.993 --> 50:40.837
I'm sorry for calling you,
waking you up. Go back to sleep.

50:41.622 --> 50:42.623
All right?

50:51.423 --> 50:52.800
Who should I make this out to?

50:52.883 --> 50:54.430
- Uh, Fallon.
- Fallon.

50:54.510 --> 50:57.099
How do I spell Fallon?
Does anyone have a pen? Do you have a pen?

50:57.179 --> 50:58.601
Thank you. What is it?

50:58.722 --> 51:00.724
- F-A...
- F-A...

51:01.433 --> 51:02.776
- L-L...
- L-L...

51:02.893 --> 51:04.145
- O-N.
- O-N.

51:04.228 --> 51:05.229
Cool name.

51:06.230 --> 51:07.231
There you go.

51:08.357 --> 51:09.574
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

51:10.025 --> 51:12.073
Sign the ball, please.

51:12.820 --> 51:14.572
- Yeah? Sign it?
- Yeah.

51:14.989 --> 51:16.081
- Please.
- All right.

51:22.621 --> 51:24.965
Thanks. Could you sign this card, too?

51:25.082 --> 51:26.083
Yeah.

51:26.625 --> 51:28.298
My dad says you are going to be fine.

51:29.336 --> 51:30.337
Here you go.

51:30.504 --> 51:32.882
He says you're going to
get your control back in no time at all.

51:34.800 --> 51:37.770
Um, could you show me
your curve-ball grip?

51:38.053 --> 51:39.350
Could you show me a curve-ball grip?

51:39.430 --> 51:40.647
- Let's see your grip.
- All right, cool.

51:40.764 --> 51:43.392
- So, two seams, two seams, get it.
- Yeah, there you go.

51:43.559 --> 51:44.605
- All right.
- Something like that?

51:44.685 --> 51:46.187
Yeah, all right, that's good.

51:46.645 --> 51:51.112
But see the hardest thing for me
to figure out is, you got to snap this.

51:51.275 --> 51:52.697
- Snap it like that?
- Yeah.

51:52.901 --> 51:54.949
There you go. You can't throw it
like a fast ball.

51:55.571 --> 51:57.915
Hm-mm, so right around like that?

51:58.115 --> 51:59.412
- So...
- Dude!

52:00.743 --> 52:02.461
Are you handing out instructions now?

52:03.329 --> 52:05.331
- Better go.
- That is fucking scary.

52:05.873 --> 52:06.874
Thanks, Hopper.

52:09.835 --> 52:11.553
That's the good thing
about youngsters though, right?

52:12.254 --> 52:14.222
They are undiscriminating.

52:15.841 --> 52:16.888
You know that word?

52:19.345 --> 52:21.564
Of course, you do.
I learned that word in the pen.

52:22.306 --> 52:26.857
We had this priest who used to come by
on Sunday nights, you know.

52:27.478 --> 52:28.821
Have a little Bible study.

52:29.438 --> 52:32.191
So I signed right up. For giggles.

52:33.067 --> 52:35.991
And he used to say that
Jesus was undiscriminating.

52:36.320 --> 52:38.038
He loved all of us.

52:38.280 --> 52:40.123
Each and everyone of us, just the same.

52:40.658 --> 52:41.659
You believe that?

52:42.743 --> 52:44.711
- Hm.
- So?

52:45.621 --> 52:47.339
- How's the arm?
- It's fine.

52:47.665 --> 52:48.882
- It's fine?
- Yeah.

52:49.291 --> 52:51.259
- All right.
- What are you doing here?

52:51.877 --> 52:54.505
What do you mean
what am I doing here? Come on.

52:55.589 --> 52:56.806
I came to say hi.

52:57.883 --> 52:59.601
Well, I'm not pitching today, so...

52:59.802 --> 53:01.770
I know, I know. I'm relieved.

53:02.596 --> 53:03.813
You wanna go get some peanuts?

53:04.431 --> 53:06.058
Come on, let's get some peanuts.

53:06.892 --> 53:08.769
What are you doing in California?

53:08.894 --> 53:10.316
I got a job, buddy of mine...

53:10.396 --> 53:12.319
Okeechobee, hooked me up with a...

53:13.649 --> 53:15.777
a little deal in Mexico, at the border.

53:17.152 --> 53:18.369
Job, good one.

53:18.487 --> 53:19.830
What kind of job is that?

53:20.197 --> 53:21.198
The best kind.

53:21.573 --> 53:23.291
The kind that might be my last.

53:23.867 --> 53:26.996
You know, set me up
for early retirement, like your mom.

53:30.040 --> 53:31.462
I saw the house you bought her.

53:33.877 --> 53:35.129
Lot of carpenters there.

53:36.255 --> 53:38.428
Hittin' it.

53:40.092 --> 53:43.641
Well, I guess the priest
didn't reform you, did he?

53:43.721 --> 53:44.722
No, sir.

53:45.389 --> 53:46.811
They don't make 'em like me anymore.

53:46.932 --> 53:48.275
They try to bring me down.

53:48.851 --> 53:51.070
Well, see with me,
it's a matter of self respect.

53:52.396 --> 53:55.775
- Yeah, I got to go do some running.
- No, you don't.

53:56.358 --> 53:57.735
No, you don't. Come on, now.

53:58.110 --> 54:00.112
I hear you got knocked around
a little bit the other night.

54:00.279 --> 54:01.701
- Yeah.
- You know why?

54:02.030 --> 54:03.373
- Yeah, I know why.
- Why?

54:03.615 --> 54:05.208
- My footing's off.
- Yeah.

54:05.659 --> 54:07.912
I've got professional coaches
to help me with that now.

54:08.912 --> 54:10.414
- Oh, you do?
- Yeah, I do.

54:10.497 --> 54:11.965
Okay. Okay.

54:13.041 --> 54:14.293
They helping you with your face?

54:15.878 --> 54:17.130
- My face?
- Hm-mm.

54:18.338 --> 54:19.760
Your intimidation stare.

54:21.008 --> 54:22.726
Do you remember
anything that I taught you?

54:22.968 --> 54:25.437
Huh? Bob Gibson?

54:26.513 --> 54:27.514
Dave Stewart.

54:28.015 --> 54:29.016
"The Rocket" Clemens.

54:29.892 --> 54:30.893
Ferocious?

54:31.310 --> 54:33.732
Bitchin' motherfuckers would have you out

54:33.812 --> 54:37.657
before you stepped in the batter's box
with their fucking eyes.

54:37.858 --> 54:40.072
Okay? And look at you,
you're not even a paper tiger.

54:40.152 --> 54:43.659
You wander over to the mound with your
tail between your legs like a little puppy.

54:43.739 --> 54:45.161
I was worried you were
gonna piss yourself.

54:49.036 --> 54:50.504
I'll work on my Rocket.

54:52.206 --> 54:54.755
Get some HGH and some steroids
while I'm at it.

54:54.875 --> 54:56.127
Hey, look, are you joking?

54:56.460 --> 54:57.803
Right? But...

54:58.587 --> 55:01.215
Five, ten years from now,
all that shit's gonna be legal.

55:01.340 --> 55:03.638
You know that, right?
The government can't stop evolution.

55:03.926 --> 55:05.849
All drugs should be legal.

55:05.969 --> 55:07.596
- Then you'd be out of a job.
- Hm-mm.

55:07.846 --> 55:10.520
I'd still have you as my
full time fucking employment, hm?

55:11.350 --> 55:15.400
When I delivered you,
you were a perfectly sound pitcher.

55:15.521 --> 55:20.070
Two years with these so called experts,
and what? You are all banged up.

55:20.150 --> 55:22.494
You are all... You are all tangled up.

55:24.196 --> 55:25.288
It's not their fault, Dad.

55:27.574 --> 55:28.791
So you say.

55:29.284 --> 55:32.288
They got a weight room here
in the Minors Leagues, Skinny?

55:32.371 --> 55:34.465
- All right. I got to go.
- No, no, listen.

55:34.581 --> 55:36.834
- I'm serious about the anabolics.
- Yeah. I will.

55:37.000 --> 55:40.379
- I can get you the undetectable stuff.
- All right.

56:31.305 --> 56:32.306
Get in.

56:36.059 --> 56:38.687
You got to get wet all at once,
then it's awfully pleasant.

56:40.564 --> 56:42.362
If it's so pleasant,
why aren't you getting in?

56:42.941 --> 56:43.942
Chocolate.

56:45.027 --> 56:46.779
I was on my feet all day
waiting on suckers.

56:47.529 --> 56:48.872
That makes me a sucker, too, huh?

56:50.532 --> 56:52.034
I work at Millie's a mile away.

56:54.536 --> 56:56.038
Do you see bunions on my feet?

56:56.413 --> 56:58.006
No, I don't see any bunions.

56:58.665 --> 57:00.383
Not from this distance, anyway.

57:01.460 --> 57:03.087
You with the ball club, Hopper?

57:04.087 --> 57:05.088
That's right.

57:07.090 --> 57:09.013
- What position?
- Pitcher.

57:09.760 --> 57:11.854
- Throw fast?
- Very.

57:12.429 --> 57:14.852
Oh, regular Bob Feller.

57:15.891 --> 57:17.017
That might be.

57:22.439 --> 57:23.861
My name's Candace, by the way.

57:26.360 --> 57:28.203
I'm a regular Candace.

57:28.695 --> 57:29.696
What's that mean?

57:29.821 --> 57:31.869
Get it? Regular Bob Feller,
regular Candace.

57:31.949 --> 57:32.996
Oh, I got you.

57:39.665 --> 57:41.133
So you're a waitress around here?

57:42.709 --> 57:44.461
And you live in the motel?

57:45.837 --> 57:49.967
For the night, at any rate.
My old man's a fucking child.

57:51.176 --> 57:53.895
He ran out of generosity,
even for himself.

57:54.638 --> 57:55.639
Hm.

57:56.014 --> 57:59.605
He tells me he lifted me out of the gutter,
but I'm pretty sure I'm still there.

58:02.521 --> 58:03.989
Maybe you know how it can be with drunks.

58:08.568 --> 58:10.761
Do I have something
on my mouth or something?

58:11.571 --> 58:13.748
You keep staring at my mouth.

58:17.869 --> 58:19.246
Okay, it's okay.

58:19.871 --> 58:23.466
Here. Watch it blow you a kiss.

58:35.929 --> 58:37.397
You seem ill at ease, homeboy.

58:38.223 --> 58:42.527
Yeah... If I... get caught
by the coaches I'm dead.

58:43.979 --> 58:45.447
You'll die satisfied.

58:47.566 --> 58:48.783
Hey, come here.

58:52.946 --> 58:53.947
You're a stud.

59:23.685 --> 59:24.777
Goddang.

59:25.687 --> 59:26.688
Ah.

59:27.606 --> 59:29.633
I could kiss you forever.

59:32.527 --> 59:33.699
You expecting someone?

59:35.030 --> 59:36.576
As a matter of fact, I am.

59:36.656 --> 59:37.908
Don't be too sore with me, okay?

59:39.242 --> 59:41.870
Whatever's got a tail at one end,
has teeth at the other.

59:41.953 --> 59:43.079
What the fuck are you talking about?

59:43.872 --> 59:45.715
I claimed that from The Nature Channel.

59:48.710 --> 59:50.383
Door's not locked.

59:52.214 --> 59:53.841
It's okay, it's okay.

59:54.466 --> 59:56.139
It's okay.

59:58.136 --> 01:00:01.857
I'm just gonna...
I'm just gonna take this, okay?

01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:04.859
And this.

01:00:09.147 --> 01:00:11.900
- Do whatever you want.
- Those are real nice.

01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:14.528
Oh, you need a watch, right, baby?

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:18.282
Earrings.

01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:21.535
Don't you worry.

01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:25.589
Turn over and lie on your stomach.

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:31.298
My ride's downstairs
in the form of a motorcycle.

01:00:31.378 --> 01:00:33.472
I'm going to take your party favors
and start the engine.

01:00:34.005 --> 01:00:36.178
My pal sees you move,
or hears you breathe,

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:38.802
he's gonna blast you
in the back of your head.

01:00:40.053 --> 01:00:41.680
So, don't move or breathe, Hopper.

01:00:52.023 --> 01:00:55.217
- Are you breathing?
- No.

01:00:56.695 --> 01:00:58.697
Well, you can breathe a little.

01:01:01.241 --> 01:01:04.495
Oh, man, sometimes,
I'm just plain mean and salty.

01:02:30.705 --> 01:02:31.922
Son of a bitch.

01:02:49.307 --> 01:02:51.855
I'm sorry that you're in distress

01:02:51.935 --> 01:02:55.985
but that doesn't change
the way things went down.

01:02:56.314 --> 01:02:57.361
- You know?
- Yeah.

01:02:58.942 --> 01:03:00.910
I thought I was your best friend,

01:03:01.027 --> 01:03:03.951
and, all of a sudden,
you treated me like a stalker.

01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:06.161
I felt bad for even calling you.

01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:08.039
You don't know what it's like.

01:03:08.994 --> 01:03:12.168
To be what, like, illustrious you mean?

01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:14.628
Are you still on that trip?

01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:16.210
No, I'm not.

01:03:16.334 --> 01:03:18.798
Still trying to be the dude
from the Wheaties Box?

01:03:18.878 --> 01:03:19.879
No.

01:03:21.214 --> 01:03:25.970
The sooner you realize
that we are all just utterly unique aliens

01:03:26.052 --> 01:03:27.850
in this vast universe,

01:03:29.347 --> 01:03:33.853
and stop trying to be
some commercial, conditioned,

01:03:33.935 --> 01:03:37.064
brain-washed, TV cowboy
version of yourself,

01:03:37.147 --> 01:03:38.818
- Yeah, I know. I know.
- ...the less you're gonna suffer.

01:03:38.898 --> 01:03:40.992
I know and that's not... I was...

01:03:43.445 --> 01:03:44.571
I was confused.

01:03:45.613 --> 01:03:46.614
I'm sorry.

01:03:47.365 --> 01:03:49.743
I can't. I don't know what else to say.

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:52.454
I go back to New Haven soon.

01:03:52.954 --> 01:03:54.581
I don't know what else I can do.

01:03:54.706 --> 01:03:56.379
Do you have another boyfriend
waiting for you?

01:03:59.252 --> 01:04:00.253
No.

01:04:01.087 --> 01:04:03.306
But I have papers and,

01:04:04.466 --> 01:04:06.059
teachers...

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:11.936
I can't be here for you like that anymore.

01:04:13.641 --> 01:04:16.269
You're scared and you need somebody,
maybe anybody.

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:18.855
That's not what it's like. Okay?

01:04:18.938 --> 01:04:20.940
That's not what it's like. I promise.

01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:23.493
Then what is it like? Talk to me.

01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:26.196
It's not fair.

01:04:28.198 --> 01:04:31.543
I'm not good at talking about stuff.

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:35.171
Well, when you want to talk...

01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:40.460
I'm in love with you, Hopper.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:44.263
Like a lot, you know?

01:04:45.924 --> 01:04:48.347
So, when you do want to talk,

01:04:50.136 --> 01:04:51.137
let me know.

01:05:03.108 --> 01:05:06.032
Okay. Now I want you to throw one
right over the plate, strike.

01:05:06.236 --> 01:05:07.362
Okay? Show me what you've got.

01:05:08.113 --> 01:05:09.865
What do you want? Cheese, Charlie?

01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:11.912
- Change up?
- Whatever you want.

01:05:12.283 --> 01:05:14.606
- Anything?
- Just throw me a strike.

01:05:14.694 --> 01:05:15.695
All right?

01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:27.590
All right.

01:05:28.675 --> 01:05:30.723
What's the most fun
you ever had playing baseball?

01:05:31.678 --> 01:05:32.725
- Fun?
- Hm-mm.

01:05:33.555 --> 01:05:35.398
Now, come on, there must have been
one time. Come on.

01:05:37.183 --> 01:05:38.897
Yeah, I guess there was one time.

01:05:38.977 --> 01:05:41.191
When I was five or six, we used to play
in this abandoned parking lot.

01:05:41.271 --> 01:05:42.317
That was fun.

01:05:42.397 --> 01:05:44.650
- Did you pitch?
- Yeah, that's the first time I pitched.

01:05:45.483 --> 01:05:47.030
- And that was fun?
- Yeah.

01:05:47.694 --> 01:05:49.196
What was so fun about pitching then?

01:05:49.696 --> 01:05:51.242
I don't know. We were just stupid kids.

01:05:51.322 --> 01:05:53.165
Nobody expected anything of us, you know.

01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:58.038
How do you think you can
get pitching to feel that way again?

01:05:58.997 --> 01:06:01.341
I don't know. That's the big question.

01:06:02.584 --> 01:06:05.929
You add millions of dollars to it
and something changes, I guess.

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:08.798
Probably have to do hypnosis
to make me think

01:06:08.882 --> 01:06:11.355
I'm in an abandoned
parking lot or something.

01:06:13.802 --> 01:06:15.815
Close your eyes.

01:06:16.222 --> 01:06:18.645
- I wasn't serious.
- I am. Now close your eyes.

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:22.859
- Huh.
- No laughing, come on, man.

01:06:24.522 --> 01:06:29.073
See it, hear it, feel it, smell it.

01:06:30.528 --> 01:06:32.345
- Smell it?
- Yeah.

01:06:34.115 --> 01:06:35.788
Yeah, you are five years old.

01:06:36.284 --> 01:06:37.285
Uh...

01:06:38.745 --> 01:06:42.332
could be a warm day like this one,
if that's what you remember.

01:06:46.252 --> 01:06:47.469
- Seriously?
- Can you see anything?

01:06:47.879 --> 01:06:49.096
Can you see anything?

01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:55.846
Yeah, I can see it, kinda.

01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:58.227
And what do you see?

01:07:02.894 --> 01:07:03.895
I don't know.

01:07:07.148 --> 01:07:08.149
I, uh...

01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:13.288
You are, what, five years old.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.577
Deep, deep breath.

01:07:22.830 --> 01:07:24.798
That's it. Take another deep breath.

01:07:28.836 --> 01:07:30.463
Wind up and throw whenever you want.

01:07:31.756 --> 01:07:32.757
Go for it.

01:07:50.233 --> 01:07:52.076
How'd that feel?

01:07:53.361 --> 01:07:54.362
Felt good.

01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:56.622
How did it look?

01:07:58.658 --> 01:07:59.659
Perfect.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.193
- There he is!
- Hopper! Hopper!

01:08:25.475 --> 01:08:27.194
Any comment on your dad's arrest?

01:08:27.562 --> 01:08:29.734
How do you feel about
his criminal record being exposed?

01:08:29.814 --> 01:08:31.528
Come on, Hopper. It's me, talk to me.

01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:35.782
Ladies and gentlemen,
my client has no comment at this time.

01:08:35.862 --> 01:08:37.613
Give me an exclusive.
I'll put sugar on it.

01:08:38.488 --> 01:08:40.207
Oh, you filthy little girl.

01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:43.790
We can't get the public to be sympathetic
to Hopper if they don't know him.

01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:47.750
Hey, where are JD Salinger
and Boo Radley staying? Go there.

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:51.627
Cunt.

01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:53.758
Go. Go.

01:08:53.837 --> 01:08:56.511
You got to tell me when the club
puts you in a shitty dump like this.

01:08:56.633 --> 01:08:58.727
They didn't put me in here,
I asked to be put in here.

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:01.470
Huh.

01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:06.818
What's with the get-up?

01:09:07.393 --> 01:09:11.899
Ah, fundraising benefit.
I figured I'd go as the Duke of Earl.

01:09:13.191 --> 01:09:14.192
Hm.

01:09:18.196 --> 01:09:19.533
You look like hell, Hopper.

01:09:19.613 --> 01:09:22.082
You should have Mobley
prescribe you some sleeping pills.

01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:26.291
Well, Mobley doesn't like pills.

01:09:27.037 --> 01:09:28.756
- He doesn't like pills, huh?
- No.

01:09:28.872 --> 01:09:30.625
- You still like him, though?
- He's all right.

01:09:34.212 --> 01:09:37.011
- Those fucking parasites.
- What did they get my dad on?

01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:39.850
Drug smuggling.

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:43.897
- It's pretty serious.
- So did we lose any endorsements?

01:09:45.055 --> 01:09:46.933
No, you did not.

01:09:48.267 --> 01:09:51.107
Under Armour has contacted me.
They want to talk. But it's cool.

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:53.939
You did not get into trouble,
your father did.

01:09:55.858 --> 01:09:58.452
Could you not worry
about the companies? That's my job.

01:09:59.404 --> 01:10:00.405
Yeah.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.662
Okay. Sick.

01:10:07.829 --> 01:10:08.830
Let's dry you off.

01:10:09.539 --> 01:10:12.167
Okay? Let's not catch a cold
on top of everything else.

01:10:14.627 --> 01:10:16.629
I'm gonna stay with you
till things settle down.

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:18.597
It's all right. You don't need to do that.

01:10:18.715 --> 01:10:20.012
- With all your other clients...
- Nonsense.

01:10:25.513 --> 01:10:27.686
You wanted to stay here, huh?

01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:30.814
We're stuck.
We've got the leeches outside.

01:10:31.894 --> 01:10:35.194
All right. I'm gonna order us dinner
from the Four Seasons, okay?

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:43.281
Pass me the salt, please.

01:10:45.116 --> 01:10:46.368
Thank you. So...

01:10:46.951 --> 01:10:52.461
now that I've shown up, it's gonna deflect
a lot of negativity away from you.

01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:55.548
The press hates me more than anyone.

01:10:57.003 --> 01:11:00.514
When we have the families come in, when
we are representing the premium people,

01:11:00.631 --> 01:11:04.305
the draft, you know, the parents,
fathers and mothers and players,

01:11:04.385 --> 01:11:07.138
and they look at me
and they thank me for what I do,

01:11:09.348 --> 01:11:11.100
I don't give a shit what the press says.

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.813
I mean, we got to have
a thick skin in this game.

01:11:15.188 --> 01:11:16.656
All of us do.

01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:18.275
- Right?
- Right.

01:11:23.988 --> 01:11:25.365
Big league team is calling you up.

01:11:27.575 --> 01:11:29.077
Go to LA, couple of days.

01:11:32.371 --> 01:11:33.998
My dad's in prison in LA.

01:11:34.582 --> 01:11:36.334
I thought of that.
You don't have to think about that.

01:11:38.669 --> 01:11:40.512
You gotta try that with butter.
I won't tell.

01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:47.349
So, where did they find Dr. Mobley?

01:11:48.721 --> 01:11:50.223
Everyone in sports knows him.

01:11:52.016 --> 01:11:55.357
- He's got a good reputation?
- What do you think? Yeah.

01:11:56.395 --> 01:11:59.566
The guy was on the cover of Time Magazine
when he was, like, 22 years old.

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:00.650
He's brilliant.

01:12:01.859 --> 01:12:03.406
What was he on the cover
of Time Magazine for?

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:08.582
He was the first mental skills coach hired
full time by a big league club at, like, 21.

01:12:08.825 --> 01:12:11.999
He was a prodigy. He was like
the Bobby Fischer of Sports Psychology.

01:12:13.663 --> 01:12:14.915
Who's Bobby Fischer?

01:12:15.790 --> 01:12:17.754
No one. No one you need to think about.

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:18.835
That's a shitty example.

01:12:19.085 --> 01:12:23.010
You ever been to any kind of
mental coach or psychologist before? No?

01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:25.177
- No.
- So...

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:30.934
When I got some money, the first thing
I did was I got a shrink. Right?

01:12:31.597 --> 01:12:34.066
And I went every other day for five years,

01:12:34.934 --> 01:12:37.312
And finally, the guy says to me, "Oh...

01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:39.901
you want to kill your father
and fuck your mother."

01:12:41.232 --> 01:12:43.735
I said, "Oh, thanks, Tyreseus,
that's why people go to shrinks.

01:12:43.818 --> 01:12:46.241
Can I have my
quarter of a million dollars back now?"

01:12:46.487 --> 01:12:48.188
You know?

01:12:48.531 --> 01:12:51.375
But, look, Mobley, he's the man.

01:12:52.326 --> 01:12:55.041
He worked with Howard Glass
before people even understood

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:56.922
that there's such a thing
as Sports Psychology.

01:12:57.123 --> 01:12:58.841
He said he didn't work with Howard Glass.

01:13:00.877 --> 01:13:02.003
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:13:04.547 --> 01:13:07.342
I mean, you know these fucking shrinks,
they say one thing to their patients,

01:13:07.425 --> 01:13:10.766
another thing to their non-patients,
and another thing altogether to their wives.

01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:13.272
They work in strange and mysterious ways.

01:13:15.349 --> 01:13:16.521
I mean, you and me are friends.

01:13:16.601 --> 01:13:18.854
We straight talk to each other,
but shrinks have...

01:13:19.937 --> 01:13:21.314
weird ways. That's how they are.

01:13:22.064 --> 01:13:24.863
Yeah. You sure
he worked with Howard Glass?

01:13:24.984 --> 01:13:26.281
- Yes.
- Yeah?

01:13:26.986 --> 01:13:29.409
When Glass died,
Mobley dedicated his practice

01:13:29.530 --> 01:13:31.532
solely to athletes who are suffering from

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:34.410
you know, from the yips.

01:13:35.328 --> 01:13:37.706
Well, he's the expert in the field now.
Perhaps, you misheard him.

01:13:37.788 --> 01:13:38.960
No, I didn't mishear him.

01:13:40.374 --> 01:13:44.045
Hop, I'm telling you, Mobley is the man.

01:13:45.296 --> 01:13:46.923
I trust him. Do you trust me?

01:13:48.007 --> 01:13:50.476
- Yeah.
- Then we are all good.

01:13:51.844 --> 01:13:53.061
Eat your fancy dinner.

01:13:57.516 --> 01:14:00.815
When I threw with my eyes closed,
I wasn't throwing strikes.

01:14:02.188 --> 01:14:03.940
Right? You were just fucking with me?

01:14:05.566 --> 01:14:07.239
No, I'm not just fucking with you.

01:14:08.027 --> 01:14:09.370
Those were strikes, man.

01:14:13.574 --> 01:14:14.700
Well,

01:14:16.535 --> 01:14:19.414
I guess I really won't know for sure
until it's too late.

01:14:19.997 --> 01:14:23.467
Out there, humiliating myself
in front of the entire universe again.

01:14:23.751 --> 01:14:25.003
Okay. Well.

01:14:27.088 --> 01:14:30.183
- What's up, man?
- You didn't tell me anything

01:14:30.883 --> 01:14:32.430
about Howard Glass.

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:35.350
When I brought him up,
you just glazed right over it.

01:14:36.597 --> 01:14:39.146
Don't you think I would wanna
know about that?

01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:42.229
I didn't want you to dwell on him.

01:14:43.562 --> 01:14:45.485
In that moment, uh...

01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:51.532
In that moment, I wanted to keep
the focus of the sessions squarely on you.

01:14:51.612 --> 01:14:53.080
So, we don't keep the focus on you?

01:14:53.197 --> 01:14:54.869
- No.
- We stay away from the focus on you.

01:14:54.949 --> 01:14:56.201
Right?

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:02.715
Howard Glass was my patient, yes.
It's true.

01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:08.797
And his suicide affected me greatly.

01:15:09.964 --> 01:15:11.432
Altered the course of my life.

01:15:11.799 --> 01:15:13.426
It altered the course of my practice.

01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:16.558
You're a great talker.

01:15:18.431 --> 01:15:20.399
But you couldn't talk him out...

01:15:21.142 --> 01:15:22.189
of killing himself.

01:15:22.643 --> 01:15:24.065
No, I couldn't, no.

01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:25.988
Does that haunt you?

01:15:28.566 --> 01:15:31.911
There was a time
when I put the blame on myself, yeah.

01:15:34.155 --> 01:15:35.532
But I was...

01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:38.534
young.

01:15:39.785 --> 01:15:41.537
And I've learned things since then.

01:15:41.912 --> 01:15:44.916
Um, I know now what I can and can't do.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:50.130
I can only talk to you
and listen to you and be here with you.

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:51.839
I can't go out the door with you.

01:15:52.798 --> 01:15:54.300
Or take the mound for you.

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:56.678
Or pitch for you. Only you can do that.

01:15:58.429 --> 01:16:00.523
- So?
- Are you married?

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:04.614
I'm divorced.
Is there anything else you want to know?

01:16:04.694 --> 01:16:06.271
- She left you?
- Yeah.

01:16:06.604 --> 01:16:07.821
- Why did she leave you?
- That's right.

01:16:08.022 --> 01:16:09.319
- What?
- Why did she leave you?

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:14.241
Um, I was never home.
I was always working.

01:16:14.445 --> 01:16:15.913
And even when I was at home.

01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:19.409
Um, see, there's now a little, kinda...

01:16:22.203 --> 01:16:23.750
It's not exactly the truth, is it?

01:16:24.497 --> 01:16:27.341
I mean, I did a lot of Googling on you.

01:16:27.458 --> 01:16:29.631
I read the web. It's out there.

01:16:31.253 --> 01:16:33.176
- I got the scoop on you, doc.
- Yeah.

01:16:35.007 --> 01:16:36.879
All right, let's hear it then.

01:16:38.257 --> 01:16:42.852
Your life, I mean, you sound
like you have it all together,

01:16:42.932 --> 01:16:45.310
but your life is
pretty fucking far from perfect.

01:16:45.893 --> 01:16:49.193
I think both of us have some issues
about being perfect, man.

01:16:49.355 --> 01:16:51.357
After he died, you hit the bottle
pretty hard, right?

01:16:56.612 --> 01:16:57.613
Yeah.

01:16:59.406 --> 01:17:01.454
Arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct.

01:17:01.534 --> 01:17:03.081
- Yeah.
- Holy fuckin' shit.

01:17:03.869 --> 01:17:07.419
Doc, I mean, she probably
thought she was marrying a superstar,

01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:10.384
and you didn't
live up to those expectations.

01:17:10.793 --> 01:17:12.136
Sounds familiar.

01:17:12.670 --> 01:17:15.219
Yeah. Kinda fell short.

01:17:16.382 --> 01:17:18.225
Bye-bye, magazine covers.

01:17:20.094 --> 01:17:21.095
Yup.

01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:24.770
That was the best part, actually.

01:17:26.267 --> 01:17:28.565
And I wasn't all that comfortable
with the attention myself.

01:17:30.146 --> 01:17:33.569
Well, try living under
a fucking microscope today.

01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:34.741
- Yeah.
- You know?

01:17:35.359 --> 01:17:37.111
They will eat you alive.

01:17:37.528 --> 01:17:39.371
They find the smallest chink
in your armor.

01:17:41.890 --> 01:17:43.288
Take off the armor.

01:17:43.617 --> 01:17:44.630
- Take off the armor?
- Yes.

01:17:44.710 --> 01:17:47.629
That's easy for you to say, because
nobody gives a shit about you anymore.

01:17:48.873 --> 01:17:53.344
A lot of people want an arm
that throws a 100 mile an hour fast ball.

01:17:54.712 --> 01:17:57.386
You know what? They can have the arm.

01:17:59.216 --> 01:18:01.180
They really can. You want the arm?

01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:02.637
You can have it. It's yours.

01:18:03.429 --> 01:18:05.807
- No, thank you.
- Oh, come on. You know you want it.

01:18:07.057 --> 01:18:10.022
Who doesn't want an arm
that can throw a fast ball?

01:18:10.102 --> 01:18:11.103
Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure.

01:18:11.854 --> 01:18:13.276
Are you sure you don't want it?

01:18:13.397 --> 01:18:15.399
- Oh, I'm sure I don't want it.
- Okay.

01:18:15.482 --> 01:18:17.735
- I promise you that.
- Then what do you want?

01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:19.236
- What do I want?
- Yes.

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:21.448
- Fuck you, we're not going there.
- No. Fuck you.

01:18:22.072 --> 01:18:23.369
Fuck you, come on.

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:25.955
- Oh, fuck you, fuck you.
- Okay.

01:18:27.453 --> 01:18:29.330
That feeling you had when you were a kid,

01:18:30.831 --> 01:18:32.674
playing in the parking lot
with your friends,

01:18:35.794 --> 01:18:37.467
that's still available to you.

01:18:37.630 --> 01:18:40.053
That's still available to you,
that still exists.

01:18:40.174 --> 01:18:41.801
I swear to God, it does.

01:18:44.136 --> 01:18:46.264
Now you may feel
kinda beat up and fucked up,

01:18:46.388 --> 01:18:48.937
and you're siting in the corner
of some washed-up asshole's office.

01:18:49.099 --> 01:18:53.150
But I swear to you,
that feeling of being and playing,

01:18:53.979 --> 01:18:55.731
that still is available to you.

01:18:56.106 --> 01:18:57.278
You threw strikes.

01:18:58.609 --> 01:19:00.282
I couldn't bullshit you about that.

01:19:01.403 --> 01:19:02.404
You know it.

01:19:04.365 --> 01:19:05.366
So, believe me.

01:19:08.285 --> 01:19:10.663
And this overwhelming suspicion
you have of people,

01:19:10.746 --> 01:19:13.215
is old, old, old fear,

01:19:13.332 --> 01:19:15.755
and you can let go of that now.
Let go of it now.

01:19:20.673 --> 01:19:22.175
I compete out of fear.

01:19:24.051 --> 01:19:26.053
How am I gonna compete
if I don't have fear?

01:19:26.136 --> 01:19:27.308
You wanna compete?

01:19:27.805 --> 01:19:29.102
You just said you wanted...

01:19:29.223 --> 01:19:31.271
I doesn't matter what I want,
'cause I have a contract.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.147
And you know what?
I'll tell you something.

01:19:33.269 --> 01:19:34.896
They picked the wrong fucking guy.

01:19:36.522 --> 01:19:38.365
Because I'm just an ordinary kid.

01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:43.867
I'm just an ordinary kid.

01:19:45.864 --> 01:19:47.866
And maybe that's what
makes you the right kid.

01:19:47.992 --> 01:19:49.619
- Can I lie down for a second?
- Yeah.

01:20:43.213 --> 01:20:45.056
So, you ready for the big game, hm?

01:20:46.216 --> 01:20:48.059
Got you coming out to the pen, huh?

01:20:50.512 --> 01:20:51.980
You're going to save everybody?

01:20:52.806 --> 01:20:55.309
I raised you to be a horse,
not to come out to the pen.

01:20:56.769 --> 01:20:59.521
So, hero, what you doing here?

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:05.911
Well, my mental coach
thought it would be a good idea.

01:21:06.487 --> 01:21:08.239
- Your what?
- My mental coach.

01:21:12.409 --> 01:21:13.535
Whatever.

01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:16.664
- What do you talk about with him?
- I don't know. Whatever.

01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:19.542
Whatever we want to, I guess.

01:21:19.666 --> 01:21:20.667
Really?

01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:24.631
What's the... what's the diagnosis?

01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:26.181
Ah, it's complicated.

01:21:26.298 --> 01:21:28.346
- Oh, I bet.
- Actually, it's pretty simple.

01:21:28.467 --> 01:21:32.313
But, I'd rather not get into it.

01:21:33.013 --> 01:21:34.105
Suit yourself.

01:21:35.307 --> 01:21:37.480
We got a shit load of shrinks around here.

01:21:37.684 --> 01:21:38.856
I just never...

01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:43.361
feel like telling my private life
to some total stranger.

01:21:43.732 --> 01:21:46.155
You know Frank Bullet
never cried to a quack, right?

01:21:47.778 --> 01:21:50.281
- You know who that is?
- Frank Bullet?

01:21:51.615 --> 01:21:52.616
Yeah.

01:21:53.534 --> 01:21:55.622
- He's from the...
- From the movie, "Bullet."

01:21:55.702 --> 01:21:56.703
- Bullet?
- Yeah.

01:21:56.787 --> 01:21:59.916
Anyway, he's a cop, right? But he's not
some loud ol' pig like these fuckers.

01:22:00.274 --> 01:22:02.658
- Yeah.
- They are trying to reform me.

01:22:03.293 --> 01:22:04.670
Yeah, turn me into a...

01:22:05.796 --> 01:22:06.843
modern man.

01:22:09.049 --> 01:22:12.679
Modern man, to me,
looks an awful lot like a modern sissy.

01:22:12.928 --> 01:22:15.101
So do you have any friends
in here this time?

01:22:16.265 --> 01:22:17.482
All my friends are dead.

01:22:21.145 --> 01:22:24.445
I had a dream about your mom last night.

01:22:26.024 --> 01:22:27.867
She was the same age as when we met.

01:22:28.026 --> 01:22:30.245
You know, head cheerleader.
That's all she cared about.

01:22:30.654 --> 01:22:33.533
You know, but she was...
she was super pretty.

01:22:33.991 --> 01:22:36.790
She'd do those tumbles
into jumps, you know.

01:22:36.910 --> 01:22:37.957
Stellar shit.

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:40.964
She led her whole team
to this competition in, uh,

01:22:41.748 --> 01:22:44.126
Tokyo, Japan. Did you know that?

01:22:44.251 --> 01:22:46.299
- Your mom competed in Japan.
- No.

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:47.759
- You didn't know that?
- No, I didn't.

01:22:47.921 --> 01:22:50.219
I mean, I knew she was a cheerleader,
but I didn't know...

01:22:50.299 --> 01:22:51.471
- She was the captain, dude.
- Yeah.

01:22:51.717 --> 01:22:54.220
- Yeah, Regional Four champion.
- Yeah.

01:22:54.344 --> 01:22:56.142
- Yeah, she didn't tell you that?
- No.

01:22:57.764 --> 01:23:01.394
Well, she was never
the bragging type, you know.

01:23:02.561 --> 01:23:04.438
I'll give her that.

01:23:06.690 --> 01:23:08.988
High-school sweethearts die hard.

01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:10.782
Champ, beware.

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:12.745
Well, you know what?

01:23:13.405 --> 01:23:15.453
- I started talking to Dorothy last night.
- Yeah.

01:23:16.408 --> 01:23:18.627
- Yeah, we talked for five hours.
- Five hours?

01:23:18.744 --> 01:23:20.371
- Five hours.
- You're Chatty Cathy, huh?

01:23:20.454 --> 01:23:22.081
- I guess so.
- You think you love her?

01:23:22.331 --> 01:23:23.753
- I think so.
- Hm.

01:23:24.124 --> 01:23:26.297
You know how to do that, huh?
Love somebody.

01:23:26.627 --> 01:23:30.427
I need someone.
I think, she doesn't like, she...

01:23:31.632 --> 01:23:33.976
- I have to communicate.
- Yeah, right.

01:23:34.092 --> 01:23:35.344
- Or she gets pissed.
- Yeah.

01:23:35.427 --> 01:23:36.428
Yeah.

01:23:38.347 --> 01:23:42.272
So you don't even care, huh?
You just, you let her wear the pants?

01:23:42.434 --> 01:23:45.313
Yeah, sometimes. I guess.

01:23:49.399 --> 01:23:51.527
What are you doing here, horse, hm?

01:23:54.404 --> 01:23:55.405
I mean,

01:23:58.575 --> 01:24:00.372
I taught you everything I know already.

01:24:00.452 --> 01:24:01.829
You got my two cents.

01:24:04.623 --> 01:24:05.624
But you knew that.

01:24:07.376 --> 01:24:08.593
But here you are.

01:24:10.337 --> 01:24:11.964
You just come to see the old man, huh?

01:24:12.130 --> 01:24:13.723
Your old man who's not worth a damn.

01:24:16.927 --> 01:24:20.727
I mean, the fact that you
would come here to see me,

01:24:21.932 --> 01:24:22.933
before your big...

01:24:24.935 --> 01:24:26.027
It's a big game, you know.

01:24:26.895 --> 01:24:27.896
It is.

01:24:30.399 --> 01:24:32.321
I mean...
