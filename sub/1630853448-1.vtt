WEBVTT

00:12.220 --> 00:15.264
(drum roll tapping)

00:15.265 --> 00:18.518
- Greetings children,
Captain Disillusion here!

00:18.519 --> 00:20.227
For now.

00:20.228 --> 00:22.772
Society has long been
obsessed with the apocalypse,

00:22.773 --> 00:24.691
and the collapse of civilization

00:24.692 --> 00:26.734
So, how close is it?

00:26.735 --> 00:30.071
Well, from lizard people
to the illuminati.

00:30.072 --> 00:32.531
And UFOs to ghosts.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.826
We've laid many of these
conspiracy theories

00:34.827 --> 00:37.787
about the end of days, where
they belong.

00:37.788 --> 00:40.081
On the biggest trash fire in
history.

00:40.082 --> 00:42.166
Only problem is, there's a new
fear

00:42.167 --> 00:44.293
that's taking hold of the
internet.

00:44.294 --> 00:46.754
A horror story as old as time.

00:46.755 --> 00:49.632
Well, as old as George Romero.

00:49.633 --> 00:51.593
That's right, zombies.

00:51.594 --> 00:52.760
Those decaying ghouls,

00:52.761 --> 00:55.429
that have been devouring
our screens for decades,

00:55.430 --> 00:57.139
and just won't seem to die,

00:57.140 --> 01:00.602
no matter how hard Rick Grimes
and The Walking Dead tries,

01:00.603 --> 01:04.271
have apparently been clawing
their way into the real world.

01:04.272 --> 01:05.982
As you know, most of my debunks

01:05.983 --> 01:08.484
centre around one
video or channel

01:08.485 --> 01:12.196
that's attempting to pull the
wool over your beautiful eyes.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.740
But in the last few weeks,

01:13.741 --> 01:15.825
there's been an unprecedented
outbreak

01:15.826 --> 01:18.745
of supposed zombie
attacks, caught on video.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.872
These have come from all over
the world,

01:20.873 --> 01:25.001
from people who couldn't
possibly be connected, right?

01:25.002 --> 01:27.294
Now before anyone blames Russia,

01:27.295 --> 01:29.296
I'm going to take each video,

01:29.297 --> 01:32.133
and try to find a rational
explanation.

01:32.134 --> 01:33.676
Because I know one thing.

01:33.677 --> 01:35.928
Zombies aren't real.

01:35.929 --> 01:39.849
Just like Father Christmas,
and the NRA's integrity.

01:39.850 --> 01:43.686
Sometimes, you need to take
a step back to see the truth.

01:43.687 --> 01:46.898
These videos, bar the
terrible student shorts

01:46.899 --> 01:50.484
and low budget web series,
all share one thing in common.

01:50.485 --> 01:52.403
Anatomical accuracy.

01:52.404 --> 01:54.488
Here, you can see this poor
fellow's guts,

01:54.489 --> 01:56.658
ripped out before his very eyes.

01:56.659 --> 01:58.242
But how could this be so?

01:58.243 --> 02:01.746
Well, with the help of
our old friend, CGI.

02:01.747 --> 02:02.748
All these examples,

02:03.916 --> 02:05.958
display a distressing a
amount of medical accuracy.

02:05.959 --> 02:09.086
But the usual telltale
imperfections are not present.

02:09.086 --> 02:11.255
So, what could this mean?

02:11.256 --> 02:14.091
I'm pretty sure it's good old
Hollywood

02:14.092 --> 02:16.427
achieving high-end
visual effects realism,

02:16.428 --> 02:18.721
with cold hard cash.

02:18.722 --> 02:22.099
What we have here is nothing
more than a viral campaign,

02:22.100 --> 02:24.310
for a new TV series, or
video game.

02:24.311 --> 02:26.270
About a zombie doctor,

02:26.271 --> 02:30.817
and their wacky, anatomically
correct hi-jinks.

02:30.818 --> 02:33.320
Because, what else could it be?

02:34.404 --> 02:37.990
It's not like zombies
could actually be real.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.326
I mean who cares if for
the first time ever,

02:40.327 --> 02:43.830
I couldn't find any evidence of
fakery.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.873
Haven't I done enough, YouTube?

02:45.874 --> 02:50.920
Haven't I debunked enough,
to get this one on faith?

02:50.921 --> 02:53.214
Anyway, that's all the
time we have for this week!

02:53.215 --> 02:55.675
Remember, love with your heart!

02:55.676 --> 02:58.720
Use your head, for everything
else!

02:58.721 --> 03:01.431
(zombie roaring)

03:04.392 --> 03:07.311
(fire crackling)

03:07.312 --> 03:11.149
(dramatic orchestral music)

03:15.571 --> 03:17.238
- So, this is it.

03:17.239 --> 03:19.616
This is the end.

03:19.617 --> 03:23.953
Thank you, for being there
with me through this.

03:23.954 --> 03:26.122
It's been a real journey.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.666
But, all things must come to
an end.

03:28.667 --> 03:32.336
And so must graphic novel week.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.755
Can I just say,

03:33.756 --> 03:36.216
I have had such a great week.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.136
Words with pictures, who knew?

03:40.137 --> 03:42.263
They just go so well together!

03:42.264 --> 03:43.848
You know I took a real risk this
week,

03:43.849 --> 03:44.807
going with graphic novels.

03:44.808 --> 03:47.226
But, it's paid off.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.561
I've learned so much.

03:48.562 --> 03:51.564
Words and pictures, pictures and
words.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.065
Great combination.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.234
Welcome back to
"Books in the Tent",

03:55.235 --> 03:57.403
with me your host, Hannah.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.656
Much better I think than
"Books in the Bath",

03:59.657 --> 04:01.991
because people keep trying to
get in and shower in with you.

04:01.992 --> 04:04.536
And all the pages get soggy.

04:04.537 --> 04:08.247
And you see things you don't
wanna see, so much better here.

04:08.248 --> 04:11.250
Back to regular old words, next

04:11.251 --> 04:12.960
But I'm looking forward to it.

04:12.961 --> 04:15.171
Be a nice change of pace.

04:15.172 --> 04:18.173
You know, this blog has been a
real...

04:18.175 --> 04:19.841
A real help for me in the
apocalypse,

04:19.843 --> 04:22.929
because as you know viewer,
it's been a right slog.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.471
Getting a bit boring, these days

04:24.472 --> 04:27.810
And to be honest, I've had
enough of that.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.772
A bit stuffy in here,
let's go out.

04:32.898 --> 04:34.566
Okay.

04:34.567 --> 04:39.028
So yeah, I sort of thought
I'd reimagine my old blog.

04:39.029 --> 04:40.572
Now that we're living in the
library.

04:40.573 --> 04:43.157
Do you wanna have a look?

04:43.158 --> 04:45.702
Pretty good, I think you'll see.

04:45.703 --> 04:47.078
There we are.

04:47.079 --> 04:49.205
We made it quite homely, really.

04:49.206 --> 04:50.457
Quite pleased with it, anyway.

04:51.584 --> 04:52.249
So, it's nice to be
surrounded by all these books.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.585
If only I could read...

04:53.586 --> 04:55.127
(laughs) That's just a joke.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.797
Of course I can read.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.466
- Tony has blocked up the toilet

05:00.467 --> 05:01.258
I mean, I think it was Tony.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.468
It was either a zombie, or Tony.

05:02.469 --> 05:03.636
Or, part of a zombie!

05:03.637 --> 05:04.762
Or, a zombie's pooed in it.

05:04.763 --> 05:05.638
But, I can't get it out.

05:05.639 --> 05:06.765
There's this gunk-
- Yeah, Miles.

05:07.725 --> 05:08.600
Can you-
- And you can't get the-

05:08.601 --> 05:09.266
- Miles, Miles.
- Bat under the-

05:09.267 --> 05:09.809
- Please put some clothes on.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.811
- Really, really...

05:11.812 --> 05:13.229
Really worrying.

05:13.230 --> 05:14.981
- Right, okay.

05:14.982 --> 05:15.816
Back to my blog.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.484
- Yes, and your millions of
viewers.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.361
- I've got four subscribers,
actually.

05:20.362 --> 05:22.196
- Yeah, it's all Tony though.

05:22.197 --> 05:24.741
- Yeah well, at least he's
trying to be supportive.

05:24.742 --> 05:26.659
- Supportive.
- Yeah.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.745
- I think Tony's reached
that stage of the apocalypse,

05:28.746 --> 05:29.871
do you know what I mean?

05:29.872 --> 05:31.205
- No, not really.

05:31.206 --> 05:31.914
- Well...

05:31.915 --> 05:33.583
(CRASH OUTSIDE)

05:33.584 --> 05:34.333
- I think-
- I mean.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.042
- I think we should-
- Yes.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.836
- Check on him actually, yeah.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.671
- All right, I'm gonna bring
this.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.340
Oh, you've forgotten your bat!

05:41.341 --> 05:42.342
Just, oh no!

05:44.344 --> 05:45.178
Tony?

05:46.096 --> 05:47.014
Tony?

05:49.349 --> 05:50.350
- Tony?

05:51.351 --> 05:51.893
I'll get his attention like
last time.

05:51.894 --> 05:52.561
- [Hannah] Uh, Miles.

05:53.521 --> 05:54.604
- No up, I'm gonna fire up.
- No, Miles.

05:54.605 --> 05:55.312
- I'm gonna shoot the ceiling.
- Miles, please!

05:55.313 --> 05:55.855
- Hey, hey, Hannah, Miles.

05:55.856 --> 05:56.272
Check this out!

05:56.273 --> 05:56.731
Fus-ro-dah!

05:56.732 --> 06:00.027
(Tony laughing)

06:01.820 --> 06:04.238
You see that?
- Yes, no.

06:04.239 --> 06:06.073
- Dude's dead, so he doesn't
know to dodge the ball!

06:06.074 --> 06:06.949
- Very clever, Tony.

06:06.950 --> 06:07.659
Yes, very clever.

06:07.660 --> 06:08.911
- Hey, what's eating you two?

06:10.037 --> 06:10.703
You both look like someone's
shit in your cereal.

06:10.704 --> 06:11.788
Which was not me, this time.

06:11.789 --> 06:13.414
- Things are just getting
a little bit like,

06:13.415 --> 06:15.042
samey, you know?

06:16.502 --> 06:17.209
- Well, I mean...

06:17.210 --> 06:18.795
It has been like 10 years.

06:18.796 --> 06:20.880
- It's been 10 years?
- 10 years!

06:20.881 --> 06:21.839
- [Hannah] Are you sure?

06:21.840 --> 06:23.090
- Bloody hell.

06:23.091 --> 06:25.635
It has.
- Yeah, 10 next week.

06:25.636 --> 06:28.304
- [Hannah] Man I thought it
had been like, six months.

06:28.305 --> 06:30.222
Wait, how old does that make me?

06:30.223 --> 06:31.933
- Five?

06:31.934 --> 06:32.642
- I mean, time flies

06:32.643 --> 06:34.185
when you're just sort of smooshi

06:34.186 --> 06:35.645
and not really caring.

06:35.646 --> 06:37.814
- Well, that's why we should
be doing fun things like this!

06:37.815 --> 06:39.899
Or maybe we should, you
know, go out some time?

06:39.900 --> 06:41.233
We should go shopping,
it's been a while.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.443
We should hit the road.
- All right.

06:42.444 --> 06:43.695
- Yeah, come on.
- Well.

06:43.696 --> 06:44.697
Come with us.

06:45.989 --> 06:46.531
- [Hannah] Do you promise it
will be nothing like last time?

06:46.532 --> 06:47.406
- I promise nothing!

06:47.407 --> 06:50.159
- [Voiceover] A few moments
later.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.789
(dramatic orchestral music)

06:56.416 --> 06:58.000
- Oo.
- Looks pretty clear!

06:58.001 --> 06:58.668
- Yeah.

06:58.669 --> 07:00.127
Oo, it's my tummy rumbling.

07:00.128 --> 07:00.753
- [Hannah] Okay, well I've
got a list.

07:00.754 --> 07:01.754
- Oh, good.
- Yeah?

07:01.755 --> 07:02.798
- [Hannah] The only thing is...

07:04.007 --> 07:04.508
Well I wrote it, but then
actually we need everything.

07:05.467 --> 07:07.635
So, the list is actually
everything.

07:07.636 --> 07:08.970
- Yeah, that's not really
specific.

07:08.971 --> 07:09.804
- Thanks, Hannah.

07:09.805 --> 07:10.847
Very useful.

07:10.848 --> 07:12.098
- I know it looks clear,

07:12.099 --> 07:12.724
but I'm just gonna send the
drone up.

07:12.725 --> 07:13.516
Get a bit of over watch.

07:13.517 --> 07:16.018
- Yes, please do.
- All right.

07:16.019 --> 07:18.187
- Does the drone make a lot of
noise?

07:18.188 --> 07:20.147
- Totally.

07:20.148 --> 07:22.734
- [Hannah] Well, this is
exciting.

07:22.735 --> 07:24.318
Why does this feel like
we're setting off a firework?

07:24.319 --> 07:25.570
- And away we go!

07:25.571 --> 07:29.031
(drone buzzing)

07:29.032 --> 07:30.325
- [Hannah] Wow!

07:31.535 --> 07:35.080
(dramatic orchestral music)

07:37.082 --> 07:38.290
How's it looking?

07:38.291 --> 07:40.543
- It's looking kinda clear.

07:40.544 --> 07:43.045
- What do you mean, kinda clear?

07:43.046 --> 07:44.213
- Apocalypse you know,
you never know.

07:44.214 --> 07:45.256
- Yeah.

07:45.257 --> 07:48.051
(drone buzzing)

07:50.428 --> 07:51.263
- Yeah, no, no.

07:51.597 --> 07:52.429
I think we're looking good.
- Sweet.

07:52.430 --> 07:54.932
- It's looking good.
- Okay, so.

07:54.933 --> 07:56.142
What's the plan?
- Yeah.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.644
- [Hannah] Well okay,
I'll tell you the plan.

07:57.645 --> 07:58.729
But you have to do the
planning music first,

07:59.104 --> 08:02.857
or it doesn't work.
- Yes, do the planning music.

08:02.858 --> 08:04.191
♪ Do, do, do, do, do, do ♪

08:04.192 --> 08:05.484
- [Hannah] Okay, so.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.485
Tony's gonna start with the
drone still.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.486
- Sure, yeah.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.531
- We're gonna send Tony in first

08:09.489 --> 08:09.532
- Yep, sure.
- Then what we're gonna do,

08:10.490 --> 08:11.490
is we're gonna go in together.
- Go in.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.491
- We're gonna grab all the
canned food,

08:12.492 --> 08:12.535
that we can get.
- All the canned food.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.244
- [Hannah] Anything that's in
a packet-

08:15.245 --> 08:15.328
- Packet.
- If you look at the expiry-

08:16.329 --> 08:17.371
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, sweet
child of mine.

08:17.372 --> 08:19.666
You realize this isn't
a supermarket, right?

08:19.667 --> 08:20.332
- What is it?

08:20.333 --> 08:21.751
- [Hannah] Where are we?

08:21.752 --> 08:23.002
- It's a garden centre.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.378
- A garden centre, Tony...

08:24.379 --> 08:26.338
- [Hannah] Why have you
brought us to a garden centre?

08:26.339 --> 08:28.841
- Cause we've ransacked
everything!

08:28.842 --> 08:33.011
Look, I've showed you
guys this loads of times!

08:33.013 --> 08:35.347
Red, red, red,
red, red, red, red.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.265
- Well we're here now,
so let's just go in

08:37.267 --> 08:38.475
and see what we can get.
- Yeah.

08:38.476 --> 08:39.519
Plus there's a weed stash
in here.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.395
- I knew it!
- Yeah.

08:41.395 --> 08:42.145
- I'm just gonna do one
last check.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.147
- Okay.

08:43.148 --> 08:46.777
(dramatic orchestral music)

08:49.279 --> 08:50.906
It's looking good.

08:53.075 --> 08:54.158
(zombie screaming)

08:54.159 --> 08:55.326
- Oh, shit.

08:55.327 --> 08:56.703
- What?

08:56.704 --> 08:58.495
- (whispers) Clown zombie.

08:58.496 --> 09:01.791
- Clown zombie, why'd it
have to be a clown zombie?

09:01.792 --> 09:03.501
- [Hannah] Why don't we
let you deal with that one?

09:03.502 --> 09:04.794
- Yes, you go first.

09:04.795 --> 09:05.336
- [Hannah] And if there's
any others,

09:05.337 --> 09:06.421
we'll deal with it.

09:07.422 --> 09:07.464
But you deal with that one.
- Yes, go on.

09:08.674 --> 09:09.799
- [Hannah] Happy for you
to take that off our hands.

09:09.800 --> 09:10.800
- Fine, just keep an over
watch on me would you?

09:10.801 --> 09:14.887
- Whoa, too much power,
too much power.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.055
Where's the self destruct button

09:16.056 --> 09:17.056
- There is not a self
destruct button.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.100
That's an urban legend.

09:19.351 --> 09:21.185
I don't put self destruct
buttons on absolutely everything

09:21.186 --> 09:22.854
Just the microwave.

09:22.855 --> 09:23.855
- [Hannah] Do not press it.

09:23.856 --> 09:25.397
Whatever it is, don't press it.

09:25.398 --> 09:28.569
(footsteps crunching)

09:32.197 --> 09:33.365
- [Tony] Ugh.

09:36.493 --> 09:39.204
(gun clicking)

09:40.330 --> 09:43.291
(gunshots firing)

09:57.305 --> 10:00.684
(footsteps crunching)

10:08.901 --> 10:12.029
(footsteps crunching)

10:14.865 --> 10:18.075
(dramatic orchestral music)

10:18.076 --> 10:20.871
(drone buzzing)

10:23.874 --> 10:24.791
- Pew, pew.

10:24.792 --> 10:25.876
Pew, pew, pew.

10:26.960 --> 10:27.376
- [Hannah] Well, we should
probably follow him.

10:27.377 --> 10:28.085
Come on.

10:28.086 --> 10:28.962
- I'm playing on this, now.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.088
- [Hannah] It's not a
computer game.

10:31.089 --> 10:33.132
It's a bloody drone!

10:33.133 --> 10:34.592
You're supposed to be using
it to keep an eye on him.

10:34.593 --> 10:36.052
- I am, I can see him.

10:36.053 --> 10:36.928
- [Hannah] Well, what
is he doing?

10:36.929 --> 10:37.637
Is he still in the box?

10:37.638 --> 10:39.597
- Uh, he's still in the box, yes

10:39.598 --> 10:40.807
- Well, why don't we just-
- The zombie hasn't seen him.

10:40.808 --> 10:41.641
- [Hannah] Look, it's taking
ages.

10:41.642 --> 10:42.726
Let's just hide in here.

10:43.936 --> 10:46.938
- He's gonna sneak up on it,
he's gonna sneak up on it.

10:46.939 --> 10:47.647
Okay, oo.

10:47.648 --> 10:48.481
- [Hannah] Shall we wait here?

10:48.982 --> 10:50.482
- It's like a greenhouse,
in here.

10:50.483 --> 10:54.154
(dramatic orchestral music)

10:56.532 --> 10:57.865
(zombie screaming)

10:57.866 --> 10:58.825
- Oo!
- Oo!

10:58.826 --> 11:00.577
Clean up on aisle three.

11:00.578 --> 11:02.036
- Yeah, that's gonna stain.

11:02.037 --> 11:05.165
(footsteps tapping)

11:07.167 --> 11:08.835
- [Tony] Oh, oh god.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.503
Kid zombies.

11:10.504 --> 11:13.339
So adorably terrifying.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.341
I can't shoot, I can't...

11:15.342 --> 11:17.009
Here, here, get the foot.

11:17.010 --> 11:17.719
Get the delicious foot.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.554
Get the foot, get the foot!

11:19.555 --> 11:22.558
(zombies groaning)

11:26.186 --> 11:27.520
- [Hannah] Is it Tony?

11:27.521 --> 11:28.563
- (whispers) No, it's a zombie.

11:28.564 --> 11:30.397
- [Hannah] Oh.

11:30.398 --> 11:33.109
(zombie groaning)

11:33.110 --> 11:34.360
Oh, wow.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.903
Imagine surviving 10 years,

11:35.904 --> 11:38.280
just to get eaten by a postman.

11:38.281 --> 11:39.574
Oh no, it's a granny!

11:39.575 --> 11:40.658
Oh, I can't film that.

11:40.659 --> 11:41.576
- [Miles] Probably best not.

11:41.577 --> 11:42.702
- No.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.495
Ugh!

11:44.496 --> 11:46.748
Cor, you're missing
something really grim here.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.499
Cor, he's really going for it,
isn't he?

11:48.500 --> 11:49.917
- [Miles] Does that look good
on camera?

11:49.918 --> 11:52.044
- I've turned it round,
you can't see.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.295
(gunshot firing)

11:53.296 --> 11:55.715
- Hey guys, what's happening?

11:55.716 --> 11:57.050
- Zombie postman.

11:58.969 --> 12:00.553
- Another one for the big book!

12:00.554 --> 12:04.223
Do you have any idea how
rare a postman zombie is?

12:04.224 --> 12:06.183
Nowhere near as bloody
common as hipster zombies.

12:06.184 --> 12:08.811
Those fuckers just spawn
everywhere.

12:08.812 --> 12:11.105
(zombie groaning)

12:11.106 --> 12:12.607
Man.

12:12.608 --> 12:14.817
Everything's coming up Milhouse,
today.

12:14.818 --> 12:15.693
- [Hannah] Well, that's
the only good thing

12:15.694 --> 12:16.695
that's come out of this.

12:17.738 --> 12:18.404
- Yeah, it's been a bit of
a waste of time

12:18.405 --> 12:18.946
to be honest, this trip.

12:18.947 --> 12:20.823
- Are you kidding me?

12:20.824 --> 12:22.449
I found some tomatoes,
over in the other shed.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.744
- Yeah, one tomato does not
a salad make.

12:24.745 --> 12:25.703
- Ah, I suppose.

12:25.704 --> 12:26.705
But come on guys,

12:27.915 --> 12:28.873
we need to start getting
outside of our comfort zone.

12:28.874 --> 12:29.874
We need to start thinking about
growing,

12:29.875 --> 12:32.334
and fertilization,
all that kinda shit.

12:32.335 --> 12:33.920
- Eh?
- Well, can you do that?

12:33.921 --> 12:35.963
And then we'll just
eat all the produce.

12:35.964 --> 12:37.089
- No, we've gotta do this stuff
together.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.591
Ride or die!

12:38.592 --> 12:42.136
- [Hannah] Or, have a
sit down and a Hobnob.

12:42.137 --> 12:43.846
- This is much better.

12:43.847 --> 12:45.848
- Yeah, we should do this
more often.

12:45.849 --> 12:48.017
A slower pace of life.

12:48.018 --> 12:49.769
- Mm, I dunno what
people are talking about.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.854
Zombie apocalypse,
is a piece of cake.

12:51.855 --> 12:53.439
- Ah, you had to say
piece of cake.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.398
I want a piece of cake, now.

12:54.399 --> 12:56.818
(all muttering)

12:56.819 --> 12:57.736
Whoa, shit!

12:59.822 --> 13:01.698
(gunshot firing)

13:01.699 --> 13:04.660
(upbeat rock music)

13:09.414 --> 13:12.292
(zombies groaning)

13:20.383 --> 13:22.635
- Okay, breaking into a car 101.

13:22.636 --> 13:24.929
- This is gonna be good.

13:24.930 --> 13:25.973
- Yeah, erm...

13:28.976 --> 13:31.770
(Tony groaning)

13:37.610 --> 13:38.818
- Oh, there's zombies over there

13:38.819 --> 13:40.987
So, you might wanna-
- What?

13:40.988 --> 13:43.030
You all right there, Tony?

13:43.031 --> 13:43.698
- I fell down.
- You okay?

13:43.699 --> 13:46.826
Yeah, can you hold this?

13:46.827 --> 13:47.869
Miles?

13:47.870 --> 13:48.704
Miles!

13:49.079 --> 13:50.830
You've accidentally
locked the door!

13:50.831 --> 13:51.748
Miles!

13:51.749 --> 13:52.833
- What?

13:53.917 --> 13:54.542
- [Hannah] You've
accidentally locked the door!

13:54.543 --> 13:56.252
- Oh, I dunno how to...

13:56.253 --> 13:58.505
How do you, er...
- Miles!

13:58.506 --> 14:00.422
Miles, I'm gonna smash your
gramophone to smithereens,

14:00.423 --> 14:03.384
if you don't let us in right now

14:03.385 --> 14:04.176
Come on.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.053
Come on you, it's time to get in

14:06.054 --> 14:09.682
Let's just get in there Tony,
come on.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.017
Tony, get in the car!

14:11.018 --> 14:12.727
Tony, get in the car!

14:12.728 --> 14:15.730
(zombies groaning)

14:15.731 --> 14:16.899
Close the door!

14:19.652 --> 14:21.945
- [Miles] You all right?

14:22.780 --> 14:24.823
Well, we're in the car!

14:26.534 --> 14:29.327
(zombies bashing)

14:32.873 --> 14:36.333
- Might put some music over
this bit, when I've finished.

14:36.334 --> 14:39.086
Editing it, make it a
bit more interesting.

14:39.087 --> 14:42.507
God, feels like we've been
in here for about a year!

14:42.508 --> 14:44.383
I need a wee.
- Again?

14:44.384 --> 14:45.385
- Yeah, listen.

14:46.512 --> 14:48.470
Can I swap you the camera
for the pee bottle?

14:48.471 --> 14:50.473
I'll make another funnel.

14:51.517 --> 14:52.560
Thanks.

14:53.769 --> 14:54.435
- I object to the lack of
dignity, in this situation.

14:54.436 --> 14:56.564
- [Hannah] Oh, it's warm.

14:57.648 --> 14:59.023
- Hello, beautiful.

14:59.024 --> 15:00.149
- [Miles] Oh god, what have you

15:00.150 --> 15:02.026
Brain eating zombie?

15:02.027 --> 15:04.236
- Dude I've told you, brain
eating zombies aren't real.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.404
- Yeah, but there's a
whole section in your book

15:05.405 --> 15:07.073
devoted to running zombies.

15:07.074 --> 15:07.908
- That's because I know

15:08.325 --> 15:09.283
those diarrhea inducing dicks
are real.

15:09.284 --> 15:10.702
I mean, brain eating zombies,

15:10.703 --> 15:12.494
what are the gonna do,
go to school?

15:12.495 --> 15:15.414
- [Miles] There are no fast
bastards.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.624
- Fastards.

15:16.625 --> 15:18.793
- [Miles] But I tell you
what, it's not going in here.

15:18.794 --> 15:20.753
I object.
- Hey!

15:20.754 --> 15:21.671
- [Miles] You'll thank me later.

15:21.672 --> 15:24.131
So, what's the latest
acquisition?

15:24.132 --> 15:25.257
- Stripper zombie.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.426
- Oh really, where?

15:27.427 --> 15:30.472
(window squeaking)

15:34.434 --> 15:37.311
That is one grizzly back story.

15:37.312 --> 15:39.856
- [Tony] It's not the cheap
gag you're looking for is it?

15:39.857 --> 15:42.399
(camera whirring)

15:42.400 --> 15:44.193
While er, while that develops,
Hannah.

15:44.194 --> 15:45.737
Is there any point in asking,

15:45.738 --> 15:47.404
if you're anywhere near
pissing yet?

15:47.405 --> 15:49.073
- I can't, they're all looking
at me.

15:49.074 --> 15:50.534
- Well, obviously.

15:52.202 --> 15:54.286
So, this book of yours Tony.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.539
What are all this little
symbols, and stuff?

15:56.540 --> 15:59.626
- Oh er, methods of dispatch
tested.

15:59.627 --> 16:01.460
- [Miles] Right, so that one.

16:01.461 --> 16:02.587
What's that one?

16:02.588 --> 16:03.421
- Abacus.

16:04.965 --> 16:08.050
- [Miles] So, you killed
a banker with an abacus?

16:08.051 --> 16:10.136
- A banker zombie, but yeah.
- Oh, right.

16:10.137 --> 16:12.930
We'll there's a kind of poetic
justice to that, isn't there?

16:12.931 --> 16:14.098
- Oh, oh god.

16:14.099 --> 16:17.602
- [Miles] What, what,
what, what?

16:17.603 --> 16:19.729
- It's Alan.
- Who?

16:19.730 --> 16:21.606
- Alan Grenadehand.

16:21.607 --> 16:23.482
I gaffer taped a grenade
to his hand five years ago,

16:23.483 --> 16:25.860
and the fucker's had it
in for me ever since.

16:25.861 --> 16:28.988
- [Miles] Tony,
why did you do that?

16:28.989 --> 16:30.322
- The lols?

16:30.323 --> 16:31.658
He's got a big,
solid death grip on that.

16:31.659 --> 16:33.159
I mean, as long as he
maintains it.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.745
We're probably gonna be fine.

16:35.746 --> 16:36.705
- [All] Ah!

16:38.331 --> 16:41.084
(pee trickling)

16:42.545 --> 16:44.712
- I think we have to get
out of here, now.

16:44.713 --> 16:46.673
- What is he doing?

16:46.674 --> 16:48.508
- Meat drone.
- Meat drone?

16:48.509 --> 16:51.427
- Yeah, I mean I was planning
on using it for a barbecue,

16:51.428 --> 16:53.680
but needs must, we're in
a bit of a pickle here.

16:53.681 --> 16:55.765
- Okay, those are gonna have
been frozen for about 10 years.

16:55.766 --> 16:57.266
You can't eat those now, Tony.
- No, that's okay!

16:57.267 --> 16:58.768
You can freeze meat for 10 years

16:58.769 --> 16:59.727
- [Miles] We can freeze
meat for 10 years,

16:59.728 --> 17:01.145
but you can't eat it after
10 years.

17:01.146 --> 17:02.146
- I mean it's been in
the freezer,

17:02.147 --> 17:03.230
connected to a solar panel.

17:03.231 --> 17:04.273
I mean, it'll be fine.

17:05.568 --> 17:06.442
And like, I can eat this stuff
all the time, and I'm good.

17:06.443 --> 17:07.108
- [Miles] How are you
still alive?

17:07.109 --> 17:08.653
Two or three months tops,

17:08.654 --> 17:09.319
for frozen food.
- Yeah.

17:09.320 --> 17:10.573
Two or three, for chicken.

17:11.781 --> 17:12.281
- It's like a really hardy
immune system, you know.

17:13.282 --> 17:13.907
- [Miles] Why don't I
distract them, right?

17:13.909 --> 17:15.034
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

17:15.035 --> 17:16.242
I'll beep the horn, okay.

17:16.243 --> 17:17.619
- Yeah, we just distract

17:17.621 --> 17:18.496
and get all these guys
at the front.

17:19.372 --> 17:19.957
And we send this out the back.
- Okay.

17:20.958 --> 17:21.624
- And it just draws them away-
- Yeah, but-

17:21.625 --> 17:22.375
- But, I could beep the horn.

17:23.417 --> 17:23.919
- Well I'll beep the horn.
- Yeah, but I-

17:24.920 --> 17:24.962
- [Miles] In fact,
I've got the horn.

17:26.046 --> 17:26.546
I've got the horn.
- Yeah, but I'm the driver.

17:26.547 --> 17:27.589
I'm the driver!

17:28.507 --> 17:28.966
- Let's just fruit one, two,
three it.

17:29.967 --> 17:30.008
- [Miles] Fruit, one, two,
three, okay.

17:31.176 --> 17:31.676
- Fruit, one, two, three.
- All right, all right.

17:31.677 --> 17:32.426
One, two, three.

17:32.427 --> 17:33.761
- [Miles And Tony] Bananas!

17:33.762 --> 17:35.012
- Pear, oh fuck.

17:35.013 --> 17:36.097
- Every time.
- Okay, cool.

17:36.098 --> 17:37.431
- Every time.
- Let's do this.

17:37.432 --> 17:38.057
- You guys always say
banana, and-

17:38.058 --> 17:38.725
- [Miles] Okay, right.

17:38.726 --> 17:39.727
You ready?

17:40.728 --> 17:41.227
- No, we're committed,
we're committed.

17:41.228 --> 17:41.812
(horn beeping)

17:42.813 --> 17:43.771
- Hang on, just let me
get in the back.

17:43.772 --> 17:44.480
Just let me-
- She's getting out the back.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.524
- [Tony] I'm lighting her way.

17:46.525 --> 17:48.192
- Just let me...

17:48.193 --> 17:50.236
- [Tony] Oh, they're
getting a bit angrier now.

17:50.237 --> 17:51.738
- [Miles] They're gathering,
they're gathering.

17:51.739 --> 17:52.822
Are they gonna come
through that windscreen?

17:52.823 --> 17:54.616
- Oh no, it's working,
it's working.

17:54.617 --> 17:55.700
- [Miles] Oh, she's out,
she's out!

17:55.701 --> 17:56.909
Pass her the drone.
- Here, here.

17:56.910 --> 17:57.994
- Take the meat, take the meat!

17:57.995 --> 17:58.828
- [Miles] Release the meat!

17:58.829 --> 17:59.871
Release the meat!

17:59.872 --> 18:01.873
- Chicken wings?

18:01.874 --> 18:02.833
- Okay, okay.

18:03.959 --> 18:05.960
- [Hannah] Yeah, it's up.

18:05.961 --> 18:06.836
It's up.

18:06.837 --> 18:07.754
- Oh, they're noticing.

18:07.755 --> 18:08.796
They're noticing, look.

18:08.797 --> 18:09.506
Look, look.
- Is it working?

18:09.507 --> 18:10.006
- Okay look, they can see it!

18:10.007 --> 18:12.466
They can see it!

18:12.467 --> 18:13.968
Look, they're noticing,
they're noticing.

18:13.969 --> 18:14.677
They're moving off.

18:14.678 --> 18:16.596
Look, look.

18:16.597 --> 18:18.765
- Wow, I really didn't think
the plan was gonna work.

18:18.766 --> 18:19.808
- [Miles] No.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.018
It didn't have a good
chance of working, did it?

18:22.019 --> 18:24.854
- Oh look, she really
wants those chicken wings.

18:24.855 --> 18:26.147
- [Tony] I really want
those chicken wings.

18:26.148 --> 18:26.856
- [Miles] You don't, Tony.

18:26.857 --> 18:29.734
Three months, remember we said?

18:29.735 --> 18:32.194
- You know, this whole episode
has been really distressing.

18:32.195 --> 18:33.070
We could have died.

18:33.071 --> 18:35.156
- Never could the
hang of Thursdays.

18:35.157 --> 18:37.742
- Yeah, a few close shaves
for the blog, there.

18:37.743 --> 18:39.786
- Well I don't think a blog
really covers it, anymore.

18:39.787 --> 18:41.203
You know, the a stuff we've seen

18:41.204 --> 18:42.622
And the things that we've
survived.

18:42.623 --> 18:44.541
I just feel like,
if we'd have died.

18:44.542 --> 18:46.458
What would be have to
show for it?

18:46.459 --> 18:48.586
Hundreds of hours of
knitting tutorials.

18:48.587 --> 18:50.713
And a book review blog,
that only Tony watches.

18:50.714 --> 18:51.632
Thanks, Tony.

18:52.925 --> 18:54.926
You know, we used to be
film students.

18:54.927 --> 18:57.219
Maybe we should make a film.

18:57.220 --> 18:59.096
Maybe we should make a film.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.932
Just a true account of the
last 10 years.

19:00.933 --> 19:02.559
Like a monument to our survival.

19:02.560 --> 19:04.435
- What, like "10 Years a
Zombie Survivor"?

19:04.436 --> 19:06.478
- Well yeah, but maybe with
a better title than that.

19:06.479 --> 19:09.273
- I can't think of a worse
title than "Zomblogalypse".

19:09.274 --> 19:10.858
- Hannah's right, though.

19:10.859 --> 19:12.569
We've had a lot of great
shenanigans in the apocalypse.

19:12.570 --> 19:14.904
We can make an awesome
movie out of that.

19:14.905 --> 19:16.405
Just minus all the boring
bits, like the pooing.

19:16.406 --> 19:17.657
- Hey, I like the pooing.

19:17.658 --> 19:19.075
- Yeah, I love pooing.

19:19.076 --> 19:20.242
- Fine, you guys can make
a movie about pooing.

19:20.243 --> 19:22.203
I'm gonna make 90 minutes
of exploding fun times.

19:22.204 --> 19:24.080
- Okay, well we can't make
three different films.

19:24.081 --> 19:25.331
We all have to make the
same film, obviously.

19:25.332 --> 19:26.833
- Okay, well we'll all work
together then.

19:26.834 --> 19:27.709
- All right!
- Yeah!

19:27.710 --> 19:28.876
- Team Zomblog.

19:28.877 --> 19:29.669
- Team Zomblog!
- We're a crew!

19:29.670 --> 19:30.504
- [All] Yeah!

19:30.838 --> 19:32.004
Sorry, well we can work
on that bit.

19:32.005 --> 19:32.672
- I'll get Tony Droney
back to us.

19:32.673 --> 19:33.840
- Okay.

19:33.841 --> 19:34.841
- You call your drone
Tony Droney?

19:34.842 --> 19:36.008
- What else would you call it?

19:36.009 --> 19:38.010
- Teeny tiny Tony Droneykins.

19:38.011 --> 19:40.179
- Er, a slight problem.

19:40.180 --> 19:41.347
They followed the drone.

19:41.348 --> 19:43.058
- Oh my god.
- "Merde"!

19:44.184 --> 19:45.434
- Turn the drone off,
turn it off!

19:45.435 --> 19:46.519
- I can't the battery's died.

19:46.520 --> 19:47.729
It's set to return to home!

19:47.730 --> 19:49.105
- Well, how fast can it go?

19:49.106 --> 19:50.607
- 40 miles an hour!
- Why?

19:50.608 --> 19:53.527
(Tony screaming)

19:56.780 --> 19:59.782
(door crashing)

19:59.783 --> 20:01.283
- Think this is all the cast
and crew we're gonna need.

20:01.284 --> 20:02.201
- [Miles] Yeah, they're
not exactly

20:02.202 --> 20:03.786
gonna form a zombie union.

20:03.787 --> 20:05.037
- [Hannah] Well this
means, we can make a movie.

20:05.038 --> 20:07.582
(all cheering)

20:07.583 --> 20:11.419
(dramatic orchestral music)

20:17.551 --> 20:19.761
- And action!
- Action.

20:19.762 --> 20:22.680
(upbeat dance music)

20:22.681 --> 20:23.430
- Come on!

20:23.431 --> 20:25.224
- Yes, let's get the survivors.

20:25.225 --> 20:26.142
- Yes, they're over there.

20:26.143 --> 20:27.143
Let's kill them!

20:27.144 --> 20:28.185
- That's my line.

20:28.186 --> 20:29.061
The survivors are over there!

20:29.062 --> 20:29.896
- Let's kill them.

20:29.897 --> 20:30.938
- They're over there.

20:30.939 --> 20:31.606
- No, let's save them.

20:31.607 --> 20:32.565
Save them.

20:32.566 --> 20:34.275
God, this boom operator is shit!

20:34.276 --> 20:34.943
- No!

20:36.486 --> 20:37.737
Can you hold that, while
I sort the boom out?

20:37.738 --> 20:38.696
I think it's all right.

20:38.697 --> 20:40.949
- [Miles] Oh no, no, no, no.

20:44.494 --> 20:46.788
No look, this way, this way.

20:46.789 --> 20:47.705
This way.

20:47.706 --> 20:49.040
- It's just...

20:49.041 --> 20:50.876
Like that, like that.

20:53.003 --> 20:54.629
(camera crashing)

20:54.630 --> 20:58.008
(upbeat dance music)

21:00.511 --> 21:03.514
(gunshots firing)

21:04.515 --> 21:06.766
- Well, I guess these zombies...

21:06.767 --> 21:07.684
- [Both] Have missed
their ticket.

21:07.685 --> 21:08.768
- No, I'm saying it.
- No, I'm saying it.

21:08.769 --> 21:10.186
- No-
- No, oh yeah.

21:10.187 --> 21:11.103
Cause I was gonna say...

21:11.104 --> 21:12.354
- Okay, fine, fine, fine.

21:12.355 --> 21:13.856
Well, I guess these zombi...

21:13.857 --> 21:15.024
Sorry, I'll wait.
- Okay.

21:15.025 --> 21:16.317
- Well I guess these zombies...

21:16.318 --> 21:18.069
- [Both] Have missed
their ticket.

21:18.070 --> 21:20.698
(gunshots firing)

21:22.157 --> 21:25.743
(gunshots firing)

21:25.744 --> 21:27.537
- Guys?

21:27.538 --> 21:29.706
I think we're going to need
some help on this project.

21:29.707 --> 21:32.750
- What about like, one of
those kick go-go things?

21:32.751 --> 21:35.587
- You really wanna drag other
people into this debacle?

21:35.588 --> 21:37.797
- Well maybe they'll help, if
we make it worth their while.

21:37.798 --> 21:40.091
It's all about the perks,
these days.

21:40.092 --> 21:41.968
- I'm sorry, but I don't think
people are gonna get involved

21:41.969 --> 21:45.096
for a badge, and a thank
you in the credits.

21:45.097 --> 21:46.138
- Okay, well that's not quite
what I mean.

21:46.139 --> 21:47.557
If you think about all the stuff

21:47.558 --> 21:49.726
we used to take for granted,
before the apocalypse.

21:49.727 --> 21:50.894
- Bum scrape!

21:51.937 --> 21:52.937
- What?

21:52.938 --> 21:54.897
- He means bog roll.
- Yes, yeah.

21:54.898 --> 21:55.815
Creature comforts, exactly.

21:55.816 --> 21:58.025
So, food and shelter.

21:58.026 --> 21:59.819
Sanitary towels?

21:59.820 --> 22:02.321
I think if somebody offered
me a fresh wet wipe, I'd cry.

22:02.322 --> 22:03.490
- So, let me get this straight.

22:04.658 --> 22:06.033
We offer a bunch of stuff,
we may or may not have.

22:06.034 --> 22:07.077
To a bunch of people

22:08.161 --> 22:09.328
who may, or may not
survive the apocalypse.

22:09.329 --> 22:11.247
And in return, they give
us their precious time?

22:11.248 --> 22:13.541
- [Tony] Yay, capitalism lives!

22:13.542 --> 22:16.085
- Okay, let's make the perks
video then!

22:16.086 --> 22:17.670
- Well, have you got any ideas?

22:17.671 --> 22:19.213
- I have any ideas.

22:19.214 --> 22:22.510
(gentle folk music)

22:24.678 --> 22:25.387
Greetings.

22:26.514 --> 22:28.180
That all right?

22:28.181 --> 22:30.517
My name is Miles...

22:30.518 --> 22:34.605
Watts, Poppington, Earl
Gray, the Third, Esquire.

22:35.814 --> 22:36.690
Of life.

22:38.275 --> 22:39.442
I come to you...

22:42.195 --> 22:43.071
I come to you.

22:45.365 --> 22:48.242
I come to you, with
an opportunity...

22:48.243 --> 22:49.745
With an opportunity.

22:54.207 --> 22:57.002
An opportunity to live, like me.

22:58.253 --> 23:01.214
In this glorious,
natural surrounding.

23:03.341 --> 23:04.384
We're about the embark

23:05.343 --> 23:06.761
on the most ambitious film,
ever made.

23:06.762 --> 23:08.888
Howard Hughes was a weakling.

23:08.889 --> 23:11.182
James Cameron is a peasant.

23:11.183 --> 23:13.935
None of them possess
the steel, and integrity

23:13.936 --> 23:16.228
of the project, that
we're about the embark on.

23:16.229 --> 23:19.065
A cinematic account of
the last decade.

23:19.066 --> 23:20.900
A decade that changed
the world, if you will.

23:20.901 --> 23:22.527
A film 10 years in the making,

23:22.528 --> 23:25.530
that will reach the very
summit of the filmic arts.

23:25.531 --> 23:26.906
But we need your help.

23:26.907 --> 23:28.700
A mountain cannot be
built in a day.

23:28.701 --> 23:30.660
Well obviously, you don't
build mountains, do you.

23:30.661 --> 23:31.911
- Yeah, I know.

23:31.912 --> 23:33.370
But it makes sense
with the next bit.

23:33.371 --> 23:35.414
- And neither can a movie.
- See?

23:35.415 --> 23:37.083
- We need your help.

23:37.084 --> 23:40.336
So pick a perk, and
donate to us your skills.

23:40.337 --> 23:41.505
Perks include...

23:43.757 --> 23:45.341
A great big, fuck off tank.

23:45.342 --> 23:47.677
For Sunday drives,
and smooshing things.

23:47.678 --> 23:48.804
Easy peelers!

23:49.972 --> 23:51.848
Cause something in this
apocalypse, has to be simple.

23:51.849 --> 23:53.808
A combine harvester.

23:53.809 --> 23:55.935
Don't know what the fuck
it's for, but it looks cool.

23:55.936 --> 23:58.772
A lifetime supply of wagyu beef!

23:59.773 --> 24:01.024
And a traffic cone.

24:02.275 --> 24:04.026
Because no nuclear bunker,
is complete without one.

24:04.027 --> 24:05.570
Just donate your time.

24:05.571 --> 24:07.905
And we'll make the rest
of your miserable lives,

24:07.906 --> 24:10.158
a lot less miserable-er.

24:11.326 --> 24:14.871
Donate, and be a part of history

24:14.872 --> 24:15.913
(gunshot firing)

24:15.914 --> 24:16.914
(zombie groaning)

24:16.915 --> 24:19.083
Or, be its dinner!

24:19.084 --> 24:21.085
See, pretty good.

24:21.086 --> 24:22.087
- I don't know.

24:23.088 --> 24:24.088
I feel like we might be
overselling it.

24:24.089 --> 24:25.923
- Look, just get the campaign
online now.

24:25.924 --> 24:27.967
And then we'll worry
about that shit, later.

24:27.968 --> 24:29.051
- Okay.
- Just press that.

24:29.052 --> 24:30.219
- Yeah, all right.

24:30.220 --> 24:30.720
- And that.
- Can you just...

24:30.721 --> 24:31.596
Yeah, I know.

24:31.597 --> 24:32.722
I know how to do it!

24:32.723 --> 24:35.267
- All right.
- I've done it wrong.

24:36.894 --> 24:38.311
Oh, look!
- Shit.

24:39.730 --> 24:40.606
- Oh.

24:41.899 --> 24:42.775
Oh, wow.

24:44.985 --> 24:45.693
Oh my god.

24:45.694 --> 24:47.862
- Well, that escalated quickly.

24:47.863 --> 24:49.656
- We can't deliver this.

24:49.657 --> 24:51.741
I mean, I might be able to
paint some bog roll gold.

24:51.742 --> 24:54.702
But, where are we gonna
get a nuclear bunker?

24:54.703 --> 24:55.912
- We'll just get one.

24:55.913 --> 24:57.372
It's the apocalypse, you know.

24:58.666 --> 24:59.165
And then we'll clear it out,
and we'll give it to a donor.

24:59.166 --> 25:00.875
- Can't we keep it?

25:00.876 --> 25:02.919
- It's not a pet.

25:02.920 --> 25:05.547
What if we can't deliver
the perks?

25:05.548 --> 25:07.214
- We can't deliver the perks.

25:07.215 --> 25:08.215
- What's it matter, anyway?

25:08.216 --> 25:10.385
I mean, what they gonna do?

25:12.012 --> 25:12.846
Eat us?

25:23.857 --> 25:25.066
- So, intros.

25:25.067 --> 25:26.818
Right, I'm Hannah.
- Hi.

25:26.819 --> 25:27.902
- This is Miles.
- Hi.

25:27.903 --> 25:28.946
- This is Tony.

25:30.155 --> 25:31.155
We're the writers, directors
and stars of the film.

25:31.156 --> 25:33.115
- I'm sure it's gonna be
well worth it,

25:33.116 --> 25:34.576
and we're all gonna have a
lovely time.

25:34.577 --> 25:35.868
And we'll all be alive...

25:35.869 --> 25:37.161
I mean, we'll all learn
something

25:37.162 --> 25:38.746
by the end of the experience.

25:38.747 --> 25:40.456
- Yeah, it was great to
see such a huge response

25:40.457 --> 25:41.874
to the online campaign.

25:41.875 --> 25:43.585
So, I'm not sure why the
internet's still working.

25:43.586 --> 25:46.462
If it's sort of lightning, or
goblins, or whatever it is.

25:46.463 --> 25:47.506
However it works.

25:48.757 --> 25:50.633
But if it means we can make
this film, we don't care!

25:50.634 --> 25:52.176
Still a lot of trolls
in the comment section,

25:52.177 --> 25:53.053
but, you know.

25:53.637 --> 25:54.303
Never mind.
- Yeah, just ignore them.

25:54.304 --> 25:55.347
- Well, to be honest,

25:56.557 --> 25:57.765
I'm still struggling with
why anybody would give a fuck

25:57.766 --> 26:00.476
about wanting to make a
film about the apocalypse,

26:00.477 --> 26:02.228
during the apocalypse.

26:02.229 --> 26:04.355
- Oh who's doing that,
that sounds good.

26:04.356 --> 26:05.607
- Look, I don't really care.

26:05.608 --> 26:09.777
Where's the steak and nuclear
bunker at?

26:09.778 --> 26:11.529
- Steak and other
associated perks,

26:11.530 --> 26:14.031
will be rewarded upon
completion of the final film.

26:14.032 --> 26:15.116
Thank you very much.

26:15.117 --> 26:16.159
- You might notice as well,

26:17.369 --> 26:18.035
we've got a few documentary
people filming and stuff.

26:18.036 --> 26:20.287
It's not just for posterity.

26:20.288 --> 26:21.998
We promised a making of on the
Blu-ray.

26:21.999 --> 26:23.457
So, we are stuck with them.

26:23.458 --> 26:26.043
The DVD is vanilla though,
B.T.dubs.

26:26.044 --> 26:27.294
- I don't think anyone
really cares

26:27.295 --> 26:29.421
about DVD special features,

26:29.422 --> 26:30.673
it's the fucking apocalypse.

26:30.674 --> 26:31.674
- Okay, look.

26:31.675 --> 26:32.760
It might be the apocalypse,

26:33.761 --> 26:35.011
but the format wars will
never be over.

26:35.012 --> 26:37.680
I'm guessing you did not opt
for a physical media package?

26:37.681 --> 26:39.849
- My partner and I,
selected the premium...

26:39.850 --> 26:41.142
- Platinum.

26:41.143 --> 26:43.269
- Platinum producer offer.

26:43.270 --> 26:44.854
- Oo, big spenders!

26:44.855 --> 26:47.148
- Well, it's been 10 years,

26:47.149 --> 26:50.234
and entertainment is in
short supply,

26:50.235 --> 26:52.904
so this should be entertaining.

26:52.905 --> 26:54.239
If nothing else.

26:55.407 --> 26:56.490
- You'd hope so.

26:56.491 --> 26:59.577
- Will there be on-set catering?

26:59.578 --> 27:01.078
- Yes.

27:01.079 --> 27:03.205
- Will there be a vegan option?

27:03.206 --> 27:07.585
- Erm, I think there
might be a couple cans

27:07.586 --> 27:09.629
of numberetti spaghetti
lying around.

27:09.630 --> 27:11.631
- Oo, oo, that actually is vegan

27:11.632 --> 27:12.590
- Oh, great.
- There you go.

27:12.591 --> 27:14.133
Numbers, great for vegans.
- Helpful.

27:14.134 --> 27:15.635
- Who knew?
- Thank you.

27:15.636 --> 27:16.886
- I suspected.

27:16.887 --> 27:18.429
- Okay, why don't we do
a table read?

27:18.430 --> 27:20.598
And everyone can just sort
of, put their hands up

27:20.599 --> 27:21.808
as we go, and we can
just dish out roles...

27:21.809 --> 27:22.810
Yeah, does that sound good?

27:23.811 --> 27:24.102
- Yeah, that sounds like a
good idea.

27:25.062 --> 27:26.604
So Tony, script.
- Get the script.

27:26.605 --> 27:28.064
Remember with the-
- What, now?

27:28.065 --> 27:29.106
- If you'd like to get the
script, you've prepared.

27:29.107 --> 27:33.027
For the notes, that you've-
- Oh. (laughs)

27:33.028 --> 27:34.320
I did that, didn't I?

27:34.321 --> 27:35.487
- Yeah you did, yeah.
- Did you though?

27:35.488 --> 27:37.032
- Yeah, one sec.

27:40.327 --> 27:40.993
- [Hannah] Oh, you want to
get more out.

27:40.994 --> 27:42.662
- [Miles] Oh right, okay, oh.

27:42.663 --> 27:43.330
Right.

27:44.414 --> 27:45.497
- [Hannah] Great, oh
he did do it.

27:45.498 --> 27:46.498
- Good, that's good, yes.

27:46.499 --> 27:48.000
- Bit of a work in progress.

27:48.001 --> 27:50.003
- I'll share it with you.

27:51.004 --> 27:52.254
Can I share it with you?

27:52.255 --> 27:54.256
- [Miles] You can share my
script if you like, yes.

27:54.257 --> 27:56.676
(papers rustling)

27:56.677 --> 27:58.511
- It's five pages long.

27:58.512 --> 28:00.054
- Like I said, work in progress.

28:00.055 --> 28:01.848
It's the first draft,
chill your boots!

28:01.849 --> 28:03.683
- Miles, do you want to do it?

28:03.684 --> 28:05.226
Cause you can do that
thing, with your voice.

28:05.227 --> 28:07.729
- Oh yeah, the thing
with my voice.

28:07.730 --> 28:09.522
Act one, scene one.

28:09.523 --> 28:11.899
Nah, I can't do that. (coughs)

28:11.900 --> 28:12.943
The beginning.

28:13.986 --> 28:14.485
God, you can tell
you wrote this, Tony.

28:14.486 --> 28:15.028
- [Hannah] Yeah.

28:16.071 --> 28:18.573
- The Saga Begins,
intro the Zombloggers.

28:18.574 --> 28:20.324
Hanging in their flat,
generally being cool.

28:20.325 --> 28:21.784
- Being cool.

28:21.785 --> 28:23.452
- Excuse me.

28:23.453 --> 28:26.914
Is the flat gonna be a
set, or an actual location?

28:26.915 --> 28:28.457
Just cause, you know.

28:28.458 --> 28:30.126
I'm a bit scared to go outside.

28:30.127 --> 28:33.505
It's quite harrowing, out there.

28:33.506 --> 28:35.757
- Well, seeing as we don't
want any of you in our home.

28:35.758 --> 28:37.299
Yes, it will probably be a set,

28:37.300 --> 28:40.887
- Okay, and who's building that?

28:40.888 --> 28:42.138
- You?

28:42.139 --> 28:43.265
- Me?

28:44.432 --> 28:44.974
- I just thought that's
why you kept interrupting.

28:44.975 --> 28:45.975
- No, I don't know-

28:45.976 --> 28:47.852
- Great right,
you're building the set.

28:47.853 --> 28:49.186
Let's see, where are we?

28:49.187 --> 28:51.355
The Zombloggers are
being awesome.

28:51.356 --> 28:54.025
- Are you gonna be
wearing your own clothes?

28:54.026 --> 28:55.151
- Oh, for fuck sake.

28:55.152 --> 28:56.944
Will the questions never end?

28:56.945 --> 28:58.571
I'm just gonna be wearing
this shit.

28:58.572 --> 28:59.989
You know, and you can sort
out your costumes, right?

28:59.990 --> 29:02.909
- Yeah oo, could I get
like, a viking helmet?

29:02.910 --> 29:04.036
But, without the horns.

29:05.162 --> 29:06.245
It turns out, that's actually
a factual inaccuracy.

29:06.246 --> 29:07.288
- Okay.

29:07.289 --> 29:08.748
- You're a factual inaccuracy.

29:08.749 --> 29:09.666
We don't hold that against you.

29:09.667 --> 29:11.292
Hannah, do you want to chime in?

29:11.293 --> 29:12.919
- Just don't make me
take my glasses off.

29:12.920 --> 29:15.004
- Why would I make you
take your glasses off?

29:15.005 --> 29:17.089
- I thought you were in
charge of costume?

29:17.090 --> 29:17.965
- No, erm...

29:17.966 --> 29:19.926
I was just asking.

29:19.927 --> 29:20.843
- Well, why are you asking us?

29:20.844 --> 29:21.845
It's your job.

29:24.264 --> 29:25.182
- Right, back to the script.

29:25.473 --> 29:27.016
The Zombloggers continue
to be awesome.

29:27.017 --> 29:28.935
Their boring housemate Adam,
appears.

29:28.936 --> 29:29.686
We need someone to play that,

29:29.687 --> 29:30.603
don't we?
- Oh, yeah.

29:30.604 --> 29:32.354
- Oh, I quite like acting.

29:32.355 --> 29:33.524
In fact, I...

29:34.692 --> 29:36.859
Had a reoccurring character
as a rent boy,

29:36.860 --> 29:38.570
in Coronation Street.

29:38.571 --> 29:39.237
And my...

29:40.405 --> 29:41.906
Coriolanus was...

29:41.907 --> 29:42.990
Award winning.

29:42.991 --> 29:44.992
- You do have a beard, so...

29:44.993 --> 29:46.410
I mean that could work, yeah.
- Adam didn't have a beard.

29:46.411 --> 29:47.453
So, what's that got to do with
anything?

29:47.454 --> 29:48.412
- Oh, shh.

29:48.413 --> 29:50.456
Take your hat off, maybe?

29:50.457 --> 29:51.624
Yeah, just take it off.

29:51.625 --> 29:54.711
And we can see, just so...

29:54.712 --> 29:56.588
Oh yeah, no you could play Adam.

29:56.589 --> 29:57.590
He could play Adam.

29:58.465 --> 29:59.591
Don't you think?
- Very lustrous.

29:59.592 --> 30:00.091
- Oh yeah, I think he
should play Adam, you know.

30:00.092 --> 30:00.133
- Yeah, whatever.

30:01.426 --> 30:02.927
- I mean, you get eaten by
zombies, but it's a good role.

30:02.928 --> 30:03.470
- I might be asking for this,

30:04.471 --> 30:06.097
but how are you gonna do
the zombies?

30:06.098 --> 30:09.100
- Er, we're not gonna "do" the
zombies.

30:09.101 --> 30:11.227
- No, I mean...

30:11.228 --> 30:15.272
Are you planning on using
real zombies, in your film?

30:15.273 --> 30:16.608
- Well, yeah.
- Yeah.

30:16.609 --> 30:19.026
- Yeah, they're also really
dangerous!

30:19.027 --> 30:20.528
- Well, that's the fun part.

30:20.529 --> 30:21.821
That's the, erm...

30:21.822 --> 30:23.573
Oh what do they call it,
it's the...

30:23.574 --> 30:24.407
The frisson!

30:27.494 --> 30:30.747
(Pete stutters)

30:30.748 --> 30:32.206
- I don't care how good your
film is,

30:32.207 --> 30:34.208
nobody wants to die for it.

30:34.209 --> 30:36.210
- Oh my god, what a kill joy.

30:36.211 --> 30:37.254
Okay fine, right.

30:38.380 --> 30:40.089
We'll stick green paint
and a wig on that guy.

30:40.090 --> 30:41.090
And we'll just, you know.

30:41.091 --> 30:42.675
He can stand in for them.

30:42.676 --> 30:43.718
You know, if it's good enough
for Romero,

30:43.719 --> 30:44.595
it is good enough for us.

30:45.178 --> 30:46.888
All right, Mr. Health and
Safety Pants?

30:46.889 --> 30:48.430
- What, so I'm in charge
of health and safety?

30:48.431 --> 30:49.599
- [Hannah, Miles And Tony] Yes!

30:49.600 --> 30:51.017
- Right, so we're in town.

30:51.018 --> 30:53.561
And zombies are eating Adam's
face off.

30:53.562 --> 30:54.437
- That's you.

30:54.813 --> 30:55.730
- But we'll use a stunt face
for that,

30:55.731 --> 30:56.774
so don't worry about that.

30:58.025 --> 30:58.358
And then the script sort of
runs out then, doesn't it.

30:59.442 --> 31:00.568
And it says, well we
meet a load of survivors.

31:00.569 --> 31:02.028
They're shit, we're great.

31:02.029 --> 31:03.320
We live, they don't.

31:03.321 --> 31:05.031
And then, that can be played
by you lot!

31:05.032 --> 31:06.074
- So, erm...

31:07.242 --> 31:09.326
What about the ending?

31:09.327 --> 31:10.620
- Well, life doesn't have
an ending.

31:10.621 --> 31:12.329
- Yeah, but.

31:12.330 --> 31:13.998
Except that it does.

31:13.999 --> 31:16.208
And it, erm...

31:16.209 --> 31:19.712
It usually involves teeth,
around here.

31:19.713 --> 31:21.463
- Well, this is an
active document.

31:21.464 --> 31:22.840
So, the film's just gonna stop.

31:22.841 --> 31:24.425
Because we're all still here.

31:24.426 --> 31:26.385
Beyond the end of days.

31:26.386 --> 31:27.679
- We'll blow something
up at the end,

31:27.680 --> 31:29.597
to keep the 18 to 34's happy.

31:29.598 --> 31:32.474
- And who's going to shoot it?

31:32.475 --> 31:34.686
You're not doing that as well,
are ya?

31:34.687 --> 31:35.436
- Well, no.

31:35.437 --> 31:37.104
For this, we need a real artist.

31:37.105 --> 31:40.858
You know, because we want it
to be really cinemategrophic.

31:40.859 --> 31:41.694
Cinematog...

31:42.778 --> 31:43.820
- Cinematic!

31:43.821 --> 31:44.946
Cinematic.

31:44.947 --> 31:46.197
- That doesn't sound right,
somehow.

31:46.198 --> 31:47.365
- I'll shoot it.

31:49.159 --> 31:51.619
- I see, and what are your
qualifications?

31:51.620 --> 31:53.454
- None of your fucking business.

31:53.455 --> 31:55.164
- Okay then.

31:55.165 --> 31:56.166
- Well, okay.

31:57.209 --> 31:57.917
I think that's everything
sorted, isn't it?

31:57.918 --> 31:58.918
So, let's just get cracking!

31:58.919 --> 32:01.504
- Now, I'm new to this
filming malarkey.

32:01.505 --> 32:03.590
But, I do think there
are some roles

32:03.591 --> 32:05.132
that you haven't allocated yet.

32:05.133 --> 32:07.176
- Oh for fuck's sake then,
you're sound.

32:07.177 --> 32:09.011
You're, I dunno, transport.

32:09.012 --> 32:10.346
You're stunts.

32:10.347 --> 32:12.098
And you're making all
the biscuits, all right?

32:12.099 --> 32:13.516
- Let's go.
- Let's do it, okay?

32:13.517 --> 32:14.767
- Everyone happy?
- Not that complicated.

32:14.768 --> 32:15.768
- Let's go!
- Fucking hell.

32:15.769 --> 32:16.520
- Excellent.

32:17.437 --> 32:19.647
- We are so sorry.

32:19.648 --> 32:21.941
- Yes, forgive us our slight.

32:21.942 --> 32:26.028
- The others, they made us
commit to such a wretched path.

32:26.029 --> 32:29.156
- How dare you make
a rival blog?

32:29.157 --> 32:31.243
Speak, or we shall end you.

32:32.244 --> 32:34.370
- We are so very sorry.

32:34.371 --> 32:35.623
It was truly folly,

32:36.915 --> 32:39.542
to attempt to match the grandeur
of your online footprint.

32:39.543 --> 32:40.877
We are naught but ants.

32:40.878 --> 32:42.920
And you, like Gods on Olympus.

32:42.921 --> 32:45.422
- Yes, how very correct of you.

32:45.423 --> 32:46.924
- You are banished.

32:46.925 --> 32:49.468
Do not cross our eyes again.

32:49.469 --> 32:53.305
Lest you wish to meet
with the undead's tooth.

32:53.306 --> 32:55.975
- Thank you, thank you.

32:55.976 --> 32:58.978
- We will never darken
your door again.

32:58.979 --> 32:59.813
- Next!

33:04.610 --> 33:05.777
- Great.

33:05.778 --> 33:07.987
- Why would anyone talk
like this?

33:07.988 --> 33:09.488
- Look pal, you weren't there.

33:09.489 --> 33:10.197
And we were.

33:10.198 --> 33:11.574
- Do you not think you're...

33:11.575 --> 33:13.660
You're writing it as you
remember it,

33:13.661 --> 33:15.828
rather than what actually
happened?

33:15.829 --> 33:18.414
- All right friend, how
else would you do it?

33:18.415 --> 33:20.166
- I don't know, realistically.

33:20.167 --> 33:22.919
- (laughs) This is meant
to be escapism, mate.

33:22.920 --> 33:25.004
If you want realism, look
out the fucking window!

33:25.005 --> 33:26.506
(Phil clears throat)

33:26.507 --> 33:27.715
- Oh hiya, you all right.

33:27.716 --> 33:29.216
- Okay, hiya.

33:29.217 --> 33:32.386
So erm, this isn't as big a
part as ours.

33:32.387 --> 33:33.429
But you will be playing Adam,

33:33.430 --> 33:34.681
and he was the fourth housemate.

33:34.682 --> 33:36.098
So you're sort of important,
by default.

33:36.099 --> 33:37.184
- Sure.
- Okay?

33:38.226 --> 33:39.185
- I mean you die
obviously, quite early on.

33:39.186 --> 33:40.102
But you know, that's what
happened, so.

33:40.103 --> 33:42.063
Shall we just go through
the scene,

33:42.064 --> 33:43.064
and see how you get on?

33:43.065 --> 33:43.940
- Sure, yeah.

33:43.941 --> 33:44.607
- Okay, great.

33:44.608 --> 33:45.983
Good, okay.

33:45.984 --> 33:47.903
Well I go first, so...

33:49.071 --> 33:50.863
(Adam deep breathing)

33:50.864 --> 33:52.281
Oh, just having a little...

33:52.282 --> 33:53.324
A little shake.

33:53.325 --> 33:54.366
Okay.

33:54.367 --> 33:55.451
- Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

33:55.452 --> 33:56.954
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

33:58.581 --> 33:59.831
- He's doing the warm up.

33:59.832 --> 34:01.708
Warm up? Warm up!

34:01.709 --> 34:02.625
Vocal, vocal.

34:02.626 --> 34:03.417
- Vocal.
- Vocal?

34:03.418 --> 34:04.293
- Vocal.
- Oh, vocal chords?

34:04.294 --> 34:05.878
Oh right, okay.

34:05.879 --> 34:08.172
(Phil clears throat)

34:08.172 --> 34:10.257
- He's a professional.
- You all right?

34:10.257 --> 34:13.386
(Adam deep breathing)

34:17.474 --> 34:18.350
Okay, so.

34:22.730 --> 34:23.855
- Okay.
- Okay.

34:23.856 --> 34:25.022
- Okay.
- Okay.

34:25.023 --> 34:26.065
Thanks, ready?

34:27.693 --> 34:30.360
Oh Adam, it's horrible!

34:30.362 --> 34:32.864
What's happening?
- The dead.

34:33.616 --> 34:34.491
They live.

34:36.243 --> 34:37.909
- But how can this be?

34:37.911 --> 34:41.581
- Somebody's been playing
with God's cookbook.

34:41.581 --> 34:45.417
And it looks like they've
brought back a recipe.

34:45.418 --> 34:46.128
From hell.

34:47.588 --> 34:48.963
(all murmuring)

34:48.964 --> 34:49.964
- That's pretty good,
really good.

34:49.965 --> 34:50.841
Yeah, wow.

34:52.259 --> 34:53.425
- He isn't finished, yet.

34:53.426 --> 34:54.511
- Oh right okay, sorry.

34:54.512 --> 34:56.513
- Should wait maybe, a bit.

34:56.514 --> 34:58.516
Is he, is he all right?

35:00.267 --> 35:01.183
- And scene!

35:01.184 --> 35:01.851
- Oh wow.
- Whoa!

35:01.852 --> 35:03.145
- Very good!

35:05.022 --> 35:06.273
- Sorry.

35:07.440 --> 35:08.149
- No, that was so good!
- I was just lost in the art!

35:08.150 --> 35:08.983
- I mean like, such sparks.

35:08.984 --> 35:11.819
Like, really vibing.
- Oh, god.

35:11.820 --> 35:13.070
Gosh, can I just?

35:13.071 --> 35:14.405
- It was fantastic.
- Oh, that's great.

35:14.406 --> 35:15.197
- Thank you-
- Thank you very much.

35:15.198 --> 35:16.240
- So much!

35:16.241 --> 35:17.324
- Nice, nice.
- Thank you.

35:17.325 --> 35:18.493
Oh my, oh god!

35:19.662 --> 35:20.495
- Wow.

35:21.580 --> 35:23.247
- Well for me, it's-

35:23.248 --> 35:24.249
- It's the love of film.

35:24.583 --> 35:26.584
- It's the love of
film, audience reaction.

35:26.585 --> 35:29.796
I love to see the audience,
at the end of the film.

35:29.797 --> 35:31.589
Crying, smiling.

35:31.590 --> 35:32.882
Walking out that theater.

35:32.883 --> 35:34.592
Thinking, wow.

35:34.593 --> 35:36.260
- It's, it's-
- We've just seen some magic.

35:36.261 --> 35:38.054
- It's a piece of...

35:38.055 --> 35:40.265
Well it's kind of sharing
humanity, isn't it?

35:40.473 --> 35:41.891
- Don't really know what
I'm supposed to be doing,

35:41.892 --> 35:42.600
at this point.

35:42.601 --> 35:44.268
No one, there's not really...

35:44.269 --> 35:48.440
There doesn't seem to be a
real organization, as such.

35:50.568 --> 35:53.319
It's just, there seem to
be people doing things.

35:53.320 --> 35:55.530
But I think they're just
kind of looking busy,

35:55.531 --> 35:56.657
so that they...

35:57.991 --> 35:58.867
Look busy.

36:00.410 --> 36:03.163
- Yeah, I've never been
in a film.

36:04.372 --> 36:06.999
I mean, I've never thought
about it...

36:07.000 --> 36:08.167
Really.

36:08.168 --> 36:09.085
About watching myself
doing things,

36:09.086 --> 36:11.546
that I've done in the past.

36:11.547 --> 36:14.381
It's like memories, innit.

36:14.382 --> 36:16.050
- [Hannah] But you will not be
in the film

36:16.051 --> 36:18.052
because you're make up.

36:18.053 --> 36:19.095
- Oh yeah.

36:19.096 --> 36:22.014
- Oh yeah, we're doing this now?

36:22.015 --> 36:22.890
We're doing this now?

36:22.891 --> 36:23.559
Fuck.

36:25.185 --> 36:26.268
Er...

36:26.269 --> 36:27.854
Yeah, er...

36:27.855 --> 36:30.064
It's been trying.

36:30.065 --> 36:31.315
You know, you come over.

36:31.316 --> 36:34.443
And you're trying to do, with
all of this that's going on.

36:34.444 --> 36:36.529
All of this craziness.

36:36.530 --> 36:39.031
You're trying to do a proper
job, still.

36:39.032 --> 36:41.075
Still got the training.

36:41.076 --> 36:43.828
Still you know, trying
to get call sheets done.

36:43.829 --> 36:45.580
Trying to make sure people
get to set, on time.

36:45.581 --> 36:46.998
Health and safety.

36:46.999 --> 36:48.457
And they're just, you know.

36:48.458 --> 36:49.917
Everything that they're doing

36:49.918 --> 36:51.168
is just like, detrimental
to that.

36:51.169 --> 36:52.629
It's been a...

36:52.630 --> 36:54.756
They're not here, are they?

36:54.757 --> 36:56.591
- I think this is going
pretty well.

36:56.592 --> 36:58.259
- Yeah.

36:58.260 --> 37:01.263
Shame about that chap
who's playing Ad.

37:02.389 --> 37:04.599
He doesn't last the script,
does he?

37:04.600 --> 37:06.100
- Yeah but that's what happened,
you know.

37:06.101 --> 37:08.561
We gotta adhere to the
historical accuracy.

37:08.562 --> 37:09.729
- He died horribly.

37:09.730 --> 37:11.981
- Adam?
- Yeah, he really did.

37:11.982 --> 37:14.316
- Hi, I heard you were
looking for some biscuits.

37:14.317 --> 37:15.401
So, er.
- Yes!

37:15.402 --> 37:16.653
- I thought I'd bring these over

37:16.654 --> 37:18.362
- Oh, thank you.

37:18.363 --> 37:20.532
- I just had to say, I'm
really excited to be here.

37:20.533 --> 37:22.742
I'm a huge fan of the blog.

37:22.743 --> 37:24.619
- You're a fan of the blog?

37:24.620 --> 37:27.496
- Oh wow, yes it's helped
get me through

37:27.497 --> 37:29.916
some very dark days.

37:29.917 --> 37:30.917
- She's a fan of the blog!

37:30.918 --> 37:32.001
Got her through some dark days!

37:32.002 --> 37:32.960
- Yeah I heard, yeah.

37:32.961 --> 37:34.045
- What about the biscuits?

37:34.046 --> 37:34.838
- Oh, yeah.

37:37.299 --> 37:39.175
- Fucking Jaffa Cakes!

37:39.176 --> 37:41.135
- Oh my god, thank you!

37:41.136 --> 37:41.803
Share them out!

37:41.804 --> 37:43.345
- Don't mention it.

37:43.346 --> 37:45.848
Look anything you need,
you just let me know.

37:45.849 --> 37:47.308
I picked the all or nothing perk

37:47.309 --> 37:49.351
So anything you want, just ask!

37:49.352 --> 37:50.477
- That was you?

37:50.478 --> 37:52.104
- Yeah, I'm Lyndsey.

37:52.105 --> 37:53.815
Lucky donor number seven!

37:53.816 --> 37:54.857
- We didn't think anybody
would be that gullible.

37:54.858 --> 37:55.650
- Er, generous!

37:55.651 --> 37:57.193
Generous, as to pick that perk.

37:57.194 --> 37:59.070
And not expect anything
in return.

37:59.071 --> 38:02.031
- Oh I'm a fan, so just
being here's reward enough.

38:02.032 --> 38:02.699
- A fan!

38:02.700 --> 38:04.241
Oh my god, you're lovely!

38:04.242 --> 38:05.535
I love you!

38:05.536 --> 38:07.538
- Thanks, I love you too.

38:10.248 --> 38:12.709
(Hannah crunching)

38:12.710 --> 38:15.920
Anyway, best go get more
Jaffa Cakes.

38:15.921 --> 38:17.755
- Great.

38:17.756 --> 38:19.966
Oh actually, have you
been assigned a role yet?

38:19.967 --> 38:22.552
- I auditioned this
morning, but I got rejected.

38:22.553 --> 38:25.137
So I think I'm in the
wrangling department,

38:25.138 --> 38:27.306
but I'm not really sure
what that is.

38:27.307 --> 38:30.727
- Yeah, that's zombie control.

38:30.728 --> 38:33.270
Don't worry,
we'll give you a stick.

38:33.271 --> 38:34.606
- Great!

38:34.607 --> 38:36.941
Whatever, I'm totally
fine with that.

38:36.942 --> 38:38.776
I mean, they're amazing!

38:38.777 --> 38:41.863
I mean, how can you not
think they're amazing?

38:41.864 --> 38:44.866
I mean, they're just
literally my idols.

38:44.867 --> 38:47.159
Like, I just hope that
they like me,

38:47.160 --> 38:49.662
as much as I like them.

38:49.663 --> 38:52.540
- Give me your hand,
if you want to live.

38:52.541 --> 38:53.750
Give me your hand if you
want to live?

38:53.751 --> 38:54.876
- Live.

38:54.877 --> 38:56.335
Okay, it's Adam's death scene.

38:56.336 --> 38:57.254
Where's Adam?

38:58.922 --> 39:00.381
No, I don't want any Jaffa Cakes

39:00.382 --> 39:02.216
- Actually no, just stay
here a second.

39:02.217 --> 39:05.177
Actually Miles, I've
recast Lyndsey as Adam.

39:05.178 --> 39:07.388
So, now it's Madam.

39:07.389 --> 39:08.347
- What?

39:08.348 --> 39:09.349
- Yeah, I...

39:11.018 --> 39:12.351
I...

39:12.352 --> 39:13.185
- Oh, yeah.

39:13.186 --> 39:14.187
No sorry, sorry mate.

39:15.397 --> 39:16.105
We've just had a little
bit of a rethink, you know.

39:16.106 --> 39:17.774
And I just think you know,

39:17.775 --> 39:19.692
you'd be great in the
stunt department.

39:19.693 --> 39:20.985
- Tony, hey tony!

39:20.986 --> 39:22.654
We're, erm...

39:22.655 --> 39:24.488
This guy is gonna make us
such a great stunt guy,

39:24.489 --> 39:25.197
don't you think?

39:25.198 --> 39:27.074
With that hair, and the...

39:27.075 --> 39:28.284
- Come with me.

39:28.285 --> 39:30.036
We're gonna have loads of fun.

39:30.037 --> 39:31.037
- Great, you know.

39:31.038 --> 39:32.371
I just, you know.

39:32.372 --> 39:33.330
It's just a bit of a
sausage-fest otherwise,

39:33.331 --> 39:34.374
don't you think?

39:35.626 --> 39:37.544
So I thought in the interests
of diversity, I'd recast Adam.

39:37.545 --> 39:39.253
Cause I thought it'd be good,
you know.

39:39.254 --> 39:41.297
To have a positive female
relationship, in the film.

39:41.298 --> 39:42.632
- Adam was a boy.

39:42.633 --> 39:44.008
- Was he though?

39:44.009 --> 39:45.009
- Let me check my memory bank...

39:45.010 --> 39:46.468
Yes of course he cocking was!

39:46.469 --> 39:48.513
- He could have been
non-binary, we don't know.

39:48.514 --> 39:51.015
- Yeah, I'm pretty fluid
about most things these days.

39:51.016 --> 39:53.726
- Well you were the one's on
about historical accuracy.

39:53.727 --> 39:55.812
- What does it matter?

39:55.813 --> 39:57.021
What's that thing you're
always saying?

39:57.022 --> 39:58.105
Be the change.

39:58.106 --> 39:59.440
Well look, I'm doing it!

39:59.441 --> 40:00.651
I'm being the change!

40:00.943 --> 40:02.151
- I have literally never,
ever said that.

40:02.152 --> 40:03.570
You're always saying that to me.

40:03.571 --> 40:05.237
- Am I?

40:05.238 --> 40:06.322
- I think that, erm-

40:06.323 --> 40:07.865
- Yeah that's so great, yeah.

40:07.866 --> 40:09.867
No, I just think that history's
has far too much dick in it.

40:09.868 --> 40:11.994
It's time for a bit more boob.

40:11.995 --> 40:14.289
- Thanks for that, er, PA?

40:15.583 --> 40:17.166
Take a note, please.

40:17.167 --> 40:19.126
Hannah, I hate you.

40:19.127 --> 40:21.420
And from now, I shall only
be communicating with you

40:21.421 --> 40:23.422
via my emissary.

40:23.423 --> 40:25.007
It's two S's, yeah.

40:25.008 --> 40:26.676
PS, eat a poo.

40:26.677 --> 40:27.511
- What?

40:28.512 --> 40:29.471
Oh, thanks.

40:30.514 --> 40:31.681
What?

40:31.682 --> 40:35.142
- Yeah, I've dabbled in
acting before.

40:35.143 --> 40:36.644
Which has...

40:36.645 --> 40:37.353
Which has been great.

40:37.354 --> 40:39.105
I mean, nothing compared to this

40:39.106 --> 40:41.190
I mean, have you seen how
professional these three are?

40:41.191 --> 40:42.859
It's, er...

40:42.860 --> 40:44.527
I imagine that it is, you know.

40:44.528 --> 40:47.530
World class filming experience.

40:47.531 --> 40:48.740
So, yeah I've done a bit.

40:48.741 --> 40:50.742
But, nothing like this.

40:50.743 --> 40:52.368
- I kinda just got thrown
into it, if I'm honest.

40:52.369 --> 40:53.870
I don't really know
what I'm doing.

40:53.871 --> 40:55.037
But I know what colours are,

40:55.038 --> 40:56.914
and sometimes they
look okay together.

40:56.915 --> 40:58.583
So, I think I'm doing an
all right job.

40:58.584 --> 41:00.251
The directors are...

41:00.252 --> 41:01.086
Fantastic.

41:02.295 --> 41:03.756
They are so...

41:04.882 --> 41:06.215
Organized.

41:06.216 --> 41:08.217
So this is a...

41:08.218 --> 41:09.385
Lovely number.

41:09.386 --> 41:11.554
Which I found on a...

41:11.555 --> 41:13.431
On a woman, who was...

41:14.767 --> 41:15.934
In pieces.

41:17.144 --> 41:17.810
You can't really see the
blood, cause it's nice and red.

41:17.811 --> 41:19.812
This one, I found in a bin.

41:19.813 --> 41:21.773
And this is...

41:21.774 --> 41:23.566
Yellow.

41:23.567 --> 41:26.110
- As long as they do, what
they said they're gonna do.

41:26.111 --> 41:27.820
Which is my vision.

41:27.821 --> 41:31.407
My vision is that, at the end,
there will be so much blood.

41:31.408 --> 41:33.660
There will be so much
death and catastrophe,

41:33.661 --> 41:36.245
that it will be...

41:36.246 --> 41:37.204
Magnificent.

41:37.205 --> 41:38.497
But I don't know...

41:38.498 --> 41:39.999
I don't know how they're
gonna do that.

41:40.000 --> 41:43.003
(zombies banging)

41:45.506 --> 41:49.341
- Namaste, and welcome
to our zombie boot camp.

41:49.342 --> 41:50.760
Today, I'm going to be
teaching you all

41:50.761 --> 41:53.930
how to safely interact with
the zombie.

41:53.931 --> 41:55.347
Because some health and
safety vampires,

41:55.348 --> 41:57.267
insist that I do that.

42:00.437 --> 42:02.522
First, we're gonna do
a few little stretches.

42:02.523 --> 42:04.524
So, as I do.

42:04.525 --> 42:07.986
(upbeat electronic music)

42:15.869 --> 42:17.328
Okay, that's enough stretches.

42:17.329 --> 42:19.288
Right, we're just gonna do
a few zombie drills now.

42:19.289 --> 42:21.290
So, you know.

42:21.291 --> 42:23.459
Just see what happens.

42:23.460 --> 42:26.338
(zombies groaning)

42:27.590 --> 42:28.464
- Be the zombie.

42:28.465 --> 42:29.340
Be the zombie.

42:29.341 --> 42:30.383
Be the zombie.

42:33.178 --> 42:36.223
(zombies groaning)

42:37.432 --> 42:40.310
(Phil screaming)

42:47.651 --> 42:49.902
- Chaos, absolute chaos.

42:49.903 --> 42:51.654
It's like, it's like...

42:51.655 --> 42:54.448
It's like a war zone.

42:54.449 --> 42:57.702
Except, we're all on the
same side.

42:57.703 --> 42:59.871
But I honestly don't
know if I will survive

42:59.872 --> 43:02.289
long enough to see the
finished film.

43:02.290 --> 43:03.791
- [Camera Man] Do you want
to see the finished film?

43:03.792 --> 43:04.917
- Not really.

43:04.918 --> 43:08.338
(eerie orchestral music)

43:13.802 --> 43:15.427
- Do you think they read the
call sheet?

43:15.428 --> 43:17.847
- Of course the didn't
fucking read it.

43:17.848 --> 43:20.017
- God, I hope they're dead.

43:20.976 --> 43:24.353
(Hannah moaning)

43:24.354 --> 43:27.481
- Why are we up this early?

43:27.482 --> 43:30.192
- Because it was your idea.

43:30.193 --> 43:30.861
- Eh?

43:32.530 --> 43:34.405
- Yeah, this whole thing's
your idea!

43:34.406 --> 43:35.406
- Oh, is it?

43:35.407 --> 43:36.324
Oh, okay.

43:37.910 --> 43:38.910
- It's exciting though, innit?

43:38.911 --> 43:40.077
- Yeah.

43:40.078 --> 43:42.204
- Where is everyone?

43:42.205 --> 43:44.082
- Lyndsey's here.
- Oh.

43:45.793 --> 43:47.127
- [Hannah] Hello.

43:51.256 --> 43:54.216
- Oh hello, and what time d'ya
call this?

43:54.217 --> 43:55.552
- What time do we?

43:55.553 --> 43:57.094
Where the hell have you been!

43:57.095 --> 44:00.222
We got into so much grief,
it was a blood bath!

44:00.223 --> 44:01.934
Brian died in my arms.

44:03.476 --> 44:04.894
- Brian's gone, too?

44:04.895 --> 44:07.647
- His head fell off. (sobs)

44:07.648 --> 44:09.315
- Who's Brian?

44:09.316 --> 44:12.443
- You'd know, if you read
the fucking call sheet!

44:12.444 --> 44:14.445
- What's a call sheet?

44:14.446 --> 44:16.488
- We lost three people,
getting here.

44:16.489 --> 44:17.489
If you'd have been with us.

44:17.490 --> 44:19.033
And if you'd have issued
the supplies

44:19.034 --> 44:20.660
we've been risking our
lives for,

44:20.661 --> 44:22.411
they would still be here!

44:22.412 --> 44:24.831
- (laughs) Wow!

44:24.832 --> 44:26.708
Wow, this guy is so intense.

44:26.709 --> 44:28.167
We should get this guy
in the movie.

44:28.168 --> 44:29.419
- Oh, yeah.
- We should.

44:30.504 --> 44:31.087
Right everybody,
let's get into position!

44:31.088 --> 44:33.214
- Wait, what we doing?

44:33.215 --> 44:34.424
What's happening?

44:35.593 --> 44:36.342
- Dunno what we're doing,
that's so unprofessional.

44:36.343 --> 44:38.010
What are we, what are we doing?

44:38.011 --> 44:39.386
- What, really?
- Yeah, what we doing.

44:39.387 --> 44:40.722
- [Miles] Well, I thought
we were gonna do...

44:40.723 --> 44:43.224
Adam, Madam's death scene.

44:43.225 --> 44:44.101
- Okay, yeah.

44:44.518 --> 44:45.602
- Wait, why are we doing
that first?

44:45.603 --> 44:48.563
Like, can't we do it in
order, like real life?

44:48.564 --> 44:49.897
- That...

44:49.898 --> 44:51.774
Is not really...

44:51.775 --> 44:52.860
How film works.

44:54.194 --> 44:56.195
- But, why not?

44:56.196 --> 44:58.239
- Lots of reasons!

44:58.240 --> 44:59.866
Actors aren't always available.

44:59.867 --> 45:01.492
Some of the set and
stuff, isn't ready yet.

45:01.493 --> 45:02.994
The Minster burned down.

45:02.995 --> 45:04.453
And so you asked us to
rebuild it,

45:04.454 --> 45:07.248
so you can film your big
day Zee, or is it Zed day?

45:07.249 --> 45:08.583
Or is it Zay day, because
then it rhymes-

45:08.584 --> 45:09.626
- [All] Z day.

45:09.627 --> 45:11.919
(all chattering)

45:11.920 --> 45:13.631
- It doesn't matter!

45:17.134 --> 45:19.678
- Right, can I just get that?

45:20.888 --> 45:23.472
- Okay, so the Adam death scene.

45:23.473 --> 45:25.892
Do we have shot list for that?

45:25.893 --> 45:27.351
- What's a shot list?

45:27.352 --> 45:29.186
- Never mind, just walk me
through it.

45:29.187 --> 45:30.438
- Okay, so erm...

45:32.525 --> 45:33.775
Right, well we're running
away from the zombies, okay?

45:33.776 --> 45:35.026
So, it's Day Z.

45:35.027 --> 45:35.985
We've found out what's happening

45:35.986 --> 45:38.154
Everybody's a zombie, it's awful

45:38.155 --> 45:40.657
So we're running home,
and then Adam gets...

45:40.658 --> 45:43.284
Sorry, Madam gets attacked
by zombies.

45:43.285 --> 45:46.913
And then we're forced to
leave her, to survive.

45:46.914 --> 45:48.414
And then we sort of, we run off.

45:48.415 --> 45:50.708
There's screaming,
it's pretty awful.

45:50.709 --> 45:53.419
Do you think you could
get all that in one shot?

45:53.420 --> 45:54.462
Yeah, great.
- Yeah.

45:55.714 --> 45:56.964
Might be quite stimulating
to attempt that, actually.

45:56.965 --> 46:00.510
You know, exemplify that
there really is no escaping

46:00.511 --> 46:01.511
from the apocalypse.

46:01.512 --> 46:02.345
- That's great, okay brilliant.

46:02.680 --> 46:04.847
I'll leave that with you,
thank you.

46:04.848 --> 46:06.307
- Coming in.

46:06.308 --> 46:07.684
Lots of blood, and stuff.

46:07.685 --> 46:09.101
And then...

46:09.102 --> 46:10.145
Yup, got it.

46:12.606 --> 46:14.315
- I've been having some thoughts

46:14.316 --> 46:15.025
- Okay.

46:17.194 --> 46:19.696
It must have been hard,
leaving Adam.

46:19.697 --> 46:21.198
- Adam, Adam...

46:22.074 --> 46:23.407
Oh yeah, no.

46:23.408 --> 46:24.992
Yeah, no it really was, yeah.

46:24.993 --> 46:25.994
It was very difficult.

46:26.912 --> 46:27.870
- I'm sure you did everything
you could.

46:27.871 --> 46:29.413
- Erm, yeah?

46:29.414 --> 46:31.290
But I mean, we definitely
will have done

46:31.291 --> 46:32.291
everything we could do, I think.

46:32.292 --> 46:33.376
- Did we though?

46:34.587 --> 46:36.087
I think actually, we ran away
cause we were scared shitless.

46:36.088 --> 46:38.130
- You remember it one way.

46:38.131 --> 46:39.591
You know, I'm just having
second thoughts

46:39.592 --> 46:40.759
about this death scene.

46:41.760 --> 46:42.426
- Oh god, what second
thoughts are you having

46:42.427 --> 46:42.928
about this death scene?

46:44.054 --> 46:45.262
- I just feel like, it
sends the wrong message.

46:45.263 --> 46:46.306
To have the first day

46:47.390 --> 46:48.099
involve the killing of
a female character.

46:48.100 --> 46:48.976
You agree?

46:50.102 --> 46:51.268
- Adam wasn't female.

46:51.269 --> 46:53.062
- Yeah, but they are now.

46:53.063 --> 46:54.438
I just think it's not
right to fridge Madam,

46:54.439 --> 46:55.815
to give us the motivation

46:55.816 --> 46:57.441
to spend the next six
months indoors.

46:57.442 --> 46:58.943
- But, it's what happened.

46:58.944 --> 47:01.112
Secondly, it's not the start
of the movie.

47:01.113 --> 47:02.113
So, we're not beginning
the movie with it.

47:02.114 --> 47:03.656
And third, who cares?

47:03.657 --> 47:05.992
There's millions of deaths
in this movie.

47:05.993 --> 47:07.326
- Well, I just don't think
only one who has to die,

47:07.327 --> 47:08.327
should be female.

47:08.328 --> 47:09.078
- Oh, bugger this.

47:09.079 --> 47:11.081
Ridiculous, ridiculous.

47:15.210 --> 47:17.086
- Er excuse me, can I just?

47:17.087 --> 47:18.170
Can I, thanks.

47:18.171 --> 47:18.838
You'll just have to...

47:18.839 --> 47:19.839
Thanks very much, cheers.

47:19.840 --> 47:21.257
Hiya, so...

47:21.258 --> 47:22.258
We've...

47:22.259 --> 47:23.343
We've rethought.

47:24.386 --> 47:24.928
We've rethought the scene
now, and you survive.

47:25.846 --> 47:26.179
- Okay.
- So what we're gonna do,

47:27.347 --> 47:28.014
is we're gonna have some
zombie attack you, right?

47:28.015 --> 47:30.517
But then you escape, okay?

47:30.518 --> 47:31.183
- Okay.

47:31.184 --> 47:32.018
- That all seem fine, yeah?

47:32.019 --> 47:33.936
So if they do attack you,

47:33.937 --> 47:36.230
it's probably gonna be a
stunt zombie, so don't worry.

47:36.231 --> 47:39.984
If not, then Tony will
get them, hopefully, okay?

47:39.985 --> 47:41.193
- Okay.
- Great.

47:41.194 --> 47:42.862
So, is that all fine?

47:42.863 --> 47:44.155
- Yeah sure, yeah.

47:44.156 --> 47:45.114
Happy to be here.

47:45.115 --> 47:45.990
- Me too!

47:45.991 --> 47:47.449
Great, good.

47:47.450 --> 47:49.410
Well, come on everyone.

47:49.411 --> 47:50.494
Let's get started!

47:50.495 --> 47:51.538
- We're not ready!

47:51.539 --> 47:53.581
- Great, roll camera!

47:53.582 --> 47:57.419
(dramatic orchestral music)

48:20.108 --> 48:23.110
- Man, these zombies are a
real menace.

48:23.111 --> 48:25.863
I wonder how long we are
going to have them for?

48:25.864 --> 48:27.740
- Yes, this sort of thing

48:27.741 --> 48:30.159
can really put a ding
in your social calendar.

48:30.160 --> 48:31.202
Right, Adam?

48:31.203 --> 48:32.662
Madam, whatever.

48:32.663 --> 48:33.539
- Yes.

48:35.165 --> 48:38.500
- What do you think is
the cause of this blight?

48:38.501 --> 48:39.544
- It's you.

48:39.545 --> 48:41.213
- Oh erm, bad gout.

48:42.506 --> 48:43.840
- Gout, what like gout?

48:43.841 --> 48:45.174
Like from...

48:45.175 --> 48:48.344
Well, that solves that
mystery then.

48:48.345 --> 48:49.261
- It's you.

48:49.262 --> 48:50.471
- Oh, erm...

48:50.472 --> 48:51.348
Yes.

48:52.474 --> 48:55.267
- Hark, a wild zombie approaches

48:55.268 --> 48:58.021
(Lyndsey gasping)

49:11.076 --> 49:12.076
- Okay, right.

49:12.077 --> 49:13.369
What we're gonna do now,

49:13.370 --> 49:15.037
is we're gonna heard
some zombies over

49:15.038 --> 49:16.581
from over there, okay?

49:16.582 --> 49:19.083
And then, instead of Madam
getting bitten.

49:19.084 --> 49:20.376
What we're actually gonna do,

49:20.377 --> 49:21.253
is we're gonna escape.

49:21.587 --> 49:22.712
And then we're gonna have
some crisps.

49:22.713 --> 49:24.255
All right, that's the new plan.

49:24.256 --> 49:26.423
- How are we gonna do that?

49:26.424 --> 49:27.550
- Well, you just open the bag.

49:27.551 --> 49:28.259
And then you just...

49:28.260 --> 49:29.761
- Not crisps, the zombies!

49:29.762 --> 49:30.970
How are we gonna stay alive?

49:30.971 --> 49:32.555
- They're fucking...

49:32.556 --> 49:33.931
- It's fine, Tony's got a plan.

49:33.932 --> 49:35.767
- No he doesn't!

49:35.768 --> 49:37.226
- Ah chill man, this is
what you live for right?

49:37.227 --> 49:38.770
- This is not safe, Tony.
- It's cool, man.

49:38.771 --> 49:39.478
- This is not safe!
- It's totally cool.

49:39.479 --> 49:40.980
We're gonna get a stunty in.

49:40.981 --> 49:43.650
Hey stunty, come over here!

49:43.651 --> 49:45.109
Ah come on man, put a bit
more spring in your step,

49:45.110 --> 49:46.569
this is film making!

49:46.570 --> 49:48.780
Right so, I'm gonna go over
there,

49:48.781 --> 49:50.239
lure those lurkers over here.

49:50.240 --> 49:51.490
You're gonna get yourself
in make up

49:51.491 --> 49:52.659
then when we start shooting,

49:52.660 --> 49:54.160
you're gonna have a mingle
with them.

49:54.161 --> 49:56.037
And then we get real close
in the shot,

49:56.038 --> 49:59.373
you jump out, we kill
you, that's the scene.

49:59.374 --> 50:00.834
- Kill me.
- Yeah.

50:02.085 --> 50:03.545
- Shall we rehearse this?

50:03.546 --> 50:05.212
- Nah man, we'll feel it out.

50:05.213 --> 50:06.256
- Erm, okay.

50:07.675 --> 50:09.175
Do you have any safe weapons?

50:09.176 --> 50:11.511
- (laughs) Great, great.

50:11.512 --> 50:12.680
- No, no, no.

50:14.848 --> 50:16.683
How are we gonna do this?

50:16.684 --> 50:19.185
- Well, I'm gonna throw
this at your head.

50:19.186 --> 50:22.063
You're gonna catch it,
pretend like it got you.

50:22.064 --> 50:24.982
And that's it, jobs a goodun.

50:24.983 --> 50:26.108
- Yeah, I really don't think-

50:26.109 --> 50:29.028
- Okay, we're ready over
here guys!

50:29.029 --> 50:30.113
Come on.

50:31.364 --> 50:32.364
Go on, get your best sides
towards the camera, right?

50:32.365 --> 50:33.866
Okay yeah, you're good,
you're good.

50:33.867 --> 50:35.451
Okay, right.

50:35.452 --> 50:37.912
Ones at the back, a bit
quicker, a bit quicker.

50:37.913 --> 50:38.747
Right okay, that's it.

50:39.122 --> 50:40.540
Group you all up,
group you all up.

50:40.541 --> 50:42.208
Brilliant, brilliant.

50:42.209 --> 50:43.918
Right, you guys ready
to roll yet?

50:43.919 --> 50:44.962
Bloody hell.

50:47.297 --> 50:50.092
(John mumbling)

50:51.176 --> 50:52.885
- Done?
- Mm.

50:52.886 --> 50:54.221
- Do I look dead?

50:55.388 --> 50:56.514
- Mm.

50:56.515 --> 50:58.140
- They're not gonna know?
- Mm.

50:58.141 --> 50:59.517
- You're sure?
- Mm.

50:59.518 --> 51:00.476
- Okay.

51:00.477 --> 51:02.436
- Okay, now this is it.

51:02.437 --> 51:03.605
- But why, Hannah?

51:03.606 --> 51:04.897
- Just let them come towards you

51:04.898 --> 51:06.733
- No, no, no, no.

51:06.734 --> 51:09.151
- Just let them come
towards you, it's fine.

51:09.152 --> 51:10.194
Okay.

51:10.195 --> 51:12.404
(zombies groaning)

51:12.405 --> 51:13.489
All right.
- You're mean.

51:13.490 --> 51:14.448
- Great.

51:14.449 --> 51:18.119
(zombies groaning)

51:18.120 --> 51:18.828
- [Hannah] No, no, no, no.

51:18.829 --> 51:19.704
Because it's good for the film.

51:19.705 --> 51:20.913
- Living the dream.

51:20.914 --> 51:22.206
This is what you want.
- Hold.

51:22.207 --> 51:23.207
You've got friends, now.

51:23.208 --> 51:26.043
You've got friends.

51:26.044 --> 51:27.128
- Okay Tom, can you just...

51:27.129 --> 51:28.755
Can you just like, get yourself

51:28.756 --> 51:30.673
I can't quite see you, there.
- Well done, really good.

51:30.674 --> 51:31.674
- Just make a hole, mate!

51:31.675 --> 51:32.842
Come on!

51:32.843 --> 51:36.513
(zombies groaning)

51:36.514 --> 51:38.515
- Come over here, come over here

51:38.516 --> 51:39.516
Right, right, right there,
right there.

51:39.517 --> 51:40.642
Okay, just stay right there.

51:40.643 --> 51:42.184
Right there.

51:42.185 --> 51:44.311
No, hands down, Jesus!
- No!

51:44.312 --> 51:45.772
- You'll spoil the shot,
hands fucking down!

51:45.773 --> 51:47.524
- No.
- Down, down.

51:47.525 --> 51:48.190
Hands down.

51:48.191 --> 51:49.483
Right okay, here it comes.

51:49.484 --> 51:50.359
Right, this is it.

51:50.360 --> 51:52.194
It's coming, it's coming now!

51:52.195 --> 51:55.032
(blood spurting)

51:57.409 --> 51:59.077
Hannah made me do it.

52:02.247 --> 52:03.165
- Medic!

52:05.417 --> 52:06.251
Oh, shit!

52:07.545 --> 52:09.754
- Cut, great take.

52:09.755 --> 52:11.422
Right, I think we can move on.

52:11.423 --> 52:12.089
Great day, everyone.

52:12.090 --> 52:13.633
Great first day!

52:13.634 --> 52:15.092
- What, that's the scene?

52:15.093 --> 52:16.928
You don't want to make
more coverage?

52:16.929 --> 52:18.638
- I mean, I know
what's-his-name's just died,

52:18.639 --> 52:20.723
but I'd really like
another take, if we can.

52:20.724 --> 52:22.141
- I think we've covered it.

52:22.142 --> 52:23.601
- Someone just died
for that take,

52:23.602 --> 52:25.978
the least we can do is make it
worth it!

52:25.979 --> 52:28.773
- Well why do you think
we're making the film, silly.

52:28.774 --> 52:30.441
See ya tomorrow.

52:30.442 --> 52:33.278
(Hannah whistling)

52:35.280 --> 52:36.448
- We're fucked!

52:37.866 --> 52:40.076
- Of course it's going to be
a success.

52:40.077 --> 52:41.161
I mean, you know.

52:41.662 --> 52:43.370
Whatever the script is,
whatever the actors are.

52:43.371 --> 52:45.915
Whatever I get to work
with, I can turn it around

52:45.916 --> 52:49.210
and make it something quite
magnificent.

52:49.211 --> 52:50.753
- There's a fucking dance
sequence!

52:50.754 --> 52:52.046
A dance sequence!

52:52.047 --> 52:53.756
Why am I saying dance?

52:53.757 --> 52:56.342
I don't like dancing,
it's unsafe.

52:56.343 --> 52:59.887
It's dangerous, there's a
potential to fall, trip,

52:59.888 --> 53:02.432
smash things, get in the way.

53:03.100 --> 53:04.266
Meet people.

53:04.267 --> 53:08.229

53:08.230 --> 53:10.022
♪ What a spooky time ♪

53:10.023 --> 53:11.941
♪ At the end of the world ♪

53:11.942 --> 53:16.112

(zombies groaning)

53:45.601 --> 53:47.101
- What a bunch of fucking idiots

53:47.102 --> 53:49.729
- Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

53:49.730 --> 53:50.772
Ah, ha, ha!

53:50.773 --> 53:51.774
How has it been?

53:52.900 --> 53:54.734
Oh no, it's been an
absolute fucking nightmare!

53:54.735 --> 53:55.442
Are you kidding me?

53:55.443 --> 53:57.570
There's 360 pages of script.

53:57.571 --> 53:59.488
We're doing one shot of
everything.

53:59.489 --> 54:01.157
One shot, one shot.

54:01.158 --> 54:02.700
And then, we go to one day.

54:02.701 --> 54:04.368
And somebody has an ear.

54:04.369 --> 54:05.452
And then the next day,
they don't have an ear.

54:05.453 --> 54:06.370
There's no ear.

54:06.371 --> 54:07.038
It's been bitten off.

54:07.039 --> 54:07.956
And then Tony has a beard.

54:08.456 --> 54:09.499
Oh no wait, he doesn't have
a beard.

54:10.751 --> 54:11.793
He shaved it off, just cause
you know, his face was hot.

54:11.794 --> 54:12.835
His chin was too warm,
so he got rid of it.

54:12.836 --> 54:14.921
And then the next day,
oh what shall we do?

54:14.922 --> 54:16.881
Oh I know, Tony just draws it on

54:16.882 --> 54:18.090
With a Sharpie.

54:18.091 --> 54:19.175
So you know, it's going great.

54:19.176 --> 54:20.260
It's going great.

54:21.428 --> 54:22.178
This is the best thing I've
ever done with my life.

54:22.179 --> 54:23.470
Thank you, thank you for asking.

54:23.471 --> 54:26.140
- Okay guys, it's the big day.

54:26.141 --> 54:27.517
It's time for "Meat Legs".

54:27.518 --> 54:29.811
Now, I know we're all
pretty psyched about this.

54:29.812 --> 54:31.854
I know I'm super stoked.

54:31.855 --> 54:34.356
So what's going to be
happening for the uninitiated,

54:34.357 --> 54:36.984
is that we'll be strapping
some meat to our legs.

54:36.985 --> 54:38.820
We're gonna barrel into
the woods.

54:38.821 --> 54:39.987
And we're gonna fuck with
some zombies.

54:39.988 --> 54:40.823
The end.

54:42.533 --> 54:44.325
Yeah, yeah?

54:44.326 --> 54:45.410
Pretty psyched.

54:46.537 --> 54:48.037
So yeah, you guys wanna
get yourself taped up?

54:48.038 --> 54:49.246
- No.
- Lyndsey go on...

54:49.247 --> 54:50.081
It'll be fun!
- Okay.

54:50.082 --> 54:51.040
- Yeah, you do it.

54:51.041 --> 54:51.916
- Cool.
- Yeah, I'm not doing it.

54:51.917 --> 54:52.709
No, no.
- Oh, you're not?

54:52.710 --> 54:53.585
- No, no way.

54:53.586 --> 54:54.628
No chance in hell.

54:56.880 --> 54:57.547
Being brave Lyndsey,
you get the pokey stick,

54:57.548 --> 54:59.757
to fend some zombies off.

54:59.758 --> 55:01.300
Largely useless, but it's,
you know.

55:01.301 --> 55:03.094
Good psychological body armor.

55:03.095 --> 55:05.096
(laughs) Okay, let's do this.

55:05.097 --> 55:06.765
- [Hannah] All right.

55:12.646 --> 55:15.774
(upbeat rock music)

55:30.497 --> 55:32.498
(zombies groaning)

55:32.499 --> 55:35.586
(upbeat rock music)

55:43.594 --> 55:46.722
(footsteps crunching)

55:52.227 --> 55:53.520
- And then...

55:53.521 --> 55:54.270
- Well then, the head turn-
- Is it look, and do that?

55:54.271 --> 55:54.771
- The head turn-
- Or is, it?

55:54.772 --> 55:56.272
No you turn...

55:56.273 --> 55:58.775
(zombies groaning)

55:58.776 --> 56:02.403
(upbeat rock music)

56:02.404 --> 56:05.240
(zombies grunting)

56:07.535 --> 56:10.495
(crossbow clicking)

56:15.751 --> 56:16.918
- Great, did you see this?

56:16.919 --> 56:17.795
I did see it.

56:20.297 --> 56:21.380
- Oo.

56:21.381 --> 56:22.174
Did we win?

56:23.341 --> 56:24.258
Ah, good.

56:24.259 --> 56:25.467
(Lyndsey screaming)

56:25.468 --> 56:28.263
(zombie chomping)

56:30.098 --> 56:33.143
(blood spattering)

56:34.186 --> 56:35.603
- There, there.

56:35.604 --> 56:39.023
- Oo, maybe be should just
chop it off?

56:39.024 --> 56:39.899
We'll just chop it off.

56:39.900 --> 56:40.567
- What, no, no, no.

56:40.568 --> 56:41.609
It's fine, it's fine.

56:41.610 --> 56:43.152
I'll just, I'll muscle through.

56:43.153 --> 56:44.154
- But, it's...

56:45.155 --> 56:45.697
It's a bit of a nightmare
down there.

56:45.698 --> 56:46.322
- No, no, no, no, no.

56:46.323 --> 56:47.658
No, no, no, it's fine.

56:48.742 --> 56:49.491
I'll make it through to
the end of the shoot,

56:49.492 --> 56:50.201
and then you can, you know, chop

56:50.202 --> 56:52.912
You can just chop it, then.

56:52.913 --> 56:54.789
- This fucking girl!

56:54.790 --> 56:56.040
I love you!

56:56.041 --> 56:57.917
- I love you. (retches)

56:57.918 --> 56:59.627
Oh god.

56:59.628 --> 57:00.295
Okay.

57:01.338 --> 57:02.214
Oh, no.

57:04.132 --> 57:06.342
- The pater was in the forces.

57:06.343 --> 57:08.302
And he said sort of,
similar sort of things,

57:08.303 --> 57:11.347
when people were dropping
down like flies.

57:11.348 --> 57:13.015
It sort of knitted people
together.

57:13.016 --> 57:14.642
So I think we're having

57:14.643 --> 57:16.519
something of a similar
sort of thing,

57:16.520 --> 57:18.187
which is all to the...

57:18.188 --> 57:19.772
All to the good, I feel.

57:19.773 --> 57:21.858
- I don't think any of us
are gonna be surviving,

57:21.859 --> 57:23.943
apart from Tony, Miles
and Hannah.

57:23.944 --> 57:27.489
But I think that's all
part of Tony's plan.

57:29.366 --> 57:31.034
- Alas, poor Romeo.

57:32.077 --> 57:35.913
The time has come, to
launch a nuclear missile...

57:35.914 --> 57:37.874
At the zombie queen.

57:37.875 --> 57:41.712
(melancholy orchestral music)

57:42.755 --> 57:43.631
- Okay, cut!

57:45.132 --> 57:46.924
- What, what am I doing wrong?

57:46.925 --> 57:48.134
- It's not so much that
you're doing it wrong.

57:48.135 --> 57:50.469
It's just that there's a certain

57:50.470 --> 57:53.097
Americanism to your
pronunciation.

57:53.098 --> 57:54.599
- I suppose it's my upbringing,
innit.

57:54.600 --> 57:56.601
- Yes, possibly.

57:56.602 --> 57:57.894
I tell you what, let's
try something.

57:57.895 --> 57:59.478
Say missile.

57:59.479 --> 58:00.647
- Mizzle.

58:00.648 --> 58:01.814
- Missile.

58:01.815 --> 58:02.940
- MissAISLE.

58:02.941 --> 58:04.609
- No, like I said it.

58:04.610 --> 58:05.777
MissILE.

58:05.778 --> 58:07.612
- MissAISLE.

58:07.613 --> 58:08.738
- Okay, there's something
in here

58:08.739 --> 58:09.947
you're obviously not getting.

58:09.948 --> 58:11.365
Let's try,
let's try another word.

58:11.366 --> 58:12.867
Mobile.

58:12.868 --> 58:13.576
- Mobule.

58:13.577 --> 58:14.577
- Mobile.

58:14.578 --> 58:15.703
- MoBAIYLE.

58:15.704 --> 58:16.704
- MobILE.

58:16.705 --> 58:17.664
- MobAIYLE.

58:17.665 --> 58:19.081
- You're trying too hard!

58:19.082 --> 58:19.832
- I'm not trying, at all.

58:19.833 --> 58:21.333
- Try harder, not to try.

58:21.334 --> 58:22.376
- This is really trying.

58:22.377 --> 58:23.085
- You're really trying.

58:23.086 --> 58:25.922
- This is really upsetting.

58:25.923 --> 58:28.007
- Cut it, cut it.

58:28.008 --> 58:30.678
- I don't wanna do this, anymore

58:33.346 --> 58:35.347
- You sure you're all right?

58:35.348 --> 58:39.018
- Yeah, I just don't
wanna lay a zombie egg.

58:39.019 --> 58:40.227
- Oh, you're gonna be fine.

58:40.228 --> 58:42.522
(Lyndsey retching)

58:42.523 --> 58:44.065
Oh, fucking hell.

58:44.066 --> 58:47.194
(footsteps tapping)

58:55.703 --> 58:56.828
- Lyndsey?

58:56.829 --> 58:58.245
(Lyndsey groaning)

58:58.246 --> 58:59.330
(Peter Screaming)

58:59.331 --> 59:00.541
- I mean I think really,

59:01.709 --> 59:03.042
you've got to look at this
holistically, you know?

59:03.043 --> 59:04.335
We're in the middle of a project

59:04.336 --> 59:06.796
and overall it's going very well

59:06.797 --> 59:10.258
(gentle guitar music)

59:22.270 --> 59:23.980
- See it's just through
here, with the ambulance.

59:23.981 --> 59:26.190
And then-
- Oh, this is a good location!

59:26.191 --> 59:29.611
- So, we're a touch concerned
about the production.

59:29.612 --> 59:31.278
- Concerned, why?

59:31.279 --> 59:32.822
I think it's going really well.

59:32.823 --> 59:35.575
- I think the crew might
have a different perspective.

59:35.576 --> 59:36.951
- Yeah well, they may.

59:36.952 --> 59:38.578
But we don't care,
we're the directors.

59:38.579 --> 59:39.245
- Yeah.

59:39.246 --> 59:40.497
- So.
- Exactly.

59:41.624 --> 59:42.790
- Yes well, we took the
platinum producer credit.

59:42.791 --> 59:44.917
Which stated explicitly,

59:44.918 --> 59:49.005
that we would have a hand in
the production of the film.

59:49.006 --> 59:51.674
But so far, all we've had
our hands in,

59:51.675 --> 59:54.343
is the guts of our crew.

59:54.344 --> 59:55.427
- (laughs) Very good.

59:55.428 --> 59:58.515
But it's an honorary
title, so Exec Producer.

59:58.516 --> 01:00:00.016
Stand around on set,
with your arms folded.

01:00:00.017 --> 01:00:01.475
So, well done.
- Perfect.

01:00:01.476 --> 01:00:04.103
- It's a lot more complicated
than that.

01:00:04.104 --> 01:00:06.188
- It's fine, we know
exactly what we're doing.

01:00:06.189 --> 01:00:08.024
This is all part of the plan.

01:00:08.025 --> 01:00:11.027
- So getting your crew
eaten by the local wildlife,

01:00:11.028 --> 01:00:12.361
is part of the plan?

01:00:12.362 --> 01:00:14.155
- Well actually, that
wasn't part of the plan.

01:00:14.156 --> 01:00:16.198
But I think it adds an element
of realism to the film,

01:00:16.199 --> 01:00:17.241
that's quite compelling.

01:00:17.242 --> 01:00:18.242
- It's compelling, it is!

01:00:18.243 --> 01:00:18.910
- It's, it's...
- Compelling.

01:00:18.911 --> 01:00:20.036
- What they would have wanted.

01:00:20.037 --> 01:00:20.912
- Yeah.

01:00:20.913 --> 01:00:21.913
- And the film looks great!

01:00:21.914 --> 01:00:23.540
- About that.

01:00:23.541 --> 01:00:25.082
When can we see the rushes?

01:00:25.083 --> 01:00:26.876
- All right, we're getting
a move on, we're rushing.

01:00:26.877 --> 01:00:30.421
- The footage, when can
we see it?

01:00:30.422 --> 01:00:32.464
- At the premier?
- No, no.

01:00:32.465 --> 01:00:33.926
Not good enough.

01:00:35.135 --> 01:00:37.762
We want to know that our
investment is being paid off.

01:00:37.763 --> 01:00:38.721
- Investment...
- Investment...

01:00:38.722 --> 01:00:39.430
- Oh, they gave us stuff.

01:00:39.431 --> 01:00:40.807
What did you give us, again?

01:00:40.808 --> 01:00:43.434
- 2.5 tons of toilet roll.

01:00:43.435 --> 01:00:45.061
Gold leaf, with aloe vera.

01:00:45.062 --> 01:00:46.271
Soft touch.

01:00:47.314 --> 01:00:48.272
- No actually, that has
been a god send.

01:00:48.273 --> 01:00:49.148
Cause we've been using
doc leaves.

01:00:49.149 --> 01:00:50.900
Books at the library!
- Books, yeah.

01:00:50.901 --> 01:00:51.943
- Just so many of them.

01:00:51.944 --> 01:00:52.902
All that ink, on everywhere.
- Ow!

01:00:52.903 --> 01:00:53.611
Yeah.

01:00:53.612 --> 01:00:56.155
- One of the benefits of IBS.

01:00:56.156 --> 01:00:59.325
I'm always prepared for
an errant bowel movement.

01:00:59.326 --> 01:01:00.159
- Nice.
- Lovely.

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.327
Shall we get back on set?

01:01:01.328 --> 01:01:02.704
Cause we've got magic to create.

01:01:02.705 --> 01:01:04.664
And you have to do some
looming as usual,

01:01:04.665 --> 01:01:05.832
I imagine.
- No, no, no.

01:01:05.833 --> 01:01:09.752
I think we have seen more
than enough of your set.

01:01:09.753 --> 01:01:14.174
Just do not fuck it up, or
there will be consequences.

01:01:15.843 --> 01:01:18.010
- Could you be a bit more
specific about consequences?

01:01:18.011 --> 01:01:19.178
Cause at this stage, you know.

01:01:19.179 --> 01:01:20.221
We've been through quite a lot,

01:01:20.222 --> 01:01:21.931
so that's a bit vague for us.

01:01:21.932 --> 01:01:24.058
- Just try and get though
the day,

01:01:24.059 --> 01:01:26.393
with an actual usable scene.

01:01:26.394 --> 01:01:28.688
Without killing anyone.

01:01:28.689 --> 01:01:29.689
- We'll try...

01:01:29.690 --> 01:01:30.607
To get one of those.
- We'll try.

01:01:30.608 --> 01:01:31.692
- Yeah, try one of those.

01:01:32.693 --> 01:01:33.317
- You can only promise so much,
can't you?

01:01:33.318 --> 01:01:34.068
- Half of one of those.

01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:36.529
Which is what, seven and a half?

01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:37.572
- Seven and a half.
- Seven and a half.

01:01:37.573 --> 01:01:38.656
I think it's good to
promise people things,

01:01:38.657 --> 01:01:39.949
because you know-
- And then not deliver them.

01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:41.075
- It builds trust.

01:01:41.076 --> 01:01:43.077
- They are gonna be a problem.

01:01:43.078 --> 01:01:44.411
- Don't worry.

01:01:44.412 --> 01:01:47.456
I have a plan to deal with them.

01:01:47.457 --> 01:01:50.753
(both manic laughing)

01:01:52.796 --> 01:01:53.506
- (bowel sounds) Oo.
- Oo.

01:02:04.349 --> 01:02:07.519
- So here we are on the set,
as it were.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:10.229
We've sort of stumbled
across this abandoned,

01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:12.398
Halloween theme park, or whateve

01:02:12.399 --> 01:02:15.234
There's like, limbs hanging
from doorways and...

01:02:15.235 --> 01:02:16.861
I think, I think they're
pretend limbs.

01:02:16.862 --> 01:02:19.864
This is Pete, who I hired
to replace Pete the medic.

01:02:19.865 --> 01:02:21.533
I think Pete's better
at his job, this Pete.

01:02:21.534 --> 01:02:24.744
Cause he's got a really big gun.

01:02:24.745 --> 01:02:26.705
What the fuck is this!

01:02:27.873 --> 01:02:29.498
- It's the set you asked for.

01:02:29.499 --> 01:02:31.083
- Yeah, I know what I asked for.

01:02:31.084 --> 01:02:34.086
Which I'm asking,
what the fuck is this?

01:02:34.087 --> 01:02:37.507
- You gave her two weeks
to build the Minster.

01:02:37.508 --> 01:02:38.966
- That's perfectly enough time.

01:02:38.967 --> 01:02:41.302
- It took hundred of years
to build the original,

01:02:41.303 --> 01:02:42.679
you arsehole!

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:44.764
- Duh, they did it by hand in
those days.

01:02:44.765 --> 01:02:47.099
We've got 3D printers
now, this is so shit!

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:49.185
I wanna, I wanna be sick on it.

01:02:49.186 --> 01:02:51.979
(Miles retching)

01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:53.105
I thought you were good at this.

01:02:53.106 --> 01:02:54.941
- No, you put me in the role.

01:02:54.942 --> 01:02:56.025
- Yeah, you volunteered.

01:02:56.026 --> 01:02:57.193
- I didn't.

01:02:57.194 --> 01:02:57.860
- Well, I don't care.

01:02:57.861 --> 01:02:59.361
Just make it work, all right?

01:02:59.362 --> 01:03:00.822
- You...

01:03:00.823 --> 01:03:02.657
You wait 'till the
Producers hear about this!

01:03:02.658 --> 01:03:03.533
- Ah, the Producers.

01:03:03.534 --> 01:03:04.408
The Producers!

01:03:04.409 --> 01:03:06.744
Oh, the Producers!

01:03:06.745 --> 01:03:07.579
(boxes crashing)

01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:09.038
- Oh!

01:03:09.039 --> 01:03:10.708
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:03:13.251 --> 01:03:14.085
- What you doing?

01:03:14.086 --> 01:03:15.377
Ah, no!

01:03:15.378 --> 01:03:16.379
Ah, what are we gonna do?

01:03:17.590 --> 01:03:18.255
We've got loads left to
film with her, look at her!

01:03:18.256 --> 01:03:19.465
- I don't know, we could...

01:03:19.466 --> 01:03:22.885
We could like, CG in her
live face onto her dead face?

01:03:22.886 --> 01:03:25.304
- I've seen your CG,
so that's a no.

01:03:25.305 --> 01:03:27.056
- Like, stick some human make-up
on her.

01:03:27.057 --> 01:03:27.932
And like, you can double
her lines.

01:03:27.933 --> 01:03:29.809
And Bob's your undead uncle.

01:03:29.810 --> 01:03:32.144
- I don't know, let me
just think, hang on.

01:03:32.145 --> 01:03:34.146
Oh okay, I'll get some
Jaffa Cakes.

01:03:34.147 --> 01:03:35.231
No Tony, it's not gonna work.

01:03:35.232 --> 01:03:36.273
We sound nothing alike.

01:03:36.274 --> 01:03:37.441
- I can't tell any difference

01:03:37.442 --> 01:03:38.776
between the two of you,
whatsoever.

01:03:38.777 --> 01:03:39.778
We're doing this.

01:03:41.071 --> 01:03:41.113
- Okay, we've got no choice.
- Sound dude, get in here.

01:03:42.072 --> 01:03:42.446
Mic this girl up, we're gonna
do a take.

01:03:42.447 --> 01:03:44.157
- Sc 49 ah.

01:03:46.493 --> 01:03:47.244
Four, four!

01:03:49.329 --> 01:03:50.496
- Good board, good board.
- It was not.

01:03:50.497 --> 01:03:52.164
No don't applaud that,
that was shite.

01:03:52.165 --> 01:03:52.999
- Right, is everyone ready?

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.166
- [Miles And Tony] Yes.

01:03:54.167 --> 01:03:55.501
- Action!
- Eh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:03:55.502 --> 01:03:57.169
Okay, action.

01:03:57.170 --> 01:03:58.547
And then we...

01:04:01.383 --> 01:04:02.550
- Look at the Minster.

01:04:02.551 --> 01:04:04.511
Isn't it lovely?

01:04:04.512 --> 01:04:07.429
- Yes, I enjoy how the
light is...

01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:10.725
When the sunlight through
stained glass windows.

01:04:10.726 --> 01:04:14.771
- Of the majestic Min...
- Of the majestic Minster.

01:04:14.772 --> 01:04:16.022
- Oh, yeah.

01:04:16.023 --> 01:04:18.776
The light in this shot
is amazing.

01:04:20.569 --> 01:04:21.612
- Oh god, all right.

01:04:22.696 --> 01:04:22.738
- You can't put it there.
- Oh, fucking hell!

01:04:23.238 --> 01:04:23.280
- God, all right.

01:04:26.324 --> 01:04:27.950
- Look, there's a man over there

01:04:27.951 --> 01:04:29.368
He looks unwell.

01:04:29.369 --> 01:04:30.328
- He does look unwell.

01:04:30.746 --> 01:04:33.665
- Maybe he could be the
start of an outbreak.

01:04:33.666 --> 01:04:34.666
- What?

01:04:34.667 --> 01:04:35.958
- Perhaps, yes.
- No.

01:04:35.959 --> 01:04:38.460
But then, I'll need a
weapon to deal with this.

01:04:38.461 --> 01:04:39.504
- Oh.
- There!

01:04:39.505 --> 01:04:40.380
- Oh my god.

01:04:42.841 --> 01:04:43.925
- So what I do...

01:04:43.926 --> 01:04:45.342
Shall I hit him?

01:04:45.343 --> 01:04:50.222
- Later we learn that you
should destroy the brain.

01:04:50.223 --> 01:04:51.892
- Right, which brain?

01:04:53.393 --> 01:04:54.268
Oh, its brain!

01:04:54.269 --> 01:04:54.977
Right, okay, okay.

01:04:54.978 --> 01:04:57.605
So, I hit it in the brain.

01:04:57.606 --> 01:04:58.480
Shall I go and do that now?

01:04:58.481 --> 01:04:59.524
- Mm.
- Okay.

01:04:59.525 --> 01:05:00.608

01:05:00.609 --> 01:05:01.652
- Here I go!

01:05:03.153 --> 01:05:04.654

01:05:04.655 --> 01:05:06.030

01:05:06.031 --> 01:05:08.784
(bat thwacking)

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:13.495

01:05:13.496 --> 01:05:14.790
Beautiful shot.

01:05:24.466 --> 01:05:25.967
- [Hannah] Wow, you
really smacked him one.

01:05:25.968 --> 01:05:27.093
Actually, that looked great.

01:05:27.094 --> 01:05:28.010
I'm really glad we got that.

01:05:28.011 --> 01:05:29.011
Brilliant!

01:05:29.012 --> 01:05:30.304
So, wow.

more of them.

01:05:32.099 --> 01:05:34.016
What do you think, Lyndsey?

01:05:34.017 --> 01:05:34.767
Oh where's Lyndsey?
- Oh, Lyndsey's over there.

01:05:34.768 --> 01:05:36.185
Can we, can we get Lyndsey?

01:05:36.186 --> 01:05:38.020
- Just to sort of...

01:05:38.021 --> 01:05:39.272
Nestle in there.

01:05:40.315 --> 01:05:41.649
- Oh wait no, don't put the
microphone...

01:05:41.650 --> 01:05:42.525
Don't get that close.

01:05:42.526 --> 01:05:43.610

01:06:10.596 --> 01:06:11.555
Do we need her?

01:06:13.557 --> 01:06:14.599

Okay, well this feels
horribly familiar.

- Fast zombies, fast zombies
exist.

01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:59.736
Okay, that makes the
apocalypse slightly less fun.

01:11:59.737 --> 01:12:01.278
I've gotta get the...

01:12:01.279 --> 01:12:03.656

Why are we in a scare house?

01:12:09.412 --> 01:12:12.331
I mean this is just
asking for it, isn't it?

Yeah, good.

Style under pressure.

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:26.155

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:41.170
Okay.

Now, Tony was doing that.

01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:44.966
Miles was following the
DOP, to get the film.

01:13:44.967 --> 01:13:47.510
What was I supposed to do?

01:13:47.511 --> 01:13:49.512

This way, this way.

01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:14.722
This way, this way!

01:15:14.723 --> 01:15:16.182
Through here!

01:15:16.183 --> 01:15:18.769
(cage rattling)

01:15:21.271 --> 01:15:22.354
I'm going for it again.

01:15:22.355 --> 01:15:23.023
Ah, shit!

01:15:26.276 --> 01:15:27.860
Yeah.

01:15:27.861 --> 01:15:29.904
(DOP growling)

01:15:29.905 --> 01:15:30.738
- Why...

01:15:30.739 --> 01:15:31.864
I just wanna...

01:15:31.865 --> 01:15:32.949
I just wanna get into...

01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:35.743
I just wanna have this sweet!

01:15:35.744 --> 01:15:38.245
There's not even a way in!

01:15:38.246 --> 01:15:38.913
Can I get in there, no.

01:15:38.914 --> 01:15:40.289
Can I?

01:15:40.290 --> 01:15:42.124
How do you?

01:15:42.125 --> 01:15:43.417
There's not, I haven't
got any nails today.

01:15:43.418 --> 01:15:44.418
Oh god.

01:15:44.419 --> 01:15:47.130
(Tony panting)

01:15:51.802 --> 01:15:53.595
- That was intense.

01:15:53.596 --> 01:15:55.388
That was super intense.

01:15:56.890 --> 01:15:58.224
Let's see where...

01:15:58.225 --> 01:15:59.934
Is there a way out through here?

01:15:59.935 --> 01:16:00.810
(horn honking)

01:16:00.811 --> 01:16:03.772
(zombie groaning)

01:16:12.573 --> 01:16:13.447
- Fucking help me!

01:16:13.448 --> 01:16:14.617
Help me dude!

01:16:18.453 --> 01:16:19.287
You serious?

01:16:22.916 --> 01:16:25.292
(head crunching)

01:16:25.293 --> 01:16:28.171
(blood spurting)

01:16:29.339 --> 01:16:32.424
(throat gurgling)

01:16:32.425 --> 01:16:34.176
Looks like it's...

01:16:34.177 --> 01:16:36.179
Raining dead. Wooooow

01:16:37.848 --> 01:16:39.682
Right, let's get out of here.

01:16:39.683 --> 01:16:41.308
Oh, shit!

01:16:41.309 --> 01:16:44.187
(zombies growling)

01:16:49.317 --> 01:16:50.193
I'm sorry!

01:16:54.114 --> 01:16:54.947
- Oh shit.

01:16:54.948 --> 01:16:55.657
No, no, no.

01:16:55.658 --> 01:16:56.490
No, that's...

01:16:56.491 --> 01:16:57.366
Oh, fuck.

01:16:57.367 --> 01:16:59.201
Erm, what to do.

01:16:59.202 --> 01:17:02.371
(metal clanging)

01:17:02.372 --> 01:17:03.831
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:17:03.832 --> 01:17:05.750
(DOP growling)

01:17:05.751 --> 01:17:08.127
- Yeah, laugh it up.

01:17:08.128 --> 01:17:09.712
(gunshot firing)

01:17:09.713 --> 01:17:13.424
(wrapper rustling)

01:17:13.425 --> 01:17:14.760
- Okay, I'm in.

01:17:17.095 --> 01:17:17.930
Great.

01:17:23.435 --> 01:17:24.769
Ugh!

01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:25.646
Ugh!

01:17:27.648 --> 01:17:29.065
Oh god.

01:17:29.066 --> 01:17:29.900
Ugh.

01:17:31.109 --> 01:17:31.984
Ugh.

01:17:31.985 --> 01:17:32.820
Ugh.

01:17:36.615 --> 01:17:37.782
Don't know how long
that had been in there.

01:17:37.783 --> 01:17:38.659
Disgusting.

01:17:39.577 --> 01:17:40.410
Right.

01:17:43.747 --> 01:17:44.831
Oh, Miles is here!

01:17:44.832 --> 01:17:46.666
Can't wait to show him the van.

01:17:46.667 --> 01:17:51.420
Maybe I'm gonna give him one
of those sweets. (laughs)

01:17:51.421 --> 01:17:52.505
- I got it!

01:17:52.506 --> 01:17:53.506
- Well done.

01:17:53.507 --> 01:17:54.592
I got us a van.

01:17:55.884 --> 01:17:57.177
- So, hang on.

01:17:58.345 --> 01:17:59.095
While I was being chased
around the dark by zombies.

01:17:59.096 --> 01:18:00.096
- Yeah.

01:18:00.097 --> 01:18:01.013
- To get this.
- Yeah.

01:18:01.014 --> 01:18:02.515
- You were sat in a van?

01:18:02.516 --> 01:18:04.517
- Acquiring the van.
- Right.

01:18:04.518 --> 01:18:05.519
- Haven't found the key
for it yet,

01:18:06.019 --> 01:18:06.894
but you know, it's quite
good though, innit.

01:18:06.895 --> 01:18:10.189
- It's quite good, yeah.
- Yeah.

01:18:10.190 --> 01:18:11.899
- Start the engine!

01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:14.277
Start the fucking engine!

01:18:16.530 --> 01:18:18.574
- It's Alan Grenadehand.

01:18:20.701 --> 01:18:23.286
(Alan groaning)

01:18:28.083 --> 01:18:29.416
- It's Alan!

01:18:29.417 --> 01:18:30.335
It's Alan!

01:18:33.881 --> 01:18:35.798
(gun clicking)

01:18:35.799 --> 01:18:36.883
- Don't shoot it, not yet!

01:18:36.884 --> 01:18:37.800
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

01:18:37.801 --> 01:18:38.677
Shoot it!

01:18:41.514 --> 01:18:45.141
(grenade exploding)

01:18:45.142 --> 01:18:47.936
- Jesus. (laughs)

01:18:52.482 --> 01:18:53.650
- Nice shot.
- Thanks.

01:18:53.651 --> 01:18:55.067
- Not as good as my shot,
but you know.

01:18:55.068 --> 01:18:55.777
- Yeah, whatever.

01:18:55.778 --> 01:18:56.779
- You tried the key?

01:18:57.821 --> 01:18:58.905
- There's, it's not
under the flippy thing.

01:18:58.906 --> 01:18:59.572
- You checked the visor?
- Yeah, of course.

01:18:59.573 --> 01:19:00.031
I tried the flippy thing.

01:19:00.032 --> 01:19:00.073
It didn't work!

01:19:02.117 --> 01:19:03.951
On my, on my side.

01:19:03.952 --> 01:19:05.537
- Yeah, well done.

01:19:05.538 --> 01:19:07.747
- Hiya, there you go.

01:19:07.748 --> 01:19:08.790
All right?

01:19:08.791 --> 01:19:09.832
- Did you see that?

01:19:09.833 --> 01:19:10.709
- Yeah.

01:19:12.127 --> 01:19:14.086
- Nice shot.
- Thanks.

01:19:14.087 --> 01:19:15.337
- I told you fast zombies
were real.

01:19:15.338 --> 01:19:16.632
- Oh, fuck off!

01:19:18.258 --> 01:19:19.634
(dramatic electronic music)

01:19:19.635 --> 01:19:24.681
(no camera audio)

01:19:24.682 --> 01:19:26.808
- I told you, we should
have saved the sound guy.

01:19:26.809 --> 01:19:28.017
- It's fine though, because
that's why

01:19:28.018 --> 01:19:29.519
they call it a rough cut, right?

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:31.353
- Yeah, but this is more
of a suicide cut.

01:19:31.354 --> 01:19:32.939
- Mm, there's some good
stuff there, though.

01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:34.024
I think all the people who died,

01:19:35.317 --> 01:19:38.361
would be really, really,
proud of what we've achieved.

01:19:40.197 --> 01:19:41.698
- Heard you had a bit of
a bad day.

01:19:41.699 --> 01:19:43.199
- Yeah, that's one way of
putting it.

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:45.492
- You lost half the crew.

01:19:45.493 --> 01:19:48.663
- Well, in a film production,
there's always attrition.

01:19:48.664 --> 01:19:51.583
- The zombie apocalypse,
is not fucking attrition.

01:19:51.584 --> 01:19:52.750
- It was worth it, though.

01:19:52.751 --> 01:19:53.793
If you see the footage
that we've...

01:19:53.794 --> 01:19:54.752
That we've got.

01:19:54.753 --> 01:19:55.419
- That's why were here.

01:19:55.420 --> 01:19:56.754
Play the rough cut.

01:19:56.755 --> 01:19:57.631
- Well I mean,

01:19:58.048 --> 01:20:01.093
it's not quite ready.
- Show it to us, now.

01:20:03.428 --> 01:20:06.599
(countdown beeping)

01:20:09.392 --> 01:20:12.436
- Isn't it a beautiful day
outside?

01:20:12.437 --> 01:20:15.481
It would be such a shame,
if something were...

01:20:15.482 --> 01:20:18.234
Like a zombie apocalypse,
or some, for example.

01:20:18.235 --> 01:20:20.444
If that were to happen today.

01:20:20.445 --> 01:20:24.115
Don't you think, Lynds,
er Madam?

01:20:24.116 --> 01:20:25.074
- Yes.

01:20:25.075 --> 01:20:26.951
Yep.

01:20:26.952 --> 01:20:29.328
I've got a lot of things to do,
today.

01:20:29.329 --> 01:20:31.914
- Yes and we should do
them together in town,

01:20:31.915 --> 01:20:34.917
because we like to go
blogging in town together.

01:20:34.918 --> 01:20:36.502
It's the thing that we do.

01:20:36.503 --> 01:20:39.881
And we should get Miles and Tony
and...

01:20:39.882 --> 01:20:42.593
Go into town, to blog together.

01:20:43.844 --> 01:20:45.928
- We must infiltrate
the facility.

01:20:45.929 --> 01:20:46.764
- Yes!

01:20:47.681 --> 01:20:50.224
We have infiltrated the facility

01:20:50.225 --> 01:20:53.521
- [Tony] We have to hack
the apocalypse.

01:20:54.730 --> 01:20:56.355
- Ah, they really wanna come
through.

01:20:56.356 --> 01:20:57.690
- [Hannah] Lyndsey, can you
help us?

01:20:57.691 --> 01:20:59.025
- Maybe.

01:20:59.026 --> 01:21:00.777
In my...

01:21:00.778 --> 01:21:02.862
In my bag, there's some...

01:21:02.863 --> 01:21:04.864
- I can't help you unless
I move, you see.

01:21:04.865 --> 01:21:05.865
But I can't move.

01:21:05.866 --> 01:21:06.824
- Okay, okay, oo!

01:21:06.825 --> 01:21:09.286
I have this small, right hand.

01:21:10.538 --> 01:21:13.080
- I stole the zombie eggs,
from the zombie queen.

01:21:13.081 --> 01:21:14.124
- Yes, thank you.

01:21:15.167 --> 01:21:17.919
Then I now, will put
them in the incubator.

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:21.881
Am I supposed to be wearing a
lab coat?

01:21:21.882 --> 01:21:25.718
Put them in the incubator,
and then we can study them.

01:21:25.719 --> 01:21:28.638
(Hannah beeping)

01:21:28.639 --> 01:21:29.847
- There's only one thing

01:21:29.848 --> 01:21:33.434
that can kill the queen of
the zombies.

01:21:33.435 --> 01:21:35.937
The tooth of the Megalodon.

01:21:35.938 --> 01:21:39.356
- The greatest predator that
ever lived?

01:21:39.357 --> 01:21:40.817
- The very same.

01:21:40.818 --> 01:21:42.569
Oh my god, the queen.

01:21:42.570 --> 01:21:43.945
It's grown!

01:21:43.946 --> 01:21:44.863
Destroy it!

01:21:45.906 --> 01:21:46.782
- Oh, ah!

01:21:50.243 --> 01:21:52.620
I mean, maybe we could have done

01:21:52.621 --> 01:21:54.455
more than one take of
everything.

01:21:54.456 --> 01:21:57.209
- It's very bold, stylistically.

01:21:58.293 --> 01:22:01.128
It's very good at sort of,
jerking the audience around.

01:22:01.129 --> 01:22:02.839
And I think we may have gone
too far, in a few places.

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:04.298
- It's gonna be great.
- It's gonna be great.

01:22:04.299 --> 01:22:05.382
It's gonna be great.

01:22:05.383 --> 01:22:07.009
- Is this supposed to be a joke?

01:22:07.010 --> 01:22:09.095
Some kind of undead
You've Been Framed?

01:22:09.096 --> 01:22:10.180
- Well, no.

01:22:11.348 --> 01:22:14.809
I promise, there are no
cameras in any of the toilets.

01:22:14.810 --> 01:22:15.977
- I'm speechless.

01:22:15.978 --> 01:22:18.020
- [Hannah] We didn't give
you a part.

01:22:18.021 --> 01:22:19.981
- I think we've seen enough.

01:22:19.982 --> 01:22:20.940
- Hey!
- What are you doing?

01:22:20.941 --> 01:22:22.025
Hey!

01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.526
- What we should have
done from the beginning.

01:22:23.527 --> 01:22:24.443
You're fired.

01:22:24.444 --> 01:22:26.863
(Hannah gasping)

01:22:26.864 --> 01:22:28.615
- You can't do that.

01:22:28.616 --> 01:22:30.366
- Yes, we can.

01:22:30.367 --> 01:22:31.784
It's in your small print.

01:22:31.785 --> 01:22:33.494
- Damn it, Hannah!

01:22:33.495 --> 01:22:37.164
- As Producers, we are
confiscating this material.

01:22:37.165 --> 01:22:42.378
And we will assign a new
Director, to re-shoot this...

01:22:42.379 --> 01:22:43.295
Mess.

01:22:43.296 --> 01:22:44.421
- But the perks!

01:22:44.422 --> 01:22:46.132
- We never cared about the perks

01:22:46.133 --> 01:22:47.383
- If you never cared about
the perks,

01:22:47.384 --> 01:22:49.135
then why are you making
the film?

01:22:49.136 --> 01:22:50.469
- Well, the same reason as you.

01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:51.929
The love.

01:22:51.930 --> 01:22:53.389
- It was more boredom.
- It's boredom, really.

01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:54.098
We were sort of, sitting about.

01:22:54.099 --> 01:22:56.934
- We might give you a credit.

01:22:56.935 --> 01:22:59.562
If we're feeling generous.

01:22:59.563 --> 01:23:01.939
Maybe Exec Producers?

01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:03.149
Now.

01:23:03.150 --> 01:23:05.401
If you'll excuse us.

01:23:05.402 --> 01:23:06.903
We...

01:23:06.904 --> 01:23:08.446
Have a film to save.

01:23:14.286 --> 01:23:15.953
- You can tell our
luck's changed.

01:23:15.954 --> 01:23:17.664
Because none of these
hats suit me.

01:23:17.665 --> 01:23:18.707
None of them.

01:23:20.834 --> 01:23:22.835
And I always look good in hats.

01:23:22.836 --> 01:23:23.711
God, look at it!

01:23:23.712 --> 01:23:25.171
This is awful!

01:23:25.172 --> 01:23:28.049
(sighs) What are you doing?

01:23:28.050 --> 01:23:30.009
- I'm playing myself at chess.

01:23:30.010 --> 01:23:32.178
And I'm losing.
- Why?

01:23:32.179 --> 01:23:34.346
- Because I'm depressed.
- Yeah.

01:23:34.347 --> 01:23:36.599
- Because our film got taken
away from us.

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:37.850
And we made that film.

01:23:37.851 --> 01:23:39.519
And we suffered.
- Did we?

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:40.937
- And other people suffered.

01:23:40.938 --> 01:23:43.523
And also died, to make the...

01:23:43.524 --> 01:23:45.024
I didn't think I'd care
this much, to be honest.

01:23:45.025 --> 01:23:45.942
- [Hannah] I know, me too.

01:23:45.943 --> 01:23:47.276
I feel rubbish.

01:23:47.277 --> 01:23:48.360
- And there we go.

01:23:48.361 --> 01:23:49.196
I've just check-mated myself,

01:23:49.822 --> 01:23:51.280
so that little pleasures over,
isn't it?

01:23:51.281 --> 01:23:53.616
- [Hannah] Shall we go
and see what Tony's doing?

01:23:53.617 --> 01:23:54.868
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:23:55.994 --> 01:23:56.911
- [Hannah] He can make
any shopping trip fun.

01:23:56.912 --> 01:23:57.579
- That's true.
- He'll perk us up.

01:23:57.580 --> 01:23:58.495
Wow, do you think this place

01:23:58.496 --> 01:24:01.999
has been untouched since
the 40's?

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.127
- Hannah, this is an antique sho

01:24:05.128 --> 01:24:07.171
There he is, hello Tony.

01:24:07.172 --> 01:24:08.715
- Meh.

01:24:08.716 --> 01:24:10.216
- [Hannah] Wait, what you doing?

01:24:10.217 --> 01:24:11.676
- Shopping.

01:24:11.677 --> 01:24:12.635
- [Hannah] This isn't shopping.

01:24:12.636 --> 01:24:14.428
Shopping's usually fun.

01:24:14.429 --> 01:24:15.805
Make it fun, Tony.

01:24:15.806 --> 01:24:16.639
- Yeah, make it fun.
- Make it fun.

01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:17.473
- Make it fun.
- Make it fun.

01:24:17.474 --> 01:24:20.560
- It's not fun anymore.
- Why?

01:24:20.561 --> 01:24:21.603
- We lost the film.

01:24:21.604 --> 01:24:23.145
- [Hannah] Yeah.

01:24:23.146 --> 01:24:24.480
- I thought we were doing
something important.

01:24:24.481 --> 01:24:25.690
- Yeah I do, I feel that way.

01:24:25.691 --> 01:24:26.733
- [Hannah] I know.

01:24:26.734 --> 01:24:27.942
There were all those new people.

01:24:27.943 --> 01:24:29.026
And like, other women.

01:24:29.027 --> 01:24:30.653
And actual dudes.

01:24:30.654 --> 01:24:31.904
- I'm an actual dude.

01:24:31.905 --> 01:24:33.072
- [Hannah] Well you know,
like real ones.

01:24:33.073 --> 01:24:34.198
- All right, yeah.

01:24:34.199 --> 01:24:35.825
- [Hannah] Wait, what's this?

01:24:35.826 --> 01:24:37.243
Dom and Jo Carpenter present
a Dom and Jo Carpenter film,

01:24:37.244 --> 01:24:39.036
Zomblogalypse, coming
Halloween 2029.

01:24:39.037 --> 01:24:41.080
Directed and produced by and
staring Dom and Jo Carpenter.

01:24:41.081 --> 01:24:43.374
- Are you speaking in
tongues now, or something?

01:24:43.375 --> 01:24:44.792
- [Hannah] Zomblogalypse,
that's our film!

01:24:44.793 --> 01:24:46.210
Who's made that?

01:24:46.211 --> 01:24:47.670
- The fucking cheek!

01:24:47.671 --> 01:24:49.589
- No, that's ours.
- It is!

01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:51.090
- That we, we should...

01:24:51.091 --> 01:24:52.509
No, I can't be bothered actually

01:24:52.510 --> 01:24:53.175
- [Hannah] No, you're right.

01:24:53.176 --> 01:24:54.052
We should!

01:24:54.637 --> 01:24:55.928
We've gotta do something
about this.

01:24:55.929 --> 01:24:57.847
They've taken our film, they've
stolen it.

01:24:57.848 --> 01:24:58.681
- Yeah, yeah.

01:24:58.682 --> 01:25:00.016
We go to the premiere.

01:25:00.017 --> 01:25:02.143
We swap the films, we show
ours instead.

01:25:02.144 --> 01:25:03.186
- Ours?

01:25:04.187 --> 01:25:05.187
- [Hannah] We don't have a film
to show.

01:25:05.188 --> 01:25:06.689
- We re-shoot it.

01:25:06.690 --> 01:25:07.690
- [Hannah] We can't re-shoot...

01:25:07.691 --> 01:25:09.609
Well actually I suppose if it's

01:25:09.610 --> 01:25:10.860
That comes out in Halloween.

01:25:10.861 --> 01:25:12.529
And this is, it's Christmas now.

01:25:12.530 --> 01:25:13.821
Then we've got what,
eight months?

01:25:13.822 --> 01:25:15.031
- No, Halloween's like...

01:25:15.032 --> 01:25:16.115
- [Miles And Tony] Tomorrow.

01:25:16.116 --> 01:25:17.158
- [Hannah] Is it?

01:25:17.159 --> 01:25:18.159
- Yeah, I find it really useful

01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:18.701
to keep track of time
in the apocalypse,

01:25:18.702 --> 01:25:20.953
for sanity purposes.

01:25:20.954 --> 01:25:23.080
- [Hannah] Okay, well
that's not a lot of time.

01:25:23.081 --> 01:25:25.082
- No, it is, we can do it!

01:25:25.083 --> 01:25:26.876
We just simplify everything.

01:25:26.877 --> 01:25:27.877
That's how we should have done
it all, in the first place.

01:25:27.878 --> 01:25:30.755
No zombies, no random
crew humans, just us.

01:25:30.756 --> 01:25:34.926
- [Hannah] I mean, that sounds
kinda dull, don't ya think?

01:25:34.927 --> 01:25:36.594
I mean, it could make a
fun montage.

01:25:36.595 --> 01:25:37.970
- Yeah, at least!

01:25:37.971 --> 01:25:39.388
- [Hannah] Do you wanna,
shall we do it?

01:25:39.389 --> 01:25:40.139
- Yes!
- Shall we do it?

01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:41.473
- [Miles And Tony] Yes!

01:25:41.474 --> 01:25:43.059
(egg splatting)

01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:45.979
(zombie groaning)

01:25:47.272 --> 01:25:50.275
(upbeat rock music)

01:26:05.833 --> 01:26:07.333
- Mark it!

01:26:07.334 --> 01:26:09.001
Zomblogalypse the Movie, action!

01:26:09.002 --> 01:26:10.837
Take one, scene one.

01:26:10.838 --> 01:26:11.503
- One one.

01:26:11.504 --> 01:26:12.839
- Directors, us.

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:13.506
- Scene one.

01:26:13.507 --> 01:26:14.424
Take 2,593.

01:26:16.343 --> 01:26:17.343
- And...

01:26:17.344 --> 01:26:18.220
Lights!

01:26:19.429 --> 01:26:20.262
Camera, action.

01:26:20.263 --> 01:26:21.347
Action!

01:26:21.348 --> 01:26:24.433
(upbeat rock music)

01:26:24.434 --> 01:26:25.352
- Pah!

01:26:28.731 --> 01:26:31.023
- Night vision, activated.

01:26:31.024 --> 01:26:33.944
(upbeat rock music)

01:26:58.802 --> 01:26:59.468
- [Miles] That's a wrap.

01:26:59.469 --> 01:27:00.512
- Yay!

01:27:00.513 --> 01:27:01.513
- Right.
- Hooray!

01:27:01.514 --> 01:27:02.221
- Yeah?
- Yep.

01:27:02.222 --> 01:27:03.305
- I think it was quite good.

01:27:03.306 --> 01:27:04.642
- It's quite good.

01:27:14.109 --> 01:27:17.738
(dramatic electronic music)

01:27:19.948 --> 01:27:20.824
- It's open.

01:27:25.913 --> 01:27:28.123
- Go on, go on, go on then.

01:27:33.671 --> 01:27:35.505
- Okay, we're at the cinema.
- Yes.

01:27:35.506 --> 01:27:37.590
- What film have we come to see?

01:27:37.591 --> 01:27:39.133
- You do remember why
we're here?

01:27:39.134 --> 01:27:41.177
- Yes.
- Good.

01:27:41.178 --> 01:27:42.804
- Projection booth's
through there.

01:27:42.805 --> 01:27:44.514
Hannah and I will go through,
we'll swap the films.

01:27:44.515 --> 01:27:45.933
- Oh, is that what...

01:27:47.017 --> 01:27:47.850
Yes, that's why we shot
everything last night.

01:27:47.851 --> 01:27:49.644
Okay, so we're gonna swap the
films.

01:27:49.645 --> 01:27:50.688
Right, got it.

01:27:51.689 --> 01:27:52.354
- Why else did you think we
were doing it?

01:27:52.355 --> 01:27:53.190
- Look, I didn't question it

01:27:53.857 --> 01:27:54.942
when you wanted to
do a table read

01:27:55.859 --> 01:27:56.609
of every episode of Dr. Who,
last year.

01:27:56.610 --> 01:27:57.151
- That was re-
- Shh.

01:27:57.152 --> 01:27:58.110
- That was research.

01:27:58.111 --> 01:27:59.987
Anyway, this is your
hare-brained idea.

01:27:59.988 --> 01:28:01.781
You wanted to make a movie.

01:28:01.782 --> 01:28:03.032
- Oh, was it?

01:28:03.033 --> 01:28:04.366
Oh I'm looking forward
to seeing it now, then.

01:28:04.367 --> 01:28:06.285
- Right anyway, get on with it.

01:28:06.286 --> 01:28:07.328
I'll buy you some time.

01:28:07.329 --> 01:28:09.997
- Okay, what you gonna do?

01:28:09.998 --> 01:28:12.250
- What we do best, improvise.

01:28:15.546 --> 01:28:18.381
(Tony shuffling)

01:28:22.553 --> 01:28:26.139
(dramatic electronic music)

01:28:31.895 --> 01:28:36.107
- (whispers) We go through there

01:28:36.108 --> 01:28:39.778
(dramatic electronic music)

01:28:48.453 --> 01:28:53.291
- [Hannah] (whispers) Ah,
look, look, look, look, look.

01:28:59.757 --> 01:29:00.840
- Ah, clear.

01:29:00.841 --> 01:29:02.009
- [Hannah] No one here?

01:29:03.010 --> 01:29:03.510
- Yeah, everything's automated
these days.

01:29:03.511 --> 01:29:05.678
The magic's gone.

01:29:05.679 --> 01:29:06.596
You got the film?

01:29:06.597 --> 01:29:08.724
- [Hannah] Yeah, hold that.

01:29:17.941 --> 01:29:19.275
- See.

01:29:19.276 --> 01:29:21.986
- Yeah, what a ride,
what a ride!

01:29:21.987 --> 01:29:23.655
Hey, what a crowd!

01:29:23.656 --> 01:29:24.489
Yeah, woo!

01:29:30.412 --> 01:29:33.998
- Now, we all know this
project came about

01:29:33.999 --> 01:29:36.001
in the strangest of ways.

01:29:37.085 --> 01:29:40.088
But these are the
strangest of times.

01:29:41.381 --> 01:29:43.382
Life is short out there.

01:29:43.383 --> 01:29:47.637
So you have to grasp it,
with both hands.

01:29:47.638 --> 01:29:51.099
And you all did just that,
so thank you.

01:29:52.184 --> 01:29:55.603
- All perks will be released,
after the screening.

01:29:55.604 --> 01:29:56.479
Yay!

01:29:57.439 --> 01:30:01.859
Now, we all know how hard
this has been.

01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:04.278
Not everyone who started
this journey with us,

01:30:04.279 --> 01:30:06.488
has made it to the end.

01:30:06.489 --> 01:30:11.118
Although I've seen quite
a few outside. (growls)

01:30:11.119 --> 01:30:12.620
(both laughing)

01:30:12.621 --> 01:30:15.790
So, while people might not
be here with us in spirit.

01:30:15.791 --> 01:30:20.086
They're certainly with us,
in decaying body. (laughs)

01:30:20.087 --> 01:30:22.171
Woo, what a ride!

01:30:22.172 --> 01:30:24.967
(both laughing)

01:30:26.927 --> 01:30:30.097
(Miles slow clapping)

01:30:36.186 --> 01:30:37.687
- Well done, well done.

01:30:37.688 --> 01:30:39.647
But you forgot one...

01:30:39.648 --> 01:30:41.524
Well, three things,
three things actually.

01:30:41.525 --> 01:30:42.609
- Well, what's that then?

01:30:42.610 --> 01:30:44.861
- Me, and the other two.

01:30:44.862 --> 01:30:45.862
Hannah and Tony.

01:30:45.863 --> 01:30:46.779
Three, three people.

01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:47.989
You forgot us.

01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:51.200
- (gasps) What are you
doing here?

01:30:51.201 --> 01:30:52.451
- I'm here for my moment in
the spotlight,

01:30:52.452 --> 01:30:53.996
just like you two.

01:30:55.623 --> 01:30:58.833
- Why do you keep looking
up there?

01:30:58.834 --> 01:31:00.835
- Oh there, is that
where the film's showing?

01:31:00.836 --> 01:31:02.253
Well if you could put your
film on,

01:31:02.254 --> 01:31:04.922
we could all enjoy your
magnum opus.

01:31:04.923 --> 01:31:05.924
That would be lovely.

01:31:07.092 --> 01:31:07.800
- I think you should just
go up, and have a look.

01:31:07.801 --> 01:31:09.594
- I want to watch the film!

01:31:09.595 --> 01:31:10.762
- You've seen it, already.

01:31:10.763 --> 01:31:13.641
- Not with an audience.
- Just go!

01:31:14.391 --> 01:31:17.811
(microphone screeching)

01:31:20.230 --> 01:31:24.567
Why don't we all have a
little pre-show Q and A?

01:31:24.568 --> 01:31:25.611
- Great idea.

01:31:26.779 --> 01:31:28.445
I'll do it, I'll do it.
- No, I didn't mean you...

01:31:28.446 --> 01:31:29.781
- Good evening, ladies and germs

01:31:29.782 --> 01:31:32.617
Welcome to this evening's
screening of our film.

01:31:32.618 --> 01:31:34.118
I'd like to ask you-
- Our film.

01:31:34.119 --> 01:31:34.995
- A few questions.

01:31:35.453 --> 01:31:36.788
- Goodness.
- Anyone got any questions?

01:31:36.789 --> 01:31:38.122
- Yes, any questions?
- Not you, not you.

01:31:38.123 --> 01:31:39.165
Him at the back.

01:31:39.166 --> 01:31:41.083
The one next to the ugly one.

01:31:41.084 --> 01:31:42.920
- Bloody hot in here.

01:31:45.714 --> 01:31:48.174
- [Hannah] How do you make
it work?

01:31:48.175 --> 01:31:50.009
- I think you sort of
stick it in,

01:31:50.010 --> 01:31:51.678
and wiggle it round a little bit

01:31:51.679 --> 01:31:53.055
- [Hannah] Yikes.

01:31:56.099 --> 01:31:58.059
Double yikes.

01:31:58.060 --> 01:32:01.188
(eerie ambient music)

01:32:05.192 --> 01:32:08.027
- So, I'd like to ask you some
questions about your film.

01:32:08.028 --> 01:32:10.780
That we're about to endure.

01:32:10.781 --> 01:32:12.907
Where'd you get your actors?

01:32:12.908 --> 01:32:15.409
- Well, as you know,

01:32:15.410 --> 01:32:19.246
our previous leads were let go,
due to creative differences.

01:32:19.247 --> 01:32:21.373
- Creative differences.

01:32:21.374 --> 01:32:23.084
- Yes, it is unfortunate,

01:32:23.085 --> 01:32:27.046
but sometimes, you just have
to go in a different direction.

01:32:27.047 --> 01:32:28.464
- Oh I see, a different direct..

01:32:28.465 --> 01:32:31.759
Was that direction up your
own arse?

01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:35.222
(eerie ambient music)

01:32:43.063 --> 01:32:45.649
(door slamming)

01:32:49.570 --> 01:32:51.989
- I hate uninvited guests.

01:32:53.115 --> 01:32:55.157
Aha! (laughs)

01:32:55.158 --> 01:32:57.284
- [Hannah] Tony, Tony shoot him.

01:32:57.285 --> 01:32:58.745
- I can't, he's a person!

01:32:58.746 --> 01:32:59.996
- [Hannah] Is he?

01:32:59.997 --> 01:33:02.915
- Oh ho, what's this,
ah? (laughs)

01:33:02.916 --> 01:33:04.250
- [Hannah] Okay, Tony.

01:33:04.251 --> 01:33:05.710
You've shot loads of
people before, come on.

01:33:05.711 --> 01:33:06.418
- It was an accident, though.

01:33:06.419 --> 01:33:08.212
And the rest were zombies!

01:33:08.213 --> 01:33:09.213
- [Hannah] Okay, listen.

01:33:09.214 --> 01:33:10.131
All right, everybody calm down.

01:33:10.132 --> 01:33:11.924
All right, everybody just
calm down.

01:33:11.925 --> 01:33:13.384
All right, I'm putting the
camera down.

01:33:13.385 --> 01:33:14.677
Putting the camera down,
all right?

01:33:14.678 --> 01:33:16.513
Okay, just calm down everyone.

01:33:16.514 --> 01:33:17.514
Why don't we just...

01:33:17.515 --> 01:33:18.640
All right.

01:33:18.641 --> 01:33:19.473
Oo look, 10% off!

01:33:19.474 --> 01:33:20.349
- 10% off?

01:33:20.350 --> 01:33:21.309
Ah you, damn!

01:33:23.771 --> 01:33:24.771
- Tony, shoot him!

01:33:24.772 --> 01:33:25.980
Tony, shoot him!

01:33:25.981 --> 01:33:26.814
Shoot him, shoot him!

01:33:26.815 --> 01:33:28.482
- I'll get his kneecap.

01:33:28.483 --> 01:33:32.028
(Tony groaning)

01:33:32.029 --> 01:33:33.821
- Jesus!
- No, give it to me!

01:33:33.822 --> 01:33:35.031
Its my gun!
- Get off, get off!

01:33:35.032 --> 01:33:36.365
- [Hannah] Oh my god Tony,
come on!

01:33:36.366 --> 01:33:38.535
- Okay so, tell us the process.

01:33:38.536 --> 01:33:40.119
You know, other than
sort of standing around,

01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:41.621
bossing people with your
arms folded.

01:33:41.622 --> 01:33:43.455
And just swanning off,
in your bomber jackets.

01:33:43.456 --> 01:33:44.541
You know, tell us-
- Arms folded?

01:33:44.542 --> 01:33:45.750
- About your process.

01:33:45.751 --> 01:33:46.752
- Arms folded?

01:33:47.753 --> 01:33:48.502
My arms aren't folded.
- Of film making.

01:33:48.503 --> 01:33:49.504
Well they're not now, are they.

01:33:50.422 --> 01:33:51.380
- No, no, my arms are rarely
folded.

01:33:51.381 --> 01:33:54.634
Actually, sometimes I do fold
my arms.

01:33:54.635 --> 01:33:56.385
Because it is a well known fact,

01:33:56.386 --> 01:34:00.389
that folded arms help the
blood flow to the brain.

01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:03.101
(door rattling)

01:34:08.481 --> 01:34:09.607
- Let go of it!

01:34:09.608 --> 01:34:10.650
- Give us the gun!

01:34:10.651 --> 01:34:12.569
- Why are you so strong!

01:34:12.570 --> 01:34:14.779
I can't get his finger
off the trigger!

01:34:14.780 --> 01:34:15.613
- [Dom] Get off!

01:34:15.614 --> 01:34:17.949
- [Hannah] Recover quickly,
Tony!

01:34:17.950 --> 01:34:18.783
- Get off!
- Yes!

01:34:18.784 --> 01:34:20.952
- [Dom] Get off!

01:34:20.953 --> 01:34:21.828
- [Hannah] Break his ankle!

01:34:21.829 --> 01:34:22.996
Break his ankle!

01:34:25.373 --> 01:34:26.498
- Hannah, Hannah.

01:34:26.499 --> 01:34:28.334
It's Lyndsey, it's Lyndsey!

01:34:28.335 --> 01:34:30.502
(Dom grunting)

01:34:30.503 --> 01:34:33.380
- [Hannah] Get him, Lyndsey!

01:34:33.381 --> 01:34:35.342
- [Dom] No, no, no, ah!

01:34:36.176 --> 01:34:38.553
Get off, get off!

01:34:38.554 --> 01:34:40.012
- [Hannah] Get him, go on, yes!

01:34:40.013 --> 01:34:41.681
You're the best!

01:34:41.682 --> 01:34:42.600
Keep going!

01:34:44.267 --> 01:34:47.562
(Dom screaming)

01:34:47.563 --> 01:34:51.232
(Tony whimpering)

01:34:51.233 --> 01:34:54.861
(guts squelching)

01:34:54.862 --> 01:34:55.862
- Oh my god.

01:34:55.863 --> 01:34:59.950
- (sobs) Why didn't I shoot him?

01:35:07.207 --> 01:35:08.791
(Hannah retching)

01:35:08.792 --> 01:35:09.459
- Oh my...

01:35:12.504 --> 01:35:14.380
You okay, Tony?

01:35:14.381 --> 01:35:16.132
Are you okay, Tony?

01:35:16.133 --> 01:35:16.883
You okay, you?

01:35:16.884 --> 01:35:17.925
(retching)

01:35:17.926 --> 01:35:21.555
(dramatic electronic music)

01:35:37.279 --> 01:35:39.363
- And then, if any of you get
bored during this screening.

01:35:39.364 --> 01:35:41.949
Feel free to just leave,
the doors are here.

01:35:41.950 --> 01:35:43.826
And here.
- Do you ever...

01:35:43.827 --> 01:35:45.452
Actually shut...

01:35:45.453 --> 01:35:46.120
Up?

01:35:46.121 --> 01:35:47.622
- Very rarely, I've been told.

01:35:47.623 --> 01:35:49.081
And sometimes I stop listening.

01:35:49.082 --> 01:35:50.750
And sometimes like during
this film,

01:35:50.751 --> 01:35:52.710
I'll probably stop breathing,
and living.

01:35:52.711 --> 01:35:54.921
And die.
- Oh please, if you could.

01:35:54.922 --> 01:35:56.964
If you could, that would
be really, really good.

01:35:56.965 --> 01:35:58.258
If you could just stop breathing

01:35:59.510 --> 01:36:01.594
because I would just really,
really, welcome the sweet...

01:36:01.595 --> 01:36:02.679
We all would.

01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:05.014
The sweet, sweet relief of that.

01:36:05.015 --> 01:36:08.018

01:36:09.937 --> 01:36:12.856
