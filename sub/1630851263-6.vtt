[Robin whistles, chuckles] Wow!

00:55.794 --> 00:57.709
Look at that view.

00:57.753 --> 00:59.102
Out of this world!

00:59.146 --> 01:00.732
Just like the invitation
said it would be.

01:00.756 --> 01:02.888
Speaking of which,
we still have no idea

01:02.932 --> 01:04.257
who invited us
on this free vacation

01:04.281 --> 01:05.717
or where we're even going.

01:05.761 --> 01:07.806
Do not look
into the mouth of the horse

01:07.850 --> 01:09.373
that gives you the gifts.

01:09.417 --> 01:11.134
Got it. We'll just
throw caution to the wind

01:11.158 --> 01:12.768
as usual.

01:12.811 --> 01:14.813
This house is so high-tech.

01:14.857 --> 01:17.251
-it's got a 3
-D printer
snack machine.

01:17.294 --> 01:18.861
Don't be playing with me, Cy!

01:18.904 --> 01:20.732
I'm not playing with you.
Check it!

01:20.776 --> 01:26.869
- Burger.
- Burrito.

01:26.912 --> 01:28.566
- Burger!
- Burrito!

01:30.177 --> 01:31.265
Burgerrito!

01:33.441 --> 01:35.530
Thank you, Space House!

01:35.573 --> 01:36.705
You're welcome.

01:36.748 --> 01:38.141
Whoa! Who said that?

01:38.185 --> 01:40.361
The House. I'm talking.

01:40.404 --> 01:42.014
Space House is alive?

01:42.058 --> 01:43.625
Space House, identify yourself!

01:43.668 --> 01:45.366
Of course.

01:45.409 --> 01:47.498
I am Space House
Artificial Domestic
Intelligence.

01:47.542 --> 01:49.631
Or S.H.A.D.I. for short.

01:49.674 --> 01:51.023
I am voice activated

01:51.067 --> 01:52.982
and I control
everything in this house.

01:53.025 --> 01:54.810
Space House. Open cabinet.

01:54.853 --> 01:56.507
Sweet.

01:56.551 --> 01:57.813
Attention, Titans,

01:57.856 --> 02:00.250
the other guests
have just arrived.

02:00.294 --> 02:01.164
The other what now?

02:01.208 --> 02:02.731
You weren't the only ones

02:02.774 --> 02:05.168
from the only universe
to get an invitation.

02:05.212 --> 02:07.301
Other guests
from another universe?

02:08.998 --> 02:10.826
Titans, ready yourselves.

02:10.869 --> 02:12.262
We have no idea

02:12.306 --> 02:14.066
what's about to walk
through that space door.

02:19.226 --> 02:21.184
The DC Superhero Girls!

02:21.228 --> 02:22.446
What's up?

02:25.232 --> 02:26.842
Ah! The sigh of relief.

02:26.885 --> 02:28.713
We do not have to destroy them.

02:28.757 --> 02:30.585
And we need not destroy you.

02:32.239 --> 02:33.544
Which we totally could

02:33.588 --> 02:35.155
because there's just more of us.

02:35.198 --> 02:36.939
No. We would still win
in a fight.

02:36.982 --> 02:39.681
You, for instance,
are definitely no match for me.

02:39.724 --> 02:42.118
Oh, is that right?
You don't say.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.641
Um, yes.

02:43.685 --> 02:44.879
I'm better than you
at probably everything.

02:44.903 --> 02:46.122
Oh, yeah?

02:46.166 --> 02:47.602
- Back flip.
- Triple back flip.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.389
A 3-D printer snack machine!

02:52.433 --> 02:53.521
I know, right!

02:53.564 --> 02:55.000
Does it have a Non-GMO setting?

02:55.044 --> 02:57.177
Oh, yeah. Nows you speaking
my language.

02:57.220 --> 02:58.917
- Totally better.
- Totally not.

03:00.919 --> 03:02.356
We will have
a great time together

03:02.399 --> 03:03.748
on our space-cation.

03:03.792 --> 03:05.663
Nothing is going to ruin it
for us.

03:05.707 --> 03:08.231
Isn't that right,
Batgirl and Robin?

03:08.275 --> 03:10.146
Fine. Yeah, Okay.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.322
Actually, even a small meteorite

03:12.366 --> 03:13.410
could ruin it for us.

03:13.454 --> 03:15.107
Uh, here we go.

03:15.151 --> 03:17.545
That's all it would take
to shatter that glass dome

03:17.588 --> 03:19.634
and suck all of us out into that

03:19.677 --> 03:21.592
cold dark void of space.

03:24.726 --> 03:25.988
Don't listen to Bumblebee.

03:26.031 --> 03:28.382
She has lots
of irrational fears.

03:28.425 --> 03:30.122
Attention, guests.

03:30.166 --> 03:31.907
What foul bewitchery is this?

03:31.950 --> 03:33.125
There is no bewitchery.

03:33.169 --> 03:34.736
That is the S.H.A.D.I.

03:34.779 --> 03:37.565
The house is
the artificially intelligent.

03:37.608 --> 03:39.001
I am happy to inform you

03:39.044 --> 03:40.916
that it is time
to pick your bedrooms.

03:40.959 --> 03:44.006
There's only one way
to do this fairly.

03:44.049 --> 03:45.399
Everyone for themselves!

03:46.704 --> 03:47.923
I get the room with the view!

03:48.532 --> 03:50.230
Wow!

03:50.273 --> 03:53.276
I get the room with no gravity!

03:53.320 --> 03:54.712
We get the room with toilet beds

03:54.756 --> 03:56.279
'cause we eats too many
printer foods.

03:56.323 --> 03:58.150
Yeah.
We don't need our privacy.

04:00.544 --> 04:03.155
Mmm-hmm. That'll do just fine.

04:03.199 --> 04:04.853
Cool! Water bed!

04:06.811 --> 04:08.465
Whoa. Seasick.

04:11.338 --> 04:12.948
Yeah. Thick walls.

04:12.991 --> 04:14.831
Good. Won't be able
to sleep-fly through these.

04:18.475 --> 04:20.782
The entertainment system
of this room

04:20.825 --> 04:22.436
features the holograms.

04:22.479 --> 04:24.612
Let us see a projection
from my home,

04:24.655 --> 04:25.655
Themyscira.

04:31.445 --> 04:33.708
I take it you like cats.

04:33.751 --> 04:36.885
Well, I guess that leaves me
with the only room left.

04:41.193 --> 04:43.021
Not exactly cozy.

04:43.065 --> 04:44.675
Actually, exposed ceilings

04:44.719 --> 04:46.895
and metallic finishes
are all the rage right now.

04:46.938 --> 04:49.332
But, there's actual
smoke in here.

04:49.376 --> 04:51.334
It's probably just
a therapeutic humidifier.

04:53.031 --> 04:54.859
Well, I don't like it one bit!

04:54.903 --> 04:56.470
Oh, here we go again.

04:56.513 --> 04:57.819
What?

04:57.862 --> 04:59.429
Another one
of your irrational fears.

04:59.473 --> 05:00.604
What...

05:00.648 --> 05:02.084
This fear is totally rational!

05:02.127 --> 05:03.738
I mean, look at this room.

05:03.781 --> 05:05.783
That is a legit cryotube.

05:05.827 --> 05:07.611
Ah. That's just
a space lava lamp.

05:07.655 --> 05:10.788
Bumblebee, you have to learn
to master your fears.

05:10.832 --> 05:12.964
A certain caped crusader
taught me that.

05:13.008 --> 05:15.097
Who was it? Batman?
It was Batman, wasn't it?

05:15.140 --> 05:16.533
He taught me that, too.

05:16.577 --> 05:17.752
He taught me first.

05:17.795 --> 05:18.927
I smelled his cowl once.

05:18.970 --> 05:20.711
Well, I do his taxes.

05:20.755 --> 05:22.385
- I polished
his Bat forks.
- He lets me...

05:22.409 --> 05:25.020
I think
there's something in there.

05:27.675 --> 05:29.677
Did you see that?

05:29.720 --> 05:31.374
One, two, three, four.

05:31.418 --> 05:32.941
I declare a thumb war.

05:33.985 --> 05:34.985
Good night.

05:45.693 --> 05:47.434
Ah... All this smoke

05:47.477 --> 05:49.349
is making my throat dry.

06:02.927 --> 06:05.408
Danger alert! Danger alert!
Danger alert!

06:05.452 --> 06:07.018
Bumblebee! What's wrong?

06:07.062 --> 06:08.169
There's an alien in the house.

06:08.193 --> 06:09.412
He's big and purple and blue,

06:09.456 --> 06:10.816
and like I said,
it's in the house!

06:10.848 --> 06:12.546
Oh, Bumblebee.

06:12.589 --> 06:14.417
There you go
with your irrational fears,
again.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.071
There are no aliens
in the house.

06:16.114 --> 06:18.334
Oh, yeah! Then what about that?

06:19.596 --> 06:21.381
Whoa. A slime trail.

06:21.424 --> 06:23.470
Huh. I guess
there is an alien in the house.

06:23.513 --> 06:25.472
- Perfect!
- Perfect?

06:25.515 --> 06:26.734
It's the perfect opportunity

06:26.777 --> 06:28.170
to master your fears.

06:28.213 --> 06:29.214
That's true.

06:29.258 --> 06:30.651
If you can master your fear

06:30.694 --> 06:32.522
of a terrifying alien
from space,

06:32.566 --> 06:34.002
you can master any fear.

06:34.045 --> 06:35.960
But some fears
don't need to be mastered.

06:36.004 --> 06:37.397
Some fears keep you alive.

06:37.440 --> 06:38.920
We should hide.

06:38.963 --> 06:41.009
No. We'll track it down
and face it head on.

06:41.052 --> 06:42.532
You can do this, Bumblebee.

06:42.576 --> 06:44.752
I bee-lieve in you.

06:44.795 --> 06:46.275
Then it's settled.

06:46.318 --> 06:47.600
We'll track down the alien
and we'll do it

06:47.624 --> 06:49.974
using my superior
detective skills.

06:50.018 --> 06:52.020
- I found a clue!
- What?

06:52.063 --> 06:54.022
According to my scanner,

06:54.065 --> 06:55.652
the slime is
derived from a creature
of asterozilic nature.

06:55.676 --> 06:56.807
Good work, Batgirl.

06:58.287 --> 07:00.289
That's nothing. Watch this.

07:01.508 --> 07:03.553
A detective's greatest tool

07:03.597 --> 07:05.163
is the tongue.

07:07.296 --> 07:08.689
It's fresh.

07:08.732 --> 07:11.039
It's definitely fresh!

07:11.082 --> 07:13.998
I don't think
you should be licking
alien slime.

07:14.042 --> 07:15.478
Found another clue

07:15.522 --> 07:17.045
'cause I'm the greatest
detective ever!

07:17.088 --> 07:19.743
What? Wait. I'll taste it.

07:19.787 --> 07:22.398
I think we're getting closer.

07:25.357 --> 07:27.664
Hey. What's going on?

07:27.708 --> 07:29.144
And why is Robin eating slime?

07:30.754 --> 07:32.756
He's trying to prove
he's the better detective.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.366
Also, interesting side note...

07:34.410 --> 07:35.977
There's an alien in the house!

07:36.020 --> 07:37.152
I found it!

07:45.769 --> 07:47.858
That thing looks like
it could do some damage.

07:47.902 --> 07:49.294
We're gonna need some armor.

07:54.778 --> 07:55.736
Ah, yes.

07:55.779 --> 07:57.564
Check this thing out!

07:59.696 --> 08:01.089
I can't fit.

08:01.132 --> 08:02.612
It's way too small.

08:02.656 --> 08:05.049
There's only one person
that could get in there.

08:05.093 --> 08:07.095
Oh, no, no, no, no way!

08:07.138 --> 08:09.097
The powerlifter suit is tiny.

08:09.140 --> 08:10.460
You're the only one
who could fit.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.230
Plus,
it's the perfect opportunity

08:12.274 --> 08:13.884
for you to master your fears.

08:13.928 --> 08:15.320
Ugh. Fine.

08:42.652 --> 08:45.089
You got this, Bumblebee!

08:45.133 --> 08:46.526
I hope she's safe in there.

08:50.486 --> 08:51.966
Uh... Robin...

08:52.009 --> 08:53.663
Are you all right?

08:53.707 --> 08:55.883
No!

08:55.926 --> 08:57.232
I don't think he's all right.

09:00.104 --> 09:02.454
Master my...

09:02.498 --> 09:03.673
fears.

09:08.373 --> 09:09.549
Excuse me, roomie.

09:29.351 --> 09:31.179
Uh, what's happening?

09:31.222 --> 09:32.983
I was coughing,
so I went to get
a drink of water

09:33.007 --> 09:35.139
and then there was an alien
in the house,

09:35.183 --> 09:36.769
so I got in the powerlifter
because I was the only one
small enough

09:36.793 --> 09:38.379
and then Robin mutated
and they both attacked me,

09:38.403 --> 09:40.323
so now I'm going to throw
one of them into space.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.538
Okay.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.975
How do I know which one
to hurl into space?

09:45.019 --> 09:46.281
I'm Robin.

09:47.282 --> 09:48.413
Hmm.

09:48.457 --> 09:49.719
Oh, come on.

09:54.115 --> 09:55.638
Curse that invitation

09:55.682 --> 09:57.597
for a free vacation!

10:00.904 --> 10:02.732
Wow.
This is way more comfortable

10:02.776 --> 10:04.168
than that water bed.

10:04.212 --> 10:06.257
And I can even breathe
underwater now.

10:06.301 --> 10:07.998
I finally have a superpower.

10:08.042 --> 10:10.261
Batgirl must be so jealous.

10:10.305 --> 10:12.500
Hey, Bumblebee.
How jealous do you think
she's gonna be, huh?

10:12.524 --> 10:15.005
Maybe Starro wasn't so bad
after all.

10:15.049 --> 10:17.268
...Yeah,
but you have no superpowers.

10:20.445 --> 10:22.752
Ah! The incomprehensible

10:22.796 --> 10:25.189
majesty of the Orion Nebula.

10:25.233 --> 10:26.582
Just look at that stunning...

10:26.626 --> 10:28.192
No, thanks. We busy.

10:30.325 --> 10:31.848
<i>It's time to announce</i>

10:31.892 --> 10:33.937
<i>the baker with the best
blueberry muffins.</i>

10:33.981 --> 10:35.460
<i>And the winner is...</i>

10:35.504 --> 10:36.940
<i>Robert.</i>

10:36.984 --> 10:39.116
All right. The hurray!

10:39.160 --> 10:40.422
Anti-gravity rooms,

10:40.465 --> 10:41.728
hologram machines,

10:41.771 --> 10:43.730
incredible views of the galaxy

10:43.773 --> 10:46.602
and all you wanna do
on your once-in-a-lifetime
spacecation

10:46.646 --> 10:48.082
is watch <i>Muffin Wars?</i>

10:48.125 --> 10:49.387
Space House, off.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.870
Ugh. Someone click
next episode.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.567
I don't want to watch
the credits.

10:55.611 --> 10:57.265
Yeah. Who cares
about acknowledging

10:57.308 --> 10:59.484
other people's accomplishments?
Give me the remote.

10:59.528 --> 11:01.486
But it's so far away.

11:01.530 --> 11:02.530
I got it.

11:06.753 --> 11:08.580
Thanks, Green Lantern.
That was a close one.

11:08.624 --> 11:10.626
That's one powerful ring
you got there.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.716
I know, right?
I can create anything
I can imagine with it.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.413
Power. Ooh.

11:15.457 --> 11:16.371
Can I try it on?

11:16.414 --> 11:17.894
Beast Boy, don't be rude.

11:17.938 --> 11:19.940
Yeah. You don't ask somebody
you barely know

11:19.983 --> 11:21.637
to try on
their personal effects.

11:21.681 --> 11:22.943
What's wrong with you?

11:22.986 --> 11:24.553
Sorry, Beast Boy,

11:24.596 --> 11:26.270
but Power Rings
are only to be worn by members

11:26.294 --> 11:27.643
of the Green Lantern Corps.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.036
But Beastie wants it.

11:29.079 --> 11:31.212
He wants the shiny green
Power Ring.

11:31.255 --> 11:33.431
He needs it. Lets him have it.

11:33.475 --> 11:35.042
What has gotten into you, man?

11:35.085 --> 11:37.566
And why are you talking
in the third person?

11:37.609 --> 11:38.915
I don't know.

11:38.959 --> 11:41.178
It's the ring.
It's making me crazy.

11:41.222 --> 11:44.138
It's okay. Power can have
that sort of effect on people.

11:44.181 --> 11:46.575
Especially people
with limited brain capacity.

11:47.794 --> 11:49.752
This ring
is actually so powerful,

11:49.796 --> 11:52.537
that I have
to recite an oath everyday

11:52.581 --> 11:54.757
just to remind myself
of how powerful it is.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.716
I love a good oath.
Let's hear it.

11:58.108 --> 12:00.850
I, Jessica Cruz,
of the Green Lantern Corps,

12:00.894 --> 12:03.287
pledge to respect
the incredible power

12:03.331 --> 12:05.463
of this super powerful
Power Ring.

12:05.507 --> 12:06.900
The power...

12:06.943 --> 12:08.249
The power!

12:08.292 --> 12:10.425
Beastie must haves it.

12:10.468 --> 12:12.122
And because it is so powerful...

12:12.166 --> 12:13.558
Hey! My Power Ring!

12:13.602 --> 12:15.299
It's Beastie's power.

12:15.343 --> 12:17.301
The power is mine!

12:19.129 --> 12:20.652
Give me my Power Ring back!

12:20.696 --> 12:22.219
Never!

12:23.830 --> 12:24.874
My ring!

12:28.835 --> 12:29.966
Where did it go?

12:30.010 --> 12:31.881
Well, this is my magic hat,

12:31.925 --> 12:33.491
so it disappeared.
But never fear,

12:33.535 --> 12:35.580
I, Zatanna, will retrieve it.

12:37.017 --> 12:38.583
Sorry.

12:38.627 --> 12:40.977
Huh. This is embarrassing.

12:41.021 --> 12:43.414
You know what, sometimes
it's just rabbits all day long.

12:44.633 --> 12:46.287
- I'm going in.
- In the hat?

12:46.330 --> 12:48.855
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You do not want to do that.

12:48.898 --> 12:50.770
You've never gone
in your magic hat before?

12:50.813 --> 12:51.988
No way!

12:52.032 --> 12:54.077
My hat is very, very magical.

12:54.121 --> 12:55.775
Look.
There's even a warning label.

12:55.818 --> 12:57.124
The ring...

12:57.167 --> 12:58.995
I must haves the ring.

13:01.171 --> 13:03.521
Oh, no.
I'm definitely going in.

13:03.565 --> 13:05.393
Jess!

13:05.436 --> 13:07.003
I do not know
what is in this hat,

13:07.047 --> 13:08.831
but I know
I have to help my friend.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.920
- I'm going in.
- Me, too.

13:10.964 --> 13:12.804
I just want to see
what it looks like in there.

13:13.705 --> 13:15.490
Titans! Our help is needed.

13:15.533 --> 13:17.187
Superhero Girls, likewise!

13:19.494 --> 13:21.496
Eh. They can probably
handle it, right?

13:21.539 --> 13:24.238
I mean, we don't
all need to go in, do we?

13:24.281 --> 13:25.761
Nah. It'd be overkill

13:25.805 --> 13:27.391
and way too many characters
to keep track of.

13:27.415 --> 13:29.678
Then it's settled.
Due to production constraints,

13:29.721 --> 13:33.116
we'll stay here and watch more <i>
Muffin Wars!</i>

13:33.160 --> 13:34.683
Yay!

13:34.726 --> 13:36.990
<i>Now back to</i> Muffin Wars...

13:46.695 --> 13:48.653
Look at this place.

13:48.697 --> 13:50.264
Everything is very magical here,

13:50.307 --> 13:51.874
so be careful what you touch.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.615
Whoa!

13:53.658 --> 13:54.877
Ooh!

13:54.921 --> 13:56.923
Okay. Stop messing around.

13:56.966 --> 13:58.359
Does anyone see my ring?

13:58.402 --> 14:00.622
It's gotta be here somewhere.

14:00.665 --> 14:02.885
Look! On top
of that house of cards.

14:02.929 --> 14:05.235
Or, more like mountain of cards.

14:08.238 --> 14:09.238
My ring!

14:10.153 --> 14:11.851
My ring.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.591
Beastie must haves it.

14:15.202 --> 14:17.204
Beast Boy! Get back here!

14:17.247 --> 14:19.249
Let us make haste.

14:19.293 --> 14:21.227
We cannot let
your bestial friend
get to the mountain first.

14:21.251 --> 14:23.079
Okay. But keep your eyes open.

14:23.123 --> 14:24.994
It could be dangerous in here.

14:28.693 --> 14:30.434
I feel so vulnerable.

14:30.478 --> 14:33.481
Without my ring,
I'm completely useless
as a hero.

14:33.524 --> 14:35.483
Hey! Sounds like someone's

14:35.526 --> 14:37.354
in need of an uplifting speech.

14:37.398 --> 14:39.487
Uh, what now?

14:39.530 --> 14:42.272
True power isn't found
in magic rings.

14:42.316 --> 14:43.795
Take me, for example.

14:43.839 --> 14:46.798
I have no powers whatsoever.

14:46.842 --> 14:48.104
You might even say

14:48.148 --> 14:49.758
I'm a useless lump
of dead weight.

14:49.801 --> 14:50.890
Yeah, you might say that.

14:50.933 --> 14:51.934
But you'd be wrong!

14:51.978 --> 14:53.544
True power comes...

14:54.981 --> 14:55.981
Help me!

15:18.004 --> 15:19.483
Sorry.

15:19.527 --> 15:21.268
I wouldn't normally
require this much help.

15:22.182 --> 15:23.705
Just remember, Jess.

15:23.748 --> 15:25.533
True power comes...

15:25.576 --> 15:27.143
Look! It's Beast Boy!

15:29.015 --> 15:30.190
Must haves it.

15:30.233 --> 15:31.278
Beastie must haves it.

15:32.279 --> 15:33.279
After him!

15:48.121 --> 15:49.600
We're trapped

15:49.644 --> 15:52.299
inside a giant magic box!

15:52.342 --> 15:54.475
You mean the kind
that magicians stick swords...

15:54.518 --> 15:56.085
That would be a "yes."

15:59.784 --> 16:02.396
I really wish
I had my Power Ring right now.

16:02.439 --> 16:04.224
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:04.267 --> 16:06.008
Were you not listening before?

16:06.052 --> 16:07.836
I think someone needs a recap.

16:07.879 --> 16:09.664
All you need to be super

16:09.707 --> 16:11.579
is to reach deep within your...

16:31.120 --> 16:33.427
Thank you, all of you.

16:33.470 --> 16:36.821
Because it required
all of you to keep me safe.

16:36.865 --> 16:39.128
That's how helpless I am
without my Power Ring.

16:39.172 --> 16:40.956
Look! The mountain of cards.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.697
We've made it at last.

16:42.740 --> 16:46.048
The ring...
Beastie must haves the ring.

16:46.092 --> 16:47.919
We can't let him
beat us to my ring.

16:47.963 --> 16:49.269
We will never catch him.

16:49.312 --> 16:51.532
The little beast scurries
much too fast.

16:51.575 --> 16:53.118
Got any tricks
up your sleeves, Zatanna?

16:53.142 --> 16:55.188
Oh! Of course. I'm a magician.

17:02.369 --> 17:03.587
That'll do.

17:03.631 --> 17:05.981
To the top of that mountain!

17:06.025 --> 17:08.331
Whoa!

17:10.899 --> 17:12.553
Oh! There it is. My ring!

17:14.729 --> 17:17.514
Careful! This mountain of cards
is very unstable.

17:19.516 --> 17:20.909
My precious.

17:20.952 --> 17:23.042
- Beast Boy, no.
- Beastie, yes.

17:24.652 --> 17:26.610
Give me my Power Ring!

17:26.654 --> 17:28.264
Never!

17:31.746 --> 17:33.008
Be careful!

17:33.052 --> 17:35.532
A house of cards
always eventually...

17:35.576 --> 17:37.012
falls.

17:39.580 --> 17:41.582
Precious...

17:46.674 --> 17:48.719
My ring! Where's my ring?

17:50.417 --> 17:52.071
Beastie tries it on...

17:52.114 --> 17:53.724
just one time.

17:53.768 --> 17:55.161
No!

18:03.343 --> 18:06.128
The power of the Power Ring
is too powerful for him.

18:06.172 --> 18:08.087
It's really messing
with his own superpowers.

18:19.402 --> 18:21.076
I think he's trying to use
the ring to create a weapon.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.034
What kind of weapon
can he create with that thing?

18:23.058 --> 18:24.407
Anything!

18:24.451 --> 18:26.192
The only limit
is his own imagination.

18:29.673 --> 18:31.762
A tater tot.
That's the limit
of his imagination?

18:31.806 --> 18:32.937
Hmm. Pretty much.

18:32.981 --> 18:35.331
It is very effective.

18:35.375 --> 18:36.593
I will give him that.

18:39.683 --> 18:41.685
Run!

18:43.426 --> 18:44.949
<i>Azarath Metrion...</i>

18:46.516 --> 18:48.083
This is all my fault.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.650
And I can't even help

18:49.693 --> 18:51.869
because I'm nothing
without my Power Ring.

18:51.913 --> 18:53.393
Oh... Come on.

18:53.436 --> 18:55.177
Have you not learned a thing?

18:55.221 --> 18:56.657
Recap!

18:56.700 --> 18:58.528
Every superhero...

19:05.492 --> 19:08.190
"True power isn't found
in magic rings.

19:08.234 --> 19:09.670
"All you need to be super

19:09.713 --> 19:12.194
"is to reach deep within your..."

19:12.238 --> 19:13.848
Reach in deep.

19:13.891 --> 19:15.415
That gives me an idea.

19:16.894 --> 19:18.287
Raven! Summon a portal,

19:18.331 --> 19:19.941
so that I can reach inside
the magic hat

19:19.984 --> 19:21.464
- from the outside.
- Got it.

19:25.990 --> 19:27.296
Gotcha!

19:27.340 --> 19:28.993
Wonder Woman, quick!
Use your lasso.

19:29.037 --> 19:30.037
On it.

19:31.082 --> 19:32.780
Pull harder!

19:34.260 --> 19:36.305
My precious!

19:36.349 --> 19:38.220
The ring is secure.

19:38.264 --> 19:40.527
All right.

19:43.138 --> 19:45.096
Is that you, Beastie?

19:45.140 --> 19:47.882
I shall do the hugs
and the squishies.

19:49.753 --> 19:51.451
See, Jess? A true hero

19:51.494 --> 19:53.757
doesn't need powers after all.

19:53.801 --> 19:55.368
You were right, Robin.

19:55.411 --> 19:58.022
But having a Power Ring
certainly doesn't hurt.

19:58.066 --> 20:00.938
I, Jessica Cruz,
of the Green Lantern Corps,

20:00.982 --> 20:03.289
pledge to respect
the incredible power

20:03.332 --> 20:06.117
of this super powerful
Power Ring.

20:06.161 --> 20:08.337
And because it is so powerful,

20:08.381 --> 20:11.253
I will always
hold its power tight

20:11.297 --> 20:13.864
and never let anyone
take its powerful

20:13.908 --> 20:15.866
powerfulness away!

20:15.910 --> 20:17.999
Especially not Beast Boy.

20:18.042 --> 20:20.219
I don't think
that'll be a problem anymore.

20:20.262 --> 20:21.959
My precious.

20:26.660 --> 20:29.010
Man, I love chilling
in this Space House.

20:29.053 --> 20:31.839
It's so relaxing.

20:31.882 --> 20:34.711
I, too, am feeling
the very relaxed.

20:36.626 --> 20:40.195
Ah, there's nothing like
sitting around,
watching TV

20:40.239 --> 20:41.892
while floating through space.

20:41.936 --> 20:43.894
It is certainly a relief

20:43.938 --> 20:46.288
to not be burdened with
unforeseen negative
circumstances.

20:46.332 --> 20:47.855
- [S.H.A.D.
- I] Warning, warning!

20:47.898 --> 20:50.074
What is wrong, Space House?

20:50.118 --> 20:52.076
A giant meteor
is headed this way.

20:53.164 --> 20:54.949
That is the wonderful news.

20:54.992 --> 20:57.908
A giant meatyor sounds
the delicious.

20:57.952 --> 21:00.389
No, Starfire, he said meteor,

21:00.433 --> 21:02.913
not meat-yor.

21:02.957 --> 21:05.046
I do not understand
the difference.

21:05.089 --> 21:07.091
Meteors aren't made out of meat.

21:07.135 --> 21:09.137
It's hard to believe,
but Starfire is right.

21:09.180 --> 21:11.748
This meteor is
totally made out of meat.

21:13.837 --> 21:16.076
We must do something about
that meteor
before it destroys us.

21:16.100 --> 21:18.102
I know exactly what to do.

21:18.146 --> 21:20.279
First, we need to become
rugged oil drillers.

21:20.322 --> 21:22.629
<i>Then, we need to dress up
like astronauts</i>

21:22.672 --> 21:25.196
<i>and walk real slow
and dramatic, like,
towards our space shuttle.</i>

21:25.240 --> 21:26.720
<i>After some emotional goodbyes,</i>

21:26.763 --> 21:28.287
<i>we blast off into space,</i>

21:28.330 --> 21:29.897
<i>and plant a bomb
deep inside that meteor</i>

21:29.940 --> 21:31.942
<i>and blow it to pieces.</i>

21:34.075 --> 21:37.121
Wait, isn't that just
the plot of that dumb
asteroid movie?

21:37.165 --> 21:38.906
You mean <i>Armageddon?</i>

21:38.949 --> 21:40.710
The greatest,
most implausible movie
of all time?

21:40.734 --> 21:42.910
The <i>Armageddon</i> with
all the sappy Aerosmith songs

21:42.953 --> 21:46.392
and starring America's favorite
apathetic action hero,
Bruce Willis?

21:46.435 --> 21:48.219
Yes. Yes, it is.

21:48.263 --> 21:50.787
Yeah, didn't that dude die
at the end of that movie?

21:50.831 --> 21:53.312
Yeah, but he got to ride
the bomb like a horsey.

21:55.401 --> 21:57.968
Ugh, that sounds like
a terrible idea, Cyborg.

21:58.012 --> 22:01.450
The three of us shall
come up with a better plan
using our heads.

22:01.494 --> 22:03.191
But we've only got
one shot at this.

22:03.234 --> 22:05.367
How can we be sure
your ideas are gonna work?

22:05.411 --> 22:07.851
-[S.H.A.D.
-I] You can
test them out in
the holographic chamber.

22:09.240 --> 22:12.287
That is the brilliant idea,
Space House.

22:14.768 --> 22:16.813
And I've got just the plan.

22:16.857 --> 22:19.381
Does it involve
slow-motion walking
and dramatic music?

22:19.425 --> 22:23.385
No, no, no, no.
It's much more sophisticated.

22:23.429 --> 22:26.388
I'm gonna fly over that meteor
and destroy it
with my fists.

22:26.432 --> 22:27.520
Ingenious!

22:29.565 --> 22:31.741
Take this!

22:33.395 --> 22:36.050
See, guys? I knew
my plan would work.

22:36.093 --> 22:37.747
No, it didn't.

22:37.791 --> 22:39.836
You just pounded that meteor
into a giant meat butt.

22:43.274 --> 22:44.624
Well, then, what about this?

22:47.409 --> 22:50.586
Now it is
the flame-broiled meat butt.

22:55.983 --> 22:59.247
No, you have
turned it into
the frozen meat butt.

23:04.774 --> 23:06.863
Space House, end simulation.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.301
I can't believe
that didn't work.

23:10.345 --> 23:11.955
It's okay, Kara,

23:11.999 --> 23:14.697
because I know how
we can solve our problem.

23:14.741 --> 23:17.831
No, Cyborg, we are not doing
your <i>Armageddon</i> plan.

23:17.874 --> 23:21.878
- Oh, man! Can we at least
rock out to some Aerosmith?
- Never!

23:21.922 --> 23:24.881
Friends, what if instead of
destroying the meteor,

23:24.925 --> 23:26.405
we lived upon it instead?

23:26.448 --> 23:28.189
That's a great idea.

23:28.232 --> 23:30.278
Then, perhaps,
we should test it out.

23:34.021 --> 23:36.589
I don't know, Star.
This place looks pretty empty.

23:36.632 --> 23:38.808
Do you really think
we can live out here?

23:38.852 --> 23:41.985
Indeed. All this place needs
is the small amount
of the elbow grease.

23:55.303 --> 23:59.263
Check it out, guys.
I built these cozy little
meat cottages.

23:59.307 --> 24:02.092
And I have built
this relaxing meat gazebo.

24:02.136 --> 24:05.052
I built this meat bowling alley.

24:05.095 --> 24:07.228
And I have built the meat DMV,

24:07.271 --> 24:09.578
which shall only be open
from the 9:00 to 5:00,

24:09.622 --> 24:12.494
and closed on major holidays.

24:12.538 --> 24:15.976
Tell me, Cyborg,
is our new home
not the adorable?

24:16.019 --> 24:18.065
I think it stinks.

24:18.108 --> 24:20.067
Our new home does not the stink.

24:23.026 --> 24:25.855
Yeah, it does.
I think the meat is starting to
go bad.

24:25.899 --> 24:29.685
Friends, I think
our smelly situation has
attracted some visitors.

24:29.729 --> 24:31.948
Oh, no! Are those...

24:31.992 --> 24:33.123
Meat bears?

24:36.257 --> 24:38.781
Space House,
cease this simulation.

24:41.131 --> 24:43.873
Terrific. That plan
didn't work either.

24:43.917 --> 24:47.703
It is obvious now that
there is only one person
who can save us.

24:47.747 --> 24:49.400
- Steve Trevor.
- What?

24:49.444 --> 24:51.707
You're seriously gonna
take advice from that dude?

24:51.751 --> 24:54.493
He doesn't know
the first thing about
drilling for oil.

24:54.536 --> 24:57.321
Correct. Steve Trevor
has a military background,

24:57.365 --> 24:59.541
and is one of the most
brilliant men I know.

24:59.585 --> 25:02.283
Plus, Diana has got
a huge crush on him.

25:02.326 --> 25:05.155
Kara, please.
We are dealing with
a major crisis here.

25:05.199 --> 25:07.288
I do not have time for romance.

25:07.331 --> 25:10.900
Steven.

25:13.686 --> 25:15.383
Snap out of it, Diana.

25:15.426 --> 25:16.882
You and Steve are supposed to
be coming up with a plan,

25:16.906 --> 25:18.821
not going on some virtual date.

25:18.865 --> 25:21.650
You are right, Kara.
Steve and I shall
come up with a plan...

25:21.694 --> 25:23.260
right after dessert.

25:29.353 --> 25:31.225
Yeah! Awesome!

25:32.835 --> 25:36.317
Congratulations.
I am the so very happy
for you.

25:36.360 --> 25:40.234
Me, too. I'm sorry.
I just get so emotional
at weddings.

25:41.888 --> 25:43.605
Now are you and Steve
gonna come up with a plan?

25:43.629 --> 25:45.239
We're running out of time.

25:45.282 --> 25:47.241
Yes, we shall come up
with a plan...

25:47.284 --> 25:50.374
after we cut the cake.

25:50.418 --> 25:53.464
Congratulations on purchasing
the new home.

25:53.508 --> 25:56.163
Thank you, and we apologize
that it took so long.

25:56.206 --> 25:59.209
Yeah, I was starting to think
you would never get out of
virtual escrow.

25:59.253 --> 26:01.560
Will you come up with
a plan already?

26:01.603 --> 26:03.866
Yes, Kara, we shall get started
on it right away.

26:07.653 --> 26:11.787
Space House, end simulation.

26:11.831 --> 26:14.877
Warning, warning!
Meteor impact imminent.

26:14.921 --> 26:17.401
Oh, no! We are almost
out of the time.

26:17.445 --> 26:19.795
Then can we please move forward
with my idea?

26:19.839 --> 26:21.928
I suppose we do not have
any other choice.

26:21.971 --> 26:23.756
There is no time to run
another simulation.

26:23.799 --> 26:25.975
Great! Let's do this.

26:38.684 --> 26:41.512
Argh! Why are we wasting
all this time drilling for oil?

26:41.556 --> 26:43.166
Because we have to get good
at drilling,

26:43.210 --> 26:44.317
so we can dig a hole
deep enough to

26:44.341 --> 26:45.778
plant a bomb inside that meteor

26:45.821 --> 26:47.649
and blow it up like they did
in the movie.

26:47.693 --> 26:49.825
Couldn't we just use
our superpowers
to dig that hole?

26:49.869 --> 26:53.220
No, silly.
They didn't use superpowers
in that movie.

26:53.263 --> 26:54.569
Now get back to work.

27:00.227 --> 27:02.925
Nice work, team.
I think we're ready to launch.

27:12.500 --> 27:14.937
It is a good thing
we decided to walk slowly.

27:14.981 --> 27:17.418
Yeah. Slipping on a wet floor
is dangerous.

27:18.811 --> 27:21.117
Not to mention the embarrassing.

27:21.161 --> 27:24.686
Cyborg, wait.
I can't lets you go
without saying goodbye.

27:24.730 --> 27:25.992
I's gonna miss you.

27:26.035 --> 27:27.994
I'm gonna miss you too, Beasty.

27:28.037 --> 27:30.126
You be careful up there,
big guy.

27:30.170 --> 27:32.476
Don't worry. I'm only about to
fly through space

27:32.520 --> 27:34.759
with a nuclear bomb strapped to
forty tons of rocket fuel.

27:34.783 --> 27:36.437
What could possibly go wrong?

27:47.187 --> 27:48.754
Diana, status report.

27:48.797 --> 27:51.321
T-minus five minutes
until touchdown.

27:51.365 --> 27:55.108
Then there's just enough time
to do the most important thing
of all.

27:55.151 --> 27:57.066
Ride this bomb like a horsey.

27:57.110 --> 27:58.894
Cyborg, get off that
nuclear weapon

27:58.938 --> 28:00.940
before it blows us
to smithereens.

28:00.983 --> 28:03.290
It's fine.
They did it in the movie.

28:03.333 --> 28:05.509
But you were supposed to be
piloting the ship.

28:05.553 --> 28:06.902
Will you two calm down?

28:06.946 --> 28:09.122
It's called empty space
for a reason.

28:09.165 --> 28:10.685
It's not like we're gonna
hit anything.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.300
What was that?

28:13.343 --> 28:14.756
We're drifted into
a patch of space debris

28:14.780 --> 28:16.520
which has damaged
both of our engines.

28:16.564 --> 28:18.000
Oh, man!

28:18.044 --> 28:19.151
Somebody really should be
piloting this thing.

28:19.175 --> 28:20.873
Cyborg!

28:20.916 --> 28:24.006
Not now. I need to make
an emergency landing.

28:35.061 --> 28:36.715
We're alive. Damage report.

28:39.195 --> 28:41.589
The good news is,
the bomb is still intact.

28:41.632 --> 28:44.810
But the bad news is,
the remote detonator
has been destroyed.

28:44.853 --> 28:47.160
Which means somebody is
going to have to stay behind

28:47.203 --> 28:48.335
to trigger that weapon.

28:48.378 --> 28:50.076
- Not it.
- No, Kara.

28:50.119 --> 28:51.904
I believe the honorable solution

28:51.947 --> 28:53.253
is to draw straws.

28:53.296 --> 28:54.689
That won't be necessary.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.909
I'll be the somebody
that stays behind.

28:56.952 --> 28:58.824
Are you sure about that, Cyborg?

28:58.867 --> 29:00.477
Yes, I'm sure.

29:00.521 --> 29:02.436
It was my dumb idea
that got us into this mess.

29:02.479 --> 29:05.569
I realize now that I shouldn't
look to Hollywood for ideas.

29:05.613 --> 29:07.397
I should just use my head.

29:07.441 --> 29:09.530
No!
Not like this, bro.

29:09.573 --> 29:11.314
I so upset!

29:11.358 --> 29:13.229
I gots to listen to
some Aerosmith, yo.

29:14.274 --> 29:15.623
Ouch.

29:22.195 --> 29:24.153
Sing that song, Steven Tyler.

29:24.197 --> 29:25.981
You's my only friend now.

29:37.123 --> 29:39.690
We're sorry for the way
things turned out, Beast Boy.

29:39.734 --> 29:43.172
But we have brought you back
something that will
surely cheer you up.

29:43.216 --> 29:44.608
Whaddup, my man?

29:44.652 --> 29:46.697
Cyborg, you's alive!

29:46.741 --> 29:49.309
But I thought somebody had to
stay behind to
trigger that bomb.

29:49.352 --> 29:52.442
That's right,
and some body did stay behind.

29:53.052 --> 29:54.053
Mine.

29:59.188 --> 30:01.016
You know what, gang?

30:01.060 --> 30:04.193
I am so glad we all decided to
vacation at this Space House.

30:04.237 --> 30:05.934
And who cares

30:05.978 --> 30:08.589
that we were invited under
"suspicious circumstances"?

30:08.632 --> 30:10.156
This place is the best!

30:10.199 --> 30:12.985
Attention.
Attention

30:13.028 --> 30:16.075
We will be arriving at
our destination
in just a few moments.

30:16.118 --> 30:17.903
No way!

30:17.946 --> 30:20.906
I didn't realize
our vacation home
was also a cruise ship.

30:20.949 --> 30:22.516
This is so cool!

30:22.559 --> 30:24.518
Can anybody guess
where we're headed?

30:24.561 --> 30:26.085
The Emerald Forest of Oa.

30:26.128 --> 30:27.826
The Fire Springs on Tamaran?

30:27.869 --> 30:29.915
I hope we're headed to
that good space beach.

30:29.958 --> 30:31.742
Wherever our destination
may lie,

30:31.786 --> 30:34.006
I am sure it will be enjoyable.

30:54.200 --> 30:57.246
Ooh, check out all those houses.

30:57.290 --> 31:00.032
And each one is filled with
heroes and villains.

31:01.555 --> 31:03.165
I could have shared a house
with Batman?

31:03.209 --> 31:04.514
Come on!

31:07.735 --> 31:10.607
Space House, can you please
tell us what is going on?

31:10.651 --> 31:14.220
Why don't you come outside
and I'll show you.

31:14.263 --> 31:17.484
Hello, Titans.

31:17.527 --> 31:19.225
You've actually already met me

31:19.268 --> 31:21.662
though my nifty AI unit,
S.H.A.D.I.,

31:21.705 --> 31:25.318
but now allow me to
officially introduce myself.

31:25.361 --> 31:27.233
I am Brainiac.

31:27.276 --> 31:31.324
The multi-verse's
most brilliant mastermind!

31:31.367 --> 31:33.021
What's the meaning of this?

31:33.065 --> 31:35.719
For years, I have been
collecting heroes and villains

31:35.763 --> 31:37.286
from across the multi-verse

31:37.330 --> 31:40.376
by offering them the one thing
they want most.

31:40.420 --> 31:43.553
A free vacation!

31:43.597 --> 31:47.557
And now that you are here,
my collection is
finally complete.

31:47.601 --> 31:49.559
I am ordering you to let us go.

31:49.603 --> 31:53.650
Forget it.
The all-powerful Brainiac
listens to no one!

31:53.694 --> 31:57.480
<i>Brainiac, you get over here
this instant, young man.</i>

31:57.524 --> 31:58.525
Who's that?

31:58.568 --> 32:00.005
My mom.

32:00.048 --> 32:01.441
So act cool.

32:02.311 --> 32:03.878
What is it, Mother?

32:03.922 --> 32:05.836
<i>You forgot to clean
your room again.</i>

32:05.880 --> 32:08.535
I'm sorry, but I've been
really busy lately.

32:08.578 --> 32:11.886
<i>With what? You're just
down there playing with
your little toys.</i>

32:11.930 --> 32:14.367
These people
aren't toys, Mother.

32:14.410 --> 32:16.325
They're collectibles.

32:16.369 --> 32:19.154
<i>Did you at least remember to
put on some clean underwear?</i>

32:19.198 --> 32:22.070
You know, this is getting
really awkward, Brainiac.

32:22.114 --> 32:23.985
Maybe we should wait inside.

32:24.029 --> 32:25.726
Stop embarrassing me, Mother.

32:25.769 --> 32:27.946
I'm an
inter-galactic super-villain.

32:27.989 --> 32:30.513
<i>More like an
inter-galactic disappointment.</i>

32:30.557 --> 32:32.689
<i>Look at you. You're
a full-grown Android</i>

32:32.733 --> 32:34.474
<i>who still lives with his mother.</i>

32:34.517 --> 32:37.085
I told you I'm working on
moving out.

32:37.129 --> 32:40.959
<i>How? You got no money,
no job, and no girlfriend.</i>

32:41.002 --> 32:42.438
<i>It's time for you to grow up.</i>

32:42.482 --> 32:45.006
I think it's time
we ended this conversation.

32:46.660 --> 32:48.879
Wow, and I thought
I had family issues.

32:48.923 --> 32:50.446
My mother just doesn't get it.

32:50.490 --> 32:52.448
I've tried acting more grown up,

32:52.492 --> 32:56.104
but being an adult
is really hard.

32:56.148 --> 32:57.453
Then maybe we can help you.

32:57.497 --> 32:58.846
I'm listening.

32:58.889 --> 33:00.500
We'll teach you
how to act grown up.

33:00.543 --> 33:02.893
In exchange,
you shall let us go.

33:02.937 --> 33:04.504
Deal. I'll do anything

33:04.547 --> 33:06.114
to get my mother off my back.

33:08.682 --> 33:10.118
Okay, Brainiac,

33:10.162 --> 33:12.120
we're going to help you find
a new career.

33:12.164 --> 33:14.601
And do you know what you need
to get a good job?

33:14.644 --> 33:17.038
Academic credentials,
letters of recommendation,

33:17.082 --> 33:18.387
and a polished resume?

33:18.431 --> 33:20.607
Nah, son. A handshake.

33:20.650 --> 33:24.089
Because a handshake
is the key to making
a good first impression.

33:24.132 --> 33:26.047
Now, when givin' a handshake,

33:26.091 --> 33:27.851
make sure the webbing
that connects your thumb
and forefinger

33:27.875 --> 33:30.356
connects with the webbing
of the other person.

33:30.399 --> 33:32.184
Don't you be giving nobody
no finger shake.

33:33.663 --> 33:36.101
You gots to commit to
that handshake, son.

33:36.144 --> 33:38.103
Also, make sure
your hand is dry.

33:40.235 --> 33:42.107
Don't nobody want
that swamp hand.

33:42.150 --> 33:43.586
Wipe that sweat off, boo.

33:43.630 --> 33:44.935
And under no circumstances

33:44.979 --> 33:46.502
should you ever give
a weak handshake.

33:48.896 --> 33:50.245
Nobody wants to
feel like they're

33:50.289 --> 33:52.552
shaking hands with a dead fish.

33:52.595 --> 33:54.138
And remember,
wash your hands thoroughly

33:54.162 --> 33:56.164
for at least 20 seconds,

33:56.208 --> 33:58.688
and then, after doing so,
do not touch your eyes,
nose or mouth.

33:59.689 --> 34:01.474
This is so confusing.

34:01.517 --> 34:03.128
I am not sure I can do this.

34:03.171 --> 34:05.086
Of course you can.

34:05.130 --> 34:07.393
Just remember to look
your employer
straight in the eye,

34:07.436 --> 34:08.568
maintain a strong grip

34:08.611 --> 34:10.918
and don't let go until they do.

34:10.961 --> 34:13.181
Okay, I think I've got it now.

34:13.225 --> 34:15.053
Great! Then why don't you
give it a try?

34:17.838 --> 34:19.709
Let go, let go!

34:19.753 --> 34:21.885
But shouldn't I wait for you to
let go first?

34:21.929 --> 34:22.929
No.

34:25.324 --> 34:27.500
It's time you got yourself
a girlfriend, Brainiac.

34:27.543 --> 34:29.154
But I don't know
the first thing about

34:29.197 --> 34:30.938
the dating habits of women.

34:30.981 --> 34:33.506
Oh, don't worry.
We'll walk you through
the process

34:33.549 --> 34:35.595
by setting you up on
a mock date with Kara.

34:41.122 --> 34:42.645
Now, the first thing
you wanna do

34:42.689 --> 34:44.473
is compliment your date

34:44.517 --> 34:46.345
and, you know,
give her a little gift.

34:46.388 --> 34:47.259
Got it.

34:47.302 --> 34:48.956
My, my.

34:48.999 --> 34:51.741
You're looking
very adequate today.

34:51.785 --> 34:52.873
This is for you.

34:52.916 --> 34:54.744
It's the Bottle City of Kandor.

34:54.788 --> 34:56.616
Just for fun,
I like to shake it up

34:56.659 --> 34:58.748
and watch all the tiny people
freak out.

35:00.663 --> 35:02.926
That is horrible.

35:02.970 --> 35:04.232
You don't like it?

35:05.799 --> 35:07.298
Then, perhaps, you'd like
a snapping space turtle.

35:07.322 --> 35:09.455
No, no, Brainiac, no.

35:09.498 --> 35:10.978
Uh, just give her these.

35:13.285 --> 35:15.591
Now get your date to talk about
her interests.

35:15.635 --> 35:18.507
So, tell me about yourself.

35:18.551 --> 35:20.572
- Well, I'm
originally from Krypton...
- Uh-huh, uh-huh?

35:20.596 --> 35:23.338
Boring. Can we just get to
the goodnight kiss?

35:24.339 --> 35:25.558
Here you go.

35:31.564 --> 35:33.783
Brainiac, if you wanna become
an adult,

35:33.827 --> 35:35.307
you have to
start dressing like one.

35:35.350 --> 35:37.004
What are you talking about?

35:37.047 --> 35:39.789
Check out my slick pink
vinyl white collar shirt.

35:41.051 --> 35:43.837
My totally fly Go-go boots.

35:43.880 --> 35:47.928
And my hipper than hip
jet black short shorts.

35:47.971 --> 35:50.844
How can you claim this is not
acceptable adult attire?

35:50.887 --> 35:53.890
Um, well, how do I
put this politely?

35:53.934 --> 35:56.980
You look like the mixture of
the nerd and the dweeb.

35:57.024 --> 35:58.982
A nerweeb, if you will.

35:59.026 --> 36:01.768
It's true.
I'm a complete disaster.

36:01.811 --> 36:04.988
I can't shake hands,
I can't talk to the ladies,

36:05.032 --> 36:08.340
and on top of all that,
I look like a total nerweeb.

36:08.383 --> 36:09.689
I may as well face it.

36:09.732 --> 36:11.865
I'm not cut out to be an adult.

36:13.867 --> 36:17.218
Oh, there, there, Brainiac,
we know change is hard.

36:17.262 --> 36:18.654
But with a little more patience,

36:18.698 --> 36:20.138
we're sure you'll get
the hang of it.

36:52.297 --> 36:54.081
Hello, Titans.

36:54.124 --> 36:55.865
Check out my man Brainiac.

36:55.909 --> 36:58.259
You're all grown up.

36:58.303 --> 36:59.521
Yup, thanks to you,

36:59.565 --> 37:01.131
I've got a sweet combover,

37:01.175 --> 37:04.352
a good job,
and a new girlfriend.

37:04.396 --> 37:06.963
And because you held up
your part of the bargain,

37:07.007 --> 37:08.356
it's time I held up mine.

37:09.836 --> 37:11.359
You're free to go.

37:11.403 --> 37:13.535
Wow, thanks, Brainiac.

37:13.579 --> 37:15.145
Oh, you don't need to thank me.

37:15.189 --> 37:17.017
Now that I'm an adult,

37:17.060 --> 37:19.280
I realized that
collecting superheroes
is kid stuff,

37:19.324 --> 37:22.805
which is why I've moved on to
a much more mature hobby.

37:22.849 --> 37:24.894
Destroying planets.

37:30.509 --> 37:32.554
Think of
all the innocent worlds
that will be lost.

37:32.598 --> 37:34.208
You must reconsider.

37:34.252 --> 37:37.646
You can't tell me what to do.
I'm an adult.

37:40.432 --> 37:42.216
He makes a real good point.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.889
Brainiac's mature enough to
make his own decisions now.

37:43.913 --> 37:46.089
But we have to do something.

37:46.133 --> 37:47.308
Like what, Mama?

37:47.352 --> 37:49.179
We can't take out
that giant laser.

37:49.223 --> 37:50.224
Yes, we can.

37:50.268 --> 37:51.660
As long as we work together.

37:51.704 --> 37:52.922
Wonder Woman is right.

37:52.966 --> 37:54.576
With all our powers combined,

37:54.620 --> 37:56.380
we turned that sniveling dweeb
into a full-grown adult.

37:56.404 --> 37:58.885
And if we could do that,
we could do anything.

37:58.928 --> 38:02.018
Cyborg, do you think you can
pilot the Space House?

38:02.062 --> 38:03.672
I can fly anything.

38:09.548 --> 38:10.592
Ready, team?

38:10.636 --> 38:12.290
Ready!

38:12.333 --> 38:13.334
Ready.

38:13.378 --> 38:14.857
Then it's time to blast off.

38:26.216 --> 38:28.218
His throat is closing.
We're not gonna make it.

38:28.262 --> 38:29.524
Aim for the uvula.

38:39.621 --> 38:40.621
Fire away!

38:47.890 --> 38:49.239
This isn't working!

38:49.283 --> 38:50.937
Our fire power isn't enough.

38:50.980 --> 38:54.549
That may be true,
but we are no longer alone
in this.

38:54.593 --> 38:55.681
Look around.

39:01.251 --> 39:02.644
She's right. Titans,

39:02.688 --> 39:04.690
and every superhero
and supervillain

39:04.733 --> 39:06.126
in the DC multiverse,

39:06.169 --> 39:07.169
go!

39:22.316 --> 39:24.971
<i>Brainiac, look at
Mama's spaceship.</i>

39:25.014 --> 39:26.886
<i>You are such a disappointment.</i>

39:26.929 --> 39:29.367
I'm sorry, Mommy.

39:29.410 --> 39:31.499
Nice team work, everybody.

39:31.543 --> 39:33.849
But how are we
gonna get all these people
back home?

39:33.893 --> 39:35.721
It's simple. We don't.

39:35.764 --> 39:37.157
This is where they live now.

39:37.984 --> 39:39.420
That works for me.

39:39.464 --> 39:41.553
Now let's go hit up
that space beach, yo.

39:43.729 --> 39:45.905
<i>♪ We gonna blast right off
And kick it at the... ♪</i>

39:45.948 --> 39:47.210
<i>♪ Space House!</i>
