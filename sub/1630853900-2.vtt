<i>Previously on</i> Raising Kanan...

00:23.758 --> 00:25.493
We the only game
in town now, Kanan,

00:25.526 --> 00:26.494
just us,

00:26.527 --> 00:27.795
<i>and we got shit on lock.</i>

00:28.028 --> 00:30.231
All you have to do
is sign in each session,

00:30.264 --> 00:31.298
<i>and then you can leave.</i>

00:31.332 --> 00:32.299
Either you sit down,

00:32.333 --> 00:33.467
or I can let the court know

00:33.501 --> 00:34.735
that you violated probation.

00:34.769 --> 00:36.470
My child was murdered!

00:36.504 --> 00:37.772
I know powerful people.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.640
So you believe him when he
says he doesn't remember

00:39.673 --> 00:41.041
<i>anything from the night
he was shot?</i>

00:41.075 --> 00:42.510

00:43.644 --> 00:44.612

00:44.645 --> 00:45.613
That shit's waitin' on you

00:45.646 --> 00:46.747

00:46.781 --> 00:48.482
I saw Worrell
up the block slingin'.

00:48.516 --> 00:49.617
<i>Yeah, we tried
to kill that nigga.</i>

00:49.650 --> 00:50.684
He tried to kill me.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.086
Bring his ass in
for a conversation.

00:52.119 --> 00:53.120
<i>And, Scrap,
I need you to ease up</i>

00:53.154 --> 00:54.321
<i>on throwin' them dice.</i>

00:54.355 --> 00:55.523
Police! Let me see your hands!
Get 'em up!

00:55.556 --> 00:58.559
I got a CI bellyachin'
in interrogation two.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.294
<i>Couldn't believe

01:01.762 --> 01:03.230
<i>When we met,
what'd I tell you, huh?</i>

01:03.264 --> 01:04.432
"Don't ask questions."

01:04.465 --> 01:06.467
I need you right now, okay?
Come on, come on.

01:06.500 --> 01:07.668

I can't seem to get that shit
out my life neither.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.398
And if memory serves, nigga,
you gave me my first cigarette.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.402
One of my many mistakes.

03:22.403 --> 03:23.604
What you want, Detective?

03:24.705 --> 03:26.907
Can't lie, Raq.

03:26.941 --> 03:28.475
I thought I was dead.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.545
Laying here, bleedin' out.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.448
I thought my shit was done.

03:36.250 --> 03:39.787
And your whole damn life really
does flash before your eyes.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.221
That shit's real.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.392
I didn't like what I saw, Raq.

03:46.760 --> 03:47.928
Not at all.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.565
I made a deal with God.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.235
Let me live,
I'll right my wrongs.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.907
The kid...

03:59.940 --> 04:02.343
he can't shoot for shit.

04:23.964 --> 04:28.002
Mm, somebody cryin'
about Cochise again.

04:32.673 --> 04:35.009
Shit's the best part
about you, Kanan.

04:36.543 --> 04:38.412
The part that cares.

04:39.546 --> 04:41.682
Don't ever lose that.

04:41.715 --> 04:44.485
And don't let nobody
take that shit from you either.

04:44.518 --> 04:46.587
Shit just a movie, man. Whatever.

04:49.356 --> 04:52.359
And you, you just
a cryin'-ass bitch.

04:56.463 --> 04:59.933
Yeah. Yeah.
I'ma fuck you up, Laverne.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.369
I ain't afraid
of you, kid, not at all.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.637
You think you got this?

05:03.671 --> 05:04.838
Come on, Juke,
do something!

05:04.872 --> 05:06.073
Come on, Juke!

05:06.306 --> 05:07.374
Aah!

05:11.345 --> 05:14.314
What I want now is what
I've wanted all along...

05:16.050 --> 05:18.519
...for Kanan
to know I'm his father.

05:20.354 --> 05:22.823
Had a gang of admirers
back in the day.

05:22.856 --> 05:26.660
Truth is, I don't even know
who Kanan daddy is.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.962
Truth?

05:28.996 --> 05:31.765
You gotta know the meaning
of the word to use it, Raq.

05:32.466 --> 05:33.834
When I brought Kanan in
for that fight,

05:33.867 --> 05:35.836
son was leakin'

05:35.869 --> 05:37.371
and left some blood behind.

05:37.404 --> 05:39.640
I had the lab
run that shit on the low.

05:40.808 --> 05:42.342
Paternity match...

05:43.544 --> 05:45.112
...came back to yours truly.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.351
And you can bullshit me
all you want,

05:51.385 --> 05:53.520
but you can't
bullshit science, Raquel.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.556
Well, fuck you
and your science, nigga.

05:55.589 --> 05:58.425
He ain't built for that road
you got him on.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.993
I saw that in his eyes
that night.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.696
The game ain't for him.

06:03.430 --> 06:05.632
Now, I ain't gonna knock Kanan
for poppin' me.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.937
I deserved what happened
that night.

06:12.406 --> 06:13.941
Divine justice-type shit.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.645
But I'm way past waitin'
on you to tell him.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.547
That was my big mistake,

06:20.581 --> 06:22.483
trusting that you would
tell him for me.

06:22.516 --> 06:23.884
I should have done it
from the start,

06:23.917 --> 06:26.053
but I thought it'd be better
if he heard it from you first.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.957
But now I'ma tell him
my damn self.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.627
Man-to-man, father to son.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.432
I'm going home.

06:39.466 --> 06:41.034
Somebody tellin', Raq.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.770
You got a snitch.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.710
One-eyed Jack. The gambler.

06:51.745 --> 06:52.713
Scrap?

06:52.746 --> 06:54.648
He workin' with us.

06:54.681 --> 06:55.883
Saw him sittin'
with a detective

06:55.916 --> 06:57.751
at the precinct
the other night.

06:57.785 --> 07:00.587
- Bullshit.
- Real shit.

07:00.621 --> 07:01.755
And I'm only telling you this

07:01.789 --> 07:03.957
'cause I'm trying
to look out for our son.

07:03.991 --> 07:07.161
'Cause that's what parents do,
protect they kids.

07:07.194 --> 07:08.729
Yeah.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.864
Kanan 'bout to know, Raq.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.700
Kanan 'bout to know.

07:26.180 --> 07:27.181

have in common are triggers.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.990
Could be someone
cutting you off in traffic.

09:50.023 --> 09:52.592
Could be someone standing
too close to us on the subway.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.295
Could be someone
interrupting us

09:55.329 --> 09:57.264
or-or talking over us.

09:57.297 --> 10:00.233

I don't like being ignored.

10:04.838 --> 10:08.976
When people don't listen to me
or hear me, I get angry.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.812
[Renée] <i>Feeling unseen.</i>

10:11.845 --> 10:14.982
Is there anyone else here
who gets angry

10:15.015 --> 10:17.818
when they don't feel heard
or acknowledged?

10:19.386 --> 10:20.387
See?

10:21.388 --> 10:22.889
You're not alone, Gerald.

10:24.324 --> 10:28.895
Anybody else wanna share
what triggers their anger?

10:31.631 --> 10:33.300
When people lie, I get pissed.

10:34.668 --> 10:36.737
Too pissed,
even if it's my kids.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.639
No one likes it
when someone lies to them.

10:40.307 --> 10:43.243
But the challenge here
isn't the anger itself

10:43.276 --> 10:46.780
but, rather,
the intensity of the anger.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.751
Everybody hear that?

10:50.784 --> 10:53.720
Anger is not the problem.

10:53.754 --> 10:54.988
Everyone gets angry.

10:55.889 --> 10:59.693
It's how we manage it
that's our challenge.

10:59.726 --> 11:01.762
And what about you, Marvin?

11:02.763 --> 11:04.264
<i>What are your triggers?</i>

11:06.033 --> 11:08.168
Yes, Marvin, you.

11:10.837 --> 11:13.073
I'm straight.
Ain't got no triggers.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.341
I'm good.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.309
You wouldn't be sitting here
with the rest of us

11:16.343 --> 11:18.045
if you were good.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.983
I'm ignoring you, Joe...

11:23.016 --> 11:24.451
...'cause I know
you love that shit.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.086
Fuck you.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.356
Still ignoring you, motherfucker.

11:29.389 --> 11:30.757
And I ain't seein' you.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.094
I'll kick your ass right here,

11:34.127 --> 11:35.762
right fucking now!

11:38.799 --> 11:40.167
I wish you'd try.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.135
All right, all right,
that's enough.

11:43.003 --> 11:45.138
Let's not lose our heads here.

11:45.172 --> 11:46.740
Or our hair.

11:47.340 --> 11:48.842
[Renée] <i>Sit down, Gerald.</i>

11:48.875 --> 11:50.277
Yeah, sit down, G.

11:59.286 --> 12:00.854
I'm gonna let you slide today...

12:00.887 --> 12:02.923
...Marvin,

12:02.956 --> 12:04.324
but you are not off the hook,

12:04.357 --> 12:06.126
<i>not by a long shot.</i>

12:08.795 --> 12:10.897
So getting back
to what triggers us...

12:16.002 --> 12:18.071
Hey, you seen Kanan?

12:18.105 --> 12:21.041
Mm... he over at Famous'.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.309
Well, if you see him before me,

12:22.342 --> 12:24.811
you let him know
I'm looking for him.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.246
Trying to keep better track
of your cousin

12:26.279 --> 12:27.781
now that he's home.

12:27.814 --> 12:29.182
If I see him, I'll tell him.

12:29.216 --> 12:30.951
All right. Thank you, baby.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.018
Um...

12:34.888 --> 12:36.990
...do you...

12:37.023 --> 12:38.525
you remember my mom at all?

12:40.127 --> 12:41.194
Of course.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.430
What you remember about her?

12:46.099 --> 12:48.502
Well, Kenya was a hell
of a good singer,

12:48.535 --> 12:50.003
just like you.

12:50.036 --> 12:51.304
And she gave you that gift.

12:52.239 --> 12:55.142
And then she bounced.

12:56.109 --> 13:00.013
Look... it's a lot, Juke,

13:00.046 --> 13:01.481
being somebody's mother.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.519
I mean...

13:05.552 --> 13:08.021
you bring a baby
into this world, and...

13:08.054 --> 13:09.990
then it's all on you.

13:10.023 --> 13:11.258
<i>Fathers matter.</i>

13:11.291 --> 13:12.893
<i>I mean, I'm not saying
they don't, but...</i>

13:12.926 --> 13:16.029
mothers, we create life.

13:16.062 --> 13:18.365
And that shit
is a lot of responsibility,

13:18.398 --> 13:20.867
and it ain't for everybody.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.402
Not everybody up for the job.

13:23.837 --> 13:28.308
So... that's why my mom
left me.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.977
She wasn't feeling
cut out for the job.

13:32.479 --> 13:33.513
I mean...

13:35.515 --> 13:37.184
...look, I ain't ever
talked to her about it.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.955
But yeah, um...

13:41.988 --> 13:43.323
I mean, I think she knew
that she wasn't cut out

13:43.356 --> 13:44.858
to be a mother.

13:44.891 --> 13:47.093
<i>Figured it was best
if she got out the mix.</i>

13:49.563 --> 13:51.965
I almost understand that.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.068
Maybe even respect it
a little bit.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.537
I can't.

13:59.005 --> 14:00.006
Shit.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.209
I can't neither.

14:10.383 --> 14:13.119
She missed out,

14:13.153 --> 14:15.322
'cause you're incredible.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.890
And I love you.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.060
Come here.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.101
See you later.

14:31.204 --> 14:34.908
<i>For months now,
I have tried very hard</i>

14:34.941 --> 14:36.543
to come up
with a rational explanation

14:36.576 --> 14:39.012
for why you instructed
those officers

14:39.045 --> 14:41.514
to free the person
who murdered my daughter.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.317
I'm sorry for your loss,
Mrs. Bingham. I really am.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.453
But Laverne Thomas
did not murder your daughter.

14:46.486 --> 14:48.121
She gave Nicole the drugs.

14:48.154 --> 14:49.422
She showed her how to use them,

14:49.456 --> 14:51.424
which is no different
than pointing a loaded gun

14:51.458 --> 14:53.293
at my daughter's head
and pulling the trigger.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.295
Look, I reviewed the case file,

14:55.328 --> 14:57.063
and there's no evidence
that suggests

14:57.097 --> 14:58.665
that Laverne Thomas
provided the drugs

14:58.898 --> 15:00.233
that killed Nicole Bingham.

15:02.969 --> 15:04.504
What does the mayor say?

15:04.537 --> 15:06.539
Does he have
an opinion on this?

15:06.573 --> 15:09.376
Well, I-I'm not here today
to speak for the mayor.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.011
He told me
that you and your husband

15:11.044 --> 15:13.213
are acquaintances of his,

15:13.246 --> 15:16.483
and he asked me simply
to observe these proceedings.

15:19.319 --> 15:21.688
I want her fired.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.491
She should not be
a police officer.

15:24.524 --> 15:27.661
Our officers often have
informal arrangements

15:27.694 --> 15:29.329
with the people in
the neighborhoods they police,

15:29.362 --> 15:32.699
but I can assure you that
no officer in this department

15:32.932 --> 15:35.001
would protect a suspect
in a murder.

15:37.671 --> 15:39.472
As far as I'm concerned,

15:39.506 --> 15:43.310
you all have my daughter's
blood on your hands.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.289
Thanks for having my back, Captain.

15:56.323 --> 16:00.126
I'm looking out for the
department, Burke, not you.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.662
You should never have
stuck your nose in this mess.

16:02.696 --> 16:04.030
<i>From where I'm sitting,</i>

16:04.064 --> 16:06.032
looks to me like
you fucked this all up.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.335
Go!

16:17.110 --> 16:18.311
Yo, whoever's
speaking this shit

16:18.345 --> 16:19.312
got it wrong.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.414
Wasn't Scrappy
in that precinct.

16:21.448 --> 16:22.749
Yeah, well, how many
one-eyed motherfuckers

16:22.982 --> 16:24.250
walkin' around
South Jamaica, Lou?

16:24.284 --> 16:26.419
Early Tyler uncle got one eye.

16:26.453 --> 16:29.622
Lost the other shit
in a fight out in Ozone Park.

16:29.656 --> 16:32.258
Yeah, well, Early Tyler uncle
100 years old, in a wheelchair,

16:32.292 --> 16:33.993
and can't feel
the left side of his face.

16:34.027 --> 16:35.528
Actually, that shit's starting

16:35.562 --> 16:37.530
to come back to life
a little bit.

16:37.564 --> 16:40.033
Saw him at the barber
a few weeks back.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.535
Lip was moving a little bit
on the left side.

16:42.569 --> 16:45.004
Scrap ain't no snitch.

16:45.038 --> 16:47.107
You know, a lot of niggas
get caught

16:47.140 --> 16:48.475
behind them cards and dice,

16:48.508 --> 16:49.642
make bets they can't cover.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.344
I told him to stay away
from that shit.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.581
Scrap bled for us, Raq.

16:54.614 --> 16:57.450
He lost his fuckin' eye for us.

16:57.484 --> 16:59.552
Maybe that's why he pissed off
behind that shit.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.621
Look, we not making
no decisions yet.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.289
We gonna need to know more.

17:03.323 --> 17:04.357
Marvin, you talk to Scrappy.

17:04.391 --> 17:05.392
Feel him out.

17:05.425 --> 17:06.693
See what he gotta say.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.759
Told my mama
I'm meeting with you all, so...

17:39.793 --> 17:41.761
if I don't walk outta here,

17:41.795 --> 17:43.797
she gonna know it was you.

17:43.830 --> 17:46.132
Well, if we wanted you dead,
you'd be gone already, nigga.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.333
Sit the fuck down.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.485
I mean, fuck it, like,

18:05.518 --> 18:08.321
I'll sleep in-
in the-in the-in the bathroom.

18:08.354 --> 18:09.856
Just throw a blanket
in the tub, like--

18:10.089 --> 18:11.825
We already
got Juke at the house.

18:11.858 --> 18:15.428
Like I-like I said, man,
if it was up to just me,

18:15.462 --> 18:17.464
hell yeah, you could
come stay at the crib.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.265
But my mother not going
for that shit.

18:19.299 --> 18:21.568
She only want family
staying at the spot.

18:21.601 --> 18:25.238
Man, I need to get
some fuckin' money, man,

18:25.271 --> 18:27.740
try and stay in a room
for a minute.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.776
What you think about
hustlin' up my mixtapes,

18:29.809 --> 18:31.344
<i>sellin' them shits?</i>

18:31.377 --> 18:32.879
Famous, them shits
didn't move before.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.781
Why the fuck
would they move now?

18:34.814 --> 18:37.150
My lyricism was ahead
of its time, okay?

18:37.183 --> 18:38.685
Heads need to catch
the fuck up.

18:38.718 --> 18:41.287
And you think
they all caught up now?

18:41.321 --> 18:44.657
I'm not tryin' to sleep
on the fuckin' train, a'ight?

18:45.558 --> 18:47.760
All I got to my name
is a bag of funky-ass clothes

18:47.794 --> 18:50.763
and a gang of mixtapes
that we might be able to sell,

18:50.797 --> 18:52.465
unless you got a better idea.

18:54.534 --> 18:55.802
<i>All right, then.</i>

18:58.605 --> 19:00.206
<i>So why y'all
wanna fuck with me?</i>

19:00.240 --> 19:02.242
And why would I
wanna fuck with y'all?

19:02.275 --> 19:03.877
Southside ours, Worrell.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.478
I mean, you might be doing
a half day's business

19:05.512 --> 19:07.380
a couple times a week
on one of them tired corners,

19:07.413 --> 19:10.750
but that's about as good
as it's gonna get for you, son.

19:10.783 --> 19:13.219
I mean, you just-you just
picking up our scraps.

19:13.253 --> 19:15.655
But maybe you thinking that now
that 'Nique out the joint,

19:15.688 --> 19:17.590
he gonna pick up
where he left off, right?

19:17.624 --> 19:19.292
<i>That shit gonna get better?</i>

19:19.325 --> 19:21.227
Nah, son.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.695
Your man radioactive.

19:24.797 --> 19:26.466
'Nique shit deader than dead.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.468
Deen ain't gonna sell to him.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.270
Nobody gonna fuck with him.

19:30.303 --> 19:31.871
You steady starving, nigga.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.575
But you still ain't even answer
my first question.

19:36.543 --> 19:38.678
Why y'all wanna mess with me?

19:38.711 --> 19:41.514
'Cause we got a lot of history
between us,

19:41.548 --> 19:43.216
and ain't none of it good.

19:43.249 --> 19:44.350
<i>History's the past, Worrell.</i>

19:44.384 --> 19:46.419
We here talking
about the future.

19:46.452 --> 19:47.654
We know
you a hell of an earner,

19:47.687 --> 19:49.222
that you on your business,

19:49.255 --> 19:51.291
and we feel like...

19:51.324 --> 19:53.326
you could add some value
to what we trying to do.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.328
And you hungry-ass niggas

19:55.361 --> 19:57.397
all runnin' around roughshod
out there,

19:57.430 --> 19:59.599
bumpin' into each other,
breakin' shit--

19:59.632 --> 20:01.434
that noise bring police.

20:01.467 --> 20:04.437
And police bad
for everybody business.

20:04.470 --> 20:07.340
You gonna be under Lou
at our new spot

20:07.373 --> 20:08.775
over at the Forties.

20:12.946 --> 20:14.380
And you good with that?

20:15.315 --> 20:17.350
We ain't datin', nigga.

20:17.383 --> 20:18.885
We workin'.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.569
I said it before,
but now that I'm here,

20:36.603 --> 20:39.672
these shits really feel
like they been warmed over.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.542
That's all I got, man.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.616
Y'all delinquents
robbin' my fucking place?

20:49.649 --> 20:50.984
Nah, man. What's up, Uncle Lou?

20:51.017 --> 20:52.285
What's good?

20:54.287 --> 20:57.457
Fame's mother actually
kicked him out the crib.

20:57.490 --> 20:58.891
And he came up here
'cause he think

20:58.925 --> 21:00.526
he might be able to sell
the rest of these tapes,

21:00.560 --> 21:02.028
get some rent money up.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.330
Obviously, he gonna
give you your cut too.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.833
Yo, fuck it.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.534
It's yours.

21:08.568 --> 21:11.738
I already, uh,
wrote the shit off anyway.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.506
<i>Word?</i>

21:13.539 --> 21:14.974
Yo, come here.

21:17.343 --> 21:19.812
You need some new flows, man.

21:19.846 --> 21:22.448
Just like I told your sister,
stop smoking weed.

21:22.482 --> 21:24.017
Put something on paper.

21:24.050 --> 21:26.753
You bring me something good, then...

21:26.786 --> 21:28.421
I'll put you back
in the studio.

21:28.454 --> 21:30.623
- Word?
- Word is bond.

21:33.459 --> 21:34.761
No doubt.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.498
Peace, Nephew.

21:38.531 --> 21:39.866
Thanks again, Unc.

21:40.933 --> 21:42.969
<i>I put down the traps
and the poison,</i>

21:43.002 --> 21:45.371
<i>but the rats are too many.</i>

21:48.808 --> 21:51.044
Guess I got rat problems
all over right about now.

21:56.849 --> 21:58.751
Throw out the shit
that's been eaten,

21:58.785 --> 22:01.854
- and put some more traps down.
-

22:01.888 --> 22:04.824
I would have to change them
ten times a day.

22:05.725 --> 22:07.527
Call an exterminator, Juliana.

22:10.430 --> 22:12.498
You have all this money
sitting here.

22:13.633 --> 22:15.702
Why don't you spend it?

22:15.735 --> 22:17.603
Now, I save my money
to buy a home

22:17.637 --> 22:19.872
for my family in my country, and...

22:19.906 --> 22:23.509
you save your money
to be eaten by rats?

22:28.614 --> 22:29.882
Get an exterminator out here.

How you livin', Scrap?

23:25.872 --> 23:28.074
Large as fuck, nigga.

23:28.107 --> 23:30.076
Moving this weight,
makin' this money.

23:30.109 --> 23:32.111
Couldn't raise you last night.

23:32.145 --> 23:33.412
Had a pickup.

23:34.113 --> 23:36.849
I was, uh, helpin' my peoples
out in Corona

23:36.883 --> 23:38.618
put some shit up on the walls.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.521
Yo, who the fuck trusting

23:41.554 --> 23:43.055
your one eye
to hang up something?

23:43.089 --> 23:45.091
Motherfucker got paintings
up all crooked

23:45.124 --> 23:47.093
and-and-and-and twisted
and shit.

23:47.126 --> 23:48.895
You should've called
the new guy,

23:48.928 --> 23:51.898
Worrell, to help you out
last night.

23:52.632 --> 23:54.167
I'm sure that nigga's
always available.

23:56.035 --> 23:57.737
Word travel fast, yeah?

23:57.770 --> 24:00.673
Especially when heads
hear your peoples

24:00.706 --> 24:02.475
gettin' in the bed
with the same nigga

24:02.508 --> 24:04.577
who cost you
half your fuckin' eyes.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.679
Uh-oh.

24:06.712 --> 24:09.182
Somebody's feelings
gettin' hurt out here.

24:10.616 --> 24:12.552
Ain't about feelings, Marvin.

24:12.585 --> 24:15.021
Shit was bad enough
when Kanan came in.

24:16.088 --> 24:17.690
But I made peace with that.

24:17.723 --> 24:19.692
That's Raq's kid, and, hell,

24:19.725 --> 24:21.627
I actually like
the little nigga.

24:21.661 --> 24:25.498
But y'all givin' Forty Projects
to Unique's boy instead of me?

24:26.933 --> 24:29.735
I been down with y'all niggas
since I was 14!

24:30.870 --> 24:33.539
Looking out, baggin',
soldiering, hustlin', cookin'.

24:33.573 --> 24:35.775
Whatever needed to get done,
I done done it!

24:38.644 --> 24:40.046
You know what?

24:40.079 --> 24:41.080
On the real...

24:42.648 --> 24:44.984
...it ain't easy

24:45.017 --> 24:46.752
hangin' pictures with one eye.

24:47.987 --> 24:51.591
Fact, it ain't easy
tyin' my shoes,

24:51.624 --> 24:54.160
seein' street signs,
or doing damn near anything

24:54.193 --> 24:55.494
with one fuckin' eye.

24:55.528 --> 24:56.863
I gave that shit up
for y'all niggas

24:56.896 --> 24:59.065
and still came back swingin'.

24:59.098 --> 25:02.501
But here I am passed
the fuck over for 'Nique's guy?

25:06.072 --> 25:09.075
So who you hangin' pictures for
out in Corona?

25:11.043 --> 25:13.546
Yo, didn't even know
you had peoples out there.

25:17.583 --> 25:20.119
My cousin Ebony.
Fuck does it matter?

25:20.152 --> 25:21.621
Don't matter.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.626
Y'all doing me wrong, Marvin,

25:26.659 --> 25:27.894
and you know this.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.665
Yo, we got you, Scrap.

25:32.698 --> 25:34.000
Don't even trip.

25:41.274 --> 25:43.576
Four bedrooms,
three full baths.

25:43.609 --> 25:45.645
Colonial on a quiet street
in Hollis.

25:45.678 --> 25:47.313
It's a steal at that price.

25:51.584 --> 25:55.621
What about Forest Hills,
Douglaston, Little Neck?

25:55.655 --> 25:58.024
I think you'll find those
neighborhoods are pricier.

25:59.125 --> 26:00.626
What, it look like
I can't afford them?

26:00.660 --> 26:03.129
Oh, of course not, no.

26:03.162 --> 26:04.697
Sometimes buyers
don't understand

26:04.730 --> 26:06.065
they need to have strong credit

26:06.098 --> 26:08.935
to secure preapproval
for a mortgage from a lender.

26:10.937 --> 26:13.172
- I'm paying cash.
- Oh, wonderful!

26:13.205 --> 26:15.875
Fantastic.

26:15.908 --> 26:17.143
Uh, but just to be clear,

26:17.176 --> 26:18.945
you'll still need
proof of income,

26:18.978 --> 26:20.947
your last two years'
tax returns, at least,

26:20.980 --> 26:22.181
and bank statements.

26:23.616 --> 26:24.750
I got all that.

26:27.086 --> 26:29.155
You just make sure
that you find me a spot

26:29.188 --> 26:30.990
in one of them
pricier neighborhoods

26:31.023 --> 26:32.692
you're talking about.

27:42.995 --> 27:44.263
Yeah?

27:44.296 --> 27:46.065
You, uh, Miss Ebony, right?

27:46.098 --> 27:47.366
Who asking?

27:47.400 --> 27:49.101
New handyman in the area.

27:49.135 --> 27:50.336
Your neighbors up the block
was sayin'

27:50.369 --> 27:52.038
you might got some work
that need doin'.

27:52.071 --> 27:53.839
Sayin' you got your cousin
or somethin'

27:53.873 --> 27:55.107
hangin' pictures and shit.

27:55.141 --> 27:56.375
I don't talk to my neighbors,

27:56.409 --> 27:57.943
and I don't talk
to no cousins neither,

27:57.977 --> 27:59.311
so who the hell are you?

27:59.345 --> 28:00.946
'Cause you don't look like
no handyman to me.

28:00.980 --> 28:02.448
Where your tools
and your work belt?

28:03.282 --> 28:05.885
I don't walk around
with that heavy shit on me.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.455
I'm just saying that, you know,

28:09.688 --> 28:11.457
maybe you-you have some gutters
that need cleanin'

28:11.690 --> 28:13.259
or lines that need flushin'

28:13.292 --> 28:15.227
or paintings that need hanging.

28:15.261 --> 28:18.064
Last shit I put up on my wall
was a <i>Thriller</i> poster.

28:18.097 --> 28:19.899
That was 1982.

28:19.932 --> 28:23.002
Well, if you get a poster
for the new MJ record,

28:23.035 --> 28:24.937
let me know.

28:24.970 --> 28:27.440
Wait, where you goin'?
What's your name?

28:28.374 --> 28:29.875
<i>You got a card?</i>

28:33.279 --> 28:35.147
What type of handyman

28:50.029 --> 28:54.900
<i>♪ You and I together

28:54.934 --> 28:57.002
I just don't hear it.

28:57.036 --> 28:58.370
Then you ain't listenin'.

28:59.305 --> 29:00.973
This girl is the next,
next shit.

29:01.006 --> 29:02.908
She gonna change the game.

29:02.942 --> 29:05.244
- We signing her.
- No. No, we not.

29:05.277 --> 29:08.214
Lou, this a partnership,
a democracy and shit.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.483
That means we-we both
gotta believe in the artist.

29:10.516 --> 29:11.984
What are you listening to?

29:12.017 --> 29:15.121
Seeing as I'm financing
this fuckin' democracy,

29:15.154 --> 29:17.356
my vote counts
more than yours, correct?

29:20.392 --> 29:23.863
- I guess it--
-

29:23.896 --> 29:26.365
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir!

29:26.398 --> 29:28.167
<i>Cartier "Duns" Fareed.</i>

29:28.200 --> 29:30.769
<i>My man was

29:30.803 --> 29:33.272
<i>Big, bright,

<i>Had vision beyond the game--</i>

<i>music, art, uptown, downtown.</i>

29:38.377 --> 29:41.780
<i>His money was so clean,
you could eat off that shit.</i>

29:43.449 --> 29:45.551
Well, if it isn't
Lou-Lou Thomas,

29:45.784 --> 29:47.386
the fast-talking pretty nigga

29:47.419 --> 29:50.789
who thinks he can roll up
on my niece at a red light

29:50.823 --> 29:52.391
with all that light-skinned
smoothness of his.

29:52.424 --> 29:54.426
Cartier Fareed is officially
up in the building.

29:54.460 --> 29:57.096
Hey, Zisa, why you ain't
tell me he was your uncle?

29:57.129 --> 29:58.964
<i>I for sure
would've kept driving.</i>

29:58.998 --> 30:00.065
I'm not his niece.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.268
Cartier Fareed.

30:02.301 --> 30:03.969
Crown Camacho.

30:04.003 --> 30:06.572
Cartier Fareed
is in that import-export thing.

30:08.007 --> 30:10.876
He's a top-of-the-food-chain-
type motherfucker, huh?

30:10.910 --> 30:13.512
And I'm still hungry.
Now, look here, niggas.

30:13.546 --> 30:17.349
I'ma make this short, sweet,
and nonnegotiable.

30:17.383 --> 30:20.352
I've got this small
music management group

30:20.386 --> 30:24.990
that I've been evolving slowly
but strategically.

30:25.024 --> 30:27.893
A collection
of carefully curated artists

30:27.927 --> 30:30.563
that I can hone,
train, and guide.

30:30.596 --> 30:32.865
And Zisa here,

30:32.898 --> 30:35.834
she's the cream
of the proverbial crop.

30:36.936 --> 30:39.438
Look, I see you got
a fledgling operation in here,

30:39.471 --> 30:42.107
<i>but it's highly unlikely
that you can give Zisa</i>

30:42.141 --> 30:46.111
the long-term and lucrative
deal that she deserves.

30:46.145 --> 30:48.380
But I know Lou from Lanes

30:48.414 --> 30:51.383
and all the other hot spots
that we hit.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.118
<i>I propose</i>

30:53.152 --> 30:55.187
that we do something that will

30:55.221 --> 30:57.389
be equitable for all sides.

30:57.423 --> 30:59.024
<i>A single deal.</i>

30:59.058 --> 31:02.861
<i>Together,
we will develop, produce,</i>

31:02.895 --> 31:05.598
and release a track for Zisa.

31:05.631 --> 31:07.399
See how it feels.

31:07.433 --> 31:08.567
Feel each other out.

31:08.601 --> 31:10.569
Test the waters, as it may be.

31:12.538 --> 31:14.173
This nigga done?

31:14.206 --> 31:15.608
I'm done, motherfucker.

31:15.641 --> 31:18.077
You said a single deal, right?

31:18.110 --> 31:19.378
Now, that doesn't guarantee

31:19.411 --> 31:21.547
that Zisa stays on our label
if she blows up.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.649
- Crown Camacho.
- Mh-hmm.

31:23.882 --> 31:27.386
Macho time.
You any relation to Hector?

31:27.419 --> 31:28.921
Man, me and that motherfucker, man,

31:28.954 --> 31:30.456
we done had some wild nights.

31:30.489 --> 31:33.225
This ain't got shit to do
with no Hector.

31:33.259 --> 31:36.962
Well, look, man, maybe we could
build somethin' into the deal.

31:38.063 --> 31:41.133
Certain thresholds get cleared,

31:41.166 --> 31:42.301
we'll sign to the label.

31:46.972 --> 31:48.040
Done.

31:48.073 --> 31:49.575
What the fuck?

31:51.343 --> 31:52.978
Single deal's for suckers, yo.

31:55.180 --> 31:59.051
I said... it's on.

32:21.573 --> 32:23.442
- Nah, I'm good.
- Look, I'll do two for one.

32:23.475 --> 32:25.010
Two for one.

32:25.044 --> 32:27.146
Three for one.
Come on, now. Gimme somethin'.

32:33.552 --> 32:34.720
Nigga, I moved a tape.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.156
You traded that
for a hit off a blunt.

32:39.058 --> 32:40.659
What are you boys sellin'?

32:42.227 --> 32:43.729
Just mixtapes, man.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.464
All right, the both of you,
up against the wall.

32:45.497 --> 32:47.232
What the fuck's a mixtape?

32:47.266 --> 32:49.968
It's music.
I'm a fucking rapper.

32:50.002 --> 32:51.637
Hear that? He's a rapper.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.405
Hey, what the fuck
are you doing?

32:53.439 --> 32:55.140
And what's your rap name,
rapper?

32:55.174 --> 32:57.676
- Famous.
- <i>Famous the rapper</i>

32:57.710 --> 32:59.311
is selling his mixtapes
on the corner.

32:59.345 --> 33:01.680
'Cause that's where the best
rappers sell their mixtapes.

33:02.514 --> 33:03.682
Supposed to have
a vendor's license

33:03.716 --> 33:05.484
to sell anything on the street.

33:06.318 --> 33:10.522
But seeing as you two
ain't doing much sellin',

33:10.556 --> 33:12.124
we're gonna let you slide.

33:12.157 --> 33:14.326
Good luck with your rap career, Famous.

33:29.575 --> 33:31.443
You told me
all I was gonna need to do

33:31.477 --> 33:34.313
was to sign into those classes,
then I could bounce.

33:34.346 --> 33:35.581
This broad tellin' me

33:35.614 --> 33:38.016
I gotta sit through the shit
every fuckin' week.

33:38.050 --> 33:39.651
Uh, some of the instructors

33:39.685 --> 33:41.520
are more willing to play ball
than others.

33:41.553 --> 33:43.522
This one don't give a fuck
about no ball.

33:43.555 --> 33:45.624
I tracked down your friend

33:45.657 --> 33:49.027
who was working
as an informant for the police.

33:49.061 --> 33:50.729
<i>There she is. Toni Deep.</i>

33:52.030 --> 33:55.334

a dentist out in Westchester.

33:55.367 --> 33:56.802
Ah.

33:57.035 --> 33:59.538
Your bitch does have
some nice-ass teeth.

33:59.571 --> 34:01.473
I mean, they hurt, but...

34:01.507 --> 34:03.208
she left the skin on there.

34:06.412 --> 34:07.746
She lives in Harlem.

34:07.780 --> 34:11.150
Moved back here about three
years ago from Los Angeles.

34:11.183 --> 34:13.552
Divorced twice, no kids.

34:19.124 --> 34:20.259
That's where she live?

34:24.263 --> 34:25.497
A'ight.

34:25.531 --> 34:27.566
You owe me.

34:30.769 --> 34:34.273
Well, try as I might,

34:34.306 --> 34:35.808
I don't remember shit
from that night.

34:35.841 --> 34:37.176
Nothin' at all.

34:37.209 --> 34:38.811
Yeah, and we got
nothing on our end.

34:38.844 --> 34:40.813
The blood on the jacket
we took off of Kadeem Mathis,

34:40.846 --> 34:42.548
street name Unique,

34:42.581 --> 34:43.749
didn't match you or him.

34:43.782 --> 34:45.384
<i>And believe it or not,</i>

34:45.417 --> 34:47.319
<i>his story checks out,
you know?</i>

34:47.352 --> 34:49.121
We got him on camera
at the McDonald's drive-through

34:49.154 --> 34:50.489
at the time of the shooting.

34:50.522 --> 34:51.824
We're not done with him yet.

34:51.857 --> 34:53.592
We still think he knows more
than he's letting on,

34:53.625 --> 34:56.195
but at this point, we can't
even classify him as a lead.

34:56.228 --> 34:58.697
Yeah, but we will make his life
miserable nonetheless.

34:58.730 --> 35:00.599
You know why?

35:00.632 --> 35:02.734
Because I don't need a reason.
Fuck him.

35:03.502 --> 35:05.838
Right now, all we got
is some crackhead

35:05.871 --> 35:07.639
who was high as a fucking kite

35:07.673 --> 35:09.141
who thinks he remembers
seeing a kid

35:09.174 --> 35:10.876
but can't give us
any real description.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.879
We're not giving up, though.
Not even close.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.648
We just wanted to let you know
where things stand.

35:16.682 --> 35:18.250
I appreciate that.

35:20.886 --> 35:22.588
Wish I could help, fellas.

35:23.689 --> 35:24.756
Thank you.

35:27.226 --> 35:28.527
We'll keep you posted.

35:28.560 --> 35:29.728
All right.

35:32.831 --> 35:34.533
That guy's my fuckin' hero.

35:34.566 --> 35:35.801
Yeah.

35:35.834 --> 35:39.271
A fucking NYPD Hall of Famer

35:39.304 --> 35:41.707
<i>♪ Come a little closer

35:41.740 --> 35:43.642
Hey.

35:43.675 --> 35:45.277

35:45.310 --> 35:47.412
My fault, I ain't even
see you back there.

35:47.446 --> 35:48.847
Where you been?

35:51.450 --> 35:53.218
Me and Famous had a day.

35:54.853 --> 35:56.154
It probably ain't a bad idea

35:56.188 --> 35:57.389
for you to let me know
where you are,

35:57.422 --> 36:00.158
'cause I'm your mother.

36:00.192 --> 36:01.293
I get worried.

36:02.194 --> 36:03.695
Yeah, I got it.

36:03.729 --> 36:05.497
<i>I just wanna

36:07.566 --> 36:08.700
What's wrong, Ma?

36:09.535 --> 36:10.636
It's nothin'.

36:10.669 --> 36:12.237
Somethin' is up.

36:12.271 --> 36:13.739
A'ight, I know you not just
trying to know where I'm at

36:13.772 --> 36:15.307
on some straight
motherly concern.

36:15.340 --> 36:16.542
Talk to me. What's up?

36:18.844 --> 36:20.679
Just that crazy-ass cop.

36:21.780 --> 36:23.348
Howard.

36:23.382 --> 36:24.683
Somehow, someway,

36:24.716 --> 36:26.552
his brain got all twisted up, and...

36:26.585 --> 36:28.620
he talkin'
some crazy-ass nonsense,

36:28.654 --> 36:31.256
some shit that don't even
make no sense.

36:31.290 --> 36:34.393
And it's possible that he might
step to you talkin' that shit.

36:34.426 --> 36:36.295
I just wanna
give you a heads-up.

36:36.328 --> 36:38.430
Look, now, he might not
say anything to you at all,

36:38.463 --> 36:40.832
so it's not even worth
getting into right now.

36:40.866 --> 36:42.768
But just know that if he does

36:42.801 --> 36:45.504
that it's just a crazy police
who got his head all dented.

36:45.537 --> 36:46.805
I thought you said
he didn't even remember

36:46.838 --> 36:48.340
what happened that night.

36:48.373 --> 36:50.576
Thought you said he didn't
remember my face, Ma.

36:50.609 --> 36:51.977
- What is this?
- He don't know

36:52.210 --> 36:54.246
what he remembers
or what he forgot, Kanan.

36:54.279 --> 36:55.914
You're good, baby.

36:57.249 --> 36:58.417
I got you.

37:02.287 --> 37:03.922
We good.

37:07.426 --> 37:11.263
No. What I said was
that he could stay here a night

37:11.296 --> 37:12.898
when he got out, that's all.

37:12.931 --> 37:16.468
I'm not keeping Jerome
from his daddy, Ma.

37:16.501 --> 37:18.337
A father provides.

37:18.370 --> 37:20.405
<i>A father works.</i>

37:20.439 --> 37:23.642
A father take care
of their own.

37:23.675 --> 37:25.243
What's he doing
but sitting around here

37:25.277 --> 37:26.712
taking up space,
eating my food?

37:26.745 --> 37:28.280
You know, I don't remember
you complainin'

37:28.313 --> 37:30.449
back when I was payin'
your rent,

37:30.482 --> 37:31.883
buyin' your cars, huh?

37:31.917 --> 37:34.886
Sendin' you and your broke-ass
church friends to AC

37:34.920 --> 37:36.788
every weekend, huh?

37:36.822 --> 37:38.824
But I was a provider then,
right?

37:38.857 --> 37:39.858
Right?

37:51.903 --> 37:54.272
I saw Raq today

37:54.306 --> 37:56.375
<i>at the bodega on Sutphin.</i>

37:57.709 --> 37:59.044
What Raq talkin' about?

37:59.277 --> 38:01.546
She not talkin'
about anything, 'Nique.

38:03.315 --> 38:06.485
She was just--
I mean, she just stared at me.

38:07.853 --> 38:09.821
It scared me...

38:09.855 --> 38:11.657
for all of us--
for me, you, and Jerome.

38:17.429 --> 38:19.998
Raq ain't gonna do nothin'
to us, a'ight?

38:20.032 --> 38:21.566
How do you know?

38:30.909 --> 38:32.577
Look.

38:32.611 --> 38:37.449
I can't say 100-100%
that Scrap bullshittin'...

38:38.684 --> 38:40.519
...but I checked out
his cousin in Corona,

38:40.552 --> 38:41.787
and it sure as hell
didn't sound like

38:41.820 --> 38:43.655
he was out there hangin' shit.

38:43.689 --> 38:45.090
So he lyin'.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.625
Maybe.

38:46.658 --> 38:48.060
If we ain't for sure,
we don't move on him.

38:48.093 --> 38:49.561
I got somebody on the inside

38:49.594 --> 38:51.663
who say they saw Scrap
up in the precinct talkin'.

38:51.697 --> 38:53.799
That shit alone is enough
to make the call, Lou.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.434
Then why send Marvin
to talk to him

38:55.467 --> 38:56.902
and do all that
undercover bullshit?

38:56.935 --> 38:58.570
'Cause I wanna be sure, Lou.

38:59.371 --> 39:00.539
Marvin ain't sure.

39:02.007 --> 39:03.375
Right, Marvin?

39:04.810 --> 39:07.713
Like I said,
don't put this shit on me.

39:07.746 --> 39:09.414
I told you what I told you.

39:09.448 --> 39:11.450
I won't fuck with it. Hell no.

39:11.483 --> 39:12.918
Okay, well, if the shit
is true,

39:12.951 --> 39:14.619
Scrap could put
us all away forever.

39:14.653 --> 39:18.690
Lose everything, including
your fucking precious music.

39:21.426 --> 39:22.561
Tell you one thing.

39:23.995 --> 39:25.430
I ain't doin' it.

Ain't nobody's forgotten you,

40:13.745 --> 40:15.881
We'd just rather not remember.

40:18.550 --> 40:21.086
You gonna need
some bigger soldiers, Deen.

40:21.119 --> 40:23.488
Fit this nigga in my pocket.

40:25.690 --> 40:27.526
Look, I'll hit you

40:27.559 --> 40:29.094
when I'm back up on top,

40:29.127 --> 40:30.629
which won't be long.

40:30.662 --> 40:32.197
I'm already sizin' up corners
out here.

40:32.430 --> 40:34.900
You're not a safe investment,
'Nique.

40:34.933 --> 40:37.903
Not now or anytime
in the near distant future.

40:37.936 --> 40:41.640
Look, I ain't shoot
that cop, man.

40:41.673 --> 40:43.175
That's-that's why
they let me out,

40:43.208 --> 40:44.776
'cause they ain't
got shit on me.

40:44.810 --> 40:46.578
And yet,
according to my sources,

40:46.611 --> 40:49.781
NYPD continues to consider you
a person of interest.

40:49.815 --> 40:51.082
Well, maybe
they interested in me

40:51.116 --> 40:52.851
'cause I'm an interesting
motherfucker, Deen.

40:52.884 --> 40:54.853
But I definitely
ain't pop that pig.

Raq and her Colombian supplier

41:03.461 --> 41:06.031
have cornered the market
in your old stomping grounds.

41:07.032 --> 41:09.467
There's no room
for competition--

41:09.501 --> 41:11.670
not for me or for you.

41:13.705 --> 41:15.841

if I don't win.

43:16.361 --> 43:17.996
He don't need
my help anymore anyway.

43:18.029 --> 43:19.597

he figured out
