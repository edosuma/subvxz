00:00.625 --> 00:03.420
Previously on
Walker: Independence...

00:03.461 --> 00:05.088
-(gunshot)
-ABBY: My husband was killed.

00:05.130 --> 00:06.881
Who did that? Who killed him?

00:06.923 --> 00:08.258
ABBY:
The new sheriff.

00:08.299 --> 00:10.552
Tom Davidson must be stopped.

00:10.593 --> 00:12.303
I could use someone like you
in the sheriff's office.

00:12.345 --> 00:14.639
I'm the only person who
doesn't work for Tom Davidson.

00:14.681 --> 00:16.016
You run this place for him,

00:16.057 --> 00:17.684
Abby's his clerk,
Calian's his tracker.

00:19.144 --> 00:21.396
I failed to be there
for my people.

00:21.438 --> 00:23.940
-MARTHA: What do you know
about sisters?
-ABBY: I have one, too.

00:23.982 --> 00:26.443
For most of our lives
we were best friends.

00:26.484 --> 00:28.361
We said things
we can't take back.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.989
AMOS:
Did you kill one or
two Tongs on your way out?

00:31.031 --> 00:34.075
Pay up, or I'll ride my ass
straight to San Francisco

00:34.117 --> 00:35.702
and tell them exactly
where you is.

00:35.744 --> 00:37.495
Because we are gonna
take down the Davidsons,

00:37.537 --> 00:39.581
and we are gonna set this town
straight all by ourselves,

00:39.622 --> 00:41.708
-because nobody else is
gonna help us.
-(grunts)

00:41.750 --> 00:43.168
Help me, Abby.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.630
-♪ ♪
-(horse neighs)

00:53.011 --> 00:56.014
♪ You can't stop the rain ♪

00:57.474 --> 01:00.935
-♪ It's always coming down ♪
-(grunting)

01:00.977 --> 01:03.772
Whoa. Whoa.

01:03.813 --> 01:05.607
Good morning, Manuel.

01:05.648 --> 01:08.610
-Morning, Hoyt.
-Here to pick up
for Reyes Ranch.

01:08.651 --> 01:10.820
-I got it right here for you.
-Ah.

01:10.862 --> 01:13.323
The sweet smell of manure

01:13.364 --> 01:16.117
and grain alcohol.

01:16.159 --> 01:18.244
How I've missed you,
Independence.

01:19.621 --> 01:22.832
(grunts) Anything happen
since I've been gone?

01:22.874 --> 01:25.293
-Nothing much.
-Oh, come on, Manny.

01:25.335 --> 01:27.504
Only excitement I had
the past two weeks

01:27.545 --> 01:29.130
was shooing rabbits out of

01:29.172 --> 01:30.799
-Anna Maria's vegetable garden.
-(Manuel laughs)

01:30.840 --> 01:32.300
You gotta give me something.

01:32.342 --> 01:34.260
A shootout, bank robbery.

01:34.302 --> 01:36.054
-(grunts)
-Nothing.

01:39.015 --> 01:41.768
Not even a bar fight.

01:41.810 --> 01:45.480
The sheriff should
get stabbed more often.

01:47.232 --> 01:48.983
-(door closes)
-Well, I'll be damned.

01:49.025 --> 01:50.276
It's Farmer Rawlins.

01:50.318 --> 01:51.402
How are the tomatoes
this season?

01:51.444 --> 01:52.821
Nice and juicy?

01:52.862 --> 01:55.156
It's a ranch.
We don't grow tomatoes.

01:55.198 --> 01:57.575
Not since the cutworms
got to 'em.

01:57.617 --> 01:58.910
What's all this?

01:58.952 --> 02:00.203
Still trying to nail down
the sheriff?

02:00.245 --> 02:01.454
Well, you didn't think
we'd stop

02:01.496 --> 02:03.331
just because he was gone?

02:03.373 --> 02:05.375
Why didn't you come get me?
I would've helped.

02:05.416 --> 02:07.043
We wanted to give you time,

02:07.085 --> 02:09.712
and let you settle in
at the ranch.

02:09.754 --> 02:11.464
Didn't want to interrupt
all your muckin' and hoein'.

02:11.506 --> 02:13.341
-(Abby chuckles)
-(door opens)

02:13.800 --> 02:16.427
-Shh, shh, shh.
-ABBY: Good morning, Augustus.

02:16.469 --> 02:17.762
Morning, ladies.

02:17.804 --> 02:20.890
Oh, hell no. Uh-uh.

02:20.932 --> 02:23.184
I refuse. Him and me,
we're natural enemies.

02:24.644 --> 02:27.147
-You did not tell him...
-What?

02:27.188 --> 02:28.857
That she's Abigail Collins?

02:28.898 --> 02:30.233
Well, I figured as much
when I was out

02:30.275 --> 02:31.484
at Otis's ranch.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.153
Yeah, I found it mighty odd

02:33.194 --> 02:35.321
that Abby came in town
right around the same time.

02:35.363 --> 02:38.158
And Gus kept my secret
without being asked.

02:38.199 --> 02:40.743
Calian vouched for him, Hoyt.

02:40.785 --> 02:45.206
Fine. Proceed.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.125
Well, we're still trying
to discern motive.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.294
Why would Tom be so desperate
to be sheriff he'd kill for it?

02:49.335 --> 02:51.337
HOYT:
We ought to look into those fake
Davidson companies then.

02:51.379 --> 02:52.755
GUS:
Oh, we already did.

02:52.797 --> 02:54.924
Kate and I went to
the state records office

02:54.966 --> 02:56.009
and found each one.

02:56.050 --> 02:57.677
We got ice cream.

02:57.719 --> 02:59.804
They're buying land
in the path of the railroads.

02:59.846 --> 03:02.473
Nothing points to a personal
vendetta, let alone murder.

03:02.515 --> 03:04.517
All right. Then we should
search every inch

03:04.559 --> 03:06.186
-of that sheriff's office.
-ABBY: I did.

03:06.227 --> 03:09.105
But all I found was this.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.690
-Is that Liam's journal?
-I thought so,

03:10.732 --> 03:13.026
but it's actually
Tom's sketchbook.

03:13.067 --> 03:15.278
What does that bottom-feeder
draw, anyways?

03:15.320 --> 03:16.571
Pictures of dead bodies?

03:16.613 --> 03:18.031
Flowers.

03:18.072 --> 03:21.367
It's a study of Texas
native plants.

03:21.409 --> 03:23.244
KATE:
Somehow that's spookier,
and I don't know why.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.121
GUS:
So this is everything we have?

03:25.163 --> 03:27.498
It's not exactly a smoking gun.

03:27.540 --> 03:30.210
It's too bad Tom Davidson
didn't just die.

03:38.593 --> 03:40.220
TOM:
Abby, help me, please.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.768
Here.

03:46.809 --> 03:48.353
(grunts)

03:48.394 --> 03:49.938
Somebody help!

03:49.979 --> 03:52.732
That might have been easier,

03:52.774 --> 03:54.734
but it wouldn't be justice.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.361
KATE:
Did you hear anything
from the hospital, Gus?

03:56.402 --> 03:58.655
Yeah, he's on the mend.

03:58.696 --> 04:00.281
He'll be back from Austin
in a week or two.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.867
So, what, we got nothing?

04:02.909 --> 04:05.078
Well, we don't have evidence
or motive,

04:05.119 --> 04:08.081
but we do have one thing.

04:08.122 --> 04:09.707
A witness.

04:09.749 --> 04:11.876
You're saying you want to
come forward as his wife?

04:11.918 --> 04:13.544
Abby, I've seen witnesses
get exposed.

04:13.586 --> 04:14.921
Not to put too fine
a point on it,

04:14.963 --> 04:16.172
but they end up dead.

04:16.214 --> 04:17.090
ABBY:
We just need one person

04:17.131 --> 04:18.508
outside the Davidson web.

04:18.549 --> 04:19.550
Someone with the authority
to establish

04:19.592 --> 04:21.052
a real investigation.

04:21.094 --> 04:24.681
I know a judge in Austin.
Federal, not state.

04:24.722 --> 04:26.557
My old commander from
my military days.

04:26.599 --> 04:28.017
It's-it's worth a shot.

04:28.059 --> 04:29.727
We really gonna risk Abby's life

04:29.769 --> 04:31.437
on Gus's old war buddy?

04:31.479 --> 04:33.273
We won't go
unless you feel safe.

04:34.440 --> 04:37.360
I'm ready. I'll testify.

04:45.576 --> 04:47.662

Hello, Gus.

06:00.610 --> 06:03.613
Sheriff. Hello.

06:03.654 --> 06:05.948
I'm feeling fine,
thanks for asking.

06:05.990 --> 06:09.535
I just didn't expect to
see you back so soon is all.

06:09.577 --> 06:13.039
How was it playing sheriff
with Abby as your deputy?

06:13.081 --> 06:15.416
Well, we-we do our best.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.210
The cells are empty,
almost like the town

06:17.251 --> 06:19.212
ran better while I was gone.

06:19.253 --> 06:21.964
Eh, Pax Romana.

06:22.006 --> 06:25.343
Which means you didn't
catch the man who stabbed me.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.763
Well, Sheriff, there was
no evidence, no witnesses.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.223
There was one.

06:30.264 --> 06:32.266
Well, you weren't exactly
talking, were you?

06:32.308 --> 06:33.726
(knock on door)

06:33.768 --> 06:36.938
Excuse me, I'm looking for
Sheriff Davidson.

06:36.979 --> 06:39.399
Yes, ma'am.
How can I help you?

06:39.440 --> 06:42.151
You sent a telegram about
the death of Liam Collins.

06:42.193 --> 06:44.529
Yes, I did.
It was a terrible tragedy.

06:44.570 --> 06:47.698
I'm looking for Mary, his wife.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.451
She's my sister.

06:58.292 --> 06:59.794
When we didn't hear from Mary,
we thought that she was

06:59.836 --> 07:01.462
-sick with grief.
-That's perfectly natural.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.297
But the more time passed,
the more concerned I became.

07:03.339 --> 07:05.383
She and I have been quarreling
in recent years,

07:05.425 --> 07:08.177
and I worried she might
never come home.

07:08.219 --> 07:09.429
So I got on a train.

07:09.470 --> 07:11.055
It's good that you did.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.473
You don't think that she's...

07:12.515 --> 07:14.600
Let's not get too ahead
of ourselves.

07:14.642 --> 07:17.019
I mean, she could have
made her way to another town,

07:17.061 --> 07:20.231
or she could have been
too scared to come forward.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.943
The previous sheriff didn't know
Liam was killed,

07:23.985 --> 07:25.820
so he never made
a proper search.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.864
Deputy,

07:27.905 --> 07:29.365
we owe this woman
our full attention.

07:29.407 --> 07:31.367
I was just gonna head to
the Western Union office,

07:31.409 --> 07:33.453
you know, and see if
there are any records

07:33.494 --> 07:36.330
of a telegram to or from
a Mary Collins.

07:36.372 --> 07:37.707
(door closes)

07:39.584 --> 07:41.752
Was there anyone else that knew

07:41.794 --> 07:44.005
your sister was traveling
to Texas?

07:45.882 --> 07:49.469
Miss McKenzie,
is everything all right?

07:49.510 --> 07:53.014
Yeah, just my eyes
playing tricks.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.184
Hey, Kai.

07:56.225 --> 07:59.228
Hoyt, welcome.
I have wonton soup today.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.480
Almost ready.

08:00.521 --> 08:02.148
No time for lunch, I'm afraid.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.691
Just here on ranch business.

08:03.733 --> 08:06.110
Lucia said you had some
alterations for her.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.570
-Yes. All ready to go.
-Mmm.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.155
Maybe some of these
almond cookies, too.

08:09.197 --> 08:10.573
You know, for the ladies.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.000
It is your lucky day, Kai.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.836
Someone left you
a hell of a tip.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.759
I was expecting
more of a celebration.

08:29.800 --> 08:34.388
This is, uh, fake money.
Hell money.

08:34.430 --> 08:36.516
Hell money in a red envelope
is a threat.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.853
-Someone wants me dead.
-Who?

08:43.940 --> 08:48.444
The snake oil salesman
from Founders Day.

08:48.486 --> 08:51.572
-Uh-huh.
-He knew my past
in San Francisco.

08:51.614 --> 08:55.952
There was a woman I love.

08:55.993 --> 08:57.203
Lily.

08:57.245 --> 08:58.913
I was trying to help her escape

08:58.955 --> 09:01.707
from Chinese organized crime,
the Tong.

09:01.749 --> 09:06.337
But they found her
and, uh, kill her.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.548
(exhales sharply)

09:11.342 --> 09:14.929
That is a dangerous enemy

09:14.971 --> 09:17.139
you got there.

09:17.181 --> 09:19.767
I knew a one-armed man in Omaha.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.644
Said the Tong took the other.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.271
Why let you know they're coming?

09:23.312 --> 09:27.191
Waiting is its own
form of torture.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.234
(Hoyt sighs)

09:28.276 --> 09:30.945
My father was at the Alamo.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.864
-So you're telling me
to stay and fight?
-No.

09:33.906 --> 09:36.158
Staying and fighting
might have been brave,

09:36.200 --> 09:38.327
but it also got my pa killed.

09:38.369 --> 09:40.621
So you gotta ask yourself

09:40.663 --> 09:42.331
is there anything in this world

09:42.373 --> 09:44.625
you love more than
your own life?

09:44.667 --> 09:46.586
Yes.

09:46.627 --> 09:49.880
Well, then, take it from a son

09:49.922 --> 09:51.924
who never knew his father.

09:53.217 --> 09:55.136
Run.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.932
Just be sure to let me know
where you end up.

09:59.974 --> 10:01.684
All right?

10:03.603 --> 10:07.023
-You got a horse?
-No.

10:07.064 --> 10:08.190
Say no more.

10:08.232 --> 10:10.026
One getaway horse
coming right up.

10:10.067 --> 10:11.902
Come on.

10:14.655 --> 10:16.824
You have my word that I will do
everything in my power

10:16.866 --> 10:18.242
to find your sister.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.244
In the meantime,
this is my establishment.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.246
Please make yourself at home.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.248
We got a problem.
Did Abby mention...

10:24.290 --> 10:26.751
Absolutely she did.
I've got it.

10:26.792 --> 10:29.170
-Well, Sheriff Davidson.
-Miss Carver.

10:29.211 --> 10:31.213
You know, the last time
I saw you,

10:31.255 --> 10:33.883
you were on death's door.
Look about the same.

10:33.924 --> 10:37.219
And who is this
enchanting creature?

10:37.261 --> 10:38.721
Well, we have
a distinguished guest.

10:38.763 --> 10:39.889
You've got her standing around
in the lobby

10:39.930 --> 10:41.307
like she's a common ranch hand.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.850
Darling, you deserve
somewhere to rest.

10:42.892 --> 10:44.060
I would very much like that.

10:44.101 --> 10:45.561
Yes, of course.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.188
Please see that
Miss McKenzie is put up

10:47.229 --> 10:48.397
in our finest suite.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.691
Thank you.

10:50.733 --> 10:53.402
-He's a peach. Come with me.
-Okay.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.370
Mary! You're all right.

11:02.411 --> 11:03.704
(whispers):
You're not Mary.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.289
Abigail is my middle name,

11:05.331 --> 11:07.541
and a nickname
Liam had for me.

11:07.583 --> 11:08.668
Thank God for that.

11:08.709 --> 11:09.710
You shouldn't be here, Charlie.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.295
What have you been thinking?

11:11.337 --> 11:15.257
First you leave Boston
with barely any warning.

11:15.299 --> 11:17.802
You send no news from the road,

11:17.843 --> 11:20.429
and then we get word
that Liam is dead.

11:20.471 --> 11:22.056
Murdered.

11:22.098 --> 11:23.974
What?

11:24.016 --> 11:26.977
Liam didn't just die,
he was murdered.

11:27.019 --> 11:28.270
Right in front of me.

11:28.312 --> 11:30.940
Abby was shot, too.

11:30.981 --> 11:32.316
Oh...

11:35.486 --> 11:38.447
The man who shot Liam,
who did this,

11:38.489 --> 11:41.492
is Tom Davidson, the sheriff,

11:41.534 --> 11:43.577
from whom I've been trying
to hide my identity

11:43.619 --> 11:45.079
until you arrived.

11:45.121 --> 11:46.789
How...

11:46.831 --> 11:49.333
How was I to know?

11:49.375 --> 11:51.502
Mary, you don't have to
stay here.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.087
Let me telegram Father.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.547
We can get you to safety,

11:54.588 --> 11:56.006
or he can send someone to help.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.676
No, no. Charlotte, if you really
want to help me,

11:58.718 --> 12:00.720
just stay in this room.

12:00.761 --> 12:02.680
-Kate.
-I've got her.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.223
Where are you going?

12:04.265 --> 12:05.599
To clean up your mess.

12:07.226 --> 12:08.936
TOM:
All right, folks...

12:10.813 --> 12:12.189
...most of the wagons
they traveled with...

12:12.231 --> 12:14.692
Gus, what's all this?

12:14.734 --> 12:17.695
Search party for Mary.

12:17.737 --> 12:18.863
What does Tom know?

12:18.904 --> 12:20.489
Nothing yet.

12:20.531 --> 12:22.116
Luckily your sister
didn't bring a photograph.

12:22.158 --> 12:24.535
Mm. We need to get out of here.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.287
Go to Austin, see your judge.

12:26.328 --> 12:28.330
We could leave now.

12:28.372 --> 12:30.541
-Understood?
-ALL: Yeah!

12:30.583 --> 12:32.626
Search party should distract
Tom, buy us some time.

12:32.668 --> 12:34.712
Miss Walker?

12:37.006 --> 12:38.549
Just the woman
I was looking for.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.051
Sheriff. Welcome back.

12:41.093 --> 12:43.262
You certainly made
a speedy recovery.

12:43.304 --> 12:45.473
Yes, I did.

12:45.514 --> 12:47.308
I'm sure by now you've
heard all about

12:47.349 --> 12:49.769
Liam Collins' missing wife Mary.

12:49.810 --> 12:51.395
-A bit.
-A few hunters saw

12:51.437 --> 12:52.563
the remains of
a burned-out wagon

12:52.605 --> 12:53.939
just over the ridge.

12:53.981 --> 12:55.608
Might be the spot
where it all happened.

12:55.649 --> 12:57.485
Mary's sister is
staying at Hagan's.

12:57.526 --> 12:59.069
Can you fetch her
for me, please?

12:59.111 --> 13:00.488
I want to see the scene
from her perspective.

13:00.529 --> 13:02.448
Well, there's no need
to disturb her.

13:02.490 --> 13:05.326
-It's already been
such a distressing day.
-Agreed.

13:05.367 --> 13:07.828
I can join you. I'll be
your woman's perspective.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.538
-You know what? And I'll come.
-Mm.

13:09.580 --> 13:10.915
An extra set of eyes
should help.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.708
I have a different job
for you, Gus.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.585
I should have told you
about the stabbing

13:14.627 --> 13:16.170
when it happened.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.922
It was my pride is all.

13:17.963 --> 13:20.299
No hard feelings, but he's
probably long gone...

13:20.341 --> 13:22.551
Or he might be back
to finish the job.

13:22.593 --> 13:27.181
He had a circular tattoo
on his knife hand,

13:27.223 --> 13:29.517
and one silver spur on his boot.

13:30.017 --> 13:32.520
Sheriff, that's not much
to go on.

13:32.561 --> 13:35.731
I know. But I trust
you're up for the challenge.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.656
Shall we?

13:58.462 --> 13:59.505
TOM:
Did you find anything?

13:59.547 --> 14:02.508
No, it's nothing.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.677
I see Mary played the piano.

14:04.718 --> 14:08.013
She's got a lot of books,
was an educated woman.

14:08.055 --> 14:11.475
Almost like you two are cut
from the same cloth.

14:11.517 --> 14:14.937
Clever women are far more
common than you think, Sheriff.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.526
You can see Independence
from that ridge.

14:20.568 --> 14:22.194
Think she would have
headed there?

14:22.236 --> 14:24.822
-No.
-You sure?

14:24.864 --> 14:26.866
She was probably scared
and alone.

14:26.907 --> 14:29.743
I don't think Mary
would have felt safe

14:29.785 --> 14:31.620
in a town full of strangers.

14:31.662 --> 14:33.956
Good point.

14:33.998 --> 14:37.209
After all, never know where
the killer might've went.

14:37.251 --> 14:40.713
What did Charlotte say
about her?

14:40.754 --> 14:43.090
-She was a fighter.
-Huh.

14:43.132 --> 14:46.927
Opinionated, passionate.

14:46.969 --> 14:50.639
There really doesn't seem to be
much of anything here.

14:50.681 --> 14:52.892
Should we head back to town, uh,

14:52.933 --> 14:54.727
reconvene with
the search parties?

14:54.768 --> 14:57.313
Not quite yet.

14:58.981 --> 15:02.943
There's one thing
still weighing on me.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.155
I wanted to thank you.

15:07.114 --> 15:10.409
Thank me for... for what?

15:10.451 --> 15:12.328
That night you found me
bleeding out,

15:12.369 --> 15:13.370
you saved my life.

15:13.412 --> 15:15.039
Anyone would have done the same.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.165
Not anyone.

15:16.206 --> 15:17.374
My own family didn't

15:17.416 --> 15:18.626
check on me in the hospital.

15:18.667 --> 15:22.171
They don't care
if I live or die.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.090
But you do.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.473
You're welcome.

15:34.516 --> 15:37.227
You're right,
there's nothing here.

15:38.187 --> 15:41.065
But I will find her,

15:41.106 --> 15:43.233
wherever she is.

15:43.275 --> 15:46.946
And so it turns out
Calian never shot the arrow.

15:46.987 --> 15:49.782
Francis's son set the entire
thing up to frame him.

15:49.823 --> 15:51.283
-No.
-Mm-hmm.

15:51.325 --> 15:52.618
If Abby hadn't defended him,

15:52.660 --> 15:53.994
I don't know what
he would have done.

15:54.036 --> 15:56.038
(both sigh)

15:56.080 --> 16:00.125
It's hard to reconcile that
woman with the little girl who,

16:00.167 --> 16:03.754
whose biggest act of defiance
was an unchaperoned walk.

16:03.796 --> 16:07.257
Mm. That sounds so quaint.

16:07.299 --> 16:09.885
When Abby talks about Boston,
she makes it sound like this...

16:09.927 --> 16:11.637
CHARLOTTE:
A den of cruelty and sin.

16:11.679 --> 16:12.721
Something like that, yeah.

16:12.763 --> 16:15.099
She's not wrong.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.059
Our father is an oil magnate.

16:17.101 --> 16:19.144
He built his fortune by
destroying other people's.

16:19.186 --> 16:20.521
The American way.

16:20.562 --> 16:21.563
Mary vowed that she would never

16:21.605 --> 16:23.399
take another penny from him.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.526
That's a principled stance.
It sounds like Abby.

16:27.111 --> 16:29.989
She wanted me to...

16:30.030 --> 16:33.158
renounce our father, too,

16:33.200 --> 16:35.744
but I... I couldn't.

16:35.786 --> 16:37.955
Mary and I were best friends,

16:37.997 --> 16:40.207
but that broke something
between us.

16:40.249 --> 16:42.960
I try to use our money
for good, but it's...

16:43.002 --> 16:45.045
it's cold comfort to her.

16:45.087 --> 16:47.131
Well, I can't say that I don't
know what it feels like

16:47.172 --> 16:48.340
playing both sides.

16:48.382 --> 16:51.218
Here I am working
with the sheriff.

16:51.260 --> 16:56.181
Your job sounds fascinating.

16:56.223 --> 16:57.850
(Kate laughs)

16:57.891 --> 16:59.893
You're a dancer
and you run this place.

16:59.935 --> 17:02.271
Is that why you moved
to Independence?

17:02.312 --> 17:05.190
No, no.

17:05.232 --> 17:06.525
It's not, no.

17:06.567 --> 17:09.820
I, uh, I tend to
move around a lot,

17:09.862 --> 17:12.948
and, uh, wherever I go,

17:12.990 --> 17:14.992
it seems like there's a part
for me to play,

17:15.034 --> 17:19.163
and a way that people
need to see me.

17:19.204 --> 17:24.043
Or rather that, uh,
the people want to see me.

17:24.084 --> 17:26.837
I know that dance.

17:26.879 --> 17:29.673
It's easy to lose track of
what you really desire.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.595
It is.

17:34.636 --> 17:36.388
(inhales deeply)

17:36.430 --> 17:39.058
But... (exhales sharply)
here I feel like

17:39.099 --> 17:41.268
I finally have room
to start deciding for myself.

17:41.310 --> 17:44.688
My future is as wide
as that prairie out there.

17:46.565 --> 17:49.234
No frontiers in Boston, sadly,

17:49.276 --> 17:52.112
but we make do

17:52.154 --> 17:55.824
with... discreet parlors.

17:55.866 --> 17:58.035
Charlotte McKenzie...

18:00.037 --> 18:02.331
...you are not how
your sister described.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.795
My friends call me Charlie.

18:07.836 --> 18:10.964
You two and your nicknames.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.931
(both grunting)

18:46.750 --> 18:49.002
I'm here to save your life.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.800
If you're gonna make
a quick escape,

18:54.842 --> 18:56.760
you can't be waiting around
for a stagecoach.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.138
KAI:
The Tong rely on
hand-to-hand combat.

18:59.179 --> 19:00.430
Any horse is an advantage.

19:00.472 --> 19:01.765
He ain't just any horse.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.559
Cordell there is the best
I ever knew.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.602
(whistles)

19:05.644 --> 19:08.355
Hey, Cordell, come here.
Come on, boy.

19:08.397 --> 19:09.398
God.

19:09.439 --> 19:10.566
He must've forgot what it's like

19:10.607 --> 19:14.027
to run free. Damn.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.573
Come on, Cordell.
(whistles)

19:17.614 --> 19:18.866
You can do what you want.
They can't keep you.

19:18.907 --> 19:20.159
Come on, run!

19:20.200 --> 19:21.994
(Kai clicks tongue)

19:22.494 --> 19:24.830
(clears throat)
Afternoon, Deputy.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.206
Just taking in the sights here

19:26.248 --> 19:28.458
with my good pal Kai.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.793
Well, afternoon, Kai.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.337
Would you mind giving us
a minute?

19:33.463 --> 19:35.382
Thank you.

19:36.967 --> 19:38.552
So, what?

19:38.594 --> 19:40.012
Old Molly misplace
her pocketbook?

19:40.053 --> 19:42.723
You come here
to hassle me about it?

19:42.764 --> 19:44.600
No, we got bigger problems.

19:44.641 --> 19:46.101
Abby's sister showed up,

19:46.143 --> 19:47.853
now Tom's looking for
Liam Collins' wife.

19:47.895 --> 19:50.189
-Does he know it's Abby?
-No.

19:50.230 --> 19:51.940
But he's out at the old
wagon site with her now.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.150
HOYT:
You ought to go help her.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.651
You don't think I tried?

19:54.693 --> 19:56.028
-Tom got suspicious.
-(Kai clicking tongue)

19:56.069 --> 19:57.196
All of a sudden
it's real important

19:57.237 --> 19:58.530
I find the man
who stabbed him.

19:58.572 --> 19:59.907
Going on about a tattoo
on a hand,

19:59.948 --> 20:01.450
and one silver spur.

20:01.491 --> 20:04.244
I saw a fella
at the Side Step this morning

20:04.286 --> 20:05.954
had ink on his hand.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.456
Recognized me from Fight Night.

20:07.497 --> 20:09.082
Don't you think this stabber
might have

20:09.124 --> 20:10.751
a little dirt on Tom?

20:12.252 --> 20:14.338
Fine. I'll check it out.

20:14.379 --> 20:16.924
But stick close to town.
Abby needs us.

20:19.301 --> 20:23.013
All right, Kai,
let's get you a horse.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.431
I'll be damned.

20:24.473 --> 20:26.058
(laughs)
Cordell.

20:26.099 --> 20:28.101
Hey, buddy.

20:28.143 --> 20:32.314
-You sure? You got 17.
-Hit me.

20:32.356 --> 20:35.025
-That's 21!
-You're a genius.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.360
-(gasps)
-You're a savant.

20:36.401 --> 20:37.653
We should take you on the road.

20:37.694 --> 20:39.571
KATE:
You're back early.

20:39.613 --> 20:41.114
Did you talk to the judge?

20:41.156 --> 20:43.325
No. Tom stopped Gus and I
before we could leave.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.786
He's made it his
personal life's mission

20:45.827 --> 20:47.621
to find Mary Collins.

20:47.663 --> 20:50.332
-We need a plan, fast.
-I have one.

20:50.374 --> 20:52.292
Come back to Boston with me.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.503
Father's money can
help you investigate,

20:54.544 --> 20:56.255
and Liam would want you
to be safe.

20:56.296 --> 20:57.923
You don't know what
Liam would want.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.425
Yes, I do.

21:00.467 --> 21:02.678
Even if it's easier for you
to pretend otherwise.

21:02.719 --> 21:05.013
Say, could we, could we fill in

21:05.055 --> 21:07.015
some of the blanks here?

21:08.934 --> 21:11.019
Liam and I were engaged,

21:11.061 --> 21:12.771
and he left me for Mary.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.273
And you never thought
this was pertinent to bring up?

21:14.314 --> 21:17.359
It was six months. At best.

21:17.401 --> 21:18.860
You picked a poor police officer

21:18.902 --> 21:20.362
just so you could
control him with your money.

21:20.404 --> 21:23.740
You don't know
what I wanted.

21:23.782 --> 21:27.286
You wrote me off long before
I ever even met Liam.

21:27.327 --> 21:28.745
You picked your side.

21:28.787 --> 21:30.580
Playing the obedient daughter,

21:30.622 --> 21:33.792

She was too weak, she died
of a broken heart. Something...

22:29.890 --> 22:32.017

Tom would want proof.

22:32.059 --> 22:33.435

finding this woman.

to stop him is a body.

even get one?

35:16.405 --> 35:18.491
I wouldn't know.

35:18.533 --> 35:20.326
(sighs)

35:23.496 --> 35:24.872
Ah!

35:24.914 --> 35:28.459
(screams, grunts)

35:35.216 --> 35:37.260
Before I go...

35:37.301 --> 35:40.179
a small token of my affection.

35:40.221 --> 35:42.890
It belongs with you.

35:42.932 --> 35:45.143
Thank you.

35:45.184 --> 35:46.853
When Liam proposed to me
with that ring,

35:46.894 --> 35:48.229
there was no inscription.

35:48.271 --> 35:50.857
The way he loved you,

35:50.898 --> 35:52.567
we never had anything like that.

35:55.903 --> 35:58.489
This still doesn't excuse
what I did.

35:58.531 --> 36:01.075
That wasn't you. That was...

36:01.117 --> 36:03.244
that was Mary. (sighs)

36:05.288 --> 36:08.499
Last chance to come back home.

36:08.541 --> 36:11.878
Save me from having to break the
bad news to Mother and Father.

36:16.382 --> 36:18.092
I love you...

36:20.219 --> 36:22.889
...but I have to stay.

36:22.930 --> 36:25.516
I have to find the truth.

36:26.726 --> 36:28.436
TOM:
Miss McKenzie,

36:28.477 --> 36:30.271
your coach is ready.

36:36.068 --> 36:39.739
Thank you, Sheriff.

36:39.780 --> 36:42.909
Very much appreciate
you giving my family peace.

36:50.917 --> 36:52.627
Goodbye, Abby Walker.

36:52.668 --> 36:55.046
-Very glad to have met you.
-KATE: Wait!

36:55.087 --> 36:57.840
Wait, hold on. She-she forgot
a-- It was up in the...

36:57.882 --> 36:59.675
-Hi.
-Hi.

37:05.514 --> 37:08.017
Don't be a stranger.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.936
(chuckles)

37:19.570 --> 37:22.865
♪ ♪

37:27.536 --> 37:30.706
HOYT:
I can't help but notice
you're standing with an outlaw

37:30.748 --> 37:33.125
instead of the lawman.
You switching sides?

37:33.167 --> 37:36.128
GUS:
Nope. Got a full agenda.

37:36.170 --> 37:38.005
You know, someone stole a horse

37:38.047 --> 37:40.341
from the corral
near the sheriff's office.

37:40.383 --> 37:42.134
Huh.

37:42.176 --> 37:44.595
I wouldn't know
anything about that.

37:44.637 --> 37:47.348
Too busy helping catch
dangerous criminals.

37:48.641 --> 37:49.892
Speaking of,

37:49.934 --> 37:52.770
Tom said it was the wrong guy.

37:52.812 --> 37:54.855
-Let him go.
-Really?

37:54.897 --> 37:58.150
-Mm-hmm.
-Well, that description
was spot-on.

37:58.192 --> 38:00.027
Yup. Sure was.

38:00.069 --> 38:02.154
(crowd cheering in distance)

38:02.196 --> 38:03.823
I mean, we did
all right in there.

38:05.241 --> 38:07.034
Yeah, I guess.

38:08.452 --> 38:10.663
Calian might've been right
about you.

38:13.249 --> 38:14.959
Wish I could say the same.

39:45.508 --> 39:47.927
You need allies, Calian,

39:47.968 --> 39:49.678
wherever you can find them.

39:52.223 --> 39:54.767
(chimes jingling)

40:00.898 --> 40:04.276
(horse neighs outside)

40:09.740 --> 40:12.076
Thought you two were riding off
into the sunset.

40:12.118 --> 40:14.954
I thought about what you asked.

40:14.995 --> 40:16.789
If there is anything I love

40:16.831 --> 40:19.208
more than my life.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.793
And there's not?

40:20.835 --> 40:23.254
No, there is.

40:25.798 --> 40:28.884
I love this town.

40:28.926 --> 40:31.053
-What I've built here.
-Well...

40:31.095 --> 40:34.056
Sounds like running
is not your answer.

40:34.098 --> 40:37.017
And since I have no need for a

40:37.059 --> 40:38.436
getaway horse...

40:39.770 --> 40:41.105
Yeah?

40:42.690 --> 40:44.442
Hey.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.613
Tell you what,

40:49.655 --> 40:51.532
why don't you dish up some soup,

40:51.574 --> 40:54.201
tell me about the Tong.

40:54.243 --> 40:56.412
We're gonna need a plan.

41:01.417 --> 41:03.043
Hey, bud.

41:04.837 --> 41:06.213
Howdy.

41:06.255 --> 41:07.506
Y'all got a meeting today?

41:07.548 --> 41:08.966
-I brought cookies.
-We do.

41:09.008 --> 41:10.718
We figured you'd be
with the Reyeses by now.

41:10.759 --> 41:12.595
I'm gonna...

41:12.636 --> 41:14.221
run free for a little bit,

41:14.263 --> 41:15.931
-I think.
-What about Lucia?

41:15.973 --> 41:17.850
HOYT:
Look, she knows
I gave it a fair try,

41:17.892 --> 41:19.685
but if I drove
another fence post,

41:19.727 --> 41:21.520
-I was gonna drive us both mad.
-Very mature of you, Hoyt.

41:21.562 --> 41:25.274
Rawlins. Well, I didn't expect
to be seeing you so soon.

41:25.316 --> 41:27.359
He quit. You owe me two bits.

41:27.401 --> 41:29.069
The hell?

41:29.111 --> 41:31.155
I'm trying to be a better man,
y'all are taking bets.

41:31.197 --> 41:32.865
Pay up, Deputy.

41:32.907 --> 41:34.950
Thank you.

41:34.992 --> 41:36.660
Abby?

41:36.702 --> 41:38.078
What's wrong?

41:38.120 --> 41:39.830
I... I need to talk to you

41:39.872 --> 41:41.832
about something
that happened yesterday.

41:41.874 --> 41:44.251
Abby, what's going on?

41:44.293 --> 41:46.754
Well, um...

41:48.297 --> 41:51.842
I'm not sure Tom is the killer.
