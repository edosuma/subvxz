ELEMENTARY #711
"Unfriended"
Closed Captioned

00:01.126 --> 00:04.379
Previously on Elementary...
What just happened?

00:07.007 --> 00:09.301
Sorry about that.
How’d you do it?

00:09.301 --> 00:12.137
Whatever it is, I’m sure it was
trademarked Odker technology...

00:12.137 --> 00:14.681
I would trademark it if I wanted
anyone to know I had it.

00:14.681 --> 00:17.851
So this is a dossier on someone
you have marked for execution.

00:17.851 --> 00:21.063
It’s one last attempt to see
if we could all work together.

00:21.063 --> 00:22.648
Do your own research.

00:22.648 --> 00:24.399
Is it better
to eliminate Conrad

00:24.399 --> 00:27.236
or risk him killing
dozens of people?

00:27.236 --> 00:28.987
There was indeed a gun show
in Vermont on the weekend

00:28.987 --> 00:30.280
of Wesley Conrad’s visit.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.032
So he could’ve bought a gun.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.534
Wesley Conrad?

00:33.534 --> 00:35.285
Might I have a word?

00:35.285 --> 00:37.371
What is it?
It’s a gun.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.790
Recently procured
by Wesley Conrad.

00:39.790 --> 00:41.291
He could have more guns.

00:41.291 --> 00:43.043
I put him in touch
with a law firm

00:43.043 --> 00:44.878
who are going to help him
resolve his grievances

00:44.878 --> 00:45.963
without violence.

00:45.963 --> 00:49.258
Odin Reichenbach
wants to see us.

00:49.258 --> 00:51.635
Wesley Conrad killed himself
this afternoon.

00:51.635 --> 00:54.137
Right after he murdered
both his parents.

00:59.685 --> 01:01.937
(elevator bell dings)

01:01.937 --> 01:05.023
The detectives at
the 6-4 let me sit in

01:05.023 --> 01:07.568
while they interviewed
Wesley Conrad’s sister.

01:07.568 --> 01:10.988
She said there was some tension
between Wesley and his parents,

01:10.988 --> 01:12.948
but just the usual
stuff you would expect

01:12.948 --> 01:14.950
when an adult son moves
back into the house:

01:14.950 --> 01:17.119
his share of the bills, how long
he was gonna stay, small stuff.

01:17.119 --> 01:20.330
Nothing that would suggest this.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.249
I know you’re angry.

01:22.249 --> 01:23.792
I am, too, but we
can’t blame ourselves.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.335
Stopping Wesley

01:25.335 --> 01:26.712
from shooting up the theater
your way

01:26.712 --> 01:28.171
was the right thing to do.

01:28.171 --> 01:31.466
That’s not what I’m angry about.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.512
Is this the Conrads’ house?

01:35.512 --> 01:36.805
It’s from
this morning.

01:36.805 --> 01:38.724
I told you
I had eyes on them.

01:38.724 --> 01:40.809
Secretly planted
several webcams

01:40.809 --> 01:42.894
when I visited their house.
Keep watching.

01:47.858 --> 01:49.943
That’s the same thing that
happened to our phones

01:49.943 --> 01:52.237
and computers
right before Odin showed up.

01:52.237 --> 01:54.990
Something happened there
that he didn’t want us to see.

01:54.990 --> 01:56.867
Wesley didn’t
kill himself

01:56.867 --> 01:59.536
and his parents, Odin sent
people there to kill them,

01:59.536 --> 02:00.746
and then they staged
it to make it look

02:00.746 --> 02:02.247
like a murder-suicide.

02:02.247 --> 02:03.915
When his signal-jamming
technology

02:03.915 --> 02:05.250
took out
the Conrads’ electronics,

02:05.250 --> 02:06.460
it also unwittingly

02:06.460 --> 02:08.920
took out mine.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.839
Handed us his calling card.

02:10.839 --> 02:14.343
How is this saving lives?

02:14.343 --> 02:18.263
Well, perhaps he wanted
to falsely prove his thesis.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.390
Convince us
that his program

02:20.390 --> 02:23.477
of organized vigilantism
is not only justified,

02:23.477 --> 02:26.104
but the only way,
and that we were wrong

02:26.104 --> 02:28.315
to try and stop Wesley
without violence.

02:28.315 --> 02:31.276
You think he still wants us
to join his team.

02:31.276 --> 02:35.864
Or at least just live
and let live.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.616
Yeah, well, he blew that.

02:37.616 --> 02:40.827
(phone chimes)

02:40.827 --> 02:42.329
Hmm.

02:42.329 --> 02:44.039
What is it?

02:44.039 --> 02:45.707
I told you that,
several weeks ago,

02:45.707 --> 02:47.959
I reached out to several
possible sources of help.

02:47.959 --> 02:49.503
Well,

02:49.503 --> 02:52.672
one of those sources
has finally decided to respond.

03:03.141 --> 03:05.811
Father.

03:05.811 --> 03:08.063
Hello, son.

03:08.063 --> 03:09.606
Joan.

03:09.606 --> 03:12.150
It’s always good
to see you.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.403
I apologize
for not coming earlier,

03:14.403 --> 03:15.779
but I assure you,
I’ve given

03:15.779 --> 03:17.030
a great measure of thought

03:17.030 --> 03:19.449
to your Odin Reichenbach
problem.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.243
I take it, from your arrival,
you think you can help?

03:21.243 --> 03:23.662
I do. After all,

03:23.662 --> 03:26.289
dismantling
global criminal enterprises

03:26.289 --> 03:28.125
is an area in which
I have some expertise.

03:31.420 --> 03:33.255
Shall we attack it together?

04:09.541 --> 04:11.376
Parker Landis,

04:11.376 --> 04:13.795
who was planning a mass botulism
poisoning in Phoenix

04:13.795 --> 04:16.715
when he was gunned down
in a seeming act of road rage.

04:16.715 --> 04:19.134
He’s the last of Odin’s
sanctions that we were aware of,

04:19.134 --> 04:21.178
apart from Wesley Conrad,
of course.

04:21.178 --> 04:25.724
And you’ve been unsuccessful in
connecting Odin to any of these?

04:25.724 --> 04:27.768
He’s insulated himself too well.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.145
Covered his tracks
as skillfully as we would expect

04:30.145 --> 04:31.980
the head of a global
Internet platform.

04:31.980 --> 04:34.608
As far as we know, the people
committing the murders

04:34.608 --> 04:37.402
don’t know that he’s the one
giving the orders.

04:37.402 --> 04:40.447
And even if they did,
if Patrick Meers is any example,

04:40.447 --> 04:42.157
they won’t talk.

04:42.157 --> 04:44.326
Do we have any reason
to expect greater success

04:44.326 --> 04:45.869
connecting him to this one,

04:45.869 --> 04:48.747
this, uh, Wesley Conrad
and his parents?

04:48.747 --> 04:50.749
I’ve been to the crime scene,
I examined everything.

04:50.749 --> 04:52.751
It was the work of
professionals, it was perfect.

04:52.751 --> 04:55.629
I expect it to be harder
to connect to him, not easier.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.380
Hmm.
WATSON: Even if
we had a murder

04:57.380 --> 05:00.091
to pin on him, we don’t know
who to bring it to.

05:00.091 --> 05:01.384
Odin has implied
that he has friends

05:01.384 --> 05:03.887
in almost every law enforcement
agency in the world.

05:03.887 --> 05:05.430
We don’t know which
organizations to trust.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.432
Or how high his reach

05:07.432 --> 05:08.892
in any one
of them goes.

05:08.892 --> 05:11.186
Luckily, that’s where
I believe I can help.

05:11.186 --> 05:14.272
Reichenbach isn’t the only one
with friends in high places.

05:14.272 --> 05:15.857
I’d venture to
say that mine

05:15.857 --> 05:18.985
are higher up
the mountaintop than his.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.445
You think you can
make him vulnerable

05:20.445 --> 05:22.239
to a criminal charge?
Perhaps.

05:22.239 --> 05:24.032
Although, it’ll be
a pointless exercise

05:24.032 --> 05:26.826
unless we have a murder
to charge him with when I do.

05:26.826 --> 05:28.286
HOLMES: As it happens,
I’ve been contemplating

05:28.286 --> 05:29.496
a new way to identify one.

05:29.496 --> 05:30.914
Not without risk.

05:30.914 --> 05:32.290
But I think we agree

05:32.290 --> 05:33.667
it’s time we
took some.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.296
ANTONIA: Now
a good time?

05:38.296 --> 05:40.590
You asked me to keep you updated

05:40.590 --> 05:42.259
on the Wesley Conrad
investigation.

05:42.259 --> 05:43.802
And?

05:43.802 --> 05:45.470
Fair winds or foul?

05:45.470 --> 05:47.013
Everything’s good.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.765
Our man
at the 64th precinct said

05:48.765 --> 05:50.016
the investigation’s
running smoothly.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.519
CSU found nothing
to suggest

05:52.519 --> 05:54.312
that our people were ever there.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.523
This should close
a murder-suicide

05:56.523 --> 05:58.066
without a hitch.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.693
And our other friends?

05:59.693 --> 06:01.778
Any lingering doubts?

06:01.778 --> 06:03.780
Joan Watson accompanied
the detectives

06:03.780 --> 06:05.156
when they interviewed
the sister.

06:05.156 --> 06:06.366
I am told she
seemed satisfied.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.034
They’ve been
quiet since.

06:08.034 --> 06:10.745
That’s good.
But there’s something else?

06:10.745 --> 06:12.038
New business.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.582
Urgent?
It jumped

06:13.582 --> 06:15.458
to the head of the
line pretty fast.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.460
Name’s Stewart Pringle.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.754
Lives here in New York.

06:19.754 --> 06:22.132
He’s been writing furious posts
about how his girlfriend

06:22.132 --> 06:24.968
OD’d last night on
prescription opioids.

06:24.968 --> 06:26.344
Says he blames the
drug manufacturer,

06:26.344 --> 06:28.388
and he’s gonna make them pay.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.223
Their offices are
in Sunset Park.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.726
Mention a timeline?
No.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.394
But he’s already surfing for
tips on homemade explosives.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.937
This one’s moving quickly.

06:35.937 --> 06:37.647
Then we should
move quickly, too.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.029
SALESMAN:
I’ll need to see some ID

06:44.029 --> 06:45.697
with the credit
card, Mr. Pringle.

06:45.697 --> 06:47.657
Sure thing.

06:53.622 --> 06:53.997
SALESMAN:
You, uh,

06:53.997 --> 06:55.624
you a hunter, Mr. Pringle?

06:55.624 --> 06:56.791
How’d you know?

06:56.791 --> 06:59.169
I saw your gear.

06:59.169 --> 07:01.421
Yeah, I got a cabin upstate.

07:02.505 --> 07:04.049
Propane’s to heat it.

07:04.049 --> 07:05.800
Well, you be careful
driving back up there.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.093
And make sure you point
that rifle away

07:07.093 --> 07:08.386
from the tank when you shoot.

07:08.386 --> 07:09.804
Bullet hits it,

07:09.804 --> 07:12.015
maybe you don’t have a cabin
upstate anymore.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.492
HOLMES:
Wilson Kubiak, Joan Watson.

07:30.492 --> 07:33.703
Mr. Kubiak works for a global
security firm my father employs.

07:33.703 --> 07:36.122
So you said that Stewart Pringle
is one of your

07:36.122 --> 07:37.916
online identities?

07:37.916 --> 07:39.918
I’ve been spewing alarming
rants on social networking

07:39.918 --> 07:41.961
in Pringle’s name
since last night.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.546
And now, if anyone wants
to confirm it,

07:43.546 --> 07:45.632
Stewart Pringle
really bought a rifle,

07:45.632 --> 07:47.133
a propane tank
and the makings

07:47.133 --> 07:48.927
of a pipe bomb.
WATSON:
The idea is,

07:48.927 --> 07:50.929
he plans to strap the pipe bomb
to the tank.

07:50.929 --> 07:53.306
Makes a big boom, lots of fire,

07:53.306 --> 07:55.058
and as people evacuate
the building,

07:55.058 --> 07:57.102
Stewart picks them off
with the rifle.

07:57.102 --> 07:58.561
A tad overkill,
perhaps.

07:58.561 --> 08:00.271
But the idea was
to grab Odin’s attention.

08:00.271 --> 08:02.982
So now we wait,
and hope that Odin

08:02.982 --> 08:04.818
sends someone
to kill him?
It shouldn’t be too long,

08:04.818 --> 08:07.070
given how imminent I’ve
made the attack seem.

08:07.070 --> 08:08.363
I chose this particular identity

08:08.363 --> 08:10.240
to reduce the variables
as to where

08:10.240 --> 08:11.658
Odin’s vigilante
might strike.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.576
Pringle is ostensibly
a virtual shut-in

08:13.576 --> 08:15.078
who works from home.

08:15.078 --> 08:16.621
WATSON: Home
being the address

08:16.621 --> 08:18.373
associated with the license
and credit card.

08:18.373 --> 08:19.999
It’s a safe house I maintain,

08:19.999 --> 08:21.334
which is already
being surveilled

08:21.334 --> 08:23.586
by Wilson’s
associates.

08:23.586 --> 08:25.338
My father, meanwhile, should be
meeting with one of his

08:25.338 --> 08:27.424
fellow overlords
right now.

08:27.424 --> 08:29.467
Personally, I’d rather risk
bouncing around in traffic

08:29.467 --> 08:31.928
with an enormous tank
of propane.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.602
TSENG:
Morland.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.855
It’s been far too long.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.023
Oh, Mrs. Tseng.
(chuckles)

08:44.023 --> 08:45.817
Mm.

08:45.817 --> 08:48.653
Thank you for seeing me
at such short notice.

08:48.653 --> 08:51.698
You seem absolutely
in your element here.

08:51.698 --> 08:54.451
More soothing than the
penthouse in the city, yes?

08:54.451 --> 08:59.581
Are you reminding me that you
helped me acquire this property?

08:59.581 --> 09:02.792
Did I? Ah.
(chuckles)

09:02.792 --> 09:04.669
Ah, yes, I recall

09:04.669 --> 09:08.089
that the previous owner
needed some cajoling.

09:08.089 --> 09:10.759
How are your children?

09:10.759 --> 09:13.178
The Party has been generous.

09:13.178 --> 09:16.890
They are well-placed,
and have good lives.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.768
And your son?

09:19.768 --> 09:24.355
The matter I’m here to
discuss pertains to him.

09:24.355 --> 09:28.109
And I want to stress that
this request is not selfish.

09:28.109 --> 09:31.237
I’ll be visiting a number
of our friends today,

09:31.237 --> 09:35.408
and the favor I’ll be asking,
I believe, will benefit us all

09:35.408 --> 09:37.327
in the long run.

09:37.327 --> 09:40.830
Those of us who have enjoyed
a certain level of influence.

09:40.830 --> 09:44.751
You believe that influence
is being threatened?

09:44.751 --> 09:46.961
I do.

09:46.961 --> 09:49.422
Then I am eager to help.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.965
Are you familiar
with the name

09:50.965 --> 09:53.843
Odin Reichenbach?

09:57.555 --> 09:59.891
(door opens)

10:13.363 --> 10:15.698
(door closes)

10:20.954 --> 10:23.665
"Annie Spellman"?

10:23.665 --> 10:25.542
Third grade teacher.

10:33.925 --> 10:35.760
(exhales sharply)

10:37.262 --> 10:38.805
Let’s lose the restraints.

10:47.021 --> 10:48.606
These men caught you
breaking in here.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.484
Are you cops?

10:51.484 --> 10:53.862
I’m a detective.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.990
These men are...

10:56.990 --> 10:58.157
private security.

10:59.868 --> 11:01.160
Are you gonna kill me?

11:01.160 --> 11:02.579
No.

11:04.789 --> 11:07.166
So this is kidnapping?

11:07.166 --> 11:08.167
Yeah.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.254
But don’t get any ideas about

11:11.254 --> 11:15.133
reporting your abduction
to the authorities.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.759
How are you gonna explain
how our paths crossed?

11:18.845 --> 11:21.514
You came in here
with a loaded weapon

11:21.514 --> 11:23.892
expressly to murder
Stewart Pringle.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.478
There’s no point
in denying it.

11:27.478 --> 11:31.190
I know this because
I invented Stewart Pringle.

11:31.190 --> 11:34.193
I used his identity
to lure you here.

11:34.193 --> 11:36.237
Well, not you personally.

11:36.237 --> 11:37.864
But someone like you.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.409
My interest

11:41.409 --> 11:43.828
is in who sent you here.

11:43.828 --> 11:45.872
How they approached you

11:45.872 --> 11:47.540
and how they communicate
with you.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.502
I’m not going
to tell you anything.

11:51.502 --> 11:53.630
(chuckles)

11:53.630 --> 11:55.715
You misunderstand me.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.550
While I would welcome
any information

11:57.550 --> 11:59.052
you want to volunteer,

11:59.052 --> 12:01.179
I don’t expect any.

12:01.179 --> 12:03.765
We’re just holding you here
while my partner

12:03.765 --> 12:06.684
searches your home.

12:06.684 --> 12:08.978
She’s very good, so...

12:11.439 --> 12:13.858
I expect we’ll find all
the answers we need on our own.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.366
I was briefed
on the first vigilante

12:21.366 --> 12:23.201
you guys came across--
Patrick Meers?

12:23.201 --> 12:24.535
He was a combat
vet, right?

12:24.535 --> 12:26.037
Had some trouble
when he came back?

12:26.037 --> 12:27.497
Guy like that being
recruited for this work

12:27.497 --> 12:29.290
makes more sense to
me than a teacher.

12:29.290 --> 12:32.043
I think I might understand it.

12:32.043 --> 12:33.670
I recognize the name
of the school;

12:33.670 --> 12:36.589
there was a shooting there
about eight months ago.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.174
Could be it left her open
to Odin’s ideas.

12:43.346 --> 12:44.389
This is weird.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.268
These are from
TheSwagMachine.com.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.729
It’s an online print shop.

12:51.729 --> 12:52.981
They make custom
t-shirts and coffee mugs.

12:52.981 --> 12:54.482
These are all identical.

12:54.482 --> 12:56.275
Maybe she likes
to give them out as gifts.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.902
Maybe. Or they might be
for something else.

12:57.902 --> 13:00.279
Did you notice
a computer anywhere?

13:06.995 --> 13:09.956
WATSON: This is the website
the pot holders came from.

13:09.956 --> 13:12.000
You can see the date
she ordered each of them.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.043
Now, there’s another order
waiting in her cart.

13:14.043 --> 13:17.338
Look whose name
is in the shipping info.

13:17.338 --> 13:18.798
Stewart Pringle.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.008
And that’s the address

13:20.008 --> 13:21.384
for your partner’s safe house.

13:21.384 --> 13:23.219
"Plans to bomb a building today.

13:23.219 --> 13:24.846
Must be stopped ASAP."

13:24.846 --> 13:27.056
So, when I went to
Patrick Meers’ house,

13:27.056 --> 13:29.767
I saw that Odin or his
people were communicating

13:29.767 --> 13:31.978
with him
in a video game chat room.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.813
On my way over here,

13:33.813 --> 13:35.648
I was thinking that Annie
probably had a way

13:35.648 --> 13:37.442
to exchange messages
online, too.

13:37.442 --> 13:38.860
So when I saw
the potholders

13:38.860 --> 13:40.570
came from a website...
You thought that
might be it.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.030
Looks like you were right.

13:42.030 --> 13:44.449
So someone on
Odin’s side

13:44.449 --> 13:45.992
has access to this account.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.327
They send instructions
by leaving an order in the cart.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.246
The target
is the name and address

13:50.246 --> 13:51.873
in the shipping info.

13:51.873 --> 13:53.916
And I’m guessing the way
that Annie confirms

13:53.916 --> 13:56.669
she’s done the job
is by changing the shipping info

13:56.669 --> 13:58.671
to her own and then
completing the order.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.548
Well, if you’re right,
three potholders means

14:00.548 --> 14:02.050
she’s already done three hits.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.760
On those dates.

14:05.762 --> 14:08.389
Also, I think I might have
found where she keeps her gun.

14:10.892 --> 14:12.602
Unfortunately, the names

14:12.602 --> 14:14.103
of the other people
she’s killed

14:14.103 --> 14:15.605
have already been erased.

14:15.605 --> 14:16.981
Maybe we can figure
them out from the dates?

14:20.693 --> 14:22.528
(latch clicks)

14:25.364 --> 14:27.325
What do you think this stuff is?

14:27.325 --> 14:29.202
Blue paint?

14:29.202 --> 14:30.703
(sniffs)

14:30.703 --> 14:32.789
Actually...

14:32.789 --> 14:35.666
this is gonna sound weird,
but I’m pretty sure it’s blood.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.543
And if I’m right...

14:37.543 --> 14:40.213
I also know who
one of Annie’s victims was.

14:46.302 --> 14:47.720
(footsteps approaching)

14:53.434 --> 14:56.229
(exhales)

14:56.229 --> 14:58.106
(sharp exhale) You haven’t
touched your dinner.

15:00.108 --> 15:02.443
You don’t think it’s
poisoned, do you?

15:09.575 --> 15:11.035
What do you want?

15:15.414 --> 15:17.458
My partner’s visit to
your home was a success.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.335
Sort of.

15:19.335 --> 15:21.379
We still don’t know
who sent you,

15:21.379 --> 15:23.381
but we do know the name
of one of your victims.

15:23.381 --> 15:24.674
Talia Baccaro.

15:24.674 --> 15:26.509
She was a scientist.

15:26.509 --> 15:27.927
You shot her to
death outside her lab

15:27.927 --> 15:30.429
several months ago.

15:30.429 --> 15:31.931
Sorry.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.307
I’ve never seen
that woman before.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.103
Well, perhaps this will
refresh your memory.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.358
The gloves you were wearing
when you pulled the trigger.

15:42.358 --> 15:43.860
This residue, it’s blood.

15:46.112 --> 15:47.947
It’s blue.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.824
Well, it’s not
human blood.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.202
It’s the blood
of a horseshoe crab.

15:53.202 --> 15:55.246
Unlike our blood,
which is oxygenated by iron,

15:55.246 --> 15:57.165
theirs is oxygenated by copper.

15:57.165 --> 15:59.584
And the result is the shade
of blue that you see here.

15:59.584 --> 16:01.627
The lab founded by Miss Baccaro

16:01.627 --> 16:03.296
collects and
processes the stuff.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.298
Why? Because it is
the only known source

16:05.298 --> 16:07.466
of an extract used to test
for bacterial contamination

16:07.466 --> 16:09.677
in the manufacture of every

16:09.677 --> 16:11.304
injectable medicine
on the planet.
That’s fascinating.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.639
You should come talk
to my class some day.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.474
Well, actually, it’s my
partner who should visit,

16:15.474 --> 16:17.268
because she’s the
one who read about

16:17.268 --> 16:19.353
Miss Baccaro’s
murder in the news

16:19.353 --> 16:21.647
and she’s the one who noted
the blood’s coppery scent

16:21.647 --> 16:24.609
and identified it.

16:24.609 --> 16:26.152
What happened?

16:26.152 --> 16:29.113
Was she transporting
some when you shot her

16:29.113 --> 16:30.740
and it splashed
on you, or...?

16:35.453 --> 16:37.288
If you don’t want to
talk about her murder,

16:37.288 --> 16:39.874
we can talk about one of
the others you committed.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.503
We know they were
assigned to you

16:44.503 --> 16:45.880
through a
SwagMachine account

16:45.880 --> 16:48.591
you shared with
your handler.

16:48.591 --> 16:51.969
We also know that your gun
is registered in your name.

16:51.969 --> 16:54.263
When it finds its
way to the police,

16:54.263 --> 16:56.349
how long do you think
it will be before

16:56.349 --> 16:58.851
they connect it to the bullets
which killed Miss Baccaro?

17:04.273 --> 17:07.401
Look...

17:07.401 --> 17:10.529
I’ll confess, you
don’t strike me

17:10.529 --> 17:12.865
as the kind of person who’d be
readily converted to murder.

17:15.576 --> 17:17.203
I have to believe
that, at some point,

17:17.203 --> 17:19.455
you met your recruiter
face-to-face.

17:19.455 --> 17:22.583
And they enlisted
you with some...

17:22.583 --> 17:24.919
personal appeal.

17:28.089 --> 17:30.258
So, you give me
their name...

17:30.258 --> 17:31.884
and I give you my word...

17:34.887 --> 17:36.514
I’ll help you.

17:56.784 --> 17:59.620
Paying quid pro quo
to a certain hacker collective?

17:59.620 --> 18:02.707
I asked for their help.
This was their price.

18:02.707 --> 18:04.083
Apparently, a bunch of them find

18:04.083 --> 18:07.628
the crinkling sound
invigorating.

18:07.628 --> 18:10.298
I checked it out online.

18:10.298 --> 18:11.924
People swear
it isn’t sexual, but...

18:11.924 --> 18:14.427
Such things can enter
a gray area.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.721
Anyway,

18:16.721 --> 18:19.932
I received an update
from my father.

18:19.932 --> 18:23.144
His plan to declaw Odin
Reichenbach proceeds apace.

18:23.144 --> 18:24.895
And Annie Spellman,
how did she react

18:24.895 --> 18:26.355
when you told her
what we know?

18:26.355 --> 18:28.190
Now that she’s over
the initial shock of rendition,

18:28.190 --> 18:30.234
she’s displaying some
surprising backbone.

18:30.234 --> 18:33.321
Obviously, you haven’t dealt
with any third grade teachers.

18:33.321 --> 18:34.572
Any luck at identifying
her other victims?

18:34.572 --> 18:35.948
Well, I sent the other two dates

18:35.948 --> 18:37.783
we got off SwagMachine
to Marcus.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.785
Obviously, I was vague
about why we were interested.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.746
He’s pulling anything
he can find about murders

18:41.746 --> 18:43.581
on or just before those dates.

18:43.581 --> 18:46.417
I asked Everyone to scour
SwagMachine servers.

18:46.417 --> 18:47.918
I thought maybe they could
recover the victims’ names

18:47.918 --> 18:50.129
from the deleted
shipping info.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.797
Or dig up the IP address

18:51.797 --> 18:54.133
of whoever sent Annie
those assignments.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.844
Hence the demand for your
titillating tissue etude.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.929
Yeah, well, they didn’t
find anything.

18:58.929 --> 19:00.473
But that wasn’t my only request.

19:00.473 --> 19:01.807
I also asked them to dig into

19:01.807 --> 19:04.101
Talia Baccaro’s online activity.

19:04.101 --> 19:05.770
Something must have put her
on Odin’s radar

19:05.770 --> 19:07.605
as a killer in the making.

19:07.605 --> 19:09.857
Well, that’s the thing.
Nothing in her life suggests

19:09.857 --> 19:11.108
that she was planning
to hurt anyone.

19:11.108 --> 19:13.486
No angry rants,
no alarming purchases.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.529
As far as everyone could tell,

19:15.529 --> 19:17.698
Talia Baccaro should have
never drawn Odin’s attention

19:17.698 --> 19:20.034
in the first place.
The man has corrupted
myriad branches

19:20.034 --> 19:21.660
of intelligence
and law enforcement.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.621
Perhaps she had
an in-person meeting

19:23.621 --> 19:25.122
with one of his moles,
and something she said...

19:25.122 --> 19:27.041
threw up a red flag.

19:27.041 --> 19:29.293
Maybe. If you’re right,
that might lead us to someone

19:29.293 --> 19:31.003
who can connect us to him.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.963
Put your tissues away, Watson.

19:32.963 --> 19:34.507
It’s time to leave
the digital realm

19:34.507 --> 19:36.842
and investigate Talia Baccaro
in the real world.

19:40.721 --> 19:43.349
You said you’re already pretty
familiar with what we do here?

19:43.349 --> 19:47.353
Yes. Wantagh Labs is
the primary supplier

19:47.353 --> 19:50.064
of limulus amebocyte lysate,
or L.A.L.,

19:50.064 --> 19:51.899
east of the Mississippi.

19:51.899 --> 19:53.317
It’s the protein
in the crabs’ blood

19:53.317 --> 19:54.735
that detects contamination.

19:54.735 --> 19:56.862
Every biotech
and pharmaceutical company

19:56.862 --> 19:59.657
in existence uses L.A.L.
to test their products.

19:59.657 --> 20:02.118
A quart of this stuff
sells for $15,000.

20:02.118 --> 20:04.328
I’m sure the crabs are
very happy for you.

20:04.328 --> 20:07.081
I know it looks gruesome, but
I promise, we don’t kill them.

20:07.081 --> 20:08.582
We take a safe amount
of their blood,

20:08.582 --> 20:10.167
and then return them
to the ocean.

20:10.167 --> 20:12.628
When Talia founded this place,
she was adamant about

20:12.628 --> 20:15.548
treating them as
humanely as possible.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.258
This was Talia’s desk.

20:17.258 --> 20:19.093
Everything is pretty much
where she left it.

20:19.093 --> 20:21.262
It’s not quite a shrine,
but it’s close.

20:21.262 --> 20:23.055
We figure her family will

20:23.055 --> 20:24.515
come get her things
when they’re ready.

20:24.515 --> 20:27.226
Talia was killed
by a mugger, right?

20:27.226 --> 20:29.520
Sorry, it’s just,

20:29.520 --> 20:31.147
I’m not sure what
you would find here

20:31.147 --> 20:33.190
that would point you
to the person who did it.

20:33.190 --> 20:35.067
We have reason to believe
there’s more to the story.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.069
Seriously?
Would you help me
get onto her computer?

20:37.069 --> 20:39.947
Yeah, sure.

20:39.947 --> 20:43.325
So, how did Talia seem in
the days before her death?

20:43.325 --> 20:45.327
Uh, happy, I guess.

20:45.327 --> 20:47.913
She was a happy person.

20:47.913 --> 20:50.833
She wasn’t having
any problems with anyone?

20:50.833 --> 20:53.586
COWORKER:
Not that I’m aware of.

20:53.586 --> 20:54.920
And she hadn’t made any
threats against anyone?

20:54.920 --> 20:56.297
Threats?

20:56.297 --> 20:59.091
(chuckles)
No. Absolutely not. Why?

20:59.091 --> 21:01.010
HOLMES: According
to her calendar,

21:01.010 --> 21:04.472
she met with a nonprofit
organization, Heal the Wild,

21:04.472 --> 21:05.973
just a few days before she died.

21:05.973 --> 21:07.683
The conservationist group?

21:07.683 --> 21:10.895
What we do here,
even though it helps save lives,

21:10.895 --> 21:13.439
it’s controversial.
Horseshoe crabs are endangered,

21:13.439 --> 21:15.191
and Heal the Wild
thinks labs like ours

21:15.191 --> 21:17.318
are contributing to the decline
in the population.

21:17.318 --> 21:20.529
Talia gave a tour to some
of the group members that day.

21:20.529 --> 21:23.073
She wanted them to see
that we were doing everything

21:23.073 --> 21:24.116
the right way.
How’d it go?

21:24.116 --> 21:26.035
Good, I think.

21:26.035 --> 21:28.037
No one threw
blue blood on us or anything.

21:28.037 --> 21:29.205
HOLMES:
Still, odd to invite

21:29.205 --> 21:30.873
their scrutiny, no?

21:30.873 --> 21:32.917
Would I have brought them here?

21:32.917 --> 21:35.044
No. But that
was Talia.

21:35.044 --> 21:37.546
She wanted to open a dialogue
with them, so she did.

21:37.546 --> 21:40.299
So are you saying
they were in regular contact?

21:40.299 --> 21:41.926
Only for a few weeks.

21:41.926 --> 21:43.511
If she was thinking
about making any changes

21:43.511 --> 21:44.803
based on the talks,

21:44.803 --> 21:46.639
she died before

21:46.639 --> 21:49.266
she had a chance
to implement them.

21:49.266 --> 21:51.352
I’ve got an appointment with
our distributor, but please,

21:51.352 --> 21:52.728
stay as long as you need.

21:52.728 --> 21:53.687
Thanks.

21:56.273 --> 21:57.525
We’ve been trying
and failing

21:57.525 --> 21:59.068
to come up with
a reason why Odin

21:59.068 --> 22:00.986
would’ve seen Talia as a threat
to innocent lives.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.988
What if Heal the Wild
had won her over?

22:02.988 --> 22:06.951
If they had, and she had plans
to sabotage her own lab,

22:06.951 --> 22:09.245
the disruption
in the supply of L.A.L.

22:09.245 --> 22:10.579
would crippled the country’s
supply of everything

22:10.579 --> 22:12.164
from pacemakers to vaccines.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.083
I think that

22:14.083 --> 22:15.626
might’ve put her
in Odin’s crosshairs, don’t you?

22:22.132 --> 22:24.426
Gene.

22:24.426 --> 22:26.262
I heard the board’s
called a meeting.

22:26.262 --> 22:28.847
What’s going on?
Odin...

22:28.847 --> 22:32.101
This about China?
It’s not just China.

22:32.101 --> 22:34.603
We’re getting word that
India, Indonesia, Brazil,

22:34.603 --> 22:36.522
they’re all making moves
to ban Odker’s search engine

22:36.522 --> 22:38.190
from their countries.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.609
Okay, there must be some
misinformation out there.

22:40.609 --> 22:42.236
A few phone calls
will sort this out.

22:42.236 --> 22:44.405
It won’t help
anyone to panic.
It’s past that.

22:44.405 --> 22:46.115
Have you checked
the stock lately?

22:46.115 --> 22:48.450
Word’s already hit the street.
We’re in free fall.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.828
Our Asia team’s been making
some back-channel inquiries.

22:50.828 --> 22:53.289
We don’t know why, but their
contacts say it’s about you.

22:53.289 --> 22:55.040
They want you out.

22:55.040 --> 22:58.252
Is this some sort of a joke?
This is my company.

22:58.252 --> 23:00.963
No, it’s not.

23:00.963 --> 23:02.548
Not since we went public,
it isn’t.

23:02.548 --> 23:04.300
I’m sorry,

23:04.300 --> 23:05.926
but the board’s been issued
an ultimatum:

23:05.926 --> 23:07.678
If Odker wants
to do business

23:07.678 --> 23:09.346
with half the world’s
population,

23:09.346 --> 23:11.557
then you have to resign.

23:13.309 --> 23:14.935
Look, I think you have
the wrong impression

23:14.935 --> 23:17.021
of what we do here
at Heal the Wild.

23:17.021 --> 23:19.273
We’re lobbyists,
not eco-terrorists.

23:19.273 --> 23:21.817
You were in ongoing
discussions with Talia Baccaro

23:21.817 --> 23:23.736
in the weeks leading
up to her murder.

23:23.736 --> 23:24.903
Oh, yes,
but we weren’t conspiring

23:24.903 --> 23:26.488
to disrupt the flow of L.A.L.

23:26.488 --> 23:28.198
We were talking about
how she could shift

23:28.198 --> 23:30.367
her business away
from harvesting crab’s blood

23:30.367 --> 23:31.994
and toward
the manufacture

23:31.994 --> 23:33.370
of L.A.L.’s synthetic
alternative.

23:33.370 --> 23:36.248
I didn’t realize there was
an alternative to L.A.L.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.833
Oh, yes. The synthetic’s
been available for years,

23:37.833 --> 23:39.627
but thanks to limited
availability

23:39.627 --> 23:41.295
and antiquated FDA regulations,

23:41.295 --> 23:43.631
the big biomedical companies
have been slow to embrace it.

23:43.631 --> 23:45.007
So hundreds of thousands
of horseshoe crabs

23:45.007 --> 23:46.550
are being bled
unnecessarily.

23:46.550 --> 23:50.346
Mm-hmm, and Talia understood
the wisdom of making the change.

23:50.346 --> 23:52.181
She recognized that
horseshoe crab populations

23:52.181 --> 23:54.975
are in significant decline,
and if they go extinct,

23:54.975 --> 23:56.810
then the synthetic will be
the only option anyway.

23:56.810 --> 23:59.355
In other words,
she was receptive to your pitch.

23:59.355 --> 24:01.899
Yeah, she was, but now that
she’s gone, all we can do

24:01.899 --> 24:03.734
is hope that her brother
is able to convince

24:03.734 --> 24:05.903
whoever takes over her lab
to pick up where she left off.

24:05.903 --> 24:07.321
Her brother?
Mm-hmm.

24:07.321 --> 24:09.323
Collin Baccaro.

24:09.323 --> 24:11.742
He’s one of our
biggest backers.

24:11.742 --> 24:13.285
He’s the one who convinced Talia

24:13.285 --> 24:15.120
to meet with us
in the first place.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.039
Thank you for
your time. Watson?

24:17.039 --> 24:20.084
I assume the name
"Collin Baccaro"

24:20.084 --> 24:21.752
meant something
to you?
Not a thing.

24:21.752 --> 24:23.212
Then why leave
so abruptly?

24:23.212 --> 24:24.880
Because the name
of Mr. Baccaro’s company

24:24.880 --> 24:26.632
means something
to me.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.717
Odin didn’t have Talia
killed to save lives.

24:28.717 --> 24:30.386
He did it for a far more
traditional reason:

24:30.386 --> 24:32.137
to make money.

24:38.644 --> 24:39.269
Okay,

24:39.269 --> 24:41.397
so you and Joan wanted
everything I could find

24:41.397 --> 24:43.107
on every unsolved murder

24:43.107 --> 24:45.442
in the tri-state area on the
two dates you asked about?

24:45.442 --> 24:47.695
Here you go.
April 6 and May 20.

24:51.657 --> 24:53.409
Either of you gonna
tell me what makes

24:53.409 --> 24:55.411
those dates
so special?

24:55.411 --> 24:57.287
We will,
just not today.

24:57.287 --> 24:58.539
(cell phone ringing)

25:00.916 --> 25:02.167
Bell.

25:02.167 --> 25:05.087
Yeah, he’s right here.

25:05.087 --> 25:09.174
The Odin Reichenbach?
The tech guy?

25:09.174 --> 25:11.260
I’ll tell him. Thanks.

25:11.260 --> 25:13.679
You know Odin
Reichenbach?
Mm-hmm.

25:13.679 --> 25:16.557
He a client?
Something like that.

25:16.557 --> 25:18.767
He’s here to see you.

25:18.767 --> 25:20.436
Mahoney said she parked him
in the conference room.

25:32.364 --> 25:35.826
Don’t suppose you’d mind
closing the door?

25:35.826 --> 25:37.411
Don’t suppose
you’d mind confessing

25:37.411 --> 25:39.037
to the many murders
you’ve orchestrated?

25:49.173 --> 25:51.008
I’ll admit this is
the last place

25:51.008 --> 25:52.843
I thought you would
pay me a visit.

25:52.843 --> 25:54.553
Wanted you
to feel safe.

25:54.553 --> 25:58.056
But you didn’t want me to record
anything you had to say.

25:58.056 --> 26:00.267
I don’t see any blue screens
in the bullpen.

26:00.267 --> 26:01.977
Well, that wouldn’t have
looked very good, would it?

26:01.977 --> 26:03.729
If I’d shown up,

26:03.729 --> 26:05.439
everyone’s phones and
computers stop working?

26:05.439 --> 26:08.317
The technology’s range
is controllable.

26:08.317 --> 26:12.279
Mm. So what do you want?

26:12.279 --> 26:13.614
Well, I’m sure
you’ve heard about it,

26:13.614 --> 26:15.073
but I’m having a bad week.

26:15.073 --> 26:16.700
My board wants me gone.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.410
I know your father’s

26:18.410 --> 26:20.496
the one behind it.

26:20.496 --> 26:22.664
I’ve known the name Morland
Holmes for a good while now.

26:22.664 --> 26:24.875
Well, name me an evil
billionaire that doesn’t.

26:24.875 --> 26:27.544
Hmm. I didn’t think
he’d help you.

26:27.544 --> 26:31.215
I was led to believe your
relationship was quite frosty.

26:31.215 --> 26:34.259
Do we exchange
Christmas cards? No.

26:34.259 --> 26:36.720
But we both share a distaste
for mass murderers.

26:37.846 --> 26:39.932
A while ago, you cautioned me

26:39.932 --> 26:42.601
to take a step back before I did

26:42.601 --> 26:45.145
"the irrevocable." Now I’m
asking you to do the same.

26:45.145 --> 26:48.065
Removing me from Odker
would cripple my ability

26:48.065 --> 26:50.442
to save innocent lives.
I’m begging you,

26:50.442 --> 26:52.402
don’t do that.

26:52.402 --> 26:54.571
That’s rich. You talking
about innocent lives.

26:54.571 --> 26:56.907
What about the ones
you’ve taken?

26:56.907 --> 26:58.283
What about

26:58.283 --> 26:59.743
Talia Baccaro?

26:59.743 --> 27:01.161
She wasn’t a killer.

27:01.161 --> 27:02.704
She wasn’t gonna hurt anyone,

27:02.704 --> 27:04.623
but you had her executed.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.542
Why? So you could buy

27:06.542 --> 27:09.294
a video analysis company
called FrameSift.

27:09.294 --> 27:12.798
Watson and I first became aware
of FrameSift several months ago.

27:12.798 --> 27:15.259
You had just revealed
yourself to us

27:15.259 --> 27:16.760
and we were learning
everything we could

27:16.760 --> 27:18.136
about you and your companies.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.471
FrameSift didn’t
mean anything

27:19.471 --> 27:22.474
at the time, it was just another
of your recent acquisitions.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.977
Then we started looking into
Talia’s murder, and we saw that

27:24.977 --> 27:28.105
FrameSift was founded by
her brother, Collin Baccaro.

27:28.105 --> 27:29.690
Then we looked a little
further, and we saw

27:29.690 --> 27:31.900
that Collin didn’t want
to sell FrameSift to you.

27:31.900 --> 27:33.861
He’d already rejected
several of your offers.

27:33.861 --> 27:36.029
Then Talia was killed.

27:36.029 --> 27:38.490
Collin takes a leave of absence
to grieve, and while he’s gone,

27:38.490 --> 27:41.076
his board approved
a merger with Odker.

27:41.076 --> 27:42.786
Now I would ask you why
you didn’t just kill him,

27:42.786 --> 27:44.037
but the answer is obvious.

27:44.037 --> 27:45.831
He was an asset.

27:45.831 --> 27:48.834
The company was worth more
with him than without.

27:48.834 --> 27:50.711
But his sister,
on the other hand...

27:50.711 --> 27:55.090
Is that why you think I acquired
FrameSift? To make money?

27:57.885 --> 28:01.346
What happened to Talia Baccaro
wasn’t about profit.

28:01.346 --> 28:03.348
It was about saving more lives.

28:03.348 --> 28:06.602
FrameSift’s algorithms
allow us

28:06.602 --> 28:09.229
to go through
online video footage

28:09.229 --> 28:12.566
and identify who’s in it,
where they are,

28:12.566 --> 28:14.109
and what they’re doing.

28:14.109 --> 28:16.403
And more than that,

28:16.403 --> 28:20.198
they read verbal intonations
and facial expressions.

28:20.198 --> 28:22.200
And you think they can tell

28:22.200 --> 28:24.286
when people have murder
on their minds?

28:24.286 --> 28:25.537
By themselves? No.

28:25.537 --> 28:28.040
But with our data?

28:28.040 --> 28:29.625
FrameSift’s technology
has already

28:29.625 --> 28:31.501
helped me save dozens of people.

28:31.501 --> 28:33.795
In a few years, that number
could be in the hundreds,

28:33.795 --> 28:35.422
maybe even
the thousands.

28:35.422 --> 28:38.675
Now tell me, what is one life
compared to...

28:38.675 --> 28:40.719
all that?

28:40.719 --> 28:44.640
One innocent life, you mean.

28:47.184 --> 28:50.228
(sighs)

28:50.228 --> 28:53.899
I think you should go now.

29:14.544 --> 29:17.005
(door opens, closes)

29:20.842 --> 29:22.636
No English guy this time?

29:22.636 --> 29:24.096
You two figured

29:24.096 --> 29:25.514
I’d open up to another woman?

29:25.514 --> 29:26.556
I don’t know about that,

29:26.556 --> 29:28.100
but we were hoping
you’d respond to the truth.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.768
And what is that, exactly?

29:29.768 --> 29:32.854
That your handlers lied to you,
told you whatever it took

29:32.854 --> 29:35.232
to make you believe that
you were doing the right thing.

29:35.232 --> 29:37.526
You must think
I’m very gullible.

29:37.526 --> 29:38.735
Actually, the opposite.

29:38.735 --> 29:40.320
I think it
must’ve been

29:40.320 --> 29:42.531
really hard to convince you
to commit murder.

29:42.531 --> 29:45.283
That’s why my partner
and I are so sure

29:45.283 --> 29:48.370
that you met someone
face-to-face, and when you did,

29:48.370 --> 29:49.913
they explained how
they knew so much

29:49.913 --> 29:51.915
about the people
they wanted you to kill.

29:51.915 --> 29:53.750
They must’ve shown you
that they had access

29:53.750 --> 29:56.586
to private online data,
people’s texts and e-mails.

29:56.586 --> 29:58.797
They convinced you that
everything they said was real.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.382
I’m guessing they didn’t
tell you the person

30:00.382 --> 30:03.218
behind it all was
Odin Reichenbach, CEO of Odker.

30:09.474 --> 30:11.685
You know the name?

30:11.685 --> 30:13.979
I’ve seen him in the news.

30:13.979 --> 30:16.314
It fits, right?
Hearing that it’s him

30:16.314 --> 30:17.566
answers a lot of questions

30:17.566 --> 30:18.942
you were already
asking yourself.

30:18.942 --> 30:21.361
What if it does?
What do you think

30:21.361 --> 30:23.905
telling me his name
is going to accomplish, huh?

30:23.905 --> 30:25.615
You gonna give me some
speech about Big Brother,

30:25.615 --> 30:28.577
or due process,
or invading people’s privacy?

30:28.577 --> 30:29.703
Because if I
did everything

30:29.703 --> 30:31.913
you think I did,
isn’t it pretty obvious

30:31.913 --> 30:33.749
that I already signed up
for all of that?

30:33.749 --> 30:35.917
Yes, you did.

30:35.917 --> 30:38.128
But you didn’t sign on for this.

30:38.128 --> 30:40.922
This is Talia Baccaro’s brother,
Collin Baccaro.

30:40.922 --> 30:43.008
Collin had a company
that Odker wanted to buy,

30:43.008 --> 30:44.885
but Collin didn’t want to sell.

30:44.885 --> 30:46.595
Then Talia was murdered,

30:46.595 --> 30:48.972
and it let Odin buy the company
out from under him.

30:48.972 --> 30:52.559
This is every e-mail and text
that Talia sent for a month

30:52.559 --> 30:54.102
before she died;
none of it shows

30:54.102 --> 30:55.979
that she was a threat to anyone.

30:55.979 --> 30:58.482
So whatever Odin’s people
told you, it was a lie.

30:58.482 --> 31:01.026
Odin wanted
Talia dead

31:01.026 --> 31:03.445
because it fit his corporate
strategy, and for that,

31:03.445 --> 31:04.696
you killed an innocent woman.

31:04.696 --> 31:07.449
No.

31:07.449 --> 31:09.785
No, you’re lying.

31:14.289 --> 31:17.167
Look for yourself,
and then we’ll talk.

31:20.170 --> 31:23.590
(door opens, closes)

31:29.679 --> 31:31.598
(door opens, closes)

31:34.351 --> 31:36.728
You’re late.
I was getting worried.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.814
Odin Reichenbach came to see me
at the precinct.

31:38.814 --> 31:41.733
Oh?

31:41.733 --> 31:44.194
Everything you’ve done,
it’s working.

31:44.194 --> 31:47.239
(laughs softly)

31:47.239 --> 31:49.866
By my understanding,
he should be ousted

31:49.866 --> 31:52.661
no later than
the end of business tomorrow.

31:52.661 --> 31:54.037
He’ll still be dangerous,
of course,

31:54.037 --> 31:55.372
but, uh, he should be
much more vulnerable

31:55.372 --> 31:57.582
to your investigation.

31:57.582 --> 32:00.252
In the meantime, everyone
that you say he has threatened--

32:00.252 --> 32:01.962
your friends
and their loved ones--

32:01.962 --> 32:04.214
they’re being watched by my men.

32:04.214 --> 32:07.175
Here, and in England.
If any of his people

32:07.175 --> 32:11.429
dare to go after them, they’re
in for a very rude surprise.

32:11.429 --> 32:13.807
Well, I hope you don’t mind,

32:13.807 --> 32:15.725
I-I thought the room
needed some warming up.

32:15.725 --> 32:16.643
Thank you.

32:18.061 --> 32:19.896
Not for the fire, for the help.

32:21.857 --> 32:23.650
It can’t have been cheap,

32:23.650 --> 32:25.735
enlisting the help of
your fellow influence peddlers.

32:25.735 --> 32:27.237
We prefer

32:27.237 --> 32:30.240
"puppet masters
of the highest order."

32:30.240 --> 32:31.867
Hmm.

32:31.867 --> 32:33.869
But you’re right.

32:33.869 --> 32:36.329
I’ve already been summoned
to afternoon tea

32:36.329 --> 32:38.373
by an associate

32:38.373 --> 32:41.835
to discuss
the terms of repayment.

32:41.835 --> 32:44.713
Whatever the price,
it will have been worth it.

32:44.713 --> 32:47.299
You know, when I wrote you
and you didn’t respond,

32:47.299 --> 32:48.550
I wasn’t sure you’d come.

32:51.595 --> 32:53.513
(sighs)

32:57.851 --> 33:00.187
Don’t I always?

33:08.737 --> 33:10.655
(phone ringing)

33:13.074 --> 33:14.326
(door closes)

33:14.326 --> 33:16.244
Watson.

33:18.246 --> 33:20.457
I almost quit teaching.

33:23.084 --> 33:27.088
I didn’t think I could ever walk
into my classroom again.

33:27.088 --> 33:29.674
I barely wanted
to leave the house.

33:31.801 --> 33:34.054
It took a month
after the shooting

33:34.054 --> 33:35.597
to reopen the school.

33:35.597 --> 33:38.225
They had an open house
the Sunday before,

33:38.225 --> 33:40.810
I... couldn’t go.
(sniffles)

33:40.810 --> 33:42.729
(grunts)

33:42.729 --> 33:45.106
But then a friend called
and said that

33:45.106 --> 33:48.026
every single kid showed up.

33:48.026 --> 33:52.364
They all wanted to be there.
Not one parent said no, a...

33:52.364 --> 33:55.450
and so I thought...

33:55.450 --> 33:57.786
if all the kids

33:57.786 --> 34:01.665
were brave enough to go back,

34:01.665 --> 34:04.501
who was I to back down?

34:04.501 --> 34:09.214
So, Monday morning, I went back.

34:11.925 --> 34:16.388
But I swore I would never
be powerless again.

34:16.388 --> 34:17.931
So you bought a gun.

34:17.931 --> 34:21.226
I bought a gun,
and I took lessons.

34:21.226 --> 34:23.520
Not like I brought
it to the school,

34:23.520 --> 34:25.313
it just made me feel better.

34:25.313 --> 34:27.941
Anyway,

34:27.941 --> 34:30.193
I started running into
this woman at the range.

34:30.193 --> 34:33.238
Kate. We would chat.

34:33.238 --> 34:35.490
She told me that
she’d heard about

34:35.490 --> 34:37.284
what I had been through.

34:37.284 --> 34:39.327
She was grooming you.

34:41.204 --> 34:46.459
After a while, she said
she belonged to this group.

34:46.459 --> 34:49.004
People who found a
way to change things.

34:49.004 --> 34:52.966
And she asked me,
what if picking myself up

34:52.966 --> 34:55.343
after what happened wasn’t
the only thing I could do?

34:55.343 --> 34:57.595
What if I could help

34:57.595 --> 34:59.639
prevent the
next tragedy?

34:59.639 --> 35:01.516
And you said
you were interested.

35:01.516 --> 35:05.687
Odin’s people would have
thoroughly vetted you online.

35:05.687 --> 35:06.938
By the time
they propositioned you,

35:06.938 --> 35:08.732
they would have known
how you would answer.

35:08.732 --> 35:11.735
Kate showed me all the
information they had access to,

35:11.735 --> 35:13.862
how they could predict
if someone

35:13.862 --> 35:15.655
was going to do
something terrible.

35:15.655 --> 35:17.949
We settled on a
way that we would

35:17.949 --> 35:21.661
communicate online
and I started getting missions.

35:23.580 --> 35:26.750
(crying): And I just did
whatever they said.

35:28.835 --> 35:31.546
Did you ever get
Kate’s second name...

35:33.715 --> 35:36.343
...or find out
where she lived?

35:36.343 --> 35:39.012
Did you ever see any proof
that her name really was Kate?

35:42.223 --> 35:44.184
The gun range would’ve
checked the woman’s ID.

35:44.184 --> 35:45.477
If she bought ammo,
they would have kept

35:45.477 --> 35:47.103
her information
in a log.

35:47.103 --> 35:48.355
We can also check
their surveillance video.

35:48.355 --> 35:49.731
Odin may have

35:49.731 --> 35:52.150
already gotten to it,
but maybe not.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.693
We’re going to need
you to tell the police

35:53.693 --> 35:54.944
everything you’ve told us.

35:54.944 --> 35:56.863
But before you do,

35:56.863 --> 35:59.991
my partner found three
potholders at your home.

35:59.991 --> 36:03.453
Talia Baccaro
accounts for one,

36:03.453 --> 36:05.330
so we’d like to hear
about the other two murders

36:05.330 --> 36:07.123
you were assigned.

36:14.089 --> 36:16.091
I was surprised

36:16.091 --> 36:17.967
to be invited back so soon.

36:17.967 --> 36:19.844
Perhaps I wanted
to see you again

36:19.844 --> 36:21.596
while I knew you were
still in New York.

36:21.596 --> 36:23.765
Ah.

36:23.765 --> 36:27.018
(clears throat)

36:27.018 --> 36:29.270
Well, I’m flattered.

36:29.270 --> 36:32.690
But I’m humble enough to know
that it’s more than that.

36:32.690 --> 36:35.694
A matter of some urgency
has come up, I take it?

36:35.694 --> 36:38.446
Dissidents have
been disrupting business

36:38.446 --> 36:42.909
in the port of Guangzhou,
and, uh, their activity has seen

36:42.909 --> 36:46.121
an uptick in recent days,
which threatens

36:46.121 --> 36:47.914
to embarrass your government.

36:47.914 --> 36:49.916
If that’s
the urgent matter

36:49.916 --> 36:52.168
on your mind,
then you’re in luck.

36:52.168 --> 36:53.962
Well, I believe

36:53.962 --> 36:56.464
that I can negotiate
a coming to the table

36:56.464 --> 36:58.007
between your government

36:58.007 --> 37:00.218
and the dissident party’s
leaders.

37:00.218 --> 37:03.263
That won’t be necessary.

37:03.263 --> 37:06.474
The leaders of that group
were arrested several hours ago.

37:07.809 --> 37:09.811
Oh.

37:09.811 --> 37:11.479
Really?

37:11.479 --> 37:13.398
It was
my understanding

37:13.398 --> 37:17.152
that your government
couldn’t locate them.

37:17.152 --> 37:22.198
You warned me the other day
that the world is changing.

37:22.198 --> 37:26.453
I fear it has
already changed.

37:26.453 --> 37:29.456
And we have no choice
but to change with it.

37:31.374 --> 37:33.168
(chuckles softly)

37:33.168 --> 37:34.961
Mm.

37:34.961 --> 37:38.173
(sighs)

37:38.173 --> 37:42.552
Odin Reichenbach

37:42.552 --> 37:44.721
led you to the dissidents.

37:47.390 --> 37:49.392
He got to you.

37:49.392 --> 37:54.731
Not to me directly,
but to the people I serve.

37:54.731 --> 37:58.151
He frightens
them, Morland.

37:58.151 --> 38:01.488
He controls the information
people see.

38:01.488 --> 38:05.408
He can turn a nation
against its leaders,

38:05.408 --> 38:08.119
sway an election,

38:08.119 --> 38:11.331
incite a revolution;
or, if he wishes,

38:11.331 --> 38:14.459
he can help those leaders
maintain order.

38:16.503 --> 38:19.714
That kind of power

38:19.714 --> 38:22.383
makes you and me obsolete.

38:25.678 --> 38:28.890
What...

38:28.890 --> 38:32.352
What will happen to my son?

38:37.565 --> 38:40.026
I’m sorry, old friend.

38:56.501 --> 38:58.086
(clears throat)

38:58.086 --> 39:00.338
Hey. What’s up?

39:00.338 --> 39:01.714
Uh, i-is Marcus around?

39:01.714 --> 39:03.550
I was hoping to find
the two of you together.

39:03.550 --> 39:05.760
No, he’s out in the field.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.845
I guess you’re stuck with me.

39:07.845 --> 39:11.099
Everything all right?

39:11.099 --> 39:13.017
Well, the short answer is no,

39:13.017 --> 39:16.437
and the long answer
is a good deal longer.

39:20.733 --> 39:24.529
Watson and I know who ordered
Patrick Meers to shoot you.

39:24.529 --> 39:26.656
We’ve known for quite some time.

39:30.326 --> 39:32.829
So Odin Reichenbach
takes all this data,

39:32.829 --> 39:34.831
and he uses it
to single out people

39:34.831 --> 39:37.417
he thinks are about
to commit violent acts

39:37.417 --> 39:39.544
and then he has them killed.

39:39.544 --> 39:42.255
Using the same vast
access to information,

39:42.255 --> 39:44.007
he identifies individuals
that he thinks

39:44.007 --> 39:45.550
he might be able to
turn to his cause

39:45.550 --> 39:48.928
and then, using operatives
to insulate himself,

39:48.928 --> 39:51.681
he recruits them to
work as vigilantes.

39:51.681 --> 39:53.683
Like Patrick Meers.

39:53.683 --> 39:55.143
Correct.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.106
I thought you’d be angry.

40:02.775 --> 40:04.777
Of course I’m angry.

40:04.777 --> 40:07.572
With me, for keeping
this from you.

40:07.572 --> 40:09.449
Am I happy about that?

40:09.449 --> 40:12.368
No.

40:12.368 --> 40:14.162
(sighs)

40:14.162 --> 40:18.082
But the truth is,
this all started with me.

40:18.082 --> 40:20.209
I’m the one who didn’t
see Patrick Meers coming,

40:20.209 --> 40:21.753
I’m the one who got shot.

40:21.753 --> 40:24.380
You and Joan
were gone.

40:24.380 --> 40:27.258
Moved on.
You came back from London

40:27.258 --> 40:30.261
and put yourself
in the middle of all this

40:30.261 --> 40:32.889
because of me.
What’s the next move?

40:32.889 --> 40:35.266
Bring in the witness
you were talking about?

40:35.266 --> 40:38.478
Annie Spellman,
one of Odin’s volunteer killers.

40:38.478 --> 40:40.521
She’s eager to cooperate.

40:40.521 --> 40:44.067
If Reichenbach got his hooks
into as many people as you said,

40:44.067 --> 40:46.277
we’re gonna have to be
very careful about

40:46.277 --> 40:49.405
who we bring this to, even after
he resigns from his company.

40:49.405 --> 40:51.824
Anyone he compromised will
have motive to tank the case.

40:51.824 --> 40:54.160
You have anyone in mind?

40:54.160 --> 40:57.121
There’s an A.D.A. I like.

40:57.121 --> 40:59.791
A judge.

40:59.791 --> 41:03.378
I’ll make a careful approach,
feel them out.

41:03.378 --> 41:05.713
Keep all communications
in-person.

41:05.713 --> 41:07.590
No phones,

41:07.590 --> 41:09.384
no e-mails.

41:09.384 --> 41:11.219
I’ll let you know
when I have it all lined up.

41:16.140 --> 41:18.226
I spoke to the captain.
He’s reaching out to...

41:19.602 --> 41:21.062
Marcus.

41:22.897 --> 41:24.399
Something’s happened.

41:26.693 --> 41:27.944
BELL:
I, uh,

41:27.944 --> 41:29.946
I just got a call from a buddy

41:29.946 --> 41:31.781
in Queens North Homicide.

41:31.781 --> 41:34.450
He had responded

41:34.450 --> 41:37.036
to a body that was found
out in Willets Point.

41:38.913 --> 41:41.249
ID was on him.

41:49.132 --> 41:51.300
I’m so sorry, Sherlock.

41:54.762 --> 41:57.223
My father is dead?
