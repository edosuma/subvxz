and afraid. I guess.

- Come all the way up.

11:34.477 --> 11:35.925
- Fuck you.
- Come all the way up.

11:35.935 --> 11:37.925
Let's go, come on! Up!

11:37.935 --> 11:39.925
Ah, no! No...

11:39.935 --> 11:41.675
Oh, my God, what the fuck!

11:41.685 --> 11:43.384
I feel like I'm being
pretty fuckin' clear

11:43.395 --> 11:45.425
I need a modicum of space
every 24 hours.

11:45.435 --> 11:47.383
It's your brother.
He absolutely insisted...

11:47.393 --> 11:49.258
Is it true? About the coffee?

11:49.268 --> 11:51.091
Uh, what, Dad?

11:51.101 --> 11:52.185
Can you give us a minute?

11:53.894 --> 11:56.842
Yeah, sure, he kept pouring,
and it just went everywhere.

11:56.852 --> 11:59.592
- Like he didn't even see.
- Jesus. He's not right.

11:59.602 --> 12:01.592
Local TV. Local news.

12:01.602 --> 12:03.759
Here's a news story for you:

12:03.769 --> 12:06.679
Elderly local man doesn't realize
he's getting butt-fucked by Google.

12:06.690 --> 12:09.840
I am not going back to Shanghai. I
saved the company when he was sick.

12:09.851 --> 12:11.341
Did you hear the way he talked to me?

12:11.351 --> 12:13.175
That was his tone the entire
time I was at the studio.

12:13.185 --> 12:15.091
Oh, dude, I know. So patronizing.

12:15.101 --> 12:16.800
Who knows how many people
live in Indonesia?

12:16.810 --> 12:18.564
Who actually gives a shit?
Fuck Indonesia.

12:18.575 --> 12:21.326
- Sounds like a medical condition.
- One of us eventually takes over,

12:21.337 --> 12:24.300
- there's gonna be nothing left.
- Like, how many people live in your ass?

12:24.310 --> 12:26.626
- Rip Van Fucking Asshole.
- It's like the firm's being run

12:26.637 --> 12:28.133
by a compulsive hoarder.

12:28.143 --> 12:31.091
It's this big old, ugly, spooky house,

12:31.101 --> 12:32.842
and he's all caked up in the middle

12:32.852 --> 12:34.383

12:34.393 --> 12:35.967
with the local news blaring,

12:35.977 --> 12:38.383

12:38.393 --> 12:40.967
Anyway, are you gonna do something?

12:40.977 --> 12:43.175
- I should.
- Yeah, you should.

12:43.185 --> 12:44.967
And the only way he'll respect you

12:44.977 --> 12:46.717
is if you try to destroy him,
because in your position,

12:46.727 --> 12:49.009
that is exactly what he would try to do.

12:49.019 --> 12:51.967
(SIGHS) Yeah.

12:51.977 --> 12:53.592
I can't do that.

12:53.602 --> 12:56.226
Well, obviously, so have fun
in Shanghai.

12:57.935 --> 13:02.216
Work's... Work's goin' OK,
I would say, yup.

13:02.226 --> 13:04.091
Workin' hard.

13:04.101 --> 13:07.091
One of the symptoms of
an approaching nervous breakdown

13:07.101 --> 13:10.009
is the belief that one's "work"

13:10.019 --> 13:13.009
is ever so important.

13:13.019 --> 13:14.592
That's Bertrand Russell.

13:14.602 --> 13:16.967
Huh. Yes, indeed.

13:16.977 --> 13:19.842
Yes... Yes to that.

13:19.852 --> 13:22.592
Um, but I sometimes think,

13:22.602 --> 13:26.009
and I... you know, I know
you're very busy with the ranch

13:26.019 --> 13:28.341
and with you readings and your research,

13:28.351 --> 13:30.216
but I sometimes wonder if one day

13:30.226 --> 13:33.383
you wouldn't be interested in, like...

13:33.393 --> 13:36.967
giving up the seat on the board
and just, like, chilling out,

13:36.977 --> 13:39.383
like, just relaxing, you know?

13:39.393 --> 13:41.550
Life is nothing but a competition

13:41.560 --> 13:44.550
to be the criminal
rather than the victim.

13:44.560 --> 13:45.925
Also Bertrand Russell.

13:45.935 --> 13:48.884
I don't have a Bertrand Russell quote,

13:48.894 --> 13:52.633
because I just... haven't even
heard of him till now,

13:52.643 --> 13:55.508
but, um, but I do have this one.

13:55.518 --> 13:57.518

How was it?

14:10.477 --> 14:11.800
Ohh. Hi.

14:11.810 --> 14:14.101
- How do you feel?
- Great.

14:15.810 --> 14:17.300
I have some news.

14:17.310 --> 14:20.425
Ewan is definitely
coming to Thanksgiving.

14:20.435 --> 14:22.717
Ewan? Bullshit. Why?

14:22.727 --> 14:25.884
Why? Well, because he asked
and said he'd like to come,

14:25.894 --> 14:27.050
and I said yes.

14:27.060 --> 14:30.592
You're a pretty good liar.

14:30.602 --> 14:33.425
It's not good to have rifts
in the family.

14:33.435 --> 14:36.925
It's not a rift. He lives in
Canada... and he's a prick.

14:36.935 --> 14:39.717
Uh-huh. And how long since you spoke?

14:39.727 --> 14:41.967
We send him a fuckin'
birthday card, don't we?

14:41.977 --> 14:44.133
Not that I get any thanks.

14:44.143 --> 14:47.341
Look, so, we both know
you didn't come back

14:47.351 --> 14:49.175
out of love for my father.

14:49.185 --> 14:54.009
I guess what I wanted to ask
is, um... what's your plan?

14:54.019 --> 14:55.842
Ever hear of loyalty?

14:55.852 --> 14:58.592
Sure. Wasn't he one of the Seven Dwarfs?

14:58.602 --> 15:00.300
- Oh, boy.
- No?

they're not cogent.

And, you know,
in some ways that's his call,

15:28.101 --> 15:31.633
but, you know,
he pissed on my fucking floor.

15:31.643 --> 15:35.009
What if that got out?
No one wants to say it,

15:35.019 --> 15:39.175
but, uh. We can because...

15:39.185 --> 15:41.925
basically we love him, but he's not OK.

15:41.935 --> 15:45.009
What about he wakes up one night,

- No, it's nothing.

my lawyer was saying that...

She's a highly respected attorney
in the Twin Cities, Shiv.

16:57.060 --> 16:59.341
Sure. So what does your mom say?

16:59.351 --> 17:03.143
She says that the pre-nup
is a little, uh, unconscionable.

- Uh-huh.
- That's a legal term.

17:06.935 --> 17:09.300

- Gerri. Dreaming.
