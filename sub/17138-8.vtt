WEBVTT

00:01.274 --> 00:02.740
Time travel is real,

00:02.765 --> 00:05.124
and all of history is
vulnerable to attack,

00:05.149 --> 00:07.049
which is why we must
travel through time

00:07.051 --> 00:09.852
to stop the spread of these
so-called time aberrations,

00:09.854 --> 00:12.321
and to erase their damage to history.

00:12.323 --> 00:14.891
We are a team of outcasts and misfits,

00:14.893 --> 00:16.826
so please don't call us heroes.

00:16.828 --> 00:19.662
We're something else. We're legends.

00:19.664 --> 00:22.331
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

00:22.333 --> 00:24.834
You're back! I love you, Dad.

00:24.836 --> 00:27.003
When I last left 2016,

00:27.005 --> 00:28.771
that young woman did not exist.

00:28.773 --> 00:31.207
I do not want to lose my daughter.

00:31.209 --> 00:33.160
This amulet looks a lot like the one

00:33.185 --> 00:34.610
we recovered off the Nazis.

00:34.612 --> 00:36.879
- There's gotta be a connection.
- And we know that Damien Darhk

00:36.881 --> 00:38.948
and the speedster are
willing to kill for it.

00:58.570 --> 01:01.404
Mr. Capone...

01:01.406 --> 01:03.973
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

01:03.975 --> 01:05.908
I cancelled tickets to the opera,

01:05.910 --> 01:08.811
'cause I heard there
was new players in town.

01:08.813 --> 01:11.781
No one told me it was Halloween.

01:11.783 --> 01:14.150
Well, it's more like Christmas.

01:14.152 --> 01:16.052
That's... I like that, it's very good.

01:16.054 --> 01:19.055
See, my associate and I have
come with a proposition.

01:19.057 --> 01:20.656
We've seen how you run your empire,

01:20.658 --> 01:21.958
and we're impressed,

01:21.960 --> 01:23.392
but there's room for improvement.

01:23.394 --> 01:25.361
We'd like to offer our services.

01:25.363 --> 01:27.096
I got a better idea.

01:27.098 --> 01:32.535
How 'bout I show you how
business is done in my town?

01:34.439 --> 01:35.438
You or me?

01:35.440 --> 01:39.075
Oh, I've got...

01:39.077 --> 01:41.077
this.

01:41.079 --> 01:42.645
By now you've probably surmised

01:42.647 --> 01:44.947
that my friend and I
aren't from around here.

01:44.949 --> 01:47.116
- What do you freaks want?
- To help.

01:47.118 --> 01:49.385
I thought I made...
did I not make that perfectly clear?

01:49.387 --> 01:51.120
New enemies are coming to Chicago,

01:51.122 --> 01:53.255
and they will endanger your enterprises.

01:53.257 --> 01:55.825
And you're saying you
two can help me out?

01:55.827 --> 01:59.395
Actually, there's three of us.

01:59.397 --> 02:01.964
Pleasure to meet you.

02:01.966 --> 02:04.667
My name is Malcolm Merlyn.

02:07.920 --> 02:12.897
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

02:20.985 --> 02:24.553
Okay.

02:24.555 --> 02:26.055
New suit's good, but I think it needs

02:26.057 --> 02:27.790
those modifications Cisco mentioned.

02:27.792 --> 02:29.825
It's a poor hero to blame a super suit.

02:29.827 --> 02:32.061
Eh, exoskeleton. Come on, let's do this.

02:32.063 --> 02:34.330
I wanna get the kinks worked
out before our next mission.

02:34.332 --> 02:35.865
What's the rush? I think I'm doing

02:35.867 --> 02:37.933
a pretty good job picking up your slack.

02:37.935 --> 02:40.169
We scientists have a
name for that phenomenon.

02:40.171 --> 02:41.771
- It's called beginner's luck.
- Ooh.

02:41.773 --> 02:43.839
Hey!

02:43.841 --> 02:47.376
- What do you think you're doing?
- Uh, s... sparring.

02:47.378 --> 02:49.164
Yeah, he's helping me
calibrate the new suit.

02:49.189 --> 02:50.579
Last time y'all decided to spar,

02:50.581 --> 02:52.648
- you wrecked my cargo bay.
- Yeah.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.784
Hey!

02:54.786 --> 02:56.952
Don't make me come down here again.

03:02.260 --> 03:05.327
Don't you make me
come down here again.

03:05.329 --> 03:06.762
I'm gonna come down here again,
I'm watching you.

03:06.764 --> 03:10.266
Hey!

03:10.268 --> 03:12.234
- What is going on with them?
- You don't have any brothers

03:12.236 --> 03:14.603
- or sisters, do you?
- Nope.

03:14.605 --> 03:17.506
Sibling rivalry. Nothing to
be too worried about.

03:19.677 --> 03:21.844
This is why I'm glad

03:21.846 --> 03:23.546
I'm an only child.

03:32.056 --> 03:35.357
Oh, Jefferson, I was just, uh,
catching up on some reading.

03:37.962 --> 03:40.062
"The Fundamentals of Motorcycle Repair"?

03:40.064 --> 03:43.332
It's a fascinating subject.
Of course, I'm also researching

03:43.334 --> 03:46.836
the amulet Ms. Lance last
stole from Damien Darhk.

03:46.838 --> 03:48.437
You know, you might be
a genius when it comes

03:48.439 --> 03:50.573
to nuclear physics,
but when it comes to lying,

03:50.575 --> 03:52.508
you kinda suck at it, bro.

03:54.545 --> 03:56.450
You were thinking about
her again, weren't you?

03:56.475 --> 03:59.749
I can't help it.

03:59.751 --> 04:02.918
Every day, I recover new memories of her,

04:02.920 --> 04:05.421
each one a gift.

04:05.423 --> 04:08.824
Then I find myself worrying,
"What if there's a car accident,

04:08.826 --> 04:11.527
or... or a fire? Or she could
be struck by lightning."

04:11.529 --> 04:13.325
Yeah, I'd be more worried
about what happens

04:13.350 --> 04:14.997
when Sara finds out you have a daughter

04:14.999 --> 04:17.600
- that's a time aberration.
- She's not an aberration.

04:17.601 --> 04:20.536
The only reason Lily exists

04:20.538 --> 04:22.171
is because you convinced
your younger self

04:22.173 --> 04:23.839
to pay more attention to your wife,

04:23.841 --> 04:26.408
and less attention to
putting on a condom.

04:26.410 --> 04:28.444
You changed history,

04:28.446 --> 04:30.780
and one of these days,
either Nate or Gideon

04:30.782 --> 04:32.848
or anybody revealing the
historical timeline's

04:32.850 --> 04:35.117
- gonna figure that out.
- Not necessarily.

04:35.119 --> 04:37.253
According to my calculations,

04:37.255 --> 04:40.756
if Lily's impact on history
remains small enough,

04:40.758 --> 04:43.459
she may be able to go undetected.

04:45.129 --> 04:47.596
Excuse me, but
Dr. Haywood's seismograph

04:47.598 --> 04:50.599
- has detected an aberration.
- You were saying?

04:50.601 --> 04:53.135
- Who installed the alarms?
- That'd be me.

04:53.137 --> 04:55.237
- We should kill him.
- We got another one?

04:55.239 --> 04:57.306
Yeah, and judging by these
readings, it's a major one.

04:57.308 --> 04:59.508
Is there really cause for all this alarm?

04:59.510 --> 05:01.977
Perhaps the aberration
isn't as large as we think.

05:01.979 --> 05:04.547
The temporal tremors
originate from Union Station

05:04.549 --> 05:08.617
in Chicago, Illinois,
October 17th in the year 1927.

05:08.619 --> 05:11.320
That's fantastic.

05:11.322 --> 05:13.689
I-I mean, I've always
wanted to visit the roaring '20s

05:13.691 --> 05:15.257
right in the middle of Prohibition.

05:15.259 --> 05:17.726
That means no drinking. That's not good.

05:17.728 --> 05:20.563
Well, actually under Capone,
Chicago was a hot bed of vice.

05:20.565 --> 05:23.032
There was illegal drinking,
gambling, prostitution.

05:23.034 --> 05:25.434
Well, then, let's fire up
a tub and get there.

05:25.436 --> 05:28.671
Grab your fedoras,
we're going to the 1920s.

05:36.981 --> 05:41.116
I can't believe we're here.

05:41.118 --> 05:44.153
What are you so happy about?

05:44.155 --> 05:46.522
When I was younger,
I'd read my mother's magazines,

05:46.524 --> 05:48.824
and I'd see photos of Chicago.

05:48.826 --> 05:51.193
I'd never thought I'd
see it with my own eyes.

05:51.195 --> 05:53.462
Well, keep those eyes focused
on whatever's causing

05:53.464 --> 05:55.764
those temporal tremors.

05:55.766 --> 05:57.066
Copy that.

06:03.608 --> 06:05.774
That's Eliot Ness.

06:05.776 --> 06:09.511
He doesn't
look like Kevin Costner.

06:09.513 --> 06:11.046
What if somebody tipped off Capone

06:11.048 --> 06:13.249
that Ness is a future threat?

06:13.251 --> 06:15.117
Then his life's in danger.

06:15.119 --> 06:17.820
Don't worry, I'm on it.

06:17.822 --> 06:18.854
You go.

06:19.857 --> 06:22.157
Oh!

06:22.159 --> 06:25.094
Mr. Ness! Mr. Ness, hi.

06:25.096 --> 06:27.897
Uh, you don't know me.
My name is Ray Palmer.

06:27.899 --> 06:30.699
I have reason to believe that
your life may be in danger.

06:30.701 --> 06:32.167
It'd be best if you came with me.

06:32.169 --> 06:35.070
Mr. Ness, I'm Sergeant
Jones with Chicago PD.

06:35.072 --> 06:37.973
We're your security detail
on the way to the bureau.

06:37.975 --> 06:39.775
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Palmer,

06:39.777 --> 06:41.610
but it looks like I'm in good hands.

06:44.448 --> 06:46.649
Okay.

06:46.651 --> 06:47.917
What just happened?

06:47.919 --> 06:49.919
Well, it's the strangest thing.

06:49.921 --> 06:55.124
Uh, two cops just escorted
Eliot Ness to the bureau.

06:55.126 --> 06:57.092
They're not escorting him to the bureau.

06:57.094 --> 06:59.161
They're gonna throw him in the river.

06:59.163 --> 07:02.698
- What?
- Ray, 1920s Chicago PD

07:02.700 --> 07:05.134
was the most corrupt
police force in history.

07:05.136 --> 07:07.569
Almost all of them are
on Capone's payroll.

07:07.571 --> 07:09.438
Did you or did you not

07:09.440 --> 07:10.673
see "The Untouchables"?

07:10.675 --> 07:12.241
Jax, Stein,

07:12.243 --> 07:14.310
I need you to intercept Eliot Ness.

07:14.312 --> 07:17.379
He's being escorted by
two police officers.

07:28.259 --> 07:30.459
Grey! Didn't you hear Sara?

07:30.461 --> 07:32.027
- No.
- Oh.

07:34.365 --> 07:36.765
Oh, wait, hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey!

07:38.869 --> 07:40.903
What the hell happened back there?

07:40.905 --> 07:44.206
- How come you didn't stop him?
- I'm sorry, I got distracted.

07:44.208 --> 07:46.408
- By what?
- Tell her, Grey.

07:46.410 --> 07:48.010
It's not the professor's fault.

07:48.012 --> 07:50.145
Ray let Ness walk right
into Capone's hands.

07:50.147 --> 07:51.981
They were police officers,
and who's to say

07:51.983 --> 07:54.316
they didn't take him to the
FBI like they said they would?

07:54.318 --> 07:55.784
Gideon, pull up the Chicago Chronicle,

07:55.786 --> 07:58.821
- October 24th, 1931.
- Ah, yes,

07:58.823 --> 08:01.323
the day Al Capone originally
went down for tax evasion,

08:01.325 --> 08:03.025
only in this version of history,

08:03.027 --> 08:05.260
he becomes something far
worse than a criminal,

08:05.262 --> 08:06.829
he becomes a politician.

08:06.831 --> 08:09.331
Al Capone becomes mayor?

08:09.333 --> 08:11.934
Okay, I take it back.
Ness probably is screwed.

08:11.936 --> 08:13.335
Well, let's find out where they took him,

08:13.337 --> 08:17.339
so we can unscrew
him before this happens.

08:23.547 --> 08:24.847
Special agent Ness,

08:24.849 --> 08:26.582
you're having a hell of a first day.

08:26.584 --> 08:30.519
How do you know who I am?
And when I was coming to town?

08:30.521 --> 08:33.589
Some new friends of mine,
they whispered in my ear,

08:33.591 --> 08:35.289
so me and the boys decided
we would get you

08:35.292 --> 08:38.394
a nice welcome present. Cement galoshes.

08:38.395 --> 08:39.962
Very popular in Chicago these days,

08:39.964 --> 08:42.931
and I have a feeling these
will be just your size.

08:42.933 --> 08:45.501
Now, come on, try 'em on.

08:46.937 --> 08:49.838
- Any luck finding Ness?
- By the time you find Ness,

08:49.840 --> 08:53.308
he'll be swimming with the fishes.

08:53.310 --> 08:55.144
Mick, you beautiful genius, that's it.

08:55.146 --> 08:57.012
About time someone noticed.

08:57.014 --> 09:00.716
Gideon, set the course to
shipping harbor dock 39.

09:00.718 --> 09:02.384
What makes you so sure he'll be there?

09:02.386 --> 09:04.553
In the '20s, dock 39 was where Capone

09:04.555 --> 09:06.555
brought all of his enemies
and tied cinderblocks

09:06.557 --> 09:08.223
to their feet and tossed
them in the harbor.

09:08.225 --> 09:10.926
It became known as Cadaver's Cove.

09:17.168 --> 09:19.535
This isn't personal. I'm a businessman,

09:19.537 --> 09:22.304
and the Feds, well,
they're bad for business.

09:22.306 --> 09:25.707
The Bureau of Investigation
will never stop fighting,

09:25.709 --> 09:27.409
not until the fight is done.

09:27.411 --> 09:29.978
Poetic.

09:29.980 --> 09:31.880
I hope you wrote that down somewhere.

09:31.882 --> 09:34.183
Welcome to Chicago, Mr. Ness.

09:38.255 --> 09:40.422
All this for some booze?

09:40.424 --> 09:43.759
I like it. Nice getups.

09:43.761 --> 09:46.995
Seems our new friends have
got some friends of their own.

09:46.997 --> 09:48.097
Get 'em, boys.

10:05.916 --> 10:07.583
I'm going after Capone.

10:10.588 --> 10:13.489
Let 'em go, we got Ness.

10:13.491 --> 10:15.357
- Is he dead?
- Unconscious.

10:15.359 --> 10:17.793
He took on a lot of water.

10:20.131 --> 10:21.597
Merlyn was right.

10:21.599 --> 10:23.599
They took the bait.

10:31.498 --> 10:34.533
Special agent Ness has
suffered severe hypoxia.

10:34.535 --> 10:37.669
It will take some time to
reverse his brain damage.

10:37.671 --> 10:39.171
You can undo brain damage?

10:39.173 --> 10:41.206
Why haven't you helped Rory out?

10:41.208 --> 10:42.474
Who says I haven't?

10:42.476 --> 10:45.143
All right, let's get serious.

10:45.145 --> 10:48.480
Obviously, Capone somehow knew
that Ness would be the one

10:48.482 --> 10:50.415
- to take him down.
- When we were at the docks,

10:50.417 --> 10:52.584
Capone said something
about having new friends.

10:52.586 --> 10:55.821
But we have a bigger problem.
I mean, another problem.

10:55.823 --> 10:58.123
This week, Ness and his team
are supposed to obtain

10:58.125 --> 10:59.825
Capone's ledger from his bookkeeper.

10:59.827 --> 11:02.928
Now the IRS's case against
Capone for tax evasion

11:02.930 --> 11:05.197
is completely dependent on that ledger.

11:05.199 --> 11:07.332
Which Ness can't grab
while he's lying here

11:07.334 --> 11:08.467
with brain damage.

11:08.469 --> 11:10.435
Exactly, which means

11:10.437 --> 11:13.738
one of us has to take his place.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.874
- That's a stupid idea.
- It's pre-Internet.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.509
Nobody knows what Ness looks like.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.277
Nate's right, I got this.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.012
Actually, I was thinking I got this.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.647
Well, yeah, I mean, if the mission

11:22.649 --> 11:24.449
was impersonating Brad Pitt,
you'd be the man,

11:24.451 --> 11:26.084
but I think we can all
agree if anyone here

11:26.086 --> 11:27.953
looks like a G-man here, it's me.

11:27.955 --> 11:30.589
Well, we're in this situation,
because you learned history

11:30.591 --> 11:33.258
- from a movie.
- All right, enough.

11:33.260 --> 11:36.294
Ray, I'm sorry, but Nate
knows more about this area

11:36.296 --> 11:37.729
than any of us.

11:37.731 --> 11:39.331
- What's the plan?
- Okay.

11:39.333 --> 11:41.266
So if Capone's ledger is anywhere,

11:41.268 --> 11:44.436
it's probably at his primary
speakeasy, the Chelsea Club,

11:44.438 --> 11:46.238
so Ray and I will go to the Bureau,

11:46.240 --> 11:49.441
assemble Ness's team,
lead him to bust the place up,

11:49.443 --> 11:51.743
- grab the ledger.
- Great, take Rory with you.

11:51.745 --> 11:54.312
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:54.314 --> 11:57.115
Does this face look like a cop to you?

11:57.117 --> 11:58.850
If this were a JSA mission,

11:58.852 --> 12:00.886
we'd probably also send
someone undercover at the club.

12:00.888 --> 12:02.888
Well, I'm not doing that either.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.489
I'm done playing dress-up.

12:04.491 --> 12:05.790
Fine.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.626
I'll go the club with Jax and Stein,

12:07.628 --> 12:09.961
and you can stay here, drink your beers,

12:09.963 --> 12:11.429
and watch over Ness.

12:11.431 --> 12:12.597
What about me?

12:12.599 --> 12:16.234
- You can watch over him.
- What?

12:16.236 --> 12:18.336
Sorry.

12:21.608 --> 12:22.774
Beer.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.813
- There he is.
- Ah.

12:28.815 --> 12:31.850
- Special agent Cole Bennett.
- Yes, and you are?

12:31.852 --> 12:34.252
Special agent Eliot Ness.
This is my associate,

12:34.254 --> 12:36.855
- Bob De Niro.
- Well, I've assembled the team

12:36.857 --> 12:38.823
your telegram specified, Mr. Ness.

12:38.825 --> 12:40.725
Well, hope they're ready for some action,

12:40.727 --> 12:41.882
'cause they're gonna get it.

12:41.907 --> 12:44.062
Tonight we're gonna take
down the Chelsea club.

12:44.064 --> 12:46.298
Our files say Capone's got
nothing to do with that place.

12:46.300 --> 12:48.767
Well, your files are
embarrassingly outdated.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.702
We've learned Capone
has a stake in the club,

12:50.704 --> 12:52.504
and furthermore, he hides
a sizeable amount

12:52.506 --> 12:54.039
of Canadian whiskey in there.

12:54.041 --> 12:55.807
You fellas sure do
know an impressive amount

12:55.809 --> 12:57.409
about Capone's organization.

12:57.411 --> 13:00.512
Well, let's just say we
have people on the inside.

13:06.019 --> 13:08.353
This place is quite lively,
considering we haven't seen

13:08.355 --> 13:10.789
a single bottle of alcohol.

13:10.791 --> 13:13.158
Well, Nate said it was a speakeasy.

13:13.160 --> 13:16.061
Yeah, that's why it's called a speakeasy.

13:16.063 --> 13:18.330
You gotta know how to do
ask for the good stuff.

13:18.332 --> 13:20.098
Ah.

13:20.100 --> 13:25.203
Excuse me, I'd like a club soda, please.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.572
One club soda coming up.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.307
Here's what I wanna know.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.309
Why would somebody from
the future be interested

13:31.311 --> 13:32.944
in helping Al Capone?

13:32.946 --> 13:35.246
Well, we're here to find out.

13:37.217 --> 13:40.118
This is just a club soda.

13:45.425 --> 13:48.627
- You feeling all right?
- Fine.

13:48.629 --> 13:50.795
I guess I'm just surprised
you'd rather stay here

13:50.797 --> 13:53.431
on the ship than be out there.

13:53.433 --> 13:56.768
1920 Chicago seemed like your kinda town.

13:56.770 --> 13:58.770
You know, when I was younger,

13:58.772 --> 14:01.506
I always wanted to be a police officer.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.608
I didn't care that I was a girl.
I just really wanted

14:03.610 --> 14:06.111
- to wear a badge.
- Cute.

14:06.113 --> 14:09.147
The bad guys have all the fun, you know.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.454
It doesn't look like you're
having much fun right now.

14:21.595 --> 14:25.130
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

14:30.604 --> 14:33.972
Leonard.

14:33.974 --> 14:36.675
- I must be losing my mind.
- Of course you are.

14:36.677 --> 14:38.243
Why else would you still be here

14:38.245 --> 14:41.246
taking orders like a well-trained puppy?

14:41.248 --> 14:43.214
You're not right in the head, Mick.

14:43.216 --> 14:47.452
That's why I'm here, to set you straight.

14:55.996 --> 14:58.163
Ray, Nate, what's your status?

14:58.165 --> 15:01.633
Be careful, we're coming in.
Don't get caught in our net.

15:04.438 --> 15:07.338
What are squares like you
doing in a place like this?

15:07.340 --> 15:09.741
- You.
- Jefferson.

15:12.112 --> 15:15.146
What the hell?

15:15.148 --> 15:17.649
Jefferson, the speedster is here, run!

15:22.122 --> 15:24.723
Nobody move!

15:24.725 --> 15:26.758
- Federal officers.
- You're all under arrest

15:26.760 --> 15:28.359
for violations of the Volstead Act.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.595
Man!

15:30.597 --> 15:32.797
Hey, take it easy, that's our inside guy.

15:32.799 --> 15:34.999
Considering this club's
as dry as the Sahara,

15:35.001 --> 15:37.736
I'd say you need a new inside guy,
special agent Ness.

15:37.738 --> 15:40.338
Yeah.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.073
What the hell's happening in here?

15:42.075 --> 15:44.242
Damien Darhk showed
up with the speedster.

15:44.244 --> 15:46.277
They took Grey and Sara.

15:54.133 --> 15:56.844
This whole Capone
aberration was a distraction.

15:56.869 --> 15:59.821
Darhk and his speedster pal
knew it'd attract our attention.

15:59.823 --> 16:01.623
But why kidnap Sara and Stein?

16:01.625 --> 16:03.258
I mean, what could he want with them?

16:03.260 --> 16:04.659
Still trying to work that one out.

16:04.661 --> 16:06.061
- You all right, Jax?
- I'm pissed.

16:06.063 --> 16:07.696
Let it go, kid.

16:07.698 --> 16:10.098
There's nothing you can
do about the speedsters.

16:10.100 --> 16:12.567
We'll see about that.

16:12.569 --> 16:15.904
Long story short, Rip
had a secret armory.

16:15.906 --> 16:18.440
Me and Grey found it alongside
future Barry's message

16:18.442 --> 16:19.541
about the oncoming war.

16:19.543 --> 16:20.875
This speedster killed Rex

16:20.877 --> 16:22.610
and kidnapped our friends.

16:22.612 --> 16:24.212
We need him in the brig before dawn.

16:24.214 --> 16:27.382
Yeah, if this weapon does
what I think it does,

16:27.384 --> 16:28.783
we'll stop him dead in his tracks.

16:28.785 --> 16:30.285
Yeah, well, at's all well and good,

16:30.287 --> 16:32.120
but we still need to get
Capone's ledger back,

16:32.122 --> 16:33.822
otherwise history's screwed.

16:33.824 --> 16:35.857
Since your last plan was a total bust,

16:35.859 --> 16:38.359
I suggest somebody else
do the strategic thinking.

16:38.361 --> 16:39.928
Let me guess, that's you?

16:39.930 --> 16:43.031
All right, so let's
hear your brilliant idea.

16:43.033 --> 16:45.467
Well, I don't have one, but
it's gonna be better than yours.

16:45.469 --> 16:47.769
Enough.

16:47.771 --> 16:51.539
If you wanna nail
Capone and Rex's killer,

16:51.541 --> 16:53.608
you can't do it by playing a boy scout

16:53.610 --> 16:57.479
or an historian or a policeman.

16:57.481 --> 17:00.849
We do this my way,

17:00.851 --> 17:02.784
like a criminal.

17:09.992 --> 17:14.422
Yes, the Ritz-Carleton
it is definitely not.

17:14.446 --> 17:15.696
How did we get here?

17:15.699 --> 17:18.500
It appears our speedster
friend got the better of us.

17:18.502 --> 17:21.102
- And he wasn't working alone.
- Yes.

17:21.104 --> 17:24.873
Damien Darhk, a rather
predictable bedfellow

17:24.875 --> 17:27.876
for Al Capone.

17:27.877 --> 17:29.944
And don't forget about me.

17:29.946 --> 17:32.747
It's been a long time, Sara.

17:32.749 --> 17:35.350
You look good for someone
who's come back from the dead.

17:35.352 --> 17:38.486
Why am I not surprised
that you and Damien Darhk

17:38.488 --> 17:39.954
would find each other?

17:39.956 --> 17:41.856
What do you want with us?

17:41.858 --> 17:44.259
You have something we need,

17:44.261 --> 17:47.662
and while my partners think
I'm a fool for trying,

17:47.664 --> 17:49.597
I would like to broker a deal with you.

17:49.599 --> 17:53.501
You have in your possession an amulet.

17:53.503 --> 17:55.770
Give it to me,

17:55.772 --> 17:58.239
and I will give you nine
years of your life back.

17:58.241 --> 17:59.908
What are you talking about?

17:59.910 --> 18:02.243
Oh, maybe Oliver didn't tell you,

18:02.245 --> 18:05.580
but I was the one who arranged
to blow up the Queen's Gambit.

18:08.351 --> 18:11.386
That was the day everything
changed for you, Sara,

18:11.388 --> 18:13.555
hundreds of dominos toppling.

18:13.557 --> 18:19.093
Dr. Ivo, Slade Wilson,
the League of Assassins,

18:19.095 --> 18:20.762
losing your sister.

18:20.764 --> 18:23.031
And you losing your son.

18:23.033 --> 18:24.899
We both get clean slates.

18:24.901 --> 18:27.035
Why don't you just ask
your speedster friend

18:27.037 --> 18:28.469
to take you back in time?

18:28.471 --> 18:31.306
Because Malcolm's just his errand boy,

18:31.308 --> 18:34.108
sent to retrieve the amulet.

18:34.110 --> 18:35.944
Why is it so important?

18:35.946 --> 18:38.146
What does it matter?

18:38.148 --> 18:41.249
I'm giving you and your sister
a chance to live normal lives.

18:41.251 --> 18:43.818
To go back, maybe go to college,

18:43.820 --> 18:48.656
meet a nice boy, or a
girl, and settle down.

18:48.658 --> 18:50.158
No thank you.

18:50.160 --> 18:52.927
I was never meant for those things,

18:52.929 --> 18:55.063
and I know that now.

18:55.065 --> 18:56.865
And besides, you can't just go back

18:56.867 --> 18:58.466
and change things like that.

19:00.570 --> 19:02.070
Why not?

19:02.072 --> 19:04.806
Because time is sacred,

19:04.808 --> 19:07.542
and it can't be changed to
suit any one person's desire

19:07.544 --> 19:11.412
without harming the lives
of countless others.

19:11.414 --> 19:14.582
But you wouldn't remember
any of this, would you?

19:14.584 --> 19:18.419
You would be blissfully
unaware of time travel,

19:18.421 --> 19:22.190
of loss, of heartbreak.

19:22.192 --> 19:24.092
You'd be happy,

19:24.094 --> 19:27.095
and isn't that what
matters most in the end?

19:30.333 --> 19:33.334
Hey, Malcolm.

19:33.336 --> 19:35.470
I'll take a nightmare that's real

19:35.472 --> 19:38.239
over a dream that's a lie.

19:42.646 --> 19:46.014
That was remarkably selfless.

19:46.016 --> 19:48.816
Well, I had a good teacher.

19:48.818 --> 19:51.486
Yes, Captain Hunter.

19:51.488 --> 19:54.222
No.

19:54.224 --> 19:56.357
I was talking about you.

20:06.670 --> 20:08.069
What the hell?

20:11.808 --> 20:13.007
Shoot her!

20:21.918 --> 20:23.484
Come on! Get out of here!

20:23.486 --> 20:24.752
Get out of here!

20:26.890 --> 20:29.557
Hi, I'm Clyde. That's Bonnie.

20:29.559 --> 20:32.126
Get out of the truck.

20:32.128 --> 20:33.995
Do you have any idea
who you're stealing from?

20:33.997 --> 20:35.863
Yes, now where's the truck headed?

20:35.865 --> 20:38.099
Uh, 31st and Fort Dearborn Drive.

20:38.101 --> 20:40.702
Much obliged.

20:42.105 --> 20:45.440
Hold that.

20:45.442 --> 20:47.342
Aren't you forgetting something?

20:47.344 --> 20:49.010
Nate and Ray?

20:49.012 --> 20:51.279
Those idiots have done
nothing but get in the way.

20:51.281 --> 20:53.614
Uh, guys, we're...
We're standing right here.

20:53.616 --> 20:56.800
Well... get in the back.

20:56.825 --> 20:58.886
I can't believe Malcolm
thought I would actually

20:58.888 --> 21:01.689
take that deal.

21:01.691 --> 21:04.392
You really weren't tempted?

21:04.394 --> 21:06.661
Of course,

21:06.663 --> 21:09.998
but we can't let a man
like that change history.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.500
Imagine the havoc that it would cause.

21:12.502 --> 21:14.836
Oh, yes, when it comes to time travel,

21:14.838 --> 21:17.839
even the best of us can wreak havoc.

21:17.841 --> 21:20.541
What do you mean?

21:20.543 --> 21:23.044
Martin?

21:23.046 --> 21:24.312
You have been acting weird

21:24.314 --> 21:26.714
ever since we fought the Dominators.

21:26.716 --> 21:30.084
What's going on?

21:30.086 --> 21:32.520
It was an innocent mistake...

21:32.522 --> 21:35.723
I was just trying to give
myself a bit of marital advice.

21:35.725 --> 21:38.426
Never did I imagine it
would ever have an effect.

21:38.428 --> 21:41.362
You caused an aberration?

21:41.364 --> 21:45.099
I have a daughter.

21:45.101 --> 21:46.934
A what?

21:48.138 --> 21:52.140
A full-grown human progeny

21:52.142 --> 21:54.776
who I never even knew I had.

21:54.778 --> 21:57.745
- This beautiful, brilliant...
- And not real.

21:57.747 --> 22:02.417
At first, no, but then I remembered.

22:02.419 --> 22:05.720
I remembered the...
The countless nights I spent

22:05.722 --> 22:07.355
pacing the neighborhood
with her stroller,

22:07.357 --> 22:10.124
trying to get her to sleep. The... the...

22:10.126 --> 22:14.762
The way my heart melted the
first time she smiled at me.

22:14.764 --> 22:18.433
The... the distress she caused
her kindergarten teacher

22:18.435 --> 22:21.803
when she insisted on
singing the periodic table

22:21.805 --> 22:23.938
instead of the alphabet. I-I...

22:23.940 --> 22:26.374
I remembered all of it.

22:26.376 --> 22:28.609
But none of that happened to you.

22:28.611 --> 22:32.380
But the memories are real.

22:32.382 --> 22:34.882
They are a part of me now.

22:34.884 --> 22:38.519
She is a part of me now.

22:41.157 --> 22:43.224
And I love her.

22:43.226 --> 22:45.827
Martin, you were the
one who talked me into

22:45.829 --> 22:47.929
not killing Damien Darhk,

22:47.931 --> 22:49.797
into not bringing my sister back,

22:49.799 --> 22:53.267
because of the damage that
it would do to history.

22:53.269 --> 22:57.572
Ugh, I'm sorry, but my ears were burning.

22:57.574 --> 23:01.642
I understand Malcolm tried to play nice

23:01.644 --> 23:04.011
and offer you a deal.

23:04.013 --> 23:05.546
Since you didn't bite,
we're gonna have to be

23:05.548 --> 23:07.982
a little rougher.

23:07.984 --> 23:09.884
Do your worst.

23:09.886 --> 23:11.919
Oh, you didn't think that I meant you?

23:13.490 --> 23:15.923
Oh, I fear with your
league-training torture,

23:15.925 --> 23:20.595
while fun, would be a waste of time.

23:26.035 --> 23:27.468
Sara?

23:27.470 --> 23:29.670
Whatever you do,
don't give them anything.

23:29.672 --> 23:30.972
No!

23:30.974 --> 23:34.108
Martin! Martin!

23:40.984 --> 23:42.416
Ah!

23:45.955 --> 23:49.223
Professor Stein, am I right?

23:49.225 --> 23:52.193
- Do I know you?
- Let's just say...

23:52.195 --> 23:56.597
It's complicated.

23:56.599 --> 23:59.667
I'm not gonna lie to ya.
This, um, little toy

23:59.669 --> 24:03.070
usually leaves the subject well dead,

24:03.072 --> 24:04.505
but I've adjusted it

24:04.507 --> 24:07.663
so that you should only
feel a little pain...

24:09.078 --> 24:12.046
In theory.

24:27.297 --> 24:29.830
You're not the regular driver.
What happened to Vinny?

24:29.832 --> 24:33.034
Vinny, he, uh, he's hanging
out with your mother.

24:33.036 --> 24:34.769
- What?
- What?

24:37.907 --> 24:39.941
- So here's the plan.
- Is for us to rescue the people

24:39.943 --> 24:42.176
- that got caught because of you.
- She's talking about you.

24:42.178 --> 24:43.515
Nah, I think she was talking about you.

24:43.539 --> 24:44.612
Shut up!

24:44.614 --> 24:46.013
You're supposed to be partners.

24:46.015 --> 24:47.748
Partners have each other's backs.

24:47.750 --> 24:49.517
All right, Mick's right. We can all agree

24:49.519 --> 24:50.818
that we need to get Capone's ledger.

24:50.820 --> 24:53.854
- Fair?
- Agreed.

25:04.367 --> 25:05.299
Sara?

25:10.373 --> 25:11.939
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

25:11.941 --> 25:13.708
We need to find Stein.

25:20.250 --> 25:22.116
You know, for a homicidal gangster,

25:22.118 --> 25:23.985
Capone was very organized,

25:23.987 --> 25:25.586
and had exquisite penmanship.

25:31.661 --> 25:33.027
Check it out.

25:33.029 --> 25:35.129
Is that it?

25:35.131 --> 25:36.864
Bingo.

25:36.866 --> 25:38.065
Let's go.

25:44.707 --> 25:46.507
Watch where you point that thing.

25:46.509 --> 25:48.976
- Snart.
- You shouldn't be here, Mick.

25:48.978 --> 25:50.945
Capone's men might be from 1927,

25:50.947 --> 25:53.881
but their bullets work just fine.

25:53.883 --> 25:55.750
Do you really wanna risk your life

25:55.752 --> 25:57.818
for a skirt and a geezer?

25:57.820 --> 26:00.454
- Any sign of the professor?
- Not yet.

26:00.456 --> 26:02.556
Aw, sounds like a sweet little angel

26:02.558 --> 26:04.392
whispering in your ear.

26:04.394 --> 26:06.827
Problem is, angels always
want you do the right thing,

26:06.829 --> 26:10.031
and doing the right
thing gets you killed.

26:10.033 --> 26:11.565
I should know.

26:11.567 --> 26:14.869
You wanna stay alive,
best listen to the devil.

26:14.871 --> 26:18.372
Get out now.

26:18.374 --> 26:21.642
Too late.

26:21.644 --> 26:23.010
Hey, you found them.

26:23.012 --> 26:24.565
- Are you guys okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

26:24.590 --> 26:26.347
- Let's get out of here.
- Oh, good, yeah.

26:26.349 --> 26:29.684
Oh, whoa.

26:29.686 --> 26:32.568
Oh, my God, you're Al Capone.

26:32.593 --> 26:34.317
- That's Scarface.
- Yeah, I-I don't think

26:34.342 --> 26:35.857
- he likes that nickname.
- No?

26:35.882 --> 26:38.326
I don't like when people
try and steal what's mine.

26:38.328 --> 26:39.627
How do you think it makes me feel

26:39.629 --> 26:41.996
seeing all you thieves on my property?

26:41.998 --> 26:44.332
I'm gonna go out on a
limb and say not good.

26:44.334 --> 26:46.500
See, the doctor used
to give me these pills,

26:46.502 --> 26:48.336
said they would help calm me down.

26:48.338 --> 26:50.338
Then one day, I realized the only thing

26:50.340 --> 26:53.040
that makes me feel any better is killing.

26:53.042 --> 26:54.408
Time for some therapy.

26:57.613 --> 26:59.513
Aah!

27:05.621 --> 27:07.421
Whoo. Thanks, buddy.

27:07.423 --> 27:09.790
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

27:09.792 --> 27:11.092
Yeah.

27:28.678 --> 27:30.244
How'd I do?

27:30.246 --> 27:32.980
You totally sold it, Al.

27:32.982 --> 27:34.515
Thought so.

27:34.517 --> 27:36.083
You sure Mr. Thawne ain't gonna be mad

27:36.085 --> 27:37.351
'cause we let 'em go?

27:37.353 --> 27:40.321
Oh, quite the opposite.

27:49.660 --> 27:52.694
Hey, Grey, Grey,
you're safe now, it's okay.

27:52.696 --> 27:54.029
- Grey.
- What?

27:54.031 --> 27:56.331
- Grey?
- Oh, uh, I'm sorry,

27:56.333 --> 27:58.033
I-I-I didn't hear you.
I'm... I'm... I'm little...

27:58.035 --> 27:59.668
A little discombobulated.

27:59.670 --> 28:01.403
Whoo! Well, that was close,

28:01.405 --> 28:03.905
but a win's a win, and we
got the team back together.

28:03.907 --> 28:06.408
Well, technically you and Rory
got the team back together.

28:06.410 --> 28:08.677
And we got the ledger. Bro hug?

28:08.679 --> 28:10.178
Do it.

28:10.180 --> 28:12.180
Okay, I think this is
all a little premature.

28:12.182 --> 28:14.149
We still don't have
an ID on the speedster.

28:14.151 --> 28:15.784
Who's now added Malcolm Merlyn

28:15.786 --> 28:17.686
to his team of time travelling psychos.

28:17.688 --> 28:20.922
And he wanted the amulet that
I took off of Darhk in 1987.

28:20.924 --> 28:22.758
What would someone with
the speedster's power

28:22.760 --> 28:25.093
- want with ancient artifacts?
- Perhaps...

28:25.095 --> 28:27.796
Perhaps I should take
a look at the amulet.

28:27.798 --> 28:30.832
I may be able to unlock
some of its mysteries.

28:30.834 --> 28:32.367
All right.

28:44.047 --> 28:45.914
Ah, so you didn't get a chance

28:45.916 --> 28:48.617
to kill your boyfriend's killer, huh?

28:48.619 --> 28:51.720
It's not vengeance I'm after, Mick.

28:51.722 --> 28:53.021
It's justice.

28:53.023 --> 28:55.023
Right, right.

28:55.025 --> 28:57.292
Well, for what it's worth,
you looked good tonight.

28:57.294 --> 28:59.861
Being a bad guy suits you.

29:02.466 --> 29:04.166
Thank you.

29:08.739 --> 29:11.239
Um, I'm hungry.

29:15.512 --> 29:16.845
What's next, Mick?

29:16.847 --> 29:19.514
Long walks on the beach,
just the two of you?

29:19.516 --> 29:21.183
For a figment of my imagination,

29:21.185 --> 29:23.285
you're really beginning
to be a pain in my ass.

29:23.287 --> 29:26.121
Look, I get it, she's easy on the eyes,

29:26.123 --> 29:27.155
tough in the fight.

29:27.157 --> 29:28.390
She's just a friend,

29:28.392 --> 29:30.058
the one friend I have,

29:30.060 --> 29:32.594
since my last friend blew himself up.

29:32.596 --> 29:33.695
Care for a little advice?

29:33.697 --> 29:36.264
From a dead guy? No.

29:36.266 --> 29:39.734
Don't let the new girl
rope you into her death wish.

29:39.736 --> 29:42.771
This whole sacrificing
yourself for your friends thing

29:42.773 --> 29:46.074
isn't as fun as it sounds.

29:46.076 --> 29:48.176
Trust me.

30:03.827 --> 30:07.496
What the hell?

30:07.498 --> 30:10.432
Sara, stay out of the library.

30:16.540 --> 30:19.608
How you feeling?

30:19.610 --> 30:21.643
I'm all right.

30:21.645 --> 30:23.211
Look, I know you've
been through a lot,

30:23.213 --> 30:25.847
but we really need to
talk about the aberration

30:25.849 --> 30:28.817
that you caused.

30:28.819 --> 30:30.719
Perhaps some other time.

30:33.957 --> 30:36.291
-What were you doing in here, anyways?

30:36.293 --> 30:39.027
- Righty-tighty, lefty-loosey.
- I speak six languages, why...

30:39.029 --> 30:40.729
Stein's about to kill
Sara in the library.

30:40.731 --> 30:42.011
With the rope or the candlestick?

30:42.035 --> 30:43.698
Guys, I'm serious.

30:43.700 --> 30:45.667
Somehow, the speedster's
disguised himself as Stein,

30:45.669 --> 30:47.102
and he's turning over the whole ship.

30:47.104 --> 30:48.490
- I'll suit up.
- I know how to get Sara

30:48.514 --> 30:50.572
away from fake Stein.
What about that speedster gun?

30:50.574 --> 30:52.507
Yeah, I'm already on it.

30:52.509 --> 30:54.509
Martin, you've been
acting pretty different

30:54.511 --> 30:56.845
ever since Darhk tortured you.

30:56.847 --> 31:00.282
Did they offer you a
deal like they did me?

31:00.284 --> 31:02.817
Help us, and we won't hurt your daughter?

31:02.819 --> 31:04.886
My daughter?

31:04.888 --> 31:07.455
Sara, uh, Jackson and
I were just on the bridge,

31:07.457 --> 31:09.057
and, um...

31:09.059 --> 31:11.760
He wanted to talk to
you about ship stuff.

31:11.762 --> 31:13.395
Ship stuff?

31:13.397 --> 31:15.096
Yeah.

31:15.098 --> 31:17.365
Okay.

31:17.367 --> 31:19.267
I'm sure there's no need to rush off.

31:19.269 --> 31:20.702
Jax can wait.

31:20.704 --> 31:22.571
Since when do you call him Jax?

31:22.573 --> 31:24.072
Actually, it's, uh, it's pretty urgent.

31:24.074 --> 31:25.774
We should go now.

31:25.776 --> 31:27.108
Okay.

31:52.769 --> 31:54.603
My speedster weapon.

31:54.605 --> 31:56.171
Impressive.

31:57.774 --> 32:00.575
Unfortunately for you,
the effects are only temporary.

32:00.577 --> 32:02.477
What did you do with Stein?

32:02.479 --> 32:05.580
Oh, I wouldn't waste my energy
worrying about him right now.

32:05.582 --> 32:08.249
Whatever you're gonna do, do it now.

32:08.251 --> 32:10.218
In a rush to die, are we?

32:10.220 --> 32:12.320
I wasn't talking to you.

32:17.995 --> 32:20.662
He's headed towards the bridge, come on.

32:20.664 --> 32:22.631
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

32:24.001 --> 32:25.800
What the hell is he doing in there?

32:25.802 --> 32:27.902
Cloaking shield disengaged.

32:27.904 --> 32:28.903
That's not good.

32:28.905 --> 32:31.172
Cargo bay door now opening.

32:31.174 --> 32:33.074
That is definitely not good.

32:35.679 --> 32:37.078
Tear the ship apart.

32:37.080 --> 32:39.247
Kill anyone you find.

32:48.425 --> 32:50.558
The speedster just locked
himself inside the bridge.

32:50.560 --> 32:52.360
Great, so we got him trapped.

32:52.362 --> 32:54.095
Call me an optimist.

32:54.097 --> 32:55.563
And by the sound of it,
he's letting his buddies

32:55.565 --> 32:56.531
onto the ship.

33:07.711 --> 33:11.613
Guys, could use a little help here.

33:11.615 --> 33:13.815
Okay, Nate and I will
help Sara hold them off.

33:13.817 --> 33:15.884
- I'll guard Ness.
- What about the speedster?

33:15.886 --> 33:17.419
Well, he's after to amulet,
so all we have to do

33:17.421 --> 33:19.754
is just keep him in the bridge...

33:23.060 --> 33:24.592
What are you doing?

33:24.594 --> 33:26.628
Capone's men are taking over the ship.

33:28.598 --> 33:32.167
We got bigger fish to fry, honey.

33:32.169 --> 33:33.435
Rex's killer?

33:36.206 --> 33:38.606
He's tossing the ship.
He's looking for the amulet.

33:38.608 --> 33:41.109
It's only gonna be a matter
of time before he finds it.

33:41.111 --> 33:43.378
Then how do we stop him?

33:43.380 --> 33:45.180
What would a criminal do?

33:45.182 --> 33:46.247
Run.

33:49.486 --> 33:51.719
Steel-up.

33:59.629 --> 34:01.329
Isn't that just like a thug?

34:01.331 --> 34:03.798
Brings a Tommy gun
to an ion blaster fight?

34:07.137 --> 34:10.772
Ah, yeah.

34:12.042 --> 34:14.342
Hey, I stole that fair and square.

34:14.344 --> 34:18.813
This belongs to me.

34:18.815 --> 34:19.813
Surprise.

34:33.362 --> 34:37.364
Eliot taught you well,

34:37.367 --> 34:39.567
but unless you hand over the amulet,

34:39.569 --> 34:41.803
I'm gonna have to teach
you a few new lessons.

34:41.804 --> 34:44.672
Those who cannot do teach.

35:04.995 --> 35:07.162
I remember you.

35:07.164 --> 35:12.133
You're here because I killed
that moronic leader of the JSA.

35:12.135 --> 35:15.637
Mr. Rex Tyler was it?

35:15.639 --> 35:16.938
Aah!

35:33.190 --> 35:34.656
Don't worry,

35:34.658 --> 35:37.058
you'll be joining Mr. Tyler soon enough.

35:41.131 --> 35:42.197
Lucky girl.

35:47.771 --> 35:49.504
I gave you an out.

35:49.506 --> 35:53.741
Not just a chance to survive,
but to live a better life.

35:53.743 --> 35:55.577
I already found a better life.

35:55.579 --> 35:56.744
One without you in it.

36:06.389 --> 36:08.556
But what about your friend, Martin Stein?

36:08.558 --> 36:10.124
Where is he?

36:10.126 --> 36:11.693
Aah!

36:11.695 --> 36:14.796
My dear, that information
comes at a cost.

36:23.769 --> 36:25.769
Don't look so glum, professor.

36:25.771 --> 36:28.505
You'll be in good company at
the bottom of this here river.

36:28.507 --> 36:31.074
Thieves, snitches, do-gooder cops,

36:31.076 --> 36:33.844
they've all run afoul in my organization,

36:33.846 --> 36:35.412
but you...

36:35.414 --> 36:37.914
I've never had to whack a professor before.

36:37.916 --> 36:40.384
Guess I'm moving up in
the world, hey, boys?

36:51.363 --> 36:54.031
The speedster, how did
you manage to defeat him?

36:54.033 --> 36:56.533
I didn't. I made him a counter-offer.

36:58.570 --> 37:00.437
I gave him the amulet.

37:02.574 --> 37:05.142
I still don't understand.
The last thing I remember

37:05.144 --> 37:08.045
was getting off the train.
Everything else is a blur.

37:08.047 --> 37:09.780
I wouldn't worry about that, Mr. Ness.

37:09.782 --> 37:12.482
After our investigation,
we concluded you were kidnapped

37:12.484 --> 37:15.519
by an imposter, some idiot

37:15.521 --> 37:17.854
posing as you trying
to bring down Capone.

37:17.856 --> 37:19.489
The gentleman who was impersonating you

37:19.491 --> 37:21.425
was trying to do the right thing.

37:21.450 --> 37:24.181
Luckily, he found some
useful information.

37:24.183 --> 37:26.050
- What's this?
- Everything you need to know

37:26.052 --> 37:27.818
to take down Capone.

37:27.820 --> 37:29.987
If you look closely,
you'll find some discrepancies

37:29.989 --> 37:31.622
in his bookkeeping.

37:31.624 --> 37:33.857
You expect me to believe that Al Capone

37:33.859 --> 37:37.094
is gonna be taken down by tax evasion?

37:37.096 --> 37:38.829
Sounds screwy.

37:38.831 --> 37:41.665
Actually, it'd make a pretty
good movie one day.

37:45.371 --> 37:48.839
You know, if this is the week
the Feds get Capone's ledger,

37:48.841 --> 37:51.141
why does it take four more
years for them to take him down?

37:51.143 --> 37:53.978
Because it's the federal government.

37:59.986 --> 38:02.052
Now that's the Mick Rory I remember,

38:02.054 --> 38:04.355
always thinking with his stomach.

38:04.357 --> 38:06.090
Shut up.

38:06.092 --> 38:08.092
Who are you talking to?

38:08.094 --> 38:09.560
Nobody.

38:09.562 --> 38:12.563
Anyway, I thought I'd find you in here.

38:14.800 --> 38:17.001
That speedster hit you pretty hard, huh?

38:17.003 --> 38:19.169
I got gothick head.

38:19.171 --> 38:21.305
What's that?

38:21.307 --> 38:23.974
A little present for keeping me alive,

38:23.976 --> 38:27.945
and for helping me almost get Rex's killer.

38:27.947 --> 38:29.480
Open it.

38:32.985 --> 38:36.653
I lifted it back at Capone's warehouse.

38:36.655 --> 38:39.423
You stole it.

38:39.425 --> 38:40.691
You were right.

38:40.693 --> 38:44.561
The bad guys really do have more fun.

38:44.563 --> 38:47.965
Not that you're a bad guy.

38:47.967 --> 38:51.435
I hope it was worth it.
All this for a kiss on the cheek

38:51.437 --> 38:54.538
and a cheap bottle of booze.

38:54.540 --> 38:57.808
That speedster could've killed you, Mick.

38:57.810 --> 39:00.677
What then?

39:00.679 --> 39:02.880
I'll be dead like you.

39:08.254 --> 39:11.088
My evil doppelganger left quite a mess.

39:11.090 --> 39:13.657
It'll take me weeks to
reorganize my notes.

39:13.659 --> 39:15.392
Well, it's good to have you back,

39:15.394 --> 39:18.295
- the real you.
- Well, thanks to your efforts.

39:18.297 --> 39:23.867
Though, I have to say I'm a bit puzzled.

39:23.869 --> 39:26.437
Predicting history is
our team's raison d'être,

39:26.439 --> 39:30.040
yet you traded the amulet to our enemies,

39:30.042 --> 39:31.809
a choice which will no doubt have

39:31.811 --> 39:34.044
countless repercussions on history.

39:34.046 --> 39:35.813
I'm starting to think that

39:35.815 --> 39:39.149
maybe some things are more
important than history.

39:39.151 --> 39:42.786
You know, you, me, and this team...

39:42.788 --> 39:44.521
We're a family,

39:44.523 --> 39:48.392
a messed up one, but still a family.

39:48.394 --> 39:49.927
I might not be able to save Laurel,

39:49.929 --> 39:53.931
but I can protect this family,

39:53.933 --> 39:57.267
and that includes yours.

39:57.269 --> 40:00.704
What's her name?

40:00.706 --> 40:02.539
Lily.

40:02.541 --> 40:04.575
Lily.

40:04.577 --> 40:06.643
It's a beautiful name.

40:08.059 --> 40:09.692
We should leave soon.

40:09.717 --> 40:12.349
You're certainly in a
hurry to get out of 1927.

40:12.351 --> 40:13.817
Not your concern, Malcolm,

40:13.819 --> 40:15.752
particularly now that we
have what we came for.

40:15.754 --> 40:17.488
Well, now that we have the matching set,

40:17.513 --> 40:19.667
do you care to tell us why we
went through so much trouble?

40:19.669 --> 40:21.792
Well, they are not a matching set.

40:21.794 --> 40:24.528
In fact, they are not a they.

40:24.530 --> 40:25.829
They are an it.

40:25.831 --> 40:27.498
It's an amulet in two pieces.

40:27.500 --> 40:30.067
I knew that you were more than
just a pretty face, Malcolm.

40:34.273 --> 40:39.209
Wow, it's a portable planetarium.

40:39.211 --> 40:40.544
It's a compass.

40:40.546 --> 40:42.946
Compasses generally find things.

40:42.948 --> 40:45.549
Indeed. Have either of you gentlemen

40:45.551 --> 40:47.584
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

40:47.586 --> 40:49.720
Yes, it was a spear
that was reportedly used

40:49.722 --> 40:52.723
to penetrate the sight of Christ
after he died on the cross.

40:52.725 --> 40:57.261
And now it can be used
to rewrite reality itself.

40:57.263 --> 40:59.263
So, how do we find it?

40:59.265 --> 41:01.732
Well, it's complicated,
but the first step

41:01.734 --> 41:04.234
is with the person that
Mr. Darhk met briefly

41:04.236 --> 41:07.604
in New York. You remember
Captain Rip Hunter?

41:14.580 --> 41:17.381
Rip Hunter, stop where you are!

41:20.219 --> 41:21.385
Cut!

41:25.624 --> 41:30.527
Yeah, I told you idiots to
move these garbage cans.

41:30.529 --> 41:36.066
Can we try to...
To get this right, people?

41:36.068 --> 41:39.036
I don't wanna be here all night.

41:43.409 --> 41:46.376
Am I talking to myself? Today!
