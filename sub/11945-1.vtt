four, three, two, one, zero.

00:49.816 --> 00:51.853
Ignition.

00:59.275 --> 01:04.775
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one!

01:04.900 --> 01:07.816
- Blast off!
- Guys, guys, please, wait! Please!

01:07.943 --> 01:11.107
This is very risky stuff here, and I'm
a highly trained professional astronaut.

01:11.235 --> 01:14.352
- Here you go.
- Now, Uncle Phil
will launch another rocket...

01:14.485 --> 01:17.152
just as soon as he completes
his fuel intake.

01:17.277 --> 01:19.434
Thanks, darlin'.

01:19.569 --> 01:23.230
Now, you know, it takes
six months just to reach Mars.

01:23.361 --> 01:28.861
Then a year on the surface, six months
back. It's, like, two years, you know?

01:28.987 --> 01:32.933
Anyway, guess what I'm tryin'
to say here is that, um...

01:33.070 --> 01:36.768
you know, this bein' my last night
on Earth and everything...

01:36.904 --> 01:41.526
this could be a very, uh,
precious memory for me.

01:41.654 --> 01:44.226
Nice try.

01:44.363 --> 01:46.354
- William, get that thing
out of your nose.
- But I like it.

01:46.488 --> 01:48.942
- Don't you talk back to Mommy.
- There you are.

01:53.239 --> 01:55.195
- Hey, Woody.
- Yeah?

01:55.323 --> 01:57.562
Our Mars One crew won't be
heading back to Earth...

01:57.698 --> 02:01.194
till ten days after you guys land
at our base camp with Mars Two.

02:01.323 --> 02:02.864
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, thank you, Reneé.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.447
That's a pretty good long rendezvous,
don't you think?

02:04.573 --> 02:08.817
- What are you suggesting, Sergei?
- I think maybe you should bring
a baseball bat.

02:08.949 --> 02:12.694
- Yes, we will play American baseball
on Mars, our two crews.
- Oh, please.

02:12.824 --> 02:15.657
- We could have ourselves
a little solar system series.
- Half you guys are foreigners.

02:15.783 --> 02:18.355
- We'd crush you.
- No, no, no, because
we have equal crews.

02:18.492 --> 02:20.862
We have three men, one woman.
Same handicap.

02:20.992 --> 02:23.112
Easy now. That's my wife
you're talking about...

02:23.243 --> 02:25.695
and Terri just happens to be
one hell of a shortstop.

02:27.367 --> 02:30.200
Fast pitch, no steals,
batter calls his own strikes.

02:30.326 --> 02:33.490
- Thousand bucks make it interesting?
- Oh, winner take all.

02:33.618 --> 02:36.023
Good. You bring the balls.

02:36.160 --> 02:38.317
You know the best thing
about our mission?

02:38.452 --> 02:41.534
On Mars Two, technically, I outrank her,
so for the first time in our marriage...

02:41.661 --> 02:44.778
she's gonna have to do
everything I say, right, honey?

02:44.911 --> 02:47.482
- Yes, honey.
- Yes, honey, sir...

02:47.619 --> 02:49.990
with a little salute helps.

02:50.120 --> 02:53.984
- Yes, honey, sir.
- Yeah, I like it. It's good.

02:54.120 --> 02:56.905
- Take that corn up there, all right?
- Yes, sir.

02:57.037 --> 03:00.119
I'm not sure how I feel about NASA
allowing couples...

03:00.246 --> 03:02.734
to go on this type
of mission together.

03:04.163 --> 03:07.244
Well, nothin' personal, Terri.
I mean--

03:07.371 --> 03:11.781
It-- It's just that it's, uh--
It's a funny feelin'
for those of us stayin' behind.

03:11.914 --> 03:14.532
Yes, but you know that all the research
shows that marriage will provide...

03:14.664 --> 03:16.987
stability on
these long duration trips.

03:17.123 --> 03:20.867
Then they haven't studied
some of the couples I've known.

03:20.998 --> 03:24.363
Luke. Come on, baby. He's not comin'.

03:25.956 --> 03:29.157
This isn't right.
I mean,Jim deserves this too.

03:29.290 --> 03:30.913
- All of his friends are here.
- I know.

03:31.040 --> 03:33.446
- It's my last night here.
- Hey!

03:33.583 --> 03:36.451
It's your last night with us too.

03:36.583 --> 03:38.869
- I know. I'm sorry, baby.
- Mm-hmm.

03:41.041 --> 03:44.622
- I love you, Deb.
- I love you too.

03:44.751 --> 03:47.618
Maybe you should spend
some time with Bobby.

03:47.750 --> 03:50.286
- Yeah, where is he?
- Up in his fort.

03:50.417 --> 03:54.791
- Oh. Okay.
- Millions of miles away.

03:54.918 --> 03:57.288
Deep space.

03:57.418 --> 04:02.076
So lonesome, so cold.

04:02.210 --> 04:04.165
So lame, Nick.

04:08.253 --> 04:10.622
Knock, knock.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.457
Bobby?

04:17.378 --> 04:21.622
Your friends are out there playin'.
What are you doin' up here?

04:21.754 --> 04:25.878
Who's gonna read to me now at bedtime?

04:26.005 --> 04:28.375
Your mother will.

04:30.630 --> 04:33.628
But I like when you do it.

04:33.755 --> 04:37.584
- Now we're never gonna finish our book.
- Bobby.

04:39.172 --> 04:41.708
Listen, I've been thinkin'
about that too, okay?

04:41.839 --> 04:43.830
And what I figured out was--

04:43.964 --> 04:46.916
How about if I bring along my own copy?

04:47.048 --> 04:50.959
And then every night wherever I am
I'll read a little bit more of it.

04:51.091 --> 04:53.958
And you and Mommy, you can read a little
bit more of it wherever you are.

04:54.090 --> 04:57.421
And it'll be kind of like
we're reading it together.

04:57.550 --> 04:59.624
'Cause, hey, I don't know about you,
but I'm kind of anxious...

04:59.758 --> 05:04.333
to find out how old Ben Gunn
got marooned on that island.

05:04.467 --> 05:06.872
- You think that's a good idea?
- Yeah.

05:07.008 --> 05:07.921
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

05:08.050 --> 05:10.006
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

05:10.134 --> 05:12.290
Okay.

05:26.969 --> 05:30.500
Well, we were afraid
you wouldn't come.

05:32.011 --> 05:36.254
- I caught a whiff of your barbecue.
- Oh.

05:36.387 --> 05:38.626
- After that--
- Yeah?

05:38.761 --> 05:40.883
I was, uh, helpless.

05:41.012 --> 05:43.927
All the way out in Galveston?

05:44.054 --> 05:46.128
- Somethin' like that.
- Mmm!

05:47.721 --> 05:50.292
It's his night, Deb.
I didn't want to spoil it.

05:50.429 --> 05:53.795
Spoil it? He has been
going crazy lookin' for you.

05:55.180 --> 05:59.009
Don't ever do that to me again.

05:59.139 --> 06:02.221
- How ya doin'?
- Hey. I'm doin' good.

06:02.348 --> 06:04.753
- Here.
- Thanks, man.

06:04.889 --> 06:07.010
A lot of people are gonna be
mighty glad to see ya, you know that?

06:07.140 --> 06:10.720
- Yeah.
- Come on. Let's go in.

06:10.849 --> 06:12.969
You remember him?

06:27.933 --> 06:29.474
- Come on.
- Why don't you just let that go?

06:29.684 --> 06:32.765
- As soon as you admit that
it was a no-go situation.
- It was a go situation.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.930
Three months, no data stream,
you're gonna land the ship anyway?

06:35.059 --> 06:37.015
Just because you keep bringing it up
doesn't make you right.

06:37.143 --> 06:39.466
Just because you get loud
doesn't make--Jim, settle it.

06:39.601 --> 06:41.308
- No, no, don't-- Don't look at me.
- Settle it.

06:41.435 --> 06:43.472
- It's a go situation.
- Well, th-- this is exactly
what I'm talkin' about.

06:43.601 --> 06:46.718
- It's hard to admit. I know that.
- Come on. Three commanders. One ship.

06:46.852 --> 06:48.392
I don't think that's gonna work.

06:48.518 --> 06:52.051
There's not enough rocket fuel in the
world to get those egos off the ground.

06:52.186 --> 06:56.594
- Come on.
- Ah, we would have made a great crew.

06:56.728 --> 07:00.888
- Maybe. If this man was left seat.
- Yep.

07:01.020 --> 07:03.805
Guys, come on. I'm a--
I'm a pretty good stick jockey.

07:03.937 --> 07:07.350
- You call me if you need a flight test.
- What is a-- What is a stick jockey?

07:07.479 --> 07:10.394
- ""I'm a pretty good stick jockey.""
- Come on, Mr Cover of Time Magazine.

07:10.521 --> 07:12.761
The guy who landed
a crippled Block II shuttle.

07:12.896 --> 07:15.183
- Yeah. That's the stick jockey.
- The stick jockey did that?

07:15.314 --> 07:17.470
- Yeah, yeah, Mr Stick Jockey.
- Okay, all right.

07:17.605 --> 07:20.473
I made a little noise, but
putting the first footprints on Mars?

07:20.606 --> 07:24.730
That's for guys who wrote their Ph.D.
thesis on how to colonize the place...

07:24.855 --> 07:29.892
and for guys who read too much
science fiction as a kid...

07:30.023 --> 07:32.938
- and still wear these little Flash
Gordon rocket ships around their necks.
- Yeah.

07:33.065 --> 07:36.846
- Very, very mature.
- Yeah, you read every damn
science fiction book I did.

07:36.982 --> 07:40.597
And you're just not man enough to wear
jewellery. That's all there is to that.

07:42.358 --> 07:44.313
- Give me it.
- No, no, no.
- Yeah. Take it. Get it.

07:44.441 --> 07:48.103
You know you want Flash here.
You ain't gettin' him! Oh, no!

07:48.233 --> 07:53.021
Yeah, Maggie would have loved to see
you two clowns just one more time.

08:09.860 --> 08:11.982
I'm gonna go and get a beer.

08:19.611 --> 08:22.942
I don't know, Woodrow.
I think it's about time
you donated this baby to the museum.

08:23.070 --> 08:27.147
Internal combustion, boys.
Accept no substitutes.

08:27.279 --> 08:29.648
Jim, listen.

08:31.488 --> 08:33.727
If there's, um--

08:33.863 --> 08:38.106
- If there's anything that Terri and I
can do, you call us, all right?
- I'm okay. I'm okay. Really.

08:38.239 --> 08:39.150
- All right.
- Thanks.

08:39.280 --> 08:40.821
- Luke.
- Yep.

08:40.947 --> 08:44.776
I'll see you when I get to Mars.
Listen. Don't solve all the mysteries
of the universe, all right?

08:44.906 --> 08:47.276
- Leave a little somethin'
for the next guys.
- I'm not promisin' anything.

08:47.406 --> 08:49.729
- You just bring some expensive beer.
- All right.

08:49.865 --> 08:52.946
- Will do. Godspeed.
- Thanks, buddy.

09:00.282 --> 09:03.067
It should have been your mission,Jim.

09:03.199 --> 09:05.273
Yours and Maggie's.

09:07.116 --> 09:10.731
Nobody ever wanted Mars
the way you two did, not even Woody.

09:10.866 --> 09:14.279
You two were 1 2 years training for
this thing, hoping for this assignment.

09:14.408 --> 09:17.111
- It's--
- Well, that's-- That's all over now.

09:17.242 --> 09:19.197
If Maggie hadn't gotten sick,
if you hadn't pulled yourself...

09:19.325 --> 09:21.282
out of the rotation
to take care of her, I mean, you--

09:21.410 --> 09:24.324
- Luke. Come on.
- No,Jim. Wait a minute.

09:24.451 --> 09:26.940
I want to say this.

09:27.076 --> 09:29.281
Look, I wanted
this assignment, all right?

09:31.327 --> 09:33.483
But not like this,Jim.

09:34.869 --> 09:38.449
I would give all of this up in a second
if it would bring Maggie back to us.

09:39.911 --> 09:43.075
I know that.

09:43.203 --> 09:47.777
Look, all the years
of training and planning
for this mission have been a privilege.

09:48.953 --> 09:51.869
Mars is yours now.

09:51.996 --> 09:54.116
Go get it.

09:54.245 --> 09:56.782
I will.

09:56.913 --> 09:59.911
You take care of yourself,Jim.

10:02.371 --> 10:05.204
You too, buddy.

10:05.330 --> 10:08.033
Okay.

10:08.164 --> 10:10.534
I'll see you when I get back.

10:12.081 --> 10:14.368
Hey, Luke.

10:15.831 --> 10:19.078
Have a great ride.

10:19.206 --> 10:22.323
Always do.

12:53.347 --> 12:56.132
- Luke, do you read me?
- Yeah, Reneé.

12:56.264 --> 12:58.635
Luke, I just got ARES-8 on-line, and--

12:58.765 --> 13:02.805
Well, we-- we think you're gonna
want to see this for yourself.

13:02.931 --> 13:04.887
Okay, copy that.

13:06.598 --> 13:08.720
- Now, is this a cinder cone?
- No, it's too smooth.

13:08.849 --> 13:12.132
It's, uh, too angular.
Volcanic upwelling maybe.

13:12.266 --> 13:16.889
- No, no fissure, no caldera.
- No, it's an upwelling for sure,
but maybe not volcanic.

13:17.017 --> 13:20.963
I mean, look at the colour and how shiny
it is. That almost looks like--

13:21.100 --> 13:24.182
- It looks like ice.
- This far south?

13:24.309 --> 13:27.011
Impossible. You can't have ice
at this latitude.

13:27.143 --> 13:29.631
I mean, not unless
there's like a--

13:33.309 --> 13:35.763
- Okay, how far away is that?
- Sixteen kilometres, northeast.

13:35.893 --> 13:37.848
Take us 20 minutes
to get there, Chief.

13:37.977 --> 13:40.513
Okay, we're gonna send a packet
to Micker. We're going out there.

13:40.644 --> 13:42.599
- Keep working.
- Okay.

13:54.437 --> 13:57.637
- Careful. Watch your step.
- Yes, sir.

13:57.770 --> 13:59.844
- Is it possible to take picture?
- Oh, picture.

13:59.978 --> 14:02.681
- Come, please.
- Let's have a picture.

14:02.812 --> 14:04.768
Say cheese.

14:06.521 --> 14:08.477
This is a truly
anomalous formation.

14:08.605 --> 14:10.928
It's unlike anything
ever seen so far.

14:11.063 --> 14:13.018
The structure appears
to be crystalline...

14:13.147 --> 14:15.636
at least from the angle
that's displayed by ARES-8.

14:15.772 --> 14:19.766
Now, we're trying not to go
too nuts up here, but we think
there's a good chance...

14:19.898 --> 14:23.513
that this could be an extrusion
from some subsurface
geothermal column of water.

14:23.648 --> 14:25.686
And, of course,
if that's correct...

14:25.815 --> 14:28.849
then we may have found the key
to permanent human colonization.

14:28.982 --> 14:32.513
- We think it wise to suspend judgement
here until we take our samples...
- Let geology and hydrology know...

14:32.649 --> 14:35.019
- and do a thorough investigation
of the area.
- we need to scramble on this,
full-court press.

14:35.149 --> 14:37.306
So we're gonna head out there ASAP
and take a look at this thing...

14:37.441 --> 14:39.680
try and get an idea
of its composition.

14:39.817 --> 14:42.684
By the time you receive this,
we should just about be on site.

15:13.528 --> 15:16.443
Anybody else hearing that?

15:16.570 --> 15:18.774
Yeah. What is it?

15:18.904 --> 15:23.064
I don't know. It sounds like, uh,
interference from the rover.

15:23.196 --> 15:27.439
- Can you fix it?
- Hey, Skip, I can fix anything.

15:27.571 --> 15:29.112
Love that modesty.

15:35.572 --> 15:39.352
Break out the radar.
Let's see what this thing's made of.

15:40.489 --> 15:42.775
Oh, yes, there's one more thing.

15:42.906 --> 15:46.817
Now, this is a very important,
very special day for a good friend
of ours back home.

15:46.948 --> 15:48.903
We know he's there right now.

15:49.031 --> 15:53.240
Now he hates it when anybody
makes any kind of a fuss about him,
so I'm not gonna mention his name.

15:53.366 --> 15:57.442
'Cause the last thing I would want
to do would be to embarrass
someone likejim McConnell!

15:58.782 --> 16:01.734
Was that loud?
Oh, well, it's done now.

16:01.866 --> 16:05.067
I mean, it can't be right. It says
there's metal under there. Solid metal.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.819
No, that doesn't make any sense.
You're reading a vein of ore, Reneé.

16:07.951 --> 16:10.948
No, it-- It says
it's under the whole mountain.

16:13.284 --> 16:16.199
All right. Move it closer, up the power,
and we're gonna try it again.

16:16.326 --> 16:21.778
- Hey!
- Happy birthday to you

16:21.910 --> 16:25.027
Happy birthday to you

16:25.160 --> 16:26.783
Okay, everybody, I want you
to take a look at jim.

16:26.910 --> 16:29.447
- Happy birthday, dearjim
- Now, is he all red
with one of those fake...

16:29.578 --> 16:31.533
""Oh, I'm-a-good-sport""grins
on his face?

16:31.661 --> 16:34.196
- Happy birthday to you
- That's right. Now, everybody,
take-- take a look at Ray.

16:34.328 --> 16:37.990
Does he have one of those
""This-wasn't-in-my-mission-plan""
looks on his face? Yeah.

16:38.120 --> 16:40.691
Uh-huh. Thought so. Well, there's
nothing you can do about it, Ray.

16:40.828 --> 16:43.282
We're a hundred million miles away!

16:43.412 --> 16:45.817
Okay, let's blow it out.

16:45.954 --> 16:48.656
- We're all set here, Chief.
- All right, let's crank up the juice...

16:48.787 --> 16:50.743
see what's in this sucker.

17:13.623 --> 17:15.993
What happened?

18:30.548 --> 18:32.504
Oh, my God!

18:35.090 --> 18:38.836
- You gettin' that, Sergei?
- Uh-huh.

19:28.971 --> 19:30.961
Oh, my God! Reneé!

19:40.222 --> 19:43.385
Oh! Oh, my God!
Oh,Jesus! Oh,Jesus!

20:48.978 --> 20:55.059
Problem: hatch door malfunction,
backup power fail, manual override fail.

20:55.188 --> 20:59.181
- Solution?
- Replace optical relay.

20:59.313 --> 21:02.311
Piece of cake. God,
who dreams up these nightmares?

21:02.438 --> 21:04.512
- Don't try to change the subject.
- I'm not.

21:04.646 --> 21:06.685
- We're talking about
your sister's wedding, right?
- No, we're talking about...

21:06.814 --> 21:09.053
- dancing lessons
before my sister's wedding.
- This is a nightmare.

21:09.189 --> 21:14.344
Do you mind? I'm in the middle of a
catastrophic power failure here. Check.

21:14.481 --> 21:16.472
- Not effective.
- Not effective?

21:16.607 --> 21:19.438
- Replace optical relay.
- You're distracting me.

21:19.564 --> 21:23.394
Woody, we're a married couple.
Would it kill you to invite me out
on the dance floor just once in a while?

21:23.524 --> 21:27.103
- We danced. We danced
at our wedding. We danced.
- No. That's not dancing, Woody.

21:27.232 --> 21:30.812
That's you shuffling your feet
around while you grab my butt.

21:30.941 --> 21:33.063
I'm talking about real dancing,
you know?

21:33.192 --> 21:36.806
Cha-cha-cha, rhumba, jitterbug.

21:36.942 --> 21:40.935
Darling, face it.
Some couples dance. Some go to Mars.

21:41.067 --> 21:43.188
That's life. Test.

21:44.901 --> 21:47.224
Effective. Yeah.
Woody, I'm serious.

21:47.359 --> 21:49.895
Just as soon as we get back home,
we're starting lessons.

21:50.026 --> 21:54.483
- Uh-huh.
- Woody, if we never dance, people
are gonna think there's something wrong.

21:54.611 --> 21:57.643
If they see me dance,
they'll know there's something wrong.

21:57.777 --> 22:00.348
This is highly unprofessional.

22:00.486 --> 22:03.982
- This is highly unprofessional, sir.
You keep forgetting that ""sir.""
- Sir.

22:04.111 --> 22:06.186
Cockpit, this is Control.

22:06.320 --> 22:09.401
- Cockpit, this is Control.
- Control, this is Cockpit.

22:09.529 --> 22:13.143
Yeah, Terri, it's Phil. They want us
all to report to Micker ASAP.

22:13.279 --> 22:17.273
- Who says to report to Micker?
- The little men who live in my head.

22:17.404 --> 22:22.559
Well, that's a negative, Phil.
We're in the middle of a catastrophic
power failure right now.

22:22.696 --> 22:27.354
Yeah, Woody, it was Ray Beck.
He told me to round up the team. Now.

22:27.488 --> 22:29.645
The exact same moment
that we lost the data stream...

22:29.781 --> 22:33.395
they picked up
this intense burst of energy from Mars.

22:33.531 --> 22:37.192
- What do you mean intense?
- Catastrophic.

22:39.490 --> 22:41.611
What about the crew?

22:41.740 --> 22:46.777
The level of energy in the pulse
didn't seem survivable.

22:46.907 --> 22:48.862
How about the REMO?

22:48.990 --> 22:51.610
It went into Mars' orbit last week.
Maybe it could give us some clue.

22:51.741 --> 22:54.110
That's just what we tried next.

22:54.242 --> 22:57.274
All right. The, uh,
resupply module checked out fine.

22:57.408 --> 23:01.900
No instrument failures. Orbit holding
steady, but there was something else.

23:02.033 --> 23:04.024
The REMO's computer
contained an uplink message--

23:04.158 --> 23:07.856
a very faint, highly distorted
transmission from Mars One base camp.

23:07.993 --> 23:11.405
- Someone's alive.
- Yes, yes, yes. Put up the message.

23:11.535 --> 23:14.403
Still concentrating on the audio,
but we've got a long way to go.

23:14.535 --> 23:17.818
Show us whatever you've got.
Show us.

23:22.619 --> 23:24.740
I have to make this--
make this fast.

23:26.369 --> 23:30.909
I may not get another chance to--
to make-- another chance-- chance--

23:31.037 --> 23:33.739
to the site-- site.

23:33.870 --> 23:36.821
There was a low sound that--

23:36.953 --> 23:39.656
a low sound-- sound--
a low sound--

23:39.787 --> 23:42.620
Something came out of the top
of the mountain, and it hit us.

23:42.746 --> 23:45.698
And-- it hit us-- it hit us.

23:47.079 --> 23:49.118
Oh, my God!

23:50.288 --> 23:52.991
They're dead.

23:53.122 --> 23:56.737
God! Nick-- Man! They're dead.

23:56.872 --> 23:58.827
That's it.

24:01.498 --> 24:03.987
I don't know.
Luke must be in pretty bad shape...

24:04.124 --> 24:07.324
if he hasn't just blasted out of there
in the Earth Return Vehicle.

24:07.457 --> 24:10.823
That thing's designed so even one
crew member can fly it back to Earth.

24:10.957 --> 24:13.280
Even if Luke was in great shape,
he couldn't get home.

24:13.416 --> 24:16.367
An energy pulse of that magnitude
would have fried the ERV's computers.

24:16.499 --> 24:18.573
Other than the computers,
how do we think the ERV fared?

24:18.708 --> 24:21.457
Well, so far, our modelling says
it should be in pretty good shape.

24:21.583 --> 24:23.574
Which means it's gonna be up to us
to get new motherboards...

24:23.708 --> 24:26.162
drives and software to Mars
as fast as we can.

24:26.292 --> 24:28.413
- Right.
- Slow it down. Slow it down.
Slow it down.

24:28.542 --> 24:31.457
It's gonna take us weeks
just to analyse this data.

24:31.584 --> 24:35.281
Right, right, but in the meantime,
we gotta be workin' up a mission plan.

24:35.417 --> 24:39.364
- Luke needs us now.
- Luke may already be dead.

24:39.502 --> 24:43.163
And even if he's not, it's doubtful he
is going to be able to transmit again.

24:43.294 --> 24:47.998
So we wouldn't know
whether it's safe to land...

24:48.127 --> 24:50.699
until we were almost there.

25:00.379 --> 25:02.583
What about SIMA?

25:02.712 --> 25:06.493
What about SIMA?
The Saturn imaging probe?

25:06.629 --> 25:08.870
It's gonna slingshot around Mars
on its way through the solar system.

25:09.005 --> 25:12.536
It could be retasked
to take pictures, read radiation
levels of Mars One base camp.

25:12.672 --> 25:15.623
Wait, wait, wait.
We are getting ahead of ourselves.

25:15.756 --> 25:19.879
You are forgetting the bigger problem.
The orbits are all wrong.

25:20.005 --> 25:23.004
Our first decent launch window
is almost eight months from now.

25:23.131 --> 25:25.371
Yes, but we can go earlier
and get there faster...

25:25.507 --> 25:27.462
if we reconfigure the payload
for extra fuel.

25:27.590 --> 25:29.913
We've modelled that, Ray.
I've modelled it.

25:30.048 --> 25:33.746
On paper, yes, but those stresses
have never been tested in space.

25:33.882 --> 25:37.711
- The ship can take it.
- Oh, ""ship can take it.""

25:37.841 --> 25:40.080
I wasn't thinking of just the ship.

25:43.967 --> 25:47.795
Ray, I know the protocols for a Mars
recovery mission better than anybody...

25:47.925 --> 25:51.007
because I designed them.

25:51.134 --> 25:53.290
And I'm telling you,
these guys can do it.

25:53.426 --> 25:56.542
He's right, Ray.
We got a real shot here.

26:05.177 --> 26:09.550
Well, give me an updated
mission plan by 0800 tomorrow.

26:09.677 --> 26:12.794
You'll have it by 0600.
Let's go to work.

26:16.095 --> 26:20.136
- Chief, can I have a word?
- Yeah, go ahead.

26:22.304 --> 26:25.919
- I no longer have the right crew.
- How do you mean?

26:26.054 --> 26:28.543
Bjornstrom can be up here
on the next shuttle.

26:28.680 --> 26:30.884
Bjornstrom is a geologist.
He's good, but not for this.

26:31.013 --> 26:32.968
My people just lost
eight months of training.

26:33.096 --> 26:35.218
This is a different mission
with a different objective.

26:35.347 --> 26:37.965
- I haven't approved the mission yet.
- Yes, but when you do...

26:38.097 --> 26:41.048
it ought to be given
its best chance for success.

26:43.265 --> 26:45.670
I want McConnell to fly right seat.

26:45.806 --> 26:47.843
Oh.

26:50.099 --> 26:52.930
Jim McConnell is
no longer on mission status.

26:53.056 --> 26:56.754
- Yeah, because you washed him out.
- He washed himself out.

26:56.891 --> 27:00.221
He only had to pass
a few more psych evaluations...

27:00.349 --> 27:03.680
but he refused to take them.

27:03.808 --> 27:07.672
His wife was dead. He didn't want to lay
on a couch and share it with strangers.

27:07.808 --> 27:10.890
Yeah, that was his call,
but I had to make one too!

27:11.017 --> 27:13.553
It was tough as hell,
but I'd do it again!

27:13.684 --> 27:16.255
For Christ's sake, Ray,
she wasted away in front of his eyes.

27:16.393 --> 27:19.474
What was he supposed to do, suck it up?
Get with the programme?

27:19.601 --> 27:21.924
What was his crime? That he--
That he showed a little emotion?

27:22.060 --> 27:25.177
I couldn't trust him!

27:25.310 --> 27:28.557
When Maggie died,
it knocked the hell out of him.

27:28.685 --> 27:31.221
It knocked the hell
out of all of us.

27:31.353 --> 27:33.676
But you know and I know
he's still the best we got.

27:33.811 --> 27:35.766
He and Maggie
wrote the book on Mars.

27:35.894 --> 27:38.466
He's had more hours in the sims
than the rest of us put together.

27:38.603 --> 27:40.594
We can do this, Ray.

27:40.728 --> 27:43.845
You give me McConnell as copilot,
and we will bring Luke home.

27:43.978 --> 27:45.934
It's a promise.

28:38.526 --> 28:42.602
Hey. What's that?

28:42.735 --> 28:48.814
That is the exact genetic composition
of my ideal woman.

28:54.903 --> 28:57.142
Hey, hey, hey. Hey!

28:59.111 --> 29:01.268
My baby.

29:02.695 --> 29:06.559
- Now what is it?
- A frog?

29:18.405 --> 29:22.066
- Hey, Skip.
- Hey. Take a look.

29:25.239 --> 29:27.194
Damn.

29:27.322 --> 29:31.364
- What do you make of that?
- Dust storm.

29:31.490 --> 29:33.694
Southern hemisphere,
comin' from the east.

29:33.823 --> 29:35.779
It's a big fella too.

29:35.907 --> 29:38.904
-Headed straight for Mars One base camp.
-Yep.

29:39.031 --> 29:41.153
Could get a little hairy
right about landing time.

29:41.282 --> 29:43.237
Yeah.

29:43.366 --> 29:47.691
Listen, we're gonna have to be able to
move fast, maybe even advance our ETA.

29:47.825 --> 29:51.486
These bad boys can cover a whole planet
and last up to a year.

29:51.616 --> 29:55.361
- When does SIMA do her fly-by?
- Tomorrow morning, 0600.

29:55.491 --> 29:59.154
That's when we find out whether
we've come all this way for nothin'.

30:01.159 --> 30:03.315
My money's on Luke.

30:28.245 --> 30:32.287
Have you seen her
so fine and pretty

30:32.413 --> 30:35.577
Fooled me with her style and ease

30:35.705 --> 30:39.284
And I feel her
from across the room

30:39.413 --> 30:43.988
Yes, it's love
in the third degree

30:44.122 --> 30:47.204
Ooh, baby, baby

30:47.331 --> 30:51.703
Won't ya turn your head my way

30:51.831 --> 30:54.615
Ooh, baby, baby

30:54.748 --> 30:58.528
Come on, take a chance
You're old enough to

30:58.664 --> 31:01.201
Dance

31:01.332 --> 31:03.287
The night away

31:05.290 --> 31:08.205
Whoa

31:08.332 --> 31:10.868
Dance the night away

31:12.958 --> 31:16.738
A live wire, barely a beginner

31:16.875 --> 31:20.205
But just watch that lady go

31:20.334 --> 31:24.280
She's on fire 'cause
dancin'gets her higher

31:24.417 --> 31:28.791
Than anything else she knows

31:28.918 --> 31:31.832
Ooh, baby, baby

31:31.960 --> 31:36.203
Won't ya turn your head my way

31:36.335 --> 31:39.417
Ooh, baby, baby

31:39.544 --> 31:42.827
All those interested in dance lessons,
please report to the promenade deck.

31:43.628 --> 31:47.574
Dance the night away

31:49.795 --> 31:52.912
Whoa

31:53.045 --> 31:56.577
Dance the night away

31:58.379 --> 32:01.128
Oh

32:01.254 --> 32:04.537
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

32:23.382 --> 32:25.337
And what, may I ask,
brought this on?

32:25.466 --> 32:29.376
Zero G, my friend.
My last chance to be graceful.

32:29.507 --> 32:34.627
Once we're in Mars' gravity,
it's back to shufflin' my feet
and grabbin' her butt.

32:34.758 --> 32:39.462
Dance the night away

32:39.591 --> 32:42.294
Oh, baby

32:42.425 --> 32:47.249
Dance, dance, dance
the night away

32:48.635 --> 32:51.752
Oh, come on, dance

32:51.885 --> 32:53.840
- The night away
- Incoming packet.

32:53.968 --> 32:56.421
- Oh, baby
- Incoming packet.

32:56.552 --> 32:59.798
- Dance
- It's SIMA.

33:01.844 --> 33:03.123
Enhanced look at base camp.

33:06.011 --> 33:07.966
- Looks deserted.
- It's still standing, though.

33:08.094 --> 33:10.879
So's the ERV. And, look,
there's the greenhouse.

33:11.011 --> 33:16.048
Well, we know Luke survived
for at least a few hours.

33:16.178 --> 33:19.960
Now, are there any signs
of recent activity?

33:20.096 --> 33:23.793
There. Scan northeastern quadrant
of base camp.

33:26.013 --> 33:27.968
What the hell are those?

33:30.638 --> 33:34.004
- Graves.
- Wait a minute.
There's only three of them.

33:34.139 --> 33:36.841
- That means that Luke's still gotta be
alive. It means he's still down there.
- Phil, no, no.

33:36.973 --> 33:40.883
It just means there was
no one left to bury him.

33:41.014 --> 33:43.883
- Check the radiation levels.
- Check rad levels.

33:44.807 --> 33:46.133
Normal.

33:46.265 --> 33:49.880
- Go to disaster site.
- Go to 41 by 9.

33:53.558 --> 33:55.548
- What's wrong?
- I don't know. Magnetic interference?

33:55.683 --> 33:57.803
- Go infrared.
- Switch to infrared.

34:00.267 --> 34:02.636
It's gotta be
a problem with SIMA.

34:02.766 --> 34:07.389
I don't see how an earthquake six months
ago could cause this kind of distortion.

34:07.517 --> 34:09.472
That was no quake.

34:33.603 --> 34:36.092
We are going to continue
analysing this data...

34:36.228 --> 34:39.926
and try to determine
what the problem is with those images.

34:40.062 --> 34:44.850
We agree that the evidence
of the graves is, uh...

34:44.978 --> 34:46.935
inconclusive...

34:47.063 --> 34:50.973
and that a ground search
is advisable.

34:51.105 --> 34:55.762
Frankly, we are as stumped
as you guys, but we'll keep on it.

34:55.897 --> 34:58.351
Beware there are little
sandstorms kicking up...

34:58.481 --> 35:01.763
- Bureau babble.
- near Mars One base.

35:01.898 --> 35:04.683
But the big one
you spotted is turning south.

35:04.815 --> 35:06.770
It shouldn't be a factor.

35:06.898 --> 35:10.643
We are pretty excited around here.

35:10.773 --> 35:13.725
Well, and we are sure
you must be feeling the same.

35:13.857 --> 35:17.021
- Enjoy your meal and
get a good night's sleep.
- Say it.

35:17.149 --> 35:19.768
- We anticipate...
- Say it.

35:19.900 --> 35:22.470
- that tomorrow morning...
- Say it.

35:22.609 --> 35:24.765
you will be go.

35:24.900 --> 35:29.724
Yes! Yes!
Thank you! Thank you!

35:46.069 --> 35:48.439
Hooray for baby jimmy!

35:48.569 --> 35:51.769
Yes, jim's first spaceship
was seriously underpowered.

35:51.903 --> 35:53.940
Maggie was always
a little star-struck.

35:56.237 --> 35:58.192
Come on.
Show us those beautiful teeth.

36:00.362 --> 36:03.858
I am gonna get you guys for that!
I am gonna get you.

36:03.988 --> 36:06.274
When they met at the Air Force Academy,
it was love at first flight.

36:06.404 --> 36:09.438
- Woody's line. Woody's line.
- Oh.

36:09.571 --> 36:11.645
Later, during NASA training,
things got a little tough.

36:11.780 --> 36:16.070
Yes, Maggie always did
keep jim on a short leash.

36:16.197 --> 36:19.528
jim was always trying
to explore a heavenly body.

36:19.656 --> 36:21.196
- Right.
-Ah, yes.

36:21.322 --> 36:24.191
- Well, where are they goin'?
Where are they goin'?
- Ten-thousand-mile-high club.

36:24.323 --> 36:26.609
- That's right.
- Until--

36:27.823 --> 36:29.778
- Mission accomplished.
- Oh!

36:29.906 --> 36:33.687
Man, what a fun wedding.
I was so whacked.

36:33.823 --> 36:37.604
Uh, I'm going in.
T-minus three, T-minus two...

36:37.741 --> 36:39.980
T-minus one, contact.

36:40.116 --> 36:42.984
Oh. Okay, we can stop it there.

36:43.116 --> 36:45.071
Stop there. Fast forward.

36:45.199 --> 36:47.736
-All right.
-And then what happened?

36:47.867 --> 36:50.616
I-- I know what happened.

36:50.742 --> 36:54.274
- What nerves.
- Okay, you guys.

36:54.409 --> 36:58.320
They're adding a wonderful chapter
to their incredible story...

36:58.451 --> 37:00.407
and it's a pretty historic one.

37:00.535 --> 37:03.735
To the newly appointed co-commanders
of Mars One, jim and Maggie!

37:03.869 --> 37:06.238
- Hear, hear.
- I will drink to that.

37:06.368 --> 37:07.992
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

37:08.119 --> 37:10.074
- Hold it. It's not over.
- Show 'em. Show 'em. Show 'em.

37:10.202 --> 37:11.778
- Yeah, we got a little--
a little addendum.
- Oh, yeah, this is good.

37:11.910 --> 37:14.281
- Check this out, guys.
- Here we go. It's Phil's best work.

37:14.411 --> 37:18.904
- Oh, yeah.
- Look! It's Mars!

37:19.037 --> 37:22.568
You can pick up these postcards
at your local NASA souvenir shop.

37:22.704 --> 37:25.073
You know, when you two land up there,
it will prove once and for all...

37:25.203 --> 37:28.819
that there really is
no intelligent life on Mars.

37:28.954 --> 37:30.613
-All right. Enough, enough.
- Thanks a lot. Touché.

37:30.746 --> 37:32.287
- You're gonna eat those words.
- I don't think so.

37:32.413 --> 37:33.906
- Everett, give me the camera.
-All right.
- I don't think so.
- Uh-oh, here we go.

37:34.038 --> 37:36.112
- Let me take it away.
- What? What if I'm right?
- Here we go.

37:36.246 --> 37:38.202
- What if she's right?
- Why does it have to be about us?

37:38.330 --> 37:40.784
- You okay?
- Why can't it just be about science?
- Yes.

37:40.914 --> 37:43.747
- We'll do the science,
and we'll do it really well...
- Yeah.

37:43.873 --> 37:45.828
because that's
what we've trained for.

37:45.956 --> 37:48.444
But what if there's more?
In all our myths...

37:48.582 --> 37:52.990
in every human culture, Mars has
always held a special attraction.

37:55.123 --> 37:58.620
I mean, what if
that means something?

37:58.749 --> 38:03.454
The universe is-- is not chaos.
It's connection.

38:03.583 --> 38:08.075
Life reaches out for life.

38:08.208 --> 38:10.246
That's what we were born for,
isn't it?

38:10.375 --> 38:14.369
To stand on a new world
and look beyond it to the next one.

38:16.918 --> 38:18.908
It's who we are.

38:28.960 --> 38:30.916
You know, she may have been right.

38:33.919 --> 38:37.415
If that wasn't a quake down there,
then something else caused it...

38:37.544 --> 38:40.460
or planned it.

38:40.587 --> 38:43.075
You thinkin' the same thing?

38:45.670 --> 38:48.290
It's never been out of my mind.

38:53.255 --> 38:55.578
I think she knew something, Woody.

38:58.129 --> 39:00.287
She was the only one of us
who ever really believed...

39:00.422 --> 39:03.207
there might be
something down there.

39:05.381 --> 39:09.588
Yeah, well, we're not leaving
until we find out. Deal?

39:11.965 --> 39:13.506
Deal.

39:17.923 --> 39:21.087
Range: 67-83 and closing.

39:21.215 --> 39:23.965
65 minutes until
Mars orbital capture.

39:24.091 --> 39:27.503
Okay, people, let's look sharp now.
We're gonna run this simulation
one more time.

39:27.633 --> 39:30.797
Remember, if we overshoot,
there's no comin' back.

39:30.925 --> 39:34.504
Yeah, and drifting through eternity
will ruin your whole day.

39:34.633 --> 39:37.964
Okay, Delta-V systems initialized.

39:38.093 --> 39:40.546
Charge primary APU.

39:40.676 --> 39:42.750
Engaged and charged.

39:42.884 --> 39:47.956
- Select HPU fuel cells for run.
- Engaged.

39:48.094 --> 39:51.341
- Tie main bus to systems.
- Power ready.

39:51.469 --> 39:54.752
Select H2O2 HPU
and fuel cells for open.

39:54.886 --> 39:58.832
H2O2 fuel valves open.

39:58.969 --> 40:01.007
Charge flow.

40:01.136 --> 40:03.341
Charged and on-line.

40:03.470 --> 40:06.338
- Reset PW.
- Set.

40:06.470 --> 40:09.753
Transfer protocol data
from EVA station.

40:09.887 --> 40:14.343
Transferred.
Awaiting track confirmation.

40:15.429 --> 40:18.001
Jesus! Oh!

40:21.680 --> 40:23.884
Micrometeoroids.

40:30.431 --> 40:32.421
Kill those alarms!

40:40.973 --> 40:45.347
Critical systems alert.
Critical systems alert.

40:45.474 --> 40:48.556
- Breach hits in the hull.
- We're outgassing, losing pressure.

40:48.683 --> 40:52.926
Woody, seal the breach.
Looks like it's behind Jim's helmet.

40:55.516 --> 40:58.847
Ninety percent atmosphere.

41:12.644 --> 41:16.969
Critical systems alert.
Critical systems alert.

41:25.311 --> 41:27.682
We're losing pressure fast.
We're gonna decompress!

41:31.021 --> 41:32.976
Computer, how long
till zero atmosphere?

41:34.646 --> 41:37.015
Four minutes, nine seconds.

41:39.021 --> 41:40.977
We're still outgassing
in the lower hab.

41:41.105 --> 41:44.435
There must be another hole down there.
It's gotta be a big one.

41:44.564 --> 41:46.969
Everybody switch to suit oxygen.
Jim, you've got the ship.

41:47.105 --> 41:49.097
- I'm going EVA.
- Copy.

41:49.231 --> 41:51.056
Come on, people.
Let's work the problem.

41:57.231 --> 41:59.637
Eighty percent atmosphere.

41:59.773 --> 42:02.558
Jim, you got to go get
your spare helmet.

42:05.315 --> 42:07.390
Copy that,Jim?

42:07.524 --> 42:11.849
There's no time.
All the systems have crashed.

42:11.982 --> 42:14.223
I gotta shut down the hab
from below.

42:14.358 --> 42:18.269
We're losing pressure,Jim.
You could embolize.

42:33.776 --> 42:36.691
Seventy percent atmosphere.

42:49.695 --> 42:52.859
Phil, you've got to get
the nav computers back on-line.

42:52.987 --> 42:55.108
Uh,Jim, I've got an idea.

42:55.237 --> 42:57.275
If you guys can save
enough atmosphere...

42:57.404 --> 43:00.687
I'll disconnect the power in the main
computer bay and jump-start the systems.

43:00.821 --> 43:04.518
- I'd basically be doing a hard boot.
- Has that been tested?

43:04.655 --> 43:09.727
Are you kidding?
These machines are way too expensive.

43:09.863 --> 43:14.486
- Do it.
- Okay. I think this will work.

43:18.614 --> 43:21.447
Sixty percent atmosphere.

44:00.827 --> 44:05.450
-Jim, how we doing on the AG?
-Just hang on one second, Woody.

44:05.578 --> 44:08.066
- Fifty percent atmosphere.
- Come on.

44:08.202 --> 44:10.360
- Come on.
-Jim, I've got oxygen.

44:10.495 --> 44:14.536
- Come on.
- Voice print identification.

44:14.661 --> 44:17.115
- Mc-- McCon--
- Not accepted.

44:17.246 --> 44:19.781
Voice print identification.

44:19.912 --> 44:22.531
- McConnell!
- Accepted.

44:22.662 --> 44:25.330
Shut down gravitational rotation.

44:25.455 --> 44:28.025
Shutting down artificial
gravitational rotation.

44:34.872 --> 44:36.495
Jim, I've got the oxygen for you.

44:39.831 --> 44:42.829
- Hang on!
- Forty percent atmosphere.

44:47.040 --> 44:51.663
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

44:51.791 --> 44:56.365
- I'm topside,Jim.
Do you know which sector?
- I'm working on it.

44:56.499 --> 45:00.115
- You better get some oxygen,Jim.
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

45:09.876 --> 45:11.203
Come on.

45:13.918 --> 45:16.240
Jesus.

45:16.376 --> 45:18.616
It's like lookin' for a needle
in a haystack.

45:18.752 --> 45:21.667
Okay, come on.

45:21.794 --> 45:24.282
Come on. Where are you,
you little bastard?

45:24.418 --> 45:26.908
Give me some light on the hull
so I can locate it.

45:27.044 --> 45:29.579
I got a better idea.

45:34.461 --> 45:36.832
Gotcha.

45:36.962 --> 45:40.541
Terri.

45:40.670 --> 45:43.041
Squeeze out the liquid.

45:44.295 --> 45:46.666
S-Stay there.

45:46.796 --> 45:49.249
- Squeeze it out.
-Jim.

45:49.379 --> 45:53.836
Okay. Okay. Please work.

46:00.672 --> 46:03.078
Thirty percent atmosphere.

46:06.673 --> 46:10.501
Woody, the breach is between
sectors five and six.

46:11.632 --> 46:16.255
- Five and six. Do you copy?
- Copy. I'm headin'there now.

46:18.633 --> 46:21.999
Son of a bitch.
You never did that in a simulator.

46:22.133 --> 46:28.047
- Twenty percent atmosphere.
- Jim?

46:36.176 --> 46:41.877
- Ten percent atmosphere.
- Jim!

46:44.802 --> 46:48.334
Jim, talk to me. It's Terri.

46:53.095 --> 46:55.583
-Jim.
- Come back.

46:55.719 --> 46:57.794
- Breathe!
- Come back!

46:59.554 --> 47:01.544
Gotcha.

47:03.179 --> 47:06.426
Pressure stabilizing.
Pressure stabilizing.

47:08.388 --> 47:11.967
-Jim?
- Twenty percent atmosphere.

47:14.514 --> 47:17.002
Hi. Welcome back.

47:17.138 --> 47:19.971
Thirty percent atmosphere.

47:21.139 --> 47:24.256
It worked! Yes! It worked!

47:24.390 --> 47:27.091
Way to go, everybody.
All right! Yeah!

47:30.181 --> 47:32.931
There's a lot of scarring out here.
I'm gonna check for other punctures.

47:33.057 --> 47:38.094
Orbital insertion proximity alert.
Orbital insertion proximity alert.

47:38.224 --> 47:41.057
Negative, Woody. That is a negative.
You have to get back inside.

47:41.183 --> 47:43.588
We have to do our checklist
for orbital insertion.

47:43.724 --> 47:45.679
Copy. I'm on my way.

47:48.683 --> 47:50.721
Hello, beautiful.

48:25.896 --> 48:29.972
Prepare to initiate burn.
Prepare to initiate burn.

48:30.104 --> 48:32.344
Okay, we're ready
to light this candle.

48:32.480 --> 48:35.846
Go/No go for braking burn
and MOI.

48:35.980 --> 48:37.935
- Engines.
- On-line.

48:38.063 --> 48:39.686
Go.

48:39.813 --> 48:41.141
- Systems.
- On-line.

48:41.272 --> 48:42.267
Go.

48:42.397 --> 48:43.974
- Nav.
- On-line.

48:44.106 --> 48:46.013
- Go.
- We are go for the burn.

48:46.148 --> 48:47.889
I am fuelling engines.

48:48.023 --> 48:51.554
Flow charger on-line.
Flow charger activated.

49:00.024 --> 49:03.638
Optimum angle of entry
in minus seven degrees.

49:03.774 --> 49:07.187
Countdown to initiate burn
for orbital insertion.

49:09.317 --> 49:11.390
Six.

49:15.067 --> 49:16.394
Five.

49:19.567 --> 49:22.187
Orbital insertion
proximity alert.

49:22.318 --> 49:25.269
- Four.
- Optimum insertion angle approaching.

49:25.402 --> 49:27.558
Jim?

49:27.693 --> 49:29.021
Three.

49:34.486 --> 49:37.519
Optimum insertion angle imminent.

49:39.819 --> 49:40.981
Two.

49:44.903 --> 49:47.522
- One.
- Let's go to Mars.

49:52.113 --> 49:53.570
Jesus!

49:56.196 --> 49:59.396
-Attitude incorrect.
- Shut down the engines.

50:02.780 --> 50:07.272
Engines negative. No response.
I have got no attitude control.

50:07.406 --> 50:09.859
- Manual separation. Blow the bolts.
- Negative. The control module...

50:09.989 --> 50:12.027
doesn't have enough thrust
to correct this rotation.

50:12.156 --> 50:14.988
We're too steep.
We're falling into the atmosphere.

50:15.114 --> 50:17.070
Christ, at this angle,
we're gonna burn up.

50:19.407 --> 50:22.441
- How much time we got, Phil?
- I don't know. Three minutes?
I don't know.

50:22.574 --> 50:25.525
- Where's the REMO?
- The resupply module? Why? There's
no way we're gonna be able to link up.

50:25.658 --> 50:27.731
Where is it?

50:27.866 --> 50:32.240
Resupply module located.
Resupply module located.

50:32.367 --> 50:33.481
- It's close.
- How close?

50:33.617 --> 50:35.691
- I don't know.
That's gonna take some time.
- Figure it out.

50:35.825 --> 50:37.401
We don't have time, Phil.
Figure it out now.

50:37.534 --> 50:39.856
Jim, we're dead stick. There's no way
to manoeuvre this ship into linkup.

50:42.617 --> 50:46.314
Not the ship.Just us.
We go EVA.

50:46.451 --> 50:49.449
- You want us to transfer in suits?
-Jesus,Jim, if we don't make it--

50:49.576 --> 50:51.781
- If we miss the REMO--
- There's no other choice.

50:51.910 --> 50:55.406
- Phil, how close?
- Intersection orbit with REMO.

50:56.577 --> 50:59.244
Course intersection plotted.

50:59.369 --> 51:02.119
One kilometre.
That's the best I can do.

51:03.161 --> 51:05.615
Prepare to abandon ship.

51:06.829 --> 51:08.784
Let's go!

52:19.294 --> 52:21.913
- What are you looking for?
- Earth.

52:23.919 --> 52:28.909
Hey, when we get back home, we really
will have to try this out in the sim.

52:30.128 --> 52:32.795
How we doing on the fuel, Woody?

52:32.921 --> 52:36.535
I'm at 50 percent.
I don't see the REMO.

53:02.799 --> 53:05.547
There it is.
Forty-five left, forty-five down.

53:05.673 --> 53:08.079
Oh,Jesus. She's not
where I thought she'd be.

53:08.216 --> 53:10.538
- We're gonna miss her.
- What do you think?

53:11.716 --> 53:14.750
We can't catch it.
Not like this.

53:14.883 --> 53:18.414
Use the tether. You'll have one, maybe
two shots before she's out of reach.

53:18.550 --> 53:21.039
Negative. It's too risky.
If we miss her, we got nothing.

53:22.383 --> 53:25.216
I'll leave you the gun.
Run a line out to the REMO.

53:25.342 --> 53:28.092
I got enough fuel left for that.

53:28.218 --> 53:30.836
- You'll be going too fast.
- I'll aim to overshoot.

53:32.677 --> 53:36.505
Brake like hell and arc it in.
Piece of cake.

53:38.927 --> 53:40.883
I'll see you in a flash.

53:47.386 --> 53:50.337
Unhook me.

53:50.469 --> 53:52.508
Good to go.

54:11.847 --> 54:16.055
Okay, I'm on a path to overshoot.
I'm gonna take the edge off.

54:23.348 --> 54:27.556
I'm out of fuel.
Coming in hot. Still long.

54:33.975 --> 54:36.380
Abandoning the unit.
I'll break with suit jets.

54:41.392 --> 54:44.059
Jesus.Jesus.

54:49.976 --> 54:52.595
Suit jets gone.
I'm gonna make contact.

54:53.684 --> 54:56.848
- What velocity?
- Impact's gonna be a little rough.

54:56.976 --> 54:58.718
- At what velocity?
- Thirty-two.

55:02.894 --> 55:04.884
- I'm gonna use the gun to slow you.
- No.

55:05.019 --> 55:07.056
- If you slow me, I'll fall short.
- It's too fast, Woody.

55:07.186 --> 55:10.432
No choice. I'll be okay.
Here we go!

55:12.270 --> 55:13.893
Gotcha.

55:14.020 --> 55:15.727
Woody!

55:17.854 --> 55:19.679
Woody!

55:21.895 --> 55:24.100
Woody! Woody!

55:24.229 --> 55:26.469
Woody. Woody.

55:26.604 --> 55:29.686
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Woody. Woody.

55:34.730 --> 55:36.436
- Terri.
- Woody.

55:36.564 --> 55:39.313
Take the gun. Take it.

55:40.981 --> 55:43.766
Phil, hang on. Go.

55:51.690 --> 55:53.480
Woody, what's your status?

55:53.608 --> 55:58.977
Well, uh, my suit jets are gone, and I'm
still carrying a good deal of velocity.

55:59.108 --> 56:01.477
Soon as we get hooked up,
I'll come get you.

56:01.608 --> 56:04.559
- I'd have to say negative on that,Jim.
- Negative on the transmission?

56:04.691 --> 56:08.104
No, I heard you. Negative on the
manoeuvre. I am not retrievable.

56:08.233 --> 56:11.599
- Woody, you're not going that fast.
- Well, it all comes down
to the amount of fuel, honey.

56:11.734 --> 56:14.602
Suit jets are designed
for attitude control, not travel.

56:14.734 --> 56:17.401
- Retrieval just won't work.
- Well, it's gotta work.

56:17.526 --> 56:20.478
Hey, listen. I don't like it
any more than you do.

56:20.610 --> 56:22.933
- Woody.
- Run the numbers,Jim.

56:23.068 --> 56:25.023
I am.

56:29.777 --> 56:31.519
You hang tight, Woody.

56:31.652 --> 56:33.976
We'll get in the REMO, drop her down
and come scoop you up.

56:34.111 --> 56:38.105
- Sounds good,Jim.
- It's gonna take us half an hour
to get the REMO reoriented.

56:38.236 --> 56:40.192
Woody will be
in the atmosphere by then.

56:40.320 --> 56:43.521
- Then we'll just have to
get her moving faster.
- We don't have time.

56:43.654 --> 56:45.728
Listen to Jim, honey.
It's a good plan.

56:45.862 --> 56:49.477
No. We're gonna come get you.

56:52.363 --> 56:54.401
- Okay. Get ready for brakes.
- Come on, now.

56:54.530 --> 56:55.987
- On my mark. Three...
- You can do it.

56:56.113 --> 56:57.488
- two...
- You can do it!
- one.

56:57.613 --> 56:59.687
- Come on!
- Mark!
- Come on!

57:01.322 --> 57:02.566
Yeah!

57:02.697 --> 57:04.688
Yeah!

57:06.239 --> 57:08.396
- Everybody good?
- We're on,Jim.

57:10.240 --> 57:11.568
Way to go. Way to go.

57:13.574 --> 57:15.529
Good job.

57:15.657 --> 57:18.145
All right. There won't be
enough room for us inside.

57:19.866 --> 57:22.189
Soon as I get the hatch open,
let's start dumping the cargo.

57:22.324 --> 57:24.149
- Copy that.
- Hang on, Woody.

57:24.283 --> 57:26.238
Will do,Jim.

57:33.701 --> 57:35.277
Hello, beautiful.

57:39.201 --> 57:41.238
Come on.

57:41.368 --> 57:43.406
All right. It's open.

57:47.618 --> 57:50.403
- Terri, no!
- Terri! Come back!

57:52.077 --> 57:53.618
You'll never make it!

57:53.744 --> 57:57.406
- Terri, what are you doing?
- I'll tell you
what I'm not doing, Woody.

57:57.536 --> 58:00.534
- I'm not gonna watch you die.
- Terri.

58:00.662 --> 58:02.487
You'd do the same for me.

58:02.620 --> 58:05.902
Phil, get inside, dump the cargo
and start the systems. Now!

58:06.037 --> 58:08.870
- No, I wouldn't.
Not if it was impossible.
- I can do it!

58:08.996 --> 58:12.326
No, you can't. You don't have enough
fuel to come get me and get us back.

58:14.579 --> 58:17.578
Listen to me, goddamn it. You have
to stop, and you have to stop now.

58:17.705 --> 58:20.952
He's right, Terri.
It's no use.

58:36.665 --> 58:38.040
Okay, honey.

58:41.249 --> 58:43.370
You gotta go back now.

58:45.333 --> 58:47.489
The hell I do.

59:27.378 --> 59:30.163
What are you doing?

59:30.296 --> 59:33.164
I'm gonna jet in a little closer
and try again.

59:33.296 --> 59:36.413
Terri, you spend any fuel
getting closer, you won't get back.

59:36.546 --> 59:38.833
And if anyone tries to get you,
they'll die too.

59:41.047 --> 59:44.045
Honey, please.
Please go back.

59:46.214 --> 59:48.252
Go back and help the others
to the surface.

59:50.048 --> 59:51.706
I am not losing you!

59:53.131 --> 59:55.252
I can't let you do it.

59:55.381 --> 59:58.996
- I can't let you die. I'm sorry.
- Woody.

59:59.131 --> 01:00:01.170
What are you doing?

01:00:01.299 --> 01:00:03.089
- Love you, honey.
- Woody--

01:00:03.216 --> 01:00:06.167
No. No!

01:00:06.299 --> 01:00:09.630
- God, how I love you.
- Woody! Don't!

01:00:10.842 --> 01:00:14.172
Woody! Woody!

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:18.792
Woody! Don't! No!

01:00:21.426 --> 01:00:25.254
No! Please, God, no!

01:00:30.093 --> 01:00:32.547
Woody.

01:00:35.719 --> 01:00:37.046
Woody.

01:00:42.845 --> 01:00:44.503
Come back, Terri.

01:00:46.053 --> 01:00:48.969
- He's gone.
- No.

01:00:50.887 --> 01:00:53.008
No.

01:00:53.137 --> 01:00:55.175
- Terri.
- No.

01:00:56.846 --> 01:00:59.169
We need you.

01:00:59.305 --> 01:01:01.130
Woody.

01:01:02.847 --> 01:01:04.802
No.

01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:11.133
No. No.

01:01:12.306 --> 01:01:14.344
No.

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:17.595
No.

01:01:20.557 --> 01:01:22.512
Please, Terri.

01:01:23.723 --> 01:01:25.679
Come back.

01:02:00.102 --> 01:02:03.433
Ray. We've got some new data
just coming in.

01:02:04.769 --> 01:02:07.305
We just--
It doesn't make any sense.

01:02:07.437 --> 01:02:09.557
We're not sure how to read this.

01:02:09.686 --> 01:02:12.057
- Data?
- Yes.

01:02:12.187 --> 01:02:16.263
Telemetry reports the REMO left its
orbit and reached the Martian surface.

01:02:16.395 --> 01:02:21.184
- Crashed?
- No, sir. Under power.

01:02:21.313 --> 01:02:24.346
- What?
- Sixty-three minutes
after Mars Recovery went off-line.

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.636
Sir, the graph shows
a controlled descent...

01:02:26.771 --> 01:02:28.928
but that doesn't make any sense.

01:02:32.856 --> 01:02:35.143
They used the REMO as a lander.

01:02:35.273 --> 01:02:38.057
It's-- It's Jim McConnell.
It's got to be.

01:02:38.189 --> 01:02:40.939
Nobody else could have pulled this off.
Nobody else.

01:02:43.732 --> 01:02:44.975
Son of a bitch.

01:04:27.575 --> 01:04:31.901
I've got access to the ERV.
I'm gonna go inside.

01:04:41.827 --> 01:04:44.113
Terri,
is the oxygen generator okay?

01:04:45.286 --> 01:04:49.114
Yeah. It's gonna take a while to get
back to 1 00 percent capacity, though.

01:04:51.370 --> 01:04:53.407
Okay, I'm entering the hab.

01:05:15.122 --> 01:05:17.657
There's still oxygen in here.

01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:19.863
This is a little spooky.

01:05:21.664 --> 01:05:24.414
I don't like the dark at all.

01:05:25.748 --> 01:05:28.071
Need some lights.
Need some lights.

01:05:30.165 --> 01:05:32.535
Okay. Where are we?

01:05:34.082 --> 01:05:36.120
Here we go.

01:05:38.083 --> 01:05:40.653
ERV appears to be
structurally intact.

01:05:47.667 --> 01:05:50.286
Yeah, but just as we thought,
the computers are fried.

01:05:50.417 --> 01:05:52.454
Copy that.

01:05:52.585 --> 01:05:56.448
I got busted filters here.
Clogged intakes.

01:05:56.585 --> 01:06:00.116
Hell of a cleanup job,
but so far no major damage.

01:07:00.049 --> 01:07:02.087
I'm in the greenhouse.

01:07:05.258 --> 01:07:08.789
- You gotta see this.
- What is it,Jim?

01:07:11.175 --> 01:07:13.213
It's working.

01:07:28.385 --> 01:07:30.874
I'll be damned.

01:08:25.890 --> 01:08:28.296
- Luke.
- No!

01:08:37.684 --> 01:08:40.599
You're not here!
You are not here!

01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:47.136
Your wife is Debra.
Your son is Bobby.

01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:49.638
- No!
- You're reading
Treasure Island with him.

01:08:52.435 --> 01:08:54.142
Luke--

01:08:55.310 --> 01:08:57.515
It's all right.
It's me.

01:08:58.895 --> 01:09:01.015
-Jim?
- Yeah.

01:09:02.685 --> 01:09:04.926
No, wait! No!
No, no! Wait, wait!

01:09:05.062 --> 01:09:07.100
He's all right.
He's all right.

01:09:10.063 --> 01:09:12.136
Phil? Phil.

01:09:17.479 --> 01:09:19.554
Terri.

01:09:24.354 --> 01:09:26.559
Jim--Jim, what are you--
what are you--

01:09:26.689 --> 01:09:28.929
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be--

01:09:29.064 --> 01:09:31.102
You're not supposed to be here.
How are you here?

01:09:31.231 --> 01:09:33.518
- How are you here?
- This is a rescue mission.

01:09:35.981 --> 01:09:38.019
Woody wanted me right seat.

01:09:43.358 --> 01:09:44.981
I can't--

01:09:46.232 --> 01:09:48.189
I can't believe--

01:09:58.526 --> 01:10:00.730
Well, where is he?
Where's Woody?

01:10:12.693 --> 01:10:14.649
He didn't make it.

01:10:29.445 --> 01:10:30.855
God.

01:10:32.029 --> 01:10:34.732
Oh. Oh.

01:10:34.863 --> 01:10:36.900
Oh, no, no.

01:10:37.029 --> 01:10:39.945
Oh, God. Oh, no.

01:10:50.947 --> 01:10:53.614
Well, it works, you know?
I give them...

01:10:53.739 --> 01:10:55.860
CO2 and light, and...

01:10:55.989 --> 01:10:57.946
they give me oxygen and food.

01:10:58.074 --> 01:11:00.479
It's-- It's actually not
a bad arrangement, you know?

01:11:00.615 --> 01:11:02.771
It's kind of like
a marriage, really...

01:11:02.907 --> 01:11:05.775
except not as many--
not as many fights.

01:11:05.907 --> 01:11:09.024
- I mean, some fights.
- Luke. Tell us what happened here.

01:11:13.158 --> 01:11:15.114
I--

01:11:17.283 --> 01:11:19.238
We fired the radar...

01:11:20.242 --> 01:11:24.106
and it-- it came,
and they all died.

01:11:24.242 --> 01:11:26.945
They all--
They all died.

01:11:27.076 --> 01:11:29.197
Wh-What do you mean?
What-- What came?

01:11:29.326 --> 01:11:32.360
The force came out of the top
of the mountain and-and-and...

01:11:32.493 --> 01:11:35.823
everybody died,
but I was spared.

01:11:37.618 --> 01:11:40.321
Why? Why?

01:11:41.328 --> 01:11:43.283
Had to be for a reason.

01:11:45.661 --> 01:11:48.778
And then all of a sudden,
I knew the reason why.

01:11:50.578 --> 01:11:53.032
It's so someone would be left
to figure out the secret.

01:11:55.246 --> 01:11:57.201
You know? It's--

01:11:59.830 --> 01:12:04.239
J-J-Just come.Just come,
come, come, come, come, come.

01:12:06.747 --> 01:12:10.693
Is it just me, or is he a few
meal packs short of a picnic?

01:12:10.831 --> 01:12:13.912
Long-term exposure to low gravity can
have an adverse impact on the brain.

01:12:15.081 --> 01:12:17.914
Or then, he could be suffering
from some form of asphyxia.

01:12:20.123 --> 01:12:23.702
Or maybe his whole crew died, and he's
been marooned alone on Mars for a year.

01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:29.079
It's a miracle
he's survived this long.

01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:36.537
I'd better bring him up to speed.

01:12:46.084 --> 01:12:48.454
Great, great.
Great, great, great, great.

01:12:52.043 --> 01:12:54.081
So let me be sure
I understand this.

01:12:55.251 --> 01:12:58.001
Your ship blew up
with all its supplies.

01:12:58.127 --> 01:13:01.079
Then you-- Then you emptied
all the cargo out of the REMO...

01:13:01.211 --> 01:13:03.616
and it was totalled on landing.

01:13:03.752 --> 01:13:07.877
You got no food, no water,
no, no spare oxygen.

01:13:09.753 --> 01:13:11.957
Nothing other than
what I'm looking at right here.

01:13:16.629 --> 01:13:19.331
What kind-- What kind
of rescue mission is this,Jim?

01:13:24.213 --> 01:13:26.085
That kind.

01:13:26.213 --> 01:13:29.165
Check it out.
New nav boards for the ERV.

01:13:29.297 --> 01:13:31.832
I got four round-trip tickets, baby,
right in here.

01:13:35.548 --> 01:13:39.044
Thank you, God!
Oh, thank God.

01:13:45.048 --> 01:13:48.414
When I came to and dug myself out
of the sand, my faceplate was cracked.

01:13:48.548 --> 01:13:52.330
It was leaking.
Leaking badly.

01:13:52.466 --> 01:13:54.504
I barely made it back to base.

01:13:55.716 --> 01:13:59.082
It was weeks before I could
work up the nerve to go back
out there and look for--

01:14:03.133 --> 01:14:05.171
and look for their bodies.

01:14:08.134 --> 01:14:12.957
Reneé was the only one I could find,
but it just didn't seem right somehow
to just dig one grave.

01:14:14.218 --> 01:14:16.256
Oh, God.

01:14:36.761 --> 01:14:39.049
Has it been blowing like this
for a while?

01:14:39.179 --> 01:14:40.553
Yeah.

01:14:41.804 --> 01:14:47.174
We saw a big storm on our screens,
but Micker said it was turning south.

01:14:47.305 --> 01:14:49.260
If it holds course.

01:14:52.805 --> 01:14:56.218
Luke, this--
this whatever it was.

01:14:56.347 --> 01:14:59.132
This-- This force.

01:15:01.014 --> 01:15:04.096
You said it came directly
out of the top of the mountain?

01:15:05.890 --> 01:15:07.927
Don't you believe me?

01:15:10.807 --> 01:15:13.343
That's okay,Jim. You don't believe me,
that's okay, but I'm not crazy.

01:15:13.474 --> 01:15:16.675
- I know that much. I'm not crazy.
- What'd you mean by its ""secret""?

01:15:18.766 --> 01:15:19.963
What secret?

01:15:20.142 --> 01:15:22.595
Listen, hundred of millions
of years have gone by, okay?

01:15:22.725 --> 01:15:26.470
You got erosion, lava flow,
sandstorms, meteor impacts.

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:28.757
Hell, in that much time,
the whole surface of the planet
would have changed.

01:15:28.892 --> 01:15:30.848
So it's no wonder
we never saw it before.

01:15:30.976 --> 01:15:33.132
I mean, we saw it,
but not like they meant us to.

01:15:33.268 --> 01:15:36.384
- There was too much dirt on it.
- Saw what, Luke?

01:15:38.435 --> 01:15:40.307
Saw this.

01:15:51.352 --> 01:15:52.596
Jesus.

01:15:54.311 --> 01:15:57.096
Oh, my God. Luke, what are you
trying to tell us?

01:15:57.228 --> 01:15:59.978
- You're trying to tell us
that that's a face?
- That's the face.

01:16:02.021 --> 01:16:04.095
It's the face. It's real.

01:16:04.229 --> 01:16:06.266
Somebody put that thing there,
and it's not us.

01:16:07.438 --> 01:16:08.978
Jim--

01:16:12.188 --> 01:16:14.226
It's not possible.

01:16:16.814 --> 01:16:19.267
Jesus.

01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:23.019
Look at that. My God.

01:16:25.731 --> 01:16:27.272
I know.

01:16:30.107 --> 01:16:32.891
Luke, uh, what--

01:16:33.024 --> 01:16:34.979
what about that sound you heard
before the explosion?

01:16:35.107 --> 01:16:37.596
Oh, yeah. Good,Jim.
Th-Th-That's the key. That's the key.

01:16:48.192 --> 01:16:51.523
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

01:16:59.109 --> 01:17:01.231
- It's pauses. Do you hear the pauses?
- Yeah.

01:17:05.777 --> 01:17:07.815
See, that's what made me
realize it's a pattern.

01:17:09.402 --> 01:17:11.358
It's a repeating pattern.

01:17:13.486 --> 01:17:16.354
- Mathematical?
- Mm-hmm. That occurred to me too.

01:17:25.404 --> 01:17:27.394
There are distinct blocks
within each pattern...

01:17:27.529 --> 01:17:30.231
and within each block,
the tones come in groups of three.

01:17:30.363 --> 01:17:34.226
It's three, three, three, three, three,
three. It's always three, three, three.
It's always the same.

01:17:34.364 --> 01:17:36.319
And, see, for months
I struggled to analyse it, you know...

01:17:36.447 --> 01:17:38.686
trying different constructs,
and then I thought about dimensions.

01:17:38.822 --> 01:17:42.069
- X-Y-Z coordinates.
- Exactly. Three groups
equals three dimensions.

01:17:42.197 --> 01:17:47.151
So I-I assigned different graphic values
to each block group and tone...

01:17:47.281 --> 01:17:49.948
and I came up with this.

01:17:58.782 --> 01:18:00.939
- Hello.
- Oh, my God.

01:18:02.032 --> 01:18:05.481
- Is that what I think it is?
- DNA?

01:18:05.616 --> 01:18:07.654
- You see it?
- Yeah.

01:18:09.784 --> 01:18:13.729
- It's a model of DNA.
- So-- So somebody left that thing here.

01:18:13.867 --> 01:18:15.942
Okay. Somebody other than human.

01:18:18.659 --> 01:18:21.990
But, uh, what is it?

01:18:22.118 --> 01:18:24.073
It's a signature.

01:18:26.410 --> 01:18:29.160
It's a self-portrait
of whatever species created the face.

01:18:31.619 --> 01:18:36.028
Yeah, but, uh,
that DNA looks human.

01:18:36.161 --> 01:18:39.243
- No.
- No, it's not. It's missing
the last pair of chromosomes. See?

01:18:39.370 --> 01:18:43.115
- This is close. It's damn close.
- ""Close""?

01:18:43.245 --> 01:18:46.362
The difference
between man and ape is less than
three percent genetic material.

01:18:47.538 --> 01:18:52.823
But that three percent
gives you Einstein, Mozart.

01:18:52.955 --> 01:18:54.364
Jack the Ripper.

01:18:55.663 --> 01:18:58.068
Yeah, he's right.

01:19:16.665 --> 01:19:19.829
Four pallets, oral,
topical medications...

01:19:19.957 --> 01:19:23.039
splints, bandages,
one complete med pack.

01:19:23.166 --> 01:19:25.868
With eight tubes
of antifungal cream.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.037
Well, at least
we won't rash to death.

01:19:31.708 --> 01:19:34.623
Luke. How do you feel?

01:19:36.042 --> 01:19:38.994
Lighter. A lot lighter.

01:19:39.126 --> 01:19:41.163
- Welcome back.
- Thanks, man.

01:19:43.334 --> 01:19:46.914
The backup generator is salvageable.
So are two of the solar panels.

01:19:47.043 --> 01:19:49.283
I'm pretty sure I can get
the oxygen still back into production.

01:19:49.419 --> 01:19:53.911
So we're not in such bad shape,
considering.

01:19:54.044 --> 01:19:55.999
That's good, Terri.

01:19:58.169 --> 01:19:59.627
Good work.

01:20:01.086 --> 01:20:02.627
Jesus.

01:20:05.545 --> 01:20:09.870
Look at this.
Phil's idea of absolute essentials.

01:20:10.004 --> 01:20:11.662
Of course.

01:20:30.214 --> 01:20:32.289
Hey, hey, hey. Hey!

01:20:34.173 --> 01:20:35.167
My baby.

01:20:36.798 --> 01:20:39.832
- It's not a signature.
- What?

01:20:41.423 --> 01:20:43.628
The noise from the face.
It's not a signature.

01:20:45.758 --> 01:20:47.334
It's a test.

01:20:47.466 --> 01:20:50.251
It's asking us
for the right answer.

01:20:50.383 --> 01:20:53.915
It wants us to put in
the missing pair of chromosomes.

01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:56.005
Why?

01:20:56.133 --> 01:20:58.171
To prove that we're human.

01:21:00.884 --> 01:21:04.131
We fired radar into that thing,
concentrated radio waves,
and you're saying--

01:21:04.259 --> 01:21:06.415
Which it interpreted
as the wrong answer.

01:21:06.551 --> 01:21:08.507
It's-- It could be like
a security alarm.

01:21:08.635 --> 01:21:12.794
When it gets an incorrect response,
it defends itself.

01:21:12.927 --> 01:21:15.333
So what happens when it gets
the right answer?

01:21:17.053 --> 01:21:20.501
Well, I don't know that, Phil.

01:21:23.302 --> 01:21:25.341
But we gotta find out.

01:21:39.388 --> 01:21:42.552
Luke, what if we
work this the other way?

01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:46.259
We figure out which tones would be
equivalent to the missing chromosomes...

01:21:46.388 --> 01:21:49.173
and then dub them into
your recording of the signal.

01:21:49.305 --> 01:21:52.304
- Is that possible?
- Yeah.

01:21:55.390 --> 01:21:58.008
- Yeah, I think so.
- Good, good, good.

01:21:58.139 --> 01:22:03.924
What about the radar gun? Will it
accept the input so we can transmit
a completed signal back to the face?

01:22:04.057 --> 01:22:08.003
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, jim. What if you're wrong?

01:22:09.765 --> 01:22:11.804
Whoever goes out there--

01:22:13.016 --> 01:22:15.967
I mean,
what if you're wrong? Three people
have already died over that thing.

01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:17.640
Four.

01:22:21.183 --> 01:22:22.724
Terri.

01:22:25.351 --> 01:22:29.973
If we leave here without getting
some answers, they all died in vain.

01:22:31.810 --> 01:22:33.351
We don't--

01:22:34.643 --> 01:22:36.765
We don't have to go out there.

01:22:54.896 --> 01:22:58.392
Got a lot of static here.
Something's interfering.

01:22:58.521 --> 01:23:01.804
Yeah. The antenna got knocked around
pretty badly in the blast.

01:23:01.938 --> 01:23:04.723
This is the best resolution
I think we're gonna be able to get.

01:23:04.855 --> 01:23:08.635
All right, guys. I got the nav boards.
I'm sealing the airlock.

01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:17.230
- Check the video feed.
- Video feed looks good.

01:23:20.648 --> 01:23:23.481
- How close do we have to get?
- I'm not sure.

01:23:24.649 --> 01:23:26.686
Maybe I'll stop it
right over there by that rock.

01:23:30.107 --> 01:23:31.730
Do it. Good.

01:24:05.945 --> 01:24:09.108
Okay. Here we go.

01:24:55.074 --> 01:24:56.318
Look at that,Jim.

01:24:57.533 --> 01:25:01.148
It worked.
Oh, God, it worked.

01:25:01.283 --> 01:25:05.324
Guys, I don't know
what the hell we just did...

01:25:05.450 --> 01:25:08.863
but does that look to you
like a hostile gesture?

01:25:08.993 --> 01:25:13.200
No. More like an invitation.

01:25:14.576 --> 01:25:16.366
Or another test.

01:25:18.618 --> 01:25:20.693
- Check for radiation.
- Normal.

01:25:21.868 --> 01:25:24.985
Seismic: Normal.
Anemometer: Steady.

01:25:27.077 --> 01:25:28.487
Luke...

01:25:30.578 --> 01:25:32.533
does the rover still work?

01:25:43.704 --> 01:25:45.742
Phil, do you read?

01:25:45.871 --> 01:25:49.782
Uh, yeah,Jim, your signal's breaking up
a little in the storm, but I read you.

01:25:49.913 --> 01:25:51.950
We're at the face.

01:25:53.163 --> 01:25:55.569
We're gonna need a few minutes here.
Same deadline.

01:25:57.997 --> 01:26:00.830
Launch at 1 950 with
or without us. Copy?

01:26:02.998 --> 01:26:04.704
Copy that.

01:26:05.707 --> 01:26:09.452
Jim.
You sure you wanna do this?

01:26:10.707 --> 01:26:12.662
I'm not sure
about anything any more.

01:26:15.124 --> 01:26:19.332
But I didn't come 1 00 million miles
just to turn back in the last ten feet.

01:26:27.126 --> 01:26:28.534
Yeah.

01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:41.739
Please work.

01:26:43.293 --> 01:26:44.834
It's gonna work.

01:26:49.169 --> 01:26:52.286
Yes. Yes.
Computers are on-line.

01:26:53.545 --> 01:26:57.290
I am gonna start loading software.

01:27:08.254 --> 01:27:10.376
The surface...

01:27:10.505 --> 01:27:12.460
seems firm and level.

01:27:13.630 --> 01:27:15.585
Roger that.

01:27:15.713 --> 01:27:17.669
The texture's smooth.

01:27:18.839 --> 01:27:21.587
I've got good footing.
No obstructions.

01:27:22.881 --> 01:27:25.001
- Let's check our PSI.
- Okay.

01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:29.293
Guys, I gotta tell you...

01:27:29.423 --> 01:27:32.421
we're losing visibility here
really fast. Over.

01:27:32.548 --> 01:27:34.918
It's solid. We're trapped.

01:27:36.090 --> 01:27:39.787
Don't move.
Just keep this orientation.

01:27:43.007 --> 01:27:44.548
Guys?

01:27:46.925 --> 01:27:48.880
Luke? Terri? Jim?

01:27:50.051 --> 01:27:52.088
Phil, can you still hear me?

01:27:53.008 --> 01:27:56.126
Is anyone there? Over.

01:28:04.593 --> 01:28:06.549
God. That's it.

01:28:07.885 --> 01:28:10.588
There's no handles. We're not getting
out of here unless they let us out.

01:28:41.639 --> 01:28:43.843
-Jim.Jim, what are you doing?
-Jim, what are you doing?

01:28:43.972 --> 01:28:45.300
-Jim.Jim, your suit!
- Stop. Stop it!
Jim, you're depressurizing.

01:28:45.431 --> 01:28:47.386
- Seal your suit.
- Come on!
- Seal your suit now!

01:28:55.890 --> 01:28:57.845
There's pressure in here.

01:28:57.974 --> 01:29:02.347
Above Mars atmospheric?
It's impossible.

01:29:04.891 --> 01:29:07.890
We're millions of miles from Earth
inside a giant white face.

01:29:08.017 --> 01:29:09.972
What's impossible?

01:29:11.559 --> 01:29:13.135
There's 1 2 PSI in here.

01:29:14.601 --> 01:29:17.468
Nitrogen and oxygen.

01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:19.557
Otherwise known as air.

01:29:32.811 --> 01:29:35.808
Hey, wait,Jim. I haven't checked
for lethal trace gases, and I haven't--

01:29:39.895 --> 01:29:41.269
What the hell.

01:31:29.864 --> 01:31:31.238
Look.

01:31:39.615 --> 01:31:43.277
- That what I think it is?
- Yeah. It's Mars.

01:33:18.584 --> 01:33:20.539
That's where they went.

01:33:25.251 --> 01:33:28.830
Look. One stayed behind.

01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:55.991
Earth,
before the continents separated.

01:34:07.921 --> 01:34:10.706
My God. That's it.

01:34:10.838 --> 01:34:12.794
Hundreds of millions of years ago...

01:34:12.922 --> 01:34:15.707
there was a sudden explosion
of life on Earth.

01:34:17.089 --> 01:34:21.083
The first multi-celled plants
and animals appeared.

01:34:21.214 --> 01:34:24.213
No one has ever understood
why or how it happened.

01:35:30.222 --> 01:35:32.177
They seeded Earth.

01:35:38.139 --> 01:35:40.094
They're us.

01:35:42.223 --> 01:35:43.337
We're them.

01:36:10.684 --> 01:36:13.173
Luke? Terri? Jim? Anyone?

01:36:13.309 --> 01:36:15.347
ERV to rover.
Rover, this is ERV.

01:36:15.476 --> 01:36:18.012
Does anyone copy?
Does anyone copy?

01:36:27.686 --> 01:36:31.134
ERVto rover.
Rover, this is ERV. Do you copy?

01:36:31.270 --> 01:36:33.343
- Phil?
- Oh, thank God, I got you.

01:36:33.478 --> 01:36:36.725
- Phil, we read you.
- Listen, the storm
is getting bad, really bad.

01:36:36.853 --> 01:36:39.805
It's gonna totally sock us in
in a few minutes. You've got
to get back to the ship.

01:36:39.937 --> 01:36:42.472
- Phil?
- I repeat, you've got to
get back to the ship.

01:36:42.604 --> 01:36:44.013
Phil?

01:36:45.855 --> 01:36:47.478
We're in a ship.

01:36:50.563 --> 01:36:53.561
This is a ship.

01:36:54.772 --> 01:36:58.387
And the countdown's
already started.

01:36:59.856 --> 01:37:02.095
- He's right.
- Yeah.

01:37:02.230 --> 01:37:04.305
Yeah, let's-- let's get
the hell out of here.

01:37:07.607 --> 01:37:09.313
Jim?

01:37:10.606 --> 01:37:11.601
Jim.

01:37:14.690 --> 01:37:17.642
Come on. We gotta go.

01:37:17.774 --> 01:37:20.975
- I'm not coming with you.
- What?

01:37:23.025 --> 01:37:24.980
What are you talking about?

01:37:26.608 --> 01:37:27.805
We've gotta get home.

01:37:29.442 --> 01:37:31.397
That's where I'm going.

01:37:33.609 --> 01:37:35.232
Don't you see?

01:37:36.901 --> 01:37:39.934
That's-- That's what
all this is for.

01:37:42.610 --> 01:37:46.390
Terri, you were right.
This is an invitation.

01:37:47.777 --> 01:37:50.265
This is an invitation for us
to follow them home.

01:37:53.152 --> 01:37:54.610
I'm going.

01:37:58.403 --> 01:38:00.440
It's what I was born for.

01:38:03.029 --> 01:38:04.984
Like Maggie said:

01:38:06.445 --> 01:38:10.142
""To stand on a new world and--
and look beyond it...

01:38:11.571 --> 01:38:12.768
to the next one.''

01:38:16.988 --> 01:38:18.944
I know this is right.

01:38:21.405 --> 01:38:22.519
For me.

01:38:24.781 --> 01:38:28.478
And you're running out of time.
You gotta get back to the ERV
and you gotta get off this planet.

01:38:39.824 --> 01:38:41.861
Thank you
for saving my life, buddy.

01:38:43.282 --> 01:38:44.905
It was a privilege.

01:39:03.785 --> 01:39:05.906
I wish Woody
were here to see you.

01:39:08.994 --> 01:39:10.949
He is here, Terri.

01:39:12.161 --> 01:39:14.235
We wouldn't have made it
without him.

01:39:29.204 --> 01:39:31.241
He would have wanted you
to have this.

01:40:16.125 --> 01:40:19.538
ERV to rover.
Rover, this is ERV. Do you copy?

01:40:26.918 --> 01:40:30.201
ERV to rover.
Rover, this is ERV. Do you read me?

01:40:35.294 --> 01:40:37.913
Phil, this is Luke.
Do you copy?

01:40:46.504 --> 01:40:49.620
- He's not reading me.
- I can barely read you.

01:40:49.754 --> 01:40:52.538
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- Yeah.

01:41:48.551 --> 01:41:52.592
I've lost the base camp beacon.
We're driving blind.

01:41:52.718 --> 01:41:55.965
I'm just gonna keep going on a straight
line, okay? That's our only chance.

01:42:08.095 --> 01:42:11.792
- 1 949. Terri, we're not gonna make it.
- No.

01:42:11.929 --> 01:42:16.503
I've worked with Phil for four years,
and I know Jim gave him a direct order,
but he is not gonna leave without us.

01:42:17.304 --> 01:42:20.007
Please. Luke?

01:42:20.138 --> 01:42:22.259
Terri? Jim?

01:42:23.888 --> 01:42:25.050
ERV to rover.

01:42:26.389 --> 01:42:28.628
Rover, this is ERV.
Do you read me?

01:42:28.763 --> 01:42:32.924
Phil, do you read?
This is Luke. We're coming in. Phil.

01:42:35.264 --> 01:42:38.132
- Phil!
- Phil isn't here right now.

01:42:38.265 --> 01:42:40.967
He, uh, left for Earth
five minutes ago!

01:42:41.099 --> 01:42:43.219
Please leave a message
after the beep!

01:43:33.187 --> 01:43:34.845
Where is Jim?

01:43:38.729 --> 01:43:40.186
He caught another ride.

01:45:39.741 --> 01:45:43.024
- Dear God, look at that.
- Is that him?

01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:46.237
Have a great ride,Jim.
