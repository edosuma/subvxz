PLANET: CHITÓN
POLITICAL REGULATION: DICTATORATORY

00:57.208 --> 01:03.250
LEADER: ADMIRAL SCORE
POPULATION: 250,000

01:05.458 --> 01:08.542
POPULATION: 250,001

01:22.708 --> 01:24.458
Eureka! It works!

01:25.833 --> 01:27.125
It works!

01:27.833 --> 01:29.708
He is handsome!

01:31.042 --> 01:32.583
He looks like a normal baby.

01:39.042 --> 01:40.375
Impossible is them.

01:41.292 --> 01:43.625
It is impossible for them to know that quickly.

01:45.917 --> 01:48.792
- We have to hide it, Jan!
- They will surely find it.

01:49.250 --> 01:52.500
- Then?
- Only one thing we can do.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.125
They arrived.

02:14.208 --> 02:15.042
Nice.

02:15.125 --> 02:17.667
You will free us
from them someday.

02:24.542 --> 02:27.542
You will be safe here.
That's the most sophisticated zone on the planet.

02:44.542 --> 02:47.042
When you grow up, you will come back
to save us.

02:54.708 --> 02:57.958
- Get out of my lab, Traitor!
- Go to where you came from!

03:09.292 --> 03:12.042
First of all, good morning.

03:17.625 --> 03:19.750
I know everything. Don't waste my time.

03:20.042 --> 03:21.042
He is my son!

03:21.125 --> 03:23.833
No, he is an experiment.

03:24.417 --> 03:26.875
- Where did you save him?
- In a place you can't find.

03:26.958 --> 03:29.042
Don't force me to press the button ...

03:29.417 --> 03:31.417
and finish this all.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
I can help.

03:33.750 --> 03:36.167
Daddy doesn't have time for your boast,
Ata score.

03:36.250 --> 03:39.292
However, my father, my cousin, Sigfred,
my age

03:39.375 --> 03:40.625
but allowed to torture.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Remember when dad asked you

03:43.083 --> 03:46.167
to find all pets
on this planet to be destroyed ...

03:46.500 --> 03:48.375
but instead you hide partially?

03:48.458 --> 03:50.917
I feel sorry for them.
However, I have now grown up.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.917
Somehow you can be my daughter.

03:53.208 --> 03:55.500
You always make daddy look stupid!

04:00.542 --> 04:03.083
That's a blue planet.

04:03.667 --> 04:05.708
Earth. Earth.

04:07.792 --> 04:10.583
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I know where he is.

04:10.833 --> 04:13.167
You can't do anything.
That child will defeat you!

04:13.250 --> 04:16.416
OK. Do you want daddy to be proud of you?

04:17.083 --> 04:19.166
If you want to sit in this chair
one day...

04:20.583 --> 04:22.208
this is your chance.

04:27.625 --> 04:30.417
Listen to daddy, say.
That child is a finishing weapon.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.125
Catch him alive.

04:32.667 --> 04:35.250
When you caught him,
dad will come to you.

04:35.333 --> 04:38.125
OK, Daddy. Not for long.
I will not disappoint Father.

06:15.292 --> 06:20.667
AMERICAN / SPAIN

06:20.750 --> 06:23.917
BUM / NO!

06:35.625 --> 06:37.125
GARAGE LÓPEZ

06:42.542 --> 06:46.583
This is it,
the wink of a freak's lamp from a distance.

06:46.792 --> 06:48.542
Don't start, Juan. Let him pass.

06:48.625 --> 06:51.875
Do not want.
The impatient person can't pass me.

06:52.042 --> 06:54.333
And you will damage your car!

06:54.667 --> 06:56.625
You stupid!

07:10.083 --> 07:12.542
- Are you thinking the same thing?
- yes.

07:12.875 --> 07:14.000
What do you think?

07:14.542 --> 07:17.875
- I have no idea. You?
- That's not a car.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.083
God!

07:32.375 --> 07:35.458
I'll unload the object
and collect the parts!

07:36.042 --> 07:37.500
That's meteorite, Juan.

07:37.875 --> 07:41.750
Or an asteroid. I don't know the difference.

07:41.833 --> 07:44.083
Sorry I got nervous.

07:51.292 --> 07:53.042
Juan, I heard something.

07:53.125 --> 07:54.917
- Come here.
- You can hear something.

07:55.292 --> 07:58.542
- Maria, don't come near.
- There are people inside. Shut up

08:00.917 --> 08:03.417
Look, Juan! See!

08:03.708 --> 08:05.625
This is a gift from heaven.

08:05.875 --> 08:07.792
Seriously!

08:08.167 --> 08:09.625
Look at the baby!

08:10.083 --> 08:11.208
We will take care of him.

08:11.708 --> 08:13.667
Not. He is not ours!

08:13.792 --> 08:16.417
However, look at him. He is very funny.

08:23.292 --> 08:26.375
Honey, it's not a baby, it's a dwarf.

08:27.625 --> 08:31.500
- We can't leave it here.
- The whiskers are weird.

08:31.708 --> 08:34.957
- What do we know about babies?
- I know they don't fall from the sky.

08:35.042 --> 08:36.417
If it's a miracle, it could be.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.082
I have been praying for months
to be given a child.

08:39.625 --> 08:42.832
Maria, you are crazy.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.750
Hi, Daddy!

08:45.958 --> 08:47.833
Hi, Daddy!

08:48.208 --> 08:50.583
Look, daddy.

08:51.042 --> 08:52.750
Look, sweet boy.

08:53.083 --> 08:54.833
He knows who his father is.

08:57.167 --> 08:58.458
Little child!

09:37.458 --> 09:39.542
Apart from the mustache,

09:39.792 --> 09:41.292
he looks normal to me.

09:50.292 --> 09:51.667
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

09:51.750 --> 09:52.917
My car is not powered.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.083
Don't worry, friend.
We will make it like new.

09:55.250 --> 09:56.917
We have the latest technology.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
I prefer the conventional method.
thanks.

10:30.542 --> 10:32.458
Lopez, push harder!

10:33.125 --> 10:36.583
Weak foundation! Come on! Stronger!

10:36.667 --> 10:38.875
Fast, damn it!

10:54.125 --> 10:56.000
- Come here!
- Here!

10:56.292 --> 10:58.083
- Oper on me!
- Quickly kick!

10:58.167 --> 11:00.542
- You loser, kick it!
- stupid goalkeeper!

11:00.833 --> 11:03.458
Fast, Mustache!

11:03.542 --> 11:04.875
Oper, kid!

11:04.958 --> 11:06.125
Loser!

11:08.208 --> 11:09.625
Stupid!

11:09.792 --> 11:11.708
Quickly shift!

11:26.833 --> 11:29.208
Goal! Come on!

11:30.333 --> 11:31.333
Tos!

11:32.083 --> 11:33.167
Goal!

11:33.792 --> 11:34.792
Impossible.

11:34.875 --> 11:36.417
I scored. What is wrong?

11:37.500 --> 11:38.542
Come on!

11:39.667 --> 11:40.667
What is wrong?

11:42.583 --> 11:43.667
Stupid player.

11:45.208 --> 11:47.792
Daddy said, don't do it
in front of other people.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.000
However, I want to win!

11:49.083 --> 11:51.167
In fact no one wants to play with you.

11:51.500 --> 11:52.833
That includes cheating.

11:53.125 --> 11:54.750
Cowards who don't want to play clean.

11:54.833 --> 11:58.125
- That's how I play. That is me.
- Then hide it, son.

11:58.208 --> 12:00.708
Keep doing it, and they
will think you're a weirdo.

12:00.792 --> 12:02.542
Not being a champion,
instead you will be alone.

12:33.833 --> 12:35.750
Maybe you told them wrong
the time.

12:36.542 --> 12:39.208
- Are you sure you said?
- Of course.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.292
The address? Do you include the address?

12:41.375 --> 12:44.042
- Is there an invitation?
- They don't want to come, Father.

12:44.500 --> 12:46.458
Is it because I did something strange?

12:46.625 --> 12:49.500
Not strange, honey, but special.

12:49.833 --> 12:53.875
- Then why is that bad?
- Because you're in Spain.

12:53.958 --> 12:59.083
Listen, kid, somewhere else, Germany,
France, Norway, you will be appreciated.

12:59.792 --> 13:02.542
Unfortunately here,
they even tackle you.

13:02.625 --> 13:06.333
- If you stand out, they don't like it.
- Is that why my friends didn't come?

13:06.417 --> 13:09.833
- Because I'm not like them?
- They won't be like you.

13:10.083 --> 13:13.125
However, if you don't do your "habits,"
you can be like them.

13:13.500 --> 13:16.417
My child, you don't need to do anything
special ...

13:16.500 --> 13:18.625
at all to succeed.

13:18.708 --> 13:22.625
Listen, in this country,
You have to be an ordinary person to be happy.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.625
Come on, kid, make a request.

13:25.875 --> 13:27.125
I want to be normal.

13:31.625 --> 13:34.083
My child, next year
I'll make a mini cake.

13:37.083 --> 13:40.875
20 YEARS LATER

13:42.542 --> 13:45.875
<i> ... the best electrical equipment </ i>
<i> at the best price. </ i></i></i>

13:46.250 --> 13:47.292
<i> Take steps. </ i></i>

13:47.958 --> 13:50.750
<i> Of course with a warranty </ i>
<i> from CHIT Technology ... </ i></i></i>

13:56.208 --> 13:57.208
Yes?

13:58.500 --> 14:00.667
- Where are you?
- here.

14:00.750 --> 14:03.083
- Where? Are you falling asleep again?
<i> - No. </ i></i>

14:03.167 --> 14:06.042
At the office, sending goods.

14:06.250 --> 14:10.042
- I was passing, but didn't see you.
- Maybe I'm on the toilet.

14:10.125 --> 14:11.500
<i> - When? </ i>
- Just now.</i>

14:11.583 --> 14:14.875
Yes, just now ... I was in the toilet.

14:15.917 --> 14:20.083
- I went there to say something.
- No, I'm busy with reports.

14:20.333 --> 14:23.292
- Was it not shipping?
- Items that do not match the report.

14:26.833 --> 14:27.667
God damn it.

14:53.542 --> 14:55.708
- You see López?
- Not.

14:55.792 --> 14:56.792
Neither do I.

15:02.833 --> 15:05.833
- You can warn me.
- Watch out for boxes!

15:19.042 --> 15:21.125
- When did you come?
- I do not know.

15:21.208 --> 15:23.250
I arrived early. I'm very busy.

15:23.333 --> 15:26.042
Juan, you know I don't want you to think
as boss.

15:26.250 --> 15:28.042
You and I remain friends.

15:28.333 --> 15:30.625
- Do you smell weird?
- You're the weird one.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.083
This is colony. Expensive.

15:33.167 --> 15:34.667
Since when did you wear colony?

15:34.750 --> 15:38.000
To discuss that, I have to take off the boss's hat
and wear a friend's hat.

15:38.333 --> 15:42.042
- Business and friends cannot mix.
- Technically, you're not my boss.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.458
He started working today.
I hired him.

15:45.542 --> 15:48.083
- Did you give the woman a job?
- Not like that.

15:48.292 --> 15:49.583
He deserves it.

15:50.167 --> 15:54.875
However, something appeared during the interview.
You could say splash.

15:54.958 --> 15:56.708
You can't interview to seduce.

15:57.083 --> 15:59.792
Everyone knows that job interview
almost like a date.

16:00.042 --> 16:01.417
Not.

16:01.500 --> 16:05.292
In dating, what are you talking about?
Job, hobby.

16:05.458 --> 16:07.458
Talk about hobbies ...

16:07.750 --> 16:11.000
You will not believe, but our hobbies are the same.
Reading and traveling.

16:11.083 --> 16:12.417
Everyone likes that too!

16:12.500 --> 16:15.958
Please prepare something interesting,
as a welcome.

16:16.042 --> 16:17.750
We never welcome anyone.

16:17.958 --> 16:19.708
I wear a friend's hat to say ...

16:19.792 --> 16:22.417
if you and I haven't been partying for a long time.

16:22.667 --> 16:25.042
Don't take me I want to wait.

16:26.042 --> 16:27.917
I knew it. You just arrived!

16:31.792 --> 16:32.625
Shit.

16:57.042 --> 16:57.875
Luisa?

17:10.333 --> 17:12.375
Good morning. Can you...

17:12.458 --> 17:14.041
Not. Juan?

17:14.916 --> 17:16.791
- Luisa?
- What are you doing here?

17:17.666 --> 17:21.416
I know that you will be successful from a long time ago,
and you become a receptionist.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.666
No, I don't work here.

17:24.958 --> 17:27.208
I work in a company,
but in big work.

17:28.500 --> 17:31.417
- Well. You teased me.
- I didn't expect to meet like this!

17:31.667 --> 17:35.417
We have to chat. Not now.
Can you call Jaime Gonzalez?

17:35.500 --> 17:37.875
Jaime? Will you work here?

17:38.208 --> 17:41.833
It seems like that. I still can't believe it.
Do you have to interview eight times?

17:46.292 --> 17:47.375
- Jaime.
<i> - Yes? </ i></i>

17:47.458 --> 17:49.125
Luisa Lanas is here.

17:49.417 --> 17:50.542
<i> - Send him in. </ i>
- Well.</i>

17:51.917 --> 17:53.208
You are really great.

17:53.458 --> 17:56.042
You should consider
to be a receptionist.

18:00.458 --> 18:02.375
Usually if there are new people,

18:02.458 --> 18:06.042
we have a welcoming party,
a little drink.

18:06.417 --> 18:08.167
You like?

18:09.417 --> 18:11.833
Okay, everybody, look, we will
automatic selfie.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.875
I know this isn't an ordinary selfie,

18:14.958 --> 18:17.292
but you understand.

18:20.250 --> 18:23.667
Good memories on the first day, right?
This is how we are here.

18:23.750 --> 18:26.708
Nice atmosphere.
Get out and enjoy life all week long.

18:27.125 --> 18:28.250
Where is the toilet?

18:28.333 --> 18:30.083
Go through the door, go right.

18:33.458 --> 18:35.708
- Where did you know him?
- On campus.

18:35.792 --> 18:37.917
- She's my friend's girlfriend.
- Do you like it?

18:38.000 --> 18:40.750
He is not my close friend.

18:41.042 --> 18:43.708
- I ask do you like him?
- Jaime, no, I don't like it.

18:43.792 --> 18:46.958
Sir, if there's nothing else, we say goodbye.

18:47.750 --> 18:50.167
Shut up here until I order.

18:50.250 --> 18:52.708
Our Sif ended two hours ago.

18:52.917 --> 18:54.958
See. See the device?

18:55.583 --> 18:58.167
He has a greater commitment
to the company than you.

19:00.083 --> 19:02.125
I always need my boss's hat with them.

19:02.458 --> 19:05.458
We drink a lot. It is enough.

19:06.417 --> 19:09.542
If you go at once,
he will be suspicious.

19:09.833 --> 19:12.167
I want to order pizza
with lots of olives.

19:12.250 --> 19:13.375
He likes olives.

19:13.458 --> 19:15.625
You ask during the interview
about his favorite pizza?

19:16.125 --> 19:18.750
When he returns, go to the store
to buy ice ...

19:18.833 --> 19:20.000
and don't come back.

19:20.083 --> 19:24.125
- Do you know what that means? Strategy.
- The HR person is teasing me.

19:25.500 --> 19:27.792
I told you he was
during the interview.

19:28.208 --> 19:30.583
I'll find an excuse and leave.

19:30.833 --> 19:33.750
No, wait. Remember Juan at college?

19:34.250 --> 19:35.750
That's it, the mustache.

19:36.125 --> 19:39.458
He works here too.
Just like at a party.

19:43.167 --> 19:44.583
- Juan!
- What?

19:44.792 --> 19:48.042
- Okay, I'll stay.
- stay?

19:50.208 --> 19:52.042
Juanito, please get ice.

19:52.542 --> 19:55.542
We've been partying for so long
so it runs out of ice.

19:55.625 --> 19:57.208
Yes, there is ice.

19:57.583 --> 20:00.042
- No, there's no ice.
- There is.

20:00.500 --> 20:01.333
Where?

20:16.292 --> 20:17.292
Ice.

20:21.417 --> 20:22.417
Where is Luisa?

20:23.208 --> 20:26.625
I don't want to say,
but he seems scared.

20:27.458 --> 20:30.458
Here is too intense for him
so he decided to leave.

20:30.667 --> 20:32.958
Too bad. I've thought about it
about Aunt Clari.

20:33.708 --> 20:36.083
Don't tell me about Aunt Clari.

20:36.167 --> 20:39.375
Juan, they have the right to know too.
Don't be racism.

20:39.833 --> 20:42.958
Tricks to last long in bed,
and I mean not sleep.

20:43.500 --> 20:46.667
I imagine three things.
Aunt Clari is dancing,

20:47.292 --> 20:50.250
scallion cake and cream corduroy pants.

20:50.333 --> 20:51.333
Well? Understand?

20:51.458 --> 20:53.125
I thought about it in turn.

20:53.625 --> 20:55.333
One ... and the other ...

20:56.333 --> 20:57.333
and the other.

20:57.417 --> 20:59.417
That way I can last long
with women.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.333
Not hours. It's really troublesome.

21:24.792 --> 21:25.792
Juan!

21:27.417 --> 21:28.417
What are you doing?

21:29.375 --> 21:31.917
- I want to go home.
- Go straight home or wander?

21:33.458 --> 21:35.417
I do not know. Are you hungry

21:36.583 --> 21:37.583
You?

21:38.875 --> 21:40.000
Pizza?

21:43.750 --> 21:45.250
Next time.

21:45.458 --> 21:47.417
- Hey, maybe I still have time.
- Can you pass?

21:47.500 --> 21:51.375
- Certainly. What do you bet?
- Impossible. See you tomorrow.

22:01.375 --> 22:02.375
Excuse me.

22:03.833 --> 22:05.667
Do you like olives?

22:08.167 --> 22:10.542
- How about Rober?
- Where's Rober?

22:11.250 --> 22:13.875
- Where's Rober?
- from campus?

22:14.417 --> 22:16.667
- yes. Are you still together?
- Juan, that's right.

22:16.750 --> 22:18.542
We graduated ten years ago.

22:18.625 --> 22:20.833
We don't even date.
Impossible I'm with Rober.

22:21.083 --> 22:23.250
I don't know, just asking.

22:23.333 --> 22:26.167
If you know I'm here eating together
with you, he must be angry.

22:26.250 --> 22:27.250
Angry? Why?

22:27.708 --> 22:31.375
Rober always ... I don't know ...
think you are weird.

22:31.667 --> 22:33.208
People talk too much.

22:33.500 --> 22:36.125
He said, "Don't you think of him
hiding something?"

22:36.250 --> 22:39.375
I replied, "Juan looks normal to me."

22:40.167 --> 22:41.708
That's what I said.

22:42.542 --> 22:44.833
What should I hide?

22:47.083 --> 22:49.333
You want to know if I have a girlfriend.

22:59.042 --> 23:02.042
- We go somewhere else.
- We spend this, then leave.

23:05.208 --> 23:06.833
Can you not be noisy?

23:08.958 --> 23:10.833
- What are you laughing at?
- Luisa ...

23:11.375 --> 23:12.625
Hey, you.

23:13.792 --> 23:15.708
- What is so funny?
- Shut up, you old lady.

23:16.208 --> 23:18.583
Don't be angry, Luisa.

23:22.792 --> 23:23.792
What are you saying?

23:23.875 --> 23:26.458
Luisa, we can spend ...

23:26.542 --> 23:29.583
- Do you want to be a hero?
- me? Not. I said nothing.

23:29.667 --> 23:31.708
Maybe we will beat you up.

23:31.833 --> 23:33.708
- You beat me up?
- I didn't say that. He.

23:33.792 --> 23:36.583
- What if it's true?
- Harming a child is illegal.

23:37.125 --> 23:38.542
I'm 18 years old. There is a problem?

23:38.625 --> 23:39.458
Gosh.

23:39.542 --> 23:42.000
Hitting people is basically illegal.

23:42.083 --> 23:43.333
See this finger?

23:43.875 --> 23:46.417
- I'll beat you with a finger.
- Two things.

23:46.500 --> 23:49.333
It's not the index finger, it's the middle finger.

23:49.417 --> 23:51.417
And second, next to that,

23:51.750 --> 23:53.417
You can't beat me

23:53.500 --> 23:55.417
with that finger or with another.

24:01.083 --> 24:02.250
This is the middle finger.

24:03.583 --> 24:04.583
Loser!

24:13.375 --> 24:15.417

24:15.500 --> 24:17.917

26:06.000 --> 26:07.417
Everything is in control.

26:34.917 --> 26:35.917

the birth of the latest technological revolution.

28:55.292 --> 28:59.042
I present family members
our future.

28:59.792 --> 29:00.792
Chitobot.

29:02.458 --> 29:05.458
Your house won't be the same again.

True cleaning, suction, broom, cloth ...

29:09.583 --> 29:13.250
of course with technical perfection
from CHIT.

29:14.333 --> 29:15.792
It's time to take a step.

29:24.500 --> 29:25.500
Ata ...

29:29.125 --> 29:30.125
We found it.

29:30.458 --> 29:33.458
- Are you sure?
- Someone held a train in Spain.

29:42.625 --> 29:43.792
Play the video!

29:46.500 --> 29:47.500
What video?

29:48.708 --> 29:49.708
Spanish?

29:50.042 --> 29:53.792
- What did he do in Spain?
- He stopped the train slipping.

29:53.875 --> 29:55.875
Did anyone pull the emergency brake?

29:55.958 --> 29:58.917
Impossible, we always turn it off
before causing an accident.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.583
- We have pictures in the control room.
- I don't need it.

30:11.458 --> 30:12.708
Nothing to show his face?

30:13.000 --> 30:15.875
This planet is filled with our technology.
He has no way out.

30:16.167 --> 30:17.500
Don't waste time.

30:17.583 --> 30:20.167
Tell my clone there
if I come soon.

30:20.292 --> 30:22.042
And stay alert.

30:22.667 --> 30:26.292
Remember, we are facing a finishing weapon.

30:28.917 --> 30:30.625
Coffee using cream and crooked bread.

30:32.042 --> 30:34.917
There is no coffee and bread.
However, I have cream.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Warm or hot?

30:38.750 --> 30:39.792
Sorry, Sir.

<i> We have exclusive images </ i>

30:59.542 --> 31:02.208
He must have a comet on his back.
You can't be that fast!

31:02.583 --> 31:04.333
Let's work.

31:04.417 --> 31:06.583
We are always distracted by many things.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.958
- You're right, that's not unusual.
- I didn't say that.

31:10.333 --> 31:13.083
You stopped the train going ...
What?

31:13.750 --> 31:16.000
- Explain last night.
- What happened last night?

31:16.083 --> 31:18.875
- Don't pretend with me!
- I didn't stop the train!

31:18.958 --> 31:20.500
- What train?
- What train?

31:20.583 --> 31:22.417
I'm talking about Jaime.

31:23.042 --> 31:24.958
- Strange party last night.
- OK.

31:25.042 --> 31:28.000
See what he gave today.
My personal card.

31:28.083 --> 31:29.250
There are 500.

31:29.625 --> 31:32.917
I don't want to be prejudiced,
but it seems he wants to seduce me.

31:34.417 --> 31:36.917
Luisa, that's how Jaime is.

31:37.417 --> 31:38.625
What do you see?

31:38.708 --> 31:40.375
- It is nothing.
- Let me see.

31:40.458 --> 31:41.625
- It is nothing!
- What is that?

31:41.708 --> 31:43.000
Luisa, it's nothing.

31:43.583 --> 31:45.125
That garbage.

31:45.625 --> 31:47.917
You can see from afar
if it's engineering.

31:48.333 --> 31:51.417
People with super powers in Spain?

31:51.500 --> 31:52.792
Shut up, it's sad.

31:54.125 --> 31:55.500
Not so sad, right?

31:55.583 --> 31:59.375
Juan, superhero appears and he
Spanish people, that's the most stupid thing.

31:59.750 --> 32:01.417
Superheroes must be Americans,

32:01.917 --> 32:03.583
English, or Japanese.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.750
Was he born in Arguijuela de Todos
los Santos, Province of Caceres?

32:06.833 --> 32:08.125
- No, Juan.
- Luisa ...

32:09.167 --> 32:11.208
Imagine, not you and me ...

32:11.292 --> 32:13.625
However, if there are people
that is so altruistic ...

32:13.958 --> 32:17.000
willing to endanger his life
to save the lives of many ...

32:17.083 --> 32:20.375
No, Juan. There are things that don't match.
Heroes and Spanish, no.

32:20.667 --> 32:22.875
Germany, maybe.
He could be a German.

32:23.042 --> 32:26.125
However, Spain? Don't make me laugh.
Who is the opponent? On time?

32:27.667 --> 32:30.292
Maybe he is not a superhero.

32:30.500 --> 32:31.958
Maybe he is someone special.

32:32.125 --> 32:33.417
You suck today.

32:33.583 --> 32:35.958
Go on, and I won't eat
with you tonight.

32:36.125 --> 32:37.667
- Dinner together?
- There is a problem?

32:37.750 --> 32:41.875
- What are you talking about?
- There is no. Work.

32:42.250 --> 32:43.917
Then, you haven't heard.

32:45.208 --> 32:47.125
"Muller's words came to Spain.

32:53.333 --> 32:55.917
However, yes, indeed he sells

35:11.708 --> 35:13.417
I am a patron here.

35:16.500 --> 35:17.708
- understand?
- yes.

35:23.292 --> 35:24.625
Hi, Luisa. Had reached?

35:24.875 --> 35:27.542
Yes, half an hour ago. I knew it.

35:27.625 --> 35:30.292
I'm on the bus.
Three or four minutes to arrive.

35:30.708 --> 35:32.292

36:00.792 --> 36:01.792
Who are you?

36:03.208 --> 36:04.542
I? I'm Pedro Luis.

36:04.625 --> 36:06.708
Don't respond.
Don't you see the situation?

36:07.208 --> 36:09.250
<i> Don't be afraid. I'm your friend. </ I></i>

36:09.333 --> 36:12.333
Can you please stop the bus?
I have to go down here.

36:13.583 --> 36:15.208
You scared my dog.

36:15.292 --> 36:16.417
Can't you see?

36:16.792 --> 36:18.792
Driver, bring him down! He is crazy!

36:18.875 --> 36:21.042
<i> I have to tell you two things. </ i></i>

36:21.125 --> 36:23.708
God, stop it! My head can break!

36:24.000 --> 36:27.583
<i> First, don't talk to me. </ i>
<i> I can't hear you. </ i></i></i>

36:31.917 --> 36:32.917
Forget it.

36:33.625 --> 36:36.583
<i> Second, you have to come see me. </ i></i>

36:39.167 --> 36:40.708
<i> I'm atagata Muller. </ i></i>

36:41.625 --> 36:43.458
<i> Let's talk privately. </ i></i>

36:49.542 --> 36:51.458

36:51.792 --> 36:54.333
<i> However, calm down. I'm here. </ I>
<i> to explain everything. </ i></i></i>

36:54.542 --> 36:55.708
Shut up!

36:55.792 --> 36:58.833
<i> I don't know why for so long you appeared. </ i></i>

36:58.917 --> 37:00.375
OK, I will come!

37:00.458 --> 37:01.833
<i> Don't be afraid. </ i></i>

37:01.917 --> 37:04.917
<i> I know your secret </ i>

37:05.000 --> 37:06.083
CHIT

37:06.167 --> 37:08.125
<i> Welcome to CHIT Technology. </ i></i>

37:11.708 --> 37:13.250
We are waiting for you.

37:30.750 --> 37:31.750
Hello?

37:34.083 --> 37:36.208
Sorry, but I'm in a hurry.

37:39.250 --> 37:41.708
You don't know how long
I'm waiting now.

37:43.042 --> 37:44.625
You're the woman's vacuum cleaner.

37:44.708 --> 37:47.875
Thirty years.
All my life hoping to find you.

37:48.167 --> 37:50.625
Please sit. We must celebrate this.

37:50.708 --> 37:53.417
What should be celebrated?
I don't know you at all.

37:53.583 --> 37:56.542
I know from TV. I have your blend.

37:56.625 --> 37:59.875
What are you doing underground
on that night it was very spectacular.

37:59.958 --> 38:04.167
Wait. I have nothing to do
with what happened underground.

38:05.917 --> 38:07.500
You don't need to pretend with me.

38:07.583 --> 38:09.083
- I like you.
- Of course.

38:09.500 --> 38:12.292
My salary is one thousand a month, during the contract period,
you're a millionaire. Similar!

38:12.375 --> 38:14.583
- We are from the same planet.
- From Masnou?

38:14.833 --> 38:19.500
Further. We cannot last a lifetime
pretend like them.

38:19.625 --> 38:21.917
- Do you know what I mean?
- Not.

38:22.250 --> 38:25.500
You say I'm like an alien.

38:26.083 --> 38:27.625
That's what I mean.

38:27.708 --> 38:29.125
Yes, right, so funny.

38:29.292 --> 38:31.083
When you return to Planet X ...

38:31.167 --> 38:34.500
deliver greetings to ET, Alf, and
Zoltar from me.

38:34.583 --> 38:38.125
Other people cannot melt things
with his eyes or run away so fast!

38:38.208 --> 38:40.375
Ordinary people can't stop the train.

38:44.583 --> 38:45.708
Look, two things.

38:45.792 --> 38:47.708
One, I don't do that.

38:47.792 --> 38:49.708
Two ... how do you know?

38:49.792 --> 38:52.917
I can take you
to where you can be normal.

38:53.125 --> 38:55.333
We will go home with my father.

38:55.417 --> 38:58.042
Yes, of course, riding a flying saucer.

38:58.292 --> 39:01.458
I'm not the person you're looking for. After all,
I was late for dinner.

39:01.792 --> 39:02.792
Wait.

39:06.333 --> 39:07.625
That's the reason!

39:08.375 --> 39:10.667
You want to stay for him.
Who is she?

39:12.583 --> 39:13.583
Did you read my mind?

39:14.458 --> 39:16.917
I tried to convince you
in an easy way.

39:17.792 --> 39:18.833
An easy way?

39:18.917 --> 39:20.750
You stayed here until my father arrived.

39:21.708 --> 39:22.708
Let go!

39:23.167 --> 39:24.167
Let go!

39:29.250 --> 39:30.708
Look at my clothes!

39:37.125 --> 39:39.250
Sorry, but look what you did
on my clothes.

39:41.750 --> 39:44.542
I know you are indeed his son Jan.

40:05.333 --> 40:06.333
What is this?

40:07.708 --> 40:08.542
Finish him!

40:08.625 --> 40:10.833
Friend, this is just a misunderstanding.
I just want...

40:11.667 --> 40:12.500
Sorry.

40:16.708 --> 40:17.708
You dropped ...

40:21.083 --> 40:22.292
Sorry.

40:56.083 --> 40:57.750
Ata even, stop this!

41:04.875 --> 41:06.042
Stop this!

41:13.167 --> 41:14.542
Catch him!

41:14.625 --> 41:16.750
- Where is she?
- Where is she?

41:18.375 --> 41:19.708
- That!
- Who caught it?

41:21.000 --> 41:22.208
He ran away! There!

41:22.708 --> 41:25.917
You can run away from here,
but not from who you are.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.292
Stop bothering me
with the hum.

41:28.375 --> 41:29.708
That's really uncomfortable.

41:47.917 --> 41:50.917
- We won't let him out.
- There is no point.

41:51.417 --> 41:53.167
Besides, I know his weaknesses.

41:53.917 --> 41:57.125
His name is Luisa Lanas.
I want the DNA.

42:01.792 --> 42:03.000
DANGER!

42:29.583 --> 42:31.125
CHECK

42:32.708 --> 42:34.833
SAMPLE FOUND
TYPE: DNA, SUBJECT: LUISA LANAS

42:39.833 --> 42:40.750
ANALYSIS OF DNA

42:42.375 --> 42:45.167
SCREEN

43:16.667 --> 43:17.500
Stupid thing!

43:22.875 --> 43:26.125
Not stupid. Small medium tool.

43:26.958 --> 43:29.208
Or as I usually say,
household appliances.

43:29.583 --> 43:31.750
Hey, calm down.

43:35.500 --> 43:36.500
Naughty stuff!

43:37.500 --> 43:38.500
Not.

43:38.792 --> 43:41.542
Well! Not!

43:48.042 --> 43:49.042
Calm down, huh?

44:00.083 --> 44:01.000
Back off!

44:01.708 --> 44:03.292
Retreat, insect base!

44:03.792 --> 44:05.083
Sit!

44:07.917 --> 44:11.500
Hey, you guys! Help me! Messed up!
This robot wants to kill me!

44:11.833 --> 44:12.833
Come on!

44:13.583 --> 44:15.875
What are you doing?
Come and destroy this!

44:16.250 --> 44:17.417
Come on!

44:20.792 --> 44:22.042
Hit it!

44:26.083 --> 44:27.083
Continue!

44:34.000 --> 44:37.125
Don't tell anyone.
Also about that hug.

44:45.458 --> 44:47.042
100% FINISHED

44:48.375 --> 44:49.542
DNA SENDED

44:56.125 --> 44:57.500
Come on, Luisa, lift up!

44:57.583 --> 44:59.583
Answer. Please, lift up.

44:59.667 --> 45:00.583
Juan.

45:03.250 --> 45:05.542
- Luisa, where are you from?
- From where?

45:05.625 --> 45:08.000
Where are you Dress like that ...

45:08.083 --> 45:10.208
I went to the restaurant, but you weren't there.

45:10.292 --> 45:12.583
Yes, and wait another hour for you.

45:13.042 --> 45:14.833
Just say it if you don't want to
have dinner with me.

45:14.917 --> 45:18.875
Don't want to eat with you?
Of course I really want to.

45:19.000 --> 45:22.458
- However, crazy things happened to me.
- crazier than making me wait?

45:23.375 --> 45:24.833
- yes.
- What?

45:25.542 --> 45:27.667
I'm not so sure.

45:28.583 --> 45:29.917
Luisa, what are you doing?

45:30.792 --> 45:33.375
If I drink more,
maybe I can trust you.

45:34.500 --> 45:35.333
See.

45:36.375 --> 45:37.750
- Jaime again.
- Don't lift it!

45:38.000 --> 45:39.083
- Why?
- just in case.

45:39.167 --> 45:40.875
- Just in case?
- That...

45:42.167 --> 45:43.750
Damn, the signal is bad.

45:45.750 --> 45:47.125
This ... Luisa, listen ...

45:47.750 --> 45:50.375
I know what I will say
sounds weird,

45:50.458 --> 45:51.875
then I'll just say it straight away.

45:52.708 --> 45:57.125
I just caught a vacuum cleaner robot
send your DNA to someone.

45:57.208 --> 45:59.375
Please, when you hear my message,
contact me.

45:59.458 --> 46:02.000
I will come by the robot
so you believe.

46:03.083 --> 46:05.042
I know your address from the cover letter.

46:05.125 --> 46:06.917
I don't see the email address
or Facebook.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.667
Don't be suspicious of me,
like your friend Laurita86.

46:11.625 --> 46:12.458
Shit.

46:12.542 --> 46:13.750
Come on, apologize.

46:14.000 --> 46:18.417
Luisa, I really want to tell you,
but it took several days to understand.

46:18.500 --> 46:22.167
If I say it straight away, you must think
I am crazy. However, it's not like crazy.

46:22.250 --> 46:23.417
Crazy "weird".

46:23.500 --> 46:26.125
Better tell now
when I'm drunk.

46:26.208 --> 46:28.833
This wine is very expensive
and I have to spend it.

46:29.208 --> 46:32.000
- Luisa, I can't tell you.
- Why?

46:32.083 --> 46:34.542
Because I have to talk to my parents.

46:34.625 --> 46:35.625
- Your parents?
- yes.

46:35.708 --> 46:37.375
- How old are you, 12 years old?
- yes. Not!

46:37.458 --> 46:40.542
Stop it, Juan. We know what
what actually happened.

46:40.750 --> 46:43.750
You know, I know, so does Rober.

46:43.917 --> 46:46.542
It's been years,
but we still like each other.

46:46.750 --> 46:47.833
Always.

46:48.208 --> 46:50.708
So, don't talk anymore
and come with me.

46:51.292 --> 46:55.250
Luisa, if a woman like you asks me
to come along, I will be like a buffalo.

46:55.625 --> 46:58.667
I want to, but nobody ever
invited me before.

46:58.958 --> 47:01.042
However, if I do something
with you tonight,

47:01.125 --> 47:03.542
it can make me
be the worst person in the world.

47:04.708 --> 47:06.167
What are you doing, leave?

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
Hey!

47:08.208 --> 47:09.208
Hey!

47:09.833 --> 47:11.417
OK, go!

47:11.958 --> 47:14.958
Go to your parents
and have them make a glass of chocolate!

47:15.458 --> 47:18.250
What else should I do
so you want to sleep with me?

47:18.958 --> 47:22.833
You're like a child!
Return to the playground, coward!

47:58.167 --> 47:59.750
I'm really drunk.

48:08.417 --> 48:09.667
Where will you take it?

48:11.583 --> 48:12.958
The technical service is very fast.

48:24.917 --> 48:28.083
What's between you and that woman?

48:29.208 --> 48:30.750
He is not so great.

48:31.708 --> 48:34.083
If you help me,
Luisa can be yours.

49:06.958 --> 49:09.958
Already guessed When viewing news,
dad knew right away.

49:10.375 --> 49:11.208
Come in.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.708
What do you want me to do?

49:16.125 --> 49:18.750
Daddy told your mother,
you're not a stupid kid.

49:18.833 --> 49:20.208
I'm a little overrated.

49:20.417 --> 49:22.833
It's not a big thing if I stop
train every 30 years.

49:22.917 --> 49:24.833
You should act
like a normal person.

49:24.917 --> 49:27.750
However, I'm not normal, Father.
Father and Mother know that.

49:27.833 --> 49:30.292
- boy! What do you want?
- Want to know the truth.

49:30.375 --> 49:33.958
No, you want to fry eggs and bakon
or shredded meat?

49:34.042 --> 49:36.250
- You look thin, kid.
- I don't want anything.

49:36.542 --> 49:37.667
One thing.

49:38.083 --> 49:41.000
I want you to answer
one simple question.

49:41.167 --> 49:42.333
- please.
- please.

49:42.708 --> 49:45.458
Please tell me
if you are my parents.

49:49.875 --> 49:53.125
Don't stay quiet! Speak up
This atmosphere makes me tense!

49:53.292 --> 49:56.625
Tense? This is because of travel.
You're tired. Take a break.

49:56.708 --> 49:59.000
Of course we are your parents.
What's the matter?

49:59.375 --> 50:02.750
Let's talk about my birthday.
How long did you give birth to me?

50:04.583 --> 50:07.292
- Don't remember.
- What do you mean by mom? I'm an only child!

50:07.375 --> 50:09.042
Your mother and father don't remember.

50:09.125 --> 50:11.208
It's been a long time. What happened to you?

50:12.125 --> 50:13.167
I met someone.

50:13.375 --> 50:14.583
- woman?
- no.

50:15.875 --> 50:18.250
Someone who said things
which is very strange.

50:18.417 --> 50:20.167
It's a woman, but that's another issue.

50:20.875 --> 50:22.917
He said he wanted to take me home.

50:23.292 --> 50:26.542
But not here. To another galaxy!

50:26.625 --> 50:28.042
Don't say it's because of marijuana.

50:28.125 --> 50:30.542
It's been a long time and only a little.

50:30.792 --> 50:34.500
So, please say,
Am I from another galaxy or not?

50:36.792 --> 50:38.542
If you don't stop the train ...

50:39.375 --> 50:41.917
So, right. This is truly amazing!

50:42.042 --> 50:45.917
I'll tell you one thing. So mean
You don't tell me about this.

50:46.000 --> 50:47.792
Son, for mom you are like another child.

50:47.875 --> 50:50.542
Yes, but with a little difference.
I'm an alien!

50:50.625 --> 50:52.417
Nobody needs to know.

50:52.500 --> 50:54.458
They tried to kidnap me, Daddy!

50:54.750 --> 50:56.042
They will try again.

50:56.125 --> 50:57.583
Now you have to eat a lot.

50:58.083 --> 51:00.417
You're too thin to face
galaxy forces.

51:00.500 --> 51:02.458
Maria, never mind.
Enough with movie-smelling problems.

51:04.125 --> 51:05.208
It's time for you to see.

51:06.792 --> 51:09.083
Juan, we promise we won't do it.

51:09.167 --> 51:10.583
What do you see? You scared me.

51:15.292 --> 51:17.000
- Come here.
- Come on in, kid.

51:28.167 --> 51:29.208
Ready?

51:35.333 --> 51:37.500
Remember something?

51:38.333 --> 51:39.958
Tell me this isn't what I think.

51:40.667 --> 51:43.000
You come inside this.
We don't know where.

51:43.250 --> 51:45.750
This is definitely not from Martorell.

51:45.833 --> 51:48.583
- What do you want us to do?
- Father wants to contact the police.

51:48.667 --> 51:50.792
- He who wants ...
- Police. Nice.

51:51.208 --> 51:53.667
You are role models. Congratulations.

51:54.042 --> 51:55.167
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

52:05.875 --> 52:07.917
<i> - Hello, kid. </ i>
- Beware.</i>

52:08.000 --> 52:10.208
<i> If you see this, </ i>
<i> things have become complicated </ i></i></i>

52:10.292 --> 52:11.875
<i> and we send you far from Chitón. </ i></i>

52:12.292 --> 52:15.125
<i> However, thanks to your extraordinary abilities, </ i></i>

52:15.208 --> 52:17.667
<i> father feels you activated this mechanism </ i></i>

52:17.750 --> 52:20.917
<i> at the age of three or four years. </ i></i>

52:21.292 --> 52:22.792
I already have a feeling.

52:22.875 --> 52:27.250
<i> However, this is hard to explain, </ i>
<i> then dad will use these two dolls. </ i></i></i>

52:27.458 --> 52:28.625
<i> This is Skorba. </ i></i>

52:28.917 --> 52:30.000
<i> "I Skorba! </ i></i>

52:30.208 --> 52:33.833
<i> I am very evil and whole </ i>
<i> Chitón residents are under my control. "</ i></i></i>

52:34.167 --> 52:36.333
<i> And this is me, your father. </ i></i>

52:36.542 --> 52:37.708
<i> "I won't let it go! </ i></i>

52:37.958 --> 52:41.333
<i> With my knowledge, I will create it </ i>
<i> perfect weapon to defeat you! "</ i></i></i>

52:41.625 --> 52:44.458
<i> I hope you understand who you are. </ i></i>

52:45.667 --> 52:47.125
Yes, I really understand.

52:47.583 --> 52:49.333
<i> "You can't beat me with anything!" </ i></i>

52:49.417 --> 52:52.042
<i> "This is not an ordinary weapon, </ i>
<i> this is a finishing weapon. </ i></i></i>

52:52.125 --> 52:55.625
<i> When my child is born, </ i>
<i> the wind will appear from his mouth, </ i></i></i>

52:55.708 --> 52:57.083
<i> fire from his eyes. </ i></i>

52:57.167 --> 52:58.917
<i> He will be as fast as lightning. </ i></i>

52:59.000 --> 53:01.875
<i> And by flying through the galaxy, </ i>
<i> he will destroy your empire. "</ i></i></i>

53:02.458 --> 53:04.958
- Said, I fly?
<i> - Skorba will look for you. </ i></i>

53:05.292 --> 53:06.542
<i> "Where did your child go? </ i></i>

53:07.000 --> 53:08.375
<i> Left or right? "</ i></i>

53:09.167 --> 53:10.458
<i> Left? Right? </ I></i>

53:10.750 --> 53:11.750
He answered.

53:12.167 --> 53:14.083
<i> Son, this is an interactive hologram. </ i></i>

53:14.458 --> 53:16.250
<i> You have to answer right or left. </ i></i>

53:16.542 --> 53:19.333
Until you answer,
the "phonogram" can't continue.

53:19.917 --> 53:21.083
Right.

53:21.208 --> 53:22.542
<i> Good, you said right. </ i></i>

53:22.625 --> 53:25.292
<i> That means you are still small </ i>
<i> and don't know anything. </ i></i></i>

53:25.875 --> 53:29.583
<i> It's about tricking Skorba, </ i>
<i> not throw you away. </ i></i></i>

53:29.875 --> 53:33.917
<i> However, never mind, you have to grow up </ i>
<i> to reach the level of adult intelligence. </ i></i></i>

53:34.000 --> 53:36.042
<i> Don't worry, one day you will be ready. </ i></i>

53:36.417 --> 53:38.583
<i> If that time arrives, </ i>
<i> enter the rocket </ i></i></i>

53:38.958 --> 53:41.958
<i> that will take you back </ i>
<i> to save us. </ i></i></i>

53:43.458 --> 53:44.958
<i> You are our only hope. </ i></i>

53:50.625 --> 53:53.958
This message must have been from ancient times.

53:54.208 --> 53:57.583
They must have a way
to solve their problems.

53:59.083 --> 54:01.292
Don't tell anyone
about this.

54:01.583 --> 54:04.333
Especially Uncle Tonin. Three,
and he leaked everything.

54:04.417 --> 54:07.375
Daddy won't say,
but they are waiting for you there.

54:07.625 --> 54:10.667
Right, and this tyrant attack
is my mistake.

54:10.833 --> 54:13.500
They must also have acted.
I have to hear their version.

54:14.042 --> 54:16.542
It's very easy to judge people
from another galaxy.

54:16.917 --> 54:18.083
Mother, don't touch it.

54:18.333 --> 54:20.375
Finally, the descendants of López have
important role.

54:20.458 --> 54:23.500
I once repaired Sito Pons motorcycle.
I know it's not a big thing, but ...

54:23.583 --> 54:27.375
This month feels bad to me.
I have to send goods, mortgage ...

54:27.500 --> 54:29.750
What they will do
tax report for me ...

54:29.833 --> 54:32.333
oppressed population of Chitán,
Chitón, or whatever?

54:33.417 --> 54:35.667
- Everyone is responsible for himself.
- No, boy!

54:35.750 --> 54:37.750
Not! They say
you're their last hope.

54:37.833 --> 54:40.458
- Yes, I don't believe that!
- Watch your mouth!

54:40.542 --> 54:43.542
How can I go into space
without insurance or something?

54:43.625 --> 54:45.875
Besides, Dad always told me
not to stand out.

54:46.250 --> 54:49.833
Right, but because now we know
be true to yourself, don't act otherwise.

54:51.083 --> 54:53.458
First, speak clearly.
Father is incomprehensible.

54:53.625 --> 54:55.000
Second, I leave here.

54:56.250 --> 54:58.833
Son, just in case,
I'll make you clothes from this.

54:58.917 --> 55:02.083
- The fabric is good.
- I won't wear anything.

55:02.208 --> 55:05.125
Superheroes can't hang around
wear ordinary clothes.

55:05.208 --> 55:06.792
The superhero isn't real!

55:06.875 --> 55:10.792
What do we know? Look, I'm going to sew
and you can try it.

55:10.875 --> 55:14.417
- I'm really happy ...
- I don't want to wear any costumes!

55:31.208 --> 55:33.167
Are you reluctant to say anything?

55:33.417 --> 55:35.375
It's so bad that dad can't laugh.

55:35.792 --> 55:38.833
That's a good hero costume.

55:38.917 --> 55:41.500
With a wig, he can be a mockery
for the Mardi Gras festival.

55:41.583 --> 55:44.792
- I'll take it off.
- No, come here. Wait.

55:44.875 --> 55:49.333
Maybe if you put a pin here,
or shoulder pads ...

55:49.417 --> 55:51.958
- There can't be a cushion!
- He looks like a compactor.

55:52.042 --> 55:54.083
He only needs flutes, dogs,
and brown bread.

55:54.375 --> 55:55.750
Listen father. Say something.

55:55.833 --> 55:58.125
Washed several times
will shrink the fabric to fit.

55:58.417 --> 56:00.875
- Besides, you can still grow.
- Yes, of course.

56:00.958 --> 56:03.667
Listen, mom copied it from the Superman movie.

56:04.000 --> 56:07.250
If it's cold, use it here.
Can be useful to be a scarf.

56:07.333 --> 56:10.167
No, this means robes.
This is for flying.

56:10.250 --> 56:11.333
So, can you fly?

56:12.167 --> 56:13.000
It seems like that.

56:13.083 --> 56:15.333
The person on the plane said fire
and fly.

56:15.417 --> 56:18.333
The person on the plane is my father.

56:18.417 --> 56:20.000
- He has a name.
- What is his name?

56:20.958 --> 56:21.958
I do not know.

56:23.667 --> 56:26.417
I am also your father,
and my name is Juan Antonio López.

56:26.500 --> 56:28.500
Dad told you to learn to fly.

56:28.583 --> 56:31.125
You might need it later.
You never know.

56:31.375 --> 56:34.083
Yes, of course, learn to fly.
How to?

56:42.000 --> 56:44.125
Someone from town will see me
like this!

56:44.542 --> 56:47.375
Come on, now is the time.
Try flying!

56:47.458 --> 56:49.958
Try flying. It's easy!

56:50.042 --> 56:53.750
Shake your hands
and be careful with trees.

56:53.833 --> 56:56.292
- I see! Go on!
- Let him concentrate.

56:57.917 --> 56:59.292
Beat wider!

57:00.042 --> 57:03.333
- Like this.
- Don't get too tight. Again!

57:04.083 --> 57:05.292
- I see.
- It didn't work.

57:05.667 --> 57:07.792
Why did he even clench?

57:07.875 --> 57:09.167
There he is!

57:09.250 --> 57:10.375
- Try it!
- Continue!

57:12.875 --> 57:14.333
This doesn't work.

57:14.417 --> 57:16.458
I think you have to jump.

57:16.542 --> 57:19.042
Yes, jump. And my head will be destroyed!

57:19.125 --> 57:20.875
Maybe flying will succeed in the air.

57:21.208 --> 57:23.583
Believe in yourself like us.

57:23.667 --> 57:25.750
- There he is.
- I know you can fly!

57:26.083 --> 57:28.042
Retreat, give space.

57:45.708 --> 57:47.125
Gosh, he fell down.

57:47.333 --> 57:49.542
Son, are you okay?

57:50.750 --> 57:53.583
Look at how you got up. It was great.

57:53.667 --> 57:54.792
Is anyone sick?

57:57.208 --> 58:00.375
- It's my fault to obey you.
- However, later you will be able to.

58:00.458 --> 58:02.625
Later you will jump!

58:03.208 --> 58:05.375
No, I said nothing was difficult
for this.

58:05.458 --> 58:09.167
You're just a little wrong.
You just have to do it right.

58:18.375 --> 58:20.458
Crazy. You are crazy.

58:22.292 --> 58:25.417
Watch out. You talk to hope
another galaxy.

58:25.625 --> 58:28.208
- strange galaxy?
- You wear underwear!

58:29.417 --> 58:31.375
This is not underwear!

58:31.625 --> 58:35.125
Maybe I should beat you up,
and see who is the winner.

58:35.208 --> 58:37.500
Will you beat us with your hands?

58:37.583 --> 58:39.000
Is "S" for "The Feminine"?

58:39.667 --> 58:40.708
Or "Subnormal"?

58:40.792 --> 58:42.333
Or "Suck sausages"?

58:49.542 --> 58:51.750
Why? You don't laugh anymore?

58:53.833 --> 58:55.250
- run away.
- run away!

59:01.125 --> 59:02.750
God!

59:04.083 --> 59:05.917
Juan, look! Look, Juan!

59:06.458 --> 59:08.625
- He doesn't fly, but drifts!
- Geez!

59:08.708 --> 59:10.458
- Santa Teresa!
- Who is from Kolkata?

59:10.542 --> 59:12.083
No, Avila. This is a miracle!

59:22.208 --> 59:24.875
- There's no way your students can do this.
- Where is he going?

59:58.875 --> 01:00:01.208
- Do you know where this is?
- Sa Cala de Marbres.

01:00:01.542 --> 01:00:02.542
Where?

01:00:02.625 --> 01:00:03.667
Mallorca.

01:00:04.917 --> 01:00:06.125
Mallorca?

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.125
Is the party a little excessive?

01:00:22.417 --> 01:00:23.417
Shit!

01:00:42.208 --> 01:00:45.167
You take Jalan Txatxarramendi,
through Legorreta and Kastelleta,

01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:47.667
then at Amorebieta, you take the A-8,
then just go straight.

01:00:47.875 --> 01:00:48.875
Watch Out.

01:00:49.083 --> 01:00:53.250
The first city you see is
Yiurreta, you damn it. Must be stuck in traffic.

01:00:53.542 --> 01:00:55.667
You turn back to Ibaneta,

01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:58.500
take a shortcut from Goitzueta
to Txoritokieta,

01:00:58.667 --> 01:01:01.417
then head to A-8 after Guantxoritzketa.

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:03.125
Very far detour path.

01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:05.583
Understood, or should I explain again?

01:01:06.542 --> 01:01:08.667
It's very clear.

01:01:14.583 --> 01:01:16.292
God!

01:02:02.708 --> 01:02:04.833
Mother, this is definitely very ridiculous.

01:02:04.917 --> 01:02:07.625
- The protrusion will not be visible.
- Of course not...

01:02:07.708 --> 01:02:10.250
You can wear it all year long.
This won't stand out.

01:02:10.333 --> 01:02:11.667
I sweat in the summer.

01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:13.167
- Not!
- Don't be stubborn.

01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:15.292
When involved in galaxy battles,

01:02:15.375 --> 01:02:17.500
just torn your clothes like this.

01:02:17.583 --> 01:02:18.833
It's always impressive.

01:02:18.917 --> 01:02:21.125
I don't want to tear clothes
that I bought.

01:02:21.208 --> 01:02:22.375
- Do not want.
- Juanito ...

01:02:33.833 --> 01:02:35.917
- Does Juan live here?
- Not.

01:02:36.167 --> 01:02:38.292
Are you sure?
Jaime said, she lives here.

01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:39.750
Luisa?

01:02:41.333 --> 01:02:42.458
What are you doing here?

01:02:43.333 --> 01:02:45.083
I already know everything.
Impossible not to come.

01:02:47.625 --> 01:02:50.500
Calm down, he's from this galaxy.

01:02:51.333 --> 01:02:54.083
Want to eat? You look so thin.

01:02:54.167 --> 01:02:56.833
- Mother, never mind.
- Sorry. We are a little nervous.

01:02:56.917 --> 01:02:59.125
This is the first time Juan has brought a woman.

01:02:59.875 --> 01:03:02.292
That's the information we need.

01:03:02.375 --> 01:03:04.250
I don't think of you as innate.

01:03:04.333 --> 01:03:06.292
- I don't mean ...
- Daddy, never mind!

01:03:06.542 --> 01:03:09.583
We know what it means to be "friends" now.

01:03:10.333 --> 01:03:13.083
Like cold drinks?
Maria, make lemonade for them.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
OK.

01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:17.208
- Why didn't you tell me last night?
- I do not know.

01:03:17.708 --> 01:03:21.583
- I'm afraid it's considered strange.
- However, this is good, Juan.

01:03:21.667 --> 01:03:23.292
This is amazing.

01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:25.167
How do you know?

01:03:26.583 --> 01:03:28.583
Are you okay, Luisa? Your eyes...

01:03:28.667 --> 01:03:29.917
- my eyes?
- Your eyes.

01:03:30.792 --> 01:03:34.208
This is because of joy.
I know everything and I think it's good.

01:03:34.833 --> 01:03:37.167
They say they want to help you go home.

01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:39.167
Did you meet a woman vacuum cleaner?

01:03:39.833 --> 01:03:42.875
Yes. He is very worried about you.

01:03:42.958 --> 01:03:45.458
Wait. Maybe he didn't say
if he tries to kidnap me.

01:03:45.542 --> 01:03:48.625
Yes. He is just as nervous as you.

01:03:49.083 --> 01:03:50.667
As a result of finding you and ...

01:03:51.667 --> 01:03:54.833
he asked me to apologize
because of being rude.

01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:00.958
Wait, you don't trust me? I'm Luisa.
What am I cheating for?

01:04:01.250 --> 01:04:03.667
Luisa, you are acting weird.
How about last night?

01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:04.833
- Last night?
- yes.

01:04:04.917 --> 01:04:05.958
- Last night?
- Last night.

01:04:06.708 --> 01:04:08.625
<i> This is just as important, </ i>
<i> even more, than this. </ i></i></i>

01:04:08.708 --> 01:04:10.500
Certain. Overnight...

01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:13.500
... many things happened.

01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:15.458
I don't know what you mean.

01:04:15.542 --> 01:04:20.417
Ask him if this is more important
rather than betraying a friend. Ask!

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.167
What does it mean?
What happened last night?

01:04:24.125 --> 01:04:25.583
What happened?

01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:27.250
I know.

01:04:33.333 --> 01:04:35.708
No need to think about it, Juan.

01:04:35.875 --> 01:04:38.458
It was just an ordinary kiss at the door.

01:04:38.542 --> 01:04:40.500
Ordinary? What's this about?

01:04:40.583 --> 01:04:43.333
Maybe you think making out at the door
that means we are dating.

01:04:43.417 --> 01:04:47.042
Now you will go to Raticulin,
or whatever galaxy it is. What is your plan?

01:04:47.125 --> 01:04:49.875
Weekends together alternately
in each galaxy?

01:04:49.958 --> 01:04:53.583
- You're a bad kisser, I'll tell you.
- However, I said I don't want to go!

01:04:53.917 --> 01:04:55.708
I let go of the chance hat
be your girlfriend

01:04:56.250 --> 01:04:58.875
and wear the inhabitants of the planet.

01:04:59.583 --> 01:05:02.375
You think we can stay here
do strange things?

01:05:02.458 --> 01:05:03.500
This is not strange.

01:05:03.583 --> 01:05:04.625
<i> This is super power. </ i></i>

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:09.500
Never mind. Don't call that superpowers.
Only super vision and hearing.

01:05:09.708 --> 01:05:10.875
<i> Also X-rays in my eyes. </ i></i>

01:05:11.125 --> 01:05:13.417
Good, vision, hearing
super, and X-rays.

01:05:13.792 --> 01:05:16.250
<i> - I can fly. </ i>
- Can you fly too?</i>

01:05:16.792 --> 01:05:18.750
- Also super power.
- Do you know?

01:05:18.833 --> 01:05:20.208
Jaime also has super powers.

01:05:20.292 --> 01:05:21.583
He is super smart.

01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:25.292
He knows about us
because it smelled from a long distance.

01:05:25.375 --> 01:05:28.542
At least he feels it.
He became head of HR not without reason.

01:05:28.625 --> 01:05:30.458
- Because he knows people.
- I know.

01:05:30.542 --> 01:05:33.833
Plus, he is your friend.
You know he likes me very much.

01:05:33.917 --> 01:05:35.833
And he has group friends.

01:05:35.917 --> 01:05:39.125
- Do you think I don't care?
- Not so when we are at the door.

01:05:39.292 --> 01:05:41.083
Now you know what happened to me.

01:05:41.167 --> 01:05:44.625
You know that is difficult for me
to get friends.

01:05:45.417 --> 01:05:48.292
Jaime always says, she's my boss and friend.

01:05:48.917 --> 01:05:51.875
Technically he's not my boss, but ...

01:05:52.875 --> 01:05:54.333
he will always be my friend.

01:05:55.833 --> 01:05:57.417
And you're right, Luisa.

01:05:58.750 --> 01:06:00.208
I have to talk to him first.

01:06:00.750 --> 01:06:02.458
I love Jaime very much.

01:06:04.125 --> 01:06:05.500
And he's my only friend.

01:06:16.333 --> 01:06:18.750
Don't let you believe his words.

01:06:22.375 --> 01:06:25.458
OK. We will arrest him
with my way.

01:06:33.292 --> 01:06:36.083
It seems you don't understand everything
what i said ...

01:06:40.667 --> 01:06:42.208
Do you like that way?

01:06:42.583 --> 01:06:44.833
I don't really like it,
but have never done it.

01:06:44.917 --> 01:06:47.750
However, because I haven't tried it yet,
maybe if we do and that ...

01:06:49.625 --> 01:06:51.750
Juanito!

01:06:52.042 --> 01:06:53.125
Juanito!

01:06:53.417 --> 01:06:55.667
- What happened?
- What is wrong?

01:06:56.167 --> 01:06:57.917
Mother's child. Are you ok?

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.375
You fighting? You start too fast!

01:07:09.333 --> 01:07:10.417
What is wrong with him?

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:16.833
- That woman is not good for you.
- Get out of the way.

01:07:18.542 --> 01:07:19.833
That's not a woman.

01:07:22.042 --> 01:07:24.750
- Look, daddy. This is not easy!
- Here, my nails are sharp.

01:07:25.167 --> 01:07:26.833
- Look at him!
- He is approaching! Fast!

01:07:26.917 --> 01:07:28.375
He is coming!

01:07:28.458 --> 01:07:30.250
- Take off your pants.
- Pull in that direction.

01:07:30.333 --> 01:07:32.375
Stop it, or I won't be able to
do it yourself!

01:07:32.458 --> 01:07:34.542
Come on, kid! Show yourself exactly!

01:07:34.625 --> 01:07:35.875
- Who am I?
- I don't know!

01:07:35.958 --> 01:07:38.042
Take off your pants!

01:07:38.125 --> 01:07:39.125
Pull!

01:07:39.208 --> 01:07:40.708
- He is coming!
- He is coming.

01:07:44.917 --> 01:07:47.792
Step aside! Stay there. Let me take care of him.

01:08:36.125 --> 01:08:38.707
- wait.
- Maria, be careful.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.292
What did you do to my child?
You bad woman!

01:08:42.667 --> 01:08:45.582
Hurt my child? Don't touch him!
Woman versus woman!

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.042
Woman versus woman!

01:08:50.332 --> 01:08:53.082
- Let go of my wife!
- Don't involve my mother!

01:09:05.375 --> 01:09:09.125
Jaime, we need the real Luisa.

01:09:09.207 --> 01:09:12.917
No, I've done my part.
You don't need me now.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.582
Anyway, I'm leaving.

01:09:14.667 --> 01:09:17.042
I remember washing white clothes.

01:09:17.125 --> 01:09:19.875
Yes. By the way, your washing machine is good.

01:09:19.957 --> 01:09:22.125
Can be relied upon. Salute

01:09:22.875 --> 01:09:26.792
Jaime, you see that I can't
arrest him by force.

01:09:26.875 --> 01:09:29.957
He must come alone.
For that, I need bait.

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:33.542
- Please find the real one.
- That's not the deal.

01:09:33.625 --> 01:09:36.542
You are wrong. You don't need me.

01:09:36.625 --> 01:09:40.417
Are you protecting him now?
Do you believe the boast?

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:41.875
Of course not!

01:09:42.207 --> 01:09:44.082
However, that is true.

01:09:45.917 --> 01:09:47.375
A minute.

01:09:49.292 --> 01:09:52.000
Juan, I forgive and love you.

01:09:52.082 --> 01:09:54.292
How come? You're my only friend.

01:09:54.375 --> 01:09:57.667
Luisa is in danger now.
Ata said Muller wanted to kidnap him.

01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:59.125
Messed up. Woman on that TV.

01:09:59.708 --> 01:10:03.625
Sorry, I think they read my mind.

01:10:19.333 --> 01:10:21.375
- Do you think you can leave now?
- yes.

01:10:21.542 --> 01:10:23.417
- That's not a question.
- no.

01:10:24.917 --> 01:10:26.208
Jaime.

01:10:27.042 --> 01:10:30.167
Sorry. This hurts me more
than for you.

01:10:31.208 --> 01:10:35.167
No, actually I think this is more
painful for you, unless you help.

01:10:36.542 --> 01:10:39.292
Ata even! This is not a good way!

01:10:39.375 --> 01:10:40.375
Not like this!

01:10:41.083 --> 01:10:42.708
Is the trap ready?

01:10:44.042 --> 01:10:46.208
- almost ready.
- "Almost ready" is bad.

01:10:46.292 --> 01:10:47.875
My father arrived soon.

01:10:48.417 --> 01:10:51.792
- So, where is your girlfriend?
- He is not my girlfriend! Stop it!

01:10:51.875 --> 01:10:54.875
Just call as you like,
but he is in danger because of you!

01:10:54.958 --> 01:10:56.792
Thank you for the analysis, Mother.

01:10:56.958 --> 01:11:01.333
If you are reluctant to save your planet,
whatever. However, save him.

01:11:13.917 --> 01:11:16.583
- hello?
<i> - Luisa? Where are you? </ I></i>

01:11:17.125 --> 01:11:18.750
Juan? I can't hear you.

01:11:19.417 --> 01:11:22.208
Bad signal. Where are you?
I will pick you up.

01:11:22.292 --> 01:11:24.583
On the way home.
I can meet you there.

01:11:24.667 --> 01:11:28.375
Not! Not at your place!
Stay there, there are lots of people.

01:11:28.667 --> 01:11:30.333
I'm at Arco de Triunfo.

01:11:30.417 --> 01:11:31.417
Is it true?

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:34.417
You will not believe. Me too!
I'm coming soon.

01:11:51.917 --> 01:11:52.917
Luisa?

01:11:53.375 --> 01:11:55.333
- What happened to you?
- me? What happened to you?

01:11:56.208 --> 01:11:57.375
When do we meet?

01:11:57.667 --> 01:12:00.750
What is your favorite drink?
Do you like olives in your pizza?

01:12:00.833 --> 01:12:03.833
- Juan, you are acting weird.
- You're Luisa. No more mistake.

01:12:03.917 --> 01:12:05.417
Tell me what happened.

01:12:05.833 --> 01:12:07.458
Luisa, I'm not normal.

01:12:07.542 --> 01:12:10.208
- I know. You have several things ...
- Some things, right.

01:12:10.292 --> 01:12:13.625
Like I can melt ice
with my eyes,

01:12:13.792 --> 01:12:15.625
can see through the wall,

01:12:15.708 --> 01:12:18.292
or maybe sneezing,
then knock down the wall.

01:12:18.792 --> 01:12:20.792
Besides that, yes, I'm just normal.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.583
Well. Is it time for me to laugh?

01:12:24.250 --> 01:12:25.583
I stopped the train.

01:12:26.167 --> 01:12:28.125
I can fly too,
but just found out today.

01:12:28.917 --> 01:12:32.708
I've been given a reason when it was decided,
but this is the worst.

01:12:32.792 --> 01:12:34.875
- This is not an excuse!
- I'll tell you something.

01:12:34.958 --> 01:12:38.208
We don't even date,
you don't need to lie.

01:12:38.292 --> 01:12:39.875
I tell the truth, Luisa.

01:12:39.958 --> 01:12:42.917
Never mind Juan. That means you are an alien.

01:12:43.667 --> 01:12:44.667
What?

01:12:45.208 --> 01:12:47.750
- As I need it.
- Don't go too far.

01:12:47.833 --> 01:12:50.958
- Let's make it like this. If it's true, show it!
- No kidding.

01:12:51.042 --> 01:12:53.083
You say you can fly?
Try flying. Do it.

01:12:53.167 --> 01:12:56.875
How can I fly here?
They will find us!

01:12:56.958 --> 01:12:58.542
- Who?
- "Muller!

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.583
- He's an alien from the same planet.
- Your planet?

01:13:02.667 --> 01:13:03.917
- Chitón.
- What?

01:13:04.125 --> 01:13:07.500
If you make up the name of the planet, don't
sounds like the name of the village in Albacete!

01:13:10.375 --> 01:13:11.667
What?

01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:14.917
- You made a costume?
- My mother made it.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.125
Your mother made you a costume
to decide me?

01:13:18.583 --> 01:13:19.917
Really, Luisa. This...

01:13:21.167 --> 01:13:23.208
You made me do this ...

01:13:24.417 --> 01:13:25.500
in front of everyone!

01:13:25.583 --> 01:13:28.500
However, it's always the same as you. Always the same!

01:13:29.250 --> 01:13:30.583
You don't help at all.

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:35.625
Look at that?

01:13:36.125 --> 01:13:37.250
Arco de Triunfo?

01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:40.125
I'll jump past it
and come back again.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.917
I have never been decided
in the original way before.

01:13:54.292 --> 01:13:56.583
Hey, stupid. Where are you going?

01:13:56.667 --> 01:14:00.208
If you want to work in this place,

01:14:00.458 --> 01:14:03.375
You must get permission from Jeferson Noruega
like the others!

01:14:03.458 --> 01:14:05.250
Sorry, this is a misunderstanding.

01:14:05.667 --> 01:14:07.375
- I'm a real hero.
- lie.

01:14:08.375 --> 01:14:10.583
I know the real one, Osvaldo.

01:14:10.667 --> 01:14:12.792
He became RoboCop on Saturday
on Las Ramblas.

01:14:14.792 --> 01:14:18.042
You don't understand. This is not a costume.

01:14:18.125 --> 01:14:20.750
Yes, right. This is your sleepwear.

01:14:20.958 --> 01:14:24.458
Jef, we maintain quality only
to be destroyed by this person. Basic...

01:14:24.542 --> 01:14:26.792
Two things. One, this is not pajamas.

01:14:26.875 --> 01:14:29.375
Two, I did save people.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Luisa?

01:14:34.083 --> 01:14:34.917
Luisa?

01:14:39.417 --> 01:14:40.875
- Enter!
- Street!

01:14:43.125 --> 01:14:44.125
Luisa!

01:14:44.708 --> 01:14:47.250
- Luisa!
- Wait a minute.

01:14:47.458 --> 01:14:49.583
You can't go until you say
Where do you get it.

01:14:49.667 --> 01:14:51.750
- I don't want a problem.
- Oh, I see?

01:14:59.250 --> 01:15:01.625
<i> This is me again, son Jan. </ i></i>

01:15:01.833 --> 01:15:05.042
<i> I don't want to hurt Luisa. </ i>
<i> So, don't waste my time. </ i></i></i>

01:15:05.417 --> 01:15:07.167
- Don't be brave!
- Oh, I see?

01:15:08.833 --> 01:15:11.250
Get out of here, clown!

01:15:11.333 --> 01:15:13.375
- What do you want from me?
- Go away from here!

01:15:21.542 --> 01:15:22.708
The sword!

01:15:24.292 --> 01:15:26.667
<i> Accept, you're not like the others. </ i></i>

01:15:28.583 --> 01:15:30.208
- Goddamn it! You stupid!
- Sorry.

01:15:30.292 --> 01:15:32.708
- You ruined my costume.
- It was torn.

01:15:32.792 --> 01:15:34.000
Seriously!

01:15:35.083 --> 01:15:36.458
<i> My father will come soon. </ i></i>

01:15:36.542 --> 01:15:40.292
<i> Join and be together, we will master </ i>
<i> these sad creatures. </ i></i></i>

01:15:47.542 --> 01:15:49.583
<i> - I'm waiting for you here. </ i>
- Where are you?</i>

01:15:50.125 --> 01:15:52.875
- Where is Luisa?
<i> - You know where I am. </ i></i>

01:16:25.125 --> 01:16:27.042
Excuse me. Is this the Muller data office?

01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:56.667
- please!
- Where have you been?

01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:59.000
- Help us! Look at this!
- Get us out of here!

01:16:59.083 --> 01:17:00.625
- Use your strength!
- What happened?

01:17:00.708 --> 01:17:03.125
- Be careful, it's a trap!
- Where are you from?

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:06.250
If you talk together,
I don't understand.

01:17:06.333 --> 01:17:08.125
Don't get out of the elevator! That's a trap.

01:17:13.333 --> 01:17:15.333
- Juan, what happened?
- I told you, Luisa.

01:17:15.417 --> 01:17:16.750
He has strength. I see!

01:17:16.833 --> 01:17:19.208
Humans don't have it.

01:17:19.292 --> 01:17:21.167
Juanito, he doesn't believe. Fly away

01:17:21.250 --> 01:17:24.167
What for? We are inside.
I can hit.

01:17:24.250 --> 01:17:26.208
If so, superpower or vision.

01:17:26.292 --> 01:17:29.667
Super vision! Not super vision.
That's different again. That's the supervisor!

01:17:30.042 --> 01:17:32.708
You don't need to fix my words
in front of him.

01:17:32.792 --> 01:17:34.000
You're sad.

01:17:35.792 --> 01:17:36.917
Your panties.

01:17:38.958 --> 01:17:40.542
You wear black braids

01:17:41.125 --> 01:17:42.458
with pads.

01:17:43.167 --> 01:17:46.667
You wear underwear
different brands.

01:17:49.667 --> 01:17:51.083
Do you have a tattoo?

01:17:51.542 --> 01:17:53.208
It's sexy.

01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:54.708
The writing, "Rober"?

01:17:55.792 --> 01:17:57.542
You say, just close friends.

01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:59.583
Don't talk about Rober now!

01:18:00.083 --> 01:18:01.417
I see something too.

01:18:01.667 --> 01:18:05.083
You have a mole. There, above ...

01:18:05.167 --> 01:18:07.833
You don't see anything! Open my bond!

01:18:08.958 --> 01:18:09.792
Juan?

01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:11.667
What happened to you?

01:18:12.375 --> 01:18:13.208
Juan!

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.167
<i> - I heard a sound. </ i>
<i> - What? </ i></i></i>

01:18:15.250 --> 01:18:17.250
<i> - Sounds. </ i>
- suffering.</i>

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.000
It reads!

01:18:25.792 --> 01:18:28.792
It must be the loud speaker. Luisa, us
must help him get back strong.

01:18:29.792 --> 01:18:32.792
Juan, I forgive you. You like Luisa.
I've forgotten it.

01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:34.708
Why are you saying that now?

01:18:35.125 --> 01:18:36.375
So, you deliberately recruited me?

01:18:36.458 --> 01:18:38.750
Luisa, what are we doing
what should we do?

01:18:39.833 --> 01:18:43.000
Say if you like him. You even want to
make a tattoo of his name on your thigh.

01:18:44.667 --> 01:18:46.125
I'm serious! Say good things!

01:18:46.833 --> 01:18:48.667
Juan, like this ...

01:18:50.833 --> 01:18:51.833
You...

01:18:55.042 --> 01:18:56.042
very sweet.

01:18:58.042 --> 01:19:00.417
What is that? You almost killed him!

01:19:00.583 --> 01:19:02.583
- Say something great.
- Well.

01:19:02.667 --> 01:19:04.458
Juan, when ...

01:19:04.708 --> 01:19:09.292
when I said superhero from Spain
it's sad, I don't know it's you.

01:19:09.625 --> 01:19:11.958
Actually I still think so.

01:19:12.042 --> 01:19:14.375
Don't care about the costume.
We fix it later.

01:19:14.458 --> 01:19:17.417
So, gather your strength
and get us out of here!

01:19:19.792 --> 01:19:22.583
This doesn't work.
Usually in movies it never fails.

01:19:22.917 --> 01:19:24.125
Poor superhero!

01:19:26.208 --> 01:19:27.208
What did you say?

01:19:27.292 --> 01:19:29.417
See what happened to him
just because of the buzz.

01:19:31.833 --> 01:19:34.417
- No, say the one again.
- Poor superhero!

01:19:34.917 --> 01:19:37.625
Just look at him lying down. Suck!
You really are useless.

01:19:37.875 --> 01:19:39.333
Insult him again.

01:19:39.958 --> 01:19:42.042
Poor superhero!

01:19:44.792 --> 01:19:47.333
Succeeded. We must insult him.

01:19:47.542 --> 01:19:51.125
25 MENARA CAMERA

01:20:00.208 --> 01:20:01.625
Time to go home.

01:20:07.708 --> 01:20:08.750
- loser!
- Useless!

01:20:08.833 --> 01:20:10.125
Super hero? Of course.

01:20:10.208 --> 01:20:11.792
Super stupid!

01:20:11.875 --> 01:20:13.500
- stupid!
- Not competent!

01:20:13.833 --> 01:20:17.083
- Not on time!
- You're a failure! Fake superhero!

01:20:17.375 --> 01:20:19.458
You embarrass me. There's no value!

01:20:19.708 --> 01:20:21.958
Your English is poor, low level.

01:20:22.042 --> 01:20:25.250
And your PowerPoint is bad!

01:20:25.333 --> 01:20:27.125
Your kiss is awful!

01:20:27.208 --> 01:20:28.917
Is it true? I knew it.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.250
How can you smell correctly
if you have a mustache?

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:48.833
Father!

01:20:49.333 --> 01:20:53.000
- First of all, good morning.
- I really look forward to Father.

01:20:53.083 --> 01:20:55.292
Father can't wait to meet
with his son Jan.

01:20:56.875 --> 01:20:59.417
- I controlled it.
- We see what is true.

01:21:04.833 --> 01:21:06.375
You fool yourself!

01:21:06.458 --> 01:21:09.833
Not an ordinary fool.
Foolest in the entire galaxy!

01:21:10.125 --> 01:21:11.708
These people know a lot of planets.

01:21:11.958 --> 01:21:14.292
They will laugh at you.

01:21:14.375 --> 01:21:15.625
Do you know where Andromeda is?

01:21:15.708 --> 01:21:19.250
They will embarrass you
further than that.

01:21:57.583 --> 01:22:01.167
If you can fly, somehow
you're late for work every day.

01:22:01.958 --> 01:22:06.333
Knowing I'm a superhero, don't give it
know office people. They gossip.

01:22:06.417 --> 01:22:08.708
You're a superhero, we'll see.

01:22:08.792 --> 01:22:10.500
Do you want to let me go?

01:22:10.583 --> 01:22:12.083
- Don't! I trust you.
- OK.

01:22:12.333 --> 01:22:13.583
Where do we want to go?

01:22:13.708 --> 01:22:16.208
To the place of people
30 year olds gather.

01:22:18.708 --> 01:22:21.375
Not! Impossible!

01:22:21.542 --> 01:22:23.625
He can't escape.

01:22:24.708 --> 01:22:27.208
- Father ...
- Father wants to clear up.

01:22:27.292 --> 01:22:29.875
Not for a second, Father believed
you caught him.

01:22:30.875 --> 01:22:31.917
He was here.

01:22:33.292 --> 01:22:38.667
Daddy saw you and wanted to push the button
to destroy this garbage.

01:22:41.583 --> 01:22:43.833
You embarrass your family.

01:22:44.208 --> 01:22:48.375
At your age, your grandmother, Ursula,
has mastered the entire galaxy!

01:22:48.875 --> 01:22:51.208
Your cousin, Virguis, is still 18 years old.

01:22:51.375 --> 01:22:54.083
He has done it twice
massacre at Alpha Centauri!

01:22:54.292 --> 01:22:55.958
Look at you!

01:22:56.292 --> 01:22:58.917
How can you let the planet
stay like this?

01:22:59.208 --> 01:23:00.208
Life!

01:23:00.417 --> 01:23:02.917
So alive that I'm sick of it!

01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:06.417
Where is lava? Chaos?

01:23:06.833 --> 01:23:09.167
I want the volcano everywhere!

01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:14.750
The whole planet is under my control,
even though they are unconscious.

01:23:14.917 --> 01:23:17.083
What's the point if they aren't aware?

01:23:17.792 --> 01:23:20.167
You're like a useless pet,
as...

01:23:20.708 --> 01:23:25.083
Whoever you are, say,
but if only you weren't my daughter!

01:23:25.833 --> 01:23:28.333
Where is your spirit
to become the leader of Chitón?

01:23:28.708 --> 01:23:30.375
Where is your character?

01:23:30.667 --> 01:23:34.042
Where is the spirit to do important things?

01:23:35.417 --> 01:23:36.542
Here.

01:23:52.583 --> 01:23:53.917
Finally, father's daughter.

01:23:54.833 --> 01:23:58.125
Now, father is proud of you.

01:24:17.792 --> 01:24:18.833
Any objections?

01:24:20.625 --> 01:24:24.208
Then we move.
There is a planet that I must destroy.

01:24:28.917 --> 01:24:29.917
Are you sure?

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.583
Listen, Luisa. I might have it
Super power,

01:24:32.667 --> 01:24:34.292
but can't understand you.

01:24:34.375 --> 01:24:35.375
- me?
- Yes, you are.

01:24:35.625 --> 01:24:38.583
A few days ago,
You say the superhero is sad.

01:24:38.667 --> 01:24:39.958
Now, don't want to burn the costume.

01:24:40.042 --> 01:24:43.042
Atagata will keep looking for you,
and you have to survive.

01:24:43.125 --> 01:24:45.542
If I'm no longer a hero,
maybe he will stop.

01:24:46.708 --> 01:24:49.500
I shouldn't have stopped the train.
That's when the problem starts.

01:24:49.583 --> 01:24:52.667
Is it true? Have you ever done anything
useful before?

01:24:53.292 --> 01:24:56.583
- Burning it doesn't make you normal.
- Do you know what pisses me off?

01:24:57.083 --> 01:24:59.625
Lately, I can't be normal.

01:25:00.042 --> 01:25:02.042
If you can,
we won't fight now,

01:25:02.125 --> 01:25:04.375
argue about dinner places,

01:25:04.458 --> 01:25:07.417
or when to meet again,
which of course I still want.

01:25:09.583 --> 01:25:13.125
You can't choose to be
like everyone else because you are different.

01:25:15.833 --> 01:25:17.917
I can choose. See.

01:25:24.583 --> 01:25:28.083
- Tell them later it will be sticky.
- Give them time. I know Juan.

01:25:28.167 --> 01:25:31.292
You parents,
but I'm the boss and his friend.

01:25:31.667 --> 01:25:34.500
And you are not his biological parents,
so, listen to me.

01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:39.458
Someone is coming!
Tell Juanito to hide!

01:25:39.542 --> 01:25:42.542
- What are you doing, Juan?
- This criminal will know who his father is.

01:25:42.708 --> 01:25:44.750
When I found the bullet,
I'll show them.

01:25:44.917 --> 01:25:46.500
What happened?

01:25:47.792 --> 01:25:48.792
Right here.

01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:58.708
- Not burning.
- No, it only takes time.

01:25:58.792 --> 01:26:00.000
Of course it will burn.

01:26:00.083 --> 01:26:02.125
This is not the strangest thing
we've ever seen.

01:26:02.208 --> 01:26:04.708
All now
what happened here must be strange!

01:26:04.875 --> 01:26:06.542
Don't be paranoid.

01:26:07.083 --> 01:26:09.583
Juanito! Juanito, look!

01:26:09.792 --> 01:26:12.083
Aliens have arrived!

01:26:27.458 --> 01:26:29.875
He did not stop looking for problems.

01:26:30.208 --> 01:26:31.708
Why is the costume there?

01:26:31.792 --> 01:26:33.417
I don't want to wear it again, Mother!

01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:37.000
Why? Looks good.
Mother sewed it nicely.

01:26:37.833 --> 01:26:39.500
Why are you so annoying?

01:26:39.583 --> 01:26:42.708
Where do you want to go
until you have to ride a flying saucer?

01:26:42.792 --> 01:26:44.583
You must be very stupid.

01:26:44.833 --> 01:26:46.083
I don't want any problems!

01:26:46.750 --> 01:26:48.625
First of all, good morning.

01:26:48.708 --> 01:26:50.917
I don't want to go to your planet!
You can't persuade me!

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.625
I don't have to persuade you.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.833
I will destroy your planet,
starting from your family.

01:26:55.917 --> 01:26:58.875
What do you want to do with it?
A giant toaster?

01:26:59.292 --> 01:27:00.708
Have you ever seen yourself?

01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:28.792
The costume!

01:27:29.167 --> 01:27:30.958
- The costume!
- The costume!

01:27:33.042 --> 01:27:34.250
- fast.
- Use twigs!

01:27:37.708 --> 01:27:38.833
- Watch Out!
- Here, Juan!

01:27:38.917 --> 01:27:39.958
- Come on!
- Come here.

01:27:40.042 --> 01:27:42.167
- Say you're not scared!
- I'm not afraid!

01:27:42.250 --> 01:27:43.750
Even you don't believe that.

01:27:43.833 --> 01:27:46.000
If he says don't be afraid,
I said no fear.

01:27:46.083 --> 01:27:48.375
But, of course I'm afraid.
See the magnitude!

01:27:48.458 --> 01:27:50.375
Two days wearing the same underwear!

01:27:50.625 --> 01:27:51.708
He keeps getting bigger!

01:27:53.208 --> 01:27:54.042
Come on

01:27:55.042 --> 01:27:56.542
- hot!
- No problem.

01:27:56.625 --> 01:27:59.083
Put your feet here. Come here!

01:28:04.167 --> 01:28:07.167
If my mom helps me use this,
I have no authority.

01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:08.958
He almost came, Juan!

01:28:15.167 --> 01:28:16.833
Go! Leave me with him!

01:28:16.917 --> 01:28:18.708
- How can we leave?
- Go away!

01:28:19.083 --> 01:28:20.958
Fast!

01:28:31.833 --> 01:28:32.917
What?

01:28:33.292 --> 01:28:34.875
Whatever you say, he is my child!

01:28:38.667 --> 01:28:40.292
For the sake of a large spoon!

01:28:41.417 --> 01:28:42.875
Don't disturb my family!

01:28:43.167 --> 01:28:44.542
This is between you and me!

01:28:44.625 --> 01:28:45.625
Family...

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.583
The family is too important.

01:28:57.667 --> 01:28:59.000
My gun!

01:29:03.708 --> 01:29:05.917
- Hang in there, Daddy!
- You can't, son!

01:29:06.083 --> 01:29:07.458
It seems father isn't strong anymore!

01:29:07.542 --> 01:29:09.708
Hang on, Juan! Hold on!

01:29:14.333 --> 01:29:15.417
Forgive me.

01:29:15.917 --> 01:29:18.917
- I think it's time for me to stand out!
- Of course!

01:29:19.292 --> 01:29:21.875
Show the world the ability
the López family!

01:29:25.542 --> 01:29:26.375
Father!

01:29:29.625 --> 01:29:32.542
Calm down, everything is in control!

01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:35.792
He sucked!

01:29:50.458 --> 01:29:53.208
- Isn't that the loser?
- Shut up.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.042
This will enter YouTube.
Transformer against the Feminine.

01:30:09.792 --> 01:30:12.333
He will kill him!

01:30:14.167 --> 01:30:15.917
Juanito!

01:30:19.667 --> 01:30:20.667
He came.

01:30:26.167 --> 01:30:28.625
<i> Look out. Danger. The ball is on the right side. </ I></i>

01:30:28.708 --> 01:30:30.250
<i> The ball reaches Leo Messi. Leo ... </ i></i>

01:30:30.333 --> 01:30:32.375
<i> However, look, someone entered the field. </ i></i>

01:30:32.458 --> 01:30:33.333
Who is that?

01:30:33.417 --> 01:30:37.292
<i> Someone entered the field. </ i>
<i> Not a player, but an intruder. </ i></i></i>

01:30:37.583 --> 01:30:40.208
Damn intruders!

01:30:40.292 --> 01:30:42.292
He isn't even naked!

01:30:43.083 --> 01:30:48.250
<i> He approached the referee and asked for a penalty. </ i>
<i> Unbelievable. </ i></i></i>

01:30:48.333 --> 01:30:50.250
<i> What did this person do? Take him out! </ I></i>

01:30:50.333 --> 01:30:54.292
Chase him away, referee!
He messed up this final match.

01:30:55.417 --> 01:30:57.583
<i> Amazing. Look at the players' faces. </ I></i>

01:30:57.667 --> 01:30:59.958
<i> He pulled a net. </ i>
<i> Someone has to get rid of this person! </ i></i></i>

01:31:10.083 --> 01:31:11.375
Everyone, look.

01:31:35.792 --> 01:31:38.167
- What are you doing here?
- Do not ask.

01:31:41.583 --> 01:31:44.750
- What did you do to my parents?
- I told you they were not your parents.

01:31:55.042 --> 01:31:56.083
Not!

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Jaime.

01:32:05.833 --> 01:32:09.292
- Jamie, help me. Turn your attention.
- Sorry, the robot?

01:32:09.375 --> 01:32:11.500
- You are crazy.
- He will destroy it!

01:32:11.583 --> 01:32:13.583
- However, we can't do anything.
- Certainly can!

01:32:13.667 --> 01:32:16.333
- Turn your attention!
- wait.

01:32:16.917 --> 01:32:18.208
I have a good plan.

01:32:18.417 --> 01:32:21.708
You and I go to the basement
and stayed there for a few days.

01:32:21.792 --> 01:32:24.500
What? Are you trying to seduce me, Jaime?

01:32:24.958 --> 01:32:27.042
However, subtly.

01:32:29.667 --> 01:32:31.625
Shit!

01:32:32.208 --> 01:32:34.500
This is the famous finishing weapon.

01:32:34.750 --> 01:32:38.750
I want to continue playing,
but there is a planet that I must destroy.

01:32:46.333 --> 01:32:47.542
Hey, bro!

01:32:48.167 --> 01:32:50.833
Read my mind!

01:32:50.958 --> 01:32:54.167
I think you should follow me!

01:33:00.875 --> 01:33:02.542
- Hold something!
- It's too soft here.

01:33:02.625 --> 01:33:04.042
- go up!
- You can't, Juan.

01:33:04.125 --> 01:33:05.125
Go up!

01:33:08.333 --> 01:33:09.708
I almost tricked him.

01:33:09.958 --> 01:33:13.292
- What?
- Juan, useless basis! Rubbish!

01:33:13.708 --> 01:33:16.375
Insult my son again, and you will perish!

01:33:16.958 --> 01:33:19.417
I know this sounds weird,
but this works.

01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:22.833
Juan, you're ugly! Very ugly!

01:33:23.250 --> 01:33:25.958
We must work together,
otherwise the planet is destroyed!

01:33:34.625 --> 01:33:35.458
Juan!

01:33:36.125 --> 01:33:37.333
Juan!

01:33:38.708 --> 01:33:40.083
Juan, wake up!

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:50.042
Juanito, adopted child is not loved
like a biological child!

01:33:50.125 --> 01:33:52.042
You were defeated by a girl!

01:33:52.125 --> 01:33:53.667
Get up, Juan!

01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:57.500
Please! Get up!

01:34:02.458 --> 01:34:03.625
Juan, I'm here!

01:34:38.667 --> 01:34:41.208
Well. We finish this.

01:34:41.542 --> 01:34:42.625
Agree!

01:35:01.542 --> 01:35:03.083
Like on our first date, Juan!

01:35:05.125 --> 01:35:07.333
Destroy him at once!

01:35:13.792 --> 01:35:14.833
My mom!

01:35:16.292 --> 01:35:20.333
Luisa poked my ass first!
Your mother is now doing it!

01:35:47.083 --> 01:35:48.958
I can destroy you at once!

01:35:49.042 --> 01:35:51.083
Don't act a lot, López.
That is not your expertise.

01:35:51.792 --> 01:35:53.708
My name is Superlópez.

01:36:23.333 --> 01:36:24.833
Did he say Superlópez?

01:36:25.292 --> 01:36:26.833
I prefer the Feminine.

01:36:29.583 --> 01:36:30.458
Please!

01:36:30.542 --> 01:36:32.458
Juan, are you okay?

01:36:32.708 --> 01:36:34.125
Get me out of here!

01:36:36.875 --> 01:36:38.208
- Are you okay?
- Not.

01:36:38.292 --> 01:36:39.625
- It is enough.
- Very bad.

01:36:39.917 --> 01:36:42.417
You're welcome, Juanito.
This is the second time I have saved you.

01:36:42.792 --> 01:36:43.708
- kid.
- kid.

01:36:43.792 --> 01:36:45.000
Father almost killed!

01:36:46.875 --> 01:36:50.542
- Son, your father almost drowned.
- It was very chaotic.

01:36:50.625 --> 01:36:52.500
It is okay.

01:36:52.583 --> 01:36:54.250
You make me without a hat.

01:37:03.083 --> 01:37:06.083
You see what I do, right?

01:37:06.708 --> 01:37:08.500
Maybe you are a bit like a superhero.

01:37:09.625 --> 01:37:10.875
Maybe.

01:37:11.583 --> 01:37:12.792
What are we doing now?

01:37:14.042 --> 01:37:15.708
Land and pose.

01:37:15.792 --> 01:37:18.167
It was accidental.

01:37:18.833 --> 01:37:22.708
- I don't know if you will get used to it.
- Are there other options?

01:37:23.208 --> 01:37:25.500
Just imagining it makes you sick.

01:37:25.583 --> 01:37:29.667
However, your biological parents are in Chitón
are waiting for you to save them.

01:37:30.208 --> 01:37:31.208
Don't worry, Mother.

01:37:33.125 --> 01:37:34.667
Everything is under control.

01:37:50.833 --> 01:37:53.000
<i> Son, it's been a long time. </ i></i>

01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:54.917
Thank you, son.

01:37:55.792 --> 01:37:58.750
Chitón can finally become
free planet.

01:37:59.208 --> 01:38:02.125
Son, we miss you so much.

01:38:02.708 --> 01:38:04.375
We are sure you will come back!

01:38:13.750 --> 01:38:16.125
Here, son. Kiss mom.

01:38:26.333 --> 01:38:28.292
PLANET: CHITON
LEADER: ADMIRAL SCORE

01:38:28.375 --> 01:38:31.042
LEADER: NORTHEGE JEFERSON

01:39:37.250 --> 01:39:41.750
<i> Good morning. This morning we wake up. </ I>
<i> with the appearance of a superhero. </ i></i></i>

01:39:41.833 --> 01:39:44.000
<i> The image has been seen. </ i></i>

01:39:44.083 --> 01:39:46.667
<i> City council raises taxes </ i></i>

01:39:46.750 --> 01:39:49.167
<i> to pay for damage in the city, </ i></i>

01:39:49.250 --> 01:39:51.750
<i> and we have to add headaches </ i>
<i> because of this. </ i></i></i>

01:39:51.833 --> 01:39:56.250
<i> Of course, there is a traffic jam on Line 1 </ i>
<i> because of an accident, </ i></i></i>

01:39:56.417 --> 01:40:00.792
<i> also protests from ball fans </ i>
<i> because of the delay in the final match. </ i></i></i>

01:40:00.875 --> 01:40:04.083
<i> Many voice messages on our phone. </ i></i>

01:40:04.750 --> 01:40:09.125
<i> This country, Spain, </ i>
<i> once had a real hero </ i></i></i>

01:40:09.208 --> 01:40:10.583
<i> like Don Pelayo, </ i></i>

01:40:10.667 --> 01:40:11.958
<i> and El Cid. </ i></i>

01:40:12.042 --> 01:40:15.208
<i> We don't need people who fly </ i>
<i> wandering around with underwear. </ i></i></i>

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.583
<i> I think this hero is only a diversion </ i></i>

01:40:19.667 --> 01:40:22.083
<i> so we don't discuss things </ i>
<i> that really matters. </ i></i></i>

01:40:22.750 --> 01:40:26.292
<i> I am 86 years old, a widow for 40 years. </ i></i>

01:40:26.375 --> 01:40:31.292
<i> I have imagined flirting </ i>
<i> with all alphabetical heroes. </ i></i></i>

01:40:31.375 --> 01:40:35.875
<i> Can you imagine a hero </ i>
<i> from Spain doesn't make me aroused? </ i></i></i>

01:40:35.958 --> 01:40:39.292
<i> He is so thin and ugly </ i></i>

01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:43.792
<i> with a silly name ... What's the name? </ i></i>

01:41:04.250 --> 01:41:06.792
- Don't start.
- You always do this to me, Juan!

01:41:06.875 --> 01:41:08.125
What do you want me to do?

01:41:08.208 --> 01:41:12.125
I saw a puff of smoke and my body
said, "Save people."

01:41:12.208 --> 01:41:13.292
Now, the reason is fire.

01:41:13.375 --> 01:41:16.000
If it's not a fire,
there is a robbery, or a boat.

01:41:16.375 --> 01:41:18.042
Luisa, it's a sinking cruise ship.

01:41:18.125 --> 01:41:21.458
Sorry, whatever. Now smoke!
There are firemen for that!

01:41:21.542 --> 01:41:24.667
When you see someone in danger,

01:41:24.750 --> 01:41:26.292
I saved them.

01:41:26.375 --> 01:41:28.292
If not, I think that's a bad thing.

01:41:28.375 --> 01:41:31.458
What should I do for you
arrive on time? Burn the restaurant?

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.750
I was late twice. Fifteen minutes
for the sake of the planet, this is what I got.

01:41:34.833 --> 01:41:36.167
Listen, Juan. I'll tell you.

01:41:36.250 --> 01:41:40.417
From now on, you have to combine
your life as a hero and lover.

01:41:40.875 --> 01:41:46.125
OK. If there is a disaster
and I don't act, it's your fault!

01:41:48.583 --> 01:41:49.833
- Well.
- Well.

01:41:51.708 --> 01:41:52.708
Ask for a bill.

01:41:57.708 --> 01:41:59.833
Excuse me, ask for the bill.

01:41:59.917 --> 01:42:01.583
The person there already paid for it.

01:42:13.542 --> 01:42:16.250
You owe me ... Superlópez.

01:47:22.167 --> 01:47:24.167
