00:04.005 --> 00:04.586
(waves crashing)

00:04.630 --> 00:06.922
(mysterious music)

01:04.440 --> 01:06.356
- [Man] Hey, don't go to far.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.693
- [Woman] Let's be
back here in an hour.

01:09.737 --> 01:10.319
- [Man] Okay, sounds good.

01:16.327 --> 01:19.661
(camera shutter clicks)

01:23.751 --> 01:27.044
(camera shutter clicks)

01:30.883 --> 01:34.134
(camera shutter clicks)

01:39.100 --> 01:42.184
(camera shutter clicks)

01:57.201 --> 01:59.785
(camera shutter clicks)

02:07.419 --> 02:11.046
(waves breaking)

02:26.105 --> 02:29.481
(camera shutter clicks)

02:29.525 --> 02:30.732
- Boo.
(Tara gasps)

02:30.776 --> 02:34.069
(Tara panting)

02:34.113 --> 02:35.571
- What are you doing here?

02:35.614 --> 02:37.656
- Oh, the beach.

02:37.700 --> 02:38.407
The coast.

02:38.450 --> 02:40.951
Wow, the ocean!

02:40.995 --> 02:42.244
No one's ever
photographed that before.

02:44.874 --> 02:47.916
That camera is a waste
of all your savings.

02:49.003 --> 02:51.128
You're never gonna get in.

02:51.172 --> 02:51.461
Mom and dad know it too.

02:53.799 --> 02:55.174
They're just too
weak to tell you

02:55.217 --> 02:56.508
that you have no talent,

02:56.552 --> 02:59.887
that they wish you
weren't their problems.

02:59.930 --> 03:01.013
- Please just leave me alone.
- Give me this.

03:01.056 --> 03:03.307
(Tara gasps)

03:07.229 --> 03:07.352
- You're such an idiot.

03:08.314 --> 03:09.271
Go on like that.

03:10.357 --> 03:11.315
How stupid!

03:23.329 --> 03:26.872
(ominous music)

03:37.885 --> 03:38.800
- John.

03:53.025 --> 03:53.857
John.

04:04.286 --> 04:05.494
(Tara gasps)

04:05.537 --> 04:07.412
(lady screams)

04:07.456 --> 04:10.791
(tense music)

04:15.214 --> 04:17.422
- Didn't see that one coming.

04:29.478 --> 04:31.270
(cellphone ringing)

04:31.313 --> 04:33.522
(Tara gasps)

04:34.733 --> 04:38.902
I told you already,
I am not coming you.

04:38.946 --> 04:39.945
You what?

04:43.575 --> 04:44.366
- Hi.

04:46.912 --> 04:50.580
- Amy, I am not going
with you tonight.

04:50.624 --> 04:51.999
- I know.

04:52.042 --> 04:54.334
- I have to finish my vlog.

04:54.378 --> 04:55.419
David extended my
shift tomorrow.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.379
- Okay, first off,

04:57.423 --> 04:59.172
you have got to stop letting

05:00.301 --> 05:05.012
that skeezy, wanna-be
boss walk all over you.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.596
- He's my actual boss.

05:06.724 --> 05:10.225
- Second, you have like 20
subscribers to your vlog.

05:10.269 --> 05:12.352
I'm sure they'll get over
it if it's delayed a day.

05:12.396 --> 05:14.187
- Mm.

05:15.441 --> 05:18.567
- (titters) Come on,
you're being so sensitive.

05:18.610 --> 05:19.860
- Have a drink, it'll
make you feel better.

05:19.903 --> 05:20.652
- I'm not going, Amy.

05:20.696 --> 05:22.738
- It'll be fun, I promise.

05:24.033 --> 05:25.032
- Why don't you invite Lindsey?

05:25.075 --> 05:26.575
- Because Lindsey is a mess,

05:26.702 --> 05:28.660
and I wanna have a good
time, not play babysitter.

05:28.704 --> 05:32.039
Besides if you go with me,

05:32.082 --> 05:33.665
it'll make Derek jealous.

05:35.294 --> 05:37.919
- Why would I wanna make
my boyfriend jealous?

05:37.963 --> 05:40.464
- Oh, Tara, Tara, Tara.

05:40.507 --> 05:43.175
You have so much to learn
about the ways of men.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.469
(glasses clink)

05:45.512 --> 05:47.971
- Okay.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.222
- Rude!

05:49.266 --> 05:51.141
You are so stubborn!

05:51.185 --> 05:52.184
- Me?

05:52.227 --> 05:55.103
- Just like make an appearance.

05:55.147 --> 05:58.607
You can bring your camera,
take photos of rich kids

05:58.650 --> 06:01.234
making bad choices in
their natural habitat.

06:01.278 --> 06:02.986
- Mm, that sounds appealing.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.738
- Honestly, they would
probably pay you big bucks

06:04.782 --> 06:07.574
for some profesh insta photos.

06:07.618 --> 06:08.909
Gotta make your money somehow,

06:08.952 --> 06:11.119
those gourmet meals
don't grow on trees.

06:11.163 --> 06:15.082
- I am trying to make money
by working on my vlog.

06:15.125 --> 06:18.043
- Okay, I will pay
you however much

06:18.087 --> 06:20.837
you're gonna make from these
reviews if you come with me.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.131
- (scoffs) I'm not
your charity case, Amy.

06:23.175 --> 06:26.218
- Oh my god, why would you
think that I think that?

06:26.261 --> 06:29.304
I just wanna have a fun
time with my best gal.

06:29.348 --> 06:31.515
And if I can help you
out a little bit, great!

06:33.644 --> 06:35.143
(glasses clink)
There we go.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.606
(Tara gasps)

06:39.650 --> 06:41.650
You're welcome.

06:41.819 --> 06:42.818
I made it from scratch.

06:42.861 --> 06:45.070
- You're the worst.
- I know.

06:45.114 --> 06:46.238
- Mm-hmm.

06:46.281 --> 06:48.115
- I promise I'll have
you home by midnight.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.076
I will have you
home by 11:00 PM.

06:53.122 --> 06:55.497
You will be back
inside by 10:00 PM.

06:55.541 --> 06:58.500
That is plenty of time
to do your little video.

06:58.544 --> 06:59.334
- 10:00 PM?

07:00.921 --> 07:01.920
- I promise.

07:04.258 --> 07:05.590
Ah!

07:05.634 --> 07:06.633
Yes!

07:06.677 --> 07:08.135
Okay, throw that food out.

07:08.178 --> 07:09.386
Okay, you can call it that.

07:09.430 --> 07:11.012
Put this purse on,
finish your drink.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.681
- [Tara] I'm working on it.

07:12.724 --> 07:14.224
- [Amy] Okay, let's
go, let's go, let's go.

07:17.062 --> 07:18.520
(calm music)

07:25.154 --> 07:27.112
(Amy giggles)

07:27.156 --> 07:27.612
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.331
- It's this way.
- What?

07:38.375 --> 07:39.458
- This way.

07:39.501 --> 07:42.961
(Amy giggles)
You got it.

07:43.005 --> 07:45.464
(Amy groans)

07:45.507 --> 07:46.840
- Where's my phone.

07:46.884 --> 07:48.717
- You don't need it right now.

07:48.760 --> 07:49.634
- I need to call a car.

07:49.678 --> 07:51.178
- Yep, you can just crash here.

07:51.221 --> 07:52.929
Call a car in the morning.

08:11.116 --> 08:12.365
Hey guys, Tara here.

08:12.409 --> 08:13.825
Today I'm gonna be
reviewing the 85 millimeter

08:13.869 --> 08:15.285
that just came out this week.

08:15.329 --> 08:15.911
I did a test shoot on
it the other day and.

08:15.954 --> 08:17.579
(glass clattering)

08:17.623 --> 08:18.872
Mother!

08:18.916 --> 08:21.416
(Tara sighs)

08:24.546 --> 08:27.130
(poignant music)

08:30.802 --> 08:34.221
(camera beeps)

08:37.726 --> 08:40.310
(Tara sighs)

09:05.170 --> 09:07.837
(sighs) What are
you doing Tara?!

09:12.803 --> 09:16.471
(birds chirping)

09:20.269 --> 09:23.019
- [Voicemail Assistant]
You have two new messages.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.896
First message.

09:24.940 --> 09:27.857
- [Mom On Voicemail] Hi
honey, it's mom again.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.985
You know, it's your
father's birthday today,

09:30.028 --> 09:31.945
and I just think it would
be nice to hear from you.

09:31.989 --> 09:34.573
- [Voicemail Assistant]
Message deleted.

09:34.616 --> 09:35.907
Next message.

09:37.995 --> 09:40.662
- [Derek On Voicemail] Hey, I
know you're at work right now

09:40.706 --> 09:42.622
and there's no need
to call me back.

09:42.666 --> 09:42.706
I...

09:45.877 --> 09:48.545
Well, I guess I'm
just gonna say it.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.463
I feel like maybe we
should take a break.

09:51.383 --> 09:52.465
The big show is coming up,

09:52.509 --> 09:55.051
and I just really
need to focus on that.

09:56.972 --> 09:58.555
You've always been my
biggest cheerleader

09:58.599 --> 10:02.475
and I appreciate all that,
but I just think that...

10:04.271 --> 10:07.147
I don't think I can be
the same to you right now.

10:07.190 --> 10:09.482
You know, I'm under a lot
of pressure with everything

10:09.526 --> 10:10.984
and I just think
it's for the best.

10:11.028 --> 10:13.528
So yeah...

10:15.991 --> 10:18.450
Well, I hope we can
still be friends,

10:18.493 --> 10:20.910
and if you wanna still come
to the show and take pictures,

10:20.954 --> 10:21.870
that would be awesome.

10:21.913 --> 10:24.331
But I understand if not.

10:26.001 --> 10:26.791
Anyway...

10:28.211 --> 10:29.961
Or maybe I'll see you there.

10:32.090 --> 10:33.840
- [Voicemail Assistant]
End of message.

10:33.884 --> 10:35.717
To delete this message press.

10:35.761 --> 10:38.094
(phone beeps)

10:52.569 --> 10:55.570
(phone ringtone sounding)

10:55.614 --> 10:56.363
- [Derek On Voicemail]
This is Derek.

10:56.406 --> 10:57.155
Leave a message.

11:02.996 --> 11:06.456
(Tara exhales)

11:07.000 --> 11:11.920
(phone ringtone sounding)

11:12.464 --> 11:13.755
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.803
(Tara sobbing)

11:23.433 --> 11:25.767
- Forget him.

11:25.811 --> 11:27.435
You're too good for him.

11:27.479 --> 11:28.395
- Am I?

11:28.438 --> 11:29.521
- He's a wannabe rockstar

11:29.564 --> 11:32.607
that still thinks he
can make it at 35.

11:32.651 --> 11:34.818
Trust me when I say
you can do better.

11:36.196 --> 11:39.239
- I just don't know what
I'm doing anymore, Amy.

11:41.743 --> 11:41.908
I hate my job.

11:43.036 --> 11:46.705
I've no time for my
non-existent career.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.792
My parents don't talk
to me, and my boyfriend,

11:50.836 --> 11:52.752
who apparently was a
total loser anyway,

11:52.796 --> 11:53.503
just dumped me.

11:53.547 --> 11:56.256
- That's what I'm saying.

11:56.299 --> 11:57.757
You're stuck.

11:57.801 --> 11:59.801
You're dead in the water,

11:59.845 --> 12:02.470
but this is your chance
to change all of that.

12:02.723 --> 12:05.181
Nobody wants to be
a waitress forever.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.433
You're almost 30,
can you imagine

12:06.476 --> 12:09.018
if you were still slinging
French fries then?

12:10.230 --> 12:11.354
- I'm not you, Amy.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.231
I don't have any savings.

12:13.275 --> 12:15.900
I'm living on credit cards.

12:15.944 --> 12:18.862
- I'm talking about getting
creative with your talents.

12:21.742 --> 12:22.615
- No.

12:23.702 --> 12:25.660
You're not gonna drag
me out to any more clubs

12:25.704 --> 12:28.163
where I take photos of
your other spoiled friends.

12:29.291 --> 12:30.081
- Okay.

12:31.334 --> 12:32.542
I know you're having a bad day,

12:32.586 --> 12:34.252
so I'm gonna pretend
like I didn't hear that.

12:34.296 --> 12:37.380
- Well, I didn't mean--
- No, no, no, it's okay.

12:38.592 --> 12:39.174
Listen.

12:39.217 --> 12:41.718
I have an idea.

12:41.762 --> 12:45.180
My parents have
this amazing house

12:45.223 --> 12:47.432
that I used to go to
every summer as a kid.

12:47.476 --> 12:49.392
It's on it's own private lake.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.477
It's surrounded by forest.

12:50.520 --> 12:51.895
Great for hiking,
totally secluded.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.314
It's just like,

12:54.357 --> 12:56.858
honestly, it's really amazing.

12:56.902 --> 12:58.193
- Okay.

12:58.236 --> 13:01.237
- Well, my mom mentioned
that they're selling it

13:01.281 --> 13:04.866
and so we should totally
go while we still can.

13:04.910 --> 13:07.076
You can bring your
camera and take photos.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.078
I bet my parents would
pay you for that.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.372
And honestly, the
place is so beautiful

13:11.416 --> 13:12.957
that you're gonna
wanna do that anyway.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.083
(Tara sighs)

13:14.127 --> 13:15.001
Don't give me that.

13:15.045 --> 13:17.170
This is not some charity case

13:17.214 --> 13:20.590
or whatever hateful
thing you said.

13:20.675 --> 13:22.884
I just think it'd be
a great opportunity

13:22.928 --> 13:25.011
to kill two birds
with one stone.

13:25.055 --> 13:27.514
- And what birds would those be?

13:27.557 --> 13:30.767
- Well, in addition to
a possible paycheck,

13:30.811 --> 13:33.061
we could have a girls' weekend!

13:33.104 --> 13:36.481
No work, no douchy Derek,

13:36.525 --> 13:40.777
just a beautiful
lake and great views.

13:40.862 --> 13:42.946
Let's do it, let's
go this weekend.

13:42.989 --> 13:45.323
- I'm not big on lakes.

13:45.367 --> 13:45.990
- Who's not big on lakes?

13:48.286 --> 13:50.161
Is this about your brother?

13:50.205 --> 13:52.163
- Why would you say that?

13:53.708 --> 13:56.960
- Tara, I know you
better than anybody else.

13:57.003 --> 14:01.089
And you're never gonna
be able to move forward

14:01.132 --> 14:03.132
until you let go of your past.

14:05.011 --> 14:05.510
It was an accident.

14:05.554 --> 14:06.302
It was a...

14:07.681 --> 14:11.182
A horrible accident,
but an accident.

14:12.978 --> 14:14.269
- It's not that.
- Then what?

14:19.609 --> 14:21.484
- Derek chose this weekend.

14:23.113 --> 14:25.113
- Tara, you can't go to that.
- What?

14:25.156 --> 14:28.032
- (sighs) I think
he wants me to go.

14:30.287 --> 14:30.994
Look, I know he wants me to go.

14:33.498 --> 14:34.080
If I could just talk to him--

14:34.124 --> 14:36.666
- And say what?

14:36.710 --> 14:38.501
Hey, congrats on the show.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.212
I'll be in the back taking
photos of your band for free.

14:41.256 --> 14:43.798
Oh, and by the way, I'm
still totally available

14:43.842 --> 14:45.800
for any emotional abuse
you'd like to fling

14:45.844 --> 14:47.427
in my general direction.

14:47.470 --> 14:49.679
This does not have
a happy ending.

14:49.723 --> 14:50.972
Trust me.

14:51.016 --> 14:53.099
He just wants you
there for the photos.

14:53.143 --> 14:55.018
And I'm saying this
because I love you

14:55.061 --> 14:57.020
and you're my friend.

14:59.941 --> 15:01.983
- I just feel like...

15:03.987 --> 15:04.986
Like I need to be there.

15:06.364 --> 15:06.988
- Okay.

15:07.032 --> 15:08.948
How about this?

15:10.243 --> 15:13.077
We go for a day, for 24
hours, see how it goes.

15:13.121 --> 15:14.078
If you still feel like
you need to go to the show

15:14.122 --> 15:15.246
then, okay, fine,

15:15.290 --> 15:18.082
we'll just leave first
thing in the morning,

15:18.126 --> 15:19.500
and we can make it in time.

15:21.004 --> 15:23.087
But if you have fun, we
can stay the weekend.

15:23.131 --> 15:25.298
And you can bring your work.

15:25.342 --> 15:28.509
I mean, it would be a gorgeous
backdrop for those vlogs.

15:28.553 --> 15:29.135
And I know my parents
are gonna wanna pay you

15:29.179 --> 15:31.137
for those photos.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.223
It'll be great.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.600
It'll be a killer weekend.

15:36.728 --> 15:37.477
What do you say?

15:38.396 --> 15:39.187
Deal?

15:47.447 --> 15:50.031
(mysterious music)

15:50.075 --> 15:53.701
(birds chirping)

16:01.294 --> 16:02.585
- [Tara Voiceover]
Hey guys, Tara here.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.295
Thought I would put these
new lenses to the test

16:04.339 --> 16:07.131
by going on a little nature
getaway to my friend's lake.

16:07.175 --> 16:09.717
I know, I was surprised when
I heard they had a lake too.

16:09.761 --> 16:12.303
And get this, it's
named after them.

16:12.347 --> 16:14.138
Anyway, I'll be posting
updates once we're there,

16:14.182 --> 16:16.557
so make sure you check back.

16:19.396 --> 16:20.603
- [Tara] You weren't kidding,

16:20.647 --> 16:22.897
this really is the
middle of nowhere.

16:22.941 --> 16:24.774
- [Amy] Does your car
always make that sound?

16:26.987 --> 16:28.778
(car rattling)

16:28.822 --> 16:31.280
- [Tara] This is the
little lake house?

16:31.324 --> 16:32.198
- [Amy] This is it.

16:45.088 --> 16:47.672
(car hissing)

16:55.223 --> 16:56.806
- Is it okay?

16:56.850 --> 16:57.682
- Yeah, this happens.

16:57.726 --> 16:59.308
It's probably just overheated.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.102
I think I'll take a look at
it when it's cooled down.

17:01.146 --> 17:02.145
- Okay.

17:02.230 --> 17:02.270
So...

17:05.900 --> 17:06.899
What do you think?

17:06.943 --> 17:08.985
- I think when you
said lake house

17:09.029 --> 17:10.236
I wasn't expecting this.
(Amy giggles)

17:10.280 --> 17:13.740
Also, why has it taken
us this long to visit?

17:13.783 --> 17:15.116
- I may have forgotten
that we owned it

17:15.160 --> 17:17.326
until my mum mentioned
we were selling it.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.120
Wait till you see
the view of the lake.

17:22.876 --> 17:25.418
(Amy sighs)

17:32.802 --> 17:35.178
- (exhales) Wow.

17:35.221 --> 17:35.261
- Right?

17:37.223 --> 17:37.680
(Amy exhales)

17:37.724 --> 17:40.475
(calm music)

17:46.608 --> 17:48.191
I remember it being bigger.

17:52.822 --> 17:53.529
- [Tara Voiceover] John!

17:58.203 --> 17:58.868
- Are you okay?

17:58.912 --> 18:00.036
- Yeah.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.497
I didn't realize we'd
be right on the coast.

18:02.540 --> 18:03.498
- We're not.

18:03.541 --> 18:04.290
There's a whole lake in between.

18:05.210 --> 18:09.378
(Amy titters)

18:09.422 --> 18:11.756
- When's the last
time someone was here?

18:11.800 --> 18:13.299
- Who knows!

18:13.343 --> 18:15.093
My parents rent it out
every now and again,

18:15.136 --> 18:18.471
but honestly I think it just
sits empty most of the time.

18:18.515 --> 18:20.264
- You'd think they'd wanna
be here all the time?

18:20.308 --> 18:22.475
- Oh, you haven't seen
their actual house.

18:22.519 --> 18:24.435
This is a dump compared to that.

18:24.479 --> 18:26.687
- Does this thing work?

18:26.731 --> 18:28.815
- Probably not, this
place is a catch all

18:28.858 --> 18:31.275
for decades of
strange collectibles.

18:33.488 --> 18:36.280
(Amy sighs)

18:36.324 --> 18:38.324
- No service.
- Right?

18:39.410 --> 18:40.493
It'll be good.

18:40.537 --> 18:41.410
No temptation.

18:42.455 --> 18:43.788
- Is there wifi at least?

18:45.542 --> 18:47.041
- I think so.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.042
- Amy!
- What?

18:48.086 --> 18:49.252
- How am I supposed
to do my vlog?

18:49.295 --> 18:51.629
- Ah, stop whining
about your vlog!

18:51.673 --> 18:54.423
Just record your videos here

18:54.467 --> 18:56.175
and upload them
when you get back.

18:56.219 --> 18:59.220
Could I get a thank you, Amy?

18:59.264 --> 19:00.638
I'm doing this for you.

19:03.685 --> 19:04.725
- You're right.

19:04.769 --> 19:05.309
I'm sorry.

19:05.353 --> 19:07.854
Thank you.

19:08.148 --> 19:10.314
This is really something.

19:12.402 --> 19:14.110
- You're welcome.

19:14.154 --> 19:14.277
Let's go see your room.

19:19.951 --> 19:21.951
I hope you like pink.

19:21.995 --> 19:23.286
You know mom loves
an accent pillow.

19:25.748 --> 19:26.289
- Is that supposed to be open?

19:28.543 --> 19:32.545
- God, whoever rented it last
must have left it, idiots.

19:32.589 --> 19:33.963
I hope there's not water damage.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.756
I don't want my parents
thinking it was us.

19:44.475 --> 19:45.308
You're being weird.

19:49.397 --> 19:49.437
Wine.

19:59.866 --> 20:02.533
(wind whooshing)

20:05.622 --> 20:07.496
(birds chirping)

20:11.669 --> 20:13.419
(water flowing)

20:19.385 --> 20:22.261
(birds chirping)

20:22.305 --> 20:24.889
(poignant music)

20:49.499 --> 20:52.208
(door creaking)

20:54.504 --> 20:54.752
- Amy?

21:10.603 --> 21:11.352
(calm music)

21:11.396 --> 21:14.188
(food sizzling)

21:21.447 --> 21:21.487
Stop that.

21:25.660 --> 21:28.995
♪ I fight, still I call ♪

21:29.038 --> 21:31.205
- It is a shame you're
never in your own photos.

21:31.249 --> 21:33.291
- Yeah, I prefer it that way.

21:34.877 --> 21:36.627
(phone beeps)
- Oh, my phone's dying.

21:36.671 --> 21:37.670
Do you have your charger?

21:37.714 --> 21:38.546
- Where's yours.

21:38.589 --> 21:42.049
- Mm, I might've forgotten it.

21:42.093 --> 21:42.967
But that's what I have you for.

21:43.011 --> 21:45.011
It's just for the music anyway.

21:45.054 --> 21:45.886
- By the computer.

21:49.309 --> 21:50.391
- Ah-hah!

21:52.729 --> 21:55.396
See, this one is fun.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.690
Don't you wanna skip
stupid Derek's stupid show

21:57.734 --> 22:00.192
and stay here all
weekend with me?

22:02.697 --> 22:07.325
Tara, when are you gonna
realize that he's a jerk

22:07.368 --> 22:08.951
and he is never gonna change

22:08.995 --> 22:09.577
and that you need to move on?

22:11.581 --> 22:12.830
- I care about him, Amy.

22:14.083 --> 22:14.790
I just think

22:15.918 --> 22:17.126
it's not a bad thing to be there

22:17.170 --> 22:19.170
for people you care about.

22:19.213 --> 22:20.588
- And I commend you

22:20.631 --> 22:21.922
for always seeing
the best in people.

22:21.966 --> 22:26.135
really, I do, even when
it is very hard to find.

22:26.179 --> 22:29.680
But you have got to
stop letting people

22:29.724 --> 22:30.598
take advantage of you.

22:31.934 --> 22:34.101
- That's easy for you to say.

22:34.145 --> 22:35.603
You could have any guy you want.

22:35.646 --> 22:37.772
- Girl, have you
seen these photos?!

22:37.815 --> 22:39.148
So could you.

22:40.777 --> 22:41.609
Okay, subject change.

22:41.652 --> 22:43.819
Guess who has a new book project

22:43.863 --> 22:47.406
that obviously needs to be
the center of my universe?

22:47.450 --> 22:49.200
- Oo, what does mommy dearest

22:49.243 --> 22:50.659
have us working on this time?

22:50.703 --> 22:52.328
- Who knows.

22:52.372 --> 22:53.412
- Plates.

22:53.998 --> 22:57.375
- Heaven forbid I have
a life outside of her.

22:58.461 --> 23:00.544
I wish my parents
were more like yours.

23:00.588 --> 23:02.088
- You mean totally absent?

23:02.131 --> 23:04.131
- Well, that's not fair.

23:04.175 --> 23:06.384
Their absence isn't
entirely their fault.

23:06.427 --> 23:09.929
I mean, I've seen you ignore
your mom's phone calls.

23:10.848 --> 23:13.516
- You don't know--
(door bangs)

23:13.559 --> 23:15.893
(mysterious music)

23:15.937 --> 23:16.519
- What was that?

23:25.279 --> 23:26.153
- Looks like my door.

23:37.250 --> 23:38.290
- It's a draft.

23:38.334 --> 23:38.833
I thought I told
you to close it.

23:38.876 --> 23:42.253
(birds chirping)

23:44.549 --> 23:45.548
- I thought I did.

23:45.591 --> 23:48.509
- Well, obviously
not all the way.

23:48.553 --> 23:50.469
Just remember to
lock it this time.

24:05.653 --> 24:08.195
(water gushing)

24:15.746 --> 24:16.579
- Tara!

24:18.708 --> 24:21.083
(Tara panting)

24:53.493 --> 24:55.576
(tense music)

25:28.277 --> 25:30.945
(Tara gasps)

25:30.988 --> 25:33.697
(Tara panting)

25:42.250 --> 25:44.375
- Are you awake?

25:47.004 --> 25:48.754
- Come up.

26:05.106 --> 26:07.106
(birds chirping)

26:07.149 --> 26:10.109
(mysterious music)

26:17.201 --> 26:18.993
- Hey guys, Tara here.

26:19.036 --> 26:21.203
As promised, the
view from the porch.

26:21.247 --> 26:22.913
There are worst
places to work, right?

26:22.957 --> 26:24.081
I'm about to head
down to the lake,

26:24.125 --> 26:24.873
and I'm gonna to try
to convince my friend

26:24.917 --> 26:26.041
to do some modeling for me

26:26.085 --> 26:28.085
so we can test out the
new portraiture lens.

26:28.129 --> 26:30.296
- You ready to head down?

26:30.339 --> 26:32.756
- Shouldn't take
much convincing.

26:34.427 --> 26:36.802
(waves lapping)

26:36.846 --> 26:38.637
- Okay, try one
looking up at the sky.

26:41.225 --> 26:42.641
Okay, try away

26:42.685 --> 26:45.561
just so we can see the back
of your hat for a second.

26:47.315 --> 26:49.440
Oh, these are
actually pretty great.

26:49.483 --> 26:51.150
- You sound surprised.

26:51.193 --> 26:52.943
Don't forget who was
crowned Little Miss Bedford.

26:53.029 --> 26:54.653
Still got it.

26:54.697 --> 26:55.821
- When was that?

26:55.865 --> 26:56.989
- I was eight.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.034
- Yeah, maybe it's just
a really great lens.

27:00.077 --> 27:01.702
- Rude!

27:01.746 --> 27:02.536
Okay, put it away.

27:02.580 --> 27:03.912
Let's go swim.
- I'm good.

27:04.415 --> 27:04.455
- Please.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.086
Please.

27:12.632 --> 27:13.756
(both giggle)

27:13.799 --> 27:15.299
- I'm enjoying the sun.

27:15.343 --> 27:17.676
- (sighs) I don't
wanna swim alone.

27:17.720 --> 27:18.260
Besides it'll be good for you.

27:20.514 --> 27:21.597
- Good for me.

27:21.724 --> 27:23.474
Am I missing something here?

27:23.517 --> 27:27.061
It's new chapter, come
to face your fears.

27:29.065 --> 27:29.104
- What are...

27:30.733 --> 27:32.566
Oh my, this is about John.

27:32.610 --> 27:33.275
- I don't know what
you're talking you about.

27:33.319 --> 27:34.151
- Yeah, you do.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.656
You even asked me before

27:38.699 --> 27:40.366
if I didn't wanna
come because of him.

27:40.409 --> 27:42.201
- If I did, I don't remember it.

27:43.454 --> 27:46.330
Babe, this is not about
you and your brother.

27:46.374 --> 27:48.207
This is about me trying
to get you to loosen up

27:48.250 --> 27:50.000
and have a good time.

27:50.044 --> 27:52.044
Everything with you is so heavy.

27:52.338 --> 27:54.213
- He died Amy.

27:55.466 --> 27:57.007
- 10 years ago.

28:00.179 --> 28:01.720
You can't keep using
him as an excuse--

28:01.764 --> 28:03.138
- Using him as an excuse?!

28:03.182 --> 28:04.890
- You know what I mean?

28:04.934 --> 28:05.307
- You know, I don't think I do.

28:06.936 --> 28:10.938
You have no idea what
it's like to lose someone,

28:10.981 --> 28:13.524
to feel responsible,

28:13.567 --> 28:15.943
to have your own mother
and father resent you

28:15.986 --> 28:16.652
for being the one who survived.

28:16.696 --> 28:18.153
- They don't resent you.

28:18.197 --> 28:20.364
- You have no idea, Amy.

28:20.408 --> 28:22.324
You think you have this great
understanding of my life.

28:23.244 --> 28:26.412
You don't have a clue!

28:26.455 --> 28:28.247
Worry about your own problems.

28:28.290 --> 28:29.581
You're always complaining

28:29.625 --> 28:31.834
that your mom is so
controlling and so demanding.

28:31.877 --> 28:32.751
Leave!

28:33.921 --> 28:35.754
Oh, but who's gonna
pay for all this.

28:35.798 --> 28:37.172
- That's really not fair.

28:37.216 --> 28:39.216
- Life isn't fair.

28:39.260 --> 28:40.884
And the sooner you stop trying
to convince me otherwise,

28:40.928 --> 28:42.302
the better.

28:52.690 --> 28:52.896
- Hey.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.232
I'm sorry

28:57.361 --> 28:59.236
It's just I see you
constantly punishing yourself,

28:59.280 --> 29:00.988
and honestly it breaks my heart.

29:02.366 --> 29:03.657
Like with guys like Derek.

29:04.827 --> 29:06.034
I think you stick around

29:06.078 --> 29:07.828
because you don't think
you deserve better.

29:09.081 --> 29:09.955
You do.

29:09.999 --> 29:15.419
(bird cawing)
(waves lapping)

29:15.463 --> 29:17.880
- (sighs) I have an idea.

29:17.923 --> 29:18.756
- Yeah?

29:19.759 --> 29:22.551
- How about we don't
talk about guys anymore?

29:23.637 --> 29:26.722
Let's just focus on you and
me for the rest of the trip.

29:26.766 --> 29:28.182
How does that sound?

29:29.935 --> 29:31.894
- (gasps) Does that
mean you are staying?

29:31.937 --> 29:33.312
- I didn't say that.

29:33.355 --> 29:36.231
No, I'm still debating.

29:36.275 --> 29:40.778
- Woo-hoo!
(Tara groans)

29:48.496 --> 29:49.369
- I was thinking
about what you said.

29:50.414 --> 29:52.289
- What did I say?

29:52.708 --> 29:54.541
- That I complain
about my parents

29:54.585 --> 29:57.377
but have no problem
letting them support me.

29:58.798 --> 30:00.005
- I'm sorry, I was upset--

30:00.049 --> 30:03.467
- No, no, you're right.

30:03.511 --> 30:04.885
I am totally dependent on them.

30:06.305 --> 30:09.431
Which is why, I guess,
I'm so envious of you.

30:09.475 --> 30:10.599
- Envious of me?

30:10.643 --> 30:11.767
- Yeah!

30:11.811 --> 30:14.019
I mean, I have no idea
what it would be like

30:14.063 --> 30:17.981
to have no one expect
anything of me, you know,

30:18.025 --> 30:18.857
to have that kind of freedom.

30:18.943 --> 30:22.027
(birds chirping)

30:29.745 --> 30:31.370
- Hey, sorry.
(Tara gasps)

30:31.413 --> 30:33.497
I didn't mean to scare you.

30:36.043 --> 30:37.835
- Can we help you?

30:37.878 --> 30:38.252
- No, well maybe.

30:39.713 --> 30:41.463
I was down by the lake when
I saw you two across the way,

30:41.507 --> 30:44.007
but you left before
I could say hi.

30:45.052 --> 30:46.510
- And what are you
doing out here?

30:47.721 --> 30:49.471
- Well, I guess you could
say I'm Cheryl Strayeding it.

30:53.519 --> 30:55.018
- I'm sorry, what?

30:55.104 --> 30:57.312
- It's Cheryl Strayed.

30:57.356 --> 30:57.896
"Wild?"

30:59.775 --> 31:01.775
It's one of my favorite books,
I did a whole vlog about it.

31:01.819 --> 31:02.609
- Oh.

31:03.362 --> 31:05.445
- Well, Cheryl.

31:05.489 --> 31:08.031
- (chuckles) It's
Lucas, actually.

31:09.368 --> 31:10.701
Look, I don't wanna
bother you two,

31:10.744 --> 31:12.119
I was just wondering if
maybe you knew of a place

31:12.162 --> 31:14.037
where I could charge
my phone for a bit?

31:14.582 --> 31:17.666
- Did Cheryl Strayed
have a phone?

31:17.710 --> 31:19.042
- I don't think so,

31:19.086 --> 31:20.335
but she's way tougher than me.

31:20.379 --> 31:22.963
(Tara chuckles)

31:23.007 --> 31:24.882
(Amy giggles)

31:24.925 --> 31:27.551
- As a matter of fact, we have
a place right off the trail.

31:27.595 --> 31:29.887
But you know, there's no
service out here, right?

31:29.930 --> 31:31.597
- Yeah, I figured as much.

31:32.725 --> 31:33.849
Still it wouldn't hurt
to have some juice

31:33.893 --> 31:36.768
in case I eventually
come across some bars.

31:38.397 --> 31:40.147
- Sure.

31:40.190 --> 31:40.689
I'm Amy.

31:40.733 --> 31:41.315
This is Tara.

31:42.568 --> 31:43.317
Follow us.

32:03.923 --> 32:04.755
- Wow.

32:04.798 --> 32:06.173
- That's what I said too.

32:06.216 --> 32:07.966
- It's in massive
need of an update,

32:08.010 --> 32:09.301
but it does the trick.

32:09.345 --> 32:11.136
- And it's just the
two of you here?

32:11.180 --> 32:13.305
- Why do you ask?

32:13.349 --> 32:15.474
- Just seems a little dangerous.

32:15.517 --> 32:17.309
Two attractive young ladies

32:17.353 --> 32:19.227
alone in a big old
house like this.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.521
I feel like I've seen
this movie before.

32:21.565 --> 32:24.024
- (titters) That's funny.

32:24.068 --> 32:27.194
You're funny.

32:27.237 --> 32:29.071
So do you have a charger
or do you need one?

32:29.198 --> 32:30.030
- Oh, no, I'm good.

32:30.074 --> 32:31.114
- Fabulous.

32:31.158 --> 32:32.449
Charge away!

32:34.161 --> 32:35.577
I'm gonna go grab a shower.

32:35.621 --> 32:36.870
Do you mind?

32:36.914 --> 32:38.747
He's totally the
perfect rebound.

32:38.791 --> 32:39.998
Go for it.

32:40.042 --> 32:41.750
You kids have fun.

32:41.794 --> 32:44.002
- If I miss you, thank
you for the hospitality.

32:44.046 --> 32:46.797
I should be out of
here in like 10.

32:46.840 --> 32:49.132
- No, no, no, no, no,
make yourself at home.

32:49.176 --> 32:51.009
I'll be right back down.

32:51.053 --> 32:53.929
(mysterious music)

32:54.306 --> 32:57.808
(Lucas exhales)

33:01.146 --> 33:03.188
- So you just out here doing
some soul searching, huh?

33:03.232 --> 33:05.774
- Yeah, yeah,
something like that.

33:07.486 --> 33:08.777
I noticed your camera

33:08.821 --> 33:10.445
and some pretty serious
equipment you got there.

33:14.201 --> 33:17.077
- Yeah, well I'm far from a
pretty serious photographer.

33:18.622 --> 33:19.830
- I dabble a bit myself.

33:21.875 --> 33:25.002
Though, I would have no idea
how to make a career out of it.

33:25.045 --> 33:25.836
- That makes two of us.

33:25.879 --> 33:27.337
- What's that?

33:27.381 --> 33:30.173
- It's a work in progress.

33:30.217 --> 33:32.384
Let's just leave it at that.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.220
- Aren't we all just
works in progress?

33:52.531 --> 33:54.239
- To our new friend

33:54.283 --> 33:56.158
on the beginning of
his hero's journey,

33:56.201 --> 33:59.244
and to my bestest friend

33:59.288 --> 34:01.455
on the beginning
of her new chapter.

34:02.583 --> 34:05.417
(glasses clinking)

34:06.962 --> 34:08.086
- So I'm gathering
that the two of you

34:08.130 --> 34:10.172
have known each other
for a very long time.

34:10.215 --> 34:11.381
- Oh, a long time.

34:11.425 --> 34:13.341
- Why do you say it like that?

34:13.385 --> 34:14.676
Like it's a bad thing?

34:14.720 --> 34:16.261
- I didn't, I just
think it's kind of scary

34:16.305 --> 34:18.180
when you think about

34:18.223 --> 34:19.890
how long we've actually
known each other.

34:19.933 --> 34:22.434
Amy was my first friend when
my family moved to town.

34:22.478 --> 34:24.227
- And nemesis.

34:24.271 --> 34:25.437
- It's a little
bit of a stretch.

34:25.481 --> 34:26.772
- Are you kidding me?

34:26.815 --> 34:28.440
We were famous for that fight.

34:28.484 --> 34:29.941
- Fight?
- Mm-hmm.

34:29.985 --> 34:31.109
That's how we met.

34:31.195 --> 34:32.194
I was dragged to
this fraternity.

34:32.237 --> 34:34.279
- Oh, the robe.

34:34.323 --> 34:35.822
- And someone was
holding up the bathroom.

34:35.866 --> 34:37.199
- I was having a moment.

34:37.242 --> 34:38.033
- So I started
banging on the door.

34:38.077 --> 34:39.534
- In this totally rude way.

34:39.578 --> 34:42.370
- And Amy, let me know just
how rude she thought I was.

34:42.414 --> 34:45.874
- And Tara called
me a hypocrite.

34:45.918 --> 34:48.418
- There was copious amounts
of cheap liquor involved,

34:48.462 --> 34:50.879
so things really went
downhill from there.

34:50.923 --> 34:53.715
- I think there's still
a video of it somewhere.

34:53.759 --> 34:54.424
- We've come a long
way since then.

34:54.468 --> 34:56.343
- Oh, like fine wines.

34:56.386 --> 34:59.596
- I was in this new place,
I didn't know anyone.

34:59.640 --> 35:03.266
And then this girl that I
get in a massive fight with

35:03.393 --> 35:04.851
in front of everyone,

35:04.895 --> 35:05.560
somehow ends up
giving me a ride home.

35:05.604 --> 35:07.020
- With my driver.

35:07.064 --> 35:08.522
- And by the end of the ride,

35:08.565 --> 35:11.900
I'm confiding in her and
I'm crying with her, and...

35:15.030 --> 35:17.447
You were really there
for me that year.

35:17.491 --> 35:18.323
I don't know what I
would've done without you.

35:18.367 --> 35:21.993
(poignant music)

35:24.706 --> 35:26.164
- Freshman year can be tough.

35:29.628 --> 35:32.379
- Yeah, it wasn't really
that, it was my brother.

35:33.507 --> 35:36.341
Sorry, I don't really
talk about it often,

35:36.385 --> 35:39.136
but we lost my brother that year

35:39.179 --> 35:41.304
and it just kind of
ripped my family apart.

35:44.017 --> 35:45.267
We moved because...

35:47.104 --> 35:49.437
I don't know because my mom
thought it would be better

35:49.481 --> 35:50.438
to start fresh somewhere else.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.316
But we didn't
really start fresh.

35:54.862 --> 35:56.194
There was nothing to start.

35:58.073 --> 36:00.699
It was actually
more like the end.

36:02.536 --> 36:03.326
- I'm sorry.

36:04.872 --> 36:06.746
- It was a long time ago.

36:08.292 --> 36:11.626
I moved out on my own and
Amy became my new family.

36:13.338 --> 36:14.296
I don't really talk
to my parents anymore.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.633
I think they just
couldn't look at me

36:18.677 --> 36:20.635
without being overwhelmed

36:20.679 --> 36:22.429
at how much they
miss my brother, so.

36:29.897 --> 36:31.479
Anyway, here we are.

36:31.523 --> 36:34.274
Sorry, I didn't mean to--
- No, it's...

36:36.153 --> 36:37.360
I know what it's like
to lose someone you love

36:39.615 --> 36:41.198
even if it was a long time ago

36:41.241 --> 36:43.617
when everyone keeps telling
you it's time to move on.

36:44.620 --> 36:45.285
- It was 10 years ago.

36:45.329 --> 36:46.578
- Amy!

36:46.622 --> 36:50.457
- I mean, don't you think
she should reach out?

36:50.500 --> 36:52.542
- I don't think--
- It's time.

36:52.586 --> 36:56.213
- I think Tara could
probably decide for herself.

37:04.806 --> 37:06.473
- So Lucas, what do you do?

37:08.435 --> 37:10.060
- I'm a pharmacist actually.

37:10.103 --> 37:11.269
- Oh!
- Yeah.

37:11.313 --> 37:13.313
Well, I used to be.

37:13.357 --> 37:14.898
- Used to be?

37:14.942 --> 37:16.816
- Yeah, I don't know, I just,

37:16.860 --> 37:19.319
I recently had a
change of heart.

37:19.363 --> 37:21.571
I got into it because I
wanted to help people,

37:21.615 --> 37:24.908
and lately it just feels
like I'm serving big pharma.

37:24.952 --> 37:27.035
So I got out.

37:27.079 --> 37:29.079
- So you're just out here
in the middle of nowhere.

37:29.122 --> 37:31.706
Looking for what?

37:31.750 --> 37:33.333
- (chuckles) I guess I'll
know it when I see it.

37:35.462 --> 37:36.670
What about you two?

37:36.713 --> 37:39.881
I know you're a
photographer, Tara.

37:39.925 --> 37:41.341
- Yeah, well, she could be

37:41.385 --> 37:43.468
if she'd ever get rid of that
embarrassing waitress job.

37:43.512 --> 37:45.303
- Thanks, Amy.

37:45.347 --> 37:47.264
- No, that's not what I mean.

37:47.307 --> 37:49.766
It's just you have
so much talent

37:49.810 --> 37:53.645
and you are wasting it at
that dumpy tourist trap.

37:53.689 --> 37:55.355
You could be making
so much more money

37:55.399 --> 37:58.108
than minimum wage and bad tips.

37:58.151 --> 37:59.859
And then maybe you
could afford a car

37:59.903 --> 38:01.069
that doesn't sound
like a death rattle.

38:01.113 --> 38:02.862
- You got car trouble?
- No, it's fine.

38:02.906 --> 38:04.322
- I could take a
look if you'd like.

38:04.366 --> 38:05.490
- Would you, please?

38:05.534 --> 38:07.742
I feel like I am risking my life

38:07.786 --> 38:09.577
every time I get
into that thing.

38:09.621 --> 38:10.829
- It's fine.
- I got tools in my car.

38:10.872 --> 38:13.540
It's not a big deal.
- Wait, you have a car.

38:13.583 --> 38:15.625
I thought you were
eat, pray, loving this.

38:15.669 --> 38:16.751
- (chuckles) I am.

38:16.795 --> 38:18.211
I'm just starting.

38:18.255 --> 38:20.588
It's not too far from the lake.

38:20.632 --> 38:23.341
- Well, maybe when Amy's done
roasting me, we can go get it.

38:23.385 --> 38:25.844
- I'm not roasting you.

38:25.887 --> 38:26.928
God, she's so sensitive.

38:26.972 --> 38:28.013
I'm just being honest.

38:28.056 --> 38:30.682
You have so much
potential, you know.

38:32.060 --> 38:33.810
- What about you, Amy?

38:34.688 --> 38:35.437
What do you do?

38:40.277 --> 38:41.609
I work with my parents actually.

38:47.117 --> 38:48.950
You seem like a really nice guy,

38:48.994 --> 38:50.577
and ordinarily I would invite
you to stay the weekend,

38:50.620 --> 38:55.206
but unfortunately
Tara's boyfriend

38:55.250 --> 38:56.249
is playing a show.
- Amy!

38:56.293 --> 38:57.167
- So we have to
get back for that.

38:57.210 --> 38:59.919
So.
- He's not my boyfriend.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.964
He dumped me this week actually.

39:03.008 --> 39:04.466
- Oh, they've been
on and off for years.

39:04.509 --> 39:05.508
- Lucky guy.

39:05.552 --> 39:06.885
- Well this time we're off.

39:07.721 --> 39:08.511
For good.

39:11.683 --> 39:12.974
I'm not going to the show.

39:15.437 --> 39:15.935
- You're not?

39:15.979 --> 39:17.187
- No, I'm not.

39:21.068 --> 39:22.817
We're gonna be staying here
for the rest of the weekend.

39:22.861 --> 39:26.321
And you're welcome to stay with
us for as long as you like.

39:26.365 --> 39:27.113
Right Amy?

39:28.617 --> 39:30.408
- Right!

39:32.621 --> 39:35.455
I'm gonna get another
bottle of wine.

39:35.499 --> 39:37.207
They keep the best
ones in the cellar.

39:42.589 --> 39:45.090
- She's fun.

39:45.133 --> 39:47.008
- She comes off a
bit harsh sometimes.

39:47.052 --> 39:51.096
But the truth is she's
a really good friend

39:51.139 --> 39:54.891
and she's been there
for me for a lot.

39:58.772 --> 40:01.398
You know, you remind
me of someone,

40:02.651 --> 40:04.859
or maybe we've run into each
other before or something.

40:06.822 --> 40:08.405
Where did you say you were from?

40:11.910 --> 40:13.660
- I see you, you know.

40:16.206 --> 40:17.163
- I'm sorry.

40:27.134 --> 40:29.676
- I found us something a
little more exciting than wine.

40:30.846 --> 40:32.512
(Amy chuckles)

40:34.391 --> 40:37.142
(water pattering)

40:49.030 --> 40:51.865
(mysterious music)

41:24.316 --> 41:25.064
- Amy?

41:46.755 --> 41:49.130
Amy, if you're gonna
borrow my stuff,

41:49.174 --> 41:50.798
you need to put it
back when you're done.

41:50.842 --> 41:51.966
- [Amy] I don't know what
you're talking about.

41:52.010 --> 41:53.343
- My perfume.

41:53.386 --> 41:55.053
- [Amy] I didn't take it.

41:55.096 --> 41:55.887
- Right.

42:10.570 --> 42:12.278
- Hey guys, Tara here.

42:12.322 --> 42:14.489
As promised the
view from the porch.

42:14.533 --> 42:16.407
There are worst
places to work, right?

42:16.451 --> 42:17.909
I'm about to head
down to the lake,

42:17.953 --> 42:18.868
and I'm gonna try to
convince my friend

42:18.912 --> 42:20.036
to do some modeling for me

42:20.080 --> 42:22.080
so we can test out the
new portraiture lens.

42:23.124 --> 42:26.876
(ominous music)

42:29.798 --> 42:31.339
Hey guys, Tara here.

42:31.383 --> 42:33.633
As promised the
view from the porch.

42:33.677 --> 42:35.468
There are worst
places to work, right?

42:35.512 --> 42:37.011
I'm about to head
down to the lake,

42:37.055 --> 42:37.804
and I'm gonna try to
convince my friend

42:37.847 --> 42:38.972
to do some modeling for me

42:39.015 --> 42:42.767
so we can test out the
new portraiture lens.

42:44.104 --> 42:46.104
(Tara gasps)

43:02.163 --> 43:04.998
(mysterious music)

43:17.637 --> 43:20.471
(electronic music)

43:26.187 --> 43:29.856
(both laughing)

43:30.317 --> 43:33.401
- [Lucas] Oh, there you are.

43:33.445 --> 43:36.070
- Hey.
- Amy, can I talk to you?

43:36.114 --> 43:37.030
There's something
I need to show you.

43:37.073 --> 43:38.114
- Right now?

43:38.158 --> 43:39.782
- Yes, right now.

43:39.826 --> 43:40.742
- We're just getting started.

43:40.785 --> 43:42.827
- Have a drink, babe.
- Join us.

- I can smell my perfume.

44:16.029 --> 44:18.780
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

44:18.823 --> 44:19.697
- You're up, Amy.

44:24.829 --> 44:27.580
What was it you
wanted to show Amy?

44:27.624 --> 44:28.289
- Nothing.

44:29.959 --> 44:30.249
It was nothing.

44:33.380 --> 44:36.464
- You wanna show me instead?

45:56.421 --> 45:59.130
- Hey there sleepy head.

45:59.174 --> 46:00.548
How are you feeling?

46:00.592 --> 46:02.300
- Why didn't you wake me up?

46:02.343 --> 46:03.509
- I figured I'd wait
till I was finished

46:03.553 --> 46:05.678
making breakfast first.

46:05.722 --> 46:08.473
This one isn't used to
that kind of a good time.

46:08.516 --> 46:09.640
- I'd never have known.

46:11.436 --> 46:13.102
- Have you seen
my phone charger?

46:13.146 --> 46:13.936
I can't find it.

46:13.980 --> 46:15.730
- Oh, that's not surprising.

46:15.774 --> 46:18.357
She's always losing, slash
misplacing her things.

46:18.401 --> 46:20.401
- Am I?

46:20.445 --> 46:21.819
This is news to me.

46:23.323 --> 46:25.156
- Well, somebody woke up

46:25.200 --> 46:26.407
on the wrong side of
the bed this morning.

46:26.451 --> 46:29.577
- Well, someone should
stop borrowing my stuff

46:29.621 --> 46:32.205
and then misplacing it and
accusing me of losing it.

46:32.457 --> 46:35.833
(Amy titters)

46:36.961 --> 46:38.169
- I think I'll go take
a look at the car.

46:38.213 --> 46:39.212
- You don't have to do that.
- I know.

46:39.255 --> 46:41.088
I just figure it's
safer out there

46:41.132 --> 46:42.715
than in this line of fire.

46:42.759 --> 46:44.091
- The keys are by the door.

46:45.178 --> 46:47.887
- Play nicely.
(Amy giggles)

46:50.517 --> 46:52.433
- Play nice.

46:52.477 --> 46:54.644
Great, now he thinks
we're psychos.

46:54.687 --> 46:55.561
- We?

46:55.605 --> 46:56.312
You're the one being paranoid.

46:56.356 --> 46:58.731
I'm just making pancakes.

46:59.692 --> 47:01.275
- I'm not paranoid.

47:01.319 --> 47:02.568
It's my stuffy, Amy, and
it's not where I put it.

47:02.612 --> 47:06.531
- Okay, everybody
misplaces things.

47:06.574 --> 47:07.990
You had a lot to
drink last night,

47:08.034 --> 47:09.992
you probably just don't
remember where you put it.

47:10.036 --> 47:11.577
- Or you don't.

47:11.621 --> 47:13.955
I wasn't the only one
drinking last night.

47:13.998 --> 47:16.332
- Okay, I'll keep
my eyes open for it.

47:16.376 --> 47:18.626
It's not that big of a deal.

47:18.670 --> 47:20.294
- It is a big deal.

47:20.338 --> 47:21.754
It's my stuff, Amy.

47:21.798 --> 47:23.297
And you always do this.

47:23.341 --> 47:25.424
You always think you can
just take whatever you want,

47:25.468 --> 47:28.886
- I'm always taking your things?

47:28.930 --> 47:30.304
- Yes.

47:30.348 --> 47:32.306
There are no boundaries with
you and there should be.

47:32.350 --> 47:34.225
- Okay, we are talking
about a phone charger here.

47:34.269 --> 47:35.268
Do you hear yourself?

47:35.311 --> 47:36.435
- It's not about
the phone charger.

47:36.479 --> 47:37.478
- Then what is it about?
- It's about...

47:39.732 --> 47:41.357
(Tara sighs)

47:41.401 --> 47:43.192
Forget it.

47:46.698 --> 47:49.532
- Are you upset because
Lucas was coming on to me?

47:53.496 --> 47:54.287
Tara.

47:57.333 --> 48:00.710
You have been talking
all week about Derek

48:00.795 --> 48:03.921
and how much you miss
him, and care about him,

48:03.965 --> 48:06.883
and wanna get back
to see his show.

48:06.926 --> 48:09.927
Does any of this indicate
to me that you're interested

48:09.971 --> 48:11.721
in hooking up with
random mountain man?

48:12.724 --> 48:13.848
No!

48:13.892 --> 48:16.767
I don't understand why
you're upset with me

48:16.811 --> 48:20.813
when I had no idea that you
were trying to impress Lucas.

48:20.857 --> 48:21.522
- I'm not trying to impress him.

48:21.566 --> 48:23.733
- Oh my god.

48:23.776 --> 48:25.443
I don't even know what
we're talking about anymore.

48:25.486 --> 48:26.611
Tara, I can't keep up.

48:26.654 --> 48:27.945
- It's the way you're saying it.

48:27.989 --> 48:30.031
I'm not trying to impress him.

48:30.074 --> 48:32.158
I'm just--
- You're just what?

48:34.370 --> 48:37.622
(sighs) This is not
what I was looking for.

48:37.665 --> 48:42.084
I don't know why I go out of
my way to be so nice to you

48:42.128 --> 48:43.461
when you treat me like this,

48:43.504 --> 48:47.048
when you get
randomly angry at me

48:47.091 --> 48:50.176
and accuse me of doing
things that I'm not doing.

48:50.219 --> 48:51.594
- You are doing it though, Amy

48:53.514 --> 48:55.598
- Look, if you want
Lucas, go for it.

48:55.642 --> 48:57.516
But don't get mad at
me for being myself

48:57.560 --> 49:00.061
and trying to have fun,

49:00.104 --> 49:00.853
just because you don't
have the strength

49:00.897 --> 49:02.563
to go after what you want.

49:05.485 --> 49:08.277
(Lucas exhales)

49:14.369 --> 49:15.993
- You fixed it.

49:16.037 --> 49:16.494
- It just need a little love.

49:18.539 --> 49:20.039
- You're my hero.

49:20.083 --> 49:21.749
(Lucas chuckles)

49:21.793 --> 49:22.541
- Anytime.

49:22.585 --> 49:24.627
(calm music)

49:24.671 --> 49:25.878
(birds chirping)

49:25.922 --> 49:27.505
- Breakfast is ready
and the battle is over,

49:27.548 --> 49:29.840
if you wanna come back inside.

49:31.010 --> 49:33.219
Sorry you had to hear
all that, Amy and I.

49:33.262 --> 49:35.179
- Oh no, it's all good.

49:35.223 --> 49:36.722
No need to explain.

49:42.230 --> 49:44.105
- Well, come in

50:07.922 --> 50:09.964
You're gonna join me
before it gets cold?

50:10.008 --> 50:12.174
- It smells delicious.

50:12.218 --> 50:15.386
Let me just wash up,
and I'll be right back.

50:15.430 --> 50:17.722
- I swear you were the last
person to use the charger, Amy.

50:17.765 --> 50:19.598
- I will literally
buy you 50 chargers

50:19.642 --> 50:22.184
if you never bring
this up again.

50:22.228 --> 50:23.811
- Look, I need to
show you something.

50:23.855 --> 50:25.104
This is what I was
talking about last night.

50:25.148 --> 50:27.440
There was someone watching
us yesterday morning,

50:27.483 --> 50:28.983
and I caught them on tape.

50:29.027 --> 50:31.902
(mysterious music)

50:35.074 --> 50:36.657
- The suspense is killing me.

50:36.701 --> 50:38.034
- It's gone.

50:38.077 --> 50:39.452
- What's gone?
- My vlog file, it's gone.

50:40.538 --> 50:43.372
- You know what I think,

50:43.416 --> 50:45.708
I think we need to put
away the brown liquors

50:45.752 --> 50:47.543
and stick with the wine tonight.

50:47.587 --> 50:49.503
- No, it was here, I saw it.

50:51.758 --> 50:53.299
- Thanks for waiting.

50:53.342 --> 50:55.009
This looks incredible.

50:58.056 --> 50:58.846
You okay?

51:00.641 --> 51:04.018
- Yeah, I'm fine.

51:04.062 --> 51:05.269
- Pancake?
- Thank you.

51:07.231 --> 51:07.688
Tara, pancakes?

51:15.740 --> 51:18.657

(waves lapping)

52:31.524 --> 52:34.817
(camera shutter clicking)

52:38.030 --> 52:38.487
- All right.

52:40.366 --> 52:42.575
(tense music)

52:42.618 --> 52:44.034
(Tara gasps)

52:44.078 --> 52:44.827
- Sorry.

52:45.788 --> 52:47.413
- That's okay.

52:47.456 --> 52:48.247
- This seat taken?

52:49.542 --> 52:52.042
I gotta stop creeping
up on you like this.

52:53.754 --> 52:57.089
(Lucas sighs)

52:58.843 --> 53:01.635
(Lucas exhales)

53:05.766 --> 53:09.685
- Last night when you
said you've seen me,

53:09.729 --> 53:10.728
what did you mean by that?

53:20.489 --> 53:23.908
- I haven't been
completely honest with you.

53:24.994 --> 53:25.784
I didn't exactly
need a phone charge.

53:29.040 --> 53:30.539
When I saw you yesterday

53:30.958 --> 53:33.792
sitting right here actually,

53:36.714 --> 53:37.338
I just knew.

53:39.926 --> 53:39.965
- Knew what?

53:43.262 --> 53:45.930
- That I finally found
what I was looking for.

53:47.892 --> 53:50.851
That everything else up until
that moment didn't matter.

53:55.441 --> 53:56.232
What?

53:57.151 --> 53:59.860
Is that really so
hard to believe?

53:59.904 --> 54:02.071
- I don't know, Lucas.

54:04.784 --> 54:05.991
I don't feel like
it works like that.

54:07.578 --> 54:08.410
Guys like you,

54:10.039 --> 54:10.788
and girls like me.

54:16.087 --> 54:19.713
- You really don't
see it, do you?

54:21.467 --> 54:23.217
- Besides I thought you and Amy

54:23.261 --> 54:24.802
had something going
on last night.

54:24.845 --> 54:24.885
- Amy?

54:25.930 --> 54:27.680
- Yeah.

54:32.395 --> 54:33.644
- Can I tell you a secret?

54:46.701 --> 54:47.950
You're wrong.

55:02.425 --> 55:05.259
- You said your car's
around here somewhere.

55:13.769 --> 55:15.894
(Derek knocking)

55:15.938 --> 55:17.646
- [Derek] Tara.

55:18.566 --> 55:19.273
(Derek knocking)

55:19.317 --> 55:21.400
Tara, are you in there?

55:22.945 --> 55:22.985
Tara.

55:27.825 --> 55:30.367
- Derek?

55:30.411 --> 55:31.660
What are you doing here?

55:32.288 --> 55:34.747
- [Derek] Listen,
I made a mistake.

55:35.416 --> 55:38.500
- Don't you think it's
a little late for that?

55:38.544 --> 55:39.710
- [Derek] I'm hoping not.

55:40.880 --> 55:41.545
Can I come in?

55:41.589 --> 55:42.629
- How did you find me?

55:44.175 --> 55:46.383
- Come on, you post
your entire life online.

55:46.427 --> 55:48.385
- I didn't post anything
about being here.

55:48.429 --> 55:49.595
- Your last vlog, you said

55:49.638 --> 55:50.804
that you were at a
friend's family's lake.

55:50.848 --> 55:52.056
It doesn't take a
genius to look up a lake

55:52.099 --> 55:53.098
with Amy's last name.

55:55.478 --> 55:55.976
(titters) Okay.

55:58.522 --> 55:59.730
- What do you want Derek?

56:02.193 --> 56:04.818
- I want you to
come back with me.

56:04.862 --> 56:06.695
I want you to come
to the show tonight.

56:08.532 --> 56:10.616
- I don't think
that's a good idea.

56:10.659 --> 56:11.700
- Why not?

56:11.744 --> 56:13.410
- Because you dumped me Derek.

56:13.454 --> 56:14.828
In a voicemail!

56:14.872 --> 56:16.246
- I didn't dump you.

56:16.290 --> 56:18.165
I was freaking out
about the show.

56:18.209 --> 56:19.541
I made a couple mistakes

56:19.585 --> 56:23.295
and I was just confused
about what that all meant.

56:23.339 --> 56:24.004
- Made a couple mistakes?

56:24.048 --> 56:26.006
- But that's over now.

56:26.050 --> 56:27.466
And I wanna fix things with you.

56:27.510 --> 56:28.592
- What mistakes?

56:28.636 --> 56:29.843
What's over?

56:31.514 --> 56:32.262
- It doesn't matter?

56:32.306 --> 56:33.138
- I think it does.

56:33.182 --> 56:34.556
- You're not listening to me.

56:34.600 --> 56:36.934
I messed up and I
wanna fix things.

56:36.977 --> 56:38.519
I wanna make things
right with you.

56:38.562 --> 56:39.686
- You need to leave.

56:39.730 --> 56:41.563
- Not until you say
you're coming with me.

56:41.607 --> 56:43.232
- I'm not gonna do that, Derek.

56:43.275 --> 56:45.776
- Baby, I drove all the
way out here because

56:45.820 --> 56:49.905
I wanted to tell you that I--
- What's going on here?

56:51.617 --> 56:52.366
- Who are you?

56:55.371 --> 56:55.994
- Lucas meet Derek.

56:56.038 --> 56:58.997
Derek this is Lucas.

56:59.041 --> 57:00.082
Derek was just leaving.

57:03.170 --> 57:03.919
- So you're the
other car outside?

57:07.967 --> 57:10.050
Wait are you two--
- Derek, you can't be here.

57:12.304 --> 57:13.512
- I asked you a question.

57:16.058 --> 57:17.516
Here I am feeling all
terrible about what I've done,

57:17.560 --> 57:20.018
and you're out here banging
some backwards rando.

57:22.440 --> 57:22.980
Where'd you even find this guy?

57:25.985 --> 57:27.776
Hang on.

57:29.321 --> 57:30.529
Don't I know you?

57:30.573 --> 57:31.989
- You can't be here, Derek.

57:32.032 --> 57:33.323
- Lucas, you said.

57:35.619 --> 57:36.910
No, that's not right.

57:39.457 --> 57:40.873
You're sleeping with my girl?

57:42.585 --> 57:43.709
- She's not your girl.

57:43.752 --> 57:44.585
- Guys.

57:45.254 --> 57:47.212
You really need to go Derek.

57:47.256 --> 57:50.674
If you wait much longer, you're
gonna be late for your show.

57:53.179 --> 57:55.679
- So it's gonna
be like that, huh?

58:00.561 --> 58:02.644
She's all yours pal.

58:02.688 --> 58:04.521
Even with the pictures,
it wasn't worth it.

58:12.114 --> 58:15.365
She was a better lay
than you'll ever be.

58:36.347 --> 58:37.221
Stupid waste of time.

58:44.021 --> 58:46.772
(car tires screeching)

58:46.815 --> 58:49.399
(train honks)

58:49.443 --> 58:50.484
Oh, son of a!

58:51.278 --> 58:54.613
(tense music)

59:07.169 --> 59:10.170
(Amy knocks)
(Tara sobbing)

59:10.214 --> 59:11.505
- Knock, knock.

59:32.111 --> 59:34.236
- I'm guessing you
heard all that.

59:34.280 --> 59:35.070
- Yeah.

59:36.782 --> 59:39.783
- He was cheating on
me the whole time, Amy.

59:40.661 --> 59:43.787
(Tara sobs)

59:43.998 --> 59:46.498
- I'm such an idiot.
- No.

59:46.542 --> 59:47.082
You're not an idiot.

59:47.126 --> 59:48.292
Come here, oh.

59:49.253 --> 59:52.921
(poignant music)

1:00:16.363 --> 1:00:18.196
(ominous music)

1:00:48.437 --> 1:00:50.979
- Well, I knew I recognized
you from somewhere.

1:00:51.023 --> 1:00:52.147
So is that how long
this has been going on?

1:00:52.191 --> 1:00:54.816
- I have no idea what
you're talking about.

1:00:54.860 --> 1:00:57.778
- No, I knew it was you
from the destiny party.

1:00:57.821 --> 1:00:59.529
What was that about a
year and a half ago.

1:01:00.658 --> 1:01:02.366
You've been screwing
her all this time?

1:01:04.536 --> 1:01:06.453
That lying bitch!

1:01:06.497 --> 1:01:07.245
Tara!

1:01:07.289 --> 1:01:09.456
(tense music)

1:01:29.395 --> 1:01:31.853
(birds cawing)

1:01:43.909 --> 1:01:46.785
- There you are.
- Hey.

1:01:46.829 --> 1:01:50.038
Sorry, I just had to
throw something in my car.

1:01:50.082 --> 1:01:51.373
Is she okay?

1:01:53.043 --> 1:01:53.917
- She'll be fine.

1:01:55.254 --> 1:01:59.339
She and Derek just had
this connection, I guess.

1:02:00.843 --> 1:02:02.426
They'll be doing
this song and dance

1:02:02.469 --> 1:02:04.428
for a very long time, I think.

1:02:08.183 --> 1:02:09.766
- It seemed pretty over to me.

1:02:11.019 --> 1:02:11.059
- How cute.

1:02:13.313 --> 1:02:14.271
Wishful thinking.

1:02:16.108 --> 1:02:18.108
I'm gonna get a drink.

1:02:18.152 --> 1:02:19.067
You want one?

1:02:37.963 --> 1:02:41.214
(Tara exhales)

1:02:41.258 --> 1:02:42.382
- Hey guys, Tara here.

1:02:42.426 --> 1:02:45.927
It's now day two of
working in paradise.

1:02:45.971 --> 1:02:47.304
Some technical difficulties

1:02:47.347 --> 1:02:49.139
led to me losing
yesterday's vlog.

1:02:49.183 --> 1:02:50.265
Bummer, I know,

1:02:50.309 --> 1:02:51.558
but I'm very excited
to share with you

1:02:51.602 --> 1:02:54.561
some pictures I took using
this portraiture lens.

1:02:54.605 --> 1:02:57.147
(ominous music)

1:03:00.736 --> 1:03:01.568
Shoot!

1:03:29.973 --> 1:03:34.559
♪ Burn, burn, burn ♪

1:03:34.603 --> 1:03:38.271

1:03:38.315 --> 1:03:40.607

1:04:01.421 --> 1:04:03.129
- Idiot, Tara.

1:04:07.094 --> 1:04:10.971
(waves lapping)

1:04:11.056 --> 1:04:12.472
(Tara gasps)

1:04:12.516 --> 1:04:13.598
(tense music)

1:04:13.642 --> 1:04:14.015
John!

1:04:16.019 --> 1:04:17.602
He died, Amy

1:04:17.646 --> 1:04:17.686
Ten years ago

1:04:19.147 --> 1:04:20.355
(waves lapping)

1:04:20.399 --> 1:04:24.067
You're such an idiot.
Mom and Dad know it too.

1:04:26.572 --> 1:04:30.407
You're never going to be
able to move forward until

1:04:30.450 --> 1:05:06.401
you let go of your past.

1:05:06.445 --> 1:05:07.986
(insects chirping)

1:05:08.030 --> 1:05:10.363
(door creaks)

1:05:42.773 --> 1:05:43.438
Amy.

1:05:47.653 --> 1:05:48.902
- No Tara, wait.

1:05:50.447 --> 1:05:51.237
Tara.

1:05:53.367 --> 1:05:56.409
Tara, it was an accident.
- An accident?

1:05:56.453 --> 1:05:57.494
- You know I would never
do anything to hurt you.

1:05:57.537 --> 1:05:59.579
- Oh, yeah, you
wouldn't do anything.

1:05:59.623 --> 1:06:02.207
Nothing is ever
your doing, is it?

1:06:02.250 --> 1:06:03.416
Unless, of course it's something

1:06:03.460 --> 1:06:04.793
that I need to thank you for,

1:06:04.836 --> 1:06:07.879
something amazing, like
you bringing poor, broke,

1:06:07.923 --> 1:06:10.465
inadequate,
heartbroken little me

1:06:10.509 --> 1:06:12.509
out to one of your family's
incredible properties

1:06:12.552 --> 1:06:13.927
so we can have a girls' getaway

1:06:13.971 --> 1:06:15.220
that's supposedly
all for my benefit,

1:06:15.263 --> 1:06:18.098
where you tell me to
go for it with a guy.

1:06:18.141 --> 1:06:19.474
But what you really mean is

1:06:19.518 --> 1:06:22.143
how dare I ever think he
would choose me over you!

1:06:24.314 --> 1:06:27.357
You're sad, Amy.

1:06:27.442 --> 1:06:30.819
All you are is a needy,
empty, selfish, spoiled brat

1:06:30.862 --> 1:06:31.611
who would stab a
friend in the back

1:06:31.655 --> 1:06:32.487
the first chance she gets.

1:06:32.531 --> 1:06:34.572
- Yeah, okay, play the victim.

1:06:34.616 --> 1:06:37.200
Oh, poor Tara.

1:06:37.244 --> 1:06:39.077
Oh, I'm so responsible.

1:06:39.121 --> 1:06:40.954
I work so hard.

1:06:40.998 --> 1:06:42.747
I think I'm so much
better than everybody else

1:06:42.791 --> 1:06:45.375
because my family has no
money and my parents hate me.

1:06:45.419 --> 1:06:47.210
And, oo, I wanna be a
famous photographer,

1:06:47.254 --> 1:06:50.046
and my life is terrible.

1:06:50.090 --> 1:06:51.214
- Screw you, Amy.

1:06:51.258 --> 1:06:53.425
Oh, wait, Lucas
already did that.

1:06:53.468 --> 1:06:55.719
- That's what this is about?

1:06:55.762 --> 1:06:57.345
It's just sex, Tara.

1:06:57.389 --> 1:07:00.140
Maybe if you weren't such a
prude somebody would do you.

1:07:00.183 --> 1:07:01.683
- Shut up.
- Maybe that's the reason

1:07:01.727 --> 1:07:04.269
your boyfriend was so eager
to get in bed with me too.

1:07:06.398 --> 1:07:07.188
- What?

1:07:09.901 --> 1:07:12.360
- Nobody likes a
sob story, Tara.

1:07:12.404 --> 1:07:14.904
Your life is no more
difficult than anybody else's.

1:07:14.948 --> 1:07:16.322
You're just too
scared to admit that

1:07:16.366 --> 1:07:19.075
maybe it's you who's
not measuring up.

1:07:21.413 --> 1:07:24.664
Maybe it was the wrong
sibling that drowned that day.

1:07:31.923 --> 1:07:32.672
- We're done.

1:07:33.633 --> 1:07:36.426
I never wanna see or
hear from you ever again.

1:07:54.404 --> 1:07:56.654
(insects chirping)

1:08:14.758 --> 1:08:17.926
(car engine stuttering)

1:08:17.969 --> 1:08:20.512
(ominous music)

1:08:34.528 --> 1:08:36.486
- Let me take a look.
- Get away from me.

1:08:36.530 --> 1:08:38.863
- Let me just take a quick--
- Stay away.

1:08:38.907 --> 1:08:39.364
- I'm only trying to help.

1:08:39.407 --> 1:08:41.199
- Tara.

1:08:41.243 --> 1:08:43.201
Tara, I'm so, so sorry.
- Stop talking.

1:08:43.245 --> 1:08:45.870
- I don't know why I
said that, it was stupid.

1:08:45.914 --> 1:08:46.663
- Just stay away
from me both of you.

1:08:46.706 --> 1:08:48.706
- Can we just please talk?

1:08:48.750 --> 1:08:51.084
- I'm getting out
of here right now.

1:08:51.128 --> 1:08:53.253
Take me to town,
I'm gonna get a bus.

1:08:53.296 --> 1:08:54.420
It's too late.

1:08:54.464 --> 1:08:56.589
There's not gonna be a
bus until the morning.

1:08:58.218 --> 1:08:59.968
- You did this to my car.
- Me?

1:09:00.011 --> 1:09:01.177
You saw me fix it.

1:09:01.221 --> 1:09:03.596
- What are you playing at?
- You're upset,

1:09:03.640 --> 1:09:05.431
and that is totally
understandable,

1:09:05.475 --> 1:09:06.391
but it is very late, and--

1:09:06.434 --> 1:09:09.102
- Why did you do this to my car?

1:09:09.729 --> 1:09:12.939
- You don't think that maybe
it was your pissed off ex?

1:09:14.484 --> 1:09:16.651
- He has a point, Tara.

1:09:17.946 --> 1:09:19.279
- I would never--
- Can I just say one thing.

1:09:21.575 --> 1:09:24.159
Things got ugly in
there and I'm sorry.

1:09:24.202 --> 1:09:25.952
I really, really am.

1:09:25.996 --> 1:09:28.288
I didn't mean what I said and
I know I can't take it back

1:09:28.331 --> 1:09:32.125
but if we could just go back
inside and sleep it off,

1:09:32.169 --> 1:09:33.251
Lucas can bring us into
town in the morning.

1:09:35.463 --> 1:09:37.589
Don't you think that
makes the most sense?

1:09:40.802 --> 1:09:40.842
Tara, please!

1:10:12.542 --> 1:10:14.709
Tara, I'm really, really sorry.

1:10:20.133 --> 1:10:22.133
I'll see you in the morning.

1:10:24.930 --> 1:10:27.138
(Tara sighs)

1:10:38.652 --> 1:10:40.026
- It's not what you think.

1:10:40.070 --> 1:10:40.109
- Just go.

1:10:43.531 --> 1:10:45.365
(sad music)

1:11:07.055 --> 1:11:10.598
(ominous music)

1:11:39.212 --> 1:11:42.338
(Velcro rips)

1:13:06.341 --> 1:13:09.509
(tense music)

1:13:09.552 --> 1:13:12.136
(camera beeping)

1:13:33.868 --> 1:13:36.285
(keys clattering)

1:13:36.329 --> 1:13:38.788
(Tara gasps)

1:14:27.297 --> 1:14:31.215
(mysterious music)

1:15:21.935 --> 1:15:23.434
- Oh, it's okay, it's okay.

1:15:23.478 --> 1:15:25.102
Please, don't be scared, Tara.

1:15:26.022 --> 1:15:26.437
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1:15:28.816 --> 1:15:30.858
I would never do
anything to hurt you.

1:15:34.531 --> 1:15:36.697
He wasn't a good guy.

1:15:39.410 --> 1:15:40.535
He was using you,

1:15:40.578 --> 1:15:42.286
and he was sleeping
with your best friend,

1:15:43.831 --> 1:15:44.330
among others.

1:15:47.877 --> 1:15:48.918
He didn't come close
to treating you

1:15:48.962 --> 1:15:50.711
the way that you
deserve to be treated.

1:15:52.632 --> 1:15:55.049
Now, you finding me with Amy
was not part of the plan.

1:15:55.093 --> 1:15:58.052
You just got back home a little
bit sooner than I'd hoped.

1:16:00.223 --> 1:16:02.139
If you had just given
me a bit more time,

1:16:04.435 --> 1:16:05.434
I would've been able
to get rid of her too.

1:16:07.355 --> 1:16:09.021
You're the only
woman for me, Tara.

1:16:09.607 --> 1:16:13.025
You have always been
the only one for me.

1:16:14.112 --> 1:16:14.860
(Tara grunts)

1:16:14.904 --> 1:16:17.071
(Tara panting)

1:16:17.115 --> 1:16:17.905
Tara!

1:16:25.748 --> 1:16:27.248
Where are you running, Tara?

1:16:28.710 --> 1:16:31.627
I found you before and
I will find you again.

1:16:33.172 --> 1:16:34.297
I will always...

1:16:36.092 --> 1:16:36.841
find you.

1:16:44.601 --> 1:16:46.392
(Tara gasps)

1:16:46.436 --> 1:16:50.354
(Tara groans)

1:16:50.398 --> 1:16:53.024
(Tara groans)

1:16:54.694 --> 1:16:57.278
(Tara grunts)

1:16:58.656 --> 1:17:02.116
(Tara sobbing)

1:17:16.966 --> 1:17:18.716
(water gushing)

1:17:23.431 --> 1:17:23.471
- Tara!

1:17:28.478 --> 1:17:30.186
- She was a better lay
than you'll ever be.

1:17:30.229 --> 1:17:31.312
- [Amy Voiceover] Maybe
it was the wrong sibling

1:17:31.356 --> 1:17:33.064
that drowned that day.

1:17:43.242 --> 1:17:44.992
- You waking up there?

1:17:48.289 --> 1:17:49.288
I tried to be gentle.

1:17:51.751 --> 1:17:52.875
I'm sorry, but you
made me do that.

1:17:56.130 --> 1:17:59.548
You know I would never wanna
do anything to hurt you.

1:18:01.511 --> 1:18:03.052
I gave you a sedative
for the pain,

1:18:03.096 --> 1:18:04.345
I hope that's okay.

1:18:05.598 --> 1:18:06.931
We're off soon, but
you have to promise me,

1:18:09.811 --> 1:18:11.310
don't do anything stupid.

1:18:13.981 --> 1:18:14.814
I don't have to tie
you up like her.

1:18:16.818 --> 1:18:21.737
- Where is she?
(Lucas shushes)

1:18:21.781 --> 1:18:23.739
- We were doing so well.

1:18:24.867 --> 1:18:28.452
We finally had our
moment at the lake.

1:18:28.496 --> 1:18:28.869
That connection.

1:18:31.249 --> 1:18:31.872
That's why I knew it was time...

1:18:35.128 --> 1:18:35.835
Time to take care of Amy.

1:18:38.297 --> 1:18:39.088
Derek.

1:18:40.508 --> 1:18:41.924
Derek was not part of the plan.

1:18:41.968 --> 1:18:45.010
I was surprised
when he showed up.

1:18:45.054 --> 1:18:47.096
I figured I could
deal with him later.

1:18:47.140 --> 1:18:49.682
And then when he
decided to come back,

1:18:50.643 --> 1:18:51.600
I couldn't have that.

1:18:52.979 --> 1:18:55.730
I had to protect you.

1:18:58.276 --> 1:18:59.567
- What do you want from us?

1:19:01.487 --> 1:19:01.944
- Us?

1:19:03.906 --> 1:19:07.450
How many times do
I have to tell you?

1:19:07.493 --> 1:19:08.492
There's only you.

1:19:09.620 --> 1:19:11.370
It's always only been you.

1:19:14.459 --> 1:19:16.709
Love at first sight.

1:19:16.753 --> 1:19:17.501
It's real.

1:19:19.046 --> 1:19:22.047
- You can't love someone
after two days, Lucas.

1:19:24.343 --> 1:19:25.134
- Oh no.

1:19:26.679 --> 1:19:28.846
No, I have been in
love with you for years

1:19:30.850 --> 1:19:32.057
since sixth grade

1:19:33.478 --> 1:19:35.436
when you rescued me.

1:19:35.480 --> 1:19:36.854
Those boys were harassing me

1:19:36.898 --> 1:19:38.564
and you told them
to leave me alone.

1:19:39.817 --> 1:19:41.901
And then you reached out your
hand and you helped me up.

1:19:47.450 --> 1:19:48.240
- Brian?

1:19:50.661 --> 1:19:51.994
- I knew you would remember me.

1:19:53.790 --> 1:19:55.915
I found my middle
name suited me better.

1:19:55.958 --> 1:19:55.998
Anyway.

1:20:00.546 --> 1:20:01.587
I know it now,

1:20:02.131 --> 1:20:04.089
just like I knew it then,

1:20:06.552 --> 1:20:08.385
I would do anything for you.

1:20:11.057 --> 1:20:12.014
I lost you for a
little while there...

1:20:16.646 --> 1:20:18.854
after I took your brother
out of the picture.

1:20:20.274 --> 1:20:22.358
He was such a
terrible bully to you.

1:20:24.195 --> 1:20:26.529
And I will never forget
the look in his eyes

1:20:26.572 --> 1:20:27.988
the moment before
he hit the water.

1:20:31.577 --> 1:20:35.079
And things didn't go
as planned after that.

1:20:35.122 --> 1:20:35.996
You disappeared.

1:20:36.040 --> 1:20:37.164
I had no way of finding you.

1:20:37.208 --> 1:20:39.500
I thought he was over for us.

1:20:41.295 --> 1:20:43.295
So you can only
imagine my surprise

1:20:43.339 --> 1:20:44.421
when I'm researching
camera equipment

1:20:44.465 --> 1:20:47.132
and suddenly your
beautiful face pops up

1:20:47.176 --> 1:20:49.260
telling me all about it.

1:20:50.012 --> 1:20:51.053
It's fate.

1:20:53.724 --> 1:20:55.975
You can't ignore that Tara.

1:20:56.018 --> 1:20:57.226
So I dropped everything

1:20:57.270 --> 1:20:59.144
and I moved out here
to be close to you.

1:20:59.188 --> 1:21:01.272
And I've been following
your life ever since,

1:21:01.315 --> 1:21:03.732
just waiting for
the perfect moment.

1:21:03.776 --> 1:21:06.235
No, the pieces, they
just fell into place.

1:21:06.279 --> 1:21:09.947
I just, I knew that
this would be my chance,

1:21:11.909 --> 1:21:14.577
my chance to finally show
you who really loves you.

1:21:16.205 --> 1:21:18.706
I had to take care
of those that don't.

1:21:23.170 --> 1:21:23.210
You're ready.

1:21:30.052 --> 1:21:33.554
(water lapping)

1:21:35.224 --> 1:21:37.099
(fire crackling)

1:21:38.060 --> 1:21:39.852
- Oh, no.

1:21:42.773 --> 1:21:45.107
(Amy sobbing)

1:21:48.487 --> 1:21:51.780
(Amy groaning)

1:21:51.824 --> 1:21:52.615
- Shh!

1:21:55.828 --> 1:21:55.993
- Stop!
- What?

1:21:58.581 --> 1:22:01.665
Why are you still defending
this ungrateful, spoiled whore.

1:22:01.709 --> 1:22:03.083
She has done nothing
but betray you.

1:22:05.838 --> 1:22:06.503
Nothing!

1:22:14.138 --> 1:22:15.429
- You're right.

1:22:16.432 --> 1:22:18.724
She is an ungrateful,
spoiled whore.

1:22:25.524 --> 1:22:26.106
You helped me see that, Lucas.

1:22:28.402 --> 1:22:29.193
I had no idea that
there could be

1:22:29.236 --> 1:22:31.320
someone out there like you,

1:22:32.490 --> 1:22:33.906
someone who really listens,

1:22:34.992 --> 1:22:35.157
really understands,

1:22:37.411 --> 1:22:39.495
who takes actions to
protect those he loves.

1:22:42.083 --> 1:22:43.165
And it's made me realize...

1:22:45.294 --> 1:22:46.126
I hate her.

1:22:49.465 --> 1:22:52.341
As long as I've known you,
I've been there for you.

1:22:52.385 --> 1:22:54.593
I've gone where you wanted,
driven where you wanted,

1:22:54.637 --> 1:22:56.095
dressed how you want.

1:22:56.138 --> 1:22:58.263
Put my life on hold

1:22:58.307 --> 1:23:01.266
because something on your agenda
was always more important.

1:23:01.310 --> 1:23:03.686
And for what?

1:23:03.729 --> 1:23:05.980
So you could tease
me for being broke,

1:23:06.023 --> 1:23:08.774
insult my career, sleep
with my boyfriend?

1:23:10.528 --> 1:23:13.988
Why do you even claim
to want to be my friend?

1:23:14.031 --> 1:23:15.781
Is it an ego boost?

1:23:15.825 --> 1:23:17.992
Does putting me down
make you feel better

1:23:18.035 --> 1:23:19.243
about your pathetic life?

1:23:23.332 --> 1:23:24.081
Let me do it.

1:23:31.215 --> 1:23:34.383
- I wouldn't want your
hands to get dirty, my love.

1:23:34.427 --> 1:23:37.886
- You've been protecting
me my whole life.

1:23:44.103 --> 1:23:45.686
My brother was awful.

1:23:47.398 --> 1:23:48.188
- Yes.

1:23:49.400 --> 1:23:50.357
- He was a monster.

1:23:51.402 --> 1:23:52.192
- Yes.

1:23:53.821 --> 1:23:55.404
- He made my life miserable,

1:23:59.118 --> 1:24:00.284
and my parents miserable too.

1:24:02.580 --> 1:24:03.912
When he died...

1:24:06.042 --> 1:24:09.209
When he died, I felt
like I was living a lie,

1:24:10.755 --> 1:24:12.337
pretending along with my parents

1:24:12.381 --> 1:24:14.381
like he was such a
wonderful brother,

1:24:15.468 --> 1:24:17.551
that he wasn't actually
my worst nightmare.

1:24:22.975 --> 1:24:24.183
Why do we suddenly paint someone

1:24:24.226 --> 1:24:25.934
in a different light
when they're gone?

1:24:27.772 --> 1:24:28.270
My parents were destroyed.

1:24:31.108 --> 1:24:34.860
It was like they didn't
have room for me anymore.

1:24:34.904 --> 1:24:36.070
Even in death,

1:24:37.031 --> 1:24:39.031
he still somehow tortured me.

1:24:41.327 --> 1:24:42.242
I'm glad he's gone.

1:24:45.539 --> 1:24:47.790
I can't pretend any longer.

1:24:47.833 --> 1:24:49.875
Sometimes our lives
are just better

1:24:49.919 --> 1:24:53.045
without those who would
otherwise bring us down.

1:24:53.089 --> 1:24:55.422
(tense music)

1:24:58.344 --> 1:24:59.176
You've taken care
of me long enough.

1:25:00.262 --> 1:25:03.263
Let me do this for myself.

1:25:06.769 --> 1:25:08.435
I'm sorry it had to
be this way, Amy.

1:25:10.773 --> 1:25:11.605
But you were right,

1:25:13.150 --> 1:25:14.149
I'm not gonna get anywhere

1:25:14.193 --> 1:25:15.692
if I continue to
live in the past.

1:25:16.320 --> 1:25:19.655
(Amy moaning)

1:25:26.664 --> 1:25:27.704
Thank you, Lucas.

1:25:36.423 --> 1:25:39.842
(Lucas groans)

1:25:44.431 --> 1:25:48.100
(water splashes)

1:25:49.687 --> 1:25:52.187
(Tara gasps)

1:25:53.566 --> 1:25:55.607
(both groaning)

1:25:55.651 --> 1:25:56.400
- Let's go.

1:25:56.443 --> 1:25:57.818
Hurry, let's go.

1:26:14.753 --> 1:26:16.545
(Amy screams)

1:26:16.589 --> 1:26:18.422
- Oh my god!

1:26:18.465 --> 1:26:19.381
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1:26:19.425 --> 1:26:21.550
- Amy, we have to get him out.

1:26:21.594 --> 1:26:23.969
Just (groans), no, we can do it.

1:26:24.013 --> 1:26:24.803
Help me Amy.

1:26:24.847 --> 1:26:29.391
(Amy screams)
(Tara groans)

1:26:40.279 --> 1:26:41.904
No.

1:26:41.947 --> 1:26:43.363
Do you know how to drive stick?

1:26:43.407 --> 1:26:44.781
- No, don't you?

1:26:48.329 --> 1:26:49.036
(Tara groans)

1:26:49.079 --> 1:26:52.789
(car engine turning over)

1:26:53.751 --> 1:26:54.333
(car engine turning over)

1:26:54.376 --> 1:26:55.500
- Okay, okay.

1:26:56.587 --> 1:26:59.922
(Tara grunts)

1:27:02.593 --> 1:27:04.760
(car engine turning over)

1:27:04.803 --> 1:27:07.554
(tense music)

1:27:07.598 --> 1:27:10.515
(engine revving)

1:27:10.559 --> 1:27:12.184
- This can't be happening.

1:27:12.228 --> 1:27:13.518
- Hurry.

1:27:13.562 --> 1:27:15.896
Hurry Amy.
- You drive.

1:27:15.940 --> 1:27:18.774
- You have to, you have
to do this one thing.

1:27:18.817 --> 1:27:20.317
Just do it.
- I'm trying.

1:27:20.361 --> 1:27:21.777
- Tara.

1:27:21.820 --> 1:27:23.612
Please don't do
this to me again.

1:27:25.032 --> 1:27:27.366
I will always find you.

1:27:27.409 --> 1:27:28.825
I love you!

1:27:28.869 --> 1:27:29.826
(Lucas screams)

1:27:29.870 --> 1:27:32.746
(Amy screams)

1:27:32.790 --> 1:27:34.498
(both panting)

1:27:54.770 --> 1:27:56.603
- All right, this
is the last one.

1:27:58.482 --> 1:28:00.607
- Thank you.
- No prob.

1:28:01.485 --> 1:28:04.069
- Well, that's it.

1:28:04.113 --> 1:28:05.612
My whole life
packed into one car.

1:28:06.657 --> 1:28:07.447
- That's not true.

1:28:07.491 --> 1:28:09.741
I'm not in there.

1:28:09.785 --> 1:28:12.911
(both chuckle)

1:28:12.997 --> 1:28:13.745
Hey.

1:28:14.873 --> 1:28:16.790
I'm proud of you.

1:28:16.834 --> 1:28:17.916
I really am.

1:28:17.960 --> 1:28:20.502
(calm music)

1:28:20.546 --> 1:28:20.585
- You know what?

1:28:22.756 --> 1:28:23.714
I'm proud of you too.

1:28:25.259 --> 1:28:26.800
- We'll see.

1:28:26.844 --> 1:28:28.593
Next time we talk, I might
be living on the streets.

1:28:28.637 --> 1:28:31.388
- You know that
will never happen.

1:28:31.432 --> 1:28:32.973
You'll always have
a place with me.

1:28:35.311 --> 1:28:38.145
- And where's that
gonna be exactly?

1:28:38.188 --> 1:28:41.481
- I mean, we'll see how
things go with the parents.

1:28:41.525 --> 1:28:43.608
I'm just trying to
keep an open mind

1:28:43.652 --> 1:28:45.110
and seeing where it leads me.

1:28:46.655 --> 1:28:48.238
- Well,

1:28:48.282 --> 1:28:52.451
you be sure to call me

1:28:52.494 --> 1:28:54.619
the second that you arrive.

1:28:54.663 --> 1:28:55.454
Okay?

1:28:57.249 --> 1:28:59.624
I hear there are some
crazies around these parts.

1:28:59.668 --> 1:29:01.585
(both chuckle)

1:29:01.628 --> 1:29:04.004
- I'll call you
when I get there,

1:29:04.048 --> 1:29:06.506
unless you call me first.
- Oh, you know me so well.

1:29:21.523 --> 1:29:24.649
(Amy sighs)

1:29:26.528 --> 1:29:28.278
- Got it.

1:29:47.716 --> 1:29:49.549
- Here we go.
