What worked?

14:16.523 --> 14:18.980
I brought you here
with music.

I just had
to think of you,
and it worked.

Please, come in.

14:26.408 --> 14:28.364
I met an unusual man,

14:28.452 --> 14:33.663

to my ability, using this.

get this cello?

with this.

good years, growing up.

called my father "Sir."

he moved on with his.

15:39.189 --> 15:40.349
But he hadn't.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.056
He showed up
in my room one night,

of crazy things.

16:27.821 --> 16:28.936

I would choose,
but he does seem...

16:33.869 --> 16:35.234
Obsessed?

16:37.455 --> 16:42.119
A week ago, he was waiting
for me in the lobby
of my apartment building,

16:42.460 --> 16:45.122
going on and on
about how much
he misses me,

16:45.213 --> 16:49.252

powerful he's become.

and you know how to reach him?

my head against the wall

16:59.603 --> 17:01.309

how to find the carnival,

17:01.396 --> 17:04.263

the carnival to us.

was William Hooper.

he want from you?

He didn't want anything.

Yes.

If there's any
connection to that,

I'd keep my distance
from him.

Hi.

30:20.945 --> 30:22.981
(SHRIEKS)
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.

30:23.072 --> 30:24.983
What is wrong with you?
Let me explain.

30:25.074 --> 30:28.942
l have these dreams that
come true and I had one
about you and that cello.

30:29.036 --> 30:31.152
You broke my cello
because you had a dream?

30:31.247 --> 30:33.329
No, because a lot of people
are gonna die, Emma.

30:33.416 --> 30:37.000
Your friend, Samuel,
that compass that
you have, my tattoo,

30:37.086 --> 30:38.792
they're all connected
to this cello.

30:38.879 --> 30:39.959
Not the cello!

30:40.047 --> 30:42.288
And we have to make sure
to stop that dream
from happening.

30:42.383 --> 30:43.793
That's why I broke
the cello, okay?

30:43.884 --> 30:46.091
Something bad
is going to happen.

30:46.178 --> 30:47.964
I want you out.

30:50.516 --> 30:51.722
Now!

30:59.150 --> 31:00.890
I'm sorry.

31:04.447 --> 31:06.153

31:30.848 --> 31:34.011
We must away,
before the storm troopers
are upon us.

31:34.143 --> 31:36.384
l have had just about enough
of your nonsense, Hiro.

31:36.479 --> 31:37.514
After what you did to me,

31:37.605 --> 31:39.436
l have half a mind
to leave you lost
in this swamp forever.

31:39.523 --> 31:41.605
Hey. Don't talk
to him like that.

31:41.692 --> 31:44.900
Hiro's got very little time
left and he chose to
spend it rescuing you.

31:44.987 --> 31:46.727
You should be thankful.
He's a hero.

31:46.822 --> 31:48.687
What do you mean
"little time"?

31:48.824 --> 31:50.325

for no man.

(CHATTERING ON RADIO)

32:22.441 --> 32:24.147
Are you sure
he can't teleport?

32:24.235 --> 32:27.022
No. Not unless
we unscramble his brain.

32:27.196 --> 32:28.857
Hey, what would
they have done
at that hospital?

32:28.948 --> 32:30.529
Probably
electroshock therapy.

32:31.700 --> 32:32.951
Hiro.

32:34.203 --> 32:35.238
Why are we stopping?

32:35.329 --> 32:36.944
Electroshock therapy.

32:37.039 --> 32:38.620
What? You want me...
Even ifwe evade them,

32:38.707 --> 32:42.040
we could be wandering
out here for days. We need
to teleport out of here.

32:42.253 --> 32:45.245
How?
You can use
your red lightning.

32:45.589 --> 32:49.332
Look, Hiro once saw
a future where I killed him
with my red lightning.

32:49.426 --> 32:51.587
Was it in Florida?
Japan.

32:51.720 --> 32:53.631
Then we're good to go.

32:56.892 --> 32:58.803

Hey.

33:43.147 --> 33:45.980
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was just
in the neighborhood.

33:46.108 --> 33:47.314
Really?

33:47.818 --> 33:52.983
No. No. lwas in California.
I just landed,
bags are still in the car.

Listen, I know
that you're mad at me
and I'm okay with that.

33:56.660 --> 33:59.197
And lwanna just
let you be mad at me.

33:59.288 --> 34:01.119
I don't wanna try to
talk you out of anything

34:01.207 --> 34:02.492
or to try to convince you
of anything...

34:02.583 --> 34:05.165
Dad, what are you
doing here?

34:08.422 --> 34:09.662
Are you all right?

34:09.798 --> 34:12.756
Yeah. Yeah. I'm good.
I'm great, actually.

34:13.135 --> 34:14.636
I'm just...

34:15.262 --> 34:17.253
I've been thinking
about bridges.

34:17.348 --> 34:18.679
BHdges?

34:18.807 --> 34:24.643
Bridges that connect us
to the people
and things that we love

34:24.772 --> 34:28.356
and need in our lives
that are built on trust,
and I've...

34:29.485 --> 34:31.441
l've torched
most of them.

34:33.364 --> 34:37.698
And I'm just hoping
that the one
that connects me to you

34:39.703 --> 34:41.489
can still be repaired.

34:44.833 --> 34:49.202
I'm sorry, but
I do have something
that I'm late for.

34:50.339 --> 34:52.375
Oh. Okay.

34:52.508 --> 34:54.248
Can we talk
about this later?
Yeah. Yeah.

34:54.343 --> 34:56.208
We'll talk
about it later.

34:56.345 --> 34:58.085
This thing that
you're late for,
do you need a lift?

34:58.180 --> 34:59.340
No.

No, I'm good.

35:03.310 --> 35:04.516
Okay.

I'll see you later?
Yeah. I'll see you later.

I didn't think a law office
could be such a soap opera.

So how about you?
Did you leave the house
at all today?

Do you think
I'm a coward?

35:52.359 --> 35:53.769
What?

35:54.737 --> 35:56.693
I think I'm a coward.

35:56.780 --> 35:58.816
What are you
talking about? Why?

35:58.907 --> 36:01.649
I had the worst guy
in the world
living inside my head.

36:01.744 --> 36:05.202
When I finally got rid of him,
I didn't do a thing
to go after him.

home to us,

instead of facing the world,

about the problems
that I've caused.

anything you need...

to go home, Samuel.

for so long, Vanessa.

to be like this.

to be perfect.

you're talking about.

37:59.862 --> 38:03.446
He did a real number
on you, didn't he?
He got in your head.

38:03.532 --> 38:05.614
I had to act to protect you,
to get you away from him.

38:05.701 --> 38:07.407
By kidnapping me?

38:07.995 --> 38:09.360
I would hardly say that.

what would you call it?

You know what?
I'm just...

38:43.739 --> 38:45.229
You're upset.

38:45.824 --> 38:47.735
And I understand why.

38:48.827 --> 38:51.569
But there is a reason
for all of this.

I want you to see.

so beautiful.

I'll take you
right back to California.

"right back to California"?

than I want to admit.
