WEBVTT

00:17.284 --> 00:19.618
I shouldn't be doing this.

00:19.651 --> 00:22.484
A man of my talents shouldn't
be scavenging for food.

00:22.518 --> 00:25.084
We're not scavenging,
we're hunting.

00:25.118 --> 00:26.651
With that?

00:26.684 --> 00:29.151
What are you expecting
to find, a mouse?

00:29.184 --> 00:31.084
Maybe a small vole?

00:31.118 --> 00:32.451
Someone has to gut the thing,

00:32.484 --> 00:34.884
you can hardly do that
with your ridiculous stick.

00:34.918 --> 00:36.518
It is not a stick,
it's a spear.

00:36.551 --> 00:38.884
And I'll have you know,
with this very spear
I have defeated...

00:38.918 --> 00:39.918
Shh.

00:40.518 --> 00:41.518
(MEWLING)

00:54.618 --> 00:56.118
It's a baby.

00:58.684 --> 01:00.858
We need to find the mother,
she can't be far.

01:00.891 --> 01:02.224
-I don't think so.
-Spread out.

01:02.258 --> 01:03.891
Hercules, you go that way,

01:03.924 --> 01:04.991
and Pythagoras,
retrace our steps.

01:05.024 --> 01:06.224
She won't be here.

01:06.258 --> 01:07.657
What are you talking about?

01:07.691 --> 01:11.991
The child has been exposed,
it's been left here to die.

01:12.024 --> 01:14.624
That's insane!
Why would someone do that?

01:14.658 --> 01:18.924
There can be many reasons,
the child could be too weak
to survive.

01:18.958 --> 01:20.158
It looks fine.

01:20.191 --> 01:21.591
Or it could be born
out of wedlock...

01:21.624 --> 01:23.291
If we can't find the mother,
we need to help.

01:23.324 --> 01:26.891
No, we can't interfere!
This was the child's fate.

01:26.924 --> 01:28.558
Well, maybe it was my fate
to find it.

01:29.158 --> 01:31.224
He's got a point.

01:31.258 --> 01:33.724
Only a fool challenges
the Gods.

01:34.991 --> 01:36.324
You see? They have spoken.

01:36.358 --> 01:38.391
Nonsense, the poor thing
is just hungry.

01:38.424 --> 01:40.124
Join the club.

01:40.158 --> 01:42.158
Here, see if you can
calm it down.

01:42.191 --> 01:44.624
Me? What do I know
about babies?

01:44.658 --> 01:47.291
You must have been one once,
Pythagoras, think back.

01:47.324 --> 01:50.691
This is ridiculous,
we need to put it back.

01:53.158 --> 01:54.724
JASON: He's a natural.

01:54.758 --> 01:56.058
Maybe it's his fate.

01:56.091 --> 01:58.224
Got to be.

01:58.258 --> 02:01.431
We can't interfere.
I have got to...

02:04.531 --> 02:06.364
This is not fair.

02:06.398 --> 02:08.164
(BABY LAUGHING)

02:43.198 --> 02:45.598
A whole morning hunting

02:45.631 --> 02:49.231
and all we come back with
is one more mouth to feed.

02:50.131 --> 02:52.531
There must be some food
somewhere.

02:53.764 --> 02:55.231
-Is that you, Hercules?
-What?

02:55.264 --> 02:56.331
(EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST)

02:56.364 --> 02:58.098
-No!
-Definitely not one of yours?

02:58.131 --> 02:59.598
Why does it always have
to be me?

02:59.631 --> 03:01.338
A question we ask ourselves
every morning.

03:01.371 --> 03:04.271
No, it could just as easily
be either one of you two.

03:05.738 --> 03:07.171
I don't think so.

03:07.204 --> 03:10.604
Not me, I carried it
all the way back.

03:10.638 --> 03:13.271
No, no, I told you,
I know nothing about babies.

03:13.304 --> 03:15.604
I'd just drop it or something.

03:16.604 --> 03:20.204
Right. Get me a bowl
and some cloths.

03:30.238 --> 03:34.271
That solves one mystery,
it's definitely a boy.

03:34.304 --> 03:37.304
Tell me when it's all over.

03:50.904 --> 03:52.471
Aww.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.644
JASON:
How could anyone abandon him?

04:00.444 --> 04:01.944
He's perfect.

04:01.978 --> 04:04.211
Apart from the funny foot.

04:05.478 --> 04:07.278
JASON:
It's just swollen, that's all.

04:07.311 --> 04:08.211
(BABY CRYING)

04:08.244 --> 04:09.344
Shh. Now look
what you've done.

04:09.378 --> 04:11.811
Nothing to do with me,
he's hungry.

04:11.844 --> 04:14.244
And I know exactly
how he feels.

04:28.944 --> 04:31.044
-You look exhausted.
-Medusa!

04:31.078 --> 04:34.144
If you were going
to buy food for a child,
what would you buy?

04:34.177 --> 04:36.177
Sardines or olives?

04:36.211 --> 04:37.644
Depends. How old is the child?

04:37.677 --> 04:39.711
About that old.

04:39.744 --> 04:40.844
You're at the wrong stall.

04:40.878 --> 04:42.044
Really?

04:53.044 --> 04:54.078
Who was that?

04:54.111 --> 04:55.344
King Laius of Thebes.

04:55.378 --> 04:57.911
He's been the King's guest
for a few weeks now.

05:11.618 --> 05:13.418
You had a successful hunt,
My Lord?

05:13.451 --> 05:16.451
King Laius did,
all the trophies are his.

05:17.351 --> 05:19.751
I imagined that would
be the case.

05:19.784 --> 05:20.951
The Gods were generous.

05:21.384 --> 05:22.418
Indeed.

05:30.551 --> 05:32.551
The King is
an accomplished hunter.

05:32.584 --> 05:34.384
He is.

05:34.418 --> 05:37.718
A pity he doesn't
restrict his prowess
to the hunting grounds.

05:37.751 --> 05:40.584
King Laius is of royal blood,
you will speak of him
with respect.

05:40.618 --> 05:43.351
I wonder how the Queen
feels about his royal blood.

05:43.384 --> 05:46.651
She has barely looked at him
all the time she's been here.

05:46.684 --> 05:47.884
Have you not noticed?

05:48.684 --> 05:50.751
She is young and shy,

05:50.784 --> 05:53.618
it takes time to grow
into the role of Queen.

06:00.024 --> 06:01.858
Do we really need
all this stuff?

06:01.891 --> 06:03.358
I mean, he is just a baby.

06:03.391 --> 06:05.358
I assume you have
swaddling clothes?

06:05.391 --> 06:06.758
Yes. Of course.

06:06.791 --> 06:09.291
Wait... What are
swaddling clothes?

06:09.324 --> 06:10.724
Just to be sure.

06:10.758 --> 06:13.324
Poor thing, he'd probably
stand more chance
on the mountain

06:13.358 --> 06:14.824
than with you three.

06:24.924 --> 06:27.358
Keep it down!
I've only just got him off.

06:28.291 --> 06:29.258
Medusa!

06:29.291 --> 06:31.224
-I thought we were
keeping it down.
-Shh.

06:38.824 --> 06:40.191
This is wonderful.

06:40.224 --> 06:43.591
Sorry about the mess,
these two boys, you know...

06:43.624 --> 06:45.358
I'm the tidy one, actually!

06:45.391 --> 06:46.491
Is this him?

06:47.591 --> 06:49.324
Isn't he sweet?

06:49.358 --> 06:52.391
Can you believe someone just
abandoned him?

06:52.424 --> 06:55.924
I couldn't leave a baby out
on the side of a mountain,
now, could I?

06:55.958 --> 06:57.058
You brought him back?

06:57.091 --> 06:58.998
Carried him all the way home.

07:00.498 --> 07:01.564
MEDUSA: Hello.

07:01.598 --> 07:03.364
I bought some goat's milk.

07:03.398 --> 07:04.964
Fill that up.

07:07.164 --> 07:08.864
Yeah. Ooh.

07:09.564 --> 07:10.798
There was nothing on him?

07:10.831 --> 07:13.298
No note, no jewellry
to pay his way?

07:13.331 --> 07:16.398
Nothing. Whoever left him
clearly didn't want
to be found.

07:18.398 --> 07:19.564
Here.

07:19.598 --> 07:21.398
Oh, he must be starving.

07:21.431 --> 07:25.164
That's why I sent Jason out,
I knew the little fellow
would need something to eat.

07:25.198 --> 07:27.998
You're such
a kind-hearted man, Hercules.

07:28.031 --> 07:30.431
Maybe we should go back
to where we found him.

07:30.464 --> 07:31.764
Excellent idea.

07:31.798 --> 07:35.364
Why don't you take Pythagoras,
see what you can dig up?

07:35.398 --> 07:36.998
While you stay here
with the food?

07:37.031 --> 07:39.364
Like you said,
I'm good with babies.
You're not.

07:39.398 --> 07:40.498
It's just the way we are.

07:40.531 --> 07:42.298
-MEDUSA: He's drunk it all!
-(GROANS)

07:42.331 --> 07:43.598
Sweet!

07:43.631 --> 07:45.164
Is there any more?

07:45.198 --> 07:48.031
I'll get it. Then perhaps
you can show me how
to feed him?

07:48.064 --> 07:49.364
It's pathetic, it really is.

07:49.398 --> 07:52.231
Goodbye, Pythagoras.
Goodbye, goodbye.

07:59.198 --> 08:01.938
I know what he needs,
something to play with.

08:03.438 --> 08:05.904
You're blowing fumes
in his face!

08:19.504 --> 08:20.638
It's wind.

08:20.671 --> 08:22.571
Sorry, it must have crept out.

08:22.604 --> 08:23.671
(BABY BELCHES)

08:23.704 --> 08:24.904
There, there...

08:26.638 --> 08:27.971
That's better.

08:28.004 --> 08:31.704
He's settled down!
You're a genius.

08:37.004 --> 08:38.104
Yeah.

08:43.638 --> 08:46.104
He should sleep
for a while now.

08:46.138 --> 08:47.704
What about you, Medusa?

08:49.438 --> 08:51.938
I didn't mean... No.

08:51.971 --> 08:54.938
I meant, are you hungry?
Would you like something
to eat?

08:54.971 --> 08:56.804
Maybe a drink?
Perhaps some wine?

08:56.838 --> 08:58.404
At this time of day?

08:59.744 --> 09:01.111
It's after breakfast.

09:01.144 --> 09:02.311
I should go.

09:02.344 --> 09:04.078
No, please don't.

09:04.111 --> 09:06.878
Give him this
if he wakes, all right?

09:08.411 --> 09:09.811
Medusa...

09:12.778 --> 09:15.911
-Idiot, idiot, idiot!
-(BABY SQUALLS)

09:26.244 --> 09:31.478
You, your little face.
Do you want a bit more?

09:31.511 --> 09:36.111
Oh, you're a good boy,
aren't you? Yes, you are.

09:36.144 --> 09:38.178
Have you had enough?

09:38.211 --> 09:41.378
We've got Medusa
to thank for this, haven't we?

09:41.411 --> 09:44.178
Yes, we have.

09:44.211 --> 09:46.178
She's so beautiful.

09:46.211 --> 09:47.911
Yes, she is.

09:47.944 --> 09:51.644
She's the most
beautiful person
I've ever met.

09:51.678 --> 09:54.478
Apart from you, of course.

09:54.511 --> 09:58.644
Why can't I tell her
how I feel? Hmm?

09:58.678 --> 10:02.584
Because I'm old and fat,
and she wouldn't give me
a second glance,

10:02.618 --> 10:04.184
would she?

10:04.218 --> 10:06.451
She wouldn't, would she?

10:06.484 --> 10:09.151
Oh, those little
chubby cheeks.

10:09.184 --> 10:12.551
Yes, and a bit more?

10:12.584 --> 10:14.884
There we go.

10:15.418 --> 10:17.518
Good boy.

10:19.926 --> 10:22.359
There aren't even
any hoof prints.

10:22.393 --> 10:25.293
Whoever abandoned him
erased every trace.

10:25.326 --> 10:27.426
What must the mother have felt
when she left him?

10:27.459 --> 10:29.859
Walking away from
the baby she bore.

10:29.893 --> 10:31.793
No one would
do that willingly.

10:31.826 --> 10:33.226
Perhaps it wasn't her.

10:33.259 --> 10:37.259
To grow up
not knowing your mother,
nobody deserves that.

10:37.293 --> 10:40.993
Which is why we must do
our very best to help the boy.

10:54.159 --> 10:56.093
It's just a stone.

10:57.626 --> 10:59.393
That's not a stone.

11:00.926 --> 11:04.999
That's a shard.
A piece of pottery.

11:05.033 --> 11:07.033
And look, this must be
the grain that was inside it.

11:08.899 --> 11:12.666
If we find enough,
we might be able
to reconstruct some of it.

11:12.699 --> 11:14.266
Here.

11:28.966 --> 11:30.266
JASON: Hercules?

11:31.733 --> 11:33.466
Hercules!

11:42.566 --> 11:44.066
We bought some pies!

11:44.099 --> 11:46.366
Pie... What, where?
What's going on?

11:46.399 --> 11:48.099
Careful. Careful.

11:51.433 --> 11:52.633
Where's Medusa?

11:52.666 --> 11:55.633
Medusa? Oh, she had to go.

11:55.666 --> 11:58.999
You see, that's what happens
when you try to punch
above your weight.

11:59.033 --> 12:02.139
Which, let's face it,
in your case, is considerable.

12:02.173 --> 12:04.206
She had to go to work,
all right?

12:04.239 --> 12:08.106
Some of us take our
responsibilities seriously!

12:08.139 --> 12:10.239
I'm sure she'll be back.

12:10.273 --> 12:11.373
Do you think?

12:11.406 --> 12:12.439
Yeah.

12:24.373 --> 12:25.573
There!

12:29.406 --> 12:30.473
You sure that's right?

12:30.506 --> 12:31.573
Of course.

12:31.606 --> 12:34.106
You got it
the wrong way round?
Or upside down?

12:34.139 --> 12:35.939
What's wrong with you two?
Can't you see what it is?

12:36.806 --> 12:39.006
-A rock?
-A piece of mud?

12:40.573 --> 12:41.573
(OINKING)

12:42.739 --> 12:44.306
It's a pig!

12:44.339 --> 12:47.573
That's its back legs,
that's its front legs
and that's its snout.

12:47.606 --> 12:48.873
(OINKS)

12:48.906 --> 12:51.273
-Of course. A pig. Obviously.
-Yes, it's a pig.

12:51.306 --> 12:54.606
It was a child's rattle,
that's what the grain was for,
to make the noise.

12:54.639 --> 12:57.073
The mother didn't
leave it with nothing,
she did care.

12:57.106 --> 13:00.873
It's beautifully made,
look at the detailing
along its back.

13:00.906 --> 13:02.979
Still doesn't get us anywhere.

13:03.013 --> 13:04.013
(SIGHS)

13:05.013 --> 13:07.046
I'm not sure
we should get any further.

13:08.613 --> 13:11.279
The child's clearly
from a wealthy family.

13:11.313 --> 13:14.313
Whatever reason
they had to abandon him,

13:14.346 --> 13:17.946
one thing's for sure,
they don't want him found.

13:22.679 --> 13:26.379
Great Artemis,
Goddess of the hunt,
I make you this offering

13:26.413 --> 13:30.013
in thanks for the bounty
you bequeathed on us today.

13:39.479 --> 13:41.746
And now, my friends, enjoy!

13:56.946 --> 13:59.446
The Gods have surely
smiled upon you today,
My Lord.

13:59.479 --> 14:03.853
It will take more than a boar
for the Gods to favour Laius.

14:08.286 --> 14:09.453
Will you hunt again tomorrow?

14:11.353 --> 14:12.653
The Gods permitting.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.319
Then I shall accompany you.

14:14.353 --> 14:15.253
You?

14:15.286 --> 14:18.453
Was not Artemis
herself a woman?

14:18.486 --> 14:23.019
Of course, but her prey
had four legs, did it not?

14:40.186 --> 14:41.186
Leave us.

14:43.219 --> 14:46.153
It's all right,
say what you have come to say.

14:46.186 --> 14:50.153
I went back to the place,
just as you said.
To make sure.

14:50.186 --> 14:51.553
The baby was gone.

14:51.586 --> 14:53.019
Gone?

14:53.719 --> 14:56.053
Eaten by animals, perhaps?

14:56.086 --> 14:58.819
There was no blood.
Nothing like that.

14:58.853 --> 15:00.986
You're sure
you left him there?

15:01.019 --> 15:03.293
Sure you didn't take pity
at the last moment?

15:03.326 --> 15:04.759
It would only be natural.

15:04.793 --> 15:07.893
No, I swear!
I left him just as you said.

15:07.926 --> 15:10.193
Then there must be
some other explanation,
must there not?

15:10.226 --> 15:11.493
There were some boys.

15:11.526 --> 15:14.126
I followed them back
to Atlantis,

15:14.159 --> 15:17.326
and they ended up
in the streets
just north of the Canopic Way.

15:17.359 --> 15:18.959
And then I lost them.

15:18.993 --> 15:20.626
Did they have the child?

15:20.659 --> 15:22.226
I'm not sure.

15:25.326 --> 15:28.693
You did the right thing,
Andreas. Thank you.

15:28.726 --> 15:30.726
You may go.

15:35.259 --> 15:37.859
Whoever they were,
they can't be far.

15:37.893 --> 15:39.259
We will make enquiries.

15:39.293 --> 15:41.759
There's no time for enquiries.

15:41.793 --> 15:44.559
The boy must be found
and then dealt with.

15:44.593 --> 15:47.859
We shall have the palace
guards search the area
around the Canopic Way.

15:47.893 --> 15:49.759
What of your husband,
the King?

15:50.859 --> 15:52.493
You may leave him to me.

15:52.526 --> 15:56.793
The child will be found
before nightfall, My Lord,
I give you my word.

16:09.299 --> 16:11.066
He's gone.

16:11.099 --> 16:12.733
Operation Cot.

16:19.633 --> 16:21.533
And cover...

16:21.566 --> 16:23.633
And toy.

16:32.466 --> 16:35.699
(CLATTERING)

16:50.033 --> 16:51.033
(EXHALES)

16:53.499 --> 16:54.666
(COCK CROWS)

16:55.399 --> 16:59.233
(BABY CRIES)

17:09.139 --> 17:10.773
I did it last time.

17:10.806 --> 17:12.706
I did it the last twice.

17:18.539 --> 17:20.706
(BABY CONTINUES CRYING)

17:30.773 --> 17:32.939
-This is not fair!
-(BABY STOPS CRYING)

17:34.939 --> 17:36.273
There we go.

18:14.001 --> 18:15.001
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

18:19.601 --> 18:21.901
There are soldiers outside,
dozens of them.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.168
PYTHAGORAS: We know.

18:24.034 --> 18:25.334
JASON: What's going on?

18:25.368 --> 18:28.268
We've found out
who the little fellow is,
and it's not good news.

18:28.301 --> 18:29.734
It's King Laius' son.

18:29.768 --> 18:32.234
What? That can't be right!
Why would a king
want his own son dead?

18:32.268 --> 18:35.301
No one knows for sure,
but Laius has a wandering eye.

18:35.334 --> 18:38.034
A son born out of wedlock
might threaten the claim
of his true heir.

18:38.068 --> 18:39.968
They're coming this way!
We have to go.

18:40.001 --> 18:40.934
Where?

18:40.968 --> 18:42.801
I said we should have
left him there.

18:42.834 --> 18:44.268
You don't mean that, Hercules.

18:44.301 --> 18:46.234
I don't know
what I mean any more.

18:46.268 --> 18:47.768
(BANGING AT DOOR)

18:48.301 --> 18:49.501
Too late.

18:49.534 --> 18:50.968
Open up!
In the name of the King!

18:51.001 --> 18:53.068
There's a window at the back,
we can drop into the alley.

18:53.101 --> 18:55.368
It won't take them
five minutes
to know where we've gone.

18:55.401 --> 18:56.668
They don't know
anyone is here.

18:56.701 --> 18:58.334
They might have seen me.

18:58.368 --> 18:59.501
Oh, wonderful!

18:59.534 --> 19:00.901
(BANGING)

19:00.934 --> 19:03.441
Go to the tavern on
the Sacred Way.

19:03.474 --> 19:04.708
The landlord is
a friend of mine.

19:04.741 --> 19:06.308
We can't leave you here!

19:06.341 --> 19:08.641
You must! Go, please.

19:11.174 --> 19:12.841
(BANGING AT DOOR)

19:15.908 --> 19:17.208
Open up!

19:19.174 --> 19:20.841
I'm coming!

19:30.341 --> 19:31.474
What took you so long?

19:31.508 --> 19:33.574
Sorry, I was in the back.

19:48.908 --> 19:52.174
You two, take the house.
The rest of you, with me.
This way.

19:54.874 --> 19:56.574
Do you live
alone here, Medusa?

19:56.608 --> 19:58.041
Yes.

20:01.174 --> 20:02.848
I take in laundry.

20:13.748 --> 20:16.414
Hardly the hands
of a washerwoman.

20:16.448 --> 20:19.781
I do it as a favour.
My main job is at the palace.

20:20.781 --> 20:22.981
Which, of course,
can be verified?

20:23.014 --> 20:24.781
Ask anyone in the kitchens.

20:24.814 --> 20:26.114
Perhaps I will.

20:35.548 --> 20:37.548
Can I go now, please?
I should be at work.

20:37.581 --> 20:41.948
We're looking for a child,
Medusa, a baby.

20:41.981 --> 20:44.481
The mother is very anxious
to find him.

20:44.514 --> 20:47.014
What's that got to do with me?

20:47.048 --> 20:48.614
I'm not sure.

20:50.248 --> 20:51.914
Perhaps nothing.

20:54.081 --> 20:55.614
Can I go now?

20:57.414 --> 20:58.814
Yes. You may go.

21:02.114 --> 21:03.388
Wait...

21:06.521 --> 21:08.554
You forgot your shawl.

21:51.788 --> 21:53.454
We have to go down.

21:54.821 --> 21:56.388
We can't.

22:01.388 --> 22:02.454
Give me the boy.

22:02.488 --> 22:03.794
No! You'll never make it.

22:03.828 --> 22:05.128
Do you have a better idea?

22:05.161 --> 22:06.261
Come on, give him to me.

22:06.294 --> 22:08.461
He's right, Hercules.

22:12.161 --> 22:15.394
If you harm one hair
on his head...

22:28.461 --> 22:30.061
JASON: Hurry, they're coming!

22:30.094 --> 22:31.861
I don't think I can do this.

22:31.894 --> 22:33.694
Of course you can.

22:33.728 --> 22:34.894
No!

22:38.494 --> 22:39.961
-No.
-Hercules!

22:39.994 --> 22:41.861
-I'm too old for this.
-But...

22:41.894 --> 22:43.861
-Look after him.
-Look, stop.

22:43.894 --> 22:44.894
Go! Now!

23:02.628 --> 23:06.334
You've still got it, Hercules,
you still have!

23:12.734 --> 23:14.234
There it is.

23:19.534 --> 23:20.534
(BABY SQUALLS)

23:42.068 --> 23:43.234
(SWORD RE-ENTERS SHEATH)

23:44.468 --> 23:45.468
(SIGHS)

23:47.401 --> 23:51.068
I'm not sure how much
more of this I can take.

23:51.101 --> 23:53.234
We need to keep moving.

23:54.201 --> 23:55.634
You'll be safe enough here.

23:55.668 --> 23:57.234
Just try not
to make any noise.

23:57.268 --> 23:59.934
The walls are thinner
than they look.

24:10.641 --> 24:11.641
(DOOR BANGS SHUT)

24:15.841 --> 24:17.974
There was to be no trace.

24:18.008 --> 24:20.441
It must have slipped
from the boy's grasp.

24:21.374 --> 24:24.008
I gave him this
on the day he was born.

24:24.041 --> 24:26.974
You did the right thing,
Laius. You had no choice.

24:27.008 --> 24:29.108
You still don't.

24:33.074 --> 24:34.608
The boy must be found.

24:34.641 --> 24:37.908
The city's already sealed,
there can be no escape.

24:42.174 --> 24:44.508
I'm told you are a man
to be trusted.

24:44.541 --> 24:45.708
My Lord.

24:45.741 --> 24:47.574
You know what to do?

24:49.374 --> 24:51.874
There will be more
when it's done.

25:31.653 --> 25:35.458
-(BABY SCREAMING)
-Shh.

25:35.491 --> 25:36.591
Someone will hear.

25:36.625 --> 25:37.825
I know that, Pythagoras!

25:37.858 --> 25:39.358
Can't you keep him quiet?

25:39.391 --> 25:41.391
No! He's hungry.

25:42.325 --> 25:44.325
Maybe if I were
to sneak upstairs...

25:44.358 --> 25:47.958
It's too risky.
Medusa will be here soon.

25:47.991 --> 25:51.658
-That's what you said
an hour ago.
-(DOOR OPENS)

25:51.691 --> 25:54.691
Now look what you've done!
Get back there!

25:59.791 --> 26:00.791
(BABY CRIES LOUDLY)

26:08.498 --> 26:09.831
What are you doing to my boy?

26:11.298 --> 26:12.431
Hercules?

26:12.465 --> 26:14.265
I knew I couldn't trust you
with him.

26:14.298 --> 26:15.631
Why didn't you
give the signal?

26:15.665 --> 26:17.798
-What signal?
-The three knocks.

26:17.831 --> 26:20.398
Nobody told me.
What have they done
to you, hey?

26:20.431 --> 26:22.165
What have they done to you?

26:22.198 --> 26:25.698
He needs food.
You did bring food, right?

26:25.731 --> 26:26.765
Hercules?

26:26.798 --> 26:28.898
I've been avoiding
an army baying for my blood,

26:28.931 --> 26:32.098
I didn't have time
to go shopping, did I?
No, I didn't.

26:32.131 --> 26:33.665
Wonderful.

26:33.698 --> 26:38.598
He just needs some
proper care, that's all,
don't you? Don't you?

26:54.698 --> 26:56.798
One of us will have
to go up there.

26:56.831 --> 26:57.898
And ask for milk?

26:57.931 --> 26:59.465
In a tavern?

26:59.498 --> 27:01.265
Well, think of an excuse.

27:01.298 --> 27:03.098
Pythagoras is right,
it's too risky.

27:03.131 --> 27:04.498
The whole city
is looking for us.

27:04.531 --> 27:05.738
He needs food!

27:05.771 --> 27:06.938
-(CLATTER)
-What was that?

27:06.971 --> 27:08.238
I didn't hear anything.

27:09.838 --> 27:10.838
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

27:11.971 --> 27:13.538
At last!

27:16.771 --> 27:18.538
Oh, we were getting worried.

27:18.571 --> 27:20.238
I'm so sorry.

27:25.005 --> 27:26.205
Give me the child.

27:26.705 --> 27:28.138
I'd rather die!

27:29.338 --> 27:31.271
Admirable, but foolish.

27:31.305 --> 27:32.571
Never!

27:32.605 --> 27:36.438
If you won't give
Tiresias the child,
then give him to me,

27:36.471 --> 27:37.805
his mother.

27:38.871 --> 27:40.505
His mother?

27:40.538 --> 27:42.405
You call yourself a mother?

27:42.438 --> 27:47.505
How can I thank you?
Without you,
he surely would have died.

27:47.538 --> 27:50.705
If you wanted
the child to live,
why did you cast him out?

27:52.571 --> 27:55.605
You think I could do
such a thing?

27:55.638 --> 27:59.571
I carried him,
I gave birth to him,
I cared for him.

27:59.605 --> 28:01.438
If not you, then...

28:01.471 --> 28:05.111
The King.
King Laius cast him out.

28:05.845 --> 28:07.578
And to my shame, I helped him.

28:07.611 --> 28:08.711
Why?

28:08.745 --> 28:12.045
When the boy was born,
the King took him
to the Oracle.

28:12.078 --> 28:14.445
There he learned
his dreadful fate.

28:15.378 --> 28:17.045
If he lived,

28:18.045 --> 28:20.711
he would kill his father.

28:20.745 --> 28:24.545
The King then felt
he had no choice
but to sacrifice him.

28:29.311 --> 28:31.045
He belongs with you.

28:33.578 --> 28:34.578
(SOBBING)

28:38.778 --> 28:41.011
My poor, beautiful boy.

28:41.045 --> 28:43.245
TIRESIAS:
He can't stay here, Jocasta.

28:43.278 --> 28:45.845
If they find him,
they will kill him.

28:45.878 --> 28:47.445
I know.

28:47.478 --> 28:49.811
The net is closing fast.
He must be taken
from the city.

28:49.845 --> 28:51.278
The place is swarming
with soldiers!

28:51.311 --> 28:53.045
I can hold them back
for a few hours more.

28:53.078 --> 28:54.578
-I'll take him.
-Are you mad?

28:59.011 --> 29:01.345
You understand that
if you are caught,

29:01.378 --> 29:03.111
I will not be able
to protect you?

29:03.645 --> 29:05.151
I understand.

29:07.285 --> 29:10.018
No, I will not part
with him again.

29:10.051 --> 29:11.118
Jocasta, you have to.

29:11.151 --> 29:12.818
No. I cannot!

29:12.851 --> 29:18.418
If you love your son,
you must give him up,
send him to safety.

29:18.451 --> 29:21.518
To keep him here
will mean death for you both.

29:24.418 --> 29:26.551
I have some food and clothes.

29:28.385 --> 29:33.351
The Gods have spoken,
is it really your place
to intervene?

29:33.385 --> 29:37.018
If it means saving
a child's life, yes.

29:37.051 --> 29:39.118
You can give those to me.

29:39.151 --> 29:41.518
You're going as well?

29:41.551 --> 29:44.351
Having seen Jason
cope on his own,

29:44.385 --> 29:46.518
think the little fellow
needs me.

29:46.551 --> 29:50.418
Make for Zephlon,
on the border with Achaea.

29:50.451 --> 29:55.385
At the fortress there,
you will be met by soldiers
from Jocasta's father.

29:55.418 --> 29:58.118
He has promised to give
the child a good home.

29:58.151 --> 30:00.218
You won't be able to get out,
the city is sealed.

30:00.251 --> 30:02.885
Go via Telapias Gate.

30:02.918 --> 30:06.558
The King believes
I am in accord
with him on this,

30:06.591 --> 30:09.358
so I will do what
I can to reduce
the garrison there.

30:09.391 --> 30:11.258
The rest is up to you.

30:17.825 --> 30:19.191
You won't let him
out of your sight?

30:19.225 --> 30:21.325
Not for a second.

30:21.358 --> 30:24.758
You can trust him,
he'd give his life
for this boy.

30:24.791 --> 30:27.191
Is there no other way?

30:27.225 --> 30:29.425
None.

30:29.458 --> 30:33.358
The Oracle also foretold
the boy would
marry his mother.

30:37.058 --> 30:38.225
You coming?

30:38.258 --> 30:39.958
I don't have much choice.

30:39.991 --> 30:41.891
How long do you think
you'd last without me?

30:41.925 --> 30:44.925
Oh, let's see, a lifetime?

30:44.958 --> 30:46.758
You'd be in jail by sundown,
all of you.

30:46.791 --> 30:48.591
Come, I must leave.

30:48.625 --> 30:51.191
Wait. One last kiss.

31:04.825 --> 31:05.765
What was that for?

31:05.798 --> 31:08.031
For being a good man.

31:15.298 --> 31:17.965
You have my very life
in your hands.

31:19.265 --> 31:20.531
It's time.

31:56.831 --> 31:58.465
SOLDIER: You, stop!

31:59.998 --> 32:01.598
-Me?
-All of you!

32:01.631 --> 32:04.565
What are you doing here?
Don't you know
there's a curfew?

32:04.598 --> 32:07.838
Yes. Sorry,
we were in the tavern...

32:09.171 --> 32:10.738
You.

32:10.771 --> 32:12.005
Open your cloak.

32:12.038 --> 32:14.138
We didn't know about
the curfew, you see, so we...

32:14.171 --> 32:17.405
Open it. Or would you like me
to do it for you?

32:18.471 --> 32:21.405
Is this really necessary?

32:21.438 --> 32:22.505
(BABY BREAKS WIND)

32:22.538 --> 32:25.671
Pardon me,
not feeling too well.

32:25.705 --> 32:28.205
I must apologise
for my friend,

32:28.238 --> 32:32.138
he has spent the best part
of the day in the tavern.
(CHUCKLES)

32:32.171 --> 32:34.905
To be honest, I'm surprised
he's still standing.

32:34.938 --> 32:38.438
I've just had a couple
of drinks, that's all.

32:38.471 --> 32:44.771
I resemble your insinuation,
your insolution,

32:44.805 --> 32:46.171
it's not true.

32:46.205 --> 32:47.605
Open the cloak.

32:48.405 --> 32:51.038
(BABY BREAKS WIND)

32:51.671 --> 32:52.838
Whoops.

32:52.871 --> 32:54.205
Open it.

32:55.605 --> 32:57.538
Yes. Of course.

32:58.338 --> 32:59.338
(BABY BREAKS WIND)

33:05.678 --> 33:07.011
That wasn't even me.

33:07.045 --> 33:08.111
Sorry.

33:08.145 --> 33:11.011
Take him away,
and I don't want
to see you here again.

33:11.045 --> 33:14.345
-You won't, we promise.
-Thank you.

33:15.778 --> 33:17.478
-Ooh.
-(CHUCKLES)

33:17.511 --> 33:18.711
Good night.

33:18.745 --> 33:21.478
Good night.
Thank you very much.

33:21.511 --> 33:24.511
-I told you you needed me.
-HERCULES:
I would have been fine.

33:24.545 --> 33:27.211
What, with your
"Is this really necessary"?

33:27.245 --> 33:28.711
That put the fear
of God into them!

33:28.745 --> 33:30.078
HERCULES: I was working on it.

33:30.111 --> 33:31.978
We don't have time for this,
you can argue later.

33:32.011 --> 33:33.978
I'm not arguing,
I'm stating a fact.

33:34.011 --> 33:35.078
We need a change.

33:35.111 --> 33:36.345
What I've been saying
for months.

33:36.378 --> 33:38.211
Not us, him.

33:39.378 --> 33:40.978
I think there's been a leak.

33:41.511 --> 33:43.411
(GROANING)

33:53.401 --> 33:54.767
Right. That will have to do.

33:54.801 --> 33:56.719
He needs a proper wash.

33:56.752 --> 33:58.919
Strangely, Hercules,
I forgot to bring my bath.

34:02.252 --> 34:03.452
We're not going to make it.

34:03.485 --> 34:05.385
Why? We still have
a few hours until dawn.

34:05.419 --> 34:08.559
That's not the problem,
come and see for yourselves.

34:10.859 --> 34:12.559
SOLDIER: Move it!

34:17.425 --> 34:18.359
We can't risk it.

34:18.392 --> 34:20.059
We have to,
I promised the boy's mother!

34:20.092 --> 34:21.359
-We should go back.
-No.

34:21.392 --> 34:23.892
What do you suggest,
asking politely,

34:23.925 --> 34:26.425
"Please, Mr Soldier,
can we come through?"

34:28.892 --> 34:31.559
Maybe that's not such
a stupid idea...

34:49.425 --> 34:51.159
Stop! Get him!

35:25.132 --> 35:28.499
-Look, over there!
-Get him!

35:45.365 --> 35:46.999
This way...

35:52.899 --> 35:54.299
He's not coming, is he?

35:54.332 --> 35:56.265
Of course he is.

35:56.299 --> 35:58.332
If anyone can
escape those guards,
it's Jason.

35:58.365 --> 35:59.599
Do you think so?

35:59.632 --> 36:01.599
You've seen him,
he runs like the wind.

36:02.899 --> 36:05.299
I wouldn't say wind.

36:05.332 --> 36:09.505
When I was his age,
no man could run faster,
jump higher...

36:09.539 --> 36:11.839
Yes, yes, or fight better,
we know.

36:11.872 --> 36:13.472
He's young, that's all.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.905
No, Hercules, that is not all,

36:15.939 --> 36:17.205
and you know it.

36:17.972 --> 36:20.939
Jason is different, special.

36:22.872 --> 36:26.372
Yes. Yes, he is.

36:29.572 --> 36:31.872
So, he'll be fine, then.

36:33.905 --> 36:35.305
Of course he will.

36:38.572 --> 36:41.772
This is all my fault,
Pythagoras.

36:41.805 --> 36:43.639
I knew we shouldn't
have interfered.

36:43.672 --> 36:45.372
I knew it,
I should have insisted.

36:46.539 --> 36:48.272
And not have that baby
in your arms?

36:49.905 --> 36:52.405
You did the right thing,
Hercules.

36:54.505 --> 36:56.039
We all did.

37:00.739 --> 37:03.439
Perhaps we should start
for the border.

37:04.472 --> 37:05.672
But you said...

37:05.705 --> 37:07.305
If the guards catch Jason,

37:07.339 --> 37:09.612
they won't relent
until he tells them
where the boy is.

37:09.645 --> 37:11.212
He would never talk.

37:11.245 --> 37:14.678
A king's life is at stake,
Hercules, they won't stop
until he does.

37:14.712 --> 37:16.878
It's a good thing
they didn't catch him, then.

37:16.912 --> 37:18.378
Jason!

37:18.412 --> 37:20.145
Mind the baby!

37:21.745 --> 37:23.245
How did you get away?

37:23.278 --> 37:27.245
Oh, you know, the usual
combination of skill,
cunning, intelligence.

37:27.279 --> 37:28.712
I ran.

37:28.745 --> 37:29.879
Were you followed?

37:29.912 --> 37:32.245
No. They still think
I'm in the city.

37:32.279 --> 37:35.812
Help me gather some wood.
We need to light a fire.

37:39.379 --> 37:41.779
He's beyond the city walls.

37:42.345 --> 37:44.945
Oh, thank the Gods.

37:47.345 --> 37:48.845
Indeed.

37:52.712 --> 37:55.079
Why did you help me, Tiresias?

37:55.112 --> 37:58.412
You've served my husband
loyally for many years.

37:59.912 --> 38:02.312
And hope to do so
for many more.

38:03.445 --> 38:06.245
He is not a bad man, Jocasta.

38:06.279 --> 38:09.185
Just one who fears
the words of the Oracle.

38:12.552 --> 38:14.985
You haven't answered
my question.

38:18.919 --> 38:22.085
Sometimes one must follow
one's conscience

38:23.319 --> 38:25.119
not one's duty.

38:27.285 --> 38:29.985
Now, he needs feeding
every three hours,

38:30.019 --> 38:32.119
and don't let him sleep more
than two hours during the day

38:32.152 --> 38:34.352
or you'll never get him off
at night.

38:34.385 --> 38:35.685
I'll manage.

38:35.719 --> 38:39.185
You don't manage a baby,
you care for him.

38:39.219 --> 38:40.719
Hercules, he'll be fine.

38:40.752 --> 38:41.919
Does he have a name?

38:41.952 --> 38:45.052
The boy has a swollen foot,
so we thought perhaps,

38:45.085 --> 38:46.119
Oedipus?

38:48.985 --> 38:52.985
Oedipus, yes, I like it.

38:53.019 --> 38:55.952
Then Oedipus it shall be.

38:55.985 --> 38:57.385
You will look after him?

38:57.419 --> 38:58.652
With my life.

39:04.819 --> 39:06.385
Are we sure we're doing
the right thing?

39:06.419 --> 39:09.092
(VOICE BREAKING)
Of course we are,
how could you ask?

39:12.159 --> 39:14.259
-His little face.
-I know, I know...

39:14.292 --> 39:16.292
(BABY CRIES)

39:19.059 --> 39:21.059
(BABY CONTINUES CRYING)

39:26.625 --> 39:28.592
You are certain of this?

39:28.625 --> 39:29.859
Quite certain.

39:29.892 --> 39:31.425
I thought that
to be true before.

39:31.459 --> 39:33.225
This time there can
be no doubt,

39:33.259 --> 39:37.292
the boy did not suffer,
My Lord, that I can vouch for.

39:42.192 --> 39:44.059
What did my family do
to be so cursed?

39:44.092 --> 39:48.025
The Gods require
no reason for their cruelty.

39:50.359 --> 39:53.459
Make libations
to the Gods, Tiresias.

39:53.492 --> 39:55.659
They must be placated.

39:55.692 --> 39:57.359
At once, My Lord.

40:07.732 --> 40:09.965
Your kindness will not
be forgotten.

40:09.999 --> 40:12.232
We can expect
a return visit soon, I hope?

40:12.265 --> 40:13.265
Of course.

40:16.099 --> 40:19.199
-Your Highness.
-Your hospitality has been
much appreciated.

40:19.232 --> 40:23.565
You did all you could, Laius,
the rest we must trust
to the Gods.

40:30.899 --> 40:33.132
You must be sad to see him go.

40:33.165 --> 40:36.699
A royal king of such talents.

40:36.732 --> 40:39.399
I did my duty as a host,
that is all.

40:39.432 --> 40:40.999
You underestimate yourself.

40:41.032 --> 40:44.965
Ariadne, why must
we always quarrel?
I wish you nothing but well.

40:44.999 --> 40:47.565
And I wish
I could believe that.

41:00.032 --> 41:04.699
So, the question is,
straight to the baths
or straight to Medusa?

41:04.732 --> 41:06.599
It won't make any
difference either way.

41:06.632 --> 41:10.605
If I go straight to Medusa
it says, "There is nothing
more important than you".

41:10.639 --> 41:14.072
On the other hand, I am aware
that recent events have,

41:14.105 --> 41:17.705
shall we say,
produced their own odour.

41:17.739 --> 41:19.772
What do you think,
baths or Medusa?

41:19.805 --> 41:25.505
On balance,
a less smelly Hercules
is preferable to a smelly one.

41:25.539 --> 41:28.905
But I fear the distinction
may be lost on Medusa.

41:28.939 --> 41:31.372
You don't get it, do you?
She kissed me.

41:31.405 --> 41:33.405
-She kissed me.
-It was a peck.

41:33.439 --> 41:34.639
-It was a kiss.
-A peck.

41:34.672 --> 41:36.105
Whose cheek was it? Exactly.

41:36.139 --> 41:39.505
I'm going straight to her,
true love brooks
no hesitation.

41:39.539 --> 41:42.505
You better hope it has
no sense of smell, either.

41:47.272 --> 41:50.439
This will not end well
for Hercules.

41:50.472 --> 41:53.172
I don't know.
I think maybe you're wrong.

41:53.205 --> 41:54.505
They might be
very happy together.

41:54.539 --> 41:55.972
You're right.

41:56.005 --> 41:58.539
Perhaps they'll fall in love
and have a beautiful home

41:58.572 --> 42:01.905
and beautiful children
and pigs and chickens.

42:02.805 --> 42:05.139
Hercules
and beautiful children?

42:05.172 --> 42:06.872
I really can't see it.

42:06.905 --> 42:09.279
No, he'll get drunk
and gamble the home
and lose it.

42:09.312 --> 42:10.745
JASON: He'll eat the pigs.

42:10.779 --> 42:12.545
PYTHAGORAS: And the chickens,
and Medusa will be furious.

42:12.579 --> 42:13.712
JASON: It's not going
to end well, is it?

42:13.745 --> 42:15.445
PYTHAGORAS: Nope.
JASON: No.

42:30.150 --> 42:31.317
I have a message for you.

42:31.350 --> 42:34.017
The message, who was it from?

42:34.050 --> 42:35.217
(GROANING)

42:38.317 --> 42:40.317
-Run.
-Guards!

42:46.483 --> 42:47.817
You deliberately misled me!
