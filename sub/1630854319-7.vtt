16:34.231 --> 16:36.068
(clamoring continues)

16:46.756 --> 16:50.129
MULCAHEY:
I'm just as shocked as you are.

16:50.196 --> 16:53.770
But what can you
expect from a...

16:53.837 --> 16:56.208
"department that treats gays

16:56.275 --> 16:57.611
"like they don't exist,

16:57.678 --> 17:02.020
or worse, that they
shouldn't exist."

17:03.022 --> 17:06.328
You know, you surprise me,
Mulcahey.

17:06.395 --> 17:07.932
Because I'm reading a fag rag?

17:07.998 --> 17:12.541
PATRICK:
No. I didn't know
that you could read.

17:14.444 --> 17:16.181
I would offer to
clear out my desk,

17:16.248 --> 17:19.321
but I'm pretty sure
that's painted shut.

17:19.387 --> 17:20.857
I don't need your badge,
Detective Read.

17:20.924 --> 17:22.093
Give it to someone who does.

17:22.160 --> 17:24.732
Would you hang on a second?

17:24.799 --> 17:26.168
Have a seat, would you?

17:26.235 --> 17:27.605
There's nothing left to say.

17:27.671 --> 17:29.909
Oh, yeah, that-that's
the truth right there.

17:29.976 --> 17:32.581
You pretty much said it all.

17:32.648 --> 17:35.721
Made us sound like
a lost division of the SS.

17:35.787 --> 17:38.192
You know, believe it or not,
I get where that comes from.

17:38.259 --> 17:40.263
Some of these guys, they, uh...

17:40.329 --> 17:43.035
Well, I don't need to tell you.

17:43.102 --> 17:45.439
Just wish you hadn't
gone to the press.

17:45.507 --> 17:46.509
You know?

17:46.576 --> 17:49.080
Doesn't mean you're
getting fired.

17:49.147 --> 17:51.418
What makes you think
I'm not quitting?

17:51.485 --> 17:55.026
Well, I hope you'll stick around
and help us fix this mess.

17:55.092 --> 17:58.365
Relations with your,
uh, community.

17:58.432 --> 18:00.469
You know, you can head up
a sort of outreach.

18:00.537 --> 18:02.908
You must be getting a lot of
heat from upstairs, huh?

18:02.975 --> 18:06.516
Look, whether I am or not,
I'm sincere about this.

18:06.582 --> 18:07.785
"Sincere."

18:11.024 --> 18:13.530
Why don't we start with
reopening every single case

18:13.597 --> 18:16.368
you swept under the rug because
one of the victims was gay, huh?

18:16.435 --> 18:18.372
And I'm just thinking off
the top of my head here.

18:18.439 --> 18:20.076
How about that poor teenage boy

18:20.142 --> 18:22.581
who was beat half to death
in the Bronx?

18:22.648 --> 18:24.417
Or the couple who were
kissing in public

18:24.484 --> 18:26.856
and got pelted with bricks
in the street?

18:26.923 --> 18:30.196
Or the assholes who turned up
with baseball bats

18:30.262 --> 18:32.735
to a private party
and smashed the place up?

18:32.801 --> 18:34.572
And where are we, huh?

18:34.639 --> 18:38.078
Where the fuck are we with the
gay bar fire investigation?

18:38.145 --> 18:40.182
No?

18:40.951 --> 18:43.322
Not that sincere?

18:44.859 --> 18:46.596
Fuck you.

18:47.430 --> 18:50.336
Fuck this whole department.

18:51.673 --> 18:52.574
Detective Read.

18:52.641 --> 18:54.477
Nah, it's not "Detective"
anymore.

18:54.545 --> 18:55.847
No, sir.

18:57.083 --> 18:59.321
It's just Read now.

19:14.017 --> 19:16.388
Hey. Sorry about the wait.

19:16.455 --> 19:17.925
Had a little issue upstairs.

19:17.992 --> 19:22.166
So, uh, like I said, this is...

19:22.233 --> 19:25.874
This is going to be
extremely difficult.

19:25.941 --> 19:27.945
You sure you want to do this?

19:28.012 --> 19:29.982
I'm ready.

19:30.049 --> 19:31.886
All right.

19:31.953 --> 19:33.723
Let's go.

19:34.692 --> 19:36.696
There is, uh,
considerable damage

19:36.763 --> 19:38.666
to the postmortem
of these bodies,

19:38.733 --> 19:40.302
so I'm really not
expecting you to identify

19:40.369 --> 19:41.606
any of your friend's remains.

19:41.672 --> 19:44.244
But, uh, we got to take a shot.

19:44.310 --> 19:46.682
What did he do to them?

19:51.358 --> 19:52.861
He was taking them apart

19:52.928 --> 19:58.238
and using the pieces to
make his own creation.

19:58.305 --> 20:00.744

only ever had one family

20:24.492 --> 20:26.963
come forward to
identify remains?

20:27.029 --> 20:30.637
Guess they preferred their sons
dead than gay, huh?

20:41.592 --> 20:44.264
You just described it
to me, but...

20:44.330 --> 20:46.803
I still can't believe it.

20:51.211 --> 20:53.382

a victim of the Mai Tai Killer,

-Sully was one of

-What the fuck, Hannah?

22:29.340 --> 22:32.179
When I first heard he went
missing, I assumed he went home

22:32.246 --> 22:33.583
to be with his family because
he was sick and...

22:33.650 --> 22:35.119
Sully would've told me that.

22:35.185 --> 22:36.689
He...

22:36.756 --> 22:38.425
He disappeared in
the park that night.

22:49.347 --> 22:50.717
I don't know.

What Adam and I have is viral,

is a bacterial infection,

23:16.569 --> 23:18.740
similar to the deer on
Fire Island.

It's the ticks. I told you,
it's biological warfare.

Sully didn't go home to
his parents. I checked.

29:40.168 --> 29:42.507
Okay.

29:42.574 --> 29:44.276
I love you.

29:45.546 --> 29:47.584
I'll see you soon.

30:35.980 --> 30:38.051
(keys clacking)

30:38.118 --> 30:39.755
GINO:
Pride.

30:39.821 --> 30:42.761
What does the word mean
in the face of so much death?

30:42.827 --> 30:44.564
Pride is a construct,

30:44.631 --> 30:46.167
something we summon
to unite us

30:46.234 --> 30:48.706
when we feel tired and weak.

30:48.773 --> 30:52.012
Pride takes work,
but death comes easily.

30:52.079 --> 30:53.749
Death is an old friend,

30:53.816 --> 30:57.624
someone every gay person
has known their whole lives.

30:59.360 --> 31:02.232
As we walk the streets,
in our jobs, and in our homes,

31:02.299 --> 31:04.270
we have seen how
quickly the world's hatred

31:04.336 --> 31:07.276
towards us can
escalate to violence.

31:08.846 --> 31:11.250
In a glance or in a kiss,

31:11.317 --> 31:14.524
death is always lurking
around the corner.

31:14.591 --> 31:17.797
Some of us drown out death's
low roar with sex,

31:17.864 --> 31:22.406
some drown it out with
drugs or food or work.

31:22.473 --> 31:25.847
But no matter our vices, when
that low roar grows to a rattle,

31:25.913 --> 31:27.517
and when that rattle ruptures,

31:27.584 --> 31:30.088
we can no longer ignore
the seismic terror

31:30.155 --> 31:32.459
of our daily dance with death.

31:32.527 --> 31:33.863
Something is coming,

31:33.929 --> 31:35.465
something evil on the horizon.

31:35.533 --> 31:37.604
GINO:
Yes, the Mai Thai Killer
was a sick man.

31:37.670 --> 31:40.643
But was there some
ounce of virtue in his impulse

31:40.710 --> 31:42.045
to build a Sentinel,

31:42.112 --> 31:44.116
to protect the very
people he hurt?

31:44.183 --> 31:46.120
Was this his Pride?

31:46.187 --> 31:47.590
For those of us
on the outskirts--

31:47.657 --> 31:49.961
the unseen, the abused,
the demeaned,

31:50.028 --> 31:51.197
and the impoverished--

31:51.264 --> 31:52.934
the terror of our mortality

31:53.001 --> 31:55.573
leads us to destruction.

31:55.640 --> 31:57.075
We lash out,

31:57.142 --> 31:59.113
we hurt ourselves,
and those who love us.

31:59.180 --> 32:01.417
We lie, we steal,

32:01.484 --> 32:04.825
and if we are driven to it,
we kill.

32:05.793 --> 32:08.331
Who am I to judge those who
have gone down this path?

32:08.398 --> 32:10.803
Aren't their impulses
the same as mine?

32:10.870 --> 32:13.108
Isn't their rage justified?

32:13.174 --> 32:14.811
Did they simply choose death

32:14.878 --> 32:17.817
because it was closer
than Pride could ever be?

32:17.884 --> 32:20.088
The hypocrisy is untenable.

32:20.155 --> 32:24.598
Homosexuals must be treated
like criminals.

32:24.664 --> 32:27.637
GINO: What if we
found value in our trauma?

32:27.704 --> 32:29.340
Listened to it,
rather than ignored it?

32:29.406 --> 32:31.377
Could the force of
our collective anger

32:31.444 --> 32:34.150
actually become our savior?

32:34.216 --> 32:36.120
As I laid bound to the table
of the killer,

32:36.187 --> 32:38.458
looking death in the eye,
I didn't see evil.

32:38.526 --> 32:41.632
I saw suffering created
by the world who gave a man

32:41.698 --> 32:44.571
no other choice
but to destroy.

32:44.638 --> 32:48.612
Imagine if we enlisted our
gay rage as our Sentinel.

32:48.679 --> 32:51.518
If, rather than sinking
into the abyss of our despair,

32:51.585 --> 32:54.891
or painting over
our wounds with Pride,

32:54.958 --> 32:57.664
we used anger as our compass.

32:59.433 --> 33:01.572
Where would it lead us?

33:02.306 --> 33:04.143
What could it do for us?

33:04.210 --> 33:07.282
I saw a man who
become a monster

33:07.349 --> 33:09.688
because it's who the world
expected him to be.

33:10.990 --> 33:12.326
(whimpers)

33:12.392 --> 33:13.729
It's time we acknowledge
that this monster

33:13.796 --> 33:15.666
has been implanted in all of us.

33:18.906 --> 33:20.743
And the only way to release him

33:20.810 --> 33:22.514
is to release society's
expectations

33:22.580 --> 33:26.622
of who and what we should be.

33:30.128 --> 33:33.769
This is our freedom.

33:33.836 --> 33:38.044
This is our way out.

33:38.111 --> 33:41.417
This is our Pride.

33:41.484 --> 33:45.358
This is our Sentinel.
