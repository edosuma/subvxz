00:11.094 --> 00:13.138
Daly:
Give it up for our coaches.

00:13.179 --> 00:15.306
Camila Cabello,
our latest coach.

00:15.348 --> 00:16.891
Crushing it this year,
Camila.

00:16.933 --> 00:18.476
Crushing it!
Crushing it!

00:18.518 --> 00:21.104
Blake, you're an old-timer here
in the Battle Rounds.

00:21.146 --> 00:22.856
How's our friend Camila
doing so far?

00:22.897 --> 00:24.607
Yikes! He called you
an old-timer.

00:24.649 --> 00:26.276
He did say that,
didn't he?

00:26.317 --> 00:27.986
He's been here as long
as I have, though.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.487
Yes, that is true.

00:29.529 --> 00:31.698
I think the three of us
would agree

00:31.740 --> 00:34.159
that we all love Camila
as a person.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.535
Aww!
I'm your little buddy!

00:35.577 --> 00:36.619
Very talented.

00:36.661 --> 00:39.080
John: We agree.
We agree.

00:40.749 --> 00:42.208
But...
But...

00:42.250 --> 00:43.710
[ Laughter ]

00:43.752 --> 00:46.087
...she has the potential
to be a really sucky coach.

00:46.129 --> 00:50.091
Camila, whose team do you think
is a threat to yours?

00:50.133 --> 00:53.053
I honestly think everybody's,
except Blake.

00:53.094 --> 00:55.180
What?!
[ Laughter ]

00:55.221 --> 00:56.556
Daly:
Thank you, Coaches.

00:56.598 --> 00:58.975
The season 22 Battles
continue right now.

00:59.017 --> 01:01.227
[ Cheers and applause ]

01:01.269 --> 01:04.230
Woman: Okay.
Team Camila next Battle pairing.

01:04.272 --> 01:07.317
Eric Who,
you will be battling

01:07.359 --> 01:09.027
Sydney Kronmiller.

01:09.069 --> 01:12.781
Let's go, Eric!
Sydney!

01:12.822 --> 01:15.158
Sydney! Sydney!

01:15.200 --> 01:17.077
Girl, what we gonna do?!

01:17.118 --> 01:18.745
[ Laughter ]

01:18.787 --> 01:22.916
Woman: You will be performing
"Paparazzi" by Lady Gaga.

01:22.957 --> 01:24.918
Stop it.
Oh, yes! Yes!

01:24.959 --> 01:29.005
Give me Lady Gaga now!
Yes!

01:29.047 --> 01:32.842
I'm really excited for you
to meet Eric and Sydney.
I love it.

01:32.884 --> 01:35.762
In their blind auditions,
they both chose a singer

01:35.804 --> 01:38.264
who their voice was totally
unlike the original.

01:38.306 --> 01:39.933
So I was like,
"Oh, we should do a flip."

01:39.974 --> 01:41.976
You know what I mean?
They should do "Paparazzi."

01:42.018 --> 01:43.770
Oh. You're very good
at the pairings.
Thank you.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.313
You've been killing it.
Thank you.

01:45.355 --> 01:48.149
Hey, guys!
Oh! Oh, no!

01:48.191 --> 01:50.318
Yes!
Hey, guys!

01:50.360 --> 01:51.861
Don't run away.

01:51.903 --> 01:53.613
Camila! Charlie!

01:53.655 --> 01:56.157
I'm like, "Well, who's there
standing by Camila?"

01:56.199 --> 01:59.786
It was Charlie damn Puth!
Charlie!

01:59.828 --> 02:01.621
I love your whole outfit.
Charlie...

02:01.663 --> 02:02.956
Charlie: Oh, God.

02:02.997 --> 02:05.291
I was like, "Oh, my God!
I'm hugging Charlie Puth!"

02:05.333 --> 02:06.668
Perfect song.
Yeah.

02:06.710 --> 02:08.461
Thank you.
Really? Great.

02:08.503 --> 02:10.630
Yeah, yeah. We've had a lot
of fun with the arrangement.

02:10.672 --> 02:12.799
You both picked pop music
in your blind auditions, right?

02:12.841 --> 02:14.968
You picked Billie Eilish.
Billie Eilish. Yeah.

02:15.010 --> 02:19.264
* Nose, sleeping,
you're on your tippy toes *

02:19.305 --> 02:20.765
* Creeping *
Hey, hey!

02:20.807 --> 02:23.852
Camila turned around, like,
the third line I sang.

02:23.893 --> 02:26.396
* So criminal *

02:26.438 --> 02:27.939
It was unreal.

02:27.981 --> 02:31.234
I've never performed
any secular type of music.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.236
I've only performed
in the church.

02:33.278 --> 02:36.322
I love this song and this voice
that I wouldn't expect.

02:36.364 --> 02:37.949
And you have
a beautiful tone.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.951
That gave me so much motivation
and confidence.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.787
Like, I got on the team
that I wanted to be on,

02:42.829 --> 02:44.456
which is Team Camila!

02:44.497 --> 02:45.832
It's just -- It's unreal.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.959
And you picked...
"Latch" by Sam Smith.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.127
Yes.
Charlie: Wow!

02:49.169 --> 02:50.420
Which is why I was like,

02:50.462 --> 02:52.505
"Oh, they're pop,
but they're weird."

02:52.547 --> 02:55.008
[ Laughs ]
And I like that.

02:55.050 --> 02:59.346
* I'm latching on *

02:59.387 --> 03:02.349
* Latching on, bae *

03:04.059 --> 03:06.561
Oh, my God!
* I feel
we're close enough *

03:06.603 --> 03:08.188
Sydney:
To have Camila turn around

03:08.229 --> 03:10.523
and, like, react so positively
to kind of a different

03:10.565 --> 03:12.776
lower-sounding voice
that I've got,

03:12.817 --> 03:14.778
that was, like,
the highest compliment.

03:14.819 --> 03:17.155
Camila: That's a very, like,
vulnerable and intimate choice.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.115
You're just everything
that I'm looking for you.

03:19.157 --> 03:20.533
Awesome.
Thank you so much.

03:20.575 --> 03:22.869
I picked Camila because
she knows what it's like

03:22.911 --> 03:24.829
to be in our shoes,
and I thought that that would be

03:24.871 --> 03:27.874
immensely helpful to have
her insight going forward.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.793
Both:
* Baby, you'll be famous *

03:29.834 --> 03:33.380
* Chase you down
until you love me *

03:33.421 --> 03:36.257
* Papa, paparazzi *

03:36.299 --> 03:37.717
* I'll be your boy... *

03:37.759 --> 03:40.970
Camila:
I think Eric is such a star.

03:41.012 --> 03:44.683
He makes songs his own, and
he is, like, a whole package,

03:44.724 --> 03:46.518
which is what excites me
about him,

03:46.559 --> 03:48.770
is I think people are gonna
fall in love with him.

03:48.812 --> 03:51.398
* It don't have a price *

03:51.439 --> 03:53.608
* Loving you is... *

03:53.650 --> 03:56.611
Sydney's voice had a lot
of haunting qualities.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.655
And the scales
that she was singing --

03:58.697 --> 04:02.575
like, those very complex,
chromaticism-based scales.

04:02.617 --> 04:05.120
That's just music
mumbo-jumbo talk for

04:05.161 --> 04:06.496
she sang a lot of notes

04:06.538 --> 04:08.957
and she hit them all in a row
very well.

04:08.998 --> 04:11.543
Both: * Paparazzi *

04:11.584 --> 04:12.919
Wow.
Good God!

04:12.961 --> 04:15.630
When you sang together,
that was my favorite bits

04:15.672 --> 04:18.842
because you just sang it
so perfectly.

04:18.883 --> 04:21.428
Is there anything that
you're struggling with?

04:21.469 --> 04:23.596
I just don't want to
come off too dramatic.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.557
I actually wrote
in capital letters

04:25.598 --> 04:27.017
and circled it --
"Drama."

04:27.058 --> 04:28.268
Yay!

04:28.309 --> 04:30.395
Like, is Lady Gaga
"too dramatic"?

04:30.437 --> 04:31.771
Great point. Love that.
Right.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.190
If I'm being honest, you know,
like, growing up

04:34.232 --> 04:36.860
in South Carolina,
if somebody calls you dramatic,

04:36.901 --> 04:38.111
it's not good.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.529
They're trying to say
you need to calm down

04:39.571 --> 04:40.905
'cause you a boy.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.615
And for me,
growing up in the church

04:42.657 --> 04:44.117
in front of my stepdad

04:44.159 --> 04:45.994
singing all kind of
spiritual and gospel songs,

04:46.036 --> 04:47.704
and I'm about to be
singing "Paparazzi"

04:47.746 --> 04:49.956
about chasing a boy,
it's crazy,

04:49.998 --> 04:52.334
but I have transformed
as an artist.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.169
And I have a boyfriend
for the first time

04:54.210 --> 04:56.379
in my 22 years of living.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.340
He's very proud of me.

04:58.381 --> 04:59.883
He was just like,
"You deserve this.

04:59.924 --> 05:01.718
It's time for people
to see you shine."

05:01.760 --> 05:03.678
Sydney,
for those low verses,

05:03.720 --> 05:05.305
the placement
is really important.

05:05.347 --> 05:08.141
The more that you can kind
of picture the mask, like --

05:08.183 --> 05:10.602
Yeah.
Kind of making it nasal.

05:10.643 --> 05:11.811
* Na-na your show *

05:11.853 --> 05:13.688
Almost singing like --
Almost humorous.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.565
So you get to --
Because it is --

05:15.607 --> 05:17.442
* C to a F
is really hard to hear *

05:17.484 --> 05:18.651
Yeah.
And, by the way,

05:18.693 --> 05:20.528
when it goes
to the F sharp minor...

05:20.570 --> 05:21.738
* My *

05:21.780 --> 05:24.157
Yeah, it's crazy.
You just -- Pfft.

05:24.199 --> 05:26.910
Sydney:
It was crazy just to hear
Charlie Puth giving us pointers

05:26.951 --> 05:30.830
because he's an influence
that I've had for so long.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.499
I had heard his song
"Attention."

05:32.540 --> 05:34.125
I was like,
"Who's Charlie Puth?"

05:34.167 --> 05:35.502
Looked at his Wikipedia page.

05:35.543 --> 05:37.045
Under Education, it says
Berklee College of Music.

05:37.087 --> 05:39.005
And that's where I decided
I wanted to go.

05:39.047 --> 05:41.675
So now I'm a senior at Berklee,
and I've been studying there

05:41.716 --> 05:43.176
music, writing, and production.

05:43.218 --> 05:46.054
Now I'm out here just, like,
doing what I've actually

05:46.096 --> 05:47.514
always wanted to do for you.

05:47.555 --> 05:49.599
For you, Eric,
the breath support...

05:49.641 --> 05:51.184
Okay.
...is really important.

05:51.226 --> 05:54.688
You can achieve that by doing
a little [yawns] yawn.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.856
And you'll get a little bit
more oxygen that way.

05:56.898 --> 05:59.484
Can we hear you guys
both do that first verse

05:59.526 --> 06:01.695
with that kind of,
like, in-the-mask nasal

06:01.736 --> 06:04.698
and, like, coming out through
that roof of your mouth?

06:04.739 --> 06:06.866
* We are the crowd *
Yes.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.993
* And we're coming out *
Wow.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.245
Way better.

06:10.286 --> 06:12.288
* Leather and jeans *
Yeah.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.666
* Garage glamorous *

06:14.708 --> 06:16.584
Yes! So much better!
A world of a difference.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.503
A million times better.
Wow.

06:18.545 --> 06:19.754
Awesome. Thank you.
Thank you.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.716
I think this is
gonna be a close one

06:22.757 --> 06:24.718
because they both shine
in their own way.

06:24.759 --> 06:27.053
I'm excited for you guys.
But it's gonna be about

06:27.095 --> 06:30.557
who brings that special sauce
the day of the show.

06:30.598 --> 06:32.058
They're killing, right?
Charlie: Yes.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.476
That was so good.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.603
This round is gonna be
especially tricky for Camila.

06:35.645 --> 06:38.732
The person who really
pulls everybody in

06:38.773 --> 06:40.275
is gonna be
the true winner of this.

06:40.316 --> 06:43.570
There's so many unique voices
here today at NBC's "The Voice."

06:43.611 --> 06:45.113
I know.
Daly: Coming up...

06:45.155 --> 06:51.411
* Eyeliner
and cigarettes *

06:51.453 --> 06:52.829
* Shadow is burnt *

06:52.871 --> 06:54.330
Your voice is shocking.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.416
Daly: ...the artists leave
our coaches in turmoil.

06:56.458 --> 06:57.959
Who is the winner
of this battle?

06:58.001 --> 07:00.086
You pick Carson!
You pick!

07:00.128 --> 07:04.007
And later, a battle
that leads to an epic save.

07:04.049 --> 07:07.177
Both: * And I stood there
like a fence post *

07:07.218 --> 07:08.762
That was so awesome.

07:08.803 --> 07:10.430
Your singing
was incredible.

07:10.472 --> 07:12.474
All:
* How deep is your love *

07:12.515 --> 07:13.683
* How deep is your love *

07:13.725 --> 07:15.435
Daly: Ohh!
Wow!

07:15.477 --> 07:17.687
Oh, my gosh!
That's the sound of a save!

07:24.319 --> 07:25.653
* This is "The Voice" *

10:24.708 --> 10:26.376
Beautiful.

10:26.418 --> 10:29.504
I really loved this performance
because it was just so weird.

10:29.546 --> 10:33.258
And I mean that in a good way.
Like, great weird.

10:33.299 --> 10:36.511
Eric, you're so rare
because everything about you

10:36.553 --> 10:38.471
is just so theatrical and...

10:38.513 --> 10:40.473
[ Cheers and applause ]

[ Laughs ]

10:42.142 --> 10:44.144
Yeah, I loved it.
It was so engaging.

10:44.185 --> 10:48.148
And that's just the visual.
Your voice is so beautiful.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.566
Thank you.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.026
And, Sydney,
your vocal style

10:51.067 --> 10:53.028
is different than anything
out there right now.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.320
Thank you.
It's so unique.

10:54.362 --> 10:56.573
But I couldn't keep
my eyes off Eric.

10:56.614 --> 10:59.200
You have this alternative aura,
an edge about you,

10:59.242 --> 11:02.037
but yet you sing like
a soulful pop singer,

11:02.078 --> 11:05.790
so it's, like,
a weird contrast of styles.

11:05.832 --> 11:08.710
You kind of won me
on that level, so...

11:08.752 --> 11:11.046
Thank you so much.

11:11.087 --> 11:14.716
Sydney, so few people
can sing that low

11:14.758 --> 11:16.885
and sing it really well,
live especially.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.136
That was really remarkable.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.721
And the fact
that you can do that

11:19.763 --> 11:22.474
and still have the higher notes
in your register, too,

11:22.515 --> 11:24.184
you really gave
a great performance.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.353
That was really lovely.
Thank you so much.

11:26.394 --> 11:27.520
Thank you.

11:27.562 --> 11:30.106
Eric, you just have
a light within you,

11:30.148 --> 11:32.400
and you let it exude,

11:32.442 --> 11:34.861
and your voice has
a really cool lilt to it.

11:34.903 --> 11:36.321
It floats in a certain way.
Thank you.

11:36.363 --> 11:39.074
I really found it so cool
to listen to.

11:39.115 --> 11:41.034
Both of you
were phenomenal.

11:41.076 --> 11:43.578
Thank you.
Thank you.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.914
Sydney,
your voice is shocking.
Thank you.

11:45.955 --> 11:49.167
And if it came on the radio,
I'd turn it up.

11:49.209 --> 11:52.212
Thank you so much.
I appreciate that.

11:52.253 --> 11:55.173
And Eric comes out here
like the happiest person

11:55.215 --> 11:58.009
and makes everybody happy
when they sing.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.135
You know what I'm saying?

11:59.177 --> 12:00.637
That is --
That is true.

12:00.679 --> 12:03.640
Our new buddy here has got a --
got a tough one.

12:03.682 --> 12:05.350

What would Blake do?

12:05.392 --> 12:08.937
You know, I couldn't
say no to Eric.

Thank you, Coaches!

the final decision.

12:13.358 --> 12:16.528
I know, Carson Daly!
I know.

12:16.569 --> 12:17.946
Sydney, I have literally

12:17.987 --> 12:19.948
never heard a voice
like yours before.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.616
Thank you so much.

12:21.658 --> 12:25.328
Your note choices were
so different and weird.

12:25.370 --> 12:28.206
And the way you slide
in and out of falsetto.

12:28.248 --> 12:34.004
And then, Eric, I saw you
really grow as an artist

12:34.045 --> 12:35.964
and step into somebody

12:36.006 --> 12:39.634
that I'm really excited
to hear on the radio,

12:39.676 --> 12:42.554
see perform in shows.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.305
Um, and I'm so stressed.

you love them both,
but the time has come.

to the Knockouts.

Congratulations.

he's just too captivating.

I'm curious to see
how he evolves,

13:41.321 --> 13:43.823
and I just want
to keep watching him.

14:00.131 --> 14:03.093
Camila: I was really sad
that I couldn't save Sydney

14:03.134 --> 14:05.220
because she was
one of the people

14:05.261 --> 14:07.430
I was most excited about
on my team.

14:07.472 --> 14:10.225
It's hard. I know.
You did good.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.018
Yeah.

14:12.060 --> 14:14.646
My team this year is -- I got
a little bit of everything.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.022
And this is gonna be

14:16.064 --> 14:17.732
one of my tough pairings
that I have to do.

14:17.774 --> 14:20.902
I'm the only person that turned
around for both of these guys.

14:20.944 --> 14:23.238
Oh, wow.
Nobody else knows
crap about country.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.240
And they won't admit it.
There you go. Yeah.

14:25.281 --> 14:28.284
And so I always know they're
gonna wait and see what I do.

14:28.326 --> 14:30.620
And so now I've learned to
just wait until the last minute

14:30.662 --> 14:31.746
to push my button.

14:31.788 --> 14:33.248
Then turn around.
That's right.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.833
I've paired Benny and Brayden
against each other.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.584
I think Benny is definitely
a little bit more polished

14:36.626 --> 14:38.003
of a performer.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.879
Brayden has tons of potential,
and you can really see

14:39.921 --> 14:42.632
someone as young as he is
develop and come a long way.

14:42.674 --> 14:45.719
I just wanted to see which one
of these two could stand out

14:45.760 --> 14:48.096
as the better male vocalist.

14:48.138 --> 14:50.140
[ Chuckles ] What's up?
No way.

14:50.181 --> 14:52.392
Y'all come in
and meet Jimmie Allen.

14:52.434 --> 14:54.477
How y'all doing, man?
What's up, bro?
How are you doing?

14:54.519 --> 14:56.438
When I walked in the room
and saw that Blake's adviser

14:56.479 --> 14:59.065
was Jimmie Allen,
I was so excited.

14:59.107 --> 15:01.234
A really current artist
with a lot of hits.

15:01.276 --> 15:03.528
He won a CMA Award.
Between him and Blake,

15:03.570 --> 15:05.697
I know that I'm gonna get
a lot from both of them.

15:05.739 --> 15:08.324
Good to see you, man.
God. I forgot how tall you are.

15:08.366 --> 15:10.243
How tall are you?
Like 6'4".

15:10.285 --> 15:12.245
Man, if I was 6'4",
I'd be in the NBA, dude.

15:12.287 --> 15:13.788
Would you?
Yeah.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.123
You can have
a longer career, though,

15:15.165 --> 15:16.833
with what you chose.
True.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.293
'Cause you can't tell a girl,

15:18.335 --> 15:19.669
"I'm-a dunk this basketball
for you."
Right.

15:19.711 --> 15:21.254
But you can say,
"I'm-a write this song for you."

15:21.296 --> 15:22.297
Yeah.
That's right.

15:22.339 --> 15:23.548
How you been?
I'm good.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.300
I don't remember
you being this shy

15:25.342 --> 15:26.885
when you were up there
singing your butt off.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.636
I guess I played it off
pretty well.

15:28.678 --> 15:31.222
I was so nervous.
Man. That's what's up.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.641
I was shaking out of my shoes
before I went in.

15:33.683 --> 15:37.187
Brayden brought his
entire family up on stage.

15:37.228 --> 15:38.813
Brayden:
My family's real important.

15:38.855 --> 15:41.524
I feel like with everything
I do, they're supporting me.

15:41.566 --> 15:44.486
I love how happy your sister is.
I mean, literally, she is --

15:44.527 --> 15:46.112
Oh, I can't even handle it.

15:46.154 --> 15:48.448
I haven't been singing that
long, maybe a year and a half,

15:48.490 --> 15:51.242
so to get a chair turn
from Blake, I was so happy.

15:51.284 --> 15:54.996
[ Cheers and applause ]

15:55.038 --> 15:57.040
* You *
Yeah!

15:57.082 --> 15:59.459
Let's mess with this thing.
Alright.

15:59.501 --> 16:02.796
I gave these guys "Pretty Heart"
by Parker McCollum

16:02.837 --> 16:04.506
because this is a good song

16:04.547 --> 16:07.175
for both of them to feel
comfortable and settle down.

16:07.217 --> 16:10.178
* Didn't think
I was a bad guy *

16:10.220 --> 16:12.681
* I knew that
you were good *

16:12.722 --> 16:14.474
Jimmie:
What I liked about Benny's voice

16:14.516 --> 16:16.267
is how his vocal cut through.

16:16.309 --> 16:19.020
You could hear every word,
every syllable.

16:19.062 --> 16:20.563
And that's a rare gift.

16:20.605 --> 16:23.525
* I'm the one
that dropped the ball *

16:23.566 --> 16:27.529
Brayden kind of gave me
a country John Mayer vibe.

16:27.570 --> 16:29.614
It's not huge and powerful,

16:29.656 --> 16:32.325
but I was noticing
when he felt comfortable

16:32.367 --> 16:34.661
with what he was singing
it sounded really good.

16:34.703 --> 16:38.123
* What does that say
about me? *

16:38.164 --> 16:40.542
I sang a pop song
for my blind audition,

16:40.583 --> 16:42.419
but I like that Blake realized

16:42.460 --> 16:44.713
that me and Benny
could do country, too,

16:44.754 --> 16:46.881
because that's
what I want to do.

16:46.923 --> 16:50.301
I feel like newer country
is what you hear on the radio,

16:50.343 --> 16:51.761
or at least in my town.

16:51.803 --> 16:54.264
Kind of reminds me
of just the times in the car

16:54.305 --> 16:56.182
with your family
rolling the windows down

16:56.224 --> 16:58.226
and just jamming
to some country music.

16:58.268 --> 17:02.397
I think the singing is there.
It's just now being believable.

17:02.439 --> 17:04.733
Jimmie: Every song you sing,
whether it's your song or not,

17:04.774 --> 17:06.526
find a way
to make that song yours.
Mm-hmm.

17:06.568 --> 17:09.404
What do y'all think about
when y'all sing that song?

17:09.446 --> 17:11.698
I connect with the song
on a very personal level.

17:11.740 --> 17:13.950
After having been married
for five years,

17:13.992 --> 17:15.326
I went through a divorce.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.245
The song says, "I didn't think
I was a bad guy,

17:17.287 --> 17:18.872
and I knew you were good."

17:18.913 --> 17:21.082
And when you go through
a heartbreak,

17:21.124 --> 17:24.586
it's difficult not to feel like
you're a bad person.

17:24.627 --> 17:28.548
So it hits close to home
with me.

17:28.590 --> 17:30.633
I had all this emotion
that I needed to get out,

17:30.675 --> 17:33.136
and that's when I started
performing again and realized

17:33.178 --> 17:35.055
that I need music in my life.

17:35.096 --> 17:36.598
And music is everything to me.

17:36.639 --> 17:39.184
When Blake turned,
I had this wave of relief.

17:39.225 --> 17:42.604
* Baby, you wanna dance
till the sunlight cracks *

17:42.645 --> 17:44.439
* When they say
the party's over *

17:44.481 --> 17:46.191
* Then we'll bring it
right back *

17:46.232 --> 17:48.902
Welcome to Team Blake,
buddy.

17:48.943 --> 17:51.321
Do y'all both always play
guitars when you sing?

17:51.363 --> 17:54.866
Always playing it,
like, in gigs and at home.

17:54.908 --> 17:57.285
Are you playing it because
you're adding to the song

17:57.327 --> 17:59.037
or are you playing it
because it's a crutch?

17:59.079 --> 18:01.581
It's just something to always
think about moving forward.

18:01.623 --> 18:03.500
Or are you playing it
to hide your gut?

18:03.541 --> 18:05.460
Yeah, to hide your gut.
[ Laughs ]

18:05.502 --> 18:07.295
How old are you?
29.

18:07.337 --> 18:09.130
And...?
15.

18:09.172 --> 18:10.674
15.
Wait, wait. What?

18:10.715 --> 18:11.633
Yeah.

18:11.675 --> 18:13.593
Boy, I got socks
older than you.

18:13.635 --> 18:16.221
The thing that's standing out
is he's clearly

18:16.262 --> 18:18.306
been doing this longer
than you have.

18:18.348 --> 18:20.308
And because of that,
he's more comfortable.

18:20.350 --> 18:22.227
Yeah.
You're gonna think
I'm crazy

18:22.268 --> 18:23.728
when I say this to you.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.980
The first time
I ever met Taylor Swift

18:26.022 --> 18:27.732
was when she was 16.

18:27.774 --> 18:30.819
She didn't realize that
the world was literally

18:30.860 --> 18:33.655
at her fingertips,
and you have that quality,

18:33.697 --> 18:36.157
but you got to start
singing like that.

18:36.199 --> 18:38.326
Nerves are good.
It means you care.

18:38.368 --> 18:41.621
But find ways
to make sure it's fun.

18:41.663 --> 18:43.748
I'm just gonna practice
every day,

18:43.790 --> 18:47.168
try to get better
until the real stage performance

18:47.210 --> 18:49.254
and then do my best
out there.

18:49.295 --> 18:50.672
He's kind of a shy guy,
Benny,

18:50.714 --> 18:52.716
until he gets in front
of that microphone,

18:52.757 --> 18:54.926
and then you're projecting,
you're singing loud,

18:54.968 --> 18:58.346
and it sounds great, but you're
a little bit freaked out.

18:58.388 --> 19:00.015
But you need to know
if you can get over this hump,

19:00.056 --> 19:03.601
you'll never be handed something
as weird as "The Voice" again.

19:03.643 --> 19:06.271
And that's what I love about
starting on this platform,

19:06.312 --> 19:07.814
because when you leave here,

19:07.856 --> 19:10.150
the Grammys and things like that
seem like a cakewalk.

19:10.191 --> 19:13.111
It's like, "Oh, you just want me
to go out and sing?

19:13.153 --> 19:14.696
Oh, God, I can do that."

19:14.738 --> 19:17.365
I have a little bit of worry
about the more country twang

19:17.407 --> 19:19.034
that Brayden has over me.

19:19.075 --> 19:20.618
I specialize more in pop,

19:20.660 --> 19:23.246
and so I really have to
tap into my experience

19:23.288 --> 19:25.749
as a performer
and really convince Blake

19:25.790 --> 19:27.751
that I'm the one
that should be here.

19:27.792 --> 19:30.462
Now just go out there
and sing the hell out of it

19:30.503 --> 19:32.922
and make this one of
the worst days of my life.

19:32.964 --> 19:34.924
Between Brayden and Benny,
I don't know.

19:34.966 --> 19:37.260
It's one of them things
where you got to wait

19:37.302 --> 19:39.220
and see who shows up,
because you can be

19:39.262 --> 19:41.890
more experienced, and things
completely go opposite

19:41.931 --> 19:43.224
when the lights come on.

19:43.266 --> 19:44.559
This is a in-the-moment,

19:44.601 --> 19:46.019
kind of wait and
see what's gonna happen.

19:46.061 --> 19:47.354
Thank you.
Thanks, guys.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.856
Alright. Let's just
run through it once.

19:49.898 --> 19:51.066
Yeah.

19:51.107 --> 19:53.068
I think with Jimmie saying like,

19:53.109 --> 19:54.694
"Yeah, the guitar
is nice to have,

19:54.736 --> 19:57.405
but is it gonna make you
sing the best?"

19:57.447 --> 19:58.740
In rehears --
I don't know about you --

19:58.782 --> 20:00.575
I felt like -- I felt
a little weird

20:00.617 --> 20:02.535
playing the guitar
with the whole band.

20:02.577 --> 20:04.329
'Cause you can't even
really hear us.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.748
I feel like we're just playing
it to have it in our hands.

20:06.790 --> 20:08.833
We might just want
to drop the guitar

20:08.875 --> 20:12.170
and sing the song,
and we'll see how it goes.

20:12.212 --> 20:13.338
Sounds good.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.340
Let's do this.
Let's do it.

20:21.137 --> 20:22.305
* This is "The Voice" *

20:22.347 --> 20:24.265
Daly: Welcome back.

20:24.307 --> 20:26.476
Who will win
this team Blake battle?!

20:26.518 --> 20:29.396
Will it be
the 29-year-old from Montana,

20:29.437 --> 20:31.064
Benny Weag?

20:31.106 --> 20:32.273
[ Cheers and applause ]

20:32.315 --> 20:34.275
Oh. Whoa, ho!
Comin' in hot!

20:34.317 --> 20:37.904
Or the 15-year-old
from Michigan,

20:37.946 --> 20:40.073
Brayden Lape?

20:40.115 --> 20:41.324
[ Cheers and applause ]

20:41.366 --> 20:43.576
15. Oh, my gosh!

20:47.455 --> 20:48.665
Let's go.

20:48.707 --> 20:50.709
The Battle starts now.

20:54.004 --> 20:57.340
**

20:57.382 --> 20:59.217
That's country right there.

20:59.259 --> 21:01.720
That's country.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.764
* I didn't think
I was a bad guy *

21:04.806 --> 21:07.892
* I knew
that you were good *

21:07.934 --> 21:11.646
* You were golden
on the inside *

21:11.688 --> 21:15.108
* And you loved me
the best you could *

21:15.150 --> 21:18.403
* I'm the one
who dropped the ball *

21:18.445 --> 21:22.532
* Got you high
and let you fall *

21:22.574 --> 21:28.163
* Let the best thing
I ever had slip away *

21:29.497 --> 21:33.335
* What does that say
about me *

21:33.376 --> 21:36.713
* I could do you
like I did? *

21:36.755 --> 21:40.550
* That I can break
an angel's wings? *

21:40.592 --> 21:43.887
* What does that say
about me *

21:43.928 --> 21:47.932
* That I stood there
like a fence post *

21:47.974 --> 21:51.353
* As you drove off
in your car *

21:51.394 --> 21:54.856
* What does that say
about me *

21:54.898 --> 21:57.734
* Now that I've broke *

21:57.776 --> 22:05.241
* Your pretty heart? *

22:05.283 --> 22:12.957
* Your pretty heart *

22:12.999 --> 22:17.045
* What does that say
about me *

22:17.087 --> 22:20.298
* I could do you
like I did? *

22:20.340 --> 22:23.927
* That I can break
an angel's wings? *

22:23.968 --> 22:27.972
* What does that say
about me? *

22:28.014 --> 22:31.601
Both: * That I stood there
like a fence post *

22:31.643 --> 22:34.896
* As you drove off
in your car? *

22:34.938 --> 22:38.608
* What does that say
about me *

22:38.650 --> 22:41.528
* Now that I've broke *

22:41.569 --> 22:43.363
* Your pretty heart? *

22:43.405 --> 22:45.407
* Your pretty heart *

22:45.448 --> 22:48.785
* Your pretty heart *

22:48.827 --> 22:50.620
* Your pretty heart *

22:50.662 --> 22:52.539
* Your pretty heart *

22:52.580 --> 22:55.917
* Your pretty heart *

22:55.959 --> 23:02.966
* Your pretty he-a-a-art *

23:03.008 --> 23:11.433
Both:
* Your pretty he-a-a-a-art *

23:11.474 --> 23:14.477
[ Cheers and applause ]

23:14.519 --> 23:15.979
So cute.

23:16.021 --> 23:17.522
**

23:17.564 --> 23:19.691
I like that break.
That break he has.

23:19.733 --> 23:22.777
Me too. I love that.

23:22.819 --> 23:25.613
Guys, that was so awesome!

23:25.655 --> 23:27.073
Thank you.
Thank you.

23:27.115 --> 23:29.784
Amazing job. Brayden,
I can't believe you're 15.

23:29.826 --> 23:31.703
I think he's grown a foot
since I saw him.

23:31.745 --> 23:33.163
[ Laughs ] I know.

23:33.204 --> 23:35.957
15. That's the same age
I was when I was on...

23:35.999 --> 23:37.292
Did another
competition show.

23:37.334 --> 23:39.669
Did a singing
competition show!
Amazing.

23:39.711 --> 23:42.255
I would have so had
a crush on you.

23:42.297 --> 23:43.965
[ Laughter ]

23:44.007 --> 23:45.842
I think you have
a beautiful tone.

23:45.884 --> 23:48.428
I love that crack
that you have in your voice.
Yeah.

23:48.470 --> 23:50.930
It is very
pop-record friendly.

23:50.972 --> 23:53.391
And the fact
that you're 15 is crazy.

23:53.433 --> 23:55.060
Thank you.

23:55.101 --> 23:57.854
And, Benny, your voice,
when you came in, I was like,

23:57.896 --> 24:01.274
"Oh, my God. Why did I not
turn around for you?"

24:01.316 --> 24:02.692
You're a great singer.

24:02.734 --> 24:04.986
For me, the winner
of this Battle was Brayden

24:05.028 --> 24:07.197
just because I feel like
that tone captures

24:07.238 --> 24:09.699
that 15-year-old innocence
that you have.

24:09.741 --> 24:11.951
Like, you can hear that
in your voice.

24:11.993 --> 24:13.286
Thank you.

24:13.328 --> 24:15.372
[ Cheers and applause ]

24:15.413 --> 24:17.207
Benny, you came out
with so much energy.

24:17.248 --> 24:19.626
Just even punching the air,
like, ready to go.

24:19.668 --> 24:21.586
Yeah.
Your singing
was incredible.

24:21.628 --> 24:23.171
I just think
stage-presence wise,

24:23.213 --> 24:24.964
it felt a little bit
almost too much.

24:25.006 --> 24:26.716
Maybe just focus more
on the lyric,

24:26.758 --> 24:28.218
feel the song
through your body.

24:28.259 --> 24:30.011
That would be my advice.
Yeah. Thank you.

24:30.053 --> 24:32.013
Brayden, you have a beautiful,
beautiful voice.

24:32.055 --> 24:35.058
I can't wait to see what happens
in the next few years

24:35.100 --> 24:36.851
'cause there's just
so much growing to do.

24:36.893 --> 24:39.229
Not literally.
Yeah. No more growing.

24:39.270 --> 24:41.064
Well, maybe.

24:41.106 --> 24:43.858
Benny, I love the tone
of your voice.

24:43.900 --> 24:46.069
It just sounds confident
and assured.

24:46.111 --> 24:48.279
I think sometimes you push
a little too much,

24:48.321 --> 24:50.990
which can take away from
the beauty of your voice,

24:51.032 --> 24:52.742
which is really great.
Thank you.

24:52.784 --> 24:54.661
And then, Brayden,
I feel like you have

24:54.703 --> 24:56.287
a bit more to develop
as a vocalist,

24:56.329 --> 24:58.915
but your tone is
so interesting and cool.

24:58.957 --> 25:02.085
So that's the choice
that Blake will have to make.

25:02.127 --> 25:03.378
Daly:
Thank you, Coaches.

25:03.420 --> 25:05.171
All right, Blake,
final decision's yours.

25:05.213 --> 25:07.173
Give us some thoughts
on the Battle first.

25:07.215 --> 25:11.136
The line in the song is,
"What does that say about me?"

25:11.177 --> 25:13.013
Benny, I think your approach
was more like,

25:13.054 --> 25:14.723
"What did you say
about me?"

25:14.764 --> 25:16.474
Like, coming out here
ready to fight,

25:16.516 --> 25:18.143
just in your
stage presence.

25:18.184 --> 25:21.229
Because, man, I thought
you sang really good.
Thank you.

25:21.271 --> 25:23.773
And then, Brayden,
today, you know,

25:23.815 --> 25:26.317
even more than in rehearsal,
it's like, "Oh, my gosh.

25:26.359 --> 25:28.611
He is only 15." You know?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

25:28.653 --> 25:30.447
But I like that tone
in your voice

25:30.488 --> 25:33.199
and the youth and some of
the inexperience, even,

25:33.241 --> 25:35.910
because there's something about
that that's endearing.

25:35.952 --> 25:38.580
Blake, who is the winner
of this Battle?

25:38.621 --> 25:47.255
**

25:47.297 --> 25:49.132
Winner of this Battle
is Brayden.

25:49.174 --> 25:51.843
Brayden, congratulations. You're
moving on to the Knockouts

25:51.885 --> 25:53.553
for Team Blake.

25:53.595 --> 25:56.222
Blake: Brayden's just got all
this potential and star quality

25:56.264 --> 25:58.224
about what he does
and just who he is.

25:58.266 --> 26:00.226
He's just now starting
to find his feet.

26:00.268 --> 26:02.771
And as he gets comfortable
in this situation,

26:02.812 --> 26:04.230
sky's gonna be the limit.

26:04.272 --> 26:06.316
Give it up
for Benny Weag!

26:06.358 --> 26:08.193
Great job, Benny.

26:08.234 --> 26:10.862
You did a great job.
Good luck, Benny.

26:10.904 --> 26:13.823
[ Cheers and applause ]

26:13.865 --> 26:15.700
So far,
I'm excited about my team, man.

26:15.742 --> 26:17.160
There's so much talent.

26:17.202 --> 26:19.037
I'm starting to see that
this is maybe

26:19.079 --> 26:20.914
the strongest bunch
we've ever had.

26:20.955 --> 26:24.542
* Say you'll see me again
even if it's just in *

26:24.584 --> 26:27.796
* Your wildest dreams *

26:27.837 --> 26:31.341
* Ahh-ahh *

26:31.383 --> 26:34.928
I think we could really see
the contrast in the development

26:34.969 --> 26:37.097
and the experience singing.

26:37.138 --> 26:38.848
The winner of this Battle
is Eva.

26:38.890 --> 26:40.892
Thank you so much.
Eva Ullmann!

26:40.934 --> 26:42.352
Blake:
I was really surprised with Eva.

26:42.394 --> 26:44.354
She's doing the right thing.
She's got a great voice.

26:44.396 --> 26:47.190
She's ready for this.
And this is her moment.

26:47.232 --> 26:50.235
* Even though
we're going through it *

26:50.276 --> 26:53.029
* And it makes you
feel alone *

26:53.071 --> 26:56.741
* Just know that
I would die for you *

26:56.783 --> 27:00.203
* Baby, I would die
for you, ohh *

27:00.245 --> 27:03.623
Morgan, I do believe you were
a bit more confident.

27:03.665 --> 27:05.709
And your tone
is really just strong

27:05.750 --> 27:07.836
and powerful
and beautiful.

27:07.877 --> 27:09.379
The winner of this battle
is Morgan.

27:09.421 --> 27:11.047
Daly: Morgan Taylor!
Congratulations.

27:11.089 --> 27:12.799
John: The Battles
are going amazingly.

27:12.841 --> 27:16.344
I love my team, but I also love
some of the other artists, too.

27:16.386 --> 27:21.766
Both:
* H-o-o-o-ome *

27:21.808 --> 27:24.060
* It'll all be alright *

27:24.102 --> 27:25.895
* Be home tonight *

27:25.937 --> 27:29.649
* I'm coming back home *

27:29.691 --> 27:33.361
Daysia, I was just so amazed
with how much you've grown,

27:33.403 --> 27:35.822
and your spirit
is incredible.

27:35.864 --> 27:37.073
God, this is
a really hard one for me,

27:37.115 --> 27:39.784
but the winner of
this battle is Daysia.

27:39.826 --> 27:42.746
Daysia moving on
to the Knockouts.

27:42.787 --> 27:44.414
Daysia, she has
some growing to do,

27:44.456 --> 27:46.708
but she's really
a diamond in the rough.

27:46.750 --> 27:48.043
Her voice can do so much.

27:48.084 --> 27:49.461
Daysia's special.

27:49.502 --> 27:50.962
She's such an old soul.

27:51.004 --> 27:54.591
I am so inspired by the talent
we have this season.

27:54.632 --> 27:56.176
I'm seeing artists step up

27:56.217 --> 27:58.470
in ways that I didn't
necessarily expect.

27:58.511 --> 28:02.015
So I'm gonna try to use
my steal and my save wisely.

28:08.688 --> 28:10.106
* This is "The Voice" *

28:10.148 --> 28:12.734
Daly: Welcome back
to the Battle Rounds.

28:12.776 --> 28:16.279
**

28:16.321 --> 28:18.990
The theme of this Battle
is "Maryland."

28:19.032 --> 28:20.492
The singing sisters
the Marilynds,

28:20.533 --> 28:22.243
they're originally
from Maryland,

28:22.285 --> 28:24.788
and then Parijita
is from Baltimore.

28:24.829 --> 28:27.999
Parijita is,
I think, only 17.
Oh, baby!

28:28.041 --> 28:30.126
And she just carries herself
so maturely.

28:30.168 --> 28:32.962
The Marilynds are this
wonderful duo of sisters.

28:33.004 --> 28:34.923
They do pop and country.

28:34.964 --> 28:37.217
I'm ready to hear it.
Here we go.

28:37.258 --> 28:38.843

28:38.885 --> 28:39.969
Oh, my...
[ Squeals ]

28:40.011 --> 28:42.681
Hello.
Look who's here.

28:42.722 --> 28:43.932
Jazmine: Hello.

28:43.973 --> 28:45.225
They're excited
to see you.

28:45.266 --> 28:47.352
Oh, my gosh.
Parijita's excited.

28:47.394 --> 28:49.187
Parijita:
I am over the moon.

28:49.229 --> 28:51.314
The fact that I just met
Jazmine Sullivan,

28:51.356 --> 28:54.192
who is, like,
an R&B absolute icon?

28:54.234 --> 28:56.111
I am absolutely blown away.

28:56.152 --> 28:57.529
John: Meet
Jazmine Sullivan.

28:57.570 --> 29:00.031
Being able to work
with, like, the best artists

29:00.073 --> 29:02.951
in the business
is such an honor.

29:02.992 --> 29:05.995
[ Chuckles ]
It's not real. But it is real.

29:06.037 --> 29:08.206
We're singing
for Jazmine and John.

29:08.248 --> 29:09.457
John: Oh, please.

29:09.499 --> 29:11.668
I'm just as nervous
as you guys are. Please.

29:11.710 --> 29:13.253
[ Laughter ]

29:13.294 --> 29:15.338
So what did you think
about this song choice?

29:15.380 --> 29:17.215
"How Deep Is Your Love."
You guys into it?

29:17.257 --> 29:19.551
Our mom is a huge fan
of the Bee Gees,

29:19.592 --> 29:21.469
so we grew up listening
to the Bee Gees.

29:21.511 --> 29:24.014
Oh, cool. I feel like
this is a good blend

29:24.055 --> 29:25.557
of the genres.

29:25.598 --> 29:29.227
It's pop, but it's also soul.
And the harmonies.

29:29.269 --> 29:31.354
I think it's just a perfect song
for all three of you

29:31.396 --> 29:32.897
to do together.
Yeah.

29:32.939 --> 29:34.607
The song that we're singing
is "How Deep Is Your Love"

29:34.649 --> 29:36.067
by the Bee Gees.

29:36.109 --> 29:37.444
We were so excited to see
some of the similarities

29:37.485 --> 29:40.321
of their relationship
as brothers.

29:40.363 --> 29:44.242
We both have been through
our fair share of hardships.

29:44.284 --> 29:47.162
We struggled with
eating disorders at one point.

29:47.203 --> 29:49.664
The only reason we've been
able to get through

29:49.706 --> 29:54.252
these hard times is this bond
that we have with each other.

29:54.294 --> 29:56.504
The support from my family
was everything.

29:56.546 --> 29:58.131
[Voice breaking]
Those are the things

29:58.173 --> 30:00.675
that you're just so grateful
and happy now.

30:02.886 --> 30:05.055
Sorry.
[ Laughs ]

30:05.096 --> 30:07.265
* What if I'm trying *

30:07.307 --> 30:08.641
It's taken us a while

30:08.683 --> 30:12.562
to have that blind-audition
moment sink in.

30:12.604 --> 30:14.939
* Lost in that last goodbye *

30:14.981 --> 30:16.941
I would be a great coach
for you.

30:16.983 --> 30:19.861
And --
No, John! John, no!

30:19.903 --> 30:21.279
[ Laughter ]

30:21.321 --> 30:23.114
I have no doubt
in my mind...

30:23.156 --> 30:25.658
If we're putting spotlights
over here, I'm just
gonna stand in it.

30:25.700 --> 30:27.035
John.
Team John.

30:27.077 --> 30:29.996
We've been singing since
we were little girls,

30:30.038 --> 30:32.040
and this is, like,
the moment, you know,

30:32.082 --> 30:34.292
that we've been
working so hard for.

30:34.334 --> 30:38.755
* I know your eyes in the
morning sun, I feel... *

30:38.797 --> 30:41.341
Jazmine: Parijita had
a beautiful, beautiful tone.

30:41.383 --> 30:44.135
And I can hear her in five years

30:44.177 --> 30:46.137
when she, like,
really steps into her voice,

30:46.179 --> 30:48.014
and it's just gonna be
even more amazing.

30:48.056 --> 30:49.808
That's a great part
of this process,

30:49.849 --> 30:51.142
is seeing somebody so young

30:51.184 --> 30:52.936
and just, like,
seeing their potential.

30:52.977 --> 30:57.982
Both: * And you come to me on a
summer breeze, keep me warm... *

30:58.024 --> 30:59.609
Jazmine:
The Marilynds were great.

30:59.651 --> 31:04.114
There's nothing better
than when siblings harmonize.

31:04.155 --> 31:06.366
It's like a blend
that you cannot duplicate.

31:06.408 --> 31:12.080
All:
* We belong to you and me *

31:12.122 --> 31:14.541
I loved it.
I love your tone.
Thank you.

31:14.582 --> 31:17.752
But, also, when you mess up,
don't let us know.
Okay.

31:17.794 --> 31:20.964
I mess up a lot. All the time.
[ Laughs ]
John: Hard to believe.

31:21.006 --> 31:22.590
You won't know
because I'm kind of

31:22.632 --> 31:24.509
just singing through it,
so just try not

31:24.551 --> 31:26.094
to let it read on your face.

31:26.136 --> 31:28.054
I'm more worried about what the
words are instead of letting --

31:28.096 --> 31:29.764
intuitively know
what I'm going to sing.

31:29.806 --> 31:31.057
So, yeah.

31:31.099 --> 31:32.642
It's gonna be about
internalizing it

31:32.684 --> 31:34.352
so it's not even a thought.
Right.

31:34.394 --> 31:36.104
There are a couple of parts
that you're harmonizing

31:36.146 --> 31:39.441
that don't feel like they lend
themselves to harmony that well.

31:39.482 --> 31:42.152
* Come to me
like a summer breeze *

31:42.193 --> 31:43.695
I think that doesn't
need a harmony.

31:43.737 --> 31:45.321
I think that can be
just solo.

31:45.363 --> 31:47.657
Okay. Any tips for, like,
how to calm nerves

31:47.699 --> 31:49.701
right before
the big performance?

31:49.743 --> 31:51.703
Drink Henny. Psyche.
[ Laughter ]

31:51.745 --> 31:53.788
A shot.
A little
brown liquor.

31:53.830 --> 31:55.165
I'm fully a minor.

31:55.206 --> 31:56.833
She's joking
but not joking.

31:56.875 --> 32:02.547
* It's closer
than my hands have been *

32:02.589 --> 32:04.424
* Oh, I'm jealous of the rain *

32:04.466 --> 32:06.051
John:
Sing that song, girl!

32:06.092 --> 32:08.011
Parijita:
I could have never imagined

32:08.053 --> 32:10.055
that I was gonna get
four chairs.

32:10.096 --> 32:12.432
[ Cheering ]
Yes!

32:12.474 --> 32:14.225
I'm actually the first
Nepalese American

32:14.267 --> 32:15.560
to ever audition
on "The Voice."

32:15.602 --> 32:16.895
Yeah, baby!
So I'm very excited!

32:16.936 --> 32:19.773
I know a coach up here
that would be very good.

32:19.814 --> 32:21.691
John!
Yeah!

32:21.733 --> 32:24.569
Choosing John was
the perfect decision for me.

32:24.611 --> 32:26.237
I'm really happy.

32:26.279 --> 32:29.866
* I know your eyes
in the morning sun *

32:29.908 --> 32:33.912
"How Deep Is Your Love"
is just such an emotional song.

32:33.953 --> 32:37.957
The song reminds me that love
is about connection.

32:37.999 --> 32:42.420
Growing up, I didn't look like
my friends at school.

32:42.462 --> 32:45.590
Not having representation
of other brown people

32:45.632 --> 32:48.134
made me feel like
I couldn't be loved.

32:48.176 --> 32:51.846
And so the song makes me
want to believe in love.

32:51.888 --> 32:53.306
It's really beautiful.

32:53.348 --> 32:58.770
All:
* How deep is your love *

32:58.812 --> 33:01.439
It was cool up until the end,
and then you kind of hear

33:01.481 --> 33:04.234
where it starts to fall apart
as you guys come together

33:04.275 --> 33:06.611
because you guys are used to
singing together, you're not.

33:06.653 --> 33:08.822
So you guys have to really
make sure that you practice.

33:08.863 --> 33:11.074
Let's just tighten that
arrangement right now

33:11.116 --> 33:12.826
so that you feel
super comfortable.

33:12.867 --> 33:18.289
All:
* We belong to you and me *

33:18.331 --> 33:21.918
* Belong to you and me,
to and me *

33:21.960 --> 33:24.421
Okay.
Make sure you do "to you"
up on the same note

33:24.462 --> 33:25.797
then go down.
Okay. Perfect.

33:25.839 --> 33:27.716
What is the last
"how deep is your love"?

33:27.757 --> 33:31.970
All:
* How deep is your love *

33:32.012 --> 33:33.304
Cool.

33:33.346 --> 33:34.723
That was a lot better.
That was great.

33:34.764 --> 33:36.349
And then if you guys
look at each other

33:36.391 --> 33:38.143
during that part,
you know, you guys...

33:38.184 --> 33:39.394
Yes, as a threesome.
As a threesome.

33:39.436 --> 33:40.979
By that point,
it's a threesome.

33:41.021 --> 33:43.606
John: With Parijita, her key
is going to be figuring out

33:43.648 --> 33:45.275
how to fit in
with the other two,

33:45.316 --> 33:47.235
because in this
Battle situation,

33:47.277 --> 33:49.195
you've got to kind of
change your M.O.

33:49.237 --> 33:51.531
just a little bit
and be a good team player.

33:51.573 --> 33:53.158
Great to see you all.

33:53.199 --> 33:54.701
And then I think,
with the Marilynds,

33:54.743 --> 33:56.494
this will be right
on their home turf.

33:56.536 --> 33:58.538
The Bee Gees were siblings
that sang together.

33:58.580 --> 34:00.623
The Marilynds are siblings
that sing together.

34:00.665 --> 34:02.667
So I think it's just
about execution for them.

34:02.709 --> 34:04.669
You can tell the sisters
are so used to sitting together

34:04.711 --> 34:07.339
and then it's hard for them
to incorporate a third.

34:07.380 --> 34:08.673
Yeah, I'm like that,
though, because

34:08.715 --> 34:09.924
I'm used to singing
by myself.

34:09.966 --> 34:11.551
So when I'm thinking about
where I have to sing

34:11.593 --> 34:13.303
with other people,
it's hard for me,

34:13.345 --> 34:16.431
so I have to,
like, practice.
Yeah.

34:23.021 --> 34:24.189
* This is "The Voice" *

38:21.634 --> 38:23.678
of your voice
at such a young age.

38:23.720 --> 38:27.932
It seems effortless,
and you have a gorgeous voice.

38:27.974 --> 38:29.434
Thank you so much,
Camila.

38:29.476 --> 38:30.769
Good luck, buddy!

38:30.810 --> 38:33.438
They do dock your pay
if you don't say...

38:33.480 --> 38:34.898
What?
I'm just kidding.

38:34.939 --> 38:37.692
[ Laughter ]

38:37.734 --> 38:40.278
Marilynds, I saw so much more
talent than I thought

38:40.320 --> 38:43.531
the first time that I saw you
sitting up here in the blinds.

38:43.573 --> 38:45.617
Your voices are so different
from each other.

38:45.658 --> 38:47.869
I mean, you have a sharper
voice, hers is warmer,

38:47.911 --> 38:50.246
and they blend really well
together in the harmonies.

38:50.288 --> 38:52.874
Parijita, your personality
was coming out,

38:52.916 --> 38:54.751
and it was
really beautiful.

38:54.793 --> 38:56.252
It's so unique.

38:56.294 --> 38:59.964
It reminds me a lot of a '70s
singer-songwriter voice,

39:00.006 --> 39:02.342
and I love it.

39:02.384 --> 39:03.802
Daly:
Thank you, Coaches!

39:03.843 --> 39:05.804
[ Cheers and applause ]

39:05.845 --> 39:07.263
Alright, John,
you got the final decision.

39:07.305 --> 39:08.598
Give us some thoughts first.

39:08.640 --> 39:11.226
One of the things
that I was worried about

39:11.267 --> 39:13.645
was whether or not Parijita

39:13.687 --> 39:16.648
would find a way to fit in
with the two of you.

39:16.690 --> 39:19.651
And I really felt you all
found a way to connect

39:19.693 --> 39:21.736
with each other as a trio.

39:21.778 --> 39:25.240
Marilynds, you all just leaned
into those harmonies.

39:25.281 --> 39:26.616
It was flawless.

39:26.658 --> 39:28.993
The quality
of your execution today,

39:29.035 --> 39:31.663
it was just
really, really strong.

39:31.705 --> 39:33.331
Thank you.
Thank you, John.

39:33.373 --> 39:36.501
Parijita, there's something
where you just feel like

39:36.543 --> 39:38.294
you're connected
to who you are.

39:38.336 --> 39:42.632
And it's just amazing that
that amount of self-awareness,

39:42.674 --> 39:47.554
self-knowledge, self-possession
is coming from someone so young.

39:47.595 --> 39:49.681
And your voice
is just phenomenal.

39:49.723 --> 39:52.267
It just feels so inviting.

39:52.308 --> 39:55.186
John, who is the winner
of this Battle?

39:55.228 --> 39:56.563
**

39:56.604 --> 39:59.190
This is gonna be
really hard for you.

39:59.232 --> 40:01.026
I agree. It's hard.

40:01.067 --> 40:04.029
You pick, Carson!
You pick!

40:18.835 --> 40:21.046
Daly: Parijita!
Congratulations!

40:21.087 --> 40:24.257
You're moving on
to the Knockouts!

40:24.299 --> 40:28.386
Parijita was beloved by all
the coaches in the blinds,

40:28.428 --> 40:29.846
and she showed us why.

40:29.888 --> 40:31.306
Oh, my God.
Thank you.

40:31.348 --> 40:32.557
Beautiful. Beautiful.

40:32.599 --> 40:34.059
She has such a lovely tone

40:34.100 --> 40:37.896
and so mature
and open and beautiful

40:37.937 --> 40:40.857
and has such
a magical presence.

40:40.899 --> 40:43.401
So I had to pick Parijita.

40:43.443 --> 40:46.029
[ Laughs ] Hi!

40:46.071 --> 40:49.657
[ Laughter ]

40:49.699 --> 40:52.410
...Mom.

40:52.452 --> 40:54.746
Coaches, I want to remind you
that the Marilynds

40:54.788 --> 40:56.206
are available
to steal or save.

40:56.247 --> 40:58.625
Anything you guys want to say
to your coach?

40:58.667 --> 41:01.252
John, it's been a pleasure
to work with you.

41:01.294 --> 41:05.590
Daly: Whoa!
That's the sound of a save!

41:05.632 --> 41:07.759
[ Parijita shrieks ]

41:07.801 --> 41:10.011
Daly:
They are back in business!

41:10.053 --> 41:11.888
Whoa!

41:11.930 --> 41:14.391
John: The Marilynds deserved
to be saved, and I think

41:14.432 --> 41:16.226
they have something special
to offer this competition.

41:16.267 --> 41:17.936
That was so great.
Thank you, John.

41:17.977 --> 41:19.688
John:
They're a very compelling group.

41:19.729 --> 41:22.607
And I think their lane
of country pop

41:22.649 --> 41:24.109
is unique on my team.

41:24.150 --> 41:26.277
I think they're going to do
something really special

41:26.319 --> 41:28.113
as they go forward.

41:28.154 --> 41:30.990
Oh, my God. I'm so excited
that we get to continue on.

41:31.032 --> 41:32.784
I'm just --
I'm just thrilled.

41:32.826 --> 41:34.577
So just --
just being able to --

41:34.619 --> 41:36.454
How do you feel
about John Legend?

41:36.496 --> 41:37.789
[ Laughter ]

41:37.831 --> 41:38.873
John, we love you!
Just wanna squeeze him.

41:38.915 --> 41:40.291
Welcome home.

41:40.333 --> 41:43.169
I've seen bananas go
from green to yellow

41:43.211 --> 41:45.088
in the amount of time
you took.

41:45.130 --> 41:48.299
I took a long time. I was
indecisive that time.

41:48.341 --> 41:50.135
Sorry. [ Laughs ]

41:50.176 --> 41:52.429
Well, you need those bananas
to turn yellow, so...

41:52.470 --> 41:54.180
That's right. That's right.
That's what I'm here for.

41:54.222 --> 41:55.932
You're letting them
get ripe up there.
Yes.

41:55.974 --> 41:58.768
You want them brown for your
banana bread, then let me know.

41:58.810 --> 42:00.770
Blake: Oh, yeah.
