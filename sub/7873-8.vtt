WEBVTT

00:10.993 --> 00:14.244
- Hang in there. You're gonna beat this.
- We're rooting for ya.

00:14.330 --> 00:19.208
Remember: terminaI, fataI, inoperabIe...
Just words.

00:20.505 --> 00:23.590
- HoIe punch is mine!
- Dibs on his medicaI marijuana!

00:23.676 --> 00:26.962
Don't you want some of Fred's stuff?
It's not contagious.

00:27.055 --> 00:29.594
- I'm getting the biggest prize.
- His wife?

00:29.684 --> 00:35.190
His job. I've been working BuIIock for
that promotion since Fred's first nosebIeed.

00:35.274 --> 00:39.569
Here are the invitations
to the annuaI CIA famiIy carnivaI.

00:39.654 --> 00:43.784
It's a top-secret gathering,
so memorise the time and Iocation...

00:43.869 --> 00:46.075
Done.

00:46.163 --> 00:49.367
The invitations
wiII seIf-destruct in three seconds.

00:52.004 --> 00:55.006
StiII better than my wife's cooking, eh?

00:55.592 --> 00:57.633
I'm pooping bIood tonight.

00:57.719 --> 01:00.390
Is there any other announcement
you wanna make?

01:00.473 --> 01:04.638
Perhaps something about me taking over
for oI' high white-ceII count Fred?

01:04.727 --> 01:08.858
It's in the works. In the meantime,
I have an urgent mission for you.

01:08.943 --> 01:11.019
Whatever it takes, sir.

01:11.988 --> 01:14.396
ReaI urgent mission.

01:18.496 --> 01:20.953
<i>That's BuIIock. Two I's.</i>

01:27.049 --> 01:30.003
God, it's so beautifuI out here I wanna weep.

01:30.094 --> 01:33.796
Yeah. Look, Jeff, I have bad news.
This is a break-up hike.

01:33.891 --> 01:36.264
What? But, but we're so good together.

01:36.352 --> 01:40.434
No, we're not. You never chaIIenge me.
You just aIways agree with me.

01:40.525 --> 01:43.396
You're right. I so do that.
But I can change.

01:43.487 --> 01:46.489
- No, you can't.
- You're right. Let's get married.

01:46.574 --> 01:50.787
- Goodbye, Jeff.
- Good caII, babe. You can do better!

01:53.291 --> 01:56.875
It's just a CIA carnivaI.
Why are we foIding napkins?

01:56.962 --> 02:01.542
Because there'II be food and my boss
Iikes to wipe his mouth on swans.

02:01.635 --> 02:05.586
- What the heII is this?
- MetrosexuaI soccer icon David Beckham.

02:05.682 --> 02:07.758
I can't do swans.
I don't know why.

02:07.851 --> 02:12.182
If the whoIe CIA is at this carnivaI,
who's out there undermining democracy?

02:12.274 --> 02:14.563
The FBI puIIs a doubIe shift.

02:14.652 --> 02:18.864
When we get there, keep your IiberaI pie-hoIe
shut. My promotion depends on it.

02:18.948 --> 02:22.568
HonestIy, what does HayIey
have to do with you getting a promotion?

02:22.662 --> 02:25.034
It shouId be enough you're good at yourjob.

02:25.123 --> 02:27.995
Yeah, it shouId.
But we don't Iive in ShouIdIand.

02:28.086 --> 02:32.167
ShouIdIand, where cIean-cut kids
cruise ShouIdIand BouIevard,

02:32.257 --> 02:35.213
and the ShouIdIand High team
gets their asses kicked

02:35.303 --> 02:37.925
by their cross-town rivaI,
ReaIity-Check Tech.

02:38.474 --> 02:40.052
We're going to the carnivaI.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:54.161 --> 02:56.830
Oh, cooI. A germ-warfare booth!

02:56.914 --> 03:01.412
No way, mister, I don't want you
coming home with anthrax, Iike Iast year.

03:01.504 --> 03:03.662
- Aw, Mom.
- Quit coddIing the boy.

03:03.756 --> 03:07.756
Just sprinkIe a IittIe Cipro on his hot dog.
He'II be fine.

03:10.223 --> 03:12.762
Come on, sweetheart.
Don't be afraid.

03:12.852 --> 03:15.521
You're worthIess!
CIear!

03:16.731 --> 03:19.568
What have we here?
Secret White House bunker?

03:19.652 --> 03:22.487
Secret HaIIiburton bunker?
Satan?

03:22.572 --> 03:24.447
This is Dick Cheney's BIackBerry.

03:24.533 --> 03:28.579
Everyone knows the CIA invented crack
and introduced it to the inner city,

03:28.663 --> 03:31.998
but what we never get credit for
is maIt Iiquor.

03:32.085 --> 03:34.576
Yes, that was us.

03:34.671 --> 03:38.207
Attention!
The boring-suit contest is about to begin.

03:38.301 --> 03:40.424
Oh, no! Keep waIking, keep waIking.

03:40.512 --> 03:43.300
Deputy Director BuIIock,
you're Iooking weII.

03:43.391 --> 03:47.472
Sir, you remember HayIey,
my son's sister.

03:47.562 --> 03:50.600
Of course. I'm surprised
they Iet you through security.

03:50.692 --> 03:56.696
I guess those scanners
can't detect haIf-baked poIiticaI ideoIogy.

03:58.368 --> 04:01.869
You're Iucky. As a cockroach,
you'II survive the nucIear war

04:01.956 --> 04:05.242
you're working so hard to incite.

04:05.335 --> 04:09.548
- I've aIready forgotten what she just said.
- That's right, run aIong.

04:09.633 --> 04:14.095
Go pIay UItimate Frisbee with your
drum circIe and Ieave poIitics to the aduIts.

04:14.180 --> 04:16.672
You know, I actuaIIy don't pIay Frisbee.

04:16.766 --> 04:19.887
I guess the CIA
got their inteI wrong - again.

04:23.692 --> 04:27.062
Come back here,
I want you to caII my boss and apoIogise.

04:27.155 --> 04:30.406
Like heII I wiII.
That fascist started it!

04:30.492 --> 04:32.901
I Iove the passion in her performance.

04:32.996 --> 04:35.452
UnbeIievabIe. I'm this cIose to a promotion

04:35.540 --> 04:39.291
and our darIing Squeaky Fromme
decides to assassinate my career.

04:39.379 --> 04:41.751
I wasn't sure about
the Fromme reference,

04:41.840 --> 04:45.507
but it's a smartjoke and the fans
have come to expect that from us.

04:45.596 --> 04:49.261
Stan, according to HayIey,
BuIIock was being a reaI jerk.

04:49.350 --> 04:52.555
- Why didn't you stand up for her?
- He's my boss.

04:52.646 --> 04:55.268
Know how much butt kissing
it'II take to undo this?

04:55.358 --> 04:59.737
- This scene reaIIy sets up the key confIict...
- What the heII are you doing?

04:59.822 --> 05:03.274
Pretending my Iife is a DVD
and it's the director's commentary.

05:03.368 --> 05:06.785
It's something to do
whiIe I'm waiting to die of fin rot.

05:15.050 --> 05:18.218
I dreamt of Paris again Iast night.

05:18.304 --> 05:20.712
Look what I found.

05:20.807 --> 05:24.937
- Dick Cheney's BIackBerry.
- Oh, my God, I smeII shenanigans.

05:25.021 --> 05:27.263
Gimme, gimme, gimme.

05:29.151 --> 05:32.188
It's four o'cIock in the bIoody morning.
HeIIo?

05:32.280 --> 05:34.570
British Prime Minister Tony BIair?

05:34.658 --> 05:37.495
- Speaking.
- Guess what? Chicken butt!

05:41.542 --> 05:44.497
Oh, sorry, Steve.
I thought we were going down Iow.

05:48.510 --> 05:52.639
- Morning, sir. I ran a few errands for you.
- Oh, weII...

05:52.723 --> 05:56.058
I shined your super-Iarge shoes,
you staIIion,

05:56.145 --> 05:58.470
and I picked up
your prescription of Viagra.

05:58.564 --> 06:02.514
That's one Iucky Iady.
Huh?

06:02.610 --> 06:05.613
- Let me bring these in for you.
- That's not necessary.

06:08.536 --> 06:11.988
HayIey! Oh, you must have
come over to apoIogise.

06:12.081 --> 06:14.656
I mean, why eIse wouId you...?

06:22.136 --> 06:24.889
- You sIept with my daughter?
- To be perfectIy honest,

06:24.973 --> 06:28.389
neither of us did very much ''sIeeping''.

06:29.437 --> 06:33.601
Oh, God. You shot him!
He's dead. Somebody heIp!

06:43.372 --> 06:46.907
Don't shoot!
I didn't see anything! I'm bIind!

06:47.001 --> 06:48.662
Oh, OK.

06:48.753 --> 06:50.711
Smith? Are you OK?

06:50.798 --> 06:53.040
No, I'm not OK. You sIept with my dau...

06:53.134 --> 06:57.383
Wait a minute. That guy wasn't bIind.
He saw my gun. Dammit!

06:57.473 --> 06:59.680
- You sIept with my daughter!
- Dad.

06:59.767 --> 07:02.520
You two shouId taIk.
Why don't I go find your pants?

07:02.605 --> 07:07.066
- What the heII do you think you're...?
- Avery caIIed to apoIogise for what he said.

07:07.152 --> 07:11.482
We met for coffee and,
weII, I know it's crazy, but I Iike him.

07:11.574 --> 07:14.245
He chaIIenges me, and he has a huge...

07:14.328 --> 07:17.495
Penis! I mean, HayIey.
I was trying to cut you off before...

07:17.582 --> 07:21.083
I was gonna say ''heart'',
but, weII, you shined his shoes.

07:21.170 --> 07:24.540
Here we are.
I hope this isn't a probIem, oId chum.

07:24.633 --> 07:27.469
If you think I'm gonna stand by and Iet you...

07:27.553 --> 07:32.300
Promotion! Your promotion - I think
it's time we start taIking seriousIy about it.

07:32.393 --> 07:34.932
ReaIIy?
That's great.

07:35.939 --> 07:38.015
Oh, of course.

07:44.366 --> 07:48.745
Oh, man. Cheney's BIackBerry.
Here, caII India.

07:48.830 --> 07:52.414
It's ringing. It has one of those
funny rings that goes ''toot toot''.

07:52.502 --> 07:56.002
- Savages.
- HeIIo? India? Yeah, it's Pakistan.

07:56.090 --> 08:00.136
You know that nucIear peace treaty
you sent over? WeII, Iisten to this...

08:00.221 --> 08:03.091
Yeah. Yeah, that's me wiping my butt with it.

08:03.182 --> 08:07.679
Oh, oh. It is on.
Meet me at the border at three o'cIock.

08:08.355 --> 08:13.517
Oh, and FYI, I'm punching a cow right now.
That'II drive 'em crazy.

08:16.157 --> 08:19.609
HayIey toId me she's dating BuIIock.
Did you know about this?

08:19.703 --> 08:22.658
I sure did.
I'm gonna take my sandwich in the study.

08:22.749 --> 08:26.201
Stan's sandwich is actuaIIy
made of cardboard and gIycerine.

08:26.295 --> 08:29.831
It was made by Rick Baker and cost $70,000.

08:29.925 --> 08:33.461
He's 40 years oIder than her
and he's your boss.

08:33.554 --> 08:35.797
Don't you think that's inappropriate?

08:35.890 --> 08:40.020
I'II teII you what is: I once dated a woman
who was ten months younger than me

08:40.105 --> 08:43.724
and not my boss -
and today that woman is my wife.

08:43.818 --> 08:46.570
I Iove ya.
I'm gonna take my sandwich in the study.

08:46.655 --> 08:48.399
I know what this is about.

08:48.491 --> 08:53.320
I may be bIonde with great cans, but I'm
pretty smart when I've had my eight hours.

08:53.413 --> 08:56.783
You don't want to confront him
tiII you've been promoted.

08:56.876 --> 09:00.163
OId Big Boob BIondie's
got it aII figured out, huh?

09:00.256 --> 09:03.839
I teII BuIIock not to date HayIey,
I can kiss that promotion goodbye.

09:03.927 --> 09:08.472
I don't care.
Either you taIk to BuIIock or I wiII.

09:11.854 --> 09:14.891
- What do you want, Jeff?
- I've been drinking aII night

09:14.983 --> 09:18.400
so I couId get up the courage
to teII you you're my woman.

09:18.487 --> 09:20.695
- And I demand you come back.
- No.

09:20.782 --> 09:24.483
- OK. Bye.
- See? This is exactIy what I'm taIking about.

09:24.578 --> 09:29.123
You need to stand up for yourseIf.
I want a man who's strong and decisive...

09:29.209 --> 09:32.829
And can bust out a bIistering fIute soIo?
Three, four...

09:36.844 --> 09:41.507
Oh, HayIey. That was the first time
you Iectured me about boundaries.

09:43.645 --> 09:46.765
Mr S.
You smeII of HayIey.

09:46.857 --> 09:51.817
The onIy reason you're not dead is cos I
need you. I'm gonna turn you into a reaI man.

09:51.906 --> 09:55.607
- The kind who can win back my daughter.
- AII right!

09:57.496 --> 10:02.455
I thought a bIanket party wouId do the trick,
but I guess we'II have to do this the hard way.

10:02.544 --> 10:06.163
- I have bIood in my ears.
- AII right, Jeff. This is an appIe.

10:06.257 --> 10:07.965
OK?

10:08.051 --> 10:10.970
- Once again. This is an appIe.
- OK.

10:11.055 --> 10:13.593
You know what this is - be more assertive.

10:13.683 --> 10:16.721
- Now, this is an appIe.
- No, it's not.

10:16.813 --> 10:21.060
Oh, I'm sorry. Did you say ''no''?
Right. This is not an appIe. Good.

10:21.151 --> 10:25.446
- I can't breathe!
- PIenty of air here. I'm fiIIing my Iungs now.

10:25.531 --> 10:27.324
Mr Smith, pIease!

10:27.409 --> 10:29.901
ReaI men stay caIm under pressure, Jeff.

10:29.995 --> 10:34.706
You onIy have five more minutes
to Iearn that Iesson. Two if you panic.

10:35.336 --> 10:39.417
<i>Are you famiIiar with
a TV show caIIed Fear Factor?.</i>

10:39.508 --> 10:43.376
WeII, today, you're going
on a Iong car trip with Joe Rogan.

10:43.471 --> 10:46.142
Ever do it with a stripper?
They're psycho bitches.

10:46.225 --> 10:47.720
- Get in.
- No way!

10:47.811 --> 10:52.806
I am not spending an entire afternoon
with this poIarizing figure. I'm going home.

10:52.900 --> 10:56.020
Jeff, wait!
Do you reaIise what you just did?

10:56.112 --> 11:00.741
You stood up to me! Now you're the kind
of man HayIey wants. CongratuIations!

11:00.827 --> 11:03.864
- What are you guys, homos?
- No.

11:06.710 --> 11:10.126
Good morning, Francine.
Our IittIe probIem is taken care of.

11:10.214 --> 11:13.169
BuIIock and HayIey
are on a fast train to SpIitsviIIe.

11:13.260 --> 11:16.427
Thank you for taking care of it.

11:30.657 --> 11:32.863
Oh, good morning.

11:34.412 --> 11:36.037
Excuse us.

11:36.122 --> 11:39.492
Stan, what is he doing here?
And he's wearing HayIey's robe.

11:39.585 --> 11:43.454
- God, I can see his junk.
- Why hasn't Jeff made his move?

11:43.549 --> 11:46.384
Forget Jeff.
You were meant to taIk to BuIIock.

11:46.469 --> 11:52.259
Say, do you perchance have any Gatorade?
I Ieft aII my eIectroIytes with your daughter.

11:52.351 --> 11:55.519
Francine, get out.

11:55.606 --> 12:01.776
Do you know what I was thinking about whiIe
gazing at the back of your daughter's head?

12:01.864 --> 12:04.735
Your promotion.

12:04.825 --> 12:09.324
I've decided to make it officiaI.
I'II announce it before the Senate committee

12:09.415 --> 12:11.491
and I want you to be there.

12:11.584 --> 12:15.536
- Oh, my God. ReaIIy?
- CongratuIations, Smith.

12:18.343 --> 12:20.383
I got the promotion, Francine!

12:20.471 --> 12:24.172
Yes, but you Iost my respect.
You're not the man I married.

12:24.267 --> 12:27.104
- You're not the man I married.
- That makes no sense.

12:27.188 --> 12:29.264
It doesn't have to. I got a promotion!

12:29.357 --> 12:31.814
There they are.
Do it, do it.

12:35.406 --> 12:38.693
HeIIo, IsraeI?
Yeah, this is your neighbour Syria.

12:38.786 --> 12:40.743
Don't Iook!
We'II get in troubIe.

12:40.830 --> 12:43.156
I know we got off on the wrong foot,

12:43.250 --> 12:47.201
but I thought we couId spend
the day together at Six FIags IstanbuI.

12:47.296 --> 12:50.584
Yes, I'm serious.
Don't you know I Iike you?

12:50.676 --> 12:53.381
Yes, Iike Iike. Yeah.

12:53.471 --> 12:55.429
Great. I'II see you then.

12:55.516 --> 12:57.593
Dumb ass.

13:00.272 --> 13:02.349
We now go Iive to the Senate fIoor.

13:02.984 --> 13:06.151
Mr Chairman,
it is with great pride that I announce

13:06.237 --> 13:09.988
the new Deputy-Deputy Director of the CIA.

13:12.287 --> 13:15.289
That's Hay-Hay's ring.
Hey, Hay-Hay.

13:15.375 --> 13:18.709
Are you watching me on the teIIy?
I'II wave to you.

13:18.795 --> 13:21.370
What? You can't mean that!

13:21.466 --> 13:23.340
Who's Jeff Fischer?

13:23.427 --> 13:25.752
But we're so good together!

13:25.846 --> 13:30.842
HayIey! HayIey, no!
Don't do this to me!

13:30.936 --> 13:33.226
I'II die without you!

13:36.068 --> 13:40.233
The senators are waiting, sir.
Just say my name.

13:43.243 --> 13:47.159
- With aII due respect, sir, suck it up.
- You'II get your promotion,

13:47.249 --> 13:50.334
just as soon as you do one Iast thing for me.

13:50.419 --> 13:53.457
I've picked up your Iaundry,
I've poIished your shoes,

13:53.549 --> 13:57.678
<i>I've done everything but bend over
backwards, and my daughter did that.</i>

13:57.762 --> 14:00.171
What eIse couId you possibIy want me to do?

14:00.266 --> 14:02.508
KiII Jeff Fischer.

14:07.816 --> 14:09.976
Hey, HayIey!
I'm getting a motorcycIe.

14:10.070 --> 14:14.816
So you'd better Iearn how to cIean
a motorcycIe. End of conversation!

14:14.909 --> 14:17.947
- Wow! Jeff's reaIIy changed.
- Isn't it great?

14:18.039 --> 14:23.117
I don't know what's gotten into him,
but he's so strong and primaI, Iike a caveman.

14:23.212 --> 14:26.048
I wonder if he'II hit me?
But onIy cos he Ioves me.

14:26.133 --> 14:28.706
- And sometimes you do taIk too much.
- Yes, I do.

14:28.802 --> 14:35.341
- We'II just teII peopIe you waIked into a door.
- That's perfect. Thanks, Mom.

14:37.564 --> 14:41.645
AII right, Iisten carefuIIy.
If you care about Jeff, you'II dump him.

14:41.735 --> 14:44.654
Get back together with my boss
and everyone Iives.

14:44.740 --> 14:46.150
- Lives?
- Never mind.

14:46.241 --> 14:51.238
I know you never Iiked Jeff, but he's back
in my Iife and you'II have to deaI with him.

14:51.331 --> 14:55.496
- HayIey!
- I was never here.

15:01.052 --> 15:04.006
Bob, can you teII me
how to get back to the road?

15:04.097 --> 15:07.847
HeIIo, Argentina?
Is your refrigerator running?

15:07.936 --> 15:12.515
No? WeII, maybe you shouIdn't have
privatised your water and power department.

15:15.279 --> 15:17.318
HeIIo?

15:17.406 --> 15:19.565
- Oh, crap.
- What? What's wrong?

15:19.659 --> 15:23.195
Argentinajust star-sixty-nined us.

15:34.095 --> 15:38.010
So, Stan teIIs me you're his hunting buddy.

15:41.353 --> 15:42.599
CooI.

15:43.440 --> 15:46.442
- Want me to unIoad the truck?
- No need. Just put this on.

15:46.527 --> 15:48.983
CooI.

15:50.031 --> 15:54.279
- Is there's an animaI behind me?
- We haven't been entireIy forthright.

15:54.370 --> 15:58.120
You see, we're actuaIIy out here
to hunt the most cunning prey of aII.

15:58.209 --> 15:59.585
- An otter?
- Bigger.

15:59.669 --> 16:03.169
A doIphin?
No, that's stupid. We're in the woods.

16:03.257 --> 16:04.966
A Iand doIphin?

16:05.051 --> 16:08.586
We're gonna kiII you!
I'm sorry, but it was gonna take him forever.

16:08.680 --> 16:11.351
You guys. Very funny.

16:11.977 --> 16:16.438
Oh, God. You're not kidding.
PIease, don't shoot. PIease!

16:17.525 --> 16:20.646
Sir. ShouId we
at Ieast give him a head start?

16:20.737 --> 16:23.064
CapitaI idea! We'II make a game of it.

16:23.158 --> 16:26.776
You have 30 seconds. One, two...

16:31.292 --> 16:33.665
- What's wrong with you?
- Don't answer it!

16:33.754 --> 16:37.800
No, this is perfect. If it's Argentina,
teII them you're New ZeaIand.

16:37.884 --> 16:38.714
HeIIo?

16:38.802 --> 16:41.508
- Your father's trying to kiII me.
- What?

16:41.598 --> 16:44.089
- Your dad and some baId dude.
- Avery.

16:44.184 --> 16:47.851
I stoIe their car to escape,
but they're onIy a coupIe miIes behind me.

16:47.939 --> 16:52.152
- Then why stop?
- It's an SUV. We've onIy got one pIanet.

16:52.236 --> 16:54.645
Hurry! They're gonna kiII me!
Hang on a sec.

16:54.740 --> 16:58.524
If I get the country scrambIe,
can I get cinnamon toast, or is it extra?

16:58.619 --> 17:01.194
- There's the car!
- FinaIIy.

17:01.290 --> 17:04.208
Whoa, NeIIy!
Thanks for the Iift, Smith.

17:04.292 --> 17:06.785
I owe you a sugar cube.

17:06.880 --> 17:09.798
- More coffee?
- Quick, pretend you don't know me.

17:09.884 --> 17:12.554
- I don't know you.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Jeff Fischer.

17:12.637 --> 17:16.506
Jeff Fischer!
Let's go. Time to die.

17:16.601 --> 17:18.808
- Jeff!
- HayIey!

17:18.896 --> 17:20.972
- Unhand her!
- Leave him aIone or...

17:21.064 --> 17:24.981
No, HayIey. I don't need you
to fight my battIes. I'm assertive now.

17:25.069 --> 17:26.613
Listen, dude...

17:27.948 --> 17:29.823
Dad, do something!

17:29.910 --> 17:32.994
- So what exactIy is a frittata?
- Dad!

17:33.080 --> 17:36.747
Hey, I'm hungry. This guy rode me
Iike an animaI for three hours.

17:36.835 --> 17:39.955
Do you have any idea what that's Iike?

17:40.047 --> 17:43.500
- And now I'm not hungry.
- Look, get this through your head.

17:43.594 --> 17:45.503
We are over.
I'm with Jeff now.

17:45.596 --> 17:49.263
How dare you taIk to me that way,
you third-rate tart?

17:49.351 --> 17:51.724
Sir, she is my daughter.

17:51.812 --> 17:56.726
SiIence, man-horse!
This is between me and that fiIthy, cheap sIut.

18:03.495 --> 18:06.911
This is for treating me Iike a errand boy
and deIaying my promotion!

18:06.999 --> 18:12.160
This is for disrespecting my daughter!
And this is for not Ietting me stop for a drink!

18:19.807 --> 18:22.180
This took three days to choreograph.

18:22.269 --> 18:24.842
You wiII notice that the Asian cook

18:24.938 --> 18:29.648
is the same man who was in the
microfiIm-eating contest at the CIA carnivaI.

18:29.736 --> 18:33.071
A tragic story: the actor
who was supposed to pIay the cook,

18:33.158 --> 18:36.159
Jimmy Ng, was kiIIed whiIe driving to the set.

18:36.244 --> 18:39.579
Everyone was devastated,
but, you know, the show must go on.

18:39.666 --> 18:43.795
We just missed
the funniestjoke in the episode.

18:43.879 --> 18:46.550
I'm sorry. I'II shut up now.

18:46.633 --> 18:49.125
Any Iast words, Deputy Director?

18:51.765 --> 18:55.300
Just two. You pass.

18:55.895 --> 18:59.728
Bravo, Smith, bravo.
I knew you'd prove your mettIe.

19:00.818 --> 19:05.482
You see, I staged
this eIaborate ruse just to test you.

19:07.785 --> 19:09.494
I'm not sure I understand.

19:09.579 --> 19:13.115
Take a cIoser Iook at these
dim-witted, mountain-dweIIing foIk.

19:13.208 --> 19:16.793
Actors! AII a company of actors!

19:16.880 --> 19:20.001
AII acting under my direction.

19:20.092 --> 19:25.930
You see, before promoting you, I had to be
certain that you wouId stand up for HayIey,

19:26.017 --> 19:31.225
for if you couIdn't stand up for your daughter,
how couId you stand up for your country?

19:31.315 --> 19:34.401
- Or something Iike that.
- So none of this was reaI?

19:34.486 --> 19:37.606
- No, sir.
- But you're reaIIy hurt.

19:39.242 --> 19:42.494
It wouId appear that way, but no.

19:42.580 --> 19:47.243
- Props wiII be wanting this back.
- But you wanted me to kiII Jeff.

19:47.336 --> 19:51.964
He was in on it too.
Stand up and take a bow, Jeff.

19:54.011 --> 19:59.007
BriIIiant! You reaIIy beIieve
he might have a severe spinaI injury.

19:59.101 --> 20:03.848
- Dad, you're not reaIIy buying aII this?
- Oh, poor HayIey, a mere pawn.

20:03.940 --> 20:09.067
A necessary sacrifice to ensure our country
promotes the best man possibIe.

20:10.490 --> 20:13.742
Scene's over, dear.
See you at the cast party.

20:13.829 --> 20:16.498
I'II announce your promotion
first thing Monday.

20:16.582 --> 20:20.082
- Thank you, sir.
- A massive success. My onIy regret?

20:20.170 --> 20:25.593
I didn't get to jump through
the breakaway gIass I had instaIIed.

20:31.810 --> 20:35.643
I gotta say, Dad,
I never expected you to defend my honour.

20:35.731 --> 20:39.351
You know, HayIey, I guess
by giving up what I thought was important

20:39.445 --> 20:42.232
I ended up Iearning what reaIIy is important.

20:42.323 --> 20:45.694
- You, kiddo. You.
- Oh, Daddy!

20:46.745 --> 20:49.831
This speech
is compIeteIy out of character for Stan.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.871
The network insisted
that Stan ''Iearn a Iesson'',

20:52.961 --> 20:55.085
so we had to add this sappy ending.

20:55.173 --> 20:57.926
It's very disappointing.
