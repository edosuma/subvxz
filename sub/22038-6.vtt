00:22.930 --> 00:25.180
(crickets chirping)
(country music playing)

00:25.180 --> 00:30.220
The greatest outlaw
in country music has
to be Waylon Jennings.

00:30.220 --> 00:32.640
I think that'd be pretty hard
to argue with.

00:32.640 --> 00:34.600
The evidence is overwhelming.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.770

01:04.680 --> 01:07.980
The truth is,
there are really two Waylons.

01:07.980 --> 01:10.850
There's the guy
in the black hat,
the honky-tonk hero,

01:10.850 --> 01:13.520
and then there's the kid
with slicked-back hair

01:13.520 --> 01:16.180
who almost broke out with
the birth of rock and roll,

01:16.180 --> 01:18.100
playing bass with Buddy Holly.

01:18.100 --> 01:20.430
And both Waylons
cheated death,

01:20.430 --> 01:23.430
more times than any man
has a right to.

01:23.430 --> 01:25.560
(theme music playing)

01:38.430 --> 01:39.470
Everybody always says,

01:39.470 --> 01:40.470
"Man, when you gonna write

01:40.470 --> 01:41.640
a book about the Waylon years?"

01:41.640 --> 01:42.680
I say, "Not as long

01:42.680 --> 01:43.850
as my mama's alive."

01:43.850 --> 01:45.600
There you go. There you go.

01:45.600 --> 01:48.520
Mike:
Gordon "Crank" Payne
and Jerry "Jigger" Bridges

01:48.520 --> 01:52.770
spent the better part
of their careers on stage
with Waylon Jennings.

01:52.770 --> 01:54.850
Crank played guitar
and harmonica.

01:54.850 --> 01:56.270
Jigger played bass.

01:56.270 --> 01:58.220
Both of them got
their nicknames

01:58.220 --> 02:00.350
from the man they knew as Hoss.

02:00.350 --> 02:01.430
I remember we had

02:01.430 --> 02:02.890
a Canadian tour with Willie,

02:02.890 --> 02:04.730
and Waylon warned Willie,

02:04.730 --> 02:06.850
he said, "You've got
to do something with this bus.

02:06.850 --> 02:08.350
"There's so much pot
that was smoked.

02:08.350 --> 02:09.560
You've got to clean it up."

02:09.560 --> 02:11.430
Tom Bourke:
We were high 24/7.

02:11.430 --> 02:13.310
I don't know how
to tell people that,

02:13.310 --> 02:17.140
but, you know, how do you think
you do 200 dates a year?

02:17.140 --> 02:19.560
You can't unless
you're on something.

02:19.560 --> 02:22.060
(sniffs)
We ran around this country
with a sign on our head.

02:22.060 --> 02:24.310
It said, "Look at us,
we're stupid,"

02:24.310 --> 02:26.520
because we were high
all the time.

02:26.520 --> 02:29.560
Mike: Tom Bourke
was the road manager
for Waylon Jennings

02:29.560 --> 02:31.390
from his start
as a solo artist

02:31.390 --> 02:34.100
to super stardom
as a country music outlaw.

02:34.100 --> 02:36.520
Willie's bus was
in front of Waylon's,

02:36.520 --> 02:38.060
and you could smell the smoke.

02:38.060 --> 02:41.600
So Willie sent it in,
and he had it steam cleaned

02:41.600 --> 02:44.020
and everything that
you could do to the bus,

02:44.020 --> 02:45.850
but it didn't work. (chuckles)

02:45.850 --> 02:47.310
(barking)
We got to the crossing,

02:47.310 --> 02:48.810
the guards,
they came on his bus.

02:48.810 --> 02:51.600
And you know
how dogs sniff around?
This dog sat down.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.270
Just sat there
and just looked around.

02:54.270 --> 02:57.310
He didn't know where
to bark or where to sniff.

02:57.310 --> 02:59.100
He had no idea what to do.

02:59.100 --> 03:01.310
Bourke: And they took
everything out of Willie's bus.
(barking)

03:01.310 --> 03:03.600
They were looking underneath
the bays and everything.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.730
The dogs were
going crazy, you know,

03:05.730 --> 03:07.430
and they couldn't find nothing.

03:07.430 --> 03:10.100
Anyway, they let Willie go,
and he gets away
with everything.

03:10.100 --> 03:12.930
We thought that
after he got through

03:12.930 --> 03:14.930
that it was smooth sailing
for us, you know.

03:14.930 --> 03:17.100
Then when our bus got there,

03:17.100 --> 03:19.890
they took Waylon,
they wanted to do
a strip search.

03:19.890 --> 03:23.270
The funny part at that time is--
there was six of us, I think--

03:23.270 --> 03:25.520
we were honorary
deputy sheriffs,

03:25.520 --> 03:27.350
so when they took us
into the little room,

03:27.350 --> 03:29.140
we just all threw the badges
on the table.

03:29.140 --> 03:30.220
(clatters)

03:30.220 --> 03:32.730
And the guy said,
"Oh shit. Just go on."

03:32.730 --> 03:36.060
He was a cowboy.
Some people are born that way.

03:36.060 --> 03:39.390
I was scared
to death of them guys,
but they were cowboys.

03:39.390 --> 03:41.310
You know, to me
they were real cowboys.

03:41.310 --> 03:44.930
Mike: He was actually
part Native American
on his mother's side,

03:44.930 --> 03:47.220
Irish and Dutch
on his father's side.

03:47.220 --> 03:51.100
Terry Jennings says
that his dad played up
both sides of his heritage,

03:51.100 --> 03:55.020
while growing up
in a tiny West Texas town
called Littlefield.

03:55.020 --> 03:56.600
My dad and Uncle Tommy

03:56.600 --> 03:58.430
would play Cowboys and Indians.

03:58.430 --> 04:01.270
Well, Dad, when he was
five years old...

04:01.270 --> 04:03.470
(toy gun popping)
...when he was walking
on a split-rail fence,

04:03.470 --> 04:06.100
and they have a thing
they call a sand fighter,

04:06.100 --> 04:07.980
which is basically
a bunch of spikes,

04:07.980 --> 04:09.560
and it's dragged
through the ground,

04:09.560 --> 04:12.140
turn the dirt over
so the wind don't blow it away.

04:12.140 --> 04:13.850
Well, he fell off that fence

04:13.850 --> 04:18.390
and stuck one
of those spikes right above
his ankle in the left leg,

04:18.390 --> 04:20.810
so it stunted
the growth in his leg.

04:20.810 --> 04:23.020
A lot of people ask me
how tall Dad is,

04:23.020 --> 04:25.640
and I'll tell 'em, "He's
six-foot-one, six-foot-two,

04:25.640 --> 04:27.520
depending on which foot
he's standing on."

04:27.520 --> 04:30.350
♪ You better move away ♪

04:30.350 --> 04:33.430
♪ You're standing
too close to the flames ♪

04:33.430 --> 04:36.680
Terry: When you watch
him play and you seen him
all leaning over to the left,

04:36.680 --> 04:39.680
that's 'cause he's over there
leaning on that short leg.

04:39.680 --> 04:43.430
Mike: His disability
didn't stop him from dreaming
with his brother, Tommy,

04:43.430 --> 04:46.220
about playing music
on the greatest stage of all,

04:46.220 --> 04:47.520
the Grand Ole Opry.

04:47.520 --> 04:50.140
Grandpa had a guitar.
Grandma played piano,

04:50.140 --> 04:51.890
taught him
the first three chords.

04:51.890 --> 04:54.310
Him and Uncle Tommy,
they would get out there

04:54.310 --> 04:56.810
and get broomsticks
and Coke crates,

04:56.810 --> 05:00.270
stand on those,
pretending like they were
Hank Williams and Ernest Tubb.

05:00.270 --> 05:04.060
Mike:
By the time Waylon was 14,
he was performing in public

05:04.060 --> 05:07.100
and working as a DJ
at a local radio station.

05:07.100 --> 05:10.180
By 19, he was married
with children,

05:10.180 --> 05:11.890
but his talent
caught the attention

05:11.890 --> 05:15.770
of another young
singer-songwriter out
of Lubbock, 80 miles away.

05:15.770 --> 05:19.680
Buddy Holly was
the first one to take Dad
into the studio.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.180
They were high school friends.

05:21.180 --> 05:23.890
And Mom,
she didn't really
like him that much

05:23.890 --> 05:25.980
because Buddy'd
pull up to the front yard...
(horn honks)

05:25.980 --> 05:28.470
...honk the horn,
and there'd go Waylon.
(door slams)

05:28.470 --> 05:30.520
Kinky Friedman:
Buddy Holly was
definitely the match

05:30.520 --> 05:34.810
that kindled the flame
for Waylon Jennings,
no question.

05:34.810 --> 05:36.350
And he also showed Waylon

05:36.350 --> 05:37.520
how easy it was

05:37.520 --> 05:39.600
for that to go away.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.850
Mike: Singer-songwriter
Kinky Friedman
was just a boy

05:42.850 --> 05:45.180
when the Crickets
made Buddy Holly a star.

05:45.180 --> 05:48.980
In 1958,
the Crickets quit Holly
in a contract dispute.

05:48.980 --> 05:52.060
Buddy turned to his old pal
Waylon for help.

05:52.060 --> 05:55.180
Buddy'd come by
the radio station
Dad was working at

05:55.180 --> 05:57.770
and said, "Hey,
you wanna go out
on the road with me?"

05:57.770 --> 06:01.430
Dad said, "Sure,"
and he goes, "Well,
you're gonna play bass."

06:01.430 --> 06:02.930
And Dad goes,
"I don't play bass.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.310
Never played
a bass in my life."

06:04.310 --> 06:06.430
Well, Buddy handed him
a bass and says,

06:06.430 --> 06:09.350
"You got two weeks
to learn how to play it
and meet me in New York."

06:09.350 --> 06:11.850
Mike:
The tour was called
the Winter Dance Party,

06:11.850 --> 06:13.600
and it included
the biggest names

06:13.600 --> 06:15.180
in rock and roll at the time.

06:15.180 --> 06:17.730
They'd been having a lot
of trouble with the bus.

06:17.730 --> 06:20.640
The heaters weren't working,
and they were, all the time,

06:20.640 --> 06:22.470
getting people to come over
and work on it.

06:22.470 --> 06:24.810
Well, Richie Valens
and the Big Bopper

06:24.810 --> 06:27.770
had both had the flu
from being on that cold bus.

06:27.770 --> 06:30.600
Mike: Holly chartered a plane
from Mason City, Iowa,

06:30.600 --> 06:33.270
to Fargo, North Dakota,
in order to stay warm

06:33.270 --> 06:34.810
on that leg of the trip.

06:34.810 --> 06:36.270
There were only three seats,

06:36.270 --> 06:37.770
and Waylon had one of them.

06:37.770 --> 06:41.140
Big Bopper is just that--
he's a great big guy,

06:41.140 --> 06:43.980
and he was sick,
and he's from Texas,

06:43.980 --> 06:46.140
and us Texas boys try
to look out for each other.

06:46.140 --> 06:48.140
And Dad says,
"Man, you know,

06:48.140 --> 06:51.180
you'd be better off
on that plane,"
and he agreed.

06:51.180 --> 06:54.220
Later on,
as they were getting ready
to go to the airplane,

06:54.220 --> 06:56.560
Dad and Buddy
are sitting backstage,

06:56.560 --> 06:58.350
and they got these
little cane-back chairs

06:58.350 --> 07:00.600
leaning against the wall,
and they was eating hot dogs.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.180
And Buddy looks
at him and says,

07:02.180 --> 07:04.680
"Well, I hear
you're scared of flying."

07:04.680 --> 07:06.350
He goes, "I ain't scared
of nothing.

07:06.350 --> 07:09.600
I just gave it
to Big Bopper
'cause he's got the flu."

07:09.600 --> 07:14.730
Buddy goes, "Well,
all I got to say is I hope
your old bus freezes up."

07:14.730 --> 07:17.850
And Dad goes, "Well, fine,
I hope your plane crashes."

07:17.850 --> 07:20.730
Announcer:
We interrupt this program
for a special news bulletin.

07:20.730 --> 07:23.640
Three young singers
who soared to the heights
of show business

07:23.640 --> 07:26.180
on the current
rock and roll craze
were killed today

07:26.180 --> 07:29.350
in the crash of a light plane
in an Iowa snow flurry.

07:29.350 --> 07:32.020
For years, he thought
he had done it, you know?

07:32.020 --> 07:34.390
And they was just kids
cutting up with each other.

07:34.390 --> 07:37.520
And but for a little confusion
about who was going to sit

07:37.520 --> 07:39.890
in what seat on the plane...

07:39.890 --> 07:41.470
he would've been the one.

07:41.470 --> 07:44.850
This one time,
we're in Fresno, California,

07:44.850 --> 07:47.560
and just before the show
he hollered at me,

07:47.560 --> 07:49.020
he said, "Come down
to the dressing room."

07:49.020 --> 07:50.680
Mike:
Drummer Richie Albright

07:50.680 --> 07:53.390
started playing
with Waylon in 1961.

07:53.390 --> 07:57.430
Very few people spent
more time on the road
with Hoss than Richie.

07:57.430 --> 07:59.020
Went down there
in his dressing room,

07:59.020 --> 08:00.730
so he shut the door
and said, "Give me a bump."

08:00.730 --> 08:03.560
(snorts)
So I just gave him
a couple of big bumps,

08:03.560 --> 08:05.390
and I took
a couple myself.

08:05.390 --> 08:07.600
Well, I forgot
that the evening before

08:07.600 --> 08:10.140
he had given me
two small packets,

08:10.140 --> 08:12.220
and he said,
"Hold these for me."

08:12.220 --> 08:14.060
And I looked at 'em
and there was two of 'em,

08:14.060 --> 08:17.770
I said, "What's he got two for?"
So I poured 'em together.

08:17.770 --> 08:21.060
Richie come up on stage,
and everything seemed fine.

08:21.060 --> 08:23.560
Then about halfway
through the first song,

08:23.560 --> 08:25.600
I noticed him wobbling.

08:25.600 --> 08:28.600
He was swinging
and not hitting anything.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.890
I run up behind him,
and he's weaving even more,

08:30.890 --> 08:33.020
so I grabbed him,
and I said, "Are you okay?"

08:33.020 --> 08:35.770
Richie:
I looked down
and I swear to God,

08:35.770 --> 08:38.060
my drumstick was a "Z."

08:38.060 --> 08:40.020
(chuckles)
That's the way it looked to me.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.930
He goes, "Don't worry about me.

08:41.930 --> 08:43.430
"Go back there
and tell your dad

08:43.430 --> 08:47.430
it's gonna be okay.
It's called Atlanta Dog."

08:47.430 --> 08:50.470
Atlanta Dog.
I'm not sure what it was.

08:50.470 --> 08:53.930
Mike:
It was a mixture
of PCP and heroin.

08:53.930 --> 08:56.100
Thanks to Richie,
the two of them had snorted

08:56.100 --> 09:00.220
a combination of Atlanta Dog
and Peruvian Cocaine.

09:00.220 --> 09:03.310
I went into the dressing room,
the place is full of people,

09:03.310 --> 09:05.310
and Dad's just laid out
on the table.

09:05.310 --> 09:08.810
And Deacon goes, uh,
"Terry, uh we're getting ready
to call an ambulance.

09:08.810 --> 09:10.810
Your dad thinks
he's having a heart attack."

09:10.810 --> 09:15.180
Mike:
Deacon was Edward James
"The Deacon" Proudfoot,

09:15.180 --> 09:17.430
a longstanding member
of the Oakland Chapter

09:17.430 --> 09:19.810
of the Hell's Angels
motorcycle club,

09:19.810 --> 09:22.310
and head of Waylon's
security detail.

09:22.310 --> 09:24.180
And I said,
"Get all these people
out of here."

09:24.180 --> 09:27.180
So Deacon ran everybody
out of the room except for me,

09:27.180 --> 09:28.810
and I leaned over to Dad,
and I said,

09:28.810 --> 09:30.640
"Dad, Richie told me
to come down here

09:30.640 --> 09:32.730
"and tell you that
you're gonna be okay.

09:32.730 --> 09:35.810
Y'all did something
called Atlanta Dog."

09:35.810 --> 09:39.020
He just stood up, and he says,
"Take me to the stage."

09:39.020 --> 09:40.680
By the time
I got back up there,

09:40.680 --> 09:42.350
they were actually
holding Richie up,

09:42.350 --> 09:45.020
and he was
still just a-swinging
the best he could.

09:45.020 --> 09:47.810
So Dad got his guitar
on best he could,

09:47.810 --> 09:50.430
and he started swinging at it,
missing strings.

09:50.430 --> 09:51.770
He was singing out of key.

09:51.770 --> 09:55.470
It was the worst show
I had ever seen in my life,

09:55.470 --> 09:58.470
but for some reason,
the audience didn't
seem to mind.

09:58.470 --> 10:03.890
Mike: Waylon launched
his solo career in Phoenix
with Richie in 1961.

10:03.890 --> 10:07.600
He was the star attraction
at a club called JD's.

10:07.600 --> 10:10.730
The only time
I ever got to see Dad was
Monday or Tuesday night,

10:10.730 --> 10:13.730
they would do a family night,
and they'd let the kids come in.

10:13.730 --> 10:17.310
Basically, what it
really meant was everybody
had to clean their show up.

10:17.310 --> 10:19.220
They had Mac,
the singing bartender.

10:19.220 --> 10:20.600
His songs were dirty.

10:20.600 --> 10:22.520
He did some really,
really bad jokes.

10:22.520 --> 10:24.600
And he played a commode lid

10:24.600 --> 10:28.140
with a guitar neck on it
that he called a "shitar."

10:28.140 --> 10:31.470
When I was in the second grade,
I decided I'd sneak downstairs

10:31.470 --> 10:33.980
where they were playing
rock and roll music.

10:33.980 --> 10:37.020
And they had half-naked girls
dancing in cages,

10:37.020 --> 10:40.520
called go-go dancers,
and I was in hog heaven.

10:40.520 --> 10:42.100
I was booked at Phoenix,

10:42.100 --> 10:45.730
and I went by JD's
where Waylon was playing,

10:45.730 --> 10:50.430
and I said, "The guy needs
to be on a major label."

10:50.430 --> 10:52.270
Mike:
Bobby Bare was on one.

10:52.270 --> 10:54.980
The Country Music Hall
of Famer was instrumental

10:54.980 --> 10:57.140
in getting Waylon
to move to Nashville.

10:57.140 --> 11:01.270
He called legendary
songwriter and producer
Chet Atkins personally.

11:01.270 --> 11:03.730
And I was cutting
my own throat doing this,

11:03.730 --> 11:07.020
because he has
the same songs I do.

11:07.020 --> 11:09.060
If Chet Atkins calls you
and offers you a deal,

11:09.060 --> 11:11.100
it's like you're getting
a deal from God.

11:11.100 --> 11:13.930
I mean, Chet Atkins
was Nashville.

11:13.930 --> 11:17.470
You know, I mean,
he was the inventor
of the Nashville Sound,

11:17.470 --> 11:19.100
and that's where
Dad wanted to go.

11:28.890 --> 11:31.520
Mike:
Atkins let him use some

11:31.520 --> 11:33.930
but Waylon's
first major studio release

11:33.930 --> 11:37.640
had that Nashville Sound,
clean and polished.

11:37.640 --> 11:39.850
Willie Nelson
told Waylon in Arizona,

11:39.850 --> 11:41.430
one of the first times
they met, and he said,

11:41.430 --> 11:44.100

It'll break your heart."

11:45.890 --> 11:48.310
Mike:
Folk Country didn't do much
on the charts,

11:48.310 --> 11:49.730
topping out at number nine,

11:49.730 --> 11:51.980
but it established
Hoss as a presence

11:51.980 --> 11:53.810
in his new town, Nashville.

11:53.810 --> 11:55.810
Waylon was very charismatic.

11:55.810 --> 11:58.350
Well, you know,
he was probably on pills,

11:58.350 --> 12:02.810
but when he'd
walk into the room,
he took all the air out.

12:02.810 --> 12:05.020
When my dad
first came to Nashville,

12:05.020 --> 12:06.980
one of the first people he met
was Roger Miller,

12:06.980 --> 12:10.680
and Roger had
a suitcase full of pills
that had different--

12:10.680 --> 12:13.270
like, some of 'em would be
half-upper, half-downer,

12:13.270 --> 12:15.600
or some of 'em would be, like,
part barbiturate and part this.

12:15.600 --> 12:16.980
They had all these names
for them

12:16.980 --> 12:19.640
that my dad and Roger
would come up with, you know?

12:19.640 --> 12:21.180
And so they'd hang out there,

12:21.180 --> 12:24.060
and party and listen
to music all night,
stay up all night.

12:24.060 --> 12:27.310
And then, you know,
get up and do it
all over again.

12:27.310 --> 12:29.640
Mike:
Shooter,
Waylon's youngest son,

12:29.640 --> 12:32.520
grew up on stories
set in the Boar's Nest,

12:32.520 --> 12:34.730
the unofficial home
of The Outsiders.

12:34.730 --> 12:38.680
The Boar's Nest was
a place that was run
by this lady, Sue Brewer.

12:38.680 --> 12:41.020
It was her apartment,
and after her work at night,

12:41.020 --> 12:44.020
she would turn on
this little neon light.

12:44.020 --> 12:46.390
Some of the better writers
back in the day

12:46.390 --> 12:49.020
would go there
'cause it was kind
of an after-hours place.

12:49.020 --> 12:54.020
The story that I was told
with that is she had slept
with a famous country star,

12:54.020 --> 12:56.890
and he knocked her up,
but he didn't want anything
to do with the kid or something,

12:56.890 --> 12:59.390
and so she said,
"I'm gonna come to Nashville,

12:59.390 --> 13:03.060
and I'm gonna screw
every young star in Nashville
to get back at you."

13:03.060 --> 13:05.390
But she ended up coming there
and working as a waitress,

13:05.390 --> 13:08.850
and all these stars
kind of gravitated
towards her, not for sex.

13:08.850 --> 13:10.810
Really, she loved
country music,

13:10.810 --> 13:14.810
and guys like Harlan Howard,
Roger Miller, Shel Silverstein,

13:14.810 --> 13:16.890
young Hank Williams Jr.,
my dad,

13:16.890 --> 13:19.430
like, Kris Kristofferson,
Willie--

13:19.430 --> 13:20.890
you could go on forever.

13:20.890 --> 13:23.270
Mike:
It was a hole-in-the-wall
for country songwriters

13:23.270 --> 13:26.100
that didn't quite fit
into the Nashville Sound.

13:26.100 --> 13:29.520
Cleverness used to be
country music's wooden leg.

13:29.520 --> 13:33.850
Nashville didn't get
these guys any better
than they got Hank Williams.

13:33.850 --> 13:37.730
We just moved to town,
been in town maybe a few months.

13:37.730 --> 13:41.180
Waylon come back there
and parked in front
of the place,

13:41.180 --> 13:42.770
and started walking up
the sidewalk.

13:42.770 --> 13:43.980
And this guy walked down

13:43.980 --> 13:45.390
and was standing there
on the stoop.

13:45.390 --> 13:48.520
I looked up,
and there was
Cowboy Jack Clement.

13:48.520 --> 13:50.220
I was already
a big fan of his.

13:50.220 --> 13:53.640
He had produced
that Cash album,
Trail of Tears.

13:53.640 --> 13:56.310
I loved that album.
I said, "Jack Clements!

13:56.310 --> 13:58.980
"Hi, I'm Richie Albright,
Waylon's drummer.

13:58.980 --> 14:02.270
Pleased to meet you."
And he grabbed my hand,

14:02.270 --> 14:06.100
started shaking,
turned and went, "Blah!"

14:06.100 --> 14:08.600
Then he kept shaking
my hand. "Blah!"

14:09.640 --> 14:12.270
Finally, he said,
"Nice to meet you."

14:12.270 --> 14:14.890
And he turned around
and went back upstairs...

14:14.890 --> 14:16.980
and we followed him.
(chuckles)

14:16.980 --> 14:20.180
Mike:
Cowboy Jack Clement
was a producer and engineer

14:20.180 --> 14:22.220
for Sam Phillips
at Sun Records.

14:22.220 --> 14:25.310
He'd recorded
Elvis Presley,
Carl Perkins,

14:25.310 --> 14:27.390
Jerry Lee Lewis,
and Johnny Cash.

14:27.390 --> 14:31.350
When I was about 10 or 11,
that was the first time
I met Johnny Cash.

14:31.350 --> 14:32.980
And him and Dad showed up,

14:32.980 --> 14:35.770
and when they hit that door,
they hit it like pinballs.

14:35.770 --> 14:37.270
They were bouncing off
of the walls.

14:37.270 --> 14:39.600
I thought they were
just nervous.

14:39.600 --> 14:42.140
Nobody took
as many pills as Waylon.

14:42.140 --> 14:46.140
Nobody could,
except maybe Johnny Cash.

14:46.140 --> 14:49.730
Waylon and Johnny Cash
got an apartment together,

14:49.730 --> 14:53.470
and, uh, Johnny would try
to make breakfast

14:53.470 --> 14:56.470
with, uh,
that black suit on,

14:56.470 --> 14:59.140
and making biscuits...
(chuckles)

14:59.140 --> 15:01.810
...flour all over everything.

15:01.810 --> 15:03.770
They were both taking
a lot of pills

15:03.770 --> 15:07.020
and trying to hide it
from one another.

15:07.020 --> 15:08.470
Cash ran out one time,

15:08.470 --> 15:12.270
and Dad had
just got enough money
to buy him a new Cadillac.

15:12.270 --> 15:16.180
And Cash just knew
that he had some pills
hidden in the glove box

15:16.180 --> 15:18.060
or in behind
the whole dashboard,

15:18.060 --> 15:20.980
and he went out there and--
didn't have keys or nothing--

15:20.980 --> 15:23.060
tore into the car.

15:23.060 --> 15:26.680
Tore that side
of the console
completely out.

15:26.680 --> 15:29.020
He thought there
was pills in there,
but there wasn't.

15:29.020 --> 15:32.390
(chuckles)
I told Waylon
a good place to hide 'em,

15:32.390 --> 15:35.810
and that's to take
the light switch out

15:35.810 --> 15:38.060
and drop 'em down in the wall.

15:38.060 --> 15:40.890
So he did that,
and he come back
to me later,

15:40.890 --> 15:42.770
and he said, "Well,
how do I get 'em out?" I said,

15:42.770 --> 15:45.220
"Well, you got to knock a hole
in the wall down at the bottom.

15:45.220 --> 15:47.980
When you really want 'em,
you gotta do that."

15:47.980 --> 15:52.390
It was like, um,
Van Gogh and Gauguin
when they were roommates,

15:52.390 --> 15:57.020
where Gauguin had
a better commercial eye
for what was happening.

15:57.020 --> 15:59.770
That would be Johnny Cash,
and yet he's another one

15:59.770 --> 16:04.220
that couldn't get
a record deal in Nashville.
It's incredible, isn't it?

16:04.220 --> 16:05.980
They said of Van Gogh
and Gauguin,

16:05.980 --> 16:09.310
that Gauguin loved
the sunshine, for painting,

16:09.310 --> 16:13.020
but Van Gogh
loved the sun,

16:13.020 --> 16:16.730
and he got too close
to it sometimes.
That's Waylon.

16:16.730 --> 16:19.890
I remember we were
on tour across Canada,

16:19.890 --> 16:22.390
and Waylon was fixing
to go on stage.

16:22.390 --> 16:24.100
And I saw him
reach in his pocket,

16:24.100 --> 16:26.020
take a whole
handful of pills.

16:26.020 --> 16:28.850
I said, "Whoa!" I said,
"How many of those pills

16:28.850 --> 16:31.560
do you think you take
a day? Five, six?"

16:31.560 --> 16:35.850
He said, "Thirty."
I said, "Thirty! Holy shit."

16:35.850 --> 16:38.600
Nashville ran
on amphetamines.

16:38.600 --> 16:41.140
I mean, this whole town
was just...

16:41.140 --> 16:43.100
Everybody had a bottle of pills.

16:43.100 --> 16:46.890
We got to the point
where we had to get back out
on the road to get some rest.

16:46.890 --> 16:49.520
You never slept
when you were in town.

16:49.520 --> 16:51.770
Captain Midnight was
our go-to guy.

16:51.770 --> 16:54.730
Mike:
Captain Midnight,
AKA Roger Schutt,

16:54.730 --> 16:57.390
was a country music
aficionado and DJ

16:57.390 --> 17:01.980
who played nothing
but Waylon Jennings, nonstop,
his last day on the job.

17:01.980 --> 17:05.310
My nephew called me,
and he said, "Turn on KDF.

17:05.310 --> 17:06.770
You ain't gonna believe
this shit."

17:06.770 --> 17:10.100
I turned it on,
and Captain Midnight,
he's rambling on.

17:10.100 --> 17:12.350
(rattling)
He had wired the door shut

17:12.350 --> 17:15.390
and just started playing
Waylon constantly.

17:15.390 --> 17:18.770
And he said,
"This'll probably be
my last show here,

17:18.770 --> 17:21.930
but I just wanna play
all the good music I can,"
you know?

17:21.930 --> 17:23.100
And he kept playing Waylon.

17:23.100 --> 17:24.520
Mike:
He landed on his feet

17:24.520 --> 17:26.810
as kind of
a barbiturate middleman

17:26.810 --> 17:30.180
and an advisor of sorts
to the outcast songwriters.

17:30.180 --> 17:33.270
Captain Midnight was
a spiritual leader
of the time,

17:33.270 --> 17:35.430
the angel on Waylon's shoulder.

17:35.430 --> 17:37.930
And for Waylon
to have the wisdom
of surrounding himself

17:37.930 --> 17:39.680
by somebody good
like Midnight,

17:39.680 --> 17:41.930
who today we could call
a homeless person,

17:41.930 --> 17:44.140
um, that was real good.

17:44.140 --> 17:46.770
It definitely made it easier
for him to get the drugs.

17:46.770 --> 17:48.980
The thing I remember
mostly about Captain Midnight

17:48.980 --> 17:51.980
is two times a day,
you didn't bother him

17:51.980 --> 17:55.100
'cause he was in there
watching Rocky and
Bullwinkle cartoons.

17:55.100 --> 17:57.770
Bare:
If you wanted pills,
give Midnight a hundred bucks,

17:57.770 --> 18:00.640
he'd go to Dr. Snap
and buy a bunch of speed.

18:00.640 --> 18:03.560
Richie:
Dr. Snap would write
the prescriptions,

18:03.560 --> 18:06.600
'cause he owned
the drugstore right next
to his office.

18:06.600 --> 18:11.020
Saved a lot of lives
because of all the touring
we had to do back then.

18:11.020 --> 18:13.980
You'd be tired from driving
all night and all day,

18:13.980 --> 18:16.060
probably didn't get
hardly any sleep,

18:16.060 --> 18:18.850
so by the time
it'd come showtime,

18:18.850 --> 18:20.600
the band used
to get together and say,

18:20.600 --> 18:23.430
"Okay, I'm taking four of these
and three of these.

18:23.430 --> 18:24.730
What are you taking?"

18:24.730 --> 18:27.020
We all wanted to be
on the same level, right?

18:27.020 --> 18:29.930
So that was the ritual.

18:29.930 --> 18:33.180
Every time Waylon
and Richie needed money,

18:33.180 --> 18:36.310
they would go
out to New Mexico
to the Navajo Nation

18:36.310 --> 18:38.060
and hang out there
for a month.

18:38.060 --> 18:40.310
They had done it
for years and years,

18:40.310 --> 18:42.310
and sometimes
he'd go twice a year.

18:42.310 --> 18:43.470
They loved him.

18:43.470 --> 18:45.890
I mean,
you'd get to town,

18:45.890 --> 18:48.140
and they'd have
a parade for Waylon.

18:48.140 --> 18:51.980
If it wasn't for the Navajo
and all those Four Corner
Indians up there,

18:51.980 --> 18:55.560
we probably would've starved
to death in the early '70s.

18:55.560 --> 18:58.350
When I went with Waylon
to the Navajo Nation,

18:58.350 --> 18:59.980
we stayed at a great hotel.

18:59.980 --> 19:01.730
It was one of those
older hotels.

19:01.730 --> 19:05.020
John Wayne, I guess,
and all of them people
used to stay at this hotel.

19:05.020 --> 19:07.270
And Waylon turned around,
and he said to me, he says,

19:07.270 --> 19:09.730
"You know, Bourke,
I'm real big here."

19:09.730 --> 19:12.600
"Yeah, well, fuck, Waylon,
you're big everywhere."

19:12.600 --> 19:16.930
He says, "No, I'm like
the Rolling Stones here."

19:16.930 --> 19:19.680
That night at the gig,
there had to be

19:19.680 --> 19:22.140
10,000 Navajos out there.
(country music playing)

19:22.140 --> 19:27.470
It was in a rodeo ring,
and had those bars that
went across, you know.

19:27.470 --> 19:29.430
And the people
were jammed up.

19:29.430 --> 19:32.270
They would pack those people
in there like BB's.

19:32.270 --> 19:33.850
I mean, they were
in there drinking,

19:33.850 --> 19:35.730
and I can tell you right now,
if they got drunk,

19:35.730 --> 19:38.560
they couldn't pass out
and hit the ground
until somebody left,

19:38.560 --> 19:40.770
'cause it was just
that tight in there.

19:40.770 --> 19:42.430
But when Waylon
was singing,

19:42.430 --> 19:46.100
all them people
were singing in harmony
with Waylon Jennings.

19:46.100 --> 19:51.810
♪ Well, the honky-tonks in Texas
were my natural second home ♪

19:51.810 --> 19:53.600
(cheering)

19:53.600 --> 19:56.470
♪ Well, you tip
your hat to the ladies ♪

19:56.470 --> 20:00.140
♪ And the Rose of San Antone ♪

20:00.140 --> 20:04.850
My understanding is "Navajo"
translates into "common people,"

20:04.850 --> 20:08.560
and Dad had that album out,
Love of the Common People,

20:08.560 --> 20:10.640
and they adopted
that song as theirs,

20:10.640 --> 20:13.310
'cause, uh, it pretty much--
if you listen to the song--

20:13.310 --> 20:15.350
fits their total situation.

20:15.350 --> 20:17.060
We were playing there
for two nights.

20:17.060 --> 20:19.640
And the first night,
Dad didn't make it
to the show.

20:19.640 --> 20:22.810
Well, the Indians
didn't like that one little bit,

20:22.810 --> 20:25.310
and they came out,
and they started telling us,

20:25.310 --> 20:27.390
you know,
"Waylon play now."

20:27.390 --> 20:29.520
And we said,
"Well, Waylon's not here."

20:29.520 --> 20:31.220
And they said,
"Waylon's on the bus."

20:31.220 --> 20:33.770
And we said,
"No, he's not on the bus."

20:33.770 --> 20:35.810
And they took us around
to the back of the bus,

20:35.810 --> 20:38.430
and they said, "Look,
Waylon's name on bus.

20:38.430 --> 20:40.100
Waylon's on the bus."

20:40.100 --> 20:42.220
And we said, "Well,
just 'cause his name
is on the bus

20:42.220 --> 20:43.470
doesn't mean
he's on the bus."

20:43.470 --> 20:46.180
Well, finally,
the chief came up,

20:46.180 --> 20:47.600
and we took him on the bus,

20:47.600 --> 20:48.980
and took him all
the way through it

20:48.980 --> 20:51.020
to prove to him that Waylon
was not on the bus.

20:51.020 --> 20:52.890
So they were satisfied
with that,

20:52.890 --> 20:54.680
and we got out
of there unscathed.

20:54.680 --> 20:57.980
The Navajo Nation thought
Waylon Jennings was king.

20:57.980 --> 21:01.310
He always says, "I was
always on your side."
(laughs)

21:01.310 --> 21:02.810
Do you know?
It was great.

21:02.810 --> 21:05.470
I remember,
really distinctly,

21:05.470 --> 21:07.100
the first time
I ever met Waylon,

21:07.100 --> 21:10.680
I was walking in an alley
behind Music Row
in Nashville,

21:10.680 --> 21:12.140
and I had all my songs
in a...

21:12.140 --> 21:14.850
fucking-- some kind
of homemade satchel thing.

21:14.850 --> 21:19.680
And Waylon
pulls up in this big,
uh, Mark IV Lincoln,

21:19.680 --> 21:22.730
and he slams on the brakes,
and he says, "Get in, Kink.

21:22.730 --> 21:26.270
Walking's bad
for your image."
And he was right.

21:26.270 --> 21:29.100
Mike:
From the moment Waylon
released  Folk Country,

21:29.100 --> 21:31.060
his image and sound
had been branded

21:31.060 --> 21:33.520
by the Nashville way
of doing business.

21:33.520 --> 21:35.600
Waylon and Willie
were not happy

21:35.600 --> 21:38.060
about the way record companies
controlled things,

21:38.060 --> 21:40.390
and the way they would tell you
which songs you're gonna sing,

21:40.390 --> 21:43.220
and the way they would pick
the musicians for the sessions,

21:43.220 --> 21:45.220
and the good-old-boy
fraternity they had

21:45.220 --> 21:47.060
that they wouldn't let
anybody else into.

21:47.060 --> 21:50.680
And definitely,
drugs were anathema to them.

21:50.680 --> 21:53.390
Willie Nelson
couldn't get arrested

21:53.390 --> 21:55.390
because of the way
they made him record.

21:55.390 --> 21:57.600
They wouldn't
let him play guitar
on his own records.

21:57.600 --> 21:59.600
They wouldn't let him
use his own band.

21:59.600 --> 22:01.980
And he knew what
he wanted to sound like.

22:01.980 --> 22:03.560
Willie was
a great songwriter.

22:03.560 --> 22:05.220
Everybody knew it,
but they didn't think

22:05.220 --> 22:07.100
he was ever going
to amount to anything.

22:07.100 --> 22:10.850
And when he left Nashville
in '71 to go back to Texas,

22:10.850 --> 22:12.640
everybody there
said the same thing,

22:12.640 --> 22:14.430
"We'll never hear
from that guy again.

22:14.430 --> 22:15.930
That's the end of Willie."

22:15.930 --> 22:17.890
And a lot of that, I think,

22:17.890 --> 22:20.520
was the same problem
Waylon had.

22:20.520 --> 22:22.350
Mike:
A big part
of that problem,

22:22.350 --> 22:24.600
in Nashville parlance,
was the drugs.

22:24.600 --> 22:28.730
In Texas, Willie was free
to pursue the life
he chose to lead,

22:28.730 --> 22:31.560
and he found a new audience
who could appreciate him.

22:31.560 --> 22:35.310
About '73,
Willie calls Waylon, said,

22:35.310 --> 22:37.100
"Waylon, you gotta
get down here.

22:37.100 --> 22:39.100
"I have found our audience.

22:39.100 --> 22:42.270
"It's about half-ass hippie,
half-ass cowboy,

22:42.270 --> 22:43.770
but Texas is full of 'em."

22:43.770 --> 22:48.730
We went down to play
the Armadillo World Headquarters
in Austin, Texas.

22:48.730 --> 22:51.680
It was a bunch of hippies
out there, and he told Willie,

22:51.680 --> 22:53.270
"If I go out there

22:53.270 --> 22:55.140
and them people
give me a hard time,

22:55.140 --> 22:57.520
I'm gonna kick your ass!"
(laughs)

22:57.520 --> 22:59.680
Willie had started playing
the little honky-tonks

22:59.680 --> 23:02.350
around Austin,
and it took a hold.

23:02.350 --> 23:06.470
The next thing you know,
he's playing for 11, 12,
13,000 people

23:06.470 --> 23:08.470
at a little,
small outdoor concert.

23:08.470 --> 23:10.520
And it grew
from that, you know.

23:10.520 --> 23:13.180
We had never seen
any reactions like that.

23:13.180 --> 23:14.600
About halfway through the show,

23:14.600 --> 23:16.980
he was playing lead,
and we walked back
there by me,

23:16.980 --> 23:19.980
and he said,
"Somebody go get that
little redhead son of a bitch.

23:19.980 --> 23:21.310
What's he got me into?"

23:21.310 --> 23:22.890
'Cause we had never seen

23:22.890 --> 23:26.430
cowboys and hippies together
without fighting.

23:26.430 --> 23:29.140
That was kind of the start
of the whole thing.

23:29.140 --> 23:32.020
Mike:
The whole thing was known
in country music lore

23:32.020 --> 23:35.140
as the outlaw movement,
but for Waylon,

23:35.140 --> 23:38.140
it almost came to an end
before it ever got started.

23:38.140 --> 23:41.770
My dad, he had gotten sick
and, uh-- from hepatitis A.

23:41.770 --> 23:44.680
It's like, "Who gets that?"
Everyone gets "B" and "C,"

23:44.680 --> 23:46.680
but I've never heard
of anybody getting "A."

23:46.680 --> 23:48.560
I went to the hospital
to see Waylon,

23:48.560 --> 23:50.730
and his liver
had given out on him.

23:50.730 --> 23:54.560
He turned yellow,
and he had stopped
doing speed

23:54.560 --> 23:58.180
because...
couldn't do it no more.

23:58.180 --> 24:00.100
Waylon had
to get off the pills.

24:00.100 --> 24:01.350
He needed some money.

24:01.350 --> 24:05.680
He, uh, went to RCA
to ask for an advance,

24:05.680 --> 24:09.560
and they offered him
$5,000 if he'd re-sign.

24:09.560 --> 24:13.520
Well, that...
even back then,
that wasn't much.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.730
And that's when Richie
had found Neil Reshen,

24:15.730 --> 24:18.180
the manager
that kind of came in
and turned it all around.

24:18.180 --> 24:20.390
"Mad dog on a leash,"
that's what I call him.

24:20.390 --> 24:24.060
He was exactly
what Dad needed at the time
when he came along.

24:24.060 --> 24:27.390
He was a coked-up
Jewish lawyer.

24:27.390 --> 24:29.640
(laughs)
I don't know.

24:29.640 --> 24:33.430
He had a very thin,
kind of an Abe Lincoln
type beard,

24:33.430 --> 24:36.060
was the manager
for Miles Davis,

24:36.060 --> 24:38.310
and so "knew where
all the bodies were buried."

24:38.310 --> 24:41.810
I told Waylon, I said,
"You're probably not going
to like this guy,

24:41.810 --> 24:44.270
but just listen
to what he has to say."

24:44.270 --> 24:46.730
And so he did,
and they hooked up

24:46.730 --> 24:49.020
with a handshake
after that meeting.

24:49.020 --> 24:51.060
And I took Neil back
to the airport,

24:51.060 --> 24:54.770
and Willie Nelson
came down to the airport,
met up with Neil.

24:54.770 --> 24:58.390
And they had a handshake,
and by the time Neil went
back to New York,

24:58.390 --> 25:02.140
he was managing
the two biggest acts
in country music.

25:02.140 --> 25:03.850
My dad grew his hair out

25:03.850 --> 25:06.390
and his beard out
because he was sick.

25:06.390 --> 25:09.600
And the manager was like,
you know, "Leave your beard."

25:09.600 --> 25:11.270
He's like,
"You really look the part now."

25:11.270 --> 25:13.140
And it changed everything,
and then everyone grew

25:13.140 --> 25:14.770
their beards out
and their hair out.

25:14.770 --> 25:18.140
That's what started
that whole outlaw shit.

25:18.140 --> 25:22.270
Mike:
With his new legal mouthpiece,
the Mad Dog Reshen, in tow,

25:22.270 --> 25:23.890
Hoss went back to Nashville.

25:23.890 --> 25:27.140
Dad and Neil were
over at RCA's offices,

25:27.140 --> 25:29.390
renegotiating Dad's contract.

25:29.390 --> 25:31.890
And it came down to a point
to where there was,

25:31.890 --> 25:35.220
like, a $25,000 stickler
in there,

25:35.220 --> 25:37.520
you know, that nobody's
wanting to come off of.

25:37.520 --> 25:40.850
They said their side,
and Dad sold his side,

25:40.850 --> 25:44.060
and then there's
that dead silence,
and it's like, you know,

25:44.060 --> 25:47.810
the first one
that talks is gonna be
the one that loses.

25:47.810 --> 25:50.890
Well, Dad stood up
and just left the room.
(door opens, closes)

25:50.890 --> 25:53.270
Well, they thought
he was pissed,

25:53.270 --> 25:56.980
and, uh, so they caved in
while he was gone.

25:56.980 --> 25:58.560
And then when
they were leaving,
Neil said,

25:58.560 --> 26:01.470
"That was
the most genius thing
I ever saw anybody do."

26:01.470 --> 26:03.180
He goes, "What?
I had to take a piss."

26:03.180 --> 26:06.270
Neil said,
"We got 50,000!"
(laughs)
