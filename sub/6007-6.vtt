00:22.703 --> 00:25.004

00:27.108 --> 00:28.341
<i>The idea behind the DRNs</i>

00:28.376 --> 00:30.276
<i>was to be as human as possible.</i>

00:30.311 --> 00:32.812
<i>They were based on a program</i>
<i>called Synthetic Soul.</i>

00:32.847 --> 00:34.208
<i>That's one of the crazy ones.</i>

00:34.215 --> 00:35.982
- I'll lead you in?
- Let's go.

00:36.016 --> 00:37.717

00:37.752 --> 00:39.452

00:53.467 --> 00:56.202
Normally, I would prescribe
migraine medication,

00:56.237 --> 00:57.971
but with the frequency
of your headaches,

00:58.005 --> 01:00.407
and the fact that they tend to
occur at the same time of day,

01:00.441 --> 01:02.542
it suggests the possibility

01:02.576 --> 01:04.177
of a neurological syndrome.

01:04.211 --> 01:06.613
I'm going to recommend a 13%...

01:08.182 --> 01:10.650
Thir-thir-thirteen percent
chance to rule out...

01:11.986 --> 01:13.586
Rule out what?

01:14.455 --> 01:15.755
What's wrong with me?

01:18.826 --> 01:19.726
What the...?

01:19.760 --> 01:21.628
Come on!

01:23.164 --> 01:24.197
Hey, can I get some help here?

01:24.231 --> 01:26.499
My machine froze up.

01:26.534 --> 01:27.567
I need to know
what's wrong with me.

01:27.601 --> 01:28.935
Red light's on.
Someone will come.

01:33.340 --> 01:35.108
I need a surgeon.

01:36.677 --> 01:38.478
Warning. Sterilization

01:38.512 --> 01:40.146
compromised.

01:40.181 --> 01:41.481
I don't want to hurt anyone.

01:41.515 --> 01:43.550
I am going to have
a heart attack.

01:43.584 --> 01:46.186
Sir, just-just take it easy.
I need to be put

01:46.220 --> 01:47.921
on life support.

01:47.955 --> 01:50.256
I need
a cardiovascular surgeon.

01:50.291 --> 01:52.091
- Now!
- If you just down the gun,

01:52.126 --> 01:53.960
- tell me what's going...
- I need a single

01:53.994 --> 01:58.131
isomer anesthetic and
a heart-lung bypass machine.

01:58.165 --> 02:00.934
You have one
on the second floor.

02:02.169 --> 02:04.304
- Go ahead, Maureen.
- Okay.

02:04.338 --> 02:07.140
- I'm sorry. I don't want to hurt anyone.
- Dr. Elman, O.R. five.

02:07.174 --> 02:09.209
- Dr. Elman.
- I don't want

02:09.243 --> 02:11.110
- to hurt anyone.
- If you just put the gun down...

02:13.747 --> 02:15.615
You are not listening!

02:22.089 --> 02:24.290
He's crashing.
Get a crash cart.

02:24.325 --> 02:26.159
- Let's get a EKG.
- I'm sorry.

02:26.193 --> 02:28.695
They killed me.

02:28.729 --> 02:31.798
- I've got a pulse.
- They killed me...

02:53.821 --> 02:55.855
Hmm.

02:55.890 --> 02:57.991
<i>Now
you just ran a red light.</i>

02:58.025 --> 02:59.659
- It was yellow.
- It was red.

02:59.693 --> 03:01.027
- Yellow. - Red.
- It was yellow.

03:01.061 --> 03:02.695
John, it was red
2.4 seconds ago.

03:02.730 --> 03:04.597
- Would you like me to print out a photo replay?
- Yeah, why don't

03:04.632 --> 03:05.999
you issue me a ticket
while you're at it.

03:06.033 --> 03:08.401
- Okay. Already did.
- Oh, come on. Give me

03:08.435 --> 03:10.770
- a break.
- I'm here to protect you, John.

03:10.804 --> 03:12.205
Invalidate the ticket.

03:12.239 --> 03:14.607
Insurance premiums are designed
to keep people in check.

03:14.642 --> 03:16.042
I don't make the rules.

03:16.076 --> 03:17.310
I enforce them. And apparently
I'm the only one

03:17.344 --> 03:18.584
- who follows them.
- You know what,

03:18.612 --> 03:20.813
you should break a rule or two
now and then.

03:20.848 --> 03:22.282
- Look good on you.
- 72,

03:22.316 --> 03:24.584
suspicious death.
St. Mary's Hospital.

03:24.618 --> 03:26.252
Show us responding.

03:41.368 --> 03:43.069
Well, look what we have here.

03:45.005 --> 03:46.326
Insert your hand

03:46.340 --> 03:48.174
palm down into the scanner.

03:48.208 --> 03:49.842
Insert your hand palm down...

03:49.877 --> 03:53.513
Must be weird seeing
another version of yourself.

03:53.547 --> 03:56.482
It's weird seeing one of
us do something like this.

03:56.517 --> 03:58.585
We were designed to be cops.

03:58.619 --> 03:59.953
You were designed to be a cop?

04:01.121 --> 04:02.221
Hmm.

04:02.256 --> 04:04.958
Come on.

04:15.669 --> 04:19.038
Victim I.D.s as Leonard Li.
Cause of death,

04:19.072 --> 04:21.874
cardiac arrest. He was
diagnosed three years ago

04:21.909 --> 04:24.043
with terminal congestive
heart failure.

04:24.078 --> 04:26.145
He should've died then.

04:27.748 --> 04:30.016
He had a bio-mech heart.

04:30.050 --> 04:31.317
It's a pricey organ.

04:31.352 --> 04:33.453
Not as dependable
as a perfect stem cell regrow

04:33.487 --> 04:35.388
but a good upper-middle
class heart.

04:35.422 --> 04:36.923
So why are we here?

04:36.957 --> 04:39.058
There's no record
of any transplant for him.

04:39.093 --> 04:41.327
He's not on any
official recipient list.

04:41.362 --> 04:43.062
And there's something else.

04:43.097 --> 04:44.497
They killed me.

04:44.531 --> 04:47.100
They killed me...

04:48.836 --> 04:50.637
- I don't want to hurt anyone.
- If you just put

04:50.671 --> 04:53.706
the gun down...

04:53.741 --> 04:56.409
You are not listening!

04:59.079 --> 05:00.146
It's Cantonese.

05:00.180 --> 05:02.649
He said, "It's
almost 9:18."

05:02.683 --> 05:05.785
That's weird. That
was his time of death.

05:08.489 --> 05:10.890
They killed me...

05:10.924 --> 05:12.525
How could he have known that?

05:18.365 --> 05:20.867
<i>What do you got for me?</i>

05:20.901 --> 05:23.036
The coroner's office has
delivered the heart to Rudy

05:23.070 --> 05:24.771
for analysis. According to

05:24.805 --> 05:26.906
surveillance,
Mr. Li seemed to know

05:26.940 --> 05:28.841
exactly when he was gonna die.

05:28.876 --> 05:30.009
Like someone killed him.

05:30.044 --> 05:31.678
So we're calling it a homicide.

05:31.712 --> 05:33.680
His mother's here now.
Valerie's sitting down with her.

05:33.714 --> 05:35.648
We'll see what she can tell us.

05:35.683 --> 05:36.749
Let me know what you find.

05:36.784 --> 05:38.017
Copy that.

05:41.789 --> 05:43.856
This is DRN 494.

05:43.891 --> 05:45.725
We're taking him with us.

05:45.759 --> 05:46.859
No.

05:46.894 --> 05:48.194
No. No, no, no, no.

05:48.228 --> 05:49.762
We're not. Dorian,
that's hospital property.

05:49.797 --> 05:50.997
Take him back.

05:51.031 --> 05:53.499
John, he is a highly decorated
police officer.

05:53.534 --> 05:55.635
An android given
a synthetic soul like me,

05:55.669 --> 05:57.470
designed to connect
with people.

05:57.504 --> 05:59.572
He's not a mechanic. He's a cop.

05:59.606 --> 06:01.441
Was a cop, Dorian. He was a cop.

06:01.475 --> 06:03.076
Now he's a janitor
with a tool belt.

06:03.110 --> 06:04.010
Take him back.

06:04.044 --> 06:05.311
My shift's over, man.

06:05.345 --> 06:06.706
Hey, buddy, do me
a favor. Don't...

06:06.714 --> 06:08.214
don't call me "man," all right?

06:08.248 --> 06:09.649
- He's just running his colloquial routine.
- I'm just running

06:09.683 --> 06:11.484
- my colloquial routine. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Look, I get it.

06:11.518 --> 06:13.352
This is my car, okay?

06:13.387 --> 06:16.656
This car doesn't move
with him in it.

06:18.425 --> 06:21.094
Hey. Hey, what are you doing?

06:21.128 --> 06:23.029
Whoa!

06:24.231 --> 06:25.698
Hey, hey...
Whoa, will you stop that?

06:25.733 --> 06:27.100
I'll stop, but he's coming

06:27.134 --> 06:28.768
- for a ride-along.
- Dorian,

06:28.802 --> 06:30.236
you don't drive this car.

06:30.270 --> 06:32.305
You think this is the first time
I've done this?

06:33.107 --> 06:34.674
Hey! Hey! Dorian,

06:34.708 --> 06:35.575
it violates every...

06:35.609 --> 06:36.609
Will you just...

06:36.643 --> 06:39.412
You should break
a law or two, John.

06:39.446 --> 06:41.948
It looks good on you.

06:47.054 --> 06:49.422
Fine. He can ride with us.

07:00.134 --> 07:03.336
So, what case
are we working on now, man?

07:03.370 --> 07:05.805
Transplanted black market
modified hearts.

07:05.839 --> 07:07.340
That sounds like

07:07.374 --> 07:08.641
a complex operation.

07:08.675 --> 07:10.743
Yeah, man, this is
no tooth extraction.

07:10.778 --> 07:14.580
Wow. That's...
an insightful observation.

07:14.615 --> 07:16.082
I'm sorry.
What were you saying?

07:16.116 --> 07:19.018
I was distracted by the sound
of good police work.

07:19.052 --> 07:20.253
Don't listen to him.

07:20.287 --> 07:21.754
He's grumpy on the outside,

07:21.789 --> 07:24.157
morose and malcontent
on the inside.

07:24.191 --> 07:25.792
Kennex.

07:25.826 --> 07:27.660
John, where are you?

07:28.996 --> 07:30.730
I'm in ride-along hell.
What's up?

07:30.764 --> 07:34.100
Okay, well, the model
that was in Mr. Li is called

07:34.134 --> 07:37.303
a Vastrel Alpha, a
top-of-the-line bio-mech heart.

07:37.337 --> 07:39.238
I found something.

07:39.273 --> 07:42.508
Hmm... I wish my colonoscopy looked
this clean.

07:44.478 --> 07:46.145
I have a look at this.

07:46.180 --> 07:48.281
What is it, Rudy?

07:48.315 --> 07:51.150
Some kind of graphene circuit
modification.

07:51.185 --> 07:53.653
- There's a few of 'em in there. - DRN
Randy, why are they in there?

07:53.687 --> 07:54.987
What's their purpose?

07:55.022 --> 07:57.490
It's Rudy. I'm not sure yet.

07:57.524 --> 07:59.425
I'll have to run diagnostics.

07:59.459 --> 08:02.295
All right, thanks, Rudy.
Let us know what you find.

08:06.834 --> 08:09.502
Bet your friends at the hospital
are real, uh, worried about you.

08:09.536 --> 08:11.838
It's getting kind of late.

08:17.277 --> 08:18.611
Okay,

08:18.645 --> 08:20.012
one of you's getting
out of this car,

08:20.047 --> 08:21.180
and I don't care who.

08:25.986 --> 08:27.553
Well, that was easy.

08:27.588 --> 08:30.756
What is he doing?

08:32.359 --> 08:33.426
Don't move!

08:33.460 --> 08:35.361
Police.

08:35.395 --> 08:36.562
Oh, no.

08:51.478 --> 08:54.447
WOMAN: Um,

08:54.481 --> 08:56.649
can I leave?!

09:06.152 --> 09:08.553
Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy.
What are you doing?

09:08.588 --> 09:09.688
Give me your cuffs.

09:09.722 --> 09:10.789
This is Raphael Vasquez.

09:10.823 --> 09:12.757
- He's wanted for armed robbery.
- <i>Was</i>

09:12.792 --> 09:14.492
wanted. I did my time.

09:14.527 --> 09:15.727
Three years ago.

09:15.761 --> 09:18.063
Update your files.

09:22.034 --> 09:24.302
Dorian...

09:24.337 --> 09:27.672
I gave him his case files back.

09:27.707 --> 09:30.075
Obviously they're outdated.

09:30.109 --> 09:31.877
My bad.

09:31.911 --> 09:33.945
Sorry, sir.

09:36.182 --> 09:38.516
What's wrong with you?

09:38.551 --> 09:40.185
- Have a nice day, man.
- You gave him

09:40.219 --> 09:43.655
his case files back?

09:43.689 --> 09:47.659
And access to portions
of the police database.

09:48.961 --> 09:49.961
What is going on?!

09:49.996 --> 09:52.030
We were on our way
to Vastrel and, uh...

09:52.064 --> 09:53.431
Do you have any idea

09:53.466 --> 09:55.166
how much those things cost?

09:55.201 --> 09:57.936
Get going on the Vastrel case.

09:57.970 --> 10:00.171
Yeah. Okay, w-we're on...

10:04.677 --> 10:07.178
I just want to sincerely
apologize for...

10:07.213 --> 10:09.281
Buddy, I don't want
to hear you, okay?

10:09.315 --> 10:12.250
I want to see you in the back
of the cruiser. Now.

10:15.454 --> 10:17.756
Why?

10:17.790 --> 10:20.225
Why are we taking Mr. Fix It
for a ride-along?

10:23.162 --> 10:25.330
When I was decommissioned...

10:25.364 --> 10:27.933
the second before
it happened...

10:27.967 --> 10:30.735
I just kept thinking,

10:30.770 --> 10:34.739
"I really hope there's someone
there to wake me up again."

10:35.741 --> 10:37.642
I just want to be a cop, man.

10:37.677 --> 10:40.245
I just want to be here.

10:41.681 --> 10:44.316
And then...

10:44.350 --> 10:46.685
you woke me up.

10:46.719 --> 10:49.020
It was you.

10:51.157 --> 10:53.158
You were that person
for me, John.

10:53.192 --> 10:55.260
Well, we all make mistakes.

11:00.700 --> 11:02.968
I want to be that
person for him.

11:10.142 --> 11:12.243
Okay, fine.

11:13.946 --> 11:16.781
I swear, he so much as steps
one more foot outside

11:16.816 --> 11:20.652
this vehicle, and I'm tossing
him over the wall, okay?

11:20.686 --> 11:23.254
I'm gonna be that guy for him.

11:32.698 --> 11:34.165
Another solution.

11:34.200 --> 11:37.135
There were no other roads
to consider.

11:37.169 --> 11:40.271
Nobody would help us.

11:43.175 --> 11:47.579
We could not get insurance.

11:47.613 --> 11:49.948
We had no choice
but the black market.

11:49.982 --> 11:52.050
I understand.

11:52.084 --> 11:54.152
I loved him.

11:55.855 --> 11:58.289
I loved him.

11:59.291 --> 12:01.126
<i>She said Leonard</i>

12:01.160 --> 12:04.295
had the transplant a
year ago at this place.

12:05.364 --> 12:07.065
The building doesn't
exist anymore,

12:07.099 --> 12:08.666
but when it did,
it was abandoned.

12:08.701 --> 12:12.203
Amazing he survived the surgery
in these conditions.

12:12.238 --> 12:15.607
Even a black market heart
had to be paid for.

12:15.641 --> 12:17.275
Look into his financials.

12:17.309 --> 12:20.612
Track back the money trail,
find out who these people are.

12:20.646 --> 12:22.547
Mm-hmm.

12:25.017 --> 12:27.185
<i>Here at Vastrel,</i>

12:27.219 --> 12:29.054
we focus on the big things...

12:29.088 --> 12:30.355
May I help you?

12:30.389 --> 12:32.524
We're here to speak
to Pauline Rivera.

12:32.558 --> 12:34.893
Of course.

12:34.927 --> 12:37.495
Mrs. Rivera's
office, please.

12:39.698 --> 12:43.268
What? Don't you think you
should donate something?

12:43.302 --> 12:45.770
These children can't pay
for technologies

12:45.805 --> 12:47.072
that would improve their lives.

12:47.106 --> 12:49.074
Maybe you should wait in
the car with your new buddy.

12:49.108 --> 12:50.975
You have a synthetic leg.

12:51.010 --> 12:52.744
Technology has improved
your life.

12:52.778 --> 12:54.145
Are you ashamed of that leg?

12:54.180 --> 12:55.413
Nope, of course not.

12:55.448 --> 12:56.915
You never want to talk about it.

12:56.949 --> 12:58.283
Now you don't want to donate.

12:58.317 --> 12:59.918
Look, I'm fine. I donate.

12:59.952 --> 13:01.219
How much?

13:02.188 --> 13:03.188
As a percentage of your income?

13:03.222 --> 13:04.522
I'm not...

13:04.557 --> 13:05.657
I don't have to tell you that.

13:05.691 --> 13:07.592
Well, the national average
is four percent,

13:07.626 --> 13:09.327
so when you say "donate"...

13:09.361 --> 13:11.329
Okay, look, if I donate,
will you shut his mouth?

13:11.363 --> 13:14.099
That what it's going to take?

13:32.218 --> 13:34.452
How much did you give?

13:34.487 --> 13:36.221
Enough to buy plenty of silence.

13:36.255 --> 13:38.123
Mrs. Rivera will
see you now.

13:38.157 --> 13:40.225
Thank you for your donation.
Thanks.

13:42.027 --> 13:44.829
He has a synthetic leg.

13:44.864 --> 13:47.165
Somehow this heart found its way

13:47.199 --> 13:48.500
into a man named Leonard Li.

13:48.534 --> 13:50.468
Do you have any idea
how that may have happened?

13:50.503 --> 13:51.603
No idea, but

13:51.637 --> 13:53.204
it's definitely one
of our hearts.

13:53.239 --> 13:54.339
You are aware

13:54.373 --> 13:57.041
that it's illegal
to resell bio-mech organs.

13:57.076 --> 13:59.310
We are very aware of that.

13:59.345 --> 14:01.546
Vastrel complies
with all regulations.

14:01.580 --> 14:02.614
Jacinta,

14:02.648 --> 14:03.748
I sent you a serial number.

14:03.782 --> 14:05.016
Can you bring me
the file, please?

14:05.050 --> 14:06.351
What about this piece?

14:06.385 --> 14:08.153
We found it in the heart.

14:09.588 --> 14:11.556
That doesn't belong.

14:11.590 --> 14:13.358
It's aftermarket.

14:13.392 --> 14:15.326
Voids the warranty.

14:16.695 --> 14:18.830
Well, lucky for
you, Mr. Li's dead.

14:21.133 --> 14:22.333
Here you go,

14:22.368 --> 14:24.502
Ms. Rivera.

14:25.771 --> 14:27.939
The heart is registered
to a Sylvia Golinski.

14:31.076 --> 14:33.144
She passed away two years ago.

14:33.179 --> 14:35.113
What happens when someone dies?

14:35.147 --> 14:36.381
What then?

14:36.415 --> 14:39.083
The funeral home destroys
the bio-mech organ,

14:39.118 --> 14:40.285
then sends us verification

14:40.319 --> 14:41.553
that it's been destroyed.

14:41.587 --> 14:43.688
And how is it verified?

14:43.722 --> 14:45.356
Well, they send us a...

14:47.693 --> 14:49.727
...document.

14:49.762 --> 14:51.729
Oh. That's failsafe.

14:51.764 --> 14:55.099
We're gonna need that document.

15:16.388 --> 15:19.190
Oh. Doctor, thank God.

15:21.594 --> 15:23.661
Amelia.

15:23.696 --> 15:25.063
I'm Dr. Keating.

15:25.097 --> 15:27.432
I believe
I can find you a heart.

16:05.638 --> 16:07.939
Henry Mills?

16:07.973 --> 16:09.107
Detective Kennex.

16:09.141 --> 16:10.341
We're investigating

16:10.376 --> 16:12.777
the cremation
of a woman here two years ago.

16:12.811 --> 16:14.579
Ms. Sylvia Golinski.

16:18.450 --> 16:20.118
You're cops.

16:20.152 --> 16:21.953
I know you know
how many people die every day.

16:21.954 --> 16:23.588
We also know statute

16:23.622 --> 16:27.759
92-601-11B requires you
to keep permanent records.

16:27.793 --> 16:30.561
This is a letter to the
Vastrel Corporation, confirming

16:30.596 --> 16:32.997
the destruction of
Mrs. Golinski's bio-mech heart.

16:33.032 --> 16:35.767
With your signature.

16:35.801 --> 16:39.337
We have to take
out any inorganic parts

16:39.371 --> 16:40.672
and destroy them.

16:40.706 --> 16:42.573
Otherwise,
they mess up the machine.

16:42.608 --> 16:47.578
But you didn't destroy
Ms. Golinski's heart... Henry.

16:47.613 --> 16:50.248
We found it...
in someone else's body.

16:50.282 --> 16:54.118
You might want to tell us
how it got there.

16:55.954 --> 16:58.056
I sold it.

16:59.191 --> 17:00.692
How many have you sold?

17:00.726 --> 17:02.126
A lot.

17:02.161 --> 17:03.961
Over the years...

17:05.830 --> 17:06.964
...a hundred?

17:06.999 --> 17:08.098
A hundred?

17:08.133 --> 17:09.233
It's only

17:09.268 --> 17:10.401
illegal so the people

17:10.435 --> 17:12.369
who manufacture them
can make more money.

17:12.404 --> 17:13.938
Do you refurbish the hearts?

17:13.972 --> 17:15.339
When I find one,

17:15.374 --> 17:16.607
I make a call.

17:16.642 --> 17:17.575
Who answers?

17:17.608 --> 17:18.710
Oscar answers,

17:18.743 --> 17:19.877
a guy named Oscar.

17:19.912 --> 17:21.179
I don't know his last name.

17:21.213 --> 17:22.512
Showed up here,

17:22.548 --> 17:25.148
offered to buy any
bio-mech hearts I came across.

17:25.184 --> 17:27.117
Said he knew people
who needed them.

17:27.152 --> 17:30.988
That because of me,
they'd be staying alive longer.

17:31.023 --> 17:34.525
And these perfectly good hearts
are going in the trash anyway.

17:34.560 --> 17:37.729
Just because something is used

17:37.763 --> 17:40.231
doesn't mean it's got no value.

17:40.265 --> 17:43.401
He comes by, makes the pick-up,

17:43.435 --> 17:45.136
and pays me.

17:48.841 --> 17:50.308
Kennex.

17:50.342 --> 17:52.143
I checked into
Leonard Li's financials.

17:52.177 --> 17:53.678
On the 15th of every month,

17:53.712 --> 17:55.646
he makes a transfer
to an unmarked account.

17:55.681 --> 17:56.914
Always for the same amount...

17:56.949 --> 17:58.249
15 grand.

17:58.283 --> 17:59.650
For how long?

17:59.685 --> 18:01.786
It's been going on for 25 months
like clockwork.

18:01.820 --> 18:03.020
All right. Keep looking.

18:03.055 --> 18:04.155
Did Rudy reach you?

18:04.189 --> 18:05.490
No. Why?

18:05.524 --> 18:07.925
John, I think I know
what their function is.

18:07.960 --> 18:09.227
The modifications?

18:09.261 --> 18:13.364
Yeah. This is a custom version
of a terahertz

18:13.399 --> 18:14.799
frequency transponder
and limiter.

18:14.833 --> 18:16.000
Okay.

18:16.034 --> 18:17.301
What it does,

18:17.336 --> 18:19.437
what all of these little mods
working together do...

18:19.471 --> 18:21.072
they limit how long
the heart will function.

18:21.106 --> 18:22.573
So, effectively, it's a timer.

18:22.608 --> 18:24.075
Exactly.

18:24.109 --> 18:26.511
The timer would count down
precisely 30 days.

18:26.545 --> 18:28.146
Unless someone
resets it remotely,

18:28.180 --> 18:30.615
at the end of the 30 days,
it would stop.

18:30.649 --> 18:32.016
The mods shut down the organ.

18:32.050 --> 18:33.518
That's what
they're designed to do.

18:33.552 --> 18:35.353
Whoever gave Mr. Li this heart

18:35.387 --> 18:36.821
did not reset it for him.

18:36.855 --> 18:38.356
That's what he meant at

18:38.390 --> 18:41.893
the emergency room,
when he said, "They killed me."

18:43.162 --> 18:45.630
And he was right.

18:45.664 --> 18:47.799
Rudy, there could be more than
a hundred of them out there.

18:47.833 --> 18:49.767
This is an extortion racket.

18:49.802 --> 18:51.869
They're all on borrowed time.

18:58.810 --> 19:00.210
Henry?

19:00.245 --> 19:02.279
You're gonna call Oscar,

19:02.313 --> 19:03.881
tell him it's time
for a pickup.

19:03.915 --> 19:06.583
I'll help in any way I can.

19:08.620 --> 19:10.554
North side's still clear.

19:10.588 --> 19:12.589
Standing by.

19:15.126 --> 19:17.161
Can you stop with the
light show back there?

19:17.195 --> 19:18.695
I'm running
through my files.

19:18.730 --> 19:22.599
I don't understand
why I'm not a cop anymore.

19:24.102 --> 19:26.804
Why was I decommissioned?

19:32.977 --> 19:35.546
There were some problems
with our model.

19:35.580 --> 19:39.283
We were considered
emotionally unstable.

19:39.317 --> 19:43.720
Some went so far
as to call us... crazy.

19:43.755 --> 19:45.856
Still holding on
to that one, huh?

19:45.890 --> 19:48.158
How did they know

19:48.193 --> 19:50.094
which of us...

19:50.128 --> 19:52.896
was unstable?

19:52.931 --> 19:55.766
They designed a test.

19:55.800 --> 19:57.734
It's called the Luger test.

19:57.769 --> 20:00.571
To weed out faulty DRNs.

20:02.907 --> 20:06.343
But the powers that be
got nervous.

20:06.377 --> 20:08.946
Gave up on fixing
the flawed DRNs.

20:08.980 --> 20:10.914
Decommissioned us all,

20:10.949 --> 20:14.284
and replaced us with the MXs.

20:16.254 --> 20:19.423
But truthfully,

20:19.457 --> 20:23.127
I don't know if the Luger test
was accurate at all.

20:37.709 --> 20:41.278
Where the hell
is this guy Kennex?

20:41.312 --> 20:43.780
Henry, you better not
be wasting our time.

20:43.815 --> 20:46.250
Yeah, well, I said he'd show.
I never said he was punctual.

20:46.284 --> 20:48.619
He will be here.
Just be patient.

20:48.653 --> 20:51.155
Did they ever
do that thermal upgrade?

20:51.189 --> 20:53.257
Yup. Here,
check this out.

20:55.160 --> 20:56.894
They updated these, too.

20:56.928 --> 20:57.861
You're kidding me.

20:57.896 --> 20:59.863
They're removable
remote cameras now.

20:59.898 --> 21:01.798
- What's the range, man?
- Few hundred meters.

21:01.833 --> 21:03.133
You guys are killing me.

21:07.705 --> 21:09.740
Oh.

21:30.361 --> 21:33.530
- Oscar.
- Hey, man.

21:33.565 --> 21:35.032
You ready for me?

21:35.066 --> 21:36.900
Yeah.

21:36.935 --> 21:38.835
Just one today.

21:54.986 --> 21:57.054
Thanks.

22:00.658 --> 22:02.826
See ya.

22:11.769 --> 22:14.271
Aerial drone engaged.

22:14.305 --> 22:16.440
Thermal tracking online.

22:29.254 --> 22:32.256
He's parked outside
the back of a warehouse.

22:32.290 --> 22:34.825
I'll take the south side.
You cover the entrance.

22:34.859 --> 22:37.361
2-5-20.
Drone tracking has confirmed

22:37.395 --> 22:40.330
suspect has entered
the building.

22:45.270 --> 22:47.971
The building structure
is blocking the thermal.

22:48.006 --> 22:49.773
I don't know
how many are in there.

22:49.807 --> 22:50.907
Directions were good

22:50.942 --> 22:53.443
this time.
Can you turn it up?

22:56.314 --> 22:58.382
You're late.

22:59.651 --> 23:01.752
Give it here.

23:03.087 --> 23:05.622
Team 110-21, we are affirmative

23:05.657 --> 23:07.724
for tactical approach.

23:10.328 --> 23:12.262
In position and waiting
for orders, sir.

23:12.297 --> 23:14.398
Copy that.

23:14.432 --> 23:16.366
What are we waiting for?
Let's get in there.

23:16.401 --> 23:17.601
Yeah, just sit tight.

23:17.635 --> 23:19.736
Let the *** do its work.

23:45.530 --> 23:47.631
Bring me the bath.

23:48.599 --> 23:50.734
Bring it here.

23:52.637 --> 23:54.604
Don't spill any.

23:55.640 --> 23:58.508
Can I watch while you cut her?

23:58.543 --> 24:00.744
- They're doing a transplant.
- Go, go, go.

24:04.549 --> 24:05.916
- Finally!
- No.

24:05.950 --> 24:07.484
- You stay there.
- You sure? I...

24:07.518 --> 24:09.453
Stay in the car.

24:09.487 --> 24:10.520
Police!
Don't move!

24:10.555 --> 24:11.655
Everybody down!

24:11.689 --> 24:12.889
Move!

24:12.924 --> 24:14.624
Get your hands up! Let me
see those hands! You, too.

24:14.659 --> 24:15.859
Put your hands
behind your back!

24:15.893 --> 24:17.527
- You, too, let's go.
- All right.

24:17.562 --> 24:19.162
Let's go, go, go.

24:19.197 --> 24:20.831
On your knees,
hands on your head.

24:20.865 --> 24:21.865
Behind your back!

24:21.899 --> 24:23.900
I'm with you.

24:23.935 --> 24:26.636
Ma'am, can you hear me?

24:26.671 --> 24:29.206
Ma'am, open your eyes.
Can you hear me?

24:29.240 --> 24:31.808
What have you done?

24:31.843 --> 24:34.177
I need that heart to live.

24:34.212 --> 24:36.012
What have you done?

24:36.047 --> 24:37.647
What have you done?

24:48.676 --> 24:51.778
These interrogations
may take a while.

24:51.812 --> 24:54.347
Uh, that's okay, I, um...

24:54.381 --> 24:57.250
I won't rearrange anything.

25:10.664 --> 25:14.033
Did you reset the timers
for number 47 and 36 yet?

25:14.068 --> 25:15.635
No, as per your instruction.

25:15.669 --> 25:17.637
The cops are all around us.

25:17.671 --> 25:19.672
We need to shut down.

25:19.707 --> 25:21.941
Don't reset anyone...
destroy everything

25:21.975 --> 25:24.143
and get out of there.

25:26.513 --> 25:28.147
Just tell me what you
need me to tell you

25:28.182 --> 25:30.817
so I can get the hell of here...
tell me what you need to know.

25:30.851 --> 25:32.251
I'd love to know
why you think you're

25:32.286 --> 25:33.886
walking the hell out of here
with those priors.

25:33.921 --> 25:35.955
But right now, Rasputin,

25:35.989 --> 25:38.925
- let's start with... how'd you get
involved in this? - I deliver

25:38.959 --> 25:41.928
things... I am a courier,
I work for a lot of people,

25:41.962 --> 25:45.498
- I don't ask questions. - Maybe
this time you should have.

25:46.867 --> 25:50.169
What are you looking
over there for?

25:50.204 --> 25:52.004
You afraid of the doctor?
Is that who hired you?

25:52.039 --> 25:54.006
Is he the one who arranges

25:54.041 --> 25:56.542
the sale of the hearts?

25:56.577 --> 25:59.679
You think you saved
me from something?

26:00.814 --> 26:03.116
You killed me.

26:05.652 --> 26:08.254
Amelia...

26:08.288 --> 26:10.356
if you had gotten that heart,
they would have

26:10.391 --> 26:12.425
doubled the payment
and then tripled it,

26:12.459 --> 26:17.063
till you couldn't pay it, and then
they would have turned yours off, too.

26:19.299 --> 26:21.768
I just want more time

26:21.802 --> 26:23.936
with my family.

26:27.341 --> 26:29.709
Wouldn't you?

26:32.379 --> 26:34.981
Yeah.

26:38.752 --> 26:41.314
People are calling.
They're trying to pay us.

26:41.358 --> 26:42.427
We should reset them.

26:42.454 --> 26:43.756
They might be able to trace
the reset signal back to you.

26:43.791 --> 26:46.125
They've got the doctor
and they've got the courier.

26:46.160 --> 26:47.427
I'm afraid.

26:47.461 --> 26:49.595
Do you have any idea
what kind of sentence comes

26:49.630 --> 26:51.364
with running an
organ-trafficking ring?

26:51.398 --> 26:54.233
I'm not running anything.

26:54.268 --> 26:55.401
Then who is?

26:56.370 --> 26:58.471
Someone who cares about people,

26:58.505 --> 27:01.073
regardless of
how much money they have.

27:01.108 --> 27:04.310
Tell me about this woman, Andrea, who
hired you to transport the hearts.

27:04.344 --> 27:07.146
- She called me, wanted to use my service.
- You never asked

27:07.181 --> 27:09.248
- what it was you were transporting?
- A kilo

27:09.283 --> 27:10.750
of metal meth.
I don't want to know.

27:10.784 --> 27:12.852
Mob money.
I could care less.

27:12.886 --> 27:14.687
Long as I'm paid.

27:14.721 --> 27:16.522
Okay, okay,
how <i>do</i> you get paid?

27:16.557 --> 27:18.624
Monthly retainer
transferred to my account.

27:18.659 --> 27:20.827
- And when did this arrangement start?
- Three years ago.

27:20.861 --> 27:22.061
Point is,

27:22.095 --> 27:24.831
I do not know these people.

27:24.865 --> 27:26.966
I want to go home.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.268
I am tired.

27:29.303 --> 27:30.803
They're too close.

27:30.838 --> 27:33.873
If they get to me, you're
going down, too, remember that.

27:33.907 --> 27:35.174
Shut down.

27:35.209 --> 27:36.509
Are you at home?

27:36.543 --> 27:39.645
Yes.

27:39.680 --> 27:41.547
I'll be there shortly.

27:52.993 --> 27:54.994
The comm you are
contacting is not available.

27:55.028 --> 27:57.263
Where are you?

27:57.297 --> 27:59.265
You can't just leave me.

27:59.299 --> 28:00.666
You know what will happen.

28:00.701 --> 28:03.035
<i>Don't you see
what I'm doing here?</i>

28:03.070 --> 28:04.637
<i>I'm helping people.</i>

28:04.671 --> 28:08.574
Yeah, you know, I'd almost
go with you on that...

28:08.609 --> 28:11.944
except for the mods that
you put on the hearts.

28:11.979 --> 28:15.448
You know... timers
which run out to zero.

28:15.482 --> 28:18.751
- What are you talking about? - You modify
the hearts, then you put them in people.

28:18.785 --> 28:20.653
When they can't pay you
what you want,

28:20.687 --> 28:22.889
you let the timers run out
and they die.

28:22.923 --> 28:24.524
That is not true.

28:24.558 --> 28:26.259
Those mods are
for remote diagnostics,

28:26.293 --> 28:28.761
in case any problems
arise. W-We...

28:28.795 --> 28:30.530
we can...

28:30.564 --> 28:33.533
Is that what they told
you, Dr. Keating?

28:43.544 --> 28:46.045
Look, I understand.

28:46.079 --> 28:49.148
You were manipulated.

28:49.182 --> 28:51.617
It's not easy to accept that.

28:51.652 --> 28:55.321
Now, don't you want a chance
to make that right?

28:57.791 --> 29:00.092
Her name is Karen.

29:00.127 --> 29:04.630
The comm you are
contacting is not available.

29:14.241 --> 29:15.675
The woman looks real.

29:15.709 --> 29:18.077
They all only know her
Karen.

29:18.111 --> 29:19.378
She's compartmentalized
her entire operation.

29:19.413 --> 29:21.714
Nobody knows
anything more than they have to.

29:21.748 --> 29:23.516
Yeah, but we broke the chain.

29:23.550 --> 29:25.117
She's got to know that
we're looking at her.

29:31.959 --> 29:33.092
There's a lot of money involved.

29:33.126 --> 29:34.594
If she's smart
she'll fold up her tent.

29:34.628 --> 29:36.729
If that happens, and other
people's bills come due...

29:38.031 --> 29:40.766
...there'll be no one there
to reset their hearts.

29:44.638 --> 29:47.006
<i>Because we're doing our jobs,</i>

29:47.040 --> 29:48.975
they're gonna die.

30:27.696 --> 30:30.197
It's another Vastrel Alpha.

30:33.668 --> 30:37.004
My mother used
to hide money in her sock.

30:43.044 --> 30:45.012
Bit coin.

30:45.046 --> 30:47.081
Totally untraceable.

30:47.115 --> 30:49.116
How much has she got on there?

30:51.753 --> 30:54.321
4,999.

30:54.356 --> 30:56.223
She <i>was</i> going
to make her payment.

30:56.258 --> 30:58.392
They didn't care.

30:58.426 --> 31:00.461
We were right.

31:02.464 --> 31:04.832
They're shutting down.

31:04.866 --> 31:08.903
A sudden cardiac arrest.
65-year-old male. Took a scan.

31:08.937 --> 31:11.939
It's another Vastrel Alpha.
The wife's here,

31:11.973 --> 31:13.707
but she's been sedated.

31:13.742 --> 31:15.342
She's still in shock.

31:15.377 --> 31:17.411
How long
before I can talk to her?

31:17.445 --> 31:18.712
At least an hour.

31:18.747 --> 31:20.281
All right. Thank you.

31:43.405 --> 31:45.539
Kennex.

31:45.574 --> 31:47.641
I found something
they have in common.

31:47.676 --> 31:48.909
They all applied for transplants

31:48.944 --> 31:50.778
through Vastrel's
in-house aid program.

31:50.812 --> 31:53.280
- Okay. - The four victims
we've ID'd so far

31:53.315 --> 31:55.482
and Amelia, our patient,

31:55.517 --> 31:57.751
all of them were rejected due
to lack of insurance

31:57.786 --> 31:59.920
by the same case administrator.

31:59.955 --> 32:03.257
What if someone is using
the list of rejected applicants

32:03.291 --> 32:05.292
to target buyers
for secondhand hearts?

32:05.327 --> 32:06.961
Who is the administrator?

32:06.995 --> 32:08.529
Pauline Rivera.

32:14.336 --> 32:17.738
- Detective Kennex. - When people
apply to Vastrel's aid program,

32:17.772 --> 32:19.473
you handle their cases, correct?

32:19.507 --> 32:21.075
Yes.

32:21.109 --> 32:23.143
What's this about?

32:25.580 --> 32:27.281
Is this the woman
who approached you?

32:29.217 --> 32:31.285
No.

32:31.319 --> 32:33.854
Are you sure?

32:33.888 --> 32:35.756
That's not her.

32:38.693 --> 32:41.173
Detective, I assure you I have
done nothing but...

32:43.298 --> 32:46.300
He says she's not the one.

32:46.334 --> 32:47.835
Does anyone else have access

32:47.869 --> 32:50.204
to the list
of people denied transplant?

32:50.238 --> 32:52.006
Only I have the decryption key.

32:55.944 --> 32:58.012
Where is your assistant?

32:58.046 --> 32:59.446
Jacinta.

33:02.550 --> 33:03.651
That's her.

33:17.132 --> 33:19.300
Scan the house.

33:27.542 --> 33:29.643
John...

33:40.121 --> 33:42.389
Floor is warm.

33:42.424 --> 33:45.492
That's what my thermal
was picking up.

33:48.663 --> 33:50.497
What is that?

33:50.532 --> 33:52.833
A chemical reaction.

33:52.867 --> 33:55.469
Molecular chlorine
breaking down blood.

33:55.503 --> 33:57.171
This room's been washed.

33:57.205 --> 33:59.740
- There should be more.
- More blood?

33:59.774 --> 34:01.141
More bodies.

34:01.176 --> 34:03.977
Dr. Keating said this has
been going on for a long time.

34:04.012 --> 34:06.513
It's kind of hard to believe
that every single recipient

34:06.548 --> 34:08.282
was able to keep making
their payments, right?

34:08.315 --> 34:10.284
So you're saying someone
must've been "turned off"

34:10.318 --> 34:11.452
before Leonard.

34:11.485 --> 34:13.320
Probably more than one.

34:13.355 --> 34:14.922
So why haven't any more bodies

34:14.956 --> 34:16.657
with modded secondhand hearts
shown up?

34:16.690 --> 34:18.826
- Good question.
- Here's a better one.

34:18.860 --> 34:21.161
These assets are expensive
and lucrative.

34:21.196 --> 34:23.464
If someone stops paying,
you don't just flush an asset

34:23.498 --> 34:24.931
like that down the drain,
do you?

34:24.966 --> 34:27.634
P.D. has no records
of bodies recovered

34:27.668 --> 34:31.138
with hearts missing
for the last three years.

34:31.172 --> 34:32.505
Try missing persons.

34:32.540 --> 34:34.942
Cross-reference with the list of
patients denied Vastrel hearts.

34:34.976 --> 34:38.112
I have 36 matches found already.

34:39.280 --> 34:41.882
No bodies recovered
in any of these cases.

34:41.916 --> 34:45.219
Who do we know
who gets rid of bodies?

35:02.663 --> 35:04.431
Call the drone for backup.

35:05.333 --> 35:07.033
Listen to me.

35:07.068 --> 35:09.436
You can be valuable
to me out here.

35:09.470 --> 35:12.339
You see anyone come out here...

35:12.373 --> 35:14.607
you follow protocol
and you stop them.

35:15.810 --> 35:17.377
Just connect with me now, jump

35:17.411 --> 35:20.680
on my system, and you'll have
protocol at your fingertips.

35:21.816 --> 35:22.682
Come on.

35:24.185 --> 35:26.353
- Take it. - I can't.
- It's okay.

35:26.387 --> 35:27.520
I trust you.

35:32.026 --> 35:36.029
I'm terrified, Dorian.

35:38.766 --> 35:40.233
I'm sorry.

35:41.402 --> 35:43.169
Stay right here.

35:43.204 --> 35:44.671
I'll be right back.

36:10.464 --> 36:11.798
Don't move!

36:51.005 --> 36:53.139
Put him in a cube.

36:59.146 --> 37:01.014
You look pleased.

37:01.048 --> 37:03.917
I spoke to Ms. Rivera
at Vastrel.

37:03.951 --> 37:05.585
They've offered
to replace every one

37:05.619 --> 37:07.387
of the secondhand hearts
at no cost.

37:07.421 --> 37:11.524
Well, one of their employees was
involved in an extortion racket.

37:11.559 --> 37:13.593
They're just covering
their asses.

37:13.627 --> 37:14.627
Yeah.

37:17.631 --> 37:19.966
Still makes me happy
to see the result.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.503
Yeah. It's a good result.

37:28.275 --> 37:31.411
Haven't seen your model
in a while.

37:33.647 --> 37:35.515
Probably think
it's amusing, huh?

37:35.549 --> 37:38.952
All us humans running around...

37:38.986 --> 37:42.222
trying to get more time.

37:48.162 --> 37:51.297
Must be nice to have all
the time in the world.

38:00.441 --> 38:03.076
What are you doing?

38:03.110 --> 38:05.578
I was looking at my cases.

38:05.613 --> 38:09.883
This case in particular, 4378.

38:09.917 --> 38:13.186
A woman's boyfriend was
in the house alone

38:13.220 --> 38:15.889
with the woman's son,
a little boy.

38:15.923 --> 38:17.957
There was a standoff, and, um,

38:17.992 --> 38:20.593
the woman's boyfriend
wanted to...

38:22.630 --> 38:25.331
...kill the little boy
with a shotgun.

38:27.902 --> 38:30.303
I used my thermal imaging
to track the location

38:30.337 --> 38:31.571
of the little boy.

38:31.605 --> 38:34.641
He was hiding
underneath the sink.

38:34.675 --> 38:37.677
And the boyfriend
kept looking for him.

38:37.711 --> 38:40.914
I knew it was just a matter
of time before he found him.

38:43.484 --> 38:44.984
I broke protocol.

38:45.019 --> 38:47.086
I went into that house

38:47.121 --> 38:49.589
and I killed him.

38:52.860 --> 38:56.396
When I found the little boy...

38:56.430 --> 39:00.633
he looked up at me...

39:00.668 --> 39:03.870
and he just hugged me
for a long time.

39:07.474 --> 39:10.143
His name was Philip.

39:14.848 --> 39:18.618
That look was the most
human connection I've ever had.

39:22.623 --> 39:26.893
That was my proudest moment
as a cop.

39:30.798 --> 39:33.399
I didn't realize
how much I missed that.

39:33.434 --> 39:35.568
So thank you.

39:37.004 --> 39:38.237
Down in the 42nd.

39:38.272 --> 39:41.140
Yes, and...

39:42.676 --> 39:45.078
Kennex!

40:03.664 --> 40:05.398
Thank you.

40:09.236 --> 40:12.705
I appreciate
what you did for me today.

40:12.740 --> 40:15.541
You're an incredible cop.

40:15.576 --> 40:18.778
I'm sorry you couldn't
have been one for longer.

40:31.992 --> 40:34.193
Do you remember your precinct?

40:35.062 --> 40:36.663
No.

40:36.697 --> 40:39.198
Do you remember any
of your cases?

40:41.101 --> 40:42.502
No.

40:42.536 --> 40:45.905
Do you remember a boy?

40:45.939 --> 40:47.573
Called Philip.

40:47.608 --> 40:49.642
A young boy.

40:52.513 --> 40:54.647
Yeah.

40:56.817 --> 40:58.885
Good.

41:18.138 --> 41:20.139
You okay?

41:20.174 --> 41:23.743
You know what would
make me feel better?

41:24.578 --> 41:26.212
