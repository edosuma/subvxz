WEBVTT

02:25.782 --> 02:26.715
- No.

02:26.750 --> 02:28.552
- Checkmate.

02:28.587 --> 02:29.784
- Unbelievable.

02:29.819 --> 02:31.357
- Did you lose or win?

02:32.294 --> 02:33.623
- I lost.

02:33.658 --> 02:34.855
- Do you play the game?

02:34.890 --> 02:36.593
- I do not play the game.

02:36.628 --> 02:37.891
- You do not play the game.

02:37.926 --> 02:39.365
- Can't you tell?

02:39.400 --> 02:40.927
That's why I lost.
- I can tell.

02:40.962 --> 02:42.434
I mean, I like the way you
move the pieces around,

02:42.469 --> 02:44.931
but I mean, you're
actually playing a game?

02:44.966 --> 02:46.504
- I am doing my very best.

02:46.539 --> 02:48.737
- Oh my God, you did
poorly, trust me.

02:48.772 --> 02:50.838
- I think he
played the game.

02:50.873 --> 02:52.774
- And Marcus, let me
ask you a question.

02:52.809 --> 02:54.545
Would you say

02:54.580 --> 02:57.009
that this whole location's
a little out of the way,

02:57.044 --> 02:58.714
even for you?

02:58.749 --> 03:00.287
- Well.

03:00.322 --> 03:01.915
If you're looking
for Kodiak bears,

03:01.950 --> 03:03.587
there's only one place to go.

03:04.788 --> 03:06.953
- And you've said that before,

03:06.988 --> 03:09.890
but what I don't understand
is what makes 'em so special.

03:11.093 --> 03:15.896
- They can stand 10 feet tall,
weigh up to 1,500 pounds,

03:15.931 --> 03:17.898
run 30 miles an hour,

03:17.933 --> 03:20.868
climb any tree that
can hold their weight,

03:20.903 --> 03:24.740
they're not afraid of man,
and they like how we taste.

03:26.414 --> 03:27.743
- And do they have guns?

03:30.847 --> 03:32.352
- The bears?

03:32.387 --> 03:32.979
- Yeah.

03:33.014 --> 03:34.552
- Come on, Whit.

03:34.587 --> 03:36.323
What are you talking about?

03:36.358 --> 03:38.050
- Well, you want it to be
a fair fight, don't you?

03:38.085 --> 03:40.294
How's it a fair fight
if he's not armed?

03:40.329 --> 03:44.958
- Oh, oh, so, so an unarmed
man fighting a Kodiak bear

03:44.993 --> 03:45.926
is a fair fight?

03:46.895 --> 03:48.764
- It's a fight a hell
of a lot of people,

03:48.799 --> 03:50.062
including myself and you,

03:50.097 --> 03:51.866
would pay a lot
of bucks to watch.

03:51.901 --> 03:55.507
Even him with the tacky
sweater on would pay to see it.

03:55.542 --> 03:56.970
- My wife bought me this sweater

03:57.005 --> 03:59.478
and hunting is the best
sport in the world.

03:59.513 --> 04:01.843
- Well, for the hunter, for you.

04:01.878 --> 04:04.747
You enjoy hunting, you
enjoy that part of it

04:04.782 --> 04:06.386
when the bear's looking at you

04:06.421 --> 04:08.454
and you don't think
he feels pain,

04:08.489 --> 04:10.621
or you don't think he feels fear

04:10.656 --> 04:14.020
or any goddamn thing like that,
like every other human being

04:14.055 --> 04:16.759
or every other being
at all that's alive?

04:16.794 --> 04:19.960
- Look, you can humanize
the bear all you like.

04:19.995 --> 04:21.599
But at the end of the day,

04:21.634 --> 04:23.898
it's just looking at
us as their next meal.

04:23.933 --> 04:25.933
- Let me ask you a question.

04:25.968 --> 04:28.804
Are you trying to tell
me when you're armed

04:28.839 --> 04:32.346
and you're heading for a bear

04:32.381 --> 04:35.811
that he doesn't know
what you're up to?

04:35.846 --> 04:39.650
That he doesn't
know for a second

04:39.685 --> 04:43.753
that you might kill
him and take his life?

04:43.788 --> 04:48.791
- Whit, the Kodiak bear
is a cunning predator,

04:50.531 --> 04:51.827
an apex killer,

04:53.061 --> 04:56.898
but almost all of his
behavior is instinctual.

04:59.001 --> 05:00.671
The only circumstance
that might provide him

05:00.706 --> 05:02.838
with a, you know,
current lesson,

05:03.907 --> 05:05.445
mating season maybe.

05:05.480 --> 05:06.105
- Mating season.

05:07.647 --> 05:08.613
I'll drink to that.

05:11.145 --> 05:12.012
- Okay.

05:13.983 --> 05:15.785
I'll drink to that,

05:15.820 --> 05:17.424
but how many drinks have you
had while we're counting?

05:17.459 --> 05:18.986
- This is my very first one.

05:19.021 --> 05:20.922
- You
lying piece of shit.

05:20.957 --> 05:23.991
- And by the way, I
couldn't see your point earlier.

05:24.026 --> 05:25.399
- Sanger.

05:25.434 --> 05:26.059
Did we wake you?

05:27.535 --> 05:28.897
- No, Father, I'm okay.

05:28.932 --> 05:30.767
- Bad dreams?

05:30.802 --> 05:31.834
- No.

05:31.869 --> 05:33.407
Maybe.

05:33.442 --> 05:34.441
- How about a drink?

05:34.476 --> 05:35.805
- Yeah.

05:35.840 --> 05:37.411
- I got an extra one
always on standby.

05:37.446 --> 05:38.071
- Okay, yeah.

05:39.910 --> 05:43.912
So we past the island yet?

05:43.947 --> 05:44.946
- No, sir.

05:44.981 --> 05:45.782
- Soon.

05:48.853 --> 05:51.755
- What is it about this island
that's got you all nervous?

05:52.857 --> 05:55.561
- Its reputation, bad one.

05:55.596 --> 05:57.431
- It's mostly rumor
and superstition.

05:59.028 --> 06:00.599
- Does anybody notice

06:00.634 --> 06:01.798
how the captain's
nerves have been shaky

06:01.833 --> 06:03.129
while on this voyage?

06:03.164 --> 06:04.702
Saw the charts we drew up

06:04.737 --> 06:06.099
and he knew where
we're headed wasn't

06:06.134 --> 06:07.474
for the faint of heart.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.477
- Don't question this
captain's courage.

06:11.942 --> 06:13.810
I know he seems
like an old prick

06:13.845 --> 06:16.681
and he doesn't know what he's
doing and he may be afraid,

06:16.716 --> 06:19.046
but even afraid, he'd go
right up to the devil,

06:19.081 --> 06:23.919
look him in the eye, and
say, "Give me a light, bud."

06:25.890 --> 06:26.757
That's who he is.

06:27.958 --> 06:29.925
- Captain was acting
a bit funny earlier.

06:31.027 --> 06:32.466
Some of the crew as well.

06:33.964 --> 06:35.469
He is afraid of something.

06:36.934 --> 06:39.066
- Probably rumor
masquerading as fact.

06:41.004 --> 06:43.576
- No, I felt it.

06:44.975 --> 06:46.678
I was out on the rail earlier.

06:47.615 --> 06:48.845
There was no breeze.

06:51.619 --> 06:54.950
As if there was a poisonous
sensation in the air,

06:56.591 --> 06:59.053
chill and wet feeling
that stuck to me.

06:59.088 --> 07:01.792
- Well, buy a fucking
coat, Jesus Christ.

07:02.729 --> 07:03.794
You're shit-faced.

07:03.829 --> 07:05.895
- No.
- Oh, you're shit-faced.

07:05.930 --> 07:06.995
Oh, come on.

07:07.030 --> 07:08.733
- No, first one, first drink.

07:08.768 --> 07:10.262
- Go to nappy's house.

07:10.297 --> 07:11.098
- Okay.

07:25.147 --> 07:27.048
- Mr. Rainsford.
- Captain.

07:27.083 --> 07:30.051
- We've sounded two horns for
we're about in the bottleneck.

07:30.086 --> 07:31.921
- Bottleneck?

07:31.956 --> 07:34.022
- That's right. The only way
to go at it from this way is

07:34.057 --> 07:37.058
to come close to the island,

07:37.093 --> 07:39.830
sliding through the
bottleneck between the island

07:39.865 --> 07:42.965
and a large reef,
shoals all around.

07:44.870 --> 07:46.606
We've slowed to a crawl.

07:46.641 --> 07:48.102
In 30 minutes, it'll be
the shallows of the island

07:48.137 --> 07:50.775
to the left and nothing
but reef to the right.

07:51.911 --> 07:55.879
The island's beaches will
be no more than 100 meters

07:55.914 --> 07:59.784
from our port side, so if you
believe in a God, gentlemen,

08:01.117 --> 08:01.984
start praying to him.

08:03.152 --> 08:05.922
- Thank you.
- Thank you, captain.

08:05.957 --> 08:07.253
- Thank you.

08:10.291 --> 08:13.699
- There's still time to turn
the boat and go around, sir.

08:13.734 --> 08:15.327
- We already had
this discussion.

08:15.362 --> 08:17.967
We don't have the three
days to go around the island

08:18.002 --> 08:22.037
and I'm not gonna let
superstition rule the day.

08:22.072 --> 08:23.577
Thank you.

08:23.612 --> 08:25.810
- I hope the hunt is
worth it, Mr. Rainsford.

08:31.147 --> 08:32.553
- He's lost his nerve.

08:33.853 --> 08:35.182
- Like I said.

08:35.217 --> 08:37.052
Hey, Sanger, you
find God in that war?

08:38.088 --> 08:39.725
- No, sir.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.056
God left us to die there.

08:44.292 --> 08:45.225
I'm going back to bed.

08:45.260 --> 08:46.325
- Sanger, one second.

08:48.802 --> 08:52.837
Throughout history, men have
done horrible things to men

08:52.872 --> 08:54.168
for a myriad of reasons.

08:55.875 --> 09:00.647
Do not let your war
experience control

09:00.682 --> 09:02.077
your whole life afterwards.

09:03.718 --> 09:05.685
The war is over, Sanger.

09:06.688 --> 09:07.588
Do you understand?

09:11.660 --> 09:13.220
- I appreciate the
effort, Father.

09:13.255 --> 09:14.089
I do.

09:16.797 --> 09:17.598
- Get some rest.

09:18.293 --> 09:19.633
Tomorrow's a big day.

09:22.935 --> 09:25.034
- Good
night, gentlemen.

09:25.069 --> 09:25.969
- Good night, son.

09:34.309 --> 09:35.880
- He'll be okay, Marcus.

09:35.915 --> 09:37.376
This trip will be good for him.

09:37.411 --> 09:38.311
- Yeah.

09:38.346 --> 09:41.149
Well, we shall see.

09:41.184 --> 09:42.117
- You'll see.

11:50.412 --> 11:52.214
- Sanger?

11:52.249 --> 11:53.182
Sanger!

11:53.217 --> 11:54.986
Oh, my boy, oh my God.

11:55.923 --> 11:57.186
Thought you were lost to me.

11:57.221 --> 11:58.352
Oh, my boy, my boy.

11:58.387 --> 11:59.859
Are you okay, are you okay?

11:59.894 --> 12:02.257
- I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

12:05.295 --> 12:06.558
What happened?

12:06.593 --> 12:08.395
- My best guess is
the boiler blew.

12:08.430 --> 12:10.397
Only thing that makes sense
in this kind of situation.

12:10.432 --> 12:12.003
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

12:12.038 --> 12:13.367
No, that doesn't make
any sense at all.

12:13.402 --> 12:14.434
There's no way the
captain hires people

12:14.469 --> 12:15.534
that can't maintain his boiler.

12:15.569 --> 12:17.140
It's gotta be something else.

12:17.175 --> 12:18.207
- Well, I'm at
a loss then, Marcus,

12:18.242 --> 12:19.538
because the only thing on a ship

12:19.573 --> 12:20.913
that should explode like
that is the boilers.

12:22.378 --> 12:24.114
- Captain Nielsen, where is he?

12:25.854 --> 12:27.414
Wait, Whit?

12:29.891 --> 12:31.286
- Drowned.

12:31.321 --> 12:32.188
Right next to me.

12:35.226 --> 12:37.160
- We don't know how long
we're gonna be here.

12:37.195 --> 12:39.327
We have to see what we
could salvage from the ship.

12:39.362 --> 12:43.067
Okay, we're gonna need
food stuff, fresh water.

12:43.102 --> 12:45.300
Okay, we're gonna need anything
we can use to build a fire,

12:45.335 --> 12:46.906
to maintain the fire.

12:46.941 --> 12:48.369
Maybe something we could
build a shelter out of.

12:48.404 --> 12:50.041
We need some rope

12:50.076 --> 12:51.405
and any sharp edged
instrument we can find.

12:51.440 --> 12:52.307
Okay, ready?

12:53.376 --> 12:54.408
Okay?

12:54.443 --> 12:55.442
- This is it, isn't it, Marcus?

12:55.477 --> 12:56.311
- Ah.

12:57.347 --> 12:59.083
Yes, this is it.

12:59.118 --> 13:01.514
- Well, maybe superstition
isn't so unbelievable after all.

13:01.549 --> 13:04.055
- Well, superstition
didn't blow up the boat.

13:06.521 --> 13:09.159
- There may be more survivors.

13:09.194 --> 13:10.996
- Okay, who is there?

13:11.031 --> 13:14.329
The three of us and Whitney,
the captain, four crewmen.

13:16.465 --> 13:18.498
- Two of the crew are dead.

13:18.533 --> 13:19.499
- How do you know that?

13:21.470 --> 13:23.338
- They washed on
the shore with me.

13:24.407 --> 13:25.241
- Damn.

13:30.545 --> 13:31.478
Marcus?

13:31.513 --> 13:32.919
- Yes, that was a rifle.

13:33.614 --> 13:35.053
Sounded like a...

13:35.088 --> 13:35.988
- A Mazda.

13:36.023 --> 13:37.286
- A Mazda, that's right.

13:37.321 --> 13:38.320
Well, that means there's
someone else here.

13:38.355 --> 13:39.486
This is good news.

13:40.687 --> 13:42.357
- Sure about that, Father?

13:42.392 --> 13:43.963
- Yeah.

13:43.998 --> 13:45.965
We're at the edge of the
Aleutian Territory, son.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.329
There's nobody out here.

13:47.364 --> 13:48.902
The fact we heard
another rifle means

13:48.937 --> 13:51.069
there's gotta be
another hunter, right?

13:52.974 --> 13:54.303
This is good,
there'll be a camp,

13:54.338 --> 13:57.405
there'll be food,
there'll be dry clothes.

13:57.440 --> 13:59.011
- Maybe there's a plane.

13:59.046 --> 14:00.111
Maybe there's a landing
strip somewhere.

14:00.146 --> 14:01.508
- That's right.

14:01.543 --> 14:04.049
- That rifle shot was
about a mile away.

14:04.084 --> 14:06.414
- You know, that rifle shot
was about half a mile away.

14:06.449 --> 14:07.547
We'd better go.

14:07.582 --> 14:08.614
Come on, come on, let's go.

14:08.649 --> 14:10.550
Let's go to the sound, come on.

14:10.585 --> 14:12.387
Come on, Sanger, we can do this.

14:12.422 --> 14:14.389
We can do it, Sanger,
we've got this.

14:45.323 --> 14:46.421
Something's been shot.

14:55.102 --> 14:56.497
- 7.9 millimeter.

14:58.237 --> 14:59.071
- Wowza.

15:01.174 --> 15:02.338
- What are they hunting?

15:03.506 --> 15:05.308
- Okay.

15:05.343 --> 15:06.672
Keep your eyes open.

15:06.707 --> 15:07.541
Pay attention.

15:30.632 --> 15:31.466
Oh.

15:34.108 --> 15:34.733
Civilization.

15:43.414 --> 15:44.479
- Not savages then.

15:45.548 --> 15:46.382
Good.

15:47.051 --> 15:49.055
I was beginning to get worried.

15:49.090 --> 15:51.486
- Oh, Rex, I didn't think
you were scared of anything.

15:52.522 --> 15:54.621
- Scared of my wife.

15:54.656 --> 15:56.557
She wants me back
home in one piece.

15:56.592 --> 15:57.492
- Okay.

16:00.365 --> 16:02.497
Let's see if we can get
off this island, huh?

16:25.522 --> 16:27.621
All right, they've got fire.

16:27.656 --> 16:30.195
- Okay, so you're right
again, they're not savages.

16:31.495 --> 16:32.626
Jesus!

16:35.631 --> 16:36.465
- Oh.

16:37.336 --> 16:38.731
We mean you no harm.

16:38.766 --> 16:39.699
We are unarmed.

16:41.538 --> 16:44.143
Our ship sank last night.

16:44.178 --> 16:47.179
We are marooned on your island?

16:48.743 --> 16:51.348
This is my friend, Rex Alan.

16:52.681 --> 16:53.746
That's my son Sanger.

16:53.781 --> 16:55.352
I am Marcus Rainsford.

16:58.291 --> 16:59.125
You are?

17:07.597 --> 17:08.431
- Welcome.

17:09.764 --> 17:11.236
I must assume you
are the survivors

17:11.271 --> 17:12.402
of the boat I
heard have a mishap

17:12.437 --> 17:13.568
in the middle of the night.

17:13.603 --> 17:14.602
- Yes.

17:14.637 --> 17:15.801
Yes, we are.

17:15.836 --> 17:17.572
- Please excuse Ivan there.

17:19.312 --> 17:20.146
He is a mute.

17:21.545 --> 17:23.545
And also deaf quite
a bit of the time.

17:25.483 --> 17:26.416
You must be hungry.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.486
Ivan will show you

17:30.521 --> 17:32.224
to what I hope will be
acceptable quarters.

17:32.259 --> 17:35.491
And we will discuss your
dilemma over dinner after a bit.

17:35.526 --> 17:37.163
- Thank you.

17:37.198 --> 17:39.495
- Most certainly I will
be able to help you.

17:39.530 --> 17:40.364
Excuse me.

17:50.706 --> 17:52.244
- You guys okay?

18:17.700 --> 18:19.304
Oh.

18:19.339 --> 18:21.141
- Isn't exactly
the Waldorf, is it?

18:23.211 --> 18:25.772
- This place is fine until
we get off the island, okay?

18:26.742 --> 18:28.445
- How you doing?

18:28.480 --> 18:30.777
- Something about this
place doesn't feel right.

18:30.812 --> 18:33.285
- So, what give it away for you?

18:34.288 --> 18:36.717
Frankenstein out there
or the casual demeanor

18:36.752 --> 18:38.917
in which our host
accepted us in?

18:38.952 --> 18:41.491
- Let's prepare for dinner.

19:05.385 --> 19:07.550
This is a beautiful moose.

19:11.424 --> 19:13.655
Should be hung on the wall.

19:13.690 --> 19:16.295
- Must have taken a few
shots to bring it down.

19:17.760 --> 19:19.826
- Yes, it was quite the task.

19:21.027 --> 19:23.434
- Did he charge you?

19:24.833 --> 19:27.966
- Held me against the
tree, fractured my skull.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.902
But at last, at
the end of the day,

19:29.937 --> 19:32.311
I proclaimed to be the victor.

19:32.346 --> 19:34.005
- Well, the moose is
a formidable opponent

19:34.040 --> 19:35.446
during mating season,

19:36.878 --> 19:40.517
but the most dangerous is
the Cape Water Buffalo.

19:40.552 --> 19:43.784
- Here at my preserve, I hunt
even more dangerous game.

19:43.819 --> 19:45.621
- No.

19:45.656 --> 19:48.492
- You have big game
here on the island?

19:48.527 --> 19:49.691
- The most dangerous.

19:50.628 --> 19:52.826
- Huh, isn't that a coincidence?

19:52.861 --> 19:54.498
- What could that be?

19:54.533 --> 19:55.796
- It's not here
naturally, of course,

19:55.831 --> 19:57.402
I have to stock the island.

19:57.437 --> 19:58.271
- Of course.

19:59.736 --> 20:02.407
- Please, sir, let
me introduce myself.

20:02.442 --> 20:03.936
I'm Baron Carl Von Wolf.

20:03.971 --> 20:05.003
- And I'm Marcus-

20:05.038 --> 20:06.906
- You need no introduction, sir.

20:06.941 --> 20:08.611
I have read all of your books.

20:08.646 --> 20:10.316
I know of your adventures.

20:10.351 --> 20:11.647
I too am a hunter.

20:11.682 --> 20:12.483
- Yes.

20:13.915 --> 20:15.618
- Where are my manners?

20:15.653 --> 20:17.653
Please, shall we sit,
drink wine, eat good food?

20:17.688 --> 20:20.590
You all deserve a bit of
conversation and relaxation.

20:20.625 --> 20:22.592
- Uh, I don't mind if I do.

20:22.627 --> 20:23.659
- After you.

20:23.694 --> 20:24.759
- Thank you, Baron.

20:32.604 --> 20:34.802
Baron, what is the animal

20:34.837 --> 20:36.870
that you have imported
here to your island?

20:36.905 --> 20:38.608
Lions, tigers?

20:40.381 --> 20:44.515
- I'm afraid tigers ceased to
interest me a long time ago.

20:44.550 --> 20:47.617
They would not survive in
this climate, I might add.

20:47.652 --> 20:49.751
However, I exhausted their
possibilities, you see.

20:49.786 --> 20:53.392
There was no real thrill
there, no real danger.

20:53.427 --> 20:55.922
And I'm afraid
danger is something

20:55.957 --> 20:57.528
that has been forged into me.

20:57.563 --> 20:59.057
Maybe because of my
military background.

21:00.533 --> 21:03.633
I am familiar with the
New Yorker, Rex Allen,

21:04.603 --> 21:06.064
if I'm not mistaken.

21:06.099 --> 21:07.769
- You are correct, sir.

21:09.476 --> 21:11.806
- You made your riches
in stocks, I believe.

21:13.513 --> 21:15.579
I've once read in
one of your stories

21:15.614 --> 21:19.044
about you taking down a mighty
elk with a muzzle loader,

21:19.079 --> 21:22.916
coincidentally in your own home
state, if I'm not mistaken.

21:22.951 --> 21:24.786
- You are correct, sir.

21:24.821 --> 21:25.688
- Impressive.

21:26.625 --> 21:27.459
You.

21:29.892 --> 21:32.431
I have no idea of your exploits.

21:33.863 --> 21:36.699
- I don't have any.

21:36.734 --> 21:38.602
- Nonsense.

21:38.637 --> 21:41.869
My son Sanger is a
decorated war hero.

21:41.904 --> 21:42.936
- Is that so?

21:42.971 --> 21:43.772
- Father.

21:45.446 --> 21:46.940
I'd rather not talk about it.

21:49.483 --> 21:51.450
- Never be afraid of the
things that you have done

21:51.485 --> 21:52.616
in this life, Sanger.

21:53.718 --> 21:54.783
They're what define us.

21:54.818 --> 21:56.719
That is something to embrace.

21:56.754 --> 21:57.555
- Well said.

22:03.992 --> 22:06.894
- I am most glad to
have your company here,

22:06.929 --> 22:08.467
although I am terribly sorry

22:08.502 --> 22:10.832
that it's under such
sad circumstances.

22:10.867 --> 22:13.439
- Yes, we lost a
very good friend.

22:14.200 --> 22:15.936
- The whole crew too.

22:15.971 --> 22:17.443
It's all a damn shame.

22:20.811 --> 22:22.877
- We still have three
people unaccounted for.

22:24.518 --> 22:26.551
And yeah, it's terrible.

22:28.049 --> 22:29.114
Life lost for no reason.

22:34.660 --> 22:36.055
- I have a ship.

22:36.090 --> 22:39.696
It is off island for
another several days,

22:39.731 --> 22:40.862
getting supplies, you see.

22:42.096 --> 22:44.899
When it returns, you
shall all voyage home.

22:45.902 --> 22:46.967
- Thank you, Baron.

22:47.002 --> 22:48.001
Very gracious.

22:49.741 --> 22:50.641
- That's good news.

22:52.007 --> 22:53.578
- Baron, you were speaking

22:53.613 --> 22:55.206
of the game here on
the island earlier.

22:55.241 --> 22:58.880
- Yes, well, we shall all
hunt while you are here, no?

22:58.915 --> 23:00.750
You will be amused, I think.

23:00.785 --> 23:02.686
I've done a rare thing.

23:02.721 --> 23:05.216
I have invented a new sensation.

23:05.251 --> 23:06.657
Ivan, more port.

23:09.695 --> 23:12.124
- You don't happen to have
any whiskey there, do you?

23:14.128 --> 23:17.195
Okay, all right,
just thought I'd ask.

23:17.230 --> 23:18.636
Take it easy, big fella.

23:21.872 --> 23:23.938
- Port makes some men
poets, Mr. Rainsford.

23:25.238 --> 23:29.042
Some it makes
kings, some beggers.

23:29.077 --> 23:30.208
He made us hunters, didn't he?

23:30.243 --> 23:31.110
- Yes, he did.

23:32.718 --> 23:36.555
- This hand was made for
the trigger, my father said.

23:36.590 --> 23:38.018
He was a very rich man.

23:38.053 --> 23:40.658
He owned a quarter of a
million acres in Poland.

23:42.530 --> 23:43.221
When I was five,

23:44.895 --> 23:47.060
he gave me a little gun
to shoot sparrows with.

23:48.329 --> 23:52.967
When I shot his prize turkeys
instead, he did not punish me.

23:53.002 --> 23:54.672
No.

23:54.707 --> 23:57.807
Instead he complimented
me on my marksmanship.

23:58.876 --> 24:01.547
My whole life has
been one prolonged hunt.

24:03.012 --> 24:05.012
I mean, I've been into the
army as what was expected

24:05.047 --> 24:06.882
from an nobleman's son.

24:06.917 --> 24:10.083
And for a time I commanded a
division of men that, well,

24:10.118 --> 24:13.218
later we be referred
to as the Wolf Pack.

24:13.253 --> 24:17.728
But my real interest
was always the hunt.

24:19.699 --> 24:22.931
- Baron, excuse me if
I'm off the mark here,

24:22.966 --> 24:27.001
but I'd wager a bet
you're from Germany?

24:28.268 --> 24:30.268
- I left the country
for it was imprudent

24:30.303 --> 24:32.072
for an officer of the
Reich to stay there,

24:32.107 --> 24:35.108
especially as myself
never cared much for war

24:35.143 --> 24:36.076
nor the man leading it.

24:39.081 --> 24:40.652
Many lost everything.

24:42.590 --> 24:47.593
Luckily, I had invested
heavily in American securities.

24:48.761 --> 24:50.860
So naturally, I
continued my hunt.

24:50.895 --> 24:54.831
Crocodiles in the Ganges,
rhinoceros in East Africa.

24:54.866 --> 24:57.933
And eventually I left
to hunt the famed jaguar

24:58.804 --> 25:00.298
in the infamous Amazon.

25:01.267 --> 25:03.169
It was a creature of
great disappointment.

25:03.204 --> 25:04.841
- What?

25:04.876 --> 25:07.140
The jaguar is the most
revered cat there is.

25:08.649 --> 25:09.714
- I assure you, sir,

25:10.950 --> 25:13.817
there is nothing interesting
about the hunt of the jaguar,

25:13.852 --> 25:15.753
a dumb animal, really.

25:15.788 --> 25:17.656
- I'm sorry about
Rex's outburst,

25:17.691 --> 25:21.825
but he has been desperate
to hunt the jaguar

25:21.860 --> 25:23.893
for probably 10 years now.

25:23.928 --> 25:26.192
- I will offer a
better alternative.

25:26.227 --> 25:27.259
I can assure you of that.

25:27.294 --> 25:29.129
- Oh yeah, right, of course,

25:29.164 --> 25:31.131
probably the secret beast you
have somewhere hidden here

25:31.166 --> 25:32.836
on your wretched island, right?

25:32.871 --> 25:34.299
- Rex.
- Sanger.

25:34.334 --> 25:36.609
You've been strangely quiet.

25:37.711 --> 25:39.073
- I'm just listening, Father.

25:41.308 --> 25:42.241
- Observation.

25:44.113 --> 25:46.619
A trait from the war, I gather.

25:46.654 --> 25:48.115
- A trait any man
should acquire.

25:51.021 --> 25:52.086
- If only they all did.

25:53.793 --> 25:55.793
What was your
speciality, Sanger?

25:55.828 --> 25:57.091
In the war, I mean.

25:57.126 --> 25:58.125
- I was a marksman.

25:59.194 --> 26:00.666
- Have you hunted much?

26:00.701 --> 26:02.063
- No.

26:02.098 --> 26:03.966
That's why I invited him
to join us on this trip.

26:04.001 --> 26:06.166
- The kid's a crack
shot from 500 yards.

26:06.201 --> 26:08.267
Beats me on my best day.

26:08.302 --> 26:09.103
- Thousand.

26:09.974 --> 26:10.775
- Huh?

26:10.810 --> 26:11.644
- Pardon?

26:12.380 --> 26:14.108
- Thousand yards
is my best shot.

26:25.385 --> 26:26.692
There we are.

27:02.092 --> 27:04.895
- There is no greater
bore than perfection,

27:04.930 --> 27:05.896
is there, Sanger?

27:09.198 --> 27:12.232
See, I became the
perfect hunter.

27:13.202 --> 27:14.300
No quarry could match me.

27:14.335 --> 27:17.875
No animal stood a chance.

27:20.748 --> 27:23.441
Boredom found me very easily.

27:26.479 --> 27:30.349
Then one day, it
just came to me.

27:31.858 --> 27:32.450
- What did?

27:35.356 --> 27:37.829
- I had to invent
something new to hunt.

27:39.932 --> 27:43.769
This island is a
perfect preserve.

27:45.234 --> 27:50.237
Trees, streams,
hills, mountains.

27:54.848 --> 27:59.015
I had to hunt something
that had courage, cunning,

28:00.414 --> 28:04.284
and above all else, it
had to be able to reason.

28:05.958 --> 28:07.859
- No animal can reason.

28:11.425 --> 28:12.259
- There is but one.

28:16.067 --> 28:17.066
- Not man.

28:17.904 --> 28:19.101
That's murderous.

28:21.171 --> 28:25.470
- I refuse to believe that
such modern and civilized men

28:27.408 --> 28:32.411
would have romantic ideals
about the value of human life.

28:35.955 --> 28:40.958
Especially one such as yourself
that tasted it, felt it.

28:44.392 --> 28:45.391
- War is war.

28:47.065 --> 28:48.328
It didn't make me a murderer.

28:50.134 --> 28:51.001
- No, boy.

28:52.466 --> 28:53.839
It made you a hunter.

28:55.502 --> 28:58.074
- This is some kind
of sick joke, right?

28:59.473 --> 29:01.814
- I do not joke about my hunts.

29:01.849 --> 29:05.279
- Baron, if what you
are saying is serious,

29:05.314 --> 29:08.084
then this is murder.

29:08.988 --> 29:10.086
- That word again.

29:15.324 --> 29:18.226
I would wager that you
will forget that notion

29:18.261 --> 29:19.997
once you go hunting with me.

29:20.032 --> 29:23.297
You will have a genuine
thrill in store for you.

29:23.332 --> 29:25.299
Correct me if I
am wrong, Sanger,

29:25.334 --> 29:29.303
but there is no hunting
like the hunting of man.

29:29.338 --> 29:31.844
Those who have hunted
armed men for long enough

29:31.879 --> 29:35.441
and liked it never cared for
anything else thereafter.

29:37.247 --> 29:39.379
- I've never found pleasure
in taking any life.

29:41.449 --> 29:44.087
Never mind another person's.

29:44.122 --> 29:46.320
- This is barbarism.

29:47.422 --> 29:49.290
- It's all a joke.

29:50.590 --> 29:52.997
The old Baron here is
just trying to scare us

29:53.032 --> 29:55.967
with some of his
German fear tactics.

29:56.970 --> 30:00.400
- Your American humor is
beginning to unnerve me.

30:03.372 --> 30:08.342
Life is for the strong,
to be lived by the strong.

30:09.983 --> 30:12.984
And it may be taken
by the strong.

30:14.680 --> 30:16.218
The weak of the
fold were put here

30:16.253 --> 30:17.351
for the strong's pleasure.

30:17.386 --> 30:18.924
And I am strong.

30:20.290 --> 30:23.027
I survived the war, even
though my people lost.

30:27.396 --> 30:30.100
Why should I not be
able to use my gift?

30:30.135 --> 30:32.938
If I wish to hunt,

30:32.973 --> 30:36.172
why should I not be able
to continue to do so?

30:36.207 --> 30:37.239
- Because they're human.

30:37.274 --> 30:38.537
- Precisely.

30:41.542 --> 30:43.311
Men can reason.

30:47.482 --> 30:50.318
That makes them a
worthy adversary.

30:50.353 --> 30:51.957
That makes them dangerous.

30:53.455 --> 30:54.388
- A worthy adversary?

30:57.063 --> 31:00.361
Tell me, Baron, were
they worthy adversaries

31:00.396 --> 31:02.429
when you locked us
up in the camps?

31:02.464 --> 31:04.530
- I was against that.

31:04.565 --> 31:06.466
The camps were a waste of time.

31:06.501 --> 31:10.107
They cost too much money and
were a waste of resources.

31:10.142 --> 31:14.606
- Where do these
lost souls come from?

31:14.641 --> 31:16.575
- How did you get
here, Mr. Rainsford?

31:19.085 --> 31:21.151
It's a small channel.

31:21.186 --> 31:25.551
It is just small enough,
yet just deep enough

31:25.586 --> 31:28.455
that sea mines prove
an effective tool

31:28.490 --> 31:30.160
against unsuspecting ships.

31:30.195 --> 31:31.524
- You blew us up.

31:31.559 --> 31:33.999
- I created the event
that got you here, yeah,

31:34.034 --> 31:37.563
but I had no way of knowing
who's on board the vessel.

31:37.598 --> 31:39.631
It is by sheer coincidence
that you are here

31:39.666 --> 31:42.106
and much to my delight.

31:42.141 --> 31:45.472
So we go hunting tomorrow, yes?

31:45.507 --> 31:46.539
- No.

31:46.574 --> 31:48.211
- Hell no.

31:48.246 --> 31:50.708
- We are not going to
participate whatsoever

31:50.743 --> 31:52.083
in your murder hunt.

31:54.252 --> 31:55.284
- Hypocrites!

32:10.631 --> 32:12.367
A fresh kill from this morning.

32:13.733 --> 32:15.172
Took three shots.

32:16.571 --> 32:18.109
The first two wounded him,

32:19.508 --> 32:21.739
the third made him close
his eyes for the final time.

32:24.282 --> 32:26.645
He will make an adequate
addition to my collection.

32:28.616 --> 32:29.483
- Your collection?

32:34.622 --> 32:35.654
- Jesus Christ.

32:42.366 --> 32:43.497
- There's a game, you see.

32:45.237 --> 32:50.207
I give them supplies, food,
an excellent hunting knife.

32:51.375 --> 32:53.507
They get three
hours of start time.

32:54.376 --> 32:57.346
I follow, armed
only with my rifle.

32:59.251 --> 33:02.648
If my quarry eludes me
for three whole days,

33:02.683 --> 33:03.517
they win the game.

33:05.422 --> 33:08.489
If I find them, he loses.

33:09.358 --> 33:12.163
- Okay, and suppose
they refuse to hunt?

33:13.562 --> 33:16.299
- Ivan's torturous methods
are quite unbearable.

33:17.566 --> 33:20.237
It is his own idea of sport.

33:21.636 --> 33:24.802
Those who have refused
have never survived longer

33:24.837 --> 33:27.805
than a night in his care.

33:28.707 --> 33:31.512
And although to date,
I have not lost,

33:32.548 --> 33:36.088
and only on one occasion did
my quarry choose an ending

33:36.123 --> 33:38.321
of the suicidal variety.

33:38.356 --> 33:39.652
The coward, shamefully.

33:39.687 --> 33:43.392
He seemed like a
worthy opponent.

33:44.659 --> 33:47.528
- Yes, well, Baron, I'm sorry,

33:47.563 --> 33:50.696
but we are not going to
participate in your murder hunt.

34:06.879 --> 34:08.252
- Be quick.

34:08.287 --> 34:09.385
- Father.
- Please go.

34:09.420 --> 34:10.716
- Father.
- Be quiet.

34:11.818 --> 34:13.587
You are a Rainsford.

34:23.665 --> 34:25.269
- Apologies, my boy.

34:26.503 --> 34:27.601
But they refused.

34:28.637 --> 34:30.538
I suppose you will not.

34:33.642 --> 34:34.608
Three days, Sanger.

34:38.251 --> 34:42.616
Although, I guess you are
now the Mr. Rainsford?

34:44.323 --> 34:45.157
Ah.

34:48.789 --> 34:49.623
Ah.

34:50.593 --> 34:52.164
This is good.

34:52.199 --> 34:53.627
Fire in your eyes.

34:55.202 --> 34:55.827
Ah.

34:57.468 --> 35:00.799
I'm excited to see what kind
of adversary you will be.

35:04.706 --> 35:05.540
Here.

35:07.742 --> 35:08.576
Put these on.

35:32.338 --> 35:35.240
Here we all are now, Sanger.

35:35.275 --> 35:37.869
I would like to introduce you
to Miss Mary, Mr. Quinlan.

35:39.411 --> 35:41.378
They have been here
for a few weeks now.

35:41.413 --> 35:44.546
I've been waiting for the most
opportune moment to use them.

35:45.648 --> 35:47.714
I think now, paired with you,

35:47.749 --> 35:50.684
will make the game
much more interesting.

35:53.623 --> 35:54.721
Do you have your supplies?

35:56.296 --> 35:58.329
Some fresh water, food,

35:58.364 --> 36:02.201
enough of such to last for
three days if rationed properly.

36:05.569 --> 36:07.206
I will give you three hours.

36:08.175 --> 36:10.671
Plenty enough time for
a good solid head start.

36:12.774 --> 36:15.742
You engaged in
the war years ago.

36:15.777 --> 36:17.513
That was not yours
to interrupt in.

36:18.846 --> 36:23.585
Today, we continue the
battle, Mr. Rainsford.

36:25.853 --> 36:26.720
Ah.

36:28.328 --> 36:28.953
Let us play.

36:31.958 --> 36:32.792
Run.

36:38.932 --> 36:41.735
I will see you
soon, Mr. Rainsford.

36:45.411 --> 36:46.773
Let the hunt begin.

37:38.860 --> 37:40.695
- Come on, come on.

37:40.730 --> 37:41.993
Let's go.

37:42.028 --> 37:44.336
No, no, Mary, Mary,
we can't stop.

37:44.371 --> 37:46.063
We have to keep moving.

37:46.098 --> 37:47.933
Come on.
- Where are we gonna go?

37:47.968 --> 37:48.967
We don't even have a plan.

37:51.378 --> 37:54.742
- The plan is just to
keep moving, all right?

37:54.777 --> 37:55.809
We have to go, come on.

37:56.779 --> 37:58.042
Whoa, whoa.

37:58.077 --> 38:02.013
Look.

38:02.048 --> 38:04.389
- I'm afraid we
didn't have a chance

38:04.424 --> 38:06.787
to properly introduce
ourselves back there.

38:09.660 --> 38:13.057
- Yeah, well, I don't
think it matters right now.

38:14.863 --> 38:15.829
- It matters.

38:16.665 --> 38:18.799
Look, if we're gonna
survive together,

38:18.834 --> 38:20.933
it's not gonna hurt to
know each other's names.

38:21.902 --> 38:24.871
And I'm sorry, I didn't
catch yours back there

38:24.906 --> 38:26.510
in the middle of that chaos.

38:26.545 --> 38:29.843
I was a bit distracted.

38:32.551 --> 38:33.682
- My name is Mary.

38:40.658 --> 38:41.492
- Quin.

38:42.528 --> 38:43.527
- My name is Sanger.

38:44.926 --> 38:47.091
- Sanger, how did you
come about the island?

38:48.567 --> 38:50.864
- I can only assume
the same as you two,

38:50.899 --> 38:54.131
traveling on a ship that
had no business sailing

38:54.166 --> 38:55.572
into these waters.

39:00.480 --> 39:02.612
What can you tell
me about the Baron?

39:02.647 --> 39:04.515
- He's a very evil man.

39:06.211 --> 39:07.012
- Calculated.

39:09.951 --> 39:11.654
- He leaves with people like us

39:11.689 --> 39:14.184
and he always comes back alone.

39:14.219 --> 39:16.461
- And usually with a
bloody canvas sack.

39:19.158 --> 39:22.434
- For his trophies and
his wall nonetheless.

39:23.833 --> 39:24.667
- His wall?

39:26.704 --> 39:27.934
- Yeah.

39:27.969 --> 39:29.936
Never mind, it's not important.

39:31.841 --> 39:33.874
- So how did you come
about these waters?

39:34.843 --> 39:37.812
- Me and my father, we
were on a hunting trip.

39:38.815 --> 39:41.948
We were going to a place
called Kodiak to hunt bear.

39:43.215 --> 39:44.049
And...

39:46.889 --> 39:49.989
Yes, I'm familiar
with hunting tactics

39:50.024 --> 39:51.628
and how to track prey.

39:52.697 --> 39:54.092
- So what do you suggest we do?

39:57.966 --> 40:02.903
- Well, I'd say we
follow this water.

40:03.972 --> 40:06.742
I can't tell you exactly the
type of hunter the Baron is.

40:08.273 --> 40:11.615
I mean, he talks as if he's
the most experienced hunter

40:11.650 --> 40:15.212
and I can only assume
he is quite the tracker,

40:15.247 --> 40:17.016
given his experience in the war.

40:18.624 --> 40:20.085
You know, if we stay
inside this water,

40:20.120 --> 40:22.494
it'll mask our
scent and our trail.

40:26.159 --> 40:28.995
- So do you think we'll survive?

40:29.030 --> 40:31.965
- I think we have
a fighting chance.

40:33.870 --> 40:35.870
And that's something I
know a little bit about.

40:38.842 --> 40:40.578
How do you two know each other?

40:40.613 --> 40:41.876
- Quinlan is my brother.

40:42.846 --> 40:43.581
- I see.

40:44.881 --> 40:46.947
- We were heading north
to see our father.

40:48.951 --> 40:49.851
- He's very sick.

40:51.250 --> 40:53.954
And unfortunately he
doesn't have much time.

40:56.255 --> 41:00.059
- He's been working the fishing
docks down by the territory.

41:00.094 --> 41:02.534
We chartered a
vessel to get here.

41:02.569 --> 41:03.667
- And let me guess.

41:04.903 --> 41:06.967
Cutting through the channel
near the island would've saved

41:07.002 --> 41:09.101
a few extra days.

41:09.136 --> 41:11.037
- Yes, exactly.

41:11.072 --> 41:12.104
- All right then.

41:12.139 --> 41:15.140
What do you say we keep moving?

41:15.175 --> 41:17.010
Let's not let this
guy catch up to us.

41:17.045 --> 41:18.649
Yeah?

41:18.684 --> 41:19.518
- Okay.

41:52.311 --> 41:53.981
- This looks like a good spot.

41:55.886 --> 41:57.314
Let's rest up here
in this brush.

41:59.120 --> 42:03.221
- Well, we're sleeping
in those bushes?

42:03.256 --> 42:04.794
- Yeah.

42:04.829 --> 42:07.698
Look, we've been
walking a good while.

42:08.800 --> 42:10.228
Our scent shouldn't
be traceable.

42:10.263 --> 42:12.571
We've done a decent
job with our tracks.

42:14.168 --> 42:16.069
I say we rest up here
for a little while.

42:16.104 --> 42:19.743
Come nightfall, we'll
get back on the trail.

42:21.142 --> 42:22.944
- Where did you learn
about this sort of thing?

42:24.849 --> 42:26.079
- My father.

42:27.181 --> 42:28.081
- Where's he?

42:31.086 --> 42:32.052
- Baron shot him.

42:34.122 --> 42:35.726
- I'm sorry.

42:35.761 --> 42:36.661
- Yeah, me too.

42:37.323 --> 42:38.157
- He shot him?

42:39.226 --> 42:40.093
Where?

42:41.668 --> 42:46.671
- We were at dinner
before I met you two,

42:48.675 --> 42:51.302
and my father refused
to hunt with him.

42:53.273 --> 42:54.140
- That's not like him.

42:55.143 --> 42:56.879
- What do you mean?

42:59.048 --> 43:00.718
- He doesn't shoot anyone

43:00.753 --> 43:03.622
unless he takes him out
here into the forest.

43:05.758 --> 43:07.120
So why did he keep you alive?

43:10.191 --> 43:11.025
- I'm not sure.

43:13.260 --> 43:16.228
- Yeah, well, it probably
would've been better

43:16.263 --> 43:17.130
to die over there.

43:18.333 --> 43:21.398
- Being shot there doesn't give
you a chance to fight back.

43:23.072 --> 43:24.973
- And you know
something about that?

43:25.008 --> 43:25.842
- I do.

43:27.274 --> 43:30.913
- What, are you a
soldier or something?

43:30.948 --> 43:31.782
- I was.

43:33.049 --> 43:33.949
Look, enough of that.

43:33.984 --> 43:34.983
Let's get some rest.

43:36.283 --> 43:37.887
For both of you.

43:37.922 --> 43:39.284
If we're gonna survive
the next three days,

43:39.319 --> 43:41.154
we're gonna need all
the rest we can get.

43:42.157 --> 43:42.991
Let's go.

43:44.324 --> 43:46.192
Enough talking.

45:18.319 --> 45:19.318
Nobody move.

45:40.605 --> 45:43.078
Quinlan, control yourself.

45:46.281 --> 45:47.346
- He's gone.

45:47.381 --> 45:48.952
He's gone.

45:48.987 --> 45:50.085
We have to go, we
have to go right now.

45:50.120 --> 45:50.954
- No.

45:53.288 --> 45:54.287
- Do not move.

45:55.994 --> 45:57.059
- We must run.

45:57.094 --> 45:58.258
Let's go.

45:58.293 --> 45:59.391
- Stop.

45:59.426 --> 46:00.931
Quinlan, stop.

46:00.966 --> 46:02.097
- We must run.

46:04.035 --> 46:04.869
- Damn it.

46:06.004 --> 46:07.432
- Come on, we gotta go, guys.

46:07.467 --> 46:08.972
Come on, come on.

46:55.416 --> 46:56.415
- Run, run!

47:19.539 --> 47:21.209
- Let's go.

47:25.578 --> 47:30.383
- The game is much more fun
when you run, Mr. Rainsford!

47:40.725 --> 47:42.461
Go.

47:42.496 --> 47:43.902
Tend your wounds.

47:44.630 --> 47:46.168
They will leave a trail

47:46.203 --> 47:47.466
that Rainsford might
be able to follow.

47:47.501 --> 47:49.468
And we certainly
do not need that.

47:49.503 --> 47:50.337
Go.

47:55.245 --> 47:56.640
Bullet went into your lung, boy.

47:59.986 --> 48:01.645
That's why you are
short of breath.

48:01.680 --> 48:03.152
Beginning to suffocate.

48:05.057 --> 48:07.387
Soon, you will drown
in your own blood.

48:07.422 --> 48:08.960
Horrible way to die, I say.

48:10.392 --> 48:13.426
You proved nothing of a
worthy adversary, I'm afraid.

48:14.462 --> 48:15.428
I'm bored.

48:18.730 --> 48:20.433
- Please.

48:21.535 --> 48:23.040
- You aren't worth the bullet.

48:46.329 --> 48:51.035
But the faint hope of
mercy is worth the report.

48:51.070 --> 48:51.695
- Got it.

48:56.537 --> 48:58.273
- He didn't suffer.

48:58.308 --> 48:59.142
- What?

49:00.409 --> 49:02.145
- That was a kill shot.

49:03.313 --> 49:05.082
A shot meant to show
mercy on an animal

49:05.117 --> 49:07.612
if the previous shot from a
distance wasn't entirely fatal.

49:09.418 --> 49:10.681
- Mercy?

49:10.716 --> 49:13.222
That man has no mercy.

49:13.257 --> 49:15.026
- We don't have time for
this right now, okay?

49:15.061 --> 49:16.522
The only thing your brother
would want is for you to survive

49:16.557 --> 49:19.030
and in order to do that,
we have to keep moving.

49:19.065 --> 49:20.691
We can grieve him later.

49:20.726 --> 49:23.661
Right now, we need to create
distance between him and us.

49:24.763 --> 49:26.334
- Distance?

49:26.369 --> 49:27.203
Why?

49:29.075 --> 49:30.668
- Because I need
time to set a trap.

49:51.196 --> 49:52.525
This looks like a good spot.

49:59.534 --> 50:00.368
Yeah.

50:07.410 --> 50:08.805
Right here is good.

50:08.840 --> 50:09.674
Let's rest up.

50:35.669 --> 50:36.569
Hey.

50:38.573 --> 50:39.605
Can I ask you a question?

50:42.874 --> 50:47.811
After seeing your father,
would you have gone back

50:49.254 --> 50:52.585
to wherever it is
that you came from?

50:55.359 --> 50:56.160
- No.

50:56.888 --> 50:57.821
- Why not?

51:03.565 --> 51:05.598
- I'm from a small
town in Colorado

51:06.534 --> 51:09.701
and it's lovely there,
but there's no future.

51:12.409 --> 51:13.672
So my brother and I,

51:16.413 --> 51:19.645
we were gonna go
to the east coast

51:19.680 --> 51:21.680
to start a business together.

51:21.715 --> 51:22.747
- Entrepreneur.

51:24.454 --> 51:25.288
Okay.

51:27.754 --> 51:28.654
What kind of business?

51:32.792 --> 51:33.626
- I make chocolate.

51:35.399 --> 51:37.531
Seems ridiculous now, but...

51:37.566 --> 51:38.796
- Who doesn't like chocolate?

51:40.338 --> 51:43.174
I'd kill somebody right
now for some chocolate.

51:47.213 --> 51:48.509
- What about you?

51:48.544 --> 51:49.840
Have you ever been
to the east coast?

51:51.580 --> 51:53.646
- Yeah, yeah.

51:53.681 --> 51:54.647
I live there.

51:55.650 --> 51:56.451
New York.

51:58.554 --> 51:59.355
- Wow.

52:01.392 --> 52:04.195
I've never seen a big
city like New York before.

52:06.496 --> 52:07.660
What's that like?

52:13.470 --> 52:14.304
- Lots of people

52:15.802 --> 52:16.801
who love chocolate.

52:20.444 --> 52:22.939
And tall buildings
take all the sky,

52:24.646 --> 52:29.649
automobiles rumble and grumble
night and day, and rats.

52:34.920 --> 52:36.194
Lots of fucking rats.

52:41.432 --> 52:43.696
- I would really like
to see New York someday.

52:44.798 --> 52:46.369
- I'll tell you what.

52:46.404 --> 52:47.733
We get out of this,
I promise you will.

52:47.768 --> 52:49.339
I'll take you there myself.

52:50.705 --> 52:52.342
- That's kind of you,

52:52.377 --> 52:53.739
but we're in no place
to make any promises.

52:56.282 --> 52:56.940
- I'm a Rainsford.

52:58.779 --> 53:00.977
I know where I'm going, ma'am.

53:02.981 --> 53:04.585
- Honor.

53:04.620 --> 53:05.454
That's admirable.

53:07.953 --> 53:08.787
- Now.

53:12.925 --> 53:15.728
If I can find a
particular tree...

54:31.069 --> 54:32.739
- Did I do okay?

54:32.774 --> 54:35.346
- You did perfect.
- You think we got him?

54:43.686 --> 54:44.685
- Rainsford!

54:49.054 --> 54:49.888
Rainsford!

54:51.793 --> 54:52.627
Rainsford!

54:53.861 --> 54:54.794
Did I hit you?

54:55.995 --> 55:00.965
Oh, if so, it must
barely be an abrasion!

55:03.937 --> 55:06.839
If you can still hear
the sound of my voice,

55:08.513 --> 55:12.383
which I suppose you can, I
want to congratulate you!

55:13.815 --> 55:16.684
Not many men know how to
make a Malay mancatcher.

55:25.662 --> 55:28.960
A trap learned from
your father, I gather.

55:32.504 --> 55:36.836
Lucky for me, I
hunted in Morocco too.

55:42.041 --> 55:42.875
Rainsford.

55:43.713 --> 55:44.547
Rainsford!

55:46.518 --> 55:51.521
You have proved a very worthy
and very fun adversary,

55:52.491 --> 55:53.820
Mr. Rainsford.

56:03.029 --> 56:05.898
I'm going to go get
my wound dressed.

56:05.933 --> 56:07.768
It's only a slight one,

56:08.969 --> 56:11.706
but it may keep me
from aiming straight.

56:15.646 --> 56:16.909
But I will be back, sir.

56:25.557 --> 56:26.820
I will be back.

56:31.156 --> 56:31.990
Rainsford!

56:34.632 --> 56:36.599
Rainsford!

56:43.707 --> 56:45.069
I'll be coming back.

56:51.583 --> 56:52.208
Rainsford!

56:53.552 --> 56:55.948
Rainsford, I'm coming for you!

57:17.235 --> 57:18.740
- We have to bandage that.

57:21.206 --> 57:22.040
- Yeah, we do.

57:30.853 --> 57:31.984
- He left behind a trail?

57:33.251 --> 57:34.085
- Yeah.

57:38.058 --> 57:41.026
- Oh, I'm sorry I can't do more.

57:41.061 --> 57:41.895
- Hey.

57:43.162 --> 57:44.766
You have no reason to apologize.

57:46.066 --> 57:47.934
This isn't your fault.

57:47.969 --> 57:50.673
Why would you ever think you'd
be in a situation like this?

57:53.172 --> 57:55.040
- I've been thinking
about the large man.

57:56.780 --> 57:59.550
- The one he calls Ivan.
- Yes, Ivan.

57:59.585 --> 58:02.245
Back home, men used dogs
to chase the game birds

58:02.280 --> 58:04.115
and the mountain
cats from the woods.

58:05.756 --> 58:09.560
Do you suppose the Baron
uses the mute like a dog?

58:14.127 --> 58:15.027
- Yes.

58:16.162 --> 58:17.865
That's an accurate observation.

58:19.297 --> 58:21.704
Don't know how I
didn't see that.

58:21.739 --> 58:23.101
But you did.

58:23.136 --> 58:24.102
Well done, Mary.

58:26.205 --> 58:27.743
Hold on.

58:27.778 --> 58:29.173
- The Baron says he has a boat.

58:29.208 --> 58:30.680
I suggest we go find it.

58:32.046 --> 58:33.650
- The Baron's a liar.

58:33.685 --> 58:35.718
We don't know how many
men he actually has,

58:36.380 --> 58:37.786
where the ship would be,

58:39.988 --> 58:41.592
or if it even exists.

58:43.189 --> 58:47.224
- I overheard him talking
about bringing back supplies.

58:47.259 --> 58:48.632
- As did I.

58:48.667 --> 58:49.963
- So then it must be true.

58:53.969 --> 58:54.803
- Yeah.

58:56.972 --> 58:57.806
I suppose so.

58:59.403 --> 59:00.237
- Hey!

59:02.175 --> 59:03.273
Go back the other way.

59:04.243 --> 59:05.781
- The other way?
- Go!

59:08.016 --> 59:09.246
- We're not going back there.

59:10.381 --> 59:11.589
We're dead if we do.

59:15.188 --> 59:16.022
Who are you?

59:18.290 --> 59:21.126
- I am someone who tricked him.

59:21.161 --> 59:22.930
That's who I am.

59:22.965 --> 59:26.802
And nobody, but nobody will
compromise my hiding spot here.

59:26.837 --> 59:27.671
You understand?

59:28.839 --> 59:30.102
- Your ship sank here too.

59:31.677 --> 59:32.302
- Sank?

59:33.712 --> 59:35.140
Sank?

59:35.175 --> 59:37.241
Sank, what are you
talking about, sank?

59:37.276 --> 59:39.144
It was booby trapped.

59:39.179 --> 59:41.718
My men were hunted down
like pigs to the slaughter.

59:43.854 --> 59:46.250
But I, I survived.

59:46.285 --> 59:47.119
I fooled him.

59:49.354 --> 59:51.288
Now you two, go on, go.

59:53.996 --> 59:55.831
- Wait, please.

59:55.866 --> 59:56.997
We need your help.

1:00:01.267 --> 1:00:02.167
- I can't help you.

1:00:05.139 --> 1:00:05.973
- Yes, you can.

1:00:07.174 --> 1:00:08.943
You don't have any supplies,

1:00:08.978 --> 1:00:12.144
anything to clean and dress
this wound before it's infected?

1:00:12.179 --> 1:00:14.784
Anything, please.

1:00:19.285 --> 1:00:20.086
- Bugs.

1:00:20.988 --> 1:00:23.155
Bugs and dirt are
gonna get on that soon.

1:00:24.356 --> 1:00:25.795
Oh, this God forsaken place.

1:00:25.830 --> 1:00:27.159
Jesus Christ!

1:00:28.262 --> 1:00:31.097
If the Baron don't get you,
then the infection does.

1:00:36.808 --> 1:00:37.774
I had a...

1:00:39.140 --> 1:00:39.941
A daughter.

1:00:43.243 --> 1:00:45.210
I had a daughter, she...

1:00:45.245 --> 1:00:46.717
I have a daughter.

1:00:48.380 --> 1:00:50.083
She'd be about your age now.

1:00:55.761 --> 1:00:56.353
Come on.

1:01:52.851 --> 1:01:54.279
Yeah, it's pretty safe up here

1:01:54.314 --> 1:01:56.314
because the Baron
doesn't come around much.

1:01:57.856 --> 1:01:59.350
Those that he's hunting,

1:01:59.385 --> 1:02:00.956
he usually catches on
the first or second days.

1:02:01.860 --> 1:02:03.420
Most of those idiots, anyway,

1:02:03.455 --> 1:02:06.027
go rushing to the beaches
like a bunch of tourists.

1:02:07.063 --> 1:02:09.800
But unlike me,

1:02:09.835 --> 1:02:12.429
they didn't venture into
the interior of the island.

1:02:12.464 --> 1:02:14.167
But as you can see from here,

1:02:15.874 --> 1:02:18.501
I can see anyone coming
from a long distance.

1:02:21.880 --> 1:02:22.505
Now.

1:02:24.377 --> 1:02:25.783
Come on.

1:02:43.627 --> 1:02:44.461
See?

1:02:45.431 --> 1:02:46.837
I can see everything.

1:02:49.303 --> 1:02:51.237
Over there is where
they wash ashore

1:02:51.272 --> 1:02:55.879
after the Baron's seed mines
blow them to smithereens.

1:02:57.509 --> 1:02:59.916
And the Baron's hunting
lodge is over there.

1:03:01.513 --> 1:03:04.019
And up there over on the
other side is the valley

1:03:04.054 --> 1:03:05.317
where they all try to escape.

1:03:09.059 --> 1:03:10.322
- What was this place?

1:03:12.392 --> 1:03:14.161
- Well, as far as I can reckon,

1:03:14.196 --> 1:03:17.560
I think someone
lived here years ago

1:03:17.595 --> 1:03:19.331
with cattle of some sort,

1:03:19.366 --> 1:03:23.973
but it's a pretty sturdy
little structure actually.

1:03:24.976 --> 1:03:26.602
- Where did all this come from?

1:03:26.637 --> 1:03:31.145
- Oh, it washed ashore from
the boats that got blown up

1:03:32.348 --> 1:03:37.085
and, you know, then the tides
would just kind of move it

1:03:38.054 --> 1:03:41.925
around the island and
then I'd scavenge for it

1:03:41.960 --> 1:03:44.961
when he wasn't
out there hunting.

1:03:47.328 --> 1:03:49.933
- Earlier, you said
that you tricked him.

1:03:52.333 --> 1:03:53.497
- Yeah, I did.

1:03:55.336 --> 1:03:59.404
He hunted for me for three days,

1:04:00.979 --> 1:04:04.013
which under his rules
would've made me the victor,

1:04:04.048 --> 1:04:08.215
but the Wolf is not
an honorable man.

1:04:08.250 --> 1:04:12.054
And he doesn't like being
bested at his own game.

1:04:12.089 --> 1:04:14.452
- So he had zero intention
to let you on that ship.

1:04:16.060 --> 1:04:17.224
Assuming there is one.

1:04:18.128 --> 1:04:19.963
- Oh, there is a ship.

1:04:19.998 --> 1:04:24.363
It's anchored in the bay right
next to his hunting lodge.

1:04:24.970 --> 1:04:26.563
But no, no,

1:04:26.598 --> 1:04:28.532
there was no way he was gonna
let me get on that ship.

1:04:30.569 --> 1:04:32.569
At the end of the third day,

1:04:32.604 --> 1:04:37.013
he had me cornered
on top of this bluff,

1:04:37.048 --> 1:04:38.410
overlooking the ocean.

1:04:39.512 --> 1:04:40.412
And I...

1:04:43.615 --> 1:04:44.614
I jumped.

1:04:47.091 --> 1:04:49.388
Guess he thought I
committed suicide.

1:04:50.622 --> 1:04:53.194
He must have really
been disappointed.

1:04:56.100 --> 1:04:58.100
- Why have you not
gone to get the ship?

1:05:01.204 --> 1:05:06.141
- Well, I didn't really want
to give up my position here.

1:05:07.573 --> 1:05:09.573
And besides, I mean, it
takes more than one person

1:05:09.608 --> 1:05:12.114
to run a ship that size, right?

1:05:12.149 --> 1:05:14.578
And then, oh, then
there's the mute.

1:05:16.219 --> 1:05:17.185
- Ivan.

1:05:17.220 --> 1:05:18.615
- Yeah, the big Ruskie.

1:05:18.650 --> 1:05:20.584
He's insane.

1:05:20.619 --> 1:05:22.289
Insane, I'm telling you.

1:05:25.558 --> 1:05:27.459
And he's strong as
a bull, I might add.

1:05:28.395 --> 1:05:30.495
- You have
grenades and bullets.

1:05:30.530 --> 1:05:33.696
- Yeah, nothing to shoot
the bullets with though.

1:05:33.731 --> 1:05:36.039
The grenades, I don't know.

1:05:36.074 --> 1:05:39.636
I just haven't really
figured an opportune time to,

1:05:39.671 --> 1:05:40.978
or way to use them.

1:05:42.443 --> 1:05:43.475
- Trip wire.

1:05:45.050 --> 1:05:45.675
- Pardon me?

1:05:47.811 --> 1:05:50.020
- You can make trip
wires from grenades.

1:05:52.090 --> 1:05:53.518
Simple trap.

1:05:53.553 --> 1:05:55.355
- Yeah.

1:05:55.390 --> 1:05:56.488
That ain't a bad idea.

1:05:58.228 --> 1:06:00.492
What are you, some kind
of soldier or something?

1:06:01.429 --> 1:06:02.263
- I was.

1:06:04.399 --> 1:06:05.233
- Oh.

1:06:06.731 --> 1:06:09.732
Well, let's take a look at this.

1:06:09.767 --> 1:06:11.701
See what we can do.

1:06:11.736 --> 1:06:13.175
- What's your name, sir?

1:06:14.442 --> 1:06:19.445
- Oh, Benjamin Colt,
but you can call me Ben.

1:06:20.580 --> 1:06:21.513
Yeah.

1:06:23.121 --> 1:06:25.055
- And what do you do
for a living, Ben?

1:06:25.750 --> 1:06:27.387
- Well, would you believe it?

1:06:28.654 --> 1:06:30.654
I'm a doctor.

1:06:30.689 --> 1:06:32.524
Dr. Ben Colt.

1:06:33.758 --> 1:06:36.660
Hello.

1:06:48.179 --> 1:06:50.773
So where were you
actually headed to?

1:06:52.612 --> 1:06:54.282
- Really doesn't
matter much now.

1:06:56.715 --> 1:06:58.550
- No, I
suppose it doesn't.

1:07:00.158 --> 1:07:01.817
- How are we gonna
get off this island?

1:07:03.425 --> 1:07:08.098
- Well, I've never seen
two other survivors before,

1:07:10.267 --> 1:07:12.102
and least of all a soldier,

1:07:12.137 --> 1:07:16.436
but now that there's
three of us together,

1:07:17.637 --> 1:07:19.703
I think there's a
pretty good chance

1:07:19.738 --> 1:07:23.608
that we can take that boat.

1:07:23.643 --> 1:07:25.214
What do you think, soldier boy?

1:07:28.846 --> 1:07:30.582
- I say, at first
light, we move.

1:07:32.718 --> 1:07:34.817
Take this rag, mix
it with some water,

1:07:36.260 --> 1:07:38.689
make a trail to
divert the Baron,

1:07:38.724 --> 1:07:42.495
and then double back and
meet and bolt on the ship.

1:07:43.795 --> 1:07:47.368
- Remember, he's a sly
and cunning bastard.

1:07:48.668 --> 1:07:49.502
- I can do it.

1:07:51.638 --> 1:07:52.670
- Okay then.

1:07:52.705 --> 1:07:53.737
We have a plan.

1:07:59.679 --> 1:08:02.845
- But I am gonna need those
grenades, if you don't mind.

1:08:02.880 --> 1:08:04.583
- What for?

1:08:05.619 --> 1:08:06.882
- I just wanna leave our
host a little parting gift

1:08:06.917 --> 1:08:07.883
before we leave.

1:08:09.656 --> 1:08:10.622
For the both of us.

1:08:14.727 --> 1:08:18.663
- You know, I would reckon
to venture that you...

1:08:18.698 --> 1:08:23.635
You two have both lost
loved ones close to you, hm?

1:08:26.673 --> 1:08:30.312
Kind of a union
of rage and grief.

1:08:31.181 --> 1:08:33.777
Rather poetic metaphor,
don't you think?

1:08:33.812 --> 1:08:36.417
- There's nothing
poetic about it.

1:08:36.452 --> 1:08:39.750
He took our loved ones
and killed them for sport.

1:08:39.785 --> 1:08:41.257
He's a monster.

1:08:43.294 --> 1:08:44.656
- Yeah.

1:08:44.691 --> 1:08:48.561
Well, love, men are
like that sometimes.

1:08:48.596 --> 1:08:53.599
And occasionally we have to
just bear our fangs and claws

1:08:55.273 --> 1:08:56.635
or otherwise we're no better

1:08:56.670 --> 1:08:58.373
than the bugs beneath
our feet, are we?

1:09:00.740 --> 1:09:02.674
- Only the strong
were made to survive.

1:09:02.709 --> 1:09:04.709
- Got that right, soldier boy.

1:09:04.744 --> 1:09:05.974
You're all good,
you're good now.

1:09:06.009 --> 1:09:07.778
Hold on.

1:09:07.813 --> 1:09:08.911
Let me put this on here.

1:09:10.585 --> 1:09:11.749
- Thanks, doc.

1:09:11.784 --> 1:09:12.684
- Mm-hm.

1:09:17.592 --> 1:09:18.426
Okay.

1:09:19.858 --> 1:09:20.692
There you go.

1:09:45.785 --> 1:09:46.619
Good night.

1:10:02.736 --> 1:10:03.966
- Do you think we'll make it?

1:10:08.445 --> 1:10:09.609
- I made you a promise.

1:10:12.878 --> 1:10:14.581
- Yes, and as I said,

1:10:14.616 --> 1:10:16.880
we are not in a situation
to make any promises.

1:10:21.854 --> 1:10:24.393
- Look, I'm gonna
get you on that ship

1:10:25.462 --> 1:10:26.923
and you're gonna
see your father.

1:10:29.928 --> 1:10:31.466
- If he's even still alive.

1:10:38.376 --> 1:10:42.642
- Wish I was afforded the
doubt you take for granted.

1:10:47.913 --> 1:10:52.784
The chance to talk
to him one more time.

1:10:59.397 --> 1:11:00.363
- I'm sorry.

1:11:02.631 --> 1:11:04.532
- You know the worst
part about death?

1:11:07.966 --> 1:11:09.306
It's when it's unexpected.

1:11:14.577 --> 1:11:15.411
You...

1:11:18.647 --> 1:11:20.042
You don't get a proper goodbye.

1:11:23.883 --> 1:11:25.817
- The stars never leave the sky.

1:11:27.018 --> 1:11:29.557
Even in daylight, when
we can't see them,

1:11:29.592 --> 1:11:30.591
they're still there.

1:11:35.697 --> 1:11:37.763
- It's why we're gonna live.

1:11:37.798 --> 1:11:38.830
It's why we must live.

1:11:41.098 --> 1:11:42.669
It's why he's alive.

1:11:43.969 --> 1:11:44.968
Okay?

1:11:45.003 --> 1:11:45.804
- Okay.

1:11:49.909 --> 1:11:52.074
- Just say your prayers
and go to sleep.

1:12:00.788 --> 1:12:02.887
- Should probably get some rest.

1:12:02.922 --> 1:12:03.756
- Yeah.

1:12:05.155 --> 1:12:05.989
Yeah.

1:12:13.130 --> 1:12:16.835
Say it.

1:12:16.870 --> 1:12:18.441
- Say what?

1:12:18.476 --> 1:12:20.905
- Say he's alive.

1:12:20.940 --> 1:12:23.039
- He's alive, okay?

1:12:23.074 --> 1:12:23.974
- Say it like you mean it.

1:12:24.009 --> 1:12:25.008
- All right.

1:12:25.912 --> 1:12:27.978
- I don't believe you.

1:12:28.013 --> 1:12:29.111
- He's alive.

1:12:29.146 --> 1:12:30.519
- I can't hear you.

1:12:30.554 --> 1:12:31.652
- He's alive.

1:12:36.219 --> 1:12:38.153
- You're goddamn right.

1:13:35.685 --> 1:13:36.486
What is it?

1:13:38.149 --> 1:13:40.182
- The man's like
a damn bloodhound!

1:13:42.593 --> 1:13:44.054
- I thought you said he
never came in this far.

1:13:45.024 --> 1:13:46.892
- No.

1:13:46.927 --> 1:13:49.994
What I said is he never had
any reason to come over here,

1:13:51.163 --> 1:13:53.833
but now he's tracking new
prey, we've left a blood trail,

1:13:53.868 --> 1:13:55.637
it's like a map right to us.

1:13:55.672 --> 1:13:58.541
I shouldn't have been so stupid
as to go along with that.

1:13:59.577 --> 1:14:00.169
- It's my fault.

1:14:01.678 --> 1:14:02.743
I was careless.

1:14:04.142 --> 1:14:05.713
Fuck.

1:14:05.748 --> 1:14:07.682
I should have taken
better precautions.

1:14:09.752 --> 1:14:10.982
I know better than that.

1:14:19.157 --> 1:14:19.991
- Ivan.

1:14:21.797 --> 1:14:23.126
There are three sets of tracks.

1:14:25.966 --> 1:14:29.099
Somehow they found
a third person.

1:14:31.004 --> 1:14:32.036
Who could that be?

1:14:39.111 --> 1:14:43.014
I can only think of one
whose body I never found.

1:14:48.351 --> 1:14:49.218
Flush them out.

1:14:54.830 --> 1:14:56.797
I already cut out your tongue.

1:14:58.328 --> 1:15:01.032
Yet your hesitation
speaks volumes.

1:15:02.101 --> 1:15:04.233
As does your
concentration on me.

1:15:06.875 --> 1:15:08.644
Shall I tear out
your eyes as well?

1:15:12.210 --> 1:15:13.044
Go.

1:15:15.818 --> 1:15:16.652
Go!

1:15:27.192 --> 1:15:28.763
- Oh, now where did he go?

1:15:29.700 --> 1:15:30.897
- I don't know.

1:15:31.900 --> 1:15:34.065
But I don't like being
trapped in like this.

1:15:38.170 --> 1:15:39.972
- What's happening?

1:15:41.371 --> 1:15:42.304
- The Baron's here.

1:15:43.241 --> 1:15:44.141
He's watching us.

1:15:48.081 --> 1:15:49.619
- Oh God.

1:15:49.654 --> 1:15:50.719
What are we gonna do?

1:15:51.855 --> 1:15:54.151
- Well, the only other
option is to go out the back,

1:15:54.186 --> 1:15:55.790
that's a 20 foot drop.

1:15:57.288 --> 1:15:59.860
And then you're in the
range of his rifle fire.

1:16:04.427 --> 1:16:07.098
I guess we wait for the
Wolf to come for us.

1:16:08.134 --> 1:16:08.935
I don't know.

1:17:55.142 --> 1:17:55.976
Hey!

1:18:06.351 --> 1:18:07.515
- We have to go!

1:18:07.550 --> 1:18:08.890
- We can't leave him.

1:18:08.925 --> 1:18:10.287
- Get outta here!

1:18:10.322 --> 1:18:11.827
- Come on,
it's our only chance.

1:18:31.948 --> 1:18:34.113
- Ah, the hunt is back on.

1:19:01.978 --> 1:19:06.574
- I suppose everyone
must lose a loyal dog

1:19:06.609 --> 1:19:08.246
at some point in their lives.

1:19:15.024 --> 1:19:15.858
Rainsford!

1:19:16.960 --> 1:19:17.992
I'm coming for you!

1:19:18.027 --> 1:19:19.059
- Where are we going?

1:19:21.393 --> 1:19:22.865
- Well, if we're gonna assume

1:19:24.264 --> 1:19:26.396
that the doctor just left
Ivan that parting gift

1:19:31.007 --> 1:19:35.944
and the Baron is without
his beloved bloodhound,

1:19:37.574 --> 1:19:39.310
I say we make a
run for that ship.

1:19:40.412 --> 1:19:41.246
- Okay.

1:19:41.281 --> 1:19:42.082
Okay, let's go.

1:19:57.528 --> 1:19:58.428
It's okay.

1:19:58.463 --> 1:19:59.363
- Oh, are you sure?

1:19:59.398 --> 1:20:00.969
- Yes.

1:20:01.004 --> 1:20:03.169
- Okay, okay, just
hold on, stop moving.

1:20:03.204 --> 1:20:04.907
Gimme a second, I'm gonna
get you outta there.

1:20:24.225 --> 1:20:25.587
- Sanger, you have to go.

1:20:26.997 --> 1:20:28.458
- Mary, I'm not leaving you.

1:20:28.493 --> 1:20:30.361
- You have to.

1:20:30.396 --> 1:20:31.560
We can't let him win.

1:20:33.399 --> 1:20:36.367
- I made a promise to you
and I intend on keeping it.

1:20:36.402 --> 1:20:38.501
- The only way you're
gonna keep that promise is

1:20:38.536 --> 1:20:40.470
if you survive.

1:20:46.577 --> 1:20:48.379
He's aiming for you, not me.

1:20:48.414 --> 1:20:50.348
You're the one he's hunting.

1:20:52.319 --> 1:20:53.384
- I'm coming back for you.

1:21:20.479 --> 1:21:21.412
- Get back!

1:21:22.481 --> 1:21:24.646
- Such a futile attempt.

1:21:24.681 --> 1:21:27.990
You've been captured, my
dear, and there is no escape.

1:21:31.061 --> 1:21:31.686
I must say,

1:21:33.690 --> 1:21:37.494
Mr. Rainsford and you have
been quite fun to chase.

1:21:40.598 --> 1:21:41.465
- Is he dead?

1:21:42.634 --> 1:21:44.567
- I've learned that if I
can't physically see the body

1:21:44.602 --> 1:21:47.108
of my prey, I must
assume them alive.

1:21:51.147 --> 1:21:53.378
That is where this
little hunt of ours

1:21:54.282 --> 1:21:56.150
has become quite interesting.

1:21:58.055 --> 1:21:58.988
- What do you mean?

1:22:00.618 --> 1:22:01.991
- Well, I too am good at traps,

1:22:02.026 --> 1:22:03.421
as you can see for yourself.

1:22:05.227 --> 1:22:07.491
When I knew you were
holed up in that shack,

1:22:07.526 --> 1:22:09.460
I set several around the area,

1:22:09.495 --> 1:22:12.496
not knowing precisely
which way you would flee.

1:22:15.171 --> 1:22:17.633
This has given
way to a new idea,

1:22:19.802 --> 1:22:24.079
much like how the Indians
taught me how to hunt a tiger.

1:22:26.281 --> 1:22:31.284
One must use live bait
sometimes to catch big game.

1:22:33.585 --> 1:22:35.255
And bait you are, my dear.

1:24:30.801 --> 1:24:34.275
In India, in Africa,

1:24:35.674 --> 1:24:38.774
they use a stake to tie off
a little pig or lamb to.

1:24:41.878 --> 1:24:44.714
Live bait for big game, you see.

1:24:45.684 --> 1:24:46.782
Dangerous game.

1:24:48.489 --> 1:24:49.884
The most dangerous game.

1:24:52.625 --> 1:24:54.295
And like I said,

1:24:54.330 --> 1:24:58.497
humans can reason, but
they also have empathy.

1:25:00.798 --> 1:25:03.700
And the fear of
leaving one behind is

1:25:03.735 --> 1:25:05.537
too great a burden for some.

1:25:08.212 --> 1:25:10.245
I think it weakness,
quite frankly.

1:25:11.809 --> 1:25:12.742
- You are heartless!

1:25:14.944 --> 1:25:16.647
- Oh yes, I've
heard this before.

1:25:17.815 --> 1:25:18.649
But no matter.

1:25:19.852 --> 1:25:23.753
A lion need not listen to
the opinion of a little lamb.

1:25:27.660 --> 1:25:29.297
We will wait.

1:25:29.332 --> 1:25:31.662
And we will see if
Rainsford comes for you.

1:25:32.830 --> 1:25:34.500
- I hope he doesn't
come back at all.

1:25:35.866 --> 1:25:37.965
- Why would you
say such a thing?

1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:39.703
- So that you know defeat.

1:25:40.906 --> 1:25:44.411
So that you feel the loss of
the greatest hunt of your life.

1:25:51.519 --> 1:25:54.289
- It is the greatest
hunt of my life,

1:25:56.986 --> 1:25:58.491
but I will win, my dear,

1:26:00.627 --> 1:26:02.726
and Rainsford's head
will find my wall.

1:26:04.796 --> 1:26:06.895
- That is never gonna happen.

1:26:06.930 --> 1:26:08.567
He will not come back.

1:26:11.836 --> 1:26:12.670
- We will see.

1:26:15.675 --> 1:26:16.509
We will see.

1:26:18.711 --> 1:26:19.710
Oh, Rainsford!

1:26:43.868 --> 1:26:45.736
- Hate to say I told you so.

1:26:46.772 --> 1:26:47.738
- Be quiet.

1:26:49.511 --> 1:26:52.611
- Sanger is much,
much smarter than you.

1:26:52.646 --> 1:26:53.744
Stronger too.

1:26:54.945 --> 1:26:55.944
- I said, be quiet.

1:26:57.147 --> 1:27:00.685
- He's probably found your boat
by now and already set sail.

1:27:03.822 --> 1:27:05.327
- It takes two to operate.

1:27:08.860 --> 1:27:10.695
He's still here.

1:27:10.730 --> 1:27:11.795
He's just being a coward!

1:27:13.502 --> 1:27:14.765
- He is no coward.

1:27:16.439 --> 1:27:18.032
How's Ivan doing, by the way?

1:27:18.936 --> 1:27:20.771
Man's best friend.

1:27:24.480 --> 1:27:27.778
- You know, when the lion
or tiger doesn't come

1:27:27.813 --> 1:27:32.321
for the bait, they stick it.

1:27:33.357 --> 1:27:34.488
So it bleeds.

1:27:37.559 --> 1:27:39.460
Maybe we stick your
little piggy here!

1:27:40.663 --> 1:27:44.762
Maybe her screams and her
squeals will make you come out

1:27:44.797 --> 1:27:46.995
and face your fate!

1:27:54.840 --> 1:27:57.379
Bullets coming down with no arc.

1:27:59.977 --> 1:28:01.317
Where are you?

1:28:10.625 --> 1:28:12.053
There you are, there you are.

1:28:14.926 --> 1:28:17.993
That must
have been you!

1:28:18.028 --> 1:28:19.335
I must have hit you!

1:28:26.168 --> 1:28:28.003
I must have got him,
I must have got him.

1:28:32.878 --> 1:28:35.516
How did he get a rifle anyhow?

1:28:35.551 --> 1:28:37.045
Where, where?

1:28:39.049 --> 1:28:39.850
Damn you!

1:28:47.024 --> 1:28:48.661
He has to, he has to
be out of bullets.

1:28:48.696 --> 1:28:50.058
He has to, right?

1:28:57.771 --> 1:28:59.936
He has to reload,
he has to reload!

1:29:19.991 --> 1:29:20.825
Rainsford.

1:29:24.193 --> 1:29:25.896
You're more quiet
than the jaguar.

1:29:27.064 --> 1:29:28.767
A true beast of prey.

1:29:30.969 --> 1:29:32.408
- Baron Von Wolf.

1:29:36.172 --> 1:29:39.778
- I must say, it looks
like you have won the game.

1:29:42.244 --> 1:29:46.554
Shall we have some port and
discuss how I will get you home?

1:29:48.591 --> 1:29:49.425
- Home?

1:29:51.825 --> 1:29:54.661
A few days ago, I
watched my father die

1:29:54.696 --> 1:29:57.895
in this chair by your hand.

1:30:00.999 --> 1:30:04.000
Now I'm gonna watch
you die by mine.

1:30:19.985 --> 1:30:20.951
- I see.

1:30:24.990 --> 1:30:29.960
Well, one of us will
feed the birds tonight.

1:30:32.767 --> 1:30:37.066
And the other shall sleep
in my very comfortable bed.

1:30:45.109 --> 1:30:48.077
En garde, Mr. Rainsford.

1:31:59.183 --> 1:31:59.984
- We made it.

1:32:01.086 --> 1:32:02.052
Thank God.

1:32:04.254 --> 1:32:05.957
- It's not over yet.

1:32:05.992 --> 1:32:06.826
- What?

1:32:10.799 --> 1:32:12.062
- I made a promise to you.

1:32:14.165 --> 1:32:19.069
Look, again, after
seeing your father,

1:32:22.305 --> 1:32:25.273
are you gonna go back
to wherever it is
you came from, or...

1:32:30.148 --> 1:32:32.621
- I've never seen
New York before.
