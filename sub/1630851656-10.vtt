00:04.728 --> 00:05.833
There's not just
a cop down there.

00:05.867 --> 00:07.041
There's something else.

00:09.802 --> 00:10.976
What the hell's going on?!

00:12.840 --> 00:14.842
This thing's a cure for death.

00:14.876 --> 00:18.673
What's the one thing that
we all have in common?

00:18.708 --> 00:19.847
We all die.

00:19.881 --> 00:21.021
<i>Until this morning.</i>

00:21.055 --> 00:22.436
This is a miracle.

00:22.470 --> 00:24.576
Death is no longer the end.

00:24.610 --> 00:25.887
Dead is dead.

00:29.443 --> 00:30.237
Ahhhh!!!!

00:33.688 --> 00:34.931
Dad?

00:36.864 --> 00:38.072
<i>Jai: Where are you taking us?</i>

00:38.107 --> 00:39.349
Somewhere safe.

00:39.384 --> 00:41.179
There are other survivors
at Paymart.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.353
You can't do this.

00:43.388 --> 00:45.355
I didn't do anything!

00:45.390 --> 00:46.529
We didn't survive this long

00:46.563 --> 00:48.496
just to have someone start
killing us from the inside!

00:50.912 --> 00:52.190
This looks safe to you?

00:52.224 --> 00:53.950
Why do they have us locked
in a building

00:53.984 --> 00:55.193
<i>in the middle of nowhere?</i>

00:55.227 --> 00:56.297
<i>Luke: What the hell is that?</i>

00:56.332 --> 00:57.505
<i>Jai: It's exhaust.</i>

00:57.540 --> 00:59.024
Okay, that could kill us, right?

00:59.059 --> 01:00.198
Open the fucking door!

01:00.232 --> 01:01.647
Open the door!!!
Let us out!

01:01.682 --> 01:04.443
Guys? Can you hear me?

01:04.478 --> 01:06.204
Hold on, I'm gonna
get you out!

01:10.656 --> 01:12.244
<i>Lauren: They brought us here </i>
to kill us.

01:12.279 --> 01:14.626
Cleargenix is cleaning up
their mess.

01:14.660 --> 01:16.938
We told them where everyone
else was.

01:16.973 --> 01:18.595
Then we have to get
there first.

01:28.260 --> 01:29.986
I told Trent not to stop
for anyone or anything

01:30.020 --> 01:31.263
until they get to Carbondale.

01:31.298 --> 01:32.299
Hmm.

01:32.333 --> 01:34.232
How many times did he hit
on you before he left?

01:34.266 --> 01:35.612
Five.

01:35.647 --> 01:37.545
<i>Luke: Yeah, he's pretty gross.</i>

01:37.580 --> 01:39.892
<i>Paula: He's persistent, </i>
I'll give him that.

01:39.927 --> 01:41.963
I grabbed everything
I could find.

01:53.699 --> 01:54.942
There's blood on this.

01:54.976 --> 01:56.046
Is it your blood?

01:56.081 --> 01:57.220
No.

01:57.255 --> 01:58.980
Then don't worry about it.

01:59.015 --> 02:00.327
Everybody lock and load.

02:00.361 --> 02:02.329
I don't wanna show up
to Paymart half empty.

02:02.363 --> 02:03.157
Okay.

02:04.193 --> 02:05.470
Where's Lauren?

02:08.852 --> 02:13.340
God, this is such a shitty way
to leave you.

02:13.374 --> 02:17.620
I know that,
but we gotta go.

02:17.654 --> 02:18.724
They tried to kill us here

02:18.759 --> 02:22.866
then they might try and kill
everyone at Paymart.

02:22.901 --> 02:25.490
But I won't let anything
happen to Amy.

02:25.524 --> 02:27.802
Okay? I promise.

02:35.120 --> 02:36.811
Got a cigarette?

03:09.879 --> 03:10.845
<i>Blackwood: Come on.</i>

03:10.880 --> 03:12.468
<i>We need to get to Paymart.</i>

03:34.697 --> 03:36.008
Nice tight grouping, sweetheart.

03:36.043 --> 03:36.802
Thanks, Mom.

03:38.183 --> 03:39.253
Shit, they beat us here.

03:40.427 --> 03:42.187
Doesn't look like they
got very far.

03:48.918 --> 03:50.575
I don't see Rhodes anywhere.

03:50.609 --> 03:52.853
If that asshole's still alive,
nobody's safe.

03:59.756 --> 04:01.655
It won't be easy to get in.

04:01.689 --> 04:05.659
This place is sealed up tight
from the... inside.

04:07.005 --> 04:08.558
That's not good.

04:23.953 --> 04:25.851
What the hell happened here?

04:29.890 --> 04:31.167
<i>Paula: Cindy.</i>

05:11.483 --> 05:12.450
My god!

05:17.351 --> 05:19.319
Welcome to fucking Paymart.

06:02.120 --> 06:03.777
Where's Jai?

06:09.230 --> 06:10.231
No.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.720
No. No, he promised.

06:15.754 --> 06:17.066
He promised me he'd be back.

06:17.100 --> 06:19.689
He said everything
would be okay.

06:28.457 --> 06:31.252
I know this doesn't make it
hurt any less,

06:31.287 --> 06:33.669
but if it weren't for Jai
we'd all be dead.

06:40.883 --> 06:42.678
I shouldn't have let him go.

06:42.712 --> 06:45.405
Your husband left because he
thought he could help people,

06:45.439 --> 06:46.889
and he did.

06:46.923 --> 06:48.269
And not just us.

06:48.304 --> 06:50.962
Thanks to Jai a whole lot
of people survived today.

06:50.996 --> 06:53.033
He was a hero.

06:56.588 --> 06:58.418
They're all gone.

07:00.178 --> 07:02.732
My mom.

07:02.767 --> 07:05.183
My dad.

07:05.217 --> 07:06.943
Now Jai.

07:09.187 --> 07:13.363
Why are we fighting so hard
to stay alive?

07:16.677 --> 07:18.576
I didn't know your husband

07:18.610 --> 07:21.993
but I know that life was
so precious to him

07:22.027 --> 07:24.513
that he died to protect it.

07:24.547 --> 07:28.689
If you give up, if
any of us give up,

07:28.724 --> 07:31.796
then his sacrifice
was for nothing.

07:31.830 --> 07:34.592
You want to honor Jai?

07:34.626 --> 07:37.008
Let's wipe these things off
the face of the earth.

07:39.079 --> 07:40.045
Come on.

07:47.984 --> 07:50.815
Amy, where is everybody else?

07:50.849 --> 07:52.437
I'm the only one left.

07:52.472 --> 07:56.614
When the soldiers showed up
I thought we were saved.

07:56.648 --> 07:59.237
But only two of them made it
inside and then they...

08:01.964 --> 08:03.344
They just started shooting.

08:03.379 --> 08:05.001
Goddamn Rhodes.

08:05.036 --> 08:06.555
But nobody stayed dead.

08:06.589 --> 08:08.108
They all came back.

08:13.078 --> 08:14.079
The water.

08:14.114 --> 08:16.703
I killed every one of
those things.

08:16.737 --> 08:18.567
I had no choice.

08:18.601 --> 08:19.706
You did what you had to do.

08:20.741 --> 08:21.501
Go! Go!

08:21.535 --> 08:22.225
Go, go, go!

08:22.260 --> 08:23.192
<i>Amy: It's them.</i>

08:23.779 --> 08:24.745
<i>Blackwood: Rhodes!</i>

08:26.264 --> 08:28.197
Where the hell is she going?

08:28.231 --> 08:29.854
Where the hell are you going?

08:29.888 --> 08:30.958
Paula, go with Luke.

08:30.993 --> 08:33.996
McDermott, you're with me.
Let's get this asshole.

08:58.227 --> 09:02.127
I said I'd be here.
I'm here.

09:27.636 --> 09:29.051
It's time.

09:31.294 --> 09:33.814
It's time to let her go.

09:47.172 --> 09:47.759
Amy-

09:48.795 --> 09:49.312
Jesus!

09:49.347 --> 09:51.867
It's me, it's me.

09:51.901 --> 09:53.869
I coulda killed you.

09:53.903 --> 09:56.009
Thanks for not doing that.

09:56.043 --> 09:57.320
Come on.

10:13.682 --> 10:18.238
So, you were with my dad
when he um...

10:18.272 --> 10:21.275
Yeah, I was there.

10:21.310 --> 10:23.450
Did he say anything about me?

10:23.484 --> 10:24.589
Just that he wanted to say

10:24.624 --> 10:28.351
that he was sorry for being
an asshole.

10:28.386 --> 10:31.285
It wasn't just his fault.

10:31.320 --> 10:34.047
We're both bad
at communicating.

10:34.081 --> 10:35.773
The foundation of any good
relationship is-

10:35.807 --> 10:40.467
Hey, Dr. Oz, no offense but
can we talk about this later?

10:40.501 --> 10:42.227
We're trying not to get
killed here.

10:42.262 --> 10:43.263
Right.

10:46.369 --> 10:50.719
Dr. Oz is a physician,
not a therapist.

10:53.791 --> 10:54.757
Sorry.

11:07.149 --> 11:08.115
Are you guys okay?

11:08.150 --> 11:08.978
Yeah.

11:09.013 --> 11:09.772
Did you find him?

11:09.807 --> 11:10.773
No.

11:13.880 --> 11:14.812
No, no, no, no, no, no!

11:14.846 --> 11:16.814
It's us. It's us.
Don't shoot.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.195
Hey, where's Amy?

11:19.230 --> 11:21.301
She was just behind... me.

11:26.133 --> 11:27.307
Let her go!

11:27.341 --> 11:29.343
I can't do that.

11:30.897 --> 11:33.175
You know what these are,
don't you?

11:35.211 --> 11:37.593
They're perf charges
from the drill site.

11:37.627 --> 11:39.595
He's got enough to take out
half the building.

11:41.390 --> 11:44.048
Drop your guns.

11:44.082 --> 11:46.153
Nobody's getting outta here.

11:50.261 --> 11:53.402
Rhodes, you blow those charges
you're going with them.

11:53.436 --> 11:56.301
No shit, Blackwood.

11:56.336 --> 11:59.511
At least I won't come back
as one of those things!

11:59.546 --> 12:03.239
I'll blow up into
a million pieces.

12:03.274 --> 12:04.447
We all will.

12:04.482 --> 12:06.242
Just shoot him already!

12:06.277 --> 12:07.347
Go ahead.

12:07.381 --> 12:08.417
Do it, sweetheart!

12:08.451 --> 12:09.936
We're all screwed, anyway!

12:09.970 --> 12:11.938
Everybody just calm down.

12:11.972 --> 12:13.940
Rhodes, what do you want?

12:15.286 --> 12:18.220
I never shoulda sent you
down that hole.

12:18.254 --> 12:23.570
I shoulda just filled it up
and drilled somewhere else.

12:23.604 --> 12:27.988
You're the reason
they took that thing out.

12:28.023 --> 12:32.027
You're the reason
this is happening to us!

12:32.061 --> 12:34.788
What the hell is he
talking about?

12:34.823 --> 12:37.273
We found a body at the drill
site yesterday.

12:37.308 --> 12:39.828
It turned out to be the first
one of those... things.

12:39.862 --> 12:41.622
You knew about this yesterday?

12:41.657 --> 12:43.590
Why didn't you do something?
Why didn't you call the police?

12:43.624 --> 12:48.733
I did and your office told
McDermott to leave it alone.

12:48.768 --> 12:49.769
I didn't realize.

12:49.803 --> 12:50.700
None of us did.

12:50.735 --> 12:52.772
You're why my dad
went down there?

12:52.806 --> 12:53.807
You're why he's dead.

12:53.842 --> 12:55.844
You're why he turned
into one of those things.

12:55.878 --> 12:57.949
Cam, I tried to save him,
I swear.

12:57.984 --> 12:59.709
I did everything I could.

13:03.748 --> 13:06.233
We're all fucked, here!

13:06.268 --> 13:07.890
The whole town!

13:09.133 --> 13:11.100
Don't you get it?

13:11.135 --> 13:13.620
We can't leave here.

13:13.654 --> 13:19.488
Or else we'll spread it
to the whole goddamn world!

13:19.522 --> 13:22.146
I tried to make it easy
for you.

13:22.180 --> 13:25.563
You just would have gone
to sleep

13:25.597 --> 13:27.392
and you wouldn't have
woken up.

13:27.427 --> 13:28.842
Yeah, well, guess what,
asshole?

13:28.877 --> 13:31.327
You blew it.
We got out.

13:31.362 --> 13:32.535
And the rest of
the survivors,

13:32.570 --> 13:34.192
they're headed for Carbondale
right now.

13:34.227 --> 13:35.573
Are you crazy?!

13:35.607 --> 13:36.608
You fucked us all!

13:38.645 --> 13:39.197
Get the detonator!

13:43.098 --> 13:44.271
Hey, asshole.

13:52.762 --> 13:55.835
I'm tired of knocking that guy
the fuck out.

14:03.670 --> 14:05.327
I'm sorry.

14:05.361 --> 14:07.363
I'm so sorry.

14:21.308 --> 14:23.966
I hate to say it.

14:24.001 --> 14:26.106
But he's right
about one thing.

14:26.141 --> 14:28.350
Someone's gotta stop
those things.

14:56.965 --> 15:00.140
I need a moment
with my daughter.

15:58.612 --> 16:00.960
Come on.

16:00.994 --> 16:01.961
Come on.

16:04.998 --> 16:05.965
Come on.

16:08.588 --> 16:10.003
Come on, baby.

16:12.764 --> 16:14.180
Come on.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.608
What is all this stuff for?

16:28.642 --> 16:30.955
It's all for Lauren's plan.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.130
Yeah, but what is it?

16:33.164 --> 16:35.546
I don't know.
I'm sure it'll work.

16:35.580 --> 16:36.961
Why does everybody always
have to doubt her?

16:36.996 --> 16:38.376
She's awesome.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.828
Do you have a thing for her?

16:41.862 --> 16:43.554
No.

16:43.588 --> 16:45.280
Oh, my god,
you totally do.

16:45.314 --> 16:47.213
Cam, you have to tell her
how you feel, okay?

16:47.247 --> 16:49.318
You have to tell her
right now.

16:49.353 --> 16:50.940
Forget about what everybody
else thinks.

16:50.975 --> 16:54.289
Just be true to yourself,
believe in yourself.

16:54.323 --> 16:56.153
Oh, I get it.
You're doing me.

16:56.187 --> 16:57.292
That was supposed to be me,
right?

16:57.326 --> 16:58.603
Yeah. It's kind of annoying,
right?

16:58.638 --> 17:00.088
A little bit.

17:04.609 --> 17:06.094
Nice work, guys.

17:06.128 --> 17:11.340
Yeah, it was hard to find
all this stuff but here it is.

17:11.375 --> 17:13.342
Yeah, that's why I said
nice work.

17:17.243 --> 17:18.416
Do you want anything?

17:18.451 --> 17:19.452
No.

17:21.109 --> 17:22.662
I'm good with this.

17:22.696 --> 17:24.215
You guys take the rest.

17:24.250 --> 17:26.838
We'll meet you
at the drill site.

17:26.873 --> 17:28.254
Good luck out there.

17:28.288 --> 17:29.945
Yeah, be careful.

17:37.642 --> 17:38.850
Everything in me

17:38.885 --> 17:41.163
is telling me to get you boys
out of Mawinhaken.

17:41.198 --> 17:43.096
Mom, we're 18.

17:43.131 --> 17:45.823
If we're old enough to vote
for who runs this town

17:45.857 --> 17:48.067
we're old enough
to save it.

17:51.691 --> 17:53.693
I am so proud of you boys.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.043
Let's do this.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.976
Wake up the bait!

18:10.192 --> 18:11.262
What's going on?

18:11.297 --> 18:13.264
We need you to scream
in terror.

18:13.299 --> 18:15.749
What the... what the hell
are you doing?!

18:15.784 --> 18:17.648
<i>Rhodes: Let me go!</i>

18:17.682 --> 18:19.650
<i>You can't do this to me!</i>

18:22.342 --> 18:23.826
Let me go!

18:23.861 --> 18:25.449
Help!

18:25.483 --> 18:27.589
<i>Let me go!</i>

18:27.623 --> 18:28.590
Perfect.

18:28.624 --> 18:30.523
Just like that.

18:30.557 --> 18:33.388
<i>Rhodes: What the hell are </i>
you doing? Why are you...

18:33.422 --> 18:34.906
I got you.

18:35.804 --> 18:38.220
<i>Rhodes: Help! Help! Help!!</i>

18:38.255 --> 18:40.188
<i>Help me!</i>

18:45.089 --> 18:46.677
<i>Rhodes: Let me go!</i>

18:48.506 --> 18:50.750
Help me!

18:50.784 --> 18:51.958
Come on!

18:56.376 --> 18:57.308
<i>Rhodes: Help me!</i>

18:57.343 --> 18:58.965
<i>Come on!</i>

18:58.999 --> 19:01.726
Get away from me!

19:01.761 --> 19:03.763
Get the hell away from me!

19:05.661 --> 19:09.838
<i>Rhodes: Get me off of here.</i>

19:12.910 --> 19:16.638
<i>Rhodes: Get the hell </i>
away from me!

19:16.672 --> 19:18.709
You assholes are gonna
get me killed!

19:18.743 --> 19:20.952
Relax, we need you.

19:22.575 --> 19:23.576
For now.

19:26.234 --> 19:27.200
This is crazy.

19:31.549 --> 19:32.619
I can't believe
this is working.

19:32.654 --> 19:33.551
<i>Rhodes: Can this </i>
go any faster!

19:33.586 --> 19:35.139
Me neither.

19:35.174 --> 19:38.073
Wait, but this was
your idea.

19:38.107 --> 19:40.075
Yeah, but I didn't know
it would actually work.

19:43.561 --> 19:44.355
<i>Rhodes: Oh!</i>

19:45.149 --> 19:45.977
Oh shit.

19:46.012 --> 19:47.289
What's happening?

19:47.324 --> 19:48.704
The engine died.

19:50.085 --> 19:51.742
<i>Rhodes: What the hell </i>
are you doing?

19:51.776 --> 19:53.122
<i>They're getting closer.</i>

19:53.157 --> 19:54.158
<i>Move this shit!</i>

20:02.270 --> 20:03.236
Quit screwing around.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.204
Get it moving!

20:05.859 --> 20:06.688
Come on!

20:07.102 --> 20:08.103
Come on!

20:13.281 --> 20:16.732
Tell him to put the pedal
all the way down to the floor.

20:16.767 --> 20:18.320
It'll open the butterfly.

20:18.355 --> 20:19.494
I said shut up!

20:19.528 --> 20:21.185
You think I wanna die
back here?

20:23.049 --> 20:24.050
Tell him!

20:26.880 --> 20:28.882
Put the pedal to the floor
and crank it, sweetheart!

20:29.952 --> 20:30.953
Come on!

20:38.444 --> 20:39.652
Fuck it.

20:45.796 --> 20:47.004
We kissed.

20:47.038 --> 20:47.832
Okay?

20:47.867 --> 20:48.730
Whatever.

20:48.764 --> 20:49.903
Don't make a big deal
out of it.

20:49.938 --> 20:50.525
I didn't say anything.

20:50.559 --> 20:51.353
Shut up.

20:51.388 --> 20:52.975
I didn't say anything.

21:33.464 --> 21:36.571
<i>Blackwood: Government shut these </i>
coal mines down in the '80's.

21:36.605 --> 21:37.986
<i>They go on for miles.</i>

21:38.987 --> 21:40.989
This is the only way out.

21:43.302 --> 21:46.443
Do you really think
this is gonna work?

21:46.477 --> 21:48.099
My ancestors trapped
one of those things

21:48.134 --> 21:50.516
in a hole for 300 years.

21:52.276 --> 21:54.451
I don't see why it couldn't
work again.

22:04.633 --> 22:07.326
Don't touch me!

22:07.360 --> 22:09.845
Don't touch me!!!

22:09.880 --> 22:11.916
How much longer
until we get there?

22:11.951 --> 22:13.124
Just a few more miles.

22:13.159 --> 22:14.678
Good.

22:14.712 --> 22:16.611
'Cause if I have to listen
to this pussy much longer

22:16.645 --> 22:17.646
I'll kill him myself.

22:17.681 --> 22:19.993
<i>Rhodes: Let me down! </i>
I don't deserve this!

22:23.169 --> 22:23.997
<i>Rhodes: Please!</i>

22:25.861 --> 22:27.346
<i>Lauren: Drive a little faster, </i>
Luke!

22:27.380 --> 22:28.657
<i>They're getting closer!</i>

22:29.865 --> 22:32.558
<i>Luke, speed up! </i>
Shit!

22:32.592 --> 22:33.593
Dad.

22:40.497 --> 22:41.463
Cam?

22:43.879 --> 22:45.364
Wait, stop the truck!

22:46.537 --> 22:48.021
Stop the truck!

22:48.056 --> 22:49.160
<i>Rhodes: What are you doing?!</i>

22:49.195 --> 22:50.403
What's happening?!

22:50.438 --> 22:52.888
<i>Rhodes: Move this piece of shit! </i>
I'm gonna die back here!

22:52.923 --> 22:54.718
<i>Lauren: It's Cam. </i>
He's gone.

22:56.236 --> 22:58.066
I don't see him!

23:00.482 --> 23:01.449
Cam!

23:07.627 --> 23:09.526
<i>Rhodes: You're gonna get us </i>
all killed!

23:09.560 --> 23:10.975
Lauren, get back in the truck!

23:11.010 --> 23:12.563
No, we can't leave him!

23:12.598 --> 23:13.806
Yeah, well if we stay here
any longer

23:13.840 --> 23:15.014
this whole plan goes to shit.

23:15.048 --> 23:16.429
We need to move, now!

23:17.672 --> 23:18.431
Cam!

23:18.466 --> 23:19.639
<i>Paula: Lauren, now!</i>

23:20.640 --> 23:22.746
<i>Rhodes: Quite </i>
screwing around!

23:22.780 --> 23:24.989
<i>Let's get outta here.</i>

23:25.024 --> 23:26.612
Honey, we gotta go.

23:27.716 --> 23:29.028

23:36.829 --> 23:39.107
<i>Let's go, let's go, let's go.</i>

24:06.341 --> 24:08.447
<i>Rhodes: What the hell </i>
are we doing out here!

24:08.481 --> 24:10.103
<i>Let me go!</i>

24:13.521 --> 24:14.383
<i>Blackwood: Son of a bitch!</i>

24:14.418 --> 24:15.592
<i>They did it!</i>

24:21.045 --> 24:22.046
Oh, no!

24:22.771 --> 24:23.772
Shit!

24:25.533 --> 24:26.568
Goddamn it.

24:29.813 --> 24:32.194
We just need to lead them a
little bit farther to the mine.

24:32.229 --> 24:33.126
This truck's
not going anywhere.

24:33.161 --> 24:34.162
Leave it.

24:34.196 --> 24:35.646
We'll have to find
another way.

24:35.681 --> 24:36.992
Where's Cam?

24:43.067 --> 24:44.828
<i>Rhodes: What're you doing?</i>

24:44.862 --> 24:46.864
You can't leave me here!

24:46.899 --> 24:48.003
What about him?

24:48.038 --> 24:49.246
Who cares? He tried
to kill us.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.558
Hey, Luke.

24:51.490 --> 24:52.491
Cover me.

24:54.009 --> 24:55.632
I'll lower him down.

24:59.152 --> 25:00.947
I thought you were gonna
leave me here to die.

25:00.982 --> 25:02.639
We're not murderers.

25:02.673 --> 25:03.916
You're worse.

25:03.950 --> 25:05.607
You're cowards.

25:05.642 --> 25:07.954
You just left that kid
to save your own asses.

25:07.989 --> 25:09.956
Shut up, asshole!

25:13.373 --> 25:15.375
I was willing to die
to stop this!

25:22.590 --> 25:23.694
Then die.

25:25.075 --> 25:28.181
Hey! What are you doing?

25:28.216 --> 25:29.217
No!

25:34.429 --> 25:35.430
Ahhhh!!!!!

25:38.882 --> 25:40.849
Ahhhh!!!!!

25:52.033 --> 25:55.830
Choke on 'em!
Choke on 'em!!

26:07.462 --> 26:08.463
Now what?

26:10.810 --> 26:12.916
We get them into that mine.

26:27.551 --> 26:29.208
What the hell are you doing?

26:29.242 --> 26:30.312
I'll lead them in.

26:30.347 --> 26:32.383
Once they're inside, use
these to blow up the cave.

26:32.418 --> 26:33.868
Woah, woah, woah.
You can't do this.

26:33.902 --> 26:35.076
We're not gonna let her do this,
right?

26:35.110 --> 26:36.767
It's not your choice.

26:36.802 --> 26:40.219
Hey, you ugly sons of bitches!
Come and get me!

26:43.153 --> 26:47.295
Blackwood, this is crazy!
It's suicide!

26:47.329 --> 26:49.159
I can make it out.

26:52.024 --> 26:54.233
There's gotta be another way.

26:54.267 --> 26:55.855
We all know there isn't.

26:55.890 --> 26:57.961
Besides, somebody's gotta
stay alive long enough

26:57.995 --> 26:58.996
to set these off.

27:05.520 --> 27:06.797
I'm serious.

27:06.832 --> 27:08.178
Whether I'm out or not.

27:08.212 --> 27:11.181
You seal the place shut,
otherwise this is all
for nothing.

27:14.494 --> 27:15.944
I will.

27:15.979 --> 27:16.980
Okay.

28:01.231 --> 28:03.233
I'm in here, assholes!

28:47.829 --> 28:50.832
Come and get it!
Fresh meat!

29:23.831 --> 29:26.143
What do you think
you're doing?

29:26.178 --> 29:27.386
Finishing this.

29:27.420 --> 29:28.697
Fuck those things.

29:43.333 --> 29:45.818
Come on. Let's go.

29:55.034 --> 29:56.795
That's all of them.

29:56.829 --> 29:58.866
All right. Let's go.

30:02.835 --> 30:04.630
<i>Amy: How deep do we have </i>
to go?

30:04.664 --> 30:06.943
Until the last
one's inside.

30:06.977 --> 30:08.358
Then what?

30:48.191 --> 30:50.779
They should all be in
by now.

30:50.814 --> 30:53.092
There must be another way
out of here.

30:53.127 --> 30:54.093
There isn't.

30:54.128 --> 30:55.577
That's kinda the point
of leading them in here.

30:55.612 --> 30:56.820
Okay, so what?

30:56.855 --> 30:59.167
We're supposed to just stand
here and wait to get eaten?

31:12.732 --> 31:14.044
Wait, you wanna fight
your way out?

31:14.079 --> 31:17.289
There's like nine bullets
in that thing.

31:17.323 --> 31:19.360
I was thinking
we'd only need three.

31:19.394 --> 31:21.396
Jesus, that's dark.

31:30.371 --> 31:33.167
That psycho Rhodes designed
this thing as a suicide bomb.

31:33.201 --> 31:34.616
We're not gonna be able
to detonate it

31:34.651 --> 31:36.653
without blowing ourselves up.

31:48.354 --> 31:50.011
What're you doing?

31:50.046 --> 31:51.910
Trust your mother, Luke.

32:00.642 --> 32:02.575
Who wants to go first?

32:33.192 --> 32:34.469
Don't!

32:44.376 --> 32:45.342
Quick!

32:45.722 --> 32:47.758
Come on! Let's go!

33:01.358 --> 33:03.222
What if they make it
outta there?

33:03.257 --> 33:04.983
You heard Sarah.

33:05.017 --> 33:07.433
First one of those things I see
coming out of the mine

33:07.468 --> 33:08.779
I'm taking my shot.

33:13.681 --> 33:15.510
Come on, guys.

34:09.564 --> 34:10.531
Okay, let's get outta here.

34:25.477 --> 34:26.926
Go! Run!

34:33.485 --> 34:34.865
Come on!

34:37.420 --> 34:39.077
Come on, guys.

34:39.836 --> 34:42.045

Where are you?

34:52.642 --> 34:54.437
Get outta there.
Come on.

35:14.146 --> 35:15.527
No!

35:15.561 --> 35:16.666
What the hell are you doing?!

35:16.700 --> 35:17.874
There they are!

35:17.908 --> 35:20.497
Blow it! Blow the cave!

36:18.969 --> 36:21.040
What a fucking day.

36:26.598 --> 36:29.152
- Oh, my god!
- Oh, shit.

36:32.155 --> 36:33.467
We did it!

36:38.886 --> 36:40.784
Oh, my gosh!

36:53.590 --> 36:57.560
I got Bobby's truck started
and guess what I found.

37:01.667 --> 37:03.048
Bobby fucking Hart.

37:03.082 --> 37:04.083
Uh-huh.

37:09.296 --> 37:10.849
Go on.

37:10.883 --> 37:12.471
You earned it.

37:20.928 --> 37:21.929
Mmm.

37:24.345 --> 37:27.072
So that's what beer
tastes like.

37:27.106 --> 37:28.487
Right.

37:34.838 --> 37:36.323
I'll take that.

37:47.955 --> 37:54.548
He was so... perfect.

37:54.582 --> 37:59.932
Why does someone like that
have to die?

37:59.967 --> 38:02.280
Because death doesn't
give a shit.

38:02.314 --> 38:05.248
It doesn't care if
you're good or bad.

38:05.283 --> 38:06.870
It just takes.

38:11.185 --> 38:13.152
You wanna get revenge
on death?

38:13.187 --> 38:15.016
You keep living.

38:41.319 --> 38:44.598
Do you think this is
really over?

38:44.632 --> 38:46.185
Any of those things left
shouldn't be too hard

38:46.220 --> 38:48.118
for someone to take care of.

38:48.153 --> 38:53.158
As long as no one opens
that mine we should be good.

39:04.514 --> 39:06.482
I know you're in there.

39:09.070 --> 39:11.797
That's why you saved me,
isn't it?

39:34.441 --> 39:37.236
You remember me,
don't you?

39:44.071 --> 39:45.037
Here.

39:49.490 --> 39:51.043
Take it!

39:51.078 --> 39:52.907
