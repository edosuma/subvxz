Ten years ago
when I was a student

00:04.792 --> 00:09.667
and Red was on the coaching
staff, we had an affair.

00:09.667 --> 00:11.667
College girls hook up
with older men all the time.

00:11.667 --> 00:14.500
What makes this one time
so horribly embarrassing?

00:14.500 --> 00:15.667
He had a wife.

00:15.667 --> 00:16.375
She found out that Red

00:16.375 --> 00:17.458
was sleeping with his student

00:17.458 --> 00:19.208
and Emily left him.

Would you like to comment
on our story?

00:30.875 --> 00:32.290
It helps if you speak into this.

Since when are you
and Betsy friends?

00:39.458 --> 00:40.500
We're not.

00:40.500 --> 00:42.375
I-I got a paper

00:42.375 --> 00:44.667

what happened to the details

'that we were talking about?'

01:23.917 --> 01:25.250
'Let's try it again.'

Let's clean it up.

[music continues]

01:34.375 --> 01:35.750
Today's topic.

01:35.750 --> 01:36.792
Why do white guys always bite

01:36.792 --> 01:38.417
their lips when they dance?

01:38.417 --> 01:40.542
Oh, it gives them focus
while engaging in a foreign act.

01:42.542 --> 01:43.917
This guy is gonna draw blood.

01:43.917 --> 01:45.125
Uh, might attract a shark.

01:45.125 --> 01:46.417
We're on land.

01:46.417 --> 01:48.417
Uh, a shark with feet.

01:48.417 --> 01:49.750
Evolution is real, my friend.

01:53.083 --> 01:54.542
Who is this guy, anyway?

01:54.542 --> 01:56.375
New athletic director.

01:56.375 --> 01:57.959
If that's a joke,
it's a fantastic one.

01:57.959 --> 01:59.417
[laughs]
Seriously.

01:59.417 --> 02:01.625
Dean Laverne used to be
dean of students.

02:01.625 --> 02:03.125
'The word is
the trustees wanted'

02:03.125 --> 02:04.583

02:05.250 --> 02:06.333
Oh.

02:06.333 --> 02:07.917
- Ohh.
- Ohh.

02:07.917 --> 02:09.291
Internal promotion.

02:09.291 --> 02:10.959
And that, my friend

02:10.959 --> 02:12.458
is what comes of in-breeding.

02:12.458 --> 02:13.959
That was much better.

02:13.959 --> 02:15.041
Good work, Hellcats.

02:15.041 --> 02:18.750
Wow. Can I just say wow?

02:18.750 --> 02:20.792
You guys have tasty some moves.

02:20.792 --> 02:22.583
Tasty moves?

interim athletic director'

02:24.000 --> 02:25.458
'let me just thank you all'

02:25.458 --> 02:27.291
for taking on
all this extra rehearsal.

02:27.291 --> 02:28.625
I guarantee, you are all going

02:28.625 --> 02:31.417
to shine
at the St. John's benefit.

02:31.417 --> 02:34.417
'I assure you,
it is for a good cause.'

02:34.417 --> 02:37.583
Now, as you all know,
the athletic department

02:37.583 --> 02:39.125
has taken a bit of a black eye

02:39.125 --> 02:42.500
with our star quarterback
behind bars.

02:42.500 --> 02:44.792
'We have an image problem.'

02:44.792 --> 02:47.291
You guys and gals
are the face of Lancer.

02:48.834 --> 02:51.041
And in the months to come,
your school

02:51.041 --> 02:52.333
will be depending on you

02:52.333 --> 02:54.500
to get out there
and reinforce our image

02:54.500 --> 02:57.458
as a school with honor,
integrity...

02:57.458 --> 02:58.708
And tasty moves.

02:58.708 --> 03:00.667
- ...and above all...
- Tasty moves.

03:00.667 --> 03:02.792
Come on, say it.

03:02.792 --> 03:04.000
Showmanship.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.667
Oh, disappointed.

03:05.667 --> 03:07.375
Well done. Well done.

03:07.375 --> 03:09.500
Congratulations.
That was excellent.

03:09.500 --> 03:10.875
Excellent job.

03:10.875 --> 03:12.667
Oh, hey.

03:12.667 --> 03:14.166
Good job, everybody.

03:14.166 --> 03:16.166
'Well done.'

03:16.166 --> 03:17.834
Can I interest you in some tea?

03:17.834 --> 03:18.875
I make it special.

03:18.875 --> 03:20.458
That sounds lovely.

03:22.041 --> 03:23.792
We've known each other
a while, right?

03:23.792 --> 03:25.333
- Two years.
- Wow.

03:26.458 --> 03:27.834
I need a little help.

03:27.834 --> 03:29.583
What's on your mind?

03:29.583 --> 03:32.750
You're friendly with, uh,
Coach Raymond, aren't you?

03:32.750 --> 03:34.041
I knew all the coaches.

03:34.041 --> 03:36.375
(Laverne) 'Yeah,
but since Derrick left...'

03:36.375 --> 03:38.750
I'm sorry to hear about that,
by the way.

03:38.750 --> 03:40.708
- Thanks.
- 'Don't mention it.'

03:40.708 --> 03:42.750
It's just I've noticed
you having breakfast

03:42.750 --> 03:45.083
with Red down at The Rat, so...

03:45.083 --> 03:46.250
Uh, now and then.

03:46.250 --> 03:48.208
But, uh, now that I know
you hang out

03:48.208 --> 03:50.041
at The Rat,
I'll have breakfast with you.

03:50.041 --> 03:51.375
- Thank you.
- I'm sociable.

03:51.375 --> 03:53.125
No doubt, no doubt.

03:55.208 --> 03:56.708
You were a student back when Red

03:56.708 --> 03:59.708
'was just the assistant
offensive coordinator.'

03:59.708 --> 04:01.375
You ever meet his wife
at the time?

04:01.375 --> 04:02.542
Emily?

04:04.500 --> 04:06.333
Uh, I think so, once.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.625
Long time ago.

04:08.625 --> 04:11.208
Anything you can tell me
about their marriage?

04:11.208 --> 04:12.542
Particularly, the divorce.

04:14.291 --> 04:16.041
Can I ask why you're asking?

04:16.041 --> 04:18.375
Just trying to get a bead
on why that marriage ended.

04:19.875 --> 04:21.916
It's never come up.

04:21.916 --> 04:23.750
Red's not really the kind of guy

04:23.750 --> 04:25.041
who dwells on the past.

04:25.041 --> 04:26.708
Well, sometimes the past

04:26.708 --> 04:28.458
has a way of catching
up with you.

04:30.583 --> 04:33.959
Earl Grey and Green...together?

04:33.959 --> 04:35.917
That's pretty radical.

04:40.667 --> 04:41.792
How's the foot?

04:41.792 --> 04:43.208
Sore, but I can still kick

04:43.208 --> 04:44.625
a deserving ass if called upon.

04:44.625 --> 04:46.625
I will keep my distance.

04:46.625 --> 04:48.375
I expect a full recovery.

04:48.375 --> 04:50.166
[indistinct chatter]

04:50.166 --> 04:51.750
What do you think
that's about?

04:51.750 --> 04:53.458
Probably didn't put
the seat down again.

04:53.458 --> 04:55.208

'Okay, but what
am I supposed to do?

04:55.208 --> 04:57.000
Hey, what's going on?

04:57.000 --> 04:58.583
Everything okay?

04:59.667 --> 05:02.250
Yeah, it's nothing.

'Lewis is about
to get in trouble'

05:03.417 --> 05:04.500
with the school for cheating.

05:04.500 --> 05:06.166
Wait, what?

05:06.166 --> 05:08.250
And he's refusing to defend
himself in honor court.

05:08.250 --> 05:09.583
You cheated?

05:09.583 --> 05:10.792
Yeah, I don't want
to talk about it.

05:10.792 --> 05:13.000
Lewis, this is a big deal.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.417
Honor court is just
like real court.

05:14.417 --> 05:15.917
The decisions can hurt you.

05:15.917 --> 05:17.834
Yeah, I said I don't want
to talk about it.

05:20.959 --> 05:22.667
I got this.

05:22.667 --> 05:23.667
'Hey.'

05:26.291 --> 05:28.291
What's going on?

05:28.291 --> 05:29.708
Nothing.

05:29.708 --> 05:32.625
You know, I'll find out,
one way or another.

05:32.625 --> 05:34.542
I just got back
from the Dean's office.

05:34.542 --> 05:37.000
You know that article that came
out about the cheating scandal?

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Yeah, they busted Betsy
Sullenger from girls volleyball.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.166
Couldn't have happened
to a nicer athletic discipline.

05:42.166 --> 05:44.959
Yeah, well, Betsy cut a deal
with the Dean.

05:44.959 --> 05:46.708
She kept a list of every student

05:46.708 --> 05:48.291
that ever bought
a paper from her.

05:48.291 --> 05:51.375
W-wait. You're trying to tell me
you're on the list?

05:51.375 --> 05:54.041
You bought a paper? You?

05:54.041 --> 05:55.959
Oh, wow.

05:55.959 --> 05:57.208
I'm facing suspension.

05:57.208 --> 05:58.667
I do not need you
laughing at me.

05:58.667 --> 06:00.000
Come on.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.166
You once backtracked a mile

06:01.166 --> 06:02.208
to a convenience store

06:02.208 --> 06:03.500
because they undercharged you.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.333
What do you want me
to say, Marti?

06:05.333 --> 06:06.959
I did it.

06:06.959 --> 06:09.458
I just want to take
my licks and move on.

06:09.458 --> 06:11.166
Okay, I don't really know
what's going on

06:11.166 --> 06:13.166
but you have to take
this seriously.

06:13.166 --> 06:15.834
If they convict you, you'll fail
whatever course it was.

06:15.834 --> 06:18.208
Lewis, it will kill your GPA.

06:18.208 --> 06:19.333
My GPA can take it.

06:19.333 --> 06:20.834
Whatever.
Let's talk honor court.

06:20.834 --> 06:22.208
Have you been assigned
student defense counsel?

06:22.208 --> 06:23.542
Yeah.

06:23.542 --> 06:26.708
Some kid named,
uh...Lars Putnam.

06:26.708 --> 06:28.208
Lars from Mars?

06:28.208 --> 06:29.375
If you don't slap
his back every now

06:29.375 --> 06:30.959
and then, he forgets to breathe.

06:30.959 --> 06:34.208
You know what? Don't worry.
I know how to fix this.

06:34.208 --> 06:35.583
Stop. No fixing.

06:35.583 --> 06:37.166
No. You're my base.

06:37.166 --> 06:39.041
I'm not letting you
go down without a fight.

06:39.041 --> 06:40.917
I'm serious about this, Marti.

06:40.917 --> 06:42.542
- Just leave it alone.
- You're welcome.

'Alright, people,
Traynor is on the floor'

06:57.875 --> 06:59.542
'with an amendment to 5236.'

06:59.542 --> 07:01.792
I need a full analysis
of this before my sit-down

07:01.792 --> 07:03.750
with Justice Black, alright?

07:03.750 --> 07:05.250
Looks like business is booming.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.375
Miss Perkins.

07:06.375 --> 07:08.083
Welcome to three strikes
central.

07:08.083 --> 07:10.708
Did Bill Marsh's pension
pay for all this?

07:10.708 --> 07:14.250
Revenge is a dish best served
with a large check.

07:14.250 --> 07:16.125
Instead of indentured
student labor

07:16.125 --> 07:18.583
I now actually have
professional paralegals.

07:18.583 --> 07:20.583
Well, your indentured
student laborers miss you.

07:20.583 --> 07:21.959
Well, I'll be back teaching

07:21.959 --> 07:23.917
as soon as I get the
three strikes law overturned

07:23.917 --> 07:25.875
or I run out of cash,
whichever come first.

07:25.875 --> 07:27.291
But we do have a new client

07:27.291 --> 07:28.417
whose case is every bit

07:28.417 --> 07:30.917
as compelling as Travis' was.

07:30.917 --> 07:32.375
We're on track.

07:32.375 --> 07:33.792
I'm really happy for you.

07:33.792 --> 07:35.792
Maybe you can return the favor?

07:35.792 --> 07:36.959
Favor?

07:36.959 --> 07:38.375
Who helped you
take down Bill Marsh

07:38.375 --> 07:40.125
and got you all these
high-priced worker bees?

07:40.125 --> 07:42.000
Okay, out with it.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.291
You're still faculty advisor

07:43.291 --> 07:44.458
on the honor court?

07:44.458 --> 07:45.834
(Julian)
'Yes, I am. Why?'

07:47.625 --> 07:48.917
I want in as a student defender

07:48.917 --> 07:50.625
and I want Lewis Flynn's case.

07:50.625 --> 07:51.834
Lewis?

07:51.834 --> 07:53.125
He's a Hellcat.

07:53.125 --> 07:54.959
- My base.
- Your base?

07:54.959 --> 07:57.291
He lifts me,
throws me in the air.

07:57.291 --> 07:58.875
You know, like cheerleaders do.

08:00.291 --> 08:02.458
What a life you lead.

08:02.458 --> 08:04.750
The point is he's accused
of cheating.

08:04.750 --> 08:06.291
The Betsy Sullenger
thing, right?

08:06.291 --> 08:08.250
Yeah.

08:08.250 --> 08:10.333
Miss Perkins, you've never even

08:10.333 --> 08:12.291
registered for
the honor court program.

08:12.291 --> 08:13.959
And even if you did,
there's a long list

08:13.959 --> 08:15.458
waiting for clients.

08:15.458 --> 08:17.458
To leapfrog ahead
of your pre-law classmates

08:17.458 --> 08:19.083
would be highly inappropriate.

08:19.083 --> 08:20.417
I'm aware of that.

08:20.417 --> 08:22.000
And yet you persist.

08:23.917 --> 08:26.166
Lewis got assigned Lars Putnam.

08:26.166 --> 08:28.333
Lars from Mars.

08:28.333 --> 08:29.333
You know we call him that?

08:29.333 --> 08:30.667
I know everything.

08:30.667 --> 08:32.417
When will you
come to accept that?

08:34.625 --> 08:36.792
Very well,
let me hear your argument.

08:36.792 --> 08:39.332
Why should I deviate
from policy for you?

08:40.667 --> 08:42.375
The intent
of the honor court program

08:42.375 --> 08:43.875
is to provide pre-law students

08:43.875 --> 08:46.166
with the experience
of trying real life cases

08:46.166 --> 08:47.542
with real life stakes.

08:47.542 --> 08:48.667
True.

08:48.667 --> 08:50.166
In ten things every lawyer

08:50.166 --> 08:52.834
does wrong, you wrote
that connections

08:52.834 --> 08:54.000
are half the battle.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.875
A good lawyer
manipulates the system

08:55.875 --> 08:58.625
to secure the right venue,
the right judge

08:58.625 --> 09:00.625
and the right jury.

09:00.625 --> 09:02.291
Calling in favors and exploiting

09:02.291 --> 09:03.542
personal relationships

09:03.542 --> 09:06.000
are an essential part
of the process.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.500
You have quite a memory.

09:07.500 --> 09:08.625
Hmm.

09:10.375 --> 09:11.708
Julian, please.

09:15.166 --> 09:18.917
He's my friend...
and I have to help him.

09:20.542 --> 09:23.375
Well...you can't have justice

09:23.375 --> 09:25.542
without fairness
and it's fair to say

09:25.542 --> 09:27.375
Lars couldn't find
his ass with two hands

09:27.375 --> 09:29.542
and a friendly
Indian guide, so...

09:29.542 --> 09:30.875
- I'm in?
- You're in.

09:30.875 --> 09:31.834
Oh, thank you.

09:33.667 --> 09:35.333
You are aware there are other
people in the room, right?

09:35.333 --> 09:37.625
Oh, yeah, I don't care.

09:37.625 --> 09:38.959
Ahem.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.083
Look alive, people.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.750
I'm paying you good cash money

09:44.750 --> 09:46.542
and I expect to see some hustle.

09:50.583 --> 09:52.375
Hey, has Lewis come back yet?

09:52.375 --> 09:53.917
His trial is set for the day

09:53.917 --> 09:55.208
after the fundraiser
and I need to talk to him.

09:55.208 --> 09:56.542
I haven't seen him.

09:56.542 --> 09:57.583
Well, he's not returning
his messages.

09:57.583 --> 09:58.959
I even tried ambushing him

09:58.959 --> 10:00.583
at his 3D design seminar

10:00.583 --> 10:01.917
but he never showed.

10:01.917 --> 10:03.417
He sometimes takes
his laundry home.

10:03.417 --> 10:05.208
Okay, yeah, that's a good idea.

10:05.208 --> 10:07.125
It's a crap idea.

10:07.125 --> 10:10.250
Obviously, he's freaked out,
embarrassed, avoiding people.

10:10.250 --> 10:11.750
The last place he's gonna go

10:11.750 --> 10:13.250
is home to face mom and dad

10:13.250 --> 10:14.834
who think he walks on water.

10:16.625 --> 10:19.417
Okay, if you're so smart,
where is he?

10:19.417 --> 10:20.792
I have a few ideas.

10:21.792 --> 10:23.166
But why would I tell you?

10:24.792 --> 10:26.625
I took over
as his student advocate

10:26.625 --> 10:29.166
and I discovered
something sketchy.

10:30.166 --> 10:31.333
What did you find out?

10:31.333 --> 10:32.708
That's between me and Lewis.

10:35.125 --> 10:37.625
Just out of curiosity, Marti...

10:37.625 --> 10:38.834
...what makes you think
you're remotely

10:38.834 --> 10:41.000
competent to represent Lewis?

10:41.000 --> 10:43.375
It's a little arrogant,
don't you think?

10:44.959 --> 10:46.291
What do you want, Alice?

10:49.125 --> 10:51.667
Let's share information.

10:51.667 --> 10:53.083
Let me help you help Lewis.

10:53.083 --> 10:55.041
What makes you remotely
competent to help me?

10:55.041 --> 10:56.625
Well, for one thing,
I'm smarter than you.

10:56.625 --> 10:57.917
Oh, you think that, cheerleader?

10:57.917 --> 10:59.458
I do, cheerleader.

11:02.041 --> 11:03.291
Who's the father of geometry?

11:03.291 --> 11:04.625
Who defeated the Lancasters

11:04.625 --> 11:06.000
in the War of the Roses?

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
What's unusual about
Schrodinger's cat?

11:10.000 --> 11:11.667
Answer in any order.

11:11.667 --> 11:13.959
I'm not taking a test for you.

11:13.959 --> 11:15.333
Didn't think so.

11:15.333 --> 11:16.917
I'm asking you.

11:19.208 --> 11:20.375
Please?

11:21.500 --> 11:23.708
Let me help you.

11:23.708 --> 11:25.291
Why?

11:27.708 --> 11:29.208
Lewis is in this mess because

11:29.208 --> 11:31.500
I helped break
the Fotogem story.

11:31.500 --> 11:33.000
'I had no idea it would blow'

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
'back on him like this.'

11:35.000 --> 11:38.708
We're not a couple,
but I care about him.

11:38.708 --> 11:40.291
More than I care
about most people.

11:40.291 --> 11:41.834
If us working together gives him

11:41.834 --> 11:44.125
a better chance
at getting out of this mess

11:44.125 --> 11:45.667
'that's what we need to do.'

11:46.917 --> 11:48.250
Where do we start looking?

11:50.250 --> 11:51.959
The thing you need to know
about Lewis

11:51.959 --> 11:53.875
is when he's feeling guilty...

11:53.875 --> 11:55.583
...he's all about
beating up on himself.

11:56.250 --> 11:58.208
[grunting]

11:59.875 --> 12:01.375
Schrodinger's cat,
by the way

12:01.375 --> 12:03.166
is both alive and dead
at the same time.

12:03.166 --> 12:05.000
It's quantum mechanics
hypothetical.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.083
Congratulations, Alice.

12:06.083 --> 12:08.041
You have a very smart
web browser.

12:08.041 --> 12:09.333
Who theorized
that international

12:09.333 --> 12:10.708
trade was a zero sum game?

12:10.708 --> 12:12.708
Jean Baptiste Colbert.

12:12.708 --> 12:14.291
Okay, nobody likes
a show-off.

12:16.208 --> 12:18.417
[grunting]

12:18.417 --> 12:19.417
(Alice)
'Hey, Lewis.'

12:21.166 --> 12:23.375
- Unh!
- Oh.

12:23.375 --> 12:24.542
Sorry.

12:28.542 --> 12:31.250
I specifically told you
not to get involved.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.417
And not only do you ignore me,
now you drag her into it.

12:33.417 --> 12:35.917
Oh, get over yourself,
you big baby.

12:35.917 --> 12:37.917
- We know you're lying.
- What?

12:37.917 --> 12:39.583
I did my due diligence.

12:39.583 --> 12:41.083
You know what I discovered?

12:41.083 --> 12:43.625
The paper you bought
was on the topic of evolution.

12:43.625 --> 12:45.208
So?

12:45.208 --> 12:46.750
You weren't taking any Biology

12:46.750 --> 12:48.667
or-or Science History courses.

12:50.875 --> 12:53.083
You bought a paper
and never turned it in.

12:53.083 --> 12:53.917
It doesn't matter.

12:55.542 --> 12:58.208
I bought a paper
somebody else wrote.

12:58.208 --> 13:00.917
It violates the Lancer code
of conduct.

13:00.917 --> 13:04.041
Maybe, but lack of follow
through can exonerate you.

13:04.041 --> 13:05.458
It can get you probation.

13:05.458 --> 13:08.583
Look, I don't want
probation, okay?

13:08.583 --> 13:10.917
As my advocate,
I need you to listen to me.

13:10.917 --> 13:12.291
I am not mounting a defense.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.125
I am pleading guilty
and that's it.

13:14.125 --> 13:16.458
My case, my decision.

13:16.458 --> 13:17.834
End of discussion.

13:19.417 --> 13:22.000
Eddie, you ready
to get back to this?

13:22.000 --> 13:23.458
Yeah, let's go.

13:24.417 --> 13:27.333
[rock music]

13:29.667 --> 13:31.041
(Lewis)
Come on.

13:34.250 --> 13:35.792
Afternoon, Laverne.

13:37.291 --> 13:39.792
You know it's okay
to call me Phil.

13:39.792 --> 13:41.291
I hear my life is no small

13:41.291 --> 13:43.458
source of fascination to you.

13:43.458 --> 13:45.792
- I'm sorry?
- 'There is precedent.'

13:45.792 --> 13:47.458
The ancient Greeks
enjoyed acting out

13:47.458 --> 13:49.083
the foibles
of their immortal gods.

13:49.083 --> 13:50.708
'I see the attraction.'

13:50.708 --> 13:52.708
I do.

13:52.708 --> 13:54.083
But I figured I'd cut
to the chase

13:54.083 --> 13:55.333
and come talk to you
face to face.

13:55.333 --> 13:57.708
You know...like men.

14:00.125 --> 14:01.500
Next time you come
into this office

14:01.500 --> 14:02.875
I'd like you to knock first.

14:06.208 --> 14:09.125
Didn't mean to take
liberties, Laverne.

14:09.125 --> 14:12.375
'By the way, I love what you've
done with Bill's old digs.'

14:12.375 --> 14:14.250
I mean, who says
an athletic director's office

14:14.250 --> 14:17.583
needs to feel, uh...masculine.

14:18.625 --> 14:21.542
[instrumental music]

14:28.333 --> 14:29.708
Is that it?

14:38.542 --> 14:41.208
Are we going to be enemies now?

14:41.208 --> 14:42.875
I want you to tell me
why you've been asking

14:42.875 --> 14:44.834
about my personal history.

14:44.834 --> 14:46.166
'There's some rumor
going around'

14:46.166 --> 14:47.917
about me that
you'd like clarified?

14:53.291 --> 14:57.208
How was your relationship
with Emily Townsend?

14:57.208 --> 14:59.750
As good as it gets,
considering she's my ex-wife.

15:00.875 --> 15:02.333
Why?

15:02.333 --> 15:04.250
Jake Harrow's eleventh hour
confession

15:04.250 --> 15:05.917
and Bill Marsh's
abrupt resignation

15:05.917 --> 15:09.166
sent up a flag with the NCAA.

15:09.166 --> 15:10.583
The Trustees have hired someone

15:10.583 --> 15:12.375
to do opposition research.

15:12.375 --> 15:13.917
Who's the opposition?

15:13.917 --> 15:15.667
The NCAA.

15:15.667 --> 15:17.208
'If they start digging around'

15:17.208 --> 15:19.041
we want to know
what they're going to find

15:19.041 --> 15:20.375
before they find it.

15:22.125 --> 15:24.000
They have hired
one of the premier

15:24.000 --> 15:25.750
sports litigators in the state.

15:27.667 --> 15:29.417
A real pit bull.

15:31.583 --> 15:33.291
[scoffs]
God.

15:34.750 --> 15:36.708
She was the only name
on the short list.

15:40.083 --> 15:42.250
You let 'em hire
my ex-wife?

15:42.250 --> 15:45.583
Emily is driving down
from Nashville as we speak.

15:45.583 --> 15:48.125
'Now, I admit initially
I had some reservations'

15:48.125 --> 15:49.917
'as to whether or not
she could be trusted'

15:49.917 --> 15:52.458
to be impartial
where you were concerned.

15:52.458 --> 15:53.750
I didn't know you very well

15:53.750 --> 15:56.417
so that's why
I was asking around.

15:56.417 --> 15:57.959
But over the last few minutes

15:57.959 --> 16:00.458
I've got to know you
a little bit better...

16:00.458 --> 16:03.250
'...and I have come to realize
something significant.'

16:06.166 --> 16:08.250
I don't like you...

16:08.250 --> 16:10.583
...and I really don't care
if she buries you.

16:13.792 --> 16:16.750
[laughs]
Wow!

16:16.750 --> 16:18.250
You know something,
it feels really good

16:18.250 --> 16:20.625
to just come out
and say it like that.

16:20.625 --> 16:22.166
It feels...

16:24.291 --> 16:26.667
...dare I say, masculine?

16:32.792 --> 16:34.333
That'll be all, coach.

16:38.875 --> 16:40.417
Dismissed.

16:46.542 --> 16:49.500
♪ Where's the fun in that? ♪

16:51.000 --> 16:53.125
♪ Where's the fun in that? ♪

16:56.500 --> 16:59.083
You know, it's not good to work
and eat at the same time.

16:59.083 --> 17:02.041
So bad for your digestion.

17:02.041 --> 17:03.208
[chuckling]

17:06.333 --> 17:07.834
If I was worried
about my digestion

17:07.834 --> 17:09.791
I wouldn't be eating
that at all.

17:09.791 --> 17:13.375
So...how goes Lewis' defense?

17:13.375 --> 17:16.875
- Awful.
- Have you eaten?

17:16.875 --> 17:20.000
- Let me order you something.
- I'm not hungry.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.875
Um, the paper he bought,
he never used.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.375
That's encouraging.

17:24.375 --> 17:25.875
Yeah, despite that,
he's determined

17:25.875 --> 17:27.583
not to mount a defense.

17:27.583 --> 17:28.917
'He wants to plead guilty'

17:28.917 --> 17:30.542
and take his punishment,
which makes no sense

17:30.542 --> 17:31.708
since apparently
he's done nothing

17:31.708 --> 17:33.500
worth getting punished over.

17:33.500 --> 17:34.834
You know, I once had a client

17:34.834 --> 17:37.041
I was defending for robbery.

17:37.041 --> 17:39.542
'He confessed,
but I knew he was lying.'

17:39.542 --> 17:41.667
Turned out he was protecting
his son

17:41.667 --> 17:43.750
who actually committed
the crime.

17:43.750 --> 17:45.375
And?

17:45.375 --> 17:46.583
The father pleaded guilty

17:46.583 --> 17:47.750
and he went to jail.

17:47.750 --> 17:49.542
And you let it happen?

17:49.542 --> 17:51.542
[chuckles]
You know, you seem
to have this notion

17:51.542 --> 17:53.375
that our job
is to deliver justice.

17:53.375 --> 17:56.208
That's not what it means
to be a lawyer.

17:56.208 --> 17:57.542
'Your job is to do the best'

17:57.542 --> 17:59.208
'you can to advocate
for your client'

17:59.208 --> 18:00.917
but at the end of the day,
decisions

18:00.917 --> 18:02.208
are theirs to make.

18:02.208 --> 18:03.291
It's hard to imagine Lewis

18:03.291 --> 18:04.875
covering up for someone.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.875
Well, it is but one theory.

18:11.083 --> 18:13.625
If I was a social scientist

18:13.625 --> 18:15.375
instead of a lawyer,
there's one thing

18:15.375 --> 18:16.959
I'd like to research.

18:16.959 --> 18:19.125
Yeah, what's that?

18:20.583 --> 18:21.917
Why women will tell you

18:21.917 --> 18:23.583
that they're not hungry
and then proceed

18:23.583 --> 18:25.291
to eat right off your plate.

18:26.583 --> 18:29.417
Sorry, I-I usually
never do that.

18:29.417 --> 18:30.708
'Well, except for Dan'

18:30.708 --> 18:32.458
and the occasional boyfriend.

18:36.083 --> 18:38.583
[chuckles]
We need some ketchup.

18:38.583 --> 18:40.375
I'll go get some.

18:47.583 --> 18:50.000
[cheering]

18:51.959 --> 18:53.625
Alright, thank you.

18:53.625 --> 18:56.125
Wow. Thank you.

18:56.125 --> 18:57.458
Looks like the room is full.

18:57.458 --> 18:59.458
It must be time
for the main event.

18:59.458 --> 19:00.750
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my pleasure

19:00.750 --> 19:02.792
to introduce to you our honorary

19:02.792 --> 19:05.333

Olympic all-around

19:05.333 --> 19:07.083

19:15.625 --> 19:17.125
Hello, everyone, and welcome

19:17.125 --> 19:20.125
to the St. John's Breast Cancer
Center annual gala.

19:20.125 --> 19:22.583
You guys are here
for a great cause.

19:22.583 --> 19:24.333
[cheering]

19:26.000 --> 19:28.458
But let's be honest,
you didn't pay to hear me talk

19:28.458 --> 19:30.750
and I can't really walk
on the balance beam

19:30.750 --> 19:32.125
in these four inch heels.

19:32.125 --> 19:34.000
You guys came to see
a show, right?

19:34.000 --> 19:35.959

21:46.458 --> 21:48.083
That was exhilarating.

21:48.083 --> 21:49.417
We rocked the hell
out of that one.

21:50.834 --> 21:52.500
It's done, okay?

21:52.500 --> 21:54.250
(Lewis)
'The discussion
is over, okay? No.'

21:54.250 --> 21:56.583
- You have to tell the truth.
- We are done with this.

21:59.291 --> 22:01.041
That's the second time I've seen
the two of them arguing.

22:01.041 --> 22:03.458
Do you think she
knows something?

22:03.458 --> 22:06.458
Julian thought maybe Lewis
was protecting someone else.

22:06.458 --> 22:08.417
Her? No way.

22:08.417 --> 22:09.792
She'd never cheat.

22:09.792 --> 22:11.375
I would have said
the same about Lewis.

22:12.834 --> 22:14.208
You're alright?

22:14.208 --> 22:17.083
- It was a paper on evolution.
- So?

22:17.083 --> 22:19.458
Two years ago, Savannah was
a homeschooled Evangelical

22:19.458 --> 22:21.834
who was probably taught
that evolution was a myth

22:21.834 --> 22:24.458
perpetuated by Satanists
who sucked the blood of

22:24.458 --> 22:26.125
un-baptized Christian babies.

22:26.125 --> 22:28.166
I don't think they teach it
quite that way.

22:28.166 --> 22:30.375
I said probably.

22:30.375 --> 22:32.000
The truth is, that Lewis
never would have made it

22:32.000 --> 22:35.333
'on the squad if Savannah
hadn't saved his ass.'

22:35.333 --> 22:37.834
He owed her...big time.

22:37.834 --> 22:39.583
Big enough to cheat?

22:43.500 --> 22:45.458
- Let's find out.
- Whoa, what are you doing?

22:45.458 --> 22:48.000
- Alice!
- Hey, Savannah.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.792
Are you a big disgusting
liar or what?

22:49.792 --> 22:52.333
- I'm sorry?
- Alice, whoa. This is way out--

22:52.333 --> 22:54.125
- What did you just say?
- Oh, hell. This is not--

22:54.125 --> 22:56.041
- No, really. You heard me.
- 'Alice.'

22:56.041 --> 22:57.417
Because if you're
actually letting Lewis

22:57.417 --> 22:59.208
take the fall for something
that you did...

22:59.208 --> 23:01.208
No, no, no. You are way out of
line right now. Alice!

23:01.208 --> 23:03.208
It's unworthy of you and
it's unworthy of the squad.

23:03.208 --> 23:04.542
Alice.

23:08.708 --> 23:10.667
Nothing to say?

23:15.208 --> 23:17.125
I guess that says it all.

23:18.542 --> 23:21.500
[Savannah sobbing]

23:24.583 --> 23:26.834
I'm sorry.

23:26.834 --> 23:28.959
I'm so sorry.

23:28.959 --> 23:31.500
I feel like the worst person
in the world.

23:33.542 --> 23:35.083
Hey.

23:35.083 --> 23:36.417
Breathe, breathe.
It's important to breathe.

23:36.417 --> 23:37.542
It's okay. It's okay.

23:37.542 --> 23:39.125
'It's okay.'

23:39.125 --> 23:40.583
'Breathe.
It's important to breathe.'

23:40.583 --> 23:41.959
- It's alright.
- We should...

23:43.375 --> 23:45.083
We should take this elsewhere.

23:45.083 --> 23:46.417
[crying]

23:46.417 --> 23:47.959
Come on.

23:51.250 --> 23:53.500
It was my first time
at a secular school.

23:54.917 --> 23:57.750
I was a nervous wreck.

23:57.750 --> 24:00.875
Everything was so strange
and alien

24:00.875 --> 24:05.083
and then I get to a class where
everyone understood evolution.

24:05.083 --> 24:06.750
'I had trouble wrapping
my head around'

24:06.750 --> 24:09.500
everyone assuming
it was just scientific fact.

24:11.750 --> 24:12.917
And then the Professor

24:12.917 --> 24:14.875
made fun of me
in front of everybody...

24:16.417 --> 24:19.083
And I don't know.

24:19.083 --> 24:22.041
Got stubborn, angry...

24:23.458 --> 24:25.959
I let myself get mental.

24:25.959 --> 24:28.125
'It was stupid.'

24:28.125 --> 24:30.250
Especially knowing
how high the stakes were.

24:31.417 --> 24:33.250
'So, there I was...'

24:33.250 --> 24:36.166
...refusing to write the paper
that was due the next morning.

24:37.792 --> 24:39.708
And then Lewis yelled at me.

24:39.708 --> 24:41.458
You yelled?

24:41.458 --> 24:42.458
Yeah, I was pissed.

24:42.458 --> 24:44.166
Come on, Savannah.

24:44.166 --> 24:45.875
She'd just given up
so much to come here

24:45.875 --> 24:47.625
and then
she just-just checked out.

24:47.625 --> 24:49.291
Wake up!

24:49.291 --> 24:51.250
I just reminded her that
flunking out of Lancer

24:51.250 --> 24:53.333
meant going back home with
her tail between her legs.

24:54.625 --> 24:57.959
You can't just
give up, Savannah.

24:57.959 --> 24:59.834
We need you.

24:59.834 --> 25:01.083
There's nothing I can do.

25:01.083 --> 25:02.333
Well, let me help you.

25:02.333 --> 25:03.500
I-I can help you.

25:03.500 --> 25:04.792
'I can.'

25:04.792 --> 25:06.375
How?

25:06.375 --> 25:09.000
So then Lewis offered
to help me write the paper.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.583
I didn't know
much about evolution so...

25:13.125 --> 25:15.959
That's where Betsy came in.

25:15.959 --> 25:18.000
You know what to do if
you get caught, right?

25:18.000 --> 25:19.458
Forget your name.

25:19.458 --> 25:21.375
Pleasure doing business
with you.

25:26.125 --> 25:28.834
(Lewis)
So, I bought a paper
from Betsy.

25:28.834 --> 25:31.834
My intention was to only
use it as a reference.

25:31.834 --> 25:33.250
(Savannah)
When I realized
what you'd done

25:33.250 --> 25:35.125
I didn't know what to think.

25:35.125 --> 25:36.500
We should have
burned the thing.

25:36.500 --> 25:39.083
We'll use that as a guideline.

25:39.083 --> 25:41.375
(Savannah)
But we agreed that we'd never
copy directly off the paper

25:41.375 --> 25:45.750
and...we convinced ourselves
it was okay.

25:45.750 --> 25:47.834
(Lewis)
'And it just, uh,
it was just getting'

25:47.834 --> 25:50.250
later and later
and...we were getting

25:50.250 --> 25:52.125
exhausted and...

25:52.125 --> 25:55.041
[keyboard clacking]

26:03.291 --> 26:06.208
[dramatic music]

26:17.208 --> 26:21.208
So I used it...or
a lot of it at least.

26:21.208 --> 26:23.375
Okay, I get all that,
but what don't understand

26:23.375 --> 26:25.375
is why Lewis is so dead set
on taking the fall alone.

26:25.375 --> 26:27.166
(Dan)
'Come on, M.'

26:27.166 --> 26:29.375
If he tells the honor court
he never turned in the paper

26:29.375 --> 26:32.333
they're gonna to ask the
same questions you guys did.

26:32.333 --> 26:33.875
They're gonna ask who did.

26:40.750 --> 26:42.583
I created the
opportunity, alright?

26:42.583 --> 26:44.375
It never even would have
occurred to Savannah to cheat

26:44.375 --> 26:46.583
if I hadn't bought that paper
and that's on me.

26:46.583 --> 26:49.750
Plus...when you're caught
cheating

26:49.750 --> 26:50.959
you either get suspended
or you get an "F"

26:50.959 --> 26:53.291
in the class, right?

26:53.291 --> 26:56.083
Well, if I'm suspended,
the Hellcats, they lose a base

26:56.083 --> 26:58.375
'a few weeks before Nationals
and that would be bad'

26:58.375 --> 27:00.917
'but it wouldn't be a disaster.'

27:00.917 --> 27:04.250
Now, if Savannah gets suspended,
we not only lose

27:04.250 --> 27:08.291
our-our best flyer,
we lose our captain.

27:08.291 --> 27:09.625
That will be a disaster.

27:09.625 --> 27:11.000
Best flyer?

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
Hardly.

27:16.792 --> 27:21.166
Bottom-line, no one here is
going to rat you out, okay?

27:22.458 --> 27:24.834
I assume that's true, Alice?

27:26.792 --> 27:28.083
Mm-hmm.

27:28.083 --> 27:31.291
(Marti)
'So, the question is...'

27:31.291 --> 27:32.875
...what do you want to do next?

27:35.083 --> 27:38.000
[dramatic music]

27:42.000 --> 27:44.375
I'm gonna to do what I should
have done in the first place.

27:45.417 --> 27:46.750
I'm gonna come clean.

27:46.750 --> 27:49.125
Savannah, that's not
a good idea. The team...

27:49.125 --> 27:50.959
Has been through worse.

27:50.959 --> 27:53.458
Listen, I have to face
the mistakes I've made

27:53.458 --> 27:55.500
and live with the consequences.

27:55.500 --> 27:58.500
I can't just pretend like
the past is gonna to go away.

27:58.500 --> 28:00.458
'I can't live my life
that way.'

28:03.333 --> 28:06.291
Listen...

28:06.291 --> 28:09.125
...I know you think
you're responsible...

28:09.125 --> 28:10.417
...but it's not your fault.

28:12.125 --> 28:13.875
It was my name on the paper...

28:14.834 --> 28:16.750
My responsibility.

28:19.041 --> 28:20.834
Thank you.

28:24.708 --> 28:26.667
Marti, will you defend me?

28:28.667 --> 28:30.542
Of course.

28:30.542 --> 28:31.750
Thanks.

28:35.208 --> 28:38.125
I'm going to go e-mail the Dean,
tell him the truth.

- That was fierce.

28:48.208 --> 28:49.542
It was fun, right?

28:49.542 --> 28:51.500
Vanessa, we need to talk.

28:55.208 --> 28:57.542
- We have a problem.
- What's the problem?

28:57.542 --> 28:59.041
Um...

28:59.041 --> 29:00.375
[gasps]

29:00.375 --> 29:02.500
Man, I think,
Emily just walked in.

29:04.250 --> 29:05.875
Yeah, that'd be the problem.

29:05.875 --> 29:08.041
[sighs]

29:08.041 --> 29:12.291
So, you obviously knew Lewis was
taking the fall for Savannah.

29:12.291 --> 29:15.750
Look, after we heard her arguing
with Lewis, I asked her.

29:15.750 --> 29:17.583
She swore me to secrecy.

29:17.583 --> 29:19.125
I'm sorry, I couldn't tell you.

29:20.083 --> 29:21.959
I'm your best friend.

29:21.959 --> 29:23.667
And she's my girlfriend.

29:25.959 --> 29:28.125
Look, when I came back
from New Orleans

29:28.125 --> 29:31.583
we both agreed our relationship
had to be different.

29:31.583 --> 29:33.500
So we don't make
the same mistakes.

29:35.250 --> 29:37.625
So, now it's different.

29:44.583 --> 29:47.291
That-That's probably
a good thing, huh?

29:47.291 --> 29:49.834
(Dan)
'Yeah, I think so.'

29:49.834 --> 29:51.583
'Hey, you want anything snacky?'

29:53.250 --> 29:55.875
No. I'm...not hungry.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.959
They hired her?

30:00.959 --> 30:03.125
She was on the legal staff
for the NCAA

30:03.125 --> 30:04.625
but she left to freelance.

30:04.625 --> 30:05.834
There are no shortage of schools

30:05.834 --> 30:08.291
needing her kind
of inside information.

30:08.291 --> 30:10.291
But she works for us, right?

30:10.291 --> 30:11.625
On our side?

30:11.625 --> 30:13.000
She works for the school.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.959
And the school
is on the school's side.

30:14.959 --> 30:16.792
Well, we bent a lot of rules

30:16.792 --> 30:18.959
trying to get Travis
out of prison.

30:18.959 --> 30:20.667
We did more than bend rules.

30:20.667 --> 30:22.417
[exhales]
Well, it's in the past.

30:22.417 --> 30:25.625
I'm sure Emily's moved on
and we should do the same.

30:25.625 --> 30:28.417
Let's just go to her before she
comes to us because...

30:28.417 --> 30:29.542
Red?

30:30.458 --> 30:32.000
Emily, hi.

30:34.166 --> 30:35.625
Hey, Emily.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.959
And Vanessa the cheerleader.

30:37.959 --> 30:40.667
I hear you're coaching
the Hellcats now.

30:40.667 --> 30:42.333
Yes, I am.

30:42.333 --> 30:44.250
'Uh, we go to Nationals
in a couple of weeks.'

30:44.250 --> 30:45.667
Oh, that's fantastic.

30:45.667 --> 30:47.583
I always knew
you had a bright future.

30:50.834 --> 30:52.542
So, you two are together?

30:52.542 --> 30:53.625
- What? No.
- No, no.

30:53.625 --> 30:54.959
We're just friends.

30:54.959 --> 30:58.625
Oh, um, not according
to the report.

30:58.625 --> 31:00.291
Report?

31:00.291 --> 31:02.000
Uh, from the
private investigator.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.208
I've been having members of
the coaching staff followed.

31:04.208 --> 31:05.834
[scoffs]

31:05.834 --> 31:06.875
[chuckles]

31:06.875 --> 31:08.000
God.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.500
Look at the two of you.

31:09.500 --> 31:10.667
You're like
a couple of teenagers

31:10.667 --> 31:12.583
caught groping in the basement.

31:13.667 --> 31:15.500
I'm kidding.

31:15.500 --> 31:16.583
[chuckling]

31:16.583 --> 31:18.417
Oh.

31:18.417 --> 31:20.208
Probably.

31:22.875 --> 31:24.000
Guys, there's no reason
to be awkward.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.083
It was ten years ago.

31:25.083 --> 31:26.917
It's...water under the bridge.

31:26.917 --> 31:28.000
Whoosh.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.708
[laughing]

31:29.708 --> 31:33.834
Well, in that case,
yes, we are together.

31:38.542 --> 31:40.708
That's wonderful.

31:40.708 --> 31:43.250
I hope he makes you every bit
as happy as he made me.

31:48.875 --> 31:50.875
That woman wants us dead.

31:50.875 --> 31:52.792
You picked up
on that, did ya?

31:56.708 --> 31:59.875
Do you understand the charges
against you, Miss Monroe?

31:59.875 --> 32:01.125
Yes, Your Honor.

32:01.125 --> 32:02.917
And you understand
the range of punishments

32:02.917 --> 32:05.458
we will be deciding on
if you plead guilty?

32:05.458 --> 32:07.083
Yes, Your Honor.

32:07.083 --> 32:08.458
And how do you plead?

32:10.375 --> 32:12.375
Guilty.

32:12.375 --> 32:14.417
Would counsel like to say
anything before we decide

32:14.417 --> 32:16.917
which punishment
is more appropriate?

32:16.917 --> 32:19.041
Yes, Your Honors, I would.

32:19.041 --> 32:20.375
Miss Perkins?

32:27.458 --> 32:29.667
Positive outcomes only.

32:29.667 --> 32:32.708
That's Savannah Monroe's mantra.

32:32.708 --> 32:35.583
She sees the positive
in everything.

32:35.583 --> 32:37.333
In everyone.

32:37.333 --> 32:40.250
It starts off annoying but
quickly becomes contagious.

32:40.250 --> 32:42.625
You stand next to this woman,
you can't help being

32:42.625 --> 32:45.959
affected by her hope,
her optimism, her wild

32:45.959 --> 32:48.083
enthusiasm for what comes next.

32:50.125 --> 32:55.250
Doubt is...everywhere today.

32:55.250 --> 32:58.125
Doubt becomes cynicism,
which influences what we do

32:58.125 --> 33:00.959
how we feel about each other
and ourselves.

33:00.959 --> 33:04.083
It colors our interactions,
but not Savannah's.

33:06.500 --> 33:09.583
A few months ago
I lost my scholarship.

33:09.583 --> 33:12.125
I almost had to give up
my dream of being a lawyer.

33:13.250 --> 33:15.583
I was desperate.

33:15.583 --> 33:17.000
I lashed out.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.792
'I insulted her world view.'

33:18.792 --> 33:21.792
I ended up calling her names
like "football groupie"

33:21.792 --> 33:24.125
and "bobblehead."

33:24.125 --> 33:25.792
[chuckles]

33:25.792 --> 33:27.250
'I gave her good reason
to write me off'

33:27.250 --> 33:29.166
'but she didn't do that.'

33:29.166 --> 33:30.708
She forgave me.

33:32.333 --> 33:35.667
She embraced me as a friend
and as a teammate.

33:35.667 --> 33:38.000
And in the process...

33:40.959 --> 33:42.583
...she saved my life.

33:44.291 --> 33:47.000
'She saved my dream
of becoming a lawyer one day.'

33:47.000 --> 33:49.667
Well, God and
the Tennessee State Bar willing.

33:49.667 --> 33:50.834
[people laughing]

33:50.834 --> 33:52.333
[Marti sighs]

33:52.333 --> 33:54.250
I haven't always been
the best friend to her.

33:55.333 --> 33:58.667
'I've done things I regret.'

33:58.667 --> 34:02.792
'But Savannah believes that
every tomorrow is better'

34:02.792 --> 34:04.750
'than today and...'

34:06.208 --> 34:08.208
Every day we all become
a little better

34:08.208 --> 34:09.958
than the day before.

34:17.625 --> 34:21.750
Savannah inspires me to live up
to that expectation.

34:22.875 --> 34:26.667
'And I'm not the only one.'

34:26.667 --> 34:29.917
For a lot of people,
people in this room

34:29.917 --> 34:31.875
she is our compass.

34:34.125 --> 34:38.750
Your Honors...Savannah Monroe
deserves to be punished.

34:38.750 --> 34:40.708
On that we can all agree.

34:40.708 --> 34:43.708
'I'm simply asking that while
you're making your decision'

34:43.708 --> 34:45.917
'you see the world as she does.'

34:45.917 --> 34:48.250
Allow her to continue
at this university.

34:48.250 --> 34:50.208
Allow her to keep
making the world

34:50.208 --> 34:52.542
around her
incrementally better.

34:54.375 --> 34:58.125
Let positive outcomes only
guide your sentencing.

35:02.208 --> 35:03.542
Thank you.

35:06.750 --> 35:08.417
Thank you, Miss Perkins.

35:08.417 --> 35:10.333
You'll have our answer shortly.

35:14.667 --> 35:15.792
[door opens]

35:21.708 --> 35:24.417
Hey, aren't you lucky
you got off easy?

35:24.417 --> 35:26.083
Academic probation.

35:26.083 --> 35:27.708
If it were up to me right now,
I'd be the one standing

35:27.708 --> 35:29.125
up there, not Savannah.

35:29.125 --> 35:31.125
Oh, Lewis, when are
you going to stop

35:31.125 --> 35:33.458
being the martyr all the time?

35:33.458 --> 35:35.583
Martyrs aren't sexy.

35:35.583 --> 35:38.542
Unless you're Milla Jovovich
and Joan of Arc.

35:38.542 --> 35:41.458
Mm. I would not kick her
out of bed.

35:41.458 --> 35:43.125
[laughing]

35:43.125 --> 35:44.458
Yeah, I got better things
to do than to try

35:44.458 --> 35:45.667
to make you think I'm sexy.

35:45.667 --> 35:48.583
Well, you used to do it
without trying.

35:48.583 --> 35:51.500
- Occasionally still do.
- Only occasionally?

35:51.500 --> 35:54.041
[chuckles]
I learned my lesson.

35:54.041 --> 35:55.625
Hah, please.

35:55.625 --> 35:57.625
Ain't nobody teach you anything?

35:57.625 --> 35:59.291
Probably not.

35:59.291 --> 36:01.291
But isn't it fun to try?

36:01.291 --> 36:03.291
[laughs]

36:03.291 --> 36:05.041
Occasionally.

36:06.083 --> 36:08.250
[laughing]

36:08.250 --> 36:10.041
- Oh, you know, I was...
- I always wondered.

36:12.834 --> 36:14.625
Go ahead.

36:14.625 --> 36:15.917
No, you.

36:18.625 --> 36:20.834
[door opens]

36:20.834 --> 36:22.667
'The verdict's in.'

36:22.667 --> 36:24.041
That didn't take long.

36:24.041 --> 36:25.166
(Alice)
'Maybe that's a good sign?'

36:25.166 --> 36:26.875
(Lewis)
'Yeah, or bad.'

36:26.875 --> 36:28.458
I'm gonna to go get
Marti and Savannah.

36:41.458 --> 36:44.041
Thank you for your patience.

36:44.041 --> 36:47.000
(female judge#1)
'We have reached a consensus.'

36:47.000 --> 36:49.750
Miss Monroe violated what is
perhaps the most important

36:49.750 --> 36:53.000
part of the student honor code,
the trust that exists

36:53.000 --> 36:56.458
between an academic institution
and it's students.

36:56.458 --> 37:00.000
'Failure is a vital part
of our educational system.'

37:00.000 --> 37:03.500
It is why we must
punish Miss Monroe.

37:03.500 --> 37:07.375
However, our justice system
exists to reform.

37:07.375 --> 37:09.333
And given Miss Monroe's
significant contribution

37:09.333 --> 37:12.708
to the Lancer community,
as well as the circumstances

37:12.708 --> 37:16.041
'under which she violated
the student honor code...'

37:16.041 --> 37:17.667
...we have concluded that
she is to be given

37:17.667 --> 37:19.375
a failing grade in the class.

37:19.375 --> 37:20.542
[sighs]

37:20.542 --> 37:21.667
'Court adjourned.'

37:21.667 --> 37:23.041
[indistinct chatter]

37:23.041 --> 37:24.917
Right, we pulled it off.

37:24.917 --> 37:26.375
Alright.

37:26.375 --> 37:27.834
I've never been so happy
to fail in my life.

37:27.834 --> 37:30.208
- Thank you, Marti.
- You're welcome. Wow.

37:30.208 --> 37:32.166
I will see you all at Nationals.

37:32.166 --> 37:33.333
Copy that.

37:33.333 --> 37:35.417
Who's up for drinks? Huh?

37:35.417 --> 37:37.125
- Alice is buying.
- You wish.

37:37.125 --> 37:38.542
(Dan)
'An amazing job, M.'

37:38.542 --> 37:41.250
Next time I go on
a demented killing spree

37:41.250 --> 37:43.375
- I want you representing me.
- Yeah, you got it.

37:43.375 --> 37:44.417
I'm proud of you, kiddo.

37:44.417 --> 37:45.750
- Thanks.
- Good job.
