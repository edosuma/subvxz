[Mary] <i>My name is
Mary Katherine Blackwood.</i>

01:23.996 --> 01:25.494
<i>I am 18 years old,</i>

01:25.496 --> 01:27.830
<i>and I live with my sister,
Constance.</i>

<i>She is the most precious person
in the world.</i>

01:37.729 --> 01:40.729
<i>The Blackwoods have always
lived in this house.</i>

01:42.629 --> 01:45.563
<i>We have never done anything
to hurt anyone.</i>

01:47.462 --> 01:49.829
<i>We put things back
where they belong.</i>

01:50.829 --> 01:53.259
<i>And we will never leave here.</i>

01:53.261 --> 01:55.593
<i>No matter what they say...</i>

01:55.595 --> 01:58.993
<i>or what they do to us.</i>

01:58.995 --> 02:00.228
<i>Never.</i>

02:04.163 --> 02:06.660
<i>But a change is coming.</i>

02:06.662 --> 02:11.960

02:56.661 --> 03:00.660

03:00.662 --> 03:02.992
<i>Now they believe it,</i>

03:02.994 --> 03:07.859
<i>and with all whet me to be
revenged on Rivers, Dorset, Grey.</i>

03:07.861 --> 03:12.026
<i>But then I sigh,
and, with a piece of scripture,</i>

03:12.028 --> 03:15.492

do good for evil.</i>

- <i>when most I play the devil.</i>
- Merricat, come on!

03:36.561 --> 03:38.961
[Constance] Please,
wash your hands.

03:46.493 --> 03:48.392
What are you reading?

03:48.394 --> 03:50.624
A pretty sight,
a lady with a book.

03:50.626 --> 03:54.492
I'm reading something called <i>The Best
Practice Guide to Canning,</i> Uncle Julian.

03:54.494 --> 03:55.758
[Julian] Admirable.

03:55.760 --> 03:57.826
I don't seem to have
any information

03:57.828 --> 04:00.826
on whether your father
took

04:00.828 --> 04:03.058
- his cigar in the garden that morning.
- He did.

04:03.060 --> 04:06.224
- He always did in the morning.
- I should begin the chapter with that.

04:06.226 --> 04:08.324
"I won't have it."

04:08.326 --> 04:10.126
I heard your mother say that.

04:10.128 --> 04:12.726
Your father said,

04:12.728 --> 04:16.491
"We have no choice.
I mean it." End quote.

04:16.493 --> 04:19.757
- Here's the list.
- Mr. Elbert doesn't like big bills.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.624
- All right now.
- The coins are better.

04:21.625 --> 04:23.524
You'll go to the town.

04:23.526 --> 04:25.558
You'll check out
our books and records.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.257
You'll buy our groceries

04:27.259 --> 04:30.593
- and you'll be back in time for lunch.
- Do I have to...?

04:34.326 --> 04:36.226
Lock the door.

[Mary] <i>Tuesday is

04:42.860 --> 04:45.891
<i>Because Tuesday
I must go to town</i>

04:45.893 --> 04:49.623
<i>and see all of those
who hate us.</i>

04:49.625 --> 04:51.458
<i>I read in my book of spells</i>

04:51.460 --> 04:55.125
<i>that if you bury something evil
or touched by cruelty</i>

04:55.127 --> 04:56.691
<i>you may take its power</i>

04:56.693 --> 04:59.191
<i>and you cannot be harmed
for one whole day.</i>

[speaks spell softly]

05:01.393 --> 05:04.457

05:04.459 --> 05:07.058
<i>We live at the end
of Blackwood Road,</i>

05:07.060 --> 05:09.791
<i>which runs in a great circle
around the village.</i>

05:09.793 --> 05:13.423
<i>Father, like all
the Blackwoods before him,</i>

05:13.425 --> 05:15.091
<i>was very rich.</i>

05:15.093 --> 05:18.091
<i>And he built this gate
to keep us safe.</i>

05:18.093 --> 05:20.992
<i>But it could not protect him.</i>

05:26.059 --> 05:27.958
<i>People here believe</i>

05:27.960 --> 05:31.590
<i>that six years ago Constance
killed Father and our family</i>

05:31.592 --> 05:33.590
<i>and poisoned Uncle Julian.</i>

05:33.592 --> 05:37.423
<i>They think she is wicked
and should be sent away.</i>

05:37.425 --> 05:41.724
<i>But now we live as two queens in a
castle on top of the highest hill.</i>

05:41.726 --> 05:43.292
You eat rats!

05:45.759 --> 05:47.957
[chattering]

05:47.959 --> 05:50.625
<i>They wish for our ruin.</i>

05:51.759 --> 05:53.957
<i>But they don't understand.</i>

05:53.959 --> 05:56.258
- [item thuds]
- [man] A rack of lamb.

05:58.325 --> 05:59.625
Eggs.

06:01.225 --> 06:03.290
Coffee.

06:03.292 --> 06:05.559
Flour.

06:06.525 --> 06:08.456
- Walnuts.
- Thomas.

06:08.458 --> 06:10.689
Peanut brittle.

06:10.691 --> 06:12.392
Thomas, stop it!

06:14.291 --> 06:16.325
Anything else?

06:22.958 --> 06:24.992
[bell tolls]

06:41.591 --> 06:43.355
Good morning, Merricat.

06:43.357 --> 06:44.689
How are you today?

06:44.691 --> 06:45.789
Fine, thank you.

06:45.791 --> 06:48.691
- Black coffee, please.
- Sure.

06:49.925 --> 06:50.956
[doorbell jingles]

06:50.958 --> 06:52.589
[man] Hey, Stella!

06:52.591 --> 06:54.422
[Stella] Gentlemen.

06:54.424 --> 06:56.589
- [Mary] <i>As soon as I heard his voice...</i>
- Where's the fire?

06:56.591 --> 06:58.255
Yeah, it's practice drills
this morning, ladies.

06:58.257 --> 07:01.222
<i>...I knew my spell of
protection had been broken.</i>

07:01.224 --> 07:03.056
Lady.

07:03.058 --> 07:08.289
<i>Long ago, Jim Donnell fell in
love with my sister, Constance.</i>

07:08.291 --> 07:12.891
<i>He wanted to steal her away
from us in his automobile.</i>

07:14.624 --> 07:16.621
<i>But I told Father.</i>

07:16.623 --> 07:19.123
So...

07:19.125 --> 07:21.691
<i>And Father was powerful</i>

07:22.857 --> 07:25.321
...they tell me
you're moving away.

07:25.323 --> 07:28.822
<i>...so Jim Donnell
lost his job</i>

07:28.824 --> 07:30.391
<i>and his love.</i>

07:31.657 --> 07:33.289
<i>And then his automobile.</i>

07:33.291 --> 07:35.089
They tell me

07:35.091 --> 07:37.523
you're moving away.

07:38.890 --> 07:40.688
No.

07:40.690 --> 07:42.989
No?

07:42.991 --> 07:46.722
Must've just been gossip.

07:46.724 --> 07:48.889
Did you ever hear anything like
the gossip in this town, Stella?

07:48.891 --> 07:50.755
Leave her alone, Jim.

07:50.757 --> 07:53.588
I'm not bothering anybody,
Stell.

07:53.590 --> 07:57.788
I'm just asking Miss Mary
Katherine Blackwood here

07:57.790 --> 08:01.122
how it is that
everybody in town

08:01.124 --> 08:02.588
is telling me
her and her sister

08:02.590 --> 08:05.155
are going somewhere
else to live.

08:05.157 --> 08:07.255
Hmm?

08:10.857 --> 08:12.557
Yeah.

08:14.623 --> 08:18.122
It's a pity
when the old families go.

08:18.124 --> 08:20.256
Though I guess
you could say...

08:21.724 --> 08:26.387
most of the Blackwoods
are gone already.

08:26.389 --> 08:31.620
Well, I can always tell people that, you know, I
knew Constance Blackwood. I knew her real well.

08:31.622 --> 08:33.388
Did they ever do
anything to you, Bobby?

08:33.390 --> 08:35.520
I could tell people,
I fixed their broken step

08:35.522 --> 08:36.922
once and never
got paid for it.

08:36.924 --> 08:39.888
Well, that must've been
an oversight, Bobby.

08:39.890 --> 08:42.354
I tell you what,
now that John Blackwood's gone,

08:42.356 --> 08:44.687
you can march right through
the gate and see her.

08:44.689 --> 08:46.353
[laughs]

08:46.355 --> 08:48.054
She'll see you get
what's coming to you.

08:48.056 --> 08:50.287
[whispers] Didn't fix it.

08:50.289 --> 08:53.587
Excuse me?

08:53.589 --> 08:57.289
Father said shoddy work should
be punished, not paid for.

08:59.856 --> 09:01.989
Is that so?

09:07.023 --> 09:09.255
[bell tolls]

09:11.856 --> 09:14.422
[Jim] Go away.

09:18.889 --> 09:20.754
Maybe you should
run along home now.

09:20.756 --> 09:22.419
They'll be no peace
around here till you do.

09:22.421 --> 09:24.088
[Bobby] You got that right.

09:24.090 --> 09:26.954
Now, you just say the word,
Ms. Mary Katherine Blackwood,

09:26.956 --> 09:29.854
and we'll come up there
and we'll help you pack.

09:29.856 --> 09:31.853
Free of charge!

09:31.855 --> 09:33.954
[tolling continues]

09:33.956 --> 09:36.589
[eerie music]

09:42.823 --> 09:44.286
Merricat.

09:44.288 --> 09:45.921
Merricat.

09:45.923 --> 09:48.654
[young boy] Where's old Connie,
home cooking dinner?

09:48.656 --> 09:51.287
"Merricat," said Connie,
"would you like a cup of tea?"

09:51.289 --> 09:53.586
[younger boy] "Oh no," said
Merricat, "you'll poison me."

09:53.588 --> 09:56.686
[older boy] "Merricat," said Connie,
"would you like to go to sleep?

09:56.688 --> 09:59.187
Down in the boneyard
ten feet deep!"

09:59.189 --> 10:00.821
- Kids!
- [older boy] Bye, stupid!

10:00.823 --> 10:03.486
My mom says you
and Constance eat rats.

10:03.488 --> 10:05.221
Go home, you witch!

10:21.388 --> 10:24.488
[panting]

10:36.922 --> 10:38.855
[Constance] Merricat.

10:41.521 --> 10:45.087
Look how far I came today.

10:45.089 --> 10:49.685
Next thing you know,
I'll be following you into town.

10:49.687 --> 10:52.487
You wouldn't like it
very much.

11:25.787 --> 11:27.554
Tonight,

11:29.620 --> 11:36.518
I believe I will
commence Chapter 44.

11:36.520 --> 11:43.484
I will begin with
a slight exaggeration

11:43.486 --> 11:46.085
and from there
go on into

11:46.087 --> 11:50.552
an outright... lie.

11:50.554 --> 11:52.818
Constance, my dear?

11:52.820 --> 11:54.385
Yes, Uncle Julian?

11:54.387 --> 11:57.885
I am going to say
that my wife

11:57.887 --> 12:00.654
was beautiful.

12:02.319 --> 12:05.586
[gentle music]

12:07.720 --> 12:11.986
I'm always happy when you
come home from the village.

12:13.053 --> 12:15.787
Yes, you bring me food...

12:17.419 --> 12:19.753
but also I miss you.

12:20.720 --> 12:24.286
I'm always happy to get back.

12:28.120 --> 12:31.319
How was it in town today?

12:35.453 --> 12:37.084
I'm getting better.

12:37.086 --> 12:40.918
I went so far
down the lawn today.

12:40.920 --> 12:42.684
Someday I'll go.

12:42.686 --> 12:44.918
I'll take you to the moon.

12:44.920 --> 12:46.552
It's beautiful there.

12:53.753 --> 12:56.151
We will be picking
lettuces soon.

12:56.153 --> 13:00.584
The weather
has stayed so warm.

13:00.586 --> 13:05.818
On the moon, you have lettuce
all year round, yes?

13:05.820 --> 13:09.018
On the moon
we have everything.

13:09.020 --> 13:12.517
The locks are solid
and tight.

13:12.519 --> 13:14.616
It's just you and me.

13:14.618 --> 13:18.319
And the sun
would shine every day.

13:19.285 --> 13:21.753
[sighs]

13:23.819 --> 13:27.385
The world is full
of terrible people.

13:39.719 --> 13:42.819
[Mary] <i>Constance believes
in the goodness of people.</i>

13:44.052 --> 13:47.017
Nothing bad will happen,
Merricat.

13:47.019 --> 13:49.552
I promise.

13:53.518 --> 13:54.817
[door hinges squeak]

13:54.819 --> 13:59.383
- [whistling, song begins]
- [door shuts]

13:59.385 --> 14:02.385
[song continues]

14:13.517 --> 14:17.451
[singing in Italian
from record player]

14:36.585 --> 14:39.484
[muffled song continues]

14:48.317 --> 14:51.617
[Constance speaks Italian]

15:17.951 --> 15:20.816
[Mary] <i>A new wickedness
is coming,</i>

15:20.818 --> 15:22.614
<i>I feel it,</i>

15:22.616 --> 15:26.381
<i>so I cast a spell
of strong protection.</i>

15:26.383 --> 15:28.581
<i>I bury another silver coin</i>

15:28.583 --> 15:33.716
<i>along with a doll Father gave
Constance whose eyes can never shut.</i>

15:33.718 --> 15:37.881
<i>I nail the book Father gave me
to the pine tree.</i>

15:37.883 --> 15:41.414
<i>As long as they
remain in place,</i>

15:41.416 --> 15:44.347
<i>Constance will be safe.</i>

15:44.349 --> 15:47.650
- [song ends abruptly]
- [birds chirping}

15:55.483 --> 15:57.748
She's brought
someone else.

15:57.750 --> 15:59.650
Are you frightened?

16:00.717 --> 16:02.948
No.

16:02.950 --> 16:05.316
I'll send them away.

16:06.316 --> 16:08.750
Answer the door.

16:17.683 --> 16:19.580
Good afternoon,
Mary Katherine.

16:19.582 --> 16:22.447
I brought Lucille Wright.
You remember her?

16:22.449 --> 16:24.481
And Mr. Clarke, of course.

16:24.483 --> 16:26.247
Goodbye, dear.

16:26.249 --> 16:29.316
I'll come pick
you girls up in an hour.

16:30.349 --> 16:31.849
Goodbye, Mary Katherine...

16:35.348 --> 16:38.114
Oh, Helen,
the staircase.

16:38.116 --> 16:40.680
Oregonian pine.

16:40.682 --> 16:42.414
Shame.

16:42.416 --> 16:44.983
Nobody sees it anymore.

16:47.682 --> 16:48.947
[Constance] Tea?

16:48.949 --> 16:50.447
[Helen] The garden looks
beautiful, Constance.

16:50.449 --> 16:52.547
I do so love a garden.
I do.

16:52.549 --> 16:56.181
This year we raised $600 at the
Friends of Miss Porter's Iris Contest.

16:56.183 --> 16:57.714
Six hundred dollars!

16:57.716 --> 16:59.413
An iris contest
this early?

16:59.415 --> 17:01.346
Adrian Whittle won
with her plum iris.

17:01.348 --> 17:04.714
You could have beat her to a pulp
with your Night Ruler, Constance.

17:04.715 --> 17:06.779
You're missing so much.

17:06.781 --> 17:08.013
[whispers] So much.

17:08.016 --> 17:09.781
[Helen] I care
about you, dear.

17:11.515 --> 17:13.382
Your mother
and I were such...

17:14.982 --> 17:18.280
It's spring. You're young.
You're lovely.

17:18.281 --> 17:21.881
You have a right to be happy.
Come back to the world, dear.

17:23.582 --> 17:25.848
We've forgotten the milk.

17:27.183 --> 17:28.947
Thank you, dear.

17:28.949 --> 17:32.413
I mean, not too much at first.
That would look odd.

17:32.415 --> 17:34.479
- [Lucille] Or, perhaps dinner.
- [Helen] Dinner.

17:34.481 --> 17:39.081
[Mary] <i>Make Constance stay.
Make Constance stay. Make Constance stay.</i>

17:39.083 --> 17:41.982
[crashes]

17:45.415 --> 17:47.916
I'll think about it.

17:51.149 --> 17:54.213
[Mary] No one will come here.
They're too afraid.

17:54.215 --> 17:56.512
[Helen] Good heavens,
Mary Katherine.

17:56.514 --> 17:59.013
- They hate us.
- Nonsense.

17:59.015 --> 18:01.345
I don't listen to their gossip,
and neither should you.

18:01.347 --> 18:03.046
People will gossip.

18:03.048 --> 18:05.013
Father used to say the
townspeople were lazy animals.

18:05.015 --> 18:07.279
- Trash.
- Rum cake?

18:07.281 --> 18:10.512
[Mary] He said if they only worked a
little harder they could have a castle too,

18:10.514 --> 18:13.345
and then they could grow things
like stores and roads

18:13.347 --> 18:16.846
- and beautiful gardens.
- Do you really suppose people are afraid to visit here?

18:16.848 --> 18:19.612
[Julian] Afraid
to visit here?

18:19.614 --> 18:22.979
My niece was
acquitted of murder.

18:22.981 --> 18:26.379
There could be no possible
danger in visiting here now.

18:26.381 --> 18:28.546
Julian Blackwood.

18:28.548 --> 18:30.778
Hello. Lucille Wright.

18:30.780 --> 18:33.978
- Hello, Julian.
- [Julian] Though one could say

18:33.980 --> 18:36.945
there's danger everywhere.

18:36.947 --> 18:39.412
Danger of poison, certainly.

18:39.414 --> 18:41.512
My niece, Constance,

18:41.514 --> 18:45.312
could tell you of the most
unlikely of perils,

18:45.314 --> 18:48.745
garden plants
more deadly than snakes,

18:48.747 --> 18:53.679
and simple herbs that slash like knives
through the lining of your belly, madam.

18:53.681 --> 18:55.344
That's all
been forgotten.

18:55.346 --> 18:57.279
No one ever thinks
about it anymore.

18:57.281 --> 19:01.545
A most fascinating case, one of the
true genuine mysteries of our time,

19:01.547 --> 19:05.411
of my... time, particularly.

19:05.413 --> 19:08.778
And I survived
to tell the story.

19:08.780 --> 19:10.778
I followed the trial...
Julian,

19:10.780 --> 19:14.045
there is such a thing
as good taste.

19:14.047 --> 19:16.611
Taste, madam?

19:16.613 --> 19:19.344
Have you ever tasted arsenic?

19:19.346 --> 19:22.079
You mean you remember?

19:22.081 --> 19:26.145
A family gathering

19:26.147 --> 19:28.947
for the evening meal.

19:31.046 --> 19:33.145
Never supposed to be the last.

19:33.147 --> 19:37.210
The dining room?
Just a glance?

19:37.212 --> 19:38.447
Lucille!

19:40.212 --> 19:41.447
Lucille!

19:47.547 --> 19:50.745
I used that sugar myself

19:50.747 --> 19:53.079
on my blackberries.

19:53.081 --> 19:58.011
Luckily, fate intervened.

19:58.013 --> 20:00.045
Some of us, that day,

20:00.047 --> 20:04.844
she led inexorably
through the gates of death.

20:04.846 --> 20:09.811
<i>[Julian] I took
very little sugar.</i>

20:09.813 --> 20:12.278
I told her not to mention it.
I swear I did.

20:12.280 --> 20:16.944
Constance, I swear. I wouldn't
have brought her here.

20:16.946 --> 20:19.811
My brother, John,

20:19.813 --> 20:22.111
at the table that night.

20:22.113 --> 20:24.811
And you will notice
my sister-in-law,

20:24.813 --> 20:27.977
who was, madam,
a delicate woman,

20:27.979 --> 20:30.444
a woman born for tragedy.

20:30.446 --> 20:31.744
And the girls.

20:31.746 --> 20:33.511
Yes. Constance.

20:36.312 --> 20:41.644
Merricat... was not
at the table that night.

20:41.646 --> 20:45.011
A great child of 12,
sent to bed without her supper.

20:45.013 --> 20:47.844
I remember the meal perfectly.

20:47.846 --> 20:49.610
Spring lamb

20:49.612 --> 20:51.943
roasted with mint jelly...

20:51.945 --> 20:54.676
But the blackberries
were the important part.

20:54.678 --> 20:57.011
I can see that
you are about to ask

20:57.013 --> 20:59.877
why she should conceivably
have used arsenic

20:59.879 --> 21:02.944
when she can put her hand
upon a bewildering array

21:02.946 --> 21:06.910
of deadly substances
without ever leaving home.

21:06.912 --> 21:08.811
But she bought
the arsenic,

21:08.813 --> 21:11.477
- [Lucille] she told them.
- To kill rats.

21:11.479 --> 21:13.910
[Lucille] Why?
Why did she do it?

21:13.912 --> 21:18.976
Unless, of course, she's some sort of
homicidal maniac or a mass murderer.

21:18.978 --> 21:20.576
[Julian] Why?

21:20.578 --> 21:22.409
She was let off by the jury.

21:22.411 --> 21:26.943
Too pretty and well-bred
to be locked up forever.

21:26.945 --> 21:29.177
But she told the police
it was her fault,

21:29.179 --> 21:30.912
that they deserved to die.

21:32.045 --> 21:34.812
I deserve to die.

21:36.545 --> 21:40.342
We all do, don't we?

21:40.344 --> 21:41.812
[car horn honks]

21:45.244 --> 21:48.077
- Don't we?
- [Helen] Lucille.

21:48.079 --> 21:49.810
We're leaving.

21:49.812 --> 21:52.810
- I told you not to mention it!
- [Lucille] I'm sorry.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.208
- I know. I know, but...
- Didn't I tell you?!

21:55.210 --> 21:58.176
- [Lucille] I didn't know that he was going to...
- [car door shuts]

21:58.178 --> 22:00.410
You stupid bitch.

22:02.344 --> 22:07.208
Constance, how was I?

22:07.210 --> 22:09.608
Charming, Uncle Julian.

22:09.610 --> 22:13.275
You didn't need
your notes at all.

22:13.277 --> 22:16.944
It did happen,
didn't it?

22:18.179 --> 22:20.943
Yes, it did.

22:20.945 --> 22:24.842
If I'm spared the time,
I will write the book.

22:24.844 --> 22:30.909
If not, please see to it that my notes
are entrusted to some worthy cynic

22:30.911 --> 22:35.109
who will not be too concerned
with the truth.

22:35.111 --> 22:38.677
[eerie piano music]

22:48.243 --> 22:51.676
[wind howling]

22:54.810 --> 22:57.243
[Mary] Father?

23:44.876 --> 23:46.376
[Constance]
What are you doing?

23:47.676 --> 23:51.242
[Mary] I heard Father
in his room.

23:52.143 --> 23:53.843
They're gone.

23:56.209 --> 23:58.643
I feel him coming back.

24:15.177 --> 24:17.576
[pencil scratching]

24:32.077 --> 24:34.373
Merricat!

24:34.375 --> 24:37.341
I need you
to go to town.

24:40.176 --> 24:41.273
It's not my day to go.

24:41.275 --> 24:42.440
We're out of sugar.

24:42.442 --> 24:44.040
I want to make
a rhubarb pie.

24:44.042 --> 24:45.506
I dislike rhubarb.

24:45.508 --> 24:47.239
But it has the prettiest
colors of all.

24:47.241 --> 24:51.108
Nothing looks so beautiful
on the shelves as rhubarb jam.

24:51.110 --> 24:52.809
Make it
for the shelves, then.

24:55.241 --> 24:57.108
Here are the coins.

24:57.110 --> 24:59.809
But it's not my day.

25:01.542 --> 25:06.040
You'll be back
in time for lunch.

25:06.042 --> 25:09.374
[Mary] <i>I didn't know
I would be going to town.</i>

25:11.176 --> 25:12.439
Lock the door behind me.

25:12.441 --> 25:14.440
- [bell rings]
- [Mary] Sugar.

25:14.442 --> 25:17.940
<i>I had no time
to check my safeguards.</i>

25:17.942 --> 25:20.809
<i>The house
would not be secure.</i>

25:22.241 --> 25:23.975
[man]
Nothing but trouble.

25:26.508 --> 25:29.306
<i>If I would have known
I needed to go today...</i>

25:29.308 --> 25:31.640
- Whoa!
- <i>...a Thursday...</i>

25:31.642 --> 25:33.806
Hey, Mary Katherine, where are
you going all dressed up?

25:33.808 --> 25:36.972
<i>...I would've checked
my coins.</i>

25:36.974 --> 25:38.208
<i>And my doll.</i>

25:39.908 --> 25:43.741
<i>And I would have checked Father's
book was firm on the tree.</i>

25:50.909 --> 25:52.505
[gasps] There you are.

25:52.507 --> 25:56.238
Constance, Father's book
has fallen from the tree.

25:56.240 --> 25:58.672
It's our cousin,
Charles Blackwood.

25:58.674 --> 26:02.139
I knew him at once.
He looks just like Father.

26:02.141 --> 26:07.139
[Charles] It's a pleasure
to finally meet you, Mary.

26:07.141 --> 26:10.073
Got a hug for your cousin?

26:10.075 --> 26:14.307
[Constance] Merricat,
he's come to see us.

26:15.974 --> 26:18.273
[ominous music]

26:20.374 --> 26:22.641
[panting]

26:43.174 --> 26:45.473
[whippoorwill sings]

27:05.373 --> 27:10.404
[Julian] "I won't have it."
End quote.

27:10.406 --> 27:13.773
- [meows]
- "And I listened at the door...

27:17.306 --> 27:18.740
[Julian continues]
of course...

27:21.306 --> 27:23.807
as they quarreled hatefully."

27:29.007 --> 27:32.807
You slept in your garden
on the moon, didn't you?

27:36.007 --> 27:42.639
I didn't come in in time to hear
what they were quarrelling about.

27:52.305 --> 27:53.973
Silly Merricat.

27:57.205 --> 28:00.605
[Mary] Uncle Julian doesn't
like your omelets anymore?

28:01.472 --> 28:03.238
The fruit is for Charles.

28:05.339 --> 28:07.904
- [Charles] Morning.
- [cat hissing]

28:07.906 --> 28:08.940
[Charles] Oh!

28:09.906 --> 28:11.705
Uh...

28:11.707 --> 28:13.236
Oh, it's okay.
I've got it, Charles.

28:13.238 --> 28:14.573
[meows]

28:16.772 --> 28:18.939
Good morning,
Cousin Mary.

28:21.605 --> 28:23.704
- Shy?
- [Constance laughs]

28:23.706 --> 28:26.004
We don't see
a lot of strangers.

28:26.006 --> 28:27.639
Mmm.

28:28.605 --> 28:31.303
Now that's a handsome cat.

28:31.305 --> 28:33.603
What's his name?

28:33.605 --> 28:35.704
Jonas.

28:35.706 --> 28:38.336
Jonas?

28:38.338 --> 28:41.336
Jonas? Is he
your special pet?

28:41.338 --> 28:43.637
- Yes.
- [Jonas meows gently]

28:43.639 --> 28:48.971
Well, we're going to be very good
friends, you, Jonas and I.

28:49.972 --> 28:51.936
[Julian] Charles.

28:51.938 --> 28:56.904
[Mary] <i>I see Uncle Julian
and Constance light up for him.</i>

28:56.906 --> 29:00.136
<i>His presence
is a strange new spell.</i>

29:00.138 --> 29:02.937
- Are those pancakes?
- <i>I am powerless before it.</i>

29:02.939 --> 29:06.504
It's been a long time since
anyone's made me pancakes.

29:07.538 --> 29:10.602
- Delicious.
- <i>But he came unbidden,</i>

29:10.604 --> 29:13.237
<i>and I will drive him away.</i>

29:17.204 --> 29:23.672
Your, uh... great,
uh, great-grandfather...

29:24.738 --> 29:27.369
planted those trees
over there.

29:27.371 --> 29:28.838
[Charles] Hmm.

29:32.504 --> 29:34.838
They're really nice.

29:36.805 --> 29:39.438
A little crooked.

29:45.805 --> 29:46.703
Should we...?

29:46.705 --> 29:48.936
Oh, that's all right.

29:48.938 --> 29:53.204
I... need my exercise.

30:02.371 --> 30:07.336
Don't tidy Father's room this morning.
Charles is staying there.

30:44.171 --> 30:45.970
[exhales]

30:51.235 --> 30:53.837
[gentle music]

30:54.970 --> 31:00.333
[Charles] But Venice
is my favorite.

31:00.335 --> 31:04.035
You lose yourself
in a maze of beauty.

31:04.037 --> 31:06.801
Canals of singing <i>gondolieri</i>

31:06.803 --> 31:09.934
and narrow streets where
every corner looks the same.

31:09.936 --> 31:12.934
But, what is most chilling

31:12.936 --> 31:14.668
is that when you walk,

31:14.670 --> 31:16.935
your footsteps echo behind you,

31:16.937 --> 31:19.333
and you think that
someone's following you.

31:19.335 --> 31:23.468
Your shoes are loud
on the cobblestones,

31:23.470 --> 31:26.401
and when you stop,

31:26.403 --> 31:29.403
it sounds as though
someone else has stopped.

31:32.737 --> 31:36.500
But, I suppose,

31:36.502 --> 31:40.467
if you had someone
walking with you,

31:40.469 --> 31:43.134
if you were not alone,

31:43.136 --> 31:45.467
then it wouldn't really matter

31:45.469 --> 31:49.467
if you were being
followed or not.

31:49.469 --> 31:52.333
I've never been
anywhere.

31:52.335 --> 31:54.901
Too bad. Why is that?

31:54.903 --> 31:59.302
Father said everything that
mattered was in America.

32:02.802 --> 32:05.767
Uncle Julian,
here's a biscuit.

32:05.769 --> 32:07.034
Eat the soft side.

32:07.036 --> 32:09.100
Constance,

32:09.102 --> 32:14.001
do you think I should begin
Chapter 45 with:

32:14.003 --> 32:17.634
"It was a fine morning,
a bright fine morning,

32:17.636 --> 32:20.667
but none of them
knew it was their last."

32:20.669 --> 32:23.800
Uncle Julian,

32:23.802 --> 32:26.300
do we need to discuss
that right now?

32:26.302 --> 32:28.869
It was so long ago.

32:31.836 --> 32:37.234
That chair is
my dead brother's chair.

32:39.268 --> 32:43.234
That last time I saw him there
he was foaming at the mouth.

32:44.602 --> 32:47.434
Can it all just be forgotten?

32:47.436 --> 32:51.133
- Forgotten?
- [Charles] We don't want to talk about that bad time.

32:51.135 --> 32:53.067
Okay?

32:53.069 --> 32:57.299
I believe that you are speaking
slightingly of my life's work.

32:57.301 --> 32:58.802
Sit down, Constance.

33:02.368 --> 33:04.533
Why don't we

33:04.535 --> 33:06.966
tuck in your napkin here

33:06.968 --> 33:11.901
or you're gonna
mess yourself, buddy.

33:14.535 --> 33:18.766
You're missing a button, Charles.
I'll sew it for you.

33:18.768 --> 33:19.902
Oh.

33:24.767 --> 33:28.668
I, uh, noticed this morning
there was a broken step out back.

33:32.102 --> 33:33.565
How about I fix
it for you?

33:33.567 --> 33:36.632
That would be
very kind of you.

33:36.634 --> 33:38.433
And I could also go
to the village

33:38.435 --> 33:39.799
and pick up
whatever you need...

33:39.801 --> 33:41.399
I go to the village
on Tuesdays.

33:41.401 --> 33:43.900
- You do?

01:07:20.505 --> 01:07:22.435
We just cleaned it.

01:07:22.437 --> 01:07:24.904
- Constance...
- It has no right to burn.

01:07:33.471 --> 01:07:35.705
[continues honking]

01:07:36.871 --> 01:07:38.738

01:07:51.438 --> 01:07:55.370
[fire engines approaching]

01:08:05.104 --> 01:08:07.170
Uncle Julian.

01:08:08.138 --> 01:08:10.069
[Constance]
Uncle Julian!

01:08:10.071 --> 01:08:12.604
Uncle Julian, open the door.

01:08:13.704 --> 01:08:15.402
[knocking]

01:08:15.404 --> 01:08:17.537
Uncle Julian, open the door.

01:08:20.871 --> 01:08:22.035
[Jim] Clear the house.

01:08:22.037 --> 01:08:24.203
Do you hear me?
Clear the house!

01:08:31.737 --> 01:08:33.368
[coughing]

01:08:33.370 --> 01:08:35.537
Throw up that bottom line
and get up in the tanks.

01:08:42.337 --> 01:08:44.201
That's a fire,
all right.

01:08:44.203 --> 01:08:48.537
Oh yeah, that's a fire.

01:08:53.871 --> 01:08:56.703
[crowd murmurs]

01:08:57.870 --> 01:08:59.367
Why not let it burn, Jim?

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:01.801
Now, Bobby, you know sure well

01:09:01.803 --> 01:09:04.968
we can't let
this fine manor fall.

01:09:04.970 --> 01:09:06.203
We're firemen.

01:09:07.136 --> 01:09:09.167
We gotta put it out.

01:09:09.170 --> 01:09:11.770
[indistinct shouting]

01:09:19.403 --> 01:09:21.903
Move it, move it!
Everyone out! Clear the house.

01:09:43.036 --> 01:09:44.701
[crowd chattering continues]

01:09:44.703 --> 01:09:48.868
[man] We should have
burned it down years ago!

01:09:50.736 --> 01:09:51.733
Let it burn!

01:09:51.734 --> 01:09:52.867
Let it burn!

Let it burn!
Let it burn!

01:10:02.670 --> 01:10:05.901
"Merricat," said Connie,
"would you like a cup of tea?"

01:10:05.903 --> 01:10:09.200
"Oh no," said Merricat,
"you'll poison me."

01:10:09.202 --> 01:10:11.768
- [chanting continues]
- Let it burn!

01:10:11.770 --> 01:10:17.268

Merricat.

01:10:18.702 --> 01:10:20.266
[crowd cheers]

01:10:20.268 --> 01:10:22.000
[Mary] <i>The sound of their hate</i>

01:10:22.002 --> 01:10:23.635
<i>is another kind of fire</i>

01:10:24.935 --> 01:10:28.335
<i>moving through the bones
of our house.</i>

01:10:30.669 --> 01:10:34.902
<i>I know now that
all of my spells are broken.</i>

01:10:36.435 --> 01:10:39.567
<i>What was buried here
in this village,</i>

01:10:40.435 --> 01:10:44.500
<i>their want for our ruin,</i>

01:10:44.502 --> 01:10:47.535
<i>has come to the surface
at last.</i>

01:10:52.902 --> 01:10:54.067
[man] Where are the girls?

01:10:54.069 --> 01:10:55.499
Fire's all out, folks.

01:10:55.501 --> 01:10:57.400
[woman] Should have just let
that fire burn, Jim.

01:10:57.402 --> 01:10:59.466
[man] Should've burned
down years ago.

01:10:59.468 --> 01:11:01.899
[man 2] Now what do we do, Jim?

01:11:01.901 --> 01:11:03.268

[shouting continues]

01:12:05.267 --> 01:12:07.566
What the goddamn hell
is going on here?!

01:12:09.035 --> 01:12:10.698
[Charles]
Get out of here!

01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:12.631
Get out!

01:12:12.633 --> 01:12:16.965
[panting]

01:12:16.967 --> 01:12:18.598
[Woman] Don't forget
the candlesticks!

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:19.498
Go!

[boys taunting]
Merricat! Merricat!

01:13:00.599 --> 01:13:03.166

the little debutante.

01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:22.864
What are you doing?
Leave them!

[Stella] Stop it! Stop it!

01:13:25.832 --> 01:13:26.931
No! No!

01:13:26.933 --> 01:13:28.930
That's enough!
Stop it!

01:13:28.932 --> 01:13:30.830
[Sam] That's enough!
You listen to me!

01:13:30.832 --> 01:13:34.031

01:13:40.666 --> 01:13:42.899
[panting]

01:13:44.099 --> 01:13:45.797
Julian Blackwood is dead.

01:13:45.799 --> 01:13:48.897
There's been a death in this house.
You get out of here!

01:13:48.899 --> 01:13:51.766
[Constance sobbing]

01:13:55.966 --> 01:13:59.365
Go on now!
Get out of here!

[birds singing]

01:14:50.766 --> 01:14:52.531
[gasps]

01:14:54.431 --> 01:14:57.631
We're on the moon
at last.

01:15:03.132 --> 01:15:05.665
[Constance] Uncle Julian.

01:15:19.865 --> 01:15:22.431
Poor Uncle Julian.

01:15:24.263 --> 01:15:26.831
Who will write
his book?

01:15:51.530 --> 01:15:53.498
[footsteps approaching]

01:16:03.897 --> 01:16:06.895
[sighs] My kitchen.

01:16:06.897 --> 01:16:08.563
[Jonas meows]

01:17:03.729 --> 01:17:07.863
I'm going to put death in all
their food and watch them die.

01:17:09.996 --> 01:17:12.562
Like you
did before?

01:17:16.796 --> 01:17:19.496
I'm sorry.

01:17:20.896 --> 01:17:23.529
He was wicked.

01:17:24.829 --> 01:17:28.061
He was a very wicked man,
our father.

01:17:28.063 --> 01:17:30.395
He was very wicked to me.

01:17:46.829 --> 01:17:48.495
I put it in the sugar.

01:17:50.696 --> 01:17:52.596
I know.

01:17:53.729 --> 01:17:55.729
I knew then.

01:17:58.294 --> 01:18:01.762
- You never use sugar.
- No.

01:18:03.228 --> 01:18:05.427
No... no.

01:18:05.429 --> 01:18:08.596
That's why I put it
in the sugar.

01:18:09.795 --> 01:18:12.261
[Constance]
You saved me, my Merricat.

01:18:20.662 --> 01:18:23.161
We'll never talk
about it again.

01:18:28.595 --> 01:18:29.928
Never.

01:18:32.628 --> 01:18:35.695
- Never again.
- [knocking]

01:18:36.928 --> 01:18:37.926
[Helen] Constance?

01:18:37.928 --> 01:18:39.960
[knocking continues]

01:18:39.962 --> 01:18:41.893
Constance?

01:18:41.895 --> 01:18:43.027
[insistent knocking]

01:18:43.029 --> 01:18:45.059
It's Helen and Sam Clarke.

01:18:45.061 --> 01:18:47.793
Open the door, dear.

01:18:47.795 --> 01:18:49.893
Never again.

01:18:49.895 --> 01:18:51.861
Never.

01:18:52.928 --> 01:18:54.291
[whispers] Never...

01:18:54.293 --> 01:18:55.693
[Sam] Constance?

01:18:55.695 --> 01:18:57.792
I just thought
you'd like to know that

01:18:57.794 --> 01:19:00.225
your Uncle Julian's funeral
is the day after tomorrow.

01:19:00.227 --> 01:19:02.593
There's a lot
of flowers already.

01:19:02.595 --> 01:19:07.993
I think you'd be very impressed if you could
see all the flowers we all sent Julian.

01:19:07.995 --> 01:19:09.358
We're your friends, dear.

01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:11.326
You shouldn't drive away
your friends.

01:19:11.328 --> 01:19:15.859
Constance, everything's fine.
We're going to forget all about it.

01:19:15.861 --> 01:19:20.760
In a few weeks, no one will
even remember what happened.

01:19:20.762 --> 01:19:23.460
[water dripping]

01:19:28.894 --> 01:19:30.825
Sam, break down the door.

01:19:30.827 --> 01:19:32.525
No.

01:19:32.527 --> 01:19:35.026
Every window's already broken
in the place already, Helen.

01:19:35.028 --> 01:19:36.825
I'm not gonna break anything
else, for Christ's sake.

01:19:36.827 --> 01:19:38.792
Then climb in a window,
for God's sakes.

01:19:38.794 --> 01:19:41.225
No. Look, leave them. They'll
come out when they're ready.

01:19:41.227 --> 01:19:42.794
They're not children.

01:19:57.559 --> 01:19:59.694
We can't go upstairs.

01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:08.958
[pounding on door]

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:12.791
[Ned] Hey, Miss Constance?

01:20:12.793 --> 01:20:15.726
Hey, Miss Constance?

01:20:17.227 --> 01:20:21.091
I... I got a chicken here.

01:20:21.093 --> 01:20:24.557
My wife roasted it up nice.

01:20:24.559 --> 01:20:30.326
[stammers] And there's
some cookies and pie.

01:20:31.426 --> 01:20:34.224
I hope you can hear me.

01:20:34.226 --> 01:20:36.958
I, uh...

01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:40.858
I broke one of your chairs.

01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:43.426
I'm-I'm sorry.

01:20:45.893 --> 01:20:50.526
[stammers] I'll just
leave it here.

01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:58.926
Sorry again.

01:21:03.291 --> 01:21:06.425
Do you think
it's as good as my pies?

01:21:27.792 --> 01:21:30.525
- [hammering]
- [Constance] Leave it, Merricat.

01:21:31.859 --> 01:21:33.158
Let some sun in.

01:21:44.793 --> 01:21:47.358
[knocking]

01:21:48.291 --> 01:21:49.790
More food.

01:21:49.792 --> 01:21:54.258
We're the biggest
church supper they ever had.

01:21:55.792 --> 01:21:58.757
[insistent knocking]

01:21:58.759 --> 01:22:00.857
[Charles] Connie?

01:22:00.859 --> 01:22:02.889
I'm back.

01:22:02.891 --> 01:22:04.859
Constance?

01:22:11.358 --> 01:22:12.624
[Charles]
Darling.

01:22:16.358 --> 01:22:18.357
Let's forget all that
ever happened.

01:22:22.058 --> 01:22:24.023
I want to be friends again.

01:22:24.025 --> 01:22:26.791
Will you open the door?

01:22:28.959 --> 01:22:32.490
Connie, I didn't mean
for that to happen.

01:22:32.492 --> 01:22:34.056
I didn't. I'm sorry.

01:22:34.058 --> 01:22:36.391
I can help you, Connie.

01:22:37.758 --> 01:22:38.989
I can.

01:22:38.991 --> 01:22:42.689
We can have a life together,

01:22:42.691 --> 01:22:44.623
away from here.

01:22:44.625 --> 01:22:46.624
Don't you want that, Connie?

01:22:48.724 --> 01:22:51.188
Italy.

01:22:51.190 --> 01:22:54.322
Remember how that felt?
Remember...

01:22:54.324 --> 01:22:55.758
when I held you?

01:23:03.624 --> 01:23:05.624
Connie...

01:23:08.157 --> 01:23:11.322
Please, you have
to open the door.

01:23:11.324 --> 01:23:13.157
You understand?

01:23:16.058 --> 01:23:20.557
I can't help you
if you don't let me.

01:23:22.424 --> 01:23:25.389
Do you hear me, Connie?

01:23:25.391 --> 01:23:28.956
I can't help you
if you don't let me.

01:23:28.958 --> 01:23:32.222
And I'm not going away.

01:23:32.224 --> 01:23:34.223
I'm not going away, Connie.

01:23:42.490 --> 01:23:45.988
- [jiggles door]
- [groans]

01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:48.657
There will never be
anyone like me, Connie.

01:23:50.424 --> 01:23:52.890
Who's gonna love you?

01:23:54.690 --> 01:23:56.522
Nobody.

01:23:56.524 --> 01:23:59.457
Nobody's gonna love you.

01:24:01.923 --> 01:24:04.757
Is that what you want, Connie?

01:24:06.289 --> 01:24:09.289
I don't deserve
to be treated like this!

01:24:10.223 --> 01:24:11.822
[stammers]

01:24:12.990 --> 01:24:15.554
I could just walk away!

01:24:15.556 --> 01:24:17.488
I could!

01:24:17.490 --> 01:24:20.521
Is that what you want?

01:24:20.523 --> 01:24:23.187
I don't deserve this!
I don't deserve this!

01:24:23.189 --> 01:24:25.388
I don't deserve
to be treated like this!

01:24:25.390 --> 01:24:27.422
I came here to help you!

01:24:29.889 --> 01:24:32.920
[pounding on door]

01:24:32.922 --> 01:24:34.421
[gasps]

01:24:34.423 --> 01:24:37.187
- Hey! Connie!
- No! No! No! No! No!

01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:39.854
No! No! No!

01:24:39.856 --> 01:24:40.921
- Hey, Connie!
- No!

01:24:40.923 --> 01:24:43.621
- No! No! No! No!
- Connie!

01:24:43.623 --> 01:24:46.456
- [Constance screams]
- [grunts]

01:24:49.422 --> 01:24:51.820
[body thuds]

01:24:51.822 --> 01:24:54.455
[panting]

01:26:03.621 --> 01:26:06.686
May I have my lunch,
Constance?

01:26:06.688 --> 01:26:09.755
You can have
whatever you want.

01:26:15.821 --> 01:26:18.388
[birds chirping]

01:26:39.721 --> 01:26:43.154
[curious music]

01:27:22.854 --> 01:27:27.818
<i>My name is
Mary Katherine Blackwood.</i>

01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:29.318
<i>I am 18 years old,</i>

01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:32.787
<i>and I live with my sister,
Constance.</i>

01:27:34.553 --> 01:27:38.586
<i>She is the most precious person
in the world.</i>

01:27:40.787 --> 01:27:43.218
<i>The Blackwoods have always
lived in this house.</i>

01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:47.286
[man] Let's just put the bag down
and get the hell out of here.

01:27:48.654 --> 01:27:53.218
<i>We have never done
anything to hurt anyone.</i>

01:27:53.220 --> 01:27:54.952
Merricat.

01:27:54.954 --> 01:27:56.817
[younger boy] They're probably
not even in there.

01:27:56.819 --> 01:27:58.852
Merricat!

01:27:58.854 --> 01:28:03.118
- <i>We put things back where they belong.</i>
- [older boy] Merricat.

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:05.817
Merricat!

01:28:05.819 --> 01:28:08.751
Merricat!

01:28:08.753 --> 01:28:12.951
- <i>And we will never leave here.</i>
- [older boy] Merricat!

01:28:12.953 --> 01:28:14.517
Are you cooking up some stew?

01:28:14.519 --> 01:28:16.551
What's for dinner?
Babies?

01:28:16.553 --> 01:28:18.150
I bet you like to eat babies!

01:28:18.152 --> 01:28:19.785
[younger boy] I heard
you eat rats!

01:28:19.787 --> 01:28:21.517
You should have burned!

01:28:21.519 --> 01:28:23.517
- Baby rats!
- Burned with all the rest of your things!

01:28:23.519 --> 01:28:26.851
Would you like a cup of tea,
you rat witch!

01:28:26.853 --> 01:28:28.717
Come out and get us!

01:28:28.719 --> 01:28:30.586
You stupid bitch!

01:28:31.953 --> 01:28:34.317
[older boy screams]

01:28:34.319 --> 01:28:36.552
He didn't mean it!

01:28:38.552 --> 01:28:40.884
<i>No matter what they say</i>

01:28:40.886 --> 01:28:42.653
<i>or what they do to us.</i>

01:28:45.185 --> 01:28:46.350
<i>Never.</i>

01:28:46.352 --> 01:28:49.150
What will we have
for lunch today?

01:28:49.152 --> 01:28:50.783
Rhubarb pie.

01:28:50.785 --> 01:28:56.983
I wonder if I could eat a
child if I had the chance.

01:28:56.985 --> 01:29:00.184
I doubt
that I could cook one.

01:29:03.019 --> 01:29:05.618
It must be terrible
to be so afraid.

01:29:11.818 --> 01:29:14.219
I love you, Merricat.

01:29:32.086 --> 01:29:35.351
[slow instrumental music]
