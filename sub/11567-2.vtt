I'm looking for something and

00:04.588 --> 00:08.008
you're gonna help me find it.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.886
What is it you

00:09.009 --> 00:10.886
think I have?

00:10.928 --> 00:14.055
Do you know our families

00:10.928 --> 00:14.055
have a shared history?

00:14.097 --> 00:15.182
Almost hundred years ago,

00:15.223 --> 00:18.519
my family was forced

00:15.223 --> 00:18.519
out of Middleton.

00:18.894 --> 00:20.980
Forced?

00:21.062 --> 00:24.065
My great-grandfather,

00:21.062 --> 00:24.065
Henry, was engaged to

00:21.062 --> 00:24.065
your great-grandmother.

00:24.107 --> 00:26.527
-Laurel Merrywick.

00:24.107 --> 00:26.527
-And as the story goes,

00:26.568 --> 00:29.488
when Henry broke off

00:26.568 --> 00:29.488
the engagement,

00:29.530 --> 00:30.990
Laurel cursed him.

00:32.199 --> 00:34.910
Cursed him for life,

00:32.199 --> 00:34.910
and lineage.

00:34.952 --> 00:38.288
Henry lost his businesses,

00:34.952 --> 00:38.288
he lost his money...

00:38.330 --> 00:41.249
He left Middleton,

00:38.330 --> 00:41.249
angry and broke.

00:41.291 --> 00:43.126
The Merrywicks would

00:41.291 --> 00:43.126
never curse anyone.

00:45.796 --> 00:47.715
I don't believe in curses,

00:49.550 --> 00:53.012
but I do believe in treasure.

00:53.052 --> 00:57.224
Before my father died,

00:53.052 --> 00:57.224
he told me there is a key

00:53.052 --> 00:57.224
hidden here at Grey House.

00:57.265 --> 01:00.769
Given to your relative

00:57.265 --> 01:00.769
by one of my relatives

00:57.265 --> 01:00.769
for safekeeping.

01:01.353 --> 01:02.771
A key.

01:02.813 --> 01:07.275
It belongs to a

01:02.813 --> 01:07.275
safety deposit box at

01:02.813 --> 01:07.275
Middleton National Bank.

01:07.317 --> 01:11.071
There is a lot of family

01:07.317 --> 01:11.071
jewelry from that time

01:07.317 --> 01:11.071
not accounted for.

01:11.112 --> 01:15.116
I believe that safety deposit

01:11.112 --> 01:15.116
box contains a small fortune,

01:15.158 --> 01:16.451
that will change my life.

you need to check out.

-Not without that key.

02:18.889 --> 02:21.100
-What key?

02:21.141 --> 02:24.352
My great-grandfather

02:21.141 --> 02:24.352
was Henry Weld.

02:24.394 --> 02:27.147
He left something

02:24.394 --> 02:27.147
of value here, and

02:24.394 --> 02:27.147
I'm here to claim it.

02:42.788 --> 02:44.999
Well, the story

02:42.788 --> 02:44.999
as I know it,

02:45.040 --> 02:48.376
was Henry lost

02:45.040 --> 02:48.376
the family fortune on

02:45.040 --> 02:48.376

02:48.418 --> 02:52.464
His actions caused

02:48.418 --> 02:52.464
a huge rift in the family.

02:52.506 --> 02:56.468
They fled Middleton

02:52.506 --> 02:56.468

02:58.345 --> 03:00.639
as simple as they seem.

You trust him?

03:02.891 --> 03:05.060

03:16.530 --> 03:19.282
You heard what Grandpa

03:16.530 --> 03:19.282
said about the Welds.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.284
It's wrong to form

03:19.324 --> 03:21.284

No, he's creepy.

03:26.915 --> 03:29.626
Okay, well, being

03:26.915 --> 03:29.626
different isn't creepy.

03:29.668 --> 03:30.418
Just different.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.172
I think he should leave.

03:33.212 --> 03:35.256
I think that

03:33.212 --> 03:35.256
you're being unfair.

He could be dangerous.

18:47.877 --> 18:50.088
When did you

18:47.877 --> 18:50.088
become so wise?

18:51.255 --> 18:53.382
I'm like the Obi-Wan

18:51.255 --> 18:53.382
of this place.

18:53.424 --> 18:54.801
(LAUGHS)

18:55.843 --> 18:58.262
How goes the maze?

18:58.304 --> 19:00.598
Well, let's just say it's not

18:58.304 --> 19:00.598
the Halloween I'd hoped for.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.224
Oh.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.560
I bought tickets

19:02.266 --> 19:04.560
to the Blairsville

19:02.266 --> 19:04.560
cemetery crawl.

19:04.602 --> 19:06.479
Oh! Spooky fun?

19:06.520 --> 19:09.690
(LAUGHS) That Nick will be

19:06.520 --> 19:09.690
having with his friend, John.

19:11.067 --> 19:13.527
I really thought

19:11.067 --> 19:13.527
I could get a do-over.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.905
I'm not sure there is such

19:13.569 --> 19:15.905
a thing as a true do-over.

-Meaning?

19:16.906 --> 19:19.033
-(LAUGHS)

19:19.075 --> 19:22.495
I'm just saying,

19:19.075 --> 19:22.495
focus on the now.

19:22.536 --> 19:25.706
Kids will go off

19:22.536 --> 19:25.706
and live their lives like

19:22.536 --> 19:25.706
they are supposed to.

19:25.748 --> 19:29.710
But they come back,

19:25.748 --> 19:29.710
and when they do,

19:25.748 --> 19:29.710
just make sure you're there.

19:55.820 --> 19:57.196
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

19:59.991 --> 20:02.284
I think this will be perfect.

20:02.326 --> 20:05.412
Cassie, I have failed

20:02.326 --> 20:05.412
my office and my town.

20:05.454 --> 20:06.580
Martha...

20:06.622 --> 20:10.126
I need over 100

20:06.622 --> 20:10.126
carved pumpkins

20:06.622 --> 20:10.126
by tomorrow.

20:10.168 --> 20:11.627
Impossible.

20:11.669 --> 20:14.005
You just need to think outside

20:11.669 --> 20:14.005
the box, or the pumpkin.

20:14.630 --> 20:16.590
No. No use.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.759
Well, do you want to

20:16.632 --> 20:18.759
set up a carving station

20:16.632 --> 20:18.759
at Grey House?

20:18.801 --> 20:20.594
Oh, how sweet! No.

20:21.512 --> 20:22.555
Okay.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.684
Could you do me favor?

20:26.726 --> 20:30.938
I need to deliver these

20:26.726 --> 20:30.938
to the festival coordinator

20:26.726 --> 20:30.938
at the park.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.857
They're gonna be used

20:30.980 --> 20:32.857
for prizes for apple bobbing.

20:33.858 --> 20:36.276
Sure, why not?

20:36.318 --> 20:39.238
My professional reputation

20:36.318 --> 20:39.238
is hanging by a thread,

20:39.279 --> 20:42.992
but by all means,

20:39.279 --> 20:42.992
let's get these stuffed ghosts

20:39.279 --> 20:42.992
to the festival.

20:46.495 --> 20:48.622
-Good afternoon, Martha.

20:46.495 --> 20:48.622
-Mmm-hmm.

20:51.125 --> 20:53.086
-Hey.

20:51.125 --> 20:53.086
-Hey!

20:53.127 --> 20:55.504
-We've been

20:53.127 --> 20:55.504
tailing Joseph.

20:53.127 --> 20:55.504
-Why?

20:55.546 --> 20:58.841
Because I'm not 100% sure

20:55.546 --> 20:58.841
that he and his brother

20:55.546 --> 20:58.841
weren't working together.

21:00.509 --> 21:03.012
I don't think Joseph means me,

21:00.509 --> 21:03.012
or our family, harm.

21:03.054 --> 21:04.847
So where is he?

21:04.889 --> 21:06.515
(SIGHS) I don't know,

21:06.557 --> 21:08.851
but I definitely don't get

21:06.557 --> 21:08.851
a sense of either of them

21:06.557 --> 21:08.851
right now.

21:08.893 --> 21:12.105
Well, you wouldn't get

21:08.893 --> 21:12.105
a sense of Jackson, right,

21:12.146 --> 21:14.690
because he's using

21:12.146 --> 21:14.690
that charm thing

21:12.146 --> 21:14.690
against you.

21:14.732 --> 21:17.860
-Not anymore.

21:14.732 --> 21:17.860
-What do you mean?

21:17.902 --> 21:21.405
Jackson used a charm

21:17.902 --> 21:21.405
to hide his true intentions

21:17.902 --> 21:21.405
from the Merrywick women,

21:21.447 --> 21:24.491
but once you helped me

21:21.447 --> 21:24.491
see he was there,

21:21.447 --> 21:24.491
the charm was broken.

21:24.533 --> 21:25.785
Maybe he left.

21:25.826 --> 21:27.995
They may be out of sight,

21:25.826 --> 21:27.995
but they're not gone.

21:28.037 --> 21:29.997
So there's a warrant out

21:28.037 --> 21:29.997
for breaking-and-entering

21:30.039 --> 21:32.917
and vandalism

21:30.039 --> 21:32.917
at Grey House.

21:32.959 --> 21:36.587
Cassie, Jackson has

21:32.959 --> 21:36.587
a long police record

21:32.959 --> 21:36.587
in Chicago.

21:36.629 --> 21:41.008
He's seriously bad news,

21:36.629 --> 21:41.008
and he clearly has it in

21:36.629 --> 21:41.008
for you and the family.

21:41.050 --> 21:42.593
We need to find him

21:41.050 --> 21:42.593
as soon as possible.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.745

22:07.994 --> 22:09.745

22:15.709 --> 22:16.836
Hey.

22:18.129 --> 22:20.673
-Hi.

22:18.129 --> 22:20.673
-It's coming together.

22:20.714 --> 22:24.010
finish in time.

22:24.051 --> 22:26.344
you got the tickets

22:24.051 --> 22:26.344
for you and me.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.058
No problem.

22:32.143 --> 22:33.894
Go with John tonight.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.605
Thanks, Dad.

22:36.647 --> 22:39.692
So tell me, exactly

22:36.647 --> 22:39.692
what is a cemetery crawl?

22:40.734 --> 22:42.153
It's so cool.

22:42.195 --> 22:44.780
You walk through

22:42.195 --> 22:44.780
the cemetery,

22:44.822 --> 22:47.950
and when you

22:44.822 --> 22:47.950
get to certain graves,

22:44.822 --> 22:47.950
these people pop out

22:47.992 --> 22:49.869
and they talk about

22:47.992 --> 22:49.869
their life...

you'd call me back.

that as long as Jackson

So, we're really not

27:01.370 --> 27:04.123
gonna do Halloween

27:01.370 --> 27:04.123
at Grey House?

27:04.164 --> 27:06.624
With everything going on,

27:04.164 --> 27:06.624
it's just too dangerous.

27:07.376 --> 27:08.794
But we always do Halloween.

27:10.254 --> 27:12.298
How can you be so happy?

27:12.339 --> 27:14.925
I'm just happy

27:12.339 --> 27:14.925
that my whole family

27:12.339 --> 27:14.925
is here with me

27:14.967 --> 27:15.926
and we're all safe.

27:19.305 --> 27:20.347
I'm sorry.

27:23.350 --> 27:26.186

27:23.350 --> 27:26.186

27:26.228 --> 27:28.814
Don't be sorry.

27:28.855 --> 27:32.568
I just can't believe that

27:28.855 --> 27:32.568
we're really not opening up

27:28.855 --> 27:32.568

27:32.610 --> 27:36.238
Halloween isn't about

27:32.610 --> 27:36.238
having trick-or-treaters,

27:32.610 --> 27:36.238
or a haunted house here.

27:36.280 --> 27:40.075
It's about our spirits

27:36.280 --> 27:40.075
and the spirit of the holiday.

27:40.117 --> 27:43.412
And having our

27:40.117 --> 27:43.412
family here together

27:40.117 --> 27:43.412
to share that holiday.

27:44.204 --> 27:46.081
So, open or closed,

27:46.123 --> 27:48.834
it'll still be

27:46.123 --> 27:48.834
