41:06.180 --> 41:09.315
They're...They're gone.

41:09.350 --> 41:11.016
Mm-hmm.

41:12.987 --> 41:15.821
Uh, so, Isabella,
this is -- this is Maggie,

41:15.856 --> 41:17.823
and, Maggie, this is Isabella.

Mm-hmm.

41:22.196 --> 41:23.662
It's nice to meet you.

41:23.698 --> 41:25.698
Yeah,
nice to meet you, too.

Good. Then you'll be ready
more than ever

41:39.013 --> 41:40.629
for the big showdown.

41:40.681 --> 41:42.881

41:42.883 --> 41:45.718
in the Espheni's coffin.
