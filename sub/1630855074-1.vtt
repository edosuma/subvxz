WEBVTT

00:26.944 --> 00:30.364
Caitlyn,
this is a process, okay?

00:30.364 --> 00:32.491
But it's important
for you to remember

00:32.491 --> 00:37.079
that the only person
who can save us is ourselves.

00:37.079 --> 00:38.789
He's a monster.

00:38.789 --> 00:40.832
A goddamn fucking monster.

00:40.832 --> 00:42.751
That's what he is.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.630
But I can't seem
to get away from him.

00:46.630 --> 00:50.008
Do you remember what drew you
to Mitch in the first place?

00:50.008 --> 00:52.261
We met at work, and...

00:55.013 --> 00:59.476
...he was charming
and mysterious.

01:00.727 --> 01:04.815
He wined and dined me
and took me traveling,

01:04.815 --> 01:06.400
and...

01:06.400 --> 01:09.611
he told me it was me and him
against the world.

01:11.280 --> 01:14.032
He made me feel important.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.450
Hello.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.995
My name is
Robert Montague Renfield.

01:17.995 --> 01:20.247
And just like
all these decent folks,

01:20.247 --> 01:23.083
I am in
a destructive relationship.

01:30.632 --> 01:32.926
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
That was a lot.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.929
Maybe we should just back up
to the beginning.

01:37.431 --> 01:42.936
Mr. Renfield, I bid you welcome.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.188
I am...

01:45.188 --> 01:46.773
-Dracula.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.775
When I met him,
I was a real estate lawyer

01:48.775 --> 01:51.320
hoping to make a deal
that would change my life

01:51.320 --> 01:53.196
and my family's lives forever.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.698
Oh, and it most certainly did.

01:54.698 --> 01:59.786
You will make a very good
assistant, Mr. Renfield.

01:59.786 --> 02:02.372
I understand how Caitlyn feels.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.666
I never drink wine.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.501
He also wined and dined me.

02:06.501 --> 02:08.170
He made me feel important.

02:08.170 --> 02:12.007
He introduced me
into high society.

02:12.007 --> 02:13.800
-We went to the theater.

02:14.760 --> 02:18.305
-We traveled to exotic places.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.640
And then he made me
his familiar.

02:21.975 --> 02:25.228
Which means that I take care
of Master's every need.

02:26.063 --> 02:27.647
Including staff changes

02:27.647 --> 02:30.150
and arranging his special
dietary requirements.

02:31.860 --> 02:35.405
Look, I didn't just jump into
serving the Prince of Darkness.

02:35.405 --> 02:36.823
We had some great times.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.326
But just like all great times...

02:39.326 --> 02:41.661
-Servant.
-...they come to an end.

02:41.661 --> 02:44.539
The hunters have returned.

02:45.374 --> 02:46.500
Ah, yes.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.335
The bugs. This comes up a lot.

02:48.335 --> 02:51.505
Dracula's powers come from
consuming human life.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.298
Mine come from eating bugs.

02:53.298 --> 02:56.176
Make sense? Great.
Now, where were we?

03:06.186 --> 03:08.814
-I'm coming, Master!

03:08.814 --> 03:10.273
Shit. Fuck. Shit.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.609
Shit. Fuck. Shit. Fuck.

03:19.866 --> 03:22.702
Sh-Sh-Sh-Shit.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.207
This is a protection circle,
Renfield.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.084
Mm.

03:29.084 --> 03:30.377
He cannot escape.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.963
Let us rid this world
of his evil,

03:32.963 --> 03:34.464
and you can finally be free!

03:34.464 --> 03:37.008
Free?

03:37.008 --> 03:40.804
The moment I'm gone,

03:40.804 --> 03:44.516
they will lock you away
for what you've done for me.

03:45.559 --> 03:49.312
I am your only salvation.

03:52.566 --> 03:56.903
I am your only friend.

03:58.989 --> 04:03.243
I am the only one

04:03.243 --> 04:05.662
who cares for you.

04:05.662 --> 04:08.373
I actually remember thinking,

04:08.373 --> 04:11.418
"He really, really means it
this time."

04:16.298 --> 04:18.091
Renfield!

04:18.091 --> 04:20.677
We are the last of our kind.

04:20.677 --> 04:24.347
From now on, every drop of blood
Dracula spills

04:24.347 --> 04:26.433
will be on your hands.

04:32.439 --> 04:35.942
Fuck. I was not expecting that.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.284
Or that.

04:59.508 --> 05:03.220
Master, you okay?

05:03.220 --> 05:04.930
No.

05:05.889 --> 05:08.016
Yeah.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.976
This is a fairly typical result.

05:09.976 --> 05:12.312
At the peak of his powers,
Dracula goes on

05:12.312 --> 05:14.356
a full-tilt
blood-sucking bender,

05:14.356 --> 05:16.983
the good guys show up
and do their thing,

05:16.983 --> 05:19.694
and then it's up to me
to clean up the mess.

05:19.694 --> 05:23.240
- -It's what
I call our transitional period.

05:23.240 --> 05:26.910
So I take him to a new city,
nurse him back to full power,

05:26.910 --> 05:29.079
find a decent place
to ride it out

05:29.079 --> 05:32.290
until the whole cycle starts
all over again.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.000
Uh, excuse me. H-Hi.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.627
May I borrow a pen, please?

05:37.295 --> 05:38.713
Thank... you.

05:41.132 --> 05:43.260
Which brings us back here.

05:43.260 --> 05:46.680
In the meantime, I come here
and listen to these poor souls

05:46.680 --> 05:49.057
talk about their monsters.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.850
You were just talking
about Mitch, what...

05:50.850 --> 05:54.354
I know this is, like,
way down the list of bad stuff,

05:54.354 --> 05:57.023
but he's also really into ska.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.484
-The kind of music?
-Yes.

05:59.484 --> 06:02.696
Fishbone, Mustard Plug,
Voodoo Glow Skulls.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.614
I fucking hate that shit!

06:06.575 --> 06:08.076
I'm so sorry, Caitlyn. I'm so...

06:08.076 --> 06:10.662
-Mark, I am... I'm so sorry.
-It's okay.

06:10.662 --> 06:13.373
Is that the one
that's 99% horns?

06:13.373 --> 06:14.666
Yeah, see,
that's what I was thinking.

06:14.666 --> 06:16.793
No.
That's a huge oversimplification

06:16.793 --> 06:19.462
of ska's innovative contribution
to music.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.756
Oh, my God, who am I?

06:23.341 --> 06:25.594
-Renfield?
-Hmm?

06:26.595 --> 06:29.848
Sorry, no, I swallowed a bug.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.892
Unintentionally.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.436
What-what other way
is there to...

06:34.436 --> 06:36.021
Would you like
to share your story?

06:36.980 --> 06:39.899
No. Thank-thank you.
I don't think you'd understand.

06:39.899 --> 06:42.652
I know it's scary.

06:42.652 --> 06:45.947
And you think things
are never gonna change,

06:45.947 --> 06:48.325
but I promise you,
one day you're gonna realize

06:48.325 --> 06:50.577
that you can have
the life that you want.

06:53.371 --> 06:55.123
But in the meantime, I just hope

06:55.123 --> 06:57.792
that you get something
out of coming here.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.964
I am.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.924
That's great.

07:04.924 --> 07:07.135
Oh, yes, I'm getting something

07:07.135 --> 07:09.387
out of coming here: victims.

07:09.387 --> 07:10.889
But not these victims.

07:10.889 --> 07:12.557
Let's do our affirmations.

07:14.100 --> 07:17.395
I am enough, and I have enough.

07:17.395 --> 07:19.522
I deserve happiness.

07:19.522 --> 07:21.733
I am grateful for all that I am,

07:21.733 --> 07:24.527
and I take full charge
of my life today.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.029
They can repeat these

07:26.029 --> 07:27.906
-affirmations all they want.

07:27.906 --> 07:30.742
It'll never make
their problems go away.

07:31.534 --> 07:33.787
But I can.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.289
Now, no one's ever gonna
call me a hero,

07:36.289 --> 07:39.584
but I've come up with
a mutually beneficial solution

07:39.584 --> 07:41.711
for people like Caitlyn:

07:41.711 --> 07:47.050
get rid of their monsters
by giving mine what he needs.

07:50.553 --> 07:53.306
Hey, Doug. What are you doing
over there, buddy?

07:53.306 --> 07:54.849
There's somebody
out there, Mitch.

07:54.849 --> 07:57.018
Oh, my God, there's no one
out there, Doug!

07:57.018 --> 07:59.312
Bro, do you think
the Lobo family is gonna

07:59.312 --> 08:00.438
let us get away with this?

08:00.438 --> 08:02.357
We stole
their fucking drugs, man.

08:02.357 --> 08:04.359
I don't want to hear it, Doug!

08:06.236 --> 08:07.320
Goddamn it.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.321
-What the fuck?
-Oh, fuck.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.531
That was the best part.

08:09.531 --> 08:11.032
What the fuck, man?

08:11.032 --> 08:13.326
This is exactly why
you never set your picnic up

08:13.326 --> 08:15.120
next to a pile of dog...

08:15.120 --> 08:16.454
Shit! Okay.

08:16.454 --> 08:18.081
Hello, Mitch.

08:18.081 --> 08:20.083
Uh, look.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.543
Wait, wait, wait!

08:22.335 --> 08:25.004
Okay, hold on. I'm-I'm sorry.

08:25.004 --> 08:26.589
Okay? I'm sorry.

08:26.589 --> 08:27.882
It's too late for sorrys.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.718
You took something
you can never give back.

08:29.718 --> 08:32.595
Well, we can give it back.
That's not a problem.

08:32.595 --> 08:34.973
We'll just give it all
back to you. There it is.

08:34.973 --> 08:36.057
Go ahead.

08:36.057 --> 08:38.393
-Have it. No problem.
-Uh...

08:38.393 --> 08:39.853
-what is this?
-It's the, um...

08:39.853 --> 08:42.522
th-the drugs we stole
from your boss, sir.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.190
I'm sorry.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.859
Uh, who do you think I am?

08:45.859 --> 08:48.194
A-A hit man sent to kill us.

08:51.614 --> 08:55.076
I am something much,

08:55.076 --> 08:57.996
much worse.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.667
I'm a friend of Caitlyn.

09:05.754 --> 09:07.756
Oh, my God.

09:07.756 --> 09:10.008
Get the fuck out of here.
No, no!

09:39.078 --> 09:42.665
Wait. What did you say about
a hit man sent to kill you?

09:44.417 --> 09:46.127
Oh.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.546
Who are you?

09:48.546 --> 09:50.006
A friend of Caitlyn's.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.592
Uh, more of an acquaintance.

09:59.849 --> 10:02.185
You were smaller
from back there.

10:02.185 --> 10:03.353
Funny.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.271
Oh!

10:10.944 --> 10:12.779
Looks like you're out of knives.

10:15.490 --> 10:16.950
I was wrong.

10:26.543 --> 10:28.628
Ah.

10:28.628 --> 10:29.963
Yeah, of course
the hit is going well.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.214
I got Apache Joe on it.

10:31.214 --> 10:33.299
The man cuts out
people's tongues

10:33.299 --> 10:34.717
with a hunting knife.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.344
You tell him his name is racist.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.098
-Come on!

11:06.999 --> 11:08.668
Oh, shit.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.295
Oh, shit.

11:10.295 --> 11:12.672
Shit.

11:14.173 --> 11:15.675
What the fuck?!

11:17.719 --> 11:19.137
What the fuck?!

11:33.693 --> 11:36.529
You, uh, been drinking
tonight, sir?

11:36.529 --> 11:37.739
No.

11:37.739 --> 11:39.782
Why? You interested?

11:39.782 --> 11:41.701
All right,
get the hell out of here.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.537
Everything okay over here,
partner?

11:44.537 --> 11:45.872
Yes.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.707
Just frustrating
being on this shit detail

11:47.707 --> 11:49.375
when there's real crimes
happening out there.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.544
Drunk driving isn't real crime?

11:51.544 --> 11:53.379
You know what I mean, Chris.

11:53.379 --> 11:56.424
We got a stack of missing person
reports to follow up on.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.302
-Come on!

11:59.302 --> 12:00.970
-Holy shit, it's Teddy Lobo.
-What the fuck? Come on!

12:00.970 --> 12:03.097
-Are you sure?
-You know who I am?

12:03.097 --> 12:04.933
I'm Teddy fucking Lobo!

12:04.933 --> 12:06.434
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

12:06.434 --> 12:08.269
Don't do anything crazy,
Rebecca.

12:08.269 --> 12:09.729
I'm just doing my job.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.230
You do your job
in a very crazy way,

12:11.230 --> 12:13.191
especially when it comes
to the Lobos.

12:14.692 --> 12:16.027
Fuck.

12:17.362 --> 12:18.446
Oh, fuck.

12:19.781 --> 12:20.907
-Fuck it!

12:20.907 --> 12:22.492
Look out, Chris!

12:23.993 --> 12:26.454
Fuck a dick! Shit!

12:28.456 --> 12:30.124
Don't move! Hands on the wheel!

12:30.124 --> 12:32.585
I got a prescription
for this shit!

12:32.585 --> 12:34.295
Shit.

12:34.295 --> 12:35.880
What did I fucking do?

12:36.756 --> 12:38.424
-Is he throwing drugs at us?
-Yes!

12:38.424 --> 12:39.968
I didn't do anything wrong.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.804
Fuck. Cocaine!

12:42.804 --> 12:44.430
You can't fucking catch...

12:44.430 --> 12:46.599
Are you fucking serious?

12:53.439 --> 12:56.150
You're under arrest, bitch.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.861
Fuck.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.116
After decades of being

13:03.116 --> 13:05.827
chased away
from every corner of the globe,

13:05.827 --> 13:10.456
our options and bank account
have become a little limited.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.291
It's not exactly a castle,

13:12.291 --> 13:14.836
but it is exactly
the kind of place

13:14.836 --> 13:18.631
no one tends to notice
a convalescing monster.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.218
Master?

13:24.429 --> 13:25.763
Master.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.437
Oh, dear Jesus.

13:32.437 --> 13:34.313
Master.

13:34.313 --> 13:35.815
There you are.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.483
You're looking...

13:40.570 --> 13:43.031
...much better?

13:43.031 --> 13:44.574
Fetch me the hand.

13:44.574 --> 13:45.992
Yes. Right away.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.327
There you go.
A little amuse-bouche.

13:48.327 --> 13:49.495
Palate cleanser.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.080
-Ugh.

13:52.457 --> 13:54.500
Is that good?

13:59.672 --> 14:03.051
What is this?

14:03.885 --> 14:05.344
Uh, that...

14:05.344 --> 14:08.598
Uh, that is, uh...
that's Doug, I believe.

14:08.598 --> 14:11.059
Doug is trash!

14:11.059 --> 14:12.810
You're feeding me trash!

14:12.810 --> 14:14.062
I'm sorry, Master.

14:14.062 --> 14:15.897
This one doesn't even
have a head.

14:15.897 --> 14:17.356
Oh, no, he did have a head.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.525
You know, I don't ask
for much, Renfield.

14:19.525 --> 14:22.612
Just the blood
of a few dozen innocent people.

14:22.612 --> 14:23.988
I know. I'm sorry, Master.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.406
Let's-let's get you sat down,
and then...

14:25.406 --> 14:28.159
I want happy couples,
unsuspecting tourists,

14:28.159 --> 14:33.164
a handful of nuns, a-a...
a busload of cheerleaders.

14:33.164 --> 14:35.583
A busload of cheerleaders?

14:35.583 --> 14:37.126
A busload of cheerleaders

14:37.126 --> 14:40.213
will get me back to full power
like that.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.215
Do you mean female cheerleaders?

14:42.215 --> 14:45.635
Don't make it a sexual thing.

14:45.635 --> 14:47.720
No, no. I did not say it was.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.390
You know it's not the gender
I'm concerned with.

14:51.390 --> 14:54.852
You know, I-I'll eat boys,
I'll eat girls.

14:54.852 --> 14:56.395
It's the purity.

14:56.395 --> 14:59.899
It alone will bring me
back to...

14:59.899 --> 15:01.567
Full power.

15:02.527 --> 15:03.569
I get it, Master.

15:03.569 --> 15:06.864
You deserve better.

15:06.864 --> 15:09.700
But the modern world
is a dangerous place.

15:10.701 --> 15:13.454
Maybe if we were just
a little bit more careful,

15:13.454 --> 15:17.083
we could, you know,
stop running.

15:17.083 --> 15:20.169
You know, settle down,
and I could have...

15:21.587 --> 15:25.174
We could have a life again.

15:32.098 --> 15:35.184
It must be difficult

15:35.184 --> 15:39.480
to be caught between
their rules and mine.

15:42.150 --> 15:47.905
Their rules offer
a confusing tangle of morality,

15:47.905 --> 15:50.658
whereas mine are very simple.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.786
You can kill and eat

15:53.786 --> 15:56.747
whatever you want and never die.

15:56.747 --> 15:59.083
And it truly is a gift.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.544
And yet, you seem to think
it makes you

16:01.544 --> 16:04.046
some sort of a monster.

16:04.046 --> 16:07.300
Do you have any idea
how inconsiderate that is?

16:07.300 --> 16:09.510
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

16:09.510 --> 16:14.307
My needs are the only thing
that matters, servant.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.309
And what exactly are my needs?

16:16.309 --> 16:19.645
Um, your needs, your needs
were the, uh...

16:19.645 --> 16:25.026
uh, happy couples,
u-unsuspecting tourists, uh...

16:25.026 --> 16:28.321
nuns, nuns
and a-a busload of cheerleaders.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.823
Indeed.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.660
I suppose this is what
you'd call my health-care plan.

16:34.660 --> 16:37.371
His blood has the power
to heal the injured.

16:38.206 --> 16:40.166
And there's not even a copay.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.376
Unless you consider my soul.

16:42.376 --> 16:47.673
You will get me
exactly what I want.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.134
I cannot go to jail.

16:50.134 --> 16:51.219
I'll tell you anything
you want to know.

16:51.219 --> 16:52.094
What do you want to know?

16:52.094 --> 16:53.721
Murders! Murders.

16:53.721 --> 16:56.515
We fucking murdered so many
fucking people in cold blood.

16:56.515 --> 16:59.143
Like last night, for example,
we murdered these people

16:59.143 --> 17:01.354
for trying to steal our drugs.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.981
That's a twofer, my man.
That is a fucking twofer.

17:03.981 --> 17:06.692
Nobody's been in the room yet,
and he's already confessing.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.194
You see that?

17:08.194 --> 17:10.196
I'm gonna take down
the entire fucking Lobo empire

17:10.196 --> 17:11.948
off of one traffic stop.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.699
Put her there, partner.

17:13.699 --> 17:14.825
-Let's go.
-What?

17:14.825 --> 17:16.035
-Let's go.
-I'm out?

17:16.035 --> 17:17.745
-No. No!
-Let's go.

17:17.745 --> 17:20.164
-I didn't say a fucking thing,
by the way. -What the f...

17:20.164 --> 17:21.540
-I'm out, baby!
-What the fuck is this?

17:21.540 --> 17:23.793
Excuse me, everybody.
Guess what.

17:23.793 --> 17:25.044
Fuck you!

17:25.044 --> 17:27.421
Fuck you and you.

17:27.421 --> 17:29.382
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
What is this?

17:29.382 --> 17:31.133
He was about to give up
everything.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.760
He was ready to say anything

17:32.760 --> 17:34.720
because of the trauma
you put him through.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.430
He was already traumatized
when I found him.

17:36.430 --> 17:38.224
For crying out loud, Quincy.

17:38.224 --> 17:39.558
- -Your job is
to bust drunk drivers,

17:39.558 --> 17:41.143
not single-handedly
bring down the mob.

17:41.143 --> 17:42.561
He was running
from something, sir.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.730
And then he crashed
into a DUI checkpoint,

17:44.730 --> 17:46.232
committed ten felonies,

17:46.232 --> 17:48.276
and not to mention eff-you-ing
a room full of cops.

17:48.276 --> 17:51.153
-You eff-you me all the time.
-Fuck you, Kyle!

17:51.153 --> 17:53.072
Look, Quincy.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.159
Your father was
one of the most honest

17:57.159 --> 17:59.745
and incorruptible cops I knew.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.747
And you're a lot like him.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.958
And before he passed,
I promised your father that

18:03.958 --> 18:05.668
I would do my best
to take care of you.

18:05.668 --> 18:08.921
But sometimes, you got to know
when to play ball.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.215
This ain't your stepping stone.

18:11.215 --> 18:12.800
It's your rock bottom.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.437
What the fuck are you guys
looking at, huh?

18:37.992 --> 18:39.493
Shit.

18:41.329 --> 18:43.372
What'd you do this time?

18:45.249 --> 18:47.126
What I do every time.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.128
Catch Teddy Lobo
committing a crime, and then:

18:49.128 --> 18:51.714
What? Oh, surprise,
he got away with it again.

18:51.714 --> 18:54.633
And what about your-your little
FBI, uh, task force up there?

18:54.633 --> 18:56.302
You guys been back
for four months.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.095
What have you done
about the Lobos?

18:58.095 --> 18:59.972
Oh, oh, oh, a-a wiretap?

18:59.972 --> 19:01.390
Subpoena?
A fucking parking ticket?

19:01.390 --> 19:04.018
A hard stare across a diner?

19:04.018 --> 19:07.313
I am just as mad about
what they did to Dad as you are.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.857
I want revenge
just as bad as you do.

19:09.857 --> 19:12.485
But every day, I force myself
to swallow that anger

19:12.485 --> 19:14.820
so I don't fuck up
my investigation.

19:14.820 --> 19:18.157
And if you cannot learn
to let that go...

19:19.325 --> 19:21.535
...you're never gonna get
the justice that you want.

19:24.497 --> 19:27.458

You said you wanted to see me?

20:06.455 --> 20:08.916
Take a seat, please.

20:14.422 --> 20:18.217
Do you even know why we became

20:18.217 --> 20:22.263
the most powerful crime family
in this city?

20:22.263 --> 20:25.224
We're not the biggest.
We're not the richest.

20:25.224 --> 20:29.728
However, we are the most feared.

20:29.728 --> 20:33.315
Our reputation for
ruthlessness and violence

20:33.315 --> 20:36.902
is something I have worked
very hard to cultivate.

20:36.902 --> 20:39.905
But lately,
our enemies don't seem to be

20:39.905 --> 20:41.532
as afraid as they used to be.

20:41.532 --> 20:43.742
They're fucking scared, Mom.

20:43.742 --> 20:48.289
Not the two-bit punks
stealing our drugs.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.584
Not the five families.

20:52.460 --> 20:55.629
And not
that fucking traffic cop.

20:55.629 --> 20:59.341
This family is an empire, Teddy.

20:59.341 --> 21:04.263
I built an empire.

21:05.389 --> 21:08.309
And I need to know
its future is secure.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.857
I need to know
whose hands it belongs in.

21:14.857 --> 21:20.279
And I need to know those hands
can get a little dirty.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.656
I know Teddy's up to something.

21:23.949 --> 21:26.619
I'm gonna find the evidence
to make it stick.

21:26.619 --> 21:29.038
Got a lot of orange paint.

21:32.833 --> 21:35.628
What is that?
Some kind of warning?

21:37.630 --> 21:39.715
I think it's lyrics
to a ska song.

21:41.175 --> 21:43.636

22:20.381 --> 22:22.132
I think we'll get dinner.

22:22.132 --> 22:24.343
Maybe answers for dessert.

22:25.135 --> 22:26.512
There she is.

22:26.512 --> 22:28.514
You sure you want
to do this, Teddy?

22:28.514 --> 22:30.558
Yes, I am sure
I want to do this.

22:30.558 --> 22:32.643
That cop needs to be reminded
who runs this town.

22:56.875 --> 22:58.502
Oh, shit.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.421
Fuck.

23:00.421 --> 23:02.506
Oh, this is not a good look.

23:02.506 --> 23:04.216
Not a good look at all.
Abort. Abort.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.051
Can you order me a number three?

23:06.051 --> 23:08.596
The toilet just ordered
a number two.

23:17.313 --> 23:19.690
Sorry.

23:24.987 --> 23:27.323
Who the fuck are these guys?

23:38.375 --> 23:41.462
Move, and I'll blow
your fucking head off.

23:42.963 --> 23:44.715
-Take that, tourist!

23:47.343 --> 23:49.094
Get down!

23:50.095 --> 23:51.430
Hey, do me a favor.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.682
Just remain calm,

23:53.682 --> 23:58.062
and almost nobody will get hurt.

23:58.062 --> 23:59.480
Thank you, Teddy.

23:59.480 --> 24:01.273
I came here to connect you
to a crime scene,

24:01.273 --> 24:02.858
and you go and turn it into one.

24:06.195 --> 24:08.072
What you trying to do?

24:08.072 --> 24:10.616
Holy shit, were you trying
to imitate your dad?

24:10.616 --> 24:14.453
What do you think,
your dad died some brave hero?

24:14.453 --> 24:16.622
We beat the shit
out of your father.

24:16.622 --> 24:19.458
And while he was lying there
on the floor,

24:19.458 --> 24:21.502
he begged for his life.

24:21.502 --> 24:23.337
Your dad was a coward.

24:23.337 --> 24:26.465
But you know what? I want to
save you that embarrassment.

24:26.465 --> 24:29.009
I'm gonna give you
the chance to live.

24:30.135 --> 24:34.056
All you have to do
is admit to everybody here

24:34.056 --> 24:36.600
that we own you, too.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.185
So, what's it gonna be?

24:38.185 --> 24:39.186
Shoot me.

24:39.186 --> 24:40.312
What?

24:40.312 --> 24:41.814
You heard me, asshole.

24:41.814 --> 24:42.856
Shoot me.

24:42.856 --> 24:44.983
Shoot me like you shot my dad.

24:44.983 --> 24:47.277
Or was that not you?

24:47.277 --> 24:48.654
Were you waiting in the car

24:48.654 --> 24:50.656
while one of your boys
did it for you?

24:52.032 --> 24:53.492
I'm more than happy
to do it, Teddy.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.868
Shut the fuck up.

24:55.703 --> 24:57.913
Have you ever shot
someone before?

24:57.913 --> 24:59.748
I've shot
a million fucking people.

24:59.748 --> 25:01.583
Then add me to the list.

25:01.583 --> 25:03.001
Come on, tough guy. Shoot me.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.628
If you think
this is a fucking game,

25:04.628 --> 25:06.213
I will shoot you
in your fucking face.

25:06.213 --> 25:08.674
-Yeah? Dare you.

25:10.676 --> 25:14.012
You want to be
a fucking hero right now?

25:14.012 --> 25:15.556
Okay, fine.

25:15.556 --> 25:17.683
Here we go.

25:18.475 --> 25:20.060
Congratulations.

25:22.771 --> 25:24.565
You're better than your father.

26:27.336 --> 26:29.254
Fuck! Shit!

26:51.276 --> 26:52.903
-Oh.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.324
Are you okay?

26:57.324 --> 26:58.575
Yeah. Yeah. Oh...

26:58.575 --> 27:00.160
That was amazing.
You were amazing.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.787
What you did.

27:01.787 --> 27:03.914
You stood up to him.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.583
How did you do that?

27:06.583 --> 27:07.918
What kind of life would I lead

27:07.918 --> 27:09.628
under the thumb
of one of those assholes?

27:09.628 --> 27:13.215
A very... a very sad one.

27:13.215 --> 27:14.466
Yeah.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.134
Did I watch you
cut a guy's arms off

27:16.134 --> 27:17.636
with a decorative
serving platter?

27:17.636 --> 27:20.180
Oh, uh, y-yeah.

27:20.180 --> 27:21.431
That was adrenaline.

27:21.431 --> 27:23.642
Uh, it was awesome.

27:25.853 --> 27:27.980
Um, I-I'm-I'm Rebecca Quincy.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.606
Officer... Officer Quincy.

27:29.606 --> 27:32.442
Robert Montague Renfield.

27:32.442 --> 27:34.611
Oh, uh, Montague. Cool.

27:34.611 --> 27:36.321
Are you from around here or...

27:36.321 --> 27:38.490
Oh, no. I'm...

27:38.490 --> 27:40.325
Uh, everywhere.

27:40.325 --> 27:41.910
Ah, military.

27:41.910 --> 27:44.204
That-that would explain
all the moves.

27:44.204 --> 27:47.708
Yeah, but forever ago--
the Great War.

27:47.708 --> 27:49.918
Uh... Iraq.

27:49.918 --> 27:51.336
Maybe not great, uh, you know,

27:51.336 --> 27:53.463
but overall pretty good--
three out of five stars.

27:53.463 --> 27:54.840
I'm sorry.

27:54.840 --> 27:58.677
I don't mean to interrupt
whatever this is,

27:58.677 --> 28:00.470
but...

28:00.470 --> 28:02.431
can we get up now?

28:02.431 --> 28:04.182
Uh, yeah.

28:04.182 --> 28:06.059
If I could have everyone
please, uh,

28:06.059 --> 28:08.145
just line up for me
for witness statements.

28:08.145 --> 28:10.647
And if we could all thank
Mr. Renfield

28:10.647 --> 28:13.650
for his brave, uh,
efforts today.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.277
Thank you, Mr. Renfield.

28:15.277 --> 28:17.195
You are the man, Mr. Renfield.

28:17.195 --> 28:19.323
And, um, thank you.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.409
Y-You... you saved my life.

28:22.409 --> 28:24.703
I...

28:24.703 --> 28:26.914
saved a life?

28:27.789 --> 28:29.833
You saved all our lives.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.545
You must really not be
from around here,

28:33.545 --> 28:36.673
'cause we certainly don't see
your kind very often.

28:36.673 --> 28:38.592
I'm sorry, what kind is that?

28:38.592 --> 28:40.844
Heroes.

28:44.556 --> 28:46.391
Hmm.

28:49.811 --> 28:52.898
Wow. That was amazing.

28:52.898 --> 28:55.901
She is amazing.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.236
And she saw me.

28:58.236 --> 29:00.697
She really saw me.

29:00.697 --> 29:03.283
That hasn't happened in ages.

29:03.283 --> 29:05.327
I'd forgotten
what it feels like.

29:05.327 --> 29:07.454
-Maybe there is hope.
-Oh, God bless you.

29:07.454 --> 29:08.747
Maybe she can...

29:08.747 --> 29:10.457
Renfield.

29:10.457 --> 29:13.669
What are you doing?

29:13.669 --> 29:16.088
Get here now.

29:16.088 --> 29:17.923
Ah, fuck.

29:17.923 --> 29:20.050
Do you think it's too late
to grab one of those nuns?

29:22.928 --> 29:26.139
What did we talk about
yesterday?

29:26.139 --> 29:27.265
U-Um...

29:27.265 --> 29:30.936
I've been up all day
thinking about it.

29:30.936 --> 29:33.563
Oh. What's this?

29:33.563 --> 29:36.024
Ah. My plan.

29:36.024 --> 29:37.609
Your plan?

29:37.609 --> 29:40.570
But your plan has always been
to just drink blood.

29:40.570 --> 29:42.030
Exactly.

29:42.030 --> 29:44.533
What have I been doing
all these years?

29:44.533 --> 29:47.953
I mean, look at me,
lurking in the shadows and filth

29:47.953 --> 29:50.038
like some kind
of a diseased animal.

29:50.038 --> 29:52.082
You said it yourself--
I deserve better.

29:52.082 --> 29:57.504
So, why am I not embracing
what I truly am?

29:58.505 --> 29:59.798
Which is?

30:00.590 --> 30:04.011
A god, Renfield.

30:04.011 --> 30:07.806
An immortal, insatiable--

30:07.806 --> 30:11.393
whoo!-- all-powerful being.

30:11.393 --> 30:14.312
Everything you said about
the modern world is true.

30:14.312 --> 30:18.233
-It is a dangerous place.
-Hmm.

30:18.233 --> 30:20.485
Only not for us.

30:20.485 --> 30:25.198
For them, it's a dangerous,
sad, broken place

30:25.198 --> 30:27.701
full of fear and desperation.

30:27.701 --> 30:29.202
It's weak.

30:29.202 --> 30:32.748
Longing for a powerful force
to guide it,

30:32.748 --> 30:37.711
control it, dominate it.

30:37.711 --> 30:39.546
-Like you.
-Hmm.

30:39.546 --> 30:44.009
I mean, this entire society
was designed by Renfields,

30:44.009 --> 30:45.844
for Renfields.

30:45.844 --> 30:49.806
So, why should I
have to adapt to it?

30:49.806 --> 30:52.893
It should have to adapt to me.

30:54.227 --> 30:56.354
-I owe it all to you, servant.
-Oh, no.

30:56.354 --> 30:58.231
I think you actually might have
read between the lines

30:58.231 --> 30:59.691
-a little bit there.
-Indeed.

30:59.691 --> 31:01.818
We're in this together,

31:01.818 --> 31:03.945
Dracula and Renfield.

31:05.030 --> 31:07.574
From now on, humanity
will no longer be divided

31:07.574 --> 31:10.035
by the good and the evil,

31:10.035 --> 31:14.206
only by followers...

31:14.206 --> 31:16.625
and food.

31:20.253 --> 31:24.800
You and I forever,
until the end of time.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.927
Bloody hell.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.388
How is my life?

31:30.388 --> 31:32.557
My life is like a...

31:32.557 --> 31:37.104
never-ending hallway
of fun house mirrors, but...

31:37.104 --> 31:39.397
all the clowns are me.

31:39.397 --> 31:40.899
Uh, hey, everyone.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.901
I need your help.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.069
Are you okay?

31:44.069 --> 31:45.904
No.

31:47.072 --> 31:49.741
I need to get out
of a toxic relationship.

31:49.741 --> 31:53.662
Okay. Well, well, well, well,
take a seat and let her rip.

31:53.662 --> 31:55.247
Okay, thanks.

31:55.247 --> 31:57.249
Okay, yeah. Fuck Carol, I guess.

31:57.249 --> 31:58.708
It's...

31:58.708 --> 32:00.252
I hate her, too.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.170
Why don't you start
by telling us

32:02.170 --> 32:04.089
what brought you here
in the first place.

32:04.089 --> 32:06.007
I was on the job.

32:06.007 --> 32:07.634
Uh, for my boss.

32:07.634 --> 32:09.845
Uh, well, and I was
actually following Bob,

32:09.845 --> 32:11.888
because I thought
that Bob would make

32:11.888 --> 32:13.932
a very good, um, uh...

32:15.517 --> 32:17.018
Friend?

32:17.853 --> 32:19.729
Yes. Thank you, Bob.

32:19.729 --> 32:20.981
Thank you, Renfield.

32:20.981 --> 32:23.650
And then, you know,
I started to hear

32:23.650 --> 32:27.529
all of your stories and...

32:31.158 --> 32:34.286
I mean, they were all so sad.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.247
That's us.

32:37.247 --> 32:42.169
And, you know,
for the first time in years,

32:42.169 --> 32:44.171
I felt like I wasn't alone.

32:45.130 --> 32:47.382
-You realized you're
a codependent. -Mm-hmm.

32:47.382 --> 32:49.634
I need to change. I can see
that I-I need to change,

32:49.634 --> 32:52.304
and, uh, I want to, but my boss,

32:52.304 --> 32:54.055
he's pretty delusional, I think.

32:54.055 --> 32:56.683
Uh, he thinks
he can take over the world.

32:56.683 --> 32:59.269
-He's a narcissist, Renfield.

32:59.269 --> 33:00.645
We all know exactly
how you feel.

33:00.645 --> 33:01.771
-Yes.
-Exactly.

33:01.771 --> 33:03.356
No, he's different.

33:03.356 --> 33:05.358
-You can't get him
out of your head. -No.

33:05.358 --> 33:06.860
Ooh, and you feel like
he could kill you

33:06.860 --> 33:08.236
with the snap of his fingers.

33:08.236 --> 33:10.113
-Yes. Wouldn't even
need to snap. -Oh.

33:10.113 --> 33:12.657
He controls rats with his mind.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.034
Uh...

33:14.034 --> 33:15.202
It's okay, it's okay.
He's on medication.

33:15.202 --> 33:19.247
Renfield, this is
codependency 101.

33:19.247 --> 33:21.249
A narcissist will take
full advantage

33:21.249 --> 33:23.293
of a codependent's
low self-esteem,

33:23.293 --> 33:27.839
but you're the one
with the real power.

33:27.839 --> 33:31.176
And all you got to do
is take it back.

33:31.176 --> 33:32.677
How do I do that?

33:32.677 --> 33:35.263
Focus on your needs.

33:35.263 --> 33:38.141
I mean, I just haven't
thought about

33:38.141 --> 33:39.935
any of my needs in years.

33:39.935 --> 33:42.812
But if you were to stop focusing
on his needs, what would happen?

33:42.812 --> 33:44.856
If I don't...

33:44.856 --> 33:45.857
Yeah, what would happen?

33:45.857 --> 33:47.067
Stop focusing on his needs.

33:47.067 --> 33:48.652
What would happen?

33:48.652 --> 33:50.320
-He won't grow to full power.

33:50.320 --> 33:52.697
Exactly.
He won't grow to full power.

33:52.697 --> 33:54.241
What? That's so weird.

33:54.241 --> 33:56.034
Why would you phrase it
like that?

33:56.034 --> 33:58.119
But yes, he's right.

33:58.119 --> 33:59.829
He's absolutely right.

33:59.829 --> 34:01.581
He won't grow to full power.

34:01.581 --> 34:04.417
You can take all that energy
you've spent on him

34:04.417 --> 34:06.336
and put it toward yourself.

34:06.336 --> 34:11.758
And then you will be the one
who grows to full power.

34:11.758 --> 34:13.260
-Yes.
-Full power.

34:13.260 --> 34:14.970
Me grow...
I-I'm gonna grow to full power?

34:14.970 --> 34:16.972
I want to hear you say it.

34:16.972 --> 34:19.140
Say, "I'm gonna grow
to full power."

34:19.140 --> 34:21.226
I-I-I'm gonna grow
to full power.

34:21.226 --> 34:23.645
I heard you say it,
but I didn't believe you.

34:23.645 --> 34:25.605
-Nope.
-Let me hear you say it again.

34:25.605 --> 34:27.732
-I'm gonna grow to full power.
-Yes!

34:27.732 --> 34:29.567
I see a smile there
because you like it.

34:29.567 --> 34:31.903
Now, say it like
the world needs to hear it.

34:31.903 --> 34:34.572
I'm gonna grow to full power.

34:34.572 --> 34:35.490
There you go!

34:37.117 --> 34:38.702
-Yes!
-That guy who walks

34:38.702 --> 34:41.413
in here every single week,
say goodbye to him.

34:41.413 --> 34:44.749

-Yeah.

35:39.304 --> 35:42.265
You would think
that attacking a police officer

35:42.265 --> 35:43.975
in front of a bunch of witnesses

35:43.975 --> 35:47.604
at a restaurant would be enough
to put Teddy Lobo behind bars.

35:47.604 --> 35:50.565
You guys don't think I know
what's going on here, huh?

35:50.565 --> 35:52.150
I don't know
how many of you assholes

35:52.150 --> 35:53.651
are on the Lobos' payroll,

35:53.651 --> 35:55.820
but there's only so much
evidence you can tamper with

35:55.820 --> 35:57.822
and so many witnesses
you can intimidate.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.366
All right? Because eventually,

35:59.366 --> 36:01.576
someone brave enough
is going to step forward,

36:01.576 --> 36:03.995
and they're going to help me
take down the Lobos

36:03.995 --> 36:05.872
and all of you motherfuckers!

36:05.872 --> 36:07.999
Permanently! Permanently!

36:11.795 --> 36:13.254
Mr. Renfield?

36:13.254 --> 36:18.676
Robert Montague Renfield,
yes, at your service.

36:18.676 --> 36:21.221
You look different.

36:21.221 --> 36:23.264
-Oh.
-Good different.

36:23.264 --> 36:24.849
I really like your sweater.

36:24.849 --> 36:26.267
Oh, thank you.

36:26.267 --> 36:28.436
-I went to Macy's.
-Oh.

36:28.436 --> 36:30.855
Um, I'm here to give
my witness statement.

36:30.855 --> 36:33.316
You always bring flowers
to give a witness statement?

36:34.609 --> 36:37.404
Yeah, uh, well,
th-they're for everyone.

36:37.404 --> 36:39.531
-They're for everyone.
-Everyone.

36:39.531 --> 36:42.450
Do you, um...
Probably put it in some water.

36:43.243 --> 36:45.870
And the rest are for you.

36:45.870 --> 36:48.206
-Thank you.
-Yeah. Pleasure.

36:48.206 --> 36:50.041
Rebecca, is this your boyfriend?

36:50.041 --> 36:52.335
Shut the fuck up, Kyle!

36:52.335 --> 36:55.213
Thank you for coming in,
Mr. Renfield.

36:56.047 --> 36:58.007
It really means a lot.

36:58.925 --> 37:02.178
Yeah, it means a lot
that I can actually

37:02.178 --> 37:04.722
do the right thing, for once.

37:04.722 --> 37:08.726
Well, if I could just stress
how appreciative I am

37:08.726 --> 37:13.189
that you're here, uh,
because without you,

37:13.189 --> 37:14.983
-I think I'd be a bit lost.
-No.

37:14.983 --> 37:18.653
You stood up for everyone
who's ever lived in fear

37:18.653 --> 37:21.823
of the powerful forces
shaping their lives.

37:21.823 --> 37:24.409
Okay? And you need
to keep doing that,

37:24.409 --> 37:26.911
because when
people like you stop

37:26.911 --> 37:29.622
standing up to people like them,

37:29.622 --> 37:31.916
that's when
the monsters take over.

37:32.876 --> 37:35.378
So...

37:36.963 --> 37:38.882
You are not lost.

37:40.091 --> 37:42.802
You're an inspiration.

37:42.802 --> 37:45.638
Thank you, Mr. Renfield.

37:45.638 --> 37:47.223
It's Robert.

37:47.223 --> 37:49.184
Robert.

37:49.184 --> 37:51.394
This is the same prick

37:51.394 --> 37:53.980
who took out everyone
in the restaurant.

37:53.980 --> 37:55.607
Who does he work for?

37:55.607 --> 37:58.276
-The five fucking families?
-I-I don't know.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.236
But we've hacked into
the NSA's Eye in the Sky,

38:00.236 --> 38:01.779
and we can track him

38:01.779 --> 38:03.448
using all these other cameras
throughout the city.

38:03.448 --> 38:05.074
Yes, I can get you access
to whatever you want.

38:05.074 --> 38:06.618
Yeah, and then we enhance.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.328
-We got a trace on him.
-Boom!

38:08.328 --> 38:10.747
We did it.
Now we can track his every move.

38:11.748 --> 38:14.292
His last known location
is at the old charity hospital.

38:14.292 --> 38:17.003
You have until the end of the
day to find him and kill him.

38:17.003 --> 38:19.297
Give me ten minutes.

38:20.256 --> 38:21.633
I'll take the end of the day.

38:22.967 --> 38:25.929
Can you run the DNA on this pen
through the Bureau's database?

38:25.929 --> 38:27.555
And Interpol.

38:27.555 --> 38:31.017
I can't trust this with anyone
who works in my department.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.354
This pen was found
near a location

38:34.354 --> 38:37.023
where these three guys
went missing.

38:37.023 --> 38:39.400
Teddy Lobo was fleeing
from the same location

38:39.400 --> 38:40.985
when I arrested him.

38:40.985 --> 38:42.320
Huh.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.989
Word on the street is
these are the three guys

38:44.989 --> 38:47.825
who allegedly stole drugs
from the Lobos.

38:47.825 --> 38:48.701
Right.

38:48.701 --> 38:50.912
And the DNA evidence on this pen

38:50.912 --> 38:54.791
just might connect Teddy Lobo
to that crime scene.

38:54.791 --> 38:57.961
Maybe it's a long shot,
but I got to try.

38:59.462 --> 39:04.008
Look, I know I-I haven't
handled anything well

39:04.008 --> 39:07.387
since Dad, um...

39:07.387 --> 39:09.806
but I really need your help.

39:11.182 --> 39:13.059
Can you run this pen?

39:13.059 --> 39:15.019
Please.

39:34.872 --> 39:36.666
Let's go. Come on.

39:58.062 --> 40:00.398
What the fuck?

40:30.178 --> 40:34.015
Holy fucking shit.

40:34.015 --> 40:35.933
Ronnie, call my mom!

40:35.933 --> 40:37.018
I'm on it.

40:37.018 --> 40:39.103
Ronnie, call my fucking mom!

40:44.192 --> 40:45.902
Hello, Ronnie?

40:47.403 --> 40:49.614
Ronnie, is this
another butt dial?

40:49.614 --> 40:52.283
Did you guys fucking bail?
Hello?

40:52.283 --> 40:54.285
-Guys?
-Teddy.

40:54.285 --> 40:56.287
-What the fuck? Mom.
-Teddy.

40:56.287 --> 40:57.789
Mom?

40:58.748 --> 40:59.832
Teddy?

40:59.832 --> 41:01.292
Do you know who the fuck I am?

41:01.292 --> 41:03.878
-Teddy?
-I'm Teddy fucking Lobo.

41:05.296 --> 41:07.965
-I am Count Dracula.

41:07.965 --> 41:09.008
You win.

41:10.385 --> 41:11.803
Who are you?

41:13.388 --> 41:14.972
You were sent by the church?

41:14.972 --> 41:16.057
Church? No.

41:16.057 --> 41:17.308
What are you fucking
talking about?

41:17.308 --> 41:18.601
I'm a criminal.

41:18.601 --> 41:21.312
My whole organization
is about evil.

41:21.312 --> 41:23.022
Evil. Oh, fuck.

41:24.023 --> 41:25.316
Dude.

41:25.316 --> 41:26.609
Why are you here?

41:26.609 --> 41:27.652
I'm here because
I want to find this guy!

41:27.652 --> 41:28.986
I'm trying to find this guy.

41:28.986 --> 41:31.155
He stuck his nose
in our family business

41:31.155 --> 41:33.074
and killed some of our guys

41:33.074 --> 41:35.076
trying to save
a bunch of innocent people.

41:35.076 --> 41:37.662
So, what is he,
like, your fucking roommate?

41:37.662 --> 41:40.081
He's my servant.

41:40.081 --> 41:42.500
He doesn't seem
to be serving you very well.

41:48.047 --> 41:50.007
You've reached Officer Quincy.

41:50.007 --> 41:52.009
Please state your emergency
at the sound of the beep.

41:52.009 --> 41:53.928
-Uh, hi, Rebecca.

41:53.928 --> 41:56.097
It's not an emergency.
It-it's me, Robert.

41:56.097 --> 41:59.809
What, uh, I was trying
to ask was, um,

41:59.809 --> 42:02.437
maybe you'd like
to get a bite to eat...

42:02.437 --> 42:04.814
Hello, Renfield.

42:04.814 --> 42:06.691
I've been expecting you.

42:06.691 --> 42:08.526
Please, come in.

42:08.526 --> 42:10.236
Close the door.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.533
Shit.

42:16.743 --> 42:20.037
Marvelous attire.

42:20.037 --> 42:21.831
Very colorful.

42:21.831 --> 42:24.834
You look like the sort of boy
who has to fight 'em off.

42:26.753 --> 42:29.964
So, I suppose that's a no

42:29.964 --> 42:33.259
as to you bringing me
my dinner tonight, hmm?

42:33.259 --> 42:34.719
-A no? No.
-No?

42:34.719 --> 42:36.345
No, not a no.

42:36.345 --> 42:38.431
-No, not no?
-Uh, yes.

42:39.557 --> 42:41.434
Big yes to dinner.

42:41.434 --> 42:43.978
Ooh. Um, a feast.
A full feast, Master.

42:43.978 --> 42:45.730
In fact,
I'm so glad you're here.

42:45.730 --> 42:49.400
Um, I was actually, um...
I was on my way to see you.

42:49.400 --> 42:50.902
Oh, you were on your way.

42:50.902 --> 42:54.113
Yes, but I had, um,
too many bodies.

42:54.113 --> 42:56.240
-Oh, you-you have bodies, huh?
-Yeah, too... too many.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.868
Well, uh, so many bodies, um,
that I couldn't carry them all.

42:58.868 --> 43:00.411
-Uh, you should have seen it.
-Mm. Mm-hmm.

43:00.411 --> 43:02.955
The problem is my back
has really been playing up.

43:02.955 --> 43:05.458
Anyway, the-the plan is
to rent a U-Haul, and that way,

43:05.458 --> 43:07.418
-I'll be able to get all
the bodies... -Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

43:07.418 --> 43:10.004
You know what? It's so silly,
but you don't have to worry,

43:10.004 --> 43:13.174
um, and I-I won't bother you
with my-my problems.

43:13.174 --> 43:14.842
No, no.

43:14.842 --> 43:18.763
Please, tell me
all about your problems.

43:18.763 --> 43:23.601
Tell me all about
the gun-wielding criminals

43:23.601 --> 43:25.478
who came after you
for killing their men

43:25.478 --> 43:31.025
because you were protecting
so-called innocent people.

43:31.776 --> 43:33.986
I'm-I'm sorry.

43:33.986 --> 43:36.614
I'm sorry, Master.
I never meant to hurt you.

43:36.614 --> 43:39.283
Hurt me?

43:39.283 --> 43:41.285
Are you actually suggesting

43:41.285 --> 43:45.331
that anything you could do
would hurt...

43:45.331 --> 43:46.958
me?!

43:46.958 --> 43:48.709
No. No, no, no, no, no.
No, Master, I'm sorry.

43:48.709 --> 43:50.127
I didn't mean...
I didn't mean that.

43:50.127 --> 43:51.420
No, no, it's-it's all right.
It's all right.

43:51.420 --> 43:52.755
-Really?
-No, it's... Yeah.

43:52.755 --> 43:54.131
Let me explain
something to you, okay?

43:54.131 --> 43:56.926
-Okay.
-I was wrong about you.

43:56.926 --> 44:00.471
I should've realized
what you were capable of

44:00.471 --> 44:02.849
when you were so eager
to join me.

44:02.849 --> 44:04.684
I-I don't think I was eager.

44:04.684 --> 44:06.060
I think that you caught me
at a low moment

44:06.060 --> 44:07.645
-and you maybe manipulated me,
too. -No, no, no,

44:07.645 --> 44:09.438
-no, no... -And you just
caught me at a low moment

44:09.438 --> 44:11.482
-and used some of your power...
-...no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

44:11.482 --> 44:14.569
I use my power
for a lot of things,

44:14.569 --> 44:16.529
but I didn't need
to use it on you.

44:16.529 --> 44:18.906
You were a lawyer
who wanted to get rich

44:18.906 --> 44:20.950
off a real estate deal.

44:20.950 --> 44:22.827
You're the one who used me!

44:22.827 --> 44:26.831
You used my power
because you're a husk.

44:26.831 --> 44:30.126
An empty void
that nothing can fill.

44:30.126 --> 44:34.839
The only thing that gave your
life any meaning was my power.

44:34.839 --> 44:37.967
The power you used
to bring me victims

44:37.967 --> 44:40.428
while you pretended
to be one yourself.

44:41.637 --> 44:45.182
However,
I'm the real victim here!

44:45.182 --> 44:48.936
I'm the one
you swore to protect!

44:50.313 --> 44:52.356
And you...

44:52.356 --> 44:54.150
abandoned me!

44:55.151 --> 44:56.569
No.

44:56.569 --> 44:58.362
That's not true.

44:58.362 --> 45:01.741
Just like you abandoned

45:01.741 --> 45:05.411
your wife and your daughter.

45:07.747 --> 45:09.498
That's not... I didn't...

45:09.498 --> 45:11.042
I didn't abandon them.

45:11.042 --> 45:14.754
Look into your own eyes,
Renfield.

45:14.754 --> 45:19.091
You're the monster, Renfield,
not me.

45:22.803 --> 45:24.722
It's you.

45:25.514 --> 45:27.850
No. No.

45:27.850 --> 45:31.312
That's enough. That's enough.

45:36.484 --> 45:37.526
What?

45:42.073 --> 45:44.408
I will no longer tolerate abuse.

45:46.285 --> 45:47.745
Stop laughing.

45:47.745 --> 45:49.246
I deserve love.

45:50.247 --> 45:51.666
I deserve happiness.

45:51.666 --> 45:53.960
You deserve only suffering.

45:55.086 --> 45:58.422
Um, oh. I know being undead,
it's a painful existence--

45:58.422 --> 46:00.925
it is-- and I empathize
with your pain.

46:00.925 --> 46:02.551
Oh, please. Illuminate me.

46:02.551 --> 46:03.928
Let me learn from you.

46:03.928 --> 46:07.598
I will find everyone
you have ever loved,

46:07.598 --> 46:09.934
and I will drain them.

46:09.934 --> 46:13.312
-I will reduce this... this...
-S-Studio apartment?

46:13.312 --> 46:16.732
...studio apartment
until it's ash!

46:16.732 --> 46:19.527
Uh... uh...

46:21.529 --> 46:23.322
Affirmations, affirmations.

46:23.322 --> 46:26.867
Uh, I'm enough, and, um,
I deserve some happiness.

46:26.867 --> 46:29.245
There is some other stuff
that I have to say.

46:29.245 --> 46:32.289
Who put these ideas
in your head?

46:38.462 --> 46:40.214
Of course.

46:45.094 --> 46:46.429
What?

46:52.226 --> 46:53.811
Shit.

46:55.521 --> 46:58.691
You think Doug was murdered?

46:58.691 --> 47:01.193
I can't say for sure, but I...

47:01.193 --> 47:04.155
I hope he was fucking murdered.

47:04.155 --> 47:08.284
I hope he was torn to
itty-bitty pieces and then...

47:08.284 --> 47:11.996
I shouldn't be saying that
to a cop, right?

47:11.996 --> 47:14.415
Karla, margaritas are ready!

47:14.415 --> 47:16.584
Caitlyn! Oh, God. This...

47:16.584 --> 47:17.752
Try this.

47:17.752 --> 47:18.878
Are you Caitlyn Berggren?

47:18.878 --> 47:20.504
I can be anybody I want now.

47:20.504 --> 47:22.173
That's right. Yes, you can.

47:22.173 --> 47:25.051
Did you file a missing persons
report for Mitch Flaherty?

47:25.051 --> 47:26.969
-Maybe.
-Are you Caitlyn?

47:26.969 --> 47:28.554
H-How do you two
know each other?

47:28.554 --> 47:31.348
-Um, from this support group
thing. -

47:31.348 --> 47:34.060
Uh, for people addicted
to assholes.

47:35.436 --> 47:37.563
-Assholes Anonymous.

47:37.563 --> 47:40.024
At the Livespring Church.

47:40.024 --> 47:44.195
I realized that
I can identify healthy love.

47:44.195 --> 47:47.448
I just don't think I deserve it.

47:47.448 --> 47:49.658
Um, and that's partially
the shame talking,

47:49.658 --> 47:50.868
but also the rash...

47:50.868 --> 47:52.244
Renfield?

47:52.244 --> 47:54.789
Can I get through
one fucking share, please?

47:54.789 --> 47:56.499
Is, uh... is everyone okay?

47:56.499 --> 47:58.167
-If that's what you want to
call it. -MARK: We're all fine.

47:58.167 --> 48:00.002
-What's going on?
What's going on? -We, uh...

48:00.002 --> 48:01.420
We need to leave. Now.

48:01.420 --> 48:03.255
I mean, where's the rule
that says we have to talk

48:03.255 --> 48:05.049
about our feelings in a gym?
Come on, please.

48:05.049 --> 48:07.343
Up. Up. Let's go somewhere safe
till morning.

48:07.343 --> 48:08.886
Come on, up.
Everybody, move. Come on.

48:08.886 --> 48:10.221
Renfield,
just take a deep breath.

48:10.221 --> 48:12.223
We are all fine. I promise...

48:12.223 --> 48:14.100
Mark, we need to leave now.

48:14.100 --> 48:15.893
-All right...

48:18.437 --> 48:22.650
Hi. Uh, are you here
for the meeting?

48:22.650 --> 48:23.984
Well, come on in.

48:23.984 --> 48:26.445
No! No! No!

48:45.089 --> 48:49.468
You can leave your top hat
and cane by the door.

48:50.469 --> 48:51.929
Renfield.

48:53.681 --> 48:57.143
I'm...

48:57.143 --> 48:59.603
feeling much better.

49:03.274 --> 49:04.650
Don't.

49:04.650 --> 49:08.112
Would you like to introduce
yourself to the group?

49:09.780 --> 49:12.158
I'm the prince of Wallachia.

49:16.996 --> 49:20.332
Some call me the Dark One.

49:21.876 --> 49:24.628
Others, the Lord of Death.

49:29.133 --> 49:33.888
However, to most,

49:33.888 --> 49:37.349
I am known simply as...

49:37.349 --> 49:39.643
-Renfield's boss!

49:51.989 --> 49:55.242
I am Dracula.

49:55.242 --> 49:57.244
Okay.
Obviously, we're dealing with

49:57.244 --> 49:59.330
a little bit more than
just narcissism here.

49:59.330 --> 50:00.748
Master.

50:00.748 --> 50:02.041
Please.

50:02.041 --> 50:04.210
I should never
have forsaken you.

50:10.007 --> 50:13.093
You could've had everything.

50:13.093 --> 50:15.221
I gave you the choice between

50:15.221 --> 50:18.265
the power of a god

50:18.265 --> 50:22.519
and the pathetic desperation
of humanity.

50:24.396 --> 50:26.190
Why?

50:26.190 --> 50:29.526
Why would you choose this?

50:29.526 --> 50:31.570
Because...

50:33.280 --> 50:35.783
...that's what I am.

50:38.577 --> 50:41.080
Master, please.

50:41.080 --> 50:42.790
These are good people.

50:42.790 --> 50:47.336
Good. You've finally brought me
what I've been asking for.

50:48.963 --> 50:50.005
Let's eat.

50:50.005 --> 50:52.758
Please. Please. No.

50:52.758 --> 50:53.884
No!

50:55.886 --> 50:57.554
Please, Dracula!

51:25.416 --> 51:26.417
No.

51:27.918 --> 51:31.130
Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry.

51:33.882 --> 51:37.761
There are some experiences

51:37.761 --> 51:40.472
worse than death, Renfield.

51:42.599 --> 51:45.936
Such as spending
the remaining years

51:45.936 --> 51:49.106
of your miserable life

51:49.106 --> 51:52.067
knowing all the depravity

51:52.067 --> 51:54.403
you've witnessed
in the last century

51:54.403 --> 51:58.615
will be nothing
compared to the suffering

51:58.615 --> 52:02.619
I'm going to unleash
on this world.

52:03.454 --> 52:06.457
The world you chose over mine.

52:08.250 --> 52:11.420
When I'm finished,
the entire human race,

52:11.420 --> 52:15.132
everyone you care about,
will suffer.

52:16.967 --> 52:19.470
Because you betrayed me.

52:43.035 --> 52:45.579
-Holy shit.
-Hands in the air.

52:52.378 --> 52:55.798
I destroyed everything.

52:56.799 --> 52:58.342
I'll call it in.

52:58.342 --> 53:01.178
I thought
I could save these people

53:01.178 --> 53:04.181
by bringing Dracula
all of their monsters,

53:04.181 --> 53:05.766
but what I've really done is

53:05.766 --> 53:08.811
deliver my monster
right to them.

53:11.271 --> 53:12.940
Did you call it in?

53:12.940 --> 53:14.733
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:38.173 --> 53:39.508
What the fuck?

53:43.011 --> 53:44.888
I'm sorry, Rebecca.

53:54.440 --> 53:56.191
It's okay.

53:56.191 --> 53:58.402
This is not about you,
Miss Quincy.

53:58.402 --> 54:00.821
It's about him.

54:00.821 --> 54:03.657
I need to find out
what happened to Teddy

54:03.657 --> 54:05.993
and punish those responsible.

54:05.993 --> 54:08.537
You, of all people,
should understand that.

54:09.371 --> 54:11.457
Well, I was gonna
take him to jail.

54:11.457 --> 54:12.916
You all should come, too.

54:12.916 --> 54:15.544
Look, Quincy,
this is a big arrest you made.

54:15.544 --> 54:17.629
I want to offer you
a full promotion.

54:17.629 --> 54:21.049
Right? Better hours, better pay,

54:21.049 --> 54:23.969
better parking space--
in fact, Kyle's parking space.

54:23.969 --> 54:26.430
-Uh, hey.
-Fuck you, Kyle!

54:26.430 --> 54:27.890
Congratulations.

54:27.890 --> 54:31.518
I know this is not exactly
what you were hoping for,

54:31.518 --> 54:37.274
but success really is
the best revenge.

54:54.833 --> 54:56.293
Okay.

55:05.928 --> 55:07.930
Fuck!

55:15.646 --> 55:18.649
I want the whole city activated.

55:18.649 --> 55:19.983
Find them.

55:19.983 --> 55:22.069
Attention, all officers.

55:22.069 --> 55:25.072
Officer Rebecca Quincy
is now a wanted fugitive.

55:25.072 --> 55:28.283
She and her male accomplice are
armed and extremely dangerous.

55:28.283 --> 55:29.660
Officer Rebecca Quincy

55:29.660 --> 55:31.036
and one unknown assailant.

55:31.036 --> 55:32.996
Proceed with deadly force.

55:40.462 --> 55:41.838
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

55:41.838 --> 55:43.590
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

55:43.590 --> 55:46.009
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

55:46.009 --> 55:48.679
Wait. No, no, no, no, no.

55:50.180 --> 55:53.392
This crime family of yours,

55:53.392 --> 55:56.019
would it enjoy witnessing

55:56.019 --> 55:59.606
the beheading of its enemies

55:59.606 --> 56:04.945
and the impalement
of all who oppose it?

56:05.821 --> 56:07.864
That's-that's...
that's, like, our...

56:07.864 --> 56:10.409
that's, like,
our whole thing, man.

56:10.409 --> 56:13.036
And can the family
raise me soldiers?

56:13.036 --> 56:15.956
We can... I can make
a couple calls, yeah.

56:15.956 --> 56:20.377
Whatever pain
Renfield caused you,

56:20.377 --> 56:23.797
I will return 10,000-fold.

56:24.756 --> 56:29.094
I will unleash an army of death

56:29.094 --> 56:32.264
whilst warming my skin

56:32.264 --> 56:37.144
next to mountains
of burning corpses.

56:41.189 --> 56:43.567
How does that sound to you?

56:48.530 --> 56:51.825
It sounds like
you got to meet my mom.

57:01.752 --> 57:04.087
Are you happy,
or are you gonna fuck me up?

57:16.933 --> 57:18.518
How are you feeling?

57:19.353 --> 57:20.687
Hope you're hungry.

57:22.064 --> 57:23.815
It's okay.

57:23.815 --> 57:26.943
It's okay, your gun and phone
are on the side right there.

57:28.028 --> 57:30.864
I'm just gonna... gonna
set these down right here.

57:30.864 --> 57:32.282
There we go.

57:32.282 --> 57:34.117
-Where am I?
-My place.

57:34.117 --> 57:35.786
It's not an abduction.

57:35.786 --> 57:39.039
In fact, uh, you know, I'm very
much still in your custody.

57:40.624 --> 57:41.917
Mind if I sit?

57:49.299 --> 57:51.510
Snickerdoodle?

57:52.803 --> 57:55.305
I don't want
your murder cookies.

57:55.305 --> 57:57.557
They're just regular cookies.

57:57.557 --> 57:59.142
Well, I don't know what
"regular cookies" means

57:59.142 --> 58:00.477
to a murderer.

58:00.477 --> 58:02.979
Um, I don't really
know that, either.

58:02.979 --> 58:04.398
Ooh. Careful.

58:04.398 --> 58:05.982
-You should just rest up.
-Oh. Okay.

58:05.982 --> 58:07.150
-You okay?
-Yes.

58:07.150 --> 58:08.902
Give me the...
give me the murder cookie.

58:08.902 --> 58:10.946
-Oh, yeah. -Just not the one
that looks like shit.

58:10.946 --> 58:13.156
I don't know which one
you think looks like shit.

58:13.156 --> 58:15.117
Thank you.

58:16.993 --> 58:19.204
Listen, I feel like I should
give you an explanation.

58:19.204 --> 58:20.997
No explanation necessary.

58:20.997 --> 58:25.001
I don't want you to think of me
as some kind of... murderer,

58:25.001 --> 58:29.131
when it's really
much more nuanced than that.

58:29.131 --> 58:31.049
You know, if you just
hear me out for a second,

58:31.049 --> 58:33.635
then you'll understand I'm...
I'm not such a bad guy.

58:33.635 --> 58:35.470
I don't give a shit
what kind of guy you are.

58:35.470 --> 58:37.180
Okay, there's no need
to be mean.

58:37.180 --> 58:38.557
Excuse me?

58:38.557 --> 58:40.142
I saved your life. Twice.

58:40.142 --> 58:41.935
I'm not saying we need
to be friends, but you're in

58:41.935 --> 58:44.062
a lot of shit right now,
and there's a very good chance

58:44.062 --> 58:45.939
I might be the only person
you can actually trust.

58:45.939 --> 58:49.943
The fact that you are
the only person that I can trust

58:49.943 --> 58:52.738
just proves that I am
monumentally fucked.

58:52.738 --> 58:54.406
Well, maybe you're fucked
because of

58:54.406 --> 58:56.283
-your unresolved anger.
-What?!

58:56.283 --> 58:58.827
I'm no psychologist, but I've
been to a couple of meetings...

58:58.827 --> 59:00.537
Oh, you've-you've been
to some meetings? Yeah?

59:00.537 --> 59:02.622
Where the people come in,
they're like, "Oh, hi.

59:02.622 --> 59:04.750
How you doing?"
Drink some coffee,

59:04.750 --> 59:06.418
then get brutally
fucking murdered?

59:06.418 --> 59:07.627
Those meetings?

59:07.627 --> 59:09.713
Uh, yes. Those meetings.

59:10.505 --> 59:12.215
You know what?

59:12.215 --> 59:13.675
I am angry.

59:13.675 --> 59:15.802
I graduated top of my class,

59:15.802 --> 59:18.430
and I'm still working
DUI checkpoints

59:18.430 --> 59:21.224
in a town with
daiquiri drive-throughs.

59:21.224 --> 59:24.561
I bust my ass
for a city that is corrupt

59:24.561 --> 59:26.563
and lets the people
that killed my father

59:26.563 --> 59:28.231
get away with anything
they want to do.

59:28.231 --> 59:31.234
But unlike you,
I can't go and take out my anger

59:31.234 --> 59:34.654
by killing every asshole on the
street who I think deserves it.

59:35.405 --> 59:38.074
I'm sorry. That sounds...

59:38.074 --> 59:39.868
painful and, um...

59:43.205 --> 59:46.208
I'm not taking out my anger,
if you'd let me explain.

59:46.208 --> 59:47.584
Please.

59:47.584 --> 59:49.127
Okay.

59:51.254 --> 59:52.756
By all means.

59:57.677 --> 59:59.596
I work for Dracula.

59:59.596 --> 1:00:01.306
What?

1:00:01.306 --> 1:00:02.891
Dracula.

1:00:03.892 --> 1:00:04.768
Dracula?

1:00:04.768 --> 1:00:07.521
-Dracula.
-Count Dracula?

1:00:07.521 --> 1:00:09.815
No, no. President Dracula.

1:00:09.815 --> 1:00:11.775
Yes, of co... Yes. Sorry.

1:00:11.775 --> 1:00:13.777
Count Dracula.
I'm... I'm his familiar.

1:00:13.777 --> 1:00:15.445
I-I... you know,
I tend to his needs,

1:00:15.445 --> 1:00:18.156
including care, feeding,
uh, you know,

1:00:18.156 --> 1:00:20.909
anything especially during
the daylight hours.

1:00:20.909 --> 1:00:23.870
Like, you get Dracula
people to eat?

1:00:23.870 --> 1:00:26.206
I do other stuff, too.

1:00:26.206 --> 1:00:28.375
Like what? Wash his cape?

1:00:28.375 --> 1:00:29.751
No.

1:00:29.751 --> 1:00:31.336
It's dry-clean only.

1:00:32.796 --> 1:00:34.798
My God.

1:00:34.798 --> 1:00:39.010
I cannot believe
I bought into your bullshit.

1:00:39.803 --> 1:00:41.471
You're not a hero.

1:00:41.471 --> 1:00:43.098
You're not even a villain.

1:00:43.098 --> 1:00:46.351
You're just a guy
that kills random people.

1:00:51.231 --> 1:00:52.816
What?

1:00:52.816 --> 1:00:54.734
Rebecca, you were right.

1:00:54.734 --> 1:00:56.778
I ran that pen through Interpol.

1:00:56.778 --> 1:00:58.697
This is beyond the Lobos.

1:00:58.697 --> 1:01:00.907
Whoever's responsible
for those disappearances

1:01:00.907 --> 1:01:02.826
has been linked to cases
all over the world

1:01:02.826 --> 1:01:04.953
going back decades.

1:01:04.953 --> 1:01:08.707
If this is the same guy,
he's probably 70 or 80 years old

1:01:08.707 --> 1:01:11.334
and he might be
the most prolific serial killer

1:01:11.334 --> 1:01:12.878
the world has ever known.

1:01:12.878 --> 1:01:14.296
So, where are you?

1:01:14.296 --> 1:01:17.132
Where am I? Um...

1:01:17.132 --> 1:01:18.842
I'm-I'm at his...
I'm at his place.

1:01:18.842 --> 1:01:20.510
But-but it's-it's okay
because he's-he's in...

1:01:20.510 --> 1:01:21.636
-he's in my custody.
-What?

1:01:21.636 --> 1:01:23.847
And he made me some cookies.

1:01:23.847 --> 1:01:25.348
You didn't eat the cookies,
did you?

1:01:25.348 --> 1:01:28.977
No. I don't eat the cookies
of strange men.

1:01:28.977 --> 1:01:30.812
Okay. Well, I'm gonna head
over there with my team.

1:01:30.812 --> 1:01:32.772
No, no, no. Don't.
I need to get him to you.

1:01:32.772 --> 1:01:34.065
The Lobos are after him, too.

1:01:34.065 --> 1:01:35.609
I don't know who we can trust.

1:01:35.609 --> 1:01:37.277
Meet me at Café Du Monde
in 20 minutes.

1:01:37.277 --> 1:01:40.864
Okay, just...
please be careful, Rebecca.

1:01:41.781 --> 1:01:43.700
You, too.

1:02:10.143 --> 1:02:11.895
Oh, shit.

1:02:11.895 --> 1:02:13.313
Go, go.

1:02:18.234 --> 1:02:20.236
All units,
you have a green light.

1:02:20.236 --> 1:02:21.321
Commence attack.

1:02:33.041 --> 1:02:34.960
We need to find a bug. Now.

1:02:37.420 --> 1:02:38.713
Why?

1:02:38.713 --> 1:02:40.131
Their life force gives me power.

1:02:40.131 --> 1:02:41.758
Their life force
gives you power?

1:02:41.758 --> 1:02:43.176
Yes. It's confusing,
but trust me, it works.

1:02:43.176 --> 1:02:45.053
Any second now,
a shit ton of guys

1:02:45.053 --> 1:02:47.347
are coming up those stairs,
and if you want me to do

1:02:47.347 --> 1:02:49.975
what I did at the restaurant,
we need to find a bug now.

1:02:49.975 --> 1:02:52.936
-You two, with me.
-Go, go, go.

1:02:53.853 --> 1:02:55.397
Come on.
A juicy spider, anything.

1:02:56.398 --> 1:02:58.441
Yes!

1:02:58.441 --> 1:03:00.402
Give me that!

1:03:06.658 --> 1:03:08.535
You're a bad man, Mr. Renfield!

1:03:09.744 --> 1:03:11.329
Yeah, well...

You know when

1:05:26.923 --> 1:05:28.299
and someone's like,

1:05:28.299 --> 1:05:29.968
"I'm so sorry
you had to see that"?

1:05:29.968 --> 1:05:31.761
-Mm.
-And the other person's like,

1:05:31.761 --> 1:05:33.763
"It's okay,
I've seen way worse"?

1:05:33.763 --> 1:05:35.431
Yeah.

1:05:36.724 --> 1:05:40.103
Everything I saw you do today
is gonna be my "way worse."

1:05:40.103 --> 1:05:42.605
This shit's gotten
completely out of control.

1:05:42.605 --> 1:05:44.149
And for what? Teddy?

1:05:44.149 --> 1:05:45.900
He's a freaking idiot.

1:05:45.900 --> 1:05:48.486
I'm sorry, Bella, but I'm out.

1:05:48.486 --> 1:05:49.946
Get the fuck out my way.

1:05:49.946 --> 1:05:52.157
This whole family
is fucking nuts.

1:05:52.157 --> 1:05:53.950
Oh, hey.
I was just talking about...

1:06:01.916 --> 1:06:04.210
Looks like he's back in.

1:06:04.210 --> 1:06:05.545
Son.

1:06:05.545 --> 1:06:07.755
Oh, Mom.

1:06:07.755 --> 1:06:09.257
Where have you been?

1:06:09.257 --> 1:06:11.467
Oh, I've been getting my hands
real fucking dirty.

1:06:11.467 --> 1:06:13.595
Come here.
I got to show you someone.

1:06:22.020 --> 1:06:24.731
Right there.
Put it down right there.

1:06:24.731 --> 1:06:27.025
Right in front of the head.

1:06:42.540 --> 1:06:45.001
It's fucking Dracula!

1:06:45.001 --> 1:06:47.754
It's the real fucking Dracula!

1:06:47.754 --> 1:06:49.547
Fuck, man!

1:06:49.547 --> 1:06:51.925
He wants to take over
the world with us.

1:06:51.925 --> 1:06:55.011
Hello, Mr. Dracula.

1:06:55.011 --> 1:06:58.514
Or should I say Prince Dracula?

1:06:58.514 --> 1:07:00.058
Enchantée.

1:07:00.058 --> 1:07:02.727
The pleasure is all mine.

1:07:04.687 --> 1:07:06.856
We have much to discuss.

1:07:06.856 --> 1:07:08.691
Oh.

1:07:08.691 --> 1:07:10.235
Okay.

1:07:11.152 --> 1:07:13.029
God, I hope
my sister gets here soon.

1:07:13.029 --> 1:07:14.781
There's a lot of heat on us.

1:07:14.781 --> 1:07:17.367
I took my family
to a place like this in London

1:07:17.367 --> 1:07:19.702
the morning I left
for Dracula's castle.

1:07:19.702 --> 1:07:21.371
You had a family?

1:07:21.371 --> 1:07:22.872
I did.

1:07:22.872 --> 1:07:26.209
Um, it was a... a long time ago.

1:07:27.627 --> 1:07:29.379
A really long time ago.

1:07:29.379 --> 1:07:31.381
Yeah, I'm older than I look.

1:07:31.381 --> 1:07:33.216
That's Lilian.
She was five then.

1:07:33.216 --> 1:07:35.009
I thought going to Europe

1:07:35.009 --> 1:07:36.511
to make some big deal
with a count

1:07:36.511 --> 1:07:39.222
would give us
the life we deserved.

1:07:40.723 --> 1:07:43.101
Or, um...

1:07:43.101 --> 1:07:45.061
what I thought I deserved.

1:07:47.021 --> 1:07:50.525
I let them down in so many ways.

1:07:56.197 --> 1:07:59.575
You know,
that's his greatest power.

1:07:59.575 --> 1:08:02.412
He looks into your eyes
and finds

1:08:02.412 --> 1:08:06.291
what you think you need
to make your life whole.

1:08:06.291 --> 1:08:09.252
Your... your dreams
and your desires

1:08:09.252 --> 1:08:13.756
and your... greed.

1:08:14.882 --> 1:08:16.426
Your shame.

1:08:16.426 --> 1:08:21.889
I blamed him for forcing me
to abandon my family,

1:08:21.889 --> 1:08:24.434
but that... that's not true.

1:08:24.434 --> 1:08:26.602
I...

1:08:26.602 --> 1:08:30.648
I wanted all those things,
and I chose to follow him.

1:08:30.648 --> 1:08:31.941
I'm not a victim. I'm...

1:08:31.941 --> 1:08:34.777
I made all those mistakes
on my own.

1:08:36.571 --> 1:08:39.324
Look, I don't think
you're such a bad guy.

1:08:40.408 --> 1:08:42.410
Life throws
a lot of shit at you,

1:08:42.410 --> 1:08:44.454
but sometimes
you fall under the thrall

1:08:44.454 --> 1:08:46.456
of a vampire for a few decades,

1:08:46.456 --> 1:08:50.335
and sometimes you call
your sister an unbearable twat

1:08:50.335 --> 1:08:53.004
at Grandma's birthday party.

1:08:54.839 --> 1:08:57.967
You should make things right
with your sister while you can.

1:08:57.967 --> 1:08:59.302
Hmm?

1:09:00.803 --> 1:09:02.805
Speaking of.

1:09:05.183 --> 1:09:07.310
I'm gonna call her.

1:09:10.563 --> 1:09:12.523
Renfield. It's so wonderful

1:09:12.523 --> 1:09:14.484
that you have finally
found someone

1:09:14.484 --> 1:09:19.072
who does inspire you
to grow as a person.

1:09:19.072 --> 1:09:20.531
Hey, where are you?

1:09:20.531 --> 1:09:22.200
I have found some people

1:09:22.200 --> 1:09:24.327
who will unleash my potential
as well.

1:09:24.327 --> 1:09:26.454
They understand this world

1:09:26.454 --> 1:09:29.749
for what it is
and what it needs.

1:09:29.749 --> 1:09:33.211
Hello, Rebecca.

1:09:33.211 --> 1:09:34.837
Looking for someone?

1:09:34.837 --> 1:09:36.297
Where's my sister?

1:09:36.297 --> 1:09:39.342
I offered you so much, Rebecca,

1:09:39.342 --> 1:09:43.346
but you put your faith
in such fragile institutions

1:09:43.346 --> 1:09:47.016
instead of something
far more enduring.

1:09:47.016 --> 1:09:48.851
We've got your sister.

1:09:48.851 --> 1:09:51.187
She doesn't have much time.

1:09:52.063 --> 1:09:54.399
Rebecca, where are you going?

1:09:54.399 --> 1:09:56.526
-To get my sister.
-Rebecca, you don't understand.

1:09:56.526 --> 1:09:58.778
It's not just the Lobos. It's...

1:09:58.778 --> 1:10:00.363
Dracula is with them.

1:10:00.363 --> 1:10:02.865
-Fine. I'll go myself.
-Look, please.

1:10:02.865 --> 1:10:04.450
I tried to stand up to him,

1:10:04.450 --> 1:10:08.538
and he killed people
I cared about.

1:10:08.538 --> 1:10:10.873
I can't let that happen again.

1:10:10.873 --> 1:10:13.251
You want to be a hero, Renfield?

1:10:13.251 --> 1:10:15.211
You have to risk everything.

1:10:15.211 --> 1:10:17.880
And as someone
that cares about you,

1:10:17.880 --> 1:10:20.842
you're never really gonna
be free until you face him.

1:10:20.842 --> 1:10:22.468
You care about me?

1:10:22.468 --> 1:10:24.262
Is that what it takes
to get you in the car?

1:10:24.262 --> 1:10:26.055
All right,
if we're gonna do this,

1:10:26.055 --> 1:10:29.058
we need to prepare, and
we need to do it before sunset.

1:10:29.058 --> 1:10:30.685
I'm ready to do it before lunch.

1:10:30.685 --> 1:10:32.395
Okay.

1:10:32.395 --> 1:10:34.564
Let's face it,
they know we're coming,

1:10:34.564 --> 1:10:36.566
so let's go in style.

1:10:38.317 --> 1:10:40.528
Yeah, just guns won't be enough.

1:10:42.280 --> 1:10:46.075
I'm gonna need bugs--
lots of bugs--

1:10:46.075 --> 1:10:47.743
wooden stakes,

1:10:47.743 --> 1:10:49.745
uh, crucifixes,

1:10:49.745 --> 1:10:52.331
and, uh,
maybe a protection circle.

1:10:52.331 --> 1:10:53.666
What the fuck is
a protection circle?

1:10:53.666 --> 1:10:55.501
It's a circle
made of powder that--

1:10:55.501 --> 1:10:57.753
it-it traps demons
if you say the right,

1:10:57.753 --> 1:11:00.173
-uh, Latin stuff.
-Forget it.

Can you maybe
save that for later?

1:11:13.769 --> 1:11:15.438
Oh, sorry.

1:11:15.438 --> 1:11:17.815
-It's all in...
-Is it in my teeth?

1:11:17.815 --> 1:11:19.692

1:11:35.541 --> 1:11:37.668
Make sure you save your sister.

1:11:48.137 --> 1:11:50.640
Must be nice...

1:11:50.640 --> 1:11:53.851
not needing to be invited in.

1:11:53.851 --> 1:11:56.437
Wait a second. Wait a second.
Don't I know you?

1:11:56.437 --> 1:11:58.898
Because you look so...

1:12:04.695 --> 1:12:06.572
...familiar.

1:12:56.038 --> 1:12:57.665
Afternoon, Officer.

1:12:58.457 --> 1:13:00.042
Shit. I'm out.

1:13:01.544 --> 1:13:04.088
You think I need guns
to fuck you up?

1:13:04.088 --> 1:13:06.048
Let's do this. What the fuck?

1:13:20.396 --> 1:13:22.106
Fuck!

1:13:26.611 --> 1:13:29.113
You should've taken my offer
when you had the chance.

1:13:30.406 --> 1:13:31.907
Now the only choice
you're gonna get

1:13:31.907 --> 1:13:34.744
is which one of your limbs
I'm gonna tear off first!

1:13:35.328 --> 1:13:36.912
Go!

1:13:38.080 --> 1:13:39.665
No!

1:13:46.213 --> 1:13:49.842
Oh, this must drive you crazy--
him choosing me over you.

1:13:49.842 --> 1:13:51.886
I don't really have
strong feelings about it.

1:13:51.886 --> 1:13:54.221
I'm clearly the yin
to your yang.

1:13:54.221 --> 1:13:55.640
We've barely met twice.

1:13:55.640 --> 1:13:57.433
You patronizing piece of shit!

1:14:00.394 --> 1:14:03.147
Oh, my goodness.

1:14:03.147 --> 1:14:05.149
You almost scared me.

1:14:05.149 --> 1:14:06.359
Where's my sister?

1:14:06.359 --> 1:14:07.693
Oh, that.

1:14:07.693 --> 1:14:09.278
One moment, please.

1:14:09.278 --> 1:14:11.656
I need to set the mood first.

1:14:26.295 --> 1:14:28.047
-Hello, Rebecca.

1:14:30.132 --> 1:14:31.300
Don't worry.

1:14:31.300 --> 1:14:33.219
I won't hurt you.

1:14:33.219 --> 1:14:35.638
It's nice to finally meet you.

1:14:37.306 --> 1:14:42.061
I can only imagine what
you might have heard about me

1:14:42.061 --> 1:14:44.188
from poor Renfield.

1:14:44.188 --> 1:14:47.983
Besides making him bring you
people to eat?

1:14:47.983 --> 1:14:53.989
Well, we did have
a complicated relationship.

1:14:55.157 --> 1:14:58.577
However, when I saw you
through his eyes,

1:14:58.577 --> 1:15:01.997
I knew I had
to make things right.

1:15:01.997 --> 1:15:04.500
Having Dracula powers
is fucking amazing.

1:15:04.500 --> 1:15:07.086
Stop saying "Dracula powers."

1:15:08.129 --> 1:15:10.172
Fine. What do you call it?

1:15:10.172 --> 1:15:11.674
It's a curse.

1:15:12.675 --> 1:15:15.886
God, you're such
a fucking drama queen.

1:15:17.096 --> 1:15:19.432
Would you please listen?

1:15:19.432 --> 1:15:21.183
They come with a cost, okay?

1:15:21.183 --> 1:15:22.727
You'll become his slave.

1:15:22.727 --> 1:15:26.021
See, that's where you're wrong,
because Master told me...

1:15:27.231 --> 1:15:28.399
Shit.

1:15:28.399 --> 1:15:29.942
Mm-hmm.

1:15:31.736 --> 1:15:36.073
For half a millennium,
I've seen only weakness

1:15:36.073 --> 1:15:38.534
in the hearts of men.

1:15:40.536 --> 1:15:45.207
And then I looked into yours.

1:15:49.628 --> 1:15:54.967
Renfield used only
the smallest taste of my power

1:15:54.967 --> 1:15:57.219
to do what he thought was good.

1:15:57.219 --> 1:16:01.974
Imagine what I could do,
Rebecca, with you by my side.

1:16:01.974 --> 1:16:04.685
We could bring
the justice you seek

1:16:04.685 --> 1:16:07.271
to those who've escaped it
for too long.

1:16:16.697 --> 1:16:20.242
-And I can heal your sister.

1:16:23.996 --> 1:16:27.708
My blood will bring her back.

1:16:28.584 --> 1:16:29.919
No.

1:16:29.919 --> 1:16:32.004
Say the word, Rebecca,

1:16:32.004 --> 1:16:35.800
and I will undo
what the Lobos have done.

1:16:35.800 --> 1:16:38.385
All I ask in exchange...

1:16:41.597 --> 1:16:44.975
...is for you

1:16:44.975 --> 1:16:47.186
to join me.

1:16:47.186 --> 1:16:48.521
No, don't listen to him.

1:16:48.521 --> 1:16:51.148
He said the same shit to me.

1:17:00.074 --> 1:17:01.617
Can you save her?

1:17:02.409 --> 1:17:04.036
Yes.

1:17:09.792 --> 1:17:11.460
What did he call you again?

1:17:11.460 --> 1:17:12.711
An empty fucking husk?

1:17:12.711 --> 1:17:14.630
See, that... that is why

1:17:14.630 --> 1:17:16.590
Dracula and I work
so well together.

1:17:16.590 --> 1:17:18.300
I'm a full husk,

1:17:18.300 --> 1:17:20.219
full of everything you're not.

1:17:20.219 --> 1:17:23.639
Strength, power, loyalty!

1:17:37.653 --> 1:17:39.530
Her time is running out.

1:17:39.530 --> 1:17:40.656
Oh, join me.

1:17:40.656 --> 1:17:42.032
Don't.

1:17:44.577 --> 1:17:47.413
I told you,
this is what he does.

1:17:47.413 --> 1:17:48.873
So what?

1:17:49.665 --> 1:17:51.584
I lost my dad.

1:17:51.584 --> 1:17:53.252
I can't lose my sister.

1:17:57.256 --> 1:17:59.884
And if he can give her
back to me...

1:18:01.677 --> 1:18:03.888
...I don't care
if I lose myself.

1:18:05.014 --> 1:18:06.849
You were wrong about him.

1:18:06.849 --> 1:18:08.809
He's not a monster.

1:18:08.809 --> 1:18:11.854
He wants to be better, like you.

1:18:12.688 --> 1:18:14.356
Maybe I can help.

1:18:15.399 --> 1:18:18.944
In all the darkness,
I can find the light.

1:18:35.127 --> 1:18:36.295
Shit.

1:19:40.609 --> 1:19:41.986
That was impressive.

1:19:43.612 --> 1:19:47.700
I can see what Renfield saw...

1:19:47.700 --> 1:19:49.618
in you.

1:19:53.956 --> 1:19:57.167
Now he'll see it go into me.

1:20:09.847 --> 1:20:11.890
Congratulations.

1:20:11.890 --> 1:20:13.726
You shot my foot.

1:20:13.726 --> 1:20:17.521
Your foot still bleeds.

1:20:25.738 --> 1:20:27.322
Die!

1:20:34.038 --> 1:20:36.498
No! Oh, no!

1:20:43.172 --> 1:20:47.593
You can't take my teeth.

1:20:50.012 --> 1:20:53.223
You see, there will always
be people like you.

1:20:53.223 --> 1:20:56.518
There are far more Renfields
in this world

1:20:56.518 --> 1:20:58.187
than there are Rebeccas.

1:20:58.187 --> 1:20:59.772
He's right.

1:20:59.772 --> 1:21:01.857
There are millions
of people like me.

1:21:01.857 --> 1:21:02.900
I am enough...

1:21:02.900 --> 1:21:04.693
And they're all

1:21:04.693 --> 1:21:06.195
trying to figure out

1:21:06.195 --> 1:21:08.447
how to overcome
their destructive relationships.

1:21:08.447 --> 1:21:12.201
Always remember, you're the one
with the real power.

1:21:12.201 --> 1:21:14.161
Millions of codependent people.

1:21:14.161 --> 1:21:18.290
I am the dark poetry
in the hearts of all mankind.

1:21:18.290 --> 1:21:20.709
-Millions of people

1:21:20.709 --> 1:21:23.712
just like me.

1:21:23.712 --> 1:21:26.090
All you got to do
is take it back.

1:21:26.090 --> 1:21:28.801
Do you know what you are?

1:21:28.801 --> 1:21:32.221
Yes, I do.

1:21:35.307 --> 1:21:37.893
-I'm Robert...

1:21:37.893 --> 1:21:40.979
Montague Renfield,

1:21:40.979 --> 1:21:43.440
and I'm a codependent.

1:21:48.612 --> 1:21:50.906
You're right. You didn't
have to use your power

1:21:50.906 --> 1:21:52.825
to make me your servant,

1:21:52.825 --> 1:21:55.619
because I gave
all my power to you.

1:21:55.619 --> 1:21:57.830
And I can take it back.

1:21:57.830 --> 1:22:00.749
I am enough!

1:22:00.749 --> 1:22:03.877
And I have enough!

1:22:03.877 --> 1:22:07.464
And I am capable of change!

1:22:08.632 --> 1:22:10.217
Because I love myself.

1:22:10.217 --> 1:22:12.010
-I'm taking...

1:22:12.010 --> 1:22:17.099
full charge of my life today!

1:22:17.099 --> 1:22:19.810
Look into my eyes, Dracula.

1:22:21.270 --> 1:22:24.439
Full power, motherfucker.

1:22:41.206 --> 1:22:43.208
Holy shit, it worked.

1:22:44.459 --> 1:22:46.336
Is that a protection circle?

1:22:46.336 --> 1:22:48.797
I got the instructions
off a Wiccan Tumblr.

1:22:48.797 --> 1:22:51.216
Oh. And-and that?

1:22:51.216 --> 1:22:53.218
-Cocaine.
-Really?

1:22:53.218 --> 1:22:55.470
Yeah.
I guess any kind of powder works

1:22:55.470 --> 1:22:58.891
as long as you say
the right magic words.

1:22:58.891 --> 1:23:01.143
Wow.
Thank you, Wiccan Tumblr.

1:23:07.649 --> 1:23:11.153

there is so much

how to actually kill a vampire,

1:24:03.705 --> 1:24:05.249
it gets confusing.

from some crazy shit,
so why not try everything?

You know, I'm not even
100% sure this will kill him,

1:24:12.422 --> 1:24:17.010
but I do know it will take him
a long, long time

Hey. You okay?

Renfield said
you guys gave me some...

1:24:39.157 --> 1:24:40.993
Dracula blood?

1:24:40.993 --> 1:24:43.662
Oh, no, no.
It's a euphemism for, uh...

1:24:43.662 --> 1:24:45.747
it's an... it's an...
like, an herbal remedy.

1:24:45.747 --> 1:24:49.042
Okay. So, do you think
they carry it at GNC?

1:24:49.042 --> 1:24:52.546
Yeah. Yeah, I th-think so.

1:24:57.801 --> 1:24:59.469
I love you, Kate.

1:25:03.932 --> 1:25:05.559
So...

1:25:07.936 --> 1:25:10.022
There's only one thing
left to do.

1:25:10.022 --> 1:25:12.274
You know...

1:25:12.274 --> 1:25:14.401
I've got to pay
for what I've done.

1:25:14.401 --> 1:25:17.446
I don't want you to go somewhere
just to punish yourself.

1:25:18.238 --> 1:25:19.781
You belong out in the world.

1:25:19.781 --> 1:25:23.160
People have a lot to learn
from a person like you.

1:25:23.160 --> 1:25:25.162
Like what?

1:25:25.162 --> 1:25:28.373
It's never too late
to be a hero.

1:25:28.373 --> 1:25:29.750
Hmm.

1:25:29.750 --> 1:25:32.461
I was lost
in a world of darkness

1:25:32.461 --> 1:25:33.795
for a very long time,

1:25:33.795 --> 1:25:36.798
but with all of your help,

1:25:36.798 --> 1:25:38.925
I, um...

1:25:38.925 --> 1:25:40.469
I found a way out.

1:25:40.469 --> 1:25:44.598
Without you, I would never
have learned that...

1:25:45.974 --> 1:25:48.143
...I could save myself.

1:25:48.143 --> 1:25:52.356
And thank you
for using Dracula blood

1:25:52.356 --> 1:25:54.566
to bring us all back to life.

1:25:54.566 --> 1:25:56.526
-You know, if it...

1:25:56.526 --> 1:25:58.528
if it wasn't for you,
uh, none of us

1:25:58.528 --> 1:26:00.364
would have learned
what it's like

1:26:00.364 --> 1:26:02.908
to come back
from the other side,

1:26:02.908 --> 1:26:04.993
having seen things

1:26:04.993 --> 1:26:07.245
that you can't unsee.

1:26:07.245 --> 1:26:10.082
And know things

1:26:10.082 --> 1:26:13.210
that you can't unknow.

1:26:14.002 --> 1:26:16.129
Okay.

1:26:16.129 --> 1:26:18.507
Fantastic meeting today, guys.

1:26:18.507 --> 1:26:20.842
-Truly.

1:26:23.887 --> 1:26:25.472
I hope he's okay.

1:26:25.472 --> 1:26:27.265
-He'll be all right.
-Hmm.

1:26:27.265 --> 1:26:30.435
My name is
Robert Montague Renfield,

1:26:30.435 --> 1:26:32.187
and I'm a codependent.

1:26:32.187 --> 1:26:34.356
But I no longer feel
like a victim,

1:26:34.356 --> 1:26:36.817
because I've finally
faced my demons.

1:26:36.817 --> 1:26:38.860
You might also say
I chopped my demons up

1:26:38.860 --> 1:26:41.571
into tiny little pieces,
encased them in concrete

1:26:41.571 --> 1:26:43.448
and flushed them down the drain.

1:26:43.448 --> 1:26:45.867
And if I can find the power
to do that,

1:26:45.867 --> 1:26:48.328
then maybe everyone can.
