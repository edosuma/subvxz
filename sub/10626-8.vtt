WEBVTT

00:00.040 --> 00:01.728
There was a moment
when I thought

00:01.746 --> 00:02.859
we could be perfect

00:03.473 --> 00:06.701
and then I saw you kill a man
without hesitation.

00:07.340 --> 00:08.301
It's over!

00:08.740 --> 00:09.853
I'm being set up.

00:10.044 --> 00:11.261
Where was Orwell?

00:11.279 --> 00:13.768
And you answer my
bloody question!

00:13.980 --> 00:15.905
You're chasing the wrong man.

00:16.043 --> 00:17.587
You just let her walk away.

00:18.554 --> 00:19.773
She is out there.

00:22.953 --> 00:24.377
You loved me so much

00:24.395 --> 00:27.405
you gave me
the most incredible gift.

00:27.986 --> 00:29.848
You kissed me on the
cheek and then you...

00:30.035 --> 00:31.403
sealed it around my wrist.

00:31.779 --> 00:34.164
And now I have nothing.

00:34.316 --> 00:36.280
We need you here. I need you.

00:36.368 --> 00:37.638
Stay! Please!

00:37.739 --> 00:38.508
Okay.

00:40.128 --> 00:41.215
Here's you

00:41.580 --> 00:43.927
on your wrist is that bracelet!

00:43.948 --> 00:47.491
Now you can tell yourself that
this is a magician's trick.

00:47.914 --> 00:49.322
You know I keep waiting,

00:49.405 --> 00:51.400
expecting I'm gonna turn
round and there she is.

You're lucky tonight.

01:10.021 --> 01:11.403
I'm always lucky!

01:12.400 --> 01:14.194
You said you weren't coming back.

01:14.926 --> 01:17.324
Thought you'd gone and found God,

01:19.023 --> 01:21.348
like the rest of the losers.

01:22.016 --> 01:23.250
Well.

01:23.804 --> 01:25.226
I'm back.

01:26.808 --> 01:28.047
Lets see you play.

01:28.575 --> 01:30.718
I could beat you
with three cards.

01:31.089 --> 01:32.258
No changes.

01:32.719 --> 01:33.727
Blind.

01:35.200 --> 01:36.829
Ten grand says not.

01:37.010 --> 01:38.109
Twenty.

01:39.876 --> 01:40.936
Come on.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.055
Who'll have twenty
grand on that?

01:44.009 --> 01:45.170
Live a little.

01:46.966 --> 01:48.463
Yeah, okay, I'm in.

02:12.721 --> 02:15.701
That's it... Thought that
was a, a dead cert.

02:17.049 --> 02:18.672
What am I gonna do now?

02:19.872 --> 02:21.148
Shit!

02:29.343 --> 02:30.590
You're late Harvey.

02:30.608 --> 02:32.059
Take it easy. Calm down.

02:32.078 --> 02:35.206
You're not the one standing
with four hundred K on them.

02:35.457 --> 02:37.496
No, I am the one bringing
the smack into the country.

02:37.616 --> 02:40.053
So if I can keep my shit
together, so can you.

02:40.072 --> 02:41.040
Mr. Harvey.

02:42.637 --> 02:43.698
Who are you?

02:44.136 --> 02:46.641
You don't know me, but I know you.

02:48.225 --> 02:50.909
The police suspect you
of killing four people,

02:50.928 --> 02:54.190
but the heroin you distributed has
taken the lives of many more.

02:54.359 --> 02:56.118
Therefore your life is forfeit.

02:58.336 --> 02:59.119
Damn.

02:59.267 --> 03:00.933
You, I don't know...

03:01.063 --> 03:03.318
But I'm gonna
guess that you deserve a bullet too.

03:09.224 --> 03:11.724
Go on, give us your best shot.

The Fallen Angel

04:34.656 --> 04:35.688
Morning.

04:35.858 --> 04:36.799
Hey.

04:37.168 --> 04:38.547
You're up early.

04:38.681 --> 04:39.859
I always am.

04:42.216 --> 04:43.561
Found the coffee.

04:46.335 --> 04:48.129
I had a great time last night.

04:49.408 --> 04:51.959
Do you err... Do you
fancy getting some breakfast?

04:52.033 --> 04:53.348
I'll be five minutes.

05:17.656 --> 05:20.329
Drug deal went sour?
So they shot each other?

05:20.767 --> 05:22.719
Can't imagine there was
anyone else here with them.

05:22.968 --> 05:24.461
We don't know that.

05:24.595 --> 05:26.471
Maybe a rival gang took 'em out.

05:26.720 --> 05:29.760
You think, the drugs and
money are still there.

05:33.304 --> 05:34.784
Right, yeah of course.

05:37.792 --> 05:39.119
Come on, Sherlock.

05:44.407 --> 05:47.279
I'm now retrieving a snub nosed

05:47.298 --> 05:50.423
nine millimetre bullet
from the cranium

05:51.020 --> 05:53.717
of our as yet
unidentified John Doe.

05:54.008 --> 05:56.230
Which would be consistent
with the short recoil

05:56.249 --> 05:58.663
semi-automatic pistol
found at the scene.

05:59.143 --> 06:01.579
I previously extracted a forty five

06:01.598 --> 06:03.689
from the neck of Andrew Harvey,

06:03.784 --> 06:06.225
which belonged to
the single action revolver.

06:07.139 --> 06:08.956
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

06:09.337 --> 06:10.973
That we caught a break?

06:12.294 --> 06:15.103
One of the biggest heroin dealers in London

06:15.605 --> 06:17.943
and we're nowhere close
to shutting him down.

06:17.962 --> 06:20.172
Then somebody else
does the job for us.

06:22.297 --> 06:25.966
Ralph, so you think
Andrew Harvey was killed

06:25.985 --> 06:27.347
with the single-action revolver?

06:27.488 --> 06:28.644
Almost certainly.

06:29.204 --> 06:30.429
Can I err...

06:35.296 --> 06:36.904
Whose prints are on the revolver?

06:36.970 --> 06:38.526
Ah, that's just in.

06:40.010 --> 06:41.354
Andrew Harvey.

06:41.912 --> 06:42.895
Oh?

06:42.985 --> 06:45.864
So the semi-automatic
belonged to John Doe?

06:48.351 --> 06:50.024
They didn't shoot each other.

06:50.523 --> 06:52.168
They shot themselves.

06:52.446 --> 06:53.832
What are the chances?

07:00.576 --> 07:01.940
I got your calling card.

07:02.026 --> 07:03.936
<i>You're such a narcissist.</i>

07:04.002 --> 07:05.840
Do you think everything is about you?

07:06.073 --> 07:07.994
We need to talk. Face to face.

07:09.113 --> 07:10.566
I'm not hiding.

07:11.189 --> 07:13.375
Use your bracelet, walk into any
bar at random,

07:13.394 --> 07:14.629
and I'm sure you'll be lucky.

07:14.710 --> 07:16.669
Just tell me where you are.

07:30.864 --> 07:32.336
You're not above the law.

07:32.553 --> 07:33.591
Of course I am.

07:34.336 --> 07:36.962
And you should be grateful
that I'm finishing the work

07:36.981 --> 07:38.650
your little team are failing to.

07:38.968 --> 07:41.037
That's why you're sleeping
with Winter?

07:41.056 --> 07:42.989
To gain access to our case files?

07:43.008 --> 07:44.757
You care who I have sex with now.

07:44.776 --> 07:46.518
Leave our cases alone.

07:46.537 --> 07:49.097
It's what the bracelets are for,
Harry.

07:50.709 --> 07:52.056
You're a psychopath.

07:57.128 --> 07:59.642
- Those files are confidential.
- Michelle Stephens.

07:59.746 --> 08:02.174
Died from an overdose at sixteen.

08:02.193 --> 08:04.697
And you have failed to catch
the dealer.

08:04.825 --> 08:06.487
We are preparing a case!

08:06.705 --> 08:08.076
Matthew Hamilton.

08:11.351 --> 08:13.653
You just can't prove
anything, can you?

08:13.672 --> 08:14.959
Look at him.

08:15.208 --> 08:17.768
Laughing. Showing off.

08:20.649 --> 08:22.312
- Don't.
- Hmm!

08:22.504 --> 08:24.466
Do you know how many people
are unlucky enough

08:24.485 --> 08:26.331
to die from choking each year?

08:26.433 --> 08:27.935
The statistics are shocking.

08:27.954 --> 08:29.128
I'm warning you.

08:29.448 --> 08:30.480
What?

08:31.015 --> 08:32.607
Are you going to arrest me?

08:33.419 --> 08:34.633
On what charge?

08:34.745 --> 08:37.501
You can punish all the guilty people
in the world,

08:37.870 --> 08:40.409
it won't bring your daughters back.

08:48.943 --> 08:50.214
Oh my God.

08:51.307 --> 08:52.696
Someone help.

09:00.608 --> 09:01.655
Come on!

09:07.640 --> 09:09.008
Thanks, mate!

09:10.600 --> 09:12.236
I thought I was a gonna!

09:12.255 --> 09:13.477
Go home.

09:13.705 --> 09:15.127
We haven't eaten yet.

09:15.700 --> 09:17.318
Go home. Now.

09:21.288 --> 09:22.768
- Come on, Carole.
- Carolina.

09:22.787 --> 09:23.931
Whatever.

09:37.654 --> 09:39.982
People I owe to now,
they're serious people,

09:40.638 --> 09:42.156
people you don't want to mess with.

09:44.970 --> 09:47.125
I, I don't know how
the debt got so bad.

09:48.046 --> 09:50.009
Seventy-seven and a half grand?

09:51.091 --> 09:52.927
Where am I gonna find that?

09:54.922 --> 09:57.909
So I tell, I tell myself the only way
I'm gonna make that money back

09:57.928 --> 10:01.315
is to gamble, which is insane,
I know, but then,

10:01.334 --> 10:03.411
then this perfect bet comes up.

10:03.430 --> 10:05.032
Like, dream odds

10:05.487 --> 10:07.196
and I lose more.

10:10.199 --> 10:11.454
You!

10:12.874 --> 10:14.169
You did this to me!

10:16.686 --> 10:18.644
Wait! Bill. Bill.

10:19.287 --> 10:20.469
Stay away from me.

10:20.694 --> 10:21.677
I can help you.

10:21.695 --> 10:23.790
You gonna give me my
twenty grand back?

10:23.889 --> 10:25.715
That's not the answer.

10:26.926 --> 10:28.355
It wouldn't matter if you did.

10:28.374 --> 10:30.549
I owe money, like really big money.

10:30.598 --> 10:31.676
I can help you.

10:32.644 --> 10:34.753
Have you got seventy-seven
and a half grand?

10:38.166 --> 10:39.348
What am I gonna do?

10:39.454 --> 10:40.728
You're not alone.

10:41.013 --> 10:42.912
You know call me, call any
one of these guys.

10:42.931 --> 10:44.721
We're your first line of defence.

10:45.094 --> 10:46.699
What if you're in too deep?

10:48.521 --> 10:49.663
Give me your mobile number.

10:50.047 --> 10:52.540
Come on, I'm gonna give you mine.
Bill trust me, give it to me!

11:11.334 --> 11:14.436
Hello... I'm sorry did we
have an arrangement?

11:14.670 --> 11:16.076
Am I looking after Daisy?

11:16.109 --> 11:17.281
No.

11:18.646 --> 11:19.676
Where's Rich?

11:20.032 --> 11:21.930
I asked him to give us some space.

11:25.070 --> 11:26.448
Is this an intervention?

11:26.718 --> 11:28.605
I don't want to stop you gambling.

11:37.159 --> 11:38.367
Pick one.

12:13.351 --> 12:15.496
Sorry no win. What did you get?

12:21.014 --> 12:22.654
Twenty thousand pounds.

12:29.815 --> 12:31.429
- Again. Do it.
- No.

12:46.775 --> 12:48.260
Thirty thousand.

12:52.734 --> 12:54.176
So it's true?

12:55.878 --> 12:58.572
Everything you told me
about that bracelet is true.

13:02.510 --> 13:04.832
How does it work?
It's impossible.

13:06.006 --> 13:07.683
It's two thousand years old.

13:09.004 --> 13:11.732
If there was an instruction
manual it's long gone.

13:14.799 --> 13:16.789
It's not a charm Anna.

13:18.172 --> 13:19.409
It's a curse!

13:19.670 --> 13:20.515
Why?

13:20.534 --> 13:22.836
Because for every bit of good
luck that happens to me.

13:22.854 --> 13:24.375
Someone close to me gets hurt.

13:27.279 --> 13:28.816
And it really can't come off?

13:30.943 --> 13:32.360
Only when I die.

13:54.192 --> 13:55.691
I'm sorry I doubted you.

14:01.188 --> 14:03.047
So what happens now?

14:32.399 --> 14:33.539
Morning Harry.

14:34.142 --> 14:36.406
I hope you've had
your breakfast.

14:39.471 --> 14:40.559
Jesus.

14:40.758 --> 14:43.826
Don't feel too sorry for him,
have a look at this.

14:51.414 --> 14:53.802
Who was he? Was he on our radar?

14:54.327 --> 14:57.339
Ralph's sighing a lot. Rarely
indicates an early ID.

14:58.453 --> 15:00.394
Did you hear about
Matthew Hamilton?

15:00.803 --> 15:01.990
Slipped on an olive.

15:02.961 --> 15:04.532
Could we be any luckier?

15:05.671 --> 15:08.817
This carries on we're gonna win,
Clean Up Rate of the Year award

15:08.836 --> 15:10.139
without lifting a finger.

15:15.278 --> 15:16.550
You burnt a man?

15:16.804 --> 15:18.489
<i>What kind of sick
bastard are you?</i>

15:18.694 --> 15:20.820
Well, I have no idea
what you're talking about,

15:20.839 --> 15:22.552
but you have my full attention.

15:22.615 --> 15:25.197
You're seriously trying to tell me
you weren't responsible for this?

15:25.216 --> 15:27.073
That's exactly what I just told you.

15:27.606 --> 15:29.020
Excellent Harry.

15:29.430 --> 15:31.162
So is this a competition?

15:31.855 --> 15:34.864
Shall we see who can bring
this killer to justice first?

15:35.709 --> 15:36.661
Isabella?

15:37.691 --> 15:38.938
Shit!

15:40.694 --> 15:42.680
Right Ralph. What do we know?

15:43.703 --> 15:45.638
Err, John Doe, male,

15:46.053 --> 15:48.915
his nose piercing survived
the petrol tank going up,

15:48.934 --> 15:50.620
but that's about all that did.

15:50.808 --> 15:51.866
ID?

15:53.542 --> 15:55.771
DNA extraction at these
temperatures is fiddly.

15:56.478 --> 15:57.930
I've just got a new
bit of new kit,

15:57.949 --> 16:00.549
a Phenol Chloroform Extractor,
could be just the ticket.

16:00.568 --> 16:02.047
I've been wanting to give it a whirl.

16:02.066 --> 16:03.383
How long to get a result?

16:03.402 --> 16:04.876
Err... About two or three weeks.

16:04.895 --> 16:06.375
Not fast enough Ralph.

16:40.559 --> 16:43.808
It's Clayton, I want you
to run a plate through the PNC.

16:44.539 --> 16:46.007
So... any plans this weekend?

16:46.555 --> 16:48.384
Depends how long this goes on.

16:48.494 --> 16:50.716
Harry's taking me
for dinner tonight.

16:50.735 --> 16:53.686
Sorry Ralph, you're not gonna
get to use your new toy.

16:54.051 --> 16:57.207
Our barbecued friend is
Damien Richards.

16:57.383 --> 17:00.762
Loan shark, arrests for
assault and suspected murder.

17:00.934 --> 17:03.236
Let's find out
who might have owed him money.

17:23.279 --> 17:24.999
- Hey.
- Hello.

17:27.848 --> 17:29.681
I'm almost done here,

17:29.700 --> 17:31.195
do you mind waiting
here for a moment?

17:31.214 --> 17:32.117
Of course not.

17:32.135 --> 17:33.173
Okay.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.086
Sir. Sorry to interrupt.

17:35.302 --> 17:37.524
This is one of my
officers, Steve Orwell.

17:37.543 --> 17:39.349
- Hello.
- Isabella Augustin.

17:39.509 --> 17:43.068
My err, girlfriend,
can I say that?

17:43.287 --> 17:45.444
I think you just did.

17:46.002 --> 17:48.075
Nice to meet you.
Sir, we've had some luck.

17:48.094 --> 17:51.753
Err, Ralph's managed to pull some
prints off the passenger door

17:51.920 --> 17:53.201
of Damien Richard's car.

17:53.862 --> 17:56.579
The man who left them is now
our number one suspect.

17:56.814 --> 17:58.654
- Are they known to us?
- Uh-huh.

17:59.134 --> 18:01.789
Alright err, stick it on the
board and let Harry know.

18:03.195 --> 18:05.594
So I just have to run
upstairs and see the Commander.

18:05.613 --> 18:07.048
Make yourself comfortable.

18:18.103 --> 18:19.405
Steve?

18:19.590 --> 18:21.705
<i>We got some prints
off the burnt-out car.</i>

18:22.183 --> 18:23.675
We're looking for a Bill Martin.

18:23.694 --> 18:25.316
No address yet but
we're working on it.

18:25.334 --> 18:26.516
I've just sent you his photo.

18:28.552 --> 18:30.963
Oh Jesus Bill. What
have you done?

18:31.496 --> 18:32.720
Nice one Steve.

19:40.653 --> 19:41.556
Eve.

19:41.575 --> 19:43.436
I need you to track
the location of a phone.

19:43.454 --> 19:45.876
Don't you have that little doe-eyed
sergeant to run around after you?

19:46.709 --> 19:49.388
<i>Isabella has access to MIS records,</i>

19:49.407 --> 19:51.409
I can't risk her
getting to this guy before me.

19:51.487 --> 19:53.302
What makes you think
I can get the address?

19:55.014 --> 19:57.111
Because you're beautiful and
resourceful

19:57.540 --> 19:59.382
and hate Isabella more than I do.

20:05.014 --> 20:06.436
Give me twenty-four hours.

20:06.645 --> 20:07.812
You've got five minutes.

20:13.878 --> 20:15.026
Sorry about that.

20:15.045 --> 20:16.077
Don't worry.

20:16.633 --> 20:18.929
I actually just had a call
from a friend,

20:19.224 --> 20:20.341
she's in a mess.

20:20.360 --> 20:24.116
I think I really need to give
her some moral support.

20:24.783 --> 20:26.165
Is it okay if we meet later?

20:26.262 --> 20:28.142
Sure. Of course, no problem.

20:28.270 --> 20:30.452
I'll call you when I'm done. Yeah?

20:30.534 --> 20:31.810
I'll see you later.

20:45.630 --> 20:47.949
Harry your in luck.
I've got your man.

20:48.364 --> 20:50.992
<i>His GPS shows him in a
warehouse in White City.</i>

20:51.096 --> 20:52.171
Thanks.

21:06.591 --> 21:08.013
Rich, this is not a great time...

21:08.134 --> 21:09.636
Your mate Suri's here.

21:09.654 --> 21:12.118
She said you promised
to take her out for dinner.

21:12.679 --> 21:14.082
I've been held up at work.

21:14.414 --> 21:15.525
<i>Brilliant.</i>

21:15.854 --> 21:18.156
Can you take her to dinner? I made a
reservation at Trinity Square.

21:18.254 --> 21:21.600
Oh. You want to me to take
her out for you?!

21:21.619 --> 21:22.918
I'll join you later.

21:42.094 --> 21:43.236
You're a police officer?

21:43.254 --> 21:46.957
Did you owe Damien Richards, seventy
seven and a half thousand pounds?

21:47.696 --> 21:48.656
Bill.

21:49.615 --> 21:51.198
Bill!

21:54.599 --> 21:55.480
Bill!

21:55.511 --> 21:56.997
Stop, this is stupid!

22:10.485 --> 22:11.568
Bill.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.721
I know why you killed him.

22:19.002 --> 22:20.860
It's time to stop running.

23:05.559 --> 23:06.783
Bill.

23:07.664 --> 23:08.759
Don't!

23:08.807 --> 23:11.735
You stay away! I've gotta,
I've gotta to do this.

23:12.261 --> 23:15.733
I was scared,
my DNA was all over that car,

23:15.752 --> 23:17.090
you couldn't understand.

23:17.431 --> 23:18.333
Why?

23:19.343 --> 23:22.978
Because you've messed things up so
badly you'll can't put them right.

23:26.191 --> 23:29.009
He was gonna kill me!
It was self defence.

23:29.823 --> 23:32.156
Listen to me Bill.
I lost my wife,

23:33.793 --> 23:35.308
my daughter, my home.

23:36.095 --> 23:38.978
What's gonna happen to my family
if I go to prison?

23:39.247 --> 23:41.616
If I die, at least they get
the insurance.

23:42.277 --> 23:44.563
That no consolation Bill
for any of them.

23:46.551 --> 23:47.821
Take my hand.

23:55.524 --> 23:56.675
Okay.

23:57.619 --> 23:58.406
Harry!

23:58.425 --> 23:59.287
That's it.

25:11.031 --> 25:12.910
Sorry, I'll switch it off.

25:13.314 --> 25:15.874
It's fine, take it.

25:17.663 --> 25:18.742
Yes.

25:19.007 --> 25:20.930
You will go down for this.

25:21.160 --> 25:23.410
I will see that you spend the rest
of your natural life

25:23.429 --> 25:24.751
<i>rotting in a cell.</i>

25:24.872 --> 25:28.477
I know it feels unfair now,
because you liked him,

25:28.864 --> 25:31.572
but you'll see that everything will
turn out the way it's meant to.

25:31.591 --> 25:33.573
He didn't deserve to die!

25:33.592 --> 25:34.766
I'll call you later.

25:36.831 --> 25:37.891
Is she okay?

25:37.910 --> 25:39.710
Bless her, she will be fine.

26:11.511 --> 26:14.426
This is the CCTV Footage.
Camera's everywhere.

26:14.445 --> 26:15.453
Destroy it!

26:15.472 --> 26:16.547
You can't do this.

26:16.566 --> 26:17.535
I have no choice.

26:17.554 --> 26:18.583
No <i>you</i> can't do this.

26:18.602 --> 26:20.290
You're a police officer.
It would be the end of you.

26:20.309 --> 26:23.570
Then what happens?
She kills again, and again.

26:23.671 --> 26:26.414
The law can't touch her,
I'm the only person who can.

26:26.591 --> 26:27.574
I'll do it.

26:27.592 --> 26:28.653
It's my responsibility.

26:28.671 --> 26:31.069
No. It's my responsibility.
I created her.

26:31.746 --> 26:33.851
- I put the bracelet on her wrist.
- Yes.

26:34.017 --> 26:36.059
But you put this one on mine.

26:36.425 --> 26:37.600
Please.

26:57.111 --> 26:59.454
I'll have the paella, please.

26:59.990 --> 27:01.108
Me too.

27:08.622 --> 27:11.820
Cheer up,
probably made a lucky escape.

27:12.026 --> 27:13.684
He's a disaster to date.

27:13.703 --> 27:14.765
What?

27:14.951 --> 27:18.373
To be honest, you probably shouldn't
be dating your boss, should you?

27:18.391 --> 27:20.333
Particularly not one who's
still in love with his ex.

27:20.351 --> 27:22.413
Date Harry? Are you kidding me?

27:22.791 --> 27:24.173
We're just mates.

27:24.254 --> 27:25.311
Right.

27:25.391 --> 27:27.185
I'm not dating anyone at work,
again.

27:27.351 --> 27:29.413
Trust me and if I was,
it wouldn't be Harry Clayton.

27:29.431 --> 27:30.794
What's that supposed to mean?

27:30.837 --> 27:32.189
What's wrong with my brother?

27:32.389 --> 27:35.210
If it was down to you.
I'd still be in jail!

27:37.951 --> 27:41.133
Sir. The paella's gonna be another
twenty minutes, is that alright?

27:41.151 --> 27:42.172
Brilliant.

29:26.871 --> 29:28.973
What are you doing here?
Did Harry send you?

29:30.927 --> 29:32.128
Whatever you do,

29:33.072 --> 29:35.132
however you try
to get his attention,

29:36.176 --> 29:38.395
Harry's never going to love you.

30:00.831 --> 30:03.748
Rich, morning.
Sorry about last night.

30:05.289 --> 30:06.492
Rise and shine.

30:06.511 --> 30:08.491
Oh, Holy shit!

30:10.411 --> 30:11.634
Morning...

30:13.197 --> 30:14.753
Morning!

30:25.711 --> 30:28.293
Can I ask you what your intentions
are towards my brother?

30:28.311 --> 30:32.093
Only, he's a delicate flower,
I wouldn't like to see him get hurt.

30:32.111 --> 30:35.033
I'm not going to date your brother,
that would be too weird.

30:36.103 --> 30:37.383
Is he single though?

30:38.199 --> 30:40.261
What do you care if you're
not going to date him?

30:40.351 --> 30:41.672
I don't.

30:43.080 --> 30:44.225
Is he though?

31:01.117 --> 31:04.657
The victim's the same guy who left
his prints on Damien Richards' car.

31:05.631 --> 31:08.591
He kills Damien Richards,
someone kills him.

31:10.071 --> 31:11.631
It's not a pretty sight.

31:28.511 --> 31:31.869
Bill Martin kills his loan shark,

31:33.180 --> 31:34.454
then he's killed.

31:35.845 --> 31:37.153
So what do we think?

31:37.492 --> 31:38.674
Revenge?

31:40.032 --> 31:42.756
Damien Richards' brother's got form.

31:44.278 --> 31:45.417
Sergeant!

31:46.799 --> 31:48.362
We have started.

31:48.911 --> 31:51.782
I've been onto Bill Martins
mobile phone provider.

31:51.801 --> 31:54.053
Sir, perhaps I should talk to you
about this in private.

31:54.071 --> 31:55.901
About his phone records?

31:56.147 --> 31:57.333
No tell me now.

31:57.351 --> 31:59.111
The last number he called is registered

31:59.130 --> 32:02.137
to an Isabella Augustin,
Villa Mansions, West London.

32:08.231 --> 32:10.013
What is it about?
Is something the matter?

32:10.031 --> 32:12.213
Do you know a man
named Bill Martin?

32:12.231 --> 32:13.474
No.

32:13.493 --> 32:15.596
Well he called
your mobile yesterday.

32:15.743 --> 32:17.427
I don't think so.

32:17.932 --> 32:19.693
Did you have
your phone on you all day?

32:19.711 --> 32:20.777
I did,

32:21.023 --> 32:23.880
and I certainly didn't speak
to anyone named Bill.

32:24.390 --> 32:27.093
It's just according to his service
provider, there was a call

32:27.111 --> 32:30.119
between his mobile and yours
for approximately two minutes.

32:32.216 --> 32:34.372
And what does it matter
that he called me?

32:34.391 --> 32:36.471
Bill Martin was murdered yesterday.

32:38.604 --> 32:40.013
Would you mind
if we had a look around?

32:40.031 --> 32:41.479
No. No. Go ahead.

33:03.831 --> 33:06.037
We won't get
the DNA results for a while,

33:07.016 --> 33:08.716
but it's a match for

33:08.735 --> 33:10.233
Bill Martin's blood type.

33:12.710 --> 33:16.861
A search of the area surrounding
Isabella Augustin's apartment block,

33:16.880 --> 33:20.185
produced this in a commercial bin
down the street.

33:21.551 --> 33:25.191
The blood is also a match for
Bill Martin's blood type.

33:26.015 --> 33:29.585
Well erm... obviously I need to
recuse myself from...

33:31.227 --> 33:32.652
this situation.

33:32.671 --> 33:34.107
Harry, will you lead?

33:35.231 --> 33:37.608
I'm afraid I need to recuse myself
as well.

33:39.631 --> 33:41.093
What do you mean? Why?

33:42.110 --> 33:43.713
I only just realised when I

33:44.912 --> 33:46.932
saw her photo,
but I know Isabella.

33:46.951 --> 33:48.367
Only by her first name.

33:52.671 --> 33:54.213
How do you know her?!

33:54.871 --> 33:57.813
We both go to the same organisation
that... helps us deal with

33:57.831 --> 33:59.493
our gambling issues.

34:01.157 --> 34:03.358
It protects its members anonymity.

34:04.432 --> 34:06.420
That's why I didn't recognise
her surname.

34:09.791 --> 34:12.213
Isabella is in Gamblers' Anonymous?

34:12.563 --> 34:14.284
The victim was a member too.

34:15.831 --> 34:18.231
Did they know each other?

34:19.902 --> 34:22.551
I've seen them at the same meetings.

34:40.942 --> 34:42.226
Alistair I'm sorry.

34:47.031 --> 34:48.804
I feel like I hardly know her.

34:49.842 --> 34:51.250
Do you think she...

34:51.792 --> 34:54.103
did it? Do you think
she could be the murderer?

34:54.447 --> 34:56.067
Everyone's capable of murder.

34:57.259 --> 34:58.752
First law of our job.

35:14.351 --> 35:16.333
How can you subject me to this?

35:17.221 --> 35:18.772
You don't get it, do you?

35:19.638 --> 35:22.276
This is the kindest way I could
deal with you.

35:23.219 --> 35:24.497
It's mercy.

35:25.503 --> 35:28.303
Something you showed
none of your victims.

35:32.199 --> 35:33.759
I don't want that mercy.

35:42.339 --> 35:44.449
No, what I'm saying is,
stop shutting me out.

35:44.467 --> 35:46.752
- I hardly do that.
- It's all you do.

35:46.771 --> 35:48.596
About Daisy, about your marriage

35:48.615 --> 35:50.690
I mean it's like suddenly
I don't have clearance.

35:50.709 --> 35:53.467
Well to be honest, my family doesn't
have anything to do with you.

35:55.088 --> 35:56.205
Oh God.

36:07.107 --> 36:09.307
Alright Johnny.
Erm... is Anna there?

36:10.489 --> 36:12.569
Anna, it's Harry!

36:13.307 --> 36:14.904
Actually I'm here to see Daisy.

36:15.537 --> 36:17.020
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

36:25.738 --> 36:28.188
A C minus? I don't believe it.

36:28.387 --> 36:30.669
I'm never letting you help me
do my homework again.

36:31.355 --> 36:33.808
I'm getting a remark.
History's my special subject.

36:33.827 --> 36:36.951
It's alright, Jonny's helped me
do my GCSE chemistry.

36:37.313 --> 36:38.438
Got me an A.

36:39.067 --> 36:41.962
Well that's because Johnny's just
finished doing his GCSE's himself.

36:46.067 --> 36:47.487
Does that happen a lot?

36:48.317 --> 36:50.087
- What do you want me to do?
- I don't know.

36:50.106 --> 36:51.524
I really don't know.

36:54.946 --> 36:56.972
I did something terrible today.

36:59.507 --> 37:01.360
I planted evidence on someone,

37:02.414 --> 37:03.600
they're guilty, but

37:04.917 --> 37:07.647
no police officer would ever
be able to prove it.

37:08.587 --> 37:09.772
Isabella.

37:13.467 --> 37:14.529
Well, what do you expect?

37:14.547 --> 37:17.236
You told me to keep away from her,
so of course I went to see her.

37:19.979 --> 37:23.956
She convinced me
that the bracelet was real.

37:26.483 --> 37:28.034
She could've killed you.

37:28.693 --> 37:29.928
She's unbalanced.

37:29.947 --> 37:31.330
Yeah I gathered that.

37:33.742 --> 37:35.210
I'm fine,

37:38.012 --> 37:39.473
it's you I'm worried about.

37:41.923 --> 37:43.923
I feel like I've crossed a line.

37:47.235 --> 37:48.338
So

37:52.047 --> 37:53.396
what's new?

37:58.849 --> 38:02.808
I am the victim of false evidence,
implicating me in a crime

38:02.827 --> 38:04.649
of which I am entirely innocent.

38:04.666 --> 38:07.801
I have provided proof
for all my exact movements

38:07.820 --> 38:11.162
through the last twenty-four hours,
including an extended period of time

38:11.387 --> 38:14.224
<i>in the company
of your detective superintendent.</i>

38:14.667 --> 38:17.057
<i>DSI Winter has recused himself</i>

38:17.475 --> 38:19.167
<i>from this investigation.</i>

38:25.264 --> 38:26.424
I'm sorry. Sorry.

38:50.348 --> 38:51.932
So let's continue.

38:59.682 --> 39:00.742
Ralph,

39:01.571 --> 39:04.242
how sure are you
Bill Martin's watch

39:04.261 --> 39:05.992
broke during the attack?

39:06.187 --> 39:09.369
Well it's impossible to be a hundred
percent, but it's very common

39:09.387 --> 39:11.121
damage from a defensive move.

39:11.140 --> 39:12.249
Why is this relevant?

39:12.267 --> 39:15.089
Because if Bill Martin's watch got
smashed while he was being murdered,

39:15.107 --> 39:18.357
then how did he call Isabella
Augustin thirty minutes later?

39:24.347 --> 39:25.777
Sir...

39:26.592 --> 39:29.335
Look if this is about the
Isabella Augustin case,

39:29.354 --> 39:30.929
I can't hear about it.

39:30.947 --> 39:32.329
You should see this.

39:32.846 --> 39:36.281
This is a forensic time line
of Bill Martin's death

39:36.616 --> 39:40.345
and this is a time line
of Isabella Augustin's movements.

39:41.161 --> 39:43.408
How sure are you
of this time of death?

39:43.427 --> 39:45.825
So far we've have a stopped watch.

39:46.147 --> 39:48.209
Well that's not good enough,
not nearly good enough.

39:48.227 --> 39:49.899
But I went through

39:49.918 --> 39:52.870
the CCTV on the street
where the murder weapon was found.

39:56.107 --> 39:57.529
Do you think that's the murder
weapon?

39:57.547 --> 39:58.450
It could be.

39:58.468 --> 40:01.801
This is the same motorcyclist
leaving Isabella's apartment.

40:02.235 --> 40:05.887
This is the same woman, we saw
driving away from the warehouse

40:05.906 --> 40:07.557
where Bill Martin's
body was found.

40:08.867 --> 40:11.891
Why would this woman
want to frame Isabella?

40:13.257 --> 40:15.083
Her name is Eve Alexandri.

40:15.474 --> 40:17.729
I know her from Gamblers' Anonymous.
I...

40:17.747 --> 40:20.652
I tried to help her
get some clean time,

40:21.505 --> 40:24.264
but the draw of the casinos
was too great for her.

40:25.564 --> 40:28.145
She couldn't forgive me
for getting clean.

40:28.987 --> 40:32.099
I didn't realise it for a long time,
but she has psychotic episodes.

40:33.561 --> 40:36.396
She believed that I had an ability to

40:36.658 --> 40:38.849
control where the roulette
ball would land.

40:39.697 --> 40:41.337
It's ridiculous, I know.

40:45.427 --> 40:49.593
<i>She threatened to destroy my life
if I didn't share my 'powers' with her.</i>

40:51.427 --> 40:53.307
Get me the custody sergeant.

40:59.435 --> 41:00.533
I should go.

41:01.506 --> 41:03.396
I don't want Daisy
to find us here.

41:04.827 --> 41:06.489
I think she'd be pleased.

41:07.256 --> 41:08.303
Yeah.

41:09.914 --> 41:11.934
But I don't want to get her hopes up,

41:13.088 --> 41:15.608
until we sort out what we want.

41:20.027 --> 41:21.141
What do you want?

41:21.488 --> 41:23.495
I've never made any secret of that.

41:30.867 --> 41:32.478
It's still early you know.

41:35.196 --> 41:36.688
I could take you out for dinner.

41:45.210 --> 41:46.224
Alright.

41:55.538 --> 41:56.606
Thanks.

41:58.570 --> 42:00.648
Look I'm really sorry
about what happened.

42:00.667 --> 42:02.478
Oh, don't worry about it.

42:02.663 --> 42:05.200
You were all just
doing your job.

42:05.627 --> 42:08.489
I'll let you know as soon as
they've apprehended Alexandri.

42:08.697 --> 42:09.577
Good.

42:12.147 --> 42:13.361
Shall we have dinner?

42:13.587 --> 42:15.107
I'd love that.

42:15.892 --> 42:18.429
There's one or two errands I need
to run though.

42:20.056 --> 42:21.440
Lunch tomorrow?

42:22.227 --> 42:23.278
I'd like that.

42:23.527 --> 42:24.696
Me too.

42:29.085 --> 42:30.450
- See you.
- See ya'.

42:50.762 --> 42:51.893
<i>Harry it's me.</i>

42:52.404 --> 42:53.639
I'm off duty, Suri.

42:53.787 --> 42:56.328
I need to talk to you
about Eve Alexandri.

43:00.314 --> 43:02.113
<i>I think she framed
Isabella Augustin</i>

43:02.132 --> 43:03.554
for the murder of Bill Martin.

43:04.304 --> 43:05.536
Have you told this to anyone else?

43:05.592 --> 43:08.128
<i>Winter. He just released Isabella.</i>

43:08.226 --> 43:09.205
What?!

43:09.399 --> 43:11.733
<i>Do you think Eve Alexandri</i>

43:11.810 --> 43:13.154
killed Bill Martin?

43:13.867 --> 43:14.980
Oh shit!

43:15.659 --> 43:16.603
<i>Harry?</i>

43:17.219 --> 43:18.379
Slow down, Harry!

43:18.547 --> 43:19.781
I'm trying, the brakes!

43:28.329 --> 43:30.609
- You okay?
- Jesus, what happened?

43:31.263 --> 43:34.089
Stay in the car. Whatever happens.

43:34.107 --> 43:35.689
Do not get out of the car.

43:35.707 --> 43:36.747
What's going on?

43:37.098 --> 43:37.948
Harry?

43:42.507 --> 43:43.883
Show yourself!

43:44.829 --> 43:46.850
I know you're here!

43:46.867 --> 43:48.591
Harry what the hell are you doing?

43:50.547 --> 43:52.744
Stay in the car!

44:13.274 --> 44:14.342
Oh no.

44:20.825 --> 44:24.032
Harry? Harry? Come on Harry.

44:33.002 --> 44:34.970
Harry! Come on!

44:40.842 --> 44:42.773
No... he's dead.

44:57.947 --> 45:00.827
Harry Clayton was
electrocuted last night.

45:03.955 --> 45:06.431
Oh. What a terrible way to die.

45:07.605 --> 45:09.307
There was a car
tailing us that night.

45:09.326 --> 45:11.670
And I'm pretty sure I know
who was in it.

45:12.757 --> 45:15.429
But I'm officially done
being kept in the dark.

45:16.768 --> 45:19.308
Give me a printout of all
the cases Harry Clayton

45:19.326 --> 45:21.846
investigated
over the last three months.

45:22.524 --> 45:24.067
I didn't want to kill Harry.

45:24.558 --> 45:26.628
But he made it impossible
for me not to.

45:26.876 --> 45:28.220
You're alone now.

45:28.327 --> 45:29.585
For good.

45:30.846 --> 45:32.387
Sir, what the hell is going on?

45:32.406 --> 45:35.409
Watch your tone, Suri.
Remember who's in charge here.

45:36.526 --> 45:37.469
Where is the bracelet?

45:37.550 --> 45:39.269
I did something stupid...
