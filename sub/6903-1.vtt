<i>HEX:
War and me took to each other real well.</i>

01:28.665 --> 01:30.155
<i>It felt like it had meaning.</i>

01:36.540 --> 01:38.974
<i>The feeling of doing
what you thought was right.</i>

01:44.147 --> 01:46.012
<i>But it wasn't.</i>

01:51.688 --> 01:53.315
<i>Folks can believe what they like...</i>

01:53.490 --> 01:57.859
<i>...but eventually a man's gotta decide
if he's goanna do what's right.</i>

<i>That choice cost me
more than I bargained for.</i>

02:39.936 --> 02:41.733
- Daddy!
- Son!

02:42.506 --> 02:44.565
Brave boy.

02:44.741 --> 02:47.733
My son Jeb was brave. Loyal too.

02:47.911 --> 02:51.176
And then he was murdered
by his best friend in cold blood.

02:51.348 --> 02:52.713
Isn't that right, Hex?

02:52.883 --> 02:54.180
Turnbull, let them go.

02:55.018 --> 02:58.078
Son, you are not fit to wear this uniform.

02:58.255 --> 03:00.120
You're a coward and a traitor.

03:00.524 --> 03:03.584
Fine. I am.

03:03.760 --> 03:05.284
It's got nothing to do with them.

03:05.462 --> 03:06.929
- Of course it does.
HEX: No.

03:07.097 --> 03:08.860
You killed the only family I had.

03:09.032 --> 03:11.000
No. General, please, don't do this.

03:11.168 --> 03:14.569
Betrayed your own men
and you murdered my son.

03:14.738 --> 03:17.002
I'm begging you, sir. I'm begging you.

03:17.174 --> 03:21.235
You took everything that I love,
Jonah Hex.

03:21.411 --> 03:22.878
You know what that feels like?

03:23.046 --> 03:24.604
Don't do this.

03:24.781 --> 03:26.874
It feels like this.

03:27.884 --> 03:29.112
I want you to watch.

03:29.286 --> 03:30.753
No! No!

Free to walk this earth
with a mark on your flesh.

04:03.019 --> 04:06.284
And every day,
that mark will remind you...

and cut me down...</i>

04:31.515 --> 04:33.210

<i>Those medicine men did
what they could to bring me back...</i>

04:36.987 --> 04:39.615
<i>...but somehow they just couldn't
get me all the way out.</i>

04:39.790 --> 04:42.884
<i>And crows seemed to stay with me.</i>

04:43.994 --> 04:45.427
<i>Didn't make me immortal.</i>

04:45.595 --> 04:49.463
<i>Just left me with the curse
of knowing the other side.</i>

04:52.602 --> 04:55.935
<i>See, talking to dead folks isn’t natural.</i>

04:56.106 --> 04:58.870
<i>But sometimes they're the only ones
who will point the way.</i>

05:02.112 --> 05:07.243
<i>I searched this land high and low,
hunting old Turnbull down.</i>

05:08.018 --> 05:14.423
<i>But then that old bastard played one
final trick on me and died in a hotel fire.</i>

05:15.525 --> 05:18.983
<i>The man that took my family was dead.</i>

05:20.363 --> 05:23.855
<i>I had nowhere to go
and a heart full of vengeance.</i>

05:24.034 --> 05:27.800
<i>I did what come natural
and turned to bounty hunting.</i>

06:59.763 --> 07:01.924
Appear we have a little problem, Mr. Hex.

07:02.098 --> 07:05.261
There's four Clayton boys.
This only three boys.

07:05.769 --> 07:08.499
I don't see my way we could

07:34.931 --> 07:37.627
Transaction's all it was.

07:38.001 --> 07:40.868
I'll collect my $100 bounty on them
and be on my way.

07:41.037 --> 07:45.531
That there, Mr. Hex,
was more of a limited-time offer.

07:45.709 --> 07:47.472
But you'll pay it all the same.

07:47.644 --> 07:50.511
Oh, hell, Mr. Hex.

07:50.680 --> 07:57.313
There's an unscrupulous man or two would
pay double that for your stinking hide.

Positive, President Grant.

13:49.505 --> 13:51.871
Bastard must've faked his own death.

13:52.041 --> 13:54.066
- Why now?
GRANT: I can hazard a guess.

13:54.577 --> 13:58.274
There are centennial celebrations
being prepared in more than 20 states.

All we can confirm is that Turnbull
took something off that train.

14:48.831 --> 14:53.029
And that he broke into the U.S. Armoury
in Virginia a week before that.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.733
- Summerland, Virginia?
- Yes, sir.

14:56.372 --> 14:57.464
He's building it.

- The plans were never completed.
- He's building the weapon.

<i>And he paid a terrible price for it.</i>

I don't recall a first or last.

Why don't we call this one number one?

You killed them lawmen.

They was wearing badges,
but not one of them was no lawman.

We can go somewhere.

I may not be here.

- Hex, you've got to come with us.
- No.

that you're special.

- Oh, we know.

22:22.785 --> 22:26.346

is why we're even bothering with you.

Let me show you something.

22:49.912 --> 22:52.005
Now, you listen to me, bounty hunter.

22:52.181 --> 22:55.617
I have quality intelligence that says
Turnbull and his band of bastards...

22:55.784 --> 22:57.547
...are headed to Springfield, Georgia.

22:57.720 --> 23:00.814
And how'd you come by this quality...

23:00.990 --> 23:02.719
What'd you call it?

23:02.892 --> 23:05.588
- Intelligence.
- Right.

23:07.229 --> 23:09.720
Turnbull's men assaulted
one of our trains.

23:09.899 --> 23:13.665
Yet we did manage to overcome
this one deadly outlaw.

23:13.936 --> 23:16.097
Told us everything we needed to know.

23:16.272 --> 23:19.105
Unfortunately he died
during our interrogation.

23:20.276 --> 23:22.540
I want to talk to him.

23:23.145 --> 23:24.703
He's dead, Hex.

23:24.880 --> 23:27.906
Yeah, I'll have a word with him
all the same.

23:41.897 --> 23:43.865
How you doing there?

23:44.333 --> 23:46.995
- What's happening to me?
- Afraid you're dead, friend.

23:47.169 --> 23:48.534
How can you speak to me?

23:48.704 --> 23:51.832
Well, it's kind of a knack I picked up
when I near died myself.

23:52.007 --> 23:54.669
{SIZZLING}

23:57.513 --> 23:58.844
I can make it stop.

23:59.982 --> 24:01.950
Just need to get some information first.

24:02.117 --> 24:05.177
You see, what I done to you is unnatural.

24:05.354 --> 24:09.484
I keep you out of the ground too long,
you're likely to just burn right on up.

24:09.959 --> 24:13.861
And it seems like the fresher dead you are,
the quicker it happens.

24:14.196 --> 24:17.029
Being dead, you can see
the comings and goings...

24:17.199 --> 24:19.394
...of anyone you knew
when you was alive.

24:19.568 --> 24:20.660
What do you want?

24:21.770 --> 24:23.533
I'm looking for Quentin Turnbull.

24:24.073 --> 24:25.506
Never knew Turnbull.

24:25.674 --> 24:28.472
- Who recruited you?
- Make the pain stop.

24:28.644 --> 24:31.010
- Who?
- Make the pain stop.

24:32.581 --> 24:34.173

24:37.252 --> 24:38.719

- What?

24:38.887 --> 24:41.355
<i>Royal Slocum.</i>

24:44.560 --> 24:46.721
- Where?
- Runs a fight tent.

24:46.895 --> 24:48.226
Down in South Carolina.

25:02.845 --> 25:04.870

What is that sound?

25:14.156 --> 25:16.317
Oh, them?

25:16.492 --> 25:19.518
Theme’s likely hellhounds.

25:20.696 --> 25:22.823
Reckon they smell fresh meat.

25:22.998 --> 25:25.466
Waiting for you for when I let you go,
no doubt.

25:25.634 --> 25:27.795
No. No.

25:27.970 --> 25:30.200
I wouldn't try to pet them if I was you.

25:35.677 --> 25:37.076
I'm headed southeast.

- Ask him yourself.

Mr. Turnbull, sir.

26:43.479 --> 26:45.572
I'm not sure I can deliver
what you're asking.

26:45.747 --> 26:51.185
The reason I'm sure you'll provide what
I'm requesting is because it profits you.

26:51.353 --> 26:54.117
And, son, you're no more capable
of turning down a profit...

26:54.289 --> 26:56.587
...than a maggot is
of turning down a carcass.

26:56.758 --> 27:02.287
Don't worry. You're free to continue your
double-dealing in the Capitol backrooms...

27:02.464 --> 27:05.991
...over fine cigars and 200-year-old malt.

27:07.002 --> 27:09.971
But you'll continue to do
what I ask of you.

27:10.139 --> 27:11.902
Mr. Turnbull...

27:12.407 --> 27:15.899
...I've given you the routes
for every top-secret shipment...

...location of the plans...

27:17.713 --> 27:19.977
...but this, sir, I really...

27:23.051 --> 27:25.019
The hour is approaching.

27:25.187 --> 27:28.884
Make no mistake, this country
will not see its second century.

27:29.258 --> 27:32.091
And when America is in flames...

27:32.261 --> 27:34.923
...you will be glad that you chose wisely.

27:38.567 --> 27:43.231

Don't seem like much.

28:07.563 --> 28:11.624
Aye, but they'll turn the world
to dust all the same.

28:11.800 --> 28:13.028
Marvellous.

28:13.202 --> 28:15.568
Take them, boys. But be careful.

28:15.904 --> 28:17.929
Wouldn't want to drop them.

- The soldiers are all dead.

28:35.390 --> 28:37.290
- What is this?
- Oh, we found this one...

28:37.459 --> 28:39.620
...with shoulder boards on his coat.

28:40.529 --> 28:42.861
Please. Let the innocents go.

This is what y'all been waiting for,
you degenerate bastards!

29:23.739 --> 29:27.266
In this corner, the Barbarian.

29:27.442 --> 29:31.173
And in this corner,
from halfway across the world:

29:31.346 --> 29:32.745
The Snake-Man.

29:33.081 --> 29:36.448
- Feed him the rattlesnake venom.

29:46.128 --> 29:48.528
- Nice pastime you got here, colonel.
- Hex.

29:50.699 --> 29:51.961
Come on, come on, come on.

29:53.568 --> 29:55.365
- Yeah!
- Go on.

29:56.238 --> 29:58.035
Get it done already.

30:01.376 --> 30:02.570
You don't mean to kill me.

30:02.744 --> 30:06.077
I haven't made up my mind.
Let's see how this little visit goes.

30:13.488 --> 30:14.853
I'm looking for Turnbull.

30:15.023 --> 30:18.857
Shit, Turnbull's dead.
You know that good as anyone.

30:19.027 --> 30:21.359
The government said
he didn't burn in no fire.

30:23.265 --> 30:26.063
You're chasing ghosts.
You should let this go.

30:27.869 --> 30:30.463
You put your best friend in the grave.

30:30.639 --> 30:32.072
You betrayed your regiment.

30:32.908 --> 30:36.036
For what? Honour?

30:36.211 --> 30:39.874
There's no honour in war.
War is killing, simple as that.

30:42.951 --> 30:45.078
This country could've been ours.

30:45.253 --> 30:46.686
Those days are long passed.

30:51.493 --> 30:53.324
What if I told you it's not too late?

30:53.495 --> 30:56.953
That we could still bring
this unholy union of states to its knees.

31:00.168 --> 31:01.931
Don't you want a second chance?

31:03.872 --> 31:05.635
All right.

31:06.141 --> 31:08.371
I've decided I am goanna kill you.

31:09.411 --> 31:12.778
I kind of thought that might be
your sentiments on the matter.

31:14.950 --> 31:16.645

31:17.185 --> 31:19.085
Toss him in.

31:27.729 --> 31:28.753
...where's Turnbull?

31:28.930 --> 31:31.296
Why don't you ask your dead friend Jeb?

31:31.466 --> 31:35.095
- I reckon you can catch up with him in hell.
- You know, colonel...

31:37.005 --> 31:39.405
What a mighty good idea.

31:52.921 --> 31:55.856

31:56.291 --> 31:58.987
- Get him in the cage!

34:31.980 --> 34:33.947
Good to see you again too, Jeb.

34:34.114 --> 34:36.675
If I let you up, you promise
you won't punch me again?

34:37.152 --> 34:39.916
Well, seems like a losing proposition
if I don't.

34:40.088 --> 34:41.315
I want your word, Jeb.

34:41.489 --> 34:44.947
- What makes you think that's any good?
- It was always good enough for me.

34:45.560 --> 34:46.754
Go on, then.

34:47.495 --> 34:49.156
All right.

34:56.137 --> 34:57.627
I need your help, Jeb.

34:57.806 --> 35:01.003
- You're kidding me, right? This is a joke.
- No.

35:01.176 --> 35:03.838
- You killed me, Jonah.
- You drew on me, Jeb.

35:04.012 --> 35:05.946
Yeah, well, that was a mistake.

35:06.114 --> 35:09.311
Well, obviously.

35:10.251 --> 35:14.551
- You disobeyed a direct order.
- To burn down a hospital.

35:14.923 --> 35:18.689
Your father was goanna murder
them people just to make a point.

35:19.160 --> 35:21.720
I couldn't stand for that.
I'm surprised that you could.

35:21.896 --> 35:24.228
He was our commanding officer.
He was my father.

35:24.599 --> 35:26.066
I didn't have a choice.

35:26.468 --> 35:28.459
Neither did I.

35:32.641 --> 35:34.768
I'm sorry about it.

35:36.711 --> 35:38.201
Killing you, I mean.

35:38.647 --> 35:42.276
I never did expect things
would turn out that way.

35:43.385 --> 35:46.582
He took my family in your name, Jeb.

35:49.391 --> 35:51.359
He made me watch them die.

35:53.895 --> 35:56.261
I gotta find him, Jeb.

35:57.565 --> 35:59.533
I been watching you...

35:59.701 --> 36:02.135
...and I been watching him.

36:02.771 --> 36:05.638
It's getting real hard to tell
the difference between you two.

36:05.807 --> 36:08.799
- Your father is a monster, you hear me?
- And you isn’t?

36:11.179 --> 36:13.113
From where I sit...

36:13.281 --> 36:18.309
...you're just two men bent on murdering
folks to make your own pain go away.

36:18.953 --> 36:22.787
Living life like that, that sounds
a hell of a lot like being damned.

36:24.759 --> 36:27.023
You know what he's capable of.

36:29.631 --> 36:31.792
Oh, Jonah.

36:32.367 --> 36:34.665
- He's at Fort Resurrection.
- Yeah?

36:34.836 --> 36:35.996
He's holed up there.

36:36.971 --> 36:40.429
I guess you two can probably
have it out once and for all.

36:40.608 --> 36:43.702
I gotta be honest with you,
I don't even know who I'm pulling for.

36:43.878 --> 36:46.813
Either way, you'll have company soon.

36:47.348 --> 36:49.976
Yeah, I suppose that's true.

36:51.352 --> 36:54.844
Hell. I'm starting to burn.

36:55.223 --> 36:58.192
I best be getting back underground.

37:01.596 --> 37:03.587
Now, you listen to me.

37:04.566 --> 37:07.899
They talk about you down here.
You do yourself a favour.

37:08.069 --> 37:11.300
You stay ahead of death
as long as you can, you hear?

37:11.473 --> 37:14.135
Because they got plans for you.

37:14.309 --> 37:15.333
Take care, Jeb.

37:19.214 --> 37:21.205
See you soon.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.798
He's never coming back for you.

he was in here?

37:47.175 --> 37:49.040
You're goanna have to get out of my room.

of old Jack Straw fair and legal.

37:53.915 --> 37:55.348

39:23.705 --> 39:27.368
Jonah, you and I both know the only
reason you fought for the South...

39:27.542 --> 39:30.739
...is you isn’t like being told
what to do by the government.

39:31.212 --> 39:33.112
You isn’t never believed in secessionism.

39:33.615 --> 39:36.413
And you isn’t never believed
in slavery neither.

39:36.584 --> 39:40.577
So, what's the point
in hating the Union so much?

39:41.289 --> 39:45.726
All of them on both sides is just a bunch
of hypocrites as far as I'm concerned.

39:46.427 --> 39:48.725

39:49.097 --> 39:50.894

39:51.199 --> 39:53.190
And what's good in it?

39:53.368 --> 39:55.836
- The future, that's what.
- No.

39:56.204 --> 40:00.163

we goanna go on up there to Washington...

40:00.341 --> 40:02.275

...men your colour skin and mine,
and listen to the president.

40:05.513 --> 40:08.971

and I'll keep to mine.

Do you know who Eli Whitney was?

41:38.473 --> 41:42.569
I'm a very undereducated man,
Mr. Turnbull.

41:42.744 --> 41:44.837
Are we talking about
Whitney Senior or Junior?

41:45.980 --> 41:47.345
Senior.

41:48.683 --> 41:52.312
After he invented the cotton gin
and started the Industrial Revolution...

41:52.487 --> 41:55.320
...he went to work for the U.S. military,
special projects.

41:55.490 --> 41:58.186
He pioneered the use
of component parts...

41:58.359 --> 42:01.487
<i>...and firearms,
new combustibles for munitions...</i>

42:01.662 --> 42:05.189
<i>...and more or less, he single-handedly
invented modern warfare.</i>

42:05.366 --> 42:07.095
<i>So as an exercise...</i>

42:07.268 --> 42:11.398
<i>...they ask him to design
a super-weapon, a nation killer.</i>

42:12.106 --> 42:15.132
<i>And this is what he envisaged,
but they never made it...</i>

42:15.309 --> 42:17.709
<i>...because once they
realized its potential...</i>

42:17.879 --> 42:21.713
...they decided that they could not
fathom wilfully visiting...

42:21.883 --> 42:25.580
<i>...that kind of devastation

01:10:02.894 --> 01:10:03.986
I want you to watch.

01:10:04.563 --> 01:10:06.690
Watch this.

01:10:46.204 --> 01:10:50.097
{PEOPLE OOHING WITH THE FIREWORKS}

01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:53.834
Happy Fourth of July.

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:17.227
Your reward.

01:11:20.138 --> 01:11:21.469
And full pardon.

01:11:22.741 --> 01:11:25.972
And I'd also like you to consider this.

01:11:30.882 --> 01:11:32.474
America needs a sheriff.

01:11:37.622 --> 01:11:41.820
I don't think countries
have sheriffs, exactly.

01:11:42.928 --> 01:11:44.555
Sir.

01:11:49.267 --> 01:11:52.031
Though if you get yourself into a jam...

01:11:52.203 --> 01:11:54.103
...I imagine you can find me.

01:12:02.004 --> 01:12:04.504
{THUNDER}

01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:06.681
He offer you a job?

01:12:07.752 --> 01:12:09.652
- Yep.
- You take it?

01:12:11.256 --> 01:12:14.020
No. I'm not big on having a boss.

01:12:28.406 --> 01:12:30.340
Sorry about it, Jeb.

01:12:58.136 --> 01:13:02.436
<i>HEX:
They say a man with vengeance
in his heart is supposed to dig two graves:</i>

01:13:02.607 --> 01:13:06.441
<i>One for his enemy and one for himself.</i>

01:13:06.611 --> 01:13:09.910
<i>Well, I guess mine will just have to wait.</i>
