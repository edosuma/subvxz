00:00.827 --> 00:03.295
<i>Lily has always
been one of those people</i>

00:03.296 --> 00:05.397
<i>who loves their birthday.
Loves it.</i>

00:06.433 --> 00:09.668
It's my birthday!

00:13.373 --> 00:16.207
<i>So it's a good thing
she married Marshall.</i>

00:17.277 --> 00:20.612
It's still my birthday!

00:20.613 --> 00:23.182
<i>Because he loves
planning birthdays.</i>

00:23.183 --> 00:26.018
<i>Feliz cumpleaños, baby.</i>

00:26.019 --> 00:28.420
The theme of this today's
birthday breakfast

00:28.421 --> 00:30.355
in bed is...

00:30.356 --> 00:32.156
"Spanish Interlude"

00:32.158 --> 00:33.892
♪ ♪

00:33.893 --> 00:35.527
Ooh!

00:35.528 --> 00:37.428
And...

00:37.931 --> 00:39.098
How on Earth did we end up

00:39.099 --> 00:42.201
in the lyrical rolling hills
of Northern Spain?

00:42.202 --> 00:43.469
Yay!

00:43.470 --> 00:46.238
Baby, tonight is going
to be so much fun.

00:46.239 --> 00:47.372
Just the five of us,

00:47.373 --> 00:49.408
black-tie dinner,
and Ted is picking up

00:49.409 --> 00:51.777
your favorite cognac pumpkin
cheesecake from Edgar's.

00:51.778 --> 00:52.744
Yay!

00:52.745 --> 00:53.912
Okay, I am off

00:53.913 --> 00:56.515
to run your super secret
birthday errand.

00:56.516 --> 00:57.716
Yay!

00:57.717 --> 01:00.652
And I'm taking
this guy with me

01:00.653 --> 01:02.621
because I don't like the way
he's looking at you.

01:02.622 --> 01:04.522
Yay.

01:07.060 --> 01:08.460
A new camera!

01:08.461 --> 01:11.130
Oh, thank you, Marshall.
I love it!

01:11.131 --> 01:12.498
Well, little bonus:

01:12.499 --> 01:15.434
I took some naked pictures
of myself before I wrapped it.

01:15.435 --> 01:16.735
Put a bow on it.

01:16.736 --> 01:18.270
There wasn't a bow on it.

01:18.271 --> 01:20.973
Wrong "it."

01:20.974 --> 01:22.307
Thank you, honey.
I'm going to get

01:22.308 --> 01:24.610
some great shots of our
little group with this.

01:25.845 --> 01:27.146
<i>Now, kids, you've seen
your Aunt Lily's</i>

01:27.147 --> 01:29.715
<i>photo albums:
leather bound,</i>

01:29.716 --> 01:31.550
<i>acid free paper,</i>

01:31.551 --> 01:33.819
adorable handwritten captions.

01:33.820 --> 01:36.889
<i>And most importantly,
the group shot.</i>

01:36.890 --> 01:38.323
<i>Cute photo, right, kids?</i>

01:38.324 --> 01:39.958
<i>But what you don't see
is what happened</i>

01:39.959 --> 01:42.294
<i>ten seconds
before this picture was taken.</i>

01:42.295 --> 01:44.830
Okay, I want to get
the perfect group shot.

01:44.831 --> 01:46.431
Marshall, sit between
Barney and Robin.

01:46.432 --> 01:48.400
Why?

01:48.401 --> 01:50.169
Oh, you know,
uh, light,

01:50.170 --> 01:52.104
color, balance, aperture...

01:52.105 --> 01:53.572
You're just saying
camera words.

01:53.573 --> 01:55.307
Wait- you don't want
Barney and me

01:55.308 --> 01:57.176
to look like a couple
in this picture,

01:57.177 --> 01:58.577
do you?
Of course I don't!

01:58.578 --> 01:59.811
You two aren't going to last!

01:59.812 --> 02:01.079
I'm going for timeless here.

02:01.080 --> 02:02.814
How dare you?

02:02.815 --> 02:04.082
That is so rude!

02:04.083 --> 02:05.150
It's true.

02:05.151 --> 02:06.318
Totally true-
we're running

02:06.319 --> 02:08.219
on fumes here,
but still rude.

02:09.055 --> 02:11.690
<i>We hated Lily's group shots.</i>

02:12.625 --> 02:15.561
Okay, maybe I get
a little bossy,

02:15.562 --> 02:17.696
but I just want
to remember those times.

02:17.697 --> 02:19.064
Like tonight.

02:19.065 --> 02:21.533
I can't imagine
a better birthday than,

02:21.534 --> 02:24.403
than being here with just
my four best friends.

02:24.404 --> 02:26.471
Yay!

02:26.472 --> 02:28.840
And Ted's here now. Yay!
Oh!

02:31.911 --> 02:33.946
Happy birthday!

02:33.947 --> 02:35.747
This is Amanda.

02:35.748 --> 02:38.717
And Amanda... yay.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:52.865 --> 02:55.601
Ted, you were supposed
to bring a cheesecake,

02:55.602 --> 02:57.269
but instead you
brought two grocery bags

02:57.270 --> 02:58.937
and a woman we've
never seen before.

02:58.938 --> 03:00.906
Hi. I'm Marshall.
Welcome to our home.

03:00.907 --> 03:02.040
Start talking.

03:02.041 --> 03:04.243
Amanda's going to make
Lily a cake.

03:04.244 --> 03:05.310
She's a chef.

03:05.311 --> 03:06.945
We met when I was
at a restaurant

03:06.946 --> 03:09.047
last week and I sent
some soup back.

03:09.048 --> 03:10.816
Lucky, she's got
such pretty hair

03:10.817 --> 03:12.451
I didn't mind eating
a little bit of it.

03:12.452 --> 03:14.353
They call me
"The Shedder" at work.

03:14.354 --> 03:18.290
I'm so glad you're
making my birthday cake!

03:18.291 --> 03:20.058
<i>In honor of Lily's</i>

03:20.059 --> 03:21.627
32nd birthday,
I've got

03:21.628 --> 03:24.663
a lot of great games
planned, starting with...

03:24.664 --> 03:26.798
"Lil-ial Pursuit."

03:27.634 --> 03:29.134
Okay, who's
got number one?

03:29.135 --> 03:30.302
I do.

03:30.303 --> 03:31.536
Of course you do.

03:31.537 --> 03:33.705
Okay, Amanda
goes first.

03:33.706 --> 03:35.440
32 seconds on the clock

03:35.441 --> 03:39.811
to answer as many questions
as possible. And...

03:40.313 --> 03:41.613
Go! Question one:

03:41.614 --> 03:42.881
What is Lily's favorite color?

03:42.882 --> 03:45.784
Well, she's wearing pink,

03:45.785 --> 03:47.519
so I'm going
to say pink.

03:47.520 --> 03:48.520
Okay, that's Robin.

03:48.521 --> 03:50.122
Oh, uh...

03:50.123 --> 03:51.423
Her...

03:51.424 --> 03:53.892
favorite color is...

03:53.893 --> 03:55.793
elbow.

03:56.562 --> 03:59.698
I believe Ted was mouthing
the word "yellow."

04:01.167 --> 04:03.067
Which also
would have been wrong.

04:04.804 --> 04:09.107
This game is called
"Gilding The Lily."

04:09.108 --> 04:10.776
Nice.
Thank you.

04:10.777 --> 04:12.010
Okay, you've all
written down

04:12.011 --> 04:13.979
your favorite things
about the birthday girl.

04:13.980 --> 04:16.648
And Lilypad,
you guess who wrote what.

04:16.649 --> 04:17.683
"Lily makes

04:17.684 --> 04:18.817
"everyone in her life,

04:18.817 --> 04:20.385
from her friends
to her students..."

04:20.386 --> 04:21.620
Lily's a kindergarten teacher-

04:21.620 --> 04:22.988
that's what he means
by "students."

04:22.989 --> 04:23.955
"...feel loved.

04:23.956 --> 04:25.457
"She makes the best

04:25.458 --> 04:26.692
"oatmeal raisin cookies ever,

04:26.693 --> 04:28.627
<i>can recite every line
from Goonies..."</i>

04:28.628 --> 04:31.296
<i>Lily saw Goonies in the theater
right after her parents separated.</i>

04:31.297 --> 04:33.465
For a long time after that, she
had real trouble trusting people...

04:33.466 --> 04:35.667
Ted!

04:35.668 --> 04:37.736
"And she's the strongest person
I've ever met.

04:37.737 --> 04:40.172
"I can't imagine
my life without her.

04:40.173 --> 04:41.740
I love you, Lily."

04:41.741 --> 04:44.142
Aww... Robin!

04:44.143 --> 04:45.744
Of course it was me.

04:45.745 --> 04:47.312
Come on.
Aww, that's so sweet.

04:47.313 --> 04:50.115
Okay, Lily,
you try to guess

04:50.116 --> 04:52.084
who wrote this.

04:57.724 --> 04:59.458
"You seem really nice."

04:59.459 --> 05:01.860
Oh...

05:01.861 --> 05:03.428
I'm going
to guess Amanda?

05:03.429 --> 05:05.329
No, that w me.

05:05.665 --> 05:07.565
And I meant every word.

05:07.834 --> 05:10.669
Well, I should get back
to that cake.

05:10.670 --> 05:12.871
Okay, let me know
if you need anything.

05:16.242 --> 05:17.776
All right, quick!
Let's do the group photo!

05:17.777 --> 05:19.211
Everybody gather
around the fireplace.

05:19.212 --> 05:21.780
Oh, uh, hang on, I'll, uh,
I'll let Amanda know.

05:21.781 --> 05:23.415
Oh, no, that's okay.
She's busy in the kitchen.

05:23.416 --> 05:25.150
Let's not bother her. Come on.

05:25.151 --> 05:26.785
Hey, hang on a second.
You...

05:26.786 --> 05:29.354
You don't want Amanda
in the photo, do you?

05:29.355 --> 05:31.123
No, no, it's just, you know,

05:31.124 --> 05:33.925
auto-focus,
shutter speed, zoom...

05:33.926 --> 05:36.061
Lily, what's going on?

05:36.062 --> 05:37.462
Who wants a party hat?

05:37.463 --> 05:40.098
Hey, look!
Look, I'm a bird!

05:40.099 --> 05:42.000
Let's all be birds.

05:42.001 --> 05:43.301
Lily, tell me the truth.

05:43.302 --> 05:45.170
No, of course not.
I'm not going to let

05:45.171 --> 05:49.374
another one of your dumb skanks
ruin my precious memories.

05:55.793 --> 05:57.427
Lily, what are you
talking about?

05:57.428 --> 05:59.863
Ted, you always do this.

05:59.864 --> 06:01.899
You bring girls
that we barely know

06:01.900 --> 06:03.500
to all our big group events.

06:03.501 --> 06:05.502
I do not.
Oh, really?

06:05.503 --> 06:07.804
Oh, well, let's just
take a little walk

06:07.805 --> 06:10.307
down Random Skank Lane.

06:10.308 --> 06:13.176
Or, or we could just
keep on a-strolling down

06:13.177 --> 06:14.912
Best Birthday Ever Avenue.

06:14.913 --> 06:17.781
Do I get a vote?
Skank Lane! Skank Lane!

06:17.782 --> 06:20.517
Hey, hey, guys. I've composed
a song for the evening.

06:20.518 --> 06:22.719
Follow along.
The chorus goes like this:

06:22.720 --> 06:24.888
♪ Happy, happy Lily day ♪

06:24.889 --> 06:26.189
♪ Happy, happy
Lily day... ♪

06:26.190 --> 06:28.191
Christmas morning,
four years ago.

06:28.192 --> 06:32.996
Our first Christmas together,
just the five of us.

06:32.997 --> 06:35.198
Ooh, Ted, here's another
fun little trivia me.

06:35.199 --> 06:37.901
It's called:
Name That Bitch.

06:40.538 --> 06:44.241
It's, it is Sa... San...

06:44.242 --> 06:46.343
Wrong. You're
thinking of Santa,

06:46.344 --> 06:48.045
'cause it was Christmas.

06:48.046 --> 06:50.247
Fun fact- each year,
my mother has Easter tea

06:50.248 --> 06:52.148
with her friend Bunny.

06:52.750 --> 06:54.650
Okay, not that fun.

06:54.886 --> 06:55.953
I remember her name.

06:55.954 --> 06:57.020
It's Sarah.

06:57.021 --> 06:59.523
Close. It's Leilani.

06:59.524 --> 07:01.592
She just had to come
to Christmas because you said,

07:01.593 --> 07:03.760
"Guys, she might be the one."

07:03.761 --> 07:05.662
And she's
not the only

07:05.663 --> 07:08.065
"might be the one."

07:08.066 --> 07:10.267
New Year's Eve, 2007:

07:10.268 --> 07:12.636
Barney, Lily, Robin,
Ted, Marshall

07:12.637 --> 07:15.038
and "She's the One" Emily.

07:15.039 --> 07:17.207
Robin's Uncle Cecil's funeral:

07:17.208 --> 07:20.243
Marshall, Lily,
Robin, Barney, Ted and...

07:20.244 --> 07:22.346
"this just proves
you find the one

07:22.347 --> 07:24.514
when you're not looking" Isabel.

07:24.515 --> 07:26.316
My appenx surgery:

07:26.317 --> 07:29.252
Robin, Marshall,
Barney, Lily, Ted, and...

07:29.253 --> 07:32.189
Well, this one you admitted
you were just trying to bang.

07:32.190 --> 07:34.391
Respect.
Oh, hey.

07:34.392 --> 07:35.826
Remember this yoga instructor

07:35.827 --> 07:37.361
you brought
to my birthday last year?

07:37.362 --> 07:38.762
♪ You. ♪

07:38.763 --> 07:39.963
Thank you.

07:39.964 --> 07:41.264
Thank you.
Oh, my- oh, my God.

07:41.265 --> 07:42.933
You guys are not going
to believe who just came in.

07:42.934 --> 07:44.835
Don't look.
Don't look!

07:44.836 --> 07:46.169
Why aren't you looking?!

07:46.170 --> 07:48.205
It's Slash
from Guns N' Roses!

07:49.540 --> 07:52.542
Okay, okay, group shot.
Group shot!

07:53.144 --> 07:54.511
And we got it.

07:54.512 --> 07:58.048
We got a picture
with Slash on my birthday.

07:58.049 --> 08:00.117
Awesome, right? Right?

08:00.118 --> 08:01.652
We were there.
We know how this ends.

08:01.653 --> 08:03.553
Wrong!

08:04.489 --> 08:06.189
You know what's funny
about this picture?

08:06.190 --> 08:07.858
He was grabbing my ass.
Really?

08:07.859 --> 08:09.826
He was grabbing my ass, too.
He was grabbing

08:09.827 --> 08:11.928
my ass, too- how many hands
does that guy have?

08:11.929 --> 08:14.064
No wonder he's such
a good guitarist.

08:14.065 --> 08:17.100
Actually, I'm sorry dude,
I thought that you were Lily.

08:18.002 --> 08:19.236
Wait a second.
Look at these pictures again.

08:19.237 --> 08:21.571
Barney has the same pose
in each shot

08:21.572 --> 08:24.174
and these are,
like, years apart.

08:29.147 --> 08:30.480
Ah, yes, about that:

08:30.481 --> 08:32.916
I never take a bad picture.

08:32.917 --> 08:34.518
Never have, never will.

08:34.519 --> 08:37.486
There has to be
a bad picture of you.

08:37.488 --> 08:38.889
Nope, not one.

08:38.890 --> 08:40.090
What about from
elementary school?

08:40.091 --> 08:41.758
Everyone has bad
pictures from school.

08:41.759 --> 08:43.659
Not the Barnacle.

08:45.229 --> 08:46.797
<i>I always look</i>

08:46.798 --> 08:49.266
drop dead, stone cold amazing.

08:49.267 --> 08:52.502
Unlike Marshall, who just looks
dead, stoned and cold.

08:52.503 --> 08:54.137
<i>He was right, kids.</i>

08:54.138 --> 08:56.440
<i>Your Uncle Marshall
does a lot of things well,</i>

08:56.441 --> 08:59.009
<i>but he does not take
a good picture.</i>

09:01.079 --> 09:02.446
<i>They're not</i>

09:02.447 --> 09:04.981
all bad, okay?
Like... here.

09:04.982 --> 09:07.050
Here, look at this one.
My eyes are open.

09:07.051 --> 09:08.385
Marshall, no!
Oh, you did

09:08.386 --> 09:09.820
put a bow on it.

09:09.821 --> 09:10.987
Chip and dip, Barney?

09:10.988 --> 09:13.123
Sure.

09:13.124 --> 09:14.124
Aha!

09:14.125 --> 09:16.860
Got it! A bad picture.

09:16.861 --> 09:18.761
Is it though?

09:21.332 --> 09:22.666
No! Wait!

09:22.667 --> 09:23.900
You were eating a chip!

09:23.901 --> 09:25.736
Where's the chip?

09:25.737 --> 09:29.239
It is physically impossible
for me to take a bad picture.

09:29.240 --> 09:31.475
I don't know why.
Ask God.

09:33.511 --> 09:34.878
Look, Lily,
I'm sorry about Amanda.

09:34.879 --> 09:36.012
I'm just going to say it.

09:36.013 --> 09:37.913
You are being
a birthday brat.

09:39.117 --> 09:40.517
You're all bent out
of shape just 'cause

09:40.518 --> 09:41.885
you think I ruined
a couple pictures.

09:41.886 --> 09:43.053
Oh, Ted.

09:43.054 --> 09:44.621
These girls have ruined

09:44.622 --> 09:49.626
so many events,
or are you forgetting Paris?

09:49.627 --> 09:51.061
What happened in Paris?

09:51.062 --> 09:54.464
It was junior year and I was
studying abroad in Paris,

09:54.465 --> 09:56.199
and I hadn't seen
Marshall for two months.

09:56.200 --> 09:57.701
Two months.

09:57.702 --> 09:59.936
And I had just started
having sex.

09:59.937 --> 10:02.139
I wasn't ready to stop
for two months.

10:02.140 --> 10:05.108
And Marshall was coming
to visit over spring break.

10:05.109 --> 10:08.445
And at the last minute,
Ted decided to come

10:08.446 --> 10:12.849
with the girl he had just
gotten back together with, Karen.

10:12.850 --> 10:14.951
Karen.

10:14.952 --> 10:17.120
I am so excited you're here.

10:17.121 --> 10:19.122
I'm so excited
to go to Paris.

10:19.123 --> 10:21.558
I'm so excited
to have sex again.

10:21.559 --> 10:24.661
<i>But just before the plane
took off...</i>

10:24.662 --> 10:27.397
Wait, I want to tell
you something.

10:27.398 --> 10:30.801
Really? 'Cause I think I want
to tell you the same thing.

10:30.802 --> 10:32.269
Is your thing, I had sex

10:32.270 --> 10:34.237
with my philosophy
professor last night?

10:35.006 --> 10:37.407
'Cause that's my thing.

10:37.408 --> 10:40.210
<i>And thus began the longest
seven and a half hours</i>

10:40.211 --> 10:41.912
<i>of Marshall's life.</i>

10:41.913 --> 10:44.414
♪ ♪

10:52.223 --> 10:54.624
<i>When I picked them up
at the airport...</i>

10:54.625 --> 10:56.393
Ted broke up with me.

10:56.394 --> 10:58.528
I need to sleep
in your room this week.

10:58.529 --> 11:00.429
Marshall can bunk with Ted.

11:06.504 --> 11:07.938
Two months!

11:07.939 --> 11:10.273
<i>My balls were bleu! Bleu!</i>

11:10.274 --> 11:11.708
This will come

11:11.709 --> 11:15.078
as no shock, but the rest
of the trip was terrible.

11:22.920 --> 11:25.055
<i>And all I wanted was</i>

11:25.056 --> 11:26.223
a romantic kiss picture

11:26.224 --> 11:28.425
in front
of the Eiffel Tower, which

11:28.426 --> 11:30.360
I actually did get.

11:30.361 --> 11:33.763
<i>It just happened to be between
Karen and Francois,</i>

11:33.764 --> 11:36.566
our waiter from the day before.

11:36.567 --> 11:37.734
Wow, that's just awful.

11:37.735 --> 11:39.436
Just... Ugh!
Just-Just...

11:39.437 --> 11:40.637
Oopsies! Hey.

11:40.638 --> 11:42.873
I dropped my phone. You mind
picking it up for me?

11:42.874 --> 11:44.641
Oh, sure. Smile,
you son of a bitch!

11:44.642 --> 11:46.076
Got it!

11:46.077 --> 11:48.378
Did you, though?

11:50.882 --> 11:52.482
Wait. How do you do that?!

11:52.483 --> 11:54.117
You weren't even standing up!

11:54.118 --> 11:55.385
The camera loves me, Robin.

11:55.386 --> 11:56.586
More than loves me.

11:56.587 --> 11:57.787
The camera lusts after me.

11:57.788 --> 12:00.257
The camera wants
to put on some nice lingerie,

12:00.258 --> 12:01.625
pop in an Al Green CD,

12:01.626 --> 12:03.593
dim the lights
and do all the work

12:03.594 --> 12:05.896
while I just lie there
with my eyes closed.

12:05.897 --> 12:08.031
Look, I'm sorry
about Paris

12:08.032 --> 12:09.833
and all the ruined
group shots,

12:09.834 --> 12:11.968
but when you're
single, you got to hope

12:11.969 --> 12:14.004
that each next new
girl is the one.

12:14.005 --> 12:15.272
I mean, Erin.
Emily.

12:15.273 --> 12:16.473
Irene.
Or Isabel.

12:16.474 --> 12:18.008
And Sarah.
It's Leilani.

12:18.009 --> 12:19.509
What is wrong with you?

12:19.510 --> 12:20.877
At the time,
yes, I thought

12:20.878 --> 12:22.779
each of these girls
could be the one,

12:22.780 --> 12:24.114
but I got to stay hopeful.

12:24.115 --> 12:25.348
I mean, what's
the alternative?

12:25.349 --> 12:26.549
Here's the alternative.

12:26.550 --> 12:29.319
How about no more random skanks
at my birthday!

12:30.354 --> 12:31.821
Hey, sweetie!

12:31.822 --> 12:34.124
Hi. Uh, do you guys
have a cooling rack?

12:34.125 --> 12:35.458
Oh, drawer under the oven.

12:35.459 --> 12:37.594
Can't wait.
You're just the best!

12:39.096 --> 12:40.230
Ted, I'm sorry.

12:40.231 --> 12:41.898
I gonna have
to agree with Lily on this.

12:41.899 --> 12:43.366
I mean, these kind
of events

12:43.367 --> 12:44.734
are hard for a new person.

12:44.735 --> 12:46.503
That's why
I didn't bring Don tonight.

12:46.504 --> 12:48.438
I mean, when I lived
in Japan,

12:48.439 --> 12:49.940
this guy, for our third date,

12:49.941 --> 12:52.142
brought me
to his brother's wedding.

12:52.143 --> 12:55.245
<i>Now, I- a total stranger-</i>

12:55.246 --> 12:57.514
<i>am in that Japanese couple's
wedding picture</i>

12:57.515 --> 12:59.883
<i>for all eternity.</i>

13:01.652 --> 13:03.687
Uh...

13:03.688 --> 13:06.389
Yeah, Ted, I think you
should listen to Robin.

13:06.390 --> 13:09.259
Right, right, 'cause...
'cause Robin's your best friend.

13:09.260 --> 13:10.493
Mm.
Exactly.

13:10.494 --> 13:11.394
Your best friend
in the whole world.

13:11.395 --> 13:12.529
Absolutely.

13:12.530 --> 13:14.798
Careful, Lily. It's a trap.

13:14.799 --> 13:16.633
And before she was your
best friend, what was she?

13:16.634 --> 13:18.168
Oh, that's right.

13:18.169 --> 13:20.403
One of my random skanks.

13:20.404 --> 13:21.538
Hey!

13:21.539 --> 13:22.739
Okay, yes, Ted.

13:22.740 --> 13:24.341
This particular skank... Hey!

13:24.342 --> 13:25.642
...happened
to work out,

13:25.643 --> 13:27.243
but she's the
skanky exception,

13:27.244 --> 13:28.545
not the skanky rule.

13:28.546 --> 13:30.580
Okay, I'm crying
a little bit. Okay.

13:30.581 --> 13:33.950
Hey, guys, that about wraps up
this whole skank conversation.

13:33.951 --> 13:36.619
Let's get back
to the birthday song!

13:36.620 --> 13:40.690

events ever just be us?

14:12.790 --> 14:16.326
<i>Like the time we celebrated
Marshall passing the bar exam.</i>

14:16.327 --> 14:17.727
Hey.
Hey, guys.

14:17.728 --> 14:20.397
This is the disgusting,
smelly hippie I'm dating.

14:20.398 --> 14:21.698
Hey!

14:21.699 --> 14:23.299
I did not say that!

14:23.300 --> 14:25.168
Well, you might
as well have.

14:25.169 --> 14:27.570
Hey, guys.
This is Strawberry.

14:27.571 --> 14:28.938
Hey!

14:28.939 --> 14:30.540
Um, should we
order more food?

14:30.541 --> 14:32.442
Oh, no. Uh,
Strawberry's not eating.

14:32.443 --> 14:34.844
I'm a vegetarian.

14:34.845 --> 14:37.414
Okay.

14:37.415 --> 14:39.682
Well, let's all raise a glass.

14:39.683 --> 14:40.850
Mm.

14:40.851 --> 14:42.619
For the last three years,

14:42.620 --> 14:44.687
Marshall has been
working so hard,

14:44.688 --> 14:46.456
and I am so proud of you.

14:46.457 --> 14:48.357
Meat is murder!

14:49.260 --> 14:51.160
Murder!

14:52.229 --> 14:53.630
Okay, I admit it.

14:53.631 --> 14:54.864
Strawberry was a mistake.

14:54.865 --> 14:56.332
But how could I have known that
going in?

14:56.333 --> 15:00.003
Her name was Strawberry.

15:00.004 --> 15:01.237
Look, if it's such a big deal,

15:01.238 --> 15:02.872
Amanda doesn't have to be
in the group photo.

15:02.873 --> 15:04.574
But I promise she's not gonna
ruin your birthday.

15:04.575 --> 15:05.775
Just-Just give her a chance.

15:05.776 --> 15:07.043
See, look, guys.

15:07.044 --> 15:08.244
We're all friends again!

16:35.770 --> 16:40.206
You ruin Lily's birthday
and you want me to apologize?

16:40.207 --> 16:42.809
If anything, you should
apologize to me.

16:42.810 --> 16:44.377
What are you talking about?

16:44.378 --> 16:46.946
Ted, you bring girls
to these intimate events

16:46.947 --> 16:49.015
and it makes them think that
things are really serious.

16:49.016 --> 16:50.617
And then when you
break up with them,

16:50.618 --> 16:52.185
you know who they turn to?

16:52.186 --> 16:55.422
Me. I've been your girlfriend
cleanup crew for yea.

16:55.423 --> 16:57.190
<i>February, 2005.</i>

16:57.191 --> 16:59.793

from a marathon study session</i>

16:59.794 --> 17:01.594
<i>at the law library.
Hey.</i>

17:01.595 --> 17:03.763
Hey, Natalie,
where's, uh, where's Ted?

17:03.764 --> 17:07.634
We broke up... again!

17:09.002 --> 17:10.170
Uh-oh.

17:10.171 --> 17:12.739
Won't you sit with me
for a little while?

17:13.574 --> 17:14.874
Just sit?

17:14.875 --> 17:17.609
Man, you know what? I've been up
for, like, 36 hours.

17:20.781 --> 17:22.681
Just for a few minutes.

17:28.756 --> 17:31.858
And at first,
I was completely sympathetic.

17:31.859 --> 17:33.059
But damn it, Ted,

17:33.060 --> 17:35.228
over the years,
you made me cynical.

17:35.229 --> 17:37.430
You know what? I'm going to
go get us some Rocky Road,

17:37.431 --> 17:41.267
and we're just going to sit here
and talk it out until it makes sense.

17:41.268 --> 17:45.038
I just thought we had
something so special, you know?

17:45.039 --> 17:47.607
Me, too. Yeah.

17:47.608 --> 17:51.277
But, you know, life
goes on, sweetheart.

17:51.278 --> 17:54.581
I don't know how I'm going to put
my life back together after this.

17:54.582 --> 17:56.749
Oh, shut up.

17:58.152 --> 18:00.253
Well, I'm sorry my search
for true love has been

18:00.254 --> 18:02.222
such an inconvenience
to you guys.

18:02.223 --> 18:04.624
You know what?
Maybe your precious pictures

18:04.625 --> 18:06.359
would look a lot better
if I wasn't in them.

18:06.360 --> 18:08.995
They'd look a lot better if Marshall
weren't in them. Cheap shot, bro.

18:08.996 --> 18:10.296
Cheap shot.

18:10.297 --> 18:12.165
You know what these
pictures are, Lily?

18:12.166 --> 18:13.633
They're a big, fat lie.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.401
They're posed.
They're touched up.

18:15.402 --> 18:17.504
They're what you want our life
to be, not what it is.

18:17.505 --> 18:19.806
That's not true!
Oh, yeah? Okay.

18:19.807 --> 18:20.907
Look at this one.

18:20.908 --> 18:22.642
Halloween,
two years ago.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.110
You and Marshall
got in a huge fight

18:24.111 --> 18:25.645
because you didn't want
to dress up as penguins.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.380
No, no-no, it's not just
that she didn't want to.

18:27.381 --> 18:30.416
It's that she called
penguins "lame." Penguins.

18:30.417 --> 18:31.851
And yet, here you are,

18:31.852 --> 18:34.721
smiling like nothing's
wrong- completely phony.

18:36.357 --> 18:38.224
Robin's birthday,
three years ago.

18:38.225 --> 18:40.059
Robin had a cold
and you made her

18:40.060 --> 18:41.427
change out of her
pajama's for the picture.

18:41.428 --> 18:42.462
And then you pinched my cheeks

18:42.463 --> 18:44.364
really hard to get
some color in them.

18:44.365 --> 18:46.599
Yeah, but you look pretty.

18:46.600 --> 18:49.736
And then, we all ate
chocolate cake in my bed.

18:49.737 --> 18:52.171
Actually, that was
a really nice night.

18:52.172 --> 18:53.506
Yeah, it was.

18:53.507 --> 18:55.308
Yeah, I guess it was.

18:55.309 --> 18:57.744
Hey, look at this one.

18:57.745 --> 18:59.712
This is the first picture

18:59.713 --> 19:01.381
the three of us
ever took together.

19:01.382 --> 19:02.749
That's right. It was.

19:02.750 --> 19:05.418
Yeah, you remember
how it happened?

19:05.419 --> 19:06.819
Okay, ready?

19:06.820 --> 19:07.987
Wait, wait, wait.

19:07.988 --> 19:09.188
What pose should we do?

19:09.189 --> 19:11.089
Buddy cop picture?

19:11.892 --> 19:14.227
Oh, no, no-no!
What about, um, '80s sitcom

19:14.228 --> 19:16.863
about two roommates who never
agree on anything? Mm-hmm.

19:17.965 --> 19:19.966
Nice. Okay,
one, two...

19:21.135 --> 19:23.236
Hi, Marshall.

19:23.237 --> 19:24.604
Ready for the movie?

19:24.605 --> 19:26.673
Um, yeah. Just a
second though, okay?

19:26.674 --> 19:28.041
We're about to
make history.

19:28.042 --> 19:30.243
We're about to take our
first ever roommate picture.

19:30.244 --> 19:32.745
Yeah. Hey, why don't you
get in the picture, too?

19:32.746 --> 19:33.846
Really?

19:33.847 --> 19:35.248
Yeah.

19:35.249 --> 19:37.083
What are you doing, Ted?
What if we break up?

19:37.084 --> 19:38.984
What if you don't?

19:39.553 --> 19:41.453
Come on.
Come on.

19:45.159 --> 19:47.226
I forgot all about that.

19:47.227 --> 19:49.963
Marshall and I had just
been dating a few weeks

19:49.964 --> 19:53.166
and you invited me
into the picture.

19:54.034 --> 19:55.902
I liked you.

19:55.903 --> 19:57.270
We have to get Amanda back.

19:57.271 --> 19:58.638
Really?
Ted,

19:58.639 --> 19:59.739
you believed in me.

19:59.740 --> 20:01.541
It's my turn
to believe in you.

20:01.542 --> 20:04.010
For all I know,
she's the one.

20:04.011 --> 20:06.212
Thanks, Lil.

20:06.213 --> 20:08.548
I think Lori's age
has made her very wise.

20:08.549 --> 20:12.685
They say your forties are when you
really get to know yourself. Hmm.

20:13.721 --> 20:15.521
<i>So, your Aunt Lily
called Amanda.</i>

20:15.522 --> 20:17.523
All right, people,
gather around.

20:17.524 --> 20:19.392
Let's make a memory.

20:19.393 --> 20:21.361
Okay, Marshall-
Marshall, try this.

20:21.362 --> 20:23.796
Keep your eyes closed
until the last second,

20:23.797 --> 20:25.898
and when I say so,
open them. Okay.

20:25.899 --> 20:28.201
Hey, Barney, is that
a hole in your suit jacket?

20:28.202 --> 20:30.103
What? Where?

20:30.104 --> 20:32.004
Now, Marshall!

20:32.706 --> 20:34.641
<i>Damn it!</i>

20:38.258 --> 20:40.459
Ted, name that bitch.

20:40.460 --> 20:43.296
Birth... a?
Bertha?

20:43.297 --> 20:45.698
No, it was my birthday.

20:45.699 --> 20:48.601
Your brain makes associations
in a very obvious way.

20:48.602 --> 20:50.002
All right, people.

20:50.003 --> 20:52.405
Gather around.
Let's make a memory.

20:53.340 --> 20:55.508
Hey, Robin, what's in
this dip you made?

20:55.509 --> 20:58.544
'Cause it tastes
like... cilantro.

20:58.545 --> 21:02.214
And you know that
cilantro makes me...

21:03.350 --> 21:05.518
<i>Yes!</i>
