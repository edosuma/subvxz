00:07.048 --> 00:09.050
[cheering and applause]

00:18.518 --> 00:23.148
[female announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Bill Burr!

00:30.447 --> 00:33.283
All right, thank you. Thank you very much.

00:33.366 --> 00:34.409
Thank you.

00:36.202 --> 00:38.580
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
How are you?

00:39.914 --> 00:42.167
Excellent. Thank you for coming out.

00:43.376 --> 00:44.753
Very prestigious...

00:45.336 --> 00:49.257
arena to listen
to my dick and shit jokes over the next...

00:50.300 --> 00:52.052
[chuckles] ...90 minutes.

00:52.677 --> 00:54.846
No, I'm excited to be here. I am.

00:54.929 --> 00:56.056
It's very, uh...

00:56.139 --> 00:57.015
[audience whooping]

00:57.098 --> 01:00.769
...exciting to be doing stand-up
outside of my own country.

01:02.103 --> 01:04.063
Yeah. No, not 'cause of you!

01:04.147 --> 01:06.149
[laughter]

01:06.691 --> 01:10.028
It's how it's become.
Fucking US, everything's so goddamn...

01:10.111 --> 01:13.406
Every fucking joke you tell,
"Well, what did you mean about that?

01:14.282 --> 01:18.328
I didn't go to the gym today.
Are you calling me fat?

01:18.411 --> 01:20.497
I feel fucking triggered."

01:20.789 --> 01:22.707
[laughter]

01:23.124 --> 01:25.043
Gotta fucking apologize to everybody.

01:25.126 --> 01:27.337
This is how screwed up
my country is right now.

01:27.420 --> 01:30.298
-You... You know Bryan Cranston, right?
-[audience cheers]

01:30.381 --> 01:34.385
That dude did a movie.
He played a quadriplegic...

01:35.136 --> 01:36.888
and people gave him shit...

01:36.971 --> 01:37.972
[laughter]

01:38.056 --> 01:42.018
...being like, "Why is there
an able-bodied person

01:42.102 --> 01:44.521
playing a quadriplegic?"

01:46.272 --> 01:49.651
It's like, "It's because it's called
acting, you dumb fuck."

01:50.777 --> 01:54.197
See, if he was a quadriplegic
playing a quadriplegic,

01:54.280 --> 01:55.406
that's not acting.

01:56.658 --> 02:00.161
That's just fucking laying there,
saying shit that someone else wrote.

02:00.245 --> 02:01.663
[laughter]

02:01.746 --> 02:05.083
"So tell us, what did you do
to prepare for the role?"

02:05.166 --> 02:08.419
"Well, I dove head-first
into the shallow end of a pool

02:08.502 --> 02:09.711
when I was 23.

02:10.588 --> 02:13.925
I feel like I've been preparing
for this role for my whole life."

02:14.008 --> 02:15.593
[laughter]

02:15.677 --> 02:17.720
"Right, what is up next for you?"

02:17.804 --> 02:20.932
"Oh, well,
they're gonna do a reboot of Top Gun.

02:21.015 --> 02:23.518
Uh, I'm gonna fly... [mumbling]

02:23.601 --> 02:26.521
And, uh,
the copilot's gonna be transgender.

02:27.313 --> 02:29.023
So everybody will be happy.

02:29.107 --> 02:33.820
She won't die. Her discarded dick
will block her head from the canopy.

02:35.196 --> 02:38.366
There'll be a gender-neutral bathroom
on the plane."

02:38.449 --> 02:40.326
[laughter]

02:40.410 --> 02:42.954
How fucking dumb is that?
That's literally like watching a movie,

02:43.037 --> 02:46.749
"Why didn't you have a murderer
play a murderer?

02:46.833 --> 02:50.503
And how come the guy he shot,
I saw him in another movie?"

02:51.671 --> 02:53.548
I mean, what the fuck is going on?

02:53.798 --> 02:56.050
[laughter]

02:58.511 --> 03:00.763
No, I don't know what it is.
I don't know what it is.

03:00.847 --> 03:03.349
I don't know what the fuck is going on...

03:04.058 --> 03:06.269
but I think white women started it.

03:06.352 --> 03:08.354
[laughter]

03:08.438 --> 03:09.772
[cheering and applause]

03:09.856 --> 03:11.733
Oh! It's the worst.

03:13.526 --> 03:16.279
The fucking worst. That's all they do,
is bitch, moan, and complain.

03:16.362 --> 03:19.324
I had no idea how difficult it was

03:19.407 --> 03:22.702
to be a white woman
in the United States of America.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.580
Evidently, it's really difficult.

03:26.998 --> 03:28.583
[chuckles]

03:28.666 --> 03:29.792
[laughter]

03:29.876 --> 03:31.211
Yeah, they're always bitching.

03:31.294 --> 03:34.088
"Do you have any idea
what it's like to be me?"

03:34.172 --> 03:38.051
"Well, I imagine it would be
slightly less awesome than my life."

03:38.134 --> 03:40.136
[laughter]

03:40.220 --> 03:42.096
[laughs]

03:43.139 --> 03:45.225
"What happened to you today,
sweetheart, huh?

03:45.308 --> 03:47.477
Did they not chill your rosÃÂ©?"

03:47.560 --> 03:51.189
You know? "Was the trolley
not running down at the mall?

03:51.272 --> 03:52.482
What happened?"

03:53.483 --> 03:54.359
No, it's unreal.

03:54.442 --> 03:57.362
I'm really fucking annoyed
how white women have the fucking balls

03:57.445 --> 04:00.031
to throw my white privilege in my face.

04:00.114 --> 04:01.157
You know?

04:02.784 --> 04:05.286
Start to separate themselves
from these "white males,

04:05.370 --> 04:06.829
with their white male privilege."

04:06.913 --> 04:09.332
It's like, "Bitch, you're sitting
in the Jacuzzi with me!

04:09.415 --> 04:11.000
The fuck are you talking about?

04:12.961 --> 04:14.963
Yeah! Quit your fucking whining."

04:16.673 --> 04:19.259
Look... here's a little caveat here,

04:19.341 --> 04:22.220
so you don't think I'm a complete asshole
right out of the gate, all right?

04:22.303 --> 04:25.223
If you fucking... If you're living
some Honey Boo Boo lifestyle

04:25.306 --> 04:27.100
on the Appalachian Trail, you know,

04:27.183 --> 04:28.935
and your uncle
just banged you in the dirt,

04:29.018 --> 04:31.062
all right, I can listen to you.

04:34.023 --> 04:38.444
No, one of my fantasies
is I wanna drive by, like,

04:38.528 --> 04:42.865
a woman's rally and just say
the most sexist shit I can think of...

04:43.574 --> 04:45.493
just to watch them lose their minds.

04:46.452 --> 04:48.204
You know,
just drive by real slow and be like,

04:48.288 --> 04:51.708
"Yeah, why don't you get back
in the kitchen where you belong?"

04:52.625 --> 04:53.710
[chuckles]

04:54.794 --> 04:56.587
Just to look in the rearview mirror,

04:56.671 --> 04:59.132
watching them, "ah,"
flipping out in the road.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.926
Spinning around like Leatherface

05:02.010 --> 05:04.387
at the end of Texas Chain Saw Massacre,
like...

05:04.470 --> 05:06.472
"Ah! Ah! Ah!"

05:11.019 --> 05:15.773
Yeah. No, it's a very, uh...
I don't know, times are changing, I guess.

05:15.857 --> 05:16.899
I don't know.

05:17.608 --> 05:20.403
Yeah.
Michelle Obama's doing an arena tour.

05:21.529 --> 05:23.990
That's another thing going on.
I'm gonna say that again.

05:24.073 --> 05:25.366
Michelle Obama...

05:25.450 --> 05:27.243
[laughter]

05:27.327 --> 05:28.619
...is doing an arena tour.

05:28.703 --> 05:32.165
She's not playing comedy clubs.
She's doing arenas.

05:33.916 --> 05:36.794
When did First Ladies
start acting like they got elected?

05:37.962 --> 05:38.838
You know?

05:39.756 --> 05:42.342
Dude, being a First Lady,
that's not a fucking job.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.802
Just standing there, smiling and waving.

05:46.637 --> 05:47.472
Hey?

05:48.222 --> 05:50.683
Look how quiet it is in here.
Why is it so fucking quiet?

05:50.767 --> 05:51.934
You think that's a job?

05:53.770 --> 05:54.937
It's not a fucking job!

05:55.688 --> 05:58.191
Dude, if you really think it's a job,
just look at him.

05:58.274 --> 05:59.359
Right? Look at Obama.

05:59.442 --> 06:03.196
When that guy got elected,
he looked like he was about 41 years old.

06:03.279 --> 06:07.450
When he left office,
that guy looked like he was about 73.

06:07.533 --> 06:08.534
Right?

06:10.078 --> 06:10.953
Look at Michelle.

06:11.037 --> 06:14.791
She looks younger now than she did
when that dude got elected.

06:16.751 --> 06:19.045
What has she done
for the last eight years...

06:19.128 --> 06:20.505
[cheering and applause]

06:20.588 --> 06:24.717
...yeah, other than lay in a giant vat
of Illuminati-level lotion?

06:24.801 --> 06:26.511
Just sitting there, floating.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.766
A couple hours, a shape-shifter comes in
and dumps another bucket on her.

06:31.849 --> 06:33.935
"Here's some more... more of this."

06:35.895 --> 06:39.107
She pops her head up: "Hey, Bam-Bam,
tell Stevie Wonder to come down

06:39.190 --> 06:41.734
and play some songs tonight."
[gurgles]

06:41.818 --> 06:43.861
[laughter]

06:43.945 --> 06:48.074
Yeah. I found out she's doing a tour,
'cause she's doing a book tour.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.284
Yeah, she wrote a book.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.578
She wrote a book about not having a job.

06:53.579 --> 06:55.289
[laughs]

06:56.207 --> 06:58.376
I gotta read that fucking book!

06:59.210 --> 07:02.588
"Chapter One,
how to know if a dick tastes presidential.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.757
[laughter]

07:04.841 --> 07:06.801
How to weed your way...

07:06.884 --> 07:09.345
[whistles and applause]

07:09.429 --> 07:13.808
How to weed your way through
all that local representative cock

07:13.891 --> 07:16.853
and get to the big swinging dick
in the room."

07:18.813 --> 07:20.815
[chuckles]

07:21.732 --> 07:23.401
I'll tell you right now,
say what you want

07:23.484 --> 07:27.113
about Republican Presidents,
but they got their First Ladies in line.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.115
[laughter]

07:29.198 --> 07:30.032
They do!

07:31.367 --> 07:35.788
Dude, George W. was President
for eight years. Eight years!

07:35.872 --> 07:37.748
I don't even know his wife's name!

07:37.832 --> 07:38.875
[laughter]

07:40.293 --> 07:43.713
What was it, Abigail or some shit?
Maggie? No clue!

07:45.381 --> 07:49.260
Donald Trump's wife stands behind him
like a giant meerkat, like...

07:49.343 --> 07:51.095
[laughter]

07:53.514 --> 07:54.807
[chuckles]

07:54.891 --> 07:57.351
Bill Clinton was President,
his wife never shut up.

07:57.435 --> 08:00.021
"Ah! I wanna do healthcare! Ah!"

08:01.731 --> 08:03.149
He fucked around on her so much.

08:03.232 --> 08:05.193
He was like,
"All right, whatever, just do it."

08:05.276 --> 08:06.402
[laughter]

08:06.486 --> 08:07.778
[chuckles]

08:09.405 --> 08:12.867
But I'm telling you right now,
I'm gonna check out that fucking tour.

08:12.950 --> 08:15.119
I gotta see what that's all about.
You know?

08:15.203 --> 08:18.498
Who opens? Who opens on that fucking tour?

08:19.248 --> 08:21.959
Was it Oprah Winfrey's husband? You know?

08:22.043 --> 08:24.045
[laughter]

08:24.879 --> 08:28.382
Does he fucking come out and talk about
what it's like to walk her dogs?

08:29.842 --> 08:31.219
"I do it for 20 minutes a day.

08:31.302 --> 08:33.888
The cocker spaniel's
probably the most fussiest,

08:33.971 --> 08:35.681
and I gotta bring him around."

08:38.934 --> 08:42.270
Look, I'm sure that there's some, uh,
feminists in the crowd right now

08:42.355 --> 08:44.941
not appreciating this joke,
feeling triggered,

08:45.024 --> 08:49.570
feeling like they need to fucking put out
a hashtag or some shit.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.822
And be brave and speak out.

08:55.451 --> 08:57.203
You know what? You're full of shit.

08:57.286 --> 08:59.163
[laughter]

08:59.247 --> 09:00.414
You are.

09:00.498 --> 09:01.999
[cheering and applause]

09:02.083 --> 09:03.084
All...

09:05.086 --> 09:06.629
All those feminists are full of shit.

09:06.712 --> 09:10.132
'Cause I'm gonna tell you right now,
someday... someday, there's gonna be,

09:10.216 --> 09:12.760
there's gonna be
the first woman President. All right?

09:12.843 --> 09:14.387
-Which means...
-[cheering]

09:14.470 --> 09:16.973
You don't even know
what her fucking platform is,

09:17.056 --> 09:18.349
and you automatically cheer.

09:18.432 --> 09:19.475
[laughter]

09:19.559 --> 09:22.728
"Ooh, ooh, it's got the same genitalia!

09:22.812 --> 09:24.230
Ooh!"

09:24.313 --> 09:26.857
Fucking... I'm telling you.
They're not smart people.

09:26.941 --> 09:30.444
Feminists, they're not as smart
as they're coming off, I'm telling you.

09:30.903 --> 09:31.904
Someday...

09:33.447 --> 09:34.824
there's gonna be...

09:35.491 --> 09:39.287
This is going to be my last show ever
by the time this fucking thing comes out.

09:40.871 --> 09:43.958
Someday, there's gonna be
the first female President,

09:44.041 --> 09:48.838
which means there's gonna be
the first male First Lady. Right?

09:49.672 --> 09:52.341
And you wait. You fucking wait!

09:52.425 --> 09:56.220
The first time that dude opens his mouth
about some political shit,

09:56.304 --> 09:57.763
you watch all these feminists.

09:57.847 --> 10:01.142
They're all gonna be, "You shut
the fuck up! You shut the fuck up!

10:01.225 --> 10:06.188
It is her time now. It is her time.
She was elected, not you!

10:06.272 --> 10:08.190
Go pick out some plates, bitch!

10:08.983 --> 10:10.860
You are the First Lady."

10:13.237 --> 10:14.822
[chuckles]

10:14.905 --> 10:18.409
He's gonna get treated like Tom Arnold
when he was with Roseanne.

10:18.492 --> 10:19.744
[laughter]

10:21.579 --> 10:24.957
Secret Service name will be,
like, "Appendix" or "Doesn't Matter."

10:26.334 --> 10:28.878
"'Not Worthy of Protecting'
just entered the Oval Office.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.588
'Not Worthy of Protecting'."

10:34.133 --> 10:35.217
So, anyways...

10:36.010 --> 10:36.844
There's been, uh...

10:36.927 --> 10:39.847
The Me Too movement has happened
since the last time I was here.

10:40.765 --> 10:44.727
Yeah, no, it had to happen, Jesus Christ,
but, you know, I think it's dying down.

10:44.810 --> 10:47.396
You know?
I don't know, I think they got everybody.

10:47.730 --> 10:49.357
[laughter]

10:49.440 --> 10:50.524
Right?

10:50.608 --> 10:52.526
[chuckles]

10:52.610 --> 10:57.323
Just judging by the stories,
I feel like they kind of got everybody.

10:58.032 --> 11:01.619
'Cause the first stories that came out,
they were fucking unbelievable.

11:01.702 --> 11:05.331
It was just guys taking their dicks out
at work, like, "Look at it! Look at it!

11:05.414 --> 11:07.917
Ah! Ah! Ah!"

11:08.000 --> 11:11.045
Fucking blocking doors
and jizzing on plants.

11:12.672 --> 11:16.258
You're fucking at home watching,
"Jesus Christ, people did this shit?"

11:17.885 --> 11:20.930
I remember this one poor woman
said she was a PA,

11:21.013 --> 11:24.100
went into some director's trailer,
and he came...

11:24.183 --> 11:28.688
allegedly, came running out,
masturbating vigorously

11:28.771 --> 11:30.690
while holding a shrimp cocktail.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.024
[laughter]

11:32.108 --> 11:34.110
[chuckles]

11:35.653 --> 11:36.862
I swear to God!

11:38.739 --> 11:40.866
I know that's fucked up,
but I gotta tell you something.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.285
It's a little bit funny
that she felt the need

11:43.369 --> 11:48.499
to use the adjective "vigorously"
after she said he was masturbating.

11:48.582 --> 11:50.292
"He was masturbating vigorously."

11:50.376 --> 11:53.212
I'm thinking in my head,
"Like, as opposed to what?"

11:53.295 --> 11:55.297
[laughter]

11:57.049 --> 12:00.010
As far as I know,
there is only one successful way

12:00.761 --> 12:04.390
to perform that act,
and that would be vigorously.

12:05.558 --> 12:09.854
Is there another way to do it?
Can you do it passively? You know?

12:09.937 --> 12:11.272
Is that how Sting does it?

12:11.355 --> 12:13.858
Is that how he's able to fuck
for hours and hours?

12:14.483 --> 12:17.945
Fans a little air on it.
He puts on "Fields Of Gold."

12:18.028 --> 12:20.448
Just lets that thing rise up.

12:20.531 --> 12:21.365
Just...

12:22.158 --> 12:23.868
Just letting it marinate, right?

12:24.869 --> 12:26.287
[chuckles]

12:27.079 --> 12:28.873
Yeah, so the stories were big
in the beginning.

12:28.956 --> 12:30.958
Like, "Oh, my God,
what a bunch of fucking animals."

12:31.041 --> 12:34.044
And then they just started tapering...
tapering off.

12:34.128 --> 12:37.673
And about, I don't know, six months in,
they just sounded like bad dates.

12:37.757 --> 12:42.344
It was like, "He was... He was
ten minutes late. The chicken was cold.

12:42.428 --> 12:45.389
I think I was raped. Career over!"

12:45.473 --> 12:47.433
[laughter]

12:47.516 --> 12:49.435
"What about my side of the story?"

12:49.518 --> 12:51.020
"Fuck your side of the story!

12:51.103 --> 12:53.814
You have a dick and balls.
We don't wanna hear it!"

12:55.983 --> 12:58.944
Yeah.
It's really weird how the whole thing...

12:59.028 --> 13:02.364
It went from, like, nobody listening...
men not listening to women at all,

13:02.448 --> 13:05.785
to just this total over-correction
that anything they fucking said

13:05.868 --> 13:07.328
means it happens, you know?

13:07.411 --> 13:09.914
They got these hashtags like,
you know, "Believe women."

13:10.539 --> 13:12.500
"Believe women," right?

13:13.709 --> 13:15.336
That's a little open-ended, huh?

13:16.086 --> 13:18.506
Just straight across the fucking board,
all of them?

13:18.589 --> 13:20.424
Every last fucking one of them?

13:21.801 --> 13:23.135
What about the psychos?

13:24.011 --> 13:27.223
What about the ones that key your car
and light your shit on fire

13:27.306 --> 13:29.350
'cause you didn't fucking answer a text?

13:29.433 --> 13:31.602
What about them? Huh?

13:31.685 --> 13:33.646
How about you believe, like, 88%,

13:33.729 --> 13:36.899
and that last 12%
that's out of their fucking minds...

13:36.982 --> 13:39.610
You know, I think that's
a fair percentage, wouldn't you?

13:40.110 --> 13:41.821
No? Are you too afraid?

13:42.988 --> 13:44.365
To not believe?

13:45.157 --> 13:47.409
I know, that's the world
we're fucking living in right now.

13:48.035 --> 13:51.580
No, everything has just become
fucking absolutes.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.083
In... In... In the States,
it's fucking nuts.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.835
Like that Colin Kaepernick guy, right?

13:55.918 --> 13:59.255
You knew when he was, like,
protesting during the national anthem,

13:59.338 --> 14:01.465
no one was gonna listen
to what the fuck he had to say.

14:01.549 --> 14:02.925
No matter how much he explained it.

14:03.008 --> 14:05.135
He goes, "I'm taking a knee
during the national anthem.

14:05.219 --> 14:07.346
This is a protest about police brutality,

14:07.429 --> 14:10.182
the way people of color are treated.
We'd like to open a dialogue."

14:10.266 --> 14:12.142
He got halfway through,
then people were like,

14:12.226 --> 14:15.145
"My brother's fighting in Iraq,
you fucking piece of shit!"

14:15.521 --> 14:17.147
It's just like, "Buddy, buddy...

14:18.023 --> 14:20.651
nobody is saying your brother
isn't in Iraq fighting.

14:20.734 --> 14:23.195
You're not listening.
This is about police brutality--"

14:23.279 --> 14:26.532
"My brother's a firefighter.
He watched 9/11 on television!"

14:26.615 --> 14:31.954
"No, no, no, buddy, nobody's saying
that your brother's not a firefighter."

14:32.037 --> 14:33.330
"I have a bone spur in my heel!

14:33.414 --> 14:35.499
I can still stand up
during the fucking song!"

14:35.583 --> 14:39.211
"Buddy, nobody is saying
you can't see a fucking podiatrist.

14:39.295 --> 14:40.504
All right?

14:40.588 --> 14:41.714
You're not listening."

14:43.382 --> 14:44.550
That's what it became.

14:44.633 --> 14:47.219
It went from not listening to women
to just "believe women", right?

14:47.303 --> 14:48.804
And then people were just like,

14:48.888 --> 14:51.098
"Did you see that story?
Did you read the story?

14:51.181 --> 14:53.392
You can't make something like that up."

14:53.475 --> 14:56.437
I literally wanna be like,
"Well, did you see Star Wars?"

14:56.520 --> 14:57.897
[laughter]

14:57.980 --> 14:59.148
I mean, somebody made that up.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.942
They made, like,
fucking 15 of them, you know?

15:02.026 --> 15:03.777
People can make shit up, right?

15:04.904 --> 15:07.907
"You're part of the fucking problem!
Get the fuck out..." You know?

15:09.950 --> 15:10.868
[chuckles]

15:10.951 --> 15:13.621
"No means no," that's another one.
"No means no."

15:13.704 --> 15:15.080
It's like, no, it doesn't.

15:15.706 --> 15:16.707
All right?

15:16.790 --> 15:18.834
[laughter]

15:18.918 --> 15:22.212
Look, "No!" means no.
"No!" That means no, all right?

15:22.296 --> 15:24.465
[in flirty voice]
But, "No, stop it, what are you doing?

15:25.215 --> 15:32.014
Oh, my God, you're being so bad.
Stop it! No!"

15:32.097 --> 15:33.849
Yeah, that's not a fucking no!

15:34.683 --> 15:38.187
That means, "I wanna do it,
but I'm afraid you're gonna judge me,

15:38.270 --> 15:41.315
so I'm just gonna make it look like
it was your idea so you don't figure out

15:41.398 --> 15:45.361
that I've already performed this act
with 40 other fucking people." Right?

15:45.444 --> 15:46.904
[laughter]

15:46.987 --> 15:50.616
But then... then you go to court
and you get a bad reading.

15:50.699 --> 15:51.659
Some guy's reading it.

15:51.742 --> 15:54.119
[in serious voice]
"Ah, Your Honor, she said, 'No, stop it.

15:54.203 --> 15:56.330
What are you doing? You're being so bad.'"

15:56.413 --> 15:57.873
[laughter]

15:57.957 --> 16:01.168
Yeah! And you're just sitting there like,
"She didn't fucking say it like that!

16:01.251 --> 16:02.962
She didn't say it like that!"

16:07.257 --> 16:08.342
Yeah.

16:08.425 --> 16:11.136
So now everybody's just,
like, scared shitless.

16:12.930 --> 16:16.141
You know? 'Cause I guess if women
ran the world, there'd be no war.

16:16.225 --> 16:19.186
Evidently,
there would be no due process either.

16:19.269 --> 16:21.730
So you've just gotta sit there,
going, "Ah? Ah? Huh?"

16:22.773 --> 16:25.109
[laughs]

16:26.110 --> 16:28.821
No, it's fucking nuts.
People are so scared now.

16:28.904 --> 16:33.784
You now have the male feminist.
Like, where the fuck did that come from?

16:34.785 --> 16:36.412
Just out of nowhere, last couple years.

16:36.495 --> 16:39.623
"I'm a male feminist.
I've always championed women--"

16:39.707 --> 16:42.001
No, you haven't. You haven't!

16:42.084 --> 16:43.961
This shit came out
and you're fucking scared.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.380
You did something.
You grabbed some fucking titties.

16:46.463 --> 16:51.010
What the fuck did you do that you have
to over-correct that fucking hard?

16:51.093 --> 16:54.138
What kind of a man who still has his balls

16:54.221 --> 16:56.682
is walking around saying
that he's a male feminist?

16:56.765 --> 16:58.434
"Oh, I'm a male feminist.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.894
I totally see the way
you see the fucking world."

17:00.978 --> 17:02.980
It's... It's impossible...

17:03.063 --> 17:05.941
as a man who was raised right...

17:06.567 --> 17:08.359
[laughs]

17:08.944 --> 17:10.945
[laughter and applause]

17:12.740 --> 17:14.782
...to be a feminist.

17:15.325 --> 17:16.952
You can't do it. You're a man.

17:17.618 --> 17:20.039
Look, you can agree with it,
you can empathize,

17:20.122 --> 17:21.999
sympathy, you can do all of that shit,

17:22.082 --> 17:25.252
but you can't be it any more than
I can stand there and just be like,

17:25.335 --> 17:28.672
"I'm a Black Panther. Fight the power!"

17:29.590 --> 17:32.009
And then I walk out the door,
a blue-eyed white dude,

17:32.092 --> 17:34.595
and I get to live that fucking life,
right?

17:35.637 --> 17:39.892
I don't know. I don't know, ladies.
I don't buy it. Maybe you do, I don't.

17:39.975 --> 17:42.102
Anytime I hear a guy say,
"I'm a male feminist,"

17:42.186 --> 17:46.148
I always just think, "That is
the most pathetic, limp-dick way ever

17:46.231 --> 17:47.941
to try and get some pussy." Right?

17:48.025 --> 17:49.318
Like, that's literally...

17:50.736 --> 17:55.449
that is literally the fucking game
you had when you were on a first date

17:55.532 --> 17:56.450
when you were 16,

17:56.533 --> 17:58.452
you were all nervous
and your whole game plan was,

17:58.535 --> 18:00.746
"Just agree with her.
Maybe she'll touch it."

18:00.829 --> 18:02.915
[laughter]

18:02.998 --> 18:04.416
[chuckles]

18:04.500 --> 18:08.045
"So, what are your favorite bands?"
"I like whatever you like!

18:08.128 --> 18:11.256
Will you touch it now?
Did I do it right? Uh..."

18:15.219 --> 18:18.514
Yeah, it's a weird time right now.
I'm glad that I'm fucking married now.

18:18.597 --> 18:21.225
I don't gotta fucking deal
with any of that shit. You know?

18:21.308 --> 18:23.018
For younger guys,
how do you deal with it?

18:23.102 --> 18:25.604
You know what was really fucked up
in all of this, though?

18:25.687 --> 18:27.606
What about women who like it rough?

18:28.357 --> 18:29.316
Right?

18:30.609 --> 18:34.113
That doesn't happen here
in the jolly old England? Huh?

18:34.196 --> 18:35.072
[laughter]

18:35.155 --> 18:37.282
Not at all!
Everybody gets all dead silent.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.326
Big fucking elephant in the fucking room.

18:39.409 --> 18:41.995
-Right? Yeah.
-[man] Ask for consent!

18:42.079 --> 18:43.914
How the fuck do you... What's that?

18:43.997 --> 18:46.834
-[man] Ask for consent!
-"Ask for consent"?

18:46.917 --> 18:50.087
Doesn't that take the mood... Well, Jesus,
that kind of took it in a weird way.

18:50.170 --> 18:52.172
[laughter]

18:55.884 --> 18:57.594
[chuckles]

18:57.678 --> 19:00.347
Dude, whatever the fuck I was saying,
however you heard it,

19:00.430 --> 19:02.850
that's not what the fuck I'm saying.
All right?

19:02.933 --> 19:04.935
[laughter]

19:07.271 --> 19:09.439
"You know, I've really listened
to this Me Too movement.

19:09.523 --> 19:12.818
I think for the first time in my life,
I'm gonna ask for consent!

19:13.902 --> 19:16.697
I'm really gonna do it this time.
I've been feeling..."

19:18.448 --> 19:20.617
This is why you can't judge comedians.
Do you understand?

19:20.701 --> 19:22.369
Do you understand
what the fuck I was saying

19:22.452 --> 19:24.580
and how this fucking jackass
just heard it?

19:24.663 --> 19:26.748
You know? The second...

19:26.832 --> 19:28.500
[cheering]

19:28.584 --> 19:29.418
Yeah!

19:30.502 --> 19:34.214
The second it comes out of my mouth,
it's not what I said anymore.

19:34.298 --> 19:35.883
Goes into your fucking ear hole

19:35.966 --> 19:37.801
and gets cut
with your whole fucking childhood.

19:37.885 --> 19:40.554
"Oh, this is what he means!
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da..."

19:40.637 --> 19:42.639
[laughter]

19:45.100 --> 19:48.520
Sir, if I could get along with my point,
if you wouldn't mind that.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.480
[laughter]

19:51.273 --> 19:55.068
No, like, fucking women who like it rough,
like, that's gotta be so fucking weird.

19:55.152 --> 19:58.155
[chuckles] I remember when I was
a single man a long time ago.

19:58.238 --> 19:59.823
A lot of hair ago, right?

19:59.907 --> 20:01.825
Still wasn't a good look,
but I was single.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.161
I was out there, taking some at bats.

20:04.244 --> 20:07.414
I remember that shit. You'd meet a woman,
and when it started going down that road,

20:07.497 --> 20:10.709
like you knew you were gonna hook up,
you'd try to get a jump on it, right?

20:10.792 --> 20:12.836
You'd try to figure out
what they liked in the bedroom

20:12.920 --> 20:14.421
because you wanted to satisfy them.

20:14.504 --> 20:16.673
There's nothing worse
than if you don't satisfy them,

20:16.757 --> 20:18.717
and you know they're gonna
tell all their friends,

20:18.800 --> 20:21.803
and then you gotta fucking move,
and now there's social media

20:21.887 --> 20:24.473
and you got a fucking nickname...
It's a nightmare.

20:26.350 --> 20:29.311
So, you just try to, you know... You try
to do a little fucking intelligence.

20:29.394 --> 20:34.191
You'll be there, hanging out, just being
like, "Yeah, so, uh, what are you into?

20:34.274 --> 20:37.027
What do you, uh...
What do you like to do?" Right?

20:37.569 --> 20:39.696
One night, I asked a woman that,
she set her drink down,

20:39.780 --> 20:42.783
she looked me right in the eye,
she's like, "I like to get fucked."

20:43.700 --> 20:45.494
[chuckles]

20:46.912 --> 20:49.831
And I knew what she meant!
"All right, this is gonna be one of these.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.917
Okay, here we go. Just trying to...

20:52.000 --> 20:53.126
[laughter]

20:53.210 --> 20:54.878
We're gonna have to go hard on this one."

20:55.462 --> 20:58.298
Right? We had a great fucking time.

20:58.382 --> 21:00.550
I don't know how I would...
Today, I would just be like,

21:00.634 --> 21:04.805
"All right, I know what you wanna do,
but, like, you're gonna have to do it.

21:04.888 --> 21:05.847
You understand?

21:05.931 --> 21:09.810
Like, I'm just gonna stand here,
and then you just back into me

21:09.893 --> 21:11.228
however hard you want.

21:11.311 --> 21:14.147
You control how hard
you're backing into me.

21:14.231 --> 21:16.316
Then I'm gonna lay my hand
on your shoulder.

21:16.400 --> 21:21.571
You can put your ponytail in it.
I will slowly close my hand around it.

21:21.655 --> 21:26.159
And if at any point you want to
yank your head like that, that's on you.

21:27.160 --> 21:30.414
My other hand will be just to the right
of your right ass cheek,

21:30.497 --> 21:33.000
and if you wanna do one of those,
that's fine.

21:33.583 --> 21:35.043
But I am not doing anything.

21:35.127 --> 21:38.213
I'm just gonna stand here
like a giant fuck stick,

21:38.297 --> 21:41.008
and you just have at it,
you just have at it."

21:46.013 --> 21:47.222
Yeah.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.891
You know what's hilarious
about sexual assault?

21:49.975 --> 21:51.977
[laughter]

21:52.060 --> 21:53.312
[chuckles]

21:56.315 --> 21:57.816
You know what's hilarious about it?

21:57.899 --> 22:02.070
Is how women are acting like
that is a uniquely female experience.

22:03.530 --> 22:06.825
You know what's funny? I actually,
to the letter of the fucking law,

22:06.908 --> 22:10.537
within the last two and a half years,
got sexually assaulted in this business

22:10.620 --> 22:12.831
by a woman. Yeah!

22:13.415 --> 22:15.334
And this is my story!

22:15.417 --> 22:17.127
[laughter]

22:18.879 --> 22:20.088
[chuckles]

22:20.172 --> 22:24.509
I feel like I can live my truth
and be brave tonight

22:24.593 --> 22:26.470
and share this with you.

22:28.513 --> 22:30.098
It's a 100% true fucking story.

22:30.807 --> 22:33.018
I was doing stand-up,
I was doing a private gig.

22:33.101 --> 22:35.145
All right?
Private gigs are the fucking worst.

22:35.228 --> 22:37.356
You do a public gig,
anybody can show up.

22:37.439 --> 22:39.691
It broadens what you can talk about,
right?

22:39.775 --> 22:42.110
You do a private gig,
it's like everybody grew up

22:42.194 --> 22:44.363
on the same fucking street,
so all your jokes gotta go

22:44.446 --> 22:46.740
right down fucking mainstream
or you're bombing.

22:46.823 --> 22:49.993
So all you do is listen to the first comic
to hear what's working and what isn't.

22:50.077 --> 22:52.037
You're just listening
as he's up there struggling,

22:52.120 --> 22:54.539
going, "Okay, they like bread.
Talk about bread.

22:54.623 --> 22:56.249
Get all the bread you can.

22:56.333 --> 22:59.586
Don't make fun of the troops.
Stay away from the troops!" Right?

23:00.212 --> 23:02.714
So that's what we're doing, right?
And the host gets them going,

23:02.798 --> 23:04.091
then he brings up the first act.

23:04.174 --> 23:05.425
Okay, she goes on stage.

23:05.509 --> 23:07.594
She's not really a comedian,
more of a personality.

23:07.677 --> 23:09.137
She does her bullshit or whatever,

23:09.221 --> 23:11.306
and I'm standing there,
looking at my jokes,

23:11.390 --> 23:12.474
figuring out what I'm doing.

23:12.557 --> 23:15.268
She wraps it up. He goes on stage.
She goes to get off.

23:15.352 --> 23:17.479
I'm thinking, "Okay, I'm next."
I'm looking at my stuff,

23:17.562 --> 23:20.524
and she just walks right by me
and just fucking... poof!

23:20.607 --> 23:24.319
Just flicked me right on the head
of my dick and kept walking!

23:24.403 --> 23:25.737
[laughter]

23:25.821 --> 23:28.532
Like it was nothing.
Just fucking... pow! And just kept...

23:29.533 --> 23:31.159
I couldn't fucking believe it.

23:31.785 --> 23:34.162
I know what you're thinking.
"Oh, was this a friend of yours?

23:34.246 --> 23:36.665
Was she flirting with you?
Was this a joke?"

23:36.748 --> 23:39.000
None of the above.
You know what it was?

23:39.084 --> 23:41.670
I swear to God, it was like a bully vibe.

23:42.462 --> 23:44.423
Like she was trying to get in my head.

23:45.006 --> 23:48.427
"There you go, you little red dick.
Poof! Follow that!"

23:48.510 --> 23:49.928
And she just kept walking.

23:51.638 --> 23:53.640
Dude, my first thought
as I saw her walking away,

23:53.723 --> 23:57.936
I just wanted to punch her in the back
of the head as hard as humanly possible.

23:58.019 --> 24:01.106
Like, literally make her leave her shoes.
You know?

24:01.189 --> 24:02.274
[laughter]

24:02.357 --> 24:03.859
But the other side of my brain's like,

24:03.942 --> 24:06.319
"No, dude, you can't do that.
You can't do that. It's a woman.

24:06.403 --> 24:08.613
And it's just spitball.
Well, fucking boot her in the ass!

24:08.697 --> 24:11.450
Boot her in the ass! Can't hit her, dude.
Can't hit her. It's a woman.

24:11.533 --> 24:14.119
Well, fucking tell somebody!
Tell somebody!"

24:14.703 --> 24:17.122
And all I'm thinking is,
like, "Dude, I'm a guy."

24:17.205 --> 24:20.083
Can't fucking tell anybody.
Nobody gives a shit what happens to a guy.

24:20.625 --> 24:23.295
I'm gonna walk up to another man
and be like, "Excuse me, sir,

24:23.378 --> 24:26.798
but she just flicked me in my pee-pee,
and I didn't like that one bit.

24:26.882 --> 24:29.634
No, sir! I didn't like that at all.
No, I didn't!"

24:31.052 --> 24:33.638
All the guys are gonna be like,
"Dude, if she did that to me,

24:33.722 --> 24:35.474
I would've taken my balls out, too.

24:35.557 --> 24:37.767
Fucking flick both of these.

24:37.851 --> 24:41.313
Fucking sports bar,
up top, Super Bowl, hey!"

24:41.396 --> 24:42.397
Right?

24:42.481 --> 24:44.191
That's all I would've got, right?

24:44.816 --> 24:47.027
So now I'm standing there,
I'm waiting to go on stage,

24:47.110 --> 24:48.487
the dude's doing my intro,

24:48.570 --> 24:50.780
I'm trying to think
about jokes about bread,

24:50.864 --> 24:54.701
and the tip of my dick is still stinging.
This is the world I'm in.

24:55.744 --> 24:58.330
And right as he's gonna bring me on,
all of a sudden, she came out,

24:58.413 --> 25:00.332
'cause she was going back out
to her fucking car,

25:00.415 --> 25:03.752
and that's when my brain started
firing up again with some ideas.

25:03.835 --> 25:06.379
Started thinking shit that I had
never thought before in my life.

25:06.463 --> 25:10.592
Going like, "Dude, there she is.
There she is. Flick her in the box.

25:10.675 --> 25:11.635
[laughter]

25:11.718 --> 25:14.346
Do it, man. Equal rights.
She did it to you, you do it back to her!"

25:14.429 --> 25:16.014
It started making sense.
"Yeah, fuck that!

25:16.097 --> 25:18.767
Flick my dick, I'm gonna flick your clit!
That's right!

25:18.850 --> 25:20.352
I'll fucking hit the man in the boat.

25:21.061 --> 25:23.605
Drop down, uppercut to the bush.
Fuck this shit!

25:24.147 --> 25:26.274
Think I'm the kind of person
you just can flick my dick

25:26.358 --> 25:28.527
and walk away like it ain't shit?"
Right?

25:28.610 --> 25:30.695
And it was making sense
till right when she got there,

25:30.779 --> 25:33.740
finally, I just started thinking
of all the sporting events I had watched,

25:33.823 --> 25:37.244
and I realized that the referee
only sees the retaliation.

25:37.327 --> 25:39.246
He never sees the first aggression,

25:39.329 --> 25:41.289
and then you have
to go to the... yellow card,

25:41.373 --> 25:43.291
whatever the fuck you people
do over here, right?

25:43.375 --> 25:44.918
You go to the penalty box!

25:45.877 --> 25:48.672
So I let her go,
and I went out on stage. I did my shit.

25:48.755 --> 25:52.342
But here was the thing. For the next
three fucking days, I'm driving round LA,

25:52.425 --> 25:54.386
and I'm just losing my fucking mind.
You know?

25:54.469 --> 25:58.390
I'm fucking screaming at the windshield,
saying all this shit that I wanted to say

25:58.473 --> 26:00.850
but didn't say it in the moment. You know?

26:01.434 --> 26:04.604
It wasn't because... This is the thing.
It wasn't because she touched me.

26:04.688 --> 26:07.566
You know what I mean?
I don't give a fuck about that, all right?

26:07.649 --> 26:09.693
You know, when I was a kid,
I had a paper route

26:09.776 --> 26:11.820
and I was an altar boy. You know?

26:11.903 --> 26:13.446
[laughter]

26:13.530 --> 26:16.908
Yeah. You're gonna have
to do a little bit better...

26:17.951 --> 26:20.328
than flick my dick over my jeans
and my underwear.

26:20.412 --> 26:24.124
It's like, "Are we gonna do this or what?
Like, what is happening here?"

26:27.252 --> 26:29.337
It's the fact that she thought
she could bully me.

26:29.421 --> 26:32.090
So after fucking three days of this shit,
I had a splitting headache,

26:32.173 --> 26:35.010
and I started realizing,
"Wait a minute. She's winning this thing."

26:35.093 --> 26:37.679
You know? "Here I am,
still thinking about this shit.

26:37.762 --> 26:42.017
She's probably gone on to flick
30 to 40 dicks since she's been with me.

26:42.100 --> 26:44.311
All right,
she doesn't give a fuck about me."

26:44.811 --> 26:46.563
So, you know what I did?
I drove to my house,

26:46.646 --> 26:48.148
there was nobody home,
I went upstairs,

26:48.231 --> 26:50.233
I closed the door, and I just sat down

26:50.317 --> 26:52.694
and I meditated on it,
and I just forgave her.

26:55.655 --> 26:57.115
-I did.
-[applause]

26:57.198 --> 27:00.285
I just pictured her
as a little five-year-old girl

27:00.368 --> 27:05.665
crying because her alcoholic dad,
you know, wouldn't hug her or something.

27:06.249 --> 27:09.294
And she's just standing there crying,
like, "But, Daddy, I love you!"

27:09.377 --> 27:12.464
He's like, "Get away from me!
I never wanted children!"

27:12.964 --> 27:14.716
And then he walked through a screen door

27:14.799 --> 27:18.219
and he, like, face-planted
into this above-ground pool.

27:18.303 --> 27:22.140
And he had a tool belt on,
and it just sort of pulled him under.

27:22.557 --> 27:25.518
And she ran out, she grabbed his foot,
and she was pulling and pulling,

27:25.602 --> 27:30.106
and his boot came off, and she sat down,
and she just watched him slowly drown.

27:30.315 --> 27:32.275
[laughter]

27:33.652 --> 27:35.153
I don't know what happened after that.

27:35.236 --> 27:38.323
I just felt, like,
this weight lift off of my chest.

27:40.617 --> 27:42.661
[chuckles]

27:42.744 --> 27:44.996
So, there you go.
All you tough guys over here in England,

27:45.080 --> 27:47.540
don't be afraid to meditate, man.
I'm telling you.

27:48.166 --> 27:49.793
You can let a lot of stuff go.

27:52.629 --> 27:53.588
I don't know.

27:56.257 --> 27:57.884
-[man] Whoo! [whistles]
-Do you know...

27:57.967 --> 27:59.803
I'm all right with silence.

28:00.845 --> 28:04.891
You don't have to feel like you have to
do anything fucking extra. Just relax.

28:04.974 --> 28:06.226
If it's funny, fucking laugh.

28:06.309 --> 28:09.729
If it isn't, just fucking sit there,
and I'll know it's time to move on.

28:09.813 --> 28:11.606
[laughter]

28:14.693 --> 28:15.652
Uh...

28:16.403 --> 28:18.446
So, anyways,
I'm a married man with a kid.

28:18.780 --> 28:20.782
Happily married man. Yes, I am.

28:20.865 --> 28:22.951
[cheering]

28:23.034 --> 28:24.661
I... Yeah, I love my wife to death.

28:24.744 --> 28:26.705
I love everything about
being fucking married,

28:26.788 --> 28:29.708
but I'll tell you this right now,
we do fight a lot.

28:29.791 --> 28:31.126
We do argue all the time.

28:31.209 --> 28:34.003
If I've learned anything
in five years of being married,

28:34.087 --> 28:37.507
it is we're always working on me.
You know?

28:37.590 --> 28:38.842
[chuckles]

28:38.925 --> 28:43.388
Evidently, my wife is this completed work
under museum glass

28:43.471 --> 28:47.267
that is to be admired and studied,
like, "Hmm, how did she do that?"

28:48.017 --> 28:49.144
And I'm like one of these...

28:49.227 --> 28:51.980
You know those buildings that
just has scaffolding around it for, like,

28:52.063 --> 28:55.024
six straight years, and you're like,
"Are they ever gonna finish that thing?

28:55.108 --> 28:58.862
Is that some sort of insurance job?
Jesus Christ, what a piece of shit!

28:58.945 --> 29:01.489
They should just tear it down
and start over again."

29:02.407 --> 29:03.241
Yeah.

29:04.242 --> 29:07.328
I have a temper, so that's the thing.
That's what kind of ruins things.

29:07.412 --> 29:10.331
Everything else I do is fine,
but I have a fucking temper

29:10.415 --> 29:11.541
and it just ruins shit,

29:11.624 --> 29:13.334
and then my wife
always says the same thing.

29:13.418 --> 29:15.336
She's always just like,
"I just don't understand.

29:15.420 --> 29:16.880
Where did that come from?

29:17.964 --> 29:19.466
Where is that coming from?

29:19.549 --> 29:23.219
You just go from zero to 100
in two seconds."

29:23.303 --> 29:26.848
It's like, first of all,
I idle at 75 miles an hour, all right?

29:26.931 --> 29:30.602
So don't give me this zero to 100.
I walked into this restaurant 75.

29:30.685 --> 29:33.480
I could hear that guy
talking too loud on his cell phone

29:33.563 --> 29:35.231
from the fucking parking lot!

29:35.315 --> 29:37.025
[laughter]

29:38.902 --> 29:40.653
[chuckles]

29:40.737 --> 29:43.156
Yeah. I fucking tried all of this shit...

29:43.239 --> 29:45.492
Whenever she says that to me,
though, I swear to God.

29:45.575 --> 29:48.495
"I just don't understand.
Where is this coming from?"

29:48.578 --> 29:51.915
It actually hurts my feelings
when she says that. You know?

29:51.998 --> 29:54.542
'Cause it makes me feel like
she's not listening to me.

29:55.502 --> 29:59.214
It's like, "Honey, how many
childhood stories do I have to tell you

29:59.297 --> 30:03.510
before you follow the breadcrumbs
to the absolute lunatic that you married?"

30:03.593 --> 30:04.969
[laughter]

30:05.053 --> 30:09.891
Didn't she ever take a psychology class?
I'm not that complex!

30:10.892 --> 30:14.187
Like, I'll tell you guys a quick...
I'll tell you a quick childhood story.

30:14.270 --> 30:15.897
I'll tell you one of the funnier ones.

30:15.980 --> 30:19.192
One time, when I was, like, six,
my older brother was eight,

30:19.275 --> 30:23.488
we were in the back seat of my dad's car,
and we were, like, laughing and excited

30:23.571 --> 30:25.740
'cause it was around Christmas. Right?

30:25.824 --> 30:30.036
And my dad just had this thing.
He just didn't like joy, you know?

30:30.119 --> 30:31.454
[laughter]

30:31.538 --> 30:35.333
So he's sitting there driving, going like,
"Jesus Christ, knock it off back there!

30:36.084 --> 30:39.003
Christ, you're giggling
like a couple of little schoolgirls!

30:40.088 --> 30:43.925
Christ, you don't straighten up,
I'm gonna buy you a doll for Christmas!"

30:44.008 --> 30:45.218
And then he did.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.136
[chuckles]

30:47.220 --> 30:49.639
I swear to God.
He made us hold them up.

30:49.722 --> 30:52.517
My mother's taking pictures
in front of the Christmas tree.

30:53.059 --> 30:57.522
I'm just standing there, like, "Wah! Wah!"

30:57.605 --> 31:00.191
Afterwards,
I ran upstairs to my top bunk.

31:00.275 --> 31:01.442
My dad knew he'd fucked up.

31:01.526 --> 31:03.987
To his credit, he came up,
he tried to smooth it over.

31:04.070 --> 31:05.822
He's like,
"All right, come on back down.

31:05.905 --> 31:08.992
It's over.
Come on down and enjoy the holiday."

31:09.075 --> 31:10.743
And I'm like,
"No, I don't want any gifts,

31:10.827 --> 31:12.537
I fucking hate you! Ah!" Right?

31:13.872 --> 31:16.958
He eventually coaxed me down, you know?
He just... He softened up a little bit.

31:17.041 --> 31:19.252
"Look, you don't get your fucking ass
back downstairs,

31:19.335 --> 31:21.754
no one else can open their gifts.
Now move it out!

31:21.838 --> 31:23.006
I said move it out!"

31:24.257 --> 31:26.259
I go back downstairs all shell-shocked.

31:26.342 --> 31:29.888
"Here's another gift for you, Billy."
I'm like, "Is this a fucking dollhouse?

31:29.971 --> 31:31.097
When does it end?"

31:33.099 --> 31:36.477
Yeah. That was Christmas,
and those were people that loved me.

31:36.853 --> 31:38.855
[laughter]

31:39.272 --> 31:42.901
"I just don't understand.
Where is this coming from?

31:42.984 --> 31:44.736
I just don't understand."

31:47.280 --> 31:49.908
So, I gotta do it, though.
I gotta work on the temper.

31:49.991 --> 31:51.284
I'm gonna do it.

31:51.367 --> 31:53.453
You know, I got the kid now,
and I just don't want...

31:53.536 --> 31:55.496
I don't wanna pass it on to her, you know?

31:55.580 --> 31:57.874
I have, like, a demon in my family tree.

31:57.957 --> 32:00.460
Like, this fucking rage, it's just...
You know?

32:01.002 --> 32:03.129
Just keeps following us, and now I got it.

32:03.838 --> 32:06.132
I have it so bad,
like, literally, my daughter,

32:06.215 --> 32:10.970
she's a little over two years old,
she's yet to meet me yet. You know?

32:11.930 --> 32:14.515
Like, the real me.
She's seen glimpses of me.

32:14.599 --> 32:17.602
Like, "Hey, how are you?" [chuckles]

32:18.311 --> 32:21.648
She's seen glimpses of the anger,
but I'm able to smooth it over quickly.

32:21.731 --> 32:24.442
Like, "Whoa,
Daddy almost snapped his phone in half!"

32:24.525 --> 32:26.986
[laughter]

32:27.070 --> 32:29.530
But I see it in her face.
I can see the way she looks at me.

32:29.614 --> 32:32.617
She's starting to put it together, like,
"This dude's a little fucked up, man.

32:32.700 --> 32:33.910
He's a little fucked up."

32:34.410 --> 32:37.914
I cannot tell you how heartbreaking
that is to see from a toddler...

32:38.665 --> 32:42.543
much less your own daughter.
I'm like, "I gotta end this thing, man."

32:43.544 --> 32:45.129
This rage, it has to end with me.

32:45.213 --> 32:47.090
I can't have an angry kid
just walking around,

32:47.173 --> 32:51.219
fucking kicking toys, "Fucking bullshit!"
and just being, like, a lunatic.

32:51.302 --> 32:54.055
I want to be like that priest
in The Exorcist when the devil got in him,

32:54.138 --> 32:57.642
and he just fucking leaps
out the window and dies. You know?

32:58.059 --> 33:00.770
So I have been fucking trying everything.
You know?

33:00.853 --> 33:04.065
I tried, you know...
I don't know, I tried...

33:05.441 --> 33:09.612
meditating, wearing sweaters.
I did that for a while.

33:09.696 --> 33:13.741
Like, if I dressed like a regular guy,
I'd be one.

33:13.825 --> 33:17.578
I drew a smiley face on a Post-it
and stuck it on my dashboard,

33:17.662 --> 33:19.914
like that was gonna help
with my road rage.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.083
You know, driving down the street like,
"You mother...

33:22.166 --> 33:27.880
Oh, yeah, I guess I've done that too!
Thank you, smiley face."

33:27.964 --> 33:29.924
[laughter]

33:31.259 --> 33:33.845
I remember one night
I actually considered taking a bath.

33:33.928 --> 33:36.597
'Cause I was gonna call my wife,
I was on the road, and I was like,

33:36.681 --> 33:39.809
"I don't want to have a fight with her.
I need to relax. What the fuck can I do?"

33:39.892 --> 33:41.894
And I thought about it.
Women take baths, right?

33:41.978 --> 33:44.105
They do. It's a very feminine thing.

33:44.188 --> 33:46.691
They have a bad week.
"I just wanna decompress,"

33:46.774 --> 33:49.944
and they just have a soak,
and then they're just fine.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.405
Next thing you know,
they're drinking wine, calling friends.

33:52.488 --> 33:54.449
"I'm so glad you're in my life...

33:55.366 --> 33:58.494
and I feel I can get back
out there again." Right?

33:59.704 --> 34:01.998
So I'm literally alone,
I start drawing a bath,

34:02.081 --> 34:04.042
and the water came all the way up.

34:04.125 --> 34:07.045
And at the end of the day,
I couldn't fucking do it!

34:07.670 --> 34:09.130
[chuckles]

34:09.213 --> 34:12.382
There's just no way as a man
to take a bath

34:12.467 --> 34:15.386
and not think about killing yourself.
You know?

34:16.304 --> 34:19.974
There's just something about
slipping into that coffin-shaped thing.

34:20.058 --> 34:24.062
It's like, "Am I gonna slit my wrists?
Am I testifying against the Mob?

34:24.145 --> 34:25.813
What the fuck am I doing here?"

34:26.438 --> 34:28.775
I'm a man!
I don't take a bath, you take a shower.

34:28.858 --> 34:31.152
Hose it off, block out your feelings,

34:31.235 --> 34:33.612
keep walking till you drop
of a heart attack.

34:34.489 --> 34:37.949
Literally, as you're going down,
"Are you okay?" "I'm fine! I'm fine!"

34:38.034 --> 34:39.702
[laughter]

34:40.203 --> 34:42.705
Can't take a bath.
Sitting there playing with a rubber ducky,

34:42.789 --> 34:44.998
sticking my toe in the faucet. Right?

34:45.500 --> 34:46.417
Not allowed.

34:47.335 --> 34:50.170
Not allowed to be that happy, so...
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

34:50.254 --> 34:53.424
I think I'm gonna go back to therapy.
Do that fucking bullshit again.

34:54.007 --> 34:57.470
Fast-forward through all these stories
I've told a million times.

34:58.304 --> 35:01.891
I gotta do it, though. And I'm gonna do it
for my kid and do it for my wife,

35:01.974 --> 35:04.310
and, selfishly, do it for me...

35:04.393 --> 35:05.728
because...

35:05.812 --> 35:07.355
-[woman] Whoo!
-I'm gonna tell you why.

35:07.438 --> 35:09.732
You're not gonna like the results, miss.

35:09.816 --> 35:11.818
[laughter]

35:14.946 --> 35:17.406
This is why I'm gonna do it.
If I actually don't have a temper,

35:17.490 --> 35:20.326
like, I just think to myself,
"What could my wife complain..."

35:21.160 --> 35:24.497
Like, "What could my wife
bitch at me about?" Right?

35:25.623 --> 35:27.250
I fucking crush everything.

35:28.668 --> 35:30.962
I do. I take out the trash, okay?

35:31.045 --> 35:34.924
The gate was squeaky the other day.
I fucking made sure that was done,

35:35.007 --> 35:36.092
you know?

35:36.175 --> 35:39.303
I pick up after myself.
I like to think I'm a good dad.

35:39.387 --> 35:41.806
I work my ass off.
I make a great fucking living.

35:41.889 --> 35:43.724
Crush all of that.

35:44.809 --> 35:47.478
All she has on me is who I am as a person.

35:47.812 --> 35:49.021
[laughter]

35:49.522 --> 35:50.606
That's it!

35:50.690 --> 35:52.441
[cheering and applause]

35:53.484 --> 35:57.530
Yeah, if I could just not be
who I was when she met me...

35:58.531 --> 36:00.241
I think I'd have a shot, you know?

36:01.075 --> 36:04.704
So, we figured out the number one thing
we fight about is television, you know?

36:04.787 --> 36:07.373
I watch sports.
She watches those Real Housewives.

36:07.456 --> 36:09.500
You know, it just doesn't work out.
You know, I...

36:09.584 --> 36:11.335
You guys have
The Real Housewives out here?

36:11.878 --> 36:13.129
You do? Yeah. Yeah. It's just...

36:13.212 --> 36:16.424
I imagine it's just the most depressing
fucking thing ever, isn't it?

36:16.507 --> 36:18.718
Those women,
they just look so fucking exhausted,

36:18.801 --> 36:19.802
you know what I mean?

36:19.886 --> 36:22.346
Just with the war paint
and the circle tits,

36:22.430 --> 36:25.266
just trying to fucking tuck it in
and fucking...

36:25.349 --> 36:27.310
Like an athlete
at the end of their career,

36:27.393 --> 36:29.979
just trying to limp on to the field
one more time.

36:30.062 --> 36:33.274
They're not as fast as they used to be.
It reminds you of your own mortality.

36:33.357 --> 36:35.693
It's just like,
"Ladies, just fucking sit down.

36:35.776 --> 36:38.237
Put on something flowing.
I'll put on a sport coat.

36:38.321 --> 36:41.657
We'll be in bed by 8:30," right?
"We're fucking old," you know?

36:42.283 --> 36:46.537
So, we realized that, uh, I don't know,
we always fight about the television,

36:46.621 --> 36:48.915
so I'm like, "What about documentaries?

36:48.998 --> 36:50.791
Why don't we just tape something
we both like?"

36:50.875 --> 36:53.753
We both love documentaries.
They're fun, right?

36:53.836 --> 36:57.381
You watch them. You learn something.
You repeat it at a party.

36:57.465 --> 36:58.716
People think you read!

36:58.799 --> 37:00.801
[laughter]

37:02.470 --> 37:05.973
So I tape... You know, first one I tape
is on Elvis Presley. Right?

37:06.057 --> 37:09.227
Now, I love Elvis. Okay? He fascinates me.

37:09.310 --> 37:12.355
He's, like, the first rock star
with the power of television.

37:12.438 --> 37:16.692
They just intersected,
and he ascended to this level of fame

37:16.776 --> 37:18.527
that no one had ever been to before.

37:18.611 --> 37:22.531
Hence, he made all the mistakes 'cause
there was no one there to help him out.

37:22.615 --> 37:25.826
Right? He got a piece-of-shit manager
that stole from him. Bam!

37:26.410 --> 37:28.788
He stopped making music,
started making shitty movies.

37:28.871 --> 37:31.374
He's not a good actor, right? Does that.

37:31.457 --> 37:33.501
Married a minor, started doing drugs,

37:33.584 --> 37:35.962
got fat, got an entourage,
got even fatter,

37:36.045 --> 37:38.714
started wearing onesies,
doing karate kicks,

37:38.798 --> 37:41.467
splitting his fucking pants.
Nobody's saying shit.

37:41.550 --> 37:42.510
"You look good, King!"

37:42.593 --> 37:45.388
"You like that?
You like when my royal balls hang out?"

37:45.471 --> 37:47.807
"We love it, King. Keep fucking going!"

37:47.890 --> 37:52.770
Starts doing pills, gets addicted,
he fucking dies alone on a toilet.

37:53.479 --> 37:56.774
All right? This man kicked open
all of those fucking doors

37:56.857 --> 37:58.651
for the rest of us. All right?

37:59.527 --> 38:00.569
So I sit down,

38:00.653 --> 38:03.406
and I'm watching this documentary
as a white dude.

38:03.990 --> 38:06.826
Which is what I am.
I'm looking out my white head,

38:06.909 --> 38:10.162
watching this white shit,
it's coming back into my white eyes,

38:10.246 --> 38:13.624
getting whiter by the fucking second.
All right?

38:14.375 --> 38:17.586
Now, my wife, on the other hand,
she's black, right?

38:17.670 --> 38:19.714
Now, I hate saying that,
'cause it makes it seem like

38:19.797 --> 38:22.174
I'm gonna start doing
some stupid comparison jokes.

38:22.258 --> 38:24.552
You know, those dumb
white guy, black guy jokes.

38:24.635 --> 38:26.137
It's always like the white guy is like,

38:26.220 --> 38:29.849
"Oh, Jesus, I gotta do my taxes.
Can this chair hold me?"

38:30.558 --> 38:33.436
The black guy is always like, "You need
to loosen up, you gotta relax, man.

38:33.519 --> 38:35.604
You just gotta let it happen." Right?

38:36.522 --> 38:39.567
[chuckles]

38:40.401 --> 38:42.236
It's always the same stupid fucking joke.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.447
I hate those jokes, you know,
'cause they're easy,

38:44.530 --> 38:47.992
and it's been my experience
that it's just not true, you know?

38:48.075 --> 38:51.829
Fifteen years of being with her,
there's really no difference, you know?

38:51.912 --> 38:54.498
Because at the end of the day,
it's a woman.

38:54.915 --> 38:55.916
[laughter]

38:56.000 --> 38:59.337
All right? It's gonna be the same fights.

38:59.420 --> 39:01.630
I don't give a fuck who you're with.

39:02.131 --> 39:04.675
I'm not gonna lie to you,
there might be more head movement

39:04.759 --> 39:07.762
and hand gestures
with different races of women...

39:08.846 --> 39:11.640
possibly an index finger
jabbing at your forehead,

39:11.724 --> 39:13.142
whatever the fuck that is.

39:13.601 --> 39:15.436
But at the end of the day,
it's the same fights.

39:15.519 --> 39:17.563
"What's going on with us?
Do you need to work on this?

39:17.646 --> 39:19.690
Why don't we communicate better?"
Right?

39:20.358 --> 39:22.735
So she starts watching this shit
as a black person, right?

39:23.444 --> 39:26.238
And she's seeing all the racism,
obviously, that I'm seeing,

39:26.322 --> 39:29.992
but she was catching all this subtle shit
that I was too white to see

39:30.076 --> 39:33.746
but I knew I was missing it 'cause I just
kept hearing her huffing and puffing.

39:33.829 --> 39:36.540
Just sitting next to me, being like...
[huffing]

39:38.584 --> 39:41.629
And I'm just sitting there like,
"Okay, somebody did something!

39:41.712 --> 39:43.089
[laughter]

39:43.172 --> 39:46.550
I don't know what just happened,
but I don't think that was good!"

39:48.761 --> 39:51.806
So right when I didn't think
it could get any worse,

39:51.889 --> 39:54.266
it couldn't get any more uncomfortable
between the two of us,

39:54.350 --> 39:58.104
this fucking white dude comes on who,
evidently, discovered Elvis.

39:58.187 --> 40:00.815
And he's, like,
a hundred and fucking 90 years old.

40:00.898 --> 40:02.942
And he comes out, starts talking.
He's just like,

40:03.025 --> 40:06.654
"Well, basically,
I was looking for a white boy

40:06.737 --> 40:10.491
that could take the down-and-dirty,
nasty blues and combine it

40:10.574 --> 40:13.869
with the pristine,
angelic sounds of bluegrass."

40:14.745 --> 40:17.790
Yeah, that's what he was doing.
He was subtly putting black shit down here

40:17.873 --> 40:19.875
while he was propping up the white shit.
You know?

40:19.959 --> 40:23.045
"The down-and-dirty,
daddy-not-sticking-around,

40:23.129 --> 40:25.339
drug-infested neighborhood blues,

40:25.423 --> 40:30.886
with the Jesus-as-white-as-me,
hair-the-color-of-the-sun, angelic,

40:30.970 --> 40:32.930
bluegrass-playing music," right?

40:33.973 --> 40:37.059
So, at this point, my wife has, like,
fucking steam coming out of her ears,

40:37.143 --> 40:38.436
so I make a judgment call.

40:38.519 --> 40:41.147
I just fucking shut it off. Right?

40:41.230 --> 40:43.732
And she looks at me. She's like,
"Why did you shut that off?

40:43.816 --> 40:44.817
Why did you shut it off?"

40:44.900 --> 40:47.611
I was like, "Because you're about
three minutes away from yelling at me

40:47.695 --> 40:49.071
like I produced this music.

40:49.155 --> 40:51.157
[laughter]

40:52.116 --> 40:55.661
All right? Let's just forget it.
We'll watch something else."

40:55.744 --> 40:58.581
She's like, "No, why can't we
just watch the rest of this

40:58.664 --> 41:00.249
and then discuss it afterwards?"

41:01.333 --> 41:03.461
It's like,
"I don't want to fucking do that.

41:04.628 --> 41:07.673
I just wanna watch a documentary!
I don't want to have a fucking lecture...

41:08.215 --> 41:10.426
because of these fucking assholes.
I didn't do anything!

41:10.509 --> 41:12.261
I'm just sitting here watching TV!

41:14.513 --> 41:16.765
Not to mention,
we're just gonna get into an argument."

41:16.849 --> 41:18.684
She's like,
"Why would we get into an argument?"

41:18.767 --> 41:21.437
I'm like, "Ugh. All right, you know what?
Because not for nothing,

41:21.520 --> 41:24.773
there was some black people in there
saying some shit that I didn't agree with.

41:24.857 --> 41:26.233
I'm not huffing and puffing."

41:27.401 --> 41:29.278
Yeah... I said that.

41:29.778 --> 41:31.113
[laughter]

41:31.197 --> 41:32.823
Like a fucking idiot!

41:34.241 --> 41:36.911
And she just looks at me. She's like,
"Like what black people?

41:37.620 --> 41:39.413
Like what black people that said what?"

41:41.081 --> 41:43.959
And at that point,
it's like you started the luge, right?

41:44.043 --> 41:45.920
You can't get off the fucking sled.

41:46.962 --> 41:49.423
Now you gotta have the argument.
Like, "Oh, fuck, here we go,

41:49.507 --> 41:51.759
guess we're having this."
And I'm like, "All right.

41:51.842 --> 41:54.136
All right,
the black guy brought up leg shaking,

41:54.220 --> 41:56.847
saying, 'Elvis took leg shaking from us.'

41:56.931 --> 41:59.016
It's like, really? Leg shaking?

41:59.099 --> 42:01.602
Nobody thought to fucking do this?

42:02.520 --> 42:04.813
Black people came up with that?
You're telling me that?

42:04.897 --> 42:07.441
I'll even give you that!
Let's say you came up with that,

42:07.525 --> 42:09.568
but where did that black dude
learn how to do it?

42:09.652 --> 42:11.403
Didn't he watch
some older black guy do it?

42:11.487 --> 42:13.989
But what? 'Cause he's the same color,
he's not stealing.

42:14.073 --> 42:15.491
He's just carrying on the tradition.

42:15.574 --> 42:18.827
But if Elvis does it, 'Oh, what the fuck?'
Now he's the biggest thief ever?

42:18.911 --> 42:20.412
That doesn't make any sense to me."

42:20.496 --> 42:23.874
She goes, "No, you idiot,
it's not about the leg shaking, okay?

42:23.958 --> 42:26.835
He appropriated a culture.
He took all the music,

42:26.919 --> 42:29.964
he got all the money, got all the fame,
he's called the King of it now,

42:30.047 --> 42:32.466
and he never gave a shit,
not even a shout-out."

42:33.259 --> 42:34.885
And I was like, "All right.

42:35.553 --> 42:37.388
[laughter]

42:38.514 --> 42:39.348
Fair enough.

42:40.266 --> 42:43.477
Made about seven or eight
good points there that I can't refute.

42:43.561 --> 42:45.396
[laughter]

42:46.188 --> 42:48.649
He appropriated a culture.
I get it. You're right."

42:48.732 --> 42:50.109
She goes, "Fine, thank you."

42:50.734 --> 42:52.027
And I go, "However...

42:52.278 --> 42:54.280
[laughter]

42:54.780 --> 42:57.658
Not for nothing, do I get mad at you
when you get on a skateboard

42:57.741 --> 42:59.868
and you start going down
the fucking street?

43:00.578 --> 43:03.497
Do I get all offended, like,
'Hey, man, that's some white shit!

43:03.581 --> 43:05.958
Stop appropriating my culture, man.

43:06.041 --> 43:09.461
Some dirty white kid in Santa Monica
came up with that, man.'"

43:10.254 --> 43:13.382
So she starts laughing,
and I should've stopped there,

43:13.465 --> 43:15.175
but I'm a comedian, right?

43:16.135 --> 43:18.929
I'm like, "Ooh, I'm getting a laugh.
There's gotta be a bigger laugh,

43:19.013 --> 43:20.180
so keep going, Bill.

43:20.764 --> 43:22.766
Let's come with another example."

43:22.850 --> 43:25.644
So I'm like, "Yeah, do I get mad at you
when you fly from LA to New York

43:25.728 --> 43:27.021
in under six hours?"

43:27.813 --> 43:30.357
And she just, yeah... [chuckles] Yeah.

43:31.650 --> 43:34.486
And she just stares at me.
She's just like, "That was fucked up."

43:34.570 --> 43:36.447
[laughter]

43:37.323 --> 43:39.450
I was like, "Yeah. Yeah, I know.

43:39.533 --> 43:42.494
It sounded good in my fucking head
and then it came out. I just...

43:42.578 --> 43:44.997
I was just going for the laugh."
And then she wouldn't let up.

43:45.080 --> 43:47.166
She's like, "Why is it fucked up?
Why is it fucked up?"

43:47.249 --> 43:50.669
So now I'm back in the classroom,
and I'm like, "Because...

43:52.212 --> 43:53.422
if, historically speaking,

43:53.505 --> 43:57.092
black people enjoyed the same amount
of freedom and privilege,

43:57.176 --> 44:00.095
they would have had the money and the time
to figure out how to fly, too."

44:00.179 --> 44:02.681
And she goes, "That's right."
And I go, "However...

44:02.973 --> 44:04.850
[laughter]

44:06.018 --> 44:07.811
...your music would've suffered."

44:08.270 --> 44:10.773
[laughter and applause]

44:11.565 --> 44:12.399
Yeah!

44:13.942 --> 44:16.320
"You can't have my level
of freedom and privilege

44:16.403 --> 44:20.032
walking around with that cul-de-sac,
'It really is gonna be okay!'

44:20.115 --> 44:23.410
and come up with that painful,
beautiful music. You can't do that.

44:23.494 --> 44:26.038
Next thing you know,
you're clapping on the fucking downbeat,

44:26.121 --> 44:29.416
you're playing a washboard, right?
James Brown is line dancing.

44:29.500 --> 44:32.753
All goes out the window,
so you gotta make a choice!

44:34.713 --> 44:37.549
Either you learn how to fly
and your music sucks..."

44:37.800 --> 44:39.343
[laughter]

44:39.843 --> 44:40.928
[chuckles]

44:41.011 --> 44:43.639
Oh, I just noticed this thing came off.
We can't have this.

44:43.722 --> 44:47.059
There's gotta be continuity
between the fucking shows here.

44:47.142 --> 44:48.268
Oh, Jesus Christ!

44:49.103 --> 44:50.562
This thing never comes off.

44:50.646 --> 44:52.815
It's right when you tape
a fucking special,

44:52.898 --> 44:54.525
then everything just falls apart.

44:54.608 --> 44:58.153
Royal Albert Hall, huh?
Where did you buy this mic stand, huh?

44:58.237 --> 45:00.197
Where the fuck did you get this?

45:00.280 --> 45:02.282
[cheering and applause]

45:03.242 --> 45:06.245
You know the mic stand guy's
all fucking pissed off.

45:06.328 --> 45:09.289
"Right, that's a jolly good
fucking mic stand. Fucking Yank!

45:10.833 --> 45:13.752
Fucking Yank...
Everything fucking falls off on him.

45:13.836 --> 45:15.295
[laughter]

45:16.296 --> 45:19.550
How dare you! The Queen comes down here
and sits in a box

45:19.633 --> 45:21.176
and watches the show!"

45:25.264 --> 45:26.765
You know what I heard about you guys?

45:27.141 --> 45:29.101
[laughter]

45:30.477 --> 45:32.521
Actually, by the way,
I've been over here for a week,

45:32.604 --> 45:34.356
and as an American,
I gotta say something.

45:34.440 --> 45:36.191
You guys are pretty fat, too.

45:36.275 --> 45:37.401
[laughter]

45:37.484 --> 45:38.736
[chuckles]

45:38.819 --> 45:40.821
[cheering and applause]

45:41.572 --> 45:42.406
Yeah.

45:44.324 --> 45:47.453
Specifically the men.
I don't know what's going on with the men,

45:47.536 --> 45:49.246
but I don't give a fuck how fat you get,

45:49.329 --> 45:52.291
you're gonna pour yourself
into your skinny jeans.

45:52.374 --> 45:55.419
They still got them. It's like you're
squeezing all the fat to the top

45:55.502 --> 45:56.879
like toothpaste.

45:56.962 --> 46:00.549
"Right, still wearing me same jeans
from primary school!"

46:00.632 --> 46:02.634
[laughter]

46:02.718 --> 46:03.802
[chuckles]

46:05.763 --> 46:06.597
Um...

46:07.848 --> 46:10.642
I don't know, but anyways...
You know what I'm afraid of?

46:10.726 --> 46:11.810
Robots.

46:13.020 --> 46:16.356
Yeah. I saw one get interviewed
on 60 Minutes.

46:16.440 --> 46:20.277
The top journalistic program
in the United States.

46:20.360 --> 46:22.988
And he's just sitting there
getting interviewed, not nervous at all,

46:23.071 --> 46:26.116
just rattling off
all the fucking answers. You know?

46:26.658 --> 46:29.286
Not smoking, not fucking,
you know, leaking oil,

46:29.369 --> 46:32.080
whatever you would do
as a nervous robot, right?

46:32.790 --> 46:35.417
And the reporter's asking him questions,
and in the end, he goes,

46:35.501 --> 46:38.837
"So, tell us..." He's like, uh...
He's like, "What are your goals?"

46:39.713 --> 46:43.634
And I am alone in a hotel room,
and I literally lean towards the TV.

46:43.717 --> 46:46.094
I'm like,
"Do these fucking things have goals?"

46:46.178 --> 46:47.930
[laughter]

46:50.849 --> 46:53.894
And the fucking robot just answers.
He just goes... uh...

46:53.977 --> 46:55.979
He goes, "What are your goals?"
And the robot goes,

46:56.063 --> 46:58.148
"To become smarter than human beings."

46:59.107 --> 47:01.568
Yeah! And the reporter just blows by it.

47:01.652 --> 47:04.112
He's like,
"Okay, and what's your favorite color?"

47:04.196 --> 47:05.405
[laughter]

47:05.489 --> 47:07.950
Meanwhile, I'm standing on my bed,
yelling at the TV, like,

47:08.033 --> 47:11.912
"Dude, unplug that fucking thing!
Take the batteries out!

47:11.995 --> 47:14.915
Pull the wire...
Pull the wires out! Do something!

47:14.998 --> 47:19.878
How many sci-fi movies do you have to see
before you realize where this is going?"

47:22.172 --> 47:25.467
So, anyways, every smart person,
every super-smart person in the world

47:25.551 --> 47:27.469
is saying these fucking things
are gonna kill us.

47:27.553 --> 47:29.972
Even your boy here, he recently died.
What was his name?

47:30.055 --> 47:31.849
-He was always sitting down.
-[man] Hawking!

47:31.932 --> 47:33.934
[laughter]

47:34.017 --> 47:36.353
Hawking, Stephen Hawking, yeah!

47:36.436 --> 47:39.523
Too good to fucking stand up
and make his point,

47:39.606 --> 47:42.067
just sitting down, all fucking smarmy.

47:44.027 --> 47:44.945
[chuckles]

47:45.028 --> 47:48.907
"Oh, I care so much,
I poured ice on myself!

47:49.825 --> 47:50.784
Um...

47:51.493 --> 47:55.080
And I showed off my abs
at the same time for the Gram!"

47:57.499 --> 48:00.627
No, I'm just fucking with you. I am
so glad that guy's fucking dead, though.

48:00.711 --> 48:01.545
You know?

48:01.628 --> 48:02.963
[laughter]

48:03.046 --> 48:06.091
Look at you guys. How much longer
did you want him to suffer?

48:06.884 --> 48:09.261
You don't believe in an afterlife?
Maybe he's up there now,

48:09.344 --> 48:12.514
his fucking legs work,
he's getting an angelic blow job.

48:12.598 --> 48:15.100
How much longer did you want him
to fucking sit there

48:15.183 --> 48:16.768
so you could feel better about yourself?

48:16.852 --> 48:20.939
"Well, at least I'm not all fucking
twisted up, saying smart shit," right?

48:23.191 --> 48:24.902
I couldn't fucking stand that guy.

48:28.030 --> 48:31.533
He was so fucking negative!
He never had anything positive to say.

48:31.617 --> 48:33.368
"Hey, Steve,
what have you got for us today?"

48:33.452 --> 48:38.624
"In 2035, there will be no more apples."
"Thank you, Steve! Thanks a lot.

48:39.291 --> 48:44.087
Wasn't thinking about that, now I am.
Hey, so what's the solution?"

48:44.171 --> 48:46.882
"It's too late.
We needed to try 40 years ago."

48:46.965 --> 48:50.469
"Thanks a lot, buddy.
I'm gonna go cry with my child now."

48:51.345 --> 48:53.722
Dude, I could hang out with that guy
for about three minutes

48:53.805 --> 48:57.392
before I took the brake off his chair
and just zoomed him into the other room.

48:57.476 --> 48:58.977
[laughter]

48:59.061 --> 49:02.606
"Hey, Steve, come back here when you got
something dumb and positive to say."

49:04.191 --> 49:07.694
Yeah. Well, listen, I agreed with
all of these super-smart people

49:07.778 --> 49:11.114
thinking that these fucking robots
were gonna kill us. Right?

49:11.198 --> 49:14.785
I agreed with all of that shit until,
a couple of years ago, I was in New York,

49:14.868 --> 49:16.787
and I was looking through a newspaper,
right?

49:16.870 --> 49:18.830
And I have a whole new fucking theory.

49:18.914 --> 49:22.459
But in order for me to tell you my theory,
I have to quickly take you back

49:22.542 --> 49:26.129
to the deep, dark, sordid history
of the blow-up doll.

49:27.047 --> 49:30.092
All right? I know there's
a lot of millennials here, young people.

49:30.175 --> 49:33.261
You probably don't even know
what one of these is, all right?

49:33.345 --> 49:35.305
With your fucking...
I don't know what you guys do,

49:35.389 --> 49:38.809
your virtual reality glasses,
you know, fucking free porn flying by.

49:38.892 --> 49:42.729
You're grabbing titties, whatever.
Whatever it is you do.

49:42.813 --> 49:43.897
Right?

49:43.981 --> 49:45.983
[laughter]

49:46.441 --> 49:48.235
Back in the day, this was the deal.

49:48.318 --> 49:51.113
If you were a person
and you wanted to have sex

49:51.196 --> 49:56.284
with somebody else, but, like,
nobody else wanted to have sex with you...

49:57.160 --> 50:00.706
and, you know, you weren't strong enough
to hold anybody down, I mean...

50:00.789 --> 50:02.332
[laughter]

50:04.918 --> 50:07.129
You had to go... You had to...
That's how it was!

50:07.212 --> 50:09.923
You had to go out,
and you had to get a blow-up doll.

50:10.007 --> 50:13.885
And you had to fucking go out and get it.
You had to fucking go out and get it.

50:13.969 --> 50:17.055
All right? You couldn't just order it
off of an Amazon

50:17.139 --> 50:18.974
and some delivery guy shows up.

50:19.057 --> 50:22.060
He doesn't know what's in the box.
You're standing there like Tom Hanks,

50:22.144 --> 50:24.980
"Hey, how you doing? Great to see you!"
[chuckles]

50:25.063 --> 50:27.983
"I'm gonna fuck that,
and you have no idea what it is!"

50:28.066 --> 50:29.151
[laughter]

50:29.234 --> 50:35.073
No. Dude, you had to go down,
and you had to fucking get this thing.

50:35.699 --> 50:37.784
You had to find a porno store.
You had to work it out

50:37.868 --> 50:39.745
that it was far enough away
from your house

50:39.828 --> 50:41.955
that no one's gonna recognize your car.

50:42.039 --> 50:43.999
You drive down at,
like, 11 in the morning.

50:44.082 --> 50:46.043
Who the fuck
is gonna be there then, right?

50:46.126 --> 50:49.629
You park in the back on, like,
a Tuesday, just sitting there in the car,

50:49.713 --> 50:51.757
psyching yourself up. [exhaling]

50:51.840 --> 50:53.759
"Okay, I'm not hurting anybody.

50:53.842 --> 50:56.219
It's just an urge.
Just get in there, okay?

50:56.303 --> 50:58.472
Hand him the money,
just get in there and get it done!"

50:58.555 --> 51:01.266
You yank your hat down.
You fucking walk in with all your courage.

51:02.225 --> 51:04.770
Then you get in there, there'd be
too many other perverts in there,

51:04.853 --> 51:05.937
and you get all psyched out.

51:06.021 --> 51:06.855
So what you do is

51:06.938 --> 51:09.733
you just grab a bunch of videotapes,
and you walked up to the counter.

51:09.816 --> 51:13.070
And you had to make it look like
it was an impulse buy, right?

51:13.153 --> 51:16.364
And you're walking up,
and everything, all the creepy shit,

51:16.448 --> 51:18.075
was behind the counter, right?

51:18.950 --> 51:23.371
Just fucking heads and feet,
just an ass, body parts.

51:23.455 --> 51:27.542
Serial killer buffet.
"What fucking world am I entering?

51:27.626 --> 51:30.504
Oh, my God, somebody's fucking a neck?
Jesus Christ!" Right?

51:30.587 --> 51:31.922
And you set it down.

51:34.424 --> 51:37.135
Just make it look real subtle.
"Okay, buddy, is that gonna be all?"

51:37.219 --> 51:41.348
"Uh, yeah, no,
maybe that thing down the end

51:41.431 --> 51:43.308
with the surprised look on its face.

51:44.434 --> 51:47.312
Maybe I'd like to take a shot at that.
I don't know."

51:48.105 --> 51:50.565
The guy wraps it up, you finally get it.
You give him the money.

51:50.649 --> 51:53.151
You fucking run out to the car.
You have this whole weird emotion.

51:53.235 --> 51:54.945
You're, like, excited
and you hate yourself.

51:55.028 --> 51:57.531
"Thank God, I finally did it!
What the fuck is wrong with me?"

51:57.614 --> 51:58.824
And just drive off.

52:00.033 --> 52:02.327
You go back to your little
shitty fucking apartment,

52:02.410 --> 52:05.413
and you had to blow it up quietly
so none of your neighbors heard.

52:05.497 --> 52:06.414
Just like...

52:06.998 --> 52:07.999
[blowing]

52:09.668 --> 52:11.837
Then you got excited,
started going a little faster.

52:13.588 --> 52:16.591
And just watching this thing
slowly coming to life, just like...

52:17.175 --> 52:19.136
[laughter]

52:21.388 --> 52:23.390
[applause]

52:25.851 --> 52:28.687
Right? And then you'd wrap
those rubber legs around you.

52:28.770 --> 52:31.314
[screams]

52:31.398 --> 52:33.400
And God forbid you got caught.

52:33.942 --> 52:36.987
Your roommate comes walking in,
"He's fucking a blow-up doll!"

52:37.946 --> 52:40.365
Dude, your life was over!

52:40.448 --> 52:42.951
You had, like, six minutes
to get your mom on the phone.

52:43.034 --> 52:45.120
"Mom, I love you,
and you're never gonna see me again!

52:45.203 --> 52:48.165
Don't believe what people said about me!
I'm so sorry! I'm going to Alaska!

52:48.248 --> 52:49.541
Oh, God, God!" Click.

52:49.624 --> 52:53.545
That was it. You moved to Alaska.
No one ever saw you again.

52:54.087 --> 52:56.298
And that's why, to this day,
if you go to Alaska,

52:56.381 --> 52:58.800
there's, like, eight men
for every two women.

53:00.051 --> 53:04.014
Yeah, 'cause that state is littered
with men who got caught fucking shit

53:04.097 --> 53:05.765
they shouldn't have been fucking.

53:05.849 --> 53:07.350
[laughter]

53:07.434 --> 53:12.814
So, now, fast-forward to about 2016,
I'm in New York City, right?

53:12.898 --> 53:15.901
And I'm looking through the newspaper,
whatever, and I come across an article,

53:15.984 --> 53:19.696
and it's on this robot that, for $10,000,
you buy this thing,

53:19.779 --> 53:21.865
you can have sex with it. Right?

53:22.407 --> 53:25.368
Now, notice, five minutes ago,
I brought up a blow-up doll.

53:26.244 --> 53:28.163
Didn't even have a joke,
just said "blow-up doll"

53:28.246 --> 53:29.581
and you all laughed. Ha ha ha ha.

53:29.664 --> 53:31.958
A blow-up doll.
"Who would do such a stupid thing?"

53:32.042 --> 53:33.376
Right? "That's weird."

53:33.460 --> 53:37.631
Five minutes later, I say,
"A robot that you can have sex with,"

53:37.714 --> 53:39.132
dead silence in here.

53:39.216 --> 53:41.009
[laughter]

53:41.092 --> 53:43.845
As if, collectively,
you were all just like, "Well...

53:44.471 --> 53:45.722
[laughter]

53:45.805 --> 53:47.140
What does it look like?"

53:49.142 --> 53:50.393
I'm not gonna lie to you.

53:50.477 --> 53:54.898
It still looks like a dead body,
but it looks way fucking better...

53:55.774 --> 53:58.068
than that blow-up doll from 30 years ago.

53:58.151 --> 53:59.444
And that's what scares me.

53:59.527 --> 54:02.030
Because everything gets better. Right?

54:02.113 --> 54:05.408
You look at when cars first came out,
the stupid horn... Ah-oo-ga.

54:05.492 --> 54:08.036
You had to crank-start it,
you'd run over your best friend.

54:08.870 --> 54:11.122
Now you can start one up
with a remote control from, like,

54:11.206 --> 54:12.249
50 yards away.

54:12.832 --> 54:15.502
Right?
Remember when airbags first came out?

54:15.585 --> 54:17.045
They just had one for the driver.

54:17.128 --> 54:18.380
[squeals] Ah!

54:19.547 --> 54:21.007
"My family!

54:21.091 --> 54:22.092
[laughter]

54:22.175 --> 54:23.969
[sobs]

54:24.844 --> 54:26.429
Oh, my God!

54:27.514 --> 54:29.057
Oh, my God!

54:29.933 --> 54:32.394
Why would you just save me?"

54:32.477 --> 54:33.478
[laughter]

54:35.105 --> 54:38.441
And then, eventually,
they got airbags for everybody.

54:40.527 --> 54:43.238
Well, these robot sex dolls
are gonna be no different.

54:43.822 --> 54:46.574
Okay? They're just gonna keep getting
better and better and better,

54:46.658 --> 54:48.493
and these fucking nerds are not gonna be

54:48.576 --> 54:51.121
making any regular-looking robot dolls,
right?

54:51.204 --> 54:52.455
You know, some girl next door,

54:52.539 --> 54:55.542
you know, just some plain Jane,
the chick your mom likes, being like,

54:55.625 --> 54:58.086
"Well, there's a nice girl
you could settle down with.

54:58.169 --> 55:00.380
She knows how to cook." Fuck that.

55:00.463 --> 55:02.841
They're gonna make
Victoria's Secret supermodels,

55:02.924 --> 55:05.510
just absolute, like,
Paris runway-looking supermodels,

55:05.593 --> 55:07.512
and you're gonna come home
to one of these things

55:07.595 --> 55:09.180
and it's gonna laugh at all your jokes.

55:09.264 --> 55:12.600
[robotic laughing]

55:14.060 --> 55:16.604
It's gonna sit down
and watch the game with you, like,

55:16.688 --> 55:18.773
"It doesn't get any better than this.

55:19.983 --> 55:21.401
Yes, it does!"

55:21.484 --> 55:22.569
Ah!

55:22.652 --> 55:24.070
Ah!

55:24.988 --> 55:26.072
Ah!

55:26.948 --> 55:28.742
And it's gonna get up
and make you a fucking,

55:28.825 --> 55:32.620
I don't know, Bundt cake or a meat pie,
whatever the fuck you people eat, right?

55:32.704 --> 55:33.788
[laughter]

55:34.164 --> 55:36.374
There's not gonna be a human woman in here

55:36.458 --> 55:38.168
that's gonna be able
to compete with that...

55:38.835 --> 55:41.296
for longer than 90 minutes,
even on your birthday!

55:41.379 --> 55:43.298
By the third trip to the fridge,
she'll be like,

55:43.381 --> 55:46.634
"Fucking get it yourself!
What am I, your slave? Go fuck yourself!"

55:47.594 --> 55:50.347
And after you've been with
one of these robots, like, sex dolls,

55:50.430 --> 55:53.058
you're not gonna be able
to go back to a real woman.

55:53.141 --> 55:56.436
Right, with all her hopes and dreams...
and her needs.

55:57.604 --> 56:00.190
You're gonna be coming home.
She's like, "What is going on with you?

56:00.273 --> 56:02.400
We're not connecting.
We need a date night."

56:02.484 --> 56:05.528
All you'll be thinking is, like,
"How do I shut this fucking thing off?

56:06.363 --> 56:10.450
What, is it on nagging mode?
Why isn't it blowing me right now?

56:10.533 --> 56:12.494
I clearly entered the room.

56:12.577 --> 56:15.955
I entered the room. It's supposed
to drop to its knees and blow me.

56:16.039 --> 56:17.248
I don't understand."

56:17.874 --> 56:20.877
Yeah, like, your ego is gonna be at,
like, a dictator level.

56:21.211 --> 56:27.884
Like, "Me and my man tits have arrived!
Service me! Say that I am your lord!"

56:30.428 --> 56:33.348
Yeah, that's it. You're not gonna be able
to go back to a real woman,

56:33.431 --> 56:36.226
and then nobody's gonna be fucking women,
so they're gonna get lonely,

56:36.309 --> 56:39.104
so they'll have to create a doll
for you guys, right? A giant fucking...

56:39.187 --> 56:41.606
I don't know what you guys are into.
I don't pretend to know.

56:41.689 --> 56:44.984
Like, some giant Brad Pitt-looking
fucking robot doll,

56:45.068 --> 56:48.446
fucking eight-pack abs,
a robot dick down to the floor.

56:48.530 --> 56:49.447
You know?

56:49.531 --> 56:52.575
Holds both your hands
when you tell a story. All right?

56:52.659 --> 56:55.078
[laughter and applause]

56:55.161 --> 56:58.998
Whatever you're into!
Opens a bottle of wine at 12 noon.

56:59.082 --> 57:01.334
"It's got to be five o'clock somewhere."

57:01.418 --> 57:04.212
[robotic laughing]

57:07.132 --> 57:11.594
Yeah. I think they're gonna
fuck us into extinction.

57:11.678 --> 57:14.013
'Cause at that point,
the only people left having sex

57:14.097 --> 57:17.642
with other human beings
are gonna be hipsters and the homeless.

57:17.725 --> 57:20.770
Right? Because hipsters,
they love all the old shit, right?

57:20.854 --> 57:23.773
Cassette tapes, Frisbees,
dressing like a cobbler...

57:23.857 --> 57:26.109
Whatever the fuck it is they're doing,
right?

57:26.943 --> 57:30.280
But even a homeless guy, you know, after,
like, I don't know, a couple of years,

57:30.363 --> 57:34.909
he'll be able to drag some old,
one-legged, fucked-out robot model

57:34.993 --> 57:38.872
out of the trash,
drag it back to its lair.

57:39.873 --> 57:41.875
That thing will still be building him up,
you know,

57:41.958 --> 57:44.961
just laying there, like,
"I don't think you smell that bad."

57:45.044 --> 57:47.380
[robotic laughing]

57:48.381 --> 57:51.634
"This is my favorite bridge."
[robotic laughing]

57:55.638 --> 57:56.598
Yeah.

57:56.681 --> 57:59.434
And we're all gonna fucking die off,
and what's gonna be left

57:59.517 --> 58:03.813
to fight these robots off is gonna be
an entire generation of hipster spawn.

58:04.522 --> 58:07.400
Yeah!
And they're gonna go to war ironically.

58:07.609 --> 58:08.735
[laughter]

58:08.818 --> 58:10.570
Yeah. Dressing... Dressed like...

58:10.653 --> 58:13.323
I don't know,
fucking growing Civil War beards,

58:13.406 --> 58:15.783
dressing like Star Wars action figures,

58:15.867 --> 58:18.036
and they are gonna get
fucking slaughtered!

58:19.537 --> 58:21.289
And right when
they get down to the last 30,

58:21.372 --> 58:23.082
there's gonna be
a liberal robot going like,

58:23.166 --> 58:26.085
"We should save a few for posterity."

58:26.169 --> 58:29.255
Right? And they're just gonna
stick them in a zoo...

58:29.339 --> 58:31.466
and be this little hodgepodge
of what was left.

58:31.549 --> 58:35.053
You know, black, white, Latin, Asian,
gay, straight, trans, whatever.

58:35.136 --> 58:36.638
Whatever the fuck, right?

58:37.680 --> 58:39.891
And they're still gonna be
arguing with each other.

58:41.684 --> 58:43.603
The robots will just be
standing outside, going,

58:43.686 --> 58:46.397
"I love it when they cross their legs."
[laughs robotically]

58:47.398 --> 58:48.525
[laughs]

58:51.486 --> 58:55.406
Yeah. And this is the fucking world
that I brought my daughter into.

58:55.490 --> 58:59.619
Like, I actually...
am legitimately scared about them.

59:00.954 --> 59:04.415
I don't know. I gotta tell you, though,
becoming a dad was the greatest...

59:04.499 --> 59:06.626
is the greatest fucking thing
that ever happened to me.

59:06.709 --> 59:08.753
It really is.
I don't have any jokes about my kid.

59:08.836 --> 59:10.421
-No, it is.
-[cheering and applause]

59:10.505 --> 59:13.216
And you're applauding my wife.
She did all the work.

59:13.758 --> 59:14.676
Yeah.

59:15.176 --> 59:18.805
Yeah, knocking a woman up, that's easy.
You just have fun. You...

59:18.888 --> 59:20.974
Unprotected sex, bam,
you knock them up,

59:21.057 --> 59:22.809
and then they have to deal with it.
You know?

59:22.892 --> 59:26.604
No matter how much they try to drag you
into it, it really is, it's their show.

59:27.397 --> 59:29.315
You know? I always say my wife...

59:29.399 --> 59:32.610
When my wife was pregnant, I'd say,
"My wife, you know, she's pregnant."

59:32.694 --> 59:36.614
Then I have these people like, "Excuse me,
you're supposed to say, 'We're pregnant.'

59:36.698 --> 59:39.284
You're supposed to say, 'We're pregnant.'"

59:39.367 --> 59:43.871
It's like, "Well, I'm not a seahorse,
so I'm not fucking pregnant."

59:43.955 --> 59:45.873
My wife is pregnant.
She's putting on weight,

59:45.957 --> 59:48.710
her feet are swelling up. You know,
she's miserable. Fucking miserable.

59:48.793 --> 59:52.046
I'm still doing pull-ups.
I'm crushing it while being pregnant.

59:52.130 --> 59:55.717
I'm still drinking, smoking, yeah.
[chuckles]

59:56.968 --> 01:00:00.555
No, the only thing that sucked
was I had to get rid of my dog.

01:00:00.638 --> 01:00:02.432
Yeah. Had to find her a new home.

01:00:02.515 --> 01:00:05.059
Well, I finally had to admit
that she was fucking crazy.

01:00:05.143 --> 01:00:09.522
I got a crazy rescue dog and, uh, yeah,
it was one of these fucking dogs, man.

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:14.027
It tried to kill both of my parents.
It tried to kill my father-in-law.

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:15.903
It bit one of my friends.

01:00:15.987 --> 01:00:17.905
I'd have family come over,
friends or whatever,

01:00:17.989 --> 01:00:20.658
we'd have to stick it in the back room,
like, lock the door.

01:00:20.742 --> 01:00:23.494
For the first hour, it'd just be
throwing itself up against the door.

01:00:23.578 --> 01:00:27.373
"I'll fucking kill all you motherfuckers!
I'll kill all you motherfuckers!"

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:29.292
Looking under the door,
"I can see your feet!

01:00:29.375 --> 01:00:30.960
I know what you smell like!

01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:34.255
I'll follow you home. I'll find you.
I'll fucking kill all of you!"

01:00:35.214 --> 01:00:36.674
And we were just in total denial,

01:00:36.758 --> 01:00:42.096
like, "No, she's just a little, you know,
a little scared... 'cause she was abused."

01:00:42.764 --> 01:00:44.766
And we got, like,
a trainer and all of that shit,

01:00:44.849 --> 01:00:47.226
and he finally said,
"Listen, man, this is one of these dogs

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:50.229
nature said no to,
but people said yes to."

01:00:51.105 --> 01:00:54.776
So I'm like, "Jesus Christ, you could've
told me that 10,000 fucking dollars ago!"

01:00:54.859 --> 01:00:55.693
You know?

01:00:56.402 --> 01:00:58.071
So now my wife,
she's five months pregnant,

01:00:58.154 --> 01:00:59.989
she's six months, seven,
eight months pregnant.

01:01:00.073 --> 01:01:02.909
It's just the fucking...
this thing just hanging over my head,

01:01:02.992 --> 01:01:05.536
and finally I said to my wife,
"We gotta do something about this."

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:08.623
I'm not gonna be this guy in the news,
being like, "Well, you know, uh,

01:01:08.706 --> 01:01:11.751
the dog loved me and my wife,
so I figured it'd be all right

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:13.628
to let it sleep near the bassinet.

01:01:13.711 --> 01:01:16.714
And, well, you can imagine my surprise
the next morning..."

01:01:17.423 --> 01:01:21.928
Yeah. I wasn't gonna be that guy
in the news whose dog ate his baby. Right?

01:01:22.762 --> 01:01:24.013
I gotta get rid of this thing.

01:01:24.097 --> 01:01:27.183
So we called my trainer,
and he goes, "All right, I'll take it."

01:01:27.266 --> 01:01:30.103
Okay, thank God they're not gonna
put the dog down or anything like that,

01:01:30.186 --> 01:01:32.814
so I'm like, "Thank God."
So he goes, "I'll come back in a week."

01:01:32.897 --> 01:01:36.442
And it was very sad
because we both loved this dog, like,

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:37.944
with all our hearts, right?

01:01:38.027 --> 01:01:40.196
And what amazed me, though,
was over that week,

01:01:40.279 --> 01:01:43.449
the way my wife handled grief versus me.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.619
It was so mature.
She just, like, took it on.

01:01:47.161 --> 01:01:50.832
I just went into denial. I was just like,
"Well, I'm not giving it away tomorrow,

01:01:50.915 --> 01:01:52.250
so I'm not gonna think about it."

01:01:52.333 --> 01:01:54.919
And I just called the dog up on the bed,
started petting her

01:01:55.002 --> 01:01:57.880
and lashing out at people
for no fucking reason. Right?

01:01:57.964 --> 01:02:01.008
My wife just went into the bathroom
that night. She was brushing her teeth.

01:02:01.092 --> 01:02:02.635
I could just hear her quietly crying.

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:04.846
[weeping]

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:08.766
I swear to God, I was on the bed,
and I literally... I got mad at her.

01:02:09.851 --> 01:02:12.895
I didn't yell at her.
Just... I had it just internal, you know?

01:02:13.646 --> 01:02:16.941
And I was just thinking, like,
"Why is she having the proper emotion

01:02:17.024 --> 01:02:18.359
in this fucking moment?

01:02:19.902 --> 01:02:22.405
Why isn't she just blocking it out
the fucking way I am?" Right?

01:02:22.488 --> 01:02:24.615
"Just don't deal with it
till you fucking give it away,

01:02:24.699 --> 01:02:27.493
and then just start yelling at people.
The way I do." Right?

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:30.663
That's what we did. I blocked it out,
and every night, she would cry a bit more.

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:32.457
The whole week... [weeping]

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:35.376
Till the night before, she's like...
[sobs loudly]

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:40.047
Right? And what I didn't realize was
she had cried herself into acceptance.

01:02:40.131 --> 01:02:43.760
And meanwhile, my emotions
were still at the starting line.

01:02:43.843 --> 01:02:47.597
And there's a knock at the door, and she
goes, "Okay, he's here. Go get the dog."

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:50.349
And I'm like, "Hey, Cleo!"
And she popped her head up,

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:52.894
and I saw her wagging her fucking tail,
and all of a sudden,

01:02:52.977 --> 01:02:56.898
eight years of conditional love
all started bubbling up, and I was like,

01:02:56.981 --> 01:03:00.193
"Oh, fuck, not now! Not now!"

01:03:00.943 --> 01:03:03.362
So I just pushed it down. [grunts]

01:03:04.030 --> 01:03:06.365
I just walked at her
like some weird game show host.

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:09.869
"Hey, how are you?
I'm smiling for no reason, all right?

01:03:09.952 --> 01:03:12.997
Now we're going for a walk.
I'm just gonna say what we're doing

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:15.082
so I don't think about what I'm feeling."

01:03:15.166 --> 01:03:18.419
And I just walked out,
handed the leash to the new owner,

01:03:18.503 --> 01:03:21.172
pet her on the head,
didn't even look her in the eye,

01:03:21.255 --> 01:03:23.382
'cause I knew I couldn't,
and just turned around

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:25.593
and walked away from something
that I had loved

01:03:25.676 --> 01:03:28.596
more than I had loved anything in my life
up to that point.

01:03:28.679 --> 01:03:30.681
Don't tell my wife. All right?

01:03:30.765 --> 01:03:32.016
[laughter]

01:03:32.099 --> 01:03:33.476
Then I come back into the house.

01:03:33.559 --> 01:03:35.978
She's just looking at me.
She knows I'm out of my fucking mind.

01:03:36.062 --> 01:03:37.939
She's like, "Are you okay?
Everything all right?

01:03:38.022 --> 01:03:40.107
Wanna talk about it?
We could go get something to eat?"

01:03:40.191 --> 01:03:43.277
I'm like, "No, I'm fine. Sometimes,
you have to be up here and think logical,

01:03:43.361 --> 01:03:46.614
and not be in your heart. I'm just gonna
go into the bathroom for a second."

01:03:46.697 --> 01:03:50.535
And I went in, and I closed the door,
and for 0.8 seconds,

01:03:50.618 --> 01:03:55.081
cried like a little boy,
before I put the lid back on the jar.

01:03:56.082 --> 01:03:59.752
Fastened it back
and just added it to the shelf of anger

01:04:00.253 --> 01:04:02.046
that sits in every man's chest.

01:04:03.631 --> 01:04:04.465
Yeah.

01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:06.425
[cheering and applause]

01:04:06.509 --> 01:04:11.389
And I couldn't help but wonder
in that moment who that I love in my life

01:04:11.472 --> 01:04:13.850
is gonna pay for that in the future.

01:04:13.933 --> 01:04:15.101
[laughter]

01:04:15.184 --> 01:04:19.188
Like, where am I gonna be?
Family reunion, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond...

01:04:19.272 --> 01:04:21.107
"How many fucking towels do we need?

01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:23.568
Jesus Christ,
it's a fucking sickness with you!"

01:04:23.818 --> 01:04:25.611
"Where is this coming from?

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:29.115
I just don't understand
where this is coming from."

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:33.536
Listen, you guys are so awesome.
Thank you so much for coming out.

01:04:33.619 --> 01:04:36.080
I had a great time. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

01:04:36.163 --> 01:04:38.165
[cheering and applause]

01:04:41.919 --> 01:04:44.130
Seriously, thank you, guys, so much.

01:04:44.213 --> 01:04:47.300
It's been the best two days of my life.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

01:04:47.383 --> 01:04:48.509
Good night!

01:04:48.593 --> 01:04:50.595
[cheering continues]

01:05:10.031 --> 01:05:12.033
[background chatter]
