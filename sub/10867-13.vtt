00:30.949 --> 00:33.117
Big fire tonight
guys, I'm freezing!

00:33.117 --> 00:35.995
Man, it is cold!

00:37.997 --> 00:39.081
[achoo!]

00:39.081 --> 00:41.459
Hey, point that someplace else!

00:41.459 --> 00:42.668
Sorry.

00:42.668 --> 00:44.169
Gesundheit.

00:44.169 --> 00:45.546
You getting a cold?

00:45.546 --> 00:47.840
Nah, just allergies.

00:47.840 --> 00:48.883
[achoo!]

00:48.883 --> 00:49.926
You sure?

00:49.926 --> 00:51.176
Didn't you get a flu shot?

00:51.176 --> 00:52.637
No way.

00:52.637 --> 00:54.013
You got a flu shot?

00:54.013 --> 00:55.723
Every year.

00:55.723 --> 00:56.766
Don't you guys?

00:56.766 --> 00:57.850
Not me.

00:57.850 --> 00:58.893
Me neither.

00:58.893 --> 01:00.311
I have a thing about needles.

01:00.311 --> 01:01.771
But it's just a little shot...

01:01.771 --> 01:03.731
and it's better
than getting sick.

01:03.731 --> 01:06.400
Nothin's worse
than gettin' a shot.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.444
Really.

01:08.444 --> 01:12.364
Well, I can think of something.

01:12.364 --> 01:18.788
And it's exactly
what my story's about.

01:18.788 --> 01:21.165
If you get really sick,
somebody's gotta

01:21.165 --> 01:22.500
take care of you.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.502
Somebody who knows
how to make you better.

01:24.502 --> 01:26.211
And you have to
trust that person,

01:26.211 --> 01:28.464
cuz they know
what's best for you.

01:28.464 --> 01:29.184
Right?

01:30.424 --> 01:32.217
Well...

01:32.217 --> 01:35.220
what would happen if the person
who was taking care of you,

01:35.220 --> 01:41.477
was the one person in the
world you should fear the most?

01:41.477 --> 01:43.395
And nobody believed you...

01:43.395 --> 01:45.397
nobody knew...

01:45.397 --> 01:48.693
and nobody could help.

01:51.654 --> 01:54.740
Submitted for the approval
of the Midnight Society,

01:54.740 --> 01:57.785
I call this story...

02:04.917 --> 02:07.920
Bye mom, bye dad!
Have a good trip!

02:07.920 --> 02:10.422
Bye mom and dad!
We're gonna miss you so much!

02:10.422 --> 02:12.717
We love you!

02:13.759 --> 02:15.260
Yes!

02:15.260 --> 02:17.847
A whole month with no
one to tell us what to do.

02:17.847 --> 02:19.057
What about Gramps?

02:19.057 --> 02:21.475
I can handle Gramps.

02:21.475 --> 02:22.810
Pick up the suitcases.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.979
What???
Girls!

02:24.979 --> 02:26.271
Grandpa!

02:26.271 --> 02:28.066
My two angels!

02:28.066 --> 02:30.068
Let's get you out of this cold!

02:30.068 --> 02:33.863
I said grab the bags.

02:33.863 --> 02:38.951
Why do I suddenly
feel like Cinderella?

03:06.228 --> 03:08.731
Hey AJ?
-What?

03:22.078 --> 03:24.830
You are dead and buried!

03:25.456 --> 03:28.042
LOOK OUT!

03:35.841 --> 03:36.968
Where'd they go?

03:36.968 --> 03:39.178
Inside, I guess.
Come on.

03:47.103 --> 03:49.730
Don't you go tracking
snow into this house,

03:49.730 --> 03:51.065
missies.

03:51.065 --> 03:52.691
We just came in to apologize.

03:52.691 --> 03:54.026
For what?

03:54.026 --> 03:56.361
AJ almost hit that
lady with a snowball.

03:56.361 --> 03:57.362
Gee thanks.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.031
What lady?

03:59.031 --> 04:01.659
The one who came in with a
little boy, carrying presents.

04:01.659 --> 04:03.869
Birthday presents?

04:03.869 --> 04:05.704
Yeah.
Where is she?

04:05.704 --> 04:07.581
There's nobody here.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.792
But we just saw a
lady and a boy...

04:09.792 --> 04:14.254
I said, there's nobody here.

04:30.688 --> 04:38.070
[child crying in the distance]

05:04.513 --> 05:07.933
Hello?
Who's down there?

05:47.098 --> 05:49.725
SURPRISE!
[screams]

05:52.144 --> 05:55.856
AJ!
What is your malfunction?

06:03.488 --> 06:05.490
There must have been
a party next door.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.409
It wasn't next door.

06:07.409 --> 06:08.994
I saw people in the dining room!

06:08.994 --> 06:12.039
What a shame, twelve
years old and already demented.

06:12.039 --> 06:12.998
I'm NOT!

06:12.998 --> 06:14.666
I know what I saw!

06:14.666 --> 06:17.253
Hush up now, eat your breakfast.

06:18.087 --> 06:20.965
You can't have that!

06:20.965 --> 06:21.685
Nicki!

06:23.259 --> 06:24.760
What now?

06:24.760 --> 06:26.428
AJ's allergic to strawberries!

06:26.428 --> 06:29.723
One bite and bloat city.
It's disgusting.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.601
I am sorry honey.
I forgot.

06:32.601 --> 06:33.811
It's okay.

06:33.811 --> 06:35.520
I was going to eat around them.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.315
Let me clean up that mess.

06:37.315 --> 06:41.193
Don't gramps.
It's AJ's mess, she'll do it.

07:25.237 --> 07:26.905
LOOK OUT!

07:32.119 --> 07:33.199
Ahhhhhhh!

07:36.832 --> 07:39.335
AJ, What? What is going on?

07:39.335 --> 07:41.379
What's all the fuss?

07:41.379 --> 07:43.672
I saw a girl, she disappeared.

07:43.672 --> 07:45.549
Did you see the birthday girl?

07:45.549 --> 07:46.629
You know?

07:56.060 --> 08:00.314
I was hoping you girls wouldn't
be bothered while you were here.

08:00.314 --> 08:03.650
I didn't want you
getting all scared.

08:03.650 --> 08:06.153
Bothered by what?

08:06.153 --> 08:06.993
Well...

08:08.864 --> 08:12.368
the ghosts.

08:12.368 --> 08:14.828
You see, a long time
ago, a little girl

08:14.828 --> 08:16.788
-just about your age, AJ -

08:16.788 --> 08:19.541
fell down the front stairs
during her birthday party.

08:19.541 --> 08:20.876
That's what I saw!

08:20.876 --> 08:22.211
She was carrying presents!

08:22.211 --> 08:23.337
It was her birthday!

08:23.337 --> 08:24.755
She died on her birthday?

08:24.755 --> 08:26.673
She didn't die in the fall.

08:26.673 --> 08:29.093
She hurt her leg and
had to stay in bed.

08:29.093 --> 08:32.263
The girl's mother hired a nurse
to take care of her at night.

08:32.263 --> 08:36.767
But, as the story
goes, the nurse was...

08:36.767 --> 08:39.644
a little crazy...

08:39.644 --> 08:41.480
One night when the
girl was asleep,

08:41.480 --> 08:44.442
the crazy nurse filled a
hypodermic needle with poison,

08:44.442 --> 08:47.403
and gave it her while she slept.

08:47.403 --> 08:50.448
Poor thing never woke up.

08:50.448 --> 08:51.615
She was murdered?

08:51.615 --> 08:52.616
Why?

08:52.616 --> 08:53.909
Nobody knows.

08:53.909 --> 08:55.494
The night nurse claimed
she was innocent

08:55.494 --> 08:58.580
till the day she died

08:58.580 --> 09:00.749
in prison.

09:00.749 --> 09:02.042
Cool!

09:02.042 --> 09:04.753
Not cool, sad.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.255
How do you know all this?

09:06.255 --> 09:10.050
This trunk was up here
when I bought the place.

09:10.050 --> 09:13.387
Family must have forgot it.

09:17.766 --> 09:21.353
That's the girl I saw
fall down the stairs!

09:21.353 --> 09:22.980
Her name was Emily.

09:22.980 --> 09:26.400
Look!
It's her birthday dress!

09:30.904 --> 09:34.325
Night Nurse
Convicted in Death of Girl.

09:34.325 --> 09:35.742
What a creep.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.536
Why do you think
she keeps coming back?

09:37.536 --> 09:38.954
Unfinished business.

09:38.954 --> 09:41.415
That's always why
ghosts come back.

09:41.415 --> 09:44.168
Maybe she wants to
tell us something.

09:44.168 --> 09:47.004
Now that you know, I don't
want you girls messing around

09:47.004 --> 09:48.839
where you don't belong.

09:48.839 --> 09:53.927
Let the dead rest in peace.
Understand?

10:03.103 --> 10:04.480
We shouldn't do this.

10:04.480 --> 10:05.856
Grampa doesn't want
us messing with...

10:05.856 --> 10:07.774
Stop being a wuss.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.568
You're the one who
said the ghost

10:09.568 --> 10:11.028
is trying to tell us something.

10:11.028 --> 10:12.863
Yeah but...
-No yeah buts...

10:12.863 --> 10:15.032
let's do it.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.869
Happy birthday Emily.

10:18.869 --> 10:21.288
Yeah Happy Birthday.
We've got a cake for you.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.498
It's really good!

10:22.498 --> 10:25.625
I put your name on
it and everything.

10:34.259 --> 10:37.095
Suddenly I'm
feeling really dumb.

10:37.095 --> 10:38.222
Yeah, me too.

10:38.222 --> 10:40.015
At least we get to eat the cake.

10:40.015 --> 10:41.766
Make a wish.
OK.

10:41.766 --> 10:44.436
I wish we could make
that ghost appear.

10:47.898 --> 10:50.734
Time for your medicine.

10:51.485 --> 10:52.735
AHHH!

10:57.575 --> 10:58.909
She was right here!

10:58.909 --> 11:00.452
With a needle!

11:00.452 --> 11:03.038
I knew you two were going
to scare yourself to death

11:03.038 --> 11:04.498
with this ghost business.

11:04.498 --> 11:05.832
But it's true!
It was the Night Nurse...

11:05.832 --> 11:07.459
or her ghost.

11:07.459 --> 11:09.545
The only ghost I've seen
in all the years I've

11:09.545 --> 11:12.172
lived here is that poor,
harmless little girl.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.632
But you could see her!

11:13.632 --> 11:14.633
But nothing!

11:14.633 --> 11:16.218
Forget about ghosts...

11:16.218 --> 11:18.929
and clean up this mess.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.353
You gonna help?

11:26.353 --> 11:29.314
I've got a better idea.

11:58.051 --> 12:02.180
Don't worry, I
cleaned up the mess myself.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.641
What are you doing?

12:03.641 --> 12:05.225
If the ghost is trying
to tell us something,

12:05.225 --> 12:07.227
maybe we should try
to figure it out.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.604
Any luck?

12:08.604 --> 12:09.354
No.

12:19.114 --> 12:21.992
You know, this thing
needs a better...

12:21.992 --> 12:24.202
zipper.

12:29.749 --> 12:35.880
Hey, check the pockets
to see if... AJ?

12:35.880 --> 12:41.595
Nicki? Nicki,
Where are you?

12:43.054 --> 12:46.850
Better question, where am I?

12:46.850 --> 12:47.600
AJ!

13:19.841 --> 13:24.888
Emily! Bring your presents
downstairs so you can open them!

13:24.888 --> 13:25.638
Me?

13:26.640 --> 13:32.229
Who else, birthday girl? Look
at you all pretty in that dress!

13:39.737 --> 13:42.280
It's the dress, I gotta get it...

13:42.280 --> 13:43.280
Off!

13:44.366 --> 13:45.950
What happened to you?!

13:45.950 --> 13:49.162
I put this dress on and
went back in time!

13:49.162 --> 13:51.164
What???
-And people thought I was Emily!

13:51.164 --> 13:53.166
They were having a
birthday party for me,

13:53.166 --> 13:55.001
I mean for her, but I was her!

13:55.001 --> 13:56.086
She was me!

13:56.086 --> 13:57.087
It was unreal!

13:57.087 --> 13:58.714
Get outta here.

13:58.714 --> 14:00.882
I'm serious! The dress made
me go back in time...

14:00.882 --> 14:01.883
to Emily's party!

14:01.883 --> 14:02.967
Yeah right.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.135
Was the nurse there?

14:04.135 --> 14:07.138
There you are!

14:07.138 --> 14:08.515
Uh oh.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.934
Not afraid of a
little needle are we?

14:10.934 --> 14:12.394
She wants to give us the poison!

14:12.394 --> 14:14.020
Not us...
you!

14:14.020 --> 14:15.773
You're the one they
thought was Emily.

14:15.773 --> 14:18.692
You want to tell her that?

14:18.692 --> 14:19.693
What are we gonna do?

14:19.693 --> 14:21.403
I don't know.

14:21.403 --> 14:24.239
Don't make me
angry, open the door.

14:24.239 --> 14:26.032
AJ??

14:26.032 --> 14:27.659
Wait...
the dress!

14:27.659 --> 14:28.910
What about it?

14:28.910 --> 14:30.662
I can go back in
time and become Emily.

14:30.662 --> 14:31.789
And what, open her presents?

14:31.789 --> 14:33.540
No! I know
what happened!

14:33.540 --> 14:36.251
If I go back in time, I'll
make sure I don't fall

14:36.251 --> 14:38.712
down the stairs like Emily did.
-And...?

14:38.712 --> 14:42.006
If I don't fall, I won't
get hurt and if I don't get hurt

14:42.006 --> 14:44.217
then I... I mean...
Emily, won't need a nurse.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.928
And if the nurse never shows up
then she can't murder Emily.

14:46.928 --> 14:48.513
Right!

14:48.513 --> 14:51.141
No murdering nurse, no
ghost of a murdering nurse...

14:51.141 --> 14:52.142
And we're saved!

14:52.142 --> 14:54.102
Excellent!

14:54.102 --> 14:55.895
I'm losing my patience.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.773
You're losing
both your patients!

14:57.773 --> 14:58.774
Gimme the dress.

14:58.774 --> 15:00.150
What!
Why?

15:00.150 --> 15:05.280
I'm the one going back!

15:05.280 --> 15:07.866
But I'm the one they thought
was Emily, not you!

15:07.866 --> 15:10.243
This is too important, I
don't want you messin' up.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.120
[banging]
Darn!

15:12.120 --> 15:15.874
I'm not gonna mess up, and
the dress doesn't fit you.

15:15.874 --> 15:17.626
I gotta go.

15:17.626 --> 15:20.044
For once you've
gotta do things my way.

15:21.254 --> 15:26.468
If you mess up
we're both history.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.810
All I gotta do is

15:35.686 --> 15:39.815
not fall down the stairs.

15:59.376 --> 16:00.585
There you are Emily.

16:00.585 --> 16:04.715
Come on down.
Bring your gifts.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.768
Be careful coming
down those stairs.

16:16.768 --> 16:21.314
Yeah, tell me about it.

16:28.196 --> 16:31.658
Last chance.
Are you going to open up.

16:31.658 --> 16:35.036
In your dreams, nursey-girl.

16:36.872 --> 16:37.712
Uh oh.!

16:59.436 --> 17:02.480
That's it!

17:08.862 --> 17:12.824
That's why Emily fell!

17:33.804 --> 17:38.683
I know you're hiding
somewhere...

17:48.526 --> 17:49.820
Ahhhh!

17:49.820 --> 17:52.906
Yes! I did it!

17:54.825 --> 17:55.545
Emily!

18:01.331 --> 18:03.750
This won't hurt us much.

18:04.668 --> 18:08.964
Well, maybe you a little.

18:08.964 --> 18:12.300
No!
Please, no!

18:16.387 --> 18:17.107
Emily!

18:20.684 --> 18:22.268
Someone call the doctor!

18:22.268 --> 18:22.988
Hurry!

18:31.653 --> 18:35.323
It seems I'm needed elsewhere.

18:35.323 --> 18:39.202
We'll finish this later.

18:41.705 --> 18:43.456
Ahhh!

18:52.423 --> 18:53.925
Nicki?

18:53.925 --> 18:56.887
Man, I just had
the weirdest dream.

18:56.887 --> 19:00.181
Time for your medicine.

19:01.892 --> 19:04.853
It seems we've had a nasty
little accident, Emily.

19:04.853 --> 19:05.937
I'm not Emily!

19:05.937 --> 19:07.188
Really?

19:07.188 --> 19:08.690
We must have a
touch of a fever too.

19:08.690 --> 19:10.525
Get away from me!

19:10.525 --> 19:14.112
After we've had our shot, we
won't have any more worries.

19:14.112 --> 19:16.907
I promise.

19:18.408 --> 19:21.661
Let's not do that again.

19:42.766 --> 19:44.101
You can't hide.

19:44.101 --> 19:48.438
I know all the
secrets of this old house.

19:51.524 --> 19:54.193
I gotta get outta here!

19:59.991 --> 20:01.952
It's only a matter of time!

20:01.952 --> 20:03.202
Ahhh!

20:09.208 --> 20:13.296
I told you, I know all the
secrets of this house...

20:13.296 --> 20:15.339
and it's time for your medicine!

20:16.549 --> 20:19.636
I am tired of this child.

20:19.636 --> 20:21.679
Take your medicine!

20:21.679 --> 20:23.723
No!
I will not let you poison me!

20:23.723 --> 20:25.308
This is for your own good.

20:25.308 --> 20:27.852
Is that what you tell
all the people you murder?

20:27.852 --> 20:28.853
Murder?

20:28.853 --> 20:30.730
Don't tempt me.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.816
One little pinch, that's
all, and the penicillin

20:32.816 --> 20:34.484
will make you better.

20:34.484 --> 20:37.403
No! I won't let you!
Get away from me!

20:37.403 --> 20:39.405
Penicillin?

20:54.545 --> 20:55.546
Wait!

20:55.546 --> 20:56.840
Emily's allergic...

20:56.840 --> 20:58.591
I mean, I'm
allergic to penicillin!

20:58.591 --> 21:00.343
Allergic?
No you're not!

21:00.343 --> 21:04.305
Yes I am! See?
It says so right here.

21:13.773 --> 21:18.444
Don't you ever take this
bracelet off again,

21:18.444 --> 21:20.655
do you hear me?

21:20.655 --> 21:22.335
I didn't know!

21:25.785 --> 21:28.412
You might have been killed!

21:28.412 --> 21:29.789
Well... yeah!

21:29.789 --> 21:32.209
Emily...

21:32.209 --> 21:34.919
I'm so sorry.

21:36.337 --> 21:38.840
No more shots, alright?

21:38.840 --> 21:42.301
Of course not.

21:43.887 --> 21:48.808
Let's help you off
with this dress.

21:57.150 --> 21:59.152
So Emily was allergic
to penicillin?

21:59.152 --> 22:00.153
Yeah.

22:00.153 --> 22:01.988
It was all a mistake.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.531
Who's that?

22:03.531 --> 22:06.659
Emily, grown up.
She didn't die.

22:06.659 --> 22:09.787
I guess that means
you didn't mess up.

22:11.915 --> 22:13.791
Awful quiet in here.

22:13.791 --> 22:16.669
You two aren't still
ghost hunting are you?

22:16.669 --> 22:17.754
Nope.

22:17.754 --> 22:20.548
Not anymore.

22:34.187 --> 22:35.563
The end.

22:35.563 --> 22:36.981
That was a great story.

22:36.981 --> 22:39.192
So the nurse didn't
mean to hurt Emily,

22:39.192 --> 22:40.902
she just made a mistake.

22:40.902 --> 22:42.403
Exactly.

22:42.403 --> 22:44.488
That's supposed to make
me want to get a flu shot?

22:44.488 --> 22:45.531
I don't think so!

22:45.531 --> 22:47.158
[achoo!]

22:47.158 --> 22:48.910
Would you please keep those
nasty germs to yourself?!

22:48.910 --> 22:50.078
[achoo!]

22:50.078 --> 22:51.370
Uh oh.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.040
Oh man, I hope I'M
not getting sick!

22:54.040 --> 22:55.917
[achoo!]

22:55.917 --> 22:58.795
This place is like
a nest full of -

22:58.795 --> 23:00.964
[achoo!]

23:00.964 --> 23:02.173
germs!

23:02.173 --> 23:05.009
Nobody breathe on anybody.

23:05.009 --> 23:06.761
We'll take
different routes home.

23:06.761 --> 23:07.481
Later!

23:18.439 --> 23:20.608
If they just got flu
shots they wouldn't...

23:20.608 --> 23:22.986
wouldn't...

23:22.986 --> 23:24.695
A-chooo!

23:24.695 --> 23:26.197
Oh man!

23:26.197 --> 23:28.950
YOU GUYS GOT ME SICK!!!
