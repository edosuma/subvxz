WEBVTT

00:03.237 --> 00:05.373
Help, please, please.

00:05.406 --> 00:08.209
Everyone who looks at me...

00:08.242 --> 00:09.777
...they think I did that to him.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.212
Did you murder
Lieutenant O'Connell?

00:11.245 --> 00:12.313
No.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.415
This injury, it's the result
of a left-handed swing.

00:14.448 --> 00:16.417
ABBY: Whoever murdered
Lieutenant O'Connell

00:16.450 --> 00:18.652
was a serial killer.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.821
Starting over can be
its own special kind of hell.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.290
Listen, we just broke
for lunch recess.

00:22.323 --> 00:24.592
There's a sushi place
around the corner.

00:24.625 --> 00:27.161
To whom did Mary Smith give
her statement 11 years ago?

00:27.195 --> 00:30.398
GIBBS: If I tell the truth,
Fornell loses everything.

00:30.431 --> 00:32.566
JUDGE: Agent Gibbs,
answer the question.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.602
FBI Agent Tobias Fornell.

00:34.635 --> 00:36.237
HICKS:
Agent Gibbs,

00:36.270 --> 00:38.472
thank you.

00:39.807 --> 00:41.475
SLOANE:
He knows we're here.

00:45.346 --> 00:46.247
Switch hitter.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.316
He played us.

00:48.349 --> 00:50.351
Game's not over.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.436
No, no, no, no, no.

01:12.173 --> 01:13.374
JONES:
Turn off the ignition

01:13.407 --> 01:15.943
and exit the vehicle
with your hands up.

01:19.813 --> 01:22.250
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
All right.

01:22.283 --> 01:23.184
Keep your hands up

01:23.217 --> 01:25.419
and slowly walk backwards
toward my voice.

01:25.453 --> 01:26.354
All right.

01:26.387 --> 01:28.456
Yo, look, I don't know
what you think I did.

01:28.489 --> 01:29.890
:
But I didn't do it.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.024
Stop.

01:31.058 --> 01:33.727
Put your hands behind your head,
interlace your fingers.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.867
Hey, hey. Whoa, man.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.369
Yo, I went to the
police academy, too, okay?

01:41.402 --> 01:43.137
I know my rights.

01:43.171 --> 01:44.405
SANCHEZ: Sir, the vehicle
you were driving

01:44.438 --> 01:46.640
was reported stolen.
What?

01:46.674 --> 01:49.443
No, I didn't steal anything.
This is my van.

01:49.477 --> 01:50.478
SANCHEZ: So you got
the registration?

01:50.511 --> 01:52.480
It's in the mail.

01:52.513 --> 01:53.481
SANCHEZ: You want to think
some more about that, sir?

01:53.514 --> 01:54.548
The system says otherwise.

01:54.582 --> 01:56.484
OZZIE:
Yo, listen to me, man.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.752
Yo, listen to me.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.588
I didn't steal this van.
Oh, my God.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.490
We got a 10-82.

02:02.523 --> 02:03.524
What?

02:03.557 --> 02:05.693
You think I
don't know what that means?

02:05.726 --> 02:07.361
I went to the academy.
Yeah, calm down, sir.

02:07.395 --> 02:09.163
All right, all right...
Yes.

02:09.197 --> 02:11.365
I stole the van. Okay,
I never saw it before today.

02:11.399 --> 02:12.400
Van's not mine, okay?

02:12.433 --> 02:14.335
But wh-whatever's going on
inside that barrel,

02:14.368 --> 02:15.469
I-I didn't do it.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.312
*

02:59.447 --> 03:00.381
Hey, Bishop.
Hmm?

03:00.414 --> 03:02.450
Did you hear what just happened?
Oh, yes, Nick.

03:02.483 --> 03:04.418
They-they just made an
announcement in the elevator.

03:04.452 --> 03:06.520
Okay, see,
when you're sarcastic,

03:06.554 --> 03:07.788
you're supposed to be funny.

03:07.821 --> 03:09.223
What happened?
Okay.

03:09.257 --> 03:11.392
McGee cracked
the Thomas Brown case

03:11.425 --> 03:12.526
for the San Diego office.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.962
What
He came in

03:14.995 --> 03:16.930
20 minutes early, did some
ninja stuff on the computer,

03:16.964 --> 03:18.332
and all of a sudden, boom!

03:18.366 --> 03:20.468
Another win
for the NCIS team, baby.

03:21.435 --> 03:22.470
There he is.

03:22.503 --> 03:24.472
Look at that heavy hitter, huh?

03:24.505 --> 03:26.006
Were you doing a victory lap
or something?
No.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.541
I was downstairs checking out

03:27.575 --> 03:29.310
our new car floor mats.
BISHOP:
Oh.

03:29.343 --> 03:30.611
We got new mats?
Yeah.

03:30.644 --> 03:32.246
Well, I noticed the ones
in our sedans

03:32.280 --> 03:33.547
were losing grips at the bottom.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.416
Didn't want anyone to slip
and get hurt,

03:35.449 --> 03:37.318
so I put in a request
and made it happen.

03:37.351 --> 03:38.552
Ever since you had
these two babies,

03:38.586 --> 03:39.887
you've been on fuego.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.555
Oh, that reminds me.
I'm compiling

03:41.589 --> 03:43.557
a video story anthology
for the twins,

03:43.591 --> 03:45.626
so if you two could contribute,
it would be great.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.528
Seriously, McGee, it's
like you're super dad

03:47.561 --> 03:49.997
with superhuman agent powers.
No.

03:50.030 --> 03:53.967
Superhuman powers means
you can lift a car off of a kid.

03:54.001 --> 03:54.902
Okay?

03:54.935 --> 03:57.471
Which I... I've done once.

03:57.505 --> 03:59.640
Dead body, boss?

03:59.673 --> 04:02.410
Eyes in the back of
your head, McGee.

04:02.443 --> 04:04.578
Navy commander in Alexandria.

04:04.612 --> 04:05.746
Come on. Let's go.

04:07.581 --> 04:08.816
You sensed the dead body.

04:08.849 --> 04:09.783
See?

04:09.817 --> 04:11.685
Superhuman agent powers.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.663
Ugh.

04:22.696 --> 04:25.599
Uh, victim is
Navy Commander James Willis.

04:25.633 --> 04:26.900
38 years old.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.503
Reported missing
a week ago today.

04:29.537 --> 04:31.071
That's about when I'd put
the time of death

04:31.104 --> 04:32.740
based on the decomposition.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.508
Gunshot wound to the head.

04:34.542 --> 04:35.743
Likely the cause of death,

04:35.776 --> 04:37.311
but I want
to get him back to autopsy,

04:37.345 --> 04:39.347
properly unpack him
before I make any assumptions.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.749
You know what they say.
"When you assume..."

04:41.782 --> 04:42.650
I don't.

04:42.683 --> 04:43.951
Well, right.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.018
I mean, you-you don't.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.520
You don't
because you have a gut,

04:46.554 --> 04:47.788
which is...

04:47.821 --> 04:49.323
way different.

04:49.357 --> 04:50.624
Uh, there are a bunch
of rags in there.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.025
Killer's DNA could be on them.
Yeah.

04:52.059 --> 04:54.027
I'll bring them up to Abby
as soon as I unpack him.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.829
Hey, boss.

04:56.864 --> 04:59.667
Guy's name is Ozzie Duncan.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.602
First he said he didn't steal
the van, then he says he did.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.104
GIBBS:
Which one is it?

05:04.137 --> 05:05.205
McGEE:
Second story checks out.

05:05.238 --> 05:08.409
He hot-wired the van
in a grocery store parking lot.

05:08.442 --> 05:09.410
He had no idea
what was in the back

05:09.443 --> 05:11.912
or that the van he was lifting
was even stolen.

05:11.945 --> 05:13.581
The van was originally stolen

05:13.614 --> 05:15.549
from outside the owner's house
ten days ago.

05:15.583 --> 05:17.585
That's just before
the commander went missing.

05:17.618 --> 05:18.786
Well, there's a good chance
the original thief

05:18.819 --> 05:20.854
was involved with the murder.
Next of kin?

05:20.888 --> 05:22.890
Reeves is, uh, talking
to the commander's wife now.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.758
WOMAN:
Last time

05:24.792 --> 05:28.095
I saw James was...

05:28.128 --> 05:30.564
the day he disappeared.
Yeah.

05:30.598 --> 05:32.833
A week ago today.
Yeah.

05:33.901 --> 05:36.937
He went to work.

05:36.970 --> 05:40.574
And after that, he stopped
to visit with his mother.

05:40.608 --> 05:42.610
The hospice nurse
said that he was there

05:42.643 --> 05:45.413
between 7:00 and 8:00, but...

05:45.446 --> 05:47.881
he never made it home
after that.

05:47.915 --> 05:50.418
And what about his mother?

05:50.451 --> 05:52.886
Did she remember
anything unusual?

05:52.920 --> 05:56.056
No. No, she was in hospice.

05:56.089 --> 05:58.592
She was...

05:58.626 --> 06:01.795
she was almost incoherent.

06:01.829 --> 06:03.964
She died two days later.

06:03.997 --> 06:05.533
I'm sorry.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.701
Do you ever just feel like...

06:07.735 --> 06:10.638
like it's all too much?

06:10.671 --> 06:12.806
I don't know

06:12.840 --> 06:15.543
how to live without him.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.878
Mrs. Willis...

06:17.911 --> 06:20.748
the CACO can connect you
with a grief counselor.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.683
No, I don't want a therapist.
I think

06:22.716 --> 06:23.884
it might be helpful
for you to sit down with...

06:23.917 --> 06:25.753
Everything that I told you,

06:25.786 --> 06:26.987
I told them all already

06:27.020 --> 06:28.622
when James went missing.

06:28.656 --> 06:30.190
I told the police,

06:30.223 --> 06:33.761
the Navy Absentee person,
the private investigator.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.062
None of them did their job.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.630
What P.I.?

06:36.664 --> 06:37.831
You said you spoke to
a private investigator.

06:37.865 --> 06:40.768
Who was it?

06:40.801 --> 06:43.036
I-I don't know.
I think I...

06:43.070 --> 06:46.940
Uh, I have his card in here.
Um...

06:46.974 --> 06:50.010
he came to the house
looking for James.

06:50.043 --> 06:53.614
I thought he was
working with NCIS.

06:53.647 --> 06:54.882
He wasn't?

06:54.915 --> 06:56.650
REEVES:
Gibbs.

06:56.684 --> 06:58.586
Yeah, there's a P.I.
working on this case.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.087
I think you're gonna want
to talk to him.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.691
MAN :
In the garage.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.846
Tobias.

07:27.681 --> 07:30.217
What the hell is going on?

07:30.250 --> 07:33.020
What's going on?

07:33.053 --> 07:35.623
You got me fired, remember?

07:37.691 --> 07:40.694
You're parking your car
in the driveway now.
You would've known that

07:40.728 --> 07:42.796
had you bothered
to answer any of my calls.

07:42.830 --> 07:46.667
Oh. Tobias C. Fornell,

07:46.700 --> 07:48.869
licensed private investigator.

07:52.706 --> 07:55.709
Ain't life grand?

08:05.152 --> 08:06.219
He is right behind me,

08:06.253 --> 08:07.555
and you got to say no.

08:07.588 --> 08:09.089
Say no to what?

08:10.257 --> 08:11.258
Director.

08:11.291 --> 08:13.193
It is good

08:13.226 --> 08:14.728
to see you.
Likewise.

08:14.762 --> 08:16.029
To what do I owe this pleasure?

08:16.063 --> 08:17.197
The Commander Willis case.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.166
It was my understanding...
Yeah.

08:19.199 --> 08:20.568
Yeah, I was canned
from the Bureau

08:20.601 --> 08:21.602
thanks to his testimony

08:21.635 --> 08:23.203
in court.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.205
Hey. It happens.

08:25.238 --> 08:26.306
I told him.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.308
We don't normally work
with P.I.s.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.877
Are you mad at me
for some reason?

08:29.910 --> 08:31.745
No.

08:31.779 --> 08:34.181
You're into P.I. work now?
I am,

08:34.214 --> 08:37.117
and I got to say,
it's been good for the soul.

08:38.085 --> 08:40.220
Anyway, your victim,

08:40.253 --> 08:42.189
Commander Willis, took out
Mm-hmm.

08:42.222 --> 08:43.557
multiple high-interest loans

08:43.591 --> 08:45.793
from a place called
Cash-Line Direct.

08:45.826 --> 08:47.327
He was late in paying them back.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.731
The company's collection calls
went unanswered for weeks.

08:50.764 --> 08:52.099
And they hired you
to track him down.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.333
When I showed up at the door,

08:53.366 --> 08:55.202
wife told me
that he was missing.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.536
And that was yesterday.

08:57.671 --> 08:58.939
It was three days ago.

08:58.972 --> 09:01.174
So you got a jump on tracking

09:01.208 --> 09:02.810
Commander Willis' movements.

09:02.843 --> 09:04.645
And I'm more than willing
to share what I have so far.

09:04.678 --> 09:07.815
Well, using Agent... Mr. Fornell

09:07.848 --> 09:09.316
as a source

09:09.349 --> 09:11.318
makes sense to me.

09:11.351 --> 09:12.986
Gibbs?

09:15.355 --> 09:16.189
Sure.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.191
Then have at it.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.994
I'll run the briefing
from my office.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.262
Director, it is so good

09:22.295 --> 09:24.564
to be working with you again.
Likewise.

09:28.368 --> 09:31.071
It's impressive.

09:31.104 --> 09:33.674
Does this desk make me
look important, guys?

09:33.707 --> 09:35.809
I really like the vibe in here.

09:35.843 --> 09:37.377
Still no sign of Gibbs?

09:37.410 --> 09:38.979
Oh.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.347
Uh, well, actually,
he just called.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.315
He said he got held up
and to start without him.

09:42.349 --> 09:44.985
Oh.

09:45.018 --> 09:47.187
Then let's do this.

09:50.758 --> 09:54.261
Our victim, Commander Willis,
worked at the Pentagon.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.063
McGEE: Job could've gotten him
mixed up in something.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.198
Unlikely. He worked
in the Support Services office.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.232
Dealt with phones

09:59.266 --> 10:01.034
and equipment maintenance.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.269
Nothing classified.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.704
What about his record?
Nothing on it

10:03.737 --> 10:05.372
except for his debt
to Cash-Line Direct.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.374
At first glance,
he looked like a Boy Scout.

10:07.407 --> 10:08.608
But he's not?

10:15.115 --> 10:16.216
Oh, that is beautiful.

10:16.249 --> 10:18.385
Not what I was expecting.
What?

10:18.418 --> 10:21.054
From a guy
who also uses a corkboard?

10:21.088 --> 10:23.223
Tobias, is that

10:23.256 --> 10:25.058
the Sky

10:25.092 --> 10:28.195
Oh, McGee, you-you got
a little drool there.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.797
Whoa.

10:32.332 --> 10:33.433
Security footage

10:33.466 --> 10:36.236
from the Oxtail Grill
in D.C. last month.

10:36.269 --> 10:39.072
That is Commander Willis.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.709
Ooh.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.410
I ID'd the guy

10:43.443 --> 10:45.713
he's fighting with
as another Navy commander.

10:45.746 --> 10:46.980
Sean Evans.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.415
It got pretty heated.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.050
Did you talk to Evans?
No.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.785
He's stationed
on the USS Hoover.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.086
That's in port in Norfolk.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.822
Yeah, but without my FBI creds,

10:54.855 --> 10:56.323
I couldn't get access to board.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.291
Should've had Gibbs
pull a string.
I tried.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.861
And he said no?
He didn't say anything.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.796
He's been avoiding me.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.197
He didn't want me on this case.

11:04.231 --> 11:05.799
Didn't show up to this briefing.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.367
Till I saw him today,

11:07.400 --> 11:09.136
he hadn't called in weeks.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.904
He may feel bad
for ratting you out.

11:10.938 --> 11:11.805
Why would he feel bad?

11:11.839 --> 11:13.240
Look at me.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.441
I'm over it.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.176
I'm thriving.

11:16.209 --> 11:19.079
Plus, he did the right thing.

11:19.112 --> 11:21.715
He made sure
that justice

11:21.749 --> 11:23.383
was served.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.919
So why would he be dodging me?

11:27.220 --> 11:29.089
Maybe you three could do
a little investigating.

11:29.122 --> 11:32.125
Oh, no.
Oh, hell no.
We don't investigate Gibbs.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.331
Oh, hold on.

11:39.499 --> 11:41.935
Gibbs.

11:41.969 --> 11:43.904
Anything?

11:43.937 --> 11:45.372
Gabriel Hicks,

11:45.405 --> 11:46.740
a man about town.

11:46.774 --> 11:48.241
I tracked quite a few movements
this week,

11:48.275 --> 11:51.211
but they didn't
add up to much.

11:51.244 --> 11:53.180
We just need
to be patient.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.447
Oh, yeah. Patience.

11:54.481 --> 11:57.317
Got it.
Real good at that.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.352
Hey, some good news.

11:59.386 --> 12:02.255
I'm making headway
with Jessica Shaeffer.

12:02.289 --> 12:04.257
As long as she's his lawyer,
she's not giving us a thing.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.293
Well, not knowingly,

12:06.326 --> 12:08.461
but people slip up
when they get comfortable.

12:08.495 --> 12:09.930
Yeah, well, I know you.

12:09.963 --> 12:12.099
You're friends.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.301
You're not working
her hard enough.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.870
Look, sooner or later,
we will find the evidence

12:16.904 --> 12:18.371
to put Hicks away for good.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.207
Later's not gonna work.
Why

12:20.240 --> 12:22.976
Fornell.

12:23.010 --> 12:25.478
I can't stand looking at him.

12:28.548 --> 12:32.820
It's like I'm lying
right to his face.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.487
Wait, he still doesn't know
he was right?

12:34.521 --> 12:36.890
You haven't told him
that Hicks is guilty?

12:36.924 --> 12:39.126
I don't want him knowing
until we arrest Hicks.

12:39.159 --> 12:41.528
Don't try to change
my mind on this, Jack.

12:41.561 --> 12:42.796
I'm not.
I got to protect him

12:42.830 --> 12:44.231
from himself.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.232
You're right.

12:45.265 --> 12:48.368
I am?
Yeah.

12:48.401 --> 12:51.504
Fornell lost everything for what
we all thought was justice.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.306
But if he knew the truth,

12:53.340 --> 12:56.109
who knows how far he'd go
to bring Hicks down?

12:58.611 --> 13:00.914
I get why you didn't tell him.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.883
And you still think I should.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.889
Yeah, Palmer.

13:08.922 --> 13:11.391
I'll be right down.

13:11.424 --> 13:15.162
My neighbor quit his job
to become a beekeeper

13:15.195 --> 13:18.999
and said that bees
can read his emotions.

13:19.032 --> 13:22.602
He only gets stung when
he's upset or distracted.

13:22.635 --> 13:26.073
I-Isn't it amazing
how connected we all are?

13:26.106 --> 13:28.441
There's even a bond
between human and honeybee.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.343
Why are we talking bees?

13:30.377 --> 13:34.014
I read an online profile
for Commander Willis here.

13:34.047 --> 13:37.184
It said that he dabbled
in beekeeping.

13:39.219 --> 13:41.421
It is a reach, I know.

13:41.454 --> 13:43.490
It-It-It's important for me
to speak with the dead,

13:43.523 --> 13:46.259
but I don't have nearly
as many historical references

13:46.293 --> 13:47.995
to draw from as Dr. Mallard.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.296
So you reach.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.597
Own it.

13:50.630 --> 13:53.566
Well, yeah.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.003
I'll just do that then.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.871
I'll own the reach.

13:57.905 --> 14:00.440
Thank you, Jethro.

14:00.473 --> 14:01.942
Own it faster.
Right.

14:01.975 --> 14:04.511
Uh, moving on.
Uh, the cause of death

14:04.544 --> 14:07.114
was, as suspected, the single
gunshot wound to the head.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.348
Bullet?
A .380,

14:08.381 --> 14:09.649
recovered and
currently with Abby.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.618
She also has
all of those rags

14:11.651 --> 14:13.053
that were stuffed in
beside the body.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.355
Oh, and the drum itself,

14:15.388 --> 14:19.326
which happened to be holding
more than just Commander Willis.

14:23.163 --> 14:24.464
Acid.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.133
It's a base, actually.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.601
When I was unpacking the body,
I saw that his feet

14:28.635 --> 14:30.971
must've been sitting in it
at the bottom of the drum.

14:31.004 --> 14:33.406
How much?
Less than a gallon.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.075
Abby identified it
as sodium hydroxide,

14:35.108 --> 14:36.143
more commonly known as...

14:36.176 --> 14:37.544
Lye.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.913
Dissolving a body.

14:39.947 --> 14:42.615
Good way to get rid of evidence.
Yeah.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.617
Except such
a small amount of lye

14:44.651 --> 14:46.653
never would've gotten
the whole job done,

14:46.686 --> 14:47.587
which, of course,

14:47.620 --> 14:50.958
begs the question...

14:50.991 --> 14:54.627
Commander...

14:54.661 --> 14:57.230
what was your
killer thinking?

15:00.667 --> 15:02.569
EVANS: I knew he was missing,
but you're telling me

15:02.602 --> 15:05.005
somebody killed him?

15:05.038 --> 15:07.340
Willis is dead?
BISHOP: Yes.

15:07.374 --> 15:11.144
How did you know
Commander Willis?

15:11.178 --> 15:13.213
We went to the academy together.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.348
He was as close to a brother
as I've got.

15:20.187 --> 15:21.621
:
Come on.

15:23.290 --> 15:24.557
Yeah, okay.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.426
Turn it off.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.495
What were you fighting about?

15:28.528 --> 15:32.265
Money.

15:32.299 --> 15:33.566
His mom was sick.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.635
It was a rare kind of cancer.

15:35.668 --> 15:38.938
He wanted her to have the best
care, but he couldn't afford it.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.678
I loaned him $8,000.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.647
It was a lot of money.
I needed it back.

15:47.680 --> 15:51.051
When he said he didn't have it,
I got angry and...

15:51.084 --> 15:53.720
said some things
I shouldn't have.

15:53.753 --> 15:56.356
A week ago today, can you
account for your whereabouts?

15:56.389 --> 15:59.292
Look, I can see
where your heads are at.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.361
But I never
would have killed Willis.

16:01.394 --> 16:04.264
He was my friend.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.966
Besides, he paid me back
three weeks ago.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.207
And then she said,
"I love you, too."

16:14.241 --> 16:17.177
And then Bert the Hippo, he gave
the bunny a great big hug

16:17.210 --> 16:19.046
and he promised
that, that they would

16:19.079 --> 16:21.448
wear matching collars
from that day forward.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.649
The end.

16:22.682 --> 16:25.385
Good night, Johnny.
Good night, Morgan.

16:26.653 --> 16:27.620
What's all this?

16:27.654 --> 16:30.190
It's my bedtime story

16:30.223 --> 16:31.724
for the twins' video anthology.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.660
Clay, I've got you down
for chapter 22.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.595
How do you find the time
to put all this together?

16:35.628 --> 16:37.230
ABBY:
That is a good question.

16:37.264 --> 16:38.565
McGee, since
the twins were born,

16:38.598 --> 16:39.766
you haven't even missed a step
at work.

16:39.799 --> 16:40.833
So, what do you got, Abbs?

16:40.867 --> 16:43.636
See how he just dove
right back into work there?

16:43.670 --> 16:45.205
Abbs, you told us
to get our butts down here.

16:45.238 --> 16:46.773
Um, well, I'm still
analyzing the rags

16:46.806 --> 16:49.476
that were found in the drum
with Commander Willis' body,

16:49.509 --> 16:51.544
but at first glance,
it looks like they were used

16:51.578 --> 16:53.080
to clean up the location
where he was shot.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.414
And what about the bullet?

16:54.447 --> 16:56.616
That's why I wanted
your butts down here.

16:56.649 --> 16:58.618
So, I ran ballistics.

16:58.651 --> 17:03.123
The weapon used to shoot
Commander Willis was a .380.

17:03.156 --> 17:05.058
REEVES:
Was it in the system?
ABBY: No.

17:05.092 --> 17:07.660
But two bullets with the
same striations were.

17:07.694 --> 17:08.728
McGEE: Two other
people were killed

17:08.761 --> 17:10.463
with the same gun
in the same way.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.599
Yeah. Execution style.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.301
And both within the last year.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.269
Are the cases related?
No.

17:16.303 --> 17:19.106
The only link is that they
were both murders-for-hire

17:19.139 --> 17:21.641
carried out by some
unidentified hit man,

17:21.674 --> 17:23.276
which means...

17:23.310 --> 17:25.812
Someone put out a professional
hit on Commander Willis.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.490
Hey, yo. Look who I found
in the lobby.

17:37.524 --> 17:38.825
FORNELL:
Leave the FBI,

17:38.858 --> 17:40.627
it's Lord of the Flies
down there.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.495
Security got out
the pitchforks

17:42.529 --> 17:43.563
when I tried to
come up unescorted.

17:43.596 --> 17:44.764
McGee, what do we know?

17:44.797 --> 17:47.567
Well, Commander Willis was shot
by an unidentified hit man

17:47.600 --> 17:49.769
who committed two other
unrelated murders.

17:50.670 --> 17:51.871
BISHOP:
Can you confirm that?

17:51.904 --> 17:52.739
Gibbs.

17:55.242 --> 17:56.543
Fancy meeting you here.

17:58.211 --> 17:59.679
Where you going?
GIBBS:
I got to get a thing.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.114
I think I'm catching
something.

18:01.148 --> 18:02.449
Sounds important.

18:02.482 --> 18:03.550
BISHOP: Yeah, okay,
thank you for your help.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.353
Got something.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.888
I just confirmed
that six months ago,

18:08.921 --> 18:12.559
Commander Willis served on the
jury of a high-profile trial.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.827
The People v.
Albert Hathaway.

18:14.861 --> 18:17.397
The Ponzi King?
Bernie Madoff wannabe.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.631
TORRES: That thing was in
the news for, like, months.

18:18.665 --> 18:20.233
Hathaway was
an investment advisor

18:20.267 --> 18:22.402
who cheated his clients
out of millions of dollars.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.704
And Commander Willis was on
the jury that convicted him?

18:24.737 --> 18:26.539
He was foreman.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.708
So, we're thinking Hathaway
pulled off the hit from prison?

18:31.178 --> 18:33.446
JESSICA:
He has got plenty
of connections,

18:33.480 --> 18:34.614
and, from what I heard,

18:34.647 --> 18:36.583
Hathaway's a real
piece of work.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.619
Thanks. Smartest
person in the room.

18:39.652 --> 18:40.687
according to him.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.623
And what about the jury?

18:43.656 --> 18:45.858
What about 'em?
I don't know.
Did you hear anything?

18:45.892 --> 18:48.228
They were sequestered for months
on a trial

18:48.261 --> 18:50.397
where everyone knew the guy was
guilty from day one.

18:50.430 --> 18:51.531
That's frustrating.

18:51.564 --> 18:53.766
For sure.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.703
What?
Jack, what are
we doing here?

18:56.736 --> 18:58.671
These questions you're asking--

18:58.705 --> 19:00.940
it isn't insider lawyer
information.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.775
You could have looked it up
online.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.213
Okay.

19:06.246 --> 19:09.216
I need to talk to you
about Gabriel Hicks.

19:09.249 --> 19:12.385
You know I can't discuss him.

19:12.419 --> 19:14.387
He's still my client.
I know that.

19:14.421 --> 19:17.757
You were never a hundred percent
sold on Hicks' innocence.

19:17.790 --> 19:18.858
I get that.

19:18.891 --> 19:19.959
Jess, it's more than that.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.528
Listen, Jack.

19:21.561 --> 19:23.696
He was exonerated,
and rightfully so.

19:23.730 --> 19:25.732
I just need you to hear me out.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.434
I can't discuss him.

19:27.467 --> 19:28.368
Here you go.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.403
Thank you.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.210
I should go.

19:37.244 --> 19:38.745
I really am behind on work.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.847
No. No, no. Stay.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.549
Stay.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.817
You're right.
I won't bring him up again.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.553
Please.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.355
You're the only friend I have

19:48.388 --> 19:50.557
who will watch
reality TV with me,

19:50.590 --> 19:52.859
so I'd be really bored.

19:54.427 --> 19:57.264
You have my eggs.

19:57.297 --> 19:59.466
Oh, yeah. I'm not
into scrambled, no.
I don't want this.

20:02.669 --> 20:03.936
I didn't do it.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.305
You didn't do
what, exactly?

20:05.338 --> 20:06.473
Any of it.

20:06.506 --> 20:07.807
Any of what?

20:07.840 --> 20:10.410
Mishandling of peoples'
finances.

20:10.443 --> 20:13.646
My executive assistant had
access to all my passwords;

20:13.680 --> 20:15.748
she's the one
that you want...
Mr. Hathaway,

20:15.782 --> 20:16.849
that's not why we're here.

20:16.883 --> 20:19.619
Do you know him?

20:20.320 --> 20:21.788
No, I don't believe I do.

20:21.821 --> 20:24.557
BISHOP:
His name is
Commander James Willis,

20:24.591 --> 20:27.427
and he was foreman on the jury
that put you in here.

20:27.460 --> 20:31.331
I've compartmentalized
large portions of the trial.

20:31.364 --> 20:34.901
Truly, the emotional trauma
was debilitating.

20:34.934 --> 20:37.804
I guess my not knowing
his exact face

20:37.837 --> 20:40.407
would be something akin to PTSD.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.808
Not even close, man.

20:47.447 --> 20:48.881
HATHAWAY:
The same man?

20:48.915 --> 20:50.750
The foreman?

20:50.783 --> 20:52.852
Yep.
You trying to
pin this on me?

20:52.885 --> 20:54.721
I've been in here
for six months.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.524
They took me directly
from sentencing to booking.

20:58.591 --> 20:59.726
Albert.

21:01.027 --> 21:02.362
Do you know any hit men?

21:02.395 --> 21:03.996
This is ridiculous.

21:04.030 --> 21:07.900
Maybe you do know one,
but, you know, PTSD...

21:09.402 --> 21:10.570
...made you forget.

21:10.603 --> 21:11.671
Hmm.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.072
I don't know anyone like that.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.842
Well, Mr. Hathaway,
when we listen

21:15.875 --> 21:17.610
to all the recordings
of the phone calls

21:17.644 --> 21:19.412
you've made in here,
you better hope

21:19.446 --> 21:21.581
we don't find you even talking
about the weather

21:21.614 --> 21:23.783
with someone who connects
back to this case.

21:30.823 --> 21:31.858
Hey, Abbs.

21:31.891 --> 21:33.426
Got your text.
What's going on?

21:37.029 --> 21:38.097
REEVES:
Hi, there, mate.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.599
Have a seat.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.868
Okay.

21:41.901 --> 21:45.738
McGee, we've been
thinking more

21:45.772 --> 21:48.508
about how you've been managing

21:48.541 --> 21:51.511
to stay on top of everything.

21:51.544 --> 21:52.812
REEVES:
This...

21:52.845 --> 21:54.881
is one of four coffee cups

21:54.914 --> 21:56.649
I pulled from your trash...

21:56.683 --> 21:59.852
today.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.120
But you weren't drinking coffee
out of these coffee cups,

22:01.153 --> 22:02.522
were you, McGee?

22:02.555 --> 22:03.790
I tested

22:03.823 --> 22:05.792
the remnants from the cup.

22:05.825 --> 22:08.761
Do you have anything
you'd like to say?

22:08.795 --> 22:11.097
Sure.
I've been drinking Caf-POW!

22:11.130 --> 22:12.865
That's great work.

22:12.899 --> 22:14.934
You know, the first step
of recovery is admitting

22:14.967 --> 22:16.669
you have a problem.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.405
What? I don't have a problem.

22:18.438 --> 22:20.473
Abby drinks this stuff
all day long.

22:20.507 --> 22:22.975
I have been building up
my tolerance for years.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.877
I need the extra caffeine
to stay awake, okay?

22:24.911 --> 22:26.746
There's not enough hours
during the day.

22:26.779 --> 22:29.148
I feel guilty when work
keeps me away from the twins,

22:29.181 --> 22:31.551
and I feel guilty when the twins
keep me away from work.

22:31.584 --> 22:36.656
McGee, you're like this giant
hamster on a giant guilt wheel.

22:36.689 --> 22:37.657
You need

22:37.690 --> 22:39.659
to get off
the wheel.

22:39.692 --> 22:42.128
Okay, I'll stop drinking it.

22:42.161 --> 22:44.163
Seriously?
Yeah, seriously.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.998
This tough love thing
totally works with me.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.934
It's, uh... it's very effective.

22:47.967 --> 22:49.135
So, what do you guys say?

22:49.168 --> 22:51.404
We stand up,
talk about the case?

22:51.438 --> 22:53.806
Yeah.

22:53.840 --> 22:55.107
Adjourned.

22:57.910 --> 23:01.648
So, the rags that were stuffed
in the drum with the body...

23:01.681 --> 23:03.450
They were used to clean
the murder location.

23:03.483 --> 23:05.818
Yes. The killer left no DNA,

23:05.852 --> 23:07.820
and it is
Commander Willis' blood.

23:07.854 --> 23:10.089
But the rags themselves,
they're made

23:10.122 --> 23:12.525
of a new, high-end microfiber

23:12.559 --> 23:15.094
that's sold wholesale
to various companies.

23:15.127 --> 23:16.963
How many?
A lot.

23:16.996 --> 23:20.800
But I was able to identify
a cleaning solution

23:20.833 --> 23:22.935
called Swiftex.

23:22.969 --> 23:25.972
It's specifically made to
dissolve biological matter.

23:26.005 --> 23:28.708
I cross-referenced
the rags with the cleaner,

23:28.741 --> 23:33.112
and I got a hit on a company
in D.C. that buys both in bulk.

23:33.145 --> 23:35.014
Crime Scene
Tru-Clean.

23:35.047 --> 23:38.685
Yeah, it's like a professional
crime scene cleaning company.

23:38.718 --> 23:41.020
That's a good job, Abbs.
Text me the address.

23:41.053 --> 23:42.154
Oh, uh, McGee,

23:42.188 --> 23:43.990
Bishop and Torres
are already there.

23:44.023 --> 23:47.960
I really just called you
down here for the intervention.

23:47.994 --> 23:50.530
Oh.

23:50.563 --> 23:53.800
WOMAN: The night your
sailor went missing,

23:53.833 --> 23:56.469
two of my workers
didn't show up for work.

23:56.503 --> 23:58.037
The Barrett brothers.

23:58.070 --> 23:59.572
What happened?
Next morning,

23:59.606 --> 24:00.907
I was doing inventory.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.742
Three liters of lye
were missing,

24:02.775 --> 24:06.913
along with four bottles
of Swiftex and my floor buffer.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.915
I confronted
'em about it.

24:08.948 --> 24:11.951
Michael and Joey Barrett
are their names.

24:11.984 --> 24:14.721
They stole the stuff.
Sure did.

24:14.754 --> 24:16.723
I fired 'em on the spot, and
if I don't see my floor buffer

24:16.756 --> 24:19.258
by tomorrow, they're gonna be
in a world of hurt.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.893
Do you happen to have
their home addresses?

24:20.927 --> 24:24.063
No, they move around so
much, I can't keep track.

24:24.096 --> 24:26.065
But if you want to find 'em,
I do know

24:26.098 --> 24:27.800
that they eat almost every meal

24:27.834 --> 24:29.769
at that disgusting place
over on Sixth.

24:29.802 --> 24:32.505
The raw food place?
No.

24:32.539 --> 24:35.007
The place that serves only pizza
and French fries.

24:35.041 --> 24:37.844
Can you imagine eating that crap
for every meal?

24:40.713 --> 24:43.516
BISHOP:
Mmm, my mouth is watering.

24:43.550 --> 24:44.984
Have you ever eaten there?

24:45.017 --> 24:47.153
No.
Mm.

24:47.186 --> 24:49.922
Well, it must be good

24:49.956 --> 24:52.559
if people are willing
to wait in line like that.

24:52.592 --> 24:54.994
A lot of times,

24:55.027 --> 24:56.863
people are idiots.

24:58.164 --> 24:59.832
Which one's which?

24:59.866 --> 25:00.833
Uh, this one is Michael,

25:00.867 --> 25:02.168
and...

25:02.201 --> 25:03.770
that's Brother Joey.

25:03.803 --> 25:06.072
TORRES: Are you guys seeing
what I'm doing out here?

25:06.105 --> 25:07.306
I'm killing it!

25:07.339 --> 25:09.742
BISHOP:
Mm, get over yourself, Nick.

25:09.776 --> 25:11.978
You're waiting in a line.
No, dude,

25:12.011 --> 25:14.747
I'm making all these people
believe that...

25:14.781 --> 25:17.584
a guy
with this body fat percentage

25:17.617 --> 25:19.619
would actually eat here.

25:19.652 --> 25:21.120
I'm fitting right in.
Oh, this feels good.

25:21.153 --> 25:22.088
This feels really good.

25:22.121 --> 25:24.691
You went to the briefing
at Fornell's place?

25:24.724 --> 25:25.858
Yeah. Why?

25:25.892 --> 25:27.059
How'd he seem?

25:27.093 --> 25:29.028
FORNELL:
I'm peachy.

25:29.061 --> 25:30.763
Thanks for asking.

25:30.797 --> 25:31.898
Tobias?

25:31.931 --> 25:34.901
Café table by the restaurant.

25:38.971 --> 25:40.640
What are you doing here?

25:40.673 --> 25:44.644
Wait, you're
surprised that I'm up to speed?

25:44.677 --> 25:49.148
I still have some contacts at
NCIS who will answer my calls.

25:49.181 --> 25:50.683
So,

25:50.717 --> 25:53.019
let's catch us
a couple of Barrett brothers.

25:53.052 --> 25:55.054
GIBBS:
You can't arrest anybody.

25:55.087 --> 25:58.024
I am well aware.
Hell, you can't even carry
a weapon.

25:58.057 --> 25:59.626
As a civilian, I can.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.027
Are you carrying
a weapon?

26:01.060 --> 26:04.731
I may have a little something
going on.

26:04.764 --> 26:06.999
How did you even get
on this frequency?
I've been working

26:07.033 --> 26:09.135
with you people for 15 years.
You think I don't know

26:09.168 --> 26:10.369
what frequency you're on?

26:10.402 --> 26:12.138
And don't tell me...

26:12.171 --> 26:14.641
Targets at your six,
Torres, heading north.

26:14.674 --> 26:15.975
Torres, move.

26:16.008 --> 26:17.076
JOEY: You always get
your order to go.

26:17.109 --> 26:18.044
MICHAEL:
What are you talking...?

26:18.077 --> 26:19.278
Tobias, stay.

26:19.311 --> 26:21.047
I'm not your poodle, Gibbs.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.849
JOEY:
I want to order pizza.

26:22.882 --> 26:24.150
Hey, Barretts.
No, I'm not...

26:24.183 --> 26:25.384
Don't move. NCIS.

26:25.417 --> 26:26.285
Go, go, go!

26:29.188 --> 26:31.023
Fornell!
I got him!

26:32.391 --> 26:33.993
Look out.

26:42.802 --> 26:44.871
Freeze!

26:58.685 --> 27:00.152
Not bad.

27:13.365 --> 27:15.902
Mr. Fornell.

27:15.935 --> 27:18.671
Word traveled quickly about
your creative takedown.

27:18.705 --> 27:20.773
Well done.
Thank you.

27:20.807 --> 27:22.775
You know,
that's all I wanted from Gibbs.

27:22.809 --> 27:23.776
A little appreciation.

27:23.810 --> 27:26.045
Yeah, I heard
he took your Taser.
Smashed it

27:26.078 --> 27:27.747
on the ground
like an animal.

27:27.780 --> 27:29.916
Whatever's going on
with him, uh,

27:29.949 --> 27:31.918
I'm starting
to take it personally.

27:31.951 --> 27:34.053
MICHAEL:
It's not an operation.
Basically...

27:34.086 --> 27:35.287
Director, you have any idea?

27:35.321 --> 27:38.124
Couples therapy is not
in my job description.

27:38.157 --> 27:40.993
JOEY:
Michael was approached about
starting a business on the side.

27:41.027 --> 27:43.896
Damn it, Joey,
it's not a business.
Okay, fine!

27:43.930 --> 27:44.697
Doesn't Gibbs have a rule

27:44.731 --> 27:46.332
against putting suspects
together?

27:46.365 --> 27:47.867
He put 'em together
because he knew

27:47.900 --> 27:49.135
they'd do all the work
for him.

27:49.168 --> 27:51.738
Doesn't even have
to ask them a question.

27:51.771 --> 27:53.873
It's like I want to be mad
at him, but I just can't.

27:53.906 --> 27:56.208
We were hired by a hit man
to get rid of a body

27:56.242 --> 27:58.210
and clean up the mess.
Is that better?

27:58.244 --> 27:59.912
Just so you know,
this is the first time

27:59.946 --> 28:00.980
we ever worked for a hit man.

28:01.013 --> 28:02.048
No, you-you
didn't work for him.

28:02.081 --> 28:03.215
I let you help.

28:03.249 --> 28:04.316
He only talked to me.

28:04.350 --> 28:06.052
He hired me.
We only said yes

28:06.085 --> 28:07.053
for the money.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.856
Did he ask you that?

28:09.889 --> 28:12.925
You said if we cooperate,
he'll go easy on us. Look,

28:12.959 --> 28:14.927
the hit man shot
the Navy guy

28:14.961 --> 28:16.028
in an abandoned factory
behind this hospice.

28:16.062 --> 28:17.764
Enough, okay?

28:17.797 --> 28:18.865
We cleaned it up.
I told you to let me

28:18.898 --> 28:19.866
do the talking.
We were gonna

28:19.899 --> 28:20.599
dissolve the body

28:20.632 --> 28:22.068
in the barrel,
but we got fired

28:22.101 --> 28:23.435
before we could steal
enough lye.

28:23.469 --> 28:25.905
Damn it, Joey!
Could you let me talk, please?

28:27.473 --> 28:30.810
The hit man said we were
supposed to dump, not dissolve.

28:30.843 --> 28:32.879
We dumped the body in
the Potomac instead. That's it.

28:32.912 --> 28:35.214
The end.
State police

28:35.247 --> 28:36.949
pulled over a stolen vehicle.

28:36.983 --> 28:39.118
Found the body
in the back.

28:40.787 --> 28:44.090
Wait, someone stole
the van that I stole?

28:44.123 --> 28:46.092
You didn't dump the body?

28:46.125 --> 28:48.094
You said there was gonna
be a second cleanup.

28:48.127 --> 28:50.529
I was gonna dump
both bodies at once.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.965
You had one job.

28:52.999 --> 28:54.867
Dump the body.

28:54.901 --> 28:56.869
I was going to.

28:56.903 --> 28:58.004
What's second cleanup?

28:58.037 --> 29:00.539
It was supposed to happen
right after the first one,

29:00.572 --> 29:01.974
but it's been a week.

29:02.008 --> 29:03.910
Call still hasn't come.

29:03.943 --> 29:06.813
What call?
Hit man is putting
us up in a motel.

29:06.846 --> 29:08.815
It's the Stargazer
over on Dixon.

29:08.848 --> 29:11.350
One of us is supposed to stay
there all the time to pick up

29:11.383 --> 29:13.820
the landline when he calls
with the cleanup location.

29:13.853 --> 29:16.222
Which is what you should have
done, like I told you to.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.424
Oh, my God, you're not
the boss of me, Michael.

29:22.862 --> 29:24.230
Wow.

29:24.263 --> 29:27.233
They deal with dead bodies

29:27.266 --> 29:29.568
and eat nothing but junk,

29:29.601 --> 29:32.939
yet they live
like my Aunt Judy.

29:32.972 --> 29:34.340
They love to clean.
Hmm.

29:38.911 --> 29:40.412
Bathroom's clear.

29:40.446 --> 29:41.981
Took you guys long enough.

29:42.014 --> 29:44.016
You got to be kidding me.
Hey,

29:44.050 --> 29:45.918
Director Vance gave me the nod
to be here.

29:45.952 --> 29:48.520
Great.
It is great.

29:48.554 --> 29:50.857
It's great that I'm here.
It's great that you're here.

29:50.890 --> 29:52.358
It's great that I get
to sit here and watch you

29:52.391 --> 29:55.027
squirm for reasons
nobody knows but you.

29:55.061 --> 29:56.195
The whole damn thing

29:56.228 --> 29:58.330
is great.

29:58.364 --> 29:59.866
Uh, I'm gonna...

29:59.899 --> 30:01.968
go get some pizza and fries.

30:02.001 --> 30:03.202
I mean, we have
to sit here

30:03.235 --> 30:05.237
and wait for the hit man
to call, right?

30:05.271 --> 30:07.039
Who knows
how long we'll be here?

30:08.640 --> 30:11.343
Look, Gibbs...

30:11.377 --> 30:14.380
I can't talk right now.

30:14.413 --> 30:15.982
You with Fornell?

30:16.015 --> 30:17.016
Yeah.

30:17.049 --> 30:18.517
Then I'll do the talking.

30:18.550 --> 30:20.920
Hicks is still inside
of his apartment.

30:20.953 --> 30:23.389
No activity for the past hour.

30:23.422 --> 30:24.556
That's it?

30:24.590 --> 30:26.959
Hey, I'll call you back.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.896
Jessica...

30:29.929 --> 30:32.098
I was coming to drop
some papers off to my client,

30:32.131 --> 30:33.399
and I saw your car.

30:38.137 --> 30:39.471
Hey.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.007
Hey, I can explain.
You know what,

30:41.040 --> 30:44.010
forget it.
There's nothing you can say.

30:44.043 --> 30:46.512
Hey. Hey, Jessica. Jessica.

30:46.545 --> 30:49.048
Jessica, I tried to
tell you at breakfast.

30:49.081 --> 30:50.449
I thought we were friends.

30:50.482 --> 30:52.284
This whole thing
has been one long con

30:52.318 --> 30:53.986
to get something on Hicks.
Listen to me,

30:54.020 --> 30:55.988
I am your friend,
and I'm worried about you.

30:56.022 --> 30:58.357
Hicks is a psychopath.
He's dangerous.

30:58.390 --> 31:00.993
I have to go.
Hey, he is
ambidextrous.

31:01.027 --> 31:02.995
Do you get it?
You think he's innocent

31:03.029 --> 31:05.631
because he's right-handed, but
I saw him at the batting cage.

31:05.664 --> 31:09.301
I saw him crush ball after ball
left-handed.

31:09.335 --> 31:10.937
You were following him then,
too?

31:10.970 --> 31:12.538
Please, just think
about what I'm telling you.

31:12.571 --> 31:14.340
Jack, go home.

31:14.373 --> 31:16.142
Before I decide
to go public

31:16.175 --> 31:19.145
with NCIS's harassment
of an innocent civilian.

31:27.119 --> 31:30.089
(coughing,
blowing nose)

31:38.264 --> 31:42.168
Watched phone never rings.

31:45.471 --> 31:48.040
Want to play charades?

31:48.074 --> 31:50.542
You go first.

31:53.279 --> 31:55.514
Okay, I've got one.

31:57.116 --> 32:00.119
Sounds like "brass mole."

32:00.152 --> 32:02.088
What do you
want from me?

32:02.121 --> 32:05.424
I want you to act
like your normal awful self,

32:05.457 --> 32:08.160
not this awful self.
Let it go.

32:08.194 --> 32:09.161
Why are you avoiding me?

32:09.195 --> 32:10.162
I'm not avoiding you.
You did the right thing

32:10.196 --> 32:11.297
in the courtroom.

32:11.330 --> 32:12.098
I know I did.
I'm over it.

32:12.131 --> 32:13.499
How many times
do I have to say that?

32:13.532 --> 32:15.167
You're over it, but you
keep bringing it up.

32:15.201 --> 32:17.169
Because you're avoiding me.
I'm not avoiding you.

32:17.203 --> 32:20.039
Gibbs, this is me.

32:22.008 --> 32:24.610
This is me.

32:24.643 --> 32:27.513
You do this
to other people,

32:27.546 --> 32:29.248
not to me.

32:32.051 --> 32:34.020
You were right.

32:34.053 --> 32:35.221
Okay?

32:35.254 --> 32:37.123
You were right.

32:37.156 --> 32:40.359
I told the truth about you
in the courtroom.

32:40.392 --> 32:42.061
I sunk your career.

32:42.094 --> 32:45.064
We've established that.
Afterwards,

32:45.097 --> 32:47.433
I found out
I did it for nothing.

32:47.466 --> 32:49.035
You were right.

32:49.068 --> 32:50.569
Hicks is guilty.

32:52.438 --> 32:54.673
He should have been
locked up all along.

32:56.442 --> 32:59.278
You sure?
Yeah.

32:59.311 --> 33:02.148
How could you not tell me that?

33:03.649 --> 33:07.053
Never mind.
We'll duke that out later.

33:07.086 --> 33:09.455
Right now
we've got to get Hicks.

33:09.488 --> 33:12.024
Tell me what you have
on him so far.

33:12.058 --> 33:14.160
Sloane and I--
we got it handled.

33:15.161 --> 33:17.596
You're shutting me out?

33:17.629 --> 33:20.099
I'm trying to protect you.
From what?

33:21.700 --> 33:24.303
I've got nothing left
to lose, Gibbs.

33:24.336 --> 33:27.005
The job, yeah,
I'm over that.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.076
But the way Emily looked at me

33:30.109 --> 33:32.244
when she found out
about all this...

33:32.278 --> 33:36.182
Tobias, I'm gonna
make this right.

33:36.215 --> 33:38.050
I'm gonna put this guy away.

33:38.084 --> 33:40.286
But you won't trust me
to keep my head.

33:45.191 --> 33:48.127
That's all right.

33:49.595 --> 33:52.431
I wouldn't know how
to trust you now either.

33:58.537 --> 34:02.174
Uh, is he
coming back?

34:02.208 --> 34:04.576
No.

34:04.610 --> 34:07.079
Okay.

34:17.723 --> 34:21.227
(man speaking indistinctly
over phone)

34:21.260 --> 34:22.261
30 minutes.

34:22.294 --> 34:24.730
We'll handle it.

34:26.332 --> 34:27.566
Got a location.

34:27.599 --> 34:28.867
Cleanup starts
in 30 minutes.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.136
The hit already happen?

34:30.169 --> 34:32.404
No.

34:32.438 --> 34:34.440
It's about to.

34:41.613 --> 34:42.648
Got it.

34:42.681 --> 34:45.151
Hey, and, Bishop,
watch your six.

34:45.184 --> 34:47.486
Location: 4236 Barker Avenue.

34:47.519 --> 34:49.655
All right, how much
time do we have?

34:49.688 --> 34:51.190
Well, cleanup happens in 30.

34:51.223 --> 34:52.658
So the hit can happen
any minute.

34:52.691 --> 34:55.494
Okay, 4236 Barker
is a residence.

34:55.527 --> 34:58.197
It's a house belonging
to Patrice Jansen.

34:58.230 --> 34:59.531
Well, I'm running
a search through our files.

34:59.565 --> 35:00.866
Her name sounds familiar.
You know it?

35:00.899 --> 35:03.235
No. Any reason why
she'd be targeted?

35:03.269 --> 35:05.571
Her passport was scanned
at Dulles 20 minutes ago.

35:05.604 --> 35:08.207
Looks like she's returning
from a week overseas.

35:09.475 --> 35:10.709
McGEE:
Oh, the reason

35:10.742 --> 35:12.544
Jansen's name sounded familiar
is 'cause

35:12.578 --> 35:14.180
I saw it on the juror list.

35:14.213 --> 35:16.582
She was on the jury for
the trial of Albert Hathaway,

35:16.615 --> 35:18.184
same as Commander Willis.
You think this Ponzi guy

35:18.217 --> 35:19.818
is killing the whole jury
that put him away?

35:19.851 --> 35:20.886
Get Gibbs.

35:20.919 --> 35:22.721
Hi, you've reached Patrice.

35:22.754 --> 35:24.423
Sorry I missed your call.

35:24.456 --> 35:25.891
Jansen's phone's going
to voice mail.

35:25.924 --> 35:28.860
Gibbs is not picking up, either.

35:53.385 --> 35:55.621
*

36:48.440 --> 36:50.609
You recognize him?

36:50.642 --> 36:51.677
No.

37:03.855 --> 37:06.625
NCIS.

37:09.395 --> 37:11.763
PATRICE:
Someone paid to have me killed?

37:11.797 --> 37:15.301
Why?
We think it was connected
to a jury you served on.

37:15.334 --> 37:16.702
The Hathaway trial?

37:16.735 --> 37:20.872
There's another victim,
also on the jury.

37:21.973 --> 37:23.642
Commander Willis?

37:23.675 --> 37:26.912
Uh, what do you mean "victim"?

37:26.945 --> 37:29.615
Are you saying James is dead?

37:29.648 --> 37:32.284
Yes.

37:35.020 --> 37:36.755
Oh, my God.

37:38.590 --> 37:39.758
I'm sorry.

37:39.791 --> 37:41.460
:
I can't...

37:41.493 --> 37:43.362
I can't do
this right now.

37:45.030 --> 37:46.998
Is that a bee

37:47.032 --> 37:48.800
on your necklace?

37:51.036 --> 37:54.306
Jury was sequestered for months.

37:56.742 --> 37:58.810
You got close
to Commander Willis.

38:02.080 --> 38:04.416
I-I knew he was married.

38:04.450 --> 38:07.386
I-I... I knew it was wrong,

38:07.419 --> 38:09.821
but I fell in love with him.

38:10.956 --> 38:13.425
I... I loved him.

38:14.860 --> 38:17.796
Uh, Gibbs?

38:22.668 --> 38:25.103
McGee ran the plates on
the hit man's vehicle.

38:25.136 --> 38:26.772
Mm

38:26.805 --> 38:28.840
Name is Dominic Malecki,

38:28.874 --> 38:31.777
and up until now, he managed
to keep his record clean.

38:31.810 --> 38:34.380
And we still can't
connect him to Hathaway.

38:42.988 --> 38:45.524
I don't understand.

38:45.557 --> 38:48.594
Why am I in this room?

38:48.627 --> 38:51.129
I thought that you had
more information

38:51.162 --> 38:53.031
on who killed
my husband.

39:02.941 --> 39:06.077
I think that you're the one
with the information.

39:06.111 --> 39:08.714
I told you everything I know.

39:11.717 --> 39:14.553
Phone calls and
a money transfer.

39:14.586 --> 39:17.856
They tied you to
a gun for hire,
Dominic Malecki.

39:17.889 --> 39:19.991
You put a hit out
on your husband.

39:20.025 --> 39:21.527
TORRES:
And Patrice Jansen,

39:21.560 --> 39:22.928
the woman that...

39:22.961 --> 39:24.730
he had an affair with.

39:31.903 --> 39:35.607
He spent our entire life savings

39:35.641 --> 39:38.410
on experimental treatments
for his mother.

39:39.911 --> 39:42.781
She was beyond... help.

39:42.814 --> 39:46.618
It was everything that we had.

39:46.652 --> 39:49.488
You knew that he was cheating,
and that was the last straw.

39:49.521 --> 39:52.023
I deserve...

39:52.057 --> 39:54.793
his life insurance.

39:56.828 --> 39:58.997
He owed me that.

40:04.603 --> 40:05.771
FORNELL:
Gibbs?

40:05.804 --> 40:08.073
Uh, I'm in your office.

40:16.247 --> 40:18.484
Side door was open.

40:19.718 --> 40:21.920
You mean
after you picked the lock?

40:21.953 --> 40:23.689
You got to get better security.

40:23.722 --> 40:25.924
Yeah, I'll get right on that.

40:30.261 --> 40:33.665
Everything Sloane
and I have on Hicks.

40:33.699 --> 40:36.568
It's still not enough,

40:36.602 --> 40:38.770
but it's a start.

40:38.804 --> 40:43.008
So... you ruin me,

40:43.041 --> 40:44.843
you punish me for ruining me,

40:44.876 --> 40:48.614
and now you're asking me
to do this with you?

40:48.647 --> 40:52.484
Yeah, mm-hmm. Yeah, I am.

40:53.752 --> 40:55.921
I'm in.

41:01.092 --> 41:02.928
Hey, Tobias...

41:04.930 --> 41:07.599
Don't say it.

41:07.633 --> 41:11.803
I don't like it
when you break your own rules.

41:15.040 --> 41:16.642
What about Sloane?
Yeah.

41:16.675 --> 41:18.243
She down with me
being part of this?

41:18.276 --> 41:20.245
Uh-huh, she's
on her way in.

41:20.278 --> 41:23.214
Just stopping by
to see a friend first.

41:37.028 --> 41:38.196
Hey.

41:38.229 --> 41:39.898
Oh, thanks for coming.

41:39.931 --> 41:42.033
Of course. Should
we go somewhere?

41:42.067 --> 41:44.135
Uh, I only have a minute.
I'm meeting with a client.

41:44.169 --> 41:46.672
Hicks?
No.

41:48.840 --> 41:51.577
I couldn't shake it.

41:52.678 --> 41:55.180
What you told me about him
at the batting cage.

41:55.213 --> 41:58.049
I did some digging.
And you found something?

41:58.083 --> 42:01.820
I told Hicks
to secure new counsel.

42:01.853 --> 42:04.756
Why

42:04.790 --> 42:06.825
I can't say.
I'm not his lawyer anymore,

42:06.858 --> 42:08.994
but everything I know
is still privileged.

42:09.027 --> 42:11.029
Jessica, please...
Jack, all I can say is,

42:11.062 --> 42:12.731
don't stop digging.

42:14.933 --> 42:16.602
Got it. Thank you. Thank you.

42:16.635 --> 42:20.005
Okay. I'll call you.

42:25.076 --> 42:26.177
Gibbs?

42:26.211 --> 42:28.046
Jack, I'm here with Fornell.

42:28.079 --> 42:29.881
When you gonna get here?
Oh!

42:35.787 --> 42:38.123
Jack?

42:39.157 --> 42:40.892
Jack?

42:44.029 --> 42:45.997
Jack?!
