00:19.793 --> 00:20.996
Oh, sorry.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.767
- This yours?
- Yeah, thank you.

00:23.792 --> 00:26.976
Come on, Norma.

00:27.001 --> 00:28.943
- Whoo!
- Aww!

00:33.143 --> 00:35.726
- Okay, baby, come on.
- Oh!

00:38.685 --> 00:39.987
Jo, take it!

00:40.012 --> 00:41.287
Got it!

00:41.292 --> 00:43.871
Oh!

00:43.896 --> 00:45.092
You know, if I could put the ball

00:45.116 --> 00:47.459
- in the ocean, I'd be happy.
- Oh, Jesus.

00:48.496 --> 00:50.238
Doesn't look too swollen.

00:50.263 --> 00:53.167
Okay, so... so any plans for Christmas?

00:53.192 --> 00:54.635
Oh, nice.

00:54.660 --> 00:56.365
So I have... the whole family comes over

00:56.390 --> 00:58.700
I cook all the time. And, like...

00:58.725 --> 01:01.416
- Are you guys here every week?
- Yeah.

01:01.441 --> 01:03.071
Have a good night.

01:03.096 --> 01:05.078
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

01:08.138 --> 01:11.103
So then the firemen lifted
me high, high, high, high

01:11.128 --> 01:12.750
up into the sky.

01:12.775 --> 01:15.650
- High.
- High up into the sky.

01:15.675 --> 01:18.378
And they carried me down the stairs,

01:18.692 --> 01:21.115
and in that moment, I knew
everything was gonna be okay.

01:21.420 --> 01:24.461
And now it's four years later,
and it's your birthday.

01:24.968 --> 01:27.123
The doctor came and pulled me out.

01:27.152 --> 01:28.839
No, the doctor didn't.

01:28.864 --> 01:31.314
We pulled you out in the living room.

01:31.339 --> 01:33.321
That's what I was trying
to tell her, too, buddy.

01:33.346 --> 01:34.857
I want to go see my birthday.

01:34.882 --> 01:35.992
You want to bury a birthday wish?

01:36.016 --> 01:37.776
Let's go and see the
Birthday Fairy, come on.

01:37.801 --> 01:40.560
Bury it deep, deep, deep,
deep, deep, deep, deep.

01:40.585 --> 01:41.585
Pour some water on it.

01:42.357 --> 01:44.162
Make a wish to the Birthday Fairy.

01:46.089 --> 01:48.707
Okay, now it's time

01:48.732 --> 01:51.671
to go to sleep so your
present will come.

01:51.696 --> 01:53.642
- Okay.
- Okay.

02:09.676 --> 02:11.500
Bad? That was good.

02:11.525 --> 02:14.286
I could be one of those people who
translates from English to Spanish.

02:14.523 --> 02:15.905
Say birthday.

02:16.005 --> 02:17.871
Cumpleaños.

02:19.316 --> 02:20.944
You think we're fucking him
up raising him like this?

02:20.968 --> 02:22.601
- Be honest.
- He's gonna be fine.

02:22.626 --> 02:23.944
Don't just say he's
fine and gloss over it.

02:23.968 --> 02:26.568
- How do you really feel?
- I'm not glossing over it. I'm serious.

02:27.067 --> 02:28.907
You want to know how I
know he's gonna be fine?

02:29.020 --> 02:30.402
What?

02:30.502 --> 02:33.165
'Cause eventually we're
gonna end up together.

02:33.265 --> 02:36.409
Nelson, she's gonna leave
me for this rich athlete,

02:36.509 --> 02:38.310
and it's gonna be like musical chairs.

02:38.662 --> 02:40.694
And it's, like, eventually
just gonna end up

02:40.719 --> 02:42.568
with you and me.

02:43.826 --> 02:45.115
I'm gonna be fat when I'm 60.

02:45.284 --> 02:46.484
I'll be fatter.

02:46.761 --> 02:48.103
You? Look at this.

02:48.203 --> 02:50.362
- You could never be fat.
- Like you are?

02:50.709 --> 02:52.959
- You didn't answer the question.
- What question?

02:52.984 --> 02:55.795
Just... whenever he says
good-bye to you and he cries,

02:56.367 --> 02:57.654
or he says good-bye to me,

02:57.679 --> 03:00.270
and I just feel like all
of that's gonna add up,

03:00.295 --> 03:02.185
and it's not good for him.

03:02.925 --> 03:04.013
He's gonna be fine.

03:05.904 --> 03:07.126
How can you say that?

03:07.971 --> 03:09.122
'Cause I know.

03:17.083 --> 03:18.385
- Rafi.
- What?

03:18.410 --> 03:19.911
What are you doing?

03:19.936 --> 03:21.447
No, no, and no.

03:21.883 --> 03:23.602
What are you doing?

03:23.627 --> 03:25.262
What?

03:25.287 --> 03:27.750
- You can't do that.
- It was accidental.

03:27.850 --> 03:29.352
- "Accidental"?
- Sorry.

03:29.377 --> 03:30.719
No, we have boundaries,

03:30.969 --> 03:33.151
and you just stepped over the boundary.

03:33.176 --> 03:35.804
"Boundaries." Pillow wall.

03:35.829 --> 03:37.487
Pillow wall, cement wall.

03:37.512 --> 03:39.414
All right, cement wall.

03:41.466 --> 03:43.128
I'll be back tomorrow.

03:43.228 --> 03:44.849
I'll come watch Larry for your shift.

03:44.874 --> 03:46.809
Hey, thanks for letting
me play basketball.

Zoom.

05:40.397 --> 05:42.739
Stopped at the gate.

05:43.130 --> 05:44.645
How about syrup, you want some syrup?

05:45.715 --> 05:47.676
It's your birthday. You
can do whatever you want.

05:47.701 --> 05:50.132
Yum. Now... now you have to
drink some water, though.

05:51.306 --> 05:52.438
Hmm?

_

Here, have a piece.

06:18.065 --> 06:19.573
What could you possibly be doing?

06:21.284 --> 06:22.784
Fuck.

06:24.277 --> 06:25.574
You want to come with me to work?

06:25.598 --> 06:27.180
No.

06:27.411 --> 06:29.674
Hi, what are you doing?

06:31.366 --> 06:32.565
Hi!

06:32.590 --> 06:35.204
Hi, happy birthday!
Look who's here, it's Princess Nelly!

06:35.229 --> 06:36.811
- Hi.
- Hello.

06:36.836 --> 06:39.386
Oh, gosh. God, I have my period.

06:39.977 --> 06:41.319
I only have regular, though.

06:41.344 --> 06:42.358
- Oh.
- Usually I use super-plus.

06:42.382 --> 06:44.013
Do you think I can put
two up there at once?

06:44.037 --> 06:45.147
Sure.

06:45.172 --> 06:47.185
You probably use only,
like, super, super tiny.

06:47.210 --> 06:48.970
Yeah, I have to split
them in half sometimes.

06:48.995 --> 06:50.497
Where is Rafi, anyway?

06:50.522 --> 06:51.743
He's getting Larry a...

06:51.768 --> 06:53.450
Super-secret birthday gift.

06:53.475 --> 06:55.658
- He's so sweet.
- He is very sweet.

06:55.955 --> 06:57.970
Um, okay, well, I just need you

06:57.995 --> 06:59.774
to give him a nap before
he goes to the party,

06:59.798 --> 07:01.329
- or else it'll be a disaster.
- Okay.

07:01.354 --> 07:03.478
- It's kind of a process, okay?
- Yeah, no... yep.

07:03.503 --> 07:04.961
You got to tell him a story,
but you got to make it up.

07:04.985 --> 07:06.440
It can't be something
that he already knows.

07:06.464 --> 07:08.103
So, like, a story...
a magical story about an animal

07:08.127 --> 07:09.505
or a garbage truck
that acts like an animal.

07:09.529 --> 07:11.632
An animal. Yeah, no, I...
Yeah, Rafi and I...

07:11.864 --> 07:13.606
But if that doesn't work,
sing him a story.

07:13.631 --> 07:15.311
Do you want to just
try one out real quick?

07:16.268 --> 07:18.478
- Like an audition?
- No, no, no. No!

07:18.503 --> 07:20.440
I just mean, like, you know,
come in there with gusto.

07:20.464 --> 07:21.573
Like, you know what you're...

07:21.597 --> 07:23.612
even if you no idea and
you're making it up as you go,

07:23.636 --> 07:24.815
just, like, show him

07:24.840 --> 07:26.582
that you know
what you're talking about.

08:09.047 --> 08:11.109
That's a whole life right there.

08:13.732 --> 08:15.382
You know, he was so handsome.

08:15.407 --> 08:17.538
It's weird, I always heard
he was a punk or something.

08:17.563 --> 08:18.869
You were too little to know,

08:18.894 --> 08:20.483

Tomorrow is a mystery. Today is a gift.

08:33.078 --> 08:34.855
That's why they call it the present.

08:35.482 --> 08:36.865
That is just crazy.

08:36.890 --> 08:39.553
I know.

08:39.813 --> 08:41.673
He looked like Desi Arnaz.

08:41.698 --> 08:42.854
Oh, God.

08:42.879 --> 08:44.579
- No, forget Milo. Come on.
- No, he did,

- Whatever.
- Mm.

09:02.443 --> 09:03.768

09:03.793 --> 09:05.960

09:05.985 --> 09:08.201
- Mm-hmm.
- That's disgusting.

09:08.226 --> 09:10.369
I would think it'd be disgusting, too.

09:10.394 --> 09:13.099
- But it wasn't disgusting.
- Like, what did that kiss taste like?

09:13.123 --> 09:14.637

- Mm-mm.

09:22.105 --> 09:23.604

09:23.628 --> 09:25.061
Give me, like, the tinglies.

09:25.086 --> 09:27.949
Yeah, well, you should "unfeel" it.

09:27.974 --> 09:29.701
You do realize that he's engaged?

09:29.726 --> 09:31.136
No, I feel bad about that, I really do.

09:31.160 --> 09:32.982
- Like, Nelson?
- Aww.

09:33.097 --> 09:34.596
- Think about Nelson.
- That's fucked up.

09:34.620 --> 09:35.774

09:35.799 --> 09:37.230
You know what this is about, actually?

09:37.254 --> 09:38.603
- What is it about?
- This is about family.

09:38.627 --> 09:40.103
- Mm-hmm.
- It's about family.

09:40.128 --> 09:42.398
Yeah, staying together
for the kid is a unique concept

09:42.423 --> 09:45.256

in the scary movie

09:52.543 --> 09:54.326
who goes down to the basement,

09:54.351 --> 09:56.293
and she's like, "Hello?

09:56.508 --> 09:58.210
- Is anyone there?"
- No.

09:58.235 --> 10:00.195
Instead of just getting
the fuck out of the house.

10:00.220 --> 10:02.162
No.

10:02.187 --> 10:04.490
Love you.

10:07.138 --> 10:08.228
Hi, sir.

10:08.253 --> 10:10.587
That sounds like
a upper respiratory infection.

10:10.612 --> 10:12.462
Maybe an antibiotic would do some good.

10:12.487 --> 10:13.776
What are you, a nurse or something?

10:13.800 --> 10:15.245
- Say what?
- You a nurse?

10:15.270 --> 10:16.323
- Am I a nurse?
- Yeah.

10:16.348 --> 10:18.771
- Do I look like a nurse?
- You don't look like a doctor.

10:23.401 --> 10:24.854
What does a doctor look like?

10:24.879 --> 10:26.741
- I don't know. White coat...
- Mm-hmm.

10:26.766 --> 10:29.221
- You'd need a stethoscope.
- So it's the gold chains?

10:29.246 --> 10:30.738
That's why you don't think I'm a doctor?

10:30.762 --> 10:33.225
Yeah, I mean, you... you look
more like an undercover cop

10:33.250 --> 10:35.706
trying to bust up a drug deal.

10:35.891 --> 10:37.433
- That's what I look like?
- Yeah.

10:37.698 --> 10:39.200
Well, you could pass for one.

10:39.300 --> 10:41.400
You really opened up my eyes today.

10:41.425 --> 10:42.690
This was enlightening. Thank you.

10:42.714 --> 10:43.759
You're welcome.

10:44.176 --> 10:46.799
Well, I am gonna be a doctor.

10:46.824 --> 10:48.726
I'm gonna be the President
of the United States.

10:48.751 --> 10:49.823
All right.

10:50.796 --> 10:52.459
- You have a good one.
- You too.

10:52.484 --> 10:55.010
- Stay handsome, Mr. President.
- I can always try.

10:55.035 --> 10:57.499
Mama!

10:57.524 --> 10:59.503
Larry, please, come on.

♪ There was the kangaroo ♪

11:00.935 --> 11:04.787

11:04.812 --> 11:07.085
No, we can't play, okay?
We have to put you to bed.

11:07.110 --> 11:09.213
Come on, we're gonna...

11:09.532 --> 11:11.415
All right, let's...
let's do a story, yeah?

11:12.219 --> 11:14.836
There once was a frog

11:15.552 --> 11:17.180
who lived in a pond.

11:17.761 --> 11:19.750
Larry was the frog's name,

11:19.775 --> 11:22.316
and he was green.

11:23.569 --> 11:25.712
Um, not doing it for you.

11:25.737 --> 11:26.949
Okay.

11:30.313 --> 11:31.597
Can you see my belly?

11:32.016 --> 11:33.190
You see my belly?

11:33.506 --> 11:34.613
Can you listen to it?

11:34.853 --> 11:36.715
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

11:40.472 --> 11:41.682
Yeah?

11:42.277 --> 11:43.433
So...

11:43.458 --> 11:45.682
... once there was a very...

11:46.505 --> 11:49.688
lucky little tadpole.

11:50.023 --> 11:52.118
When the tadpole met the egg,

11:52.143 --> 11:55.736
it transformed into a bean.

11:56.005 --> 11:58.393
A big bean or a little one?

11:58.961 --> 12:00.984
It was a little bean at first.

12:01.200 --> 12:04.184
Yeah, it's like this big,
like, right now.

12:04.209 --> 12:05.270
Yeah, like that.

12:05.611 --> 12:07.051
And you know where he lives?

12:08.205 --> 12:09.205
Right in here.

12:12.784 --> 12:14.806
But can you sleep for me now?

12:15.333 --> 12:16.447
I want Mama.

12:16.935 --> 12:18.194
All right, you know what?

12:18.218 --> 12:19.787
Fine, you win.

12:20.738 --> 12:23.081
Here, just... there you go.

12:29.515 --> 12:30.923
Hello?

12:50.416 --> 12:52.549
No, it just... it flew into the window.

12:52.574 --> 12:54.525
Yeah, I think it's breathing.

12:54.817 --> 12:56.150
I don't... what should I do?

12:57.904 --> 12:58.943
Oh, hi, guys.

12:58.968 --> 13:00.587
Hey, I really need to speak to you.

13:00.611 --> 13:02.153
Here, I'll call you back, okay?

13:02.286 --> 13:04.588
This bird just crashed into the window.

13:04.828 --> 13:06.506
Can you get a box
and poke some holes in it,

13:06.530 --> 13:07.851
and maybe it'll recover?

13:07.876 --> 13:09.236
Can I please speak to you, though?

13:12.499 --> 13:13.773
I'm gonna go get this box.

13:13.798 --> 13:14.905
I'll be right back.

13:15.578 --> 13:16.613
Hey, birthday boy.

13:16.922 --> 13:18.000
Are you the birthday boy?

13:19.235 --> 13:21.243
Why did the bird fly in the window?

13:22.282 --> 13:24.999
Because she thought it was clear skies.

13:26.077 --> 13:28.335
Hey, is this the right
sized box, you think?

13:29.468 --> 13:31.210
He's, like, shaking.

13:32.265 --> 13:34.408
Okay, let me just poke some holes in it.

13:34.433 --> 13:35.503
Just...

13:36.750 --> 13:39.133
- Hey, did you nap?
- No.

13:39.233 --> 13:41.877
Larry, it's like the one day
you needed to nap.

13:42.557 --> 13:44.213
Hey, Bridge, so...

13:45.225 --> 13:46.650
I really hope it was a mistake.

13:49.640 --> 13:50.803
CVS called and told me

13:50.828 --> 13:52.975
that my prescription
for Oxycodone was ready,

13:53.000 --> 13:55.398
but I didn't order the prescription.

13:57.815 --> 13:59.037
Okay.

13:59.337 --> 14:00.478
Fuck.

14:00.578 --> 14:02.521
He's such a jerk.

14:03.037 --> 14:04.539
It's okay. It's... he's relapsing.

14:04.564 --> 14:06.686
It happens. Fucking welcome to life.

14:07.325 --> 14:08.499
And I'm pregnant.

14:13.420 --> 14:14.420
Wow.

14:15.685 --> 14:17.547
That's... Um, how far along are you?

14:17.654 --> 14:18.860
Six weeks.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.435
- Does Rafi know?
- Yep.

14:21.073 --> 14:22.236
Was he upset?

14:22.261 --> 14:24.071
No, he was really happy.

14:28.034 --> 14:29.268
That's great news.

14:30.248 --> 14:31.951
It is.

14:32.586 --> 14:34.493
Same thing happened...
he was really happy

14:34.518 --> 14:36.477
when I told him I was pregnant,
and then he fell off the wagon.

14:36.501 --> 14:38.218
It's... it's a lot,

14:38.243 --> 14:40.148
and he'll just have
to get sober again, right?

14:40.173 --> 14:42.524
Or he's not gonna be able to see Larry

14:42.549 --> 14:44.966
or your baby ever again, so it'll happen.

14:45.548 --> 14:46.845
All that matters is that you take care

14:46.869 --> 14:48.501
of you and the baby,
and I will help you.

14:48.526 --> 14:49.602
- Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

14:49.627 --> 14:50.666
- Thank you.
- That's all that matters.

14:50.690 --> 14:51.892
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

14:51.917 --> 14:55.901
Hey, at least we're not
the bird in this box

14:56.046 --> 14:57.669
fighting for its life.

14:58.722 --> 15:00.341
I guess we are kind of fighting
for our lives, huh?

15:29.599 --> 15:31.181
Rafi, you okay in there?

15:31.976 --> 15:34.359
Y-yeah, Tutu, I-I'll be right out.

15:34.912 --> 15:37.855
Jesus, I mean, how long does
it take to use a bathroom?

15:38.423 --> 15:39.998
I hate when people poop in my house.

15:40.023 --> 15:43.007
Yeah, well, I hope he uses
a little Renuzit in there.

15:46.360 --> 15:48.059
Well, that's why,
you know, he knows, like,

15:48.083 --> 15:49.468
really what he's doing down there.

15:49.493 --> 15:50.537
- Rafi.
- Yeah?

15:50.562 --> 15:51.880
Would you call Bridge for me, please?

15:51.904 --> 15:55.137
- I lost my phone.
- Yeah, I got my phone.

15:55.577 --> 15:56.855
Could you call Bridge?

15:58.487 --> 16:00.270
I'm gonna set up
the karaoke machine, okay?

16:00.295 --> 16:01.607
Okay, all right.

16:11.040 --> 16:13.704
Check, check, check.

16:13.729 --> 16:15.787
Larry, it's your birthday!

16:15.800 --> 16:18.109
In my heart, you got first place!

16:18.134 --> 16:20.172
I love you to the moon and back!

16:20.197 --> 16:21.236
Who is that?

16:21.261 --> 16:23.584
When I say "Larry," y'all say "Bird"!

16:23.609 --> 16:24.805
Larry! Bird.

16:24.810 --> 16:27.441
Larry! Bird. Larry! Bird.

16:27.466 --> 16:30.918
And the crowd goes crazy.

16:35.788 --> 16:38.091
Thank y'all for coming, I appreciate it.

16:39.673 --> 16:41.375
- Happy birthday!
- Hi.

16:41.550 --> 16:44.253
Welcome to the party.
Here, I have a balloon for you.

16:44.353 --> 16:46.817
Oh, you brought a present.
You're so sweet.

17:05.816 --> 17:07.278
Hey. What's up, man?

17:07.303 --> 17:09.165
Hey, welcome to the party, guys.

17:09.190 --> 17:11.453
Go right on in.

17:11.478 --> 17:13.810
Hey, Rafi, you okay?

17:14.544 --> 17:16.807
Yeah, I'm just out here
greeting people for the party.

17:16.832 --> 17:18.133
Hmm.

Hey, hey, we know.

19:44.169 --> 19:45.471
What do you know?

19:45.633 --> 19:47.175
CVS called.

19:47.275 --> 19:48.782
They rang about the Oxycodone.

19:49.496 --> 19:50.538
We know.

19:50.858 --> 19:53.093
- I know you're on drugs.
- I'm not on drugs, Bridgette.

19:53.118 --> 19:54.900
- Don't fucking lie to me.
- I'm not fucking lying to you!

19:54.924 --> 19:56.712
- Look at me, I'm not on drugs!
- Bridgey?

19:58.285 --> 19:59.408

and they can take you,
and we can drive you tonight.

20:09.061 --> 20:10.843
Bridge, that shit doesn't work for me.

20:10.943 --> 20:12.501
How do you know? You never tried it.

20:12.666 --> 20:13.782
It doesn't work.

20:15.028 --> 20:16.094
What about Larry, huh?

20:16.790 --> 20:18.532
It is Larry's fucking birthday,

20:18.912 --> 20:20.341
and you're here, up here,

20:20.915 --> 20:22.522
wearing a cat sweater on pills.

20:22.547 --> 20:23.615
Why do you always have to do that?

20:23.639 --> 20:24.920
So you're not... what...
what's the alternative?

20:24.944 --> 20:27.300
Why do you always have to put
Larry in my face, Bridgette?

20:27.325 --> 20:28.941
- Fuck.
- Nelson's pregnant.

20:29.506 --> 20:31.482
I can't leave Nelson,
I can't leave the baby,

20:31.507 --> 20:33.689
and I can't leave Larry for six weeks.

20:33.850 --> 20:35.723
- You're already gone.
- I can't leave Larry for six weeks.

20:35.747 --> 20:37.239
I'm not gone! I'm right here!

20:37.264 --> 20:38.340
- I'm right here!
- Listen...

20:38.364 --> 20:39.874
No, you're not. You're fucking gone.

20:39.899 --> 20:41.501
Look at me, I'm fucking trying!

20:41.526 --> 20:43.348
And you fucking keep pushing me!

20:43.373 --> 20:45.039
Rafi, we just want
to help you, okay?

20:45.063 --> 20:47.246
- What's gonna help you?
- Meetings, baby.

20:47.271 --> 20:48.318
Then let's do meetings.

20:48.343 --> 20:49.717
- We can do...
- No, meetings don't work for him.

20:49.741 --> 20:52.191
He wants to go to meetings.
Let's help him.

20:52.216 --> 20:53.835
Oh, meetings, meetings.
You always say that.

20:53.859 --> 20:55.882
No, you go to a meeting
for a week, right?

20:55.907 --> 20:58.423
You act like you're fucking king of AA,
and then you stop going.

20:58.447 --> 20:59.989
Why do you got to say shit like that?

21:01.867 --> 21:03.343
- Oh.
- Hey, buddy.

21:03.368 --> 21:04.640
Look who it is.

21:05.734 --> 21:06.867
What you got?

21:14.659 --> 21:15.916
Where did you get that?

21:15.940 --> 21:17.140
From Tutu.

21:17.165 --> 21:18.508
You know this used to be mine?

21:19.439 --> 21:21.301
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

21:21.549 --> 21:23.692
Hey, buddy.

21:23.717 --> 21:25.299
You want to sing a song?

21:25.874 --> 21:27.496
You need to go downstairs, okay?

21:27.674 --> 21:28.936
Can you go back downstairs,

21:28.961 --> 21:30.838
and we'll come play with you soon?

21:30.863 --> 21:32.725
- In a second.
- Bye-bye.

21:32.750 --> 21:33.776
Bye.

21:38.768 --> 21:39.948
I'll drive you right now.

21:40.449 --> 21:41.649
I'll throw away all the pills.

21:42.286 --> 21:44.269
I just lost focus for a little second...

21:44.294 --> 21:47.438
- You're gonna choose drugs over him.
- I'm not choosing drugs over Larry.

21:49.780 --> 21:52.904
I'm having the weirdest feeling...

21:55.143 --> 21:57.010
... like I've... I've been here...

21:58.150 --> 22:00.213
exactly here before.

22:00.696 --> 22:02.344
I haven't been here before.

22:03.400 --> 22:04.446
Welcome.

22:06.645 --> 22:07.767
I promise, babe.

22:08.632 --> 22:09.789
I'm good.

22:51.854 --> 22:53.288
Skye is here.

22:54.137 --> 22:56.374
Where's my friend, Chase?

22:57.079 --> 22:58.661
Where could he be?

22:58.832 --> 23:02.256
Who's gonna fly in my rocket ship?

23:02.281 --> 23:04.465
With Skye?

23:05.310 --> 23:07.733
Oh!

23:07.833 --> 23:08.989
There he is!

23:08.994 --> 23:11.377
Chase, ta-da!

23:35.190 --> 23:36.932
You did? That's huge.

23:36.957 --> 23:38.940
- Took the MCATs.
- MCATs.

23:38.965 --> 23:40.827
- Mm-hmm.
- That's what they're called.

23:40.852 --> 23:42.434
Did they call it MCAT?

23:42.459 --> 23:44.772
You know, gynecology, or...

23:44.797 --> 23:47.578
Yeah.

23:56.931 --> 23:58.258
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:03.504 --> 24:05.366
I'm excited for this.

24:05.391 --> 24:06.459
Go ahead.

24:10.296 --> 24:11.496
Too much butter.

24:11.521 --> 24:12.677
- Mm-mm.
- No?

24:12.702 --> 24:13.768
It's good.

24:14.912 --> 24:16.214
- Yeah.
- Maybe a little.

24:16.314 --> 24:18.096
- Yeah.
- Still eat it, though.

24:18.196 --> 24:19.279
Good.

24:20.279 --> 24:21.309
Larry's asleep.

24:21.766 --> 24:23.247
Good. We tired him out.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.325
And Rafi's gone.

24:27.207 --> 24:29.214
- What?
- Rafi's gone.

24:30.531 --> 24:31.964
Gone where, honey?

24:35.937 --> 24:37.837
He's, uh, relapsed.

24:38.671 --> 24:39.892
I know.

24:39.917 --> 24:41.204
I saw at the party.

24:41.229 --> 24:43.232
I didn't want to upset you.

24:46.310 --> 24:48.087
I'm just kind of scared, you know?

24:48.112 --> 24:49.499
- Yeah.
- Um...

24:50.942 --> 24:54.379
Just... like, I feel like
I'm living someone else's life.

24:55.519 --> 24:56.644
I know.

24:59.565 --> 25:00.940
Just... do you want some?

25:12.645 --> 25:14.723
I'm impressed with myself right here.

25:16.923 --> 25:20.008
It's not the way
it was supposed to work out.

25:27.208 --> 25:28.208
Well...

25:29.401 --> 25:31.864
I guess, you know, we could go.

25:31.889 --> 25:33.763
Now would be the time to go.

25:33.788 --> 25:34.826
Go where?

25:34.851 --> 25:37.177
We could go to New York
like we were supposed to go

25:37.202 --> 25:39.279
four years ago, but we stayed here.

25:40.256 --> 25:41.405
What is it you want?

25:41.430 --> 25:43.207
I just want to be a fucking person.

25:43.232 --> 25:44.473
Mm.

25:47.145 --> 25:49.559
World... just a person in the world.

25:55.872 --> 25:57.234
I want to find her.

25:59.997 --> 26:01.122
What?

26:04.963 --> 26:06.731
- What are you talking about?
- Open it.

26:13.453 --> 26:16.038
Mom, what is this?

26:17.979 --> 26:20.198
Travis was not my first child.

26:22.383 --> 26:25.062
I was 16 years old when I got pregnant.

26:26.378 --> 26:28.265
The father's name was Milo,

26:29.065 --> 26:30.299
and I never saw him again.

26:31.194 --> 26:33.144
My parents were so ashamed,

26:33.797 --> 26:36.175
so embarrassed,
they shipped me off to Ireland,

26:36.589 --> 26:38.971
told everyone I had mononucleosis.

26:38.996 --> 26:40.363
They told me the right thing to do

26:40.388 --> 26:42.411
was to give the baby up for adoption.

26:42.677 --> 26:43.942
I never got to hold her.

26:45.211 --> 26:47.000
I just got a glance to look at her

26:47.025 --> 26:48.563
as they whisked her out of the room.

26:50.377 --> 26:52.679
- You have another daughter.
- I do.

26:53.415 --> 26:54.719
You have a big sister.

26:58.672 --> 26:59.681
Wow.

27:00.709 --> 27:03.132
We have a-a person out there.

27:03.232 --> 27:04.529
Yep.

27:04.554 --> 27:06.409
- Yes, we do.
- And I love Guinness.

27:06.434 --> 27:08.654
- Well, it's genetic maybe.
- It's genetic.

27:08.679 --> 27:09.795
Yeah.

27:09.820 --> 27:11.383
We got the Irish blood,

27:11.408 --> 27:13.591
and we got a sister for you in Ireland.

27:13.855 --> 27:15.637
Cranberries is my favorite band.

27:15.662 --> 27:17.644
- Mm, mm.
- Pretty much.

27:17.929 --> 27:20.112
- Mom.
- Bono?

27:20.137 --> 27:22.640
- Bono... yeah, he's cool.
- U2.

27:22.665 --> 27:25.449
That's not a bad place
to grow up, I bet.

27:28.021 --> 27:29.764
That was the bird, I think.

27:29.789 --> 27:32.789
That was the bird! It's... it's alive!

27:33.923 --> 27:35.558
Good thing I left the door open.

27:35.583 --> 27:38.572
Well, always leave a door open, Bridgey,

27:38.597 --> 27:40.452
'cause you never know
when you have to escape.

27:44.606 --> 27:46.124
Where do you want to escape to?

28:16.498 --> 28:17.566
Supahsmaht.
