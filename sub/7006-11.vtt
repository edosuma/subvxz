WEBVTT

00:02.569 --> 00:06.232
Well, that finishes our segment on home
safety. l hope you learned something.

00:06.306 --> 00:10.572
l know l have.
Next time, we'll use a fireproof sign.

00:12.078 --> 00:14.239
l'll call our insurance adjuster.

00:14.314 --> 00:17.442
- lt's on the speed dial, number eight.
- Oh, really?

00:18.184 --> 00:20.744
Well, it's time to dip
into the old mail bag, Al.

00:20.854 --> 00:25.154
That's right. And our first letter
is from ''Perplexed in Petoskey.''

00:25.225 --> 00:29.321
Ah, Petoskey. They have that beautiful
tire parade and pickle festival.

00:29.396 --> 00:32.159
Gherkins and whitewalls. Love that.

00:32.265 --> 00:37.430
OK. ''l tried to install
some dowels in an oak shelf unit.

00:37.537 --> 00:40.904
They expanded and wouldn't fit
in the holes. What can l do?''

00:40.974 --> 00:43.340
Most people don't know,
but you can shrink a dowel

00:43.443 --> 00:45.536
if you put it in the microwave
for two minutes.

00:45.612 --> 00:48.547
That's true. And then just
sprinkle a little cheddar on top,

00:48.615 --> 00:51.345
you'll have a nice
oak-aroni and cheese.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:02.328 --> 01:06.492
<i>You want to keep a lookout
for Al's new book, Cooking with Lumber.</i>

01:08.668 --> 01:12.365
OK. Uh, this is
from ''Flummoxed in Fenwick.''

01:12.439 --> 01:17.274
Fenwick. That's a great place.
They have the National Earmuff Museum.

01:17.343 --> 01:21.404
lt's open late July through early August
because otherwise they're wearing them.

01:23.316 --> 01:27.218
''l'm getting my driver's license
this year. l know a lot about cars.

01:27.287 --> 01:31.849
But l'd like to learn even more.
l think if my parents bought me my own,

01:31.958 --> 01:36.452
it would be a great educational
experience. What do you think?''

01:36.529 --> 01:39.987
Well, l think, uh, cars are expensive,
especially for a teenager.

01:40.066 --> 01:43.365
- So, l'd have to say...
- Yes! Yes!

01:45.672 --> 01:49.369
<i>...Brad, if you want a car,
you get a job. All right, pal?</i>

02:41.294 --> 02:44.127
l might not have much experience, sir,
but l'm a fast learner.

02:44.197 --> 02:46.256
And if you hire me,
l know you won't regret it.

02:46.332 --> 02:48.994
Sorry, kid.
You're not what we're looking for.

02:50.270 --> 02:52.101
[sighs] What was wrong this time?

02:52.172 --> 02:56.006
You just don't have the sophistication
to work at the Wiener Barn.

02:58.311 --> 03:00.472
Working on that job interview?
How's it going?

03:00.547 --> 03:04.313
Ah, it's going all right. lt's just
a part-time job selling wieners.

03:04.417 --> 03:06.078
Wait a minute. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:06.152 --> 03:08.643
You back that wiener wagon
right back up.

03:09.556 --> 03:11.285
There's no such thing as ''just a job.''

03:11.357 --> 03:13.917
Someone's paying you for something,
take it seriously.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.655
Dad, he'd be in charge of relish.

03:18.998 --> 03:22.764
Here's a tip.
Compliment them on their sauerkraut.

03:22.835 --> 03:27.966
Tell them it's right up there with
the kraut burrito at Casa de Bratwurst.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.769
Won't he see right
through me if l kiss up?

03:34.514 --> 03:36.675
[scoffs] Excuse me.

03:36.749 --> 03:40.014
The guy's the manager of a Wiener Barn.

03:41.921 --> 03:43.980
How sharp can the guy be?

03:50.496 --> 03:52.396
Can you help me?

03:52.465 --> 03:56.231
Can anybody really help anybody?

03:57.170 --> 04:00.003
We're all alone. And then we die.

04:02.141 --> 04:04.302
lt's time for my break.

04:06.312 --> 04:10.681
That's unbelievable. l've taken
one ten-minute break in my life.

04:10.783 --> 04:12.512
The doctor put that plaster cast on me

04:12.585 --> 04:15.554
and l was back at work
before the plaster dried.

04:15.655 --> 04:17.418
Just like my dad.

04:17.523 --> 04:20.286
- l'm Rob. l own the place.
- Brad. Nice to meet you.

04:20.360 --> 04:21.656
What can l do for you, Brad?

04:21.728 --> 04:24.219
l'm a little early for my
job interview across the mall,

04:24.297 --> 04:26.197
l thought l'd check out your snowboards.

04:26.266 --> 04:30.532
Snowboarding. That's how
l ended up in my second body cast.

04:30.603 --> 04:33.367
On the up side, l ended up
selling the entire surgical team

04:33.439 --> 04:35.600
a fleet of kayaks.

04:38.878 --> 04:40.903
Excuse me, Brad.

04:40.980 --> 04:43.949
There's a beautiful woman there
looking at a $1 ,500 bicycle.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.644
l love this job.

04:48.588 --> 04:51.079
- Well, hidy-ho, Taylor lad.
- Hey, Wilson.

04:51.157 --> 04:54.024
So, what brings you
to this indoor amalgam of vendors,

04:54.093 --> 04:56.220
colloquially known as ''the mall?''

04:56.296 --> 04:59.197
l'm killing time before my
job interview at the Wiener Barn.

04:59.265 --> 05:00.232
What are you doing?

05:00.333 --> 05:03.962
Well, Brad,
l'm on a quest for a new hobby.

05:04.037 --> 05:08.940
l've narrowed it down
to either channeling Aztec spirits...

05:09.008 --> 05:11.374
...or rollerblading.

05:14.747 --> 05:19.275
Brad, do you know anything
about these skates?

05:19.352 --> 05:22.048
Sure do.
These softer ones are for indoor.

05:22.121 --> 05:24.214
These harder, faster ones
are for outdoor.

05:24.290 --> 05:28.454
The bearings are rated by ABEC numbers
that go from one to 1 2. Most use three.

05:28.528 --> 05:32.692
Well, l don't know, Brad. Maybe
channeling Aztec spirits is a lot safer.

05:32.799 --> 05:36.758
Aren't the Aztecs the ones that cut
the hearts out of people still alive?

05:36.869 --> 05:39.736
[gulps]

05:40.606 --> 05:44.042
l'm gonna go
for those Turbo Roller 2000s.

05:44.110 --> 05:46.169
You know,
they're on sale over at Larson's.

05:46.245 --> 05:50.204
Really? Well, maybe l'll
go over there and take a gander.

05:50.316 --> 05:52.477
- Good luck with that Wiener Barn.
- Thanks.

05:52.552 --> 05:55.487
Oh, by the way, Brad, a little tip.
Compliment the sauerkraut.

05:55.555 --> 05:57.489
They just love that.

05:59.158 --> 06:01.456
So you're also
an expert on rollerblading.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.688
Well, l wouldn't say l'm an expert.

06:03.796 --> 06:06.492
You're doing a good job
driving customers out of my store.

06:06.566 --> 06:08.431
l'm sorry. That was my neighbor Wilson.

06:08.501 --> 06:11.800
Brad, do you know what l do to people
who do what you just did?

06:11.871 --> 06:14.101
Cut out their hearts?

06:14.907 --> 06:17.876
l offer them a job. What do you say
you work for me part-time?

06:17.944 --> 06:20.003
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

06:20.079 --> 06:22.843
lf you're on my payroll,
you'll keep customers in my store.

06:22.915 --> 06:25.247
And that's kind of
what l'm going for here, Brad.

06:25.318 --> 06:28.549
Well, it sounds a lot better
than steaming wieners.

06:30.323 --> 06:34.384
What do you say we go talk salary over
at Java Joe's? You a coffee lover, Brad?

06:34.460 --> 06:37.327
Yeah, and one day,
l hope to be a coffee drinker.

06:42.001 --> 06:44.435
Coffee, anyone?

06:47.440 --> 06:50.375
We don't drink coffee. We're kids.

06:50.443 --> 06:53.378
And the word on the street is,
so are you.

06:55.515 --> 06:58.143
Hey, as of today, l'm a working man.

07:05.057 --> 07:07.958
And a working man
needs his morning coffee.

07:09.695 --> 07:12.858
A little more sugar,
and the working man can fly to work.

07:14.467 --> 07:16.401
Pass me the business section.

07:17.804 --> 07:19.931
Well, there's the working stiff.

07:20.006 --> 07:21.940
Having a good day?
Thanks for the coffee.

07:32.552 --> 07:35.851
l'm not sure you put enough
coffee in the sugar, did you?

07:37.957 --> 07:39.584
You pumped up for your first day?

07:39.659 --> 07:42.127
Yeah. l'm ready
to rack up some big numbers.

07:42.195 --> 07:44.356
- All right.
- Well, l'm out of here.

07:44.430 --> 07:45.658
When you get home tonight,

07:45.731 --> 07:48.461
we're gonna block-sand some
of the panels on the hot rod.

07:48.534 --> 07:50.593
- You got it.
- Good luck, kid.

07:50.670 --> 07:53.935
l'm not a kid anymore.
l'm a working man.

07:55.708 --> 07:57.403
So long, boys.

08:02.014 --> 08:05.040
Dad, could l get some lunch money?

08:09.822 --> 08:11.449
Hi.

08:11.524 --> 08:13.651
l'm looking for some new golf clubs.

08:13.726 --> 08:16.058
[scoffs] Golf?

08:16.128 --> 08:18.688
Now there's a total waste of time.

08:18.798 --> 08:22.131
What, do you wear
those silly clothes too? [laughs]

08:22.201 --> 08:25.864
Actually, sir,
our golf section's right over there.

08:25.938 --> 08:27.906
Our best clubs
are probably our graphite.

08:28.007 --> 08:30.942
But if you want something
a little less expensive, try steel.

08:31.010 --> 08:33.501
See what feels comfortable.
l'll be back.

08:34.313 --> 08:36.474
Nice work, Brad.

08:36.582 --> 08:39.073
l'm gonna help the golf guy.
You haven't taken a break.

08:39.150 --> 08:41.619
Hey, l don't need a break.
l'm trying to make a sale.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.951
You know,
it's kind of what l'm going for here.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.684
You're doing a great job.

08:45.758 --> 08:48.921
You've made more sales
in one day than Holly's made in...

08:55.635 --> 08:58.160
Actually, Holly's never made a sale.

08:59.438 --> 09:03.340
Well, if you don't mind me asking,
why did you hire her?

09:03.409 --> 09:05.502
l've got a good heart.

09:05.578 --> 09:07.307
And she's my sister.

09:09.782 --> 09:13.309
Well, maybe one day she'll finally wake
up and take her job seriously, huh?

09:13.386 --> 09:15.946
l need a two-hour lunch.
l'm getting my tongue pierced.

09:18.324 --> 09:21.350
- Doesn't that hurt?
- Yeah.

09:24.630 --> 09:26.928
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey, Brad.

09:26.999 --> 09:29.832
- How was the first day at the new job?
- Unbelievable!

09:29.902 --> 09:32.632
l took in the highest
first-day gross of any salesman

09:32.705 --> 09:34.730
still living with his parents.

09:34.807 --> 09:36.570
- Ha-ha! That's my boy!
- All right.

09:36.642 --> 09:38.940
- Congratulations.
- And the best part is,

09:39.011 --> 09:42.447
he wants to give me more hours. He wants
me to work an extra two days a week.

09:42.515 --> 09:46.679
Wow! Well, l guess that's OK, as long
as you keep up with your schoolwork.

09:46.786 --> 09:49.482
Don't forget, you've got
a big day coming up in two weeks.

09:49.555 --> 09:52.319
That's right!
We're putting the engine in the hot rod.

09:52.391 --> 09:56.293
Brad is taking his PSAT tests.

09:56.362 --> 09:59.490
Oh, God, how l hated...

10:00.866 --> 10:02.925
...when those tests were over.

10:04.537 --> 10:07.700
- The PSATs are really important.
- Oh, don't worry.

10:07.773 --> 10:10.537
l'm sure Rob'll give me
the afternoon off. He's a great guy.

10:10.643 --> 10:12.611
l'll be back.
l gotta study brochures.

10:12.712 --> 10:15.442
Wait! l thought we were
gonna block-sand the hot rod.

10:15.514 --> 10:18.574
No, l can't do it tonight, Dad.
Rob says if you want to get ahead,

10:18.651 --> 10:20.778
you've got to work
while the other guy sleeps.

10:20.853 --> 10:24.186
Well, maybe l'll wake
the other guy up and he can help me.

10:27.193 --> 10:29.889
- He sure likes that new boss of his.
- Why wouldn't he?

10:29.962 --> 10:34.194
l mean, Rob is 25. He's got a ski condo,
sports car, lots of girlfriends.

10:34.266 --> 10:37.633
- Everything Brad wants.
- Everything l want.

10:39.071 --> 10:40.971
Except the condo.

10:42.108 --> 10:45.635
So, Jill, you in the mood
for a little block-sanding tonight?

10:45.711 --> 10:47.611
Well, maybe.

10:47.680 --> 10:50.808
lf you spend some time
talking to me first.

10:50.883 --> 10:53.044
l'll do it myself.

10:57.723 --> 10:59.884
There you go, ma'am. Have a great day.

11:02.495 --> 11:06.659
Psst. Brad, you, uh,
talk to Holly about going out with me?

11:06.732 --> 11:09.098
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

11:09.168 --> 11:10.533
What'd she say?

11:10.603 --> 11:14.869
Her exact words were,
''Jason is a repulsive maggot.''

11:16.909 --> 11:18.877
Did she smile when she said it?

11:20.513 --> 11:22.481
- Holly!
- You're a disgusting worm.

11:22.581 --> 11:24.947
All right!

11:25.017 --> 11:27.781
l'm moving up the food chain.

11:28.821 --> 11:30.686
[laughs] Are you here again?

11:30.756 --> 11:34.021
No. Well, l was just leaving,
Rob, my man.

11:34.093 --> 11:36.118
l'm off to the lingerie shop.

11:36.195 --> 11:40.962
You never know when some young lady's
gonna need a [whispers] second opinion.

11:43.402 --> 11:46.337
Let's go to lunch. l'll take you
to that place l tell you about.

11:46.405 --> 11:50.102
Well, l sort of had plans.
But l could always cancel them.

11:50.176 --> 11:52.644
Well, great.
Just let me tell Holly that we're going.

11:52.712 --> 11:56.478
And remind her that this is a store
and all these things are for sale.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.942
Hey, Brad, l hope you're hungry.

12:00.019 --> 12:02.681
Listen, would you mind if l canceled?

12:02.755 --> 12:05.417
Well, no. What's the problem?

12:05.491 --> 12:09.257
Rob wants to take me
to lunch and talk business.

12:09.328 --> 12:12.559
Oh, yeah. All right. OK. Yeah.

12:12.631 --> 12:13.791
Where's he gonna take ya?

12:13.899 --> 12:17.665
To this place where the waitresses
dress up like pirate wenches.

12:19.271 --> 12:20.738
- Pirate's Plank.
- Yeah!

12:20.806 --> 12:24.139
Yeah. Watch out for wench number three.

12:24.210 --> 12:26.678
Her parrot... arrh... bites.

12:28.013 --> 12:29.981
- So we can have lunch another time?
- Yeah.

12:30.082 --> 12:32.209
l'll get lunch someplace else.
See you home.

12:32.284 --> 12:33.911
- All right.
- All right.

12:33.986 --> 12:36.113
- Hey, Brad. You ready to go?
- Yeah.

12:36.188 --> 12:38.019
- Are we gonna walk?
- l got a Porsche.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.455
- Got a permit?
- Yeah.

12:39.525 --> 12:42.016
- Then you drive.
- All right!

12:56.375 --> 12:58.343
Hi. Where'd you go for lunch?

12:58.444 --> 13:01.572
- [groans]
- Polish food.

13:01.647 --> 13:05.344
[groans]

13:05.417 --> 13:08.443
Polish food from Stan's in Hamtramck.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.489
[belches, groans]

13:17.930 --> 13:21.093
Why didn't you and Brad
just have lunch at the mall?

13:21.200 --> 13:23.634
He made plans to eat with Rob.

13:23.702 --> 13:26.762
Wow! His boss
is taking him out to lunch.

13:26.839 --> 13:29.307
- This job is really working out.
- Maybe it's just me,

13:29.375 --> 13:32.640
but l think he's picking up
a lot of bad habits down there.

13:32.711 --> 13:37.148
- Noticed what he does in the morning?
- Couldn't be any worse than you.

13:37.950 --> 13:40.783
- Reading the financial section.
- What's wrong with that?

13:40.853 --> 13:44.812
You don't do that.
You read the sports section first.

13:44.890 --> 13:48.724
Then the comics. And then whatever
that first section's called.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.396
The news.

13:52.464 --> 13:56.332
He's been reading those brochures.
He should be out doing fun things.

13:56.402 --> 13:58.734
- Like what?
- Well, like studying

13:58.804 --> 14:01.102
for those PT-1 09 tests.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.701
Or helping you with the hot rod.

14:05.778 --> 14:10.147
Jill, these are Brad's
formative block-sanding years.

14:10.216 --> 14:14.175
This is so sweet.
You're jealous of Rob.

14:14.286 --> 14:16.379
l'm not jealous of Rob.

14:16.455 --> 14:19.083
l just don't want Brad
to become so obsessed with work

14:19.158 --> 14:22.719
- that it takes over his life.
- This is new and exciting to him now.

14:22.828 --> 14:24.659
Once he gets used to it,
he'll calm down.

14:24.730 --> 14:26.391
Then it'll be part of his routine.

14:26.465 --> 14:28.296
Yeah. Kind of like marriage, huh?

14:28.367 --> 14:30.392
When you first get married,
it's exciting.

14:30.469 --> 14:32.437
Then it, you know...
You know, it turns...

14:34.373 --> 14:35.863
lt's not, you know, it's not...

14:35.941 --> 14:38.808
lt's not like that at all.
lt's more... lt's not a job.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.812
lt's more of an adventure.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.519
<i>[phone rings]</i>

14:56.829 --> 14:59.389
<i>[continues ringing]</i>

14:59.465 --> 15:01.126
Why don't l get that?

15:02.434 --> 15:05.801
Hello? Hello, Angela.
You want to talk to Brad, huh? Uh-huh.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.668
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.605
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

15:09.675 --> 15:12.644
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

15:12.745 --> 15:16.112
Uh-huh. Uh... Listen, Angela.
l know l said l'd be free.

15:16.181 --> 15:18.741
But, uh, Rob asked me
to do inventory tonight.

15:19.652 --> 15:21.620
l don't know.
Maybe next weekend.

15:21.687 --> 15:24.850
Yeah. All right.
Talk to you tomorrow. Bye.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.551
Let me get this straight.

15:26.625 --> 15:31.892
Rather than going out with a beautiful
girl, you would rather count shoes.

15:31.964 --> 15:37.300
lt's a chance to really bump up
my paycheck. So, Dad, ballpark:

15:37.369 --> 15:38.927
How much are you pulling down?

15:41.941 --> 15:43.909
That's a good question.

15:44.009 --> 15:47.570
And if you ever ask me again,
you are out of the ballpark!

15:51.050 --> 15:52.984
When's dinner?

15:53.052 --> 15:54.610
And hello to you too.

15:54.720 --> 15:58.156
We're gonna eat as soon
as Brad gets back from his PMS test.

16:00.993 --> 16:01.960
That's today?

16:02.061 --> 16:05.326
l mean, l just saw Brad through the
window at the sporting goods store.

16:05.397 --> 16:08.161
He was supposed
to leave at noon to take the test.

16:08.233 --> 16:11.396
Well, uh, maybe it wasn't
through the window at the store.

16:11.503 --> 16:14.631
Maybe l saw Brad
through the window at school. Yeah.

16:14.707 --> 16:17.642
That's it. He was taking the test.
He was doing well. Gotta go.

16:20.913 --> 16:24.280
- l knew this job was gonna be trouble.
- l can't believe he didn't take it.

16:24.350 --> 16:26.477
Uh, Sports Universe. This is Brad.

16:26.552 --> 16:28.520
Uh, you're busted. lt's Dad.

16:29.488 --> 16:32.787
What are you doing there? You're
supposed to be taking your PSATs!

16:32.858 --> 16:34.951
Holly was supposed
to take over for me at noon.

16:35.027 --> 16:38.053
But she had to go to the doctor
because she had a tongue rash.

16:38.130 --> 16:40.155
We told you you could take this job

16:40.232 --> 16:42.723
as long as it didn't interfere
with school. Remember?

16:42.801 --> 16:45.634
Look, l can take the PSATs another day.

16:45.704 --> 16:48.673
Rob never even went to college
and he's doing pretty well.

16:50.075 --> 16:52.441
l'm with a customer.
l'll talk to you later.

16:52.511 --> 16:55.537
<i>No, you'll.. He'll talk to us later.</i>

16:55.614 --> 16:58.981
Well, you're right.
Rob is definitely a bad influence.

16:59.084 --> 17:02.383
- l told you he was gonna be trouble.
- Well, what are we gonna do?

17:07.326 --> 17:09.055
Well, since we're in the same house,

17:09.127 --> 17:12.256
l think the first step would be
to stop talking on the phones.

17:16.835 --> 17:18.301
Excuse me.

17:20.839 --> 17:22.396
Whoa!

17:23.308 --> 17:25.002
ls Brad Taylor here?

17:25.077 --> 17:28.240
ls anybody really here?

17:30.149 --> 17:35.416
Or are we all just random combinations
of sub-atomic particles?

17:37.489 --> 17:40.856
<i># Oooee-ooee-ooee #</i>

17:46.065 --> 17:48.829
Follow me.

17:48.934 --> 17:52.097
l'm looking for a random grouping
of sub-atomic molecules

17:52.204 --> 17:54.502
with blond hair
that looks like my son Brad.

17:54.573 --> 17:59.704
Yeah. Yeah. He went on an errand for
my money-grubbing, capitalist brother.

18:00.546 --> 18:03.413
l'll wait for him. l'll sit
in this fancy little chair here.

18:03.482 --> 18:05.575
Yeah, you break it, you buy it.

18:14.393 --> 18:16.361
[sighs]

18:22.367 --> 18:24.631
[vibrating]

18:29.475 --> 18:31.602
Well, l see you've gotten
to know the chair.

18:31.677 --> 18:34.840
Actually, the chair
just got to know me. Howdy.

18:39.017 --> 18:41.178
l'm Tim Taylor. l'm Brad's dad.

18:41.286 --> 18:42.981
- Hey, the Tool Man!
- Yeah.

18:43.055 --> 18:45.023
A chair like this
would really come in handy

18:45.124 --> 18:48.184
after a hard day
of injuries and explosions.

18:49.528 --> 18:51.894
Well, l didn't come here
to talk about chairs.

18:51.997 --> 18:54.761
- l came here to talk to Brad.
- He's a great kid. l'm Rob.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.698
Yeah. l know who you are, Rob.

18:56.768 --> 19:00.329
You got the Porsche and the ski condo
at Bowie Mountain, you know.

19:00.439 --> 19:03.374
You think working here
is more important than college tests.

19:03.442 --> 19:05.603
What are you talking about?
l never said that.

19:05.711 --> 19:09.613
Well, then why did Brad skip his test
to cover for jolly Holly over there?

19:12.684 --> 19:14.652
- l didn't know he had a test.
- Well, he did.

19:14.753 --> 19:17.449
He doesn't care about that
now that you got his head filled

19:17.523 --> 19:19.650
- with all these crazy ideas.
- Like what?

19:19.725 --> 19:23.684
Well, how about like, ''Rob didn't go
to college. He's doing pretty well.''

19:23.795 --> 19:25.285
Yeah, l'm doing pretty well now.

19:25.364 --> 19:28.265
Brad doesn't know about the
crummy jobs l had before l got here.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.494
Well, maybe it'd be a good idea
if you told him.

19:30.569 --> 19:35.734
l spent two years cleaning bathrooms at
Stan's Polish Restaurant in Hamtramck?

19:41.480 --> 19:44.142
You wouldn't believe
what goes on in there.

19:46.752 --> 19:48.481
Yeah, l would.

19:50.222 --> 19:52.486
You know,
l would never tell Brad that this job

19:52.558 --> 19:55.618
- is more important than college.
- Well, the problem is...

19:55.694 --> 19:58.458
Dad, what are you doing here?

19:59.932 --> 20:02.400
l came down here to tell you
l want you to quit this job.

20:02.467 --> 20:06.233
Because l missed the PSATs? l told you
l would take them another day.

20:06.338 --> 20:08.966
Your dad wants to make sure
you got priorities straight.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.134
Rob, l think l can handle this.

20:12.244 --> 20:15.008
l just want to make sure
you got your priorities straight.

20:16.148 --> 20:18.708
l was gonna say that.

20:18.817 --> 20:21.081
There's nothing more important
than education.

20:21.153 --> 20:23.121
Your dad's right.
Wish l had a better one.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.746
- Rob?
- Sorry.

20:27.125 --> 20:30.026
l'm pretty damn proud of my education.
Not that l flaunt it.

20:30.095 --> 20:33.326
There's a lot of people l've got
convinced l have no education at all.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.033
All right. l made a mistake.

20:36.101 --> 20:39.070
l shouldn't have skipped the test.
l didn't want to let Rob down.

20:42.608 --> 20:45.099
Look, what would let me down
is if you have to quit,

20:45.177 --> 20:47.008
l lose my best sales person.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.411
lf l cared, l'd resent that.

20:52.384 --> 20:54.852
Look, you guys let me know
what you decide, all right?

20:54.920 --> 20:58.583
l'm gonna go over
and give Holly her annual evaluation.

20:59.224 --> 21:01.055
You stink!

21:03.328 --> 21:05.159
Come on, Dad.
Give me one more chance.

21:05.230 --> 21:07.460
l'll take my PSATs,
l'll keep my grades up

21:07.532 --> 21:10.296
and l'll show you
that school comes first.

21:10.402 --> 21:12.768
Great. Aren't you forgetting
one important thing?

21:12.871 --> 21:15.203
- What Mom thinks?
- Who? Mom?

21:15.274 --> 21:19.711
Yeah! Yes! Yes! What your mother thinks.

21:19.778 --> 21:21.803
That, and...

21:21.880 --> 21:23.973
...you know,
working on the hot rod with me.

21:24.049 --> 21:27.416
[laughs] OK, Dad.
l promise no matter how busy l get,

21:27.519 --> 21:30.682
l'll always make time for the hot rod.

21:30.789 --> 21:32.484
That's my boy.

21:33.759 --> 21:35.420
That's my man.

21:37.095 --> 21:38.824
Come on. l'll walk you out.

21:41.933 --> 21:43.798
- [whistling]
- Hey, Wilson.

21:43.869 --> 21:46.702
Well, hidy-ho, Taylor lads.

21:46.772 --> 21:49.707
So, you given up
on rollerblading yet?

21:49.775 --> 21:52.676
Nay, nay, neighbor.
l've been practicing all week.

21:52.744 --> 21:57.306
And if l say so myself,
the results have been bitchin', dude!

21:59.518 --> 22:02.749
- Do you really know how to skate?
- Do l know how to skate?

22:03.622 --> 22:05.055
Watch me.

22:13.565 --> 22:16.659
Wilson, that's amazing.
ls there anything you can't do?

22:16.735 --> 22:19.397
Yeah! l don't know how to stop!

22:19.471 --> 22:22.031
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
