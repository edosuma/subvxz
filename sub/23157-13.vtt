WEBVTT

00:00.160 --> 00:02.651
I've been saving myself
for the right man.

00:08.401 --> 00:10.767
He's guarding a horse! A horse?

00:10.837 --> 00:14.204
If anybody killed him, I just couldn't
stand it. I'm scared to death.

00:14.274 --> 00:17.437
Get on your horse
and ride like the champion you are.

00:17.510 --> 00:22.277
I called the society editor at the newspaper
to find out precisely what to wear.

00:22.349 --> 00:24.579
Have a cigar.
Don't burn the barn down.

00:25.919 --> 00:27.784
What happened? He got Adelaide.

01:38.158 --> 01:41.060
Every have one of
those perfect afternoons?

01:41.085 --> 01:43.952
The sun's not too hot.
There's just enough breeze.

01:44.031 --> 01:48.400
- You're hitting the ball straight down.
- Hey!

01:48.468 --> 01:52.029
But there must be something wrong with me,
because it's always that perfect moment...

01:52.105 --> 01:54.437
when a little voice tells me
disaster's about to strike.

01:57.844 --> 02:01.245
Magnum, a word with you, please.

02:01.315 --> 02:04.614
- Higgins, it is game point.
- Has it occurred to you...

02:04.685 --> 02:06.676
just how embarrassing it would
be for Robin Masters...

02:06.753 --> 02:09.050
if you should somehow
win the club championship?

02:09.122 --> 02:11.886
- What? - Not only are you
Robin's guest at the club,

02:11.959 --> 02:14.427
but your partner is a guest too.

02:14.494 --> 02:17.292
A guest of a guest, as it were.

02:17.364 --> 02:20.060
- Higgins, are you asking me to
throw the match? - Of course not.

02:20.133 --> 02:23.625
I'm only asking you to consider
how it will look if two guests win...

02:23.704 --> 02:26.468
and then go on to represent the club
for the island championship.

02:28.408 --> 02:30.876
Resume play.

02:30.944 --> 02:33.003
Embarrassing?

02:36.583 --> 02:38.676
Out.

02:38.752 --> 02:41.619
My only problem was
the little voice didn't tell me...

02:41.688 --> 02:44.316
the disaster had dark brown hair,

02:44.391 --> 02:46.951
wore big glasses
and called herself...

02:47.027 --> 02:50.190
Adelaide Malone.
You're Thomas Magnum?

02:51.264 --> 02:54.233
Yes, ma'am. At your service.

02:54.301 --> 02:56.895
I'm sorry. These aren't my working clothes.
Thanks, T.C.

02:56.970 --> 03:01.270
No. No, I-it's not that. It's just
that I was expecting something...

03:01.341 --> 03:03.275
I mean,
someone a little different.

03:03.343 --> 03:06.141
- Most people are.
- Did you wanna hire me?

03:06.213 --> 03:08.807
Someone's trying to extract...

03:08.882 --> 03:11.851
an enormous amount of money
under threat of violence.

03:11.918 --> 03:13.943
That's extortion, isn't it?

03:14.021 --> 03:15.955
And they're going to kill Norman
if we don't pay them,

03:16.023 --> 03:17.957
but we don't have the money,
at least not yet,

03:18.025 --> 03:20.425
even if we were going
to give it to them.

03:21.461 --> 03:24.726
This is an important
and confidential matter.

03:24.798 --> 03:26.857
Do you think we should be
discussing business in front of...

03:26.933 --> 03:29.401
Miss Malone, these men
are my associates.

03:29.469 --> 03:32.029
They assist me on my bigger cases.

03:32.105 --> 03:34.835
Then we should discuss business first.

03:34.908 --> 03:37.672
I didn't appreciate that you
were such a large operation,

03:37.744 --> 03:40.736
and I only have $350 for your fee.

03:40.814 --> 03:42.748
I think you're right. We should
discuss this on our own.

03:42.816 --> 03:45.148
Your add in the Yellow Pages
said "" reasonable rates, "

03:45.218 --> 03:47.311
but it didn't mention anything
about a staff.

03:47.387 --> 03:51.153
Wait. You actually found Magnum through
the Yellow Pages? You gotta be kidding.

03:51.224 --> 03:53.749
Your fingers do the walking.

03:53.827 --> 03:57.228
Well, all of the big agencies were
too expensive, and the small ones...

03:57.297 --> 03:59.993
"Big ag... '"
didn't seem interested.

04:00.067 --> 04:02.535
At least, I didn't think
they were sincerely interested.

04:02.602 --> 04:05.730
But when I mentioned your name to my uncle,
Charles Cathcart, his reaction was...

04:05.806 --> 04:09.367
Charlie Cathcart? Captain
Cathcart, the navy surgeon?

04:09.443 --> 04:12.105
He's retired now.
Did you know him?

04:13.246 --> 04:15.237
Well, I'll never forget him.

04:16.349 --> 04:20.547
Captain Charles Cathcart
was a wild man, even for 'Nam.

04:20.620 --> 04:24.021
He was famous for his temper
and his skill as a surgeon.

04:24.091 --> 04:27.527
I didn't like the first part,
but the second had saved my life.

04:27.594 --> 04:30.188
Last I'd heard,
his hospital had been hit by sappers,

04:30.263 --> 04:32.197
and he'd been shipped home.

04:32.265 --> 04:34.631
It was hard to believe
his niece was Miss Malone.

04:34.701 --> 04:38.762
Call me Adelaide. "" Miss Malone" sounds
like a spinster, and I'm only 32,

04:38.839 --> 04:40.830
which is an old maid
only if you're in Iowa,

04:40.907 --> 04:43.137
which is one reason I left.

04:43.210 --> 04:46.202
Does Norman live at the ranch?
Yes.

04:46.279 --> 04:50.010
Uncle Charles bought the acreage on the
Big Island 20 years ago to retire on.

04:50.083 --> 04:55.646
What'd the police say about someone
threatening to kill... Norman?

04:55.722 --> 04:58.555
Uh, you did call 5-O,
didn't you?

04:58.625 --> 05:00.786
Oh, that was the first thing I did.

05:00.861 --> 05:04.558
No disrespect, Mr. Magnum, but the police
do work for free for the taxpayers,

05:04.631 --> 05:06.758
and I've always paid my taxes
all my life.

05:06.833 --> 05:09.734
So when the first phone call
came in, I naturally...

05:09.803 --> 05:11.862
The first phone call?
How many have you gotten?

05:11.938 --> 05:15.567
Three, not counting the heavy
breather who wouldn't say anything.

05:18.345 --> 05:20.813
But since I was
the only one who talked to them,

05:20.881 --> 05:23.441
and there was no evidence,
the police said they couldn't help me,

05:23.483 --> 05:27.613
which is when I decided to hire a private
investigator, in spite of everything my uncle said.

05:27.687 --> 05:30.451
You may be asking why
I wasn't suspicious.

05:30.524 --> 05:32.651
Tell me the truth.
Would you be suspicious...

05:32.726 --> 05:35.354
of a 32-year-old girl from Iowa...

05:35.428 --> 05:37.953
who wore sensible shoes
and glasses...

05:38.031 --> 05:40.625
and had a smile like Adelaide's?

05:51.044 --> 05:54.707
Uncle Charles,
this is Mr. Magnum.

05:54.781 --> 05:57.477
Good to see you again, sir.

05:57.551 --> 06:00.987
Well, Magnum,

06:01.054 --> 06:03.488
I didn't think you'd remember me.

06:03.557 --> 06:06.048
'Nam's a long time ago
for most people.

06:06.126 --> 06:10.153
Well, I have good reason to remember,
sir, and be grateful. Thank you again.

06:10.230 --> 06:13.631
Most people would forget that
soon enough too.

06:15.368 --> 06:19.361
Well, Adelaide told me about the threats
against Norman. I hope I can be of help.

06:19.439 --> 06:23.739
I hate to disappoint you, but quite
frankly, I can handle the situation myself.

06:30.050 --> 06:32.075
You seem to have
some problem, sir.

06:32.152 --> 06:34.313
I don't know what it is, but...
Then I'll tell you.

06:34.387 --> 06:37.754
You were a damn fine officer.

06:37.824 --> 06:41.419
You had the makings
of a brilliant career. Brilliant.

06:41.494 --> 06:44.986
You threw it away
to be a private eye.

06:45.065 --> 06:49.468
Investigator. And I didn't throw
anything away. I resigned.

06:49.536 --> 06:52.403
I'll always be grateful for those years,
but it's not my life now.

06:52.472 --> 06:55.373
But it's mine. Mine!

06:56.543 --> 06:59.706
I'd give anything... to be back.

07:00.747 --> 07:05.377
So you understand, when I see
somebody who quit and walked away,

07:06.519 --> 07:09.386
it makes me... angry.

07:16.363 --> 07:19.093
I apologize for my uncle.

07:19.165 --> 07:22.396
One thing sure hasn't changed.
That's his temper.

07:22.469 --> 07:26.200
Would you like to meet Norman?
Not if he's like your uncle.

07:26.273 --> 07:30.039
Where is he? Inside?
No, not exactly.

07:30.110 --> 07:32.271
I know what you're thinking.

07:32.345 --> 07:34.506
I should've been suspicious.

07:34.581 --> 07:37.914
But I was too teed off
at Captain Cathcart.

07:37.984 --> 07:41.818
He'd hit a real sore spot,
and I wasn't thinking straight.

07:41.888 --> 07:45.688
For a private investigator,
that's a terrible mistake.

07:46.926 --> 07:48.917
Norman lives in the stable?

07:50.230 --> 07:52.698
Norman's your trainer.

07:55.068 --> 07:57.059
Norman's a jockey?

08:08.948 --> 08:10.882
Norman's a horse.
Not just a horse.

08:10.950 --> 08:14.147
He's a grand prix jumper.
You lied to me.

08:15.655 --> 08:18.283
I did not.

08:18.358 --> 08:21.293
Well, you sure didn't
tell me the truth.

08:21.361 --> 08:26.389
Well, would you have
come out here if I did?

08:26.466 --> 08:29.060
None of the others would.

08:32.272 --> 08:35.707
Won't you just listen?
You don't understand.

08:35.775 --> 08:38.642
What I do understand is why
your uncle's so teed off at me.

08:38.712 --> 08:40.873
And he's right.
I didn't resign from the navy...

08:40.947 --> 08:43.279
to do guard duty on a horse.

08:43.350 --> 08:48.185
My uncle's too proud to admit it, but
Norman represents every nickel we have.

08:48.254 --> 08:50.916
Higgins put you up to this, didn't he,
to keep me out of the volleyball finals?

08:50.990 --> 08:53.322
No. After the horse show,

08:53.393 --> 08:55.327
provided Norman wins,
and I know he will,

08:55.395 --> 08:57.989
because he's done well on the
mainland circuit all season,

08:58.064 --> 09:01.192
we're gonna sell him
for $250, 000.

09:01.267 --> 09:05.260
But it's not the money.
Norman's wonderful and intelligent.

09:05.338 --> 09:09.001
If anybody killed him,
I just couldn't stand it.

09:09.075 --> 09:11.543
If you leave now,
I don't know what I'll do.

09:11.611 --> 09:14.409
But if you are gonna leave,
then hurry up,

09:14.481 --> 09:18.542
because I'm about to cry,
and I've not lost all my pride.

09:26.192 --> 09:27.989
Aah!

09:28.061 --> 09:31.394
I know what you're thinking.
I was crazy not to have driven that Jeep...

09:31.464 --> 09:33.728
right out of there
when I had the chance.

09:33.800 --> 09:36.030
But T.C. had flown back to Oahu,

09:36.102 --> 09:39.538
and I couldn't have gotten a boat or a
commercial flight back until the next morning.

09:39.606 --> 09:44.339
Besides, you wouldn't walk out on a girl
with sensible shoes and a smile like that.

09:44.411 --> 09:46.345
Of course you wouldn't. Hi.

09:46.413 --> 09:49.075
Hi. I brought sleeping
bags and pillows.

09:49.149 --> 09:51.083
You do use a pillow, don't you?

09:51.151 --> 09:53.085
I thought you looked
like the pillow type.

09:53.153 --> 09:55.986
Not that I'm saying I've had a
lot of experience. Adelaide...

09:56.055 --> 09:59.513
Adelaide, are you going to spend the
night out here with me tonight?

09:59.592 --> 10:03.221
No. Well, uh, yes. Um... I...

10:03.296 --> 10:06.163
I sleep out here often...
on this cot.

10:06.232 --> 10:10.498
I thought you could sleep on...
on the hay bales over there.

10:10.570 --> 10:14.631
I just... I couldn't possibly
sleep inside in a warm bed...

10:14.707 --> 10:17.505
with you out here ready
to risk your life for Norman.

10:17.577 --> 10:20.512
Well, I don't think
I'm doing that exactly.

10:20.580 --> 10:23.174
What I mean is, I don't think
Norman's in any real danger.

10:25.185 --> 10:27.551
You don't believe I got
those phone calls.

10:27.620 --> 10:29.554
The police didn't take me
seriously either.

10:29.622 --> 10:32.318
Yes, I do. All I'm saying is,
I don't think those guys...

10:32.392 --> 10:35.088
will try and harm Norman
before the horse show,

10:35.161 --> 10:37.254
because that's when
he's most valuable.

10:38.498 --> 10:41.194
Oh. Yeah.

10:50.210 --> 10:52.144
How long you been a breeder,
Adelaide?

10:52.212 --> 10:54.146
Uh, just five years.

10:54.214 --> 10:57.115
But our success is mostly due
to Uncle Charles.

10:57.183 --> 11:00.209
He has all our horses
on a super nutritional program.

11:00.286 --> 11:03.119
Special feeds,
steroids, vitamins.

11:03.189 --> 11:06.716
That's why all our jumpers
are so strong and beautiful.

11:08.728 --> 11:12.220
And before that, Iowa? Yeah.

11:12.298 --> 11:17.565
Let me guess what you did
home... Home economics.

11:17.637 --> 11:22.233
I used to teach eighth grade
girls for seven years.

11:22.308 --> 11:24.401
And boys too.
I certainly wasn't sexist.

11:24.477 --> 11:26.411
Oh, I'm sure you weren't.

11:26.479 --> 11:30.074
We just did simple cooking
and simple sewing.

11:30.149 --> 11:33.448
I could knock off a meat loaf
and run up a set of curtains...

11:33.520 --> 11:35.784
faster than anybody
west of Des Moines.

11:35.855 --> 11:39.382
But no Mr. Right?
You're making fun of me.

11:40.460 --> 11:43.258
No, I'm not. I wouldn't do that.

11:46.966 --> 11:48.900
I promise you
I'll never do that, Adelaide.

11:57.076 --> 11:59.874
- Mr. Magnum?
- Yeah?

11:59.946 --> 12:04.246
I hope you don't think
I was using feminine wiles on you.

12:04.317 --> 12:06.251
When?

12:08.121 --> 12:11.249
This afternoon,
when I was asking you to stay...

12:11.324 --> 12:14.725
and when I said I might cry...

12:14.794 --> 12:17.661
I mean, I'm really
a very honest person,

12:17.730 --> 12:20.164
and I feel terrible
that I tricked you.

12:21.167 --> 12:23.158
Just so you understand.

12:24.237 --> 12:26.865
Oh, Adelaide, I understand.

12:37.450 --> 12:40.078
Adelaide? Yeah?

12:42.088 --> 12:45.580
Your glasses. You gonna go
to bed with your glasses on?

12:45.658 --> 12:47.649
No.

12:54.767 --> 12:57.759
- Good night.
- Good night.

13:11.017 --> 13:13.781
Morning came,
and I figured we were safe.

13:17.457 --> 13:19.482
Adelaide was still asleep, but...

13:19.559 --> 13:22.119
I need coffee before
I can really get moving.

13:22.195 --> 13:25.130
I was just gonna slip into the
kitchen when I heard something.

13:25.198 --> 13:28.929
At first I couldn't believe it.
They were even wearing black hats.

13:29.002 --> 13:31.698
And all this was before coffee.

14:11.994 --> 14:14.258
What happened?
They got Adelaide.

14:17.299 --> 14:21.326
I know what you're thinking.
A classic diversion.

14:21.403 --> 14:24.702
I was supposed to follow them, then
they could come back for Norman.

14:24.773 --> 14:28.766
I know that. The trouble
is I didn't have a choice.

14:53.636 --> 14:56.662
Gonna get rid of you, lady.

15:10.719 --> 15:12.949
What if they got Norman?

15:13.022 --> 15:15.252
Could you drive faster, please?

15:19.161 --> 15:21.925
Norman! Norman!

15:27.469 --> 15:29.801
Norman.

15:29.872 --> 15:32.204
They've killed him!

15:32.274 --> 15:34.936
Norman. They've killed him.

15:36.979 --> 15:38.776
Adelaide.

15:38.847 --> 15:42.112
Adelaide, listen to me. They just
tranquilized him. He's not dead.

15:42.184 --> 15:45.278
Adelaide... He's not...

15:45.354 --> 15:48.414
It's all right, boy. He's not...

15:48.490 --> 15:50.424
It was just a warning.

15:50.492 --> 15:52.585
It's okay, boy. Come on.

15:54.263 --> 15:57.926
- It's all right. It's all right.
- He's okay.

16:15.150 --> 16:18.347
I had put Norman, Adelaide
and Cathcart on a boat for Oahu.

16:18.420 --> 16:20.354
They'd be safe there.
But my main worry...

16:20.422 --> 16:22.481
was the security
at the show grounds.

16:22.558 --> 16:24.685
But I knew my... associates...

16:24.760 --> 16:27.194
would be more than happy
to help me on this one.

16:27.263 --> 16:29.788
After all,
everybody likes horses.

16:31.533 --> 16:33.467
Man, I don't dig no horses.

16:33.535 --> 16:35.662
Look, Robin Masters
has a box for the show.

16:35.738 --> 16:39.572
Higgins only enjoys polo. So it'll
only go to waste if you guys don't go.

16:39.642 --> 16:41.576
Mm-hmm. Thanks.

16:41.644 --> 16:45.637
This Norman that they're trying to
kill, is he gonna be at the show?

16:45.714 --> 16:49.343
Sort of. In a way, yeah, he's gonna
be there. But what does that...

16:49.418 --> 16:52.444
Oh, man, I knew it. I knew it.

16:52.521 --> 16:56.423
He just wants us there to help him
keep an eye on his client.

16:56.492 --> 16:59.461
Hey, guys, it's not that at all.

16:59.528 --> 17:02.759
I'll bet you this Norman, whatever,
is gonna be sitting right next to us...

17:02.831 --> 17:05.060
when the bullets start flying
all over the place.

17:05.134 --> 17:07.762
Well, if they're out
to get this Norman,

17:07.836 --> 17:09.895
why would he be at the show
in the first place?

17:09.972 --> 17:14.102
I just don't understand it.
Unless...

17:14.175 --> 17:16.541
Thomas, tell me the truth.

17:16.612 --> 17:19.079
If you don't want the box,
just say so. I gotta go.

17:19.147 --> 17:21.116
I knew it! I knew it!

17:21.183 --> 17:24.414
The great Thomas Magnum, private
detective, is guarding a horse!

17:24.486 --> 17:27.546
He's guarding a horse! A horse?

17:32.661 --> 17:37.963
It so happens that Norman is worth a
quarter of a million dollars for stud...

17:38.033 --> 17:40.001
if he doesn't get killed.

17:40.069 --> 17:42.663
Oh, that's even better.

17:42.738 --> 17:46.606
A stud being guarded by Magnum, the
great... If you wanna go, let me know.

17:46.675 --> 17:51.305
But if you don't go, that's the last time I
try and set up something really nice for you!

17:51.380 --> 17:54.645
Okay. Back in the saddle again.

17:56.085 --> 17:59.680
Can you imagine you and I
at a horse show in a box?

17:59.755 --> 18:03.521
Man, like I said,
I don't dig no horses.

18:03.592 --> 18:07.926
And all those beautiful,
rich, fancy women.

18:07.996 --> 18:11.557
They're dumb.
They're pushy. They smell.

18:11.633 --> 18:13.760
Ah, the horses, I mean.

18:17.773 --> 18:22.733
Hey, T.C., I wonder what you wear
at something like that.

18:22.811 --> 18:25.279
I don't know.

18:58.113 --> 19:01.742
You look like champs to me.
Norman is for sure.

19:01.817 --> 19:04.684
There's only one other horse who
can touch him... Arabella Hill.

19:09.024 --> 19:11.686
He's owned by the Maltby Stables
in Boston.

19:11.760 --> 19:14.752
He and Norman have been one and two
all over the country this season.

19:14.830 --> 19:16.798
We just gotta beat him tomorrow.

19:17.966 --> 19:20.491
Well, don't worry.
You'll do just fine.

19:20.569 --> 19:23.561
I'm beginning to think so too.
Miss Malone?

19:23.639 --> 19:25.937
Yeah. You have a phone call. You
can take it in the judges' booth.

19:26.008 --> 19:30.035
Oh, thank you. Thanks.
Maybe it's Uncle Charles.

19:30.112 --> 19:33.013
No, no. I just saw him in the stables.
It can't be.

19:42.925 --> 19:44.859
- Hello.
- You wouldn't believe us,

19:44.927 --> 19:46.918
so we had to knock Norman out
to make our point.

19:46.995 --> 19:50.988
Now we want 50,000, or you and that
horse will never leave that ring alive.

19:51.066 --> 19:54.558
Understand? Stop it!
just stop it!

19:54.636 --> 19:56.797
You're monstrous
to wanna kill a horse!

19:59.441 --> 20:02.933
Adelaide, next time, would you
at least give them a chance...

20:03.011 --> 20:05.741
to tell you where to deliver
the money before you hang up?

20:05.814 --> 20:08.180
We don't have 50,000...
dollars. Shh!

20:08.250 --> 20:11.219
I know we don't, but it might
give me a chance to catch them.

20:11.286 --> 20:14.687
Oh. Okay.

20:14.756 --> 20:16.951
Thank you very much.

20:18.927 --> 20:22.328
I'm sorry. I know this isn't
as nice as my barn, but...

20:24.533 --> 20:26.865
This is beginning to seem
like old times.

20:27.870 --> 20:31.169
After Norman's sold, I probably won't
be able to sleep in a real bed again.

20:31.240 --> 20:34.175
Of course, you're probably
used to this...

20:34.243 --> 20:38.179
sleeping in exotic locations
filled with adventure and danger.

20:38.247 --> 20:40.875
I mean, not sleeping with women
in strange places.

20:40.949 --> 20:45.181
Well, of course, maybe you do, but I
certainly... It's none of my business.

20:45.254 --> 20:48.348
Adelaide. Adelaide.

20:48.423 --> 20:53.326
My relationships with my clients
are professional.

20:53.395 --> 20:56.159
And my private life is...

20:57.499 --> 20:59.433
private.

20:59.501 --> 21:01.594
Well, I'm glad to hear that,

21:01.670 --> 21:04.366
because I was afraid that I
was a disappointment to you.

21:04.439 --> 21:07.169
I was a disappointment
to men back in Iowa.

21:07.242 --> 21:11.144
Lord knows, Iowa's not Hawaii.
But, you see,

21:11.213 --> 21:13.977
I've been saving myself
for the right man.

21:14.049 --> 21:16.381
Well, I think that's just fine.

21:16.451 --> 21:18.385
Do you really? Mm-hmm.

21:18.453 --> 21:22.389
Because lately I've been worried
that maybe I've been saved too long.

21:22.457 --> 21:25.949
Like a jar of strawberry preserves on the
shelf all winter that just explodes one day.

21:26.028 --> 21:29.293
And there you are with...
jam all over the ceiling...

21:29.364 --> 21:31.628
and broken glass
all over the floor.

21:31.700 --> 21:36.069
Adelaide, no one's gonna confuse
you with strawberry preserves.

21:36.138 --> 21:39.574
So,

21:39.641 --> 21:44.078
with the reputation of a private
investigator being what it is,

21:44.146 --> 21:46.842
I've been nervous that
you were gonna pounce.

21:50.319 --> 21:52.310
Pounce?

21:54.156 --> 21:58.149
And nervous about
what I'd do if you do.

21:58.226 --> 22:00.285
But lately, Mr. Magnum,

22:00.362 --> 22:03.388
I've been nervous about
what I'll do if you don't.

22:21.083 --> 22:23.381
That's where they're keeping
Arabella Hill.

22:23.452 --> 22:26.478
It's just a diversion.
Just like last time.

22:26.555 --> 22:29.388
Are you going out there?
Yeah, I just wanna say hi.

22:29.458 --> 22:32.586
I think this time things are
gonna be a little more even.

22:48.610 --> 22:50.908
Damn!

23:09.898 --> 23:11.957
Are you all right?
Ever since I met you,

23:12.034 --> 23:15.936
that's all people have been asking me,
and frankly, I'm beginning to wonder.

23:34.956 --> 23:38.915
Thomas, I know you like to work closely
with your clients, but this is ridiculous.

23:38.994 --> 23:41.087
Hi, guys. It's great to see you.

23:41.163 --> 23:44.496
Something of a surprise,
but still great.

23:46.568 --> 23:49.162
Yes?

23:49.237 --> 23:52.673
- What?
- Well, how do you like our outfits?

23:52.741 --> 23:55.073
They're... unbelievable.

23:55.143 --> 23:57.873
Yes. I called the society editor
at the newspaper...

23:57.946 --> 24:00.915
to find out
precisely what to wear.

24:03.318 --> 24:05.752
Was this a local paper, T.C.?

24:05.821 --> 24:08.756
You know we're not gonna embarrass
Robin Masters in front of his friends.

24:08.824 --> 24:12.089
I understand.
And believe me, I appreciate it.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.492
The box is... 4-A.

24:18.333 --> 24:20.324
Tallyho.

24:21.870 --> 24:24.805
Have a cigar.
Don't burn the barn down.

24:26.007 --> 24:28.271
Thank you very much.

24:37.586 --> 24:39.520
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,

24:39.588 --> 24:42.989
to the first annual Hawaii
International Horse Show.

24:43.058 --> 24:46.789
In just a short while, we'll begin the
finals for the grand prix jumpers...

24:46.862 --> 24:51.959
and find out which horse will walk
away with the $25,000 first prize.

24:56.304 --> 24:59.364
The Anglo-American grand prix
jumper is an extraordinary animal,

24:59.441 --> 25:01.966
combining the grace,
stamina and cunning of the Arab...

25:02.043 --> 25:05.809
with the stature, legs and muscular
strength of a thoroughbred.

25:05.881 --> 25:08.076
Magnum?

25:10.819 --> 25:13.686
What a surprise. Higgins.

25:13.755 --> 25:16.053
Ladies. Um...

25:16.124 --> 25:19.582
Why don't you ladies just proceed
to Mr. Masters's box?

25:24.266 --> 25:26.257
I thought you hated horse shows.

25:26.334 --> 25:28.928
I told you Robin Masters's aunt
and her daughter were coming.

25:29.004 --> 25:30.995
The girl is simply crazed
for animals.

25:31.072 --> 25:34.906
If it were polo, I could understand.
The thrill of a rugged chukker...

25:37.746 --> 25:40.010
- You're not here for the show, are you?
- What you really mean is...

25:40.081 --> 25:43.073
I'm not sharing Robin Masters's box
with you, isn't that it, Higgins?

25:43.151 --> 25:46.609
- Precisely. - The answer is no.
I happen to be here on a case.

25:47.689 --> 25:50.852
Oh? A divorcée and her lover are here?
Where's your camera?

25:51.993 --> 25:55.861
This is extortion, Higgins.
Life and death.

25:58.366 --> 26:00.300
Isn't that...

26:00.368 --> 26:03.929
Yes, that's the girl that so
desperately had to see you.

26:04.005 --> 26:06.098
- You're protecting her life?
- Higgins, just go to the box.

26:06.174 --> 26:08.472
I've gotta get back to work.

26:08.543 --> 26:10.340
Hi! Hi.

26:10.412 --> 26:12.539
Have you been telling Mr. Higgins
about the case?

26:12.614 --> 26:17.347
He's been a hero twice.
Last night he saved Norman's life.

26:17.419 --> 26:20.183
- Norman? Another uncle?
- Oh, no.

26:20.255 --> 26:22.189
Charles Cathcart is my uncle.
Norman is...

26:22.257 --> 26:24.885
Higgins, the five-gaited class
is just about to start.

26:24.960 --> 26:27.895
- Norman is?
- My horse.

26:28.997 --> 26:30.897
You're guarding her...

26:32.334 --> 26:35.098
Oh, Magnum, this is too much.

26:35.170 --> 26:39.436
It's too droll. Extortion and murder.
Really.

26:48.183 --> 26:50.208
We shall see about this.

26:52.053 --> 26:56.114
I kind of hoped he'd say that.
Magnum, I've just got one problem.

26:56.191 --> 26:58.455
I'm scared to death.

26:58.526 --> 27:01.188
My mouth is dry, my hands are
wet, and my heart is racing.

27:01.263 --> 27:03.993
If I'm scared, then he'll feel
it, and then he'll be scared,

27:04.065 --> 27:06.363
and then we won't perform
up to our peak... Adelaide.

27:06.434 --> 27:08.561
Adelaide.

27:08.637 --> 27:12.300
You are a bright, strong,
young woman from Iowa.

27:12.374 --> 27:14.308
Pioneer stock.

27:14.376 --> 27:18.278
Now, you're going to take a deep
breath, get on your horse...

27:19.681 --> 27:22.047
and ride like
the champion you are.

27:22.117 --> 27:24.950
All set, Adelaide. Time to go.

27:25.020 --> 27:26.954
But I don't know...
Because if you don't,

27:27.022 --> 27:28.956
they'll win.

27:29.024 --> 27:31.144
They'll have beaten you
even if they don't get Norman.

27:32.594 --> 27:34.585
Are you gonna let that happen?

27:36.965 --> 27:40.833
Now, let me see
that terrific smile.

27:44.572 --> 27:46.369
All right. Get on your horse.

28:01.056 --> 28:03.547
Do you really think
I have a terrific smile?

28:03.625 --> 28:05.559
Yes, I do.

28:06.628 --> 28:10.428
On behalf of all of us affiliated with
the Hawaii International Horse Show,

28:10.498 --> 28:14.730
we'd like to extend a special welcome to
our special guest, Mayor Ronald Carron.

28:22.644 --> 28:24.703
Robin Masters had a box
going to waste.!

28:24.779 --> 28:26.713
He threw us out! Out! Who did?

28:26.781 --> 28:30.114
Higgins. He threw us out of
Robin's box seats. 4-A, remember?

28:30.185 --> 28:32.386
Higgins hates horse shows.
I never thought he'd be here.

28:32.454 --> 28:35.287
Aw, forget it. I don't like
horses I can't bet on anyway.

28:35.357 --> 28:38.520
Oh, no, no. I'm standing here
clean as the board of health.

28:38.593 --> 28:41.187
I-I'm too dressed up for nothing.

28:41.262 --> 28:43.753
I'm with you, T.C. Your trip
out here shouldn't be wasted.

28:43.832 --> 28:45.732
I smell a rat. I know.

28:45.800 --> 28:49.861
You could help me watch Adelaide and
Norman while they're in the ring here.

28:49.938 --> 28:52.372
I knew it. I knew it.!

28:52.440 --> 28:54.374
He wanted to do us
a favor for a change.

28:54.442 --> 28:57.104
All you wanted us here
was for some surveillance for free.

28:57.178 --> 28:59.203
Man, I'm too dressed up
for any surveillance.

28:59.280 --> 29:03.080
It's not that at all, T.C. Why do you
always have to be so damn suspicious?

29:03.151 --> 29:06.484
I'm not asking... Rick.
Rick, tell him.

29:06.554 --> 29:08.613
Hey, come on, guys.
I need your help.

29:09.824 --> 29:12.520
Honest! Okay, okay.

29:14.129 --> 29:16.393
All right. Look.

29:16.464 --> 29:19.956
I was wrong, guys. I should've come
right out and asked you for your help.

29:20.035 --> 29:21.798
Uh-huh!

29:21.870 --> 29:25.203
Now, just why didn't you
do that, Thomas Magnum?

29:25.273 --> 29:27.764
Because I was afraid
you wouldn't wanna do it.

29:27.842 --> 29:31.141
You thought you'd have to make a deal.
A deal?

29:31.212 --> 29:33.203
Your bar tab. Some gas money.

29:33.281 --> 29:36.978
- Which?
- Both!

29:37.052 --> 29:38.986
Our next horse in
the final jump-off...

29:39.054 --> 29:42.046
of the $25,000 grand prix
is Arabella Hill...

29:42.123 --> 29:46.219
from the Maltby Stables in Boston,
ridden by Mr. Lawrence Maltby himself.

29:46.294 --> 29:50.025
The time to beat is 27.8 seconds.

30:25.767 --> 30:29.168
Let's have a big round of applause
for our new leader, Arabella Hill,

30:29.237 --> 30:34.038
for a clean round
with a time of 27.2 seconds.!

30:42.817 --> 30:45.183
Here's our next entrant
from the Morton Levy Stables,

30:45.253 --> 30:48.381
Binghamton, New York,
Gunshot, ridden by Arlene Levy.

31:30.765 --> 31:34.496
A good time for Gunshot.
28.2 seconds.

31:34.569 --> 31:36.901
Just one second too slow.

31:59.060 --> 32:02.461
Entering the ring, our last entry
in the jump-off is Norman,

32:02.530 --> 32:04.794
ridden by Adelaide Malone...

32:04.866 --> 32:08.302
from the Cathcart Ranch
on the Big Island of Hawaii.

32:08.369 --> 32:12.465
Remember, the time she has to beat
is 27.2 seconds.

32:51.512 --> 32:54.640
A perfect score
for Adelaide Malone's Norman.!

32:54.716 --> 32:58.174
- No faults.
- 26.4 seconds.

32:58.253 --> 33:02.587
Norman is our first
Hawaiian grand prix champion.

33:02.657 --> 33:04.989
Let's have a big round of applause
for Norman...

33:05.059 --> 33:08.426
and Miss Adelaide Malone.!

33:19.274 --> 33:22.766
On behalf of the Hawaiian
Thoroughbred Club,

33:22.844 --> 33:25.972
it gives me great pleasure to present
you with the winner's trophy.

33:26.047 --> 33:28.880
Thank you, sir.

33:32.920 --> 33:35.821
And this check for $25,000.

33:35.890 --> 33:39.018
Thank you again, sir. Thank you.

33:42.263 --> 33:44.697
My dear, you were magnificent.

33:44.766 --> 33:46.757
Oh, it was Norman.

33:46.834 --> 33:48.563
Thank you.

33:59.047 --> 34:02.448
I've got a bottle of champagne
for us to celebrate the sale.

34:02.517 --> 34:05.645
Well, not champagne exactly,
since I don't drink.

34:05.720 --> 34:08.018
But I didn't think you'd mind
if it was sparkling apple cider,

34:08.089 --> 34:11.252
since it looks the same
with the bubbles and all.

34:12.659 --> 34:14.650
I'm afraid I'm not
doing this very well.

34:16.664 --> 34:20.725
Oh, Adelaide, I think you're
coming through like a champ.

34:21.735 --> 34:23.726
Where's your uncle?

34:25.540 --> 34:28.532
He said he had to get to the bank
with our prize money,

34:28.609 --> 34:31.737
otherwise the check for Norman's
board and feed here would bounce.

34:31.813 --> 34:36.375
But actually, I think he's sentimental
about saying good-bye to Norman too.

34:36.451 --> 34:38.543
Wait a minute.
We're not handling the sale alone?

34:38.619 --> 34:40.643
Oh, no, of course not.

34:40.722 --> 34:43.589
Uncle Charles's lawyer,
William McDonald, is handling it.

34:43.658 --> 34:46.456
He's coming out with
Mr. Habib's representative.

34:46.527 --> 34:49.655
- You know Mr. McDonald?
- No.

34:49.731 --> 34:52.255
But Uncle Charles
gave me his card.

34:56.270 --> 34:58.670
What's wrong? Nothing.

34:58.740 --> 35:01.641
Only you and Norman
aren't really out of danger...

35:01.709 --> 35:04.735
till he's actually
in the buyer's van.

35:04.812 --> 35:07.542
I understand that,
but what's the problem?

35:07.615 --> 35:11.142
If you and I don't know
the people involved in the sale...

35:11.219 --> 35:13.153
But nobody's threatened us
since yesterday,

35:13.221 --> 35:15.212
and nothing happened
in the ring.

35:15.289 --> 35:18.258
I know. That's what's bugging me.
William McDonald, attorney at law.

35:18.326 --> 35:22.092
This is Thomas Magnum. I'm coordinating the
transfer of the Cathcart Ranch's horse.

35:22.163 --> 35:24.631
Could you tell me when Mr. McDonald
is due to arrive at the stables?

35:24.699 --> 35:27.793
He's on his way now.
He should be there any minute.

35:27.869 --> 35:30.337
Would you describe him to me
so I'll recognize him?

35:30.405 --> 35:32.430
He's about 45, medium height,

35:32.507 --> 35:35.670
dark hair, mustached,
horned-rim glasses.

35:38.913 --> 35:40.938
Miss Malone.

35:41.015 --> 35:43.882
Hi. I'm Bill McDonald.
Is your uncle here? Hi.

35:43.951 --> 35:46.317
No.
Mr. Cathcart was called away.

35:46.387 --> 35:48.651
I'm Thomas Magnum. I'll be
handling this for Miss Malone.

35:48.723 --> 35:52.659
Uh-huh. This is Robert Emery, Mr.
Habib's representative.

35:52.727 --> 35:55.457
I hate to ask you this.
I'm sure you understand.

35:55.530 --> 35:57.828
We can't take any chances.
I need to see some identification.

35:57.899 --> 36:00.800
Of course you do. I think I've got
all the identification you need...

36:00.868 --> 36:03.098
right here in this briefcase.

36:07.341 --> 36:10.071
Here's a bill of sale.

36:11.712 --> 36:15.648
And here is a letter of credit
and a draft for $250,000...

36:15.716 --> 36:17.980
and an export license.

36:20.521 --> 36:24.719
Now, we have to check
Norman's I.D.

36:24.792 --> 36:28.489
Excuse me. Are you the people
selling the horse? Yes.

36:28.563 --> 36:31.054
All right! The tattoo on
the inside of the lip.

36:31.132 --> 36:34.226
Every thoroughbred is given one
when they register them.

36:35.336 --> 36:37.327
Now, would you like to see
the tattoo on my lip?

36:39.040 --> 36:42.874
No, sir. Your secretary described
you when I called the office.

36:42.944 --> 36:46.380
- She's very helpful, Miss Dennis.
- Miss Dennis?

36:46.447 --> 36:48.381
No. My secretary's Nancy York.

36:48.449 --> 36:51.009
Oh. My mistake. I'm sorry.

36:51.085 --> 36:53.576
How about a shot of you
handing the check to the girl?

36:53.654 --> 36:56.555
Instead, why not photograph them
leading the horse into the van?

36:56.624 --> 37:00.822
- After all, they're the champions.
- That's a great idea. How about it?

37:01.896 --> 37:03.864
Sure. Great.

37:03.931 --> 37:06.900
Take that.

37:06.968 --> 37:11.735
Well, Norman, this is it.
No tears now. You're a big boy.

37:11.806 --> 37:14.104
You're a champion.

37:17.845 --> 37:19.779
Okay, that's a great shot
of you and the horse.

37:19.847 --> 37:22.543
Now I want to get all of you.
Okay.

37:28.489 --> 37:30.923
I've got your check
for your fee of $350,

37:30.992 --> 37:33.032
except that in view
of everything that's transpired,

37:33.094 --> 37:35.654
$350 doesn't seem like nearly enough.
Adelaide...

37:35.730 --> 37:39.723
So I'd like to give you
a bonus... $1,000...

37:39.800 --> 37:42.496
if it wouldn't be unprofessional
of you to accept it.

37:47.475 --> 37:49.739
From Peg and Larry. Oh.

37:49.810 --> 37:51.835
Peg and Larry, gracias.
Hi, Uncle Charles.

37:51.913 --> 37:54.677
Adelaide. May I take your order?

37:54.749 --> 37:57.013
Oh, that's all right. Thank you.

37:57.084 --> 38:00.611
We've got our beverage, but we would
appreciate some glasses and ice.

38:00.688 --> 38:03.657
Have a drink, Mr. Magnum,
if your drink is bourbon and water.

38:03.724 --> 38:06.750
No, thank you.
I have the money for Norman,

38:06.827 --> 38:08.795
and I hugged him good-bye
for you.

38:08.863 --> 38:13.391
Mr. Magnum was simply outstanding, the
way he organized and checked everything.

38:15.670 --> 38:18.195
I was beginning to think
it would never happen.

38:19.240 --> 38:21.174
Adelaide, I know...

38:21.242 --> 38:24.473
I know how... Well, you hated
selling that horse. So did I.

38:24.545 --> 38:28.072
But that's why we breed them.
To sell them, right?

38:28.149 --> 38:31.607
Well, this means we'll be able
to raise a lot more, doesn't it?

38:31.686 --> 38:34.917
So I don't really mind...
so very much.

38:37.558 --> 38:39.788
I'm rich, Mr. Magnum. I'm rich.!

38:39.860 --> 38:41.418
Uh...

38:41.495 --> 38:43.855
Mr. Cathcart, there's a Mr.
McDonald outside looking for you.

38:43.864 --> 38:45.855
Oh, yes! Thank you. Excuse me.

38:56.043 --> 38:59.945
Charles, you can celebrate later.
Where's Norman?

39:01.048 --> 39:03.608
What's he talking about?

39:03.684 --> 39:08.121
Adelaide, I think you better hold off
on that bonus for just a minute.

39:11.858 --> 39:15.089
"Private Eye Helps Horsenappers."

39:15.162 --> 39:18.131
Magnum, I had no idea
you took such a good picture.

39:18.198 --> 39:20.132
You're really quite photogenic.

39:20.200 --> 39:23.397
Higgins, Adelaide will be back any
second, so if you don't mind...

39:23.470 --> 39:26.633
Actually, with that overly
aggressive mustache of yours,

39:26.707 --> 39:28.607
you look a bit like Rhett Butler.

39:29.943 --> 39:31.934
Higgins, what...
I'll store this in a safe place...

39:32.012 --> 39:35.243
until I can clip it
and send it on to Robin Masters.

39:35.315 --> 39:36.782
Higgins!

39:36.850 --> 39:40.877
Since Adelaide hired me, I have been beaten
up, blown up and banged on the head.

39:40.954 --> 39:44.754
The police questioned me for six hours
yesterday as a suspect in the case,

39:44.825 --> 39:47.157
and Adelaide's uncle
is threatening me with a lawsuit.

39:47.227 --> 39:49.195
I promise, word of honor,

39:49.263 --> 39:52.027
to obey the rules of the household
without fail for two weeks,

39:52.099 --> 39:54.533
but all I'm asking you, Higgins,

39:54.601 --> 39:57.399
is to answer my damn questions!

39:59.039 --> 40:01.132
I've never heard you
talk that way before.

40:01.208 --> 40:03.904
Higgins, please.

40:06.313 --> 40:09.305
Assuming that there was
a valid contract of sale...

40:09.383 --> 40:11.408
to establish Norman's value,

40:11.485 --> 40:13.419
the answer is yes.

40:13.487 --> 40:16.115
An insurance policy can be written
so that the payoff is determined...

40:16.189 --> 40:20.023
by the fair market value
of the animal at the time of loss,

40:20.093 --> 40:22.584
whether that be theft,
accident, death,

40:22.663 --> 40:25.689
or in Norman's case,
even sterility.

40:27.734 --> 40:29.998
Sterility?

40:30.070 --> 40:32.561
I remember in India,
just before the empire packed it in,

40:32.639 --> 40:36.200
one of our colonels paid a frightful
amount for a stud polo pony.

40:36.276 --> 40:39.871
But when it came time
for the poor animal to produce...

40:41.114 --> 40:43.514
Sterile.

40:43.583 --> 40:45.608
Norman could be sterile.
Oh, yes.

40:45.686 --> 40:48.052
Today's thoroughbreds
from birth are given...

40:48.121 --> 40:50.851
massive doses of vitamins,
hormones, steroids.

40:50.924 --> 40:54.917
We don't know the effects of all
of them, but there are dangers.

40:54.995 --> 40:58.055
Danger of what?

40:59.633 --> 41:03.501
Adelaide,
do you carry sterility insurance?

41:04.504 --> 41:07.132
- What? - On Norman. Do you
carry sterility insurance?

41:07.207 --> 41:09.607
I heard you. No.

41:09.676 --> 41:12.144
But we didn't have to.
Uncle Charles had Norman examined,

41:12.212 --> 41:16.171
and the Arabs even demanded
a... lab specimen.

41:16.249 --> 41:18.547
And I read the report.
It was perfect.

41:18.618 --> 41:20.745
But he could've faked that,
switched the samples.

41:22.189 --> 41:27.559
- Uncle Charles? - Adelaide, this just
didn't feel right from the beginning.

41:27.627 --> 41:31.927
Those cowboys with black hats demanding
extortion money and never setting up a drop.

41:33.900 --> 41:36.425
And that fire.
First I thought it was a diversion,

41:36.503 --> 41:40.064
but it turned out to be at exactly the
same end of the barn as Arabella Hill.

41:40.140 --> 41:42.904
And it spooked him, Adelaide.

41:44.111 --> 41:47.274
You said yourself that's why he gave
his worst performance of the season.

41:49.049 --> 41:51.847
I wanted to win fair and square.

41:51.918 --> 41:53.909
Aw.

41:55.021 --> 41:57.819
I know, Adelaide.

41:57.891 --> 42:01.554
I know you did.
But not your uncle.

42:01.628 --> 42:04.859
He wanted to make sure
Norman was worth the maximum before...

42:04.931 --> 42:08.958
Magnum, you're upsetting
this poor girl for no good reason.

42:09.035 --> 42:14.996
If Norman was sterile, and Cathcart
kidnapped him to collect the insurance,

42:15.075 --> 42:18.272
what could he possibly
have done with the horse?

42:18.345 --> 42:22.543
This island is very small, too small
to hide a horse for very long.

42:22.616 --> 42:25.141
He could only collect
if the animal was...

42:26.720 --> 42:28.711
No.

42:29.823 --> 42:32.348
No, he'd-he'd never kill Norman.

42:37.130 --> 42:39.121
It's okay.

42:40.367 --> 42:42.392
By the time I
got back to the stable,

42:42.469 --> 42:44.630
I was praying I was wrong.

42:44.704 --> 42:49.198
But the more I thought about it,
the more I knew I was right.

42:49.276 --> 42:51.276
Why'd we come back here?
You know the expression...

42:51.344 --> 42:53.278
"" You can't see the forest
for the trees"?

42:53.346 --> 42:56.782
I always thought the best place
to hide a tree was in the forest.

42:56.850 --> 42:59.648
You think Norman's here. Like
Higgins said, it's a small island.

42:59.719 --> 43:03.450
Five-O had roadblocks up 15 minutes
after the horsenappers left.

43:03.523 --> 43:07.482
The only place they hadn't
looked... Was the show grounds.

43:14.367 --> 43:16.767
Norman?

43:16.837 --> 43:18.771
Norman?

43:18.839 --> 43:22.969
Norman!

43:25.045 --> 43:27.036
Norman!

43:28.348 --> 43:30.748
Norman, hello!

43:30.817 --> 43:34.947
Hello. What'd they do to him?

43:35.021 --> 43:37.615
They just died his blaze,
that's all.

43:37.691 --> 43:41.127
Hiya, Norman! How ya doin'?

43:51.037 --> 43:53.335
Uncle Charles! Sorry, Adelaide.

43:53.406 --> 43:56.102
You should've listened to me.
I told you I could handle this.

43:56.176 --> 43:58.804
By killing Norman and
collecting the insurance money?

43:58.879 --> 44:02.178
Norman's sterile, isn't he?
First you faked the lab specimen,

44:02.249 --> 44:05.810
then the extortion threat...
Magnum, you shut up.

44:05.886 --> 44:10.550
I want you to do one thing. just
take that gun out... very easy.

44:12.058 --> 44:15.653
Now. Easy, man.

44:19.900 --> 44:23.199
- You're not gonna kill Norman.
- Adelaide, I have to.

44:23.270 --> 44:25.204
It's the only way
I can get the money.

44:25.272 --> 44:27.934
He's gotta be dead, Adelaide.
Don't you see that?

44:28.942 --> 44:31.570
- Then you kill me too.
- Adelaide, I can't kill you.

44:36.583 --> 44:40.849
I can't kill you! No!

44:44.658 --> 44:47.126
- Adelaide, get the gun!
- I found it!

44:50.363 --> 44:53.764
- Then point it at them!
- Hold it, or I'll blow you to glory.

44:53.833 --> 44:56.461
Her dad taught her to shoot
back in Iowa.

44:56.536 --> 45:00.336
My father did teach me to shoot.
And if they move, I'll kill 'em.

45:00.407 --> 45:02.602
But what about Uncle Charles?

45:06.146 --> 45:08.614
Take the safety off.

45:31.304 --> 45:34.239
Whoa, son. Whoa.

45:35.842 --> 45:38.538
It's all right, Norman.

45:38.612 --> 45:41.445
Whoa.

45:41.514 --> 45:43.505
It's not your fault.

45:45.986 --> 45:48.716
Not your fault at all.

45:48.788 --> 45:50.779
Come on.

45:59.065 --> 46:02.330
Play for the club championship
will begin.

46:05.005 --> 46:07.371
But I don't need to tell you
what's at stake.

46:15.015 --> 46:17.006
Magnum.!

46:18.618 --> 46:21.348
No more distressing news,
I hope.

46:23.223 --> 46:25.657
I paid money for this, you know.

46:25.725 --> 46:28.216
Uh, I would like to win
this tournament.

46:28.294 --> 46:30.762
I'm very apologetic for interrupting,
but I double-parked the van...

46:30.830 --> 46:33.526
with Norman out front,
and the valet is getting very upset.

46:33.600 --> 46:35.966
You'd think by now he knew
me... Adelaide, what...

46:36.036 --> 46:38.732
Well, your check for $350.

46:38.805 --> 46:42.241
Except it's only 100, and my I.O.U.
with interest on the balance,

46:42.308 --> 46:46.108
because I had the extra expense of the van to take
Norman home, because nobody wanted to buy him,

46:46.112 --> 46:49.604
though I'm really relieved
not to lose him... here.

46:52.218 --> 46:54.379
What's my security for the I.O.U.?

46:54.454 --> 46:58.220
Magnum, I'm from Iowa.
You know I'm good for it.

46:59.726 --> 47:01.660
Yeah, I guess you are.

47:03.196 --> 47:05.664
And a terrific smile.
Don't forget that.

47:05.732 --> 47:07.700
Never.

47:09.169 --> 47:11.103
There's just one more thing.

47:11.171 --> 47:13.230
It's rather personal.

47:13.306 --> 47:15.934
Thomas.

47:17.310 --> 47:19.904
In the middle
of a volleyball tournament?

47:21.247 --> 47:23.181
I may never
have the nerve again.

47:23.249 --> 47:25.809
But lately I seem to have
lots of nerve.

47:25.885 --> 47:28.046
Do you remember how surprised
I was when we first met...

47:28.088 --> 47:30.088
and you were standing in the
shower drinking a beer?

47:30.090 --> 47:33.685
Well, it was because Uncle Charles had
warned me that you were a womanizer...

47:33.760 --> 47:35.751
and a bounder and a roué.

47:35.829 --> 47:38.855
A "" roué"?
Well, now I know that...

47:38.932 --> 47:41.332
it was just to keep me
from hiring you.

47:41.401 --> 47:46.998
But the reason I was surprised was because
you had the kindest eyes I'd ever seen.

47:47.073 --> 47:49.906
And now I know you're not...
a roué.

47:49.976 --> 47:51.910
And I...

47:51.978 --> 47:53.969
I'd really appreciate it...

47:55.381 --> 47:58.214
I'd be beholden to you if...

48:18.705 --> 48:23.005
Don't encourage him.!
I'm trying to win this thing.!

48:26.679 --> 48:28.977
The kindest eyes I'd ever seen.

48:29.048 --> 48:31.573
Thomas Magnum,
private investigator.

48:38.324 --> 48:40.258
Begin play.

48:40.326 --> 48:42.726
I guess when I became
a private investigator,

48:42.796 --> 48:46.232
I had my share of fantasies
about beautiful women I'd rescue,

48:46.299 --> 48:50.565
who'd, you know,
be grateful for my services.

48:50.637 --> 48:53.333
Most days aren't like that.

48:53.406 --> 48:56.307
But, well, some days
are better than others.

49:02.348 --> 49:04.339
All right.!
