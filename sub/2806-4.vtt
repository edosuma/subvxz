WEBVTT

00:03.336 --> 00:05.170
We learned one thing, C.H.E.E.S.E:

00:05.422 --> 00:08.924
Cheerleaders and high explosives
don't mix.

00:11.344 --> 00:13.262
You can say that again, Mac.

00:13.513 --> 00:16.015
I couldn't have done it alone.
You're a genius.

00:16.265 --> 00:21.353
Oh, yeah? Well, how come I can't get
my VCR to stop blinking 12:00?

00:28.236 --> 00:29.737
What did you guys think?

00:34.617 --> 00:36.869
- Hey, the phone.
- I got it. I got it.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.412
Hello.

00:38.621 --> 00:40.372
- Hold on. Joey, it's your mom.
- It's Mommy.

00:40.582 --> 00:41.915
- Aw...
- That's nice.

00:42.083 --> 00:44.001
Ma, so what did you think?

00:44.961 --> 00:46.128
Well...

00:46.546 --> 00:48.922
...that was, um, okay.

00:49.174 --> 00:50.507
It wasn't the best.

00:50.717 --> 00:53.218
That was one
of the worst things ever...

00:54.512 --> 00:56.972
...and not just on TV.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.892
- What should we say?
- The lighting was okay.

01:00.143 --> 01:03.228
You got lighting last time.
Lighting is mine.

01:03.688 --> 01:04.730
I have costumes.

01:04.980 --> 01:06.398
That means I'm stuck with:

01:06.649 --> 01:11.779
"So we were watching you in there,
and you were sitting right here. Whoa."

01:12.906 --> 01:14.948
- What about you?
- I don't know.

01:15.200 --> 01:18.494
I can't lie to him again.
Oh, no, I... No.

01:18.745 --> 01:21.497
I'm just gonna press
my breasts up against him.

01:22.874 --> 01:25.084
- And say nothing?
- Uh-huh, yeah, that's right.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.171
Wow, my folks really liked it.

01:29.422 --> 01:30.923
What did you guys think?

01:37.680 --> 01:39.098
It wasn't that good.

02:21.307 --> 02:25.060
Do you think that your favorite animal
says much about you?

02:25.353 --> 02:27.104
You mean behind my back?

02:28.815 --> 02:31.900
Oh, you'll never believe
what happened to me today.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.278
- I am sitting in my office...
- You guys!

02:34.487 --> 02:36.196
Guess what my agent just said?

02:36.447 --> 02:38.157
I'm in the middle of a story here.

02:38.408 --> 02:39.741
Sorry, you finish.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.870
I'm sitting in my office,
and guess who walks in.

02:43.204 --> 02:45.164
I'm gonna be on two TV shows.

02:45.415 --> 02:46.456
That's great.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.376
- Joey.
- You weren't finished?

02:49.627 --> 02:52.337
Yeah, "Guess who walks
into my office" is my story.

02:53.882 --> 02:56.008
Ralph Lauren walked into my office.

02:56.259 --> 02:59.928
Uh, if you're starting another story,
at least let me finish mine.

03:01.222 --> 03:02.723
It's the same story.

03:02.932 --> 03:05.767
Uh, wow, it's really long.

03:06.477 --> 03:10.189
Ralph just came in to tell me
that he's so happy with my work...

03:10.440 --> 03:13.650
...that he wants me to be the new
merchandising manager for Polo retail.

03:13.818 --> 03:14.860
Aw...

03:15.028 --> 03:16.862
- Still get a discount on wedding gowns?
- Yeah.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.197
I'm so happy for you.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.910
These really are
the days of our lives.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.246
- What?
- Well, since you ask, ha, ha...

03:26.497 --> 03:28.373
They want me back on
Days of our Lives.

03:29.751 --> 03:32.085
- I get a big pay raise!
- Oh, hey!

03:32.337 --> 03:34.838
I'll be playing Drake Ramoray's
twin brother, Stryker.

03:35.006 --> 03:36.548
Ooh...

03:36.716 --> 03:38.217
I get to hire my own assistant.

03:39.928 --> 03:43.513
Well... I got a head rush
from standing up too fast.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.146
You were at this job four years?

03:51.397 --> 03:55.442
- That's right.
- This is all very impressive, Hilda.

03:55.610 --> 03:59.363
Um, I just have
one last question for you, uh...

03:59.530 --> 04:01.448
How did I do? Was this okay?

04:02.784 --> 04:04.993
- What?
- I've never interviewed anyone.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.329
I've never had anyone work for me.

04:07.580 --> 04:10.874
When I was a kid we had a maid,
but this isn't the same.

04:11.125 --> 04:13.335
No, dear, it's not.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.420
And I know that.

04:17.130 --> 04:19.257
Well, thank you so much for coming in.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.510
- Nice to meet you.
- Good meeting you.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.136
All right.

04:24.639 --> 04:26.265
I'm a total pro.

04:27.558 --> 04:30.018
- Hello.
- Wow. Huh, um...

04:31.771 --> 04:34.523
Hi, yes, I'm sorry.
The models are down the hall.

04:34.774 --> 04:37.025
I'm here about the assistant job.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.568
Really?

04:39.153 --> 04:42.948
Okay, well, then, all right.
Well, just have a seat there.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.741
Um, so what's...? What your name?

04:45.034 --> 04:46.076
Tag Jones.

04:46.327 --> 04:48.120
Uh-huh, go on.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.290
That's it. That's my whole name.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.583
That's your whole name.
Of course.

04:54.252 --> 04:56.545
Okay, let's just have a look-see here.

04:56.796 --> 05:00.507
I haven't worked in an office before.
I don't have much experience...

05:00.758 --> 05:04.845
What are you talking about?
You got three years painting houses...

05:05.471 --> 05:09.016
...two whole summers
at T.G.I. Friday's.

05:09.726 --> 05:10.934
It's lame, I know.

05:11.185 --> 05:14.021
But I'm a goal-oriented person,
eager to learn...

05:14.230 --> 05:16.189
Just hold on a second, please.

05:20.611 --> 05:23.864
It's for Human Resources. Everybody
has to. Would you stand up?

05:32.165 --> 05:34.249
Ha, ha, no, no, no.

05:45.303 --> 05:46.595
- Hey.
- Shh, shh, shh.

05:51.392 --> 05:54.061
- Anyway, I should go.
- Okay. Bye.

05:54.270 --> 05:56.063
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hi, sweetie.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.357
What was with all the whispering?

05:58.733 --> 06:00.817
I can't tell you. It's a secret.

06:01.235 --> 06:04.821
Secret? Married people aren't
supposed to have secrets.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.699
We love and respect
one another too much.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.534
Aw...

06:09.702 --> 06:11.453
But still, no, ha, ha.

06:11.621 --> 06:15.749
We should tell each other everything.
I don't have secrets from you.

06:15.958 --> 06:20.462
Really? So tell me what happened
to Ross, junior year at Disneyland.

06:20.713 --> 06:21.838
No, I can't do that.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.175
I'll tell you what Phoebe said.

06:25.968 --> 06:27.010
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:27.261 --> 06:29.596
So, ahem, Ross and I
are going to Disneyland.

06:29.847 --> 06:32.015
We stop at this restaurant for tacos.

06:32.266 --> 06:36.895
When I say restaurant, I mean a guy,
a hibachi, and the trunk of his car.

06:37.688 --> 06:39.564
So Ross has about ten tacos.

06:39.816 --> 06:44.361
Anyway, we're on Space Mountain
and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.196
Oh, my God. He threw up?

06:46.447 --> 06:49.408
No, he visited a town
a little south of throw up.

06:50.201 --> 06:52.035
Oh, my God!

06:52.662 --> 06:54.413
What was Phoebe's secret?

06:54.664 --> 06:57.916
Um, Nancy Thompson, from Phoebe's
old massage place, is getting fired.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.167
Oh.

07:02.672 --> 07:05.757
That's it? I gave up
my Disneyland story for that?

07:05.967 --> 07:07.926
Hm, that's right. You lose, sucker!

07:11.264 --> 07:12.889
Please still marry me.

07:16.686 --> 07:18.770
You have an assistant, right?

07:18.938 --> 07:20.063
Did she call?

07:20.231 --> 07:24.109
You told her I was sick, right?
Always tell her I am sick.

07:24.986 --> 07:27.696
I don't know.
How do you decide who to hire?

07:27.905 --> 07:29.614
I have it down to two people.

07:29.866 --> 07:32.909
One has great references
and a lot of experience.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.537
- And then, there's this guy.
- What about him?

07:37.165 --> 07:38.415
I love him.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.294
He's so pretty, I want to cry.

07:42.503 --> 07:43.879
I don't know what to do.

07:44.130 --> 07:47.716
Come on, you know what to do.
You hire the first one.

07:47.925 --> 07:52.596
Don't hire assistants because they're
cute. Do it because they're qualified.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.598
Uh-huh.

07:56.017 --> 08:00.353
I hear you. You make a lot of sense.
Can I just say one more thing?

08:00.605 --> 08:01.813
Look how pretty.

08:03.900 --> 08:04.941
Let me see.

08:05.943 --> 08:07.944
Oh, my God.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.489
Oh. But, no.

08:10.740 --> 08:13.950
No. You can't... You can't hire him
because it's not professional.

08:14.911 --> 08:17.746
Um, this is for me, yes?

08:18.581 --> 08:21.708
Okay, you're right.
I'll hire Hilda tomorrow.

08:21.959 --> 08:24.711
Dumb, old, perfect-for-the-job Hilda.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.546
Let me see.

08:28.549 --> 08:30.467
Wo-ha-ow!

08:30.718 --> 08:32.760
Don't show this to Monica.

08:32.970 --> 08:35.388
And don't tell her
about the "Wo-ha-ow!"

08:42.063 --> 08:44.063
- Ha, ha, hey, Joey.
- Hey, Terry.

08:44.315 --> 08:46.525
- Nice to see you again.
- Been a while.

08:46.734 --> 08:49.569
Funny, these halls look smaller
than they used to.

08:50.279 --> 08:52.155
It's a different building.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.449
So...

08:54.951 --> 08:57.202
...Stryker Ramoray, huh?

08:57.453 --> 08:59.704
- When do I start?
- How about right now?

08:59.956 --> 09:01.331
Okay.

09:01.916 --> 09:04.042
Here are the audition scenes.

09:07.672 --> 09:10.215
I thought you
were offering me the part.

09:10.466 --> 09:11.550
Why?

09:11.759 --> 09:14.177
I was Doctor Drake Ramoray,
Stryker's twin brother.

09:15.555 --> 09:18.056
Who looks more like me
than me, right?

09:18.724 --> 09:21.434
Everybody has to audition. Ha, ha.

09:23.229 --> 09:26.147
You know, Terry,
I don't really need to do this.

09:26.357 --> 09:29.067
I got my own cable TV series...

09:29.360 --> 09:31.528
...with a robot.

09:32.655 --> 09:35.448
I'm sorry, Joey.
That's the way it is.

09:36.325 --> 09:37.617
Well...

09:38.452 --> 09:40.787
...I guess you think
you're pretty special, huh?

09:41.038 --> 09:44.499
Sitting up here in your fancy,
small-halled building...

09:46.127 --> 09:48.587
...making stars jump
through hoops for you, huh?

09:48.838 --> 09:50.338
Well, you know what?

09:52.216 --> 09:55.010
This is one star whose hoop...

09:55.261 --> 09:57.429
This is the star the hoop...
This hoop...

09:57.680 --> 09:59.639
I was Doctor Drake Ramoray!

10:07.315 --> 10:09.858
Hi, Tag. What are you doing here?

10:10.109 --> 10:13.528
I came to thank you for not laughing
in my face yesterday.

10:13.779 --> 10:17.198
I noticed there were no plants
so I brought you your first.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.743
There is a plant in your office.

10:20.578 --> 10:21.953
Kind of.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.705
Right.

10:24.165 --> 10:27.042
So I guess I shouldn't put
"good at noticing stuff" on my résumé.

10:27.209 --> 10:28.251
Oh...

10:28.628 --> 10:30.629
- Thank you.
- Anyway...

10:30.963 --> 10:32.922
...I'm guessing you hired somebody.

10:33.591 --> 10:34.799
Well...

10:35.176 --> 10:36.426
Gotcha.

10:36.844 --> 10:38.928
Thanks again for meeting with me.

10:40.806 --> 10:42.057
But I hired you.

10:44.018 --> 10:46.019
- What?
- Yeah, you got the job.

10:46.228 --> 10:48.229
- You're my new assistant.
- I am?

10:48.481 --> 10:49.898
Yeah.

10:51.025 --> 10:54.361
- I can't believe it.
- Ha, ha, me either.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.448
First, I need you to go downstairs...

10:58.699 --> 11:01.451
...find a woman named Hilda,
and tell her to go home.

11:06.832 --> 11:08.458
- Hey.
- Hey, good, you're home.

11:09.001 --> 11:11.961
Always nicer to hear than,
"Oh, crap, you again."

11:13.756 --> 11:15.882
Hey, sweetie, I made you a surprise.

11:16.133 --> 11:17.967
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, tacos.

11:18.177 --> 11:21.179
Ever since that story,
I've had such a craving.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.308
Did you not understand the story?

11:27.603 --> 11:29.229
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

11:29.397 --> 11:32.816
Ah, nothing. Just figuring out
what to do for dinner.

11:35.444 --> 11:37.612
Hey, ooh, what's that? Dinner stuff?

11:37.780 --> 11:38.822
- You making dinner?
- No.

11:40.324 --> 11:41.366
Shh!

11:43.786 --> 11:45.370
What's over there? Tacos?

11:45.621 --> 11:46.705
No. No.

11:48.582 --> 11:49.874
They're just, uh... They're...

11:50.042 --> 11:52.335
They're ground beef smileys.

11:53.754 --> 11:55.630
Uh, those are tacos.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.383
Excuse me, Mr. Mexico.

11:59.260 --> 12:02.137
Either way, I'll pass.
Still can't eat those.

12:02.304 --> 12:04.097
Ha, ha.

12:10.771 --> 12:12.063
What's so funny?

12:17.945 --> 12:19.529
I'm not laughing.

12:28.289 --> 12:29.956
You told her!

12:31.000 --> 12:32.542
Nancy Thompson's getting fired.

12:36.714 --> 12:40.759
Okay, okay. I had food poisoning.
It's not like I chose to do it!

12:41.010 --> 12:44.888
It's not like I said,
"What would make this ride more fun?"

12:45.890 --> 12:49.684
Right. You're right, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't be laughing.

12:49.935 --> 12:52.312
I should be
laying down papers for you.

12:55.399 --> 12:58.234
- How could you?
- I had to. We're getting married.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.945
Married couples can't keep secrets.

13:01.155 --> 13:04.073
I... I guess Monica should know
about Atlantic City.

13:04.283 --> 13:05.950
Du... ude!

13:06.994 --> 13:09.913
- What happened?
- Chandler and I are in a bar...

13:10.122 --> 13:12.540
Did you not hear me say, "Du... ude"?

13:13.417 --> 13:16.711
- And this girl
is making eyes at Chandler.

13:16.921 --> 13:21.716
So he goes over to her and, uh, after
a minute or two, I see them kissing.

13:22.092 --> 13:26.429
You're thinking he's not the type
to go to bars and make out with girls.

13:26.680 --> 13:28.681
And you're right.
He's not the type...

13:28.933 --> 13:33.061
...to go to bars
and make out with "girls."

13:34.730 --> 13:36.773
You kissed a guy?

13:38.567 --> 13:40.151
Oh, my God!

13:40.361 --> 13:44.572
In my defense, it was dark
and he was a very pretty guy.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.159
Oh, Mon, I laughed so hard...

13:48.327 --> 13:52.539
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out
your underwear again?

13:54.416 --> 13:56.626
Whatever, dude. You kissed a guy.

14:02.424 --> 14:03.800
- Hi.
- Hey.

14:04.051 --> 14:05.760
How's Hilda working out?

14:06.178 --> 14:11.391
Oh, my new assistant
is working out. Yes.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.226
She happy she got the job?

14:13.435 --> 14:18.940
My new assistant is very happy
that I hired my new assistant.

14:21.110 --> 14:22.360
Hello.

14:22.611 --> 14:24.946
Oh, hey! Can you hang on a second?

14:25.155 --> 14:27.240
It's the producers at
Mac and C.H.E.E.S. E...

14:27.408 --> 14:29.325
...if you'll excuse me for a minute.

14:31.078 --> 14:35.498
Hey, funny you should call. I was
just looking over next week's script.

14:36.625 --> 14:38.001
Canceled?

14:39.086 --> 14:41.462
Like, they're taking it off the air? Oh.

14:43.007 --> 14:45.925
All right, I'll see you Monday.

14:46.635 --> 14:48.720
We're not even shooting them anymore!

14:49.722 --> 14:51.973
All right. Bye.

14:53.225 --> 14:54.976
They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.

14:55.144 --> 14:56.936
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh, sorry, Joey.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.939
Why would they do that?
It was a good show, right?

15:12.244 --> 15:14.746
You want to tell secrets?
Okay, in college...

15:14.997 --> 15:17.123
...Ross used to wear leg warmers.

15:18.959 --> 15:24.505
All right, Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice
look-alike contest and won.

15:26.258 --> 15:28.468
Ross came in fourth and cried!

15:28.761 --> 15:30.470
Oh, my God!

15:31.263 --> 15:33.723
Oh, is that funny?
You find that funny?

15:33.933 --> 15:36.809
Maybe Chandler should know
your secrets too.

15:36.977 --> 15:39.270
Ha, ha.
Oh, I... I already told him everything.

15:39.438 --> 15:41.105
You shush!

15:42.066 --> 15:44.359
Once, she was sent to bed
without dinner...

15:44.610 --> 15:47.570
...so she ate the macaroni off
a jewelry box she'd made.

15:50.407 --> 15:54.077
Ross stayed home every Saturday night
to watch Golden Girls.

15:56.538 --> 15:59.165
Monica couldn't tell time
until she was 13.

16:01.293 --> 16:03.503
It's hard for some people!

16:04.254 --> 16:05.922
Of course it is.

16:06.131 --> 16:08.132
Wow.

16:08.592 --> 16:11.678
- Chandler wore my underwear to work!
- Hey!

16:12.888 --> 16:16.474
Oh, I'm sorry, I couldn't think
of any more for Ross.

16:16.767 --> 16:18.476
In college, Chandler got drunk...

16:18.727 --> 16:20.728
...and slept with the lady
who cleaned our dorm.

16:22.523 --> 16:23.564
That was you.

16:26.902 --> 16:28.695
Whatever, dude. You kissed a guy.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.491
How could this happen to me?

16:33.742 --> 16:38.454
Yesterday, I had two TV shows.
Today, I got nothing.

16:38.706 --> 16:41.541
Wait a minute,
what happened to Days of our Lives?

16:41.750 --> 16:44.877
Uh, well, they might be a little mad
at me over there.

16:45.504 --> 16:46.546
What happened?

16:46.797 --> 16:51.968
Well, maybe I got a little upset, and
maybe I told them where they could go.

16:52.469 --> 16:54.679
Joey, why would you do that?

16:54.930 --> 16:57.390
Because! They wanted me to audition.

16:57.599 --> 17:01.019
You, an actor? That's madness!

17:08.484 --> 17:10.319
Rachel Green's office.

17:12.823 --> 17:13.865
Tag.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.575
Hi, who was that?

17:15.951 --> 17:19.078
Nobody. I was just practicing.

17:19.329 --> 17:20.538
Really?

17:26.127 --> 17:29.088
- Hi.
- Hi, Rachel Green's office.

17:30.507 --> 17:32.800
- You must be Hilda.
- Ahem.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.054
He's Tag. This is Phoebe.

17:36.221 --> 17:38.181
- Phoebe, can I see you for a sec?
Mm-hm.

17:38.348 --> 17:39.515
- Phoebe.
Mm-hm.

17:40.017 --> 17:41.851
- Great name.
- You like that?

17:42.061 --> 17:44.729
- You should hear my phone number.
- Okay.

17:50.069 --> 17:53.279
So you hired yourself
a little treat, did you?

17:54.323 --> 17:56.657
I know how it looks,
but I am telling you...

17:56.909 --> 17:59.410
You can't get involved
with your assistant.

17:59.661 --> 18:04.373
I know that, and I know hiring him was
not the smartest thing I've ever done.

18:04.625 --> 18:07.376
But, from now on,
I swear this is strictly professional.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.046
- Yes.
- Hey, Rachel.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.255
Hi.

18:11.507 --> 18:14.050
Cute assistant. What's his story?

18:14.301 --> 18:16.552
- Is he...?
- Gay? Yeah.

18:21.517 --> 18:24.602
Hey, Terry.

18:24.853 --> 18:26.104
Joey Tribbiani.

18:26.313 --> 18:30.024
Surprised your big head
could fit through our small halls.

18:31.151 --> 18:33.361
- I gotta go, Joey.
- Wait, Terry! Look, uh...

18:33.612 --> 18:35.530
I'm really sorry about before.

18:35.781 --> 18:38.991
I was an idiot, thinking I'm too big
to audition for you.

18:39.243 --> 18:41.452
- Give me another chance.
- I can't.

18:41.662 --> 18:43.496
Wait, Terry, please!

18:44.414 --> 18:46.707
Look, I just lost my other job, okay?

18:46.959 --> 18:50.128
You have no idea
how much I need this.

18:50.379 --> 18:51.879
Please, help me out.

18:52.256 --> 18:54.173
For old times' sake.

18:55.467 --> 18:58.803
This guy's been in a coma
for five years. It's hopeless.

18:59.054 --> 19:02.056
It's not. Dr. Stryker Ramoray
is a miracle worker.

19:02.266 --> 19:03.349
Here he comes.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.643
Good morning.

19:11.900 --> 19:16.487
Drake, it's your brother, Stryker.
Can you hear me?

19:16.780 --> 19:18.030
And cut.

19:20.742 --> 19:22.118
I'm back, baby!

19:35.299 --> 19:37.675
You know, in my defense, um...

19:37.926 --> 19:41.512
...there was no glitter on
the macaroni and very little glue.

19:41.972 --> 19:45.516
And in my defense,
the cleaning lady came on to me.

19:46.977 --> 19:49.979
- Do you have trouble telling time now?
- No.

19:50.230 --> 19:52.940
- Quick, what time is it?
- Time to kiss a guy?

19:57.070 --> 19:58.738
What are you laughing at, Pampers?

20:02.242 --> 20:04.285
You know when I said
married people...

20:04.536 --> 20:07.371
...should share everything
and not have any secrets?

20:07.623 --> 20:10.458
- Yeah?
- That was stupid. Let's not do that.

20:10.626 --> 20:11.709
Oh.

20:12.127 --> 20:13.169
Absolutely.

20:13.337 --> 20:17.465
We should keep the stuff we told
each other secret from everyone else.

20:17.716 --> 20:19.550
- Ha, ha.
- Yeah, definitely.

20:20.928 --> 20:22.011
Okay, ha, ha.

20:22.179 --> 20:24.680
If you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna hang out with people...

20:24.848 --> 20:27.350
...who don't know
the Space Mountain story.

20:27.935 --> 20:31.854
- Then I'd steer clear of Phoebe.
- Man!

20:33.398 --> 20:37.818
Not that you would, but I wouldn't
hang out with the guys at my office.

20:48.664 --> 20:49.705
Hi.

20:51.959 --> 20:54.418
- Do you have a minute?
- Sure. What's up?

20:55.087 --> 20:58.506
I got asked out twice today
while I was at lunch...

20:58.757 --> 21:00.466
...by guys.

21:02.844 --> 21:03.970
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.597
Did you tell someone that I was gay?

21:06.807 --> 21:10.142
Oh, did you not want people
to know that?

21:11.478 --> 21:16.190
I'm not gay. I especially wouldn't
want you to think I was gay.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.276
Why is that?

21:20.195 --> 21:23.698
- I don't think I should say.
- Oh, you can say.

21:25.534 --> 21:29.203
Come on, I don't want you to feel
like you can't tell me things.

21:31.915 --> 21:33.082
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:34.084 --> 21:35.918
- Well...
- Yeah.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.671
...I'd love to ask out
your friend Phoebe.

21:41.717 --> 21:43.467
Yeah, she's gay.
