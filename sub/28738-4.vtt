<i>- Previously on</i> The Handmaid's Tale...
- Are you okay? Ow!

00:05.923 --> 00:07.789
I would never have
put you in a new posting.

00:07.883 --> 00:09.875
After what you pulled
at the Mackenzies',

00:09.968 --> 00:11.175
you should be
on the wall!

00:12.971 --> 00:14.531
- Who's the American?
- I am.

00:14.556 --> 00:15.783
The boy
and his mother can go,

00:15.807 --> 00:17.890
but I'm afraid you'll
need a Canadian visa.

00:17.976 --> 00:20.218
<i>When's she gonna
let 'em know that she's here?</i>

00:20.312 --> 00:22.019
- Em?
- Hi.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.312
Is Serena okay?

00:23.398 --> 00:26.311
After what you put
us through, I'm not sure.

00:26.401 --> 00:27.642
You want me
to go back to Fred.

00:27.736 --> 00:30.274
You know there's no place in this world
for you without Fred.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.822
<i>I need you to know
what it was like between us.</i>

00:32.908 --> 00:34.010
<i>A spoiled little girl.</i>

00:34.034 --> 00:35.696
You gave
that baby away.

00:35.786 --> 00:37.573
And it wasn't
even yours.

00:37.663 --> 00:39.074
She isn't mine.

00:39.164 --> 00:41.076
Only a mother could do
what you did.

00:41.166 --> 00:43.704
<i>If you can just think about
all the other mothers</i>

00:43.794 --> 00:46.161
<i>who have had their children
taken away from them.</i>

00:46.255 --> 00:48.247
You have to try harder.

00:48.340 --> 00:49.956
I'm not that
person anymore.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.793
Maybe we're stronger than
we think we are.

01:31.633 --> 01:34.967

Girls, God's Eyes
are upon you.

02:27.564 --> 02:29.305
Best behavior.

02:37.407 --> 02:38.614
Hell on wheels.

02:50.128 --> 02:51.128
Move up!

02:51.213 --> 02:53.453
- Under His eye.
- Under His eye.

02:53.632 --> 02:56.420
Girls,
our most blessed Handmaids

02:56.510 --> 02:58.502
have given us
God's children.

02:58.595 --> 03:01.258
They have earned the best view.

03:02.641 --> 03:04.849
Ofhoward,
stop that nonsense.

03:04.935 --> 03:06.392
I'm sorry, Aunt Lydia.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.136
Praise be.

03:08.230 --> 03:11.519
What a glorious day
for our precious Angela.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.520
I saved a spot
for you up front.

03:16.822 --> 03:18.438
Eyes front.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.273
Next in line.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.575
Ofjoseph. Ofmatthew.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.368
Seats of honor also.

03:24.454 --> 03:25.820
Thank you, Aunt Lydia.

03:26.832 --> 03:27.948
Thank you.

03:29.459 --> 03:30.700
Carry on!

03:32.337 --> 03:33.497
Straight line, girls.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.207
Under His eye.

03:45.183 --> 03:46.299
You had a baby?

03:48.478 --> 03:49.719
Three.

03:52.441 --> 03:54.683
I'm so blessed
to serve Him.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.328
Huh?

04:06.413 --> 04:07.824
Who's my pretty girl, huh?

04:08.457 --> 04:09.664
Hannah banana.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.209
There she is!

04:14.296 --> 04:16.161
- Hi!
- Look at that dress!

04:17.339 --> 04:18.651
You are rocking that dress,
baby girl.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.541
Oh, hello, sweetheart.

04:20.635 --> 04:22.922
My little darling angel.
Yes, you are.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.050
What?

04:25.140 --> 04:27.097
- He missed his train.
- Ugh.

04:27.184 --> 04:28.891
What? Fucking Jerry.

04:28.977 --> 04:31.344
You know, he is the worst
possible choice for godfather.

04:31.438 --> 04:32.832
- Should we just do it without him?
- Mmm-hmm.

04:32.856 --> 04:34.267
Oh, just cancel.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.349
- It's a sign.
- Wh...

04:36.443 --> 04:39.060
Sweetheart, Hannah does not
need to be sanctified

04:39.154 --> 04:41.897
by a bunch of holier-than-thou
child molesters.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.652
Okay, a little louder, Mother.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.511
Do you think that your father would care?

04:45.535 --> 04:47.276
He spent a hell of a lot
more time at Fenway

04:47.370 --> 04:49.032
than he ever did at Mass.

04:49.122 --> 04:52.741
You cannot let religion
control your choices.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.041
That's what they all want.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.789
Mom! Shh!

04:55.879 --> 04:57.165
They are not too thrilled

04:57.255 --> 04:58.462
that I'm the fairy godmother.

04:58.548 --> 04:59.959
Shh.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.541
- Hey!
- Oh.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.627
Oh, boy.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.052
Oh.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.282
- We got one?
- Mmm-hmm.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.784
- That is another sign.
- All right.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.494
Okay. You know what?
You guys don't have to be here.

05:09.518 --> 05:10.725
No, no.
Listen, listen.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.677
We're here.
We're doing this.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.346
You got it, Chief.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.682
Let's baptize
this stinky little sinner.

05:17.776 --> 05:19.045
- I'll take care of her.
- Thank you.

05:19.069 --> 05:20.230
I'll change you.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.527
Oh, I fucking love you.

05:21.613 --> 05:23.007
Thank you, thank you.

05:23.031 --> 05:24.442
Hey, hey, we're gonna
get changed!

05:28.703 --> 05:29.944
Go sit down.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.813
<i>I ought to feel
hatred for this man.</i>

06:07.075 --> 06:08.441
<i>I know I ought to feel it,</i>

06:08.535 --> 06:10.948
<i>but it isn't what I do feel.</i>

06:12.330 --> 06:14.538
<i>What I feel is more
complicated than that.</i>

06:16.459 --> 06:18.542
<i>I don't know what to call it.</i>

06:18.628 --> 06:19.789
<i>It isn't love.</i>

06:32.976 --> 06:35.719
Brothers
and sisters, welcome.

06:36.730 --> 06:40.519
We gather on this sacred day

06:40.609 --> 06:44.068
to thank the Lord
for His greatest gifts.

06:44.154 --> 06:45.520
Come, come,

06:45.614 --> 06:47.526
those He has blessed.

06:47.616 --> 06:49.528
Come up and join us.

07:21.024 --> 07:22.231
He's cute.

07:24.027 --> 07:26.144
They are all
beautiful miracles.

07:26.237 --> 07:27.853
Blessed fathers
and mothers,

07:28.990 --> 07:31.323
by coming before God
and His people,

07:31.409 --> 07:33.742
do you declare your desire

07:33.828 --> 07:37.242
to dedicate yourself
and your child to the Lord?

07:37.332 --> 07:38.868
We do.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.954
June and Luke,
do you accept

07:45.048 --> 07:47.210
the responsibility to
raise your daughter Hannah

07:47.300 --> 07:48.757
in the practice of faith

07:48.843 --> 07:50.505
and to keep God's
commandments

07:50.595 --> 07:52.678
by loving God
and your neighbors?

07:53.598 --> 07:55.555
We do.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.884
And are you ready to help
the parents of this child

07:57.978 --> 08:00.561
in their duties
as Christian parents?

08:00.647 --> 08:03.310
I do. Oh, I mean yes.
I'm ready.

08:05.068 --> 08:06.229
And do you vow

08:06.319 --> 08:08.481
to pray for and encourage
these parents

08:08.571 --> 08:11.359
to raise their children
in the fear of the Lord?

08:12.075 --> 08:13.691
We do.

08:13.785 --> 08:16.152
And do you promise to
encourage these children

08:16.246 --> 08:18.784
to receive His guidance
and instruction?

08:19.457 --> 08:21.244
We do.

08:24.963 --> 08:27.751
I baptize you in
the name of the Father,

08:29.050 --> 08:30.257
and of the Son,

08:31.386 --> 08:32.751
and of the Holy Spirit.

08:36.808 --> 08:38.174
There you go.

08:44.482 --> 08:46.269
- You did it!
- She did good.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.941
So good.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.213
I mean, she is
my goddaughter, so...

08:49.237 --> 08:50.237
Yes.

08:51.448 --> 08:52.484
Today,

08:53.950 --> 08:55.532
we are grateful to God

08:55.618 --> 08:56.984
for these beautiful children.

08:59.748 --> 09:02.161
But we must never forget

09:02.250 --> 09:04.367
the innocent child
that was stolen from us.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.624
A Daughter of Gilead,

09:07.714 --> 09:09.000
taken by evil.

09:09.966 --> 09:12.003
By an unrepentant sinner.

09:14.971 --> 09:17.964
Let us hold that
blessed child in our prayers.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.682
And may the Lord protect her

09:21.686 --> 09:22.972
and keep her safe.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.396
Amen.

09:25.482 --> 09:26.768
Amen.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.040
<i>Attention customers
on Line Two,</i>

09:37.118 --> 09:39.656
<i>we are currently experiencing
longer than normal delays</i>

09:39.746 --> 09:42.363
<i>between St. George
and Broadview Station.</i>

10:33.466 --> 10:35.583
I'm so sorry.
I couldn't find a space.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.043
It's okay.

11:14.257 --> 11:15.919
You have something to say?

11:18.678 --> 11:21.045
Just wondering how you
were feeling, Aunt Lydia.

11:22.765 --> 11:23.801
Long day.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.558
Wouldn't want you
to overdo it.

11:28.980 --> 11:31.597
You best be concerned
with yourself today.

11:34.652 --> 11:37.690
The Commander and Mrs. Putnam
have been exceedingly generous

11:37.780 --> 11:39.772
to invite you all
to the reception.

11:40.992 --> 11:43.200
I can't wait to see her.

11:43.286 --> 11:46.404
Ofhoward, I expect you
to be what?

11:47.165 --> 11:48.372
A good girl.

11:50.335 --> 11:51.667
Make me proud.

12:06.684 --> 12:08.300
I can manage, thank you.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.366
I'm so glad
you're here.

12:24.452 --> 12:25.693
I hope that you're hungry.

12:25.787 --> 12:28.495
Oh, praise be.
Blessed day.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.374
Blessed day.
Please, come in.

12:36.464 --> 12:39.582
Such an honor for these girls
to be here, Mrs. Putnam.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.383
Praise be to Him and
those who serve Him.

12:41.469 --> 12:42.926
Praise be.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.219
Praise be.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.013
I'll never forget
what you did for Angela.

12:54.732 --> 12:55.813
She wouldn't be here,

12:55.900 --> 12:58.688
if you hadn't been
on that bridge that day.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.646
Blessings on you and
your family, Mrs. Putnam.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.116
Bless you.

13:11.082 --> 13:12.163
Bless you, too.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.917
Please make yourselves
comfortable.

13:17.755 --> 13:18.755
Ah.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.916
Oh. In there.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.877
Oh! Of course.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.087
Thank you.

13:28.599 --> 13:30.511
Handmaids
shouldn't be here.

13:30.601 --> 13:32.718
It's not how it works.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.394
Lighten up.
Go eat something.

14:10.433 --> 14:11.719
Have I
missed anything?

14:18.649 --> 14:19.765
Just the usual.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.610
Jell-O shots. Charades.

14:24.322 --> 14:25.483
Little karaoke.

14:29.952 --> 14:31.864
I didn't see you
at the Dedication.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.033
I'd hate to be
a distraction.

14:43.299 --> 14:45.461
They might surprise you,
you know.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.467
They respect you.

14:52.433 --> 14:54.720
They looked to you
once before

14:55.728 --> 14:57.560
to lead them.

14:57.647 --> 14:59.479
Half of them
walked out on me.

15:01.275 --> 15:02.516
Half of them didn't.

15:12.954 --> 15:14.070
Do you regret it?

15:14.747 --> 15:16.329
Not leaving here?

15:17.458 --> 15:18.539
Not without Hannah.

15:21.671 --> 15:24.288
At least there's still
hope if I'm here.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.170
I may get
to see her again.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.387
I can't say the same
for Nichole.

15:54.412 --> 15:55.412
Serena.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.071
Fred.

16:00.751 --> 16:03.664
I'm glad you
decided to come.

16:03.754 --> 16:04.995
For Naomi.

16:07.258 --> 16:08.749
Yes, well...

16:09.760 --> 16:11.342
She'll be happy
you're here.

16:14.223 --> 16:15.885
Ofjoseph. Blessed day.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.591
Blessed day,
Commander Waterford.

16:19.562 --> 16:20.598
Shall we?

16:28.779 --> 16:30.566
Serena.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.022
Thank you
so much for coming.

16:32.116 --> 16:33.232
I wouldn't miss it.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.886
Sure you're not hungry?

17:43.980 --> 17:45.642
I made pasta salad.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.727
Maybe later.

17:54.282 --> 17:57.821
Oh, and I got that weird tea
you like for breakfast.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.492
The one that
tastes like dirt.

18:01.080 --> 18:04.323
I saw you get breakfast
at the hotel.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.374
I don't want to make things
awkward for you.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.040
It is awkward.

18:13.009 --> 18:14.625
But who cares?

18:17.763 --> 18:19.880
What time does
he get dropped off?

18:20.891 --> 18:22.803
Soon.

18:22.893 --> 18:25.510
You know, he begged to stay
home from school today,

18:25.605 --> 18:28.894
but I figured you might need a minute
to catch your breath.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.442
But I prepped Ms. Currie,
she knows you're coming.

18:33.529 --> 18:34.895
Ms. Currie?

18:34.989 --> 18:36.981
Sorry. His teacher.

18:38.034 --> 18:39.491
He has a little
crush on her.

18:49.003 --> 18:50.210
Does Oliver...

18:51.172 --> 18:52.172
What?

18:55.092 --> 18:56.208
Remember?

19:31.837 --> 19:34.796
That's you.
Fighting to get back home.

19:46.686 --> 19:47.972
Mom?

19:49.021 --> 19:50.478
Hey, buddy.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.476
Here. Come here.
Come here.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.646
It's okay, honey.

19:55.736 --> 19:57.853
- You can say hi.
- Hi.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.654
Hi.

19:59.740 --> 20:02.403
I'm not supposed to hug you
till you're ready.

20:04.829 --> 20:06.866
Well, how about
we don't hug

20:06.956 --> 20:08.322
until we're both ready?

20:08.416 --> 20:10.703
- That be okay?
- Yeah.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.077
I'm so happy to see you.

20:14.964 --> 20:16.751
I missed you so much.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.542
How was school?

20:19.635 --> 20:21.547
Good. We had
science today.

20:21.637 --> 20:24.050
We're doing fossils.
Wanna see?

20:24.640 --> 20:26.882
Wait. You have fossils
in there?

20:26.976 --> 20:28.638
I drew some.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.970
Okay. Let me see.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.267
Show me.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.283
He's so big.

20:49.832 --> 20:51.289
I know.

21:48.766 --> 21:50.382
I figured
you'd like it plain.

21:51.685 --> 21:53.267
Oh!

21:53.354 --> 21:54.595
Aren't you a dear.

21:56.899 --> 21:58.856
They also have some of
those little macaroons.

21:58.943 --> 22:00.104
I can get you some.

22:01.362 --> 22:02.728
Too sweet.

22:03.572 --> 22:04.572
Thank you.

22:08.744 --> 22:09.860
Mmm.

22:12.915 --> 22:14.076
Aunt Lydia?

22:14.667 --> 22:16.329
Um...

22:16.418 --> 22:19.001
I'm really sorry about
what happened to you.

22:19.088 --> 22:21.626
I prayed...
I prayed so hard

22:21.715 --> 22:23.456
when I found out,
for you to get better.

22:24.218 --> 22:25.218
We all did.

22:26.387 --> 22:28.845
Well, I'm sure.

22:29.765 --> 22:31.802
No. Really.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.140
I know what the girls
think of me.

22:40.276 --> 22:42.063
And they blame me for Emily.

22:44.321 --> 22:47.234
I should never have saved her
from The Colonies.

22:49.952 --> 22:52.035
I'm... I'm glad
you saved me.

22:54.206 --> 22:55.242
Me, too.

23:03.966 --> 23:05.082
So messed up.

23:05.426 --> 23:06.633
That's Janine.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.130
At least spike it.

23:10.180 --> 23:11.921
Aunt Lydia's
doing her job.

23:13.100 --> 23:14.466
She's doing her best.

23:15.352 --> 23:16.433
Her best?

23:16.979 --> 23:18.811
Did she burn you, Breeder?

23:18.898 --> 23:20.514
You can't blame
Aunt Lydia for that.

23:23.777 --> 23:25.297
We're all trying to
make it through this

23:25.321 --> 23:26.983
without making any trouble.

23:41.795 --> 23:42.795
Hello, girls.

23:45.549 --> 23:46.756
Am I interrupting?

23:47.509 --> 23:48.590
No, sir.

23:52.681 --> 23:55.344
Have you girls
tried the buffet?

23:55.601 --> 23:57.467
The deviled eggs
are delicious.

23:59.563 --> 24:01.805
Go on.
Before you miss out.

24:16.705 --> 24:18.617
You know we can't eat
from the buffet.

24:20.042 --> 24:21.658
I'll handle
the complaints.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.260
I'm

24:39.853 --> 24:41.719
concerned about Serena.

24:42.731 --> 24:44.222
She's been

24:46.193 --> 24:48.276
having a difficult time.

24:54.243 --> 24:55.529
That's understandable.

24:56.745 --> 24:58.987
It's been challenging
for both of us.

25:00.249 --> 25:01.660
So many changes.

25:03.794 --> 25:06.537
But it's time to get on
with things. Together.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.628
Is that what you want?

25:13.178 --> 25:14.178
Of course.

25:14.263 --> 25:15.379
She's my wife.

25:19.977 --> 25:21.513
Is that
what your wife wants?

25:27.943 --> 25:29.229
Hard to know.

25:30.112 --> 25:31.899
She hasn't been very

25:32.823 --> 25:34.189
forthcoming.

25:35.242 --> 25:36.949
You know how
she can be. So...

25:39.747 --> 25:40.863
Stubborn.

25:44.668 --> 25:45.668
Yeah.

25:48.088 --> 25:50.000
But she can't keep hiding
at her mother's.

25:54.011 --> 25:55.422
I don't think she's

25:57.222 --> 25:58.588
satisfied

25:59.892 --> 26:02.760
planting flowers
and knitting sweaters.

26:05.939 --> 26:07.601
Not sure she ever was.

26:10.402 --> 26:11.609
Sir.

26:17.993 --> 26:21.862
So, do you think you could
be open to change?

26:24.124 --> 26:27.208
Could you maybe give her
a real voice?

26:28.462 --> 26:29.748
Behind the scenes,

26:31.465 --> 26:32.546
of course.

26:38.806 --> 26:40.092
Well, if that would

26:43.143 --> 26:44.475
fix things.

26:48.148 --> 26:50.891
- It's worth discussing.
- Yeah.

26:50.984 --> 26:53.271
But she hasn't said
more than two words to me.

27:00.577 --> 27:04.116
I should get back
to the buffet.

27:04.206 --> 27:05.287
Hmm.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.877
Check on those
deviled eggs.

27:55.591 --> 27:56.752
Wow.

28:27.831 --> 28:29.038
What is it?

28:31.919 --> 28:33.911
The Commander
wants to reconcile.

28:36.673 --> 28:38.539
He wants
to make things right,

28:38.634 --> 28:39.861
but he doesn't know
how to do it,

28:39.885 --> 28:42.218
so I made a suggestion.

28:49.353 --> 28:50.560
More freedom.

28:52.189 --> 28:53.430
In your marriage.

28:57.527 --> 28:58.734
To do what?

29:02.824 --> 29:05.066
As Mrs. Waterford,
you have influence.

29:06.578 --> 29:07.739
Access.

29:10.249 --> 29:11.410
Power.

29:13.293 --> 29:14.704
Up to a point.

29:15.545 --> 29:17.081
So move the point.

29:21.051 --> 29:22.758
Like we did before.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.889
He is lost without you,
Serena.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.407
Wear the dress.

29:50.956 --> 29:52.492
Pull the strings.

31:19.086 --> 31:20.952
You have to sign this.

31:21.046 --> 31:22.332
Hmm?

31:22.422 --> 31:26.211
Another field trip?
Are you guys ever in school?

31:26.301 --> 31:27.542
Yes.

31:30.347 --> 31:31.508
Hey.

31:35.143 --> 31:37.476
Okay, bud. Bed.

31:38.146 --> 31:39.603
I need water.

31:39.689 --> 31:42.147
- You've already had.
- I'm still thirsty.

31:42.234 --> 31:43.975
Yeah, but if
you drink water now,

31:44.069 --> 31:46.231
you're gonna be up
to pee in an hour.

31:46.321 --> 31:48.779
- Mom!
- What?

31:48.865 --> 31:50.231
She knows you pee.

31:50.325 --> 31:51.941
Everybody pees.

31:54.287 --> 31:56.324
- You want dinosaurs?
- Yeah!

31:56.415 --> 31:57.576
Okay. Get in.

32:00.001 --> 32:01.583
All right. Scoot.

32:01.670 --> 32:03.662
All right,
where did we leave off?

32:03.755 --> 32:06.748
- Spinosaurus.
- Wait.

32:06.842 --> 32:08.708
Will you read it to me?

32:13.682 --> 32:14.968
Um...

32:16.601 --> 32:18.058
Sure?

32:20.564 --> 32:22.430
Spinosaurus. Cool.

32:28.280 --> 32:32.741
"Spinosaurus was the largest
of all meat-eating dinosaurs.

32:32.826 --> 32:34.988
"It may have grown
to 50-feet long.

32:39.666 --> 32:43.785
"New discoveries suggest another
of Spinosaurus' special qualities.

32:45.630 --> 32:47.622
"With its powerful arms...

32:50.469 --> 32:52.927
"Spinosaurus may have
moved about on all fours.

33:02.939 --> 33:05.352
"With its smooth teeth..."

33:09.571 --> 33:12.154
Want me to?

33:12.240 --> 33:15.153
"With its smooth teeth
and long narrow jaws,

33:15.243 --> 33:19.704
"Spinosaurus was better
suited to catching fish,

33:19.789 --> 33:21.325
"than hunting land animals."

33:22.626 --> 33:24.583
"Spinosaurus lived
in a swampy forest..."

33:45.690 --> 33:47.306
Serena. How are you?

33:47.400 --> 33:48.481
Blessed day.

33:48.568 --> 33:50.355
Grace.
Blessed evening.

33:56.451 --> 33:58.784
- Look who's awake.
- Oh!

33:58.870 --> 34:01.112
Hello, sweet face.

34:01.206 --> 34:02.868
What a darling.

34:04.167 --> 34:05.783
Oh!

34:05.877 --> 34:07.368
She's so curious
about everything.

34:12.217 --> 34:14.708
- Smart girls are trouble.
- Yeah. Tell me about it.

34:24.813 --> 34:26.145
Serena.

34:29.317 --> 34:30.558
Take her.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.029
Oh, she's such
a treasure.

34:36.116 --> 34:37.652
Shh.

34:37.742 --> 34:41.076
- Praise be.
- Praise be.

34:41.161 --> 34:42.572
I'm very
happy for you.

34:42.664 --> 34:44.583
- Praise be.
- Really?

34:47.710 --> 34:48.792
Janine.

34:49.379 --> 34:50.379
No.

35:03.351 --> 35:06.435
Hi. You're so beautiful.

35:10.233 --> 35:11.233
Hi.

35:15.822 --> 35:17.438
Can I hold her?

35:18.283 --> 35:19.865
I think that's enough.

35:22.662 --> 35:23.869
Wait.

35:25.081 --> 35:27.323
The Lord is gracious
and righteous.

35:28.501 --> 35:30.413
Our God is full of compassion.

35:32.213 --> 35:33.329
Hi.

35:35.175 --> 35:36.461
Hi.

35:40.180 --> 35:42.888
It's okay.

35:46.519 --> 35:49.011
Sweet angel.

36:04.037 --> 36:05.073
Thank you.

36:07.582 --> 36:08.868
You're welcome.

36:15.131 --> 36:17.373
Commander and Mrs. Putnam...

36:19.552 --> 36:22.169
Angela is so lucky
to have you as her parents.

36:23.848 --> 36:25.760
- By God's grace.
- By God's grace.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.341
Yes.

36:27.435 --> 36:28.892
By God's grace,

36:30.522 --> 36:32.104
she could have
a little brother.

36:32.857 --> 36:34.098
What?

36:34.192 --> 36:35.353
Or sister.

36:35.860 --> 36:37.396
Ofhoward!

36:37.487 --> 36:39.979
Ofwarren. I wanna
be your Handmaid again.

36:40.073 --> 36:41.913
- Okay. Come on.
- No. But, but, why?

36:41.950 --> 36:43.177
- It's time to go.
- I just wanna do God's work.

36:43.201 --> 36:45.033
I wanna do it. Isn't that
what you taught me?

36:46.037 --> 36:47.448
Isn't that what
you all want?

36:47.539 --> 36:49.246
Mind your tongue!

36:49.332 --> 36:50.914
I just... I wanna be here.

36:51.167 --> 36:53.830
I can make them
a good one again! I can...

36:53.920 --> 36:56.037
I just wanna be
with my daughter.

36:57.632 --> 36:59.248
- Aunt Lydia...
- No!

37:01.219 --> 37:03.364
- I just wanna give them a baby.
- Don't! Janine!

37:03.388 --> 37:04.970
Oh, my God.

37:05.056 --> 37:06.117
Stop her!

37:06.141 --> 37:07.473
Stupid girl!

37:07.559 --> 37:09.425
- Stop her!
- Stupid! Stupid!

37:09.519 --> 37:10.519
No! Stop it!

37:10.603 --> 37:11.764
Aunt Lydia!

37:11.855 --> 37:13.642
Stop it! Stop!

37:13.732 --> 37:15.598
No! No!

37:21.322 --> 37:23.234
Get her out of here.

37:44.554 --> 37:45.554
What?

38:06.159 --> 38:07.741
My deepest apologies.

38:17.003 --> 38:18.003
I...

38:21.966 --> 38:23.207
I...

38:28.890 --> 38:30.927
Mmm. Right.

39:58.938 --> 40:00.054
Aren't you cold?

40:02.108 --> 40:03.394
Yeah.

40:03.985 --> 40:05.317
But I like it.

40:09.324 --> 40:11.907
You doing okay?
Do you need anything?

40:12.911 --> 40:14.322
No, I'm good, thanks.

40:20.293 --> 40:23.127
I think I'll head
to the hotel.

40:23.212 --> 40:24.373
Check in.

40:26.633 --> 40:27.633
Okay.

40:34.682 --> 40:36.218
I'll stay for
a little while.

41:07.799 --> 41:10.257
Thank you for coming.
Go in grace.

41:10.343 --> 41:11.754
Go in grace.

41:13.554 --> 41:15.841
Is she okay?

41:15.932 --> 41:17.423
She's been through worse.

41:17.517 --> 41:19.053
Blessed be.
Thank you.

41:21.312 --> 41:23.053
That's what you get.

41:23.147 --> 41:25.059
Thank you.

41:25.149 --> 41:26.685
May the Lord bless you.

41:27.568 --> 41:29.150
Under His eye.

41:29.237 --> 41:30.523
Thank you for coming.

41:30.613 --> 41:32.070
- Go in grace.
- Go in grace.

41:34.200 --> 41:35.486
Go in grace.

41:36.494 --> 41:39.783
I want to talk to you.

41:47.714 --> 41:50.001
That's not the way
the party should have ended.

41:52.260 --> 41:53.626
Poor Naomi.

41:54.178 --> 41:55.544
Poor Naomi?

41:58.558 --> 42:00.238
It's terrible, of course,
for both of them.

42:00.309 --> 42:03.052
And that is exactly
why the system was designed,

42:03.146 --> 42:05.138
to prevent this kind of thing
from happening.

42:05.231 --> 42:08.144
I'm sorry, Mrs. Waterford,
they're probably waiting for me.

42:24.167 --> 42:26.409
A young girl
of Hannah's age,

42:26.502 --> 42:27.913
the daughter
of a Commander,

42:28.004 --> 42:31.748
would most likely attend
a school for domestic arts.

42:35.011 --> 42:38.345
The one in her district is in Brookline,
by the reservoir.

42:42.185 --> 42:44.393
The girls play outside
after lunch.

42:46.355 --> 42:48.392
Perhaps you'll find a way
to see her.

42:53.112 --> 42:54.478
Thank you, S...

43:12.256 --> 43:14.464
- Quick change.
- Uh-huh.

43:14.550 --> 43:16.542
Too bad she can't wear
that dress again, huh?

43:16.636 --> 43:18.002
- I know.
- There you go.

43:18.096 --> 43:19.883
What are we gonna do with it?

43:19.972 --> 43:21.759
- Huh?
- Good girl. Where'd they go?

43:21.849 --> 43:24.057
Oh, they're outside,
debating restaurant options.

43:24.143 --> 43:26.260
Your mother is
insisting on vegan.

43:26.354 --> 43:28.846
Jesus. She's not even
a fucking vegan.

43:28.940 --> 43:30.397
What is it?

43:31.317 --> 43:33.934
Oh, man,
I'm so glad we did this.

43:34.028 --> 43:35.894
You know, we're so lucky
to have her,

43:35.988 --> 43:38.150
you know, the way that
things are nowadays?

43:38.241 --> 43:39.857
And she's happy,
and she's healthy.

43:39.951 --> 43:42.318
- And it's just like, why not?
- Mmm-hmm.

43:42.411 --> 43:43.411
Just in case.

43:43.496 --> 43:46.159
Like buying insurance, yeah.

43:46.249 --> 43:48.582
But, seriously, I think...

43:48.668 --> 43:53.754
I think today was important
to say "Thank you" to God.

43:54.757 --> 43:56.168
- You know?
- Yeah.

43:57.385 --> 43:59.172
- Me, too.
- Yeah.

44:03.933 --> 44:05.219
I love you.

44:05.309 --> 44:07.016
I love you.

44:11.023 --> 44:12.810
And we are going to choose
where we eat.

44:12.900 --> 44:14.061
Hell, yeah.

44:14.152 --> 44:16.235
You know why?
Because today is our day.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.401
- Yeah.
- Okay?

44:17.488 --> 44:18.882
But... But you're telling
your mom, though.

44:18.906 --> 44:20.634
Oh, yeah. I'm telling her.
You're not telling her.

44:20.658 --> 44:21.990
Yeah, uh-huh.

44:30.293 --> 44:31.937
I need to speak
with Commander Waterford.

44:31.961 --> 44:33.452
Is there a problem?

44:33.546 --> 44:35.208
Can you take me
to him, sir?

45:13.419 --> 45:15.957
<i>Chi-town,
we're with you!</i>

45:16.047 --> 45:17.583
When was this posted?

45:17.673 --> 45:19.084
Within 24 hours.

45:22.803 --> 45:23.803
Wait.

45:26.849 --> 45:28.340
That your Handmaid, sir?

45:29.977 --> 45:31.468
Former Handmaid.

45:32.396 --> 45:33.432
Come.

45:38.486 --> 45:40.728
Excuse me, sir. We need
to confirm who he is.

45:46.494 --> 45:48.235
<i>Chi-town,
we're with you!</i>

45:49.538 --> 45:51.621
<i>We stand with Chicago!</i>

45:52.833 --> 45:54.620
<i>Chi-town, we're with you!</i>

45:56.379 --> 45:57.836
<i>We stand with Chicago!</i>

46:00.091 --> 46:01.798
<i>Chi-town, we're with you!</i>

46:03.344 --> 46:04.926
<i>We stand with Chicago!</i>

46:06.430 --> 46:09.343
<i>- Hi, baby!
- Baby's first protest!</i>

46:09.433 --> 46:11.595
<i>She's so sweet.</i>

46:11.686 --> 46:13.427
<i>- What's her name?
- Nichole.</i>

46:13.521 --> 46:15.558
<i>- Oh!
- Chi-town, we're with you!</i>

46:15.648 --> 46:17.139
You know that man?

46:17.233 --> 46:19.350
<i>We stand with Chicago!</i>

46:20.945 --> 46:22.732
<i>- Chi-town, we're with you!</i>
- Yes.

46:24.156 --> 46:25.613
<i>We stand with Chicago!</i>

46:25.700 --> 46:28.033
His name?

46:28.119 --> 46:31.453
<i>You're a protester,
aren't you, huh? Yeah.</i>

46:31.539 --> 46:32.780
Is it Lucas Bankole?

46:35.001 --> 46:36.583
<i>Chi-town,
we're with you!</i>

46:39.130 --> 46:40.792
<i>We stand with Chicago!</i>

46:42.008 --> 46:43.340
<i>Chi-town, we're with you!</i>

46:45.428 --> 46:47.670
<i>- We stand with Chicago!</i>
- Yes.

46:48.848 --> 46:50.635
<i>Chi-town,
we're with you!</i>

47:01.402 --> 47:04.736
<i>She's like her mom.
Lots of attitude.</i>

47:11.954 --> 47:13.661
Let me see that again.

47:17.043 --> 47:19.126
<i>We stand with Chicago!</i>

47:19.211 --> 47:21.453
<i>Chi-town, we're with you!</i>

47:21.547 --> 47:23.288
She's gotten so big.

47:23.382 --> 47:25.499
<i>We stand with Chicago!</i>

47:27.178 --> 47:28.919
<i>Chi-town, we're with you!</i>

47:30.639 --> 47:32.676
<i>We stand with Chicago!</i>

47:34.185 --> 47:35.972
<i>Chi-town, we're with you!</i>

47:37.605 --> 47:39.642
<i>We stand with Chicago!</i>

47:41.192 --> 47:43.104
<i>Chi-town, we're with you!</i>

47:44.779 --> 47:46.691
<i>We stand with Chicago!</i>

48:04.465 --> 48:05.876
Yeah, um...

48:07.093 --> 48:08.584
We're not her parents.

48:08.677 --> 48:10.213
We're like godparents.

48:10.304 --> 48:11.761
Right. Well...

48:11.847 --> 48:13.679
Her mother is my wife.

48:13.891 --> 48:15.007
And my best friend.

48:15.101 --> 48:17.514
And she'd really
want us to do this.

48:18.813 --> 48:20.349
Where is the mother?

48:24.944 --> 48:26.435
She's in Gilead.

48:30.199 --> 48:32.612
This little one should be
absolved of their sins.

48:38.082 --> 48:41.166
I baptize you
in the name of the Father,

48:45.339 --> 48:47.046
and of the Son,

48:49.802 --> 48:51.384
and the Holy Spirit.

48:53.347 --> 48:55.634
- Amen.
- Amen.

48:59.478 --> 49:01.140
You did it. Thank you.

49:03.566 --> 49:04.852
You did it.

49:06.610 --> 49:07.726
Go in peace.
