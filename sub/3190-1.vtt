I have not been to six universities
studied to be called Mr, Millan,

07:26.487 --> 07:31.149
Professor Millan, we think
we more working formulas have-

07:31.285 --> 07:38.449
which can be thought
predict and influence them,

07:40.918 --> 07:47.288
Mind Control?

07:50.052 --> 07:53.387
Mind Control?
- Yes,

07:54.307 --> 07:56.880
This is not only
a dead end,

07:57.019 --> 08:01.810
But I expect one more realistic
project of my students,

08:01.939 --> 08:08.228
We have only a little more
equipment necessary for research,

08:08.362 --> 08:12.490
We wondered, or hoped,

08:12.992 --> 08:18.367

08:49.403 --> 08:53.354
I want to help as much as possible,

08:53.491 --> 08:56.611
But I can such projects
not finance,

08:57.078 --> 09:03.793
You sit in the top 10%, There
you would benefit from them,

09:04.126 --> 09:09.667
But we need your approval
needed to get started,

09:09.799 --> 09:17.048
When the next budget round
could think of us?

09:17.182 --> 09:21.096
Then we talk it down,
- Good idea, I could do that,

09:21.227 --> 09:28.357

10:54.904 --> 11:01.109
And what to do now? Fuck,
That may sound wrong,

11:01.245 --> 11:05.573
Girls fuck until you find one

12:57.235 --> 13:01.102

home, I'm going after her,

22:18.838 --> 22:23.584
Come back here, Arguing
about the same, five, six times,

22:23.719 --> 22:26.803
Goodness,
- They must be mature,

22:26.930 --> 22:33.384
As a consolation:T,J, and I had
another great night,

22:33.519 --> 22:38.727
You and the teacher, You see each other
billions of times this month,

22:38.858 --> 22:40.482
30 billion and once,

22:40.611 --> 22:45.438
If you do not play golf, you're going
the film or antiquarian,

22:45.574 --> 22:52.822
I see sides of you I never
seen, You playboy, Go away,

22:52.955 --> 22:56.871
Stop, Continue,
- All right, go ahead,

22:57.251 --> 23:01.380
Did not know we had milk,
- You must be dehydrated,

23:01.507 --> 23:07.378
Is that almond milk?
- Lee? What are you doing?

23:20.858 --> 23:27.395
Lee! What are you doing?
- I create a snake-friendly environment,

23:27.531 --> 23:32.527
And if I play Jason Mraz,
then the right,

23:32.663 --> 23:37.075
Snakes love Jason Mraz,
- Time for me to go,

23:46.343 --> 23:48.050
Lots of fun,

23:48.761 --> 23:55.844
Thanks again for the food,
- I find it to be fine with you,

23:57.604 --> 24:02.230
You know, we do this for a while now,

24:02.358 --> 24:07.898
And I thought ,,,
You do know that ,,,

24:10.826 --> 24:16.329
Maybe we can officially ,,,
- Listen, Quinn,

24:19.209 --> 24:23.917
Okay, I do not want you
give the wrong impression,

24:24.006 --> 24:30.210
I like to go with you
and I'm glad I met you,

24:30.345 --> 24:34.674
But I am at the moment
not looking for anything serious,

24:35.017 --> 24:39.559
I am now in the friend zone?

24:39.645 --> 24:45.434
This is not the right time,
- It's a terrible time,

24:45.568 --> 24:49.019
You are a giant guy,
- You're a fine fellow,

24:49.155 --> 24:54.067
I see you as a good friend,
- Yes, friend,

24:54.202 --> 25:02.078
It's not the right time,
- You know, I think you're cute,

25:02.211 --> 25:07.632
It should not feel uncomfortable,
- I do not have feelings at all,

25:08.508 --> 25:13.051
You know, So ,,,
- I'm sorry I encouraged you,

25:13.180 --> 25:18.767
No no no,
Do not be silly,

25:18.894 --> 25:22.558
Do not be silly, Do not,

25:23.065 --> 25:30.395
You decide how to proceed,
- It's okay,

25:30.530 --> 25:34.314
I'm cool, you're cool,
We are cool,

25:34.451 --> 25:41.747
Great, but now I have to
off, Thanks for the food,

25:41.875 --> 25:46.537
Thank you, Hug,

25:50.592 --> 25:52.170
Shit,

25:53.427 --> 25:58.055
Hello Friend,
I saw what happened,

25:58.182 --> 25:59.760
I sat in the bushes,

25:59.893 --> 26:04.354
I just want to say
what you mean to me,

26:04.480 --> 26:09.476
As I stood there,
I googled how to comfort a friend,

26:09.611 --> 26:14.238
And the first thing you say is:
"I am your friend,"

26:14.365 --> 26:18.613
And the second?
- The second is ,,,

26:19.078 --> 26:24.665
"I'm always ready for you,"
And then:"You are not alone,"

26:24.792 --> 26:29.788
You do not want her, She has narrow
hips, Not good to give birth,

26:29.923 --> 26:34.419
You want one with wide hips,
Then they shoot out,

26:34.802 --> 26:37.211
You have a good physique,

26:46.147 --> 26:50.525
Now we have done it,
and it was great,

26:50.652 --> 26:55.194
When I think of people
who do-

26:55.324 --> 26:59.902
they are usually more than that,
if you know what I mean,

27:00.037 --> 27:02.990
Stop, I would not want to talk about it,

27:03.123 --> 27:06.622
I'm just saying
that we should consider it,

27:06.751 --> 27:11.663
Therefore, we should not see each other
see, I do not be fooled,

27:11.839 --> 27:16.336
And I want our friendship
do not ruin it,

27:16.470 --> 27:21.844
And you means a lot to me,
Therefore, we must consider it,

27:21.974 --> 27:28.309
Can not we just chill?
You know, just chilling out,

27:28.440 --> 27:32.769
That's a new adjective
noun for this relationship,

27:34.904 --> 27:37.478
Yes, Walk on road
difficult conversations,

27:38.240 --> 27:43.483
It is not a difficult conversation
if you have it every day,

28:07.729 --> 28:12.936
With T,J, and that stupid snake
this is the last thing I want to do now,

28:13.067 --> 28:16.354
This is the correct distraction above,
Ready?

28:16.488 --> 28:22.361
Here we go, The goal is that Lee
gives you a thousand dollars,

28:22.493 --> 28:26.443
Remember that it's not mind control
is, but influence,

28:26.582 --> 28:31.657
You should affect him
he gives you the money,

28:31.795 --> 28:35.959
When we were filming this, we get the
Professor Milan Stock Exchange,

28:36.090 --> 28:38.333
Then we go to work,

28:39.635 --> 28:44.179
Lee! What is it for there, buddy?
- Awesome,

28:44.307 --> 28:50.096
Nice of you to come here,
This we should do more often,

28:55.152 --> 28:58.402
So ,,, okay,

29:00.990 --> 29:05.984
I'm hypnotized or something?
- No,

29:06.121 --> 29:10.367
I was once hypnotized,
That was fantastic,

29:10.500 --> 29:17.381
It was hilarious, I thought I
was a dog and had a tail,

29:18.759 --> 29:23.550
Is that the end of the story?
- Yes, Dog and tail,

29:27.976 --> 29:34.263
Lee, can I borrow a thousand dollars?
- No, I do not have a thousand dollars,

29:35.483 --> 29:38.934
And your parents?
- I'm now between jobs,

29:39.070 --> 29:44.575
And women, You would give me a
tussenman call,

29:44.910 --> 29:51.576
Are you therefore come? Around me
thousand dollars to extort?

29:52.166 --> 29:55.915
We call Lee ,,,
- I get a thousand dollars or not?

29:56.255 --> 29:59.421
No, I have no money,
and my father either,

29:59.548 --> 30:03.760
He may earn 12,500 with
bottling its own water,

30:03.886 --> 30:07.719
He distributes it,
The hot tap,

30:13.605 --> 30:21.316
Lee, would you help me? We are
friends and I need your help,

30:21.989 --> 30:26.780
You're the only one I can
questions, Can you help me?

30:26.868 --> 30:33.369
I can not say which, and
pay you back as soon as possible,

30:34.710 --> 30:38.837
No, I'm sorry, but
I do not have a thousand dollars,

30:41.549 --> 30:46.175
Listen, if it's any consolation,

30:46.888 --> 30:53.721
I would have made love with you,
You said it, and I enjoyed ,,,,

30:53.854 --> 31:00.734
I saw the two of us together,
- We call Trent,

31:01.361 --> 31:08.608
I do not quite see naked,
But you should do so,

31:09.036 --> 31:15.240
Test this nonsense on a girl,
That is guaranteed,

31:15.750 --> 31:20.460
Then we go to work,
- Find that snake, okay?

31:20.588 --> 31:26.592
I do not like this rejection,
Go with someone,

31:26.720 --> 31:30.384
I should've kissed you,
On the mouth,

31:39.106 --> 31:40.898
What?
- Nothing,

31:42.109 --> 31:46.855
He sounded so convincing,
'I want to make love to you',

31:48.575 --> 31:53.451
Was he serious?
- He'd kiss you on the mouth,

31:54.288 --> 32:00.458
Does he really want me here with women
go seduce? I'm mature,

32:00.586 --> 32:04.204
This is technique,

32:04.340 --> 32:08.505
We do not use math
formula to pick up women,

32:08.636 --> 32:14.924
We use it to T,J, and Amy
love let us be,

32:15.059 --> 32:21.596
That is too crazy for words,
Crass, Too much fun,

32:21.732 --> 32:23.855
Very nice,

32:37.458 --> 32:41.454
I find it wonderful to have fun,
- Really?

32:43.755 --> 32:48.750
My evening is not perfect
if I do not get your number,

32:51.888 --> 32:56.218
If I may get ,,,

32:56.351 --> 32:58.722
Absolutely,

33:06.944 --> 33:09.567
I think I know you,
Or not,

33:18.207 --> 33:21.161
You're totally my type,
- What?

33:21.292 --> 33:25.455
I think I love you,
- What?

33:25.588 --> 33:28.506
You do not know me, creep,

33:30.093 --> 33:33.545
I am ready,
- 7, 4, 6,

33:33.680 --> 33:36.681
7, 4, 6,
- 8, 2, 9,

33:36.807 --> 33:39.346
8, 2, 9,
- 7 3,

33:39.478 --> 33:41.269
7, 3,
- 4,

33:41.395 --> 33:43.886
4,
- 6, 4,

33:44.023 --> 33:46.099
7, 9, 4, 5,

33:48.069 --> 33:52.067
Those are 14 digits ,,,
You're not here,

33:53.032 --> 34:00.031
Can I pour something?
I want to have a nice evening,

34:49.422 --> 34:54.001
<I> Only a rose, </ I>
<I> - That's why you should choose me </ i>,

34:54.135 --> 34:57.385
<I> I know all the vice presidents, </ I>

34:57.514 --> 35:01.262
<I> Ignore him, I have a tree house </ i>
<I> I've been working on for 14 years, </ I>

35:01.643 --> 35:06.056
<I> I love Bette Midler, </ I>
<I> - Me too, I do Jazzercise, </ I>

35:06.398 --> 35:11.106
Look, The angle between its head
and shoulder is 60 degrees,

35:11.235 --> 35:14.023
What does it mean?
- Increased interest,

35:14.155 --> 35:18.900
We have to think of questions,
- Hey guys,

35:19.994 --> 35:23.114
That is old, we may issue
look this week?

35:23.248 --> 35:25.916
Yes, I fast forward,
- No,

35:26.083 --> 35:31.623
I want to see if Marissa Steve and Paul
choose, For the study,

35:31.757 --> 35:36.085
Why? Steve is at the end
this episode turned away,

35:36.427 --> 35:42.548
Thanks, That's my melon,
- That I wanted to distribute,

35:44.728 --> 35:46.637
But it's a good episode,

35:55.280 --> 36:00.619
We need to simplify it,
Delete does not mean anything,

36:00.744 --> 36:04.990
Social status, Family history,
Perfume,

36:05.331 --> 36:07.454
Only the most important,

36:07.793 --> 36:12.003
Good news, guys,
- Did you find the snake?

36:12.130 --> 36:17.586
No, he's here somewhere,
But I started for myself,

36:17.719 --> 36:18.916
Cool,

36:19.054 --> 36:25.672
People on celebrities
sell similar chips on eBay?

36:25.811 --> 36:28.052
You know?
- Yes ,,,

36:28.188 --> 36:34.309
In the kitchen looking for food
that looks like celebrities,

36:34.652 --> 36:40.608
Then I can be here all day
search for Sam Beckett,

36:42.202 --> 36:47.659
That still does not succeed,
That's not a job,

36:47.791 --> 36:51.159
That's certainly a job,

36:53.088 --> 36:56.753
What is this?
What have we here?

36:57.885 --> 37:04.764
Sometimes they are hard to find,
Like these,

37:06.726 --> 37:12.231
My goodness, is that Willem Dafoe?
That's him, I think,

37:12.356 --> 37:17.103
25! 30! 75! $ 400!
7 million dollars!

37:17.237 --> 37:20.985
There's the rent,
There is a new car,

37:33.085 --> 37:34.960
We see something overlooked,

37:39.217 --> 37:42.170
Under what circumstances
she looked away?

37:43.179 --> 37:48.684
Yes, she looked at her friend,
she looked at me, Recalibrate I 95%,

37:49.061 --> 37:51.467
That's not it,

37:58.195 --> 38:02.275
No, That's not it,
That's us,

38:02.657 --> 38:07.117
What?
- The opposite risk of errors,

38:08.246 --> 38:12.492
It is not the women,
We are, We are the X-factor,

38:12.626 --> 38:16.753
We must distinguish ourselves
of the other men,

38:40.987 --> 38:46.574
You flirt already two minutes, but
do not drink offered yet,

38:46.702 --> 38:52.490
I do not even know your name,
Why would I flirt with you?

38:52.583 --> 38:57.327
Slow down, prospector,
- My name is Libby,

38:58.547 --> 39:01.797
I'm alright, Begin with
the elements of Euclid,

39:01.925 --> 39:05.673
The principle of Archimedes,
The Cartesian coordinates,

39:08.472 --> 39:10.963
What?
- What are we doing?

39:11.143 --> 39:13.349
We observe,
- Yes,

39:13.478 --> 39:19.516
Look, What is he doing now? Step 1,
- A girl find to take,

39:19.650 --> 39:21.358
No, trust is step one,

39:21.487 --> 39:25.400
Step 2?
- Step 2 is jealousy,

39:25.532 --> 39:29.364
I was just saying,
J-A-L-O-E-S-I-E,

39:29.494 --> 39:33.989
I want to be a heartbreaker,
I play along during the interview,

39:34.123 --> 39:36.365
Oh okay,

39:36.585 --> 39:40.083
That's Foot Doctor,
Loves 80s music,

39:40.672 --> 39:45.963
That's High Heels, Nice girl,
but no sense of humor,

39:46.887 --> 39:51.181
That's Reader, Likes classical
novels, Only drink wine,

39:51.307 --> 39:58.188
I owe them something,
You're number four on my list,

39:58.565 --> 40:03.311
Why does Libby
I offered her a drink?

40:03.445 --> 40:07.858
P measured along the horizontal
perpendicular line from P to Y-axis,

40:07.990 --> 40:12.867
Do not look to the breasts,
Mass to maintain balance,

40:12.996 --> 40:18.072
Stirs in her glass, I'm sitting
the compression ratio?

40:18.210 --> 40:22.835
Hi, I see you staring at me,
Heavens, what a big breasts,

40:22.965 --> 40:25.170
Poor back,

40:25.342 --> 40:29.719
The concept of forbidden fruit,
You want what you can not have,

40:29.846 --> 40:33.891
What is she?
You must be jealous say

40:34.016 --> 40:36.175
She must be happy now,

40:36.811 --> 40:42.766
I do not know if you're serious,
- That's my secret,

40:42.900 --> 40:44.775
Look,
- What?

40:44.902 --> 40:48.983
I drew one pilgrim on one napkin,
Look what he has on his head,

40:49.115 --> 40:55.699
He talks to her,
- It is a pilgrim penis hat,

40:56.164 --> 41:02.416
Consider yourself a superstar?
- No, Does a superstar this?

41:04.880 --> 41:07.170
Yes,
- Yes, It works,

41:10.469 --> 41:17.351
You did damn,
- Shit, It works,

41:18.144 --> 41:21.429
What works?
- We did it,

41:25.360 --> 41:28.894
We have to go,
We need to document this,

41:29.030 --> 41:31.023
Where are you going?

41:31.365 --> 41:36.324
This is a pilgrim penis hat,

41:36.788 --> 41:41.201
It has a buckle and a hat ,,,
- Shut up,

41:56.224 --> 41:59.427
We tell someone?
- Not yet,

41:59.561 --> 42:02.728
No, Not yet,

42:02.856 --> 42:05.891
I'm T,J, call,
- What? No!

42:06.318 --> 42:09.686
We would not tell you, That is
the worst thing you can do,

42:09.820 --> 42:13.273
Why?
- We do not know if it works,

42:13.407 --> 42:18.449
We tested it and it works,
- We tested it once,

42:18.579 --> 42:24.166
Putting the Wright brothers immediately
300 people in a jumbo jet?

42:25.170 --> 42:29.831
I suggest that we first here
a bit of fun to go along stairs,

42:29.967 --> 42:34.711
It is not to decorate,
- You're wrong,

42:34.846 --> 42:39.554
If your chances with T,J, want
screw up, go ahead,

42:39.684 --> 42:43.634
Flush it if you want,
but do not take me,

42:43.771 --> 42:49.311
What do you suggest?
- We will first slow,

42:49.443 --> 42:55.898
Seeing in perspective,
We are young and single,

42:56.034 --> 43:03.032
We just mathematician
minimized uncertainty,

43:03.166 --> 43:07.378
We must first
solve a few things,

43:07.503 --> 43:14.302
Then we can the ladies love
let it be us, Well?

43:15.679 --> 43:22.427
Okay, But once it works, I call T,J,

43:28.608 --> 43:35.144
Because this is ,,, science,
- This is technique,

43:41.038 --> 43:45.414
I want to return this shirt,
- Of course, no problem,

43:52.465 --> 43:54.873
It's too tight,

43:58.847 --> 44:00.472
Okay ,,,

44:02.768 --> 44:05.887
Okay, very beautiful,

44:06.021 --> 44:11.561
You've won the lottery,
You can now pay for that trip,

44:11.693 --> 44:15.561
Amazing, You are a
attractive bunch,

44:15.905 --> 44:20.733
Honestly, you're the
attractive couple ever,

44:22.161 --> 44:29.992
What size you usually wear?
- Extra ,,, extra ,,, extra ,,, large,

44:33.965 --> 44:37.050
Thanks again,
We are very curious,

44:37.177 --> 44:42.847
The pleasure is all mine,
How long have you been dating?

44:42.932 --> 44:45.304
A Tuesday year,

44:45.434 --> 44:50.596
That you stand it so long with him,
I was sitting by him long ago,

44:51.483 --> 44:58.860
And it is only 60% cotton,
I want 100%,

44:58.989 --> 45:00.650
Cotton,

45:01.117 --> 45:05.530
Do you want your money back,
or do you want to exchange for one-

45:05.664 --> 45:09.791
XXXL shirt cotton?

45:12.713 --> 45:17.291
Can I return the money
and decide later?

45:17.425 --> 45:21.257
No problem,
- Put it on my card,

45:30.396 --> 45:36.518
You are incredibly attractive,
Our band is now stronger,

45:36.652 --> 45:42.027
I agree with that, Steve?
- You two should have lunch,

45:42.159 --> 45:45.324
Thank you,
- I'm sorry, friend,

45:47.539 --> 45:50.742
Wait, What is going on?

45:51.751 --> 45:55.831
Caught in time jumps
Dr, Beckett of life to life-

45:55.922 --> 46:02.423
and corrects mistakes, hoping
he jumps back home,

46:46.222 --> 46:49.224
Daniel Craig,

46:56.358 --> 46:59.110
Nothing in this,

47:01.989 --> 47:04.195
Cheers,

47:06.242 --> 47:10.193
This tastes so good that costs flat
more than the entree,

47:10.329 --> 47:14.708
I can only drink water,
- He's an alcoholic,

47:14.835 --> 47:20.753
Not something for a first date,
But I struggle with it now,

47:21.300 --> 47:27.753
It's okay if you get to know me,
- It affects his life,

47:28.431 --> 47:33.769
Here it goes well,
but later he gets a relapse,

47:34.938 --> 47:37.643
I grab your napkin,

47:39.525 --> 47:44.271
Shelly did you kiss?
- I thought she was mine,

47:44.405 --> 47:48.617
She is yours, And she is 70,
- I know,

47:48.744 --> 47:51.744
Cozy, It was cozy,

47:51.871 --> 47:56.083
I go bungee jumping with Crystal,
- Crystal is great,

47:56.208 --> 48:01.583
They parachuted last week,
Unbelievable,

48:01.715 --> 48:07.135
I have this on potato
Anne Hathaway seems sold,

48:07.804 --> 48:12.431
Hello, who's there?
Is that opportunity that calling? Yes!

48:17.355 --> 48:23.358
He eats all of Snickers, And say
then:"I'm late for work,"

48:24.195 --> 48:29.190
Hungry? Why wait until you
fired? Very sad,

48:30.202 --> 48:34.864
He gives the homeless a dollar,
Appears to be the Gerald Ford,

48:35.289 --> 48:38.327
Since in the gutter, Crazy,

48:49.596 --> 48:53.925
Del, Slut, Slut,

49:01.817 --> 49:06.942
What is your educational philosophy
to form young minds?

49:14.246 --> 49:18.112
The mind of a child is beautiful,

49:18.583 --> 49:23.625
Not yet filled with hatred and disgust
where the world is full of them,

49:23.755 --> 49:29.876
But with love and creativity
which we do not have anymore,

49:30.012 --> 49:36.050
We forget our own youth
this guy spirits surrounds,

49:36.184 --> 49:38.889
Who am I
in order to stand in the way?

49:39.021 --> 49:45.307
The question is, is was the
educational philosophy of youth?

49:46.612 --> 49:49.980
Let's
as a starting point,

49:51.574 --> 49:55.239
Interesting,
- Bosh,

50:03.836 --> 50:07.501
What this has with
Charles Dickens to do?

50:07.757 --> 50:10.545
Absolutely everything,

50:23.356 --> 50:27.485
That looks good,
You have a nice shirt,

50:27.610 --> 50:32.188
I love this shirt,
You will like this shirt?

50:43.168 --> 50:46.418
Hello, How is it pink?

50:46.545 --> 50:49.961
Quinn, you want chimichanga?

50:50.300 --> 50:53.420

50:53.552 --> 50:58.132

- Wow,

50:58.266 --> 51:02.726
Watch what you say, I have one here
woman of Mexican descent,

51:02.853 --> 51:09.853
Then order them,
- Sorry, some insensitive,

51:11.445 --> 51:13.521
I could eat her taco,

52:29.190 --> 52:33.141
Harrison, you sly dog,

52:33.277 --> 52:37.856
You are not on the list,
- Do not do that,

52:37.990 --> 52:43.530
I'm kidding,
- Go away, This guy,

52:43.664 --> 52:48.871
Quinn, you look giant sexy,
- I feel sexy tonight,

52:49.001 --> 52:50.829
Give me two, Boom,

52:50.963 --> 52:55.173
What have we here?
A romance in the stairwell?

52:55.300 --> 53:01.552
Is that Chris Denclaw?
- Get lost,

53:01.681 --> 53:06.923
Are you ready?
- Everyone from the clothes,

53:17.530 --> 53:20.282
Everyone from the clothes,

53:20.409 --> 53:25.449
Robbie, how are you?
- Graham, glad you're here,

53:25.581 --> 53:31.286
Got my shirt now?
- He wears other people's shirts,

53:31.420 --> 53:36.295
Have fun, boys, There is plenty
food and enough women,

53:36.425 --> 53:39.675
Daryl, All right, buddy?

53:43.389 --> 53:47.518
Does anyone want a hot dog?
- I want a hot dog,

54:00.032 --> 54:05.405
That was a good joke,
- Have you ever played poker with them?

54:05.536 --> 54:10.413
What are we talking about?
- Yes, Amy, Jessica, Megan,

54:11.835 --> 54:14.918
Come, take a picture,

54:40.572 --> 54:43.572
The Constantinian dynasty,
- Everytime,

54:46.452 --> 54:51.614
You, me, this bottle, trio,
what do you say?

54:53.168 --> 54:56.204
Where are we going?
I do not even ,,,

55:13.938 --> 55:18.896
I had not told you yet
I have a date with Amy,

55:19.027 --> 55:22.811
Good for you,
- We're laser gaming,

55:22.947 --> 55:26.447
Then to my house
Quantum Leap and wine,

55:26.577 --> 55:30.905
Cute,

55:32.498 --> 55:35.666

No idea, Go with her lunch,
Sushi, And they must pay,

55:41.967 --> 55:47.126
You do not pay her,
- I'm doing her a favor,

55:47.264 --> 55:52.009
I worry that she's in love with me,
Love you, honey,

56:01.027 --> 56:06.269
Sorry, can you one of them?
- This one?

56:07.117 --> 56:11.244
You're not going to drink alone?
Want some company?

56:11.371 --> 56:14.786
My husband is a little sick,

56:14.916 --> 56:20.871

Sorry,

56:21.005 --> 56:24.873

56:39.483 --> 56:44.108
You've cut your hair,
- This is the new me,

56:44.237 --> 56:48.567
I miss the old,
- Really? Well, I do not,

56:48.659 --> 56:52.407

How are you?

56:52.538 --> 56:57.958
I'm fine,

57:38.916 --> 57:44.670
No idea,
That was weird,

57:46.132 --> 57:53.048
We can home to me
to watch a movie,

57:54.724 --> 57:59.682
I'm busy tonight,

57:59.813 --> 58:05.353
I run two services tonight, and
must write, You know that,

58:05.485 --> 58:07.525
Do you remember?
- Yes,

58:07.987 --> 58:10.822
An essay for English,
- No history,

58:10.990 --> 58:14.489
No, I told you English,

58:14.619 --> 58:19.958
Mr, Popular,
- No, I've been very busy,

58:20.083 --> 58:23.701
What I'm trying to say is ,,,

58:24.545 --> 58:30.251
Dumb phone, Who is calling me now?
Marissa? Shit, it was forgotten,

58:30.802 --> 58:36.177
I have T,J, call, Wait, T,J, is

58:41.730 --> 58:44.646
What I wanted to say is ,,,

58:44.775 --> 58:47.610
Asshole,

58:48.027 --> 58:51.527
Got a problem?

Sorry, everyone,
- Quinn, I have to go,

58:55.744 --> 58:58.780
Wait, T,J,
I'll walk you to the car,

58:58.956 --> 59:05.324
My car is parked nearby,
- No, you do not ,,,

59:05.461 --> 59:10.456
Do not work too hard,
Your breasts look great,

59:11.300 --> 59:16.092
Well done, asshole,
- Shut up,

59:18.599 --> 59:21.387
Scott Bakula is so handsome,

59:21.519 --> 59:25.599
He is a national treasure,
You smell nice tonight,

59:25.731 --> 59:29.065

59:29.193 --> 59:31.436
I'm tired, just want ,,,

59:31.572 --> 59:34.608
We go to your room
and see who calls the first,

59:34.740 --> 59:38.690
You have to go now,
- I love your breasts wonderful,

59:39.788 --> 59:44.615
I'll see you later,
Scott, what should we do?

59:54.135 --> 59:59.177
I must have missed something,
Something is missing,

01:00:00.684 --> 01:00:03.554
What happened to you on?
- The formula contains an error,

01:00:03.686 --> 01:00:05.014
What happened?

01:00:05.146 --> 01:00:08.811
Amy and I watched Quantum Leap,
I do not know how to say it,

01:00:08.942 --> 01:00:12.525
Everything, but everything went wrong,

01:00:12.653 --> 01:00:16.652
The same happened to me,
I took T,J, out to dinner,

01:00:16.782 --> 01:00:20.117
I cried for an old guy
and her breasts,

01:00:20.286 --> 01:00:25.197
You yelled at her breasts?
- We need to fix this,

01:00:25.333 --> 01:00:29.829
Before we go to the professor,
- I forgot about that with Milan,

01:00:29.963 --> 01:00:34.175
I'm working on a proposal,
- I have to cancel that appointment,

01:00:35.342 --> 01:00:36.672
Marissa,

01:00:44.686 --> 01:00:47.722
Gentlemen, let me be brief,

01:00:47.856 --> 01:00:53.016
In ten minutes, I'm going with my
woman at a True Blood party,

01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:58.362
Professor Milan, how are you?
- Good thank you,

01:01:01.829 --> 01:01:06.324
Do you believe in the theory of
Love at first sight?

01:01:06.458 --> 01:01:08.117
What did you think?

01:01:08.251 --> 01:01:15.297
My wife fell in love
when she saw my corpulent body,

01:01:15.884 --> 01:01:18.802
Okay, perfect,
- Perfect,

01:01:18.929 --> 01:01:22.677
Well, that's no longer theory,

01:01:23.224 --> 01:01:29.512
We have a formula
which proves that,

01:01:30.690 --> 01:01:35.731
Factors affecting millions
one human interaction,

01:01:36.570 --> 01:01:42.775
Her words and clothing,
What they want to hear, What we say,

01:01:42.911 --> 01:01:48.451
Two different things,
- Where she is, how she bends,

01:01:48.583 --> 01:01:52.829
Every important detail
in this formula,

01:01:53.213 --> 01:02:00.460
Use it when you talk,
every woman falls in love with you,

01:02:06.268 --> 01:02:08.840
And that's what we have,

01:02:08.978 --> 01:02:15.480
I am president of a leading
standing technical College

01:02:16.068 --> 01:02:23.068
and you can mind control over
exercise someone?

01:02:24.869 --> 01:02:28.036
Okay, Look at this,

01:02:28.373 --> 01:02:32.702
Say, I walk to the library
here on campus,

01:02:32.835 --> 01:02:38.340
And who is that? A baby,
All alone, How sad,

01:02:38.467 --> 01:02:45.844
I go to her and make sure
I'm her dream choice,

01:02:46.849 --> 01:02:53.387
And she wants nothing but a
have relationship with me,

01:02:53.773 --> 01:02:57.936
The only way,
I feel safe and secure,

01:02:58.070 --> 01:03:00.275
I am a supplier,

01:03:00.405 --> 01:03:04.320
And that's all,
Do not tell me you felt nothing,

01:03:05.661 --> 01:03:11.746
I considered jumping out the window
when I heard the drivel,

01:03:11.875 --> 01:03:17.664
I think he does not understand us,
- We say smart things,

01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:22.632
I take it back,
- Rewind,

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:29.807
I think you can not understand
how successful we are,

01:03:29.934 --> 01:03:36.139
Dozens? Hundreds of women
This method recent weeks,

01:03:36.315 --> 01:03:39.684
Are you tired? I'm tired, I take
my vitamin tablets, but ,,,

01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:44.731
We have sex very often,
- I understand you not,

01:03:45.117 --> 01:03:51.403
You come here and talk about
decorating girls,

01:03:52.248 --> 01:03:58.750
You are chauvinistic,
onverantwoordelijke-

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:05.463
despicable, deplorable,
selfish, zielige-

01:04:05.762 --> 01:04:09.380
talent wasteful,
potentieverspillende-

01:04:09.516 --> 01:04:14.344
huge idiots, The largest ever
studied here,

01:04:16.356 --> 01:04:19.143
Thank you,
- You're welcome,

01:04:19.275 --> 01:04:23.438
Rebecca, do me a favor and make
sure it idioten-

01:04:23.572 --> 01:04:28.648
prohibited from ever being my
office visit,

01:04:28.784 --> 01:04:32.617
Thank you,
- Why are you such an asshole?

01:04:32.748 --> 01:04:36.496
What did you call me?

01:04:36.626 --> 01:04:40.077
John, is everything okay?
- Watch and weep,

01:04:40.422 --> 01:04:44.467
Hi, come on in, No, come on in,

01:04:44.592 --> 01:04:47.961
We close the door,
so you can not escape,

01:04:48.096 --> 01:04:54.384
Graham made a compliment,
without exaggeration,

01:04:54.519 --> 01:04:59.809
The reliability index of 95%
and the volume that will be expressed ,,,

01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:06.144
,,, By variable X,
- Where are you going tonight?

01:05:06.489 --> 01:05:09.655
I am married,
- What? I do not care,

01:05:09.784 --> 01:05:13.829
I'm coming, sweetheart, But I have a few
idiots to get rid of,

01:05:13.954 --> 01:05:18.250
Let me on a more intimate
illustrate manner,

01:05:20.211 --> 01:05:26.713
But that's my wife,
- We turn the wedding ring,

01:05:30.179 --> 01:05:34.260
You two weeks against
the decision before go-

01:05:34.393 --> 01:05:40.016
and may your side of the case to
bring forward before,

01:05:40.565 --> 01:05:43.851
Shit,
- It could have been better,

01:05:44.652 --> 01:05:49.563
I'm too drunk
to think about this,

01:05:49.699 --> 01:05:55.286
I'm exhausted, I'm going home,
- I stay a while,

01:05:55.414 --> 01:06:01.416
I'm going to destroy the barmaid,
- Success, We see each other at home,

01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:07.461
I come here to have fun,

01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:29.771
I heard you had a fine
last night,

01:06:31.782 --> 01:06:36.528
Unbelievable that you barmaid
decorated, Cool,

01:06:51.969 --> 01:06:55.838
Why Amy just left the apartment?

01:06:57.684 --> 01:07:02.726
When was the last time you
talked? Two weeks ago?

01:07:02.856 --> 01:07:06.900
Really,
- We went out, had fun

01:07:06.985 --> 01:07:13.237
No problem,
- No problem, A little one,

01:07:13.365 --> 01:07:19.820
Are you listening to yourself?
You know what you've done?

01:07:20.748 --> 01:07:24.960
You're going out with Amy, My 65%
perfect companion Amy,

01:07:25.086 --> 01:07:29.463
Amy is the love of my life,
- So what?

01:07:29.590 --> 01:07:33.422
Sure, So what,
- Reason,

01:07:33.804 --> 01:07:39.806
Do you really want to do this?
- Yes, I love my T-shirt,

01:07:39.934 --> 01:07:44.811
You want to see me without T-shirt,
- That would be like,

01:07:46.315 --> 01:07:51.606
Goodness, Coward,
I would not do it,

01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:57.235
You little girl, No wonder
Amy you do not like,

01:07:57.369 --> 01:08:01.615
Would you not air in your lungs
have to live?

01:08:01.748 --> 01:08:06.706
Wait a minute,
You're like a baby,

01:08:06.836 --> 01:08:13.255
You use a cooking machine,
- You're a girl with a vagina,

01:08:13.385 --> 01:08:16.635
A small vagina? You have still
always a hit phone, Why?

01:08:16.805 --> 01:08:23.221
Those are cool, Indian in the Cupboard
is your favorite movie,

01:08:23.354 --> 01:08:27.850
You look Felicity and eat frootloops,
I've seen you cry,

01:08:27.983 --> 01:08:32.645
I think Felicity well, You too,
- No! Only season two,

01:08:32.779 --> 01:08:38.948
Want a little reality?
Here then,

01:08:39.078 --> 01:08:44.617
My name is Quinn, I like T, J,,
but I'm too chicken to say anything,

01:08:51.256 --> 01:08:56.462
Did you learn from your boyfriend?
- You learned that the flickering camp?

01:08:56.595 --> 01:09:02.764
You carry on purpose Felicity T-shirts,
- You've got a Sega Game Gear,

01:09:02.893 --> 01:09:08.563
She was the love of my life,
- Love? She had nothing against me,

01:09:11.024 --> 01:09:13.564
Slang!

01:09:41.139 --> 01:09:47.094
Karma comes in the form of arrow and
arc, Never talk to me anymore,

01:09:50.064 --> 01:09:54.644
Sam Beckett,
You fickle mistress,

01:09:57.447 --> 01:10:00.947
My pants sits between my cheeks,

01:10:22.471 --> 01:10:26.304
T,J, Wait,
- Hi, what are you doing here?

01:10:26.435 --> 01:10:30.681
I have to tell you something,
- What happened to your foot?

01:10:30.814 --> 01:10:36.104
Part of my klotedag,
- Sorry,

01:10:36.778 --> 01:10:44.155
I want to talk, I was not myself
as you might have noticed,

01:10:44.286 --> 01:10:50.738
I treat people badly, Stable
since a long time in a candy shop,

01:10:52.002 --> 01:10:58.122
Why are you telling me that?
- They disappeared when I saw you,

01:11:00.010 --> 01:11:04.886
Every time I talk to you,
if only one SEC

01:11:05.015 --> 01:11:09.012
that is the best of the day,

01:11:12.648 --> 01:11:19.230
Do you know that John Adams and
John Quincy Adams family?

01:11:20.488 --> 01:11:26.360
Who is this?
- Quinn ,,, This is my ,,,

01:11:27.203 --> 01:11:31.948
Really? He?
- Annoying, Do you want a hug?

01:11:32.082 --> 01:11:33.363
No!

01:11:43.302 --> 01:11:48.047
So much corduroy,
- Yes, We have to go now,

01:11:48.182 --> 01:11:52.644
We'll talk later, okay?
- Take it easy,

01:11:53.814 --> 01:11:56.305
Bye, T,J,

01:12:00.028 --> 01:12:06.149
Jakkie, I collected coins
and I've seen everything,

01:12:08.787 --> 01:12:12.832
I can only ,,, Jakkie,

01:12:12.957 --> 01:12:18.199
Quinn! You used the
like a champion,

01:12:24.970 --> 01:12:29.298
Let me see you smile,
That was a good one,

01:12:29.432 --> 01:12:34.309
Nice picture, Stay in this position,
That's a nice one,

01:12:34.438 --> 01:12:38.766
That feels good,
1, 2, Have already taken him, Sorry

01:12:38.899 --> 01:12:43.811
This is for the family album,
Ready, What do you think?

01:12:43.947 --> 01:12:47.779
We did not even look,
- What?

01:12:48.702 --> 01:12:53.695
Is this the best place
for an anniversary album?

01:12:53.832 --> 01:12:58.292
What does it matter whether it's here or somewhere
otherwise, It's just a picture,

01:12:58.377 --> 01:13:02.328
Watch your words,
- Joe, do not excite yourself,

01:13:02.506 --> 01:13:07.335
I know what the problem is,
- He needs a lesson in manners,

01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:12.048
I have two fists,
one for each side of your face,

01:13:12.184 --> 01:13:15.386
Do not get excited, Joe, Quiet,

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:18.520
What is her name?
- What?

01:13:19.481 --> 01:13:23.694
The girl's name
that makes you behave so,

01:13:25.988 --> 01:13:30.698
I know what you're trying,
I have not experienced bunch necessary-

01:13:30.828 --> 01:13:35.157
coming here and trying my
sense of self-worth to verhogen-

01:13:35.289 --> 01:13:40.036
and my relationship with young love
trying to recover,

01:13:52.306 --> 01:13:55.390
Mr Lawrence, Mr Lawrence!

01:14:00.899 --> 01:14:04.350
Give me that phone,

01:14:06.404 --> 01:14:10.734
Jake find me believe I like it,
What should I do?

01:14:10.868 --> 01:14:16.739
Is not that tricky, Emily? You know what
you need to do to me?

01:14:16.872 --> 01:14:21.783
Assign him now he had some
has dignity,

01:14:22.378 --> 01:14:26.921
Will you do that, Emily?
Would you do that for me?

01:14:27.050 --> 01:14:31.759
Give a little dignity?
Let him alone, Emily?

01:14:31.889 --> 01:14:34.805
Would you do that please?

01:14:35.475 --> 01:14:41.679
The lesson today is:Things in
real life that does not exist,

01:14:42.815 --> 01:14:46.019
Number one:True love,

01:14:46.153 --> 01:14:50.447
Should we write it?
- 'Should we write it? "

01:14:50.573 --> 01:14:54.524
Yes, you should write down,
Put your books close,

01:14:54.661 --> 01:14:58.956
There will be an exam,
The examination of life,

01:14:59.375 --> 01:15:02.541
You will all fail,

01:15:05.130 --> 01:15:08.332
You are all corrupt,

01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:16.301
And that's what the real hell,

01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:26.479
Thank you, Really,
It was a pleasure,

01:15:31.198 --> 01:15:36.618
That's the last time I
Craftsman tools use,

01:15:37.119 --> 01:15:44.202
That's life, Drink some, Stick your
finger on to the women,

01:15:44.586 --> 01:15:49.960
I am glad that we no woman
have, We do what we want,

01:15:51.801 --> 01:15:55.751
Look at that guy,
So pathetic there,

01:15:55.889 --> 01:16:00.016
I would be his eulogy at his
good days must ven-

01:16:00.143 --> 01:16:03.926
for they are gone,
That are dead,

01:16:08.694 --> 01:16:13.271
This is so great,
- I want nothing more than this life,

01:16:13.364 --> 01:16:17.314
Can you keep your mouth shut,
Please,

01:16:18.162 --> 01:16:23.287
Got a problem?
- Do you know how pathetic you sound?

01:16:23.833 --> 01:16:26.621
Yes, What?

01:16:27.421 --> 01:16:31.086
You believe you are single
because you want to,

01:16:31.216 --> 01:16:34.833
Yes,
- The reality is different,

01:16:35.345 --> 01:16:38.761
You're single
because you have no choice,

01:16:39.181 --> 01:16:46.644
No woman wants to go out with you,
as long as you behave so pathetic,

01:16:47.356 --> 01:16:49.184
Wastrel,

01:16:50.068 --> 01:16:51.645
For life,

01:16:52.319 --> 01:16:57.528
I'm sick,

01:17:07.085 --> 01:17:12.162
Sorry, Why am I
everybody cry?

01:17:21.390 --> 01:17:26.634
Drive you?
- What you did was not necessary,

01:17:27.188 --> 01:17:29.514
Sure, But walk away,

01:17:50.045 --> 01:17:55.204
This toast is like
the Christmas album of Kenny G,

01:17:55.341 --> 01:17:58.260
$ 1,200,

01:17:58.636 --> 01:18:02.255
I am happy for you,
- What happened to you on?

01:18:03.641 --> 01:18:09.561
I might have 20 young lives
ruined, my friends hate me-

01:18:09.689 --> 01:18:13.189
the love of my life
disappeared, should I go on?

01:18:13.275 --> 01:18:16.360
You have to see the positive,
- That's not so simple,

01:18:16.488 --> 01:18:23.202
I told her I love her
am, and she rejected me,

01:18:23.328 --> 01:18:26.945
You know what? Life goes on,
One girl pointed you,

01:18:27.082 --> 01:18:33.286
There are bigger problems in the
world, I'm not comforted,

01:18:35.631 --> 01:18:40.293
Do not whine and do not worry
about what you can not influence,

01:18:40.386 --> 01:18:46.176
Worry about your example
damaged friendships,

01:18:46.601 --> 01:18:51.429
It bothers me that a good guy
like you-

01:18:51.564 --> 01:18:57.234
so much time and talent wasted on
such childish things,

01:18:59.488 --> 01:19:01.695
Grow up, Quinn,

01:19:10.875 --> 01:19:14.956
Thanks, dude,
- You're welcome,

01:19:22.136 --> 01:19:25.055
Do not pretend you do not want this,

01:19:31.729 --> 01:19:36.273
How are you?
- I did not know you were coming,

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:41.145
Yes,
- Graham, I just wanted to say ,,,

01:19:41.489 --> 01:19:46.282
Good Evening, This is exciting,
I can not wait for her,

01:19:47.078 --> 01:19:54.125
I've been waiting all week on a
great excuse yours,

01:19:54.252 --> 01:20:00.125
We sincerely apologize for ,,,
- I'm sorry, Graham, I mean it,

01:20:00.509 --> 01:20:06.012
What are you doing?
- It was foolish to mess with Amy,

01:20:06.139 --> 01:20:11.595
You're my best friend, I want our
friendship not put at stake,

01:20:12.729 --> 01:20:20.190
Forget that girl, You are a good
guy and deserves better,

01:20:22.363 --> 01:20:25.863
Can this not equally bromance
wait?

01:20:25.992 --> 01:20:28.613
What about me?
- Give us a few seconds,

01:20:28.787 --> 01:20:33.413
Quinn, what are you doing?
- Let's talk like men,

01:20:35.752 --> 01:20:39.880
Professor Millan, you will find
that what we do is meaningless,

01:20:40.006 --> 01:20:44.418
And that's it,
We've been assholes,

01:20:45.386 --> 01:20:50.381
Something I've learned is that no
single book can teach me to ,,,

01:20:50.893 --> 01:20:56.313
,,, Let me act like women
a complete idiot,

01:20:58.274 --> 01:21:02.225
Damn, I know,

01:21:08.159 --> 01:21:10.152
Becky Forrester,

01:21:11.747 --> 01:21:13.158
What?

01:21:14.166 --> 01:21:19.918
I thought Becky Forrester
was correct, I did that,

01:21:20.046 --> 01:21:25.881
But she made it out the day before
my twenty-first birthday,

01:21:26.345 --> 01:21:31.220
The next evening
I wanted to be aggressive,

01:21:31.682 --> 01:21:36.310
But instead
I met this girl,

01:21:36.438 --> 01:21:40.934
And ten months later, she was
Ms, Millan,

01:21:42.944 --> 01:21:47.322
Strange things
dissolve that way,

01:21:47.448 --> 01:21:52.359
Guys, I understand you,
Really,

01:21:53.913 --> 01:21:58.789
But I have already told you:
Women ,,,

01:22:00.671 --> 01:22:06.756
are an example of things
men can never understand,

01:22:06.885 --> 01:22:08.545
Never,

01:22:08.677 --> 01:22:12.378
But nevertheless ,,,
We love it,

01:22:13.559 --> 01:22:17.639
Quinn, I should call Amy?
- Who is Amy?

01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:25.069
At this time we chill,
as they want to express,

01:22:26.445 --> 01:22:30.525
We fought,
- Lusten you raisins?

01:22:30.658 --> 01:22:37.408
I love raisins,
- Unfortunately I only have a whole bag,

01:22:41.127 --> 01:22:42.871
There you go, Amy,

01:22:43.546 --> 01:22:48.042
I need to buy new ones,
- I also have new shoes,

01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:52.092
I also have new shoes,
- I live alone,

01:22:54.349 --> 01:22:58.761
I put some pillows on the couch,
The whole room is lighter,

01:22:59.104 --> 01:23:02.270
Sounds good,
- Keep things together,

01:23:02.399 --> 01:23:05.483
Has to do with Feng Shui,
One ,,,

01:23:05.609 --> 01:23:09.229
,,, Two ,,, three,

01:23:11.699 --> 01:23:17.287
I had not met him yet,
I did not know who he was,

01:23:19.875 --> 01:23:24.832
You know ,,, One Direction
does not have a ceiling,

01:23:25.005 --> 01:23:29.547
Therefore, they are what they are,
- I did exactly as told,

01:23:29.676 --> 01:23:33.590
She was so angry,
she had no words,

01:23:33.721 --> 01:23:37.636
The Back Street Boys
can they sit on back seat,

01:23:41.854 --> 01:23:45.899
That looks like
a racetrack in Tijuana,

01:23:48.904 --> 01:23:51.311
Hi, Quinn,
- How are you?

01:23:52.032 --> 01:23:55.400
You know Libby, I believe,

01:23:56.328 --> 01:24:01.783
I want to thank you officially it
you showed us how sorry we were,

01:24:01.916 --> 01:24:04.489
Until recently,

01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:16.386
Oh baby, you're so sweet,

01:24:16.515 --> 01:24:21.092
You changed our view
in the entire universe,

01:24:22.895 --> 01:24:28.186
I am happy that
you that was recognized,

01:24:28.318 --> 01:24:31.153
And so fast,
- You're a gem,

01:24:31.279 --> 01:24:35.739
And man among boys,
- Have a nice evening,

01:24:35.908 --> 01:24:40.037
Shoot some more arrows, Cupid,

01:24:41.914 --> 01:24:44.667
You are annoying,
I'm out of here,

01:25:00.475 --> 01:25:02.966
We need to talk, Okay?

01:25:03.311 --> 01:25:06.515
Ladies and germs,

01:25:06.899 --> 01:25:10.064
We have a newcomer,

01:25:10.193 --> 01:25:15.484
Help me this man
karaoke virginity to lose,

01:25:15.573 --> 01:25:19.702
Graham Jacobs, Come here,

01:25:19.953 --> 01:25:23.322
I think there is nothing
to talk about,

01:25:23.457 --> 01:25:24.702
What ,,,

01:25:30.963 --> 01:25:33.632
Hello, My name is Graham,

01:25:33.759 --> 01:25:38.255
I'm going to sing something
I usually sing alone,

01:25:38.387 --> 01:25:42.171
But now I'm going to
sing for everyone,

01:25:57.157 --> 01:26:01.903
Just like the time
Derek and I did it,

01:26:12.881 --> 01:26:17.045
It makes me so horny,

01:26:44.787 --> 01:26:48.157
This song was always
for someone in particular,

01:26:48.332 --> 01:26:53.207
But I'm open to suggestions,
Can be for you, you're cute,

01:26:54.005 --> 01:27:01.051
I learned a lot about myself,
And I just have to sit there,

01:27:34.628 --> 01:27:40.881
Now, a random white man,
who thinks he's funny is-

01:27:41.011 --> 01:27:44.594
Tupac sing,

01:27:50.311 --> 01:27:53.561
T,J, Hi, It's Quinn,

01:27:54.231 --> 01:27:58.729
Come about 20 minutes to the New
Strand Theater, Hope to see you,

01:28:13.292 --> 01:28:14.667
Quinn?

01:28:17.546 --> 01:28:23.003
It's weird when you call me and me
asks to go to a cinema,

01:28:23.136 --> 01:28:27.548
Hello Madam, and welcome
New Strand Theatre,

01:28:28.766 --> 01:28:30.046
What is this?

01:28:30.185 --> 01:28:34.229
Tonight we turn
the latest film by Jason Statham,

01:28:34.355 --> 01:28:38.899
I forgot his name,
but he plays Keith Ramsberg,

01:28:39.027 --> 01:28:43.439
There is a knife fight scene,
and he shows his dewooling buttocks,

01:28:44.115 --> 01:28:48.195
Quinn, this is great,
but I've already told you ,,,

01:28:48.328 --> 01:28:52.372
Sorry to interrupt,

01:28:53.958 --> 01:29:00.875
When we practiced, you always said
ball long to get rolling, never short,

01:29:01.007 --> 01:29:04.043
Do you remember that?
- Yes,

01:29:05.136 --> 01:29:09.845
We can be friends,
and that's great,

01:29:09.975 --> 01:29:15.217
But I want you to know
I'm going to try it,

01:29:16.023 --> 01:29:21.064
If I do not take the opportunity to
wells, then why do I play?

01:29:23.697 --> 01:29:27.065
I'm not asking you to marry me,

01:29:27.199 --> 01:29:29.774
Not even to go together,

01:29:30.244 --> 01:29:36.579
But I ask you,
you want to see Jason Statham?

01:29:39.628 --> 01:29:43.958
You said it at the end
his bare buttocks show?

01:29:44.091 --> 01:29:50.510
Yes, He does,
- In this case, it is worth,

01:29:52.725 --> 01:29:54.682
Amazing,

01:29:58.105 --> 01:30:01.974
Would you like popcorn?
- Please,

01:30:03.110 --> 01:30:08.402
This is a terrible movie,
- The worst,

01:30:18.542 --> 01:30:20.582
