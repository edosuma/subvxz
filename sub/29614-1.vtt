WEBVTT

02:12.001 --> 02:13.481
There's an area for, too babe.

02:15.831 --> 02:18.138
We have to remodel it
a little bit, you know?

02:19.182 --> 02:20.182
But it's there.

02:22.272 --> 02:24.318
And what are we supposed
to tell my parents, Marcus?

02:24.361 --> 02:26.189
Tell 'em the truth.

02:26.233 --> 02:27.451
Marijuana's legal now, babe.

02:27.495 --> 02:29.323
So we're not doin'
anything wrong,

02:29.366 --> 02:30.889
it's a business opportunity.

02:33.065 --> 02:34.217
Just please give
it a chance, baby.

02:34.241 --> 02:35.198
Please give it a chance, baby.

02:35.242 --> 02:36.243
I promise you.

02:36.286 --> 02:39.333
I promise gon' love it.

02:39.376 --> 02:41.509
Sure, whatever.

03:29.296 --> 03:34.257
Oh my god, this place looks
like a hotel or something.

03:35.258 --> 03:37.391
Yeah, just wait 'til
you see the inside.

03:37.434 --> 03:39.175
I did not expect this at all.

03:40.481 --> 03:43.397
Okay, so the furniture inside,

03:43.440 --> 03:45.268
it's pretty old, but don't pay

03:45.312 --> 03:46.332
any attention to
that, all right?

03:46.356 --> 03:48.271
Just look at the
design of the house.

03:48.315 --> 03:49.098
You'll love it.

03:49.141 --> 03:50.141
It's so dope.

03:51.753 --> 03:52.753
Okay.

04:21.086 --> 04:23.393
Hey, what are you doing?

04:23.437 --> 04:25.284
Isn't it tradition to
carry you into our new home?

04:25.308 --> 04:26.875
No, babe.

04:26.918 --> 04:28.505
It's a tradition to carry
your bride into a new home.

04:28.529 --> 04:29.965
We ain't married yet.

04:30.008 --> 04:30.879
Whatever, girl.

04:30.922 --> 04:32.315
Lemme just get you in this house

04:32.359 --> 04:35.405
before my back go out on me.

04:35.449 --> 04:36.798
Wow.

04:36.841 --> 04:38.756
I knew you'd like it.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.062
Trust me, baby.

04:40.105 --> 04:41.431
Once I get these
weed plants goin',

04:41.455 --> 04:43.326
we gon' make so
much fucking money

04:43.370 --> 04:45.415
that we can make
this place look dope.

04:45.459 --> 04:48.288
It definitely needs
a thorough cleaning,

04:48.331 --> 04:51.552
but it's amazing.

04:51.595 --> 04:53.162
Yeah.

04:53.205 --> 04:53.945
Yeah.

04:53.989 --> 04:55.860
Oh my god.

04:59.081 --> 05:00.648
This is beautiful.

05:00.691 --> 05:02.302
Told you.

05:02.345 --> 05:04.454
I'm gonna help you with any
remodeling ideas you like.

05:04.478 --> 05:06.088
Help?

05:06.131 --> 05:08.525
Well it would've been helpful
if you came and talked to me

05:08.569 --> 05:10.397
before you went to this auction.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.312
C'mon babe, stop that. But,

05:13.182 --> 05:14.357
I'm so glad you did.

05:14.401 --> 05:17.360
This place is the bomb!

05:18.492 --> 05:21.146
Yeah, it's yo kitchen, girl.

05:36.814 --> 05:39.208
We're not there yet?

05:40.514 --> 05:41.558
Jeez.

05:41.602 --> 05:43.430
There's no service up here.

05:43.473 --> 05:45.127
GPS keeps saying it's loading.

05:46.084 --> 05:47.259
So we're lost?

05:48.391 --> 05:49.391
I guess so.

05:50.524 --> 05:51.568
What?

05:52.656 --> 05:55.180
Aw crap, I don't
have signal either.

05:55.224 --> 05:56.356
What's the address again?

05:58.227 --> 06:01.404
1517 Springcrest Road.

06:06.061 --> 06:07.061
Turn left here.

06:07.715 --> 06:08.759
Left? Left.

06:11.283 --> 06:13.068
Okay but I don't wanna
get lost, Miss Leah.

06:13.111 --> 06:14.374
Trust me.

06:14.417 --> 06:15.375
Something is telling me
this is the way to go.

06:15.418 --> 06:16.418
Just turn left, go.

06:24.819 --> 06:26.386
Okay, now we're on a dirt road.

06:36.744 --> 06:37.744
Oh.

06:38.441 --> 06:40.748
Wait, it says it's right there.

06:41.749 --> 06:42.489
See?

06:42.532 --> 06:43.577
Told ya.

06:44.926 --> 06:46.710
Damn, that was a
lucky guess, Leah.

06:47.581 --> 06:48.799
Call it a woman's intuition.

06:48.843 --> 06:50.410
Happens to me all the time.

07:02.639 --> 07:04.946
This is really not
what I was expecting.

07:04.989 --> 07:06.730
Not at all, no. Wow.

07:07.862 --> 07:08.819
Wow. Did she talk.

07:08.863 --> 07:10.473
Now I'm like excited. What?

07:13.607 --> 07:17.524
Seriously, how did
they get this place?

07:17.567 --> 07:18.829
That is the question.

07:18.873 --> 07:19.569
Seriously.

07:19.613 --> 07:20.614
Okay. Here.

07:21.484 --> 07:22.659
Thank you. Yeah.

07:24.879 --> 07:27.490
Wow, this is crazy.
Here you go, babe.

07:28.926 --> 07:30.580
Oh,. Yeah.

07:30.624 --> 07:31.624
Oh sorry.

07:34.279 --> 07:35.367
It's so big,

07:36.543 --> 07:37.848
wow.

07:37.892 --> 07:38.936
Hey.

07:38.980 --> 07:40.024
Welcome, welcome.

07:41.765 --> 07:43.506
Hey girl! Hi.

07:43.550 --> 07:46.074
These boys
didn't drive you crazy

07:46.117 --> 07:47.815
on the drive up, did they?
Oh, not at all.

07:47.858 --> 07:49.077
My man. They're so sweet

07:49.120 --> 07:50.520
and I slept the
whole way up anyway.

07:51.035 --> 07:52.820
My man.

07:52.863 --> 07:53.734
Whassup, baby?

07:53.777 --> 07:55.083
Yo, I'm so happy to be here.

07:55.126 --> 07:57.607
Man, you didn't tell me
this place was this big.

07:57.651 --> 07:59.106
You said you bought a
little cottage or somethin'.

07:59.130 --> 08:01.437
This is crazy.
Can you believe this?

08:01.481 --> 08:02.307
It's amazing.

08:02.351 --> 08:04.309
Like I had no idea.

08:04.353 --> 08:05.635
This is why I said
it was a steal, bro.

08:05.659 --> 08:06.834
Like it's massive.

08:06.877 --> 08:08.202
I don't know what I
would do without you.

08:08.226 --> 08:09.552
You're gonna help me
decorate everything.

08:09.576 --> 08:10.577
I got you, girl. Super.

08:10.620 --> 08:11.752
I got you, girl.

08:11.795 --> 08:12.622
Yes, great.

08:12.666 --> 08:13.536
Welcome, man. Thanks.

08:13.580 --> 08:14.798
Oh hey. What up, sis?

08:14.842 --> 08:16.583
Hey, sweetie.

08:16.626 --> 08:17.888
Look, thanks so much for coming

08:17.932 --> 08:19.562
and thank you for giving
my girl a ride up here.

08:19.586 --> 08:20.674
Of course.

08:20.717 --> 08:21.675
Grace, this is Dominic.

08:21.718 --> 08:23.024
Hi, beautiful. Hi, Dom.

08:23.067 --> 08:24.547
It's so nice to
finally meet you.

08:24.591 --> 08:25.611
Nice to meet you.
Thanks for having us.

08:25.635 --> 08:26.549
Of course.

08:26.593 --> 08:27.550
Hey, congrats on the new digs.

08:27.594 --> 08:28.682
Y'all are big time now.

08:28.725 --> 08:30.335
Yeah, don't
congratulate us just yet.

08:30.379 --> 08:32.686
Let's see how Marcus
can turn a profit first.

08:33.774 --> 08:35.515
Hey, put that down.

08:35.558 --> 08:36.994
We got everything.

08:37.038 --> 08:38.953
You just show me the house.

08:40.650 --> 08:43.784
This place is amazing.
I'm so happy to be here.

08:43.827 --> 08:45.873
I was a little
worried, not gonna lie.

08:45.916 --> 08:47.875
Did you get lost? Yes, yes.

08:47.918 --> 08:52.140
A little bit?

08:52.183 --> 08:53.620
Wow.

08:53.663 --> 08:56.884
Oh wow, the house
came furnished too?

08:56.927 --> 08:59.713
Yup, the old owners
left everything

08:59.756 --> 09:01.584
except their
personal belongings.

09:01.628 --> 09:02.585
That's cool.

09:02.629 --> 09:03.978
But it hasn't been cleaned yet,

09:04.021 --> 09:06.197
so we're leavin' it
covered for the weekend.

09:06.241 --> 09:09.723
Oh my god, I am a
sucker for fireplaces

09:09.766 --> 09:11.594
and this one is beautiful.

09:11.638 --> 09:12.595
I know, right?

09:12.639 --> 09:13.857
I love it.

09:13.901 --> 09:15.685
It's gonna be so cozy
when it's cold out.

09:15.729 --> 09:17.905
And I can totally see
like a beautiful painting

09:17.948 --> 09:19.602
or a mirror up there.

09:19.646 --> 09:20.734
See?

09:20.777 --> 09:22.039
That's why I called you, girl.

09:22.083 --> 09:23.923
I need your eyes and
interior decorating skills

09:23.954 --> 09:25.434
to help me with this place.

09:25.477 --> 09:29.046
Yup, this house has
definitely a lot of potential.

09:29.090 --> 09:31.353
It is stunning, actually.

09:31.396 --> 09:32.615
I'm sorry, Leah.

09:32.659 --> 09:34.704
I didn't quite get that.

09:34.748 --> 09:36.314
What'd you say there?

09:36.358 --> 09:40.057
I said this house
has a lot of potential.

09:40.101 --> 09:41.537
See, baby?

09:41.581 --> 09:42.712
Whatever.

09:42.756 --> 09:44.584
You're not outta the
doghouse yet, mister.

09:45.889 --> 09:48.631
Lemme show you guys to
your rooms.

09:55.725 --> 09:57.161
Is over here?

09:57.205 --> 09:58.685
I'm trippin' over this place.

10:00.687 --> 10:03.124
It is enormous.

10:04.516 --> 10:05.779
Well here you go, Leah.

10:07.694 --> 10:10.348
The room is small, but
the beds seem comfortable.

10:11.262 --> 10:13.177
I'm sure it's fine, thanks.

10:13.221 --> 10:14.352
Well make yourself at home

10:14.396 --> 10:15.460
and come down
whenever you're ready.

10:15.484 --> 10:17.225
I'll make us skinny margaritas.

10:17.268 --> 10:18.268
Yes, please.

10:19.836 --> 10:21.838
And you two'll be
sleepin' right over here.

10:29.716 --> 10:32.240
And this room is for you guys.

10:32.283 --> 10:33.371
Nice.

10:37.462 --> 10:39.639
Ooh.

10:39.682 --> 10:41.162
Sorry.

10:41.205 --> 10:43.817
The mattress pad and sheets
are new, but not the mattress.

10:46.123 --> 10:48.909
But trust me, we disinfected
the hell out of it.

10:48.952 --> 10:50.693
Hey look, Marcus already told us

10:50.737 --> 10:54.001
there's old furniture in
here, so we're all good.

10:54.044 --> 10:55.742
It's like we're camping.

10:55.785 --> 10:59.354
No it's more like
glamping, honey.

10:59.397 --> 11:00.790
Hey, thank you for everything.

11:00.834 --> 11:04.054
No, thank you
guys for being here.

11:04.098 --> 11:07.797
I swear if you weren't here,
I might kill your best friend.

11:07.841 --> 11:09.146
I now have hope that this

11:09.190 --> 11:10.757
might not be such
a bad investment.

11:10.800 --> 11:11.714
Are you kidding me?

11:11.758 --> 11:13.673
This house is incredible.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.718
You guys are definitely
gonna make that money

11:15.762 --> 11:18.765
with the Mary Jane.

11:18.808 --> 11:20.418
Well let's hope so.

11:20.462 --> 11:21.898
Look, relax a bit.

11:21.942 --> 11:24.901
Marcus is gonna start barbecuing
soon and he got tequila.

11:24.945 --> 11:26.337
Hey!

11:26.381 --> 11:27.774
So make sure you hydrate.

11:27.817 --> 11:29.558
Hell yeah, mama.

11:30.907 --> 11:31.952
Thanks, Grace. Okay.

11:36.391 --> 11:38.828
Hey, you're gonna have
to chill with the remarks.

11:40.525 --> 11:41.439
What?

11:41.483 --> 11:42.397
I didn't even say anything.

11:42.440 --> 11:43.877
You didn't have to.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.052
Your face said it all.

11:46.662 --> 11:49.143
Look, my boy's trying really
hard to get his girl happy

11:49.186 --> 11:52.712
about this house, so try
to be optimistic okay?

11:53.756 --> 11:55.410
I am being optimistic.

11:55.453 --> 11:57.542
I just told her how much
I liked the fireplace.

11:58.892 --> 11:59.893
Good.

12:01.024 --> 12:02.504
Keep it up, playboy.

12:05.202 --> 12:06.943
Now roll me one of
those signature joints

12:06.987 --> 12:08.466
so I can decompress.

12:09.598 --> 12:11.556
We both need to decompress.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.471
I know that's right.

12:13.515 --> 12:15.082
Here is your prescription.

12:15.865 --> 12:16.953
Ooh, shank you.

12:19.216 --> 12:20.216
Boop.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.046
A?

12:23.090 --> 12:25.005
I mean it ain't gonna
light itself, babe.

13:13.270 --> 13:18.058
So this motherfucker decides
it's time for payback

13:18.101 --> 13:19.886
two fuckin' years later.

13:19.929 --> 13:20.887
Told you I never forget.

13:20.930 --> 13:21.975
That's right.

13:22.018 --> 13:23.280
So we're all in the auditorium

13:23.324 --> 13:25.935
for a rally right
before the game

13:25.979 --> 13:27.807
and this fool is
in the front row.

13:27.850 --> 13:30.897
He's clappin', he's
hollerin' all loud.

13:30.940 --> 13:33.856
As soon as the guy
gets up to speak,

13:33.900 --> 13:36.206
you see Marcus' whole
demeanor change.

13:36.250 --> 13:38.861
His eyes get all dark and shit.

13:38.905 --> 13:42.125
And not two minutes
in to the speech,

13:42.169 --> 13:45.172
he gets up, he runs
over to this sucker

13:45.215 --> 13:48.044
and pulls his pants
down around his ankles.

13:48.088 --> 13:50.568
Everybody saw his
tiny little pinky dick

13:50.612 --> 13:51.961
and busted out laughin'.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.964
Yo, that shit was hilarious!

13:56.052 --> 13:58.054
That poor guy.

13:58.098 --> 13:59.926
That is so awful, Marcus.

13:59.969 --> 14:01.207
Is that why you didn't
graduate high school?

14:01.231 --> 14:02.798
Hold up, hold up.

14:02.842 --> 14:03.993
I graduated; I just wasn't
able to walk the stage

14:04.017 --> 14:05.845
for my diploma, but
I didn't give a fuck.

14:05.888 --> 14:09.326
That prick was so damn cocky
and bullying everybody.

14:09.370 --> 14:11.241
Did you get your
ass kicked after that?

14:11.285 --> 14:13.896
Yeah, by his mama.

14:18.335 --> 14:20.598
Yeah, she beat my ass that day.

14:20.642 --> 14:23.297
I mean he did too later that
summer, but I didn't care.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.014
I mean I feel like I wasn't
gettin' payback just for me,

14:25.038 --> 14:26.866
but for the whole damn school.

14:26.909 --> 14:27.779
Yes. You know what I'm sayin'?

14:27.823 --> 14:29.781
Like fuckin' Brian Miller, man.

14:29.825 --> 14:31.566
Yeah, jackass.

14:31.609 --> 14:35.787
The little-dick jackass.

14:35.831 --> 14:37.964
Oh no no, I can't
take another one.

14:38.007 --> 14:39.661
I'm drunk, guys.

14:39.704 --> 14:41.837
Hey, you have to. Yes.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.926
Plus, I'm faded already too.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.145
Come on, Leah.

14:45.188 --> 14:46.668
I got you a big one.

14:46.711 --> 14:49.932
Fine, but you are
cleanin' up my vomit later.

14:49.976 --> 14:50.890
Cheers.

14:50.933 --> 14:51.978
Is it like that?

14:52.021 --> 14:53.936
I didn't know that. Cheers.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.024
Salud!

14:59.855 --> 15:00.855
Brian!

15:02.162 --> 15:03.206
I got to piss like crazy.

15:03.250 --> 15:04.468
Where's the bathroom again?

15:04.512 --> 15:05.663
Babe, can you show
him where it is?

15:05.687 --> 15:06.906
I got you, man.

15:06.949 --> 15:07.949
C'mon.

15:08.777 --> 15:09.909
Oh my god.

15:11.562 --> 15:14.783
Come on.
All right, end of the hall.

15:14.826 --> 15:16.916
Yeah. To the left.

15:16.959 --> 15:17.959
Got it.

15:31.017 --> 15:34.063
Shit, it's a closet.

15:40.069 --> 15:42.028
I know you have some
embarrassing stories

15:42.071 --> 15:43.072
about Phil too.

15:43.116 --> 15:45.553
I wanna know everything.

15:46.946 --> 15:47.946
Leah?

15:59.784 --> 16:00.784
Oh shit.

16:01.873 --> 16:02.962
My bad, bro.

16:03.005 --> 16:04.528
Had to get a towel.

16:04.572 --> 16:06.791
Your new boyfriend spilled
his beer all over me.

16:06.835 --> 16:08.880
He did? Yeah.

16:08.924 --> 16:10.186
It's all good though, man.

16:10.230 --> 16:11.971
'Bout to take this
shit off anyway.

16:13.059 --> 16:14.364
You know what they say,

16:14.408 --> 16:17.019
"It ain't a party 'til
somebody spills a drink."

16:17.063 --> 16:20.153
I think
this party's over anyway.

16:20.196 --> 16:20.980
What?

16:21.023 --> 16:21.763
It's like 10:30.

16:21.806 --> 16:23.156
Yeah, I know.

16:23.199 --> 16:25.288
But me, I'm not tryin' to
be hungover for tomorrow.

16:25.332 --> 16:27.856
You know Grace about
to put my ass to work.

16:27.899 --> 16:29.031
She sure is.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.119
You know she is.

16:31.512 --> 16:32.774
C'mon, man.

16:32.817 --> 16:33.817
Gee.

16:34.776 --> 16:36.212
Your hair, I just love it. Yeah.

16:39.259 --> 16:42.131
Marcus tell you I
spilled a beer on him?

16:42.175 --> 16:45.178
I'm such an idiot. He did.

16:45.221 --> 16:47.006
I was way too
animated, tellin' a story

16:47.049 --> 16:49.008
and just knocks
you right into it.

16:49.051 --> 16:50.487
Seriously, bro.

16:50.531 --> 16:51.793
It's all good.

16:51.836 --> 16:53.118
I'm 'bout to change
and go to bed anyway.

16:53.142 --> 16:55.101
Yes, we should all go to bed

16:55.144 --> 16:56.252
because we have a
busy day tomorrow

16:56.276 --> 16:57.842
gettin' this place in order.

16:59.105 --> 17:02.108
Actually I'm
exhausted from the drive,

17:02.151 --> 17:04.545
so we're ready for bed too.

17:04.588 --> 17:05.894
I brought our coffee pot with us

17:05.936 --> 17:07.175
and I got some good
stuff for breakfast.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.070
Ooh, I can help.

17:09.115 --> 17:11.117
I have an inner Ina
Garten inside of me

17:11.160 --> 17:12.770
just dyin' to get out.

17:12.814 --> 17:14.729
Ooh, wonderful.

17:14.771 --> 17:16.599
Seven a.m., you guys.

17:16.644 --> 17:17.384
Oh c'mon, babe.

17:17.426 --> 17:18.166
Seriously?

17:18.211 --> 17:19.212
More like nine please?

17:19.255 --> 17:20.126
C'mon.

17:20.169 --> 17:21.387
It's the weekend, come on.

17:21.431 --> 17:24.130
Fine, nine it is. Wow.

17:25.653 --> 17:28.047
There's some bottles of
water in the fridge, you guys.

17:28.089 --> 17:29.439
You'll thank me in the morning.

17:29.483 --> 17:33.226
Thank you, babe.
Thank you, Grace.

17:43.671 --> 17:46.239
So what do you think of Dominic?

17:47.196 --> 17:48.241
He's cool.

17:50.199 --> 17:51.853
Phil seems to really like him.

17:53.811 --> 17:54.986
Yeah, I can see that.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.076
He's really nice.

17:58.338 --> 18:00.427
As long as Phil's
happy, I'm happy.

18:06.172 --> 18:07.172
So.

18:08.304 --> 18:11.655
Are you happy or are
you still mad at me?

18:15.311 --> 18:16.573
Still mad at you.

18:18.836 --> 18:22.927
Baby, this house was
a steal at the auction.

18:22.971 --> 18:24.771
All I was tryin' to do
was invest in somethin'

18:24.799 --> 18:27.497
to make us some money for
our future, that's all.

18:27.541 --> 18:29.238
I know that.

18:29.282 --> 18:32.285
But you have to talk to me
about these things, okay?

18:32.328 --> 18:33.329
We're a team,

18:34.896 --> 18:37.290
so I wanna be a part of all
the decisions from now on.

18:39.466 --> 18:40.466
Got it.

18:42.686 --> 18:43.686
Understood.

18:45.036 --> 18:46.951
Now get over here
and gimme some booty.

18:48.214 --> 18:50.172
Lemme clean up first.

18:50.216 --> 18:51.652
I'll be right back.

19:02.271 --> 19:03.271
Hurry up.

19:50.363 --> 19:51.363
Marcus!

20:07.510 --> 20:08.510
Marcus.

22:42.448 --> 22:43.666
The hell is this?

22:48.889 --> 22:50.325
Hey girl. Hey.

22:51.587 --> 22:53.589
Somebody woke up on the
wrong side of the bed.

22:55.286 --> 22:56.200
I'm sorry, guys.

22:56.244 --> 22:58.464
I just didn't sleep well at all.

22:58.507 --> 23:00.161
Oh, you too?

23:00.204 --> 23:02.293
Marcus couldn't sleep either.

23:02.337 --> 23:04.861
I just had a really bad dream.

23:04.905 --> 23:06.428
All that alcohol.

23:06.472 --> 23:08.865
I always have crazy
dreams when I'm drunk too.

23:08.909 --> 23:10.824
It was just terrible.

23:10.867 --> 23:11.912
You'll feel better

23:11.955 --> 23:14.436
once you eat somethin'.
Yes, eat.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.046
I need you today.

23:16.090 --> 23:18.266
I brought all of these
with me to give you an idea

23:18.309 --> 23:20.442
of some of the things
I wanna do in here.

23:20.486 --> 23:23.967
Okay I'm sure once I
eat, I'll feel better.

23:24.011 --> 23:24.751
Let's do it.

23:24.794 --> 23:26.840
Yay, I'm so excited.

23:26.883 --> 23:29.103
Lemme grab these plates.

23:29.146 --> 23:30.974
Can you tell the boys
that breakfast is ready?

23:31.018 --> 23:31.845
They're outside.

23:31.888 --> 23:32.888
Sure.

23:35.501 --> 23:37.546
Strike. Damn it, man!

23:41.594 --> 23:43.639
Man, you cheatin' bro.

23:46.250 --> 23:47.991
Strike. Damn it!

23:49.689 --> 23:52.561
Hey guys, breakfast is ready.

23:52.605 --> 23:54.650
Oh hey, Leah. Hey, Leah.

23:54.694 --> 23:56.739
C'mon man, one more bro.

23:56.783 --> 23:57.958
One more. All right.

23:59.568 --> 24:01.728
All right man, don't be mad
when I strike your ass out.

24:15.671 --> 24:17.281
Yeah, baby.

24:17.325 --> 24:18.631
Hell yeah!

24:18.674 --> 24:21.198
That's what I'm
talkin' 'bout, P!

24:21.242 --> 24:21.982
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.

24:22.025 --> 24:22.765
Why you mad, P?

24:22.809 --> 24:23.549
Don't be mad.

24:23.592 --> 24:24.767
Don't be mad, P.

24:24.811 --> 24:26.049
Finally, I thought I was playin'

24:26.073 --> 24:27.509
with my grandma
there for a minute.

24:27.553 --> 24:28.467
Oh really?

24:28.510 --> 24:29.511
Okay.

24:29.555 --> 24:30.556
Your grandma, huh?

24:30.599 --> 24:31.600
Yeah, my grandma. Okay.

24:31.644 --> 24:32.751
Please, you know my grandma.

24:32.775 --> 24:34.560
I know, she's humongous.

24:34.603 --> 24:36.605
Humongous?
Yeah, but she's got a donk.

24:39.260 --> 24:41.741
She's a good cook.
She can cook really good.

24:48.574 --> 24:49.574
That looks good.

24:50.924 --> 24:52.534
Ooh okay, babe.

24:52.578 --> 24:53.666
Look at you.

24:53.709 --> 24:54.754
Damn, this look good.

24:54.797 --> 24:55.537
Thank you.

24:55.581 --> 24:56.799
Don't thank me.

24:56.843 --> 24:58.453
Dominic basically
did everything.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.368
I practically took
over her kitchen.

25:00.411 --> 25:01.108
Sorry, Grace.

25:01.151 --> 25:02.849
Please, I loved it.

25:02.892 --> 25:04.212
Look, we're gettin'
pizza tonight,

25:04.241 --> 25:05.610
but you can help me
make dinner tomorrow

25:05.634 --> 25:06.679
since you love to cook.

25:06.722 --> 25:07.722
My pleasure.

25:08.594 --> 25:09.682
Whoa, Dominic.

25:09.725 --> 25:10.833
I don't know what you
put in these eggs,

25:10.857 --> 25:12.380
but they're the
best I've ever had.

25:13.599 --> 25:15.011
All the praise goes
to Barefoot Contessa.

25:15.035 --> 25:16.602
Her recipes never fail.

25:18.778 --> 25:21.563
Oh no, none of that.

25:21.607 --> 25:23.565
You need to drink
more coffee, Marcus.

25:23.609 --> 25:27.177
I don't know, I'm
just so tired though.

25:27.221 --> 25:28.222
You mean hungover.

25:29.876 --> 25:33.009
Nah man, I couldn't
sleep with all the noise.

25:33.053 --> 25:35.577
I'm still surprised
none of y'all heard it.

25:35.621 --> 25:37.187
Leah, you didn't hear it?

25:37.231 --> 25:38.537
I didn't, no.

25:40.016 --> 25:41.235
That shit is crazy.

25:41.278 --> 25:44.586
It was so loud like
scratchin' or somethin'.

25:45.674 --> 25:46.695
I think we might have mice.

25:46.719 --> 25:48.242
Mice? Yeah.

25:50.331 --> 25:52.507
You guys need to
check that out today.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.161
I can't live with
rodents in here.

25:55.684 --> 25:57.730
I mean maybe there's
some traps or somethin'

25:57.773 --> 25:59.470
in the shed out there.

25:59.514 --> 26:01.647
Don't worry, we take care of it.

26:01.690 --> 26:05.651
Oh no no no, I don't do
mice and sheds and stuff.

26:05.694 --> 26:07.000
Just kitchens.

26:08.175 --> 26:11.526
Fine, us real
men will tackle it.

26:13.397 --> 26:16.052
Real men?

26:16.096 --> 26:18.054
I got your real man right here.

26:23.799 --> 26:25.192
Yeah, man. The hell is this?

26:25.235 --> 26:26.236
I have no idea.

26:28.282 --> 26:29.651
That shit has a little
spring thing on the door

26:29.675 --> 26:30.980
for opening and closing.

26:31.024 --> 26:32.242
That's pretty cool.

26:32.286 --> 26:33.568
Wow, there's a
lotta shit in here.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.158
I know, right?

26:35.202 --> 26:37.639
We need to get rid of
it before Grace sees it.

26:37.683 --> 26:38.727
Definitely.

26:38.771 --> 26:39.641
Then maybe you could turn this

26:39.685 --> 26:41.121
into a game room or somethin'.

26:41.164 --> 26:42.644
Yeah, maybe a workout room.

26:42.688 --> 26:45.647
My punching bag, boxin'
equipment and shit.

26:45.691 --> 26:47.011
Look at you.
You know, I could be.

26:47.910 --> 26:49.129
Damn it, man.

26:49.172 --> 26:50.652
Who am I kiddin', bro?

26:50.696 --> 26:51.716
This room's gonna be whatever
Grace wants it to be.

26:51.740 --> 26:53.307
Exactly. What the fuck?

26:53.350 --> 26:55.526
Exactly, knowin' that
is half the battle.

26:57.790 --> 26:59.705
Shit!

26:59.748 --> 27:00.662
That fuckin' spring thing.

27:00.706 --> 27:01.663
Hold on, bro.

27:01.707 --> 27:02.707
I got a flashlight.

27:03.709 --> 27:04.709
There we go.

27:05.711 --> 27:07.669
I wouldn't even fuckin'.

27:07.713 --> 27:09.715
What we lookin' at?
So they left you a horse.

27:09.758 --> 27:11.107
Cute.

27:12.718 --> 27:14.110
That's funny?

27:14.154 --> 27:15.827
How are you gonna
find anything up in here?

27:15.851 --> 27:17.766
We just fuckin'
look at everything.

27:17.810 --> 27:18.854
Fuckin' see.

27:20.334 --> 27:23.076
Shit, so much
random shit in here.

27:23.903 --> 27:24.773
Oh okay, okay.

27:24.817 --> 27:25.731
Hold this for me, brother.

27:25.774 --> 27:27.689
I got you. Thanks, man.

27:31.693 --> 27:35.392
A mixture of kid toys and shit.

27:38.961 --> 27:41.660
What happened?

27:41.703 --> 27:42.724
Where's the flashlight, bro?

27:42.748 --> 27:43.662
I dropped it.

27:43.705 --> 27:44.837
I'm tryin' to find it now.

27:45.925 --> 27:46.969
God, dude.

27:49.885 --> 27:51.278
Oh man, c'mon bro.

27:59.721 --> 28:00.417
Phil?

28:00.461 --> 28:01.461
Yeah.

28:15.868 --> 28:17.086
You find it now?

28:17.130 --> 28:18.130
I got it.

28:19.828 --> 28:22.091
What'd you see, man;
A rat or somethin'?

28:22.135 --> 28:23.789
Nah, I thought I saw somethin'.

28:23.832 --> 28:25.834
But I was trippin'.

28:25.878 --> 28:26.835
Here.

28:26.879 --> 28:29.142
Maybe there's
somethin' in there.

28:29.969 --> 28:30.970
All right.

28:34.800 --> 28:37.106
Look, this is what
I was talking about

28:37.150 --> 28:38.760
for your bedroom.

28:38.804 --> 28:41.763
It's rustic chic, but it
still has those warm tones

28:41.807 --> 28:42.764
so you can relax.

28:42.808 --> 28:45.288
Yes, I love that.

28:45.332 --> 28:47.726
Yeah, with those curtains too.

28:47.769 --> 28:48.639
Cute.

28:48.683 --> 28:49.902
It's gonna look so good,

28:49.945 --> 28:52.513
plus it's gonna help you
guys get in the mood.

28:52.556 --> 28:53.862
Yeah we'll need it, girl.

28:53.906 --> 28:56.691
You know, Marcus
is like a old man.

28:56.735 --> 28:59.781
He passes out after five minutes
of being in bed nowadays.

28:59.825 --> 29:02.653
Oh no, really? Yes, girl.

29:02.697 --> 29:03.785
I tease him and tell him

29:03.829 --> 29:05.284
he's not supposed to
be actin' like that

29:05.308 --> 29:07.658
until after we're married.

29:07.702 --> 29:09.486
Yeah, that is true.

29:10.966 --> 29:12.794
But enough about me,

29:12.838 --> 29:14.840
how are things with you
in the love department?

29:14.883 --> 29:16.755
Nonexistent.

29:17.668 --> 29:18.668
Really? Mm-hmm.

29:19.845 --> 29:22.717
So you haven't been
with anyone since Kevin?

29:22.761 --> 29:23.761
Nope.

29:24.501 --> 29:25.764
My god, Leah.

29:26.982 --> 29:28.027
That was two years ago.

29:28.070 --> 29:29.245
Don't remind me.

29:30.203 --> 29:31.203
Do you miss him?

29:32.814 --> 29:33.989
Not anymore.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.515
And what about sex?

29:38.559 --> 29:40.430
Please tell me you're
at least gettin' some.

29:40.474 --> 29:43.216
Nope, not that either.

29:43.259 --> 29:44.608
In two years?

29:45.566 --> 29:46.566
I know.

29:47.786 --> 29:50.092
Did I just hear
you say two years?

29:50.136 --> 29:52.399
Whoa, you eavesdropping on us?

29:52.442 --> 29:54.662
No, I was going around the house

29:54.705 --> 29:57.708
tryin' to find a place to get
reception so I can Snapchat,

29:57.752 --> 29:59.885
but there's not a single
fucking signal in here.

29:59.928 --> 30:01.800
I know, sorry.

30:01.843 --> 30:04.846
We're havin' someone set up
the cable and wifi next week.

30:08.154 --> 30:12.811
Okay two years without
sex is unacceptable, honey.

30:12.854 --> 30:14.116
What's really goin' on?

30:14.160 --> 30:15.988
Exactly, that's
what I wanna know.

30:16.031 --> 30:20.688
Look if I had a choice, I'd
be having sex all the time.

30:20.731 --> 30:21.994
But I don't.

30:22.037 --> 30:26.085
Ooh yes you do, girl.
You're a hot piece of ass.

30:26.128 --> 30:27.826
Don't give us that shit.

30:27.869 --> 30:30.480
I've been busy getting
my business off the ground.

30:30.524 --> 30:32.656
I've had more than
eight clients this year

30:32.700 --> 30:34.441
and thankfully, it's been great.

30:34.484 --> 30:35.834
Been super busy.

30:35.877 --> 30:38.053
Babe, you've got to find time

30:38.097 --> 30:39.707
in your life for yourself too.

30:40.926 --> 30:42.579
And now you sound
like my mother.

30:42.623 --> 30:45.974
Listen, when the right guy
comes along, I'll be so ready.

30:46.018 --> 30:49.935
But until then, I'm focusing
on me and my business, okay?

30:51.937 --> 30:54.983
Well at least get
yourself a vibrator.

30:55.027 --> 30:56.680
Who says I don't have one?

30:56.724 --> 31:00.206
Ooh, I don't know.

31:00.249 --> 31:01.642
Oh hey, guys.

31:01.685 --> 31:02.924
Thought you were
never comin' back.

31:02.948 --> 31:04.166
Bad news.

31:04.210 --> 31:06.473
There's no traps
in the greenhouse.

31:06.516 --> 31:08.170
We have to go in
town to get some.

31:08.214 --> 31:09.650
I'll roll with you if you want.

31:09.693 --> 31:10.999
Well, I wanna go too.

31:11.043 --> 31:11.826
See the town.

31:11.870 --> 31:12.914
All right, cool.

31:12.958 --> 31:14.350
So y'all wanna go now?

31:14.394 --> 31:16.004
We could set some
traps before dark.

31:16.048 --> 31:17.440
Yeah, let's all go.

31:17.484 --> 31:18.964
I just got to get my shoes.

31:19.965 --> 31:21.662
Let's see what's
in here right quick.

31:24.534 --> 31:25.534
Random lady.

31:26.493 --> 31:27.973
Wow, they're pretty.

31:29.235 --> 31:30.235
Oh my god.

31:31.367 --> 31:32.934
What? What is it?

31:32.978 --> 31:34.283
Remember when I told you

31:34.327 --> 31:36.198
I had a really bad
dream last night?

31:36.242 --> 31:37.547
Yeah?

31:37.591 --> 31:39.810
This young girl was in my dream.

31:40.637 --> 31:41.812
Get the fuck outta here.

31:41.856 --> 31:42.770
No way.

31:42.813 --> 31:44.250
I swear to god.

31:44.293 --> 31:47.470
She was in my dream and
it was creepy as hell.

31:48.471 --> 31:49.951
What happened in the dream?

31:50.865 --> 31:52.214
She was living in this house.

31:52.258 --> 31:54.825
But the house was different.

31:56.218 --> 31:58.438
That don't sound creepy to me.

31:58.481 --> 32:00.005
It got creepy after that.

32:00.048 --> 32:03.530
She was painting and
then she got all scary.

32:04.444 --> 32:05.488
I don't remember.

32:07.142 --> 32:09.362
Guys, I'm serious.

32:09.405 --> 32:11.059
She was in my dream.

32:12.017 --> 32:13.017
I believe you.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.063
It's just weird as hell.

32:17.979 --> 32:21.374
Look let's go into town, get
the traps and grab some lunch.

32:21.417 --> 32:23.419
I wanna see what this
city has to offer.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.684
And I wanna get a tour of the
grounds before it gets dark.

32:27.728 --> 32:28.903
All right,.

32:28.947 --> 32:32.994
Let's do it.

32:34.343 --> 32:37.651
All right, let's
just get outta here.

32:46.834 --> 32:48.923
- Where are you takin' us?
- You?

32:50.707 --> 32:52.840
Damn, this is almost as
big as the house itself.

32:52.883 --> 32:54.015
It's crazy, bro.

32:55.190 --> 32:56.670
It was probably, dude.

32:58.063 --> 32:59.716
Actual greenhouse. Yeah.

32:59.760 --> 33:00.867
It's like actually green.
Of course

33:00.891 --> 33:02.110
I can help you with the door.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.985
This right here is where
we gon' make our millions.

33:10.336 --> 33:12.120
Gonna use that area over there;

33:12.164 --> 33:13.750
It'll turn it into like
a greenhouse, you know?

33:13.774 --> 33:15.012
We'll grow the best
weed in California.

33:15.036 --> 33:17.038
Yeah. That's what's up.

33:17.082 --> 33:18.711
Do you already have
all your seeds and stuff?

33:18.735 --> 33:20.128
Nah but you know, I get 'em.

33:20.172 --> 33:22.435
I'm takin' an online course
on how to grow right now.

33:22.478 --> 33:23.436
It seemed pretty easy.

33:23.479 --> 33:24.350
Hold up.

33:24.393 --> 33:25.612
You don't even smoke weed.

33:25.655 --> 33:26.613
How you gonna grow it?

33:26.656 --> 33:28.006
It's agriculture, man.

33:28.049 --> 33:29.050
I'll figure it out.

33:29.094 --> 33:30.356
Well you are in Ojai,

33:30.399 --> 33:31.724
where some of the
best pot comes from.

33:31.748 --> 33:33.098
See?

33:33.141 --> 33:37.058
Look man, I can help you
out with this if you want.

33:37.102 --> 33:38.016
I mean if you need
a business partner.

33:38.059 --> 33:39.495
Get the fuck outta here, man.

33:39.539 --> 33:42.063
You are the last person I
need around my weed plants.

33:42.107 --> 33:43.021
Oh, it's like that?

33:43.064 --> 33:43.804
Yeah, it's like that.

33:43.847 --> 33:45.110
Okay.

33:45.153 --> 33:46.348
I'm just sayin' I'm
here if you need me.

33:46.372 --> 33:47.634
Okay.

33:47.677 --> 33:50.506
Or if you need someone
to test that shit out.

33:50.550 --> 33:52.160
We got you, right?

33:52.204 --> 33:54.554
If he needs somebody to test
that shit out right, babe?

33:56.164 --> 33:58.123
Hey, what are you
lookin' at over there?

33:58.166 --> 34:01.082
Oh nothin', it's
just a lotta wood.

34:01.126 --> 34:02.344
I know, right?

34:02.388 --> 34:04.042
It came with the property too.

34:04.999 --> 34:06.218
Hey, you guys should bring

34:06.261 --> 34:07.132
some of that wood
up to the house.

34:07.175 --> 34:08.524
We could use it by the fireplace

34:08.568 --> 34:09.936
'cause you know it's
gonna get cold later.

34:09.960 --> 34:10.960
For sure.

34:17.228 --> 34:19.187
Not now.

34:19.231 --> 34:21.972
Let's go and try and get the
traps before it gets dark.

34:22.799 --> 34:23.799
All right.

34:30.329 --> 34:32.112
"Not now."

34:32.157 --> 34:34.768
Man, Grace got
you pussy whipped.

34:34.811 --> 34:37.074
Yup, just the way I like it.

34:38.641 --> 34:39.835
You don't know what
you're missin', bro.

34:39.860 --> 34:41.340
Get off me, fool.

34:41.382 --> 34:44.299
Gracie come to me, baby!

34:58.792 --> 35:00.010
Hello.

35:00.054 --> 35:02.100
Hi, I'm Grace and
this is my fiance Marcus

35:02.143 --> 35:03.188
and these are our friends.

35:03.231 --> 35:05.407
We just moved into
the house here.

35:05.451 --> 35:06.451
Oh wow.

35:08.497 --> 35:10.151
Welcome.

35:10.195 --> 35:12.545
Listen, you happen to have
a card on you or somethin'?

35:12.588 --> 35:13.868
We're gonna need a good gardener

35:13.894 --> 35:15.263
or someone to help us
out with all this land.

35:15.287 --> 35:16.287
Sorry, no.

35:17.593 --> 35:19.552
Okay, do you know
anyone around here

35:19.595 --> 35:21.380
that may be able to
help us out then?

35:22.859 --> 35:24.122
No, I don't.

35:24.165 --> 35:25.732
You are a gardener, aren't you?

35:27.168 --> 35:28.168
Yes, I am.

35:29.214 --> 35:31.409
Listen man, is there a reason
why you can't help us out?

35:31.433 --> 35:33.827
Look, I'm just you
know, really busy.

35:33.870 --> 35:35.176
I have a lotta clients.

35:35.220 --> 35:36.849
Do you know who might've
worked with the people

35:36.873 --> 35:37.831
that lived here before?

35:37.874 --> 35:39.224
No.

35:39.267 --> 35:40.984
Did you even know the
people that lived here before?

35:41.008 --> 35:45.099
I didn't know them,
but I heard about them.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.143
Heard of them?

35:46.753 --> 35:48.233
What do you mean?

35:49.321 --> 35:52.889
I meant I heard
that they lived here.

35:55.327 --> 35:57.720
Okay look, I really got to go.

36:01.681 --> 36:02.681
Okay.

36:14.650 --> 36:17.436
Is it me or was
that guy kinda weird?

36:17.479 --> 36:20.961
Yeah, he was interesting.

36:22.267 --> 36:23.920
Do you think he was
crazy or something?

36:23.964 --> 36:26.184
I don't know, just weird.

36:27.533 --> 36:28.490
And did you hear what he said

36:28.534 --> 36:30.710
about the people
that lived here?

36:30.753 --> 36:32.277
He heard they lived here.

36:33.408 --> 36:35.889
Maybe he just meant he
heard of who they were.

36:37.282 --> 36:40.894
I don't know, somethin'
was off about him.

36:40.937 --> 36:42.069
I know that's right.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.332
Let's go.

36:46.421 --> 36:49.424
Let's get tequila.
Yeah, tequila.

36:52.601 --> 36:54.995
C'mon, babe. You got this.

36:56.997 --> 36:59.217
Doin' it, baby.
Doin' this for you.

36:59.260 --> 37:01.349
Yes. Baby.

37:01.393 --> 37:02.393
Yeah!

37:03.351 --> 37:04.439
That right there.

37:04.483 --> 37:05.571
Woo. Nice.

37:07.137 --> 37:08.356
All right Marcus, you're up.

37:08.400 --> 37:10.489
Okay okay, let's
see what we got.

37:10.532 --> 37:12.012
I'ma go with this one.

37:12.055 --> 37:12.795
C'mon, get out.

37:12.839 --> 37:14.101
Get out.

37:14.144 --> 37:15.276
Yes.

37:15.320 --> 37:16.321
Two for you, baby!

37:16.364 --> 37:17.278
Your turn.

37:17.322 --> 37:18.236
Wait, whoa whoa.

37:18.279 --> 37:19.541
Why are you guys picking on me?

37:19.585 --> 37:21.891
You just gave me a
shot before Grace!

37:21.935 --> 37:24.242
Oh no it's nothin'
personal, man.

37:24.285 --> 37:25.610
I'm a gentleman,
so I'm not gonna be

37:25.634 --> 37:27.070
handin' out drinks
to the ladies.

37:27.114 --> 37:28.246
You just give me a shot.

37:28.289 --> 37:29.397
I'm not gonna be handin' out

37:29.421 --> 37:30.248
drinks to the ladies anymore.

37:30.291 --> 37:31.901
Babe, you don't let me finish.

37:33.033 --> 37:34.382
Just take your shot, Dom.

37:34.426 --> 37:36.079
C'mon, you're slowin'
down the game.

37:36.863 --> 37:38.430
Whatever.

37:38.473 --> 37:39.929
I told you guys it's literally
impossible to get me drunk,

37:39.953 --> 37:43.348
so you can just ganging up
on me if you want, all right?

37:43.391 --> 37:44.914
Yeah!

37:44.958 --> 37:46.916
Who the fuck is that?

37:49.005 --> 37:50.355
I don't know.

37:50.398 --> 37:52.313
Maybe they were
just turning around.

37:52.357 --> 37:54.054
Seriously, turnin' around

37:54.097 --> 37:56.317
all the way up
the damn driveway?

37:56.361 --> 37:58.319
You guys should keep
that gate locked.

37:58.363 --> 37:59.451
Probably right.

38:00.756 --> 38:02.149
Whose turn is it?

38:03.063 --> 38:04.063
Mine.

38:05.674 --> 38:09.939
Let's see what I do.

38:11.376 --> 38:12.725
Two for you, baby.

38:12.768 --> 38:15.293
No way, you guys are
definitely cheating.

38:15.336 --> 38:18.948
No fucking way! Come on.

38:18.992 --> 38:20.341
C'mon, take it.

38:20.385 --> 38:24.171
Shot, shot, shot,
shot, shot, shot, shot.

38:25.215 --> 38:26.215
Yeah!

38:27.479 --> 38:28.958
'Attaboy.
That's how you take it.

38:41.928 --> 38:43.471
So are you gonna tell
me why you're upset

38:43.495 --> 38:44.365
or are you just
gonna stand there,

38:44.409 --> 38:46.324
give me the silent treatment?

38:48.804 --> 38:51.154
Do I have to tell you
what I'm upset about?

38:51.198 --> 38:52.480
Well I'm not a
mind reader, Dominic.

38:52.504 --> 38:55.245
So please, by all means.

38:56.551 --> 38:58.553
How 'bout you and your
high school sweetheart,

38:58.597 --> 38:59.902
Marcus, down there?

38:59.946 --> 39:01.184
Oh my god, high
school sweetheart?

39:01.208 --> 39:02.252
He's my best friend!

39:02.296 --> 39:03.558
My oldest friend.

39:04.429 --> 39:06.126
We should be best friends.

39:06.169 --> 39:08.389
Are you really gonna make
this a competition now?

39:08.433 --> 39:09.956
You're my boyfriend.

39:09.999 --> 39:11.325
Now of course you're
gonna turn this

39:11.349 --> 39:12.741
into pitting me... okay,

39:12.785 --> 39:15.570
I would just never treat you
like that with my friends

39:15.614 --> 39:16.832
and you know it. Oh, god.

39:16.876 --> 39:18.070
I've been nothing
but good to you.

39:18.094 --> 39:18.965
Yeah because you're so perfect.

39:19.008 --> 39:20.008
I know.

39:21.010 --> 39:23.535
Hey, stay outta their business.

39:23.578 --> 39:24.797
Shh, be quiet.

39:24.840 --> 39:25.840
Can't hear.

39:27.452 --> 39:29.410
You shouldn't be listenin'.

39:29.454 --> 39:31.760
You are turning this into
something that it's not.

39:31.804 --> 39:33.414
We were just fucking with you.

39:33.458 --> 39:35.068
It's like an initiation!

39:35.111 --> 39:36.524
It's something we used to
do back in the neighborhood.

39:36.548 --> 39:38.463
Well excuse the hell outta me

39:38.506 --> 39:40.682
for not understanding the
rules of your neighborhood.

39:40.726 --> 39:41.944
Fuck this.

39:41.988 --> 39:42.510
You could've at
least warned me, Phil!

39:42.554 --> 39:43.511
Warn you?

39:43.555 --> 39:44.860
You need a warning?

39:44.904 --> 39:46.360
It's a simple fucking
game, what's the big deal?

39:46.384 --> 39:47.341
Jesus. And any fucking time

39:47.385 --> 39:48.579
you open your mouth around him,

39:48.603 --> 39:50.692
I don't even understand
who you are anymore.

39:50.736 --> 39:52.433
Seriously, Dominic? Yes!

39:52.477 --> 39:53.391
Fucking relax!

39:53.434 --> 39:55.436
We were just fucking with you!

39:55.480 --> 39:58.265
Turning this into a fuckin'
now you're a victim again.

39:58.308 --> 39:59.701
Typical.

39:59.745 --> 40:01.549
You got to take the attention
and make it all about you.

40:01.573 --> 40:02.593
We were having a good weekend.

40:02.617 --> 40:04.402
It was a simple fucking game.

40:04.445 --> 40:05.533
We were all having fun.

40:05.577 --> 40:06.902
Yeah, we were teasing
you a little bit.

40:06.926 --> 40:08.536
Big fucking deal.

40:10.277 --> 40:11.365
Fuck you, Phil.

40:13.411 --> 40:18.241
Great.

41:50.812 --> 41:53.598
Shit.

42:11.050 --> 42:12.050
Come on.

42:13.052 --> 42:13.792
Seriously?

42:13.835 --> 42:15.663
Fuck.

42:33.594 --> 42:36.858
Come on, c'mon
c'mon c'mon c'mon.

42:36.902 --> 42:37.902
Wait.

42:40.209 --> 42:41.209
There.

42:42.560 --> 42:43.561
There we go.

42:44.605 --> 42:46.607
C'mon, stay stay stay.

42:48.174 --> 42:49.610
Yes!

42:49.654 --> 42:54.615
Okay.

43:01.404 --> 43:03.624
What's up, y'all?

43:04.886 --> 43:06.603
I know it's been a while
since you've seen me,

43:06.627 --> 43:09.151
but I have been
stuck up here in Ojai

43:09.195 --> 43:13.721
for the last couple of
days with zero reception.

43:13.765 --> 43:18.770
Plus no cable, no
phone, no nothing.

43:19.814 --> 43:22.425
I realize now that I am
addicted to social media

43:23.601 --> 43:26.647
and so this is the
first and the last time

43:26.691 --> 43:30.172
that I will be coming
up into the boondocks.

43:30.216 --> 43:32.697
I mean unless of course
someone wants to invite me

43:32.740 --> 43:35.743
to a five-star vineyard
and then count me in.

43:38.790 --> 43:43.795
Anyways it's two a.m.
and I can't sleep,

43:45.144 --> 43:48.800
so I just thought I'd come
up here into the wilderness.

43:50.279 --> 43:51.279
See?

43:58.723 --> 43:59.787
Okay, you probably can't see

43:59.811 --> 44:02.727
because it's dark
as fuck out here.

44:02.770 --> 44:06.556
Anyways, I just wanted
to send you guys a video

44:06.600 --> 44:08.689
and see what's goin'
on in the real world.

44:09.821 --> 44:12.867
See you soon, bitches.

44:22.311 --> 44:23.835
What's up, y'all?

44:23.878 --> 44:27.012
It's about two a.m. right
now and I can't sleep,

44:27.055 --> 44:29.928
so I thought I would
just walk all the way

44:29.971 --> 44:31.886
out here into the wilderness.

44:31.930 --> 44:32.931
See?

44:36.804 --> 44:39.981
What the fuck?

45:04.832 --> 45:09.837
Hey guys, did you see that
shit or am I goin' crazy?

45:12.666 --> 45:15.756
Maybe it's just cabin fever.

45:19.238 --> 45:20.761
I got to get the fuck outta here.

46:36.532 --> 46:38.099
He's coming.

47:28.106 --> 47:29.324
Ow.

47:29.368 --> 47:31.109
Oh my god, what are
you doin' in here?

47:31.152 --> 47:34.634
I heard loud screaming and
I wanted to check on you.

47:34.677 --> 47:35.677
Screaming?

47:36.810 --> 47:37.810
I was screaming?

47:40.727 --> 47:41.946
I had another nightmare.

47:43.469 --> 47:45.819
Something's not right, Grace.

47:45.863 --> 47:46.602
What?

47:46.646 --> 47:47.865
What do you mean?

47:47.908 --> 47:49.257
What was your dream about?

47:50.171 --> 47:52.913
Someone was killed.

47:56.264 --> 47:57.264
It was awful.

47:58.963 --> 48:00.486
I'm so sorry.

48:00.529 --> 48:01.942
Do you want me to
stay in here with you?

48:01.966 --> 48:03.750
Please, please.

48:04.664 --> 48:06.100
I can't stay here alone.

48:27.121 --> 48:30.733
It's okay, just close your eyes.

48:30.777 --> 48:31.777
It'll be okay.

49:21.088 --> 49:23.699
Good morning. Hey, Leah.

49:23.743 --> 49:25.005
Morning.

49:25.049 --> 49:25.963
I see you finally
got some sleep.

49:26.006 --> 49:28.052
Oh yeah, finally.

49:28.095 --> 49:30.141
Well, coffee's hot.

49:30.184 --> 49:32.578
I just made a fresh pot since
you all missed the first one

49:32.621 --> 49:34.188
I made at eight a.m.

49:34.232 --> 49:37.539
I can't tell you the
last time I slept this late.

49:39.063 --> 49:40.954
Well I'm just glad you were
able to go back to sleep.

49:40.978 --> 49:42.153
I was worried about you.

49:42.196 --> 49:42.980
Grace told me.

49:43.023 --> 49:44.024
You had a nightmare?

49:44.068 --> 49:45.721
Yeah it was so strange,

49:45.765 --> 49:48.159
but I was able to sleep like
a baby after you walked in.

49:49.725 --> 49:51.423
What's up, guys?

49:51.466 --> 49:52.250
Morning. Yo.

49:52.293 --> 49:53.947
Hey, Phil.

49:53.991 --> 49:54.730
Here, take this one.

49:54.774 --> 49:56.210
Oh, thanks.

49:56.254 --> 49:57.777
I didn't cook this morning,

49:57.820 --> 49:59.407
but there's bagels and
cream cheese in the fridge.

49:59.431 --> 50:00.431
Cool.

50:03.174 --> 50:04.218
Where's Dominic?

50:07.265 --> 50:09.136
We haven't seen
him this morning.

50:09.180 --> 50:10.355
We thought he was with you.

50:10.398 --> 50:11.660
No.

50:11.704 --> 50:14.054
When I woke up this
morning, he was gone.

50:14.098 --> 50:15.186
That's weird.

50:17.057 --> 50:18.450
I've been up since about 7:30

50:18.493 --> 50:20.669
and I haven't seen him
at all this morning.

50:22.062 --> 50:23.062
Whatever.

50:24.064 --> 50:26.153
He probably just
wants me to worry.

50:26.197 --> 50:28.242
We got into a fight last night.

50:28.286 --> 50:29.286
Really?

50:32.464 --> 50:33.813
We know, man.

50:33.856 --> 50:35.902
The hell were you
guys arguin' about?

50:35.945 --> 50:37.034
What, you heard us?

50:37.077 --> 50:39.079
Of course we did.

50:39.123 --> 50:39.993
I'm pretty sure the whole
fuckin' neighborhood heard y'all.

50:40.037 --> 50:41.037
Damn.

50:42.082 --> 50:43.605
It was stupid.

50:43.649 --> 50:44.998
Nothing, really.

50:45.042 --> 50:46.869
But Dom gets so worked
up about these things;

50:46.913 --> 50:49.089
Maybe he went for a
walk or something.

50:49.133 --> 50:50.177
It's a pretty long walk.

50:50.221 --> 50:52.005
Are you sure he didn't leave?

50:52.049 --> 50:53.180
Is the car still here?

50:53.224 --> 50:54.399
Yeah, I already checked.

50:54.442 --> 50:57.054
The car's outside,
all his stuff is here.

50:58.185 --> 50:59.404
Trust me.

50:59.447 --> 51:01.232
Guys, he's just
looking for attention.

51:02.407 --> 51:04.670
He probably went
on the longest walk

51:04.713 --> 51:06.367
so that I could be
worried about him.

51:06.411 --> 51:09.109
I know him too well.

51:11.720 --> 51:14.201
Where could he possibly
go around here though?

51:18.684 --> 51:19.554
Yeah, man.

51:19.598 --> 51:21.426
Maybe we should go look for him.

51:21.469 --> 51:23.428
We should definitely
go look for him.

51:23.471 --> 51:25.038
No!

51:25.082 --> 51:27.127
I mean this is exactly
what he wants, attention.

51:27.171 --> 51:28.694
I'm not giving it to him.

51:28.737 --> 51:31.523
Maybe he took a
walk and got lost.

51:31.566 --> 51:33.220
You should be worried, Phil.

51:33.264 --> 51:34.482
I agree.

51:34.526 --> 51:35.744
And I'm sorry guys,

51:35.788 --> 51:37.529
but I don't have a good
feeling about this.

51:38.791 --> 51:41.010
Fine, I'll go look for him.

51:43.274 --> 51:44.927
Can I finish my coffee first?

51:45.972 --> 51:47.756
I'll come with you, bro.

51:47.800 --> 51:48.800
We'll all go.

51:49.584 --> 51:50.584
Wonderful.

51:54.328 --> 51:56.635
What'd you do, Dominic man.

52:07.863 --> 52:08.863
Dominic!

52:11.389 --> 52:12.389
Dominic!

52:14.218 --> 52:15.218
Dom!

52:17.003 --> 52:18.003
Dominic!

52:22.226 --> 52:23.357
What the fuck, man?

52:23.401 --> 52:24.856
I feel we walk at least
two miles already.

52:24.880 --> 52:27.274
Why can't we just get in
the car and drive around?

52:27.318 --> 52:28.928
Dominic!

52:28.971 --> 52:30.190
You're right, Leah.

52:30.234 --> 52:31.409
Let's just go get the car.

52:31.452 --> 52:33.715
And what, drive all
the way back into town?

52:33.759 --> 52:35.282
That's at least seven miles.

52:35.326 --> 52:36.675
What else do you suggest, Phil?

52:36.718 --> 52:38.590
I'm telling you if
he walked seven miles,

52:38.633 --> 52:40.244
he wouldn't come back.

52:40.287 --> 52:43.377
He's probably back in LA
laughing at us right now.

52:44.770 --> 52:46.530
But didn't you say he left
all his stuff in the house?

52:46.554 --> 52:47.947
Exactly.

52:47.990 --> 52:50.341
The only thing I didn't
see was his cellphone,

52:50.384 --> 52:53.561
which doesn't
surprise me one bit.

52:53.605 --> 52:54.910
And what about this morning,

52:54.954 --> 52:56.651
you didn't hear him
wake up or last night?

52:56.695 --> 52:57.957
You kiddin' me?

52:58.000 --> 52:59.440
Phil could sleep
through a hurricane.

53:00.220 --> 53:01.439
I'll tell you one thing,

53:01.482 --> 53:03.658
I'm gonna kick his
ass when I see him.

53:03.702 --> 53:05.312
This shit isn't funny anymore.

53:07.314 --> 53:10.099
Let's just walk down that
way and check here real quick.

53:12.450 --> 53:14.016
The fuck is he at, man?

53:14.974 --> 53:15.974
Dom!

53:19.500 --> 53:20.501
Excuse me!

53:22.808 --> 53:23.808
Excuse me.

53:27.247 --> 53:27.943
Hey.

53:27.987 --> 53:29.249
Sorry to disturb you,

53:29.293 --> 53:30.531
but we're lookin'
for our friend.

53:30.555 --> 53:32.731
Have you seen anyone
wandering around here?

53:32.774 --> 53:34.080
Is someone missin'?

53:34.123 --> 53:35.536
Yeah, we have a friend
who wasn't at our house.

53:35.560 --> 53:37.320
We thought maybe he took
a hike and got lost,

53:37.344 --> 53:39.303
but we haven't been
able to find him.

53:39.346 --> 53:42.262
Caucasian, 'bout six
feet tall, blond hair.

53:42.306 --> 53:43.611
Here here, this is him.

53:45.744 --> 53:48.268
Sorry man, I
haven't seen anyone.

53:48.312 --> 53:49.376
But I just started my shift

53:49.400 --> 53:50.725
and I'm gonna be
workin' late tonight,

53:50.749 --> 53:53.273
so I can give you a
call if I see anything.

53:53.317 --> 53:55.101
Yeah, unfortunately
our phone service

53:55.144 --> 53:56.320
doesn't work out here.

53:56.363 --> 53:57.451
Can I give you our address?

53:57.495 --> 53:58.844
In case you see him,

53:58.887 --> 53:59.995
maybe you could ride
him up to the house.

54:00.019 --> 54:01.019
Sure.

54:02.239 --> 54:04.371
Our address
is 1517 Springcrest Road.

54:05.894 --> 54:06.894
Got that?

54:08.419 --> 54:10.203
You guys bought that house?

54:10.247 --> 54:11.247
Yeah.

54:13.206 --> 54:14.686
Wow.

54:14.729 --> 54:17.689
Yeah, I drove by there last
night because I saw lights on.

54:17.732 --> 54:19.517
Oh, so that was
you in our driveway.

54:19.560 --> 54:21.649
Yeah, I came up
because I didn't know

54:21.693 --> 54:23.956
the house finally sold.

54:23.999 --> 54:26.088
I was shocked to
see people moved in.

54:27.351 --> 54:28.351
What do you mean by that?

54:29.657 --> 54:32.356
Well there've been a
lot of people and animals

54:32.399 --> 54:34.401
that went missing
here, so most people

54:34.445 --> 54:37.317
sold their homes and left town.

54:37.361 --> 54:38.666
Wait, really?

54:38.710 --> 54:40.189
So the town is deserted?

54:41.582 --> 54:45.020
Okay look, I'm not
gonna bullshit you guys.

54:45.064 --> 54:46.346
Did your realtor tell
you about the people

54:46.370 --> 54:47.588
that lived in that house?

54:47.632 --> 54:49.460
No, didn't have a realtor.

54:49.503 --> 54:50.915
Okay look, I've only
been working security

54:50.939 --> 54:53.551
for over a year, so
I don't have details.

54:53.594 --> 54:55.117
But a couple years ago,

54:55.161 --> 54:58.425
the people in that
house went missing.

54:58.469 --> 55:00.209
What?

55:00.253 --> 55:01.428
Were they ever found?

55:01.472 --> 55:03.604
Actually it was a
woman and her daughter

55:03.648 --> 55:06.390
and no, no one ever found them.

55:06.433 --> 55:09.610
Their blood was all over
the house, but no bodies.

55:09.654 --> 55:11.264
Wait wait, are you serious?

55:11.308 --> 55:12.439
As a heart attack.

55:13.745 --> 55:16.313
It's the same woman and
daughter from my dreams.

55:16.356 --> 55:18.334
I mean at first, they
thought it was her ex-husband,

55:18.358 --> 55:20.404
but his alibi panned out.

55:20.447 --> 55:21.622
This is fucked up.

55:21.666 --> 55:23.755
Look, you guys seem
like really cool people

55:23.798 --> 55:26.366
so I don't wanna
lie to you, okay?

55:26.410 --> 55:27.735
There's just been
way too many people

55:27.759 --> 55:29.369
that have gone
missing in this area;

55:29.413 --> 55:31.328
Dead animals and shit.

55:32.459 --> 55:33.547
That's why they hired me.

55:34.548 --> 55:35.723
Oh my god.

55:35.767 --> 55:37.856
Wait, so how many people
have gone missing?

55:39.510 --> 55:42.774
So far, think like 30 people.

55:42.817 --> 55:45.167
Oh my god, get
the fuck outta here.

55:45.211 --> 55:47.169
But it's been
happening for years.

55:47.213 --> 55:49.389
Well that's why everyone
moved outta the neighborhood,

55:49.433 --> 55:50.671
especially because
they can't find one

55:50.695 --> 55:52.392
of those children
from that cult.

55:53.393 --> 55:56.222
Danny, somethin'?

55:56.265 --> 55:57.265
I can't remember.

55:58.485 --> 56:00.400
A kid in a cult?

56:00.444 --> 56:04.448
Yeah, there was a big
cult here back in the day

56:04.491 --> 56:08.365
doin' crazy stuff, then
they did a sting operation.

56:08.408 --> 56:09.603
But by the time they
caught up to them,

56:09.627 --> 56:12.107
every single member
had committed suicide

56:12.151 --> 56:14.196
besides one of the
children, Danny.

56:14.240 --> 56:16.808
He got away and no one
has ever found him.

56:22.291 --> 56:23.965
Come on, you guys seriously
don't know any of this?

56:23.989 --> 56:25.251
Hell no, man.

56:25.294 --> 56:26.513
We're from LA!

56:26.557 --> 56:28.602
I knew there was
somethin' wrong here.

56:28.646 --> 56:29.908
I'm sorry, guys.

56:29.951 --> 56:31.997
I just thought you guys
should know what's up.

56:32.040 --> 56:33.540
Look, I wasn't even
gonna take this job

56:33.564 --> 56:35.087
because all this stuff.

56:35.130 --> 56:39.091
But you know, I just had a
baby girl and I need the money.

56:40.353 --> 56:43.225
One thing for sure, I
don't get outta this car

56:43.269 --> 56:44.488
if I don't have to.

56:47.142 --> 56:50.276
You guys should take care
of yourselves out there.

56:50.319 --> 56:52.713
We won't be living
here after all,

56:52.757 --> 56:54.149
so don't worry about us.

56:56.238 --> 56:59.851
Look, I'll my eyes
open for your friend.

57:01.026 --> 57:04.421
If I see him, I'll
drive him to your place.

57:04.464 --> 57:05.464
Thank you.

57:06.597 --> 57:07.641
Of course.

57:09.730 --> 57:10.730
Good luck.

57:26.138 --> 57:27.507
I can't believe you
didn't look into the history

57:27.531 --> 57:29.228
of the house before
you bought it, Marcus.

57:29.271 --> 57:30.229
I did.

57:30.272 --> 57:31.752
I Googled it and saw nothing.

57:31.796 --> 57:33.841
Aren't they supposed
to tell you that by law?

57:33.885 --> 57:35.495
They didn't mention it, bro.

57:35.539 --> 57:38.629
Okay you guys, I'm really
worried about Dominic now.

57:38.672 --> 57:39.934
Yeah.

57:39.978 --> 57:41.129
I think we should just
pack our stuff and go.

57:41.153 --> 57:42.676
And what if he comes
back to the house

57:42.720 --> 57:44.243
and we're not there?

57:44.286 --> 57:46.724
I'm not leaving him
stranded out here.

57:46.767 --> 57:48.856
Look, let's just
go back to the house.

57:48.900 --> 57:49.640
Maybe he's there.

57:49.683 --> 57:51.250
And what if he's not?

57:51.293 --> 57:53.905
I'm not spending one
more night in that house.

57:53.948 --> 57:55.428
I wanna leave ASAP.

57:55.472 --> 57:56.666
Yeah I agree, I'm ready to go.

57:56.690 --> 57:58.736
You guys, we cannot
leave him out here.

57:58.779 --> 58:00.389
I'm not doing that.

58:00.433 --> 58:03.523
Look there's only a few
hours of daylight, man.

58:03.567 --> 58:04.785
We'll go back to the house.

58:04.829 --> 58:06.091
We'll pack our stuff up.

58:06.134 --> 58:07.614
If he's not there
before we leave,

58:07.658 --> 58:09.311
then we'll go see the police.

58:09.355 --> 58:10.355
Is that cool?

58:12.140 --> 58:13.140
'Kay.

58:14.403 --> 58:15.579
All right, let's go.

58:15.622 --> 58:17.182
I don't wanna be here
when it gets dark.

58:18.190 --> 58:19.190
Fuck!

58:41.735 --> 58:43.432
All right, bags are
packed and ready to go.

58:43.476 --> 58:44.521
Great, this is ready.

58:44.564 --> 58:45.652
We can eat then go.

58:47.262 --> 58:48.829
I'm not hungry at all, Grace.

58:50.527 --> 58:52.006
I just wanna find Dom.

58:52.050 --> 58:54.879
You said you wanted to wait
a while in case he came back.

58:54.922 --> 58:56.837
I know, but it's dark already

58:56.881 --> 59:00.014
and now I definitely think
we should go to the police.

59:00.058 --> 59:01.320
Fine.

59:01.363 --> 59:02.843
Lemme take this
out and clean up.

59:02.887 --> 59:03.757
I'm gonna just drive my car
down to the street real quick

59:03.801 --> 59:06.151
and see if I can get reception.

59:06.194 --> 59:07.718
Maybe this time he'll answer.

59:08.632 --> 59:12.026
All right,.

01:00:26.753 --> 01:00:28.146
Finally, a signal.

01:00:29.974 --> 01:00:33.325
Jesus Christ.

01:00:39.679 --> 01:00:41.768
What's up, y'all?

01:00:41.812 --> 01:00:44.162
Dom, where the fuck are you?

01:00:44.205 --> 01:00:46.033
We've been lookin'
for you for hours.

01:00:46.077 --> 01:00:47.165
This shit isn't funny!

01:00:50.821 --> 01:00:51.821
I hope you're okay.

01:00:53.693 --> 01:00:54.999
Just call me back
and let me know

01:00:55.042 --> 01:00:58.132
that you're okay so I can
stop worrying.

01:01:14.888 --> 01:01:15.888
What's up, y'all?

01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:19.545
I know it's been a while
since you've seen me,

01:01:19.588 --> 01:01:21.939
but I have been
stuck up here in Ojai

01:01:22.983 --> 01:01:24.245
for the last couple days.

01:01:24.289 --> 01:01:25.333
This motherfucker.

01:01:28.772 --> 01:01:32.732
Dominic, what the fuck?

01:01:32.776 --> 01:01:37.911
Dom, Dominic!

01:01:37.955 --> 01:01:39.696
Dom!

01:01:39.739 --> 01:01:44.701
What the hell, Dom?

01:01:47.878 --> 01:01:48.878
Dom!

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:52.970
Dominic, Dom!

01:01:56.756 --> 01:01:58.149
Dom, what the hell?

01:02:11.815 --> 01:02:13.599
Dom, what are you doing in here?

01:02:18.517 --> 01:02:23.522
Dominic!

01:02:55.336 --> 01:02:57.774
All right, we are all done.

01:02:57.817 --> 01:02:59.036
We can get outta here.

01:02:59.079 --> 01:03:00.230
What's taking your boy so long?

01:03:00.254 --> 01:03:01.821
I don't know.

01:03:01.865 --> 01:03:04.171
Let's just finish loadin'
the car and drive down there.

01:03:12.005 --> 01:03:13.180
This is bullshit.

01:03:13.224 --> 01:03:14.984
Make sure you guys bring
everything you need.

01:03:22.363 --> 01:03:24.539
The fuck?!

01:03:24.583 --> 01:03:25.845
Go, get inside!

01:03:30.197 --> 01:03:31.982
What the fuck is that?

01:03:32.025 --> 01:03:35.942
Call the police, Marcus.

01:03:35.986 --> 01:03:37.117
Shit!

01:03:37.161 --> 01:03:38.441
I don't have
reception, remember?

01:03:38.466 --> 01:03:40.817
What happened to Phillip?

01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:44.429
Should've just run
straight to the car.

01:03:44.472 --> 01:03:46.474
Can't believe this shit.

01:03:47.954 --> 01:03:50.957
What are we gonna do?

01:03:57.224 --> 01:03:57.964
We got to get outta here!
No, no, no, no.

01:03:58.008 --> 01:03:59.487
Somebody's out there!

01:04:10.281 --> 01:04:12.022
Yeah it looks
like a deserted car,

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:14.435
but it's in the
middle of the road

01:04:14.459 --> 01:04:16.983
in front of the
Springcrest residence.

01:04:17.027 --> 01:04:18.767
Go find out if it's their car.

01:04:18.811 --> 01:04:21.161
If not, tell them we're
gonna have to report it

01:04:21.205 --> 01:04:22.815
if it's in the
middle of the road.

01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:24.904
Man, you know I don't
mess with that house.

01:04:24.948 --> 01:04:25.949
It's Rashad.

01:04:27.994 --> 01:04:29.232
We have to make a
run for it, you guys.

01:04:29.256 --> 01:04:31.345
It's our only hope of
gettin' out of here.

01:04:31.389 --> 01:04:32.259
I don't know.

01:04:32.303 --> 01:04:33.367
How do we know that's Rashad?

01:04:33.391 --> 01:04:34.914
Are you kiddin' me?

01:04:34.958 --> 01:04:36.916
He told us earlier
that he'd be on patrol.

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.963
We have to go now
before he leaves.

01:04:40.006 --> 01:04:41.462
All right, let's just
leave it here tonight.

01:04:41.486 --> 01:04:44.924
If it's still here in the
morning, we'll tow it then.

01:04:44.968 --> 01:04:45.751
Come on, man.

01:04:45.794 --> 01:04:46.926
Are you serious?

01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:49.015
You're really scared
of that house?

01:04:49.059 --> 01:04:51.931
Yeah, I ain't goin' up there.

01:04:51.975 --> 01:04:54.586
It's dark as hell right now too.

01:04:54.629 --> 01:04:56.718
Rashad, this is your job.

01:04:56.762 --> 01:04:58.938
This is what you get paid to do.

01:04:58.982 --> 01:05:02.811
I suggest you do it if
you wanna stay employed.

01:05:03.943 --> 01:05:05.510
Copy that.

01:05:05.553 --> 01:05:07.033
I'm goin' now.

01:05:13.039 --> 01:05:14.171
Man, hell no!

01:05:19.611 --> 01:05:20.873
That's a long run, Grace.

01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:22.744
I don't know if
we could make it.

01:05:22.788 --> 01:05:24.137
You know what, Marcus?

01:05:24.181 --> 01:05:26.487
I'm no longer listenin' to
the shit you have to say.

01:05:26.531 --> 01:05:28.204
You're the reason why
we're even in this mess

01:05:28.228 --> 01:05:29.621
and every time I
follow your lead,

01:05:29.664 --> 01:05:31.057
you take us to some bullshit.

01:05:31.101 --> 01:05:31.971
I'm tryin' to keep you safe.

01:05:32.015 --> 01:05:32.972
Listen to me!

01:05:33.016 --> 01:05:34.582
No, I'm not doing
anything you say

01:05:34.626 --> 01:05:36.976
because you fuck everything up.

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:39.259
I'm gonna run to Rashad and
have him take me to the police.

01:05:39.283 --> 01:05:41.807
You guys can stay
here if you want.

01:05:46.333 --> 01:05:47.333
Fuck!

01:05:52.687 --> 01:05:55.864
Grace, no!
Leah wait, I'll bring her back!

01:06:11.054 --> 01:06:12.055
Rashad!

01:06:27.853 --> 01:06:28.853
Rashad!

01:06:31.117 --> 01:06:33.293
Rashad, you got to
take us to the police!

01:06:42.128 --> 01:06:43.128
Grace!

01:07:23.213 --> 01:07:24.518
Leah.

01:07:26.129 --> 01:07:27.956
Leah, open the door!

01:07:29.436 --> 01:07:31.264
Leah, open the door!

01:07:36.704 --> 01:07:39.142
Leah, please!

01:07:39.185 --> 01:07:40.185
Open the door!

01:07:42.188 --> 01:07:43.102
Leah, Leah.

01:07:43.146 --> 01:07:45.061
Not here. Open the door!

01:07:46.627 --> 01:07:47.237
Leah.

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:48.629
What the fuck, Leah?

01:07:48.673 --> 01:07:49.891
Open the door!

01:07:51.719 --> 01:07:53.852
Leah, open the door!

01:07:53.895 --> 01:07:55.027
Fuck, Leah!

01:07:55.071 --> 01:07:56.507
Open the door!

01:08:01.903 --> 01:08:03.253
Come on, Leah.

01:08:03.296 --> 01:08:04.819
Help with this table.

01:08:04.863 --> 01:08:05.907
Fuck.

01:08:07.039 --> 01:08:10.042
Get the fuck outta here!

01:08:13.698 --> 01:08:15.178
What was that?

01:08:15.221 --> 01:08:16.372
We got to get the
fuck outta here or we gonna die.

01:08:16.395 --> 01:08:17.136
Where's Grace?

01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:18.224
She's dead, Leah.

01:08:19.529 --> 01:08:21.314
Motherfucker killed her.

01:08:21.358 --> 01:08:22.140
What do you mean?

01:08:22.185 --> 01:08:23.055
What happened out there?

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:24.317
He killed Grace.

01:08:24.361 --> 01:08:25.536
He killed Phil.

01:08:25.578 --> 01:08:26.754
He killed everyone. No.

01:08:26.798 --> 01:08:28.669
We got to figure somethin' out.

01:08:28.712 --> 01:08:30.758
No no no. If he comes in here,

01:08:30.801 --> 01:08:32.108
we have to fight his ass.

01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:32.934
What?

01:08:32.978 --> 01:08:33.978
No, no!

01:08:34.849 --> 01:08:36.895
Fuck, get over here!

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:16.760
Fucker!
