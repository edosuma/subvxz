00:02.170 --> 00:03.023
Previously on
Pretty Little Liars...

00:03.730 --> 00:04.924
Eddie Lamb
gave this to Ezra.

00:04.970 --> 00:07.393
It's a drawing of my mother.
ARIA: He left it anonymously.

00:07.440 --> 00:09.533
Eddie wants Ezra to know
that there's something
to look into at Radley.

00:10.540 --> 00:11.632
RHONDA: Thief.

00:11.670 --> 00:13.376
Thief.

00:13.410 --> 00:15.776
The reason Zac_k
kept calling last night,

00:15.810 --> 00:18.108
he wanted to_ know
your reaction.

00:18.150 --> 00:19.549
He proposed?

00:19.580 --> 00:20.569
Cheers.

00:23.720 --> 00:26.109
Hanna, right?
It's Sydney, Emily's friend.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.252
You on your way out?

00:27.290 --> 00:28.780
No, Ijust had dinner
over at Em's.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.378
Do you want to sit
for a minute?

00:30.430 --> 00:32.796
I guess I probably could
sober up a little bit.

00:32.830 --> 00:34.650
You don't have to worry about
Shana, she's dead.

00:34.700 --> 00:35.689
I killed her.

00:38.470 --> 00:40.290
What did I miss?

00:40.340 --> 00:41.796
Did you just get the text
that came in? It's from "A".

00:41.840 --> 00:43.432
"New York, New York,
it's hell of a town.

00:43.470 --> 00:45.131
Ali's keeping secrets.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.309
Maybe that's because of
Hanna's big mouth."

00:49.710 --> 00:55.671
* What child is this,
who laid to rest on *

00:55.720 --> 01:01.158
* Mary's lap,
is sleeping *

01:01.190 --> 01:06.753
* Whom angels
greet with anthem sweet *

01:06.800 --> 01:12.761
* While shepherds watch
are keeping *

01:12.800 --> 01:16.201
* This, this is...

01:16.240 --> 01:18.299
So you hadn't spoken
to Shana

01:18.340 --> 01:20.706
since before the abduction?

01:20.740 --> 01:22.503
I hadn't spoken
to anyone during--

01:22.550 --> 01:25.178
No, I get it.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.848
Not until you broke free.

01:26.880 --> 01:29.485
I'm just trying to understand
why Shana,

01:29.520 --> 01:31.317
who thought you were
deceased,

01:31.350 --> 01:34.478
chose to move up to this area
and live with her aunt.

01:36.760 --> 01:38.625
I can't answer that.

01:38.660 --> 01:40.855
Well, neither can Shana,

01:40.900 --> 01:42.265
who really is deceased.

01:43.630 --> 01:45.860
So you will have to bear with me
while I wrap

01:45.900 --> 01:48.391
my brain around
the coincidence.

01:48.440 --> 01:50.761
Did you ever try
to contact Shana?

01:52.910 --> 01:55.504
I thought this was going
to be about my mother.

01:57.250 --> 01:59.218
Am I the only one
who thinks that this freak

01:59.250 --> 02:01.616
went after her _
because I got away from hIm?

02:01.650 --> 02:03.117
( bell rings )

02:04.390 --> 02:06.381
The police have
many theories.

02:16.270 --> 02:17.419
Why would Tanner
do this in here?

02:17.470 --> 02:19.631
To make a point.
We're next.

02:19.670 --> 02:22.639
Maybe the cops saw Ali
sneaking out of her house
last night, too.

02:22.670 --> 02:24.365
You didn't tell All about
Spencer's tapes, did you?

02:24.410 --> 02:25.763
Of course not.

02:25.810 --> 02:27.129
Some of us know how to keep
our mouths shut.

02:29.950 --> 02:31.303
Hey, what was
that about?

02:31.350 --> 02:33.773
Shana.
It was all about Shana.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.776
Does Tanner know _
we weren't In Philly that night?

02:35.820 --> 02:37.310
I can't tell.

02:37.350 --> 02:39.659
But she clearly
doesn't believe my story.

02:39.690 --> 02:41.385
She's trying
to trip me up.

02:41.420 --> 02:42.785
Okay,
well, I got to go call Ezra.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.525
No, Aria, wait.
For what?

02:44.560 --> 02:46.528
So she can go ambush him
while he's having

02:46.560 --> 02:48.255
a medical check-up
in New York?

02:48.300 --> 02:50.165
He needs to know what was
broadcast in the Brew.

02:53.900 --> 02:54.889
What's wrong?

02:55.970 --> 02:57.164
When did this happen?

02:58.570 --> 03:00.401
Did you have your bag
with you all morning?

03:00.440 --> 03:02.476
Yeah.

03:02.510 --> 03:03.499
What're you looking at?

03:08.020 --> 03:09.544
I don't get it.

03:09.590 --> 03:10.841
Somebody's circled
all the "A's".

03:14.590 --> 03:16.182
What?
Is there something else?

03:17.630 --> 03:19.689
"Glad _to hear
you sunglng.

03:19.730 --> 03:21.459
Last time you were
all choked up."

03:28.740 --> 03:31.300
* Got a secret,
can you keep it? *

03:31.340 --> 03:33.831
* Swear this one
you'll save *

03:33.880 --> 03:36.303
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

03:36.350 --> 03:38.739
* Taking this one
to the grave *

03:38.780 --> 03:40.975
* If I show you
then I know *

03:41.020 --> 03:43.909
* You won't tell
what I said *

03:43.950 --> 03:46.350
* 'Cause two can
keep a secret *

03:46.390 --> 03:48.608
* If one of them
is dead *

03:55.030 --> 03:56.861
EMILY:
It's not an outrageous theory.

03:56.900 --> 03:58.367
Mona may have recruited
half the school

03:58.400 --> 03:59.731
to torture Alison.

03:59.770 --> 04:01.260
It's not just Alison.

04:01.300 --> 04:02.938
We're all hearing
from "A" again.

04:02.970 --> 04:04.335
We still have no idea
who was in the Brew

04:04.370 --> 04:05.507
with Hanna and Sydney.

04:05.540 --> 04:06.768
Maybe
Sydney can tell us.

04:08.680 --> 04:10.341
Are you collecting
that for recycling?

04:10.380 --> 04:11.904
Hanna,

04:11.950 --> 04:13.042
what is
going on with you?

04:13.080 --> 04:14.616
What are you
talking about?

04:14.650 --> 04:15.947
Yesterday your blouse
was on inside out

04:15.980 --> 04:17.481
and today your locker
smells like Oktoberfest.

04:17.520 --> 04:18.646
What are you,
the hall monitor?

04:18.690 --> 04:19.884
No, we're your friends.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.410
And we're a little bit
concerned.

04:21.460 --> 04:22.882
You know what,
this can isn't even mine.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.421
Caleb probably
put it in my bag.

04:25.460 --> 04:27.826
Don't. I already have
one friend throwing me shade.

04:27.860 --> 04:29.498
Have you
apologized to her?

04:29.530 --> 04:31.669
Aria doesn't want
to hear it.

04:31.700 --> 04:33.361
I left her a message.
Yeah, we heard it.

04:33.400 --> 04:34.662
And it sounded like
you were underwater

04:34.700 --> 04:36.634
and Caleb was laughing
in the background.

04:36.670 --> 04:39.377
He was watching a guy eat
his own beard on YouTube.

04:39.410 --> 04:41.776
Classy.
You may need to say it again.

04:41.810 --> 04:43.675
Yeah, and apologize to Alison.

04:43.710 --> 04:45.905
Hanna, you almost outed
her in front of my mom.

04:45.950 --> 04:47.645
Okay, we were there
to support her story,

04:47.680 --> 04:48.840
not throw peanuts
at the stage.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.313
( bell rings )

04:50.350 --> 04:51.942
Let's just finish
this at lunch.

04:51.990 --> 04:53.309
I have other plans.

04:54.820 --> 04:56.583
Ali got grilled
by Tanner.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.780
"A" must have tipped her
off about New York.

04:58.830 --> 05:00.593
Has Eddie called yet?

05:00.630 --> 05:02.097
We need to figure out
what's up with those drawings.

05:02.130 --> 05:04.064
I've got to get them
back to Big Rhonda

05:04.100 --> 05:05.658
before she notices
they're missmg.

05:05.700 --> 05:08.396
Ezra, just call me
as soon as you can, okay?

05:09.970 --> 05:11.528
Hey, what are you--
what are you doing here?

05:11.570 --> 05:13.538
I was just dropping off
some invitations.

05:13.580 --> 05:14.831
What are you doing outside?

05:14.880 --> 05:17.075
Oh, um...

05:17.110 --> 05:18.839
I just had
to leave a message for Dad.

05:18.880 --> 05:20.711
I think I left a book
In hIs car.

05:20.750 --> 05:23.548
You were out the door
so fast thIs mornIng.

05:23.590 --> 05:26.411
I thought maybe we could
have breakfast together.

05:26.460 --> 05:27.688
Yeah, I just figured

05:27.720 --> 05:29.312
you guys were
a little jet-lagged.

05:30.590 --> 05:32.820
So look, I know
we've asked you to say

05:32.860 --> 05:34.122
a little something
Saturday night.

05:34.160 --> 05:36.822
Oh, Mom, no.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.430
_ I don't have to. It's--
It's your engagement party.

05:39.470 --> 05:42.860
No, honey, no, I want you to.
Um, it's just--

05:44.740 --> 05:46.833
I was wondering
ifI could introduce you

05:46.880 --> 05:48.905
as my maid of honor.

05:50.910 --> 05:53.447
Oh, my God, of course!

05:53.480 --> 05:54.970
Yes, of course.

05:55.020 --> 05:56.715
I'm so glad
you said that.

05:56.750 --> 05:58.581
So I booked us
an appointment today

05:58.620 --> 05:59.985
this afternoon
at the bridal shop. 50--

06:00.020 --> 06:01.556
Wait.
Today?

06:03.030 --> 06:06.022
No-- no, I can't today.
I'm at Radley.

06:06.060 --> 06:09.461
Oh, well, uh, can another
volunteer cover your shift?

06:09.500 --> 06:12.162
"Cause it's just a little triclq
to get these appointments,

06:12.200 --> 06:13.167
'cause they book a suite
and they do a tea service--

06:13.200 --> 06:14.758
Sounds like fun, Mom,

06:14.800 --> 06:16.165
but I'm gonna run
ahead to class.

06:16.200 --> 06:17.462
Can we figure this
out later?

06:17.510 --> 06:18.499
Sure.

06:25.980 --> 06:27.072
Sydney.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.076
Hey, were you
watching practice?

06:29.120 --> 06:31.486
No, I got hung up
in Language Lab.

06:31.520 --> 06:33.488
Damn.
I beat my freestyle record,

06:33.520 --> 06:34.748
thanks to you.

06:34.790 --> 06:36.883
Actually,
I wanted to thank you,

06:36.930 --> 06:38.557
helping Hanna
sober up last night.

06:38.590 --> 06:40.899
I mean, I heard
she was totally out of it.

06:40.930 --> 06:43.194
She didn't
seem that bad.
Really?

06:43.230 --> 06:44.788
She's like Amish
when it comes to booze.

06:44.830 --> 06:46.195
Two sips
and she's blotto.

06:46.230 --> 06:48.095
Making stuff up,
telling people her

06:48.140 --> 06:49.801
grandfather
invented the paper clip.

06:49.840 --> 06:51.899
Did he?
Hanna's? No.

06:51.940 --> 06:53.498
But she called me
from home and started

06:53.540 --> 06:55.633
rambling about us
going back to New York.

06:55.680 --> 06:58.069
I mean, we've never even been
to New York together.

06:58.110 --> 06:59.714
Did she invite you, too?

06:59.750 --> 07:01.945
I don't think she ever
mentioned New York.

07:05.690 --> 07:06.918
Are you seriously
not gonna tell me

07:06.960 --> 07:08.086
the real reason
you came In here?

07:11.490 --> 07:12.798
Did they not make
the offer?

07:12.830 --> 07:14.593
What offer?

07:14.630 --> 07:18.088
Assistant Coach.
The team took a vote.

07:19.970 --> 07:21.130
Oh, my God.

07:21.170 --> 07:22.728
Either _ _
you're an amazmg lIar

07:22.770 --> 07:24.806
or I am a total idiot.

07:24.840 --> 07:26.000
Please say
you're thrilled.

07:26.040 --> 07:29.203
Um...
I don't know.

07:29.240 --> 07:32.812
I mean, I have so much
stuff going on...

07:32.850 --> 07:33.839
Oh. Okay.

07:35.650 --> 07:37.538
Sorry.

07:37.590 --> 07:39.114
I thought you'd want this,
my bad.

07:43.730 --> 07:44.685
( clears throat )

07:44.730 --> 07:45.822
CALEB: Hello?
Caleb?

07:45.860 --> 07:47.088
Oh, hey, baby.

07:47.130 --> 07:48.825
I thought we were
meeting for lunch.

07:48.860 --> 07:50.020
What time is it?

07:50.070 --> 07:52.026
Uh, half past
I'm hungry.

07:52.070 --> 07:54.038
Uh, sorry,
I must have overslept.

07:54.070 --> 07:55.697
Let me just throw
some clothes on.

07:55.740 --> 07:57.867
No, no worries.
I'll just see you later.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.742
Hey. Hydrate.

08:07.820 --> 08:08.809
Thanks.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.712
Look, I'm really sorry
about the other night

08:11.750 --> 08:12.785
at Emily's dinner.

08:12.820 --> 08:14.879
That was so not cool.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.626
Um, we're all stressed.

08:17.960 --> 08:19.188
But if there's something else

08:19.230 --> 08:20.299
and you're really
upset with me...

08:20.330 --> 08:21.922
No, we're good.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.161
So my dad's going
to Westport for a few days

08:26.200 --> 08:27.667
and he wants me
to go WIth hIm.

08:27.700 --> 08:29.531
Is "A" gonna
let that happen?

08:31.170 --> 08:33.001
Neven

08:33.040 --> 08:35.736
But I obviously can't stay
home alone, so.

08:35.780 --> 08:37.042
Can I crash
at your house?

08:39.180 --> 08:42.069
Um, I-- I'd have
to talk to my mom.

08:42.120 --> 08:43.917
She has a lot going
on right now.

08:45.350 --> 08:47.056
But I'll talk to her.

08:49.060 --> 08:50.789
_ SPENCER: _
It just gets more tWIsted.

08:52.260 --> 08:54.148
If Bethany
was the one who pushed

08:54.200 --> 08:55.792
your mom off the roof

08:55.830 --> 08:57.229
and Mrs. DiLaurentis
covered for it,

08:57.270 --> 08:58.897
then I don't understand
why she would

08:58.930 --> 09:02.036
draw these pictures of
Mrs. DiLaurentis getting

09:02.070 --> 09:04.300
skewered by a demon.

09:04.340 --> 09:05.659
And why would
she turn on her?

09:05.710 --> 09:08.076
And did "A" play
any part in it?

09:08.110 --> 09:10.044
Because right now the only
common denominator

09:10.080 --> 09:12.844
between Bethany
and Mrs. D is "A".

09:15.680 --> 09:16.942
I'm sorry.

09:19.090 --> 09:20.978
I know that you wanted
to put Radley behind you.

09:21.020 --> 09:24.922
I can't put this behind me
until it's over.

09:24.960 --> 09:25.949
And it's not.

09:27.760 --> 09:28.954
But it might be soon.

09:30.870 --> 09:32.838
Once I'm asking questions
from the inside.

09:34.170 --> 09:35.239
From the inside of what?

09:35.270 --> 09:37.067
Did both
your parents move out?

09:37.110 --> 09:40.079
No, my mom's just
not sitting down for meals.

09:40.110 --> 09:41.805
She's barely
even eating.

09:41.840 --> 09:45.105
Your parents are gonna
work through this, Spencer.

09:45.150 --> 09:46.742
They've got a lot of history
together.

09:46.780 --> 09:48.839
That's what's splitting them up.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.211
What did you mean
by the "inside"?

09:50.250 --> 09:52.616
The police department.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.981
I enrolled at the
Harrisburg Police Academy.

09:58.060 --> 09:59.823
No, you didn't.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.122
You wouldn't do that.

10:01.160 --> 10:02.969
Why would you do that
without telling me?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.127
Probably
because I anticipated this warm

10:05.170 --> 10:06.865
and encouraging
response.

10:08.300 --> 10:10.768
Toby, you can't just
become a policeman.

10:10.810 --> 10:13.278
Why not? I thought
the uniform was a turn-on.

10:13.310 --> 10:15.972
No, it's not.
Is this why you cut your hair?

10:16.010 --> 10:18.149
Well, you know,
since the uniform didn't work.

10:18.180 --> 10:21.638
People do not just up
and join a police academy.

10:21.680 --> 10:23.887
They do, when they're
tired of watching people

10:23.920 --> 10:25.285
they love feel unprotected.

10:25.320 --> 10:26.981
Oh, my God.

10:27.020 --> 10:29.011
What-- look,
the cops in this town

10:29.060 --> 10:30.322
are either
bungIIng or corrupt.

10:30.360 --> 10:31.987
Wouldn't it be
refreshing to have

10:32.030 --> 10:33.998
someone inside that building
who actually cares?

10:34.030 --> 10:37.158
Somebody who'll have access
to all those police records?

10:37.200 --> 10:38.997
And somebody who doesn't
think my house blew up

10:39.030 --> 10:40.634
because of a gas leak?

10:43.440 --> 10:44.907
So now who's gonna
cook this dinner

10:44.940 --> 10:46.202
I was invited over for?

10:46.240 --> 10:47.229
You or me?

10:58.120 --> 11:00.088
Can I help you?

11:00.120 --> 11:04.159
Oh. Yeah. Um, I'm--
I'm looking for Eddie Lamb.

11:04.190 --> 11:05.885
He works here.

11:05.930 --> 11:07.420
I was just helping out
with art therapy.

11:07.460 --> 11:09.428
I know why you're here.
But Eddie's not.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.018
Yesterday
was his last day.

11:11.070 --> 11:12.890
Oh.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.430
He didn't mention that.

11:14.470 --> 11:16.438
Did he get another job?

11:16.470 --> 11:17.767
I have no idea.

11:17.810 --> 11:18.902
Did he leave
a forwarding number?

11:18.940 --> 11:20.771
Anyway to contact him?

11:20.810 --> 11:23.176
Are you here to finger-paint
or speed-date the orderlies?

11:23.210 --> 11:24.802
I suggest
you stick to the day room.

11:57.980 --> 11:59.106
You looking for something?

12:07.460 --> 12:09.018
1--

12:09.060 --> 12:12.086
I couldn't find
you and I just wanted to

12:12.130 --> 12:14.098
take another peek
at your sketchbook

12:14.130 --> 12:15.995
and then just
put it right back.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.491
One of the nurses...

12:21.540 --> 12:23.861
they said that you stashed it
under your bed.

12:28.280 --> 12:29.838
I'm sorry, Rhonda.
Really.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.302
I_-- I never meant
to Invade your space.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.274
But I'm gonna go back
to the day room now.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.309
They're probably
looking for me.

12:38.420 --> 12:39.887
Iwnmma
I saw you here.

12:41.560 --> 12:42.879
Okay.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.488
But it might
cost you something.

12:46.030 --> 12:48.749
Like what?

12:50.500 --> 12:53.389
ALISON: There were so many days
I thought I wouldn't make it.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.897
But then I thought
of my family

12:55.940 --> 12:58.807
and that's what got me
through it.

12:58.840 --> 13:00.774
Picturing my house,
my family.

13:02.110 --> 13:03.543
Hey, sweetie.

13:03.580 --> 13:04.774
Oh. Hey, Han.

13:07.180 --> 13:10.149
Alison is going to stay
with us for a few days

13:10.190 --> 13:11.316
until her dad gets back.

13:13.520 --> 13:16.557
Ali, why don't you go upstairs
and try to get some rest, okay?

13:16.590 --> 13:18.888
Hanna and I can ﬁnish
making dinner.

13:18.930 --> 13:20.158
Are you sure?

13:20.200 --> 13:21.497
Absolutely.

13:21.530 --> 13:24.067
You should take
a nice hot bath.

13:25.070 --> 13:26.890
Here, you can use these.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.293
It'll help you relax.

13:28.340 --> 13:29.898
Wow.

13:29.940 --> 13:31.032
Thank you, Mrs. Marin.

13:31.070 --> 13:32.207
You're welcome.

13:38.950 --> 13:40.178
Hanna, can you wash
your hands and help?

13:40.220 --> 13:41.346
We're having stir fry.

13:46.490 --> 13:49.482
That was so upsetting.

13:51.090 --> 13:55.220
That girl
has no support system at all.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.320
You know I used to think Ali
was too tough for her own good.

13:59.370 --> 14:01.065
But, thank God.

14:01.100 --> 14:02.636
Thank God she is.

14:02.670 --> 14:05.002
Otherwise I don't think
she'd have survived.

14:06.910 --> 14:08.104
( sighs )

14:08.140 --> 14:09.607
After dinner,
could you please make up

14:09.640 --> 14:12.370
the day bed
with clean sheets?

14:12.410 --> 14:14.071
I'm actually not gonna
stay for dinner.

14:14.120 --> 14:17.089
I promised Caleb
that I'd help him study

14:17.120 --> 14:19.008
for his exit exams.

14:20.690 --> 14:23.227
Okay, well, could you
at least show Alison

14:23.260 --> 14:24.284
where the guest towels are?

14:24.330 --> 14:25.524
Fine.

14:28.660 --> 14:30.298
And by the way,
I've asked to use

14:30.330 --> 14:32.321
those bath salts,
like a million times.

14:39.210 --> 14:40.575
Do you want
a cup with that?

14:40.610 --> 14:43.443
Maybe some crushed ice.

14:45.210 --> 14:47.110
Why you so into
that sketchbook?

14:47.150 --> 14:48.174
Was she a friend of yours?

14:48.220 --> 14:49.312
Bethany?

14:49.350 --> 14:51.887
No, I-- I never met her.

14:53.320 --> 14:57.450
But her body was buried
in my friend's backyard.

14:57.490 --> 15:00.425
So I think everyone's just
a little curious about

15:00.460 --> 15:02.655
who she was,
why she ran away.

15:02.700 --> 15:05.589
Everybody thinks about
running away from here.

15:05.630 --> 15:08.133
A lot of folks had it
a whole lot worse than she did.

15:08.170 --> 15:09.330
How do you mean?

15:09.370 --> 15:11.008
I never had
nobody signing me out,

15:11.040 --> 15:12.200
taking me to the circus.

15:12.240 --> 15:14.003
Wait.
Who signed Bethany out?

15:14.040 --> 15:16.406
That rich lady with
the big beige purse.

15:16.440 --> 15:18.704
She gave Bethany
a whole lot more than

15:18.750 --> 15:19.705
a bag of chips.

15:19.750 --> 15:21.240
Wait. What rich lady?

15:22.750 --> 15:24.945
Was her name
Mrs. DiLaurentis?

15:26.350 --> 15:27.453
Something like that.

15:29.060 --> 15:30.925
What kind of gifts
was she giving her?

15:32.590 --> 15:34.319
Did she ever give her
any clothes?

15:34.360 --> 15:36.555
A yellow top, maybe?
It was layered and--

15:36.600 --> 15:38.420
I don't remember
anything about a top.

15:38.470 --> 15:40.495
But I sure as hell
remember Custard.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.064
She gave her a pie?

15:43.340 --> 15:45.160
A horse.

15:45.210 --> 15:47.098
She took her out to those
stables by Lewisburg

15:47.140 --> 15:50.075
and let Bethany
adopt her own damn pony.

15:50.110 --> 15:51.441
Do you know
why Mrs. DiLaurentis

15:51.480 --> 15:52.947
would have been giving
her all these gifts?

15:54.350 --> 15:57.649
Rhonda, that rich lady
was murdered recently.

15:57.690 --> 16:00.181
And her body was found
in the backyard next door

16:00.220 --> 16:01.710
to where Bethany's was buried.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.455
And there's a really
good chance

16:03.490 --> 16:05.583
that the same exact person
did this to both of them.

16:05.630 --> 16:08.326
Now do you have any idea
at all who this person might be?

16:08.360 --> 16:10.191
( door opens )

16:10.230 --> 16:12.198
What's going on in here?

16:12.230 --> 16:13.231
Where did you get that?

16:14.800 --> 16:16.734
Is this your idea of
"occupational therapy"?

16:16.770 --> 16:20.069
Giving a diabetic
soda pop?

16:20.110 --> 16:21.771
Get out of here.
Now.

16:25.650 --> 16:27.345
I can't even stand
to look at her

16:27.380 --> 16:30.543
and now she's in my pajamas,
drooling on my pillow.

16:32.520 --> 16:33.987
Please tell me you brought
food in that bag.

16:35.390 --> 16:37.221
I thought I was
supplying beverages.

16:37.260 --> 16:38.249
Whoa.

16:41.160 --> 16:43.094
Hey, do you want to
go on a trip together?

16:43.130 --> 16:45.223
You mean, further
than your cabin?

16:45.270 --> 16:46.567
Yeah, someplace far.

16:48.400 --> 16:50.129
You're not the only one
who needs to change it up.

16:51.410 --> 16:54.231
How do you feel about, um,
Japan?

16:54.280 --> 16:56.373
Mm-mm. I can't.

16:56.410 --> 16:58.401
The only sushi
I do is California rolls.

17:00.280 --> 17:01.440
Hmm... Myanmar?

17:04.720 --> 17:06.517
Okay, ifI can't spell it
or pronounce it,

17:06.550 --> 17:08.711
I can't go there.

17:08.760 --> 17:11.320
Hey, did you bring
anything to cut this with?

17:11.360 --> 17:13.021
I was just gonna wait
till we got back to my place.

17:14.230 --> 17:15.595
Do you want to stop and
get sodas?

17:15.630 --> 17:18.167
I need a sandwich.
I'm starVIng.

17:19.730 --> 17:21.459
You know, I'll be right back.
Do you want anything?

17:37.520 --> 17:38.748
Hanna?

17:38.790 --> 17:40.280
Can I help you?

17:40.320 --> 17:42.356
Or are you just
cooling off your face?

17:42.390 --> 17:44.688
I want a tuna melt.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.220
Sorry, I closed it up
early tonight

17:46.260 --> 17:47.227
to get ready for tomorrow.

17:47.260 --> 17:48.227
Aria's mom just left.

17:48.260 --> 17:49.796
Right.

17:53.470 --> 17:55.199
Do you want it to-go?

17:55.240 --> 17:58.232
( music playing )

18:15.490 --> 18:16.457
Knock, knock.

18:16.490 --> 18:18.253
Sydney?

18:18.290 --> 18:19.587
Hey.

18:19.630 --> 18:20.722
What's going on?

18:20.760 --> 18:22.091
Your mom said
I could interrupt.

18:23.630 --> 18:26.861
This was delivered
to my house and...

18:26.900 --> 18:29.232
well, I'm not really sure
what to do with it now.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.728
You ordered
this for me?

18:35.780 --> 18:38.101
Guess I should have waited
before I pulled the trigger.

18:39.510 --> 18:41.819
You won't take
no for an answer, WIll you?

18:41.850 --> 18:43.545
Maybe 'cause our
training sessions

18:43.590 --> 18:46.343
aren't happening anymore.
I just wanted to know

18:46.390 --> 18:47.379
you'd still be
in the bleachers.

18:48.920 --> 18:51.229
It kind of sucks
when you're the new kid

18:51.260 --> 18:52.784
on the team and no one's
cheerIng you on.

18:54.530 --> 18:56.498
My boyfriend used to,
but now he's in college.

18:56.530 --> 18:57.758
What about your parents?

18:57.800 --> 18:59.222
My mom's not into it.

18:59.270 --> 19:00.931
And my dad's
always traveling.

19:00.970 --> 19:03.234
He's opening
these frozen yogurt shops.

19:03.270 --> 19:04.669
They're all over the place.

19:04.710 --> 19:06.359
You probably saw one
when you were in New York.

19:06.410 --> 19:08.708
They're called--
Wait.

19:08.740 --> 19:10.276
When was I in New York?

19:11.980 --> 19:13.641
Didn't you say you
and your friends were...

19:13.680 --> 19:16.171
No, that was Hanna
and you said that

19:16.220 --> 19:17.847
she never mentioned--

19:17.890 --> 19:19.687
My brain is mush,
too much time underwater.

19:26.430 --> 19:27.556
ZACK:
Hey, you want mustard?

19:27.600 --> 19:29.795
Yes, please.

19:29.830 --> 19:31.161
Looks really nice in here.

19:32.300 --> 19:33.494
Glad you approve.

19:34.570 --> 19:37.209
Looks like a "quincinera."

19:38.310 --> 19:39.504
"Quin-ci-nera."

19:40.710 --> 19:42.268
You know
what I'm talking about.

19:42.310 --> 19:44.540
I do.

19:44.580 --> 19:46.946
Just a heads up.
I can smell you from here.

19:46.980 --> 19:48.208
What's that? Rum?

19:49.520 --> 19:50.589
Whiskey.

19:50.620 --> 19:52.417
Whiskey? Jeez.

19:52.450 --> 19:54.680
The rough stuff.

19:54.720 --> 19:55.516
Bad girl, huh?

19:57.260 --> 19:58.921
Always had a thing
for the bad girls.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.467
You know, this is the part
where I'm supposed

20:05.500 --> 20:06.819
to lecture you about drinking,

20:06.870 --> 20:09.395
but I'm willing to keep this
between us.

20:10.540 --> 20:12.599
I can keep a secret.
Can you?

20:14.910 --> 20:16.639
Did Aria make the flowers?

20:18.350 --> 20:19.908
Yeah.
They're great, right?

20:23.050 --> 20:24.312
All yours.

20:24.350 --> 20:25.487
Thank you.

20:25.520 --> 20:26.646
Oh, no, no, please.

20:26.690 --> 20:27.884
It's on me.

20:29.760 --> 20:30.784
Thanks.

20:39.930 --> 20:40.669
I'll never get back
into her room.

20:42.500 --> 20:43.467
SPENCER:
Did they fire you?

20:43.510 --> 20:44.738
No, I didn't kill her.

20:44.770 --> 20:46.465
I just gave her
a frigging root beer.

20:46.510 --> 20:48.478
How was I supposed to know
she needed sugar-free?

20:48.510 --> 20:49.909
What's the name
of the stables?

20:49.940 --> 20:51.749
I don't know,
but we can figure that out.

20:51.780 --> 20:53.645
How many stables
are near Lewisburg?

20:53.680 --> 20:56.342
Uh, Aria, it's called
"Horse Country" for a reason.

20:56.380 --> 20:57.813
( door opens )

20:57.850 --> 20:58.839
I got to go.

21:02.390 --> 21:03.482
I completely forgot.

21:03.530 --> 21:04.827
Where were you?

21:04.860 --> 21:06.623
I went through
a lot of trouble to change

21:06.660 --> 21:08.696
that appointment time
and then you just blew it off.

21:08.730 --> 21:10.027
What is wrong with you?

21:10.060 --> 21:11.698
I'm sorry.

21:11.730 --> 21:14.437
I-- I just have
a lot on my mind.
Really?

21:14.470 --> 21:15.937
Or is this some form of
passwe reSIstance?

21:15.970 --> 21:17.369
What?
I don't even know--

21:17.410 --> 21:18.763
Because if something
has changed

21:18.810 --> 21:20.437
since I first told you,
if you don't want me

21:20.480 --> 21:21.833
to get married again,
I need you to be

21:21.880 --> 21:23.848
open about it,
instead of acting out.

21:23.880 --> 21:25.347
No, that's not it at all.

21:26.680 --> 21:28.409
Mom, I'm really
happy for you.

21:28.450 --> 21:29.940
I just--

21:29.980 --> 21:32.346
I don't know,
honestly, I just forgot.

21:36.490 --> 21:39.050
Okay, I will try
and change the time.

21:39.090 --> 21:41.729
But if you miss it--
I won't.

21:41.760 --> 21:42.829
I promise.

22:00.450 --> 22:02.077
I think that you should
take me home.

22:02.120 --> 22:06.409
It's getting late and I don't
want my mom to worry.

22:06.450 --> 22:07.815
Hanna,
I can't drive right now.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.350
I can call you a cab
or something.

22:11.160 --> 22:12.684
What's wrong?

22:12.730 --> 22:15.699
Nothing.
It's just, my skirt.

22:15.730 --> 22:17.425
It's too short.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.461
No. It's not.

22:21.170 --> 22:22.467
It's perfect.

22:32.750 --> 22:34.115
Wait, wait, wait.

22:34.150 --> 22:35.742
Can you call them
in like a half an hour?

22:36.880 --> 22:38.017
I have to go.

22:39.750 --> 22:40.751
Is everything okay?

22:42.160 --> 22:46.449
Yeah, I'm just drunk
and I'm tired.

22:46.490 --> 22:47.889
And I want to go to sleep.

22:58.040 --> 22:59.359
Thanks, Emily.

23:03.510 --> 23:04.875
Hey.

23:04.910 --> 23:06.878
She wanted to know
why Hanna was absent.

23:06.910 --> 23:10.175
What'd you say?
I said, I don't know.
It's the truth.

23:10.220 --> 23:12.518
Maybe she's just
trying to avoid Aria.

23:12.550 --> 23:14.518
Avoiding
is not returning a call.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.050
Chasing down
your morning muffin

23:16.090 --> 23:18.024
with malt liquor,
that's something else.

23:18.060 --> 23:19.652
( cell phone buzzing )

23:19.690 --> 23:21.521
If she won't listen to us,
someone needs

23:21.560 --> 23:22.891
to talk to her, like Caleb.

23:22.930 --> 23:25.069
Aria found out
the name of the stables.

23:25.100 --> 23:26.761
Well,
let's go after school.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.893
What exactly
are we looking for?

23:28.940 --> 23:30.191
We always thought
that Mrs. D

23:30.240 --> 23:32.561
was protecting
whoever hit All out of love.

23:32.610 --> 23:34.669
What if it was out of fear?

23:34.710 --> 23:36.678
What if this person
had something on her?

23:36.710 --> 23:38.940
So now we're thinking
that Bethany hit Ali?

23:43.080 --> 23:44.684
Where have you been?

23:44.720 --> 23:46.085
I fell asleep
in Caleb's car.

23:47.890 --> 23:48.914
Where is everybody?

23:48.960 --> 23:50.518
Did class start yet?

23:50.560 --> 23:52.528
No, it's over.

23:52.560 --> 23:53.629
What's in your hair?

23:56.630 --> 23:58.962
It's a Krispie Treat.
Can you get it out please?

24:01.140 --> 24:03.062
Hanna,

24:03.100 --> 24:05.466
why are you napping
at 10 A.M.?

24:05.510 --> 24:06.807
Because
I couldn't sleep, okay?

24:06.840 --> 24:08.137
I have a new roommate
named AlIson.

24:08.180 --> 24:10.205
And there's other stuff,
too.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.470
Ow!
Emily don't pull so hard.

24:12.510 --> 24:14.944
Well, it's glued
to your scalp.

24:14.980 --> 24:16.117
What other stuff?

24:17.590 --> 24:19.808
Hanna, what other stuff?

24:19.850 --> 24:20.817
If "A" is targeting you--

24:20.860 --> 24:23.215
It's not "A", okay.

24:23.260 --> 24:26.582
I had a really weird moment
with your boss last night.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.895
My boss?

24:29.930 --> 24:31.761
Zack?
Yeah.

24:31.800 --> 24:33.563
I went to the Brew
to get a sandwich

24:33.600 --> 24:37.161
and he just got a little bit
too friendly. Okay?

24:37.200 --> 24:38.838
What are you
talking about?

24:38.870 --> 24:40.838
He put his hand on my back,
Emily,

24:40.880 --> 24:43.235
and it was there
for way too long.

24:43.280 --> 24:44.975
Are you sure that you're
not reading into this?

24:45.010 --> 24:46.841
No.

24:46.880 --> 24:49.110
I mean, were you buzzed?

24:49.150 --> 24:51.516
You know what,
forget I said anything.

24:51.550 --> 24:53.711
Hanna, wait.
No! The only reason I told you

24:53.760 --> 24:55.716
was because part of me
wants to say something to Aria.

24:55.760 --> 24:56.715
But if you two
don't believe me--

24:56.760 --> 24:58.250
That's not what we said.

24:58.290 --> 25:00.121
It's just that if you
misinterpreted this at all,

25:00.160 --> 25:01.855
you don't want to be
putting it out there

25:01.900 --> 25:03.720
two days before this
guy's engagement party.

25:03.770 --> 25:06.159
And once it's said,
you can't take it back.

25:07.800 --> 25:09.859
Yeah, you're right.

25:09.900 --> 25:11.003
See you guys later.

25:11.040 --> 25:12.268
Hey, Hanna.

25:12.310 --> 25:13.777
No, I have to go
to the bathroom.

25:15.680 --> 25:16.669
ASHLEY: Hanna,
are you in there?

25:16.710 --> 25:18.041
The school just called me.

25:19.650 --> 25:21.538
Alison?

25:21.580 --> 25:23.639
Is everything okay?
Where's Hanna?

25:25.820 --> 25:27.117
Caleb picked her up.

25:28.920 --> 25:30.080
Why aren't you at school?

25:32.990 --> 25:34.127
What happened?

25:38.070 --> 25:39.662
I heard someone
last night...

25:41.340 --> 25:43.228
outside the window,
trying to get in.

25:44.240 --> 25:45.559
I couldn't go to sleep.

25:45.610 --> 25:46.599
I just kept hearing things.

25:48.810 --> 25:51.540
And when I got up to go
to school this morning...

25:52.750 --> 25:53.944
I couldn't move.

25:56.350 --> 25:57.544
Alison...

26:00.860 --> 26:02.680
Did you sleep
in there last night?

26:05.730 --> 26:08.597
Okay, I'll call
the school.

26:10.900 --> 26:12.128
You try to get
some rest, okay?

26:37.220 --> 26:37.652
( horses neighing )

26:42.130 --> 26:43.392
Are you Declan?

26:43.430 --> 26:46.126
Hi. The lady inside said
you were the one

26:46.170 --> 26:47.159
to talk to for lessons.

26:48.870 --> 26:49.859
I don't work
with beginners.

26:51.170 --> 26:52.364
Uh, well, I'm not.

26:52.410 --> 26:53.877
I've had 8 years
of English.

26:55.010 --> 26:55.999
I teach Western.

26:57.340 --> 26:59.308
Well, um, we...

26:59.350 --> 27:01.318
we just heard that this place
was really great.

27:01.350 --> 27:03.113
Our neighbor
used to ride up here.

27:03.150 --> 27:04.139
Jessica DiLaurentis?

27:06.290 --> 27:07.985
She might not have
been up here for a while.

27:08.020 --> 27:09.317
But there was this horse,
Custard?

27:10.890 --> 27:12.152
You here
on some kind of dare?

27:12.190 --> 27:14.124
What?

27:14.160 --> 27:15.889
You look like
the only horse

27:15.930 --> 27:18.125
you've ever been around was
stuffed and in your crib.

27:18.170 --> 27:19.262
If you're that spooked around
Zarro--

27:19.300 --> 27:21.734
She's not spooked.

27:21.770 --> 27:22.737
Just shy.

27:22.770 --> 27:23.930
Okay.

27:25.770 --> 27:27.306
Come on, Zarro.
Come on.

27:32.450 --> 27:33.644
What are you?
Mute?

27:36.450 --> 27:37.917
( knocking on door)

27:39.790 --> 27:41.758
Hey.
Hi.

27:41.790 --> 27:45.180
So Hanna's having dinner
with Caleb again.

27:45.230 --> 27:47.425
Not really sure
what's going on with her.

27:47.460 --> 27:49.894
But I thought
the two of us could go out

27:49.930 --> 27:50.919
and grab a bite
to eat.

27:51.930 --> 27:53.898
I'm okay staying here.

27:53.940 --> 27:55.794
Honey, you've been
inside all day.

27:58.070 --> 27:59.059
I think
we need to go out.

28:00.810 --> 28:02.038
( thunder rumbling )

28:02.080 --> 28:03.331
Okay.

28:13.490 --> 28:14.684
Declan?

28:16.020 --> 28:18.329
Sorry, we're still here.
Just curious.

28:18.360 --> 28:20.794
Do you ever let people
adopt your horses?

28:20.830 --> 28:22.229
We've done it
a few tImes.

28:22.260 --> 28:24.125
Special cases.

28:24.170 --> 28:25.922
That lady
you're talking about,

28:25.970 --> 28:28.336
is she the one who came up here
with that strange girl?

28:28.370 --> 28:29.837
The one who wanted
to ride in her slippers?

28:29.870 --> 28:31.007
Bethany?

28:31.040 --> 28:32.200
I don't remember
names.

28:32.240 --> 28:33.468
But after the
bucket incident,

28:33.510 --> 28:34.807
I don't think
they ever came back.

28:34.840 --> 28:36.330
What--

28:36.380 --> 28:38.007
what happened
with the bucket?

28:38.050 --> 28:40.348
The lady wanted the girl
to call her Aunt Jessie.

28:40.380 --> 28:41.972
Girl has a meltdown,
throws a bucket at her.

28:42.020 --> 28:43.476
I knew
they weren't related.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.249
There was something else
going on.

28:45.290 --> 28:47.110
Was it always
just the two of them

28:47.150 --> 28:48.811
or was there ever
a thIrd person?

28:48.860 --> 28:50.111
Maybe
another blonde girl

28:50.160 --> 28:51.957
who called
Mrs. DiLaurentis "Mom"?

28:51.990 --> 28:53.025
A lot of people
come through here.

28:53.060 --> 28:54.049
I don't take attendance.

28:56.400 --> 28:58.220
before that storm
kIcks In.

28:58.270 --> 28:59.965
The roads up here,
they turn into soup.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.137
Thanks.

29:05.270 --> 29:07.238
Why would you ask if Alison
had come up here?

29:07.270 --> 29:08.908
She told us
she never met Bethany.

29:08.940 --> 29:10.373
Yeah, she told us
a lot of things.

29:10.410 --> 29:11.502
Where are you
going with this?

29:11.550 --> 29:12.505
I don't know.

29:12.550 --> 29:13.847
I just
thought it would be

29:13.880 --> 29:14.847
worth it to float
the question.

29:14.880 --> 29:16.108
( thunder rumbling )

29:16.150 --> 29:17.845
It's gonna start pouring.
Let's go.

29:17.890 --> 29:20.381
No, I just need to take
a look around here first.

29:20.420 --> 29:22.888
Spencer,
where are you going?

29:40.040 --> 29:41.302
( knocking on glass )

29:45.310 --> 29:49.076
Hey. Sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.543
Saw you out here,
thought we could talk.

29:51.590 --> 29:53.546
I was actually
just about to leave.

29:53.590 --> 29:55.114
What's your rush?
Finish your meal.

29:57.460 --> 29:59.553
I just wasn't sure
what your impression

29:59.590 --> 30:00.784
was of yesterday.

30:02.330 --> 30:06.027
Yeah,
sorry I was sort of off.

30:06.070 --> 30:07.298
Right.

30:07.330 --> 30:08.297
_ I wasn't sure_
If you were feeIIng

30:08.340 --> 30:09.796
the same vibe as me, but...

30:11.540 --> 30:12.564
I kind of think
you are.

30:12.610 --> 30:14.339
( thunder rumbling )

30:48.240 --> 30:49.832
There's two of us.

30:51.510 --> 30:55.014
Yes, and can we just
have a quieter table,

30:55.050 --> 30:57.348
maybe in the corner
or something?

30:57.380 --> 30:59.848
All right.
Thank you. Bye.

31:01.690 --> 31:03.112
( thunder rumbling )

31:19.610 --> 31:20.929
( banging on door)

31:22.010 --> 31:23.034
Hanna?

31:24.150 --> 31:25.105
Is that you, honey?

31:25.150 --> 31:28.074
( floorboard creaks )

31:31.220 --> 31:32.448
Hanna?

31:37.320 --> 31:38.628
( thunder rumbling )

31:40.230 --> 31:41.322
Alison?

31:41.360 --> 31:42.554
_I'll be _down
In a mInute.

32:02.580 --> 32:03.615
You know,
I'm actually not that hungry.

32:03.650 --> 32:04.639
Shh.

32:08.460 --> 32:09.449
Give me your phone.

32:37.280 --> 32:38.486
( dialing )

32:42.260 --> 32:43.215
WOMAN: ( on phone )
911.

32:48.100 --> 32:48.725
Anything distinctive
about it?

32:51.230 --> 32:52.299
The shadow.

32:54.270 --> 32:55.259
Mrs. Marin?

32:56.700 --> 32:58.463
It was a man.

32:58.510 --> 32:59.704
A man's shadow.

33:01.540 --> 33:03.770
Feel certain
that's what it was, Alison?

33:03.810 --> 33:06.347
Yes.

33:06.380 --> 33:08.245
Why do you feel certain
it was a man's shadow?

33:10.520 --> 33:13.114
Uh... because it was big.

33:14.260 --> 33:15.352
Loud.

33:15.390 --> 33:17.210
Loud?

33:17.260 --> 33:20.127
His weight
made the floorboards creak.

33:20.160 --> 33:21.354
I thought you weren't
aware of the intruder

33:21.400 --> 33:22.799
until you came
downstairs.

33:22.830 --> 33:25.219
By that time he would have been
in the kitchen.

33:25.270 --> 33:28.660
Are there floorboards
in the kitchen or is it tile?

33:28.700 --> 33:31.100
Floorboards. Why are you
questioning her like this?

33:31.140 --> 33:32.630
This is just standard
police procedure.

33:32.670 --> 33:34.638
Really? To treat the victim
like a criminal?

33:34.680 --> 33:38.104
I'm just gathering as much
detailed information as I can.

33:38.150 --> 33:40.368
Hasn't this girl been
through enough?

33:40.410 --> 33:43.641
There's a predator out there
and you have done nothing,

33:43.680 --> 33:45.511
nothing to make
anyone feel any safer!

33:45.550 --> 33:47.108
Mrs. Marin...

33:47.150 --> 33:48.515
I'm not talking to you
as a concerned citizen.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.414
I'm a mother,
whose daughter is also

33:50.460 --> 33:51.779
affected by
this situation.

33:51.830 --> 33:54.549
You need to catch
this psycho before--

34:02.700 --> 34:04.167
Before he strikes again.

34:16.180 --> 34:17.317
( knocking on door)

34:23.190 --> 34:24.350
Hi.

34:26.490 --> 34:27.479
Hey.

34:29.330 --> 34:30.752
Do you need a towel?

34:30.800 --> 34:32.324
No, I'm fine.

34:33.470 --> 34:34.732
Look, I know that
me and you

34:34.770 --> 34:36.465
aren't on the best terms
rIght now,

34:36.500 --> 34:41.779
but I had to come over
and I don't know

34:41.810 --> 34:44.199
how else to say this, so I guess
I'll just say it but--

34:45.610 --> 34:47.202
Zack hit on me.

34:48.480 --> 34:49.708
What?

34:49.750 --> 34:51.308
At first I thought
that he was joking,

34:51.350 --> 34:52.442
but then he got
into my car and--

34:52.490 --> 34:53.741
Wait.

34:53.790 --> 34:56.213
What--
what are you saying?

34:59.490 --> 35:00.627
He wanted
to hook up with me.

35:02.900 --> 35:03.855
You kissed him?

35:03.900 --> 35:05.458
No.

35:05.500 --> 35:06.467
No, I didn't.

35:06.500 --> 35:07.524
But he was
the one who...

35:07.570 --> 35:09.197
This is so messed up.

35:09.240 --> 35:10.730
Aria, I know.
That's why I wanted to tell you.

35:10.770 --> 35:12.260
No. You.

35:12.310 --> 35:13.459
You are the problem, Hanna.

35:13.510 --> 35:15.603
You're always the problem.

35:15.640 --> 35:16.732
What?

35:16.780 --> 35:18.202
The rest of us
are gettIng ulcers

35:18.250 --> 35:19.877
trying not to say
the wrong thing

35:19.910 --> 35:22.219
and you're getting hammered
in front of Emily's mom

35:22.250 --> 35:23.478
and blabbing
to a stranger.

35:23.520 --> 35:24.748
I told you I was sorry.

35:24.790 --> 35:28.749
No, you didn't tell me that.
"A" did.

35:28.790 --> 35:30.348
You couldn't even remember
what you sad.

35:30.390 --> 35:31.618
We were just
shouting out guesses

35:31.660 --> 35:33.480
trying to jog your memory.

35:33.530 --> 35:34.895
It's like playing charades
with drunky.

35:34.930 --> 35:36.227
Sounds like murder.

35:36.260 --> 35:37.488
That's not true.

35:37.530 --> 35:38.758
What'd you do, Hanna?

35:38.800 --> 35:40.222
Did you invite him
into your car?

35:40.270 --> 35:41.237
Why would I do that?

35:41.270 --> 35:42.498
Were you trashed?
No.

35:42.540 --> 35:43.893
If you want
to spiral out of control

35:43.940 --> 35:46.568
and self-destruct,
by all means go right ahead.

35:46.610 --> 35:48.373
But I sure as hell
am not gomg to let you

35:48.410 --> 35:49.377
take my mom down, too.

35:49.410 --> 35:51.207
( sighs )

35:57.750 --> 35:59.718
They're not gonna list
every visitor that's ever come.

35:59.750 --> 36:01.513
You don't know that.

36:01.560 --> 36:03.289
I'm looking
for Alison's handwriting.

36:10.830 --> 36:12.661
Did you find something?

36:12.700 --> 36:14.668
Why was this
hanging here?

36:14.700 --> 36:16.292
( horse neighing )

36:18.370 --> 36:19.405
What's it doing?

36:19.440 --> 36:20.668
This is my sister's.

36:20.710 --> 36:21.779
Look at the initials.

36:23.510 --> 36:25.398
M.H. Oh, my God.
How did you--

36:25.450 --> 36:26.747
I recognized the riding crest.

36:26.780 --> 36:27.804
It's where we used
to take lessons.

36:27.850 --> 36:28.919
What is it doing here?

36:30.720 --> 36:32.483
( neighing )

36:32.520 --> 36:34.454
Why is he so freaked out?

36:34.490 --> 36:35.889
It's the thunder.

36:35.920 --> 36:37.683
Let's go.
No, not yet.

36:37.720 --> 36:39.278
Spencer,
for God's sake,

36:39.330 --> 36:40.683
just take the helmet
with you, okay?

36:40.730 --> 36:42.425
I want to check the list again.
Maybe Melissa

36:42.460 --> 36:43.449
dgnedin
with a different name.

36:43.500 --> 36:44.694
Yeah, Maleficent, okay?

36:44.730 --> 36:46.493
I'm out of here.

36:46.530 --> 36:48.339
( neighing )

36:49.740 --> 36:52.334
Spencer, it's locked?
What?

36:59.050 --> 37:00.244
How do we get out of here?

37:02.280 --> 37:03.577
Oh, my God.

37:03.620 --> 37:04.587
Help!

37:04.620 --> 37:05.780
Somebody help!

37:10.920 --> 37:13.457
Quick,
grab the other end of this.

37:13.490 --> 37:14.798
What?
We climb to the roof?

37:14.830 --> 37:16.957
No, just push it up
against the gate. Hurry.

37:23.640 --> 37:24.868
( grunts )

37:24.910 --> 37:26.229
Oh, damn it!

37:28.640 --> 37:30.904
( neighing )

37:35.320 --> 37:36.878
Come on!

37:36.920 --> 37:37.909
Wait.

37:45.430 --> 37:46.454
( sighs )

37:50.460 --> 37:51.666
( knocking on door)

38:07.680 --> 38:09.272
Hi.
I got your message.

38:11.420 --> 38:12.785
Are you okay?

38:12.820 --> 38:14.082
What happened
to your eye?

38:14.120 --> 38:16.088
Something's
just stuck in it

38:16.120 --> 38:17.417
and I'm trying
to get it out.

38:18.560 --> 38:19.652
What's that smell?

38:19.690 --> 38:20.657
What smell?

38:20.690 --> 38:22.521
It smells like...

38:22.560 --> 38:24.391
Manure?

38:24.430 --> 38:26.796
Yeah, what is that?

38:26.830 --> 38:28.798
It's manure.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.694
Emily and I went
over to the stables

38:30.740 --> 38:32.560
where Mrs. DiLaurentis
used to take Bethany.

38:34.580 --> 38:36.536
Did you find something?

38:36.580 --> 38:38.309
Bethany apparently
didn't like to be bribed.

38:39.980 --> 38:41.948
And my sister's
riding helmet was there.

38:41.980 --> 38:42.969
Wait, what?

38:43.020 --> 38:44.988
Melissa's been up there, too?

38:45.020 --> 38:47.545
Possibly, unless "A" knew
that we were going out there

38:47.590 --> 38:48.852
and then
just planted it.

38:50.860 --> 38:52.725
What happened
to your eye, Spence?

38:55.000 --> 38:57.560
We got locked in this stall
and the horse next to us

38:57.600 --> 38:59.090
just went psychotic
and we got

38:59.130 --> 39:00.597
really close to being
kicked to death.

39:02.470 --> 39:03.994
So did "A" take
credit for this yet?

39:04.040 --> 39:05.769
Toby.

39:05.810 --> 39:07.869
I'm just-- I'm so tired
of feeling like this.

39:08.940 --> 39:10.032
Feeling like what?

39:12.550 --> 39:13.642
Powerless.

39:16.950 --> 39:19.111
That's what I wanted
to call and tell you.

39:19.150 --> 39:21.789
What, that you're lucky
you didn't get trampled?

39:21.820 --> 39:24.755
No. To tell you
that I'm sorry.

39:33.170 --> 39:34.762
What are you
talking about?

39:37.900 --> 39:40.869
If you becoming a cop
is going to put an end to this,

39:40.910 --> 39:43.037
then I say, go.

39:43.080 --> 39:45.139
Study hard,

39:45.180 --> 39:46.545
graduate early.

39:48.780 --> 39:50.611
Because coming back
to this house

39:50.650 --> 39:51.787
with my parents
split up and...

39:53.590 --> 39:55.512
Melissa being a part of this,
it's just--

40:00.190 --> 40:02.090
It's getting
so much worse.

40:11.100 --> 40:13.000
( cell phone vibrating )

40:21.210 --> 40:23.075
Why can't I get this?

40:23.120 --> 40:25.941
Sweetheart, there's a limited
amount of tissue paper

40:25.990 --> 40:27.639
around here.

40:27.690 --> 40:28.952
Are you shaming me?

40:28.990 --> 40:30.184
You have no shame.

40:30.220 --> 40:31.585
No shame--

40:37.830 --> 40:40.094
Oh, man,
look at yours.

40:40.130 --> 40:41.529
Master at work.

40:41.570 --> 40:42.935
Is your son
great at this, too?

40:42.970 --> 40:45.859
No, which is
why he's hiding upstairs.

40:45.910 --> 40:49.038
Okay, I'm gonna
take a break.

40:50.110 --> 40:53.602
Oh. Movie time?

40:53.650 --> 40:55.743
No, I-- I think
I'm just gonna go to bed.

40:55.780 --> 40:57.008
Really?

40:57.050 --> 40:58.074
But you said this morning
you wanted

40:58.120 --> 40:59.087
to watch that one.

40:59.120 --> 41:01.111
That's why we got it.

41:01.150 --> 41:02.959
Is everything okay?

41:02.990 --> 41:04.582
Yeah.

41:05.990 --> 41:07.218
You know what?

41:07.260 --> 41:09.728
Let's watch it.
I'll rally.

41:22.810 --> 41:24.107
I'm not leaving
another voicemail.

41:24.140 --> 41:25.846
Who are you
trying to call?

41:25.880 --> 41:27.973
Aria.
She won't call me back.

41:28.010 --> 41:29.568
Have you heard
from Aria?

41:29.620 --> 41:31.178
No, I just got off the phone
with Hanna though.

41:31.220 --> 41:33.245
What's with the cop car
in your driveway?

41:33.290 --> 41:35.110
He brought me here
so I could get my
dad's numbers in Westport.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.912
And I told him I need
to pack up a few more things.

41:36.960 --> 41:38.109
How's Hanna's mom?

41:38.160 --> 41:40.128
She's a basket case.

41:40.160 --> 41:41.923
I mean, is this how it's
going to be from now on?

41:41.960 --> 41:44.599
Our parents are going
to be physically attacked, too?

41:44.630 --> 41:46.598
This is not the same "A"
who got their jollies

41:46.630 --> 41:48.598
breaking into our lockers
and leaving nasty notes.

41:48.640 --> 41:49.891
This "A" is...
NoelKahn.

41:52.770 --> 41:54.874
What did you say?

41:54.910 --> 41:57.208
I asked Noel to break
into Hanna's house tonight.

41:57.240 --> 41:59.504
That's who was in the kitchen.
It was Noel.

42:00.650 --> 42:02.618
I needed someone
who mattered.

42:02.650 --> 42:05.016
Someone like Hanna's mom
to stop questIonIng

42:05.050 --> 42:06.039
what happened to me.

42:06.090 --> 42:07.682
Why would you do that?

42:07.720 --> 42:10.188
Well, it worked,
didn't it?

42:18.230 --> 42:25.636
* What child is this,
who laid to rest on *

42:25.670 --> 42:33.042
* Mary's lap,
is sleeping *

42:33.080 --> 42:40.714
* Whom angels greet
with anthem sweet *

42:40.750 --> 42:49.749
* While shepherds
watch are keeping *
