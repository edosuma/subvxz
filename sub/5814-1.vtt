00:45.320 --> 00:47.800
Welcome to Camp Blue Finch,

00:48.560 --> 00:52.007
where romance in the sun
can turn deadly!

00:53.560 --> 00:55.801
Best summer ever!

00:57.800 --> 01:00.260
This is the summer
that's going to change your life.

01:00.360 --> 01:01.500
Where the days are warm...

01:01.600 --> 01:06.083
- Hey, Nance, that guitar is choice.
- Thanks, Blake. Bitching hair.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.340
...the girls are cool...

01:08.440 --> 01:10.060
Did I miss the Kumbaya circle?

01:10.160 --> 01:12.527
...the nights are always hot.

01:12.960 --> 01:15.088
And evil lurks around every corner.

01:15.240 --> 01:17.686
Gosh, you startled me.

01:17.840 --> 01:19.580
So, I just go down that path
all the way?

01:19.680 --> 01:22.331
A guy like you can go anywhere he wants.

01:23.360 --> 01:27.160
And any moment, Billy can strike.

01:36.080 --> 01:37.844
They won't be singing Kumbaya.

01:39.800 --> 01:43.361
They'll be screaming Kum Ba No!

01:44.560 --> 01:46.940
Pack your bags for Camp Bloodbath...

01:47.040 --> 01:49.380
You just messed with the wrong virgin.

01:49.480 --> 01:54.008
...where the only marshmallow
that will roast is your sanity.

02:40.560 --> 02:43.928
Well, they'll let me know.

02:44.360 --> 02:46.860
You know
you're too good for this crap, right?

02:46.960 --> 02:49.620
The casting director was all like,
"I know you from somewhere."

02:49.720 --> 02:53.740
And I went, "Really? It's probably
my arc on CSI as a bipolar mistress."

02:53.840 --> 02:56.764
And he's like, "No, I got it.
Camp Bloodbath."

02:57.600 --> 03:01.810
Am I ever going to live that movie down?
I mean, it was 20 years ago.

03:01.920 --> 03:04.685
Honestly, if you ever become an actor,
don't ever do a slasher flick.

03:04.920 --> 03:07.740
You wouldn't catch me dead in a movie.
You're the actress here.

03:07.840 --> 03:12.767
Damn straight. And I'm no actress.
I'm a movie star.

03:17.840 --> 03:18.841
Mel's?

03:20.840 --> 03:21.841
Mel's.

03:23.040 --> 03:24.451
Let's rock and roll.

03:28.760 --> 03:32.860
So, we owe the electric company
$174.88 by next Monday...

03:32.960 --> 03:35.780
You remember Frank?

03:35.880 --> 03:38.580
He told me he was going to take me
to Palm Springs this weekend.

03:38.680 --> 03:41.047
- No message. No text.
- No surprise.

03:41.160 --> 03:43.620
You know,
it's just he said we were exclusive.

03:43.720 --> 03:45.688
Well, he said it,
he doesn't act like it.

03:47.680 --> 03:48.806
Whatever. What do I know?

03:51.280 --> 03:53.060
You must think I'm a total zero.

03:53.160 --> 03:56.289
Screw him, Mom. And screw
his shady hotel in Palm Springs.

03:57.240 --> 04:01.006
Oh, my God.
Look at you taking care of me.

04:02.280 --> 04:04.820
What happened to that little girl
I used to dance with in the backyard?

04:04.920 --> 04:09.164
She grew up and is trying to figure out
where this $174 is gonna come from.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.682
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

04:15.880 --> 04:16.927
Our song!

04:18.920 --> 04:20.603
Mom. We need to figure this out.

04:21.519 --> 04:24.285
Her hair is Harlowe gold

04:25.720 --> 04:28.644
Her lips sweet surprise

04:29.720 --> 04:31.020
Her hands are never cold

04:31.120 --> 04:32.610
You're such a dork.

04:33.720 --> 04:35.900
She's got Bette Davis eyes

04:36.000 --> 04:38.082
Everything in my life, I got wrong.

04:38.960 --> 04:40.689
But you, I got you right.

04:41.360 --> 04:43.727
I love you. You know that, right?

04:44.360 --> 04:47.045
She's pure as New York snow

04:48.360 --> 04:49.420
She's got Bette Davis eyes

04:49.520 --> 04:50.567
What?

04:52.040 --> 04:53.041
Nothing.

04:54.080 --> 04:55.081
Nothing.

04:55.840 --> 04:57.649
She'll unease you

04:58.000 --> 05:01.447
All the better just to please you

05:01.920 --> 05:05.660
She's precocious and she knows just

05:05.760 --> 05:10.084
What it takes to make a pro blush

05:10.240 --> 05:14.380
She got Greta Garbo stand off sighs

05:14.480 --> 05:18.405
She's got Bette Davis eyes

05:18.960 --> 05:20.644
Max, those are really expensive...

06:33.640 --> 06:35.404
Gertie's here.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.809
Coming, Aunt Pearl.

06:45.680 --> 06:49.420
So, when Chris asked you to study,
was he like,

06:49.520 --> 06:51.020
"I want you to come study"?

06:51.120 --> 06:54.806
Or was he like, "I want you to come.

06:56.320 --> 06:57.620
"Study."

06:57.720 --> 07:00.020
Please. I'm only going,
so I don't flunk Classics.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.100
Come on, you know that he broke up
with Vicki last week, right?

07:02.200 --> 07:03.980
And she is a mess.

07:04.080 --> 07:08.420
Have you seen the veiled suicide note/poem
she posted on her Facebook page?

07:08.520 --> 07:10.900
It's so hilarious.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.924
I read it out loud to myself. A lot.

07:19.400 --> 07:22.300
Hey, just keep on keeping on.

07:22.400 --> 07:25.768
- What does that even mean?
- Something my therapist tells me all the time.

07:26.160 --> 07:28.083
You have a therapist?

07:28.360 --> 07:30.420
Does that help you deal?

07:30.520 --> 07:34.889
No, not really.
She's a physical therapist, so...

07:36.480 --> 07:38.900
Okay. So, the myth of Persephone.
Max, you want to take this one?

07:39.000 --> 07:40.740
Sure.

07:40.840 --> 07:44.660
She's the daughter of Zeus
and she eats pomegranate seeds,

07:44.760 --> 07:47.820
and then
Hades kidnaps her to the underworld.

07:47.920 --> 07:48.980
Yeah. Okay, good.

07:49.080 --> 07:51.620
So, they go back to the underworld
and Persephone is freaking out,

07:51.720 --> 07:52.980
and Hermes is like,
"It's okay, it's okay.

07:53.080 --> 07:55.860
"Just keep looking forward,
or we'll be stuck here forever."

07:55.960 --> 07:58.860
Max, do you want to jot
any of this down or...

07:58.960 --> 08:00.620
No, it's okay, Max.
I've already got a copy.

08:00.720 --> 08:04.964
You can copy from me later
or I can give it to you if you want.

08:06.160 --> 08:07.730
I'm gonna stop talking.

08:10.440 --> 08:12.740
- Shit.
- Max, hey, wait.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.860
- Did you not get my messages?
- Duncan. No.

08:14.960 --> 08:17.327
Please, come on. Please.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.363
Seriously, no.

08:19.560 --> 08:21.660
The Bath-maticians were so excited
when I told them

08:21.760 --> 08:24.127
that Amanda Cartwright's daughter
was my sister's best friend.

08:24.280 --> 08:27.648
- Step-sister.
- Why would you say that? That's so hurtful.

08:27.760 --> 08:30.380
Please, Max, I promised
that you'd be there.

08:30.480 --> 08:34.121
I am the assistant general manager
of the varsity. Think of my reputation.

08:34.240 --> 08:35.765
Wait. What are "Bath-maticians"?

08:35.880 --> 08:39.140
Camp Bloodbath fans.
It's kind of our awesome nickname.

08:39.240 --> 08:41.620
Did you know that a nickname
immediately becomes uncool

08:41.720 --> 08:44.100
- when you give it to yourself?
- You know what, Gertie?

08:44.200 --> 08:47.568
When my dad told me that I was going
to get a sister, I cried

08:47.680 --> 08:49.250
because that's all I'd ever wanted.

08:50.120 --> 08:53.806
But not like this. Not like this.

08:54.960 --> 08:55.961
Don't.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.441
Look, Camp Bloodbath
is like the granddaddy

09:00.560 --> 09:02.260
of all campsite slasher films, okay.

09:02.360 --> 09:06.020
Amazing production design, insane music,
over-the-top acting.

09:06.120 --> 09:07.500
It's a cult classic.

09:07.600 --> 09:10.980
Max's mom plays Nancy,
this sort of shy girl-next-door

09:11.080 --> 09:12.940
who gives up her butterfly
to some dumb jock,

09:13.040 --> 09:16.965
and Billy Murphy comes along
and chops her ass up on a waterbed.

09:17.920 --> 09:20.685
Sorry, Duncan. Tell your cult,
maybe I'll see them next year.

09:22.480 --> 09:24.980
I'll do all your Classics assignments
for the rest of the year.

09:25.080 --> 09:27.260
Papers, your homework, all of it.

09:27.360 --> 09:30.011
Gertie told me that you were failing.

09:30.160 --> 09:33.084
Please, Max, what do you say?
You wanna graduate, or not?

09:44.200 --> 09:45.281
Max!

09:46.920 --> 09:49.526
- Gertie!
- You scared me.

09:51.400 --> 09:53.164
Well, this will be fun.

09:53.280 --> 09:56.220
Being trapped in a movie theater
with a bunch of nerds.

09:56.320 --> 09:57.560
Yeah, sure.

09:58.480 --> 10:03.420
You know what was fun, though?
Watching Chris today, ogle over you.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.921
- Shut up.
- What? That's a word, right? Ogle?

10:06.040 --> 10:08.260
He likes you so much, it's so cute.

10:08.360 --> 10:11.420
Gertie. Get real. He's like a giant, okay?
So, imagine us together.

10:11.520 --> 10:13.170
- I'd need stilts to kiss him.
- Hey!

10:15.360 --> 10:16.361
- Hey!
- Hi.

10:17.120 --> 10:20.567
- What are you doing here?
- I figured you needed some moral support.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.340
Why, should I go?
Because I can if this is weird...

10:24.440 --> 10:28.220
No, don't be crazy, Christopher.
We're so happy you're here.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.561
I'm going to go popcorn up,
see you inside.

10:39.640 --> 10:42.484
Wow. Your mom was gorgeous.

10:44.320 --> 10:47.085
I'm sorry.
That's a weird thing to say, isn't it?

10:47.920 --> 10:49.046
Kind of.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.488
It's kind of cool we get to
honor her memory this way, right?

10:54.360 --> 10:56.567
Today's the anniversary of her death.

11:00.520 --> 11:01.726
I don't know what to say.

11:02.720 --> 11:03.960
Me neither.

11:05.960 --> 11:07.291
At least, I get to see her,

11:08.120 --> 11:10.441
even if she is being chased
by a psycho with a machete.

11:13.480 --> 11:16.165
- Stop, stop, stop.
- Great.

11:17.080 --> 11:19.580
Hey! What a coincidence!

11:19.680 --> 11:23.260
This is Tyson. We've been
hanging out and he's so funny.

11:23.360 --> 11:27.060
My abs are like shredded
from laughing so hard.

11:27.160 --> 11:28.460
Anyway, Tyson wanted
to come here tonight

11:28.560 --> 11:32.020
and I was like, "Oh, my God, no."
But here we are.

11:32.120 --> 11:34.180
So, you win, Tyson.

11:34.280 --> 11:36.726
So, you didn't see my post about it,
or anything?

11:36.840 --> 11:38.540
No, I don't go on your stupid Twitter,

11:38.640 --> 11:40.802
which, by the way,
has lost three more followers today.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.283
Anyway, see you guys inside, okay? Go.

11:46.800 --> 11:49.300
I'm so wiped
from all these applications.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.402
Even my safety schools,
Stanford and Cornell,

11:51.520 --> 11:54.380
I'm not gonna just half-ass them.
It's just not my style.

11:54.480 --> 11:57.211
I am lucky
that I even made it out tonight at all.

11:57.320 --> 11:58.845
Thank you, Adderall.

12:00.640 --> 12:01.980
Where'd Terry go?

12:02.080 --> 12:03.900
- Terry? Tyson?
- Tyson.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.447
Yeah, he just got like
super-sick super-fast.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.881
No, not the super-sick super-fast.

12:11.000 --> 12:16.882
Max, are they doing this because it's,
you know, the anniversary?

12:17.720 --> 12:21.060
Yeah, I'm here for an appearance.
I didn't think you'd...

12:21.160 --> 12:23.300
Come on, Max.
Of course, I would remember.

12:23.400 --> 12:26.483
I have really good memory.
It's not just the Adderall.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.260
Hey, do you want anything?

12:28.360 --> 12:31.980
I'm gonna go get a popcorn
and then we can dump M&M'S into it.

12:32.080 --> 12:34.924
That way, every handful is, like,
kind of suspenseful?

12:35.840 --> 12:36.820
Sure.

12:36.920 --> 12:39.740
Hey, Chris, I'm just gonna have
a Diet Coke and a child-size popcorn,

12:39.840 --> 12:42.260
but make sure to dump half of it
into the garbage. You remember, right?

12:42.360 --> 12:44.580
You know what,
I'm just going to come with you.

12:44.680 --> 12:48.446
She is the worst.
She's like a living nightmare.

12:49.360 --> 12:51.100
I can't believe
you used to be friends with her.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.420
Look, she's probably gonna pee on him

12:52.520 --> 12:53.700
- just to mark her territory.
- Gertie!

12:53.800 --> 12:54.847
Max!

12:54.960 --> 12:57.122
- Hey, hey, you came.
- Oh, God.

12:57.440 --> 12:58.965
All hail, Max!

13:00.080 --> 13:01.940
Sorry, I don't know why
I worshipped you then,

13:02.040 --> 13:03.140
I'm just excited to see you.

13:03.240 --> 13:06.820
You're also really weird.
You're very strange and weird.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.300
I can put you down for the Q&A, right?

13:09.400 --> 13:12.340
- After the show, do a little Q.
- No.

13:12.440 --> 13:14.060
And a little...

13:14.160 --> 13:16.367
I'll put you down as a maybe.
Okay, glad you're here.

13:48.160 --> 13:51.801
Hey, guys, we're here!

13:53.840 --> 13:56.002
Someone wake up
Sleeping Beauty back there.

14:01.760 --> 14:03.444
Are we there yet?

14:11.200 --> 14:12.361
You okay?

14:14.800 --> 14:15.801
Yeah.

14:17.320 --> 14:19.448
It all happened so long ago.

14:19.560 --> 14:22.131
Little Billy Murphy
went to camp here decades ago.

14:22.320 --> 14:26.928
And he was always picked on
for being different, ugly.

14:27.160 --> 14:30.528
And then one summer,
the hottest one on record,

14:30.640 --> 14:33.246
the counselors decided
to play a little prank on him.

14:37.120 --> 14:40.820
No one really knows
how Billy was before it happened.

14:40.920 --> 14:44.925
The counselors hated him,
and the other kids bullied him mercilessly.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.328
Stop! Go away!

14:51.960 --> 14:55.521
- Billy, open up.
- I know how to get him out.

15:19.600 --> 15:24.049
Soak this moment in, babe,
because you're always gonna remember me.

15:24.480 --> 15:28.020
- What does that tattoo mean?
- It was given to me in juvie.

15:28.120 --> 15:31.841
I was caught stealing cherries.
I'm a cherry thief.

15:36.480 --> 15:37.481
Neat.

15:54.280 --> 15:55.725
Nice legs.

15:56.760 --> 15:57.886
What time they open?

16:08.040 --> 16:09.041
Kurt?

16:17.360 --> 16:18.361
Kurt?

16:19.160 --> 16:21.242
I'm going to get some air.

16:49.080 --> 16:50.525
The exits are blocked!

16:51.640 --> 16:53.927
- Duncan, is there an exit behind the screen?
- Yes. Yes.

16:56.480 --> 16:57.766
- Come on!
- Go, go, go.

17:08.960 --> 17:10.040
Go, go, go.

17:47.080 --> 17:48.764
- Max!
- Oh, God! What happened?

17:48.880 --> 17:52.282
- Where the hell are we?
- I don't know. Did the theater burn down?

17:53.600 --> 17:56.524
That was the scariest thing
I have ever seen.

17:57.080 --> 17:59.620
You're alive! Thank God!

17:59.720 --> 18:01.860
What does poison ivy look like?
Because I think I got...

18:01.960 --> 18:02.961
Help me.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.001
Guys, somebody's coming.

18:20.320 --> 18:22.971
Hey, do you guys know
the way to Camp Blue Finch?

18:23.080 --> 18:25.208
- Tina!
- Yeah?

18:37.960 --> 18:40.964
Oh, my God.
I'm having a psychotic episode.

18:41.400 --> 18:45.450
- We all saw the same thing, right?
- Maybe it's a dream. A collective dream.

18:45.560 --> 18:47.700
If this is a dream,
then there's a very strong chance

18:47.800 --> 18:51.900
that my dad's going to come up to us
naked and offer us some pecan pie.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.322
But don't take any. It is not pecan pie.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.140
Maybe we're dead and this is heaven.

19:03.240 --> 19:05.820
This can't be heaven.
Max is here and she's Jewish.

19:05.920 --> 19:08.446
Right. Well, maybe it's Jewish heaven.

19:10.240 --> 19:11.241
Look!

19:23.240 --> 19:26.580
Hey, do you guys know
the way to Camp Blue Finch?

19:26.680 --> 19:29.843
Yeah. Just keep going
the way you're going.

19:30.320 --> 19:32.846
Wow, okay. Thanks so much.

19:35.720 --> 19:39.008
We're not dead. We're insane!

19:39.480 --> 19:43.485
No, we're not. And I don't think
we're in the Valley anymore.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.740
- Is anybody getting any bars?
- No.

19:50.840 --> 19:54.925
Eight, seven, six, five...

20:05.160 --> 20:07.740
Hey, do you guys know
the way to Camp Blue Finch?

20:07.840 --> 20:10.100
Yeah, actually we're counselors,

20:10.200 --> 20:12.940
and we can show you
if you'd just give us a ride.

20:13.040 --> 20:15.860
- Rad! Yeah, hop in.
- Tubular!

20:15.960 --> 20:18.201
Dude, what are you doing?

20:18.320 --> 20:22.405
Do we have a choice?
We're kind of stuck. Let's go.

20:22.600 --> 20:23.726
Max.

20:28.920 --> 20:29.967
Come on, guys.

20:34.320 --> 20:35.651
You guys coming?

20:42.480 --> 20:46.460
I can't believe you guys are counselors, too.
We've never had this many before.

20:46.560 --> 20:48.860
When the kids get here next week,
they're gonna be so pumped.

20:48.960 --> 20:50.580
Hey, where are you guys' suitcases?

20:50.680 --> 20:54.100
Because, honestly, your clothes,
they're disgusting.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.740
Says the guy in the crop top.

20:55.840 --> 20:59.580
What's up? Are you guys poor people?
Are you guys poor?

20:59.680 --> 21:03.700
We packed light. Yeah.
What did you pack, Tina?

21:03.800 --> 21:07.168
The basics, bikini,
mouthwash, diaphragm.

21:08.120 --> 21:11.522
Hell, yeah, you did.
'Cause they're gonna get so naked.

21:12.560 --> 21:13.721
How did you know?

21:15.120 --> 21:17.180
Spring break, forever.

21:17.280 --> 21:20.921
Hey, guys, we're here!

21:22.920 --> 21:25.446
Someone wake up
Sleeping Beauty back there.

21:34.320 --> 21:35.765
Are we there yet?

21:44.720 --> 21:45.960
Hi!

21:47.320 --> 21:49.049
I'm Nancy. What's your name?

21:52.160 --> 21:53.491
Max.

21:54.000 --> 21:59.689
First time away from home? It's okay.
It's hard to be away from your parents, huh?

22:09.040 --> 22:10.769
Best summer ever!

22:29.840 --> 22:31.001
Yes.

22:34.680 --> 22:38.969
Well, kiddo, this is the summer
that's going to change your life.

22:40.520 --> 22:41.521
No kidding.

22:42.320 --> 22:46.325
- Hey, Nance, that guitar is choice.
- Thanks, Blake. Bitching hair.

22:47.960 --> 22:50.964
Okay. So, we're in the movie.

22:51.440 --> 22:53.700
- How do we get outta here?
- Yeah, I like that question.

22:53.800 --> 22:54.900
That's a really, really good question.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.660
Duncan, can you answer
that question, please?

22:56.760 --> 23:00.860
What are you talking about? It's 1986!
Our homes don't exist yet.

23:00.960 --> 23:03.980
They're probably just landfills waiting to
be turned into crappy subdivisions.

23:04.080 --> 23:05.740
We don't exist yet.

23:05.840 --> 23:09.526
I know for a fact my parents haven't met
because I was an unplanned child.

23:10.600 --> 23:12.660
Anyone wanna help me
pick some strawberries?

23:12.760 --> 23:16.207
No, but I'll give you a hand
with those melons.

23:16.400 --> 23:19.220
Talking about her boobs!
You guys get me, right?

23:19.320 --> 23:21.004
Yeah, we do, brother.

23:22.760 --> 23:25.780
Kurt is insatiable.

23:25.880 --> 23:30.010
Okay, so Mimi's in the woods,
that means everything is right on schedule.

23:30.520 --> 23:33.220
- She hooks up with that hiker.
- But then she gets killed, right?

23:33.320 --> 23:36.820
Yeah, exactly. Everyone
who has sex in this movie dies.

23:36.920 --> 23:37.921
It's awesome.

23:38.920 --> 23:40.500
I got into bodybuilding big time.

23:40.600 --> 23:43.524
- Yeah. Oh, my God, can I touch it?
- Yeah, touch it.

23:43.640 --> 23:46.211
The backside's just as hard.
Touch the backside.

23:47.120 --> 23:49.122
That's right. Everyone.

23:49.400 --> 23:50.780
I'm with Gertie on this one.

23:50.880 --> 23:53.180
Let's just take their van and bail.
What do we have to lose?

23:53.280 --> 23:54.770
Yeah, did I say that? I did? Okay.

23:55.280 --> 23:58.045
We actually probably
shouldn't talk to them.

23:59.600 --> 24:03.940
- What's up, funbags?
- Funbags. Right. Yay, feminism.

24:04.040 --> 24:08.250
Listen, we need to borrow your van
for a little while. Is that okay? Yeah?

24:08.440 --> 24:11.410
I don't know. What's in it for me?

24:12.120 --> 24:14.487
How about my friends
don't kick your ass?

24:20.240 --> 24:23.140
This guy's your friend? Yeah, right.
You want to go?

24:23.240 --> 24:25.500
- No, no. God, no.
- Bicep, smash.

24:25.600 --> 24:27.740
And that would kill you.
That's a karate technique.

24:27.840 --> 24:30.940
No, I don't. I've never actually
fought anyone before in my life.

24:31.040 --> 24:32.849
Yeah, well, I have. So many times.

24:34.840 --> 24:36.046
Seven times.

24:36.720 --> 24:40.611
Hey, this is so weird. Do me a favor
and just zing me. Just get me.

24:40.720 --> 24:44.691
Fine. How about you go suck a turd?

24:46.720 --> 24:48.290
The writing is so bad.

24:48.840 --> 24:54.324
Okay, tell you what.
You find the keys and the van's yours.

24:58.320 --> 24:59.401
Really?

25:00.640 --> 25:02.700
- I'm glad that you die.
- What?

25:02.800 --> 25:06.771
Nothing! What she meant to say was,
that we all die eventually.

25:06.880 --> 25:09.620
Technically, we start dying
the moment we're born.

25:09.720 --> 25:10.767
Yeah, right.

25:11.880 --> 25:15.089
- Yes, but not to overwhelm you...
- Okay.

25:15.200 --> 25:16.660
I liked you
when you were laughing at my jokes.

25:16.760 --> 25:18.100
Now, I just think you're weird.

25:18.200 --> 25:20.680
Okay, let's just go get the... Sorry.
Let's go get the keys.

25:36.520 --> 25:38.648
Hey, you wanna give me a hand?

25:39.960 --> 25:40.961
Sure.

25:41.360 --> 25:45.365
- All right. Let's rock and roll.
- Oh, my God. It really is you.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.811
- What?
- Nothing.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.002
All right! Push-up time!

25:53.520 --> 25:54.521
So...

25:56.320 --> 25:59.051
Kurt told me he wants to do it later.

25:59.920 --> 26:02.780
- Wow. Just like that?
- I know!

26:02.880 --> 26:05.380
And it's like, I can't stay
a virgin forever, you know?

26:05.480 --> 26:08.140
And he's been with a lot of girls,
so he can probably, like,

26:08.240 --> 26:10.288
I don't know, help me along.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.128
- You shouldn't have sex!
- Why?

26:13.640 --> 26:15.540
Because I heard that sex can kill you.

26:15.640 --> 26:19.220
Max. Sex isn't anything to be afraid of.

26:19.320 --> 26:22.324
I mean, Tina's already done it twice today,
and look at her, she's totally normal.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.527
She says the best feeling in the world
is getting stoned and doing it on a waterbed.

26:32.560 --> 26:34.620
Don't hang around Tina.

26:34.720 --> 26:38.380
No, but I told myself that I was going
to lose my virginity this summer.

26:38.480 --> 26:41.927
- Get drunk! Not necessarily in that order.
- Please, just trust me.

26:42.880 --> 26:44.291
You sound like my mom.

26:45.600 --> 26:46.740
Right back at you.

26:46.840 --> 26:50.811
Hello, hi. We have to go get everyone.
Let's go.

26:50.920 --> 26:52.729
We will pick this up again.
Is that understood?

26:52.840 --> 26:56.003
In the meantime, just stay away from Kurt
and keep your shorts on.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.201
Okay.

26:58.760 --> 26:59.921
What are you doing?

27:01.320 --> 27:04.130
Dibs on the one that looks like
Ricky Schroder.

27:04.240 --> 27:06.925
Their hair's so flat.
It's making me sad.

27:07.720 --> 27:09.722
That girl with the freckles
is sort of cute.

27:09.840 --> 27:12.844
You know, none of them
are on the counselors' roster.

27:15.680 --> 27:18.126
Where did they come from?

27:22.600 --> 27:26.685
- We are never gonna find these keys.
- Not with that attitude, we're not.

27:27.480 --> 27:28.925
Though, you are correct.

27:37.920 --> 27:41.208
- Let's go back. Now.
- It's happening.

27:41.680 --> 27:43.380
- We have to warn her.
- No. No.

27:43.480 --> 27:46.620
Just think of them as animals
on a nature preserve, okay?

27:46.720 --> 27:50.167
Our duty is not to disrupt,
but to observe.

27:53.080 --> 27:56.243
Gosh, you startled me.

27:56.360 --> 27:58.300
Sorry, I'm looking for town.

27:58.400 --> 28:03.406
- So, I just go down that path all the way?
- A guy like you can go anywhere he wants.

28:04.040 --> 28:07.060
I can't believe we're just gonna
casually watch someone get murdered.

28:07.160 --> 28:08.446
What is this, Detroit?

28:13.200 --> 28:15.540
- What is that noise?
- It's Billy. He's coming.

28:15.640 --> 28:19.611
- Let's get out of here then.
- No, no. Stay, stay.

28:31.120 --> 28:33.805
- Did you hear something?
- Baby, I didn't hear a thing.

28:37.960 --> 28:42.124
Give me a second.
Go over there. Get ready.

28:55.720 --> 28:57.165
Okay! Where's the beef?

29:04.120 --> 29:06.930
Come on, man! I said, where's the...

29:21.520 --> 29:22.500
Run!

29:22.600 --> 29:24.011
Go, go, go, go!

29:24.320 --> 29:26.820
- Guys, guys, wait, wait, wait.
- Duncan!

29:26.920 --> 29:29.820
- What are you doing?
- Duncan.

29:29.920 --> 29:32.526
It's okay. He won't hurt us.

29:32.840 --> 29:34.365
He would've killed me by now, okay?

29:34.600 --> 29:37.500
I think it's because we're not
actually part of the movie,

29:37.600 --> 29:39.500
he doesn't really know
what to do with us.

29:39.600 --> 29:41.284
Isn't that right, Billy Boy?

29:41.840 --> 29:44.047
Man, you are big and scary.

29:44.720 --> 29:46.460
I wonder if all this blood
is just corn syrup, you know?

29:46.560 --> 29:47.820
Like these characters are walking around

29:47.920 --> 29:49.843
with just corn syrup in their veins,
you know?

29:50.720 --> 29:52.370
Let's give it a shot here.

29:54.240 --> 29:58.060
God. No, that is not corn syrup.

29:58.160 --> 30:00.481
That is... Oh, God, that's blood.

30:01.920 --> 30:03.660
All the more reason
for us to get the hell outta here.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.740
No, no. Look, everything in this world
is running exactly on schedule.

30:06.840 --> 30:08.251
Besides, to leave,

30:08.800 --> 30:11.220
we probably have to wait
until the movie's over, or something.

30:11.320 --> 30:12.820
Well, when is that going to happen?

30:12.920 --> 30:16.580
Okay, look, movies like this end
when the final girl kills the main bad guy

30:16.680 --> 30:19.180
and the credits roll.
It's actually pretty sick in this one.

30:19.280 --> 30:21.620
She kicks up the sword
and she kills him with his own machete

30:21.720 --> 30:24.740
and she's like... And Billy's like...
It goes right through his hands.

30:24.840 --> 30:25.841
Like...

30:27.800 --> 30:31.180
Head splits open. Punches it.

30:31.280 --> 30:32.964
- Brain goes out...
- Duncan!

30:34.560 --> 30:37.660
Anyway, this smoking
hot girl called Paula,

30:37.760 --> 30:40.001
she arrives in the next reel,
she's the final girl.

30:40.600 --> 30:45.260
Yeah, she is the only one in this movie
who doesn't die.

30:45.360 --> 30:47.260
All we've got to do is stick with her

30:47.360 --> 30:48.700
and we're going to have
the best seats in the house.

30:48.800 --> 30:51.580
Trust me,
this last battle will blow your minds.

30:51.680 --> 30:53.523
- Okay, selfie time.
- Duncan!

31:12.440 --> 31:15.330
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

31:32.680 --> 31:34.220
I think I almost just pissed my pants.

31:34.320 --> 31:36.766
- You did piss your pants.
- What? No, I didn't.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.002
Let's get out of here!

31:58.320 --> 32:00.846
Wait! Where are you going?
You're gonna miss the slumber party.

32:00.960 --> 32:02.724
You came back! Yay!

32:05.920 --> 32:06.921
This way!

32:07.120 --> 32:09.691
Wait! Where are you going?
You're gonna miss the slumber party.

32:09.800 --> 32:11.768
You came back! Yay!

32:13.480 --> 32:15.005
What is happening?

32:16.280 --> 32:19.020
Wait! Where are you going?
You're gonna miss the slumber party.

32:19.120 --> 32:21.043
You came back! Yay!

32:21.520 --> 32:23.682
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

32:26.280 --> 32:28.567
I don't think Billy's the only problem.

32:29.480 --> 32:32.529
It's the movie.
The movie won't let us leave.

32:40.200 --> 32:43.540
Michael, row your boat ashore

32:43.640 --> 32:46.644
Hallelujah

32:47.040 --> 32:50.044
Michael, row your boat ashore

32:50.480 --> 32:53.484
Hallelujah

32:53.760 --> 32:57.003
Sister, help to trim the sails

32:57.280 --> 33:00.284
Hallelujah

33:00.440 --> 33:03.780
Sister, help to trim the sails

33:03.880 --> 33:07.009
Hallelujah

33:07.400 --> 33:10.404
Jordan's river is deep and wide

33:10.800 --> 33:13.804
Hallelujah

33:14.160 --> 33:17.164
Got a home on the other side

33:17.440 --> 33:20.444
Hallelujah

33:20.720 --> 33:22.404
Come on, everyone. Sing along!

33:23.680 --> 33:27.060
Duncan is dead. We have to warn them.

33:27.160 --> 33:28.740
Please. They're morons.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.620
I wanna know where
they keep the hardware in this dump.

33:30.720 --> 33:33.166
I want chainsaws and I want
big-ass knives, and I want them now.

33:33.640 --> 33:35.927
What am I gonna tell our parents?

33:37.360 --> 33:39.886
I don't want to die here, guys.

33:40.960 --> 33:44.089
Me neither.
There's got to be a way to get home.

33:56.280 --> 33:58.009
Did I miss the Kumbaya circle?

33:58.160 --> 34:01.260
Paula, you're just in time to start
setting up for the slumber party.

34:01.360 --> 34:04.682
Yeah, we took a vote
and you get to share my sleeping bag.

34:05.200 --> 34:08.806
Thanks, Kurt. But I'm saving myself
for someone who doesn't have a needle dick.

34:09.880 --> 34:14.260
Yeah right,
it's like a hammer dick, if anything.

34:14.360 --> 34:15.407
It's a sledgehammer.

34:15.960 --> 34:17.007
Who are they?

34:18.560 --> 34:20.820
They're the new counselors.
They're super nice.

34:20.920 --> 34:25.164
- We don't have new counselors.
- Well, now we do.

34:25.280 --> 34:28.601
All right, guys, let's split up
into groups and get busy.

34:33.199 --> 34:34.900
That's her. That's Paula.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.179
She's the final girl, right?
She's the one that kills Billy.

34:37.280 --> 34:39.060
We just have to stay with her
till the end of the movie.

34:39.159 --> 34:41.219
I'm sticking to that bitch
like white on rice.

34:41.320 --> 34:43.860
Okay. Now, we just have
to keep Billy away from us.

34:43.960 --> 34:47.060
It's just like Duncan said. The moment
a top comes off, Billy shows up.

34:47.159 --> 34:50.980
Vicki, stick with Paula and Tina.
Gertie, you take Blake. Chris, take Kurt.

34:51.080 --> 34:54.060
- No, I want Chris to stick with me.
- No, we have to cover everyone.

34:54.159 --> 34:56.580
- I'll stick with my mom.
- You know that's not your mom, right?

34:56.679 --> 34:58.700
- Vicki!
- Don't defend her.

34:58.800 --> 35:00.962
This delusional shit
is gonna get us all killed.

35:13.000 --> 35:17.244
Look at the pair on her!
I would just motorboat those for hours.

35:17.360 --> 35:21.160
Yeah, but look at those articles,
I could read those all night long.

35:21.920 --> 35:26.860
What are you, a fag?
You don't like some nice big hoots?

35:26.960 --> 35:28.121
Hooting!

35:28.560 --> 35:30.927
My dads are gay. So, shut the hell up.

35:31.080 --> 35:33.420
Yeah, right! Gay guys can't have kids.

35:33.520 --> 35:36.820
They're too busy going to discos
and having sex with each other.

35:36.920 --> 35:39.002
It's actually a pretty cool lifestyle.

35:45.280 --> 35:46.700
- Hi.
- Hey.

35:46.800 --> 35:49.451
- I really like your pin.
- Thank you.

35:51.920 --> 35:54.500
- Where'd you get yours?
- My friends gave them to me.

35:54.600 --> 35:56.220
Where'd you get yours?

35:56.320 --> 36:02.123
I made it, actually,
at this prison pen-pal convention thing.

36:03.040 --> 36:04.246
That's awesome!

36:05.280 --> 36:06.281
Yeah.

36:09.120 --> 36:13.011
Hey, what's up with this cassette?
There are no holes in it.

36:14.760 --> 36:16.000
Give me that.

36:16.240 --> 36:19.608
- What are these?
- No, no. Bad!

36:20.040 --> 36:22.646
Not for you. Very bad!

36:30.040 --> 36:32.202
It's too bad all the girls
are so busted.

36:32.560 --> 36:35.803
The only way you or I are going
to get any is with angel eyes over there.

36:36.680 --> 36:39.126
What? Are you nuts?

36:39.320 --> 36:43.689
No, no, no.
These girls are slamming, my man.

36:44.120 --> 36:46.646
And I am going to do all of them.

36:47.920 --> 36:51.288
Yum! By the way, what's with you and Max?
Are you guys...

36:55.240 --> 36:56.380
Are you guys having sex?

36:56.480 --> 37:00.644
Because if not, I wouldn't mind
bench pressing her with my dumbbell.

37:01.600 --> 37:04.540
Listen, brah, you're not bench pressing
anyone with your dumbbell.

37:04.640 --> 37:07.140
If I so much hear your dumbbell
took a Pilates class...

37:07.240 --> 37:09.368
- What?
- ...I'm gonna cut it off.

37:11.040 --> 37:13.980
I swiped a whole case of this stuff
from my uncle before coming.

37:14.080 --> 37:15.980
I'm gonna need it
if I'm stuck here for the summer

37:16.080 --> 37:18.940
instead of souping up
this bitching firebird I found in...

37:19.040 --> 37:21.168
Yeah, yeah, yeah, great.
Where do they keep the chainsaws here?

37:21.440 --> 37:22.500
What?

37:22.600 --> 37:24.980
We might want to find out, right?
Where they keep them?

37:25.080 --> 37:28.482
Because you never know
when you might need a chainsaw.

37:29.040 --> 37:31.361
Why do we need a chainsaw
for a slumber party?

37:33.080 --> 37:37.244
I know what's going to go down
at this camp, and it's not pretty.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.401
So, where's that other guy
you came with?

37:46.320 --> 37:49.802
My brother. Yeah, he's...

37:50.720 --> 37:53.291
He's napping somewhere.

37:54.240 --> 37:59.121
Okay, let's go. You want to go? Yeah, let's.
You got all the wood you need.

38:16.680 --> 38:17.920
Mom, no!

38:25.240 --> 38:27.300
- Get dressed. Now.
- Oh, my God, Max!

38:27.400 --> 38:28.940
What are you doing here? Get out!

38:29.040 --> 38:31.580
Nancy, if you go through with this,
you're going to get hurt.

38:31.680 --> 38:34.126
Kurt said he liked me, okay. He said it.

38:34.800 --> 38:37.371
Yeah, they always say it,
they just don't act like it.

38:40.960 --> 38:43.122
God. You must think I'm a total zero.

38:50.160 --> 38:55.121
I just wanted to feel grown-up, special.

38:57.080 --> 38:59.082
You are special.

38:59.600 --> 39:01.900
I'm the shy girl with the clipboard
and the guitar.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.286
Special to who?

39:05.320 --> 39:06.731
Special to me.

39:11.280 --> 39:12.850
Who are you, Max?

39:15.760 --> 39:20.243
Soak this moment in, babe,
because you're always gonna remember me.

39:20.360 --> 39:21.361
Shit.

39:22.760 --> 39:27.402
Two for the price of one.
You babes just couldn't wait, could you?

39:27.520 --> 39:29.045
- We're leaving.
- Too late.

39:29.440 --> 39:32.922
Genie's already out of the bottle.
Make a wish.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.844
- Where's Max?
- I don't know. Do you hear that?

39:56.160 --> 39:58.208
What'd I say? Leave her alone!

40:04.800 --> 40:08.122
Lock the windows! Shut the curtains!
He can see us!

40:08.280 --> 40:09.980
Who is he?

40:10.080 --> 40:12.924
Max. You have to tell them about Billy.

40:13.320 --> 40:15.322
Oh, God. He's here.

40:16.360 --> 40:21.924
Not Billy Murphy?
I mean, he's just a legend.

40:22.080 --> 40:23.525
I love legends.

40:23.960 --> 40:28.124
Loch Ness, Bigfoot, Bon Jovi.
All of them.

40:29.480 --> 40:31.323
It all happened so long ago.

40:45.960 --> 40:48.406
Little Billy Murphy went
to camp here decades ago.

40:49.920 --> 40:52.780
And he was always picked on for being...

40:52.880 --> 40:53.860
Guys?

40:53.960 --> 40:56.008
...different, ugly.

40:57.080 --> 40:59.380
- And then one summer...
- This is bad.

40:59.480 --> 41:01.300
...the hottest one on record,

41:01.400 --> 41:04.370
the counselors decided
to play a little prank on him.

41:06.800 --> 41:08.211
What's happening?

41:20.200 --> 41:23.500
This is... What, are we home?

41:23.600 --> 41:26.444
God, why am I colorblind?
Am I having a stroke?

41:28.880 --> 41:30.166
I think we're in a flashback.

41:41.400 --> 41:44.300
It started as just another ordinary day.

41:44.400 --> 41:46.100
- But little did they know...
- What the hell is that voice?

41:46.200 --> 41:47.565
...something was about
to go horribly wrong.

41:48.080 --> 41:51.460
No one really knows
how Billy was before it happened.

41:51.560 --> 41:54.860
The counselors hated him,
and the other kids bullied him mercilessly.

41:54.960 --> 41:57.770
- Stop!
- Where'd you get these clothes?

42:01.120 --> 42:03.327
- Guys, that's Billy.
- Come on, Billy.

42:05.080 --> 42:07.420
Hey, what are you little idiots doing?

42:07.520 --> 42:09.420
Billy's in there,
and he's been in there forever.

42:09.520 --> 42:13.300
Billy locked himself in the outhouse,
thinking he'd be safe, but he was wrong.

42:13.400 --> 42:16.131
Billy. Billy, open up.

42:16.760 --> 42:18.683
I know how to get him out.

42:37.560 --> 42:41.645
Billy had third-degree burns all over his
body because of the counselors' prank.

42:42.200 --> 42:45.580
And the only thing that could distract
Billy from his terrible pain,

42:45.680 --> 42:48.620
was thinking about
what had been done to him.

42:48.720 --> 42:52.180
And during those long,
agonizing nights in the burn ward,

42:52.280 --> 42:55.170
Billy's fear was slowly replaced by
something else.

42:56.920 --> 42:57.967
Hatred.

42:58.800 --> 43:01.167
His face would never be the same.

43:01.520 --> 43:05.020
And so, he made a mask
to hide his scars on the outside,

43:05.120 --> 43:07.202
but his anger grew on the inside.

43:08.080 --> 43:10.740
All Billy wanted was to make
everyone as afraid

43:10.840 --> 43:13.525
as he was on that terrible day.

43:14.160 --> 43:18.449
He started his reign of terror
by returning to exact his revenge.

43:31.680 --> 43:34.380
He killed eight counselors that night.

43:34.480 --> 43:37.300
One for every month
he spent in that hospital bed.

43:37.400 --> 43:41.020
And legend has it Billy still lives
in these woods in his own little shack,

43:41.120 --> 43:46.889
waiting for new counselors to cross his path,
waiting to get revenge again and again.

44:02.560 --> 44:04.220
The car! The car!

44:04.320 --> 44:06.527
Guys, you can't leave! Literally!

44:13.800 --> 44:17.020
Get up! Get up! Stop!
Don't come any closer.

44:17.120 --> 44:19.282
Okay, just listen. We can explain.

44:19.440 --> 44:22.300
You can't leave. None of us can.

44:22.400 --> 44:24.562
- Not until he's dead.
- Until who's dead?

44:25.480 --> 44:27.005
- Billy Murphy.
- What?

44:29.720 --> 44:31.131
Drive! Drive!

44:35.080 --> 44:38.820
- Look, I'm just trying to save you.
- Why? Why are you trying to save me?

44:38.920 --> 44:40.410
Well, because you're my...

44:43.960 --> 44:45.166
My first friend here.

44:48.400 --> 44:49.860
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

44:49.960 --> 44:51.530
Help me. I'm not dead!

44:51.680 --> 44:53.648
Duncan! You're alive!

44:57.840 --> 45:00.340
No, you killed Duncan!

45:00.440 --> 45:04.460
Let's just go to a hotel
and just relax for the night

45:04.560 --> 45:06.688
and maybe we can get into something.

45:11.320 --> 45:13.721
Oh, my God, Kurt! Oh, my God!

45:13.880 --> 45:16.929
- Paula! She's alive!
- Paula, don't move!

45:23.800 --> 45:25.006
Shit!

45:31.400 --> 45:33.700
I can't believe they're all dead.

45:33.800 --> 45:36.380
They were never alive.

45:36.480 --> 45:38.540
They weren't real. Neither are you.

45:38.640 --> 45:40.940
Because this is just a movie,

45:41.040 --> 45:44.860
and Paula was the only one
that could kill Billy.

45:44.960 --> 45:46.371
We're screwed.

45:50.720 --> 45:53.246
What does she mean, "just a movie"?

45:58.920 --> 46:01.924
So, we're in a movie?

46:02.680 --> 46:07.180
But this is a horror movie,
and Billy Murphy's really after all of us.

46:07.280 --> 46:08.900
Why do I have to wear
all this stuff again?

46:09.000 --> 46:12.004
Because you're scripted to do
a striptease at the slumber party,

46:12.120 --> 46:14.521
and when you take your top off,
Billy comes running.

46:15.000 --> 46:18.980
But why does he hate my boobs?
Because they're not big?

46:19.080 --> 46:24.086
- So, wait, is new wave real?
- Yeah. Yeah, of course.

46:24.240 --> 46:26.447
But I'm not real.

46:26.960 --> 46:31.921
You're only real in the movie.
So, yeah, you're real here.

46:33.480 --> 46:34.686
Cool.

46:35.280 --> 46:38.620
- Guys, we just wanna get home.
- But, okay...

46:38.720 --> 46:40.580
But you said Paula was
the only one who could kill him.

46:40.680 --> 46:42.921
And she just died.

46:43.160 --> 46:46.482
Exactly. Which is why
we need to nominate a new final girl.

46:48.440 --> 46:49.771
And I'm willing to be it.

46:52.760 --> 46:56.526
- What?
- Well, you're not a virgin.

46:56.880 --> 46:58.564
I am, too, a virgin!

47:00.080 --> 47:03.448
I technically am that...
Whatever, what does it matter?

47:03.560 --> 47:05.642
Because it just does, Vicki.

47:06.200 --> 47:09.420
You have to be a virgin in this movie
in order to kill Billy, okay?

47:09.520 --> 47:13.923
And the only true-blue
virgin here is Max.

47:16.360 --> 47:17.566
I'm not the only virgin.

47:18.680 --> 47:21.445
- Gertie, you're a virgin.
- No. Not anymore.

47:22.560 --> 47:24.005
Last summer, with that guy Gerry.

47:24.560 --> 47:27.166
He had the like weird mustache
and he winked, remember?

47:27.280 --> 47:28.441
Isn't he autistic?

47:29.600 --> 47:33.605
Yeah. Yeah, he is.
But he's also very romantic.

47:33.720 --> 47:36.451
Damn, superfreak. I like!

47:37.400 --> 47:39.004
- Okay, let's make a plan.
- Yeah.

47:39.360 --> 47:42.540
- We need to get Billy's machete.
- The one he's holding?

47:42.640 --> 47:44.324
Yeah. Duncan said
that's the only way to kill him.

47:44.480 --> 47:45.527
Everything else just slows him down.

47:45.680 --> 47:47.330
So, we're supposed to
just pry it from his hands?

47:47.480 --> 47:50.450
Well, we don't really have
any other options. Okay?

47:50.600 --> 47:52.740
Look, we just have to get
his machete into Max's hands

47:52.840 --> 47:56.128
so she can chop his head off,
end the movie, and we can all go home.

47:57.880 --> 48:00.486
No. No way! I can't do this.

48:00.680 --> 48:02.540
See? She's even saying
that she can't do it.

48:02.640 --> 48:05.246
Vicki! Enough! Jesus!
Can you just shut up for a second?

48:05.360 --> 48:07.124
God! I can't believe
I put up with you for so long.

48:08.840 --> 48:10.763
- Max, you got this.
- No.

48:11.240 --> 48:13.720
Max. You can do this.

48:14.120 --> 48:16.820
If it wasn't for you, we'd all be dead
burning in the theater right now.

48:16.920 --> 48:18.285
Yeah, and look where I got us.

48:20.400 --> 48:23.980
I can do it. I can be the final girl.
I'm a virgin, too.

48:24.080 --> 48:25.844
I didn't sleep with Kurt.

48:26.000 --> 48:29.368
So, now I guess I'll be able to save myself
for George Michael after all.

48:29.480 --> 48:32.484
- I wouldn't hold your breath, honey.
- Why?

48:33.400 --> 48:36.165
It doesn't matter.
Nancy, you can't be the final girl.

48:36.280 --> 48:38.300
It's not in your DNA, or whatever.

48:38.400 --> 48:40.220
You're the shy girl
with the clipboard and the guitar.

48:40.320 --> 48:41.401
You get laid and then you die.

48:41.520 --> 48:44.126
You're just part of the body count.
No offense.

48:49.440 --> 48:51.090
That came out wrong.

48:53.120 --> 48:55.168
- Thanks a lot.
- Max.

48:56.520 --> 48:58.204
I was just trying to help.

49:08.360 --> 49:09.361
Nancy?

49:14.920 --> 49:16.763
Am I really gonna die?

49:20.880 --> 49:21.961
Yeah.

49:22.480 --> 49:25.609
So, I guess I never grow up,

49:27.240 --> 49:29.607
or fall in love or have kids.

49:30.880 --> 49:34.300
I had this dream
that when I graduated college,

49:34.400 --> 49:36.801
I would meet a guy.

49:37.720 --> 49:40.087
And we'd have a baby. A girl.

49:40.320 --> 49:45.804
And if she ever needed me,
I would do anything for her. Anything.

49:49.600 --> 49:52.410
I would've made a really great mom.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.490
The best.

50:00.840 --> 50:04.367
God, this totally sucks! It's so bogus!

50:04.560 --> 50:06.500
I should have known
something was up with this place.

50:06.600 --> 50:07.660
I mean, think about it.

50:07.760 --> 50:10.445
What the hell kind of summer camp
has waterbeds?

50:20.280 --> 50:22.487
What do we do now?

50:27.440 --> 50:28.771
We fight.

50:29.960 --> 50:33.220
All right, guys.
No more junior varsity bullshit.

50:33.320 --> 50:37.100
We gotta lead with a pro-style offense.
Something Billy won't see coming.

50:37.200 --> 50:39.060
We have to use everything we have
at our disposal.

50:39.160 --> 50:40.980
I was thinking
the best opportunity for an ambush

50:41.080 --> 50:43.380
would be the slumber party,
with a few tweaks.

50:43.480 --> 50:46.220
That means it's just a question of
luring him here at just the right time.

50:46.320 --> 50:48.721
- How are we going to do that?
- I think I have an idea.

50:50.480 --> 50:52.140
"Operation Booby Trap?"

50:52.240 --> 50:55.210
Yup. And Tina's going to be the bait.

51:44.520 --> 51:45.806
Vicki, are you crying?

51:46.880 --> 51:48.120
I'm fine.

51:53.360 --> 51:56.220
Gertie, I'm sorry for that time
in junior high

51:56.320 --> 51:58.740
when I told everyone
to start calling you "Ba-chunk-adunk."

51:58.840 --> 52:03.460
And then I covered your locker in bacon.
That was so crappy.

52:03.560 --> 52:05.608
And I'm so sorry.

52:06.480 --> 52:09.540
- I'm such a bad person.
- You're not. It's okay.

52:09.640 --> 52:11.140
If it makes you feel better,

52:11.240 --> 52:13.322
last summer,
I'm the one who spread the rumor

52:13.440 --> 52:16.091
that said you had a weird disease
where you're always on your period.

52:17.000 --> 52:20.004
- Wow. That's evil.
- Thank you.

52:22.480 --> 52:27.100
Hey, Max, if I'm going to die tonight,
then I don't want to die without telling you

52:27.200 --> 52:33.048
that when your mom died,
you shut down completely.

52:33.960 --> 52:36.008
And just cut me out of your life.

52:37.240 --> 52:40.084
And I missed you.
I missed our friendship.

52:40.920 --> 52:45.300
And then you two became best friends
and, I don't know, I got jealous.

52:45.400 --> 52:49.300
And so, I did some really bad things
and I'm not proud of them.

52:49.400 --> 52:52.020
- Vicki.
- No, no, no, just let me finish, okay.

52:52.120 --> 52:55.820
- I know that I've become a...
- A bitch?

52:55.920 --> 53:01.609
Yes, thank you. But the thing is, Max,
I've always looked up to you

53:01.920 --> 53:04.241
because you were always the brave one.

53:05.520 --> 53:07.284
So, be brave again.

53:09.120 --> 53:10.770
Vicki, you don't have to die.

53:12.680 --> 53:14.700
I'm the mean girl
in the '80s horror movie.

53:14.800 --> 53:17.451
And we're past the mid-point,
so, you know,

53:19.600 --> 53:21.921
I'd say that I've overstayed my welcome.

53:36.400 --> 53:39.620
No, no, no! No. No, Tina.

53:39.720 --> 53:42.420
Tina, hey. Yeah. No.

53:42.520 --> 53:45.967
You know not to take off any
of your clothes until we say so, right?

53:46.440 --> 53:48.761
- Yeah.
- No sex.

53:49.640 --> 53:53.008
How could anyone think about sex
when I have this rad gadget?

53:53.640 --> 53:55.961
- What is this thing, anyway?
- It's a phone.

53:59.040 --> 54:01.441
Yeah. Please, I'm not that gullible.

54:02.400 --> 54:05.420
Hello, operator?
Yes, I'm trying to make a call

54:05.520 --> 54:08.364
but I can't because
my phone's not plugged into anything.

54:10.160 --> 54:11.220
Oh, my God, kill me.

54:11.320 --> 54:13.402
Guys, it's almost time. Let's get ready.

54:13.520 --> 54:14.681
Okay.

54:18.760 --> 54:19.921
How you holding up?

54:20.840 --> 54:23.366
Been better. How about you?

54:26.200 --> 54:28.248
I'm really scared.

54:30.520 --> 54:32.124
Are the arrows ready?

54:32.720 --> 54:35.291
Yeah, I'm on it.

54:44.480 --> 54:46.005
"Adderall."

54:53.680 --> 54:55.940
God, your parents
must be freaking out right now.

54:56.040 --> 55:00.250
You've been gone for hours.
They must be so worried about you.

55:00.480 --> 55:04.883
Not really. I never knew my dad.
And my mom's away.

55:07.800 --> 55:09.131
What's she like?

55:10.000 --> 55:14.927
She was so beautiful and funny.

55:17.440 --> 55:19.283
She never knew how awesome she was.

55:20.160 --> 55:21.446
How'd she die?

55:22.400 --> 55:26.610
- I never said she died.
- You said "was." So, I just figured.

55:27.200 --> 55:29.123
It's okay. You don't have to tell me.

55:30.440 --> 55:33.284
Here, I want you to have this.

55:37.200 --> 55:40.682
It's a friendship bracelet.
So, you don't forget me.

55:41.800 --> 55:44.246
How could I ever forget you?

55:45.960 --> 55:50.340
You know, if this all works out,
I'm really gonna miss you.

55:50.440 --> 55:51.930
When you go home, I mean.

55:53.480 --> 55:57.610
God, I sound totally molded. I know
we just met, it's silly for me to say that.

55:57.760 --> 56:01.980
It's just... I guess it's like,
who am I going to talk to after you leave?

56:02.080 --> 56:04.128
You know? Tina?

56:05.200 --> 56:06.611
She's not very smart.

56:07.680 --> 56:10.331
- Maybe you don't have to.
- I don't?

56:10.800 --> 56:13.700
I mean, I carpool with her to camp,
it's kind of inevitable.

56:13.800 --> 56:16.246
No, I mean,
maybe you don't have to stay here.

56:16.840 --> 56:19.002
Look, I know in the movie,
you're supposed to die,

56:19.200 --> 56:20.884
but that doesn't mean
you have to, right?

56:21.880 --> 56:24.645
- Right.
- And if you don't die,

56:24.760 --> 56:27.969
then that means you'll be around
at the end of the movie, when we leave.

56:28.360 --> 56:29.361
Right.

56:29.480 --> 56:33.644
So, then who's to say
you can't just come home with me?

56:34.720 --> 56:35.960
Oh, my God.

56:37.680 --> 56:39.284
- Where's home?
- The Valley.

56:40.440 --> 56:41.521
The Valley.

56:43.160 --> 56:44.380
I don't know, Max, I don't know.

56:44.480 --> 56:46.980
You're just... You're kind
of blowing my mind right now.

56:47.080 --> 56:48.650
No, think about it!

56:49.520 --> 56:53.140
If you come home with me,
you can be whoever you want.

56:53.240 --> 56:56.420
You don't have to be the shy girl
with the clipboard and the guitar.

56:56.520 --> 56:58.488
- You could be...
- I could, like, go to college.

56:58.600 --> 57:00.409
- And drive a convertible.
- Right. Totally!

57:00.520 --> 57:01.851
An go shopping at the mall.

57:02.200 --> 57:04.771
Actually, people don't really shop
at malls anymore. They shop online.

57:04.880 --> 57:05.881
What's online?

57:06.600 --> 57:08.820
Never mind, I made that up.
Just keep going!

57:08.920 --> 57:12.460
Okay! I wanna shop online
and I wanna start over.

57:12.560 --> 57:15.803
You know, I could be different
in the Valley.

57:28.760 --> 57:30.603
What if I don't make it, Max?

57:33.520 --> 57:35.204
This time, you will.

57:35.920 --> 57:37.001
Hey, guys.

57:39.120 --> 57:43.967
Hi. So sorry to interrupt,
but we have a bit of a situation.

57:49.160 --> 57:52.340
- Tina, are you...
- I'm great! I'm amazing!

57:52.440 --> 57:56.445
- She ate your Adderall?
- Tina, hey. Eyes here.

57:58.400 --> 57:59.420
Yes.

57:59.520 --> 58:02.171
How many of my Tic Tacs did you have?

58:02.400 --> 58:05.688
They're not Tic Tacs! And I had three.

58:06.040 --> 58:08.020
No, 10 or 30!

58:08.120 --> 58:10.300
- It was 30!
- Maybe we need to re-strategize.

58:10.400 --> 58:13.290
No, no, no. I got this. I got this.

58:13.560 --> 58:14.700
Tina.

58:14.800 --> 58:18.725
- Are you sure you can...
- Look, man, I got this, all right?

58:18.920 --> 58:22.402
I got this! I so got this.

58:23.360 --> 58:26.250
She'll be fine.
I really think she's more focused now.

58:26.360 --> 58:28.044
- Right, Tina?
- Yes!

58:31.800 --> 58:34.121
Guys. Let's start.

58:39.160 --> 58:42.767
All right, guys. This is it.
Sound off. Ready.

58:43.840 --> 58:45.365
Ready! Ready! Ready!

58:45.720 --> 58:47.848
- Totem pole?
- Ready!

58:47.960 --> 58:49.860
- Stereo?
- Ready.

58:49.960 --> 58:51.530
- Arrows?
- Ready!

58:54.040 --> 58:57.408
All right then, Nancy,
unleash the beast.

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:05.962
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, he's coming. He's coming!

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:08.380
- He's coming!
- Not yet. Wait to move!

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.244
No, no! He's so close!

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.165
Tina!

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.291
Cut the rope!

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.564
- Gertie.
- Yeah?

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:32.641
I love you.

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:34.721
Screw it.

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:04.768
Everybody in the kitchen! Now!
Now! Go now!

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:12.286
It's okay. It's gonna be fine.

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:17.208
Gertie, come on. Hurry up!

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.411
Go!

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:42.964
Go, go, go! Go!

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:46.561
Come on, Nancy. Come on.

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:56.121
Shit!

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:57.961
It's stuck!

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:07.330
We're stuck! We're stuck!

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.409
No!

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.964
Max, it's okay.

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:25.721
Just go.

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:32.325
Go.

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:09.448
What's happening?

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:16.049
It's slow motion.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:20.845
Jump!

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:36.940
- Flashback! Flashback! Flashback!
- What?

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.660
- Just say the words!
- What words?

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:40.860
Billy Murphy was a kid
who went to camp here years ago.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.644
Tell me the story again! Hurry!

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:44.860
He was always picked on
for being different, ugly.

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.291
Keep going. Don't stop!

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:47.900
And then one summer,
the hottest one on record,

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.287
the kids decided to play
a little prank on him.

01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:00.171
- Where the hell are we?
- A flashback!

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:03.044
Does that mean we're safe?

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:18.282
Holy crap, this thing is heavy.

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:22.331
Guys, where's Billy?

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:26.220
Billy locked himself in the outhouse,
thinking he'd be safe, but he was wrong.

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:27.845
Oh, my God, that's me!

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:31.407
That's what I sound like?

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:39.209
- Look at him run!
- Wait.

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:40.850
Where's Billy going?

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:42.521
Wait.

01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:00.803
I don't know that part of camp.
I've never seen that cabin before.

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:09.740
- Shit! End the flashback! End it!
- Just skip to the end!

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:13.401
Legend has it Billy still lives in these woods
waiting for new counselors to cross his path,

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:15.409
waiting to get revenge again and again.

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:22.690
- Did we leave him there?
- I wouldn't count on it. Let's move.

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:38.806
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:41.487
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Max!

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:44.041
- Max!
- No!

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:45.580
Let me go! Let me go!

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:47.364
- She's gone, Max.
- No! She's alive! She's...

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:49.244
Max, she's gone.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.171
No. She's not.

01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:58.641
Come on.

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:26.161
Keep pressure on it.
Don't move, I'll be back.

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:28.130
Max, she's dead.

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:32.761
She's supposed to die,
just like the rest of them.

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:36.100
No, she's lived this far into the movie,
longer than she ever has before.

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:37.645
She's not real.

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:41.140
- None of this is real.
- Yes, she is!

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:42.446
Max, wait.

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:48.482
I don't wanna die alone.

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:56.843
Listen to me. You're not gonna die.

01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:59.443
Nobody else is dying tonight.

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:04.684
I know exactly where he's taken her.

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:38.211
Hey, Nancy.

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:43.808
Max? Max!

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:55.964
He was right there.

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:33.481
No!

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:46.161
Get up!

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:50.162
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.644
Come on, come on.

01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:07.650
- Chris.
- Max, over here.

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:10.324
Sit down.

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:20.570
- Am I dying?
- No. I know how to fix it.

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:25.525
You're not the final girl yet, Max.
Because of me. I'm still alive.

01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.540
- No.
- Yes.

01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:31.008
No! I'm already dying,
so you could survive!

01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:35.205
- You can be the final girl.
- No, Max. No.

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:38.122
That's not who
I'm supposed to be, remember?

01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:41.047
I'm just the shy girl
with the clipboard and the guitar.

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:43.608
Yeah, but you wanted to change that.

01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:48.525
- Honey, let me do this.
- No.

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:52.486
Max, I'm not afraid.

01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:57.484
I wanted to save you.

01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:01.842
Max, you did.

01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:04.900
You did, Max.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.402
Just by letting me be here with you.

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:13.380
I've never felt more real
or more alive ever before.

01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:14.606
No.

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:18.122
No, Mom, you belong at home, with me.

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:23.220
Look, your name is Amanda Cartwright,
and you live in Encino,

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:26.660
and you love Bette Davis Eyes
and Mel's Diner.

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:32.324
And you wanted to be the biggest movie star,
more than anything in the world.

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:36.685
And you had a daughter.

01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.530
You have a daughter.

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:48.202
I'm not going back without you.

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.802
I don't wanna lose you again.

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:55.960
Max.

01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:01.804
I'm not lost. I'm right here, all right?

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:04.681
You'll always know
where to find me, okay?

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.764
But you have to let me go.

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:10.730
You have to let me go.

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:35.571
Bye, Max.

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:46.491
I love you.

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:52.688
That's what I never got to tell her.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.365
Don't worry.

01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:59.609
Wherever she is, she knows.

01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:02.843
You were right
about one thing, you know?

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:04.841
What?

01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:07.484
I'm a movie star.

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:32.281
Her hair is Harlowe gold

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:36.926
Her lips sweet surprise

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:40.925
Her hands are never cold

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:44.580
She's got Bette Davis eyes

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:46.887
She'll turn her music on you

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:51.087
You won't have to think twice

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:55.121
She's pure as New York snow

01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:59.370
She got Bette Davis eyes

01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:03.884
And she'll tease you

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.884
She'll unease you

01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:09.841
All the better just to please you

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:13.927
She's precocious and she knows just

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:18.404
What it takes to make a pro blush

01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:22.700
She got Greta Garbo stand off sighs

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:26.725
She's got Bette Davis eyes

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:34.806
She'll let you take her home

01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:38.282
It whets her appetite

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:43.085
She'll lay you on her throne

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:46.700
She got Bette Davis eyes

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:49.485
She'll take a tumble on you

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:53.041
Roll you like you were dice

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:57.127
Until you come out blue

01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:01.170
She's got Bette Davis eyes

01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:51.968
You just fucked with the wrong virgin.

01:18:58.120 --> 01:18:59.281
It's over.

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:34.201
- What is happening?
- I don't know.

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:42.681
Hold on tight!

01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:22.601
This food is so disgusting.

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:26.084
Speak for yourself, girl.
This tapioca pudding is incredible!

01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:29.723
You've had like 15 of those
in the last 30 minutes.

01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:31.450
I counted them, 15!

01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:34.281
Little known fact,
I can't stand tapioca pudding.

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:37.683
- Then why did you eat 30 of them?
- Let me eat my feelings in peace.

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:39.847
- Max!
- Hey!

01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:41.886
You're awake!

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:52.047
When you get a second, try the pudding.

01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:57.926
- Wait, where are we?
- We're home.

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:04.180
- But was it a dream or...
- No, not at all!

01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:05.805
Remember?

01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:10.780
That is a machete wound,
poorly stitched by an incompetent doctor.

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:14.521
I'm actually more concerned about tetanus
because the machete had a bit of rust on it,

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:17.564
and I did not see the doctor
give me a shot.

01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:21.140
Duncan, I love you
and I'm so happy you survived,

01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:22.260
but do you hear yourself

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:23.420
- when you say things?
- God.

01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:25.807
- Do you hear the words in your head first?
- And she's back.

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:29.649
I feel like the jock at high school
just gave me his promise ring.

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:53.281
- Doctor, stop.
- Come on.

01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:57.163
- My shift's almost over.
- I have to do my rounds.

01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:59.687
And what beautiful rounds they are.

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:02.323
Oh, my God. Of course.

01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:08.368
Of course, what?

01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:17.481
The sequel!

01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:24.804
This is so great! The sequel is
so much cooler than the original.

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:33.561
Mark.

01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:38.060
Let me just wipe my sweat off
with this tampon.

01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:39.207
Blooper!

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:44.724
How about you go suck a turd?

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.521
That's perfect, so perfectly bad.

01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:52.209
Like that's Bad. Michael Jackson Bad?
That guy's talented.

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:53.810
- King of Pop.
- Yeah.

01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:58.682
Wasn't expecting that.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.420
- No!
- Shit.

01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:09.521
It's broken!

01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:15.766
Oh, God, you killed Duncan.
You smell great, by the way.

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:17.700
You killed him!

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:20.451
I promise I won't tell the cops
if we just go have sex!

01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:22.683
Right now! Now!

01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:29.446
I'm not even scared.

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:34.971
God, Jesus.

01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:37.126
...Chris.

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:38.241
One more time!

01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:43.860
I've only had sex one time
and it was with my cousin Heather!

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:49.205
Honestly, that wasn't your fault,
and I won't tell the cops if we have sex.

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:51.726
Let's...

01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:58.420
Look, Chris,
you and I don't know each other well.

01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:00.522
So, lose the familiarity.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.525
What a rude little girl you're being.

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:08.967
She's not like this at home.
She's just showing off.

01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:11.700
You guys have to learn how to not break.

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:14.167
I'm scared.

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:16.420
I get it, because
you've only had sex with one person

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:19.980
and I'm freaking double-digits slayer
over here.

01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:21.605
You probably don't even know this move.

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:28.885
I feel like I'm walking out like Kramer.

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:31.641
Jerry.

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:37.244
Well, all my bones are broken
except for the one.

01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:42.500
I'm actually talking about this arm.
My penis is severely injured.

01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:44.443
It's like split
in three different parts.

01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:54.780
Okay, okay, people are dying.

01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:56.689
Oh, my God!

01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:02.247
It's not "Ew." It's not "Ew."

01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:05.604
Too sexy? Was it too sexy?

01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:07.965
Impossible.

01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:12.085
Ever since I was a little boy,
I've dreamed of being the final girl.

01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:18.284
I want you to come study.

01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:23.361
One more time.

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:29.684
Well, Vicki, you're a virgin.
No, you're not, you're a slut.

01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:34.481
He had, like, the weird mustache.

01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:41.364
Yeah, right!
A phone that I can put in my mouth?

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:50.601
From the movie.

01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:52.326
Jesus!

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:04.403
All right, see you in there.

01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:13.721
That's a cut!
