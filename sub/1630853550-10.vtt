00:01.610 --> 00:03.307
<i>Previously</i> <i>on</i> Roswell, New Mexico...

00:03.351 --> 00:06.223
You have created a compound that
boosts brain power beyond limit.

00:06.267 --> 00:07.485
Try just a little.

00:07.529 --> 00:09.139
You can save our child.

00:09.183 --> 00:10.575
Even if it was possible

00:10.619 --> 00:11.924
to bring her back,
you would lose yourself.

00:11.968 --> 00:13.056
<i>I would rather lose myself</i>

00:13.100 --> 00:14.362
<i>than my daughter.</i>

00:14.405 --> 00:16.059
All right, look,
whatever your problem is

00:16.103 --> 00:17.930
with me and my father,
it's got nothing to do with her.

00:17.974 --> 00:20.324
She'll pay for what she did
against the cause.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.152
<i>This isn't over.</i><i>Given I now have the means</i>

00:22.196 --> 00:24.328
to finish what my savior
asked to be built.

00:24.372 --> 00:26.374
<i>Jones said once you've gathered</i> <i>all the pieces,</i>

00:26.417 --> 00:29.159
<i>Liz Ortecho</i> <i>will bring the alighting.</i>

00:29.203 --> 00:30.900
Dallas left behind a page
from his dad's Bible.

00:30.943 --> 00:32.423
There were notes in the
margins that led him here.

00:32.467 --> 00:34.947
It's not just quicksand.
There's something behind it.

00:34.991 --> 00:36.906
There's a whole world down
there. I see Alex's pendant.

00:36.949 --> 00:38.342
He's alive down there.
I know it.

00:38.386 --> 00:39.909
It's good to see you, son.
Your journey

00:39.952 --> 00:41.215
is just beginning.

00:45.654 --> 00:47.134
Dallas?

00:48.135 --> 00:50.224
Dallas!

01:31.439 --> 01:32.962
Who's there?

01:33.005 --> 01:35.312
Uh, just a guy
as confused as you are.

01:35.356 --> 01:36.879
Dallas!

01:39.490 --> 01:42.319
Hey. It's good to see you, too.

01:52.982 --> 01:54.505
Hey.

01:55.506 --> 01:56.507
How you feeling?

01:56.551 --> 01:58.466
Motivated.

01:58.509 --> 02:00.424
To do what?

02:00.468 --> 02:02.296
Solve our alien dilemma.

02:02.339 --> 02:03.775
Mm.

02:03.819 --> 02:05.299
I think maybe
we should probably talk

02:05.342 --> 02:07.127
about some of the things
- you said.
- You know,

02:07.170 --> 02:08.824
I don't trust anything
I told myself in a fever dream,

02:08.867 --> 02:10.608
and I don't think you should, either.

02:10.652 --> 02:12.480
I'm here now, right?
And I...

02:13.350 --> 02:15.047
I feel fine.

02:15.091 --> 02:17.876
Well, your shaking hand
says otherwise.

02:21.880 --> 02:23.360
It's a combo platter

02:23.404 --> 02:25.884
of alien and human drugs,
so that's to be expected.

02:25.928 --> 02:27.625
But I appreciate
your concern.

02:27.669 --> 02:30.150
I just... I got to go.

02:30.193 --> 02:31.629
Where you headed?

02:31.673 --> 02:33.153
The sinkhole.

02:33.196 --> 02:36.460
I'm gonna run some tests,
see if I can

02:36.504 --> 02:39.376
figure out why it seems
- to be a one-way door.
- Hey.

02:39.420 --> 02:40.986
Maybe you need to just
slow down for a second.

02:41.030 --> 02:42.988
You know? We almost
died last night.

02:43.032 --> 02:45.165
Okay, so you can see why
I'm eager to not repeat that.

02:50.126 --> 02:52.476
Look,
once we get our friends back

02:52.520 --> 02:55.175
from that hole in the desert,

02:55.218 --> 02:58.090
we can coffee talk
to your heart's content.

03:04.532 --> 03:07.187
What is this place
that we're sitting in?

03:07.230 --> 03:09.319
Well, from what I read
in my dad's Bible,

03:09.363 --> 03:11.756
I think, um...

03:11.800 --> 03:14.237
I think it's a pocket
world that he built.

03:14.281 --> 03:15.717
You know why he built it?

03:15.760 --> 03:17.849
Honestly, I was
hoping that you did.

03:17.893 --> 03:20.852
You know, since Clyde was
looking for his pages, too.

03:20.896 --> 03:24.595
All Clyde said was that Theo,
Nora and Louise hid the way home

03:24.639 --> 03:27.772
and that Theo's Bible was
the key to finding our way free.

03:27.816 --> 03:29.513
So, I'm-I'm hoping

03:29.557 --> 03:32.342
that because we fell
into the entrance that...

03:32.386 --> 03:34.736
that there must be an exit.

03:34.779 --> 03:36.738
Yeah, I think so.

03:36.781 --> 03:39.567
And my dad, he, um,
he left me a message

03:39.610 --> 03:43.875
via a hologram
welcome wagon,

03:43.919 --> 03:46.356
and he said that
I need to travel

03:46.400 --> 03:48.053
to where time stands still.

03:48.097 --> 03:50.099
And once I find
what I seek,

03:50.142 --> 03:53.450
I need to follow the light
to where the sun rises.

03:53.494 --> 03:55.104
Poetic.

03:55.147 --> 03:57.541
Because what we need right now
is a haiku.

03:57.585 --> 03:59.456
Okay, I think
it was a code.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.110
All right? My
dad was worried

04:01.153 --> 04:03.155
about an evil dictator
stealing his instructions.

04:03.199 --> 04:05.593
So, do you think
that he's...

04:05.636 --> 04:08.900
he's leading us to Oasis
or-or back to Earth?

04:08.944 --> 04:11.990
Well, that's the
thing about journeys.

04:12.034 --> 04:15.994
You don't figure out where
they end till you start them.

04:23.045 --> 04:24.655
Hey.

04:24.699 --> 04:26.788
Um... Hey.

04:26.831 --> 04:28.790
I didn't know
that you were coming. I...

04:29.791 --> 04:31.401
Do you want me to leave?

04:31.445 --> 04:33.751
No.
No, I don't.

04:33.795 --> 04:34.970
I...

04:35.884 --> 04:38.103
It's really good to see you.

04:38.147 --> 04:40.454
It's good to see you, too.

04:41.455 --> 04:42.630
We can hug, right?

04:43.631 --> 04:44.936
Yeah. Of course.

04:44.980 --> 04:47.548
- Yeah. Good.
- Come here.

04:49.854 --> 04:52.292
The best part of waking up...

04:52.335 --> 04:53.858
Oh, yeah.

04:53.902 --> 04:56.296
Thank you.

04:56.339 --> 04:58.689
So, Tezca.

04:58.733 --> 05:00.865
Not a bad guy anymore?

05:00.909 --> 05:02.606
No. She never was, apparently.

05:02.650 --> 05:06.349
Yeah, kind of a-a brain in
a blender situation with Jones.

05:06.393 --> 05:09.047
I have her at my studio. I'm
hoping that if I work with her,

05:09.091 --> 05:10.310
we can get her back
to her old self,

05:10.353 --> 05:11.833
maybe we can get
some answers.

05:11.876 --> 05:13.965
But if our alien chameleon
turned white hat,

05:14.009 --> 05:15.967
wouldn't she have given
us the goods by now?

05:16.011 --> 05:17.839
You know it's not quite
that simple, Michael.

05:17.882 --> 05:20.363
Her mind's a little jumbled
between what's reality

05:20.407 --> 05:22.060
and what's
Ophiuchus rewrite.

05:22.104 --> 05:24.236
Uh, but she did tell me
that, um,

05:24.280 --> 05:27.718
Jones commissioned Theo
to design a way home.

05:27.762 --> 05:29.329
A way home how?

05:29.372 --> 05:31.722
Yeah, again,
it is kind of jumbled.

05:31.766 --> 05:35.204
She thinks
that Theo hid his plan

05:35.247 --> 05:37.337
in a "pocket dimension."

05:37.380 --> 05:39.513
Hmm. Okay. Well, maybe

05:39.556 --> 05:42.080
this pocket dimension is
how Maria was sensing Alex.

05:42.124 --> 05:44.909
And since Dallas and Bonnie
are still MIA,

05:44.953 --> 05:46.084
maybe they're in the same place.

05:46.128 --> 05:47.564
Yeah. I'm guessing the way out

05:47.608 --> 05:49.827
is probably hidden
in Theo's coded Bible.

05:49.871 --> 05:51.002
Which Dallas found, yeah?

05:51.046 --> 05:53.831
Yes. Uh,
but then he himself

05:53.875 --> 05:56.660
slipped into
a pocket dimension, so...

05:56.704 --> 05:59.184
That was right before
Clyde burned down the church,

05:59.228 --> 06:01.012
ostensibly covering
his tracks.

06:01.056 --> 06:03.667
Okay, while we're all
making guesses here,

06:03.711 --> 06:06.670
we're thinking that Bible
ended up in Clyde's hands?

06:06.714 --> 06:08.280
If it did,
then it's only a matter of time

06:08.324 --> 06:09.412
before he uses it.

06:09.456 --> 06:10.935
What about you, Doc?

06:12.110 --> 06:14.765
You run across any little
green men while in Careyes?

06:14.809 --> 06:16.419
Did you get probed?

06:16.463 --> 06:20.031
I'm not one to probe and tell.

06:20.075 --> 06:21.293
But...

06:21.337 --> 06:22.730
I did find something.

06:26.255 --> 06:29.084
It's sealed,
but it came with a note.

06:31.260 --> 06:33.697
"Time will tell you
when to join these together."

06:33.741 --> 06:35.438
Does that mean
anything to anyone?

06:38.180 --> 06:40.443
Message doesn't.

06:40.487 --> 06:41.966
But the words do.

06:42.010 --> 06:43.881
It's my mom's handwriting.

06:43.925 --> 06:45.579
You know, Theo and Bronson

06:45.622 --> 06:47.755
divided up
the-the star map to Careyes.

06:47.798 --> 06:49.626
Maybe this has something to do
with the way home.

06:49.670 --> 06:52.803
Yeah. If that way home
is connected to the sinkhole,

06:52.847 --> 06:55.545
I think we could start looking
for answers in there.

06:55.589 --> 06:57.721
- Yeah.
- Get this back to the lair and see?

06:57.765 --> 06:59.070
MAX:Mm-hmm.

06:59.114 --> 07:02.247
I'm gonna, um,
relieve Maria

07:02.291 --> 07:03.335
of, uh, alien-sitting Tezca.

07:08.602 --> 07:10.081
Uh, is Liz laying down?

07:10.125 --> 07:12.170
I brought my bag
to do a quick checkup.

07:12.214 --> 07:15.086
Uh, sounds good, but,
uh, patient is missing.

07:15.130 --> 07:18.133
She said she felt
fine and left,

07:18.176 --> 07:20.004
but, um, I'm worried.

07:20.048 --> 07:22.093
You should be.

07:22.137 --> 07:24.748
I mean,
based on Heath's analysis,

07:24.792 --> 07:28.360
the mist she inhaled could have
some neurological effects.

07:28.404 --> 07:30.841
Like I said, worried.

07:31.842 --> 07:33.061
You two okay?

07:36.891 --> 07:38.370
Look, we've been down

07:38.414 --> 07:40.764
the "Max and Liz
operating independently" road.

07:40.808 --> 07:43.767
People get raised from the dead.
Labs explode.

07:43.811 --> 07:45.334
There's a lot of heartache.

07:45.377 --> 07:46.596
So, my advice?

07:46.640 --> 07:48.859
Just try and get
on the same page, Evans.

07:48.903 --> 07:51.862
Before bad turns to things
I hate getting texts about.

07:58.086 --> 08:01.002
Don't hate me for pushing
you towards greatness.

08:01.045 --> 08:03.134
Pinot and
a PowerPoint presentation--

08:03.178 --> 08:04.658
that might've been
a better sell.

08:06.747 --> 08:08.836
But I'm here now.

08:10.272 --> 08:12.187
And I'm glad.

08:13.188 --> 08:15.364
You got the enhanced cognition?

08:15.407 --> 08:17.627
I'm seeing connections
everywhere I look.

08:17.671 --> 08:19.324
Kick's something awful
at the front,

08:19.368 --> 08:21.501
but I'm guessing you got a taste

08:21.544 --> 08:23.546
of the positive side effects
on the back end?

08:23.590 --> 08:27.289
And now I'm ready to move on
to more important work.

08:28.290 --> 08:29.900
Like curing Nicole?

08:29.944 --> 08:33.774
Like making sure nothing
ever hurts anyone we love again.

08:36.907 --> 08:38.822
So...

08:38.866 --> 08:40.737
where do we start?

08:43.218 --> 08:45.220
Getting more mist.

08:52.140 --> 08:53.707
What's all this about?

08:54.708 --> 08:57.188
You were once my teacher

08:57.232 --> 08:59.364
and a great warrior.

08:59.408 --> 09:01.541
If we can

09:01.584 --> 09:04.848
reconnect your mind
to its state before Jones,

09:04.892 --> 09:07.024
maybe you can
rediscover memories

09:07.068 --> 09:09.070
that can help us defeat Clyde

09:09.113 --> 09:11.463
and reverse the plan
that you set into motion.

09:11.507 --> 09:14.205
If you're the strong fighter
that you claim to be,

09:14.249 --> 09:16.904
you should know
it's foolish to trust me

09:16.947 --> 09:18.601
when I don't even trust myself.

09:18.645 --> 09:21.038
You saw the warrior
that I could be.

09:21.082 --> 09:24.955
I see the warrior
that's waiting to return.

09:31.527 --> 09:33.355
Let's see what you've got.

09:36.488 --> 09:39.666
It's fear that impedes
our ability to fight.

09:41.450 --> 09:43.452
So that's
what we have to master first.

09:50.459 --> 09:51.895
Let's take him down.

10:01.165 --> 10:02.732
<i>So, how'd you find this?</i>

10:02.776 --> 10:05.256
Well, turns out I've got
another secret Valenti relative.

10:05.300 --> 10:07.171
Eduardo's
estranged daughter.

10:07.215 --> 10:10.000
She held some clues as to where
this was hidden in the jungle.

10:10.044 --> 10:12.176
I tried to open it,
but nothing worked on it.

10:17.573 --> 10:19.488
Okay, is this
some space curse?

10:26.974 --> 10:28.323
Oh, my God.

10:28.366 --> 10:30.107
It's the rest
of my console.

10:30.151 --> 10:32.980
I-I think the pieces inside
the box are drawn to it

10:33.023 --> 10:34.546
like some supermagnet.

10:36.897 --> 10:38.986
Where's the rest of it, Valenti?

10:39.029 --> 10:40.640
Don't you mean,
"Thank you for helping me bring

10:40.683 --> 10:42.293
what I've spent two decades
looking for"?

10:42.337 --> 10:43.773
No. I mean, where's
the rest of it?

10:43.817 --> 10:45.122
Because 90% of my console

10:45.166 --> 10:47.124
still pegs it
as an alien paperweight.

10:47.168 --> 10:49.170
Maybe not. Turn around, Guerin.

10:52.826 --> 10:54.218
Has it ever done
that before?

10:54.262 --> 10:56.090
Never.

10:57.091 --> 10:59.310
And I take it

10:59.354 --> 11:03.053
you wouldn't know what that
- flashing symbol means, either?
- No.

11:03.097 --> 11:04.664
But you and I?

11:05.708 --> 11:07.449
We're gonna find out.

11:14.586 --> 11:17.328
So, like, what are we
looking for, exactly?

11:17.372 --> 11:20.984
Dallas has been on a six-month <i>Ancient Aliens</i> bender.

11:21.028 --> 11:22.551
I didn't think his nonsense
would add up to anything,

11:22.594 --> 11:24.814
but he had this cheat sheet

11:24.858 --> 11:27.208
with symbols
and their supposed meanings.

11:28.731 --> 11:30.994
"Sentient Symbology:

11:31.038 --> 11:33.214
The language of
the lesser gods."That's it.

11:36.043 --> 11:37.609
So, according to his work,

11:37.653 --> 11:40.177
the symbol on the console
means "open"

11:40.221 --> 11:41.918
or possibly "death."

11:41.962 --> 11:44.834
Ah. Well, that's a translation
I'd like to not get wrong.

11:44.878 --> 11:47.097
If it means "open,"
maybe it opens the sinkhole.

11:47.141 --> 11:49.273
- That's a leap.
- It's a small one.

11:49.317 --> 11:50.884
The glowing locusts.

11:50.927 --> 11:52.755
They were attracted
to my console.

11:52.799 --> 11:54.626
And the-the weather balloons

11:54.670 --> 11:56.063
that Alex went looking for
before he went missing.

11:56.106 --> 11:57.891
Maybe this thing

11:57.934 --> 12:01.068
makes the door an exit,
not just an entrance.

12:01.111 --> 12:03.766
But what if the symbol
means "death"?

12:03.810 --> 12:07.335
Let's hope it means "open."

12:10.773 --> 12:12.732
Need a hand?

12:12.775 --> 12:14.081
Or a good set of ears?

12:16.083 --> 12:18.389
Yeah. Thank you for coming.

12:18.433 --> 12:19.782
I, um...

12:19.826 --> 12:21.566
I've been at this for a while.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.220
I can't seem
to pick up anything.

12:23.264 --> 12:25.570
I was hoping you and I
could pick up where we left off?

12:25.614 --> 12:28.225
Well, Heath said
that what you're sensing

12:28.269 --> 12:30.793
might be similar
to my abilities.

12:30.837 --> 12:33.883
Everything has a resonant
frequency, right?

12:33.927 --> 12:35.885
And I'm guessing
so does the liminal space

12:35.929 --> 12:37.321
that our friends are stuck in.

12:37.365 --> 12:39.062
Wait, so you're saying
that my new powers

12:39.106 --> 12:41.804
might be picking up frequencies
in other places, too?

12:41.848 --> 12:45.982
Exactly.
And as you tap into the energy

12:46.026 --> 12:48.332
rippling off that...

12:50.944 --> 12:52.597
...you're able
to get glimpses

12:52.641 --> 12:54.904
of our friends who went
all <i>Land of the Lost.</i>

12:54.948 --> 12:57.254
It's something that
the CIA tried to do,

12:57.298 --> 12:59.256
is bend time and space
to spy on their enemies.

12:59.300 --> 13:00.823
They called it remote viewing.

13:00.867 --> 13:03.478
But they didn't have
a real psychic.

13:04.479 --> 13:06.611
Okay, so, how does any of this

13:06.655 --> 13:08.526
help us make contact
with our friends?

13:08.570 --> 13:10.093
Well...

13:10.137 --> 13:12.095
the last time
that you went barefoot

13:12.139 --> 13:13.705
helped us get a signal
from Alex,

13:13.749 --> 13:15.272
so I'm thinking

13:15.316 --> 13:18.101
that you need to try and feel
where they are

13:18.145 --> 13:20.277
not just with your mind
but your body, too.

13:20.321 --> 13:22.366
All right.

13:31.767 --> 13:33.638
And don't just feel
the ripples.

13:33.682 --> 13:35.423
Ride the wave
until you find them.

13:43.431 --> 13:44.998
I saw it.

13:45.041 --> 13:46.651
We have to go
to the Roswell sign.

13:46.695 --> 13:48.131
Okay.

13:48.175 --> 13:50.525
When I had my hands
on the Bible,

13:50.568 --> 13:54.137
I remember reading
that there was a time capsule

13:54.181 --> 13:56.748
that was buried right
here at the Roswell sign.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.707
"Where time stands still."

13:58.750 --> 14:00.187
Cute.

14:03.712 --> 14:06.671
I mean, too bad we don't have
a shovel or something.

14:06.715 --> 14:09.413
You know, for someone
so annoyingly obsessed

14:09.457 --> 14:12.416
with being alien, you barely
lean into the good parts.

14:32.045 --> 14:34.699
Can you open it?

14:34.743 --> 14:37.354
That's weird, there's no,
there's no seams on the box,

14:37.398 --> 14:41.532
or... a lock to break into. Nothing.

14:41.576 --> 14:43.534
Well... well,
maybe we can't unlock it

14:43.578 --> 14:44.927
until we take it back
to where it belongs.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.755
Okay.

14:46.798 --> 14:50.237
Okay, my dad said that light
would lead us to a sunrise.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.892
So maybe we find
a beacon of light?

14:52.935 --> 14:55.633
This one, I-I actually had
a hunch about.

14:55.677 --> 14:57.809
There's an inscription that
says that at our hideout.

14:57.853 --> 14:59.550
Of course.

14:59.594 --> 15:01.117
Lighthouses are beacons
for sailors,

15:01.161 --> 15:02.640
a refuge from danger.

15:02.684 --> 15:04.947
Most people think that
about their church.

15:04.991 --> 15:06.427
Come on.

15:10.431 --> 15:12.824
What's the point
of this exercise?

15:12.868 --> 15:14.957
It's desensitizing therapy.

15:15.001 --> 15:17.568
It's used by
the American military.

15:17.612 --> 15:19.440
We're gonna take down
this space tyrant

15:19.483 --> 15:21.921
until you no longer feel fear.

15:47.163 --> 15:50.123
No matter how many times
Jones pops up,

15:50.166 --> 15:51.907
we will take him down.

15:53.691 --> 15:54.954
You don't have to be afraid
of him anymore.

16:15.931 --> 16:17.889
What is this, Tezca?

16:19.326 --> 16:21.110
Who are they?

16:21.154 --> 16:22.851
It's everyone I hurt.

16:22.894 --> 16:24.592
It's every-- everyone I killed.

16:29.553 --> 16:31.164
Traitor!

16:33.209 --> 16:34.994
You fought Dallas' father.

16:36.908 --> 16:40.477
We-we were allies. Friends.

16:40.521 --> 16:42.566
Until Jones.

16:42.610 --> 16:44.307
And then I turned
on everyone.

16:44.351 --> 16:46.309
Tezca...

16:47.745 --> 16:51.010
You tried. You failed.

16:52.185 --> 16:53.534
Lesson's over.

17:06.068 --> 17:07.200
What are you doing here?

17:18.646 --> 17:20.604
I was collecting
another sample.

17:20.648 --> 17:23.433
What does my pod have
to do with the sinkhole?

17:23.477 --> 17:27.176
Considering at some point these
pods were also impenetrable,

17:27.220 --> 17:30.092
I figured it was worth a look.

17:30.136 --> 17:31.789
Are you checking up on me?

17:31.833 --> 17:33.400
I trust you.

17:33.443 --> 17:35.271
Then let me do what I do.

17:35.315 --> 17:37.447
What I am working on could
save a lot of people's lives.

17:37.491 --> 17:39.058
I don't have time for you
to be second-guessing me.

17:39.101 --> 17:41.712
I'm just trying to help you.

17:41.756 --> 17:44.063
Do you understand
the relativistic dynamics

17:44.106 --> 17:45.890
of Hawking's radiation?

17:45.934 --> 17:49.720
Can you convert constrained
Lagrange multipliers?

17:49.764 --> 17:53.898
I have to talk science with
someone who speaks my language.

17:53.942 --> 17:55.204
Like Shivani.

17:55.248 --> 17:57.772
Shivani who almost
killed you?

17:59.948 --> 18:01.167
Accidents happen.

18:02.777 --> 18:04.866
Darwin called it evolution.

18:06.259 --> 18:08.652
I want to build a life
with you, Max.

18:08.696 --> 18:10.785
You gotta know that.

18:10.828 --> 18:13.701
So get out of my way so I can
go and make that possible.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.236
Okay.

18:27.280 --> 18:28.759
This frog's nucleating proteins

18:28.803 --> 18:30.935
ensure the water in its blood
freezes first.

18:30.979 --> 18:33.416
So the cells shrink, and
it enters suspended animation.

18:33.460 --> 18:35.157
An earthbound way
of replicating

18:35.201 --> 18:36.289
what those alien pods do.

18:36.332 --> 18:37.594
Exactly.

18:37.638 --> 18:39.248
But our Kermit here
is freshly dead,

18:39.292 --> 18:40.945
so I have an electrical current
that's pulsing through him.

18:40.989 --> 18:42.338
Same as you have to
with Nicole.

18:42.382 --> 18:45.298
And it's gonna stimulate
and simulate stasis.

18:45.341 --> 18:47.430
But with the right
chemical combo,

18:47.474 --> 18:49.302
we'll breathe new life
into those waiting cells.

18:49.345 --> 18:51.478
I'll mix it up.

18:56.483 --> 18:59.138
You think we're
moving too fast?

18:59.181 --> 19:01.052
'Cause I saw Max in
the cave, and he...

19:01.096 --> 19:03.664
He doesn't see that you're
trying to protect him, right?

19:05.361 --> 19:07.146
That's why he needs
your protection.

19:08.538 --> 19:10.453
If he got this worked up
over you trying to steal

19:10.497 --> 19:13.152
a few egg whites
from his nest,

19:13.195 --> 19:15.850
he couldn't possibly understand
what we're trying to do.

19:30.038 --> 19:32.475
There's a heartbeat.

19:32.519 --> 19:35.478
I-I-It's weak, arhythmic,
but it's there.

19:38.264 --> 19:39.787
We did it.

19:41.049 --> 19:43.704
I'll have my team
get Nicole ready.

19:43.747 --> 19:45.314
No. No, no, no. No.

19:45.358 --> 19:48.230
Not yet. Humans are
a whole different animal.

19:48.274 --> 19:49.840
Okay? We have to
run more tests.

19:49.884 --> 19:51.494
I have to compare
Kermit's cells with Rosa's,

19:51.538 --> 19:53.235
and check for
abnormal apoptosis

19:53.279 --> 19:54.758
- and cellular degradation.
- Uh-huh.

19:54.802 --> 19:56.369
We just finished
the last of her blood.

19:57.718 --> 19:59.285
She was my sister.
There's always more blood.

20:05.726 --> 20:06.944
Ha.

20:06.988 --> 20:10.121
"Welcome all to this
house of light."

20:10.165 --> 20:11.688
Bonnie, good work.

20:11.732 --> 20:13.951
Well, this was a house
of light.

20:13.995 --> 20:15.692
Then my Triad found it.

20:15.736 --> 20:18.217
Everything that walks
through these doors is broken.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.219
The goal is just

20:20.262 --> 20:22.046
walk out more mended
than you came in.

20:22.090 --> 20:24.092
Yeah, that's what
this planet is to me.

20:24.135 --> 20:26.573
On Oasis, I'm a...

20:26.616 --> 20:28.488
I'm a threat
to the ones I love.

20:30.403 --> 20:33.362
A weapon designed to rob people
of their very identities.

20:33.406 --> 20:35.712
That's all
I've ever been.

20:35.756 --> 20:36.800
A taker.

20:36.844 --> 20:39.238
But not on Earth.

20:39.281 --> 20:41.631
Well,
humans don't have powers

20:41.675 --> 20:43.242
that I can steal.

20:43.285 --> 20:46.767
Earth was the first place
that I finally felt free.

20:46.810 --> 20:48.856
Now I might not ever
get back there.

20:50.510 --> 20:53.077
Hey, I, um...

20:53.121 --> 20:54.470
I think you're wrong.

20:54.514 --> 20:56.820
You're not just a taker,

20:56.864 --> 20:59.127
which is how you've been
taught to see yourself.

20:59.170 --> 21:01.999
You want to know
what I see?

21:02.043 --> 21:03.392
Potential.

21:03.436 --> 21:05.568
Potential to give.

21:05.612 --> 21:08.876
It's just up to you
to make it true.

21:14.142 --> 21:16.797
Uh... I remembered something.

21:17.798 --> 21:20.148
What is it?

21:20.191 --> 21:23.151
Bonnie. Bonnie!
I-I think I found something.

21:24.805 --> 21:25.936
What is this?

21:25.980 --> 21:29.288
It's light. The light.

21:40.516 --> 21:43.432
♪ This little light of mine

21:43.476 --> 21:46.435
♪ I'm gonna let it shine

21:46.479 --> 21:47.523
♪ This little light of mine...

21:47.567 --> 21:49.133
Your father left us a map.

21:49.177 --> 21:51.179
♪ I'm gonna let it shine

21:51.222 --> 21:54.051
♪ This little light of mine

21:54.095 --> 21:56.315
♪ I'm gonna let it shine

21:56.358 --> 21:58.969
♪ Let it shine, let it shine

21:59.013 --> 22:01.363
♪ Let it shine...

22:01.407 --> 22:04.975
Better yet, I think I know
where this symbol leads.

22:05.019 --> 22:06.629
♪ I'm gonna let it shine

22:06.673 --> 22:09.676
♪ Let it shine, let it shine,
let it shine. ♪

22:14.681 --> 22:15.986
I-I felt it before.

22:16.030 --> 22:17.248
I don't know why
I'm not getting anything.

22:17.292 --> 22:18.815
Look, getting command
of my abilities

22:18.859 --> 22:20.556
came in fits and starts, too.

22:22.036 --> 22:23.298
Use the Force?

22:25.082 --> 22:26.736
Pick whatever
metaphor you want,

22:26.780 --> 22:31.262
but stop looking for it,
and let your brain look for it.

22:36.267 --> 22:37.747
Remember, everything is vibrating.

22:37.791 --> 22:41.577
The sand, the liminal space, us.

22:41.621 --> 22:43.274
Remember what it felt like,

22:43.318 --> 22:45.538
and settle into
that frequency.

22:51.326 --> 22:52.371
What, did you get something?

22:52.414 --> 22:54.416
Yeah.

22:54.460 --> 22:58.377
Hey, Liz just sent me
an SOS text.

22:58.420 --> 22:59.943
All right, you handle that.

22:59.987 --> 23:01.423
Your work is done here,
Professor McGonagall.

23:01.467 --> 23:02.903
I got this.

23:07.298 --> 23:08.909
Nothing's working
on this console.

23:08.952 --> 23:11.041
We are still stuck on
the E.T. equivalent

23:11.085 --> 23:12.956
of "internal server error."

23:13.000 --> 23:15.568
Okay, look, I know the rope
covered in silver didn't work,

23:15.611 --> 23:17.700
but Dallas left behind some
notes that could be useful.

23:17.744 --> 23:19.876
Look, what if we just tried
dropping something else in?

23:19.920 --> 23:22.313
Just forget it, Valenti.

23:22.357 --> 23:26.405
Everything goes in,
nothing comes out.

23:26.448 --> 23:27.623
Just like Alex.

23:27.667 --> 23:29.451
We'll find him.

23:29.495 --> 23:31.627
You want to tell me how?

23:31.671 --> 23:33.107
'Cause I think
this is useless.

23:34.108 --> 23:35.544
After all these years,

23:35.588 --> 23:37.328
after everything Alex
and I have been through,

23:37.372 --> 23:39.156
our love is losing out
to a hole in the ground.

23:39.200 --> 23:42.725
Listen, I know what it means
to yearn for something

23:42.769 --> 23:44.423
that's always just
out of reach.

23:46.337 --> 23:49.906
I'm sure whatever girl
you're trying to reach for

23:49.950 --> 23:51.734
just needs you to reach
a little further.

23:51.778 --> 23:56.217
The truth is...
she just didn't reach back.

24:00.613 --> 24:02.963
But you know who's
reaching back? Alex.

24:03.006 --> 24:04.443
To you.

24:04.486 --> 24:05.922
Now, he's out there somewhere

24:05.966 --> 24:08.098
doing his damnedest
to reach you through Maria.

24:08.142 --> 24:09.752
Every bit as determined
to be with you

24:09.796 --> 24:11.275
as you are with him.

24:11.319 --> 24:13.452
That's powerful.

24:13.495 --> 24:15.671
So the minute
you want to start

24:15.715 --> 24:19.762
giving up the faith,
I'll keep it...

24:19.806 --> 24:21.242
for the both of you.

24:25.333 --> 24:27.814
I hate it when you are right.

24:28.989 --> 24:30.338
Can you please bring me

24:30.381 --> 24:31.774
the notebook of
crazy ideas, Valenti?

24:31.818 --> 24:33.863
We're trying something else.

24:33.907 --> 24:35.865
Okay.

24:40.261 --> 24:42.306
An SOS text to draw my blood?

24:43.743 --> 24:44.787
Beginning to think that
you're a vampire.

24:44.831 --> 24:46.485
There's too much blue.

24:46.528 --> 24:47.834
In my veins?

24:47.877 --> 24:50.663
No, in-in your painting.
It's distracting.

24:50.706 --> 24:53.143
It's... Composition is off.
How do you not see that?

24:53.187 --> 24:54.493
Well, it's not
a paint by numbers.

24:54.536 --> 24:56.495
It's an expression of
my inner self.

24:56.538 --> 24:58.148
Well, your inner self needs
to get a better handle

24:58.192 --> 24:59.802
on symmetry and color balance.

25:01.195 --> 25:02.675
Hey, what do you need
this for anyway?

25:02.718 --> 25:04.328
It's too complicated
to explain.

25:04.372 --> 25:05.895
Well, that doesn't answer
my question.

25:05.939 --> 25:07.506
I'm working on something.

25:07.549 --> 25:09.508
I need your blood
to check my work.

25:09.551 --> 25:11.379
Okay?

25:13.729 --> 25:15.035
You're taking the mist?

25:18.386 --> 25:20.649
It's fine. Side effects from
last night's medical saga.

25:20.693 --> 25:22.346
Yeah, right.

25:22.390 --> 25:23.826
Irritability,
intense alertness.

25:23.870 --> 25:25.349
Liz, I know the signs
of substance abuse.

25:25.393 --> 25:27.264
I'm not the junkie
in the family, Rosa,

25:27.308 --> 25:29.179
so stop projecting
your addiction onto me

25:29.223 --> 25:30.572
because you still crave it.

25:30.616 --> 25:32.705
Of course I do.
Okay? Everybody does,

25:32.748 --> 25:34.445
but I'm two years sober.

25:34.489 --> 25:35.969
You mean you're worried about
falling off the wagon?

25:37.100 --> 25:40.190
My Rosita, just because
you struggle with self-control

25:40.234 --> 25:42.715
does not mean I do, too.

25:51.332 --> 25:53.247
We should go a little
slower next time.

25:54.727 --> 25:56.642
I'm too far gone
to be fixed.

26:01.429 --> 26:03.213
You know, when I was younger,
I didn't have a very strong

26:03.257 --> 26:04.475
sense of self.

26:06.652 --> 26:10.960
So when I got married,
my husband became...

26:11.004 --> 26:12.745
my source of strength.

26:12.788 --> 26:14.921
He knew that I was weak.

26:14.964 --> 26:17.619
He took control
of my mind.

26:17.663 --> 26:21.928
And he used me
to murder three young women.

26:23.103 --> 26:25.279
You killed three people.

26:27.368 --> 26:29.500
I killed dozens.

26:29.544 --> 26:31.154
That was by Jones' hand.

26:31.198 --> 26:33.243
The sword was in
my hand, Isobel.

26:33.287 --> 26:35.506
You can make amends.

26:37.030 --> 26:37.987
And I can help you.

26:38.031 --> 26:40.076
You want to help?

26:40.120 --> 26:41.512
Give me back my memories.

26:41.556 --> 26:43.166
They're false memories.

26:43.210 --> 26:46.256
With them, at least
I could cope.

26:46.300 --> 26:48.432
But now you've taken away
the one thing

26:48.476 --> 26:51.131
that made my life bearable.

26:53.394 --> 26:56.353
Your forgetting isn't going
to change what happened.

26:56.397 --> 26:59.661
I know I don't have
to tell you that.

26:59.705 --> 27:02.969
In order to heal,

27:03.012 --> 27:06.799
you have to acknowledge
what happened in the past.

27:09.497 --> 27:11.194
And then what?

27:11.238 --> 27:14.154
When I found out what
my husband had done to me,

27:14.197 --> 27:15.764
my world was shattered.

27:15.808 --> 27:19.812
I had to fight like hell
to become the woman

27:19.855 --> 27:21.552
that I wanted to be.

27:21.596 --> 27:25.295
I know who you were...

27:25.339 --> 27:27.384
before Jones corrupted
your mind,

27:27.428 --> 27:31.519
but who you want
to be tomorrow...

27:34.696 --> 27:37.046
...that's entirely up to you.

27:42.878 --> 27:45.141
The first thing I do
when I get back to Earth

27:45.185 --> 27:48.057
is eat one of those... those
birds inside another bird

27:48.101 --> 27:49.711
that's-that's inside
another bird.

27:49.755 --> 27:50.973
You know?
What is that called?

27:51.017 --> 27:52.845
Uh, turducken?

27:56.457 --> 27:58.807
Is this another clue
on the way to

27:58.851 --> 28:00.330
"X" marks the spot?

28:00.374 --> 28:03.203
No. No, I think
this is the "X"

28:03.246 --> 28:05.727
that my dad
wanted me to find.

28:05.771 --> 28:07.686
What is it?

28:07.729 --> 28:10.297
I think this is a portal.

28:21.395 --> 28:23.310
I wonder what
this thing does.

28:26.226 --> 28:28.750
Whoa, I...

28:28.794 --> 28:30.752
I think the box is moving.

28:39.108 --> 28:40.544
What is that?

28:40.588 --> 28:42.851
Michael recovered part
of Nora's console.

28:42.895 --> 28:45.419
I mean, this... This looks like
it's another piece.

28:45.462 --> 28:48.248
And it seems like
the entire console would fit

28:48.291 --> 28:50.119
right here in this spot.

28:51.773 --> 28:53.732
Yeah, this... this indenture,
it should hold the star map.

28:53.775 --> 28:55.211
Okay, Michael always thought

28:55.255 --> 28:56.952
that it controlled
some kind of ship.

28:56.996 --> 28:59.041
I always thought Clyde and
Tezca were looking for one,

28:59.085 --> 29:00.913
but-but this must
control the gateway.

29:00.956 --> 29:02.436
Okay, Michael said that
the star map had

29:02.479 --> 29:04.046
hundreds of planets on it.

29:04.090 --> 29:06.788
So maybe this could go
to all of them, including Oasis.

29:06.832 --> 29:09.791
Okay, but how do we
find our way there?

29:09.835 --> 29:12.881
I don't know.

29:12.925 --> 29:16.276
My dad referenced
a sunrise in his clue, so...

29:16.319 --> 29:18.104
I guess we have to find
some kind of way

29:18.147 --> 29:19.366
to trigger that somehow?

29:27.026 --> 29:28.941
Well, it looks like
I'm close.

29:40.300 --> 29:41.997
The ripples...

29:43.825 --> 29:44.957
Waves to read.

29:53.487 --> 29:57.665
Okay, there is
something weird here.

30:01.321 --> 30:02.975
Oh, my God.

30:06.021 --> 30:07.936
Hey.
Hey.

30:07.980 --> 30:09.982
I, um, I got your text.

30:10.025 --> 30:13.289
Um, I'm guessing
you didn't want to meet up

30:13.333 --> 30:15.509
just to split a plate of
NASA-chos.

30:15.552 --> 30:18.555
Liz was just here, and she was
all Hyde, no Jekyll.

30:19.905 --> 30:20.949
Okay.

30:20.993 --> 30:22.168
Did you know that she's still

30:22.211 --> 30:23.386
huffing alien whippets?

30:26.781 --> 30:29.305
She's acting like an addict.
I would know.

30:29.349 --> 30:31.003
It was like looking
into a mirror.

30:31.046 --> 30:34.484
The mist is acting
like a narcotic,

30:34.528 --> 30:36.922
and it'll wreck her life
to sustain itself.

30:38.706 --> 30:41.143
Let me talk to her.

30:41.187 --> 30:43.450
She said she was doing this
out of love for me.

30:45.408 --> 30:48.020
Maybe I can break through.

30:53.460 --> 30:56.071
You're right.

30:56.115 --> 30:58.465
A warrior can only fight
what's in front of them.

31:00.075 --> 31:01.903
So I'll atone
for my sins

31:01.947 --> 31:04.384
through the children
of those I hurt.

31:08.127 --> 31:09.780
I was a confidant

31:09.824 --> 31:13.393
of the ones you called Nora,
Louise and Theo.

31:15.221 --> 31:16.700
A go-between passing

31:16.744 --> 31:19.703
scientific plans amongst them.

31:19.747 --> 31:23.533
When I saw Theo,
I was reminded of something

31:23.577 --> 31:25.927
I'd hoped never
to think about again.

31:29.626 --> 31:30.889
Show me.

31:38.461 --> 31:39.941
Another one of your
fanciful inventions

31:39.985 --> 31:41.421
to save our planet?

31:41.464 --> 31:43.902
Perhaps it's time
we change our perception of home

31:43.945 --> 31:45.773
and look beyond the stars.

31:45.816 --> 31:48.819
This is a method
or transportation?

31:48.863 --> 31:50.256
One that can link
our world to others

31:50.299 --> 31:51.910
across vast galaxies.

31:53.259 --> 31:54.564
It's just a prototype.

31:54.608 --> 31:56.915
And there needs to be
a second elsewhere

31:56.958 --> 31:58.829
in order to
establish a bridge.

31:58.873 --> 32:02.442
You know what will happen
if the dictator finds out

32:02.485 --> 32:04.226
such technology exists.

32:04.270 --> 32:06.794
Which is why I've already
thought ahead, my dear friend.

32:08.970 --> 32:11.277
I'm thinking about a lock
that will prevent him

32:11.320 --> 32:13.453
and his followers
from ever using it.

32:18.110 --> 32:20.068
That's what Jones wanted
from Liz.

32:20.112 --> 32:22.418
He thought that she
could pick that lock.

32:22.462 --> 32:24.246
There was a time when
I would have burned down

32:24.290 --> 32:25.944
this entire planet

32:25.987 --> 32:27.336
to fulfill Ophiuchus' will.

32:27.380 --> 32:31.166
Clyde, he's a true believer.

32:31.210 --> 32:32.515
He didn't need
his precious savior

32:32.559 --> 32:34.865
to warp his mind into obeying.

32:37.303 --> 32:39.435
Okay, I think I got an idea.

32:39.479 --> 32:40.436
You think you can
open this thing

32:40.480 --> 32:41.611
with just that piece?

32:41.655 --> 32:43.613
No, but Guerin always said that

32:43.657 --> 32:45.964
the pieces want to be together.

32:46.007 --> 32:48.923
Maybe we can exploit
that connection.

32:54.015 --> 32:55.625
Guerin!

32:55.669 --> 32:57.627
Your console is...

32:57.671 --> 32:59.455
consoling.

32:59.499 --> 33:00.804
Did you touch it?

33:00.848 --> 33:02.110
No, no, no, it just
started doing

33:02.154 --> 33:04.721
this crazy light show
on its own.

33:09.074 --> 33:10.205
What was that?

33:10.249 --> 33:11.990
I don't know.

33:12.033 --> 33:14.122
There's only one way to prove
it's not a coincidence.

33:17.430 --> 33:19.171
Holy <i>Close Encounters.</i>

33:27.962 --> 33:29.398
What are you doing?

33:29.442 --> 33:32.097
Praying to God that
this message is received.

33:34.273 --> 33:37.015
I mean... is it a pattern?

33:37.058 --> 33:40.148
It's better than that, Valenti.
It's Morse code.

33:40.192 --> 33:42.672
It's a way to talk
with hits and spaces.

33:42.716 --> 33:45.545
I-I learned it at summer camp.

33:47.373 --> 33:49.810
What is the flashing saying?

33:52.117 --> 33:55.729
"Are... you...

33:57.470 --> 33:58.949
...Alex?"

34:00.429 --> 34:03.258
Is that Manes?

34:03.302 --> 34:06.566
No. But it is
Bonnie and Dallas.

34:06.609 --> 34:08.959
Okay, well, that's
still progress.

34:09.003 --> 34:10.309
Ask them where they are.

34:24.149 --> 34:25.237
They aren't sure.

34:29.937 --> 34:31.112
Find anything?

34:31.156 --> 34:34.376
Literally? No, but

34:34.420 --> 34:37.075
I am giving Dr. Strange
a run for his money.

34:37.118 --> 34:39.294
Strange could categorize
things over here, too.

34:39.338 --> 34:40.469
Can we talk shop later?

34:40.513 --> 34:41.731
Please tell us

34:41.775 --> 34:43.081
that you got new information

34:43.124 --> 34:44.212
on where our lost friends are.

34:44.256 --> 34:45.735
You're gonna have to come

34:45.779 --> 34:47.607
stand with me to believe it.

34:48.869 --> 34:51.872
And, Guerin,
bring your console.

35:01.360 --> 35:03.753
I don't make you mediocre,

35:03.797 --> 35:05.190
and I would never
hold you back.

35:07.148 --> 35:09.629
Our conversation
in your mind.

35:09.672 --> 35:12.762
Blaming me for something
that I said in a fever dream.

35:12.806 --> 35:14.329
I'm not interested
in the lie.

35:15.852 --> 35:18.116
Who really won that standoff?

35:22.163 --> 35:24.165
The one who can make
the hard choices.

35:24.209 --> 35:26.124
Do you?
'Cause taking that stuff

35:26.167 --> 35:28.256
isn't a hard choice.

35:28.300 --> 35:29.649
It's giving in to fear.

35:29.692 --> 35:31.781
I'm here to help you stop.

35:31.825 --> 35:34.436
Okay? All I've ever wanted is to
be the man behind Liz Ortecho.

35:34.480 --> 35:37.135
And I am out there
fighting for us

35:37.178 --> 35:40.181
the only way I know how:

35:40.225 --> 35:42.183
conquering the science.

35:42.227 --> 35:45.491
And I've done it, Max.
I built this drug,

35:45.534 --> 35:46.492
and it is currently supercharging

35:46.535 --> 35:48.146
my neurosynapses.

35:48.189 --> 35:49.712
I mean, look at this guy.

35:49.756 --> 35:51.888
A few hours ago,
he was dead.

35:51.932 --> 35:54.021
Look at him now.

35:54.064 --> 35:56.545
That is unethical.

35:56.589 --> 35:59.331
So it's only okay
when you do it?

36:01.246 --> 36:03.639
You used to be able
to heal people

36:03.683 --> 36:06.468
with just a touch of a hand,
and you gave that up.

36:06.512 --> 36:08.078
Because it literally
killed me.

36:08.122 --> 36:10.690
No, you rejected learning
about the blue flame,

36:10.733 --> 36:13.214
which could have shed light
on how your healing works.

36:13.258 --> 36:14.650
You were scared.

36:14.694 --> 36:15.912
And then you bailed.

36:15.956 --> 36:17.305
So now I am sitting here

36:17.349 --> 36:19.655
trying to do what you do;
I am evolving.

36:19.699 --> 36:22.049
I didn't bail.
I accepted my limitations.

36:22.092 --> 36:23.529
Now, why can't you accept yours?

36:23.572 --> 36:25.531
Maybe you're my limit.

36:30.362 --> 36:31.711
I love you, Max.

36:33.582 --> 36:36.237
But I need to take
the next steps on my own.

36:41.547 --> 36:46.029
Well, that frog
you resurrected...

36:46.073 --> 36:47.074
it's dead.

36:52.775 --> 36:56.126
I'm sorry, but
- the frog is dead.
- What?

36:56.170 --> 36:58.259
We didn't cure death.

36:59.782 --> 37:00.783
Yet.

37:00.827 --> 37:02.394
No, I've looked at this

37:02.437 --> 37:03.438
from every angle.

37:03.482 --> 37:04.787
Then let's take some more mist

37:04.831 --> 37:06.398
and discover new angles.

37:06.441 --> 37:08.051
There are some things
science can't do, Shivani.

37:08.095 --> 37:09.270
This is one of them.

37:09.314 --> 37:11.620
No, there must be a way... There isn't.

37:12.665 --> 37:14.623
And all the time
we waste trying

37:14.667 --> 37:16.277
is better spent on
a hundred other things

37:16.321 --> 37:18.888
because there are children
just like Nicole dying,

37:18.932 --> 37:21.761
whose illnesses we could
eradicate using the mist.

37:21.804 --> 37:23.589
Those children aren't
my daughter.

37:26.287 --> 37:27.549
Yeah, I admired you.

37:27.593 --> 37:30.160
Your strength,
your determination

37:30.204 --> 37:32.119
to accomplish the impossible,

37:32.162 --> 37:33.555
but now I see that
your singular focus

37:33.599 --> 37:36.254
is not your strength,
it is your weakness.

37:36.297 --> 37:38.647
I thought we both knew
what it was like

37:38.691 --> 37:40.562
to lose someone we love.

37:40.606 --> 37:43.565
I'm sorry, I'm done with
emotional ties.

37:43.609 --> 37:45.785
That is my weakness.

37:45.828 --> 37:48.309
Without the distraction of Max,

37:48.353 --> 37:50.311
nothing is holding me back.

37:50.355 --> 37:53.445
From what?

37:53.488 --> 37:55.838
What matters more than
the life of my daughter?

37:58.363 --> 38:00.843
I'm sorry, Shivani.

38:00.887 --> 38:02.932
Partnerships only work when
we're both on the same path,

38:02.976 --> 38:04.499
and we're clearly
at a crossroads.

38:06.806 --> 38:08.503
Good luck.

38:18.557 --> 38:22.474
- Hey, Isobel.
- Hey. Uh...

38:24.258 --> 38:25.999
Oh, boy.

38:26.042 --> 38:27.957
We have to talk to you
about Liz.

38:28.001 --> 38:30.482
You know that alien mist?
She's still taking it.

38:32.266 --> 38:34.486
And we're gonna need all hands
on deck to pull her out.

38:34.529 --> 38:35.922
Especially mine.

38:37.271 --> 38:40.361
I'm hoping you can help me
get my powers back.

38:45.888 --> 38:49.152
I can't believe it.

38:49.196 --> 38:50.545
Shaped just like my console.

38:50.589 --> 38:52.852
Minus the missing piece.

38:54.244 --> 38:55.507
We'll find it.

38:57.509 --> 38:58.727
Just like I'll find Alex.

39:00.555 --> 39:03.689
Thanks for helping me put my
pieces together today, Valenti.

39:03.732 --> 39:06.648
I hope you find ways
to connect the ones

39:06.692 --> 39:07.867
that don't fit just yet.

39:09.303 --> 39:10.348
Hey!

39:11.914 --> 39:13.220
We doing this or what?

39:22.534 --> 39:24.623
Dallas, look.

39:40.334 --> 39:44.120

39:52.825 --> 39:55.218

39:57.090 --> 39:58.613
That's Earth.

39:58.657 --> 40:00.833
Wait, I thought the portal
just went to Oasis.

40:02.269 --> 40:05.228
I bet the star map controls
where it goes.

40:05.272 --> 40:06.316
Without it,
it's probably preset

40:06.360 --> 40:07.405
to go to only one place.

40:11.757 --> 40:13.715

- Are you sure?

40:29.514 --> 40:31.341
What if you can't get back?

40:31.385 --> 40:33.561
Clyde burned down the only
alien tree we know of on Earth.

40:33.605 --> 40:35.998

I'm not letting it go.

the way my father couldn't.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.105
Listen, I don't know where
this alien brick road

40:56.149 --> 40:57.803
might take us next,

40:57.846 --> 40:59.892
but this might be your last
chance to get back to Earth.

41:03.199 --> 41:04.505
I'm more than just a taker.
