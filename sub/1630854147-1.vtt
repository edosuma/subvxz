16:45.125 --> 16:46.500
Vee, look at me.

You know when you were asking
about Daddy earlier?

[wind whistling]

16:56.458 --> 16:59.000
Well, um… [sighs]

17:00.541 --> 17:02.541
Baby, he, um…

17:05.000 --> 17:06.208
[sighs]

17:07.375 --> 17:09.875
He loves you so much.

17:11.416 --> 17:14.041
And he thinks about you all the time.

17:18.708 --> 17:20.041
Um…

17:20.125 --> 17:21.500
What are we making?

17:22.083 --> 17:23.791
-Friendship bracelets.
-Oh.

17:23.875 --> 17:25.625
I wanna make a friendship bracelet.

17:25.708 --> 17:27.166
This one is for Lou.

17:27.250 --> 17:29.208
You're making a bracelet for Lou? Why?

17:29.916 --> 17:30.791
I like Lou.

17:31.666 --> 17:33.750
-I know you don't.
-Yeah, I do.

17:34.708 --> 17:35.750
[chuckles]

17:36.750 --> 17:38.791
Okay. I actually don't like Lou.

17:38.875 --> 17:40.958
But why do you like her?

17:41.041 --> 17:43.875
Well, Jax likes her, and I like Jax.

17:43.958 --> 17:44.875
[mom] Oh.

so I'll keep this short."

17:57.458 --> 18:00.125
"The house is yours. Sell it."

18:00.208 --> 18:04.208
"There's a month's worth of meat for Jax
in the freezer, and some cash for you."

18:05.958 --> 18:10.000
"There are certain decisions I made
that you will never understand."

18:12.458 --> 18:14.708
"But that's all in the past now."

18:16.166 --> 18:17.541
"Life can be cruel."

18:18.041 --> 18:21.250
"What made me great at some things
made me lousy at others."

18:25.708 --> 18:29.333
"I wish I could say
that some good came from what I did."

18:30.250 --> 18:31.208

18:32.375 --> 18:34.666
I left the world a more dangerous place."

-I'm exhausted. Come on, Mr. Hippo.

18:56.625 --> 18:58.416
-Good night.
-I'm hot.

18:58.500 --> 19:02.083

Don't be scared.

19:08.666 --> 19:10.875
-I'm not scared.
-Okay.

19:10.958 --> 19:14.541
-Are you scared?
-Do you wanna sleep with me tonight?

19:14.625 --> 19:17.208
-Oh, if you need me to, I will.
-I think I do.

19:19.958 --> 19:21.291

I'm just gonna go flip the breaker.

23:05.041 --> 23:08.291
-[gasps] Vee's gone.
-What, you let her wander off again?

23:08.375 --> 23:10.500
-She's not gonna get far in this.
-No, no, no.

He's… he's here. How the hell is he here?

Hold on. You saw him?

23:18.375 --> 23:20.333
No. I…

23:20.416 --> 23:23.375
He… he's supposed to be dead,
but he found us.

A bomb?
It means he's been plannin' this, Lou.

24:48.875 --> 24:51.208
We gotta get more help.
We need to get to the sheriff.

24:51.291 --> 24:53.541
Can't get to him.
No cars. Phones are down.

24:53.625 --> 24:55.041
We're ten miles outside of town.

-What?

25:00.333 --> 25:01.541
Track 'em? You?

25:01.625 --> 25:03.291
[Lou] Get batteries. Kitchen.

25:09.458 --> 25:12.416
You don't understand.
Philip was a Green Beret.

25:12.500 --> 25:15.875
Wanted for some terrible shit
that he did in Central America.

25:16.458 --> 25:18.041
War crimes kind of shit.

25:18.125 --> 25:21.458
I saw the court transcripts.
He was torturing hostages for fun.

25:22.041 --> 25:26.083
He's highly trained. An explosives expert.
Well, we're no match for him, Lou.

25:26.791 --> 25:30.541
We need professional help.
You and the dog ain't gonna cut it.

25:33.250 --> 25:35.166
Did he take anything from your trailer?

25:36.833 --> 25:38.958
[mother]
Her-- her favorite stuffy, Mr. Hippo.

25:39.041 --> 25:41.500
-And a-- a blanket.
-He wants her comfortable.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.333
He wants her quiet.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.375
Renovations.

25:55.750 --> 25:57.750
[wind whistling]

26:01.541 --> 26:04.416
When they tried to arrest him,
he blew his apartment up.

26:04.500 --> 26:07.875
They sent a death certificate.
How the hell could he still be alive?

26:07.958 --> 26:09.208
[barking]

26:10.916 --> 26:13.125
[Lou] Halothane. Sleeping gas.

26:13.708 --> 26:15.583
You're lucky it didn't knock you out.

26:26.375 --> 26:28.583
[Lou] He's pullin' her in somethin'.

26:28.666 --> 26:31.750
If he gets her off the island,
this will get a lot messier.

26:31.833 --> 26:33.666
Airport and ferry are closed.

26:38.708 --> 26:40.791
Private vessel. He's headed to the coast.

26:40.875 --> 26:43.125
He's got a head start. I gotta move fast.

26:43.208 --> 26:45.833
Stay here.
The storm clears, head into town.

26:45.916 --> 26:48.000
First house you see, call the sheriff.

26:51.708 --> 26:54.083
-Hey, where are you goin'?
-To find my child.

26:54.166 --> 26:56.000
You don't know what you're doing.

27:01.750 --> 27:04.583
If you slow me down,
I will leave you behind.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Maybe this'll jog your memory.

Here's the church…

28:28.000 --> 28:29.500
Here's the steeple…

28:34.250 --> 28:35.125
It's you.

28:36.166 --> 28:37.916
Yes, it is. It's-- it's me.

28:38.916 --> 28:40.083
It's me, sweetie.

28:43.250 --> 28:45.000
You came back from your adventure.

28:48.083 --> 28:49.208
I sure did.

28:50.791 --> 28:52.833
And… and I even brought you a present.

28:56.041 --> 28:57.583
Is it part of the treasure?

28:58.291 --> 29:00.041
Uh, treasure? Yeah!

29:00.750 --> 29:02.250
Yeah, it sure is.

29:02.333 --> 29:06.916
And… you and I are gonna go
on our own adventure together.

Is she coming with us?

29:12.625 --> 29:15.000
Yeah, of course she is. Of course she is.

29:15.875 --> 29:19.458
I left her a note
and some clues to follow us,

29:20.041 --> 29:22.208
and she's gonna
meet up with us after, okay?

29:26.750 --> 29:28.000
Uh-- Whoa.

52:58.458 --> 52:59.750
[Hannah gasps]

53:04.125 --> 53:05.250
[gasping]

53:11.166 --> 53:12.333
Oh!

53:16.708 --> 53:17.583
[Lou] Shit.

53:17.666 --> 53:19.625
[groans] Jesus.

53:20.416 --> 53:22.208
[grunts] Not now. God damn it.

53:23.208 --> 53:24.083
[gasping]

53:24.166 --> 53:26.708
-Lou, what's the matter?
-Nothing.

53:29.333 --> 53:32.041
-[gasps]
-Lou! [screams]

53:32.125 --> 53:33.250
[both yelling]

53:45.041 --> 53:49.000
[coughing]

53:50.083 --> 53:51.166
[spits]

53:52.083 --> 53:53.583

53:55.333 --> 53:56.625

53:57.416 --> 53:58.916
[grunts and gasps]

53:59.708 --> 54:01.416
[strains]

54:01.500 --> 54:04.083
[gasping]

54:06.166 --> 54:07.458
Oh God.

54:07.541 --> 54:09.541
Lou, wake up. Lou.

54:10.125 --> 54:11.375
-Oh…
-[coughs]

54:11.458 --> 54:13.458
-[yells]
-Oh, thank God.

54:13.541 --> 54:14.500
Let me help you up.

54:14.583 --> 54:16.583
-[grunts] Get off me.
-[gasps]

54:18.541 --> 54:19.458
[gasps]

54:19.541 --> 54:20.833
[both groaning]

54:23.791 --> 54:25.708
I can help you if you just let me.

54:25.791 --> 54:27.416
[Lou] I don't need your help.

54:28.541 --> 54:30.416
[groaning]

54:33.750 --> 54:35.541
-[crack]
-[groans] Oh, fuck!

54:37.041 --> 54:39.958
[grunts] Get up.
We just lost an hour on him.

54:41.500 --> 54:43.375
[gasping]

54:45.875 --> 54:47.291
[groans]

54:50.958 --> 54:52.500
[gasping]

54:53.208 --> 54:55.125

-[sniffles and spits]

55:03.166 --> 55:04.375
[crow cawing]

55:20.041 --> 55:21.125
[Hannah grunts]

55:25.333 --> 55:26.333
[static crackles]

55:26.416 --> 55:28.958
Hey, I told you to leave that behind.

55:29.041 --> 55:32.041
Storm's passed.
I'm gonna climb up to that hilltop.

55:32.125 --> 55:33.916
-Try to connect.
-There's no time.

55:34.416 --> 55:37.416
God damn it. Can you stop
bein' so stubborn? We need help.

55:37.500 --> 55:39.583
-There is no one who can help us.
-[sighs] Shit.

55:39.666 --> 55:43.666
-I'm all you've got. Now keep movin'.
-[sighs] Why are you helpin' me, Lou?

55:43.750 --> 55:45.500
-Huh?
-Eagle Bay's just ahead.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.708
-Don't slow me down.
-God damn it.

55:48.708 --> 55:49.708
[sighs]

56:01.041 --> 56:02.541
[sighs] We missed them.

56:02.625 --> 56:04.833
No one's comin' or goin'
in water this rough.

56:05.833 --> 56:07.958
-[Hannah] Then what's his plan?
-Over here.

56:40.666 --> 56:41.875
[grunts]

56:44.000 --> 56:45.583
[creaking]

56:58.750 --> 57:00.458
-[grunts]
-[Hannah] Vee!

57:01.416 --> 57:02.291
Vee!

57:02.375 --> 57:03.375
[Lou gasps]

57:03.458 --> 57:05.333
-Where did you take her?
-Stop.

57:05.416 --> 57:07.500
-[muffled sobs]
-He's fucking with you.

57:08.500 --> 57:10.083
[muffled cries]

57:10.166 --> 57:11.458
We can do this all day.

57:11.541 --> 57:12.875
[sobbing]

57:15.500 --> 57:16.958
[weeping]

57:39.458 --> 57:41.875
[Lou] Maybe you're right.
Maybe we do need help.

57:42.708 --> 57:44.000
[Hannah sighs]

57:44.083 --> 57:45.625
Go back to that hill.

57:46.125 --> 57:49.708
See if you can raise Rankin.
Emergency services are channel 16.

57:49.791 --> 57:51.625
Meet me back here when you're done.

57:52.416 --> 57:53.458
Thank you.

57:54.291 --> 57:55.875
What are you gonna do?

57:55.958 --> 57:57.250
[Lou] I need to rest.

57:57.333 --> 57:58.500
[gasping] Go on.

57:59.916 --> 58:01.166
Hey, hold up.

58:03.708 --> 58:05.333
Try not to blow your brains out.

58:13.166 --> 58:14.250
[sighs]

58:58.458 --> 59:00.333
[whirring]

59:08.208 --> 59:10.208
[gasping]

59:24.291 --> 59:25.708
There we are. [chuckles]

59:26.791 --> 59:27.875
Frozen in time.

59:28.666 --> 59:30.083
Together forever.

59:30.666 --> 59:32.041
Wanna do another one?

59:40.541 --> 59:41.625
Did you know…

59:43.250 --> 59:48.000
that there are handprints like these
in caves all over the world?

59:48.083 --> 59:51.333
And long after you
and Mommy and I are all dead…

59:52.750 --> 59:55.708
these handprints are still gonna be here.

1:00:16.416 --> 1:00:17.916
[Philip grunts]

1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:19.875
[Philip breathing shakily]

1:00:28.583 --> 1:00:29.958
[owl hoots]

1:00:34.958 --> 1:00:36.250
[gasps and shudders]

1:00:41.625 --> 1:00:42.875
[sighs]

1:00:47.291 --> 1:00:48.875
[panting]

1:00:50.791 --> 1:00:52.458
[groans] Hello?

1:00:52.541 --> 1:00:53.541
[static crackling]

1:00:53.625 --> 1:00:56.708
[Hannah, breaking up] Hello?
Can anyone hear me? Hello?

1:00:56.791 --> 1:00:58.000
[chainsaw roars]

1:01:00.833 --> 1:01:02.041
Can anybody hear me?

1:01:04.416 --> 1:01:05.333
Hello?

1:01:06.500 --> 1:01:08.083
Hello, anybody?

1:01:08.166 --> 1:01:09.625
-God damn it.
-This is Sheriff Rankin.

1:01:09.708 --> 1:01:10.958
-[gasps]
-Who is this? Over.

1:01:11.041 --> 1:01:13.333
Sheriff! [laughs] Sheriff Rankin.

1:01:13.416 --> 1:01:14.875
Oh God. Thank God.

1:01:14.958 --> 1:01:16.250
This is-- this is Hannah Dawson.

1:01:16.333 --> 1:01:19.416
[breaking up] …kidnapped.

1:01:19.500 --> 1:01:20.500
Kidnapped?

1:01:23.250 --> 1:01:24.375
Hannah, can you hear me?

1:01:24.458 --> 1:01:25.833
Can you repeat that, please?

1:01:25.916 --> 1:01:27.250
Uh-- Okay.

1:01:27.333 --> 1:01:29.708
[gasps] My daughter
was kidnapped by her father.

1:01:29.791 --> 1:01:32.250
[voice breaking up] I'm…

1:01:32.333 --> 1:01:33.583
Lou Adell is with me…

1:01:33.666 --> 1:01:35.208
Hannah, can you please confirm?

1:01:35.291 --> 1:01:37.458
[breaking up] Hannah Dawson?
Can you hear me?

1:01:37.541 --> 1:01:38.625
What?

1:01:38.708 --> 1:01:40.083
Say that… say that again?

1:01:40.166 --> 1:01:41.666
-Come on, come on, come on.
-[static]

1:01:41.750 --> 1:01:42.833
Sheriff?

1:01:43.958 --> 1:01:46.708
[sighs] Oh fuck. Okay…

1:01:46.791 --> 1:01:47.666
[static]

1:01:47.750 --> 1:01:48.750
Shit.

1:01:50.500 --> 1:01:51.666
Torres, come in.

1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:55.583
-[Torres] Go, Sheriff.
-Listen, we got a situation.

1:01:56.083 --> 1:01:57.416
This is gonna sound a bit crazy,

1:01:57.500 --> 1:02:02.250
but I think Hannah Dawson's daughter
has been kidnapped by… by her father.

1:02:03.291 --> 1:02:04.333
What?

1:02:05.083 --> 1:02:08.833
Listen, let's put it on the wire,
right away,

1:02:08.916 --> 1:02:10.750
in case she's taken off the island.

1:02:11.333 --> 1:02:14.791
Okay? Hannah and Vee Dawson and Lou Adell.

1:02:14.875 --> 1:02:16.250
I think she mentioned Lou.

1:03:46.833 --> 1:03:49.041
[footsteps]

1:03:50.208 --> 1:03:51.125
The guns.

1:03:52.125 --> 1:03:53.041
Slowly.

1:04:16.250 --> 1:04:17.541
[clattering]

1:04:29.500 --> 1:04:30.791
Hello, Philip.

1:04:34.833 --> 1:04:35.958
Don't worry about her.

1:04:36.916 --> 1:04:39.041
I've made sure she'll sleep through this.

1:04:39.833 --> 1:04:42.291
Just tell me one thing.
And be honest here.

1:04:43.666 --> 1:04:45.125
Why'd you sell me out?

1:04:48.791 --> 1:04:51.708
I knew you'd track down Hannah and Vee
sooner or later.

1:04:51.791 --> 1:04:53.666
I wasn't gonna be able
to protect them forever.

1:04:53.750 --> 1:04:56.875
Protect them? [scoffs]
All of this is happening because of you.

1:04:58.416 --> 1:05:01.708
Okay? And Hannah may be too naive
to-- to see it, but I don't.

1:05:01.791 --> 1:05:03.333
Hannah doesn't know who I am.

1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:10.000
[laughs]

1:05:10.666 --> 1:05:12.666
You still can't even admit I'm your son.

1:05:14.708 --> 1:05:16.000
[sighs]

1:05:18.958 --> 1:05:21.791
So what's the plan, Philip?
Why the elaborate chase?

1:05:22.291 --> 1:05:24.708
Why let us track you?
You don't wanna hurt your kid.

1:05:24.791 --> 1:05:28.708
Did you know that Vee is the same age
as I was when those-- those men took me?

1:05:30.041 --> 1:05:32.500
Yeah, but they weren't as nice as, uh…

1:05:33.958 --> 1:05:35.041
as I'm being to her.

1:05:36.833 --> 1:05:39.875
Can you appreciate that?
The symmetry of that?

1:05:42.291 --> 1:05:44.708
I thought my mommy
was comin' back to save me, too.

1:05:44.791 --> 1:05:48.458
It was a trap. If I'd tried to save you,
they would have had us both.

1:05:48.541 --> 1:05:50.375
Bullshit. You wanted
to maintain your cover.

1:05:50.458 --> 1:05:52.583
I was a pawn for your mission.
Nothin' else.

1:05:52.666 --> 1:05:57.291
-I had you rescued. I got you out of Iran.
-Then why didn't you come back with me?

1:05:57.375 --> 1:05:58.416
Here's why.

1:05:59.166 --> 1:06:02.875
Because you chose the fucking CIA
over your own child.

1:06:04.041 --> 1:06:06.041
Yeah, how'd that work out for you? Hmm?

1:06:06.708 --> 1:06:09.291
I mean, did you guys fuck up anything
worse than you fucked up Iran?

1:06:11.500 --> 1:06:14.416
And then you steal my wife
and-- and my kid--

1:06:14.500 --> 1:06:17.416
Hannah and Vee had nothing to do
with my mistakes. Leave them out of this.

1:06:17.500 --> 1:06:19.583
Oh, spare me the fuckin' morality lesson.

1:06:19.666 --> 1:06:21.666
You gave up that right a long time ago.

1:06:24.458 --> 1:06:25.625
It's not too late.

1:06:27.625 --> 1:06:29.791
You move, I'mma put a bullet in you.

1:06:31.333 --> 1:06:32.541
It's not too late.

1:06:33.333 --> 1:06:35.500
Leave Vee with me and go.

1:06:36.625 --> 1:06:38.250
I'll throw them off your trail.

1:06:39.916 --> 1:06:41.875
Philip, listen to me.

1:06:41.958 --> 1:06:43.041
You're right.

1:06:43.750 --> 1:06:45.833
I didn't protect you when you were a kid.

1:06:45.916 --> 1:06:47.208
So let me do it now.

1:06:47.291 --> 1:06:48.791
[chuckles]

1:06:48.875 --> 1:06:49.833
Shut up.

1:06:49.916 --> 1:06:51.333
What, you wanna kill me?

1:06:52.541 --> 1:06:53.500
Do it.

1:06:55.083 --> 1:06:58.291
Before I knew you took Vee last night,
I had my rifle pressed against my head.

1:06:58.375 --> 1:06:59.416
I'm not afraid to go.

1:07:00.375 --> 1:07:04.041
[mumbles] You just can't stop
messin' with my head, can't you?

1:07:04.125 --> 1:07:05.833
Kid, I wouldn't even know where to start.

1:07:07.250 --> 1:07:10.083
The minute I heard you blew yourself up,
I knew it was time.

1:07:10.166 --> 1:07:13.208
I thought Hannah and Vee were safe.
My mission was complete.

1:07:13.291 --> 1:07:14.750
But you tricked me there, didn't you?

1:07:16.500 --> 1:07:18.166
You always were smarter than me.

1:07:21.208 --> 1:07:23.666
Beat my ass at chess
when you were five years old.

1:07:26.250 --> 1:07:27.416
Remember that?

1:07:30.291 --> 1:07:31.291
I do.

1:07:37.375 --> 1:07:38.708
Oh, Philip.

1:07:40.458 --> 1:07:41.708
You know what?

1:07:45.250 --> 1:07:48.125
For once, we're playin' my game.

1:07:59.333 --> 1:08:01.208
It's time to end this legacy.

1:08:01.291 --> 1:08:03.958
Put this whole family out of its misery.

1:08:07.166 --> 1:08:08.208
Philip,

1:08:08.791 --> 1:08:10.125
you're her father.

1:08:10.208 --> 1:08:12.166
And you're my mother.

1:08:12.250 --> 1:08:13.791
[grunts]

1:08:15.166 --> 1:08:16.916
Oh my God…

1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:19.125
[both yelling]

1:08:22.875 --> 1:08:24.041
[groans]

1:09:21.958 --> 1:09:23.958
[muffled screaming]

1:09:27.708 --> 1:09:29.166
[Lou] No!

1:09:29.250 --> 1:09:30.791
[man shouts]

1:09:33.041 --> 1:09:34.916
Mom! Mom!

1:09:35.416 --> 1:09:36.500
[gasps]

1:09:37.458 --> 1:09:39.958
We'll be waiting for you
at the lighthouse.

1:09:40.541 --> 1:09:42.000
Make sure you bring Hannah.

1:09:42.500 --> 1:09:43.750
Don't take too long.

1:09:45.541 --> 1:09:47.666
[grunts and gasps]

1:09:48.791 --> 1:09:49.791
Fuck.

1:09:58.833 --> 1:10:01.583
[man on radio] Just checking in on ya.
How are you doing out there?

1:10:01.666 --> 1:10:04.458
-Talk to me, Deputy.
-Still no hits on the APBs.

1:10:04.541 --> 1:10:07.666
I notified ATF about the bomb in the truck
and the coroner about the body.

1:10:07.750 --> 1:10:10.250
They're sending teams
when the weather lets up.

1:10:10.333 --> 1:10:11.875
[phone ringing]

1:10:13.666 --> 1:10:15.625
Orcas Island Sheriff's Department.

1:10:15.708 --> 1:10:16.750
Yes, sir.

1:10:16.833 --> 1:10:19.125
Sheriff, it's the federal marshals.

1:10:21.958 --> 1:10:24.958
-This is Rankin. Who's this?
-Sheriff, Dominick Crown here.

1:10:25.041 --> 1:10:26.666
Did you receive
our facsimile transmission?

1:10:26.750 --> 1:10:28.083
Yeah, I got it right here.

1:10:28.583 --> 1:10:31.875
We've seen the APB
for the woman you know as Lou Adell.

1:10:31.958 --> 1:10:34.000
Is she a match
for the person in that photo?

1:10:34.083 --> 1:10:36.125
[Rankin] Yeah.
Yeah, it sure looks like her.

1:10:36.208 --> 1:10:38.416
-How confident are you, Sheriff?
-It's her.

1:10:38.500 --> 1:10:41.000
-[fax machine whirs]
-And the second individual?

1:10:41.500 --> 1:10:43.541
-[bleep]
-[Rankin] Hang on one second.

1:10:43.625 --> 1:10:45.208
Do you recognize him?

1:10:45.291 --> 1:10:48.250
No. Are you telling me
that this guy is involved?

1:10:48.333 --> 1:10:51.125
Do you have any intel
on the location of these individuals?

1:10:51.208 --> 1:10:53.500
-Are they together?
-Well, I don't know if they're together.

1:10:53.583 --> 1:10:57.250
What I believe is that they're headed to
Eagle Bay, on the west side of our island.

1:10:57.333 --> 1:11:00.250
We need to make sure no civilians
go anywhere near that location.

1:11:00.333 --> 1:11:01.958
Set up roadblocks and cordon the area.

1:11:02.041 --> 1:11:04.500
There's a kidnapped girl
and her mother out there.

1:11:05.500 --> 1:11:07.083
-Hold.
-Excuse me?

1:11:07.166 --> 1:11:08.833
[hold music plays]

1:11:08.916 --> 1:11:11.708
Asshole put me on hold. Unbelievable.

1:11:12.416 --> 1:11:13.708
[scoffs]

1:11:13.791 --> 1:11:14.916
Un-fuckin'-believable.

1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:17.291
-[marshal] Sheriff Rankin?
-Yeah, right here.

1:11:17.375 --> 1:11:19.916
The male fugitive
is US Army Special Forces,

1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:22.500
convicted in the murder
of numerous civilians.

1:11:22.583 --> 1:11:25.750
The female is a high-priority target
for the CIA.

1:11:25.833 --> 1:11:27.500
The CIA? Lou Adell?

1:11:27.583 --> 1:11:31.000
This investigation is now under
the jurisdiction of the US Marshals.

1:11:31.083 --> 1:11:33.000
Lethal force has been authorized.

1:11:33.083 --> 1:11:35.083
Do not allow any approach to Eagle Bay.

1:11:35.166 --> 1:11:37.166
-Not by your department, not--
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:11:37.250 --> 1:11:40.291
There-- there is a kidnapped girl
and her mother out there.

1:11:40.375 --> 1:11:42.166
Stay out of our way, Sheriff.

1:11:43.458 --> 1:11:45.625
-[hangs up]
-[engaged tone]

1:11:48.166 --> 1:11:50.416
-[Lou groaning]
-[Hannah panting]

1:11:53.416 --> 1:11:55.958
[Hannah] Lou, sorry it took me so long.

1:11:56.041 --> 1:11:59.166
I tried to get as high as I could, but…

1:11:59.250 --> 1:12:02.166
-[groans]
-Jesus. Oh shit.

1:12:02.750 --> 1:12:05.583
Oh God, oh God, oh God. Okay, wait, wait.
Let me help. Let me help.

1:12:05.666 --> 1:12:07.041
-[groans]
-[gasps]

1:12:07.833 --> 1:12:09.666
-Did he do this?
-[groans]

1:12:10.416 --> 1:12:12.500
And Vee? Is she… is she all right?

1:12:12.583 --> 1:12:16.458
She's okay for now.
He's taking her to the lighthouse.

1:12:17.250 --> 1:12:18.416
-Okay, wait, wait, wait.
-Wait.

1:12:18.500 --> 1:12:20.125
-Move your hand right now.
-Okay…

1:12:21.041 --> 1:12:22.083
Do it quick--

1:12:22.166 --> 1:12:23.416
[screams]

1:12:24.375 --> 1:12:25.583
-[groans]
-Oh shit.

1:12:25.666 --> 1:12:28.375
-Pack the wound.
-I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming.

1:12:28.875 --> 1:12:31.583
Fill it with gauze.
As-- as much as you can.

1:12:31.666 --> 1:12:33.666
[Hannah whimpers] Oh God.

1:12:34.583 --> 1:12:36.208
-Oh shit.
-Come on, deeper.

1:12:36.291 --> 1:12:38.500
-Really pack it in. [grunts]
-I'm trying.

1:12:38.583 --> 1:12:40.125
-[groans]
-Jesus, Lou.

1:12:40.208 --> 1:12:42.583
-I'm so sorry I dragged you into this.
-[moans]

1:12:42.666 --> 1:12:44.583
Put your hand here. Right. Press down.

1:12:44.666 --> 1:12:46.500
Okay, good. I gotta--
I gotta grab some tape.

1:12:46.583 --> 1:12:49.291
Hannah. Did you reach the sheriff?

1:12:49.375 --> 1:12:50.916
-Uh, I don't know.
-Leave it.

1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:52.583
-[Hannah] Wait, uh--
-It's fine.

1:13:05.208 --> 1:13:07.625
I found those at the cabin.
I meant to tell you.

1:13:10.750 --> 1:13:11.750
You're lying.

1:13:33.625 --> 1:13:35.125
[gasps]

1:13:36.458 --> 1:13:38.125
This message isn't for me, is it?

1:13:38.708 --> 1:13:40.416
[sighs] None of them are.

1:13:45.708 --> 1:13:47.208
[breathing shakily]

1:13:48.291 --> 1:13:49.541
Say it.

1:13:51.208 --> 1:13:52.583
I need you to say it.

1:13:57.208 --> 1:13:58.208
Say it!

1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:02.791
He's… my son.

1:14:04.958 --> 1:14:06.250
[gasps]

1:14:07.833 --> 1:14:08.708
[exhales]

1:14:09.500 --> 1:14:13.708
When I was stationed in Iran, I had
to get close to a very dangerous man.

1:14:13.791 --> 1:14:15.791
-[gasps]
-Very close.

1:14:16.708 --> 1:14:17.958
No, no, no, no.

1:14:18.458 --> 1:14:19.500
[sighs] Oh God…

1:14:20.041 --> 1:14:22.125
I kept the baby to keep my cover.

1:14:22.208 --> 1:14:25.958
You mean… you mean Philip?
The baby? You mean your son?

1:14:26.041 --> 1:14:27.375
[sighs]

1:14:27.458 --> 1:14:28.916
So what is this? Some game?

1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:32.083
You fucking with me?
What, you tell him where we were, or…

1:14:32.166 --> 1:14:34.500
-What-- what is this?
-No. I wasn't helping him.

1:14:34.583 --> 1:14:37.250
-I was helping you. You and Vee.
-Stop lying to me.

1:14:37.333 --> 1:14:39.333
-Tell me the goddamn truth!
-[yells]

1:14:40.458 --> 1:14:43.000
I got you to this island.

1:14:43.083 --> 1:14:44.958
Your old friend from college?

1:14:45.041 --> 1:14:49.208
The one who told you about the beautiful
secluded place on Orcas Island

1:14:49.291 --> 1:14:51.000
with the cheap rent?

1:14:51.083 --> 1:14:54.208
I had her run into you on the street.
[sighs]

1:14:55.250 --> 1:14:56.375
[scoffs]

1:14:57.666 --> 1:14:59.666
I tried to stop him.

1:15:01.750 --> 1:15:03.416
I blackmailed the CIA

1:15:03.500 --> 1:15:06.416
to force an investigation
into what he did in El Salvador.

1:15:07.250 --> 1:15:10.166
-You think you saved us?
-I knew he'd track you eventually.

1:15:10.250 --> 1:15:13.583
You didn't save us.
I got Vee away from him.

1:15:14.833 --> 1:15:17.333
I took care of her every goddamn day
and made sure she was safe.

1:15:17.416 --> 1:15:19.916
Now she's out there with him
because of you.

1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:22.208
You're no damn hero.
You're a fucking coward.

1:15:22.291 --> 1:15:24.625
-Wow.
-All that rage that that man felt.

1:15:24.708 --> 1:15:26.708
All the rage inside of that man
that he felt,

1:15:26.791 --> 1:15:29.833
that he aimed towards me,
is because of you.

1:15:29.916 --> 1:15:32.541
Not everybody is meant to be a mother.

1:15:33.125 --> 1:15:34.208
[sighs]

1:15:34.291 --> 1:15:35.375
[coughs]

1:15:39.875 --> 1:15:41.166
Yeah, maybe not.

1:15:43.375 --> 1:15:45.583
But you could have been
a little more human.

1:15:47.833 --> 1:15:50.166
You drove past our trailer every day.

1:15:50.250 --> 1:15:52.625
You drove past
your own granddaughter, Lou.

1:15:52.708 --> 1:15:56.500
You didn't talk to her.
You didn't speak to her.

1:15:56.583 --> 1:15:58.416
You didn't look at her.

1:15:59.208 --> 1:16:02.250
What kind of person
could do that to their own family?

1:16:07.250 --> 1:16:10.125
[grunts] Come on. We gotta keep moving.

1:16:10.208 --> 1:16:11.541
There ain't no more "we."

1:16:11.625 --> 1:16:13.916
Hannah, you don't know
where they're going.

1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:16.625
You said the lighthouse.
I'll follow the coastline.

1:16:16.708 --> 1:16:19.083
Not on your own. It's a trap.

1:16:19.166 --> 1:16:23.291
-Please. There's one thing I'm good for.
-Not anymore.

1:16:23.875 --> 1:16:25.333
You'll just slow me down.

1:16:31.583 --> 1:16:33.583
[cicadas chirping]

1:16:42.583 --> 1:16:43.625
[gasps]

1:17:04.958 --> 1:17:06.208
[Philip screaming] Mama!

1:17:06.291 --> 1:17:07.708
Mama!

1:17:07.791 --> 1:17:09.833
Mama! Mom!

1:17:16.416 --> 1:17:17.416
[crash]

1:17:37.833 --> 1:17:39.041
[chirps]

1:17:51.416 --> 1:17:52.666
[Jax growls]

1:17:55.708 --> 1:17:56.916
[whimpers]

1:18:04.833 --> 1:18:06.833
[Jax barking]

1:18:09.791 --> 1:18:10.833
-Jax.
-[barking]

-[grunts]
-[Rankin] Lou!

1:18:23.083 --> 1:18:24.500
Are you okay?

1:18:25.250 --> 1:18:27.541
Never thought I'd be excited to see you.

1:18:27.625 --> 1:18:29.166
-First time for everything.
-[sighs]

1:18:29.250 --> 1:18:31.250
-Where's Hannah?
-On her way to the lighthouse.

1:18:31.333 --> 1:18:32.833
And her daughter?

1:18:32.916 --> 1:18:35.208
-Already there with the…
-Okay.

1:18:36.583 --> 1:18:37.500
…the kidnapper.

1:18:38.208 --> 1:18:41.750
He's armed. Very dangerous.

1:18:41.833 --> 1:18:43.833
That's exactly what the feds said
about you.

1:18:44.333 --> 1:18:47.416
You stay here. I'll send someone for you
as soon as the road's clear.

1:18:47.500 --> 1:18:51.416
Wait. For fuck's sake, help me outside.
I'm suffocating in here.

1:18:51.500 --> 1:18:54.083
-Come on. I got this.
-[groans]

1:18:54.666 --> 1:18:55.541
[Lou sighs]

1:18:55.625 --> 1:18:58.041
You gonna tell me why
the CIA's lookin' for you, Lou?

1:18:58.125 --> 1:19:00.166
[Lou] I used some evidence I held onto.

1:19:00.250 --> 1:19:01.833
-[groans]
-What kind of evidence?

1:19:03.500 --> 1:19:07.083
Documents. Proving CIA involvement
in the coup in Iran.

1:19:07.166 --> 1:19:10.208
Ah. I can see why
they'd be pissed about that.

1:19:10.291 --> 1:19:12.208
-[sighs]
-Lou, they're on their way.

1:19:12.291 --> 1:19:14.583
[Lou] Fuck, they won't care
about collateral damage.

1:19:14.666 --> 1:19:16.541
You gotta get Hannah and Vee out of there.

1:19:16.625 --> 1:19:17.583
-Ow!
-[Rankin] Here.

1:19:17.666 --> 1:19:18.500
[Lou] Come on.

1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:22.291
[groans] This thing starts up again,
I'm gonna bleed out.

1:19:23.583 --> 1:19:26.166
Will you get the first-aid kit?
I left it in there.

1:19:26.250 --> 1:19:27.666
[groans]

1:19:30.125 --> 1:19:31.625
[Lou whistles]

1:19:34.750 --> 1:19:35.875
[grunts] Okay.

1:19:39.208 --> 1:19:40.750
[engine revs]

1:19:41.791 --> 1:19:43.791
Lou! Lou!

1:19:48.666 --> 1:19:50.125
You gotta be kidding me.

1:19:50.208 --> 1:19:51.291
[yells] Lou!

1:19:52.208 --> 1:19:53.250
[Vee screams] Mommy!

1:19:53.333 --> 1:19:54.250
[gasps]

1:19:55.125 --> 1:19:56.333
-[Vee] Mommy!
-[Hannah] Vee!

1:19:57.083 --> 1:19:59.416
-[Vee] Come! Please, come!
-[panting]

1:19:59.500 --> 1:20:01.791
-Vee!
-I'm here, Mama!

1:20:01.875 --> 1:20:03.791
-Up here!
-I'm coming!

1:20:05.458 --> 1:20:07.458
[gasping]

1:20:19.708 --> 1:20:21.958
[gull squawking]

1:20:29.416 --> 1:20:32.166
[breathing heavily] Baby?

1:20:43.041 --> 1:20:44.083
-Mommy!
-[Hannah laughs]

1:20:44.166 --> 1:20:45.208
Hi, Mommy.

1:20:45.291 --> 1:20:46.666
[sighs] Hi, baby.

1:20:46.750 --> 1:20:49.208
We were afraid you weren't gonna show up.
Weren't we, Vee?

1:20:49.291 --> 1:20:50.375
You okay?

1:20:50.458 --> 1:20:53.250
Of course she's okay.
She's with her daddy.

1:20:57.791 --> 1:20:59.000
[grunts]

1:20:59.916 --> 1:21:01.291
Come, give Mommy a hug.

1:21:02.208 --> 1:21:03.291
[Vee and Hannah gasp]

1:21:04.416 --> 1:21:07.916
Hey, how's-- how's Lou doin'?
Is she-- Is she on her way?

1:21:08.916 --> 1:21:11.208
Jesus, look at me. [chuckles]

1:21:12.333 --> 1:21:15.666
Still waitin' for my mommy to come back
after all these years, huh?

1:21:17.250 --> 1:21:19.291
But we do need her here to finish this.

1:21:23.208 --> 1:21:25.583
I wanna give Mommy a hug.

1:21:27.750 --> 1:21:28.625
Well…

1:21:35.625 --> 1:21:37.000
Philip, please.

1:21:46.833 --> 1:21:48.166
[Vee] Please, Daddy?

1:21:49.041 --> 1:21:50.458
[Philip] Okay, Vee. [kisses]

1:21:50.541 --> 1:21:52.375
One quick hug while we wait for Lou.

1:21:52.458 --> 1:21:53.750
[both laugh]

1:21:53.833 --> 1:21:55.291
[Hannah sobbing]

1:21:55.375 --> 1:21:57.666
[laughing] Oh, I missed you so much.

1:22:00.583 --> 1:22:01.750
[breathing rapidly]

1:22:04.916 --> 1:22:06.541
[breathing shakily]

1:22:09.958 --> 1:22:11.583
[whispers] Game on.

1:22:16.833 --> 1:22:18.916
Daddy, may I go to the bathroom?

1:22:26.750 --> 1:22:28.333
[Philip] Of course you can, Vee.

1:22:28.833 --> 1:22:31.625
But hey… Come right back, okay?

1:22:42.041 --> 1:22:43.666
[chuckles]

1:22:45.416 --> 1:22:47.333
Wow, Lou is really rubbin' off on you.

1:22:49.458 --> 1:22:52.333
Come on, just give me the gun.
We both know you're not gonna shoot me.

1:22:52.916 --> 1:22:56.125
You don't know me, Phil. You never did.

1:22:56.791 --> 1:22:58.041
[Philip] No?

1:22:58.125 --> 1:23:01.291
I know that if you were gonna shoot me,
you would have done it years ago.

1:23:04.875 --> 1:23:07.000
I know that you're not like Lou and me.

1:23:10.083 --> 1:23:11.000
You're not.

1:23:11.083 --> 1:23:13.208
Yeah, 'cause she would've shot me already.

1:23:18.791 --> 1:23:19.875
Come on. Give me the gun.

1:23:20.416 --> 1:23:21.625
[screams]

1:23:21.708 --> 1:23:22.833
[whimpering]

1:23:31.833 --> 1:23:34.250
[groaning] Oh, you--

1:23:35.750 --> 1:23:39.750
You abandon me, and then
you steal my baby from me,

1:23:39.833 --> 1:23:41.125
and now you shoot me?

1:23:41.208 --> 1:23:42.625
That shit won't work on me.

1:23:42.708 --> 1:23:44.416
Not gonna work on me anymore, Phil.

1:23:44.500 --> 1:23:47.125
[shudders] I'm not afraid of you anymore.

1:23:48.458 --> 1:23:52.083
And I won't let you hurt my little girl
the way you hurt me.

1:23:55.583 --> 1:23:56.750

1:24:00.250 --> 1:24:01.416
[Philip groans]

[Hannah yells]

1:24:03.750 --> 1:24:04.625
[screams]

1:24:07.375 --> 1:24:09.250
[Hannah yelling]

1:24:11.208 --> 1:24:13.208
-Hannah!
-[gasping]

1:24:14.875 --> 1:24:16.958
Hannah. Hannah.

1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:19.375
[both panting]

1:24:25.041 --> 1:24:26.166
Do you remember?

1:24:27.750 --> 1:24:29.250
[Hannah shudders]

1:24:33.708 --> 1:24:34.916
Do you remember…

1:24:37.291 --> 1:24:38.666
how it felt?

1:24:45.416 --> 1:24:46.541
[shakily] Yeah.

1:24:46.625 --> 1:24:48.333
[gasping] I remember.

1:24:48.958 --> 1:24:50.458

1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:57.333

1:24:58.166 --> 1:24:59.416
[screams]

1:25:09.666 --> 1:25:11.416
Vee! We have to run!

1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:13.708
[grunting]

1:25:15.916 --> 1:25:16.791
[gasps]

1:25:18.291 --> 1:25:19.958

1:25:21.375 --> 1:25:22.791
[screams]

1:25:28.041 --> 1:25:28.916
Vee!

1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:30.541
[straining]

1:25:31.333 --> 1:25:32.541
[groans]

1:25:34.458 --> 1:25:35.750
[clang echoes]

1:25:49.708 --> 1:25:51.666
[bleeping]

1:25:54.416 --> 1:25:55.750
[Hannah] Oh shit.

1:25:59.625 --> 1:26:00.708
Vee?

1:26:00.791 --> 1:26:02.000
[Philip sighs]

1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:07.666
Game's over, okay?
Come here, Little Rabbit.

1:26:07.750 --> 1:26:10.375
[groans] We gotta go right now.

1:26:10.458 --> 1:26:12.458
[footsteps echoing on stairs]

1:26:14.625 --> 1:26:15.875
[gasps]

1:26:15.958 --> 1:26:17.916
Oh! Oh, baby.

1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:20.250
Come on. Get up. Are you okay?

1:26:20.791 --> 1:26:22.791
Did he hurt you?
He didn't hurt you, right?

1:26:22.875 --> 1:26:23.833
Mm-mm.

1:26:25.333 --> 1:26:27.000
[metal creaking]

1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:30.666
Oh! Hide. Hide. Hide.

1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:34.208
[footsteps on stairs]

1:26:43.416 --> 1:26:44.291
Lou.

1:26:45.291 --> 1:26:46.750
-Hannah.
-[Hannah] Come on.

1:26:49.791 --> 1:26:51.583
-[clattering]
-We need to move.

1:26:54.166 --> 1:26:55.416
-[Philip] Vee?
-[gasps]

1:26:58.500 --> 1:27:00.125
-My gun.
-[Hannah] Lost it.

1:27:00.750 --> 1:27:03.083
-Knife?
-Stuck in Philip's hand.

1:27:04.041 --> 1:27:05.375
[clattering]

1:27:05.458 --> 1:27:07.166
[grunting]

1:27:08.458 --> 1:27:10.541
Try that hatch. Go, go, now.

1:27:18.333 --> 1:27:21.416
-Wait, your jacket's stuck.
-[Lou] Oh fuck.

1:27:22.541 --> 1:27:23.708
[Hannah] Push you up.

1:27:24.500 --> 1:27:25.750
[grunts]

1:27:27.041 --> 1:27:27.916
[yells]

1:27:28.541 --> 1:27:30.333
Run to the end of the beach.

1:27:30.416 --> 1:27:31.708
-Run as fast as you can.
-No!

1:27:31.791 --> 1:27:33.291
-I'll meet you there.
-Don't leave me.

1:27:33.375 --> 1:27:35.958
We won't fit.
You gotta run now. Go, go, go, go.

1:27:36.041 --> 1:27:37.833
Run, Little Rabbit! Run!

1:27:38.875 --> 1:27:40.708
[Lou] It's rigged. I can't defuse it.

1:27:40.791 --> 1:27:43.250
Could buy us some time
if I can change the frequency.

1:27:43.333 --> 1:27:45.083
-Wait. Where are you going?
-[panting]

1:27:45.166 --> 1:27:47.291
One of us was actually a Girl Scout.

1:27:48.541 --> 1:27:50.291
[Philip groaning]

1:28:06.500 --> 1:28:07.916
[gasps]

1:28:13.250 --> 1:28:14.708
[banging]

1:28:15.375 --> 1:28:17.500
-Do you still have the radio?
-Yeah.

1:28:17.583 --> 1:28:20.875
Maybe we can use it after all.
Go bust that gate open.

1:28:24.166 --> 1:28:25.000
[Philip] Lou?

1:28:25.791 --> 1:28:26.708
[gasps]

1:28:26.791 --> 1:28:28.000
We're all here.

1:28:32.375 --> 1:28:33.250
We're all here.

1:28:33.333 --> 1:28:34.166
[grunts]

1:28:34.250 --> 1:28:35.250
[bleeping]

1:28:35.333 --> 1:28:38.666
I was hoping
that we could all do this together.

1:28:42.833 --> 1:28:45.125
-Face to face!
-[bleeping]

1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:49.666
So that we could end this… the right way.

1:28:51.750 --> 1:28:53.500
End this right.

1:28:56.291 --> 1:28:57.583
As a family.

1:29:00.208 --> 1:29:01.250
As a family.

1:29:03.291 --> 1:29:04.625
[bleeping]

1:29:04.708 --> 1:29:06.833
But sometimes,
you don't get what you want.

1:29:14.500 --> 1:29:16.083
[shuddering]

1:29:18.833 --> 1:29:19.750
Fuck!

1:29:19.833 --> 1:29:21.333
[helicopter engine whirring]

-[gasping]
-[Philip yells] Fuck!

1:29:38.875 --> 1:29:41.208
[screams] Fuck! You fuckin' let me in!

1:29:41.958 --> 1:29:43.458
Oh, thank God.

1:29:43.541 --> 1:29:44.666
[screams]

1:29:52.708 --> 1:29:53.833
Oh shit.

1:29:54.875 --> 1:29:56.750
[barking]

1:30:00.708 --> 1:30:02.250
-[Lou] Oh shit.
-[Hannah] What?

1:30:02.333 --> 1:30:04.208
-[Lou] The CIA's on the hunt.
-[barks]

1:30:04.750 --> 1:30:07.250
[panting] They comin' for Philip or you?

1:30:07.333 --> 1:30:08.291
[both grunt]

1:30:08.375 --> 1:30:10.708
They won't want either one of us
to leave here alive.

1:30:10.791 --> 1:30:12.333
-Go, go.
-No.

1:30:12.416 --> 1:30:14.583
-I'll just slow you down.
-I'm not gonna leave you here.

1:30:14.666 --> 1:30:17.875
Lou, go get your granddaughter to safety.
I'll catch up.

1:30:24.291 --> 1:30:26.291
[Philip panting]

1:30:37.083 --> 1:30:38.166
Fuck!

1:30:40.500 --> 1:30:41.333
[yells] Fuck!

Fuck!

1:31:06.916 --> 1:31:07.875
Vee…

1:31:08.666 --> 1:31:10.208
Oh! Come here.

1:31:12.208 --> 1:31:13.208
Oof!

1:31:25.125 --> 1:31:27.416
You're a brave little girl. You know that?

1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:33.625
Good. Help me up, will you?

1:31:34.166 --> 1:31:35.750
[gasping]

1:31:38.416 --> 1:31:42.083
Okay, listen to me.
I want you to go grab a stick, okay?

1:31:42.166 --> 1:31:44.250
The longest one you can find. Go, go, go.

1:32:18.916 --> 1:32:20.583
-Mommy!
-Hey, baby.

1:32:21.166 --> 1:32:23.208
Hannah. The radio.

1:32:23.291 --> 1:32:24.375
[Hannah] In my pocket.

1:32:25.166 --> 1:32:26.458
-[Lou] Come on.
-[Hannah] Help me.

1:32:26.541 --> 1:32:27.916
-All right.
-Come on, go, run.

1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:29.291
[Hannah gasps]

1:32:29.833 --> 1:32:31.375
Hannah, hold this up as high as you can.

1:32:34.125 --> 1:32:36.125
-[Hannah] Are you calling for help?
-[Lou] Yeah.

1:32:36.625 --> 1:32:37.791
[Vee squeals]

1:32:43.791 --> 1:32:46.250
[Lou] Yeah.
That ought to get their attention.

1:32:52.541 --> 1:32:55.000
You gotta go.
Take the road back towards town.

1:32:55.500 --> 1:32:57.875
-Bring Jax with you.
-You… you come with us.

1:32:57.958 --> 1:33:00.208
Hannah, you take care of your kid…

1:33:01.416 --> 1:33:02.500
I'll take care of mine.

1:33:03.250 --> 1:33:06.208
I left a letter for you at my house.
Make sure you find it.

1:33:06.791 --> 1:33:09.000
Okay. Go on, Vee.

1:33:10.083 --> 1:33:11.333
Oh, God damn it.

1:33:14.250 --> 1:33:15.208
[gasps]

1:33:15.833 --> 1:33:17.208
Don't die on me now, Lou.

1:33:19.875 --> 1:33:22.166
Everything that matters
is right here in front of you.

1:33:23.875 --> 1:33:24.750
I know.

1:33:26.416 --> 1:33:28.041
Go. Now!

1:33:35.458 --> 1:33:37.166

-[yells]
-[screams]

1:36:28.375 --> 1:36:29.666
I'm sorry, kid.

1:36:31.833 --> 1:36:33.541
[gunfire]

1:37:16.416 --> 1:37:18.833
[birdsong]

1:37:38.666 --> 1:37:39.916
-Hey, Vee.
-[Vee] Hey.

1:37:40.541 --> 1:37:41.791
[Rankin] Hello, Jax.

1:37:42.458 --> 1:37:44.583
Hey, you got two bracelets now.

1:37:45.250 --> 1:37:47.750
Yeah. Just like you.

1:37:48.625 --> 1:37:49.833
[chuckles]

1:37:49.916 --> 1:37:51.083
One's for a friend.

1:37:51.666 --> 1:37:54.583
[man] So, out of the blue, she just leaves
you and your daughter this house?

1:37:54.666 --> 1:37:58.458
Mm-hm. Yeah, this house
and a ton of frozen deer meat.

1:37:58.541 --> 1:37:59.625
[knocking]

1:37:59.708 --> 1:38:01.083
It's open.

1:38:01.583 --> 1:38:03.375
-Hey, Han.
-[Hannah] Hey.

1:38:03.458 --> 1:38:04.541
Oh, hello.

1:38:06.416 --> 1:38:07.666
You guys still around?

1:38:07.750 --> 1:38:09.583
We had a few more questions
for Ms. Dawson here.

1:38:09.666 --> 1:38:12.291
Oh. I hope I'm not interrupting.

1:38:12.375 --> 1:38:16.416
[clears throat]
Hannah, uh, coroner's got an issue.

1:38:16.500 --> 1:38:20.375
You're next of kin. He needs a signature
to release Philip's body for burial.

1:38:20.875 --> 1:38:22.583
-[sighs]
-Yeah. Sorry.

1:38:25.583 --> 1:38:27.833
Ms. Dawson, did Lou Adell ever mention

1:38:27.916 --> 1:38:31.375
anything about documents
from her time in the CIA to you?

1:38:31.458 --> 1:38:33.583
She'd be a pretty shit spy if she did.

1:38:33.666 --> 1:38:34.791
[snorts]

1:38:36.875 --> 1:38:38.250
If you think of anything…

1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:42.416
[chuckles] You gave me a card last time
you were here, and the time before that.

1:38:42.500 --> 1:38:43.708
Anything at all.

1:38:45.500 --> 1:38:46.541
All right.

1:38:51.375 --> 1:38:53.416
-[agent] Sheriff.
-Good to see you again.

1:38:55.708 --> 1:38:57.333
-[door closes]
-[sighs]

1:38:58.875 --> 1:39:00.375
[both chuckle]

1:39:01.166 --> 1:39:02.625
-Forget them.
-Mm.

1:39:02.708 --> 1:39:04.875
Looks like you two are ready for Seattle.

1:39:04.958 --> 1:39:06.500
Yeah, you're all packed up.

1:39:07.041 --> 1:39:08.333
Yeah, almost.

1:39:08.416 --> 1:39:11.625
I wanted to tell you, you just did
a beautiful job with the memorial service.

1:39:11.708 --> 1:39:12.541
-Stop.
-No, you did.

1:39:12.625 --> 1:39:14.625
And I think Lou would have
really appreciated it.

1:39:14.708 --> 1:39:18.916
[scoffs] Come on now. All that sincere
emotion would have made her puke.

1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:20.583
-[both laugh]
-Yeah!

1:39:21.875 --> 1:39:23.166
Oh, well…

1:39:23.666 --> 1:39:24.958
[Hannah sighs]

1:39:25.583 --> 1:39:27.791
-She was her own person.
-Mm-hm.

1:39:27.875 --> 1:39:31.666
I mean, sometimes,
I'm just so damn mad at her, and then…

1:39:33.166 --> 1:39:35.458
[sighs] Other times I miss her.

1:39:36.666 --> 1:39:38.916
Isn't that just how it is with family?

1:39:45.625 --> 1:39:49.416
[Lou] "I've never been one for many words,
so I'll keep this short."

1:39:53.125 --> 1:39:55.500
"The house is yours. Sell it."

1:39:56.333 --> 1:40:00.291
"There's a month's worth of meat for Jax
in the freezer, and some cash for you."

1:40:04.833 --> 1:40:07.125
"Life doesn't give you second chances,

1:40:07.208 --> 1:40:09.500
but sometimes
it does offer a fresh start."

1:40:16.958 --> 1:40:20.166
"Hannah, you're going
to wonder why I did it."

1:40:20.250 --> 1:40:21.750
"Why I left this all for you."

1:40:23.541 --> 1:40:24.958
"The simple answer is,

1:40:26.458 --> 1:40:29.000
you'll leave the world
a better place than I did."
