WEBVTT

00:01.269 --> 00:02.682
Previously on "The Originals"...

00:02.711 --> 00:05.823
We take Hope and the pack,
and we leave town tonight.

00:05.853 --> 00:07.863
There's a jazz club in Algiers.

00:07.893 --> 00:10.748
Josephine is fortifying it
as a sanctuary against magic.

00:10.778 --> 00:11.850
Pack your things.

00:11.880 --> 00:13.019
(Klaus): So while my hands are full,

00:13.049 --> 00:14.988
I need you to serve as my eyes and ears.

00:15.018 --> 00:16.859
I can't just stab him in the back.

00:16.889 --> 00:18.497
I don't know if you have a choice.

00:18.527 --> 00:20.506
He should be here by now.
Something must have happened.

00:20.536 --> 00:23.421
- Everything ok?
- Are we going to Algiers or what?

00:23.451 --> 00:25.891
Right now, that club is
the safest place in town.

00:25.921 --> 00:28.869
You lost the one thing that
you could have used against me,

00:28.899 --> 00:30.983
the weapon you created.

00:31.013 --> 00:32.347
No!

00:32.348 --> 00:34.216
(Freya): This was not my plan.

00:34.318 --> 00:36.753
You rushed it and made
but a single weapon.

00:36.755 --> 00:39.661
Your materials are easily found.

00:39.663 --> 00:41.333
Unh!

00:42.475 --> 00:43.825
Ohh!

00:43.855 --> 00:45.388
Viking ashes are indeed rare,

00:45.418 --> 00:48.266
but all you really need
is a burning viking corpse.

00:48.296 --> 00:52.446
I must use you to send a message to all
those who would side against me.

00:58.179 --> 01:00.986
(Music playing)

01:01.674 --> 01:03.491
Is something the matter, brother?

01:03.493 --> 01:05.497
Could I fix you a drink perhaps?

01:05.498 --> 01:07.940
Strangely enough, Niklaus,
I'm not in a mimosa mood.

01:07.970 --> 01:09.853
Fantastic! More for me.

01:09.883 --> 01:12.056
Let's discuss strategy, shall we, Niklaus.

01:12.086 --> 01:14.391
Just wondering if you actually have one.

01:14.421 --> 01:16.222
We can begin with Mikael's ashes.

01:16.224 --> 01:19.095
Given that they are the main ingredient
in our weapon against Dahlia,

01:19.125 --> 01:21.273
would you care to tell me
where they disappeared to?

01:21.275 --> 01:22.730
Elijah, I have compelled

01:22.760 --> 01:26.591
the city's finest pastry chef for
your personal edification,

01:26.621 --> 01:30.660
and yet you ignore my efforts
in favor of needless concerns.

01:30.662 --> 01:33.436
Can we stop talking so loudly?

01:34.608 --> 01:35.943
Give me that.

01:35.945 --> 01:39.814
What's the matter? New witch body
not up to last night's bender?

01:39.844 --> 01:41.978
So I had a few.

01:42.008 --> 01:46.007
It's not every day you lose your father
at the hands of your brother

01:46.037 --> 01:47.780
- again.
- Who ever said opportunity

01:47.810 --> 01:49.238
only knocks once, eh?

01:49.240 --> 01:52.473
Heh heh heh.

01:52.503 --> 01:55.385
Oh, come on! We all fled Mikael's
tyranny together for centuries.

01:55.415 --> 01:58.093
I would have thought the mood this
morning might be a bit more jubilant.

01:58.123 --> 02:00.307
Under normal circumstances,
the annihilation of our father

02:00.337 --> 02:02.098
would be rather commendable, Niklaus.

02:02.100 --> 02:04.997
Unfortunately, we have a
greater threat to contend with.

02:05.027 --> 02:08.603
You know, for someone who's been invited
to a celebratory breakfast,

02:08.633 --> 02:10.452
you're proving quite the buzz kill.

02:10.482 --> 02:13.520
Well, Niklaus if indeed
anything has killed the buzz,

02:13.550 --> 02:17.532
as you say, perhaps it was because
murdering father alienated the one person

02:17.562 --> 02:19.711
who truly knows how to defeat Dahlia.

02:19.741 --> 02:21.904
If Freya wants to be a part of this family,

02:21.906 --> 02:24.518
she should be willing to accept us,

02:24.548 --> 02:25.684
warts and all.

02:25.714 --> 02:26.980
(Rebekah): Elijah's right.

02:26.982 --> 02:28.526
Freya loved Mikael,

02:28.556 --> 02:30.497
and you've likely ruined everything.

02:30.527 --> 02:32.427
Pity. Whatever shall I do?

02:32.429 --> 02:34.705
Whatever you please apparently.

02:34.735 --> 02:38.145
Do not mistake my high
spirits for lack of clarity.

02:38.175 --> 02:40.143
I know full well the threat we face,

02:40.173 --> 02:44.151
and I intend to deal with it personally.

02:48.395 --> 02:50.555
Someone's here.

02:54.474 --> 02:56.304
Josephine.

02:56.334 --> 02:59.652
Forgive me for calling so early, Elijah,

02:59.682 --> 03:01.615
but I've come bearing a message

03:01.617 --> 03:04.153
from your aunt Dahlia.

03:04.155 --> 03:07.425
She is owed a debt, and
she means to be paid.

03:07.427 --> 03:09.398
She can writhe in hell first.

03:09.428 --> 03:12.930
For merely taking what
your mother promised her?

03:12.932 --> 03:14.933
If you must harbor hatred,
isn't it better spent

03:14.935 --> 03:17.209
on the one who traded your child away

03:17.239 --> 03:19.339
a thousand years ago?

03:19.341 --> 03:22.349
Blame Esther if you must,

03:22.379 --> 03:26.450
but I seek only to fulfill a bargain,

03:27.023 --> 03:29.856
a bargain that consequently resulted

03:29.858 --> 03:32.195
in your very existence.

03:32.407 --> 03:35.137
Perhaps you should be thanking me.

03:42.787 --> 03:45.039
Dahlia.

03:45.041 --> 03:51.315
My child, I prefer aunt Dahlia.

03:54.154 --> 03:57.047
You dare enter my home?

03:57.077 --> 04:01.312
I only came for what is mine.

04:01.314 --> 04:07.104
The time has come to add
the child's power to my own,

04:07.134 --> 04:09.482
though I do not detect her here.

04:09.484 --> 04:12.353
I see you've used a spell

04:12.355 --> 04:13.982
to cloak her.

04:14.012 --> 04:17.926
No matter. Such spells will yield,

04:17.928 --> 04:20.028
as will you.

04:20.029 --> 04:22.732
Say your farewells.

04:22.734 --> 04:25.504
You have till nightfall tomorrow,

04:25.506 --> 04:30.572
and then the child shall be mine.

04:30.574 --> 04:33.701
Be a dear and inform the mother.

04:33.731 --> 04:38.405
No reason we can't be civilized about this.

04:59.161 --> 05:02.083
(Hayley): Ok. Good news... Dahlia still
doesn't know that we're here.

05:02.113 --> 05:03.996
Bad news... she's given
us until tomorrow night,

05:03.998 --> 05:05.965
and then she's coming for Hope.

05:07.700 --> 05:09.364
Well, I say we get the hell out of here.

05:09.394 --> 05:12.333
Look, Jack. I want to go as much
as you do, but think.

05:12.363 --> 05:15.111
Freya said that Dahlia
was drawn to Hope's magic.

05:15.141 --> 05:18.075
No matter how far we go, she's still
gonna be able to track us.

05:18.105 --> 05:19.862
At least this place is spelled.

05:19.892 --> 05:22.819
No one can do magic
here, not Hope or Dahlia.

05:22.849 --> 05:24.222
Sure this place is spelled,

05:24.252 --> 05:26.090
but we've seen bigger
magic than this break.

05:26.120 --> 05:28.273
I say we run while we can.

05:31.226 --> 05:33.258
It's a risk either way.

05:33.260 --> 05:34.893
She's just so little.

05:34.895 --> 05:36.835
It's not fair.

05:36.865 --> 05:39.170
Witchcraft and magical spells.

05:39.172 --> 05:42.341
She didn't ask for any of this,

05:42.934 --> 05:47.640
which means that she
wouldn't miss it if it was gone.

05:47.670 --> 05:49.547
Jack, maybe that's it.

05:49.577 --> 05:52.873
Dahlia can only sense her
when she's using magic,

05:52.875 --> 05:55.155
so what if there's a way of stopping her

05:55.185 --> 05:56.641
from doing it in the first place?

05:56.643 --> 05:58.281
She's just a baby. How we gonna do that?

05:58.311 --> 06:00.010
I have an idea,

06:00.012 --> 06:02.514
although it's dangerous,

06:02.516 --> 06:03.817
especially now.

06:03.819 --> 06:06.154
(Aiden): Let me do it.

06:06.156 --> 06:08.322
Look. Whatever it is,

06:08.324 --> 06:11.357
it's my fault you guys
didn't get away yesterday.

06:11.359 --> 06:12.665
That wasn't your fault, Aiden.

06:12.695 --> 06:15.666
Please just give me a
chance to make it up to you.

06:27.275 --> 06:30.946
Freya, I am so sorry.

06:30.948 --> 06:33.252
About what?

06:33.282 --> 06:35.210
Certainly not our father.

06:35.240 --> 06:36.551
I alone mourn him

06:36.553 --> 06:39.522
as I alone loved him,

06:39.524 --> 06:41.690
and now because of Klaus,

06:41.692 --> 06:44.191
my father is taken from me once more.

06:47.030 --> 06:50.068
I never knew the man you're now mourning.

06:50.070 --> 06:52.204
He showed more tenderness to you yesterday

06:52.206 --> 06:55.037
than we have ever seen.

06:55.067 --> 06:58.741
All I can recall is his terrible temper,

06:58.743 --> 07:01.766
his awful cruelty, especially to Klaus.

07:01.796 --> 07:04.116
That is not an excuse.

07:04.146 --> 07:06.279
Isn't it?

07:06.281 --> 07:09.454
I know that Klaus can be infuriating,

07:09.456 --> 07:10.924
treacherous even,

07:10.926 --> 07:13.292
but there is no one
better to have by your side

07:13.294 --> 07:15.193
against someone like Dahlia.

07:18.196 --> 07:22.230
Klaus wants Hope safe just as much
as you want your freedom.

07:22.260 --> 07:23.747
We need to work together.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.472
Oh, how can you defend him?

07:26.474 --> 07:29.528
I was abducted by Dahlia,
spent years under her control,

07:29.558 --> 07:32.245
and yet he acts as if I am the enemy

07:32.247 --> 07:36.653
I have given you all
every reason to trust me,

07:36.655 --> 07:40.025
and still Klaus rejects me.

07:40.027 --> 07:42.580
In all honesty...

07:43.998 --> 07:48.919
I cannot understand why you
would continue to trust him.

07:53.001 --> 07:55.839
You and Elijah have a choice.

07:55.841 --> 08:00.214
From now on, it's either Klaus or me.

08:14.638 --> 08:17.539
You do understand there is no time.

08:19.842 --> 08:23.094
Niklaus, if Mikael's ashes
are the key to ending Dahlia,

08:23.124 --> 08:25.076
then surely you must see the
need to share their whereabouts.

08:25.078 --> 08:27.279
I see nothing of the sort.

08:27.281 --> 08:29.154
It is no secret

08:29.184 --> 08:31.750
that you often strategize while painting.

08:31.752 --> 08:33.251
I assume you have a plan, Nik.

08:33.253 --> 08:34.866
You ask that I share my strategies

08:34.895 --> 08:38.059
so you can run straight to Freya
and bring her into the circle of trust.

08:38.090 --> 08:40.895
- I think not.
- It is too dangerous for you, brother.

08:40.926 --> 08:42.104
You cannot do this alone.

08:42.134 --> 08:44.692
And whom should I trust to protect Hope?

08:44.915 --> 08:48.458
Our newfound sister with
duplicitous motives of her own?

08:48.488 --> 08:51.602
Hayley, whose allegiance to her
husband grows stronger by the day,

08:51.632 --> 08:54.304
or how about Jackson, the
self-declared king of the wolves?

08:54.334 --> 08:55.900
You need only trust me.

08:55.902 --> 08:57.607
I would love to, Elijah.

08:57.637 --> 08:59.224
Now more than ever, I need my brother,

08:59.254 --> 09:03.437
my closest ally, my blood...

09:03.747 --> 09:07.479
But you have not been the same
since mother got inside your head.

09:07.509 --> 09:09.109
Your judgment is not what it was.

09:09.111 --> 09:10.998
You are not what you were.

09:11.028 --> 09:13.362
The Elijah I know would never have clung

09:13.392 --> 09:16.299
so desperately to the word
of a duplicitous stranger,

09:16.329 --> 09:18.215
telling him what he wants to hear.

09:18.217 --> 09:19.952
Freya is our blood, brother.

09:19.954 --> 09:22.470
She also has every reason
to want Dahlia's demise.

09:22.500 --> 09:23.861
We have no cause to distrust her.

09:23.863 --> 09:27.595
Which is a far cry from being trustworthy.

09:27.597 --> 09:29.408
She vanquished Finn, yes,

09:29.438 --> 09:31.197
but only after she herself resurrected him,

09:31.199 --> 09:33.969
and though lauded for saving
Rebekah from Eva Sinclair,

09:33.971 --> 09:35.305
how do we know she didn't have a hand

09:35.307 --> 09:37.174
in waking that demon in the first place?

09:37.204 --> 09:39.972
Niklaus, if we cannot trust one another,

09:39.974 --> 09:42.173
we can't work together.

09:44.778 --> 09:47.846
No. We cannot.

09:57.422 --> 09:59.390
Aiden.

09:59.392 --> 10:01.290
To what do I owe this visit?

10:01.292 --> 10:04.674
I just wanted to tell you
that Hayley, Jackson, and Hope

10:04.704 --> 10:06.225
are at Marcel's jazz club,

10:06.255 --> 10:11.031
and they're safe there,
very well protected.

10:11.250 --> 10:13.766
Well, you can hardly be
my eyes and ears there

10:13.768 --> 10:17.234
if you're standing before me.

10:17.236 --> 10:19.374
Why are you here?

10:19.404 --> 10:22.342
Uh, for this.

10:22.344 --> 10:24.176
Hayley said she left it here yesterday.

10:24.178 --> 10:26.682
I guess it's Hope's favorite.

10:26.712 --> 10:28.144
Hmm.

10:33.954 --> 10:37.686
Your loyalty is refreshing.

10:37.688 --> 10:39.122
Heh.

10:41.326 --> 10:44.095
However...

10:44.345 --> 10:46.436
Your life will be worth less

10:46.466 --> 10:49.895
than the velveteen on this little rabbit

10:49.897 --> 10:54.205
if I find my faith in
you has been misplaced.

10:54.235 --> 10:55.802
Understood?

10:59.266 --> 11:00.910
(Aiden): Klaus doesn't suspect a thing.

11:00.912 --> 11:04.241
Oh, right. Yes, I'm sure that Klaus
"color me paranoid" Mikaelson

11:04.271 --> 11:05.701
totally fell for your whole

11:05.731 --> 11:07.697
"I came across the river
for Hope's bunny" ruse.

11:07.727 --> 11:11.878
Look. These manacles are spelled
to neutralize witch power, right?

11:11.908 --> 11:13.798
So, Davina, if you could
transfer the magic from these

11:13.828 --> 11:16.171
onto something smaller,
just think about it.

11:16.173 --> 11:19.242
If the baby can't give off magic,
then Dahlia won't be able to track her.

11:19.272 --> 11:21.308
I could try, but what
difference does it make?

11:21.338 --> 11:23.177
I thought the baby was already safe.

11:23.179 --> 11:26.280
Jackson and Hayley are
getting ready to run.

11:26.432 --> 11:28.832
Wow.

11:29.030 --> 11:30.503
Good for them.

11:32.807 --> 11:36.406
If Kol had asked me to
run before he got hexed,

11:36.659 --> 11:39.173
well, he wouldn't have had to ask me twice.

11:43.729 --> 11:48.227
Ok. Let's say I do this.

11:49.017 --> 11:53.060
Aren't we forgetting one
really important thing?

11:53.447 --> 11:57.147
- If Klaus finds out what you did...
- Let me worry about that.

12:03.602 --> 12:07.068
(Rustling, voices whispering)

12:23.322 --> 12:25.789
(Hayley): They're dahlias.

12:25.791 --> 12:27.422
She knows we're here.

12:40.637 --> 12:42.484
(No signal tone)

12:43.924 --> 12:45.156
(Dials)

12:45.158 --> 12:46.290
(No signal tone)

12:46.292 --> 12:47.887
Oh, come on.

12:50.759 --> 12:52.987
- (Crack)
- Aah!

12:54.851 --> 12:58.563
I need you to go get help now. Go, go!

13:01.989 --> 13:03.521
(Crack)

13:13.641 --> 13:16.253
(Whistling melody)

13:19.155 --> 13:21.806
(Whistling continues)

13:25.028 --> 13:26.228
(Rebekah): So that's it?

13:26.230 --> 13:28.869
I'm to choose between the brother
I've known a thousand years

13:28.899 --> 13:30.665
and the sister I've always wanted,

13:30.667 --> 13:33.156
and of course, Nik doesn't
exactly make it easy

13:33.186 --> 13:34.832
with his ruddy painting.

13:34.834 --> 13:37.508
It's like he's just fiddling
away while Rome burns.

13:37.538 --> 13:40.472
Klaus is at his best when there's
an enemy he needs to take down.

13:40.474 --> 13:43.043
I guarantee he's got a plan.

13:43.045 --> 13:44.611
And what if that plan doesn't bear fruit

13:44.613 --> 13:46.350
before nightfall tomorrow?

13:46.380 --> 13:47.615
We've been through worse, all right?

13:47.617 --> 13:49.751
We'll get through this.

13:49.753 --> 13:51.387
(Sighs)

13:51.689 --> 13:52.991
I wish I could just ship him off

13:52.993 --> 13:55.427
to bloody sardinia or somewhere

13:55.429 --> 13:57.147
with his paints and his wine cellar

13:57.177 --> 13:59.374
until this all blows over.

13:59.404 --> 14:01.002
So what's the alternative?

14:01.004 --> 14:03.772
We can't go up against him,
we got no way to put him down.

14:03.802 --> 14:05.479
No.

14:05.814 --> 14:08.346
Instead, here we are,

14:08.376 --> 14:10.514
gearing up for the fight of our lives,

14:10.544 --> 14:14.094
and all anyone can worry
about is his next move.

14:23.460 --> 14:26.033
I had a feeling I would be seeing you.

14:27.636 --> 14:32.060
I understand you built a marker for father.

14:32.062 --> 14:34.733
I wish to contribute this.

14:41.406 --> 14:44.350
- How did you...
- Niklaus stole it from Mikael long ago.

14:44.380 --> 14:47.083
He would use it to carve

14:47.085 --> 14:48.789
these tiny, little wooden figurines

14:48.819 --> 14:51.654
for Rebekah and myself.

14:51.656 --> 14:54.524
Like your own, his was
not a happy childhood.

14:54.526 --> 14:57.900
Art was something of
a sanctuary for Niklaus

14:57.930 --> 14:59.235
and remains so to this day.

14:59.265 --> 15:01.982
Do you tell me this so I
might sympathize with him

15:02.012 --> 15:05.364
as you do incessantly?

15:06.039 --> 15:08.117
I assume Rebekah gave you my ultimatum.

15:08.147 --> 15:10.208
I don't accept ultimatums,

15:10.238 --> 15:14.006
nor will I make a choice
between yourself and Niklaus.

15:14.008 --> 15:15.707
I will not trust my freedom

15:15.709 --> 15:17.577
to an alliance with Klaus,

15:17.579 --> 15:20.932
which means you will fight Dahlia alone,

15:20.962 --> 15:23.474
- and you will lose.
- You came to us,

15:23.504 --> 15:26.452
tired of running, desperate to be free,

15:26.454 --> 15:29.751
and searching for the kind of strength
that can only come from family.

15:29.781 --> 15:31.289
Now with or without you,

15:31.291 --> 15:33.258
Klaus and I will defeat Dahlia,

15:33.260 --> 15:35.595
and I would prefer you to be by our side.

15:35.597 --> 15:37.964
You would ask me to stay and watch

15:37.966 --> 15:39.798
as we all become Dahlia's chattel.

15:39.800 --> 15:41.964
Stay...

15:43.404 --> 15:46.606
And we defeat Dahlia together,

15:46.608 --> 15:47.976
or you may leave

15:47.978 --> 15:50.260
and consign yourself to a life of solitude.

15:50.290 --> 15:53.780
My sister, is there really any choice?

15:57.586 --> 15:59.622
Swear to me that you will not allow

15:59.624 --> 16:01.929
Klaus to be our undoing.

16:10.506 --> 16:13.042
Bad time?

16:13.044 --> 16:15.514
Camille. Ah, yes.

16:15.516 --> 16:17.182
As I've recently proved disagreeable,

16:17.184 --> 16:18.650
I assume Elijah asked you here

16:18.652 --> 16:20.881
to play therapist to the savage best.

16:20.911 --> 16:24.294
Actually, I was just gonna say you look
like you could use some fresh air.

16:24.324 --> 16:25.844
Maybe we could go for a walk.

16:25.874 --> 16:27.698
You could spend, I don't know, 5 seconds

16:27.728 --> 16:30.132
not obsessing about who not to trust

16:30.162 --> 16:31.294
and who you're gonna murder next.

16:31.296 --> 16:33.290
I quite enjoy my obsessions,

16:33.320 --> 16:35.464
thank you very much.

16:35.466 --> 16:38.072
Fear not. I shall tell
Elijah you came as asked,

16:38.074 --> 16:43.176
and you may leave assured
your duty is fulfilled.

16:43.178 --> 16:44.678
Klaus...

16:47.082 --> 16:49.149
Talk to me

16:49.179 --> 16:51.251
and not because Elijah sent me.

16:55.020 --> 16:57.087
(Footsteps)

16:57.479 --> 16:59.855
It's ok, baby girl.

17:05.464 --> 17:07.487
(Gasps)

17:08.170 --> 17:10.303
What a beauty.

17:10.305 --> 17:11.904
Hello, my child.

17:14.279 --> 17:15.712
I...

17:19.449 --> 17:21.588
I was hoping for a more intimate chat,

17:21.617 --> 17:24.384
though I sense by entering

17:24.386 --> 17:26.626
you would have me at a
considerable disadvantage.

17:26.656 --> 17:27.833
Why don't you come on in?

17:27.863 --> 17:30.129
I'd love to show you
some hybrid hospitality.

17:30.131 --> 17:32.032
I only wanted to see the little one

17:32.034 --> 17:34.368
who has been promised to me.

17:34.370 --> 17:36.370
Won't be long now.

17:36.372 --> 17:38.872
Surely you've noticed
the spell protecting you

17:38.874 --> 17:40.038
is growing weaker.

17:40.040 --> 17:41.909
If you lay a finger on her,

17:41.939 --> 17:43.926
I swear I will make you suffer in ways

17:43.956 --> 17:47.458
even your evil mind can't imagine.

17:47.655 --> 17:49.177
Hayley, is it?

17:49.179 --> 17:50.544
I have no quarrel with you.

17:50.546 --> 17:52.944
Esther made this bargain long ago.

17:52.946 --> 17:55.113
It's most unfortunate that
you've been dragged into it.

17:55.115 --> 17:57.266
You talk like you don't have a choice,

17:57.296 --> 17:59.086
but this is your doing.

17:59.088 --> 18:01.132
When I give my word, I keep it,

18:01.162 --> 18:03.698
and I expect others to do the same.

18:03.728 --> 18:06.563
Esther and I made a
bargain a long time ago,

18:06.565 --> 18:08.539
and so, you see, that child

18:08.569 --> 18:10.738
is rightfully mine.

18:10.740 --> 18:12.476
The only question that you need ask

18:12.478 --> 18:13.777
is would you deny me,

18:13.779 --> 18:15.511
knowing that it would mean your death?

18:15.541 --> 18:17.781
You're not taking her.

18:18.291 --> 18:22.828
You're frightened for your child. Heh.

18:22.858 --> 18:24.689
I can assure you anything that Freya

18:24.719 --> 18:26.455
may have told you about our life together,

18:26.485 --> 18:28.835
well, she always had a
flair for the dramatic.

18:28.865 --> 18:31.196
Well, it seems to run in the family.

18:31.198 --> 18:34.197
Well, then of course, most of my troubles

18:34.199 --> 18:35.532
with Freya stemmed from the fact

18:35.534 --> 18:39.305
that I came for her so late in life.

18:39.307 --> 18:44.045
She had such a strong memory of
the family that I took her from,

18:44.516 --> 18:47.350
but Hope is still young.

18:47.352 --> 18:50.777
She won't cling to the memory of you

18:50.807 --> 18:52.655
or cry for you in her sleep.

18:52.657 --> 18:54.494
You can take comfort in the fact

18:54.524 --> 18:58.361
that for her it will be
as if you never existed.

18:58.649 --> 18:59.898
Come closer.

18:59.900 --> 19:02.806
Let's see how a witch with
no magic does against me.

19:02.836 --> 19:05.102
(Hope crying)

19:05.104 --> 19:09.575
Well... You've upset the child.

19:11.991 --> 19:16.117
Pity. You ought not to waste
your last hours with her this way.

19:16.119 --> 19:19.152
You should spend your
time saying your farewells.

19:19.470 --> 19:23.262
Nightfall tomorrow will come all too soon.

19:25.399 --> 19:30.609
Good-bye for now, little one.

19:37.302 --> 19:39.739
(Cami): Have you ever thought about how
hard this must have been for Freya,

19:39.769 --> 19:41.639
being raised by this woman?

19:41.641 --> 19:43.040
I mean, you of all people should at least

19:43.042 --> 19:44.408
have some compassion for that.

19:44.438 --> 19:48.692
Yes, yes, poor Freya, but
that's my point exactly.

19:48.722 --> 19:50.864
I of all people know whether
the parent raising you

19:50.894 --> 19:54.522
loves you or loathes you,
they still form who you are.

19:54.524 --> 19:57.993
After all this time, am I not Mikael's son,

19:58.023 --> 20:02.064
and therefore, is Freya not just
as dangerous as Dahlia herself?

20:02.066 --> 20:03.668
We've been talking for 20 minutes,

20:03.670 --> 20:05.124
and that's the first time
you brought up Mikael.

20:05.154 --> 20:07.309
I see no reason to dwell on the deceased.

20:07.311 --> 20:08.777
You made an alliance with him,

20:08.779 --> 20:10.179
you fought beside him,

20:10.181 --> 20:11.448
and then you killed him.

20:11.450 --> 20:13.418
Yes, for the second time.

20:13.420 --> 20:14.787
Your point?

20:14.789 --> 20:16.490
You don't have any feelings about that?

20:16.492 --> 20:20.563
My only feeling is a
lingering sense of annoyance

20:20.792 --> 20:22.767
that he didn't stay dead the first time.

20:22.769 --> 20:23.868
I don't believe you.

20:23.870 --> 20:25.136
Mikael raised you.

20:25.138 --> 20:27.404
And I ended him...

20:30.987 --> 20:33.263
After the first good
day we ever had together.

20:33.293 --> 20:34.565
We actually made quite a team,

20:34.595 --> 20:39.555
and just when it looked as though
we might for once be allies,

20:39.847 --> 20:42.479
I drove a stake through his heart.

20:45.121 --> 20:48.420
Because he said he loved Freya?

20:49.066 --> 20:53.617
Or maybe it's just what I do...

20:53.839 --> 20:56.448
kill my enemies, sometimes my friends.

20:56.450 --> 21:00.019
This may come as a
surprise to you, Camille,

21:00.021 --> 21:02.977
but I'm not a terribly good person.

21:05.658 --> 21:08.132
(Josh): So after I realized that I was
spending, like, 3 hours a day on reddit,

21:08.162 --> 21:09.700
I just thought, "this stupid, you know?

21:09.730 --> 21:11.236
I'm just gonna start
reading the times-picayune,"

21:11.238 --> 21:13.510
I mean, even though it is, like, the
weirdest name ever for a newspaper. It's...

21:13.540 --> 21:16.848
- Josh.
- Huh?

21:16.850 --> 21:18.658
I love you.

21:24.789 --> 21:26.757
Oh, no.

21:26.759 --> 21:28.160
What are you gonna do?

21:28.162 --> 21:29.362
Here's the thing.

21:29.364 --> 21:31.033
I am who I am, ok?

21:31.035 --> 21:34.274
Loyalty is in my DNA, but I can't live
with myself if I'm spying for Klaus

21:34.304 --> 21:36.806
because I'm not cut out
to be a double agent,

21:36.808 --> 21:38.787
so I'm gonna tell Jackson everything.

21:38.817 --> 21:40.279
What? Because it's so much better

21:40.281 --> 21:41.715
to be killed by Jackson than Klaus?

21:41.717 --> 21:44.048
And even if he doesn't kill you, then what?

21:44.050 --> 21:46.015
Then meet me in two hours.

21:46.017 --> 21:49.394
Let's get out of here and finally
start our life together.

21:49.424 --> 21:51.326
Wow!

21:51.328 --> 21:53.161
You really want to just...

21:53.425 --> 21:55.827
Go...With me?

21:55.829 --> 21:58.265
Like I said, I am who I am.

21:58.267 --> 22:02.524
I'm a pack guy, and you are my pack now.

22:02.554 --> 22:05.645
Uh, leave? Ok. Yeah. Wow.

22:05.675 --> 22:07.276
Heh. I mean... heh...

22:07.278 --> 22:09.411
I'm finally pronouncing all
the street names right,

22:09.413 --> 22:11.316
and I know I... I did die here and all,

22:11.346 --> 22:13.148
but, well, this was the first place

22:13.150 --> 22:15.081
I ever felt like myself.

22:15.111 --> 22:19.018
I know this is all really fast,

22:19.020 --> 22:21.353
but if you want this,

22:21.355 --> 22:23.668
I'll see you in two hours.

22:40.904 --> 22:42.622
Yes.

22:42.624 --> 22:44.374
I'll be there.

22:44.404 --> 22:47.500
- Of course, I'll be there.
- Ok.

22:57.173 --> 22:58.911
Good.

23:03.818 --> 23:06.402
Hey, Aiden.

23:07.125 --> 23:09.743
I love you, too.

23:28.168 --> 23:30.439
Whoa! Hold it. It's just me.

23:30.441 --> 23:32.606
I... I come in peace.

23:32.608 --> 23:35.285
You should know better
than to sneak up on me.

23:36.376 --> 23:37.840
I wasn't sneaking.

23:37.870 --> 23:41.389
Just haven't talked to you in a while.

23:41.419 --> 23:43.249
What do you want, Marcel?

23:43.251 --> 23:45.187
Look. I know you been
going through a hard time,

23:45.189 --> 23:48.154
holed up in here ever since Kol died,

23:48.156 --> 23:49.456
trying to bring him back.

23:49.458 --> 23:50.924
What do you care?

23:50.926 --> 23:52.360
You hated him anyway.

23:52.362 --> 23:55.386
Oh, I didn't hate him.
I just didn't much like him,

23:55.416 --> 23:58.705
and to be honest, I really
didn't like him for you.

23:58.707 --> 24:00.361
You know, I can be a little protective.

24:00.391 --> 24:02.156
Yeah.

24:02.158 --> 24:05.589
Understatement of the year.

24:05.591 --> 24:07.926
You know, even though I appreciate

24:07.928 --> 24:10.062
you saving me from Eva...

24:13.099 --> 24:16.649
You never once bothered to ask
me how I felt after Kol died.

24:18.604 --> 24:21.910
And even after all the crazy
things that I've been through,

24:21.940 --> 24:23.641
that was the worst.

24:23.643 --> 24:25.310
That's when I needed you most.

24:29.184 --> 24:30.685
You're right.

24:30.687 --> 24:34.160
I'm truly sorry that
I wasn't there for you,

24:34.534 --> 24:37.491
but we have a
problem... Klaus.

24:37.493 --> 24:39.192
What else is new?

24:40.727 --> 24:42.164
Kol told me that you guys were working

24:42.166 --> 24:43.701
on a weapon to use against him.

24:43.703 --> 24:45.896
Rebekah heard that it was a dagger,

24:45.926 --> 24:47.768
one that would work even on Klaus.

24:47.770 --> 24:49.587
I need to know if you finished it.

24:49.617 --> 24:52.870
- And what if we did?
- Look, D, nobody in this city is safe

24:52.900 --> 24:54.846
with this witch Dahlia coming around.

24:54.848 --> 24:57.267
Now Klaus is off the rails,
and he won't trust anyone,

24:57.297 --> 25:01.180
and he won't share the one weapon
that will take down this witch.

25:01.182 --> 25:02.614
If things go south,

25:02.616 --> 25:04.852
that dagger might come in handy.

25:04.854 --> 25:08.131
Kol gave me that dagger for my protection.

25:08.392 --> 25:11.142
I'll be the one who
decides if it gets used.

25:12.994 --> 25:15.331
Now I have to get back to work.

25:20.505 --> 25:24.641
Your transparent attempts to
therapize me failed, brother.

25:24.643 --> 25:27.372
I suggest you allow me to
make my way home in peace.

25:27.402 --> 25:29.147
Enough with the games, Niklaus.

25:29.177 --> 25:30.912
Now is not the time.

25:31.148 --> 25:32.994
Must I beseech you to stand with us?

25:33.024 --> 25:35.383
If by "us" you mean you and Freya,

25:35.385 --> 25:37.252
then I will not be standing with you.

25:37.254 --> 25:39.718
She is the best chance we
have to save your child.

25:39.748 --> 25:42.244
Yes, Elijah, my child,

25:42.274 --> 25:44.259
which is why, although
she feigns innocence,

25:44.261 --> 25:46.038
I can't help but recall it was Freya

25:46.068 --> 25:48.329
who led our lunatic brother
Finn to the safe house,

25:48.331 --> 25:49.763
where he would have done God knows what

25:49.765 --> 25:51.085
if you had not intervened.

25:51.115 --> 25:53.868
I was a breath away from taking your life.

25:53.898 --> 25:55.238
Just a few short years ago

25:55.240 --> 25:56.604
when you broke your curse,

25:56.606 --> 25:59.273
I held your beating heart in my hand.

25:59.303 --> 26:01.076
Do you recall that, Niklaus?

26:01.078 --> 26:02.877
And yet here we are still alive,

26:02.879 --> 26:04.746
still family.

26:04.748 --> 26:06.047
Now we need her, Niklaus.

26:06.049 --> 26:07.915
Freya is our family.

26:07.917 --> 26:09.354
If you cannot see the
greater picture here...

26:09.384 --> 26:11.650
You see only around the
next curve in the road.

26:11.680 --> 26:14.125
I am looking from above.

26:14.155 --> 26:16.021
Freya gave herself away

26:16.023 --> 26:20.359
when she complained of our
single weapon to kill Dahlia.

26:20.361 --> 26:23.932
Now I know there is a way
to defeat our hated enemy

26:23.934 --> 26:25.744
- without her.
- So enlighten me,

26:25.774 --> 26:27.537
and I will do everything
in my power to help you.

26:27.567 --> 26:30.007
Forsake Freya, and I will let you in.

26:30.037 --> 26:31.371
Niklaus, this is insane.

26:31.401 --> 26:33.323
Hope is also my family.

26:33.353 --> 26:34.940
Now if you continue to walk this path,

26:34.970 --> 26:37.675
you will lead her towards harm.

26:37.705 --> 26:40.309
And do not fail to understand me
when I say this to you.

26:40.339 --> 26:42.241
I will do whatever it takes

26:42.243 --> 26:44.846
to prevent this.

26:44.848 --> 26:47.249
So will I.

26:47.481 --> 26:50.520
So the choice remains yours, brother...

26:50.522 --> 26:53.321
Freya or me.

27:07.634 --> 27:09.098
Yeah. So Davina says

27:09.128 --> 27:12.473
Hope shouldn't be able to do
any magic if she's wearing that,

27:12.603 --> 27:15.361
and... oh... to tell you good luck.

27:15.391 --> 27:17.202
You did good, Aiden.

27:17.204 --> 27:18.210
Come on.

27:18.240 --> 27:21.090
Wait. There's, uh, something
I need to, um...

27:22.143 --> 27:25.762
Look. Um, the reason you
didn't get out of the compound

27:25.792 --> 27:27.849
last night was because of me.

27:27.851 --> 27:29.283
You can't control traffic, buddy.

27:29.285 --> 27:32.860
No. I... I did it on purpose

27:33.351 --> 27:36.229
for Klaus.

27:36.231 --> 27:37.530
He sucked me in.

27:37.532 --> 27:40.818
He appealed to my stupid ego,
told me everything that I wanted to hear.

27:40.848 --> 27:43.195
Ok. Last night, he wanted
me to watch you guys.

27:43.225 --> 27:46.625
Jax, if I had let you escape,
he would have killed me...

27:51.421 --> 27:52.791
I guess I deserved that. Ahem.

27:52.821 --> 27:56.149
This thing that Klaus said that you
wanted to hear, what was it?

27:56.584 --> 27:59.878
He told me I made a good Alpha.

28:00.140 --> 28:02.581
What a joke, right?

28:03.013 --> 28:05.699
An Alpha would never turn on his pack.

28:09.445 --> 28:11.802
Neither did you in the end.

28:14.733 --> 28:18.397
All I know is that today
you risked your life

28:18.399 --> 28:21.769
for Hayley and for Hope,

28:22.193 --> 28:23.971
so you have to take my forgiveness.

28:23.973 --> 28:26.773
I don't deserve to be a part of the pack,

28:27.099 --> 28:29.408
so I'm leaving.

28:29.410 --> 28:33.881
Uh, yeah. Josh and I
are getting out of here.

28:34.198 --> 28:37.307
All right. If you need to
take some time like I did,

28:37.337 --> 28:38.548
do it,

28:38.550 --> 28:40.652
but you'll always be a
part of this pack, ok?

28:40.654 --> 28:42.998
I'm not ready to lose you yet.

28:44.087 --> 28:46.624
Jackson, uh...

28:46.626 --> 28:49.395
Just take care of yourself,

28:49.738 --> 28:53.634
you know, and watch your back with Klaus.

28:53.636 --> 28:56.156
Come here, you idiot.

28:56.940 --> 28:58.876
Ha ha ha!

29:10.299 --> 29:12.510
Of course I tried to call you, Elijah,

29:12.540 --> 29:15.699
but since Dahlia was able to take down
both Klaus and Mikael,

29:15.729 --> 29:17.897
I am guessing that a cell
phone tower was a piece of cake.

29:17.899 --> 29:19.166
And where were the wolves who stood guard?

29:19.168 --> 29:20.905
Getting their asses handed to them

29:20.907 --> 29:22.475
by Dahlia just like Klaus did.

29:22.477 --> 29:25.006
That's it. You're coming with me
to the compound.

29:25.036 --> 29:27.301
Where Dahlia sent Josephine this morning.

29:27.331 --> 29:29.926
No way. We'd be sitting ducks
just like we will be here

29:29.956 --> 29:33.093
as soon as that spell breaks,

29:33.422 --> 29:35.217
which is why we have to go.

29:35.247 --> 29:37.226
Jackson is out getting supplies,

29:37.256 --> 29:39.436
and then we're taking the wolves,
and we're headed to the bayou.

29:39.466 --> 29:43.107
The swamp, so my child can
be protected by the very wolves

29:43.137 --> 29:44.704
Dahlia so easily defeated?

29:44.706 --> 29:46.139
Absolutely not.

29:46.141 --> 29:47.679
You know, I am so over

29:47.709 --> 29:49.372
taking advice from you, Klaus.

29:49.402 --> 29:51.836
All it has done so far
is put Hope in danger.

29:51.866 --> 29:54.416
From now on, I am gonna
do what I want to do.

29:54.418 --> 29:56.321
We're leaving.

29:56.323 --> 29:58.325
You're not going anywhere
unless I tell you to.

29:58.355 --> 30:00.328
I am not your prisoner, Klaus.

30:00.330 --> 30:02.276
Both of you, please.

30:02.306 --> 30:03.868
We're playing into Dahlia's hands.

30:03.870 --> 30:07.174
Not doing as I say plays into her hands.

30:07.176 --> 30:09.846
While you two have been
kowtowing to Freya

30:09.876 --> 30:12.514
and devising ways to flee
with your tail between your legs,

30:12.544 --> 30:14.979
I've been forging a new path.

30:14.981 --> 30:17.415
I know what Freya was planning,

30:17.417 --> 30:20.298
and I know how to kill Dahlia.

30:23.510 --> 30:25.827
- Thank you.
- Sure.

30:28.264 --> 30:31.214
(Dahlia whistling melody)

30:39.372 --> 30:41.108
(Dahlia): Too bad.

30:41.138 --> 30:43.880
They were almost as young
and beautiful as you.

30:43.910 --> 30:47.546
- What are you... 
- Hello, Aiden, sweet boy.

30:47.548 --> 30:49.606
We should get started.

30:53.642 --> 30:55.987
Don't fear. This will be over quickly.

30:55.989 --> 30:57.422
Unh!

30:59.867 --> 31:01.433
You are what is known

31:01.463 --> 31:03.129
as a tipping point

31:03.131 --> 31:06.297
to set Mikaelson

31:06.299 --> 31:08.163
against Mikaelson.

31:08.193 --> 31:09.833
Aah!

31:10.439 --> 31:12.341
It is true you are a minor player,

31:12.343 --> 31:13.889
though it only takes one match

31:13.919 --> 31:15.979
to burn down acres of forest.

31:15.981 --> 31:17.623
In my plan to divide and conquer,

31:17.653 --> 31:20.863
you are the perfect kindling.

31:20.865 --> 31:23.134
Aah!

31:24.991 --> 31:27.172
Why are you doing this to me?

31:27.174 --> 31:29.273
Because...

31:29.275 --> 31:31.442
(Bones cracking)

31:33.011 --> 31:36.982
I need to make it look convincing.

32:04.256 --> 32:05.670
I promise we'll move somewhere cool

32:05.700 --> 32:07.262
so you'll want to come visit.

32:07.292 --> 32:08.960
Any preferences, like, uh,

32:08.962 --> 32:11.024
Berlin, Rio, Joberg?

32:11.054 --> 32:13.338
You know I'd go anywhere to see you.

32:14.366 --> 32:18.302
You know, I... I hate to leave
right after Kol and all.

32:18.332 --> 32:22.645
- I feel like a jerk.
- No. I... I'm glad for you guys.

32:22.675 --> 32:24.577
Really, I am. I...

32:24.579 --> 32:29.268
It'd be too depressing if one
of us didn't get a happy ending.

32:32.548 --> 32:34.571
What the...

32:37.130 --> 32:40.360
No! No!

32:40.362 --> 32:43.898
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

32:51.741 --> 32:53.342
Aiden?

32:55.177 --> 32:56.710
Aiden!

33:16.479 --> 33:18.713
(Klaus): Freya objected to
us making a single weapon

33:18.715 --> 33:20.417
because it spoilt her plan.

33:20.419 --> 33:21.853
(Jackson): Klaus!

33:21.855 --> 33:23.088
Jack?

33:23.090 --> 33:24.456
Klaus!

33:24.458 --> 33:26.208
Oh, my God!

33:27.877 --> 33:29.310
What happened?

33:29.312 --> 33:30.812
Klaus made Aiden spy on us.

33:30.814 --> 33:34.150
Instead, he told me everything,
so you killed him!

33:35.352 --> 33:36.758
(Hayley): You killed him,

33:36.788 --> 33:40.493
one of the wolves sworn
to protect our daughter?

33:48.872 --> 33:51.400
So what if I did?

33:53.343 --> 33:55.966
This is what happens to anyone

33:55.996 --> 33:57.797
who dares cross me!

33:57.799 --> 34:01.007
- Just give us the word, Jackson.
- Yes! Come and have a go,

34:01.037 --> 34:02.671
but you'll be putting
your life on the line

34:02.673 --> 34:05.676
for one who was all too
willing to betray you.

34:05.678 --> 34:07.011
Perhaps this never would have happened

34:07.013 --> 34:08.978
if he'd have had a real Alpha.

34:08.981 --> 34:10.810
Unh!

34:16.224 --> 34:17.928
Do you wish to die?

34:17.929 --> 34:19.696
(Growls)

34:19.697 --> 34:22.518
You want to kill me, too, Elijah?

34:24.418 --> 34:27.206
(Elijah): If you come at him,

34:27.208 --> 34:29.362
you come at me.

34:31.476 --> 34:34.827
You lot should make
better use of your time.

34:34.857 --> 34:36.393
I suggest burying your dead.

34:36.422 --> 34:39.134
- Get out!
- Niklaus, you mentioned a plan.

34:39.164 --> 34:42.521
I recommend you begin. Hayley and
Hope are safe for the time being.

34:42.523 --> 34:45.956
They're not going anywhere.

34:45.958 --> 34:48.257
Shan't be long.

34:52.569 --> 34:54.536
I can't believe this is happening.

34:54.538 --> 34:56.505
My brother's lost his bloody mind.

34:56.507 --> 35:00.208
You really think those wolves are
gonna fight to protect Hope now?

35:00.210 --> 35:02.945
He ruins everything he touches,

35:02.947 --> 35:05.551
turns everyone against us.

35:05.581 --> 35:07.371
(Davina): Marcel?

35:11.052 --> 35:14.698
We just heard. Is Josh with you?

35:14.728 --> 35:19.499
No. When Jackson came to get Aiden's body,

35:19.529 --> 35:21.931
he just took off.

35:21.933 --> 35:23.567
D.

35:25.901 --> 35:28.035
D, I'm so sorry.

35:39.245 --> 35:41.653
I brought something for you.

35:48.655 --> 35:52.052
Is that what I think it is?

35:52.054 --> 35:54.589
The dagger Kol and I made.

35:54.591 --> 35:56.659
I want you to use it.

35:56.661 --> 35:59.492
I want you to put Klaus down.

36:32.630 --> 36:33.967
Nice job today.

36:33.969 --> 36:35.974
First Klaus kills Aiden,
and then you defend him?

36:36.004 --> 36:37.201
I was protecting Hope.

36:37.231 --> 36:39.742
Yeah. Well, if that's
true, then what happens now?

36:39.772 --> 36:42.144
Somehow, I don't think that Klaus
is gonna be able to save us.

36:42.174 --> 36:44.243
He loves her.

36:44.640 --> 36:45.880
I love her.

36:45.882 --> 36:49.050
Well, if you do, then let us leave.

36:49.052 --> 36:52.425
If you run to the bayou,
I cannot protect you from Dahlia

36:52.455 --> 36:53.701
or Niklaus.

36:53.731 --> 36:55.697
We have a way of keeping
Hope from doing magic.

36:55.727 --> 36:57.975
Dahlia won't be able to track us down.

36:58.005 --> 37:00.169
Jackson knows every inch of the bayou.

37:00.199 --> 37:04.204
He can protect us, and I know that
Marcel will help us get out of the city.

37:04.234 --> 37:06.803
The only thing standing in our way is you.

37:06.805 --> 37:08.379
What are you asking me to do?

37:08.409 --> 37:10.242
We can't run from Dahlia

37:10.244 --> 37:13.763
and hide from Klaus at the same time.

37:14.480 --> 37:17.479
You want to protect us?

37:17.481 --> 37:19.681
Buy us some time.

37:37.411 --> 37:40.323
(Cami): Tell me you didn't do it.

37:40.353 --> 37:42.729
Tell me you didn't kill that sweet boy.

37:42.759 --> 37:44.781
- Camille...
- They said you admitted it.

37:44.811 --> 37:46.959
Then why even come here?

37:46.989 --> 37:49.022
To see for yourself,

37:49.024 --> 37:50.462
morbid curiosity,

37:50.492 --> 37:51.794
a new piece of the puzzle

37:51.796 --> 37:53.202
in your long-standing analysis

37:53.232 --> 37:55.735
of the immortal bastard?

37:56.192 --> 37:59.329
If I tell you who I am, and
you refuse to believe me,

37:59.359 --> 38:02.382
then I can hardly be blamed
for your disappointment.

38:02.412 --> 38:04.582
I wish I did believe you,

38:04.584 --> 38:06.299
and you know what? Maybe you were right,

38:06.329 --> 38:09.718
maybe about everything, even Freya.

38:09.720 --> 38:11.324
Maybe she's not what she seems.

38:11.354 --> 38:12.922
Maybe she is out to get you

38:12.924 --> 38:16.242
and twisting everyone against you,
and maybe she is this terrible person,

38:16.272 --> 38:18.936
but you know what she didn't do, Klaus?

38:18.966 --> 38:21.937
She didn't just kill Aiden.

38:21.939 --> 38:25.129
She didn't just murder an innocent guy.

38:25.159 --> 38:27.501
And neither did I!

38:35.718 --> 38:38.329
What? Why did you tell them that you did?

38:38.359 --> 38:40.865
If I have spilled Crescent blood,

38:40.895 --> 38:44.369
then Hayley will be forced to question
her pack's loyalty to Hope,

38:44.399 --> 38:45.766
and she will not run.

38:45.768 --> 38:47.435
But if they don't protect
her, then who...

38:47.437 --> 38:48.909
Only I can save her,

38:48.939 --> 38:51.376
and I need them to fear me!

38:55.147 --> 38:57.516
Am I supposed to fear you, too?

38:57.518 --> 39:01.159
It would be better for you if you did,

39:01.189 --> 39:05.271
for you to believe I am the monster
they would paint me as.

39:06.695 --> 39:10.072
And then one day when
all of this was past,

39:10.102 --> 39:11.769
I might find you

39:11.771 --> 39:14.538
and profess my innocence,

39:14.540 --> 39:18.675
and because you are you,
you would believe me,

39:18.677 --> 39:21.981
and we would pass a perfect afternoon

39:21.983 --> 39:25.081
in a corner cafe together.

39:28.724 --> 39:31.822
And I would wish for nothing more.

39:37.134 --> 39:40.069
A better man would
protect you with that lie,

39:40.071 --> 39:42.682
but I am not that man...

39:44.466 --> 39:47.284
And so I leave you with
the burden of a truth

39:47.314 --> 39:49.551
that no one will believe.

40:01.827 --> 40:04.558
(Footsteps)

40:12.985 --> 40:15.284
You put them in the paint...

40:15.537 --> 40:18.895
father's ashes,

40:19.317 --> 40:22.420
the earth from sacred ground,
all hidden in plain sight.

40:22.450 --> 40:24.283
What are you doing here?

40:24.285 --> 40:25.985
You're supposed to be guarding Hayley.

40:26.015 --> 40:29.091
She's gone.

40:29.093 --> 40:33.671
She and Jackson took Hope,
and you will not find them, brother.

40:34.978 --> 40:38.699
You helped Hayley escape

40:38.701 --> 40:39.952
with my daughter.

40:39.982 --> 40:43.406
Well, someone had to protect that child.

40:43.436 --> 40:45.240
How dare you!

40:51.611 --> 40:53.082
I'm a hybrid, Elijah.

40:53.112 --> 40:56.044
Why provoke a fight you cannot win?

40:56.046 --> 40:57.943
Unh!

41:04.255 --> 41:06.222
For Hope.

41:09.372 --> 41:11.885
(Footsteps)

41:32.647 --> 41:36.243
(Church bells playing Dahlia's melody)

41:47.503 --> 41:50.465
(Melody continues)
