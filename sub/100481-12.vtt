00:53.101 --> 00:54.469
WERE ARRESTED FOR FLOUTING

00:54.535 --> 00:56.404
LOCKDOWN RULES, MORE THAN 20 OF

00:56.471 --> 00:57.872
THEM IN ALL.

00:57.939 --> 00:59.307
THEY WERE TAKEN TO A LOCAL

01:00.375 --> 01:00.975
CAUGHT HOLDING A MOTHER'S DAY

01:08.049 --> 01:09.183
AND SECOND, YOU HAVE GOT TO

01:09.250 --> 01:10.718
ADMIRE THE PEOPLE WHO KEPT THE

01:10.785 --> 01:11.619
HEADS OF THEIR COSTUMES ON WHILE

01:11.686 --> 01:12.887
BEING ARRESTED.

01:12.954 --> 01:13.755
THAT IS SOME SERIOUS COMMITMENT

01:13.821 --> 01:16.190
TO STAYING IN CHARACTER.

01:16.257 --> 01:17.492
WHOEVER'S INSIDE OF THAT COSTUME

01:17.558 --> 01:18.559

01:18.626 --> 01:21.129
PERUVIAN TWEETY BIRDS.

01:21.195 --> 01:22.764

UNITED STATES, THIS WEEK SAW

01:23.965 --> 01:24.799

01:29.170 --> 01:30.471
DESCRIBED MISSED OPPORTUNITIES,

01:30.538 --> 01:32.273
SUCH AS THIS MOMENT IN JANUARY,

01:32.340 --> 01:33.574
WHEN A MANUFACTURER OF PPE TRIED

01:33.641 --> 01:35.109
TO SOUND AN ALARM.

01:35.176 --> 01:36.944
>> I'LL NEVER FORGET THE EMAILS

01:37.011 --> 01:38.913
I RECEIVED FROM MIKE BOWEN

01:38.980 --> 01:43.651
INDICATING THAT OUR MASK

01:43.718 --> 01:44.752
SUPPLIER, N95 RESPIRATOR

01:44.819 --> 01:46.220
SUPPLIER, WAS COMPLETELY

01:46.287 --> 01:48.556
DECIMATED.

01:48.623 --> 01:50.158
AND HE SAID,

01:50.224 --> 01:51.225
"WE'RE IN DEEP SHIT.

01:51.292 --> 01:52.193
THE WORLD IS.

01:52.260 --> 01:53.361
AND WE NEED TO ACT."

01:53.428 --> 01:59.434
>> John: YEAH.

01:59.500 --> 02:00.835
IT SEEMS THAT'S WHAT

02:00.902 --> 02:01.502
CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY IS NOW.

02:01.569 --> 02:02.036
JUST CAREER PUBLIC HEALTH

02:02.103 --> 02:02.704
OFFICIALS SAYING, ON RECORD,

02:02.770 --> 02:03.571
"SHIT'S FUCKED, MOTHERFUCKERS!"

IT FEELS LIKE, AS TIME GOES ON,

02:06.441 --> 02:07.275
WE'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT MORE

02:07.342 --> 02:08.242
CLEAR WARNING SIGNS THE TRUMP

02:08.309 --> 02:09.610
ADMINISTRATION FLAT‐OUT IGNORED.

02:09.677 --> 02:10.211
I'M ASSUMING WE'LL EVENTUALLY

02:10.278 --> 02:11.245
LEARN TRUMP WAS PERSONALLY

02:11.312 --> 02:12.780
DELIVERED A REPORT IN JANUARY

02:12.847 --> 02:13.948
TITLED "WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN

02:14.015 --> 02:15.850
YOU'RE EXPECTING THE CORONAVIRUS

02:15.917 --> 02:16.484
TO KILL 80,000 AMERICANS IN FOUR

02:16.551 --> 02:18.086
MONTHS."

02:18.152 --> 02:19.620
AND WHILE YOU'D EXPECT THE

02:19.687 --> 02:21.789
PRESIDENT TO BE LASER‐FOCUSED ON

02:21.856 --> 02:23.057
THIS PANDEMIC AND NOTHING ELSE,

02:23.124 --> 02:24.459
HE TOOK A BREAK ON FRIDAY TO

02:24.525 --> 02:26.094
UNVEIL THE NEW SPACE FORCE FLAG

02:26.160 --> 02:28.496
AND DO A LITTLE BRAGGING.

02:28.563 --> 02:31.933
>> THE PRESIDENT WAS TOUTING

02:31.999 --> 02:32.667
OTHER POTENTIAL ADVANCES, LIKE A

02:32.734 --> 02:33.368
HIGH‐SPEED MISSILE FOR

02:33.434 --> 02:34.135
MR. TRUMP'S PET PROJECT,

02:34.202 --> 02:37.772
THE SPACE FORCE.

02:37.839 --> 02:38.439
>> I CALL IT THE SUPER‐DUPER

02:38.506 --> 02:39.006
MISSILE.

02:39.073 --> 02:40.808
SPACE IS GOING TO BE, UH ‐‐

02:40.875 --> 02:41.409
IT'S GONNA TO BE THE FUTURE.

02:41.476 --> 02:43.845
WE'RE NOW THE LEADER IN SPACE.

02:43.911 --> 02:44.679
>> John: YEP, THAT HAPPENED.

02:44.746 --> 02:45.880
DONALD TRUMP POSED WITH A

02:45.947 --> 02:47.215
GIGANTIC SPACE FORCE FLAG WHILE

02:47.281 --> 02:48.416
STANDING WAY TOO CLOSE TO

02:48.483 --> 02:53.354
SOMEONE, REFERRED TO A

02:53.421 --> 02:56.391
"SUPER‐DUPER MISSILE," AND

02:56.457 --> 02:56.824
CALLED THE U. S.

02:56.891 --> 02:57.358
"THE LEADER IN SPACE."

02:57.425 --> 02:58.059
HE TRULY HAS THE SPIRIT, BRAIN,

02:58.126 --> 02:58.726
APPETITE, TEMPER, PATIENCE, AND

02:58.793 --> 02:59.627
WIT OF A CHILD THAT YOU HATE.

02:59.694 --> 03:00.595
THERE'S ALSO BEEN A MAJOR

03:00.661 --> 03:01.229
SCANDAL BREWING IN WASHINGTON

03:01.295 --> 03:02.029
SURROUNDING NORTH CAROLINA

03:02.096 --> 03:03.030
SENATOR AND CHAIR OF THE

03:03.097 --> 03:03.998
SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE

03:04.065 --> 03:05.500
RICHARD BURR.

03:05.566 --> 03:06.434
AND IT KICKED UP A NOTCH ON

03:06.501 --> 03:07.101
WEDNESDAY WITH A STARTLING

03:07.168 --> 03:08.903
DEVELOPMENT.

03:08.970 --> 03:10.238
>> LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS

03:10.304 --> 03:11.406
SAY THE FBI SERVED A

03:11.472 --> 03:12.907
SEARCH WARRANT WEDNESDAY NIGHT

03:12.974 --> 03:14.142
AT SENATOR BURR'S HOME.

03:14.208 --> 03:15.543
THEY SAY IT WAS PART OF AN

03:15.610 --> 03:16.844
INVESTIGATION INTO STOCK SALES

03:16.911 --> 03:18.813
RELATED TO THE CORONAVIRUS.

03:18.880 --> 03:19.981
THE OFFICIALS SAY BURR HANDED

03:20.047 --> 03:21.382
OVER A CELL PHONE TO THE AGENTS

03:21.449 --> 03:22.817
AT HIS HOME IN WASHINGTON.

03:22.884 --> 03:24.585
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

03:24.652 --> 03:26.120
THE FBI SEIZED BURR'S CELL PHONE

03:26.187 --> 03:27.655
ON SUSPICION HE MAY'VE USED

03:27.722 --> 03:28.623
NON‐PUBLIC INFORMATION FROM

03:28.689 --> 03:29.424
CORONAVIRUS BRIEFINGS TO DUMP

03:29.490 --> 03:30.391
SHARES AHEAD OF THE MARKET

03:30.458 --> 03:31.526
CRASH.

03:31.592 --> 03:34.295
WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, IS A

03:34.362 --> 03:35.730
REMINDER THAT, AT ANY MOMENT,

03:35.797 --> 03:37.031
THE FBI COULD BARGE INTO YOUR

03:37.098 --> 03:38.433
HOUSE AND CONFISCATE YOUR PHONE.

03:38.499 --> 03:39.267
SO IF THE PHOTO ON YOUR PHONE'S

03:39.333 --> 03:40.301
HOME SCREEN IS SOMETHING YOU

03:40.368 --> 03:45.006
DON'T WANT THE FBI TO SEE ‐‐

03:45.072 --> 03:46.474
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, LET'S SAY A

03:46.541 --> 03:47.141
VERY TASTEFUL IMAGE OF A HAMSTER

03:47.208 --> 03:47.775
IN A SPEEDO ‐‐ YOU SHOULD CHANGE

03:47.842 --> 03:48.342
IT IMMEDIATELY.

03:48.409 --> 03:50.578
THERE'S NOTHING ILLEGAL ABOUT

03:50.645 --> 03:51.212
THAT PARTICULAR EXAMPLE, BY THE

03:51.279 --> 03:51.746
WAY.

03:51.813 --> 03:52.380
THAT'S JUST SOMETHING I RANDOMLY

03:52.447 --> 03:53.080
THOUGHT OF.

03:53.147 --> 03:53.681
AND, ON A COMPLETELY UNRELATED

03:53.748 --> 03:54.415
NOTE, I JUST HAVE TO DO

03:54.482 --> 03:58.119
SOMETHING REAL QUICK.

03:58.186 --> 03:59.821
AND BYE‐BYE, BUDDY.

03:59.887 --> 04:00.455
GOOD.

04:00.521 --> 04:01.355
OKAY, BACK TO RICHARD BURR.

04:01.422 --> 04:01.989
THE DETAILS HERE DON'T LOOK

04:02.056 --> 04:03.157
PARTICULARLY GOOD FOR HIM.

04:03.224 --> 04:03.825
>> BEFORE THE MARKET TUMBLED,

04:03.891 --> 04:04.892
BURR AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE

04:04.959 --> 04:06.327
SENATE WERE TOLD IN A FEBRUARY

04:06.394 --> 04:07.495
BRIEFING ABOUT THE POTENTIAL

04:07.562 --> 04:10.698
IMPACT OF THE CRISIS TO COME.

04:10.765 --> 04:12.867
A DAY AFTER, BURR SOLD UP TO

04:12.934 --> 04:14.235
$1.7 MILLION IN STOCK, INCLUDING

04:14.302 --> 04:15.436
SHARES IN THE TRAVEL AND HOTEL

04:15.503 --> 04:17.805
INDUSTRY.

04:17.872 --> 04:19.640
>> John: THAT IS PRETTY DAMNING.

04:19.707 --> 04:21.676
THE ONLY WAY THAT COULD HAVE

04:21.742 --> 04:22.743
BEEN ANY SHADIER IS IF BURR THEN

04:22.810 --> 04:23.644
BOUGHT A TON OF SHARES IN THE

04:23.711 --> 04:25.580
ACTUAL CORONAVIRUS.

04:25.646 --> 04:27.348
NOW, BURR STAUNCHLY MAINTAINS

04:27.415 --> 04:29.484
THAT HE DID NOTHING WRONG HERE,

04:29.550 --> 04:39.260
BASING HIS SALES SOLELY ON NEWS

04:39.327 --> 04:39.994
REPORTS AT THE TIME, AND YOU

04:40.061 --> 04:40.461
KNOW WHAT?

04:40.528 --> 04:40.928
SURE.

04:40.995 --> 04:41.696
BUT THERE ARE THINGS IN BURR'S

04:41.762 --> 04:42.263
PAST THAT ARE INHERENTLY

04:42.330 --> 04:42.830
SUSPICIOUS.

04:42.897 --> 04:43.431
FOR ONE THING, THERE WAS HIS

04:43.498 --> 04:44.065
POSITION ON THE STOCK ACT, WHICH

04:44.131 --> 04:44.699
FORBIDS MEMBERS OF CONGRESS FROM

04:44.765 --> 04:45.333
TRADING ON NONPUBLIC INFORMATION

04:45.399 --> 04:45.967
THEY LEARN ON THE JOB.

04:46.033 --> 04:46.667
BURR WAS ONE OF ONLY THREE

04:46.734 --> 04:47.301
SENATORS TO VOTE AGAINST THAT

04:47.368 --> 04:48.035
LEGISLATION.

04:48.102 --> 04:48.903
AND IN TERMS OF OUTRIGHT

04:48.970 --> 04:49.937
CHARACTER FLAWS, THERE'S ALSO

04:50.004 --> 04:51.606
THE FACT THAT APPARENTLY, HE

04:51.672 --> 04:53.975
NEVER WEARS SOCKS, WHICH IS NOT

04:54.041 --> 04:56.244
JUST COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE, IT

04:56.310 --> 04:56.844
SEEMS LIKE IT'S SOMETHING HE'S

04:56.911 --> 04:57.812
ACTIVELY PROUD OF.

04:57.879 --> 04:58.946
>> WHAT IS YOUR POSITION ON

04:59.013 --> 04:59.847
SOCKS?

04:59.914 --> 05:01.983
>> OH, LISTEN, I'M NOT OPPOSED.

05:02.049 --> 05:02.817
WE'VE MANUFACTURED A LOT OF

05:02.884 --> 05:03.818
SOCKS IN NORTH CAROLINA, I JUST

05:03.885 --> 05:07.188
CHOOSE NOT TO WEAR THEM.

05:07.255 --> 05:07.788
AND IT'S ‐‐ IT'S A SOUTHERN

05:07.855 --> 05:08.489
THING.

05:08.556 --> 05:09.290
IT'S A CULTURAL THING.

05:09.357 --> 05:11.292
>> John: WHAT?

05:11.359 --> 05:12.693
GOING FOOT‐COMMANDO ISN'T A

05:12.760 --> 05:14.395
SOUTHERN CULTURAL THING.

05:14.462 --> 05:15.863
JUST BECAUSE YOU CHOOSE TO DO

05:15.930 --> 05:19.066
SOMETHING AND YOU'RE FROM THE

05:19.133 --> 05:19.667
SOUTH DOES NOT MEAN EVERYONE

05:19.734 --> 05:20.334
THERE DOES IT.

05:20.401 --> 05:21.669
NOT WEARING SOCKS ISN'T A

05:21.736 --> 05:23.070
SOUTHERN THING ANY MORE THAN

05:23.137 --> 05:23.838
WEARING SOCKS ON YOUR PENIS IS A

05:23.905 --> 05:28.109
WEST COAST THING.

05:28.175 --> 05:29.410
NOT, IT'S VERY PARTICULARLY

05:29.477 --> 05:30.244
A RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS THING.

05:30.311 --> 05:30.845
SO IT SEEMS BURR HAS FOUND

05:30.912 --> 05:31.746
HIMSELF IN A SITUATION THAT'S

05:31.812 --> 05:32.713
NOT UNLIKE THAT OF THE FEDERAL

05:32.780 --> 05:33.614
GOVERNMENT.

05:33.681 --> 05:34.549
HE GOT INFORMATION ABOUT THE

05:34.615 --> 05:35.850
CORONAVIRUS EARLY, THERE ARE

05:35.917 --> 05:36.984
LOTS OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HE

05:37.051 --> 05:39.220
DID WITH IT, AND NOW HE IS, IF I

05:39.287 --> 05:41.122
MAY QUOTE THE TESTIMONY OF A

05:41.188 --> 05:42.490
VERY TIRED PUBLIC HEALTH

05:42.557 --> 05:44.125
OFFICIAL, "IN DEEP SHIT."

05:44.191 --> 05:49.797
AND NOW THIS.

05:49.864 --> 05:51.766
>> Announcer: AND NOW,

05:51.832 --> 05:52.767
RACHAEL RAY IS DOING HER BEST

05:52.833 --> 05:54.569
WITH HER NEW ONE‐MAN PRODUCTION

05:54.635 --> 05:56.804
CREW.

05:56.871 --> 05:59.941
>> MY HUSBAND JOHN CUSIMANO,

06:00.007 --> 06:02.143
WAVE, HONEY, HE IS OUR CAMERAMAN

06:02.209 --> 06:03.844
AND DIRECTOR, IT'S GOING TO GO

06:03.911 --> 06:04.845
STRAIGHT TO HIS HEAD.

06:04.912 --> 06:06.347
>> WHAT IS THE THING WHEN YOU GO

06:06.414 --> 06:08.115
TO THE GREEK RESTAURANT AND A

06:08.182 --> 06:09.483
SET THAT SHE IS ON FIRE?

06:09.550 --> 06:12.253
>> OH, WELL, WE ARE NOT DOING

06:12.320 --> 06:13.120
THAT.

06:13.187 --> 06:14.789
COULD ALSO MAKE A FLANK STEAK.

06:14.855 --> 06:18.492
>> LITERALLY, TWO HOURS.

06:18.559 --> 06:20.127
>> IT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE

06:20.194 --> 06:22.430
SHOW AND YOU ARE ALREADY SCARING

06:22.496 --> 06:23.764
PEOPLE.

06:23.831 --> 06:25.166
>> SORRY, HONEY.

06:25.232 --> 06:28.336
>> DON'T BE SO IMPATIENT.

06:28.402 --> 06:29.337
OH, EXCUSE ME.

06:29.403 --> 06:31.172
>> HERE'S OUR CHICKEN.

06:31.238 --> 06:33.608
DID YOU SEE THAT?

06:33.674 --> 06:35.009
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL, JOHN?

06:35.076 --> 06:39.513
>> THIS IS ACTUALLY MADE FROM

06:39.580 --> 06:39.880
OYSTERS, RIGHT?

06:39.947 --> 06:42.550
>> AS ADVERTISED, JOHN.

06:42.617 --> 06:44.318
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:44.385 --> 06:45.720
SPEAK UP MAKING A MESS.

06:45.786 --> 06:46.988
>> IT'S LIKE A SQUIRREL CAME IN

06:47.054 --> 06:50.558
TO COCKTAIL.

06:50.625 --> 06:54.161
ANYWAY, MOVING ALONG, YOU'RE

06:54.228 --> 06:56.797
ALWAYS FULL ‐‐

06:56.864 --> 06:59.734
DATE NIGHT, THIS IS SO FUN.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.902
LIKE, IT'S SUPPOSED TO LOOK

07:01.969 --> 07:03.904
DIRTY.

07:03.971 --> 07:06.073
>> THIS IS WHY I TRY NOT TO PICK

07:06.140 --> 07:13.314
A FIGHT WITH RACHAEL.

07:13.381 --> 07:13.981
>> John: MOVING ON.

07:14.048 --> 07:14.949
OUR MAIN STORY CONCERNS SPORTS,

07:15.016 --> 07:15.683
THE THING O. J. SIMPSON USED TO

07:15.750 --> 07:16.183
BE FAMOUS FOR.

07:16.250 --> 07:16.784
THE CORONAVIRUS HAS TAKEN ITS

07:16.851 --> 07:17.451
TOLL ON ALL MANNER OF

07:17.518 --> 07:18.052
INDUSTRIES, BUT THE WORLD OF

07:18.119 --> 07:18.786
SPORTS WAS AMONG THOSE HIT

07:18.853 --> 07:19.387
HARDEST, EARLIEST, AND PERHAPS

07:19.453 --> 07:21.322
MOST VISIBLY, BECAUSE JUST THINK

07:21.389 --> 07:22.790
BACK TO THE DAY YOU FIRST

07:22.857 --> 07:23.924
REALIZED OUR LIVES WERE GOING TO

07:23.991 --> 07:24.825
FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE FOR A

07:24.892 --> 07:25.159
WHILE.

07:25.226 --> 07:26.327
FOR MANY, IT WAS WHEN THIS

07:26.394 --> 07:27.762
HAPPENED:

07:27.828 --> 07:29.530
>> TWO DAYS BEFORE HE TESTED

07:29.597 --> 07:31.365
POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS,

07:31.432 --> 07:33.134
UTAH JAZZ ALL‐STAR RUDY GOBERT

07:33.200 --> 07:34.969
DID THIS TO REPORTERS'

07:35.036 --> 07:38.773
MICROPHONES IN AN INTERVIEW.

07:38.839 --> 07:40.508
AND THIS MORNING, THE NBA

07:40.574 --> 07:42.076
SUSPENDING THE REST OF ITS

07:42.143 --> 07:43.144
SEASON, THE UNPRECEDENTED MOVE

07:43.210 --> 07:47.548
SHOCKING EVERYONE, INCLUDING

07:47.615 --> 07:48.482
DALLAS MAVS OWNER MARC CUBAN.

07:48.549 --> 07:49.383
>> John: JUST THINK ABOUT HOW

07:49.450 --> 07:50.017
ASTONISHING SOMETHING HAS TO BE

07:50.084 --> 07:51.619
TO SHOCK MARC CUBAN.

07:51.686 --> 07:52.987
KEEP IN MIND, HE'S ONE OF THE

07:53.054 --> 07:54.622
SHARKS ON "SHARK TANK."

07:54.689 --> 07:55.589
HE'S BEEN PITCHED BUSINESSES

07:55.656 --> 07:56.857
LIKE RENT‐A‐GOAT, A SERVICE THAT

07:56.924 --> 07:58.292
RENTS OUT GOATS TO EAT OVERGROWN

07:58.359 --> 07:59.794
SHRUBS; SQUIRREL BOSS, A

07:59.860 --> 08:01.295
BIRD FEEDER THAT GIVES ELECTRIC

08:01.362 --> 08:02.396
SHOCKS TO SQUIRRELS; AND

08:02.463 --> 08:03.864
ELEPHANT CHAT, A LITERAL STUFFED

08:03.931 --> 08:05.232
ELEPHANT THAT YOU PUT IN THE

08:05.299 --> 08:06.100
ROOM TO SIGNAL THAT THERE'S

08:06.167 --> 08:06.734
SOMETHING UNCOMFORTABLE TO TALK

08:06.801 --> 08:08.102
ABOUT.

08:08.169 --> 08:10.638
MARC CUBAN HAS ALREADY SEEN THE

08:10.705 --> 08:12.006
MOST JAW‐DROPPING, INCONCEIVABLE

08:12.073 --> 08:14.875
THINGS THIS WORLD HAS TO OFFER.

08:14.942 --> 08:19.346
AND IT WASN'T JUST BASKETBALL

08:19.413 --> 08:19.880
VANISHING SUDDENTLY.

08:19.947 --> 08:20.648
SINCE THEN, THE NHL

08:20.715 --> 08:21.315
HAS SUSPENDED ITS SEASON,

08:21.382 --> 08:21.882
MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL PUSHED

08:21.949 --> 08:22.850
BACK ITS OPENING DAY TO AN

08:22.917 --> 08:23.484
UNKNOWN DATE, INTERNATIONAL

08:23.551 --> 08:24.852
SOCCER LEAGUES SUSPENDED GAMES,

08:24.919 --> 08:25.486
AND THE OLYMPICS WERE MOVED TO

08:25.553 --> 08:26.320
NEXT SUMMER.

08:26.387 --> 08:27.354
AND AS SHOCKING AS THESE

08:27.421 --> 08:28.756
CANCELLATIONS SEEMED AT THE

08:28.823 --> 08:30.091
TIME, THE TRUTH IS, THERE WAS

08:30.157 --> 08:31.492
REALLY NO CHOICE.

08:31.559 --> 08:33.227
SPORTING EVENTS WITH LARGE

08:33.294 --> 08:34.595
CROWDS PACKED TOGETHER ARE THE

08:34.662 --> 08:36.430
EXACT OPPOSITE OF SOCIAL

08:36.497 --> 08:38.866
DISTANCING AND ARE A NIGHTMARE

08:38.933 --> 08:41.569
SCENARIO DURING A PANDEMIC.

08:41.635 --> 08:42.703
THIS CHAMPIONS LEAGUE MATCH IN

08:42.770 --> 08:44.672
MILAN IN FEBRUARY WAS LATER

08:44.739 --> 08:45.740
LIKENED TO A "BIOLOGICAL BOMB"

08:45.806 --> 08:47.108
AFTER IT WAS LINKED TO ONE OF

08:47.174 --> 08:48.976
THE DEADLIEST OUTBREAKS.

08:49.043 --> 08:50.111
BUT THOUGH SPORTS SHUTTING DOWN

08:50.177 --> 08:51.278
WAS EMPHATICALLY THE RIGHT THING

08:51.345 --> 08:52.646
TO DO, PEOPLE HAVE INCREASINGLY

08:52.713 --> 08:53.848
BEEN ASKING WHEN THEY CAN

08:53.914 --> 08:54.815
RETURN.

08:54.882 --> 08:56.350
AND FEW HAVE ASKED LOUDER THAN

08:56.417 --> 08:57.218
THIS GUY:

08:57.284 --> 08:59.220
>> I HOPE FOOTBALL CAN START.

08:59.286 --> 09:00.287
AND I TOLD THEM, "I THINK YOU

09:00.354 --> 09:01.789
MIGHT BE ABLE TO."

09:01.856 --> 09:05.359
THEY MAY VERY WELL BE ABLE TO.

09:05.426 --> 09:07.261
I HOPE THEY CAN START, AND I

09:07.328 --> 09:08.996
HOPE THEY CAN START WITH PEOPLE

09:09.063 --> 09:09.330
IN THE STANDS.

09:09.396 --> 09:09.930
THE FANS WANT TO BE BACK TOO.

09:09.997 --> 09:10.498
YOU KNOW, THEY WANT TO SEE

09:10.564 --> 09:11.065
BASKETBALL AND BASEBALL AND

09:11.132 --> 09:11.665
FOOTBALL AND HOCKEY.

09:11.732 --> 09:12.867
THEY WANT TO SEE THEIR SPORTS.

09:12.933 --> 09:14.435
WE HAVE TO GET OUR SPORTS BACK.

09:14.502 --> 09:15.035
I'M TIRED OF WATCHING BASEBALL

09:15.102 --> 09:17.438
GAMES THAT ARE 14 YEARS OLD.

09:17.505 --> 09:18.672
BUT I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY HAD TOO

09:18.739 --> 09:21.542
MUCH TIME TO WATCH.

09:21.609 --> 09:22.476
I WOULD SAY MAYBE I WATCH ONE

09:22.543 --> 09:23.577
BATTER AND THEN I GET BACK TO

09:23.644 --> 09:24.979
WORK.

09:25.045 --> 09:28.282
>> John: OKAY, BUT HERE'S THE

09:28.349 --> 09:31.185
THING: WE ACTUALLY ASKED SOME

09:31.252 --> 09:31.886
EXPERTS ABOUT THAT,

09:31.952 --> 09:32.720
AND IT TURNS OUT THAT WHEN THE

09:32.787 --> 09:33.287
COUNTRY'S IN THE MIDDLE OF A

09:33.354 --> 09:33.788
PANDEMIC THAT'S KILLING

09:33.854 --> 09:34.355
THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS EVERY

09:34.421 --> 09:34.989
SINGLE DAY, THE CORRECT NUMBER

09:35.055 --> 09:35.990
OF BATTERS FROM 2006 FOR THE

09:36.056 --> 09:38.092
PRESIDENT TO BE WATCHING IS

09:38.159 --> 09:39.727
ACTUALLY FUCKING ZERO.

09:39.794 --> 09:43.264
BUT LOOK, HE'S NOT ENTIRELY

09:43.330 --> 09:44.165
WRONG THERE.

09:44.231 --> 09:45.132
THE LACK OF SPORTS IS

09:45.199 --> 09:45.733
AN EMOTIONAL BLOW TO A LOT OF

09:45.800 --> 09:46.133
PEOPLE.

09:46.200 --> 09:46.901
AND IT'S NOT JUST EMOTIONAL ‐‐

09:46.967 --> 09:47.835
IT'S ALSO FINANCIAL.

09:47.902 --> 09:48.969
BY ONE ESTIMATE, THE SUDDEN

09:49.036 --> 09:50.905
DISAPPEARANCE OF SPORTS WILL

09:50.971 --> 09:52.239
ERASE AT LEAST $12 BILLION IN

09:52.306 --> 09:53.607
REVENUES AND HUNDREDS OF

09:53.674 --> 09:54.475
THOUSANDS OF JOBS IN THIS

09:54.542 --> 09:56.310
COUNTRY ALONE.

09:56.377 --> 09:58.012
AND THOSE JOBS AREN'T JUST THE

09:58.078 --> 10:02.817
HIGH‐PAID ATHLETES PLAYING THE

10:02.883 --> 10:04.385
GAMES ‐‐ THEY ALSO INCLUDE THE

10:04.451 --> 10:05.953
MANY PEOPLE WHO COUNT ON

10:06.020 --> 10:07.054
SPORTING EVENTS FOR EMPLOYMENT,

10:07.121 --> 10:08.656
LIKE THESE TWO PHILADELPHIA

10:08.722 --> 10:09.023
STADIUM WORKERS:

10:09.089 --> 10:09.790
>> MARVIN SPRATLEY MADE $14 AN

10:09.857 --> 10:10.958
HOUR AS A PART‐TIME GRILL COOK

10:11.025 --> 10:15.129
FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS AT

10:15.196 --> 10:15.830
SIXERS, FLYERS, AND EAGLES

10:15.896 --> 10:16.597
GAMES.

10:16.664 --> 10:18.332
>> IT'S A LOT OF STRESS ON ME.

10:18.399 --> 10:19.166
A LOT OF STRESS BECAUSE I GOT

10:19.233 --> 10:20.100
BILLS PILING UP, BABY NEEDS

10:20.167 --> 10:21.101
PAMPERS.

10:21.168 --> 10:22.203
>> AISHA JOHNSON IS A

10:22.269 --> 10:22.970
MAINTENANCE WORKER AT PHILLIES

10:23.037 --> 10:24.205
GAMES.

10:24.271 --> 10:26.473
>> I HAVE FOOD ON THE TABLE NOW.

10:26.540 --> 10:27.341
I'M MAKING IT RIGHT AT THIS

10:27.408 --> 10:28.576
MOMENT, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT

10:28.642 --> 10:31.145
TOMORROW MAY BRING.

10:31.212 --> 10:32.479
>> John: YEAH, THAT'S REALLY

10:32.546 --> 10:33.113
DIFFICULT.

10:33.180 --> 10:34.515
AND IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING THAT,

10:34.582 --> 10:35.516
ALTHOUGH PHILADELPHIA SPORTS

10:35.583 --> 10:36.750
FANS ARE A HORDE OF INHUMAN

10:36.817 --> 10:38.085
MONSTERS WHO DESERVE NEITHER

10:38.152 --> 10:39.186
SYMPATHY NOR UNDERSTANDING, THE

10:39.253 --> 10:40.321
PEOPLE PAID TO TEND TO THOSE

10:40.387 --> 10:41.622
MONSTERS REALLY DEPEND ON THEIR

10:41.689 --> 10:44.258
MONSTER MONEY.

10:44.325 --> 10:45.593
SO GIVEN THAT THE ABSENCE OF

10:45.659 --> 10:48.229
SPORT HAS CAUSED SUCH PAIN, WE

10:48.295 --> 10:48.963
THOUGHT TONIGHT WE'D TAKE A

10:49.029 --> 10:50.130
LOOK AT WHAT SPORTS HAVE BECOME

10:50.197 --> 10:51.198
IN THE AGE OF CORONAVIRUS AND

10:51.265 --> 10:52.366
WHAT A PATH BACK FOR THEM MIGHT

10:52.433 --> 10:53.567
LOOK LIKE.

10:53.634 --> 10:54.735
AND FIRST, LET ME SAY THAT THE

10:54.802 --> 10:55.436
SPORTS WORLD HAS BEEN DOING SOME

10:55.502 --> 10:57.137
TRULY GREAT THINGS DURING THE

10:57.204 --> 10:58.172
PANDEMIC.

10:58.239 --> 10:59.373
TEAMS AND ATHLETES HAVE BEEN

10:59.440 --> 11:00.941
DONATING AND RAISING MONEY FOR

11:01.008 --> 11:02.142
CHARITY, WITH SOME EVEN SELLING

11:02.209 --> 11:02.810
BRANDED FACE MASKS FOR

11:02.877 --> 11:04.979
CORONAVIRUS‐RELATED CAUSES.

11:05.045 --> 11:06.413
AND DESPITE NOT BEING ABLE TO

11:06.480 --> 11:07.948
PLAY, TEAMS HAVE FOUND WAYS TO

11:08.015 --> 11:09.283
STAY ENGAGED WITH THEIR FANS

11:09.350 --> 11:11.619
WHILE MODELING SOCIAL

11:11.685 --> 11:13.220
DISTANCING.

11:13.287 --> 11:14.722
THE PITTSBURGH PIRATES PARROT

11:14.788 --> 11:16.523
POSTED AN AT‐HOME WORKOUT VIDEO;

11:16.590 --> 11:21.028
THE CHICAGO BLACKHAWKS MASCOT,

11:21.095 --> 11:21.795
TOMMY HAWK, VACUUMED HIS

11:21.862 --> 11:22.830
APARTMENT; AND GRITTY ONCE AGAIN

11:22.897 --> 11:23.464
BLEW THEM ALL AWAY WITHOUT EVEN

TRYING:

11:32.439 --> 11:38.212

11:38.279 --> 11:40.314
>> John: OKAY, I DON'T KNOW

11:40.381 --> 11:41.515
WHAT'S MORE AMAZING THERE:

11:41.582 --> 11:42.683
GRITTY'S INCREDIBLE HAND‐EYE

11:42.750 --> 11:44.351
COORDINATION, THE FACT HE SEEMS

11:44.418 --> 11:45.753
TO LIVE IN AN ENTIRELY EMPTY

11:45.819 --> 11:47.521
APARTMENT, OR THE DISCOVERY THAT

11:47.588 --> 11:49.356
HIS BODY OCCASIONALLY SQUEAKS

11:49.423 --> 11:50.591
WHEN IT MOVES, PRESUMABLY

11:50.658 --> 11:51.892
BECAUSE, EVOLUTIONARILY

11:51.959 --> 11:53.861
SPEAKING, GRITTY'S CLOSEST

11:53.928 --> 11:55.629
RELATIVE IS A USED DOG TOY.

11:55.696 --> 11:57.364
AND IT'S NOT JUST MASCOTS ‐‐

11:57.431 --> 11:58.165
ATHLETES HAVE BEEN SHOWING HOW

11:58.232 --> 11:59.266
THEY'RE TRYING TO WORK FROM

11:59.333 --> 12:00.467
HOME, WHICH HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN

12:00.534 --> 12:01.769
EASY.

12:01.835 --> 12:04.004
FOR INSTANCE, REIGNING NBA MVP

12:04.071 --> 12:05.773
GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO TOLD

12:05.839 --> 12:06.941

12:08.309 --> 12:09.576
HE DOESN'T HAVE A HOOP AT HIS

12:09.643 --> 12:10.744
HOUSE.

12:10.811 --> 12:12.212
OTHERS HAVE HAD TO GET PRETTY

12:12.279 --> 12:13.847
CREATIVE TO CONTINUE THEIR

12:13.914 --> 12:14.782
TRAINING, WHETHER IT'S AN

UTTERLY DELIGHTED BY THE

12:27.995 --> 12:29.797
SITUATION.

12:29.863 --> 12:31.665

12:53.087 --> 12:55.189
YEAH.

12:57.658 --> 13:01.495

13:01.562 --> 13:02.863
FIXED AND I'D JUST MAKE HIM

13:02.930 --> 13:04.131
EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED EVERY TIME

13:04.198 --> 13:04.732
SOMEONE CAME OVER.

13:04.798 --> 13:05.332
"OH, THE WINDOW?

13:05.399 --> 13:06.467

13:11.238 --> 13:11.805
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS YOU'VE BEEN

13:11.872 --> 13:12.806
PAID FOR YOUR ABILITY TO THROW A

13:12.873 --> 13:13.440
BASEBALL ACCURATELY, HOW BIG THE

13:13.507 --> 13:14.041
NET WAS, AND HOW MANY FEET YOU

13:14.108 --> 13:17.044
MISSED IT BY.

13:17.111 --> 13:18.846
YOU JUST GO AHEAD AND TELL THE

13:18.912 --> 13:19.413
STORY WHILE I PULL UP THE

13:19.480 --> 13:20.381
VIDEO."

13:20.447 --> 13:21.248
AS FOR BROADCASTERS WHO ARE

13:21.315 --> 13:21.982
RELIANT ON LIVE EVENTS, THEY'RE

13:22.049 --> 13:22.783
NOW IN A TRULY DESPERATE

13:22.850 --> 13:24.184
SITUATION.

13:24.251 --> 13:25.419
WHILE ESPN MOVED UP THEIR

13:25.486 --> 13:26.653
TEN‐PART MICHAEL JORDAN

13:26.720 --> 13:27.888
DOCUMENTARY, THEY'VE OTHERWISE

13:27.955 --> 13:29.590
BEEN STRAPPED FOR CONTENT,

13:29.656 --> 13:31.492
AIRING VIDEO GAME VERSIONS OF

13:31.558 --> 13:33.027
BASEBALL AND BASKETBALL, WITH

13:33.093 --> 13:36.730
"SPORTSCENTER" AT ONE POINT

13:36.797 --> 13:46.807
ACTUALLY TWEETING OUT THIS:

13:46.874 --> 13:49.810
>> OKAY!

13:49.877 --> 13:52.112
[CHEERING]

13:52.179 --> 13:53.447
>> John: NOW, YOU MIGHT BE

13:53.514 --> 13:54.681
WONDERING, "WHAT THE FUCK DID I

13:54.748 --> 14:00.754
JUST SEE?"

14:00.821 --> 14:01.555
WELL, APPARENTLY, THAT CAME FROM

14:01.622 --> 14:02.189
A RUSSIAN SHOW CALLED

14:02.256 --> 14:02.823
"STONE FACES" WHERE CONTESTANTS

14:02.890 --> 14:03.757
SLAP EACH OTHER AS HARD AS THEY

14:03.824 --> 14:04.391
CAN.

14:04.458 --> 14:06.493
AND THIS PARTICULAR GUY IS A

14:06.560 --> 14:07.061
RENOWNED COMPETITIVE SLAPPER

14:07.127 --> 14:07.661
WHOSE REAL NAME DOESN'T MATTER

14:07.728 --> 14:09.163
BECAUSE HIS NICKNAME IS

14:09.229 --> 14:10.631
"DUMPLING," WHICH IS AN

14:10.697 --> 14:12.299
OUTSTANDING NAME FOR THAT MAN.

14:12.366 --> 14:13.233
AND AT THIS POINT, I DON'T NEED

14:13.300 --> 14:14.501
TO KNOW ANYTHING ELSE ‐‐ I'M ALL

14:14.568 --> 14:20.140
IN ON COMPETITIVE SLAPPING.

14:20.207 --> 14:21.041
JUST TELL ME WHAT CHANNEL TO

14:21.108 --> 14:21.875
SUBSCRIBE TO IN ORDER TO WATCH

14:21.942 --> 14:22.609
IT AND WHERE TO ORDER MY

14:22.676 --> 14:24.578
DUMPLING JERSEY.

14:24.645 --> 14:25.479
SO IF WE'RE ALL REACHING THE

14:25.546 --> 14:26.547
POINT OF DESPERATION WHERE WE'RE

14:26.613 --> 14:27.281
WILLING TO WATCH LARGE MEN SLAP

14:27.347 --> 14:29.983
EACH OTHER, THERE IS CLEARLY A

14:30.050 --> 14:31.785
DESIRE TO RESTART SPORTING

14:31.852 --> 14:33.554
EVENTS.

14:33.620 --> 14:35.856
THE QUESTION, THOUGH, ISN'T WHY

14:35.923 --> 14:36.890
SPORTS SHOULD COME BACK ‐‐ IT'S

14:36.957 --> 14:40.828
HOW THAT CAN SAFELY HAPPEN.

14:40.894 --> 14:41.762
BECAUSE TO DO IT RESPONSIBLY

14:41.829 --> 14:42.529
WOULD BE A MAMMOTH UNDERTAKING.

14:42.596 --> 14:43.697
TO DO IT IRRESPONSIBLY, HOWEVER,

14:43.764 --> 14:45.632
TURNS OUT TO BE PRETTY EASY.

14:45.699 --> 14:46.467
THE STATE OF FLORIDA EARLY ON

14:46.533 --> 14:47.801
DESIGNATED "PROFESSIONAL SPORTS

14:47.868 --> 14:49.470
AND MEDIA PRODUCTION WITH A

14:49.536 --> 14:50.804
NATIONAL AUDIENCE" AS AN

14:50.871 --> 14:52.272
ESSENTIAL SERVICE, SO LONG AS

14:52.339 --> 14:53.774
IT'S CLOSED TO THE GENERAL

14:53.841 --> 14:55.542
PUBLIC.

14:55.609 --> 14:57.811
SO THE WWE HAS CONTINUED STAGING

14:57.878 --> 14:58.846
SHOWS IN FLORIDA, HOLDING

14:58.912 --> 14:59.780
MATCHES IN FRONT OF EMPTY

14:59.847 --> 15:01.882
CHAIRS.

15:01.949 --> 15:02.983
BUT THAT REQUIRES A LOT MORE

15:03.050 --> 15:04.084
PEOPLE THAN JUST THOSE TWO

15:04.151 --> 15:05.519
WRESTLERS ‐‐ YOU NEED PRODUCTION

15:05.586 --> 15:06.220
CREWS WORKING IN CLOSE

15:06.286 --> 15:08.255
PROXIMITY.

15:08.322 --> 15:09.857
AND WHILE THE WWE MAINTAINS ITS

15:09.923 --> 15:10.958
SAFETY MEASURES ARE AS

15:11.024 --> 15:12.392
COMPREHENSIVE AS THEY CAN

15:12.459 --> 15:14.361
POSSIBLY BE, ONE EMPLOYEE WROTE

15:14.428 --> 15:16.163
AN ANONYMOUS LETTER TO A FLORIDA

15:16.230 --> 15:17.598
COUNTY COMMISSIONER ASKING THEM

15:17.664 --> 15:19.366
TO SHUT THE TAPINGS DOWN BECAUSE

15:19.433 --> 15:20.767
"DESPITE SANITARY PRECAUTIONS,

15:20.834 --> 15:22.236
WE CANNOT MAINTAIN SOCIAL

15:22.302 --> 15:23.370
DISTANCING AND HAVE TO TOUCH

15:23.437 --> 15:29.910
OTHER PEOPLE."

15:29.977 --> 15:30.878
BUT IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY CEO

15:30.944 --> 15:32.913
VINCE McMAHON WOULD BE WILLING

15:32.980 --> 15:33.647
FOR THEM TO TAKE THE RISK ‐‐

15:33.714 --> 15:34.281
AS HE TOLD INVESTORS ON A RECENT

15:34.348 --> 15:34.915
EARNINGS CALL, VIEWERS WANT TO

15:34.982 --> 15:35.582
SEE NEW MATCHES.

15:35.649 --> 15:37.417
>> I THINK NEW CONTENT IS ALWAYS

15:37.484 --> 15:40.320
A DRIVER IN TERMS OF STIMULATING

15:40.387 --> 15:41.989
INTEREST AND WHAT HAVE YOU, AND

15:42.055 --> 15:43.090
OBVIOUSLY EVERYONE IS PRETTY

15:43.157 --> 15:45.859
MUCH STARVED FOR NEW CONTENT.

15:45.926 --> 15:47.294
IT COULD VERY WELL BE THAT

15:47.361 --> 15:49.530
YOU'RE TIRED OF WATCHING NETFLIX

15:49.596 --> 15:52.166
AND YOU WANT TO SEE STRONG MEN

15:52.232 --> 15:53.133
RUNNING AROUND IN THEIR

15:53.200 --> 15:56.803
UNDERWEAR.

15:56.870 --> 15:58.372
>> John: OKAY, WELL, FIRST, I'D

15:58.438 --> 15:59.039
ARGUE THAT THE RISKS OF CREATING

15:59.106 --> 16:00.174
CONTENT THE WAY YOU ARE SEEM TO

16:00.240 --> 16:01.642
OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS RIGHT NOW.

16:01.708 --> 16:03.277
AND SECOND, NO ONE ON THAT CALL

16:03.343 --> 16:04.711
REGISTERED YOUR POINT, BECAUSE

16:04.778 --> 16:06.313
YOU JUST SAID "STIMULATING,"

16:06.380 --> 16:08.682
"STRONG MEN," "UNDERWEAR," AND,

16:08.749 --> 16:10.017
CRUCIALLY, "DRIVER" ALL IN THE

16:10.083 --> 16:11.818
SAME SENTENCE, AT WHICH POINT

16:11.885 --> 16:13.187
EVERYONE'S MINDS TURNED

16:13.253 --> 16:14.087
IMMEDIATELY TO GETTING

16:14.154 --> 16:15.155
ABSOLUTELY BONE‐CRUSHED BY

16:15.222 --> 16:16.523
ADAM DRIVER.

16:16.590 --> 16:17.958
CHOKE SLAM ME TO HELL,

16:18.025 --> 16:20.127
YOU NASTY SHED.

16:20.194 --> 16:22.095
JAM YOUR MANDIBLE CLAW DOWN MY

16:22.162 --> 16:25.365
THROAT, YOU IRREDEEMABLE STEER.

16:25.432 --> 16:28.101
QUICK SIDENOTE HERE: A LOT OF

16:28.168 --> 16:29.369
YOU MIGHT WELL BE WONDERING

16:29.436 --> 16:30.170
WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS BIT.

16:30.237 --> 16:30.737
IF YOU'RE ANYTHING LIKE MY

16:30.804 --> 16:31.605
STAFF, YOU'RE ASKING QUESTIONS

16:31.672 --> 16:32.706
LIKE "IS THIS SEXUAL OR IS IT

16:32.773 --> 16:33.774
VIOLENT?"

16:33.840 --> 16:35.175
AND YOU'RE THEN UNSATISFIED WHEN

16:35.242 --> 16:36.810
THE ANSWER COMES BACK, "YES."

16:36.877 --> 16:38.011
IF YOU'RE LIKE MY WIFE, YOU

16:38.078 --> 16:38.979
MIGHT BE ASKING, "SHOULD I BE

16:39.046 --> 16:39.980
WORRIED ABOUT THIS?" WITH YOUR

16:40.047 --> 16:41.381
CONCERN ONLY GROWING WHEN THE

16:41.448 --> 16:42.482
ANSWER IS "ONLY IF YOU WANT TO

16:42.549 --> 16:44.184
BE."

16:44.251 --> 16:45.819
AND WHAT OF ADAM DRIVER HIMSELF?

16:45.886 --> 16:46.753
IS HE BOTHERED BY THIS CONTINUED

16:46.820 --> 16:47.988
SEXUALIZATION?

16:48.055 --> 16:49.289
HE SEEMS LIKE A FAIRLY PRIVATE

16:49.356 --> 16:50.290
GUY WHO IS GENERALLY

16:50.357 --> 16:51.291
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH ATTENTION,

16:51.358 --> 16:52.392
MAKING WHAT I'M DOING POSSIBLY

16:52.459 --> 16:54.361
SOME FORM OF HARASSMENT.

16:54.428 --> 16:55.996
HE MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE PRETTY

16:56.063 --> 16:57.397
GOOD GROUNDS TO HAVE ME

16:57.464 --> 16:58.365
REPRIMANDED LEGALLY, TO WHICH I

16:58.432 --> 17:00.834
SAY, DO IT.

17:00.901 --> 17:02.402
SLAP A RESTRAINING ORDER ON ME,

17:02.469 --> 17:04.204
YOU FORLORN BLOCK.

17:04.271 --> 17:06.206
BEG ME TO STOP, YOU MENACING

17:06.273 --> 17:08.642
OBSTACLE.

17:08.709 --> 17:10.477
AND IT'S NOT JUST THE WWE ‐‐

17:10.544 --> 17:12.145
THEIR COMPETITOR, AEW, IS ALSO

17:12.212 --> 17:13.714
TAPING SHOWS IN FLORIDA.

17:13.780 --> 17:15.315
AND THE UFC JUST LAST WEEK

17:15.382 --> 17:16.283
STARTED HOSTING MATCHES IN

17:16.350 --> 17:18.185
JACKSONVILLE.

17:18.252 --> 17:19.553
AND WHILE THEY COULDN'T FLY IN

17:19.620 --> 17:20.587
INTERNATIONAL FIGHTERS FOR THAT

17:20.654 --> 17:21.755
EVENT, THEIR PRESIDENT,

17:21.822 --> 17:23.223
DANA WHITE, HAS DEVISED AN

17:23.290 --> 17:28.028
INSANE WORKAROUND.

17:28.095 --> 17:28.829
>> FIGHT ISLAND IS REAL.

17:28.895 --> 17:30.631
FIGHT ISLAND IS A REAL THING.

17:30.697 --> 17:32.299
IT'S REALLY HAPPENING.

17:32.366 --> 17:33.166
THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS BEING

17:33.233 --> 17:34.668
BUILT RIGHT NOW ON THE ISLAND.

17:34.735 --> 17:36.770
I'M READY TO GO.

17:36.837 --> 17:38.171
>> John: YES, THE UFC IS

17:38.238 --> 17:39.406
APPARENTLY BUILDING A FACILITY

17:39.473 --> 17:40.807
ON A PRIVATE ISLAND THAT THEY'RE

17:40.874 --> 17:44.111
CALLING "FIGHT ISLAND."

17:44.177 --> 17:44.678
NOW, IS THAT A CLEVER NAME?

17:44.745 --> 17:45.512
NO.

17:45.579 --> 17:46.446
IS IT THE PERFECT NAME?

17:46.513 --> 17:48.482
YES, BECAUSE IT'S THE FIRST

17:48.548 --> 17:50.150
THOUGHT AN IDIOT WOULD HAVE IF

17:50.217 --> 17:50.984
THEY WANTED TO NAME A PRIVATE

17:51.051 --> 17:53.754
ISLAND WHERE FIGHTS HAPPEN.

17:53.820 --> 17:54.855
NOW, HE COULD HAVE CALLED IT

17:54.921 --> 17:56.189
BRAWLHAMAS OR PUERTO RUCKUS OR

17:56.256 --> 17:57.791
OWIE MAUI OR SLAM MIGUEL.

17:57.858 --> 18:03.897
BUT HE DIDN'T.

18:03.964 --> 18:04.364
HE DIDN'T DO THAT.

18:04.431 --> 18:05.232
AND HE DIDN'T EVEN GO WITH THE

18:05.299 --> 18:05.866
OBVIOUS NAME FOR AN ISLAND WHERE

18:05.932 --> 18:06.633
YOU STAGE UFC FIGHTS, WHICH IS

18:06.700 --> 18:07.467
SIMPLY UFSEA.

18:07.534 --> 18:11.071
LOOK AT ME, DANA.

18:11.138 --> 18:11.705
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST CALL IT

18:11.772 --> 18:12.439
UFSEA?

18:12.506 --> 18:13.307
IT'S PERFECT.

18:13.373 --> 18:14.207
BUT CLEARLY, STAGING EVENTS IS

18:14.274 --> 18:15.509
RISKY AT THE MOMENT ‐‐ JUST THE

18:15.575 --> 18:16.910
DAY BEFORE LAST WEEKEND'S UFC

18:16.977 --> 18:17.844
EVENT, A FIGHTER HAD TO PULL OUT

18:17.911 --> 18:19.112
AFTER HE AND TWO OF HIS

18:19.179 --> 18:23.116
CORNERMEN TESTED POSITIVE.

18:23.183 --> 18:23.850
UNDERSCORING THE FACT THAT, IF

18:23.917 --> 18:25.419
YOU WANT TO COME BACK COMPLETELY

18:25.485 --> 18:26.553
WITHOUT RISK, THAT'S JUST NOT

18:26.620 --> 18:29.323
POSSIBLE RIGHT NOW.

18:29.389 --> 18:30.590
AND YET, MANY SPORTS

18:30.657 --> 18:33.493
ORGANIZATIONS ARE FEELING

18:33.560 --> 18:36.163
REAL PRESSURE TO IGNORE THAT

18:36.229 --> 18:37.698
RISK, ESPECIALLY COLLEGE SPORTS,

18:37.764 --> 18:39.032
WHERE SOME SCHOOLS' ATHLETIC

18:39.099 --> 18:40.300
PROGRAMS RELY HEAVILY ON REVENUE

18:40.367 --> 18:40.867
FROM FOOTBALL.

18:40.934 --> 18:41.968
AND WHILE YOU'D HOPE COACHES

18:42.035 --> 18:42.669
WOULD TALK ABOUT THE TRADEOFFS

18:42.736 --> 18:43.970
OF RISK AND SAFETY WITH SOME

18:44.037 --> 18:45.472
TACT, OKLAHOMA STATE FOOTBALL

18:45.539 --> 18:47.174
COACH MIKE GUNDY SEEMED

18:47.240 --> 18:48.308
COMPLETELY COMFORTABLE SAYING

18:48.375 --> 18:50.944
THE QUIET PARTS LOUD.

18:51.011 --> 18:52.379
>> IN MY OPINION, IF WE HAVE TO

18:52.446 --> 18:53.947
BRING OUR PLAYERS BACK, TEST

18:54.014 --> 18:55.549
THEM, THEY'RE IN GOOD SHAPE,

18:55.615 --> 18:56.717
THEY'RE ALL 18, 19, 20, 21, 22

18:56.783 --> 18:58.685
YEARS OLD, THEY'RE HEALTHY.

18:58.752 --> 19:00.887
A LOT OF THEM CAN FIGHT IT OFF

19:00.954 --> 19:02.456
WITH IT WITH THEIR NATURAL

19:02.522 --> 19:04.124
BODIES, THEIR ANTIBODIES, AND

19:04.191 --> 19:05.192
BUILD THAT THEY HAVE.

19:05.258 --> 19:06.059
WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO BUDGET

19:06.126 --> 19:06.693
AND RUN MONEY THROUGH THE STATE

19:06.760 --> 19:11.365
OF OKLAHOMA.

19:11.431 --> 19:12.032
>> John: JESUS CHRIST!

19:12.099 --> 19:12.799
I DON'T KNOW WHOSE MEDICAL

19:12.866 --> 19:13.767
ADVICE IS WORTH THE LEAST IN

19:13.834 --> 19:15.268
THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC, BUT

19:15.335 --> 19:16.403
"GUY WHO DOESN'T MIND UNPAID

19:16.470 --> 19:17.104
COLLEGE KIDS CONTRACTING A

19:17.170 --> 19:18.438
POTENTIALLY DEADLY DISEASE SO

19:18.505 --> 19:20.474
EVERYONE ELSE CAN MAKE

19:20.540 --> 19:22.442
MILLIONS" IS DOWN NEAR THE

19:22.509 --> 19:24.778
BOTTOM ALONG WITH THE ADVICE OF

19:24.845 --> 19:25.512
"FUNERAL PARLOR MAGNATE" AND

19:25.579 --> 19:26.313
"THE CORONAVIRUS WEARING

19:26.380 --> 19:29.649
A FAKE MUSTACHE."

19:29.716 --> 19:30.951
NOW, GUNDY LATER APOLOGIZED FOR

19:31.017 --> 19:32.619
THOSE COMMENTS, BUT THERE WAS A

19:32.686 --> 19:33.487
REAL HONESTY TO WHAT HE SAID.

19:33.553 --> 19:34.554
PROFIT IS A POWERFUL MOTIVATOR

19:34.621 --> 19:37.991
HERE, ESPECIALLY FOR SOME TEAM

19:38.058 --> 19:38.725
OWNERS, WHO WON'T BE THE ONES

19:38.792 --> 19:41.395
TAKING THE RISKS.

19:41.461 --> 19:42.763
AND IT'S WHY MAJOR SPORTS LIKE

19:42.829 --> 19:44.798
BASEBALL AND FOOTBALL ARE SO

19:44.865 --> 19:45.599
EAGERLY PURSUING PLANS TO COME

19:45.665 --> 19:49.002
BACK.

19:49.069 --> 19:49.970
BUT ASSUMING THAT YOU CAN'T JUST

19:50.036 --> 19:50.804
STAGE ALL EVENTS IN JACKSONVILLE

19:50.871 --> 19:52.005
OR ON SOME STUPIDLY NAMED ISLAND

19:52.072 --> 19:54.274
SOMEWHERE, HOW DO YOU DO IT IN

19:54.341 --> 19:56.243
THE SAFEST POSSIBLE WAY?

19:56.309 --> 19:58.211
WELL, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

19:58.278 --> 19:59.012
ANTHONY FAUCI HAS OUTLINED HOW

19:59.079 --> 20:00.547
THAT COULD HAPPEN.

20:00.614 --> 20:02.315
>> THERE'S A WAY OF DOING THAT.

20:02.382 --> 20:03.683
NOBODY COMES TO THE STADIUM.

20:03.750 --> 20:05.185
PUT THEM IN BIG HOTELS, YOU

20:05.252 --> 20:08.588
KNOW, WHEREVER YOU WANT TO PLAY,

20:08.655 --> 20:13.126
KEEP THEM VERY WELL SURVEILLED,

20:13.193 --> 20:13.994
NAMELY A SURVEILLANCE, BUT

20:14.060 --> 20:14.728
HAVE THEM TESTED, LIKE, EVERY

20:14.795 --> 20:15.362
WEEK.

20:15.429 --> 20:15.996
AND MAKE SURE THEY DON'T WIND UP

20:16.062 --> 20:16.696
INFECTING EACH OTHER OR THEIR

20:16.763 --> 20:17.330
FAMILY AND JUST LET THEM PLAY

20:17.397 --> 20:17.831
THE SEASON OUT.

20:17.898 --> 20:18.799
>> John: YEAH.

20:18.865 --> 20:20.133
YOU JUST ISOLATE EVERYONE

20:20.200 --> 20:20.967
INVOLVED AND TEST THE HELL OUT

20:21.034 --> 20:22.302
OF THEM.

20:22.369 --> 20:23.537
WHICH INTUITIVELY SEEMS LIKE IT

20:23.603 --> 20:24.905
MIGHT WORK.

20:24.971 --> 20:26.106
AFTER ALL, WE ALREADY HAVE A

20:26.173 --> 20:27.607
SHOW WHERE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE

20:27.674 --> 20:28.508
WITH INCREDIBLE BODIES GET

20:28.575 --> 20:29.943
MONITORED ALL DAY TO MAKE SURE

20:30.010 --> 20:31.111
THEY DON'T TOUCH EACH OTHER.

20:31.178 --> 20:34.381
IT'S CALLED "TOO HOT TO HANDLE,"

20:34.448 --> 20:35.182
AND IT IS PERFECT.

20:35.248 --> 20:36.450
ONE OF THE HOT IDIOTS PROPOSED

20:36.516 --> 20:38.051
TO ONE OF THE OTHER HOT IDIOTS

20:38.118 --> 20:38.652
WITH A RING POP, AND IF YOU

20:38.718 --> 20:41.988
HAVEN'T WATCHED THIS SHOW AND

20:42.055 --> 20:42.823
YOU'RE STILL COMPLAINING ABOUT

20:42.889 --> 20:43.623
BEING STARVED FOR CONTENT,

20:43.690 --> 20:45.992
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND.

20:46.059 --> 20:48.962
AND IDEAS ALONG THE LINES OF

20:49.029 --> 20:50.197
WHAT FAUCI JUST PROPOSED ‐‐

20:50.263 --> 20:50.797
SO‐CALLED "BUBBLE LEAGUES" ‐‐

20:50.864 --> 20:51.665
HAVE BEEN FLOATED FOR MULTIPLE

20:51.731 --> 20:52.532
SPORTS.

20:52.599 --> 20:54.234
MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL, FOR

20:54.301 --> 20:55.535
INSTANCE, WAS, AT ONE POINT

20:55.602 --> 20:56.470
REPORTEDLY DISCUSSING PLANS TO

20:56.536 --> 20:58.538
PLAY ALL THEIR GAMES IN ARIZONA.

20:58.605 --> 21:00.140
AND ON ITS FACE, THAT SEEMS

21:00.207 --> 21:01.541
SIMPLE: YOU JUST SECLUDE THE

21:01.608 --> 21:03.243
TEAMS AND HAVE THEM PLAY WITH NO

21:03.310 --> 21:05.278
FANS.

21:05.345 --> 21:07.280
BUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT

21:07.347 --> 21:08.882
FOR MORE THAN A SECOND, IT ALL

21:08.949 --> 21:09.516
BECOMES MUCH, MUCH MORE

21:09.583 --> 21:10.517
COMPLICATED.

21:10.584 --> 21:11.751
BECAUSE, OF COURSE, YOU WOULDN'T

21:11.818 --> 21:13.353
JUST BE ISOLATING PLAYERS ‐‐

21:13.420 --> 21:14.821
YOU'D BE DOING THAT FOR COACHING

21:14.888 --> 21:16.156
STAFF, TEAM PHYSICIANS,

21:16.223 --> 21:17.257
TRAINERS, UMPIRES, CLUBHOUSE

21:17.324 --> 21:18.391
ATTENDANTS, BUS DRIVERS, CAMERA

21:18.458 --> 21:19.459
CREWS, AND HOTEL STAFF, TO NAME

21:19.526 --> 21:21.928
JUST A FEW.

21:21.995 --> 21:22.863
BY ONE ESTIMATE, EVEN A BUBBLE

21:22.929 --> 21:25.432
LEAGUE WOULD REQUIRE NEARLY

21:25.499 --> 21:26.833
10,000 PEOPLE, ALL OF WHOM WOULD

21:26.900 --> 21:29.536
NEED CONSTANT TESTING.

21:29.603 --> 21:31.004
AND THERE'S A KEY DISTINCTION

21:31.071 --> 21:32.739
HERE, BECAUSE WHILE

21:32.806 --> 21:33.874
PRO WRESTLERS, UFC FIGHTERS, AND

21:33.940 --> 21:36.543
COLLEGE ATHLETES HAVE NO UNION,

21:36.610 --> 21:38.545
THOSE IN MAJOR PRO SPORTS DO,

21:38.612 --> 21:39.880
AND THEREFORE HAVE SIGNIFICANT

21:39.946 --> 21:41.848
NEGOTIATING POWER.

21:41.915 --> 21:43.783
SO IF YOU WANT THEM TO ISOLATE

21:43.850 --> 21:45.785
THEMSELVES FROM THEIR FAMILIES

21:45.852 --> 21:47.320
AND PUT THEIR LIVES AT RISK, YOU

21:47.387 --> 21:49.556
NEED THEIR AGREEMENT, AND SOME

21:49.623 --> 21:50.891
BIG NAMES, LIKE THE ANGELS'

21:50.957 --> 21:51.825
MIKE TROUT, STILL HAVE SOME

21:51.892 --> 21:53.226
SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS.

21:53.293 --> 21:54.361
>> WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH

21:54.427 --> 21:55.328
FAMILY MEMBERS?

21:55.395 --> 21:57.430
MY WIFE IS PREGNANT.

21:57.497 --> 21:58.298
WHAT AM I GONNA DO WHEN, YOU

21:58.365 --> 21:59.833
KNOW, SHE GOES INTO LABOR?

21:59.900 --> 22:01.101
AM I GONNA HAVE TO QUARANTINE

22:01.167 --> 22:03.703
FOR TWO WEEKS AFTER I COME BACK?

22:03.770 --> 22:04.771
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY I

22:04.838 --> 22:05.939
CAN'T MISS THAT, YOU KNOW, BIRTH

22:06.006 --> 22:09.242
OF OUR FIRST CHILD.

22:09.309 --> 22:13.446
>> John: YEAH, HE'S RIGHT.

22:13.513 --> 22:14.381
THE LEAGUE SHOULD NOT ASK ANYONE

22:14.447 --> 22:15.015
TO MISS THE BIRTH OF THEIR FIRST

22:15.081 --> 22:15.382
CHILD.

22:15.448 --> 22:16.883
THAT IS A MAGIC MOMENT.

22:16.950 --> 22:17.417
NOW, SECOND CHILD, THAT'S

22:17.484 --> 22:17.817
NEGOTIABLE.

22:17.884 --> 22:18.552
SAME SHIT, DIFFERENT DAY.

22:18.618 --> 22:19.419
THIRD CHILD, I'M NOT EVEN SURE

22:19.486 --> 22:20.253
THE MOTHER HAS TO BE THERE.

22:20.320 --> 22:21.621
BUT THAT FIRST CHILD?

22:21.688 --> 22:24.224
SIMPLY UNMISSABLE.

22:24.291 --> 22:25.926
AND AFTER PUSHBACK FROM MULTIPLE

22:25.992 --> 22:27.060
PLAYERS, MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL

22:27.127 --> 22:29.329
HAS WALKED AWAY FROM THE ARIZONA

22:29.396 --> 22:30.497
IDEA, WITH AN OFFICIAL EVEN

22:30.564 --> 22:31.898
SAYING EARLIER THIS MONTH,

22:31.965 --> 22:33.500
"I WOULD BE LYING IF WE WERE TO

22:33.567 --> 22:35.001
SAY WE HAVE A GOOD IDEA.

22:35.068 --> 22:37.170
THEY'RE ALL DEGREES OF BAD."

22:37.237 --> 22:39.072
AND THAT IS TRUE OF SO MANY

22:39.139 --> 22:40.574
CURRENT PROPOSALS FOR SPORTS TO

22:40.640 --> 22:42.709
COME BACK.

22:42.776 --> 22:44.177
THE SECOND YOU START READING THE

22:44.244 --> 22:45.412
DETAILS OF ANY PLAN, IT

22:45.478 --> 22:46.279
AUTOMATICALLY BECOMES

22:46.346 --> 22:47.480
RIDICULOUS.

22:47.547 --> 22:48.882
THE MLB'S NEW IDEA IS TO PLAY AN

22:48.949 --> 22:50.483
ABBREVIATED SEASON IN AS MANY

22:50.550 --> 22:51.851
EMPTY HOME BALLPARKS AS

22:51.918 --> 22:54.020
POSSIBLE.

22:54.087 --> 22:55.388
BUT TEAMS WOULD STILL HAVE TO

22:55.455 --> 22:57.557
TRAVEL TO THOSE, MEANING THEY'RE

22:57.624 --> 23:02.762
NOT BEING QUARANTINED.

23:02.829 --> 23:04.097
AND FOR A SENSE OF JUST HOW EASY

23:04.164 --> 23:04.864
IT IS FOR SOMETHING TO GO WRONG,

23:04.931 --> 23:05.332
LOOK AT GERMANY.

23:05.398 --> 23:06.700
THAT COUNTRY HAS HANDLED THIS

23:06.766 --> 23:11.071
PANDEMIC MUCH, MUCH BETTER AND

23:11.137 --> 23:11.771
THEY ARE IN A VERY DIFFERENT

23:11.838 --> 23:12.639
SITUATION THAN WE ARE, AND THAT

23:12.706 --> 23:13.907
ENABLED THEIR SOCCER LEAGUE TO

23:13.974 --> 23:15.642
ACTUALLY COME BACK THIS WEEKEND,

23:15.709 --> 23:17.177
EMPLOYING A KIND OF BUBBLE

23:17.243 --> 23:23.984
LEAGUE APPROACH WITHOUT FANS,

23:24.050 --> 23:24.551
WITH ALL TEAM PERSONNEL

23:24.618 --> 23:25.352
QUARANTINED IN A HOTEL.

23:25.418 --> 23:26.119
BUT TWO PLAYERS HAVE ALREADY

23:26.186 --> 23:26.786
TESTED POSITIVE, FORCING THEIR

23:26.853 --> 23:27.587
ENTIRE TEAM TO ISOLATE FOR

23:27.654 --> 23:28.688
14 DAYS, AND ONE TOP COACH

23:28.755 --> 23:30.190
MISSED THE FIRST GAME AFTER HE

23:30.256 --> 23:32.525
LEFT THE HOTEL TO BUY TOOTHPASTE

23:32.592 --> 23:33.827
AND NOW CAN'T REJOIN HIS TEAM

23:33.893 --> 23:37.797
UNTIL HE HAS TWO NEGATIVE TESTS.

23:37.864 --> 23:39.566
AND THAT SHOWS JUST HOW

23:39.633 --> 23:41.034
DIFFICULT IT IS TO DO ANY OF

23:41.101 --> 23:46.339
THIS EFFECTIVELY.

23:46.406 --> 23:48.842
AND LOOK, I WILL OWN THE FACT

23:48.908 --> 23:49.409
I REALLY WANT SPORTS TO COME

23:49.476 --> 23:50.043
BACK.

23:50.110 --> 23:51.711
THERE'S NO DOUBT THEY HAVE THE

23:51.778 --> 23:53.213
ABILITY TO INSPIRE.

23:53.279 --> 23:54.714
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SPORT

23:54.781 --> 23:56.016
DOES BEST IS BRING PEOPLE

23:56.082 --> 23:57.283
TOGETHER IN TIMES OF CRISIS,

23:57.350 --> 23:58.618
LIKE WHEN THE YANKEES RESUMED

23:58.685 --> 23:59.653
PLAYING AFTER 9/11.

23:59.719 --> 24:01.221
UNFORTUNATELY, BRINGING PEOPLE

24:01.287 --> 24:06.326
TOGETHER IS THE EXACT THING WE

24:06.393 --> 24:06.993
SHOULD NOT BE DOING RIGHT NOW.

24:07.060 --> 24:07.827
AND WHILE SPORT WAS GENUINELY

24:07.894 --> 24:08.862
HELPFUL AT THE START OF THIS

24:08.928 --> 24:10.797
CRISIS IN SHOWING US HOW SERIOUS

24:10.864 --> 24:12.699
THE VIRUS WAS, IF IT COMES BACK

24:12.766 --> 24:13.967
TOO SOON AND IRRESPONSIBLY, IT

24:14.034 --> 24:15.368
WON'T BE AN INSPIRATION ‐‐

24:15.435 --> 24:18.405
IT'LL BE A CAUTIONARY TALE.

24:18.471 --> 24:19.639
SO, HARD AS IT IS TO HEAR, WE

24:19.706 --> 24:20.807
MIGHT NEED A LITTLE MORE TIME TO

24:20.874 --> 24:28.415
MAKE SURE WE GET THIS RIGHT.

24:28.481 --> 24:29.849
PHASING SPORTS BACK IN SLOWLY

24:29.916 --> 24:30.450
WITH TAILORED APPROACHES THAT

24:30.517 --> 24:33.153
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EACH LEVEL OF

24:33.219 --> 24:35.822
CONTACT AND ROBUST SYSTEMS OF

24:35.889 --> 24:38.191
TRACKING AND TRACING.

24:38.258 --> 24:39.292
AND I KNOW THERE IS A CURRENT

24:39.359 --> 24:39.993
ABSENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES.

24:40.060 --> 24:40.794
SO, IDEALLY, WHAT YOU'D WANT IS

24:40.860 --> 24:41.428
SOMETHING THAT COULD FILL THAT

24:41.494 --> 24:42.128
GAP FOR A WHILE UNTIL SPORTS CAN

24:42.195 --> 24:42.662
RETURN, SOMETHING WITH AN

24:42.729 --> 24:43.196
EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE, A

24:43.263 --> 24:43.830
SCHEDULE OF HEART‐POUNDING

24:43.897 --> 24:45.565
EVENTS, A PASSIONATE FANBASE,

24:45.632 --> 24:47.133
AND NO HUMAN CONTACT ‐‐

24:47.200 --> 24:48.068
SOMETHING TO WHICH I AM

24:48.134 --> 24:49.369
OBVIOUSLY BUILDING.

24:49.436 --> 24:51.204
>> IF YOU'VE BEEN ON TWITTER

24:51.271 --> 24:52.906
LATELY, YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THIS

24:52.972 --> 24:54.941
VIRAL VIDEO.

24:55.008 --> 24:55.875
>> MARBLES IN THE BLOCK, AND

24:55.942 --> 24:56.810
THEY'RE OFF!

24:56.876 --> 24:57.677
>> IT'S A NECK AND NECK AND NECK

24:57.744 --> 24:58.912
RACE UP THERE AT THE FRONT, OH,

24:58.978 --> 25:00.680
AND ACTUALLY COMET HITS THE

25:00.747 --> 25:02.749
DIVIDER, THE ATTENUATOR SLOWS

25:02.816 --> 25:04.317
HIM DOWN, AND HE FALLS BACK INTO

25:04.384 --> 25:05.618
THIRD PLACE NOW UNDER THE

25:05.685 --> 25:12.892
CLUTCHES OF DEEP OCEAN, SO IT'S

25:12.959 --> 25:13.727
REFLECTOR OUT IN THE FRONT,

25:13.793 --> 25:14.294
AND NOW TARANTULA TAKES THE

25:14.360 --> 25:14.761
LEAD!

25:14.828 --> 25:15.295
>> John: FUCK YES.

25:15.361 --> 25:15.829
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU

25:15.895 --> 25:16.429
TO JELLE'S MARBLE RUNS.

25:16.496 --> 25:17.063
THEY'RE BASED IN THE

25:17.130 --> 25:17.831
NETHERLANDS, AND THEY'RE A

25:17.897 --> 25:18.565
COMPETITIVE MARBLE RACING LEAGUE

25:18.631 --> 25:19.866
THAT IS ‐‐ TO PUT IT MILDLY ‐‐

25:19.933 --> 25:22.268
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.

25:22.335 --> 25:23.803
THEY UPLOAD RACES TO THIS

25:23.870 --> 25:26.840
YOUTUBE CHANNEL ON A REGULAR

25:26.906 --> 25:27.707
BASIS, AND NOBODY TO WHOM WE'VE

25:27.774 --> 25:29.709
SHOWN THIS ‐‐ INCLUDING

25:29.776 --> 25:30.877
NON‐SPORTS FANS ‐‐ HAS NOT ENDED

25:30.944 --> 25:35.782
UP WANTING TO WATCH MORE.

25:35.849 --> 25:36.449
THERE ARE ENTIRE RACETRACKS WITH

25:36.516 --> 25:37.050
MARBLES AS FANS, PLUS A MARBLE

25:37.117 --> 25:38.017
TOURNAMENT WITH 16 DIFFERENT

25:38.084 --> 25:38.918
EVENTS, FEATURING RELAYS, WATER

25:38.985 --> 25:41.421
COURSES, AND OBSTACLES.

25:41.488 --> 25:42.622
AND THERE ARE ALSO BACKSTORIES

25:42.689 --> 25:45.992
FOR THE MARBLES INVOLVED AND

25:46.059 --> 25:47.026
SOME TRULY PASSIONATE FANS.

25:47.093 --> 25:48.361
>> 20,000 PEOPLE FROM AROUND

25:48.428 --> 25:50.096
THE WORLD TUNED IN LIVE TO

25:50.163 --> 25:52.298
WATCH LAST WEEK'S RACE, AND

25:52.365 --> 25:53.233
JELLE'S MARBLE RUNS YOUTUBE

25:53.299 --> 25:55.168
CHANNEL HAS MILLIONS OF VIEWS.

25:55.235 --> 25:56.770
>> THERE ARE BIG FAN BASES BUILT

25:56.836 --> 25:57.904
UP, NOT JUST FOR THE TEAMS, BUT

25:57.971 --> 25:59.005
FOR THE INDIVIDUAL MARBLES.

25:59.072 --> 26:00.306
AND WHEN ONE ISN'T PERFORMING

26:00.373 --> 26:01.574
VERY WELL IN THE SEASON, YOU'RE

26:01.641 --> 26:02.976
GONNA HEAR ABOUT IT ON THERE.

26:03.042 --> 26:04.110
AND ‐‐ AND THEY WILL, YOU KNOW,

26:04.177 --> 26:05.278
LET THAT MARBLE KNOW THEY GOTTA

26:05.345 --> 26:08.915
PICK UP THEIR GAME A LITTLE BIT.

26:08.982 --> 26:10.116
>> John: NOW, ON THE ONE HAND,

26:10.183 --> 26:11.017
THAT'S AMAZING.

26:11.084 --> 26:12.685
ON THE OTHER HAND, THE MARBLES

26:12.752 --> 26:14.154
DON'T REALLY NEED FANS TO TELL

26:14.220 --> 26:14.721
THEM WHEN THEY'RE OFF THEIR

26:14.788 --> 26:15.088
GAME.

26:15.155 --> 26:15.755
I MEAN, TAKE A LOOK AT THE

26:15.822 --> 26:16.389
MIDNIGHT WISPS.

26:16.456 --> 26:17.457
THEY CAME IN FOURTH IN THEIR

26:17.524 --> 26:18.057
DEBUT SEASON, JUST MISSING THE

26:18.124 --> 26:19.492
PODIUM.

26:19.559 --> 26:24.197
BUT DID THEY SETTLE FOR THAT?

26:24.264 --> 26:24.731
NO, THEY DIDN'T.

26:24.798 --> 26:26.466
THEY CAME BACK THE NEXT YEAR AND

26:26.533 --> 26:26.766
WON IT ALL.

26:26.833 --> 26:27.400
THEY USED THEIR SHORTCOMINGS AS

26:27.467 --> 26:27.967
MOTIVATION TO COME BACK EVEN

26:28.034 --> 26:28.701
STRONGER.

26:28.768 --> 26:29.569
OR...

26:29.636 --> 26:32.205
ROUNDER?

26:32.272 --> 26:32.739
I DON'T KNOW.

26:32.806 --> 26:33.373
WHICHEVER ADJECTIVE IS BEST FOR

26:33.439 --> 26:34.541
MARBLES.

26:34.607 --> 26:35.575
THE POINT IS, THIS ISN'T JUST A

26:35.642 --> 26:36.276
YOUTUBE DISTRACTION.

26:36.342 --> 26:37.644
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL COMPETITIVE

26:37.710 --> 26:38.845
EVENT, AND THE WORLD NEEDS THOSE

26:38.912 --> 26:43.249
MORE THAN EVER RIGHT NOW.

26:43.316 --> 26:44.217
THIS YEAR'S MARBLE LEAGUE

26:44.284 --> 26:44.818
TOURNAMENT IS ACTUALLY DUE TO

26:44.884 --> 26:45.585
START NEXT MONTH.

26:45.652 --> 26:46.686
UNFORTUNATELY, WITH TIMES BEING

26:46.753 --> 26:48.288
HARD, THE LEAGUE WAS STRUGGLING

26:48.354 --> 26:49.856
FOR MONEY, EVEN TWEETING,

26:49.923 --> 26:51.357
"TO MAKE THE #MarbleLeague, WE

26:51.424 --> 26:52.325
NEED SPONSORS ‐‐ A HEADSPONSOR

26:52.392 --> 26:54.561
AND SOME SMALLER SPONSORS."

26:54.627 --> 26:56.563
SO THIS BEAUTIFUL THING IS IN

26:56.629 --> 26:57.964
DANGER OF GOING AWAY, JUST WHEN

26:58.031 --> 27:01.167
WE NEED IT THE MOST.

27:01.234 --> 27:02.936
OR RATHER, IT WAS IN DANGER,

27:03.002 --> 27:03.970
BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT, THEY'RE

27:04.037 --> 27:05.572
NOT ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR A

27:05.638 --> 27:07.740
SPONSOR ANYMORE.

27:07.807 --> 27:10.076
AND THE REASON I KNOW THAT IS

27:10.143 --> 27:10.844
YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE NEW

27:10.910 --> 27:11.678
SOLE SPONSOR OF THE UPCOMING

27:11.744 --> 27:14.480
MARBLE LEAGUE TOURNAMENT.

27:14.547 --> 27:15.582
THAT IS RIGHT.

27:15.648 --> 27:16.783
WE ARE PROUDLY SPONSORING ALL 16

27:16.850 --> 27:20.720
EVENTS OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS.

27:20.787 --> 27:21.621
BUT WAIT, THERE'S A TWIST HERE.

27:21.688 --> 27:22.455
BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO OUR

27:22.522 --> 27:23.623
SPONSORSHIP, THE WINNER OF EACH

27:23.690 --> 27:24.791
EVENT WILL GET $5,000 DONATED TO

27:24.858 --> 27:26.726
A FOOD BANK IN THEIR NAME.

27:26.793 --> 27:28.161
WHETHER THAT NAME IS

27:28.228 --> 27:29.362
THE RASPBERRY RACERS,

27:29.429 --> 27:31.464
THE GREEN DUCKS, THE HAZERS,

27:31.531 --> 27:32.866
OR EVEN THE OCEANICS ‐‐

27:32.932 --> 27:34.067
ALTHOUGH, FRANKLY, THEY'RE GOING

27:34.133 --> 27:35.235
TO NEED A TON OF REORGANIZATION

27:35.301 --> 27:38.004
IN THE LOCKER ROOM, BECAUSE THEY

27:38.071 --> 27:39.172
WERE A FUCKING MESS LAST YEAR.

27:39.239 --> 27:40.773
AND WHAT'S MORE, AT THE END OF

27:40.840 --> 27:42.308
THE ENTIRE TOURNAMENT, THE

27:42.375 --> 27:44.477
OVERALL WINNER WILL GET A
