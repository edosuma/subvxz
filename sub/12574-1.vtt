Bring him down!

00:17.556 --> 00:19.456
Never forget this day, Rachel.

00:19.522 --> 00:21.722
Tell your grandchildren
that you were there...

00:21.789 --> 00:24.088
...when word came that
the great tyrant Darken Rahl...

00:24.155 --> 00:25.355
...was gone forever.

00:25.422 --> 00:26.722
Where did he go?

00:26.789 --> 00:28.823
Thanks to the Seeker,
that monster is dead...

00:28.889 --> 00:31.789
...and rotting for all eternity
in the Underworld.

00:47.489 --> 00:50.088
Darken Rahl.

00:50.155 --> 00:53.088
<i>Kneel before the Keeper.</i>

00:55.155 --> 00:56.322
Forgive me, Master.

00:56.389 --> 00:59.022
I have failed you.

00:59.088 --> 01:01.022
<i>No. You have succeeded.</i>

01:01.088 --> 01:03.722
<i>Exactly as I intended.</i>

01:03.789 --> 01:05.155
My Lord?

01:05.221 --> 01:08.222
<i>And now you will help me
expand my dominion...</i>

01:08.289 --> 01:09.456
<i>...to the World Above.</i>

01:12.289 --> 01:14.689
Yes, Keeper.

01:14.756 --> 01:16.689
But I must warn you.

01:16.756 --> 01:18.988
There is one who will
stand in your way.

01:21.155 --> 01:22.656
As he stood in mine.

01:22.722 --> 01:25.889
<i>There is no escape from death.</i>

01:25.955 --> 01:29.222
<i>Even the Seeker
will belong to me.</i>

01:31.222 --> 01:32.522
To the Seeker.

01:32.589 --> 01:35.456
To the Seeker!

01:39.589 --> 01:43.222
* When shadows long
O'er take the day *

01:43.289 --> 01:45.955
* And evil doth enslave us *

01:46.022 --> 01:48.355
This is flattering,

01:48.422 --> 01:49.756
but we should
get on the road soon.

01:49.823 --> 01:51.289
If we leave now,

01:51.355 --> 01:53.422
we can put in six leagues
before the moon goes down.

01:53.489 --> 01:55.856
And offend our hosts?

01:55.923 --> 01:58.155
* Kingdoms fall
The Seeker then shall *

01:58.222 --> 02:00.155
The tyrant's only
been dead a week.

02:00.222 --> 02:01.988
Savor each victory, Richard.

02:02.055 --> 02:04.556
As though it were
a juicy leg of mutton.

02:04.622 --> 02:06.689
You never know when
it'll be your last.

02:06.756 --> 02:09.322
Well, that's encouraging.

02:14.088 --> 02:15.155
That was lovely.

02:15.222 --> 02:16.823
Rachel.

02:16.889 --> 02:18.722
Come.

02:20.289 --> 02:22.322
Sit, child.

02:22.389 --> 02:24.189
Are you going to stay here
with us?

02:24.255 --> 02:25.556
It's nice here.

02:25.622 --> 02:28.656
I wish we could.

02:28.722 --> 02:31.988
But Richard and I need to see
Kahlan safely to Aydindril.

02:32.055 --> 02:33.556
Why are you going there?

02:33.622 --> 02:36.889
That's where
the Mother Confessor presides.

02:36.955 --> 02:39.422
The Midlands under
the rule of law and justice.

02:39.489 --> 02:41.122
I never thought
I'd live to see the day.

02:41.189 --> 02:42.389
Are you going to marry Richard?

02:44.689 --> 02:45.955
Rachel!

02:46.022 --> 02:47.155
Uh, it's all right.

02:47.222 --> 02:48.889
Um...

02:52.022 --> 02:54.189
No, we're not
getting married.

02:54.255 --> 02:56.189
Don't you love each other?

02:56.255 --> 02:58.789
Yes.

02:58.856 --> 03:01.456
But my duties
as a Confessor,

03:01.522 --> 03:03.622
...my powers,

03:03.689 --> 03:04.988
...keep me from being able...

03:05.055 --> 03:06.955
...to be a wife to Richard.

03:07.022 --> 03:08.222
That's not fair.

03:11.189 --> 03:13.022
It's awfully warm in here,
isn't it?

03:13.088 --> 03:16.055
How about a special treat
to cool you off?

03:16.122 --> 03:17.189
Yes, please.

03:17.255 --> 03:20.022
Do you like apple cider?

03:23.322 --> 03:25.988
There you go, my dear.

04:08.122 --> 04:10.556
Everybody stop!

04:10.622 --> 04:12.988
The creature can only
see you if you move.

04:27.823 --> 04:29.722
Martha!

04:29.789 --> 04:31.189
Rachel. Stop.

04:31.255 --> 04:32.522
Hey, you. Over here.

04:36.556 --> 04:38.155
Come on.

04:45.088 --> 04:46.222
Hyah!

05:03.622 --> 05:05.389
Right here, you bastard!

05:44.722 --> 05:46.889
We're wasting time, Cara.

05:48.556 --> 05:52.689
You're disturbing my bath,
Triana.

05:52.756 --> 05:54.656
While you're washing
your hair,

05:54.722 --> 05:58.155
...D'Hara is going to pieces.

05:58.222 --> 06:01.389
We should go to
the People's Palace now.

06:01.456 --> 06:04.055
And do what when
we get there?

06:04.122 --> 06:06.489
Loot the wine cellar?

06:06.556 --> 06:10.189
We swear our allegiance
to Lord Rahl.

06:10.255 --> 06:13.088
Lord Rahl is dead.

06:13.155 --> 06:15.923
If he were the last
of his bloodline,

06:15.988 --> 06:18.289
...then our Agiels would
have lost their power.

06:34.222 --> 06:37.022
If and when the new Lord Rahl
should claim the throne,

06:37.088 --> 06:40.988
...we'll decide if he's worthy
of our services.

06:41.055 --> 06:44.022
Until then,

06:44.088 --> 06:46.088
...who better to bring order
to the territories...

06:46.155 --> 06:47.489
...than the Mord-Sith?

06:47.556 --> 06:49.556
I've called for a meeting...

06:49.622 --> 06:52.222
...of all our sisters
at the Temple of Jandralyn.

06:52.289 --> 06:55.856
We leave today.

06:55.923 --> 06:57.222
When did you
become queen?

06:57.289 --> 06:59.556
I must have missed
the coronation.

07:19.355 --> 07:21.689
I demand
an honorable death.

07:21.756 --> 07:22.789
It's my right
as a Mord-Sith.

07:22.856 --> 07:25.456
You deserve no honor.

07:25.522 --> 07:28.589
You will stay alive,
and serve me.

07:35.389 --> 07:37.722
Does anybody else
have a problem?

07:37.989 --> 07:39.856
Tracks came from down here.

07:49.555 --> 07:51.589
What in the name of the Spirits?

08:02.288 --> 08:05.023
It's as I feared.

08:05.089 --> 08:07.522
The creatures escaped
from the Underworld.

08:07.589 --> 08:09.188
It's a screeling.

08:09.255 --> 08:10.555
Like the nursery rhyme.

08:12.089 --> 08:13.389
<i>The screelings are loose,</i>

08:13.455 --> 08:15.222
<i>The Keeper may win,</i>

08:15.288 --> 08:18.089
<i>His assassins have come
To rip off your skin.</i>

08:18.155 --> 08:19.489
If I remember right,
the poem says

08:19.555 --> 08:21.422
...the only way to kill it
is to hack it into pieces.

08:21.489 --> 08:23.489
Richard tried hacking it
with the Sword of Truth.

08:23.555 --> 08:25.155
It didn't even seem
to hurt the creature.

08:25.222 --> 08:27.089
If we can't kill it,
we'll find it and trap it.

08:27.155 --> 08:29.756
Our problems are far greater
than one nasty monster.

08:29.822 --> 08:32.989
This crack in the earth,

08:33.056 --> 08:35.188
...it's a tear in the veil
that separates the Underworld...

08:35.255 --> 08:36.655
...from the World of the Living.

08:36.722 --> 08:39.155
As long as it's open,

08:39.222 --> 08:41.322
...there's no way to prevent
the Keeper of the Underworld,

08:41.389 --> 08:42.989
...the great enemy
of all that walks,

08:43.056 --> 08:45.056
...breathes and grows
in the light,

08:45.123 --> 08:46.589
...from sending his minions

08:46.656 --> 08:48.989
...to bring death
to every living thing.

08:49.056 --> 08:52.455
I fear the screeling
is but the vanguard.

08:52.522 --> 08:54.056
How could this
have happened?

08:54.123 --> 08:56.789
In all my years
as a Wizard,

08:56.856 --> 08:58.355
I have only known
one form of magic

08:58.422 --> 09:01.056
...strong enough
to tear the veil.

09:01.123 --> 09:03.756
The Power of Orden.

09:06.722 --> 09:08.522
This happened when
I killed Rahl.

09:08.589 --> 09:11.589
When the Boxes of Orden
exploded.

09:11.656 --> 09:13.922
Wizard's Second Rule:

09:13.989 --> 09:16.656
The greatest harm can come
from the best intentions.

09:16.722 --> 09:20.056
Well, if I did this,
I'll find a way to undo it.

09:20.123 --> 09:22.023
The only way I know of
to close the rift...

09:22.089 --> 09:23.889
...is the way the Creator
sealed the Underworld...

09:23.956 --> 09:25.389
...at the beginning of time.

09:25.455 --> 09:28.322
The Stone of Tears.

09:28.389 --> 09:29.989
He who possesses the Stone...

09:30.056 --> 09:32.389
...would be able
to repair the veil.

09:32.455 --> 09:33.789
Then we'll find it.

09:35.989 --> 09:38.922
The Stone has been lost
for centuries beyond count.

09:38.989 --> 09:41.389
Many have given their lives
searching for it.

09:41.455 --> 09:45.622
If anyone can find it,
the Seeker can.

09:45.689 --> 09:47.422
Kahlan, I share your faith
in Richard.

09:47.489 --> 09:49.455
But the veil is delicate.

09:49.522 --> 09:51.722
In the time it takes
to find one tiny Stone...

09:51.789 --> 09:54.355
...amid all the rocks
and mountains of creation,

09:54.422 --> 09:56.389
...cracks like this
could appear anywhere,

09:56.455 --> 09:59.555
...spreading and splintering
in all directions.

09:59.622 --> 10:01.288
And then
there would be nothing...

10:01.355 --> 10:02.989
...to prevent the Keeper
from waging war...

10:03.056 --> 10:04.889
...on the World of the Living.

10:07.322 --> 10:08.389
Seeker!

10:08.455 --> 10:10.123
D'Harans soldiers
are in the town.

10:10.188 --> 10:11.422
They're demanding
to see you.

10:31.856 --> 10:35.489
Darken Rahl is dead.

10:35.555 --> 10:37.822
The war is over.

10:39.656 --> 10:41.956
Lay down your arms,
or you will feel my Sword.

10:43.722 --> 10:45.489
We have not come to fight,
My Lord.

10:52.589 --> 10:55.155
Master Rahl, guide us.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.689
Master Rahl, protect us.

10:57.756 --> 10:59.956
In your light, we thrive.

11:00.023 --> 11:02.489
In your wisdom, we are humbled.

11:02.555 --> 11:04.789
We live only to serve.

11:04.856 --> 11:07.056
Our lives are yours.

11:09.522 --> 11:12.355
I was born
into the service...

11:12.422 --> 11:13.956
...of Darken Rahl's
father,

11:14.023 --> 11:16.489
...Lord Panis Rahl.

11:18.023 --> 11:20.155
Some called him a tyrant,

11:20.222 --> 11:21.555
...but in his time
there was peace...

11:21.622 --> 11:26.489
...and order throughout
the territories.

11:26.555 --> 11:30.522
<i>He took pride
in his first-born son.</i>

11:30.589 --> 11:33.555
<i>But as the boy grew older,</i>

11:33.622 --> 11:35.288
<i>...the father came to see</i>

11:35.355 --> 11:36.989
<i>the darkness
in his son's heart.</i>

11:38.188 --> 11:39.089
<i>And his love...</i>

11:39.155 --> 11:42.756
<i>...for the dark ways of sorcery.</i>

11:42.822 --> 11:45.956
<i>The father began to fear
for the future of his kingdom.</i>

11:46.023 --> 11:48.288
When he learned
of a Prophecy...

11:48.355 --> 11:50.155
...that said he would
sire another son,

11:50.222 --> 11:53.555
...one who would kill his
black-hearted older brother,

11:53.622 --> 11:57.089
Panis set out to ensure
the truth of that Prophecy.

11:57.155 --> 11:59.455
He fathered a child...

11:59.522 --> 12:00.889
...with a young woman...

12:00.956 --> 12:04.355
...whose bloodline was
as powerful as his own.

12:05.922 --> 12:07.089
Tarralyn Zorander.

12:08.422 --> 12:09.355
That's a lie.

12:09.422 --> 12:10.756
My daughter would never

12:10.822 --> 12:12.756
have lain with Panis Rahl.

12:12.822 --> 12:15.188
Yes, Wizard.
Panis knew this too.

12:15.255 --> 12:18.656
<i>Which is why he wooed Tarralyn...</i>

12:18.722 --> 12:21.922
<i>...in the guise
of a young shepherd.</i>

12:21.989 --> 12:25.389
<i>In this form,
he won her heart,</i>

12:25.455 --> 12:28.689
<i>...and conceived
a child with her.</i>

12:28.756 --> 12:31.123
But in his pride,

12:31.188 --> 12:33.422
...my master made
a foolish mistake.

12:33.489 --> 12:36.023
He boasted to Darken Rahl...

12:36.089 --> 12:39.489
...that the son prophesied
to kill him would soon be born.

12:44.023 --> 12:46.155
<i>In a rage,</i>

12:46.222 --> 12:48.722
<i>...Darken Rahl
slew his own father...</i>

12:48.789 --> 12:51.589
<i>...and commanded me
to dispose of the body.</i>

12:51.656 --> 12:56.222
<i>But I convinced Panis Rahl's
most faithful Mord-Sith...</i>

12:56.288 --> 12:59.056
<i>...to revive him
with the Breath of Life,</i>

13:00.422 --> 13:04.389
<i>...then killed her
to protect the secret.</i>

13:04.455 --> 13:07.389
While Panis
went into hiding,

13:07.455 --> 13:09.355
...I dispatched a rider
to Tarralyn's father,

13:09.422 --> 13:12.656
...to warn him that Darken Rahl
had ordered the death...

13:12.722 --> 13:15.288
...of all first-born sons
of Brennidon,

13:15.355 --> 13:18.756
...where the Prophecy said
the child would be born.

13:25.656 --> 13:28.255
I never knew who sent me
that message.

13:28.322 --> 13:31.389
And we never knew
if you received.

13:31.455 --> 13:33.555
This is some sort of trap.

13:33.622 --> 13:36.288
It's no trap, My Lord.

13:36.355 --> 13:39.155
I have carried this secret
for 24 years,

13:39.222 --> 13:42.288
...waiting for the day that
the Prophecy might be fulfilled,

13:42.355 --> 13:44.656
...so that I could pledge
my loyalty to you...

13:44.722 --> 13:48.023
...and to escort you
back to the People's Palace...

13:48.089 --> 13:50.589
...to assume your rightful place
on the throne.

13:50.656 --> 13:53.123
If you do not believe me,

13:53.188 --> 13:56.522
...order your Confessor to do what
she must to verify my words.

13:56.589 --> 13:58.322
There's no need.

14:00.756 --> 14:03.489
He's telling the truth.

14:07.422 --> 14:09.822
Tighter.

14:09.889 --> 14:11.056
Yes, Mistress.

14:11.123 --> 14:15.722
Is there anything else
I can do to please you?

14:20.123 --> 14:22.389
I'm sure there is.

14:24.422 --> 14:26.489
When we have more time.

14:53.989 --> 14:55.622
Lord Rahl.

14:55.689 --> 14:59.222
Scrubbing the floors,
Triana?

14:59.288 --> 15:02.155
I would've thought that
were beneath your station.

15:02.222 --> 15:03.255
You're alive.

15:04.656 --> 15:06.188
No, not alive.

15:06.255 --> 15:09.555
But still your master.

15:11.355 --> 15:14.288
And I need you to perform
a special task for me.

15:14.355 --> 15:17.023
And for the one
I serve.

15:17.089 --> 15:19.555
Lord Rahl serves no man.

15:21.689 --> 15:23.422
Not a man, Triana.

15:23.489 --> 15:26.056
But we all have
our masters.

15:26.123 --> 15:29.589
Mine is
the Keeper of the Underworld.

15:29.656 --> 15:32.689
And when he conquers all life,

15:32.756 --> 15:35.856
...those who stood by him
will be rewarded.

15:35.922 --> 15:39.288
If my Lord follows the Keeper,
then so do I.

15:39.355 --> 15:43.222
But Cara has taken command.

15:43.288 --> 15:45.188
Cara helped the Seeker
to kill me.

15:45.255 --> 15:47.389
She cannot
be trusted.

15:47.455 --> 15:50.622
Which is why before
you begin this special task...

15:50.689 --> 15:52.722
...I have for you,

15:52.789 --> 15:56.155
...you and your sisters
must destroy her.

15:58.589 --> 15:59.656
How could I have been...

15:59.722 --> 16:01.056
...so consumed by the acquisition...

16:01.123 --> 16:02.589
...of magic and power
that I neglected...

16:02.656 --> 16:03.922
...to protect
my own daughter?

16:04.789 --> 16:05.856
Zedd, I'm sorry.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.856
Listen to me,

16:07.923 --> 16:10.122
...thinking of myself,
when you've just learned...

16:10.189 --> 16:12.955
...that the great tyrant
you fought so hard to kill.

16:13.022 --> 16:15.222
No. He wasn't.

16:15.289 --> 16:18.322
Richard, I know this is
hard to accept but--

16:18.389 --> 16:19.889
Kahlan, I'm not challenging
the words...

16:19.955 --> 16:21.222
...of the Mother Confessor here.

16:21.289 --> 16:23.756
But blood isn't
what makes somebody family.

16:23.823 --> 16:25.856
I didn't share blood with
George and Mary Cypher,

16:25.923 --> 16:28.389
...but they'll always be
my parents.

16:28.456 --> 16:29.856
Now Zedd,
do you have any idea...

16:29.923 --> 16:31.689
...where we can pick up the trail
of the Stone of Tears?

16:31.756 --> 16:34.289
If there is a clue,

16:34.355 --> 16:36.522
...it's to be found
in the ancient volumes...

16:36.589 --> 16:38.589
...at the Wizard's Keep
in Aydindril.

16:38.656 --> 16:41.689
Go, find what you can.
Kahlan, stay here.

16:41.756 --> 16:43.222
Call the people
of the town inside,

16:43.289 --> 16:44.689
...board up every window
and doorway.

16:44.756 --> 16:45.889
What about you?

16:45.955 --> 16:47.322
The screeling
is still out there.

16:47.389 --> 16:49.088
I'm gonna hunt it down
and kill it.

16:50.656 --> 16:52.489
You say you and your men
will follow me?

16:52.556 --> 16:54.856
To the death,
My Lord.

16:54.923 --> 16:56.722
Maybe with a few more swords,

16:56.789 --> 16:59.255
...we can hack this thing
to pieces.

16:59.322 --> 17:01.289
And then we're going
to the People's Palace.

17:05.155 --> 17:07.321
You're going to proclaim
yourself the new Lord Rahl?

17:07.388 --> 17:09.088
You said it yourself.

17:09.155 --> 17:11.255
Our problem is a lot bigger
than one monster.

17:11.321 --> 17:13.422
With the veil torn,
the Keeper will wage war...

17:13.489 --> 17:15.289
...on the World of the Living.

17:15.355 --> 17:16.888
And if we have
to fight that war,

17:16.954 --> 17:18.988
...we could use
an army behind us.

17:19.055 --> 17:22.021
I must warn you to expect
violent opposition, My Lord.

17:22.088 --> 17:24.122
What are you
talking about?

17:24.189 --> 17:26.923
My men and I alone bear
the secret to your parentage.

17:26.988 --> 17:30.823
Many D'Harans will not easily
accept your claim to the throne.

17:30.889 --> 17:33.355
In order to win the allegiance
of the greatest number,

17:33.422 --> 17:35.823
I recommend you
immediately execute...

17:35.889 --> 17:38.489
...every member
of the Third Battalion.

17:40.055 --> 17:42.322
I'm not gonna kill
my own men.

17:42.389 --> 17:44.889
They are D'Harans,
My Lord.

17:44.955 --> 17:46.988
If they are to follow you,
they must fear you.

17:47.055 --> 17:49.988
I'll find a way
to deal with them.

17:51.889 --> 17:54.622
Right now,
we're going to kill a screeling.

18:09.988 --> 18:10.923
Wolves?

18:10.988 --> 18:13.122
That's no wolf.

18:33.756 --> 18:36.756
Since the custom
has been broken,

18:36.823 --> 18:39.656
...we won't give her
an honorable death.

18:41.122 --> 18:42.489
We will leave her,

18:42.556 --> 18:45.055
...to that shrieking creature,

18:45.122 --> 18:47.422
...or the townspeople.

18:47.489 --> 18:49.522
Whoever gets her first.

19:08.389 --> 19:11.222
The work of the screeling,
My Lord.

19:11.289 --> 19:13.055
We'll find him
before he kills again.

19:33.022 --> 19:34.456
What is that?

19:53.255 --> 19:54.656
Rachel!

19:54.722 --> 19:56.055
Martha!

19:56.122 --> 19:57.088
Protect
your daughters.

19:59.856 --> 20:01.622
Mother!

20:01.689 --> 20:03.988
- Mama!
- Sarah!

20:33.856 --> 20:35.489
No mercy!

20:37.689 --> 20:40.055
Trimack.

20:40.122 --> 20:42.389
Forgive me, Lord Rahl.

20:42.456 --> 20:45.489
I have failed
to protect you.

20:55.088 --> 20:56.856
Seeker?

20:56.923 --> 20:58.955
Why are you doing
marching with these dogs?

20:59.022 --> 21:00.556
Call off your men,
and I'll call off mine.

21:03.155 --> 21:05.055
Put down your weapons!

21:05.122 --> 21:06.155
Stand down!

21:10.456 --> 21:13.055
I'm Morwyn Bryer,

21:13.122 --> 21:14.823
...leader of the resistance
in this valley.

21:14.889 --> 21:17.656
We got word the Dragon Corps
were marching on Ehrengard...

21:17.722 --> 21:20.656
...and gathered as fast
as we could.

21:20.722 --> 21:21.988
But they've already
left a trail...

21:22.055 --> 21:23.823
...of slaughtered men,
women and children.

21:23.889 --> 21:25.489
Those people were killed
by a screeling,

21:25.556 --> 21:26.756
...escaped from
the Underworld.

21:26.823 --> 21:28.923
A screeling?

21:28.988 --> 21:30.389
These men are helping me
track it.

21:32.422 --> 21:33.955
They say the Seeker is wise,

21:34.022 --> 21:35.622
...but only a fool
would trust D'Harans.

21:35.689 --> 21:37.955
You will address Lord Rahl
with respect.

21:40.255 --> 21:42.689
Lord Rahl?
It's not what you think.

21:42.756 --> 21:44.856
The Seeker has taken on the
title of his greatest enemy?

21:44.923 --> 21:47.222
A title he was born to.
We fought to trade Rahls?

21:47.289 --> 21:49.222
You fought for your freedom,
and you won it.

21:49.289 --> 21:50.889
The war against
the D'Harans is over.

21:50.955 --> 21:52.722
But we're fighting
a new war now,

21:52.789 --> 21:55.222
...against an even
more powerful enemy.

21:55.289 --> 21:56.823
And if we
stand together--

21:56.889 --> 21:59.055
You expect us
to fight shoulder to shoulder...

21:59.122 --> 22:00.656
...with the butchers
who massacred...

22:00.722 --> 22:02.689
...our friends
and defiled our daughters?

22:02.756 --> 22:04.022
Rebel coward!

22:05.355 --> 22:07.656
Any man here who raises
a weapon against another...

22:07.722 --> 22:09.622
...will die by my sword!

22:13.322 --> 22:14.622
It's Ehrengard.

22:14.689 --> 22:16.489
The screeling must have
gone back to the town.

22:16.556 --> 22:18.456
Go.
Protect your families.

22:18.522 --> 22:20.422
Let's move.

22:20.489 --> 22:22.088
<i>We saved as many as we could,</i>

22:22.155 --> 22:24.222
...but they got away
with seven girls.

22:26.422 --> 22:28.389
Including Rachel.

22:29.756 --> 22:31.422
We'll get them back.

22:34.556 --> 22:36.756
We're going after
the Mord-Sith.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.656
My Lord,

22:38.722 --> 22:40.355
...we came here to escort...

22:40.422 --> 22:43.355
...the new Lord Rahl
to the People's Palace,

22:43.422 --> 22:45.389
...not save a few
little girls.

22:45.456 --> 22:48.722
You know what will happen
to those girls.

22:48.789 --> 22:50.255
Torture.

22:50.322 --> 22:51.955
Death to those
who won't break.

22:52.022 --> 22:53.756
That is how
they become Mord-Sith.

22:53.823 --> 22:55.722
How it has always been.

22:55.789 --> 22:57.422
So they can serve
the Lord Rahl.

22:57.489 --> 22:59.522
And if you
truly were him,

22:59.589 --> 23:01.823
...you would not pity them.

23:01.889 --> 23:05.122
You would know that some day
you will need to use them.

23:05.189 --> 23:07.988
That's not how things
are going to be anymore.

23:08.055 --> 23:11.489
Maybe old Trimack
was wrong.

23:11.556 --> 23:14.088
Maybe this man
is too soft-hearted...

23:14.155 --> 23:15.656
...to lead D'Hara--

23:19.456 --> 23:22.456
Anyone else wanna
question my orders?

23:32.412 --> 23:34.178
The Mord-Sith temple
was abandoned, Lord Rahl.

23:36.144 --> 23:37.979
We found this one
in a gully.

23:38.045 --> 23:39.445
Cara.

23:39.511 --> 23:40.545
Lord Rahl?

23:42.511 --> 23:43.778
You've certainly come up
in the world.

23:45.712 --> 23:48.645
Where are the children?
What children?

23:48.712 --> 23:50.812
The girls your sisters
took from Ehrengard.

23:50.879 --> 23:55.011
If any girls were taken,
my sisters must have done it...

23:55.078 --> 23:58.678
...after they beat me
and left me to die.

23:58.745 --> 24:00.011
I'll get the truth
out of her.

24:00.078 --> 24:01.412
You can tell
she's lying?

24:03.678 --> 24:05.612
Their training makes
the Mord-Sith hard to read.

24:05.678 --> 24:06.845
But I'll find out.

24:12.612 --> 24:15.412
She's the one who helped me
kill Darken Rahl.

24:15.478 --> 24:18.879
Whatever she did,
she did to save her own skin.

24:18.944 --> 24:20.412
Richard, we can't trust her.

24:20.478 --> 24:22.944
I'm not telling you
to trust her.

24:23.011 --> 24:24.812
I'm telling you
to trust me.

24:32.445 --> 24:34.978
You're going to help us
find your sisters.

24:35.044 --> 24:38.345
If you help me kill them.

24:50.245 --> 24:51.745
Don't be scared.

24:51.812 --> 24:54.578
The Seeker and the Confessor
will save us.

24:54.645 --> 24:55.879
I said no talking.

24:58.345 --> 25:00.445
No.

25:00.512 --> 25:02.512
It's my fault. Punish me.

25:07.773 --> 25:09.734
Since you're so eager,

25:10.311 --> 25:11.779
I don't see why we couldn't

25:11.845 --> 25:13.678
...begin with your training
right now.

25:15.412 --> 25:18.412
Triana. I got your message.

25:18.478 --> 25:21.011
What's so important?

25:21.078 --> 25:24.678
How about a treasonous
Dragon Corps squadron?

25:24.745 --> 25:26.779
Escorting none other
than the Seeker...

25:26.845 --> 25:29.745
...to the People's Palace.

25:29.812 --> 25:31.512
To proclaim him
the new Lord Rahl.

25:34.645 --> 25:38.278
I thought that might
interest you.

25:38.345 --> 25:39.678
That way.

25:39.745 --> 25:41.412
Wait.

25:41.478 --> 25:42.712
If they went that way,

25:42.779 --> 25:44.645
...they took the girls
to the Drowning Cave.

25:44.712 --> 25:46.812
Drowning Cave?

25:46.879 --> 25:48.678
During the rains
the river floods it.

25:48.745 --> 25:51.478
Uncooperative trainees are left
there just before a storm.

25:51.545 --> 25:52.911
Charming.

25:52.978 --> 25:54.512
In the dry season,
you can get in,

25:54.578 --> 25:56.812
...but only through
a high narrow canyon.

25:56.879 --> 26:00.412
But once you're in,
there's no other way out.

26:00.478 --> 26:01.911
It's a trap.

26:01.978 --> 26:03.812
And I'm sure it's just
a coincidence...

26:03.879 --> 26:05.478
...that a squadron
of the Third Battalion...

26:05.545 --> 26:09.011
...has been camped in the meadow
just south of the cave.

26:09.078 --> 26:10.879
Richard, maybe this was
their plan all along.

26:10.944 --> 26:12.879
Lure you into an ambush...

26:12.944 --> 26:15.245
...because they knew you would do
anything to save the children.

26:15.311 --> 26:17.712
Yes, the Seeker's
kind-heartedness...

26:17.779 --> 26:19.978
...is legendary.

26:21.911 --> 26:25.545
If water flows into the cave
it has to flow out somewhere.

26:25.612 --> 26:28.578
There's an aquifer
that empties into the marsh.

26:28.645 --> 26:30.512
But it's barely big enough
to crawl through,

26:30.578 --> 26:32.145
...and anybody who tried
would be greeted...

26:32.211 --> 26:34.512
...by Mord-Sith as soon as they
came through the other side.

26:34.578 --> 26:36.712
We can draw most of the
Mord-Sith out of the cave...

26:36.779 --> 26:38.445
...if we stage an attack
through the canyon.

26:38.512 --> 26:40.178
Richard,
that's exactly what they want.

26:40.245 --> 26:41.879
That's what we'll give them,

26:41.944 --> 26:44.345
...while you go through the aquifer
and rescue the girls.

26:46.011 --> 26:47.111
You'll show her the way.

26:47.178 --> 26:49.678
Anybody who marches
into that canyon...

26:49.745 --> 26:51.445
...will be outnumbered
and pinned down.

26:51.512 --> 26:53.812
They'll be slaughtered.

26:55.944 --> 26:58.111
Death means nothing to us,
Lord Rahl.

26:58.178 --> 27:05.211
We will do
whatever you command.

27:20.978 --> 27:23.044
Hello, Zeddicus.

27:23.111 --> 27:25.745
What brings the great Shota
so far from Agaden Reach?

27:25.812 --> 27:29.445
The great Zeddicus,
what else?

27:33.211 --> 27:35.278
A personal visit
to an old friend?

27:37.911 --> 27:42.078
If you're looking for answers,
I don't have any yet.

27:42.145 --> 27:44.311
I'm on my way to Aydindril
in search of them.

27:44.378 --> 27:46.145
I've already had a vision...

27:46.211 --> 27:48.278
...of exactly what you will
discover in Aydindril.

27:50.345 --> 27:52.712
A passage in
the Seventh Codex of Sandragon...

27:52.779 --> 27:54.145
...will direct you
to the hiding place...

27:54.211 --> 27:55.978
...of the Stone of Tears.

27:56.044 --> 27:59.879
I couldn't have hoped
for better news.

27:59.944 --> 28:02.812
Tell me what the passage says
so I can relay it to the Seeker.

28:02.879 --> 28:06.011
Yes, we're all relying
on the Seeker.

28:08.612 --> 28:10.111
But not Richard Rahl.

28:12.211 --> 28:13.944
It is written in
the Halls of Prophecy...

28:14.011 --> 28:15.445
...that Richard Rahl
will fail...

28:15.512 --> 28:17.211
...in his quest
to defeat the Keeper.

28:24.145 --> 28:26.578
Richard puts
no faith in Prophecy.

28:26.645 --> 28:30.078
He will defeat the Keeper
just as he defeated Darken Rahl.

28:30.145 --> 28:31.845
Yes, he did defeat
Darken Rahl...

28:31.911 --> 28:33.879
...exactly as
the Prophecies predicted.

28:33.978 --> 28:36.512
But now the Prophecy says
he will fail.

28:36.578 --> 28:38.578
You can't pick or choose...

28:38.645 --> 28:41.645
...which Prophecies you want
to believe in, Zeddicus.

28:46.145 --> 28:48.311
So I should throw up my hands,
give up?

28:48.378 --> 28:51.011
No,
the Prophecy is forked.

28:51.078 --> 28:52.412
It can be avoided.

28:52.478 --> 28:54.978
But if the World of the Living
is to be saved,

28:56.879 --> 28:59.445
...you must name
a new Seeker.

29:01.345 --> 29:04.044
What kind of trick is this?

29:04.111 --> 29:08.445
Richard is the one,
true Seeker.

29:08.512 --> 29:12.911
Are you speaking now
as a Wizard of the First Order?

29:12.978 --> 29:15.011
Or as his grandfather?

29:17.512 --> 29:19.345
Three signs will
come before you.

29:19.412 --> 29:21.412
First,

29:21.478 --> 29:23.345
Richard will deny
that which gives him power.

29:25.512 --> 29:27.378
Second,
he will embrace the one in red.

29:27.445 --> 29:30.512
And finally,
he will bear the mark...

29:30.578 --> 29:33.678
...of the one who will
destroy all of life.

29:33.745 --> 29:37.111
When you've seen
these three signs,

29:37.178 --> 29:39.612
...you will know that
I have spoken the truth.

29:39.678 --> 29:42.779
And if you do not then
do what must be done,

29:42.845 --> 29:45.645
...the Keeper will win,

29:45.712 --> 29:47.445
...and the World of the Living
will be devoured...

29:47.512 --> 29:48.879
...by the Realm of Death.

30:18.245 --> 30:21.078
Where is the Seeker?

30:21.145 --> 30:23.778
Has your new Lord Rahl
abandoned you already?

30:23.845 --> 30:25.811
Give us the girls,

30:25.878 --> 30:27.412
...and we'll let you live.

30:27.479 --> 30:31.711
It is you and your men
who will die here today.

30:40.045 --> 30:41.811
Halt.

30:41.878 --> 30:43.412
Traitors!

30:43.479 --> 30:46.412
Slaughter them all!

30:46.479 --> 30:49.412
For D'Hara
and Lord Rahl!

30:58.678 --> 31:00.178
This way.

31:08.945 --> 31:11.078
Give me your hand.

31:19.312 --> 31:21.312
I don't know exactly
what you did

31:21.379 --> 31:22.544
to make Richard trust you.

31:26.012 --> 31:28.278
But if this is
some sort of trick,

31:28.345 --> 31:30.245
I will kill you.

32:46.112 --> 32:47.544
Hello, sisters.

32:50.912 --> 32:53.678
I've brought you a prize.

32:53.745 --> 32:55.378
The Mother Confessor.

33:08.112 --> 33:10.545
Kahlan. I knew you'd come.

33:10.611 --> 33:12.378
We have to go. Fast.

33:12.444 --> 33:14.912
Help me
get them out of here.

33:14.978 --> 33:16.378
I didn't come
for the children.

33:46.179 --> 33:48.444
This belongs to me.

34:06.145 --> 34:08.279
Thank you, Seeker.

34:08.344 --> 34:09.978
I shudder to think
what would have happened...

34:10.045 --> 34:11.245
...if you weren't here.

34:11.311 --> 34:12.678
You should thank these men too.

34:12.745 --> 34:14.179
They fought together...

34:14.245 --> 34:15.878
...to help save Rachel
and the other girls.

34:15.945 --> 34:18.710
It would have been an honor
to die for Lord Rahl.

34:18.777 --> 34:20.145
My men and I
fight for the Seeker.

34:20.212 --> 34:22.012
Not Lord Rahl.

34:27.378 --> 34:28.945
War is easy.

34:29.012 --> 34:31.745
It's peace
that will break your heart.

34:31.812 --> 34:33.112
Zedd.
Why are you back so soon?

34:33.179 --> 34:35.511
I ran into our
old friend Shota.

34:35.578 --> 34:37.344
What did she want?

34:39.112 --> 34:40.078
Zedd, is something wrong?

35:03.611 --> 35:05.311
Hey!

35:07.444 --> 35:09.711
You wanna rip
somebody's head off,

35:09.778 --> 35:13.078
...take mine.

35:25.412 --> 35:27.178
Unh! Zedd, now!

36:05.279 --> 36:08.611
"Seek out the abbot
of the Cloister of Ulrich

36:08.678 --> 36:11.611
for he keeps the secret of
the Stone close to his heart."

36:11.678 --> 36:14.511
These are the words
written in Codex.

36:14.578 --> 36:16.112
Ulrich is in the
opposite direction...

36:16.178 --> 36:17.611
...of the People's Palace.

36:17.678 --> 36:20.045
I'm not going
to the People's Palace.

36:20.112 --> 36:21.345
But I thought--

36:21.411 --> 36:22.444
I'm not claiming the throne.

36:27.511 --> 36:29.912
You're denying that which
would give you power.

36:29.978 --> 36:32.078
What's important right now
is finding the Stone of Tears...

36:32.145 --> 36:33.379
...and closing the rift.

36:33.444 --> 36:36.379
Richard, the Stone
is a very small object...

36:36.444 --> 36:38.212
...in a very large world.

36:38.279 --> 36:39.578
Think how much more ground...

36:39.645 --> 36:41.178
...you could cover
with the armies of D'Hara...

36:41.245 --> 36:42.645
...under your command.

36:42.711 --> 36:44.511
Even if an army could help us,

36:44.578 --> 36:47.145
how many would I have to kill
to unite the D'Harans?

36:47.212 --> 36:51.012
How long would it take while
the Keeper grows stronger?

36:51.078 --> 36:54.078
And think of the thousands who
saw their brothers and sons die...

36:54.145 --> 36:56.345
...fighting the House of Rahl.

36:56.411 --> 36:58.078
Would they follow me
if I claim...

36:58.145 --> 37:01.078
...the title of the tyrant
they despised?

37:01.145 --> 37:04.912
Or would I become the same
enemy I'd just defeated?

37:04.978 --> 37:07.379
You could
do things differently.

37:07.444 --> 37:10.578
Today you convinced enemies
to fight side-by-side.

37:10.645 --> 37:12.178
A few men.

37:12.245 --> 37:15.112
Against other followers of Rahl
who still wanted to kill me.

37:15.178 --> 37:16.478
If people want to follow me...

37:16.544 --> 37:18.578
...because they believe
in what I'm fighting for,

37:18.645 --> 37:19.878
I'll lead them.

37:19.945 --> 37:22.212
But I'm not
crowning myself king.

37:25.945 --> 37:28.345
I'm not Lord Rahl.

37:28.411 --> 37:30.212
I'm Richard Cypher.

37:31.711 --> 37:33.411
I'm the Seeker.

37:36.745 --> 37:40.544
And you are
the Mother Confessor.

37:40.611 --> 37:44.012
Zedd and I will see you
safely to Aydindril,

37:44.078 --> 37:46.711
...and then we'll hunt
for the Stone.

37:46.778 --> 37:48.912
And when it's over,
I'll come back for you.

37:51.511 --> 37:52.778
Richard,
I don't like it.

37:54.478 --> 37:56.611
The two of you alone?

37:56.678 --> 37:57.811
Three.

38:01.845 --> 38:04.444
A Mord-Sith
serves Lord Rahl.

38:04.511 --> 38:06.645
You don't strike me
as a type of person

38:06.711 --> 38:09.112
who likes to serve anybody.

38:09.178 --> 38:11.212
And I'm not accepting
the title Lord Rahl.

38:11.279 --> 38:13.511
If you're foolish enough...

38:13.578 --> 38:15.945
...to turn down
the throne of D'Hara,

38:16.012 --> 38:17.678
...then you need me all the more.

38:22.444 --> 38:25.212
All right.
Richard.

38:25.279 --> 38:28.112
Twice now she's proven herself
to me. I can use her.

38:29.411 --> 38:30.978
We best say our goodbyes,

38:31.045 --> 38:33.444
I've got a long journey.

38:35.778 --> 38:38.411
Embracing the one in red.

38:38.478 --> 38:39.578
What?

38:39.645 --> 38:41.078
Nothing.

39:17.678 --> 39:20.145
Aydindril.

39:20.212 --> 39:22.245
Seventy leagues
over that ridge.

39:30.379 --> 39:32.045
I've been thinking.

39:32.112 --> 39:34.544
You said yourself the most
important thing right now...

39:34.611 --> 39:36.312
...is finding the Stone of Tears.

39:38.411 --> 39:41.312
I should be helping you
do that.

39:42.978 --> 39:44.345
What about Aydindril?

39:47.978 --> 39:49.544
I'll get there.

39:49.611 --> 39:51.112
When all this is over.

39:53.745 --> 39:57.544
But as long as
you're still the Seeker,

39:57.611 --> 39:59.778
...you need your Confessor
by your side.

40:43.978 --> 40:44.978
What do you want?

40:47.045 --> 40:49.078
To give you fair warning.

40:49.145 --> 40:51.078
We are brothers,
after all.

40:51.145 --> 40:52.811
You're no brother to me.

40:56.112 --> 40:58.045
You've already killed me once.

40:58.112 --> 40:59.945
You can't kill me again.

41:01.345 --> 41:03.578
You believe you're fighting
for peace, for freedom.

41:03.645 --> 41:08.378
But how many have you killed
in this fruitless quest already?

41:08.445 --> 41:11.612
How many will
you kill tomorrow?

41:11.678 --> 41:14.778
Everything you do trying
to defeat my master,

41:14.845 --> 41:17.578
...only makes him stronger.

41:17.645 --> 41:21.578
You believe you
are serving life, brother.

41:21.645 --> 41:23.745
But the truth is,

41:23.812 --> 41:27.278
...you are for the Keeper.

41:29.912 --> 41:32.478
Richard.

41:33.745 --> 41:34.678
You all right?

41:37.645 --> 41:40.578
I'm fine.
Just a bad dream.

41:40.645 --> 41:42.111
Well, it's over now.

41:54.845 --> 41:55.778
What is it?

41:59.244 --> 42:00.712
It's the Mark of the Keeper.

42:02.912 --> 42:05.945
The mark of the one who would
destroy all life.
