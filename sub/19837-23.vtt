<b>Kukuroo Mountain.</b>

00:17.830 --> 00:23.240
<b>The home of the famous Zoldyck

00:24.180 --> 00:27.520
<b>Visitors come, every day, 
hoping for a glimpse of the</b>

<b>mansion that no one has ever seen before.</b>

00:31.450 --> 00:34.830
<b>It is a very popular tourist spot 
in this nation.</b>

00:34.150 --> 00:37.010
<b>Lamentation Tours</b>

01:57.640 --> 02:00.930
<b>Well, how long will you be here?</b>

02:00.930 --> 02:02.680
<b>Until we meet Killua!</b>

02:03.000 --> 02:05.350
<b>We won't leave before then!</b>

02:08.720 --> 02:11.230
<b>Then please come this way.</b>

02:12.440 --> 02:17.440
<b>The x Guard's x Duty</b>

02:19.690 --> 02:22.010
<b>Gon and his friends have confronted</b>

<b>the obstacles that they must overcome</b>

02:24.330 --> 02:26.500
<b>in order to meet with Killua.</b>

02:27.140 --> 02:31.430
<b>What awaits them at their destination?</b>

02:34.380 --> 02:37.460
<b>Here are the servants' quarters.</b>

02:37.460 --> 02:39.030
<b>It's getting late.</b>

02:39.800 --> 02:41.760
<b>So you can stay here tonight.</b>

02:48.860 --> 02:50.300
<b>Please come in.</b>

02:53.240 --> 02:55.420
<b>Hey, I'm back!</b>

02:55.960 --> 02:59.070
<b>Oh, you rarely bring guests.</b>

02:59.830 --> 03:01.820
<b>This is Seaquant.</b>

03:01.820 --> 03:04.620
<b>He works with me here.</b>

03:04.930 --> 03:06.150
<b>Good evening.</b>

03:09.220 --> 03:12.500
<b>If you managed to win over Zebro, 
you must be special.</b>

03:13.150 --> 03:14.660
<b>Well, make yourselves at home.</b>

03:14.660 --> 03:17.670
<b>Though it won't be easy here.</b>

03:21.250 --> 03:23.350
<b>You want to see young Killua?</b>

03:26.070 --> 03:27.720
<b>That's a riot!</b>

03:27.720 --> 03:29.870
<b>Sorry. But we're dead serious.</b>

03:30.360 --> 03:32.130
<b>Then let me give you a warning:</b>

03:32.130 --> 03:34.230
<b>Give up, and go home.</b>

03:34.520 --> 03:36.010
<b>What was that?!</b>

03:36.010 --> 03:38.690
<b>Zebro told you about the 
Testing Gate, right?</b>

03:38.690 --> 03:42.230
<b>That should give you an idea of 
what this place is like.</b>

03:42.770 --> 03:45.570
<b>We understand that it won't be easy.</b>

03:46.240 --> 03:48.540
<b>But I'm not leaving.</b>

03:49.650 --> 03:51.580
<b>Not until I see Killua!</b>

03:54.150 --> 03:59.090
<b>When Killua was in trouble, 
I wasn't there for him.</b>

04:05.810 --> 04:09.400
<b>If I had been there,</b>

04:10.620 --> 04:12.910
<b>I could have stopped Killua!</b>

04:14.840 --> 04:18.650
<b>Killua is my close friend!</b>

04:23.970 --> 04:25.500
<b>We understand.</b>

04:25.830 --> 04:29.160
<b>Then why not do some training here?</b>

04:29.160 --> 04:30.490
<b>Training?</b>

04:30.490 --> 04:31.640
<b>Hey, Zebro...</b>

04:32.130 --> 04:33.790
<b>Listen to me, Gon-kun.</b>

04:33.790 --> 04:36.840
<b>You three are allowed to work together</b>

04:36.840 --> 04:38.540
<b>to open the door.</b>

04:39.590 --> 04:42.800
<b>With a little training, it should be possible.</b>

04:43.930 --> 04:45.050
<b>How about it?</b>

04:47.720 --> 04:49.900
<b>I don't like the idea of being tested...</b>

04:50.750 --> 04:52.930
<b>But if there is no other way...</b>

04:53.510 --> 04:55.730
<b>We'll just have to do it!</b>

04:55.990 --> 04:57.150
<b>Yep!</b>

04:57.150 --> 05:00.960
<b>Then I'll need you to put these on.</b>

05:07.680 --> 05:10.160
<b>How is this so heavy...</b>

05:10.460 --> 05:12.480
<b>It weighs fifty kilograms.</b>

05:12.480 --> 05:15.600
<b>Please wear it at all times, 
except while you sleep.</b>

05:16.470 --> 05:18.620
<b>I'll make it heavier as you get used to it.</b>

05:20.770 --> 05:22.870
<b>Please have some tea.</b>

05:26.360 --> 05:27.170
<b>What the...?</b>

05:28.250 --> 05:30.370
<b>The cups weigh twenty kilograms.</b>

05:30.370 --> 05:32.420
<b>This teapot weighs forty kilograms.</b>

05:33.290 --> 05:35.380
<b>All furniture and utensils in this house</b>

05:35.380 --> 05:37.860
<b>weigh over twenty kilograms apiece.</b>

05:37.860 --> 05:41.040
<b>I see... So this will serve as training.</b>

05:41.040 --> 05:42.440
<b>It's useless.</b>

05:42.930 --> 05:45.780
<b>They'll give up in two or three days.</b>

05:45.780 --> 05:46.760
<b>What was that?</b>

05:46.760 --> 05:51.290
<b>Seaquant, I believe that 
your shift has already started.</b>

05:51.290 --> 05:53.100
<b>Oh, that's right...</b>

05:55.740 --> 05:57.110
<b>Sorry about that.</b>

05:57.110 --> 05:59.200
<b>He isn't a bad person.</b>

05:59.200 --> 06:01.520
<b>By the way, where's the bathroom?</b>

06:01.520 --> 06:03.590
<b>Through the door over there.</b>

06:06.780 --> 06:08.220
<b>I'm guessing that</b>

06:08.220 --> 06:10.090
<b>the door is also...</b>

06:10.090 --> 06:13.350
<b>Yes, it weighs five hundred kilograms.</b>

06:13.650 --> 06:15.100
<b>Five hundred?</b>

06:15.850 --> 06:18.470
<b>What?! Get out!</b>

06:18.470 --> 06:22.000
<b>I can't hold it in!</b>

06:51.590 --> 06:53.640
<b>Kalluto-chan, open the door.</b>

07:02.740 --> 07:05.530
<b>Kil, have you learned your lesson yet?</b>

07:05.530 --> 07:07.000
<b>It's no use, Mama.</b>

07:07.000 --> 07:09.150
<b>He isn't even the least bit sorry.</b>

07:09.660 --> 07:11.660
<b>We need to make him suffer more.</b>

07:13.040 --> 07:15.570
<b>Milluki! Shut your mouth!</b>

07:17.050 --> 07:22.540
<b>Kil, stop being so stubborn 
and say that you're sorry.</b>

07:24.150 --> 07:26.620
<b>Oh, right. That friend of yours...</b>

07:26.620 --> 07:28.170
<b>Gon, was it?</b>

07:28.720 --> 07:30.420
<b>He'd be better off just leaving,</b>

07:30.810 --> 07:33.510
<b>but it sounds like he wants 
to try the Testing Gate.</b>

07:35.440 --> 07:37.930
<b>Gon is here...</b>

07:38.370 --> 07:40.630
<b>Milluki! You're talking too much!</b>

07:41.210 --> 07:42.700
<b>Listen to me, Kil...</b>

07:42.700 --> 07:44.460
<b>You didn't even tell me?!</b>

07:46.020 --> 07:48.600
<b>Don't yell at Mama!</b>

07:48.600 --> 07:50.360
<b>I told you to shut your mouth!</b>

07:51.110 --> 07:53.920
<b>I didn't think I needed to tell you, Kil...</b>

07:53.920 --> 07:57.230
<b>Since it's impossible for him 
to open the front gate.</b>

07:57.230 --> 07:58.160
<b>He'll do it.</b>

07:58.160 --> 07:58.740
<b>What?</b>

07:59.570 --> 08:01.750
<b>Gon will open it.</b>

08:03.380 --> 08:06.120
<b>Oh, that's nice.</b>

08:06.120 --> 08:09.940
<b>But he'll still never make it here...</b>

08:09.940 --> 08:11.010
<b>Gon will...</b>

08:11.830 --> 08:14.340
<b>He'll do it.</b>

08:15.320 --> 08:18.520
<b>He will definitely make it here.</b>

08:31.820 --> 08:33.150
<b>Wait, Gon!</b>

08:33.150 --> 08:34.920
<b>You just watch.</b>

08:34.920 --> 08:36.840
<b>Huh? Why?</b>

08:36.840 --> 08:39.430
<b>You need to let your arm heal first.</b>

08:39.430 --> 08:42.660
<b>As long as Kurapika and I can open it, 
it doesn't matter.</b>

08:42.660 --> 08:44.120
<b>Let us handle this!</b>

08:45.160 --> 08:46.170
<b>Okay.</b>

08:47.720 --> 08:49.060
<b>Let's do this, Kurapika!</b>

08:49.060 --> 08:50.150
<b>Yeah!</b>

08:56.090 --> 08:58.550
<b>It's impossible...</b>

09:03.420 --> 09:05.580
<b>No use... It won't budge an inch.</b>

09:05.580 --> 09:07.060
<b>Damn!</b>

09:07.460 --> 09:10.620
<b>But we just started our training.</b>

09:10.620 --> 09:12.470
<b>If we work hard enough, we can do it!</b>

09:12.470 --> 09:15.070
<b>I wish I could share your optimism.</b>

10:07.820 --> 10:10.160
<b>This will never work.</b>

10:10.160 --> 10:11.880
<b>You kids need to wake up.</b>

10:12.230 --> 10:13.870
<b>In that case,</b>

10:13.870 --> 10:16.680
<b>you should quit watching us 
and do your job!</b>

10:18.720 --> 10:20.590
<b>Gon is one of us.</b>

10:22.690 --> 10:26.600
<b>And he wishes to see his friend.</b>

10:26.980 --> 10:30.100
<b>It's only right that we should help him.</b>

10:34.270 --> 10:36.470
<b>Okay, let's give it another shot!</b>

10:36.470 --> 10:37.610
<b>Yeah!</b>

10:45.630 --> 10:49.370
<b>Man, you can't just mindlessly push.</b>

10:50.330 --> 10:52.080
<b>Match your timing.</b>

10:52.610 --> 10:56.380
<b>You have to push both doors, 
with all your strength, simultaneously.</b>

10:56.380 --> 10:58.790
<b>Or the gate won't ever open.</b>

11:02.700 --> 11:04.900
<b>Match our timing...</b>

11:04.900 --> 11:08.900
<b>And push both doors with all our 
strength simultaneously...</b>

11:09.340 --> 11:10.340
<b>Okay!</b>

11:11.800 --> 11:12.900
<b>One!</b>

11:13.120 --> 11:13.900
<b>Two!</b>

11:13.900 --> 11:14.900
<b>Three!</b>

11:25.230 --> 11:27.540
<b>Leorio! Kurapika!</b>

11:32.600 --> 11:34.290
<b>It moved.</b>

11:43.070 --> 11:53.150
<b>Hunter Vocabulary</b>

11:49.100 --> 11:53.150
<b>Testing Gate</b>

11:58.830 --> 11:59.830
<b>What?</b>

12:01.120 --> 12:03.110
<b>The Testing Gate?</b>

12:06.120 --> 12:07.280
<b>And?</b>

12:07.280 --> 12:08.680
<b>Oh, well...</b>

12:08.680 --> 12:11.280
<b>I just wanted to let you know.</b>

12:11.860 --> 12:12.790
<b>Very well.</b>

12:15.690 --> 12:18.170
<b>He's always so cold.</b>

12:36.910 --> 12:41.440
<b>Hey, why don't you try removing 
those vests today?</b>

12:41.820 --> 12:44.200
<b>Oh? Music to my ears!</b>

12:47.070 --> 12:48.380
<b>Yeah!</b>

12:48.380 --> 12:50.760
<b>Without them, we can 
definitely open the gate now.</b>

12:54.770 --> 12:56.500
<b>Let's do this, Kurapika!</b>

12:56.500 --> 12:57.280
<b>Yeah!</b>

12:57.700 --> 12:59.210
<b>One... Two...</b>

12:59.660 --> 13:00.210
<b>Three!</b>

13:22.980 --> 13:24.450
<b>Damn it...</b>

13:24.450 --> 13:26.110
<b>It won't move any farther.</b>

13:28.600 --> 13:30.730
<b>One last spurt, Leorio...</b>

13:30.730 --> 13:32.490
<b>Got it!</b>

13:35.440 --> 13:36.320
<b>Gon...</b>

13:36.320 --> 13:39.350
<b>Why are you using your left arm?</b>

13:39.350 --> 13:40.250
<b>It's okay.</b>

13:40.250 --> 13:41.750
<b>My arm's healed now.</b>

13:41.750 --> 13:43.370
<b>Healed?</b>

13:43.370 --> 13:44.890
<b>Are you sure, Gon?</b>

13:44.890 --> 13:46.010
<b>Yep!</b>

13:46.010 --> 13:48.890
<b>Anyway, we have to push together, right?</b>

13:51.110 --> 13:52.680
<b>Right, let's push!</b>

13:53.360 --> 13:54.020
<b>Here we go!</b>

13:54.350 --> 13:55.020
<b>One!</b>

13:55.260 --> 13:56.020
<b>Two!</b>

13:56.360 --> 13:57.270
<b>Three!</b>

14:06.630 --> 14:07.540
<b>It's opening...</b>

14:12.930 --> 14:14.610
<b>Ow...</b>

14:19.760 --> 14:21.130
<b>It opened.</b>

14:24.110 --> 14:25.900
<b>Yes!</b>

14:25.900 --> 14:27.710
<b>We did it, Gon!</b>

14:27.710 --> 14:28.760
<b>Uh-huh!</b>

14:32.970 --> 14:35.980
<b>Follow the path, and head for the mountain.</b>

14:35.980 --> 14:38.770
<b>The mansion should be somewhere up there.</b>

14:39.490 --> 14:41.110
<b>I'm ashamed to admit</b>

14:41.110 --> 14:43.810
<b>that even though I've worked 
here for twenty years,</b>

14:43.810 --> 14:45.630
<b>I've never been up the mountain.</b>

14:45.630 --> 14:47.900
<b>Sorry that I couldn't be any help.</b>

14:47.900 --> 14:49.660
<b>No, that isn't true.</b>

14:50.080 --> 14:53.300
<b>You've both been a huge help.</b>

14:55.650 --> 14:57.230
<b>Thank you for everything!</b>

14:58.140 --> 14:59.410
<b>Goodbye!</b>

15:04.930 --> 15:07.170
<b>Those kids are really something.</b>

15:07.490 --> 15:11.140
<b>They might be able to 
make it to the mansion.</b>

15:12.540 --> 15:15.380
<b>Won't happen. They'll just 
get themselves killed.</b>

15:15.380 --> 15:18.180
<b>Speaking from your experience 
three years ago?</b>

15:26.770 --> 15:30.700
<b>We were wiped out by an apprentice butler.</b>

15:31.350 --> 15:34.520
<b>That made it painfully clear</b>

15:34.520 --> 15:37.200
<b>that I wasn't on their level.</b>

15:37.530 --> 15:41.210
<b>So you decided to work here.</b>

15:42.050 --> 15:43.680
<b>Sorry...</b>

15:45.600 --> 15:49.870
<b>But the masters and servants 
are all monsters.</b>

15:49.870 --> 15:52.470
<b>Once you step into their territory...</b>

15:55.610 --> 15:57.560
<b>The Testing Gate opened?</b>

15:58.030 --> 15:59.060
<b>Yes, ma'am.</b>

15:59.060 --> 16:01.500
<b>This is a critical time for Killua.</b>

16:01.500 --> 16:03.440
<b>We cannot allow anyone near him!</b>

16:04.140 --> 16:08.580
<b>Especially not those unnecessary friends...</b>

16:08.580 --> 16:09.680
<b>Do you understand?</b>

16:10.150 --> 16:11.160
<b>Yes, ma'am.</b>

16:26.010 --> 16:27.250
<b>Leave.</b>

16:27.730 --> 16:30.010
<b>You're trespassing on private property.</b>

16:30.420 --> 16:33.320
<b>I cannot allow you to pass 
without permission.</b>

16:33.320 --> 16:34.970
<b>We called ahead.</b>

16:34.970 --> 16:36.760
<b>And we came through the Testing Gate.</b>

16:37.320 --> 16:40.450
<b>The butlers did not give you 
permission to enter.</b>

16:40.910 --> 16:43.110
<b>What do we need to do to get permission?</b>

16:43.110 --> 16:45.520
<b>I said I was Killua's friend, 
but they wouldn't put him on.</b>

16:46.040 --> 16:47.210
<b>I wouldn't know.</b>

16:47.210 --> 16:49.070
<b>Because no one has ever 
received permission.</b>

16:49.520 --> 16:52.110
<b>Then we'll have to trespass!</b>

16:52.860 --> 16:54.330
<b>I suppose so.</b>

16:54.810 --> 16:58.460
<b>In any case, this is where I draw the line.</b>

16:59.870 --> 17:02.060
<b>If you take one step beyond this line,</b>

17:02.060 --> 17:03.540
<b>I'll remove you by force.</b>

17:20.890 --> 17:21.770
<b>Gon!</b>

17:21.770 --> 17:23.090
<b>Damn it!</b>

17:24.350 --> 17:26.380
<b>Leorio! Kurapika!</b>

17:27.260 --> 17:29.020
<b>Don't interfere.</b>

17:29.020 --> 17:30.270
<b>Let me handle this.</b>

17:30.570 --> 17:32.760
<b>Ow...</b>

17:32.760 --> 17:35.960
<b>We don't intend to fight you.</b>

17:36.530 --> 17:38.660
<b>We just want to see Killua.</b>

17:39.340 --> 17:41.660
<b>It doesn't matter what your motives are.</b>

17:42.120 --> 17:45.660
<b>I'm simply following my orders.</b>

18:05.370 --> 18:06.850
<b>You can try all you want.</b>

18:12.910 --> 18:14.610
<b>I'll never let you pass.</b>

18:16.670 --> 18:18.860
<b>I will pass...</b>

18:19.320 --> 18:21.240
<b>I'm going to see Killua!</b>

18:29.440 --> 18:30.580
<b><i>Welcome home,</i></b>

18:32.170 --> 18:33.460
<b><i>Killua-sama.</i></b>

18:35.840 --> 18:36.730
<b><i>Yeah.</i></b>

18:41.370 --> 18:42.640
<b><i>I made...</i></b>

18:45.760 --> 18:47.600
<b><i>a friend...</i></b>

19:35.860 --> 19:37.280
<b>Stop it.</b>

19:38.620 --> 19:40.150
<b>Stay away!</b>

19:47.320 --> 19:49.000
<b>Cut it out!</b>

19:49.000 --> 19:50.740
<b>Don't you realize how futile this is?!</b>

19:50.740 --> 19:52.110
<b>Why don't you stop him?</b>

19:52.110 --> 19:52.710
<b>Aren't you his friends?</b>

20:00.130 --> 20:01.720
<b>What's the problem?</b>

20:02.220 --> 20:04.470
<b>I'm just here to see my friend.</b>

20:05.200 --> 20:07.470
<b>I'm just here to see Killua!</b>

20:08.830 --> 20:12.160
<b>Why do I have to do this?!</b>

20:21.740 --> 20:22.380
<b>Hey.</b>

20:22.380 --> 20:23.410
<b>Huh?</b>

20:23.410 --> 20:24.990
<b>I crossed the line.</b>

20:25.510 --> 20:26.740
<b>Aren't you supposed to hit me?</b>

20:29.040 --> 20:31.370
<b>You're different from Mike.</b>

20:32.020 --> 20:34.580
<b>You may try to hide your feelings,</b>

20:34.580 --> 20:36.130
<b>but you have a heart.</b>

20:36.600 --> 20:41.510
<b>When I mentioned Killua, 
your eyes softened for a moment.</b>

20:49.820 --> 20:50.830
<b>Please...</b>

20:52.370 --> 20:55.810
<b>Help Killua-sama—</b>

21:03.410 --> 21:04.610
<b>Honestly...</b>

21:04.610 --> 21:07.500
<b>What was that servant babbling about?</b>

21:08.580 --> 21:11.750
<b>She made it sound like we're 
being mean to Killua.</b>

21:13.640 --> 21:16.430
<b>A worthless apprentice had 
the nerve to insult us!</b>

21:18.300 --> 21:20.050
<b>You must be Gon.</b>

21:20.050 --> 21:22.400
<b>I heard about you from Illumi.</b>

21:22.400 --> 21:26.010
<b>Killua knows that you're here.</b>

21:27.950 --> 21:31.140
<b>I have a message for you from Kil...</b>

21:32.690 --> 21:34.730
<b>"Thank you for coming.</b>

21:34.730 --> 21:36.870
<b>I really appreciate it.</b>

21:36.870 --> 21:39.120
<b>But I can't see you right now.</b>

21:39.850 --> 21:41.110
<b>Sorry."</b>

21:44.320 --> 21:47.480
<b>Gon and his friends have finally made it 
inside the Zoldyck estate.</b>

21:47.480 --> 21:51.320
<b>But now, they face their 
greatest obstacle yet.</b>

21:52.160 --> 21:55.390
<b>A sad message from Killua,</b>

21:55.390 --> 21:58.300
<b>saying that he can't see them.</b>

23:27.630 --> 23:30.380
<b>Next time: The x Zoldyck x Family!</b>

23:30.380 --> 23:32.770
<b>What is Killua to you?</b>

23:32.770 --> 23:34.370
<b>My big brother!</b>
