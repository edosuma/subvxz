and read too many sexy books.

16:34.077 --> 16:36.830
- This is Hollywood's fault!
The Joker! The Joker!

16:36.830 --> 16:39.291
- Let's go get Todd Phillips
and sacrifice him to the steam.

16:39.291 --> 16:41.877
I bet he lives in a Tony Stark-style house
overlooking the bay.

16:41.877 --> 16:43.212
- Will you aliens shut the fuck up?

16:43.212 --> 16:44.463
[growls]

16:44.463 --> 16:46.173
- Venmo me!

16:47.132 --> 16:50.427
- I am so sick of listening
to you blame everyone else.

16:50.427 --> 16:52.012
This is on you.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.096
[all gasp]

16:53.096 --> 16:55.307
- I ship a thicc snack!

16:55.307 --> 16:56.850
[growls]
[all scream]

16:56.850 --> 16:59.394
- The Pupa wouldn't be acting like this

16:59.394 --> 17:01.188
if he had some structure in his life.

17:01.188 --> 17:03.440
He needs present,
tangible role models.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.901
- We see this all the time.
The problem starts at home.

17:05.901 --> 17:07.819
- Home? But that's where we are.

17:07.819 --> 17:12.324
- Oh my god, you are truly
the shittiest parents I have ever met.

17:12.324 --> 17:14.409
Korvo has spent more time
eating me out

17:14.409 --> 17:15.953
than being involved
in the Pupa's education.

17:15.953 --> 17:17.538
- Exactly. Wait, what?

17:17.538 --> 17:19.248
- Well, guess what,
you're fucking wrong,

17:19.248 --> 17:20.624
because we're not human parents.

17:20.624 --> 17:22.084
The Pupa is a member
of our team.

17:22.084 --> 17:23.794
- Do you feed him?
Do you bathe him?

17:23.794 --> 17:26.421
Do you lay in bed at night and worry
he's gonna get run over by a car

17:26.421 --> 17:27.422
or kidnapped by a pervert?

17:27.422 --> 17:31.260
- No, I worry he's gonna get kidnapped
by a car and run over by a pervert,

17:31.260 --> 17:33.303
but now that I'm saying it
out loud, yes.

17:33.303 --> 17:35.013
- Then, honey, you are parents.

17:35.013 --> 17:38.934
All the Pupa does is watch you dumbassses
run around sci-fi'ing shit

17:38.934 --> 17:40.269
with no consequences.

17:40.269 --> 17:41.979
You are the bad influences.

17:41.979 --> 17:45.107
He doesn't have to change,
you do.

17:46.441 --> 17:48.986
- Fuck that. It's not us.
Let's go kill Todd Phillips!

17:48.986 --> 17:50.070
- Woo!
- Yeah, let's get him!

17:50.070 --> 17:51.196
[bellowing]

17:54.032 --> 17:56.326
- Ugh. I hate Earth.
It's a horrible home.

17:56.326 --> 17:58.620
We have to fix the ship.
We're out of Doritos.

17:58.620 --> 17:59.788
Fuck you, Terry.

18:00.622 --> 18:04.710
- Guys, that Supreme steam monster
sounds exactly like us.

18:04.710 --> 18:08.005
- Holy shit. Were we
the Todd Phillips all along?

18:08.005 --> 18:10.507
MONSTER: I want to trap someone
in a paperweight!

18:10.507 --> 18:12.176
- Aw, geez, we suck.

18:12.176 --> 18:14.887
- I can't believe it, but these two
shallow side characters were right.

18:14.887 --> 18:15.929
[laser zaps]

18:18.307 --> 18:20.684
- Regular Hungry Hungry Hippos? Ew.

18:20.684 --> 18:22.019
- Come on,
we have to play. Now!

18:22.019 --> 18:23.061
- Really?
- Yes!

18:23.896 --> 18:26.064
[rattling]

18:26.815 --> 18:28.150
- This is fucking boring.

18:28.150 --> 18:29.484
It was better
when we turned them into--

18:29.484 --> 18:31.111
- Look! What's happening?

18:31.111 --> 18:33.739
- The Pupa is reacting to us
being bland and normal. See?

18:33.739 --> 18:35.824
JESSE:
Oh yeah! I guess it's working.

18:35.824 --> 18:38.160
- From this moment forward,
we have to change our ways.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.370
- So no more awesome sci-fi stuff?

18:40.370 --> 18:42.915
- No. I think we have
to cut everything from our lives

18:42.915 --> 18:45.626
that makes us a special,
unique, weird family

18:45.626 --> 18:48.003
and basically sand
our whole situation down

18:48.003 --> 18:51.465
so it's palatable to a broader,
more corporate-approved audience,

18:51.465 --> 18:52.799
I mean, the Pupa.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.635
- I just signed up for
a Mommy and Me music class

18:54.635 --> 18:55.928
with the Pupa three days a week.

18:55.928 --> 18:57.679
And then I guess we'll go get
no sugar added,

18:57.679 --> 18:59.765
lactose free fro-yo
with the other moms.

18:59.765 --> 19:02.518
- Oh my lilies, he's firming up.
What else can we do?

19:02.518 --> 19:04.645
- We could go back to school
and actually give a shit?

19:04.645 --> 19:06.271
JESSE:
Keep going, keep going!

19:06.271 --> 19:09.942
- Terry and I can get jobs. Real ones.
Not comedy writing or firemen.

19:09.942 --> 19:11.735
Something in an office.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:11.735 --> 19:15.572
With desks. And a computer and a printer
and a receptionist named Gayle

19:15.572 --> 19:17.199
that I keep trying to bang,
but she won't let me hit it!

19:17.199 --> 19:18.742
- We can do this.
For the Pupa!

19:18.742 --> 19:20.244

I think Jenkins ran
all the numbers wrong.

Dinner will be ready in ten.

Okay.

20:37.654 --> 20:39.656
Ugh. That was Mr. Sarner.

20:39.656 --> 20:41.491
He invited himself and his wife
over for dinner,

20:41.491 --> 20:42.743
and they want veal parmesan.

20:42.743 --> 20:46.163
- But I'm making ginger-glazed salmon
with a cucumber dill salad.

veal fuckin' parmesan!

20:48.165 --> 20:50.959

or we'll get fired from our work job!

the stakes of our lives now?

20:54.004 --> 20:57.257
Remember when we saved humanity
from ice lava and napadoodles

20:57.257 --> 20:59.510
and fought over who had
more Christmas spirit?

- I spent 14 minutes in heaven
with a janky BTS!

21:02.804 --> 21:06.183

to fight my ex-lover Malcolm Gladwell!

- Oh, those were the days.

21:07.559 --> 21:09.978
We used to do so much crazy
sci-fi stuff.

21:12.773 --> 21:14.525
