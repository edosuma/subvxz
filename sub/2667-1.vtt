Welcome

04:21.279 --> 04:25.524
THE MOTHER OF ALL TOADS

04:41.920 --> 04:45.811
Here we were in France with all
Types of gargoyles on the wall.

04:45.846 --> 04:47.768
- Honey, can we go?
- That's so impressive.

04:47.920 --> 04:51.925
This is the "Green Man" is a
pagan fertility symbol.

04:52.160 --> 04:56.324
You you have to watch the time.
They're so cool.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.125
- Be careful.
- What?

04:58.160 --> 05:00.242
If you have touched it
they might buy.

05:00.277 --> 05:04.723
It may very
like to try once.

05:05.400 --> 05:06.925
Thank you.

05:07.200 --> 05:10.249
- Thank you.
- Are you American?

05:10.400 --> 05:11.242
Yes.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.448
Enter
wonderful couple from.

05:13.800 --> 05:15.962
- Thank you.
- Darling, you're wonderful.

05:16.120 --> 05:17.770
- Let's see.
- I want her.

05:19.200 --> 05:22.647
- Do you like it?
This is the "older characters'.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.809
What're you talking about?

05:25.120 --> 05:27.964
The "ÄItere characters'
of H.P. Lovecraft.

05:28.320 --> 05:31.961
- The Necronomicon and stuff.
- Yes, you're right.

05:32.720 --> 05:35.121
- Was not that a hoax?
- Of course not.

05:35.360 --> 05:38.330
They come from a very old source,

05:38.680 --> 05:43.368
which has been for generations
Part of my family is.

05:43.680 --> 05:45.682
And I explore traditions, but fits.

05:45.717 --> 05:47.762
He calls anthropology.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.370
If you are interested, have
You come this afternoon.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.167
Honey, we can not
Afternoon. We already have plans.

05:56.400 --> 05:59.563
This is on our way.
I think we get back.

05:59.920 --> 06:02.446
Which we will discuss in the car.

06:03.920 --> 06:08.005
Is that enough? It is
only slightly wrinkled.

06:43.120 --> 06:45.088
It's French.
I do not understand.

06:45.320 --> 06:49.803
Yes, we're in France.
You have to get used to you.

06:50.400 --> 06:53.563
Otherwise, would you rather have in
should remain the States.

06:57.360 --> 07:00.250
Okay, listen, honey, I mean ...

07:00.600 --> 07:02.685
Why do not you go to the spa?

07:02.720 --> 07:06.247
And on the way you bring me
then decreases. It is on the way.

07:07.080 --> 07:10.243
Do not you see, she says, that she
a copy of the Necronomicon has.

07:10.278 --> 07:13.485
That I have to check,
why I'm here.

07:13.520 --> 07:17.565
She has a copy on a
Found market in Mirepoix.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.762
I need to go there. It is perhaps
just another fake.

07:20.240 --> 07:23.784
I have to check it. So do
your thing. Let you make the nails,

07:23.819 --> 07:27.329
go to the hammam. That's okay. But
Now let's enjoy the ride.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.607
We could turn left at Benet
should, as I had said.

07:54.642 --> 07:57.490
I am now, I am left
bent to Benet.

07:57.720 --> 08:02.886
No. Turn left at Benet
You listen to me not.

08:03.160 --> 08:05.606
- Baby ...
- Just keep driving.

08:07.640 --> 08:10.120
- What the hell is that?
- What?

08:34.320 --> 08:38.769
Wow. Look das. you
You show your face on.

08:39.440 --> 08:42.489
- Yes, 5 is a cross.
- This is not just a cross.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.722
It belongs not to the intersection.

08:45.120 --> 08:48.283
Over here was a spiritual ver-
collection site from the time of the Gauls.

08:48.520 --> 08:51.808
Well, you would have our favorite
Holiday paid more attention ...

08:52.160 --> 08:54.003
Then ... we would not have moved.
- Proceed?

08:54.360 --> 08:58.001
Yes! Where are we? What is it for
a place? I do not understand.

08:58.240 --> 09:00.242
We have not lost our way.
Do not you see what goes here?

09:00.277 --> 09:01.969
You Look at the sign,
the market.

09:02.200 --> 09:05.363
The woman has a Necronomicon and
Earrings with the "ÄIteren characters."

09:06.440 --> 09:09.091
This is the symbol of infinity.

09:09.360 --> 09:14.446
You see, that is the co-
connection of two worlds, heaven and earth.

09:16.360 --> 09:19.409
- Yes, it's a fucking night.
What are you talking about? - An eight.

09:19.640 --> 09:22.325
I'm going to Spa.

09:22.920 --> 09:26.242
- You can do what you want.
- This is not a fucking night ...

10:11.960 --> 10:15.203
I see are
They come alone.

10:16.240 --> 10:19.050
Karina had an appointment.

10:19.240 --> 10:22.210
You probably do not heal your interests?

10:23.080 --> 10:26.163
She does not think much of esotericism.

10:31.640 --> 10:33.608
Sit down.

10:39.960 --> 10:41.849
A Pastis from the area.

10:44.080 --> 10:47.607
That is the custom in the region.

10:57.440 --> 11:01.206
The book is very old.

11:08.760 --> 11:12.526
I can not believe it,
but it looks real.

11:15.760 --> 11:20.448
All the women in my family
have used it.

11:20.483 --> 11:24.525
In one way or
the other way.

11:29.080 --> 11:30.605
Oh God ...

11:31.080 --> 11:33.048
Great.

11:34.640 --> 11:36.927
Fantastic. what is it?

11:43.880 --> 11:47.407
The mothers of all the toads.

12:56.280 --> 12:59.921
Do you really have
Go, my boy?

13:00.160 --> 13:05.041
- Yes, it's pretty late.
- Then one more for the road.

13:05.280 --> 13:10.320
The wine is mild you
warm on your way back.

13:10.960 --> 13:12.724
I will not refuse.

13:17.040 --> 13:23.525
It is your stomach
warming and other parts.

13:23.760 --> 13:26.240
I should go now.

13:38.640 --> 13:44.170
Do you like me now, handsome?

14:09.840 --> 14:11.649
Shit.

14:12.360 --> 14:16.251
One day I will have to
something to kill.

19:46.360 --> 19:48.249
What the.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.531
No ...

20:23.360 --> 20:28.241
Why are you in such a hurry
gone, little one?

20:29.560 --> 20:32.723
Stay away from me.
Stay away.

20:33.080 --> 20:36.050
Why?

20:36.760 --> 20:41.243
I can give you everything
give other women and more.

20:41.480 --> 20:45.166
You are not a fucking woman!
You're a fucking freak!

21:36.360 --> 21:37.771
No ...

21:45.160 --> 21:47.128
No, no, no ...

21:50.400 --> 21:52.846
you

22:46.080 --> 22:49.163
What a story.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.162
As imaginative.

22:52.560 --> 22:57.122
Not every horror is
a creation of the divine.

23:14.560 --> 23:19.361
I LOVE YOU

24:12.080 --> 24:13.969
Shit.

24:14.280 --> 24:17.966
Hi, it's me.
Call me back, please.

24:18.720 --> 24:20.643
It is important.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.644
Hey, George, it's me.

24:24.880 --> 24:27.963
I'm with an ugly
Section woken by the hand.

24:27.998 --> 24:29.928
A broken glass or something.

24:30.160 --> 24:33.926
Maybe I'm in a fight
advised. I can not remember.

24:35.760 --> 24:40.084
I can not get Mona.
She does not answer my calls.

24:51.320 --> 24:53.368
He does not sound very good.

24:53.600 --> 24:56.888
Yesterday he had a fight and
can not even remember.

24:57.200 --> 25:01.444
I'll talk to him, a few things
pack up and be right back.

25:01.479 --> 25:03.408
I do not think this is a good idea.

25:03.960 --> 25:06.660
We should immediately go to Paris

25:06.695 --> 25:09.360
We settle down and disappear.

25:09.680 --> 25:12.285
He would look for me.

25:12.320 --> 25:14.846
That you're not, right?

25:16.880 --> 25:20.441
I will bring him even to
that he understands.

25:20.600 --> 25:23.080
Trust me, okay?

25:34.400 --> 25:36.368
My God, where have you been?

25:36.720 --> 25:39.690
Why did not you answer the phone
gone or have called me back?

25:39.920 --> 25:43.367
I've told you a few days ago,
I'm going to my cousin.

25:43.402 --> 25:45.761
You two are not answered the phone.

25:46.160 --> 25:47.844
I have dozens of you
Leave messages.

25:48.080 --> 25:51.562
I needed some time
for me to think.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.651
- And you?
- Yes, I have. It was good.

25:54.880 --> 25:58.566
- That I had to do.
- Well, that makes me happy.

25:58.720 --> 26:00.848
Because I love you so much missing.

26:01.800 --> 26:03.290
What are you doing?

26:03.520 --> 26:06.285
I pack a few things
together, then we can talk.

26:06.520 --> 26:11.481
Why do you need to pack stuff?
You'll stay at home now, right?

26:11.840 --> 26:16.084
So simple is not the
I have to decide yet.

26:17.760 --> 26:19.805
Damn it ...

26:19.840 --> 26:23.481
What I have done such a terrible thing?
Please, tell me!

26:23.840 --> 26:27.561
You did not do anything. It is
to me. Try to understand it.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.482
I'm trying,
But you say nothing at all!

26:34.920 --> 26:37.685
Cut the crap
and look at me!

26:41.240 --> 26:42.890
[What?

26:43.320 --> 26:47.769
- You wear your wedding ring not. - I
know I've forgotten it at Danielle.

26:47.920 --> 26:49.570
I'll get him,
when I go back.

26:50.040 --> 26:52.771
You're not going anywhere, you are to
told you what's going on!

26:53.240 --> 26:57.564
Do you want me now hold captive?
Why will not you grow up?

26:58.960 --> 27:01.930
Stop it!

27:02.960 --> 27:04.405
You ...

27:04.440 --> 27:07.444
Bastard!
You are a real pig!

27:08.400 --> 27:12.724
You were the last five days
not with Danielle! Where were you?

27:12.759 --> 27:16.486
- You're being paranoid.
- You were not there, I know.

27:16.720 --> 27:18.688
You controlled me?

27:19.640 --> 27:24.123
I have to worry
you made. I love you.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.207
You poor fool.

27:38.360 --> 27:41.011
Do you not understand why
I can not stay here?

27:41.360 --> 27:44.011
- Because you kill me.
- How do I kill you?

27:44.240 --> 27:47.445
You do not even lets
for a minute alone.

27:47.480 --> 27:50.165
When I go out, you want to know
where I'm going ...

27:50.320 --> 27:52.482
What I do ... and
when I go back.

27:52.640 --> 27:54.802
If I'm late,
I must explain myself.

27:55.360 --> 27:58.887
I meet someone, you want to know
who it is and what we talked about.

27:59.120 --> 28:02.203
- Do not have a right to know,
with whom my wife talking about? - No!

28:02.920 --> 28:06.003
You call me 20 times a day
to just to check me.

28:06.240 --> 28:08.125
I want to say hi.

28:08.160 --> 28:11.607
And I'm sick of it, that you always
happened to be there, where am I going to show up.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.850
At first I liked the
Attention. It was nice.

28:18.080 --> 28:21.402
But now it's too much,
I can no longer live.

28:22.360 --> 28:25.405
You want to have someone
which is always there for you.

28:25.440 --> 28:30.162
The only live for you. Well,
I'm not. So nobody.

28:39.760 --> 28:43.082
I know you're right.
I'm neurotic.

28:44.440 --> 28:47.808
But only because I
love you so much.

28:48.560 --> 28:52.610
Stop saying that. Do
you even know what that means?

28:53.440 --> 28:57.047
It means that I love you.

29:00.280 --> 29:04.046
I'm sorry that it got this far
is. I wanted it to work.

29:04.360 --> 29:07.887
And we had a great time.
But I can not stay.

29:09.320 --> 29:10.367
[E-Please.

29:11.840 --> 29:15.890
- Give me one more chance.
- No, I can not.

29:16.240 --> 29:19.285
- Please, I'll do anything
what you want. - No.

29:19.320 --> 29:22.330
- I just do not rely on.
- No, you can not.

29:22.840 --> 29:25.005
- Axel ...
- Please, give me a kiss.

29:25.040 --> 29:29.523
- For the last time, then
you can go. - I'm leaving now.

29:37.640 --> 29:41.281
Please, darling, fuck me harder, okay?

29:41.316 --> 29:43.765
Come on!

29:43.800 --> 29:46.326
- I want to hurt you.
- I break not already!

29:46.560 --> 29:48.528
Come on, fuck me harder!

29:49.200 --> 29:52.283
Please, do not ruin me.

30:24.800 --> 30:28.850
Do you, do you love me still.

30:29.560 --> 30:33.326
- I'll still go.
- Why?

30:34.560 --> 30:36.289
I do not understand.

30:36.560 --> 30:39.882
We belong together. I can take you
happy, if you let me.

30:40.160 --> 30:42.128
No, that's not true.

30:43.360 --> 30:48.002
Please stay here and give us more
a chance. I'm begging you.

30:50.560 --> 30:52.528
I can not.

30:54.760 --> 30:59.243
If you met someone
all you need to tell me. I forgive you.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.971
Otherwise it makes no sense.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.970
Go into the living room.
I get to in a minute.

31:14.800 --> 31:18.725
I'll tell you everything, you know what
want to know. The absolute truth.

31:24.760 --> 31:27.730
I will not secretly
sneak out, I promise.

31:29.760 --> 31:31.569
Okay.

32:02.480 --> 32:05.131
That's so mean.

32:09.600 --> 32:12.365
You know where that leads, right?

32:13.680 --> 32:15.648
I think so.

32:18.280 --> 32:20.931
Because I'm falling straight into you.

32:21.280 --> 32:23.362
And I. In love with you

32:24.600 --> 32:29.561
Then everything is clear. We must
just move in together.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.970
We will get married and
spend our lives together.

32:33.200 --> 32:36.568
We will have a home and a family.
All that happy people have.

32:36.840 --> 32:38.808
I'd like that.

32:39.960 --> 32:42.645
- A friend of yours?
- Who?

32:43.080 --> 32:48.610
- The guy you smiled.
- No, I've never seen.

32:55.800 --> 32:58.770
So, the absolute truth, right?

33:03.480 --> 33:05.369
The truth ...

33:06.480 --> 33:10.485
I admit that I last
Week was not at my cousin.

33:10.680 --> 33:13.160
Yes, I was with someone
others together.

33:14.520 --> 33:18.923
I was unfaithful to you, and now I want to
that other person to be around.

33:19.120 --> 33:21.646
So I was not paranoid.

33:22.160 --> 33:25.562
Just because you were right, that means
not that you're not paranoid.

33:26.360 --> 33:29.489
- You admit that you deceived me?
- Yes.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.971
I cheated, I
I lied and cheated on you.

33:34.600 --> 33:39.288
- Who's this? - That 's got
nothing on. Nobody, you know.

33:39.520 --> 33:42.171
- Do you love him?
- Yes.

33:43.120 --> 33:44.849
Shit.

33:45.400 --> 33:48.370
Why did you tell me this
not been said before?

33:48.520 --> 33:50.363
Because I was afraid,
what would you do.

33:50.520 --> 33:53.569
- I would never want to hurt you, you know that
du - No, you hurt yourself Inst.

33:53.760 --> 33:55.364
You threaten with suicide.

33:55.920 --> 33:59.891
Have you throw a handful of pills
and make me responsible.

34:00.040 --> 34:02.964
- It was only once. - Yes, but
I've learned my lesson.

34:03.280 --> 34:05.681
How long has this been?

34:06.360 --> 34:08.681
The first time three years ago.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.969
- The first time?
- Yes, 6 were others.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.570
How many?

34:15.800 --> 34:18.963
Hard to say
One-night stands included?

34:19.239 --> 34:22.210
So, are you saying that
you're a whore and bitch?

34:22.600 --> 34:24.284
Yes.

34:25.320 --> 34:27.766
Do you remember the
internal bleeding that I had?

34:28.440 --> 34:32.485
- The uterine infection?
- I told you.

34:32.520 --> 34:37.003
- You need to eat something. - Sweet,
okay I go. I do not go hungry.

34:37.239 --> 34:39.288
I just want to sleep,
go into the other room.

34:39.520 --> 34:43.002
I stay here when you sleep
If you need anything.

34:43.520 --> 34:45.362
My lover then
was married.

34:45.719 --> 34:48.690
And he had his family
not leave for me.

34:49.000 --> 34:53.527
And we were both safely
not ready for a child. So ...

34:54.000 --> 34:55.239
Was it about me?

34:55.719 --> 35:00.089
There was no one. It was
in me, and then it was outside.

35:00.440 --> 35:03.603
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

35:04.160 --> 35:06.766
Why that makes you so cold?
You love children.

35:07.440 --> 35:09.124
Yes, by other people.

35:09.360 --> 35:12.125
Also, I did not want to
always be bound to you.

35:12.360 --> 35:16.410
So I've done things to me
hurting themselves and all around me.

35:16.720 --> 35:20.850
I hold you and leave some
am to my sister to Paris.

35:21.240 --> 35:22.925
Yes.

35:22.960 --> 35:25.645
And you came back,
because you had me missing.

35:26.400 --> 35:28.368
I'm not
therefore returned.

35:36.360 --> 35:38.408
Are you ready?

35:45.240 --> 35:46.405
I do not believe you.

35:46.440 --> 35:50.604
Why do you think I have not since then
talked to my sister?

35:52.160 --> 35:55.164
You say it all
just to get rid of me.

35:56.080 --> 35:57.844
But I still love you.

35:58.160 --> 36:02.848
I saw you at every opportunity
deceived and laughed at you.

36:03.160 --> 36:08.849
I have not even washed,
so you smell the sex and freak out.

36:10.040 --> 36:12.361
What I have done,
you hate me so much?

36:12.920 --> 36:16.606
I always thought it would be
your weakness, your selfishness ...

36:17.040 --> 36:21.011
And ... your passive-aggressive kind
But it's the little things.

36:21.360 --> 36:24.011
The way you're out of your shirt
zuknöpfst top down.

36:24.280 --> 36:27.329
The way you
chew your food.

36:27.640 --> 36:29.529
The nature,
as you fuck me.

36:29.920 --> 36:32.127
Like I was a
fragile porcelain doll

36:32.560 --> 36:34.801
that you put back on the shelf,
when you're done.

36:35.640 --> 36:40.521
You and your gentle
Orgasm tender as a whisper.

36:41.160 --> 36:44.403
I want a screaming
fucked.

36:45.360 --> 36:48.045
Your penis and my vagina
never liked each other.

36:48.480 --> 36:50.721
Have you ever noticed?

36:51.320 --> 36:55.882
In five years, I'm not even
come, and that has never heard you.

36:56.320 --> 36:57.890
Can I ask you something?

36:58.360 --> 37:01.330
- What?
- Are you pregnant?

37:01.560 --> 37:04.882
You think I'm leaving you, because I
get someone else's baby?

37:05.040 --> 37:08.886
- That would be a reason.
- Not for me.

37:09.760 --> 37:13.048
You are cruel and
injured people.

37:13.480 --> 37:19.249
This new guy I'm almost sorry. White
he, with what kind of woman he's sleeping?

37:19.284 --> 37:21.811
He will find out soon enough.

37:22.480 --> 37:24.767
If we had then clarified everything?

37:25.200 --> 37:29.171
Let us now separate ways
before we get even more hurt?

37:29.720 --> 37:32.883
Do you think you could have me
hurt more than you've done it?

37:33.320 --> 37:34.890
I do not know.

37:35.840 --> 37:38.286
I want to find out either.

37:40.360 --> 37:42.328
I'm sorry.

37:54.480 --> 37:57.165
Where would you go?
To him?

37:57.480 --> 38:00.051
You can give me those questions
no longer provide.

38:00.680 --> 38:02.921
Will I be this mysterious
Man know?

38:03.120 --> 38:04.645
I do not know.

38:06.960 --> 38:10.362
I wanted to tell you not,
but now it does not matter anymore.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.970
I think a biopsy last week
and the results are not clear.

38:14.005 --> 38:16.850
- B could be cancer.
- Stop it, it does not work this time.

38:17.040 --> 38:20.123
The major medical emergency?

38:30.280 --> 38:33.363
Why does George
on your phone to?

38:33.960 --> 38:36.930
Hi, George. It's me.
what's up! '

38:38.400 --> 38:42.086
She is here. Yes, come up.
They would be sure to see you.

38:42.600 --> 38:44.682
But give her a minute,
they must still attract.

38:45.160 --> 38:46.491
For you.

38:50.480 --> 38:53.927
Hi, no, all good
I'm going now.

38:55.080 --> 38:56.844
No, please no.

40:30.800 --> 40:32.450
Oh my God!

40:33.200 --> 40:34.929
George did this to you!

40:35.320 --> 40:37.368
You did not leave me,
and he is on? IPPT!

40:37.680 --> 40:39.569
No, honey, he's not.

40:51.520 --> 40:53.363
I'm going now.

40:53.920 --> 40:58.084
Let's see how you love me
back this time fetch.

41:00.480 --> 41:03.563
No, I meant 5 not so!
I'm so sorry!

41:04.360 --> 41:08.251
Please, do not leave me!
Please come back!

41:12.400 --> 41:16.564
Damn it!
I curse you!

41:25.320 --> 41:28.881
Do not worry, darling.
You will not be alone.

41:29.920 --> 41:32.810
Because I'll go with you.

41:37.400 --> 41:40.210
Son of a bitch!

41:49.080 --> 41:50.570
I ...

41:51.400 --> 41:52.970
I love you.

41:55.080 --> 41:56.969
I love you.

41:58.880 --> 42:00.689
I love you.

42:03.040 --> 42:04.849
I love you.

42:08.400 --> 42:10.209
I love you.

42:12.320 --> 42:13.287
I love ...

42:19.320 --> 42:23.769
Maybe I'm wrong.

42:25.800 --> 42:28.371
Am I wrong.

42:33.200 --> 42:36.409
Pause. And more.

42:38.440 --> 42:41.284
What's your story?

43:09.200 --> 43:11.043
WET DREAMS

45:12.080 --> 45:13.889
What's going on?

45:23.720 --> 45:25.484
Baby. I'm so sorry.

45:26.800 --> 45:28.484
Are you okay?

45:33.320 --> 45:35.402
Did you go?

45:37.440 --> 45:40.205
The remote control
damn remote?

45:41.160 --> 45:42.207
No ..

45:42.640 --> 45:45.211
Could you help the
Stealers play tonight.

45:45.760 --> 45:47.410
Then look at the Stealers.

45:48.040 --> 45:50.008
But I need the remote control.

45:50.680 --> 45:53.160
The last time I had me a
Program on lifestyle look.

45:53.520 --> 45:57.081
Valerie Botanelli over
Cancer or some shit.

45:57.280 --> 46:00.405
- You're going out?
- Had I told you.

46:00.440 --> 46:05.241
I have this thing with Percy. The
Christmas bonus depends.

46:10.360 --> 46:12.886
I come to early
Home promised.

46:13.840 --> 46:16.320
You promise a lot.

46:16.840 --> 46:20.242
Jesus Christ, come on,
I slept.

46:20.277 --> 46:23.210
Take some makeup.

46:23.440 --> 46:25.488
You will not even notice.

46:26.440 --> 46:31.321
My mother will notice the fifth
She is coming tomorrow for dinner.

46:31.680 --> 46:34.684
- What do I tell her?
- Tell her ...

46:35.200 --> 46:38.602
- You have to do, they should next
Weeks to come. - Yes, next week.

46:39.120 --> 46:40.804
Why not.

46:48.240 --> 46:50.322
Breakfast is ready.

47:02.960 --> 47:06.043
And this is repeated night after night.

47:06.640 --> 47:09.450
You and your wife served
your cock for breakfast?

47:09.485 --> 47:11.727
Not very Freudian.

47:15.040 --> 47:16.963
Do you meet up with a new one?

47:17.720 --> 47:21.202
Meet with a new one?
You mean, if I fuck a new one?

47:21.237 --> 47:24.443
Yeah, I mean,
fuck you new one.

47:25.360 --> 47:26.885
Not at the moment.

47:27.560 --> 47:31.770
What's with the wife of your
Dreams? With the loving vagina

47:31.805 --> 47:34.684
Is it someone who
you know?

47:36.160 --> 47:37.605
No ..

47:39.640 --> 47:42.120
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

47:43.360 --> 47:46.728
I gotta a very
ask sensitive questions.

47:46.960 --> 47:49.850
When did you last
Time someone raped?

47:52.560 --> 47:56.406
I rape always' my
Mother. Of course in my dreams.

47:56.760 --> 48:00.890
I did even people.
I kill people I love.

48:04.040 --> 48:07.522
I should do, what you
to charge for these sessions.

48:09.040 --> 48:12.010
The point is, dreams can
how can be a liberation.

48:12.640 --> 48:15.246
As a safety valve.

48:15.760 --> 48:21.563
They allow us to do things we
could not do in real life.

48:24.880 --> 48:27.690
Sometimes it is the only
Truth that we have.

48:28.880 --> 48:31.531
It is the reality of the soul.

48:32.880 --> 48:36.441
Real life is the distraction.

48:38.440 --> 48:42.286
I will not explain,
I just want it to stop.

48:43.240 --> 48:46.005
Have you tried
to open your eyes?

48:46.840 --> 48:50.367
I'm serious. The moment when
which you realize that you're dreaming ...

48:50.402 --> 48:54.331
You can use your mind ...
try to stop it.

48:56.360 --> 48:57.805
Okay ..

48:59.360 --> 49:03.524
- And how do I do that? - Full
simple. Close your eyes and count.

49:04.200 --> 49:08.171
That's what you get back, right?
Three, two, one ...

49:08.480 --> 49:10.323
wake up.

49:31.680 --> 49:33.728
Over here! Hey!

49:54.200 --> 49:55.361
Carla?

49:55.720 --> 49:57.165
Hey, you ..

49:58.080 --> 50:00.447
I have the remote control
found.

51:01.680 --> 51:03.842
Maxine! No!

51:04.880 --> 51:06.928
Carla, let them free!

51:13.280 --> 51:17.410
Maxine! Carla wait, that thing!
What the hell?

51:19.080 --> 51:20.969
Carla, stop it!

51:36.760 --> 51:40.731
Okay, you get
what you wanted.

51:41.760 --> 51:44.923
Please, let me go.

51:45.120 --> 51:46.849
No, Danny.

51:48.480 --> 51:51.086
What the hell do you want from me?

51:51.680 --> 51:53.245
The truth.

51:53.280 --> 51:56.966
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about your wife.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.765
- Let me free!
- The woman you married.

52:01.200 --> 52:06.923
Which you promised to honor her
and love until death separates you.

52:10.800 --> 52:12.768
What the shell?

52:21.880 --> 52:23.564
I dream ...

52:24.480 --> 52:26.050
It is a dream.

52:26.680 --> 52:28.170
Three ...

52:28.480 --> 52:29.925
Two ... ...

52:31.760 --> 52:32.886
. One!

54:25.080 --> 54:26.445
Wow.!

54:27.520 --> 54:30.808
You look great. You
look like a movie star.

54:32.520 --> 54:34.648
- Were you able to sleep?
- Like a baby.

54:35.200 --> 54:36.850
- Apart.
- Thank you.

54:38.520 --> 54:41.888
- What is it?
Smells delicious.

54:42.120 --> 54:45.567
That's it. when
you want, do one.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.207
No, not today.

54:49.200 --> 54:50.884
Are you okay?

54:51.520 --> 54:53.249
- Yes.
- Look.

54:54.280 --> 54:55.770
Maxine.

54:59.160 --> 55:01.640
Can not we
more hurt.

55:02.280 --> 55:05.170
- Poor baby, are you okay?
- Yes.

55:08.080 --> 55:10.970
I gave you a few
Gifts brought.

55:16.800 --> 55:21.488
Carla do not forget,
to feed it.

55:28.120 --> 55:29.804
Good morning.

55:34.880 --> 55:37.326
Breakfast time.

55:40.800 --> 55:45.124
Hold on, Tiger. I just want
to see how you're doing down there.

56:04.720 --> 56:08.008
It looks good.
Do you see?

56:11.400 --> 56:15.724
You were completely ready for
surgery last night.

56:16.480 --> 56:22.169
I thought I'd never see the day
where Donny missed the big game.

56:23.280 --> 56:28.764
I would have taken for you
But you know me ...

56:30.920 --> 56:36.290
You're the expert
with the remote control.

56:37.920 --> 56:40.571
You can not even one
Replace the bulb.

56:41.720 --> 56:44.690
Or is it your own
Women get.

56:44.960 --> 56:47.486
But when it comes to
Remotes are ...

56:47.720 --> 56:52.089
Donny ... is a black belt carrier.

56:55.760 --> 57:00.243
You want to say something?
Yes? Really?

57:01.280 --> 57:06.491
If I pick it, promise
then you tell me not to spit again?

57:08.200 --> 57:11.409
You are not as good at
Keeping promises, Danny.

57:12.320 --> 57:17.281
You will of the one-eyed monster
Mix your legs dominates.

58:03.320 --> 58:06.483
Okay, I'll bite.
what's so funny?

58:08.440 --> 58:12.809
You. You are sick,
damn witch.

58:14.840 --> 58:19.289
I'm going to start with
rip out the tits.

58:21.280 --> 58:25.763
For starters? Wow.
That is a threat.

58:26.800 --> 58:29.485
How you gonna do that?
I mean ...

58:30.640 --> 58:34.167
I am stunned.
No offense.

58:34.920 --> 58:39.482
I just have my eyes
close and count to three,

58:39.720 --> 58:43.122
and then when I wake up,
I will kill you.

58:46.520 --> 58:48.409
Do you understand me, Carla?

58:49.240 --> 58:51.686
I will kill you really.

58:59.960 --> 59:02.884
Ready or not,
here I come.

59:04.200 --> 59:05.281
Three ...

59:06.560 --> 59:07.721
Two ... ...

59:15.040 --> 59:16.166
Three, two, one!

59:16.440 --> 59:17.885
Three, two ...

59:18.360 --> 59:19.486
A.

59:20.240 --> 59:23.403
Three, two, one!

59:25.360 --> 59:29.331
You were right, that was
really a funny joke.

59:29.560 --> 59:31.403
Especially the punch line.

59:33.720 --> 59:37.611
This is my dream, bitch.

59:50.120 --> 59:53.886
You can lock us ... Stories.

59:54.640 --> 59:57.689
Even if they are our own.

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:05.403
Especially when they
are our own.

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:28.362
The power of his, own
Writing stories ...

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:32.361
... Is the power
ennoble his life.

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:39.409
Ennoble his life.

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:18.723
THE ACCIDENT

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:27.401
Why do we die, Mommy?

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:37.327
Treasures, to make room for the new
People who are born every day.

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:43.008
There is limited
Place in the world.

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:11.771
Does that mean grandmother
died ...

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:16.891
... To make room for me?

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:19.209
No ..

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.521
That does not mean entirely.

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:27.606
Grandmother died because her body
no longer worked.

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:33.884
And you've helped grandmother,
so long to stay alive.

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:39.324
How?

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:44.449
You were the reason that
she woke up in the morning.

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:49.850
So you happy they're doing.

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:53.927
Yes, I suppose, grandmother
was really very old.

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:58.891
Will I ever get old?

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:04.289
This takes a bit longer.

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:17.003
But this man was not old.

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:23.804
No, he was not.

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:28.450
Why is he dead?

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:59.444
Sometimes things just happen.

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:22.130
Maybe he has done something bad?

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:26.846
People do not die for
that they do bad things.

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:30.925
They are sent to her room,
if they were naughty.

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:34.451
Or they are in the oven, as
the wicked witch in the gingerbread house.

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:38.685
Since you're lucky that you do not
fit into our oven.

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:42.048
- Maybe I let Daddy buy one.
- No!

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.889
Oh my God.

01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:59.642
Stay in the car.

01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.851
We're on the Highway
north of ...

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:59.328
No, he is not.

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:03.930
Could be his father.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:07.642
Okay, they send someone?

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.164
Mama is the man
ever wake up?

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:16.250
No ..

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:20.886
I am not afraid.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:25.409
Perhaps as a zombie
or something?

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:32.969
Not even as a zombie. and if
but then determined to be a good zombie.

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:42.168
Why his daddy did it?

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:38.607
It's like a small
Tommy, when Old Yeller got sick.

01:08:38.642 --> 01:08:40.602
Do you remember?

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.127
Why do we die?

01:09:45.479 --> 01:09:47.926
I really do not know.

01:09:50.479 --> 01:09:54.849
What I do know is that,
while we're here ...

01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:01.922
... We should be as good as
possible care for one another.

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:09.121
If we die then ...

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:13.647
... We all die happy.

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:34.444
So happy to say
die as much as ...

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:35.442
They lived happily ...
the end of their days?

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:39.645
Yes.

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.084
Exactly.

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:48.563
It's like, they lived happily
until the end of their days.

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:28.361
Well, in order to refine his life ...

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:31.807
... You have to live it.

01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:58.168
I'm sorry.

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:02.488
It is easier to get into the story
another catch ...

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:05.406
... Live as his own.

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:37.571
Stained VISIONS

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:35.564
I love you.

01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:43.042
I only chose women
who wanted to die.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.369
And if you think about it,
I give them a voice.

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:51.121
Something they never had in life.

01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:56.361
Thanks to me, is all that they experienced
have, not just disappear.

01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:59.241
I keep her story.

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:02.288
I love them.

01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:12.160
The most important images that
People see in their lives ...

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:15.170
The key moments ...
their experiences

01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:18.967
be in a liquid
stored in their eyes.

01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:24.121
And I've discovered that these visions
transferable to other people.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.765
By a simple
surgery.

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:33.563
At the moment of her death, they see
again her life in her eyes.

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:39.568
This has become my work.
I'm her biographer.

01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:49.609
I must admit that I always
had a terrible handicap.

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:53.051
I can not dream.

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:59.924
But that does not matter anymore. Their
Dreams give me finally make sense.

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:33.441
To live here is that
Hazard of my trade.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.482
To understand it,
I need as they live.

01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:02.283
The fact that I do not
exists, is okay with me.

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:05.605
The only thing that counts,
These are the books.

01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:10.008
I'm just a formality.

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:24.681
A formality with a body.
That's my only weakness.

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:41.825
I'm just in the stories
interests of women.

01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:45.211
They are the true creators.
Those who suffer.

01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:49.603
The predictable stories
the men do not interest me.

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:52.686
No blood, no life.

01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:00.606
The strongest memories come
of women who have lived long.

01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:03.168
Anything and everything that had
have lost.

01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:04.805
Either because they had chosen
or wrong decisions.

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:10.408
These stories to
most hurt.

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:16.603
Then I feel like everything
they felt.

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:49.685
What do the unborn?
What they think or feel?

01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:03.410
Find out, could the
Key to life itself.

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:24.211
No, not my baby-making!
Let go of me!

01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:26.885
You

01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:35.890
What do you have of my baby
taken? What did you do?

01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:37.690
Damn ...

01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:01.686
My baby ...

01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:01.161
Maybe you should wake up at last.

01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:05.409
Fetus can not
see, you idiot.

01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:10.680
How do you want a vision of something on-
Write that does not even have eyes?

01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:15.322
You'll find out more,
should know as a soul.

01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:19.605
And you will regret 5,
then wanted to have.

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:23.201
Have you ever wondered where these
Voice is in your head?

01:27:23.236 --> 01:27:25.487
That voice that tells you
what to do?

01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:32.488
All the people you wrote about the
you are all recycled souls.

01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:38.210
There is nothing unique to humans.

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:41.082
Not a bit.

01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:45.605
Only creatures with
predestined life ...

01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:50.248
. The die, and then another
to live miserable scenario,

01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:54.604
created by a Creator with
a very short attention span.

01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:57.525
And it is all for his pleasure.

01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:01.131
Do you think you write the original
Stories of people?

01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:04.124
Nothing is original, you
're just a Plagiatorin.

01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:06.442
Shut up!

01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:09.320
Shut up!

01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:13.407
So I keep my mouth shut,
you have to close your eyes.

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:19.763
Listen to fool around with things
should know that no living person.

01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:23.810
Exactly.

01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:27.528
There is only one way to really
nothing more to see.

01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:32.165
TU!

01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:35.250
TU!

01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:39.044
TU!

01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:45.331
TU!

01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:47.806
TU!

01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:01.447
I suddenly see more clearly
than I have ever done.

01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:05.443
It is wonderful to be forgotten,
what I had learned.

01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:09.646
No more cravings
have to know everything.

01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:14.891
Sometimes it is better to eyes
to close and to be led.

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:22.251
I can not see, but
Finally, I can dream again.

01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:13.131
The stories are
to life. - ...

01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:19.929
even if the true
World disappears ...

01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:25.841
Until there is nothing left ...
as the storyteller.

01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:39.442
A storyteller,
whom you trust completely.

01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:10.086
SWEETS

01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:16.651
It's not you,
but me.

01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:26.050
How can such a thing
just as expressionless say?

01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:28.328
It's up to you?

01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:32.850
What about you?

01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:38.128
I need some space.

01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:40.845
Okay ...

01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:44.123
Hey, I'll give you space.

01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:46.721
Look here.
Do you see?

01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:49.568
Look.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.968
Do you see? We ...

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:55.881
We have enough space. Can
we not go?

01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:00.286
I need some time to myself.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.287
Why are you so selfish?

01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:11.041
I'm selfish!
You are selfish!

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:15.243
S me went well before you
you came into my life.

01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:34.363
It was fun. But you could
better than I get.

01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:38.363
Maybe I want no better than you.

01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:43.006
Maybe you think that you know what
Get better as I could?

01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:46.126
I'm done.
I feel terribly upset.

01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:50.445
Everyone has their problems, okay?

01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:53.486
What's on your so special?

01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:57.562
We talked about it.
Again and again and again.

01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:03.762
You know that I
meet with others, right?

01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:07.686
I did not know!

01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:14.610
But why did you
asked me for exclusivity?

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:18.768
You have exclusivity
asked, why?

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.844
You tell people not yet,
I'm your friend, right?

01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:50.971
I'll talk to anybody.

01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:52.481
I'll call anybody!

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:57.931
I want to just spend time with you,
because they mean nothing.

01:34:58.120 --> 01:34:59.929
You know.

01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:05.489
I am not currently ready for a
Relationship. I have yet gentle to me.

01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:08.566
You've begged!

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.045
I wanted to take it slow!

01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:14.045
You have my efforts
challenged!

01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:18.768
I have accepted the challenge
and see something I like very much!

01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:20.968
Just like you!

01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:56.091
I love you. But I'm
no longer in love with you.

01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:00.601
What is the difference?

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.890
Let's start again.

01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:08.285
We can get it done better.

01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:13.282
- Please, I love you!
- And I love you ...

01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:18.121
... As a friend.

01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:22.929
Friends to be something not to.

01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:25.488
Sweet, you're breaking my heart.

01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:28.811
Do not do this to us!
We are a good match!

01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:32.364
We fit together so well.

01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:35.802
We are well ...

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.604
Ball! -

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.809
Stop it.

01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:38.886
You're doing it harder,
as it should be.

01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:43.211
Why you got me all
presented to your friends?

01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:46.490
They seemed to like me.

01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:50.203
They said that the chemistry
right between us.

01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:52.609
You you want to secure.

01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:55.846
I feel only
no longer the same.

01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:00.888
Why?

01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:05.520
Do you do that with every guy like that?

01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:08.002
No, with you it was different.

01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:12.603
But one morning I woke up
and something had changed.

01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:14.804
I can not help my feelings.

01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:17.522
This has happened before,
I'm sorry.

01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:20.087
Nothing is ever
time passes ...

01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:29.331
I feel in
so special.

01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:17.246
S not you get!

01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:20.487
You have to remove from me.

01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:26.089
I do not want, please.

01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:28.530
Please ...

01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:31.084
Please.

01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:35.210
I love you.
Really, I love you.

01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:38.611
Thought for a moment
I, you were different.

01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:43.884
Please.

01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:48.246
But you're just another
pathetic, little lamb.

01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:53.250
Please, give me another chance.

01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:04.810
Fine.

01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:07.282
See you later.

01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:13.722
I miss you!
I miss you so much!

01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:17.527
I know that you do.

01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:09.731
Baby, good evening.

01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:13.927
- How are you 5?
- Terrible.

01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:16.444
Do not feel bad.

01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:22.161
I admire this woman. You
is one of my best friends.

01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:31.891
Michelle Evidenci, and you are?

01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:35.166
- We already know.
- Are we?

01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:37.209
We have already
seen a few times.

01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:41.121
Antonia is a friend.
A good friend.

01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:43.530
Well ...

01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:46.405
Is pure.

01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:48.890
Have fun.

01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:10.003
I want to stop eating.
That's my goal.

01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:15.085
At least for a few weeks,
to prove to myself that I can.

01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:17.847
You have to do everything in moderation.

01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:22.130
Unfortunately, I am not so
well is to live in moderation.

01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:25.882
I can not help it,
I just love to swallow.

01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:30.451
I wanted anyway
a break.

01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:34.966
- Soon, I have ever
made, that's okay. - Me too.

01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:36.441
Soon.

01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:38.170
We could do together.

01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:41.081
- That would be a better person
make of me. - Right.

01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:44.363
We were both
better people.

01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:48.527
What about our friends.
You would not understand.

01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:51.125
Friends come and go.

01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:55.130
If they do not appreciate,
what I do for me, then fuck it.

01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:57.203
They can be replaced.

01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:02.247
But let tomorrow
worried about it.

01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:05.649
Yes, fuck it.
It tastes too good.

01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:13.649
- I do not eat appetizers.
- One of my best friends.

01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:36.321
Until I get what I
wants, it's just me.

01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:39.245
- How it should be.
- I agree.

01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:44.320
I am my own person. And who
does not see this, you must read the book ...

01:43:44.355 --> 01:43:45.845
... About me.

01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:51.683
It's not that I do not care all.
But no one is as interesting as I ...

01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:54.561
me.

01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:57.770
It's about me or
nothing. Just me.

01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:00.163
Me, me, me ...

01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:02.289
Me, me, me ...

01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:09.284
Shit!

01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:54.570
God!

01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:00.770
God!

01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:04.329
No, no!

01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:10.844
Why?

01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:13.601
Please ...

01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:16.367
I love you!

01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:22.364
I'm sorry.

01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:25.168
I am ruined.

01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:12.364
At the end ...

01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:19.762
... Whatever the case, happened
always one of two things.

01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:23.368
It always happens.

01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:27.683
The storyteller
continues or ...

01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:31.091
. Your story.

01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:34.802
Past ... ...

01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:38.081
... Before you notice anything.
