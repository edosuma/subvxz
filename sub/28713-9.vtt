WEBVTT

00:08.967 --> 00:12.711
Well, it was different.
I, uh, was on the run, Al.

00:13.472 --> 00:14.633
From what?

00:15.807 --> 00:17.327
- What were you on the run...
- People.

00:19.353 --> 00:20.353
It was people.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.645
See, somebody helped me.

00:25.359 --> 00:26.725
That's what this is all about.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074

00:36.370 --> 00:38.453
And the thing I did was cleanup.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.539
Cleanup?

00:40.249 --> 00:43.663
You know, like, killing them.
It was what I decided I could do.

00:44.419 --> 00:46.285
That was my job, what I was good at.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.873
I took a step back.

00:52.094 --> 00:54.006
And figured out what I needed to...

00:55.472 --> 00:56.588
keep going...

00:57.641 --> 00:58.848
to keep helping.

01:00.269 --> 01:02.135
You were there, Al. You saw me.

01:02.646 --> 01:05.354
That's the place where I was gonna
spend the rest of my days,

01:05.899 --> 01:07.891
alone, with that cat.

01:09.152 --> 01:11.018
This is better, much better.

01:11.822 --> 01:16.317
It's like, every morning,
I just count up my regrets and...

01:17.911 --> 01:21.700
hang them over the shoulders
and start the day.

01:22.291 --> 01:24.408
What do you do
with the time that you have left?

01:25.377 --> 01:26.458
That's the question.

01:30.132 --> 01:33.000
The universe has tested us
in no uncertain terms.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.880
There's a utility to that.

01:35.220 --> 01:37.257
One becomes formed into something else.

01:38.515 --> 01:39.515
A survivor.

01:40.559 --> 01:42.642
There's power in that.

01:44.438 --> 01:47.602
Money, it doesn't mean anything now.

01:49.026 --> 01:52.815
I think about those people
sitting on piles of it.

01:53.780 --> 01:57.649
I don't know.
Eating caviar out of ladles, something.

01:57.743 --> 01:59.530
They could've done something
for the world.

01:59.995 --> 02:01.327
But they missed their chance.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.573
Us? This group?

02:05.584 --> 02:09.043
We're lousy with skills.
That's what being rich today is.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.212
And we sure as hell
gonna spread the wealth.

02:12.883 --> 02:16.467
I had some caviar once. I didn't...
I thought it tasted like bait.

02:18.013 --> 02:20.130
I get that people don't trust us.

02:21.308 --> 02:23.721
I didn't trust her when she reached out.

02:25.228 --> 02:26.309
Now I'm reaching out.

02:27.564 --> 02:30.682
Things change.
And if we can make that spread...

02:34.529 --> 02:35.529
that's everything.

02:37.908 --> 02:40.651
I got a chance here
to do exactly what I need to do,

02:41.411 --> 02:42.492
so I'm taking it.

02:42.579 --> 02:46.664
Every time we saw each other as people
and helped each other...

02:48.085 --> 02:49.085
things got better.

02:49.461 --> 02:50.577
We're good at this.

02:52.964 --> 02:55.547
It's like everything else
was training for this.

02:56.968 --> 03:00.132
When we got that plane
back in the air, when we landed it,

03:00.222 --> 03:02.179
when we did the impossible...

03:04.935 --> 03:06.221
some people noticed.

03:07.979 --> 03:09.186
At least a few.

03:09.272 --> 03:10.604
But that's all we needed.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.266
<i>Was that your plane?</i>

03:13.652 --> 03:16.395
<i>I heard your message.
Found one of those boxes.</i>

03:17.280 --> 03:18.691
<i>Can you really help me?</i>

03:20.867 --> 03:22.529
We haven't stopped since.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.457
So you're helping people.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.047
What about the other thing?

03:36.133 --> 03:37.214
The other thing?

03:37.968 --> 03:39.928
- Maybe...
- What's the... What's the other thing?

03:40.262 --> 03:42.379
You said it was time
we all started living.

03:46.101 --> 03:47.101
Yeah.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.896
Well, that... that is, uh,
something we're still working on.

03:52.357 --> 03:53.357
Why is that?

03:56.027 --> 03:57.268
Because, um...

03:58.864 --> 04:02.949
I guess sometimes it's easier to see
what other people need help with.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.454
- Got it?
- Mm-hmm.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.500
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.179
Let's get back to it.

04:47.162 --> 04:48.494
After what happened...

04:49.581 --> 04:53.040
I wanted to make sure
I wasn't the only one doing this, so...

04:55.670 --> 04:57.036
Sorry.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.463
I'm... I'm not used to being on this side
of the camera.

04:59.549 --> 05:02.337
It's been a while, a long while. Like...

05:03.595 --> 05:06.508
back when there was a bar to go to
at the end of the day.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.221
Um. We raided a Big Stop,

05:10.811 --> 05:13.394
we took every camera battery
and tape we could find.

05:13.772 --> 05:15.388
I know how important this story is.

05:16.358 --> 05:17.974
And I couldn't be everywhere at once.

05:29.538 --> 05:31.495
<i>After we made contact with a few people,</i>

05:31.581 --> 05:33.447
<i>we knew that there were more out there.</i>

05:34.000 --> 05:36.993
<i>So we picked up more trucks
so we could cover more ground.</i>

05:38.296 --> 05:41.164
This is C&L One.
Anything going on out there this morning?

05:42.384 --> 05:44.376
<i>All quiet on the southwestern front.</i>

05:45.095 --> 05:47.212
<i>We're en route to tank town, Mo-Mo.</i>

05:47.305 --> 05:48.716
<i>Hit you if we get any pings.</i>

05:49.391 --> 05:50.472
Got it.

05:56.815 --> 05:59.148
This here is how
we keep the convoy humming.

05:59.526 --> 06:03.145
Polar Bear's dudes hooked us up with it
when we got to the oil fields.

06:03.613 --> 06:06.151
We go fill her up
every couple weeks or so.

06:06.700 --> 06:10.444
Logan was right about one thing.
Gas is starting to go kaput.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.369
It was hard enough trying to get places.

06:17.502 --> 06:20.336
We drive the MRAP
behind the tanker to keep it safe.

06:21.047 --> 06:22.163
Right, Skidmark?

06:24.009 --> 06:25.969
There's still people out there
who want to get it.

06:26.386 --> 06:29.379
And we'd like to think
our presence discourages them.

06:29.472 --> 06:30.472
See...

06:31.933 --> 06:33.515
Logan thought we were stupid.

06:33.602 --> 06:36.470
He thought we'd fall for that
Good Samaritan schtick

06:36.563 --> 06:38.054
a second time, but...

06:39.316 --> 06:41.103
he just wanted the gas for himself.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.559
And the dick squad.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.442
But we got him good.

06:47.782 --> 06:49.239
Hey! Hey!

06:49.868 --> 06:51.655
What are you doing? Where you going?

06:53.788 --> 06:54.788
Stop!

07:00.837 --> 07:02.624
Karma's a bitch, Logie.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.583
I mean, technically,

07:06.676 --> 07:09.840
what we did to him isn't that different
than what we did to Clayton, but...

07:11.806 --> 07:12.922
this felt good.

07:14.851 --> 07:15.851
It did.

07:19.356 --> 07:24.317
I got lucky. Fell in with the, uh,
right folks this time.

07:24.945 --> 07:28.404
Now I'm basically doing the polar opposite
of what I used to do, and...

07:28.990 --> 07:30.990
and if I keep doing that
for the rest of my life...

07:31.993 --> 07:35.953
well, uh, it won't make up
for everything that I did, but...

07:36.748 --> 07:38.865
I'll know I did some good.

07:40.001 --> 07:43.745
And being on the road, you know,
I can find her.

07:45.966 --> 07:46.966
Maybe.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.714
He won't let me give him a haircut.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.718
Doesn't matter what I look like.

07:59.771 --> 08:00.771
It does.

08:02.565 --> 08:03.601
Daniel.

08:05.652 --> 08:06.652
Look at me, man.

08:06.736 --> 08:10.070
It wouldn't take much
to make you look very presentable.

08:10.657 --> 08:11.738
Let's move on out.

08:20.291 --> 08:23.580
I'm in the Sprinter
with Strand and Luciana,

08:23.670 --> 08:25.630
which means we're the lead vehicle
when we go out.

08:26.047 --> 08:29.085
It used to be because I was,
like, the first line of defence,

08:29.175 --> 08:31.792
but now I'm helping map out
which roads are still clear.

09:08.214 --> 09:09.455
I think the change is good.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.218
It's what I needed.

09:31.696 --> 09:33.153
Tell me about Alicia.

09:33.239 --> 09:36.323
She's my friend.
I wasn't with her when she needed me,

09:36.409 --> 09:39.322
but I'm with her now,
and I'm doing what she can't.

09:54.719 --> 09:58.178
Grace and I, you could say
we're in charge of the caravan.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.381
We left the river mill
'cause everyone we found

10:00.475 --> 10:02.558
who's needed our help is so far apart,

10:02.644 --> 10:04.764
it just didn't make sense
to operate out of one place.

10:05.688 --> 10:08.977
We try to keep everyone comfortable
when we're taking them back and forth

10:09.067 --> 10:10.979
between the outposts
we set up along the road.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.080
Rice noodles.

10:26.709 --> 10:27.709
Oil.

10:28.711 --> 10:29.918
Garlic powder.

10:30.922 --> 10:32.316
We're running low on powdered eggs.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.340
Growlers!

10:36.928 --> 10:38.385
Everyone in the truck!

10:41.141 --> 10:42.803
We'll find a place to call home.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.602
Eventually.
But it's got to be the right place.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.018
When's the wedding?

10:52.902 --> 10:55.064
I think we've got
more important things to do.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.280
As far as I'm concerned,
we're already married.

10:59.951 --> 11:02.193
She has my word, and she has my heart.

11:03.454 --> 11:04.974
That's all that matters in this world.

11:25.393 --> 11:27.134
Sorry. What was that you were doing?

11:27.228 --> 11:29.766
Earlier, you had your fingers around
your neck like you were...

11:31.065 --> 11:32.681
Like you were checking your lymph nodes.

11:36.362 --> 11:38.524
I wake up every morning...

11:40.074 --> 11:41.110
wondering if...

11:42.243 --> 11:45.987
today will be the day
I start to feel sick.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.999
It used to stop me
from doing a lot of things.

11:51.794 --> 11:56.664
But now I'm trying to do
as much as I can while I can.

11:59.010 --> 12:00.251
What are you listening to?

12:01.012 --> 12:04.676
Oh, um, it's an audiobook.

12:05.808 --> 12:08.016
I listen to it at double speed
when we're on the road.

12:09.103 --> 12:10.139
It's good.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.692
Back when we were on that plane,
I never pictured this.

12:17.403 --> 12:18.735
Us coming this far.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.948
But I do feel good about what we're doing.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.951
Seeing what it's doing for everybody.

12:27.789 --> 12:30.702
What about you?
What do you think it's done for you?

12:32.043 --> 12:34.410
Now, if you'd asked me that
before we met Tess,

12:34.921 --> 12:36.787
I might not have had an answer for you.

12:37.423 --> 12:38.630
But you do now?

12:45.890 --> 12:49.759
<i>Morgan, do you copy?
We could use some help.</i>

12:50.395 --> 12:54.355
Luciana? Yeah, we copy.
Just tell us where we're going.

13:04.993 --> 13:06.985
She was trying to reach her husband
on the walkie.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.245
- What's her name?
- It's Tess.

13:11.249 --> 13:14.492
<i>He hasn't come back.
I don't know why it's taking so long.</i>

13:16.379 --> 13:18.120
Why don't you come out and talk to us?

13:18.214 --> 13:19.921
<i>I can't. I just...</i>

13:20.425 --> 13:23.463
<i>I don't know where they are.
Ben rigged the field.</i>

13:24.053 --> 13:25.089
"They"?

13:26.139 --> 13:27.471
You don't know where what are?

13:37.317 --> 13:39.855
Landmines. It was landmines.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.655
Look out.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.240
How many more mines
you got buried out there?

13:47.744 --> 13:48.951
<i>I don't know.</i>

13:49.037 --> 13:51.154
<i>He wanted to make sure
no one could get close.</i>

13:51.497 --> 13:52.908
That's gonna bring a lot more.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.286
We got to fix that fence.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.051
<i>But there's a roadblock
Up on the cloverleaf</i>

14:10.141 --> 14:12.178
<i>And them bears was wall-to-wall</i>

14:12.268 --> 14:14.601
<i>Yeah, them smokies
Is thick as bugs on a bumper</i>

14:14.687 --> 14:16.349
<i>They even had a bear in the air</i>

14:16.439 --> 14:17.930
<i>I says, Callin' all trucks</i>

14:18.024 --> 14:19.024
<i>This here's the Duck</i>

14:19.108 --> 14:20.565
<i>We's about to go a-huntin' bear</i>

14:20.651 --> 14:22.768
<i>Come on and join our convoy</i>

14:22.862 --> 14:24.702
<i>- Ain't nothin' gonna get in our way</i>
- Unh-unh.

14:24.739 --> 14:28.733
<i>We gonna roll this truckin' convoy
'Cross the USA</i>

14:28.826 --> 14:32.365
<i>Ooh, convoy</i>

14:33.706 --> 14:37.199
Sarah and Wendell
really like their trucker music.

14:37.543 --> 14:38.875
It's, um...

14:39.712 --> 14:41.203
It's all they listen to.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.960
This is not music.

14:45.802 --> 14:49.546
Oh, that ain't just music.
That's our anthem.

14:50.306 --> 14:53.140
That's how we stay in touch
when I'm out on the road

14:53.226 --> 14:56.094
and Wendell's back watching the kids
at tank town.

14:57.480 --> 15:00.894
Chuckles,
tank town is a need-to-know kinda spot,

15:00.983 --> 15:03.600
and nobody else needs to know, you know?

15:04.946 --> 15:05.946
Cut the cam.

15:07.156 --> 15:12.368
They should've shut Logan's mouth
as soon as he opened it. No more words.

15:13.454 --> 15:15.696
He'd proven the worth of his words.

15:18.543 --> 15:20.205
<i>Can you keep them from coming?</i>

15:20.545 --> 15:21.545
Yeah, we're trying.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.583
<i>If they get too close to the house,
there are...</i>

15:25.425 --> 15:27.712
<i>Ben, he... he put them everywhere.</i>

15:28.094 --> 15:30.256
- Gotta keep them away from that fence.
- Yeah.

15:31.681 --> 15:32.681
Tess?

15:33.766 --> 15:35.098
Tess, talk to me.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.016
<i>I... I don't know what to say.</i>

15:38.938 --> 15:40.145
Where did your husband go?

15:41.649 --> 15:44.266
<i>He went to the drug store
to find an inhaler.</i>

15:44.610 --> 15:46.647
<i>My son, he has asthma.</i>

15:47.780 --> 15:50.739
But he's all right?
His breathing, it's okay?

15:51.075 --> 15:53.613
<i>Yes. No.</i>

15:54.162 --> 15:55.528
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

15:56.914 --> 16:00.533
All right. Look, we're gonna
send some people to look for him.

16:01.210 --> 16:04.999
In the meantime, why don't you come out?
Come out and see what we look like.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.459
<i>Are those cameras?</i>

16:10.845 --> 16:12.489
Yeah, maybe we should
turn them off for now.

16:12.513 --> 16:14.049
No, it's important.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.761
Yes. We are, uh...

16:17.977 --> 16:21.436
We're recording so that we can show people
what we're about.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.727
Not a lot of people saw what we did.

16:25.860 --> 16:26.860
With the plane.

16:27.737 --> 16:30.150
Figure this is the best way
to get the message out.

16:30.698 --> 16:34.658
Still figuring out a way
to actually get people to watch it.

16:35.077 --> 16:36.568
So they know we're not full of crap.

16:37.079 --> 16:39.287
<i>No, I can't leave.</i>

16:39.582 --> 16:40.698
All right.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.585
- June, Alicia, we need your help with...
- Tess?

16:44.670 --> 16:47.333
...a run for our new friend here
and an ammo re-up for me, pronto.

16:47.757 --> 16:51.091
Come on, Tess.
Tell me why you can't leave.

16:52.470 --> 16:56.760
<i>I... I haven't left the house
since everything went bad.</i>

16:57.934 --> 17:02.975
<i>We have supplies, a septic system,
and we even have a garden inside.</i>

17:03.648 --> 17:06.356
Would've been helpful if he'd made
a map of where those things are.

17:08.027 --> 17:11.316
You know, it took me a long time to leave
the first place I was holed up in.

17:14.157 --> 17:15.239
Why is that?

17:16.786 --> 17:17.786
Just did.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.452
<i>You all don't need to put yourselves out.</i>

17:22.875 --> 17:24.411
<i>Ben will be back soon.</i>

17:24.710 --> 17:27.919
I'm sure he will.
But we're gonna stay here all the same.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.878
Make sure your boy gets what he needs.

17:39.433 --> 17:41.049
Told you we were gonna draw a crowd.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.309
You think they're gonna find him?

17:44.480 --> 17:48.474
Uh... We got on a plane,
crashed it, rebuilt it.

17:49.777 --> 17:52.190
Somehow,
finding someone's husband out here

17:52.738 --> 17:53.819
seems like it's harder.

17:54.907 --> 17:55.943
You found June.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.890
Maybe we ought to save the questions
till we're free and clear.

18:00.997 --> 18:03.785
I guess this day hit us all
pretty close to home,

18:04.208 --> 18:05.449
each in our own particular way.

18:35.072 --> 18:38.691
There's no inhaler, Morgan.
He must've already been here.

18:42.288 --> 18:45.497
He walked here to get it.
Which means he walked home.

18:52.548 --> 18:55.837
Tess needed to leave that house,
and she couldn't.

19:00.222 --> 19:02.930
That's what can happen
when you settle in one place too long.

19:05.353 --> 19:06.434
Things go bad.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.303
We decided to split up.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.310
Thought we could
cover more ground that way.

19:25.456 --> 19:27.823
Nothing this way.
You guys seeing anything?

19:28.668 --> 19:30.330
<i>Nada. Alicia?</i>

19:39.804 --> 19:41.887
My mom used to look for
the little bit of good

19:41.972 --> 19:43.554
every time she went out into the world.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.020
She would've liked this.

19:59.615 --> 20:03.279
I haven't killed since after the plane.

20:04.412 --> 20:05.653
Just seeing that tree, I...

20:07.707 --> 20:09.494
I just...

20:12.461 --> 20:13.793
I didn't want to go back there.

20:21.804 --> 20:22.885
John.

20:22.972 --> 20:25.555
- All right. I'll cover you.
- Okay.

20:30.771 --> 20:32.433
I knew this was loaded for Morgan.

20:32.982 --> 20:35.850
That woman and her son, and what he lost?

20:37.528 --> 20:38.814
Does he talk about it?

20:39.572 --> 20:40.572
No.

20:42.700 --> 20:45.113
When I was a cop, you'd go whole shifts

20:45.202 --> 20:48.202
without saying more to your partner than
"Good morning" and "Who's driving?"

20:48.539 --> 20:50.121
Still, you knew what made 'em tick.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.790
He got my back, I got his.

20:53.461 --> 20:55.578
You couldn't ask
for a better partner on a run.

20:57.465 --> 20:59.331
You're not gonna show this to June,
are you?

20:59.425 --> 21:00.961
John's not a big talker.

21:03.596 --> 21:04.882
At least not always.

21:08.684 --> 21:09.684
Neither am I.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.019
At least not always.

21:18.486 --> 21:21.479
- You want to put that down for a minute?
- I've rolled during worse.

21:31.540 --> 21:32.540
Back up, back up!

21:38.839 --> 21:40.171
Tell me about the minefield.

21:40.257 --> 21:43.671
Well, I've called a lot of things
"ugly mustard,"

21:43.761 --> 21:46.595
but this was by far
the ugliest mustard I've ever seen.

21:47.014 --> 21:48.014
What?

21:49.225 --> 21:50.716
Where did that phrase come from?

21:50.810 --> 21:53.268
Uh, it's something my grandpa used to say.

21:54.271 --> 21:55.807
He worked in a delicatessen.

21:56.690 --> 21:57.690
If you hesitate...

21:58.818 --> 21:59.818
you don't get the story.

22:00.236 --> 22:03.149
It was intense.

22:04.698 --> 22:05.698
Yeah.

22:09.286 --> 22:10.652
We got to hit 'em before they...

22:21.507 --> 22:22.507
You okay?

22:29.390 --> 22:31.131
Trust me, words cannot describe it.

22:49.743 --> 22:51.109
You two all right in there?

22:52.162 --> 22:54.404
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

22:56.292 --> 22:58.705
Guys, where are we with the inhaler?

22:59.169 --> 23:02.503
The tree wasn't the only remarkable thing
we found out in those woods.

23:02.798 --> 23:06.917
That walker that came at Alicia
wasn't just any walker.

23:22.818 --> 23:23.818
It was him.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.269
It was Tess' husband.

23:31.076 --> 23:32.908
- That's all we have.
- Right.

23:34.330 --> 23:35.411
Morgan?

23:39.501 --> 23:40.501
Mommy?

23:41.879 --> 23:42.879
Mommy!

23:43.255 --> 23:45.747
We don't know how close
those mines are to the house.

23:46.842 --> 23:49.255
It could hurt the people inside, the boy.

23:51.555 --> 23:53.592
Morgan. Morgan!

23:56.310 --> 23:57.551
It was loaded for me.

24:00.356 --> 24:02.564
I knew it from the moment
I first talked to her.

24:02.983 --> 24:05.942
Because of what happened
to your wife and son?

24:12.660 --> 24:13.696
Yes.

24:16.413 --> 24:18.496
Morgan, stay in the craters!

24:23.170 --> 24:24.331
Don't move!

24:24.421 --> 24:25.957
- We're clear!
- Don't move!

24:26.840 --> 24:27.840
Your left foot.

24:29.510 --> 24:30.626
Shit.

24:35.015 --> 24:36.756
- Morgan?
- John.

24:38.143 --> 24:39.350
Don't come any closer.

24:43.983 --> 24:46.066
Yeah, we're not gonna listen to you
on that one.

24:46.610 --> 24:48.476
I don't want anybody else to get hurt.

24:49.697 --> 24:50.904
Well, neither do we.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.703
Looks like
this could take a while, though.

24:59.289 --> 25:00.905
Might as well have some company.

25:01.458 --> 25:02.458
Huh?

25:12.845 --> 25:14.962
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Easy. Easy.

25:15.723 --> 25:16.723
We have the inhaler.

25:17.307 --> 25:18.388
Just take it easy.

25:18.684 --> 25:21.084
We don't know how many more
of these things there are around.

25:21.311 --> 25:22.847
<i>What's going on out there?</i>

25:28.027 --> 25:29.438
Tess, we found the inhaler.

25:31.071 --> 25:33.233
But we're gonna need you
to come out here and get it.

25:34.158 --> 25:38.198
<i>No. No. Ben, he'll be back. He can get it.</i>

25:38.746 --> 25:40.157
<i>He can help you too.</i>

25:44.043 --> 25:45.784
I didn't want to tell you like this.

25:49.131 --> 25:50.838
Ben's not coming back, Tess.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.340
<i>No. No. He... He will.</i>

25:56.430 --> 25:57.430
We found him.

25:58.807 --> 26:00.719
He had the medicine that your boy needed.

26:01.810 --> 26:03.176
He got what you needed.

26:06.106 --> 26:07.222
Can you come out here?

26:11.236 --> 26:12.236
<i>No.</i>

26:13.864 --> 26:17.323
<i>Whoever you found, that wasn't him.</i>

26:18.619 --> 26:19.780
<i>He's coming back.</i>

26:23.749 --> 26:26.036
She just couldn't bring herself
to say goodbye.

26:26.376 --> 26:28.618
I get it. It's hard.

26:34.093 --> 26:35.093
Morgan.

26:41.767 --> 26:42.883
Morgan, I...

26:48.690 --> 26:51.023
She's not coming out,
so we're doing this now.

26:52.903 --> 26:54.815
Got to get that inhaler inside.

26:54.905 --> 26:57.864
- I'm putting the camera down.
- No. They need to see this.

27:00.702 --> 27:02.568
So you dealt with one of these before, Al.

27:03.038 --> 27:05.405
Did an imbed in an EOD unit overseas.

27:05.499 --> 27:08.242
That you're not already a goner
might mean it's a dud.

27:08.794 --> 27:11.628
Or it's a pressure-release device.
We can't know.

27:11.713 --> 27:12.749
Okay.

27:14.883 --> 27:15.919
You should get back.

27:16.009 --> 27:18.797
No. We can do this.
I'll talk you through it.

27:19.638 --> 27:23.006
First, you just need to dig out around it
so we can see what we're up against.

27:23.100 --> 27:25.057
- Dig out?
- Yeah, gently.

27:27.354 --> 27:28.390
Morgan.

27:29.773 --> 27:31.685
A smaller blade, that'd be more precise.

27:32.985 --> 27:33.985
Thank you.

27:35.988 --> 27:38.480
- Could you?
- Yeah. Got it.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.158
Thank you.

27:55.257 --> 27:56.257
Okay.

27:59.386 --> 28:00.386
Here.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.022
- Which one?
- Uh, this one.

28:13.108 --> 28:16.067
- Here?
- Should access the fuse, yeah.

28:19.323 --> 28:20.323
Wait.

28:21.241 --> 28:23.324
Wait. That... That could trigger
the firing pin.

28:23.952 --> 28:26.410
Uh, yeah. It's... It's this one.

28:27.331 --> 28:28.913
How sure are you about this?

28:34.922 --> 28:36.458
- Fifty-fifty.
- Fift...

28:40.177 --> 28:41.177
Okay.

28:43.555 --> 28:44.555
Okay.

28:48.185 --> 28:50.097
I had something planned for tonight.

28:52.105 --> 28:53.437
Something I think we all need.

28:53.523 --> 28:55.283
No, don't go making
any final pronouncements.

28:55.359 --> 28:56.520
I'm not, John. I'm not.

28:58.862 --> 29:00.774
Just saying we're still gonna do it,
all right?

29:01.448 --> 29:02.529
Okay.

29:04.076 --> 29:05.157
So, on three.

29:14.836 --> 29:15.917
One...

29:17.756 --> 29:18.756
two...

29:20.259 --> 29:22.876
<i>Wait. What are you doing?</i>

29:25.138 --> 29:26.629
Pulling the firing pin.

29:27.266 --> 29:28.507
<i>That won't work.</i>

29:29.476 --> 29:31.889
<i>I saw Ben do this a hundred times before.</i>

29:34.273 --> 29:36.356
- No, stay back.
- I can help.

29:43.156 --> 29:45.569
I want to help.

29:51.623 --> 29:52.659
I know...

29:53.834 --> 29:55.200
he's not coming back.

30:23.363 --> 30:24.479
He used these.

30:26.283 --> 30:27.283
Thank you.

30:29.703 --> 30:31.490
Right, as soon as the holes line up,

30:32.122 --> 30:33.488
you're gonna slide the pin in.

30:34.499 --> 30:39.369
Just lift your foot very, very slowly
to release the pressure.

30:50.057 --> 30:52.424
Okay. I think that's in.

30:52.517 --> 30:53.849
Think it'll hold?

30:53.935 --> 30:55.927
I don't know. Think you should back up.

30:57.564 --> 30:59.271
Think everybody should back up.

31:00.275 --> 31:01.275
Careful.

31:18.168 --> 31:19.168
Come on.

31:30.847 --> 31:32.930
Oh. Move.

31:38.730 --> 31:39.730
Let's go.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.489
She hadn't stepped outside the house
in two years.

31:50.575 --> 31:51.782
But she did today.

31:51.868 --> 31:53.609
To help Morgan.

31:53.703 --> 31:56.787
All because we were there to help her.

31:58.041 --> 31:59.157
Oh, my God.

31:59.584 --> 32:01.166
- Morgan.
- How do you feel?

32:01.420 --> 32:02.420
How do I feel...

32:02.629 --> 32:03.665
Whoa!

32:15.642 --> 32:17.349
I didn't think she would come out.

32:18.228 --> 32:19.309
Why not?

32:36.538 --> 32:38.780
<i>You can hear that somebody's gone.</i>

32:38.874 --> 32:40.410
<i>You can see it for yourself.</i>

32:40.917 --> 32:42.874
<i>And even then, you still can't believe it.</i>

32:45.755 --> 32:47.041
Sometimes it...

32:52.220 --> 32:54.257
Sometimes you just can't say goodbye.

33:10.739 --> 33:12.605
We've been wanting to do it for a while.

33:13.575 --> 33:14.816
Finally, we could.

33:15.368 --> 33:18.406
Psst. Grace. Tell me about the pad Thai.

33:20.582 --> 33:22.995
I had this recipe on my fridge
for years, and...

33:23.502 --> 33:25.619
this is what it took for me
to finally make it.

33:26.671 --> 33:29.584
I managed to find all the ingredients
in some form or another.

33:30.342 --> 33:35.303
Worcestershire as fish sauce,
and ketchup packets are damn versatile.

33:37.182 --> 33:38.548
It's just missing the peanuts.

33:43.813 --> 33:45.896
He didn't think that everyone was bad.

33:47.067 --> 33:48.148
He just thought...

33:49.277 --> 33:50.643
that we should stay put.

33:52.322 --> 33:53.904
Try to survive where we were.

33:56.243 --> 33:57.779
That help would come someday.

34:03.083 --> 34:04.119
He was right.

34:06.419 --> 34:07.500
Thank you.

34:12.132 --> 34:13.293
There's a proud tradition

34:13.385 --> 34:15.842
of eating noodles around a campfire
with this crew.

34:17.597 --> 34:18.597
Come on.

34:24.688 --> 34:26.725
You want to get some practice in tomorrow?

34:28.024 --> 34:29.024
It's been a while.

34:32.445 --> 34:34.812
Actually, I'm kind of working
on something of my own.

34:37.074 --> 34:38.074
Okay.

34:41.246 --> 34:42.246
Hey.

34:45.667 --> 34:47.408
I want to know who's painting those trees.

34:53.632 --> 34:54.632
I want to find them.

35:42.807 --> 35:44.139
Missing spice or you want spice?

35:59.366 --> 36:01.574
You never know
where help is gonna come from.

36:02.118 --> 36:04.235
But we all need it at one time or another.

36:04.621 --> 36:07.204
Talking about Tess? Talking about you?

36:08.124 --> 36:12.289
You said you didn't think you could
answer my question before you met Tess.

36:12.379 --> 36:13.586
What did you mean by that?

36:13.963 --> 36:15.704
I knew I needed help with something.

36:19.594 --> 36:21.085
But I didn't know what it was.

36:21.930 --> 36:22.966
And now you do?

36:27.185 --> 36:29.302
It's been a long time since I lost them.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.401
I still haven't said goodbye.

36:45.245 --> 36:46.736
I think I need to, Al.

36:49.499 --> 36:50.956
But I just don't know how.

36:55.547 --> 36:56.547
I don't.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.136
I need help.

37:10.979 --> 37:12.686
Help finding my own way...

37:15.400 --> 37:16.561
to make things better.

37:17.277 --> 37:19.314
I need to figure out
how to make this world

37:19.404 --> 37:21.316
a little more like
the one we used to have.

37:23.450 --> 37:25.533
I need to find a place for all of us...

37:26.619 --> 37:28.531
that won't be like
the other places I've been.

37:29.539 --> 37:30.539
So, what now?

37:32.167 --> 37:33.999
I've got a lot more things I want to do.

37:35.378 --> 37:37.870
Making the most of my second chance.

37:42.010 --> 37:46.675
Being the man that my daughter
would've been proud to call her dad.

37:47.265 --> 37:51.430
Ending each day knowing I've tried to make
someone else's life better.

37:53.730 --> 37:57.690
Doing right by the people
who took a chance on me.

38:00.695 --> 38:03.733
Keepin' that rig chugging
for the poet of the pavement.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.649
What about you, Al?
What do you need help with?

38:11.164 --> 38:13.907
Making sure these stories
aren't just interviews on a tape.

38:32.602 --> 38:35.185
I started filming our stories
so we would have it.

38:38.691 --> 38:40.307
It became about so much more.

38:41.319 --> 38:42.901
We are out here helping...

38:43.947 --> 38:45.563
but this is bigger than any of us.

38:45.907 --> 38:47.114
And we can't do it on our own.

38:47.200 --> 38:48.566
That's why we made this tape.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.071
That's why you're watching it now.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.368
We need you.

38:51.454 --> 38:54.197
However you can with whomever you can.

38:54.290 --> 38:56.031
Because that's how this lasts.

38:56.125 --> 38:57.957
When everyone starts helping...

38:58.044 --> 38:59.910
That's how we start helping everyone.

39:00.296 --> 39:03.835
So if you're watching this,
um, pick up a walkie...

39:05.093 --> 39:06.880
leave somebody some food,

39:07.720 --> 39:10.337
do something, do anything.

39:10.431 --> 39:11.547
Help yourself.

39:11.641 --> 39:12.641
Help them.

39:12.725 --> 39:13.806
Help us.

39:13.893 --> 39:15.100
Help everyone.

41:20.937 --> 41:21.937
Shit.

41:45.420 --> 41:46.877
Look, I don't want any trouble.

41:46.963 --> 41:49.626
Yeah. Neither did I.

41:52.301 --> 41:53.667
There's something you need to see.

41:57.598 --> 42:00.807
That's what happens to your shoes
when you walk 200 miles.

42:01.352 --> 42:02.888
Imagine what happens to your feet.

42:05.314 --> 42:06.314
The dead walk.

42:07.859 --> 42:08.940
We weren't meant to.

42:10.236 --> 42:11.522
Least I'm not.

42:13.364 --> 42:14.571
Spent a lot of time...

42:16.409 --> 42:18.992
clearing these roads with Clayton.
So did my crew.

42:20.872 --> 42:23.205
And now we can't even make use
of our own handiwork...

42:27.462 --> 42:28.669
'cause you took our gas.

42:33.384 --> 42:34.384
Doris.

42:43.352 --> 42:44.352
Hey. Hey!

42:44.437 --> 42:46.178
I wouldn't do that if I were you!

43:02.538 --> 43:05.827
Why don't you just tell us
where the oil fields are, and...

43:07.085 --> 43:08.747
we can forget all this horseshit?

43:08.836 --> 43:11.169
I don't know what kind of horseshit
you're talking about.

43:12.006 --> 43:14.089
I'm ignorant of said horseshit.

43:16.385 --> 43:17.501
You're not with them?

43:17.595 --> 43:19.382
With who? The people on that tape?

43:20.181 --> 43:22.423
No. I'm not "with them."

43:24.560 --> 43:27.849
More horseshit. Different kind.

43:33.444 --> 43:34.810
You steal that from them?

43:41.661 --> 43:42.742
I like you.

43:46.290 --> 43:47.701
Make sure he can't follow us.

43:49.377 --> 43:50.413
Whoa.

43:54.340 --> 43:55.672
Aw.

43:57.885 --> 43:59.877
You got the front tyre. It's not like...

44:13.526 --> 44:14.607
Come on.

44:17.738 --> 44:19.570
Oh, God.

44:30.001 --> 44:32.618
Unless you want to join
the marching band over there...

44:34.714 --> 44:36.376
you might want to get out of here.

44:40.219 --> 44:41.219
How?

44:47.852 --> 44:48.852
Call them.

44:49.729 --> 44:50.890
When they pick you up...

44:52.899 --> 44:55.642
tell them they're making more enemies
than friends out here.

45:03.326 --> 45:05.659
And we got more bullets
than we know what to do with.
