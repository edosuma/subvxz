THAT WON'T MAKE THE TEST RESULTS
POST FASTER.

20:22.421 --> 20:24.056
IT'S LIKE
HITTING THE ELEVATOR BUTTON.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.325
THAT WORKS
4% OF THE TIME.

20:26.325 --> 20:28.227
NO, IT DOESN'T!

20:28.227 --> 20:29.695
WHY'D YOU STOP HITTING
"REFRESH"?

20:29.695 --> 20:31.097
YOU SAID
IT DOESN'T WORK.

20:31.097 --> 20:33.365
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!

20:33.365 --> 20:35.301
HEY, YOU GUYS,

20:35.301 --> 20:37.737
I CAN'T HAVE YOUR NERVOUSNESS
STRESSING ME OUT.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.339
IF I JUST HOLD MY FACE LIKE THIS
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,

20:40.339 --> 20:42.007
I'LL BE HAPPY.

20:44.677 --> 20:47.012
[ COMPUTER CHIMES ]

20:47.012 --> 20:50.149

THEY'RE, UH, THEY'RE POSTED.

20:50.149 --> 20:51.150
OHHH.

20:53.018 --> 20:55.020
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS MOMENT FOR SIX YEARS.

20:55.020 --> 20:56.522
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN LOOK.

20:56.522 --> 20:57.490
WAIT -- REALLY?

20:57.490 --> 20:59.558
AH, NO. I CAN LOOK.

21:01.560 --> 21:04.130
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.
