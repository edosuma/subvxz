00:02.333 --> 00:03.467
Previously on "The Breaks"...

00:03.533 --> 00:04.767
Yo, Chuck.
You got DeeVee's tape?

00:04.833 --> 00:06.233
Sorry, sis,
it's in my ride,

00:06.300 --> 00:09.267
but my dumbass cousin
got it stolen in Jersey.

00:10.600 --> 00:11.767
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:11.833 --> 00:13.233
you are listening to
the sounds

00:13.300 --> 00:14.533
of the one, the only...

00:14.600 --> 00:16.700
Ahm!

00:16.767 --> 00:19.933
And super producer
DJ DeeVee!

00:20.000 --> 00:21.600
So you're a middle man,
not the label.

00:21.667 --> 00:24.333
I negotiate with the label
on behalf of the artist.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.400
Thanks for your time.

00:25.467 --> 00:26.733
Name was Tina.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.100
She crossed paths with
your friend Ahmed Harris,

00:29.167 --> 00:31.733
and someone else
you might know goes by Scooby.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.733
I need you to call
your man, the hookup.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.500
You don't have anybody else
that you can call?

00:35.567 --> 00:38.767
Orson, you should really
license my Bob James masters.

00:38.833 --> 00:40.400
Okay, 600,000.

00:40.467 --> 00:41.567
Peter Piper
beat on this, right?

00:41.633 --> 00:43.333
Nah, that's Bob James,
too.

00:43.400 --> 00:44.967
Bring me an artist
worth signing and we'll talk

00:45.033 --> 00:46.900
about a future for you
here at EBJ.

00:46.967 --> 00:48.367
Like to bring you
onboard EBJ.

00:48.433 --> 00:50.500
Keep playing games
with my artists,

00:50.567 --> 00:51.767
I'ma play games
with you.

00:51.833 --> 00:52.900
You do that, Barry.

00:52.967 --> 00:54.433
I'm goin' after
Vanilla Ice.

00:54.500 --> 00:56.367
David's gone
and he's not coming back!

00:56.433 --> 00:58.067
You don't wanna deal
with that, then fine.

00:58.133 --> 00:59.600
Whoa, whoa, hey!
Wait a minute!

00:59.667 --> 01:00.933
I didn't do anything,
Dad!

01:01.067 --> 01:02.067
You need to do this

01:02.067 --> 01:03.167
so you can get
out of this hood.

01:53.100 --> 01:54.467
Yo.

01:54.533 --> 01:56.967
Niggas tried
to roll on me.

01:57.067 --> 01:58.500
Yeah.

01:58.567 --> 02:01.500
Nah, tell the boys.

02:01.567 --> 02:03.567
Meet me here.

02:19.533 --> 02:20.767
Police!
Hands up!

02:20.833 --> 02:22.367
I'm clean.
Get your hands up!

02:22.433 --> 02:24.133
Turn and face the wall.

02:24.200 --> 02:25.800
I said turn
and face the wall.

02:25.867 --> 02:27.300
Put your hands
behind your back.

02:27.367 --> 02:28.900
Your other hand.

02:31.367 --> 02:33.267
You knew I was
on you.

02:33.333 --> 02:34.400
How come you ain't move?

02:34.467 --> 02:36.200
Where I'ma go?

02:44.800 --> 02:47.100
Yeah, we got an unexpected
break in the case.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.467
I was dying to get up
to JB's before we did all this,

02:50.533 --> 02:53.467
but... you know.
First thing's first.

02:53.533 --> 02:54.700
You still go up there?

02:54.767 --> 02:58.300
Nah.
Too bad, got quite the rap.

02:58.367 --> 02:59.800
But as luck would have it,

02:59.867 --> 03:01.200
I get this call
the other day

03:01.267 --> 03:04.467
about this fucked up Saab
in Jersey.

03:04.533 --> 03:06.100
So I'm scratching
my head.

03:06.167 --> 03:08.833
I'm homicide.

03:08.900 --> 03:12.767
Fuck they callin' me about
a stolen car in Jersey, right?

03:19.733 --> 03:22.067
Then I remember
my man Chuck asked me

03:22.067 --> 03:24.667
to keep my ear out when
his ride got swiped.

03:24.733 --> 03:26.700
So I go to meet him
at the impound.

03:26.767 --> 03:27.933
I'm thinkin' he's amped

03:28.067 --> 03:30.100
'cause he's gettin'
his shit back.

03:30.167 --> 03:31.933
He's way more excited,

03:32.067 --> 03:34.267
'cause this is in
the tape deck.

03:40.967 --> 03:42.300
That's your break
in the case?

03:42.367 --> 03:45.500
Nah, we got something
way better than that.

03:45.567 --> 03:48.333
This just good music.

03:48.400 --> 03:51.333
Hey, yo, Ahm, that's that shit
I'm talkin' 'bout, man.

03:51.400 --> 03:54.433
That's that new flavor
right there, son!

03:54.500 --> 03:56.333
That's that new shit, huh?

03:56.400 --> 03:57.900
Straight into the '90s!

04:04.900 --> 04:08.567
Imani, you know what kills
most new record companies?

04:08.633 --> 04:11.133
Hits.
Without financing,

04:11.200 --> 04:13.400
a small label can't
keep up with demand.

04:13.467 --> 04:14.933
They cant afford
to press records,

04:15.067 --> 04:17.067
distributors don't
pay them back for months,

04:17.133 --> 04:18.767
the label
can't afford promoters,

04:18.833 --> 04:20.233
they can't pay
their artists.

04:20.300 --> 04:22.367
Now, when guys like Foray
realize this,

04:22.433 --> 04:23.633
you know who they turn to?

04:23.700 --> 04:26.067
Wait, but just
two seconds ago

04:26.133 --> 04:28.467
you said that Fouray was
the best place for me to go.

04:28.533 --> 04:30.300
And now
I'm saying EBJ is.

04:30.367 --> 04:31.800
You need a label
with experience,

04:31.867 --> 04:34.300
not someone that's just trying
to figure it out as they go.

04:36.267 --> 04:38.667
Shake my hand,
you'll be in the studio today.

04:43.567 --> 04:45.700
(Vanilla Ice, on TV

04:47.233 --> 04:48.867
I told you our boy
was a star.

04:48.933 --> 04:50.133
And I hear what they're
already saying about Ice,

04:50.200 --> 04:51.867
calling him
the Elvis of Rap.

04:51.933 --> 04:53.367
But trust me when I tell you,
Tommy and I both think

04:53.433 --> 04:55.600
this guy is the real deal.
And when someone like Fouray

04:55.667 --> 04:57.167
wants to put
his name behind him,

04:57.233 --> 04:59.467
everybody else is gonna think
he's the real deal too.

04:59.533 --> 05:00.967
Is 100 grand
real enough for you?

05:01.067 --> 05:02.567
'Cause we can make the deal
happen right now.

05:02.633 --> 05:04.433
You could bring him
to my showcase tonight.

05:04.500 --> 05:06.767
Atlantic is offering 250.

05:06.833 --> 05:08.067
What about credibility?

05:08.100 --> 05:09.733
I imagine we could buy
some of that.

05:12.633 --> 05:14.300
I'll match it.
Wh-- no, B--

05:14.367 --> 05:15.900
I'll match it.

05:15.967 --> 05:18.067
Like, meet me back here
in a couple of hours.

05:18.100 --> 05:19.367
I'll have the money here
for you.

05:21.633 --> 05:23.467
I'll see you
in a few.

05:23.533 --> 05:25.333
All right.

05:28.767 --> 05:30.233
Cancel the showcase.
What?

05:30.300 --> 05:32.367
Even if you had the money
to match Atlantic's offer,

05:32.433 --> 05:33.633
which you don't,
there's no way

05:33.700 --> 05:34.733
you could have him
on stage by tonight.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.300
I ain't canceling shit.

05:36.367 --> 05:38.633
Everybody wants this kid.

05:38.700 --> 05:39.867
You need to call
your man.

05:39.933 --> 05:41.500
No, no. B, we talked
about this yesterday.

05:41.567 --> 05:44.067
Yeah, yesterday, when my
father's money was enough.

05:44.100 --> 05:46.933
Now it's not.
Call him.

05:47.067 --> 05:48.367
You don't even like
Vanilla Ice!

05:48.433 --> 05:49.667
I don't have to like him.

05:49.733 --> 05:53.067
These little white girls
are going to love him!

05:53.067 --> 05:54.767
Call your guy!
Listen, B,

05:54.833 --> 05:56.100
that is not the way
we wanna go about this.

05:56.167 --> 05:57.267
You listen.

05:59.733 --> 06:01.967
Elvis, Ray.

06:04.267 --> 06:06.600
Elvis.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.333
Fine.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.200
I'll call him.

06:13.567 --> 06:16.067
I understand you are charged
with first degree murder

06:16.100 --> 06:17.667
in the killing
of Brian Lesley,

06:17.733 --> 06:20.267
also known as Geronimo.
Prosecution?

06:20.333 --> 06:22.467
Your Honor, the prosecution
will present an eye witness

06:22.533 --> 06:23.700
who will state in this court

06:23.767 --> 06:26.233
that he saw Mr. Harris
kill Mr. Lesley.

06:26.300 --> 06:28.167
Your Honor, this witness
has no credibility.

06:28.233 --> 06:29.733
I move to dismiss
on lack of evidence.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.567
Your Honor, I request
that bail be denied.

06:31.633 --> 06:34.067
This man is the head
of a continuing criminal
enterprise.

06:34.100 --> 06:35.867
I hear you, counselor.

06:35.933 --> 06:37.200
Mr. Harris...

06:37.267 --> 06:40.167
For the record,
what do you do for a living?

06:40.233 --> 06:41.500
I'm a rapper.

06:41.567 --> 06:42.900
Motion to dismiss denied.

06:42.967 --> 06:44.767
You want to bring him back
for a RICO charge,

06:44.833 --> 06:47.900
make the complaint.
Bail is set at 300,000.

06:47.967 --> 06:51.567
Next case.
Docket number 1ZA7956.

06:51.633 --> 06:53.567
Darryl van Putten Jr.,

06:53.633 --> 06:55.367
charged with obstruction
of justice.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.567
State your name
for the court.

07:02.633 --> 07:03.767
Darryl Van Putten Jr.

07:03.833 --> 07:05.867
Okay, Mr. Van Putten,
am I to understand

07:05.933 --> 07:08.367
that you are an alibi witness
to Mr. Harris?

07:09.800 --> 07:12.133
Yes, Ma'am.

07:16.667 --> 07:19.133
You dragged this kid in here
for obstruction of justice?

07:19.200 --> 07:20.767
Your Honor,
Mr. van Putten has--

07:20.833 --> 07:23.233
Has done nothing.
Get him out of here.

07:23.300 --> 07:25.733
Mr. Van Putten,
I expect to see you

07:25.800 --> 07:27.267
in this court
at trial.

07:27.333 --> 07:28.800
Next.

07:30.300 --> 07:32.800
So I don't even know why
I'm doing this thing any more.

07:32.867 --> 07:35.533
My wife hates me
for it.

07:35.600 --> 07:39.067
It's not like suing for Ray
is gonna bring him back.

07:39.100 --> 07:42.067
So drop it.
Move on.

07:42.100 --> 07:43.333
Listen,
if there's anything

07:43.400 --> 07:45.100
I can do for you, just ask.
Anything.

07:45.167 --> 07:46.667
For starters,
I'd like to square away

07:46.733 --> 07:48.167
this Bob James deal
with you.

07:49.333 --> 07:51.400
Bob James deal?
Our greatest hits CD.

07:51.467 --> 07:54.467
I got the early stuff,
remember?

07:54.533 --> 07:56.533
You were gonna buy
my masters for 600 grand.

07:56.600 --> 07:57.967
I didn't say that.

07:58.067 --> 08:01.167
Bob James, he's great, but...
who cares?

08:01.233 --> 08:02.967
Orson,
at the poker game.

08:03.067 --> 08:04.067
You looked me
right in the eye,

08:04.100 --> 08:05.233
you said we had
a deal.

08:05.300 --> 08:08.200
That?
I was fucking with you.

08:08.267 --> 08:10.900
Juggy, come on,
Bob James?

08:10.967 --> 08:12.833
Listen, you've been
through a lot.

08:12.900 --> 08:14.600
It's time to
just let it go.

08:14.667 --> 08:15.933
Let it all go.

08:16.067 --> 08:19.500
Move on.
You've done your time.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.100
I gotta go.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.933
Whose song is this?
Who's singing it?

08:46.833 --> 08:48.200
Why isn't she just
singing the hook?

08:48.267 --> 08:49.433
Why's she singing
the whole song?

08:49.500 --> 08:51.333
'Cause it's her song.
Teddy Riley wrote it

08:51.400 --> 08:52.867
for Jody Watley, but now
Imani gets to do it.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.800
But she's not a singer,
she's a rapper.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.100
A rapper writes
their own stuff.

08:56.167 --> 08:58.567
Imani doesn't need
to be in a box.

09:00.833 --> 09:03.333
Boy, what the hell,
you... what?

09:04.900 --> 09:07.133
Ella, would you like a minute
to consult with your client?

09:10.067 --> 09:11.233
Nikki, a word.

09:17.633 --> 09:19.400
You can't be serious.
Of course I'm serious.

09:19.467 --> 09:20.600
Have you heard
the girl's voice?

09:20.667 --> 09:21.867
She came here to rap.

09:21.933 --> 09:23.700
We'll roll her out
as a rap artist...

09:23.767 --> 09:25.867
Nobody will take her seriously
if you do that.
...in her second album.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.267
You only have one chance
to break an artist.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.600
You don't need to explain
that to me, Nikki.

09:29.667 --> 09:31.867
Now I appreciate that you're
protective, that's good.

09:31.933 --> 09:33.567
Any A&R worth a damn is.

09:33.633 --> 09:35.267
But you have to
trust me on this.

09:35.333 --> 09:36.967
She has too much talent
to waste

09:37.067 --> 09:38.367
on what could be
a very short-lived career

09:38.433 --> 09:40.133
as a female MC.
Don't you agree?

09:40.200 --> 09:42.533
I mean, I--
I'm not saying
that she won't rap,

09:42.600 --> 09:44.067
just not yet.

09:44.100 --> 09:46.567
And it's better that EBJ
makes its first push into rap

09:46.633 --> 09:47.967
with an artist that has
a better chance

09:48.067 --> 09:49.333
of doing it
for the long haul,

09:49.400 --> 09:52.600
like the rapper
you played for me earlier.

09:52.667 --> 09:55.067
Ahm.
Uh, you heard his song
on the radio.

09:55.100 --> 09:56.767
Everybody heard his song
on the radio.

09:56.833 --> 09:57.900
Can you get to him?

09:57.967 --> 09:59.233
Yeah.

09:59.300 --> 10:01.567
I promise I won't
make him sing.

10:15.267 --> 10:16.567
It's Maisha, yo.

10:16.633 --> 10:18.733
Bruce and them shot up
her crib last night.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.433
What?

10:20.500 --> 10:21.800
She a'ight?
She a'ight.

10:21.867 --> 10:23.367
Fuck, man.

10:23.433 --> 10:25.433
We should go knock their heads
off right now, nah mean?

10:25.500 --> 10:27.000
Teach these niggas
a lesson.

10:27.067 --> 10:30.367
Nah. Call Bruce.
Set up a meeting.

10:30.433 --> 10:31.833
The fuck you talking about?
A meeting?

10:31.900 --> 10:33.167
Yeah, nigga, a meeting.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.133
We're gonna end
this shit today, man.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.100
Where Maisha?
She at your crib.

10:37.167 --> 10:38.533
Teddy watching the door.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.367
You for real, nigga?
A meeting?

10:40.433 --> 10:42.067
You a'ight? You good?

10:42.133 --> 10:44.133
No, I am not.

10:45.067 --> 10:46.367
Where's CJ?
Mama house.

10:46.433 --> 10:47.633
She was watching him,
thank God.

10:47.700 --> 10:49.467
Now will you tell them
to let me go?

10:49.533 --> 10:50.867
Scooby all whack ass,
gonna lock me in here

10:50.933 --> 10:52.733
like I'm some fucking prisoner.
Maisha, relax.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.800
You're better off here,
for your own protection.

10:54.867 --> 10:55.967
Protection?
Yeah.

10:56.033 --> 10:57.333
Ain't no protection here.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.267
Ain't no protection
nowhere in this game.

10:59.333 --> 11:01.533
Ain't you figured that
out by now?

11:02.867 --> 11:04.633
Look, I appreciate what
you're trying to do,

11:04.700 --> 11:07.067
but as long as you out here
in these streets,

11:07.067 --> 11:09.200
you ain't no safer
than Smoke.

11:16.167 --> 11:17.800
She good.

11:34.233 --> 11:35.333
Couldn't find you
at your place.

11:35.400 --> 11:37.233
I figured
I'd try you here.

11:45.567 --> 11:48.300
I watch it now,
here.

11:49.700 --> 11:52.733
I feel like he's still here,
I guess; I don't know.

11:55.600 --> 11:58.800
To see what
he loved so much.

11:58.867 --> 12:00.367
It's pretty good.

12:07.067 --> 12:08.633
Let me play you
something.

12:30.233 --> 12:32.300
Me and Ray go way back.

12:33.467 --> 12:35.833
So I'm not anticipating
any bullshit.

12:40.067 --> 12:42.333
Yo...

12:42.400 --> 12:44.067
Well, uh-- we good.

12:44.133 --> 12:46.867
So I can let my folks know
you cool with the terms?

12:46.933 --> 12:48.300
Absolutely.
Yeah.

12:48.367 --> 12:50.300
I mean, we're sitting on
a goldmine here.

12:50.367 --> 12:51.667
And you know what?

12:51.733 --> 12:53.100
I'ma get this money
back straight to you.

12:53.167 --> 12:54.367
Trust me.

12:56.700 --> 13:00.967
We do, Mr. Fouray.
We most certainly do.

13:10.633 --> 13:12.200
You hear that internal rhyme?

13:12.267 --> 13:14.200
The alliteration,
the metaphor?

13:14.267 --> 13:15.700
No.

13:15.767 --> 13:17.267
Look, you didn't come
all the way out here

13:17.333 --> 13:18.967
to teach an old dog
new tricks.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.167
I brought Mattie Taylor
an artist.

13:22.233 --> 13:24.467
She offered me a job.

13:24.533 --> 13:25.967
Mazel tov.

13:26.067 --> 13:27.300
Yeah, well, she doesn't know
a thing about hip hop

13:27.367 --> 13:28.533
and she's already
fucking it up.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.867
Now she wants me
to bring her Ahm.

13:30.933 --> 13:33.900
The MC that was working
with DeeVee.

13:33.967 --> 13:36.067
Anyway...

13:36.100 --> 13:38.467
I think I made
a big mistake.

13:38.533 --> 13:40.800
And I'm running
out of bridges to burn.

13:40.867 --> 13:42.167
That's funny.

13:42.233 --> 13:43.933
Lately I've been thinking
the same thing about myself.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.400
Well, what do you think
I should do?

13:51.333 --> 13:52.833
Juggy?

13:58.500 --> 14:00.833
God damn...

14:14.133 --> 14:16.067
Who is it?

14:16.067 --> 14:17.733
DeeVee.

14:25.300 --> 14:27.667
Why you knock like that?

14:27.733 --> 14:29.400
Uh, I thought that was
the only way

14:29.467 --> 14:32.200
you answered
the door.

14:32.267 --> 14:34.133
We need to talk.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.733
Thought you wasn't fucking
with me no more.

14:45.233 --> 14:46.400
I'm not.

14:46.467 --> 14:49.533
So?
What do we gotta talk about?

14:54.467 --> 14:56.233
I'm thinkin' about
leaving town.

14:56.300 --> 14:57.767
Don't want you
to do that.

14:57.833 --> 15:01.967
I don't wanna do that.
That's the thing.

15:05.667 --> 15:06.967
If I don't leave,

15:07.067 --> 15:09.200
do I gotta keep
looking over my shoulder?

15:10.467 --> 15:12.467
It's New York City,
man.

15:12.533 --> 15:14.367
You always gotta look
over your shoulder.

15:14.433 --> 15:16.800
You know what I mean.
No, I don't.

15:19.900 --> 15:21.233
If I stay,

15:21.300 --> 15:23.600
and I don't sign
the affidavit...

15:25.433 --> 15:27.433
do I have anything
to worry about?

15:30.100 --> 15:32.633
What you think?

15:32.700 --> 15:36.933
I don't know.
You tell me.

15:42.067 --> 15:44.633
I guess you want
your equipment back.

15:52.367 --> 15:54.067
Yeah.

16:22.400 --> 16:23.567
All right, people!

16:23.633 --> 16:25.833
It's six hours
and counting, okay?

16:25.900 --> 16:27.633
Have we heard
from Ernesto yet?

16:27.700 --> 16:29.667
For the umpteenth time,
not yet.

16:29.733 --> 16:31.233
And why are you yellin'?

16:31.300 --> 16:33.867
Because this is the biggest
night of my career,

16:33.933 --> 16:36.633
and it's game time, baby.

16:36.700 --> 16:38.633
Yo, what's this I hear
about you

16:38.700 --> 16:40.167
trying to get Imani
on Music Box?

16:40.233 --> 16:41.533
Yeah, that's right.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.233
And I want to be reimbursed
for all my out of pocket.

16:43.300 --> 16:45.100
Oh, so you haven't heard?

16:45.167 --> 16:47.333
Oh, she's over
at EBJ now.

16:47.400 --> 16:49.533
Yeah, with Mattie Taylor,
and Nikki took her there.

16:49.600 --> 16:50.833
What?!
Oh, yeah.

16:50.900 --> 16:52.067
So you need to call
Ralph right now,

16:52.133 --> 16:53.633
and no, you can't
play the video.

16:53.700 --> 16:56.133
Wait, but I--
No wait, no but,
no none of that.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.700
You either with me
or against me, Josie.

16:57.767 --> 16:58.700
What's the deal?

16:58.767 --> 17:00.233
I-- All right.
Thank you.

17:00.300 --> 17:01.800
Yo, so I just got word

17:01.867 --> 17:03.567
Vanilla Ice has 12 dancers
for tonight.

17:03.633 --> 17:04.700
But the stage I ordered
from Cirque

17:04.767 --> 17:05.733
can only hold four,
max.

17:05.800 --> 17:07.067
Then you need a bigger stage.

17:07.100 --> 17:08.733
A bigger stage
is double the money, B.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.067
Double the profit.

17:10.067 --> 17:11.300
Double the money,
double the profit.

17:11.367 --> 17:13.133
That sound good to me.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.667
Yo, what is that
I'm hearing right now?

17:15.733 --> 17:17.500
Yo, my man! What's that
you listening to?

17:17.567 --> 17:18.600
Who is that?

17:18.667 --> 17:20.433
Oh, it's that cat Ahm.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.600
My boy, he taped it
off the radio last night.

17:22.667 --> 17:24.100
The shit's dope.
Oh, shit.

17:24.167 --> 17:26.867
Ahm, yeah?
Is he signed?

17:27.767 --> 17:29.300
Oh, uh, I--
I don't know.

17:29.367 --> 17:30.800
You know, Nikki was the one
who had the line on this guy.

17:30.867 --> 17:32.833
Yeah, fuck Nikki.
She don't have shit.

17:32.900 --> 17:34.500
She don't have
a line on nothin'.

17:34.567 --> 17:35.600
Fucking Judas.

17:35.667 --> 17:38.067
Barry.
It's Ernesto.

17:38.133 --> 17:39.533
Oh, shit,
it's Ernesto, Ernesto.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.433
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:41.500 --> 17:42.700
Gimme that.

17:42.767 --> 17:44.733
Yo, what's up, playboy?

17:44.800 --> 17:46.233
Yeah, shit,
I got what you need.

17:46.300 --> 17:48.667
What you mean?
Y'all ready for tonight?

17:51.400 --> 17:53.067
Man, what?

17:54.867 --> 17:56.600
Ah, nah, nah.
A'ight, man, I understand.

17:56.667 --> 17:59.200
It's business.
Yeah.

17:59.267 --> 18:02.067
Nah, nah, nah.
That's okay, man.

18:02.100 --> 18:04.167
Good luck
to y'all, man.

18:05.967 --> 18:07.400
Damn.
What?

18:07.467 --> 18:10.333
Vanilla Ice just signed
over at SBK.

18:10.400 --> 18:13.400
325,000.
Shit.

18:13.467 --> 18:14.567
I know.

18:14.633 --> 18:18.300
So...
what happens now?

18:18.367 --> 18:20.967
Now...

18:21.067 --> 18:23.433
Now we go get Ahm.

18:31.967 --> 18:34.467
Good afternoon,
Nikki Jones.

18:34.533 --> 18:37.400
Lovely seeing you again.

18:37.467 --> 18:39.933
Thank you.

18:44.700 --> 18:46.733
Expecting trouble?

18:46.800 --> 18:49.067
Nah.
What's up?

18:49.100 --> 18:51.533
Everybody's talking about
that song you did with DeeVee.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.633
I heard something
about that.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.233
We wanna get you
in the studio.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.867
I'm working with
Mattie Taylor over at--

18:56.933 --> 18:58.167
You not with Fouray
no more?

18:58.233 --> 19:00.667
No, I'm at EBJ.

19:00.733 --> 19:01.900
They're new to rap,
but--

19:01.967 --> 19:03.300
Pardon me, but...

19:03.367 --> 19:05.767
Why I wanna fuck with somebody
that's brand-new to rap?

19:05.833 --> 19:08.600
If I do this shit,
I want it done right.

19:08.667 --> 19:10.467
Then EBJ is the place
for you.

19:10.533 --> 19:12.767
Mattie Taylor's been
creating stars for years.

19:12.833 --> 19:13.967
You won't find somebody

19:14.067 --> 19:15.167
who'll take
better care of you.

19:15.233 --> 19:15.967
Yeah, what else?

19:16.067 --> 19:18.667
What else you want?

19:18.733 --> 19:20.467
I want DeeVee
as part of my deal.

19:20.533 --> 19:22.467
No problem.

19:24.633 --> 19:27.067
A'ight.

19:27.067 --> 19:30.267
Y'all do that...
we can talk.

19:34.167 --> 19:36.100
All right.
Cool.

19:36.167 --> 19:37.100
A'ight.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.467
Oh, sorry, sorry.

19:57.600 --> 19:58.833
Ahh.

19:58.900 --> 20:02.267
Yo, a'ight.

20:02.333 --> 20:03.867
Young buck.

20:03.933 --> 20:06.933
I know you know who Ahm is.
I do.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.233
What guarantee do you have
that this dude's

20:14.300 --> 20:15.967
not gonna
come back on you?

20:17.700 --> 20:19.500
I don't.

20:19.567 --> 20:22.267
I just can't keep running
the rest of my life, Pop.

20:22.333 --> 20:23.867
I mean, you didn't.

20:23.933 --> 20:25.333
The fuck are you
talkin' about?

20:25.400 --> 20:28.567
Why you think I got the hell
out of Fort Greene? Hmm?

20:33.400 --> 20:35.300
We're not finished.

20:38.233 --> 20:40.433
Maybe you can talk some sense
into the boy.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.733
I guess you felt like
wasting your money.

20:49.800 --> 20:51.967
What's the problem,
DeeVee?

20:52.033 --> 20:53.867
You act like
I did something to you.

20:53.933 --> 20:55.800
What do you want?

20:55.867 --> 20:57.233
I want my friend back.

20:57.300 --> 20:59.033
That's why I've been
calling you.

20:59.100 --> 21:01.467
Really?
'Cause it seems like

21:01.533 --> 21:03.967
there's only one thing
that you care about...

21:04.067 --> 21:06.433
and it ain't
your friends.

21:06.500 --> 21:09.200
How could you say
something like that to me?

21:09.267 --> 21:11.133
How many times have I
looked out for you?

21:11.200 --> 21:12.767
I was the one
who helped you hang up

21:12.833 --> 21:14.200
all those little
chicken shit flyers

21:14.267 --> 21:16.600
when you first started
spinning back at G-Dubb.

21:16.667 --> 21:17.933
That was a long time
ago, Nikki.

21:18.067 --> 21:20.067
So that's it?

21:20.133 --> 21:21.500
You just gonna
walk away

21:21.567 --> 21:22.967
from four years of friendship
just like that?

21:23.067 --> 21:25.800
That's how you walked away
from David, right?

21:25.867 --> 21:27.933
Jesus Christ, DeeVee.

21:29.467 --> 21:31.967
So now you're blaming me
for David's death.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.133
You think I knew
he was gonna die?

21:35.200 --> 21:37.067
You don't think
I regret every day

21:37.067 --> 21:39.067
breaking up with him?

21:40.533 --> 21:42.067
Fuck you.

21:42.067 --> 21:43.933
Fuck you, and fuck
your friendship.

21:44.067 --> 21:45.267
Nikki, wait.

21:48.667 --> 21:50.067
What?

21:57.267 --> 21:58.900
Look, I--
I'm sorry, okay?

21:58.967 --> 22:03.700
I just...
I'm sorry.

22:03.767 --> 22:05.667
Do you know how much
that hurts me?

22:05.733 --> 22:09.233
Yes, I do.
And I'm sorry.

22:15.767 --> 22:17.167
Look, you wanna
go inside?

22:17.233 --> 22:19.433
I think Dad got some
Nutter Butters hidden somewhere.

22:22.967 --> 22:24.967
I'm okay.

22:41.833 --> 22:45.367
I think I got you
a deal.

22:45.433 --> 22:46.933
What?

22:47.067 --> 22:49.967
You and Ahm,
signed as a single act.

22:50.067 --> 22:51.433
A-are you kidding?

22:51.500 --> 22:53.733
Mattie Taylor heard
your song on the radio.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.067
She wants to sign you.
No.

22:55.133 --> 22:56.100
Everybody wants
to sign you.
No, no.

22:56.167 --> 22:57.433
I'm not signing with Ahm.

22:57.500 --> 23:00.067
What? Why? I thought
that was your boy.

23:00.067 --> 23:01.567
Yeah, but my boy
might have killed someone.

23:01.633 --> 23:02.600
But he might not have!

23:02.667 --> 23:03.600
Okay, well, great.

23:03.667 --> 23:05.067
Then, if he doesn't
go to jail,

23:05.067 --> 23:07.067
after I testify that
I wasn't recording with him

23:07.100 --> 23:08.700
that entire night,
then I'll sign.

23:08.767 --> 23:10.367
Okay, so you're willing
to just walk away

23:10.433 --> 23:12.367
from everything you have
ever dreamed about

23:12.433 --> 23:15.733
because of something that
might be a trumped up charge?

23:15.800 --> 23:17.100
Did Ahm put you
up to this?

23:17.167 --> 23:19.767
What?
Ahm.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.067
Did he put you
up to this?

23:21.067 --> 23:22.100
So what if he did?

23:22.167 --> 23:23.100
Nikki, he's just trying
to get me

23:23.167 --> 23:24.733
to shore up
his alibi.

23:24.800 --> 23:26.533
So?
So?

23:26.600 --> 23:27.733
Are you kidding me?

23:27.800 --> 23:28.933
You come in here,
heartbroken

23:29.067 --> 23:30.533
that we're not
friends anymore--

23:30.600 --> 23:32.233
"Oh, boo-hoo David"--

23:32.300 --> 23:35.200
and it's just business!

23:35.267 --> 23:36.933
It's always
just fucking business!

23:37.067 --> 23:38.333
It is not just business,
DeeVee.

23:38.400 --> 23:39.733
Do you know how many
people would give

23:39.800 --> 23:42.133
their left nut for an
opportunity like this;

23:42.200 --> 23:45.133
how many people spend their
entire miserable lives

23:45.200 --> 23:47.100
wishing for a chance
at greatness;

23:47.167 --> 23:49.400
a chance to say something
that's gonna be heard;

23:49.467 --> 23:51.800
something that's worth
hearing?

23:51.867 --> 23:55.067
That's not business.
That's your fucking dream.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.367
And I for one
am willing to do

23:56.433 --> 23:58.233
whatever I need to
to make that happen.

23:58.300 --> 24:00.233
Yeah, like get in bed
with a murderer.

24:00.300 --> 24:01.867
You knew he wasn't no Gandhi
when you met him, DeeVee.

24:01.933 --> 24:04.567
Come on, you don't get a scar
like that from eatin' pussy.

24:06.133 --> 24:08.633
I don't know what he did
or what he didn't do.

24:08.700 --> 24:12.167
All I know is,
he's been through a lot.

24:12.233 --> 24:14.067
And I think he's trying
to change.

24:16.267 --> 24:19.067
So you can judge him...

24:19.133 --> 24:20.700
or you can help him.

24:37.167 --> 24:38.833
Last time we talked,

24:38.900 --> 24:40.067
you told me to come
back to you

24:40.100 --> 24:42.133
when I got my label.
I got my label now.

24:42.200 --> 24:43.300
Good for you.

24:43.367 --> 24:45.633
And I-I wanna
put you out.

24:45.700 --> 24:47.067
Period.

24:47.067 --> 24:49.400
No fly shit.
None of that.

24:49.467 --> 24:51.133
I'm serious.

24:51.200 --> 24:53.233
So let's say
I fuck with you.

24:53.300 --> 24:55.867
How would that shit
work out?

24:55.933 --> 24:57.167
I'm gonna be straight up
with you.

24:57.233 --> 24:59.167
Please.
I got the money
to do it.

24:59.233 --> 25:00.367
I had the money

25:00.433 --> 25:01.700
when I talked to you
the first time.

25:01.767 --> 25:03.367
I just needed distribution
to come around

25:03.433 --> 25:05.200
so I could
put your shit out.

25:05.267 --> 25:07.767
Uh-huh.
Now that lane is clear.

25:09.300 --> 25:10.833
Got a showcase tonight
for the distributors,

25:10.900 --> 25:12.433
so they can see where
their money is going.

25:12.500 --> 25:15.533
I want them to see you,
on the stage, live,

25:15.600 --> 25:17.333
mic in hand, you know
what I'm sayin',

25:17.400 --> 25:19.767
doin' what
you do best.

25:19.833 --> 25:22.700
Then what?
You kill it...

25:22.767 --> 25:24.133
you sign with me,

25:24.200 --> 25:27.133
and you ain't livin'
like this no more.

25:27.200 --> 25:29.467
So what
you wanna do?

25:41.367 --> 25:43.067
Yo.

25:46.300 --> 25:48.067
I'm not doin'
this bullshit!

25:48.133 --> 25:49.267
Oh, no?

25:49.333 --> 25:50.367
Who you cussin' at,
little girl?

25:50.433 --> 25:52.433
My manager!
Imani, listen,

25:52.500 --> 25:53.800
all you have to do

25:53.867 --> 25:56.167
is do the run
one more time.

25:56.233 --> 25:57.533
You're this close.

25:57.600 --> 25:59.367
Close to what?

25:59.433 --> 26:01.500
I don't want
no Teddy Riley song!

26:01.567 --> 26:03.067
I look like Guy to you?

26:03.067 --> 26:05.167
Actually...

26:05.233 --> 26:08.633
And you-- you said this one was
supposed to be a dope moment.

26:08.700 --> 26:10.933
I ain't no fucking singer!

26:11.067 --> 26:12.267
You hear my voice?

26:12.333 --> 26:15.067
I spit!
I rhyme!

26:15.100 --> 26:16.800
Yo, I'm out!

26:21.467 --> 26:24.067
Don't worry.
I'll handle this.

26:27.067 --> 26:30.067
The genius in artists
is often also their demon.

26:30.133 --> 26:31.667
She's right, you know.

26:31.733 --> 26:35.167
I don't like
repeated conversations.

26:35.233 --> 26:37.067
Didn't I ask you
to do something?

26:37.133 --> 26:39.233
Done.

26:39.300 --> 26:41.067
Ahm will sign
with EBJ.

26:45.300 --> 26:47.300
That's great.
That's good.

26:47.367 --> 26:48.400
That's great.

26:48.467 --> 26:50.467
One catch.

26:52.733 --> 26:54.700
He wants to sign
with his producer, DeeVee,

26:54.767 --> 26:56.133
as a duo.
No.

26:56.200 --> 26:57.633
Ahm gets a deal,

26:57.700 --> 26:59.667
producer gets a straight fee
like everyone else.

26:59.733 --> 27:01.233
If it wasn't for DeeVee
nobody would know who Ahm is.

27:01.300 --> 27:03.867
Signing two people means
twice the accommodation,

27:03.933 --> 27:05.667
twice the insurance handlers.

27:05.733 --> 27:08.100
No.
It's his one condition.

27:08.167 --> 27:10.700
Jesus Christ, fuck.

27:12.067 --> 27:13.500
Fine, tell him fine.

27:13.567 --> 27:15.733
I'll have the kid
sign the paperwork

27:15.800 --> 27:16.967
for the songs
that he produces.

27:17.067 --> 27:19.100
He'll never know
the difference.

27:19.167 --> 27:21.967
Congratulations, Nikki.

28:03.667 --> 28:06.067
Barry, I'm sorry.

28:06.100 --> 28:08.733
Give me a minute.

28:08.800 --> 28:10.700
Nice outfit.

28:12.467 --> 28:13.700
Who the fuck
do you think you is,
coming into my office--

28:13.767 --> 28:15.567
My office.
Get the -- out.

28:15.633 --> 28:17.367
I want the office.
Are you on crack?

28:17.433 --> 28:19.067
What are you talkin' about?

28:19.067 --> 28:20.600
You have an artist showcase
starting in a couple of hours,

28:20.667 --> 28:22.167
and you don't have any artists.

28:22.233 --> 28:24.533
But I on the other hand,
have the hottest act in town.

28:24.600 --> 28:26.400
No you don't.
I got Ahm and DeeVee.

28:26.467 --> 28:28.567
So if you want to sign them
to Fouray records,

28:28.633 --> 28:30.067
you will make me
Vice President,

28:30.067 --> 28:32.667
I will get this office, and...

28:36.267 --> 28:37.367
My salary.

28:37.433 --> 28:39.767
Uh-uh, $75,000 is
completely unreasonable.

28:39.833 --> 28:41.900
I know.
You can leave.

28:41.967 --> 28:44.100
So you would have your showcase
tank just to spite me.

28:44.167 --> 28:46.600
Ahm didn't say anything
about talking to you today.

28:46.667 --> 28:49.600
You talked to Ahm?
Of course.

28:49.667 --> 28:51.200
How else am I
supposed to sign him?

28:51.267 --> 28:52.633
What'd he say?

28:52.700 --> 28:54.967
Well, why don't you wait for him
to get here and find out?

28:55.067 --> 28:57.333
He's on his way here?
Yep. To sign.

28:57.400 --> 28:58.967
He won't sign without DeeVee.

28:59.067 --> 29:00.700
Oh, I'm definitely gonna--
I'm signing DeeVee, too.

29:00.767 --> 29:01.933
I'm definitely gonna
sign DeeVee.

29:02.067 --> 29:03.100
Well, DeeVee's my best friend

29:03.167 --> 29:04.533
and he won't sign
without my blessing.

29:05.900 --> 29:07.400
Well, we gonna
find out about that.

29:07.467 --> 29:09.067
Hey, Tamika.

29:09.100 --> 29:10.800
Yeah.

29:10.867 --> 29:12.367
Give me Happy, please.

29:17.067 --> 29:20.733
VP, this office,
60,000.

29:24.100 --> 29:29.500
Half of that,
no office...

29:29.567 --> 29:31.133
and you can have VP.

29:33.567 --> 29:35.333
Deal.

29:36.433 --> 29:38.200
Not bad, Ms. Jones.

29:41.700 --> 29:43.400
It's okay.

29:48.967 --> 29:50.733
Is he really
on his way down here?

29:50.800 --> 29:53.067
Why don't you call him
and find out?

30:04.067 --> 30:06.267
Date there.

30:43.333 --> 30:45.300
How them coins?

30:45.367 --> 30:47.600
Dangerous.
Yours?

30:47.667 --> 30:49.167
Same.

30:49.233 --> 30:50.767
I ain't gotta tell you
all this gun play and copying

30:50.833 --> 30:52.200
ain't good for business.

30:52.267 --> 30:55.700
But fucking with civilians,
that's outta bounds, yo.

30:55.767 --> 30:58.300
I know you know that.

30:58.367 --> 31:00.200
So this shit
gotta end now.

31:00.267 --> 31:02.100
No doubt.

31:02.167 --> 31:03.867
What's the deal?

31:03.933 --> 31:06.400
Them two blocks off
murdering the playground,

31:06.467 --> 31:08.067
that's you.

31:08.133 --> 31:11.333
Them three startin'
the Kennedys, that's me.

31:11.400 --> 31:13.667
Everybody can get back
to gettin' this money.

31:13.733 --> 31:15.433
You good with that?

31:15.500 --> 31:18.433
Yeah, I fucks with it, but...

31:18.500 --> 31:20.067
Somebody gotta pay for Tina.

31:20.067 --> 31:22.500
That was my nigga Dice's chick.
She was a civilian.

31:22.567 --> 31:24.267
What the fuck you talkin' about?
What the fuck, man!

31:24.333 --> 31:26.933
What?
I told you to
leave her alone, right?

31:27.067 --> 31:28.233
I ain't do that shit.
Yeah, you did, nigga!

31:28.300 --> 31:30.167
What the fuck
is wrong with you, huh?

31:30.233 --> 31:31.700
Who you talkin' to, nigga?
I'm talkin' to you,
mother fucker!

31:31.767 --> 31:33.967
Oh, shit!

31:35.900 --> 31:37.200
Oh, fuck, man!

31:37.267 --> 31:38.300
We good?

31:38.367 --> 31:42.433
Yeah, we, uh...

31:42.500 --> 31:44.833
We good.

31:46.100 --> 31:49.133
Yo, for real, my nigga?

31:51.367 --> 31:53.900
We out.

32:04.667 --> 32:05.800
How y'all doin'?

32:05.867 --> 32:07.533
Sound good, sound good.

32:07.600 --> 32:09.300
Aw, man!

32:09.367 --> 32:11.400
Thank you so much
for y'all patience.

32:11.467 --> 32:13.567
I'll be right back,
and we'll get the show started.

32:15.467 --> 32:17.333
Where the hell is he?

32:17.400 --> 32:20.200
I wish Damita wasn't
persona non grata around here.

32:20.267 --> 32:21.367
She would have loved
to see this.

32:21.433 --> 32:23.733
So what's up?
He still ain't here yet?

32:23.800 --> 32:26.067
Well, he--
Aw, see I knew it!

32:26.067 --> 32:28.367
You talk a big game,
Nikki Jones,

32:28.433 --> 32:30.800
but hustling is about
backing it up.

32:30.867 --> 32:32.600
Damn!

32:32.667 --> 32:35.300
Hey.
A'ight.

32:35.367 --> 32:37.433
Let's do it.

32:37.500 --> 32:39.900
My man.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

32:39.967 --> 32:44.100
All right.
Whew!

33:03.900 --> 33:05.400
Let's go get it.

33:08.567 --> 33:10.300
I wanna thank y'all
for coming out,

33:10.367 --> 33:13.633
joining us to celebrate
the launch of Fouray Records.

33:13.700 --> 33:15.267
Give it up.

33:16.867 --> 33:18.233
Any way, with no further ado,

33:18.300 --> 33:21.633
I'm gonna bring to the stage
a special artist,

33:21.700 --> 33:23.900
emcee, DJ.

33:23.967 --> 33:27.067
Give it up for Ahm
and DeeVee!

33:38.267 --> 33:41.333
Put your hands up!
Everybody put your hands up!

33:41.400 --> 33:43.633
Hands up!
Hands up!

33:43.700 --> 33:44.967
Hey!

33:45.067 --> 33:46.433
Ladies and gentlemen,

33:46.500 --> 33:51.267
you are now listening
to the sounds of Ahm,

33:51.333 --> 33:54.367
and super producer DJ DeeVee!

33:56.333 --> 33:58.933
Word, peace to my man
David, man.

33:59.067 --> 34:00.433
We miss you.

34:00.500 --> 34:02.900
We're gonna do
this one for you.

34:02.967 --> 34:07.100
Uh-huh.
Hey, yo, Ahm.

34:07.167 --> 34:08.900
Talk to the people.
Hey!

34:48.600 --> 34:50.067
Ahm. Listen.

34:50.100 --> 34:51.900
One time for your mind,
this nigga's Ahm.

34:51.967 --> 34:53.367
I'm DeeVee, what's up?

35:08.400 --> 35:09.533
Listen.

35:09.600 --> 35:10.733
Hey, yo, Ahm,
we gotta take it back.

35:12.067 --> 35:14.167
We gotta show 'em how we do.
Yeah, listen.

35:33.967 --> 35:35.067
Rebel!

35:35.067 --> 35:36.367
Rhythm!

35:53.767 --> 35:55.067
Ahm. Listen.

35:55.133 --> 35:57.133
His name is Ahm,
my name is DeeVee.

35:57.200 --> 35:58.933
Let's do this thing!

36:02.167 --> 36:03.500
One! One!

36:03.567 --> 36:05.767
Louder, louder!

36:07.200 --> 36:08.467
One! One!

36:12.433 --> 36:13.433
One, one!

36:13.500 --> 36:16.067
Listen.
Hey yo, Dee.

36:16.067 --> 36:18.600
Smoke, R.I.P.
It's Ahm, Ahm.

36:21.367 --> 36:24.300
Yeah. Ahm, Ahm.

36:29.667 --> 36:32.133
Yeah!

36:34.467 --> 36:37.500
It's Fouray Records,
like I said, right?

36:37.567 --> 36:40.067
Yo, give it up for my man Ahm,
right here.

36:41.167 --> 36:42.533
I love this kid.
I love this kid.

36:42.600 --> 36:45.333
Give it up for my man
right here, DJ DeeVee.

36:45.400 --> 36:49.500
On the wax right here.
On the wheels of steel.

36:49.567 --> 36:51.300
Thank y'all, man, so much.

36:51.367 --> 36:53.500
It feel good
to have y'all out here.

36:53.567 --> 36:57.067
You know, so many people
counted me out.

36:57.100 --> 37:01.067
You know, when shit got dark.
You know what I'm saying?

37:01.067 --> 37:02.133
But we here now, right?

37:02.200 --> 37:03.167
Yeah!

37:03.233 --> 37:04.233
We here, right?

37:04.300 --> 37:05.433
Right!

37:05.500 --> 37:07.167
Yep, fuck it,
and we family, right?

37:08.733 --> 37:13.433
Tonight, Fouray Records
struck a distribution deal...

37:13.500 --> 37:15.400
with Bainbridge Music.

37:16.700 --> 37:18.667
That's a serious deal.
Give it up!

37:20.267 --> 37:21.600
Yo, matter of fact,

37:21.667 --> 37:23.600
Orson Bainbridge
is in the house, y'all.

37:23.667 --> 37:25.867
Come to the stage and speak
to the people right here.

37:25.933 --> 37:28.767
Give it up, y'all.
Orson Bainbridge.

37:30.133 --> 37:34.467
Thank you so much.
I appreciate it.

37:36.133 --> 37:37.933
Wow. Wow, wow, wow,
wow, wow.

37:38.067 --> 37:39.933
Deep, I mean that sincerely.

37:40.067 --> 37:42.167
You know, I, uh--

37:42.233 --> 37:44.567
I've been in this business
a long time.

37:44.633 --> 37:46.267
And, uh...

37:46.333 --> 37:48.867
I think we got something
real good right here.

37:48.933 --> 37:52.167
You know, this roster,
Fouray at the helm,

37:52.233 --> 37:58.067
his Vice President
Lil Ray Washington
is number two.

37:58.133 --> 38:01.367
We are going to make history.

38:01.433 --> 38:03.533
We're gonna make history,
you know?

38:03.600 --> 38:06.667
And I've seen history made
and it feels like this.

38:06.733 --> 38:09.433
You know?
It feels like this.

38:09.500 --> 38:10.867
Nikki!
How about another song?

38:10.933 --> 38:12.667
Nikki!
Nikki!

38:12.733 --> 38:14.900
I should have known.
Look, it's not like that.

38:14.967 --> 38:17.600
It's just that this Bainbridge,
I'm a new label,

38:17.667 --> 38:19.733
and he wants an experienced
number two.

38:19.800 --> 38:22.333
So you just went
right along, huh?

38:24.467 --> 38:25.700
A boss has to be tough,

38:25.767 --> 38:27.067
and to make some
tough decisions.

38:27.133 --> 38:29.800
But look, I see what
you do for me, Nikki.

38:29.867 --> 38:30.867
I do.

38:30.933 --> 38:33.467
So I'm axed out.
No.

38:33.533 --> 38:36.500
I wouldn't do you like that.

38:36.567 --> 38:40.833
Take the office.
Head of A&R.

38:40.900 --> 38:43.100
Take the 60.

38:43.167 --> 38:47.700
I'm a lot of things,
but I'm not a liar,
Nikki Jones.

38:47.767 --> 38:51.933
We gotta show 'em how we do it.

38:52.067 --> 38:54.133
I need to think about it.

38:54.200 --> 38:56.567
Okay.

39:28.067 --> 39:30.067
Ahm!

39:42.167 --> 39:47.633
And Fouray signed DeeVee
and the kid who's on this tape?

39:47.700 --> 39:49.067
Yep.

39:49.133 --> 39:51.633
And Bainbridge is backin' 'em.

39:51.700 --> 39:54.200
Yeah.

39:54.267 --> 39:55.900
Well, you've got a big decision
to make, huh?

39:55.967 --> 40:00.200
Two jobs.
One with EBJ, one with Fouray.

40:00.267 --> 40:06.033
Assistant to A&R
in less than two months.

40:06.100 --> 40:09.000
Proud of you, kid.

40:09.067 --> 40:12.433
You know what you wanna do?

40:14.000 --> 40:15.467
I'm in agony over here.

40:15.533 --> 40:17.133
Barry or Mattie,
who's it gonna be?

40:17.200 --> 40:19.067
You.

40:20.767 --> 40:24.933
I want to start
a new label with you.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.400
What do you say?

40:30.600 --> 40:32.400
I got a better idea.

40:46.200 --> 40:48.200
You hear that?

40:48.267 --> 40:50.167
That's the sample
from Ahm's record.

40:50.233 --> 40:54.400
That's right.
And I own it.

40:55.633 --> 40:59.433
What do you say we start
ourselves a label,

40:59.500 --> 41:03.167
and we destroy your old boss
at the same time?
