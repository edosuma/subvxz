00:06.865 --> 00:08.131
Well, that about wraps up

00:08.251 --> 00:09.788
Taco Corp's
annual board meeting.

00:09.985 --> 00:11.952
All in favor, say aye.

00:12.037 --> 00:13.070
Yes, Lord.

00:13.155 --> 00:15.038
Cheers, Marshawn.

00:15.074 --> 00:16.540
Cheers to Taco Corp.

00:16.575 --> 00:18.375
Cheers. Well, as you know,

00:18.410 --> 00:20.544
Taco Corp had a record year.

00:20.579 --> 00:23.630
So I'm gonna be paying you
your dividend in Skittles.

00:23.716 --> 00:25.883
Come on, man, you know
that's my thing, right, brah?

00:25.918 --> 00:27.301
No, I had no idea.

00:27.386 --> 00:28.502
That's how I pay everyone.

00:28.587 --> 00:29.753
- What?
- Taco!

00:29.805 --> 00:31.421
If you're, uh, done
with your meeting,

00:31.507 --> 00:32.673
can I have a beer, please?

00:32.758 --> 00:34.424
Yeah, sure.

00:34.510 --> 00:36.343
Ooh.

00:36.428 --> 00:37.761
Last one.

00:37.846 --> 00:40.147
Just hand it to me,
and I'll run it over to him.

00:40.232 --> 00:41.598
Nah, I'll toss it to him.

00:41.650 --> 00:42.933
Just hand it to me.

00:42.985 --> 00:44.017
No need to throw it, man.
Come on.

00:44.103 --> 00:45.319
No, it's really easy.

00:45.404 --> 00:46.770
I'll just throw it to him,
he'll catch it.

00:46.822 --> 00:48.272
Come on, man, we're so close.
I could run it over.

00:48.324 --> 00:49.940
It's just right here.

00:49.992 --> 00:51.658
I just want a beer.

00:51.744 --> 00:52.826
Come on, man,

00:52.912 --> 00:54.995
I can sleepwalk
that thing to him, boy.

00:55.080 --> 00:56.363
Come on, man.

00:56.448 --> 00:58.582
All right. Eh.

00:58.617 --> 01:00.534
I think I'm gonna throw it.
What's the worst

01:00.619 --> 01:02.419
that could happen? Catch.

01:02.454 --> 01:03.420
What? No, no, no!

01:03.455 --> 01:05.589
No, no, Taco! Oh!

01:05.624 --> 01:06.373
Whoa.

01:08.544 --> 01:10.127
I'm on fire!
I'm burning!

01:10.212 --> 01:11.345
Help!

01:11.430 --> 01:12.963
Help! Help me!
That's why you run it.

01:13.048 --> 01:15.265
Fire! Fire! Fire!

01:15.301 --> 01:16.433
Still think
it was the right call.

01:16.502 --> 01:17.434
Fire!

01:17.554 --> 01:22.884
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:23.004 --> 01:25.809
Come on, Tottenham!
You get 'em there, lads!

01:25.861 --> 01:26.977
Get 'em there!

01:27.029 --> 01:29.146
♪ Olé, olé, olé, olé... ♪

01:29.231 --> 01:31.148
Please, please, please, Andre.

01:31.200 --> 01:32.282
What? Come on.
Stop.

01:32.318 --> 01:33.817
What's the score?
Am I winning?

01:33.869 --> 01:36.370
The score is Andre zero
and you have zero.

01:36.455 --> 01:37.904
Right.
Yeah,

01:37.990 --> 01:39.873
well, there's a six-way tie
at the top for first

01:39.959 --> 01:41.325
with zero points.

01:41.377 --> 01:43.043
- Soccer sucks.
- Fantasy soccer sucks.

01:43.128 --> 01:46.663
We need to figure out
a new point system,

01:46.715 --> 01:47.881
'cause there's not
enough scoring here.

01:47.967 --> 01:50.801
Like, you get a point
every time a dude flops

01:50.836 --> 01:53.553
or the supporters of your team
start a riot.

01:53.639 --> 01:56.590
I am so glad that the NFL draft
is in Chicago next week.

01:56.675 --> 01:58.342
I cannot wait
for football season

01:58.394 --> 01:59.810
to start back up.

01:59.845 --> 02:01.311
I found myself going
back to our league site,

02:01.347 --> 02:03.180
just checking in
like a serial killer

02:03.232 --> 02:04.632
returning to the scene
of his crime.

02:04.650 --> 02:05.732
Speaking of crime scenes,

02:05.818 --> 02:08.185
we are trying to
potty train CB...

02:08.270 --> 02:09.568
Chalupa Batman.

02:09.655 --> 02:11.438
...and it is not going well.

02:11.523 --> 02:13.740
So if you see some mounds
or puddles on the ground,

02:13.826 --> 02:16.159
just quietly
notify us, please.

02:16.195 --> 02:17.944
I did see a wet mound out there
in the hallway.

02:18.030 --> 02:19.196
Just assumed
it was yours, Kevin.

02:19.281 --> 02:21.281
Very funny. It's not mine.
Are you sure?

02:21.367 --> 02:22.699
'Cause there's a bunch
of Pete's pubic hair in it.

02:23.786 --> 02:25.252
Sorry I'm late, guys.

02:25.337 --> 02:26.620
Went into overtime.

02:26.705 --> 02:27.921
Oh, there he is,

02:28.007 --> 02:29.873
the guy who can't get
his own life together,

02:29.958 --> 02:31.875
yet runs around on a field
telling other people what to do.

02:31.960 --> 02:33.010
What can I say?

02:33.045 --> 02:34.378
I like being a ref.

02:34.430 --> 02:36.096
It's very rare that
a man in my position

02:36.181 --> 02:37.964
gets to be a total dictator,
and I appreciate it.

02:38.050 --> 02:40.384
You're like the Stalin
of JV girls' volleyball.

02:40.469 --> 02:42.269
Um, actually, Pete,
I have a question.

02:42.354 --> 02:43.970
Where did you get the outfit?

02:44.056 --> 02:45.472
Foot Locker?

02:45.557 --> 02:47.524
Um, yeah, actually, I did.

02:47.559 --> 02:48.809
That would be the place
to get something like that.

02:48.894 --> 02:49.943
It's logical.

02:50.029 --> 02:51.611
So...
Burn.

02:51.697 --> 02:53.063
Yeah.

02:53.115 --> 02:54.981
All right, so, guys,

02:55.067 --> 02:57.234
today is
the fantasy football equinox.

02:57.319 --> 02:58.902
The exact midpoint

02:58.987 --> 03:00.787
between the last game
of the 2014 season

03:00.873 --> 03:02.656
and the first game
of the 2015 season.

03:02.741 --> 03:03.822
Yes.
So without further ado,

03:03.826 --> 03:04.991
if you would follow me.

03:05.077 --> 03:07.127
Just finish up the game.

03:07.212 --> 03:08.328
Thank you very much.
Okay.

03:08.414 --> 03:09.963
Delay of game, let's go.

03:10.049 --> 03:11.498
Let's go.

03:11.583 --> 03:12.966
It's cool that they give you flags.
Yeah.

03:13.052 --> 03:14.418
Oh, Andre,

03:14.470 --> 03:17.087
since our Shiva was
pretty badly burned last season,

03:17.139 --> 03:19.056
we thought it was appropriate
that our champion

03:19.091 --> 03:20.590
got a new trophy.

03:20.676 --> 03:24.061
"Ooh, all right, all right."

03:24.096 --> 03:25.679
Matthew McConaughey.

03:25.764 --> 03:27.147
Behind door number one.

03:27.232 --> 03:28.899
Ooh.

03:28.934 --> 03:30.851
I like that.

03:30.936 --> 03:33.320
Wait, you made a bronze turd?

03:33.405 --> 03:35.405
Hmm-mm-mm, I found
a real turd

03:35.441 --> 03:37.607
and I spray-painted it
with bronze paint.

03:37.693 --> 03:38.742
Oh, no, that's gross.

03:38.777 --> 03:39.826
Well, that's how we felt

03:39.912 --> 03:41.278
when you won the championship.

03:41.330 --> 03:42.362
Well, perhaps you'll like

03:42.448 --> 03:43.613
this one better.

03:43.665 --> 03:46.116
I like to call it
"When SheDre Met

03:46.168 --> 03:47.751
HeDre." Huh?

03:47.786 --> 03:48.952
What do you think?

03:49.037 --> 03:50.921
It's actually not bad.
I like it.

03:50.956 --> 03:52.122
What?

03:52.174 --> 03:53.256
It's perfect.

03:53.292 --> 03:54.758
Oh, my gosh, I love it.
It's great.

03:54.793 --> 03:56.927
Oh, shit.

03:56.962 --> 03:58.595
All right, it's out.
Yeah, you don't get that one.

03:58.630 --> 03:59.296
- No. What?
- All right, Andre,

03:59.381 --> 04:00.597
I want you to know

04:00.632 --> 04:02.632
I spent a lot of time,
money and thought on this,

04:02.684 --> 04:04.101
and I'm very proud.
Just show me the stupid thing.

04:04.136 --> 04:05.635
No, let me finish my mislead.

04:05.721 --> 04:08.221
And so I really hope that
you enjoy what I've created.

04:08.307 --> 04:09.106
Okay, thank you.

04:09.141 --> 04:11.358
Ta-da!

04:11.443 --> 04:13.477
This is an original
Kluneberg design.

04:13.562 --> 04:15.061
You are wearing a hoodie

04:15.147 --> 04:17.647
just like fellow tainted
champion Bill Belichick.

04:17.733 --> 04:19.449
And to that point,

04:19.485 --> 04:21.618
you will also notice
that the two footballs here

04:21.653 --> 04:23.403
are just slightly deflated,

04:23.489 --> 04:25.038
like your soggy cum buckets.

04:25.124 --> 04:26.323
The wrinkles
in the sweatshirt

04:26.375 --> 04:27.491
are so veiny.

04:27.576 --> 04:28.658
The final statue

04:28.744 --> 04:31.411
will have a fountain feature

04:31.497 --> 04:33.997
with a sour sauce
shooting out the top.

04:34.082 --> 04:35.165
No, stop the R & D.

04:35.250 --> 04:36.249
I don't want that.

04:36.335 --> 04:37.384
Ooh! Ooh! My turn.

04:39.004 --> 04:41.171
I present to you...

04:41.223 --> 04:44.341
the fantasy football trophy.

04:44.426 --> 04:46.226
Stuff from Ménage à Cinq.
Yeah.

04:46.311 --> 04:47.644
Your business failed.

04:47.679 --> 04:48.645
Taco.

04:48.680 --> 04:50.347
It's not 2013.

04:50.432 --> 04:51.848
I know, that's the joke.

04:51.900 --> 04:52.983
Wait, what's the joke?

04:53.018 --> 04:55.519
This guy doesn't get it.

04:55.604 --> 04:58.021
Andre, let me show you the
trophy you are going to pick.

04:58.073 --> 04:59.156
Oh, exciting.

04:59.191 --> 05:00.407
Da-da-da-da!

05:00.492 --> 05:02.159
Whoa!

05:02.194 --> 05:03.527
The Dre is back, baby.

05:03.612 --> 05:05.245
Oh, not so fast.

05:05.330 --> 05:06.446
It's not done yet.

05:06.532 --> 05:07.948
I call it...

05:09.368 --> 05:11.501
...Dre on Dre.

05:11.537 --> 05:13.870
Ooh, you can see the point
of Dre-nal entry.

05:13.956 --> 05:15.622
Wait, what is the one Dre doing
to the other Dre?

05:15.707 --> 05:17.707
It just commemorates the moment
that the Dre

05:17.759 --> 05:21.211
really became a living legend
and a part of your anatomy.

05:21.263 --> 05:23.880
No, no, I'm not choosing
any of these, okay?

05:23.932 --> 05:25.048
'Cause they suck.

05:25.133 --> 05:26.466
Hey!

05:26.552 --> 05:28.685
We worked really hard
on these, Andre.

05:28.720 --> 05:30.604
I'm sorry, Ruxin,
I, I don't mean to upset you.

05:30.689 --> 05:32.722
I just feel like when you guys
are all coming at me like this,

05:32.774 --> 05:33.940
it's like, I don't know,

05:34.026 --> 05:35.225
you're making fun of me
or something.

05:35.310 --> 05:37.310
'Cause I feel like when I look
at it at face value,

05:37.362 --> 05:39.863
I just see, like, a big poop,
me kissing myself,

05:39.898 --> 05:42.482
me as a dick, a reminder
that my restaurant failed,

05:42.568 --> 05:43.650
and me putting my hand
in my ass.

05:43.735 --> 05:45.402
I think we're probably
just jealous.

05:45.487 --> 05:46.903
Yeah.
I mean, you did win

05:46.989 --> 05:47.988
Ted's beach house.

05:48.073 --> 05:49.406
Yeah, some beach house.

05:49.491 --> 05:50.991
Talked to
the insurance company today,

05:51.076 --> 05:54.578
and apparently I owe $150,000
due to all the fire damage.

05:54.663 --> 05:55.745
What?

05:55.797 --> 05:57.247
That's so much money.

05:57.299 --> 05:59.299
It's not an asset anymore.
It's a deficit.

05:59.384 --> 06:00.584
As a matter of fact,

06:00.669 --> 06:02.252
whoever wins the Sacko
this year,

06:02.304 --> 06:03.553
they get the house.

06:03.589 --> 06:04.588
Hmm, that's interesting.

06:04.673 --> 06:05.633
Yeah, I kind of like it.

06:05.674 --> 06:06.973
Speaking of the Sacko,

06:07.059 --> 06:08.225
I do think it's time
we turn our attention

06:08.260 --> 06:09.341
to this year's loser, Taco.

06:09.344 --> 06:10.594
That could be said

06:10.646 --> 06:12.145
about every year.
I think we should begin

06:12.231 --> 06:13.513
with a small

06:13.599 --> 06:14.931
but disgusting task--

06:15.017 --> 06:16.850
no more toilets for you.

06:16.935 --> 06:19.402
You can only use a Porta Potti
for the next month.

06:19.438 --> 06:21.438
Ooh.
What about sleeping?

06:21.490 --> 06:23.940
What? No, no, you can't sleep
on a toilet either.

06:24.026 --> 06:25.442
So I can only have sex
on a toilet?

06:25.527 --> 06:26.076
Okay.

06:26.111 --> 06:27.277
No, stop it.

06:27.362 --> 06:28.411
Harsh.

06:34.369 --> 06:35.452
Pete?

06:36.788 --> 06:37.704
Pete.

06:37.789 --> 06:38.922
Meegan?

06:38.957 --> 06:41.124
Holy shit.
Do we hug?

06:41.209 --> 06:43.093
Oh, let's try it. Oh, my God.
Hi.

06:43.128 --> 06:44.928
My God, it's so nice to see you.
This is crazy. I'm gonna just call it.

06:44.963 --> 06:45.929
What?

06:45.964 --> 06:47.597
Five years.

06:47.633 --> 06:50.050
It's literally been five years
since we've seen each other.

06:50.135 --> 06:51.468
Five years, yeah.
What is going on? How are you?

06:51.553 --> 06:52.719
I mean, look, you look great.
What's happening?

06:52.804 --> 06:53.770
Um, thank you.

06:53.805 --> 06:55.522
I moved out west.

06:55.607 --> 06:56.773
Okay.

06:56.808 --> 06:58.129
I was working in PR.
Now I'm back.

06:58.143 --> 06:59.309
What?
This is crazy,

06:59.394 --> 07:00.310
'cause I was thinking of you
the other day.

07:00.395 --> 07:01.478
Why?

07:01.530 --> 07:02.812
Don't take this the wrong way,

07:02.864 --> 07:04.531
but I saw this really dumb dog
eating a pinecone,

07:04.616 --> 07:06.232
and I remembered...

07:06.318 --> 07:08.451
Oh, my God, the Down doggy, which...
Down doggy.

07:08.487 --> 07:10.487
You know what?
I owe you an apology.

07:10.539 --> 07:12.906
You were right.
The difference between, like,

07:12.991 --> 07:15.825
a Down syndrome dog
and just a regular dog,

07:15.911 --> 07:17.377
it's like negligible.
The difference is, like,

07:17.462 --> 07:18.828
it's that.
It's negligible.

07:18.914 --> 07:21.748
It's really nice to see you.

07:21.833 --> 07:23.416
I mean, what's the, what's the,
what's the protocol here?

07:23.502 --> 07:25.635
Like, are you busy?
Can we get a drink now?

07:25.671 --> 07:27.420
I just, I have to go put money
in my meter,

07:27.506 --> 07:28.972
and I don't want to get a ticket, so...
Oh, yeah, sure. Well, look,

07:29.007 --> 07:30.840
my number's still the same.
We'll do it some other time.

07:30.926 --> 07:32.475
Ay...

07:32.511 --> 07:35.178
So is mine.

07:35.263 --> 07:36.730
Oh, is that a skort you're wearing?
Know what they say.

07:36.815 --> 07:40.650
Business in the front,
party in the back.

07:42.571 --> 07:44.437
<i> Yeah, I mean, I was</i>
<i>a little nervous obviously</i>

07:44.523 --> 07:46.022
'cause I hadn't seen her in forever,
Sure.

07:46.074 --> 07:47.657
but, got to say, it was...
it was pretty cool.

07:47.693 --> 07:49.442
Great, that's good.
Good, that's good, yeah.

07:49.528 --> 07:50.827
So how'd you guys leave it?

07:50.862 --> 07:52.529
Well, she had to run
and put money in the meter,

07:52.614 --> 07:54.030
but, you know, I think
we'll catch up later.

07:54.082 --> 07:55.198
Hmm.

07:55.283 --> 07:56.533
That's a classic
conversation ender.

07:56.618 --> 07:58.368
What are you talking about?
I mean, we all have one.

07:58.453 --> 07:59.869
Yeah, when you're in,
like, a boring conversation

07:59.955 --> 08:01.371
that you want to get out of,
you go like,

08:01.423 --> 08:03.206
"Ooh, criminy, forgot my keys."

08:04.876 --> 08:06.343
And then you bounce,
you're out of the convo.

08:06.378 --> 08:07.677
Yeah, mine's similar.

08:07.713 --> 08:09.793
I say, "Oh, no, I don't want
to talk to you anymore."

08:09.798 --> 08:11.181
Fools 'em every time.

08:11.216 --> 08:12.432
Good, good.
Doesn't it?

08:12.517 --> 08:14.434
Yeah, well, this was
clearly not that.

08:14.519 --> 08:15.719
I'm getting another beer;
anybody want anything?

08:15.804 --> 08:16.844
- No.
- I'm good.

08:16.855 --> 08:17.887
All right.

08:17.973 --> 08:19.522
- Ooh.
- Oh, man.

08:19.558 --> 08:21.474
He has no idea, does he?
Uh-uh.

08:21.560 --> 08:22.976
None.
Well, we have to tell him.

08:23.061 --> 08:24.444
Feel free.
I'm not telling him.

08:24.529 --> 08:25.812
I'm not telling him either.
I'm not telling him.

08:25.897 --> 08:26.813
This is great.

08:26.898 --> 08:28.565
Hey, I forgot to tell you:

08:28.617 --> 08:30.984
I ran into Pete today
on the street.

08:31.069 --> 08:32.619
I was kind of freaked out,
I was like,

08:32.703 --> 08:33.903
"Oh, my God,
is he gonna be weird?"

08:33.955 --> 08:35.321
But he wasn't, he was great,

08:35.407 --> 08:38.207
I just... I didn't know
what to say to him, you know?

08:39.578 --> 08:40.818
So when are you gonna tell him?

08:43.298 --> 08:45.382
Soon, my love, I promise.

08:51.841 --> 08:53.174
<i>Hello?</i>

08:53.259 --> 08:55.292
Aah, still at the mall.

08:55.378 --> 08:57.011
Which means I have
a little alone time.

08:57.096 --> 08:59.547
Watch a little
<i>Path to the Dra...</i>

08:59.632 --> 09:00.848
What?!

09:00.933 --> 09:02.933
What is this?!

09:02.969 --> 09:03.851
No, Taco.
Hey.

09:03.936 --> 09:04.852
Goddamn it.

09:04.937 --> 09:05.970
What is this?

09:06.055 --> 09:07.021
The newspaper?

09:07.106 --> 09:08.105
It's the <i> Ny Times.</i>

09:08.141 --> 09:10.107
No. No, I'm talking about

09:10.143 --> 09:12.360
the gigantic Porta Potti
in my living room.

09:12.445 --> 09:14.111
Oh, well, you guys told me

09:14.147 --> 09:16.147
I can only use Porta Potties
to go to the bathroom,

09:16.149 --> 09:17.782
and I always go
to the bathroom here, so...

09:17.817 --> 09:19.700
What's wrong with the bathroom
at your house?

09:19.786 --> 09:21.152
I haven't had a working one
in months.

09:21.204 --> 09:22.903
Don't try to flush a dead
raccoon down the toilet.

09:22.989 --> 09:24.071
Does not work.

09:24.157 --> 09:25.790
When is this thing going
to be leaving?

09:25.825 --> 09:27.375
Well, that's up to you guys.

09:27.460 --> 09:29.493
But check this out.

09:29.545 --> 09:32.463
Put the Ruxin in there
for added humiliation.

09:34.333 --> 09:37.385
I am shamed, sir, I am shamed.

09:41.007 --> 09:43.974
Oh, man, you should really keep
it in the house permanently.

09:44.010 --> 09:45.226
It goes with the
rest of the decor.

09:45.311 --> 09:46.632
I've been trying
to get rid of it,

09:46.646 --> 09:48.396
but the company won't pick it up
till next Wednesday.

09:48.481 --> 09:50.898
This punishment totally
backfired on me.

09:50.983 --> 09:53.067
Guys, what is my
next punishment?

09:53.152 --> 09:55.152
I am loving
this. Look,

09:55.188 --> 09:57.021
I know you guys love shoving
things into people's butts,

09:57.106 --> 09:58.656
that's all you guys
ever talk about.

09:58.691 --> 10:00.691
So I figured that's
what was gonna be next,

10:00.777 --> 10:03.744
so I cut a hole in my jeans
to make it easier for you.

10:03.830 --> 10:04.862
No. No.

10:04.947 --> 10:06.197
Come on, shove
something in there.

10:06.249 --> 10:08.115
Why does it smell
like menthol cigarettes?

10:08.201 --> 10:09.867
Taco, no more punishments.

10:09.919 --> 10:11.869
You are not supposed
to be enjoying them.

10:11.921 --> 10:13.482
Guys, I realized
something about myself.

10:13.506 --> 10:15.539
I love being hazed.

10:15.591 --> 10:17.508
I guess it's because
in my everyday life

10:17.543 --> 10:19.260
I'm so in control all the time

10:19.345 --> 10:22.963
that it's so nice to give that
up, even for a brief moment.

10:23.049 --> 10:25.182
Come on, shove something
in my butt.

10:25.218 --> 10:27.051
Brother, can you spare a finger?

10:27.103 --> 10:29.937
You want your brother to shove
a finger up your asshole?

10:30.022 --> 10:31.722
Yeah, it's a little weird.

10:31.774 --> 10:33.974
Ruxin, shove a
finger in my butt.

10:34.060 --> 10:36.026
It smells like Bolognese now.

10:36.062 --> 10:38.062
- How did it change smells?
- Oh, my God!

10:38.114 --> 10:40.397
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my
God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - What? What?

10:40.450 --> 10:42.731
Do you remember how the Bears
were having that sweepstakes

10:42.735 --> 10:44.869
for a fan to announce
one of the draft picks?

10:44.904 --> 10:46.287
Yeah.
I don't remember that.

10:46.372 --> 10:47.404
I won it.

10:47.490 --> 10:49.406
No way.
I am going to announce

10:49.492 --> 10:51.542
the third-round
draft pick this year!

10:51.577 --> 10:53.744
Holy shit, babe, that's awesome.

10:53.796 --> 10:56.380
Uh, and it is my birthday, too.
I know it is.

10:56.415 --> 10:57.882
And guess who I get to do it with.
Who?

10:57.917 --> 10:59.500
Jim McMahon.

10:59.585 --> 11:00.668
No way!

11:00.753 --> 11:02.419
Brian?!

11:02.505 --> 11:04.004
What's up, everybody?

11:04.090 --> 11:07.675
I am loving this new
kitchen setup.

11:07.760 --> 11:10.144
It is so much easier
to shit while I cook.

11:10.229 --> 11:12.646
Speaking of which,

11:12.732 --> 11:14.598
who wants garlic bread?

11:14.650 --> 11:15.566
No.

11:15.601 --> 11:17.601
Fresh out of the oven?

11:17.687 --> 11:19.153
Ooh, ooh, ooh, shove it in here.

11:19.238 --> 11:20.118
Oh, look at this.

11:20.189 --> 11:21.906
Taco came dressed to eat.

11:21.941 --> 11:24.108
Just a good old-fashioned
garlic bread butt-shove.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.025
Ugh.

11:27.747 --> 11:29.246
I feel like I'm having
my darkest days

11:29.282 --> 11:30.802
as the Sacko commissioner
here. I mean,

11:30.867 --> 11:32.950
how do you haze someone
who generally likes being naked,

11:33.035 --> 11:34.001
likes being drugged,

11:34.086 --> 11:35.753
likes week-old
sushi.

11:35.788 --> 11:37.121
He didn't even mind it
when I put him in a box

11:37.206 --> 11:38.289
and shipped him off to Canada.

11:38.341 --> 11:40.925
I mean, Taco is
essentially unsackable.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.126
There has to be something.

11:42.211 --> 11:43.711
Make him read a book.

11:43.796 --> 11:45.296
Make him be monogamous.

11:45.381 --> 11:46.463
Ugh.
Yeah.

11:46.549 --> 11:47.631
Well, I can't think

11:47.717 --> 11:48.883
about how to punish
this plankton anymore.

11:48.968 --> 11:50.134
I got to get back to work.

11:50.186 --> 11:52.553
Wait. That's it.

11:52.638 --> 11:55.272
What if his punishment
is he has to go to work?

11:55.308 --> 11:57.725
Yes, a real job.

11:57.810 --> 11:59.527
Yes. 40-hours-a-week real job.
Yeah,

11:59.612 --> 12:01.278
like at a bank as an intern,
and he has to wear a suit

12:01.314 --> 12:02.754
and get yelled at,
like me every day.

12:02.815 --> 12:05.733
Yes, and he has to try really
hard-- no slacking off.

12:05.818 --> 12:07.318
Well, looks like my
work here is done.

12:07.370 --> 12:08.619
So...

12:10.039 --> 12:12.289
I will be heading off to
referee my night game.

12:12.325 --> 12:14.074
Andre, movie tomorrow night?

12:14.160 --> 12:16.210
Uh, uh, yeah.

12:16.295 --> 12:18.295
Maybe.
I'll just check my thing.

12:18.331 --> 12:21.916
Check your thing?
Andre, you have got to tell him.

12:22.001 --> 12:23.500
It's hard, okay? I haven't found the right time.
There is no right time.

12:23.586 --> 12:25.586
- What are you doing?
- Yeah, it's like buying

12:25.671 --> 12:27.638
one of your hats. You just hold
your nose and do it.

12:27.673 --> 12:29.757
Ah, the joke's on you.
I don't choose my hats.

12:29.842 --> 12:31.759
They choose me.

12:34.180 --> 12:36.680
As you know, my birthday is coming up.
I know. I'm so excited.

12:36.766 --> 12:39.733
And we both know
that you are not the best

12:39.819 --> 12:43.020
at purchasing birthday presents, right?
I'm terrible.

12:43.105 --> 12:44.488
The year you got me
the fishing pole...

12:44.523 --> 12:46.273
You love fish.
Yes.

12:46.359 --> 12:48.909
I also love lobster,
but you didn't get me a trap.

12:48.995 --> 12:52.446
- Okay, so this year I'm gonna make it
real easy for you, okay? - Mm-hmm. Great.

12:52.531 --> 12:55.583
- All I want for my birthday
is to announce the pick. - Okay.

12:55.668 --> 12:58.502
Done. Happy birthday.

12:58.537 --> 13:00.537
I can't do it, babe.

13:00.590 --> 13:03.374
What? Oh...
Are you kidding me?

13:03.426 --> 13:04.708
You didn't think
that that would be something

13:04.794 --> 13:06.594
that I would've wanted?
Oh, no, I did think that.

13:06.679 --> 13:09.597
Good.
And then I won it. And then I was like,

13:09.682 --> 13:12.182
"Well, I'll just get
Kevin something better."

13:13.686 --> 13:15.135
What?
Is Taco here?

13:15.221 --> 13:17.688
Are they doing garlic bread
again in there?

13:17.723 --> 13:20.608
I'm making a pee-pee!

13:20.693 --> 13:22.977
What?
Oh, my God.

13:23.062 --> 13:24.561
We're supposed to praise him.

13:24.647 --> 13:28.313
Yay.
Yay. Good job, buddy.

13:33.869 --> 13:36.737
This is amazing.
Chi-Town is Draft Town.

13:36.822 --> 13:38.538
Oh, man.
This is awesome.

13:38.624 --> 13:40.324
Day two of the draft!

13:40.376 --> 13:42.376
Look at this. All access.
Oh!

13:42.461 --> 13:45.379
VIP. I want the VIP one.
No, I am the VIP.

13:45.464 --> 13:46.964
Can we switch? I want...
I am the VIP.

13:46.999 --> 13:49.800
Oh, look, they got
Porta Potties, just like home.

13:49.835 --> 13:52.169
You know what, stop.
I am mortified

13:52.254 --> 13:54.221
that that's the only place
CB will go to the bathroom.

13:54.306 --> 13:56.173
He's Porta Potti-trained.
It's not like the rest of his life's

13:56.258 --> 13:59.176
gonna be filled with
that many real working toilets.

13:59.228 --> 14:00.560
Hey.
The kid's gonna end up

14:00.646 --> 14:02.229
a security guard
at motocross events anyway,

14:02.314 --> 14:04.181
so this is good practice.
What's that?

14:04.233 --> 14:07.567
Kettle corn?! Sweet and salty!

14:07.653 --> 14:09.319
Calais Campbell
and the Honey Badger.

14:09.355 --> 14:11.021
I know they're your favorites.

14:11.106 --> 14:14.358
What do you want, a football
or picture? I'll get you both.

14:14.410 --> 14:15.993
Okay, yeah...
Hey, Andre. Who you talking to?

14:16.028 --> 14:19.196
Um... Uh, we... Yes, well,
start the surgery right away,

14:19.248 --> 14:21.281
and I'll-I'll be there
in a few. Work.

14:21.367 --> 14:25.002
Okay.

14:25.037 --> 14:26.870
I'm starving.
Oh, hey, skills challenge.

14:26.955 --> 14:29.256
Oh, we can do...
Hey, Kevin, real quick, uh, have you noticed

14:29.341 --> 14:32.125
Andre has been...
super weird lately? Like,

14:32.211 --> 14:34.211
even for Andre weird?
W-Weird?

14:34.263 --> 14:36.847
Yeah.
What? No. He's-he's a weird guy.

14:36.882 --> 14:37.848
He's always been weird.

14:37.883 --> 14:40.767
Weird? You're weird.

14:40.853 --> 14:43.103
It's just weird
that you would even ask that.

14:43.188 --> 14:46.056
So you-you literally
haven't noticed? Anything?

14:48.894 --> 14:50.477
Kevin...

14:50.562 --> 14:51.478
Thirsty?

14:51.563 --> 14:52.779
Yes!

14:52.865 --> 14:54.398
What is happening? Why...
Hey, hey.

14:54.450 --> 14:57.951
Babe, you have got to try
the skills challenge.

14:58.037 --> 14:59.820
Look, by the way, the fact
that you're not letting him

14:59.905 --> 15:00.871
announce the draft
pick on his birthday?

15:00.906 --> 15:01.905
That's just wrong.

15:01.990 --> 15:03.323
Oh, is it, Pete?
Yeah.

15:03.409 --> 15:04.658
What are you getting him
for his birthday?

15:04.743 --> 15:06.043
I have something very special

15:06.078 --> 15:07.077
for his birthday.
Oh, oh, oh...

15:07.129 --> 15:08.409
You know what?
Don't answer that.

15:08.414 --> 15:10.497
We already know.

15:10.582 --> 15:12.582
Was gonna say
a tandem bicycle with...

15:12.668 --> 15:14.551
penises for handlebars.

15:14.586 --> 15:16.887
Nobody appreciates
what I do for this group.

15:16.922 --> 15:17.882
Come on, you guys.

15:17.923 --> 15:19.506
I have a very, very important

15:19.591 --> 15:20.841
announcement to make...
Oh!

15:20.926 --> 15:22.809
God, Taco,
what are you doing here?

15:22.895 --> 15:23.810
What are you doing that for?

15:23.896 --> 15:24.811
Really?

15:24.897 --> 15:26.680
Guys, I love my punishment.

15:26.765 --> 15:27.931
What's the next one?

15:28.016 --> 15:29.896
Taco, you're supposed
to be an intern at a bank.

15:29.902 --> 15:31.935
I did exactly what
you guys asked me to do.

15:32.020 --> 15:33.687
I put on my suit,
I walked into the bank,

15:33.772 --> 15:35.021
I talked to the manager...

15:35.107 --> 15:37.441
Taco, you went into the bank
in your McGibblets suit?

15:37.526 --> 15:38.942
Yeah, it's the nicest
suit I own.

15:39.027 --> 15:41.361
Hello!

15:41.447 --> 15:44.114
I'm here to apply
for the job, please.

15:44.199 --> 15:45.449
Here's my résumé.

15:47.786 --> 15:49.169
Interesting résumé.

15:49.254 --> 15:50.504
Surprisingly,

15:50.589 --> 15:51.955
I've actually got a job for you.

15:52.040 --> 15:53.206
What do you do?

15:53.292 --> 15:55.125
<i>Twirl around a sign for CDs.</i>

15:55.177 --> 15:56.510
We got it all at the bank!

15:56.595 --> 15:57.794
<i>And it pays.</i>

15:57.880 --> 15:59.296
Hey, check out my sign!

15:59.348 --> 16:00.464
Hey, lady!

16:00.549 --> 16:03.266
Lady, check out my sign!

16:03.302 --> 16:05.218
Don't make me run after you!
Hey!

16:05.304 --> 16:06.984
I don't know how
this bank makes any money.

16:07.055 --> 16:08.972
No one buys CDs anymore.

16:09.024 --> 16:10.223
Let's just get going.

16:10.309 --> 16:11.108
Yeah.
Come on, we're gonna be late.

16:11.143 --> 16:12.642
All right.

16:12.694 --> 16:13.693
Whoa-ho!

16:13.779 --> 16:15.312
VIP tent, gentlemen!
Wow.

16:15.397 --> 16:17.063
Yeah, not a bad place
to watch the draft.

16:17.149 --> 16:19.399
Whoa, that is a lot
of free food.

16:19.485 --> 16:20.650
Whoo.

16:20.736 --> 16:22.486
Babe, this is amazing.

16:22.571 --> 16:24.237
Holy shit.

16:24.323 --> 16:26.373
Is that Calais Campbell
and the Honey Badger?

16:26.458 --> 16:27.791
I gotta go over and meet them.

16:27.826 --> 16:28.825
No.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

16:28.877 --> 16:30.494
I'm great with celebrities.

16:30.546 --> 16:33.163
Ah. Good morrow, gentlemen.

16:33.215 --> 16:35.549
Uh, my name is Andre, hi.
How are you?

16:35.634 --> 16:37.217
I'm Tyrann. Great to see you.
Hi, how are you?

16:37.302 --> 16:38.418
What's going on, Andre? How you doing?
Hey, man.

16:38.504 --> 16:39.585
It's pretty awesome, right?

16:39.588 --> 16:40.637
It is pretty awesome.

16:40.672 --> 16:41.872
Happy birthday.
But it would be

16:41.890 --> 16:43.757
really awesome if you
let me make the pick.

16:43.842 --> 16:45.642
No. That is not
gonna happen.

16:45.677 --> 16:46.893
But I will give you this,

16:46.979 --> 16:48.011
so you can get some free drinks.

16:48.096 --> 16:49.012
Oh.

16:49.097 --> 16:50.764
Great. Thank you.

16:50.849 --> 16:53.016
Guys, I am such a huge fan.

16:53.068 --> 16:54.017
And my girlfriend?

16:54.102 --> 16:55.152
She's even a bigger fan.

16:55.187 --> 16:56.353
I was wondering
if I could maybe get,

16:56.438 --> 16:57.354
like, a signed football or...
Yeah.

16:57.439 --> 16:58.439
...a picture
or something?

16:58.524 --> 16:59.439
Oh, thank you so much.
This is great.

16:59.525 --> 17:00.565
You know, um, my girlfriend

17:00.576 --> 17:02.325
actually calls me
the Honey Badger.

17:02.361 --> 17:03.910
Why's she call you
the Honey Badger?

17:03.996 --> 17:05.529
You know, 'cause I like to,
uh, forage around...

17:05.614 --> 17:06.663
No, no, no, no.

17:06.698 --> 17:07.664
Forget I asked, forget I asked.

17:07.699 --> 17:08.865
Okay, yeah, sure, that was...

17:08.916 --> 17:10.282
Uh, girlfriend?
What?

17:10.368 --> 17:12.169
What are you talking...
Oh, I was joking.

17:12.204 --> 17:14.119
I was joking with my new,
my new buds.

17:14.205 --> 17:15.872
This guy with a girlfriend...
I wasn't buying it.

17:15.924 --> 17:17.624
Well, it's like, you could buy
it, but it was a joke, yeah?

17:17.709 --> 17:19.259
Did sound like a lie.
Yeah, I just...

17:19.344 --> 17:20.877
I was lying. That's it.

17:20.929 --> 17:22.462
You ain't got to lie
to kick it, man.

17:22.548 --> 17:25.515
No, you don't have to cross out
your autograph. Thank you.

17:25.550 --> 17:28.300
- By the way, who's gonna date you,
dressing like that? - Good question--

17:28.387 --> 17:30.147
we've been asking that
for years. By the way,

17:30.189 --> 17:32.272
I like you guys a lot,
and I just want to say, man,

17:32.357 --> 17:34.891
- big fan, real bullish on the Cards' "D"
this season. - Right.

17:34.977 --> 17:36.977
I mean, when you got
a player like a Tyrann Mathieu

17:36.979 --> 17:38.311
and a Calais Campbell...
Hold on--

17:38.397 --> 17:39.896
player "like" us?
Come on, man,

17:39.982 --> 17:41.982
we hate that.
There's no player like me.

17:42.067 --> 17:43.400
There's just me.
Well, the ESPN always says that,

17:43.485 --> 17:45.318
I don't know.
ESPN'll get you in trouble, man.

17:45.404 --> 17:46.820
Just say Honey Badger.

17:46.905 --> 17:48.455
That's what I would
tell him, you know?

17:48.540 --> 17:50.040
Uh, you guys want to take a picture?
Ooh, yeah, uh,

17:50.075 --> 17:51.408
actually, here--
use my phone.

17:51.493 --> 17:53.243
Oh, great, I guess, I guess
I'm taking the picture.

17:53.295 --> 17:54.494
Get in here, Ruxin.

17:54.580 --> 17:55.829
You guys must love
taking pictures.

17:55.914 --> 17:57.914
Oh, looks like somebody
might have a girlfriend.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.083
Wait...
"I want a picture of the Honey Badger

18:00.135 --> 18:01.218
with my Honey Badger."
No, no, I...

18:01.253 --> 18:03.637
"Have fun at the draft,
lover. Meeg..."

18:03.722 --> 18:05.755
Meegan?

18:05.807 --> 18:07.090
I...
Wait, your girlfriend

18:07.175 --> 18:08.558
is my ex-wife?

18:08.594 --> 18:10.677
I can explain. I'm sorry.
Hey, Pete,

18:10.762 --> 18:13.480
a guy like an Andre
is sleeping with your ex-wife?

18:13.565 --> 18:14.648
Oh,

18:14.733 --> 18:16.013
a Honey Badger
don't give a shit!

18:16.018 --> 18:17.734
All right, quiet down,
Honey Badger.

18:17.769 --> 18:19.352
That's why she gave me
the conversation-ender.

18:19.438 --> 18:21.271
That's why!
All I know is that

18:21.323 --> 18:23.106
she joined a fantasy league and
she wanted some advice, right?

18:23.158 --> 18:24.441
So she gave me a call,

18:24.526 --> 18:26.359
just a normal call.
And then, all of a sudden,

18:26.445 --> 18:27.494
that turned into a coffee

18:27.579 --> 18:29.112
and then into some lovemaking.

18:29.197 --> 18:30.247
Oh, disgusting.

18:30.282 --> 18:32.032
Coitus?
Aah, more disgusting!

18:32.117 --> 18:33.450
Okay, look, I don't know what
you want me to tell you.

18:33.535 --> 18:35.001
Why did she even
come to you for advice?

18:35.087 --> 18:36.419
That's the worst part
of this whole thing.

18:36.455 --> 18:38.121
Uh, well...

18:38.173 --> 18:39.789
I am the champ.

18:39.841 --> 18:40.957
Criminy. Ooh.
That's my... key.

18:41.009 --> 18:42.759
I got to get my keys.

18:42.794 --> 18:44.628
Oh, that's it, you son of a bitch.
I know you're mad...

18:44.680 --> 18:46.129
Oh, I'm not mad,
I'm just gonna kill you.

18:46.181 --> 18:47.681
Washington has traded the pick.

18:47.766 --> 18:49.683
Seattle is on the clock.

18:49.768 --> 18:51.468
Oh, aah! Sorry, sorry.
Andre!

18:51.520 --> 18:52.886
Oh, shit.
I'm gonna kill you.

18:52.971 --> 18:54.104
Whoa, whoa.
I'm gonna kill you!

18:54.139 --> 18:56.389
Fidelio!
Fidelio!

18:56.475 --> 18:59.643
Oh!
You're dead, Andre, you're dead!

18:59.695 --> 19:02.312
I can't believe I am here...
I am here, I'm doing this

19:02.397 --> 19:04.064
with you. I am
with Jim McMahon

19:04.149 --> 19:05.148
at the dr...
Just call me Jim.

19:05.200 --> 19:06.533
Really?
Okay, Jim.

19:06.618 --> 19:08.818
And I am not with
any of my stupid friends.

19:08.904 --> 19:11.821
Hey, man, you okay?
He's out.

19:14.710 --> 19:16.159
What do I...

19:17.329 --> 19:18.628
Hello?

19:18.664 --> 19:19.663
Fermy.
Uh,

19:19.715 --> 19:20.675
this is Kevin MacArthur.

19:20.749 --> 19:21.998
Kevin...

19:22.050 --> 19:23.667
Do we have a Kevin?
No Kevin.

19:23.719 --> 19:25.335
Hey, Kevin,

19:25.387 --> 19:26.803
this is John Schneider,
I'm the general manager

19:26.838 --> 19:28.088
of the Seattle Seahawks.

19:28.173 --> 19:29.589
Look, we're gonna
make a trade here, okay?

19:29.675 --> 19:31.675
Oh, a trade? Oh, I'm the man
for the job, Mr. Schneider.

19:31.727 --> 19:33.677
Um, I'm the commissioner
of my league,

19:33.762 --> 19:35.145
so this is like
a dream come true for me.

19:35.180 --> 19:36.479
Quite the opposite
for me, partner.

19:36.515 --> 19:37.681
Don't worry, I know my stuff.

19:37.766 --> 19:39.065
He doesn't.
Who we picking?

19:39.151 --> 19:41.351
We're picking Tyler Lockett
from Kansas State.

19:41.436 --> 19:42.686
Taylor Lockett, okay.
Taylor Lockett. Taylor Lockett?

19:42.738 --> 19:44.270
No, what do you think,
Taylor Lautner?

19:44.356 --> 19:45.438
What are you, Team Jacob?
What?

19:45.524 --> 19:47.691
<i>Tyler</i> Lockett, Kansas State.

19:47.776 --> 19:50.026
Do you see trade cards?
There's a trade card for

19:50.112 --> 19:51.861
Jacksonville,
a trade card for Indy...

19:51.913 --> 19:53.196
Do you see one with Washington?

19:53.248 --> 19:54.414
Whoa... Uh, uh,
I'm sorry,

19:54.499 --> 19:55.782
some of these cards
have a little bit

19:55.867 --> 19:57.367
of ketchup on them.
Are you eating right now?

19:57.419 --> 19:59.202
Yes. I get hungry
when I'm nervous.

19:59.254 --> 20:00.787
It's actually
my slider, Schneider.

20:00.872 --> 20:02.288
No, it's not, we
picked it out together.

20:02.374 --> 20:04.874
Man, you fantasy guys. You all
think you can run your own team

20:04.926 --> 20:07.344
and then it gets to nut-cuttin'
time and you just fall apart.

20:07.379 --> 20:09.512
Every time I'm on the clock
I just shit the bed.

20:09.548 --> 20:11.514
Last year in the first round
I took Doug Martin.

20:11.550 --> 20:12.849
Yeah.
And you know how that ended up.

20:12.884 --> 20:14.634
It was real message board
fodder, Schneider.

20:14.720 --> 20:15.769
Hey, Kevin, come on,
the clock's ticking.

20:15.854 --> 20:17.134
I need you
to fill that thing out

20:17.139 --> 20:19.439
and turn that card in, okay?
Right, yes, okay,

20:19.524 --> 20:20.690
- um...
- One minute on the clock for Seattle.

20:20.726 --> 20:22.559
Schneids.
Tyrannosaurus Rux here.

20:22.611 --> 20:24.110
Tyrannosaurus what?
I just want you to know that I've got

20:24.196 --> 20:26.730
ESPN Insider up and running.

20:26.782 --> 20:29.399
Mel Kiper's hair is gonna
tell us who to help you.

20:29.451 --> 20:30.731
We don't care about his hair.
Go.

20:30.736 --> 20:32.235
Give me this.
Okay,

20:32.287 --> 20:34.237
Mr. Schneider, I got the
card. Uh, do I sign it?

20:34.289 --> 20:35.572
No, you don't sign it.

20:35.657 --> 20:36.873
Can I sign it?
No.

20:36.908 --> 20:38.509
Can I take a selfie with it?
No, just go.

20:38.543 --> 20:41.077
Kevin, come on.
The clock's ticking. Kevin, go.

20:41.129 --> 20:42.412
- Okay, okay, I'm going. Good-bye!
- 15 seconds on the clock.

20:42.464 --> 20:44.497
Okay, I don't have
time for this.

20:44.583 --> 20:46.132
Oh!

20:46.218 --> 20:47.801
Uh, I... Ooh, sorry.

20:47.886 --> 20:50.503
Here!

20:50.589 --> 20:51.671
Is the trade in?
Trade's in.

20:51.757 --> 20:53.089
Card in?
Card's in.

20:53.175 --> 20:56.226
I need a nap.

20:56.261 --> 20:58.178
So what's the story
with the coffee scene

20:58.263 --> 20:59.512
in Seattle?
Is it beat

20:59.598 --> 21:00.847
or is it still popping off?

21:01.983 --> 21:03.400
Slapdicks.

21:04.640 --> 21:05.672
Chicago has made their pick.

21:05.758 --> 21:08.058
Thank you.

21:08.093 --> 21:09.927
All right, Jenny,
it's game time.

21:10.012 --> 21:12.513
You ready?
I was born ready.

21:12.598 --> 21:14.598
Let's do this.
Oh, my God.

21:14.683 --> 21:17.351
I got it in.
Look, with Seattle,

21:17.436 --> 21:19.152
it's proof you got to run it in.
Okay, all right, enough.

21:19.238 --> 21:20.854
Don't move.
Stay here.

21:20.940 --> 21:22.606
Get away from me.
What did I miss?

21:22.658 --> 21:24.525
Jets just picked,
Chicago's on the clock.

21:24.610 --> 21:25.993
Jenny's about
to announce the pick.

21:26.078 --> 21:27.744
Well, don't be so sure.

21:27.780 --> 21:30.080
I might have told Taco there's
one more Sacko punishment.

21:30.115 --> 21:31.498
Hello, Chicago,

21:31.584 --> 21:33.450
it's great to be home.

21:33.536 --> 21:36.203
And here to announce
Chicago's next pick,

21:36.288 --> 21:39.172
please welcome Ms. Jenny MacArthur.

21:42.678 --> 21:45.462
Hi, Ellie, hi, CB,
Mommy loves you!

21:45.514 --> 21:49.266
Okay, the 71st pick of the 2015

21:49.301 --> 21:51.101
draft, the Chicago Bears
Oh, wow.

21:51.136 --> 21:52.269
would like to select...
Ha, ha, ha!

21:52.304 --> 21:53.804
No, Taco!
I got it.

21:53.889 --> 21:55.806
My card, my punishment.
Hey, give me that!

21:55.891 --> 21:57.808
Happy birthday, Kevin.
Thank you.

21:57.893 --> 21:59.977
This is great...
Don't touch me.

22:00.062 --> 22:01.612
Give me that...Give me that!
Ow, ow!

22:01.647 --> 22:04.147
Hey, ain't those
the people from earlier?

22:04.199 --> 22:05.449
Yeah, man, they got to be
the dumbest people

22:05.484 --> 22:06.700
in all of Chicago, man.

22:06.785 --> 22:08.285
Give me...
It's mine, it's mine!

22:08.320 --> 22:09.369
What the hell?

22:09.455 --> 22:11.154
This is the weirdest draft ever.

22:11.240 --> 22:12.289
Give it to me.

22:12.324 --> 22:13.624
That is my pick!
Whoa!

22:13.659 --> 22:15.459
Oh! Whoa!
Ooh!

22:15.494 --> 22:17.244
Yes, I got it!

22:17.329 --> 22:18.996
Jim, Jim, Jim!
Oh...

22:19.081 --> 22:21.131

22:21.166 --> 22:22.666
Oh!
Okay,

22:22.718 --> 22:24.635
with the 71st pick,
the Bears select

22:24.670 --> 22:28.088
the center from Oregon,
Hroniss Grasu.

22:29.341 --> 22:31.675
Baby, baby, you okay?
How did I do?

22:31.727 --> 22:33.844
You're out of here!
Yay, whee!

22:33.896 --> 22:37.180
You're in a lot of trouble.
Ooh, another punishment?

22:37.266 --> 22:38.231
Is this the butt stuff?

22:38.317 --> 22:40.690
