00:57.620 --> 01:03.100
Quinn, Jack. Your final assignment
is classification red.

01:03.260 --> 01:08.740
At 3:05 a truck with 32 kg. of
non-active plutonium was stolen -

01:08.900 --> 01:13.660
- from an American installation
outside Croatia.

01:13.820 --> 01:19.660
Stavros and his organization will
sell it to Iraq within 24 hours.

01:19.860 --> 01:24.780
Your objective is the safe return
of the plutonium to our base.

01:30.460 --> 01:33.500
Out of the way!

01:33.660 --> 01:37.020
Quinn's in! The XRT is mobile.

01:37.180 --> 01:40.860
Quinn has 14 hours
to reach the border.

01:41.060 --> 01:45.140
If he does make it,
his resignation is final.

04:20.779 --> 04:24.060
Jack, would you get that?

04:26.380 --> 04:31.540
Kathryn!
Your damn cow is in my way!

04:31.700 --> 04:37.180
- It's not a cow, it's a swan.
- Whatever it is, it's in my way.

04:37.340 --> 04:40.500
In your way?

04:43.020 --> 04:48.580
- The swan is beautiful. So are you.
- Not for long.

04:54.260 --> 04:59.580
You'll still be sexy.
A bit rounder, and a bit softer...

04:59.740 --> 05:05.740
- The baby, isn't it what we want?
- Of course.

05:09.100 --> 05:12.460
Bonjour, Jack.

05:14.220 --> 05:19.060
- You don't believe in front doors.
- You know all about back doors.

05:25.900 --> 05:29.660
- How did you find me?
- We never lost you.

05:29.860 --> 05:36.300
- Then you know I'm retired.
- How long can you watch the sunset?

05:36.460 --> 05:39.700
You're a hunter. You miss the game.

05:39.860 --> 05:45.580
You don't get it. For me, it's
personal. For you, it's politics.

05:45.740 --> 05:51.660
Politics makes money, opportunity.
Everything's politics.

05:51.820 --> 05:55.260
You want personal? Okay...

05:55.420 --> 06:00.820
Stavros is back.
We want him alive.

06:02.460 --> 06:07.660
We want all his nasty information.
Names, escape routes. We need you.

06:07.820 --> 06:12.260
You're the only guy who knows
how he works.

06:12.420 --> 06:18.740
Come on. It's your last shot.
A Delta team is waiting in Antwerp.

06:18.900 --> 06:23.660
Face it, Jack.
You can't retire until he does.

06:29.980 --> 06:36.660
- Is Quinn coming back or not?
- If he's not, we go to plan B.

06:40.780 --> 06:45.940
Move the seat up.
It's a little tight in the rear.

06:46.100 --> 06:49.860
That's generally true of the CIA.

06:53.060 --> 06:58.980
You bust drug cartels in Third World
countries and testify for Congress.

06:59.180 --> 07:05.260
They make you a deputy director,
but you're just a minor leaguer.

07:05.420 --> 07:11.740
You were only good for getting
Quinn back. It'll be challenging.

07:15.180 --> 07:19.580
I left you a present.

07:22.780 --> 07:26.620
Get me out! Help!

08:03.540 --> 08:06.100
Don't tell me it's not dangerous.

08:07.060 --> 08:11.380
That you're going to be back
in 36 hours.

08:40.179 --> 08:43.020
I'm looking for Yaz.

08:48.380 --> 08:51.380
I'm looking for Yaz.

08:53.940 --> 08:57.220
I bet that hurt.

08:57.700 --> 09:03.620
That hurt. These hurt.
But I like this one right here.

09:03.820 --> 09:07.500
- Who are you?
- I'm the man.

09:07.660 --> 09:12.900
Do you judge a person
by the way he looks? I hate that.

09:13.060 --> 09:15.580
Who does your hair,
Siegfried or Roy?

09:15.740 --> 09:20.900
The last who mocked my hair is still
pulling his head out of his ass.

09:21.060 --> 09:24.980
I don't want to know
about your sex life.

09:25.140 --> 09:30.980
- This has been fun. Who are you?
- Jack Quinn.

09:31.140 --> 09:35.180
If you want to dance,
ask me nicely.

09:36.020 --> 09:39.980
I just want to make sure it's you.

09:40.620 --> 09:47.340
The legend walks. I heard
you dropped out of the game.

10:01.380 --> 10:05.980
Santa's workshop!
Who's that, Rudolph?

10:06.180 --> 10:12.340
- I have the best elves around.
- Christmas shopping for bad boys?

10:12.500 --> 10:17.100
I don't play with the bad boys
any more, only the good guys.

10:17.300 --> 10:22.980
What do you need? I got shit here
so new, I don't know I have it.

10:26.860 --> 10:30.620
- Offence gets the glory.
- But defence wins the game.

10:30.820 --> 10:37.500
I take cash, gold...
Did you open that?

10:38.100 --> 10:40.900
Fire in the hole!

10:43.380 --> 10:50.300
But no cheques. And my rule is:
You break it, you bought it.

11:02.500 --> 11:08.220
Gentlemen, this is Delta 1.
Forget you ever saw him.

11:11.460 --> 11:18.540
Mr. Yamir here says Stavros will
surface tomorrow... close to here.

11:19.980 --> 11:22.740
An amusement park...

11:24.540 --> 11:29.060
- Who's my dead-eye?
- Me, sir.

11:33.100 --> 11:36.980
Do you know how to use it?

11:37.140 --> 11:43.380
It's rigged for tranquilizer darts.
Can you hit a man at 200 yards?

11:43.540 --> 11:46.900
I can shoot
the dick off a hummingbird.

11:47.060 --> 11:52.340
He's like a snake. Look in his eyes,
he'll get you in the back.

11:53.340 --> 11:57.940
When we ID Stavros, move into
position. We only have one shot.

11:58.140 --> 12:03.860
Two darts will kill a man.
Three, a rhino. We want him alive.

12:32.060 --> 12:36.660
Delta 5, check the two women
by the carousel.

13:00.220 --> 13:06.220
- Something's happening.
- We have Stavros. Grey Mercedes.

13:06.420 --> 13:11.700
- We've got three men moving.
- Let them in.

13:11.860 --> 13:16.140
2 and 5, move to Baker.
Others, hold.

13:23.700 --> 13:26.700
This is way too easy.

13:29.260 --> 13:33.300
He's in my sight.
Ready to fire.

13:35.060 --> 13:38.260
That's not Stavros!

13:38.420 --> 13:42.940
Stavros is a lefty!
It's not him!

13:43.100 --> 13:47.620
- Find the driver!
- En route to ground positions.

13:54.260 --> 13:59.820
- We're securing the exits.
- I got him.

14:00.380 --> 14:05.780
The woman's hiding something.
It could be a bomb.

14:05.940 --> 14:09.380
My God...

14:12.940 --> 14:17.460
- I'm locked on.
- 2 and 5 in position.

14:17.620 --> 14:22.460
Ready to take him.
Why are we waiting, Delta 1?

14:23.780 --> 14:26.420
Ready to move in.

14:27.340 --> 14:33.020
- I'm waiting for your command.
- What are you waiting for?

14:49.460 --> 14:53.060
- Clear out!
- Too late, clown boy.

15:04.980 --> 15:07.260
Move to position 3.

19:00.740 --> 19:05.860
His mother told me that his
favourite thing in the world -

19:06.020 --> 19:11.420
- was riding his little pony
on the weekends.

19:12.380 --> 19:16.140
He loved riding that pony.

19:18.780 --> 19:24.100
That little horse
is going to miss my boy.

19:25.980 --> 19:32.660
I'm a professional, Quinn.
I've killed. I've killed a lot.

19:33.660 --> 19:37.500
But most of the bastards I killed
deserved to die.

19:37.660 --> 19:44.620
My little boy was six years old.

19:46.060 --> 19:49.820
Now that makes it personal, mister.

21:47.180 --> 21:50.100
Candidate for Colony residency:

21:50.260 --> 21:54.860
Quinn, Jack Paul. Born 1959.

21:55.020 --> 21:58.180
Entered Foreign Service at 22.

21:58.340 --> 22:03.940
Trained in demolition, tracking,
psychological countermeasures.

22:04.100 --> 22:07.340
Specialty: Anti-terrorism.

22:07.500 --> 22:11.380
Last assignment:
Stavros acquisition.

22:11.540 --> 22:16.740
Video segment A- 19.
Antwerp interdiction.

22:16.900 --> 22:22.740
Quinn achieved clear opportunity
to acquire Alpha, but Alpha escaped.

22:22.900 --> 22:29.380
You went soft. But your skills
got you assigned to the Colony.

22:29.540 --> 22:34.300
- No!
- You do have an alternative.

22:34.500 --> 22:41.180
Nerve gas is painless and effective.
But you are already dead.

22:41.340 --> 22:49.300
That's what your wife thinks. If you
wish to live, scan your thumbprint.

22:50.340 --> 22:54.900
10, 9, 8, 7, 6,...

22:55.060 --> 22:58.500
...5, 4, 3, 2...

23:05.420 --> 23:09.260
Identity confirmed.
Thank you, Mr. Quinn.

23:09.420 --> 23:13.380
Now, was that so bad?

23:28.580 --> 23:33.180
Jack, glad you decided to join us.

23:33.340 --> 23:36.700
- Alex Goldsmythe.
- The Tax Man.

23:36.860 --> 23:42.860
- You were killed six years ago.
- It's been six years already?

23:45.980 --> 23:49.260
Climb on.
Some friends want to meet you.

23:50.020 --> 23:55.380
Gentlemen,
come and meet the famed Jack Quinn.

24:00.740 --> 24:05.260
- Moishe Levant, died in Lebanon.
- Beirut.

24:05.420 --> 24:12.980
- Everybody... all ex-agents.
- Or ex-enemies.

24:13.140 --> 24:17.380
We're too valuable to kill
and too dangerous to set free.

24:17.540 --> 24:20.700
Welcome to the Colony.

24:21.700 --> 24:25.820
- Quinn.
- Staal.

24:26.820 --> 24:30.100
I understand.

24:40.180 --> 24:44.860
This violence is not approved.

24:47.100 --> 24:52.100
- I killed him in Tuzla.
- Apparently not well enough.

24:52.260 --> 24:55.180
I really dislike that man.

24:55.340 --> 25:01.500
You must wear this at all times.
It's part pager, part timer.

25:01.660 --> 25:06.100
It tells you where to be.
When it signals, you must respond.

25:11.940 --> 25:17.420
We're a think-tank. We're linked
to every law enforcement database.

25:17.580 --> 25:22.660
We analyse terrorist incidents
and advise our client governments.

25:22.820 --> 25:26.740
We're the last line of defence
against global terrorism, -

25:26.900 --> 25:32.500
- and no one knows we exist.
What's on the menu for today?

25:37.660 --> 25:44.300
A Global Air 747 en route
from San Francisco to Seoul.

25:45.340 --> 25:49.740
We are interpreting signals
from the crash site.

25:57.180 --> 26:01.780
Headset on.
Hand on the scanner at all times.

26:11.140 --> 26:15.620
We have a feed coming in
from Washington.

26:17.940 --> 26:24.780
I have a statement from the
Secretary on the Global Air tragedy.

26:24.940 --> 26:29.460
Of the 176 passengers on board,
there are no survivors.

26:29.620 --> 26:35.180
The CIA reports that the plane was
deliberately downed by North Korea.

26:35.340 --> 26:41.260
The Secretary will brief you later
regarding the U. S. response.

26:41.420 --> 26:47.180
The Koreans deny responsibility, and
the President consults his allies.

26:51.620 --> 26:59.020
Jack, your worth is in your ability
to analyse data in times of crisis.

26:59.180 --> 27:03.740
This is the Colony's
reason to exist.

27:05.300 --> 27:10.700
The plane exploded from
internal malfunction. It's gone.

27:11.620 --> 27:18.500
We've intercepted the transmission
of Global 277's voice recorder.

27:18.660 --> 27:22.900
We've got unscheduled traffic
at heading 329...

27:24.980 --> 27:30.740
It's not a pleasant prospect,
the Koreans having that technology.

27:30.900 --> 27:35.900
Anyone with an alternative?
Anyone?

27:38.220 --> 27:42.980
Analysis confirms the report.
Moishe, do you buy it?

27:43.980 --> 27:47.180
I'm not sure.

27:49.460 --> 27:54.140
He's lying.
He's covering something up.

27:54.300 --> 27:58.980
- They know something about it.
- Let's examine the images.

28:02.220 --> 28:05.500
- Hold it.
- It's a shadow.

28:05.660 --> 28:10.420
- Bingo. An AWACS.
- No, an F-4 Weasel.

28:10.620 --> 28:17.340
- Include it in the simulation.
- It could've been hidden.

28:17.500 --> 28:22.660
The Koreans pick up the F-4 on radar
but shoot down the passenger jet.

28:22.820 --> 28:28.220
The U.S. used the jumbo as cover
for data recon on a weapons test.

28:29.140 --> 28:34.700
They were set up so the Americans
could eavesdrop on a military base.

28:34.860 --> 28:38.060
Nice call, Jack.

28:47.620 --> 28:51.300
Underwater lasers.

28:51.500 --> 28:56.500
One metre below the surface.
They destroy anything they contact.

28:56.660 --> 29:00.340
If they don't get you,
the undertow will.

29:00.500 --> 29:05.700
- No one ever escaped?
- No one.

29:05.860 --> 29:11.220
A certain Bryce was the last to try.
Before the lasers were installed.

29:11.380 --> 29:16.740
Poor fellow didn't survive 48 hours.
His "guardian" took care of him.

29:16.900 --> 29:21.420
Each resident has a guardian,
without knowing who it is.

29:21.580 --> 29:27.660
The guardian observes the resident's
attitude, behaviour and production.

29:27.860 --> 29:31.900
If the resident escapes,
the guardian terminates him.

29:32.060 --> 29:39.700
- How have you hidden this place?
- A masking device. We're invisible.

30:11.860 --> 30:15.980
- Hello, Kathryn?
- Hello?

30:16.140 --> 30:22.140
- I hope I'm not disturbing you.
- No...

30:22.340 --> 30:27.180
This is Maria Trifioli
from the Galleria Luna in Rome.

30:27.380 --> 30:35.420
We'd like to arrange an exhibition
of your sculptures. Surprised?

30:35.580 --> 30:40.020
I'll send you a plane ticket
in the morning.

30:50.060 --> 30:55.180
You have five minutes
to check in at your cottages.

31:07.340 --> 31:13.020
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2...

31:16.020 --> 31:19.900
Thank you, Mr. Quinn.
Please remain in contact.

31:43.820 --> 31:47.340
The lasers are disengaged.

33:06.700 --> 33:13.420
Hi, I'm Maria Trifioli.
I'm glad you accepted our offer.

33:13.580 --> 33:18.340
I'm very flattered.
But it would be so difficult...

33:18.500 --> 33:25.060
- You don't want to show your work?
- It's only four months since...

33:25.220 --> 33:29.900
Perhaps this will open a new chapter
in your life.

33:30.100 --> 33:35.220
The problem is moving to Rome.
It's so expensive...

33:35.380 --> 33:42.300
Stay with us at the Regina. I'll see
that you and the baby are cared for.

33:43.900 --> 33:49.580
Later you'll meet the gallery owner.
He's been waiting to meet you.

35:40.660 --> 35:48.060
It's a typical Stavros operation,
and confirms our intelligence.

35:48.260 --> 35:56.460
But who is paying for his talents?
We anxiously await your analysis.

35:58.220 --> 36:02.500
What's unusual, is that
no one's claimed responsibility.

36:02.660 --> 36:08.140
Location: Barcelona. The Algerians
have flexed their muscles there.

36:08.300 --> 36:13.140
They can't afford Stavros.
Maybe it's personal vengeance.

36:13.300 --> 36:18.620
- Maybe Stavros is working alone.
- Why would he?

36:18.780 --> 36:23.540
- Suppose it was a random act?
- Many groups are active in Spain.

36:29.060 --> 36:33.740
- What do you think, Jack?
- No.

36:35.780 --> 36:39.300
We await your comment.

36:42.300 --> 36:47.420
It's not Stavros.
It's a copycat.

36:58.220 --> 37:04.140
I also failed to get Stavros.
He's my last unpaid debt.

37:04.340 --> 37:07.300
He's free, and I'm stuck here.

37:08.300 --> 37:14.380
You were our last hope,
the last one good enough to get him.

37:16.540 --> 37:22.020
- Does he know about this place?
- Maybe. That's why he's dangerous.

37:22.180 --> 37:27.620
Agencies around the world
used him for difficult work.

37:27.780 --> 37:31.740
When he was our ally, he was heroic.

37:31.900 --> 37:37.100
Now he works for someone else, he's
a scalawag. He's out of fashion.

37:37.260 --> 37:45.060
We've had to part with your swan.
I doubled the price.

37:47.100 --> 37:52.300
My husband loved that swan.
He thought it was a cow.

40:38.220 --> 40:42.540
You have five minutes
to check in at your cottages.

41:07.220 --> 41:11.060
5, 4, 3, 2...

41:12.020 --> 41:14.820
Thank you, Mr. Quinn.

41:57.620 --> 42:01.060
- Let's go!
- The lasers are down!

43:36.740 --> 43:43.980
I need help with the cable.
Give me some slack. Pull!

44:21.100 --> 44:24.460
- Got a parachute?
- Yes!

45:01.460 --> 45:05.980
Fasten your seat belts.
We'll be landing soon.

45:10.500 --> 45:13.700
Who is his guardian?

45:38.940 --> 45:44.460
- Boo!
- I heard they made you disappear.

45:44.620 --> 45:49.540
- I need merchandise.
- Sorry, I'm closed for the night.

45:53.260 --> 45:56.620
You're open now.

46:03.940 --> 46:05.940
Let's talk.

46:06.100 --> 46:13.500
- I need some mean toys.
- You'll be the bad boy in the hood.

46:13.700 --> 46:21.980
Check this out. Laser sight.
Automatic. You'll need a holster.

46:23.020 --> 46:26.220
- These are nice...
- Can you fly a plane?

46:26.380 --> 46:33.700
Like a bird. But I stay on the
ground... Gas grenades are on sale.

46:36.180 --> 46:41.900
You paying cash..? I just declared
a seven-day cooling-off period.

46:42.060 --> 46:48.140
- You know I'm good for it.
- Dead men don't get credit.

46:51.260 --> 46:57.940
You get three CIA account numbers.
I get the stuff, you get the codes.

46:58.900 --> 47:03.420
When I look at you,
I see nothing but trouble...

47:06.180 --> 47:09.860
What the hell...
I like trouble.

47:12.540 --> 47:17.380
- A parachute?
- This is better than a parachute.

47:18.060 --> 47:25.140
- Are you sure this works?
- Of course.

47:25.300 --> 47:30.140
I'm positive it works.

47:30.340 --> 47:34.900
If you die, you get a full refund.

47:36.700 --> 47:40.140
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

47:41.100 --> 47:44.180
What are you doing?

47:58.980 --> 48:02.980
- Give me a hand.
- How about a foot?

48:04.860 --> 48:08.620
- Let's try something else.
- That's love, baby.

48:08.780 --> 48:11.540
Watch your hands.

48:11.700 --> 48:15.060
That's what I call hang time.

48:21.060 --> 48:26.740
What's wrong with you?
You're crazier than my hairstylist!

48:26.900 --> 48:32.380
- Did you test it?
- I didn't need to, I built it!

48:32.540 --> 48:37.220
- Maybe I'll give you the codes.
- What do you mean "maybe"?

48:38.500 --> 48:41.420
- Trust me.
- Bite me!

49:25.780 --> 49:29.620
Yes, Kathryn. I'm coming.

51:22.500 --> 51:26.020
Your baby's due tomorrow.

51:26.180 --> 51:33.020
That's his heartbeat. Don't be late.
I wouldn't take this car.

51:33.180 --> 51:39.580
I'm glad to see you can still play.
Check in to Hotel Navona in Rome.

51:39.740 --> 51:42.900
Your baby's due tomorrow.

51:43.060 --> 51:49.700
That's his heartbeat. Don't be late.
I wouldn't take this car.

51:49.860 --> 51:56.100
I'm glad to see you can still play.
Check in to Hotel Navona in Rome.

51:56.260 --> 51:59.620
Your baby's due tomorrow.

51:59.820 --> 52:03.820
That's his heartbeat...

52:08.220 --> 52:11.460
Don't spoil the paint job.

52:13.260 --> 52:14.820
Thanks.

52:14.980 --> 52:21.220
I'm protecting my investment. But
this is too much. I want the codes.

52:22.460 --> 52:28.700
- I need transportation to Rome.
- Transportation, you say?

52:28.860 --> 52:32.060
I have some connections around here.

52:50.100 --> 52:55.900
If they can make it, I can steal it.
We'll blend in, in this.

52:56.060 --> 53:00.380
So that's why you're dressed
like a carrot with earrings.

53:00.540 --> 53:04.460
Damn bicycles.
Get out of the way!

53:04.620 --> 53:08.700
I have them. They're on
the autostrada to Rome.

53:08.860 --> 53:13.020
That checks with our information.
Quin's wife is at the Regina.

53:13.180 --> 53:16.300
Splendid!
We've got a game going.

53:41.300 --> 53:45.780
- Anything for Jack Quinn?
- Si, signore. Right here.

53:52.220 --> 53:55.380
This was waiting for you, Quinn.

53:58.260 --> 54:03.260
It's not a bomb.
Maybe it's the access codes.

54:03.420 --> 54:08.500
- I'd love to get paid.
- Those accounts are fronts. Empty.

54:10.540 --> 54:16.140
That figures. Why are you lying?
I bet the Colony doesn't even exist!

54:17.100 --> 54:21.940
- It's not about the Colony.
- What the hell is this?

54:22.140 --> 54:27.340
A sonogram of my son.
Stavros has my boy.

54:27.500 --> 54:32.580
You go back to Antwerp.
I'll get your money. I pay my debts.

54:35.220 --> 54:39.100
Quinn. Keep your money.

54:43.980 --> 54:50.420
- Why didn't you tell me before?
- What for? You always play defence.

54:52.460 --> 54:59.020
It's time to get off the bench.
The best defence is offence, right?

54:59.180 --> 55:02.100
Right.

55:06.340 --> 55:10.700
If we play by Stavros' rules,
my wife and son are dead.

55:10.860 --> 55:15.460
If you send that e-mail, it'll be
intercepted by all the agencies.

55:15.660 --> 55:20.420
- What's the plan?
- None. But Stavros doesn't know.

55:20.620 --> 55:28.180
So he'll do what he thinks I would
do, and lead us right to Kathryn.

55:37.860 --> 55:41.780
Quinn's clever.
A very sensitive man.

55:42.580 --> 55:47.580
Another time, another place...
It's just too late.

55:56.620 --> 55:59.980
You're going to hospital.
You'll be safer there.

56:14.380 --> 56:17.060
Here, sir. Look.

56:22.860 --> 56:25.820
It's a circus.
Everybody's here.

56:25.980 --> 56:31.500
There's the Mossad.
Some local boys, on the corner.

56:32.980 --> 56:38.100
Even the carabinieri.
Holy cow, it's a full house!

56:40.340 --> 56:44.300
- Pardon me!
- Keep moving, buddy!

56:50.940 --> 56:57.620
- It seems your plan isn't working.
- Patience. He'll be here.

56:57.780 --> 57:01.900
- If we need help, I have a brother.
- You have a brother?

57:02.060 --> 57:04.740
Yes. In the Sancumini Chapel.

57:34.340 --> 57:37.940
Quinn, no!
That's what he wants.

57:38.140 --> 57:42.700
Kathryn!

57:48.180 --> 57:50.820
No!

58:02.940 --> 58:07.700
You know something, Jack?
I never break a promise.

58:13.620 --> 58:18.140
I promise I'll send you
an invitation to the christening.

58:20.340 --> 58:26.020
- Think about wearing black.
- Let my wife go. Take me.

58:26.180 --> 58:29.540
Actually,
I'm gonna take all three of you.

58:33.780 --> 58:37.820
I got Stavros and Quinn!

59:03.020 --> 59:06.220
Sniper on the roof!

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:18.540
- You're out of the game.
- You sure?

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:44.700
He's up...
He's in!

01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:49.180
That was a five-pointer.

01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:42.700
- Where is my wife?
- What are you talking about?

01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:38.420
- Where's Jack?
- Don't worry, it'll be fine.

01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:42.620
Who are you people?

01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:09.140
Jack's coming. Take care of it.
He mustn't know what day it is.

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:30.020
Buonasera, Friar.
I'm looking for a guy named...

01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:48.020
- What are these walls?
- The bones of my brothers.

01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:53.380
You are a friend of Brother Yaz.
He has done us many favours.

01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:58.140
Including a mainframe
you wouldn't believe.

01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:09.460
- What's up?
- What's up?

01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:16.420
This is Brother Regulo and Brother
Ramulo. This is Brother Quinn.

01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:28.900
The monks have gathered information
on Rome for 500 years. Cybermonks!

01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:33.180
That prescription label you found?
He's tracing it.

01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:45.340
Internet...

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:50.620
27 doctors prescribed that
medication in the last few days.

01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:56.620
- It's an outside signal.
- Is it going to crash?

01:06:56.780 --> 01:07:01.260
Where in heaven did that come from?

01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:15.260
May I?

01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:21.260
Incoming message.

01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:25.500
"Thanks for the blessing. Jack. "

01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:37.980
He's down here somewhere.

01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:44.700
Man, these antiques
are worth a fortune!

01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:49.140
In a spiritual sense.

01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:55.220
We are now under the Tiber River,
going towards the Island of Tiberi.

01:07:55.380 --> 01:08:00.860
- Under the bridge to the hospital.
- That's where Stavros' men will be?

01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:08.540
- Good luck!
- Thank you, brothers.

01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:12.060
- Catch you on the Internet!
- I'll wait for your e-mail.

01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:19.580
Okay, push!
Like that! Push!

01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:25.540
- It's stuck! But I have something.
- What do you have?

01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:35.220
- What's that?
- My lucky coin, my lucky detonator.

01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:42.300
- Semtex.
- That's it. Handier than duck tape.

01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:47.140
Preparation, my friend!
You've got to have the right tools.

01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:53.740
- Damn, not enough wire!
- Preparation, huh?

01:08:53.899 --> 01:08:56.500
Hold on.

01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:00.100
Let's find a rock.

01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:06.500
You don't mind, do you?
It's for a good cause.

01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:13.819
- Oops, airball!
- You need practice, man.

01:09:13.979 --> 01:09:17.939
I hate practice.
But I never miss twice, brother.

01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:35.460
My baby!

01:09:55.860 --> 01:10:01.020
- He's on the island.
- Of course he is.

01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:06.740
I need time. Give me 60 seconds.
Then kill both the women.

01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:17.580
Up there.

01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:25.820
Go, go, go!

01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:31.180
Be careful.
You'll wind up in the hospital.

01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:38.420
Did you hear something?
Up there!

01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:40.140
- It's me! It's me.
- It's you, it's you.

01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:49.220
This hospital is awfully quiet.

01:11:57.780 --> 01:12:01.380
You take care of it.

01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:06.740
They're over here...
Go!

01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:10.860
What are you doing just standing..?

01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:14.540
It's a hospital.
No running, please.

01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:24.860
Quiet.

01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:32.700
Let me help you down.

01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:05.660
Jack?

01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:14.340
What's going on?

01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:21.780
No, Jack. She saved me.

01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:37.220
- They said you were dead.
- It's okay. I'm here.

01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:45.460
Stavros... Where is he?

01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:52.420
Where's our son?

01:13:57.660 --> 01:14:03.180
- Where's my son?
- I know where they are.

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:09.220
You go get your boy.
I'll take care of her.

01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:14.140
- Thank you.
- You owe me.

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:54.420
Get rid of it, or the party's over.

01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:05.620
You know, Jack...
I can call you Jack, can't I?

01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:12.460
I bet there's not a night you can
close your eyes tight enough, -

01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:17.220
- without seeing
my little boy's face.

01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:20.740
I'll give you a chance
to save your son.

01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:26.420
If you live,
you'll get to know your son.

01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:32.100
And if you don't,
I'll raise him as my own.

01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:38.580
Men are strong, Jack.
But the tiger is stronger.

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:47.620
Watch your step, Jack.

01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:53.140
It's okay to step on a mine,
it's stepping off that counts.

01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:15.860
Quinn!

01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:20.260
Where did he come from?

01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:25.060
Yaz!
The crosses, they're mines.

01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:35.300
Don't go off and party without me.
I'll be back.

01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:03.180
Got you!

01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:01.820
Jack!

01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:12.180
The baby's safe.
Let's get the hell out.

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:16.780
You take care of my son.
I'll take care of Stavros.

01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:52.140
Lift your foot, my tall friend, and
that mine'll turn you to red paint.

01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:46.660
You've got big feet, Mr. Quinn.
Be careful where you put them.

01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:10.860
Looks like you're the bitch now,
Stavros. I forgot to tell you...

01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:16.860
You went to a lot of trouble
digging holes, putting up markers.

01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:23.100
But I moved a couple of crosses.
Sorry!

01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:27.380
Yaz, behind you!

01:22:39.860 --> 01:22:45.540
- Where's my son?
- I'm looking! He was right here.

01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:49.500
Is everybody okay?

01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:04.620
It's me... Daddy.

01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:31.660
I want to remember
my Roman holiday.

01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:37.580
Give me a souvenir.

01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:43.260
Cut a piece of your hair.
And your shirt.

01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:54.300
Quinn, you may like this.
A souvenir from me.

01:24:55.900 --> 01:25:00.180
Maybe my coin will
be lucky for you, too.

01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:17.700
I'm not giving you any of
my hair, Mr. Goldsmythe.

01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:22.340
You are a magician, Mr. Yaz.

01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:31.180
Now it's my turn to disappear.

01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:44.500
They'll blame me for this.
I wonder what the fine will be?
