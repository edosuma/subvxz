You know you look so good

02:41.619 --> 02:42.787
Look so good

02:42.871 --> 02:45.040
Hey, man.
Have you seen my phone?

02:45.123 --> 02:47.125
No, I don't know.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.253
Like I knew you would

02:50.545 --> 02:52.839
You know you twist, little girl

02:52.922 --> 02:54.132
Twist, little girl

03:03.850 --> 03:05.477
New data?

03:06.311 --> 03:07.937
No, same.

03:15.695 --> 03:18.073
You're too late, Veer, I'm finished.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.158
This week, it's your turn.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.777
Hey, Clark. Are you okay?

04:00.365 --> 04:02.575
She's awake.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.699
Yo! Delivery!

04:45.243 --> 04:46.870

04:52.292 --> 04:55.295
Guys, come on! Goodies are here!

04:57.213 --> 04:59.215
Nobody ever helps me around here.

05:03.636 --> 05:06.264
Come on, could somebody
gimme a hand with this stuff?

05:12.520 --> 05:13.521
Guys.

05:16.232 --> 05:19.402
I need a signature.
Come on, I have to get back.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.697
Anton?

05:24.657 --> 05:27.702
Hello? Anybody?

05:30.288 --> 05:31.498
Hello?

05:33.416 --> 05:34.584
Hey!

05:35.752 --> 05:36.961
Guys?

05:37.420 --> 05:44.427
Ah, ah, ah, ah

05:49.099 --> 05:50.266
Twist and shout

05:50.350 --> 05:51.518
Come on, come on, come on

05:51.601 --> 05:52.936
Come on, baby, now

05:53.019 --> 05:54.187
Come on, baby

05:54.270 --> 05:55.939
Come on and work it on out

05:58.441 --> 06:00.860
You know you look so good

06:11.746 --> 06:16.751
Ah, ah, ah, ah

07:40.502 --> 07:42.128
Susie, where's your hairnet?

07:42.671 --> 07:44.381
Not a whole lotta crab, huh?

07:44.464 --> 07:46.132
Nah, it's been shit this year.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.551
Getting worse every year.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.888
Where's the ambulance?
We don't need nobody dyin' in here.

07:51.971 --> 07:53.973
They're comin'. I was closer.

07:54.849 --> 07:57.060
Y'all get your asses back to work!

07:57.811 --> 07:59.562
Them loads ain't packin' themselves.

07:59.646 --> 08:00.855
Let's go!

08:03.441 --> 08:05.276
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

08:06.277 --> 08:07.153
Sir?

08:08.196 --> 08:11.991
Fucker's not gonna die.
He's just too drunk to get up.

08:12.075 --> 08:14.369
Sir? Sir?

08:15.120 --> 08:18.581
-Sir?
-I told you. He's just too wasted.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.082
Did you hit this man, ma'am?

08:21.084 --> 08:24.713
Asshole hit Blair, then I hit the asshole.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.173
With a metal bucket?

08:28.842 --> 08:32.721
What's your name, hon?
Who's your Aaka?

08:32.804 --> 08:36.140
Did you or did you not hit this man
with a metal bucket, ma'am?

08:36.224 --> 08:38.058
Damn right I hit him with a metal bucket.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.270
You puttin' me away for that, hon?

08:40.352 --> 08:42.647
Hell yeah. I mean--

08:42.731 --> 08:45.358
Sir, I'd like to speak
with these women now.

08:46.985 --> 08:49.988
-If he fuckin' dies--
-Now, sir.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.246
Alright, what's the story here?

08:58.872 --> 09:02.083
He hits me, I moved out,
he didn't like it.

09:02.667 --> 09:05.545
She moved in with me, mind you.
Not with some guy.

09:06.504 --> 09:09.507
-Did he--
-No, that's just the job.

09:10.008 --> 09:12.594
Playin' with sharp things
after a first or second shift

09:12.677 --> 09:14.637
on some other job will get you chopped.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.723
You fucking bitch!

09:16.806 --> 09:19.601
-You broke my fucking nose!
-Hey, hey!

09:21.394 --> 09:23.355
-Miss, are you pressin' charges?
-What?

09:23.438 --> 09:25.607
Damn right, she is.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.901
Sir, you're under arrest
for assault and battery.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.611
The fucking bitch hit me!

09:30.487 --> 09:34.449
Fuck you too!
Fucking bitch-pig! Fuck!

09:37.118 --> 09:38.411
I can't talk right now.

09:38.495 --> 09:39.662
You actually on the phone?

09:40.288 --> 09:42.290
You're on the fucking phone?

10:28.712 --> 10:32.007
So this is what this place looks like
on the inside, huh?

10:32.090 --> 10:33.925
You ever been out here?

10:34.009 --> 10:36.469
Oh yeah, Liz, with my
polar chemistry Ph.D., you mean?

10:37.929 --> 10:40.557
Can't find my glasses.

10:42.100 --> 10:44.310
-Any vehicles missin'?
-Nope.

10:44.686 --> 10:45.687
This is it.

10:49.566 --> 10:52.152
We don't think that they
just went out for a stroll?

10:52.694 --> 10:53.862
No.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.407
Well, shit.

10:58.575 --> 10:59.576
Yeah.

11:00.535 --> 11:03.580
Just the third day of dark
and it's already gettin' weird.

11:11.838 --> 11:14.049
Where is that fucking song?

11:20.889 --> 11:23.475
-Where is it?
-Morning, Chief.

11:23.558 --> 11:24.934
Where's--

11:25.018 --> 11:27.395
Yeah, sorry, we can't turn that off.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.064
It's gettin' on my nerves too.

11:29.147 --> 11:31.024
Tried to cover it up,
muffle the sound a little.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.568
There's no buttons.
Can't find the remote.

11:33.651 --> 11:37.072
Those don't open.
That does not open.

11:37.155 --> 11:39.574
Nah, those don't open either.

11:41.159 --> 11:42.452
Look at that.

11:53.505 --> 11:55.507
Not a Beatles fan, okay?

11:57.175 --> 11:58.677
Alright, what do we know, Pete?

11:59.636 --> 12:02.472
A supply guy found the station
empty this morning.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.349
He called it in.

12:04.849 --> 12:07.435
-The scientists' last contact was--
-Speak up, Peter.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.062
I can hear him just fine.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.773
So when was their last contact with town?

12:11.856 --> 12:13.233
It was a week ago.

12:13.316 --> 12:14.859
They called for some supplies.

12:14.943 --> 12:17.821
And who's contacting the families?

12:17.904 --> 12:21.783
Lulu, but they're
from all around the world,

12:21.866 --> 12:24.285
so, ya know, takin' a minute.

12:24.786 --> 12:26.788
And who pays for this place?

12:27.288 --> 12:28.915
Government grants?

12:29.916 --> 12:31.126
You askin' me?

12:31.501 --> 12:32.919
I'll check on the funding.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.631
Look what I found.

12:45.849 --> 12:47.600
It's like they went to take a leak,

12:48.143 --> 12:50.061
never came back.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.023
Alright. Here we go.

12:54.065 --> 12:57.110
Alright. Tsalal Station's been
operating for 18 years,

12:57.193 --> 13:00.530
researching Arctic geology, biology,

13:00.613 --> 13:03.783
and the impacts of climate change.

13:15.086 --> 13:17.547
Ralph Emerson, geology.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.676
Anton Kotov, geophysics.

13:22.260 --> 13:24.888
-All men, huh?
-Yep.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.518
Li Jie, geobiology.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.065
Raymond Clark, paleomicrobiology.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.655
Lucas Merens, environmental chemistry.

13:45.200 --> 13:49.245
Facundo Molina and Veer Mehta,
biophysics.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.414
And Anders Lund,

13:51.498 --> 13:53.958
founder-director, structural biology.

13:58.922 --> 14:02.884
They live here all year long?
All alone? Just like monks?

14:03.802 --> 14:07.097
What are they looking for?
Digging that ice up.

14:07.180 --> 14:11.351
I think the origin of life?

14:12.560 --> 14:14.062
That thing.

14:33.164 --> 14:36.626
Sat phones are back there.
These are the cells I could find.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.169
This one was charging,

14:38.253 --> 14:41.548
and that one was just there,
just like that.

14:42.340 --> 14:45.510
-Dead battery.
-Who leaves their cell behind?

14:45.593 --> 14:48.179
Well, it's not like there's a lotta
cell signal out there.

14:48.263 --> 14:50.724
It's not like there's a lotta
anything out there.

14:50.807 --> 14:53.935
Alright, well, let's get the cell records
and the radio log, Pete.

14:55.437 --> 14:57.647
Yeah, that ham seems pretty fresh.

15:01.943 --> 15:04.738
Alright, we're gonna call in rescue.

15:04.821 --> 15:06.948
Let's get the choppers,
ping this site as an LKP,

15:07.032 --> 15:08.950
and then 15 miles POA.

15:11.036 --> 15:12.287
Word'll spread.

15:12.704 --> 15:14.622
Their families will be upset.

15:14.706 --> 15:18.126
And if these dorks turn out to be just out
on some geek expedition,

15:18.668 --> 15:20.337
don't you wanna hold off for a bit?

15:20.420 --> 15:21.546
No, Hank, I don't.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.840
We're late to the party already.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.302
The ham and the sandwich
may seem fresh,

15:27.385 --> 15:30.055
but the mayo is like syrup.

15:30.138 --> 15:32.682
Mayo doesn't go runny until a couple days
out of the fridge.

15:32.766 --> 15:35.060
But your processed cold cuts,

15:35.143 --> 15:36.936
they'll survive the apocalypse.

15:38.480 --> 15:39.814
The things you learn when your kid

15:39.898 --> 15:41.983
leaves their lunch in the back seat
of the car.

15:42.859 --> 15:46.863
You were never much of a sandwich-makin'
kinda dad, was he, Pete?

15:49.449 --> 15:51.659
Clothes in that washer stink.

15:52.827 --> 15:54.412
It's gonna take wet clothes
a couple of days

15:54.496 --> 15:56.456
to stink that bad.

15:57.540 --> 16:00.502
These men disappeared
48 hours ago, at least.

16:00.585 --> 16:01.795
Least.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.967
Alright, let's take a look at that tongue.

16:12.347 --> 16:15.392
Two days. Startin' to discolor.

16:16.226 --> 16:17.644
Maybe it's not human.

16:18.687 --> 16:20.689
It's human, all right.

16:21.231 --> 16:22.649
See there?

16:24.275 --> 16:25.610
That a bite?

16:25.985 --> 16:26.986
No.

16:28.071 --> 16:32.283
Those are marks
left by a repetitive behavior.

16:32.534 --> 16:35.495
Remember that Native auntie
that we found a year ago,

16:35.578 --> 16:37.372
-frozen solid?
-Yeah, yeah.

16:38.206 --> 16:40.834
Outside Saint Joseph
of the Arctic, right?

16:40.917 --> 16:42.752
Yeah. She had the same marks.

16:43.420 --> 16:47.882
Comes from lickin' the thread
when you're fixin' the fishin' nets.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.343
That is a native woman's tongue.

16:51.261 --> 16:52.387
Jesus.

16:53.638 --> 16:55.098
Dead or alive, you think?

16:55.181 --> 16:58.685
Gonna have to wait until the lab
in Anchorage processes this baggie.

16:58.768 --> 17:00.395
In the meantime, Hank?

17:00.729 --> 17:01.730
Yup?

17:02.397 --> 17:04.566
Why don't you hit up command
and see if they got

17:04.648 --> 17:07.277
a tongue-less lady
in some fridge somewhere.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.702
Prior, call Central.

17:15.785 --> 17:17.494
Your father's havin' a brain fart.

17:17.954 --> 17:19.414
Hey.

17:20.498 --> 17:23.667
Lulu, Hank Prior.
Put me through to Central.

17:23.752 --> 17:25.377
Right on it, Hank.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.929
Alright, folks,
Christmas is coming.

17:35.013 --> 17:36.723
Can't stop it.

17:36.806 --> 17:38.475
Ya have your presents lined up?

17:39.351 --> 17:40.894
Yeah. Me neither.

17:40.977 --> 17:44.856
We're gonna take calls, though.
Alright. Anyone out there? Hello?

17:46.149 --> 17:47.359
Hello?

17:54.949 --> 17:57.243
Is there anybody there?

18:05.293 --> 18:06.920
Hello, Travis.

18:13.051 --> 18:14.886
What do you want?

18:31.069 --> 18:32.445
-I left a few messages...
-Hey, Lulu.

18:32.529 --> 18:34.239
...and I'm trying to reach
Dr. Molina's family.

18:34.322 --> 18:35.740
Has he called?

18:40.745 --> 18:41.621
You have a message.

18:41.705 --> 18:43.998
-There's someone in your office...
-Coffee.

18:44.082 --> 18:46.084
...but it's her.

18:47.711 --> 18:50.338
-It's not her tongue.
-How do you know?

18:50.547 --> 18:53.508
It's been six years.
Can't be her tongue.

18:53.591 --> 18:55.385
But it's a woman's tongue?

18:55.468 --> 18:56.678
I don't know.

18:57.262 --> 18:59.848
Right. Let me see it, then.

18:59.931 --> 19:00.932
No.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.936
You got bounced off the case, 'member?

19:05.562 --> 19:06.938
You're a trooper now.

19:07.022 --> 19:09.357
You're not A.P.F. anymore, 'member that?

19:10.400 --> 19:11.985
It's a woman's tongue.

19:12.068 --> 19:14.070
It's an Inupiaq woman's tongue.

19:15.155 --> 19:16.948
And you know this because

19:17.699 --> 19:19.993
your spirit animal came to you in a dream?

19:20.076 --> 19:23.038
Nah, my spirit animal eats
old fuckin' white ladies

19:23.121 --> 19:24.831
like you for breakfast, Danvers.

19:25.331 --> 19:26.916
Careful.

19:32.213 --> 19:34.174
How's daddy Connelly?

19:34.841 --> 19:36.134
Treatin' ya good?

19:36.217 --> 19:39.637
Ah, right. Is that all, Trooper Navarro?

19:41.765 --> 19:45.977
I'm sure you got some
caribou to scrape off the road somewhere.

19:46.061 --> 19:48.438
You never even wanted
to look at her files.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.940
And now you're just
brushin' her off like...

19:51.608 --> 19:53.234
like she's--

19:57.572 --> 19:59.157
Did you get all that?

20:01.326 --> 20:03.286
What file is she talkin' about?

20:04.120 --> 20:08.792
Alright, go look in the cold case files.
Get me Anne Masu Kowtok.

20:10.418 --> 20:13.088
-Hello?
-Is this Elizabeth Danvers?

20:13.838 --> 20:15.715
-Yeah.
-This is Kerri Gillard.

20:15.799 --> 20:17.342
Sheri's mom.

20:17.425 --> 20:19.302
Sheri Gillard, from Leah's class?

20:19.386 --> 20:21.054
Oh, yeah. I can't talk to you right now.

20:21.137 --> 20:22.639
I really, really need to talk to you,
Mrs. Danvers.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.015
I'm gonna call you back later when--

20:24.099 --> 20:26.518
No, we need to talk now! Like, right now!

20:28.269 --> 20:31.022
-She's 15 years old!
-I got it. I understand.

20:31.106 --> 20:32.607
15 years old!

20:35.568 --> 20:37.112
Do you understand?

20:37.779 --> 20:39.698
No, this is your daughter initiating this.

20:39.781 --> 20:41.074
Alright, let's not escalate it.

20:41.157 --> 20:42.367
Let's talk about it in a week,

20:42.450 --> 20:44.077
see if it improves.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.755
-I didn't do any--
-Shut up.

21:01.094 --> 21:04.514
A video? Really?

21:05.849 --> 21:06.933
You know, you don't have to

21:07.017 --> 21:08.685
-freak out about--
-I'm not talkin' about it.

21:11.146 --> 21:13.565
I thought you were
smarter than that, Leah.

21:14.983 --> 21:16.776
Well, you know where those videos end up?

21:17.318 --> 21:19.279
They end up on porn sites.

21:19.362 --> 21:21.156
For the rest of your life,
every single time somebody

21:21.239 --> 21:23.658
-looks you up--
-Okay, well, we didn't post it.

21:23.742 --> 21:25.326
Her mom took her phone
and she freaked out.

21:25.410 --> 21:27.620
-It was just for us--
-Don't be an idiot.

21:27.704 --> 21:30.707
-People break up, 'kay? Phones get hacked.
-Oh, right.

21:30.790 --> 21:34.419
Thanks, Chief Danvers.
All criminal angles noted.

21:35.253 --> 21:36.838
Stop pretending like you give a shit now.

21:36.921 --> 21:38.631
I don't give a shit!

21:38.715 --> 21:42.218
But that woman was screaming
in my face because you--

21:43.553 --> 21:46.973
-"You" what?
-Because you made a video of--

21:48.099 --> 21:51.269
-Of what?
-Of you screwing a 15-year-old girl!

21:51.353 --> 21:54.773
Okay? You made a video
that I had to watch--

21:58.651 --> 22:01.654
Hey. Hey, are you okay?

22:01.738 --> 22:04.240
-Did we hit something?
-Nah. We didn't hit anything.

22:04.324 --> 22:07.869
It's okay. Leah, Leah.
It's just an ice slip. Alright?

22:08.411 --> 22:11.247
Alright, calm down. Calm down.

22:13.958 --> 22:15.335
It's Danvers.

22:15.418 --> 22:16.961
-Chief.
-We got in an accident.

22:17.045 --> 22:18.421
Sending ambulance, Chief.

22:18.505 --> 22:19.881
Yeah, send an ambulance.

22:19.964 --> 22:22.592
Possible injuries. We're at 5th and Front.

22:31.142 --> 22:34.020
Is that fucking Stacy Chalmers again?

22:34.104 --> 22:38.149
-I'm so sorry.
-Stacy, you idiot!

22:38.233 --> 22:39.609
Are you fuckin' drunk?

22:39.693 --> 22:42.112
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

22:42.195 --> 22:43.905
Alright, get outta the car.

22:44.197 --> 22:45.657
Get outta the car.

22:45.740 --> 22:47.325
Hey, Mrs. Danvers.

22:47.409 --> 22:50.286
Hey, you don't even have
your license anymore.

22:50.370 --> 22:54.124
My baby! She's not speakin' to me!

22:54.207 --> 22:55.500
Oh, for fuck's sake.

22:55.583 --> 22:57.502
I'm so sorry.

22:57.794 --> 22:59.796
Get your fuckin' hands off me!

22:59.879 --> 23:01.715
Turn around! Come on!
Turn around!

23:01.798 --> 23:05.719
Put your hands up right now!
Move it! Hands fuckin' up!

23:05.802 --> 23:07.637
Fuckin' bitch!

23:28.533 --> 23:30.243
She's 16.

23:30.827 --> 23:31.828
What?

23:32.954 --> 23:35.165
Sheri's 16, not 15.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.294
Oh, for fuck's sake.

24:07.655 --> 24:10.367
Agent Navarro, it's been a while.

24:10.450 --> 24:11.659
Hey, Ryan.

24:12.452 --> 24:14.079
You got a break in her case?

24:14.996 --> 24:17.082
I'm not sure yet.

24:17.165 --> 24:18.583
Want a beer?

24:19.334 --> 24:21.544
The ex asked me to watch Evan tonight.

24:21.878 --> 24:23.505
Wanna come over?

24:24.923 --> 24:25.924
Yeah.

24:28.635 --> 24:31.513
So, Annie never mentioned Tsalal?

24:31.596 --> 24:34.557
Never talked about it?
Anything?

24:35.392 --> 24:36.601
No.

24:37.686 --> 24:39.688
You found Annie had some connection?

24:40.814 --> 24:43.191
I don't know, just goin' over

24:43.274 --> 24:45.902
any angle I might've missed back then,
you know?

24:48.738 --> 24:50.532
Last of my stash.

24:50.615 --> 24:52.992
No. Maybe just some water?

24:53.451 --> 24:57.247
Water's bad.
Turned to shit about three days ago.

24:58.498 --> 25:01.334
Annie'd say, "I told you so."

25:01.751 --> 25:04.879
Look, don't take this wrong.

25:05.630 --> 25:07.757
I loved my sister,

25:07.841 --> 25:09.718
and I wish like hell she was still here,

25:09.801 --> 25:13.555
but I'm not sure it'd do much good to go
through all this again.

25:14.973 --> 25:17.976
Listen, you don't really think that, Ryan.

25:20.311 --> 25:21.312
Hey.

25:21.730 --> 25:24.190
Hey, listen to me.

25:24.774 --> 25:27.193
I know it wasn't easy for you.

25:27.819 --> 25:32.365
Annie protestin' the mine,
mine guys going at her.

25:32.449 --> 25:34.826
-It was a mess.
-Yeah.

25:36.745 --> 25:38.955
We got into some shit fights.

25:39.581 --> 25:43.460
I told her,
"You kill the mine, you kill Ennis."

25:43.543 --> 25:47.881
No jobs, no mine taxes,
no schools, nothin'.

25:48.965 --> 25:50.258
She didn't care.

25:50.800 --> 25:53.386
We were barely speakin' that last year.

26:02.604 --> 26:05.815
Do you believe in God, Agent Navarro?

26:14.240 --> 26:15.241
Yes.

26:18.286 --> 26:20.497
Mind if I ask why?

26:25.126 --> 26:26.336
My last tour--

26:33.802 --> 26:36.137
Listen.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.435
It doesn't matter.

26:44.104 --> 26:45.730
Must be nice.

26:48.316 --> 26:49.734
What?

26:50.485 --> 26:52.696
Knowing we're not alone.

26:54.656 --> 26:56.491
No, we're alone.

26:59.327 --> 27:00.745
God too.

27:09.587 --> 27:12.549
-Hello?
-Hey, Navarro. Cooper here.

27:12.632 --> 27:14.217
It happened again.

27:16.011 --> 27:18.013
I'll be there right away.

27:42.912 --> 27:45.248
-Hey, Cooper.
-Hey, Ange.

27:45.331 --> 27:46.291
How's Troopers?

27:46.374 --> 27:48.376
You know, same shit, different badge.

27:49.961 --> 27:52.005
So, she called in hysterics,

27:52.088 --> 27:53.882
said there was someone
inside the apartment,

27:53.965 --> 27:57.719
but the door is bolted from the inside
and the windows are all shut tight.

27:59.471 --> 28:00.638
Thanks for the call.

28:00.722 --> 28:03.391
Yeah, you got it.
It stays between us.

28:03.475 --> 28:04.809
Thanks.

28:16.112 --> 28:18.865
-Hey, Jules.
-Hey, Angie.

28:20.617 --> 28:21.493
What's going on?

28:21.576 --> 28:24.245
Nothing, I shouldn't have called.
I'm sorry.

28:25.288 --> 28:27.499
It was just a little freak-out.

28:28.041 --> 28:29.250
I'm okay.

28:29.959 --> 28:31.544
I'm just tired.

28:31.628 --> 28:33.046
Alright, so...

28:34.172 --> 28:36.675
why don't you come over to my place,
we eat some junk food,

28:36.758 --> 28:38.218
watch "The Bachelor," come on.

28:38.301 --> 28:39.969
I never should've moved here.

28:40.053 --> 28:41.888
-I'm so sorry.
-Hey, Jules, Jules.

28:41.971 --> 28:44.808
Come here. Hey, look at me. Hey.

28:45.225 --> 28:48.311
I wanted you here.
I'm glad you're here, okay?

28:48.853 --> 28:50.855
Listen, I'm not like Mom.

28:51.523 --> 28:53.942
You are nothing like Mom.

28:54.442 --> 28:56.653
You are not her, okay?

28:56.986 --> 28:58.405
You hear me?

29:05.453 --> 29:08.164
If you're worried, we can start talking
some options.

29:08.248 --> 29:12.419
No hospitals.
You promised me no hospitals.

29:12.502 --> 29:15.380
'Kay, so make sure you're good, Jules.

29:15.463 --> 29:18.466
I'm okay. I promise.

29:19.217 --> 29:21.094
I got this.

29:40.864 --> 29:43.658
Alright, so, if you look at the funding,

29:43.742 --> 29:48.747
most of the funding to Tsalal comes from
an NGO, but some of it

29:48.830 --> 29:51.958
-comes--
-I want to go home!

29:59.591 --> 30:02.594
-But if you try and--
-Please!

30:05.764 --> 30:08.016
-Like she's dying.
-So--

30:08.099 --> 30:11.478
Lemme go!

30:14.773 --> 30:16.274
Oh, thanks.

30:17.442 --> 30:19.027
-Here we go.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.

30:19.110 --> 30:21.029
-What are you doin'?
-Putting us all out of our misery.

30:21.112 --> 30:23.073
The fuck you are! She's still drunk.

30:23.156 --> 30:24.657
Yeah, so, I'll drive her home.

30:24.741 --> 30:28.703
Nah, I'm not letting a still-drunk DUI out
just because sometimes she blows you.

30:28.787 --> 30:30.538
-Hey!
-End of story!

30:30.622 --> 30:32.665
Back in. Back in!

30:36.920 --> 30:38.797
I need some toilet paper!

30:38.880 --> 30:41.508
You know, for the record,
I have a fiancÃ©e.

30:41.591 --> 30:42.884
Oh, yeah?

30:42.967 --> 30:44.552
Natasha from the catalog?

30:44.636 --> 30:45.929
She's not from a catalog.

30:46.012 --> 30:46.930
She's from Vladivostok,

30:47.013 --> 30:49.057
and she's coming for Christmas.

30:49.724 --> 30:51.434
We're getting married, just so you know.

30:51.518 --> 30:54.062
A Christmas wedding. That's festive.

30:54.145 --> 30:56.564
-This girlfriend stays in.
-Sorry, Stace.

30:56.648 --> 30:58.483
-You heard the man.
-I hate you!

30:59.609 --> 31:02.862
Yeah, and I need the Anne Kowtok file.
You got it.

31:03.238 --> 31:05.615
-Do I?
-Yeah. It's at your place.

31:05.699 --> 31:07.951
You took a bunch of case files home
after the flood.

31:08.034 --> 31:10.245
I don't think so. I'll check.

31:10.787 --> 31:12.288
-When?
-Soon.

31:12.372 --> 31:15.667
-I hate you all!
-Shut up!

31:15.750 --> 31:19.879
-He has the files?
-I hate you all!

31:22.674 --> 31:24.300
What you doin' down there, Darwin?

31:25.510 --> 31:27.137
Doin' a drawin'?

31:29.055 --> 31:30.682
Oh, what's this?

31:35.270 --> 31:36.688
You do this?

31:40.108 --> 31:41.359
Kayla?

31:42.027 --> 31:43.028
Yeah?

31:44.988 --> 31:46.197
What's this?

31:47.574 --> 31:49.325
Just a local legend.

31:49.743 --> 31:53.788
You leave him at the laundromat
with your grandma?

31:53.872 --> 31:55.582
-Yeah, I did.
-Right.

31:55.665 --> 31:56.958
-You know why?
-Okay.

31:58.209 --> 31:59.961
Yeah, I'm sorry I was late.

32:00.045 --> 32:01.629
It's just the Tsalal thing.

32:01.713 --> 32:03.089
-It's been kinda crazy, so.
-It's fine.

32:03.381 --> 32:06.259
It's all good, but I have classes,

32:06.343 --> 32:09.220
so my grandma's there
to take care of Darwin,

32:09.304 --> 32:12.015
and she happens to like
to tell him stories from his culture.

32:12.098 --> 32:15.560
Alright, so when the stories that
his grandma tells him,

32:15.643 --> 32:19.105
they give him bad dreams,
I can just put you on the phone, right?

32:19.189 --> 32:21.775
You'll talk to him,
explain why it's important.

32:21.858 --> 32:23.234
You're such a white boy.

32:24.402 --> 32:27.238
How the hell did I fall for a white boy?

32:37.165 --> 32:38.583
Oh, no you don't.

32:39.417 --> 32:41.044
Seriously?

33:00.355 --> 33:01.981
I gotta take this.

33:06.903 --> 33:08.488
Fuck!

33:08.571 --> 33:10.365
-Kayla!
-Seriously?

33:10.448 --> 33:13.743
-It's work.
-Work ends at six. That's Danvers.

33:13.827 --> 33:16.496
I gotta take it. Fuck.

33:17.163 --> 33:18.707
-Hey, Chief.
-I need you to get me something

33:18.790 --> 33:20.125
from your dad's.

33:20.208 --> 33:21.376
Sorry, Chief.

33:21.459 --> 33:23.169
No. Please?

33:23.253 --> 33:26.006
Did I hear no?
Weird.

33:26.089 --> 33:29.718
Yeah, I think it was a no.
Must be the connection.

33:44.733 --> 33:47.277
-Hey.
-Hey, Dad.

33:50.071 --> 33:51.531
Everything okay?

33:51.614 --> 33:54.409
Yeah, I promised Darwin

33:54.492 --> 33:57.078
I would show him an old photo of me
when I was his age.

33:57.162 --> 34:00.040
-Ah, okay.
-You mind if I take a look?

34:00.123 --> 34:01.750
Ah, that's fine.

34:09.507 --> 34:11.509
Yeah, careful. Still wet.

34:14.721 --> 34:16.014
That is

34:16.097 --> 34:17.891
really blue.

34:17.974 --> 34:19.893
Well, Alina likes blue.

34:23.480 --> 34:24.688
Too blue?

34:25.398 --> 34:27.567
It's blue, but--

34:29.402 --> 34:30.612
Too damn blue.

34:30.695 --> 34:33.072
No. No, no, no. It's great.

34:33.156 --> 34:35.992
-It's a change.
-Yeah, you want a beer?

34:37.243 --> 34:38.661
No. I'm good, thank you.

34:43.708 --> 34:44.708
Fuck.

34:45.377 --> 34:47.795
-You sure?
-Yeah.

34:50.924 --> 34:53.301
Actually, you got anything to eat?

34:53.385 --> 34:56.012
Like, chips or somethin'?
I'm starvin'.

34:56.888 --> 34:58.390
Let me check.

35:03.186 --> 35:06.606
Pretty tapped out.
I gotta grocery shop.

35:06.690 --> 35:08.483
You want an apple?

35:08.566 --> 35:10.568
No, I'm good.

35:12.529 --> 35:15.532
You want to go out, grab a bite?

35:17.409 --> 35:22.038
Nope. I promised I'd put
Darwin to bed, so.

35:29.838 --> 35:31.965
Let me see what you took.

35:44.519 --> 35:46.521
Didn't know I still had that.

35:47.856 --> 35:49.149
Watch yourself on the ice.

35:49.232 --> 35:51.234
It's slick as shit out there.

36:47.332 --> 36:49.292
You take Darwin to see Santa yet?

36:49.376 --> 36:51.920
Not yet, but I'm working on it.

36:52.003 --> 36:56.007
Well, dude, you better be
or else Kayla's gonna kick your pink ass.

36:56.091 --> 36:59.803
I think I liked it better when I babysat
and she couldn't talk back.

36:59.886 --> 37:01.096
Thanks.

37:01.429 --> 37:03.807
So this case is connected to Tsalal?

37:03.890 --> 37:04.891
No.

37:06.351 --> 37:07.686
-No?
-No.

37:07.769 --> 37:09.187
That's all I get?

37:09.729 --> 37:12.982
Chief, my dad is gonna kill me
if he finds out I took these.

37:13.733 --> 37:16.194
Alright, take the Christmas tree box
into the living room.

37:16.277 --> 37:18.154
-Did you eat?
-Nope.

37:18.238 --> 37:21.866
-When have I got time to fuckin' eat?
-Well, you gotta eat.

37:24.619 --> 37:27.414
The body was found on the edge
of the Villages.

37:27.497 --> 37:29.499
Navarro was the first on the scene.

37:37.048 --> 37:40.927
Her name was Anne Masu Kowtok.

37:43.138 --> 37:45.140
People called her Annie K.

37:45.974 --> 37:48.184
Stabbed 32 times

37:49.102 --> 37:51.730
with a sharp, unidentified object.

37:53.273 --> 37:54.899
Star-shaped wounds.

37:55.859 --> 37:58.028
Murder weapon never found.

37:58.111 --> 37:59.320
Missing tongue?

38:00.572 --> 38:02.782
Yeah. Never recovered.

38:04.784 --> 38:07.829
I knew about the dead girl
out in the Villages, but...

38:08.246 --> 38:10.123
I didn't know about the tongue.

38:11.791 --> 38:14.127
Yep, we kept that from the public.

38:18.465 --> 38:23.345
She was a midwife, activist, protester.

38:23.428 --> 38:26.765
You know, fighting the mine like crazy,
drivin' everybody nuts.

38:26.848 --> 38:28.850
Workers, mine folks.

38:29.517 --> 38:31.144
A lotta haters.

38:33.688 --> 38:34.689
But this?

38:36.649 --> 38:38.693
Nobody deserves that.

38:44.616 --> 38:45.867
You lied to her.

38:46.284 --> 38:47.702
Navarro.

38:48.912 --> 38:51.414
You do know the case.
You studied it.

38:52.290 --> 38:54.125
Mind your own business, kid.

38:54.459 --> 38:57.295
You made it my business
when you asked me to steal these for you.

38:58.088 --> 39:00.382
I asked you to relocate them.

39:00.465 --> 39:07.305
Fine. I will relocate them back to my dad,
and you can ask him for them.

39:08.098 --> 39:10.100
You bluff for shit, you know that?

39:11.685 --> 39:14.688
Alright. Okay. Sit down.
It's gettin' cold.

39:16.398 --> 39:18.191
Here's the story.

39:18.274 --> 39:19.859
Navarro was obsessed with the case.

39:19.943 --> 39:22.487
She's got this thing
about women who get hurt.

39:22.570 --> 39:23.571
I don't know.

39:23.655 --> 39:26.116
She didn't get anywhere with it,
but she wouldn't let it go

39:26.199 --> 39:28.159
and started buggin' the wrong people.

39:28.827 --> 39:30.245
Mine people.

39:31.037 --> 39:33.081
Kate McKittrick, specifically.

39:33.164 --> 39:34.958
-Fuck.
-Yeah.

39:35.041 --> 39:37.961
Showed up at her house,
started demanding answers,

39:38.044 --> 39:41.881
and she got in a couple of fights
with some mine workers.

39:41.965 --> 39:43.717
Your dad had to take her off the case.

39:44.342 --> 39:46.261
And when I came to town

39:47.721 --> 39:49.723
we started working together, and

39:50.306 --> 39:51.850
she asked me to pick it back up.

39:51.933 --> 39:53.518
And you didn't?

39:56.187 --> 39:57.939
This one was never gonna be solved.

39:58.314 --> 39:59.524
What do you mean?

40:00.442 --> 40:02.068
Ennis killed Annie.

40:02.444 --> 40:04.070
This fucking place.

40:05.113 --> 40:07.198
No killer was ever gonna be found.

40:11.786 --> 40:14.664
That a Tinder match or somethin'?

40:14.748 --> 40:16.166
Fantasy football.

40:16.499 --> 40:17.876
I got two running backs on I.R.

40:17.959 --> 40:20.170
I got a wide receiver who's a klutz.

40:20.628 --> 40:22.839
I don't know who the fuck
I'm gonna start on Sunday.

40:41.733 --> 40:44.861
-Evangeline.
-Qavvik.

41:10.053 --> 41:11.721
Wait, fuck.

41:15.392 --> 41:16.351
Wait!

41:36.871 --> 41:38.248
Fuck, Gi.

41:46.631 --> 41:48.299
Fuck.

41:53.888 --> 41:56.558
SpongeBob? Really?

41:56.641 --> 41:59.352
SpongeBob is cool.
He cleans your teeth.

41:59.436 --> 42:01.438
He lives in a pineapple.

42:03.106 --> 42:04.899
Hey, what are you doing?

42:04.983 --> 42:08.778
Don't do that. No.
It's disgusting. No.

42:17.037 --> 42:18.246
I gotta go.

42:19.289 --> 42:20.915
Your sister?

42:21.708 --> 42:23.168
Why, has she been actin' off?

42:23.251 --> 42:24.794
No. She's...

42:25.587 --> 42:28.590
she's just been missing some work,
it's nothing major.

42:29.924 --> 42:32.552
Gotta swing by the booze depot.

42:33.345 --> 42:37.891
Don't go.
You can take a gallon of my homebrew.

42:37.974 --> 42:41.478
Yeah.
I don't wanna go blind yet.

42:41.561 --> 42:44.397
My homebrew brings
all the boys to the yard.

42:45.774 --> 42:48.401
Are you tellin' that to a cop, Qavvik?

43:02.916 --> 43:03.917
Hey.

43:05.418 --> 43:08.421
Next time you call,
I'm not gonna pick up the phone.

43:18.431 --> 43:19.349
Hey.

43:19.808 --> 43:21.476
No, that's my toothbrush.

43:21.559 --> 43:22.936
Well, I need it!

43:33.613 --> 43:35.824
Hey, about earlier.

43:37.909 --> 43:40.120
You mean about you makin' dirty videos?

43:40.870 --> 43:41.871
No.

43:43.498 --> 43:45.125
About people driving drunk.

43:49.170 --> 43:52.924
Ya know, it's really stupid
that we never talk about that day.

43:56.761 --> 43:58.763
We're doin' Christmas this year.

43:59.180 --> 44:00.682
I'm gonna cook.

44:05.437 --> 44:08.064
Ya know, you don't really
have to be my mom, Liz.

44:09.274 --> 44:11.484
Think my dad would've understood.

44:15.030 --> 44:16.656
I'm takin' a shower.

44:26.875 --> 44:29.294
-Night, Manny.
-Night, officer.

44:30.545 --> 44:32.797
She's gonna come right back
begging for this,

44:32.881 --> 44:34.466
and I'm gonna give it to her so hard,

44:34.549 --> 44:37.010
her eyes are gonna pop right off that
fugly face of hers,

44:37.093 --> 44:39.304
and I'm gonna stuff her mouth with all
the fuckin' bills

44:39.387 --> 44:40.764
-I've been payin'.
-Yeah, man.

44:40.847 --> 44:41.848
Bitch broke my fucking--

45:01.576 --> 45:03.995
Merry Christmas, motherfucker.

45:14.839 --> 45:16.800
Mommy?

45:16.883 --> 45:18.718
Holden?

45:20.595 --> 45:22.305
She's awake.

45:49.416 --> 45:51.584
Hi, Miss Irniq.
Thanks for returning my call.

45:51.668 --> 45:53.044
I hope I didn't wake you up.

45:53.128 --> 45:54.713
-I'm not sleeping much these days.
-No, no.

45:54.796 --> 45:58.883
I was just going through some old notes,
filing some stuff,

45:58.967 --> 46:00.760
reaching out to Annie's contacts.

46:00.844 --> 46:05.306
Do you remember Annie
ever mentioning the Tsalal Station?

46:05.724 --> 46:08.935
Tsalal? That place with the scientists?

46:11.062 --> 46:12.063
Hello?

46:14.024 --> 46:15.191
Ma'am, hello?

46:15.275 --> 46:16.443
She's awake!

51:03.271 --> 51:06.274
Ennis Police! Step out slowly.

51:16.326 --> 51:18.411
This is an A.P.F. investigation.

51:20.914 --> 51:22.290
I have a badge.

51:22.374 --> 51:25.377
A trooper's badge. You're trespassin'.

51:27.504 --> 51:29.506
Trespassing, huh?

51:30.799 --> 51:32.634
You gonna book me?

51:36.596 --> 51:40.016
Still really carry it, don't you?
Annie's case.

51:40.767 --> 51:42.477
We carry 'em all.

51:42.560 --> 51:43.978
No, we don't.

51:45.230 --> 51:47.148
What are you lookin' for?

51:47.774 --> 51:51.277
I don't know.
Anything that might've belonged to her.

51:51.361 --> 51:53.613
A shoe, an earring.

51:53.697 --> 51:54.864
A coat?

51:58.535 --> 52:02.163
Alright. You can look around, this once,

52:02.706 --> 52:05.125
but the Tsalal men's case is mine.

52:05.542 --> 52:06.751
What coat?

52:07.919 --> 52:09.129
This one.

52:16.219 --> 52:19.681
So you did look into the case,
didn't you?

52:19.764 --> 52:22.392
-Back then.
-Yeah. It doesn't mean shit.

52:22.726 --> 52:25.937
It's one parka.
Could be thousands of 'em.

52:28.231 --> 52:29.858
Right.

52:31.359 --> 52:32.944
So what are you doin' here, then?

52:33.028 --> 52:34.446
Just followin' up.

52:41.870 --> 52:44.080
The only one with a room of his own.

52:45.123 --> 52:47.000
Well, which one is him?

52:49.502 --> 52:50.920
Raymond Clark.

52:52.756 --> 52:56.384
Yeah, I've never seen this guy before.
He's not in any of our photos.

52:56.468 --> 52:58.053
Nowhere.

52:58.136 --> 53:01.139
How about Annie's brother?
Miner guy?

53:01.973 --> 53:04.726
Ryan.
Yeah, I'll show him a photo.

53:07.395 --> 53:08.605
That's it.

53:09.606 --> 53:10.690
It's not here.

53:11.566 --> 53:12.901
No parka.

53:13.109 --> 53:16.738
-Maybe he had it on when they--
-When they went poof?

53:19.449 --> 53:22.077
You don't really think
they're gonna find them, do you?

53:23.328 --> 53:25.705
You're the one who believes in miracles.

53:25.789 --> 53:28.041
Pickin' up any spirit vibes?

53:28.124 --> 53:30.877
Nope. All I'm pickin' up is
your shitty fuckin' attitude.

53:36.091 --> 53:40.095
Five, acknowledge.
Movin' to sector 2-7-8.

53:47.185 --> 53:48.603
Better watch out.

53:49.145 --> 53:50.980
That case sunk ya once.

53:54.109 --> 53:56.111
The case didn't sink me.

53:57.028 --> 53:59.364
You asked me to transfer to Troopers.

53:59.447 --> 54:01.116
Had nothin' to do with Annie.

54:01.199 --> 54:03.201
We both know what really happened.

54:04.494 --> 54:05.912
Are you done?

54:07.205 --> 54:09.207
Annie's case isn't closed.

54:10.208 --> 54:12.293
It's not closed.

54:12.877 --> 54:14.504
Just let her go.

54:15.547 --> 54:17.757
Let that poor girl go.

54:20.927 --> 54:22.345
"Let her go."

54:25.306 --> 54:26.933
You didn't find her.

54:38.319 --> 54:39.529
You didn't see the hate.

54:42.449 --> 54:45.285
You could see the disgust
in the way they cut her.

54:48.163 --> 54:53.043
Forensics showed that someone kicked her
after they dumped her dead body, Liz.

54:53.710 --> 54:57.922
Poor girl's just lyin' there,
and they still kick her.

54:58.840 --> 55:01.843
Broken teeth, broken ribs.

55:03.345 --> 55:05.555
And then they cut out her tongue.

55:07.349 --> 55:09.351
To shut her the fuck up.

55:11.978 --> 55:14.022
Wouldn't've happened
if she was white, though.

55:15.190 --> 55:16.066
Wouldn't've made any difference

55:16.149 --> 55:17.859
-what color her skin was.
-Yes the fuck it would have.

55:17.942 --> 55:19.402
They would've had the whole
fuckin' police force out

55:19.486 --> 55:20.737
lookin' for a white ass.

55:20.820 --> 55:23.239
No, you're not gonna blame her on me.

55:23.323 --> 55:25.533
And I wasn't even here.
You know who was here?

55:25.617 --> 55:28.453
You. You were here.

55:28.536 --> 55:31.373
It was your case all those months.
You didn't close it.

55:31.456 --> 55:32.665
You.

55:34.668 --> 55:35.877
Exactly.

55:46.888 --> 55:48.264
Did you get the cell records?

55:48.348 --> 55:50.266
No, we got a call.

55:51.184 --> 55:53.144
They found something on the ice.

55:55.855 --> 55:56.856
Chief?

55:57.565 --> 55:59.359
Chief, can you hear me?

55:59.442 --> 56:01.152
Yeah, talk to me, Prior.

56:03.363 --> 56:05.532
Rose Aguineau, Chief.

56:06.074 --> 56:07.909
Rose Aguineau found it.

56:38.565 --> 56:41.151
-Hey, Rose.
-Morning, Missy.

56:41.234 --> 56:44.237
-How did you find them?
-Travis showed me.

56:49.492 --> 56:50.910
Travis.

56:51.870 --> 56:54.289
Travis is dead, Rose.

56:55.790 --> 56:56.791
I know.
