00:05.875 --> 00:07.659
Hello. Good morning, everybody.

00:07.703 --> 00:09.096
Can I have your attention?

00:09.139 --> 00:10.662
Hi.

00:10.706 --> 00:12.490
I want to thank you all
for coming.

00:12.534 --> 00:13.970
I was told there'd be bagels.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.841
- And there will be.
- And cream cheese?

00:15.885 --> 00:17.234
What is this, my first day?

00:17.278 --> 00:19.410
Okay, I want
to start

00:19.454 --> 00:21.412
with some very exciting news.

00:21.456 --> 00:23.458
If you're making the bathrooms
gender-neutral,

00:23.501 --> 00:25.547
I'll go outside in the bushes.

00:25.590 --> 00:28.811
"We suffer more in imagination
than we do in reality."

00:28.854 --> 00:31.379
Seneca, Roman philosopher.

00:31.422 --> 00:34.034
"I only pee
next to other dudes."

00:34.077 --> 00:37.124
Spencer Williams,
American patriot.

00:37.167 --> 00:38.647
Okay, um,

00:38.690 --> 00:40.736
the news is...

00:40.779 --> 00:45.784
...I bought the Valley Hills
Assisted Living Facility.

00:45.828 --> 00:47.047
Where you do the living...

00:47.090 --> 00:49.092
And we do the assisting.

00:50.746 --> 00:52.443
I told you that would die.

00:53.444 --> 00:54.532
So, you actually did it?

00:54.576 --> 00:55.751
You bought the place?

00:55.794 --> 00:57.405
I did.

00:57.448 --> 00:59.233
A-And the previous owners
were so eager to sell

00:59.276 --> 01:03.889
that they threw all you guys in,
no extra charge.

01:05.456 --> 01:08.111
Not a great feeling, is it?

01:08.155 --> 01:09.939
I have an appointment
to fix a detached retina.

01:09.982 --> 01:13.029
Can we move this along
before I go blind in one eye?

01:13.073 --> 01:15.727
So sorry, Bette. Hey,
I love the shoes, by the way.

01:15.771 --> 01:16.859
Ooh, thanks.

01:16.902 --> 01:18.426
I'm happy to loan.

01:18.469 --> 01:21.516
Um, anyway, uh,
you all know Gabby.

01:21.559 --> 01:25.868
And as of today, she is our new
administrative vice president.

01:25.911 --> 01:28.784
I'll still be rolling you
over when you have bed sores

01:28.827 --> 01:29.872
and sterilizing
your catheters, but now

01:29.915 --> 01:33.049
I have a parking spot.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.790
We'll talk about that later.

01:34.833 --> 01:39.142
And I'd also like to introduce
you to my friend Gideon,

01:39.186 --> 01:41.318
who is our new head nurse.

01:41.362 --> 01:43.625
In addition to caring
for your health needs,

01:43.668 --> 01:46.932
I will also be reviving the
Valley Hills theater program.

01:46.976 --> 01:48.891
So be sure to sign up
for our first production,

01:48.934 --> 01:51.589
<i>La Cage aux Folles.</i>

01:51.633 --> 01:54.070
Maybe you should loan <i>
this</i> one your shoes.

01:55.376 --> 01:57.378
And I am very grateful

01:57.421 --> 01:59.423
to Mrs. Ludlum, who
has agreed to stay on

01:59.467 --> 02:04.385
and help me turn this into
the happiest place on Earth.

02:04.428 --> 02:06.300
Suck on that, Disneyland.

02:07.301 --> 02:09.433
Now, as you all know,

02:09.477 --> 02:12.219
Mr. Knudsen left me
a-a great deal of money.

02:12.262 --> 02:14.743
I let him watch me shower,
and he left me nothing.

02:16.745 --> 02:19.704
Well, isn't that
a special memory?

02:19.748 --> 02:21.967
Uh, the thing is, um,

02:22.011 --> 02:23.491
I didn't just buy this place,

02:23.534 --> 02:25.797
I am determined
to make it better.

02:25.841 --> 02:29.453
Is this shower deal
available to anyone?

02:29.497 --> 02:31.586
Okay, okay, moving on.

02:31.629 --> 02:33.631
I want to open up the floor
and hear from you guys.

02:33.675 --> 02:37.548
What can we do to make your
golden years your best years?

02:37.592 --> 02:39.202
Golden years?

02:39.246 --> 02:41.813
Every morning, I hack
up a gallon of phlegm,

02:41.857 --> 02:45.469
I take 28 pills, and then try
to put my Skechers on

02:45.513 --> 02:48.124
without sitting on my balls.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.778
Show me the golden.

02:51.562 --> 02:52.781
Want to make things better?

02:52.824 --> 02:54.217
My wife's dying.

02:54.261 --> 02:56.437
She's in constant pain.

02:56.480 --> 02:57.960
Whenever she hits
the call button

02:58.003 --> 03:00.702
to go to the bathroom, somebody,

03:00.745 --> 03:02.660
maybe the vice president here,

03:02.704 --> 03:04.140
can actually show
up and help her.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.185
I'm sorry,

03:05.228 --> 03:06.447
but we're understaffed,

03:06.490 --> 03:08.449
and I can't be everywhere
at once.

03:08.492 --> 03:09.928
Well, you have enough time
to smoke pot

03:09.972 --> 03:11.800
on the pickleball court.

03:11.843 --> 03:14.455
-- HARRY:
- Mm-hmm.
- Harry, I will be
hiring more staff,

03:14.498 --> 03:16.413
so waiting will no longer
be an issue.

03:16.457 --> 03:18.459
All right, what else?

03:18.502 --> 03:20.330
Perhaps the chef
could be improved upon.

03:20.374 --> 03:21.505
What's wrong with the chef?

03:21.549 --> 03:23.333
He was fired from
Southwest Airlines.

03:23.377 --> 03:26.162
Maybe there's a clue in that.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.643
Okay, we're getting a new chef.

03:28.686 --> 03:30.079
All right. Anything else?

03:30.122 --> 03:31.559
The laundry service is a joke.

03:31.602 --> 03:33.474
All my clothes
come back stretched out.

03:33.517 --> 03:34.910
Or you're shrinking.

03:34.953 --> 03:38.392
The word is "tight." I'm tight.

03:39.741 --> 03:41.264
I will look into the laundry.

03:41.308 --> 03:43.266
We need better security.

03:43.310 --> 03:45.137
We're sitting ducks
for the terrorists.

03:45.181 --> 03:47.227
Oh, sure, because they
want to kill people

03:47.270 --> 03:48.445
who are about to die.

03:48.489 --> 03:50.230
Very clever.

03:50.273 --> 03:53.581
When they get here, I'm sending
them to your room first.

03:53.624 --> 03:56.584
So they're not only coming,
they take requests?

03:56.627 --> 03:58.847
Okay, we need to get
back on track.

03:58.890 --> 04:00.327
Um...

04:00.370 --> 04:03.155
I just want to close
by saying that...

04:03.199 --> 04:08.639
being of service to you
and making your lives better

04:08.683 --> 04:11.294
is what gives my life purpose.

04:13.296 --> 04:16.865
You know what would
give <i>my</i> life purpose?

04:18.562 --> 04:20.695
♪ The more you give ♪ <i>The more you give</i>♪

04:20.738 --> 04:22.697
♪ The more you live ♪ <i>The more you live</i>♪

04:22.740 --> 04:25.961
♪ Your happiness is relative ♪ <i>Happiness</i>♪

04:26.004 --> 04:29.138
♪ And if you're feeling
like crap ♪

04:29.181 --> 04:30.922
♪ It's time to face the fact

04:30.966 --> 04:32.663

04:32.707 --> 04:34.839
♪ <i>Your prerogative</i>♪

04:34.883 --> 04:36.450
♪ To be positive.

04:44.153 --> 04:46.851
Ooh. This banana
is kind of tired.

04:46.895 --> 04:49.071
What do you say we toss it
and get you a new one?

04:53.467 --> 04:56.121
Got it. That's a keeper.

04:57.558 --> 04:59.342
How's it going?

04:59.386 --> 05:01.083
Ooh, I'm all packed up.

05:01.126 --> 05:02.998
Uh, any of my clothes
you find lying around,

05:03.041 --> 05:04.478
you can give to the Goodwill.

05:04.521 --> 05:06.871
Most of which I bought
at the Goodwill.

05:06.915 --> 05:08.917
Circle of life.

05:10.397 --> 05:12.094
I'm gonna miss you.

05:12.137 --> 05:14.183
I'm gonna miss you, too.

05:16.664 --> 05:17.882
I guess this is it.

05:18.970 --> 05:20.755
I guess so.

05:20.798 --> 05:23.975
Oh, oh, um... Your house key.

05:24.019 --> 05:25.716
No, no. You keep it.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.936
You'll always have a home here
whenever you want.

05:29.720 --> 05:31.200
Thank you.

05:34.421 --> 05:35.552
All right.

05:37.293 --> 05:39.382
I'll see you later.
Bye.

05:39.426 --> 05:40.862
Let's go, Cannoli.

05:55.877 --> 05:57.705
Hey, boy. You forget something?

05:58.749 --> 05:59.750
Oh.

06:10.718 --> 06:13.111
Hmm.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.728
Come on, come on. All right?

06:20.771 --> 06:22.077
You have to eat something.
Come on.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.818
Harry, if you don't
put that spoon down,

06:23.861 --> 06:26.255
I'm gonna take
your temperature with it.

06:26.298 --> 06:28.344
Hey, how's my favorite couple?

06:29.998 --> 06:33.218
- Terrific.
- She's not eating.

06:33.262 --> 06:35.699
Oh, come on, Meredith. You got
to keep up your strength.

06:35.743 --> 06:38.398
Why? I'm gonna arm-wrestle
the Grim Reaper?

06:38.441 --> 06:41.618
You might. We don't
know how it works.

06:41.662 --> 06:43.272
D-Don't talk like that.

06:43.315 --> 06:45.013
Don't tell her
not to talk like that.

06:45.056 --> 06:46.406
In fact, don't tell any woman

06:46.449 --> 06:47.581
not to talk like that.

06:47.624 --> 06:48.886
He's sorry.

06:49.670 --> 06:51.541
Tell her you're sorry.

06:51.585 --> 06:52.673
You just said it.

06:54.457 --> 06:56.590
I'm sorry.

06:57.634 --> 06:59.070
Okay.

06:59.114 --> 07:02.073
Um, I got one of these
for everybody.

07:02.117 --> 07:04.336
Does it open a garage door?

07:04.380 --> 07:06.426
Well, it's a call button
that works with Wi-Fi,

07:06.469 --> 07:08.906
so when you press it, somebody
will come, wherever you are.

07:08.950 --> 07:10.734
Really? Let's give it a try.

07:10.778 --> 07:12.388
Oh, no, no, no.
It's really for emergencies.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.172
I saw something like this on TV.

07:14.216 --> 07:16.958
Oh, yeah, like the lady
who falls and can't get up.

07:17.001 --> 07:19.177
That's us now,
baby.

07:19.221 --> 07:20.483
Everything okay?

07:20.527 --> 07:22.877
Sorry. False alarm.

07:22.920 --> 07:25.880
Oh, we're gonna have
a lot of fun with this thing.

07:25.923 --> 07:28.926
Try yours.
Maybe someone else will come.

07:28.970 --> 07:30.928
No, no, no, no, no. No!

07:34.541 --> 07:37.979
Whatever it is, you gonna have
to wait a few minutes.

07:44.551 --> 07:47.510
Oh, hey, there, little guy.
You all done in the kitchen?

07:47.554 --> 07:49.294
Well, I sure
don't mind the company.

07:51.775 --> 07:54.474
Okay, well,
don't get stuck under the oven.

08:11.447 --> 08:12.796
What?

08:12.840 --> 08:14.581
Hey, baby girl.
Just checking in.

08:14.624 --> 08:16.670
Seeing what the haps is.

08:16.713 --> 08:18.367
I'm doing homework.

08:18.410 --> 08:20.369
Uh-huh, cool. What do you got?

08:20.412 --> 08:23.894
A little Social Studies? <i>
¿Un poquito Español?</i>

08:23.938 --> 08:25.592
Are you feeling okay?

08:25.635 --> 08:27.071
I'm fine.

08:27.115 --> 08:29.117
I just wanted to chat
with my daughter.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.292
Okay.

08:30.335 --> 08:31.859
I'm savoring that I get

08:31.902 --> 08:35.776
to be here,
alive and well, for... this.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.477
Still there?

08:41.521 --> 08:44.262
Did you ever tell Gina
how you felt about her?

08:44.306 --> 08:46.482
Oh. No.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.790
I-I dropped plenty of hints,
but no.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.574
No, I didn't want
to ruin the friendship.

08:51.618 --> 08:52.923
Wimp.

08:52.967 --> 08:55.665
I'm not a wimp. I'm patient.

08:55.709 --> 08:57.537
Prudent. Pragmatic.

08:57.580 --> 09:00.888
Pathetic.
Just tell her you're into her.

09:00.931 --> 09:02.803
What's the worst
that could happen?

09:02.846 --> 09:05.588
Well, she rejects me,
never talks to me again,

09:05.632 --> 09:07.155
and then for the rest
of my life, every time

09:07.198 --> 09:09.549
I use her kidney to pee,
I'm reminded of my shame.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.160
I'm sorry I asked.

09:12.203 --> 09:13.640
I'm sorry I answered.

09:13.683 --> 09:14.902
Okay, goodbye.

09:19.254 --> 09:21.343
Hey, look who's back.

09:22.953 --> 09:24.694
It's starting to feel personal.

09:29.917 --> 09:31.701
- Hey, stranger.
I don't know what I'm doing.

09:31.745 --> 09:33.703
I have people here
who are sick and dying

09:33.747 --> 09:37.011
and I don't feel like I'm
equipped to handle any of it.

09:37.054 --> 09:38.534
Well, can you give
the place back?

09:38.578 --> 09:41.102
Did you save the receipt?

09:41.145 --> 09:43.757
Really? I tell you people
are dying and you make jokes?

09:43.800 --> 09:46.716
Can't help it. Death gives me
the heebie-jeebies.

09:46.760 --> 09:47.761
Drew!

09:47.804 --> 09:49.632
Sorry. How can I help?

09:49.676 --> 09:52.983
I have a very sweet lady
who has stage four cancer,

09:53.027 --> 09:55.986
and her husband is angry
and confused,

09:56.030 --> 10:00.077
and I think they need to talk
to a professional.

10:00.121 --> 10:02.558
Oh, and you thought of me.
I'm flattered.

10:02.602 --> 10:05.126
You're the only therapist
I know.

10:05.169 --> 10:07.128
Still flattered.

10:07.171 --> 10:08.869
Okay, I'll stop by tomorrow.

10:08.912 --> 10:10.348
Thanks.

10:13.961 --> 10:16.485
Hey, Roomba. Guess who called.

10:23.057 --> 10:25.015
Norma?

10:25.059 --> 10:27.104
You doing okay?

10:27.148 --> 10:29.019
Go away. I'm fine.

10:29.063 --> 10:31.718
You don't sound fine.
You want to open the door?

10:31.761 --> 10:33.371
No.

10:33.415 --> 10:35.373
I have a pass key.

10:35.417 --> 10:37.506
Come back when you have
a warrant.

10:40.901 --> 10:42.946
What is going on with you?

10:42.990 --> 10:44.644
Nothing.
I'm just having a bad day.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.167
Are you taking your pain meds?

10:46.210 --> 10:47.342
I told you, I don't like

10:47.385 --> 10:48.735
the way they make me feel.

10:48.778 --> 10:50.824
You can't keep
putting off the surgery.

10:50.867 --> 10:52.260
Watch me.

10:52.303 --> 10:53.565
Why are you being so stubborn?

10:56.743 --> 10:59.484
I don't want to be
put under, okay?

10:59.528 --> 11:01.051
They put people my age under,

11:01.095 --> 11:02.705
half the time
they never wake up.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.620
They go from the table to a bag.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.361
Norma, that is not
gonna happen to you.

11:06.404 --> 11:08.276
No pills, no bag.

11:11.758 --> 11:12.715
What are you doing?

11:12.759 --> 11:13.934
Hang on.

11:15.936 --> 11:17.372
What do you need?

11:17.415 --> 11:19.113
Two Advil.

11:19.156 --> 11:20.331
Yeah, like that'll help.

11:20.375 --> 11:21.855
They're for me.

11:23.552 --> 11:25.249
Mind if I sit down for a minute?

11:25.293 --> 11:27.338
The whole place has
gone button-crazy.

11:27.382 --> 11:29.384
Damn it.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.432
Okay, Bette.

11:34.476 --> 11:36.521
Here is your
blood pressure pill.

11:36.565 --> 11:37.827
I'm fine. I don't need it.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.699
Honey, you had a heart attack.

11:39.742 --> 11:40.830
Oh, please.

11:40.874 --> 11:43.659
It was mostly gas.

11:43.703 --> 11:44.878
You have to take your pill.

11:44.921 --> 11:45.966
No.

11:46.009 --> 11:47.184
Okay, fine.

11:47.228 --> 11:48.403
Then no bikini wax.

11:48.446 --> 11:50.579
You're a monster.

11:52.233 --> 11:53.974
- Gideon.
Oh, hey.

11:54.017 --> 11:56.150
- Look who's here.
- Yeah. Gina asked me

11:56.193 --> 11:58.413
to have a little chat
with Meredith and Harry Milton?

11:58.456 --> 12:00.545
Oh, yeah. Down the hall,
uh, second door on the left.

12:00.589 --> 12:03.113
Great. So, how you
liking the new job?

12:03.157 --> 12:06.116
I'm digging it. There's always
something crazy going on.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.162
Hi, Drew.

12:15.691 --> 12:18.563
My wife is sleeping.

12:18.607 --> 12:21.566
Oh, I'm sorry.
Um, I'm Drew Dunbar.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.873
Did Gina tell you
I was gonna drop by?

12:23.917 --> 12:26.441
Oh, yeah. You're the shrink.

12:26.484 --> 12:29.139
I'm actually not a shrink,
I'm a psychologist.

12:29.183 --> 12:31.489
I don't care.
I'm not interested.

12:31.533 --> 12:32.882
Oh, I understand.

12:32.926 --> 12:34.797
I just know
that, sometimes,

12:34.841 --> 12:36.756
when you're going
through difficult situations,

12:36.799 --> 12:38.366
it helps to have someone
to bounce things off of.

12:38.409 --> 12:40.237
Hang on.

12:48.202 --> 12:49.856
You're right. I feel better.

12:55.949 --> 12:58.821
U-Uh, Gina, can you
help me with something?

12:58.865 --> 13:00.823
Oh, can it wait? Uh... I was wondering if we had room

13:00.867 --> 13:02.694
in the budget for
a speaker series.

13:02.738 --> 13:06.002
We could bring people in to
talk to us about world events.

13:06.046 --> 13:08.831
- Ooh, that's a great idea.
- And the occasional magician.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.833
- Oh, you like magic?
- I like to be fooled.

13:10.877 --> 13:12.704
Okay.

13:12.748 --> 13:16.273
A-And I'm thinking that
I could be host/moderator.

13:16.317 --> 13:20.451
Sort of like Charlie Rose,
but before the darkness.

13:20.495 --> 13:21.713
Okay, yeah.
We can make that happen.

13:21.757 --> 13:24.412
Oh, you've just made
an old man very happy.

13:24.455 --> 13:25.717
- I'm glad.
- Uh-- oops.

13:25.761 --> 13:26.980
What's that behind your ear?

13:28.242 --> 13:30.940
Gratitude.

13:30.984 --> 13:33.334
I love that.

13:33.377 --> 13:35.162
Because I fooled you.

13:41.733 --> 13:43.344
It's open.

13:43.387 --> 13:45.912
Hi.

13:45.955 --> 13:47.609
You wanted to see me?

13:47.652 --> 13:50.090
Yes, thank you.

13:50.133 --> 13:52.527
Here, sit.

13:54.094 --> 13:55.269
What's up?

13:55.312 --> 13:57.880
I'm worried about Harry.

13:57.924 --> 13:58.968
Oh, what about him?

13:59.012 --> 14:01.492
He keeps making these
little jokes

14:01.536 --> 14:05.018
that right after my funeral
he's gonna join me in heaven.

14:05.061 --> 14:08.369
Ooh, um, that's not good.

14:08.412 --> 14:11.285
Just know that
the entire staff will make sure

14:11.328 --> 14:13.287
that he has plenty
of emotional support.

14:13.330 --> 14:15.115
I don't care about
the entire staff.

14:15.158 --> 14:16.638
I'm talking to you.

14:16.681 --> 14:20.642
You're the only one here
he actually likes.

14:20.685 --> 14:22.949
I am? Yeah.

14:22.992 --> 14:25.081
You remind him of our daughter.

14:25.125 --> 14:26.822
Aw, that's nice.

14:26.866 --> 14:27.997
Hey, where is she?

14:28.041 --> 14:29.477
In heaven.

14:29.520 --> 14:30.957
Waiting for me.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.872
Oh, Meredith.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.699
I'm so sorry.

14:34.743 --> 14:37.485
So, I can count on you?

14:37.528 --> 14:39.966
Absolutely.

14:40.009 --> 14:42.882
I will take
good care of Harry.

14:42.925 --> 14:45.623
If you don't,
I will haunt you.

14:45.667 --> 14:48.235
Got it.
I mean it.

14:48.278 --> 14:50.454
Sleep with a rosary.

14:52.021 --> 14:55.024
I'll teach you to run from me.

14:59.986 --> 15:01.030
Hey, kidney buddy.

15:01.074 --> 15:02.945
That's getting old, Drew.

15:02.989 --> 15:04.904
Well, you can always give me
another body part.

15:04.947 --> 15:07.036
I bet I could rock your tushy.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.823
Are you flirting with me?

15:11.867 --> 15:14.391
What? Oh, my God. No.

15:14.435 --> 15:16.567
Um, hey, did you talk to Harry?

15:16.611 --> 15:19.440
Yeah, uh, we had a quick chat.
Did not go well.

15:19.483 --> 15:21.355
Did he throw a hush puppy
at you?

15:21.398 --> 15:23.531
No, a water bottle.
What's a hush puppy?

15:23.574 --> 15:25.054
It's a shoe.
For some reason,

15:25.098 --> 15:27.143
old men like to wear them
with shorts.

15:28.188 --> 15:29.145
So, listen.

15:29.189 --> 15:30.494
I talked to his wife today,

15:30.538 --> 15:32.148
and...

15:32.192 --> 15:35.586
she's worried that he might do
something stupid after she dies.

15:35.630 --> 15:38.067
What do you mean, like suicide?

15:38.111 --> 15:41.418
Yeah. She made me promise
to look after him.

15:41.462 --> 15:43.333
That's quite
a responsibility.

15:43.377 --> 15:45.640
Yeah, i-it's actually
way too much for me,

15:45.683 --> 15:49.687
so, um, I'm gonna share it
with my tushy buddy.

15:49.731 --> 15:51.733
Oh, I wish.

15:57.434 --> 15:58.783
Okay, yeah.

15:58.827 --> 16:02.396
I can, uh, swing by tomorrow
and try again.

16:02.439 --> 16:05.051
Hopefully, he won't throw
a water bottle or a shoe at me.

16:05.094 --> 16:06.052
Or a billiard ball.

16:06.095 --> 16:08.271
- What?
- Good night.

16:08.315 --> 16:09.838
Good night.

16:11.622 --> 16:13.276
I love you.

16:15.104 --> 16:16.279
Thank you.

16:16.323 --> 16:17.628
Did you get something fun?

16:17.672 --> 16:20.805
Three-month supply of
my favorite antiaging cream.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.547
You don't just wake up
looking like this.

16:24.548 --> 16:26.159
- Hey, Drew.
- Hey, Gabby.

16:26.202 --> 16:27.943
Hello.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.162
Hi.

16:29.205 --> 16:31.773
Um, I'm looking for Harry.

16:31.816 --> 16:33.644
- Try the game room.
- Thanks.

16:34.645 --> 16:35.864
See ya.

16:35.907 --> 16:37.431
Yes, you will.

16:39.563 --> 16:42.001
Oh. Yum.

16:44.568 --> 16:45.961
Hi, Norma.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.789
- Hi.
- What you doing?

16:47.832 --> 16:49.965
I'm writing an angry letter
to <i>The New York Times.</i>

16:50.009 --> 16:52.098
An actual letter. Wow.

16:52.141 --> 16:55.014
They don't usually get those
unless there's anthrax in them.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.626
- You know what this is?
- A pen?

16:58.669 --> 17:00.280
It's a weapon.

17:00.323 --> 17:02.238
Greatest weapon known to man.

17:02.282 --> 17:05.111
Ah, yes, the whole "pen is
mightier than the sword" thing.

17:05.154 --> 17:06.503
Exactly.
Mm-hmm.

17:06.547 --> 17:08.157
I'm gonna go on a limb and say

17:08.201 --> 17:10.072
you'd get a lot more attention
at <i>The New York Times</i>

17:10.116 --> 17:11.552
if you walked in there
with a sword.

17:12.553 --> 17:14.729
You know what your smart mouth
just got ya?

17:14.772 --> 17:15.817
What's that?

17:15.860 --> 17:17.645
A letter.

17:17.688 --> 17:20.909
See, again I would've gone
with a sword.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.394
Quite the stroke
you got there.

17:28.699 --> 17:31.485
You feel like a little
friendly competition?

17:31.528 --> 17:33.878
- You can actually play?
- Yes.

17:33.922 --> 17:35.489
We had a pool table growing up.

17:35.532 --> 17:37.752
My dad saw it as a way
to spend time with me

17:37.795 --> 17:39.275
without talking.

17:39.319 --> 17:42.148
Sounds like a good father.

17:42.800 --> 17:43.975
All right, grab a stick.
You're up.

17:44.019 --> 17:45.281
Okay.
Come on.

17:48.328 --> 17:49.807
Let's see here.

17:57.641 --> 18:00.340
I'm 84 years old.
Shoot the damn thing.

18:00.383 --> 18:03.604
Sorry, I was taught that
chalking is critical

18:03.647 --> 18:05.606
to avoid any mis... Shoot!

18:05.649 --> 18:08.087
Seems like enough.

18:13.309 --> 18:15.442
Not bad.
Chalking.

18:18.793 --> 18:21.317
So, what about you?
Where'd you learn to play?

18:22.405 --> 18:23.885
Hmm.

18:23.928 --> 18:27.149
At a bar I hung out in,
in college.

18:27.193 --> 18:28.542
Had a table in the back,

18:28.585 --> 18:31.240
and the most beautiful bartender
you've ever seen.

18:31.284 --> 18:34.461
I used to go there
to shoot eight ball,

18:34.504 --> 18:36.854
but really that was just
an excuse just...

18:36.898 --> 18:38.639
just to talk to her, you know.

18:39.814 --> 18:41.946
Nice. Did you get laid?

18:42.991 --> 18:44.819
Yes. Then I married her.

18:45.907 --> 18:47.169
Am I blushing?
I feel like I'm blushing.

18:48.562 --> 18:52.000
I can see why your father
didn't want you to talk.

18:52.043 --> 18:54.742
Ha ha! Funny but painful.

18:57.048 --> 18:58.702
You know, I-I don't know
if Gina mentioned this,

18:58.746 --> 19:00.530
but I was in renal failure,

19:00.574 --> 19:02.184
going to dialysis
three times a week.

19:02.228 --> 19:03.446
It was...

19:03.490 --> 19:05.056
It was pretty bleak.

19:05.100 --> 19:06.884
I came close to giving up.

19:06.928 --> 19:08.451
Okay.

19:08.495 --> 19:10.540
I think I know what this is.

19:10.584 --> 19:11.628
I'm sorry?

19:11.672 --> 19:13.282
What happened? Hmm?

19:13.326 --> 19:14.631
Meredith talked to Gina,

19:14.675 --> 19:16.459
then Gina talked to you,
and that why you're here?

19:16.503 --> 19:20.942
I-I'm not sure about
the exact order of events,

19:20.985 --> 19:24.728
but I do feel

19:24.772 --> 19:26.904
like you and I share a common...

19:26.948 --> 19:29.255
bond, a wound,
if you will.

19:29.298 --> 19:31.170
Uh, could you please
put the ball down?

19:31.213 --> 19:33.128
I'm gonna count to ten.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.869
Ah, and you're holding
the ten ball.

19:34.912 --> 19:36.871
On purpose?
Happy accident?

19:36.914 --> 19:39.221
One. Two.

19:39.265 --> 19:40.353
Okay, I'll wrap it up.

19:40.396 --> 19:42.050
Uh, look.
Three.

19:42.093 --> 19:44.966
What would you do
- if the roles were reversed?
- Four, five, six,

19:45.009 --> 19:47.490
What would you want
Meredith to do?seven, eight...

19:47.534 --> 19:49.013
Wouldn't you want her to live
and be happy?

19:49.057 --> 19:51.842
- Nine.
- I'll circle back tomorrow
for your answer.

19:55.324 --> 19:57.283
Hey, I need
your mailing address.

20:03.027 --> 20:05.769
Madam, would you please
take a card?

20:05.813 --> 20:07.945
- No.
- Why not?

20:07.989 --> 20:09.686
Because I don't know
where they've been

20:09.730 --> 20:11.558
or who's touched them.

20:11.601 --> 20:14.169
Okay. Would anyone else
like to take a card?

20:14.213 --> 20:18.478
I-I will. I'm not afraid
of germs or being delighted.

20:20.654 --> 20:23.787
Ah, the seven of diamonds,
everyone!

20:23.831 --> 20:25.789
Well, now--
you weren't supposed to tell me.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.617
Oh. I'm sorry.

20:27.661 --> 20:29.140
What's wrong with you?

20:29.184 --> 20:31.142
What's wrong with <i>you?</i>

20:31.186 --> 20:32.448
Hey. You know what?

20:32.492 --> 20:33.841
Let-Let's try again.

20:33.884 --> 20:35.625
Okay.

20:35.669 --> 20:39.194
Ah! The three of clubs!

20:39.238 --> 20:42.328
Who saw that coming?

20:42.371 --> 20:44.417
Hey.

20:44.460 --> 20:46.288
You got anything
going on tomorrow?

20:46.332 --> 20:47.637
No, why?

20:47.681 --> 20:49.857
'Cause I thought
we'd shoot some pool.

20:50.901 --> 20:52.425
Yeah, sure. I'd like that.

20:52.468 --> 20:53.774
No talking, just pool.

20:53.817 --> 20:55.863
You got it.
No talking, just chalking.

20:59.345 --> 21:01.738
Is this your card, young lady?

21:01.782 --> 21:04.175
Who cares?
Can you cut me in half?

21:05.351 --> 21:07.788
You know, with all that money,
you could've bought a yacht.

21:07.831 --> 21:10.617
Or a seat in Congress.

21:10.660 --> 21:11.835
Very true.

21:11.879 --> 21:13.228
Any regrets?

21:13.272 --> 21:14.490
Not one.

21:14.534 --> 21:16.275
Harry, put
the shoe down!
