(ambient music)

00:13.179 --> 00:15.949
(ambient music)

00:20.053 --> 00:23.089
(slow piano music)

00:50.083 --> 00:53.019
(orchestra music)

00:57.791 --> 01:00.994
- [Man]
From the very beginning,
cars were designed to be

01:00.994 --> 01:04.197
as powerful and
safe as possible.

01:04.197 --> 01:07.400
And yet, the automobile
remains the most dangerous

01:07.400 --> 01:09.369
vehicle on Earth.

01:09.369 --> 01:12.639
With the Monolith we introduced
a whole new way of thinking.

01:12.639 --> 01:15.975
A car as a completely
safe environment.

01:17.310 --> 01:19.979
(guitar music)

01:21.414 --> 01:24.617
Adamantine nanotech body armor,

01:24.617 --> 01:27.454
ultra thin bullet proof windows.

01:27.454 --> 01:31.424
25 different state of the
art anti-hazard sensors.

01:31.424 --> 01:34.461
Our brand new
exclusive vault mode.

01:35.562 --> 01:38.398
Cars are a place where
most robberies happen.

01:38.398 --> 01:40.633
Where women are
subject to harassment.

01:40.633 --> 01:42.902
So we decided to finally
build the Monolith,

01:42.902 --> 01:46.773
allowing our drivers to
utterly eliminate any risk.

01:46.773 --> 01:50.009
Our Monolith will feature
interactive artificial

01:50.009 --> 01:53.580
intelligence, a live driving
companion and security manager.

01:53.580 --> 01:57.851
Her name is Lilith, you'll
love to get to know her.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.721
All these features make
Monolith quite simply

02:01.721 --> 02:04.390
the safest car ever built,

02:04.390 --> 02:07.260
and the safest place
for you and your family.

02:07.260 --> 02:10.229
(electronic music)

02:31.284 --> 02:34.053
(baby babbling)

02:37.190 --> 02:41.461
- [Woman] Okay, let's find
some music for you, okay.

02:41.461 --> 02:44.330
- [Car Voice] Good
evening, how can I help?

02:44.330 --> 02:48.101
- David, look, we
have a talking car.

02:48.101 --> 02:51.104
- [Car Voice] We haven't
met. My name is Lilith.

02:51.104 --> 02:53.573
What would you like
me to call you?

02:53.573 --> 02:56.876
- I guess just Sandra is fine.

02:56.876 --> 02:59.345
- [Lilith] Justsandra, did
I pronounce that correctly.

02:59.345 --> 03:00.713
(laughing)

03:00.713 --> 03:03.983
- No, there's just,
my name is Sandra.

03:05.885 --> 03:08.988
- [Lilith] Sandra, did I
pronounce that correctly?

03:08.988 --> 03:11.724
- Yes, considering you're a car.

03:12.792 --> 03:13.993
- [Lilith] Hi little
human in the backseat,

03:13.993 --> 03:15.528
what's your name?.

03:15.528 --> 03:18.064
- [Sandra] How do you know
there's a baby in the car?

03:18.064 --> 03:20.500
- [Lilith] According to US
demographics, 30 pound person

03:20.500 --> 03:22.735
is most usually a baby.

03:22.735 --> 03:24.571
- Wow, I'm impressed.

03:25.572 --> 03:26.773
That's David.

03:29.342 --> 03:31.477
- [Lilith] Hello David.

03:31.477 --> 03:33.947
(video game music)

03:33.947 --> 03:37.016
(laughing)

03:37.016 --> 03:40.320
- Hey, Lilith, do you
know how much I weigh too?

03:40.320 --> 03:42.622
- [Lilith] 122.4 pounds.

03:42.622 --> 03:45.458
- Okay, I got it's
that's enough.

03:49.162 --> 03:53.399
- [Sandra] Lilith, do you
store that information

03:53.399 --> 03:54.901
about the weight?

03:54.901 --> 03:56.869
- [Lilith] Of course, for
safety and comfort reasons,

03:56.869 --> 04:00.807
I customize and continuously
improve my interface.

04:00.807 --> 04:03.309
- Have there ever been other
people with different weights

04:03.309 --> 04:05.044
in this car?

04:05.044 --> 04:08.815
- [Lilith] Displaying
latest available data.

04:10.516 --> 04:13.119
- Okay, so, that must be Carl.

04:15.788 --> 04:20.059
Then, that's T. Wayne,
and I guess his girlfriend.

04:22.328 --> 04:25.331
Who's this starving bitch?

04:25.331 --> 04:28.601
- [Lilith] Sandra,
I can't understand.

04:30.069 --> 04:32.338
(sighing)

04:33.072 --> 04:36.175
(car phone beeping)

04:36.943 --> 04:38.711
Incoming call, Carl.

04:41.347 --> 04:44.450
(car phone beeping)

04:52.058 --> 04:53.593
- Look who it is.

04:54.327 --> 04:57.297
- Hey buddy (laughs).

04:57.297 --> 04:58.398
- Daddy.

04:58.398 --> 04:59.799
- [Carl] Oh I miss you.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.634
- So I called you
about a half hour ago.

05:01.634 --> 05:03.436
Guess your phone was
off or something.

05:03.436 --> 05:06.039
- [Carl] Yeah, my batter died.
I forgot my charger.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.240
- Sandra.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.175
- Shh, sweetie,
mom's on the phone.

05:09.175 --> 05:10.443
- [David] Turtle.

05:10.443 --> 05:12.278
- Okay, you want to
play with turtle?

05:12.278 --> 05:15.214
Here's turtle.
Play with turtle, okay.

05:15.214 --> 05:16.983
So how was your flight?

05:16.983 --> 05:19.319
- It was alright.
A lot of turbulence.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.020
They made us keep
our belts buckled

05:21.020 --> 05:23.589
til we got to LA, and
there was this woman.

05:23.589 --> 05:25.024
- Where are you?

05:26.292 --> 05:29.128
Are staying at the hotel
near the airport again?

05:29.128 --> 05:31.831
- I like planes, you're the
one that's afraid of them.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.866
- You like stewardesses.

05:33.866 --> 05:37.737
- Can we talk about the
elephant in the room here?

05:37.737 --> 05:39.939
How's the new car,
do you like it?

05:39.939 --> 05:43.109
- Yeah, I mean the
car is fantastic.

05:43.109 --> 05:45.244
It's just I don't know,
I wasn't really expecting

05:45.244 --> 05:47.080
an armored super car.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.815
I feel like one of your rappers.

05:48.815 --> 05:51.617
- Anything to keep
my little man safe.

05:51.617 --> 05:53.920
I installed the Monolith
app on your phone.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.621
It can control every
function in the car.

05:55.621 --> 05:56.989
Have you tried it?

05:56.989 --> 05:59.425
- I haven't really
tried it much.

05:59.425 --> 06:01.994
My little co-pilot won't let me.

06:01.994 --> 06:04.497
- [Carl] You really shouldn't
let him use your phone, baby.

06:04.497 --> 06:05.732
(laughing)

06:05.732 --> 06:07.633
- It's easy for you to
say when you're hundreds

06:07.633 --> 06:08.501
of miles away.

06:08.501 --> 06:09.669
(door knocking)

06:09.669 --> 06:11.804
- Look, I'm really
sorry baby, I gotta go.

06:11.804 --> 06:15.608
- Sorry Carl, it's just,
it just doesn't feel right.

06:15.608 --> 06:18.010
You being so far
away all the time.

06:18.010 --> 06:19.512
(loud knocking)

06:19.512 --> 06:21.714
- [Carl] They're waiting for
me at the studio to finish the

06:21.714 --> 06:23.883
mix, so I'll call you
when I get done, alright.

06:23.883 --> 06:26.219
- Don't even worry about it.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.821
I'll be asleep by the
time you get home.

06:28.821 --> 06:31.324
- Where are you going?

06:31.324 --> 06:33.159
- Your parents house.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.328
- Poopy, yeah.

06:37.730 --> 06:41.234
- I love you, you
know that right?

06:41.234 --> 06:42.168
- I know.

06:44.437 --> 06:47.840
(electronic music)

06:47.840 --> 06:50.042
Please, please, baby, please.

06:50.042 --> 06:51.744
Shh, it's okay, I'm almost done.

06:51.744 --> 06:53.880
I know, I know.
(baby crying)

06:53.880 --> 06:55.114
It's good okay.

06:55.114 --> 06:56.315
- [Woman] So, you end
up going out last night.

06:56.315 --> 06:57.650
- I should have not have
gone out last night.

06:57.650 --> 06:59.118
- [Woman] Where
did you wonder off?

06:59.118 --> 07:01.020
- [Woman] I didn't even
get that drunk though.

07:01.020 --> 07:02.288
- [Woman] I can't deal with you.

07:02.288 --> 07:03.723
- [Woman] Yeah, where'd you go?

07:03.723 --> 07:06.426
- I hung out with that
guy I came there with,

07:06.426 --> 07:08.528
what do you mean?

07:08.528 --> 07:09.862
- The guy, the for the--

07:09.862 --> 07:10.897
- Yeah, the guy.

07:10.897 --> 07:11.964
- Did you get it done?

07:11.964 --> 07:13.499
- [Woman] Yes you did.

07:13.499 --> 07:14.700
- Okay, fine, wait.

07:14.700 --> 07:15.968
I'll show you.

07:17.570 --> 07:19.005
(laughing)

07:19.005 --> 07:20.740
- What does that say,
is that his name?

07:20.740 --> 07:21.974
- You guys.

07:21.974 --> 07:23.709
- [Woman] Do you have any more?

07:23.709 --> 07:25.178
- No, it's not his name.

07:25.178 --> 07:26.446
- Do we have to check your body?

07:26.446 --> 07:29.215
- No, I'm fine, it's ridiculous.

07:30.516 --> 07:32.351
Let's go.
Harassment.

07:35.254 --> 07:38.224
- God, mommy misses Venice.

07:38.224 --> 07:41.327
But mommy loves her
little boy, yes she does,

07:41.327 --> 07:43.229
yes she does.

07:43.229 --> 07:47.800
Okay, sweetie, this is the last
time before grandmas, okay.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.268
Come on, one, two, three.

07:49.268 --> 07:50.102
(inhaler blowing)

07:50.102 --> 07:51.070
Oh.

07:51.070 --> 07:53.506
(pop music)

08:01.914 --> 08:04.050
(child babbling)

08:04.050 --> 08:06.719
Uh, see what you want.

08:06.719 --> 08:08.588
- It's my marble.

08:08.588 --> 08:09.555
- What?

08:09.555 --> 08:11.157
- It's my marbles.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.358
- You want the marbles?

08:12.358 --> 08:15.194
They're kind of
dangerous, sweetie.

08:15.194 --> 08:16.429
Yeah.

08:16.429 --> 08:17.730
- Yes.

08:17.730 --> 08:18.664
- Okay.

08:21.300 --> 08:22.301
What do you say?

08:22.301 --> 08:23.436
- Thank you.

08:23.436 --> 08:25.571
- Thank you, yes.

08:25.571 --> 08:27.006
Thank you, momma.

08:28.608 --> 08:29.809
Who am I?

08:29.809 --> 08:30.743
- Sandra.

08:32.477 --> 08:33.578
I want this.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.748
- This?

08:35.748 --> 08:36.682
- Yes.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.552
- Okay, cute, let's go.

08:39.552 --> 08:40.653
Hi.

08:40.653 --> 08:41.654
- Hey, how you doing?

08:41.654 --> 08:44.023
Good, just these, and this.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.527
- Your autograph.

09:08.781 --> 09:09.682
- Thank you so much.

09:09.682 --> 09:10.550
- You're welcome.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.551
- Hey, babe, let's go.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.552
- Hey.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.486
- Hi.

09:13.486 --> 09:15.955
- My friend says she knows you.

09:15.955 --> 09:18.224
- I really don't think so.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.093
- You from LA?

09:21.093 --> 09:22.028
- I was.

09:23.095 --> 09:24.597
Now, I live here.

09:25.631 --> 09:27.800
Why am I even telling you this.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.036
- I knew I recognized you.

09:30.036 --> 09:31.737
Your hair looks different.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.806
You're a singer.

09:33.806 --> 09:36.342
- I was a singer, yes.

09:36.342 --> 09:38.044
- Hipstars, right?

09:39.045 --> 09:40.079
- You got me.

09:40.079 --> 09:41.314
- No way.

09:41.314 --> 09:42.782
How's that song go,
the bicycle song?

09:42.782 --> 09:43.883
- Oh, please don't.

09:43.883 --> 09:45.952
- Hipstars, sing with me.

09:45.952 --> 09:47.887
On a bicycle made for two.

09:47.887 --> 09:49.422
- Okay, okay.

09:49.422 --> 09:52.224
- You know what, you should
come party with us tonight.

09:52.224 --> 09:53.926
Amazing place.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.027
Airport One.

09:56.262 --> 09:59.332
What's wrong, are you
here with someone?

09:59.332 --> 10:00.666
- Yeah, my man.

10:02.168 --> 10:03.102
- Uh hmm.

10:04.370 --> 10:06.572
- In the bear suit.

10:06.572 --> 10:08.441
That's my little man.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.542
- You have a kid?

10:09.542 --> 10:10.776
- Uh hmm.

10:10.776 --> 10:13.546
- So he's the one who
shut down Hipstars huh?

10:13.546 --> 10:14.647
- No, I did.

10:16.983 --> 10:18.384
(door bell ringing)

10:18.384 --> 10:20.386
- Guess that's it then.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.889
Later, Hipstars.

10:24.991 --> 10:25.925
- Bye.

10:33.599 --> 10:35.801
Alright, David, let's go.

10:37.069 --> 10:38.004
David?

10:42.141 --> 10:43.075
David?

10:44.910 --> 10:47.480
Have you seen my son.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.914
- No, I haven't.

10:50.683 --> 10:51.617
- David?

10:54.086 --> 10:56.389
David?
(dramatic ambient music)

10:56.389 --> 10:57.556
David, David?

11:02.161 --> 11:03.429
Oh boy, David?

11:05.965 --> 11:07.967
David, are you in here?

11:12.438 --> 11:14.140
David, David, stop.

11:21.180 --> 11:22.381
David, David?

11:25.651 --> 11:28.788
(dramatic ambient music)

11:28.788 --> 11:29.955
David, David.

11:30.856 --> 11:32.024
Oh, sweetie.

11:32.024 --> 11:35.027
- There she is,
there's mom (laughs).

11:35.027 --> 11:36.395
- [Sandra] Hi, sweetie.

11:36.395 --> 11:39.098
- [Woman] You have
got such a cute kid.

11:39.098 --> 11:41.133
- Come here, come here.

11:44.970 --> 11:48.074
Hey, sweetie, you
can't run off, okay.

11:48.074 --> 11:50.042
What did mommy tell you?

11:50.042 --> 11:51.711
You can't go anywhere
like that, okay.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.446
- He's okay, he's a
tough little buddy.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.815
- You guys heard me
screaming, why didn't you

11:55.815 --> 11:57.349
say something?

11:57.349 --> 11:58.684
- Relax, nothing happened
to your child, thanks to us.

11:58.684 --> 12:00.119
- Yeah, you're welcome.

12:00.119 --> 12:02.822
- God, you guys saw me
freaking out.
Are you stupid?

12:02.822 --> 12:04.390
- Yeah, you're welcome.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.025
- Are you freaking stupid,
leaving your child?

12:06.025 --> 12:07.326
- What is she doing?

12:07.326 --> 12:09.729
- He's apparently hating
where you're taking him.

12:09.729 --> 12:10.963
- [Woman] Bye, mommy.

12:10.963 --> 12:13.999
- Have a great day,
dealing with your child.

12:13.999 --> 12:15.601
You should have been
riled up when your child

12:15.601 --> 12:17.470
was running off.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.238
Unfit mother.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.406
(laughing)

12:20.406 --> 12:22.475
(crying)

12:22.475 --> 12:24.143
- David, shut up.

12:24.143 --> 12:26.846
(crying)

12:26.846 --> 12:28.114
It's okay.

12:28.114 --> 12:29.548
- Hey, Hipstar.

12:33.486 --> 12:36.155
- [Woman] She didn't
even say thank you.

12:36.155 --> 12:37.890
- [Man] Hey, Hipstar.

12:37.890 --> 12:40.192
- Got to be fucking kidding me.

12:40.192 --> 12:42.394
- [Lilith] All secure.
Welcome back, Sandra.

12:42.394 --> 12:43.329
David.

12:45.464 --> 12:48.400
(thugs babbling)

12:50.035 --> 12:52.905
(engine revving)

12:54.907 --> 12:56.909
- Hey, that ain't cool.

12:58.544 --> 12:59.812
- [Woman] Run.

13:00.713 --> 13:02.782
Hipstar sucks.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.484
- What the fuck is Hipstar?

13:05.484 --> 13:06.952
You guys are insane.

13:06.952 --> 13:08.621
What is that?

13:08.621 --> 13:11.357
- [Lilith] Would you
like me to drive, Sandra?

13:11.357 --> 13:12.291
- No.

13:15.528 --> 13:18.531
(electronic music)

13:24.804 --> 13:28.340
We were number four on the
top 100, you know that?

13:28.340 --> 13:31.277
We got lots of radio play.

13:31.277 --> 13:33.312
Your mom was good.

13:33.312 --> 13:38.083
Yeah, even though she had to
do all those silly dance moves.

13:38.083 --> 13:39.685
Yeah.

13:39.685 --> 13:41.720
That wasn't bad at all.

13:43.389 --> 13:46.358
Thanks to that song,
I met your dad.

13:46.358 --> 13:49.562
He had another wife,
but he chose me.

13:50.529 --> 13:52.531
I don't regret a thing.

13:53.332 --> 13:56.368
(electronic music)

14:04.543 --> 14:08.480
â™Ş Love's in the air, oh oh oh â™Ş

14:11.183 --> 14:15.020
â™Ş Love's in the air, yeah ah â™Ş

14:18.858 --> 14:22.728
â™Ş Cold in the winter,
sunny on the inside â™Ş

14:22.728 --> 14:23.863
(laughing)

14:23.863 --> 14:26.031
What are you laughing at?

14:32.304 --> 14:34.540
Lilith, call Jessa.

14:34.540 --> 14:37.243
(phone ringing)

14:37.243 --> 14:38.177
Hey, stranger.

14:38.177 --> 14:40.346
- I don't believe it.

14:40.346 --> 14:41.881
What on Earth?

14:41.881 --> 14:44.717
- Oh cut it out, you know
what my life is like now.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.318
Oh, actually you don't but.

14:46.318 --> 14:48.020
- [Jessa] Yeah, sorry.

14:48.020 --> 14:49.255
- Hey, guess what?

14:49.255 --> 14:50.856
I just met these kids
in the middle of nowhere

14:50.856 --> 14:52.258
who remember us.

14:52.258 --> 14:53.959
It brought back some memories.

14:53.959 --> 14:55.961
- Are you having
second thoughts?

14:55.961 --> 14:57.730
- No, don't worry.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.566
So how's the record
coming along?

15:01.533 --> 15:03.636
- [Jessa] Amazing, actually.

15:03.636 --> 15:05.371
Carl saved our asses.

15:05.371 --> 15:06.538
- Carl?

15:06.538 --> 15:07.773
- Don't sweat it.

15:07.773 --> 15:09.308
He just gave us the
name of a guy who does

15:09.308 --> 15:11.210
the arrangements,
fucking genius.

15:11.210 --> 15:13.012
I couldn't even believe it.

15:13.012 --> 15:14.480
I'll have to figure
out a way to thank

15:14.480 --> 15:17.983
your husband properly (laughs).

15:17.983 --> 15:19.919
What are you doing?

15:19.919 --> 15:22.421
- Jesus, Jess,
my son is in the car.

15:22.421 --> 15:23.522
- Oh my god.

15:25.024 --> 15:28.260
Sorry, someone here has
some unfinished business.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.162
Jesus, stop it.

15:30.162 --> 15:34.033
- [Lilith] You have
reached your destination.

15:44.843 --> 15:47.379
- [Jessa] Are you there.

15:47.379 --> 15:48.314
- Yeah.

15:50.582 --> 15:53.352
Hey, how much do you weigh?

15:53.352 --> 15:55.354
- What kind of a
question is that?

15:55.354 --> 15:57.556
- No thanks, sorry,
I was just kidding.

15:57.556 --> 16:00.826
So, who's gonna do lead vocals?

16:00.826 --> 16:02.194
- Who do you think?

16:02.194 --> 16:04.663
Moi.
I mean someone
had to replace you

16:04.663 --> 16:08.867
and it's better me than
some random chick, right?

16:10.135 --> 16:11.937
- Where are you?

16:11.937 --> 16:13.272
- Why?

16:13.272 --> 16:14.840
- Who are you with?

16:14.840 --> 16:16.442
- Why do you care?

16:17.176 --> 16:18.444
- Is it Carl?

16:20.112 --> 16:21.714
- Are you out of your mind?

16:21.714 --> 16:23.682
- Answer me, Jessa, is it Carl?

16:23.682 --> 16:26.752
- No, it's not
fucking Carl, Jesus.

16:26.752 --> 16:28.854
- I know you Jessa,
I know how you are.

16:28.854 --> 16:33.592
You think you can just steal
my life just like that.

16:33.592 --> 16:35.294
- Look, I have to go.

16:35.294 --> 16:37.930
And for the record, I'm not
the one screwing your husband.

16:37.930 --> 16:39.431
- What do you mean?

16:39.431 --> 16:41.200
What the fuck do
you mean, Jessa?

16:41.200 --> 16:43.068
Who's screwing Carl?

16:43.068 --> 16:44.236
Jessa, bitch.

16:51.510 --> 16:55.280
(phone busy signal ringing)

17:02.554 --> 17:05.324
(phone ringing)

17:14.433 --> 17:16.268
- [Carl] Hi, you've
reached Carl Jenkins.

17:16.268 --> 17:19.738
- Fuck, David,
stop, David, stop.

17:19.738 --> 17:21.205
- [Carl] I'm locked
in the studio.

17:21.205 --> 17:23.142
I'll call you back,
just leave a message.

17:23.142 --> 17:24.542
(crying)

17:24.542 --> 17:27.980
- Okay, sweetheart,
everything's fine.

17:27.980 --> 17:31.250
Sorry, fucking marbles,
I wasn't thinking.

17:31.250 --> 17:32.751
(crying)

17:32.751 --> 17:35.521
Okay (exhales).

17:43.529 --> 17:47.800
- [Lilith]
New destination set.

17:49.635 --> 17:53.605
Calculating route
for new destination.

17:53.605 --> 17:56.475
(engine revving)

18:02.514 --> 18:04.083
- Daddy.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.685
- Okay, let's try daddy again.

18:10.622 --> 18:13.525
(phone ringing)

18:13.525 --> 18:15.461
Pick up for fuck sake.

18:20.232 --> 18:21.333
- [David] Daddy.

18:21.333 --> 18:23.001
- I get it.

18:23.001 --> 18:24.603
- [Carl] Hi, you've
reached Carl Jenkins.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.105
- Okay, there's no daddy.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.539
- [Carl] I just purposely sent
your call to your voicemail.

18:27.539 --> 18:28.540
Just kidding.

18:28.540 --> 18:29.708
- Play with turtle, okay.

18:29.708 --> 18:31.376
- [Carl] I'm locked
in the studio.

18:31.376 --> 18:32.911
I'll call you back,
leave a message.

18:32.911 --> 18:34.113
- Hang in there, sweetie.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.882
Daddy's gonna be really
surprised to see us.

18:36.882 --> 18:39.918
(soft piano music)

18:44.556 --> 18:46.458
- [Lilith] There's an
accident on the freeway.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.460
Delays to be expected.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.996
- No, no, no. I don't want
to get stuck on the freeway.

18:50.996 --> 18:52.865
- [Lilith] Would you like
to change the itinerary?

18:52.865 --> 18:56.034
- Let's just take
the quickest route.

19:00.472 --> 19:03.308
- [Lilith] Left turn,
1,000 feet.

19:04.543 --> 19:07.579
(soft piano music)

19:25.397 --> 19:27.399
- [Sandra] Are you sure
that's the right road?

19:27.399 --> 19:29.001
- [Lilith] This is the
shortest route to avoid

19:29.001 --> 19:30.235
traffic jam.

19:30.235 --> 19:33.372
We will resume the
freeway in 50 miles.

19:34.439 --> 19:36.608
Relax and enjoy the view.

19:39.278 --> 19:42.314
(electronic music)

19:44.116 --> 19:47.519
Don't forget Sandra, I can
drive when you are tired.

19:47.519 --> 19:51.223
- [Sandra] Lilith, thank you,
but I think I can do this

19:51.223 --> 19:52.157
on my own.

19:56.995 --> 19:59.998
(soft piano music)

20:08.073 --> 20:10.943
(engine revving)

20:14.313 --> 20:17.249
Oh, finally a sign of life.

20:17.249 --> 20:20.519
Maybe we can stop
and get some drinks.

20:25.691 --> 20:28.193
(sighing)

20:28.193 --> 20:29.127
Never mind.

20:42.307 --> 20:44.676
(loud howling)

20:47.980 --> 20:50.515
(rock music)

21:12.704 --> 21:16.375
Sorry sweetie, mommy's
just really nervous.

21:21.680 --> 21:24.283
(car beeping)

21:26.518 --> 21:27.853
What is going on?

21:27.853 --> 21:29.655
- [Lilith] Warning,
smoke detected.

21:29.655 --> 21:31.990
Park safely, and
please evacuate.

21:31.990 --> 21:32.924
- Fuck.

21:35.427 --> 21:36.862
Gotta be kidding me.

21:36.862 --> 21:39.064
- [Lilith] Warning,
smoke detected.

21:39.064 --> 21:41.533
- Yeah, because I'm smoking.

21:41.533 --> 21:44.136
Can you make the noise stop?

21:44.136 --> 21:46.672
- [Lilith] Sandra,
I can't understand.

21:46.672 --> 21:48.607
- Turn off that noise.

21:50.042 --> 21:52.144
- [Lilith] Do you want
to switch to full manual?

21:52.144 --> 21:53.712
- Yes.

21:53.712 --> 21:55.981
- [Lilith] This will turn
off all assisted features.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.482
Do you wish to continue?

21:57.482 --> 22:00.752
- It's just a stupid cigarette
and I opened the window.

22:00.752 --> 22:03.388
- [Lilith] Sandra,
I can't under...

22:03.388 --> 22:06.758
(car computer beeping)

22:12.197 --> 22:14.599
(coughing)

22:14.599 --> 22:15.534
- Shit.

22:16.568 --> 22:18.170
Happy now, Lilith?

22:20.706 --> 22:22.874
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

22:22.874 --> 22:26.144
Mommy knows it's bad to smoke.

22:26.144 --> 22:28.980
Today, she just
really needed it.

22:32.651 --> 22:35.587
I'll never do it again, okay.

22:35.587 --> 22:37.155
(loud banging)

22:37.155 --> 22:40.192
(tires screeching)

22:42.761 --> 22:45.864
(crickets chirping)

22:46.932 --> 22:49.768
(animal moaning)

22:54.673 --> 22:58.410
Are you okay?
Are you hurt, are you hurt?

22:58.410 --> 23:01.580
Okay good (gasping).

23:04.416 --> 23:06.651
Come on, no, sweetie, okay.

23:06.651 --> 23:07.853
You want turtle?

23:07.853 --> 23:08.687
- Yeah.

23:08.687 --> 23:09.921
- Where is it?

23:10.922 --> 23:13.825
I'll get it for you.
(child crying)

23:13.825 --> 23:17.429
Oh please don't cry
baby, please, don't
cry, please, please.

23:17.429 --> 23:18.797
Okay, it's okay.

23:18.797 --> 23:22.167
Here look, look
it's turtle, okay.

23:22.167 --> 23:24.136
Play with turtle.

23:24.136 --> 23:26.972
(animal moaning)

23:29.775 --> 23:30.709
Okay.

23:33.278 --> 23:36.748
I'm gonna go check outside
okay, just give me a minute.

23:36.748 --> 23:38.517
And then we'll get going.

23:38.517 --> 23:39.785
Okay, alright.

23:41.653 --> 23:44.322
(door beeping)

23:45.090 --> 23:47.793
(child crying)

23:49.327 --> 23:52.197
(animal moaning)

23:53.465 --> 23:55.300
Holy shit, oh my god.

24:00.005 --> 24:02.707
(child crying)

24:17.222 --> 24:20.225
Don't be scared,
baby, mommy's here.

24:22.794 --> 24:25.230
Just play with turtle, okay.

24:36.308 --> 24:40.412
Give me a break.
(door shutting)

25:07.305 --> 25:11.009
(suspenseful ambient music)

25:28.193 --> 25:30.962
(doors locking)

25:33.832 --> 25:36.468
(suspenseful music)

25:36.468 --> 25:38.136
No, no, no, no, no.

25:43.041 --> 25:43.875
Ah, ah.

25:43.875 --> 25:46.745
(window closing)

25:50.549 --> 25:51.883
Oh god, no, no.

25:54.185 --> 25:55.120
No.

25:58.590 --> 25:59.524
No, no.

26:01.192 --> 26:02.127
David.

26:05.330 --> 26:09.100
What did you do?

26:09.100 --> 26:11.736
What did you touch,
what did you push?

26:11.736 --> 26:13.505
Don't, don't, don't.

26:16.174 --> 26:17.976
Be a good boy.

26:17.976 --> 26:19.578
Show me the phone.

26:22.180 --> 26:23.882
Good boy, good boy.

26:25.884 --> 26:27.752
I'm very proud of you.

26:27.752 --> 26:31.823
Sweetie, you just have to
listen to what I say, okay.

26:31.823 --> 26:35.427
Take your finger and
do this on the phone.

26:36.761 --> 26:39.030
Go like this on the phone.

26:40.098 --> 26:43.535
No, like the other,
like this, like this.

26:46.237 --> 26:50.175
David, put your finger on
the phone, and do this.

26:50.175 --> 26:51.610
Like, like this.

26:53.778 --> 26:55.547
Like this, no, like.

26:57.048 --> 26:59.651
David, no watch me, like this.

27:00.685 --> 27:03.622
Put your finger on
the phone and do this.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.256
No, David, look at me.

27:05.256 --> 27:09.694
David, look at me, watch.
Like this, like that.

27:09.694 --> 27:10.662
Look at me.

27:16.501 --> 27:19.604
David, do this with
your finger now.

27:21.339 --> 27:23.274
No, David, what, what.

27:25.210 --> 27:29.614
Oh my god, no.
(dramatic electronic music)

27:29.614 --> 27:32.283
(loud gasping)

27:38.089 --> 27:39.391
Oh my god.

27:39.391 --> 27:40.325
Help!

27:41.626 --> 27:42.560
Help!

27:45.363 --> 27:47.298
Somebody help, please.

27:52.404 --> 27:56.174
(suspenseful ambient music)

28:00.812 --> 28:04.416
Hey, Lilith, it's Sandra,
can you hear me?

28:09.320 --> 28:11.890
Lilith, I'm locked out.

28:11.890 --> 28:14.726
My baby is locked
inside the car.

28:16.394 --> 28:18.663
Lilith, it's an emergency.

28:21.199 --> 28:22.801
It's an emergency.

28:23.668 --> 28:25.704
You stupid fucking car.

28:28.073 --> 28:30.075
Lilith, open the doors.

28:31.776 --> 28:33.912
Unlock the doors.

28:33.912 --> 28:35.080
Do something.

28:36.881 --> 28:39.818
Uh.
(loud slapping)

28:39.818 --> 28:42.320
Stay calm, you're just a car.

28:46.191 --> 28:49.194
Uh.
(loud smacking)

28:50.762 --> 28:53.031
(wincing)

28:58.603 --> 29:00.872

29:02.974 --> 29:05.910

29:39.811 --> 29:42.180

30:03.067 --> 30:05.236
(crying)

30:10.942 --> 30:13.745
(loud smacking)

30:15.180 --> 30:17.849
(child crying)

30:20.318 --> 30:21.319
Fuck, Carl.

30:26.024 --> 30:26.958
Fuck you.

30:27.926 --> 30:30.695
(alarm ringing)

30:34.566 --> 30:36.901
I have to go look for help.

30:37.936 --> 30:40.138
Mommy will be right back.

30:43.608 --> 30:46.544
(heavy breathing)

30:50.215 --> 30:52.383
(crying)

30:59.057 --> 31:00.058
Peek-a-boo.

31:06.431 --> 31:08.066
Peek-a-boo.

31:08.066 --> 31:10.368
(laughing)

31:11.135 --> 31:13.271
(piano music)

31:13.271 --> 31:14.305
Peek-a-boo.

31:16.908 --> 31:20.678
I know you've never
been left alone before.

31:20.678 --> 31:24.449
I'm gonna get help and
I'll be back so soon.

31:25.216 --> 31:27.218
I'm gonna get you out of there.

31:27.218 --> 31:29.487
This whole thing will be
over before you know it.

31:29.487 --> 31:31.422
Okay.

31:32.190 --> 31:34.525
(sniffing)

31:35.460 --> 31:38.496
(soft piano music)

32:00.852 --> 32:02.553
Is something there?

32:08.393 --> 32:11.095
(ambient music)

32:14.799 --> 32:15.733
Help.

32:18.970 --> 32:19.904
Help.

32:22.073 --> 32:23.007
Hello?

32:27.078 --> 32:30.248
Help.
(gate rattling)

32:31.516 --> 32:32.450
Hello.

32:34.485 --> 32:37.322

32:37.322 --> 32:38.256
Hello.

32:47.865 --> 32:50.735

(grunting)

33:10.188 --> 33:11.122
Ah.

33:12.357 --> 33:13.291
Uh.

33:14.292 --> 33:15.226
Shit.

33:17.595 --> 33:20.264
(door opening)

33:32.777 --> 33:33.745
(phone ringing)

33:33.745 --> 33:34.912
Hello, hello?

33:37.115 --> 33:40.718
- [Woman] Hello, you've
reached American Electric

33:40.718 --> 33:42.687
Power powering the
American dream.

33:42.687 --> 33:44.155
Welcome to customer assistance.

33:44.155 --> 33:45.423
Hi, thank god.

33:47.358 --> 33:50.194
I had an accident and my
son is locked in the car.

33:50.194 --> 33:51.396
I need help.

33:51.396 --> 33:53.431
- [Woman] All of our
offices are closed until

33:53.431 --> 33:54.732
Tuesday, July 5th.

33:54.732 --> 33:56.434
From all of us at AEP....

33:56.434 --> 33:57.435
- No, what?

33:57.435 --> 33:59.937
- [Woman]
...happy Independence Day.

33:59.937 --> 34:03.341
Hello, you've reached--
Hello, you've reached--

34:03.341 --> 34:04.342
- No, no.

34:04.342 --> 34:05.343
Fuck.

34:05.343 --> 34:07.578
(loud smacking)

34:07.578 --> 34:10.447
(heavy breathing)

34:26.130 --> 34:27.065
Ugh.

34:32.003 --> 34:34.371
(grunting)

34:57.495 --> 35:01.265
(suspenseful ambient music)

35:06.204 --> 35:09.140
(animal growling)

35:28.392 --> 35:31.162
(crickets chirping)
(ambient music)

35:31.162 --> 35:32.096
- Sandra.

35:48.980 --> 35:49.914
Sandra.

35:54.452 --> 35:56.154
- David, it's okay.

35:57.388 --> 36:00.324
(heavy breathing)

36:16.741 --> 36:21.012
(dog barking)
(suspenseful ambient music)

36:26.984 --> 36:29.754
(Sandra yelling)

36:31.789 --> 36:34.559
(alarm ringing)

36:54.612 --> 36:57.215
David, just stay calm, please.

36:57.215 --> 36:58.583
David, breathe.

37:02.320 --> 37:04.755
You can breathe on your own.

37:12.863 --> 37:15.299
Mommy just worries too much.

37:16.334 --> 37:18.436
Even the doctor says so.

37:19.470 --> 37:23.140
Show me how good you
can breathe on your own.

37:25.876 --> 37:28.079
(crying)

37:39.924 --> 37:42.693
(ambient music)

37:44.695 --> 37:48.532
Sleep well, baby, it'll
all be over tomorrow.

38:16.227 --> 38:20.498
(wind blowing)
(dramatic piano music)

39:02.740 --> 39:04.575
Stay calm, stay calm.

39:05.409 --> 39:07.445
It's all gonna be okay.

39:09.513 --> 39:11.882
Carl's gonna come find us.

39:11.882 --> 39:15.319
I mean, he must have
called home by now.

39:16.721 --> 39:19.423
Although I did tell him not to.

39:25.229 --> 39:26.831
He'll call anyway.

39:28.132 --> 39:31.435
He'll be worried about us and
he'll come looking for us.

39:31.435 --> 39:33.037
I mean, he has to.

39:38.008 --> 39:39.610
Or maybe he won't.

39:41.712 --> 39:45.716
This might be the perfect
way to get rid of us.

40:01.899 --> 40:03.000
David, look.

40:04.402 --> 40:06.270
It's a shooting star.

40:10.307 --> 40:11.242
I wish.

40:15.546 --> 40:16.680
Oh.

40:16.680 --> 40:18.716
It's just a plane.

40:18.716 --> 40:20.484
(laughing)

40:20.484 --> 40:21.919
Of course it is.

40:28.159 --> 40:29.260
Airport One.

40:41.305 --> 40:43.974
Oh my god, there's
an airport nearby.

40:43.974 --> 40:44.909
David.

40:45.976 --> 40:46.911
David.

40:50.214 --> 40:51.148
David?

40:58.656 --> 40:59.824
David, David.

41:05.796 --> 41:07.665
David, where are you?

41:09.600 --> 41:10.501
David?

41:13.838 --> 41:14.772
David?

41:15.606 --> 41:17.441
David, where are you?

41:36.126 --> 41:38.429
David.

41:41.065 --> 41:43.634
Sweetie, hi sweetheart.

41:43.634 --> 41:46.737
David, it's okay,
everything's okay.

41:52.309 --> 41:55.880
David, unzip your
suit, can you do that?

41:55.880 --> 41:58.182
Can you unzip your
suit a little bit.

41:58.182 --> 42:01.952
Sweetie, your bear suit,
try to unzip, please.

42:01.952 --> 42:03.988
Just try, David.

42:03.988 --> 42:07.091
It's okay, it's okay,
everything's okay.

42:07.091 --> 42:08.692
I fucked up again.

42:09.627 --> 42:12.329
Mommy has a gift for fucking up.

42:13.397 --> 42:15.466
But I know what
I'm gonna do now.

42:15.466 --> 42:17.535
There's an airport
nearby and I'm sure

42:17.535 --> 42:19.537
there's someone there
that can help us.

42:19.537 --> 42:20.971
Okay.

42:20.971 --> 42:23.541
(heavy breathing)

42:23.541 --> 42:24.475
Oh god.

42:34.084 --> 42:35.019
Okay.

42:36.654 --> 42:37.588
Okay.

42:38.656 --> 42:40.457
Let's get you some shade, okay.

42:44.361 --> 42:47.464
Okay, sweetie, mommy has
to go now, but I'm gonna

42:47.464 --> 42:49.266
come back with some help.

42:49.266 --> 42:50.267
- Don't go.

42:51.835 --> 42:53.070
Don't go.

42:53.070 --> 42:54.104
- Sweetie.

42:54.104 --> 42:55.973
- I'll get the phone.

42:58.776 --> 43:00.411
I get the phone.

43:00.411 --> 43:02.580
- There's no use,
just stay still, please.

43:02.580 --> 43:04.181
- I get the phone.

43:07.051 --> 43:10.588
- I know you're scared
in there all alone.

43:11.689 --> 43:13.891
(crying)

43:17.328 --> 43:20.764
I know it's tough but
you've got to be a big boy.

43:20.764 --> 43:24.868
You've got to be brave,
you've got to be strong.

43:24.868 --> 43:27.571
(child crying)

43:35.379 --> 43:39.249
(dramatic synthesizer music)

44:28.332 --> 44:29.867
Oh god.

44:29.867 --> 44:34.538
You're gonna have a story to
tell when all this is done.

44:34.538 --> 44:37.541
All your friends when you
go to kindergarten are gonna

44:37.541 --> 44:41.812
think you're so cool 'cause you
spent a night in the desert.

44:43.681 --> 44:44.615
Oh my god.

44:47.484 --> 44:48.652
I need water.

44:50.054 --> 44:50.988
Okay.

44:58.462 --> 45:00.731
If I'd been a fucking girl
scout, I'd know how to get

45:00.731 --> 45:02.499
water in the desert.

45:04.868 --> 45:09.139
When you're older, I'm gonna
make sure you go to boy scouts.

45:13.711 --> 45:15.746
When you're old enough.

45:18.716 --> 45:20.718
When you're old enough.

45:22.986 --> 45:25.923
(heavy breathing)

45:38.235 --> 45:41.638
(ambient music)

45:41.638 --> 45:42.573
Water.

45:45.509 --> 45:46.443
Water.

45:58.822 --> 46:01.158
(laughing)

46:02.626 --> 46:05.395
(water rushing)

46:09.032 --> 46:11.335
(spitting)

46:15.005 --> 46:17.941
(heavy breathing)

46:24.281 --> 46:28.385
Okay.
(dramatic orchestra music)

46:37.528 --> 46:39.363
God, how far is this?

46:44.935 --> 46:48.605
(dramatic orchestra music)

47:12.796 --> 47:15.332
(laughing)

47:15.332 --> 47:16.266
Yes, yes.

47:19.636 --> 47:21.972
(laughing)

47:41.792 --> 47:42.726
Help.

47:49.399 --> 47:50.434
What is it?

48:01.078 --> 48:02.012
Help.

48:03.647 --> 48:05.582
Help, is anyone there?

49:31.435 --> 49:32.703
What the fuck?

49:52.089 --> 49:54.958
(metal creaking)

50:17.581 --> 50:20.617
(curtain flapping)

50:28.625 --> 50:30.894
(gulping)

50:39.403 --> 50:42.172
(ambient music)

51:35.158 --> 51:37.761
(piano music)

51:43.967 --> 51:46.303
(grunting)

52:07.057 --> 52:09.826
(water rushing)

52:24.508 --> 52:27.878
(ambient chorus music)

53:55.599 --> 53:57.100
Oh my god, oh my god.

53:57.100 --> 53:58.301
David, David.

54:01.705 --> 54:06.543
David, answer me, David.
(tapping)

54:06.543 --> 54:08.044
Oh shit, oh shit.

54:12.983 --> 54:15.352
(grunting)

54:17.153 --> 54:20.090
(heavy breathing)

54:38.408 --> 54:39.409
David, hey.

54:43.213 --> 54:46.750
It must be a little
cool in there, right?

54:46.750 --> 54:49.686
(heavy breathing)

54:59.829 --> 55:02.165
(grunting)

55:31.261 --> 55:33.330
Open dammit, open.

55:33.330 --> 55:35.665
You make such a mess
over a cigarette

55:35.665 --> 55:37.167
and this doesn't even phase you.

55:37.167 --> 55:40.503
(car computer beeping)

55:44.641 --> 55:45.575
Oh my god.

55:48.178 --> 55:50.046
Oh my god, oh my god.

55:58.221 --> 56:01.157
(heavy breathing)

56:18.808 --> 56:22.512
(dramatic orchestra music)

57:09.359 --> 57:12.061
(loud grunting)

57:26.776 --> 57:29.479
(loud banging)

57:42.892 --> 57:43.827
Ah.

57:55.405 --> 57:58.341
(woman screaming)

58:07.317 --> 58:10.053
(loud grunting)

58:19.929 --> 58:23.566
(heavy breathing)

58:23.566 --> 58:24.601
Go to hell.

58:44.721 --> 58:47.390
(wind blowing)

59:15.218 --> 59:18.221
(slow piano music)

59:42.478 --> 59:44.647
(crying)

59:47.483 --> 59:48.685
David.

59:48.685 --> 59:49.619
My love.

59:55.358 --> 59:58.494
- [Carl] We shouldn't
have come here.

59:58.494 --> 01:00:00.263
- It was a mistake.

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:01.698
- [Carl] Get up.

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:02.632
- No, no.

01:00:08.471 --> 01:00:12.241
- You know what happened,
and you know when.

01:00:21.851 --> 01:00:25.021
- I was just trying
to keep him safe.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.528
Just wanted to stay calm.

01:00:34.897 --> 01:00:37.066
- You know why he's gone?

01:00:44.707 --> 01:00:47.443
- I just wanted a cigarette.

01:00:47.443 --> 01:00:51.047
I was going crazy that
day because of you.

01:00:56.519 --> 01:00:58.521
This is all your fault.

01:01:03.526 --> 01:01:05.061
- Really, Sandra?

01:01:06.896 --> 01:01:07.830
My fault.

01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:10.900
You know what happened here.

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:13.569
And if there's anyone to blame,

01:01:15.304 --> 01:01:16.239
it's you.

01:01:19.809 --> 01:01:21.344
- I didn't do this.

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:22.612
- Yes you did.

01:01:23.646 --> 01:01:25.415
- It isn't my fault.

01:01:26.949 --> 01:01:28.718
I didn't want this.

01:01:28.718 --> 01:01:32.555
- This is all your fault,
you took my boy.

01:01:32.555 --> 01:01:33.923
You killed him.

01:01:35.058 --> 01:01:36.793
- I didn't want this,
no, I didn't want this.

01:01:36.793 --> 01:01:37.727
- Say it.

you were in my belly.
