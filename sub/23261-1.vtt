WEBVTT

00:28.720 --> 00:30.720
(LIVELY CHATTER)

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
OK, lads.
Cheers, mate.

00:43.600 --> 00:45.439
Where on earth have they got to?

00:45.479 --> 00:47.479
They'll be here.

00:54.920 --> 00:57.560
"The number you have dialled
is currently unavailable."

00:57.600 --> 00:59.600
(BEEPING)

01:05.439 --> 01:07.439
(ALARM BLARES)

01:12.400 --> 01:14.400
All right, shut it down.

01:19.759 --> 01:21.759
Get that kiln open!

02:31.000 --> 02:32.959
Ma'am.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.600
They found the body
in one of the incinerators.

02:36.319 --> 02:38.319
No idea who it is.

02:39.479 --> 02:41.119
Who's in charge?

02:41.159 --> 02:44.159
Abattoir Manager. Iain Hobswain.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.439
Right. Let's see
what we're dealing with.

02:51.439 --> 02:53.000
Where is he?

02:53.039 --> 02:54.639
Other end of the plant.

02:54.680 --> 02:56.680
Just follow your nose.

03:11.639 --> 03:13.639
What time do you call this?

03:13.680 --> 03:15.680
Stone the crows.

03:15.720 --> 03:18.000
He's back from his secondment.

03:18.039 --> 03:21.600
Bet you've been counting the days.
Yeah, don't flatter yourself.

03:22.920 --> 03:24.920
What can you tell us, Marcus?

03:26.759 --> 03:28.720
Male. Average build.

03:28.759 --> 03:32.519
Got flexion of the elbows,
knees and neck

03:32.560 --> 03:34.560
typical of severely burned bodies.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.879
I'd put his height at around 175.

03:38.560 --> 03:39.720
Age?

03:41.159 --> 03:43.039
Rough guess.

03:43.079 --> 03:45.720
It's amalgam fillings
so suggests he was middle-aged.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.759
And there's this.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.000
A wedding ring.

03:54.079 --> 03:56.000
And that's about all
I can tell you for now.

03:56.039 --> 03:58.039
So no chance of an ID?

03:58.079 --> 04:01.680
Well, we might get a profile
from the marrow in one of these
long bones.

04:01.720 --> 04:03.920
But I wouldn't hold out much hope.

04:03.959 --> 04:05.920
Heat does bad things to DNA.

04:05.959 --> 04:07.959
What about injuries other than...

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
High temperature
thermal incineration

04:11.039 --> 04:13.959
makes it difficult
to determine the cause of death.

04:14.360 --> 04:16.400
Postmortem might
give us some more answers.

04:16.439 --> 04:20.360
Right. Meantime,
I want your team all over this.

04:20.400 --> 04:23.000
Prints, bloodstains, the lot.

04:23.039 --> 04:25.759
Uh...ma'am, it IS an abattoir.

04:25.800 --> 04:28.479
Yeah, well, think of it
as a challenge, Marcus.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Mr Hobswain?

04:40.159 --> 04:43.680
I'm DCI Stanhope.
I'm running the investigation.

04:45.079 --> 04:48.000
That must have knocked you for six
when you found him.

04:48.039 --> 04:51.519
If we hadn't had that power outage,
he would've been bonemeal.

04:51.560 --> 04:53.759
Body's unrecognisable .
Aye, I saw it.

04:54.759 --> 04:58.119
Mm. So we're gonna have to rule
him out as one of your employees.

04:58.159 --> 05:00.319
He's not. Well, he wasn't.

05:00.360 --> 05:01.879
Well, how can you be sure?

05:03.159 --> 05:04.639
He's not one of ours.

05:04.680 --> 05:07.639
And how did he end up
in one of your kilns?

05:07.680 --> 05:09.039
I've no idea.

05:09.079 --> 05:12.119
Look, I run a reputable business.

05:12.159 --> 05:13.920
And right now, it's losing money.

05:13.959 --> 05:16.759
Well, the sooner
you show us around the premises,

05:16.800 --> 05:19.119
the sooner you'll be
back up and running.

05:22.879 --> 05:25.159
Stunning, bleeding and hoisting.

05:25.200 --> 05:28.479
Any waste we can use gets
rendered down. The rest is burned.

05:28.519 --> 05:31.039
Slaughter halls
are run to FSA regulations.

05:31.920 --> 05:34.280
Clean and dirty areas
to avoid contamination.

05:34.319 --> 05:36.959
So it would be hard to hide a body.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
He didn't come through here.
Mm.

05:39.039 --> 05:41.039
What about deliveries?

05:42.519 --> 05:44.759
Around half our ABPs
come in from outside.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.400
Incinerated on site.

05:46.439 --> 05:49.079
AIDEN: ABPs?
Animal By-Products.

05:49.119 --> 05:51.959
Factory waste, fallen livestock.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.400
If they've got the right paperwork,
we'll burn it.

05:54.439 --> 05:57.039
Leading edge facility.
Automated handling.

05:57.959 --> 06:01.000
So it would be possible for
a body to come through undetected?

06:01.039 --> 06:03.639
All our deliveries
are stringently checked.

06:03.680 --> 06:06.360
Industry standard
for best working practice.

06:07.239 --> 06:10.800
I'm going to need names and
addresses of everyone who works here.

06:10.839 --> 06:12.560
Porters, butchers, the lot.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.959
And a list of your current suppliers.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.439
Well, that's gonna take a while.

06:16.479 --> 06:18.680
Well, you'd better get on with it,
then.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.879
It's got to be an inside job.

06:24.920 --> 06:26.680
Somebody who knows the set-up.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.159
Well, he's got deliveries
coming in from all over.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.680
That body could have
come in from anywhere.

06:32.319 --> 06:35.039
Right, get the team in
for a briefing.

06:35.079 --> 06:38.519
I'm gasping for a cup of tea
and a bacon sandwich.

06:40.119 --> 06:43.519
Male, adult.
We're guessing middle-aged.

06:43.560 --> 06:46.639
Burned to a crisp
in an abattoir incinerator.

06:46.680 --> 06:49.479
No ID,
no established time of death.

06:49.519 --> 06:52.720
We think the body went into the
furnace at 6pm yesterday evening.

06:52.759 --> 06:55.119
They're inspected
at the start of every shift.

06:55.159 --> 06:57.680
Yeah, but we've only got
their word for that.

06:58.959 --> 07:01.280
The shift workers
are all accounted for.

07:02.800 --> 07:05.519
So either he was killed
on a visit to the premises

07:05.560 --> 07:07.839
or the body was brought
in from outside.

07:07.879 --> 07:09.479
I've been on to Missing Persons.

07:09.519 --> 07:11.360
No-one flagged up
as reported missing.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.439
Well, this fella's
wearing a wedding ring

07:13.479 --> 07:15.839
So let's assume he was married.

07:15.879 --> 07:18.920
The only camera on site was
in the incinerator loading bay.

07:18.959 --> 07:21.439
What, no surveillance anywhere else?

07:21.479 --> 07:22.959
No.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Hm!

07:25.639 --> 07:28.439
Anyone would think
they'd got something to hide.

07:29.280 --> 07:33.159
Yeah, well, Brenkley was fined
five years ago by Trading Standards.

07:33.800 --> 07:37.439
Iain Hobswain was found guilty
of illegal horse meat sales

07:37.479 --> 07:39.600
and failure to keep proper records.

07:39.639 --> 07:42.360
Was he?
Yeah. Four months suspended.

07:44.400 --> 07:47.079
Well, maybe he
still hasn't cleaned up his act.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.439
Kenny, I want to know
what's on that footage.

07:51.479 --> 07:53.479
Pick-ups, deliveries.
Ma'am.

07:54.759 --> 07:58.119
What's he really been up to
on those night shifts?

08:00.800 --> 08:03.479
Fractures in both legs.
Probably post mortem.

08:04.839 --> 08:06.560
The muscles and tendons are charred,

08:06.600 --> 08:10.400
resulting in the exposure
of the underlying bones to heat.

08:10.439 --> 08:12.319
He was definitely dead
before he went in.

08:12.360 --> 08:14.360
Well, that's something.

08:14.400 --> 08:17.119
And you know that because?
No soot in the airway.

08:18.280 --> 08:21.000
And you're still none the wiser,
cause of death?

08:22.200 --> 08:24.200
Ante mortem gunshot wound.

08:24.239 --> 08:26.519
One shot, close range,
back of the head.

08:27.159 --> 08:30.479
He was shot?
Mm-hm. 7.65mm ammunition.

08:30.519 --> 08:33.519
It was a lucky find
considering the state of the body.

08:33.879 --> 08:38.159
Marcus, get that bullet over
to ballistics as quick as you can
for testing.

08:39.639 --> 08:40.720
Time of death?

08:40.759 --> 08:43.159
The gut and intestines
are still reasonably intact.

08:43.200 --> 08:45.600
I'd say they were shielded
from the worst of the heat.

08:45.639 --> 08:49.800
I'd say he was cremated, at most,
a few hours after he died.

08:49.839 --> 08:52.959
And is DNA out of the question?
We still don't know who he is.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.039
Give us a chance.
I'm getting to the good bit.

08:55.079 --> 08:58.119
Burnt bodies adopt what's
known as a pugilistic attitude.

08:58.159 --> 08:59.879
So their arms go into
a boxing stance.

08:59.920 --> 09:03.039
Now, if you look at his hands,
they're balled into fists.

09:06.239 --> 09:08.879
So his fingertips were protected.

09:09.519 --> 09:11.519
We're running a trace for the match.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.839
Marcus, I think you just made my day.

09:16.519 --> 09:17.920
Now tell me you didn't miss me.

09:17.959 --> 09:21.239
Well, don't let it go to your head.
It's big enough as it is.

09:24.439 --> 09:26.920
Shot by a bullet
to the back of the head.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.439
A few hours at most
before he was found.

09:30.479 --> 09:33.000
Must have made some noise.
Someone would have heard it.

09:33.039 --> 09:35.319
Not necessarily,
the din in that place.

09:35.360 --> 09:39.159
Now the question is,
was he shot at the abattoir,

09:39.200 --> 09:41.119
and his body hidden on site?

09:41.159 --> 09:43.800
Or was he killed elsewhere -
Ma'am.

09:43.839 --> 09:47.119
- and then brought in. What?
Forensics ran the victim's prints.

09:47.159 --> 09:48.920
Now we're talking!

09:48.959 --> 09:50.959
He must have got a record.
Yeah.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.720
Police Elimination Database.

10:01.920 --> 10:03.720
Our dead man was a copper.

10:14.159 --> 10:18.800
So could we just rewind
to yesterday morning?

10:18.839 --> 10:22.839
Erm... Your husband left for work
as usual, did he?

10:22.879 --> 10:25.800
Must have been about 8:30.

10:28.079 --> 10:30.079
It's a 20-minute drive.

10:30.119 --> 10:32.639
And you were expecting him home
at what time?

10:33.680 --> 10:35.680
He promised me he wouldn't be late.

10:37.959 --> 10:39.639
For once in his life.

10:41.720 --> 10:44.000
We had his send-off to get to.
Send-off?

10:45.079 --> 10:47.079
Retirement bash over at the club.

10:48.079 --> 10:49.560
Sawton Social and Welfare.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.800
Your husband was due to retire,
was he?

10:52.600 --> 10:54.600
It was his last day at work.

10:55.639 --> 10:57.639
38 years he'd been a copper.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.600
This was meant to be our time.
(DOOR OPENS)

11:03.720 --> 11:06.239
And you've no idea
where he might have got to?

11:07.720 --> 11:10.119
I... I tried calling Hayley,
my daughter.

11:11.119 --> 11:12.920
Her phone was switched off.

11:12.959 --> 11:15.519
I was working. Double shift.

11:17.159 --> 11:18.879
Drink this.
I'm all right.

11:18.920 --> 11:20.920
It'll make you feel better, Mam.

11:20.959 --> 11:22.959
Why would anyone want to kill him?

11:23.000 --> 11:25.720
Well, that's what we're
trying to find out, pet.

11:25.759 --> 11:27.759
So was there anything?

11:29.039 --> 11:32.519
Any recent behaviour of your husband,
or your dad,

11:32.560 --> 11:35.039
that might've given you
cause for concern?

11:35.879 --> 11:38.239
He...he was tired, that's all.

11:39.319 --> 11:41.439
Tired of the grind.

11:41.479 --> 11:43.479
Well, what about work?

11:43.519 --> 11:45.519
Anything giving him any problems?

11:45.560 --> 11:50.879
Harry never talked about his cases.
He...didn't bring it home with him.

11:50.920 --> 11:54.280
Well, any fall-outs at all?
Friends, family?

11:54.319 --> 11:55.680
Surely this can wait?

11:55.720 --> 11:59.959
I'm just trying to get a fix
on your dad's state of mind, love.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
She's still in shock.

12:02.039 --> 12:04.039
Look at her. She's barely slept.

12:08.039 --> 12:10.680
Well, we'll contact
a Police Liaison Officer

12:10.720 --> 12:13.439
and they will talk you through
what happens next.

12:13.479 --> 12:15.360
I'll stay here with her.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.400
Make sure she's OK.

12:29.039 --> 12:32.879
Copper goes missing. Why wasn't it
flagged up to neighbouring stations?

12:32.920 --> 12:35.519
Well, I'll find out what time
she called it in.

12:38.159 --> 12:42.519
Killed on the day he's due to retire,
after 38 years on the job.

12:44.239 --> 12:46.239
Never turns up for his send-off.

12:47.239 --> 12:48.759
Can't say I blame him.

12:48.800 --> 12:51.200
Hm! Well, that might not be much
to look at.

12:52.039 --> 12:54.360
But here's where we'll
get the measure of the man.

13:08.720 --> 13:12.280
DCI Vera Stanhope,
Northumberland and City Police.

13:12.319 --> 13:14.319
Is this about Harry?

13:14.360 --> 13:17.560
He was due here last night.
Retirement bash.

13:17.600 --> 13:19.680
Yeah, just wanted to give him
a good send-off.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.439
Mm. Regular was he?

13:22.479 --> 13:25.639
Oh, him and Rita.
Every Friday, Rain or shine.

13:25.680 --> 13:28.119
So were you concerned
when they never turned up?

13:28.159 --> 13:30.839
Well, Rita called.
Told us he hadn't come home.

13:30.879 --> 13:33.759
Jesse would've gone over,
if we hadn't been so pushed.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.800
Jesse?
Other half.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.439
Pair of them went way back.

13:40.200 --> 13:43.119
Right, so could you give
DS Healy a statement, love?

13:47.239 --> 13:49.239
Have you got a minute?

13:49.680 --> 13:51.800
Just a few questions
I need to ask you.

13:58.800 --> 14:01.360
Good mates, then, you and Harry? Hm?

14:01.400 --> 14:02.479
Well...

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
I knew him better than anybody.

14:09.639 --> 14:11.639
What, catch up in here, did you?

14:11.680 --> 14:13.759
Friday nights?

14:13.800 --> 14:15.800
We both joined this club.

14:16.039 --> 14:17.479
18.

14:17.519 --> 14:19.519
Cards handed over by our dads.

14:20.920 --> 14:22.920
I did the same with my own lad.

14:26.360 --> 14:29.159
Friendship even
survived him becoming a copper.

14:29.920 --> 14:32.319
(LADS CHEERING)
Oh, give it a rest, lads!

14:32.360 --> 14:34.280
A bit of respect!
Sorry, mate.

14:34.319 --> 14:36.319
Ah, they're just lads.

14:38.239 --> 14:40.439
When did you speak to him last?

14:40.479 --> 14:43.200
We spoke on the phone.
Must have been yesterday lunchtime.

14:43.239 --> 14:46.239
Wanted to give him a heads-up -
this leaving do they were planning.

14:46.280 --> 14:48.560
And how did he seem on the phone?

14:48.600 --> 14:51.360
Preoccupied.
Not quite himself, you know?

14:51.400 --> 14:52.759
What do you mean by that?

14:52.800 --> 14:55.600
Well, I put it down
to this impending retirement.

14:56.159 --> 14:59.079
He'd never have told Rita
but Harry was dreading it.

14:59.119 --> 15:01.439
All that time on his hands? Nah!

15:22.439 --> 15:23.959
DI Chandra?
Yeah.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
DS Healey.
Hi. Good to meet you.

15:26.039 --> 15:29.319
DCI Stanhope. Hello. Good
to meet you. Please take a seat.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.560
I'm not sure
it's really sunk in yet.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.360
Ah, well,
when it's one of your own.

15:38.639 --> 15:39.959
Any leads you can work with?

15:40.000 --> 15:43.239
No, we're still trying to build
a picture of his final movements.

15:43.280 --> 15:45.560
We know he left for work as usual,
day he died.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.039
Well, that doesn't stack up.

15:47.920 --> 15:48.959
Why do you say that?

15:49.000 --> 15:51.879
He rang in sick.
Think he spoke to DC Williams.

15:51.920 --> 15:54.759
So nobody saw him at all, yesterday?

15:54.800 --> 15:56.959
He hadn't been himself all week.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.400
Any recent cases
might ring alarm bells?

16:00.439 --> 16:02.360
You think it might have been
work-related?

16:02.400 --> 16:04.680
Well, I can't rule it out,
the manner of his death.

16:04.720 --> 16:07.239
If Harry had concerns,
he would have brought them to me.

16:07.280 --> 16:10.759
You said he wasn't himself.
He seemed out of sorts, that's all.

16:10.800 --> 16:14.600
Hm. Well, I'll need to talk
to DC Williams.

16:15.759 --> 16:18.000
There should be a briefing.
Some kind of pep talk.

16:18.039 --> 16:20.039
Plenty of time for that.

16:22.560 --> 16:24.560
Is this his desk?

16:29.800 --> 16:32.720
We'd all had a whip-round.
DC Jacqueline Williams.

16:33.560 --> 16:34.800
Friends call us Jac, ma'am.

16:34.839 --> 16:37.759
You spoke to him on the phone
yesterday. Said he wasn't coming in.

16:37.800 --> 16:40.600
He said if anyone asked,
he was under the weather.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.200
What sort of a copper was he?

16:47.439 --> 16:48.680
Safe pair of hands.

16:48.720 --> 16:52.400
Solid, reliable. Though sometimes
he skimped on the paperwork.

16:53.200 --> 16:54.920
Harry was one of the old school.

16:56.360 --> 16:58.879
Now, Brenkley Abattoir,
where we found him.

16:59.479 --> 17:01.479
They were fined a few years back.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.319
We referred the case to the CPS.

17:04.360 --> 17:06.079
DC Fenton get involved?

17:06.119 --> 17:09.680
Not directly. The leg work
was done by Local Trading Standards.

17:10.560 --> 17:15.800
Right. DS Healey, I'm going to need
all his recent case loads, laptop...

17:15.839 --> 17:18.959
I'll make sure you get everything.
DC Williams can you give a hand?

17:19.000 --> 17:20.920
We all want to nail
whoever did this.

17:20.959 --> 17:23.759
We'll keep you up to speed,
any developments.

17:24.280 --> 17:25.519
Thanks.

17:27.119 --> 17:29.119
So...pulls a sickie.

17:29.800 --> 17:32.119
Lies to his wife,
lies to his colleagues.

17:33.039 --> 17:36.560
That's somewhat at odds
with all those glowing testimonials.

17:37.800 --> 17:42.319
And the SIO says he's out of sorts.

17:43.920 --> 17:46.200
What do we make of DI Chandra?

17:46.239 --> 17:48.239
A rising star, by all accounts.

17:49.479 --> 17:51.479
Ambitious young copper.

17:52.119 --> 17:54.280
What was it she called him,
old school?

17:54.319 --> 17:57.800
Ah, well, that could make
for a dysfunctional relationship.

17:57.839 --> 17:59.920
I wouldn't know anything about that.

18:00.839 --> 18:02.439
Meaning?

18:04.039 --> 18:07.439
Harry Fenton's recent caseload,
wrested from Fraud.

18:07.479 --> 18:09.800
Now, I want you to look at
every single case.

18:09.839 --> 18:15.159
Potential ties to organised crime,
identity theft, online hacking.

18:15.200 --> 18:17.280
People you wouldn't wanna mess with.

18:17.319 --> 18:19.319
You saying this
might be gang related?

18:19.360 --> 18:21.360
Well, we can't rule it out, Kenny.

18:21.400 --> 18:25.000
Now, we know he left home
round about 8:30,

18:25.039 --> 18:27.319
morning of the day he was murdered.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.079
Now, if he's not at work,

18:29.200 --> 18:33.039
we need to trace his whereabouts
in those missing hours.

18:33.079 --> 18:35.079
We've got Harry Fenton's
phone log here.

18:35.119 --> 18:37.600
Now, that was a police issue mobile,
wasn't it?

18:37.639 --> 18:39.479
One contact flags up.

18:39.519 --> 18:42.239
Five calls from a Pay As You Go
in the past two days.

18:42.280 --> 18:45.479
One on Friday afternoon.
Call lasted less than a minute.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.879
So the day he died,
who's he talking to?

18:48.920 --> 18:51.600
Yeah, we're still getting a fix
on the GPS data.

18:53.680 --> 18:56.159
So any other theories
while we're waiting?

18:56.200 --> 18:59.079
I ran a check on Harry's finances,
ma'am. Hm?

18:59.119 --> 19:02.439
Well, he's fully signed up
into the police pension scheme.

19:03.079 --> 19:05.600
But if Harry was killed
in the line of duty...

19:05.639 --> 19:08.079
Well, we're a long way
from proving that, Kenny.

19:08.119 --> 19:10.920
Well, his wife would be due
a substantial pay-out .

19:10.959 --> 19:14.159
It may not be anything, ma'am...
Well, go on, spit it out.

19:14.200 --> 19:17.479
Well, I did some follow-up
into those horsemeat sales.

19:17.519 --> 19:19.400
The foreman that was fined
at Brenkley.

19:19.439 --> 19:20.479
Yeah, Hobswain?

19:20.519 --> 19:24.039
Yeah, reportedly
threatened the abattoir inspectors.

19:24.959 --> 19:27.239
Uniform were called in as backup.
Hm!

19:27.280 --> 19:30.079
He's also the go-to
Northumberland knacker man.

19:30.839 --> 19:33.079
So a man who handles guns
for a living.

19:33.119 --> 19:35.000
Doesn't make him a murderer.
No.

19:35.039 --> 19:37.159
But it makes him
a person of interest.

19:54.639 --> 19:56.159
Mr Hobswain.

19:56.200 --> 19:58.439
What is it this time?

19:58.479 --> 20:02.079
That fella you found in your furnace,
we've got an ID.

20:03.759 --> 20:05.759
Copper.
Never seen him before.

20:07.280 --> 20:09.000
Where were you, Friday afternoon?

20:09.039 --> 20:11.119
Hexham races.

20:11.159 --> 20:13.280
Eyeing up some more horseflesh?

20:14.200 --> 20:17.159
See, we know
you were done for malpractice.

20:17.200 --> 20:18.639
Horsemeat ready meals.

20:18.680 --> 20:21.200
I paid the fine. Took on board
their recommendations.

20:21.239 --> 20:24.360
Ah, now, here's the thing.
I'm not sure you did.

20:24.400 --> 20:27.000
Maybe that's how this body
got in undetected.

20:28.159 --> 20:29.759
Look, sometimes we cut corners.

20:29.800 --> 20:32.360
We need to, to survive
in this business.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.560
I've just had a chat
with the CSI team.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.479
They tell me
you've been uncooperative.

20:36.519 --> 20:38.519
Oh, bit of a pattern forming here.

20:38.560 --> 20:40.400
Threaten them too, did you?

20:40.439 --> 20:42.360
Look, this place is on its arse
as it is.

20:42.400 --> 20:45.159
Once word gets out they've
found a body, it'll finish us.

20:45.200 --> 20:49.119
We'll need to see your gun permits.
Any firearms you're licensed to hold.

20:49.159 --> 20:50.319
Going to tell us why?

20:50.360 --> 20:53.039
Well, this copper had been shot
through the back of the head.

20:54.319 --> 20:55.479
And youse think I done it?

20:55.519 --> 20:59.000
Well, I'm sure you won't mind us
ruling you out. (PHONE RINGS)

20:59.039 --> 21:00.319
Yes, Kenny?

21:00.360 --> 21:03.079
You might want to get over
to Low Palton, ma'am.

21:03.119 --> 21:06.360
We've found Harry's car.
Is it definitely his?

21:06.400 --> 21:08.479
Definitely. Registration matches.

21:08.519 --> 21:12.879
Low Palton?
What's he doing parked up there?

21:45.639 --> 21:49.159
All this clutter on the front seat
rules out any passenger.

21:49.200 --> 21:50.839
Drove here alone.

21:50.879 --> 21:53.200
Marcus found
a second set of tyre tracks.

21:53.839 --> 21:55.839
So meeting someone?

22:02.519 --> 22:04.519
Shoes here.

22:10.360 --> 22:12.360
Petrol receipt.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.400
Sawton Burn Services.

22:15.439 --> 22:18.079
Friday's date, 16:03.

22:18.119 --> 22:20.839
Well, get over to the garage.
CCTV.

22:20.879 --> 22:24.800
Ma'am, we've just checked the SIM
card intel on Harry's missing phone.

22:24.839 --> 22:26.959
Mast gives a reading
top of that hill.

23:02.200 --> 23:03.200
Ma'am?

23:14.600 --> 23:16.319
You should take a look at this,
ma'am.

23:16.360 --> 23:18.560
I think we might have
found something.

23:24.800 --> 23:27.879
It looks like someone
has tried to clean this place up.

23:32.680 --> 23:34.680
Is that blood?

23:36.879 --> 23:38.879
Ma'am.

23:39.800 --> 23:41.439
It's definitely blood.

23:42.079 --> 23:44.800
Right, get forensics up here.

23:46.039 --> 23:48.560
I think we've just found
our murder scene.

23:59.560 --> 24:00.759
What have you got?

24:00.800 --> 24:02.800
We've got some partial shoe treads.

24:02.839 --> 24:04.479
It's a heavy walking boot. Size 10s.

24:04.519 --> 24:06.959
It's a public footpath.
That could belong to anyone.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.479
I know. There's a distinctive
gouge mark worn into the tread.

24:11.600 --> 24:13.600
Oh, right.

24:14.600 --> 24:16.680
Have you got anything else
for us to work with?

24:16.720 --> 24:18.720
Yeah. Over here.

24:25.720 --> 24:27.720
See this drag mark?

24:27.759 --> 24:30.119
I'd say the body
was brought through here.

24:30.159 --> 24:32.959
Because the ground was wet,
it's left a decent imprint.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.119
You're saying he was dragged
from those outbuildings,

24:36.159 --> 24:38.360
all the way down to the lane?

24:38.400 --> 24:39.879
Just about sums it up.

24:39.920 --> 24:41.800
Well, that would have
taken some doing.

24:43.920 --> 24:48.639
Right, get that blood checked.
With any luck, we'll have a match.

24:49.479 --> 24:51.079
I'll keep you posted, ma'am.

24:54.439 --> 24:56.920
Rained Friday,
late afternoon, didn't it?

24:56.959 --> 24:59.439
That barn's the nearest place
you can take shelter.

24:59.479 --> 25:01.800
Well, they could have just sat
in the car.

25:04.280 --> 25:06.280
This must've been planned.

25:07.319 --> 25:09.319
Premeditated.

25:09.879 --> 25:12.600
Whoever killed him
led him off the beaten track.

25:13.959 --> 25:15.959
Away from any witnesses.

25:18.159 --> 25:19.839
Where's this lane lead to?

25:22.600 --> 25:26.079
Couple of villages.
Bolam and Hartbridge.

25:26.119 --> 25:28.319
Farming country
both sides of the river.

25:28.360 --> 25:31.360
That direction - That leads
to the B road we came in on.

25:34.119 --> 25:37.680
So Harry comes up here
to meet his killer.

25:38.360 --> 25:40.360
Hm.

25:40.800 --> 25:45.039
How does he end up in that abattoir
20 miles away?

25:50.800 --> 25:53.239
Ma'am, Iain Hobswain's alibi
checked out.

25:53.280 --> 25:54.400
What?

25:54.439 --> 25:58.639
The head groundsman at Hexham Races
can confirm he worked at the meet.

25:58.680 --> 26:00.680
The last race was at 4:45.

26:01.319 --> 26:03.600
So that gives him a couple of hours,
tops.

26:05.159 --> 26:07.280
Well, it's tight,
but it's still possible.

26:07.319 --> 26:09.920
No, ballistics have ran a check
on Hobswain's pistol.

26:09.959 --> 26:11.920
They've ruled it out
as the murder weapon.

26:11.959 --> 26:14.759
His only other firearm
was a bolt gun.

26:15.959 --> 26:18.239
So what sort of weapon
are we looking for?

26:18.280 --> 26:20.839
An Italian Beretta M, 1935.

26:20.879 --> 26:23.680
It's World War II standard issue.
Oh, great (!)

26:23.720 --> 26:27.200
Means any Tom, Dick or Harry could
have one gathering dust in the attic.

26:27.239 --> 26:29.119
Well, I think we can rule out Harry,
ma'am.

26:29.159 --> 26:31.479
Unless he shot himself.
Very funny.

26:31.519 --> 26:33.720
They checked the footage
at the petrol station.

26:33.759 --> 26:36.159
Confirms Harry was alone in the car.
Right.

26:36.600 --> 26:38.600
So what HAVE we got?

26:40.119 --> 26:42.119
He's alive and well at 4:00.

26:43.759 --> 26:46.639
It rains around 5:00
up at Low Palton.

26:46.680 --> 26:49.800
And Brenkley is, what, 20 miles away.

26:49.839 --> 26:53.119
So that body had to have
been taken into that abattoir

26:53.159 --> 26:55.879
about an hour later. Six-ish.

26:55.920 --> 26:58.400
Which narrows down
our list of suppliers, ma'am.

26:58.439 --> 26:59.560
Right.

26:59.600 --> 27:05.200
Only two vehicles are recorded
on camera after 6pm last Friday.

27:05.239 --> 27:08.680
One was
picking up butchered meat...

27:09.280 --> 27:11.800
What's the other one?
It's a delivery lorry.

27:12.759 --> 27:14.759
At 18:13.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.400
Pause it, Kenny.

27:18.600 --> 27:20.600
Acreman's Haulage.

27:21.439 --> 27:23.439
The yard's over in Morpeth, ma'am.

27:34.239 --> 27:36.119
WOMAN: Well, you know what
they're like.

27:36.159 --> 27:38.280
I've got to get this stuff out
on time.

27:38.319 --> 27:40.560
I'm not taking the flack for youse,
all right?

27:40.600 --> 27:41.639
Hiya.

27:41.680 --> 27:43.680
I'm looking for the foreman.

27:43.720 --> 27:47.280
You've just found her. I'm DS Healy
from Northumberland and City Police.

27:47.319 --> 27:49.079
This is DCI Stanhope.

27:49.119 --> 27:51.360
Is there somewhere quiet
we can talk, love?

27:51.400 --> 27:54.560
We can go in the office.
Yeah, grand.

27:58.680 --> 28:00.680
Aye, we deliver to Brenkley.

28:00.720 --> 28:04.759
We've had a contract with
the abattoir for...for years now.

28:04.800 --> 28:07.959
Hm! Well, one of your trucks
was there on Friday afternoon.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
We'd like a word with the driver.

28:11.439 --> 28:15.319
Friday. Right, well,
that would have been...

28:18.000 --> 28:19.680
Naz.

28:19.720 --> 28:21.720
Naz?
He's due out on a job.

28:22.479 --> 28:25.439
Well, could you catch him,
love, please?

28:29.280 --> 28:32.280
Give Naz a poke, would you?
I need a word in the office.

28:34.680 --> 28:36.439
You gonna tell us
what this is about?

28:36.479 --> 28:40.239
Ah, well, we're here
in connection with a murder, pet.

28:40.280 --> 28:41.920
Police detective.

28:41.959 --> 28:44.680
The body was discovered
in the abattoir incinerator.

28:44.720 --> 28:46.560
What's that got to do with us?

28:46.600 --> 28:49.479
Well, we think it was delivered there
in that truck.

28:50.959 --> 28:52.959
No way.

28:53.720 --> 28:56.119
The loads are always checked
by the drivers.

28:57.200 --> 28:59.319
You wanted to see me?
Police are here.

29:00.879 --> 29:02.079
Now what?

29:02.119 --> 29:04.239
If you could just step in
for a second.

29:07.560 --> 29:11.159
We're trying to trace the last
known whereabouts of this fella.

29:12.239 --> 29:14.759
Recognise him?
Should I?

29:14.800 --> 29:17.439
Detective Constable Harry Fenton.

29:17.479 --> 29:18.920
Deceased.

29:19.680 --> 29:22.079
Body was found
over at Brenkley Abattoir.

29:22.400 --> 29:25.079
You delivered to Brenkley,
day he died.

29:25.119 --> 29:27.039
Friday afternoon.

29:27.079 --> 29:28.959
Aye. So what?

29:29.000 --> 29:31.479
Well, I'd like an account
of your movements.

29:31.519 --> 29:33.680
I collected some crates
from Bowmead Foods.

29:33.720 --> 29:36.119
Catering unit
over at Haydon Bridge.

29:36.159 --> 29:37.600
It's all in the logs.

29:37.639 --> 29:39.000
And what time was that?

29:39.039 --> 29:41.639
Must have been about 4:30,
end of their shift.

29:42.600 --> 29:45.720
Right. And this waste you pick up,

29:45.759 --> 29:48.159
that's all set
for the incinerator, is it?

29:48.200 --> 29:49.639
Aye. That's right.

29:49.680 --> 29:53.200
Right, we're going to need
a forensics team

29:53.239 --> 29:54.519
to examine the vehicle.

29:54.560 --> 29:57.280
Hang on. What for?

29:57.319 --> 30:00.239
They're suggesting this body
was delivered in the lorry.

30:00.280 --> 30:02.600
And you thought
you'd point the finger at me?

30:03.879 --> 30:06.600
I never said that, love.
Just making enquiries, that's all.

30:06.639 --> 30:08.800
Do you think
I would have missed a body?

30:08.839 --> 30:11.519
Well, it didn't walk there,
I know that much.

30:13.159 --> 30:15.479
You're welcome to check
any vehicles you want to.

30:15.519 --> 30:18.439
But they'll have all been
cleaned and disinfected.

30:19.839 --> 30:21.039
Health and Safety.

30:25.759 --> 30:27.879
I'm late for a job
so if there's nothing else?

30:27.920 --> 30:31.000
No, we know where we can find you.

30:34.720 --> 30:36.680
He's a decent driver.

30:36.720 --> 30:39.479
Bit of a chip, that's all.

30:47.759 --> 30:49.759
Get Kenny over to Bowmead Foods.

30:50.400 --> 30:53.400
Do a check on his movements.
The factory set-up.

30:53.439 --> 30:55.959
And do a background check
on the pair of them.

31:02.759 --> 31:04.759
Just give me a minute.

31:08.360 --> 31:10.360
Jesse Hennings' lad, isn't it?

31:13.159 --> 31:15.560
Gareth.
Oh, I didn't know you worked here.

31:17.159 --> 31:19.159
Must be a nearly a year now.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.119
What, you're one of the drivers?

31:21.159 --> 31:22.920
Only the forklift.

31:22.959 --> 31:24.959
Warehouse stuff, mainly.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.959
'Ey, I bet you don't miss much.
All the comings and goings.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.720
I keep a log of every consignment.

31:31.759 --> 31:33.759
Pick-ups, deliveries.

31:36.959 --> 31:38.479
Are you here about Harry?

31:40.639 --> 31:42.079
Why do you say that?

31:43.759 --> 31:45.759
I just wondered, that's all.
Hm.

31:46.879 --> 31:49.280
I know he'd been here
asking questions.

31:49.319 --> 31:51.319
Has he?

31:52.360 --> 31:53.519
When was that?

31:53.560 --> 31:57.200
Few weeks ago.
Something to do with an audit.

31:59.159 --> 32:01.159
Did he tell you that down the club?

32:01.720 --> 32:03.720
Said he couldn't talk about it.

32:09.519 --> 32:11.519
I should get back to work.

32:14.159 --> 32:16.319
Aye, don't let me stop you.

32:27.959 --> 32:30.280
Acreman's Haulage.
What can you tell us?

32:31.200 --> 32:34.079
The yard's currently under
investigation. I'm the SIO.

32:34.119 --> 32:36.600
What? Suspected fraud?

32:37.200 --> 32:38.959
Anonymous source rang Crimestoppers.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.639
Claimed some of the drivers
were laundering dirty money.

32:41.680 --> 32:43.360
Did this source give you names?

32:43.400 --> 32:45.319
No.
But you followed it up?

32:45.360 --> 32:48.039
Harry went to the yard
with some initial enquiries.

32:48.079 --> 32:50.319
Did that throw up
anything we should know about?

32:50.360 --> 32:52.360
Nothing incriminating.

32:52.400 --> 32:54.400
The case is ongoing.

32:55.800 --> 32:57.239
As we're all sharing,

32:57.280 --> 32:59.200
why the sudden interest
in Acreman's?

32:59.239 --> 33:01.800
Oh, it might not be relevant
at this stage, love.

33:01.839 --> 33:04.239
If you've got a lead
I should know about...

33:05.479 --> 33:08.000
Harry was family. This is personal.

33:08.039 --> 33:12.000
Yeah, which is why I think it's
best if you took a step back.

33:12.039 --> 33:13.439
OK.

33:13.479 --> 33:15.079
This might not be relevant either

33:15.119 --> 33:19.000
but Harry asked to be taken off the
case. Cited a conflict of interest.

33:19.039 --> 33:20.680
Didn't tell you what that was?

33:20.720 --> 33:22.560
I didn't ask.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.800
He was all set to retire.
Exemplary record.

33:24.839 --> 33:26.560
I wasn't going to compromise that.

33:26.600 --> 33:28.879
Well, I'm glad
we've got that straight.

33:29.560 --> 33:32.479
It's a pity you didn't
think to mention that before.

33:46.360 --> 33:49.159
So our victim's investigating
a possible fraud.

33:50.759 --> 33:52.759
Best mate's son works at that yard.

33:54.079 --> 33:56.079
Plenty of people in Sawton do.

33:56.159 --> 33:59.720
Aye, that might explain
his conflict of interest.

34:02.159 --> 34:04.159
Harry wants out.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.119
DI Chandra would have kept
that little nugget to herself.

34:08.159 --> 34:09.639
What if Gareth tipped off Harry?

34:09.680 --> 34:13.079
Either that,
or Gareth was in on this scam.

34:13.119 --> 34:16.079
And Harry found out?
It's a possibility.

34:16.119 --> 34:18.360
Let's see if his wife
can tell us anything.

34:22.759 --> 34:24.759
Your daughter not here?

34:25.400 --> 34:28.360
Had to go into work.
Uh, Mrs Fenton...

34:30.079 --> 34:32.079
We found your husband's car.

34:33.519 --> 34:35.759
It was parked in woodland,
edge of the moor,

34:35.800 --> 34:37.800
a few miles outside Morpeth.

34:38.959 --> 34:41.280
Any idea what he was doing there?

34:43.280 --> 34:46.360
He'd... He'd take himself off
whenever it suited him.

34:46.400 --> 34:50.800
Erm... Used to walk for...for miles.

34:50.839 --> 34:53.119
We think he'd arranged
to meet someone.

34:53.159 --> 34:54.839
I can't think who.

34:54.879 --> 34:58.200
Well, they're going to be releasing
your husband's body in a few days.

34:58.239 --> 35:00.319
So you'll need to make arrangements.

35:02.479 --> 35:04.479
He'll need something to wear.

35:05.800 --> 35:08.200
Best jacket's laid out on the bed.

35:09.079 --> 35:11.039
I'll go and fetch it.

35:14.680 --> 35:17.879
Well, he must have been well-liked,
all these tributes.

35:19.839 --> 35:22.400
Eileen came round, from the club.

35:22.439 --> 35:24.439
Sat for a while.

35:24.479 --> 35:28.239
Mm. Now, her son, Gareth,
works over at Acreman's yard?

35:28.280 --> 35:30.360
Jesse got him a job there.

35:30.400 --> 35:33.079
Did you know the yard
was under investigation?

35:33.119 --> 35:34.959
No. No, I didn't.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.800
Oh. Harry never mentioned it?
No.

35:40.959 --> 35:42.959
Sent flowers, Acreman's.

35:44.159 --> 35:46.159
Courier dropped 'em off yesterday.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.479
Handwritten card.

35:55.439 --> 35:58.039
Dale Acreman, company director.

35:59.639 --> 36:01.639
So did Harry know him personally?

36:01.680 --> 36:03.560
He grew up in Sawton.

36:03.600 --> 36:05.439
Ah, and they kept in touch.

36:05.479 --> 36:08.479
Oh! Dale Acreman didn't
have time for the likes of us.

36:10.159 --> 36:13.479
He hasn't set foot here
in 20-odd years.

36:17.479 --> 36:19.680
Pockets are clean.
Shoes are a size 12.

36:19.720 --> 36:22.319
Same as those shoes in his car.

36:22.360 --> 36:24.560
There's nothing else
we can work with.

36:27.519 --> 36:29.079
Give us ten minutes.

36:30.319 --> 36:32.319
And we'll head back to the station.

36:43.720 --> 36:45.079
You'd best be careful.

36:45.119 --> 36:47.920
This beach has pockets
of quicksand.

36:47.959 --> 36:51.039
Aye, all the way over
to the holiday park.

36:51.079 --> 36:54.680
I know these sands well enough, love.
I'll watch my step.

36:54.720 --> 36:56.600
Is it razors?

36:56.639 --> 36:58.720
Aye. Plenty out here
if you know where to look.

36:58.759 --> 37:00.759
Aye, just follow the dimples.
Aye.

37:00.800 --> 37:02.800
(CHUCKLES)

37:05.720 --> 37:07.720
Something you wanted?

37:08.639 --> 37:10.639
Acreman's Haulage Yard.

37:11.920 --> 37:14.519
You must have known
there was a fraud enquiry.

37:14.560 --> 37:16.560
Must I?

37:16.839 --> 37:18.839
Well, your Gareth works there.

37:21.439 --> 37:23.200
Harry warned us
to keep an eye on him.

37:23.239 --> 37:25.639
Said some of the drivers
were stealing money.

37:25.680 --> 37:28.039
So it wasn't Gareth
tipped off the police?

37:28.079 --> 37:29.119
No, it wasn't.

37:29.159 --> 37:31.800
Did you put in a word
in with Dale Acreman?

37:33.600 --> 37:36.800
I know he grew up in Sawton,
back before he made his money.

37:38.720 --> 37:41.759
Spoke to his secretary.
Asked if he might help us out.

37:41.800 --> 37:43.800
Offers him a job?

37:44.400 --> 37:46.839
Dale's never forgotten
where he came from.

37:46.879 --> 37:48.879
Even donated some money to the club.

37:49.839 --> 37:51.560
What did Harry say to that?

37:51.600 --> 37:54.400
I'm not sure
he ever ventured an opinion.

37:54.439 --> 37:57.560
Well he must have said something,
with the drivers on the take.

37:57.600 --> 37:59.600
Idle talk. Probably meant nothing.

38:04.319 --> 38:06.319
Tide's on the turn.

38:06.360 --> 38:08.959
Aye. Best go back.

38:14.560 --> 38:17.479
You said Harry
hadn't been feeling himself lately.

38:17.519 --> 38:19.519
He was feeling his age, that's all.

38:20.519 --> 38:23.200
Well, I think it was more
than this retirement.

38:23.879 --> 38:26.600
I think he wanted to get
something off his chest.

38:27.959 --> 38:30.280
He'd given his life to the job.

38:30.319 --> 38:32.639
All those years of hard graft
taken for granted.

38:32.680 --> 38:34.360
Put out to grass.

38:34.400 --> 38:37.119
That can make a man bitter.
Even the best of them.

38:45.319 --> 38:46.839
I'll do it.

38:46.879 --> 38:48.879
I'll do that. Cheers, thanks.

38:48.920 --> 38:51.119
Ma'am, I've just spoken
to forensics.

38:51.920 --> 38:54.239
They found a blood trace
on the boot tread.

38:54.280 --> 38:56.600
Blood's confirmed
as matching Harry's.

38:56.639 --> 38:59.959
And have we ruled these boots out
as being his?

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Wrong size feet, ma'am.

39:02.039 --> 39:04.839
So they must have been worn
by whoever killed him.

39:04.879 --> 39:06.879
Yeah.

39:09.360 --> 39:14.159
I think we've been sidelined by
this possible link to the abattoir.

39:14.200 --> 39:17.800
We should be concentrating
on this fraud enquiry.

39:18.239 --> 39:22.239
Acreman's Haulage.
Drivers laundering dirty money.

39:22.280 --> 39:25.119
There's no record of Gareth Hennings
being questioned, ma'am.

39:25.159 --> 39:27.759
But Harry did take a statement
from Naz Ahmed.

39:28.959 --> 39:31.680
So Ahmed lied when he said
he didn't recognise him.

39:31.720 --> 39:34.360
There's a good reason
why he hasn't been straight with us.

39:34.400 --> 39:38.039
Naz Ahmed's got previous
for violent affray.

39:38.079 --> 39:39.879
A six-month stretch in Durham.

39:39.920 --> 39:42.600
Well, that'll explain
the crust on him.

39:42.639 --> 39:46.280
Listen, I spoke to the suppliers,
erm...Bowmead Food.

39:46.319 --> 39:48.600
The statement he gave checks out.

39:48.639 --> 39:50.479
He left the factory at 4:37.

39:50.519 --> 39:53.519
It was recorded and verified
by the factory foreman.

39:53.560 --> 39:55.560
Yeah, but the...

39:56.200 --> 39:58.879
He didn't get to that abattoir
till after 6:00.

39:59.600 --> 40:02.239
So what was keeping him?
Well, there was a bit of a detour.

40:02.280 --> 40:05.680
According to the job sheets
we got from the haulage company,

40:06.079 --> 40:09.039
he stopped off to pick up
some fallen livestock.

40:09.079 --> 40:11.319
Yeah, where?
Where's the pick-up point?

40:11.360 --> 40:13.519
Near the village of Hartbridge,
ma'am.

40:13.560 --> 40:15.000
Hartbridge?

40:16.039 --> 40:18.879
That's less than
a mile from our murder scene.

with caution.

Out of the vehicle now!

40:36.280 --> 40:38.159
Out of the vehicle now!

40:38.200 --> 40:39.200
Move!

(HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRR)

41:18.639 --> 41:20.600
We're at the haulage yard now,
ma'am.

41:20.639 --> 41:22.639
No sign of the boss.

41:22.680 --> 41:25.639
She went home lunchtime.
Looks like she's cleared the office.

41:25.680 --> 41:27.639
Well, she won't
get in your way, then.

41:27.680 --> 41:30.759
Now, you'll need a warrant
to confiscate what's left.

41:30.839 --> 41:32.519
Computers, CCTV.

41:32.560 --> 41:34.800
And get her home address.

41:34.839 --> 41:37.600
You've arrested Naz Ahmed?
Aye. Just about to question him.

41:37.639 --> 41:39.519
When were you planning
on telling me?

41:39.560 --> 41:42.200
Well, you're here now, aren't you?

41:42.239 --> 41:44.439
This could compromise
my fraud investigation.

41:44.479 --> 41:47.319
I'm afraid that can't be helped,
love. I want to sit in on this.

41:47.360 --> 41:49.759
Well, you can watch
from the viewing room.

41:52.319 --> 41:54.360
And just remember
who you're talking to.

41:58.239 --> 41:59.239
Ma'am.

42:01.519 --> 42:05.239

Took us a while to count it.

42:06.920 --> 42:08.920
Now, we know this is dirty money.

42:09.439 --> 42:11.759
I pick it up and I drop it
where I'm told to.

42:11.800 --> 42:13.800
Nah, I think it's more than that.

42:13.839 --> 42:16.879
I think you're running this scam
with your forewoman.

42:16.920 --> 42:18.000
I barely know her.

42:18.039 --> 42:21.079
Well, she's disappeared
with the rest of the dosh.

42:21.119 --> 42:23.119
Know where she's gone?

42:23.159 --> 42:24.600
Hm?

42:24.639 --> 42:28.000
Well, we've checked the books.
There's plenty of money missing.

42:29.920 --> 42:32.280
Now, then, you collected
some fallen livestock...

42:35.400 --> 42:39.839
..from Broadwick Farm,
the day the deceased was murdered.

42:40.639 --> 42:43.239
Farmer needed
some stillborn lambs collecting.

42:43.280 --> 42:45.159
Set me back an hour or so.

42:45.200 --> 42:47.560
Why didn't you mention this before?

42:47.600 --> 42:49.600
I didn't think it was important.

42:50.280 --> 42:52.119
Check inside the bags, did you?

42:52.159 --> 42:54.839
Why would I?
They're always clearly labelled.

42:55.519 --> 43:00.800
Now, the road from that farm takes
you right past our murder scene.

43:00.839 --> 43:02.560
I don't know anything about that.

43:02.600 --> 43:06.000
Mm. Now, here's something else
you don't know nothing about.

43:06.039 --> 43:07.920
DC Harry Fenton.

43:07.959 --> 43:11.000
He interviewed you four weeks ago
down at the depot.

43:11.039 --> 43:12.400
He talked to a few drivers.

43:12.439 --> 43:15.079
Aye, but none of them have
previous for violent assault.

43:15.119 --> 43:19.039
I think he was
onto this scam of yours.
Threatened to land you back inside.

43:19.079 --> 43:20.079
(DOOR OPENS)

43:21.000 --> 43:23.239
I'd like this interview
adjourned immediately

43:23.280 --> 43:25.879
for the purpose
of conferring with my client.

43:26.759 --> 43:28.159
For the benefit of the tape,

43:28.200 --> 43:32.479
William Brackley, Naz Ahmed's
solicitor, has entered the room.

43:32.759 --> 43:34.800
I only hope he's been apprised
of his rights.

43:34.839 --> 43:37.439
This man as been arrested
in connection with a murder.

43:37.479 --> 43:40.519
I'm entitled to ask him
a few preliminary questions.

43:40.560 --> 43:43.600
Well, if you had any evidence,
you would have charged him by now.

43:43.639 --> 43:47.239
What I do have
is a suspect with form

43:47.280 --> 43:51.400
who was interviewed by the
deceased in connection with a theft.

43:51.439 --> 43:54.360
We have proof of his involvement
in criminal activity.

43:54.400 --> 43:57.879
And a body retrieved
from an abattoir furnace.

43:57.920 --> 44:02.839
The abattoir your client delivered to
on the day the deceased was killed.

44:04.839 --> 44:08.439
Believe me, sunshine, you're
not going anywhere any time soon.

44:10.159 --> 44:12.159
Ma'am.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.519
Who told that brief
we'd arrested Naz Ahmed?

44:15.560 --> 44:18.360
He just turned up at the front desk
and demanded to see him.

44:18.400 --> 44:20.639
He's hardly your typical solicitor,
is he?

44:20.680 --> 44:23.560
Well, he didn't buy that suit
on a legal aid salary.

44:23.600 --> 44:25.600
Wouldn't cover his dry cleaning.

44:28.039 --> 44:32.360
Ma'am. Ma'am.
So who's picking up the tab?

44:32.400 --> 44:34.200
Forensics have had a breakthrough.

44:34.239 --> 44:35.720
Yeah, go on, I'm listening.

44:35.759 --> 44:38.159
They lifted fibres
from the haulage truck

44:38.200 --> 44:40.600
that match those
found at the crime scene.

44:40.639 --> 44:43.119
Proof that the body
was in that truck?

44:44.879 --> 44:47.319
Kenny, get a forensic team
up to Broadwick Farm,

44:47.360 --> 44:49.319
where Naz made that pick-up.

44:49.360 --> 44:51.479
And get up there yourself.
Keep an eye on them.

44:51.519 --> 44:53.560
First thing tomorrow morning.
Ma'am.

44:53.600 --> 44:56.479
Mark, run a search
on this Slick Willie.

44:56.519 --> 44:58.519
See where he's crawled out from.

44:58.879 --> 45:02.400
There's nothing to tie him
to Harry's murder.
If he's guilty, we'll find it.

45:02.439 --> 45:04.439
OK, maybe I came on too strong.

45:06.439 --> 45:08.439
Try telling that to the boss.

45:08.479 --> 45:10.600
I just want to find out
who killed him.

45:14.439 --> 45:15.720
How about a drink after work?

45:15.759 --> 45:17.800
There might be something
I can add to the mix.

45:17.839 --> 45:21.319
Aiden! Get yourself
over to Naz Ahmed's flat.

45:21.360 --> 45:23.360
Looking for a murder weapon.

45:25.439 --> 45:27.439
Looks like I'm working late.

45:38.839 --> 45:40.839
(MURMER OF CONVERSATION)

45:40.879 --> 45:42.879
We've got a visitor.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.159
Can I help you?
Ah, Mr Acreman?

45:48.519 --> 45:50.519
Aye.
Ah...

45:51.319 --> 45:53.319
I'm DCI Vera Stanhope.

45:54.159 --> 45:56.119
I'm sorry for the intrusion, sir.

45:56.159 --> 45:59.439
I assume this is
about the fraud enquiry?

45:59.479 --> 46:01.479
Ah, no, I'm from Major Crime.

46:02.680 --> 46:03.959
Investigating a murder.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.800
But we've reason to believe
the two cases could be connected.

46:07.839 --> 46:09.759
I heard you'd made an arrest
at the yard.

46:09.800 --> 46:12.720
Aye, on suspicion
of money laundering.

46:12.759 --> 46:14.479
One of the drivers at the moment,

46:14.519 --> 46:17.319
working in collusion
with the forewoman, Gill Crowley.

46:17.360 --> 46:19.319
No, No. You've got that wrong.

46:19.360 --> 46:21.400
Gill's been on the payroll
for years.

46:21.439 --> 46:23.439
Well, that's as may be, sir.

46:23.479 --> 46:27.720
But she's absconded.
Whereabouts unknown.

46:27.759 --> 46:31.479
Surely you must have known the police
were questioning the drivers.

46:31.519 --> 46:33.720
I've taken a step back
in recent years.

46:34.800 --> 46:36.439
More hands-off, these days.

46:37.159 --> 46:41.400
So you wouldn't have come across
this driver, Naz Ahmed?

46:41.959 --> 46:43.479
No?

46:43.519 --> 46:45.800
He has a record
for violent assault.

46:45.839 --> 46:48.839
No. The running of the yard
is all down to Gill.

46:51.119 --> 46:53.720
Now, this is the fella
who was murdered.

46:53.759 --> 46:55.759
A copper. Name of Harry Fenton.

46:55.800 --> 46:57.400
Aye. I heard.

46:57.439 --> 47:00.280
Ah, course.
You sent his widow flowers.

47:00.319 --> 47:01.680
That would be my PA.

47:01.720 --> 47:04.400
A charitable gesture
on behalf of the company.

47:04.439 --> 47:07.439
You didn't know him personally, then?

47:07.479 --> 47:08.920
Well, why would I?

47:08.959 --> 47:10.959
He grew up in Sawton.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.519
It's been a while
since I've been back there.

47:14.400 --> 47:17.639
Well, he'd been investigating
these allegations of fraud,

47:17.680 --> 47:19.800
weeks leading up to his death.

47:19.839 --> 47:22.759
What, so you think he was killed
in relation to this?

47:22.800 --> 47:25.000
Aye, that's a possibility.
Grandad!

47:25.039 --> 47:27.039
You'll have to excuse me.

47:27.079 --> 47:29.959
Family get-together.
Well, don't let me keep you.

47:30.000 --> 47:33.079
Now, let me give you my card.

47:34.439 --> 47:36.560
Private number. Any developments...

47:36.600 --> 47:39.479
We'll cooperate fully
with the police. Ah, thanks.

47:39.519 --> 47:42.079
That always makes my job
just a little bit easier.

47:42.119 --> 47:45.400
And I'll give my condolences
to the Assistant Chief Constable.

47:45.439 --> 47:48.400
I've been known to play golf
with him on occasion. Hm!

48:06.239 --> 48:08.319
Just wait there a minute.
All right.

48:11.519 --> 48:12.920
Ma'am.

48:12.959 --> 48:16.680
The farmer claims he was here when
the dead livestock were collected.

48:16.720 --> 48:19.920
He said it was bagged and labelled
so he let the driver get on with it.

48:19.959 --> 48:21.600
Right.

48:21.639 --> 48:25.400
Did he confirm the driver
was Naz Ahmed?

48:25.439 --> 48:27.800
Yeah.
Yeah, he's met him a few times.

48:27.839 --> 48:29.000
Regular pick-ups.

48:29.039 --> 48:31.959
Well, ask him if he saw anyone else,
day of the murder.

48:32.000 --> 48:35.800
On his land, in the lane.
Anything out of the ordinary.

48:35.839 --> 48:37.280
Will do, ma'am.

48:38.639 --> 48:41.159
Ma'am, we've probably
lost vital evidence.

48:41.200 --> 48:42.759
All that rain won't have helped.

48:42.800 --> 48:45.920
Well, we're just gonna have
to work with what we've got.

48:47.839 --> 48:49.039
KENNY: Friday afternoon.

48:49.079 --> 48:52.959
Spot anything unusual
on the land or in the lane? No.

48:54.200 --> 48:56.519
Bit out of the way,
these containers, aren't they?

48:56.560 --> 48:59.200
They've got to be kept away
from the rest of the livestock.

48:59.239 --> 49:01.079
Bio-security guidelines.

49:01.119 --> 49:03.119
Well, anyone could have had access.

49:04.639 --> 49:08.119
I want a trace on these bins
and all these tyre tracks checked.

49:08.159 --> 49:11.319
Fenton's DNA has got
to be here somewhere.

49:11.360 --> 49:13.360
I'm on it.

49:22.639 --> 49:24.560
Kenny?
Ma'am.

49:24.600 --> 49:26.800
Dale Acreman,
what have you got on him?

49:27.560 --> 49:30.319
Erm... CEO of Acreman's Holdings.

49:30.360 --> 49:32.280
Made his money in haulage
back in the '80s.

49:32.319 --> 49:35.000
I've heard his name
whispered from time to time.

49:35.039 --> 49:37.039
Contracts for kickbacks.

49:37.079 --> 49:39.439
Slippery fish. Nothing ever sticks.

49:39.479 --> 49:42.759
What if this money laundering
went right to the top?

49:42.800 --> 49:45.759
High profile businessman?
No, too much to lose.

49:45.800 --> 49:48.920
Yeah, precisely.
I mean, how far would you go?

49:48.959 --> 49:50.159
Murder?

49:50.200 --> 49:53.920
I ran a check on Naz Ahmed's brief,
William Brackley.

49:54.959 --> 49:56.959
Practising barrister, criminal law.

49:57.439 --> 50:00.360
He's also done some work
for the Police Federation.

50:00.400 --> 50:02.400
Sounds like another
conflict of interest.

50:02.439 --> 50:04.439
Can we tie Slick Willie to Acreman?

50:05.839 --> 50:09.159
Well, he argued the defence case
on a Class Action Lawsuit.

50:09.200 --> 50:11.119
The defendant in question...

50:11.959 --> 50:13.759
Acreman's Holdings.

50:13.800 --> 50:15.800
He wasn't here for Naz Ahmed.

50:16.239 --> 50:20.239
Acreman sent him. Eyes and ears.
Wanted to know what we had on him.

50:20.280 --> 50:21.720
And we gave him the lot!

50:21.759 --> 50:24.519
Ma'am, we've got a lead on
the whereabouts of Gill Crowley.

50:24.560 --> 50:27.959
She used her cashpoint card
at a village convenience store.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.079
Fulburn. It's over in The Park.

50:30.119 --> 50:32.000
Yeah, I know where Fulburn is.

50:32.039 --> 50:36.479
Kenny, do some more digging
on Acreman.

50:36.519 --> 50:38.800
Competitors, contacts.

50:38.839 --> 50:40.800
Where he's putting his money.

50:40.839 --> 50:42.119
And what about Naz Ahmed?

50:42.159 --> 50:44.360
Nothing's come back
from the search of his flat.

50:44.400 --> 50:47.079
Yeah, well, he's still
in the frame for murder.

50:47.800 --> 50:50.600
Anyone wants us,
we'll be over in Fulburn. Ma'am.

50:51.560 --> 50:53.759
Unless there's somewhere else
you'd rather be.

50:55.239 --> 50:56.959
No. Ready when you are.

50:59.400 --> 51:02.519
That's right, just up ahead.
Thanks, love. No worries.

51:08.039 --> 51:10.879
Mark sent through some intel
on Harry Fenton's finances.

51:10.920 --> 51:13.600
Might not be important
but recently he paid for a cruise.

51:13.639 --> 51:16.159
Six weeks in the Caribbean,
first class cabin.

51:16.200 --> 51:18.759
That would have taken
a bite out of his pension.

51:18.800 --> 51:21.280
Not the red ones.
Any joy with Gill Crowley?

51:21.319 --> 51:24.000
Right, cashier said
she bought food and firewood.

51:24.039 --> 51:25.920
Didn't mention
where we might find her?

51:25.959 --> 51:28.360
Mm. Branton Burn Cottage.
Top of the hill.

51:37.280 --> 51:39.280
Find out who owns this cottage.

52:12.839 --> 52:14.800
You going somewhere, pet?

52:23.000 --> 52:25.759
Fraudulent claims for VAT repayments.

52:25.800 --> 52:28.159
All these vehicles on your books.

52:28.200 --> 52:30.079
What makes you so sure
they're not legit?

52:30.119 --> 52:31.600
We checked the registrations.

52:31.639 --> 52:33.959
Those lorries you purchased,
they don't exist.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.119
Easy way to make money disappear.

52:36.159 --> 52:38.959
And don't insult me
by denying it, love.

52:39.000 --> 52:42.000
That driver you covered for,
he's already dropped you in it.

52:42.039 --> 52:43.759
Naz wouldn't do that. He's -

52:43.800 --> 52:45.800
Ooh! You two an item, are you?!

52:46.879 --> 52:50.159
So that's why she took him on
without checking his references.

52:50.200 --> 52:52.280
I was told to hire Naz.

52:52.319 --> 52:54.759
Who by? Dale Acreman?

52:54.800 --> 52:57.239
We know this cottage
is owned by Acreman's Holdings.

52:57.280 --> 53:00.479
Yeah. Which makes me suspect
he's involved in this scam

53:00.519 --> 53:02.519
right up to his eyeballs.

53:02.560 --> 53:06.039
Who else is involved in the scam?
Gareth Hennings?

53:06.759 --> 53:07.800
Gareth?!
Yeah.

53:07.839 --> 53:09.800
(SCOFFS) He wouldn't have a clue.

53:09.839 --> 53:12.159
Well, he keeps a
record of all the deliveries.

53:12.200 --> 53:15.680
Yeah, but he knows
when to keep his mouth shut.

53:15.720 --> 53:19.000
So you don't know who it was
tipped off the police?

53:19.039 --> 53:21.400
I'd put money on Danny Welch.

53:21.439 --> 53:24.680
One of the packers. I sacked him
for being drunk on the job.

53:24.720 --> 53:27.800
You must have known
you were pushing your luck.

53:27.839 --> 53:31.639
Then along comes some nosy copper
asking awkward questions.

53:31.680 --> 53:33.720
I had nothing to do
with what happened to him.

53:33.759 --> 53:36.439
So was it Naz killed Harry Fenton?

53:36.479 --> 53:39.200
No! Well, I'll tell you
this much for nothing.

53:39.239 --> 53:42.239
He's been playing you like a fish.

54:09.519 --> 54:11.519
Just a quick chat with your mam.

54:15.839 --> 54:17.439
Aye, that's right.

54:17.479 --> 54:20.400

First class cabin.

54:50.119 --> 54:52.439
We'd scrimped and saved for years.

54:53.239 --> 54:56.560
IF we went out,
we went to the bloody club.

54:56.600 --> 54:58.920
He promised all that
was going to change.

55:00.200 --> 55:03.319
Ah, now see, here's the thing
that's been troubling me.

55:03.879 --> 55:07.560
The profile we've been building
of your husband

55:07.600 --> 55:11.200
doesn't quite stack up with
the version you've been giving us.

55:11.239 --> 55:12.800
I don't know what you mean.

55:12.839 --> 55:16.400
He lied about his whereabouts so is
there something you haven't told us?

55:16.439 --> 55:18.280
What kind of question's that?

55:18.319 --> 55:20.319
It's one I'm asking your mam.

55:22.759 --> 55:24.680
I thought he was playing away.

55:24.720 --> 55:26.119
Dad?!

55:26.159 --> 55:28.479
Don't make me laugh!
What would YOU know?

55:28.519 --> 55:30.920
You've barely shown your face
in weeks.

55:30.959 --> 55:34.039
Now, what makes you think
your husband was being unfaithful?

55:34.079 --> 55:35.239
He wasn't.

55:35.280 --> 55:37.000
Phone calls.

55:37.039 --> 55:39.039
These last two months.

55:39.360 --> 55:41.879
I'd answer. She'd always hang up.

55:41.920 --> 55:44.759
Well, if they hung up,
how'd you know it was a woman?

55:44.800 --> 55:47.400
A wife can always tell.
I can't listen to this.

55:48.200 --> 55:51.039
I put the holiday
down to a guilty conscience.

55:51.079 --> 55:53.479
Did you confront him
with your suspicions?

55:53.519 --> 55:55.239
Didn't have the guts.

55:55.280 --> 55:57.280
Didn't want to know.

55:58.079 --> 56:00.680
He loved you. You know that much.

56:02.039 --> 56:04.600
He'd changed, love,
these past couple of months.

56:06.879 --> 56:08.879
Then Friday...

56:09.439 --> 56:11.439
when he didn't come home...

56:12.479 --> 56:15.039
I thought he was with her.

56:19.239 --> 56:21.239
Night. See you tomorrow.
Bye.

56:30.200 --> 56:32.200
Have you got a minute, love?

56:40.039 --> 56:41.879
A bit cloak and dagger.

56:41.920 --> 56:43.920
I just wanted a chat.

56:45.400 --> 56:46.680
A chat about Harry.

56:48.519 --> 56:51.680
You must have worked closely him.

56:51.720 --> 56:53.119
Hm?

56:53.159 --> 56:55.000
We all did.

56:55.039 --> 56:57.039
Tight-knit team.

56:57.079 --> 57:00.600
So you might know
why he wanted off the Acreman case.

57:04.519 --> 57:08.119
Look, I just want to find out
who killed him, love.

57:09.439 --> 57:11.439
I think it might be relevant.

57:13.879 --> 57:16.479
Off the record?
If that's what it takes.

57:20.239 --> 57:22.360
It was me and Harry
doing the leg work.

57:23.039 --> 57:25.039
We only had this tip-off to go on.

57:25.879 --> 57:27.879
Anonymous call?

57:28.920 --> 57:32.600
Once we started asking questions,
I knew we were on to something.

57:33.600 --> 57:36.800
Just when things were starting to...
get a case together,

57:36.839 --> 57:40.720
it started to slide.
Harry started losing interest and...

57:42.039 --> 57:44.319
He told me that
it's not worth pursuing.

57:45.319 --> 57:46.720
It made no sense.

57:46.759 --> 57:49.079
Did you share your concerns
with the SIO?

57:50.319 --> 57:52.519
I told her there were leads
needed following up.

57:52.560 --> 57:55.079
She closes it down.
Cited a lack of evidence.

57:57.439 --> 58:00.119
I thought...
maybe she was covering for Harry.

58:01.759 --> 58:03.759
Well, that's a bit of an assumption.

58:05.039 --> 58:07.039
Unless you know something I don't?

58:10.879 --> 58:12.920
You must have looked
at Acreman's Holdings.

58:12.959 --> 58:15.400
Aye, I've thrown
a couple of heads at it.

58:15.439 --> 58:17.759
Pull out the case file
on the NUS Strikes.

58:18.680 --> 58:22.360
Picket line arrests, 1989.
1989?!

58:23.239 --> 58:25.239
That's nearly 30 years ago.

58:26.720 --> 58:28.600
Way before your time.

58:28.639 --> 58:30.639
But not before Harry's.

58:33.280 --> 58:35.280
You're after some dirt?

58:36.439 --> 58:38.560
You need to start
doing some digging.

58:46.439 --> 58:48.159
So what have you got
on Gill Crowley?

58:48.200 --> 58:52.680
She's admitted to her part in the
money laundering and we'll take
a full statement tomorrow.

58:52.720 --> 58:54.959
Did she implicate anybody else?

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
Oh, come on, Aiden. It's my case.

58:59.319 --> 59:02.439
We think Harry had a hunch
that Dale Acreman was in on it.

59:03.039 --> 59:05.039
The CEO!?

59:05.079 --> 59:07.920
He's practically retired.
You know a bit about him, then?

59:07.959 --> 59:09.079
Only by reputation.

59:09.119 --> 59:11.839
Yeah. Captain of Industry,
local lad made good.

59:12.519 --> 59:15.680
If we can tie him to this fraud rap,
you know what that means?

59:15.720 --> 59:17.439
Another promotion?

59:19.680 --> 59:22.280
We can put him away for ten years.

59:23.200 --> 59:25.039
What if we can tie him
to Harry's murder?

59:25.079 --> 59:27.119
You're seriously
saying he's in the frame?

59:27.159 --> 59:30.200
He's got the means, he's got the
motive. We just need to nail him.

59:32.800 --> 59:34.800
Ever considered a job in Fraud?

59:35.759 --> 59:37.319
Are you making me an offer?

59:38.239 --> 59:40.439
I could certainly
put a word in for you.

59:40.479 --> 59:42.920
Not sure the DCI
appreciates your talents.

59:44.720 --> 59:46.720
(PHONE BUZZES)

59:50.000 --> 59:52.839
Got to take this. Sorry.

59:52.879 --> 59:55.000
Don't keep her waiting
on my account.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Ma'am?

59:59.639 --> 1:00:01.639
Give us ten minutes, yeah?

1:00:09.119 --> 1:00:11.720
I was on my way home.
What, via the pub?

1:00:13.039 --> 1:00:16.920
So what couldn't wait?
NUS Picket line dispute, 1989.

1:00:16.959 --> 1:00:19.680
What?!
I know, that's going back.

1:00:19.720 --> 1:00:23.200
Now, Dale Acreman was charged
in connection with an assault.

1:00:24.119 --> 1:00:28.280
Union shop steward,
who later retracted his statement.

1:00:29.400 --> 1:00:31.479
Guess who the arresting officer was?

1:00:36.639 --> 1:00:38.360
DC Harry Fenton.
Mm.

1:00:38.400 --> 1:00:42.360
Now, we've been assuming
Fenton was out to nail Acreman.

1:00:43.360 --> 1:00:45.239
What if he was trying to protect him?

1:00:45.280 --> 1:00:47.400
You know what you're suggesting?
Mm!

1:00:48.639 --> 1:00:51.280
I'm suggesting DC Fenton was bent.

1:00:53.360 --> 1:00:56.000
The strike was called
over new working agreements.

1:00:56.039 --> 1:00:58.000
The Seamen's Union
blockaded the ports.

1:00:58.039 --> 1:01:00.439
Acreman gave his drivers
an ultimatum.

1:01:00.479 --> 1:01:03.360
If they didn't cross the picket line
they were out of a job.

1:01:03.400 --> 1:01:06.720
Harry and Acreman had history.
Ties that go way back.

1:01:06.759 --> 1:01:08.600
Oh, there's your conflict
of interest.

1:01:08.639 --> 1:01:10.800
Acreman was paying him
for information.

1:01:10.839 --> 1:01:12.600
So why shoot the messenger?

1:01:12.639 --> 1:01:16.720
Maybe he got greedy, Kenny.
I don't know.

1:01:16.759 --> 1:01:20.479
So I want Fenton's case files
examined again.

1:01:20.519 --> 1:01:22.720
We're looking for phone logs,
emails,

1:01:22.759 --> 1:01:25.039
anything that implicates Acreman.

1:01:25.079 --> 1:01:26.839
Now, come on, let's move it.

1:01:26.879 --> 1:01:29.400
And in the meantime,
let's keep a lid on this.

1:01:29.439 --> 1:01:32.600
And no contact
with other departments.

1:01:33.639 --> 1:01:36.439
Our priority
is finding Harry's killer.

1:01:36.479 --> 1:01:38.119
The rest'll come out in the wash.

1:01:38.159 --> 1:01:41.879
Ma'am, that list of club members
that you asked for.

1:01:41.920 --> 1:01:43.479
Couple of names flagged up.

1:01:43.519 --> 1:01:46.200
Gareth Hennings
was cautioned a few months ago.

1:01:46.239 --> 1:01:48.439
Got into a fight outside of a club.

1:01:48.479 --> 1:01:51.400
Only one other member
with previous that we know of.

1:01:51.439 --> 1:01:52.800
Danny Welch?

1:01:52.839 --> 1:01:54.839
Yeah, drunk and disorderly.

1:01:55.800 --> 1:01:58.319
That's our whistle-blower
down at the yard.

1:02:00.280 --> 1:02:01.959
He used to be a member.

1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:04.159
Spent most of his time
and his money in here.

1:02:04.200 --> 1:02:06.200
Especially after he lost his job.

1:02:06.639 --> 1:02:08.879
That'd be at the haulage Yard.
Aye, that's right.

1:02:08.920 --> 1:02:11.920
So your Gareth would have
spent a lot of time with him.

1:02:14.119 --> 1:02:16.079
Danny Welch was bad news.

1:02:16.119 --> 1:02:18.519
Couple of drinks inside him,
he'd usually kick off.

1:02:18.560 --> 1:02:21.479
Right. So can you tell us
where we can find him, love?

1:02:22.319 --> 1:02:25.439
Danny's dead.
He drowned six months ago.

1:02:39.680 --> 1:02:43.079
But why would Harry review
a case that's already closed? Hm?

1:02:43.119 --> 1:02:45.119
(RINGS DOORBELL)

1:02:45.159 --> 1:02:47.159
Wasn't even his department.

1:02:48.560 --> 1:02:50.560
(KNOCKING)

1:02:54.239 --> 1:02:56.239
We're looking for Gaynor Wyer.

1:02:56.479 --> 1:02:58.800
Is this about Danny?
Can we come in, love?

1:03:03.200 --> 1:03:05.200
He was on his way home.

1:03:05.280 --> 1:03:07.280
He was drunk.

1:03:08.479 --> 1:03:11.600
The police found his body
washed up in Barrowridge Bay.

1:03:12.959 --> 1:03:14.920
They said he fell off
the cliff path.

1:03:14.959 --> 1:03:16.879
The coroner concluded
it was an accident.

1:03:16.920 --> 1:03:18.439
Oh, yeah, easier for everyone.

1:03:19.039 --> 1:03:22.360
Meaning?
Oh, Danny Welch had it coming (!)

1:03:22.400 --> 1:03:24.400
No great loss.

1:03:26.280 --> 1:03:28.280
Never even got to see this one.

1:03:30.079 --> 1:03:32.119
Now, Harry Fenton, local copper.

1:03:32.159 --> 1:03:34.079
You must have heard
what happened to him.

1:03:34.119 --> 1:03:36.479
Yeah, I heard.

1:03:36.519 --> 1:03:39.159
Well, he'd been taking an interest
in Danny's death.

1:03:39.200 --> 1:03:40.759
Going to tell us why?

1:03:40.800 --> 1:03:43.239
I went to see Harry at the club.

1:03:44.200 --> 1:03:46.239
I asked him
to look at the case again.

1:03:46.280 --> 1:03:49.159
And what did he say to that?
He said he'd look into it.

1:03:49.200 --> 1:03:51.479
He warned me not to get my hopes up.

1:03:51.519 --> 1:03:53.519
Even stopped taking the calls.

1:03:56.319 --> 1:03:58.319
This your number?

1:03:59.720 --> 1:04:01.159
That a Pay As You Go?

1:04:01.200 --> 1:04:03.680
Yeah, his daughter warned us off
in the end.

1:04:04.360 --> 1:04:06.000
Hayley? She warned you off?

1:04:06.039 --> 1:04:08.920
Harry must have told her
I'd been giving him grief.

1:04:12.200 --> 1:04:14.200
I just needed to know.

1:04:18.159 --> 1:04:22.159
So was Danny drinking in the club,
the night he died?

1:04:22.680 --> 1:04:25.159
He would have been with his mates
from work.

1:04:25.200 --> 1:04:27.119
And did those mates know

1:04:27.159 --> 1:04:30.280
he'd tipped off the police
about the money laundering?

1:04:31.920 --> 1:04:33.920
He was angry that they'd sacked him.

1:04:34.600 --> 1:04:36.600
I told him not to make that call.

1:04:38.400 --> 1:04:42.759
Oh. Well, that wouldn't have
played out too well, would it?

1:04:47.079 --> 1:04:49.400
Danny was the whistle blower
over at the yard.

1:04:49.439 --> 1:04:51.920
Murdered for tipping off the police.
Harry was on to it.

1:04:51.959 --> 1:04:53.959
Ended up dead himself.

1:04:55.920 --> 1:04:57.920
Hang on.

1:04:59.479 --> 1:05:03.479
If this fella's drinking
at the club...night he died,

1:05:03.639 --> 1:05:05.639
headed home to Gaynor...

1:05:06.400 --> 1:05:09.280
..he was walking
in the wrong direction.

1:05:14.159 --> 1:05:16.119
HE certainly gets around.

1:05:16.159 --> 1:05:18.159
Doesn't he just?

1:05:28.159 --> 1:05:31.039
We're just friends.
Oh, none of my business, love.

1:05:33.159 --> 1:05:36.079
What was it you wanted?
Oh, just a little chat, love.

1:05:36.959 --> 1:05:38.479
About Danny Welch.

1:05:39.639 --> 1:05:41.959
We know your dad
was looking into his death.

1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:46.759
You knew it was Gaynor making those
phone calls to the house, didn't you?

1:05:48.119 --> 1:05:49.800
I had a fair idea.

1:05:49.839 --> 1:05:53.439
Well, if she's the 'other woman',
why not put your mam's mind at rest?

1:05:53.479 --> 1:05:57.159
I didn't know she suspected.
That was the first I've heard of it.

1:05:57.200 --> 1:05:59.519
Nah, I think there's
more to it than that.

1:06:02.800 --> 1:06:06.039
My dad should never
have been looking into the case.

1:06:06.079 --> 1:06:08.479
He said it was best
if we kept it between us.

1:06:10.639 --> 1:06:12.639
Did the pair of you fall out over it?

1:06:14.959 --> 1:06:17.159
He found out
I'd been round to see Gaynor.

1:06:17.200 --> 1:06:18.920
Blew up in my face.

1:06:26.479 --> 1:06:29.360
Ma'am, Dale Acreman's here for you.

1:06:29.400 --> 1:06:33.000
Said he's not used to waiting.
Needs to speak to you personally.

1:06:33.039 --> 1:06:35.319
Well, it saves us
having to bring him in.

1:06:41.759 --> 1:06:43.759
Mr Acreman.

1:06:43.800 --> 1:06:46.000
I'd like a few minutes alone
with Gill Crowley.

1:06:46.039 --> 1:06:49.039
Oh, I'm sorry, sir,
she's still being questioned.

1:06:49.079 --> 1:06:50.879
I've decided not to press charges.

1:06:50.920 --> 1:06:52.600
Wouldn't look good for the business.

1:06:52.639 --> 1:06:55.239
I'll be the one to decide
which charges to press.

1:06:55.280 --> 1:06:56.519
But since I've got you here,

1:06:56.560 --> 1:06:58.759
there's a few more questions
I'd like to ask you.

1:06:58.800 --> 1:07:00.800
I've got nothing to hide.
Hm! Good.

1:07:05.280 --> 1:07:07.280
Where were you Friday afternoon?

1:07:08.680 --> 1:07:11.879
I was at the Charity do.
My company's one of the sponsors.

1:07:17.519 --> 1:07:19.079
Danny Welch.

1:07:19.119 --> 1:07:21.200
He was sacked from your haulage yard.

1:07:21.239 --> 1:07:24.319
Now, he tipped the police off
about the money laundering.

1:07:24.360 --> 1:07:26.360
Ended up dead two weeks later.

1:07:26.400 --> 1:07:29.360
Well, as I said,
Gill did all the hiring and firing.

1:07:29.400 --> 1:07:32.959
Mm. Well, this driver she hired,

1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:37.319
currently in custody, Naz Ahmed.

1:07:37.360 --> 1:07:40.000
It was you who
put her up to hiring him.

1:07:40.800 --> 1:07:43.959
Now, that'd make me a liar.
Wouldn't it just?

1:07:46.200 --> 1:07:48.200
Harry Fenton's phone logs.

1:07:48.239 --> 1:07:51.479
Evidence he called your mobile
two weeks ago.

1:07:51.519 --> 1:07:54.319
The day before the fraud squad
drops in at the depot.

1:07:54.360 --> 1:07:58.200
Aye, a detective rang me.
Wanted to ask a few questions.

1:07:58.239 --> 1:08:01.159
A meeting was set up.
It'll all be in the diary.

1:08:01.200 --> 1:08:03.600
Didn't say what he wanted
to talk about?

1:08:03.639 --> 1:08:06.159
I assume it was the ongoing enquiry.

1:08:06.200 --> 1:08:08.200
Ah, nah, nah. No, that won't wash.

1:08:09.159 --> 1:08:12.519
DC Fenton had taken himself off
the case. Conflict of interest.

1:08:12.560 --> 1:08:14.680
Might explain why
he never turned up.

1:08:15.079 --> 1:08:20.239
Hm. Now, here's a face
you ought to recognise.

1:08:20.720 --> 1:08:22.720
Despite the cuts and bruises.

1:08:23.400 --> 1:08:25.800
Pressed charges
against you for assault.

1:08:25.839 --> 1:08:29.079
That was years ago. After
one of your heavies beat him up.

1:08:29.119 --> 1:08:30.519
Charges that were dropped.

1:08:30.560 --> 1:08:33.239
Now, why WAS that, do you reckon, hm?

1:08:34.200 --> 1:08:36.280
Because one of the officers
working the case

1:08:36.319 --> 1:08:38.800
convinced him it was
in his best interests?

1:08:39.360 --> 1:08:43.280
And in return, DC Fenton -
who you've never met -

1:08:43.319 --> 1:08:46.079
gets hold of a list
of known agitators,

1:08:46.119 --> 1:08:48.800
several of whom are banged up.
That's all conjecture.

1:08:48.839 --> 1:08:51.519
And you've been greasing his palm
ever since, haven't you?

1:08:51.560 --> 1:08:54.079
Backhanders, bribes,
Call it what you will.

1:08:54.119 --> 1:08:55.239
Libellous speculation.

1:08:55.280 --> 1:08:59.000
You're up to your eyeballs
in this money laundering scam!

1:08:59.039 --> 1:09:00.639
Harry tips you the wink.

1:09:00.680 --> 1:09:02.759
Two weeks later he's murdered

1:09:02.800 --> 1:09:06.839
and his body delivered to
that abattoir in one of your trucks.

1:09:07.759 --> 1:09:10.239
You don't know
who you're dealing with here.

1:09:10.280 --> 1:09:12.280
I'd like to make a phone call.

1:09:12.319 --> 1:09:13.439
William Brackley?

1:09:13.479 --> 1:09:16.119
Oh, expect you've got your brief
on speed dial.

1:09:16.159 --> 1:09:18.159
You're gonna need him, pet.

1:09:28.200 --> 1:09:31.479
His alibi stacks up. He was
definitely at the charity lunch.

1:09:33.600 --> 1:09:37.280
Well, a man like Acreman, he's not
gonna get his hands dirty, is he?

1:09:37.319 --> 1:09:38.800
Ma'am?
What?

1:09:38.839 --> 1:09:40.800
William Brackley's demanding
to see you.

1:09:41.959 --> 1:09:43.959
Is he indeed?!

1:09:46.200 --> 1:09:48.000
Get on to that charity website.

1:09:48.039 --> 1:09:51.680
See if you can find out
what time Acreman left that do.

1:09:58.000 --> 1:09:59.759
Ah, Mr Brackley.

1:09:59.800 --> 1:10:04.639
YOU have no right to question HIM
without a legal representative.

1:10:04.680 --> 1:10:08.319
Ah, no, your client
agreed to a voluntary interview.

1:10:08.360 --> 1:10:12.280
And I won't be taking
a lecture on ethics from you.

1:10:12.319 --> 1:10:13.879
What's that supposed to mean?

1:10:13.920 --> 1:10:17.239
I know you passed on details
of Naz Ahmed's interview

1:10:17.280 --> 1:10:20.839
and that's a clear breach
of client confidentiality.

1:10:20.879 --> 1:10:24.560
Yes, but you can't prove anything.
Maybe not.

1:10:24.600 --> 1:10:27.639
But I will be passing on
my concerns to the Bar Council.

1:10:27.680 --> 1:10:30.959
So you'd better watch your step,
sunshine.

1:11:21.360 --> 1:11:23.079
I could have come
down to the station.

1:11:23.119 --> 1:11:25.600
I wanted to keep it between us.
There you go.

1:11:26.959 --> 1:11:28.759
OK. I'm all ears.

1:11:28.800 --> 1:11:31.280
You said you'd never met
Dale Acreman.

1:11:33.400 --> 1:11:34.879
I think I'd have remembered.

1:11:34.920 --> 1:11:36.920
That charity lunch
you attended last week,

1:11:36.959 --> 1:11:39.119
his company was one of the sponsors.

1:11:39.159 --> 1:11:41.159
Been checking up on me?

1:11:42.119 --> 1:11:44.439
Saw your name on the guest list,
that's all.

1:11:44.479 --> 1:11:47.879
Well, if Acreman was there,
I certainly didn't speak to him.

1:11:52.200 --> 1:11:54.680
You dragged me down here
just to ask me that?

1:12:00.200 --> 1:12:03.479
Something's come to light
in the course of our enquiries.

1:12:03.959 --> 1:12:05.720
Concerning DC Fenton.

1:12:05.759 --> 1:12:07.879
Is this about
his conflict of interest?

1:12:07.920 --> 1:12:09.959
No. I think he might
have been corrupt.

1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:12.879
Harry? No. No way.
You seem pretty sure about that.

1:12:12.920 --> 1:12:14.920
Yeah, I worked alongside him 24/7.

1:12:15.839 --> 1:12:17.560
He might have had his faults
but bent?

1:12:17.600 --> 1:12:19.119
No chance. Not in a million years.

1:12:19.159 --> 1:12:22.879
We know that he made contact with
Dale Acreman weeks before he died.

1:12:22.920 --> 1:12:26.200
I think he deliberately
misled the fraud investigation.

1:12:26.239 --> 1:12:28.239
I take it you can back this up?

1:12:28.280 --> 1:12:31.680
That warrant that you applied for
to audit the haulage yard,

1:12:31.720 --> 1:12:33.560
someone else saw fit to make a copy.

1:12:34.879 --> 1:12:38.759
All warrants are tagged
and recorded, you know that.
Harry wouldn't be that stupid.

1:12:38.800 --> 1:12:40.639
I'm guessing he took it
to Dale Acreman.

1:12:40.680 --> 1:12:42.360
But you don't have any proof.

1:12:42.400 --> 1:12:43.720
Redacted phone logs.

1:12:43.759 --> 1:12:47.119
Missing transcripts
of witness statements.

1:12:47.159 --> 1:12:49.159
He was trying to hide the evidence.

1:12:49.200 --> 1:12:51.079
Covering his tracks.

1:12:51.119 --> 1:12:53.119
Who else knows about this?

1:12:53.920 --> 1:12:55.920
Right now, just the two of us.

1:12:58.039 --> 1:13:00.079
Do us a favour
and keep it that way.

1:13:01.319 --> 1:13:03.360
I'm going to have to share this
with the boss.

1:13:03.400 --> 1:13:05.680
Just let me do some digging.
A couple of hours.

1:13:07.920 --> 1:13:11.200
If one of my team
was on the take, I'm best placed
to bring it to light.

1:13:11.239 --> 1:13:13.639
Anyone else,
the whole unit's tarnished.

1:13:16.119 --> 1:13:17.119
Aiden.

1:13:23.639 --> 1:13:27.360
Couple of hours,
then I'm taking it to the DCI.

1:13:29.319 --> 1:13:31.039
I'll let you know
what I come up with.

1:13:43.360 --> 1:13:46.280
How did that go?
I think she took the bait.

1:14:31.159 --> 1:14:34.239
You see, the thing
about modern policing, love,

1:14:34.280 --> 1:14:37.159
is that there's always a trail
when you look for it.

1:14:37.879 --> 1:14:39.839
Like these phone calls
you've been making

1:14:39.879 --> 1:14:41.879
to a man you've never met.

1:14:42.039 --> 1:14:45.560
Deleting these emails
might buy you some time, love.

1:14:45.600 --> 1:14:48.360
But I know a rotten apple
when I smell one.

1:14:51.560 --> 1:14:54.839
I'll talk. But not here.

1:14:57.600 --> 1:14:59.920
Harry didn't ask
to be taken off the case.

1:14:59.959 --> 1:15:02.759
It was you wanted him
out of the loop.

1:15:02.800 --> 1:15:06.280
You were afraid this fraud case
was gonna blow up in your face.

1:15:07.319 --> 1:15:09.959
Now here you are
obstructing a murder investigation.

1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:12.079
I did nothing to compromise
your case.

1:15:12.119 --> 1:15:14.039
Nothing?! You tipped off Acreman!

1:15:14.079 --> 1:15:16.079
Told him we'd made an arrest.

1:15:16.560 --> 1:15:18.839
20 minutes later,
that lawyer turns up.

1:15:20.759 --> 1:15:22.959
So what was it Acreman
offered you, eh?

1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:25.720
Hm? A leg up the ladder?

1:15:25.759 --> 1:15:27.759
Dinner with the ACC?

1:15:29.680 --> 1:15:32.560
We'd been investigating
a private security firm.

1:15:33.439 --> 1:15:35.039
They had a contract with Acreman.

1:15:35.280 --> 1:15:37.280
Construction sites, door work.

1:15:38.319 --> 1:15:41.000
The manager
had form for tax evasion.

1:15:41.039 --> 1:15:44.519
And...in the course
of our investigation,

1:15:44.560 --> 1:15:49.600
this manager and I...
we got a bit too close.

1:15:49.639 --> 1:15:52.079
So Acreman was blackmailing you.

1:15:52.119 --> 1:15:54.319
Let's just say he used his leverage.

1:15:54.360 --> 1:15:57.600
So why didn't you take it upstairs,
love? Hm?

1:15:57.920 --> 1:16:00.600
Fess up to your mistake.
He's got friends in high places.

1:16:00.639 --> 1:16:03.479
I hardly think they'd have
given me the benefit of the doubt.

1:16:03.519 --> 1:16:06.119
Well, you'll never find that out now,
will you?

1:16:09.239 --> 1:16:11.239
Tell me something.

1:16:12.039 --> 1:16:14.439
Do you think Acreman
killed Harry Fenton?

1:16:17.159 --> 1:16:19.439
I've been asking myself
the same question.

1:16:21.239 --> 1:16:23.639
They're gonna want
your warrant card, love.

1:16:32.239 --> 1:16:33.879
I never meant to lie to you.

1:16:33.920 --> 1:16:37.400
You played me.
You're no better than he is.

1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:45.360
There's enough on there to
implicate Acreman in serious fraud.

1:16:45.400 --> 1:16:47.639
If I'm going down,
I'm taking him with me.

1:17:05.079 --> 1:17:08.280
JESSE: Harry and me were
born within weeks of each other.

1:17:09.439 --> 1:17:11.319
Even then I was
a few pounds heavier.

1:17:11.360 --> 1:17:13.360
(POLITE LAUGHTER)

1:17:15.039 --> 1:17:17.039
I remember us as kids.

1:17:17.800 --> 1:17:19.200
We'd comb the beach together.

1:17:19.239 --> 1:17:21.079
Wagging school for some crabbing.

1:17:23.959 --> 1:17:25.959
Growing up, married...

1:17:26.879 --> 1:17:28.000
Kids.

1:17:28.039 --> 1:17:30.039
We'd allus look out for our own.

1:17:31.280 --> 1:17:33.280
Allus look out for each other.

1:17:35.720 --> 1:17:38.439
Well, the people at the club,
they were like family.

1:17:38.479 --> 1:17:39.959
You ask anyone sitting here.

1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:43.319
They'll all tell you,
Harry was one of the good guys.

1:17:43.360 --> 1:17:45.360
ALL: Hear, hear!

1:17:45.600 --> 1:17:47.200
One of the best.

1:18:17.239 --> 1:18:19.119
Something going on
we should know about?

1:18:19.159 --> 1:18:21.159
Ah, not for me to say.

1:18:22.439 --> 1:18:23.959
You'll find out soon enough.

1:18:29.839 --> 1:18:32.000
If people here
knew I'd been talking...

1:18:32.039 --> 1:18:34.039
Off the record, wasn't it?

1:18:35.360 --> 1:18:37.079
I'd be finished in this nick.

1:18:37.119 --> 1:18:39.319
Well, they'll not hear it from me.

1:18:41.319 --> 1:18:43.839
Danny Welch.
That name mean anything to you?

1:18:46.119 --> 1:18:48.319
He was found on a beach
a few months ago.

1:18:48.360 --> 1:18:50.600
Death by Misadventure.

1:18:50.639 --> 1:18:52.639
Barrowridge Bay, right?
Yeah.

1:18:53.439 --> 1:18:56.239
Did you know DC Fenton
was looking into that case?

1:18:57.879 --> 1:18:59.720
Come on, love. It's important.

1:18:59.759 --> 1:19:02.680
He said it was personal.
Something to do with a mate.

1:19:06.400 --> 1:19:08.400
That's still off the record!

1:19:11.360 --> 1:19:13.360
(SIRENS)

1:19:24.119 --> 1:19:26.119
We've got something.

1:19:26.159 --> 1:19:28.159
Kenny, I need these tyres checked.

1:19:28.200 --> 1:19:31.720
We're looking for a match to the
treads found at the murder scene.

1:19:31.759 --> 1:19:33.400
Are you sure you wanna do this now?

1:19:33.439 --> 1:19:36.560
What? Wouldn't be a proper wake
without an arrest or two.

1:19:40.159 --> 1:19:44.839
I thought maybe...
I could take you out...one night.

1:19:44.879 --> 1:19:46.879
Just the two of us.

1:19:47.280 --> 1:19:49.200
This really isn't the time, Gareth.

1:19:49.239 --> 1:19:50.400
Why not?

1:19:50.439 --> 1:19:52.239
After everything that's happened.

1:19:54.119 --> 1:19:55.280
Gareth Hennings!

1:19:55.319 --> 1:19:58.839
We need to question you in connection
with the death of DC Harry Fenton.

1:19:58.879 --> 1:20:00.839
What? We're in the middle of a wake!
Come on.

1:20:00.879 --> 1:20:02.319
I didn't do it!

1:20:02.360 --> 1:20:05.600
Everyone just stay calm. Thank you.
You're not taking him anywhere!

1:20:05.639 --> 1:20:08.159
Well, you'd better find us
somewhere we can talk, love.

1:20:08.200 --> 1:20:10.200
Before this lot decide to lynch him.

1:20:10.759 --> 1:20:11.879
Upstairs!

1:20:11.920 --> 1:20:13.920
(GASPS)
WOMAN: What's going on?

1:20:17.680 --> 1:20:19.680
Stay there.

1:20:20.920 --> 1:20:22.639
Now, then, Gareth, pet.

1:20:24.159 --> 1:20:26.400
You were cautioned by the police
a few months ago.

1:20:26.439 --> 1:20:28.239
Bit of a kick-off, down in the club.

1:20:28.280 --> 1:20:31.439
Couple of punters
had a pop at each other.

1:20:31.479 --> 1:20:33.400
Aye, but then you got stuck in.

1:20:33.439 --> 1:20:35.839
I was only trying to break it up.
Mm.

1:20:37.039 --> 1:20:39.920
Danny Welch
ever give you any grief? Hm?

1:20:40.479 --> 1:20:44.200
Your mam said he was trouble,
After he'd had a few.

1:20:46.239 --> 1:20:48.239
Danny had a dirty mouth.

1:20:48.280 --> 1:20:50.280
Liked to throw his weight about.

1:20:51.280 --> 1:20:54.839
Now, night Danny was found dead,

1:20:56.280 --> 1:20:58.560
you'd been drinking in the bar
together.

1:20:59.759 --> 1:21:01.519
He might have popped in.

1:21:01.560 --> 1:21:03.200
I cannot remember.

1:21:03.239 --> 1:21:05.600
Oh, I think you remember, love.

1:21:05.639 --> 1:21:08.720
Cos you followed him out of the club
at closing time, didn't you?

1:21:08.759 --> 1:21:10.680
Parked up on the prom.

1:21:10.720 --> 1:21:13.479
And we've got proof.
That the club van?

1:21:13.519 --> 1:21:17.039
So? I went for a drive.

1:21:17.079 --> 1:21:18.759
What with a skinful of beer?

1:21:20.519 --> 1:21:23.920
He was headed over to Hayley's.
Try his luck, he said.

1:21:23.959 --> 1:21:26.759
Ah, well, I can see you'd
have to put a stop to that.

1:21:27.680 --> 1:21:30.319
Mm. Lost your temper.
No!

1:21:31.639 --> 1:21:33.639
It was his fault!

1:21:34.159 --> 1:21:37.159
He called me a loser. Said
Hayley wouldn't look at me twice.

1:21:37.200 --> 1:21:39.200
Is that when you punched him?

1:21:39.959 --> 1:21:42.000
I'm saying nothing!

1:21:42.039 --> 1:21:44.280
My mam told us not to.

1:21:44.319 --> 1:21:46.479
Well, that's cos
she's trying to protect you.

1:21:46.519 --> 1:21:51.039
Gareth, I think it's time
you told us the truth, don't you?

1:21:58.239 --> 1:22:00.239
(SOBS)

1:22:02.759 --> 1:22:04.759
It was an accident, I swear.

1:22:07.920 --> 1:22:11.000
If he hadn't have been pissed,
he'd never have fallen.

1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:18.000
So when did Harry find out
what had really happened? Hm?

1:22:20.639 --> 1:22:21.720
He didn't.

1:22:23.439 --> 1:22:24.959
We didn't tell anyone.

1:22:26.759 --> 1:22:29.680
Because I think you killed him
to cover your tracks.

1:22:30.800 --> 1:22:34.400
Dumped his body in with a pile
of dead sheep up at Broadwick Farm.

1:22:36.400 --> 1:22:38.400
They found his body at Brenkley!

1:22:38.439 --> 1:22:39.600
The abattoir.

1:22:39.639 --> 1:22:42.079
Ah, because that's
where you knew he'd end up.

1:22:42.119 --> 1:22:46.479
In Naz Ahmed's lorry. You wrote
it all down on your job sheets.

1:22:46.519 --> 1:22:49.280
I was here, at the club,
all evening.

1:22:49.319 --> 1:22:51.319
Ask my mam. She'll tell you.

1:22:53.079 --> 1:22:55.159
We had Harry's send-off to organise.

1:22:55.200 --> 1:22:59.280
So you're telling us you were here
all evening with your mam and dad?

1:22:59.319 --> 1:23:01.319
My dad got back around seven.

1:23:04.959 --> 1:23:06.920
Got back?

1:23:06.959 --> 1:23:08.600
Back from where, love?

1:23:08.639 --> 1:23:10.639
Cash and carry.

1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:13.000
Oh.

1:23:16.560 --> 1:23:18.560
These job sheets.

1:23:18.920 --> 1:23:20.839
You ever take them home with you?

1:23:20.879 --> 1:23:22.720
Aye.

1:23:22.759 --> 1:23:24.560
Why do you do that?

1:23:25.439 --> 1:23:31.000
My dad needs to check 'em for us.
Make sure I've got things right.

1:23:54.439 --> 1:23:57.039
Ma'am. You're not doing this
without backup.

1:23:57.079 --> 1:23:58.959
I'll call you if I need you.

1:24:10.439 --> 1:24:14.119
Your son's just confessed to his
part in the death of Danny Welch.

1:24:16.400 --> 1:24:18.680
Our lad gets confused.

1:24:18.720 --> 1:24:20.720
Is that why you covered for him?

1:24:23.639 --> 1:24:27.439
Look, it's all gonna come out,
so you might as well tell me.

1:24:29.720 --> 1:24:31.439
I didn't have a choice.

1:24:31.479 --> 1:24:33.920
Yes, you did.

1:24:33.959 --> 1:24:35.959
You chose to cover it up.

1:24:38.920 --> 1:24:41.600
Came home in a state.
Told us what had happened.

1:24:43.239 --> 1:24:45.039
I swear I was all set
to ring the police.

1:24:45.079 --> 1:24:49.119
It was Eileen stopped us.
Said if I did, it was prison.

1:24:50.039 --> 1:24:52.439
Well, I'm not sure
I fancy his chances now.

1:24:53.720 --> 1:24:55.720
Been living with it for months.

1:24:56.680 --> 1:24:58.680
Nothing mentioned.

1:24:58.720 --> 1:25:00.720
Nothing said.

1:25:01.360 --> 1:25:05.759
And then Harry finds your
number plates caught on camera.

1:25:05.800 --> 1:25:08.519
If that lass of Danny's
had just left it alone...

1:25:08.560 --> 1:25:10.560
I told him no good
would come of it.

1:25:10.600 --> 1:25:13.600
Ah, Harry knew
you were hiding something.

1:25:16.360 --> 1:25:18.360
His murder took some planning.

1:25:20.280 --> 1:25:23.000
I don't think your Gareth
has got the nous for it.

1:25:24.680 --> 1:25:29.519
So why don't you help me
to clear your son's name? Hm?

1:25:30.720 --> 1:25:33.079
Harry told me
I had to turn Gareth in.

1:25:35.360 --> 1:25:37.000
24 hours, he said.

1:25:37.039 --> 1:25:40.000
If I didn't,
he was going to arrest him.

1:25:41.039 --> 1:25:43.360
So you arranged to meet him
up on the moor.

1:25:44.079 --> 1:25:47.079
Nothing a walk couldn't solve.
Ah, not this time, eh?

1:25:48.079 --> 1:25:51.079
Just wanted to talk to him.
Try and get him to see sense.

1:25:51.119 --> 1:25:54.639
You took a gun with you.
Every intention of killing him.

1:25:54.680 --> 1:25:57.680
He brought it on himself.
Your best mate.

1:25:57.720 --> 1:25:59.720
He should never have made me choose.

1:26:00.239 --> 1:26:03.280
Just dumped his body
and left it to burn.

1:26:07.039 --> 1:26:10.720
I couldn't turn Gareth in.
My own flesh and blood.

1:26:15.439 --> 1:26:18.159
All those years - me and Harry.

1:26:19.600 --> 1:26:21.600
Should have counted for something.

1:26:23.119 --> 1:26:25.720
He could have just...let it go.

1:26:26.680 --> 1:26:31.959
Oh, well, the trouble was, Harry
couldn't just let it go, could he?

1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:34.079
And you knew that better than anyone.

1:26:35.800 --> 1:26:37.159
Copper to the core.

1:26:39.519 --> 1:26:41.519
(RECITES CAUTION)

1:27:42.639 --> 1:27:44.600
One day you might learn to trust me.

1:27:44.639 --> 1:27:46.079
What's that supposed to mean?

1:27:46.119 --> 1:27:48.039
He could have had that gun
in his pocket.

1:27:48.079 --> 1:27:51.759
Well, he didn't...luckily.

1:27:51.800 --> 1:27:54.600
Still bowled on in there,
not so much as a second thought.

1:27:54.639 --> 1:27:56.639
Sounds like DI Chandra talking.

1:27:57.800 --> 1:27:59.560
Go on, say it.
Say what?

1:27:59.600 --> 1:28:01.400
I'm a bad judge of character.

1:28:01.439 --> 1:28:04.439
Well, that'd be judging
after the fact, wouldn't it?

1:28:05.639 --> 1:28:08.759
Besides, I got DC Fenton all wrong,
didn't I?

1:28:10.479 --> 1:28:13.000
Turns out to be the fella
they all said he was.

1:28:18.239 --> 1:28:20.239
You know she offered us a job?

1:28:21.600 --> 1:28:23.600
Did she?

1:28:26.439 --> 1:28:28.439
Well, at least she had good taste.

1:28:30.079 --> 1:28:31.759
Tempted were you?

1:28:32.920 --> 1:28:34.920
I was flattered.

1:28:36.439 --> 1:28:37.600
Thought about it.

1:28:39.600 --> 1:28:43.600
And then I thought...
Nah, better off with old-school.

1:28:47.639 --> 1:28:49.119
Do you want a lift?

1:28:49.159 --> 1:28:50.920
You gonna let me drive for once?

1:28:50.959 --> 1:28:52.959
Pff! Over my dead body.

1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:55.000
(CHUCKLES)

1:28:56.239 --> 1:28:58.239
Are you coming?
