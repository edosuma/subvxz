WEBVTT

00:03.126 --> 00:04.619
So, how does this game work?

00:04.619 --> 00:06.252
I just throw it,
like a real ball?

00:06.254 --> 00:08.771
Yeah, just nice and easy,
right over the plate.

00:08.773 --> 00:10.673
All right.

00:10.675 --> 00:13.159
You suck, Wolowitz!

00:13.161 --> 00:15.028
What's that about?

00:15.030 --> 00:16.196
I'm heckling you.

00:16.198 --> 00:17.747
It's a beloved part
of baseball.

00:17.749 --> 00:19.532
He's right.

00:19.534 --> 00:20.950
And given that you're
probably still waiting

00:20.952 --> 00:22.902
to be picked for a game that
was played in fifth grade,

00:22.904 --> 00:24.988
I'm sure you do suck.

00:26.041 --> 00:27.490
Hi. What's going on?

00:27.492 --> 00:28.575
Baseball.

00:28.577 --> 00:30.577
Okay, this is not
what I meant when I said

00:30.579 --> 00:31.861
go outside and play.

00:31.863 --> 00:33.746
He's practicing.

00:33.748 --> 00:34.714
For what?

00:34.716 --> 00:37.083
The Angels wanted an astronaut

00:37.085 --> 00:38.635
to throw out the first pitch,

00:38.637 --> 00:40.420
so guess who they called?

00:40.422 --> 00:41.955
What, you? Really?!

00:41.957 --> 00:45.425
Well, a lot of people who
weren't available, but then me!

00:46.661 --> 00:47.677
That's so cool!

00:47.679 --> 00:48.845
Congratulations.

00:48.847 --> 00:50.980
I guess that makes you
the athlete of the group.

00:50.982 --> 00:52.932
Well, not just him!

00:52.934 --> 00:55.568
May I remind you that you're
talking to the seeker, beater,

00:55.570 --> 00:57.604
chaser and water boy

00:57.606 --> 01:00.773
of the third place
Griffith Park Quidditch team.

01:00.775 --> 01:01.941
I know.

01:01.943 --> 01:03.610
Watching your boyfriend
run around with a broomstick

01:03.612 --> 01:06.062
between his legs
isn't something you forget.

01:07.198 --> 01:08.331
C'mon now,
throw one.

01:08.333 --> 01:10.700
All right,
here we go.

01:10.702 --> 01:12.952
You look like a jackass!

01:12.954 --> 01:15.004
Cut it out!
You're hurting my feelings!

01:15.006 --> 01:17.874
Now you know why
we're not outside.

<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

01:47.502 --> 01:49.567
Did you enjoy
my lecture?

01:49.568 --> 01:51.985
No, and neither did
our waiter.

01:53.656 --> 01:56.156
Well, if you're going to
serve Cornish game hen,

01:56.158 --> 01:58.742
you should either be familiar
with the history of Cornwall

01:58.744 --> 02:00.194
or be prepared
to learn it.

02:01.664 --> 02:02.946
It's hard to argue with that.

02:02.948 --> 02:05.749
And I know because I saw a
sad man with a pepper mill

02:05.751 --> 02:07.868
desperately try and fail.

02:12.875 --> 02:14.007
Hey, how was dinner?

02:14.009 --> 02:16.426
Good, I had Cornish game hen.

02:16.428 --> 02:19.012
Oh, that poor waiter.

02:20.633 --> 02:22.800
Sheldon, how about tomorrow
night we see a movie?

02:22.802 --> 02:24.635
You guys are going out
two nights in a row?

02:24.637 --> 02:28.605
I missed a number of date nights
while I was on my train trip,

02:28.607 --> 02:30.808
and I'm contractually
obligated to make them up

02:30.810 --> 02:33.277
under the terms of the
Relationship Agreement.

02:34.146 --> 02:36.346
That's so hot.

02:36.348 --> 02:39.566
It's better than hot,
it's binding.

02:41.220 --> 02:43.287
If you're free
tomorrow night,

02:43.289 --> 02:45.572
I'd love to have you
join us on a double date.

02:45.574 --> 02:46.974
Aw...

02:46.976 --> 02:51.128
You are aware that a double date
doesn't count as two dates.

02:52.331 --> 02:54.131
Oh.

02:54.133 --> 02:55.382
Well, then come
or don't.

02:55.384 --> 02:56.583
I don't care.

03:00.389 --> 03:03.257
I can't believe you're sore.

03:03.259 --> 03:06.643
Hey, even professional pitchers
need a rubdown after the game.

03:08.180 --> 03:09.897
But they throw
an actual ball.

03:09.899 --> 03:12.816
You were throwing
air at a TV.

03:14.270 --> 03:15.485
For your information,

03:15.487 --> 03:18.655
I also gave Leonard
one hell of a high five.

03:18.657 --> 03:20.858
I'm kind of surprised
you agreed to do this

03:20.860 --> 03:22.743
in front of a stadium
full of people.

03:22.745 --> 03:25.245
They're doing Space Day
and NASA asked me.

03:25.247 --> 03:26.697
I felt like I couldn't say no.

03:26.699 --> 03:27.865
Okay.

03:27.867 --> 03:29.700
Well, if you want,
I could help you practice.

03:29.702 --> 03:31.368
I played a lot of softball
growing up.

03:31.370 --> 03:33.670
Thank you, that
would be great.

03:33.672 --> 03:34.955
Great.
And while we're at it,

03:34.957 --> 03:36.206
maybe we could butch up your run

03:36.208 --> 03:37.791
for when you head out
to the mound.

03:39.178 --> 03:41.094
What's wrong with the way I run?

03:41.096 --> 03:42.179
Oh, just kidding.

03:42.181 --> 03:43.380
Nothing.

03:51.557 --> 03:54.942
Sheldon, I'm surprised
you'd choose to go to a pub.

03:54.944 --> 03:56.643
At our committee meeting,

03:56.645 --> 03:59.196
Amy made a motion
for a picnic in a park,

03:59.198 --> 04:01.531
but I tacked so many amendments
on that thing

04:01.533 --> 04:03.867
it sank like a lead balloon.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.953
I then suggested a pub.

04:05.955 --> 04:08.238
Yeah, which I was
initially skeptical of until

04:08.240 --> 04:11.291
I saw online that they serve
Yorkshire pudding.

04:11.293 --> 04:13.410
You don't even like
Yorkshire pudding.

04:13.412 --> 04:14.544
No, it's yucky,

04:14.546 --> 04:17.247
but informing people about
the history of Yorkshire

04:17.249 --> 04:19.216
is yummy, yum-yum.

04:19.218 --> 04:21.918
After a lively debate,

04:21.921 --> 04:25.005
that proposal passed
by a two-zero margin.

04:25.007 --> 04:27.224
Nice to see a busy couple

04:27.226 --> 04:28.425
keep the spark
of bureaucracy alive.

04:31.180 --> 04:33.597
Ignore them, Amy.
They're just jealous

04:33.599 --> 04:36.767
because they'll never have
a relationship as good as ours.

04:38.187 --> 04:41.822
Isn't this when he says
“bazooka” or something?

04:41.824 --> 04:43.523
I wasn't
making a joke,

04:43.525 --> 04:45.492
I was merely
stating fact.

04:45.494 --> 04:49.363
Amy and I have a superior
relationship to yours.

04:49.365 --> 04:51.698
You don't honestly
think that, do you?

04:51.700 --> 04:53.333
Y... Leonard,

04:53.335 --> 04:55.669
I assumed you knew.

04:56.672 --> 04:58.505
The ranking of
relationships in our circle

04:58.507 --> 05:00.841
by quality is:
me and Amy,

05:00.843 --> 05:03.677
Howard and Bernadette,
Raj and his girlfriend,

05:03.679 --> 05:06.513
Penny and Chardonnay,
Penny and you.

05:09.134 --> 05:11.101
There isn't any ranking.

05:11.103 --> 05:14.104
And if there were, we wouldn't
be at the bottom of it.

05:14.106 --> 05:16.940
Yeah, and actually,
I drink Sauvignon Blanc.

05:18.811 --> 05:20.811
That's the part
you have a problem with?

05:20.813 --> 05:22.729
Relax.

05:22.731 --> 05:25.649
There they go,
fighting again.

05:25.651 --> 05:28.485
You'd never hear her talk
that way to Sauvignon Blanc.

05:31.790 --> 05:34.074
So you never played
baseball as a kid,

05:34.076 --> 05:35.909
not even
Little League?

05:35.911 --> 05:37.995
Well, I was going to,
but the day of tryouts

05:37.997 --> 05:40.330
I found my dad's
<i>Playboy</i> collection.

05:42.384 --> 05:44.584
Threw my arm out.

05:46.672 --> 05:48.505
All right, the pitcher's mound
in Major League Baseball

05:48.507 --> 05:50.924
is 60 feet, six inches
away from home plate.

05:50.926 --> 05:53.093
Great. You take this

05:53.095 --> 05:55.262
and say when to stop

06:01.070 --> 06:02.402
How much further?

06:02.404 --> 06:04.404
Keep going.

06:06.108 --> 06:07.357
How about now?

06:07.359 --> 06:10.110
I'll let you know.

06:12.281 --> 06:15.449
Are you saying “stop” and we're
just too far away to hear you?

06:15.451 --> 06:17.534
Okay, stop.

06:21.390 --> 06:23.690
Are you kidding me?!

06:23.692 --> 06:25.142
That's 60 feet.

06:25.144 --> 06:27.778
There's no way
this is 60 feet.

06:27.780 --> 06:30.213
I'm looking at it.

06:31.216 --> 06:32.883
You realize this isn't
one of those times

06:32.885 --> 06:35.969
I want you to exaggerate
how long something is.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.310
Okay, I got to...
I-I just...

06:43.312 --> 06:45.395
I got to ask:

06:45.397 --> 06:47.364
what makes you think
that your relationship

06:47.366 --> 06:49.900
is so wonderful
and ours isn't?

06:49.902 --> 06:51.485
For starters,

06:51.487 --> 06:53.653
we enjoy spending time together.

06:57.626 --> 06:59.209
So do we.

06:59.211 --> 07:01.244
And I've seen you guys
ignore each other for hours

07:01.246 --> 07:03.130
doing totally
different things.

07:03.132 --> 07:06.633
It's called parallel play.

07:06.635 --> 07:08.335
Yeah, toddlers
do that.

07:08.337 --> 07:11.254
Not as well as we do.

07:12.508 --> 07:15.258
You believe this guy? He has to
be the best at everything.

07:15.260 --> 07:17.477
So what?
Why do you even care?

07:17.479 --> 07:19.096
Oh, listen to them.

07:19.098 --> 07:22.182
Not even married
and the honeymoon's over.

07:22.184 --> 07:24.734
Whatever. You can't
even go on a date

07:24.736 --> 07:26.903
without checking your
relationship agreement.

07:26.905 --> 07:30.574
If you've got a problem basing
a relationship on a contract,

07:30.576 --> 07:33.777
I'd like to tell you
about 13 plucky colonies

07:33.779 --> 07:35.912
that entered
a “relationship agreement”

07:35.914 --> 07:38.532
called the U.S. Constitution.

07:38.534 --> 07:40.867
And it may not be cool
to say so,

07:40.869 --> 07:43.787
but I think that love affair
is still pretty hot today.

07:46.091 --> 07:48.091
It's a good thing I'm not
wearing flag underwear

07:48.093 --> 07:51.461
right now, 'cause there's
about to be a fire.

07:57.102 --> 07:59.302
Okay, it's not
that hard.

07:59.304 --> 08:00.971
You just look to where
you want to throw it,

08:00.973 --> 08:02.272
step towards where
you want to throw,

08:02.274 --> 08:03.640
and throw it.

08:06.562 --> 08:07.811
That's your help?

08:07.813 --> 08:11.148
That's like saying,
“Here's how you fly a plane:

08:11.150 --> 08:12.566
“get in the airplane,

08:12.568 --> 08:16.153
know where you want
to go and fly it.”

08:17.489 --> 08:19.990
Just throw the ball. Let's see what
we're working with.

08:21.000 --> 08:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:30.252 --> 08:32.001
Come on Howard, fire it in.

08:57.029 --> 08:59.196
Throw the damn ball!

09:08.669 --> 09:10.953
So when do you guys
plan on getting married?

09:10.955 --> 09:13.255
Uh, we're not sure.
But I want to wait long enough

09:13.257 --> 09:15.507
to prove to my mother
I'm not pregnant.

09:17.345 --> 09:19.094
May I have
one of your fries?

09:19.096 --> 09:20.763
Of course.

09:20.765 --> 09:22.631
Can I have a bite
of your burger?

09:22.633 --> 09:24.633
Absolutely not.

09:24.635 --> 09:26.969
Some perfect couple.

09:26.971 --> 09:28.637
He won't even share
his food with her.

09:28.639 --> 09:30.439
It has avocado on it.

09:30.441 --> 09:32.641
She's allergic
to avocado.

09:32.643 --> 09:35.060
Are you so jealous
of our relationship

09:35.062 --> 09:37.730
you want Amy to die?

09:37.732 --> 09:40.032
I'm not jealous.

09:40.034 --> 09:42.318
I just think it's silly for
you to compare relationships

09:42.320 --> 09:44.870
like they're something
that can be quantified.

09:44.872 --> 09:46.705
Everything is quantifiable.

09:46.707 --> 09:49.575
That French fry? A seven.

09:49.577 --> 09:51.710
Spider-Man? A nine.

09:51.712 --> 09:55.047
The number nine--
oddly, only a four.

09:55.049 --> 09:56.999
How ridiculous is he?

09:57.001 --> 09:59.335
A hundred.

10:01.389 --> 10:03.555
Sheldon, you're just
assigning random numbers

10:03.557 --> 10:05.424
to things based on your opinion.

10:05.426 --> 10:06.809
No, I'm not.

10:06.811 --> 10:08.727
French fries have
three variables--

10:08.729 --> 10:10.729
crispiness, saltiness
and shape.

10:10.731 --> 10:12.097
Which is why a curly fry

10:12.099 --> 10:13.565
only gets a two.

10:13.567 --> 10:16.852
If I wanted curls for dinner,
I'd order a clown wig.

10:18.022 --> 10:21.740
Well, a relationship is more
complicated than a French fry.

10:21.742 --> 10:25.110
Not according to the work
of Berscheid, Snyder and Omoto.

10:25.112 --> 10:29.198
Oh, what did those
rascals do now?

10:29.200 --> 10:31.700
They developed the Relationship
Closeness Inventory,

10:31.702 --> 10:34.586
which predicts the stability
of a couple based on behavior.

10:34.588 --> 10:35.954
Yeah, not to be confused

10:35.956 --> 10:37.873
with the French Fry
Goodness Inventory.

10:37.875 --> 10:40.459
That's pure Cooper.

10:40.461 --> 10:42.261
So, this is accurate?

10:42.263 --> 10:44.046
It's been around for 25 years,

10:44.048 --> 10:45.714
and has been extensively
corroborated

10:45.716 --> 10:47.016
by other researchers.

10:47.018 --> 10:49.535
Well, kind of takes the romance
out of relationships.

10:49.537 --> 10:52.554
Kind of? It does it perfectly.

10:53.274 --> 10:54.606
Sheldon and I got

10:54.608 --> 10:56.058
an eight-point-two
out of ten.

10:56.060 --> 10:58.894
Fine. We'll take it
right now.

10:58.896 --> 11:00.229
No, don't.
What?

11:00.231 --> 11:01.363
Just don't take it.

11:01.365 --> 11:02.398
Why not?
'Cause it's stupid.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.066
Who cares what
number it is?

11:04.068 --> 11:06.402
Come on. It'll be fun.
I said I don't want you to.

11:06.404 --> 11:09.154
I'm getting
another drink.

11:10.991 --> 11:13.208
Sorry.

11:14.995 --> 11:17.946
I'm gonna let you
count this as two dates.

11:17.948 --> 11:20.115
They're a lot of work.

11:24.505 --> 11:26.939
Think he's getting
any better?

11:29.810 --> 11:32.010
Yup.

11:32.012 --> 11:34.279
That was a close one!

11:34.281 --> 11:36.899
Okay!

11:36.901 --> 11:39.101
Is it too late
for him to cancel?

11:39.103 --> 11:40.319
I think so.

11:44.475 --> 11:47.342
Heads up! Watch out!

11:54.502 --> 11:56.618
Are you mad at me?

11:56.620 --> 11:58.871
No, stop being stupid.

11:58.873 --> 12:02.207
Um... whew?

12:03.260 --> 12:05.878
Is this about the test,
or is this about us?

12:05.880 --> 12:07.796
Look, I don't need
a score on a test

12:07.798 --> 12:10.215
to make me worry about something
I'm already worried about.

12:10.217 --> 12:11.967
What are you worried about?

12:11.969 --> 12:14.970
That we're engaged and
have nothing in common,

12:14.972 --> 12:16.688
and it scares me.

12:16.690 --> 12:19.691
Yeah, that scares me, too.

12:19.693 --> 12:21.193
It does?

12:21.195 --> 12:22.694
Sometimes.

12:22.696 --> 12:25.364
Well, that's not good!

12:26.650 --> 12:29.151
You being blindly infatuated
with me was the rock

12:29.153 --> 12:32.237
we were building
this relationship on!

12:32.239 --> 12:35.824
Okay, well, this might
make you feel better.

12:35.826 --> 12:39.795
Uh, we're both scared that
our marriage will be a disaster,

12:39.797 --> 12:43.582
and so, that's something
that we have in common.

12:47.204 --> 12:50.055
Also, we both think
I'm not funny.

12:52.226 --> 12:55.010
Huh? See, you're not laughing.

12:59.450 --> 13:01.350
Hey, Froot Loops, what's up?

13:01.352 --> 13:03.869
Hey, Mike.

13:03.871 --> 13:06.038
Listen, NASA asked me to

13:06.040 --> 13:08.774
throw out the first pitch
at an Angels game.

13:08.776 --> 13:10.843
You got any advice?

13:10.845 --> 13:12.845
Yeah. Don't do it.

13:14.381 --> 13:15.948
What else you up to?

13:15.950 --> 13:18.183
Why shouldn't I do it?

13:18.185 --> 13:19.551
There's no upside.

13:19.553 --> 13:21.587
If you do well, no one cares.

13:21.589 --> 13:23.188
And if you screw up,

13:23.190 --> 13:26.124
you're an idiot
on YouTube forever.

13:27.161 --> 13:29.211
But it's for a good cause.

13:29.213 --> 13:31.513
What about all the kids
that'll be there?

13:31.515 --> 13:32.965
That's what I'm telling you.

13:32.967 --> 13:34.766
Kids are the worst.

13:36.287 --> 13:39.888
My own daughter tweeted
I have a giant nose.

13:41.275 --> 13:43.025
Well, maybe I'll do a good job.

13:43.027 --> 13:44.226
I don't know.

13:44.228 --> 13:46.728
In space,
you couldn't even toss me a pen,

13:46.730 --> 13:49.314
and that was in zero gravity.

13:50.651 --> 13:52.751
Okay, thanks for the pep talk.

13:52.753 --> 13:54.136
Anytime, Froot Loops.

13:55.072 --> 13:56.788
Give your wife a hug for me.

13:56.790 --> 13:59.908
She's so much cuter than you, I
don't know how you ever got her.

14:01.979 --> 14:04.162
He's so nice.

14:08.002 --> 14:10.219
Hey, sorry about that.

14:10.221 --> 14:11.837
No, we're sorry.

14:11.839 --> 14:13.755
We never should have been
comparing relationships

14:13.757 --> 14:15.173
in the first place.

14:15.175 --> 14:17.476
Why? We won.

14:18.646 --> 14:20.762
You know, I say, next, we take
on Koothrappali and his dog.

14:20.764 --> 14:23.932
Really give
ourselves a challenge.

14:23.934 --> 14:26.184
I just want to say
one more thing about this.

14:26.186 --> 14:28.270
Just because Penny
and I are very different people

14:28.272 --> 14:30.105
does not mean
that we're a bad couple.

14:30.107 --> 14:33.108
The answer is
one simple test away.

14:33.110 --> 14:34.409
Hmm? You know,
it's like

14:34.411 --> 14:36.778
when I thought there was
a possum in my closet.

14:36.780 --> 14:38.947
Did I sit around
wondering?

14:38.949 --> 14:42.784
No, I sent Leonard in with
a pointy stick and a bag.

14:42.786 --> 14:46.672
I killed
his Chewbacca slippers.

14:48.959 --> 14:50.175
Let's just
take the test.

14:50.177 --> 14:51.627
No, no, no,
I don't want to.

14:51.629 --> 14:53.345
Oh, well, 'cause you
know we're gonna do bad.

14:53.347 --> 14:54.680
Because it doesn't matter.

14:54.682 --> 14:57.466
I don't care
if we're a ten or a two.

14:57.468 --> 15:00.769
Or a one.
A one is possible.

15:00.771 --> 15:03.388
Marriage is scary.

15:03.390 --> 15:04.806
You're scared, I'm scared.

15:04.808 --> 15:07.476
But it doesn't make me
not want to do it.

15:07.478 --> 15:09.528
It-it just...

15:09.530 --> 15:12.898
makes me want to hold your hand
and do it with you.

15:14.335 --> 15:16.318
Leonard...

15:18.072 --> 15:21.490
It would make me so happy
if you said things like that.

15:21.492 --> 15:23.325
We got an
eight-point-two.

15:23.327 --> 15:25.494
Trust me, you're happy.

15:34.421 --> 15:37.806
Mm! I love how they put
a waterfall at center field.

15:37.808 --> 15:40.676
It really ties
the whole stadium together.

15:40.678 --> 15:42.978
Look at you, talking sports.

15:44.815 --> 15:46.098
This is fun, huh?

15:46.100 --> 15:48.350
We get to see our friend
throw out the first pitch,

15:48.352 --> 15:49.901
have a hot dog,
watch the game.

15:49.903 --> 15:51.770
Whoa.

15:51.772 --> 15:54.072
Nobody said anything
about watching the game.

15:55.159 --> 15:57.442
Sheldon, what
did you expect?

15:57.444 --> 16:01.697
I expected to see Howard throw
the baseball, finish my hot dog,

16:01.699 --> 16:04.082
and hightail it across
the street to Disneyland

16:04.084 --> 16:07.536
just in time for Mickey's
Soundsational Parade.

16:07.538 --> 16:09.121
I'll tell you what.

16:09.123 --> 16:13.291
If we stay, I'll buy you
cotton candy and a bobblehead.

16:13.293 --> 16:15.043
Who's the bobblehead of?

16:15.045 --> 16:16.678
Does it matter?

16:16.680 --> 16:19.548
No, as long as it bobbles.

16:20.884 --> 16:23.051
Howie, I am so proud of you.

16:23.053 --> 16:26.054
Thanks.
I'm proud of me, too.

16:26.056 --> 16:27.305
Mm-hmm.

16:27.307 --> 16:28.974
You ready?

16:28.976 --> 16:30.225
Let's do it.

16:30.227 --> 16:31.443
All right.

16:32.896 --> 16:34.946
Wish me luck.

16:34.948 --> 16:36.365
Go get 'em.

16:36.367 --> 16:37.783
Ladies and gentlemen,

16:37.785 --> 16:40.535
in honor of Space Day at
Angel Stadium, the first pitch

16:40.537 --> 16:45.240
will be thrown out by NASA
astronaut Howard Wolowitz.

16:48.162 --> 16:49.411
Thank you.

16:49.413 --> 16:51.329
Thank you.

16:51.331 --> 16:52.914
Can he really
throw a ball?

16:52.916 --> 16:57.085
On our Quidditch team, he...
Yeah, that's a “no.”

16:57.087 --> 17:01.890
I have a message
for the young people here today.

17:01.892 --> 17:04.675
When I was asked
to throw the first pitch,

17:04.678 --> 17:09.848
a little voice in my head said
I couldn't do it.

17:09.849 --> 17:13.101
So, I practiced and practiced,

17:13.103 --> 17:15.186
and you know what?

17:15.189 --> 17:17.606
That little voice...

17:17.608 --> 17:20.157
...was right, but...

17:21.662 --> 17:25.430
...then I remembered
that I'm not an athlete.

17:25.432 --> 17:27.715
I'm a scientist.

17:27.718 --> 17:29.117
So, today's

17:29.119 --> 17:31.453
first pitch will be delivered

17:31.455 --> 17:34.372
to home plate by science.

17:34.374 --> 17:35.874
Ladies and gentlemen,

17:35.876 --> 17:38.293
boys and girls, I present to you

17:38.295 --> 17:44.049
a working prototype
of the Mars Rover!

17:48.605 --> 17:51.223
And here's the wind-up...

17:51.225 --> 17:53.058
and the pitch!

18:04.655 --> 18:06.988
Why is it going so slow?!

18:06.990 --> 18:10.075
'Cause I'm an idiot
who didn't think this through!

18:10.994 --> 18:12.544
Okay, new plan.

18:12.546 --> 18:14.162
We go to Disneyland,

18:14.164 --> 18:16.581
play hide and seek
on Tom Sawyer's Island,

18:16.583 --> 18:20.001
and then come back
and see the end of the pitch.

18:29.346 --> 18:32.147
Okay, while we're waiting
for the ball to arrive,

18:32.149 --> 18:34.149
here's some fun facts
about Mars.

18:34.151 --> 18:37.519
You suck, Wolowitz!

18:38.739 --> 18:41.273
He makes a valid point!

19:01.162 --> 19:03.812
Okay, booing isn't gonna make it
go any faster!
