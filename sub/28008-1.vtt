03:45.172 --> 03:47.005
When did Amaia's parents die?

03:47.630 --> 03:48.963
Two years ago.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.547
This was Amaia's bedroom.

04:37.505 --> 04:39.047
This place is alive!

04:42.297 --> 04:43.880
I can't wait to start!

05:24.213 --> 05:25.213
I'm ready.

05:25.297 --> 05:27.047
Remember what we agreed.
No politics.

05:27.630 --> 05:30.255
Yes, no political ideologies.

05:31.088 --> 05:32.963
I'll start. Brace yourself.

05:33.380 --> 05:35.547
Summer 1991.

05:35.755 --> 05:37.255
Nuria Bellmunt, my mother,

05:38.172 --> 05:40.963
was at her family's house
in Lloret de Mar,

05:41.130 --> 05:42.880
<i>on the Costa Brava,</i>

05:45.005 --> 05:48.005
<i>when her parents, my grandparents,</i>

05:48.338 --> 05:49.963
<i>were run over and killed.</i>

05:50.797 --> 05:53.172
<i>My mother was told
it was an accident.</i>

06:00.963 --> 06:02.672
<i>She was left all alone,</i>

06:03.505 --> 06:04.963
<i>with the house,</i>

06:05.338 --> 06:07.338
<i>and a whole summer ahead of her.</i>

06:11.255 --> 06:14.088
<i>Friends and relatives
tried to comfort her,</i>

06:14.797 --> 06:17.338
<i>but she went and fell for a Russian.</i>

06:28.672 --> 06:32.005
<i>Dimitri wasn't Russian,
he was a fucking Georgian.</i>

06:32.755 --> 06:35.047
<i>The first time,
she gave him what he wanted,</i>

06:35.213 --> 06:36.797
<i>to get him off her.</i>

06:40.088 --> 06:43.088
<i>But the second,
she was confused and terrified.</i>

06:44.130 --> 06:45.130
<i>She paid double.</i>

06:49.838 --> 06:52.088
<i>The third time,
she was incredibly lucky.</i>

06:53.130 --> 06:56.755
<i>One morning, her father's
driver and bodyguard appeared,</i>

06:57.463 --> 06:58.672
<i>Olmo Mendoza.</i>

06:58.880 --> 07:01.172
I saw your parents get run over.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.755
I was waiting in the car for them.

07:05.047 --> 07:06.797
It was the Georgian mafia.

07:07.505 --> 07:08.880
Pack your things, right now.

07:09.005 --> 07:10.588
Grab everything you can.

07:18.255 --> 07:19.380
Where are you taking me?

07:20.005 --> 07:23.088
Don't come back to the Costa Brava
for at least ten years.

07:23.547 --> 07:24.880
What about my house?

07:25.213 --> 07:27.838
It'll be the HQ
of a Georgian mafia boss.

07:28.130 --> 07:29.422
I'll call the police.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.672
If you do, they'll kill you.

07:41.547 --> 07:42.547
What are you doing?

07:44.255 --> 07:45.755
I want a swim.

09:33.297 --> 09:36.880
<i>She was all alone,
with her parents' car.</i>

09:37.797 --> 09:39.255
<i>She didn't know how to drive.</i>

09:39.380 --> 09:42.338
"She didn't know how to drive."

09:45.713 --> 09:48.547
And your mother?
Where was she then?

09:51.547 --> 09:53.713
My mother was La Maca.

09:54.005 --> 09:57.047
She was at the height
of her musical success.

09:59.172 --> 10:03.797
<i>You offer me a trip
through my loins.</i>

10:04.838 --> 10:05.963
<i>Licking.</i>

10:06.922 --> 10:10.838
<i>While I go to heaven,
you keep exploring me.</i>

10:14.588 --> 10:17.422
<i>The sex of the world,
my sex.</i>

10:26.672 --> 10:28.672
<i>I was conceived
during her last album.</i>

10:28.880 --> 10:31.005
<i>The sex of the world,
my sex.</i>

10:32.547 --> 10:35.088
<i>My biological father
was a faceless stranger.</i>

10:35.255 --> 10:37.797
<i>My mother remembers fucking him,
but nothing else.</i>

10:39.755 --> 10:42.547
<i>She was out of it on drugs
at the time.</i>

10:43.172 --> 10:45.463
<i>I almost died at birth.</i>

10:45.630 --> 10:48.463
<i>They had to cut my chest open twice.</i>

10:50.130 --> 10:51.963
Now for my favourite character.

10:58.963 --> 11:00.005
Hello.

11:01.630 --> 11:03.088
Are you La Maca?

11:04.672 --> 11:06.672
I'm a fan of your music.

11:08.380 --> 11:09.880
Well, of you actually.

11:10.005 --> 11:11.338
A big fan.

11:15.797 --> 11:19.963
<i>My mother saw in one look
that she needed this man.</i>

11:33.255 --> 11:36.672
<i>Víctor Mendoza
was a godsend in our lives.</i>

11:40.255 --> 11:44.255
Enter my grandparents:
Pío Santolaya and Candela López.

11:44.422 --> 11:46.297
<i>In their country house in Seville.</i>

11:46.547 --> 11:48.547
<i>They accepted Víctor right away.</i>

11:48.880 --> 11:52.255
<i>To my grandmother,
he was an angel sent by God.</i>

11:52.422 --> 11:55.338
<i>My grandfather treated him
like the son he never had.</i>

12:24.297 --> 12:25.547
Let's go.

13:14.338 --> 13:15.547
What is it?

13:16.005 --> 13:17.213
Nothing.

13:19.005 --> 13:22.505
It was as if her baby
suddenly frightened her.

13:43.963 --> 13:47.338
Shut up! Shut up!

13:47.505 --> 13:48.672
Shut up!

13:49.172 --> 13:51.922
No! Shut up!

13:54.005 --> 13:55.297
Maca! Maca!

13:55.547 --> 13:56.797
Maca!

13:58.463 --> 13:59.463
It's OK.

13:59.547 --> 14:02.172
Those voices are driving me crazy.

14:02.797 --> 14:05.630
Those voices are driving me crazy!

14:06.338 --> 14:08.672
They're driving me crazy!

14:13.505 --> 14:14.922
ENTRANCE

14:15.172 --> 14:17.922
<i>My mother asked them to commit her.</i>

14:27.297 --> 14:29.213
You'll be fine, OK?

14:29.797 --> 14:31.088
You'll be fine.

14:47.172 --> 14:50.047
<i>Víctor was left with me,
like a single dad.</i>

14:52.422 --> 14:54.297
<i>My grandfather paid him
an allowance,</i>

14:55.005 --> 14:57.630
<i>gave him a job in the company
selling houses,</i>

14:59.963 --> 15:01.672
<i>and even gave him one of them.</i>

15:04.922 --> 15:06.797
Let's talk about
the children from Russia.

15:07.172 --> 15:08.255
That's your subject.

15:16.922 --> 15:21.547
<i>With the intense bombing
of Bilbao since January 1937,</i>

15:21.713 --> 15:25.463
<i>the Basque Government has evacuated
20,000 children by sea to Europe.</i>

15:25.922 --> 15:29.630
<i>In June, just days before the fall
of Bilbao into rebel hands,</i>

15:29.797 --> 15:32.797
<i>1,500 children
were sent to Russia.</i>

15:33.005 --> 15:35.880
<i>So many children will be raised
as orphans in exile!</i>

15:36.005 --> 15:39.755
<i>So many parents will mourn
sending their children so far away!</i>

15:43.130 --> 15:46.172
That's Jacinto Mendoza.
The girl is Julieta de Paula.

15:46.255 --> 15:47.713
Jacinto fell in love with Julieta

15:47.797 --> 15:49.477
the first time
he heard her play the piano.

16:08.005 --> 16:11.380
This is her as a teenager
playing a piece she wrote aged 12.

16:13.005 --> 16:16.672
They were recruited
by the KGB as children.

16:17.047 --> 16:18.963
Both of them, as a couple.

16:19.088 --> 16:20.797
Their sons, Víctor and Olmo,

16:21.588 --> 16:24.213
also received tough military training.

16:24.672 --> 16:25.672
And they liked it.

16:25.797 --> 16:29.088
Víctor says it was a very happy time
for the Mendozas.

16:29.838 --> 16:33.672
After the Berlin Wall came down,
Russia didn't need spies in Spain,

16:34.213 --> 16:37.547
so Víctor and Olmo came to work
in Lloret, my mother's town.

16:37.963 --> 16:39.380
What about Jacinto and Julieta?

16:39.547 --> 16:41.380
They moved two years later

16:41.963 --> 16:43.672
to the coast, near Alicante.

16:43.922 --> 16:46.630
<i>They bought a villa
on the seafront in Denia,</i>

16:46.880 --> 16:48.547
<i>Julieta's hometown.</i>

17:00.963 --> 17:06.838
<i>Even whispers
aren't heard in the garden.</i>

17:07.463 --> 17:12.547
<i>Everything has died down
till morning.</i>

17:12.963 --> 17:16.380
<i>If you only knew</i>

17:17.255 --> 17:20.422
<i>how dear to me</i>

17:21.172 --> 17:26.422
<i>are these Moscow nights.</i>

17:28.422 --> 17:30.672
We know little about Olmo
at that time.

17:30.797 --> 17:32.755
He stopped being a driver
and bodyguard.

17:33.130 --> 17:34.130
What else?

17:34.922 --> 17:36.422
He was working as a gigolo.

17:36.505 --> 17:39.297
For chicks with money.
And he was worth it.

17:39.547 --> 17:43.505
Olmo could make himself
irresistible to any woman.

17:43.880 --> 17:47.672
He had 300 mg of testosterone
per cubic centimetre of blood.

17:47.838 --> 17:49.297
Twice the average amount.

17:49.922 --> 17:52.630
- According to a blood test.
- Really?

17:52.838 --> 17:53.838
Yes.

17:54.255 --> 17:57.005
And how much do you have?

18:03.797 --> 18:04.922
What do you reckon?

18:13.172 --> 18:14.297
Marc.

18:15.047 --> 18:16.588
We've only just started.

18:21.797 --> 18:23.963
I'M NOT DEAD
AMAIA ZUGAZA

18:24.047 --> 18:27.172
I remember my mum
reading the manuscript.

18:27.547 --> 18:28.755
<i>Is this where you come in?</i>

18:29.130 --> 18:30.130
Yes.

18:31.463 --> 18:35.547
<i>I, Marc Bellmunt, could tell
when she liked a manuscript.</i>

18:36.463 --> 18:39.255
<i>It was by a young Basque writer,
Amaia Zugaza.</i>

18:39.338 --> 18:40.755
<i>There was Amaia already.</i>

18:41.130 --> 18:42.963
<i>Knocking at your mum's door.</i>

18:43.130 --> 18:44.297
She wrote it here,

18:44.463 --> 18:47.255
at that very desk.
Her first novel.

18:47.672 --> 18:48.672
It won loads of prizes.

18:48.963 --> 18:50.255
Too many.

18:51.213 --> 18:52.297
It was overrated.

18:54.547 --> 18:56.797
My mum fell in love like a teenager.

19:14.047 --> 19:16.838
<i>It only happened that one time.</i>

19:17.005 --> 19:18.755
<i>I only found out much later.</i>

19:23.380 --> 19:24.838
<i>Your mum loves doing it in water.</i>

19:30.588 --> 19:31.588
So do I.

19:31.922 --> 19:32.922
I know.

19:36.547 --> 19:38.088
Víctor is waiting for us.

19:39.130 --> 19:41.172
Víctor couldn't get my mum to see me,

19:41.588 --> 19:44.463
or even to leave the hospital
to spend time with us.

19:45.505 --> 19:47.005
The poor woman was unhinged.

19:47.380 --> 19:51.047
It was a mixture of panic and shame.

19:51.463 --> 19:53.005
And guilt, no?

19:53.588 --> 19:55.172
For rejecting her daughter.

19:55.713 --> 19:57.963
Víctor said she rejected herself
as a mother.

19:59.172 --> 20:03.172
Then, one evening,
Víctor had a wonderful idea.

20:03.505 --> 20:04.630
This is where you come in.

20:05.755 --> 20:07.047
I already appeared as a baby.

20:07.130 --> 20:10.713
<i>But yes, here I was six.</i>

20:10.880 --> 20:12.422
<i>I remember it well.</i>

20:12.797 --> 20:15.130
Rebeca,
what is your mum most afraid of?

20:17.755 --> 20:18.755
Of me?

20:18.797 --> 20:19.838
No!

20:20.213 --> 20:22.213
Of the voices, right?

20:24.213 --> 20:27.672
How about you reach your mum
through your voice?

20:28.588 --> 20:32.047
When she realises it's your voice
and only yours,

20:32.630 --> 20:34.130
she'll keep listening.

20:34.838 --> 20:35.922
What should I say?

20:36.755 --> 20:40.130
Ask her to sing you to sleep.

20:54.880 --> 20:55.880
Hello, Víctor.

20:56.463 --> 20:57.797
Mum, it's Rebeca.

21:02.630 --> 21:03.630
Rebeca.

21:03.755 --> 21:06.963
<i>- Is that your voice?</i>
- Yes, and that's yours.

21:08.338 --> 21:10.963
- You have a beautiful voice.
- So do you, Mummy.

21:12.130 --> 21:12.880
Thank you.

21:13.130 --> 21:15.505
- That's why I called.
- Oh, really?

21:15.672 --> 21:16.880
Will you sing to me?

21:17.755 --> 21:20.005
<i>Then I'll fall asleep
to your song.</i>

21:26.880 --> 21:31.505
<i>Your hands fall asleep.</i>

21:32.672 --> 21:37.255
<i>Your eyes,
which can still hear me,</i>

21:37.963 --> 21:42.338
<i>close themselves to the world.</i>

21:43.130 --> 21:44.963
<i>Rebeca,</i>

21:46.338 --> 21:47.963
<i>Rebeca...</i>

21:48.088 --> 21:51.672
<i>So that's what we did
for several nights,</i>

21:52.547 --> 21:57.255
<i>and Víctor also enjoyed
my mum's voice.</i>

21:59.380 --> 22:01.005
<i>Good night, my child.</i>

22:01.088 --> 22:02.088
She's fallen asleep.

22:06.672 --> 22:09.047
VÍCTOR HUNG UP.

22:13.547 --> 22:14.838
Víctor.

22:18.338 --> 22:20.213
Víctor is so great!

22:25.213 --> 22:26.547
Are we OK?

22:26.713 --> 22:27.713
Yes.

22:31.213 --> 22:33.713
Olmo is about to arrive.
Right here.

22:34.213 --> 22:37.213
At this old Basque farmhouse
of all places.

22:41.922 --> 22:43.255
At that moment in time,

22:43.422 --> 22:45.797
Olmo was looking
to change his life completely.

22:46.047 --> 22:48.005
<i>Amaia happened to be in Madrid.</i>

22:48.338 --> 22:50.130
<i>She had just received an award.</i>

22:52.880 --> 22:55.505
<i>The following day
she would return here, to the farm.</i>

23:31.130 --> 23:33.338
<i>Amaia had five orgasms in a row.</i>

23:35.380 --> 23:40.338
Nobody had ever given her
so much pleasure.

23:51.130 --> 23:52.505
"Five orgasms in a row"?

23:53.172 --> 23:55.213
"Nobody had ever given her
so much pleasure"?

23:55.297 --> 23:56.630
How do you know?

23:56.797 --> 23:58.338
It makes it sexier.

23:59.838 --> 24:00.838
All right. Your turn.

24:04.172 --> 24:05.922
Thanks for driving me home.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.422
I'm going away too.

24:09.963 --> 24:11.922
I have my luggage in the boot.

24:12.547 --> 24:13.797
Where are you going?

24:14.838 --> 24:15.838
I don't know.

24:17.130 --> 24:18.672
To some mountain.

25:04.255 --> 25:06.463
The cows... Are they yours?

25:06.672 --> 25:07.672
No.

25:08.047 --> 25:11.255
My parents are old now,
they sold theirs years ago.

25:11.963 --> 25:13.047
Do you like cows?

25:15.130 --> 25:16.130
I'm a bull.

25:19.380 --> 25:21.213
Well, this valley is full of cows.

25:29.755 --> 25:31.088
Do you recognise him?

25:32.922 --> 25:33.963
No.

26:04.797 --> 26:06.338
I could live here.

26:10.588 --> 26:12.963
I'll figure out a reason for you to stay.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.963
Couldn't they do that
somewhere else?

26:23.005 --> 26:24.297
Let them kiss.

26:25.880 --> 26:29.255
Meanwhile, Víctor made great strides.

26:32.005 --> 26:34.047
ENTRANCE

26:41.963 --> 26:44.088
Macarena is waiting in the garden.

26:44.838 --> 26:46.130
Thank you.

27:18.338 --> 27:22.088
Your mother is going to be
like a magic tree,

27:22.380 --> 27:24.588
she's going to
step out of the soil,

27:25.172 --> 27:26.713
go to her room,

27:27.547 --> 27:31.380
shower and put on the dress
I brought her yesterday,

27:31.588 --> 27:33.547
which looks amazing on her,

27:33.963 --> 27:37.547
then she's going to stand
right there,

27:38.547 --> 27:40.172
so you'll be face to face,

27:40.755 --> 27:42.255
<i>mother and daughter.</i>

28:05.380 --> 28:07.380
- Are you nervous?
- Of course.

28:12.005 --> 28:15.547
Víctor, you're even better
than a real father.

28:16.213 --> 28:17.505
Víctor.

28:17.922 --> 28:20.463
You're even better
than a real father.

28:20.672 --> 28:22.047
I'm going to call you "Dad".

28:22.963 --> 28:24.463
Thank you, "Daughter".

28:29.755 --> 28:30.755
Hello.

28:31.713 --> 28:32.713
Mum!

28:35.880 --> 28:38.255
Víctor wants me to come back home.

28:38.422 --> 28:39.422
So do I!

28:46.088 --> 28:48.505
I hope my voices won't bother you.

28:48.797 --> 28:50.047
Of course not.

28:50.838 --> 28:52.630
Then yours won't bother me either.

29:18.922 --> 29:21.380
Mum, what are the voices like?

29:24.422 --> 29:25.797
Not voices.

29:27.213 --> 29:28.672
It's just one.

29:30.213 --> 29:32.630
And what does it sound like?

29:33.588 --> 29:34.588
Like a boy.

29:35.088 --> 29:36.338
It's a boy.

29:37.380 --> 29:41.005
Sometimes he uses different voices,
but I know it's him.

29:42.172 --> 29:43.255
And what does he say?

29:43.797 --> 29:47.672
That I'm not his mother.
He's always held it against me.

29:48.172 --> 29:51.422
Tell him he's right,
you only have one kid, and it's me.

29:52.380 --> 29:53.838
Tell him to piss off.

29:55.505 --> 29:59.838
No, then he'll appear in my dreams
and scream in my ear.

30:01.047 --> 30:02.130
Can you hear him now?

30:07.588 --> 30:12.463
He says if I think gardening
is going to distract him,

30:13.088 --> 30:14.838
then I'm a fool.

30:21.213 --> 30:24.088
Víctor and Olmo both decided
to marry and have a family.

30:24.713 --> 30:27.005
Two families. One each.

30:28.755 --> 30:30.797
Olmo and Amaia were married
in this meadow,

30:31.005 --> 30:32.172
surrounded by cows,

30:34.297 --> 30:36.963
and Víctor and your mother
were surrounded by bulls.

30:37.130 --> 30:38.463
From my grandparents' ranch.

30:43.630 --> 30:45.797
The weddings were several years apart.

30:45.963 --> 30:47.005
Six years.

30:47.297 --> 30:48.797
But we don't mind that.

30:49.255 --> 30:50.672
I love that detail.

30:51.213 --> 30:55.672
I was eight at Víctor's wedding
and 14 at Olmo's.

30:55.838 --> 30:57.047
Just like me.

30:57.422 --> 30:58.922
That's where we met.

30:59.755 --> 31:00.963
At the cow wedding.

31:04.088 --> 31:07.297
<i>As a little girl, I sped south
in the groom's car.</i>

31:08.255 --> 31:10.713
<i>As a teenager,
the same car, going north.</i>

31:10.880 --> 31:14.088
<i>This time, with the groom's brother
and my mum.</i>

31:20.338 --> 31:23.047
<i>I was also going north,
with my mum.</i>

31:23.213 --> 31:27.588
<i>She didn't realise yet who the groom
at that wedding actually was.</i>

31:28.755 --> 31:30.755
<i>That's where we first met.</i>

31:36.963 --> 31:40.338
<i>We don't know when Julieta
disconnected from reality.</i>

31:40.547 --> 31:43.005
<i>She lived her life
plunged in a deep stupor.</i>

31:44.838 --> 31:45.838
<i>What's that?</i>

31:45.922 --> 31:47.672
<i>We'll get to that.</i>

31:48.672 --> 31:51.755
<i>The Mendozas only attended
their son Olmo's wedding.</i>

31:52.255 --> 31:55.838
At Victor's wedding,
my grandparents were still proud

31:55.963 --> 31:57.922
that their side
had won the Civil War.

31:59.047 --> 32:00.297
Rebeca.

32:02.255 --> 32:03.630
No politics.

32:04.380 --> 32:05.630
<i>Dearly beloved,</i>

32:05.797 --> 32:08.838
today we join
Macarena Santolaya

32:08.963 --> 32:10.672
and Víctor Mendoza

32:10.838 --> 32:13.963
as they are joined in holy matrimony.

32:14.672 --> 32:15.672
Welcome.

32:15.838 --> 32:19.838
Amaia Zugaza and Olmo Mendoza
are here to be married

32:19.963 --> 32:23.505
to love and support each other

32:23.672 --> 32:26.838
and live together under the law.

32:26.963 --> 32:30.255
<i>My parents had Father Jesús,
my grandfather's brother.</i>

32:31.297 --> 32:34.797
I now declare you husband and wife.

32:45.630 --> 32:46.880
My beautiful girl.

32:48.380 --> 32:49.505
Dad.

32:50.005 --> 32:51.297
Mum.

32:56.797 --> 32:57.797
Son-in-law.

33:13.630 --> 33:17.630
Such a pity your brother
and your sister can't be here.

33:18.463 --> 33:19.463
A pity?

33:20.047 --> 33:21.755
I wouldn't have invited them.

33:27.588 --> 33:30.130
A kiss! A kiss!

33:30.255 --> 33:33.255
- To the bride and groom!
- Cheers!

33:33.422 --> 33:35.047
A kiss! A kiss!

33:35.172 --> 33:38.963
Kiss! Kiss!

33:39.088 --> 33:41.505
Kiss! Kiss!

34:10.755 --> 34:12.880
<i>That was the first time
I wanted to kiss you.</i>

34:13.338 --> 34:15.213
<i>I hadn't noticed you yet.</i>

34:42.672 --> 34:46.963
<i>My dear daughter, stand up,</i>

34:47.130 --> 34:51.172
<i>and gaze upon the summit</i>

34:51.338 --> 34:55.422
<i>home of your protector,</i>

34:55.588 --> 35:00.297
<i>Mary, Lady of Anboto Mountain.</i>

35:01.005 --> 35:05.422
<i>Dear Amaia, stand up</i>

35:05.588 --> 35:09.297
<i>and walk freely</i>

35:09.505 --> 35:13.922
<i>on your own mountain,</i>

35:14.338 --> 35:20.588
<i>steadfastly on your path.</i>

35:25.922 --> 35:28.088
- Dad.
- Thank you!

35:56.213 --> 35:57.838
Rebeca.

36:00.088 --> 36:02.297
I love you more than anything.

36:17.922 --> 36:20.755
VÍCTOR MENDOZA
SALES MANAGER

36:42.255 --> 36:45.088
- Father.
- Thank you.

36:46.755 --> 36:50.463
And you, Víctor,
where were you baptised?

36:50.630 --> 36:53.797
Me? Nowhere, Father.
I'm not baptised.

37:05.088 --> 37:06.630
Excuse me.

37:10.047 --> 37:11.838
He didn't try the cake.

37:12.588 --> 37:14.172
Let's not overreact.

37:14.338 --> 37:17.838
I think you assumed
there was nothing wrong about it.

37:17.963 --> 37:18.963
Let it go.

37:19.088 --> 37:22.255
My brother left so he can pretend
he didn't hear it.

37:22.963 --> 37:25.505
Or else he'd have to annul
the marriage.

37:25.963 --> 37:27.755
Am I baptised?

37:28.338 --> 37:31.005
- Yes, darling. You are.
- Really?

37:31.255 --> 37:34.005
When was she baptised?
I don't remember.

37:34.172 --> 37:37.713
In the hospital.
You were really low.

37:38.838 --> 37:41.588
We baptised you
before the second operation.

37:41.755 --> 37:43.755
We thought you were going to die.

37:43.922 --> 37:46.547
It was so you would go
straight to heaven.

38:56.672 --> 38:58.963
Look, my mum and yours.

39:02.797 --> 39:04.172
They have a connection.

39:04.463 --> 39:09.213
Dad, how come you've never
mentioned your parents to me?

39:11.047 --> 39:13.838
- You've never even introduced me.
- Haven't I?

39:13.963 --> 39:14.963
Don't worry.

39:15.130 --> 39:16.922
I'll introduce myself.

39:22.630 --> 39:24.172
Hello, grandfather.

39:25.588 --> 39:27.672
I'm sorry, I'm not your grandfather.

39:28.963 --> 39:32.713
Well, your son, Víctor,
is like a father to me.

39:36.672 --> 39:37.672
Julieta.

39:37.838 --> 39:39.797
This is your granddaughter, Rebeca.

39:39.963 --> 39:41.797
And I'm your daughter-in-law,
Macarena.

39:45.005 --> 39:48.047
- What's happening?
- She wants to tell us something.

39:51.588 --> 39:52.880
Do you want to touch them?

39:56.922 --> 39:58.755
Play any tune you like.

40:16.713 --> 40:19.547
Poor woman.
She's suffered so much.

40:30.588 --> 40:31.838
My son...

40:34.338 --> 40:39.088
Looking after you is the best thing
my son has done in his life.

40:55.213 --> 40:58.172
Olmo, this is Nuria, my editor.

40:59.838 --> 41:01.922
Hello.
Amaia has told me a lot about you.

41:02.047 --> 41:05.255
<i>My mother recognised Olmo,
but she didn't tell Amaia.</i>

41:05.422 --> 41:06.755
Nuria Bellmunt.

41:06.922 --> 41:08.963
<i>When Olmo heard the name Bellmunt,</i>

41:09.088 --> 41:11.588
<i>he realised he had known her
years earlier.</i>

41:11.755 --> 41:14.297
- May I borrow her?
- Of course.

41:14.463 --> 41:17.422
<i>Olmo remembered Amaia telling him
that one time, just once,</i>

41:17.630 --> 41:19.963
<i>she went swimming with her editor.</i>

41:21.088 --> 41:24.838
<i>My mother had been in the sea
with the bride, and with the groom.</i>

42:26.922 --> 42:28.672
What happened next?

42:30.255 --> 42:31.547
It was very strange.

42:32.963 --> 42:36.255
<i>Two storms.
One at each wedding.</i>

42:40.297 --> 42:42.505
But how did they start?

42:43.422 --> 42:44.797
The sky rumbled

42:49.963 --> 42:53.213
<i>and great black clouds appeared,</i>

42:53.422 --> 42:55.172
carried by a hot wind.

42:59.213 --> 43:01.088
<i>My mother had a terrible feeling.</i>

43:19.088 --> 43:22.297
And remarkably,
one of the cows went missing.

43:23.088 --> 43:24.172
The biggest one.

43:24.338 --> 43:25.963
<i>That's what Olmo said.</i>

43:55.422 --> 43:56.922
What happened?

43:57.297 --> 44:01.297
A powerful force arrived from...
I don't know where.

44:10.047 --> 44:11.880
You wrote me a letter.

44:12.088 --> 44:14.547
- I know. Don't remind me.
- I have it here.

44:15.088 --> 44:17.338
- Don't you dare read it.
- Hey.

44:17.672 --> 44:22.088
Not many people can boast about
receiving a genuine love letter.

44:22.963 --> 44:24.463
It's beautiful.

44:24.922 --> 44:26.672
It says a lot.

44:26.922 --> 44:28.672
More than you think.

44:29.047 --> 44:31.297
This boy has a beautiful voice.

44:34.380 --> 44:36.213
How are you going to respond?

44:43.922 --> 44:46.338
Is no hope at all really necessary?

44:47.713 --> 44:49.172
It's what I feel.

44:49.755 --> 44:52.963
Maybe you shouldn't send it.
Just in case.

44:55.547 --> 44:57.713
You want to give him hope?

45:01.255 --> 45:04.797
Don't send it.
She didn't answer the first one.

45:05.047 --> 45:07.047
This makes you sound desperate.

45:10.255 --> 45:11.880
<i>I resigned myself to it.</i>

45:12.463 --> 45:14.380
Being desperate for you.

45:14.588 --> 45:16.338
And I was focused on my mum.

45:16.547 --> 45:17.838
<i>The wind blows...</i>

45:17.963 --> 45:19.422
<i>Who was feeling much better.</i>

45:19.588 --> 45:22.463
<i>...tangling up my insides.</i>

45:22.672 --> 45:25.922
<i>I've got branches for ribs,</i>

45:26.047 --> 45:29.047
<i>and spiders in my throat.</i>

45:29.213 --> 45:31.505
<i>I convinced my dad
to lower her medication.</i>

45:32.047 --> 45:34.838
<i>I wanted more mum and I got it.</i>

45:38.255 --> 45:39.797
How long did that go on for?

45:39.963 --> 45:41.630
Each doing our own thing?

45:41.838 --> 45:44.505
The time it took Amaia
to write her second novel.

45:44.755 --> 45:47.047
Nine months, like a pregnancy.

45:50.047 --> 45:52.005
Amaia wanted a child with Olmo.

45:53.588 --> 45:55.255
And he agreed to it.

45:55.838 --> 45:57.922
But all that came out of her
was a novel.

47:03.463 --> 47:04.755
Are you hungry?

47:05.797 --> 47:07.505
Let's go to the kitchen.

47:12.005 --> 47:15.338
There were photos of Amaia's siblings
on that wall.

47:16.338 --> 47:19.213
Amaia sat there
with her back to them.

47:20.338 --> 47:21.463
I don't blame her.

47:22.422 --> 47:24.422
She didn't want to look at them.

47:26.505 --> 47:30.880
The brother was a fugitive in Mexico
and the sister was in prison.

47:31.047 --> 47:33.463
They killed nine people
between them.

47:33.672 --> 47:38.130
The ones Amaia brought back to life
in her first novel,<i> I'm Not Dead.</i>

47:38.630 --> 47:40.547
That novel spooked me out.

47:42.130 --> 47:43.755
I found it fascinating.

47:44.672 --> 47:46.005
It created waves around here.

47:46.338 --> 47:47.797
No politics.

48:06.963 --> 48:08.713
What did her parents think?

48:08.880 --> 48:10.963
Amaia told me her dad liked it.

48:11.713 --> 48:13.338
He thought it was brave.

48:13.672 --> 48:16.088
Her mother started reading it,
then stopped.

48:16.255 --> 48:19.338
I'm not surprised.
The killers were her children.

48:21.963 --> 48:23.547
The last ones of the season.

48:23.713 --> 48:25.255
They're the best.

48:25.547 --> 48:28.380
Mum, speak to Olmo in Spanish.

48:29.255 --> 48:31.963
- Sorry.
- No, please.

48:32.505 --> 48:34.338
I love hearing you speak Basque.

48:34.588 --> 48:35.672
Look at that.

48:35.838 --> 48:36.963
He's not mute after all.

48:37.130 --> 48:38.422
You don't understand, Olmo.

48:38.630 --> 48:42.255
He probably just doesn't want
to understand us.

48:42.797 --> 48:47.963
It was the language of my paternal
grandparents from Guernica.

48:48.380 --> 48:51.130
They escaped the bombing
during the war.

48:51.297 --> 48:54.922
They took my father
to the Soviet Union when he was seven.

48:55.213 --> 48:59.380
If you speak to me in Basque,
I might be able to learn.

48:59.630 --> 49:01.088
So you have Basque blood.

49:02.047 --> 49:03.047
Blood?

49:04.713 --> 49:06.547
I don't know
what blood I have anymore.

49:15.172 --> 49:16.505
What's your problem, Olmo?

49:18.172 --> 49:20.713
Why can't I bring
dead people back to life?

49:21.630 --> 49:24.630
Because what is dead is dead.

49:24.797 --> 49:26.672
It's only a novel.

49:27.922 --> 49:29.838
Well, I don't like it.

49:33.630 --> 49:35.713
You have to tell me about your past.

49:36.172 --> 49:38.672
I know almost nothing about you
since Russia.

49:39.588 --> 49:40.672
Before we got married,

49:42.588 --> 49:44.172
we said you would never ask.

49:44.297 --> 49:45.630
No, you said.

49:47.588 --> 49:49.838
But I can't bear not knowing.

49:52.338 --> 49:54.713
Those 14 years in Spain
before we met.

49:55.338 --> 49:57.005
What was your life like?

50:02.422 --> 50:04.130
Olmo, I'm your wife!

50:04.838 --> 50:06.630
And I'm also a writer.

50:07.338 --> 50:09.005
Tell me what you did!

50:09.588 --> 50:11.922
Who the fuck are you?

50:13.963 --> 50:15.630
Amaia grew suspicious.

50:17.797 --> 50:19.005
Olmo could feel it.

50:19.172 --> 50:22.338
There was a cold distance
between them.

50:22.672 --> 50:24.922
But in bed, Olmo still had her.

50:30.838 --> 50:31.838
Burning hot.

50:33.797 --> 50:35.713
Sex had them fused together.

50:39.338 --> 50:42.338
Until the last night
they ever spent together.

51:41.130 --> 51:42.338
BURNING HOT BODIES

51:42.505 --> 51:43.797
Now that, I like.

51:44.047 --> 51:45.963
No dead people, just life.

51:46.338 --> 51:50.505
Right, because it's you and me
going crazy for sex.

51:50.797 --> 51:52.797
It's all there is between us, Olmo.

51:55.380 --> 51:57.338
This will be our first time apart.

51:58.047 --> 51:59.755
I'll only be in Barcelona for a day.

52:00.713 --> 52:04.297
I want to give Nuria the manuscript
then sign a contract...

52:05.672 --> 52:06.963
Will you still be here?

52:09.630 --> 52:10.630
What do you want?

52:11.172 --> 52:13.088
I want you to wait for me

52:14.047 --> 52:16.255
so we can discuss our relationship.

52:18.505 --> 52:21.172
Shall we go outside?
There's a full moon.

52:34.922 --> 52:36.880
I like joining my branches to yours.

52:37.213 --> 52:39.213
Tomorrow we'll have the whole tree.

52:39.963 --> 52:42.963
With all its blood and truth.

52:47.297 --> 52:48.297
Let's continue.

52:55.463 --> 52:58.380
In the morning,
Olmo took Amaia to the airport.

52:59.005 --> 53:02.838
IN THE MORNING,
OLMO TOOK AMAIA TO THE AIRPORT.

53:09.380 --> 53:11.672
I want a proper goodbye kiss.

53:12.838 --> 53:16.047
One of yours.
Nice and deep.

53:30.713 --> 53:32.255
I'm taking your taste with me.

53:55.838 --> 53:56.922
<i>Who is she?</i>

53:57.463 --> 53:59.672
<i>I'll tell you later
about the Russian, Veronika.</i>

54:06.505 --> 54:09.463
<i>My mother didn't like
Amaia's erotic novel.</i>

54:10.172 --> 54:12.088
So you're not going to publish it?

54:12.922 --> 54:13.922
No.

54:14.505 --> 54:15.505
For your own good.

54:16.130 --> 54:19.047
It's a step down.
You're better than this.

54:20.838 --> 54:21.963
Write another.

54:25.713 --> 54:29.838
Some local guy is taking liberties.
He's on our turf.

54:29.963 --> 54:32.755
They want you to teach him a lesson.

54:34.588 --> 54:35.880
One he won't forget?

54:36.297 --> 54:40.130
Nothing major.
A knee, a hand...

54:44.130 --> 54:45.755
Then you can sing for me.

54:51.797 --> 54:55.338
I thought it was an accident,
but one day Olmo told me...

54:55.547 --> 54:59.047
<i>My mum told Amaia how she met
Olmo at her house in Lloret.</i>

54:59.672 --> 55:03.713
Olmo told me to invite Dimitri,
the Georgian, and...

55:03.880 --> 55:04.713
<i>Stop.</i>

55:04.880 --> 55:08.088
<i>I left something out,
in order to tell you now.</i>

55:08.422 --> 55:11.047
When Olmo told my mum he'd been

55:11.213 --> 55:14.297
<i>her dad's driver and bodyguard,
he offered to help her.</i>

55:16.630 --> 55:20.255
Invite your Georgian lover over
this afternoon.

55:20.422 --> 55:23.213
Tell him you have
an interesting offer for him.

55:40.922 --> 55:44.422
My boss is coming.
Your father has no business here.

55:44.630 --> 55:47.047
Neither do you.

55:56.505 --> 55:57.963
He killed him?

55:58.130 --> 55:59.338
Like a professional.

55:59.547 --> 56:00.547
Like a professional.

56:08.130 --> 56:09.588
Pack your things, right now.

56:10.088 --> 56:11.547
I'll get you out of here.

56:19.463 --> 56:23.213
Rebeca, we chose this night
for a reason.

56:23.380 --> 56:24.838
So get ready.

56:25.547 --> 56:27.547
It's a full moon for everybody.

56:41.005 --> 56:43.172
The moon over the Mediterranean.

56:45.463 --> 56:47.297
It's for you, Julieta.

57:34.838 --> 57:35.880
What's wrong, Mum?

57:37.838 --> 57:39.172
Nothing.

57:39.880 --> 57:41.880
I wanted to write a song.

57:42.172 --> 57:43.963
The moon has always inspired me.

57:45.172 --> 57:46.672
But his voice won't let me.

57:46.838 --> 57:47.963
Don't you realise?

57:48.630 --> 57:50.213
I'm nobody now.

57:50.380 --> 57:53.838
Ever since you were born,
I haven't been La Maca.

57:53.963 --> 57:55.755
I haven't written one song!

58:06.088 --> 58:07.963
<i>They forced me to be your child!</i>

58:08.088 --> 58:09.088
No!

58:09.338 --> 58:10.130
No.

58:10.338 --> 58:11.463
Mum, it's me.

58:11.672 --> 58:12.505
No.

58:12.672 --> 58:15.463
<i>I hate you, Mother!
Kill me again!</i>

58:34.422 --> 58:36.047
You're not going to hurt me.

58:36.213 --> 58:39.338
Fight! You can beat him!

59:21.588 --> 59:23.963
<i>My father arrived late
too many times.</i>

59:24.588 --> 59:27.505
<i>And sometimes too late
for a salesman.</i>

59:28.505 --> 59:29.880
Are you OK?

59:30.047 --> 59:32.255
<i>That night he smelled of perfume.</i>

59:32.880 --> 59:34.588
<i>My mother never held it against him.</i>

59:38.505 --> 59:40.047
Forgive me, my love.

59:41.172 --> 59:43.338
I only live for your forgiveness.

01:00:01.713 --> 01:00:02.713
Hello.

01:00:03.172 --> 01:00:07.130
<i>Seeing Amaia reminded me of you
and of the wedding.</i>

01:00:07.463 --> 01:00:08.463
Hello.

01:00:08.755 --> 01:00:11.797
<i>A song is heard,</i>

01:00:12.047 --> 01:00:14.672
<i>yet unheard,</i>

01:00:15.047 --> 01:00:19.963
<i>in these silent nights.</i>

01:00:20.838 --> 01:00:24.005
<i>Why do you, dear,</i>

01:00:24.505 --> 01:00:27.463
<i>look askance,</i>

01:00:28.088 --> 01:00:32.838
<i>with your head lowered so?</i>

01:00:33.255 --> 01:00:37.255
<i>It is hard to express...</i>

01:00:37.797 --> 01:00:39.338
Still not answering?

01:00:40.005 --> 01:00:41.130
No.

01:00:42.297 --> 01:00:44.797
My parents say
he hasn't been back all day.

01:02:08.505 --> 01:02:10.713
I was dreaming all night long.

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.963
Because this is Olmo and Amaia's bed.

01:02:17.338 --> 01:02:20.963
I like what we're doing,
both of us telling our story,

01:02:21.255 --> 01:02:22.797
from our guts.

01:02:27.088 --> 01:02:31.338
The tree of our blood, mixed.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.422
How about another fuck?

01:02:40.963 --> 01:02:44.630
Tonight, when we finish,
we'll celebrate.

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:48.380
I'm going to shower.

01:03:46.922 --> 01:03:49.380
<i>Hello, Olmo.
You didn't sleep at home.</i>

01:03:50.505 --> 01:03:52.380
Should I make it easy
and pack my bags?

01:04:00.588 --> 01:04:02.380
The wardrobe is already open.

01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:05.213
<i>Empty your side then.</i>

01:04:17.047 --> 01:04:19.505
I told you this wouldn't last.

01:04:20.088 --> 01:04:22.963
I feel bad.
Especially for our daughter.

01:04:24.088 --> 01:04:26.755
Mother, Father, goodbye.

01:04:27.172 --> 01:04:28.963
And thank you, from my heart.

01:04:53.130 --> 01:04:54.380
Let's continue.

01:04:57.588 --> 01:04:58.588
Ready?

01:05:12.213 --> 01:05:15.338
<i>My father encouraged Olmo
to come and live with us.</i>

01:05:26.297 --> 01:05:27.463
Thank you.

01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:32.713
It'll be OK.

01:05:42.088 --> 01:05:44.005
Rebeca has given up her room.

01:05:44.505 --> 01:05:45.922
There's no need, Rebeca.

01:05:46.047 --> 01:05:48.005
I'll sleep in the next room over.

01:05:48.172 --> 01:05:50.338
But if you don't mind,

01:05:50.922 --> 01:05:54.130
we'll have to share the wardrobe.

01:05:55.963 --> 01:05:56.963
Sure.

01:06:00.963 --> 01:06:02.255
Thank you, Rebeca.

01:06:57.255 --> 01:06:59.255
<i>Olmo was always at home.</i>

01:07:01.963 --> 01:07:03.963
<i>And my dad kept coming home late.</i>

01:07:04.088 --> 01:07:05.088
Hello.

01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:15.130
<i>My mother was always on time.</i>

01:07:16.338 --> 01:07:18.713
<i>And with Amaia cooking,
we ate much better.</i>

01:07:25.505 --> 01:07:27.047
But Amaia was up to something.

01:07:28.713 --> 01:07:29.755
Something bigger.

01:07:30.297 --> 01:07:32.047
<i>When my mother told her
about Olmo,</i>

01:07:32.213 --> 01:07:35.672
<i>Amaia decided to write
about the Russian mafia in Spain.</i>

01:07:35.838 --> 01:07:37.713
<i>She'd spent three years researching.</i>

01:07:38.047 --> 01:07:41.255
<i>One afternoon, she told us
her latest discoveries.</i>

01:07:41.422 --> 01:07:42.422
My theory

01:07:42.588 --> 01:07:46.755
is that Olmo Mendoza worked as
your parents' driver and bodyguard

01:07:46.922 --> 01:07:48.713
to get information about your family.

01:07:49.047 --> 01:07:50.213
As a spy?

01:07:50.755 --> 01:07:53.422
Olmo was a soldier
for a major Russian mafia gang.

01:07:53.588 --> 01:07:57.380
The boss was his father,
Jacinto Mendoza.

01:07:57.547 --> 01:08:00.588
He sent his sons Víctor and Olmo
from Russia

01:08:00.755 --> 01:08:02.797
to set up on the Costa Brava.

01:08:02.963 --> 01:08:06.130
But the Georgians
also wanted Lloret de Mar.

01:08:06.338 --> 01:08:09.005
They ran over your parents
to eliminate Olmo

01:08:09.088 --> 01:08:10.588
and extort money from you.

01:08:10.755 --> 01:08:11.755
That's what they did.

01:08:11.922 --> 01:08:14.088
They made me sell for a pittance.

01:08:14.172 --> 01:08:17.671
It became the HQ of the Georgian mafia
on that coast.

01:08:18.837 --> 01:08:20.837
If the Georgians hadn't arrived,

01:08:21.005 --> 01:08:22.962
would Olmo have kept the house?

01:08:23.046 --> 01:08:26.712
Sure. And Jacinto Mendoza
would be living there now.

01:08:27.462 --> 01:08:30.962
Why did he kill Dimitri if he knew
he couldn't stop the Georgians?

01:08:31.212 --> 01:08:32.212
For honour.

01:08:35.296 --> 01:08:37.671
You never knew you had married...?

01:08:37.837 --> 01:08:39.587
A member of a criminal organisation?

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:45.212
I knew Olmo was hiding
something bad from his past,

01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:46.712
but he never seemed dangerous.

01:08:47.755 --> 01:08:51.046
- Did he have tattoos?
- Yes, I liked them.

01:08:51.296 --> 01:08:55.337
- Did you see any tattoos?
- Yes, a few.

01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:57.160
And you didn't suspect anything?

01:08:58.962 --> 01:09:00.212
What about Víctor?

01:09:00.962 --> 01:09:03.630
<i>- My dad?
- Did he have tattoos?</i>

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:07.880
<i>Just a tattoo of my mum's face
on his shoulder.</i>

01:09:11.130 --> 01:09:12.671
Maybe to cover another.

01:09:12.837 --> 01:09:13.880
What?

01:09:17.087 --> 01:09:18.671
Let's do my mum's wedding.

01:09:19.130 --> 01:09:21.837
I personally made sure
you were invited.

01:09:21.962 --> 01:09:22.962
Thanks.

01:09:23.005 --> 01:09:24.505
Otherwise, we wouldn't be here.

01:09:29.005 --> 01:09:31.630
Sorry! I overslept.

01:09:40.962 --> 01:09:43.337
Last time I saw you in a suit
was your wedding.

01:09:43.505 --> 01:09:46.337
You looked so handsome.

01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:54.797
- Is this the same suit?
- Yes.

01:09:57.797 --> 01:10:00.130
It's your ex-wife's wedding.
She'll notice.

01:10:12.213 --> 01:10:13.213
What's this?

01:10:14.172 --> 01:10:16.380
Two bulls butting heads.

01:10:17.588 --> 01:10:18.672
You and Víctor?

01:10:45.672 --> 01:10:49.005
Your suit and my dress want to dance.

01:10:51.463 --> 01:10:54.547
If it was their wedding day,
what would they say?

01:10:57.047 --> 01:11:01.297
My dress would say "I do".

01:11:02.963 --> 01:11:05.630
What about you, suit,

01:11:06.963 --> 01:11:08.422
do you take my dress?

01:11:12.838 --> 01:11:14.505
Say "I do", silly. It's a game.

01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:18.380
I'm not playing that game.

01:11:25.255 --> 01:11:27.422
It was a game to tell you the truth.

01:11:29.797 --> 01:11:32.088
The biggest truth
that I've kept inside

01:11:33.505 --> 01:11:35.047
for the last four years.

01:11:36.422 --> 01:11:38.172
Since I was 14.

01:11:40.255 --> 01:11:42.672
<i>What do you mean
"the biggest truth"?</i>

01:11:42.963 --> 01:11:46.547
- It was the first time ever.
- That you said you loved someone?

01:11:47.130 --> 01:11:49.213
It was, but it wasn't.

01:11:50.297 --> 01:11:53.588
I didn't want anything.
Just to say it and get it out.

01:11:54.130 --> 01:11:55.130
And what did he say?

01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:57.422
What did he say?

01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:02.713
I'm 30 years older than you.

01:12:03.088 --> 01:12:04.213
And I'm your uncle.

01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:08.880
"Relax, Uncle Olmo.
We're not blood-related."

01:12:09.047 --> 01:12:11.130
We're not blood-related.

01:12:13.547 --> 01:12:15.088
<i>You're contradicting yourself.</i>

01:12:15.963 --> 01:12:17.255
<i>You did want more.</i>

01:12:27.672 --> 01:12:30.338
As the Lebanese poet
Khalil Gibran said:

01:12:30.505 --> 01:12:32.338
"Love one another,

01:12:32.755 --> 01:12:35.047
but make not a bond of love".

01:12:36.338 --> 01:12:40.963
Amaia, do you take Nuria
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

01:12:41.088 --> 01:12:42.297
I do.

01:12:42.672 --> 01:12:46.755
Nuria, do you take Amaia
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

01:12:46.963 --> 01:12:48.297
I do.

01:12:48.672 --> 01:12:49.963
Nuria, Amaia...

01:12:50.130 --> 01:12:51.463
I do too.

01:12:51.630 --> 01:12:53.630
I now declare you
joined in matrimony.

01:13:09.422 --> 01:13:10.672
I can't see your parents.

01:13:10.838 --> 01:13:12.588
Don't they know?

01:13:13.838 --> 01:13:17.588
What? That you're wearing
the suit from our wedding?

01:13:19.005 --> 01:13:21.255
No, I didn't dare tell them.

01:13:21.422 --> 01:13:25.088
But soon we'll go up to the farm
and tell them together.

01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:29.963
What happened to your erotic novel?

01:13:31.338 --> 01:13:32.880
I'm working on another now.

01:13:33.047 --> 01:13:35.088
In fact, I wanted to call you

01:13:35.255 --> 01:13:38.630
to ask about your time
with the Russian mafia.

01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:46.130
I know.

01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:48.630
You took a vow of silence, right?

01:13:56.672 --> 01:13:57.672
Hello.

01:14:01.213 --> 01:14:03.755
What did you feel for me then?

01:14:05.047 --> 01:14:06.963
I liked how you kissed me twice.

01:14:13.297 --> 01:14:15.297
<i>I loved the way you looked at me.</i>

01:14:17.922 --> 01:14:20.505
- Nothing else?
- Not then, no.

01:14:20.672 --> 01:14:22.963
<i>Then I'm glad I kept trying</i>

01:14:23.005 --> 01:14:25.338
<i>and asked you
the first thing that came to me.</i>

01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:32.047
What are you going to study?

01:14:33.422 --> 01:14:35.172
I have no idea.

01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:37.838
I only have a week
to make my mind up.

01:14:39.755 --> 01:14:41.422
I'm going to do film studies.

01:14:41.713 --> 01:14:43.130
In Alicante.

01:14:44.213 --> 01:14:46.297
But there are good schools
in Barcelona.

01:14:47.922 --> 01:14:50.463
I don't want to live
with two newlyweds.

01:14:54.338 --> 01:14:55.588
Film?

01:15:00.088 --> 01:15:02.922
Yes, as I said. Film studies.

01:15:05.547 --> 01:15:06.880
Shall we dance?

01:16:00.547 --> 01:16:01.547
Anyway...

01:16:01.922 --> 01:16:05.172
That autumn,
we went to study film in Alicante.

01:16:05.338 --> 01:16:06.755
And to fuck every day.

01:16:11.963 --> 01:16:13.797
<i>That changed our lives.</i>

01:16:31.297 --> 01:16:33.547
<i>But you insisted on going home
every weekend.</i>

01:16:33.713 --> 01:16:35.463
You to Madrid and me to Barcelona.

01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:37.088
You know my mother was unwell.

01:16:37.255 --> 01:16:39.963
- Was that the reason?
- Don't you remember what she did?

01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:44.422
In eight months, not a single
weekend spent together.

01:16:45.255 --> 01:16:46.422
Rebeca,

01:16:46.797 --> 01:16:49.880
we each have our owns truths
that are hard for the other,

01:16:49.963 --> 01:16:52.422
but we agreed to tell them here.

01:16:52.963 --> 01:16:54.505
Secret truths, you said.

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:56.547
It was more your idea than mine.

01:16:58.588 --> 01:17:01.338
Go ahead, tell me your truths

01:17:01.505 --> 01:17:03.297
then I'll tell you mine.

01:17:06.297 --> 01:17:09.047
During those weekends in Barcelona,

01:17:09.713 --> 01:17:12.713
Amaia told me her latest discoveries
about the Mendozas,

01:17:13.672 --> 01:17:15.463
increasingly unpleasant things.

01:17:15.838 --> 01:17:18.005
Meanwhile,
you were with two of them.

01:17:18.088 --> 01:17:19.130
One was your dad.

01:17:19.213 --> 01:17:21.255
Leave my dad out of this, please.

01:17:21.338 --> 01:17:23.463
Your dad worked alongside Olmo.

01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:26.047
In fact, he was his superior.

01:17:27.047 --> 01:17:29.213
They started out money laundering.

01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:32.588
Buying hotels,
luxury apartments and houses.

01:17:33.005 --> 01:17:35.255
But when Jacinto Mendoza arrived,

01:17:35.422 --> 01:17:38.588
they ran more shady business
out of his villa in Denia.

01:17:38.672 --> 01:17:39.838
What do you mean shady?

01:17:39.922 --> 01:17:41.630
Real criminal activities.

01:17:41.797 --> 01:17:43.713
Maybe Marc shouldn't be hearing this.

01:17:43.797 --> 01:17:45.172
No, Mum, I want to know.

01:17:46.047 --> 01:17:48.088
- Marc, I'm scared.
- I want to know!

01:17:48.255 --> 01:17:51.713
- Do they know you're onto them?
- Who's "they"? The Mendozas?

01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:54.547
- I don't know.
- This is getting scary.

01:17:55.838 --> 01:17:56.838
Sorry,

01:17:57.047 --> 01:18:00.213
but I can't believe
my father would kill anyone.

01:18:00.588 --> 01:18:01.588
And Olmo?

01:18:03.297 --> 01:18:06.963
Both brothers spent a year
at their father's villa in Denia.

01:18:07.130 --> 01:18:09.922
That was '92,
the year you and I were born.

01:18:10.713 --> 01:18:13.505
<i>Víctor and Olmo followed
their boss's orders,</i>

01:18:14.047 --> 01:18:15.630
<i>like loyal soldiers.</i>

01:18:32.255 --> 01:18:35.422
<i>Then oddly,
both left home at the same time</i>

01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:38.422
<i>and became independent.</i>

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:40.922
<i>One went into prostitution.</i>

01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:44.588
<i>The other started a family.
Yours.</i>

01:18:45.255 --> 01:18:49.088
<i>But what was their last job
for their father?</i>

01:18:54.547 --> 01:18:55.797
You continue.

01:18:57.255 --> 01:18:59.172
Your mother's breakdown.

01:19:04.380 --> 01:19:06.380
That night I heard her singing
in the bath.

01:19:12.422 --> 01:19:14.255
<i>I liked listening to her.</i>

01:19:23.297 --> 01:19:27.338
<i>As her voice faded,
I realised I could only hear it</i>

01:19:27.505 --> 01:19:30.338
<i>because she'd left
the bathroom door open.</i>

01:19:34.588 --> 01:19:37.838
<i>It was late,
and my dad wasn't back from work.</i>

01:19:39.172 --> 01:19:40.713
<i>That was also why she did it.</i>

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:41.547
Mum.

01:19:41.713 --> 01:19:43.672
<i>That was the main reason.</i>

01:19:46.297 --> 01:19:47.297
Mum.

01:19:48.630 --> 01:19:49.713
Mum!

01:19:50.255 --> 01:19:51.088
Olmo!

01:19:51.255 --> 01:19:53.255
Olmo, my mum is dying!

01:19:53.422 --> 01:19:55.088
Mum! Mum!

01:19:56.588 --> 01:19:57.588
Olmo!

01:19:58.713 --> 01:19:59.880
Help me!

01:20:02.963 --> 01:20:05.463
It's OK, Mum. It's OK.

01:20:05.963 --> 01:20:07.172
It's OK.

01:20:07.630 --> 01:20:08.963
Oh, my God!

01:20:26.130 --> 01:20:28.005
You have to wait outside.

01:20:30.297 --> 01:20:33.130
The nurse will give you
some clean clothes.

01:21:52.838 --> 01:21:54.588
Do you have more tattoos?

01:22:03.630 --> 01:22:04.630
What does it mean?

01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:07.713
That I'm an eternal wanderer.

01:22:09.547 --> 01:22:10.547
I like it.

01:22:15.463 --> 01:22:17.380
You don't have a scar.

01:22:21.130 --> 01:22:22.630
You can't see my scar,

01:22:23.172 --> 01:22:25.005
but you can feel it.

01:22:42.463 --> 01:22:43.713
It's right here.

01:22:46.797 --> 01:22:50.047
Two life-saving operations
when I was a baby.

01:23:03.088 --> 01:23:06.672
<i>Víctor got there much later,
after my grandparents.</i>

01:23:06.838 --> 01:23:09.213
How dare you show up so late?

01:23:09.297 --> 01:23:11.463
Look at you!
Don't you dare tell her

01:23:11.630 --> 01:23:13.838
you're late
because you were working for me.

01:23:13.922 --> 01:23:15.630
You don't even know me.

01:23:15.797 --> 01:23:17.422
I know you're a drug addict.

01:23:17.505 --> 01:23:18.880
You were like an angel

01:23:19.047 --> 01:23:21.463
who appeared in our daughter's life.

01:23:21.547 --> 01:23:23.922
Now look at you!

01:23:24.088 --> 01:23:25.672
The drugs have made you a devil.

01:23:25.838 --> 01:23:27.255
- Made me a devil?
- Yes.

01:23:27.422 --> 01:23:30.380
Who are you to talk?

01:23:30.547 --> 01:23:32.880
Your morals rotted years ago.

01:23:33.047 --> 01:23:34.547
You bastard!

01:23:34.713 --> 01:23:35.713
Dad.

01:23:35.797 --> 01:23:36.797
Dad!

01:23:37.630 --> 01:23:39.713
Please, stop taking that shit.

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:42.213
I'm begging you.

01:23:47.755 --> 01:23:49.088
I'm her husband.

01:23:54.797 --> 01:23:55.963
I'm leaving.

01:23:56.630 --> 01:23:57.922
- I'm coming with you.
- Rebeca.

01:23:58.505 --> 01:24:00.338
We'll come and see her tomorrow.

01:24:12.422 --> 01:24:14.172
Remember "my biggest truth"?

01:24:14.297 --> 01:24:16.213
Remember my biggest truth?

01:24:21.172 --> 01:24:22.755
Well, it's got bigger.

01:24:24.463 --> 01:24:26.088
I often dream about you,

01:24:26.922 --> 01:24:28.588
I can't help it.

01:24:33.713 --> 01:24:34.713
What about you?

01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:48.630
Well...

01:24:50.047 --> 01:24:52.213
We have the whole night to ourselves.

01:25:03.630 --> 01:25:05.130
What happened that night?

01:25:07.213 --> 01:25:08.547
What happened that night?

01:25:12.505 --> 01:25:15.255
I remember that after
your mother's suicide attempt,

01:25:15.713 --> 01:25:17.047
you seemed distant.

01:25:17.422 --> 01:25:18.505
Cold in bed.

01:25:18.672 --> 01:25:21.588
No. It was a difficult time
for my family.

01:25:22.297 --> 01:25:24.380
My dad had to change jobs and...

01:25:24.547 --> 01:25:27.172
he had to go away at weekends.

01:25:27.463 --> 01:25:29.963
My grandparents took Mum
to live with them

01:25:30.755 --> 01:25:32.380
and increased her medication.

01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:37.880
Good morning! Breakfast!

01:25:47.547 --> 01:25:49.213
Thank you, love.

01:25:50.005 --> 01:25:53.463
I've got a great plan for Easter.

01:25:53.630 --> 01:25:54.838
- Really?
- Yes.

01:25:55.005 --> 01:25:59.963
Just you and me, four days alone
at a place in the Pyrenees.

01:26:00.130 --> 01:26:02.713
I'll show you
some beautiful villages.

01:26:04.630 --> 01:26:05.630
Sound good?

01:26:08.547 --> 01:26:09.547
Finally!

01:26:17.422 --> 01:26:19.130
After breakfast.

01:26:21.047 --> 01:26:22.047
I'm going to shower.

01:26:22.213 --> 01:26:23.213
OK.

01:26:48.005 --> 01:26:50.255
<i>Rebeca, this is a surprise.</i>

01:26:52.547 --> 01:26:54.713
I wanted to wish you a good holiday.

01:26:55.213 --> 01:26:57.922
<i>Thanks, it's going to be a long one.</i>

01:26:58.880 --> 01:26:59.963
Why's that?

01:27:00.338 --> 01:27:02.088
<i>I'm going to live in the Pyrenees.</i>

01:27:03.422 --> 01:27:07.005
The Pyrenees? Where exactly?

01:27:08.297 --> 01:27:10.922
<i>To a house near Monte Perdido.</i>

01:27:12.422 --> 01:27:13.963
Are you going alone?

01:27:14.130 --> 01:27:16.088
<i>I'm meeting someone there.</i>

01:27:18.588 --> 01:27:19.963
A woman.

01:27:20.297 --> 01:27:21.838
<i>An old acquaintance.</i>

01:27:22.005 --> 01:27:23.005
Lucky lady.

01:27:27.922 --> 01:27:29.047
OK.

01:27:30.338 --> 01:27:32.213
You weren't going to say goodbye?

01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:34.380
<i>It's better without goodbyes.</i>

01:27:34.797 --> 01:27:38.297
<i>You have your life, at your age.
And I have mine.</i>

01:27:39.088 --> 01:27:40.463
When are you leaving?

01:27:41.005 --> 01:27:42.422
<i>Day after tomorrow.</i>

01:27:44.547 --> 01:27:45.922
I'll call you back.

01:27:52.422 --> 01:27:55.963
My mother,
she's freaking out again.

01:27:59.172 --> 01:28:00.547
She needs me. I'm sorry.

01:28:05.505 --> 01:28:06.505
Forgive me.

01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:08.880
My poor love. Forgive me.

01:28:09.588 --> 01:28:11.047
You make me sick!

01:28:46.255 --> 01:28:49.755
"Marc, all I know is that you are

01:28:50.963 --> 01:28:52.963
my biggest truth."

01:29:01.172 --> 01:29:02.172
Marc.

01:29:02.255 --> 01:29:03.255
Marc!

01:29:05.838 --> 01:29:06.838
Marc.

01:29:07.755 --> 01:29:09.255
All I can say is I'm sorry.

01:29:09.422 --> 01:29:10.755
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:29:10.963 --> 01:29:13.630
You don't know how sorry I am.
I love you.

01:29:13.838 --> 01:29:14.838
You're sorry?

01:29:18.672 --> 01:29:22.088
I don't know what will
happen to us now.

01:29:22.255 --> 01:29:24.172
Nothing but truth between us.

01:29:24.338 --> 01:29:27.797
Yes, I've finally heard your truth.

01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:30.880
But I've stopped believing you.

01:29:32.380 --> 01:29:35.213
- And right now I'm done with you.
- No.

01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:37.422
No, no! Marc, no!
Please! Marc!

01:29:37.588 --> 01:29:39.005
Marc. No.

01:29:40.255 --> 01:29:42.797
I stood by you for a year
after your operation.

01:29:43.130 --> 01:29:45.713
We've lived together
for two years.

01:29:45.963 --> 01:29:47.797
You can't leave me like this.

01:29:48.172 --> 01:29:49.505
Why?

01:29:50.463 --> 01:29:52.755
Because I chose
to tell you the truth?

01:29:53.088 --> 01:29:55.130
A truth which is... old!

01:29:55.297 --> 01:29:57.422
- Dead!
- Yes.

01:29:59.047 --> 01:30:00.713
And you're alive.

01:30:00.922 --> 01:30:05.588
And we have to tell that part
of this story we're writing together.

01:30:07.547 --> 01:30:08.880
Please.

01:30:09.213 --> 01:30:10.713
The rest of it is staggering.

01:30:11.838 --> 01:30:13.547
- You finish it.
- No.

01:30:13.713 --> 01:30:15.755
I don't want this fucking story.

01:30:15.963 --> 01:30:17.255
It's all yours.

01:30:39.047 --> 01:30:40.588
Please, don't leave me like this.

01:30:41.172 --> 01:30:43.172
A mile from here,
there's a train to Bilbao.

01:30:44.213 --> 01:30:45.630
From there, take a bus to Madrid.

01:30:45.838 --> 01:30:48.005
No, no, please. Stay!

01:30:48.172 --> 01:30:49.505
Let's write the end together.

01:30:49.672 --> 01:30:52.963
Then you can go to Barcelona
and take time to think about us.

01:30:53.088 --> 01:30:54.255
Think?

01:30:54.672 --> 01:30:55.755
Yes.

01:30:56.547 --> 01:31:01.213
It kills me to think
how far you went to betray me.

01:32:13.672 --> 01:32:14.672
What happened?

01:32:21.422 --> 01:32:22.422
Hello.

01:32:22.588 --> 01:32:23.672
Hello.

01:32:23.838 --> 01:32:26.963
Come here, Xian.
Give your brother a big kiss.

01:32:53.463 --> 01:32:55.047
Did you finish it?

01:32:56.588 --> 01:32:58.047
Not right to the end.

01:33:01.380 --> 01:33:04.838
Then it's worthless,
like it doesn't exist.

01:33:07.130 --> 01:33:08.380
It doesn't exist anymore.

01:33:09.297 --> 01:33:13.338
I encouraged you
to go write your stories together.

01:33:14.547 --> 01:33:16.255
In my study.

01:33:16.963 --> 01:33:20.838
With my tree outside, so it could be
the tree of your great story.

01:33:21.172 --> 01:33:22.547
With all of us in it.

01:33:23.088 --> 01:33:25.922
To clear up the shadows
in your relationship.

01:33:26.255 --> 01:33:27.963
And that was going to hurt.

01:33:29.338 --> 01:33:34.088
You have to finish it,
even if apart.

01:33:41.005 --> 01:33:44.255
Rebeca, the best thing now
is to do nothing,

01:33:44.422 --> 01:33:46.963
don't move or think about anything.

01:33:47.130 --> 01:33:48.797
Just let yourself go.

01:33:49.588 --> 01:33:54.255
Next week, we'll hold your hand
and put you in the car.

01:33:54.422 --> 01:33:56.588
I'll pack your suitcase for you.

01:33:56.797 --> 01:34:00.338
We'll all spend the summer in Denia,
at your grandparents' villa.

01:34:02.963 --> 01:34:04.797
Give yourself time, Rebeca.

01:34:04.963 --> 01:34:07.005
You need a recovery period.

01:34:07.505 --> 01:34:10.963
By mid-August,
you'll start feeling human again.

01:34:11.088 --> 01:34:13.755
- He might reconsider and come back.
- No!

01:34:15.088 --> 01:34:16.588
I know him.

01:34:17.338 --> 01:34:19.422
And I saw how he looked at me.

01:34:19.963 --> 01:34:21.713
So don't even go there.

01:35:33.130 --> 01:35:34.880
The doctor said no smoking.

01:35:35.130 --> 01:35:37.213
I'm not inhaling. Look.

01:35:47.130 --> 01:35:48.422
Were those your father's cigars?

01:35:49.380 --> 01:35:52.172
Yes, and he lived to over 80.

01:35:52.630 --> 01:35:54.380
What did he do for work?

01:35:55.422 --> 01:35:56.755
Businessman.

01:35:57.088 --> 01:35:59.172
Yes, you've told me that before.

01:36:01.213 --> 01:36:02.713
But what business?

01:36:06.422 --> 01:36:08.172
Trafficking drugs?

01:36:08.713 --> 01:36:12.463
People? Guns? Organs?

01:36:12.672 --> 01:36:13.672
Money laundering?

01:36:13.838 --> 01:36:16.422
Extortion? Beatings?
Contract killings? You know.

01:36:17.255 --> 01:36:18.588
I don't know.

01:36:26.255 --> 01:36:28.005
Well, I don't like this house.

01:36:28.672 --> 01:36:31.797
Then look the other way,
there's the sea.

01:38:09.047 --> 01:38:10.130
Hello.

01:38:14.463 --> 01:38:16.713
<i>Hello.</i>

01:38:19.047 --> 01:38:20.630
I'm composing again.

01:38:21.588 --> 01:38:23.005
La Maca is back.

01:38:24.963 --> 01:38:27.963
I've finally got something to say,
after 25 years.

01:38:28.130 --> 01:38:30.213
That's your entire life.

01:38:36.255 --> 01:38:38.005
And it's thanks to her.

01:38:41.463 --> 01:38:43.297
We both suffered so much.

01:38:44.922 --> 01:38:47.338
Julieta must have known all along.

01:38:47.505 --> 01:38:49.380
So she hid inside herself.

01:38:49.547 --> 01:38:52.672
Shut every door and window
to the world.

01:38:53.547 --> 01:38:54.880
What are you talking about?

01:38:56.922 --> 01:38:59.463
Something that happened to us both
the year you were born.

01:39:00.630 --> 01:39:02.255
My operation?

01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:07.255
If I'd met her then
and she'd told me the truth...

01:39:07.463 --> 01:39:08.463
What truth?

01:39:09.255 --> 01:39:11.172
She'd have woken up

01:39:11.422 --> 01:39:14.880
and I'd have been freed
from that damn kid's voice.

01:39:14.963 --> 01:39:15.963
Mum.

01:39:17.505 --> 01:39:18.838
What happened with my operation?

01:39:19.297 --> 01:39:21.755
This mother will never

01:39:21.963 --> 01:39:25.880
speak to her daughter about
what she now shares with Julieta.

01:39:27.422 --> 01:39:29.338
But I will sing it to you.

01:39:38.547 --> 01:39:42.713
<i>Dark and sad secret</i>

01:39:43.963 --> 01:39:47.463
<i>which I cannot say.</i>

01:39:49.838 --> 01:39:52.588
<i>Having lost consciousness,</i>

01:39:54.005 --> 01:39:57.172
<i>all I can do is sing.</i>

01:40:19.505 --> 01:40:24.255
Marc, forgive me
for barging in on you.

01:40:30.422 --> 01:40:33.630
<i>I wouldn't do this
if it wasn't important.</i>

01:40:34.547 --> 01:40:37.838
My mother says she received
a message from Julieta

01:40:38.047 --> 01:40:42.047
about the operation
I had as a baby.

01:40:44.380 --> 01:40:46.922
<i>I asked my dad
and he denies it.</i>

01:40:47.963 --> 01:40:49.672
<i>But I can tell something's off.</i>

01:41:03.672 --> 01:41:06.005
Did you know Rebeca
was operated on after birth?

01:41:07.463 --> 01:41:11.463
They told her
that her chest was cut open twice.

01:41:12.005 --> 01:41:14.672
They gave her
a multiple organ transplant.

01:41:15.713 --> 01:41:19.213
I checked after our accident,
but I didn't tell you.

01:41:19.547 --> 01:41:20.963
And who was the donor?

01:41:25.838 --> 01:41:28.672
A child, with no name.

01:41:32.047 --> 01:41:35.297
A baby boy from a slum
on the outskirts of Madrid,

01:41:35.463 --> 01:41:37.338
who one day disappeared.

01:41:38.047 --> 01:41:40.547
- Easy as that.
- It was not easy.

01:41:40.713 --> 01:41:44.672
First they had to kidnap several kids
and extract their blood

01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:48.422
to check the blood group
and antigens,

01:41:48.588 --> 01:41:50.422
which had to match Rebeca's.

01:41:50.963 --> 01:41:54.213
That's how they chose
the boy they emptied.

01:41:54.380 --> 01:41:56.380
Who killed that baby?

01:41:57.838 --> 01:42:00.338
Money.
Rebeca's grandfather's money.

01:42:00.505 --> 01:42:01.505
Who killed him?

01:42:02.255 --> 01:42:03.547
I prefer to leave it there.

01:42:03.713 --> 01:42:05.422
- I want you to tell me.
- I don't want to.

01:42:10.255 --> 01:42:13.505
After everything we've been through.

01:42:14.130 --> 01:42:17.130
I couldn't even bring myself
to finish the novel.

01:42:19.963 --> 01:42:22.963
Come on.
Let's go to bed, my love.

01:42:38.672 --> 01:42:40.422
<i>Ready to do the ending?</i>

01:42:42.380 --> 01:42:43.588
Let's do it.

01:42:44.963 --> 01:42:46.463
Who starts?

01:42:47.130 --> 01:42:48.130
You.

01:42:48.922 --> 01:42:49.922
Right.

01:42:53.755 --> 01:42:55.588
After dropping out on you

01:42:55.755 --> 01:42:57.547
<i>for our trip away for Easter...</i>

01:42:58.297 --> 01:42:59.547
<i>Or, more accurately,</i>

01:42:59.713 --> 01:43:01.005
after lying to you

01:43:01.172 --> 01:43:04.922
and using my mum's health
as an excuse to go to Madrid...

01:43:05.422 --> 01:43:07.880
<i>The truth is
I didn't even see my mum.</i>

01:43:08.922 --> 01:43:13.005
<i>I went to my dad's house,
just to see Olmo.</i>

01:43:14.213 --> 01:43:16.380
<i>I was so obsessed with him</i>

01:43:16.547 --> 01:43:21.838
<i>I didn't even care
that my dad's nerves were shot</i>

01:43:22.338 --> 01:43:24.172
<i>and getting worse by the day.</i>

01:43:24.338 --> 01:43:26.338
<i>I'd never heard him like that.</i>

01:43:27.338 --> 01:43:30.797
I do everything for everybody!
What do you do?

01:43:30.963 --> 01:43:33.755
All that coke will kill you!
Get a grip!

01:43:33.922 --> 01:43:35.047
- Idiot!
- Asshole!

01:43:36.297 --> 01:43:38.213
- Don't ever come back!
- Yeah, yeah.

01:43:42.172 --> 01:43:43.463
What are you doing here?

01:43:47.463 --> 01:43:48.713
Just drive, please!

01:43:48.922 --> 01:43:50.797
Where the fuck are you taking Rebeca?

01:43:50.963 --> 01:43:51.963
She got in herself.

01:43:52.088 --> 01:43:54.005
No way! You two? No fucking way!

01:43:54.172 --> 01:43:57.088
I knew it.
I didn't want to even imagine it.

01:43:57.255 --> 01:43:58.797
- Get inside!
- Dad!

01:43:58.963 --> 01:44:00.922
I'll explain, but not now.

01:44:01.047 --> 01:44:03.630
- I hate seeing you like this.
- Inside!

01:44:05.505 --> 01:44:06.505
Dad, no! No!

01:44:06.672 --> 01:44:08.713
- Víctor!
- Dad, no! Please!

01:44:08.922 --> 01:44:11.047
- Please, don't!
- You don't know who Olmo is.

01:44:11.213 --> 01:44:13.505
- Dad, you're hurting me!
- You have no idea!

01:44:16.047 --> 01:44:17.213
Calm down.

01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:19.005
Don't fight!

01:44:19.255 --> 01:44:21.130
No, no! Stop it!
Stop fighting!

01:44:25.672 --> 01:44:26.672
That's enough!

01:44:26.797 --> 01:44:27.838
Please!

01:44:35.213 --> 01:44:36.547
Dad.

01:44:37.172 --> 01:44:38.755
Dad, forgive me for this.

01:44:40.338 --> 01:44:42.630
But it's stronger than me.

01:44:43.255 --> 01:44:44.797
I need to go with him. I'm sorry.

01:44:45.047 --> 01:44:46.047
No!

01:44:46.713 --> 01:44:48.797
Drive. Drive.

01:45:06.255 --> 01:45:07.672
Do you want to take over?

01:45:11.255 --> 01:45:12.963
Since you'd ditched me,

01:45:13.088 --> 01:45:15.755
<i>my mum and Amaia
came with me to the Pyrenees.</i>

01:45:16.630 --> 01:45:19.505
Marc, should we keep
her Chinese name?

01:45:19.672 --> 01:45:21.172
I like the name Xian.

01:45:21.380 --> 01:45:23.297
I'd prefer a name from here.

01:45:24.672 --> 01:45:26.672
Yes, it might be better.

01:45:27.422 --> 01:45:28.797
When are you bringing her?

01:45:29.130 --> 01:45:30.672
This summer.

01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:37.172
Meanwhile, my grandparents
were also on the road.

01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:40.463
<i>They were meeting
my great uncle, the priest,</i>

01:45:40.630 --> 01:45:43.213
<i>at a monastery in Huesca.</i>

01:45:45.922 --> 01:45:48.630
<i>My mother was so lost,
she went with them.</i>

01:45:51.213 --> 01:45:53.047
<i>She was on a lot of meds.</i>

01:45:57.505 --> 01:45:59.755
<i>- Víctor.</i>
- Macarena.

01:46:00.797 --> 01:46:01.963
Maca!

01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:38.505
My date's been called off.

01:46:41.047 --> 01:46:42.547
Called off?

01:46:44.005 --> 01:46:46.797
I told her not to come,
that I'm not going.

01:46:47.755 --> 01:46:50.380
But you are going, aren't you?

01:46:51.588 --> 01:46:53.088
To Monte Perdido.

01:46:53.338 --> 01:46:54.672
With me.

01:46:55.213 --> 01:46:57.380
After everything
we're leaving behind...

01:46:59.255 --> 01:47:02.297
Yes, I'll go with you.

01:47:12.922 --> 01:47:15.338
You can take me
to the end of the world.

01:47:38.005 --> 01:47:41.088
<i>The Holy Burial advances slowly</i>

01:47:41.255 --> 01:47:43.672
<i>accompanied only
by the funeral march.</i>

01:47:47.922 --> 01:47:51.547
<i>...and to the members
of the Brotherhood of Triana.</i>

01:47:52.130 --> 01:47:54.213
<i>We are all equal! To Heaven!</i>

01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:07.922
Hello.

01:48:08.130 --> 01:48:10.422
- Are you at home?
<i>- Why?</i>

01:48:10.588 --> 01:48:12.297
Go into the maps app.

01:48:12.547 --> 01:48:15.172
So you can travel with me
for a while.

01:48:15.547 --> 01:48:17.005
I can't right now. I'm...

01:48:17.172 --> 01:48:18.963
<i>It's a road in Lérida,</i>

01:48:19.422 --> 01:48:21.422
between Alvifar and Cemalles.

01:48:26.088 --> 01:48:27.338
Alvifar.

01:48:29.005 --> 01:48:30.088
<i>Can you see it?</i>

01:48:30.255 --> 01:48:31.838
Yes, I can see it.

01:48:31.963 --> 01:48:33.547
The scenery is amazing.

01:48:33.963 --> 01:48:35.838
I wish you were here.

01:48:39.963 --> 01:48:41.047
Now I can see bulls.

01:48:43.130 --> 01:48:44.130
Bulls.

01:48:55.755 --> 01:48:57.380
What's going on here?

01:48:58.338 --> 01:48:59.755
I don't know.

01:49:11.255 --> 01:49:13.255
Come on. Just overtake me.

01:49:14.130 --> 01:49:16.630
- Who are they?
- They've been behind us for a while.

01:49:18.547 --> 01:49:20.005
They won't leave us alone.

01:49:20.172 --> 01:49:21.963
Them and their flashy car.

01:50:11.255 --> 01:50:12.422
They look dodgy.

01:50:16.130 --> 01:50:17.547
Something's wrong, Rebeca.

01:50:20.172 --> 01:50:21.588
The brakes aren't working!

01:50:28.422 --> 01:50:29.422
<i>Marc!</i>

01:50:38.547 --> 01:50:39.547
<i>Marc!</i>

01:50:40.713 --> 01:50:42.963
<i>Marc! Are you OK?</i>

01:51:08.797 --> 01:51:10.297
My love.

01:51:19.755 --> 01:51:21.172
How are you?

01:51:21.838 --> 01:51:22.838
Marc.

01:51:23.630 --> 01:51:24.797
Marc!

01:51:25.047 --> 01:51:26.255
I'm alive.

01:51:29.380 --> 01:51:31.088
Amaia, my love.

01:51:31.755 --> 01:51:33.630
- Answer me.
- Amaia.

01:51:33.963 --> 01:51:35.838
Amaia, talk to me.

01:51:35.963 --> 01:51:37.088
Amaia.

01:51:37.255 --> 01:51:39.005
What's wrong with Marc?

01:51:47.505 --> 01:51:48.505
What the...?

01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:01.088
I was...

01:52:02.130 --> 01:52:03.838
There was a...

01:52:31.005 --> 01:52:32.922
I was...

01:52:33.547 --> 01:52:35.047
There was a...

01:52:40.213 --> 01:52:41.213
Marc!

01:52:41.338 --> 01:52:42.338
Marc!

01:52:43.172 --> 01:52:44.172
Marc!

01:52:46.213 --> 01:52:47.588
Marc! Marc!

01:52:48.505 --> 01:52:49.505
Marc!

01:52:49.755 --> 01:52:50.380
Marc.

01:52:50.547 --> 01:52:52.838
<i>Rebeca, I don't remember
you being there.</i>

01:52:52.922 --> 01:52:54.297
<i>Yeah, I never told you.</i>

01:52:54.797 --> 01:52:55.797
Marc!

01:52:56.672 --> 01:52:57.963
Help! Help!

01:52:58.380 --> 01:52:59.963
Here! Over here!

01:53:00.130 --> 01:53:01.130
Marc!

01:53:01.463 --> 01:53:02.463
Marc!

01:53:03.422 --> 01:53:05.755
Please, make way.
Don't touch the wounded.

01:53:09.005 --> 01:53:11.005
Marc! Talk to me!

01:53:13.755 --> 01:53:16.547
Careful. Careful.

01:53:17.297 --> 01:53:20.463
No, I want to be with my son.

01:53:20.630 --> 01:53:22.047
- My God!
- Marc!

01:53:22.213 --> 01:53:23.213
My God.

01:53:23.380 --> 01:53:24.380
My God.

01:53:31.547 --> 01:53:32.547
Olmo.

01:53:42.505 --> 01:53:44.422
Where is Marc?

01:53:47.255 --> 01:53:48.255
Marc.

01:53:51.963 --> 01:53:53.588
I got her.

01:53:54.463 --> 01:53:55.838
Amaia!

01:53:57.088 --> 01:53:58.088
Amaia!

01:53:58.172 --> 01:54:00.088
It's alright, breathe.

01:54:08.505 --> 01:54:09.755
Amaia is alive!

01:54:09.922 --> 01:54:10.922
She's alive!

01:54:10.963 --> 01:54:12.797
Marc, Amaia is alive!

01:54:13.255 --> 01:54:15.380
I'll tell your mother.

01:54:18.505 --> 01:54:20.088
Nuria, Nuria.

01:54:20.255 --> 01:54:21.880
Amaia is alive.

01:54:22.005 --> 01:54:23.755
- Rebeca.
- Yes.

01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:28.797
Olmo is Marc's father.

01:55:10.797 --> 01:55:12.213
Amaia will be OK.

01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:14.922
She only broke her arm.

01:55:15.755 --> 01:55:16.797
And Nuria?

01:55:17.255 --> 01:55:19.130
She died in the ambulance.

01:55:25.672 --> 01:55:27.213
Poor Marc.

01:55:31.547 --> 01:55:34.755
Nuria told me you're Marc's father.

01:55:41.463 --> 01:55:43.005
Did you know?

01:55:43.547 --> 01:55:44.755
No.

01:56:00.963 --> 01:56:02.338
Grandpa?

01:56:05.505 --> 01:56:07.213
What are you doing here?

01:56:08.380 --> 01:56:11.297
An accident. We hit a cow.

01:56:14.172 --> 01:56:15.255
I'm sorry.

01:56:16.547 --> 01:56:19.130
- There's nothing we can do for him.
- No!

01:56:19.422 --> 01:56:21.838
No, don't say that.
There must be something.

01:56:22.047 --> 01:56:24.255
He needs a multiple organ transplant.

01:56:24.422 --> 01:56:26.130
And he only has a few hours.

01:56:26.297 --> 01:56:28.797
Yes, transplants save many lives.

01:56:28.963 --> 01:56:30.797
Yours being one of them.

01:56:30.963 --> 01:56:34.963
My wife needs a transplant.
I believe a woman has died.

01:56:35.088 --> 01:56:37.463
I can pay whatever it takes.

01:56:37.630 --> 01:56:39.838
There's nothing we can do for her.

01:56:39.963 --> 01:56:41.755
But you can save the boy?

01:56:48.422 --> 01:56:50.547
What blood group is Marc?

01:56:53.505 --> 01:56:54.547
O negative.

01:56:57.963 --> 01:56:59.172
O negative.

01:57:09.755 --> 01:57:11.505
I'm going to find him a donor.

01:57:12.172 --> 01:57:13.380
How?

01:57:14.505 --> 01:57:16.088
Who are you going to find?

01:57:17.755 --> 01:57:20.047
I did it once for her.
Grandpa!

01:57:21.255 --> 01:57:22.547
Now I'll do it for him.

01:57:26.547 --> 01:57:27.755
Rebeca.

01:57:32.588 --> 01:57:35.172
I love you more than anything
in the world.

01:59:20.797 --> 01:59:21.797
"Yes."

01:59:21.963 --> 01:59:23.255
<i>Transplants save many lives.</i>

01:59:23.422 --> 01:59:24.672
"Transplants save many lives."

01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:25.922
<i>Yours being one of them.</i>

01:59:26.047 --> 01:59:27.755
"Yours being one of them."

01:59:28.088 --> 01:59:29.963
<i>I did it once for her.</i>

01:59:30.255 --> 01:59:31.755
<i>Now I'll do it for him.</i>

01:59:38.922 --> 01:59:43.880
<i>The music reflects the sentiment
emanating from the brotherhood,</i>

01:59:44.297 --> 01:59:47.838
<i>as it speaks of death,
but also peace.</i>

01:59:48.255 --> 01:59:49.255
Hello?

01:59:49.547 --> 01:59:52.463
<i>- Is this Olmo Mendoza's father?</i>
- Yes.

01:59:53.838 --> 01:59:54.547
<i>Our Lady of Solitude,</i>

01:59:54.630 --> 01:59:56.963
<i>although wearing the mourning veil,
looks dazzling.</i>

01:59:57.130 --> 01:59:59.213
<i>She walks to the sound of her march.</i>

02:00:24.713 --> 02:00:27.588
<i>...as it speaks of death,
but also peace.</i>

02:00:42.838 --> 02:00:43.880
<i>Our Lady of Solitude,</i>

02:00:43.963 --> 02:00:46.130
<i>although wearing the mourning veil,
looks dazzling.</i>

02:00:46.213 --> 02:00:48.005
<i>She walks to the sound of her march.</i>

02:01:36.463 --> 02:01:37.838
Rebeca.

02:01:39.463 --> 02:01:41.463
You're on the right lines.

02:01:43.380 --> 02:01:46.005
With them, think the worst
and you'll be right.

02:01:57.922 --> 02:02:00.172
"Think the worst
and you'll be right."

02:02:05.172 --> 02:02:06.255
Amaia.

02:02:07.422 --> 02:02:08.588
Amaia.

02:02:09.672 --> 02:02:12.255
Víctor and Olmo killed that baby,
didn't they?

02:02:14.255 --> 02:02:18.255
Please, tell me.
Which one did it?

02:02:21.630 --> 02:02:23.672
Nobody knows who did what.

02:02:24.963 --> 02:02:28.963
But yes, between them,
they killed that boy.

02:02:30.713 --> 02:02:34.338
So that was the last job
they did for their father?

02:02:42.672 --> 02:02:43.713
Yes.

02:02:48.005 --> 02:02:49.380
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

02:02:49.588 --> 02:02:52.713
I have nothing else

02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:55.047
to add to this story.

02:02:56.505 --> 02:02:59.047
I'M SORRY, I HAVE NOTHING ELSE
TO ADD TO THIS STORY.

02:03:37.130 --> 02:03:40.588
It's number 21,
one of the best villas in Denia.

02:03:43.505 --> 02:03:44.713
I'm going.

02:04:15.172 --> 02:04:16.838
You're an early bird.

02:04:39.922 --> 02:04:43.588
What was tattooed on your shoulder?
An eagle?

02:04:44.672 --> 02:04:46.338
I don't even remember.

02:04:47.755 --> 02:04:49.880
You covered it
after you met my mother.

02:04:50.797 --> 02:04:52.213
I was a fan of La Maca.

02:04:52.380 --> 02:04:53.463
Right.

02:04:55.922 --> 02:04:58.213
And one day
you just happened to run into her.

02:04:59.255 --> 02:05:02.797
I was in my pram.
Just recovering from my operation.

02:05:03.255 --> 02:05:06.255
And with just a glance,
you both found what you needed

02:05:06.422 --> 02:05:08.172
and started living together.

02:05:10.797 --> 02:05:12.255
That's what you always told me.

02:05:14.088 --> 02:05:15.963
Was it really by chance?

02:05:18.130 --> 02:05:19.797
Were you really a fan of La Maca?

02:05:22.922 --> 02:05:25.922
No. I became one.

02:05:26.380 --> 02:05:30.963
I started listening to her music,
while I changed your nappies.

02:05:40.130 --> 02:05:41.630
And my grandpa?

02:05:42.630 --> 02:05:45.297
How did my grandpa allow

02:05:45.588 --> 02:05:48.255
you of all people
to live with my mum?

02:05:56.588 --> 02:05:58.588
He never knew who did the job.

02:06:00.755 --> 02:06:02.380
He paid not to know.

02:06:10.630 --> 02:06:14.463
He must have paid a lot,
because no one in the family knew.

02:06:19.213 --> 02:06:20.922
Until Julieta...

02:06:21.880 --> 02:06:24.047
Your mother told mine.

02:06:30.963 --> 02:06:32.380
How could you

02:06:32.588 --> 02:06:35.838
live with Mum and me
after what you did?

02:06:42.463 --> 02:06:44.463
That boy gave you his life.

02:06:46.422 --> 02:06:49.588
I wanted to nurture it,
through you.

02:06:51.838 --> 02:06:53.713
Because you felt remorse?

02:06:54.172 --> 02:06:56.588
But soon I loved you
like a daughter.

02:06:58.713 --> 02:06:59.963
I felt like a father.

02:07:03.838 --> 02:07:06.088
Then I fell in love
with your mother.

02:07:10.630 --> 02:07:13.505
What I still don't know is who...

02:07:14.005 --> 02:07:16.172
which of the two brothers
killed the boy.

02:07:22.713 --> 02:07:23.713
I did it.

02:07:37.838 --> 02:07:39.172
Well, thank you,

02:07:40.422 --> 02:07:41.505
Dad,

02:07:42.963 --> 02:07:45.172
for looking after me
since I was a baby.

02:08:50.338 --> 02:08:51.422
Hello.

02:08:51.880 --> 02:08:52.880
Marc.

02:08:53.255 --> 02:08:54.255
Hello.

02:10:12.963 --> 02:10:19.755
TO MY MOTHER
