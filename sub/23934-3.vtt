00:09.284 --> 00:10.995
Deb Fletcher, Chief of Station.

00:10.996 --> 00:12.749
Hi.

00:12.750 --> 00:14.795
You come find me
when you're done.

00:14.796 --> 00:16.297
I'm one floor up.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.074

00:29.157 --> 00:31.119
Less than 36 hours ago,

00:31.120 --> 00:32.998
some number of Americans

00:32.999 --> 00:35.587
and scores of Kenyans
were murdered.

00:35.588 --> 00:37.089
Has there been any word on

00:37.090 --> 00:39.343
an American woman,
Deborah Fletcher?

00:39.344 --> 00:41.682
Our estimates give us
a 75, 80% chance

00:41.683 --> 00:44.186
of killing UBL
if we wipe out all the targets.

00:44.187 --> 00:46.441
How much collateral damage
are we talking about?

00:46.442 --> 00:49.071
Find him, arrest him,
put him on trial, then in jail.

00:49.072 --> 00:51.034
Treat him like a criminal,
not a hero.

00:51.035 --> 00:52.871
The day before,

00:52.872 --> 00:55.585
an Arab man walked up
to the guard house.

00:55.586 --> 00:58.674
He wanted to know
how I operated the metal bar.

00:58.675 --> 01:00.678
I believe he lives
up in Manchester.

01:00.679 --> 01:02.139
All right,
I'm coming to England.

01:02.140 --> 01:03.517
Ali, Barry, I'll see you

01:03.518 --> 01:04.686
tomorrow morning in Manchester.

01:04.687 --> 01:06.314
The President agreed today

01:06.315 --> 01:07.859
to testify
in the Monica Lewinsky case.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.613
The White House
will be desperate

01:09.614 --> 01:11.282
to turn people's attention
away from the story.

01:11.283 --> 01:12.869
We're gonna finally get Clinton

01:12.870 --> 01:14.748
to pull the fucking trigger
on alQaeda.

03:17.076 --> 03:19.998
After the embassy bombings
in East Africa,

03:19.999 --> 03:22.377
the United States engaged in

03:22.378 --> 03:25.676
two retaliatory strikes,
did it not?

03:25.677 --> 03:27.513
I'm sorry,
was that not rhetorical?

03:27.514 --> 03:29.893
No, we ask real questions here.

03:29.894 --> 03:32.481
Yes. Let the records show

03:32.482 --> 03:34.026
actually, I believe
it already does

03:34.027 --> 03:36.447
that there were
two retaliatory strikes.

03:36.448 --> 03:38.577
Thank you. And how much
thought went into

03:38.578 --> 03:40.706
the American military response?
How much thought?

03:40.707 --> 03:42.292
I don't understand the question.

03:42.293 --> 03:45.048
How much thought?
The American government

03:45.049 --> 03:48.179
had two paths open,
following the embassy bombings.

03:48.180 --> 03:49.891
We could've treated
the bombings as crimes,

03:49.892 --> 03:52.772
and used the FBI
to hunt down the criminals,

03:52.773 --> 03:54.734
and prosecute them
under American law.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.072
The other option was to treat
the hostile individuals.

03:57.073 --> 03:58.617
Hostile is perhaps
an understatement.

03:58.618 --> 04:00.412
As we would treat
a hostile nation,

04:00.413 --> 04:02.583
and respond to their bombings
with bombs of our own.

04:02.584 --> 04:04.336
We chose the second path

04:04.337 --> 04:06.884
with Operation Infinite Reach,
did we not?

04:10.224 --> 04:13.354
Surely rhetorical.
So, what I am asking is,

04:13.355 --> 04:15.651
how much thought
went into the decision

04:15.652 --> 04:17.988
to treat the bombings
of the embassies

04:17.990 --> 04:20.619
as though they were
an act of war?

04:20.620 --> 04:23.584
Well,
what do you think qualifies

04:23.585 --> 04:26.131
as an act of war?

05:26.544 --> 05:28.672
We go forward now.

05:28.673 --> 05:30.091
You should all know
that our teams

05:30.092 --> 05:32.387
are on the ground in Africa.

05:32.388 --> 05:34.767
We will do whatever we can

05:34.768 --> 05:37.691
to bring the murderers
to justice.

05:41.364 --> 05:44.244
There has never been a time

05:44.245 --> 05:46.457
in human history
when we have been free of

05:46.458 --> 05:49.631
the organized forces
of destruction.

05:49.632 --> 05:51.760
And the more open
the world becomes,

05:51.761 --> 05:54.682
the more vulnerable
people become

05:54.683 --> 05:56.978
to those who are organized

05:56.979 --> 05:59.316
and have weapons, technology,

05:59.317 --> 06:00.946
and the ability to move.

06:03.450 --> 06:05.370
Hey, how are you?

06:05.371 --> 06:07.040
Good. How are you?

06:07.041 --> 06:08.836
I'm fine.

06:10.632 --> 06:13.261
What was that? What?

06:13.262 --> 06:15.139
Was that a zip?

06:15.140 --> 06:17.269
Yes, my boot,

06:17.270 --> 06:19.566
it has a zip.

06:19.567 --> 06:22.071
Going out? Yeah.

06:24.033 --> 06:26.453
Where are you?

06:26.454 --> 06:28.917
II can't tell you.

06:28.918 --> 06:32.508
Is it nice? Is it warm?

06:32.509 --> 06:35.723
I, I can't tell you.

06:35.724 --> 06:37.602
You can't tell me if it's warm?

06:37.603 --> 06:39.229
Yeah, and you can't ask me

06:39.230 --> 06:41.109
to tell you things
I shouldn't tell you.

06:42.278 --> 06:44.114
Okay.

06:44.115 --> 06:46.621
I won't ask you
if it's warm again.

06:48.708 --> 06:50.836
Um.

06:50.837 --> 06:54.260
Listen very, very closely.

07:02.778 --> 07:05.532
Is that rain?

07:05.533 --> 07:09.540
Okay, so where
does it rain in August?

07:09.541 --> 07:12.462
Brazil? So I've heard.

07:12.463 --> 07:15.176
Okay so not Brazil.

07:15.177 --> 07:17.013
Well, that's about
half of South America,

07:17.014 --> 07:20.478
which is one of six
inhabitable continents, so

07:20.479 --> 07:24.487
I've narrowed it down to
about 92% of the world.

07:27.410 --> 07:30.039
Where's Waldo?

07:30.040 --> 07:32.377
And when is he coming back?

07:32.378 --> 07:34.882
I don't know for sure.

07:34.883 --> 07:36.761
What's happening over there?

07:36.762 --> 07:38.682
No, I do not want this
all to be onesided.

07:38.683 --> 07:40.309
I'll tell you something
if you tell me one thing,

07:40.310 --> 07:42.230
one actual thing.

07:43.735 --> 07:45.904
I can't tell you this.
It's too cheesy.

07:45.905 --> 07:47.743
How can a thing be too cheesy?

07:50.372 --> 07:52.250
Your eyes are blue,

07:52.251 --> 07:55.842
and just around the pupil,
turquoise.

08:02.731 --> 08:04.525
Look

08:04.526 --> 08:06.613
I gotta go.

08:06.614 --> 08:09.952
I'll call you soon, yeah?
I look forward to it.

08:09.953 --> 08:11.582
Okay.

08:36.089 --> 08:37.758
Transport's leaving
at 11:00 tonight,

08:37.759 --> 08:39.554
and you're on it,
taking all of this with you,

08:39.554 --> 08:43.143
so everything here
needs to be bagged and tagged.

08:43.144 --> 08:46.108
You're the engineer.

08:46.109 --> 08:47.862
I have the blueprints. Great.

08:47.863 --> 08:50.951
Chuck! You need Chuck.
He's running forensics.

08:50.952 --> 08:52.621
Toyota sent their best man.

08:52.622 --> 08:54.416
Chuck Esposito.
We talked on the phone.

08:54.417 --> 08:55.836
What's up? I got a tip

08:55.837 --> 08:58.007
I want you to check out.
Come here.

08:58.008 --> 08:59.969
Guy calls in, anonymous.

08:59.970 --> 09:01.806
Said someone's
staying in a hotel

09:01.807 --> 09:03.350
over in the Somali quarter,
and they don't fit in.

09:03.351 --> 09:05.271
They don't fit in?
What's that mean?

09:05.272 --> 09:07.108
Got no clue.
Why don't you check it out?

09:07.109 --> 09:08.945
They didn't ask for some
specifics or something?

09:08.946 --> 09:11.158
Hey, we follow every
fucking lead, big or small.

09:11.159 --> 09:12.661
If there's other business

09:12.662 --> 09:14.414
you banana heads
would rather be doing,

09:14.415 --> 09:15.876
I can take this elsewhere.
No, no, wewe got it.

09:15.877 --> 09:17.463
Thank you.

09:20.427 --> 09:22.221
The general
feeling among my people

09:22.222 --> 09:23.892
is that an appropriate
military response

09:23.893 --> 09:25.353
means two for two.

09:25.354 --> 09:26.981
They hit two of our targets,

09:26.982 --> 09:29.528
so we get to hit them
where it hurts the most.

09:29.529 --> 09:31.658
Twice. And this is?

09:31.659 --> 09:33.828
A tannery, sir. A what?

09:33.829 --> 09:35.874
It's a tannery.
It's in the Sudan.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.586
Look, Bin Laden owns it.
We take it out,

09:37.587 --> 09:39.590
we're taking out
one of his income streams.

09:39.591 --> 09:41.678
Half the fighters in alQaeda
are doing it for the money.

09:41.679 --> 09:43.640
We have to disrupt
that cash flow.

09:43.641 --> 09:45.894
And the other target?

09:45.895 --> 09:47.815
One of the training camps.

09:47.816 --> 09:49.694
Is Bin Laden going to be there?

09:49.695 --> 09:51.614
Our intelligence confirms
he's often there.

09:51.615 --> 09:53.535
Will he be there
when the missiles strike?

09:53.536 --> 09:55.747
I can't make that promise.

09:55.748 --> 09:57.584
Solution is to hit
all the camps,

09:57.585 --> 10:00.716
but you don't wanna do that.

10:00.717 --> 10:03.262
Fine with the camp, not with.

10:03.263 --> 10:05.308
Tannery, sir,
where you make leather.

10:05.309 --> 10:08.355
We've got to hit him
financially.

10:08.356 --> 10:10.819
Are you seriously
telling me a tannery?

10:10.820 --> 10:12.948
A fucking tannery
is a significant source

10:12.949 --> 10:15.244
of funding for alQaeda?

10:15.245 --> 10:18.417
I know you're in a rush, boys,
but do your fucking homework.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.922
So you'll prep the President
on the twofortwo strategy?

10:20.923 --> 10:23.928
I don't prep the President,
I advise him,

10:23.929 --> 10:25.682
and I can tell you right now,

10:25.683 --> 10:27.519
he's not gonna like it.
Well, that's good, sir.

10:27.520 --> 10:29.230
No one should like going to war.

10:29.231 --> 10:30.859
He starts throwing bombs,
and the press will say

10:30.860 --> 10:32.946
he's spilling blood
to distract everyone

10:32.947 --> 10:35.284
from Monica Lewinsky.

10:35.285 --> 10:37.664
That's what they'll say.

10:37.665 --> 10:39.668
Dick, advise the President

10:39.669 --> 10:41.506
that some of us aren't
into it for the politics.

10:41.507 --> 10:43.385
We're into it for America.

10:45.556 --> 10:48.268
I won't be passing that on,
but thank you.

10:48.269 --> 10:50.857
We have been attacked.
This is combat.

10:50.858 --> 10:52.528
Clinton needs to nut up,
do his job,

10:52.529 --> 10:55.157
and prioritize national security

10:55.158 --> 10:56.368
over what the bobbleheads
are saying

10:56.369 --> 10:57.746
on the nightly fucking news.

10:57.747 --> 11:00.085
Is that not correct, Dick?

11:04.970 --> 11:07.181
Find me another target.

11:07.182 --> 11:09.979
AILiby has just
got back from Nairobi.

11:09.980 --> 11:11.859
He's alQaeda.
We can assume he's dangerous.

11:15.031 --> 11:17.076
Feel safe now?

11:17.077 --> 11:20.249
Your toys didn't get broken
on the drive over or anything?

11:20.250 --> 11:22.295
Now, if this guy today
pulls a weapon on you,

11:22.296 --> 11:24.466
and I'm somewhere else
Like where?

11:24.467 --> 11:26.721
Like chasing his accomplice.
I see.

11:26.722 --> 11:28.766
You're getting chased,
just like in the films?

11:28.767 --> 11:30.854
I'm chasing one guy,
you're talking to another,

11:30.855 --> 11:32.356
he pulls a gun,
what would you do?

11:32.357 --> 11:35.279
Pull your weapon,
and I'll show ya.

11:35.280 --> 11:38.368
How about not playing with
guns in this very small car?

11:38.369 --> 11:40.456
Your friend is no fun. He's fun.

11:40.457 --> 11:42.169
He's fun..

11:43.923 --> 11:45.217
Shall we?

11:51.688 --> 11:53.775
When did he get back from Kenya?

11:53.776 --> 11:55.571
A few days ago.

12:06.384 --> 12:09.097
Can I help ya? How are ya?

12:09.098 --> 12:12.019
I'm Chief Superintendent James
from Scotland Yard.

12:12.020 --> 12:14.440
These two gentlemen
are from the FBI.

12:14.441 --> 12:16.612
You're joking with me.

12:16.613 --> 12:18.533
No, ma'am.

12:18.534 --> 12:20.328
You're from America.

12:21.873 --> 12:23.626
Now, what are you doing
in Manchester?

12:23.627 --> 12:25.462
We're looking for a guy.

12:25.463 --> 12:27.676
Are you?

12:27.677 --> 12:30.055
Called Anas alLiby.

12:30.056 --> 12:32.894
Yes. Well, he lives here.

12:32.895 --> 12:36.026
Fantastic. We need to have
a little chat with him.

12:36.027 --> 12:37.738
Yeah, okay then.

12:37.739 --> 12:39.826
Come in. Wipe your feet.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.655
Mostly Somalis around here?

12:58.656 --> 13:01.620
A lot of refugees,
from the civil war.

13:09.719 --> 13:12.264
This it?

13:12.265 --> 13:14.435
Let me go in first,

13:14.436 --> 13:16.064
see what they know.

13:16.065 --> 13:19.822
They may not cooperate
with Americans.

13:19.823 --> 13:21.409
Black Hawk Down.

13:38.443 --> 13:42.116
No, no, no, no, no.

13:42.117 --> 13:44.078
Wrong hotel.

13:44.079 --> 13:45.707
Wrong hotel.

13:45.708 --> 13:47.627
Down the street.
Down the street.

13:54.391 --> 13:57.856
What did he say?

13:57.857 --> 14:00.613
He said it's the wrong hotel.

14:04.036 --> 14:07.166
I rent that place
as a guest house.

14:07.167 --> 14:10.632
Anas has been
staying there awhile.

14:10.633 --> 14:12.219
Thanks very much.

14:26.873 --> 14:28.458
Come in.

14:28.459 --> 14:30.755
You are welcome.

14:30.756 --> 14:33.469
Thanks a bunch.
Don't mind if I do.

14:46.412 --> 14:48.291
I have nothing to hide.

14:55.764 --> 14:58.310
You were just in Kenya.

14:58.311 --> 14:59.647
Weren't ya?

15:01.400 --> 15:04.447
Bring back any souvenirs
or anything?

15:04.448 --> 15:06.451
My niece was there, backpacking.

15:06.452 --> 15:09.373
She brought back an insanely
large wooden giraffe,

15:09.374 --> 15:11.210
practically life size.

15:11.211 --> 15:13.549
Can't believe they let her
on the plane with it.

15:13.550 --> 15:15.638
Get yourself anything like that?

15:18.309 --> 15:20.355
I assume you have a warrant?

15:24.697 --> 15:26.576
See for yourself.

15:30.626 --> 15:32.671
Turn on that computer.

15:32.672 --> 15:34.091
It's on.

15:44.069 --> 15:45.655
He wiped it.

15:53.045 --> 15:54.965
He said,
"Winds don't always blow

15:54.966 --> 15:58.013
in the direction
that ships desire."

15:58.014 --> 15:59.683
What'd you say?

15:59.684 --> 16:02.397
I said, "Shut the fuck up."

16:16.467 --> 16:17.803
Quickly.

16:20.016 --> 16:22.145
Come on, move. Move!

16:24.942 --> 16:27.947
Stop!

16:52.957 --> 16:54.709
Back the fuck up!

16:54.710 --> 16:58.551
Stay back!

16:58.552 --> 17:02.349
Stay back! I said stay back!

17:02.350 --> 17:05.105
Stay back!

17:05.106 --> 17:07.528
Get in, get in, get in,
get in, get in.

17:41.512 --> 17:44.141
He was very polite.

17:44.142 --> 17:45.770
Very proper.

17:45.771 --> 17:47.899
Almost never came in the house.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.362
One time, he did,
'cause there were a leak,

17:50.363 --> 17:52.407
and I had the builder
out there, getting it fixed.

17:52.408 --> 17:54.621
So I said to Anas,
"Don't be daft.

17:54.622 --> 17:57.251
"Just come inside
while Roy's working.

17:57.252 --> 18:01.008
Sit in kitchen,
keep me company."

18:01.009 --> 18:03.179
And I offered him a sausage,

18:03.180 --> 18:04.724
and it were pork,

18:04.725 --> 18:07.437
and I didn't know
they didn't eat pork.

18:07.438 --> 18:09.609
I thought
that was just Jewish people,

18:09.610 --> 18:12.615
so I thought I'd got confused,
and that he were Jewish,

18:12.616 --> 18:15.746
and he said he weren't, and.

18:15.747 --> 18:18.837
We laughed a little bit.

18:20.757 --> 18:23.136
He were dead quiet,

18:23.137 --> 18:25.390
very clean.

18:25.391 --> 18:27.646
Always paid his rent on time.

18:31.236 --> 18:33.364
John, we've got nothing on him.

18:33.365 --> 18:35.160
Of course we have.
That's how we got a warrant.

18:35.161 --> 18:37.039
The search is
turning up nothing.

18:37.040 --> 18:38.834
His landlady's got nothing but
nice things to say about him.

18:38.835 --> 18:40.671
There's nothing on his computer.

18:40.672 --> 18:42.215
'Cause he wiped it.
That's evidence right there.

18:42.216 --> 18:43.761
It is not. Our fucking informant

18:43.762 --> 18:45.430
in the States
ID'd him as alQaeda.

18:45.431 --> 18:47.476
He just got back from Nairobi
by way of Dubai.

18:47.477 --> 18:49.063
He said he went for a wedding.

18:49.064 --> 18:50.524
And the night I met my wife,

18:50.525 --> 18:52.194
I told her I owned
a beach house.

18:52.195 --> 18:54.741
There is overwhelming
circumstantial evidence.

18:54.742 --> 18:56.410
Figure out a charge!
Listen to me,

18:56.411 --> 18:57.830
there are laws in this country,

18:57.831 --> 18:59.584
and I believe in yours too, yes?

18:59.585 --> 19:01.295
Laws about not detaining people
without evidence.

19:01.296 --> 19:03.216
And sometimes, it's frustrating.

19:03.217 --> 19:04.886
Barry, don't talk to me
like I'm fucking two years old.

19:04.887 --> 19:06.263
And I'm not about to
start breaking rules

19:06.264 --> 19:07.975
and making things up

19:07.976 --> 19:09.646
because you're not
getting what you want,

19:09.647 --> 19:11.817
because that's how
the system falls apart.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.865
Now, be you never so high,
the law is above you.

19:16.828 --> 19:18.873
The fuck is that?
A fridge magnet?

19:33.945 --> 19:36.616
No, no, no, don't answer it.

19:36.617 --> 19:38.745
No.

19:38.746 --> 19:40.916
What do you need, boss?
I need that hard drive

19:40.917 --> 19:43.337
the sisters picked up
last month from Azerbaijan.

19:43.338 --> 19:45.008
Yeah I want you to run.

19:45.009 --> 19:47.012
Anas alLiby.

19:47.013 --> 19:49.349
Don't write it down.
Anas alLiby.

19:49.350 --> 19:52.607
What is wrong with you?
Hey, listen,

19:52.608 --> 19:54.611
they've got that vault
walled off for me.

19:54.612 --> 19:56.197
Well, I need you
to figure it out, okay?

19:56.198 --> 19:58.159
He walks
unless you find something.

19:58.160 --> 20:00.998
Okay, boss.

20:00.999 --> 20:02.752
Those motherfuckers
really don't get

20:02.753 --> 20:04.380
that we're all on
the same team, do they?

21:09.720 --> 21:11.264
How are you, Martin?

21:13.268 --> 21:15.147
Catch those Redskins tonight?

21:16.817 --> 21:18.737
You're not supposed
to be in here.

21:18.738 --> 21:20.365
No one told me that.

21:20.366 --> 21:22.328
I mean, the door isn't locked.

21:25.376 --> 21:27.128
What are you doing?

21:27.129 --> 21:30.343
Couldn't sleep.
Figured I may as well work.

21:30.344 --> 21:32.263
Fucking Amy's fucking snoring.

21:32.264 --> 21:33.934
It's distracting.

21:33.935 --> 21:37.191
Figured I'd work in here.
Is that not okay?

21:38.695 --> 21:41.073
Fine, it's not okay.

21:41.074 --> 21:43.160
It's not a big deal.

21:43.161 --> 21:44.832
Hey, Vincent.

21:47.044 --> 21:49.005
I know you need O'Neill

21:49.006 --> 21:52.303
to hold you close
and call you sonny boy

21:52.304 --> 21:54.099
to make up for
how Pops went away

21:54.100 --> 21:56.730
to Atlantic City one weekend
and never came back,

21:56.731 --> 21:59.861
but if you think that
you can walk into my house

21:59.862 --> 22:01.363
and steal my information

22:01.364 --> 22:03.159
and walk it over
to the other side,

22:03.160 --> 22:05.037
then you really do have the IQ

22:05.038 --> 22:07.292
of aof a baby.

22:07.293 --> 22:10.047
You're a paranoid man.

22:10.048 --> 22:12.511
That's okay. I get it.

22:12.512 --> 22:14.932
Means you're the right man
for the job.

22:14.933 --> 22:16.519
You know what
the technical term is

22:16.520 --> 22:19.357
for stealing our shit
without asking?

22:19.358 --> 22:21.487
Rude.

22:21.488 --> 22:22.699
Treason.

22:24.452 --> 22:26.664
You don't know
what's on that hard drive.

22:26.665 --> 22:29.419
You don't know how many
people might be in danger

22:29.420 --> 22:31.508
by being privy to information

22:31.509 --> 22:34.012
that you, specifically you,

22:34.013 --> 22:36.058
are not cleared for.

22:36.059 --> 22:38.312
And if that hard drive
leaves this room,

22:38.313 --> 22:40.233
you leave this building.

22:40.234 --> 22:42.111
And I wouldn't be surprised
if you aren't allowed back

22:42.112 --> 22:44.826
into any government building

22:44.827 --> 22:46.371
ever.

22:48.124 --> 22:50.003
Except maybe prison.

23:22.109 --> 23:24.321
You know they're winning, right?

23:24.322 --> 23:26.408
And you know
that's not beer, right?

23:26.409 --> 23:29.749
It's water mixed with a little
bit of Mr. Budweiser's piss.

23:29.750 --> 23:31.293
This is exactly what I'm saying.

23:31.294 --> 23:33.130
You're not taking
the situation seriously.

23:33.131 --> 23:36.136
There's a time to work,
and there's a time to play.

23:36.137 --> 23:37.932
You have to make sure
your superiors.

23:37.933 --> 23:39.936
My what now?
Your superiors understand

23:39.937 --> 23:43.108
how organized these guys are,
how passionate.

23:43.109 --> 23:44.987
They're serious, they're monied,

23:44.988 --> 23:46.574
and they're international.
Yeah, listen to the man,

23:46.575 --> 23:48.118
for he knows of what he speaks.

23:48.119 --> 23:49.479
You will remember him
as a prophet.

23:54.298 --> 23:56.970
You guys should be setting up
a dedicated task force

23:56.971 --> 23:58.723
like we have
in the States, okay?

23:58.724 --> 24:00.978
We have a Bin Laden department.

24:00.979 --> 24:03.399
CIA, FBI, White House.
The kid's right.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.194
Talk to the Queen, make it so.

24:05.195 --> 24:07.950
Listen, Soufan,
this is not the first time.

24:07.951 --> 24:10.371
England's ever encountered
a terrorist now, is it?

24:10.372 --> 24:12.000
I don't know why you're
giving me the lecture,

24:12.001 --> 24:13.293
you arrogant little fucker.

24:15.800 --> 24:17.720
I worked IRA cases
through the 70s.

24:17.721 --> 24:19.347
Jeez. And all through the 80s,

24:19.348 --> 24:20.809
so let me explain
something to you

24:20.810 --> 24:23.063
about the nature of a battle.

24:23.064 --> 24:24.817
It's a mind game.
They want you to think

24:24.818 --> 24:26.403
that they're
an allpowerful force,

24:26.404 --> 24:27.990
that they can
they can vaporize you

24:27.991 --> 24:30.161
with their eyeballs,
but it's not that.

24:30.162 --> 24:32.666
They're a ragtag bunch of
misfits and trouble makers

24:32.667 --> 24:34.628
that can't get a girlfriend,

24:34.629 --> 24:36.591
so they're getting their dicks
hard by playing with guns.

24:36.592 --> 24:39.137
And that's all they are.

24:39.138 --> 24:40.807
And that is how you treat them.

24:40.808 --> 24:42.393
You're underestimating them.

24:42.394 --> 24:44.272
And you're feeding
their illusions.

24:44.273 --> 24:46.778
A Bin Laden unit?
Jesus Christ, you

24:46.779 --> 24:49.240
I mean, you might as well
pin a medal on the man.

24:49.241 --> 24:50.827
It took you 70 years
to beat the IRA,

24:50.828 --> 24:52.246
and that's if the peace holds.

24:52.247 --> 24:54.417
We don't have that sort of time.

24:54.418 --> 24:56.004
I swear to God,
if I was a Muslim,

24:56.005 --> 24:57.675
I'd have five wives.

25:07.946 --> 25:09.448
He dances like his mother.

25:12.412 --> 25:15.418
Not much.

25:18.676 --> 25:20.846
Are you married?

25:20.847 --> 25:22.516
No.

25:22.517 --> 25:24.687
I've been married for

25:24.688 --> 25:27.150
23 years.

25:27.151 --> 25:29.445
Find the right woman,
you can be out and about,

25:29.446 --> 25:32.118
having more fun than
you ever had in your life,

25:32.119 --> 25:34.666
and suddenly,
you'll wanna come home.

25:39.049 --> 25:42.931
That must be the worst
feeling in the world?

25:42.932 --> 25:45.020
Not wanting to go home?

26:59.001 --> 27:00.962
Hello?

27:00.963 --> 27:03.091
This is Ayman Mohammed
Rabie alZawahiri.

27:03.092 --> 27:04.928
Bad line. Say it again?

27:04.929 --> 27:07.976
This is Ayman Zawahiri.

27:07.977 --> 27:09.395
Zawahiri.

27:09.396 --> 27:12.611
Hello, doctor. How are you?

27:12.612 --> 27:15.324
This is what
I want you to print.

27:15.325 --> 27:17.078
Tell the Americans

27:17.079 --> 27:20.417
we can take on
the United States.

27:20.418 --> 27:24.593
We aren't afraid of
acts of aggression.

27:24.594 --> 27:28.518
We suffered and survived
the Soviet bombings

27:28.519 --> 27:31.481
for ten years in Afghanistan.

27:31.482 --> 27:34.947
We are ready for
more sacrifices.

27:34.948 --> 27:38.580
The war has only just begun.

27:41.711 --> 27:43.172
Everybody got that?

27:54.194 --> 27:56.156
Bin Laden just used
his satellite phone.

27:56.157 --> 27:58.578
He's at the training camp.
You wanna get him, we go now.

27:58.579 --> 27:59.914
Now.

28:01.585 --> 28:03.253
I know you want me to just

28:03.254 --> 28:05.633
push a button under my desk
and blow shit up,

28:05.634 --> 28:08.681
but no such button
was provided to me.

28:08.682 --> 28:10.727
First, I talk to your boss,

28:10.728 --> 28:13.524
then I talk to my boss,
the President,

28:13.525 --> 28:16.280
who may or may not
give the order.

28:18.075 --> 28:20.496
Tell George I'm coming over.

28:20.497 --> 28:21.833
Now.

28:28.054 --> 28:29.640
Yes, sir.

28:29.641 --> 28:32.646
Elliot, the President's
almost certainly

28:32.647 --> 28:35.151
gonna have to come back
from the Vineyard.

29:23.749 --> 29:25.918
Shave your beard, did ya?

29:25.919 --> 29:27.757
Felt like a change?

29:30.846 --> 29:32.891
So, what are you doing
in Nairobi?

29:32.892 --> 29:35.563
You're a Saudi, aren't you?

29:35.564 --> 29:37.652
How'd you hurt your hand?

29:39.614 --> 29:42.077
Looks pretty nasty.

29:44.039 --> 29:47.252
Now, that's not true.

29:47.253 --> 29:50.258
You checked into the hotel
in English.

29:50.259 --> 29:53.557
Your English is great.
You were born in England.

29:53.558 --> 29:55.853
We have friends of yours
back in the States,

29:55.854 --> 29:59.110
who have sat in rooms
very much like this one.

29:59.111 --> 30:00.864
Slightly fresher paint, maybe.

30:02.367 --> 30:04.580
They've told us all about you.

30:09.924 --> 30:11.969
I don't like this one.

30:11.970 --> 30:13.556
Think you can
get her out of here?

30:13.557 --> 30:15.016
Get out of here. But we're doing.

30:15.017 --> 30:16.895
Out!

30:21.155 --> 30:23.117
Sorry about that.

30:29.045 --> 30:30.965
Have you got a chance
to pray today?

30:30.966 --> 30:33.179
Yeah, thanks. Good.

30:42.740 --> 30:45.285
No, but thank you.

30:52.718 --> 30:55.431
So, you got the money
from the bank?

30:58.187 --> 31:01.192
And then, that same day,
you walked by the embassy

31:01.193 --> 31:03.948
when the bomb blew up.

31:03.949 --> 31:07.204
Yeah.

31:07.205 --> 31:09.124
I think it was
an accident or something.

31:09.125 --> 31:11.087
At the embassy?

31:11.088 --> 31:12.841
Maybe a gas leak.

31:12.842 --> 31:14.970
No, I doubt it.

31:14.971 --> 31:16.389
But let's not worry
about that right now.

31:16.390 --> 31:18.476
I just wanna get
my facts straight.

31:18.477 --> 31:20.773
So, you went to the bank

31:20.774 --> 31:23.152
the same day as the explosion
or a different day?

31:23.153 --> 31:24.782
Same day.

31:25.784 --> 31:28.246
You got knocked down
by the blast.

31:28.247 --> 31:30.751
You went to the hospital?

31:30.752 --> 31:32.547
And that's where you
discovered that you'd lost

31:32.548 --> 31:35.887
all your identification
documents in the explosion?

31:35.888 --> 31:37.891
Yes.

31:37.892 --> 31:41.147
And you're here exploring
business opportunities?

31:41.148 --> 31:43.736
You're a nut merchant.

31:43.737 --> 31:46.366
What kinda nuts? All of them.

31:47.745 --> 31:50.666
So, someone at the bank

31:50.667 --> 31:53.212
gave you $800,
and you're walking,

31:53.213 --> 31:55.593
boom, your ID flies away,

31:55.594 --> 31:57.179
disappears,

31:57.180 --> 31:59.517
but the money is okay.

31:59.518 --> 32:02.189
Help me understand that.

32:02.190 --> 32:04.737
The money was in my jacket.
That jacket?

32:06.741 --> 32:08.535
In here.

32:08.536 --> 32:10.623
So, right now,

32:10.624 --> 32:12.502
you're wearing
what you wore that day?

32:12.503 --> 32:14.172
Exactly.

32:22.940 --> 32:24.734
See

32:24.735 --> 32:27.197
I had a suitcase.

32:27.198 --> 32:30.120
Inside was my wallet
and my other clothes.

32:30.121 --> 32:32.457
I was going away for
for a couple days.

32:32.458 --> 32:35.088
Okay. I get it.

32:35.089 --> 32:37.969
I had a suitcase in this hand,

32:37.970 --> 32:40.641
and it was blasted away.

32:40.642 --> 32:42.562
When I woke up,

32:42.563 --> 32:43.772
it was gone.

32:43.773 --> 32:45.526
When I got up,

32:45.527 --> 32:48.322
I was in.

32:48.323 --> 32:51.287
Quite shocking.

32:51.288 --> 32:53.625
It was shocking.

32:53.626 --> 32:56.506
So many people got hurt.

32:56.507 --> 33:00.388
We're guessing there's more
than 4,000 people wounded,

33:00.389 --> 33:03.227
at least 200 people dead.

33:03.228 --> 33:06.108
Only 12 Americans,

33:06.109 --> 33:08.154
then just other people.

33:08.155 --> 33:10.283
All sorts of other people
from all over:

33:10.284 --> 33:11.870
Muslims, Christians,

33:11.871 --> 33:14.375
black, white, brown, and.

33:16.296 --> 33:19.803
Why do innocent people
have to suffer?

33:19.804 --> 33:23.268
That's a question
I ask myself all the time.

33:24.897 --> 33:27.527
I pray about it too.

33:27.528 --> 33:29.197
Why?

33:31.118 --> 33:32.663
What do you think?

33:34.249 --> 33:36.878
We don't know who's innocent.

33:36.879 --> 33:39.091
Only Allah knows.

33:39.092 --> 33:42.305
He judges, he punishes.

33:42.306 --> 33:44.561
He's in control.

33:44.562 --> 33:46.188
There's no need
for you to worry about

33:46.189 --> 33:48.317
who's innocent and who's not.

33:48.318 --> 33:51.157
Thank you for saying that,
because

33:51.158 --> 33:53.369
sometimes,

33:53.370 --> 33:55.833
you know,

33:55.834 --> 33:58.631
these last few days, I

34:00.760 --> 34:04.392
I've seen those crushed bodies.

34:05.562 --> 34:09.735
Those families grieving,

34:09.737 --> 34:11.822
and

34:11.824 --> 34:13.911
it's just horrible.

34:19.965 --> 34:22.804
You know, back in the day,
I was in the army.

34:24.389 --> 34:27.062
And I don't know what basic
training's like in the KSA,

34:27.063 --> 34:29.609
but in the States,
it's pretty intense.

34:29.610 --> 34:32.531
I mean, fun too.

34:32.532 --> 34:35.245
You make friends. Like

34:35.246 --> 34:37.248
like, I never knew

34:37.250 --> 34:40.088
what true friendship was,

34:40.089 --> 34:42.927
until I was running, climbing,

34:42.928 --> 34:47.101
shooting, shitting, praying

34:47.103 --> 34:48.605
with a bunch of 20 other guys

34:48.606 --> 34:50.275
that I never met
before in my life,

34:50.275 --> 34:53.281
and I had nothing
in common with, except

34:53.282 --> 34:55.911
we're all going on
no sleep and crap food,

34:55.911 --> 34:58.959
we hate and love our C. O.,

34:58.960 --> 35:01.338
and we are all willing
to die in the mud

35:01.339 --> 35:03.051
for what we believe in.

35:04.555 --> 35:07.475
Anyway, I was pretty good,

35:07.476 --> 35:10.356
and I wound up doing
some advanced training

35:10.357 --> 35:12.152
in counterinterrogation
techniques.

35:12.153 --> 35:14.406
You ever did that?

35:14.407 --> 35:16.619
You ever serve? Yeah, of course.

35:16.620 --> 35:19.416
Right, so you know
the whole thing, right?

35:19.417 --> 35:21.295
They beat you up, scream at you,

35:21.296 --> 35:23.090
try to get you
to answer their questions,

35:23.091 --> 35:24.552
and the whole thing is,

35:24.553 --> 35:26.765
you gotta stick to
your cover story,

35:26.766 --> 35:28.977
and if you do that, you pass,

35:28.978 --> 35:31.148
and you, sir,

35:31.149 --> 35:33.654
you did very, very well.

35:38.413 --> 35:42.420
You got a great cover story.

35:42.421 --> 35:44.635
But you made two mistakes.

35:48.893 --> 35:50.562
What mistakes?

35:50.563 --> 35:52.775
First, you got blood
all over your hands,

35:52.776 --> 35:55.279
but there's no blood
on your clothes.

35:55.280 --> 35:57.450
And you're wearing the same
clothes you wore that day?

35:57.451 --> 35:59.496
No way. No way, man.

35:59.497 --> 36:02.168
I washed my clothes
at the hotel.

36:02.169 --> 36:03.880
You see,

36:03.881 --> 36:06.803
Arab men are a lot cleaner
than American men.

36:06.804 --> 36:08.849
See, the first thing we do

36:08.850 --> 36:10.644
when we get something
on our clothes is

36:10.645 --> 36:13.315
wash it off. Okay. That's true.

36:13.316 --> 36:16.113
I know a lot of American men
that live like pigs.

36:16.114 --> 36:19.161
You ever see a fat man
eat at McDonald's?

36:19.162 --> 36:22.208
Always gets ketchup
on his shirt.

36:22.209 --> 36:23.546
Always.

36:25.048 --> 36:27.970
You did say two mistakes.

36:27.971 --> 36:30.391
Hey, look at your belt, man.

36:30.392 --> 36:32.437
It's all spiffy.

36:32.438 --> 36:35.026
It's got no dust in the creases.

36:35.027 --> 36:36.779
I'm a clean Arab man.

36:36.780 --> 36:39.243
No. Look down.

36:41.749 --> 36:45.254
It's got no creases.
It looks new.

36:45.255 --> 36:48.553
I think you fucked up.

36:48.554 --> 36:50.516
Unbuckle the belt.

36:50.517 --> 36:53.395
Excuse me?
No, no, no, it's okay.

36:53.396 --> 36:55.150
Just unbuckle the belt.

36:57.531 --> 37:01.078
Yeah, I think you fucked up
your cover story.

37:01.079 --> 37:04.417
And I'm guessing you've got
spiffy new shoes on your feet,

37:04.418 --> 37:06.589
nice new clothes on your back,

37:06.590 --> 37:09.095
brand new belt.

37:13.061 --> 37:14.689
You gotta be kidding me.

37:14.690 --> 37:17.403
You forgot to take
the price tag off.

37:20.952 --> 37:23.414
It's all right. It's okay.

37:23.415 --> 37:25.418
You're young.

37:25.419 --> 37:27.632
Rookie mistake, my friend.

37:38.613 --> 37:40.073
Write it down.

37:41.577 --> 37:43.203
Write what down Write it down!

37:43.204 --> 37:45.374
Write it down!

37:45.375 --> 37:47.337
Write down the number you called

37:47.338 --> 37:48.923
after the bomb went off!

37:48.924 --> 37:50.969
Write down the number!

37:50.970 --> 37:53.350
What is the number?

38:19.276 --> 38:22.533
Number he called
after the bombing.

38:22.534 --> 38:24.870
How did you get this?

38:24.871 --> 38:26.542
I asked.

38:37.146 --> 38:39.190
You guys checked out
this pharmaceutical plant?

38:39.191 --> 38:41.403
You read the report?

38:41.404 --> 38:43.323
I was right in the middle,

38:43.324 --> 38:45.912
when Eager Beaver burst in.

38:45.913 --> 38:49.795
Soil samples show
high concentrations of EMPTA.

38:49.796 --> 38:52.383
Only reason anybody uses that
is to make nerve gas.

38:52.384 --> 38:54.805
It's a fucking chemical
weapons factory, Dick.

38:54.806 --> 38:56.642
Now, I'm not saying
that we're lucky

38:56.643 --> 38:58.688
that they bombed the embassies,
because God bless,

38:58.689 --> 39:00.776
but it is definitely
a silver lining,

39:00.777 --> 39:03.113
in that we get to dismantle
their Khartoum operation,

39:03.114 --> 39:05.117
because as we both know,
if ever there were

39:05.118 --> 39:06.788
a chemical attack, it would
make the East Africa situation

39:06.789 --> 39:08.666
look like a fucking
walk in the park.

39:08.667 --> 39:10.419
I know.

39:10.420 --> 39:12.340
This motherfucker Bin Laden
isn't kidding around.

39:12.341 --> 39:14.970
That is correct.
That's why we have to act now.

39:14.971 --> 39:17.350
He's there right now.

39:17.351 --> 39:19.606
Have a cigar there,
Eager Beaver.

39:21.484 --> 39:24.322
We are gonna act now, right?

39:24.323 --> 39:25.826
President's traveling.

39:25.827 --> 39:27.328
We can brief him
while he's in the air.

39:27.329 --> 39:28.623
Sounds good.

39:28.624 --> 39:30.669
Let's do it.

39:30.670 --> 39:32.421
Monica Lewinsky will now testify

39:32.422 --> 39:34.342
before a Grand Jury
about the details

39:34.343 --> 39:36.931
of her alleged involvement
with President Clinton,

39:36.932 --> 39:39.310
and possible conversations
with Mr. Clinton

39:39.311 --> 39:40.981
about concealing evidence.

39:40.982 --> 39:43.110
Miss Lewinsky will break
seven months of silence

39:43.111 --> 39:45.114
as the first of two
key witnesses.

39:45.115 --> 39:48.037
The other witness, of course,
is the President himself.

39:50.877 --> 39:52.254
So they're in the air?

39:55.010 --> 39:57.054
Still spinning in their tubes

39:57.055 --> 40:00.103
on our ships in the Red
and Arabian Seas.

40:01.773 --> 40:05.697
Do you think we were right
to wait for nightfall?

40:05.698 --> 40:07.910
Obviously, a night attack
limits collateral damage.

40:07.911 --> 40:09.788
It is more tasteful.

40:09.789 --> 40:11.792
But the risk,
the considerable risk

40:11.793 --> 40:15.257
in attempting to fight a war
without real bloodshed,

40:15.258 --> 40:17.804
is that you won't strike
the definitive blow

40:17.805 --> 40:19.307
and the fight will go
on and on and on.

40:19.308 --> 40:21.646
I agree. Harder on our troops.

40:21.647 --> 40:24.275
And harder on our enemies.
I mean, which would you prefer?

40:24.276 --> 40:26.071
Death by 1,000 cuts?

40:26.072 --> 40:30.120
Or a quick, clean decapitation?

40:30.121 --> 40:32.375
Well

40:32.376 --> 40:34.462
the latter would be less painful.

40:34.463 --> 40:37.803
But with the former,

40:37.804 --> 40:40.140
I might have a chance.

40:40.141 --> 40:42.061
I could fight back.

40:42.062 --> 40:43.648
Very good.

40:43.649 --> 40:45.861
Yes, you could.

40:47.280 --> 40:49.785
There's very few women
not frightened by war.

40:49.786 --> 40:51.872
We're always at war.

40:51.873 --> 40:54.795
I learned that
on the Russia desk.

40:54.796 --> 40:56.590
Every single day

40:56.591 --> 40:58.886
is a real live battle
between our country

40:58.887 --> 41:00.932
and her many devious

41:00.933 --> 41:04.439
and far less tasteful enemies.

41:04.440 --> 41:06.902
And we all have a choice.

41:06.903 --> 41:10.034
You can pretend it isn't
happening, like my mother,

41:10.035 --> 41:11.871
and make chitchat about

41:11.872 --> 41:14.459
dog shelters and pizza toppings,

41:14.460 --> 41:17.173
or you can accept the world
as it really is,

41:17.174 --> 41:19.177
and do whatever you can

41:19.178 --> 41:22.434
to make sure your side isn't
the one that gets annihilated.

41:26.693 --> 41:28.321
Mothers.

41:36.337 --> 41:38.090
Hey, you hear about
this fucking bullshit?

41:38.091 --> 41:39.635
Your boss hear about it?

41:39.636 --> 41:40.970
Director Freeh
hears about everything.

41:40.971 --> 41:42.933
He been over here? No.

41:42.934 --> 41:44.310
Well, tell him to get his
fucking ass back over here.

41:44.311 --> 41:46.356
Director Freeh stops listening

41:46.357 --> 41:48.557
the second arrogant assholes
start raising their voices.

41:50.490 --> 41:53.161
Why wasn't I told? About?

41:53.162 --> 41:55.542
Dropping bombs while I got
agents on the ground.

41:55.543 --> 41:57.378
You have agents in Kenya.

41:57.379 --> 41:59.382
They're in hostile territory,
wearing fucking jackets

41:59.383 --> 42:02.096
with FBI stenciled
all over the back of 'em,

42:02.097 --> 42:04.643
and you just turned
the heat up to 100 degrees.

42:04.644 --> 42:06.564
As much as I appreciate
you weighing in on.

42:06.565 --> 42:09.235
White House foreign policy,
it is not your purview.

42:09.236 --> 42:11.867
It is when I got
men on the ground!

42:20.216 --> 42:22.469
Has someone warned my guys?

42:22.470 --> 42:24.683
Not yet. They need to know.

42:24.684 --> 42:26.477
We need to get
extra security over there.

42:26.478 --> 42:28.858
There's not enough security
over there as it is.

42:28.859 --> 42:31.197
No one can know about this
till it's done.

42:33.117 --> 42:34.746
Okay.

42:37.209 --> 42:39.504
You ever met
Kathy Shaughnessy's dad?

42:39.505 --> 42:41.424
Real nice guy.
He's a firefighter.

42:41.425 --> 42:43.428
Pulled more people out of
the Bronx when it was burning

42:43.429 --> 42:45.265
than almost anyone else
in the city.

42:45.266 --> 42:46.852
That right? Yeah.

42:46.853 --> 42:48.940
You get to tell him.

42:48.941 --> 42:51.027
If something
happens to her, okay,

42:51.028 --> 42:53.574
you get to say, "I'm sorry",

42:53.575 --> 42:55.704
stupid decisions were made."

43:02.425 --> 43:04.011
How was England?

43:08.312 --> 43:10.148
He slipped right through
our fingers.

43:10.149 --> 43:13.029
Trying to get these guys,
it's like

43:13.030 --> 43:15.450
chasing ghosts.

43:15.451 --> 43:17.163
We'll get them.

43:18.709 --> 43:20.878
I was gone,

43:20.879 --> 43:23.466
and you got talked into
bullshit by Tenet and Schmidt,

43:23.467 --> 43:24.928
who don't give a shit
about my people

43:24.929 --> 43:26.097
and what we're doing over there.

43:26.098 --> 43:27.892
It wasn't their call.

43:27.893 --> 43:29.813
It was the President's call.

43:29.814 --> 43:31.692
Well, here's what you
should've told the President:

43:31.693 --> 43:33.779
"Bin Laden's laid a trap,
and we're walking right in it

43:33.780 --> 43:35.157
and nibbling the cheese."

43:35.158 --> 43:37.579
He wants to go to war. John

43:37.580 --> 43:41.462
the United States military
is the United States military.

43:42.923 --> 43:45.345
This is not a war
alQaeda can win.

43:46.723 --> 43:48.309
Well

43:52.108 --> 43:53.944
I'll tell you
the first thing that'll happen

43:53.945 --> 43:58.203
after the bombs fall
and the dead get cleared away.

43:58.204 --> 44:00.959
They'll get
a ton of new recruits.

44:36.029 --> 44:38.074
You don't care what happens to

44:38.075 --> 44:40.245
the people who are targeted?

44:40.246 --> 44:41.583
That is correct.

44:43.670 --> 44:45.464
And what about those
who are clearly determined

44:45.465 --> 44:47.009
to be innocent?

44:47.010 --> 44:49.389
Mistakes are made.

44:50.642 --> 44:52.520
Mistakes are made?

44:52.521 --> 44:54.608
If you can prove that
there was not due diligence

44:54.609 --> 44:57.488
in designing the target package
and assembling the information

44:57.489 --> 44:59.659
that caused the operation
to go forward,

44:59.660 --> 45:01.997
then you have a case
against someone.

45:01.998 --> 45:04.878
If not, it's just a mistake.

45:04.879 --> 45:07.759
And if they're not Americans,

45:07.760 --> 45:09.805
I really don't care.

45:11.768 --> 45:13.478
Excuse me?

45:13.479 --> 45:16.485
I don't get paid, sir,
to be a citizen of the world.

45:17.696 --> 45:19.366
Maybe you do.

46:57.604 --> 46:59.816
Mohamed?

46:59.817 --> 47:01.571
Mohamed?

47:07.958 --> 47:09.670
Mohamed?

47:10.305 --> 47:16.817
