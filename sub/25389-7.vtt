WEBVTT

00:01.030 --> 00:03.624
CAMILA: Previously on
Queen of the South...

00:03.670 --> 00:05.399
And maybe one day,
we can get ourselves

00:05.430 --> 00:07.398
a little house on the beach,
make love all day in the sand.

00:07.440 --> 00:09.533
-How's that sound?
-As long as I'm with you.

00:09.570 --> 00:11.333
I'm on my way
to the meeting spot,

00:11.370 --> 00:12.678
but I got
a little bit of heat on me.

00:12.710 --> 00:14.507
Lose them first.
Meet us at the port.

00:14.540 --> 00:16.747
-Guero's not here yet.
-Let's go.

00:16.780 --> 00:18.600
JAMES: Arizona's carved up
by five narcos.

00:18.650 --> 00:20.345
They're called La Comisin.

00:20.380 --> 00:22.348
You got a lot of heart, girl.
Who gave you that?

00:22.390 --> 00:25.518
(speaking Spanish)

00:25.550 --> 00:27.313
Someone in La Comisin
sold us out.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.009
Taza backed me.

00:29.060 --> 00:31.028
Came across_a little _
something here In Phoenix.

00:31.060 --> 00:32.527
(gunshots)

00:32.560 --> 00:35.723
(tense music)

00:35.760 --> 00:38.297
-Where is she?
-Relax.

00:38.330 --> 00:39.661
Guero.

00:39.700 --> 00:41.236
-Oh.
-Teresa.

00:41.270 --> 00:42.737
Isabela, put the gun down.

00:42.770 --> 00:44.306
You took my father from me.

00:46.040 --> 00:47.337
Let's go.

00:47.380 --> 00:48.677
You're forbidden
from seeing Kique.

00:48.710 --> 00:50.371
That's crazy.
We're getting married.

00:50.410 --> 00:52.071
Not anymore.
The wedding's off.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.111
(gunshots)
Get down.

00:54.150 --> 00:56.038
(screams)
I got hit.

00:56.090 --> 00:58.183
Guero? Guero?
Pote, he's not breathing.

00:58.220 --> 00:59.710
Guero.
Guero!

00:59.760 --> 01:02.729
(music escalates)

01:02.760 --> 01:08.153
*

01:10.770 --> 01:13.762
(plane whirring)

01:24.310 --> 01:26.540
All right, let's see
how good those hands are.

01:27.750 --> 01:29.411
You know how good they are.

01:30.620 --> 01:34.158
Hey, flying's serious business,
Captain Mendoza.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.660
Why don't you give us
a steep left turn?

01:43.700 --> 01:45.463
60 degrees.

01:46.640 --> 01:47.789
Take it easy.

01:48.670 --> 01:51.366
Easy.
Nice.

01:51.410 --> 01:53.628
Looks like all those lessons
are starting to pay off.

01:54.880 --> 01:57.747
Okay, let's see how you do
with a simulated engine loss.

01:57.780 --> 02:00.669
(engine whirs, quiets)

02:02.450 --> 02:05.419
(soft dramatic music)

02:05.450 --> 02:11.685
*

02:11.730 --> 02:13.652
It's so quiet here.

02:15.130 --> 02:17.826
Yeah, it's quiet.
All right, come on now.

02:17.870 --> 02:20.088
Go through your
engine fail procedures.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.132
Mags on, mixture and throttle
full forward, hit the starter.

02:23.170 --> 02:25.263
Let's go.

02:25.310 --> 02:28.279
(wind whooshing)

02:28.310 --> 02:30.847
(plane buzzing)

02:30.880 --> 02:32.575
JAMES: Where is she?

02:37.450 --> 02:39.714
Maybe we could
just stay up here.

02:42.590 --> 02:45.354
JAMES: What is she doing?
She's gonna kill herself.

02:46.730 --> 02:49.198
GUERO: Teresa.

02:49.230 --> 02:50.561
Teresa, hey.

02:50.600 --> 02:52.488
MAN: Teresa,
pitch down now,

02:52.540 --> 02:54.428
or you're gonna stall out
and kill the both of us.

02:54.470 --> 02:56.802
*

02:56.840 --> 02:59.161
Do it now!

02:59.210 --> 03:02.179
(music escalates)

03:02.210 --> 03:05.407
*

03:05.450 --> 03:07.213
(sighs)

03:11.290 --> 03:14.214
(engine whirs, quiets)

03:24.300 --> 03:27.337
What happened up there?
Are you okay?

03:27.370 --> 03:28.928
Yeah, I'm okay.

03:28.970 --> 03:30.460
JAMES: You haven't
been sleeping.

03:30.510 --> 03:32.239
You sure flying was
a good idea?

03:32.280 --> 03:34.601
(phone vibrating)

03:34.640 --> 03:35.675
It's Lil T.

03:38.810 --> 03:40.209
Hey, it's me.
What's going on?

03:41.250 --> 03:43.684
We're making a delivery and
someone's trying to jack me.

03:43.720 --> 03:45.210
Hold up.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.820
(gunshots)

03:48.860 --> 03:51.420
(dramatic music)

03:51.460 --> 03:52.791
What the--
Ah, sh--

03:52.830 --> 03:59.690
*

03:59.740 --> 04:01.492
(tires squealing)

04:02.840 --> 04:05.331
Take that, pendejos.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.577
LIL T (over phone):
I think I lost them. What now?

04:07.610 --> 04:10.272
Finish the run.
Get somewhere safe.

04:10.310 --> 04:12.710
I'll call you when
the next load is ready.

04:12.750 --> 04:16.379
-Finish the run?
-We have orders to fill.

04:16.420 --> 04:18.285
Well, we knew
Pecas would attack us.

04:18.320 --> 04:20.857
This is the start.
He'll come for the winery next.

04:20.890 --> 04:22.983
We could have allies
against Pecas.

04:23.030 --> 04:25.658
-I want you to set the meeting.
JAMES: That wasn't the plan.

04:25.690 --> 04:28.420
We need to get the cash and
product and leave Phoenix now.

04:28.460 --> 04:30.496
This town is blown.

04:30.530 --> 04:32.964
We gotta go now, Teresita.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.265
If you wanna go, you can go.

04:38.710 --> 04:41.338
_ Teresa.
(engine turns over)

04:41.380 --> 04:43.803
I'll see you at the winery.

04:43.850 --> 04:46.444
Teresa.
(car rews)

04:46.480 --> 04:47.674
Get in the car.

04:48.950 --> 04:51.282
We don't make a move now,
we could lose all our product,

04:51.320 --> 04:52.787
or worse.

04:52.820 --> 04:56.358
I'm doing nothing
till Teresa says so.

04:58.030 --> 05:00.351
What are all these cars
domg here?

05:00.400 --> 05:03.722
(traditional Mexican music)

05:03.770 --> 05:07.035
(indistinct chatter)

05:07.070 --> 05:14.078
*

05:15.940 --> 05:17.476
(laughs)

05:20.550 --> 05:21.847
Okay, you can pretty much
just sit wherever.

05:21.880 --> 05:23.609
Don't sit in the
first two rows.

05:23.650 --> 05:25.413
That's where
the family is gonna be.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.714
Talk with you a minute?
Look, we've got work to do.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.819
You need to call this off
and send these people home.

05:29.860 --> 05:32.658
(scoffs)
Honey, I can't do that.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.793
Get them out of here.

05:34.830 --> 05:37.469
Teresa called and said
the wedding was a go.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.434
-Sorry.
-What do you mean she called?

05:39.470 --> 05:42.291
She's not here?
Where is she?

05:42.340 --> 05:45.730
(anticipative music)

05:45.770 --> 05:47.078
*

05:47.110 --> 05:50.648
(phone vibrating)

05:50.680 --> 05:51.999
(phone clicks)

05:55.750 --> 05:57.945
(birds chirping)

06:03.590 --> 06:05.126
TAZA: Teresa Mendoza.

06:07.430 --> 06:08.852
Give me one good reason

06:08.900 --> 06:11.619
I shouldn't deliver you
to Pecas right now.

06:11.670 --> 06:14.468
Because you need me
more than you need him.

06:16.470 --> 06:18.062
Yeah, we'll see.

06:18.110 --> 06:25.107
*

06:46.440 --> 06:48.590
Where are you going?

06:48.640 --> 06:50.130
School, or have you
cancelled that too?

06:50.170 --> 06:52.536
Isabela, you have
to be careful, please.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.969
Boaz is still out there
trying to do us harm.

06:55.010 --> 06:56.978
It's not safe for you
to see Kique any longer.

06:57.010 --> 06:58.944
You called off our wedding.

06:58.980 --> 07:00.845
_ He's not even
talking to me anymore.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.041
-Isabela--
-I'm late.

07:10.730 --> 07:14.097
(door creaks open and closed)

07:14.130 --> 07:15.154
What's wrong?

07:16.430 --> 07:17.522
Isabela.

07:18.770 --> 07:20.795
Good news.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.535
What?

07:22.570 --> 07:25.630
We've got a line
on Boaz's whereabouts.

07:25.670 --> 07:28.776
His cousin, Javier,
has him holed up in a tunnel

07:28.810 --> 07:30.072
underneath a home
In Badlraguato.

07:30.110 --> 07:31.873
I'm heading there right now.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.946
-No.
-Excuse me?

07:33.980 --> 07:37.017
No, you keep my daughter
away from Kique.

07:37.050 --> 07:39.109
Put Pecas on Teresa.

07:39.150 --> 07:42.984
If she dares
set foot in Phoenix,

07:43.030 --> 07:44.782
we'll show her who rules there.

07:44.830 --> 07:46.798
Gobernadora,
right now,

07:46.830 --> 07:49.151
Boaz is a bird in the hand.

07:49.200 --> 07:51.464
-It's a smart move--
-You have your orders.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.664
Rosario.

07:56.040 --> 07:59.168
(speaking Spanish)

08:00.180 --> 08:03.946
TAZA: This casino was
my high school, college.

08:03.980 --> 08:06.107
What went wrong?

08:06.150 --> 08:08.175
Greed got the best of us--

08:08.220 --> 08:10.688
we overbuilt and overleveraged,

08:10.720 --> 08:12.859
and ended up in the drug game,

08:12.890 --> 08:15.950
trying to outrun our debts.

08:15.990 --> 08:17.958
Sit.

08:17.990 --> 08:20.049
(soft dramatic music)

08:20.100 --> 08:22.660
IfI were a betting man,

08:22.700 --> 08:24.691
I'd bet you know
what that's like.

08:26.500 --> 08:29.492
You didn't set out
to sell cocaine.

08:29.540 --> 08:32.236
Pecas takes advantage of that.

08:32.270 --> 08:34.738
The south border
of your reservation

08:34.780 --> 08:38.238
is the entry point for
all distribution into Phoenix.

08:38.280 --> 08:40.874
You're not getting paid
what you deserve.

08:40.920 --> 08:43.081
You know that.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.884
What did you think
you were doing by coming here?

08:45.920 --> 08:48.753
You thought Taza
was the weak link?

08:48.790 --> 08:50.587
He was an underdog too.

08:50.630 --> 08:53.997
Maybe we could share fleas.

08:54.030 --> 08:55.850
No.

08:55.900 --> 08:58.869
I came here to offer you
a better deal.

08:58.900 --> 09:01.039
I'm not Pecas.

09:01.070 --> 09:03.231
We can help each other.

09:05.070 --> 09:06.935
Yeah, I'm afraid
someone with your luck

09:06.980 --> 09:09.175
wouldn't be
much help to anyone.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.747
My Bolivian product
is better than theirs.

09:13.780 --> 09:15.816
It's new to the Phoenix market.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.886
I have a better way
to distribute it.

09:19.920 --> 09:22.855
That's why
they're afraid of me.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.948
They should be
afraid of you too.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.297
When we work together,

09:28.330 --> 09:31.561
I'll give you
a cut of my product

09:31.600 --> 09:33.989
and far better terms.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.531
If you win.

09:36.570 --> 09:38.936
If you don't win,

09:38.970 --> 09:41.006
Pecas kills me...

09:41.040 --> 09:43.042
(scoffs)
And you,

09:43.080 --> 09:45.674
and anyone who
fought on your side.

09:47.150 --> 09:50.688
His greed has
lost him your loyalty.

09:52.590 --> 09:54.911
Don't you want to
protect what's yours?

09:57.260 --> 09:58.784
(clears throat)

10:01.860 --> 10:04.328
You know why people
look down on gambling?

10:05.200 --> 10:08.169
Because it holds up a mirror
to our ugliness.

10:08.200 --> 10:12.000
People hate losers
because they're pathetic.

10:12.040 --> 10:15.237
We feel guilty for
enjoying their misery.

10:16.310 --> 10:18.699
And we hate winners

10:18.750 --> 10:21.241
because they're
luckier than us.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.111
People hate luck.

10:23.150 --> 10:25.289
It's a cruel God,

10:25.320 --> 10:28.312
but it's the only real God
we have left in this country.

10:31.630 --> 10:33.325
So what do you believe in?

10:36.300 --> 10:37.858
I believe if anyone has a shot

10:37.900 --> 10:40.596
at taking on
that hungry pig, Pecas,

10:40.640 --> 10:42.631
it's you.

10:45.870 --> 10:48.839
(indistinct chatter)

10:48.880 --> 10:52.816
(mellow music playing)

10:52.850 --> 10:54.738
JAMES: We gotta find Teresa.

10:54.780 --> 10:58.386
Pecas is gonna come for us.
I need you guys to be on guard.

10:58.420 --> 11:00.854
Any cars come in
that don't look right,

11:00.890 --> 11:03.085
you know what to do.
(door slams)

11:04.990 --> 11:06.287
Last time you disappeared,

11:06.330 --> 11:08.093
you ended up
in a cell in Mexico.

11:08.130 --> 11:09.768
Now you leave
without telling us?

11:09.800 --> 11:10.960
I met with Taza.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.730
POTE: (speaking Spanish)

11:13.770 --> 11:16.295
-Why didn't you take me?
-It was better to go alone.

11:16.340 --> 11:18.661
Come on, Teresa.

11:18.710 --> 11:20.132
I did okay without you.

11:23.910 --> 11:25.343
POTE: I'll be outside.

11:28.980 --> 11:30.845
You know,
you could have been killed.

11:32.120 --> 11:34.418
I did what I had to do.

11:34.460 --> 11:36.348
I took a risk.

11:36.390 --> 11:38.051
So Taza said yes?
He's gonna side with us?

11:39.130 --> 11:41.894
Not yet, but he will,

11:41.930 --> 11:43.898
and then we're
gonna have an ally.

11:43.930 --> 11:45.227
Even if he does,

11:45.270 --> 11:46.760
we won't be strong enough
to take on Pecas

11:46.800 --> 11:48.290
and the rest of the Comisin.

11:48.340 --> 11:49.932
You know,
staying here isn't smart.

11:49.970 --> 11:52.006
It's suicidal.

11:52.040 --> 11:53.439
You've been making
some bad decisions.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.936
You know
someone's gunnIng for you,

11:54.980 --> 11:57.073
and there's a wedding
happening upstairs.

11:57.110 --> 11:59.340
Pecas won't_attack us
when there's CIVIIIans here.

12:00.850 --> 12:03.819
You're using innocent people
to protect the business?

12:03.850 --> 12:05.715
This isn't you.

12:05.750 --> 12:07.217
We said we'd do things
a different way.

12:07.260 --> 12:10.684
-This is not it. _
-You're always questioning me.

12:10.730 --> 12:11.719
Just stop.

12:15.930 --> 12:17.898
You have no obligations to me.

12:20.300 --> 12:21.836
You can leave.

12:22.840 --> 12:24.307
I'm not leaving.

12:24.340 --> 12:26.900
I'm just trying to
protect you--to protect us.

12:26.940 --> 12:29.943
With Boaz out of power,
this is Camila's territory now.

12:29.980 --> 12:32.073
I don't wanna run anymore.

12:32.110 --> 12:35.147
Camila can kill me,
but I'm not leaving.

12:35.180 --> 12:37.148
So that's what this is--
not busmess, just personal?

12:37.190 --> 12:41.149
No, this is what you do
when you've earned something.

12:41.190 --> 12:43.852
She wants war.
She can have it.

12:43.890 --> 12:46.893
(dramatic music)

12:51.930 --> 12:54.728
(traditional
Mexican music ends)

12:54.770 --> 12:56.965
(applause)

12:57.010 --> 12:59.729
PRIEST: Family and friends,

12:59.770 --> 13:04.844
we have gathered here today
to witness and celebrate

13:04.880 --> 13:08.338
the joining of
Miguel and Martha

13:08.380 --> 13:10.189
in marriage.

13:10.220 --> 13:11.517
(soft dramatic music)

13:11.550 --> 13:13.359
With love and commitment,
they have decided

13:13.390 --> 13:17.087
to live their lives together
as husband and wife.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.529
KELLY ANNE: Hey, Mama.
-Hey.

13:18.560 --> 13:21.028
PRIEST: And today,
they publicly declare

13:21.060 --> 13:23.267
their private devotion
to each other.

13:24.500 --> 13:27.367
Listen, we haven't really
gotten a chance to talk since,

13:27.400 --> 13:29.288
um...

13:31.440 --> 13:34.000
I'm so sorry about Guero.

13:36.380 --> 13:37.938
Are you okay?

13:38.910 --> 13:40.548
Yeah, I'm okay.

13:42.050 --> 13:43.347
Really?

13:43.390 --> 13:48.259
*

13:48.290 --> 13:50.952
I know how much
you loved him.

13:50.990 --> 13:53.049
I know how much
you meant to him.

13:55.360 --> 13:56.918
I mean,
I kinda know how you feel.

13:56.970 --> 13:59.564
Maybe it's not the same,
but, um,

13:59.600 --> 14:01.136
after everything happened
with Cole--

14:01.170 --> 14:03.434
You can't compare my life
to yours, Kelly Anne.

14:13.620 --> 14:16.578
Listen, I'm not trying
to patronize you.

14:16.620 --> 14:18.542
It's just, you're my friend,
and I care about you,

14:18.590 --> 14:21.286
and Ijust wanna make sure
you're okay.

14:21.320 --> 14:23.356
So, you know what?
It'll make you feel better.

14:23.390 --> 14:25.255
I'll get you a plate of
overpriced wedding food

14:25.290 --> 14:26.826
and I'll be right back, okay?

14:26.860 --> 14:28.953
MARTHA: I do.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.060
PRIEST: I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

14:32.100 --> 14:35.592
(cheers and applause)
You may kiss the bride.

14:35.640 --> 14:37.301
(phone vibrates)

14:38.910 --> 14:40.070
How can we
trust each other

14:40.110 --> 14:41.475
on this Comisin
when one of us

14:41.510 --> 14:43.239
makes moves unilaterally?

14:43.280 --> 14:44.975
By one of us, you mean me?

14:45.010 --> 14:47.240
You handed over Teresa
to Camila Vargas

14:47.280 --> 14:49.168
without consulting anyone.

14:49.220 --> 14:51.313
Camila controls the
Colombian product now.

14:51.350 --> 14:53.250
IfI don't have product,
I'm out of business.

14:53.290 --> 14:54.609
If I'm out of business,

14:54.660 --> 14:56.082
you don't get paid.

14:56.120 --> 14:58.281
It's economics, my friend.

14:58.330 --> 15:01.390
Teresa came to me and
offered me a better deal.

15:01.430 --> 15:03.261
That's also economics.

15:03.300 --> 15:06.269
But of course,
you didn't take the deal,

15:06.300 --> 15:08.188
because you are loyal
to La Comisin.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.559
TAZA:
Yes, I honor my deals.

15:09.600 --> 15:12.398
And it's time you do the same.

15:12.440 --> 15:15.204
Teresa paid for
a seat at the table.

15:15.240 --> 15:17.276
She deserves our respect.

15:17.310 --> 15:19.870
She's got superior product.

15:19.910 --> 15:21.377
Maybe if you play nice,

15:21.420 --> 15:22.944
she'll cut us all in.

15:23.920 --> 15:26.480
I'll set up a meeting
with the entire Comisin

15:26.520 --> 15:28.158
to discuss our options.

15:29.260 --> 15:31.353
Do you know where she is now?

15:32.260 --> 15:34.091
Set the meeting, Pecas,

15:34.130 --> 15:36.451
then we'll deal with Teresa.

15:36.500 --> 15:42.336
*

15:51.610 --> 15:54.579
(tense music)

15:54.620 --> 15:56.941
*

15:56.990 --> 15:57.979
(car door slams)

16:02.420 --> 16:05.127
JAMES: Pote.

16:05.160 --> 16:08.323
We gotta clear this place out.
We can't wait any longer.

16:08.360 --> 16:10.464
Teresa wants to stay.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.297
She's not thinking straight.

16:12.330 --> 16:15.390
Her calling the shots isn't
safe right now for anyone.

16:15.440 --> 16:18.238
You calling them for her now?

16:18.270 --> 16:20.670
'Cause you know
I'm not gonna let that happen.

16:20.710 --> 16:22.405
She hasn't slept
since Guero died.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.499
She's out of her mind
with grief and exhaustion.

16:24.550 --> 16:27.348
We can't let her put
her entire operation in danger.

16:27.380 --> 16:29.314
POTE: (sighs)

16:30.750 --> 16:33.389
We just need to keep her safe,

16:33.420 --> 16:34.978
get her through this,

16:35.020 --> 16:36.715
or we're all gonna pay.

16:36.760 --> 16:38.455
POTE: Mm.

16:40.530 --> 16:43.499
(traditional
Mexican music playing)

16:43.530 --> 16:50.333
*

16:50.370 --> 16:52.736
You want to leave me too?

16:52.770 --> 16:54.328
Neven

16:58.750 --> 17:00.570
You need to eat.

17:02.380 --> 17:05.588
Wedding upstairs,
you're down here alone.

17:05.620 --> 17:07.156
It's not good.

17:17.100 --> 17:20.160
-How did you handle it?
-What?

17:20.200 --> 17:22.566
When your marriage ended?

17:24.310 --> 17:25.629
Work.

17:25.670 --> 17:28.275
I put work first.

17:28.310 --> 17:31.177
My loyalty to my bosses

17:31.210 --> 17:33.644
was more than loyalty
to any woman.

17:33.680 --> 17:36.569
I vowed to protect them,

17:36.620 --> 17:39.248
no matter the Circumstances.

17:39.290 --> 17:42.612
And that's a vow
that I will never break.

17:42.660 --> 17:44.787
What you say--

17:44.830 --> 17:46.786
it goes, Teresita.

17:53.470 --> 17:55.597
Thank you.
(glasses clink)

17:55.640 --> 18:02.637
*

18:04.810 --> 18:07.142
What?

18:07.180 --> 18:09.717
James is right
about one thing though.

18:09.750 --> 18:12.241
You need to rest.

18:13.790 --> 18:15.781
I will, just...

18:17.530 --> 18:20.351
I have work to do.
I will. I promise.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.595
Just don't work too hard,

18:22.630 --> 18:26.066
and don't worry about anything.

18:26.100 --> 18:28.762
Now, eat your sandwich.

18:32.170 --> 18:33.831
WEDDING ANNOUNCER: Aww,
look at our beautiful couple

18:33.880 --> 18:35.700
dancing together.

18:35.740 --> 18:38.641
(cheers and applause)

18:42.420 --> 18:43.648
(door slams)

18:43.690 --> 18:45.681
(lock clicks)

18:45.720 --> 18:48.257
(tense music)

18:48.290 --> 18:51.782
(doorknob rattling)

18:51.830 --> 18:53.650
Pote.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.349
Pote, open the door.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.163
No, Teresa.
You need to rest.

18:57.200 --> 18:58.724
TERESA: Pote, open the door.

18:58.770 --> 19:01.568
I vowed to protect you
no matter the circumstances.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.602
Pote, don't do this!
Open the door!

19:03.640 --> 19:05.437
POTE: I will protect you
even from yourself.

19:05.470 --> 19:06.698
Pote!
Open the door.

19:06.740 --> 19:08.401
(banging)

19:08.440 --> 19:09.873
I'm sorry.

19:09.910 --> 19:12.140
Open the door, Pote!

19:12.180 --> 19:15.172
(banging)

19:15.220 --> 19:16.209
Pote!

19:21.360 --> 19:23.624
(sign creaking)

19:23.660 --> 19:25.628
Mi amor.

19:25.660 --> 19:28.629
(soft dramatic music)

19:28.660 --> 19:35.668
*

19:38.370 --> 19:39.530
(phone clicks)

19:39.570 --> 19:40.730
Bueno.

19:40.780 --> 19:41.769
General...

19:49.350 --> 19:54.913
*

19:54.960 --> 19:57.656
(door creaks open and closed)

19:58.960 --> 20:00.757
Good evening, Governor.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.428
It's Camila tonight.

20:03.470 --> 20:05.392
Have a drink.

20:09.200 --> 20:10.428
(bottle clinks)

20:12.270 --> 20:15.637
What was it you wanted
to talk to me about?

20:15.680 --> 20:17.705
It is my sad duty
to inform you that

20:17.750 --> 20:21.516
Isabela is still sneaking out
to meet with Kique Jimenez.

20:21.550 --> 20:23.279
My men confirm it.

20:25.690 --> 20:29.217
Isabela's disobedience
is putting her at risk.

20:31.490 --> 20:34.527
And Boaz can try to
use that against me.

20:34.560 --> 20:36.926
That's true,

20:36.960 --> 20:41.192
but it's a two-way street.

20:41.240 --> 20:45.267
If we were to kidnap the boy,

20:45.310 --> 20:48.609
then we can use him
to flush Boaz out from hiding

20:48.640 --> 20:50.801
and finish him for good.

20:52.580 --> 20:55.469
I am asking for the order,
Governor.

20:56.480 --> 20:59.449
(sighs)

21:02.420 --> 21:03.728
Do it.

21:03.760 --> 21:06.422
Capture him, use him--

21:06.460 --> 21:08.997
but no one can harm him
under any Circumstances.

21:09.030 --> 21:12.420
I will send my
most disciplined men.

21:12.470 --> 21:16.497
*

21:16.540 --> 21:19.634
Isabela cannot know that
it's me that gave the order.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.773
I would lose her forever.

21:23.650 --> 21:25.379
I understand.

21:31.320 --> 21:32.947
With this,

21:32.990 --> 21:36.585
we defeat Boaz for good.

21:36.620 --> 21:38.588
Up north,

21:38.630 --> 21:41.258
Pecas takes care of Teresa,

21:41.300 --> 21:44.519
and in a few
short moves of the board...

21:46.400 --> 21:49.938
Mexico is ours.

21:51.370 --> 21:52.906
Phoenix...

21:54.380 --> 21:56.439
is ours.

21:56.480 --> 22:02.578
*

22:02.620 --> 22:04.349
Together.

22:19.330 --> 22:22.094
(distant indistinct chatter)

22:33.480 --> 22:35.345
(keypad beeping)

22:35.380 --> 22:37.382
(line rings)

22:58.070 --> 22:59.606
Orale.

23:00.480 --> 23:01.777
(keypad beeps)

23:01.810 --> 23:08.477
*

23:11.790 --> 23:12.916
(car door closes)

23:17.960 --> 23:19.621
Pote!

23:21.500 --> 23:22.819
(cries)

23:25.630 --> 23:27.393
(sniffs)

23:29.940 --> 23:32.033
(sighs)

23:32.070 --> 23:34.379
(grunts)

23:34.410 --> 23:37.004
Remember, this was your idea.

23:37.040 --> 23:39.770
_ She wasn't
listening to reason.

23:39.810 --> 23:43.485
When she comes to her senses,
she'll see that we were right.

23:43.520 --> 23:45.442
That, or put a bullet in us.

23:45.490 --> 23:47.981
You don't know Mexican women.

23:49.190 --> 23:50.987
Hey, boys, you seen Teresa?

23:51.030 --> 23:52.884
Told her I'd pilfer her
a little food.

23:52.930 --> 23:54.488
She's out running an errand.

23:54.530 --> 23:56.828
Yeah, she, uh,
she left to do, uh,

23:56.860 --> 23:58.760
something.

23:58.800 --> 24:01.030
Just give me that.

24:02.600 --> 24:04.534
JAMES: (grunts)
-Okay.

24:05.610 --> 24:07.578
(bottles clanking)

24:07.610 --> 24:14.618
*

24:21.020 --> 24:22.817
We need to check the car.

24:27.900 --> 24:30.619
(doves cooing softly)

24:30.670 --> 24:37.667
*

24:45.850 --> 24:46.976
All clear.

24:48.680 --> 24:50.216
You can go.

24:53.920 --> 24:58.129
*

25:13.040 --> 25:15.873
(car approaching)

25:35.230 --> 25:37.721
GUERO:
Hey there, beautiful.

25:37.770 --> 25:39.522
(The Chamanas' "Embrujo")

25:39.570 --> 25:40.935
WOMAN:
* Es muy sorprendente

25:40.970 --> 25:43.165

You've got blood
all over your hands.

27:07.660 --> 27:10.049
Pain can be powerful.

27:10.090 --> 27:12.627
It can be our strongest weapon,

27:12.660 --> 27:16.096
but you need to use it
against your enemies,

27:16.130 --> 27:17.290
not yourself.

-Where are James and Pote?

27:46.390 --> 27:48.199
They're loading something
out back.

27:48.230 --> 27:49.822
-Did they lock you in here?
-Yeah.

27:49.860 --> 27:51.168
Whoa.
Ho, whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:51.200 --> 27:52.963
Wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:57.440 --> 27:59.362
You're not gonna make it
anywhere looking like that.

27:59.410 --> 28:01.401
And I know
you haven't been sleeping.

28:01.440 --> 28:03.305
Um,

28:03.340 --> 28:05.877
I got a little something
that might help.

28:07.150 --> 28:09.846
I mean, it's this
or a Starbucks run.

28:15.020 --> 28:17.955

28:17.990 --> 28:19.787
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

-Okay.

Yeah, uh, just up here.

They were just here.

-Give me your phone.

29:03.740 --> 29:04.900
Do you have a gun?

29:04.940 --> 29:06.362
Does it look like I have a gun?

29:06.410 --> 29:08.332
There's one in the cabinet
by the gift table.

29:08.380 --> 29:10.905
-Go get it.
KELLY ANNE: Okay.

29:11.780 --> 29:13.873
Take this last load
to the safe.

29:13.920 --> 29:16.070

Get out of here.

29:16.120 --> 29:17.883
What's up, Kelly Anne?

29:17.920 --> 29:19.114
Where are you?

29:19.150 --> 29:21.289
-Teresa.
-She got out?

29:21.320 --> 29:23.356
Someone has been killed
outside the winery.

29:23.390 --> 29:24.482
Get over here.

Listen, at this time,

TERESA (over phone): I know

Pecas just tried to kill me.

32:31.480 --> 32:33.607
You failed again.

I'm not leaving Phoenix.

what happens to my enemies,

you and Guero

of escaping,

32:47.590 --> 32:49.421

Guero is dead and
I'm sure that makes you happy,

32:52.430 --> 32:54.432
but I'm not in this
for revenge.

32:54.470 --> 32:56.665
Really?

32:56.700 --> 32:58.600
Do you feel superior,

32:58.640 --> 33:00.938
telling yourself that lie?

33:00.970 --> 33:02.676
It's the truth.

33:02.710 --> 33:06.100
But now
I will fight for what is mine.

33:06.150 --> 33:07.708
CAMILA:
I made you.

33:07.750 --> 33:09.308
I picked you up
from the streets

33:09.350 --> 33:12.183
like a stray dog.

33:12.220 --> 33:14.415
And everything you are,

33:14.460 --> 33:17.020
everything you have,

33:17.060 --> 33:20.029
everything you know
is because of me.

33:21.330 --> 33:23.218
Everything
I've learned from you

33:23.260 --> 33:26.058
was cruelty and betrayal.

33:26.100 --> 33:28.034
I've earned what I have,

33:28.070 --> 33:31.437
and I'm not gonna
let anyone take it from me.

33:31.470 --> 33:33.233

35:00.590 --> 35:02.558
We're running away

You can take my life.

35:25.220 --> 35:28.212
Women...

35:28.260 --> 35:30.512
they'll destroy you.

35:30.560 --> 35:34.428
You'll give them everything
you have inside you--

35:34.460 --> 35:37.759
your heart,
your guts, your courage,

35:37.800 --> 35:41.099
every last ounce of sacrifice
left inside of you--

35:41.130 --> 35:43.291
and they'll just walk away.

35:43.340 --> 35:47.401
They'll consume our hearts,
like our Aztec ancestors

35:47.440 --> 35:50.705
consumed the hearts
of their enemies.

35:50.740 --> 35:53.243
But...

35:53.280 --> 35:55.373
there's one thing
that can protect us--

35:55.420 --> 35:58.344
one thing that will save us,

35:58.390 --> 36:01.553
and that is our manhood.

36:02.920 --> 36:04.626
You're not a man.

You're Camila's fool.

You poor bastard.

She's playing you.

I'm the son of Boaz Jimenez.
