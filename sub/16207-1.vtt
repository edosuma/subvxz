00:48.081 --> 00:49.515
Mom?

00:49.517 --> 00:51.050
Yeah, Monkey Face?

00:51.052 --> 00:55.954
Have you, um, told the
Nebraskan family I'm gay?

00:56.689 --> 00:59.958
No. Was I supposed to?

01:01.928 --> 01:03.929
I don't know. Uh...

01:03.931 --> 01:05.998
I was kind of thinking
that while we're here...

01:06.000 --> 01:09.735
maybe we don't need to make
a real big deal about it.

01:09.836 --> 01:12.771
Hmm. So you just...
You want me to lie?

01:12.773 --> 01:14.807
No, come on. Not lie.

01:14.809 --> 01:18.877
Don, will you help me? I...
You're better with words.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.712
Well, um,

01:20.714 --> 01:23.382
you know what, it's-it's
not about you.

01:23.384 --> 01:24.349
Okay? That's fair.

01:24.351 --> 01:27.586
It's, uh... It's about Mom
and it's about Grandma.

01:27.588 --> 01:31.790
And it's about having a good
time with the Nebraska family,

01:31.792 --> 01:36.695
and let's not focus on you, okay?
Right. Okay.

01:36.830 --> 01:41.300
So, um, we should tell
the entire family...

01:41.302 --> 01:44.403
that you're not
really Jewish too.

02:27.947 --> 02:33.418
Everybody just squeeze
in just a little.

02:34.053 --> 02:35.754
There you go.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.756
Okay.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.458
Everybody look at the camera.

02:39.460 --> 02:40.792
I can't get everybody...
Squeeze.

02:40.794 --> 02:45.864
Squeeze just a... Say, "Go, Oklahoma
Sooners." Kidding. Kidding.

02:45.866 --> 02:48.867
- Ryder, come stand back here by me.
- See, I can't get...

02:48.869 --> 02:53.172
The house... The
house is cut off.

02:54.408 --> 02:55.674
You ready... ready, Don?
Yeah, Cindy.

02:55.676 --> 02:59.511
It doesn't have to be perfect, just make
sure you get everyone in the picture.

02:59.513 --> 03:03.081
Why'd you take your pants off?

03:05.919 --> 03:09.521
Um, I'm just going to move this.
Ryder. Ryder, chin up.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.925
There we go. We can
barely get everybody in.

03:13.126 --> 03:15.928
Okay, everybody say,
"Go, Cornhuskers!"

03:15.930 --> 03:18.030
Go, Cornhuskers!

03:18.032 --> 03:20.065
Louder! Go, Cornhuskers!

03:20.067 --> 03:22.034
Cornhuskers!

03:22.036 --> 03:23.402
Did it go? Not yet, Mom.

03:23.404 --> 03:26.939
The beans has to come
out of the oven.

03:26.941 --> 03:27.606
Yay!

03:27.608 --> 03:33.278
Wait, wait! One more. One
more for-for safety, guys.

03:35.281 --> 03:38.684
Come on, guys...

03:39.652 --> 03:41.853
Hey, Ryder.

03:43.456 --> 03:45.958
Come here.

03:45.960 --> 03:48.327
Aikido, huh?

03:48.962 --> 03:50.128
Push me. No, Dad,
I'm not gonna...

03:50.130 --> 03:54.633
Come on, push me. I want to
show you what happens. Push me.

03:56.169 --> 03:57.736
Whoa.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.571
You see? You see what happens?

03:59.573 --> 04:01.940
You come at me, I
redirect your energy.

04:01.942 --> 04:08.380
Hey, they can't fight you unless you
give them something to fight against.

04:08.382 --> 04:08.780
Okay?

04:08.782 --> 04:13.051
Come on, chin up, huh? Come on.
Come on. Okay.

04:13.853 --> 04:14.987
Hey.

04:14.989 --> 04:17.856
Show me your best aikido.

04:23.963 --> 04:25.864
Great, Joe.

04:27.433 --> 04:29.901
Get that one in there.

04:45.318 --> 04:47.719
Shit! Whoa.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.795
Good, Donny.

05:10.744 --> 05:13.745
Honey, give the guy
a little space now.

05:14.414 --> 05:16.381
- Ryder!
- Whoa.

05:16.383 --> 05:17.716
That looks just
like Ginger horse.

05:17.718 --> 05:21.186
She still has the picture
from last year on her wall.

05:21.188 --> 05:22.988
Abbey.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.124
Looks like you got a fan here.

05:26.126 --> 05:30.429
- Are you really from California?
- Mm-hmm.

05:30.431 --> 05:32.698
Really? Yeah.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.101
Cool.

05:38.404 --> 05:42.307
And... it is done.

05:43.543 --> 05:44.309
Yes!

05:44.311 --> 05:46.645
Sign it. There we go. Okay.

05:47.847 --> 05:51.750
Um... how-how do you
spell your name again?

05:53.487 --> 05:56.054
It's M...

05:56.056 --> 05:57.956
O...

05:57.958 --> 06:01.026
L, L...

06:01.028 --> 06:02.094
Y.

06:02.896 --> 06:06.331
I'm afraid he's gonna have his
hands full with that one.

06:06.333 --> 06:08.734
All right, now say thank you.

06:08.736 --> 06:10.135
Thank you. Come on, now.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.738
Let him do a picture for
one of your sisters.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.039
I want a mother and a baby deer.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.375
- Ask nicely, Abbey.
- Please! Please! Please! Can I have...

06:16.377 --> 06:19.044
I hope he doesn't mind a bunch
of girls hanging on him.

06:19.046 --> 06:22.247
Oh, it'll be good for him.

06:45.371 --> 06:48.306
What's up with his shorts?

06:50.376 --> 06:52.911
Is that a swimsuit?

06:54.547 --> 06:55.847
Ryder? What?

06:55.849 --> 06:58.016
Is that a swimsuit? No.

06:58.018 --> 07:00.819
Is it underwear?

07:00.821 --> 07:03.088
They're shorts.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.023
Told ya.

07:24.477 --> 07:26.278
You following us, Ryder?

07:26.280 --> 07:29.214
No.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.383
Where'd you get those glasses?

07:31.385 --> 07:35.220
Uh, the 1980s.

07:37.890 --> 07:39.825
Ryder!

07:40.159 --> 07:43.728
Yeah? Keep talking
so I can find you.

07:43.730 --> 07:48.600
Um, hi. I'm-I'm right here. Hi.

07:49.168 --> 07:50.368
Gotcha. Yeah.

07:50.370 --> 07:52.804
Can you stand up a second?

07:52.806 --> 07:53.205
Um...

07:53.207 --> 07:56.374
Ruth told me you had the shortest
pants on she'd ever seen.

07:56.376 --> 08:00.045
So I need to check
them out for myself.

08:00.346 --> 08:01.346
Oh.

08:03.317 --> 08:07.052
Oh, you have a lot of guts whipping
these out on Grandma's farm.

08:07.054 --> 08:11.656
Ryder, I'm sorry, but Molly's refusing
to let anyone tie her shoes but you.

08:11.658 --> 08:14.559
Oh. Looks like you got
your hands full here.

08:14.561 --> 08:19.498
Um, okay. I... I can tie 'em
for her if she wants me to.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.398
Yeah.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.200
Being fickle today.

08:22.202 --> 08:25.737
Can't talk reason with her.
It's cool.

08:26.839 --> 08:30.475
There we go. There's
the first one.

08:33.846 --> 08:36.280
And there we go.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.517
All right now, say thank you.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.217
Let's go to the hay mound
like you asked for.

08:40.220 --> 08:43.755
I want to go with Ryder. Let the
poor guy finish his dinner.

08:43.756 --> 08:45.790
I want to go with Ryder!

08:45.792 --> 08:48.026
Hey, Keith, I-I can take her.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.762
It's all right, Ryder. No, really.
It's okay.

08:50.764 --> 08:54.165
Here, come on, Molly, let's go.
All right.

08:55.968 --> 09:00.605
I don't want you climbing those hay bales.
Yeah, we won't.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.863
Ryder.

09:26.799 --> 09:31.202
Is it true that Uncle Don
isn't really your dad?

09:33.306 --> 09:34.539
What?

09:34.541 --> 09:38.009
No, that's weird.
Where'd you hear that?

09:38.844 --> 09:41.212
I don't know.

09:41.480 --> 09:44.449
What, did you dad tell you that?

09:50.256 --> 09:53.024
I don't think your
shorts are weird.

09:53.026 --> 09:55.193
I think they're cool.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.164
Well, thank you.

09:59.166 --> 10:04.369
Uh, I... I think
they're cool too.

10:18.751 --> 10:20.118
Ryder!

10:20.120 --> 10:21.786
Oh, hey, Molly,

10:21.788 --> 10:23.955
your dad said not
to get up on those.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.091
Where are the baby birds?

10:26.826 --> 10:32.530
Uh, do you see... see these
mud things up in the rafters?

10:32.632 --> 10:35.233
Where? It's right there.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.869
Do you see the, uh,
brown like muddy thing?

10:37.871 --> 10:41.506
- That-That's the nest right there.
- Oh, I see.

10:41.508 --> 10:43.708
How are we gonna get them?

10:43.809 --> 10:47.245
Uh, Molly, I think we should
kind of leave them alone.

10:48.147 --> 10:50.582
How about you come up here?

10:51.684 --> 10:53.318
Uh...

10:53.419 --> 10:56.221
Why... why don't we go
check out the cows?

10:56.223 --> 10:58.156
Uh...

10:58.158 --> 11:01.693
Check out the cows.

11:01.695 --> 11:05.397
I...

11:05.631 --> 11:07.966
I mean, I don't
even think the, uh,

11:07.968 --> 11:10.969
bales go high enough.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.173
We can do chicken fighting.

11:16.375 --> 11:17.409
Like...

11:17.411 --> 11:20.812
Like you getting up on my shoulders?
Yes. Chicken fighting.

11:20.814 --> 11:23.782
I don't know if that
sounds safe, Molly.

11:23.784 --> 11:26.317
I do it all the time.

11:32.391 --> 11:33.658
Okay, we'll do it,

11:33.660 --> 11:36.995
but you have to promise me that
you're not gonna fall, okay?

11:36.997 --> 11:41.299
I know. All right, wrap your
legs around my neck. Ready?

11:41.301 --> 11:46.004
I do this all the time. I bet you do.
Okay, here we go.

12:11.897 --> 12:13.565
Daddy!

12:13.567 --> 12:15.100
Molly!

12:15.102 --> 12:16.868
Daddy!

12:16.870 --> 12:19.871
Oh, my God! What happened?
Daddy!

12:19.873 --> 12:21.106
Are you hurt?

12:21.108 --> 12:23.875
- I'll take her inside.
- Ryder, are you all right?

12:23.877 --> 12:25.210
What happened to her?

12:25.212 --> 12:26.978
I-I don't know. Were you there?

12:26.980 --> 12:30.315
Yeah, I was. I... Does
this happen with her?

12:30.317 --> 12:30.882
I... What?

12:30.884 --> 12:32.617
It's okay. Just tell
us what you remember.

12:32.619 --> 12:35.653
We were just... We were up in the
barn and she started screaming.

12:35.655 --> 12:37.956
What were you doing up there?
We were just talking.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.090
Could she have cut herself? I...

12:39.092 --> 12:42.627
I mean, we were sitting on a
hay bale, so I don't think so.

12:42.629 --> 12:45.563
She was just screaming.
I... Is that all?

12:45.565 --> 12:50.602
You know what, she's gonna be fine, 'cause
Ruth is taking care of her. She's...

12:50.604 --> 12:53.304
Don't go anywhere.

12:56.208 --> 12:57.776
I...

12:57.877 --> 13:01.546
All right, why don't we all
just go sit down a second.

13:01.548 --> 13:03.081
Everything's fine.
Everything's...

13:03.083 --> 13:05.383
Uh, Molly just had
a little spill.

13:05.385 --> 13:08.353
Everything's fine. Sorry.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.822
Mom, I... Just sit over here.

13:10.824 --> 13:11.956
Don't worry. She's...

13:11.958 --> 13:16.327
Just... It's probably
a little, tiny thing.

13:22.501 --> 13:24.135
I...

13:26.472 --> 13:28.206
Um, h-how is she?

13:28.208 --> 13:29.908
She's...

13:29.910 --> 13:32.410
Are you okay? Yeah.

13:36.215 --> 13:38.316
But anyway, she's
settling down, so...

13:38.318 --> 13:40.485
We'll see if we can get
her to stop crying...

13:40.487 --> 13:42.487
long enough to tell
us what happened.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.823
Okay. Uh... Cindy, is she okay?

13:44.825 --> 13:46.624
Yeah, that's what we're
trying to figure out.

13:46.626 --> 13:49.561
Do you think maybe I should
go in and take a look at her?

13:49.563 --> 13:53.832
Um, you know what, I think
Keith's got it taken care of,

13:53.834 --> 13:56.434
but thank you.

13:56.436 --> 13:59.404
Did she stop crying? She's fine.

13:59.505 --> 14:02.307
I'm just gonna go sit with her.
Make sure doesn't need any...

14:02.309 --> 14:06.811
Ruth, I said she's fine! Now stay put!
All right.

14:10.649 --> 14:12.784
What is going on?

14:13.519 --> 14:16.120
I have no idea.

14:41.046 --> 14:44.449
You kids, why don't you all go
inside and play, all right? Okay.

14:44.451 --> 14:46.317
Go inside.

14:48.821 --> 14:52.223
Boys mind moving to another table for
a second? I want to talk to Ryder.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.692
Is Molly all right? I'm
gonna ask you again.

14:54.694 --> 14:56.728
I want you to look me in the eye...
Cindy, a little help.

14:56.730 --> 15:01.532
Tell me what happened. Keith, I would be
happy to go in and examine her and...

15:01.534 --> 15:02.300
I just did that.

15:02.302 --> 15:07.171
Well, so does she... does she have a
laceration or what did you find...

15:07.173 --> 15:08.373
No. We were sitting
on the hay bales...

15:08.375 --> 15:11.776
and she was reaching for a bird's
nest and she just started crying...

15:11.778 --> 15:15.313
Has she started her cycle yet?
That's all that happened. I...

15:15.315 --> 15:17.916
What? Has she begun
menstruating?

15:17.918 --> 15:19.984
Her period. Yeah.

15:22.888 --> 15:24.689
Keith...

15:25.424 --> 15:27.158
She's nine years old.
For Christ's sake.

15:27.160 --> 15:30.528
Well, it can happen very early.
Well, maybe in California...

15:30.530 --> 15:32.897
Oh, Keith. Look, it's
not exactly common,

15:32.899 --> 15:37.702
but you said it didn't look like the
blood was coming from a cut and I...

15:39.038 --> 15:41.572
Why don't I just go in and
take a look at her...

15:41.574 --> 15:44.108
and we'll get to the
bottom of all this. No!

15:44.110 --> 15:46.377
Keith... Nobody touches her!

15:46.379 --> 15:49.914
Please, Keith, you have
to let me examine her...

15:49.916 --> 15:51.015
so that we know how to help her.

15:51.017 --> 15:54.118
The last thing I need is you
playing doctor. Okay. Okay.

15:54.120 --> 15:58.423
Keith, look, what's important right
now is Molly's safety, all right?

15:58.425 --> 16:00.992
And we are only here...
All of us... to help.

16:00.994 --> 16:06.030
You want to help? Keep your
son away from my daughter!

16:14.106 --> 16:17.442
Take Mom inside, please.

16:18.877 --> 16:24.082
Evelyn, maybe it's a better
idea if you were to go inside.

16:26.752 --> 16:28.186
Don, just...

16:28.188 --> 16:32.423
You didn't do anything wrong.
You didn't do anything wrong.

16:32.425 --> 16:33.825
I tried. It's okay. It's okay.

16:33.827 --> 16:37.128
Just come sit down and talk
to us for a second, okay?

16:37.130 --> 16:41.799
All right, Keith is just a
little bit worried about, um...

16:41.801 --> 16:44.135
About, uh, Molly right now.

16:44.137 --> 16:47.305
Do you think I did something to her?
Oh, no, no.

16:47.307 --> 16:50.875
I couldn't have done anything to her.
I know, and...

16:50.877 --> 16:52.944
everybody knows that.

16:52.946 --> 16:57.615
But, Mom, I... I physically
couldn't do anything to her.

16:57.617 --> 16:58.916
Okay, you know what,
this is not...

16:58.918 --> 17:02.186
We should tell everybody now.
I mean...

17:02.188 --> 17:04.856
I know these people, and
they're not very accepting.

17:04.858 --> 17:09.861
If you say something now, it's
just gonna be one more thing.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.700
You follow your mom's lead here.

17:16.367 --> 17:19.137
Why can't anyone in this
family just tell the truth?

17:19.138 --> 17:21.672
Honey, hey... I am going inside!

17:21.674 --> 17:24.642
Am I allowed to do that?

17:27.579 --> 17:30.581
Molly's in the bedroom.

17:31.050 --> 17:34.419
Well, why am I so... Hey, Ryder.

17:34.421 --> 17:37.121
Can you draw my picture now?

17:37.589 --> 17:38.056
Hey, hey.

17:38.058 --> 17:40.858
Hey, hey! That's enough! I said
keep him away from my daughter!

17:40.860 --> 17:45.763
We are not using violence around
here, all right? Did he hurt you?

17:45.765 --> 17:48.399
Ruth? Ruth.

17:48.500 --> 17:52.003
Go get your girls and tell them
it's time to go home, all right?

17:52.005 --> 17:53.204
Cindy... No, Ruth.

17:53.206 --> 17:54.672
Don't tell my wife what to do.
Sit down!

17:54.674 --> 17:58.876
Don't tell my wife what to do and don't
tell me to leave my own property!

17:58.878 --> 18:01.079
Why are you doing this to me?

18:01.081 --> 18:03.114
Keep your boy away
from my family!

18:03.116 --> 18:06.517
You fucking asshole. Cindy, let's go.
Let's get in the car.

18:06.519 --> 18:09.520
Will you just tell them please?

18:09.522 --> 18:10.121
Quiet!

18:10.123 --> 18:11.689
This is so stupid!
Just be quiet.

18:11.691 --> 18:14.926
Ryder, let's go. Let's get in the car.
Cindy, let's go!

18:14.928 --> 18:18.930
Everyone, just cut
it out, all right?

18:18.932 --> 18:22.533
Everyone is family!

18:24.570 --> 18:26.637
Cut it out!

18:31.510 --> 18:34.078
Mom, tell them, please.

18:34.080 --> 18:37.882
All right, Ryder, please
just listen to your dad.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.784
Let's just calm down.
Fuck you, okay?

18:39.786 --> 18:41.652
Hey, hey, hey! That's not helping!
I don't care!

18:41.654 --> 18:44.088
I don't care what you think
you stupid, fucking rednecks!

18:44.090 --> 18:46.023
Ryder!

18:46.025 --> 18:48.025
Ryder.

18:48.760 --> 18:50.695
Ryder!

21:24.816 --> 21:27.018
You hiding?

21:28.153 --> 21:29.687
No.

21:29.689 --> 21:31.589
What are you doing then?

21:31.591 --> 21:35.760
I... I don't know. Not hiding.

21:38.964 --> 21:42.233
All right. Well, we'll
see you around.

22:39.891 --> 22:41.826
Hey.

22:48.734 --> 22:51.902
See the alfalfa blooming?

23:05.851 --> 23:11.188
I brought you some long pants.

23:13.325 --> 23:16.227
This warm sweatshirt.

23:30.876 --> 23:34.979
Keith can fly off the handle a bit
sometimes, but he really is a good guy.

23:34.981 --> 23:38.749
He's an asshole. Oh, don't say that.
He's your uncle.

23:38.751 --> 23:41.819
You say he's an asshole
all the time to Dad.

23:44.423 --> 23:47.224
I don't think I do.

23:54.766 --> 23:56.801
So...

23:57.436 --> 23:59.970
let me talk to you a second.

23:59.972 --> 24:01.839
Um...

24:03.708 --> 24:06.043
Grandma thinks it...

24:06.045 --> 24:10.648
Might be best if you could
stay out here tonight.

24:14.119 --> 24:15.853
Here?

24:16.555 --> 24:18.756
Like in here?

24:18.758 --> 24:21.692
It's just for one night.

24:22.527 --> 24:27.331
That'd give everyone a chance to
get comfortable with you again.

24:31.504 --> 24:34.171
She thinks I did it. No, no, no.
Come on.

24:34.173 --> 24:36.607
Why am I the one that
has to stay out here?

24:36.609 --> 24:39.610
Because she knows
you're a smart kid,

24:39.612 --> 24:41.612
and you're gonna be
the bigger person...

24:41.614 --> 24:44.548
and you can help us fix this.

24:49.120 --> 24:51.188
What am I supposed to
do, hunt for food?

24:51.190 --> 24:55.392
Mm. Me and Grandma fixed up a
nice picnic supper for you.

24:55.394 --> 24:58.963
You shouldn't have. Well, we got
to get some food in you somehow.

24:58.965 --> 25:03.400
You'll be eating off these
leftovers for a week.

25:05.704 --> 25:08.739
Why are you talking like that?

25:10.976 --> 25:11.475
Like what?

25:11.477 --> 25:15.212
You're just talking different
and I think that's weird.

25:15.214 --> 25:16.380
I don't think I'm
talking different.

25:16.382 --> 25:21.852
You wouldn't normally say "eating off
these leftovers" if we were at home.

25:21.854 --> 25:25.656
Why wouldn't I? Because
you don't talk like that.

25:25.658 --> 25:27.925
You've been talking differently
since we got here.

25:27.927 --> 25:32.363
Oh, I don't think I'm
talking differently.

25:33.665 --> 25:35.666
Well, it's annoying. Oh.

25:35.668 --> 25:40.170
You sound like an idiot. Well, I...
I think you're making it up, so...

25:40.172 --> 25:42.306
I'm not.

25:43.108 --> 25:44.742
There it's not called
"supper," okay?

25:44.744 --> 25:50.781
And lunch is definitely not called
"dinner." That's just confusing.

27:51.603 --> 27:53.404
Mom. Fuck. Mom...

27:53.406 --> 27:56.507
I'm sorry, Son. I thought
you were asleep.

27:56.509 --> 27:59.309
I was asleep.

28:00.679 --> 28:04.248
I just came to bring
you a blanket.

28:05.283 --> 28:08.052
I don't need a blanket.

28:12.223 --> 28:14.758
Ryder, you're cold.

28:14.760 --> 28:17.361
No, I'm not.

28:24.203 --> 28:28.672
Gosh, this place is a lot
shabbier than I remember it.

28:29.574 --> 28:34.712
I used to hide in here when I
wanted to run away from home.

28:36.815 --> 28:38.182
Mom?

28:38.184 --> 28:39.550
Yeah?

28:39.552 --> 28:41.652
Why does Keith hate you?

28:41.654 --> 28:45.789
What? Why do you say that?

28:49.562 --> 28:52.796
Keith and I...

28:53.699 --> 28:57.101
See, when Grandpa
gave up the farm,

28:57.103 --> 29:00.671
I got money to keep
going to school...

29:00.673 --> 29:03.540
and, I guess, Keith wasn't
real happy about that.

29:03.542 --> 29:08.946
But, at the same time, he got
to inherit all the land, so...

29:10.048 --> 29:12.216
And you...

29:13.818 --> 29:15.352
You are lucky...

29:15.354 --> 29:18.222
because you are...

29:19.090 --> 29:21.058
the only one.

29:21.060 --> 29:22.993
You are the only Monkey Face.

29:22.995 --> 29:26.530
I can give you as much as I want.
Mom...

29:26.532 --> 29:28.298
Mom.

29:28.300 --> 29:31.869
Stop.

29:47.952 --> 29:50.053
Go back to sleep.

29:50.055 --> 29:52.289
Sorry I woke you.

30:14.078 --> 30:16.213
Mom? Yeah?

30:17.816 --> 30:22.386
What are you doing? Nothing.
Just go back to sleep.

30:24.957 --> 30:26.723
Mom...

30:27.258 --> 30:30.394
Is that a sleeping bag?

30:30.396 --> 30:31.261
Yeah.

30:31.263 --> 30:35.299
Why do you have a sleeping bag?

30:35.466 --> 30:40.037
I'm just gonna take a little
nap on the floor here.

30:40.039 --> 30:43.240
No. Are you serious?

30:43.242 --> 30:46.243
Of course I'm serious.

30:46.245 --> 30:48.846
Mom, go back inside.

30:48.848 --> 30:54.218
Come on. It'll be like when
we used to go camping.

30:54.220 --> 30:58.088
Mom, this isn't funny.
Go back inside.

30:58.090 --> 31:02.893
Ryder, I want to
stay here with you.

31:02.895 --> 31:06.430
Will you go back in
the house, please?

31:07.432 --> 31:13.136
You know, this isn't easy
for me either, Ryder.

31:17.809 --> 31:22.980
Just go back to sleep. You
can pretend I'm not here.

31:28.386 --> 31:30.420
Mom?

31:31.623 --> 31:33.557
Yeah, honey?

31:36.127 --> 31:39.329
I really don't want you here.

33:03.848 --> 33:06.883
Mom? Yeah. Actually,
what time is it?

33:06.885 --> 33:08.151
- Can you come outside?
- What?

33:08.153 --> 33:12.356
What happened? Just put your
robe on and come outside.

33:20.298 --> 33:24.568
What's going on, Ryder?

33:25.737 --> 33:27.738
You... come here.

33:46.557 --> 33:48.458
I want you to move
the car around back.

33:48.460 --> 33:50.327
I gonna get something
to take off that pitch,

33:50.329 --> 33:52.162
but we got to move it
before Grandma wakes up.

33:52.164 --> 33:55.999
You want me to move it? Yeah. Do you
know where Grandma feeds her cats?

33:56.001 --> 33:57.734
Yeah. Okay.

34:00.605 --> 34:02.372
Fuck.

35:02.800 --> 35:05.469
Who would do this?

35:14.779 --> 35:17.180
Are they trying to scare me?

35:19.817 --> 35:20.717
See, look.

35:20.719 --> 35:25.122
Oh, we're gonna have this
fixed up in no time.

35:27.558 --> 35:30.494
Um... there was...

35:30.496 --> 35:34.231
There was motorcycle
tracks near the car.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.970
Who's got a motorcycle?

35:44.342 --> 35:47.077
Should we follow them?

35:51.415 --> 35:51.882
Mom?

35:51.884 --> 35:55.418
And what would we do then?

35:56.321 --> 36:01.291
Darn it. Okay, Grandma should
be waking up about now.

36:02.059 --> 36:03.593
Just keep scrubbing.

36:03.595 --> 36:06.029
It's starting to work.

36:06.031 --> 36:08.064
I'll come out in a
little and help out.

36:08.066 --> 36:10.233
Wait, I have to clean all this?

36:10.235 --> 36:12.269
Sorry, honey.

38:31.509 --> 38:34.577
Oh. Who could that be?

38:42.253 --> 38:43.253
Abbey.

38:43.255 --> 38:47.357
What are you doing here? Did you
walk all the way from home?

38:47.359 --> 38:48.892
I rode.

38:52.530 --> 38:53.830
I see.

38:53.832 --> 38:56.533
Did someone come with you?

38:56.535 --> 38:57.701
No.

38:57.703 --> 39:01.271
The other one's for Ryder.

39:02.006 --> 39:04.407
Huh.

39:04.409 --> 39:05.842
Is he here?

39:05.844 --> 39:07.911
Uh, yes, he is.

39:07.913 --> 39:11.514
Honey, there's someone
here to see you.

39:11.516 --> 39:15.018
Do you want to come
in and get some pop?

39:15.020 --> 39:16.820
It's hotter than heck out there.

39:16.822 --> 39:18.455
No, thanks. I'm fine.

39:18.457 --> 39:23.693
Okay. Uh, you-you
remember Abbey.

39:23.695 --> 39:26.196
Yeah. Molly's sister.

39:28.666 --> 39:31.601
My dad wanted me to say sorry
to Ryder for yesterday.

39:31.603 --> 39:36.806
He wanted to say sorry because he was
angry and he shouldn't have yelled.

39:36.808 --> 39:42.112
And he doesn't want Ryder to be
afraid of him or mad at him.

39:42.346 --> 39:42.946
He-He, uh...

39:42.948 --> 39:47.784
He hopes that Ryder will have
dinner with us today at our house,

39:47.786 --> 39:51.354
and he sent me to pick him up.

39:58.529 --> 40:00.697
Just Ryder or...

40:00.865 --> 40:04.501
I don't know. You
could call him.

40:05.637 --> 40:08.071
But I only brought
one extra horse.

40:08.073 --> 40:10.073
Well, we can take the car.

40:10.075 --> 40:12.909
Why am I the only one invited?

40:13.511 --> 40:15.445
I don't know.

40:17.314 --> 40:19.949
Did he say anything else?

40:21.318 --> 40:27.490
He said he just wanted you to feel
welcome at our house on your own.

40:27.892 --> 40:30.860
But only if you want to.

40:34.398 --> 40:36.399
Why don't I give Keith a call?

40:36.401 --> 40:38.134
Mom, can I talk to
you for a second?

40:38.136 --> 40:39.936
Yeah. Are you sure you
don't want to come in...

40:39.938 --> 40:42.639
and have a little something
to drink before you go?

40:42.641 --> 40:43.440
No, thank you.

40:43.442 --> 40:49.312
He didn't want me to stay long,
so I'll just wait here for Ryder.

40:49.314 --> 40:51.114
Mom!

40:51.116 --> 40:53.883
Yeah. Coming.

40:57.255 --> 40:59.422
I think it was Keith
who wrote on the car.

40:59.424 --> 41:03.359
What? Where are you getting that?
Yeah, he's trying to scare me.

41:03.361 --> 41:05.562
Can we let today be peaceful?

41:05.564 --> 41:07.030
What's happening?

41:07.032 --> 41:10.166
I have to go over there.

41:10.534 --> 41:15.538
Are you sure that you want
to go deal with him again?

41:17.241 --> 41:18.708
What kind of... What?

41:18.710 --> 41:20.844
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Oh,
honey, what are you doing?

41:20.846 --> 41:24.247
You cannot wear those to Keith's house.
Yes, I can.

41:24.249 --> 41:26.783
Honey, be smart. I
am being smart, Mom.

41:26.785 --> 41:30.220
Listen, I know you are set on not
listening to your mother right now,

41:30.222 --> 41:31.254
but you do not know
Keith the way I do.

41:31.256 --> 41:33.345
This is not the time to
make a statement. This

41:33.357 --> 41:35.458
is the time to try to
smooth things over.

41:35.460 --> 41:40.864
I am not lying anymore. Will you
get that through your head?

41:41.332 --> 41:44.434
The Ryder I know is
smarter than this.

41:50.841 --> 41:52.108
Go.

41:55.880 --> 41:59.449
You know how to ride? Yeah.

42:01.018 --> 42:05.421
We should go now. Dad said
to be home by dinnertime.

42:21.639 --> 42:25.375
Don't pull on the reins.
Just follow.

42:42.760 --> 42:46.729
I thought that there was a
road leading to your house.

42:46.731 --> 42:48.364
There is.

42:48.366 --> 42:50.066
This way is faster.

42:50.068 --> 42:52.201
Dinner will be ready soon.

42:56.273 --> 43:00.577
Jesus Christ. Is it
always this hot out here?

43:14.925 --> 43:17.193
Whiskey, come on.

43:22.099 --> 43:23.199
Whoa.

43:23.201 --> 43:25.602
Whoa. Whoa.

43:25.604 --> 43:26.803
Whoa.

43:26.805 --> 43:28.972
There's the house.

44:03.073 --> 44:04.874
Whoa.

44:05.876 --> 44:07.844
Hey.

44:13.884 --> 44:16.653
Give me your rein.

44:19.289 --> 44:22.558
All right. Come on.

44:28.132 --> 44:31.901
Hey, Daddy. You guys
are just in time.

44:35.140 --> 44:37.507
How you doing there, Ryder?

44:37.509 --> 44:39.709
All right.

44:43.380 --> 44:44.013
Oh, come on.

44:44.015 --> 44:47.350
You've got to shake my
hand better than that.

44:47.618 --> 44:50.720
I feel like I'm
shaking a dead fish.

44:52.056 --> 44:54.390
No, it's all... It's
all in the grip.

44:54.392 --> 44:56.125
Oh, like...

44:56.127 --> 44:59.462
There you go. All right.

45:00.130 --> 45:02.498
You're welcome in
my home, Ryder.

45:02.500 --> 45:05.068
Any time you need.

45:05.070 --> 45:06.969
All right?

45:07.538 --> 45:09.539
Well, all right.

45:09.541 --> 45:12.942
Okay, come on inside. Girls
are waiting for you.

45:15.779 --> 45:17.280
You almost ready, Ruth?

45:17.282 --> 45:19.716
Yeah. I was just
waiting on you men.

45:19.718 --> 45:22.085
Gotta put this salsa
on the table...

45:22.087 --> 45:24.721
and we are ready to go.

45:24.723 --> 45:27.523
Hey, Mr. Ryder. Where
are your folks?

45:27.525 --> 45:28.958
Uh, they're back at
Grandma's house.

45:28.960 --> 45:32.295
Oh, well, that was nice of
them to let us have you today.

45:32.297 --> 45:33.896
Run and get seven
settings, honey.

45:33.898 --> 45:37.066
- We're having tacos.
- I hope you like tacos.

45:37.068 --> 45:37.867
Yeah. No, that sounds good.

45:37.869 --> 45:41.070
Probably nothing compared to
what Grandma's been feeding you.

45:41.072 --> 45:42.472
It smells great.

45:42.474 --> 45:45.408
It's kind of a serve
yourself sort of deal.

45:45.410 --> 45:47.343
Ready for Molly? I think so.

45:47.345 --> 45:48.244
Molly! Dinner's ready!

45:48.246 --> 45:51.647
Hey, why don't you take the
head of the table today, Ryder.

45:51.649 --> 45:53.049
Ruth, you there.

45:53.051 --> 45:55.218
Ryder, can I get you some pop?

45:55.220 --> 45:56.152
Uh, sure.

45:56.154 --> 45:57.687
Girls, you all want pop?

45:57.689 --> 45:59.222
Yeah.

45:59.224 --> 46:03.126
Okay. Everyone
give me your cups.

46:03.227 --> 46:04.827
Is Molly still in her room?

46:04.829 --> 46:07.897
I called her in. Molly!
We're waiting on you.

46:07.899 --> 46:09.832
Thank you. Mm-hmm.

46:12.337 --> 46:14.370
There she is.

46:15.839 --> 46:18.307
Hi, Molly.

46:47.738 --> 46:49.172
Let's eat.

46:49.174 --> 46:51.808
Yum.

46:53.310 --> 46:55.678
So, Ryder, I was meaning
to tell your mom...

46:55.680 --> 46:58.781
about this, um, winery...
I guess you'd call it,

46:58.783 --> 47:00.016
that just opened east of town.

47:00.018 --> 47:04.654
I read about it in the paper. It seems
like they've got quite the operation.

47:04.656 --> 47:05.087
Really?

47:05.089 --> 47:07.156
Yeah, and I was thinking
to myself, you know,

47:07.158 --> 47:11.294
Cindy's family always brings
wine when they come into town.

47:11.296 --> 47:13.095
I'll bet they'd enjoy this.

47:13.097 --> 47:15.464
Yeah, that-that sounds good.

47:15.466 --> 47:20.069
They ever let you taste wine?
'Cause you're not 21 yet, are you?

47:20.071 --> 47:23.539
Uh, no. I'm 17 but,
um, yeah, like,

47:23.541 --> 47:27.810
you know, at dinner they'll let
me have, like, a glass of wine.

47:27.812 --> 47:29.645
Hey, Ryder.

47:29.647 --> 47:33.216
Which of these girls
looks the oldest to you?

47:33.584 --> 47:34.016
What?

47:34.018 --> 47:36.319
Forget about who's
actually the oldest.

47:36.321 --> 47:38.554
Which one looks the oldest?

47:38.556 --> 47:40.656
I-I don't know.

47:40.891 --> 47:44.126
Well, you don't have
to get it right.

47:46.964 --> 47:49.899
Uh, I...

47:50.167 --> 47:51.734
Molly, I guess.

47:51.736 --> 47:53.736
Okay.

47:53.738 --> 47:56.372
Now, which one... Uh, which
one's the next oldest?

47:56.374 --> 47:58.507
I-I really don't know.

47:58.509 --> 48:00.409
Just guess.

48:02.946 --> 48:04.947
Okay, um...

48:05.249 --> 48:08.184
I guess one, two,

48:08.186 --> 48:10.519
three, four.

48:14.625 --> 48:15.992
Fair enough.

48:15.994 --> 48:20.463
- Guess we have to get you
some new clothes then, Abbey.

48:23.533 --> 48:27.703
Hey, Ryder. We heard
about your big news.

48:28.705 --> 48:32.708
You, uh, won some sort of
trophy at your school?

48:33.510 --> 48:35.278
Mmm.

48:36.713 --> 48:39.849
Yeah, um, it was...

48:39.851 --> 48:42.251
It was a songwriting
competition.

48:42.253 --> 48:44.954
It was last year.

48:45.055 --> 48:47.890
Basically, wait... How
do you know about that?

48:47.991 --> 48:48.791
Grandma must have told us.

48:48.793 --> 48:52.828
She gives us little updates about
you guys every once in a while.

48:52.830 --> 48:54.964
But, um... Yeah it was, uh...

48:54.966 --> 48:56.866
You... Tell me again,
you wrote a song?

48:56.868 --> 49:00.269
I wrote a song and then, um,
I played guitar with it.

49:00.271 --> 49:02.461
- And it was part of, uh, some

49:02.473 --> 49:04.674
school thing, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

49:04.676 --> 49:09.345
See, that is so neat to me that schools
out there have things like that.

49:09.347 --> 49:10.746
Hmm.

49:10.748 --> 49:13.950
I guess it's pretty cool.
Yeah, so...

49:13.952 --> 49:17.486
Well, maybe we'll have to
have you sing it for us.

49:18.689 --> 49:20.990
Sure. I...

49:21.091 --> 49:22.758
Like-Like right now? Or...

49:22.760 --> 49:26.162
Oh, uh... Don't you
need your guitar?

49:26.164 --> 49:30.700
I mean, I could sing it a capella...
if you want.

49:32.102 --> 49:35.004
Well, um... okay.

49:35.006 --> 49:37.773
Yeah, that-that would be
nice, if you'd like to.

49:37.775 --> 49:40.910
I didn't know we were gonna
get serenaded today too.

49:40.912 --> 49:44.814
All right, now, everyone, no eating
while Ryder's singing, okay?

49:45.950 --> 49:50.152
So the, uh, the song
is called <i>All The Way.</i>

49:51.788 --> 49:57.259
♪ I bite my fingers
till the skin is raw ♪

49:57.261 --> 50:02.631
♪ He goes through leather
like a table saw ♪

50:03.333 --> 50:07.069
♪ We eat each other
whole every night ♪

50:07.071 --> 50:13.642
♪ And spit it out until
the skin is light ♪

50:14.478 --> 50:19.782
♪ And I don't know who was
wrong and who was right ♪

50:19.784 --> 50:25.388
♪ But someone spiked the
meat loaf last night ♪

50:25.390 --> 50:30.359
♪ Oh, I'm easy on your eyes

50:30.361 --> 50:35.031
♪ But never on your mind

50:35.033 --> 50:39.869
♪ Oh, and I'll wipe
that pain away ♪

50:39.871 --> 50:44.907
♪ Oh, and I'll wipe
that pain away ♪

50:45.008 --> 50:49.045
♪ All the way

50:49.212 --> 50:53.382
♪ All the way

50:57.087 --> 50:58.387
There's a...

50:58.389 --> 51:01.357
There's-There's another verse.
And, uh...

51:02.726 --> 51:04.560
That was very nice.

51:04.562 --> 51:08.964
Wasn't that nice, Keith?
Oh, very. Yeah.

51:11.334 --> 51:13.202
Well, Ryder, it
certainly is a treat...

51:13.204 --> 51:16.038
every time we get to have
you back on the farm,

51:16.040 --> 51:18.374
even if it only is
for a couple days.

51:18.876 --> 51:23.079
Gosh, sometimes I get so sad thinking
about you and your mom and dad...

51:23.081 --> 51:25.247
all the way out there
with no family around.

51:25.249 --> 51:30.286
Oh, well, I... I mean, we have
a lot of friends, so, it's...

51:30.288 --> 51:32.721
You got any special ladies
out there in California?

51:32.723 --> 51:36.559
Grandma told us that you're not
seeing that Julie girl anymore.

51:37.594 --> 51:39.728
Oh, no, no. We
were just friends.

51:39.730 --> 51:42.198
Oh, come on. I bet you've
gotta fight them off...

51:42.200 --> 51:44.066
with a voice like that.

51:45.536 --> 51:48.804
I... I don't know.

51:48.905 --> 51:51.974
Come on, be honest. Are
you a heartbreaker?

51:51.976 --> 51:55.244
Or are you just teasing,
like your mom used to do?

51:55.246 --> 51:58.380
Keith. I'm taking to Ryder.

52:03.253 --> 52:06.655
Not-Not-Not really.

52:06.657 --> 52:08.891
Why not?

52:11.595 --> 52:14.830
I don't know. I...

52:15.031 --> 52:17.533
- Can-Can I use the bathroom?
- Of course.

52:17.535 --> 52:20.836
It's over there? Mm-hmm.
Just on your right.

52:34.985 --> 52:37.920
Thought we lost you there. No.

52:37.922 --> 52:40.089
Sorry, I didn't know if
you were done or not.

52:40.091 --> 52:42.224
No, that's okay. Sweetheart,
can you grab that?

52:42.226 --> 52:43.192
Can I help with anything?

52:43.194 --> 52:44.827
Oh, no. Don't worry about it.
I got it.

52:44.829 --> 52:46.695
Girls, can you please help
me gather up the place mats?

52:46.697 --> 52:50.766
Molly, why don't you show Ryder your room?
Show him your new trophy.

52:50.768 --> 52:52.935
Okay.

53:06.249 --> 53:08.484
You all right, Ryder?

53:09.819 --> 53:11.153
Yeah.

53:11.155 --> 53:13.322
What's the matter?

53:13.757 --> 53:15.658
Nothing.

53:27.137 --> 53:30.706
Abbey, leave them alone.
Come here!

54:00.237 --> 54:02.204
Sorry, I...

54:04.441 --> 54:07.710
Is that, uh... Is
that your trophy?

54:07.712 --> 54:09.044
Yeah.

54:09.046 --> 54:11.080
It's cool.

54:17.254 --> 54:19.788
Hey, um, are...

54:20.724 --> 54:22.424
Are you okay?

54:22.426 --> 54:25.394
Like-Like from yesterday?

54:27.097 --> 54:28.831
Yeah.

54:54.691 --> 54:59.328
So, pick a number. One,
two, three or four.

55:00.030 --> 55:01.830
Um...

55:01.931 --> 55:05.100
Four.

55:07.037 --> 55:10.839
Pick purple, black,
orange or yellow.

55:13.743 --> 55:15.044
Black.

55:17.580 --> 55:21.417
Pick green, blue, white or red.

55:22.619 --> 55:26.555
Uh, blue, I guess.

55:28.758 --> 55:30.359
Um...

55:34.164 --> 55:36.565
What does it say?

55:39.035 --> 55:42.237
What? What does it say? Wait...

55:42.239 --> 55:43.939
Kids having fun?

55:43.941 --> 55:46.408
Being awful quiet in here.

55:46.509 --> 55:50.112
Hey, Ryder. Why don't you come
outside with me for a second?

55:50.580 --> 55:52.247
Come on.

56:15.872 --> 56:19.408
Did your mom ever tell
you why she left here?

56:22.345 --> 56:27.383
She, uh... She got
into UCLA, right?

56:28.752 --> 56:32.721
She left because she thought
she was better than all this.

56:38.528 --> 56:41.029
Is that what you think?

56:42.966 --> 56:45.033
No. I...

56:45.568 --> 56:47.703
I hope not.

56:51.207 --> 56:54.843
You strike me as someone
who's never held a gun.

56:56.212 --> 56:58.180
Am I right?

56:58.381 --> 57:00.482
Yeah. I-I... No. I mean,

57:00.484 --> 57:03.552
I've held one before.

57:03.554 --> 57:05.053
Yeah?

57:05.055 --> 57:07.389
Did you fire it?

57:07.657 --> 57:08.690
No.

57:08.692 --> 57:12.928
Do you think you'd know
how if you needed to?

57:12.930 --> 57:13.962
I-I don't know.

57:13.964 --> 57:16.231
See, Ryder, I was thinking
yesterday after the picnic,

57:16.233 --> 57:17.900
there are a few things
you should learn...

57:17.902 --> 57:19.802
they probably aren't
teaching you in California.

57:19.804 --> 57:23.405
You look like you might about curl up
in a ball if someone threatened you.

57:23.407 --> 57:25.874
I mean, if someone really
threatened you with a weapon.

57:25.876 --> 57:30.913
I think the least I could do is
show you how to use one of these.

57:31.347 --> 57:33.148
Go on.

57:38.521 --> 57:40.956
Now push this button here.

57:43.761 --> 57:45.761
This is the clip.

57:46.463 --> 57:48.931
See the ammo inside.

57:50.166 --> 57:51.667
You're fully loaded right now,

57:51.669 --> 57:55.404
but you can't fire it
until you cock it.

57:59.175 --> 58:03.345
So if I pulled the trigger
right now it would go off.

58:03.847 --> 58:04.813
Yep.

58:04.815 --> 58:08.417
But it might knock you over
if you held it like that.

58:08.419 --> 58:12.354
You hold it back here,
in a holster behind you.

58:12.356 --> 58:13.755
Now get your finger
off the trigger!

58:13.757 --> 58:16.158
You never hold your finger
on the trigger. Right.

58:16.160 --> 58:18.494
You hold your finger against
the side of the gun...

58:18.496 --> 58:21.129
until you're aimed
and ready to shoot.

58:21.397 --> 58:21.897
All right.

58:21.899 --> 58:25.567
Now, you draw with your right hand
and step forward with your left.

58:25.569 --> 58:26.502
One fluid motion.

58:26.504 --> 58:28.370
Bring your left
hand up to meet it.

58:28.372 --> 58:30.339
Hold it with two hands.
There you go.

58:30.341 --> 58:33.141
Your left arm is in front
to protect your vitals,

58:33.143 --> 58:36.011
and your right arm
will take the kick.

58:36.013 --> 58:38.313
N-Now do I put my
finger on the trigger?

58:38.315 --> 58:41.450
Yes, you would, but
don't do it yet.

58:42.018 --> 58:44.253
Let's say you fired
off eight rounds...

58:44.255 --> 58:46.221
and he's still coming at you.

58:46.223 --> 58:46.855
You want to reload.

58:46.857 --> 58:49.113
If you were really
firing, the last bullet

58:49.125 --> 58:51.393
would have pulled the
slide back like this.

58:51.395 --> 58:54.596
Now pop out the old clip.
That button.

58:54.598 --> 58:58.934
Keep your ammo here.
Put the new clip in.

58:59.369 --> 59:02.771
Press down that slide
lock right there.

59:04.407 --> 59:06.942
Now you're ready to go.

59:08.545 --> 59:11.013
That fucker's gone.

59:15.351 --> 59:17.753
When you have a gun,

59:18.288 --> 59:20.956
you don't have to be scared.

59:22.725 --> 59:25.928
You're ready to
protect yourself.

59:25.930 --> 59:28.397
Protect your family.

59:33.369 --> 59:37.205
Now this is a sign of
trust between us, Ryder.

59:40.009 --> 59:42.277
Do you trust me?

59:44.681 --> 59:46.949
Yes.

59:47.550 --> 59:51.587
Are you saying that 'cause you
think it's what I want to hear?

59:51.589 --> 59:54.056
Or do you really trust me?

59:55.658 --> 59:58.627
I-I don't know.

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:07.302
All right.

01:00:07.704 --> 01:00:10.305
Now give me the gun.

01:00:33.896 --> 01:00:37.299
I'm glad we got to
speak today, Ryder.

01:00:40.269 --> 01:00:42.671
Molly will be right out.

01:01:16.706 --> 01:01:19.241
Aren't you coming?

01:01:31.055 --> 01:01:33.522
Do you know how to
get to Grandma's.

01:01:33.524 --> 01:01:36.558
Of course I do.

01:01:36.659 --> 01:01:38.960
Come on.

01:01:38.962 --> 01:01:40.896
Let's go.

01:02:11.194 --> 01:02:13.428
Is your dad mad at us?

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:17.766
Molly. No.

01:02:21.971 --> 01:02:24.606
Why was he acting like that?

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:28.410
Like what?

01:02:28.412 --> 01:02:30.512
Like at lunch.

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:33.081
I don't know.

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:34.716
Molly, I'm serious. I mean...

01:02:34.718 --> 01:02:36.451
What's going on?

01:02:36.453 --> 01:02:40.655
Wasn't he making you
feel uncomfortable too?

01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:45.360
I don't want to talk
about that anymore.

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:53.969
Is this the way we came?

01:02:54.303 --> 01:02:58.006
I don't remember going through
this when we came here.

01:02:58.008 --> 01:03:00.575
You know where you're going?
Yep.

01:03:00.577 --> 01:03:04.713
What... Isn't the
house back that way?

01:03:04.715 --> 01:03:08.316
But there horses
need a drink first.

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:51.359
Molly?

01:03:51.361 --> 01:03:54.896
What... Hey, what are you doing?

01:03:55.331 --> 01:03:56.932
Going swimming.

01:03:56.934 --> 01:03:58.967
I thought you were
taking me home.

01:03:58.969 --> 01:04:03.271
I am taking you home, right
after we go swimming.

01:04:03.273 --> 01:04:06.308
Molly, I'm-I'm not
going swimming.

01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:07.642
Why not?

01:04:09.278 --> 01:04:11.713
Because I don't have a swimsuit.

01:04:11.715 --> 01:04:14.216
You have shorts.

01:04:14.383 --> 01:04:16.084
Molly, what are... No! Hey!

01:04:16.086 --> 01:04:17.419
Don't... M-Molly! Hey!

01:04:17.421 --> 01:04:20.021
Don't you like swimming?

01:04:20.023 --> 01:04:22.924
D-Don't... Will you not
go any farther, please.

01:04:22.926 --> 01:04:24.492
I...

01:04:24.494 --> 01:04:25.694
Fuck.

01:04:25.696 --> 01:04:29.865
Okay, just stay right there.
Okay? I'm coming.

01:04:34.103 --> 01:04:35.403
Stop.

01:04:36.439 --> 01:04:37.973
Whoa, it's cold.

01:04:37.975 --> 01:04:40.175
Come here, come here.

01:04:40.177 --> 01:04:43.678
What are you doing?

01:04:44.247 --> 01:04:47.382
Stop. Okay, okay, okay, okay!

01:04:52.456 --> 01:04:54.256
What are you always
giggling about?

01:04:54.258 --> 01:04:56.491
Your sunglasses.
What about them?

01:04:56.493 --> 01:04:59.895
You're not gonna take them off?
No.

01:05:00.363 --> 01:05:03.531
You can't swim with them.

01:05:03.533 --> 01:05:05.267
Yes, I can.

01:05:07.336 --> 01:05:08.603
Can I wear them?

01:05:08.605 --> 01:05:10.272
Can you wear them? Yep.

01:05:11.842 --> 01:05:13.508
I don't know. What?

01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:16.478
Okay, you can wear them...
Hey, hey. No, no.

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:20.081
You can wear them, but you
can't get them wet. Okay?

01:05:20.083 --> 01:05:22.717
Okay. Okay? Here.

01:05:27.556 --> 01:05:29.824
Do I look like I'm
from California?

01:05:29.826 --> 01:05:31.259
Oh, yeah.

01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:31.893
Nice.

01:05:31.895 --> 01:05:36.164
♪ California girls

01:05:36.166 --> 01:05:38.934
I'm from California.

01:05:39.168 --> 01:05:42.203
If I wore these to school, all
my friends would be like,

01:05:42.205 --> 01:05:43.405
"Where did you get them?" Yeah?

01:05:43.407 --> 01:05:46.007
And I'd say they're from
my California cousin.

01:05:46.009 --> 01:05:47.776
Mmm.

01:05:47.778 --> 01:05:51.012
I told all my friends I
have a California cousin.

01:05:51.014 --> 01:05:51.646
Yeah? Yep.

01:05:51.648 --> 01:05:54.316
And I also showed them
the pictures you drew.

01:05:54.318 --> 01:05:55.083
Oh, wow.

01:05:55.085 --> 01:05:58.586
Do you, um... Do you know
anybody else that draws?

01:05:58.588 --> 01:06:01.389
Yeah, but they're not that good.

01:06:01.391 --> 01:06:03.425
Oh. You're a lot better.

01:06:03.427 --> 01:06:06.194
A lot better. Aw.

01:06:06.696 --> 01:06:08.663
Who's your favorite cousin?

01:06:08.665 --> 01:06:10.598
I don't know.

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:11.433
Whoa!

01:06:11.435 --> 01:06:13.101
Okay, okay. Maybe you.

01:06:13.103 --> 01:06:16.771
I mean, I don't know. I don't
really know all my cousins.

01:06:16.773 --> 01:06:17.672
Stop.

01:06:17.674 --> 01:06:19.941
I have a boyfriend.

01:06:20.376 --> 01:06:21.743
You do? Yep.

01:06:21.745 --> 01:06:25.046
None of my other sisters
ever had one before.

01:06:25.048 --> 01:06:29.517
Abbey's mad because she's older than me.
But I'm prettier.

01:06:29.519 --> 01:06:32.253
Don't you think I'm prettier?

01:06:32.255 --> 01:06:32.887
Ow!

01:06:32.889 --> 01:06:34.389
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey!

01:06:34.391 --> 01:06:37.692
I think you're pretty.
I think you're pretty.

01:06:37.694 --> 01:06:38.994
I do.

01:06:38.996 --> 01:06:41.429
I think you're pretty.

01:06:42.766 --> 01:06:45.567
I always do everything
before Abbey.

01:06:45.569 --> 01:06:48.003
Do your parents know
about your boyfriend?

01:06:48.005 --> 01:06:50.739
They don't know about him.

01:06:50.741 --> 01:06:53.108
Would they be mad?

01:06:54.777 --> 01:06:56.044
I don't know.

01:06:56.046 --> 01:06:59.381
You know, you're like nine.
Yeah.

01:06:59.482 --> 01:07:04.586
So, then... are you, like, the
most popular girl at your school?

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:08.189
I don't know. Maybe.

01:07:08.191 --> 01:07:10.358
Hey.

01:07:16.499 --> 01:07:17.999
Ow.

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:22.170
All nice and pretty.

01:07:31.347 --> 01:07:34.015
Pretty. What?

01:07:38.522 --> 01:07:44.325
How come you always come to Nebraska
and we never go to California?

01:07:44.327 --> 01:07:45.593
I don't know.

01:07:45.595 --> 01:07:47.862
Hey, maybe you should
come visit sometime.

01:07:47.864 --> 01:07:49.364
Really? Yeah.

01:07:49.366 --> 01:07:51.032
Nice.

01:07:53.536 --> 01:07:57.272
I don't want to
live here anymore.

01:07:57.274 --> 01:07:58.239
Why not?

01:07:58.241 --> 01:08:01.076
Your whole family lives here.

01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:03.344
They're not my real family.

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:07.315
You mean you're adopted?

01:08:09.218 --> 01:08:10.852
No.

01:08:14.857 --> 01:08:18.292
You're making my glasses all wet!
Hey!

01:08:18.295 --> 01:08:19.426
Come on. Mud!

01:08:19.429 --> 01:08:21.095
No, no, no.

01:08:23.666 --> 01:08:25.899
Oh. What are you doing?

01:08:25.902 --> 01:08:27.969
Chicken fighting.
Chicken fighting?

01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:31.238
Who are we gonna chicken fight?
I don't know.

01:08:31.241 --> 01:08:36.444
Well, it's not fun unless we
have someone to chicken fight.

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:38.746
Okay, where we wanna go?
Where we wanna go?

01:08:38.747 --> 01:08:42.350
What, are you copying me?
Huh? Huh?

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:46.587
Molly, you're kind
of squeezing me.

01:12:24.306 --> 01:12:26.541
Ryder?

01:12:26.642 --> 01:12:30.745
Your mom was about to send
out a search party for you.

01:12:30.747 --> 01:12:32.380
We heard you folks are
leaving tomorrow,

01:12:32.382 --> 01:12:35.817
so we just thought we'd
drop by to see you off.

01:12:36.685 --> 01:12:37.552
Honey?

01:12:37.554 --> 01:12:40.655
Hey, come on. Sit down with
us for a second, all right?

01:12:40.657 --> 01:12:44.459
Just join us. Come sit here.

01:12:45.294 --> 01:12:48.730
Sit down. You want some
malted milk or something?

01:12:48.732 --> 01:12:51.065
No. No, thanks.

01:12:55.437 --> 01:12:57.939
So, uh, Molly was saying...

01:12:57.941 --> 01:13:01.075
the two of you went
swimming today.

01:13:01.844 --> 01:13:03.644
Mm-hmm.

01:13:04.914 --> 01:13:06.514
I was just telling
your mom and dad...

01:13:06.516 --> 01:13:08.683
how much we enjoyed
your singing today.

01:13:09.686 --> 01:13:11.419
We always knew you could draw.

01:13:11.421 --> 01:13:12.553
I think I knew you liked music,

01:13:12.555 --> 01:13:15.089
but I don't think we ever
actually heard you sing before.

01:13:15.091 --> 01:13:18.659
Oh, he is our singer, all right.
He's got it.

01:13:18.661 --> 01:13:22.964
Who needs a, uh, home stereo
when you got this guy?

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:27.769
Seems like you're just one of
those all-around artistic people.

01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:31.572
Probably could do anything
you set your mind to.

01:13:33.942 --> 01:13:36.010
Listen, Ryder.

01:13:36.012 --> 01:13:40.348
I just wanna make sure that you
and, well, and your folks know...

01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:43.718
how sorry I am about
what happened yesterday.

01:13:43.852 --> 01:13:47.655
You're a good kid.
And you're honest.

01:13:47.657 --> 01:13:50.191
Your mom raised you right.

01:13:50.193 --> 01:13:52.026
And I trust you'd
never do anything...

01:13:52.028 --> 01:13:54.962
but be a good father
figure to Molly.

01:14:02.504 --> 01:14:05.239
I don't wanna go on
about it, but...

01:14:05.241 --> 01:14:08.376
I hope we can let this rest now.

01:14:11.548 --> 01:14:13.347
Ryder.

01:14:16.051 --> 01:14:17.518
Yeah, we can.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.720
Okay. Good, good. So...

01:14:19.722 --> 01:14:22.423
we're all a family
and we're gonna...

01:14:22.425 --> 01:14:25.626
We're gonna go on being a
family no matter what.

01:14:25.628 --> 01:14:28.996
- Wouldn't have it any other way.
- All right.

01:14:28.998 --> 01:14:32.233
Well. Good, then.

01:14:35.538 --> 01:14:38.840
Hey, did you show Ryder your chicken
fighting down at the river today?

01:14:38.842 --> 01:14:42.276
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

01:14:42.945 --> 01:14:45.546
Did he know how to play?

01:14:45.548 --> 01:14:46.814
Uh-uh.

01:14:46.816 --> 01:14:49.951
He didn't?

01:14:50.619 --> 01:14:54.355
Didn't your mother teach
you that one, Ryder?

01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:58.993
She used to love that
game when we were little.

01:14:59.261 --> 01:15:03.264
She was always asking me to go
down to the river with her...

01:15:03.266 --> 01:15:06.000
to go chicken fighting.

01:15:08.403 --> 01:15:10.638
Cindy?

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:15.009
What is this, uh... What
is chicken fighting?

01:15:16.678 --> 01:15:19.113
How about you, Ryder?

01:15:19.115 --> 01:15:22.817
You like chicken fighting too?

01:15:24.553 --> 01:15:28.222
Did I just miss something here?

01:15:30.492 --> 01:15:34.462
