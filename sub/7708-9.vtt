WEBVTT

00:01.836 --> 00:03.702
What a mess.

00:04.939 --> 00:06.605
I cannot believe you exploded

00:06.607 --> 00:09.842
a dozen eggs in our microwave.

00:09.844 --> 00:14.413
Don't worry. I'll lick it clean
like I always do.

00:16.450 --> 00:20.686
I will thank you to keep your
tongue off our appliances.

00:20.688 --> 00:23.822
Fine. Another arbitrary rule.

00:24.959 --> 00:28.927
Kate, I have some very bad news.

00:28.929 --> 00:30.429
What? What is it?

00:30.431 --> 00:33.465
I-I found the cat
outside by the fence.

00:33.467 --> 00:36.735
- He's dead.
- Lucky?

00:36.737 --> 00:39.071
Oh, no.

00:39.073 --> 00:40.939
So, what's the bad news?

00:42.543 --> 00:45.711
That was the bad news.
Thank you for your concern.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.446
Well, honey, what-what happened?

00:47.448 --> 00:50.616
Well, he must have died
in his sleep.

00:50.618 --> 00:53.719
Apparently, he was a lot older
than the vet said he was.

00:53.721 --> 00:57.089
I-I wrapped him in a towel
and put him in the garage.

00:57.091 --> 00:58.624
Poor Lucky.

00:58.626 --> 01:02.094
Oh, this is gonna be
so hard for Brian.

01:02.096 --> 01:04.797
The Luck Meister is dead.

01:04.799 --> 01:09.234
This is indeed a very dark day
for anyone who knew him

01:09.236 --> 01:10.936
or chased him.

01:12.306 --> 01:15.841
Is the Crock-Pot
still under the sink?

01:15.843 --> 01:18.844
[theme music]

01:48.876 --> 01:51.877
[music continues]

02:17.404 --> 02:19.905
[instrumental music]

02:21.542 --> 02:26.478
Please take good care of Lucky,
and let him be happy.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.181
Tell him we miss him. Amen.

02:30.618 --> 02:34.486
Lynn, that was indeed beautiful.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.588
I'm reminded of a prayer
he used to recite

02:36.590 --> 02:39.291
every night before bed.

02:39.293 --> 02:42.628
"And if I die before I wake

02:42.630 --> 02:45.531
chicken fry me like a steak."

02:47.201 --> 02:49.034
- ALF!
- Hey.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.769
They were his words.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.671
[Willie clears throat]

02:55.509 --> 02:58.310
Life is eternal

02:58.312 --> 03:01.680
and, uh, love is immortal

03:01.682 --> 03:04.883
and death is but a horizon.

03:11.292 --> 03:16.895
What we return to the Earth,
we receive back...tenfold.

03:18.299 --> 03:21.833
Tragic. A tragic waste.

03:24.104 --> 03:26.271
Wouldn't you
like to say something, Bri?

03:26.273 --> 03:27.873
- No.
- Honey..

03:27.875 --> 03:31.577
It might make you feel better
if you say goodbye to him.

03:31.579 --> 03:34.179
- Bye.
- Whoa.

03:34.181 --> 03:36.615
What a load off.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.917
Brian, uh, it's okay

03:38.919 --> 03:41.720
if you don't wanna say anything,
you don't have to.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.590
There's nothing I wanna say.

03:44.592 --> 03:46.792
Come on, Bri.
Let's go inside.

03:48.229 --> 03:50.162
Funeral poopers!

03:52.333 --> 03:56.301
Don't you have any respect
for people's feelings?

03:56.303 --> 03:58.470
Well, excuse me.

03:58.472 --> 04:01.740
But where I'm from,
this is ludicrous.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.810
It's like having a funeral
for a hamburger.

04:06.547 --> 04:10.015
Why don't you just, uh,
go inside with them.

04:10.017 --> 04:14.419
Why? I thought I'd help you
bury the little patty melt.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.021
Not a chance.

04:16.023 --> 04:19.191
I'm gonna bury him
in an undisclosed place.

04:19.193 --> 04:22.728
Well, can I at least
put something in there with him?

04:22.730 --> 04:26.932
Oh, yeah, sure. Go ahead.
Just hurry up.

04:28.235 --> 04:31.270
This was Lucky's favorite toy.

04:31.272 --> 04:35.440
He loved the sound
the little metal bell made.

04:35.442 --> 04:38.644
It wasn't exactly
the deepest cat in the world.

04:38.646 --> 04:41.847
[jingling]

04:47.221 --> 04:50.289
I'm sure that
Lucky will treasure this.

04:53.394 --> 04:56.795
This would go well
with a full-bodied Chianti.

04:58.632 --> 05:01.833
[instrumental music]

05:04.705 --> 05:07.506
(ALF)
'Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.'

05:07.508 --> 05:09.608
Here, kitty, kitty.

05:09.610 --> 05:11.510
Here, kitty.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.945
Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty.

05:13.947 --> 05:15.013
Come on.

05:15.015 --> 05:18.317
I know you're out here.
Here, kitty, kitty..

05:18.319 --> 05:19.685
[gasps]

05:20.788 --> 05:24.356
What are you doing
with that metal detector?

05:24.358 --> 05:26.258
This isn't a weed wacker?

05:26.260 --> 05:29.161
Well, no wonder
it's taking so long!

05:30.698 --> 05:34.199
Are you looking for this?

05:34.201 --> 05:36.001
No. Uh..

05:36.003 --> 05:37.769
I was looking for quarters.

05:37.771 --> 05:40.972
Yeah. Hind quarters.

05:42.776 --> 05:46.411
You were looking for
Lucky's body, weren't you?

05:46.413 --> 05:48.747
Well...yes.

05:48.749 --> 05:51.383
I thought there should be
an autopsy.

05:51.385 --> 05:52.818
A what?

05:52.820 --> 05:55.220
There are still
a lot of unanswered questions

05:55.222 --> 05:56.722
surrounding his death.

05:56.724 --> 05:59.624
I've formulated
a second-gun theory.

06:01.328 --> 06:03.829
What is your problem?

06:03.831 --> 06:06.732
Willie, I must eat cat.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.667
It burns in my blood!

06:08.669 --> 06:11.536
It's the fire in my loins!

06:11.538 --> 06:14.940
Fish gotta swim,
birds gotta fly

06:14.942 --> 06:19.010
why then, oh, why can't I?

06:20.714 --> 06:22.647
I don't wanna hear this.

06:22.649 --> 06:26.985
Melmacians who didn't eat cat
were considered sissies.

06:26.987 --> 06:29.354
We spat on cat lovers.

06:32.526 --> 06:35.093
Don't spit on my shoe.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.662
I thought a visual aid
might help.

06:37.664 --> 06:40.832
(Trevor)
'Hey, Tanner,
what's going on out there?'

06:40.834 --> 06:42.701
Hide! Quick!

06:44.138 --> 06:48.206
By the way, that's
Trevor's weed wacker. Play dumb.

06:50.677 --> 06:52.878
[instrumental music]

06:56.250 --> 06:58.383
Hurry, Bri. We're gonna be late
for church.

06:58.385 --> 06:59.851
I'm not hungry.

06:59.853 --> 07:03.221
Honey, it's a shame
to waste good food.

07:03.223 --> 07:05.424
Why don't you bury it
in the backyard?

07:05.426 --> 07:07.392
That way you'll have
something out there

07:07.394 --> 07:09.394
from all the food groups.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.698
You know, Brian,
we all loved Lucky

07:13.700 --> 07:15.567
uh, and we all miss him,
but he's gone now

07:15.569 --> 07:18.837
and sometimes the best way
to get over the loss of a pet

07:18.839 --> 07:22.874
is just go right out
and get yourself another one.

07:22.876 --> 07:25.076
Same as losing a wife.

07:28.015 --> 07:30.148
The want ads here
are full of people

07:30.150 --> 07:34.286
wh-who are giving away
all sorts of pets.

07:34.288 --> 07:35.887
"Giving away?"

07:35.889 --> 07:40.091
Would that include cats,
nature's perfect food.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.195
We're not getting a cat.

07:43.197 --> 07:46.064
Uh, if anything,
we'll get a dog.

07:46.066 --> 07:50.802
A dog? Oh, like I need the
competition for table scraps.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.805
I don't want a dog.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.807
Me either.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.443
Not enough gristle.

07:58.445 --> 08:01.179
Breakfast is over.
We all need some air.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.648
- Come on, Bri.
- See you after church, ALF.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.951
Yeah. Put a good word in for me.

08:05.953 --> 08:08.453
Not that I need it.

08:08.455 --> 08:11.590
Don't do any more
treasure hunting.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.225
How can I?

08:13.227 --> 08:17.629
It's not like Lucky had any
silver fillings in his teeth.

08:17.631 --> 08:18.797
Did he?

08:18.799 --> 08:20.999
[sighs]
Goodbye, ALF.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.135
Free cats.

08:25.372 --> 08:26.905
Wonder if they deliver.

08:27.908 --> 08:31.443
No, I can't.
Willie'll kill me.

08:34.381 --> 08:39.117
Well, maybe if I just eat
the feet, nobody'll notice.

08:40.420 --> 08:43.421
[instrumental music]

08:45.592 --> 08:48.560
So, any last meows?

08:48.562 --> 08:51.496
Huh? No.

08:51.498 --> 08:54.266
Then I'll see you in a few days.

08:57.771 --> 09:00.005
You're kind of small,
aren't you?

09:00.007 --> 09:02.674
Well, at least you won't claw
so much going down.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.676
[meows]

09:04.678 --> 09:06.578
Don't look at me like that.

09:06.580 --> 09:07.646
[meows]

09:07.648 --> 09:09.948
Oh, no.

09:11.084 --> 09:14.519
[groans]
What's wrong with me?

09:16.290 --> 09:20.125
Maybe you have an ugly brother
or sister in that box.

09:21.461 --> 09:24.462
[meows]

09:25.165 --> 09:26.131
Yeah!

09:26.133 --> 09:29.301
Now, you're ugly enough to eat.

09:29.303 --> 09:30.735
[Lynn chuckling]

09:30.737 --> 09:32.437
[indistinct]

09:33.574 --> 09:35.073
What cats?

09:38.445 --> 09:39.978
Where did you get these?

09:39.980 --> 09:42.847
Um, they came
for Lucky's funeral.

09:42.849 --> 09:44.449
They brought casseroles.

09:44.451 --> 09:47.185
What was I gonna do,
turn them away?

09:48.488 --> 09:52.524
Alright, alright.
I called an ad in the paper.

09:52.526 --> 09:55.393
How many did you eat?

09:55.395 --> 09:58.229
- None.
- I don't believe you, ALF.

09:58.231 --> 10:01.032
Alright, then give me
a bucket and a moment to myself

10:01.034 --> 10:03.068
and I'll show you.

10:03.070 --> 10:04.769
We'll take your word for it.

10:04.771 --> 10:09.307
It makes me sick to even think
that you would eat a cat.

10:09.309 --> 10:13.411
There'll be no eating of cats
in this house. Do you hear me?

10:13.413 --> 10:16.581
Alright. But that rule
has to apply to everybody

10:16.583 --> 10:17.983
for it to mean anything.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.953
(Trevor)
'Hey, Tanner, you guys in?'

10:21.955 --> 10:24.322
Maybe we can get the Ochmoneks
to take them.

10:24.324 --> 10:27.192
They'd be better off
on the freeway.

10:31.531 --> 10:32.864
Well, hi Trevor, Raquel.

10:32.866 --> 10:35.066
Hi, Kate. Hey, Willie?

10:35.068 --> 10:37.502
Raquel and I are going
treasure hunting in Malibu.

10:37.504 --> 10:39.037
You guys wanna come?

10:39.039 --> 10:42.140
We're gonna hang around outside
Larry Hagman's house.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.375
Last week I found a watch.

10:43.377 --> 10:46.011
- Look.
- It's lovely.

10:46.013 --> 10:48.480
And I can wear it in the shower.

10:48.482 --> 10:50.849
Well, as exciting
as that sounds, uh

10:50.851 --> 10:54.452
we're kind of busy, we've gotta
find a home for these kittens

10:54.454 --> 10:57.222
that were suspiciously left
on our doorstep.

10:57.224 --> 10:59.557
We'd take one,
but Raquel's allergic.

10:59.559 --> 11:02.894
She breaks out in these
big red welts that drip.

11:02.896 --> 11:05.697
Trevor, please.
Some things are private.

11:05.699 --> 11:09.067
Then why did you pose for the
cover of that medical journal?

11:09.069 --> 11:12.437
I was young,
and I needed the money.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.707
Aren't you gonna
lose the sun soon?

11:15.709 --> 11:18.209
Good point. See you later.

11:22.549 --> 11:27.152
You know, we should spring
for an electric fence.

11:29.222 --> 11:32.424
[instrumental music]

11:34.795 --> 11:37.395
Ready to go through with this?

11:37.397 --> 11:39.130
Alright.

11:39.132 --> 11:41.199
<i> Bon appetit.</i>

11:43.170 --> 11:46.738
Hey, hey, if you're gonna put up
a struggle, who needs you!

11:46.740 --> 11:48.173
Gee!

11:49.710 --> 11:52.744
Oh, I can't do it.

11:53.780 --> 11:55.246
That settles it.

11:55.248 --> 11:58.249
I, Gordon Shumway, am a..

12:00.153 --> 12:01.986
...cat lover.

12:01.988 --> 12:04.055
[sighs]

12:04.057 --> 12:05.457
Sorry, ma.

12:06.693 --> 12:08.693
(Kate)
'They're right in here.'

12:12.165 --> 12:13.998
I am so ashamed, papa.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.101
Why can't we get
a purebred Himalayan?

12:16.103 --> 12:17.535
They cost too much, honey.

12:17.537 --> 12:20.839
But how am I supposed
to get attached to a cheap cat?

12:20.841 --> 12:22.841
[awkward chuckle]

12:22.843 --> 12:24.342
Sorry about that.

12:24.344 --> 12:28.313
I thought sending her to
French school meant to France.

12:28.315 --> 12:31.516
I understand. Uh..
Well, here they are.

12:31.518 --> 12:34.419
- Please, uh, pick one.
- Oh, these are great.

12:38.058 --> 12:40.191
Oh, I like the grey one.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.793
- A grey cat?
- Yeah.

12:41.795 --> 12:45.597
You'll have to excuse my father.
He works with his hands.

12:47.134 --> 12:48.767
I guess we'll, uh,
take the black one here.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.502
Good choice. Very good choice.

12:50.504 --> 12:52.170
- There you go.
- Thanks for the kitten.

12:52.172 --> 12:53.872
<i> Merci, madame.</i>

12:53.874 --> 12:55.240
[chuckles]

12:56.209 --> 12:58.576
<i> Au revoir.</i>

12:58.578 --> 12:59.978
Well, I'm glad to see
you're not

12:59.980 --> 13:02.981
giving them away
to just anybody.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.450
ALF, what are you
doing out here?

13:05.452 --> 13:11.289
Oh, Kate, I've discovered
a horrible secret about myself.

13:11.291 --> 13:14.993
I am a cat lover.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.327
[spits]

13:17.731 --> 13:19.330
Hold me?

13:19.332 --> 13:22.433
We know all about
your love of cats, ALF.

13:22.435 --> 13:26.171
That's why we just sent one home
with<i> Les Miserables.</i>

13:26.173 --> 13:28.807
- No, I'm serious!
- Mm-hm.

13:28.809 --> 13:33.278
And what supposedly brought on
this sudden change?

13:33.280 --> 13:36.247
Would you believe I've never
seen a kitten before?

13:36.249 --> 13:39.818
You? You have never seen
a kitten?

13:39.820 --> 13:41.452
Never. Well..

13:41.454 --> 13:43.721
I've seen bits of them
in chowder.

13:45.225 --> 13:49.761
I just had no idea
they were so cute whole.

13:49.763 --> 13:53.631
Nice try, bub.
Now back away from them slowly.

13:53.633 --> 13:56.801
Oh, Kate,
I promise I won't harm a hair

13:56.803 --> 13:59.804
on their fuzzy wittle heads.

14:01.341 --> 14:05.310
- Have I ever lied to you?
- Yes. Several times.

14:05.312 --> 14:07.178
I meant today.

14:10.750 --> 14:13.751
[instrumental music]

14:16.122 --> 14:18.690
[door opens]

14:18.692 --> 14:20.658
Which one did they take?

14:20.660 --> 14:22.594
Oh, I don't wanna know!

14:22.596 --> 14:23.528
No, tell me.

14:23.530 --> 14:26.064
No, no, no, don't tell me!

14:26.066 --> 14:28.199
Tell me.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.101
Stripey one.

14:30.103 --> 14:33.037
Not Tuffy!

14:33.039 --> 14:35.006
Oh, I can't stand this, Willie.

14:35.008 --> 14:40.445
Every time you give away another
kitten, a part of me dies.

14:40.447 --> 14:42.113
Uh-huh.

14:42.115 --> 14:45.183
I tell you,
I'm a changed alien.

14:45.185 --> 14:46.718
You know,
there's an old saying, ALF

14:46.720 --> 14:51.155
the leopard cannot change
his spots.

14:51.157 --> 14:52.490
Whoa, that's deep!

14:52.492 --> 14:55.059
Back up, man, you lost me.

14:55.061 --> 14:57.428
[telephone rings]

14:58.999 --> 15:00.965
Hello. Oh, yeah, Lynn.

15:00.967 --> 15:04.502
There's one kitten left.
The grey one. Heh, the runt.

15:04.504 --> 15:07.071
Hey, I'd like to see
baby pictures of you.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.539
(Willie)
'Alright.'

15:10.744 --> 15:12.543
Well, Lynn's bringing
a friend by.

15:12.545 --> 15:15.313
They're gonna pick up
the last one. The last cat.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.749
Oh, you can't give away
the grey kitten!

15:17.751 --> 15:19.550
He's my favorite.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.653
Oh, I'll change my spots,
Willie!

15:21.655 --> 15:25.556
In fact, I'll endure every bad
analogy you throw my way.

15:26.993 --> 15:28.459
I can't trust you, ALF.

15:28.461 --> 15:31.729
These cats are too much
of a temptation for you.

15:31.731 --> 15:34.899
- Did I ever try to eat Lucky?
- Yes.

15:34.901 --> 15:36.567
I meant today.

15:36.569 --> 15:37.735
Go.

15:38.972 --> 15:43.675
Well, goodbye, kitty.
Have a nice life.

15:43.677 --> 15:45.243
I love that cat.

15:45.245 --> 15:46.978
[spits]

15:46.980 --> 15:49.447
I gotta get a handle on that.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.516
[instrumental music]

15:51.518 --> 15:53.718
And another thing
about having a cat

15:53.720 --> 15:57.088
is a cat won't leave you
for a cheerleader named Buffy.

15:57.090 --> 16:00.358
George and I were gonna spend
the rest of our lives together.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.960
He said I inspired him.

16:01.962 --> 16:04.729
That since he knew me,
he sold more van conversions

16:04.731 --> 16:07.865
than anybody else
at the showroom.

16:07.867 --> 16:11.369
Joanie, it's been a month.

16:11.371 --> 16:14.739
That's three weeks longer
than you went with him.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.708
But it was so right.

16:16.710 --> 16:18.743
Didn't you think
it was right, Lynn?

16:18.745 --> 16:21.245
Listen to me,
you are in danger

16:21.247 --> 16:24.649
of developing
a very bad life pattern.

16:27.020 --> 16:29.887
Hi, dad. Joanie's here
to pick up the kitten.

16:29.889 --> 16:31.956
Oh, good.

16:31.958 --> 16:33.358
How are things, Joanie?

16:33.360 --> 16:36.627
I'm taking your cat.
What does that tell you?

16:38.231 --> 16:40.431
Guess I'll go get it.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.336
Now I'm stuck
with this lousy tattoo

16:45.338 --> 16:48.406
and it doesn't mean anything.

16:48.408 --> 16:51.309
I told you
not to rush into that.

16:51.311 --> 16:53.511
(Willie)
'Oh, I'll strangle him!'

16:55.181 --> 16:56.547
What's wrong, dad?

16:56.549 --> 17:00.551
Uh-uh, it-it seems the cat has,
uh, wandered off.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.021
It figures.

17:06.993 --> 17:08.693
- 'ALF?'
- Stay cool.

17:08.695 --> 17:11.062
Remember, I've been here
the whole time.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.800
Where is that cat?

17:15.802 --> 17:19.337
Why are you asking me?
I've been here the last hour.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.172
Isn't that right, Eric?

17:21.174 --> 17:23.041
[coos]

17:23.043 --> 17:25.410
See?

17:25.412 --> 17:27.745
I don't have time for this.

17:27.747 --> 17:31.049
A morose teenager
has come to take it home.

17:32.752 --> 17:35.820
Do I have to
tear the house apart?

17:36.990 --> 17:38.956
Don't bother.

17:38.958 --> 17:40.892
You won't find it.

17:40.894 --> 17:42.960
Why not?

17:42.962 --> 17:46.898
Because...I ate it.

17:49.469 --> 17:52.970
I can't-I can't believe
that you could

17:52.972 --> 17:55.506
possibly disappoint me
this much!

17:56.776 --> 18:00.445
No more disappointed
than I am in myself, Willie.

18:00.447 --> 18:05.383
Your punishment couldn't begin
to top what I'm going through.

18:05.385 --> 18:08.019
We'll test that theory
in one minute.

18:11.224 --> 18:14.792
You may be looking at the pinata
for your first birthday party.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.128
I'm outta here.

18:19.632 --> 18:23.301
I'm sorry, it appears
that something has happened

18:23.303 --> 18:25.470
to the, uh, kitten.

18:25.472 --> 18:26.938
- I see.
- Joanie.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.372
This is not at all like
what happened

18:28.374 --> 18:30.007
between you and George.

18:30.009 --> 18:31.876
I wanna believe you.

18:33.079 --> 18:34.679
Well..

18:34.681 --> 18:37.882
At least now I'll have something
to talk about at group tonight.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.853
Bye, Mr. Tanner.
I'll call you.

18:41.855 --> 18:43.287
(Lynn)
Alright.

18:43.289 --> 18:47.125
[sighs]
She's one taco short
of a combination plate.

18:47.127 --> 18:48.626
What happened to the kitten?

18:48.628 --> 18:50.795
Uh, it seems ALF..

18:52.098 --> 18:53.865
...ate it.

18:53.867 --> 18:55.166
Oh, my God!

18:56.836 --> 18:59.003
That's just too horrible
to think about.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.538
How do you know?

19:00.540 --> 19:02.006
He admitted it.

19:02.976 --> 19:05.176
Wow.

19:05.178 --> 19:06.844
I knew he was capable

19:06.846 --> 19:10.448
but I never thought he'd
actually go through with it.

19:10.450 --> 19:14.185
One thing is certain.
He'll never do it again!

19:16.556 --> 19:19.457
[instrumental music]

19:19.459 --> 19:22.693
Look, I don't know
how much time we have.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.328
So here's the plan.

19:24.330 --> 19:27.431
How soon do you think
you can get on a game show?

19:28.468 --> 19:30.201
We're gonna need some money.

19:31.271 --> 19:33.671
What, you have a better idea?

19:36.009 --> 19:37.475
(Willie)
'ALF!'

19:40.914 --> 19:44.749
ALF, there you are.
Dad, he's in here.

19:44.751 --> 19:47.652
Is he in a good mood
or a bad mood?

19:47.654 --> 19:50.121
Don't even talk to me.

19:50.123 --> 19:52.657
Guess it's that time, huh?

19:52.659 --> 19:55.960
Doesn't a condemned man
get a last meal?

19:55.962 --> 19:58.262
You just had it!

19:58.264 --> 20:00.464
How about an after-dinner mint?

20:02.602 --> 20:04.702
Dad, what's that?

20:04.704 --> 20:07.705
Ah, pay no attention
to the moving box!

20:07.707 --> 20:11.008
The great and powerful ALF
has spoken.

20:12.212 --> 20:13.911
[chuckling]

20:15.615 --> 20:18.783
Don't take him away from me,
Willie. He's mine.

20:18.785 --> 20:21.786
I'll do anything. Please.

20:21.788 --> 20:24.188
ALF, you were telling the truth.

20:24.190 --> 20:26.390
How many times does a guy
have to spit on himself

20:26.392 --> 20:28.526
before you believe him?

20:28.528 --> 20:31.262
I knew it.
I knew you couldn't eat him.

20:31.264 --> 20:34.832
Then why didn't you
say something? Stick up for me?

20:34.834 --> 20:37.668
What if I was wrong
and you ate him?

20:37.670 --> 20:40.605
This is one of those
logic puzzles, isn't it?

20:40.607 --> 20:43.241
I've never been good at those.

20:43.243 --> 20:44.875
Willie, can I keep him?

20:44.877 --> 20:47.878
- No.
- But why?

20:47.880 --> 20:50.348
Well, I-I don't think
it would be a good idea

20:50.350 --> 20:53.784
i-i-in light of everything.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.486
But he's my friend.

20:55.488 --> 20:58.122
You don't realize how close
you can get with someone

20:58.124 --> 21:00.524
until you've had their head
in your mouth.

21:02.095 --> 21:06.397
You should really have somebody
else do your arguing for you.

21:06.399 --> 21:09.667
Dad, he obviously loves the
kitten. Don't we owe it to him?

21:09.669 --> 21:11.102
Well, what do we owe him?

21:11.104 --> 21:12.970
Lynn, he-he brought
these kittens

21:12.972 --> 21:15.106
into our house without asking.

21:15.108 --> 21:16.707
He tried to eat them.

21:16.709 --> 21:19.210
He actually sat
at the dining room--

21:19.212 --> 21:21.746
Dad, look at him.

21:23.983 --> 21:27.018
He'll be like the son
I never had.

21:28.288 --> 21:29.987
Okay, you can keep him.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.389
Yeah!

21:31.391 --> 21:34.358
Hey, did you hear that,
little fella?

21:34.360 --> 21:37.194
Yeah, you get to stay.

21:38.831 --> 21:41.599
You know, Willie,
my mom was wrong.

21:41.601 --> 21:43.801
It is fun to play
with your food.

Somewhere in this yard

21:55.581 --> 21:58.749
your illustrious
predecessor rests.

21:58.751 --> 22:00.785
At least,
that's what they told me.

22:00.787 --> 22:02.620
They could be lying.

22:02.622 --> 22:05.022
They're an odd family.

22:05.024 --> 22:07.224
- Hi, ALF. What are you doing?
- Hi, B.

22:07.226 --> 22:10.194
I was just showing Flipper
where Lucky was buried.

22:10.196 --> 22:13.798
You named him Flipper?
That's a stupid name.

22:13.800 --> 22:16.467
Hey, don't criticize.

22:16.469 --> 22:18.769
You haven't seen him underwater.

22:18.771 --> 22:22.473
I wanna name him Lucky II.

22:22.475 --> 22:27.511
Brian, are you trying to tell me
that you like this kitten?

22:27.513 --> 22:28.913
No.

22:28.915 --> 22:31.649
Not even just a little?

22:31.651 --> 22:33.851
Well, maybe a little.

22:35.154 --> 22:37.088
Well, maybe a lot.

22:38.191 --> 22:39.023
You know what?

22:39.025 --> 22:40.458
I think you should go inside

22:40.460 --> 22:42.660
and tell that to your folks.

22:42.662 --> 22:45.963
- They like that kind of junk.
- Okay.

22:48.167 --> 22:51.168
You even look
a little like Lucky.

22:51.170 --> 22:52.703
Same fat cheeks.

22:54.140 --> 22:56.107
Same meaty thighs.

22:58.511 --> 23:00.711
Same delectable aroma.

23:01.781 --> 23:04.515
Maybe I should keep him
in my room.

23:04.517 --> 23:07.752
Good idea, B. Why tempt fate?

23:13.159 --> 23:16.160
