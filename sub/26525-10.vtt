WEBVTT

00:57.057 --> 01:01.186
And three, two, one...

01:01.478 --> 01:03.146
Recover.

01:04.022 --> 01:07.317
It's a great workout, huh?

01:08.318 --> 01:09.652
Yeah.

01:10.278 --> 01:13.364
So good. I can feel the burn.

01:17.285 --> 01:18.953
You know, I needed this.

01:19.037 --> 01:21.081
It's been too long
since we've hung out.

01:21.164 --> 01:23.958
-Yeah, I know, you've been so busy.
-Yeah, I know.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.920
I get so deep into these projects
where I'm working alone,

01:27.003 --> 01:28.797
without any sounding board
or support.

01:30.006 --> 01:33.051
Yeah, working alone can be tough,
but exciting, too.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.553
My cousin's worked alone for years and he was telling me
about it the other day...

01:37.472 --> 01:38.890
It was inspiring, actually.

01:39.432 --> 01:41.142
And you have James
to talk about everything with,

01:41.226 --> 01:42.477
I'm sure that's nice.

01:42.560 --> 01:43.895
Well, not everything.

01:45.563 --> 01:46.940
You know how James can be.

01:47.607 --> 01:49.567
You guys haven't made up
since Thanksgiving?

01:50.235 --> 01:51.569
You should talk to him.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.364
He might be more open-minded
than you expect.

01:54.447 --> 01:55.865
And if he's not?

01:55.949 --> 01:57.158
I'll beat him up for you.

01:58.993 --> 02:01.663
<i>Mayday, mayday!</i>
<i>This is McAllister. Backup needed!</i>

02:01.746 --> 02:03.248
Ow! Ooh!

02:03.790 --> 02:04.999
Are you okay?

02:05.667 --> 02:08.002
I got a cramp. It's really bad.

02:08.086 --> 02:10.630
I'm gonna... I'm going to go ice it.

02:11.923 --> 02:13.007
Okay.

02:13.716 --> 02:14.717
Oh.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.119
Oh, no.

02:44.539 --> 02:45.874
Sir?

02:46.166 --> 02:47.375
Sir?

02:49.252 --> 02:51.129
Colonel McAllister?

03:12.108 --> 03:14.903
She has a concussion
and, uh, two broken ribs,

03:14.986 --> 03:16.446
but no internal bleeding.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.114
I'm surprised
to see you here, Supergirl.

03:18.698 --> 03:19.991
I thought the President
was pretty clear

03:20.074 --> 03:21.659
when he dismissed you from the DEO.

03:21.743 --> 03:24.162
Colonel, I didn't come here
because of the DEO.

03:24.245 --> 03:26.497
I came here because
there were people who needed help.

03:27.081 --> 03:28.958
If Supergirl was the first one
on the crime scene,

03:29.042 --> 03:31.044
then maybe she can help us
figure out who did it.

03:31.127 --> 03:35.715
There was another body right there,
a Colonel McAllister,

03:35.798 --> 03:38.468
but he was dragged overboard
by an alien.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.012
What kind of alien?

03:41.095 --> 03:44.057
It was like a shimmer
of refracted light.

03:44.140 --> 03:46.392
So, all you have to contribute
is a shimmer?

03:47.810 --> 03:48.937
To be fair, Colonel,

03:49.020 --> 03:50.939
that's more information
than we would have had otherwise.

03:51.606 --> 03:53.024
I'm sure
I could help with evidence,

03:53.107 --> 03:55.109
I just... I haven't had a chance
to look around.

03:55.193 --> 03:57.612
Thank you,
but this is a DEO crime scene now.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.865
You've contaminated it
enough already.

04:00.949 --> 04:03.076
If it weren't for me, there wouldn't
be a crime scene to begin with.

04:03.159 --> 04:04.452
If I hadn't come here,

04:04.535 --> 04:06.663
a bomb would've blown
this ship to smithereens,

04:06.746 --> 04:07.997
and all the SEALs would've died.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.582
I don't have time to argue with you.

04:10.416 --> 04:13.002
I have to locate the murderous alien
that you let escape.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.087
So, move aside.

04:16.214 --> 04:17.548
That is an order.

04:18.508 --> 04:20.343
Just because I don't work
at the DEO anymore,

04:20.426 --> 04:22.095
doesn't mean I'm going
to stop being a hero.

04:22.178 --> 04:23.304
No matter what you say.

04:37.485 --> 04:39.237
Oh, hi, sorry.
We're not quite open yet--

04:39.320 --> 04:40.405
Brainy.

04:40.488 --> 04:41.739
Hello, J'onn.

04:42.699 --> 04:47.453
Ah, yes.
So, this is your new business...

04:47.537 --> 04:48.830
Mmm-hmm.

04:49.163 --> 04:53.042
Some would say launching
a PI shingle's a bit old-fashioned.

04:54.836 --> 04:57.839
But then again you are very old.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.716
You know, Brainy,
in the last couple of months

05:02.260 --> 05:03.594
I've had the chance to help people,

05:03.678 --> 05:05.847
humans and aliens
who can't go to the police.

05:06.556 --> 05:09.017
I've been trying to carve out a path
ever since I left the DEO,

05:10.518 --> 05:11.936
and, yeah, this feels about right.

05:12.020 --> 05:16.107
Speaking of leaving the DEO,
I'm here to talk about Supergirl.

05:16.190 --> 05:20.570
She's going to require backup,
resources, a girl Friday...

05:21.487 --> 05:25.575
And I believe you are just
the girl Friday for the job.

05:26.826 --> 05:30.079
-I can pay you cash in advance.
-I can't take your money for that.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.581
Why not?

05:32.332 --> 05:35.501
Do you want more? I have more.

05:35.626 --> 05:37.837
No, Brainy,
I can't take your money for that.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.131
Please. Put it away, put it away.

05:40.381 --> 05:42.717
Look, if Supergirl needs me,
all she has to do is ask.

05:43.134 --> 05:45.303
-But since you mentioned it,

05:45.386 --> 05:46.763
I'll let her know that I'm available.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.181
Thank you, J'onn.

05:50.641 --> 05:52.226
No problem.

05:52.310 --> 05:55.980
Uh, Brainy, you dropped something.

05:56.064 --> 05:58.649
-No, that was there--
-No, you dropped it.

05:58.816 --> 05:59.901
Hmm.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.072
You send me the bill, then.

06:04.572 --> 06:06.282
I had hoped that after she was fired,

06:06.365 --> 06:09.535
Supergirl might limit her heroics
to stopping runaway trains

06:09.619 --> 06:11.788
and saving kittens from trees.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.206
That was naive.

06:13.998 --> 06:16.292
The most powerful alien in the world
is out there

06:16.375 --> 06:17.668
and she clearly has every intention

06:17.752 --> 06:19.545
-on making our lives more difficult.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.341
The President should
never have dismissed her

06:23.424 --> 06:24.509
without a contingency plan.

06:25.134 --> 06:27.678
I've never heard
of a shimmering alien, have you?

06:28.429 --> 06:32.558
No. But then again, I'm not familiar
with every cataloged alien life-form.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.979
Priority one for you is to ID
and neutralize the creature

06:37.063 --> 06:38.314
who was behind the attack.

06:38.397 --> 06:40.358
Meanwhile, I'm going
to interrogate Agent Wolf.

06:40.942 --> 06:42.902
Why are you interrogating Agent Wolf?

06:44.237 --> 06:45.988
I'm going to correct
the President's mistake

06:46.072 --> 06:48.783
and make sure
Supergirl listens to us from now on.

06:48.866 --> 06:50.159
How are you going to do that?

06:51.035 --> 06:54.205
Supergirl is an annoyance,
but she's no genius.

06:54.997 --> 06:58.084
At some point during her time here,
someone must have seen something

06:58.167 --> 07:00.002
that's a clue to her secret identity.

07:00.086 --> 07:04.340
And all I need is one loose strand
and I'll unravel this mystery.

07:17.019 --> 07:18.771
All right, I'll make this quick.

07:18.855 --> 07:21.732
You are the only agents that know
Supergirl's secret identity

07:21.858 --> 07:24.360
and Colonel Haley has
only one focus right now,

07:24.444 --> 07:25.611
that's to uncover it.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.947
Once she has Supergirl's identity,

07:28.030 --> 07:31.868
she believes she can reassert control
and keep Supergirl in line.

07:32.493 --> 07:34.412
Keeping that information safe
means that

07:34.495 --> 07:36.289
if Haley confronts you,

07:36.706 --> 07:39.041
you will be lying
to a superior officer.

07:39.125 --> 07:42.128
None of us wants to compromise
Supergirl or you, Director Danvers.

07:42.211 --> 07:44.714
I can't ask you to do anything
against your moral code.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.675
But I am asking that
you deeply consider

07:47.758 --> 07:49.469
the situation we are in together.

07:52.722 --> 07:55.057
I'll do whatever I can
to protect Supergirl.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.894
Same for me.

08:01.230 --> 08:03.733
If confronted,
we could use our RTI training.

08:04.233 --> 08:08.279
If not, we vow to remain silent.

08:10.406 --> 08:11.657
Thank you.

08:12.366 --> 08:13.784
Director Danvers.

08:15.369 --> 08:16.537
Colonel Haley.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.789
Are you and these agents
working on something specific?

08:19.332 --> 08:21.626
Uh, debrief on the morning's attack.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.921
Interesting place for a debriefing.

08:26.255 --> 08:27.840
Agent Lawrence,
I need to speak with you.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.175
Everyone else, dismissed.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.266
Well, that was a close call.

08:37.391 --> 08:39.268
What is RTI training?

08:39.352 --> 08:40.853
Resistance to Interrogation.

08:41.395 --> 08:42.522
Hmm.

08:42.605 --> 08:43.856
I don't need that.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.900
I've recently restructured
my neural network

08:45.983 --> 08:49.529
to form many small compartments
for storing sensitive information.

08:49.612 --> 08:51.072
Why does that not surprise me?

08:51.155 --> 08:52.573
If I so desire it,

08:52.657 --> 08:54.784
I can shut down all access
to one or more compartments

08:54.867 --> 08:56.285
for a designated amount of time.

08:56.661 --> 08:59.080
I'm sorry none of you
share the same capacity.

08:59.664 --> 09:02.166
Of course, I'm doing everything I can
to keep Supergirl safe.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.001
I know you are, Brainy.

09:05.836 --> 09:07.838
I have a sense
she needs more support out there.

09:07.922 --> 09:10.716
Kara and I, we're still partners,
despite Haley.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.803
In fact, she just texted that the coast guard has no record
of that cargo ship.

09:16.847 --> 09:18.182
Which means that
we're going to have to talk to

09:18.266 --> 09:20.685
that Navy SEAL that she saved
as soon as she wakes up.

09:20.768 --> 09:22.645
Yes, about that.

09:22.728 --> 09:26.315
The Navy SEAL was taken
out of DEO custody and has...

09:26.399 --> 09:28.192
Well, how shall I put this...

09:28.276 --> 09:30.111
Disappeared.

09:30.278 --> 09:31.445
What do you mean, "disappeared"?

09:31.529 --> 09:33.364
There's no record
of where she was transferred

09:33.447 --> 09:34.865
or whose custody she's in.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.410
That's odd.

09:37.493 --> 09:40.871
Okay, well, then let's start looking
into McAllister, find out what he--

09:40.997 --> 09:42.623
I was unable to locate
Colonel McAllister

09:42.707 --> 09:45.626
in the government database,
none in black ops either.

09:47.295 --> 09:51.173
Okay, so, there's no cargo ship,
our only witness has disappeared,

09:51.257 --> 09:55.303
and there's no record of McAllister,
who we know was killed on that ship.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.555
<i>This sounds like a cover-up.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

09:57.638 --> 09:59.765
There is no records of anything.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.559
So maybe they were
trying to use that bomb

10:01.642 --> 10:03.519
to, you know, destroy
all the physical evidence, too.

10:03.603 --> 10:04.687
Mmm!

10:05.229 --> 10:07.064
Why do people cover things up?

10:07.398 --> 10:09.817
They should just know that
we're going to figure it out.

10:11.110 --> 10:14.405
Yeah, well, speaking of which...

10:15.156 --> 10:19.285
I hate to bring this up because
I don't want to upset you anymore,

10:19.368 --> 10:23.706
but Haley, she's on a mission
to find out who Supergirl is.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.961
It's not enough that I got fired?

10:30.254 --> 10:32.089
Well, she wants to know your identity

10:32.173 --> 10:34.300
so that she can use it
to keep you in line.

10:34.383 --> 10:37.178
So, please stay off of her radar.

10:37.261 --> 10:38.763
Okay.

10:39.555 --> 10:42.642
So anyway,
the clue trail has gone cold.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.018
Not necessarily.

10:44.101 --> 10:46.604
I mean, you were the only one
who saw what the alien looks like.

10:46.687 --> 10:49.065
Right, the shimmer.

10:49.148 --> 10:52.818
But no one at the DEO has heard
of an alien like that, right?

10:52.902 --> 10:54.445
Maybe it's time we talked to somebody

10:54.528 --> 10:56.530
who was at the DEO
before either of us were.

10:59.700 --> 11:00.826
Knock, knock.

11:02.578 --> 11:03.663
Hey, Lena.

11:03.746 --> 11:07.708
I know you've been
wanting to connect, but I've...

11:07.792 --> 11:09.752
I've been stuck inside myself
and haven't been available.

11:09.835 --> 11:13.255
No, it's okay. I get it.
You're always working.

11:14.048 --> 11:15.216
I am.

11:16.509 --> 11:20.054
But I've also been absent
and I'm here to change that.

11:20.137 --> 11:24.225
So, just tell me what's on your mind.

11:28.062 --> 11:33.109
When you told me that you, how
you helped me with the indictment,

11:35.736 --> 11:39.448
I jumped on my moral high horse
and I rode it into the sunset,

11:39.532 --> 11:41.700
and I felt pretty justified
about being angry.

11:41.784 --> 11:44.286
But after everything I went through
with the Children of Liberty,

11:44.370 --> 11:46.288
I had to rethink some things.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.210
I read your article.

11:52.294 --> 11:53.879
I understand what you went through.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.798
I left some things out.

11:55.881 --> 11:58.843
Like how I condemned the woman I love

11:59.844 --> 12:02.430
for selling out, or what I perceived
to be selling out,

12:03.222 --> 12:05.433
but when I was forced
into the same position,

12:06.934 --> 12:08.102
I did the same thing.

12:08.185 --> 12:10.396
No one will blame you for that,
least of all me.

12:10.479 --> 12:11.856
It's not blame, it's just...

12:13.774 --> 12:15.317
When Agent Liberty wanted me
to break the law,

12:15.401 --> 12:16.819
when he wanted me
to blow up the monument,

12:18.529 --> 12:19.697
I was willing to.

12:19.947 --> 12:21.657
Because you wanted to save someone.

12:21.740 --> 12:23.284
Just like you saved me.

12:24.243 --> 12:25.786
I get it.

12:25.911 --> 12:29.290
Sometimes the ends
do justify the means.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.336
I want you to know something...

12:37.214 --> 12:40.176
I understand what it means
to make hard choices

12:40.259 --> 12:42.470
and I've been wrong.

12:43.012 --> 12:45.473
You don't know how much it means
to me to hear you say that.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.476
No, I don't. How much does it mean?

12:48.851 --> 12:50.060
Um...

12:50.978 --> 12:53.397
-About this much.
-Mmm. Okay.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.444
-Nia Nal.
-Nia Nal.

12:58.527 --> 13:00.112
-None other.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.364
This is a nice surprise. How are you?

13:02.448 --> 13:06.952
I am calling to find out about food.
And your interest in it.

13:07.036 --> 13:09.622
Uh, I'm definitely
interested in food.

13:09.705 --> 13:11.624
Would you like to eat some?

13:11.707 --> 13:14.502
Now

13:14.585 --> 13:17.254
What In person.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.381
<i>And I am thinking at a public place </i>

13:19.465 --> 13:23.052
where food is served to other people
who also appreciate it.

13:23.886 --> 13:25.346
You mean, a restaurant.

13:27.389 --> 13:30.601
-Yes.

13:30.684 --> 13:34.063
The answer is yes.
-Excellent. See you soon.

13:41.362 --> 13:42.696
Hello?

13:42.780 --> 13:44.323
You hung up
before we could make a plan.

13:44.406 --> 13:46.700
Don't you think we should pick
a time and place?

13:46.784 --> 13:48.702
-Yes, of course.
Agent Dox.

13:50.704 --> 13:53.832
I shall return to this thought
in a few minutes, Nia Nal.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.376
-Wait, what--

13:55.459 --> 13:56.585
Brainy?

13:56.669 --> 13:58.003
Yes, Colonel Haley?

13:58.087 --> 14:00.631
I need to speak to you
about Supergirl. Follow me.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.098
J'onn, this is great.

14:09.181 --> 14:10.724
Oh, thank you, Kara.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.268
I got a really good feeling
about this place.

14:13.769 --> 14:17.273
Look, this is the only thing you need
to know you've moved in.

14:18.816 --> 14:22.653
So, shimmering aliens
and a non-existent cargo ship.

14:22.736 --> 14:24.405
Sounds like the plot of a spy novel.

14:24.488 --> 14:26.407
Yeah. Did it ring any bells?

14:26.490 --> 14:28.367
No. But lucky for you,

14:28.450 --> 14:31.662
I did keep files
from my entire tenure at the DEO.

14:32.329 --> 14:34.790
I guess I had the foresight to know
that this might come in handy.

14:35.374 --> 14:36.709
You kept so many records.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.087
Huh.

14:40.379 --> 14:43.507
This is Alex's background check from
when she first started at the DEO.

14:45.926 --> 14:47.803
Look at all those parking tickets.

14:48.345 --> 14:50.806
She's looked out for me for so long.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.893
I thought my leaving the DEO
would give her a break,

14:53.976 --> 14:56.020
but she's still protecting me
against Haley.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.397
Protecting you is in her DNA.

14:59.023 --> 15:02.276
Here's a transfer form
for aliens of unknown origin.

15:02.359 --> 15:04.111
Aliens called Morae.

15:04.695 --> 15:07.156
Morae? I've never
heard of them before.

15:07.239 --> 15:10.200
"Morae have
a natural cloaking ability

15:10.284 --> 15:12.036
useful for surprise attacks."

15:13.037 --> 15:14.121
Oh.

15:14.622 --> 15:19.710
Oh, it says they're invisible,
but I saw a shimmer.

15:21.378 --> 15:23.547
Maybe they're invisible
to everybody else except you

15:23.631 --> 15:25.007
because of your X-ray vision.

15:26.383 --> 15:28.302
-Uh...

15:28.928 --> 15:30.596
A General Alfonso Tan.

15:30.679 --> 15:32.264
I think I saw that name earlier...

15:33.390 --> 15:36.101
Where did I put that?

15:37.645 --> 15:38.896
Here it is...

15:41.106 --> 15:44.360
"General Alfonso Tan, chief
commanding officer of Project Morae,

15:44.443 --> 15:47.196
handed over control in 2012 to...

15:48.614 --> 15:50.491
A Colonel Randall McAllister."

15:50.699 --> 15:53.994
That's the guy who died on the boat.
So he does exist.

15:54.662 --> 15:56.121
This is proof that
there was a cover-up.

15:56.830 --> 15:58.916
The question is
why are they covering it up?

15:58.999 --> 16:02.795
I don't know. It was a top-secret
program, most of it's redacted.

16:02.878 --> 16:05.631
We should talk to General Tan.
He might be able to explain.

16:07.758 --> 16:08.759
Wait a second.

16:09.218 --> 16:13.138
General Tan and McAllister weren't
the only ones on this project.

16:14.306 --> 16:15.808
There's another name...

16:17.017 --> 16:18.644
Colonel Lauren Haley.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.361
Brainy, hey, are you okay?

16:27.444 --> 16:30.364
I was once interrogated
for 18 straight days

16:30.447 --> 16:32.992
on the planet Venegar
by Ik'Lofrai'iork,

16:33.075 --> 16:34.618
the emerald bloodeater.

16:34.702 --> 16:36.870
And let me tell you, Colonel Haley...

16:37.871 --> 16:40.958
would give that ten-eyed beast
a run for his money.

16:41.041 --> 16:42.626
But you didn't
tell her anything, right?

16:43.502 --> 16:45.337
Eh. There was nothing to tell.

16:45.421 --> 16:47.798
She just kept asking me
about Supergirl's identity.

16:47.881 --> 16:50.843
So, you used your brain
compartmentalizing thing with Kara.

16:51.969 --> 16:54.096
What does Kara
have to do with anything?

16:54.179 --> 16:59.268
Is this permanent or are you going to
remember that she's Supergirl soon?

16:59.351 --> 17:00.853
Kara?

17:01.437 --> 17:05.441
Your sister with the glasses

17:06.066 --> 17:07.443
Good one, Director.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.194
They don't even look anything... Oh.

17:10.696 --> 17:13.866
Yes, my compartmentalization
was on a timer.

17:14.074 --> 17:16.243
-Okay.

17:16.326 --> 17:17.911
Kara. Hey. What's up?

17:20.080 --> 17:24.460
Okay. I have to go.
Hey, uh, just... maybe sit down.

17:34.303 --> 17:35.804
Did Haley see you leave?

17:35.888 --> 17:38.515
No, she's too busy
interrogating agents.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.726
She's always so self-righteous.

17:40.809 --> 17:42.895
And if we find out that
she's been involved in this,

17:42.978 --> 17:45.105
I might not have to work with her
for very much longer.

17:45.189 --> 17:47.107
Let's just hope Tan has some answers.

17:47.274 --> 17:48.984
-Follow my lead.

17:51.987 --> 17:53.238
Tan. What are you doing?

17:53.572 --> 17:56.283
Henshaw
You need to leave.

17:56.366 --> 17:59.119
I'm Director Danvers of the DEO.
We have some questions for you.

17:59.203 --> 18:00.829
I'm not answering any questions.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.416
What is Project Morae,

18:04.917 --> 18:07.169
and why are you and Haley
covering up McAllister's death?

18:07.252 --> 18:10.255
It's top secret, Henshaw. That means
none of your business. Out of my way.

18:10.339 --> 18:12.299
You're not going anywhere
until you tell us what you know.

18:12.883 --> 18:13.967
If you want to get out of here,

18:14.051 --> 18:15.302
then you're going
to have to tell us the truth.

18:20.015 --> 18:22.976
Fine, we found the Morae as children.

18:23.060 --> 18:26.522
Their cloaking ability is beyond
any technology we've ever seen,

18:26.605 --> 18:28.273
so we took them and we trained them.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.858
Trained them for what?

18:29.942 --> 18:32.236
To protect our nation,
they're security assets.

18:32.319 --> 18:33.862
You mean, assassins?

18:33.946 --> 18:37.783
You trained alien children
to be killers?

18:37.866 --> 18:39.284
And they were amazing.

18:39.368 --> 18:42.871
Like no unit I've ever seen,
100% success rate.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.540
And now they're coming for me.

18:44.623 --> 18:46.959
-Because we tried to kill them.

18:47.042 --> 18:50.629
The President sent down the order
to cut ties with all alien personnel,

18:50.712 --> 18:53.465
so I gave McAllister
the order to neutralize them.

18:54.007 --> 18:55.884
The cargo ship was an ambush.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.262
Yes, but the Morae saw it coming.

18:58.345 --> 19:01.765
So, they fought back,
killed the SEAL team and escaped.

19:01.849 --> 19:04.810
But they were soldiers.
They were your allies.

19:04.893 --> 19:07.354
They're not human.
They're killing machines.

19:07.437 --> 19:10.691
-And they can't be contained.

19:10.774 --> 19:12.609
Do you see anything?
There's two of them.

19:12.943 --> 19:13.944
Oh, no.

19:14.027 --> 19:15.404
Stay here.

19:23.453 --> 19:26.832
Tan, we can
protect you. Don't run.

19:30.127 --> 19:32.337
Alex, stay next to me.

19:32.546 --> 19:35.215
Do you see anything?
-Just give me a sec.

19:49.313 --> 19:51.023
Okay, I don't see anything, can you?

19:51.106 --> 19:53.358
No. No, not even a glimmer.

20:04.244 --> 20:05.829
Tan, stop the car.

20:33.482 --> 20:34.858
Tan?

20:45.327 --> 20:47.454
-We're not here to hurt you.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.249
I'm an alien.

20:50.332 --> 20:53.210
I worked for the government
and they turned on me, too.

20:53.293 --> 20:55.671
But killing the people that hurt you
won't do any good.

20:57.130 --> 20:58.715
Let's get it back to the DEO.

21:00.300 --> 21:02.636
No, no, no.
We don't want to hurt you.

21:02.970 --> 21:05.305
No DEO.

21:06.139 --> 21:08.558
No Haley.

21:08.642 --> 21:10.018
No!

21:17.401 --> 21:20.112
-General Tan is dead.

21:20.195 --> 21:23.407
Tan is dead
and if you hadn't lied to me,

21:23.490 --> 21:25.033
we could have saved his life.

21:25.784 --> 21:26.994
What are you talking about? Project Morae.

21:28.620 --> 21:31.665
The Morae killed McAllister,
and then they killed Tan.

21:31.748 --> 21:33.417
Why are you covering this up?

21:34.960 --> 21:37.421
I'm not covering
anything up, Danvers.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.882
I haven't had anything to do
with the Morae for years.

21:40.966 --> 21:42.551
You expect me to believe that?

21:42.634 --> 21:45.512
You think I would knowingly
impede an investigation?

21:46.471 --> 21:48.348
I've never worked
with any Colonel McAllister

21:48.432 --> 21:50.726
and when Supergirl described
the aliens as shimmers,

21:50.809 --> 21:52.269
I took her at her word.

21:52.352 --> 21:54.938
Because of her X-ray vision,
Supergirl sees shimmers,

21:55.022 --> 21:56.857
while the rest of us see nothing.

21:58.608 --> 22:01.194
-Yes. Tan gave an order to neutralize them,
but they fought back,

22:03.947 --> 22:05.699
and they escaped.

22:05.782 --> 22:07.409
Now we almost captured one,

22:08.201 --> 22:10.037
but then it killed itself
at the mention

22:10.120 --> 22:12.247
of being brought back
into your custody.

22:14.708 --> 22:16.293
What did you do to it?

22:16.376 --> 22:18.462
Standard protocol
with tender-age aliens.

22:19.087 --> 22:21.715
Trauma as a method
of discipline and obedience.

22:22.549 --> 22:25.927
We knew that if they feared us,
they would obey us, and they did.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.095
What kind of trauma?

22:27.179 --> 22:29.890
Your sense of outrage
is misplaced, Danvers.

22:30.807 --> 22:31.933
They aren't humans.

22:32.017 --> 22:34.227
But they are sentient beings,
aren't they?

22:34.311 --> 22:37.272
I mean, they killed McAllister
and Tan for vengeance.

22:38.899 --> 22:41.902
I mean, none of what you done,
it strikes you as wrong?

22:41.985 --> 22:44.654
How do you think
we keep this country safe?

22:45.405 --> 22:48.700
Every soldier in every war has had
to do things they considered awful.

22:49.951 --> 22:51.453
Now this is reality.

22:52.079 --> 22:55.916
Sometimes reality is messy,
and it's... ugly and uncomfortable.

22:56.666 --> 22:58.752
And you end up doing things
you thought you'd never do.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.379
If what you're telling me
is true,

23:02.297 --> 23:05.550
the two Morae that are left
are going to come for me next.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.887
Prepare the DEO for an assault.

23:12.974 --> 23:16.436
Now, let me get right
to the purpose of this meeting.

23:17.521 --> 23:18.688
A meeting?

23:18.980 --> 23:20.857
Uh, I thought we were on a date.

23:21.775 --> 23:24.069
A date? This isn't a date.

23:24.569 --> 23:26.530
If it were a date,
we'd be doing something fun

23:26.613 --> 23:29.407
like paintball or an escape room.

23:30.075 --> 23:32.494
Well, uh, now I feel like an idiot.

23:33.078 --> 23:34.871
I'm just confused.

23:34.955 --> 23:37.332
I never thought
anyone as beautiful as you

23:37.415 --> 23:39.376
would be interested
in someone like me.

23:39.543 --> 23:43.630
Uh, well, I'm not sure that
I am interested in you.

23:45.006 --> 23:46.800
Clearly, I've made a mess of things.

23:48.093 --> 23:49.219
Not my intention.

23:49.761 --> 23:55.100
But the thing I came to talk to you
about today is important.

23:55.183 --> 23:56.852
Should... Should I proceed?

23:56.935 --> 23:58.895
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I'm curious...

23:58.979 --> 24:00.230
It's Supergirl.

24:00.939 --> 24:02.899
Since you're now using
your dreaming abilities,

24:02.983 --> 24:05.443
I thought that you may be
interested in joining her

24:05.527 --> 24:09.156
on her many crime-fighting
and/or planet-saving adventures

24:09.239 --> 24:10.657
as sort of a friend.

24:10.740 --> 24:12.450
A Super friend.

24:12.534 --> 24:13.535
Oh... Oh, um...

24:15.662 --> 24:18.123
Brainy, what happened
in Collinwood was...

24:19.332 --> 24:21.626
I... I think that was more
of a one-time thing.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.295
But you were so good at it.

24:23.378 --> 24:26.298
But I'm not even really prepared
to discuss this.

24:29.676 --> 24:31.678
I was on a dark path.

24:33.138 --> 24:35.640
I was arrested,

24:35.724 --> 24:38.560
and I was given a choice to change

24:38.643 --> 24:42.397
and to use my intellect
in the service of good.

24:45.650 --> 24:48.570
At first, I didn't want
the responsibilities

24:49.279 --> 24:50.906
or burdens of a superhero.

24:53.074 --> 24:55.285
But I did choose.

24:57.412 --> 24:59.164
And I haven't regretted it.

24:59.247 --> 25:03.585
You are a hero, I know it.

25:10.717 --> 25:12.135
I need to go.

25:16.473 --> 25:20.852
This binder contains
some costume ideas

25:21.561 --> 25:24.105
and some code name possibilities.

25:25.982 --> 25:29.611
Please think about what I've said.

25:35.867 --> 25:37.535
I can't believe
you're trying to make a soufflé.

25:37.619 --> 25:39.579
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa!

25:39.663 --> 25:40.956
Who is trying?

25:41.039 --> 25:42.290
I will have you know

25:42.374 --> 25:46.670
that I won the Kappa Pi Tau
bake

25:46.753 --> 25:48.255
Your fraternity had a bake

25:48.338 --> 25:50.006
Well, we raised a lot of money
for charity

25:50.090 --> 25:52.342
and technically it was a fratority.

25:52.425 --> 25:54.177
Co-ed. No house.

25:54.261 --> 25:56.054
Oh, God, you are such a nerd.

25:56.137 --> 25:58.223
Guilty as charged.
But somebody else is

25:58.306 --> 25:59.724
working on a science experiment

25:59.808 --> 26:01.643
when we're supposed to be having
a romantic make-up dinner.

26:04.437 --> 26:05.689
So, what's so important anyway?

26:08.608 --> 26:11.486
Okay, so you know how you said you
were going to be more open-minded

26:11.569 --> 26:14.155
about the things that I sometimes do.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.491
Yeah. And I meant that.

26:18.201 --> 26:20.495
Okay, so, I was using
a biolistic delivery system

26:20.578 --> 26:24.791
in order to rewrite DNA,
so I could cure cancer, ALS...

26:24.874 --> 26:26.418
Basically all disease.

26:26.501 --> 26:29.879
When out of nowhere,
I had a penicillin moment.

26:30.630 --> 26:31.840
It's a lucky break.

26:31.923 --> 26:33.758
And at first, I thought
it was just a side effect, that we had made
the heart invulnerable,

26:35.760 --> 26:37.804
but then I realized that
I could use the delivery system

26:37.887 --> 26:39.681
in order to enhance human powers.

26:42.267 --> 26:43.518
What do you mean by "enhance"?

26:45.437 --> 26:47.981
Do you remember the hypothetical
discussion we had at Thanksgiving?

26:48.064 --> 26:50.275
Yeah, about giving
humans superpowers?

26:50.525 --> 26:52.444
Strength, speed, invulnerability...

26:52.527 --> 26:54.779
-But that's impossible.
-Yeah, I thought so, too.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.034
Until I saw it with my own eyes.

26:59.617 --> 27:03.204
Wait. Hold on. Are you telling me
that you've achieved this?

27:03.288 --> 27:04.539
I'm close.

27:06.124 --> 27:08.793
Okay, and I know there are going to
be questions about its applications,

27:08.877 --> 27:10.670
which is why I was dying to tell you,

27:10.754 --> 27:12.005
because I need you, James, okay?

27:12.088 --> 27:13.423
I need you
as the angel on my shoulder

27:13.506 --> 27:15.133
so that I can determine
the right course.

27:17.886 --> 27:18.970
Wow.

27:20.013 --> 27:21.181
Do I have your support?

27:27.145 --> 27:28.772
-Yes.

27:32.650 --> 27:36.488
The building is hermetically sealed.
Perimeter alarms are active.

27:36.571 --> 27:39.783
If the Morae enter,
we will hear about it.

27:39.866 --> 27:41.451
So, what happens when they do get in?

27:42.285 --> 27:44.162
How do we see the invisible?

27:44.245 --> 27:48.208
Well, the Morae's natural cloaking
ability does not interact with light,

27:48.291 --> 27:51.711
however, we will flood
the corridor with mist

27:51.795 --> 27:54.589
and activate a grid
of light amplification

27:54.672 --> 27:56.549
by stimulated emissions of radiation.

27:57.425 --> 27:58.426
Laser beams?

27:58.510 --> 28:00.011
Good, you're familiar
with the technology.

28:00.136 --> 28:02.138
Once the Morae disrupt the lasers,

28:02.222 --> 28:05.475
I will fire at them
with this bad boy.

28:05.558 --> 28:06.643
Is that a paintball gun?

28:07.435 --> 28:12.023
Yes, which will be loaded with
these phosphorescent pellets.

28:12.107 --> 28:13.733
Once they are marked...

28:13.817 --> 28:16.820
That makes the Morae easy targets.
It's good thinking.

28:16.903 --> 28:18.196
Well, obviously.

28:18.988 --> 28:20.490
And of course, if all else fails,

28:21.783 --> 28:23.618
there's always Plan S.

28:26.079 --> 28:28.957
All right, everybody.
Set your stun guns to level four.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.708
That's just enough to injure them
so they uncloak.

28:31.251 --> 28:33.461
We're not using stun guns.
We're using real guns.

28:34.254 --> 28:36.089
The use of lethal force

28:36.881 --> 28:38.550
is against DEO policy.

28:38.633 --> 28:40.593
I'm sorry, Director, but those were
Colonel Haley's orders.

28:43.179 --> 28:45.890
After everything that happened
with Tan this afternoon,

28:46.224 --> 28:48.393
I was ready to walk,

28:48.476 --> 28:50.937
<i>but, out of duty, I stayed.</i>

28:51.146 --> 28:53.648
To protect her and this place.

28:54.357 --> 28:57.152
But, look, I can't work
with her anymore, Kara.

28:57.235 --> 28:58.278
No, I hear you.

28:58.361 --> 29:01.156
Look, we have
a completely different value system.

29:01.239 --> 29:03.658
I do not condone her methods.

29:03.950 --> 29:06.786
<i>I would give my life</i>
<i>to save this country.</i>

29:06.870 --> 29:07.871
<i>You know that.</i>

29:08.288 --> 29:11.624
But I cannot be part of a DEO

29:11.708 --> 29:14.210
that has someone
like Haley in charge.

29:14.294 --> 29:16.171
She has no morality.

29:16.254 --> 29:17.839
There's no line in the sand.

29:18.631 --> 29:20.091
I'm gonna resign, Kara.

29:20.175 --> 29:22.343
Alex, you can't leave the DEO.

29:22.427 --> 29:24.095
I can't stay here.

29:24.179 --> 29:26.306
You are its moral center.

29:26.890 --> 29:28.308
The agents need you.

29:28.391 --> 29:29.392
The country needs you.

29:29.476 --> 29:31.686
Without you,
Haley would go unchecked.

29:33.605 --> 29:36.775
Every time I see her,
I just wanna let loose.

29:37.233 --> 29:38.902
You would flatten her if you did.

29:38.985 --> 29:41.446
Then I would be court-martialed,
and she would win.

29:44.073 --> 29:45.200
I'm not gonna let her win.

29:45.742 --> 29:49.204
Alex, you are the most fearless
and determined person I know.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.123
<i>I'm sorry I can't be there</i>
<i>to do this with you.</i>

29:52.332 --> 29:54.751
Even when you're not here,
I know you've always got my back.

29:55.877 --> 29:57.837
Plan S. Always.

29:58.755 --> 29:59.798
Always.

30:14.979 --> 30:15.980
Colonel Haley.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.484
I'm so sorry, Director Danvers.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.362
You had me fooled, Danvers.

30:22.570 --> 30:24.072
I thought you were a soldier.

30:24.864 --> 30:26.282
But then I find this out.

30:28.409 --> 30:30.578
All the lies you must have told.

30:32.789 --> 30:36.876
You have undermined everything
that we stand for,

30:37.585 --> 30:40.922
all to protect your own sister.

30:42.924 --> 30:44.050
Supergirl.

30:53.393 --> 30:54.477
They're here.

31:00.233 --> 31:01.568
All right, everyone. Listen up.

31:02.735 --> 31:04.946
Everyone, lock and load.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.866
These creatures, they're hunters,

31:07.949 --> 31:09.868
and they will not hesitate
to kill any of you.

31:09.951 --> 31:13.121
The moment you see a disruption
in the lasers, open fire.

31:13.413 --> 31:14.789
All right, let's go. Let's go.

31:23.798 --> 31:26.050
Remember, there are
two Morae in the building.

31:27.844 --> 31:29.262
Easy, everyone.

31:31.598 --> 31:33.683
We should still see them
coming through the mist.

31:33.766 --> 31:34.934
If we have each other's backs,

31:35.351 --> 31:38.271
we're going to get through this.
Take them alive if you can.

31:42.483 --> 31:44.027
-Fire!

31:45.695 --> 31:46.905
Hold fire.

31:48.323 --> 31:49.365
Did we get it?

31:53.411 --> 31:54.579
Stand down, Danvers.

31:55.121 --> 31:56.247
Reiff.

32:16.351 --> 32:17.352
I got him.

32:21.397 --> 32:22.440
Over here.

32:29.322 --> 32:30.365
One down.

32:32.700 --> 32:33.743
Oh, sprock.

32:38.831 --> 32:40.792
Agent Dox.

32:40.875 --> 32:41.876
No.  It's there!

32:49.133 --> 32:51.803
Everybody, close ranks.
Help me get Dox back.

32:52.053 --> 32:53.137
Move. Move.

32:53.221 --> 32:54.263
Fall back!

32:55.932 --> 32:58.351
Do you see it?
I can't find it.

32:59.769 --> 33:00.812
It's behind us!

33:11.072 --> 33:13.032
No. Go. Go, check the agents. Go.

34:06.836 --> 34:07.879
You saved me.

34:13.676 --> 34:15.011
I know who you are.

34:16.846 --> 34:20.767
And from now on,
you will do exactly as I order.

34:21.142 --> 34:22.310
Exactly when I say.

34:23.478 --> 34:24.729
She just saved your life.

34:24.812 --> 34:26.606
Did I give you permission to speak,
Danvers?

34:27.440 --> 34:29.942
You're lucky you're not in handcuffs
for violating Article 90

34:30.026 --> 34:32.278
of the Uniform Code
of Military Justice.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.030
Your command is now mine.

34:36.199 --> 34:38.451
Kara Danvers' life is over.

34:39.160 --> 34:42.371
A member of the press working out
of a secret military operation.

34:43.247 --> 34:45.124
I'm going to
recommend to the President

34:45.208 --> 34:47.418
we immediately conscript you
back into service.

34:47.543 --> 34:49.504
And if you have
any reservations about obeying,

34:49.587 --> 34:50.588
you think about what would happen

34:50.671 --> 34:52.215
if your enemies found out
who you are.

34:52.548 --> 34:54.509
Your friends, your family,

34:54.592 --> 34:56.302
everyone you care about
would have a target on their back.

34:58.846 --> 34:59.931
I had to.

35:07.980 --> 35:09.732
-She found out.

35:10.608 --> 35:12.151
She knows I'm Supergirl.

35:14.737 --> 35:16.572
-We're okay.

35:17.031 --> 35:18.074
I did that.

35:18.866 --> 35:22.036
Did she tell anyone?
-No.

35:23.704 --> 35:26.749
-J'onn, we called you here because--
-You want me to wipe her mind.

35:27.333 --> 35:29.544
Yeah. Erase everything
she knows about Supergirl. Invading someone's mind
is a form of violence.

35:34.465 --> 35:36.926
I did it with Manchester
and I really shouldn't have.

35:37.009 --> 35:38.094
We'll find another way.

35:41.347 --> 35:42.390
I'll do it.

35:43.015 --> 35:44.350
Of course I'll do it.

35:53.860 --> 35:56.737
I didn't realize quite how permanent
that paint was going to be.

35:56.821 --> 35:59.699
Well, if this is the only lasting
damage from yesterday's attack,

35:59.782 --> 36:00.783
then I will take it.

36:00.867 --> 36:03.494
There's that
and I badly bruised my tailbone

36:03.578 --> 36:04.996
when I fell over the balcony.

36:05.830 --> 36:07.081
Is that why you're walking like that?

36:07.165 --> 36:09.083
-Ah, don't laugh.

36:09.208 --> 36:11.711
-My pain is at a seven.
Sorry.

36:12.503 --> 36:13.588
I'm sorry.

36:14.839 --> 36:15.882
What's wrong?

36:18.843 --> 36:21.053
I... I didn't know
they had those on Earth.

36:21.888 --> 36:23.431
It wasn't in the database.

36:23.514 --> 36:24.515
What is that?

36:26.100 --> 36:28.477
That creature is a Vertullarian.

36:32.732 --> 36:34.275
A Truth Seeker.

36:35.526 --> 36:38.279
Well, now that we're done
with the excitement from yesterday,

36:38.362 --> 36:39.864
we can carry on
with the investigation

36:39.947 --> 36:41.115
into Supergirl's identity.

36:42.200 --> 36:45.161
By the end of the day, I'll get her.

36:51.918 --> 36:53.878
There's no way
to deceive a Truth Seeker.

36:53.961 --> 36:56.297
It has one function, to expose lies.

36:57.006 --> 36:58.883
Anyone who knows
Supergirl's secret identity

36:58.966 --> 37:00.051
is at incredible risk.

37:00.509 --> 37:04.180
J'onn can't erase Haley's intention
of finding your identity.

37:05.181 --> 37:08.100
What we can control
is her access to the information.

37:08.476 --> 37:10.603
So we wipe the minds
of everyone at the DEO

37:10.686 --> 37:11.812
who knows I'm Supergirl.

37:12.021 --> 37:13.397
Just like with Haley,

37:13.481 --> 37:15.399
I'll go in and erase
every memory they have

37:15.483 --> 37:16.901
that connects Kara with Supergirl.

37:17.276 --> 37:18.402
Are you okay doing that?

37:19.237 --> 37:21.364
They've given their consent.
They want to protect you.

37:22.823 --> 37:23.866
Okay.

37:27.912 --> 37:29.455
I have to be mind-wiped, too.

37:29.705 --> 37:30.706
What?

37:31.582 --> 37:32.625
No, I have to.

37:32.708 --> 37:33.918
No, it's out of the question.

37:34.001 --> 37:35.836
Look, even if I could
beat the Truth Seeker,

37:35.920 --> 37:38.089
there'd still be a danger
that I would slip up,

37:38.172 --> 37:40.049
you know, with a text or just

37:40.508 --> 37:43.761
sharing information or simply
the fact that you are my sister

37:43.844 --> 37:45.054
and I love you.

37:45.137 --> 37:46.555
So, you'll be smarter
and more careful.

37:46.639 --> 37:48.849
If Alex's mind isn't wiped,

37:48.933 --> 37:51.602
there is a 100% certainty

37:51.686 --> 37:54.605
that Haley will still discover
your secret identity.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.990
I just came back from a world

38:04.073 --> 38:06.325
where you didn't know who I was.
I'm not doing that again.

38:06.867 --> 38:08.619
-There's no other way.
There is.

38:08.703 --> 38:11.205
You can quit. Just leave.
Get out of there.

38:11.289 --> 38:12.456
-Kara...
-Haley's not a danger to you

38:12.581 --> 38:14.458
-when you don't work there.
-I can't quit.

38:15.459 --> 38:16.711
You said it before.

38:16.794 --> 38:20.047
I have to stay
and I have to fight this from within.

38:29.432 --> 38:31.142
But who am I without you?

38:34.603 --> 38:37.189
The whole reason
I became Supergirl was...

38:40.192 --> 38:41.527
It was to save you.

38:44.822 --> 38:46.240
And I'm still gonna be the reason.

38:48.409 --> 38:49.702
I'm still gonna be me.

38:52.079 --> 38:55.124
And you're still gonna be Kara,
my sister.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.376
I just--

38:58.127 --> 38:59.628
I won't know that you're Supergirl.

39:01.464 --> 39:03.090
I'll have to lie to you every day.

39:03.174 --> 39:05.217
It's not a lie. It's...

39:06.093 --> 39:07.303
It's keeping a secret.

39:10.181 --> 39:11.640
And I'm giving you permission.

39:15.186 --> 39:16.687
Now let me save you this time.

39:33.621 --> 39:34.663
Hey, Maeve. What's up?

39:36.832 --> 39:39.502
Uh, yeah. Yeah,
I can talk about Mom's birthday.

39:41.921 --> 39:43.506
No. Uh, nothing important.

40:21.627 --> 40:22.670
You ready?

40:25.923 --> 40:27.383
Everything's gonna be okay.

40:29.927 --> 40:30.928
I can't.
