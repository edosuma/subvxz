WEBVTT

00:00.119 --> 00:01.319
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:01.398 --> 00:02.573
Do you remember that dream that we had

00:02.586 --> 00:03.880
when I graduated from vet school?

00:03.880 --> 00:05.125
Why don't we make that a reality?

00:05.141 --> 00:07.390
I want us to be partners.
I want us to work together.

00:07.424 --> 00:09.658
This is a working cattle ranch,
Jack.

00:09.685 --> 00:11.589
Where are we gonna put a
whole herd of wild horses?

00:11.610 --> 00:14.390
Those horses meant
everything to Will and...

00:14.490 --> 00:16.282
I'm not about to let my friend down.

00:16.293 --> 00:17.829
55 seconds!

00:17.850 --> 00:20.112
And that's your fastest time of the day,
folks!

00:20.341 --> 00:21.776
She's going to Europe!

00:22.062 --> 00:25.392
When I saw these trees,
I knew they were perfect for a swing.

00:25.470 --> 00:27.130
And this is the door...

00:27.210 --> 00:28.970
that we're gonna bring our
Christmas tree through.

00:28.997 --> 00:33.010
- Guess we're building a house.
- Lisa and I think that...

00:33.045 --> 00:35.980
well, since you spend so much
time in the house already,

00:36.000 --> 00:38.938
- you might as well move back in.
- Thank you.

00:38.985 --> 00:40.951
It doesn't mean a
weekend in the country.

00:40.965 --> 00:42.464
We can give him a home.

00:42.480 --> 00:44.677
So maybe we're asking
ourselves the wrong question.

00:44.688 --> 00:46.389
We should be asking ourselves

00:46.517 --> 00:48.853
if we have space in our life for Luke.

00:48.890 --> 00:51.413
- I think I do.
- I think I do too.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:12.853 --> 01:14.513
Look at the horses!

01:20.130 --> 01:22.122
Look at you! You're flying!

01:23.882 --> 01:25.381
Not too high, Luke.

01:25.648 --> 01:26.874
I won't.

01:42.816 --> 01:44.482
Attention all passengers...

01:47.590 --> 01:49.664
We are now boarding priority passengers.

01:52.220 --> 01:53.610
Can you believe it?

01:54.226 --> 01:56.360
We're standing in our
living room right now.

01:56.373 --> 01:58.320
- It's pretty amazing.
- Right?

01:58.980 --> 02:00.362
I'm gonna be looking at this view,

02:00.370 --> 02:02.229
drinking my morning coffee.

02:05.690 --> 02:07.541
- Hey, guys!
- Hey!

02:08.210 --> 02:10.298
So... progress, huh?

02:10.346 --> 02:13.010
Yeah, it's looking great, Lee!
I love it!

02:13.050 --> 02:15.110
Can you please let
your father know that,

02:15.146 --> 02:17.410
'cause Tim keeps coming
over and checking on things

02:17.416 --> 02:19.215
and giving me that uh...

02:19.870 --> 02:20.986
"look".

02:21.205 --> 02:23.402
Yeah, we know that "look".

02:23.690 --> 02:25.594
Don't worry about Tim, okay?

02:25.776 --> 02:27.410
Ty, we should probably get going.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.922
I still have a bunch
of horses to work with.

02:28.938 --> 02:30.805
- Right.
- So business is good?

02:30.880 --> 02:32.426
- Yeah.
- Better than ever.

02:32.464 --> 02:34.949
- Great news.
- Okay, guys, let's head out!

02:35.170 --> 02:36.917
- 'Kay. Thanks!
- See ya.

02:51.216 --> 02:52.516
Do you mind saddling the Paint?

02:52.533 --> 02:53.880
I think I'll start working with the Bay.

02:53.890 --> 02:54.592
Yeah.

02:56.085 --> 02:58.784
Are we expecting a client?
Whose truck is that?

02:58.980 --> 03:00.581
Ah, it's Kirk Jackson.

03:00.860 --> 03:02.725
What? No.

03:02.741 --> 03:05.024
His horse has a problem, Amy.
He's here now,

03:05.024 --> 03:06.666
- we might as well talk to him.
- I told you,

03:06.682 --> 03:07.600
I've got a gut feeling about him.

03:07.616 --> 03:09.706
- It's business.
- I know, but Ty, I mean,

03:09.717 --> 03:11.562
he calls at all hours
of the day and night.

03:11.573 --> 03:13.754
I tell him we're booked
solid and he doesn't listen.

03:13.770 --> 03:15.397
He just a total bully!

03:15.773 --> 03:18.074
We're not treating Kirk,
we're treating his horse.

03:18.474 --> 03:20.160
Okay? It'll be fine.

03:20.550 --> 03:23.322
Hey, Kirk! Sorry we've had
a hard time booking you in.

03:23.333 --> 03:24.965
Don't give me excuses.

03:25.546 --> 03:27.274
You've been ignoring my calls,
putting me off.

03:27.296 --> 03:29.250
No, that is not true. Like I told you...

03:29.269 --> 03:31.350
You know what?
I just took the bull by the horns

03:31.360 --> 03:32.272
and came over.

03:32.410 --> 03:34.298
Like I said,
I need you to look at Sarge,

03:34.314 --> 03:36.165
and I need you to do it now.

03:37.390 --> 03:39.306
And I told you that we are so busy

03:39.322 --> 03:40.368
with our other client horses,

03:40.384 --> 03:41.557
I couldn't possibly spend the kind...

03:41.578 --> 03:42.890
"Kind of time that you
would wanna spend with him."

03:42.901 --> 03:44.165
Yeah, I heard you the first time.

03:44.186 --> 03:46.149
Maybe we can book you
in in a couple of weeks.

03:46.213 --> 03:47.722
That's not soon enough.

03:52.844 --> 03:54.677
Whoa! Sarge!

03:54.693 --> 03:57.424
Easy! Easy! Calm down!

03:57.450 --> 03:58.453
Calm!

03:59.280 --> 04:00.869
This horse is crazy!

04:00.912 --> 04:03.418
He won't let anyone ride him!
He bites me!

04:03.605 --> 04:05.562
And I finally found some joker
who's interested in buying him,

04:05.573 --> 04:07.946
so I need him to rideable by next week.

04:08.060 --> 04:09.989
A week is not enough time, Kirk.

04:10.010 --> 04:11.200
Are you gonna take him or not?

04:11.210 --> 04:13.301
I'm sorry, Kirk.
We can't right now, okay?

04:13.312 --> 04:15.700
Just...
please, bring him back in a week.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.517
No. Forget it.

04:21.339 --> 04:23.402
I've had it with this operation.
Come on!

04:24.390 --> 04:25.008
Sarge!

04:25.018 --> 04:26.160
- Hey, let me help you.
- I got it!

04:26.186 --> 04:27.626
I'm fine, thank you!

04:29.810 --> 04:30.821
You know what?

04:31.210 --> 04:33.216
You guys have gotten way
too big for your boots,

04:34.282 --> 04:36.190
and it's gonna come back and bite you.

04:38.906 --> 04:40.336
It's gonna bite you hard!

05:25.059 --> 05:27.329
I can't even describe
how amazing Switzerland was!

05:27.344 --> 05:29.400
We traveled all over Europe, too.
It was amazing.

05:30.218 --> 05:32.992
Well,
I'm glad you had such a good experience.

05:33.143 --> 05:34.910
We did sure miss you.

05:36.610 --> 05:38.026
Look at all those guys.

05:38.148 --> 05:40.148
- Clients?
- Yeah, yeah.

05:40.165 --> 05:42.325
Amy and Ty, they can barely keep up.

05:42.390 --> 05:45.162
Great! Maybe I can help out.

05:46.666 --> 05:48.060
Good to be home!

05:49.930 --> 05:53.008
Georgie, tell me more.
How were all the other riders?

05:53.029 --> 05:54.448
Um, they were really nice.

05:54.469 --> 05:57.104
Most of them anyway.
There was a lot of stiff competition,

05:57.120 --> 05:58.608
but I learned a lot.

05:58.629 --> 06:00.997
Good!
And you must have had a really fun time

06:01.024 --> 06:03.141
with your mom and Katie the last week.

06:03.168 --> 06:04.581
- Yeah!
- I thought that you were gonna

06:04.592 --> 06:06.362
travel around a little
bit more with them.

06:06.384 --> 06:08.405
I wanted to,
but I needed to make sure I was home

06:08.416 --> 06:09.605
for Phoenix's flight.

06:09.632 --> 06:11.674
You can still help me pick him
up from the airport tomorrow,

06:11.680 --> 06:12.864
- right?
- Yeah, of course.

06:12.880 --> 06:13.888
I will make time for that.

06:13.909 --> 06:16.850
Oh good, lasagna. Again.

06:16.874 --> 06:18.768
A Lisa special.

06:19.270 --> 06:20.421
Uh, Tim,

06:20.757 --> 06:23.057
have to have a toast before we eat,
remember?

06:23.082 --> 06:25.712
Oh, right.
There's a, uh, order to these things.

06:25.733 --> 06:26.906
I forget. Toast!

06:26.928 --> 06:29.960
And eye contact. Wouldn't be a
good toast without a little...

06:29.970 --> 06:32.037
Eye contact.

06:32.432 --> 06:34.270
Welcome back, Georgie.

06:34.400 --> 06:36.282
- Welcome home!
- Welcome home, Georgie!

06:36.608 --> 06:37.546
Cheers.

06:38.597 --> 06:40.580
How's that house of yours coming?

06:40.850 --> 06:42.202
Well,
I guess you can't really call it a house

06:42.218 --> 06:44.010
since it's all plywood and concrete.

06:44.060 --> 06:45.973
- Dad...
- Well, I told you

06:45.978 --> 06:48.581
from the beginning...
gotta have the right contractor.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.053
And we have.

06:51.622 --> 06:53.788
- Don't give me that "look".
- The way that guy's going,

06:53.802 --> 06:55.290
he's not gonna have that house finished

06:55.301 --> 06:57.490
until Lyndy's ready to
move out and go to college.

06:57.546 --> 06:58.768
Right, Lyndy?

06:58.944 --> 07:00.630
I don't know how you
all are living together

07:00.640 --> 07:02.250
in that tiny little loft.

07:02.256 --> 07:04.530
Must be driving each other crazy.

07:20.016 --> 07:20.996
You know,

07:21.018 --> 07:23.008
I really hate to admit this,

07:23.264 --> 07:24.826
but I think my dad was right.

07:24.901 --> 07:27.381
We were naive to think the
four of us could live in here

07:27.392 --> 07:29.018
until our house was built.

07:30.100 --> 07:31.328
I know. It's been bugging me too

07:31.344 --> 07:33.130
that Luke has to sleep
in the living room.

07:33.146 --> 07:35.000
We have to figure out something.

07:35.024 --> 07:36.260
Yeah...

07:37.270 --> 07:39.056
We do. Amy.

07:40.117 --> 07:41.168
Look at this.

07:41.870 --> 07:42.837
Kirk.

07:43.670 --> 07:45.882
"Just experienced
the most unprofessional

07:45.888 --> 07:47.210
treatment ever.

07:47.560 --> 07:49.088
After a crazy wait for an appointment

07:49.098 --> 07:50.218
they still turned me away.

07:50.229 --> 07:52.058
They've obviously become a bit too elite

07:52.080 --> 07:54.280
for everyday folks with horse problems.

07:54.320 --> 07:56.150
I give them a big fat zero for service.

07:56.160 --> 07:58.290
stay clear of Amy and Ty Borden

07:58.309 --> 08:00.050
and their so-called business!"

08:03.693 --> 08:05.926
"Don't be fooled by this 'fake' service

08:05.946 --> 08:07.190
they're offering.

08:07.196 --> 08:09.396
They're inexperienced and flailing,

08:09.429 --> 08:11.430
not to mention, rude."

08:11.470 --> 08:13.477
So the guy's name is Kirk Jackson?

08:13.530 --> 08:16.122
- Yeah.
- I knew his dad.

08:16.439 --> 08:18.739
Did odd jobs around the rodeo grounds.

08:19.424 --> 08:20.778
Terrible guy.

08:20.890 --> 08:22.458
There's comments.

08:22.544 --> 08:23.648
"Thanks for the heads up.

08:23.669 --> 08:25.573
I was thinking of
taking my horse to them,

08:25.589 --> 08:27.750
- but no way!"
- Great.

08:27.930 --> 08:30.640
Amy, I know you're not
gonna agree with me, but...

08:30.890 --> 08:32.096
But what?

08:32.431 --> 08:35.001
I think we should take a step
back on this and take Kirk on.

08:35.008 --> 08:37.296
If he keeps this up, he could ruin us.

08:37.460 --> 08:39.727
Maybe he'll stop if we just ignore him.

08:39.749 --> 08:42.138
I wouldn't count on it. Take it from me.

08:43.100 --> 08:45.605
I just hate the idea of groveling.

08:46.030 --> 08:47.546
I hate the thought of losing clients.

08:47.568 --> 08:49.340
Yeah, because even though
you're doing well now,

08:49.349 --> 08:51.360
most small businesses
fail in the first year.

08:51.376 --> 08:53.445
So you don't wanna take any chances.

08:57.250 --> 08:59.173
Little bad publicity magically opened up

08:59.178 --> 09:00.512
a space, huh?

09:01.120 --> 09:02.437
That's good thinking.

09:02.780 --> 09:05.392
Anyway,
let's make sure we're on the same page.

09:06.154 --> 09:08.120
If your wife can't help me out here,

09:08.144 --> 09:10.229
I'm gonna have to get rid of ol' Sarge.

09:10.514 --> 09:12.044
One way or another.

09:12.230 --> 09:13.717
Right, boy? Huh?

09:13.744 --> 09:15.930
Is that meat truck gonna
come and get you? Huh?

09:17.665 --> 09:20.031
Oh, what? Is that too much information?

09:20.053 --> 09:22.208
You think he understands
what I'm talking about?

09:22.970 --> 09:24.117
No way.

09:24.838 --> 09:26.838
This horse is as dumb
as that hitching post.

09:26.885 --> 09:29.461
He needs to be told what
to do and when to do it.

09:30.100 --> 09:31.584
And that's your job.

09:32.470 --> 09:33.925
Let me know when you done it!

09:37.786 --> 09:40.290
Look,
I am only doing this for the horse.

09:40.314 --> 09:41.450
I know.

09:43.260 --> 09:44.325
C'mon, Sarge.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.858
Hey, hey, easy...

09:46.880 --> 09:48.341
easy...

09:51.970 --> 09:53.312
Come on, now.

09:53.800 --> 09:54.885
Ho...

09:58.469 --> 10:00.656
Let's try something else.

10:04.410 --> 10:05.994
All right, come on!

10:06.680 --> 10:08.279
If you wanna run, you can run.

10:08.288 --> 10:10.980
Let's go! Ha! Hey-yah!

10:11.360 --> 10:13.130
Hey, hey, hey.

10:13.706 --> 10:14.816
Come on.

10:14.988 --> 10:16.755
Let's go! Let's go!

10:26.632 --> 10:29.199
Yeah, you're watching. That's it.

10:32.140 --> 10:33.098
Hi!

10:34.540 --> 10:35.829
That's better.

10:38.110 --> 10:39.626
There you go...

10:39.978 --> 10:40.981
Come on.

10:43.260 --> 10:44.906
Good boy...

10:52.870 --> 10:54.181
Sorry.

10:54.326 --> 10:55.760
You still working with him?

10:56.608 --> 10:58.560
Yeah, but I gotta go
take Georgie to the airport,

10:58.576 --> 11:00.900
so I should probably put him
in one of those back stalls.

11:00.949 --> 11:02.670
Do you mind grabbing that shank for me?

11:02.725 --> 11:05.408
- Yeah.
- This horse is such a bully.

11:05.429 --> 11:06.469
He is just like Kirk.

11:06.480 --> 11:08.192
I've got ten other client horses

11:08.197 --> 11:10.261
that I'm supposed to be
working with right now.

11:10.282 --> 11:13.168
And I know it's not Sarge's
fault he is the way he is,

11:13.184 --> 11:15.110
so I'll keep working with him.

11:16.115 --> 11:17.381
Thanks.

11:19.120 --> 11:20.938
- Whoa, whoa!
- Ty, it's okay.

11:20.954 --> 11:22.138
Just let him go.

11:22.202 --> 11:24.560
Maybe the other horses will
teach him some manners.

11:30.900 --> 11:33.365
You drink too much coffee, Tim.

11:33.730 --> 11:35.717
Why don't you try some of this uh...

11:35.940 --> 11:38.986
nice organic tea of mine.

11:38.997 --> 11:42.320
It's really wonderful
for the digestive system.

11:47.810 --> 11:49.957
Nothing wrong with my digestion.

11:51.250 --> 11:52.672
Oh, I don't know.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.485
We share a bathroom.

12:00.592 --> 12:01.882
Please don't drink milk

12:01.914 --> 12:04.912
straight from the carton,
Tim, or wipe your mouth

12:04.965 --> 12:06.901
with a tea towel that I dry dishes with!

12:06.922 --> 12:07.941
Tim!

12:08.350 --> 12:10.298
I'm not asking, I'm telling you.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.202
You know,
you might've grown up on a fancy

12:12.208 --> 12:13.970
horse-breeding farm,
but you'd think by now

12:13.989 --> 12:16.208
you might've dropped some
of those airs and graces.

12:16.240 --> 12:19.770
Airs and graces?!
Oh sure, that is so me.

12:19.786 --> 12:22.746
- Airs and graces...
- I... I would say...

12:22.773 --> 12:25.320
that we need to get along.

12:25.344 --> 12:27.498
We're all under the same roof here.

12:31.120 --> 12:33.333
We invited him to stay, remember?

12:33.344 --> 12:35.888
I don't care.
I-I have tried to be patient,

12:35.914 --> 12:38.230
but I've just about had it
with this living situation.

12:38.250 --> 12:41.445
This cannot go on.
He needs to find his own place,

12:41.466 --> 12:43.802
and you better tell him. Now!

12:44.064 --> 12:45.413
I better...

12:45.418 --> 12:46.517
What?

13:01.350 --> 13:03.706
I needed a quiet place to have a coffee.

13:04.820 --> 13:05.904
You don't mind.

13:06.613 --> 13:07.570
Okay.

13:07.850 --> 13:09.914
So let me tell you about my roommates.

13:10.130 --> 13:11.658
It's true what they say about old people

13:11.669 --> 13:13.104
getting set in their ways.

13:13.221 --> 13:15.210
Everything's gotta be done just so.

13:15.226 --> 13:18.069
Especially Lisa. She's driving me crazy.

13:19.070 --> 13:20.981
There's not room in that
house for the two of us.

13:21.002 --> 13:23.968
Yeah, well,
try living in a loft with two kids.

13:24.240 --> 13:26.272
You should move back into the house.

13:26.710 --> 13:29.648
Well, you'd love that.
Even more people under foot.

13:30.050 --> 13:31.333
Nuh-unh. No.

13:31.354 --> 13:33.424
I'm tired of walking on eggshells.

13:33.950 --> 13:36.688
I gotta live on my own again.
That's the bottom line.

13:37.194 --> 13:38.890
But I don't know, how do I tell them?

13:38.912 --> 13:40.860
They'll probably be
insulted or something.

13:44.960 --> 13:45.861
Huh.

13:46.821 --> 13:47.957
Here's an idea.

13:48.600 --> 13:49.808
You should move back into the house,

13:49.824 --> 13:51.630
and then this place would be available,
right,

13:51.648 --> 13:53.354
and I could move in here.

13:53.910 --> 13:56.480
And that way Jack and
Lisa wouldn't be hurt

13:56.760 --> 14:00.048
'cause I'd be around.
I could... I could help them, you know?

14:00.069 --> 14:02.210
- Uh... I, I don't...
- No, that could work.

14:02.240 --> 14:03.546
I can see that.

14:04.140 --> 14:06.112
Like... bachelor pad.

14:08.550 --> 14:09.333
Right?

14:10.720 --> 14:12.240
Thanks for the coffee.

14:15.390 --> 14:16.458
It's okay.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.872
Luke, have you seen Tim?

14:20.260 --> 14:21.914
He was upstairs with Ty,

14:21.952 --> 14:24.160
but he left a few minutes ago.

14:25.740 --> 14:26.853
Oh...

14:31.210 --> 14:32.117
You know,

14:33.470 --> 14:36.394
I can't help but see the terrific bond

14:36.416 --> 14:38.810
between you and this horse.

14:38.837 --> 14:40.789
You must want to ride him.

14:41.360 --> 14:43.648
- I can ride him.
- Yeah? That's funny,

14:43.658 --> 14:45.590
'cause I've never seen you ride him.

14:47.141 --> 14:48.976
Swear you won't tell?

14:49.127 --> 14:52.027
Yes, I swear I won't tell.

14:53.330 --> 14:55.030
I love Boots

14:55.077 --> 14:56.618
and I wanna ride him,

14:56.834 --> 14:58.234
it's just...

15:00.005 --> 15:01.408
I don't know, I...

15:01.810 --> 15:04.165
You're scared. That's okay.

15:04.921 --> 15:07.809
It's good to have a healthy
respect for any horse.

15:07.845 --> 15:10.384
It's not respect; it's fear.

15:10.762 --> 15:12.992
'Kay, well, let me tell you something.

15:13.260 --> 15:14.858
I have made it my job

15:14.885 --> 15:17.962
to teach every member of
this family how to ride

15:17.978 --> 15:19.990
and you are no exception.

15:20.016 --> 15:21.620
Starting today.

15:22.790 --> 15:25.034
- Today?
- That's right, today.

15:25.077 --> 15:26.800
I'll tell you something else.

15:26.863 --> 15:29.130
No one, not one child,

15:29.141 --> 15:31.200
not one adult, has ever failed

15:31.226 --> 15:34.140
the Jack Bartlett cowboy boot camp.

15:38.874 --> 15:41.640
Now we already talked
about how you make him go

15:41.650 --> 15:44.010
and how you make him stop, right?

15:44.150 --> 15:45.130
Right...

15:45.253 --> 15:47.600
'Kay,
now I'm gonna stand in the middle here

15:48.151 --> 15:49.850
and you can ride around me.

15:50.850 --> 15:51.845
You ready?

15:52.656 --> 15:54.021
'Kay, kick him up.

15:57.240 --> 16:00.309
Yup. That's nice. That's real good.

16:00.474 --> 16:02.096
That's real good.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.946
Now, you can see I've still got him,

16:03.962 --> 16:05.770
so you're not going anywhere.

16:08.840 --> 16:11.589
Now you wanna be real
clear with the signals

16:11.600 --> 16:13.392
you give to your horse.

16:13.710 --> 16:16.544
Okay... What signals?

16:16.550 --> 16:18.490
Well, that's a good question.

16:18.780 --> 16:22.368
If you want Boots to turn,
you need to use your reins.

16:23.186 --> 16:26.020
So left rein for a left turn.

16:26.220 --> 16:27.760
And at the same time,

16:27.792 --> 16:30.362
give him just a little nudge on his side

16:30.368 --> 16:31.952
with your right leg.

16:32.130 --> 16:34.250
Left rein...

16:34.890 --> 16:36.421
right leg.

16:38.938 --> 16:41.792
You see, now there, I think you gave him

16:41.797 --> 16:44.400
a little too much
pressure with your leg.

16:44.573 --> 16:46.206
You gotta think of it as...

16:46.304 --> 16:49.317
the same amount of pressure
you use when you pet a dog.

16:49.480 --> 16:50.549
Come on.

16:58.086 --> 17:01.054
- You got this.
- No! I don't like it.

17:01.056 --> 17:03.390
Okay. Stay up there. You're all right.

17:03.408 --> 17:05.685
No. I want down!

17:07.099 --> 17:09.760
Fine. You want off, get off.

17:09.964 --> 17:11.830
I taught you how to dismount.

17:26.208 --> 17:28.520
Phoenix! Hey, bud!

17:28.528 --> 17:30.120
Easy... easy...

17:30.138 --> 17:31.354
it's okay.

17:31.620 --> 17:33.568
Dr. Sharma. I'm the resident vet here.

17:33.584 --> 17:35.320
Hi. Amy Fleming. This is Georgie.

17:35.344 --> 17:36.760
It's her horse, Phoenix.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.544
It's okay, we're gonna get you home.

17:39.327 --> 17:41.727
I'm sorry,
I'm afraid your horse can't go home.

17:41.749 --> 17:44.101
- Not yet.
- Why?

17:44.186 --> 17:45.936
There's been an incident.

17:51.930 --> 17:53.333
What incident?

17:53.360 --> 17:55.728
I'm afraid all three
horses being transported

17:55.738 --> 17:58.330
were exposed to a
contaminated feed bucket.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.394
Contaminated with what?

18:00.512 --> 18:02.789
The handler was in previous
contact with a horse

18:02.800 --> 18:04.730
with suspected equine influenza.

18:04.746 --> 18:06.581
But he's vaccinated for that!

18:06.624 --> 18:08.629
The vaccine only protects
against certain strains

18:08.650 --> 18:11.434
of the virus.
So your horse has to be quarantined

18:11.440 --> 18:14.154
for at least 21 days.
- 21 days?

18:14.218 --> 18:16.176
No! Phoenix is so stressed already.

18:16.197 --> 18:18.101
Amy, we have to do something!

18:18.630 --> 18:19.829
My husband is a vet.

18:19.861 --> 18:22.160
Could we quarantine
Phoenix at our ranch?

18:22.260 --> 18:24.058
I'm sorry, I don't think so.

18:24.340 --> 18:27.584
He-he has quarantined horses
for clients in the past.

18:28.260 --> 18:30.965
You understand I have to do
the necessary bloodwork first.

18:31.157 --> 18:33.264
And, of course, I need your
husband's credentials and proof

18:33.274 --> 18:35.648
that you have the proper
facilities to handle this.

18:35.925 --> 18:37.955
Otherwise,
I can't release your horse to you.

18:38.010 --> 18:40.405
I understand.
We'll wait for you to do the bloodwork,

18:40.421 --> 18:42.624
and I'll make sure to get you
all the paperwork you need.

18:42.640 --> 18:43.386
Okay.

18:50.360 --> 18:52.533
Thanks so much for doing this, Ty!
It means a lot.

18:52.554 --> 18:53.904
It's fine. I'm glad to help.

18:53.930 --> 18:56.000
All the horses are in the
field or in the back stall,

18:56.016 --> 18:57.792
so barn's clean and we're good to go.

18:57.813 --> 18:59.700
'Kay, great. Thank you, guys.

18:59.717 --> 19:00.981
Okay, honey.

19:17.340 --> 19:18.800
We need to talk.

19:19.637 --> 19:21.226
Yeah, we need to talk.

19:23.470 --> 19:24.778
I'm not quite sure how to say this,

19:24.789 --> 19:26.760
but I've been thinking about it a lot.

19:26.858 --> 19:28.293
What? What have you been thinking?

19:28.304 --> 19:30.100
Amy and Ty living up there.

19:30.197 --> 19:31.909
They shouldn't be living
up there in that loft

19:31.920 --> 19:33.870
with two kids,
crowded together like that.

19:33.877 --> 19:35.970
They should be livin'
in the house with you guys.

19:36.144 --> 19:37.540
That's what they want.

19:37.621 --> 19:39.301
They just hate to ask you and Lisa.

19:39.333 --> 19:41.285
Why would they hate to ask us?

19:41.312 --> 19:42.976
Oh, come on, they're embarrassed.

19:43.002 --> 19:45.066
After all you've done for them so far?

19:45.450 --> 19:48.310
But it's gonna be crowded in there too,
so...

19:50.634 --> 19:52.750
Well, with me living there, I think...

19:55.660 --> 19:57.520
I think I'm gonna move out.

19:57.590 --> 19:59.888
I think that I've been
a guest long enough.

19:59.904 --> 20:00.890
It's time.

20:02.882 --> 20:04.542
- Wait, are you moving out?
- Aw.

20:05.970 --> 20:07.770
Don't get your feelings all hurt.

20:07.786 --> 20:11.338
Well, where are you gonna go? I mean...

20:11.800 --> 20:14.373
You know you're welcome to stay.

20:14.389 --> 20:17.541
Ah, don't worry about me.

20:19.320 --> 20:21.632
Just don't say anything to Ty and Amy,
please.

20:21.648 --> 20:23.120
It's in confidence.

20:23.920 --> 20:25.488
So if you're gone,

20:26.510 --> 20:30.005
there is more room for
Ty and Amy and Lyndy,

20:30.026 --> 20:32.160
but there's Luke. What about Luke?

20:32.192 --> 20:34.530
Oh... right, Luke.

20:35.530 --> 20:37.482
Yeah, he wasn't part of the plan.

20:38.060 --> 20:40.144
Is he gonna be around here much longer?

20:40.500 --> 20:42.805
Well, it doesn't matter, he's here now.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.520
Well, let me think.

20:46.826 --> 20:48.510
Katie's got a big room.

20:48.549 --> 20:51.480
It's huge.
We could make that into two bedrooms.

20:51.546 --> 20:53.152
I could build a wall.

20:54.080 --> 20:56.490
See, Lyndy and Katie could
live in the one bedroom,

20:56.501 --> 20:58.580
Luke can live in the other one.
That's perfect.

20:59.550 --> 21:00.832
That's perfect.

21:17.640 --> 21:18.629
Hey!

21:20.610 --> 21:22.170
Get away from him! Hey!

21:27.380 --> 21:29.280
Hey! Go on! Shh!

21:29.333 --> 21:31.110
Get away from Champ!

21:34.990 --> 21:36.990
Hey, how're doin', boy?

21:37.990 --> 21:39.093
Easy...

21:49.470 --> 21:51.200
Easy, easy, easy...

21:55.610 --> 21:56.768
Easy...

22:01.010 --> 22:02.517
Oh, the gate.

22:06.120 --> 22:07.664
Where's Sarge?

22:21.100 --> 22:22.602
Ugh! Get away from him!

22:22.630 --> 22:24.469
Oh hey, hey. Easy!

22:27.749 --> 22:29.365
Ugh! Go on! Go on!

22:30.810 --> 22:32.640
Are you sure Phoenix
only had contact with him

22:32.650 --> 22:34.880
for a few minutes? That's all I saw.

22:34.901 --> 22:36.656
Just a nose touch, that's it.

22:36.698 --> 22:38.725
Okay. Well, like I said before,

22:38.746 --> 22:40.533
we're not gonna know for
sure that Phoenix isn't sick

22:40.544 --> 22:42.325
until I get the results
back from his bloodwork.

22:42.346 --> 22:44.197
So until then, we're gonna have
to keep a close eye on both

22:44.208 --> 22:46.053
- Sarge and Phoenix.
- So how am I gonna work

22:46.064 --> 22:47.866
- with Sarge?
- Let's not worry about that

22:47.877 --> 22:49.930
until we have to worry about that, okay?

22:51.216 --> 22:52.458
New subject.

22:53.172 --> 22:55.812
Lisa and I have been thinking.

22:56.797 --> 23:00.497
You kids are awfully crowded
up there in that loft of yours.

23:00.597 --> 23:03.578
Now wouldn't it be
better if you considered,

23:04.260 --> 23:05.077
well...

23:05.550 --> 23:06.864
Moving in here again,

23:06.864 --> 23:08.740
until your new house is finished.

23:08.797 --> 23:12.127
You two can take Amy's old bedroom

23:12.165 --> 23:14.800
and Lyndy can share with Katie

23:14.816 --> 23:16.858
'cause there's plenty of room in there.

23:16.976 --> 23:19.450
- Um...
- I-I agree that we're crowded.

23:19.461 --> 23:22.160
I mean,
we have talked about that for sure.

23:22.260 --> 23:25.200
But if we moved in here,
where would Luke sleep?

23:25.330 --> 23:26.660
Well...

23:28.100 --> 23:29.696
Can I be excused?

23:30.208 --> 23:30.954
Sure.

23:36.510 --> 23:38.725
All right, well,
here's the plan for Luke.

23:38.736 --> 23:42.501
I'm gonna take Katie's huge
room and turn it into two.

23:42.512 --> 23:43.984
I'm gonna build a wall.

23:44.180 --> 23:45.354
A wall?

23:45.650 --> 23:46.730
A wall.

23:47.220 --> 23:50.320
Okay. Well,
does that mean the loft will be free?

23:50.330 --> 23:51.850
'Cause maybe I could move in.

23:51.888 --> 23:53.744
Ooh! That's great.

23:53.760 --> 23:55.312
Then Luke would have a room,
we could all fit,

23:55.322 --> 23:56.896
and we wouldn't have to build a wall.

23:56.912 --> 23:58.560
Yeah, okay, okay, but...

23:58.630 --> 24:01.765
Dad, if we take over my old bedroom,
that kicks you out.

24:01.781 --> 24:03.546
You could stay in Lou's
room for a couple weeks,

24:03.562 --> 24:05.066
but then she'll be back, so...

24:05.093 --> 24:06.816
Well, actually,
I was kinda thinking about

24:06.832 --> 24:08.900
moving into the loft.

24:09.005 --> 24:10.835
Oh, well, you take it then.

24:11.910 --> 24:14.480
- You're sure?
- Yeah. Really. It's yours.

24:14.510 --> 24:15.770
I'll stay in the house.

24:16.050 --> 24:17.712
Okay then, I'll build a wall.

24:21.590 --> 24:22.629
Hey...

24:23.490 --> 24:24.352
Hey!

24:25.130 --> 24:27.290
Just thought I'd check on him,
take his temperature.

24:29.160 --> 24:32.149
Oh. Uh... is-is that normal?

24:32.186 --> 24:34.830
The froth? Uh, it's probably nothing,

24:34.949 --> 24:37.589
but I'll do a blood test and nasal swab

24:37.600 --> 24:39.344
and have it analyzed in the morning.

24:39.504 --> 24:41.464
He does have a bit of a fever, Georgie,

24:41.472 --> 24:43.370
but that just might be
the effects of the flight.

24:43.392 --> 24:44.501
Okay.

24:45.420 --> 24:47.146
Hey, it's okay.

25:04.260 --> 25:05.685
Who is that?

25:06.380 --> 25:08.773
It's from the airport vet office.

25:11.460 --> 25:13.664
They got the results
from Phoenix's bloodwork.

25:14.540 --> 25:16.170
It's not equine flu.

25:16.197 --> 25:18.325
He's been exposed to
vesicular stomatitis.

25:18.352 --> 25:20.110
That's a reportable disease.

25:20.138 --> 25:21.989
And that means...

25:22.550 --> 25:24.256
It means the whole ranch
is under quarantine,

25:24.277 --> 25:25.880
not just Phoenix.

25:32.060 --> 25:33.877
Yes, the ranch is under quarantine,

25:33.890 --> 25:35.130
but I just wanted to reassure you

25:35.152 --> 25:37.077
that your horse was never in contact

25:37.098 --> 25:38.064
with the affected horse.

25:38.074 --> 25:40.602
So what is vesicular stomatitis?

25:41.077 --> 25:43.322
It's a virus. It's extremely contagious,

25:43.344 --> 25:45.498
so you need to make sure you
wear gloves at all times,

25:45.525 --> 25:47.658
and if you're up close,
Georgie, you gotta wear a mask.

25:47.674 --> 25:49.970
Well, we're not quite
sure how it happened, Jim.

25:49.984 --> 25:52.346
It could have been a
handler not decontaminating

25:52.357 --> 25:53.680
a feed tray.

25:53.717 --> 25:54.885
How did he get it then?

25:54.901 --> 25:56.896
Do you think it was the feed tray,
like they thought?

25:57.310 --> 25:59.050
I don't know.
I talked to Dr. Sharma this morning

25:59.066 --> 26:00.533
and they're still trying
to figure out the source

26:00.544 --> 26:03.322
- of the contamination.
- Mrs. Grant. Please.

26:03.370 --> 26:05.066
We have it under control.

26:06.420 --> 26:07.930
The quarantine will be lifted

26:07.952 --> 26:09.685
two weeks after the last affected horse

26:09.701 --> 26:10.741
shows any symptoms,

26:10.752 --> 26:12.560
and then Goldie will be free to go.

26:12.581 --> 26:14.224
I'll give him some anti inflammatories,

26:14.240 --> 26:15.530
and a dose of antibiotics will help

26:15.536 --> 26:17.430
with any secondary bacterial infection.

26:17.461 --> 26:20.650
No, she's doing fine,
and we're keeping a close eye.

26:21.994 --> 26:23.258
I'm sorry too.

26:23.460 --> 26:25.738
The most important thing is we
keep the environment sterile

26:25.765 --> 26:28.032
and he has zero contact
with other horses.

26:38.890 --> 26:40.660
Hi. Look. Froth.

26:40.677 --> 26:42.320
Yeah, that's a symptom.

26:42.373 --> 26:43.621
I'll do the bloodwork.

26:43.680 --> 26:45.808
I was just about to call Kirk Jackson.

26:46.260 --> 26:48.805
Honestly, I don't know how
this could get any worse.

26:53.140 --> 26:54.670
Hey, Kirk. This is Amy Fleming.

26:54.693 --> 26:56.900
Can you give me a call as
soon as you get this message?

26:56.910 --> 26:57.738
Thanks.

27:00.810 --> 27:02.656
I guess I'll just email him.

27:03.480 --> 27:05.861
Look, we've done all we can, Amy.
All right?

27:05.872 --> 27:07.253
You let the clients
know about the outbreak,

27:07.274 --> 27:08.165
and I'm sure they're confident

27:08.186 --> 27:10.176
that we're gonna keep their horses safe.

27:10.420 --> 27:11.760
It'll be fine.

27:12.390 --> 27:13.888
- Okay.
- All right.

27:14.768 --> 27:16.920
I want my horse. I want her now!

27:16.930 --> 27:18.672
My daughter has a show this weekend.

27:18.693 --> 27:21.189
I'm sorry, Mrs. Grant,
but we can't let you take her.

27:21.418 --> 27:24.341
- The ranch is under...
- Quarantine! I know that!

27:24.357 --> 27:26.085
How did you let this happen?

27:26.117 --> 27:28.069
It was an in-flight problem, okay?

27:28.085 --> 27:29.552
A horse traveling from the Tropics

27:29.557 --> 27:32.140
had been previously exposed
to vesicular stomatitis.

27:32.154 --> 27:34.549
Now the palette wasn't
properly decontaminated

27:34.560 --> 27:36.042
before Phoenix was boarded.

27:36.069 --> 27:37.989
Now, a federal vet has
already come to our ranch

27:38.005 --> 27:39.650
and cleared all the
horses of any diseases.

27:39.674 --> 27:40.693
So far.

27:40.805 --> 27:43.765
I am horrified that your
horse was quarantined here

27:43.776 --> 27:44.848
to begin with.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.570
He should've been kept
in a proper clinic

27:46.586 --> 27:48.190
where he didn't endanger other horses.

27:48.202 --> 27:50.581
Mrs. Grant,
we have done everything we can.

27:50.592 --> 27:52.190
We have taken all the necessary steps.

27:52.190 --> 27:53.818
We have notified all the
pertinent authorities.

27:53.840 --> 27:54.954
- Doesn't help the situation!
- Look,

27:54.976 --> 27:57.354
I understand how upsetting this is,
okay?

27:57.365 --> 27:59.072
I get it, I do.

27:59.340 --> 28:00.912
Amy and I are gonna do everything we can

28:00.928 --> 28:02.458
to keep you updated on this situation

28:02.480 --> 28:04.928
every step of the way.
Please, believe me.

28:05.130 --> 28:07.024
I guess I don't have a choice.

28:07.670 --> 28:10.298
We'll be in touch with
any news that we have.

28:10.474 --> 28:11.322
I promise.

28:19.750 --> 28:22.544
Come on, Phoenix.
You gotta drink some, bud.

28:22.630 --> 28:23.866
Come on.

28:27.377 --> 28:29.507
And now he's got a blister.

28:31.420 --> 28:32.837
He's getting worse, isn't he?

28:32.869 --> 28:35.205
Georgie, we can flush his mouth
out with an antiseptic solution.

28:35.216 --> 28:36.666
That'll help the blister.

28:37.040 --> 28:39.808
Amy, uh,
could you just stand over with Jack.

28:39.978 --> 28:41.824
You gotta wear a mask
and gloves otherwise.

28:45.835 --> 28:47.435
This is all my fault.

28:47.670 --> 28:49.120
I was the one who convinced you guys

28:49.130 --> 28:52.122
to let us quarantine him here.
It was my idea too, Georgie.

28:52.181 --> 28:54.106
You just did that to
make me feel better.

28:54.128 --> 28:55.648
I should've let them
keep him at the airport

28:55.658 --> 28:56.554
like they wanted.

28:56.581 --> 28:59.349
He's gonna get over this, you'll see.

29:12.590 --> 29:13.456
Hey.

29:14.010 --> 29:15.360
What's up?

29:18.960 --> 29:20.400
It's Boots.

29:21.418 --> 29:22.948
What if he gets sick?

29:22.965 --> 29:24.000
He won't.

29:24.170 --> 29:27.749
As long as he's well away from the barn,
he'll be fine.

29:31.830 --> 29:33.354
He's just out in the field...

29:33.880 --> 29:35.034
standing there.

29:36.080 --> 29:37.440
Yeah, well,

29:38.460 --> 29:40.080
he's probably bored.

29:40.149 --> 29:42.266
Maybe a trail ride would perk him up.

29:42.288 --> 29:44.016
How can we go anywhere?

29:44.048 --> 29:45.482
The ranch is under quarantine.

29:45.504 --> 29:48.304
Oh, this is a big ranch.

29:49.170 --> 29:50.725
Anyway, I told you.

29:50.830 --> 29:52.021
I'm afraid.

29:52.074 --> 29:54.960
Yeah,
and I told you we'd get you past that.

29:54.970 --> 29:57.664
- I don't really see why.
- Well, I'll tell you why.

29:57.696 --> 29:59.637
It's
'cause anyone who lives at Heartland

29:59.653 --> 30:01.200
knows how to ride.

30:01.580 --> 30:03.594
Who knows how long I'll live here?

30:04.420 --> 30:05.984
My mom's gonna get better.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.445
Of course she's gonna come back,

30:07.461 --> 30:10.373
but you're here as long as
you need to be and want to be.

30:10.394 --> 30:12.437
- You know that.
- No, I don't.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.304
I heard Tim talking to you.

30:16.680 --> 30:18.064
About what?

30:18.112 --> 30:20.458
About Amy and Ty moving into the house.

30:21.290 --> 30:23.152
He wasn't sure where I'd fit.

30:24.260 --> 30:27.260
Well, you'll fit just fine.

30:28.830 --> 30:31.744
And while you're living here,
you are family,

30:32.200 --> 30:33.200
right?

30:34.600 --> 30:35.472
Come on,

30:36.700 --> 30:38.208
let's go for that ride.

30:46.880 --> 30:49.925
How stupid can you be, huh? Tell me!

30:49.962 --> 30:51.893
You let my horse come in contact

30:51.904 --> 30:53.370
with some incurable disease?

30:53.397 --> 30:54.890
It's not incurable, Kirk.

30:54.896 --> 30:57.320
- I'll tell you how it happened.
- I don't care how it happened,

30:57.360 --> 30:58.416
it happened!

30:58.930 --> 31:00.530
And now my horse is sick!

31:00.538 --> 31:02.260
Sarge is fighting it off, Kirk.

31:02.288 --> 31:03.829
He was in good physical condition

31:03.840 --> 31:05.200
when he came to Heartland, okay?

31:05.221 --> 31:07.630
He's doing a lot better than
the horse that was carrying it.

31:07.642 --> 31:10.346
Oh, that's supposed to
make me feel better, is it?

31:11.040 --> 31:13.045
I'm getting Sarge out of here!

31:13.920 --> 31:15.301
Open this gate!

31:17.480 --> 31:19.680
- Open the gate!
- I... can't.

31:19.717 --> 31:21.696
The ranch is under quarantine.
Sarge stays.

31:21.706 --> 31:24.450
No. No way! I'm so done with you guys!

31:24.474 --> 31:25.820
I'm taking him with me!

31:25.824 --> 31:28.090
I can't let you do that.
It's against the law.

31:30.960 --> 31:33.322
If anything happens to my horse...

31:39.030 --> 31:40.757
Why does he even care?

31:43.510 --> 31:44.970
You're looking good.

31:45.024 --> 31:46.840
- I am?
- Yup.

31:47.910 --> 31:51.380
You know, Luke,
I've been thinking about you

31:51.408 --> 31:52.858
and this...

31:53.050 --> 31:54.762
fear you have.

31:55.010 --> 31:56.922
I think maybe...

31:57.018 --> 32:00.150
you've been used to
looking after your mom,

32:00.170 --> 32:02.533
like it was your responsibility.

32:02.990 --> 32:06.384
And she's your mom
of course you wanna take care of her,

32:06.730 --> 32:09.973
but maybe - now it's just my opinion -

32:10.400 --> 32:13.300
but I think you might feel
like you need to control

32:13.317 --> 32:15.962
every situation you come up against.

32:16.192 --> 32:18.538
And when you can't control something,

32:19.210 --> 32:22.117
well, you kind of lose it, right?

32:23.340 --> 32:26.980
I think that's probably why
you're so worried about...

32:26.986 --> 32:28.380
about riding Boots.

32:28.400 --> 32:30.533
You don't think you can control him

32:30.937 --> 32:33.477
and that makes you feel
pretty darn vulnerable.

32:33.504 --> 32:36.390
You don't like to feel that way, do ya?

32:37.909 --> 32:41.190
I wanna help you see that riding,

32:41.269 --> 32:42.698
like many things in life,

32:42.709 --> 32:44.760
has a lot to do with trust.

32:45.760 --> 32:47.760
So I want you to do something.

32:48.770 --> 32:50.970
I want you to close your eyes.

32:52.540 --> 32:55.100
Go on. Close your eyes.
I'm right beside you.

32:55.110 --> 32:57.877
I'm not gonna let anything
bad happen to you.

32:58.410 --> 33:01.050
I want you to feel your horse movin'.

33:02.350 --> 33:03.786
'Kay? Here we go.

33:09.660 --> 33:11.050
Feel your horse movin'

33:11.060 --> 33:14.860
and feel the trust that
your horse has in you.

33:22.100 --> 33:24.130
He's okay with me, isn't he?

33:24.140 --> 33:25.541
Yes, he is.

33:26.470 --> 33:28.917
Boots doesn't want me to
be afraid of riding him.

33:29.290 --> 33:30.421
He wants me to like it.

33:30.448 --> 33:32.533
That's exactly right.

33:32.710 --> 33:34.256
See, you two have a bond

33:34.277 --> 33:36.810
and Boots is not about to break it.

33:40.620 --> 33:42.714
Okay. Yeah, thanks for letting me know.

33:43.150 --> 33:44.608
All right. Bye.

33:45.620 --> 33:47.136
What was that about?

33:47.390 --> 33:49.960
Caleb, he's at Maggie's right now,

33:49.989 --> 33:52.016
and, apparently, Kirk's going around

33:52.032 --> 33:53.216
telling anyone who will listen

33:53.232 --> 33:55.424
that we're putting our
client horses in danger.

33:55.680 --> 33:58.010
Kirk's blaming the
whole quarantine on us,

33:58.074 --> 34:00.490
saying we're killing his
horse and everyone else's.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.740
This is getting way out of hand.

34:03.792 --> 34:05.872
And you know what, Ty? I told you.

34:05.952 --> 34:08.739
I instinctively knew that we
shouldn't have taken on Kirk

34:08.773 --> 34:09.856
or his horse,

34:09.871 --> 34:12.330
but you didn't listen
and now it's a disaster.

34:19.159 --> 34:20.080
You're right.

34:21.659 --> 34:23.090
We shouldn't have taken him on.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.821
This is my fault, so...

34:28.469 --> 34:30.202
I know why we did it

34:30.639 --> 34:32.777
and I agreed to it too,

34:34.510 --> 34:36.351
so let's just move past this, okay?

34:36.368 --> 34:38.270
I'm-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

34:38.280 --> 34:40.780
Ah, you don't have to apologize, Amy.

34:45.880 --> 34:47.728
You should... Oh!

34:49.159 --> 34:50.681
I told Luke

34:50.699 --> 34:52.581
to keep this in the barn!

34:52.601 --> 34:54.297
Ty, hey, hey.

34:55.330 --> 34:58.437
Maybe grandpa's idea isn't so bad.

34:58.700 --> 35:00.460
We need more room, clearly,

35:00.490 --> 35:03.066
and I feel bad for Luke.

35:03.330 --> 35:05.072
He really should have
a space of his own.

35:05.093 --> 35:06.538
More privacy.

35:09.340 --> 35:10.618
Guess who's up?

35:14.210 --> 35:15.850
Hi, sweetheart.

35:17.621 --> 35:19.312
You wanna go see Papa?

35:22.820 --> 35:24.920
Yeah, you love your bunny.

35:24.944 --> 35:26.560
Yeah, you're right.

35:26.645 --> 35:28.920
We should take Jack and
Lisa up on their offer.

35:29.930 --> 35:31.088
Let's do it.

35:31.260 --> 35:33.600
Yeah, Tim can have his bachelor pad.

35:33.621 --> 35:34.880
His what?

35:35.370 --> 35:36.538
Those are his words, not mine.

35:36.549 --> 35:39.800
Oh, the thought of my
dad in a bachelor pad...

35:39.818 --> 35:41.500
Come on, let's pack up.

35:45.216 --> 35:46.965
This is all Heartland?

35:47.330 --> 35:48.186
Yeah.

35:49.160 --> 35:52.128
It's so big!
It's like having your own kingdom.

35:52.150 --> 35:54.192
Well, I don't know about that,

35:54.202 --> 35:56.298
but the family and the property,

35:56.325 --> 35:58.117
it goes back generations.

35:58.517 --> 36:00.290
Over a hundred years.

36:02.437 --> 36:05.221
Come on.
There's something I want you to see.

36:15.290 --> 36:17.637
So Georgie's still good with this,
right?

36:17.830 --> 36:19.354
Uh, yeah. But to be honest,

36:19.376 --> 36:21.434
I don't think she's
thinking about it right now.

36:40.230 --> 36:41.370
How's it going?

36:42.100 --> 36:43.658
Phoenix isn't getting better.

36:43.680 --> 36:44.928
He's worse.

36:46.140 --> 36:48.140
Well, he's hanging in.

36:49.140 --> 36:50.224
He'll pull through.

36:50.885 --> 36:52.442
You gotta hang in, too.

36:53.240 --> 36:54.277
Moving in?

36:55.010 --> 36:56.784
Uh, starting to.

36:57.650 --> 37:00.560
I hope you don't mind me
camping out down here.

37:01.163 --> 37:04.203
I've gotta be with him...
in case anything happens.

37:05.360 --> 37:07.626
No, I don't mind a downstairs roommate.

37:08.220 --> 37:11.630
And... Georgie, you gotta
put that mask back on.

37:11.653 --> 37:13.460
I don't want you catching this.

37:14.458 --> 37:15.626
Yeah, I know.

37:24.480 --> 37:28.160
Hey,
why don't you stay in the loft tonight.

37:28.176 --> 37:30.304
You need your rest. This is important.

37:30.871 --> 37:32.501
Well, if you're sure.

37:33.410 --> 37:34.389
I'm sure.

37:36.050 --> 37:36.960
Thanks.

37:38.150 --> 37:38.986
Mask.

37:45.130 --> 37:47.914
That's a big hill for
these guys to climb, hey?

37:51.700 --> 37:54.336
We'll just park 'em over here, Luke.

37:58.970 --> 38:01.605
Well, this is the family cemetery.

38:01.980 --> 38:03.061
Really?

38:03.510 --> 38:05.792
Your own cemetery?

38:06.120 --> 38:08.250
That's so cool!

38:10.550 --> 38:12.128
Finnamore Bartlett?

38:12.890 --> 38:13.882
Finnamore?

38:14.069 --> 38:16.220
Yeah. That was my great-great uncle,

38:16.234 --> 38:17.909
but everybody called him Finn.

38:17.936 --> 38:20.090
No surprise there, huh?

38:22.400 --> 38:23.770
Mary Bartlett.

38:24.100 --> 38:25.632
My great-grandma.

38:33.880 --> 38:35.240
That's so sad.

38:36.580 --> 38:38.282
She was only seventeen.

38:40.021 --> 38:41.317
Who's June?

38:46.850 --> 38:48.420
It's time we headed back.

39:04.610 --> 39:05.909
Hey, buddy.

39:10.010 --> 39:11.210
You wanna drink some?

39:11.338 --> 39:14.170
Come on, Phoenix. Come on, baby.

39:20.460 --> 39:21.690
Come on!

40:03.460 --> 40:04.672
Phoenix...

40:06.870 --> 40:08.470
You gotta get better.

40:29.722 --> 40:31.146
Morning.

40:36.369 --> 40:37.959
Oh man...

40:39.202 --> 40:40.972
this is really weird.

40:40.986 --> 40:42.309
It is, isn't it?

40:45.740 --> 40:47.392
We'll make it through this.

40:47.580 --> 40:48.666
I know.

40:51.580 --> 40:52.720
Amy! Ty!

40:54.790 --> 40:56.474
Hey, I think Phoenix is getting better!

40:56.490 --> 40:57.749
Can you come see?

40:58.290 --> 41:00.256
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

41:01.330 --> 41:02.485
Okay.

41:03.946 --> 41:06.288
You were right. The worst is over.

41:06.298 --> 41:08.613
Well, that is real good news.

41:08.910 --> 41:10.910
Looks like Sarge is on the mend too.

41:11.018 --> 41:12.986
Good. That's real good.

41:13.660 --> 41:16.160
Now, if y'all have a minute,

41:16.240 --> 41:18.901
there's something else
I want you to see.

41:24.118 --> 41:25.348
Good boy, Phoenix.

41:26.580 --> 41:27.946
Hey, Georgie...

41:29.326 --> 41:31.356
I was thinking that maybe um...

41:32.451 --> 41:34.781
well, if it's okay with your mom,

41:34.816 --> 41:37.552
that maybe you should move
upstairs into the loft,

41:37.568 --> 41:40.048
permanently. You know?

41:40.700 --> 41:42.581
You could use the privacy.

41:43.410 --> 41:44.773
And we all know that's
something you can't get

41:44.789 --> 41:46.261
inside that house.

41:47.410 --> 41:49.157
Really? You don't mind?

41:49.626 --> 41:50.517
No.

41:51.610 --> 41:52.858
Well thanks.

42:01.248 --> 42:02.122
Tim.

42:03.990 --> 42:05.018
Lee.

42:06.660 --> 42:09.104
Thought I'd let you know that
I'm gonna be living on site.

42:10.060 --> 42:10.880
On site?

42:12.074 --> 42:15.152
Yeah. In my RV.

42:15.660 --> 42:17.701
- Really.
- So I'll be around...

42:17.722 --> 42:20.885
just to watch everything you do...

42:21.030 --> 42:22.954
for the foreseeable future.

42:23.409 --> 42:27.379
- Just thought I'd tell you that.
- Great.

42:32.992 --> 42:34.492
Show 'em your stuff.

42:58.367 --> 43:00.767
Look, look. Look at Luke.

43:00.825 --> 43:02.895
He's doing such a good job!

43:21.780 --> 43:23.120
Way to go, Luke!

43:23.780 --> 43:26.144
When did you learn to ride, huh?!

43:26.330 --> 43:28.677
- Seriously, he is so good!
- I know!
