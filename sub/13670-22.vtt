00:01.000 --> 00:02.040
 'Previously
 on St Elsewhere...'

00:02.040 --> 00:05.080
 A resident of ours to do clinic work
 at Newcastle Penitentiary.

00:05.080 --> 00:07.160
 You start today.

00:07.160 --> 00:10.760
 You'll enjoy this,
 Mamasita.

00:10.760 --> 00:12.800
 What's wrong
 with my wife?

00:12.800 --> 00:14.120
 Nothing organic.

00:14.120 --> 00:16.520
 What's causing
 my pain?

00:16.520 --> 00:18.080
 Me.
 I'm the cause.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.480
 I'm not
 jeopardizing my life

00:20.480 --> 00:24.480
 because I feel
 guilty about leaving
 the backwoods.

00:24.480 --> 00:28.480
 Goodbye, Phillip.

01:54.360 --> 01:58.360
  SIREN WAILS

02:11.080 --> 02:13.320
 A full-term
 BOA infant.

02:13.320 --> 02:15.560
 Hustle him
 to the nursery.

02:15.560 --> 02:18.440
 How's tricks, Victor?

02:18.440 --> 02:19.760
 You're back.

02:19.760 --> 02:21.120
 Very perceptive.

02:21.120 --> 02:23.600
 I mean
 back for good.

02:23.600 --> 02:26.880
 Yep. Mom here needs
 a tear repaired

02:26.880 --> 02:28.800
 in the birth canal.

02:28.800 --> 02:32.000
 She fell over
 waiting at Logan.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.720
 Does Chandler know
 you left Mississippi?

02:34.720 --> 02:36.160
 I'll surprise him.

02:36.160 --> 02:40.160
 Grab my suitcase
 and purse.

02:44.160 --> 02:45.600
 I need that.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.000
 If I get a run,

02:48.000 --> 02:50.840
 then I'm on my way.

02:50.840 --> 02:52.080
 That's the ticket.

02:52.080 --> 02:54.480
 This is the last hand.

02:54.480 --> 02:57.000
 I'm due on the road.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.440
 I'm a hyphenate.

02:58.440 --> 02:59.920
 Today,
 good-looking orderly,

02:59.920 --> 03:03.920
 tonight and tomorrow,
 handsome paramedic
 in training.

03:04.360 --> 03:07.160
 You'll never
 make a living
 playing cards.

03:07.160 --> 03:11.120
 As my late husband
 Jacob used to say,

03:11.120 --> 03:12.360
 gin.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.400
 A penny a point.

03:14.400 --> 03:17.760
 You owe me $500.

03:17.760 --> 03:21.040
 Tomorrow
 double or nothing.

03:21.040 --> 03:23.280
 I may not be here.

03:23.280 --> 03:25.160
 Don't worry, Mrs G,

03:25.160 --> 03:27.120
 according to my research,

03:27.120 --> 03:29.520
 98.6% of all
 female patients

03:29.520 --> 03:32.160
 between the ages
 of 62 and 80

03:32.160 --> 03:36.040
 come out of
 a simultaneous mitral
 aortic valve replacement

03:36.040 --> 03:37.760
 singing and dancing.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.440
 You really know
 your medicine.

03:40.440 --> 03:44.440
 I just made
 the numbers up.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.520
 Forget the doctors.

03:46.520 --> 03:49.440
 You make me feel
 better, Luther.

03:49.440 --> 03:52.280
 I'll be back
 to visit you

03:52.280 --> 03:56.120
 before Dr Craig
 takes a crack
 at your chest.

03:56.120 --> 03:59.000
 Please do.
 You'll bring me luck.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
 And a knish.

04:13.400 --> 04:17.399
 Hi, cutie.
 Big day ahead.

04:19.279 --> 04:23.280
 OK, I'm finished!

04:23.280 --> 04:24.760
 Be more careful.

04:24.760 --> 04:27.640
 Yeah, one leg
 at a time.

04:27.640 --> 04:30.040
 Doesn't look
 straight to me.

04:30.040 --> 04:31.440
 Wear another pair.

04:31.440 --> 04:32.840
 Not on Tuesdays.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.600
 I got to get
 Barbara's stuff.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.840
 Want to eat out
 tonight?

04:37.840 --> 04:39.760
 I'm defrosting
 the duck.

04:39.760 --> 04:41.200
 Lame, Ellen.

04:41.200 --> 04:44.560
 No, actually,
 it's Peking.

04:44.560 --> 04:46.000
  DOORBELL RINGS

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
 Oh, he's here, Mark.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.400
 The kid's going
 to Clinton,

04:52.400 --> 04:54.320
 not to boot camp.

04:54.320 --> 04:55.760
 Six weeks, Mark.

04:55.760 --> 04:58.640
 The Galeckis
 can have the baby.

04:58.640 --> 05:00.560
 They're Barbara's
 grandparents, too.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.800
 Help me
 with this stuff.

05:02.800 --> 05:06.600
 No. I've got to get
 ready for work.

05:06.600 --> 05:10.600
 At least come down
 and say hello.

05:15.560 --> 05:17.000
  DOOR OPENS

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
 Hello,
 Mrs Craig.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
 Goodbye, Barbara.

05:37.920 --> 05:38.880
 Phil?

05:38.880 --> 05:40.320
 Over here.

05:40.320 --> 05:41.600
 Where?

05:41.600 --> 05:45.600
 Keep coming.

05:46.240 --> 05:47.360
 Oh...

05:47.360 --> 05:49.760
 You got to come
 upstairs.

05:49.760 --> 05:52.160
 I'm too busy
 correlating data.

05:52.160 --> 05:55.840
 I'm helping Craig.

05:55.840 --> 05:58.080
 Why didn't
 he ask me?

05:58.080 --> 06:01.280
 Maybe because you saw
 his wife's privates.

06:01.280 --> 06:03.680
 We're submitting
 our findings tomorrow.

06:03.680 --> 06:05.920
 That doesn't matter.
 She's back.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.360
 It does matter.

06:07.360 --> 06:10.720
 It will help me get
 my fellowship.

06:10.720 --> 06:12.120
 Who's back?

06:12.120 --> 06:13.240
 Roxanne.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.360
 Impossible.

06:14.360 --> 06:17.560
 You think I could
 be so cruel?

06:17.560 --> 06:19.960
 Roxanne Turner.
 In the flesh.

06:19.960 --> 06:23.840
 I don't want to worm in
 on your project,

06:23.840 --> 06:27.160
 but if you need help,
 just whistle.

06:27.160 --> 06:30.040
 You're that desperate
 to impress Craig?

06:30.040 --> 06:32.920
 No. I'm interested
 in the subject,

06:32.920 --> 06:36.440
 Whatever it is.

06:36.440 --> 06:37.880
 Roxanne's upstairs?

06:37.880 --> 06:41.880
 I knew reality
 would sink in.

06:49.840 --> 06:51.360
 "Nosocomial infection."

06:51.360 --> 06:54.040
 Yecch.

06:54.040 --> 06:56.440
 The next order
 of business...

06:56.440 --> 06:59.800
 A board of trustees member
 died suddenly

06:59.800 --> 07:03.640
 after enjoying a repast
 in his wife's boudoir.

07:03.640 --> 07:06.040
 What did he leave us?

07:06.040 --> 07:10.040
 It's the early bird
 who gets the Danish, right?

07:10.680 --> 07:13.560
 You guys really
 power them down.

07:13.560 --> 07:15.960
 Mr Taft designated
 St Eligius

07:15.960 --> 07:19.120
 to be the recipient
 of a building

07:19.120 --> 07:21.080
 at 3156 Buell Street.

07:21.080 --> 07:24.440
 He owned six co-ops
 on Beacon Hill,

07:24.440 --> 07:27.120
 and we get
 a slum toilet.

07:27.120 --> 07:29.080
 I'll miss the man.

07:29.080 --> 07:32.280
 Why? You treated him
 for 20 years.

07:32.280 --> 07:34.160
 He never paid you.

07:34.160 --> 07:36.640
 This is not
 the time...

07:36.640 --> 07:40.080
 Daniel,
 you all right?

07:40.080 --> 07:42.240
 Just queasy from
 the chemotherapy.

07:42.240 --> 07:44.200
 What about
 the building?

07:44.200 --> 07:47.040
 I'm going to inspect
 the property.

07:47.040 --> 07:50.320
 It's supposed to be
 a city landmark.

07:50.320 --> 07:54.320
 Excuse me. Donald,
 please take over.

07:55.080 --> 07:57.920
 If this building
 is a firetrap,

07:57.920 --> 07:59.680
 let's tear it down.

07:59.680 --> 08:03.360
 What about the people
 who live there now?

08:03.360 --> 08:05.600
 Sling your hash
 in another direction.

08:05.600 --> 08:06.600
 What?

08:06.600 --> 08:08.600
 Your community
 service programme.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.560
 The intention
 was good,

08:10.560 --> 08:12.480
 but the execution
 stinks.

08:12.480 --> 08:14.800
 Residents are
 on the street,

08:14.800 --> 08:16.680
 being robbed,
 blown up,

08:16.680 --> 08:18.600
 and Morrison
 came back

08:18.600 --> 08:20.800
 looking like
 an anchovy pizza.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.200
 Fertig, Donald.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.400
 Fertig?

08:23.400 --> 08:24.800
 Enough.

08:24.800 --> 08:28.120
 I'm well aware that
 my programme's failed,

08:28.120 --> 08:29.720
 all right?

08:29.720 --> 08:32.679
 I had to tell
 Jack's parents.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.320
 I put him
 on the plane.

08:35.320 --> 08:38.520
 Don't tell me I don't
 feel responsibility.

08:38.520 --> 08:42.520
 Which is why
 I move to postpone
 further assignments.

08:42.799 --> 08:44.600
 I'm finished
 sacrificing residents

08:44.600 --> 08:48.600
 so you can feel
 like Mother Theresa.

09:00.760 --> 09:04.760
 If I didn't say it,
 no-one would.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.280
 You two
 still together?

09:07.280 --> 09:08.720
 I'm not sure.

09:08.720 --> 09:11.920
 I haven't seen her
 in 103 days,

09:11.920 --> 09:14.320
 16 hours,
 and 12 minutes.

09:14.320 --> 09:18.320
 Roxanne...

09:19.760 --> 09:21.200
 Hey there, stranger.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.120
 I love your hair.

09:23.120 --> 09:25.520
 You look high-tone,
 girl.

09:25.520 --> 09:28.800
 That's what they'd say
 in Blue Creek.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.840
 Mail for Dr Turner.

09:30.840 --> 09:33.040
 Sorry things
 didn't work out.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.840
 They did. I found
 another doctor...

09:35.840 --> 09:38.720
 A good man,
 young and strong.

09:38.720 --> 09:41.600
 He doesn't mind
 the snail's pace

09:41.600 --> 09:44.000
 that was
 driving me crazy.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.920
 Blue Creek doesn't
 have the ballet

09:46.920 --> 09:48.800
 or Steve's ice cream

09:48.800 --> 09:50.840
 Or Phillip Chandler.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.480
 I was
 an insensitive jerk.

09:53.480 --> 09:56.200
 She wanted
 to help her people.

09:56.200 --> 10:00.040
 I said
 it was because
 she felt guilty

10:00.040 --> 10:03.720
 for leaving
 the backwoods.

10:03.720 --> 10:07.720
 I came down hard
 on Chandler
 for saying so.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.960
 I had a right,

10:09.960 --> 10:12.360
 but I was too hard.

10:12.360 --> 10:15.240
 Instead of talking
 things over, I left.

10:15.240 --> 10:19.000
 Since she left,
 I've been through a lot.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.880
 A pipe bomb
 makes you realise
 people are fragile.

10:22.880 --> 10:24.760
 I want to apologise.

10:24.760 --> 10:27.080
 I want to start over.

10:27.080 --> 10:30.360
 I'm ready to give us
 another try.

10:30.360 --> 10:34.200
 I spent many nights
 looking at stars,
 thinking.

10:34.200 --> 10:38.200
 I must've apologized
 over 1,000 times
 in my mind.

10:38.520 --> 10:41.360
 Do you know
 where he is?

10:41.360 --> 10:42.680
 Downstairs.

10:42.680 --> 10:44.560
 I'll go with you.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.960
 I'm a sucker
 for reunions.

10:46.960 --> 10:49.240
 Roxanne loves
 Johnny-jump-ups.

10:49.240 --> 10:51.640
 Those are
 footsteps of spring.

10:51.640 --> 10:55.480
 Whatever they are,
 I've giving them to her.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.040
 See you.

10:57.040 --> 11:01.040
  RAP MUSIC PLAYS

11:19.120 --> 11:23.120
 Fine weather

11:28.080 --> 11:32.080
 Good day.

11:55.920 --> 11:59.920
 Hey! Open this door!

12:03.440 --> 12:07.240
 Hello?

12:07.240 --> 12:10.080
 Hello.

12:10.080 --> 12:14.000

 You do the honours.

12:30.320 --> 12:32.240
 When did labour start?

12:32.240 --> 12:34.640
 It's not labour.
 She collapsed.

12:34.640 --> 12:37.040
 Severe headaches
 and blurred vision.

12:37.040 --> 12:40.480
 Bp's very high,
 210 over 140.

12:40.480 --> 12:41.760
 Are you sure?

12:41.760 --> 12:44.080
 I know my sphygmo
 from my elbow.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.080
 Are you on medication?

12:46.080 --> 12:47.880
 For high blood pressure.

12:47.880 --> 12:49.600
 Can't remember the name.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.520
 Propranolol?

12:51.520 --> 12:52.880
 Chlonodine?

12:52.880 --> 12:54.160
 Chlonodine.

12:54.160 --> 12:56.800
 Stop the pounding
 in my head.

12:56.800 --> 12:58.120
 I will.

12:58.120 --> 13:01.320
 First, an examination
 and a CAT scan.

13:01.320 --> 13:04.200
 Help over here.
 Exam room B.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.640
 Good people here.

13:05.640 --> 13:06.920
 Don't be afraid.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.320
 They'll take care
 of you.

13:09.320 --> 13:10.760
 Dump and run.

13:10.760 --> 13:14.760
 Want to hold
 her hand? Come on.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.120
 Why aren't you
 compiling data?

13:22.120 --> 13:24.680
 I wanted
 to welcome Roxanne.

13:24.680 --> 13:27.240
 Isn't publishing
 a treatise important?

13:27.240 --> 13:28.400
 Yes.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.240
 If you visit Roxanne,

13:30.240 --> 13:33.480
 you'll give her
 flowers and a kiss

13:33.480 --> 13:35.880
 and forget about
 nosocomial infections.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.320
 Quit fooling around.

13:37.320 --> 13:39.400
 You've got a deadline.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.800
 I need to see her.

13:41.800 --> 13:44.200
 I'll tell you
 a story.

13:44.200 --> 13:47.560
 Skimmer weekend at
 Penn, I met Ellen.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.480
 Love at first sight.

13:49.480 --> 13:50.920
 The following
 weekend

13:50.920 --> 13:53.320
 was an intervarsity
 boxing tournament,

13:53.320 --> 13:55.240
 so I laid low.

13:55.240 --> 13:58.600
 You took a dive
 in the fight?

13:58.600 --> 14:01.960
 Of course not,
 you moron. I won.

14:01.960 --> 14:04.320
 But only because
 I abstained.

14:04.320 --> 14:06.720
 Otherwise, I
 would've been weak.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.160
 Now get downstairs.

14:08.160 --> 14:11.520
 I'm available
 to help on your project.

14:11.520 --> 14:13.440
 Seriously,
 no jerking around.

14:13.440 --> 14:17.280
 I've been on surgical
 rotation for a week.

14:17.280 --> 14:18.240
 I've had
 no complaints.

14:18.240 --> 14:20.160
 I haven't done anything.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.400
 Exactly.

14:21.400 --> 14:24.800
 When do I
 get back in OR?

14:24.800 --> 14:26.240
 Check the board.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.120
 You're assigned
 to assist

14:28.120 --> 14:31.040
 with Mrs Griesman's
 aortic valve
 replacement.

14:31.040 --> 14:34.840
 Saving me
 for the big stuff.
 Shrewd decision.

14:34.840 --> 14:38.840
 Nobody else
 was available.

14:39.040 --> 14:40.840
 Dr Chandler.

14:40.840 --> 14:44.840
 Phillip Chandler.

14:45.200 --> 14:49.200
 He was here
 a minute ago.

14:51.280 --> 14:53.680
 How can I
 convince you?

14:53.680 --> 14:55.160
 I'm Dr Auschlander.

14:55.160 --> 14:59.160
 Please put
 that gun down.

14:59.520 --> 15:00.960
 Thank you.

15:00.960 --> 15:04.200
 Definitely too old
 to be a cop

15:04.200 --> 15:05.360
 and better dressed.

15:05.360 --> 15:09.360
 I'm chief of services
 at St Eligius Hospital,

15:09.480 --> 15:13.480
 and we've been given
 this building
 in Mr Taft's will.

15:14.200 --> 15:17.000
 Taft's dead.
 You're the new man.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.600
 Who are you?

15:18.600 --> 15:21.520
 OK, same deal
 as last time.

15:21.520 --> 15:25.520
 We don't bother you,
 and you don't bother us.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.280
 I don't understand.

15:27.280 --> 15:30.600
 We're a rock house.

15:30.600 --> 15:34.600
 You're our new
 business partner.

15:36.280 --> 15:38.680
 How many orderlies
 does it take

15:38.680 --> 15:40.800
 to replace
 a light bulb?

15:40.800 --> 15:44.800
 Hear about the
 resident whose lips
 were stapled shut?

15:44.920 --> 15:47.320
 I'll stick
 to elephant jokes.

15:47.320 --> 15:49.240
 What have you got?

15:49.240 --> 15:51.640
 Female, 23,
 with severe headaches.

15:51.640 --> 15:55.640
 Cat scan showed
 subarachnoid haemorrhage.

15:55.960 --> 15:57.840
 I'm not a neurologist.

15:57.840 --> 15:59.800
 Me, neither.
 Speak English.

15:59.800 --> 16:03.160
 She's pregnant.
 Her BP's 210 over 140.

16:03.160 --> 16:04.600
 She's having contractions.

16:04.600 --> 16:06.040
 That's bad, right?

16:06.040 --> 16:08.920
 Why isn't she
 on an antihypertensive?

16:08.920 --> 16:10.440
 She was. Chlonodine.

16:10.440 --> 16:12.320
 Why did she stop?

16:12.320 --> 16:13.800
 Makes her dizzy.

16:13.800 --> 16:17.640
 I started her
 on a diuretic
 and methyldopa.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.080
 That's good, right?

16:19.080 --> 16:22.120
 An angiogram
 turned up an aneurysm.

16:22.120 --> 16:23.880
 Damn.

16:23.880 --> 16:25.320
 What's that mean?

16:25.320 --> 16:28.200
 Shouldn't you
 be doing some work?

16:28.200 --> 16:31.560
 Fine. Next time
 you need a consult,

16:31.560 --> 16:33.480
 try and find me.

16:33.480 --> 16:36.360
 We'll prep her
 for a C-section.

16:36.360 --> 16:39.720
 Can't she handle labour
 with medical management?

16:39.720 --> 16:42.600
 Not without risking
 a serious stroke.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.960
 I'd better
 tell Mrs Ettings.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.400
 Deborah Ettings?

16:46.400 --> 16:48.320
 Yeah. You know her?

16:48.320 --> 16:50.720
 She's a patient of mine.

16:50.720 --> 16:54.560
 She came in complaining
 of an upset stomach.

16:54.560 --> 16:57.440
 I told her
 she was pregnant.

16:57.440 --> 17:01.440
 Now I got
 to give her bad news.

17:13.839 --> 17:16.720
 Thank you.
 What beautiful sun cups.

17:16.720 --> 17:18.119
 They're tiger lilies.

17:18.119 --> 17:20.520
 Actually,
 they're not for you.

17:20.520 --> 17:22.440
 Dr Turner isn't in.

17:22.440 --> 17:25.319
 Do you know
 where she is?

17:25.319 --> 17:27.720
 No. Doesn't
 she look fabulous?

17:27.720 --> 17:29.640
 I haven't seen her.

17:29.640 --> 17:32.040
 Too bad.
 Want a vase?

17:32.040 --> 17:33.480
 That'd be great.

17:33.480 --> 17:34.920
 I'd find one,

17:34.920 --> 17:38.760
 but I'm so busy
 with Nurse Papandrao gone.

17:38.760 --> 17:40.200
 Where'd she go?

17:40.200 --> 17:43.560
 Reef diving
 in the Bahamas.
 Nice life.

17:43.560 --> 17:46.920
 Hmm. Sharks, barracudas,
 moray eels. I'll pass.

17:46.920 --> 17:49.880
 That won't bother Lucy.
 Professional courtesy.

17:49.880 --> 17:53.880
 Hoo!

18:08.080 --> 18:09.080
 Ahem.

18:09.080 --> 18:10.560
 What is it?

18:10.560 --> 18:13.480
 You haven't said
 anything to me

18:13.480 --> 18:15.760
 except
 "more suction"

18:15.760 --> 18:18.160
 since Mrs Griesman
 rolled in.

18:18.160 --> 18:21.480
 That's because in
 this operation, you suck.

18:21.480 --> 18:24.000
 Back to the friendly
 banter of former days.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.360
 I've got other things
 on my mind,

18:27.360 --> 18:31.360
 especially Mrs Griesman's
 frozen valve leaflets.

18:32.080 --> 18:35.440
 I've gotten used
 to peace and quiet

18:35.440 --> 18:38.440
 while you
 were out of OR

18:38.440 --> 18:40.880
 let me thank you again

18:40.880 --> 18:44.240
 for inviting me
 back into the saddle.

18:44.240 --> 18:47.280
 More suction.

18:47.280 --> 18:49.680
 For crying out loud,
 see what you've done!

18:49.680 --> 18:50.720
 Me?

18:50.720 --> 18:52.160
 Her chest
 is still open.

18:52.160 --> 18:53.960
 Get her back under.

18:53.960 --> 18:56.240
 Your yackety-yakking
 slowed me down.

18:56.240 --> 18:57.640
 I'm behind Dakin.

18:57.640 --> 19:00.560
 Luckily, she
 didn't touch the wound.

19:00.560 --> 19:02.000
 Is she asleep?

19:02.000 --> 19:03.240
 Watch it next time.

19:03.240 --> 19:05.880
 Ehrlich, keep
 your mouth shut.

19:05.880 --> 19:09.880
 Reglove.

19:10.800 --> 19:11.520
 Still upset about

19:11.520 --> 19:13.200
 me giving Mrs Craig
 a pelvic exam.

19:13.200 --> 19:16.080
 Well, you keep
 reminding me!

19:16.080 --> 19:19.440
 Don't know why
 I thought about her.

19:19.440 --> 19:20.880
 Drop the subject,

19:20.880 --> 19:24.200
 or I'll drop-kick
 you out of here!

19:24.200 --> 19:25.600
 More suction.

19:25.600 --> 19:29.600
 Sucking, sir.

19:30.080 --> 19:32.800
 Here's the rent.

19:32.800 --> 19:36.800
 Pick it up, chief.

19:38.480 --> 19:42.480
 $1,500.
 Same as Taft got.

19:43.520 --> 19:44.640
 No.

19:44.640 --> 19:45.440
 Don't be greedy.

19:45.440 --> 19:48.040
 I don't want it.
 Good as anybody else's.

19:48.040 --> 19:49.480
 This is wrong.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.920
 So's cheating
 on your taxes.

19:51.920 --> 19:55.920
 I lose the franchise
 unless I move
 50 grams a day.

19:58.400 --> 19:59.840
 To cocaine addicts,

19:59.840 --> 20:02.400
 nothing matters
 except getting high,

20:02.400 --> 20:04.880
 and if they're lucky,
 there's withdrawal...

20:04.880 --> 20:06.280
 Tremors, hallucinations,
 screaming.

20:06.280 --> 20:09.120
 You blame bartenders
 for the alcoholic?

20:09.120 --> 20:12.040
 Folks will always
 hide behind some habit.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.440
 That's their trip.

20:13.440 --> 20:16.240
 I'm a businessman.

20:16.240 --> 20:19.640
 I think
 I'm going to be ill.

20:19.640 --> 20:22.480
 My life story
 making you sick?

20:22.480 --> 20:24.360
 No, it's
 the chemotherapy.

20:24.360 --> 20:27.800
 I have cancer.

20:27.800 --> 20:31.560
 So did my mama.

20:31.560 --> 20:35.560
 That's the one thing that
 really ever frightened me.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.960
 Cancer's bad to OD on.

20:38.960 --> 20:41.800
 How much life
 can you see

20:41.800 --> 20:45.360
 holed up in here
 every day?

20:45.360 --> 20:48.640
 The view stinks,
 but the pay's good.

20:48.640 --> 20:51.000
 Man's got uptown
 his way.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.920
 This is my opportunity.

20:52.920 --> 20:56.280
 When you're old
 and sick like me,

20:56.280 --> 21:00.280
 you'll look back
 and wonder what you
 gave to the world.

21:01.560 --> 21:05.560
 World's given me squat.

21:06.560 --> 21:08.440
 I was poor, too.

21:08.440 --> 21:11.240
 My people came here
 from Europe.

21:11.240 --> 21:13.280
 Couldn't speak
 the language,

21:13.280 --> 21:16.040
 suffered from
 prejudice, no jobs.

21:16.040 --> 21:20.040
 My father wanted
 a better life
 for his family.

21:20.360 --> 21:21.800
 He fought hard.

21:21.800 --> 21:24.160
 He worked
 in a sweatshop.

21:24.160 --> 21:27.120
 When the depression
 wiped him out,

21:27.120 --> 21:29.520
 he started
 all over again.

21:29.520 --> 21:32.360
 He had dignity,
 not like you.

21:32.360 --> 21:34.920
 Hey, I got dreams, too.

21:34.920 --> 21:38.560
 I don't plan on dealing
 my whole life.

21:38.560 --> 21:41.680
 My future's in music.

21:41.680 --> 21:44.640
 I don't know what,
 though, but...

21:44.640 --> 21:47.440
 Jazz...

21:47.440 --> 21:50.880
 Sax and horn
 trading fours.

21:50.880 --> 21:53.280
 The bass laying it down.

21:53.280 --> 21:55.640
 The drums backing it up,

21:55.640 --> 21:58.520
 and everybody's still cool.

21:58.520 --> 21:59.960
 You dig music?

21:59.960 --> 22:01.600
 Yes.

22:01.600 --> 22:04.600
 My tastes run
 to classical, though.

22:04.600 --> 22:06.040
 Yeah. Old stuff.

22:06.040 --> 22:10.040
 I got that here, too.

22:11.920 --> 22:15.400
 Charlie Parker, Bird, 1953.

22:15.400 --> 22:19.400
  JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS

22:26.000 --> 22:27.440
 Nice.

22:27.440 --> 22:29.120
 Check it out.

22:29.120 --> 22:31.640
  BANG ON DOOR

22:31.640 --> 22:33.120
 What's that?

22:33.120 --> 22:36.200
 Must be the cops.

22:36.200 --> 22:38.080
 See you later, chief!

22:38.080 --> 22:40.440
 All right,
 let's go, guys!

22:40.440 --> 22:41.600
 Hurry!

22:41.600 --> 22:44.480
 Up against the wall.

22:44.480 --> 22:48.480
 I'm Dr Daniel Auschlander
 of St Eligius.

22:53.080 --> 22:57.080
 Mrs Ettings' over here.

22:57.640 --> 22:59.080
 Dr Turner.

22:59.080 --> 23:02.960
 Thought you were
 way down there
 in Mississippi.

23:02.960 --> 23:06.280
 I ran back
 to deliver your baby.

23:06.280 --> 23:08.240
 Elliot, notify
 OR, NICU,

23:08.240 --> 23:10.600
 and find me
 an assistant.

23:10.600 --> 23:13.440
 Everyone acts
 like I'm in trouble.

23:13.440 --> 23:15.760
 I'll take care of you.
 I know that.

23:15.760 --> 23:18.560
 Being pregnant,
 people treat you nice...

23:18.560 --> 23:22.360
 Giving you seats on
 the T, holding doors.

23:22.360 --> 23:24.880
 Feel like a princess.

23:24.880 --> 23:27.240
 Is your husband home?

23:27.240 --> 23:30.120
 No... gone for good
 this time.

23:30.120 --> 23:32.040
 I don't know where.

23:32.040 --> 23:35.000
 How are you
 making a living?

23:35.000 --> 23:37.440
 I clean
 and fold laundry

23:37.440 --> 23:39.360
 for professors
 in Cambridge.

23:39.360 --> 23:42.840
 Hard for busy people
 to stay organized.

23:42.840 --> 23:46.840
 It's nice having
 a clean house.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.440
 Dr Axelrod says

23:48.440 --> 23:52.280
 you haven't been taking
 your blood pressure
 medication.

23:52.280 --> 23:53.720
 Makes me sick.

23:53.720 --> 23:56.640
 Not taking it's
 made you sicker.

23:56.640 --> 23:59.040
 Have I hurt my baby?

23:59.040 --> 24:03.040
 No, but we're going
 to do an emergency delivery.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.520
 Why?

24:04.520 --> 24:07.880
 There's a weak vessel
 in your brain.

24:07.880 --> 24:11.720
 If you go through labour,
 it could break.

24:11.720 --> 24:15.720
 The weak area's small.

24:15.760 --> 24:17.680
 After your baby's born,

24:17.680 --> 24:21.680
 we'll be able
 to treat your condition
 with medication.

24:22.120 --> 24:26.120
 I'd like my baby
 to live in Cambridge.

24:26.640 --> 24:30.640
 Not much chance, though.

24:30.920 --> 24:33.760
 Which is better,
 lasagne or beef?

24:33.760 --> 24:35.720
 Tastes the same here.

24:35.720 --> 24:37.120
 I'll have salad.

24:37.120 --> 24:40.520
 Could I go visit
 a friend upstairs?

24:40.520 --> 24:41.600
 Girl?

24:41.600 --> 24:44.800
 Lady. She's going in
 for open heart.

24:44.800 --> 24:48.800
 Sure, go ahead.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.760
  BEEPER BEEPS

24:50.760 --> 24:52.640
 She'll have to wait.

24:52.640 --> 24:56.640
 Let's hit the bricks.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.480
 Has anybody
 seen Roxanne?

25:06.480 --> 25:07.440
 Yep.

25:07.440 --> 25:08.880
 Me, too.

25:08.880 --> 25:11.680
 Why hasn't she
 tried finding me?

25:11.680 --> 25:13.600
 Maybe she's
 forgotten you.

25:13.600 --> 25:17.600
 She was with her
 ex-husband in
 the land of cotton.

25:18.320 --> 25:22.320
 Old times there
 aren't forgotten.

25:22.560 --> 25:26.520
 Anything that went on
 between them was fine.

25:26.520 --> 25:28.920
 Those flowers
 don't smell good.

25:28.920 --> 25:29.960
 Checker lilies.

25:29.960 --> 25:31.480
 They're sun cups.

25:31.480 --> 25:32.800
 They're checker lilies.

25:32.800 --> 25:35.560
 My grandmother
 had lots of them.

25:35.560 --> 25:36.760
 Are you crazy?

25:36.760 --> 25:39.320
 Those are
 footsteps of spring.

25:39.320 --> 25:42.680
 I'll tell you
 what these are. Dead.

25:42.680 --> 25:45.560
 Well, if this
 relationship is over,

25:45.560 --> 25:49.560
 I want to hear it
 from Roxanne.

25:51.560 --> 25:53.000
 Deborah Ettings'
 pre-op

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
 said you
 convinced her not
 to have an abortion.

25:57.360 --> 25:59.280
 She wanted the baby.

25:59.280 --> 26:03.080
 She wasn't sure
 she'd make a good mother.

26:03.080 --> 26:06.000
 I ask myself that
 question sometimes.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.440
 There's no guarantees,

26:07.440 --> 26:10.680
 but you don't know
 unless you try.

26:10.680 --> 26:13.160
 I really
 need your help.

26:13.160 --> 26:15.400
 It will be a do-si-do

26:15.400 --> 26:18.160
 between you, me,
 and the anaesthesiologist.

26:18.160 --> 26:20.560
 She's not getting
 a spinal?

26:20.560 --> 26:22.080
 Pentothal and nitrous.

26:22.080 --> 26:25.720
 But a general will
 depress the baby's
 metabolism.

26:25.720 --> 26:29.520
 I can't have mom risk
 a subarachnoid haemorrhage.

26:29.520 --> 26:33.520
 I'm trying to save
 two lives here.

26:35.880 --> 26:39.720
 I haven't seen an OR
 in six months.

26:39.720 --> 26:43.440
 The nearest X-ray machine
 was 125 miles away.

26:43.440 --> 26:45.480
 But I won't panic

26:45.480 --> 26:49.480
 Until after I deliver.

26:51.440 --> 26:53.360
 We're going to start.

26:53.360 --> 26:55.280
 Isn't there some way?

26:55.280 --> 26:57.640
 I want to watch.

26:57.640 --> 27:00.040
 As soon as you're awake,

27:00.040 --> 27:02.400
 I'll bring you the baby.

27:02.400 --> 27:04.800
 I want to see my baby.

27:04.800 --> 27:08.800
 You will. Go to sleep.

27:17.280 --> 27:19.200
 Is Mrs Griesman OK?

27:19.200 --> 27:20.960
 What's your concern?

27:20.960 --> 27:22.200
 She's a friend.

27:22.200 --> 27:24.600
 She deals
 from the top.

27:24.600 --> 27:27.640
 Well, it was
 touch and go.

27:27.640 --> 27:31.080
 Never got her BP
 back to normal.

27:31.080 --> 27:35.080
 We won't know
 till morning.

27:35.440 --> 27:38.000
 I let Mrs G down.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.400
 What are you
 talking about?

27:40.400 --> 27:43.800
 I promised I'd come by
 before surgery.

27:43.800 --> 27:47.600
 Oh, well, next time
 I'll rearrange my life

27:47.600 --> 27:49.520
 to fit your schedule.

27:49.520 --> 27:53.520
 You can apologize
 to her later.

28:02.640 --> 28:06.640
 "Blood stains the roots
 of the palm trees
 of Venice.

28:07.400 --> 28:10.280
 "Bloody-red sun
 of fantastic LA."

28:10.280 --> 28:11.760
 Hi, Victor.

28:11.760 --> 28:12.840
 Elliot.

28:12.840 --> 28:15.760
 Tell them about your
 serum hepatitis?

28:15.760 --> 28:17.200
 He's just kidding.

28:17.200 --> 28:21.200
 Getting on Westphall's
 good side by supporting
 the blood drive?

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
 Actually, I came
 for a sandwich.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.400
 Fiscus got
 the last one.

28:27.400 --> 28:31.400
 I came down here
 to cheer myself up.

28:31.400 --> 28:33.640
 Giving blood
 terrifies you.

28:33.640 --> 28:35.080
 But Craig's worse.

28:35.080 --> 28:37.640
 He asked me into OR,

28:37.640 --> 28:40.640
 then acted like
 I didn't exist.

28:40.640 --> 28:43.560
 I'm worried about
 next year's cuts.

28:43.560 --> 28:47.560
 I know. I've got
 first-year boards soon.

28:47.560 --> 28:50.920
 Could be lots
 of new faces around.

28:50.920 --> 28:53.800
 Guess we can
 assume Boomer's out.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.720
 Have you seen him?

28:55.720 --> 28:59.720
 Westphall escorted
 Jack to the airport.

29:00.280 --> 29:04.280
 Wow. I feel bad. I made
 all those jokes about him.

29:04.520 --> 29:05.960
 It's OK, Elliot.

29:05.960 --> 29:08.800
 You said those nasty
 things fraternally

29:08.800 --> 29:11.200
 to ease Jack's
 troubled mind.

29:11.200 --> 29:15.200
 Besides, your jokes
 weren't very good.

29:21.800 --> 29:22.920
 Nice.

29:22.920 --> 29:24.040
 What?

29:24.040 --> 29:26.520
 This.

29:26.520 --> 29:28.040
 The duck?

29:28.040 --> 29:30.440
 No. The two of us.

29:30.440 --> 29:34.440
 I used to take it
 for granted before.

29:36.640 --> 29:40.640
 Now I realise...

29:41.440 --> 29:42.400
 Tough.

29:42.400 --> 29:44.640
 It's hard
 for me, too.

29:44.640 --> 29:46.240
 Dr Weiss says...

29:46.240 --> 29:47.840
 No, no, no.

29:47.840 --> 29:51.200
 The duck...
 Overcooked.

29:51.200 --> 29:52.320
 Sorry.

29:52.320 --> 29:56.320
 Maybe this weekend
 we'll go out.

29:57.440 --> 29:58.560
 Out?

29:58.560 --> 30:00.000
 Away.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.680
 Or to a concert.

30:03.680 --> 30:05.920
 OK.

30:05.920 --> 30:07.920
 Which?

30:07.920 --> 30:10.680
 Either.

30:10.680 --> 30:14.360
 I'll get tickets.

30:14.360 --> 30:16.760
 Larysa and Regis
 got a divorce.

30:16.760 --> 30:19.120
 Weren't they
 on vacation together?

30:19.120 --> 30:23.120
 He's scum.

30:27.480 --> 30:30.360
 Yeah, we'll go out.

30:30.360 --> 30:31.880
 Friday?

30:31.880 --> 30:34.840
 Or Saturday.

30:34.840 --> 30:36.760
  PHONE RINGS

30:36.760 --> 30:39.240
 I'll get it.

30:39.240 --> 30:41.120
 Maybe it's
 the Galeckis.

30:41.120 --> 30:45.120
 About time.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.560
 Hello.

30:48.560 --> 30:52.560
 Yes.

30:53.360 --> 30:57.200
 Mm-hmm.

30:57.200 --> 31:01.200
 Uh-huh.
 I'll be right over.

31:03.120 --> 31:04.720
 Patient?

31:04.720 --> 31:08.120
 Daniel.

31:08.120 --> 31:10.000
 Dead.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.440
 Worse. In jail.

31:11.440 --> 31:14.000
 Got to bail him out.

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
 Don't wait up.

31:39.400 --> 31:43.400
 Hey.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
 Deborah.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.560
 Deborah.

31:50.560 --> 31:53.040
 My baby,
 where's my baby?

31:53.040 --> 31:54.800
 They're bringing her in.

31:54.800 --> 31:56.400
 A daughter?

31:56.400 --> 31:59.800
 She's beautiful.
 Seven pounds, four ounces.

31:59.800 --> 32:02.200
 She's got long,
 delicate fingers

32:02.200 --> 32:04.600
 and a head of hair.

32:04.600 --> 32:06.000
 Thank you.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.960
 How do you feel?

32:07.960 --> 32:10.440
 Wish these headaches
 would stop.

32:10.440 --> 32:11.880
 Blood pressure's
 normal.

32:11.880 --> 32:14.520
 The pain should
 stop soon.

32:14.520 --> 32:16.120
 So sleepy.

32:16.120 --> 32:20.120
 I'll go see
 what's taking so long.

32:32.200 --> 32:35.600
 Is the Ettings baby
 on her way?

32:35.600 --> 32:38.000
 Roxanne. How's
 Deborah doing?

32:38.000 --> 32:40.400
 I just checked.
 Bp's down.

32:40.400 --> 32:44.400
 Sweet woman.

32:46.600 --> 32:50.000
 Was Thomas Wolfe right
 about going home?

32:50.000 --> 32:53.800
 Strange. Everybody who
 knew me as a child,

32:53.800 --> 32:57.640
 when I was singing
 in the church choir

32:57.640 --> 32:59.080
 and stealing peaches.

32:59.080 --> 33:01.000
 Here I'm telling them

33:01.000 --> 33:03.400
 how to care
 for themselves.

33:03.400 --> 33:05.800
 Look. Here's
 the Logan baby.

33:05.800 --> 33:09.000
 Born on a luggage
 carousel.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.920
 How are you doing?

33:10.920 --> 33:13.320
 Did they listen to you?

33:13.320 --> 33:14.440
 No.

33:14.440 --> 33:17.800
 Ah, here's little
 Miss Ettings.

33:17.800 --> 33:19.720
 But what's worse is

33:19.720 --> 33:23.720
 I stopped trying
 to be a doctor.

33:26.440 --> 33:30.440
 I started acting
 like everyone's
 sweet little girl again.

33:30.720 --> 33:32.640
 Old habits return easy.

33:32.640 --> 33:33.600
 Yeah.

33:33.600 --> 33:37.600
 See you.

33:40.960 --> 33:42.880
 Oh, my God. No.

33:42.880 --> 33:46.720
 I was only gone a minute.
 What happened?

33:46.720 --> 33:50.080
 Must've been the aneurysm
 in her brain.

33:50.080 --> 33:54.080
 Vessel finally burst.
 Didn't even have time
 to defib.

33:54.400 --> 33:58.400
 Sorry, Dr Turner.

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
 You were supposed
 to see your baby.

34:13.880 --> 34:17.880
 I don't even know
 her name.

34:25.719 --> 34:29.719
 Judge Farnham got the DA
 to drop the charges.

34:30.040 --> 34:32.520
 One wallet.
 Check the contents.

34:32.520 --> 34:35.400
 How could they doubt
 my innocence?

34:35.400 --> 34:38.280
 You had $1,500
 in marked bills.

34:38.280 --> 34:41.080
 One comb,
 an embroidered
 handkerchief.

34:41.080 --> 34:43.600
 That was
 the rent money.

34:43.600 --> 34:45.040
 Officer, tell me,

34:45.040 --> 34:49.040
 do I look like
 a drug user to you?

34:49.440 --> 34:51.800
 Caught a guy, 85.

34:51.800 --> 34:53.239
 Let's go.

34:53.239 --> 34:56.600
 Last item, one
 Bulova watch.
 Runs slow.

34:56.600 --> 34:59.920
 Have a nice day.

34:59.920 --> 35:01.360
 Couldn't reach
 Katharine.

35:01.360 --> 35:03.280
 Thank you
 for coming.

35:03.280 --> 35:06.160
 Sorry to disturb
 you and Ellen.

35:06.160 --> 35:08.560
 You ruined
 our night alone.

35:08.560 --> 35:11.920
 The building's
 rid of that drug pusher.

35:11.920 --> 35:13.360
 Yo, chief!

35:13.360 --> 35:15.280
 Hey,
 you feeling better?

35:15.280 --> 35:16.720
 Yes.

35:16.720 --> 35:19.160
 I don't know
 where I'll be,

35:19.160 --> 35:22.000
 but if you're
 in the neighbourhood,

35:22.000 --> 35:25.360
 stop by, and we'll
 spin some tunes.

35:25.360 --> 35:27.240
 Friend of yours,
 mugs?

35:27.240 --> 35:31.240
 An acquaintance.

35:32.320 --> 35:34.720
 Nurse Rosenthal.
 How's Mrs Griesman?

35:34.720 --> 35:38.080
 Not so good.
 If she makes it
 through the night,

35:38.080 --> 35:40.480
 there's a chance
 she'll improve.

35:40.480 --> 35:42.880
 Dr Westphall
 in his office?

35:42.880 --> 35:46.880
 How should I know?

35:50.760 --> 35:52.720
 So? So?
 How's Roxanne?

35:52.720 --> 35:55.560
 Everything I said
 she was, right?

35:55.560 --> 35:58.920
 I gave up trying
 to find her.

35:58.920 --> 36:01.320
 She must be
 ditching you.

36:01.320 --> 36:02.760
 Not now, Ehrlich.

36:02.760 --> 36:06.280
 Craig wants
 this information
 in the morning.

36:06.280 --> 36:08.160
 Uh-oh, you
 misspelled pleurisy.

36:08.160 --> 36:11.080
 Of course,
 who can blame you?

36:11.080 --> 36:14.920
 Excessive testosterone
 build-up is affecting
 your spelling.

36:14.920 --> 36:17.320
 Whenever my tailfin
 gets hot,

36:17.320 --> 36:21.320
 I never get behind
 the wheel of a car.

36:21.600 --> 36:24.960
 17 years old, driving
 Cheri Abernathy home,

36:24.960 --> 36:27.360
 crashed my
 Aunt Charice's Ford.

36:27.360 --> 36:29.280
 It was my fault.

36:29.280 --> 36:32.640
 Had my face buried
 in her sweater.

36:32.640 --> 36:36.640
 Cheri Abernathy's,
 not Aunt Charice's.

36:42.800 --> 36:44.240
  KNOCK ON DOOR

36:44.240 --> 36:45.200
 Yeah?

36:45.200 --> 36:46.160
 Luther.

36:46.160 --> 36:48.000
 Dr Westphall.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.920
 How's the ambulance
 business?

36:49.920 --> 36:53.920
 Busy. I'll have
 to soak this shirt
 a long time.

36:54.720 --> 36:56.160
 Blood and newsprint.

36:56.160 --> 36:58.040
 Guy riding his bike.

36:58.040 --> 37:00.960
 Got hit by
 a newspaper truck.

37:00.960 --> 37:04.760
 Ruptured spleen
 splashed all over
 the front page.

37:04.760 --> 37:08.760
 Got him stabilized
 and took him to
 Bernheimer Memorial.

37:09.080 --> 37:11.360
 I hope he's OK.

37:11.360 --> 37:13.320
 Call and find out.

37:13.320 --> 37:16.280
 I don't just mean
 his status.

37:16.280 --> 37:20.120
 If we brought him
 here, I'd visit him.

37:20.120 --> 37:24.120
 Being a paramedic,
 I scrape people
 off the pavement

37:24.440 --> 37:26.840
 and never see them
 again.

37:26.840 --> 37:29.240
 That's fine
 for some people,

37:29.240 --> 37:33.160
 But it's just not
 who I am.

37:33.160 --> 37:34.600
 Sometimes we forget

37:34.600 --> 37:37.920
 what we're supposed
 to be doing here

37:37.920 --> 37:40.320
 is taking care
 of people.

37:40.320 --> 37:43.720
 When I started
 this community
 service programme,

37:43.720 --> 37:47.720
 I thought
 it was right,
 and I still do.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.720
 Sometimes it doesn't
 work that way.

37:50.720 --> 37:52.400
 We keep trying.

37:52.400 --> 37:55.320
 Ever heard of
 a physician's assistant?

37:55.320 --> 37:56.280
 Yes.

37:56.280 --> 37:58.760
 I'd like
 helping on rounds,

37:58.760 --> 38:02.120
 checking on patients.
 I'd be good.

38:02.120 --> 38:04.040
 I know this hospital,

38:04.040 --> 38:07.560
 and I could be
 closer to people.

38:07.560 --> 38:10.680
 Luther, you'd be
 a terrific assistant,

38:10.680 --> 38:12.800
 but it's two years

38:12.800 --> 38:15.720
 of postgraduate school
 after college,

38:15.720 --> 38:18.560
 so you're talking
 six years. Understand?

38:18.560 --> 38:20.960
 I'm sure there's
 another way.

38:20.960 --> 38:22.400
 No, there isn't.

38:22.400 --> 38:26.120
 The state can't
 certify you.

38:26.120 --> 38:27.520
 No problem.

38:27.520 --> 38:31.520
 I'll get another
 light bulb for you.

38:39.040 --> 38:40.520
  KNOCK ON DOOR

38:40.520 --> 38:41.720
 Come in.

38:41.720 --> 38:45.720
 Roxanne, can you
 sign Deborah Ettings'
 death certificate?

38:51.760 --> 38:55.760
 I sign this,
 and she's dead.

38:56.920 --> 39:00.120
 There.

39:00.120 --> 39:04.120
 Not a very pleasant
 first day back, huh?

39:04.360 --> 39:08.360
 I was
 the first person
 at Blue Creek Forge

39:08.800 --> 39:10.240
 to attend college.

39:10.240 --> 39:13.120
 Country girl moved
 to the city

39:13.120 --> 39:16.720
 and never wanted
 to go back.

39:16.720 --> 39:18.080
 You went back.

39:18.080 --> 39:20.880
 First day home, I
 felt uncomfortable.

39:20.880 --> 39:24.120
 I thought it would
 change. It didn't.

39:24.120 --> 39:25.880
 I lost a patient,

39:25.880 --> 39:29.880
 blamed it on
 the lack of medical
 sophistication.

39:34.080 --> 39:37.880
 Here I am in Boston
 with no excuses.

39:37.880 --> 39:40.800
 I got
 my old office back.

39:40.800 --> 39:43.680
 I got my
 old apartment back.

39:43.680 --> 39:46.960
 Still nothing
 feels right.

39:46.960 --> 39:50.560
 The truth is
 I don't have a home.

39:50.560 --> 39:54.560
  PHONE BUZZES

39:55.160 --> 39:58.560
 Yes.

39:58.560 --> 40:02.160
 Be right there.

40:02.160 --> 40:04.080
 That was
 social services

40:04.080 --> 40:07.680
 checking up
 on Deborah's baby.

40:07.680 --> 40:11.680
 She doesn't have
 a home, either.

40:16.080 --> 40:18.040
 What do you want?

40:18.040 --> 40:19.480
 Here's
 the information

40:19.480 --> 40:21.400
 on the nosocomial
 infections.

40:21.400 --> 40:23.280
 Good.
 Step in here.

40:23.280 --> 40:26.640
 I entered the data
 into the computer,

40:26.640 --> 40:29.520
 synthesized it,
 and got the results.

40:29.520 --> 40:31.920
 I haven't
 looked at them.

40:31.920 --> 40:33.360
 Good.

40:33.360 --> 40:34.800
 Excellent.

40:34.800 --> 40:36.240
 Job well-done.

40:36.240 --> 40:38.760
 Thanks.
 I busted my butt.

40:38.760 --> 40:40.720
 Get used to it.

40:40.720 --> 40:44.720
 It's going
 to be long hours,
 but worth it

40:45.040 --> 40:48.880
 when your name's
 published Injama
 below mine.

40:48.880 --> 40:50.320
 I don't understand.

40:50.320 --> 40:52.520
 You said
 I was finished.

40:52.520 --> 40:54.960
 You've made
 a decent start,

40:54.960 --> 40:57.800
 but this data
 scratches
 the surface.

40:57.800 --> 41:01.800
 I need a breakdown
 of hospital-acquired
 infections by ward.

41:02.600 --> 41:05.000
 Everything
 there is to know

41:05.000 --> 41:07.400
 about nosocomial
 infections is there.

41:07.400 --> 41:11.240
 Are you weaselling out
 to have more time

41:11.240 --> 41:14.320
 to nip
 at Dr Turner's heels?

41:14.320 --> 41:17.200
 No. She's not
 interested in me.

41:17.200 --> 41:20.360
 She never called me
 after she left.

41:20.360 --> 41:21.800
 It's the gender.

41:21.800 --> 41:24.200
 Women will break
 your heart.

41:24.200 --> 41:26.600
 You get attached
 to them,

41:26.600 --> 41:29.200
 and then
 they leave you.

41:29.200 --> 41:31.600
 She could have
 told me.

41:31.600 --> 41:33.040
 For heaven's sake,

41:33.040 --> 41:35.440
 climb into
 a Skinner box.

41:35.440 --> 41:38.800
 Her behaviour
 speaks for itself.
 It's over.

41:38.800 --> 41:40.240
 Our relationship?

41:40.240 --> 41:44.240
 No, this conversation.

41:45.360 --> 41:46.800
  JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS

41:46.800 --> 41:47.960
  KNOCK ON DOOR

41:47.960 --> 41:51.960
 Come in.

41:52.680 --> 41:54.800
 Nice having you back.

41:54.800 --> 41:55.880
 Tea?

41:55.880 --> 41:59.880
 No, thanks.

42:02.920 --> 42:05.800
 Bet you were scared.
 I would've been.

42:05.800 --> 42:08.200
 Felt like
 a kid again.

42:08.200 --> 42:10.160
 Guns, coppers
 bursting in.

42:10.160 --> 42:14.160
 Brought back memories
 of my days under MacArthur.

42:14.160 --> 42:15.920
 For that short time,

42:15.920 --> 42:19.120
 I didn't feel
 like a dying old man.

42:19.120 --> 42:20.560
 Does Katharine know?

42:20.560 --> 42:24.360
 I reached her
 after Mark
 dropped me off.

42:24.360 --> 42:27.240
 I hear
 the building
 was damaged.

42:27.240 --> 42:31.120
 Reparable.
 And now I feel
 a greater commitment

42:31.120 --> 42:33.000
 to rejuvenating
 that property

42:33.000 --> 42:36.360
 and putting
 something back
 into the neighbourhood.

42:36.360 --> 42:40.360
 Perhaps housing
 for our residents.

42:40.520 --> 42:42.920
 Donald, duck.

42:42.920 --> 42:45.760
 Maybe a shelter
 for the homeless.

42:45.760 --> 42:49.600
 It was run
 by a lad of 17.

42:49.600 --> 42:52.960
 He had intelligent eyes.
 Such a waste.

42:52.960 --> 42:56.800
 Isn't it
 still a felony
 to sell narcotics?

42:56.800 --> 43:00.680
 Because he has neither
 the education nor the skills

43:00.680 --> 43:03.080
 to share
 the American dream,

43:03.080 --> 43:06.120
 his ambition is
 channelled off elsewhere.

43:06.120 --> 43:08.000
 I disagree with you.

43:08.000 --> 43:12.000
 That young man
 seems to be
 doing things right.

44:31.440 --> 44:35.440
 Taxi!

44:38.080 --> 44:42.080
 Roxanne.

44:43.920 --> 44:47.920
 Baby.

44:57.360 --> 45:01.360
 You could've brought
 me flowers, you know.
