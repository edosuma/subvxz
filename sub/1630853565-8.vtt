00:17.434 --> 00:20.937
<i>When I first wrote about</i>
<i>Clark Thompson, the man who glows,</i>

00:21.021 --> 00:25.525
<i>I had in my mind the inspiration of,</i>
<i>"Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus."</i>

00:26.735 --> 00:30.864
<i>I had a thousand excuses as to why Clark</i>
<i>couldn't possibly be a messenger of God</i>

00:30.947 --> 00:32.198
<i>before I met him.</i>

00:32.782 --> 00:36.411
<i>Because even though I personally</i>
<i>do believe in God and Santa Claus,</i>

00:36.494 --> 00:38.913
<i>seeing true evidence</i>
<i>seemed somehow impossible.</i>

00:38.997 --> 00:41.833
<i>But after meeting Clark</i>
<i>and experiencing his peculiar powers,</i>

00:41.916 --> 00:43.793
<i>I can honestly say</i>
<i>that I do believe in God.</i>

00:43.877 --> 00:46.463
<i>And I do believe</i>
<i>that Clark is his latest messenger.</i>

00:48.256 --> 00:51.593
<i>Whether anyone chooses to believe me</i>
<i>in the face of overwhelming evidence,</i>

00:51.676 --> 00:55.722
<i>including the arrival of the Four Horsemen</i>
<i>of the Apocalypse, is their business.</i>

00:56.973 --> 01:00.226
<i>But no matter how many clicks I get,</i>
<i>I know this is the truth.</i>

01:03.229 --> 01:06.149
<i> Now this Clark Thompson</i>
<i>even has his friends</i>

01:06.232 --> 01:09.194
pretending to be
the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

01:09.277 --> 01:11.654
It's horsepeople, you dick!

01:11.738 --> 01:13.990
I mean,
this madness has got to stop!

01:14.074 --> 01:17.285
I've created a bit of a catchphrase
recently. You might have heard it.

01:17.368 --> 01:19.954
-Right, Reverend. That's right!
-Only the righteous are right.

01:20.038 --> 01:21.247
-Yeah!
-And it's true.

01:21.331 --> 01:27.128
Only those who believe in Christ
in the correct way are right.

01:27.212 --> 01:28.713
But, Reverend, by that logic,

01:28.797 --> 01:31.758
what do you say
to all the Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus,

01:31.841 --> 01:33.343
and followers of the Jewish faith?

01:33.426 --> 01:35.637
-Speak the truth!
-Jesus saves!

01:35.720 --> 01:40.350
I would advise every single one of them
to convert to Christianity immediately,

01:40.433 --> 01:43.144
unless they wish to burn in Hell forever

01:43.228 --> 01:46.356
-in everlasting torment and pain.
-Amen!

01:46.439 --> 01:47.398
God bless you all.

01:49.359 --> 01:52.487
-That was harsh.
-Oh! That was great. I have chills.

01:52.570 --> 01:53.947
Oh!

01:54.030 --> 01:55.740
-Thank you, Satalinda.
-Oh!

01:55.824 --> 01:58.535
It takes a strong man to speak such truth,
don't you think?

01:58.618 --> 02:00.745
Very strong. Great presence.

02:00.829 --> 02:01.871
-Well…
-Trust me.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.207
-Oh, well, I do. For everything.

02:04.290 --> 02:06.251
-And great for ratings.
-Yes.

02:08.294 --> 02:11.214
Listen, we're gonna be
doing some more interviews soon.

02:11.297 --> 02:14.717
I just have a few fires I need to put out.
Maybe start a few too.

02:14.801 --> 02:15.635
Ooh!

02:16.761 --> 02:18.930
-You take care, Margie.
-Uh…

02:19.013 --> 02:20.265
No-- It's Maggie.

02:22.433 --> 02:24.936
God, I like her. She's good people.

02:25.979 --> 02:29.065
-You lookin' at my cards?
-No, but you need to…

02:29.149 --> 02:31.651
-I know.
-Okay, I've got another one. Four down.

02:31.734 --> 02:34.487
A three-letter word for "hen."

02:35.363 --> 02:37.407
-Hen.
-It fits.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.160
Knock, knock. Who's there?

02:40.827 --> 02:41.953
It's us. Hi.

02:42.036 --> 02:43.663
-Hey! I didn't know you were coming.
-Hi.

02:43.746 --> 02:45.874
Yeah, I, um… I asked them.

02:45.957 --> 02:50.628
I figured when Satan is FaceTiming
your fella and threatening to kill him,

02:50.712 --> 02:54.716
and torture all of our souls for eternity,
it's time to call in the troops.

02:54.799 --> 02:58.052
I'll tell ya something else. It's not
every day you get to whoop Satan's ass.

02:58.136 --> 02:59.971
-You know? Come on. Who's with me?
-Whoa, whoa.

03:00.054 --> 03:01.556
-Don't hurt yourself, Tom.
-Tom…

03:01.639 --> 03:02.974
Go easy.

03:03.057 --> 03:06.311
Uh… And I don't think
you wanna be fighting Satan, buddy.

03:06.394 --> 03:09.814
Tell you the truth, no. I mean,
that's boss level, hard mode, right?

03:09.898 --> 03:12.483
And I'm really not that good a fighter.
She'll tell you.

03:12.567 --> 03:13.651
You're not great.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.945
I'm also hoping that God is listening

03:16.029 --> 03:19.824
and sees that I'm trying to be really
brave, even though it's quite terrifying.

03:19.908 --> 03:22.327
-Hey, that has to count for something.
-I hope--

03:22.410 --> 03:23.703
-Hey, gang.
-Oh!

03:23.786 --> 03:24.787
-Frisbee!

03:24.871 --> 03:26.748
-Wait, wait. This guy's an angel?

03:27.332 --> 03:30.877
-Indeed I am.
-You must be a… a mid-level angel, right?

03:30.960 --> 03:32.921
-How did you know that?
-The tie.

03:33.004 --> 03:34.589
Mental note about the tie.

03:34.672 --> 03:37.800
Can you even get any air
with those stubby little chicken wings?

03:37.884 --> 03:41.387
Yes, I can. But I need a push
to go in a certain direction.

03:42.847 --> 03:44.974
-Are you okay, Frisbee?
-Yeah, I think so.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.185
What about Chamuel?
Satan said she killed him.

03:47.268 --> 03:49.896
I don't know.
When I returned, Satan was there.

03:49.979 --> 03:52.899
And she was holding
a sword that had blood on it.

03:52.982 --> 03:55.193
-Oh, God. Oh my God.
-Oh, no.

03:55.276 --> 03:58.029
But I didn't see Chamuel.
I didn't see Chamuel's body.

03:58.112 --> 03:59.614
And she is known to fib.

04:00.198 --> 04:02.116
But that is not why I'm here.

04:02.200 --> 04:06.162
Guys, I have to tell you, the spell that
is keeping Satan out of this hospital…

04:06.829 --> 04:08.623
-It expires at dawn.
-Uh…

04:08.706 --> 04:09.666
What? Why?

04:12.043 --> 04:13.044
I'll be straight with you.

04:13.127 --> 04:15.463
-It better not be paperwork!
-It has to do with paperwork.

04:15.546 --> 04:16.714
-Oh my God.
-Oh--

04:16.798 --> 04:18.466
-Come on!
-Come on! God!

04:18.549 --> 04:21.636
-Oh no. Something bad. I gotta go.

04:21.719 --> 04:23.346
-Wait, wait, wait!

04:24.430 --> 04:25.723
-Come on!
-What?

04:25.807 --> 04:28.601
I have to use the restroom.
-Copy that, buddy. I'll come with you.

04:28.685 --> 04:29.686
No, thank you.

04:33.773 --> 04:35.984
Look what I got. Who wants coffee?

04:36.067 --> 04:37.277
-Oh.
-Wow.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.361
Thank you.

04:38.444 --> 04:40.363
-Decaf. Nice.
-Cheers.

04:40.446 --> 04:41.572
Doughnut?

04:43.741 --> 04:44.575
Doughnut?

04:44.659 --> 04:46.369
This is one of your jokes, isn't it?

04:46.452 --> 04:47.578
-I'm Famine.

04:47.662 --> 04:50.957
Just having a little
coffee and doughnuts, are we?

04:51.582 --> 04:55.628
-Not doin' the work at hand?
-Oh, we don't take questions from ladies.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.714
Oh!

04:58.339 --> 04:59.674
-Smack!
-Ah!

05:00.800 --> 05:04.053
Well, now you do, shit-mouth.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.472
-Do you know who you're talking to?
-I'm sorry, Satan.

05:06.556 --> 05:08.349
I didn't recognize you in this form.

05:08.433 --> 05:12.270
You're a filthy sewer mouth.
I don't accept your apology.

05:12.353 --> 05:15.690
Why aren't you ushering in the apocalypse?
I mean, you're here, aren't you?

05:15.773 --> 05:18.192
So let's make with the devastation, huh?

05:18.276 --> 05:20.528
We-- we got orders to come here and begin.

05:20.611 --> 05:23.573
But now we have other orders
to await further instructions.

05:23.656 --> 05:26.951
-And who's giving the orders?
-I… Well, I…

05:27.035 --> 05:28.786
-Answer the question.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.413
Both sides are.

05:33.124 --> 05:35.668
We're here to do the job
as per Lucifer's command.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.253
-He brought us here.
-Uh-huh.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.006
But now the other side
has told us to stand down.

05:40.673 --> 05:42.383
So who are you going to listen to?

05:42.467 --> 05:44.052
Well, we don't know.

05:44.135 --> 05:45.928
The war in Heaven's unsettled.

05:46.012 --> 05:50.099
And it's pretty uncertain who the hell
is exactly in charge right now.

05:50.683 --> 05:52.518
We are largely here for the pageantry.

05:54.103 --> 05:55.813
The pageantry!

05:55.897 --> 05:58.316
Oh, listen to you, Miss America.

05:58.399 --> 05:59.776
The pageantry!

06:00.568 --> 06:02.153
Okay!

06:02.236 --> 06:04.072
Well, well, well.

06:04.155 --> 06:07.116
Your name is War!

06:08.284 --> 06:12.288
So which one of you assholes
is gonna burn the fuck out of the Earth?

06:15.333 --> 06:17.001
-Uh…

06:19.379 --> 06:21.339
Well, could someone help me
get in that building?

06:21.422 --> 06:24.967
Well, it's my understanding that
the structure has been Harry Pottered.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.428
-I guess you're out of luck.
-Shut up.

06:27.929 --> 06:30.515
Fine. I'll just go kill Clark myself.

06:30.598 --> 06:32.433
That's why I don't date demons.

06:33.559 --> 06:35.436
-Hey, what are you doing?

06:37.522 --> 06:39.732
-One stroppy bitch, isn't she?
-Think so.

06:39.816 --> 06:42.276
Okay, I got this. Don't worry about it.

06:42.777 --> 06:45.279
Hi. How you doin'? I'm Death.

06:45.363 --> 06:48.866
Okay, you haven't got long to go.
Okay. You're dead. Good. He's dead.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.496
This could really be the end.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.583
-Hi!
-Oh, sweetie.

07:00.044 --> 07:01.712
-You're alive!
-Oh, yes.

07:01.796 --> 07:04.632
Chamuel is with us too.
Though I have seen him in better shape.

07:05.466 --> 07:06.759
Satan lied, honey.

07:07.343 --> 07:10.596
You do know that she used to be
on our side? Perfect angel.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.014
And then she turned.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.559
Now she's a really bad duck.

07:14.642 --> 07:17.603
So happy to see you. First of all,
without you, there's nothing.

07:17.687 --> 07:18.646
Oh!

07:18.729 --> 07:21.524
And really wish I'd done a better job
getting your message out.

07:21.607 --> 07:25.445
You could have done better, but you also
could have done worse, you know?

07:25.528 --> 07:28.573
-The skywriter misspelled a lot of words.
-I know.

07:28.656 --> 07:30.199
But that's not the real problem.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.618
The problem is that, these days,

07:32.702 --> 07:35.705
a lot of folks don't really even
care if there's a God at all.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.960
Oh. Oh!

07:41.669 --> 07:43.337
Oh… Oh.

07:44.088 --> 07:47.175
-Think that would be easier for you.

07:47.258 --> 07:50.261
Not really great with the physical plane.
Yeah.

07:53.014 --> 07:57.226
Clark, the war in Heaven
isn't going in the right direction.

07:58.227 --> 08:02.231
It ain't over yet, but if I don't set
my full attention to it,

08:02.315 --> 08:03.566
Lucifer could take over.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.194
And I might not have
a chance to have any say

08:06.277 --> 08:08.446
in whether I'm okay with that or not.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.866
So I'm going to be out of pocket
for a while.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.619
-You'll be on your own.
-Oh.

08:14.702 --> 08:16.370
That's not perfect at all.

08:17.121 --> 08:18.748
Well, it is what it is, you know?

08:19.332 --> 08:21.792
So you need to grab your girl, Amily,

08:21.876 --> 08:24.879
and get out of here as fast as you can,
because I might need you later.

08:25.463 --> 08:26.297
Okay.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.382
Was Amily chosen too?

08:28.466 --> 08:29.300
Oh, yes.

08:29.383 --> 08:32.678
I brought her to you and you to her.
She's good people.

08:32.762 --> 08:34.931
Anyway, you need to get out while you can.

08:35.014 --> 08:38.851
And then figure out some sort of a way
to get my message across better. Okay?

08:38.935 --> 08:42.021
Right. If you wanted to tell me how
to do it exactly,

08:42.104 --> 08:43.397
this would be a great time.

08:43.481 --> 08:45.650
You will know when you know.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.653
-Wanna try something fun?
-Sure.

08:48.736 --> 08:52.448
I'm going to tell you
where you need to go next.

08:55.701 --> 08:56.661
That's so cool!

08:56.744 --> 08:58.788
-Fun, right?
-It's in my brain!

08:58.871 --> 09:01.666
Anyway,
I've gotta scoot and, uh…

09:02.333 --> 09:04.043
either save the world or not.

09:04.585 --> 09:05.795
-Cheerio.
-Cheerio.

09:09.799 --> 09:12.718
No coffee this time. Okay.

09:23.062 --> 09:23.896
Hi.

09:24.772 --> 09:26.148
Hey. Where…

09:26.232 --> 09:28.526
You were in the bathroom
for three and a half hours.

09:28.609 --> 09:30.903
I looked in the bathroom several times.
No one was there.

09:30.987 --> 09:34.323
Well, I was in there. I was…
I was talking to God.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.616
-What? Okay.
-Wow.

09:35.700 --> 09:38.744
Every time I don't follow you
into the bathroom, you talk to the boss.

09:38.828 --> 09:42.498
Why doesn't God just quickly kill Satan,
and then we can all go home?

09:42.582 --> 09:45.334
-I don't think it's that easy.
-Oh, gosh. Okay.

09:45.418 --> 09:49.005
I think the Lord helps those who
help themselves, so I've heard, and, uh…

09:49.088 --> 09:51.090
Well, God told me to run away.

09:51.841 --> 09:53.467
-Oh.
-Yeah, I gotta go.

09:54.510 --> 09:57.680
So, uh, do you wanna run away with me?

09:59.557 --> 10:00.558
Yeah. Sure.

10:00.641 --> 10:01.601
Really?

10:01.684 --> 10:03.227
I got nothin' else to do.

10:03.311 --> 10:04.520
Thanks. That's amazing.

10:05.104 --> 10:08.065
Um… And helpful,
because, uh, you've been chosen too.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.401
-God said that about me?
-Mm-hmm.

10:10.484 --> 10:11.694
-What?
-That's awesome.

10:11.777 --> 10:14.113
I always knew you had it in you.
Well done.

10:14.196 --> 10:15.990
Oh, what a beautiful moment.

10:16.073 --> 10:18.159
Where's my-- where's my phone?

10:18.242 --> 10:19.285
-Oh…
-Here.

10:19.368 --> 10:20.536
-Here you go.
-Dad…

10:20.620 --> 10:23.748
You know, I, uh… I might not see you
for a while,

10:23.831 --> 10:25.583
so I'm gonna take this picture.

10:25.666 --> 10:26.792
-Okay.
-Yeah.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.086
-I'm so proud of you.
-Yeah. I'll be in touch, though.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.547
I know. But you gotta--
You gotta do what you gotta do, right?

10:31.631 --> 10:34.634
-It's low. Raise that camera up.
-Okay, pose for me.

10:34.717 --> 10:35.968
-Pose for me.
-Pretty low.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.595
-With beautiful Amily.
-Lift it slightly.

10:37.678 --> 10:38.554
-Stop saying "pose."

10:38.638 --> 10:40.389
-It'd help me feel less posed.
-Just click it.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.391
-I'm only seeing myself.
-Oh, um…

10:42.475 --> 10:43.559
-Yeah.
-Wait, what?

10:43.643 --> 10:45.144
-Just press the middle button.
-Flip it?

10:45.227 --> 10:46.687
-No, that side--
-No…

10:46.771 --> 10:48.689
Back around
and just hit the center one.

10:48.773 --> 10:51.651
I think my smile's turning weird.
I'm holding it too long.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.110
-Quickly.
-And click.

10:53.194 --> 10:55.613
-Yeah, I know how to use a phone.
-Beg your pardon.

10:55.696 --> 10:57.698
-Hold it up.
-I could make a boomerang.

10:57.782 --> 10:58.699
Got it.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.409
Could you text that to me?

11:00.493 --> 11:01.619
That's your phone, sir.

11:01.702 --> 11:03.412
Oh, right.

11:03.913 --> 11:05.539
I'm sorry. Can't we all go?

11:06.248 --> 11:08.125
Sorry. God only mentioned Amily.

11:08.959 --> 11:12.463
I guess that we're pretty much mincemeat
in the eyes of God now, aren't we?

11:12.546 --> 11:13.381
-No.
-We are.

11:13.464 --> 11:16.342
I think-- I think God
just wants you guys all to stay safe.

11:16.425 --> 11:17.635
That's nice.

11:17.718 --> 11:19.804
Well, what do you think?

11:20.388 --> 11:23.140
Ready to get goin'?
I think I know where we're supposed to go.

11:23.641 --> 11:26.852
-God just implanted it in your head?
-Yeah, I even know the route.

11:26.936 --> 11:29.397
-Which is kind of neat.
-That's very cool.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.775
-Where are you going?
-I can't tell you, Mohsin. It's not safe.

11:32.858 --> 11:35.945
-God. You sound so cool saying that.
-And I thank you so very much.

11:36.028 --> 11:39.073
If it's not safe, I'm not letting you
go anywhere. Not without me.

11:39.156 --> 11:42.827
-I need you to do something important.
-Of course. Anything.

11:42.910 --> 11:45.162
Look after my cats.
They mean the world to me.

11:45.246 --> 11:49.458
And just FYI, Skittles loves beer,
and Honey really loves tequila.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.420
Do you give my cats,
like, a lot of alcohol, or…

11:52.503 --> 11:54.130
Oh, what do you consider a lot?

11:54.213 --> 11:56.507
I guess any would be a lot with a cat.

11:56.590 --> 11:59.927
-Please don't give them alcohol.
-Oh, shit. The sun's coming up.

12:00.636 --> 12:02.471
Frisbee said we'd lose
our Harry Potter at dawn.

12:16.318 --> 12:19.029
Who puts a time limit
on Harry Pottering stuff?

12:23.409 --> 12:25.286
-Okay, that can't be good.
-No.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.301
-Let's go this way.
-Okay. Okay.

12:40.384 --> 12:41.802
Oh, God…

12:42.344 --> 12:43.220
-Oh!
-That's a pull.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.472
Yeah, that's a pull!

12:44.972 --> 12:45.973
Let's go.

12:57.401 --> 12:59.278
Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

13:04.074 --> 13:05.493
-Sorry!
-Excuse us.

13:28.474 --> 13:30.476
Come on, go. Come on, come on!

13:32.728 --> 13:36.690
Well, well, well. It seems the charlatan
shall always run away from the light.

13:36.774 --> 13:40.653
You cannot avert the eyes of AOHN
from your evil ways.

13:40.736 --> 13:43.072
Do you guys actually believe
your own bullshit?

13:43.155 --> 13:43.989
Amily.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.451
I'm so sorry
that you lost your parents so young.

13:47.535 --> 13:50.371
And I'm really sorry
that your aunt was so horrible to you,

13:50.454 --> 13:52.248
saying that you'd never be worth anything.

13:52.915 --> 13:54.792
That's why you always
pick lint off your shirt,

13:54.875 --> 13:56.669
because she always said you were dirty.

13:56.752 --> 13:58.170
I'm really sorry.

13:58.921 --> 14:00.881
How did you know that?
I've never told anyone that.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.509
<i>Deos te absolves.</i>

14:05.219 --> 14:06.554
God forgives me?

14:06.637 --> 14:08.430
<i>Liquore alais linguia?</i>

14:09.431 --> 14:11.183
Yes. You are speaking
a different language.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.810
Am I translating Latin for you?

14:12.893 --> 14:15.020
-How did you do that?
-I don't know.

14:17.481 --> 14:20.484
I've memorized the exit plans.
There's seven exits in total.

14:20.568 --> 14:21.694
Which one do we take?

14:21.777 --> 14:25.281
The front door. It's the most obvious.
She would never think we would choose it.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.908
I mean, I-- I think. Or-- I'm not sure.

14:27.992 --> 14:30.411
If it's okay,
I'm gonna kiss you right now.

14:30.494 --> 14:33.247
-Ooh! Uh… Well, um, that's perfectly…
-Okay.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.378
Uh… Kids.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.465
Hey. Uh, hey. We gotta go.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.385
-Right. Imminent death. Okay, let's go.
-Yeah.

14:46.468 --> 14:47.803
Excuse me! Uh…

14:47.887 --> 14:49.388
-Thank you so much for that.
-It's okay.

14:50.931 --> 14:52.558
Oh, no. God.

14:52.641 --> 14:53.517
Hey, buddy.

14:54.351 --> 14:55.686
It's great to see ya again.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.314
You ready to come join our team?

14:59.106 --> 15:01.025
No. No.

15:01.108 --> 15:05.446
I am here to watch over Clark.
And that's what I'm going to do.

15:05.529 --> 15:07.489
Even though they don't respect you?

15:08.991 --> 15:13.829
Our side can give you stuff.
All kinds of stuff.

15:14.663 --> 15:15.706
Like a room

15:16.457 --> 15:17.583
full of files

15:18.167 --> 15:21.545
that never ever ends.

15:22.963 --> 15:23.923
Well…

15:24.882 --> 15:26.675
-That sounds really good, honestly.
-Mm-hmm.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.510
But you're also the Lord of Lies.

15:30.721 --> 15:32.890
So I'm gonna stay on track, and…

15:33.474 --> 15:35.851
I don't wanna hurt you,
but I have been known--

15:38.062 --> 15:40.648
I was saying-- Oof! Oh!

15:41.273 --> 15:43.025
-Wow.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.777
-That stung.
-Frisbee!

15:45.903 --> 15:48.656
How are you taking this much punishment?
It's very impressive.

15:48.739 --> 15:51.825
It's a funny story. If we could
stop fighting, we could talk about it.

15:52.409 --> 15:54.161
-I don't have that time.

15:54.244 --> 15:56.121
But can I ask you something?

15:56.205 --> 15:58.707
-Oh--
-Can we always stay friends?

15:59.291 --> 16:01.126
You're so pretty.

16:01.210 --> 16:02.211
I know.

16:07.383 --> 16:09.969
-Well, that Frisbee didn't fly.

16:13.263 --> 16:15.891
Oh my God. Throp, listen to me.

16:16.600 --> 16:19.728
That man that has smashed
on top of that ambulance is an angel.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.397
He's an actual angel of God.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.358
We can't stay here. It's not safe
for Clark. So will you help him?

16:25.818 --> 16:27.152
Will you help him?

16:30.072 --> 16:31.657
Somebody help me with that man!

16:32.658 --> 16:34.827
-Move! Move!

16:35.995 --> 16:37.287
I think this is all gonna work.

16:37.371 --> 16:38.914
-Whoo!

16:40.916 --> 16:42.584
Worked for me.

16:43.377 --> 16:45.170
I'm going to kill all of you

16:45.254 --> 16:47.756
and then suck the marrow
out of your souls.

16:49.216 --> 16:50.467
I feel bad for you.

16:50.551 --> 16:53.345
Oh, you do feel so bad for me?

16:53.429 --> 16:55.264
I've seen inside your heart.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.600
You want those other demons
to respect you.

16:59.226 --> 17:01.145
You want for them to look up to you.

17:02.312 --> 17:05.024
You shouldn't be here
finishing off weak mortals.

17:06.191 --> 17:10.320
You belong in the great battle in Heaven,
garnering the ultimate glory.

17:11.238 --> 17:12.948
You deserve to be the one in charge.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.200
That's right.

17:17.536 --> 17:18.787
That's what I see too.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.707
And that's what I deserve.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.126
And that's what I'm going to get.

17:27.671 --> 17:29.882
Come on, Horsemen! Yaaah!

17:30.674 --> 17:33.093
I don't know if we'll make it.
I never wanted to get trampled.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.345
Not exactly on anyone's wish list.
Just go, go, go, go!

17:39.099 --> 17:41.101
Did you just mind-control Satan?

17:41.185 --> 17:43.896
It was like I could see inside her
evil heart

17:43.979 --> 17:45.606
and see the vanity that was in there,

17:45.689 --> 17:48.233
and told her she should pursue
what she really wants to do.

17:48.317 --> 17:49.985
-She did, and it was amazing!
-Thanks.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.404
Hey, stop!
Weren't we supposed to meet Tom here?

17:59.661 --> 18:01.580
You shall not pass!

18:06.168 --> 18:08.170
Guys, they're confused
by my half-nakedness.

18:08.253 --> 18:10.672
-Get the hell outta here! Go, go!
-Thanks, Tom!

18:11.256 --> 18:12.841
Here. Can you drive?

18:12.925 --> 18:13.967
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:14.051 --> 18:15.135
Oh my God!

18:15.219 --> 18:16.762
Where's his pants?

18:16.845 --> 18:18.555
Okay, demons.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.643
That sword's obviously fake.

18:25.229 --> 18:26.438
-Ha!
-I said don't pass.

18:26.522 --> 18:27.731
-I said don't…

18:27.815 --> 18:29.483
Okay. Okay.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.795
Why did I take my clothes off?

18:54.633 --> 18:55.717
I hope Frisbee's okay.

18:56.468 --> 18:58.804
Yeah, I… I bet he is.
I mean, he's an angel.

18:58.887 --> 19:01.473
That… That has to count
for something, right?

19:02.057 --> 19:03.183
Yeah. Yeah.

19:03.684 --> 19:05.060
-I hope you're right.
-Yeah.

19:06.186 --> 19:08.647
-I wanna know, where is Satan?

19:09.523 --> 19:13.235
I don't know.
I can't even get a vibe. Usually, I…

19:13.318 --> 19:15.737
I was hoping maybe
I'd have some kind of feeling about it.

19:15.821 --> 19:16.738
-And I don't.
-Nothing?

19:16.822 --> 19:21.451
Nothing. But I don't think God would
leave us to deal with her on our own.

19:21.535 --> 19:22.744
I hope not.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.998
I just want everybody to be all right.

19:26.081 --> 19:27.791
I even want God to be all right.

19:28.667 --> 19:29.710
Yeah.

19:30.294 --> 19:31.628
-And Chamuel.

19:33.881 --> 19:36.800
Weird times,
when you've gotta pray for the angels.

19:37.718 --> 19:38.552
Yeah.

19:39.303 --> 19:43.891
All I'm seeing on a continuous loop
is Tom in his tiny underpants, so…

19:47.186 --> 19:48.562
He really showed up, huh?

19:49.771 --> 19:51.356
-They all did.
-Yeah.

19:52.524 --> 19:54.276
Thank you for coming with me.

19:54.860 --> 19:55.903
Of course.

20:00.574 --> 20:04.369
The Mamas and the Papas.

20:04.453 --> 20:06.788
I-- I love the Mamas and the Papas.

20:06.872 --> 20:09.458
-They're my favorite after Rush.

20:09.541 --> 20:11.418
-I know.

20:11.501 --> 20:13.587
-How? Did I ever tell you that?

20:13.670 --> 20:16.215
-No.

20:29.728 --> 20:33.023
-I love you.

20:33.106 --> 20:37.444
<i>
I love you too.</i>

20:37.527 --> 20:38.946
Even though you already knew that.

20:39.029 --> 20:41.698
-I knew it.

20:41.782 --> 20:42.616
You know what?

20:43.408 --> 20:47.246
-Maybe everything will be just fine.

20:47.329 --> 20:48.372
Maybe.
