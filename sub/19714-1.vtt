you know that, right?

cleansing after everyone leaves.

Cool, can I leave, too?
No.

She's just gonna burn some sage,
and you are going to be nice.

19:40.090 --> 19:41.920

this house is creepy?

19:49.730 --> 19:51.040
Mmm.
Yup.

19:51.130 --> 19:53.080
I don't, but I'm not a girl.

19:53.170 --> 19:56.160
And I think you should get dressed,
'cause we're playing baseball.

21:20.970 --> 21:26.520

there were sounds and what?

21:26.610 --> 21:28.560
"Bad vibrations"?
Yeah.

21:28.930 --> 21:31.000
And now if they're gone,
then what's the big deal?

21:31.090 --> 21:33.160

bad shit away, right?

21:34.090 --> 21:35.360
That's tight.

You're actually psychic?

21:37.130 --> 21:38.560
Sensitive, my mother says.

21:38.650 --> 21:39.650
Oh, "Sensitive," huh?

21:39.770 --> 21:42.480
So, what, your mom locked you under
the stairs when you were a kid?

21:42.570 --> 21:43.710
You shoot knives at her.

21:44.650 --> 21:46.520
Yeah. No.

21:49.570 --> 21:50.840
But I could find stuff.

21:50.930 --> 21:53.130
I always knew when people were
coming over to the house.

21:54.330 --> 21:57.080
You know what I'm thinking?

21:59.210 --> 22:01.800
Yes. I might just do that.

22:02.770 --> 22:06.000
Damn, you are psychic.

22:06.970 --> 22:08.320
Sensitive there, for sure.

22:10.450 --> 22:12.360
Elliot...
It's okay, Sasha.

22:12.450 --> 22:14.600
People have
doubted me my whole life.

22:14.690 --> 22:16.000
Elliot, you can go ahead

22:16.090 --> 22:19.120
and live a sheltered, shallow,
physical existence.

22:20.330 --> 22:22.840
Well, a non-physical existence
would be kind of tough.

trying to say is...

22:31.770 --> 22:33.560
Okay, let's just
take some deep breaths.

22:33.650 --> 22:34.650
Okay.

22:39.530 --> 22:42.440
So, if nothing happens,
I should believe, 'cause it means

22:42.530 --> 22:43.750
you got rid of the spirit.

22:43.890 --> 22:45.240
Elliot, come on.
What?

22:45.330 --> 22:47.290
We all know you don't believe
in this stuff, okay?

22:47.330 --> 22:49.320
But can you just
please let her do it?

22:49.410 --> 22:51.520
Right. Sorry.
No being rational.

22:51.610 --> 22:52.750
I give over. I do.

the grip a little bit,

but I do know this stuff.

23:38.930 --> 23:43.360
Bro, I didn't say anything.
Swear.

23:45.530 --> 23:46.730
I would never tell anyone that.

23:48.450 --> 23:49.880
They're worried
about you, though.

23:49.970 --> 23:53.280
All right, I'm sorry I laughed at
you before, but that's not funny.

23:53.530 --> 23:56.040
I'm not being funny, Elliot.
This is just what I'm getting.

23:56.930 --> 23:58.360

Your brother will do anything in
his power to protect you now.

he's taking on too much.

to my brother tonight.

I'll take you up
on that, though.

the blindfolding,

01:09:16.090 --> 01:09:17.290
Okay, maybe I'll see you later,

01:09:17.330 --> 01:09:18.500
maybe I'll have a fix for this.

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:20.960
I gotta go. Thanks.
Oh, you're welcome...

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:23.080
I'll be there soon.

01:09:33.890 --> 01:09:35.520
He almost got us, man.

01:09:35.609 --> 01:09:39.120
Oh, fuck! I almost killed you with a bat,
but, fuck, he's not going to get us.

He's not going to get us.

01:09:40.810 --> 01:09:41.950
I'll figure this out.

01:09:42.050 --> 01:09:43.399
I'm really sorry, but...

01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:46.200
I'm sorry, I can't call an ambulance,
'cause you're gonna say it.

01:09:46.290 --> 01:09:48.040
You will. You will.
'Cause I messed you up.

I'm going to go talk to her.

I said, leave! Are you deaf,
or just defective?

01:11:48.490 --> 01:11:51.920
Ms. Redmon, did your husband write
for The Register a long time ago?

01:11:52.330 --> 01:11:54.790
You're too young
to remember that.

01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:57.320
Ms. Redmon.
You're still alive.

01:11:58.210 --> 01:12:00.880
I know your husband
killed a lot of people.

01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:02.210
But I don't think he was crazy.

01:12:08.410 --> 01:12:11.240
I need your help,
whatever you remember.

01:12:21.210 --> 01:12:23.510
What Larry told me
gave me nightmares.

01:12:23.610 --> 01:12:25.000
I made him stop.

01:12:25.890 --> 01:12:26.890
I understand.

01:12:27.330 --> 01:12:30.800
But I need you to tell me
everything Larry said.

01:12:31.450 --> 01:12:32.640
Please.

01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:36.160
Larry was on a story of a
teenager who killed his family.

01:12:37.890 --> 01:12:42.880
Poked around like a good nosy
reporter and heard rumors...

01:12:43.010 --> 01:12:45.520
Whispers about an evil,

01:12:45.610 --> 01:12:49.200
some kind of a reaper
that drove the teenager mad.

01:12:50.290 --> 01:12:52.850
Larry had to go nosing around
and writing it down.

01:12:53.370 --> 01:12:55.930
And then it came to Larry, too,

01:12:56.010 --> 01:13:00.760
this nightmare, this name
we must not think or say.

01:13:02.290 --> 01:13:06.200
But just three days after
Larry got back from Iowa,

01:13:06.290 --> 01:13:08.120
I came home from work.

Once you know his name,
you can't escape him.

01:14:03.650 --> 01:14:07.520
You see,
he gets in your head and...

01:14:08.290 --> 01:14:10.590
He makes you do horrible things.

Listen. Listen, I didn't know
if he was alive or dead.

01:14:24.210 --> 01:14:25.560
And then the hound...

01:14:25.650 --> 01:14:27.040
That's how you know he's coming.

01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:29.400
When you see the hound
and you hear the coins,

01:14:29.490 --> 01:14:31.240

know he's close by.

I don't know what's happened,
but I'm trying...

He listens for his name.

01:14:39.730 --> 01:14:41.880

It could be you.

Or it could be me.

like the flip of a coin.

and I told Janey the name.

Don't say it."

What did you write?

I don't understand.

If my husband had
told me the name,

01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:02.740
he'd have had to
kill me with the rest.

01:16:02.770 --> 01:16:04.400
My husband controlled himself.

01:16:04.490 --> 01:16:08.440
Your fucking husband wrote the name in
the nightstand you sold and I read it.

01:16:08.530 --> 01:16:11.240
He typed it in a dead article
and I read that, too!

first and then kill yourself.

01:16:36.690 --> 01:16:39.120
No!
There has to be another way.

01:16:39.210 --> 01:16:41.840

hear things, tricks to make us afraid.

He makes us afraid.
Then he grows.

01:17:01.410 --> 01:17:03.640
The more scared we are,
the more real he gets.

01:17:03.770 --> 01:17:05.320
We make him real with our fear.

01:17:05.410 --> 01:17:07.440
We make him more powerful.

01:17:09.410 --> 01:17:11.160
Yeah, we give him the power

01:17:11.250 --> 01:17:13.450
and he gets closer and he hears
us when we think of him.

01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:15.920
But maybe, if we're not afraid,
we take his power.

01:17:16.010 --> 01:17:18.280

he's nothing!
