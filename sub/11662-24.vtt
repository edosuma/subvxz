(tranquil music playing)

01:04.233 --> 01:05.300
Hi, girls.

01:05.367 --> 01:07.567
Oh, Rose, I missed
you at breakfast.

01:07.633 --> 01:09.433
Did you and Miles have fun?

01:09.500 --> 01:12.900
We had dinner at the
Mandarin Rathskeller,

01:12.967 --> 01:14.533
that new Chinese/German
restaurant.

01:14.600 --> 01:17.033
-How was it?
-The food was good,

01:17.100 --> 01:19.834
but an hour later
we were both hungry...

01:19.900 --> 01:21.100
for power.

01:23.333 --> 01:24.600
(doorbell rings)

01:25.467 --> 01:28.967
Oh, my, that provincial
midwestern sense of humor

01:29.033 --> 01:30.900
that everybody hates.

01:32.367 --> 01:33.300
Yes?

01:33.367 --> 01:36.200
I'm Detective Parres,
Dade County P.D.

01:36.266 --> 01:38.433
Does a Sophia Petrillo reside here?

01:38.500 --> 01:41.200
This is my mother. Is there a problem?

01:41.266 --> 01:42.934
I have a few questions.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.567
I've got nothing to hide, copper.

01:44.633 --> 01:47.033
Or do you prefer flatfoot?

01:47.100 --> 01:49.633
Before my mother
lost it completely,

01:49.700 --> 01:52.500
she watched a lot
of James Cagney.

01:53.767 --> 01:56.900
They colorized him.
Let the man rest.

01:56.967 --> 02:00.500
He's got hair the color of roses
and more rouge than Blanche.

02:01.333 --> 02:04.400
Whatever you think she did,
she's guilty. I saw her.

02:05.266 --> 02:06.600
Please sit down.

02:07.867 --> 02:12.333
Mrs. Petrillo, where were you
on the night of September 4, 1985?

02:12.400 --> 02:15.767
Did you see <i>Awakenings?</i>
Throw a ball at me.

02:15.834 --> 02:16.900
How should I know?

02:16.967 --> 02:19.867
I don't even remember what
color underwear I'm wearing.

02:19.934 --> 02:22.967
Ma, the beginning of September.

02:23.033 --> 02:25.700
That's when Shady Pines burned down

02:25.767 --> 02:27.834
and you came here to live with us.

02:27.900 --> 02:29.400
Oh, yeah.

02:29.467 --> 02:31.934
I'm not wearing underpants.

02:32.533 --> 02:36.100
Mrs. Petrillo, were you acquainted
with the late Maria Heartgrove?

02:36.166 --> 02:37.867
She died? Good riddance.

02:37.934 --> 02:40.033
God rest her soul.

02:40.100 --> 02:44.100
We have her deathbed confession
stating you two started the fire.

02:44.166 --> 02:46.066
That's ridiculous.

02:46.133 --> 02:47.667
What did you do?

02:47.734 --> 02:50.033
She claimed that on the night of the fire,

02:50.100 --> 02:52.967
the two of you were in your room
cooking s'mores.

02:53.033 --> 02:55.233
I don't know what s'mores are.

02:55.300 --> 02:58.533
You remember... those little toasted
graham cracker

02:58.600 --> 02:59.767
and chocolate sandwiches.

02:59.834 --> 03:02.033
With marshmallow.
Don't forget the marshmallow.

03:02.100 --> 03:03.166
Whoops.

03:04.767 --> 03:07.734
Mrs. Heartgrove said that
you were in possession

03:07.800 --> 03:09.633
of an illegal hot plate.

03:09.700 --> 03:12.400
While you were cooking,
the curtains caught fire.

03:12.467 --> 03:14.066
Then you panicked and fled.

03:14.133 --> 03:15.533
The fire continued unchecked.

03:15.600 --> 03:18.934
Now, wait just a minute. This is crazy.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.433
Do you have proof?

03:20.500 --> 03:22.700
Did anybody find that alleged hot plate?

03:22.767 --> 03:24.533
It was lost in the fire.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.200
Maria was out to get me.

03:26.266 --> 03:29.867
She was jealous because
I still had my own hair.

03:30.934 --> 03:32.934
I'm sorry, Mrs. Petrillo.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.967
I have to bring you in
on a charge of negligent arson.

03:37.033 --> 03:39.734
My mother is 85 years old.
Surely you--

03:39.800 --> 03:42.867
I'm sorry. The law
recognizes no age limits.

03:42.934 --> 03:46.033
Mrs. Petrillo, you're under arrest.

03:54.667 --> 03:56.633
Well, all's well
that end's well.

03:56.700 --> 03:57.633
Huh?

03:57.700 --> 03:59.367
It's a title of a Shakespeare play.

03:59.433 --> 04:02.800
Well, Rose, nothing is well
and nothing is ended.

04:02.867 --> 04:05.233
Sophia's out on bail
awaiting her trial.

04:05.300 --> 04:08.433
Well, if Dorothy had said it,
you'd think it was brilliant.

04:10.233 --> 04:12.333
So this is life on the outside.

04:12.400 --> 04:13.700
It's changed.

04:14.667 --> 04:16.800
You've all gotten so old.

04:17.867 --> 04:20.600
You were gone an hour.

04:20.667 --> 04:22.266
If anyone's upset, it's me.

04:22.333 --> 04:24.066
I had to dig up bail money.

04:24.133 --> 04:27.633
You put a price on
getting your mother back?

04:27.700 --> 04:29.633
What was it, $500?

04:29.700 --> 04:31.333
5,000.

04:31.400 --> 04:34.100
Wow. I better improve
my attitude around here.

04:34.166 --> 04:35.600
(doorbell rings)

04:38.533 --> 04:41.767
Well, Herb, here you are. Hi.

04:41.834 --> 04:45.400
Girls, this is Herb Shrewsbury,
our lawyer.

04:45.467 --> 04:49.900
What are my chances, Shyster?
Or do you prefer ambulance chaser?

04:49.967 --> 04:52.900
He's here to help you.
Are you nuts?

04:52.967 --> 04:54.633
If it helps.

04:55.333 --> 04:58.834
The trial is set for a month from now.

04:58.900 --> 05:00.900
I'll need some character witnesses.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.533
Start by interviewing me.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.633
I'd make a wonderful witness.

05:04.700 --> 05:09.266
I can't tell you how many times
I've been badgered by lawyers.

05:09.333 --> 05:12.500
Well, I could, but it might
sound like boasting.

05:12.567 --> 05:16.100
Oh, the stories
I could tell you about me.

05:16.166 --> 05:18.467
You won't believe this, but...

05:18.533 --> 05:20.967
I'll become a great southern writer,

05:21.000 --> 05:22.533
carrying on the tradition

05:22.600 --> 05:24.533
of the other great
southern writers,

05:24.600 --> 05:27.066
like, uh...

05:29.900 --> 05:33.667
all those that are so famous they
need not be mentioned.

05:33.734 --> 05:37.934
It'll be so exciting.
I'm going to make a fortune,

05:38.033 --> 05:40.166
and I won't have to
use my imagination.

05:40.233 --> 05:42.200
My life is a romance novel.

05:42.266 --> 05:44.500
Your life
is a sports page.

05:46.867 --> 05:48.633
Listen. Tell me I can't
do better than this

05:48.700 --> 05:50.367
in my sleep.

05:50.433 --> 05:53.200
"He grabbed her.
She could feel his fingers

05:53.266 --> 05:55.433
pressing into her moist flesh.

05:55.500 --> 05:59.300
Her heart was pounding,
her loins on fire.

05:59.367 --> 06:00.800
As he spun her around,

06:00.867 --> 06:02.133
her dress ripping open--"

06:02.200 --> 06:05.467
You know how many times
I've experienced that?

06:09.400 --> 06:11.633
Your loins have been on fire?

06:17.800 --> 06:19.467
Yes.

06:20.567 --> 06:21.533
"She melted--"

06:21.600 --> 06:24.567
Where exactly are your loins?

06:26.266 --> 06:27.767
It doesn't matter.
Just listen.

06:27.834 --> 06:29.867
"She melted into his arms,

06:29.934 --> 06:32.367
faint now with the animal musk of him."

06:32.433 --> 06:35.200
I didn't know people had loins.

06:36.600 --> 06:39.533
I've heard of loin of pork, but...

06:39.600 --> 06:42.367
In her case, the same thing.

06:45.433 --> 06:47.066
Isn't this exciting,

06:47.133 --> 06:49.000
taking part in a protest?

06:49.066 --> 06:51.100
Standing up as free Americans.

06:51.166 --> 06:56.000
Exercising our right to say we're mad
and we won't take it anymore.

06:56.066 --> 06:59.133
I'm out of spit. Can I go now?

07:00.266 --> 07:02.700
20 envelopes and you're ready to quit?

07:02.767 --> 07:05.633
We joined the friends
of sea mammals for a reason.

07:05.700 --> 07:08.033
You are so unmotivated.

07:08.100 --> 07:12.500
Well, when I joined this mammals
with blowholes thing...

07:14.467 --> 07:16.500
I didn't expect to be
carrying picket signs

07:16.567 --> 07:18.900
on some grungy dock.

07:18.967 --> 07:22.533
I was hoping more
for a fund raiser/cocktail party

07:22.600 --> 07:25.266
with Chinese lanterns
and Portuguese--

07:25.333 --> 07:29.100
no, Hispanic waiters
in tight black pants...

07:30.266 --> 07:33.500
and we hire a band
to play fish songs

07:33.567 --> 07:37.367
in pirate suits
with muscles bulging.

07:47.400 --> 07:50.900
Your mouth is watering now,
Blanche. Keep licking.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.500
Herb, I'm aware of how important it is

07:57.567 --> 07:59.567
to make a good impression in court.

07:59.633 --> 08:02.700
What would move the jury more,

08:02.767 --> 08:05.066
cleavage or a lot of leg?

08:05.133 --> 08:08.100
That depends on what
you're going for--

08:08.166 --> 08:11.100
a chuckle or a guffaw.

08:13.233 --> 08:15.533
Blanche, I think
a conservative ensemble

08:15.600 --> 08:17.967
is in Sophia's best interest.

08:18.033 --> 08:20.233
Oh, there will be music?

08:21.300 --> 08:23.400
Ma, where are you going?

08:23.467 --> 08:25.233
If he puts you three
on the stand?

08:25.300 --> 08:26.567
Up the river.

08:34.100 --> 08:36.433
Ma, what are you doing up?

08:36.500 --> 08:39.233
I keep thinking back to that night.

08:39.300 --> 08:40.033
And?

08:40.100 --> 08:42.734
And we're out of toilet paper.

08:42.800 --> 08:45.467
I told you. I can't remember a thing.

08:46.033 --> 08:49.200
Just because your memory's fuzzy
doesn't mean you're guilty.

08:49.266 --> 08:51.200
Doesn't mean
I'm innocent, either.

08:51.266 --> 08:54.433
Let's face it, Dorothy.
I've done some pretty peculiar things.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.967
My excuse is I'm an old lady.

08:57.033 --> 08:59.400
I left my mind in the '60as.

09:00.033 --> 09:01.600
Dorothy, have you seen my teeth?

09:04.700 --> 09:06.533
They're in your mouth, Ma.

09:06.600 --> 09:07.867
I know that.

09:07.934 --> 09:09.033
Don't they look good?

09:09.100 --> 09:10.633
I ran them through the dishwasher.

09:14.367 --> 09:16.667
Ma, listen to me.

09:17.300 --> 09:20.400
You got Martha Raye
and Madge mixed up again.

09:22.300 --> 09:24.667
Morning, Blanche, Ma.
You sleep well?

09:24.734 --> 09:26.767
No, I had that
recurring nightmare.

09:26.834 --> 09:29.233
I'm in bed with Warren Beatty.

09:29.300 --> 09:32.400
He says, "sorry, this is too sick
even for me."

09:33.867 --> 09:37.166
Well, now I know why
Hemingway killed himself.

09:37.233 --> 09:40.300
Oh, girls, I have writer's block.

09:40.367 --> 09:42.767
It is the worst feeling in the world.

09:42.834 --> 09:46.266
Try 10 days without
a bowel movement sometime.

09:56.200 --> 10:01.066
You just sit there
hour after hour after hour.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.600
Tell me about it.

10:07.633 --> 10:09.033
Frisk me.

10:09.100 --> 10:11.000
Ma, what are you doing?

10:11.066 --> 10:13.433
Just frisk me.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.533
It's important practice
if I'm going to prison.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.533
You're not going to prison.

10:18.533 --> 10:19.734
(Dorothy) Now think back.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.633
Shady Pines.

10:22.233 --> 10:25.000
What was the last thing
that you remember

10:25.066 --> 10:26.500
before that fire?

10:26.567 --> 10:28.400
Meat loaf.

10:28.467 --> 10:30.100
Nine days in a row.

10:32.066 --> 10:33.367
Their only witness is dead.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.133
That works in our favor.

10:36.734 --> 10:40.100
Dorothy, that hot plate was mine.

10:40.166 --> 10:42.100
I made s'mores all the time.

10:42.166 --> 10:44.066
I hated Shady Pines.

10:44.133 --> 10:47.633
I can't remember,
but I know I did it.

10:48.433 --> 10:49.567
I must have.

10:51.166 --> 10:52.700
I'm going to prison.

11:03.500 --> 11:04.900
Ma won't come out of her room.

11:04.967 --> 11:06.667
She's miserable.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.800
Just to keep me up to speed,

11:08.867 --> 11:10.934
it's this negligent arson rap

11:11.033 --> 11:15.734
and the prospect of her spending
her waning years in jail thing?

11:16.333 --> 11:19.200
No, it's the Rose
in the kitchen thing.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.633
I hate seeing Sophia so unhappy.

11:22.700 --> 11:25.467
I wish there was something we could do
to make her feel better.

11:25.533 --> 11:28.734
We're always there
when we need each other.

11:28.800 --> 11:33.400
If I have a problem, Rose is there.
I'm there for Dorothy.

11:33.467 --> 11:35.700
I wish I knew what to do.

11:35.767 --> 11:38.767
All right, I can pick up a cue.

11:38.834 --> 11:41.066
Picture it--

11:41.133 --> 11:43.000
Sicily, 1912.

11:44.200 --> 11:48.166
A beautiful young peasant girl
with clear olive skin

11:48.233 --> 11:51.500
meets an exciting
but penniless Spanish artist.

11:51.567 --> 11:53.700
There's an instant attraction.

11:53.767 --> 11:56.066
They laugh, they sing,

11:56.133 --> 11:58.500
they slam down
a few boilermakers.

11:59.700 --> 12:03.834
Shortly afterwards, he's arrested for
showing her how he can hold his palette

12:03.900 --> 12:05.767
without using his hands.

12:11.133 --> 12:13.000
But I digress.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.567
He paints her portrait,

12:14.633 --> 12:17.066
and they make passionate love.

12:17.133 --> 12:20.500
She spends much of the next day
with a loofah sponge

12:20.567 --> 12:23.266
scrubbing his fingerprints
off her body.

12:24.734 --> 12:27.633
She sees the portrait and is insulted.

12:27.700 --> 12:29.333
It looks nothing like her,

12:29.400 --> 12:32.066
and she storms
out of his life forever.

12:33.266 --> 12:36.533
That peasant girl was me,

12:36.600 --> 12:39.767
and that painter
was Pablo Picasso.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.767
I have a feeling you're lying.

12:48.834 --> 12:52.700
-Be positive, Dorothy.
-Okay, I'm positive you're lying.

12:52.767 --> 12:54.433
This is terrible.

12:54.500 --> 12:58.567
Trick move from your
checkers-by-mail partner?

12:58.633 --> 13:01.266
No. It's from the company
Charlie worked for.

13:01.333 --> 13:04.367
They've gone bankrupt.
So has their pension fund.

13:04.433 --> 13:06.867
I won't get pension checks anymore.

13:06.934 --> 13:09.133
I can't live without that pension.

13:09.200 --> 13:12.600
Let's not panic.
They can't just cut you off.

13:12.667 --> 13:15.266
She's right.
There has to be an explanation.

13:15.333 --> 13:17.867
Call them tomorrow.
Everything will be fine.

13:17.934 --> 13:20.834
What if I can't pay my own way?

13:20.900 --> 13:23.200
What if I can't afford food

13:23.266 --> 13:26.333
or have to sleep outside
in some park?

13:26.400 --> 13:29.367
There's an old Italian saying
for times like this--

13:29.433 --> 13:31.467
<i>Scapa. Tu si mal fortuna.</i>

13:31.533 --> 13:32.734
What does that mean?

13:32.800 --> 13:34.967
Get away from me.
You're bad luck.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.400
Okay, that's it. Drink this.

13:40.467 --> 13:42.367
It's a secret potion from the old country,

13:42.433 --> 13:44.333
guaranteed to put you to sleep.

13:45.033 --> 13:45.934
Looks like milk.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.400
Trust me, Rose. Drink it.

13:48.467 --> 13:49.900
Slowly.

13:49.967 --> 13:52.166
That's right. Down the hatch.

13:53.967 --> 13:56.934
We call this Sicilian Sominex.

13:58.967 --> 14:00.867
Now, you might feel a slight tingling.

14:00.934 --> 14:04.166
But believe me,
you'll sleep like a baby.

14:07.333 --> 14:10.600
I don't feel any tingling,
when's it gonna hit me?

14:10.667 --> 14:12.400
Sophia!

14:13.900 --> 14:15.800
I just had a terrible thought.

14:15.867 --> 14:20.667
What if all this was true,
and ma went to jail?

14:20.734 --> 14:22.400
Oh, my God.

14:28.233 --> 14:32.133
This is very important.
It might take a couple hours,

14:32.200 --> 14:35.133
so relax and get comfortable.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.667
The last time someone said that
to me

14:37.734 --> 14:39.333
I had two pigs on my back

14:39.400 --> 14:42.266
and I was pushing a wheelbarrow.

14:42.333 --> 14:43.333
Why?

14:43.400 --> 14:45.467
To relax and get comfortable.

14:46.200 --> 14:48.800
Okay, now where should I begin?

14:48.867 --> 14:51.100
I think the one thing you need to know is

14:51.166 --> 14:55.100
I'm the one around here
with the level head.

14:55.166 --> 14:58.533
I haven't been
this scared since 1952

14:58.600 --> 15:00.834
when St. Olaf's most active volcano

15:00.900 --> 15:02.467
threatened to erupt.

15:04.667 --> 15:07.133
Luckily, there were
some druid priests

15:07.200 --> 15:10.100
who were in town for the
opening of Stonehengeland.

15:10.166 --> 15:12.900
They said they could stop it

15:12.967 --> 15:16.100
if they could sacrifice
the town's dumbest virgin.

15:19.166 --> 15:22.066
I don't know why I raised my hand.

15:26.600 --> 15:29.667
It must have been
the excitement of the moment.

15:29.734 --> 15:32.100
They said the only way
to prevent the eruption

15:32.166 --> 15:35.100
was for me to crawl
through their legs

15:35.166 --> 15:37.567
while they gave me my birthday wax.

15:39.266 --> 15:41.934
Well, and you're not
going to believe this--

15:42.000 --> 15:46.266
it turns out they weren't
druid priests at all.

15:46.767 --> 15:50.400
Just a bunch of shriners
looking for a good time.

15:51.300 --> 15:54.800
All creatures must learn to coexist.

15:54.867 --> 15:58.967
Back where I come from, they do.

15:59.033 --> 16:02.233
That's why the brown bear
and the field mouse

16:02.300 --> 16:06.233
can share their lives
and live in harmony.

16:06.300 --> 16:09.166
Of course, they can't mate,
or the mice would explode.

16:13.734 --> 16:15.233
You want me to drive tonight, Dorothy?

16:15.300 --> 16:19.367
Listen, I'm not going
to the meeting tonight.

16:19.433 --> 16:20.700
Well, how come?

16:20.767 --> 16:22.667
I'm not comfortable there.

16:22.734 --> 16:25.767
I'm not comfortable with the people,
or with the whole thing.

16:25.834 --> 16:27.934
But you need
the group support, Dorothy.

16:27.967 --> 16:30.533
It's not a good idea to go it alone.

16:30.600 --> 16:33.667
Did I ever tell you about my cousin?

16:35.667 --> 16:39.000
He tried to go it alone
in a three-legged race.

16:39.066 --> 16:40.800
Well--

16:40.867 --> 16:44.867
Please, Rose, I don't want to hear
about your cousin.

16:48.133 --> 16:51.033
That was very interesting, Rose,

16:51.100 --> 16:56.934
but now that I've heard you, I think
I'll, uh... probably just plead insanity.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.467
You look perfectly sane to me.

16:59.533 --> 17:01.867
High praise, indeed.

17:05.834 --> 17:08.233
When I go to trial,

17:08.300 --> 17:10.000
will you be a character witness?

17:10.066 --> 17:14.367
Tell them I'm sweet and cute
and couldn't harm a fly.

17:14.433 --> 17:16.600
You want me to perjure myself?

17:16.667 --> 17:17.867
Basically.

17:17.934 --> 17:21.300
Ma, don't worry.
Everything's going to be fine.

17:21.367 --> 17:23.767
Thanks for trying to cheer me up.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.600
You're always there for me.

17:25.667 --> 17:27.300
I appreciate that.

17:27.367 --> 17:29.533
We're there for each other.

17:29.600 --> 17:32.967
I don't know of any other
mothers and daughters

17:33.033 --> 17:36.367
who've gone through half
of what we've gone through.

17:36.433 --> 17:39.867
It meant so much to me
when you and I...

17:39.934 --> 17:42.266
2 1/2 hours. I thought you died.

17:42.333 --> 17:45.734
-What's wrong with you?
-Nothing.

17:45.800 --> 17:46.734
Who are you?

17:46.800 --> 17:48.700
I'm the doctor.

17:48.767 --> 17:50.433
We'll see about that.

17:51.467 --> 17:53.266
Uh, look, Mrs., uh...

17:53.333 --> 17:55.467
Petrillo. I'm Dorothy's mother.

17:55.533 --> 17:59.100
Don't tell me nothing's wrong,
because I know there's something wrong.

17:59.166 --> 18:02.200
-Mothers know.
-Ma, we'll talk later.

18:02.266 --> 18:04.533
Your daughter is fine, Mrs. Petrillo.

18:04.600 --> 18:05.433
100%?

18:05.500 --> 18:07.533
-100%.
-Tiptop.

18:07.600 --> 18:11.433
Then why the hell
does she feel like hell?

18:12.266 --> 18:14.033
-Look, Ma...
-I got to hear this.

18:14.100 --> 18:15.500
It could be functional.

18:15.567 --> 18:16.767
Functional?

18:16.834 --> 18:19.834
-Mental.
-Mental?

18:19.900 --> 18:22.133
Well, let me tell you something,

18:22.200 --> 18:25.033
Mr. 100% tiptop mental.

18:25.100 --> 18:27.700
My daughter may be no spring chicken,

18:27.767 --> 18:30.633
and her jaw might crack
when she chews...

18:33.000 --> 18:37.433
and she may have noticeable trouble
digesting raw vegetables...

18:38.767 --> 18:41.967
but one thing she's not is mental.

18:43.100 --> 18:44.200
Thanks, Ma.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.934
Okay, girls, I'm ready.

19:00.700 --> 19:03.767
Well, Rose, do I look like
the mayor of Palm Springs?

19:07.433 --> 19:10.867
Doug Henning is the mayor
of Palm Springs?

19:14.066 --> 19:16.233
Just play the music, Rose.

19:18.133 --> 19:20.433
(upbeat music playing)

19:46.200 --> 19:48.100
<i>♪ They say we're young ♪</i>

19:48.166 --> 19:49.533
<i>♪ And we don't know ♪</i>

19:49.600 --> 19:51.166
<i>♪ We won't find out ♪</i>

19:51.233 --> 19:53.800
<i>♪ Until we grow ♪</i>

19:55.433 --> 19:58.333
<i>♪ I don't know if all that's true ♪</i>

19:58.400 --> 19:59.967
<i>♪ But you got me ♪</i>

20:00.033 --> 20:02.400
<i>♪ And, baby, I got you ♪</i>

20:04.266 --> 20:06.667
♪ Babe ♪

20:06.734 --> 20:09.500
<i>♪ I got you, babe ♪</i>

20:09.567 --> 20:12.133
<i>♪ I got you, babe ♪</i>

20:12.200 --> 20:15.600
You know, Ma, I guess we do have
a good relationship.

20:15.667 --> 20:17.433
It's always been good.

20:17.500 --> 20:19.867
I know we never did
mother-daughter things,

20:19.934 --> 20:21.600
baking cookies,
dressing alike,

20:21.667 --> 20:23.233
braiding each other's hair.

20:23.300 --> 20:26.900
Wasn't it great
making fun of those who did?

20:26.967 --> 20:28.633
It sure was.

20:28.700 --> 20:30.200
But come on, Ma.

20:30.266 --> 20:33.600
We have done
our share of fighting.

20:33.667 --> 20:36.467
Of course we fight.
We're Italian. We like to fight.

20:36.533 --> 20:38.266
It's how we show love.

20:38.333 --> 20:41.400
I don't know if there was love
that time...

20:41.467 --> 20:43.166
-Hi, Ma.
-Give me your watch.

20:43.233 --> 20:44.667
Sure. Why?

20:44.734 --> 20:47.400
I'm working on a magic act.

20:50.600 --> 20:53.433
Abracadabra, 1, 2, 3.

20:56.667 --> 20:58.333
Ma!

20:58.400 --> 20:59.600
Relax.

21:00.233 --> 21:03.133
Dorothy, was your card the ace of spades?

21:04.533 --> 21:06.467
What the hell are you talking about?

21:07.433 --> 21:10.367
I think I got chapters 7 and 9 mixed up.

21:14.900 --> 21:17.633
This watch is broken.

21:18.266 --> 21:21.567
Stan gave me that watch
when we got married.

21:21.633 --> 21:24.166
The marriage never worked.
Why should the watch?

21:26.567 --> 21:29.800
I waited up for you until 2 a.m.,

21:29.867 --> 21:31.767
and you still weren't home.

21:31.834 --> 21:36.033
Gertie and I and the girls
went to Wolfie's to pick up guys.

21:38.133 --> 21:41.433
I called Wolfie's at 11:00.
You weren't there.

21:41.500 --> 21:42.600
Guess who got lucky?

21:42.667 --> 21:43.767
Oh, god.

21:46.834 --> 21:50.967
A couple of egg creams,
the bright fluorescent lights,

21:51.033 --> 21:52.967
and a retired jeweler named Shlomo

21:53.033 --> 21:55.633
all conspired to make
a night of enchantment.

21:57.233 --> 21:58.900
Not for me.

21:58.967 --> 22:01.800
I can't tell you the horrible
thoughts I had

22:01.867 --> 22:03.400
about what might have happened,

22:03.467 --> 22:06.867
although none as horrible
as what you just described.

22:07.667 --> 22:11.467
Ma, I scheduled the appointment
for your checkup.

22:13.967 --> 22:16.367
You know you have
to have a physical.

22:17.400 --> 22:20.800
Should I take you to court,
have you declared incompetent?

22:20.867 --> 22:22.367
I'm not incompetent.

22:22.433 --> 22:23.934
Once when I laughed too hard,

22:24.000 --> 22:25.500
I had a little accident.

22:30.867 --> 22:35.300
We do have a strange way
of showing our affection.

22:35.367 --> 22:37.500
Ma, I'm glad to see you've cheered up.

22:37.567 --> 22:40.367
Why are you suddenly
walking down memory lane?

22:40.433 --> 22:43.166
I may not see you
for a while.

22:43.233 --> 22:47.467
They can't prove you started that fire
at Shady Pines,

22:47.533 --> 22:49.800
and you're not going to jail.

22:49.867 --> 22:52.633
You can't be sure of that,

22:52.700 --> 22:55.066
so I'm doing what I have to do...

22:56.600 --> 22:59.633
I'm jumping bail
and moving back to Sicily.

23:10.700 --> 23:14.200
(theme music playing)
