00:44.691 --> 00:46.955
# My soul is a witness #

00:47.027 --> 00:48.654
# Soul is a witness #

00:48.729 --> 00:50.629
- # My soul is a witness #
- # Yeah, yeah #

00:50.697 --> 00:52.494
- # Soul is a witness #
- # Oh, yeah #

00:52.566 --> 00:54.557
- # Before I go #
- # Oh #

00:54.634 --> 00:56.261
- # Before I go #
- # 'Fore I go #

00:56.336 --> 00:59.897
# Before I go, soul is a witness #

00:59.973 --> 01:02.203
Heavenly Father, we come before Thee,

01:02.275 --> 01:05.310
knee bent and body bowed

01:05.345 --> 01:07.836
in the humblest way
that we know how.

01:07.914 --> 01:11.611
Father, who controls
and knows all things,

01:11.718 --> 01:16.382
both the living
and dying of all creatures.

01:16.456 --> 01:21.291
Give us the strength and the wisdom
to do Thy work.

01:21.361 --> 01:23.795
In God's name we pray.

01:23.864 --> 01:27.197
And all God's people say, "Amen."

01:27.267 --> 01:28.825
- # My soul is a witness #
- Amen.

01:28.902 --> 01:30.369
- # Water, wine #
- # So high #

01:30.437 --> 01:32.530
- # Water, wine #
- # Wine #

01:32.606 --> 01:35.166
# Water, wine, soul is a witness #

01:35.242 --> 01:37.540
# Soul is a witness #

01:37.611 --> 01:39.044
# Soul is a witness #

01:39.112 --> 01:41.080
- # Soul #
- # Soul is a witness #

01:41.148 --> 01:42.638
- # Soul #
- # Witness #

01:42.716 --> 01:44.513
- # Witness #
- # Witness #

01:44.618 --> 01:46.916
- # Witness #

01:46.987 --> 01:49.046
- # Witness #
- # Soul is a witness #

01:49.156 --> 01:51.147
When Agave sobered up,

01:51.258 --> 01:53.021
she looked down and saw
the head of her son Pentheus

01:53.093 --> 01:56.119
- right there in her hands.
- She thought he was a wild animal.

01:56.196 --> 01:57.993
That's how Dionysus got his revenge.

01:58.064 --> 02:00.396
You a heathen, Henry.

02:00.467 --> 02:01.957
You know what I got right here?

02:02.035 --> 02:04.629
- What?
- Some of that very wine.

02:04.704 --> 02:09.971
"When I was a child, I spake as a child.

02:11.545 --> 02:14.514
"I understood as a child.

02:14.614 --> 02:18.050
"I thought as a child.

02:18.151 --> 02:21.211
"But when I became a man,

02:22.255 --> 02:23.813
I put away all childish things."

02:30.997 --> 02:32.897
- # Early one mornin' #
- # Early one mornin' #

02:32.966 --> 02:34.399
- # Down the road #
- # Early one mornin' #

02:34.468 --> 02:36.629
- # Early one mornin' #
- # Early one mornin' #

02:36.703 --> 02:39.365
# Down the road #

02:47.681 --> 02:49.649
Freshman class...

02:49.716 --> 02:54.779
I believe we are the most privileged
people in America,

02:54.888 --> 03:00.827
because we have
the most important job

03:00.894 --> 03:03.158
in America:

03:03.230 --> 03:07.257
the education of our young people.

03:07.334 --> 03:09.495
# I was traveling #

03:09.569 --> 03:11.127
# Partner too #

03:11.204 --> 03:12.831
# Goin' down the road #

03:12.906 --> 03:14.874
# Goin' down to say #

03:14.941 --> 03:16.408
# My soul is a witness #

03:16.476 --> 03:18.637
- # Souls are born #
- # Goin' home #

03:18.712 --> 03:20.077
- # Soul is a witness #
- # Goin' home #

03:20.146 --> 03:22.410
# Souls are born #

03:22.516 --> 03:24.245
- # Soul is a witness #
- # Witness #

03:24.351 --> 03:26.182
- # Before I go #
- # When I go #

03:26.253 --> 03:27.345
- # Before I go #
- # Go #

03:35.562 --> 03:37.154
Trudell!

03:38.665 --> 03:41.099
- Who the hell is he?
- Oh, he's just my husband.

03:45.205 --> 03:47.070
I'm gonna cut your head off.

03:47.140 --> 03:52.442
We must impress upon our young people

03:52.512 --> 03:56.471
that there will be difficulties
that they face.

03:56.550 --> 03:58.609
Come on, Trudell.
Come get this whuppin', boy.

03:58.718 --> 04:00.652
- Get him down, Trudell.
- Scared, ain't ya?

04:00.754 --> 04:02.847
Huh? You with the razor
and twice my size?

04:02.956 --> 04:05.288
They must defeat them!

04:08.461 --> 04:15.264
They must do what they have to do
in order to do what they want to do.

04:15.335 --> 04:17.269
Come on, now.

04:17.337 --> 04:18.894
Come on, baby!

04:20.473 --> 04:24.910
Education is the only way out.

04:26.246 --> 04:29.477
Come on, baby. Get up!
Get up, baby. Come on!

04:29.583 --> 04:32.450
The way out of ignorance--

04:32.519 --> 04:34.180
Like cuttin' people, huh, boy?

04:34.287 --> 04:36.255
Want to cut people, Trudell, huh?

04:37.624 --> 04:39.854
Get your hands off me!

04:39.926 --> 04:41.917
The way out of darkness!

04:47.667 --> 04:51.068
lnto...

04:51.137 --> 04:53.935
the glorious light.

05:40.120 --> 05:41.849
Come on, now! Give it back!

05:41.921 --> 05:44.287
- Give it back!
- "To our precious Hamilton--"

05:44.357 --> 05:46.621
This isn't funny. Come on.
Dunbar, give it back.

05:46.693 --> 05:49.628
Who do you think you are?
Jesse Owens?

06:09.816 --> 06:12.341
Have a seat.

06:15.555 --> 06:18.524
"I am...

06:18.625 --> 06:21.253
"the darker brother.

06:21.327 --> 06:23.818
"They send me to eat in the kitchen
when company comes.

06:23.897 --> 06:26.297
"But I laugh, and I eat well,

06:26.366 --> 06:29.401
"and I grow strong.

06:29.436 --> 06:32.997
"Tomorrow, I will sit at the table
when company comes.

06:33.073 --> 06:35.064
"Nobody'll dare say to me,

06:35.141 --> 06:37.109
"'Eat in the kitchen' then.

06:37.177 --> 06:42.114
"Besides, they'll see how beautiful I am,

06:42.182 --> 06:44.673
"and be ashamed.

06:44.751 --> 06:49.188
I, too, am America."

06:49.255 --> 06:51.280
Who wrote that?

06:53.760 --> 06:55.159
Langston Hughes, 1924.

06:55.228 --> 06:57.662
1925.

06:58.865 --> 07:05.327
"Hating you shall be a game
played with cool hands."

07:06.606 --> 07:11.543
"Memory will lay its hands
upon your breast,

07:11.611 --> 07:15.843
and you will understand my hatred."

07:15.949 --> 07:18.543
Gwendolyn Bennett wrote that.

07:18.651 --> 07:21.755
She was born in 1902.

07:21.790 --> 07:24.383
Unofficially.

07:24.457 --> 07:26.254
You see, in most states,

07:26.326 --> 07:28.123
Negroes were denied birth certificates,

07:28.194 --> 07:30.788
which means I can
lie about my age the rest of my life.

07:32.232 --> 07:34.496
You think that's funny?

07:36.069 --> 07:38.299
To be born...

07:38.371 --> 07:40.498
without record.

07:41.641 --> 07:44.405
Mr. Reed, hand these out.

07:44.477 --> 07:47.105
I'm going to introduce you
to some new voices this semester.

07:47.180 --> 07:49.546
There's a revolution going on.

07:49.649 --> 07:51.947
In the North. In Harlem.

07:52.051 --> 07:54.576
They're changing the way
Negroes in America think.

07:54.687 --> 07:57.884
I'm talking about poets
like Hughes, Bennett,

07:57.957 --> 08:00.323
Zora Neale Hurston, Countee Cullen--

08:00.460 --> 08:02.985
"Some are teethed on a silver spoon,

08:03.029 --> 08:05.827
"with the stars strung up for a rattle.

08:05.865 --> 08:08.231
"I cut my teeth
as a black raccoon--

08:08.301 --> 08:10.735
...for implements of battle."

08:17.944 --> 08:19.935
Meet me after class.

08:31.124 --> 08:33.751
What's a professor doing
in the middle of the night

08:33.827 --> 08:35.488
dressed like a cotton-chopper?

08:35.562 --> 08:37.621
What is a student doing
in the middle of the night

08:37.697 --> 08:38.857
throwing his life away?

08:38.932 --> 08:40.900
It's funny. I thought
I was defending myself.

08:40.967 --> 08:43.332
Mm.

08:43.403 --> 08:46.600
I remember you.

08:46.673 --> 08:49.335
Couple of years ago.
Then you disappeared.

08:49.409 --> 08:50.501
What happened?

08:50.577 --> 08:53.375
I come and go whenever it suits me.

08:53.446 --> 08:55.505
- Suspensions?
- Leaves of absence.

08:57.417 --> 08:58.850
Why'd you come back?

08:58.918 --> 09:01.284
School's the only place
you can read all day.

09:01.354 --> 09:03.322
Except prison.

09:05.825 --> 09:07.986
I want you to come by
my house tonight, 7:30.

09:08.061 --> 09:09.995
- Corner of June and Campus.
- Why would I do that?

09:10.063 --> 09:12.293
Holding tryouts for the debate team.

09:14.801 --> 09:17.998
- You sure you want somebody like me?
- No.

09:18.071 --> 09:20.631
That's why you're trying out.

09:20.707 --> 09:22.197
7:30.

09:22.275 --> 09:24.038
June and Campus.

09:49.035 --> 09:53.096
"Driven by the wind and tossed--"

09:55.375 --> 09:57.400
Do well tonight, Junior.

10:01.814 --> 10:04.112
Of the 360 students here at Wiley College,

10:04.217 --> 10:08.313
only 45 of you were brave enough
to try out for the debate team.

10:08.421 --> 10:11.117
Of that 45, only four
of you will remain standing

10:11.190 --> 10:13.283
when the tryouts are over-- why?

10:13.359 --> 10:16.487
Because debate is
blood sport. It's combat.

10:16.562 --> 10:18.723
But your weapons are words.

10:18.798 --> 10:20.163
Come on in.

10:20.233 --> 10:22.394
Now that Mr. Farmer
has joined us, we can begin.

10:22.468 --> 10:23.765
Sit down, Mr. Farmer.

10:23.836 --> 10:26.202
Not right there. Over there.

10:26.272 --> 10:28.103
- Yes, sir.
- James. Right this way.

10:28.174 --> 10:30.233
Good evening, Mrs. Tolson.

10:30.310 --> 10:32.278
- Evening.
- Excuse me.

10:32.345 --> 10:33.744
We're waiting for you, Mr. Farmer.

10:33.813 --> 10:35.280
I'm going, sir.

10:35.381 --> 10:38.748
Thank you, Mr. Farmer.
You smell very good, Mr. Farmer.

10:38.818 --> 10:41.184
- Thank you, sir.
- You're very welcome.

10:41.254 --> 10:43.051
Gentlemen and lady.

10:43.122 --> 10:45.352
This is...

10:45.425 --> 10:49.418
the hot spot.

10:49.495 --> 10:53.363
You will enter it at your own risk.

10:53.433 --> 10:55.628
Mr. Tolson, what about
the debaters from last year?

10:55.702 --> 10:57.192
Don't ask a question you
already know the answer to.

10:57.270 --> 10:58.532
Get up here. You'll be first.

10:58.604 --> 11:00.196
Get right here. Hot spot.

11:00.273 --> 11:02.298
Debate starts with a proposition.

11:02.375 --> 11:03.899
With an idea-- "Resolved:

11:03.977 --> 11:07.708
Child labor should be regulated
by the federal government."

11:07.780 --> 11:09.839
The first debater argues
the affirmative.

11:09.949 --> 11:11.576
Affirmative means
that you are for something.

11:11.684 --> 11:13.208
Mr. Reed will argue the affirmative.

11:13.319 --> 11:14.946
The second debater
argues the negative.

11:15.054 --> 11:16.487
Negative means that you are what?

11:16.556 --> 11:17.488
Against.

11:17.557 --> 11:19.388
Brilliant, Mr. Burgess.

11:19.459 --> 11:22.428
You shall argue
the affirmative, Mr. Reed. Go.

11:22.495 --> 11:26.989
Well, sir, I'd begin with a quote
from the poet Cleghorn.

11:27.066 --> 11:31.264
"The golf links lie so near the mill,

11:31.337 --> 11:34.636
"that almost every day,

11:34.707 --> 11:38.302
"the laboring children
can look out and--

11:38.378 --> 11:40.243
and--"

11:40.313 --> 11:44.044
# And watch the men at play #

11:44.150 --> 11:46.618
ls that what you learned
from last year, Mr. Reed?

11:46.686 --> 11:48.950
To start something,
and not finish it?

11:49.022 --> 11:50.580
- ls it?
- No, sir.

11:50.690 --> 11:52.351
Sit down.

11:55.828 --> 11:58.854
Who's next? You? Stand up.

11:58.931 --> 12:01.331
Stand up.

12:02.769 --> 12:05.135
It's getting late.
How much longer can you hide?

12:05.204 --> 12:07.638
I'm not hiding, sir.
I transferred from my college

12:07.707 --> 12:09.334
just to come here
and try out for your team.

12:09.409 --> 12:10.740
I am deeply moved. What's your name?

12:10.810 --> 12:12.300
Samantha Booke.

12:12.378 --> 12:13.675
- Book?
- With an "e."

12:13.746 --> 12:17.204
Arise, Miss Booke. With an "e."

12:18.251 --> 12:22.654
Into the hot spot,
Miss Booke with an "e."

12:22.722 --> 12:26.715
You know, there's never been a female
on the debating team, ever.

12:26.793 --> 12:28.420
Yes, sir. I know that.

12:28.494 --> 12:30.860
What makes you think
you should be the first?

12:30.930 --> 12:33.194
Because, sir, I am just as qualified as--

12:33.266 --> 12:34.995
- Quit stammering, Miss Booke.
- ...anybody else here.

12:35.068 --> 12:36.797
- My gender has nothing--
- "Resolved:

12:36.869 --> 12:39.633
Welfare discourages hard work."

12:39.705 --> 12:42.833
- You'll argue the negative.
- All right.

12:42.909 --> 12:46.606
Welfare takes away a man's
strongest reason for working,

12:46.679 --> 12:49.273
which is survival.

12:49.382 --> 12:50.940
And that weakens the will of the poor.

12:51.050 --> 12:54.153
How would you rebut that,
Miss Booke with an "e"?

12:54.188 --> 12:56.246
I would say it does not.

12:56.355 --> 12:59.415
Most of the New Deal
goes to children, anyway,

12:59.492 --> 13:01.653
and to the handicapped,
and to old people--

13:01.727 --> 13:03.160
- ls that fact, or conjecture?
- It is a fact.

13:03.229 --> 13:05.629
- Speak up.
- It is a fact.

13:05.698 --> 13:07.461
- What's your source?
- The president.

13:07.533 --> 13:09.899
- Of the United States?
- Yes, sir.

13:09.969 --> 13:13.132
That's your primary source? You spoke
to President Roosevelt personally?

13:13.206 --> 13:15.606
Of course not. I did not
speak to him personally,

13:15.675 --> 13:17.267
but I listened to his Fireside Chat.

13:17.343 --> 13:20.244
- Oh, a radio broadcast.
- Yes.

13:20.313 --> 13:22.474
- Any other sources?
- Well--

13:22.582 --> 13:24.550
Any other sources?

13:26.886 --> 13:28.979
Yes, there are other sources.

13:29.088 --> 13:31.784
Like that look in a mother's eyes
when she can't feed her kids.

13:31.858 --> 13:35.294
Without welfare, Mr. Tolson,
people would be starving.

13:35.361 --> 13:36.521
Who's starving, Miss Booke?

13:36.596 --> 13:38.962
- The unemployed are starving.
- Mr. Burgess here.

13:39.031 --> 13:41.397
He's unemployed.
Obviously, he's not starving.

13:43.236 --> 13:45.500
I drew you in, Miss Booke.

13:45.571 --> 13:49.302
You gave a faulty premise,
so your syllogism fell apart.

13:49.375 --> 13:51.309
- "Syllogism"?
- Your logic fell apart.

13:51.377 --> 13:53.345
Major premise:
the unemployed are starving.

13:53.412 --> 13:55.903
Minor premise:
Mr. Burgess is unemployed.

13:56.015 --> 13:58.506
Conclusion: Mr. Burgess is starving.

13:58.618 --> 14:01.451
Your major premise was
based on a faulty assumption.

14:01.521 --> 14:04.319
Classic fallacy. Who's next?

14:11.697 --> 14:13.858
You were right.

14:13.933 --> 14:15.161
Tell us your name.

14:15.234 --> 14:17.532
I'm Henry Lowe. With an "e."

14:18.571 --> 14:21.540
All right, Mr. Lowe. I will name a subject.

14:21.607 --> 14:24.303
You speak a few words--
a pertinent quote from world literature.

14:24.377 --> 14:25.605
Go ahead.

14:27.914 --> 14:28.938
Beauty.

14:30.950 --> 14:32.440
"I heard the old, old men say,

14:32.552 --> 14:34.918
all that is beautiful
drifts away, like the waters."

14:35.988 --> 14:37.387
Very good.

14:37.456 --> 14:40.653
History. And name
the author this time.

14:40.726 --> 14:43.820
"History is a nightmare,
from which I am trying to awake."

14:43.896 --> 14:45.261
James Joyce.

14:48.367 --> 14:50.028
Self-pity.

14:53.272 --> 14:57.504
"I never saw a wild thing
sorry for itself."

14:57.577 --> 14:58.874
D.H. Lawrence.

15:00.680 --> 15:03.513
I love D.H. Lawrence. Have you ever read--

15:03.549 --> 15:04.607
Mr. Farmer.

15:04.717 --> 15:06.776
Yes, sir?

15:06.886 --> 15:10.322
I have eyes in the back of my head
and ears on both sides. Stand up.

15:12.758 --> 15:17.127
Tell me the irony in the name
"Bethlehem Steel Corporation."

15:19.165 --> 15:23.465
Bethlehem is the birthplace of Jesus,
Prince of Peace,

15:23.536 --> 15:26.369
and Bethlehem Steel
makes weapons of war.

15:26.439 --> 15:28.907
Very good. Sit down.

15:30.076 --> 15:31.065
Good.

15:31.143 --> 15:32.838
Who's next?

15:32.979 --> 15:34.776
That went well.
How will we know how we did?

15:34.847 --> 15:37.509
Samantha.

15:39.085 --> 15:41.053
Samantha.

15:43.422 --> 15:45.617
Tolson's tough, isn't he?

15:45.691 --> 15:47.682
He sure is.

15:48.894 --> 15:51.761
I'm James.

15:51.831 --> 15:53.890
ls your father Dr. James Farmer?

15:53.966 --> 15:55.957
Yes... yes, he is.

15:56.035 --> 15:59.436
I'm taking theology from him,
and that man speaks in tongues.

15:59.505 --> 16:01.564
French, Greek, Hebrew, Latin--

16:01.641 --> 16:03.302
How many languages
does he speak?

16:03.376 --> 16:07.472
- Seven languages.
- "Seven languages."

16:07.546 --> 16:10.379
He must be the smartest man in Texas.

16:10.483 --> 16:12.383
Well, that's not saying much.

16:13.519 --> 16:16.488
So why do you want
to be on the team?

16:16.555 --> 16:20.150
- I think it would be good training.
- For what?

16:20.226 --> 16:22.558
Bein' a lawyer.

16:22.628 --> 16:25.188
Lawyer? That's great.

16:25.264 --> 16:28.131
You know how many Negro
women practice law in this state?

16:28.200 --> 16:29.462
- Two.
- Exactly.

16:29.535 --> 16:31.560
One of them's my aunt.

16:31.637 --> 16:34.265
Well, look at you, Mr. Farmer.

16:34.340 --> 16:35.898
How old are you, anyway?

16:35.975 --> 16:38.569
I'll be 16...

16:38.644 --> 16:39.906
in 21 months.

16:39.979 --> 16:44.313
Young lady. James.
I just wanted to thank you.

16:44.417 --> 16:46.112
For what?

16:46.218 --> 16:47.810
Well, for your performance tonight.

16:47.920 --> 16:49.979
I mean, how many other students
ever stand up to Tolson?

16:50.089 --> 16:51.351
- I did.
- No.

16:51.424 --> 16:54.723
You answered a question,
and I spouted a few quotes.

16:54.794 --> 16:56.819
Miss Booke with an "e,"

16:56.896 --> 16:59.831
- she fought back.
- And lost!

16:59.899 --> 17:02.060
But you didn't have to lose.

17:02.134 --> 17:05.228
Why isn't a Fireside Chat
a legitimate source?

17:05.304 --> 17:07.704
Because Tolson says so?

17:07.772 --> 17:12.436
Nobody has better access
to those statistics than the president.

17:12.511 --> 17:16.914
Now, if you'd have called Tolson on that,
you would have won.

17:17.016 --> 17:21.749
I don't know. I'm sure that man
would have come up with something.

17:21.820 --> 17:23.584
Good night, James.

17:23.656 --> 17:25.317
Can you believe he's

17:25.391 --> 17:27.450
- Good night, Samantha.
- 14 years old, and he's in college?

17:29.762 --> 17:32.526
You are gifted, all of you.

17:32.598 --> 17:35.066
So I want you to know that I chose
this team for balance,

17:35.134 --> 17:38.160
and none of you should
take it as a failure...

17:38.237 --> 17:40.364
as a denigration of your intellect.

17:40.439 --> 17:41.770
Denigrate. There's a word for you.

17:41.841 --> 17:44.776
From the Latin word "niger,"
to defame, to blacken.

17:44.844 --> 17:46.869
It's always there, isn't it?
Even in the dictionary.

17:46.946 --> 17:50.404
Even in the speech
of a Negro professor.

17:50.516 --> 17:54.646
Somehow, "black" is always
equated with failure.

17:54.754 --> 17:57.279
Well, write your own dictionary.

17:57.390 --> 17:59.858
And mark this as a new beginning,

17:59.925 --> 18:02.655
whether you make the team or not.

18:02.728 --> 18:07.893
The Wiley College Forensics
Society of 1935-1936 is as follows:

18:07.967 --> 18:10.595
The debaters...

18:10.669 --> 18:13.467
will be Mr. Hamilton Burgess
from last year's team--

18:13.539 --> 18:17.270
- Yea!
- Sit down, Mr. Burgess.

18:18.277 --> 18:21.474
Mr. Henry Lowe.

18:21.547 --> 18:23.447
Our alternates.

18:23.549 --> 18:26.882
Miss Samantha Booke. With an "e."

18:28.220 --> 18:30.882
And finally--

18:32.224 --> 18:34.488
Junior, slow down.

18:34.560 --> 18:36.653
- Where's Dad?
- Quiet. He's writing a lecture.

18:40.733 --> 18:42.667
- Dad.
- Junior.

18:42.735 --> 18:45.932
What is the greatest
weakness of man?

18:48.474 --> 18:50.601
Not believing? Doubt?

18:51.610 --> 18:55.068
That's it. Thank you, Junior.

18:55.147 --> 18:56.774
Matthew 14:31.

18:56.882 --> 18:59.476
- That will be the lesson.
- Dad.

18:59.585 --> 19:04.522
"O you of little faith,
why do you doubt me?"

19:04.623 --> 19:06.318
Dad?

19:06.392 --> 19:07.791
What is it, son?

19:07.860 --> 19:10.385
I made the debate team.

19:10.463 --> 19:12.556
Well, congratulations.

19:12.631 --> 19:14.531
And who is on your team?

19:14.600 --> 19:17.967
Um, there's four of us.
I'm one of the alternates.

19:18.971 --> 19:19.960
Who's ahead of you?

19:20.039 --> 19:22.530
Hamilton Burgess and Henry Lowe.

19:22.608 --> 19:25.236
And the other alternate's
Samantha Booke.

19:25.311 --> 19:26.972
There's a girl?

19:27.046 --> 19:29.241
She wants to be a lawyer.

19:29.348 --> 19:32.112
- A lawyer?
- She's very intelligent.

19:34.687 --> 19:36.814
ls she pretty?

19:36.922 --> 19:40.187
I don't know.
I never really noticed.

19:40.259 --> 19:43.285
Because extracurricular activities
like the debate team are fine,

19:43.362 --> 19:45.796
but you must not take
your eye off the ball, son.

19:45.865 --> 19:49.164
- Yes, sir.
- Hmph.

19:49.235 --> 19:52.102
So what do we do here?

19:52.171 --> 19:55.504
We do what we have to do,
so we can do what we want to do.

19:55.574 --> 19:58.008
What do you have to do right now?

19:58.077 --> 19:59.908
- My homework.
- So get to it.

19:59.979 --> 20:01.571
Yes, sir.

20:11.323 --> 20:14.258
My daddy owns a grocery store
that has apples, bananas, cookies,

20:14.326 --> 20:16.226
doughnuts, eggs, figs,

20:16.295 --> 20:18.490
and "gonzola" beans.

20:18.564 --> 20:21.431
Right. What's a gonzola bean?

20:21.500 --> 20:23.559
- Hogwash!
- Hogwash!

20:23.636 --> 20:24.660
"Gonzola" bean?

20:24.770 --> 20:27.771
Ready, set, go!

20:27.806 --> 20:30.832
- Apricots, uh--
- Hogwash.

20:30.910 --> 20:32.377
What, no apricots?

20:32.444 --> 20:34.674
Look out!

20:38.450 --> 20:39.917
What was that?

20:40.019 --> 20:41.748
I'm not sure.

20:51.230 --> 20:52.697
Sit down.

20:52.765 --> 20:55.199
You stay put.

20:55.267 --> 20:57.258
Be still.

21:04.677 --> 21:06.577
What is it?

21:06.645 --> 21:08.306
It's a pig.

21:08.380 --> 21:10.075
Hit a pig.

21:10.182 --> 21:11.911
Shut up, dog!

21:12.017 --> 21:13.746
Junior, get in the car.

21:13.852 --> 21:15.786
What the hell happened to my hog?

21:15.854 --> 21:18.186
Sorry about that.
Came out of nowhere.

21:18.257 --> 21:19.451
I didn't see it coming.

21:19.525 --> 21:21.425
You done killed my hog, boy.

21:21.493 --> 21:24.121
Truly sorry. Gladly pay you for it.

21:24.196 --> 21:27.063
How much--
How much you want?

21:29.201 --> 21:31.328
It's gonna cost you $25.

21:32.671 --> 21:35.333
Only have a few bucks on me
right now, but I can--

21:43.716 --> 21:45.809
I do have a check.

21:45.918 --> 21:47.977
My monthly check,
for Wiley College in Marshall.

21:48.087 --> 21:51.318
It's for $17.36.

21:51.390 --> 21:53.654
You may have that.

21:53.726 --> 21:55.660
I will endorse that over to you.

21:57.630 --> 22:00.224
You'll do what?

22:00.299 --> 22:02.392
I will sign the check over to you.

22:02.468 --> 22:05.062
Well, let me see it.

22:05.137 --> 22:08.629
It's in the car, with my wife.

22:08.707 --> 22:11.198
Gonna walk to the car now.

22:14.947 --> 22:16.972
Junior, get in the car.

22:23.088 --> 22:26.057
Give me that salary check, Pearl.

22:26.125 --> 22:27.888
We need that money, James.

22:27.960 --> 22:29.120
Just give me the check.

22:29.194 --> 22:31.389
Go on.

22:33.732 --> 22:35.893
His wife has it.

22:37.369 --> 22:38.597
I thought it was in here.

22:38.671 --> 22:40.229
Just relax. It's all right.

22:40.305 --> 22:41.636
It's in here. You'll find it.

22:44.109 --> 22:46.577
Here it is.

22:49.648 --> 22:51.343
Here it is.

22:54.019 --> 22:56.487
That check better be good, boy.

22:56.588 --> 22:58.556
It's good.

23:04.329 --> 23:06.126
Well, pick it up!

23:19.111 --> 23:22.444
Here it is.

23:22.548 --> 23:24.311
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Where the hell do you think you're going?

23:24.416 --> 23:27.283
You got to help us
get this hog in my truck.

23:27.352 --> 23:29.149
Come on. Grab the tail end of that, boy.

23:33.125 --> 23:34.649
All right, on three.

23:34.727 --> 23:37.355
One, two, three!

23:37.429 --> 23:40.091
Town niggers. They think
they're too good to get their hands dirty.

23:57.349 --> 24:00.682
- Dad--
- I told you to get in the car.

24:00.819 --> 24:03.788
When I tell you to do
something, Junior, you do it.

24:06.892 --> 24:07.950
Who's the judge?

24:08.026 --> 24:09.550
The judge is God.

24:09.628 --> 24:10.925
Why is he God?

24:10.996 --> 24:13.430
Because he decides
who wins or loses,

24:13.499 --> 24:14.591
not my opponent.

24:14.666 --> 24:15.690
Who is your opponent?

24:15.768 --> 24:17.235
He doesn't exist.

24:17.302 --> 24:18.929
Why does he not exist?

24:19.004 --> 24:21.768
He's merely a dissenting voice
to the truth I speak.

24:21.974 --> 24:23.669
Who's the judge?

24:23.709 --> 24:25.677
- The judge is God!
- The judge is God!

24:25.711 --> 24:27.201
Why is he God?

24:27.279 --> 24:30.612
Because he decides who wins or loses,
not my opponent!

24:30.716 --> 24:31.614
Who is your opponent?

24:31.717 --> 24:33.480
He doesn't exist!

24:33.585 --> 24:35.143
Why doesn't he exist?

24:35.254 --> 24:38.883
Because he is merely a dissenting voice
to the truth I speak!

24:40.793 --> 24:41.782
Who's the judge?

24:41.860 --> 24:43.259
The judge is God!

24:43.328 --> 24:44.556
Why is he God?

24:44.630 --> 24:48.396
Because he decides who wins or loses,
not my opponent!

24:48.467 --> 24:49.661
Who's your opponent?

24:49.735 --> 24:50.929
He doesn't exist!

24:51.003 --> 24:52.527
Why does he not exist?

24:52.604 --> 24:56.131
Because he is merely a dissenting voice
to the truth I speak!

24:56.208 --> 24:57.505
Who's the judge?

24:57.576 --> 24:58.634
The judge is God!

24:58.710 --> 24:59.540
Louder!

24:59.611 --> 25:01.135
The judge is God!

25:01.280 --> 25:02.338
Why is he God?

25:02.381 --> 25:05.646
Because he decides who wins or loses,
not my opponent!

25:05.717 --> 25:06.706
Who's your opponent?

25:06.819 --> 25:07.911
He doesn't exist!

25:08.020 --> 25:09.248
Why does he not exist?

25:09.321 --> 25:12.950
Because he is merely a dissenting voice
to the truth I speak!

25:13.025 --> 25:13.992
Speak the truth!

25:14.059 --> 25:15.390
Speak the truth!

25:15.460 --> 25:17.018
Yes, sir, I do like to talk.

25:17.095 --> 25:18.960
ls that a virtue or a vice?

25:19.031 --> 25:23.798
Well, I have to admit I've always wanted
to be the quiet, mysterious type,

25:23.869 --> 25:25.962
only I couldn't keep
my mouth shut long enough.

25:26.038 --> 25:28.871
Would you punch yourself
in a street fight, Mr. Burgess?

25:30.209 --> 25:31.301
No, sir.

25:31.376 --> 25:33.071
Then don't punch yourself in a word fight.

25:33.145 --> 25:34.806
You don't have to make fun of yourself.

25:34.880 --> 25:39.817
Use your humor against your opponent.

25:39.885 --> 25:41.079
Mr. Farmer!

25:41.186 --> 25:42.210
Yes, sir.

25:43.622 --> 25:45.613
Happy Mr. Farmer.

25:45.724 --> 25:48.022
Tell us one thing we don't
know about your father.

25:48.093 --> 25:49.321
He was the first Negro Ph.--

25:49.394 --> 25:52.761
One thing we don't know
about your father, Mr. Farmer.

25:54.700 --> 26:00.900
He walked from Florida to Massachusetts
to go to college at Boston University.

26:01.039 --> 26:03.166
He graduated magna cum laude.

26:03.208 --> 26:05.301
Mr. Lowe!

26:09.314 --> 26:10.542
Tell us about your father.

26:10.649 --> 26:13.209
Why don't you tell us something
about your father?

26:13.318 --> 26:15.377
We're trying to get
to know each other, Mr. Lowe.

26:15.487 --> 26:17.478
I was trying to get
to know you, Mr. Tolson.

26:17.589 --> 26:19.352
I'm not the one on the debate team.

26:19.424 --> 26:21.892
Are we not engaged
in a debate right now?

26:23.028 --> 26:25.258
All right.

26:25.330 --> 26:27.389
I'll take the affirmative.

26:29.801 --> 26:34.864
Take the meanest...
most restless nigger,

26:34.940 --> 26:36.908
strip him of his clothes

26:36.975 --> 26:39.170
in front of the remaining male niggers,
female niggers,

26:39.244 --> 26:40.404
and nigger infants.

26:40.479 --> 26:42.310
Tar and feather him.

26:42.381 --> 26:45.475
Tie each leg to a horse
facing an opposite direction,

26:45.584 --> 26:46.710
set him on fire,

26:46.818 --> 26:50.254
and beat both horses
until they tear him apart

26:50.322 --> 26:53.689
in front of the male,
female, and nigger infants.

26:53.759 --> 26:57.695
Bullwhip and beat
the remaining nigger males

26:57.763 --> 26:59.128
within an inch of their life.

26:59.197 --> 27:01.927
Do not kill them, but put
the fear of God in them,

27:01.967 --> 27:04.663
for they can be useful for future breeding.

27:04.703 --> 27:06.398
Anybody know
who Willie Lynch was?

27:06.471 --> 27:07.870
Anybody? Raise your hand.

27:07.940 --> 27:09.134
No one?

27:09.207 --> 27:11.471
He was a vicious slave owner
in the West Indies.

27:11.543 --> 27:13.977
The slave-masters
in the colony of Virginia

27:14.046 --> 27:16.378
were having trouble
controlling their slaves,

27:16.481 --> 27:19.939
so they sent for Mr. Lynch
to teach them his methods.

27:20.052 --> 27:23.544
The word "lynching"
came from his last name.

27:23.655 --> 27:27.853
His methods were very simple,
but they were diabolical.

27:27.926 --> 27:31.987
Keep the slave physically strong
but psychologically weak

27:32.064 --> 27:33.759
and dependent on the slave master.

27:33.832 --> 27:37.233
Keep the body, take the mind.

27:38.770 --> 27:43.867
I...and every other
professor on this campus

27:43.942 --> 27:46.570
are here to help you...

27:48.413 --> 27:51.382
to find, take back,

27:51.450 --> 27:55.819
and keep your righteous mind...

27:55.887 --> 27:59.550
because obviously you have lost it.

28:01.460 --> 28:04.156
That's all you need to know about me,
Mr. Lowe.

28:07.933 --> 28:09.525
Class dismissed.

28:35.260 --> 28:36.318
Hey!

29:54.673 --> 29:55.731
Here you go, honey.

29:55.807 --> 29:56.796
Thank you.

29:58.510 --> 29:59.442
Want to dance?

29:59.511 --> 30:00.739
Yes.

30:01.880 --> 30:03.108
Come on.

30:19.564 --> 30:21.361
You're a good dancer.

30:21.433 --> 30:23.162
Thank you. I--

30:23.235 --> 30:25.760
I practice in my room.

30:25.837 --> 30:27.771
Keep at it.

30:29.107 --> 30:30.540
Excuse me.

30:30.609 --> 30:32.167
Your punch.

30:32.244 --> 30:34.303
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

30:36.948 --> 30:38.973
I guess I better go
get me some punch.

30:39.084 --> 30:40.813
Here, you can have mine if you want.

30:40.919 --> 30:43.012
It's good.

30:43.121 --> 30:44.679
All right?

30:47.826 --> 30:49.919
You know I can take you to a place

30:49.995 --> 30:51.121
that plays real music, right?

30:51.196 --> 30:53.027
I'm not leaving here, Henry.

30:53.098 --> 30:54.030
Just for a spell.

30:54.099 --> 30:55.760
I'll bring you right back.

30:55.834 --> 30:59.031
And what would my chaperone say?

30:59.104 --> 31:01.129
We'll be back before she
ever knows you're gone.

31:01.273 --> 31:03.400
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.

31:06.978 --> 31:08.969
What's the matter? You afraid?

31:19.324 --> 31:20.723
What's the matter?

31:20.792 --> 31:22.123
You afraid?

31:30.735 --> 31:32.168
Excuse me.

32:04.869 --> 32:06.336
Mr. Tolson?

32:29.294 --> 32:31.194
Mr. Tolson!

32:42.540 --> 32:44.565
# Hoo #

32:44.643 --> 32:47.168
# Woo-hoo #

32:51.583 --> 32:56.043
# I remember down
on block number 9 #

32:56.154 --> 32:59.453
# Couldn't hear nothin'
but them old convicts whine #

32:59.524 --> 33:01.958
# Singin' "How long #

33:02.093 --> 33:06.553
# Before I can change my clothes?" #

33:29.788 --> 33:31.915
It's time. Let's go.

33:39.964 --> 33:42.091
...break your back all day.

33:43.735 --> 33:45.965
And it's not right
when they lie to the government

33:46.037 --> 33:48.870
and tell them that sharecroppers
are just wage earners

33:48.940 --> 33:51.670
so they don't have to split
their farmer's subsidies with you.

33:51.743 --> 33:54.268
And that's why
the Southern Tenant Farmers Union

33:54.346 --> 33:55.608
wants you to organize:

33:55.680 --> 33:57.045
to make things right.

33:57.115 --> 33:58.673
How? Strike?

33:58.783 --> 34:00.683
Hell, they'll just bring in the Mexicans.

34:00.852 --> 34:01.819
We'll organize them, too.

34:01.920 --> 34:04.889
Yeah, so they can shoot us all down:
white, colored, and Mexican.

34:04.923 --> 34:06.550
That's exactly what they
want you to believe.

34:06.591 --> 34:08.616
The farm bosses
want you to believe they'll make war.

34:08.693 --> 34:11.719
They won't. They may be fools,
but they're smart businessmen.

34:11.795 --> 34:13.161
And once we're organized,

34:13.231 --> 34:15.027
they'll see even guns can't stop us.

34:15.100 --> 34:16.397
Stopped them in Elaine.

34:16.467 --> 34:17.900
Why don't you talk about that?

34:17.969 --> 34:20.665
About how they killed
a hundred colored sharecroppers

34:20.739 --> 34:21.899
for trying to organize.

34:21.973 --> 34:23.065
That was 1919, friend.

34:23.141 --> 34:26.507
And that was my daddy
they gunned down, friend.

34:26.578 --> 34:27.806
We're sorry about that.

34:27.879 --> 34:29.847
But those men stood alone.

34:29.914 --> 34:31.210
That's my point.

34:31.315 --> 34:33.011
This is 1935.

34:33.118 --> 34:34.915
We've got the National
Labor Relations Board.

34:34.985 --> 34:36.283
We've got the AF of L.

34:36.353 --> 34:37.786
You ain't got shit!

34:37.856 --> 34:39.447
He ain't got shit!

34:50.869 --> 34:52.335
Here they come!
Here they come!

34:52.404 --> 34:55.134
Get the lights! Everybody get down!

34:55.206 --> 34:56.935
Get down. Shh!

35:02.247 --> 35:03.612
Shh!

35:41.719 --> 35:42.743
Come on!

35:47.859 --> 35:50.509
Let's get out of here!

35:50.544 --> 35:53.159
This way! This way! This way!

35:53.231 --> 35:54.289
Come on!

36:11.483 --> 36:13.144
Come on. Come on!

36:26.431 --> 36:27.728
Come on!

36:27.799 --> 36:29.767
All right. All right.

36:32.103 --> 36:35.504
What are you doing out here? Huh?

36:35.573 --> 36:37.632
I saw you-- I was
walking by your house,

36:37.709 --> 36:39.040
and I saw you dressed funny.

36:39.110 --> 36:40.236
I'm dressed like them, son.

36:40.311 --> 36:43.405
You think they'd listen to me
if I was wearing a tuxedo? Huh?

36:43.515 --> 36:44.413
No, sir.

36:44.516 --> 36:45.505
Listen to me.

36:45.617 --> 36:46.743
You listening?

36:46.851 --> 36:49.217
You cannot tell anybody
what you saw tonight.

36:49.287 --> 36:50.254
You understand?

36:50.321 --> 36:51.879
Not even my wife
knows about this.

36:51.990 --> 36:53.457
I won't tell anybody, I promise.

36:53.558 --> 36:55.253
I promise on a stack of Bibles--

36:55.326 --> 36:56.258
Jesus.

36:56.327 --> 36:57.487
... I won't tell anybody.

37:01.699 --> 37:02.723
Come on.

37:39.637 --> 37:40.763
Junior?

37:42.574 --> 37:44.667
Are you just going to stand there?

37:45.843 --> 37:47.174
No, sir.

37:57.088 --> 37:58.419
Sorry I'm late.

37:58.489 --> 38:01.253
You're sorry?

38:01.392 --> 38:04.020
It's 1:00 in the morning.

38:04.062 --> 38:05.757
I've been looking everywhere for you.

38:05.797 --> 38:08.925
I went to Mr. Tolson's
house after the dance.

38:10.868 --> 38:13.632
I thought you might have done that.

38:13.705 --> 38:16.196
That's why I went over there.

38:16.274 --> 38:18.674
And I talked to Ruth.

38:18.743 --> 38:22.201
She said Tolson was gone
and that you weren't there.

38:22.280 --> 38:25.511
So I'm going to give you another chance.

38:26.884 --> 38:28.545
Where were you?

38:28.653 --> 38:30.621
I can't tell you, sir.

38:30.722 --> 38:31.950
Good Lord, boy.

38:32.023 --> 38:34.116
We've been worried to death about you.

38:34.192 --> 38:35.159
Junior--

38:36.794 --> 38:38.762
where were you?

38:40.298 --> 38:42.095
I can't tell you, sir.

38:42.166 --> 38:43.098
Why not?

38:43.167 --> 38:44.759
I don't know.

38:44.836 --> 38:45.996
"I don't know."

38:47.605 --> 38:51.097
"I don't know" is not
an acceptable answer, Junior.

38:51.175 --> 38:52.608
Junior.

38:52.677 --> 38:54.736
Silence is not an option, either.

38:56.114 --> 38:58.048
Son, you been drinking?

38:58.149 --> 38:59.275
Honey--

38:59.384 --> 39:01.477
Because you must've been drinking
coming up in my house

39:01.653 --> 39:05.145
talking about you don't want to tell me
where you been at 1:30 in the morning?

39:05.189 --> 39:06.451
Baby, tell me, what's the matter?

39:06.524 --> 39:07.650
Mom, nothing's the matter.

39:07.725 --> 39:08.749
Something's the matter!

39:08.826 --> 39:10.851
Something is wrong!

39:10.928 --> 39:12.190
Were you with that girl?

39:12.263 --> 39:13.924
- You were with that girl.
- No.

39:13.998 --> 39:15.863
Because you're 14 years old, Junior.

39:15.933 --> 39:17.924
You've got plenty of time for girls later.

39:18.002 --> 39:19.196
I wasn't with Samantha.

39:19.270 --> 39:20.362
Junior.

39:22.306 --> 39:24.001
Then where were you?

39:27.145 --> 39:29.170
Where were you, honey?

39:30.948 --> 39:32.142
You don't want to talk?

39:32.250 --> 39:34.582
Fine.

39:34.652 --> 39:36.313
But you're not leaving this house.

39:36.421 --> 39:37.854
What do you mean?

39:37.922 --> 39:38.889
Just what I said.

39:38.990 --> 39:41.686
You're not leaving this house
until you tell me the truth!

39:41.759 --> 39:42.987
What about school?

39:43.061 --> 39:44.926
Don't go questioning
what I just said, boy!

39:44.996 --> 39:45.928
Mom, what about school?

39:45.997 --> 39:46.929
And don't raise your voice!

39:46.998 --> 39:47.987
I'm not raising my voice!

39:48.066 --> 39:49.397
You raising your voice in the house?

39:49.467 --> 39:50.399
Apologize to your father.

39:50.468 --> 39:51.992
I'm not raising my voice!

39:52.070 --> 39:53.401
You get a job, pay your own way?

39:53.471 --> 39:54.438
You're a man now?

39:54.505 --> 39:55.563
I'm not raising my voice!

39:55.640 --> 39:56.698
Just apologize!

39:56.774 --> 39:57.741
I didn't say anything!

39:57.809 --> 39:59.174
Why should I apologize?

39:59.243 --> 40:01.541
Like you apologized to that pig farmer?

40:01.679 --> 40:03.408
What did you say, boy?

40:10.288 --> 40:11.949
You go to your room.

40:14.992 --> 40:16.755
Okay, Junior--

40:27.805 --> 40:30.273
I'm not going to be weak on this, Pearl.

40:31.476 --> 40:32.807
I know.

40:34.278 --> 40:37.941
I can't allow my son to be corrupted.

40:38.049 --> 40:39.482
You're right.

40:40.952 --> 40:43.420
Let's just go to bed.

40:43.488 --> 40:45.319
I'll take him to school in the morning.

40:45.389 --> 40:46.856
All right?

40:48.025 --> 40:49.253
All right.

41:02.039 --> 41:03.904
I'm going to be honest with you, boys.

41:03.941 --> 41:05.306
I'm not well.

41:05.343 --> 41:07.937
I'm not well at all this morning.

41:08.012 --> 41:09.479
I'm sure sorry to hear that, sir.

41:09.547 --> 41:10.536
You look well to me.

41:10.615 --> 41:11.741
Don't he look well, Sam?

41:11.849 --> 41:13.817
Yes, sir. He looks real good.

41:13.885 --> 41:18.322
Now, we got some white fellas
from up north come into our town.

41:18.389 --> 41:21.358
They're stirring up trouble
between our coloreds and our whites.

41:21.425 --> 41:23.290
They say that we need to make a union:

41:23.361 --> 41:25.886
the sharecroppers
and the workers all together,

41:25.963 --> 41:27.157
colored and white.

41:27.231 --> 41:29.062
They need to make a union?

41:29.133 --> 41:31.067
How do you boys feel about that?

41:31.135 --> 41:32.397
I don't know, sir.

41:32.470 --> 41:34.461
I really ain't thought much about that.

41:34.539 --> 41:36.507
Well, it's a bad idea.

41:36.574 --> 41:39.065
It's a bad idea, take my word for it.

41:39.143 --> 41:41.043
Yes, sir.

41:41.112 --> 41:43.672
And they say that there was
some kind of secret meeting

41:43.748 --> 41:45.113
last night down near the lake.

41:45.216 --> 41:46.740
Now, do you boys know about that?

41:46.851 --> 41:48.250
No, sir.

41:48.319 --> 41:50.446
You don't know about that?

41:51.522 --> 41:53.183
- Samuel?
- No, sir.

41:53.257 --> 41:54.588
- You didn't hear about that?
- No, sir.

41:54.659 --> 41:55.956
- You swear to me?
- Yes, sir.

41:56.027 --> 41:57.551
Yes, sir, I swear.

42:00.398 --> 42:02.161
All right, then.

42:04.669 --> 42:06.159
See you later.

42:06.370 --> 42:08.998
Our first debate

42:09.040 --> 42:14.000
is one week from today.

42:14.078 --> 42:15.943
- One week?
- That's right.

42:16.013 --> 42:17.674
I thought Prairie View was first.

42:17.782 --> 42:20.615
Prairie View is tough,
so I thought we needed a warm-up.

42:20.685 --> 42:23.176
With the best Negro college in the state?

42:23.287 --> 42:25.016
That's right, Mr. Burgess.

42:25.089 --> 42:26.181
Does that frighten you?

42:26.290 --> 42:27.814
Yes, sir.

42:27.892 --> 42:30.986
One week's not enough time
to write our arguments.

42:31.062 --> 42:33.121
You do the research.
I'll write the arguments.

42:33.197 --> 42:35.062
Wait. You--

42:35.132 --> 42:36.565
You write the arguments?

42:36.634 --> 42:37.623
And you deliver them, Mr. Lowe.

42:37.702 --> 42:39.431
What the hell do I look like, a mailman?

42:39.503 --> 42:42.472
Hell is where you're headed
if you question me again.

42:42.540 --> 42:45.168
In theory, you look like a student.

42:45.243 --> 42:47.541
So what you're saying
is I'm not capable.

42:47.612 --> 42:48.772
It's not a matter of competence.

42:48.846 --> 42:49.904
It's a matter of experience.

42:49.981 --> 42:51.141
How do I know you write--

42:51.249 --> 42:52.944
I write the arguments!

42:53.050 --> 42:54.312
That's the way it's been!

42:54.418 --> 42:56.784
That's the way it's going to be!

42:56.854 --> 42:59.550
Any more questions?

43:01.192 --> 43:02.750
One week.

43:05.229 --> 43:06.355
I bring to you

43:06.430 --> 43:08.625
our first affirmative debater:

43:08.699 --> 43:12.863
from Paul Quinn College,
Otheree Hubbard.

43:20.678 --> 43:25.081
Resolved: unemployment
relief should be ended

43:25.182 --> 43:27.650
when the Depression ends.

43:27.752 --> 43:29.549
If the Depression ends.

43:29.620 --> 43:33.249
I traveled back through history to 1536,

43:33.324 --> 43:35.815
when the first Poor Laws
of England were mandated.

43:35.893 --> 43:39.226
In those days, the dole--
or welfare, as we call it--

43:39.297 --> 43:42.027
was funded by voluntary contributions.

43:42.099 --> 43:44.567
But, as time passed,

43:44.635 --> 43:46.796
the English devised the Allowance System,

43:46.871 --> 43:48.839
the first unemployment relief,

43:48.906 --> 43:52.239
only now it was paid
with involuntary contributions,

43:52.310 --> 43:54.210
more commonly known as taxes.

43:55.546 --> 43:57.878
The Allowance System was a disaster.

43:57.982 --> 44:00.849
The only real unemployment relief
is to give a man a job.

44:00.985 --> 44:03.920
But to do that, you have
to give the economy life,

44:03.955 --> 44:07.186
not tax it to death.

44:11.929 --> 44:14.124
When capitalism was young,

44:14.198 --> 44:16.291
the old puritanical concept of duty

44:16.367 --> 44:19.734
was, "He who does not work
shall not eat."

44:19.804 --> 44:21.669
That made sense
when there was more work

44:21.739 --> 44:23.434
than men willing to do it.

44:23.507 --> 44:25.065
But those days are gone.

44:25.142 --> 44:27.007
Now there are millions
who want to work,

44:27.078 --> 44:28.943
but find themselves
standing in breadlines.

44:29.013 --> 44:31.675
Now, should they not eat
because there are no jobs?

44:31.782 --> 44:33.943
People, today we need
a new concept of duty:

44:34.051 --> 44:37.020
the right of the individual
to demand from society

44:37.088 --> 44:40.023
just as much as he gives to society.

44:42.793 --> 44:45.660
We clutch at anything that
even looks like a solution.

44:45.730 --> 44:49.029
$60 million a month for public relief?

44:49.100 --> 44:52.900
Pay it out if it'll sweep
the hoboes off the streets.

44:52.970 --> 44:57.430
One seventh of the population
of the United States on welfare.

44:57.508 --> 44:59.840
Fine, as long as it ends our misery.

44:59.910 --> 45:04.313
A nation as desperate as this
is a danger to itself.

45:04.382 --> 45:06.373
That's right.

45:08.719 --> 45:10.186
Once,

45:10.287 --> 45:14.223
a Roman general brought peace
to a rebellious province...

45:14.325 --> 45:17.123
by killing all its citizens.

45:17.194 --> 45:18.855
Even his fellow Romans
were shocked.

45:18.929 --> 45:20.157
One of them wrote,

45:20.231 --> 45:22.529
<i>"Solitudinem faciunt,
pacem appellant, "</i>

45:22.600 --> 45:26.832
which means "They create desolation
and call it peace."

45:27.938 --> 45:29.735
Now, for all their facts and figures,

45:29.807 --> 45:33.641
the Paul Quinn debaters would also
create desolation and call it peace.

45:33.711 --> 45:37.807
They would allow the unemployed to die
so the economy can live.

45:55.666 --> 45:57.293
A brilliant young woman I know

45:57.368 --> 46:01.304
was asked once to support her argument
in favor of social welfare.

46:01.439 --> 46:04.738
She named the most powerful source
imaginable:

46:04.775 --> 46:09.007
the look in a mother's face
when she cannot feed her children.

46:12.950 --> 46:15.350
Can you look that hungry
child in the eyes?

46:15.419 --> 46:16.784
See the blood on his feet

46:16.854 --> 46:18.822
from walking barefoot
in the cotton fields?

46:18.923 --> 46:21.949
Or do you ask his baby sister
with her belly swollen from hunger

46:22.026 --> 46:23.891
if she cares about
her daddy's work ethic?

46:34.238 --> 46:35.227
He's good.

46:36.941 --> 46:40.274

46:55.893 --> 46:58.384
The only thing that matters
is that big fish eat little fish,

46:58.462 --> 47:00.589
and the color of the fish
does not count!

47:00.731 --> 47:02.255
<i>#...step it up and go #</i>

47:03.467 --> 47:06.334
If the state of Mississippi
would have turned their heads

47:06.403 --> 47:08.769
each and every time
a Negro was lynched,

47:08.839 --> 47:10.466
shouldn't the federal government intervene?

47:11.609 --> 47:14.339
<i># Yeah, and go #</i>

That's right, Captain.

48:33.924 --> 48:35.516
I think I've got the ringleader.

48:37.394 --> 48:40.955
Uh, all right,
if that's what you want.

48:41.966 --> 48:43.831
Yeah. Okey-dokey, then.

48:43.901 --> 48:45.300
Bye-bye.

48:47.204 --> 48:48.364
Shit.

48:48.439 --> 48:49.906
Who was that?

48:49.974 --> 48:51.441
Captain Wainwright.

48:51.508 --> 48:53.271
Texas Rangers?

48:53.344 --> 48:54.538
Mm-hmm.

48:56.013 --> 48:59.915
He wants me to, uh, hold off
on picking this fella up

48:59.984 --> 49:02.077
until him and his boys get up here.

49:02.253 --> 49:04.483
Shit. Wants to get
his picture in the paper.

49:04.521 --> 49:05.545
Yeah.

49:05.623 --> 49:08.717
We do all the work,
they get all the glory.

49:08.792 --> 49:10.316
Yep.

49:11.862 --> 49:16.533
I guess that's just the way the world is.

49:16.568 --> 49:18.398
Isn't that right, Samuel?

49:24.341 --> 49:26.832
I have an announcement
to make. Excuse me.

49:28.012 --> 49:30.480
Recently, I-- uh, we--

49:30.581 --> 49:32.048
Mm-hmm.

49:32.116 --> 49:35.552
...sent some letters
to some major universities.

49:35.619 --> 49:37.644
Told them all about us, our team,

49:37.755 --> 49:39.188
what we've been doing,

49:39.256 --> 49:43.215
and, uh, yesterday
we got a response.

49:44.428 --> 49:46.623
From Oklahoma City University.

49:46.697 --> 49:48.130
Aren't they--?

49:48.198 --> 49:50.063
Anglo-Saxon? Yes. Yes.

49:50.134 --> 49:51.965
We'll be the first Negro college in America--

49:52.036 --> 49:54.231
well, one of the first Negro
colleges in America--

49:54.305 --> 49:55.772
to ever debate a white college.

49:55.839 --> 49:56.931
All right!

49:57.007 --> 49:58.634
University of Oklahoma!

49:58.709 --> 50:02.076
Not University of Oklahoma.
Oklahoma City University.

50:02.212 --> 50:04.942
The debate will take place
at an off-campus site.

50:04.982 --> 50:06.643
Wait. An off-campus site? Why?

50:06.750 --> 50:08.775
Because sometimes, Mr. Lowe,

50:08.886 --> 50:11.150
you have to take things
one step at a time.

50:11.221 --> 50:13.018
So what you're saying is
the crackers in Oklahoma

50:13.090 --> 50:14.489
ain't gonna let us on their campus.

50:14.558 --> 50:17.618
No, what I'm saying is you have to take
things one step at a time.

50:17.695 --> 50:19.162
This is a great opportunity.

50:19.229 --> 50:20.161
Thank you very much.

50:20.230 --> 50:23.722
Master is going to give us
a crumb off his plate, huh?

50:26.904 --> 50:28.769
What? Wha--

50:28.839 --> 50:31.535
I think Lowe here is afraid.

50:31.608 --> 50:34.076
What am I afraid of, James?

50:34.144 --> 50:36.112
I think you're afraid
to debate white people.

50:36.180 --> 50:37.545
- Anglo-Saxons.
- Anglo-Saxons.

50:37.648 --> 50:38.376
Thank you very much.

50:38.482 --> 50:40.006
Mr. Tolson, let me debate.

50:40.117 --> 50:44.747
I mean, I'll debate
Anglo-Saxons anywhere:

50:44.855 --> 50:46.652
in a dark alley, with no light,

50:46.724 --> 50:48.988
with a candle lit and people
chasing you down with guns.

50:49.059 --> 50:51.357
Hell, I'll debate Anglo-Saxons anywhere.

50:51.428 --> 50:52.690
I ain't afraid.

50:52.763 --> 50:54.321
I am.

50:57.901 --> 51:00.131
Mr. Tolson, when I came here today,

51:00.204 --> 51:03.367
I saw the sheriff outside watching your house.

51:03.407 --> 51:05.500
What's going on?

51:09.847 --> 51:11.838
Maybe you should ask the sheriff.

51:11.949 --> 51:14.679
I've been hearing a lot of rumors
about what you're doing.

51:14.785 --> 51:16.685
My dad just called the Dean last week

51:16.754 --> 51:18.312
and asked, "What is
a communist doing

51:18.422 --> 51:19.787
teaching at a good Methodist college?"

51:19.857 --> 51:21.950
My politics are my business,
Mr. Burgess,

51:22.025 --> 51:24.755
and I promise you that they
will not endanger the team.

51:24.828 --> 51:26.455
But, sir, it is being endangered.

51:26.530 --> 51:28.862
I came to Wiley College
to be educated, not investigated.

51:28.932 --> 51:30.058
I understand that.

51:30.134 --> 51:32.034
I don't want to be dragged into anything.

51:32.102 --> 51:34.229
- You're not--
- If my parents find--

51:34.304 --> 51:36.101
I'm sorry.

51:37.241 --> 51:39.675
Mr. Tolson, please.

51:39.743 --> 51:41.836
Just tell me you're not
a communist. Otherwise--

51:41.912 --> 51:43.607
Otherwise what?

51:46.950 --> 51:48.508
Otherwise what?

51:48.619 --> 51:50.450
My father says I have to quit.

51:50.521 --> 51:51.852
Nobody wants that.

51:51.922 --> 51:53.253
Then tell me.

51:54.925 --> 52:00.625
As I said, my politics are my business.

52:02.366 --> 52:04.197
I guess I have to resign.

52:14.044 --> 52:18.845
Mrs. Tolson, thank you
for a wonderful dinner.

52:18.949 --> 52:21.144
You're welcome, Ham.

52:23.086 --> 52:24.678
Good luck in Oklahoma, y'all.

52:27.658 --> 52:29.353
I know you'll win.

52:44.274 --> 52:46.003
All right. Well,

52:46.076 --> 52:48.943
if anybody else wants to quit, I'll understand.

53:34.925 --> 53:36.051
Resolved:

53:36.126 --> 53:39.653
Negroes should be--

53:39.730 --> 53:42.324
should be admitted--

53:42.399 --> 53:43.866
I can't hear you!

53:43.934 --> 53:45.595
Speak up!

53:45.669 --> 53:47.762
Resolved--

53:49.139 --> 53:56.443
Negroes should be admitted
to state universities.

53:56.513 --> 53:59.710
My partner and I will prove

53:59.816 --> 54:04.185
that blocking a Negro's admission
to a state university

54:04.254 --> 54:08.953
is not only wrong, it is absurd.

54:09.026 --> 54:15.693
The Negro people are not just a color
in the American fabric.

54:15.766 --> 54:18.735
They are the thread
that holds it all together.

54:18.802 --> 54:22.568
Consider the legal
and historical record.

54:22.639 --> 54:24.607
May 13, 1865:

54:24.675 --> 54:26.302
Sergeant Crocker, a Negro,

54:26.376 --> 54:30.142
is the last soldier to die in the Civil War.

and Needham Roberts.

that the "N" in Negro would hereafter
be capitalized.

54:45.729 --> 54:49.756
To force upon the South
what they are not ready for

54:49.833 --> 54:52.165
would result in nothing
but more racial hatred.

54:52.235 --> 54:53.224
What?

54:53.303 --> 54:55.328
Dr. W.E.B. DuBois--

54:55.405 --> 54:58.602
he's perhaps the most eminent
Negro scholar in America.

54:58.675 --> 55:00.540
He comments...

55:00.677 --> 55:04.670
"It's a silly waste
of money, time, and temper

55:04.715 --> 55:06.342
"to try and compel a powerful majority

55:06.416 --> 55:10.375
to do what they are
determined not to do."

55:10.487 --> 55:13.854
My opponent so conveniently chose
to ignore the fact

55:13.924 --> 55:17.587
that W.E.B. DuBois is the first Negro

55:17.661 --> 55:21.324
to receive a Ph.D
from a white college called Harvard.

55:21.398 --> 55:22.956
Dr. DuBois, he adds,

55:23.033 --> 55:27.402
"It is impossible--
impossible for a Negro

55:27.471 --> 55:30.304
to receive a proper education
at a white college."

55:30.374 --> 55:33.400
The most eminent
Negro scholar in America

55:33.477 --> 55:35.809
is the product of
an Ivy League education.

55:35.879 --> 55:39.144
You see, DuBois knows all too well
the white man's resistance to change.

55:39.249 --> 55:43.049
But that's no reason to keep
a black man out of any college.

55:43.120 --> 55:46.317
If someone didn't force upon the South
something it wasn't ready for,

55:46.390 --> 55:47.584
I'd still be in chains,

55:47.658 --> 55:50.092
and Miss Booke here would be
running from her old Master!

55:51.928 --> 55:54.556
I do admit it.

55:54.631 --> 55:56.531
It is true.

55:56.600 --> 56:00.730
Far too many whites are afflicted
with the disease of racial hatred.

56:00.871 --> 56:02.998
And because of racism,

56:03.073 --> 56:05.633
it would be impossible
for a Negro to be happy

56:05.676 --> 56:07.041
at a southern white college today.

56:07.077 --> 56:08.169
That's true.

56:08.245 --> 56:09.610
And if someone is unhappy,

56:09.680 --> 56:13.776
it is impossible to see how they could
receive a proper education.

56:13.884 --> 56:15.351
That's right.

56:15.419 --> 56:16.977
Yes, a time will come

56:17.087 --> 56:19.954
when Negroes and whites
will walk on the same campus

56:20.023 --> 56:22.685
and we will share
the same classrooms.

56:24.227 --> 56:27.458
But sadly, that day is not today.

56:27.531 --> 56:31.023
As long as schools
are segregated,

56:31.101 --> 56:36.903
Negroes will receive an education
that is both separate and unequal.

56:36.973 --> 56:38.941
By Oklahoma's own reckoning,

56:39.009 --> 56:42.740
the state is currently
spending five times more

56:42.813 --> 56:44.781
for the education of a white child

56:44.881 --> 56:47.213
than it is spending
to educate a colored child.

56:47.317 --> 56:50.912
That means better textbooks
for that child than for that child.

56:51.021 --> 56:52.579
Oh, I say that's a shame,

56:52.689 --> 56:55.783
but my opponent says
today is not the day

56:55.859 --> 56:59.659
for whites and coloreds
to go to the same college,

56:59.730 --> 57:01.994
to share the same campus,

57:02.132 --> 57:04.123
to walk in the same classroom.

57:04.167 --> 57:07.796
Well, would you kindly tell me
when is that day gonna come?

57:07.838 --> 57:10.102
ls it gonna come tomorrow?
ls it gonna come next week?

57:10.173 --> 57:11.470
In a hundred years?

57:11.541 --> 57:12.599
Never?

57:12.676 --> 57:14.667
No, the time for justice,

57:14.745 --> 57:17.714
the time for freedom,
and the time for equality

57:17.781 --> 57:21.547
is always, is always, right now!

57:38.034 --> 57:39.023
Thank you.

57:51.148 --> 57:52.581
What is this?

57:52.682 --> 57:54.149
I told you it was holy wine.

57:54.251 --> 57:55.411
Put hair on your chest.

57:55.519 --> 57:56.952
If you say so.

57:57.020 --> 57:57.952
Good, ain't it?

57:58.021 --> 57:59.113
Uh-huh.

57:59.222 --> 58:01.349
You know where the bathroom
is if you need it.

58:01.491 --> 58:02.719
Yeah.

58:08.031 --> 58:10.397
And my weapons were words.

58:10.467 --> 58:12.799
I didn't need a gun. I didn't need a knife.

58:12.869 --> 58:13.858
You see--

58:15.338 --> 58:17.465
Meet me outside in five minutes.

58:17.541 --> 58:19.600
And then what?

58:31.388 --> 58:32.753
Yes, I did, honey,

58:32.823 --> 58:35.189
and nobody knows that
better than you know.

58:35.258 --> 58:36.384
Oh, I'm fine.

58:36.459 --> 58:37.892
How are you doing, Pearl?

58:37.961 --> 58:38.985
Pearl!

58:39.062 --> 58:40.927
Yes, I do. Where's your husband?

58:40.997 --> 58:42.828
- He's in the study.
- Okay.

58:56.413 --> 58:58.313
Dr. Farmer.

58:58.415 --> 58:59.712
Congratulations, Melvin.

58:59.816 --> 59:00.714
Thank you.

59:00.851 --> 59:02.182
You've put us on the map.

59:02.252 --> 59:03.879
Well, your son is doing a great job.

59:03.920 --> 59:05.319
His research is impeccable.

59:05.388 --> 59:08.016
That's good to hear.
That's good to hear.

59:08.091 --> 59:10.958
Listen, there are people around town

59:11.027 --> 59:13.928
who aren't very happy
with your off-campus activities.

59:15.398 --> 59:17.161
They're calling you a radical.

59:17.234 --> 59:19.293
In fact, I wouldn't be a bit surprised

59:19.369 --> 59:21.530
to find out one morning
when I woke up

59:21.605 --> 59:23.470
that you were strung up to a tree.

59:23.540 --> 59:24.905
They'd have to catch me first.

59:24.975 --> 59:26.499
This is serious, Melvin.

59:26.576 --> 59:28.237
Very serious.

59:28.311 --> 59:30.871
A hungry Negro steals
a chicken, he goes to jail.

59:30.947 --> 59:33.780
A rich businessman steals
bonds, he goes to Congress.

59:33.884 --> 59:35.078
I think that's wrong.

59:35.185 --> 59:38.382
Now, if that makes me a radical,
a socialist, a communist, so be it.

59:38.455 --> 59:39.513
Amen-- Amen on that.

59:39.623 --> 59:41.147
- Jesus was a radical.
- Careful.

59:41.258 --> 59:43.123
Yes, He was. Jesus was a radical.

59:43.193 --> 59:44.717
Mental institutions are filled with people

59:44.794 --> 59:46.386
who have confused themselves
with Jesus Christ.

59:46.463 --> 59:47.521
I'm not confused.

59:47.597 --> 59:49.064
You're convinced you're Jesus Christ now?

59:49.132 --> 59:50.565
- No.
- You're convinced you're Jesus Christ?

59:50.634 --> 59:51.965
You know what words do.

59:52.035 --> 59:53.195
- Okay.
- Come on now.

59:53.270 --> 59:54.498
Amen.

59:54.571 --> 59:55.868
Don't want to confuse
yourself with Jesus Christ.

59:55.939 --> 59:57.770
I'm not confused. I'm convinced.

59:57.841 --> 01:00:00.469
I'm not, uh, I'm not judging you.

01:00:01.678 --> 01:00:06.316
I'm just concerned
about your methods.

01:00:06.351 --> 01:00:08.284
What methods?

01:00:08.351 --> 01:00:11.411
James was there that night, wasn't he?

01:00:11.521 --> 01:00:14.149
He was not with me.

01:00:14.224 --> 01:00:15.452
ls he involved in this?

01:00:15.525 --> 01:00:16.787
Of course not, James.

01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:19.624
I've done everything in my power
to keep him out of this.

01:00:19.696 --> 01:00:20.754
- To keep him out?
- Yes.

01:00:20.830 --> 01:00:22.593
Are you telling me
he wants to be involved?

01:00:22.666 --> 01:00:24.293
Maybe this is something
you should discuss with him.

01:00:24.367 --> 01:00:25.766
I'm discussing it with you right now,

01:00:25.835 --> 01:00:27.894
and I don't feel like I'm getting
a straight answer.

01:00:27.971 --> 01:00:29.131
You're getting a straight answer.

01:00:29.205 --> 01:00:31.673
I think that you were
there with him that night.

01:00:31.741 --> 01:00:32.673
He was not with me.

01:00:32.742 --> 01:00:33.834
He's a 14-year-old boy.

01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:34.899
I understand that.

01:00:34.978 --> 01:00:37.538
I'll do whatever I have to do
to protect him.

01:00:37.614 --> 01:00:38.774
ls anybody thirsty?

01:00:38.882 --> 01:00:40.372
Here you are.

01:00:40.483 --> 01:00:42.417
Thank you. Thank you, Ruth.

01:00:42.485 --> 01:00:43.884
- You're welcome.
- Mm-hmm.

01:00:43.954 --> 01:00:45.421
Okay.

01:00:45.522 --> 01:00:47.888
Ruth, this is a fine party.

01:00:47.958 --> 01:00:49.357
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

01:00:49.426 --> 01:00:51.394
I think it's time
for some sweet potato pie.

01:00:51.461 --> 01:00:52.393
Please.

01:00:52.462 --> 01:00:53.793
I'll help you with that.

01:01:00.837 --> 01:01:03.465
Not the time to talk about it.

01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:04.302
Congratulations.

01:01:04.341 --> 01:01:05.706
Thank you.

01:01:29.332 --> 01:01:31.994
It's so beautiful out here.

01:01:32.068 --> 01:01:33.831
Mm-hmm.

01:01:33.903 --> 01:01:35.063
Yeah.

01:01:35.138 --> 01:01:38.869
I was born near here,
a little further up the lake near Jefferson.

01:01:38.942 --> 01:01:42.434
I've been coming here
since I was a little boy.

01:01:42.512 --> 01:01:45.037
Your parents still live around here?

01:01:45.115 --> 01:01:48.243
No, no. They're, uh, they're gone.

01:01:48.351 --> 01:01:50.342
My grandparents raised me.

01:01:50.453 --> 01:01:52.421
And my Pah-Pah, he, uh,

01:01:52.522 --> 01:01:54.820
spent his life doing
the levees around here--

01:01:54.891 --> 01:01:56.153
for free, of course.

01:01:56.226 --> 01:01:58.456
- Mm. He was a slave?
- Mm-hmm.

01:01:58.528 --> 01:02:00.962
My grandma was always
telling me to be good

01:02:01.097 --> 01:02:04.533
or else the Confederates would rise up
out of Marshall Cemetery and get me.

01:02:07.070 --> 01:02:08.435
Boy.

01:02:12.709 --> 01:02:13.869
What?

01:02:13.943 --> 01:02:17.208
I've just never seen
this side of you before.

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:19.373
What side?

01:02:19.482 --> 01:02:21.916
You seem so calm,

01:02:21.985 --> 01:02:23.418
so peaceful.

01:02:23.486 --> 01:02:26.785
It's what the lake does to me.

01:02:26.856 --> 01:02:29.324
I'm happy when I'm out here,
you know?

01:02:31.261 --> 01:02:32.922
It's funny.

01:02:46.709 --> 01:02:51.408
Part of me wants to just stay out here
by the lake, you know?

01:02:51.481 --> 01:02:56.578
Read books all day and hunt
and fish when I get hungry.

01:02:56.686 --> 01:02:58.984
And the other part
wants to go everywhere,

01:02:59.055 --> 01:03:00.317
you know, see everything.

01:03:00.457 --> 01:03:07.192
I want to go to New Orleans and New York
and Chicago and even San Francisco.

01:03:08.164 --> 01:03:10.689
I just want to go...

01:03:10.767 --> 01:03:14.897
walking down the road and...

01:03:14.971 --> 01:03:16.336
just disappear.

01:03:19.876 --> 01:03:22.845
Well, maybe you could
take me with you.

01:05:09.419 --> 01:05:10.545
- Lord.
- What?

01:05:10.653 --> 01:05:12.211
It's the school band,
and they're outside.

01:05:12.322 --> 01:05:13.983
What? Jesus!

01:05:14.057 --> 01:05:15.991
I thought you said nobody
ever comes around here.

01:05:16.059 --> 01:05:17.321
Nobody ever does
come here, Samantha.

01:05:17.393 --> 01:05:18.792
Hold on! Hold on!

01:05:18.861 --> 01:05:20.488
Henry, come on!

01:05:21.664 --> 01:05:23.029
Henry.

01:05:23.099 --> 01:05:24.259
Get dressed.

01:05:24.334 --> 01:05:25.892
What's going on?

01:05:25.969 --> 01:05:28.164
We're gonna go get
Mr. Tolson and Samantha,

01:05:28.238 --> 01:05:30.900
head back to the campus,
and have a pep rally.

01:05:30.974 --> 01:05:32.305
Come on, get dressed.

01:05:32.375 --> 01:05:33.967
You know what?
You go get Tolson,

01:05:34.043 --> 01:05:36.136
and I'll meet up with y'all later on campus.

01:05:36.212 --> 01:05:37.406
Come on, Lowe.

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:39.744
You know it's going to be fun.

01:05:51.427 --> 01:05:53.861
I guess I'll tell them
you're going to join us later?

01:06:06.876 --> 01:06:08.605
He's going to join us later.

01:06:08.678 --> 01:06:11.408
He just has to clean
his house, that's all.

01:06:29.766 --> 01:06:33.600
Great news. Great news.
Great news!

01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:36.537
My phone has been ringing off the hook.

01:06:36.606 --> 01:06:38.801
University of Michigan
wants to debate us.

01:06:38.875 --> 01:06:40.900
So does SMU. So does Georgia.

01:06:40.977 --> 01:06:42.069
Where's Mr. Lowe?

01:06:42.145 --> 01:06:44.113
When do I get to debate?

01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:45.545
Sooner than you think, James.

01:06:45.648 --> 01:06:46.706
Sooner than you think.

01:06:46.816 --> 01:06:47.942
When?

01:06:48.051 --> 01:06:49.382
When you're ready.

01:06:49.452 --> 01:06:50.612
I'm ready now.

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:53.883
Mr. Tolson, I do not mind if James--

01:06:55.858 --> 01:06:56.984
What's wrong?

01:06:57.060 --> 01:06:59.494
Maybe I'm tired of this.

01:06:59.562 --> 01:07:00.893
Of what?

01:07:01.030 --> 01:07:02.964
Of watching other people debate.

01:07:03.032 --> 01:07:05.227
When am I going to get
a chance to prove myself?

01:07:05.268 --> 01:07:07.236
You're our best researcher, James.

01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:08.862
We could not do this without you.

01:07:08.938 --> 01:07:11.236
You do plenty without me.

01:07:16.079 --> 01:07:17.410
Excuse me.

01:07:20.683 --> 01:07:21.843
- James!
- What?

01:07:21.951 --> 01:07:24.784
James, you wait!

01:07:24.854 --> 01:07:27.687
That was so mean
what you said in there.

01:07:29.425 --> 01:07:31.518
All right, uh, look,

01:07:31.594 --> 01:07:33.289
I don't want to lose your friendship.

01:07:33.363 --> 01:07:36.423
How can you lose something
that you never had?

01:07:36.499 --> 01:07:38.524
You were never my friend?

01:07:38.601 --> 01:07:41.001
Maybe I don't want
to just be your friend.

01:07:41.070 --> 01:07:43.538
Maybe it hurts me
to be your friend.

01:07:54.984 --> 01:07:56.349
- What's going on?
- What's going on?

01:07:59.489 --> 01:08:00.888
Grab his hands.

01:08:04.694 --> 01:08:06.821
Mr. Tolson!

01:08:11.834 --> 01:08:12.858
Where is he?

01:08:12.935 --> 01:08:14.095
Calm down, Henry.

01:08:14.170 --> 01:08:15.102
Have you seen him?

01:08:15.171 --> 01:08:16.331
No, they won't let us.

01:08:16.406 --> 01:08:17.770
They didn't do nothing to you, did they?

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:19.831
- No, we're fine.
- Deputy,

01:08:19.908 --> 01:08:21.466
I'm Dr. James Farmer
of Wiley College.

01:08:21.544 --> 01:08:23.444
This is William Taylor,
Mr. Tolson's attorney.

01:08:23.513 --> 01:08:24.979
And this is his wife Ruth.

01:08:25.046 --> 01:08:26.071
Hello.

01:08:26.182 --> 01:08:27.706
I'd like to see my client, please.

01:08:27.817 --> 01:08:28.783
William!

01:08:28.850 --> 01:08:30.341
Sheriff Dozier. Dr. James Farmer--

01:08:30.453 --> 01:08:32.250
Hello, William. How you doing today?

01:08:32.321 --> 01:08:33.879
Fine, sir, thank you. And you?

01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:35.582
Oh, not too bad, not too bad.

01:08:35.658 --> 01:08:37.182
Me and William, we go way back.

01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:39.251
I knew William when I was a boy.

01:08:39.328 --> 01:08:42.194
Could I see my client now, Sheriff?

01:08:42.265 --> 01:08:43.459
Your client?

01:08:43.533 --> 01:08:45.933
Well, the fact of the business
is, William,

01:08:46.002 --> 01:08:47.902
your client is kind of busy right now.

01:08:47.970 --> 01:08:49.232
Busy doing what?

01:08:49.305 --> 01:08:51.933
Sheriff. Sheriff.

01:08:52.942 --> 01:08:54.068
We have a situation.

01:08:55.278 --> 01:08:56.711
Get some of your boys out there.

01:08:56.779 --> 01:08:57.803
All right, men.

01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:00.849
Let him go! Let him go!

01:09:01.017 --> 01:09:03.314
Let him go! Let him go!

01:09:03.386 --> 01:09:06.014
Let him go! Let him go!

01:09:06.055 --> 01:09:08.683
Let him go! Let him go!

01:09:08.758 --> 01:09:10.419
Let him go! Let him go!

01:09:10.493 --> 01:09:12.756
Let him go! Let him go!

01:09:12.828 --> 01:09:14.660
Let him go! Let him go!

01:09:14.729 --> 01:09:16.357
Let him go! Let him go!

01:09:16.432 --> 01:09:17.729
They with you?

01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:19.290
That's right.

01:09:19.368 --> 01:09:23.395
See? This is what happens to a town
when you let the unions in.

01:09:23.473 --> 01:09:24.701
Starts trouble.

01:09:24.774 --> 01:09:27.037
People get all riled up about nothing.

01:09:27.109 --> 01:09:30.943
One of them's liable to get hurt,
if you catch my drift.

01:09:31.013 --> 01:09:32.981
Sheriff, since it's clear

01:09:33.082 --> 01:09:36.245
that you have no evidence
to arrest Mr. Tolson,

01:09:36.352 --> 01:09:38.252
I suggest you let him go.

01:09:38.321 --> 01:09:39.582
You suggest it?

01:09:39.654 --> 01:09:40.952
Who the hell are you?

01:09:42.058 --> 01:09:43.957
Couple of months ago,

01:09:44.026 --> 01:09:47.154
there was a raid
on Floyd Tillman's barn.

01:09:47.229 --> 01:09:50.926
It was a peaceful and lawful
gathering of sharecroppers

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.903
who were brutally attacked
by a gang of violent vigilantes.

01:09:55.972 --> 01:09:59.806
Now, witnesses say
that you were there.

01:09:59.876 --> 01:10:03.437
If you led that raid, Sheriff,

01:10:03.579 --> 01:10:06.742
you're the one who broke
the law, not Tolson.

01:10:08.117 --> 01:10:10.210
Are you threatening me, boy?

01:10:10.319 --> 01:10:11.650
No, sir.

01:10:11.721 --> 01:10:13.689
I wouldn't do that.

01:10:13.789 --> 01:10:16.815
But I cannot speak
for those people outside.

01:10:17.894 --> 01:10:21.887
An unjust law is no law at all.

01:10:21.964 --> 01:10:24.159
What does that mean?

01:10:24.233 --> 01:10:26.258
A mass slaughter

01:10:26.335 --> 01:10:29.930
of citizens, both white and colored,

01:10:30.006 --> 01:10:31.735
by Texas Rangers?

01:10:31.807 --> 01:10:35.470
ls that really what you want
as the Sheriff of this county?

01:10:38.047 --> 01:10:40.914
Now, if you let Tolson go home,

01:10:41.017 --> 01:10:42.848
I believe--

01:10:42.919 --> 01:10:48.323
I believe that these folks outside,
they'll go home as well.

01:11:14.450 --> 01:11:16.680
That pig wasn't worth $25.

01:11:16.786 --> 01:11:17.753
What?

01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:19.981
You owe my father some money.

01:12:19.281 --> 01:12:20.748
Have a seat, Mr. Farmer.

01:12:22.351 --> 01:12:24.342
Oh, Lord.

01:12:25.655 --> 01:12:26.849
Um...

01:12:29.425 --> 01:12:31.893
SMU has cancelled.

01:12:31.961 --> 01:12:35.829
University of Georgia sounds
like they will follow suit.

01:12:35.898 --> 01:12:37.297
Why?

01:12:38.801 --> 01:12:41.497
I've been blacklisted.

01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:43.561
They're talking about censuring me.

01:12:43.639 --> 01:12:45.971
Dean Clay and the board
have asked me

01:12:46.042 --> 01:12:49.500
to stop working with
the sharecroppers, or else.

01:12:49.578 --> 01:12:52.138
They say that it is not my fight.

01:12:52.214 --> 01:12:55.706
So...things are bad.

01:12:55.818 --> 01:12:57.786
My academic career's in jeopardy.

01:12:57.887 --> 01:13:00.253
My debate team has nowhere to go.

01:13:02.358 --> 01:13:04.588
Anyone know who Antaeus was?

01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:09.154
Sure. He was a gigantic
wrestler in Greek mythology.

01:13:09.231 --> 01:13:13.565
His mother was, uh, Gaea,
the goddess of Earth,

01:13:13.636 --> 01:13:15.570
and, uh, I mean, he was unbeatable

01:13:15.638 --> 01:13:17.538
because anytime someone
threw him down to the Earth,

01:13:17.606 --> 01:13:18.595
it would make him stronger.

01:13:18.674 --> 01:13:19.868
That's correct.

01:13:19.942 --> 01:13:21.341
It would make him stronger.

01:13:21.410 --> 01:13:25.141
Defeat would make him stronger.

01:13:25.214 --> 01:13:27.307
You are my students.
I am your teacher.

01:13:27.416 --> 01:13:30.112
I think that's a sacred trust.

01:13:30.219 --> 01:13:32.244
So what do I say to you now?

01:13:32.354 --> 01:13:34.345
Quit because the Dean says so?

01:13:34.457 --> 01:13:36.357
Because the sheriff says so?

01:13:36.425 --> 01:13:38.450
Because the Texas Rangers say so?

01:13:38.527 --> 01:13:39.824
No.

01:13:39.895 --> 01:13:41.863
I am diametrically opposed to that.

01:13:41.931 --> 01:13:44.297
My message to you is to never quit.

01:13:44.366 --> 01:13:46.027
We are not quitting.

01:13:46.102 --> 01:13:47.126
Good.

01:13:47.203 --> 01:13:48.727
What do you want us to do?

01:13:48.804 --> 01:13:49.793
Debate Harvard.

01:13:49.872 --> 01:13:51.339
- Harvard?
- Harvard University.

01:13:51.407 --> 01:13:53.671
They're the reigning
national champions.

01:13:53.743 --> 01:13:56.644
If we defeat them, we defeat the best.

01:13:56.712 --> 01:13:58.646
Mr. Tolson, sir, with all due respect,

01:13:58.748 --> 01:14:00.477
um, Harvard ain't going to debate us,

01:14:00.649 --> 01:14:02.116
not little old Wiley College
in Marshall, Texas.

01:14:02.184 --> 01:14:03.617
They know who we are, Henry.

01:14:03.686 --> 01:14:05.847
I've been writing them letters,
sending them articles.

01:14:05.888 --> 01:14:07.753
But how do we get a letter back?

01:14:07.823 --> 01:14:08.790
By continuing to win.

01:14:08.858 --> 01:14:09.984
Dr. Farmer has informed me

01:14:10.059 --> 01:14:13.222
that Howard University is going to be
at Prairie View next week.

01:14:13.295 --> 01:14:14.819
We annihilated Fisk.

01:14:14.897 --> 01:14:17.525
If we eliminate Howard,
we will have beaten

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:19.534
the two best Negro colleges in America,

01:14:19.602 --> 01:14:21.934
and I can guarantee you
that I will see to it

01:14:22.004 --> 01:14:23.528
that Harvard does not ignore that.

01:14:23.606 --> 01:14:24.971
All right?

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:26.029
Yeah.

01:14:26.108 --> 01:14:27.871
<i># You guys, scoodle um skoo #</i>

01:14:28.144 --> 01:14:30.339
<i># Oh, baby, let's scoodle um skoo #</i>

01:14:30.412 --> 01:14:32.277
<i># Come on, Mama,
and scoodle um skoo #</i>

01:14:32.348 --> 01:14:35.146
<i># Scoodle um scoodle um,
and scoodle um skoo #</i>

01:14:35.251 --> 01:14:36.684
Just look for it on there.

01:14:36.752 --> 01:14:37.810
You see it on there?

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:39.182
I've been looking the whole time.

01:14:39.255 --> 01:14:40.552
Prairie View, Texas. The 127.

01:14:40.623 --> 01:14:42.750
You show me where to look
because it's not on--

01:14:42.825 --> 01:14:44.258
127 near Waxahachie.

01:14:44.326 --> 01:14:45.554
It's not there.

01:14:45.628 --> 01:14:47.653
It's there. You just can't find it.

01:14:47.730 --> 01:14:49.493
I see 2, and I see 7.

01:14:49.565 --> 01:14:52.329
Right. Now look for a 1 in front of it,
and you got it.

01:14:53.903 --> 01:14:54.835
- After 126--
- Okay.

01:14:54.904 --> 01:14:57.498
Before 128.

01:14:57.573 --> 01:14:59.404
I really don't think--

01:14:59.475 --> 01:15:00.407
You don't see it.

01:15:00.543 --> 01:15:01.908
When did you get this map?

01:15:43.886 --> 01:15:44.875
What are you doing?

01:15:44.987 --> 01:15:46.545
I'm gonna cut him down.

01:15:48.290 --> 01:15:50.451
Get back in the car. Shut the door.

01:15:51.894 --> 01:15:53.486
Nobody move.

01:15:55.197 --> 01:15:56.221
Just get down.

01:15:56.298 --> 01:15:58.596
Get down, get down.

01:16:02.104 --> 01:16:04.231
Get down, too. You get down, too.

01:16:19.388 --> 01:16:21.185
There's niggers in that car!

01:16:21.257 --> 01:16:22.451
Come on, come on!

01:16:36.005 --> 01:16:37.063
Get out of the car!

01:16:37.139 --> 01:16:38.333
Get out of that car!

01:16:38.407 --> 01:16:39.738
Stop that car right now!

01:17:10.539 --> 01:17:12.564
All right. Everybody sit tight,

01:17:12.641 --> 01:17:15.735
and, uh...

01:17:15.811 --> 01:17:17.278
I'll get the keys.

01:17:27.222 --> 01:17:28.712
How you doing, Miss Becker?

01:17:28.824 --> 01:17:29.950
I'm fine. You all right?

01:17:30.025 --> 01:17:30.957
Yes, ma'am.

01:17:31.026 --> 01:17:32.152
I got your rooms all ready.

01:17:32.227 --> 01:17:33.319
Thank you.

01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:39.865
Henry.

01:17:44.506 --> 01:17:45.996
Henry!

01:17:47.276 --> 01:17:48.641
Henry!

01:18:08.597 --> 01:18:10.189
They ain't going to wake up.

01:18:12.935 --> 01:18:13.959
Come on.

01:18:14.036 --> 01:18:14.968
Ha!

01:18:36.458 --> 01:18:37.584
See you.

01:18:38.627 --> 01:18:40.754
All right. Be good, all right?

01:18:49.905 --> 01:18:51.338
Hey, baby. How you doing?

01:18:53.242 --> 01:18:56.268
Why are you still up?
You waiting on me?

01:19:00.015 --> 01:19:02.415
What's the matter, baby?
Come on!

01:19:02.551 --> 01:19:03.745
Hey!

01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:06.112
Samantha!

01:19:08.290 --> 01:19:09.689
Shut up. Let's go.

01:19:09.758 --> 01:19:10.690
Hey, preacher boy.

01:19:10.759 --> 01:19:12.420
Shut up. Let's go.

01:19:12.494 --> 01:19:13.426
Come on.

01:19:13.495 --> 01:19:14.427
Where are we going?

01:19:14.496 --> 01:19:15.724
Back to our room.

01:19:19.301 --> 01:19:20.859
Got him, Mr. Tolson.

01:19:28.944 --> 01:19:31.344
# They come from Shevelstown #

01:19:31.413 --> 01:19:32.437
Shh!

01:19:32.514 --> 01:19:34.277
# Devil knocked my daddy down #

01:19:34.383 --> 01:19:35.509
- # Run, nigger, run #
- Shh!

01:19:35.617 --> 01:19:36.709
# Master's gonna get you #

01:19:36.819 --> 01:19:37.751
- # Run-- #
- Shh!

01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:40.288
Okay. Just sit-- sit--

01:19:40.389 --> 01:19:42.983
Not in that bed, though. Get up.

01:19:44.693 --> 01:19:45.921
Come here.

01:19:45.994 --> 01:19:47.655
Give me a hug.

01:19:49.431 --> 01:19:50.363
Stop!

01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:55.893
# Look down yonder, what do I see? #

01:19:55.971 --> 01:19:58.439
# Great big nigger
hangin' from a tree #

01:19:58.507 --> 01:20:00.532
# Run, nigger, run #

01:20:00.676 --> 01:20:01.904
You're worthless.

01:20:01.977 --> 01:20:03.604
What?

01:20:03.679 --> 01:20:06.409
You think you're the only one hurting?

01:20:07.583 --> 01:20:10.518
Um...

01:20:11.753 --> 01:20:15.712
Okay, I'm sorry...for everything.

01:20:15.824 --> 01:20:20.557
For, uh, for drinkin', yeah,

01:20:20.629 --> 01:20:22.824
I apologize.

01:20:22.898 --> 01:20:25.366
I'm not talking about me.

01:20:41.483 --> 01:20:43.383
You're right.

01:20:43.452 --> 01:20:45.579
I'm gonna go talk to her.

01:20:46.755 --> 01:20:48.279
No, no, you won't, Lowe.

01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:50.324
She doesn't need
to see you like this, okay?

01:20:50.392 --> 01:20:51.825
I'm just going to talk to her.

01:20:51.894 --> 01:20:53.156
Leave me alone.

01:20:53.228 --> 01:20:54.217
Lowe!

01:21:00.536 --> 01:21:02.003
Calm down, boy!

01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:03.594
Stop! Stop!

01:21:03.672 --> 01:21:04.730
I'm not playing with you.

01:21:04.806 --> 01:21:07.366
Calm-- Calm down!

01:21:07.409 --> 01:21:09.036
You crazy?

01:21:13.148 --> 01:21:15.173
You're never gonna forget what you saw
out there, do you understand?

01:21:15.284 --> 01:21:16.979
You're never gonna forget
what you saw out there.

01:21:17.085 --> 01:21:19.019
Hanging's the easiest
part of it sometimes.

01:21:19.087 --> 01:21:20.816
Sometimes they cut
the little fingers off,

01:21:20.889 --> 01:21:22.379
your toes, your nose, your ears.

01:21:22.491 --> 01:21:24.322
Sometimes they cut
your privates off.

01:21:24.393 --> 01:21:26.759
Sometimes they skin you alive.

01:21:30.265 --> 01:21:32.597
You'll never be able to forget.

01:21:47.549 --> 01:21:48.743
What do you think he did?

01:21:48.850 --> 01:21:50.943
He didn't have to do nothing, James!

01:21:51.053 --> 01:21:52.384
He didn't have to do nothing!

01:21:52.454 --> 01:21:54.922
In Texas they lynch Negroes!

01:21:55.023 --> 01:21:57.253
Do you understand?

01:21:57.326 --> 01:21:59.658
So it doesn't matter
how good we are, does it?

01:21:59.728 --> 01:22:01.593
What are you talk-- What?

01:22:01.730 --> 01:22:03.721
This is all useless.

01:22:03.799 --> 01:22:05.733
What are you talking about?

01:22:05.767 --> 01:22:08.497
I mean we're just a bunch of Negroes

01:22:08.537 --> 01:22:10.562
debating each other
on subjects we all agree on.

01:22:10.639 --> 01:22:13.540
Now, James, don't talk like that, all right?

01:22:13.609 --> 01:22:15.406
- Why not?
- Because you can't!

01:22:16.678 --> 01:22:18.737
Not you.

01:23:03.191 --> 01:23:05.785
Bye! God bless you!

01:23:09.531 --> 01:23:10.862
Where's Samantha?

01:23:10.932 --> 01:23:12.422
She's not going with us.

01:23:12.501 --> 01:23:13.468
Why not?

01:23:13.535 --> 01:23:16.003
Why do you think?

01:23:16.071 --> 01:23:18.130
I took her to the bus station.

01:23:18.206 --> 01:23:20.071
She wanted to go back to school.

01:23:21.810 --> 01:23:23.744
You wanted your chance.

01:23:25.213 --> 01:23:26.646
This is it.

01:23:31.687 --> 01:23:34.087
But how can any Negro

01:23:34.156 --> 01:23:36.886
defend the punishment of prison

01:23:36.958 --> 01:23:40.758
when he's seen so much oppression
in his own life?

01:23:40.829 --> 01:23:42.262
Yeah!

01:23:42.331 --> 01:23:44.026
How?

01:23:44.099 --> 01:23:48.536
Because crime itself
is a form of oppression,

01:23:48.603 --> 01:23:52.437
and Negroes fall victim
to more violent crime

01:23:52.507 --> 01:23:55.533
than any other race in America.

01:23:58.347 --> 01:23:59.814
For us,

01:23:59.915 --> 01:24:04.284
prison not only offers protection,
but retribution.

01:24:04.453 --> 01:24:05.477
Yes, indeed!

01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:10.457
And for the criminal, it is a dark gift:

01:24:10.525 --> 01:24:14.655
the hardship that introduces
a man to himself,

01:24:14.730 --> 01:24:17.995
that rouses his passion
for freedom--

01:24:18.066 --> 01:24:19.055
Yes, sir!

01:24:19.134 --> 01:24:20.692
...his hope for redemption!

01:24:20.769 --> 01:24:21.701
Oh, yeah!

01:24:28.810 --> 01:24:31.711
Our next debater from Wiley College,

01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:34.305
Mr. James Farmer, Junior.

01:24:34.416 --> 01:24:36.384
Mr. Farmer?

01:25:39.815 --> 01:25:40.975
Mom?

01:25:46.888 --> 01:25:47.855
Mom!

01:26:19.988 --> 01:26:21.319
Honey.

01:26:21.389 --> 01:26:22.481
Hey.

01:26:22.557 --> 01:26:23.751
Hi.

01:26:23.825 --> 01:26:25.190
Oh!

01:26:25.260 --> 01:26:26.750
Mmm!

01:26:26.828 --> 01:26:28.762
So?

01:26:30.732 --> 01:26:31.756
We lost.

01:26:31.833 --> 01:26:34.529
Oh. I'm sorry.

01:26:34.603 --> 01:26:37.834
Uh, this came.

01:26:39.741 --> 01:26:40.867
Harvard.

01:26:41.910 --> 01:26:43.207
Wonder what it says.

01:26:43.278 --> 01:26:45.143
Go on and open it and read it.

01:26:45.213 --> 01:26:47.340
- Looks like somebody opened it already.
- Not me.

01:26:48.550 --> 01:26:50.074
You didn't open it already?

01:26:50.185 --> 01:26:52.016
No.

01:26:52.087 --> 01:26:54.351
You are not a good liar.

01:26:59.060 --> 01:27:00.550
Out loud.

01:27:03.865 --> 01:27:05.264
"Dear Mr. Tolson,

01:27:05.333 --> 01:27:06.664
"thank you for informing us

01:27:06.701 --> 01:27:09.727
"about your historic victory
over Oklahoma City.

01:27:09.771 --> 01:27:12.205
"I'm sure you realize
our season is nearly over,

01:27:12.274 --> 01:27:14.469
"but today we received another letter
from Wiley College

01:27:14.543 --> 01:27:15.703
written by Mr. Henry Lowe"?

01:27:15.777 --> 01:27:16.801
Mm-hmm.

01:27:16.878 --> 01:27:18.004
With an "e"?

01:27:18.079 --> 01:27:19.842
"He told us from a student's perspective

01:27:19.948 --> 01:27:23.179
about your"-- ahem--
"about your undefeated season."

01:27:23.285 --> 01:27:24.650
Well, we're not undefeated anymore.

01:27:24.719 --> 01:27:25.947
Don't matter.

01:27:26.054 --> 01:27:28.522
"We wish to extend an invitation to--"

01:27:39.868 --> 01:27:41.631
"We wish to extend an invitation

01:27:41.703 --> 01:27:46.470
"to debate Harvard Crimson
here in Cambridge.

01:27:46.541 --> 01:27:50.136
Let us know if this is agreeable to you."

01:27:59.254 --> 01:28:00.186
Honey--

01:28:00.255 --> 01:28:01.153
Don't you tell anybody.

01:28:01.289 --> 01:28:02.381
No.

01:28:13.568 --> 01:28:15.160
No, you don't have to thank me.

01:28:15.236 --> 01:28:17.363
I just wanted to show you
I could write, too.

01:28:17.439 --> 01:28:19.100
That's good. Thank you.

01:28:20.976 --> 01:28:22.500
But you could do me a favor.

01:28:22.577 --> 01:28:23.737
What's that?

01:28:27.616 --> 01:28:29.379
Keep Samantha on the team.

01:28:32.554 --> 01:28:33.885
Why would I do that?

01:28:33.955 --> 01:28:37.049
Mr. Tolson, it was a rough night.

01:28:37.125 --> 01:28:40.492
Yes, it was, Mr. Lowe, for all of us.

01:28:40.562 --> 01:28:42.689
And she walked out on us
at the last minute.

01:28:42.764 --> 01:28:46.063
No, sir. She did not walk out on us.

01:28:47.235 --> 01:28:48.429
She walked out on me.

01:28:57.045 --> 01:28:59.240
It's good tea.

01:28:59.347 --> 01:29:02.180
Resolved:
Capitalism is immoral.

01:29:02.317 --> 01:29:05.286
We will be arguing the affirmative.

01:29:05.353 --> 01:29:07.253
To a bunch of Wall Street bankers.

01:29:09.958 --> 01:29:12.392
Mr. Tolson, I owe you
and my teammates--

01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:15.554
You're late. Come in. Sit down.

01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:26.632
Samantha, I am not--

01:29:36.651 --> 01:29:37.948
Resolved.

01:29:47.762 --> 01:29:50.822
Okay, you got macaroni
and cheese, fried chicken,

01:29:50.899 --> 01:29:52.332
black-eyed peas for good luck,

01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:55.062
red beans and rice,
corn bread, candied yams.

01:29:55.136 --> 01:29:56.967
I put some peach cobbler in there, too,

01:29:57.038 --> 01:29:58.130
and some bread pudding.

01:29:58.206 --> 01:30:01.403
I know you don't like bread pudding,
but I put it in there anyway.

01:30:01.543 --> 01:30:02.703
Thank you, Mom.

01:30:02.777 --> 01:30:03.709
Okay.

01:30:03.778 --> 01:30:05.109
Good luck, son.

01:30:07.082 --> 01:30:08.515
Dad?

01:30:08.583 --> 01:30:10.380
Yes, Jim.

01:30:13.488 --> 01:30:16.082
You give Boston my regards.

01:30:16.157 --> 01:30:17.249
You hear?

01:30:17.325 --> 01:30:18.883
Yes, sir.

01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:20.120
James!

01:30:20.195 --> 01:30:21.787
Come on! Train's leaving.

01:30:21.863 --> 01:30:23.455
Coming!

01:30:30.805 --> 01:30:32.136
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye-bye.

01:30:32.207 --> 01:30:33.196
I love you.

01:30:33.274 --> 01:30:34.298
Bye, sis.

01:30:35.910 --> 01:30:37.138
Love you!

01:30:37.212 --> 01:30:38.270
Love you, too.

01:30:42.117 --> 01:30:45.780
All aboard leaving for Texarkana, Little Rock,

01:30:45.887 --> 01:30:49.653
St. Louis, and all points north!

01:30:49.724 --> 01:30:51.817
All aboard!

01:30:51.893 --> 01:30:53.485
I'm not going with you.

01:30:53.561 --> 01:30:55.188
What?

01:30:55.263 --> 01:30:56.594
I cannot leave this state.

01:30:56.664 --> 01:30:58.256
It's a condition of my bail.

01:30:58.333 --> 01:30:59.630
You can't let them stop you.

01:30:59.701 --> 01:31:01.362
They're not stopping me.

01:31:01.503 --> 01:31:05.098
I just don't want to
jeopardize your opportunity.

01:31:05.173 --> 01:31:06.504
You can win without me.

01:31:06.541 --> 01:31:08.372
This is what you wanted
to do all along, isn't it?

01:31:08.409 --> 01:31:09.842
He's right.

01:31:09.911 --> 01:31:11.970
Why didn't you tell us this before?

01:31:12.046 --> 01:31:13.673
Because I didn't want
to hear your arguments.

01:31:13.782 --> 01:31:15.682
I knew they'd be too good.

01:31:21.956 --> 01:31:24.322
All right, Mr. Lowe, you're in charge.

01:31:24.392 --> 01:31:27.850
Whatever your instincts
tell you, you listen.

01:31:27.929 --> 01:31:28.861
Yes, sir.

01:31:28.930 --> 01:31:29.919
Let's go.

01:31:31.432 --> 01:31:32.524
Let's go.

01:31:34.335 --> 01:31:36.030
What are we supposed
to do without you?

01:31:36.104 --> 01:31:38.265
Win.

01:33:05.660 --> 01:33:08.185
Chicago Express, with service to Hartford,

01:33:08.229 --> 01:33:10.493
New York, and Philadelphia,

01:33:10.531 --> 01:33:13.500
now boarding, Track 29.

01:33:19.207 --> 01:33:20.936
I thought somebody was
supposed to meet us.

01:33:27.415 --> 01:33:28.609
Wiley College?

01:33:28.716 --> 01:33:29.648
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:33:29.717 --> 01:33:30.741
I'm Harland Osbourne.

01:33:30.852 --> 01:33:33.320
Harvard has put me in charge of you
for the time that you'll be here in Boston.

01:33:33.388 --> 01:33:35.652
- How you doing? I'm Henry Lowe.
- Mr. Lowe.

01:33:35.723 --> 01:33:37.054
- James Farmer, Jr.
- Mr. Farmer.

01:33:37.125 --> 01:33:38.649
- Samantha Booke.
- Of course. Miss Booke.

01:33:38.726 --> 01:33:41.456
We should be going.
My car's out front.

01:33:41.529 --> 01:33:42.461
I've got it.

01:33:42.530 --> 01:33:43.462
Oh, thank you.

01:33:43.531 --> 01:33:44.725
Just so you know,

01:33:44.799 --> 01:33:46.494
you'll be staying on campus
in Douglas Hall.

01:33:46.567 --> 01:33:47.761
I've got to tell you,

01:33:47.835 --> 01:33:49.530
this debate is stirring up
a lot of excitement.

01:33:49.604 --> 01:33:50.764
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

01:33:50.838 --> 01:33:53.306
It's gonna be broadcast
all over America.

01:33:53.374 --> 01:33:56.002
Can we see where we're
going to debate?

01:33:56.077 --> 01:33:57.101
Of course.

01:34:24.906 --> 01:34:27.932
Hello, Harvard!

01:34:43.257 --> 01:34:44.349
Excuse me.

01:34:44.425 --> 01:34:46.552
You supposed to be here?

01:34:49.130 --> 01:34:51.963
I guess we'll find out, won't we?

01:35:07.682 --> 01:35:08.808
Ah!

01:35:12.687 --> 01:35:13.745
Well, look.

01:35:13.855 --> 01:35:15.049
"Mr. Farmer."

01:35:19.994 --> 01:35:22.258
$5.00?

01:35:22.330 --> 01:35:23.490
Lowe, I got $5.00.

01:35:23.564 --> 01:35:25.862
Yeah, I did, too. It's called per diem.

01:35:25.933 --> 01:35:27.400
Hoo-hoo!

01:35:27.468 --> 01:35:29.299
You want me to hold it for you?

01:35:29.370 --> 01:35:31.304
No, not my $5.00.

01:35:37.979 --> 01:35:41.642
I got $5.00. I got $5.00.

01:35:41.749 --> 01:35:42.716
Me, too.

01:35:42.817 --> 01:35:44.910
Well, mine is crispy.

01:35:46.621 --> 01:35:51.183
James, this is high tea, all right?

01:35:51.259 --> 01:35:55.195
We nibble. We do not devour.

01:35:55.263 --> 01:35:57.128
How do you know?

01:35:57.198 --> 01:35:58.825
I don't.

01:36:00.601 --> 01:36:02.865
Hello. I'm Wilson.

01:36:02.937 --> 01:36:05.269
This is for you.

01:36:05.339 --> 01:36:06.772
Thank you.

01:36:09.377 --> 01:36:12.210
I can't accept that, sir.

01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:14.180
It would be inappropriate.

01:36:19.787 --> 01:36:21.414
It would be inappropriate.

01:36:24.192 --> 01:36:25.159
Who's it from?

01:36:25.226 --> 01:36:26.352
It's from Harvard.

01:36:26.427 --> 01:36:27.758
Maybe it's more money.

01:36:27.829 --> 01:36:28.887
Hmm.

01:36:28.963 --> 01:36:31.488
"We have been informed
by Tau Kappa Gamma

01:36:31.566 --> 01:36:33.329
"that your team delivers--

01:36:34.602 --> 01:36:36.763
"canned speeches:

01:36:36.838 --> 01:36:40.831
"arguments written by faculty
rather than students.

01:36:40.908 --> 01:36:42.603
"Therefore, we are
changing the topic.

01:36:42.677 --> 01:36:44.542
"You will have
the same amount of time

01:36:44.612 --> 01:36:46.705
"to write new arguments
as the Harvard team:

01:36:46.814 --> 01:36:48.372
48 hours."

01:36:49.817 --> 01:36:52.149
Coaches help students all the time.

01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:53.312
Yes, sir.

01:36:53.421 --> 01:36:55.616
"Both teams will be delivered

01:36:55.690 --> 01:36:56.782
the same reference books."

01:36:56.858 --> 01:36:57.825
Yes, sir.

01:36:57.892 --> 01:36:59.018
"Our new topic:
Resolved:

01:36:59.093 --> 01:37:01.823
"Civil disobedience is a moral weapon
in the fight for justice."

01:37:01.963 --> 01:37:04.557
Wiley College will be
arguing the affirmative."

01:37:04.632 --> 01:37:05.792
Thank you, sir.

01:37:09.237 --> 01:37:11.933
I can't reach Mr. Tolson.
Nobody knows where he is.

01:37:12.006 --> 01:37:14.531
They're setting us up to lose.

01:37:14.609 --> 01:37:16.440
We can't win without him.

01:37:16.511 --> 01:37:19.173
<i>You're wrong.
We can't win without him.</i>

01:37:23.317 --> 01:37:24.807
Thoreau?

01:37:24.919 --> 01:37:27.217
"...less desponding free spirits,

01:37:27.288 --> 01:37:28.516
is in her prisons--"

01:37:28.589 --> 01:37:31.659
"Under a government
which imprisons any unjustly,

01:37:31.694 --> 01:37:33.092
the true place for a just man--"

01:37:33.161 --> 01:37:34.651
Here's your coffee, sir.

01:37:34.729 --> 01:37:36.356
Thank you, Mr. Wilson.

01:37:36.430 --> 01:37:37.829
Just Wilson.

01:37:37.899 --> 01:37:39.025
Thank you, Wilson.

01:37:39.100 --> 01:37:40.192
"...has provided for her freer

01:37:40.268 --> 01:37:41.292
"and less desponding spirits--"

01:37:42.837 --> 01:37:44.771
But you have to use
the Massacre at Amritsar.

01:37:44.839 --> 01:37:46.306
Agreed, James,

01:37:46.374 --> 01:37:48.137
but we'll save it for the rebuttal.

01:37:48.209 --> 01:37:50.109
We're going to save the best for last

01:37:50.178 --> 01:37:52.078
because you have
to leave the audience--

01:37:52.146 --> 01:37:55.547
I think we should get into Gandhi's
concept of Satyagraha.

01:37:55.650 --> 01:37:56.947
I don't agree.

01:37:57.051 --> 01:37:58.575
I don't think people
are gonna understand what--

01:37:58.686 --> 01:38:00.347
what-- Sadagara?

01:38:00.488 --> 01:38:02.353
Sactchmaget? Sactchma--

01:38:02.423 --> 01:38:03.390
Satyagraha.

01:38:03.457 --> 01:38:04.924
From the Sanskrit.

01:38:05.026 --> 01:38:08.393
Meaning truth and fairness.

01:38:16.070 --> 01:38:17.503
I told you.

01:38:17.572 --> 01:38:18.698
It's-- It's obvious to me

01:38:18.773 --> 01:38:20.434
that we should begin
the debate with Gandhi.

01:38:20.508 --> 01:38:21.975
That's exactly why I won't do it.

01:38:22.043 --> 01:38:23.476
Why should I do the obvious thing?

01:38:23.544 --> 01:38:24.670
Because that's what wins debates!

01:38:24.745 --> 01:38:26.610
Listen to what you're saying.
This is Harvard, okay?

01:38:26.681 --> 01:38:28.911
The first thing you think
when you think civil disobedience is what?

01:38:29.016 --> 01:38:30.278
That's why we should use Gandhi!

01:38:30.384 --> 01:38:31.612
But Gandhi is a strong point!

01:38:31.719 --> 01:38:33.619
I want to win! Do you want to win?

01:38:33.688 --> 01:38:35.747
Yes, I want to win, but he's right!

01:38:35.856 --> 01:38:37.016
This is not getting us anywhere!

01:38:37.091 --> 01:38:38.388
Tolson told me I was in charge!

01:38:38.459 --> 01:38:39.721
He didn't put you in charge!

01:38:39.794 --> 01:38:41.557
You're "in charge" does not mean--

01:38:41.629 --> 01:38:42.755
So I can make decisions.

01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:44.127
We're not starting with Gandhi!

01:38:44.198 --> 01:38:45.324
Yes, we are!

01:38:45.399 --> 01:38:47.333
Do you hear yourself?
You sound like a kid!

01:38:47.401 --> 01:38:49.028
Well, you are a kid!

01:38:49.103 --> 01:38:50.570
Fellas, come on!

01:38:50.638 --> 01:38:52.265
- I'm an idiot?
- Yes!

01:38:52.340 --> 01:38:53.807
To hell with you!
To hell with you!

01:38:53.874 --> 01:38:55.000
To hell with this debate!

01:38:55.076 --> 01:38:56.941
To hell with me?
To hell with me?

01:38:57.011 --> 01:38:58.672
Just because I disagree with you?

01:38:58.746 --> 01:38:59.906
If you're gonna walk out, fine!

01:38:59.981 --> 01:39:02.142
We're not chasing you!

01:39:02.316 --> 01:39:06.616
We are so tired of chasing you!

01:39:12.193 --> 01:39:13.387
He's coming back, isn't he?

01:39:13.461 --> 01:39:15.053
See if I care!

01:40:20.194 --> 01:40:21.559
How you doing, man?

01:41:21.856 --> 01:41:23.721
You're beautiful when you're asleep.

01:41:36.170 --> 01:41:37.637
Henry, I--

01:41:37.705 --> 01:41:39.935
Yeah, I know, I know.

01:41:40.007 --> 01:41:43.465
But you can't stop me
from looking at you.

01:41:43.544 --> 01:41:46.945
Can everybody shut up and go to bed?

01:41:47.014 --> 01:41:49.778
James, come on, wake up.

01:41:49.884 --> 01:41:51.112
No.

01:41:51.218 --> 01:41:52.185
James.

01:41:56.957 --> 01:41:58.857
Come on, James, get up.

01:42:05.065 --> 01:42:06.464
What?

01:42:11.672 --> 01:42:13.663
What is this?

01:42:13.741 --> 01:42:16.209
That's my notes.

01:42:17.945 --> 01:42:20.004
What are you giving them to me for?

01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:21.843
Because you're debating, not me.

01:42:21.949 --> 01:42:24.440
What?

01:42:24.552 --> 01:42:26.486
It's your turn, James.

01:42:26.554 --> 01:42:27.919
You serious?

01:42:29.356 --> 01:42:30.414
You're crazy.

01:42:30.491 --> 01:42:32.652
At 14, you're just as good as me.

01:42:32.726 --> 01:42:34.091
The judges will love you.

01:42:34.161 --> 01:42:35.355
No. No. You can't quit.

01:42:35.429 --> 01:42:37.454
I'm not quitting, Samantha.

01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:43.066
Tolson made me captain,
and he said you were ready.

01:42:43.137 --> 01:42:45.002
Yeah, but you saw me at Howard.

01:42:45.072 --> 01:42:46.266
I was horrible.

01:42:46.340 --> 01:42:47.864
That's right. You did terrible, didn't you?

01:42:47.942 --> 01:42:49.239
Stunk up the whole joint, right?

01:42:49.310 --> 01:42:51.039
So you should just quit, right?

01:42:51.111 --> 01:42:52.544
You should just give up.

01:42:56.217 --> 01:42:57.206
No.

01:43:02.990 --> 01:43:04.924
Who's the judge?

01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:07.559
What?

01:43:07.595 --> 01:43:09.722
Who's the judge?

01:43:12.032 --> 01:43:14.193
The judge is God.

01:43:15.469 --> 01:43:17.198
And why is he God?

01:43:18.906 --> 01:43:23.741
Because he decides who wins or loses,
not my opponent.

01:43:23.811 --> 01:43:26.746
And who is your opponent?

01:43:26.814 --> 01:43:29.339
He doesn't exist.

01:43:29.450 --> 01:43:32.214
Why doesn't he exist?

01:43:32.319 --> 01:43:34.810
Because he is a mere a dissenting voice

01:43:34.922 --> 01:43:36.981
to the truth that I speak.

01:43:39.727 --> 01:43:40.955
That's right.

01:43:41.028 --> 01:43:43.019
Speak the truth.

01:43:44.465 --> 01:43:47.025
Direct from Harvard Memorial Hall

01:43:47.101 --> 01:43:48.966
in Cambridge, Massachusetts,

01:43:49.036 --> 01:43:52.802
this is WNBC Radio,
bringing to you live

01:43:52.873 --> 01:43:54.534
tonight's history-making debate

01:43:54.608 --> 01:43:58.135
between little Wiley College
from Marshall, Texas,

01:43:58.212 --> 01:44:00.612
and the Harvard University Debate team,

01:44:00.748 --> 01:44:01.942
the first time ever

01:44:02.049 --> 01:44:04.381
a Negro college has faced
the national champions.

01:44:04.451 --> 01:44:05.509
Harvard's Dean of Students

01:44:05.619 --> 01:44:07.484
is making his way to the podium now.

01:44:07.521 --> 01:44:09.921
The crowd, as if on cue, falls silent.

01:44:11.258 --> 01:44:13.192
On this historic occasion,

01:44:13.260 --> 01:44:16.195
we welcome the distinguished team
from Wiley College,

01:44:16.263 --> 01:44:19.357
our illustrious judges, you the audience,

01:44:19.433 --> 01:44:22.925
and through the wonder
of radio, the nation.

01:44:23.003 --> 01:44:27.269
Harvard University celebrates
its 300th anniversary this year,

01:44:27.341 --> 01:44:31.971
and, in Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
its fifth President of the United States.

01:44:32.046 --> 01:44:35.982
<i>But no university, no matter how grand
or august in its history,</i>

01:44:36.083 --> 01:44:38.608
<i>can afford to live in the past.</i>

01:44:38.719 --> 01:44:42.485
<i>So, in the spirit of tomorrow,</i>

01:44:42.556 --> 01:44:45.491
<i>I introduce to you today.:</i>

01:44:46.727 --> 01:44:48.695
the debaters from Wiley College:

01:44:48.762 --> 01:44:50.127
Miss Samantha Booke,

01:44:50.197 --> 01:44:52.188
Mr. James Farmer, Junior.

01:44:53.601 --> 01:44:55.125
What?

01:45:03.944 --> 01:45:07.345
Mr. Farmer will argue the first affirmative.

01:45:26.567 --> 01:45:28.831
Resolved:

01:45:28.902 --> 01:45:32.360
Civil disobedience is a moral weapon

01:45:32.439 --> 01:45:35.374
in the fight for justice.

01:45:35.442 --> 01:45:38.570
But how can disobedience
ever be moral?

01:45:38.646 --> 01:45:40.011
Well, I guess that depends

01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:42.913
on one's definition of the words.

01:45:43.017 --> 01:45:44.006
Word.

01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:48.887
In 1919, in India,

01:45:48.956 --> 01:45:53.620
10,000 people gathered in Amritsar
to protest the tyranny of British rule.

01:45:53.694 --> 01:45:54.752
Has it started?

01:45:54.828 --> 01:45:55.886
- Shh!
- Your brother's talking.

01:45:55.963 --> 01:45:57.191
Just sit down.

01:45:57.264 --> 01:46:00.427
General Reginald Dyer
trapped them in a courtyard

01:46:00.567 --> 01:46:05.527
and ordered his troops
to fire into the crowd for ten minutes.

01:46:05.606 --> 01:46:07.631
379 died--

01:46:07.675 --> 01:46:12.806
men, women, children--

01:46:12.846 --> 01:46:14.575
Shot down in cold blood.

01:46:14.682 --> 01:46:19.119
Dyer said he had
taught them a moral lesson.

01:46:19.219 --> 01:46:23.019
Gandhi and his followers responded
not with violence

01:46:23.090 --> 01:46:27.390
but with an organized
campaign of non-cooperation.

01:46:27.461 --> 01:46:30.123
Government buildings were occupied.

01:46:30.197 --> 01:46:32.825
<i>Streets were blocked
with people who refused to rise,</i>

01:46:32.900 --> 01:46:35.801
<i>even when beaten by police.</i>

01:46:35.869 --> 01:46:38.269
Gandhi was arrested,

01:46:38.338 --> 01:46:41.637
but the British were soon
forced to release him.

01:46:41.709 --> 01:46:45.839
He called it a moral victory.

01:46:45.913 --> 01:46:48.245
The definition of moral:

01:46:48.348 --> 01:46:52.751
Dyer's lesson or Gandhi's victory?

01:46:52.820 --> 01:46:54.287
You choose.

01:47:12.039 --> 01:47:15.236
From 1914 to 1918,

01:47:15.309 --> 01:47:20.508
for every single minute
the world was at war,

01:47:20.581 --> 01:47:24.574
four men laid down their lives.

01:47:24.685 --> 01:47:27.119
Just think of it.

01:47:27.187 --> 01:47:32.420
240 brave young men
were hurled into eternity

01:47:32.493 --> 01:47:35.894
every hour of every day, of every night,

01:47:35.963 --> 01:47:38.659
for four long years.

01:47:40.634 --> 01:47:44.070
35,000 hours.

01:47:44.138 --> 01:47:50.543
8,281,000 casualties.

01:47:52.479 --> 01:47:54.310
240.

01:47:55.516 --> 01:47:57.643
240.

01:47:57.751 --> 01:48:02.188
240.

01:48:02.356 --> 01:48:03.789
Here was a slaughter

01:48:03.857 --> 01:48:08.089
immeasurably greater than
what happened at Amritsar.

01:48:08.128 --> 01:48:11.620
Can there be anything moral about it?

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:14.399
Nothing...

01:48:14.468 --> 01:48:16.299
except that it stopped Germany

01:48:16.370 --> 01:48:18.270
from enslaving all of Europe.

01:48:18.338 --> 01:48:23.207
Civil disobedience isn't moral
because it's non-violent.

01:48:23.277 --> 01:48:26.246
Fighting for your country with violence

01:48:26.313 --> 01:48:28.781
can be deeply moral,

01:48:28.882 --> 01:48:34.047
demanding the greatest
sacrifice of all:

01:48:34.154 --> 01:48:36.452
life itself.

01:48:36.523 --> 01:48:39.959
Non-violence is the mask
civil disobedience wears

01:48:40.060 --> 01:48:43.587
to conceal its true face--

01:48:43.664 --> 01:48:46.155
anarchy.

01:48:57.611 --> 01:49:00.375
Gandhi believes one must always act

01:49:00.547 --> 01:49:03.345
with love and respect
for one's opponents,

01:49:03.450 --> 01:49:05.975
even if they are Harvard debaters.

01:49:07.588 --> 01:49:11.524
Gandhi also believes
that lawbreakers must accept

01:49:11.592 --> 01:49:14.857
the legal consequences for their actions.

01:49:14.928 --> 01:49:17.055
Does that sound like anarchy?

01:49:17.130 --> 01:49:22.397
Civil disobedience is not something
for us to fear.

01:49:22.469 --> 01:49:25.495
It is, after all, an American concept.

01:49:25.572 --> 01:49:27.904
You see, Gandhi draws his inspiration

01:49:27.975 --> 01:49:29.772
not from a Hindu scripture,

01:49:29.843 --> 01:49:31.834
but from Henry David Thoreau,

01:49:31.912 --> 01:49:34.437
who I believe graduated from Harvard

01:49:34.548 --> 01:49:44.791
<i>and lived by a pond
not too far from here.</i>

01:49:44.826 --> 01:49:47.988
My opponent is right about one thing.

01:49:48.061 --> 01:49:50.586
Thoreau was a Harvard grad,

01:49:50.664 --> 01:49:55.397
and, like many of us, a bit self-righteous.

01:49:57.905 --> 01:50:03.104
He once said, "Any man
more right than his neighbors

01:50:03.143 --> 01:50:06.874
constitutes a majority of one."

01:50:06.914 --> 01:50:10.645
Thoreau the idealist could never know

01:50:10.751 --> 01:50:14.778
that Adolf Hitler
would agree with his words.

01:50:14.888 --> 01:50:20.019
The beauty and the burden
of democracy is this:

01:50:20.093 --> 01:50:25.463
no idea prevails without
the support of the majority.

01:50:25.532 --> 01:50:28.365
The people decide
the moral issues of the day,

01:50:28.435 --> 01:50:30.801
not a majority of one.

01:50:30.871 --> 01:50:35.331
Majorities do not decide
what is right or wrong.

01:50:35.409 --> 01:50:37.377
Your conscience does.

01:50:37.444 --> 01:50:40.106
So why should a citizen

01:50:40.180 --> 01:50:42.671
surrender his or her conscience

01:50:42.783 --> 01:50:44.114
to a legislator?

01:50:44.217 --> 01:50:48.381
No, we must never, ever kneel down

01:50:48.455 --> 01:50:51.356
before the tyranny of a majority.

01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:03.327
We can't decide which laws
to obey and which to ignore.

01:51:03.470 --> 01:51:05.995
If we could...

01:51:06.073 --> 01:51:07.700
I'd never stop for a red light.

01:51:09.576 --> 01:51:11.601
My father is one of those men

01:51:11.678 --> 01:51:15.409
that stands between us and chaos:

01:51:15.515 --> 01:51:17.983
a police officer.

01:51:18.085 --> 01:51:24.024
I remember the day
his partner, his best friend,

01:51:24.091 --> 01:51:26.753
was gunned down in the line of duty.

01:51:28.762 --> 01:51:31.526
Most vividly of all,

01:51:31.598 --> 01:51:35.090
I remember the expression
on my dad's face.

01:51:37.204 --> 01:51:43.109
Nothing that erodes
the rule of law can be moral,

01:51:43.176 --> 01:51:47.704
no matter what name we give it.

01:51:50.217 --> 01:51:51.980
Bravo!

01:52:36.129 --> 01:52:37.255
Why doesn't he say something?

01:52:37.330 --> 01:52:38.558
Shh!

01:52:55.115 --> 01:52:58.676
In Texas...

01:52:58.785 --> 01:53:00.650
they lynch Negroes.

01:53:03.056 --> 01:53:05.024
<i>My teammates and I</i>

01:53:05.092 --> 01:53:09.358
saw a man strung up by his neck

01:53:09.396 --> 01:53:10.954
and set on fire.

01:53:13.433 --> 01:53:17.494
We drove through a lynch mob,

01:53:17.571 --> 01:53:20.972
pressed our faces
against the floorboard.

01:53:24.111 --> 01:53:27.137
I looked at my teammates.

01:53:27.214 --> 01:53:30.240
I saw the fear in their eyes...

01:53:32.652 --> 01:53:35.621
and worse...

01:53:35.722 --> 01:53:36.984
the shame.

01:53:40.227 --> 01:53:42.821
What was this Negro's crime

01:53:42.896 --> 01:53:45.330
that he should be hung, without trial,

01:53:45.398 --> 01:53:47.958
in a dark forest filled with fog?

01:53:48.034 --> 01:53:52.027
Was he a thief?

01:53:52.105 --> 01:53:55.233
Was he a killer?

01:53:55.308 --> 01:53:56.832
Or just a Negro?

01:53:59.112 --> 01:54:01.740
Was he a sharecropper?

01:54:01.915 --> 01:54:04.042
<i>A preacher?</i>

01:54:04.151 --> 01:54:07.177
<i>Were his children waiting up for him?</i>

01:54:07.220 --> 01:54:13.318
And who are we to just
lie there and do nothing?

01:54:15.996 --> 01:54:21.195
No matter what he did,
the mob was the criminal.

01:54:21.268 --> 01:54:24.567
But the law did nothing,

01:54:24.638 --> 01:54:27.971
just left us wondering why.

01:54:34.214 --> 01:54:36.079
My opponent says

01:54:36.183 --> 01:54:40.347
nothing that erodes the rule
of law can be moral.

01:54:40.453 --> 01:54:43.286
But there is no rule of law
in the Jim Crow South,

01:54:43.356 --> 01:54:45.824
not when Negroes are denied housing,

01:54:45.926 --> 01:54:48.451
turned away from schools, hospitals,

01:54:48.528 --> 01:54:50.758
and not when we are lynched.

01:54:55.302 --> 01:54:56.701
St. Augustine said,

01:54:56.770 --> 01:55:01.298
<i>"An unjust law is no law at all, "</i>

01:55:01.441 --> 01:55:03.272
which means I have a right,

01:55:03.343 --> 01:55:06.005
even a duty, to resist...

01:55:08.348 --> 01:55:13.047
with violence or civil disobedience.

01:55:17.424 --> 01:55:19.949
You should pray I choose the latter.

01:55:33.340 --> 01:55:35.433
Bravo!

01:55:51.691 --> 01:55:52.953
<i>In tonight's debate</i>

01:55:53.026 --> 01:55:58.726
between Harvard University
and Wiley College...

01:56:02.002 --> 01:56:03.697
And the winner is...

01:56:26.593 --> 01:56:28.254
Wiley College.

01:56:28.328 --> 01:56:30.922
Yeah!
