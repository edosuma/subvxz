I really appreciate it.

the $500 rush fee.

a cool-kid name--Clay.

on this.

That's a rental.

stabbed in the heart

09:20.010 --> 09:22.450
by my best friend
and left in the dust

09:22.490 --> 09:25.410
for his girlfriend's cooler
and more popular son.

09:25.450 --> 09:27.320
Yeah, I feel you.

09:27.370 --> 09:30.420
My girlfriend left me
for a programmer.

09:30.460 --> 09:32.510
Programmers get
all the play.

09:32.540 --> 09:35.020
Mind if I talk to you in
an effort to make him jealous?

09:35.070 --> 09:37.850
As long as you take
a pamphlet,

09:37.900 --> 09:40.380
I don't care
what your motivations are.

09:40.420 --> 09:43.600
Oh, Walter,
you are hilarious!

09:43.640 --> 09:46.780
You have the best booth
at the whole fair,

09:46.820 --> 09:49.780

your new best friend

nice to hear.

we're getting close,

I should be honest
with you.

10:02.920 --> 10:06.660

There, I said it.

he circled--"donate plasma."

signing some forms

10:59.070 --> 11:00.340

11:56.860 --> 11:58.860
She's looking
at magic schools...

12:41.860 --> 12:43.730
Mike heard that I liked
to play baseball,

12:43.780 --> 12:45.300
so he took me
to see the Giants.

12:45.350 --> 12:48.360
Before Mike was Hank, and he
saw me playing Mario Kart,

12:48.390 --> 12:49.830

misunderstood a joke I made

12:53.790 --> 12:57.920

Point is, guys always pretend to
give a crap about what I like,

17:39.070 --> 17:40.730
He was in Antarctica.

17:40.770 --> 17:41.950
Yeah, he wanted
to stay there

17:41.990 --> 17:43.770
and watch the birth
of an albino penguin

17:43.820 --> 17:46.470
rather than see the birth
of his own child.

17:46.520 --> 17:51.090
I would have loved to have
someone who loved me by my side,

17:51.130 --> 17:52.610
and the fact
that you're choosing

17:52.650 --> 17:56.570
not to be with each other
is a bit of a slap in the face

17:56.610 --> 17:59.270
for those of us that didn't
actually have a choice.

you played basketball.

everywhere for you.

of the "stew and swish."

Yeah.

Not so great at the swish.

You know, I--We do so much
awesome stuff together,

19:14.300 --> 19:16.260

just this once

19:16.300 --> 19:18.560
if I did some cool stuff
with somebody else.

19:18.610 --> 19:21.610
No, you know what?
It's fine. I understand.

19:21.650 --> 19:24.610

a more natural fit for you.

He's more your speed.

Look, Marcus, listen, buddy,
he's not replacing you, man.

19:43.810 --> 19:45.680
He could never do that.

It's just--it's really important
to Liz that I get to know him.

it was--it was for Liz?

- Yeah.

Clay mentioned something
about you tagging along with us

Yes, um,
here's the thing--

- He can't wait.
- I can't?

20:09.140 --> 20:11.700
Nope, I promised
the computer virus guy

20:11.750 --> 20:12.750
that I'd hang with him.

20:12.790 --> 20:14.010
You know,
I was actually worried

20:14.050 --> 20:15.710
Will would have nothing to do
this afternoon,

20:15.750 --> 20:17.880

off my hands.

some double-doubles.
