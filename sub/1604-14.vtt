a list of Soviet spies.

normally take months to plan.

it would be in Damascus by now.

I can only assume, Harold, that
Madeline has a Russian patron,

protect the identities of the Kungur Six.

They made bank deposits on Friday.

He forgot his glasses.

11:04.372 --> 11:07.079
I gave the signal, but nothing.

I'd convinced myself that Frank was
the only thing I had in the world,

11:12.589 --> 11:14.671
so the night manager
was an easy decision.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.757
What did you--?
I seduced him into the alley.

11:18.761 --> 11:19.921
And then what?

11:20.096 --> 11:25.386
I played him for a little bit,
then I kissed him off, told him
he'd get more next week.

11:26.644 --> 11:28.225
And Frank and I went away.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.600
And lived happily ever after. The end.

didn't believe in happily ever after.

Wait. The job. It's yours.

An autodialer can circumvent

12:28.289 --> 12:30.621
I'll supply equipment
that gets through a detector.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.123
What about physical security?

12:32.293 --> 12:36.502
There are two guards stationed outside
that strong room, armed and mobile.

12:36.673 --> 12:39.039
They do a hall sweep
every 20 minutes.

12:39.217 --> 12:42.801
When they take their patrol at 9:20,
you'll have 10 minutes.

Dirar Man/van, embassy official.

He has the security credentials

classified lower level.

12:54.565 --> 12:56.692
wears his ID on the lapel
of his jacket,

12:56.859 --> 12:59.396
easy enough to unclip
in a standard brush pass.

13:02.115 --> 13:06.028
This lift needs to be round-trip,
not one-way. Can't raise any flags.

I know someone
who can clone his badge

13:08.288 --> 13:10.574

It's Madeline Pratt's SIM card.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.377
I swiped it when I palmed her phone.

13:21.551 --> 13:24.714

You know how to palm a phone?

I won't. You will.
