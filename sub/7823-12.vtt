08:50.990 --> 08:54.190
Krusty the Clown,
beloved idol of countless tots

08:54.260 --> 08:57.360
now nothing more than a common
alleged criminal.

08:57.430 --> 08:59.560
His trial, which begins tomorrow

08:59.630 --> 09:02.300
has taken center ring
in a media circus

09:02.370 --> 09:04.710
as children of all ages,
from eight to 80

09:04.770 --> 09:06.600

09:06.680 --> 09:08.950
like so many
Romanian trapeze artists.

<i>From his humble beginnings
as a street mime in
Tupelo Mississippi</i>

<i>with dozens of endorsements</i>

09:16.620 --> 09:18.620
<i>including his own line
of pork products.</i>

09:18.690 --> 09:19.990
This may have led

09:20.060 --> 09:21.530
to one of television's
best-loved bloopers--

09:21.590 --> 09:25.100
Krusty's near-fatal on-the-air
heart attack in 1986.

09:25.160 --> 09:29.130
Wasn't that a great Itchy
and Scratchy cartoon, kids?

09:29.200 --> 09:31.700
Well, we've got another one
coming right up.

09:31.770 --> 09:33.800
But first I got a hankering

09:33.870 --> 09:36.270
for some pork products.

09:36.340 --> 09:40.780
Mmm, look--
plump, succulent sausage

and glistening, sizzling...

But a quick triple-bypass

09:54.860 --> 09:57.230
<i>and a pacemaker later</i>

09:57.290 --> 09:59.060
<i>Krusty bounced back.</i>

09:59.130 --> 10:00.870
However, he was a changed clown.

10:00.930 --> 10:01.970
<i>Where his show
had been condemned</i>

10:02.030 --> 10:03.630
<i>by parents and educators alike</i>

10:03.700 --> 10:05.770
<i>as simple-minded TV mayhem</i>

10:05.830 --> 10:08.800

a portion of every show

10:22.420 --> 10:26.390
I urge every halfway-decent

10:56.280 --> 10:59.210
HIS FACE IS SO
FLESH-COLORED AND SAD.

10:59.290 --> 11:02.630

11:07.260 --> 11:08.400
AT THIS TIME.

11:08.460 --> 11:09.790
I DIDN'T DO IT.

11:09.860 --> 11:12.930
( <i>laughter )</i>

11:14.670 --> 11:16.340
KRUSTY THE CLOWN,
HOW DO YOU PLEAD?

11:16.400 --> 11:18.700
I PLEAD GUILTY, YOUR HONOR.

11:21.010 --> 11:22.210
( <i>nervous laughter )</i>

11:22.280 --> 11:23.710
OH, I MEAN NOT GUILTY.

11:23.780 --> 11:25.720
OPENING-NIGHT JITTERS,
YOUR HONOR.

11:26.980 --> 11:28.890
I WOULD LIKE
TO CALL TO THE STAND

11:28.950 --> 11:29.890
HOMER G. SIMPSON.

11:29.950 --> 11:31.060
DON'T DO IT, DAD.

11:31.120 --> 11:32.390
PLEASE DON'T DO IT.

11:32.450 --> 11:33.450
SORRY, SON.

11:33.520 --> 11:34.590
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
ONE DAY.

11:34.660 --> 11:35.760
HE'S INNOCENT,
I TELL YA.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.280
KRUSTY WOULD NEVER DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

11:37.360 --> 11:39.660
DAD, YOU GOT TO LISTEN TO ME.

11:41.500 --> 11:42.530
Sorry, pal!

11:42.600 --> 11:43.530

11:43.600 --> 11:44.840

11:46.470 --> 11:47.840
MR. SIMPSON,
WAS THAT YOU

11:47.900 --> 11:49.230
TAKING THAT COWARDLY DIVE

11:49.300 --> 11:52.300
INTO THAT DISPLAY
OF HEAVILY-SALTED SNACK TREATS?

11:52.370 --> 11:53.200
YES, SIR.

11:53.270 --> 11:55.000
DO YOU RECOGNIZE THE GUNMAN

11:55.080 --> 11:56.480
IN THIS COURTROOM TODAY?

11:56.540 --> 11:57.140
YES, I DO.

11:57.210 --> 11:58.250
FINE.

11:58.310 --> 11:59.540
WOULD YOU
POINT HIM OUT TO US.

11:59.610 --> 12:01.240
OKAY.

12:10.960 --> 12:13.200
( <i>gasps )</i>

12:13.260 --> 12:14.630
OH, MAN.

12:14.700 --> 12:16.600
LET THE RECORD SHOW

12:16.670 --> 12:19.370
THAT THE WITNESS EVENTUALLY
POINTED TO...

12:19.430 --> 12:21.060
<i>KRUSTY THE CLOWN.</i>

12:24.010 --> 12:27.340
Marge:
THESE TOYS ARE JUST ADORABLE.

12:27.410 --> 12:30.580
WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED
THEY WERE INSPIRED

12:30.650 --> 12:32.650
BY AN INSANE CRIMINAL GENIUS?

12:34.780 --> 12:36.180
Bart:
<i>BUT DAD,</i>

12:36.250 --> 12:38.360
YOU'RE GIVING IN
TO MOB MENTALITY.

12:38.420 --> 12:39.390
NO, I'M NOT.

12:39.450 --> 12:41.020
I'M HOPPING
ON THE BANDWAGON.

12:41.090 --> 12:42.260
NOW, COME ON, SON.

12:42.320 --> 12:43.880
GET WITH
THE WINNING TEAM.

12:45.690 --> 12:47.150
RIGHT HERE, KRUSTY SOUVENIRS.

12:47.230 --> 12:48.800
BUY THEM AND BURN THEM.

( <i>crowd hums "Glory Halleluja"

12:50.900 --> 12:52.600
GOOD PEOPLE, I'M SO HAPPY
YOU'RE ALL HERE TONIGHT.

12:52.670 --> 12:55.410
BUT PLEASE,
JUST A FEW WORDS OF CAUTION.

12:55.470 --> 12:59.040
WE ARE GOING
TO SET THIS PILE OF EVIL ABLAZE

12:59.110 --> 13:01.010
BUT BECAUSE THESE
ARE CHILDREN'S TOYS

13:01.080 --> 13:02.680
THE FIRE WILL SPREAD QUICKLY

13:02.740 --> 13:04.370
SO PLEASE STAND BACK

13:04.450 --> 13:07.220
AND TRY NOT
TO INHALE THE TOXIC FUMES.

13:12.050 --> 13:13.650
( <i>crowd murmurs )</i>

13:16.960 --> 13:20.300
KRUSTY, WOULD YOU PLEASE TURN
YOUR ATTENTION TO EXHIBIT "B."

13:20.360 --> 13:22.630
TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE.

13:22.700 --> 13:24.970
UH, UM...

13:25.030 --> 13:26.690
WHICH ONE DO YOU MEAN?

13:26.770 --> 13:29.110
THE ONE WITH THE BIG "B" ON IT.

13:29.170 --> 13:30.370
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

13:30.440 --> 13:31.440
CAN'T YOU READ?

13:31.510 --> 13:32.610
NO, I CAN'T!

13:32.670 --> 13:34.440
I CAN'T READ OR WRITE.

13:34.510 --> 13:35.610
I ADMIT IT.

13:35.680 --> 13:37.210
I'M TOTALLY ILLITERATE.

13:37.280 --> 13:38.780
NOW ARE YOU HAPPY?

13:38.850 --> 13:41.490
CAN IT BE THAT THE CHAMPION
OF CHILD LITERACY

13:41.550 --> 13:42.850
CAN'T EVEN READ HIMSELF?

13:42.920 --> 13:44.590
IS IT A CRIME
TO BE ILLITERATE?

13:44.650 --> 13:45.980
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

13:46.050 --> 13:47.250
SEE THIS, KRUSTY?

13:47.320 --> 13:50.090
THIS A "B"
AND THIS IS EXHIBIT "B."

LOST SUBSTANTIAL SUMS OF MONEY

13:54.860 --> 13:56.090
ON SPORTS GAMBLING.

13:56.160 --> 13:58.930
IS IT A CRIME TO BET
ON SPORTING EVENTS?

13:59.000 --> 14:00.140
YES, IT IS.

14:00.200 --> 14:01.340

YES, WE HAVE, YOUR HONOR.

14:08.610 --> 14:10.810
WE FIND THE DEFENDANT
KRUSTY THE CLOWN...

14:13.010 --> 14:13.840
GUILTY.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.120
( <i>crowd gasps )</i>

14:15.180 --> 14:15.980
I KNEW IT!

14:16.050 --> 14:17.920
THIS HAPPENS TO ME EVERY TIME.

14:23.320 --> 14:26.150
My young friends,
for years I have been silent

14:26.230 --> 14:28.300
save for the crude glissandos

14:28.360 --> 14:29.890
of this primitive
wind instrument.

14:29.960 --> 14:33.160
But now destiny has thrust me
into the center ring.

14:33.230 --> 14:34.630
In the coming weeks

14:34.700 --> 14:37.060
you will notice some
sweeping changes in our program.

14:37.140 --> 14:38.780
Please do not be alarmed.

14:38.840 --> 14:41.550
Itchy and Scratchy
will still have a home here

14:41.610 --> 14:43.810
but we will also learn
about nutrition

14:43.880 --> 14:45.580
self-esteem, etiquette

14:45.650 --> 14:47.180
and all the lively arts.

14:47.250 --> 14:49.090
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING, LISE?!

14:49.150 --> 14:50.450
I'M WATCHING <i>SIDESHOW BOB.</i>

14:50.520 --> 14:53.590
HE'S A LOT LESS PATRONIZING
THAN KRUSTY USED TO BE.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.430
YOU BACKSTABBER,
YOU TRAITOR, YOU...

14:55.490 --> 14:57.090
( <i>slaps )
SNAP OUT OF IT, BART.</i>

14:57.160 --> 14:59.960
FACE THE FACTS.
ALL THOSE HOURS WE SPENT
STARING AT KRUSTY

15:00.030 --> 15:02.000
WE WERE STARING AT A CROOK.

15:02.060 --> 15:03.490
I KNOW KRUSTY'S INNOCENT.

15:03.570 --> 15:04.800
DON'T ASK ME WHY.

15:04.870 --> 15:07.040
IT'S JUST A FEELING I HAVE.

15:07.100 --> 15:08.010
OH, BART.

15:08.070 --> 15:09.210
I THINK I CAN PROVE

15:09.270 --> 15:10.310
KRUSTY'S INNOCENT

15:10.370 --> 15:12.080
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP.

15:12.140 --> 15:13.910
YOU DO? WHY?

15:13.980 --> 15:15.580
COME ON, YOU KNOW WHY.

15:15.640 --> 15:16.640
NO. WHY?

15:16.710 --> 15:18.180
I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU

15:18.250 --> 15:19.820
FOR MAKING ME SAY THIS.

15:19.880 --> 15:21.220
YOU'RE SMARTER THAN ME.

15:22.880 --> 15:23.910
SO YOU WITH ME?

15:23.990 --> 15:24.960
YEAH, MAN.

15:28.760 --> 15:29.890
WHOO!

15:29.960 --> 15:31.500
OKAY, DON'T TRY
ANYTHING FUNNY.

15:31.560 --> 15:33.030
I'M ARMED TO THE TEETH.

15:36.870 --> 15:37.670
BART, LOOK!

15:37.730 --> 15:39.790
OVER HERE ON THE MICROWAVE.

15:39.870 --> 15:41.070
SO? I DON'T HAVE

15:41.140 --> 15:42.170
A PACEMAKER.

15:42.240 --> 15:43.570
BART, THE TAPE SHOWED

15:43.640 --> 15:45.680
THAT THE ROBBER
HEATED UP A BURRITO.

15:45.740 --> 15:46.940
SO?

15:47.010 --> 15:47.980
DON'T YOU REMEMBER
THE GET-WELL CARD

15:48.040 --> 15:49.370
WE SENT TO KRUSTY?

15:49.440 --> 15:51.000
IT WAS AFTER HIS
HEART ATTACK

15:51.080 --> 15:53.150
WHEN HE HAD
A PACEMAKER PUT IN.

15:53.210 --> 15:54.140
AHA!

15:56.450 --> 15:57.390
WAIT A MINUTE.

15:57.450 --> 15:58.890
KRUSTY CAN'T READ.

15:58.950 --> 16:00.910
SO THE POOR GUY CAN'T READ.

16:00.990 --> 16:02.130
CAN'T WE
GET OFF HIS BACK ALREADY?

16:02.190 --> 16:03.760
NO, DON'T YOU GET IT, BART?

16:03.830 --> 16:06.600
HOW COULD KRUSTY
HAVE BEEN READING A MAGAZINE

16:06.660 --> 16:08.270
IF HE CAN'T READ?

16:08.330 --> 16:10.570

KRUSTY <i>WAS FRAMED.</i>

16:17.110 --> 16:18.680

I DON'T KNOW.

16:19.870 --> 16:21.740
BUT I KNOW SOMEONE WHO WOULD--

Bob:
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

18:56.960 --> 18:59.560
I BET THE OTHER CHILDREN
DON'T ACCEPT YOU.

18:59.630 --> 19:01.930
TRUE, BUT THAT
DOESN'T BOTHER ME.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.730
MY SISTERS AND I
HAVE BEEN DOING
A LITTLE INVESTIGATING

19:04.810 --> 19:07.710

KRUSTY WAS FRAMED.

GO NEAR THE THING

NOT WITH HIS PACEMAKER.

19:16.450 --> 19:17.750

19:17.820 --> 19:19.920
AS I LOVE KRUSTY,
HE WAS NEVER ONE

19:19.990 --> 19:22.390
TO TAKE DOCTOR'S ORDERS
TOO SERIOUSLY.

19:22.460 --> 19:24.130
WELL, MAYBE, BUT GET THIS.

19:24.190 --> 19:27.200
KRUSTY WAS ILLITERATE
AND THE GUY WHO ROBBED THE STORE

19:27.260 --> 19:29.900
WAS READING
THE <i>SPRINGFIELD REVIEW OF BOOKS.</i>

YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
ABLE TO READ

19:33.200 --> 19:35.970
TO ENJOY THE <i>SPRINGFIELD
REVIEW OF BOOKS.</i>

19:36.040 --> 19:37.510
JUST LOOK AT THESE
AMUSING CARICATURES

19:37.570 --> 19:39.710
OF GORE VIDAL
AND SUSAN SONTAG.

19:39.770 --> 19:42.570
YEAH, I GUESS
THOSE <i>ARE KIND OF FUNNY.</i>

19:42.640 --> 19:46.470
CHILDREN,
THIS WHOLE SORDID AFFAIR
HAS BEEN A SHOCK TO ALL OF US

19:46.550 --> 19:48.650
BUT WE MUST GET ON
WITH OUR LIVES.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.620
LET'S TRY TO REMEMBER KRUSTY
NOT AS A HARDENED CRIMINAL

19:51.690 --> 19:54.860
BUT AS THAT LOVABLE JESTER
WHO HONKED HIS HORN

19:54.920 --> 19:55.920
AND PUTTED AROUND
IN HIS LITTLE CAR.

19:55.990 --> 19:57.090
AND SHOT YOU
OUT OF A CANNON.

19:57.160 --> 19:58.760
AND SHOT ME OUT OF A CANNON.

19:58.830 --> 20:01.160
YES, WE WILL NEVER FORGET THAT.

20:01.230 --> 20:02.400
BART, OPEN YOUR HEART.

20:02.460 --> 20:05.260
I ADMIT, I HAVE SOME MIGHTY
BIG SHOES TO FILL

20:05.330 --> 20:15.470
( <i>echoing repeatedly )
BIG SHOES TO FILL..</i>

20:19.810 --> 20:20.740
...THERE WAS
A SCHOOL OF THOUGHT

20:20.820 --> 20:21.820
CALLED STOICISM...

20:21.880 --> 20:22.780
WAIT A MINUTE!

20:22.850 --> 20:23.950
YOU DID IT!

20:24.020 --> 20:26.320
( <i>children gasp )
EXCUSE ME?</i>

20:26.390 --> 20:27.690
ATTENTION, FELLOW CHILDREN!

20:27.760 --> 20:29.060
KRUSTY DIDN'T ROB
THAT STORE.

20:29.120 --> 20:31.820
SIDE-SHOW BOB FRAMED HIM
AND I GOT PROOF.

20:31.890 --> 20:33.390
OW! MY FOOT!

20:33.460 --> 20:36.730
YOU LOUSY,
STUPID, CLUMSY...

20:36.800 --> 20:38.970
SEE THAT?
KRUSTY WORE BIG FLOPPY SHOES

20:39.030 --> 20:41.330
BUT HE'S GOT LITTLE FEET,
LIKE ALL GOOD HEARTED PEOPLE.

20:41.400 --> 20:42.030
OW!

20:42.100 --> 20:43.600
BUT SIDE-SHOW BOB

20:43.670 --> 20:45.980
REALLY FILLS HIS
SHOES WITH BIG, UGLY FEET.

20:46.040 --> 20:47.410
KID'S RIGHT.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.650
HOW DO YOU FIGURE
WE MISSED THAT?

20:49.710 --> 20:52.450
GET OFF YOUR DUFFS BOYS,
AND DOWN TO THAT STUDIO.

20:52.510 --> 20:56.140
YES I ADMIT IT.
I HATED HIM.

20:56.220 --> 20:58.020
HIS HACKNEYED SHENANIGANS

20:58.090 --> 20:59.920
ROBBED ME OF MY DIGNITY
FOR YEARS.

20:59.990 --> 21:01.290
I PLAYED THE BUFFOON

21:01.360 --> 21:03.990
WHILE HE SQUANDERED A FORTUNE
ON HIS VULGAR APPETITES.

21:04.060 --> 21:06.700
THAT'S WHY I FRAMED KRUSTY.

21:06.760 --> 21:09.570
I WOULD'VE GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT
TOO IF IT WEREN'T FOR THESE
MEDDLING KIDS.

21:09.630 --> 21:11.800
TAKE HIM AWAY, BOYS.

21:11.870 --> 21:14.840
TREAT KIDS AS EQUALS--
THEY'RE PEOPLE, TOO!

21:14.900 --> 21:16.600
THEY'RE SMARTER THAN YOU THINK!

21:16.670 --> 21:19.810
THEY WERE SMART ENOUGH
TO CATCH ME!

21:24.580 --> 21:28.420
WELL, WE MADE A TERRIBLE,
TERRIBLE MISTAKE.

21:28.480 --> 21:31.310
UH... WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

21:31.390 --> 21:32.960
IT BETTER NOT,
YOU DIMWIT.

21:33.020 --> 21:35.430
KRUSTY, I'M MAN ENOUGH
TO ADMIT I WAS WRONG,

21:35.490 --> 21:37.890
AND I'M SORRY I FINGERED
YOU IN COURT.

21:37.960 --> 21:40.130
I SINCERELY HOPE
THE HORRIBLE STORIES I HEARD

21:40.190 --> 21:41.860
ABOUT WHAT GOES ON
IN PRISON ARE EXAGGERATED.

21:41.930 --> 21:43.470
THE IMPORTANT THING IS

21:43.530 --> 21:45.900
I REGAINED THE TRUST
OF THE CHILDREN.

21:45.970 --> 21:48.270
BUT THERE WAS ONE BOY
WHO TRUSTED ME ALL ALONG.

21:48.340 --> 21:49.140
BART?

21:49.200 --> 21:50.530
YES, SIR?

21:50.610 --> 21:51.840
THANK YOU.
