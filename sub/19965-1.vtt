00:46.960 --> 00:50.669
No, it's the latest craze
sweeping the Pennines.

00:50.760 --> 00:54.036
To be honest, l'd rather be
sweeping the Pennines right now.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.315
You're supposed to have
three weeks' training for this.

00:56.400 --> 00:58.356
Granada Reports don't have
that kind of money...

00:58.440 --> 01:01.955

launch myself off this mountain.

01:02.040 --> 01:06.636

Tony Wilson, for Granada Reports.

lf it stops flapping, l'm in trouble.

01:15.840 --> 01:17.592

This is a physical... high.

01:34.360 --> 01:36.999
A physical, legal high.

01:46.720 --> 01:50.235

better than sex.

You're, er, gonna be seeing a lot more
of that sort of thing in the film.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.397
All of that actually did happen.

03:01.480 --> 03:03.914
Obviously it's symbolic,
it works on both levels.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.514
l don't wanna tell you too much,
don't wanna spoil the film,...

03:06.600 --> 03:08.591

09:53.360 --> 09:57.069

from his holidays.

09:57.160 --> 09:59.196

09:59.280 --> 10:01.794
Rhyl. The Sun Centre in Rhyl.

10:04.560 --> 10:05.913
Right.

10:07.560 --> 10:08.959
Right.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.996
l would describe it as history.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.833
How could it be history?
There were only 42 people at the gig.

10:14.920 --> 10:17.309
What difference does that make?
How many were at the Last Supper?

10:17.400 --> 10:18.753
Er, 1 2.

10:18.840 --> 10:20.796
Well, er, 1 3 including Jesus.

- Hi, Tony. Have you recovered?
- lt's not historically documented.

10:24.080 --> 10:27.436

10:27.520 --> 10:31.559

all the music on television.

11:10.560 --> 11:12.710
And they didn't like punk.

11:12.800 --> 11:14.279

13:28.480 --> 13:30.835
We'll be hearing more
from the Happy Mondays later...

13:30.920 --> 13:34.515
..but right now l'm getting tired
of just putting bands on television...

13:34.600 --> 13:38.434
..so l'm about to open
a live-music venue.

13:38.520 --> 13:40.078
lt's, er...

13:40.160 --> 13:42.435
- lt's a bit of a dump, isn't it?
- Not Las Vegas, is it?

13:42.520 --> 13:46.035
- Go round to the left, Tony.
- Dog shite everywhere. Disgusting.

13:46.120 --> 13:49.556
Yeah, well, it's urban, it's exciting.
lt's exactly the place we should be.

13:49.640 --> 13:50.868
(dogs bark)

13:50.960 --> 13:53.155
You don't think those kids
will nick the car?

13:53.240 --> 13:56.471
- They're not gonna nick the car.
- Are you sure?

13:56.560 --> 13:59.120
- Right, the reason we're here...
- Margaret?

13:59.200 --> 14:02.112
Because of the explosion of music
with New Wave,...

14:02.200 --> 14:04.395
..there's lots of exciting
bands happening...

14:04.480 --> 14:07.278
..and l just think that, culturally,
Manchester's slightly lagging behind.

14:07.360 --> 14:10.670
Yeah, to get into a nightclub
you have to dress like a hairdresser.

14:10.760 --> 14:12.955
- Yeah.
- The wife's a hairdresser.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.553
Well, that's great...

14:14.640 --> 14:17.632
..but some people aren't, and they've
got a right to dance and party.

14:17.720 --> 14:20.075
- l'm Tonay.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.149
Sorry, this is Tony.

14:21.240 --> 14:24.038
Tonay doesn't believe in,
er, television.

14:24.120 --> 14:27.157
l was just saying, cos it's funny
cos, erm,... Tony's on the telly.

14:27.240 --> 14:30.596
You know what l call television?
The idiot box.

14:30.680 --> 14:33.194
- ldiot box.
- Yeah, there's a lot of rubbish on.

14:33.280 --> 14:35.032
We split the door 60/40 to me.

14:35.120 --> 14:37.873
The band, they get a crate of ale.
You can have Fridays. All right?

14:37.960 --> 14:39.951
- OK.
- Look round while l do the till.

14:40.040 --> 14:41.473
OK. Thank you.

14:41.560 --> 14:43.152
Linds. Come on.

14:46.560 --> 14:49.518
- lt stinks in here.
- Erm, there's a problem.

14:49.920 --> 14:52.115
You never told me he was called Tony.

14:52.200 --> 14:53.952
- Who?
- What's up?

14:54.040 --> 14:56.110
Tony. There's two Tonys.

14:56.200 --> 14:57.758
Yeah?

14:57.840 --> 15:01.310
Well, that... that... that...
Straightaway that's a... that's...

15:01.400 --> 15:03.709
Can you not see
how that's a potential problem?

15:03.800 --> 15:07.509
He's in charge of the club, l'm in
charge of whatever it is we're doing.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.955
There's two Tonys on equal pegging,
there's a confrontation.

15:10.040 --> 15:12.474
- Who's Tony one, who's Tony two?
- For fuck's sake, Tony.

15:12.560 --> 15:16.235
- We'll need some differentiation.
- Yeah, but he's not called Tony.

15:16.320 --> 15:19.630
He's called Tonay.
You know, Don... Tonay.

15:19.720 --> 15:21.756
lt's his fucking surname, Tone.

15:21.840 --> 15:23.592
- ls it?
- Yeah.

15:23.680 --> 15:25.238
lt's a bit grubby.

15:25.320 --> 15:27.914
Yeah, l know, but we can get it
cleaned up for the nights we're in.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.514
- Use your scrubbers to clean it up.
- That's worse.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.591
What is worse, Tony?

15:32.680 --> 15:34.398
Well...

15:34.480 --> 15:38.632
Sorry to harp on about this, but that
makes him Mr Tonay and l'm just Tony.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.676
- (laughs)
- What's wrong with that, Tony?

15:40.760 --> 15:43.672
Well, there's a hierarchy there
straightaway: Mister.

15:43.760 --> 15:46.035
Mr Tonay is more important than Tony.
''Hello, Mr Tonay.''

15:46.120 --> 15:49.237
''Yes, Mister. No, Mister.''
And plain old Tony. ''Tony, me mate.''

15:49.320 --> 15:51.117
l've got to have some credibility.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.589
Why don't you just call him Don?
How about that?

15:53.680 --> 15:56.035
See if he goes for that. Call him Don.

15:57.360 --> 15:59.510
- Don...
- We're trying to set up a club.

15:59.600 --> 16:02.512
- (dogs bark)
- What kind of music you bringing in?

16:02.600 --> 16:04.830
Erm, sort of, er,... New Wave.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.273
Kinda indie.

16:06.360 --> 16:07.918
- lndian?-
- No, indie.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.753
(spits) Don't want any of that.
Don't like that ska.

16:10.840 --> 16:12.592
- OK.
- Don't want any of that.

16:12.680 --> 16:15.069
A notion. l'll leave you with this:
heavy metal.

16:15.160 --> 16:18.914
Get one of them bands in here. They
drink like the fuckin' Queen Mother.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.070
- Leave you with that.
- Nice car, Don.

16:21.160 --> 16:23.799
- She's thirsty.
- See you, Don-

16:25.640 --> 16:28.598
- l think the name thing went OK.
- He heard you that time.

16:28.680 --> 16:30.636
- l was gonna be a don.
- (car horn)

16:30.720 --> 16:33.678
l was gonna be a Virgil till me mum
lost her bottle at the last minute.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.558
- No, he means he was gonna be a don.
- l went to Cambridge.

16:36.640 --> 16:39.029
What about a name for the club?

16:39.240 --> 16:43.199
Call it Factory.
l like that. Bit Andy Warhol.

16:43.280 --> 16:44.759
Bit LS Lowry.

16:44.840 --> 16:47.912
l just saw a sign on the wall,
said ''Factory closing'',...

16:48.000 --> 16:50.560
..and l thought we can have one
going ''Factory opening''.

17:08.880 --> 17:11.394
..and, as it goes, so it went.
lt's all over.

17:11.480 --> 17:14.438
lf you wanna hear good music
from now on, get off the couch...

17:14.520 --> 17:18.957
..and go down to the Factory night
at the Russell Club every Friday.

17:19.040 --> 17:21.429
Go forth and preach the gospel.
Good night.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.672
- Oh, fuck you.
- Why does he let people say that?

17:37.760 --> 17:41.594
He doesn't care what they say
as long as they're talkin' about him.

17:41.680 --> 17:43.033
You know that, Alan.

17:43.120 --> 17:45.236

Tony, l really miss your programme so
l thought, to get it back on telly...

17:56.440 --> 17:59.273
Oi, oi. He don't want it to come back.

17:59.360 --> 18:03.239
He wants it to be gone forever
so it can become a legend. Don't ya?

18:03.320 --> 18:06.392

There's your answer, sweetheart.

18:06.480 --> 18:09.278

- You can get me a pint.

This is the fucking gig.

23:58.320 --> 24:00.311

24:08.160 --> 24:10.116
Yeah, it's really nice.

24:10.200 --> 24:13.909
lt's beautiful. But useless.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.309
..''Nothing useless
can be truly beautiful.''

24:19.240 --> 24:20.912
- You know what?
- All right, Tone.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.399
Yeah.

24:22.480 --> 24:25.756
- Heather, this is Tony Wilson.
- All right, love.

24:25.840 --> 24:27.990
You seen Lindsay?

24:28.080 --> 24:30.116
She went off with Howard.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.194
She, er...

24:33.280 --> 24:37.193
She just caught me getting a blow job
off a hooker in the back of a van.

24:40.160 --> 24:42.628
Better go and get her.

24:46.400 --> 24:48.868

24:51.240 --> 24:53.435
(man and woman pant)

24:57.720 --> 24:58.869
(clears throat)

24:58.960 --> 25:00.313
Excuse me.

25:01.320 --> 25:02.753
(Lindsay moans)

25:02.840 --> 25:04.796
- Hi, Tony.
- Hi.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.955
Erm,... have you got the car keys?

25:09.680 --> 25:12.194
- ln me bag.
- Thanks.

25:12.280 --> 25:14.032
(moaning)

25:14.640 --> 25:17.393
l only got a blow job.
That's full penetration.

25:17.480 --> 25:20.552
- (louder moaning)
- See you, Howard.

25:20.640 --> 25:22.596
See ya, Tony.

25:23.520 --> 25:24.555
All right?

25:24.640 --> 25:26.710
(moaning)

25:26.800 --> 25:29.439
l definitely don't remember
this happening.

25:29.520 --> 25:32.034
This is the real Howard Devoto.

25:32.120 --> 25:35.157
He and Lindsay insisted we made clear
that this never happened.

25:35.240 --> 25:37.196
But l agree with John Ford.

25:37.280 --> 25:40.397
When you have to choose between
truth and legend, print the legend.

25:42.960 --> 25:44.757
l thought their name was Warsaw.

25:44.840 --> 25:48.196
You can't have a band called Warsaw.
You can't put that on a poster.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.555
People would think
it was a holiday advert.

25:50.640 --> 25:53.712
Joy Division:
do you know what that is, Mr Wilson?

25:53.800 --> 25:57.395
lt's when the Nazis, er,...
picked out racially pure women...

25:57.480 --> 25:58.799
..and, er, had sex with them.

25:58.880 --> 26:01.758
Yeah, well, Joy Division,
that's us, eh?

26:01.840 --> 26:04.115
- Well, it's a very Nazi name.
- So?

26:04.200 --> 26:06.668
Yeah, but it's quite... cheery,
as well.

26:06.760 --> 26:08.671
- You know: ''joy''.
- Yeah.

26:08.760 --> 26:11.149
Like a... division of joy
or something.

26:11.240 --> 26:13.310
- Joy.
- Joy... Division.

26:13.400 --> 26:15.675
Let's all say that together.
One, two, three...

26:15.760 --> 26:18.228
- Joy.
- Joy.

26:18.320 --> 26:20.675
Look at that flat-bottomed valley.

26:21.600 --> 26:24.398
lt wasn't always crazy
between me and Lindsay.

26:24.480 --> 26:26.835
Most days we werejust
another young couple,...

26:26.920 --> 26:29.480
..who wanted all the things
young couples want.

26:29.560 --> 26:32.393
Nice house, nice car
and a couple ofkids.

26:32.480 --> 26:35.711
Enjoy the walk,
cos it's just you and me.

26:37.360 --> 26:40.238
Would you like a little Tony
and a little Lindsay walking around?

26:40.320 --> 26:42.550
No, it'd be a nightmare.

26:42.640 --> 26:44.039
- l like to be free.
- OK.

26:44.120 --> 26:46.998
OK. All right, that's the last...
last word l'll say on the subject.

26:47.080 --> 26:50.152
Two words: body clock.
OK? Body clock.

26:50.240 --> 26:52.595
- How are you doing?
- All right?

26:52.680 --> 26:55.353
- Hello, l'm here.
- All right, Tone?

26:55.440 --> 26:57.396
That's us. That's us.

26:58.440 --> 27:02.149
The majors are the status quo
and we're not, we're the anarchists.

27:02.240 --> 27:05.437
lt's gonna be like a co-op,
we're all gonna share in the proceeds.

27:05.520 --> 27:08.080
We pay for the costs and everything
and the rest of it is 50/50.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.515
50 Factory,
50 per cent goes to the artist.

27:10.600 --> 27:12.556
Alan's gonna be
head of business affairs.

27:12.640 --> 27:14.995
lt's Red Leb, that.
Have you smelt it? Smell that.

27:15.080 --> 27:16.308
Smell that.

27:16.400 --> 27:19.517
l'm giving you total creative freedom.
Right?

27:19.600 --> 27:20.874
lt's dead fucking simple.

27:20.960 --> 27:23.076
You don't like us, you fuck off.
l don't like you, l fuck off.

27:23.160 --> 27:26.391
l'll write you a contract saying
there's no contract in me own blood.

27:26.480 --> 27:28.914
- l'll do it if you want.
- Not in his own blood-

27:29.000 --> 27:30.638
- Here you are.
- l'll do it.

27:30.720 --> 27:32.995
- You write it... in your own blood.
- No, don't give him the dirty knife.

27:33.080 --> 27:36.436

the great prophet, ''l dares do owt.''

27:36.520 --> 27:39.398

- Come on.

27:39.480 --> 27:42.313
- Oh, he's done it, he's done it-
- There you go. Real blood.

27:42.400 --> 27:43.879
''l...''

27:44.960 --> 27:46.712
''..Tony...''

27:47.240 --> 27:49.196
How can you read that?

27:49.280 --> 27:51.236
l'm not sure that'd stand up in court-

27:51.320 --> 27:53.595
What more do you want? He's written
the contract in his own blood-

28:08.080 --> 28:09.832
Martin?-

28:10.520 --> 28:12.272
What you doing?-

28:12.360 --> 28:14.316
(coughs) Recording...

28:14.840 --> 28:16.193
..silence.

28:17.080 --> 28:19.196
You're recording silence?-

28:21.120 --> 28:23.475
Now l'm recording Tony fucking Wilson.

28:26.160 --> 28:28.799
Erm, we want you
to produce a band for us.

28:29.920 --> 28:30.955
Who's us?

28:31.040 --> 28:32.837
Er, Factory Records.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.990
Right, 50 quid an hour.

28:35.080 --> 28:38.072
Plus l wanna be
a partner in the company.

28:38.160 --> 28:40.116

- See ya.

28:50.440 --> 28:53.876
Stop, stop, stop. Stop that
horrible fucking racket, please.

28:53.960 --> 28:55.951
What's wrong with it?

28:56.040 --> 28:57.678
Nothing was wrong
with the drumming as such,...

28:57.760 --> 28:59.830
..it's just that, erm,...

29:00.640 --> 29:03.438
..people have been playing like that
for about... 20,000 years...

29:03.520 --> 29:06.273
..and quite frankly, erm,...
it's boring the arse off me.

29:06.360 --> 29:10.319
Now, let's just try something...
a lot simpler, OK?

29:10.880 --> 29:13.599
Faster but slower.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.956
There's logic there somewhere.

29:16.040 --> 29:17.996
- (drumming)
- l know what he means.

29:27.160 --> 29:29.993
Right, stop.
We got... We got a rattle.

29:30.080 --> 29:32.116

the whole fucking kit.

29:32.200 --> 29:33.838

29:33.920 --> 29:35.751
How long's that gonna fucking take?

29:35.840 --> 29:38.832

29:43.000 --> 29:44.718
We're still workin', aren't we?

29:49.480 --> 29:51.516
What l'd like...

29:51.800 --> 29:54.189
..is to rebuild it on the roof.

29:55.640 --> 29:57.358
On the roof?

29:57.440 --> 29:59.556
- Yeah.
- On the actual roof of the studio?

30:05.120 --> 30:07.031
Bloody hell.

30:07.120 --> 30:09.270

30:14.200 --> 30:18.239

31:36.720 --> 31:39.871
ln All The Young Dudes he sings about
how you should die when you're 25.

31:39.960 --> 31:41.473
Do you know how old he is?

31:41.560 --> 31:43.676
He's 30, 29, something.
He's a liar.

31:43.760 --> 31:44.715
Look, it doesn't matter.

31:44.800 --> 31:47.030
A lot of great artists produce
their best work when they're... older.

31:47.120 --> 31:49.395
- You know, WB Yeats...
- l've never heard of him, mate.

31:49.480 --> 31:53.029
Yeats is the greatest poet since
Dante. lf he'd have died at 25...

31:53.120 --> 31:54.917
- l would have heard of him, Tony.
- Hang on.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.036

31:58.120 --> 31:59.314

32:10.560 --> 32:11.834
- You like it?
- l do.

32:11.920 --> 32:13.194

32:32.440 --> 32:34.795

They're like fucking milk bottles.

the charge that you're a fascist?

37:29.960 --> 37:30.756
What?

37:30.840 --> 37:32.717
Your band, Joy Division,

..captured by the SS for the breeding
of perfect Aryans. lsn't that sick?

37:36.080 --> 37:38.435

- Can't do it that well. Go on, then.
- Go left-

40:00.760 --> 40:04.309
Stick to what you're good at.
Unless you're a duck, then branch out.

lf you listen to lan's music

obviously,...

50:27.680 --> 50:28.874
..but, er,...

50:28.960 --> 50:32.191

50:32.280 --> 50:34.430
..''American lives

51:22.200 --> 51:25.317

is like a double helix, OK?

51:25.400 --> 51:27.356
That's two waves that intertwine.

51:27.440 --> 51:30.989
So one wave... goes like this,...
the other one goes like that,...

51:31.080 --> 51:33.389

51:33.480 --> 51:35.436

in the descendant,...

51:40.480 --> 51:41.754
..another one is in the ascendant.

51:41.840 --> 51:45.435

a crisscross, a kind of a hiatus,...

..but the two guys that are gonna be
on the crest of the next wave...

51:47.920 --> 51:50.480
..are Paul and Shaun Ryder.

51:52.360 --> 51:54.954

which, remember, works on two levels.

54:31.240 --> 54:32.912
Everyone wanted to play.:

54:33.000 --> 54:35.389
..Bowie, Queen, the Stones.

54:35.480 --> 54:38.597
l chose A Certain Ratio
because they were my band.

ofthe Hacienda.

54:40.720 --> 54:44.156

- No, let me tell you, right.

of the untalented.

far more than anyone listening to 'em.

Every great band
needs its own special chemistry...

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:12.356
..and Bez was a great chemist.

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:16.228
Could l offer anybody, like, the best
drug experience they've ever had?

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:19.673

ofthe Bands at the Hacienda.

that indie guitar sound,...

''whacka-whacka'' wah-wah thing.

- Yeah.
- lt's soulful and it's rocky.

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:06.715

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:22.471

# Said ''l'm looking for
something better''

# And he made
his shock announcement

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:49.559
4,000 years ago, the Egyptians built
the very first canal.

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:52.438
# ..backed down, backed off

01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:57.793
The first canal in Britain
was built by the Romans:

01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:59.313
..the Fosse Dyke in Lincoln.

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:02.790
# He said ''l'm wealthy enough
not to do this no more''

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.677
# And he made it all known

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:07.752
This is the Rochdale Canal,
built in 1804,...

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:10.308
..when Manchester was the greatest
industrial city in the world.

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.470
# ..palm out

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:17.998
# And she said
''Don't know if l should''

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:23.598
And their neglect mirrors the decline
of post-war industrial Britain.

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:26.240
# ..at first it was a yes

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:29.756
# And then a no, then yes #

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.954
Suddenly, everything came together.:

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.359
..the music, the dancing,...

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.829
..the drugs, the venue, the city.

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:47.198
l was proved right.: Manchester
was like Renaissance Florence.

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:49.953
Mike Pickering was right.:
you don't need bands in a club.

01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:52.315
Shaun Ryder was right.
New Order were right.

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:54.709
We all came together.

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.756

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:01.550
No, l think cocaine's a suit's drug,
it's a destroyer of talent.

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:02.595
No, thank you.

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:04.557
We haven't got any fuckin' talent.
Roe, chop one out.

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:06.870
- That's why it's fine for you.
- Come on, Tony-

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:10.193
- You're a very giving person, sir.
- Come on, Tone.

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:11.315
One of us-

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:27.155
Never judge a book by its cover.
You've got a nice cover, by the way.

01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:28.832
First edition, very collectable.

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:30.035
- (laughs) Thank you.
- Hi, Tony-

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:32.031
- Hello, love. All right?
- Yeah.

01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:35.157
This is Yvette.
She's actually Miss United Kingdom,...

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:37.196
..but that's not
what attracted me to her.

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:41.831
..where they do Stars ln Their Eyes,
erm, interiors of Coronation Street.

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:43.831
- Hello, love. You all right?
- Hi, Tony.

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.990
- Nice to see you.
- And you, as ever.

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:48.275
- And what do you do?
- How do you mean?

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:50.954
Well... You know, your job,... here.

01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:53.110
Well, l'm... l'm Tony Wilson.

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:56.919
- lt's a bit chilly.
- Pop this... Have this.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.877
- Put that on.
- Oh, thank you.

01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:00.791
You can keep it. lt's cashmere.

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:03.758

- Course. Least l can do for Miss UK.

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:06.149
l haven't got a tiara so you'll have
to make do with that, sweetheart.

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:08.834
So, l mean, Granada really
is just sort of my hobby.

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:11.195
Erm, my proper job...
Have you heard of the Happy Mondays?

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:13.032
- Yeah, l love 'em.
- l look after them. Factory Records.

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.680
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's my... my label.

01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:17.796
- Er,... New Order? Heard of them?
- Yeah.

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:20.030
Sometimes see them at the Hacienda.
Do you know the Hacienda?

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:21.553
lt's fantastic, yeah.

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:22.868
- l own that nightclub.
- Really?-

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:25.520
Part-owner. lf you ever want
reduced admission, come and see me.

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.750
Better still, you get in free
if you escort me.

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:29.398
- (laughs) OK.
- l'm flirting, by the way.

01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:30.833
You are, yes.

01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:32.592
- lt's that obvious?
- (laughs)

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:35.672
Don't judge. Piety is
a very unattractive quality.

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:37.637
Flirting is a very natural process,...

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:39.676
..she's aware of it,
l'm being postmodern,...

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:41.910
..before it was fashionable.

01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:48.589
- 'Ey up, Tony.
- Hi.

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:16.875
Being at the Hacienda was like
being at the French Revolution.

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:19.918
Bliss it was that dawn to be alive.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.355
But to be young was very heaven.

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:28.993
OK, so l was nearly 40,
which isn't really young,...

01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:31.036
..but these days
it isn't that old either...

01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:33.873

l knew then that choosing Nathan
as the new manager ofthe Mondays...

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:54.440
..was not necessarily a good idea.

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:56.829
Nathan's gonna be our new manager.

01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:59.388
- l'm gonna look after them.
- And he does it very well.

01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:02.313

so l indulged him.

lt's an adventure. lt's the Magical

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:54.798
lt's like Scooby Doo, innit?
Cos they had a bus, didn't they?

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:56.598
lt is a little bit like Scooby Doo.

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:01.239
Manchester became
the centre ofthe universe.:

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:03.356
..the best drugs, the best clothes,...

01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:05.590
..the best women, the best music,...

..the best bands, the best club.

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:11.997
Suddenly everyone wanted
to be from Manchester...

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:15.072

everyone wanted a part ofyou.

for a wabosh, mate? Come on.

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:19.751

- l'm the big guy.
- He's the big boss.

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:27.678
- Oh, yeah?
- Well, metaphorically speaking.

01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:30.720
lt was like being on
a fantastic fairground ride,...

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:33.758
..centrifugal forces
throwing us wider and wider,...

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:37.116
..and it's all right because there's
a brilliant machine at the centre...

01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:38.633
..to bring us back to earth.

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:41.712
That was Manchester.
That was the Hacienda.

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.956
Now, imagine the machine breaks.

01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:46.395
For a while it's even better
because you're really flying...

01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:48.471
..but then... you're fucked...

01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:50.790
..because nobody beats gravity.

01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:54.033
# You take ten feet back

# So sack all the needy

l went to interview Sir Keith Joseph.

01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:06.554
lt's very important.
He likes to be called Sir Keith.

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.039
His knighthood's important to him.

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:12.038
They call him the Mad Monk. That's
important at the end of the story.

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:13.348
# l had to crucify somebody today

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:16.000

01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:17.513
But l didn't, l drove. OK?

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:19.636
So l'm driving along,
driving really well,...

01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:23.952
..er, and l end up
on this fucking Pennine.

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:26.960
There you go: a mobile phone.
Do you know how to work one?

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:28.792
Yeah. l've used 'em before.

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:31.474
And l... l make a phone call
on this mobile-phone thing.

01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:35.877
lt's like listening to
a fucking headache.

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:43.319
And then...
l was walking along a railway line...

01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:45.709
..and a train goes roaring past.

01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:50.477
And l climbed... onto the train.

Hi. Sir Keith Joseph,
my humble apologies.

Er, Saint Anthony. Yes, er...

01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:52.435
He was a monk, funnily enough.

Timing is everything.

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:48.754
When we built the Hacienda,
it was too soon.

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:51.479
When we built the Factory office,
it was too late.

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:55.189
lt did, however, have a zinc roof,
which was very, very cool.

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:58.158
Even though you could only see it
ifyou were in a helicopter.

01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:03.078

a proper office.

How much was it?

- lt's not the materials, Hooky,...
- That's brilliant.

01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:19.116
..you're paying for design.

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:22.237
Er, l didn't ask about the material,
l asked how much it was.

01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:24.197
lt was 30 grand... but, er...

For God's sake-

01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:07.994
There was a problem with the Hacienda.
lt never made any money.

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:11.152
There were huge crowds
and a great atmosphere...

01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:13.470
..but it was all fuelled by ecstasy,
not alcohol.

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:15.912
And we didn't sell E at the bar.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.991
Although we did talk about it.

01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:19.911
We were spending money
on the building,...

..the staff, the DJs,
the sound system...

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:26.038
..but most ofthe money
went to the drug dealers.

01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:29.078
And guess what?
They didn't give the money to us.

01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:32.675
They spent it on clothes, or cars,
or restaurants, or houses,...

01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:34.716
..or girls, or guns.

01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:37.436

01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:58.590
Drug dealers are like
any other businessmen.

their market share.

but it's also bad for business.

a gun it's hard to turn them away,...

for drugs instead.

When the cash ran out,
the stole the recording gear,...

why don't we, erm, eat that?

01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:01.357
Absolutely.
Yvette, do you wanna do the honours?

01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:03.396
Terry, have you met Tony?

01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:05.471
- Yeah, we said hello.
- OK, fine.

01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:07.516
- (# Sunshine And Love)
- What's the tune called?

01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:08.749
Nice to meet you.

01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:11.593
We're gonna do a cover
of Silence is Golden.

01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:14.196
Terry, Terry.

01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:16.510
- Turn it up-
- This is brilliant.

01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:18.636
- Turn it up-
- Turn it up-

01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:20.472
l like that-

01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:27.396
- This is... That...
- (music stops)

01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:29.630
- l was really into that.
- Play some more-

01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:31.472
Let's hear some lyrics.

01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:34.393
You'll hear the vocals, Roger,
when we hear the offer.

01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:36.436
That's the way we do things
at Factory.

01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:37.953
Shaun, where you going?

01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:40.838
l'm not eating fuckin' bunny rabbit
food, l'm going for a Kentucky.

01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:43.070
- Are you coming?
- See you later.

01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:45.151
- We'll get you a Kentucky.
- See you later, Tone.

01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:47.390
All right, mate, see you later.

01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:49.596
Yvette? Just keep an eye on them.

01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:53.673
So, Tony, why don't we listen
to the tune while they're out?

01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:55.633
Erm...

01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:57.996
Hey, Tony, come on.

01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:01.629
l do understand that Shaun can be....
a bit of a handful.

01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:06.477
Mm, yeah. He's a genius, though.

01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:08.950
Yeah, you're right, he is a genius.

01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:12.032
And l've got to say,
if l owned a record label,...

01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:14.270
..and l had signed Shaun to it,...

01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:18.239
..then l would not be selling him on
for a fee.

01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:21.357
(makes chicken noises)

01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:25.118
l'm going to make you an offer.
Can l lean on this?

01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:27.555
Erm, yes. You've got to be a bit...
lt's fine.

01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:30.632
l'm gonna make you an offer
for the whole company.

01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:32.233
OK.

01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:36.231
Five million.

01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:38.276
What do you want for that?

01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:40.316
- What do l want?
- Yeah.

01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:42.356
l want everything.

01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:47.514
l want everything: the back catalogue,
this table, this food, these windows.

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:49.431
- OK.
- You want Factory?

01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:50.953
Quite right.

01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:54.794
(clears throat) OK.
We're very, very flattered, Roger,...

01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:58.111
..terribly flattered that you think
we're worth such a princely sum,...

01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:02.159
..however, what you're...
what l have to explain to you is...

01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:04.800
..Factory Records
are not actually a company.

01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:07.314
We are an experiment
in human nature.

01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:10.551
You're labouring
under the misapprehension...

01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:13.791
..that we actually have... a deal...

01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:16.989
..with, er,... with our bands,...

01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:20.117
..that we have any kind of a contract
at all.

01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:22.794
And l'm afraid we... we don't.

01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:26.960
Because that's the sum total
of the paperwork...

01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:31.716
..to do with Factory Records' deal
with their various bands.

01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:36.157
''The artists own all their own work,
the label owns nothing.''

01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:38.674
''Our bands have the freedom.''

01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:40.716
''To fuck off.''

01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:42.756
Oh, yeah. Quite right.

01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:44.956
''..the freedom to fuck off.''

01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:48.798
(chuckles)
l don't have to deal with you at all.

01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:53.032
Correct.
But my epitaph will be...

01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:57.079
..that l... never literally
nor metaphorically...

01:39:57.800 --> 01:39:59.756
..sold out.

01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:02.593
l protected myself
from ever having to have the...

01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:04.636
..dilemma of having to sell out...

01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:07.359
..by having nothing to sell out.

01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:11.636
(clears throat)

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:14.956
Tony, you're fucking mad.

01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:16.996
That's a point of view.

01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:30.870
..the crumbling warehouses,
the railway arches,...

01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:33.155
..the cheap, abundant drugs.

01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:35.196
That's what did it in the end.:

01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:38.636
..not the money, not the music,
not even the guns.

01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:42.952

my excess ofcivic pride.

(Tony) Ryan-

01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:51.073
Tony Wilson, is it true
the Hacienda is closing down?

01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:52.115
Yes, it is.

01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:54.156
How does it feel
now it's fucked up in your face?

01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:57.232
Glorious. The Hacienda is dead,
it will never grow old.

of little baby dandelions,...

01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:34.792
