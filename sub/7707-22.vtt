WEBVTT

00:07.942 --> 00:11.243
Hey, ALF.
What are you doing?

00:11.245 --> 00:14.780
Tying a slip knot.
But I can't get it to not slip.

00:15.883 --> 00:18.317
Say, that's not
my good string, is it?

00:18.319 --> 00:21.320
Willie, if you have good string

00:21.322 --> 00:23.055
you've got to get out more.

00:24.258 --> 00:26.825
Brian?
It's 10 to 7:00.

00:26.827 --> 00:28.627
We're gonna be late
for the scout meeting.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.562
(Brian)
'Coming, dad.'

00:34.735 --> 00:37.536
Don't tell me, Willie,
you made a few calls

00:37.538 --> 00:40.572
and got him
into the National Guard.

00:40.574 --> 00:41.940
Must you make that joke

00:41.942 --> 00:46.478
every time you see Brian
in his uniform?

00:46.480 --> 00:49.515
Yes. Next question.

00:49.517 --> 00:53.218
Well, I think you look great, B.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.820
Thanks, dad.

00:54.822 --> 00:58.590
Seeing you in that uniform
really takes me back.

00:58.592 --> 01:01.693
Obviously not back far enough.

01:01.695 --> 01:05.130
Back to my old days
as a Badger Scout.

01:05.132 --> 01:07.099
You were a Badger Scout?

01:07.101 --> 01:09.568
I mean you went outside
and everything?

01:10.938 --> 01:14.873
There has been more to my life
than going to work, you know.

01:14.875 --> 01:19.812
I know. You also take off your
glasses and rub your nose a lot.

01:21.015 --> 01:23.048
I was a Badger Scout
for four years.

01:23.050 --> 01:24.183
I earned 11 badges

01:24.185 --> 01:26.752
and I received an award
in fire prevention

01:26.754 --> 01:29.021
which has proven<i> far</i> more useful

01:29.023 --> 01:31.590
than I ever would
have<i> dreamed</i> possible.

01:33.694 --> 01:36.662
Brian, let's go.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.632
These aren't very
good knots, ALF.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.568
Stop badgering me..

01:42.570 --> 01:44.470
...you little badger.

01:44.472 --> 01:45.571
Come on. Come on, B,
we're late.

01:45.573 --> 01:47.005
- Bye, ALF.
- Bye.

01:47.007 --> 01:48.941
Oh! Oh.

01:48.943 --> 01:50.042
Car keys.

01:53.180 --> 01:54.713
Sheepshank.

01:56.550 --> 01:59.751
[theme music]

02:19.707 --> 02:21.907
[music continues]

02:35.222 --> 02:37.022
[music continues]

03:03.984 --> 03:05.484
I don't get it, Kate.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.419
I'm here during the day.

03:07.421 --> 03:10.022
Well, I know, ALF, but I-I still
think that a daycare center

03:10.024 --> 03:13.025
would be best for the baby
when I go back to work.

03:13.027 --> 03:14.893
Are you saying
you'd rather trust your child

03:14.895 --> 03:17.863
to total strangers than to me?

03:17.865 --> 03:21.433
Well, not-not to hurt
your feelings, ALF, but..

03:21.435 --> 03:23.068
...oh, yeah.

03:24.972 --> 03:27.873
Mom, you majored in art history
in college, didn't you?

03:27.875 --> 03:30.375
- Mm-hm.
- Did you like it?

03:30.377 --> 03:32.110
Oh, very much. Why?

03:32.112 --> 03:34.379
I'm trying to pick
my courses for next year

03:34.381 --> 03:35.981
but I don't know
which courses to pick

03:35.983 --> 03:38.650
because I haven't decided on
what I'm gonna major in.

03:38.652 --> 03:40.319
Forget college.

03:40.321 --> 03:41.954
Enter the fast-paced world

03:41.956 --> 03:44.156
of medical
and dental assistantry.

03:44.158 --> 03:45.791
You can keep your present job

03:45.793 --> 03:47.793
and train at night.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.863
Honey, wha-what do you think
you might be interested in?

03:51.865 --> 03:55.067
You may be eligible
for veteran's training benefits.

03:56.704 --> 03:59.004
Will you be quiet?

03:59.006 --> 04:01.506
But I haven't told you
what the operators are doing.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.842
- ALF.
- They're standing by.

04:05.980 --> 04:08.380
Then there was this time
we were digging a latrine

04:08.382 --> 04:10.382
out behind the patrol tent..

04:10.384 --> 04:12.884
...and out of nowhere
this big skunk

04:12.886 --> 04:14.686
comes in and sprayed everybody.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.922
You wouldn't believe
the stench!

04:16.924 --> 04:19.658
Could this wait
until I finish my popcorn..

04:19.660 --> 04:22.494
...and get my own apartment?

04:22.496 --> 04:26.331
No, I'm passing along
my campfire memories

04:26.333 --> 04:29.468
to Badger Brian,
if you don't mind.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.236
How'd your scout
meeting go, Bri?

04:31.238 --> 04:32.804
- Okay.
- Okay?

04:32.806 --> 04:35.307
It was fantastic.

04:35.309 --> 04:36.775
Brian here is gonna go

04:36.777 --> 04:39.044
on his first overnight
next Saturday.

04:39.046 --> 04:41.680
Oh, that's great, Bri!

04:41.682 --> 04:43.181
Yeah, real great.

04:43.183 --> 04:44.950
Now we have to listen a week

04:44.952 --> 04:46.885
of the adventures
of Willie Crockett

04:46.887 --> 04:49.454
king of the wild front lawn.

04:50.958 --> 04:54.026
Well, it's obvious
you've never experienced

04:54.028 --> 04:56.161
the joys of roughing it.

04:56.163 --> 04:59.431
So sue me.
I'm a couch alien.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.667
I'm going to change.

05:01.669 --> 05:04.469
Brian's gonna love communing
with nature. I know I did.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.471
Falling asleep under the stars

05:06.473 --> 05:08.173
the cool ground beneath you

05:08.175 --> 05:10.842
warming your hands
by an open fire.

05:10.844 --> 05:13.111
What were you,
a Badger Scout or a wino?

05:15.482 --> 05:19.151
Must you discourage
everything I do?

05:19.853 --> 05:22.287
Yes. Next question.

05:23.791 --> 05:26.792
[instrumental music]

05:29.563 --> 05:31.463
Sleeping bag?

05:31.465 --> 05:32.698
Yeah.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.166
Poncho?

05:34.168 --> 05:35.267
Yeah.

05:35.269 --> 05:36.501
Mess kit?

05:36.503 --> 05:38.203
It's in the closet.

05:38.205 --> 05:39.838
I'll get it.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.414
- 'Brian?'
- What?

05:49.416 --> 05:50.882
'What's a mess kit?'

05:50.884 --> 05:53.585
It's got a knife
and a fork and some pans.

05:53.587 --> 05:56.021
I got it.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.523
Why don't you pack
some important stuff?

05:58.525 --> 06:02.060
Like tacoroni?

06:02.062 --> 06:04.963
I don't care.
Pack whatever you want.

06:04.965 --> 06:08.266
I sense a growing disenchantment
with this venture.

06:08.268 --> 06:09.434
Huh?

06:09.436 --> 06:11.636
How come you don't want
to go camping?

06:11.638 --> 06:13.338
I wanna go camping.

06:13.340 --> 06:16.575
Right, and Joan of Arc
wanted to go to the barbeque.

06:18.278 --> 06:19.745
What gives?

06:19.747 --> 06:21.546
Can you keep a secret?

06:21.548 --> 06:25.951
No, but there's a first time
for everything.

06:25.953 --> 06:29.521
I'm scared to.
It's gonna be dark out there.

06:29.523 --> 06:31.123
Oh, yeah.

06:31.125 --> 06:33.825
But there'll be lots
of other kids around.

06:33.827 --> 06:37.028
That's even worse.
They'll think I'm a baby.

06:37.030 --> 06:39.631
Well, just tell Willie then.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.133
He'll take off his glasses

06:41.135 --> 06:45.003
rub his nose and tell you
you don't have to go.

06:45.005 --> 06:47.806
I know.
But he loves camping.

06:47.808 --> 06:51.676
He'll be real disappointed if
he finds out I don't wanna go.

06:51.678 --> 06:53.245
Where don't you wanna go?

06:53.247 --> 06:55.781
Camping with the Badger Scouts.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.115
Bright boy.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.184
Tell him there's no reason
to be scared.

06:59.186 --> 07:01.253
That was a secret, ALF.

07:01.255 --> 07:05.123
So revoke my security clearance.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.625
You know, I never went
camping myself

07:06.627 --> 07:08.326
but, uh, back in New York

07:08.328 --> 07:10.562
I heard about
this one scout troop.

07:10.564 --> 07:11.696
They camped in Central Park

07:11.698 --> 07:14.933
and were never heard from again.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.535
[laughing]

07:17.638 --> 07:19.604
Thanks a lot.

07:19.606 --> 07:24.743
Brian, the only thing you have
to fear is fear itself.

07:24.745 --> 07:28.180
Or a very Brady anything.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.450
What do you mean?

07:31.452 --> 07:34.052
Why don't we camp out
in the backyard tomorrow night?

07:34.054 --> 07:38.023
I'll show you that it's not
scary. Just boring.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.491
I don't know.

07:39.493 --> 07:42.027
We'll stay up
as late as we want.

07:42.029 --> 07:44.529
Go to bed without
brushing our teeth.

07:44.531 --> 07:48.500
Eat hot dogs until we're
10% meat by-products.

07:49.736 --> 07:50.936
Yeah.

07:50.938 --> 07:53.839
Come on, B. Live a little.

07:53.841 --> 07:55.674
You can come too, Jake.

07:55.676 --> 07:58.109
No, thanks. I got a life.

07:58.111 --> 07:59.711
Might be fun.

07:59.713 --> 08:01.313
Sleeping outside.

08:01.949 --> 08:03.215
I like ceilings.

08:04.051 --> 08:06.251
Breathing clean, fresh air.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.687
In Los Angeles?

08:10.023 --> 08:12.958
Being right under Lynn's window?

08:14.061 --> 08:15.961
What do you want
I should bring?

08:20.667 --> 08:22.467
You know, it's funny.

08:22.469 --> 08:24.970
I got the impression that Brian
wasn't all that enthusiastic

08:24.972 --> 08:26.638
about camping out,
and now he can't even wait

08:26.640 --> 08:27.873
for his scout trip.

08:27.875 --> 08:30.108
Oh, he's got the Tanner zest
for adventure

08:30.110 --> 08:32.744
that's for sure.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.679
You know, I can't believe
he's actually old enough

08:34.681 --> 08:36.214
to be camping out.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.783
It seems like only yesterday
he wasn't old enough

08:38.785 --> 08:40.652
to be camping out.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.087
Now he's a little man, alright.

08:42.089 --> 08:44.589
Oh, I almost forgot
his gummy worms.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.694
Well, I think
I finally figured out

08:49.696 --> 08:51.363
which courses
I should register for.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.331
Oh, did you choose a major?

08:53.333 --> 08:55.367
I was thinking
about art history.

08:55.369 --> 08:57.302
Oh, honey.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.704
I-I mean it's admirable that
you're interested in art

08:59.706 --> 09:02.641
but do you think that's really
a practical thing to major in?

09:02.643 --> 09:03.909
What do you mean?

09:03.911 --> 09:05.777
Well, we have a saying
in college

09:05.779 --> 09:07.345
those who can do

09:07.347 --> 09:09.614
and those who can't major
in art history.

09:09.616 --> 09:11.349
[laughing]

09:14.922 --> 09:16.388
I majored in art history.

09:16.390 --> 09:19.624
You were the exception, dear.
We never laughed at you.

09:19.626 --> 09:20.759
I suppose that studying

09:20.761 --> 09:22.694
mankind's greatest
artistic achievements

09:22.696 --> 09:26.398
wasn't nearly as interesting as
drawing population pie charts

09:26.400 --> 09:28.233
like you social science majors--

09:28.235 --> 09:31.536
I never drew a pie chart
in my life.

09:31.538 --> 09:35.073
Oh, okay, okay,
once I drew a pie chart

09:35.075 --> 09:36.741
and you know what?

09:37.644 --> 09:39.311
It wasn't bad.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.913
And where's that
pie chart today?

09:41.915 --> 09:43.949
I'll tell you where it's not.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.350
It's not in the Louvre.

09:46.954 --> 09:49.054
Uh, that reminds me, hon, um..

09:49.056 --> 09:51.289
...we're having a pool
at the office.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.258
What year did Van Gogh die?

09:53.260 --> 09:55.727
The year they asked him
to draw a pie chart.

10:00.901 --> 10:04.102
[instrumental music]

10:06.907 --> 10:08.707
Well, it's not too scary yet.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.077
Wait until it gets dark..

10:12.079 --> 10:15.180
...and the moon
moves behind a cloud..

10:15.182 --> 10:16.848
...and the fog rolls in.

10:16.850 --> 10:19.317
[laughing]

10:19.319 --> 10:21.152
I'm going back in the house.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.521
Wait. Relax. Relax.

10:23.523 --> 10:24.990
There's nothing there
in the dark

10:24.992 --> 10:26.958
that's not there
in the light..

10:26.960 --> 10:28.560
...except bats.

10:30.664 --> 10:33.465
[groaning]

10:38.438 --> 10:40.105
What do you have in here, ALF?

10:40.107 --> 10:42.240
Just a few carry-on items.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.675
They'll fit in the overhead bin

10:43.677 --> 10:45.877
or under the seat
in front of me.

10:45.879 --> 10:48.980
I thought we agreed
to only bring along the basics.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.515
I did.

10:50.517 --> 10:52.851
- Let's see.
- Hey, you got a search warrant?

10:56.023 --> 10:57.355
[sighing]

11:01.228 --> 11:02.727
"Meatballs?"

11:04.831 --> 11:06.297
"The Great Outdoors?"

11:07.134 --> 11:09.200
"Ernest Goes To Camp?"

11:09.202 --> 11:12.437
It's the wilderness trilogy.

11:12.439 --> 11:15.040
What are we supposed
to do with these?

11:15.042 --> 11:17.242
You didn't bring the VCR?

11:18.111 --> 11:21.012
Hey! Those are rentals.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.480
What else have you got in here?

11:22.482 --> 11:23.815
(ALF)
'Nothing.'

11:26.486 --> 11:27.552
Frappes.

11:28.689 --> 11:30.355
No Frappes.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.293
Cheez Whiz?

11:35.762 --> 11:37.228
Meat Whiz?

11:38.198 --> 11:39.764
Fish Whiz?

11:39.766 --> 11:42.834
Hey, we need something from each
of the major Whiz groups.

11:44.337 --> 11:47.205
Come on, Brian.
Help me pack this junk up.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.207
- Traitor.
- He's right, ALF.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.943
We have to go
by the Badger handbook.

11:51.945 --> 11:54.279
Ugh. No Cheez Whiz?

11:54.881 --> 11:56.648
No Frappes?

11:56.650 --> 11:58.083
No VCR?

11:58.085 --> 12:00.585
What's the point
of going camping?

12:00.587 --> 12:03.354
That is the point
of going camping.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.690
I thought that was the point
of going to prison.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.527
Look, ALF, this was your idea.

12:09.529 --> 12:13.164
Now, if we're going to do it,
we're gonna do it right, okay?

12:13.166 --> 12:15.033
Oh, alright.

12:15.035 --> 12:17.135
[telephone ringing]

12:17.137 --> 12:19.037
- What is that, ALF?
- Nothing.

12:19.039 --> 12:21.239
[ringing continues]

12:22.809 --> 12:24.242
Hello?

12:24.244 --> 12:27.078
No, cancel the pizza.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.880
We're going to die.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.283

12:45.365 --> 12:46.631
Dad, do you have a stamp?

12:46.633 --> 12:48.233
[humming]

12:48.235 --> 12:50.802
- Dad? Dad?
- Oh! Oh.

12:50.804 --> 12:52.470
- Sorry.
- Oh, you scared me.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.439
Sorry.
Do you have a stamp?

12:54.441 --> 12:56.741
I want to mail
my course registration.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.676
Oh, sure. Sure.

12:58.678 --> 13:00.612
You mean you decided
on a major then?

13:00.614 --> 13:03.114
I was thinking
about social sciences.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.916
Maybe become a social worker
like you.

13:04.918 --> 13:08.019
Well, Lynn, I-I'm flattered

13:08.021 --> 13:09.821
and I-I'm impressed.

13:09.823 --> 13:12.724
It's not an easy road
you've chosen, you know.

13:12.726 --> 13:14.692
- It's not?
- No, no.

13:14.694 --> 13:16.161
It takes
a special kind of person

13:16.163 --> 13:18.863
to train all those years.

13:18.865 --> 13:20.732
All how many years?

13:20.734 --> 13:22.333
Well, um, let's see.

13:22.335 --> 13:25.069
You've got, uh, undergraduate
studies, four years.

13:25.071 --> 13:26.471
You've got two years
of grad school.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.439
You have your, uh, thesis

13:28.441 --> 13:30.441
your internships,
your field work--

13:30.443 --> 13:32.177
But it pays off
in the end, right?

13:32.179 --> 13:33.978
I mean
you really like your job.

13:33.980 --> 13:36.714
Oh, yeah, yeah.

13:36.716 --> 13:39.584
But there's not a lot of jobs
like mine out there, you know.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.052
Oh.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.887
And you're not gonna get rich.

13:42.889 --> 13:44.155
Hmm.

13:44.157 --> 13:47.258
But it's
a very rewarding career.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.793
You get to work
with a lot of people

13:48.795 --> 13:52.063
with some really
serious problems.

13:52.065 --> 13:55.366
Oh, so there is an upside.

13:55.368 --> 13:57.235
So, y-you want me
to mail this then?

13:57.237 --> 13:59.204
Not yet.

13:59.206 --> 14:01.840
I mean maybe
I could help more people

14:01.842 --> 14:03.641
as a ski instructor.

14:07.747 --> 14:10.381
So the cab broke down
in the seedy part

14:10.383 --> 14:12.917
of the Lower East Side, see?

14:12.919 --> 14:15.587
And just as the cabbie got out
to check the engine

14:15.589 --> 14:17.522
a big cloud of steam blew up

14:17.524 --> 14:20.225
from the deserted
subway station below.

14:20.227 --> 14:22.627
'The one they had to close
after a bunch of guys'

14:22.629 --> 14:24.963
'died mysteriously down there.'

14:24.965 --> 14:26.164
[wind howling]

14:26.166 --> 14:28.433
Aah! What's that?

14:28.435 --> 14:30.134
I think it was the wind.

14:30.136 --> 14:31.369
Unless it was a cab.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.504
[laughing]

14:33.506 --> 14:35.306
Aah! Cut that out!

14:35.308 --> 14:37.242
You're scaring Brian.

14:37.244 --> 14:38.676
It's just a story, ALF.

14:38.678 --> 14:40.144
What happened next, Jake?

14:40.146 --> 14:41.746
Okay, okay.

14:41.748 --> 14:43.715
Out of the cloud of steam..

14:43.717 --> 14:47.085
...came the phantom
of the subway

14:47.087 --> 14:49.020
dressed all in black.

14:49.022 --> 14:53.091
A hood covering
his skull-like face..

14:53.093 --> 14:55.026
...and instead of a hand..

14:55.028 --> 14:57.195
...he had a gleaming hook.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.963
Uh. Huh.

14:58.965 --> 15:02.367
Isn't it time to sneak across
the crick to the girl's camp

15:02.369 --> 15:04.836
and blow out
their citronella candles?

15:06.306 --> 15:07.505
Now, where was I?

15:07.507 --> 15:09.374
The gleaming hook.

15:09.910 --> 15:11.809
Sheesh.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.046
So the phantom hails the cab

15:15.048 --> 15:16.748
with his good hand.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.950
Now the Cabbie's scared,
so he yells

15:18.952 --> 15:21.219
"I'm off duty, buddy."

15:21.221 --> 15:24.689
'But the phantom
doesn't know from off duty.'

15:24.691 --> 15:28.026
'And slowly walks over
to the camp.'

15:28.028 --> 15:30.895
¶ Michael row your boat
ashore ¶¶

15:30.897 --> 15:33.965
Shh. ALF, the story
is just getting good.

15:33.967 --> 15:36.134
Now, all the Baptists.

15:36.136 --> 15:40.104
¶ Hallelujah ¶¶

15:40.106 --> 15:41.839
So, the phantom
wrenches into the cab

15:41.841 --> 15:43.241
and snags the cabbie
by the neck

15:43.243 --> 15:46.244
and drags him down
into the subway with him.

15:46.246 --> 15:48.913
Until all you could hear

15:48.915 --> 15:50.581
was the phantom..

15:50.583 --> 15:52.050
...laughing.

15:52.052 --> 15:54.552
[laughing]

15:54.554 --> 15:56.988
[wind howling]

15:56.990 --> 15:59.223
It's the haunted taxi.

15:59.225 --> 16:00.725
Yikes! Yikes!

16:00.727 --> 16:02.727
Yikes! Yikes! Yikes!

16:07.200 --> 16:09.200
(ALF)
Taxi! Taxi!

16:09.202 --> 16:10.702
Taxi!

16:13.873 --> 16:16.708
ALF is hailing a cab in the den.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.449
Exactly when did I lose control?

16:30.256 --> 16:31.889
(Jake)
'Yo, ALF!'

16:31.891 --> 16:34.192
(ALF)
'There's nobody here,
but us pillow shams.'

16:35.962 --> 16:37.996
[sighing]

16:37.998 --> 16:40.398
- What's your problem?
- Nothing.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.133
I was just afraid
I'd catch my death

16:42.135 --> 16:44.068
of gleaming hook out there.

16:44.070 --> 16:47.105
[sighing]
How's Brian supposed
to get over being afraid

16:47.107 --> 16:48.906
if you turn chicken on us?

16:48.908 --> 16:51.442
Let him get over his fear
of the dark in the morning

16:51.444 --> 16:54.112
when it's light out.

16:54.114 --> 16:56.180
We're camping
in your backyard.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.715
What do you think,
psychopaths get a map

16:57.717 --> 17:00.451
of the Tanner house
from the AAA?

17:00.453 --> 17:02.920
Do I look that stupid?

17:02.922 --> 17:05.590
I'm talking about real dangers.

17:05.592 --> 17:08.693
Like...slugs.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.628
You're scared of slugs?

17:10.630 --> 17:13.998
Real threat to those of us
who go barefoot.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.800
If I promise
to de-slug the yard

17:15.802 --> 17:17.135
will you come back outside?

17:17.137 --> 17:18.202
No way.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.538
Hey, we were making
real progress out there.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.540
But once Brian realizes
you're scared

17:22.542 --> 17:23.908
he'll be scared.

17:23.910 --> 17:25.777
I mean you could ruin
his whole life.

17:25.779 --> 17:27.378
What girl's gonna
wanna date a guy

17:27.380 --> 17:29.313
who won't go out after dark?

17:29.315 --> 17:32.183
Then you help him.
I can't.

17:32.185 --> 17:35.153
I'm telling you,
there's nothing scary out there.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.754
Unless you count
that herd of stray cats

17:36.756 --> 17:39.924
that prowls every night.

17:39.926 --> 17:41.426
Cats?

17:41.428 --> 17:43.761
Big ones.
Lots of them too.

17:46.332 --> 17:49.434
Well, maybe you're right.

17:49.436 --> 17:51.602
How scary can our backyard be?

17:51.604 --> 17:53.271
I knew you'd come around.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.239
I'm only doing this for Brian.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.008
Yeah, I know.

17:57.010 --> 18:00.011
Can we stop in the kitchen
and get the wok?

18:02.148 --> 18:04.782
- Oh, hey, Mr. Tanner.
- Hello, Jake.

18:06.186 --> 18:08.152
Oh, hi, Willie. What's up?

18:08.154 --> 18:11.222
Nothing much.
What's up with you?

18:11.224 --> 18:13.825
Same old, same old.

18:13.827 --> 18:16.594
So I shouldn't be concerned
about that little taxi dance

18:16.596 --> 18:18.296
through the den?

18:18.298 --> 18:21.132
No. No, we got everything
under control.

18:21.134 --> 18:22.300
Fine.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.268
Fine. Where's, uh, Brian?

18:24.270 --> 18:25.536
Oh, he's outside.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.238
He's outside.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.706
We're going back there now.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.842
We're going back there now.

18:30.844 --> 18:31.876
Bye.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.344
Bye.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.982
If a cab shows up
on the den..

18:39.252 --> 18:41.252
...I'm taking it.

18:44.124 --> 18:46.557
Oh, and no more
scary stories, Jake.

18:46.559 --> 18:49.060
Well, just one more.
The Headless Stockbroker.

18:49.062 --> 18:50.595
Forget it.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.298
Where is Brian?

18:55.902 --> 18:59.170
Oh, no!
He's been gleaming hooked!

19:00.306 --> 19:02.306
Maybe he's in the tent.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.309
Hey, he is in here.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.677
He's sleeping.

19:06.679 --> 19:09.313
So much for being afraid
of the dark.

19:09.315 --> 19:10.915
Well, my work here is done.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.950
- See you at brunch.
- Wait!

19:12.952 --> 19:14.619
What if he wakes up
in the middle of the night

19:14.621 --> 19:16.154
and sees you deserted him?

19:16.156 --> 19:17.755
Cover for me.

19:17.757 --> 19:21.058
Come on, ALF.
Brian's counting on you.

19:21.060 --> 19:24.061
Oh. I hate being a role model!

19:27.100 --> 19:29.100
Here, sluggy.

19:29.102 --> 19:30.868
'Here I come.'

19:30.870 --> 19:33.838
'Here, sluggy, sluggy, sluggy.'

19:33.840 --> 19:36.607
'Don't be in my sleeping bag.'

19:36.609 --> 19:38.976
'Good sluggy.'

19:38.978 --> 19:40.745
Hey, who's gonna tuck me in?

19:40.747 --> 19:44.215
Oh, nobody gets tucked in
in the wilderness.

19:44.217 --> 19:46.017
Well, at least zip me up.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.086
[sighing]

19:51.457 --> 19:53.457
Hey, hey, watch the fur.

19:53.459 --> 19:54.892
It's for your own protection.

19:54.894 --> 19:57.562
We don't want any slugs
getting in, do we?

19:57.564 --> 20:00.765
Oh! Zip it up over my head.

20:02.402 --> 20:03.668
Goodnight, ALF.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.670
Goodnight, John-Boy.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.340
It was right after
the stock market crashed.

20:09.342 --> 20:11.642
There was this
headless stockbroker!

20:11.644 --> 20:13.444

I made fun of your major.

20:50.316 --> 20:53.184
So I brought you this.

It's the evolution of art
from primitive cave drawings

20:57.757 --> 21:00.524
to "The Wizard Of Id."

21:00.526 --> 21:02.693
Oh, Willie.

21:02.695 --> 21:05.763
You know, it occurred to me

21:05.765 --> 21:06.998
no matter what our kids become

21:07.000 --> 21:08.899
social workers,
art historians

they're gonna,
they're gonna inherit ALF

21:12.872 --> 21:14.338
and be broke anyway.

21:15.241 --> 21:19.110
Willie.
Willie, this is lovely.

21:19.112 --> 21:21.545
I'm sorry if I overreacted.

21:21.547 --> 21:23.614
We shouldn't argue
over something so silly..

21:23.616 --> 21:26.651
- Mm-hmm.
- As pie charts.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.286
Silly old pie charts.

21:28.288 --> 21:30.087

21:31.958 --> 21:34.425
Well, I finally picked
my courses.

21:34.427 --> 21:37.962
I trust you've made
a good career choice.

21:37.964 --> 21:41.132
You're majoring...in..

21:43.670 --> 21:45.670
Nothing.

21:45.672 --> 21:48.139
I found out that with all
of the required subjects

21:48.141 --> 21:50.908
I have to take I'm not gonna
have time for any courses

21:50.910 --> 21:53.411
in my major
until I'm a junior anyway.

21:53.413 --> 21:55.212
So I'll decide then.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.649
(ALF)
'Oh, Willie!'

21:58.651 --> 22:00.451
Yeah. What, ALF?

22:00.453 --> 22:03.621
'Could you come out here
and help me with my knots?'

22:03.623 --> 22:05.089
No, I'm busy, ALF.

22:05.091 --> 22:07.692
If you want help,
come on in here.

22:07.694 --> 22:09.360
'Alright.'

22:15.968 --> 22:19.637
Oh! Come over here,
I'll, I'll untie you.

22:19.639 --> 22:21.939
I would,
