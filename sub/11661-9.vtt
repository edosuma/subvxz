(mellow music playing)

01:01.433 --> 01:02.100
Thank you.

01:06.133 --> 01:06.800
Oh.

01:07.834 --> 01:10.367
Oh, a person cannot open a letter anymore

01:10.433 --> 01:13.367
without being accosted by some vile,
disgusting thing.

01:13.834 --> 01:17.033
Isn't it illegal to send filth
through the mail?

01:17.100 --> 01:18.367
What is it, Blanche?

01:18.433 --> 01:20.433
A letter from the IRS.

01:24.533 --> 01:26.333
I am being audited.

01:26.900 --> 01:30.200
It's aggravating, yes, but you don't have
anything to worry about.

01:30.667 --> 01:31.467
(sighs)

01:31.533 --> 01:32.333
Do you?

01:32.400 --> 01:35.800
No, but you know how nitpicky they can be.

01:35.867 --> 01:41.500
You don't declare the tiniest thing,
they can blow it all out of proportion.

01:41.567 --> 01:43.166
What didn't you declare?

01:43.233 --> 01:44.066
You.

01:46.600 --> 01:47.266
Me?

01:47.333 --> 01:48.734
And Rose and Sophia.

01:50.500 --> 01:53.767
Over the past five years,
I might have forgotten to mention

01:53.834 --> 01:55.767
y'all are living with me and paying rent.

01:56.333 --> 01:57.867
We slipped your mind?

01:57.934 --> 02:01.700
You know I think of you girls as family.

02:01.767 --> 02:05.567
How would it look
if I was charging family rent?

02:06.033 --> 02:06.834
Honest.

02:09.033 --> 02:13.233
Don't you ever get a nosebleed
from taking the high road all the time?

02:15.266 --> 02:17.166
Oh, this is such an upsetting day.

02:17.233 --> 02:18.467
For both of us.

02:18.533 --> 02:19.900
What's wrong with you?

02:19.967 --> 02:24.433
I ran into an old high school friend,
Helen Colquist.

02:24.500 --> 02:25.767
She just moved to Miami.

02:25.834 --> 02:29.500
We decided to get together today.

02:29.567 --> 02:32.700
I got out the yearbook
so we could go down memory lane.

02:32.767 --> 02:33.567
(Blanche) Oh...

02:33.633 --> 02:36.066
Last night,
she had a heart attack and died.

02:36.133 --> 02:37.533
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.633
I've been looking through the book.

02:39.700 --> 02:43.500
I can't believe
how many of my classmates are gone.

02:43.567 --> 02:44.333
(Blanche groans)

02:44.400 --> 02:45.367
Look.

02:45.433 --> 02:49.033
Frank Bonitardi, tight end
on the football team, heart attack.

02:49.100 --> 02:49.834
Dead.

02:49.900 --> 02:52.166
Don't think of it as Frank being dead.

02:52.233 --> 02:55.100
Think of it as God telling Frank
to go deep.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.000
-David Brittingham.
-What happened to him?

03:03.066 --> 03:07.033
God told David to drive into a wall
at 80 miles an hour.

03:10.000 --> 03:10.767
What are you doing?

03:10.834 --> 03:13.834
Going through Dorothy's yearbook
to see who's dead.

03:13.900 --> 03:16.233
That's my pussycat, fun, fun, fun.

03:17.867 --> 03:19.967
Ma, do you remember Helen Colquist?

03:20.033 --> 03:22.633
That tremendously fat woman
with a wooden leg

03:22.700 --> 03:25.834
and a hairless cat named Cincinnati Jake?

03:25.900 --> 03:26.633
No.

03:27.633 --> 03:28.867
Then I don't remember her.

03:30.467 --> 03:31.834
Look.

03:32.367 --> 03:35.300
A list of things I wanted to do
with my life.

03:35.367 --> 03:38.633
I had a list like that,
and I've done most of them,

03:40.967 --> 03:42.600
except for Burt Lancaster.

03:44.533 --> 03:46.467
I haven't done half of these.

03:46.533 --> 03:49.133
What am I? A substitute teacher.

03:49.200 --> 03:52.934
I'll never be rich before 21
or be homecoming queen.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.233
You can still be homecoming queen.

03:55.300 --> 03:57.133
It will just be a different kind of home.

04:02.633 --> 04:06.333
-What else is on your list, Dorothy?
-Uh, I wanted to entertain people.

04:06.400 --> 04:09.233
Oh, you, an entertainer?
(laughs)

04:09.300 --> 04:10.333
Yes.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.967
I was in the drama club

04:12.033 --> 04:15.233
and voted the most humorous girl
in my class.

04:15.300 --> 04:17.533
She went to a special school for the dull.

04:19.066 --> 04:20.133
I did not.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.834
Okay. It's time for dinner.

04:23.900 --> 04:26.700
Dorothy, tell me something else
that's on your list.

04:27.633 --> 04:28.667
An entertainer.

04:28.734 --> 04:30.200
(cackles)

04:30.266 --> 04:32.934
Entertaining people, getting my masters,

04:33.000 --> 04:35.500
and I wanted to sleep
with Michael Delvecchio.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.433
Wait a minute.

04:38.900 --> 04:42.300
Is he tall with black hair,
a mole on his cheek,

04:42.367 --> 04:43.900
sells insurance in New York city?

04:43.967 --> 04:45.166
Yes.

04:45.233 --> 04:46.800
You didn't miss much.

04:51.533 --> 04:54.400
The point is,
I didn't do anything on my list.

04:54.467 --> 04:57.700
All my dreams went unfulfilled.

04:57.767 --> 05:00.367
Yesterday,
when I was talking to Helen Colquist,

05:00.433 --> 05:03.934
she said she always wanted
to go to the Holy Land.

05:04.934 --> 05:06.266
She just bought the ticket.

05:06.333 --> 05:07.300
Now she's dead.

05:08.533 --> 05:09.533
Hi.

05:09.600 --> 05:10.767
What a day.

05:10.834 --> 05:11.834
Oh, you, too?

05:11.900 --> 05:12.734
(sighs)

05:12.800 --> 05:14.433
You know Roger Barton,

05:14.500 --> 05:16.800
the man who works in the cubicle
next to me?

05:17.266 --> 05:18.533
He doesn't like me.

05:19.133 --> 05:21.367
Everybody's always liked me.

05:22.567 --> 05:25.000
Maybe your chemistry's just off.

05:25.066 --> 05:26.633
Everybody doesn't have to like you.

05:26.700 --> 05:28.266
Oh, yes, they do.

05:28.700 --> 05:31.867
Dorothy, you're the smart one,
and, Blanche, you're the sexy one,

05:31.934 --> 05:33.834
and, Sophia, you're the old one.

05:37.133 --> 05:38.467
I'm the nice one.

05:39.834 --> 05:41.767
Everybody always likes me.

05:41.834 --> 05:44.000
The old one isn't so crazy about you.

05:46.734 --> 05:49.133
Roger likes everybody else in the office.

05:49.200 --> 05:50.600
Why doesn't he like me?

05:50.667 --> 05:52.667
I go out of my way to be friendly.

05:52.734 --> 05:57.000
That happy thought of the day
I give everyone,

05:57.300 --> 05:58.934
he doesn't like that.

05:59.700 --> 06:00.834
But I have a plan.

06:01.433 --> 06:02.400
What is your plan?

06:03.300 --> 06:04.800
His dog died.

06:04.867 --> 06:06.066
That's your plan?

06:07.200 --> 06:09.367
No, I'm going to replace his dog.

06:09.834 --> 06:13.233
Rose, you don't even like
bringing me my slippers.

06:18.934 --> 06:22.300
I'm getting him a new pet to replace his.

06:22.734 --> 06:25.734
His dog lifted his leg
on an electric fence.

06:29.033 --> 06:30.633
Poor Sparky.

06:35.433 --> 06:39.900
To show him how sorry I am,
I'm going to get him another pet.

06:39.967 --> 06:42.400
You're trying a little too hard.

06:42.467 --> 06:45.333
No. I admire you.

06:45.400 --> 06:47.633
When you want something to happen,
you go for it.

06:47.700 --> 06:49.567
Me? I dream.

06:49.633 --> 06:51.633
You're on that show biz kick?

06:51.700 --> 06:55.533
I was always pretty good at it,
even in high school.

06:55.600 --> 06:59.433
Remember those variety shows
my class used to put on?

06:59.500 --> 07:01.533
I was very good.

07:01.600 --> 07:05.300
I'd get up and tell a few jokes
about the teachers,

07:05.367 --> 07:06.467
about the cafeteria food.

07:06.533 --> 07:09.867
Ma, do you remember,
"You call this tapioca?"

07:09.934 --> 07:13.800
(laughs)

07:13.867 --> 07:15.000
Timeless.

07:17.300 --> 07:21.000
The kids really liked me.
They laughed. I felt great.

07:21.066 --> 07:24.700
If there's something you're aching to do,
do it.

07:24.767 --> 07:27.600
Remember going to amateur night
at the comedy barrel?

07:27.667 --> 07:30.066
You're as good as those people.

07:30.133 --> 07:33.333
I couldn't.
I'd be up there sweating bullets.

07:33.400 --> 07:34.967
And dodging some.

07:36.567 --> 07:38.233
You should try it, Dorothy,

07:38.300 --> 07:41.767
and we'd be right there, cheering you on.

07:41.834 --> 07:44.834
It's crazy. What if I die out there?

07:44.900 --> 07:48.967
Who cares if you stink, if nobody laughs,

07:49.033 --> 07:51.333
or you make a fool of yourself?

07:51.400 --> 07:52.100
I care.

07:52.166 --> 07:53.633
Then you got problems.

07:55.667 --> 07:58.667
(mellow music playing)

08:00.633 --> 08:01.834
(doorbell rings)

08:01.900 --> 08:02.900
Coming.

08:05.433 --> 08:06.633
Roger!

08:07.300 --> 08:11.166
I can't tell you how sorry I am
about Sparky.

08:11.233 --> 08:12.333
How are you?

08:12.400 --> 08:13.600
Been better.

08:13.667 --> 08:15.400
I come to talk to you
about this cat you sent me.

08:15.467 --> 08:19.533
When I saw him at the pound,
I knew he'd be just the cat for you.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.734
I named him Buster.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.300
Isn't he precious?

08:22.367 --> 08:23.633
He mauled me.

08:25.467 --> 08:27.800
Buster did that? But he's so sweet.

08:27.867 --> 08:30.567
Well he doesn't like me.

08:30.633 --> 08:32.266
Sometimes in life that happens.

08:32.333 --> 08:34.266
I don't like you.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.667
But everybody likes me.

08:37.734 --> 08:39.533
Can't say that anymore, Rose.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.033
Do you really hate me?

08:42.100 --> 08:42.867
Oh, yeah.

08:44.133 --> 08:46.667
Here's Buster back.

08:47.133 --> 08:50.633
You told me you were an animal lover.
I thought maybe I could replace your loss.

08:50.700 --> 08:54.133
Well, I didn't need a replacement.
I had my parakeet.

08:54.200 --> 08:58.100
At least until you sent that cat from hell
into our lives.

08:59.700 --> 09:00.767
You don't mean...

09:00.834 --> 09:03.133
I don't think you're gonna have
to feed Buster for a while.

09:04.834 --> 09:05.867
Goodbye, Rose.

09:05.934 --> 09:07.233
When you see me at work,

09:07.300 --> 09:10.500
don't say good morning,
don't leave me those cheery notes.

09:10.567 --> 09:14.033
And please don't put on those little
puppet shows over the partition.

09:15.100 --> 09:18.166
In fact, don't ever think of me again.

09:20.934 --> 09:22.266
Oh.

09:22.934 --> 09:24.266
Who's cat is this?

09:24.333 --> 09:27.934
I got it at the pound for somebody
and now they don't want him.

09:28.033 --> 09:30.533
I was talking to Sarah Antonelli.

09:30.600 --> 09:33.433
She's got a cellar full of mice
and she needs a cat.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.266
You think this guy's
got the killer instinct?

09:35.734 --> 09:37.667
Oh, I think so.

09:38.500 --> 09:39.800
Please take him, Sophia.

09:39.867 --> 09:41.266
His name is Buster.

09:41.333 --> 09:43.133
He sure is cute.

09:43.600 --> 09:46.533
I love the way he's got that feather
behind his ear.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.700
(tongue clicking)

09:48.767 --> 09:49.834
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

09:56.667 --> 09:58.133
What's in the shoe box, Blanche?

09:58.200 --> 10:01.367
Every last receipt
and paper scrap I've collected

10:01.433 --> 10:02.734
over the last five years.

10:03.834 --> 10:05.734
Or a pair of shoes.

10:07.834 --> 10:09.100
What will I do?

10:09.166 --> 10:12.433
My accountant told me
to bring everything tomorrow.

10:12.500 --> 10:14.867
Include a cake with a file in it.

10:15.600 --> 10:16.967
Where are your receipts?

10:17.033 --> 10:21.033
Aren't receipts only needed
if the dresses you bought didn't fit?

10:21.367 --> 10:22.867
I'm lousy at this.

10:22.934 --> 10:24.633
I see.

10:24.700 --> 10:26.934
It was easier when I was married.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
I'd buy something expensive.
George would yell at me.

10:30.066 --> 10:32.934
I'd put on a see-through nightie,
end of discussion.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.700
Why can't the government work that way?

10:37.300 --> 10:40.667
It often does.

10:42.934 --> 10:47.200
This money you forgot to give to the IRS,
what happened to it?

10:47.266 --> 10:49.567
I can't remember what happened
to every penny.

10:50.033 --> 10:51.667
I gave some to charity.

10:51.734 --> 10:54.767
Charitable deductions.
Blanche, that's great.

10:54.834 --> 10:57.367
What was it, United Fund,
Greenpeace, you remember?

10:57.433 --> 11:01.100
In 1985,
I bought the "We Are The World" album.

11:07.033 --> 11:08.633
Dorothy, have you seen my teeth?

11:11.867 --> 11:13.633
They're in your mouth, Ma.

11:14.000 --> 11:14.967
I know that.

11:15.033 --> 11:17.567
Don't they look good?
I ran them through the dishwasher.

11:21.767 --> 11:23.100
Ma, listen to me.

11:24.467 --> 11:27.100
You got Martha Raye and Madge
mixed up again.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.400
Oh, yeah.

11:30.867 --> 11:33.133
Listen to this joke.

11:33.467 --> 11:34.333
Is this from your act?

11:34.400 --> 11:35.867
Could be.

11:35.934 --> 11:39.033
I signed up at the comedy barrel
for Monday night.

11:39.100 --> 11:40.333
Listen.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.166
Okay. Make me laugh.

11:42.233 --> 11:43.300
Okay. Here we go.

11:43.834 --> 11:45.800
It seems there was this doctor.

11:45.867 --> 11:49.066
"It seems there was"?
What is this, existentialist humor?

11:49.967 --> 11:51.400
Was there a doctor or not?

11:51.467 --> 11:53.934
There was this doctor.

11:54.000 --> 11:54.934
He's sitting in the park.

11:55.000 --> 11:55.934
What time of year?

11:56.767 --> 11:58.000
What's the difference?

11:58.066 --> 11:59.333
Set the scene.

11:59.400 --> 12:00.667
Who's telling this joke?

12:00.734 --> 12:02.133
At the moment, nobody.

12:03.900 --> 12:06.633
You know,
you could be a little supportive.

12:06.700 --> 12:08.600
I've always been supportive.

12:08.667 --> 12:11.767
Remember when you wanted to go to Canada
to avoid being drafted?

12:12.967 --> 12:15.266
Ma, that was my brother Phil.

12:15.333 --> 12:18.467
Oh, yeah. I got confused.
He was wearing your dress.

12:21.100 --> 12:22.033
Okay.

12:22.100 --> 12:24.633
How about when you were unmarried
and pregnant?

12:24.700 --> 12:26.400
I remember your exact words,

12:26.467 --> 12:29.700
"Get out of my house. You're dead.
I have no daughter named Dorothy."

12:29.767 --> 12:32.567
Sure.
In that tone of voice, it sounds bad.

12:35.266 --> 12:36.734
But I'm supporting you now.

12:36.800 --> 12:39.333
I'm living with you
in your twilight years.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.633
Ma, these are your twilight years.

12:42.533 --> 12:46.400
I'm supposed to be dead.
These are your twilight years.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.100
I never needed you more.

12:49.166 --> 12:51.934
This is very important.

12:52.033 --> 12:54.066
I could fall flat on my face.

12:54.133 --> 12:56.233
Fall the other way. It's funnier.

13:01.166 --> 13:04.166
(quirky music playing)

13:06.467 --> 13:08.000
Thank you and goodnight.

13:08.367 --> 13:09.033
Well, Ma?

13:09.533 --> 13:11.033
5 minutes and 10 seconds.

13:11.100 --> 13:12.600
That's long.

13:12.667 --> 13:13.633
What should I cut?

13:13.700 --> 13:16.233
After hearing that act, your throat.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.967
Hi, Blanche.
How was it at the accountant's?

13:22.033 --> 13:23.467
(Blanche) Fine.

13:23.533 --> 13:25.066
In the waiting room,

13:25.133 --> 13:28.300
I read a magazine
listing the 10 richest American men.

13:28.367 --> 13:31.033
Merv Griffin's moved up two notches.

13:31.100 --> 13:33.333
He probably ate the two ahead of him.

13:35.367 --> 13:39.600
Good news from my accountant,
I'm being audited Tuesday.

13:39.667 --> 13:40.867
Oh, lucky you.

13:40.934 --> 13:45.033
My accountant reminded me
I've been audited before,

13:45.100 --> 13:47.700
and I've never paid a penny in back taxes.

13:47.767 --> 13:50.333
I have a way with auditors.

13:50.400 --> 13:54.033
Last time I was audited,
I got money back from the government.

13:57.700 --> 14:01.333
It's not a refund
when he leaves 20s on your night stand.

14:08.467 --> 14:10.600
Do you want to see my vanskap kaka?

14:10.667 --> 14:12.533
If I don't have to show you mine.

14:15.900 --> 14:18.200
It's a St. Olaf friendship cake.

14:18.266 --> 14:20.033
It's for Roger.

14:20.100 --> 14:25.700
It's made with milk, sugar, honey,
lots of love, and a drop of sunshine.

14:25.767 --> 14:28.333
Leave the poor man alone.

14:28.400 --> 14:31.133
If he knew me, he'd like me.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.166
Why? I know you. I don't like you.

14:34.500 --> 14:35.900
You just say that.

14:35.967 --> 14:37.100
Repeatedly.

14:37.166 --> 14:39.233
(laughs)

14:39.300 --> 14:41.200
Rose, you've become obsessed.

14:41.266 --> 14:44.467
You have this irrational need
for Roger to like you.

14:44.533 --> 14:46.100
Why is that?

14:46.166 --> 14:49.166
It started as a kid at the orphanage.

14:49.567 --> 14:52.900
You see, only the happy, nice kids
got adopted.

14:52.967 --> 14:56.667
I tried to be happy and nice all the time.

14:57.033 --> 15:00.100
Because the truth is,
if you treat somebody nicely,

15:00.166 --> 15:01.300
they'll take you home.

15:07.567 --> 15:09.567
I've always found that to be true.

15:13.166 --> 15:15.800
(sighs)
I feel like the kid at the orphanage.

15:15.867 --> 15:20.166
I'll tell you a story
about a young girl in high school

15:20.233 --> 15:23.300
who was very insecure
about kids liking her.

15:23.367 --> 15:28.300
Now, she would do anything,
anything to gain their approval.

15:28.367 --> 15:32.400
She'd do their homework
while her grades suffered.

15:32.467 --> 15:34.367
She would give them her lunch money,

15:34.433 --> 15:37.533
believing that she could buy
their acceptance.

15:37.600 --> 15:41.667
Finally,
lonely and desperate for affection,

15:42.667 --> 15:44.100
she gave her virginity

15:44.166 --> 15:47.266
to the first boy
who showed her the slightest attention.

15:49.533 --> 15:51.900
Blanche, until you told this story,

15:51.967 --> 15:54.266
I never realized
how much we had in common.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.600
We don't have anything in common.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.467
Sophia told me that story about you.

16:08.100 --> 16:12.200
Rose, there's always going to be somebody
who doesn't like you.

16:12.266 --> 16:17.467
When you find that person,
you try even harder to make them like you.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.934
Did I ever tell you
about Herde Shornbohrst?

16:21.000 --> 16:22.333
-Yes, yes.
-Many times.

16:22.400 --> 16:23.600
You have.

16:23.667 --> 16:28.066
Then you remember
he was St. Olaf's most famous shepherd.

16:28.700 --> 16:30.834
Well, Herde used to say,

16:30.900 --> 16:34.834
"You can have 100 sheep,
and if one goes astray,

16:34.900 --> 16:37.467
that's the one you go look for,

16:37.533 --> 16:39.567
especially if it's the best-looking one."

16:42.767 --> 16:45.667
Rose has got to find some new role models.

16:47.767 --> 16:50.767
(quirky music playing)

16:59.467 --> 17:00.567
(doorbell chimes)

17:03.700 --> 17:04.700
Rose!

17:04.767 --> 17:06.166
I was just thinking about you.

17:06.700 --> 17:07.433
Really?

17:07.500 --> 17:09.100
Yeah, my hand was throbbing.

17:10.967 --> 17:12.834
I brought you a vanskap kaka.

17:12.900 --> 17:15.500
It's a traditional
St. Olaf friendship cake.

17:15.567 --> 17:20.000
I don't want gifts.
I don't want anything to do with you.

17:21.166 --> 17:22.367
Let me ask you something.

17:22.433 --> 17:26.433
What is your idea of a friend?

17:26.500 --> 17:31.600
A friend's someone who likes you,
respects you, and does things for you.

17:31.667 --> 17:35.967
So, if I was your friend,
you would respect my wishes?

17:36.033 --> 17:37.633
'Course. I'd have to.

17:37.700 --> 17:41.767
I've asked you to leave me alone,
and you haven't.

17:41.834 --> 17:43.633
You said we weren't friends.

17:43.700 --> 17:45.834
What if we were friends?

17:45.900 --> 17:48.533
I'd have to do it. We'd be friends.

17:48.600 --> 17:49.934
Then we're friends!

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
Really?

17:51.066 --> 17:53.300
Forever. But leave me alone.

17:53.367 --> 17:55.033
That's what friends are for.

17:55.333 --> 17:56.300
See you, pal.

17:56.367 --> 18:00.533
It means so much to hear you say that.
(chuckle)

18:01.900 --> 18:03.166
See you, buddy.

18:05.066 --> 18:08.066
(mellow music playing)

18:10.000 --> 18:12.900
(laughter)

18:14.900 --> 18:16.233
You're looking awfully pale.

18:16.300 --> 18:17.066
Are you all right?

18:17.133 --> 18:20.667
How important is fulfilling
your life's dream?

18:20.734 --> 18:21.867
What's the big deal?

18:21.934 --> 18:24.533
You've come this far. Go through with it.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.333
What if nobody laughs?

18:26.400 --> 18:28.367
Then you'll know how Lisa Bonet feels.

18:31.333 --> 18:33.000
Okay, okay, who's got number 14?

18:33.066 --> 18:34.900
Oh, God. I do.

18:34.967 --> 18:36.800
Okay, sweetie. You're on next.

18:36.867 --> 18:39.967
(laughter)

18:40.033 --> 18:44.800
The guy says, "My St. Bernard?
I thought it was your St. Bernard."

18:44.867 --> 18:47.433
(laughter)

18:47.500 --> 18:50.266
I'll go wash my mouth out with soap.

18:50.333 --> 18:51.467
Good night, everybody.

18:51.533 --> 18:54.333
(applause)

18:54.400 --> 18:58.800
There goes the bad boy of comedy,
Tricky Dicky Hertz.

18:59.867 --> 19:02.433
Not the kind of guy
you'd want to meet your mother.

19:02.900 --> 19:08.100
Let's bring out a lady
who claims to know Siegfried from Roy,

19:08.166 --> 19:11.300
Dorothy "Show Us Your" Zbornak!

19:11.367 --> 19:14.367
(applause)

19:16.700 --> 19:19.567
Uh, you'll have to excuse me.

19:19.633 --> 19:20.667
I'm a little nervous.

19:20.734 --> 19:22.533
I'm not really a comedian.

19:23.633 --> 19:25.333
Boy, it's hot up here.

19:25.400 --> 19:26.667
How hot is it?

19:26.734 --> 19:29.900
(laughter)

19:31.133 --> 19:34.533
I don't know, but it's really hot.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.400
Hi-yo!

19:39.533 --> 19:42.066
As I said before, I'm Dorothy Zbornak.

19:42.133 --> 19:45.400
That's spelled just the way it sounds.

19:47.333 --> 19:49.300
You're dying. Ask us where we're from.

19:50.033 --> 19:52.734
That's my mother,
the incredible shrinking woman.

19:52.800 --> 19:53.567
(chuckles)

19:53.633 --> 19:56.800
She's sitting with the two other women
I live with.

19:57.433 --> 20:02.900
At our ages, the four of us
living together in the same house,

20:02.967 --> 20:05.400
we go through so many hormone changes,

20:05.467 --> 20:08.900
some nights,
we can read by the hot flashes.

20:08.967 --> 20:11.433
(laughter)

20:12.066 --> 20:16.200
It's interesting when one of us dates
an eligible man.

20:16.266 --> 20:18.767
Or as we call them, "A live one."

20:18.834 --> 20:21.100
(laughter)

20:21.166 --> 20:22.967
It's not a prerequisite.

20:23.033 --> 20:26.066
I've been known to date
a guy on life support.

20:26.133 --> 20:27.867
(laughter)

20:27.934 --> 20:32.667
The trouble with a guy on life support
is you always have to go to his place.

20:32.734 --> 20:34.867
(laughter)

20:34.934 --> 20:36.800
Every guy has an angle.

20:36.867 --> 20:39.667
(laughter)

20:39.734 --> 20:43.100
That's the trouble
with guys here in Miami.

20:43.166 --> 20:45.800
They simply cannot say
those three little words,

20:45.867 --> 20:47.900
"Quick! Call 9-1-1!"

20:47.967 --> 20:49.000
(laughter)

20:56.066 --> 20:58.567
So, that's who I am,

20:58.633 --> 21:01.367
a substitute teacher with hot flashes

21:01.433 --> 21:04.700
who still lives with her mother
who heckles her.

21:06.300 --> 21:10.367
Thank you for finding my life
more amusing than I do.

21:11.033 --> 21:13.233
Good night. Thank you. You're beautiful.

21:13.300 --> 21:15.100
(applause)

21:27.700 --> 21:30.967
Pussycat, I've been working
on some jokes for your act.

21:32.200 --> 21:34.867
Why did Rose throw the clock
out the window?

21:35.500 --> 21:36.667
I don't know, Ma. Why?

21:36.734 --> 21:38.633
Because she's a moron.

21:38.700 --> 21:40.734
(laughs)

21:40.800 --> 21:41.900
I got millions of 'em.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.333
I won't be doing my stand-up routine
anymore.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.066
Why? You were great.

21:48.133 --> 21:52.166
I realized what I'm doing
is no different from my dream.

21:52.233 --> 21:56.834
Whenever I stand before a classroom,
I face the same challenges.

21:56.900 --> 22:00.133
Only I get something
I didn't feel last night,

22:00.600 --> 22:04.433
that maybe, possibly, I've managed
to teach them a little something.

22:05.033 --> 22:08.667
Doing stand-up
was like having sex with Stan.

22:09.133 --> 22:12.033
I was nervous before,
felt pretty good during,

22:12.100 --> 22:15.367
and I'm thrilled
that I never have to do it again.

22:20.133 --> 22:21.367
How do I look?

22:22.033 --> 22:23.767
Is today your audit?

22:23.834 --> 22:24.567
Yes.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.166
He should be here any minute.

22:31.433 --> 22:34.100
Blanche, how are you going to explain
that outfit?

22:34.166 --> 22:35.633
The zipper's in the back?

22:37.533 --> 22:38.834
(doorbell rings)

22:38.900 --> 22:39.567
(sighs)

22:42.734 --> 22:43.900
Wish me luck.

22:50.233 --> 22:51.433
Blanche Devereaux?

22:51.500 --> 22:52.667
Yes.

22:52.734 --> 22:54.633
Gloria Schmidt, IRS.

23:00.834 --> 23:02.834
Come on in. I'll write you a check.

23:05.867 --> 23:08.400
(quirky music playing)

23:14.500 --> 23:17.500
(closing theme music playing)
