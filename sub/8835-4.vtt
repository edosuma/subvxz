OH, WELL,
WHATEVER YOU SAY, MA'AM.

40:44.401 --> 40:45.736
HOW ABOUT
I MEET YOU AFTERWARD?

40:45.903 --> 40:48.447
WELL, I THOUGHT MAYBE
WE COULD GO TOGETHER.

40:48.614 --> 40:51.700
ME? OH, NO, MA'AM.
NOT ME.

40:51.867 --> 40:53.327
WHY NOT?

40:53.494 --> 40:54.870
I DON'T BELIEVE
IN IT.

40:56.247 --> 40:57.915
WELL, YOU DO
BELIEVE IN GOD.

40:58.082 --> 41:00.000
OH, I DID ONCE.
NOT ANYMORE.

41:01.627 --> 41:03.379
YOU CAN'T MEAN THAT...

41:03.546 --> 41:04.839
SURELY YOU CAN'T.

41:05.005 --> 41:06.674
WHY, YES, MA'AM,
I DO.

41:12.888 --> 41:16.100
WELL, HOW ABOUT IT,
MA'AM?

41:16.267 --> 41:17.309
HOW ABOUT WHAT?

41:17.476 --> 41:18.894
FISHING SUNDAY.

41:21.313 --> 41:24.275
NO. I'M AFRAID
I CAN'T.

41:27.027 --> 41:28.863
OH, UM...

41:31.282 --> 41:34.535
WELL, UH, GUESS
I BEST BE ON MY WAY.

41:40.082 --> 41:42.126
YOU SURE ARE HARD
TO FIGURE OUT, MA'AM.

41:42.293 --> 41:45.963
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER MOST
EVERY DAY FOR 2 WEEKS.

41:46.130 --> 41:49.633
WE HAD FUN... AT LEAST I DID.
THOUGHT YOU DID, TOO.

41:49.800 --> 41:53.304
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE
I AIN'T A CHURCH-GOING MAN?

41:53.470 --> 41:56.557
I'M STILL THE SAME PERSON
I WAS WHEN YOU MET ME.

41:58.267 --> 42:00.227
SO AM I.

42:01.979 --> 42:05.649
YEAH, WELL, UH,
PROBABLY JUST AS WELL.

42:05.816 --> 42:08.027
THE FISH AIN'T BITING
TOO GOOD ANYHOW.

42:23.375 --> 42:25.377
OH, MRS. SNIDER,
I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU.

42:25.544 --> 42:27.671
I JUST STOPPED
BY THE POST OFFICE.

42:27.838 --> 42:30.466
THERE'S NOTHING
FOR YOU TODAY.

42:30.633 --> 42:33.510
WELL, I REALLY JUST
STOPPED BY TO TELL YOU

42:33.677 --> 42:37.306
HOW MUCH WE ENJOYED HAVING
YOU OVER THE OTHER NIGHT.

42:37.473 --> 42:40.059
I ENJOYED IT, TOO.

42:40.226 --> 42:41.852
WE'D LIKE TO HAVE
YOU OUT AGAIN.

42:42.019 --> 42:43.938
I COULDN'T.

42:44.104 --> 42:44.939
BUT I THOUGHT--

42:45.105 --> 42:46.732
I'M SORRY.

43:04.041 --> 43:07.044
HE DIDN'T SAY 2 WORDS
DURING SUPPER.

43:07.211 --> 43:09.880
CAROLINE, THERE'S NO LAW
AGAINST BEING QUIET.

43:10.047 --> 43:13.717
IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THE WIDOW SNIDER.

43:13.884 --> 43:15.719
I TOLD YOU HOW SHE WAS
IN TOWN TODAY.

43:15.886 --> 43:17.304
SEVERAL TIMES.

43:19.473 --> 43:21.517
I'M GOING
TO TALK TO HIM.

43:21.684 --> 43:23.519
CAROLINE, IF HE WANTED US
TO KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG,

43:23.686 --> 43:25.354
HE WOULD HAVE TOLD US.

43:25.521 --> 43:28.315
CHARLES,
I FEEL RESPONSIBLE.

43:28.482 --> 43:30.484
I'VE GOT
TO TALK TO HIM.

43:50.254 --> 43:51.839
OH, MRS. INGALLS.

43:52.006 --> 43:53.674
I HOPE I'M NOT
DISTURBING YOU.

43:53.841 --> 43:56.969
OH, NO, NO, NOT AT ALL.
COME ON UP.

43:59.930 --> 44:02.224
SURE AM
A SLOPPY PACKER.

44:02.391 --> 44:05.602
WELL, THEN,
I GUESS MOST MEN ARE.

44:06.770 --> 44:08.063
YOU'RE LEAVING US?

44:08.230 --> 44:09.648
YES, MA'AM,

44:09.815 --> 44:11.525
IN THE MORNING.

44:13.902 --> 44:16.030
I HOPED
YOU'D BE HAPPY HERE.

44:16.196 --> 44:18.699
OH, HAVE BEEN, MA'AM.
HAVE BEEN.

44:18.866 --> 44:22.161
YOU KNOW, BEING HERE
WITH YOU FOLKS IS...

44:22.328 --> 44:25.164
THEN THERE'S WALNUT GROVE,
YOU KNOW--NO SALOON.

44:25.331 --> 44:29.835
TOWN AIN'T NO TOWN AT ALL
WITHOUT A SALOON.

44:30.002 --> 44:33.714
AND I'M NOT ONE FOR STAYING IN
ONE PLACE VERY LONG, YOU KNOW.

44:33.881 --> 44:36.050
LIKE TO BE ON THE MOVE.

44:37.426 --> 44:40.054
I SAW GRACE TODAY.

44:48.771 --> 44:52.149
I REALLY TOOK TO THAT WOMAN.
DON'T MIND ADMITTING IT.

44:52.316 --> 44:57.488
WELL, WE JUST PUT STORE
IN DIFFERENT THINGS IS ALL.

44:57.654 --> 45:02.659
I MEAN, I COULDN'T LIVE HER KIND OF LIFE.
I'D FEEL LIKE A HYPOCRITE.

45:02.826 --> 45:05.037
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU MEAN.

45:05.204 --> 45:07.247
WELL, SHE'S
A GOD-FEARING PERSON.

45:07.414 --> 45:09.500
I'M NOT.
JUST AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

45:09.666 --> 45:11.543
OH, I AIN'T SAYING
THERE AIN'T NO GOD.

45:11.710 --> 45:14.171
IT'S JUST, I'M SAYING HE AIN'T
NEVER HAD NO TIME FOR ME,

45:14.338 --> 45:16.423
SO I AIN'T GOT
NO TIME FOR HIM.

45:16.590 --> 45:17.925
DO YOU BELIEVE
IN ANYTHING?

45:18.092 --> 45:21.178
YES, MA'AM.
I BELIEVE IN ME.

45:23.347 --> 45:26.600
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH
FOR THE WIDOW SNIDER.

45:28.894 --> 45:30.938
IS IT ENOUGH FOR YOU?

45:31.855 --> 45:34.608
YOU TELL ME
SOMETHING, MA'AM.

45:34.775 --> 45:40.406
YOU TELL ME WHY GOD
LET MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER DIE.

45:46.995 --> 45:49.039
WELL...

45:49.206 --> 45:54.294
I'LL, UH, I'LL BE GONE BY THE TIME
YOU GET BACK FROM CHURCH TOMORROW.

45:54.461 --> 45:55.921
HATE GOOD-BYES,

45:56.088 --> 45:59.216
SO IT'S BETTER ALL THE WAY
AROUND IF I'M JUST GONE.

45:59.383 --> 46:02.636
MR. EDWARDS, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

46:04.430 --> 46:08.308
YOU'RE PUNISHING GOD,

46:08.475 --> 46:12.604
AND IF YOU GO ON PUNISHING HIM
FOR WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST,

46:12.771 --> 46:16.608
YOU AREN'T GOING TO HAVE
ANY ROOM FOR THE FUTURE.

46:20.904 --> 46:25.117
OH, I'D BE SO SORRY
IF YOU DID THAT.

46:36.920 --> 46:38.130
GOOD-BYE.

46:53.854 --> 46:57.566
OLD DAN TUCKER
WAS A FINE OLD MAN...

46:58.859 --> 47:02.070
WASHED HIS FACE
IN A FRYING PAN...

47:03.864 --> 47:08.911
COMBED HIS HAIR
WITH A WAGON WHEEL...

47:09.077 --> 47:11.914
DIED WITH A TOOTHACHE
IN HIS HEEL.
