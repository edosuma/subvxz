01:51.941 --> 01:53.861
My name is Mary Lennox.

01:54.262 --> 01:56.021
I was born in India.

01:56.182 --> 01:58.261
It was hot...and strange...

01:59.021 --> 02:00.821
...and lonely in India.

02:00.941 --> 02:02.581
I didn't like it.

02:03.061 --> 02:04.941
Nobody but my servant...

02:05.061 --> 02:07.221
...my ayah, looked after me.

02:07.941 --> 02:09.941
My parents didn't want me.

02:10.021 --> 02:12.661
My mother cared only to go to parties...

02:13.021 --> 02:16.141
...and my fa ther was busy
with his military duties.

02:16.581 --> 02:19.381
I was never allowed to go to the parties.

02:19.541 --> 02:22.141
I watched them
from my mother's bedroom window.

02:22.461 --> 02:24.741
I was angry, but I never cried.

02:26.101 --> 02:28.061
I didn't know how to cry.

03:16.981 --> 03:20.461
-I left my fan. You didn't have to come.
-I wanted to.

03:20.821 --> 03:23.661
My parents always thought
about themselves.

03:24.061 --> 03:26.061
They never thought about me.

03:26.541 --> 03:28.101
If only I could've known...

03:28.181 --> 03:31.101
...that in a few moments
I would lose them forever.

03:39.501 --> 03:40.861
Earthquake!

04:32.341 --> 04:36.222
The families of the Indian earthquake
orphans should please go to Dock 2.

04:41.261 --> 04:43.902
We're here, Mary! Can you believe it?

04:44.501 --> 04:48.621
She's so sour. I heard that she never cried
when her parents died.

04:48.781 --> 04:51.061
'"Mistress Mary, quite contrary....'"

05:00.461 --> 05:02.221
Numbers 38 and 39...

05:03.341 --> 05:05.302
...George and Amy Brent.

05:07.421 --> 05:09.181
Numbers 40 and 41...

05:09.861 --> 05:11.981
...Timothy and Thomas Burke.

05:12.781 --> 05:14.541
-Here we are!
-Here we are!

05:15.981 --> 05:17.701
Oh, my boys, my boys.

05:30.701 --> 05:32.621
Number 43, Mary Lennox.

05:34.221 --> 05:36.301
'"Mary, Mary, quite contrary

05:37.901 --> 05:39.941
'"How does your garden grow?

05:41.061 --> 05:42.742
'"With silver bells

05:43.181 --> 05:44.821
'"And cockleshells

05:45.141 --> 05:47.421
'"And pretty maids all in a row.'"

05:54.861 --> 05:56.261
Number 43...

05:57.861 --> 05:59.381
...Mary Lennox.

06:02.541 --> 06:04.501
Please, just step aside.

06:12.261 --> 06:13.661
Number 44...

06:13.901 --> 06:15.341
...Adam Snow.

06:38.621 --> 06:40.021
Mary Lennox?

06:42.662 --> 06:44.421
Is that Mary Lennox?

06:44.582 --> 06:45.861
Number 43.

06:46.901 --> 06:48.341
Yes, Mary Lennox.

06:48.422 --> 06:50.101
I've come to claim her.

06:50.261 --> 06:53.741
I'm Mrs. Medlock,
housekeeper of Misslethwaite Manor...

06:55.341 --> 06:57.101
...for the Lord Archibald Craven...

06:57.181 --> 06:58.861
...her uncle and guardian.

06:58.941 --> 07:01.701
What a queer, unresponsive little thing.

07:02.142 --> 07:04.781
And, my word, a plain piece of quince.

07:05.461 --> 07:06.861
Her mother was a beauty.

07:06.942 --> 07:09.421
She certainly didn't hand much of it down.

07:09.981 --> 07:11.861
She might improve as she gets older.

07:11.941 --> 07:13.461
Children change.

07:13.741 --> 07:15.981
She'll have to change quite a bit.

07:16.542 --> 07:19.821
There's not much to improve her
at Misslethwaite Manor.

07:20.261 --> 07:21.541
Come along.

07:43.101 --> 07:45.981
It's a pity for you that
you haven't any other place to go.

07:46.061 --> 07:48.502
Your uncle won't trouble himself
about you.

07:48.581 --> 07:50.181
That's for sure.

07:50.501 --> 07:52.941
He never troubles himself about anyone.

07:53.302 --> 07:55.021
As if having a crooked back...

07:55.101 --> 07:59.261
...wasn't cross enough for a man to bear,
but she had to up and die on him.

08:00.341 --> 08:03.381
Your aunt is dead.
Didn't your mother tell you?

08:04.621 --> 08:05.861
Strange.

08:06.541 --> 08:08.981
Not telling you that
her own twin sister was dead.

08:09.062 --> 08:12.222
My mother didn't have the time
to tell me stories.

08:39.900 --> 08:41.302
Oh, at last.

08:45.422 --> 08:46.981
There's Misslethwaite.

08:48.781 --> 08:51.501
You'll go straight to bed for a few hours.

08:51.582 --> 08:53.821
You probably haven't gotten much rest.

09:30.221 --> 09:31.381
There's your breakfast.

09:31.461 --> 09:33.501
I'm still in my nightgown.

09:33.981 --> 09:37.621
You can change after you eat.
There are new clothes in the wardrobe.

09:37.701 --> 09:39.141
Who'll dress me?

09:42.221 --> 09:43.381
You can't dress yourself?

09:43.461 --> 09:45.701
Of course not. My ayah dressed me.

09:45.781 --> 09:47.061
Nonsense.

09:48.222 --> 09:49.901
As old as you are?

09:49.981 --> 09:53.302
What do they do with children in India?
Carry you around in a basket?

09:53.381 --> 09:56.061
How dare you talk to me
with such disrespect!

09:57.741 --> 10:00.461
Nobody's going to carry you
around Misslethwaite Manor.

10:00.541 --> 10:02.781
We've far too much work already.

10:04.101 --> 10:06.182
So you'll have to look after yourself.

10:06.261 --> 10:09.421
There are 100 rooms here.
This one and no other is yours.

10:09.661 --> 10:13.021
Don't expect to see your uncle
because it's certain you won't.

10:15.021 --> 10:18.981
You are not to touch anything,
or to go wandering and poking about.

12:29.741 --> 12:31.422
The house seemed dead...

12:31.581 --> 12:34.061
...like a spell had been cast upon it.

13:44.061 --> 13:46.461
It lookedjust like my mother's room.

13:47.262 --> 13:49.341
This must have been my aunt's.

13:50.181 --> 13:52.301
The dressing tables were the same.

13:53.022 --> 13:55.501
They even had twin ivory elephants.

14:05.541 --> 14:06.501
Mother.

15:04.541 --> 15:07.341
What are you doing? What did I tell you?

15:11.062 --> 15:12.621
I heard someone crying.

15:12.702 --> 15:13.501
Dogs.

15:13.581 --> 15:15.621
No, someone! A person crying.

15:16.301 --> 15:18.541
You heard nothing of the sort.

15:27.981 --> 15:29.101
Now...

15:29.421 --> 15:32.941
...you stay where you are told,
or I'll come and box your ears.

15:50.621 --> 15:51.821
Good afternoon.

15:52.261 --> 15:54.221
I brought you something to eat.

15:55.902 --> 15:58.301
You haven't touched your porridge.

15:58.941 --> 16:00.341
Didn't you want it?

16:01.261 --> 16:02.661
Are you my servant?

16:02.781 --> 16:04.861
I'm Mrs. Medlock's servant.

16:05.421 --> 16:07.181
She's Lord Craven's.

16:07.901 --> 16:12.301
But I'll be doing the housemaid's work
up here and waiting on you a bit.

16:12.421 --> 16:15.181
Waiting on me makes you my servant then.

16:19.341 --> 16:20.621
You are strange.

16:20.781 --> 16:22.421
Hey, I know that.

16:23.421 --> 16:27.181
Mrs. Medlock gave me the place
out of kindness to me mother.

16:28.221 --> 16:32.261
She said she could never have done it
if there was a grand missus here.

16:34.181 --> 16:36.461
I'd never be let out of the kitchens...

16:36.621 --> 16:38.861
...and certainly not upstairs.

16:39.181 --> 16:40.421
Stop it!

16:41.181 --> 16:42.262
What're you doing?

16:42.341 --> 16:45.101
I thought all girls liked to be tickled.

16:51.181 --> 16:53.341
What would you like to wear?

16:53.901 --> 16:55.101
Black...

16:55.941 --> 16:57.622
...black or black?

16:58.501 --> 16:59.981
Are you blind?

17:00.261 --> 17:01.941
They're all black.

17:04.021 --> 17:06.501
And I won't be laughed at, servant.

17:06.981 --> 17:08.621
My name's Martha.

17:11.181 --> 17:13.461
I won't tickle you. I promise.

17:20.781 --> 17:22.861
What do they wear in India?

17:23.141 --> 17:26.300
When I heard you were coming,
I thought you'd be a native.

17:28.300 --> 17:29.421
What?

17:30.061 --> 17:32.501
You thought I was a what? You....

17:33.221 --> 17:34.301
You....

17:34.461 --> 17:36.302
You daughter of a pig!

17:37.221 --> 17:40.701
You needn't be like that.
I've nothing against natives.

17:41.061 --> 17:43.221
My mother says all of us are family.

17:43.341 --> 17:44.701
I've never seen a native.

17:44.781 --> 17:46.141
I was pleased to think I was.

17:46.221 --> 17:49.701
You don't know anything about anything!
None of you know nothing!

17:56.461 --> 17:57.661
Please.

17:59.062 --> 18:00.581
Don't be vexed.

18:01.341 --> 18:03.741
I don't know anything about anything...

18:04.262 --> 18:05.901
...like you said.

18:06.861 --> 18:08.461
I'm sorry, miss.

18:08.901 --> 18:11.381
I'm too common and I talk too much.

18:12.701 --> 18:14.381
I beg your pardon, miss.

18:31.101 --> 18:34.461
I don't know when exactly
your uncle will call for you.

18:35.101 --> 18:36.381
My uncle?

18:36.621 --> 18:39.181
Mrs. Medlock said
he wouldn't want to see me.

18:41.181 --> 18:42.581
But he does.

19:09.221 --> 19:12.061
Your uncle's decided not to see you today.

19:12.301 --> 19:13.781
When will I see him?

19:13.901 --> 19:15.181
Tomorrow?

19:15.261 --> 19:17.101
No. He'll be gone tomorrow.

19:40.542 --> 19:43.181
After the mistress died ten years ago...

19:43.341 --> 19:45.701
...Lord Craven wouldn't see people.

19:45.981 --> 19:48.381
There's nobody to ease his sorrow.

19:48.621 --> 19:51.461
He spends most of his time
away from home now.

19:51.821 --> 19:53.101
Poor man.

19:53.181 --> 19:54.662
They say he's cursed.

19:56.541 --> 19:59.421
Better put your sweater on.
It's cold outside.

19:59.541 --> 20:01.621
But I've got no one to play with.

20:01.821 --> 20:03.541
No one to play with?

20:04.061 --> 20:05.301
Let me out of here.

20:05.381 --> 20:07.142
Dickon, my brother...

20:07.301 --> 20:10.181
...goes up on the moor
by himself for hours.

20:11.621 --> 20:14.741
That's how he made friends
with all his animals.

20:15.141 --> 20:16.221
Who?

20:16.581 --> 20:17.861
Dickon...

20:18.181 --> 20:19.661
...me younger brother.

20:19.741 --> 20:20.661
Pull it down!

20:20.741 --> 20:23.301
You have no idea
how curious he is about you.

20:23.781 --> 20:25.741
What do you think you're doing?

20:25.821 --> 20:27.261
There you are!

20:27.501 --> 20:29.381
I wondered where you'd gone.

20:29.701 --> 20:32.581
What do you mean?
You knew perfectly well where I was.

20:32.662 --> 20:34.302
Your scarf, miss.

20:38.101 --> 20:39.221
There.

20:40.701 --> 20:42.621
Thou is ready to go out now.

20:42.942 --> 20:44.341
I can't see.

20:57.861 --> 20:59.822
To get to the gardens...

21:00.261 --> 21:02.422
...you must go through there...

21:02.741 --> 21:05.141
...then around the outside of the house.

21:05.621 --> 21:07.622
Run along now. Have fun.

22:23.301 --> 22:24.901
What's beyond there?

22:25.861 --> 22:27.381
Another garden?

22:33.901 --> 22:35.381
Where's the door?

22:55.702 --> 22:56.981
You there!

23:05.061 --> 23:07.622
-Where's the door to that other garden?
-What?

23:08.341 --> 23:11.341
The one with all the ivy.
I didn't see a door.

23:11.701 --> 23:12.821
There isn't one.

23:12.901 --> 23:14.701
There has to be a door somewhere.

23:14.781 --> 23:17.782
No one's been inside that place
for ten years.

23:18.062 --> 23:19.021
Why?

23:19.101 --> 23:20.102
Why?

23:20.821 --> 23:24.861
Because when she died, the master
gave orders to shut it up forever.

23:25.061 --> 23:26.341
Who died?

23:29.702 --> 23:31.141
My aunt died.

23:34.061 --> 23:36.181
It was her garden, wasn't it?

23:37.621 --> 23:38.902
Look at me.

23:39.981 --> 23:41.502
Answer me, you!

23:42.742 --> 23:45.541
It's revolting how these people
behave toward me.

23:48.861 --> 23:50.101
Of course...

23:50.181 --> 23:52.421
...orders couldn't keep him out.

23:54.701 --> 23:57.501
He's the only one goes in there nowadays.

24:04.262 --> 24:05.782
If you know the way...

24:05.861 --> 24:07.101
...show me.

24:15.821 --> 24:17.101
Who's there?

24:39.261 --> 24:40.661
He hates it.

24:40.821 --> 24:43.061
Why does Lord Craven hate her garden?

24:43.261 --> 24:45.861
-We're not supposed to talk about it.
-Why not?

24:46.021 --> 24:47.941
I've got a present for you.

24:49.221 --> 24:51.261
Mother sent it over to you.

24:54.061 --> 24:55.021
What's it for?

24:55.101 --> 24:58.582
You mean, all they've got is
elephants and tigers in India?

24:58.861 --> 25:01.141
They've not got skipping ropes?

25:02.501 --> 25:03.782
Come here.

25:04.581 --> 25:05.741
Watch.

25:14.661 --> 25:16.101
Now, you try.

25:43.061 --> 25:45.181
Thank you, Martha. Thank your mother.

25:45.261 --> 25:46.861
You are strange.

25:47.661 --> 25:49.661
If you'd been any other child...

25:49.741 --> 25:53.061
-...you'd have given me a kiss.
-Do you want me to kiss you?

25:55.021 --> 25:56.021
What's that?

25:56.101 --> 25:57.781
Go on now, Miss Mary.

25:59.062 --> 26:00.261
Go, go.

26:02.661 --> 26:04.381
I've never skipped before.

26:05.782 --> 26:07.301
Well, he's impressed.

26:08.181 --> 26:10.661
Cheeky little beggar. Look at him.

26:11.741 --> 26:13.021
What about him?

26:13.141 --> 26:14.981
I can't think why, but...

26:15.301 --> 26:17.781
...he's decided to make friends with thee.

26:19.661 --> 26:20.862
He has?

26:22.661 --> 26:24.422
I've never had any friends.

26:24.901 --> 26:26.342
That I believe.

26:29.661 --> 26:30.901
Show me.

26:31.221 --> 26:32.941
Please show me the way in.

27:27.461 --> 27:28.821
Thank you, robin.

27:42.821 --> 27:44.662
I need more.... Martha!

27:45.221 --> 27:47.701
I need more plasters! More towels!

30:27.862 --> 30:30.501
Did you see what I found, pretty robin?

31:17.461 --> 31:20.382
You're getting on well enough
with that this morning.

31:20.461 --> 31:21.861
Tastes nice today.

31:23.901 --> 31:25.021
Listen.

31:26.822 --> 31:28.101
Hear that?

31:28.742 --> 31:30.181
It's the wind.

31:31.181 --> 31:34.341
Sometimes it sounds like
someone's lost out in the moor...

31:34.741 --> 31:36.221
...and crying.

31:39.261 --> 31:41.301
Poor little Betty Butterworth...

31:41.901 --> 31:43.541
...the scullery maid.

31:43.781 --> 31:45.981
She's had a toothache all morning.

31:46.101 --> 31:49.182
I need your help. Come on.
Get this child outside at once!

31:49.261 --> 31:50.901
Come on, Martha, please!

32:02.101 --> 32:03.221
Soot.

32:05.821 --> 32:07.581
He doesn't know thee. You frightened him.

32:07.661 --> 32:09.301
I frightened him?

32:09.541 --> 32:10.421
Come.

32:10.501 --> 32:11.942
He won't hurt you.

32:12.981 --> 32:14.981
-He'll bite me.
-He won't.

32:15.701 --> 32:17.141
But he's filthy and dirty.

32:17.221 --> 32:19.501
No, he's soft. You'll like it.

32:23.381 --> 32:24.982
There. I did it.

32:41.061 --> 32:42.621
Like that, Miss Mary.

32:43.061 --> 32:45.822
I know you, too.
You're Martha's brother, Dickon.

32:59.181 --> 33:01.381
The robin says he's been waiting for you.

33:01.462 --> 33:03.661
The animals tell me all their secrets.

33:03.741 --> 33:05.581
He wouldn't tell you my secret.

33:05.661 --> 33:07.461
About what, Miss Mary?

33:09.142 --> 33:10.421
A garden.

33:10.941 --> 33:12.501
I've stolen a garden.

33:13.141 --> 33:14.541
Maybe it's dead, anyhow.

33:14.622 --> 33:16.461
-I don't know.
-I'd know.

33:21.221 --> 33:22.861
Promise you won't tell?

33:22.941 --> 33:24.181
Promise.

33:24.581 --> 33:25.701
Nobody?

33:25.821 --> 33:26.981
Not a soul.

33:27.541 --> 33:29.302
It's a secret garden.

33:29.621 --> 33:31.301
Secrets are safe with me.

33:34.581 --> 33:37.341
-And you'll know if it's alive?
-'Course.

33:38.941 --> 33:40.061
Wait here.

33:59.742 --> 34:01.382
This garden's not dead.

34:01.781 --> 34:03.541
It's as alive as you or me.

34:05.581 --> 34:07.501
See? This part's wick.

34:07.941 --> 34:09.221
See the green?

34:09.741 --> 34:10.862
Wick?

34:11.061 --> 34:12.261
What's wick?

34:12.541 --> 34:13.621
Alive.

34:13.701 --> 34:14.900
Full of life.

34:16.101 --> 34:18.741
There'll be so many roses
in there this summer...

34:18.821 --> 34:20.541
...you'll be sick of them.

34:20.940 --> 34:22.061
Look!

34:31.702 --> 34:34.581
There's a picture of my mother
and my aunt sitting here.

34:34.661 --> 34:36.502
They say that's how she died.

34:36.581 --> 34:37.661
How?

34:38.061 --> 34:39.541
From falling off it.

34:59.381 --> 35:01.941
For the first time since coming from India...

35:02.301 --> 35:04.181
...I dreamed about my mother.

35:04.901 --> 35:06.141
She was here...

35:06.461 --> 35:07.902
...in the garden...

35:08.221 --> 35:10.141
...and the garden was ajungle.

35:11.301 --> 35:12.661
Come to me.

37:13.382 --> 37:14.781
Are you a ghost?

37:17.461 --> 37:18.701
Are you?

37:20.741 --> 37:22.141
Who are you?

37:22.501 --> 37:24.101
What are you doing here?

37:24.581 --> 37:25.862
I live here.

37:26.341 --> 37:27.382
Who are you?

37:27.461 --> 37:30.061
I'm master of this house,
while my father's away.

37:30.141 --> 37:31.541
Your father?

37:32.501 --> 37:33.861
He's my uncle.

37:34.021 --> 37:36.141
Nobody told me he had a son.

37:36.302 --> 37:37.581
Come here.

38:04.901 --> 38:06.301
What's your name?

38:07.142 --> 38:08.741
I'm Mary Lennox.

38:09.461 --> 38:10.821
What's your name?

38:10.941 --> 38:12.222
I'm Colin Craven.

38:12.301 --> 38:14.741
Our mother's were sisters. Twins.

38:14.901 --> 38:16.062
Twins?

38:17.221 --> 38:19.301
Nobody told me she had a twin.

38:20.741 --> 38:23.221
-Why were you crying?
-I can't sleep.

38:24.261 --> 38:26.861
Plump my pillows for me, Cousin Mary.

38:27.741 --> 38:29.341
-What?
-My pillows.

38:30.021 --> 38:31.741
My covers got twisted.

38:33.501 --> 38:35.781
I don't know what to do about it.

38:36.341 --> 38:38.621
-I'll get Martha, or Mrs. Medlock.
-No!

38:40.461 --> 38:41.661
Why not?

38:43.101 --> 38:45.221
Medlock wouldn't allow you in here.

38:46.861 --> 38:48.901
She'd be afraid you'd upset me...

38:50.301 --> 38:51.941
...and make me more ill.

38:52.101 --> 38:53.941
-Do I? I'll go.
-Stop!

38:54.421 --> 38:55.702
Stay here!

38:56.181 --> 38:57.701
How old are you?

38:58.101 --> 38:59.061
Ten.

38:59.981 --> 39:01.381
We're the same age.

39:03.382 --> 39:04.981
What's your mother like?

39:07.061 --> 39:08.261
She's dead.

39:09.101 --> 39:10.502
Mine's dead, too.

39:12.101 --> 39:13.621
Do you see that cord?

39:14.741 --> 39:15.862
Pull it.

39:24.981 --> 39:26.422
That's my mother.

39:26.661 --> 39:29.061
My father never wants to see me
because...

39:30.381 --> 39:32.381
...I don't look anything like her.

39:32.461 --> 39:34.181
But you, you look like her.

39:36.861 --> 39:38.981
Why do you keep a curtain over her?

39:39.261 --> 39:40.661
She smiles too much.

39:40.741 --> 39:42.341
Smiles too much?

39:42.981 --> 39:45.261
How can anybody smile too much?

39:46.582 --> 39:48.101
Sometimes I hate her.

39:48.621 --> 39:51.701
-She died when I was born.
-I thought she died in her garden.

39:51.782 --> 39:52.981
Garden?

39:53.381 --> 39:54.501
What garden?

39:54.821 --> 39:56.261
Oh, just a garden.

39:56.341 --> 39:58.261
There are so many of them here.

39:58.341 --> 39:59.861
-Are there?
-Of course.

40:00.061 --> 40:01.301
Don't you go outside?

40:01.382 --> 40:02.342
Never.

40:02.501 --> 40:03.862
What's wrong with you?

40:03.941 --> 40:05.301
I'm going to die.

40:05.701 --> 40:06.821
From what?

40:07.181 --> 40:08.341
Everything.

40:08.501 --> 40:10.421
I've spent my whole life in this bed.

40:10.501 --> 40:12.261
You don't know how to walk?

40:12.581 --> 40:13.862
You are real?

40:14.822 --> 40:16.781
My dreams are so real sometimes.

40:16.861 --> 40:18.781
Shall I pinch you to prove it?

40:24.941 --> 40:26.021
See?

41:15.941 --> 41:17.861
How did you know to pull the weeds?

41:17.941 --> 41:21.501
It looked like it was strangling.
I don't even know what it is.

41:21.781 --> 41:24.341
A lily. It's an Empress-of-India lily.

41:24.421 --> 41:25.741
Empress of India?

41:25.821 --> 41:27.621
These bulbs are lilies, too.

41:29.061 --> 41:31.421
We'll plant them all around your lily.

41:31.501 --> 41:33.461
She'll have her own ladies in waiting.

41:33.542 --> 41:34.901
It's just like the rhyme:

41:34.981 --> 41:37.141
'"Mistress Mary, quite contrary

41:37.221 --> 41:39.141
'"How does your garden grow?

41:39.261 --> 41:40.941
'"With silver bells and cockleshells

41:41.021 --> 41:42.981
'"And pretty maids all in a row.'"

41:45.021 --> 41:48.701
On the boat coming here,
they used to sing that song at me.

41:50.422 --> 41:52.501
I wasn't as contrary as they were.

42:00.022 --> 42:01.861
I met my cousin last night.

42:03.141 --> 42:04.741
You've seen Colin?

42:05.301 --> 42:06.941
Did you know about him?

42:07.301 --> 42:09.342
Everybody knows about him.

42:09.421 --> 42:11.341
But hardly anybody's seen him.

42:11.542 --> 42:14.101
He said his mother died when he was born.

42:14.661 --> 42:16.062
She fell off the swing.

42:16.141 --> 42:17.381
He was born too soon.

42:17.461 --> 42:19.222
He's not at all like you.

42:19.622 --> 42:22.102
His cheeks are whiter than ice and marble.

42:22.941 --> 42:24.661
Whiter than these little hairs.

42:24.741 --> 42:26.181
Those are the roots.

42:26.661 --> 42:28.101
Set it in there.

42:37.462 --> 42:39.541
Let it grow this way, Miss Mary.

42:56.821 --> 42:58.861
How tiresome to be shut indoors.

42:59.301 --> 43:00.741
It's too stuffy!

43:01.821 --> 43:05.061
I'll faint if I don't get
some light and fresh air.

43:07.301 --> 43:09.381
At least we can open the windows.

43:10.741 --> 43:12.581
No, get away from there!

43:12.661 --> 43:14.021
Don't touch them.

43:14.181 --> 43:15.621
They're nailed shut.

43:15.701 --> 43:17.901
My lungs can't take the spores.

43:18.101 --> 43:19.061
Spores?

43:19.142 --> 43:22.821
The wind carries them. When you
breathe the air, you swallow them.

43:22.901 --> 43:24.381
They get stuck in your lungs.

43:24.461 --> 43:28.062
Before I got out into the wind,
even my hair was scrawny.

43:28.261 --> 43:29.581
Your hair?

43:29.821 --> 43:32.061
-Hair is dead.
-If hair is dead...

43:32.261 --> 43:35.221
...then how come it keeps growing
even after you die?

43:35.621 --> 43:38.981
Well, maybe not your hair!
By then you might be bald.

43:39.302 --> 43:40.901
Don't be stupid.

43:41.381 --> 43:43.981
I'll be dead before I'm old enough
to be bald.

43:44.261 --> 43:46.741
I'll get a lump on my back like my father.

43:46.901 --> 43:48.261
Then I'll die.

43:49.862 --> 43:51.901
I hate how you talk about dying.

43:52.541 --> 43:53.941
Everyone thinks I'll die.

43:54.021 --> 43:57.221
If everyone thought that about me,
I wouldn't do it.

43:58.541 --> 43:59.501
Here.

43:59.661 --> 44:00.781
Put this on.

44:00.901 --> 44:03.541
Everyone has to wear one.
Medlock's orders.

44:03.821 --> 44:06.621
-But she's not here to see me.
-Put it on.

44:10.341 --> 44:12.181
It makes my face itch.

44:13.381 --> 44:16.981
I can't stand it!
I didn't give you any germs last night!

44:18.262 --> 44:19.861
Put on the mask.

44:20.501 --> 44:24.941
Stop talking to me as if you were a rajah
with jewels stuck all over you.

44:25.221 --> 44:27.302
I'll talk to you any way I please.

44:28.781 --> 44:30.021
Where are you going?

44:30.101 --> 44:32.102
Back outside to be with Dickon.

44:32.901 --> 44:35.661
He tames animals like the animal charmers
in India.

44:35.741 --> 44:38.101
He knows everything about gardens.

44:38.181 --> 44:40.421
Does he know about my mother's garden?

44:40.701 --> 44:43.021
-What?
-You said my mother had a garden.

44:43.101 --> 44:46.381
How would he know about it?
It's locked. No one's allowed in there.

44:46.461 --> 44:48.621
-I'll make them unlock it.
-No, don't do that.

44:48.702 --> 44:49.942
Why not?

44:50.541 --> 44:53.981
If you make them open the door like that,
if everyone knows...

44:54.101 --> 44:56.261
...it wouldn't be a secret anymore.

44:56.461 --> 44:59.461
Don't you see how much better it is
if it's a secret?

45:00.101 --> 45:03.181
You have to.
Maybe you can't even keep a secret.

45:10.021 --> 45:12.982
Master Colin, we've brought the machine
for your legs.

45:13.141 --> 45:14.261
I don't want it.

45:14.342 --> 45:16.262
Now, don't be like that.

45:16.421 --> 45:19.621
You know how important it is
for your circulation.

45:23.141 --> 45:25.862
I've got some nice, fresh flannels, too.

45:46.501 --> 45:48.141
Your father returns today.

45:48.222 --> 45:49.821
He won't want to see me.

45:50.181 --> 45:51.782
Perhaps he will.

46:01.181 --> 46:03.341
The machine. Wake up, girl!

46:08.821 --> 46:10.661
Oh, I forgot my herbs.

46:11.021 --> 46:12.821
-I'll get them for you.
-No, thank you.

46:12.902 --> 46:16.421
Last time, you brought too many roots
and almost no leaves.

46:20.621 --> 46:23.381
What are you doing down there,
Miss Mary?

46:25.221 --> 46:26.581
Where's your mask?

46:27.021 --> 46:29.222
If Mrs. Medlock finds out....

46:29.541 --> 46:31.461
The world's coming to an end.

46:31.541 --> 46:32.981
She won't let you come back.

46:33.062 --> 46:36.502
But you're master until your father
gets home, you could make her--

46:36.581 --> 46:38.021
Go! Just go!

46:38.661 --> 46:40.541
She'll think I disobeyed her.

46:40.781 --> 46:42.461
She'll fire me for sure.

46:42.981 --> 46:44.381
Please! Go!

46:54.981 --> 46:57.461
His Lordship's arrived! He's here!

47:20.382 --> 47:22.181
Come along, Miss Mary.

47:30.101 --> 47:31.301
Come along.

47:49.221 --> 47:50.981
Miss Mary, Your Lordship.

47:59.941 --> 48:01.061
Calm down.

48:08.541 --> 48:09.781
Come here.

48:18.901 --> 48:20.582
You needn't be afraid.

48:21.381 --> 48:22.502
Come here.

48:36.181 --> 48:37.381
My God!

48:42.181 --> 48:43.301
Your eyes!

48:43.941 --> 48:45.542
They're so much....

48:47.781 --> 48:49.261
I had no idea.

48:54.182 --> 48:55.621
Wait a moment.

49:05.181 --> 49:06.942
They never sent me your picture.

49:07.021 --> 49:09.621
Mother had no time
to get my picture taken.

49:24.502 --> 49:28.101
Medlock wants me to send you
to some sort of boarding school.

49:29.581 --> 49:31.381
Please. Let me stay.

49:32.182 --> 49:33.581
I don't do any harm.

49:33.661 --> 49:34.782
Harm?

49:37.621 --> 49:39.461
What harm could you do?

49:42.341 --> 49:44.341
There's nothing for a child here.

49:44.421 --> 49:45.941
I don't need much.

49:47.542 --> 49:49.061
All I need is....

49:51.621 --> 49:52.821
Could I...?

49:54.341 --> 49:56.021
Could I have a bit of earth?

49:56.101 --> 49:57.181
Bit of earth?

49:57.261 --> 49:58.821
To plant seeds in.

49:59.101 --> 50:00.861
To make things grow.

50:10.901 --> 50:12.741
Take your bit of earth.

50:15.102 --> 50:17.621
Don't be foolish and expect anything
to come of it.

50:17.702 --> 50:20.341
May I take it from anywhere
so long as it's not wanted?

50:20.421 --> 50:21.701
Anywhere!

50:25.061 --> 50:26.741
Well.... Go! Go!

50:27.181 --> 50:28.341
You can go.

50:29.301 --> 50:31.061
Good-bye. Good-bye.

50:32.102 --> 50:33.981
I'll be away until the winter.

50:45.101 --> 50:46.181
He said I can!

50:46.261 --> 50:47.861
I can have my bit of earth!

50:47.941 --> 50:48.861
Who said?

50:48.941 --> 50:53.541
My uncle. I asked him and he said '"yes.'"
I can plant seeds anywhere I like.

50:54.541 --> 50:56.501
Blue flowers, pink flowers...

50:56.581 --> 50:58.421
...purple flowers, yellow flowers...

50:58.501 --> 51:01.381
...cornflowers, foxgloves,
any kind we want.

51:04.581 --> 51:06.021
It's raining.

51:15.541 --> 51:17.782
The rain will help our flowers grow.

51:24.421 --> 51:27.901
In India when it rained,
my ayah would tell me stories.

51:29.181 --> 51:32.941
In one of the stories there was a god
who reminds me of you.

51:33.261 --> 51:34.741
When he was growing up...

51:34.821 --> 51:38.301
...he had to be kept a secret,
so no one would see him.

51:38.581 --> 51:39.781
Really?

51:41.701 --> 51:44.181
-Why?
-Because his uncle wanted to kill him.

51:45.381 --> 51:48.421
His uncle dreamed the young god
would take over heaven.

51:48.981 --> 51:51.541
-Where did he hide?
-He lived with some cows.

51:55.141 --> 51:57.221
Was he different from other people?

51:57.341 --> 51:59.062
Only on the inside.

51:59.221 --> 52:02.181
When you looked down his throat
you could see the universe.

52:02.261 --> 52:05.101
The universe couldn't fit
down anybody's throat.

52:05.301 --> 52:06.901
Down his it could.

52:07.341 --> 52:08.421
How?

52:09.021 --> 52:13.462
He'd have to be bigger than the whole
universe to fit it down his throat.

52:13.701 --> 52:17.141
You said he looked like everybody else
on the outside.

52:17.541 --> 52:20.261
That's right. It's inside
that he was different.

52:20.741 --> 52:23.781
-It doesn't make sense.
-It doesn't have to make sense.

52:24.181 --> 52:25.581
It's the idea of it.

52:25.662 --> 52:27.141
It's so stupid.

52:27.302 --> 52:30.621
-No, it's not. It's magic.
-You can't be that stupid.

52:30.742 --> 52:32.181
I am not stupid!

52:32.581 --> 52:35.021
You don't understand. You don't want to!

52:35.781 --> 52:36.981
You can't leave!

52:37.061 --> 52:38.501
You wouldn't dare!

52:38.621 --> 52:39.821
Wouldn't I?

52:39.941 --> 52:43.061
-I'll have them drag you back in.
-Will you, Mr. Rajah?

52:44.101 --> 52:45.101
Fine.

52:45.221 --> 52:46.861
That's just fine.

52:47.621 --> 52:49.301
Then I won't even look at you.

52:49.382 --> 52:51.341
I'll stare at the floor.

52:51.661 --> 52:55.142
I'll clench my teeth together
and never tell you one thing.

52:55.341 --> 52:57.141
Not even about seeing your father.

52:57.221 --> 52:58.501
Yes, you will.

52:59.061 --> 53:00.181
Tell me.

53:03.141 --> 53:04.901
He didn't come to see me.

53:05.461 --> 53:07.181
I'll die 'cause he doesn't like me.

53:07.261 --> 53:08.381
He likes me.

53:08.582 --> 53:09.981
But he's my father!

53:10.141 --> 53:11.701
Maybe if you weren't so rude.

53:11.781 --> 53:13.061
I'm not rude!

53:13.621 --> 53:15.862
Yes, you are! You're so sour!

53:16.421 --> 53:19.501
You won't even open your windows
and let the sunshine in.

53:19.581 --> 53:21.622
How can I? It's raining out.

53:21.781 --> 53:25.061
-Even if it weren't raining.
-If it weren't raining, maybe I would.

53:25.141 --> 53:27.782
-You never have.
-Does that mean I never would?

53:27.861 --> 53:29.302
I'm not sour.

53:35.621 --> 53:37.541
Will he ever see Colin?

53:38.101 --> 53:42.141
-He's afraid to fall in love with him.
-He's afraid to love his son?

53:42.261 --> 53:45.581
Sometimes when he's here,
he stays alone for a week.

53:48.261 --> 53:50.341
But Colin wants to see him.

53:51.661 --> 53:53.741
Sometimes, he stays longer.

53:55.341 --> 53:57.021
Longer than a week?

53:58.061 --> 53:59.141
Ten years ago...

53:59.221 --> 54:02.581
...when his wife died,
he locked himself in for over a month.

54:03.302 --> 54:06.621
Colin was such a weak baby,
everyone thought he'd die.

54:06.821 --> 54:11.221
His father couldn't bear losing him, too.
He'd suffered so much already.

54:46.021 --> 54:47.701
My poor little boy.

55:08.381 --> 55:12.661
That was the night the rain stopped,
the night spring came to Misslethwaite.

55:15.781 --> 55:17.782
My poor uncle fled from it...

55:18.021 --> 55:20.261
...as if he were escaping the spring.

56:55.061 --> 56:56.301
Medlock's gone!

56:56.382 --> 56:58.982
It's working. It's working any minute now.

57:02.181 --> 57:03.382
Hold, Dickon!

57:03.461 --> 57:05.221
Hold! It's working!

57:05.781 --> 57:07.741
Come down! We need a hand.

57:09.981 --> 57:12.422
It's beautiful, Colin. Do you feel it?

57:12.661 --> 57:13.861
Do you?

57:16.941 --> 57:18.301
I'm coming!

57:25.021 --> 57:27.701
What about the spores?
Can you see them?

57:54.981 --> 57:56.141
Jesus.

57:56.741 --> 57:58.541
Come help me, please.

58:04.181 --> 58:05.701
Put him on the bed.

58:16.901 --> 58:20.141
Calm yourself, Master Colin.
Please, just calm down!

58:20.261 --> 58:22.941
Calm down. See if Mrs. Medlock's back.

58:24.461 --> 58:25.501
Calm down!

58:25.581 --> 58:27.261
Calm down, please!

58:31.461 --> 58:34.221
Miss Mary, please, don't go in there now.

58:35.141 --> 58:38.142
He's having a dreadful fit.
Lord knows what he'll do.

58:38.221 --> 58:41.501
I don't care. He's so spoiled,
he must be stopped.

58:41.741 --> 58:43.701
Somebody's got to make him stop.

58:46.102 --> 58:48.501
Stop it, you! Stop! I hate you!

58:49.341 --> 58:51.101
Everybody hates you!

58:51.381 --> 58:54.421
You're so selfish! You're the most selfish
boy there ever was!

58:54.501 --> 58:56.461
I'm not as selfish as you are.

58:56.701 --> 58:57.901
Because I'm always ill.

58:57.981 --> 59:00.101
Nobody ill can scream like that.

59:00.222 --> 59:01.621
I'm going to die!

59:01.701 --> 59:03.382
What do you know about dying?

59:03.461 --> 59:05.901
-My mother died!
-Both my parents died!

59:06.021 --> 59:09.781
I'll get a lump on my back.
I'll get a lump like my father's!

59:25.061 --> 59:26.901
It's Master Colin! It's Master Colin!

59:26.981 --> 59:29.421
Come quickly, John. Come quickly.

59:36.982 --> 59:39.221
There's nothing but your bones
sticking out.

59:39.302 --> 59:41.341
It's because you're so skinny.

59:41.782 --> 59:43.501
What in God's name?

59:43.581 --> 59:45.941
Get away from him, beastly girl!
You'll kill him!

59:46.022 --> 59:47.581
-I won't hurt him!
-She's my cousin!

59:47.661 --> 59:49.182
Give me a hand.

59:49.781 --> 59:51.341
Hold his arms up.

59:52.661 --> 59:54.301
Martha, stop that girl!

59:54.581 --> 59:56.301
He doesn't have a lump!

59:57.261 --> 59:59.981
-You let that wretched girl in here?
-No, ma'am.

01:00:00.621 --> 01:00:01.981
You disobeyed me!

01:00:02.902 --> 01:00:05.421
You are done for.
You can hie yourself home.

01:00:05.821 --> 01:00:07.661
But I didn't tell her.

01:00:08.261 --> 01:00:09.261
What's going on?

01:00:09.342 --> 01:00:12.502
I'll send you away
if you dare think of making her go!

01:00:12.581 --> 01:00:15.741
Now, get out of here!
I want to be alone with my cousin.

01:00:16.141 --> 01:00:17.141
Beg your pardon?

01:00:17.221 --> 01:00:19.341
I'm ordering you to leave this room!

01:00:19.461 --> 01:00:20.621
Ordering me?

01:00:22.421 --> 01:00:23.462
Go!

01:00:25.141 --> 01:00:26.261
I shall.

01:00:27.061 --> 01:00:31.341
If only to prevent you from harming
yourself with this hysterical shrieking.

01:00:32.981 --> 01:00:34.661
But, I promise you....

01:00:42.581 --> 01:00:44.101
Maybe I'm not ill.

01:00:44.301 --> 01:00:45.741
I don't see how.

01:00:46.141 --> 01:00:47.621
You're just weak.

01:00:50.021 --> 01:00:52.061
Do you think I could go outside?

01:00:52.262 --> 01:00:53.461
Spores and all?

01:00:53.541 --> 01:00:55.661
I don't know anything about spores.

01:00:57.421 --> 01:00:58.982
If I went out...

01:00:59.301 --> 01:01:02.701
...maybe we could find the door
to my mother's garden.

01:01:02.981 --> 01:01:04.781
If we found the door...

01:01:05.421 --> 01:01:07.141
...we could go inside.

01:01:13.221 --> 01:01:14.501
What is it?

01:01:16.501 --> 01:01:18.261
I didn't dare tell you.

01:01:18.501 --> 01:01:21.541
I didn't because I was so afraid
I couldn't trust you.

01:01:21.861 --> 01:01:22.982
What?

01:01:24.341 --> 01:01:26.261
I've been in the secret garden.

01:01:26.501 --> 01:01:28.461
I found the key weeks ago.

01:01:28.581 --> 01:01:30.101
Go on. Tell me.

01:01:31.381 --> 01:01:34.021
When you open the door,
you can't see anything.

01:01:35.021 --> 01:01:37.141
Then you go down some stone steps.

01:01:37.901 --> 01:01:41.701
By the time you reach the bottom,
you're surrounded by flowers.

01:01:41.941 --> 01:01:43.941
Every day, new flowers open.

01:01:44.501 --> 01:01:45.901
It's like magic.

01:01:46.861 --> 01:01:48.902
Baby animals are being born.

01:02:00.181 --> 01:02:02.101
I'm going out in my chair.

01:02:03.341 --> 01:02:05.381
If the fresh air agrees with me...

01:02:05.502 --> 01:02:07.301
...I may go out every day.

01:02:07.981 --> 01:02:10.501
Not every day, surely, Master Colin.

01:02:11.621 --> 01:02:14.101
When I go, nobody is to be anywhere near.

01:02:15.141 --> 01:02:18.221
None of the staff, not a single gardener.
Is that clear?

01:02:22.821 --> 01:02:24.341
What do they say in India...

01:02:24.422 --> 01:02:26.342
...when you want people to go?

01:02:26.622 --> 01:02:27.862
You say:

01:02:28.461 --> 01:02:30.661
'"I have spoken. All depart.'"

01:02:32.941 --> 01:02:34.421
I have spoken.

01:02:34.861 --> 01:02:36.222
All depart.

01:02:38.981 --> 01:02:40.421
But remember...

01:02:40.981 --> 01:02:42.581
...this is very important.

01:02:42.662 --> 01:02:43.981
Step back.

01:02:53.861 --> 01:02:55.741
You are to stay here, Medlock.

01:02:55.941 --> 01:02:58.221
-Oh, but Master Colin--
-Stay here!

01:03:13.901 --> 01:03:16.021
Just take these stupid things off!

01:03:16.101 --> 01:03:17.861
What good are they now?

01:03:18.141 --> 01:03:19.461
Get inside.

01:03:25.061 --> 01:03:26.941
-Are these your animals?
-Yes.

01:03:34.741 --> 01:03:36.022
It's safe.

01:03:36.101 --> 01:03:38.381
Go fast, Dickon! Faster! Faster!

01:03:42.381 --> 01:03:44.341
Faster, Dickon! Faster!

01:03:47.781 --> 01:03:48.902
Faster!

01:03:51.102 --> 01:03:52.301
Faster!

01:04:00.861 --> 01:04:02.141
Here we go.

01:04:24.101 --> 01:04:25.741
Go along, Honker.

01:04:26.981 --> 01:04:28.301
I wish I could help.

01:04:28.381 --> 01:04:31.381
Don't worry. We'll have you walking
before you know it.

01:04:31.461 --> 01:04:32.781
Me? Walk?

01:04:33.901 --> 01:04:35.101
Do you think I could?

01:04:35.181 --> 01:04:37.541
You have legs like everybody else.

01:04:39.221 --> 01:04:40.541
But I never thought I--

01:04:40.621 --> 01:04:42.381
Close your eyes, Colin.

01:04:46.021 --> 01:04:47.261
Am I there?

01:04:47.341 --> 01:04:48.541
Almost.

01:04:53.141 --> 01:04:54.221
Now.

01:05:04.621 --> 01:05:05.702
Yes.

01:05:06.981 --> 01:05:08.582
I imagined this.

01:05:52.062 --> 01:05:54.421
The pond was clogged when we first came.

01:05:54.501 --> 01:05:55.701
Really?

01:06:00.781 --> 01:06:02.541
Do you see that flower?

01:06:03.621 --> 01:06:06.501
That's a cornflower. There's a robin's nest.

01:06:07.941 --> 01:06:09.861
That's where I found the Empress of India.

01:06:09.941 --> 01:06:12.341
I planted all those bulbs and seeds.

01:06:28.661 --> 01:06:30.821
I'm going to come here tomorrow.

01:06:32.581 --> 01:06:34.261
And the day after.

01:06:35.181 --> 01:06:37.061
And the day after that.

01:06:40.541 --> 01:06:41.621
See.

01:06:41.861 --> 01:06:43.981
You must pull the weeds up...

01:06:44.182 --> 01:06:46.181
...to give the flowers room.

01:06:46.661 --> 01:06:47.901
Get off.

01:06:49.942 --> 01:06:51.461
It's only a worm.

01:06:56.781 --> 01:06:58.221
It's not '"ew.'"

01:07:05.861 --> 01:07:07.661
See? He likes them, too.

01:07:20.662 --> 01:07:21.861
Who's that man?

01:07:21.981 --> 01:07:23.781
What are you doing in here?

01:07:23.861 --> 01:07:26.861
How did you get in?
You awful, little busybody!

01:07:27.141 --> 01:07:29.941
I couldn't bear you the first time
I set eyes on you.

01:07:30.021 --> 01:07:32.541
It was the robin who showed me the door.

01:07:38.821 --> 01:07:40.542
Do you know who I am?

01:07:40.661 --> 01:07:42.061
Who you are?

01:07:43.702 --> 01:07:45.021
You're the little cripple.

01:07:45.101 --> 01:07:46.741
-If he's got a lump...
-I'm not a cripple!

01:07:46.821 --> 01:07:48.541
...it's the size of a pin.

01:07:48.902 --> 01:07:50.861
-Your back's not crooked?
-No!

01:07:52.062 --> 01:07:53.901
And you haven't crooked legs?

01:07:54.662 --> 01:07:56.741
Who said I had crooked legs?

01:07:57.542 --> 01:07:59.301
No one ever said that.

01:08:22.701 --> 01:08:24.100
You can do it.

01:08:25.261 --> 01:08:26.661
You can do it.

01:08:26.981 --> 01:08:28.421
You can do it.

01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:36.341
Look at me.

01:08:36.502 --> 01:08:38.020
Just look, you.

01:08:48.581 --> 01:08:51.060
We didn't want you, but now you're here.

01:08:52.461 --> 01:08:54.621
Don't say a word about it to anyone.

01:08:55.621 --> 01:08:57.341
Send for you to help us sometimes.

01:08:57.421 --> 01:08:59.942
I've come here before,
when no one saw me.

01:09:00.301 --> 01:09:01.701
Your mother...

01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:04.020
...was so fond of this garden.

01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:06.662
She would ask me to look after her roses.

01:09:07.461 --> 01:09:09.341
She'd never ask anybody else.

01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:13.381
When she went away,
orders were no one were to come here.

01:09:13.861 --> 01:09:15.261
But I come anyway.

01:09:15.541 --> 01:09:17.221
She gave her orders first.

01:09:18.381 --> 01:09:20.621
You know how to keep a secret.

01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:22.941
Come inside. Be quick.

01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:24.461
Oh, laddie.

01:09:24.981 --> 01:09:26.981
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

01:09:27.102 --> 01:09:29.060
I'll meet him at the door.

01:09:32.741 --> 01:09:34.701
-Are you making this magic?
-No.

01:09:35.621 --> 01:09:36.541
You are.

01:09:36.621 --> 01:09:39.381
It's like the story,
the whole universe is in here.

01:09:39.461 --> 01:09:41.100
I'm certain it is.

01:09:41.381 --> 01:09:43.301
-I could marry you.
-What?

01:09:44.102 --> 01:09:45.541
But we're cousins!

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:47.501
I don't care.

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:49.821
I want us always to be together.

01:09:49.901 --> 01:09:51.461
We are together.

01:10:00.661 --> 01:10:01.861
Come back.

01:10:09.661 --> 01:10:10.901
See you tomorrow.

01:10:10.982 --> 01:10:12.581
I'll be back tomorrow.

01:10:24.301 --> 01:10:25.861
What's he doing?

01:10:27.461 --> 01:10:28.901
What does he want?

01:10:30.742 --> 01:10:32.461
He lost his mother.

01:10:32.662 --> 01:10:34.061
He's hungry.

01:10:35.181 --> 01:10:37.061
He's only a few days old.

01:10:37.182 --> 01:10:39.181
He just learned how to walk.

01:10:41.381 --> 01:10:43.501
You can hold him, if you like.

01:10:46.102 --> 01:10:47.742
Be careful, Master Colin.

01:10:48.982 --> 01:10:50.301
Where did he come from?

01:10:50.381 --> 01:10:51.821
Three days ago...

01:10:52.741 --> 01:10:54.541
...I was out on the moor.

01:10:55.061 --> 01:10:57.381
I heard bleating under the bushes.

01:10:57.541 --> 01:10:59.942
So, I started to look, and I looked...

01:11:00.141 --> 01:11:03.501
...and I looked, and at last,
I seen a bit of gray by a rock.

01:11:04.581 --> 01:11:07.181
So, I climbed up
and there was the little one.

01:11:11.301 --> 01:11:12.422
Off you go.

01:11:13.701 --> 01:11:14.981
Go on. Go on.

01:11:21.901 --> 01:11:23.501
Give me your hand.

01:11:33.661 --> 01:11:34.861
You can do it.

01:11:39.181 --> 01:11:40.421
You can do it.

01:11:41.821 --> 01:11:43.181
You can do it.

01:11:44.141 --> 01:11:45.541
You can do it.

01:12:03.701 --> 01:12:05.741
You did it! You can walk!

01:12:05.861 --> 01:12:07.621
I did it! I did it!

01:12:08.021 --> 01:12:09.261
I did it!

01:12:15.501 --> 01:12:16.742
I did it!

01:12:32.941 --> 01:12:34.501
Are you a ghost?

01:12:34.661 --> 01:12:35.781
It's me!

01:12:38.781 --> 01:12:40.381
Medlock might hear you.

01:12:40.541 --> 01:12:42.861
Then we wouldn't have to worry
about her anymore.

01:12:42.942 --> 01:12:45.661
She'd drop dead
at the sight of you walking.

01:12:49.341 --> 01:12:50.821
How did you get here?

01:12:51.021 --> 01:12:52.741
I found the way by myself.

01:12:54.182 --> 01:12:55.821
You climbed the stairs?

01:12:57.062 --> 01:12:59.542
This is how I want it to be with my father.

01:13:00.181 --> 01:13:01.701
I want to surprise him.

01:13:01.781 --> 01:13:03.181
Just like this.

01:13:03.341 --> 01:13:05.861
I want him to see me
before anyone else does.

01:13:06.141 --> 01:13:07.981
I wish we knew how to find him.

01:13:08.061 --> 01:13:09.461
Medlock must know.

01:13:09.621 --> 01:13:11.701
We can steal the address from her.

01:13:12.821 --> 01:13:15.341
I'll have a fit,
and when she comes running--

01:13:15.621 --> 01:13:17.741
I saw a desk in your father's room.

01:13:18.621 --> 01:13:21.342
It had lots of papers on it.
Maybe it's there.

01:13:45.821 --> 01:13:48.261
I looked and I couldn't find the address.

01:13:48.341 --> 01:13:50.981
But I discovered another
of my uncle's secrets.

01:14:06.182 --> 01:14:07.501
That's my mother.

01:14:16.621 --> 01:14:18.662
I think that is my father.

01:14:23.501 --> 01:14:24.741
That's me.

01:14:41.101 --> 01:14:42.861
I think she's beautiful.

01:15:44.181 --> 01:15:45.501
Attention!

01:15:48.421 --> 01:15:49.701
Over here.

01:15:50.741 --> 01:15:51.861
Smile.

01:15:56.461 --> 01:15:58.102
Sit on the swing, Dickon.

01:15:59.901 --> 01:16:01.261
Look at each other.

01:16:01.341 --> 01:16:02.701
Now, look at me.

01:16:28.101 --> 01:16:29.421
Come on, Dickon!

01:16:38.741 --> 01:16:40.141
Stop all this.

01:16:40.261 --> 01:16:41.421
I am well.

01:16:42.301 --> 01:16:44.821
Write to my father
and tell him to come back.

01:16:44.901 --> 01:16:47.141
I do not believe you are well.

01:16:50.622 --> 01:16:52.501
Your pulse is much too quick.

01:16:53.141 --> 01:16:55.982
And there's a definite sign
of fever in your eyes.

01:16:56.102 --> 01:16:57.781
John, bring that ice.

01:16:58.821 --> 01:17:02.301
Despite what you and your cousin
may think, you're still under my care.

01:17:02.381 --> 01:17:06.662
Your father trusts me to do what is best
for you, and that's what I will do.

01:17:09.101 --> 01:17:12.101
God, look at your legs.
They're all swollen and red.

01:17:12.422 --> 01:17:13.701
Come on, Will.

01:17:29.941 --> 01:17:32.541
If I'm so sick,
you should send for my father.

01:17:32.781 --> 01:17:36.221
You are to stay in bed.
You are not to go out into the gardens.

01:17:37.101 --> 01:17:39.582
Give me the address and I'll write to him.

01:17:39.901 --> 01:17:41.502
You'll do no such thing.

01:17:41.981 --> 01:17:43.142
Give it to me.

01:17:43.221 --> 01:17:44.701
I've had enough.

01:17:45.021 --> 01:17:47.821
Between the wretched girl
and the dangers of the fresh air...

01:17:47.901 --> 01:17:50.261
...heaven knows what's happened to you.

01:17:50.461 --> 01:17:52.101
You could be clotting.

01:17:53.101 --> 01:17:55.261
She probably turned your chair over.

01:17:56.381 --> 01:17:58.461
I won't stand for it. Not anymore.

01:17:58.661 --> 01:18:01.221
I won't stand for any of it! Come on, John.

01:18:12.581 --> 01:18:14.621
I'm keeping you children apart.

01:18:14.701 --> 01:18:16.701
He is a very ill little boy.

01:18:16.941 --> 01:18:19.701
I've worked too hard and too long
to keep him alive...

01:18:19.781 --> 01:18:24.141
...to have him killed by one pig-headed,
meddlesome little girl like you.

01:18:45.781 --> 01:18:46.782
Come on.

01:18:54.381 --> 01:18:55.501
It's safe.

01:18:55.821 --> 01:18:57.141
Everybody's gone.

01:18:58.582 --> 01:19:00.261
Ben's waiting at the gate.

01:19:21.541 --> 01:19:22.781
Thank you.

01:19:23.461 --> 01:19:25.381
We're making magic here.

01:19:25.701 --> 01:19:28.221
When I grow up,
I'll make great discoveries.

01:19:28.381 --> 01:19:30.662
And this is my first experiment.

01:19:30.942 --> 01:19:31.941
Aye.

01:20:03.941 --> 01:20:05.541
'"Oh, great magic

01:20:06.141 --> 01:20:07.821
'"Please come to me

01:20:08.221 --> 01:20:10.141
'"Send me my father here

01:20:10.341 --> 01:20:12.101
'"Set his spirit free

01:20:12.261 --> 01:20:13.862
'"Oh, great magic

01:20:14.461 --> 01:20:16.141
'"Please come to me

01:20:16.581 --> 01:20:18.221
'"Send me my father here

'"Set his spirit free

01:20:20.741 --> 01:20:22.341
'"Oh, great magic

'"Please come to me

01:20:24.741 --> 01:20:26.501
'"Send me my father here

'"Set his spirit free

'"Oh, great magic

'"Send me my father here

01:20:34.661 --> 01:20:36.381
'"Set his spirit free'"

01:20:36.541 --> 01:20:37.581
Go!

01:21:29.541 --> 01:21:31.021
Where are you?

01:21:32.101 --> 01:21:34.541
In the garden! I'm in the garden!

01:21:36.061 --> 01:21:37.741
I'm in the garden!

01:21:41.021 --> 01:21:42.781
I'm in the garden...

01:21:44.382 --> 01:21:45.861
...with Colin!

01:22:06.821 --> 01:22:07.941
I must go.

01:22:09.541 --> 01:22:11.501
I must go! Immediately!

01:22:11.901 --> 01:22:14.021
I must go tonight. Prepare my bill.

01:23:09.381 --> 01:23:11.541
His Lordship's just arrived!

01:23:12.381 --> 01:23:13.541
His Lordship?

01:23:13.621 --> 01:23:15.302
Where? Where is he?

01:23:15.421 --> 01:23:16.581
Outside.

01:23:16.901 --> 01:23:18.541
Get me out of this thing.

01:23:18.941 --> 01:23:20.701
Will you get me out?

01:23:21.501 --> 01:23:23.141
Get me out of it!

01:23:23.301 --> 01:23:24.701
Oh, come on!

01:23:28.461 --> 01:23:30.981
You're home, sir.
We weren't expecting you.

01:23:31.501 --> 01:23:33.221
Here I am. Where's my son?

01:23:33.542 --> 01:23:36.261
He's in his room, of course, Your Lordship.

01:23:37.382 --> 01:23:40.221
Would you get back to the kitchen,
impudent girl!

01:23:55.261 --> 01:23:56.781
Where's my son?

01:23:59.141 --> 01:24:00.861
He's here, my lord.

01:24:01.701 --> 01:24:03.141
He must be here.

01:24:11.741 --> 01:24:13.021
What's happened?

01:24:15.941 --> 01:24:17.661
It's that child, my lord.

01:24:18.141 --> 01:24:20.261
She's created absolute havoc here.

01:24:21.021 --> 01:24:22.941
I've tried to control her.

01:24:23.462 --> 01:24:25.382
She must be sent away, my lord.

01:24:25.662 --> 01:24:27.461
She'll kill Master Colin...

01:24:27.901 --> 01:24:29.021
...for sure.

01:24:29.502 --> 01:24:30.941
Take me to her room.

01:24:31.621 --> 01:24:35.942
She has no regard for his fragile state
of health. She does what she pleases.

01:24:44.261 --> 01:24:45.701
You lock her in?

01:24:45.861 --> 01:24:47.421
I've had to, my lord.

01:24:47.581 --> 01:24:49.221
That's how wild she is.

01:24:52.262 --> 01:24:53.381
Mary?

01:24:55.741 --> 01:24:57.221
Your uncle's here.

01:25:09.221 --> 01:25:10.981
I beg your pardon, my lord.

01:25:15.021 --> 01:25:17.021
Perhaps they're in the garden.

01:25:18.301 --> 01:25:19.422
The garden?

01:25:20.581 --> 01:25:22.181
How can they be?

01:25:23.141 --> 01:25:24.902
It's quite impossible.

01:25:35.261 --> 01:25:37.061
I've done my best, sir.

01:25:37.942 --> 01:25:39.261
I really have.

01:25:39.741 --> 01:25:41.981
But with that child defying me--

01:25:42.301 --> 01:25:43.781
Silence, Medlock!

01:25:44.741 --> 01:25:46.461
She's just a child.

01:25:47.141 --> 01:25:48.941
I left you in charge.

01:25:51.102 --> 01:25:52.581
I'll resign, sir.

01:25:55.622 --> 01:25:57.181
I'll leave today.

01:26:06.941 --> 01:26:08.061
Don't!

01:26:30.821 --> 01:26:34.821
Around and around and around we go,
and where we stop, nobody knows.

01:26:39.141 --> 01:26:40.381
Catch me!

01:26:40.581 --> 01:26:41.982
Come get me!

01:26:43.421 --> 01:26:44.582
Where are you?

01:28:52.901 --> 01:28:54.341
I can't believe it.

01:28:58.181 --> 01:28:59.301
You're here.

01:28:59.901 --> 01:29:01.221
The magic worked.

01:29:25.141 --> 01:29:26.341
The garden.

01:29:26.621 --> 01:29:27.941
Let me show you.

01:29:29.541 --> 01:29:32.741
Mary found the key,
she opened the door and went inside....

01:29:36.661 --> 01:29:38.021
No one wants me!

01:29:47.101 --> 01:29:49.341
This is where the robin has his nest.

01:29:49.701 --> 01:29:51.141
See the babies?

01:29:52.701 --> 01:29:54.301
They'll be flying soon.

01:29:54.781 --> 01:29:56.301
This is where I walked first.

01:29:56.381 --> 01:29:58.341
I was like a baby myself.

01:31:08.901 --> 01:31:10.782
Why are you here by yourself?

01:31:13.382 --> 01:31:14.941
It wasn't wanted.

01:31:18.781 --> 01:31:20.421
What wasn't wanted?

01:31:23.141 --> 01:31:24.502
The garden.

01:31:27.782 --> 01:31:28.941
You're right.

01:31:32.981 --> 01:31:34.901
I never wanted to see it again.

01:31:35.261 --> 01:31:37.221
You never wanted to see Colin.

01:31:42.501 --> 01:31:44.581
You brought us back to life, Mary.

01:31:47.021 --> 01:31:49.541
You did something
I thought no one could do.

01:31:54.461 --> 01:31:55.941
Don't be afraid.

01:31:58.301 --> 01:32:00.101
I won't shut it up again.

01:32:00.741 --> 01:32:01.861
Believe me.

01:32:15.141 --> 01:32:16.261
Thank you.

01:32:24.901 --> 01:32:26.461
Should we call Colin?

01:33:01.701 --> 01:33:02.822
What's happening?

01:33:02.901 --> 01:33:04.421
Did you see them?

01:33:05.941 --> 01:33:07.222
Oh, look!

01:33:22.781 --> 01:33:24.222
Master Colin.

01:33:25.182 --> 01:33:26.501
Master Colin.

01:33:27.901 --> 01:33:29.101
He's walking.

01:33:56.101 --> 01:33:57.701
The spell was broken.

01:33:57.861 --> 01:34:00.581
My uncle learned to laugh,
and I learned to cry.

01:34:01.221 --> 01:34:03.461
The secret garden is always open now.

01:34:03.981 --> 01:34:05.101
Open...

01:34:05.181 --> 01:34:07.101
...and awake and alive.

01:34:08.501 --> 01:34:10.341
Ifyou look the right way...

01:34:10.421 --> 01:34:13.141
...you can see
that the whole world is a garden.
