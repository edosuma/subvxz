01:50.711 --> 01:52.280
ARTHUR: How do you do, sir?
MAN: Good morning, sir.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.381
Lovely sermon this morning.
WOMAN: Good morning.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.183
MAN: How are you today?

01:57.785 --> 02:00.488
Come on, Father.
Yes. Yes.

02:00.554 --> 02:03.056
He's a good man.
GRACE: Sorry, Arthur?

02:03.123 --> 02:04.725
Good man, good sermon.

02:08.696 --> 02:11.465
ARTHUR: Pharaoh's dream,
dream of the King of Egypt.

02:11.532 --> 02:13.467
Seven fat years,
seven lean years.

02:13.534 --> 02:14.868
Good sermon.

02:14.935 --> 02:17.137
DICKIE: Exceptional sermon.
I couldn't hear him.

02:17.205 --> 02:18.606
DICKIE:
Can one be good
if one's inaudible?

02:18.672 --> 02:21.041
A problem in ethics
for you, Father.

02:21.108 --> 02:22.343
DICKIE: Not everything
is a problem in ethics.

02:22.410 --> 02:24.245
And the seven fat cows

02:24.312 --> 02:27.648
were devoured by the
seven lean and hungry cows.

02:27.715 --> 02:30.050
Yes, and don't I feel like
those lean and hungry cows.

02:30.117 --> 02:31.485
My point, precisely.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.120
Lunch in
about an hour, sir.

02:33.187 --> 02:34.288
Thank you.
Yes, sir.

02:34.355 --> 02:35.656
My, it's going to rain.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.891
I could've told you that.
I feel it in my leg.

02:39.293 --> 02:40.828
Would you please
mind the gramophone?

02:40.894 --> 02:42.696
The center of
a well-regulated home.

02:42.763 --> 02:43.897
CATHERINE: Mother,
I'll be right down.

02:43.964 --> 02:45.266
It helps me concentrate.
GRACE: Dearest.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.568
Concentrate on what, pray?

02:47.635 --> 02:51.004
Oh, Catherine.
It's all right,
Father, I just...

02:51.071 --> 02:52.573
I just wanted
to see about the...

02:52.640 --> 02:54.041
To study, Father.
To study.

02:54.107 --> 02:55.142
What'd you say?

02:55.209 --> 02:56.644
I said the gramophone,

02:56.710 --> 03:00.180
the music
of the gramophone
helps me to study, Father.

03:00.248 --> 03:02.416
Study is not
what you appeared
to be involved in

03:02.483 --> 03:04.785
when I came downstairs
last night.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.186
Your friend and you...

03:06.254 --> 03:09.390
Edwina, Father.
Edwina had just
stopped by to...

03:09.457 --> 03:10.558
She just stopped by
on the way

03:10.624 --> 03:12.526
from Graham's dance
to fetch a book and...

03:12.593 --> 03:16.264
And you are involved
with her in what,
a sort of what?

03:16.330 --> 03:18.999
Reading club?
Um...

03:26.474 --> 03:28.342
No, no, Father,
I must say that I believe

03:28.409 --> 03:31.412
I have a right to
a certain measure
of autonomy.

03:31.479 --> 03:32.880
I'm sorry,
what were we discussing?

03:32.946 --> 03:35.082
Edwina.
Ah, Edwina.

03:35.148 --> 03:36.984
What a fast
and flighty little...

03:38.919 --> 03:41.054
I'm sorry, Dickie.
You're rather keen
on her, aren't you?

03:41.121 --> 03:43.491
Well, you would have
had ample proof of
that fact, Grace,

03:43.557 --> 03:46.026
if you'd seen them in
the attitude I caught
them in last night.

03:46.093 --> 03:47.495
We were practicing
the Bunny Hug.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.062
GRACE: The what, dear?
The Bunny Hug.

03:49.129 --> 03:50.664
Oh, is that what you're
calling it these days?

03:50.731 --> 03:52.032
It's the new dance.

03:52.099 --> 03:54.768
It's like
the Turkey Trot,
only more dignified.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.470
Good sermon, miss?
Mmm-hmm.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.572
Joseph interprets
Pharaoh's dreams.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.274
No more like
the Fox Trot, really.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.376
Fox Trot or
the Kangaroo Glide.

04:02.443 --> 04:04.278
Well, whichever animal
is responsible

04:04.345 --> 04:06.780
for the posture that
I found you and your
friend in last night.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.181
(CLEARS THROAT)

04:08.248 --> 04:09.550
Yes. Yes, yes.

04:09.617 --> 04:11.652
Or to make an end,

04:11.719 --> 04:14.488
I doubt...

04:14.555 --> 04:18.492
I doubt the gramophone
aids you in what you
call your studies.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.528
Ah-ha. Ah-ha.

04:22.430 --> 04:24.732
I see.
It all comes
clear to me now.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.767
Yes, it's raining.
(SOFTLY) May I see it?

04:26.834 --> 04:29.069
DICKIE: We're talking about
a different subject,
aren't we, sir?

04:29.136 --> 04:31.138
It's not about
the gramophone.

04:31.204 --> 04:32.940
It's about Ronnie.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.875
You know, sir,
I wouldn't have
thought it of you.

04:34.942 --> 04:38.078
I certainly would not.
And at this festive season...

04:38.145 --> 04:39.913
At this
festive season, Father,

04:39.980 --> 04:42.215
to throw it up to me,
to bring that up again...

04:42.282 --> 04:44.618
Nobody's bringing that up.
Yes, they are.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.119
Ronnie, Ronnie...

04:46.186 --> 04:49.890
Ronnie got into Osbourne,
as I did not. Why?

04:49.957 --> 04:52.259
As he applies himself.

04:52.326 --> 04:54.161
And Ronnie...
Ah, Dickie.

04:54.227 --> 04:55.963
Do you have a coin
to give the fellow?

04:56.029 --> 04:57.498
No, sir, I have not.

04:57.565 --> 04:59.467
And if I may,
I'm going to my room.

04:59.533 --> 05:02.370
Perhaps I might suggest you
take that gramophone with you.

05:02.436 --> 05:03.804
May I ask why?

05:03.871 --> 05:06.540
Because it's out of place
in a civilized home.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.442
GRACE: I'll take up
the other matter after lunch.

05:08.509 --> 05:09.910
CATHERINE:
Oh, yes. I know.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.179
Well, I don't think
I've ever
seen a nicer setting.

05:12.245 --> 05:13.714
Is it his mother's?
Yes, it was.

05:13.781 --> 05:15.383
Isn't it lovely?

05:16.216 --> 05:17.985
Pelting down out there.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.319
What, dear?

05:19.387 --> 05:21.188
I said it's raining.
What are you reading?

05:21.254 --> 05:23.156
Len Rogers' memoirs.

05:23.223 --> 05:24.558
Who was Len Rogers?

05:24.625 --> 05:26.159
He was a trades union leader.

05:26.226 --> 05:27.260
Was he a radical?

05:27.327 --> 05:29.797
Oh, yes, I'd say so.

05:29.863 --> 05:32.165
Does John know of
your political beliefs?
Oh, yes.

05:32.232 --> 05:33.601
And he still
wants to marry you?

05:33.667 --> 05:35.035
Seems to.

05:36.804 --> 05:39.206
Oh, I've asked John
to come early for lunch.

05:40.708 --> 05:41.742
Hmm. What?

05:41.809 --> 05:43.377
CATHERINE: He's coming
early for lunch.

05:43.444 --> 05:44.845
Oh, good.

05:44.912 --> 05:47.548
You won't let me down
and forbid the match
or anything, will you?

05:47.615 --> 05:49.817
Because I warn you,
if you do, I shall elope.

05:49.883 --> 05:52.319
Never fear, my dear,
I'm far too delighted

05:52.386 --> 05:55.689
at the prospect of getting
you off our hands at last.

05:55.756 --> 05:57.558
Does Desmond know, by the way?

05:57.625 --> 06:00.027
I'm not sure
I like that "at last."

06:00.093 --> 06:01.595
Have you told Desmond yet?

06:01.662 --> 06:03.464
Kate, do you love him?

06:04.732 --> 06:06.600
John? Yes, I do.

06:06.667 --> 06:09.503
Do you?
You don't behave
as if you're in love.

06:09.570 --> 06:12.072
How does one behave
as if one is in love?

06:12.139 --> 06:15.676
One doesn't read
The Social Evil
and the Social Good.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.545
One reads Lord Byron.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.847
Ah, is that so? I see.

06:19.913 --> 06:23.350
You know, I don't think
you modern girls have the
feelings our generation did.

06:23.417 --> 06:24.885
Very well, Mother.
I love John

06:24.952 --> 06:27.120
in every way that
a woman can love a man.

06:27.187 --> 06:28.956
Does that satisfy you?

06:29.022 --> 06:30.691
My, look at the rain.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.363
Hello. I thought I saw
someone in the garden.

06:36.430 --> 06:37.598
Where?

06:37.665 --> 06:39.132
Over there. Do you see?

06:39.199 --> 06:41.234
Well, whoever it is,
is getting terribly wet.

06:41.301 --> 06:42.470
JOHN: Good morning, Violet.
VIOLET: Good afternoon, sir.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.104
Was that John?
Sounded like it.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.873
Yes, it's John. Quick,
into the drawing room.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.776
All right. Good. Here we go.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.277
You've forgotten your bag.

06:50.343 --> 06:52.045
What on earth is going on?

06:52.112 --> 06:53.380
We're leaving you alone
with John.

06:53.447 --> 06:55.248
When you finish,
cough or something.

06:55.315 --> 06:57.651
What do you mean,
"Or something"?
Oh, I know.

06:57.718 --> 07:00.888
Knock on the floor three times
with your stick and then
we'll come in.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.526
You don't think that might
look a trifle coincidental?

07:05.593 --> 07:06.994
(SHUSHING)

07:12.600 --> 07:14.367
Mr. Watherstone.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.437
John. How are you?

07:17.505 --> 07:18.972
Hello, sir.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.041
Have you got a coin?

07:23.010 --> 07:25.012
Here.

07:25.078 --> 07:28.015
Thank Mr. Simms
for delivering on
a Sunday, will you?

07:28.081 --> 07:29.483
Thank you much, sir.
Yes.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.552
Glad to see you.
Glad you could come.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.554
I see you have your tree.
Yes, yes.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.523
Fellow just
put it up for us.

07:36.624 --> 07:38.992
How are you, sir?
Oh, fine.

07:39.059 --> 07:41.261
This arthritis is
troubling me a bit, but...

07:41.328 --> 07:43.296
I'm sorry to hear that, sir.
Catherine told me
it was better.

07:43.363 --> 07:45.633
Yes. It was better.

07:45.699 --> 07:46.900
Now it's worse.

08:05.485 --> 08:10.390
Well, now, I understand
you wish to marry
my daughter.

08:10.457 --> 08:11.892
JOHN: Yes, sir.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.426
That is to say,
I proposed to her

08:13.493 --> 08:15.195
and she's done me
the honor of accepting me.

08:15.262 --> 08:18.832
I see. I trust when you
corrected yourself that
your second statement

08:18.899 --> 08:21.569
wasn't a denial of your first.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.170
I mean, you do
really wish to
marry her?

08:23.236 --> 08:24.504
Yes, of course, sir.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.740
Why, "Of course"?

08:26.807 --> 08:29.209
There are plenty of people
about who don't wish to
marry her.

08:29.276 --> 08:31.244
I mean,
of course because
I proposed to her.

08:31.311 --> 08:32.913
Well, that too
doesn't necessarily follow.

08:32.980 --> 08:35.683
However, we don't need
to quibble.

08:35.749 --> 08:38.118
We'll take the sentimental
side of the project
for granted.

09:07.881 --> 09:11.084
As regard to the
more practical side,
I hope you won't mind

09:11.151 --> 09:12.986
if I ask you one or two
rather personal questions.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.521
Naturally not, sir.
It's your duty.

09:14.588 --> 09:16.123
Quite so.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.525
Now, your income.
Are you able to
live on it?

09:18.592 --> 09:19.693
No, sir.
I'm in the
regular army.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.328
Yes, of course.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.731
But my army pay
is supplemented by
an allowance from my father.

09:23.797 --> 09:25.398
Yes, so I understand.

09:25.465 --> 09:27.267
Now your pay will be,
I take it, about £24
a month?

09:27.334 --> 09:29.202
Yes, sir,
that's exactly right.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.238
So that your total income
with your subaltern's pay
and allowances,

09:31.304 --> 09:33.140
plus the allowance from
your father would be,
I take it,

09:33.206 --> 09:35.242
about £420 a year.

09:35.308 --> 09:36.576
Again, exactly the figure.

09:36.644 --> 09:39.146
Well, that all seems
perfectly satisfactory.

09:39.212 --> 09:42.049
I don't think I need delay
my congratulations any longer.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.984
Thank you, sir.

09:44.051 --> 09:46.386
Do you smoke?
I do.

09:46.453 --> 09:50.724
Now, I propose
to settle on my daughter
one-sixth of my total capital.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.259
Which worked out
to the final fraction,

09:52.325 --> 09:56.063
is exactly £833,
six shillings and eight pence.

09:56.129 --> 10:01.001
But let's deal in round
figures, shall we, and
call it £850.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.903
Well, I call that
very generous, sir.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.838
Well, it's not as generous
as I would have liked,

10:04.905 --> 10:06.840
but if that arrangement
seems agreeable,

10:06.907 --> 10:09.576
I don't think that
we have anything more
that we need to discuss.

10:09.643 --> 10:11.278
No, sir.
Splendid.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.214
(TAPPING)

10:19.920 --> 10:22.756
Pretty rotten weather,
isn't it, sir?

10:22.823 --> 10:24.157
Yes, vile.

10:26.093 --> 10:28.328
(TAPPING)

10:37.170 --> 10:38.205
Would you
like a cigarette?

10:38.271 --> 10:41.008
Ah, no, thank you, sir.
I'm still smoking.

10:44.044 --> 10:45.212
(LAUGHING)

10:46.613 --> 10:48.648
Well?
Well, what?

10:48.716 --> 10:50.617
How did your
little chat go?

10:50.684 --> 10:52.753
I understood
you weren't supposed to know
we were having a little chat.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.321
Oh.

10:54.387 --> 10:57.557
You are infuriating.
Is everything all right, John?

10:57.624 --> 10:58.992
Oh, I'm so glad.
I really am.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.160
Thank you, Mrs. Winslow.

11:00.227 --> 11:02.062
Can I kiss you?
JOHN: Of course.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.364
Well, I'm practically
your mother now.

11:04.431 --> 11:07.735
Well, I, by the same token,
am practically your father,
but if you'll forgive me.

11:09.236 --> 11:12.039
Oh, he's gone and left
the garden gate open.

11:15.976 --> 11:19.412
Could someone come and
close the garden gate for us?

11:19.479 --> 11:21.414
I don't suppose
you two would mind
if we left you alone

11:21.481 --> 11:22.916
for a few minutes,
would you?

11:22.983 --> 11:24.151
ARTHUR: Grace, I think
we might allow ourselves

11:24.217 --> 11:26.153
a little modest
celebration at lunch, hmm?

11:26.219 --> 11:28.655
Would you go and
get me the key of the cellar?
GRACE: Indeed I will.

11:28.722 --> 11:31.658
Violet, would
you have someone see
to the gate, please?

11:31.725 --> 11:33.093
VIOLET: Yes, sir.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.315
Was it an ordeal?

11:55.382 --> 11:57.751
Scared to death.
My poor darling.

12:04.591 --> 12:06.359
The annoying thing was

12:06.426 --> 12:08.328
that I had a whole lot of
neatly turned phrases
ready for him,

12:08.395 --> 12:09.596
but he wouldn't
let me use them.

12:09.662 --> 12:10.864
I'm sure they
were rather good.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.332
I thought they were.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.901
You want to do
your speech for me?

12:13.967 --> 12:15.235
Love to.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.637
What is it?

12:26.646 --> 12:28.548
Ronnie, what is it?

12:28.615 --> 12:31.118
Where did Father go?
Is he gone?

12:31.184 --> 12:32.685
I'll go and get him.

12:34.121 --> 12:35.422
CATHERINE: Father.

12:35.488 --> 12:38.826
RONNIE: No,
don't go and get him.
No! Kate, please don't.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.894
No, don't.
Please, Kate, don't.

12:40.961 --> 12:43.096
What's the trouble, Ronnie?

12:43.163 --> 12:45.465
You'd better go and change,
hadn't you?

12:45.532 --> 12:46.867
No.
What's the trouble, darling?

12:46.934 --> 12:48.535
You can tell me.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.804
You know
John Watherstone, darling.
You met him last holidays.

12:50.871 --> 12:53.173
Don't you remember?
JOHN: I'll disappear.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.780
Now, darling, what is it?

13:00.848 --> 13:02.916
You can tell me.
Have you run away?

13:03.616 --> 13:05.018
What is it then?

13:16.596 --> 13:17.865
Oh, God.

13:17.931 --> 13:20.100
I didn't do it.
Kate, really, I didn't.

13:20.167 --> 13:24.071
No, darling. This letter
is addressed to Father.
Did you open it?

13:24.137 --> 13:25.939
Yes.
You shouldn't have done that.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.608
I was going to tear it up.

13:28.675 --> 13:31.244
But we could
tell Father term had
ended two days sooner.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.346
No.
I'm back for the
Christmas holidays.

13:33.413 --> 13:36.483
No, darling.
Kate, I didn't do it.

13:36.549 --> 13:37.885
Really, I didn't.

13:40.187 --> 13:43.090
Ah, Ronnie, old lad,
how's everything?
Back early, eh?

13:43.156 --> 13:44.791
You take him upstairs.
I'll get Mother.

13:44.858 --> 13:45.959
All right.

13:46.994 --> 13:48.295
What's up then, old chap?

13:48.361 --> 13:49.629
Nothing.

13:55.368 --> 13:56.836
Have you been sacked?

13:57.437 --> 13:59.006
Bad luck. What for?

13:59.072 --> 14:00.173
I didn't do it.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.541
Of course you didn't.
I know that.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.643
Honestly, I didn't.
That's all right, old chap.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.879
I believe you.
No need to go on about it.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.380
I say, you're a bit damp,
aren't you?

14:07.447 --> 14:08.581
I've been out in the rain.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.517
You're shivering
a bit, too.

14:10.583 --> 14:11.851
Oughtn't you to change?

14:11.919 --> 14:13.820
I mean, we don't want you
catching pneumonia, do we?

14:13.887 --> 14:15.055
I'm all right.

14:15.122 --> 14:17.690
Mother.
There, darling.

14:18.725 --> 14:20.193
There.

14:20.827 --> 14:22.462
All right, now.

14:22.529 --> 14:23.530
I didn't do it, Mother.

14:23.596 --> 14:24.764
No, darling,
of course you didn't.

14:24.831 --> 14:26.066
I know you didn't.

14:26.133 --> 14:28.668
Let's get out of
these nasty wet things.

14:28.735 --> 14:29.802
Don't tell Father.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.972
No, darling.
Not yet. I promise.

14:32.039 --> 14:34.507
(GASPS) A new uniform, too.
What a shame.

14:35.608 --> 14:37.677
All right, Ronnie.
It's all right.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.648
Bad news?

14:43.616 --> 14:44.617
Expelled?

14:44.684 --> 14:45.885
That's right.

14:45.953 --> 14:47.087
What's he supposed
to have done?

14:47.988 --> 14:50.390
He's supposed to have...

14:50.457 --> 14:53.126
(INAUDIBLE)

14:53.193 --> 14:55.328
Just think what
that little creature
has been going through

14:55.395 --> 14:56.863
these last 10 days.

14:56.930 --> 14:59.866
It does seem pretty
heartless, I admit.

14:59.933 --> 15:02.035
You must remember, darling...

15:03.803 --> 15:06.073
You must remember,
he's not really at school.

15:06.139 --> 15:07.374
He is in the services.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.775
What difference can that make?

15:08.841 --> 15:10.910
Their ways of
doing things may seem
to an outsider brutal,

15:10.978 --> 15:12.612
but at least
they are always fair.

15:12.679 --> 15:16.416
Must have been
a full inquiry before
they take a step of this sort.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.685
What's more,
if there's been
a delay of 10 days,

15:18.751 --> 15:19.987
it would only have been
in order to give the boy

15:20.053 --> 15:22.922
a better chance
to clear himself.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.691
I'm awfully sorry.

15:24.757 --> 15:25.858
How will your father take it?

15:25.925 --> 15:27.627
DESMOND: Ah, Violet.
It might kill him.

15:27.694 --> 15:29.296
Oh, heavens, we've got
Desmond to lunch.
I'd forgotten.

15:29.362 --> 15:30.363
Desmond?

15:30.430 --> 15:32.099
Desmond Curry,
our family solicitor.

15:32.165 --> 15:35.168
Oh, Lord. Darling,
be polite to him,
won't you?

15:35.235 --> 15:36.503
Am I usually
rude to your guests?

15:36.569 --> 15:37.770
No, but he doesn't
know about us yet.

15:37.837 --> 15:38.972
Who does?

15:39.039 --> 15:40.873
Yes, but he's been
in love with me for years.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.375
It's a family joke.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.213
VIOLET: Mr. Curry.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.181
Hello, Desmond.
I don't think you
know John Watherstone.

15:48.248 --> 15:50.683
No! But of course
I've heard a lot
about him.

15:50.750 --> 15:53.386
How do you do?
Well, well, well.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.787
I trust I'm not early.

15:54.854 --> 15:56.556
CATHERINE: No, no.
Punctual, as always.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.426
Capital. Good.

15:59.492 --> 16:00.960
How is your shoulder?
I'm so sorry.

16:01.028 --> 16:02.495
No, I'm sorry.
Catherine. Please.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.998
No, no. I was
only going to ask
how your shoulder was.

16:05.065 --> 16:07.434
Ah, not very
well, I'm afraid.
The damp, you know.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.370
I'm sorry to hear that.
Old cricket injury.

16:10.437 --> 16:13.906
Well, it seems I'm to
congratulate you both.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.708
Violet told me
just now at the door.

16:15.775 --> 16:17.777
Yes, I must
congratulate you both.

16:17.844 --> 16:19.712
Thank you.
Thank you so much, Desmond.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.049
Of course,
it's quite expected,
I know. Quite expected.

16:22.115 --> 16:25.418
Still, it was rather
a surprise hearing it
from Violet that way.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.087
We were going to tell you,
Desmond, dear.

16:27.154 --> 16:28.821
It was only official
this morning, you know.

16:28.888 --> 16:30.490
In fact, you're the
first person to hear it.

16:30.557 --> 16:31.958
Am I? Am I indeed?

16:32.025 --> 16:33.493
Ah, I see
you've got your tree.

16:34.261 --> 16:35.628
Hello, Mrs. Winslow.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.330
Hello, Desmond, dear.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.033
I've got him to bed.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.000
Grace, when did we last
have the cellars seen to?

16:41.068 --> 16:42.235
Nobody ill, I hope?

16:42.302 --> 16:43.670
They're in
shocking condition.
Oh, hello, Desmond.

16:43.736 --> 16:45.272
How are you?
You're not looking well.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.706
The old cricket thing.
ARTHUR: Violet.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.975
Is anybody ill?
Any relation of D.W.H. Curry?

16:49.042 --> 16:50.043
He used to
play for Middlesex.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.678
I am D.W.H. Curry.

16:51.744 --> 16:53.613
Curry of Curry's Match?
That's right.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.948
Hat-trick against the
Players in,
what year was it now?

16:56.015 --> 16:57.284
1895 at Lord's.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.418
You were a hero of mine.

16:58.485 --> 17:00.287
Was I? Was I indeed?

17:00.353 --> 17:03.690
JOHN: I used to have
a signed photograph of you.

17:03.756 --> 17:06.259
Yes, I used to sign a lot
once for schoolboys.

17:08.461 --> 17:11.698
Well, I think
we might try a little of
the Madeira before luncheon.

17:11.763 --> 17:13.800
Ah.
We're celebrating...

17:14.901 --> 17:16.836
It's all right, Father.
Desmond knows.

17:16.903 --> 17:19.606
Yes, indeed,
it's wonderful
news, isn't it?

17:19.672 --> 17:23.076
I'll most gladly
drink a toast to the...

17:23.143 --> 17:26.445
"Happy pair," I think
is the phrase that's
eluding you.

17:26.512 --> 17:29.282
As a matter of fact, I was
looking for something
new to say.

17:29.349 --> 17:33.120
Oh, a forlorn quest,
my dear Desmond.

17:33.186 --> 17:34.421
A forlorn quest.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.956
Arthur, really,
you mustn't be
so rude.

17:37.023 --> 17:39.759
No, no, no, no. I meant,
naturally, that nobody,

17:39.826 --> 17:43.263
with the possible
exception of Voltaire

17:43.330 --> 17:46.366
could find anything new to
say about an engaged couple.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.235
Hello.
Ah, Dickie.

17:48.301 --> 17:49.702
A toast to the happy pair.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.704
DICKIE: Oh, is that all
finally spliced up now?

17:51.771 --> 17:54.741
Kate definitely
being entered for
the marriage stakes.

17:54.807 --> 17:56.143
Good egg.

17:56.209 --> 17:58.678
Quite so.
I should have added,

17:58.745 --> 18:01.881
"With the possible
exception of Voltaire
and Dickie Winslow."

18:01.948 --> 18:04.784
Are we allowed to drink
to our own healths?

18:04.851 --> 18:06.486
Oh, I think
it's permissible.
No, it's bad luck.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.155
We defy augury,
don't we, Kate?

18:08.221 --> 18:09.822
You mustn't say
that, John, dear.

18:09.889 --> 18:11.591
I know.
You can drink
each other's healths.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.460
That's all right.

18:13.526 --> 18:16.796
So our superstitious terrors
are allayed, are they?

18:18.064 --> 18:19.299
Good.

18:19.366 --> 18:21.801
To Catherine and John.

18:23.503 --> 18:25.938
Oh, Violet.
We mustn't leave you out.

18:26.005 --> 18:27.407
You must join us
in this toast.

18:27.474 --> 18:28.775
Nothing for me, sir.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.943
ARTHUR: Your reluctance
would be more convincing

18:31.010 --> 18:32.812
if I hadn't noticed
you brought an extra glass.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.681
Oh, I didn't bring
it for myself, sir.

18:34.747 --> 18:36.416
I brought it
for Master Ronnie.

18:36.483 --> 18:38.151
You brought
another glass
for Master Ronnie?

18:38.218 --> 18:40.787
Well, I thought you might
allow him just a taste, sir.

18:40.853 --> 18:42.955
Just to drink the toast.
He's that grown-up
these days.

18:43.022 --> 18:46.559
But Master Ronnie doesn't
get back from Osbourne
until Tuesday, Violet.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.228
No, sir. He's back already.
The girl said.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.730
No, but the
Christmas holidays don't
start until Tuesday, Violet.

18:50.797 --> 18:54.100
Well, the girl saw him
with her own two eyes.
Isn't that right, ma'am?

19:01.174 --> 19:04.143
Grace, what does this mean?

19:04.211 --> 19:06.045
All right, Violet,
you can go.

19:06.112 --> 19:07.347
Yes, miss.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.919
Catherine, did you know
Ronnie was back?

19:13.486 --> 19:14.987
Yes.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.525
Dickie?
Yes, Father.

19:19.559 --> 19:21.761
Grace?

19:21.828 --> 19:24.231
We thought you
shouldn't know for
the time being, Arthur.

19:24.297 --> 19:26.165
Just for the time being.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.570
Is the boy very ill?

19:33.640 --> 19:34.841
(EXHALES)

19:35.508 --> 19:37.310
Answer me, someone.

19:38.978 --> 19:41.481
Is the boy very ill?

19:41.548 --> 19:43.483
No, Father,
he's not ill.

19:46.052 --> 19:48.788
Will someone tell me
what has happened, please?

19:56.429 --> 19:58.130
He, um...

20:00.600 --> 20:03.336
He brought this letter
for you, Arthur.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.708
Will you read it
to me, please?

20:08.775 --> 20:09.976
Arthur, not
in front of the...

20:10.042 --> 20:11.778
Will you read it
to me, please?

20:21.988 --> 20:26.393
"Sir, I am commanded by
my Lords' Commissioners
of the Admiralty

20:26.459 --> 20:28.628
"to inform you that
they have received
a communication

20:28.695 --> 20:32.064
"from the Commanding Officer
of the Royal Naval College
at Osbourne,

20:32.131 --> 20:34.601
"reporting the theft of
a five-shilling postal order

20:34.667 --> 20:36.669
"at the college on
the seventh instant,

20:36.736 --> 20:39.606
"which was afterwards
cashed at the Post Office.

20:39.672 --> 20:42.475
"Investigation of
the circumstances
of the case

20:42.542 --> 20:44.844
"leaves no other
conclusion possible

20:44.911 --> 20:48.080
"than that
the postal order
was cashed by your son,

20:48.147 --> 20:50.883
"Cadet Ronald Arthur Winslow.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.620
"My Lords
deeply regret that they
must therefore request you

20:53.686 --> 20:56.756
"to withdraw your son
from the college.

20:56.823 --> 20:59.091
"I am, sir,
your obedient servant..."

21:00.026 --> 21:02.028
It's signed by...

21:03.430 --> 21:05.332
I can't read his name.

21:20.447 --> 21:24.917
Desmond, would you be
kind enough to have Ronnie
come down and see me, please?

21:24.984 --> 21:27.153
Arthur, he's in bed.
You told me he wasn't ill.

21:27.219 --> 21:29.221
He's not at all well.
Thank you, Desmond.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.357
Of course.

21:30.423 --> 21:32.224
Perhaps the rest of you
would go into luncheon.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.193
Grace, would you
take them in, please?

21:34.260 --> 21:36.062
Arthur, don't you think...

21:36.128 --> 21:38.197
Dickie, would you decant
the claret I brought up
from the cellar?

21:38.264 --> 21:40.232
You will find it on the
sideboard in the dining room.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.335
Yes, Father.
Thank you.

21:42.402 --> 21:44.103
Arthur.
Yes, Grace.

21:44.871 --> 21:46.773
Please don't...

21:46.839 --> 21:48.341
Please don't...

21:50.610 --> 21:52.845
What mustn't I do?

21:52.912 --> 21:55.482
Please don't forget
he's only a child.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.386
Come on, Mother.

22:01.053 --> 22:03.189
Come on, darling.
It's all right.

22:14.501 --> 22:16.135
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

22:16.903 --> 22:18.337
Come in.

22:21.774 --> 22:23.510
Come in and close the door.

22:28.481 --> 22:30.182
Come over here.

22:36.589 --> 22:38.425
Why aren't you in uniform?

22:38.491 --> 22:40.593
It got wet.

22:40.660 --> 22:42.862
How did it get wet?

22:42.929 --> 22:45.131
I was out in the garden,
in the rain.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.533
Why?

22:47.700 --> 22:49.235
I was hiding.

22:49.301 --> 22:50.670
From me?

22:52.939 --> 22:54.574
Do you remember once
you promised me that

22:54.641 --> 22:57.376
if you got into
trouble of any sort,
you'd come to me first?

22:57.444 --> 22:58.611
Yes, Father.

22:58.678 --> 22:59.946
Why didn't you
come to me now?

23:00.012 --> 23:01.981
Why did you have to go
and hide in the garden?

23:02.048 --> 23:03.215
I don't know, Father.

23:03.282 --> 23:05.217
Are you so frightened of me?

23:08.755 --> 23:10.557
It says in this letter
that you stole a postal order.

23:10.623 --> 23:11.624
But I...

23:11.691 --> 23:13.460
No.

23:13.526 --> 23:16.596
I don't want you to say a word
until you've heard what I have
to say first.

23:18.765 --> 23:21.167
If you did it,
you must tell me.

23:21.233 --> 23:25.204
I shan't be angry with you,
Ronnie, provided you tell
me the truth.

23:25.271 --> 23:27.607
But if you tell me a lie,
I shall know it.

23:27.674 --> 23:30.877
Because a lie between
you and me cannot be hidden.

23:30.943 --> 23:33.780
I shall know it, Ronnie.

23:33.846 --> 23:36.082
So remember that
before you speak.

23:36.148 --> 23:37.316
Hmm?

23:38.485 --> 23:41.353
Did you steal
this postal order?

23:41.420 --> 23:43.222
No, Father, I didn't.

23:44.957 --> 23:46.993
Did you steal
this postal order?

23:48.495 --> 23:50.396
No, Father, I didn't.

23:53.733 --> 23:55.434
Go on back to bed.

24:26.332 --> 24:28.501
DICKIE: "The efforts
of Mr. Arthur Winslow

24:28.568 --> 24:31.270
"to secure
a fair trial for his son,

24:31.337 --> 24:35.307
"having been
thwarted at every turn
by a soulless oligarchy..."

24:35.374 --> 24:37.510
Soulless oligarchy,
that's rather good.

24:37.577 --> 24:41.213
"It is high time

24:44.917 --> 24:46.485
WOMAN: Tell me
a piece of news.

24:46.553 --> 24:47.987
I'll tell you
a piece of news.

24:48.054 --> 24:50.657
Saw a chap
on the train today,
had on brown boots.

24:50.723 --> 24:52.525
Brown boots, I ask you.

24:52.592 --> 24:54.527
Did he have on a brown suit?
That doesn't excuse it.

24:54.594 --> 24:55.895
Oh, can you
get this out
this afternoon?

24:55.962 --> 24:57.530
I have to go
to the law library.

24:57.597 --> 25:00.633
Polly, do you think you can
get this out this afternoon?

25:00.700 --> 25:02.134
Fighting on many fronts,
is that it, Cath?

25:02.201 --> 25:03.369
Yes, that's right, darling.

25:03.435 --> 25:05.037
Cannon to the right
of you, and so on?
Mmm.

25:05.104 --> 25:06.238
They paying you here yet?

25:06.305 --> 25:08.741
No, I just do it for
the sport of the thing.

25:08.808 --> 25:11.077
The other's from Perplexed.

25:11.143 --> 25:13.946
"What with the present

25:14.013 --> 25:16.983

"this correspondence now

25:25.558 --> 25:28.194
Well, in any case,
it'll blow over
before the wedding.

25:29.428 --> 25:30.429
Postponed again?

25:30.496 --> 25:32.364
His father's
out of the country.

25:32.431 --> 25:35.568
Nothing wrong? I mean,
I'm not gonna have to quirt
him with my riding crop, am I?

25:35.635 --> 25:38.504
This correspondence now
must cease.

25:38.571 --> 25:40.973
Well, I'm late for
a meeting with the guv.

25:56.956 --> 25:59.325
Dickie,

25:59.391 --> 26:01.761
what do you suppose
one of your bookmaker friends

26:01.828 --> 26:05.564
would lay in the way
of odds against your
getting a degree?

26:05.632 --> 26:08.567
Oh, well, let's think.
Say about evens?

26:08.635 --> 26:10.737
Hmm.

26:10.803 --> 26:14.073
I doubt whether at that price
your friend would find
many takers.

26:14.140 --> 26:15.808
Well, perhaps
seven-to-four against.

26:15.875 --> 26:18.645
I see. And the odds
against you eventually
becoming a civil servant?

26:18.711 --> 26:20.579
Well, a bit steeper,
I suppose.

26:20.647 --> 26:22.414
Exactly. Quite a bit steeper.

26:22.481 --> 26:24.550
You don't want to
have a bet, do you?

26:24.617 --> 26:26.485
No, Dickie,
I'm not a gambler.

26:27.754 --> 26:29.656
And that is exactly
the trouble.

26:31.691 --> 26:35.494
Unhappily, I'm no longer
in a position to gamble
£200 a year

26:35.561 --> 26:38.030
on what you yourself
admit is an outside chance.

26:38.097 --> 26:40.166
It's the case, I suppose.
Mmm-hmm.

26:40.232 --> 26:42.334
You want me to leave Oxford,
is that it?

26:42.401 --> 26:43.636
I'm afraid so.

26:43.703 --> 26:45.672
Oh, straightaway?

26:45.738 --> 26:48.040
No, no. You can
finish your year.
And then what?

26:48.107 --> 26:50.109
I could get you a job
here at the bank.

26:50.176 --> 26:52.078
Oh, Lord.

26:52.144 --> 26:54.380
Oh, it'd be quite a good job.

26:54.446 --> 26:57.283
Happily, my influence
here still counts
for something.

26:59.485 --> 27:02.388
Father, if I promised you,
I mean, really promised you.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.891
I'm afraid my mind
is finally made up.

27:04.957 --> 27:06.458
Oh, Lord.

27:06.525 --> 27:08.094
This is
rather a shock
for you, isn't it?

27:08.160 --> 27:10.429
What? No, no.
It isn't, really.

27:10.496 --> 27:12.865
I've been
rather expecting it,
as a matter of fact.

27:12.932 --> 27:14.767
Things... Things are tight.

27:14.834 --> 27:16.468
Yes, things are tight.

27:16.535 --> 27:20.172
And you're still hoping...
Still hoping to brief
Sir Robert Morton?

27:20.239 --> 27:21.540
Yes, we're hoping.

27:21.607 --> 27:22.975
That'd take a bit of tin.

27:23.042 --> 27:24.576
Yes, it will.
Uh-huh.

27:26.679 --> 27:30.216
Still, I can't say but
that it isn't a bit of
a slap in the face.

27:30.282 --> 27:31.851
Well, I must thank you,
Dickie, for bearing

27:31.918 --> 27:35.387
what must have
been a very unpleasant
blow with some fortitude.

27:35.454 --> 27:36.956
Oh, nonsense, Father.

27:38.124 --> 27:40.026
(TRAIN ENGINE TOOTING)

28:08.888 --> 28:13.159
Miss Barnes from The Beacon
to see Mr. Arthur Winslow.
I have an appointment.

28:15.161 --> 28:16.395
What a lovely home
you have.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.430
Yes, yes,
it's showing
its age a bit, but...

28:18.497 --> 28:20.332
Mmm-hmm.

28:20.399 --> 28:24.470
My paper usually sends
me out on stories which have
a special interest to women.

28:24.536 --> 28:27.673
Stories with a little heart,
you know, like this one.

28:27.740 --> 28:29.842
A father's fight for
his little boy's honor.

28:29.909 --> 28:33.445
Well, I venture to
think the case has rather
wider implications than that.

28:33.512 --> 28:35.314
Oh, yes, of course.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.516
Now what I'd
really like to do is
to get a nice picture

28:37.583 --> 28:39.185
of you and your
little boy together.

28:39.251 --> 28:41.320
Oh, well,
my son is arriving from
school in a few minutes.

28:41.387 --> 28:43.322
His mother's gone down
to the station to meet him.

28:43.389 --> 28:46.058
From school?
How interesting.

28:46.125 --> 28:47.359
So you got a school
to take him then?

28:47.426 --> 28:49.695
I mean, they didn't
mind the unpleasantness?

28:49.762 --> 28:51.463
ARTHUR: No. Not at all,
not at all.

28:51.530 --> 28:53.199
No question of that.
MISS BARNES: Mmm-hmm.

28:53.265 --> 28:56.635
I find it's extraordinary
how fair-minded people are.

28:57.403 --> 28:59.671
Yes, indeed.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.841
And why is he
coming back this time?

29:01.908 --> 29:04.844
Well, he's not
being expelled again, if
that was your implication.

29:04.911 --> 29:05.978
(CHUCKLES) No.

29:06.045 --> 29:08.047
Well, he is, in fact
doing quite well at school.

29:08.114 --> 29:09.816
Oh, good.

29:09.882 --> 29:12.184
Extraordinarily well,
when you consider
the circumstances.

29:12.251 --> 29:13.685
And why is he
coming back to London?

29:13.752 --> 29:16.488
He's coming to London to be
examined by Sir Robert Morton,

29:16.555 --> 29:17.824
whom we're
hoping to brief.

29:17.890 --> 29:19.826
Oh, Sir Robert Morton?

29:19.892 --> 29:21.828
Do you really think
he'll take a little
case like this?

29:21.894 --> 29:24.063
Oh, this is not
a little case, madam.

29:24.130 --> 29:25.865
Oh, of course not.

29:26.799 --> 29:28.600
Of course not.

29:28.667 --> 29:30.937
Of course it's
not a little case.
Nothing of the sort.

29:32.571 --> 29:35.407
Well, now,

29:35.474 --> 29:37.910
perhaps you wouldn't mind
giving me a few details.

29:37.977 --> 29:39.378
When did it all start?

29:40.312 --> 29:41.680
Four months ago.

29:41.747 --> 29:43.682
Mmm-hmm.

29:43.749 --> 29:46.118
The first
I knew of the charge was
when my son arrived home

29:46.185 --> 29:49.155
with a letter
from the Admiralty
informing me of his expulsion.

29:49.221 --> 29:51.190
I telephoned
Osbourne to protest

29:51.257 --> 29:54.961
and I was referred by them
to the Lords of the Admiralty.

29:55.027 --> 29:57.796
My solicitors then
took the matter up.

29:57.864 --> 30:00.499
We applied
to the Admiralty
for a court-martial.

30:00.566 --> 30:01.934
They ignored us.

30:02.001 --> 30:04.770
We applied
for a civil trial.
They ignored us again.

30:04.837 --> 30:07.139
And after tremendous
pressure had been
brought to bear,

30:07.206 --> 30:09.075
letters to the papers,
questions in the House

30:09.141 --> 30:12.945
and other means
available to private
citizens of this country,

30:13.012 --> 30:14.346
the Admiralty
eventually agreed to

30:14.413 --> 30:16.682
what they called
an independent inquiry.

30:16.748 --> 30:19.185
Oh, good.
It was not good, madam.

30:19.251 --> 30:21.620
At that independent inquiry

30:21.687 --> 30:23.990
conducted by the
Judge Advocate of the Fleet,

30:24.056 --> 30:25.657
against whom I'm
saying nothing,
mind you,

30:25.724 --> 30:28.760
my son, a child of 14,

30:28.827 --> 30:32.398
was not represented by
counsel, solicitors
or friends.

30:32.464 --> 30:34.600
And what happened at
that inquiry?

30:34.666 --> 30:36.035
What do you
think happened?

30:36.102 --> 30:38.737
Inevitably, he was
found guilty again

30:38.804 --> 30:41.707
and branded for
the second time
before the world

30:41.773 --> 30:43.910
as a thief and a forger.

30:43.976 --> 30:46.012
What a shame.

30:46.078 --> 30:49.448
I need hardly tell you,
madam, I am not prepared
to let the matter rest there.

30:49.515 --> 30:53.285
I intend to fight this
monstrous injustice
with every weapon

30:53.352 --> 30:55.421
and every power
at my disposal.

30:55.487 --> 30:57.623
Mmm.
And I have a plan.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.558
I've approached
Sir Robert...

30:59.625 --> 31:01.527
Well, I might say
I have petitioned
Sir Robert Morton...

31:01.593 --> 31:04.897
Oh, what charming curtains.
What are they made of?

31:08.034 --> 31:09.735
Madam, I fear
I have no idea.

31:09.801 --> 31:11.170
(DOOR OPENS)
Ah.

31:11.237 --> 31:12.238
GRACE: Hello.
Is Violet back?

31:12.304 --> 31:13.705
Is that the poor
little chap himself?

31:13.772 --> 31:16.208
Hello, Ronnie.
RONNIE: Hello, Father.

31:16.275 --> 31:20.179
I say, Mr. Moore
says I needn't come back
until Monday, if you like.

31:20.246 --> 31:22.048
So that gives me
three whole days.

31:22.848 --> 31:24.216
How are you, my boy?

31:24.283 --> 31:25.985
Oh, I'm absolutely
tophole, Father.

31:26.052 --> 31:27.553
Mother says
I've grown an inch.

31:27.619 --> 31:30.389
That's the lad.
That's the lad.

31:30.456 --> 31:33.225
That's the lad
we need to get
a picture of.

31:33.292 --> 31:34.726
You said
you wanted to
take it outside.

31:34.793 --> 31:36.195
Yes, take it outside.

31:36.262 --> 31:37.663
Yeah, I only mention
it as the light's going.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.598
Yes. Might we
go to the park?

31:39.665 --> 31:42.969
Do you know, I was thinking,
might we go to the park,
do you think?

31:43.035 --> 31:44.770
You could wear your uniform.

31:44.836 --> 31:47.006
Well, I don't think
that would be a good idea.

31:47.073 --> 31:49.608
MISS BARNES: Well, something
to stress his youth and his...

31:49.675 --> 31:51.077
Do you have
any cricket clothes?

31:51.143 --> 31:52.644
Grace, this lady's from
The Beacon.

31:52.711 --> 31:54.981
She's extremely
interested in your curtains.

31:55.047 --> 31:56.482
Oh, really? How nice.

31:56.548 --> 31:59.451
Yes, indeed.
I was wondering
what they were made of.

31:59.518 --> 32:02.321
Eh, which?
In the drawing room.

32:02.388 --> 32:04.323
Well, they're an entirely
new material, you know.

32:04.390 --> 32:07.359
I'm afraid
I don't know
what it's called.

32:07.426 --> 32:10.662
I got it in Barkers
last year.

32:10.729 --> 32:13.199
Apparently it's a mixture
of silk and velvet.

32:13.265 --> 32:14.866
MAN: We're losing
the light, miss.

32:14.933 --> 32:17.469
Mr. Winslow, if we could,
do you see, put him in
cricket costume?

32:17.536 --> 32:18.770
Do you see?

32:18.837 --> 32:20.839
Something which would say
both youth and England.

32:20.906 --> 32:22.808
ARTHUR: Oh, very well.
I'm gonna set up.

32:22.874 --> 32:25.211
Yes, you set up.
Goodbye, Mr. Winslow.

32:25.277 --> 32:27.946
Very best
of good fortune
in your inspiring fight.

32:28.014 --> 32:29.448
It's very good of you
to talk to me.

32:29.515 --> 32:31.250
I'm sure our readers
would be most interested.

32:31.317 --> 32:33.585
I've found the name
of the material.

32:33.652 --> 32:37.023
Excellent. Excellent.
Marvelous.

32:37.089 --> 32:39.191
That's very kind of you.
GRACE: Not at all.

32:39.258 --> 32:41.427
Ronnie, we'll meet you
in the park.

32:47.433 --> 32:49.501
What's she
talking about?

32:49.568 --> 32:51.170
The case, I imagine.

32:51.237 --> 32:52.571
Oh, the case.

32:52.638 --> 32:55.274
Father, did you know
the train had 14 coaches?

32:55.841 --> 32:57.043
Had it really?

32:57.109 --> 32:59.278
Yes. All corridor.
Remarkable.

33:00.846 --> 33:02.948
I've had your
half-term report, Ronnie.

33:03.015 --> 33:04.050
Oh, yes?

33:04.116 --> 33:06.218
On the whole,
it was pretty fair.

33:06.285 --> 33:07.453
Oh, good.

33:07.519 --> 33:10.356
I'm glad you seem to
be settling down so well.

33:10.422 --> 33:12.091
Yes, thank you, Father.

33:12.158 --> 33:14.326
Father, do you know
how long the train took?
No.

33:14.393 --> 33:15.561
A hundred and
twenty-three miles

33:15.627 --> 33:17.329
in two hours and
fifty-two minutes.

33:17.396 --> 33:21.067
That's an average
of 46.73 miles an hour.

33:21.133 --> 33:23.169
I worked it out.
Well, you worked it out well.

33:23.235 --> 33:24.903
Now, hadn't you better go and
change for the photographer?

33:24.970 --> 33:26.638
Oh, yes. Violet!
Violet's out.

33:26.705 --> 33:27.906
Oh, will you tell her
I'm back?

33:27.973 --> 33:30.076
Yes, I will. Now you need
to go and change.

33:48.994 --> 33:52.531
I found
a new citation
in the law library.

33:52.598 --> 33:54.833
Ronnie's back.
What?

33:54.900 --> 33:56.502
I said, Ronnie's back.

33:56.568 --> 33:57.703
Mmm.

34:00.439 --> 34:01.440
New frock?

34:01.507 --> 34:03.942
Bless you,
I've turned the cuffs.

34:04.009 --> 34:05.944
Turned the cuffs.
What?

34:07.012 --> 34:09.514
No, I said...
I said I like the frock.

34:10.416 --> 34:12.217
Like it, eh?
Yes, I do.

34:12.284 --> 34:13.719
I hope John likes it.

34:15.121 --> 34:16.522
What are you reading?

34:16.588 --> 34:17.789
Admiralty law.

34:17.856 --> 34:20.792
New citation, "Cadet's
right to a first hearing."

34:20.859 --> 34:22.194
Did John telephone?

34:22.261 --> 34:24.230
Things are all right
between you two,
aren't they?

34:24.295 --> 34:26.665
Oh, yes,
Father, of course.
Everything's perfect.

34:26.732 --> 34:28.367
Good, good.

34:28.434 --> 34:30.235
Couldn't be better.

34:31.670 --> 34:32.771
Good.

34:42.947 --> 34:46.418
Kate, are we both mad,
you and I?

34:47.786 --> 34:49.020
Tell me.

34:50.289 --> 34:52.524
Should we drop
the whole thing?

34:54.493 --> 34:57.729
I don't consider that
a serious question.

34:57.796 --> 35:00.566
You realize
your marriage settlement
will have to go, don't you?

35:00.632 --> 35:04.203
Oh, yes. Of course, Father.
I gave that up for lost
weeks ago.

35:04.270 --> 35:06.472
It won't
make any difference,
will it? To you and John?

35:06.538 --> 35:08.174
Good heavens, no.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.809
All right.

35:10.876 --> 35:13.845
Let us pin our faith
on the appearance
of a champion.

35:15.747 --> 35:17.649
You know what I think
of Sir Robert Morton, Father.

35:17.716 --> 35:19.985
Don't let's go into
that again now.

35:20.051 --> 35:21.353
I want the best.

35:21.420 --> 35:23.822
The best in this case
is not Morton.

35:23.889 --> 35:25.524
Then why does
everyone say he is?

35:25.591 --> 35:28.260
Why does everyone
vote for slavery?

35:28.327 --> 35:29.961
He's the best
if one happens to be

35:30.028 --> 35:32.464
a large monopoly
attacking a trade union.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.767
Then he is your lad.

35:35.834 --> 35:37.536
Yes, indeed he is.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.273
Did Mr. Watherstone
telephone, Violet?

35:41.340 --> 35:42.941
I'm sorry, miss.
I just stepped out.

35:43.008 --> 35:44.276
To the best
of my knowledge,
no one's telephoned.

35:44.343 --> 35:45.444
CATHERINE: Thank you.

35:45.511 --> 35:47.246
ARTHUR: Hello, Violet.
Good afternoon, sir.

35:47.313 --> 35:49.948
Well, I imagine
if his heart isn't in it,
he won't accept the brief.

35:50.015 --> 35:53.018
He might still.
It depends what
there is in it for him.

35:53.084 --> 35:54.786
Luckily, there isn't much.

35:54.853 --> 35:57.088
Well, there's a fairly
substantial check.

35:57.155 --> 35:59.725
He doesn't want money.
He must be a very rich man.

35:59.791 --> 36:01.260
(PHONE RINGING)
What does he want then?

36:01.327 --> 36:02.794
That which
advances his interests.

36:02.861 --> 36:04.296
Well, I believe
you're prejudiced

36:04.363 --> 36:06.698
because he spoke
against women's suffrage.

36:06.765 --> 36:07.933
Is that a prejudice
or a position?

36:07.999 --> 36:09.100
Winslow residence.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.269
You tell me.

36:10.336 --> 36:11.770
It's a position.
VIOLET: Yes, sir.

36:11.837 --> 36:14.139
He's always speaking
against what is right.

36:14.206 --> 36:15.241
Mr. Curry, miss.

36:15.307 --> 36:16.642
Mr. Curry.

36:21.980 --> 36:23.715
Hello. Hello, Desmond.

36:23.782 --> 36:24.850
Yes.

36:25.751 --> 36:28.687
What? We... What?

36:28.754 --> 36:31.957
Violet, did we receive
a letter from Mr. Curry?

36:32.023 --> 36:36.094
Yes, I just... Now?
Yes, right. Thank you. Yes.

36:39.265 --> 36:40.566
ARTHUR: What is it, my dear?

36:43.769 --> 36:45.704
Violet, hail us a cab.

36:45.771 --> 36:46.838
Where's Ronnie?

36:46.905 --> 36:48.006
He's in the park.

36:48.073 --> 36:49.808
We'll have to
go without him.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.077
Desmond got us
an appointment
with Sir Robert.

36:52.143 --> 36:53.211
When?

36:53.279 --> 36:54.746
Half an hour ago.

37:24.876 --> 37:25.911
Ah.

37:25.977 --> 37:27.379
We only have just
a very few moments.

37:27.446 --> 37:28.814
I'm so sorry.
We didn't get your note.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.215
He has an important...

37:30.282 --> 37:33.051
A most important
dinner engagement, sir.

37:33.118 --> 37:34.286
Where is the boy?

37:34.353 --> 37:36.788
He'll be along with
my wife in a few moments.

37:36.855 --> 37:37.989
I'm afraid
he can only spare us

37:38.056 --> 37:39.325
a very few moments
of his time.

37:39.391 --> 37:40.959
I assure you
we're conscious of it.

37:41.026 --> 37:42.594
Catherine, you'd
better go on ahead.

37:42.661 --> 37:45.531
Explain why we're late.
Make our apologies.
Go now.

37:48.700 --> 37:50.736
Catherine!

37:50.802 --> 37:52.471
It's straight on
through that doorway,

37:52.538 --> 37:53.739
up the stairs
and to your left.

37:53.805 --> 37:55.173
Thank you.

38:07.853 --> 38:09.555
Excuse me, please.

38:18.964 --> 38:21.767
Miss Catherine Winslow.
The Winslow case.

38:22.668 --> 38:23.702
We understood that...

38:23.769 --> 38:25.704
They're coming.

38:25.771 --> 38:27.506
"They're coming"?

38:27.573 --> 38:30.008
We didn't hear of
the appointment until...

38:30.075 --> 38:31.977
Miss Catherine Winslow.

38:34.513 --> 38:36.214
I beg your pardon.

38:38.850 --> 38:43.088
I suppose
you know the history of
this case, do you, Sir Robert?

38:43.154 --> 38:45.624
I believe
I've seen most of
the relevant documents.

38:45.691 --> 38:48.193
CATHERINE: Yes.
Yes, excellent.

38:50.095 --> 38:54.232
Do you think
we can bring the case into
court by a collusive action?

38:54.299 --> 38:57.102
I really have no idea.

38:57.168 --> 38:59.938
Curry and Curry seem
to think that might hold.

39:00.005 --> 39:03.241
Do they? They are
a very reliable firm.

39:08.279 --> 39:09.481
Robert Morton.

39:09.548 --> 39:12.951
Catherine Winslow.

39:13.018 --> 39:15.787
Mr. Michaels, if I could
have your attention on
that other matter.

39:15.854 --> 39:17.288
MICHAELS: Yes, sir.

39:18.156 --> 39:19.558
There...

39:19.625 --> 39:21.292
I hope you
don't mind if I...

39:21.359 --> 39:23.061
What could be
more absurd than
your asking me permission

39:23.128 --> 39:24.996
to smoke in
your establishment?

39:25.063 --> 39:27.566
Well, it is the custom.
I indulge, myself.

39:27.633 --> 39:29.300
Yes, sir.
Indeed?

39:29.367 --> 39:32.137
Some people
find that shocking.

39:32.203 --> 39:35.607
Amazing how
little it takes to offend
the world's sensibilities.

39:35.674 --> 39:37.208
No, thank you.

39:39.010 --> 39:40.879
My father and brother
will be here in a moment.

39:40.946 --> 39:42.180
What time are you dining?

39:43.715 --> 39:44.916
8:00.

39:44.983 --> 39:46.184
Far from here?

39:46.251 --> 39:48.219
Devonshire House.

39:48.286 --> 39:50.722
Oh. Well, then,
of course, you mustn't
on any account be late.

39:50.789 --> 39:52.824
No.

39:52.891 --> 39:55.026
I'm rather surprised
that a case of this sort

39:55.093 --> 39:57.095
should interest you,
Sir Robert.

39:57.162 --> 39:58.329
Are you?

39:58.396 --> 39:59.998
It seems such
a very trivial affair

40:00.065 --> 40:03.635
compared to most of your
great forensic triumphs.

40:03.702 --> 40:06.404
I was in court during your
prosecution of Len Rogers

40:06.472 --> 40:09.107
in the Trades Union
Embezzlement case.

40:09.174 --> 40:10.341
Really?

40:10.408 --> 40:12.143
Magnificently done.

40:13.111 --> 40:14.480
Thank you.

40:14.546 --> 40:17.549
I suppose you heard that
he committed suicide
a few months ago?

40:17.616 --> 40:19.150
Yes, I had heard.

40:19.217 --> 40:21.787
Many people believed
him innocent, you know.

40:21.853 --> 40:23.421
So I understand.

40:23.489 --> 40:25.757
As it happens, however,
he was guilty.

40:25.824 --> 40:27.325
(DOOR OPENING)

40:29.528 --> 40:30.962
Ah, Sir Robert.

40:31.029 --> 40:33.465
ARTHUR: Sir Robert,
Sir Robert.
Sir Robert, I'm sorry.

40:33.532 --> 40:34.666
I am so sorry
to keep you waiting.

40:34.733 --> 40:36.468
DESMOND: Arthur Winslow.

40:36.535 --> 40:38.804
I'm so sorry.
We didn't get your note.

40:38.870 --> 40:40.238
That's perfectly all right.

40:40.305 --> 40:42.574
Sir Robert is dining
at Devonshire House.

40:42.641 --> 40:45.811
Yes, yes, yes, I see.
I know that you're
pressed for time, sir.

40:45.877 --> 40:48.514
My son will be along
at any moment.

40:48.580 --> 40:50.982
I assume that you
want to examine him.

40:51.049 --> 40:52.350
Just a few questions.

40:52.417 --> 40:54.720
I fear
that is all I will
have time for this evening.

40:55.887 --> 40:57.756
I'm sorry to hear it.

40:57.823 --> 40:59.525
My son has made
the journey from school

40:59.591 --> 41:00.992
especially in the
hope of being interviewed.

41:01.059 --> 41:03.061
And I had hoped that,
by the end of it,

41:03.128 --> 41:06.498
I should know definitely yes
or no whether you would
accept the brief.

41:06.565 --> 41:08.734
You, of course,
understand my anxiety.

41:08.800 --> 41:11.036
Well, perhaps
Sir Robert would consent

41:11.102 --> 41:14.072
to finish
his examination
some other time.

41:14.139 --> 41:15.707
It might be arranged.

41:15.774 --> 41:16.942
Tomorrow?

41:18.677 --> 41:20.979
Tomorrow is impossible.
I'm in court all the morning

41:21.046 --> 41:23.014
and in the
House of Commons
for the rest of the day.

41:23.582 --> 41:25.450
I see.

41:25.517 --> 41:27.352
Curry tells me you
think it might be possible

41:27.418 --> 41:28.954
to proceed by
Petition of Right.

41:29.020 --> 41:30.789
Would you mind
if I sat down, sir?

41:30.856 --> 41:32.057
Please, just...

41:32.123 --> 41:33.525
What is a Petition of Right?

41:33.592 --> 41:36.327
Well, granting the
assumption that
the Admiralty,

41:36.394 --> 41:38.163
as the Crown,
can do no wrong...

41:38.229 --> 41:40.866
I thought that was exactly
the assumption we refused
to grant.

41:40.932 --> 41:44.402
In law, I mean. Now,
a subject can sue
the Crown

41:44.469 --> 41:46.872
nevertheless, by
Petition of Right.

41:46.938 --> 41:48.607
Petition of Right, yes?

41:48.674 --> 41:51.476
Redress being granted
as a matter of grace.

41:51.543 --> 41:54.746
And the custom is
for the Attorney General,

41:54.813 --> 41:57.883
on behalf of the Crown,
to endorse the petition

41:57.949 --> 42:00.285
and allow the case to
come to court.

42:00.351 --> 42:05.156
It is interesting to
note that the exact words
he uses on such occasions

42:05.223 --> 42:07.793
are, "Let right be done."

42:07.859 --> 42:11.897
"Let right be done."
I like that phrase, sir.

42:11.963 --> 42:14.566
It has a certain ring
about it, has it not?

42:14.633 --> 42:15.767
"Let right be done."

42:15.834 --> 42:16.902
MICHAELS: This way, please.

42:16.968 --> 42:18.369
ARTHUR: Oh, Grace.
This is Sir Robert.

42:18.436 --> 42:22.140
That's my wife.
And this is Ronnie.

42:22.207 --> 42:24.576
Ronnie, Sir Robert is going
to ask you a few questions,

42:24.643 --> 42:27.145
which you must
answer truthfully,
as you always have done.

42:27.212 --> 42:28.814
I expect you'd
like us to leave.

42:28.880 --> 42:32.083
No, no.
Provided, of course,
you don't interrupt.

42:34.786 --> 42:36.888
Would you sit down, please?

42:47.966 --> 42:49.067
Hello, Mother.

42:49.134 --> 42:50.301
Hello.

42:52.604 --> 42:54.005
Sorry we're so late.

42:54.072 --> 42:56.207
That's all right.
Nothing's happened at all.

42:58.243 --> 43:00.245
Will you stand here facing me?

43:02.848 --> 43:04.149
That's right.

43:05.583 --> 43:08.553
Now, Ronald,
how old are you?

43:08.620 --> 43:10.188
Fourteen and two months.

43:10.255 --> 43:12.758
You were then,
13 and 10 months old

43:12.824 --> 43:15.026
when you left Osbourne,
is that right?

43:15.093 --> 43:16.161
Yes, sir.

43:16.227 --> 43:17.863
Now, I would like
to cast your mind back

43:17.929 --> 43:20.431
to December the seventh,
of last year.

43:20.498 --> 43:21.767
Would you tell me,
in your own words,

43:21.833 --> 43:23.869
exactly what happened to you
on that day.

43:25.103 --> 43:26.304
It was half-holiday,

43:26.371 --> 43:28.439
so we didn't have
any work after dinner.

43:28.506 --> 43:30.108
SIR ROBERT: Dinner at 1:00?

43:30.175 --> 43:33.011
Yes, at least
until prep at 7:00.

43:33.078 --> 43:34.980
Prep at 7:00, mmm-hmm.

43:35.046 --> 43:37.182
Well, then,
just before dinner

43:37.248 --> 43:39.250
I went along to the
Chief Petty Officer

43:39.317 --> 43:43.188
and asked him to let me
have fifteen and six out of
what I had in the school bank.

43:43.254 --> 43:44.656
Why did you do that?

43:44.723 --> 43:45.824
I wanted to
buy an air pistol.

43:45.891 --> 43:47.893
Which cost fifteen and six?

43:47.959 --> 43:49.527
Yes, sir.

43:49.594 --> 43:51.429
And how much money did you
have in the school bank
at the time?

43:51.496 --> 43:52.764
Two pounds, three shillings.

43:52.831 --> 43:54.966
So you see, what incentive
could he possibly have...

43:55.033 --> 43:58.603
I must ask you
to be good enough
not to interrupt me, sir.

44:03.574 --> 44:07.679
After you had withdrawn
the fifteen and six,
what did you do?

44:07.746 --> 44:09.014
I had dinner.

44:09.080 --> 44:10.849
Then what?

44:10.916 --> 44:14.552
Then I went to the locker room
and put my fifteen and six
away in my locker.

44:14.619 --> 44:17.923
Then I went to
go and get permission
to go to the post office.

44:17.989 --> 44:19.524
Yes?

44:19.590 --> 44:22.293
Then I went back
to the locker room,

44:22.360 --> 44:25.263
again got out my money and
went down to the post office.

44:25.330 --> 44:26.631
Yes, go on.

44:26.698 --> 44:29.034
Then I bought
my postal order.

44:29.100 --> 44:30.368
For fifteen and six?

44:30.435 --> 44:31.703
Yes, sir.

44:31.770 --> 44:33.371
Then I went back to college.

44:33.438 --> 44:35.140
Then I met Elliot minor.

44:35.206 --> 44:37.142
And he said,
"I say, isn't it rot?

44:37.208 --> 44:39.544
"Someone's broken into
my locker and pinched
a postal order.

44:39.610 --> 44:41.412
"I've reported it
to the PO."

44:41.479 --> 44:44.615
And those were
Elliot minor's
exact words?

44:44.682 --> 44:46.952
He might have used
another word for rot.

44:48.119 --> 44:51.056
I see. Continue.

44:51.122 --> 44:54.559
Well, then, just before prep,
I was told to go along and
see Commander Flower.

44:54.625 --> 44:56.594
The woman from the
post office was there.

44:56.661 --> 44:59.064
And the Commander said,
"Is this the boy?"

44:59.130 --> 45:01.066
And she said, "It might be.
I can't be sure.

45:01.132 --> 45:02.734
"They all look
so much alike."

45:02.801 --> 45:04.870
ARTHUR: You see,
she couldn't identify him.

45:06.071 --> 45:08.006
Go on.

45:08.073 --> 45:11.142
Then she said,
"I only know that the boy
who bought a postal order

45:11.209 --> 45:12.610
"for fifteen and six

45:12.677 --> 45:15.213
"was the
same boy who cashed
one for five shillings."

45:15.280 --> 45:17.015
So the Commander said,

45:17.082 --> 45:18.984
"Did you
buy a postal order
for fifteen and six?"

45:19.050 --> 45:20.485
And I said, "Yes."

45:20.551 --> 45:22.788
And then he made me write
Elliot's name on an envelope

45:22.854 --> 45:25.757
and compared it to the
signature on the postal order.

45:25.824 --> 45:28.827
Then they sent me
to the sanatorium and
10 days later I was sacked.

45:28.894 --> 45:30.762
I mean, expelled.

45:30.829 --> 45:32.898
I see.

45:32.964 --> 45:36.467
Did you cash a postal order
belonging Elliot minor
for five shillings?

45:36.534 --> 45:37.769
No, sir.

45:37.836 --> 45:39.470
Did you break into
his locker and steal it?

45:39.537 --> 45:40.638
No, sir.

45:40.705 --> 45:42.073
And that is the truth,

45:42.140 --> 45:44.542
the whole truth and
nothing but the truth?

45:44.609 --> 45:45.743
Yes, sir.

45:48.246 --> 45:49.414
Right.

45:52.250 --> 45:53.919
The files, please.

45:55.453 --> 45:57.856
This has
just come down
from Ridgeley-Pearce.

45:57.923 --> 45:59.257
SIR ROBERT: Thank you.

46:03.761 --> 46:06.998
When the
Commander asked you to write
Elliot's name on an envelope,

46:07.065 --> 46:09.434
how did you write it?
With Christian name
or initials?

46:09.500 --> 46:12.237
I wrote,
"Charles K. Elliot."

46:12.303 --> 46:14.072
Charles K. Elliot.

46:14.139 --> 46:15.540
And did you by any chance
happen to see the forged
postal order

46:15.606 --> 46:16.808
in the Commander's office?

46:16.875 --> 46:20.078
Yes, sir.
The Commander
showed it to me.

46:20.145 --> 46:22.147
Before or after you had
written Elliot's name
on the envelope?

46:22.213 --> 46:24.682
After.
After.

46:24.749 --> 46:27.685
And did you happen to
see how Elliot's name was
written on the postal order?

46:27.752 --> 46:29.220
RONNIE: Yes, sir, the same.

46:29.287 --> 46:31.422
SIR ROBERT: The same.

46:31.489 --> 46:33.158
"Charles K. Elliot."

46:33.892 --> 46:35.293
RONNIE: Yes.

46:38.796 --> 46:40.331
When you wrote
on the envelope,

46:40.398 --> 46:42.633
what made you choose
that particular form?

46:42.700 --> 46:44.702
Well, that was the way
he usually signed his name.

46:44.769 --> 46:46.171
How did you know?

46:46.237 --> 46:47.738
Well, he was
a great friend of mine.

46:47.805 --> 46:49.507
That is no answer.
How did you know?

46:49.574 --> 46:51.542
I'd seen him sign things.
What things?

46:51.609 --> 46:53.011
Oh, ordinary things.

46:53.078 --> 46:54.880
I repeat. What things?

46:55.613 --> 46:57.082
Bits of paper.

46:57.148 --> 46:59.851
Bits of paper.
Why did he sign his
name on bits of paper?

46:59.918 --> 47:01.252
He was practicing
his signature.

47:01.319 --> 47:03.121
And you saw him?
Yes.

47:03.188 --> 47:04.555
Did he know you saw him?

47:04.622 --> 47:06.257
Well, yes.

47:06.324 --> 47:08.759
In other words,
he showed you exactly
how he wrote his signature?

47:08.826 --> 47:11.262
Yes, I suppose he did.

47:11.329 --> 47:13.231
Did you practice
writing it yourself?

47:14.665 --> 47:16.234
I might have done.

47:16.301 --> 47:18.003
What do you mean,
you might have done?
Did you or did you not?

47:18.069 --> 47:19.204
Yes.

47:19.270 --> 47:21.106
Ronnie. You never
told me that.

47:21.172 --> 47:22.407
It was only for a joke.

47:22.473 --> 47:24.075
SIR ROBERT: Never mind
if it was for a joke or not.

47:24.142 --> 47:27.112
The fact is, you practiced
forging Elliot's signature.

47:27.178 --> 47:28.246
It wasn't forging.

47:28.313 --> 47:29.948
What do you call it then?
Writing.

47:30.015 --> 47:31.582
Whoever stole the
postal order and
cashed it

47:31.649 --> 47:34.252
also wrote Elliot's
signature, didn't he?

47:34.685 --> 47:35.853
Yes.

47:35.921 --> 47:37.488
And oddly enough,
in the exact form

47:37.555 --> 47:39.590
in which you had earlier
been practicing writing
his signature.

47:39.657 --> 47:41.993
I say,
which side are you on?

47:42.060 --> 47:44.195
MICHAELS: Yes. All right.

47:44.262 --> 47:47.298
Are you aware...

47:47.365 --> 47:50.501
Are you aware that
the Admiralty sent up
the forged postal order

47:50.568 --> 47:52.270
to Mr. Ridgeley-Pearce,

47:52.337 --> 47:54.472
the greatest handwriting
expert in England?

47:54.539 --> 47:55.606
Yes.

47:55.673 --> 47:56.841
You are aware of that?

47:56.908 --> 47:58.743
And you know that
Mr. Ridgeley-Pearce affirmed

47:58.809 --> 48:01.246
that there was no doubt
that the signature on
the postal order

48:01.312 --> 48:04.682
and the signature which
you wrote on the envelope
were by one and the same hand?

48:04.749 --> 48:06.117
Yes.

48:06.184 --> 48:08.153
And you still say
you didn't forge
that signature?

48:08.219 --> 48:09.520
Yes, I do.

48:09.587 --> 48:12.157
In other words,
Mr. Ridgeley-Pearce
doesn't know his job?

48:12.223 --> 48:14.025
Well, he's wrong, anyway.

48:14.092 --> 48:15.927
MICHAELS: Is he indeed?

48:15.994 --> 48:18.196
Are you aware that the
government is in possession

48:18.263 --> 48:20.932
of 17 separate examples
of your handwriting

48:20.999 --> 48:23.834
and that a board of
government experts
has identified them

48:23.901 --> 48:28.539
as identical
with the signature
of Charles K. Elliot?

48:28.606 --> 48:31.977
When you went into
the locker room after
dinner, were you alone?

48:32.043 --> 48:34.012
I don't remember.

48:34.079 --> 48:36.381
I think you do. Were you
alone in the locker room?

48:36.447 --> 48:37.582
Yes.

48:37.648 --> 48:39.150
And you knew
which was Elliot's locker?

48:39.217 --> 48:40.518
Yes, of course.

48:40.585 --> 48:42.020
Why did you go
in there at all?

48:42.087 --> 48:43.521
I've told you. To put
my fifteen and six away.

48:43.588 --> 48:45.256
Why?
I thought it would be safer.

48:45.323 --> 48:46.791
Why safer than your pocket?

48:46.857 --> 48:48.726
I don't know.

48:48.793 --> 48:51.829
What time did Elliot
put his postal order
in his locker?

48:51.896 --> 48:54.432
I don't know.
I didn't even know he
had a postal order at all.

48:54.499 --> 48:56.634
What time did you
go to the locker room?

48:56.701 --> 48:58.603
I don't remember.
Was it directly after dinner?

48:58.669 --> 48:59.837
Yes, I think so.

48:59.904 --> 49:01.639
What did you do after
leaving the locker room?

49:01.706 --> 49:04.109
I've told you.
I went to get permission
to go down to the post office.

49:04.175 --> 49:05.210
What time was that?

49:05.276 --> 49:06.311
About a quarter past two.

49:06.377 --> 49:07.845
But dinner is over
at a quarter to two

49:07.912 --> 49:10.248
which means you were
in the locker room
for half an hour.

49:10.315 --> 49:12.317
I wasn't in there
all that time.

49:12.383 --> 49:13.684
How long were you there?

49:13.751 --> 49:15.053
About five minutes.

49:15.120 --> 49:16.821
What were you doing for
the other 25?

49:16.887 --> 49:19.690
I don't remember. Perhaps
I waited outside the
CO's office.

49:19.757 --> 49:21.759
And no one
saw you there either?

49:21.826 --> 49:24.462
I remember.
I remember someone did see
me outside the CO's office.

49:24.529 --> 49:26.697
A chap called Casey.
I spoke to him.

49:26.764 --> 49:28.266
What did you say?

49:28.333 --> 49:29.667
I said,
"Come down to the
post office with me.

49:29.734 --> 49:31.502
"I'm going to
cash a postal order."

49:34.639 --> 49:36.507
Cash a postal order?

49:40.845 --> 49:42.247
I mean, get.

49:42.313 --> 49:45.150
You said cash. Why did you
say cash if you meant get?

49:46.517 --> 49:47.885
I don't know.

49:47.952 --> 49:49.920
I suggest cash was the truth.

49:49.987 --> 49:52.223
No, no,
it wasn't really.
You're muddling me.

49:52.290 --> 49:55.093
You seem easily muddled.
How many other lies
have you told?

49:55.160 --> 49:56.594
None. Really, I haven't.

49:56.661 --> 49:58.363
I suggest your whole
testimony is a lie.

49:58.429 --> 49:59.797
No, it's the truth!

49:59.864 --> 50:02.100
I suggest
there is barely one
single word of truth

50:02.167 --> 50:04.202
in anything
you said either to me
or to the Judge Advocate

50:04.269 --> 50:05.570
or to the Commander.

50:05.636 --> 50:07.505
I suggest
that you broke
into Elliot's locker.

50:07.572 --> 50:09.974
That you stole the postal
order for five shillings
belonging to Elliot.

50:10.041 --> 50:12.009
That you cashed it by
means of forging his name.

50:12.077 --> 50:13.244
I didn't. I didn't.

50:13.311 --> 50:14.845
I suggest that
you did it for a joke,

50:14.912 --> 50:16.514
meaning to give Elliot
the five shillings back

50:16.581 --> 50:18.249
but then when you met him
and he said he'd reported
the matter,

50:18.316 --> 50:20.085
you got frightened
and decided to keep quiet.

50:20.151 --> 50:23.754
No! No!
It isn't true!
It isn't true!

50:23.821 --> 50:25.323
None of it's true!

50:25.390 --> 50:27.392
I suggest
that by continuing
to deny your guilt

50:27.458 --> 50:29.227
you are causing great
hardship to your family

50:29.294 --> 50:32.297
and considerable annoyance to
high and important persons in
this country.

50:32.363 --> 50:34.765
That's a disgraceful thing
to say.

50:34.832 --> 50:36.801
I suggest
that the time
has at last come

50:36.867 --> 50:38.969
for you to undo some of
the misery you have caused

50:39.036 --> 50:42.006
by confessing to us all now
that you're a forger,
a liar and a thief!

50:42.073 --> 50:43.341
CATHERINE: How dare you!

50:43.408 --> 50:45.176
I'm not. I'm not.
I didn't do it!

50:45.243 --> 50:46.677
This is outrageous, sir.

50:46.744 --> 50:47.812
RONNIE: I didn't do any of it.

50:47.878 --> 50:49.314
GRACE: It's all right, love.

50:49.380 --> 50:50.748
It's all right.
It's all right.

50:50.815 --> 50:52.317
Curry, can I drop
you anywhere?

50:53.284 --> 50:54.919
No, I...

51:02.460 --> 51:04.562
Send all of his files
here by tomorrow morning.

51:06.297 --> 51:08.499
But will you need them now?

51:08.566 --> 51:10.668
Oh, yes. The boy
is plainly innocent.

51:13.404 --> 51:15.173
I accept the brief.

51:50.341 --> 51:52.076
FIRST LORD: If we may...

51:52.143 --> 51:52.810
SIR ROBERT: Get this
to the First Lord,
will you?

51:52.877 --> 51:54.712
MESSENGER: Yes, sir.

51:54.779 --> 51:57.748
The chief
point of criticism
against the Admiralty

51:57.815 --> 52:01.686
appears to center in
the purely legal question

52:01.752 --> 52:04.489
of the Petition of Right
brought by a member.

52:04.555 --> 52:06.757
MEMBER 1: Hear, hear.

52:06.824 --> 52:10.027
A citizen seeking redress of
the Petition of Right and
the demurrer thereto.

52:10.094 --> 52:11.529
MEMBER 2: Nonsense!

52:11.596 --> 52:14.265
FIRST LORD:
This member has made
great play of this boy

52:14.332 --> 52:16.901
with his eloquence
and address.

52:16.967 --> 52:18.836
MEMBER 3: Yes.

52:18.903 --> 52:20.771
MEMBER 4: Quite right.

52:23.274 --> 52:25.410
And I was moved

52:25.476 --> 52:30.181
as any honorable
member opposite by his
resonant use of the words,

52:30.248 --> 52:32.417
"Let right be done,"

52:32.483 --> 52:36.120
the time-honored phrase
with which, in his opinion,

52:36.187 --> 52:38.723
the Attorney General
should, without question,

52:38.789 --> 52:42.893
have supported Mr. Winslow's
Petition of Right.

52:42.960 --> 52:45.830
Now, it is not
unpleasant to beguile...

52:45.896 --> 52:48.833
All right, all right.
Let's break it down
into its essentials.

52:48.899 --> 52:51.736
Do we have enough votes
to put the question?

52:51.802 --> 52:53.371
How important
is it to you, Bobby?

52:53.438 --> 52:55.105
How important is it?

52:55.172 --> 52:56.741
Ah, well,
it's only important to win.

52:56.807 --> 52:58.843
MAN: Shouldn't you
be in that House?

52:58.909 --> 53:01.846
It's like he's repeating
himself forever.

53:01.912 --> 53:04.081
Give me a piece of paper.

53:04.148 --> 53:06.384
Am I missing
something here?

53:06.451 --> 53:08.919
The thing is the votes.

53:08.986 --> 53:11.356
Well, yes, well.

53:11.422 --> 53:13.190
What do you
say to that, Tony?
Do we have the votes?

53:13.258 --> 53:15.426
Say? Do we have the votes?

53:15.493 --> 53:16.927
Well, I'd say,
do we have the money?

53:16.994 --> 53:18.396
The answer's perhaps.

53:18.463 --> 53:21.466
The point is,
do you really want
to spend it on this?

53:21.532 --> 53:24.535
Pardon me.
Let me just have
a quick look, miss.

53:25.403 --> 53:26.571
Can you bring it to a vote?

53:26.637 --> 53:28.005
Can you bring
it to a vote, Tony?

53:28.072 --> 53:30.775
Perhaps I can.
End of the day,
it's a 12-year-old boy.

53:51.329 --> 53:52.430
Excuse me, sir.

53:52.497 --> 53:53.764
You're sure
you want to fight it, Bob?

53:53.831 --> 53:55.165
I wouldn't ask you
if I weren't.

53:55.232 --> 53:56.967
I'm saying,
before we start
calling in markers.

53:57.034 --> 53:58.769
All Dick's saying is,
choose your ground, Bob.

53:58.836 --> 54:00.771
I hear you.
Because there's
no honorable retreat.

54:00.838 --> 54:02.740
If you pick this up,
you're gonna have
to carry it.

54:02.807 --> 54:04.675
Because it's your
best interest, Bobby.
That's the thing.

54:04.742 --> 54:06.210
I understand.

54:08.946 --> 54:12.483
FIRST LORD:
The battles have raged
since the days of Greece

54:12.550 --> 54:16.053
and our poor efforts
here today will not
arrest it.

54:16.120 --> 54:21.526
What can we profit for this
age-old and, if I may,
ceremonial contest?

54:21.592 --> 54:23.093
MEMBER 5: Not so, not so.

54:23.160 --> 54:26.531
Yes, that I made clear.
And I find, looking around,

54:26.597 --> 54:28.433
that in this chamber,
our friends...
MEMBER 6: Utter nonsense.

54:28.499 --> 54:29.800
...in the loyal opposition...

54:29.867 --> 54:31.135
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

54:31.201 --> 54:33.070
FIRST LORD:
...for make no mistake.

54:33.137 --> 54:35.139
But though the loser
in this...

54:35.205 --> 54:36.507
What did I miss?

54:36.574 --> 54:38.709
You didn't miss anything.

54:38.776 --> 54:40.411
FIRST LORD: The winner
can never, never...

54:40.478 --> 54:41.946
What's going on?

54:42.012 --> 54:44.382
He was just saying how
all the great crimes
are committed

54:44.449 --> 54:47.284
in the name of
public tranquility.

54:47.352 --> 54:51.722
FIRST LORD: And we respond,
yes, when the State gains,

54:51.789 --> 54:55.460
when the State gains
and only then.

55:22.052 --> 55:23.854
GRACE: Close the book now.

55:31.562 --> 55:33.731
Is everything all right?

55:33.798 --> 55:35.466
Everything's fine.

55:36.100 --> 55:37.735
Go to sleep now.

55:38.503 --> 55:39.670
Good night, Mother.

55:39.737 --> 55:41.138
Good night.

55:47.011 --> 55:49.414
Good night, Ronnie.
Sleep well.

55:49.480 --> 55:50.848
Good night.

55:54.018 --> 55:57.121
I fancy this might be
a good opportunity of
talking to Violet.

55:57.187 --> 55:59.056
I'll do it one day, Arthur.
Tomorrow, perhaps. Not now.

55:59.123 --> 56:00.825
I think
you'd do better
to grasp the nettle.

56:00.891 --> 56:02.760
Delay only adds
to your worries.

56:02.827 --> 56:04.462
My worries?
What do you know
about my worries?

56:04.529 --> 56:06.130
A good deal, Grace.

56:06.196 --> 56:07.598
But I think
they would be
a lot lessened

56:07.665 --> 56:10.535
if you faced the
situation squarely.

56:10.601 --> 56:12.737
It won't
be easy for her
to find another place.

56:12.803 --> 56:16.273
The facts at this moment
are that we have half
of the income

56:16.340 --> 56:19.810
we had a year ago and
we're living at nearly
the same rate.

56:19.877 --> 56:23.080
Whichever way you look
at it, it's bad economics.

56:23.147 --> 56:26.984
I'm not talking
about economics, Arthur.
I'm talking about our life.

56:27.051 --> 56:28.786
Things we took for granted
a year ago now,

56:28.853 --> 56:30.287
which don't seem
to matter anymore.

56:30.354 --> 56:32.022
Such as?

56:32.089 --> 56:36.861
Such as a happy
home and anonymity and
an ordinary, respectable life.

56:36.927 --> 56:39.096
There's your return for it,
I suppose.

56:39.163 --> 56:40.865
I only pray to God
you know what you're doing.

56:40.931 --> 56:42.199
I know exactly
what I am doing, Grace.

56:42.266 --> 56:43.333
Do you, Arthur?

56:44.535 --> 56:45.870
He's perfectly happy.

56:45.936 --> 56:48.639
He's at a good school.
He's doing very well.

56:48.706 --> 56:50.675
No one need ever have known
about Osbourne if you hadn't

56:50.741 --> 56:53.811
shouted it out
to the whole world.

56:53.878 --> 56:55.245
As it is,
whatever happens now,

56:55.312 --> 56:57.448
he'll be known as the boy
who stole that postal order.

56:57.515 --> 56:59.984
He didn't steal it, Grace.

57:00.050 --> 57:02.720
You talk
about sacrificing
everything for him.

57:02.787 --> 57:05.355
When he's grown up,
he won't thank you
for it, Arthur.

57:05.422 --> 57:08.325
Even though you've given
your life to publish
his innocence,

57:08.392 --> 57:09.927
as you call it.

57:11.596 --> 57:13.964
Yes, Arthur. Your life.

57:14.031 --> 57:17.602
You talk gaily about
arthritis and a touch of gout.

57:17.668 --> 57:20.905
You know better than any of
the doctors what's the
matter with you.

57:20.971 --> 57:24.775
You're destroying yourself,
Arthur, and me, and your
family besides.

57:24.842 --> 57:27.011
For what, I'd like to know?
For what?

57:28.212 --> 57:30.247
For justice, Grace.

57:30.314 --> 57:32.783
Are you sure that's true?

57:32.850 --> 57:35.953
Are you sure it isn't
pride and self-importance?

57:38.589 --> 57:42.059
No, I don't think so.
I really don't think so.

57:42.126 --> 57:46.497
No, I'm not going
to cry and say I'm sorry
and make things up again.

57:46.564 --> 57:48.265
I can stand anything if
there is a reason for it.

57:48.332 --> 57:52.537
But for no reason at all,
it's unfair to ask
so much of me.

57:52.603 --> 57:54.271
It's unfair!

57:54.338 --> 57:55.840
(DOOR OPENING)

57:55.906 --> 57:58.676
What's the matter, Father?

57:58.743 --> 58:02.046
Your mother's
a little upset, that's all.

58:02.112 --> 58:03.981
Why? Aren't things
going very well?

58:04.048 --> 58:06.083
Yes. Everything's
going very well.

58:06.150 --> 58:09.053
You go on back to bed.
Go to sleep. Good night.

58:14.825 --> 58:17.027
Thank you very much.
Here you are.

58:20.998 --> 58:22.366
Off you go.

58:44.154 --> 58:45.723
Thank you, Violet.

58:48.826 --> 58:51.528
How long have you
been with us, Violet?

58:51.596 --> 58:53.263
Twenty-four years
come April, sir.

58:53.330 --> 58:55.032
Is it as long as that?
Yes, sir.

58:55.099 --> 58:56.934
Miss Kate was that high
when I first come in.

58:57.001 --> 58:59.469
Mr. Dickie hadn't
even been thought of.

59:00.738 --> 59:03.373
What do you think
of this case, Violet?

59:03.440 --> 59:05.542
Fine old rumpus that is,
sir, and no mistake.

59:05.610 --> 59:07.745
Yes, it is indeed
a fine old rumpus.

59:07.812 --> 59:09.847
There was a bit
in the Evening News.
Did you read it, sir?

59:09.914 --> 59:11.716
No, I didn't.
What did it say?

59:11.782 --> 59:16.353
Oh, how it was a fuss about
nothing, shocking waste of
the government's time.

59:16.420 --> 59:18.022
But how it was
a good thing all the same,

59:18.088 --> 59:20.658
because it could
only happen in England.

59:20.725 --> 59:23.260
There seems
a strange lack of
logic in that argument.

59:23.327 --> 59:26.196
Well, perhaps they put
it a bit different, sir.

59:26.263 --> 59:28.165
Still, that's what it said,
all right.

59:28.232 --> 59:30.034
When you think
it's all because
of our Master Ronnie,

59:30.100 --> 59:32.036
I have to laugh
about it sometimes.

59:32.102 --> 59:33.938
Really, I do.

59:34.004 --> 59:37.307
Wasting the
government's time
at his age. I never did.

59:37.374 --> 59:38.676
Wonders will never cease.

59:40.177 --> 59:42.346
No, wonders
will never cease.

59:44.682 --> 59:47.451
Well, will that be all, sir?

59:50.688 --> 59:52.322
Yes, Violet, that'll be all.

01:00:08.305 --> 01:00:09.640
CATHERINE:
Good evening, Violet.
VIOLET: Good evening, miss.

01:00:09.707 --> 01:00:11.876
Catherine.
Hello, Father.

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:13.177
Hello.

01:00:13.243 --> 01:00:14.311
How are you?

01:00:14.378 --> 01:00:15.946
Slinking down alleyways.

01:00:16.013 --> 01:00:18.548
Are they still camping
out in the street, then?

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:20.685
Oh, yes.

01:00:20.751 --> 01:00:22.486
So how'd you
get on this evening?

01:00:22.552 --> 01:00:24.088
Are those for me?
Yes.

01:00:24.154 --> 01:00:25.489
Thank you.

01:00:25.555 --> 01:00:27.357
Well, what happened?
Is the debate over?

01:00:27.424 --> 01:00:28.525
As good as.

01:00:28.592 --> 01:00:30.260
The First Lord
gave an assurance

01:00:30.327 --> 01:00:33.030
that in the future there
would be no inquiry at
Osbourne or Dartmouth

01:00:33.097 --> 01:00:35.232
without informing
the parents first.

01:00:35.299 --> 01:00:37.067
That seemed to
satisfy most members.

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:40.070
Well, what about our case?
Is he going to allow us
a fair trial?

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:42.106
Apparently not.

01:00:42.172 --> 01:00:44.474
But that's iniquitous.
I thought he'd be
forced to.

01:00:44.541 --> 01:00:48.779
I thought so too.
The House, evidently,
thought otherwise.

01:00:48.846 --> 01:00:51.048
So we're back
to where we started.

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:53.517
CATHERINE: I'm sorry, Father?

01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:55.986
ARTHUR: I said, so we're
back where we started, then?

01:00:56.053 --> 01:00:57.454
Is that it, you mean?

01:00:57.521 --> 01:01:00.324
Yes, it looks like it.

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:03.828
But didn't Sir Robert protest
when the First Lord refused
a trial?

01:01:03.894 --> 01:01:06.263
Oh, something
far more spectacular.

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:09.066
He'd had his feet on the
Treasury table and his
hat over his eyes

01:01:09.133 --> 01:01:11.235
during most of
the First Lord's speech.

01:01:11.301 --> 01:01:14.104
And he suddenly got up,
glared at the First Lord,

01:01:14.171 --> 01:01:17.007
threw a bundle of notes on
the floor and stalked
out of the House.

01:01:17.074 --> 01:01:18.508
Magnificent effect.

01:01:18.575 --> 01:01:20.711
Or perhaps
a display of feeling?

01:01:20.778 --> 01:01:22.612
Sir Robert, Father dear,
is not a man of feeling.

01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:26.050
I doubt any emotion at all
can stir in that dead heart.

01:01:26.116 --> 01:01:27.985
Well, he took the brief.

01:01:28.052 --> 01:01:30.454
And what have
we done for him?
First-rate publicity.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:33.057
The staunch defender
of the little man.

01:01:33.123 --> 01:01:34.358
Lucky for him.

01:01:34.424 --> 01:01:36.060
Mmm, and lucky for us, too.

01:01:36.126 --> 01:01:37.394
No, don't fool yourself.

01:01:37.461 --> 01:01:41.065
He's an avaricious,
a conniving and
unfeeling man.

01:01:41.131 --> 01:01:44.101
We've bought his services,
for the moment.

01:01:44.168 --> 01:01:46.103
We've bought him like
a cheap thrupenny whore.

01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:47.704
Sir Robert Morton.
(COUGHING)

01:01:47.772 --> 01:01:48.939
Good evening.

01:01:49.006 --> 01:01:51.275
ARTHUR: Sir Robert!
Good evening.

01:01:51.341 --> 01:01:52.910
Something gone down
the wrong way?

01:01:52.977 --> 01:01:54.078
Yes.

01:01:54.144 --> 01:01:55.345
May I assist?

01:01:55.412 --> 01:01:56.881
Most kind.

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:04.021
(CLEARS THROAT)

01:02:04.088 --> 01:02:06.023
Good evening, sir.
Sir Robert.

01:02:06.090 --> 01:02:08.392
I thought I would call
and give you an account
of the day's proceedings,

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:10.828
but perhaps your daughter
has forestalled me.

01:02:10.895 --> 01:02:12.362
Sir Robert, would you
forgive me for a moment?

01:02:12.429 --> 01:02:13.630
Catherine, I wonder if
you would be kind enough

01:02:13.697 --> 01:02:16.200
to entertain Sir Robert
in my absence.

01:02:16.266 --> 01:02:19.103
Did you know
I was in the gallery?

01:02:19.169 --> 01:02:21.671
How could I have missed you
with such a charming
brown hat?

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:23.073
Oh, thank you.

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:25.275
Will you betray a technical
secret, Sir Robert?

01:02:25.342 --> 01:02:27.311
What happened during
the first examination

01:02:27.377 --> 01:02:29.613
to make you
so sure of his innocence?

01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:32.950
Three things.

01:02:33.017 --> 01:02:36.420
First of all, he made far
too many damaging admissions.

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:40.124
A guilty person would have
been much more careful
and on his guard.

01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:41.826
Secondly I laid him a trap,

01:02:41.892 --> 01:02:44.694
and thirdly,
left him a loophole.

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:46.763
Anyone who was guilty
would have fallen
into the one

01:02:46.831 --> 01:02:48.899
and darted through
the other.

01:02:48.966 --> 01:02:50.267
He did neither.

01:02:50.334 --> 01:02:51.902
The trap was to
ask him suddenly

01:02:51.969 --> 01:02:54.538
what time Elliot
put the postal order
in his locker, wasn't it?

01:02:55.172 --> 01:02:56.573
Yes.

01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:59.209
And the loophole?

01:02:59.276 --> 01:03:05.015
I then suggested to him that
he'd stolen the postal order
for a joke,

01:03:05.082 --> 01:03:08.886
which had he been guilty,
I'm quite sure he would
have admitted to

01:03:08.953 --> 01:03:11.555
as being the lesser
of two evils.

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:14.358
CATHERINE: I see. It was
very cleverly thought out.

01:03:14.424 --> 01:03:15.459
Thank you.

01:03:15.525 --> 01:03:17.694
And what of
the 25 minutes?

01:03:17.761 --> 01:03:18.863
Twenty-five minutes?

01:03:18.929 --> 01:03:20.797
Ronnie went back
to the locker room

01:03:20.865 --> 01:03:23.067
and there were 25 minutes
there, which he could not
account for.

01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:24.568
What was he doing?

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:26.136
Hmm.

01:03:26.203 --> 01:03:28.372
But I thought
you should know.

01:03:28.438 --> 01:03:29.573
Why on earth, me?

01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:30.941
It is a crime
you indulge in.

01:03:31.008 --> 01:03:33.043
What can you mean?

01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:34.611
He was smoking a cigarette.

01:03:34.678 --> 01:03:37.647
Sir Robert!
May we offer you
some refreshment?

01:03:37.714 --> 01:03:38.949
Whiskey and soda, perhaps?

01:03:39.016 --> 01:03:40.650
A whiskey, thank you.

01:03:40.717 --> 01:03:43.954
My daughter told me of your
demonstration during the
First Lord's speech.

01:03:44.021 --> 01:03:46.223
She described
it as magnificent.

01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:47.591
Did she?
That was good of her.

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:49.526
It's a very old trick,
you know.

01:03:49.593 --> 01:03:52.396
I've done it many times
in the courts. It's nearly
always surprisingly effective.

01:03:52.462 --> 01:03:55.565
Was the First Lord at all
put out by it? Did you notice?

01:03:55.632 --> 01:03:56.833
How could he have
failed to be?

01:03:56.901 --> 01:03:58.535
I wish you could have
seen it, Father. It was...

01:03:58.602 --> 01:04:00.170
I beg your pardon, sir,
I clean forgot to give
you this letter.

01:04:00.237 --> 01:04:01.838
Thank you, Violet.

01:04:01.906 --> 01:04:03.773
When did this come?

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:04.909
A few minutes ago, miss.

01:04:04.975 --> 01:04:06.310
Thank you.

01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:14.251
You know the writing?

01:04:14.318 --> 01:04:16.286
I shouldn't bother to
read it if I were you.

01:04:20.757 --> 01:04:23.093
Would you forgive me,
Sir Robert?

01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:25.462
Of course.

01:04:25.529 --> 01:04:28.465
Well, and
what do you think
the next step should be?

01:04:28.532 --> 01:04:29.967
SIR ROBERT:
In the abstract
or the particular?

01:04:30.034 --> 01:04:31.568
CATHERINE:
The particular, please.

01:04:31.635 --> 01:04:33.537
I believe that
perhaps the best plan

01:04:33.603 --> 01:04:37.074
would be to renew our
efforts to force the Director
of Public Prosecutions to act.

01:04:37.141 --> 01:04:39.176
Don't you think that
would be rather unorthodox?

01:04:39.243 --> 01:04:40.577
Well, I certainly hope so.

01:04:40.644 --> 01:04:42.646
Do you think we have
a chance of success?

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:45.549
Of course,
or I would not suggest it.

01:04:45.615 --> 01:04:50.487
Father, Sir Robert thinks
we might get the Director
of Public Prosecutions to act.

01:04:51.821 --> 01:04:53.523
What?

01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:55.225
What did you say?

01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:59.463
We were discussing
how to proceed
with the case.

01:05:03.533 --> 01:05:06.670
I'm afraid
I don't think,
all things considered,

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:10.140
that much purpose
would be served
by going on.

01:05:10.207 --> 01:05:13.777
No, I don't think any purpose
would be served by going on.

01:05:15.379 --> 01:05:17.247
That's absurd.

01:05:17.314 --> 01:05:20.917
Of course we must go on.
How could you say otherwise?

01:05:20.985 --> 01:05:23.120
I've made sacrifices
for this case.

01:05:23.187 --> 01:05:28.692
Some of them
I had no right to make,
but I made them nonetheless.

01:05:29.393 --> 01:05:31.428
But there is a limit.

01:05:31.495 --> 01:05:32.963
And I've reached it.

01:05:37.534 --> 01:05:39.936
I'm sorry, Sir Robert.

01:05:40.004 --> 01:05:41.938
The Winslow case is
now closed.

01:05:52.882 --> 01:05:54.351
Perhaps I should
explain this letter.

01:05:54.418 --> 01:05:56.186
There is no need.

01:05:56.253 --> 01:05:57.321
This letter
is from a certain
Colonel Watherstone,

01:05:57.387 --> 01:05:59.723
who is the father of
the man I'm engaged to.

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:01.925
He writes
that our efforts to
discredit the Admiralty

01:06:01.992 --> 01:06:03.827
in the House
of Commons today

01:06:03.893 --> 01:06:05.996
have resulted merely
in our making the
name of Winslow

01:06:06.063 --> 01:06:07.998
a nationwide laughingstock.

01:06:08.065 --> 01:06:09.666
I don't care for his English.

01:06:09.733 --> 01:06:12.236
It's not very good, is it?

01:06:12.302 --> 01:06:14.971
He goes on to say
that unless my father

01:06:15.039 --> 01:06:16.373
will give him
a firm undertaking

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:18.975
to drop this whining
and reckless agitation,

01:06:19.043 --> 01:06:21.111
I suppose
he means the case,

01:06:21.178 --> 01:06:23.647
he will exert every bit
of influence he has
over his son

01:06:23.713 --> 01:06:25.582
to prevent him marrying me.

01:06:25.649 --> 01:06:27.084
I see.

01:06:30.087 --> 01:06:31.221
May I take a cigarette?

01:06:31.288 --> 01:06:32.989
Yes, of course.

01:06:33.057 --> 01:06:35.392
It's a vile habit,
isn't it?

01:06:35.459 --> 01:06:37.527
Which of us is perfect?

01:06:42.066 --> 01:06:45.769
That really was a most
charming hat, Miss Winslow.

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:47.537
I'm glad you liked it.

01:06:47.604 --> 01:06:51.441
It seems decidedly
wrong to me that a lady
of your political persuasion

01:06:51.508 --> 01:06:56.280
should be allowed
to adorn herself with such
a very feminine allurement.

01:06:58.582 --> 01:07:01.985
It really looks so awfully
like trying to have the
best of both worlds.

01:07:02.052 --> 01:07:03.120
Does it indeed?

01:07:06.656 --> 01:07:07.891
It does.

01:07:09.326 --> 01:07:12.829
And is that a particularly
female trait?

01:07:12.896 --> 01:07:14.564
I'm not a militant,
you know, Sir Robert.

01:07:14.631 --> 01:07:18.335
I don't go about shattering
glass or pouring acid down
pillar-boxes.

01:07:18.402 --> 01:07:20.304
I'm very glad to hear it.

01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:23.573
Both those activities
would be highly
unsuitable in that hat.

01:07:26.743 --> 01:07:29.279
I have never
yet fully grasped

01:07:29.346 --> 01:07:32.916
what active steps you take
to propagate your cause,
Miss Winslow.

01:07:32.982 --> 01:07:35.352
I'm an organizing secretary
at the West London branch

01:07:35.419 --> 01:07:37.354
of the Women's
Suffrage Association.

01:07:39.856 --> 01:07:41.125
Indeed?

01:07:42.526 --> 01:07:44.528
Is the work hard?

01:07:44.594 --> 01:07:46.029
Very.

01:07:46.096 --> 01:07:48.632
But not,
I should imagine,
particularly lucrative.

01:07:48.698 --> 01:07:51.034
The work is
voluntary and unpaid.

01:07:51.101 --> 01:07:53.103
Dear me.

01:07:53.170 --> 01:07:56.773
What sacrifices you
young ladies seem prepared
to make for your convictions.

01:07:59.276 --> 01:08:01.945
Forgive me, sir, if I spoke
out of turn just now.

01:08:05.215 --> 01:08:07.784
Oh, that's quite all right.

01:08:07.851 --> 01:08:11.221
Of course, you must
act as you think fit.

01:08:11.288 --> 01:08:13.390
But might I suggest that
you delay your decision

01:08:13.457 --> 01:08:15.259
until you've thought
a little while.

01:08:17.694 --> 01:08:19.496
I'll give you
my answer presently.

01:08:30.807 --> 01:08:32.642
(MAN SHOUTING ORDERS)

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:46.390
(SHOUTING ORDERS)

01:09:01.805 --> 01:09:05.542
Well, my father wrote
your father a letter.

01:09:05.609 --> 01:09:07.076
Yes.
You read it?

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:08.345
Yes, did you?

01:09:08.412 --> 01:09:11.615
He showed it to me.
Yes. What's his answer?

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:12.881
My father?
Yes.

01:09:12.948 --> 01:09:14.017
I don't suppose
he'll send one.

01:09:14.082 --> 01:09:15.185
He'll ignore it?

01:09:15.252 --> 01:09:17.453
Isn't that the best
response to blackmail?

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.523
Yes.

01:09:19.589 --> 01:09:21.258
It was rather highhanded
of the old man.

01:09:21.325 --> 01:09:23.059
Highhanded?

01:09:23.126 --> 01:09:24.194
The trouble is, he's serious.

01:09:24.261 --> 01:09:26.996
I never thought he wasn't.

01:09:27.063 --> 01:09:29.499
JOHN: He's as
serious as can be.

01:09:29.566 --> 01:09:31.100
If your father carries on
with the case,

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:32.536
he'll do everything
he threatened.

01:09:32.602 --> 01:09:34.203
Your father will
forbid the match?

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:35.339
That's right.

01:09:35.404 --> 01:09:36.973
An empty threat
then, isn't it?

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:38.774
Well, there's
always the allowance.

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:41.144
Yes, I see.
There's always the allowance.

01:09:41.211 --> 01:09:42.511
And without
the settlement,

01:09:42.578 --> 01:09:44.848
you know I can't live on
my pay. And with two of us...

01:09:44.913 --> 01:09:47.050
I've heard it
said that two can
live as cheaply as one.

01:09:47.116 --> 01:09:48.117
Don't you believe it.

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:50.386
Yes, I see.

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:58.094
You're off
to the House
of Commons again?

01:09:58.161 --> 01:10:00.964
Oh, yes, it's hard
on you, John, isn't it?

01:10:05.269 --> 01:10:08.372
A fellow thought
I'd like to see this.

01:10:08.438 --> 01:10:10.407
He cut it out to show me.

01:10:13.443 --> 01:10:15.245
Here's poor old John Bull

01:10:15.312 --> 01:10:19.115
and he can't get
his work done because
of the Winslow situation.

01:10:19.182 --> 01:10:21.184
What do you
think about that?

01:10:24.254 --> 01:10:26.323
Do you want to
marry me, John?

01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:27.424
Yes. Yes, I do.

01:10:27.491 --> 01:10:28.825
But isn't it
already too late?

01:10:28.892 --> 01:10:30.294
Even if we throw out the case,

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:32.596
would you still want to
marry the Winslow girl?

01:10:32.662 --> 01:10:34.230
All that will
blow over in time.

01:10:34.298 --> 01:10:36.232
And we'd still
have the allowance.

01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:39.403
It is important, darling.
You can't shame me into
saying that it isn't.

01:10:39.469 --> 01:10:40.804
I didn't mean to shame you.

01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:41.905
Oh, but you did.

01:10:42.906 --> 01:10:44.508
I'm sorry.

01:10:44.574 --> 01:10:46.142
The case is lost, Catherine.

01:10:46.209 --> 01:10:47.644
The case is lost. Give it up.

01:10:47.711 --> 01:10:48.945
What's your answer?

01:10:50.614 --> 01:10:53.783
I love you, John. The answer
is I want to be your wife.

01:10:54.951 --> 01:10:56.620
Well, then,
you'll drop the case?

01:10:59.289 --> 01:11:00.690
Yes, I will.

01:11:03.393 --> 01:11:04.628
I must tell Sir Robert.

01:11:08.732 --> 01:11:10.700
...histrionic hyperbole.
MEMBER: Hear, hear.

01:11:10.767 --> 01:11:14.338
It was
the Right Honorable and
learned gentleman opposite

01:11:14.404 --> 01:11:16.806
to calumny the Admiralty,

01:11:16.873 --> 01:11:19.976
for a child, gentlemen.
For a child.

01:11:20.043 --> 01:11:22.379
A guilty child.

01:11:22.446 --> 01:11:26.249
Or can we not, I do
beseech you, make an end?

01:11:27.851 --> 01:11:31.154
One cannot sue the Crown!

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:35.392
Justice has been done
to the tenth decimal point.

01:11:35.459 --> 01:11:38.962
And it is time to
lay aside nursery gossip

01:11:39.028 --> 01:11:43.400
and to proceed with
the business of government.
The business of government...

01:11:43.467 --> 01:11:45.168
You're all in, Bobby.

01:11:45.234 --> 01:11:46.235
Hmm?

01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:48.405
I say, you're all in.
Go home.

01:11:48.472 --> 01:11:49.506
We're finished, Bob.

01:11:49.573 --> 01:11:51.207
You've fought
the good fight.

01:11:51.274 --> 01:11:52.308
You've fought
the good fight,

01:11:52.376 --> 01:11:54.944
but we ain't got
the votes. It's over.

01:11:55.011 --> 01:11:56.112
MEMBER 1: Well,
we did what we could.

01:11:56.179 --> 01:11:58.515
MEMBER 2:
Thanks for your support.

01:11:58.582 --> 01:12:00.183
Don't break
your heart over it.

01:12:00.249 --> 01:12:02.318
Everybody loses one.
There's no shame in it.
MEMBER 3: Sorry, Bobby.

01:12:02.386 --> 01:12:03.420
Listen to Tony, Bob.

01:12:03.487 --> 01:12:04.988
You can't hold back
the tide.

01:12:05.054 --> 01:12:06.756
You couldn't have
fought harder.

01:12:06.823 --> 01:12:10.894
The House is against you.
Let's let it go.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:13.930
And I believe I can
state with certainty

01:12:13.997 --> 01:12:18.468
that the mood
of this House is sure,
correct and supportive

01:12:18.535 --> 01:12:22.071
of the Admiralty
on behalf of which,

01:12:22.138 --> 01:12:26.410
and on behalf of those
it is sworn to guard.

01:12:26.476 --> 01:12:28.344
I thank you for your patience.

01:12:28.412 --> 01:12:29.746
And I thank you for your time.

01:12:29.813 --> 01:12:31.314
What's this?

01:12:31.381 --> 01:12:33.149
Mr. Speaker.
Put the question.

01:12:33.216 --> 01:12:34.651
MEMBER 4: Hear, hear.
Put the question.
They're calling the question.

01:12:34.718 --> 01:12:36.886
Let them call the question.
We're done.

01:12:36.953 --> 01:12:38.422
There's no shame in it, Bob.

01:12:38.488 --> 01:12:40.256
The motion is...
Here you are.

01:12:40.323 --> 01:12:43.159
Point of order, Mr. Speaker.
Point of order.

01:12:43.226 --> 01:12:45.795
I am on my feet.
Does this escape you?

01:12:45.862 --> 01:12:47.196
Point of order, I say.

01:12:47.263 --> 01:12:49.365
I am on my feet.
MEMBER 5: The man's
on his feet.

01:12:49.433 --> 01:12:51.134
Gentlemen! There is
a motion on the floor.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:53.069
Point of order.
I must insist!
What?

01:12:53.136 --> 01:12:54.938
Upon what grounds?

01:12:55.004 --> 01:12:56.005
Well, sit down
and I'll tell you.

01:12:56.072 --> 01:12:57.306
MEMBER 6: That's right,
sit down!

01:12:57.373 --> 01:12:59.008
Very well,
make your old speech.

01:13:00.176 --> 01:13:02.245
Thank you.

01:13:02.311 --> 01:13:04.814
I have a point of order,
Mr. Speaker.

01:13:04.881 --> 01:13:07.817
I should like to
read into the record
two items. Two items.

01:13:07.884 --> 01:13:11.087
First item,
popular song of the day.

01:13:11.154 --> 01:13:14.891
How Still We See Thee Lie
or The Naughty Cadet.

01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:21.064
"How dare
you sully Nelson's name
who for this land did die?

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:24.200
"Oh, naughty cadet,
for shame, for shame.

01:13:24.267 --> 01:13:26.803
"How still we see thee lie."

01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:30.206
They suggest, they suggest
our concern for the boy

01:13:30.273 --> 01:13:33.677
might perhaps tarnish the
reputation of Lord Nelson.

01:13:33.743 --> 01:13:34.978
No, I don't think so.

01:13:35.044 --> 01:13:36.546
You said two items.

01:13:36.613 --> 01:13:38.948
The other one is this.
It's from a slightly
older source.

01:13:39.015 --> 01:13:40.316
It is this,

01:13:40.383 --> 01:13:43.119
"You shall not
side with the great
against the powerless."

01:13:43.186 --> 01:13:44.721
Mr. Speaker, point of order.

01:13:44.788 --> 01:13:46.389
I'm on my feet!
MEMBER 7: Withdraw.

01:13:46.456 --> 01:13:49.225
Will you yield?
I will not yield, Mr. Speaker.

01:13:49.292 --> 01:13:52.596
"You shall not
side with the great
against the powerless."

01:13:52.662 --> 01:13:53.897
MEMBER 8: Hear, hear.

01:13:53.963 --> 01:13:55.899
SIR ROBERT: Have you heard
those words, gentlemen?

01:13:55.965 --> 01:13:58.602
Do you recognize
their source?

01:13:58.668 --> 01:14:00.970
From that same source
I add this injunction.

01:14:01.037 --> 01:14:05.475
It is this, "What you do
to the least of them,
you do to me."

01:14:09.112 --> 01:14:10.179
Now...

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:12.716
Now, gentlemen...

01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:15.084
Good afternoon, miss.

01:14:15.151 --> 01:14:16.586
Hello.

01:14:16.653 --> 01:14:18.287
REPORTER: I'll be damned
if that's not the most...

01:14:18.354 --> 01:14:19.723
Get on the camera!
Will you get on the camera!

01:14:19.789 --> 01:14:21.124
The most astounding thing.

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:22.759
What happened?
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Let me through, please.

01:14:22.826 --> 01:14:24.494
What happened?
What happened?

01:14:24.561 --> 01:14:25.995
First Lord
thought he was safe.
Thought he was home free.

01:14:26.062 --> 01:14:27.864
Sir Robert spoke and
now he's under attack.

01:14:27.931 --> 01:14:30.199
From whom?
From whom? From everybody.

01:14:30.266 --> 01:14:31.367
When he comes out,
here's what I want.

01:14:31.434 --> 01:14:32.736
But for God's sake,
wait for the crowd
to thin.

01:14:32.802 --> 01:14:34.003
Excuse me.
Excuse me, sir.

01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:35.338
CATHERINE: Mr. Michaels.

01:14:35.404 --> 01:14:36.405
ATTENDANT: Let them out,
let them out.

01:14:36.472 --> 01:14:38.174
What happened?

01:14:38.241 --> 01:14:41.277
It seems, miss,
it seems that rather
than risk a division,

01:14:41.344 --> 01:14:42.879
the First Lord has
given an undertaking

01:14:42.946 --> 01:14:45.048
to endorse the
Petition of Right.

01:14:45.114 --> 01:14:48.151
It means that the
case of Winslow v. Rex
can therefore come to court.

01:14:48.217 --> 01:14:50.353
ATTENDANT: Let the man out.
Ah, Sir Robert.

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:58.862
Bobby.

01:14:58.928 --> 01:15:02.932
Well, Miss Winslow,
what are my instructions?

01:15:02.999 --> 01:15:05.301
Do you need my
instructions, Sir Robert?

01:15:05.368 --> 01:15:07.704
Aren't they already
on the petition?

01:15:07.771 --> 01:15:10.640
Doesn't it say,
"Let right be done"?

01:15:10.707 --> 01:15:13.409
Then we must endeavor
to see that it is.

01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:18.682
(CLATTERING)

01:15:38.267 --> 01:15:39.803
(BELL TINKLING)

01:15:47.944 --> 01:15:50.780
NEWSPAPER BOY:
The Winslow case.
I've got The Beacon.

01:15:50.847 --> 01:15:52.882
I've got the news.

01:15:52.949 --> 01:15:56.085
Read the latest about the
Winslow boy in these pages.

01:15:56.152 --> 01:15:58.154
Right here in these pages.

01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:00.824
Read it here.
MAN: Yes, please.

01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:02.792
Here it is. Thank you
very much, sir. Here.

01:16:02.859 --> 01:16:05.261
MAN: Thank you.
Latest on the Winslow boy.

01:16:05.328 --> 01:16:06.796
I've got the news.

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:12.568
You're thinner.

01:16:12.636 --> 01:16:13.837
I like your new suit.

01:16:13.903 --> 01:16:16.439
Off the peg at
three and a half guineas.

01:16:16.505 --> 01:16:18.942
I say, does that stuff
go on all the time outside?

01:16:19.008 --> 01:16:20.409
We're waiting
for the verdict.

01:16:20.476 --> 01:16:21.878
Where's Kate?

01:16:21.945 --> 01:16:24.413
Kate takes
the morning session.
I go in the afternoon.

01:16:25.081 --> 01:16:26.616
How's it all going?

01:16:28.484 --> 01:16:30.654
I don't know.

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:31.988
I've been there
all four days now

01:16:32.055 --> 01:16:34.190
and hardly
understood a word.

01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:39.128
Will there be room for me?

01:16:39.195 --> 01:16:40.296
Oh, yes.

01:16:40.363 --> 01:16:42.431
They reserve places
for the family.

01:16:42.498 --> 01:16:45.068
How'd Ronnie get on
in the witness box?

01:16:45.134 --> 01:16:48.137
Two days he was
cross-examined.
Two whole days.

01:16:48.204 --> 01:16:50.473
You imagine?
Poor little pet.

01:16:50.539 --> 01:16:52.475
I must say
he didn't seem
to mind much.

01:16:52.541 --> 01:16:54.177
He said
two days with
the Attorney General

01:16:54.243 --> 01:16:56.946
wasn't nearly as bad as
two minutes with Sir Robert.

01:16:59.816 --> 01:17:02.018
Kate said he made a very
good impression on the jury.

01:17:02.085 --> 01:17:03.219
How is Kate, Mother?

01:17:04.721 --> 01:17:06.723
All right. (SIGHS)

01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:08.124
You heard about
John, I suppose.

01:17:08.191 --> 01:17:09.926
Yes. That's what I meant.
How has she taken it?

01:17:09.993 --> 01:17:11.260
You can never
tell with Kate.

01:17:11.327 --> 01:17:13.863
She never
lets you know
what she's feeling.

01:17:13.930 --> 01:17:16.365
We all think
he behaved very badly.

01:17:17.867 --> 01:17:18.902
Your father's
on the terrace.

01:17:34.217 --> 01:17:35.819
How are you, Dickie?

01:17:35.885 --> 01:17:38.154
Very well,
thank you, Father.

01:17:38.221 --> 01:17:41.224
Mr. Lamb tells me you've
joined the Territorials.

01:17:41.290 --> 01:17:42.525
I'm sorry, Father, what?

01:17:42.992 --> 01:17:44.293
(SIGHS)

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:47.530
Mr. Lamb tells me that
you've enlisted in
the Territorials.

01:17:47.596 --> 01:17:49.265
Yes, Father.

01:17:49.332 --> 01:17:50.900
Why have you done that?

01:17:50.967 --> 01:17:53.369
Well, from all accounts
there's a fair chance
of a scrap soon.

01:17:53.436 --> 01:17:55.571
If there is,
I want to get in on it.

01:17:55.638 --> 01:17:57.673
If there is a scrap,
as you call it,

01:17:57.741 --> 01:17:59.408
you'll do far better to
stay at the bank.

01:17:59.475 --> 01:18:01.878
No, no. Too much
conflict at the bank.

01:18:01.945 --> 01:18:03.246
Is that how
it seems to you?

01:18:03.312 --> 01:18:05.514
Oh, yes.
Makes the blood run cold.

01:18:07.150 --> 01:18:08.651
How's Catherine?

01:18:08.718 --> 01:18:11.755
She's late. She was
in half-past yesterday.

01:18:11.821 --> 01:18:14.690
Well, perhaps
they're taking the
lunch interval later today.

01:18:14.758 --> 01:18:16.425
Lunch interval?

01:18:16.492 --> 01:18:17.894
This isn't
a cricket match, Grace.

01:18:19.362 --> 01:18:23.232
Nor, may I say is it
a matinee at the Gaiety.

01:18:23.299 --> 01:18:26.102
Why are you wearing that
highly unsuitable getup?

01:18:26.169 --> 01:18:29.605
Don't you like it, dear?
It's Madame DuPont's best.

01:18:29.672 --> 01:18:34.177
Grace, your son
is facing a charge
of theft and forgery.

01:18:34.243 --> 01:18:35.511
GRACE: Oh, dear,
it's so difficult.

01:18:35.578 --> 01:18:38.514
I can't wear the same
old dress day after day.

01:18:38.581 --> 01:18:40.984
It's repetitious
and depressing.

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:42.551
I'll tell you what, Arthur.

01:18:42.618 --> 01:18:46.856
I'll wear my black coat
and skirt tomorrow
for the verdict.

01:18:46.923 --> 01:18:51.160
Yes, that's what I'll do.
I'll wear it for the verdict.

01:18:51.227 --> 01:18:53.362
ARTHUR: Did you say
my lunch was ready?

01:18:53.429 --> 01:18:55.364
Yes, dear.
It's only cold.

01:18:55.431 --> 01:18:58.768
I made
the salad myself.
Violet is at the trial.

01:18:58.835 --> 01:19:02.105
Is Violet with you?
She was under sentence
the last time I saw you.

01:19:02.171 --> 01:19:04.473
Neither your father nor I
had the courage to tell her.

01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:06.409
I have the courage
to tell her.

01:19:06.475 --> 01:19:08.177
Funny that you
don't then, dear.

01:19:08.244 --> 01:19:11.881
See, Dickie, how these taunts
of cowardice are daily flung
at my head?

01:19:11.948 --> 01:19:13.082
But should
I take them up,

01:19:13.149 --> 01:19:14.483
I'm forbidden to
move in the matter.

01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:16.585
Such is the logic of women.

01:19:18.154 --> 01:19:19.688
Will you take him away
after the verdict?

01:19:24.493 --> 01:19:26.029
He's promised to go
into a nursing home.

01:19:26.095 --> 01:19:27.730
Will he?
How should I know?

01:19:27.797 --> 01:19:31.267
Surely if
he loses this time,
he's lost for good?

01:19:31.334 --> 01:19:32.501
I can only hope that
it's true.

01:19:32.568 --> 01:19:33.569
(DOOR OPENS)

01:19:33.636 --> 01:19:36.239
CATHERINE: Lord, the heat.

01:19:36.305 --> 01:19:39.342
Mother, can't you get
rid of those reporters?

01:19:39.408 --> 01:19:40.409
Hello, Dickie.

01:19:40.476 --> 01:19:41.477
Hello, Kate.

01:19:41.544 --> 01:19:42.879
Come to be in
at the death?

01:19:42.946 --> 01:19:44.047
Is that what
it's going to be?

01:19:44.113 --> 01:19:45.281
CATHERINE: Looks like it.

01:19:45.348 --> 01:19:46.615
ARTHUR:
You're late, Catherine.

01:19:46.682 --> 01:19:48.617
I know. I'm sorry, Father.

01:19:48.684 --> 01:19:50.719
There was
such a huge crowd.

01:19:50.786 --> 01:19:52.688
I have to go and change.

01:19:53.756 --> 01:19:55.358
Was it a bigger crowd
than yesterday?

01:19:55.424 --> 01:19:57.961
Oh, yes, Mother, far bigger.

01:19:58.027 --> 01:20:00.029
So how did it
go this morning?

01:20:00.096 --> 01:20:03.099
Sir Robert finished his
cross-examination of
the postmistress.

01:20:03.166 --> 01:20:05.468
I thought he'd demolished
her completely.

01:20:05.534 --> 01:20:08.804
She admitted she
couldn't identify Ronnie
in the Commander's office.

01:20:08.872 --> 01:20:11.640
She admitted
she couldn't be sure
of the time he came in.

01:20:11.707 --> 01:20:13.576
She admitted she was
called away to the telephone

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:16.279
while he was buying
his fifteen and six
postal order,

01:20:16.345 --> 01:20:19.983
and that all Osbourne cadets
looked alike to her in
their uniforms,

01:20:20.049 --> 01:20:24.553
so that it might quite easily
have been another cadet
who cashed the five shillings.

01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:26.822
It was a brilliant
cross-examination.

01:20:26.890 --> 01:20:28.925
He didn't frighten her
or bully her.

01:20:28.992 --> 01:20:32.128
He simply coaxed her
into tying herself
into knots.

01:20:32.195 --> 01:20:34.763
Then, when he'd finished,
the Attorney General
asked her again

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:37.533
whether she was absolutely
positive that the same boy

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:39.635
that bought the
fifteen and six
postal order

01:20:39.702 --> 01:20:41.737
also cashed the
five-shilling one.

01:20:41.804 --> 01:20:43.772
She said, yes,
she was quite,
quite sure

01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:46.209
because Ronnie was such
a good-looking little boy

01:20:46.275 --> 01:20:48.611
that she'd specially
noticed him.

01:20:48.677 --> 01:20:51.247
She hadn't said that in
her examination-in-chief.

01:20:51.314 --> 01:20:53.482
Ronnie, good looking?
What utter rot.

01:20:53.549 --> 01:20:55.418
Well, if she thought
he was so especially
good-looking,

01:20:55.484 --> 01:20:57.486
why couldn't
she identify him
the same evening?

01:20:57.553 --> 01:20:59.288
CATHERINE: Don't ask me.
Ask the Attorney General.

01:20:59.355 --> 01:21:01.690
I'm sure he
has a beautifully
reasonable answer.

01:21:01.757 --> 01:21:03.993
Who else gave evidence
for the other side?

01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:05.962
CATHERINE: The Commander,
the Chief Petty Officer

01:21:06.029 --> 01:21:07.730
and one of the boys
at the college.

01:21:07.796 --> 01:21:09.165
Anything very damaging?

01:21:09.232 --> 01:21:11.200
Nothing that
we didn't expect.

01:21:11.267 --> 01:21:13.336
Did you see anyone
interesting in court, dear?

01:21:13.402 --> 01:21:16.305
Yes, Mother.
John Watherstone.

01:21:16.372 --> 01:21:18.707
John? You didn't
speak to him, I hope.

01:21:18.774 --> 01:21:21.110
Yes, of course, I did.
GRACE: Kate, you didn't.

01:21:21.177 --> 01:21:22.345
What did he say?

01:21:22.411 --> 01:21:24.180
He wished us luck.

01:21:24.247 --> 01:21:25.714
What impertinence.

01:21:25.781 --> 01:21:27.984
Is that what it is?

01:21:28.051 --> 01:21:30.853
I wonder if Violet
remembered to get
those onions.

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:33.489
I better get them myself
on the way back from court.

01:21:33.556 --> 01:21:35.224
Yes, get them
on the way back.

01:21:36.926 --> 01:21:38.928
I'm so sorry, dear.

01:21:38.995 --> 01:21:40.096
What for, Mother?

01:21:40.163 --> 01:21:42.665
John, being such a bad hat.

01:21:44.233 --> 01:21:46.169
I never did like him
very much, you know.

01:21:46.235 --> 01:21:47.603
No. I know.

01:21:54.543 --> 01:21:55.744
(SIGHS)

01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:06.222
You're looking well, Dickie.

01:22:06.289 --> 01:22:07.590
A trifle thinner, perhaps.

01:22:07.656 --> 01:22:08.724
Hard work, Father.

01:22:08.791 --> 01:22:09.792
Or late hours?

01:22:09.858 --> 01:22:11.327
You can't keep
late hours in Reading.

01:22:11.394 --> 01:22:14.563
Oh! You could keep
late hours anywhere.

01:22:14.630 --> 01:22:18.301
I had quite a good report
about you from Mr. Lamb
at the bank.

01:22:18.367 --> 01:22:19.668
DICKIE: Good old Mr. Lamb.

01:22:19.735 --> 01:22:22.438
I took him racing
last Saturday.

01:22:22.505 --> 01:22:25.308
(INHALES) Had the time of
his life and lost his shirt.

01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:29.112
Did he? Did he indeed?

01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:34.450
Now, Dickie,
when we get to
the front door,

01:22:34.517 --> 01:22:37.520
put your head down,
like me and charge
through them all.

01:22:37.586 --> 01:22:39.588
Why don't you just
go through the garden?

01:22:39.655 --> 01:22:43.026
I can't risk this hat
going through the roses.

01:22:43.092 --> 01:22:46.295
I always say,
"I'm the maid and
I don't know nothing."

01:22:46.362 --> 01:22:48.631
So don't be surprised.

01:22:48.697 --> 01:22:50.366
Right-o, Mother.

01:22:50.433 --> 01:22:51.767
(CHUCKLES)

01:23:14.323 --> 01:23:16.392
Are we going to
lose this case, Kate?

01:23:21.764 --> 01:23:23.599
How's Sir Robert?

01:23:23.666 --> 01:23:25.168
The papers said
that he began today

01:23:25.234 --> 01:23:27.103
by telling the judge
he felt ill

01:23:27.170 --> 01:23:29.405
and might have to
ask for an adjournment.
I trust he won't collapse.

01:23:29.472 --> 01:23:30.706
He won't.

01:23:30.773 --> 01:23:32.708
It was just another
of those brilliant
tricks of his

01:23:32.775 --> 01:23:34.310
he's always
boasting about.

01:23:34.377 --> 01:23:37.746
It got him the sympathy
of the court and possibly...

01:23:37.813 --> 01:23:39.615
No, I won't say that.

01:23:40.383 --> 01:23:42.685
Say it.

01:23:42.751 --> 01:23:46.155
Possibly provided him
with an excuse if
he's beaten.

01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:48.757
I see.

01:23:49.592 --> 01:23:51.460
(KNOCK ON WINDOW)

01:23:51.527 --> 01:23:52.661
ARTHUR: Desmond.

01:23:55.098 --> 01:23:56.732
Come in, Desmond.

01:23:59.402 --> 01:24:03.206
I trust you do not
object to me employing
this rather furtive entry,

01:24:03.272 --> 01:24:05.374
but the crowds
at the front door
are most alarming.

01:24:05.441 --> 01:24:06.475
Most alarming.

01:24:06.542 --> 01:24:07.776
Why have you
left the court?

01:24:07.843 --> 01:24:09.445
My partner will
be holding the fort.

01:24:09.512 --> 01:24:11.347
He is perfectly competent.
I promise you.

01:24:11.414 --> 01:24:13.048
I'm glad to hear it.

01:24:14.483 --> 01:24:17.253
I wondered if I might
see Catherine alone.

01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:20.389
I have a matter
of some urgency to
communicate to her.

01:24:20.456 --> 01:24:24.627
Ah. Do you wish to hear
this urgent matter, Kate?

01:24:24.693 --> 01:24:26.229
Yes, Father.

01:24:26.295 --> 01:24:27.396
Well.

01:24:29.365 --> 01:24:30.733
Forgive me.

01:24:35.638 --> 01:24:40.109
I have to be
back in court. I...

01:24:40.176 --> 01:24:42.911
Perhaps you would
give me a moment
of your time.

01:24:42.978 --> 01:24:44.947
Yes, of course, Desmond.

01:24:52.721 --> 01:24:54.457
It occurred to me
during the lunch recess

01:24:54.523 --> 01:24:57.059
that I had far better
see you today.

01:24:57.126 --> 01:24:58.461
Yes.

01:24:58.527 --> 01:25:00.896
I have a question
to put to you, Kate,

01:25:00.963 --> 01:25:02.798
which if I had
postponed putting
until after the verdict,

01:25:02.865 --> 01:25:06.202
you might, who knows,
have thought had been
prompted by pity

01:25:06.269 --> 01:25:08.271
if we'd lost or,
or if we'd won,

01:25:08.337 --> 01:25:10.139
your reply might,
again who knows,

01:25:10.206 --> 01:25:12.841
have been influenced
by gratitude.

01:25:12.908 --> 01:25:15.311
And that, of course,
wouldn't do.

01:25:15.378 --> 01:25:16.979
Do you follow me, Kate?

01:25:17.045 --> 01:25:19.248
Yes, Desmond.
I think I do.

01:25:19.315 --> 01:25:22.485
Ah. Then perhaps
you have some inkling

01:25:22.551 --> 01:25:24.953
of what the question is
I have to put to you?

01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:26.455
Yes, I think I have.

01:25:26.522 --> 01:25:27.523
Oh.

01:25:29.758 --> 01:25:31.827
I'm sorry, Desmond.
I ought, I know,

01:25:31.894 --> 01:25:34.029
to have followed the
usual practice in
such cases,

01:25:34.096 --> 01:25:35.731
and told you I had
no inkling whatever.

01:25:35.798 --> 01:25:37.566
No, no. Your directness
and honesty

01:25:37.633 --> 01:25:40.169
are two of the qualities
I so much admire in you.

01:25:40.236 --> 01:25:41.370
I'm glad that
you have guessed.

01:25:41.437 --> 01:25:44.006
It makes my task
the easier.

01:25:44.072 --> 01:25:47.142
The facts are these that
you don't love me
and never can,

01:25:47.210 --> 01:25:52.948
and that I love you,
always have and
always will.

01:25:53.015 --> 01:25:55.418
It is a situation which,
after most careful
consideration,

01:25:55.484 --> 01:25:57.486
I am fully prepared
to accept.

01:25:57.553 --> 01:25:59.655
I reached
this decision
some months ago,

01:25:59.722 --> 01:26:02.491
but I thought at first
it might be better to
wait until this case

01:26:02.558 --> 01:26:06.028
which is so much
on all our minds,
should be over.

01:26:06.094 --> 01:26:07.296
Then at lunch today,

01:26:07.363 --> 01:26:11.099
I determined to anticipate
the verdict tomorrow.

01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:13.669
I see. Thank you
so much, Desmond.

01:26:13.736 --> 01:26:15.738
That makes everything
much clearer.

01:26:15.804 --> 01:26:19.508
There is much more
that I meant to say,

01:26:21.477 --> 01:26:23.312
but I shall put it
in a letter.

01:26:23.379 --> 01:26:25.013
Yes, Desmond. Do.

01:26:27.082 --> 01:26:28.984
Will you give me a few days
to think it over?

01:26:29.051 --> 01:26:31.153
Of course. Of course.

01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:33.389
I need hardly tell you
how grateful I am.

01:26:33.456 --> 01:26:36.091
There is no need,
Kate. No need at all.

01:26:40.796 --> 01:26:42.197
You mustn't keep
your taxi waiting.

01:26:42.265 --> 01:26:44.166
Yes. (CLEARS THROAT)

01:26:45.301 --> 01:26:46.402
Well.

01:26:48.304 --> 01:26:50.773
Then I may expect
your answer in a few days.

01:26:50.839 --> 01:26:52.975
Yes, Desmond.

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:55.043
I must get back to court.

01:26:56.712 --> 01:26:58.314
Hmm. Well,

01:27:00.849 --> 01:27:02.485
how do you think
it went this morning?

01:27:02.551 --> 01:27:05.020
I thought the postmistress
restored the Admiralty's case

01:27:05.087 --> 01:27:06.455
with that point
about Ronnie's looks.

01:27:06.522 --> 01:27:08.223
Oh, no. No, no.
Not at all.

01:27:08.291 --> 01:27:09.858
There is still
the overwhelming fact

01:27:09.925 --> 01:27:12.160
that she couldn't
identify him.

01:27:13.662 --> 01:27:15.298
What a brilliant
cross-examination,
was it not?

01:27:15.364 --> 01:27:16.399
Brilliant.

01:27:16.465 --> 01:27:18.534
Strange man, Sir Robert.

01:27:18.601 --> 01:27:20.936
At times so cold
and distant and...

01:27:21.003 --> 01:27:23.205
CATHERINE: Passionless.

01:27:23.272 --> 01:27:26.309
And yet, he has a real
passion about this case.

01:27:26.375 --> 01:27:28.076
Does he?
Yes, I happen to know,

01:27:28.143 --> 01:27:30.613
and of course this must on
no account go any further,

01:27:30.679 --> 01:27:31.747
but I happen to know
that he has made

01:27:31.814 --> 01:27:33.916
a very, very great
personal sacrifice

01:27:33.982 --> 01:27:35.017
in order to
bring it to court.

01:27:35.083 --> 01:27:36.785
Sacrifice? What,
of another brief?

01:27:36.852 --> 01:27:39.355
No, no, no. That is
no sacrifice to him. No.

01:27:39.422 --> 01:27:43.726
He was offered...
You really promise to
keep this to yourself?

01:27:43.792 --> 01:27:45.861
My dear Desmond, whatever
the government offered him

01:27:45.928 --> 01:27:47.396
can't be as startling
as all that.

01:27:47.463 --> 01:27:49.064
He's in the opposition.

01:27:49.131 --> 01:27:53.736
Indeed. Therefore, a most,
a most gracious compliment.

01:27:53.802 --> 01:27:55.571
And what position
was he offered?

01:27:57.072 --> 01:27:58.474
(WHISPERING)

01:28:00.108 --> 01:28:02.110
Yes, that's right.

01:28:02.177 --> 01:28:03.446
That's right.

01:28:03.512 --> 01:28:05.481
And he turned it down,

01:28:05.548 --> 01:28:08.651
simply in order to carry
on with the case of
Winslow v. Rex.

01:28:08.717 --> 01:28:11.320
Strange are the ways
of men, are they not?

01:28:11.387 --> 01:28:13.021
Goodbye, my dear.

01:28:32.641 --> 01:28:34.443
Father, I've been a fool.

01:28:34.510 --> 01:28:35.811
Have you, my dear?

01:28:35.878 --> 01:28:37.546
An utter fool.

01:28:38.947 --> 01:28:40.549
In default of
further information,

01:28:40.616 --> 01:28:43.952
I can only repeat,
"Have you, my dear?"

01:28:44.019 --> 01:28:47.990
There can be
no further information.
I'm under a pledge of secrecy.

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:53.328
What did Desmond want?

01:28:54.363 --> 01:28:56.799
To marry me.

01:28:56.865 --> 01:28:58.767
Well, I trust
that the folly
you were referring to

01:28:58.834 --> 01:29:00.636
wasn't your
acceptance of him.

01:29:00.703 --> 01:29:02.371
Would it be
such folly, though?

01:29:03.138 --> 01:29:04.507
Lunacy.

01:29:04.573 --> 01:29:05.874
I'm nearly 30, you know.

01:29:05.941 --> 01:29:07.309
Thirty isn't the end of life.

01:29:07.376 --> 01:29:09.044
Is that so?

01:29:09.111 --> 01:29:12.815
Better far to
live and die an old maid
than to be married to Desmond.

01:29:12.881 --> 01:29:15.317
Even an old maid must eat.

01:29:17.986 --> 01:29:19.287
Did you take
my suggestion

01:29:19.354 --> 01:29:21.289
with regard to your
Suffrage Association?

01:29:21.356 --> 01:29:23.526
Yes, Father.
You demanded a salary?

01:29:23.592 --> 01:29:24.993
I asked for one.

01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:26.995
And they're going to
give it to you, I trust?

01:29:27.062 --> 01:29:28.397
£2 a week.

01:29:28.931 --> 01:29:30.098
(SIGHS)

01:29:30.165 --> 01:29:33.502
No, Father,
the choice is quite simple.

01:29:33.569 --> 01:29:36.672
Either I marry Desmond and
settle down into quite
a comfortable

01:29:36.739 --> 01:29:39.041
and not really
useless existence,

01:29:39.107 --> 01:29:40.476
or I go on for
the rest of my life

01:29:40.543 --> 01:29:42.445
in the service of
a hopeless cause.

01:29:43.979 --> 01:29:45.981
(SIGHS) A hopeless cause.

01:29:47.450 --> 01:29:49.818
I've never heard you
say that before.

01:29:49.885 --> 01:29:51.920
I've never felt it before.

01:30:08.504 --> 01:30:11.540
John's getting
married next month.

01:30:11.607 --> 01:30:13.909
Ah, yes.
I see, I see.

01:30:15.310 --> 01:30:16.945
Did he tell you?

01:30:17.012 --> 01:30:18.714
Yes. He was
very apologetic.

01:30:18.781 --> 01:30:20.248
Apologetic?

01:30:20.315 --> 01:30:22.618
It's a girl
I know slightly.

01:30:22.685 --> 01:30:24.386
She'll make him
a good wife.

01:30:24.453 --> 01:30:26.321
Is he in love with her?

01:30:26.855 --> 01:30:28.591
Mmm-mmm.

01:30:28.657 --> 01:30:29.925
No more than
he was with me.

01:30:29.992 --> 01:30:31.727
Perhaps even
a little less.

01:30:31.794 --> 01:30:33.228
Why is he marrying her
so soon...

01:30:33.295 --> 01:30:34.630
After jilting me?

01:30:34.697 --> 01:30:36.198
Because he thinks
there's going to
be a war soon

01:30:36.264 --> 01:30:38.534
and if there is,
his regiment will
be among the first

01:30:38.601 --> 01:30:41.203
to go overseas.

01:30:41.269 --> 01:30:44.473
She's a general's daughter.
Very, very suitable.

01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:47.710
Oh, Kate, I'm so sorry.

01:30:49.144 --> 01:30:51.446
If you could go back,
Father, and choose again,

01:30:51.514 --> 01:30:53.148
would your choice
be different?

01:30:55.551 --> 01:30:56.985
Perhaps.

01:30:57.052 --> 01:30:58.687
I don't think so.

01:31:00.322 --> 01:31:02.858
I don't think so, either.

01:31:02.925 --> 01:31:06.762
I still say we both
knew what we were doing
and we were right to do it.

01:31:08.597 --> 01:31:10.566
You're not gonna
marry Desmond,
are you?

01:31:10.633 --> 01:31:13.969
In the words
of the prime minister,
Father, "Wait and see."

01:31:14.036 --> 01:31:15.137
(CHUCKLES)

01:31:15.203 --> 01:31:17.105
NEWSPAPER BOY:
Winslow case result!

01:31:17.172 --> 01:31:18.173
Find out about
the Winslow case!

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:19.575
What's that boy shouting?

01:31:19.642 --> 01:31:21.744
Only, "Winslow case latest."

01:31:21.810 --> 01:31:22.845
Winslow case result!

01:31:22.911 --> 01:31:24.379
It doesn't sound
to me like latest.

01:31:24.446 --> 01:31:26.114
Did they win
or did they lose?

01:31:26.181 --> 01:31:28.383
I've got the
Winslow case result!

01:31:28.450 --> 01:31:29.585
Result?

01:31:29.652 --> 01:31:32.254
In these pages!
Winslow case result!

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:35.157
No. There must
be some mistake.

VIOLET: Oh, sir.

01:31:44.366 --> 01:31:46.368
Oh, sir.

01:31:46.434 --> 01:31:48.270
Yes, Violet, what is it?

01:31:48.336 --> 01:31:49.672
Miss Kate.

01:31:51.740 --> 01:31:53.075
Miss Kate.

01:31:55.077 --> 01:31:57.212
I don't know
how to tell you.

01:31:58.647 --> 01:32:01.316
Just after they
come back from lunch,

01:32:01.383 --> 01:32:04.386
Mrs. Winslow,
she weren't there
neither nor Master Ronnie.

01:32:04.452 --> 01:32:06.188
The shouting,
the carrying on,

01:32:06.254 --> 01:32:08.190
you never heard
anything like it
in all your life

01:32:08.256 --> 01:32:11.694
and Sir Robert standing there
at the table with his wig
on crooked,

01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:13.629
tears running
down his face.

01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:18.000
Running down his face,
they were!

01:32:18.066 --> 01:32:21.003
Cook and me, we did
a bit of crying, too.

01:32:21.069 --> 01:32:24.573
Everyone was cheering.
Judge kept shouting.
It wasn't any good.

01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:26.474
Even the jury joined in.

01:32:26.541 --> 01:32:30.078
Some of them
climbed out of the box to
shake hands with Sir Robert.

01:32:30.145 --> 01:32:31.513
Outside in the street,
it was just the same.

01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:33.215
Couldn't move for the crowd.

01:32:33.281 --> 01:32:35.684
Think they'd all gone mad
the way they was carryin' on.

01:32:35.751 --> 01:32:37.920
Some shouting,
"Good old Winslow,"

01:32:37.986 --> 01:32:40.055
some singing, "For
he's a jolly good fellow."

01:32:40.122 --> 01:32:42.625
Cook had her hat
knocked off again.
She did.

01:32:42.691 --> 01:32:46.294
Sure as
I'm standin'
here to tell you.

01:32:46.361 --> 01:32:50.165
Well, sir, you must be
feeling nice and pleased,

01:32:50.232 --> 01:32:51.499
now it's all over.

01:32:53.135 --> 01:32:56.705
Yes, Violet. I am.

01:32:56.772 --> 01:32:59.708
Always said it
would come out all right
in the end, didn't I?

01:32:59.775 --> 01:33:00.843
Yes.

01:33:02.645 --> 01:33:04.112
Yes, you did.

01:33:08.550 --> 01:33:09.918
Yes, I did.

01:33:15.357 --> 01:33:17.760
Well, I don't mind
telling you, sir.

01:33:17.826 --> 01:33:19.261
I wondered sometimes
if you and Miss Kate

01:33:19.327 --> 01:33:20.495
weren't just
wasting your time

01:33:20.562 --> 01:33:22.164
carrying on the way
you have been.

01:33:22.230 --> 01:33:25.533
Still, couldn't
have felt that if
you'd been in court today.

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:28.336
Oh, sir, Mrs. Winslow
asked me to remember
most particular

01:33:28.403 --> 01:33:29.905
to pick up some onions
from the greengrocer, but...

01:33:29.972 --> 01:33:31.106
Oh, that's
all right, Violet.

01:33:31.173 --> 01:33:32.641
I believe
Mrs. Winslow's
picking them up herself.

01:33:32.708 --> 01:33:35.043
Oh, jolly good, miss.
Oh, poor madam.

01:33:35.110 --> 01:33:38.146
What a sell for her
when she gets to court
and finds it's all over.

01:33:38.213 --> 01:33:40.148
Well, congratulations,
I'm sure, sir.

01:33:40.215 --> 01:33:41.884
Thank you, Violet.

01:33:49.124 --> 01:33:52.360
It would appear then
that we've won.

01:33:52.427 --> 01:33:55.263
Yes, Father,
it would appear
that we've won.

01:33:59.735 --> 01:34:01.804
I would have liked
to have been there.

01:34:01.870 --> 01:34:03.772
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

01:34:04.439 --> 01:34:06.108
Sir Robert Morton.

01:34:07.309 --> 01:34:10.312
Good afternoon.

01:34:10.378 --> 01:34:13.215
I thought
you might like to
hear the actual terms

01:34:13.281 --> 01:34:16.618
of the Attorney
General's statement,

01:34:16.685 --> 01:34:18.887
so I jotted them
down for you.

01:34:20.455 --> 01:34:23.091
"On behalf
of the Admiralty,"
etcetera, etcetera,

01:34:23.158 --> 01:34:26.361
"the cadet
Ronald Arthur Winslow

name on the postal order.

"He did not take it.
He did not cash it.

01:34:34.636 --> 01:34:38.273
"That he is consequently
innocent of the charge.

01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:40.242
"That this is
a full, unreserved

01:34:40.308 --> 01:34:43.178
"and a complete acceptance
of his statements."

01:34:43.245 --> 01:34:45.147
Thank you, Sir Robert.

01:34:45.213 --> 01:34:49.985
It's hard for me
to find the words
with which to thank you.

01:34:50.052 --> 01:34:51.887
Pray do not
trouble yourself to
search for them, sir,

01:34:51.954 --> 01:34:55.323
and let us take
these rather conventional
expressions of gratitude

01:34:55.390 --> 01:34:56.558
for granted, shall we?

01:35:04.566 --> 01:35:07.302
Pity you were not
in court, Miss Winslow.

01:35:07.369 --> 01:35:09.571
The verdict appeared
to cause quite a stir.

01:35:09.637 --> 01:35:11.206
So I heard.

01:35:11.273 --> 01:35:12.975
Why did
the Admiralty
resign the case?

01:35:13.041 --> 01:35:15.177
Oh, it was
a foregone conclusion.

01:35:15.243 --> 01:35:16.578
Oh?

01:35:16.644 --> 01:35:18.346
Once the
handwriting expert
had been discredited,

01:35:18.413 --> 01:35:20.315
not for the first time
in legal history,

01:35:20.382 --> 01:35:21.716
I knew we had
a sporting chance.

01:35:21.784 --> 01:35:24.619
But this morning,
you seemed so depressed.

01:35:24.686 --> 01:35:26.755
Did I?

01:35:26.822 --> 01:35:29.958

in the courtroom.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

01:35:32.527 --> 01:35:34.229
Oh, sir.

01:35:34.296 --> 01:35:36.832
The gentlemen at the
front door say, please,
will you make a statement.

01:35:36.899 --> 01:35:38.333
They say they won't
go away unless you do.

01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:40.135

Violet. Thank you.

01:35:40.202 --> 01:35:41.269
Sir.

01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:43.538
Hmm.

01:35:44.406 --> 01:35:45.908
What shall I say to them?

01:35:46.975 --> 01:35:49.845
I hardly think
it matters, sir.

01:35:49.912 --> 01:35:53.115
Whatever you say will have
little bearing on what
they write.

01:35:53.181 --> 01:35:58.887
I could say,
"This victory isn't mine,
it belongs to the people."

01:35:58.954 --> 01:36:01.924
How does that strike you, sir?
A trifle pretentious, perhaps?

01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:03.792
Perhaps, sir.
Hmm.

01:36:03.859 --> 01:36:07.229
I should
say it nonetheless.
It will be very popular.

01:36:07.295 --> 01:36:11.133
Perhaps I should just say,
"Thank God we beat 'em."

01:36:16.438 --> 01:36:18.373
SIR ROBERT: Miss Winslow,

01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:21.576
might I be rude enough to ask
you for a glass of your
excellent whiskey?

01:36:21.643 --> 01:36:22.677
Yes, of course.

01:36:22.744 --> 01:36:23.812
Very kind.

01:36:23.879 --> 01:36:26.081
I beg your pardon.

01:36:26.148 --> 01:36:28.884
How remiss of me
not to offer you
any hospitality.

01:36:30.218 --> 01:36:32.187
I'll correct
that straightaway.

01:36:32.254 --> 01:36:34.823
What must you think of me?

01:36:34.890 --> 01:36:37.159
Perhaps you
would forgive me
in not getting up?

01:36:37.225 --> 01:36:40.628
The heat
in that courtroom
was really so infernal.

01:36:40.695 --> 01:36:42.530
Are you all right,
Sir Robert?

01:36:42.597 --> 01:36:45.467
Oh, it's just
a slight nervous
reaction, that's all.

01:36:45.533 --> 01:36:49.037
Besides, I've not been
feeling myself all day.

01:36:49.104 --> 01:36:51.806
I told the judge so this
morning, if you remember.

He thought it was a trick.

people have, have they not?

I'm afraid
I have a confession

01:37:12.394 --> 01:37:16.231
and an apology to
make to you, Sir Robert.

01:37:16.298 --> 01:37:18.934
Dear lady, I'm sure the one
is rash and the other
is superfluous.

01:37:19.001 --> 01:37:20.869
I far rather hear neither.

01:37:20.936 --> 01:37:22.704
I'm afraid you must.

01:37:24.072 --> 01:37:25.941
This is probably the
last time I shall see you,

01:37:26.008 --> 01:37:29.844
and it is a better penance
for me to say this than
to write it.

01:37:29.912 --> 01:37:33.081
I have entirely misjudged
your attitude to this case,

01:37:33.148 --> 01:37:37.352
and if in doing so
I have ever seemed to you
either rude or ungrateful,

01:37:37.419 --> 01:37:40.688
I am sincerely
and humbly sorry.

01:37:40.755 --> 01:37:44.359
My dear Miss Winslow,
you have never seemed to
me either rude or ungrateful.

01:37:44.426 --> 01:37:47.195
And my attitude to this case
has been the same as yours,

01:37:47.262 --> 01:37:50.298
a determination to win,
at all costs.

01:37:51.333 --> 01:37:53.201
Only, when you
talk of gratitude,

01:37:53.268 --> 01:37:56.972
you must remember that those
costs were not mine,
but yours.

01:38:00.808 --> 01:38:03.311
Weren't they also
yours, Sir Robert?

01:38:07.049 --> 01:38:08.883
I beg your pardon?

01:38:08.951 --> 01:38:11.753
Haven't you too made
a certain sacrifice
for the case?

01:38:13.188 --> 01:38:16.158
The robes of that office
would not have suited me.

01:38:16.224 --> 01:38:17.892

never to divulge it

to forget it yourself.

that made you weep today

had been done.

01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:10.038
Right.

01:40:10.105 --> 01:40:13.608
Easy to do justice.
Very hard to do right.

01:40:17.845 --> 01:40:20.948
Well, now, I must
leave the witness box.

01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:29.124
Miss Winslow, I hope
I shall see you again.

01:40:29.191 --> 01:40:32.260
One day perhaps in the
House of Commons, up
in the gallery.

01:40:32.327 --> 01:40:34.796
Yes, Sir Robert.
In the House of
Commons one day,

01:40:34.862 --> 01:40:36.464
but not up in the gallery.

01:40:36.531 --> 01:40:38.566
Across the floor, one day.

01:40:40.535 --> 01:40:43.271
You still pursue
your feminist activities.

01:40:43.338 --> 01:40:44.572
Oh, yes.

01:40:45.307 --> 01:40:46.408
Pity.

01:40:48.143 --> 01:40:49.811
It's a lost cause.

01:40:51.379 --> 01:40:53.681
Oh, do you really
think so, Sir Robert?

01:40:53.748 --> 01:40:56.084
How little you know
about women.

01:40:56.151 --> 01:40:59.254
Goodbye. I doubt
that we shall meet again.

01:40:59.321 --> 01:41:00.988
Oh, do you really
think so, Miss Winslow?

01:41:02.657 --> 01:41:04.592
How little
you know about men.
