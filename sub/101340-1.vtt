Our little winner.

01:58.644 --> 02:02.144
Hello,
Mr Muir. Good to meet you.

02:02.244 --> 02:04.244
This is Traci, my daughter.

02:05.164 --> 02:08.304
Alright. Well, let's
get started, shall we?

02:08.404 --> 02:09.583
Ah, sweetheart,

02:09.683 --> 02:11.703
look after little... little
Traci for me, will you?

02:11.803 --> 02:13.943
I'll be back soon, OK?

02:14.043 --> 02:16.343
Can I get you a cocktail?

02:16.443 --> 02:18.983
Thank you, but I don't drink.

02:19.083 --> 02:21.103
Is that a religious thing
or a diet?

02:21.203 --> 02:23.743
I know how you ladies
like to look your best.

02:23.843 --> 02:25.583
Come on, sit down.

02:25.683 --> 02:26.863
Thank you.

02:26.963 --> 02:29.983
So you really flew
all the way from Australia

02:30.083 --> 02:32.263
all by yourself,
no husband?

02:32.363 --> 02:34.223
No, not anymore.

02:34.323 --> 02:38.423
What did he do, did he
forget your birthday?

02:41.203 --> 02:44.023
I have always wanted
to come to America.

02:44.123 --> 02:46.583
My parents are performers
back in Australia.

02:46.683 --> 02:47.903
Is that so?

02:48.003 --> 02:50.343
I believe if you want to
make it as a singer,

02:50.443 --> 02:51.943
America is where you need
to be.

02:52.043 --> 02:54.943
Oh, it's the only place to be,
sweetheart.

02:55.043 --> 02:56.303
And, of course,

02:56.403 --> 02:59.983
the opportunity to record
an album with Mercury.

03:00.083 --> 03:01.223
That. OK, yep.

03:01.323 --> 03:03.903
So, there's not going to be
an album.

03:04.003 --> 03:04.943
What?

03:05.043 --> 03:06.943
Well, there wasn't
a recording contract.

03:07.043 --> 03:08.903
You won an audition
for the recording contract.

03:09.003 --> 03:11.983
I have to audition?

03:12.083 --> 03:14.663
OK, so when do I audition?

03:14.763 --> 03:17.542
No, no, no. You already did.
Bandstand sent us your tape.

03:17.642 --> 03:20.662
Miss Reddy, you sing,
you sing very nicely, OK,

03:20.762 --> 03:22.902
but male groups are
all the rage right now.

03:23.002 --> 03:25.222
You've heard of the Beatles,
right?

03:25.322 --> 03:26.782
See, we couldn't get you
airplay.

03:26.882 --> 03:28.382
All the radio stations
already have

03:28.482 --> 03:30.782
an allotted spot on their
playlist for the female record

03:30.882 --> 03:34.282
so I can't do anything
with a female singer.

03:50.082 --> 03:53.022
♪ I will follow him

03:53.122 --> 03:58.262
♪ Follow him wherever he may go

03:58.362 --> 04:02.222
♪ There isn't
an ocean too deep

04:02.322 --> 04:07.922
♪ A mountain so high

04:09.162 --> 04:12.862
♪ Away from my love

♪ I'll love him
I'll love him... ♪

04:42.921 --> 04:44.921
Yeah, you want something?

04:45.681 --> 04:47.621
I'm being paid less than
the band.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.741
So they're men.
They got families to feed.

04:49.841 --> 04:51.701
Well, I've got a family
to feed.

04:51.801 --> 04:54.061
Look, lady, I'm helping you out

04:54.161 --> 04:57.301
by turning a blind eye to the
fact you ain't even legal here.

04:57.401 --> 04:59.301
You want to complain
about equal pay?

04:59.401 --> 05:00.661
Find another gig

05:00.761 --> 05:03.401
or take it up with the nice
folks down at immigration.

05:14.641 --> 05:16.421
Mummy!

05:16.521 --> 05:18.521
Hi, darling.

05:20.441 --> 05:22.741
Thanks for looking after Traci.

05:22.841 --> 05:24.581
I'll try and help out
when I can.

05:24.681 --> 05:26.681
Thanks.

06:40.920 --> 06:42.919
Taxi!

06:55.999 --> 06:58.539
Excuse me, I'm looking for
Lillian Roxon.

06:58.639 --> 07:00.639
Yeah, yeah, she's over there.

07:07.239 --> 07:09.239
Um, Lillian?

07:09.999 --> 07:11.579
Hello, darling.

07:11.679 --> 07:15.499
Oh, welcome, welcome!
Where are you staying?

07:15.599 --> 07:16.699
Hotel Albert.

07:16.799 --> 07:19.619
Oh, you poor thing! It's
a terrible dump, isn't it?

07:19.719 --> 07:22.499
The worst.
But the price is right.

07:22.599 --> 07:24.779
Well, I hear the Easybeats
are headed to town soon

07:24.879 --> 07:26.739
so you might be
in good company.

07:26.839 --> 07:30.859
Well, I'm sure they'll be
welcomed with open arms.

07:30.959 --> 07:32.859
The record company
I was meant to sign with

07:32.959 --> 07:34.899
backed out of the deal.

07:34.999 --> 07:36.819
Male groups are all the rage
now.

07:36.919 --> 07:38.859
Darling, how ludicrous!

07:38.959 --> 07:41.139
Do they honestly think
all people want to hear

07:41.239 --> 07:43.379
are rip-offs of the Beatles
ad nauseum?

07:43.479 --> 07:45.699
I mean, boy guitarists
notwithstanding,

07:45.799 --> 07:47.259
I don't think I can stand
the sight

07:47.359 --> 07:50.099
of another bloody
electric guitar.

07:50.199 --> 07:52.578
Maybe there's a story in that.

07:52.678 --> 07:54.538
So you write about music too?

07:54.638 --> 07:55.778
I mean, when I can

07:55.878 --> 07:59.178
but it's mostly housekeeping,
beauty tips, fashion.

07:59.278 --> 08:01.758
But it's really music
that's changing everything.

08:04.838 --> 08:05.978
It drives me crazy

08:06.078 --> 08:08.738
'cause those blokes don't even
take rock and roll seriously.

08:08.838 --> 08:10.818
I mean, they don't get
it's a call to arms,

08:10.918 --> 08:13.218
that it connects with us
and speaks to us

08:13.318 --> 08:15.258
in a way that music
has never done before.

08:15.358 --> 08:17.618
So they can laugh
all they want.

08:17.718 --> 08:20.578
Meanwhile, I'm going to be
the one to write about it.

08:20.678 --> 08:23.618
I'm going to be front
and centre of the revolution.

08:23.718 --> 08:25.018
Then they can write about you.

08:25.118 --> 08:26.378
Yes!

08:26.478 --> 08:27.858
What about you, Helen?

08:27.958 --> 08:29.898
Do you write songs?

08:29.998 --> 08:33.178
- I'd like to do more writing.
- Well, you should.

08:33.278 --> 08:35.258
I bet you've got plenty to say.

08:35.358 --> 08:37.578
Now, have you been
to Max's yet?

08:37.678 --> 08:39.678
Max's? Who's Max?

08:40.438 --> 08:41.978
Oh, darling!

08:42.078 --> 08:44.858
It's time we welcomed you
to New York properly.

08:52.158 --> 08:53.658
Ooh, so what about him?

08:53.758 --> 08:55.658
We're just talking sex, right?

08:55.758 --> 08:58.858
Oh, God, yes! I can't abide
this whole dating culture

08:58.958 --> 09:00.937
the Americans
are obsessed with.

09:01.037 --> 09:04.497
They're so bloody timid
when it comes to sex.

09:04.597 --> 09:08.137
He looks like an actor.
No actors, that's my rule.

09:08.237 --> 09:10.377
Musicians are out too.

09:10.477 --> 09:12.137
God, who does that leave?

09:12.237 --> 09:16.097
OK, wait, I'll just check
the list.

09:16.197 --> 09:22.057
OK. We've got musician,
bartender, bum...

09:22.157 --> 09:24.017
You actually keep a list?

09:24.117 --> 09:26.017
Yeah, I write about everything.

09:26.117 --> 09:28.117
What?

09:29.877 --> 09:32.137
You know, I was terrified
to call you.

09:32.237 --> 09:34.377
I thought you'd be another
brittle, phoney New Yorker

09:34.477 --> 09:36.017
ready to eat me for breakfast.

09:36.117 --> 09:38.277
I was dreading meeting you.

09:39.397 --> 09:41.877
But I think you and I are gonna
get along just fine.

09:50.077 --> 09:51.617
Hey, Traci!

09:51.717 --> 09:55.897
Traci! I said we have to keep
the door closed, remember?

09:55.997 --> 09:59.757
And it is really time for you
to go to bed now.

10:04.917 --> 10:08.736
Mummy, tell me the story about
when you were a little girl.

10:08.836 --> 10:12.936
Well, I was only a year older
than you

10:13.036 --> 10:14.896
when my daddy decided
it was my turn

10:14.996 --> 10:16.656
to perform in his stage show.

10:16.756 --> 10:18.696
But you forgot the pink bow.

10:18.796 --> 10:21.996
That's right. I had a pink bow
in my hair.

10:23.476 --> 10:26.536
I stepped on the stage
and the light was so bright,

10:26.636 --> 10:28.936
the brightest light
I'd ever seen.

10:29.036 --> 10:30.376
Were you scared?

10:30.476 --> 10:34.296
A little bit but all those
people in the audience

10:34.396 --> 10:36.136
were there to hear me
sing

10:36.236 --> 10:39.696
and I couldn't let them down
because my daddy taught me...

10:39.796 --> 10:42.696
The show must go on.

10:42.796 --> 10:47.616
That's when I knew
that when I grew up

10:47.716 --> 10:49.836
I was going to be a singer.

11:10.996 --> 11:15.936
Lillian, do you think this is
asking too much of Traci?

11:16.036 --> 11:19.055
Do you want to play
in my room?

11:19.155 --> 11:24.735
You are a good mother, OK?
You'll know if it's too much.

11:24.835 --> 11:27.615
I'm not sure I do.

11:27.715 --> 11:29.935
I mean, this is how I grew up.

11:30.035 --> 11:34.095
Our life wasn't exactly normal
but, you know, I thought it was

11:34.195 --> 11:36.535
and that everyone was
in showbusiness.

11:36.635 --> 11:37.855
Well, lucky you.

11:37.955 --> 11:39.655
I grew up in Brisbane.

11:39.755 --> 11:41.955
Showbusiness meant
you owned a television.

11:43.315 --> 11:45.215
I still have my return ticket
to Sydney

11:45.315 --> 11:48.855
so I was thinking that
maybe I go home a while,

11:48.955 --> 11:51.215
save up and then come back
to New York.

11:51.315 --> 11:54.575
No. You and I both know
you won't.

11:54.675 --> 11:56.775
Look, you want to know
what I think?

11:56.875 --> 11:58.015
I think that one day

11:58.115 --> 12:00.855
Traci's going to be grateful
that you stayed.

12:00.955 --> 12:02.535
She had a mother
that taught her

12:02.635 --> 12:04.855
it's OK to follow her dreams.

12:04.955 --> 12:06.415
That, or she'll never be able

12:06.515 --> 12:08.655
to look at
a can of spaghetti again.

12:08.755 --> 12:11.495
Well, my mother writes to me
every week

12:11.595 --> 12:14.775
and tells me I have to choose
between career and marriage.

12:14.875 --> 12:17.015
I tell her we can have both.

12:17.115 --> 12:19.535
Does that mean things are
getting serious with Stevie?

12:19.635 --> 12:20.975
Oh, hardly.

12:21.075 --> 12:24.015
I mean, they're not called
the Easybeats for nothing!

12:24.115 --> 12:27.694
But I do have another project.

12:27.794 --> 12:29.254
An encyclopaedia.

12:29.354 --> 12:31.014
Of rock and roll.

12:31.114 --> 12:33.174
Oh, Lillian, that's incredible!

12:33.274 --> 12:34.894
Or crazy!

12:34.994 --> 12:37.814
No-one's ever done it before,
probably for good reason.

12:37.914 --> 12:39.894
I mean, what if I get as far as
the Bee Gees

12:39.994 --> 12:42.614
and realise that all
I'm good for is beauty tips.

12:42.714 --> 12:44.714
That's definitely not true.

12:46.034 --> 12:49.254
From now on, no-one will tell
us what we can and can't do.

12:49.354 --> 12:50.734
Mummy.

12:50.834 --> 12:53.014
You'll write your
encyclopaedia

12:53.114 --> 12:56.214
and I'll... I'll get
a recording contract.

12:56.314 --> 12:59.614
Oh, so does this mean
you're not going anywhere?

12:59.714 --> 13:01.994
You and me against the world.

13:15.714 --> 13:18.334
Oh, she's here!
I threw you a party.

13:18.434 --> 13:19.974
Lillian, you didn't have to
do this.

13:20.074 --> 13:23.354
Oh, isn't it fabulous?
Here, let's grab this.

13:27.394 --> 13:29.334
You're charging people.

13:29.434 --> 13:32.214
- Well, it's your rent fund.
- It's mortifying!

13:32.314 --> 13:33.893
Oh, what's more mortifying,

13:33.993 --> 13:36.053
being able to pay your rent
or going back to Australia

13:36.153 --> 13:38.153
with your tail
between your legs?

13:41.673 --> 13:44.293
I've never seen him before.

13:44.393 --> 13:48.333
And he also didn't pay.
I can take care of this.

13:48.433 --> 13:51.333
No, that's OK.
This one's on me.

13:51.433 --> 13:53.433
Oh, is it?

13:57.513 --> 13:59.173
Hello.

13:59.273 --> 14:00.813
I'm Helen.

14:00.913 --> 14:03.213
Oh, you must be
the birthday girl.

14:03.313 --> 14:04.813
I am.

14:04.913 --> 14:08.293
And I have absolutely no idea
who you are.

14:08.393 --> 14:10.813
Hm, that's all about to change.

14:10.913 --> 14:14.413
I'm Jeff Wald, manager, work
for the William Morris Agency.

14:14.513 --> 14:16.513
You heard of us?
We're big players.

14:18.473 --> 14:19.773
Nope.

14:19.873 --> 14:24.093
Well, I used to run my own show
with Oscar Brown Jr.

14:24.193 --> 14:25.973
He's a star of the jazz world

14:26.073 --> 14:27.933
but you probably
haven't heard of him

14:28.033 --> 14:30.053
because most people
don't know much about jazz.

14:30.153 --> 14:31.693
Of course I know
Oscar Brown Jr.

14:31.793 --> 14:34.253
All Blues,
originally Miles Davis,

14:34.353 --> 14:36.893
twelve-bar blues
in seventh chords.

14:36.993 --> 14:40.093
You, er, you know
Miles Davis too?

14:40.193 --> 14:43.092
Well, do I need to teach you
about jazz?

14:43.192 --> 14:45.772
Well, that's why I'm at
William Morris, to learn,

14:45.872 --> 14:48.212
see how the game
is really played.

14:48.312 --> 14:49.892
I got big plans.

14:49.992 --> 14:51.772
So have I.

14:51.872 --> 14:53.532
Bigger, even.

14:53.632 --> 14:56.012
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm.

14:56.112 --> 14:58.412
I'm gonna make $1 million
by the time I'm 30.

14:58.512 --> 15:00.532
Well, I'm gonna make
$2 million.

15:00.632 --> 15:02.712
But good for you
to keep it modest.

15:04.352 --> 15:05.692
Oh, shit.

15:05.792 --> 15:09.052
You're from Australia, right?
What are you doing in New York?

15:09.152 --> 15:11.692
- I'm a singer.
- Mm.

15:11.792 --> 15:13.692
You've heard it all before,
right?

15:13.792 --> 15:15.792
Really? No.

15:18.192 --> 15:20.852
Trust me, I'm different.

15:20.952 --> 15:22.732
I'll tell you what.

15:22.832 --> 15:25.132
Why don't we go somewhere
a bit quieter?

15:25.232 --> 15:27.232
I've got some killer weed.

15:28.472 --> 15:30.732
Weed is marijuana.

15:30.832 --> 15:33.352
Yes. I know that.

15:34.632 --> 15:37.432
We have it in Australia.

15:40.992 --> 15:43.412
Well, I can't stay late.

15:43.512 --> 15:45.572
I have a 3-year-old daughter.

15:45.672 --> 15:49.292
Great. I love kids.

15:51.591 --> 15:53.871
Alright, you can hang
those out.

16:19.911 --> 16:21.491
Traci, who is it?

16:21.591 --> 16:23.591
I don't know.

16:24.111 --> 16:26.671
I told you not to open
the door.

16:30.311 --> 16:32.311
Oh! Sorry.

16:34.631 --> 16:37.131
Um...

16:37.231 --> 16:39.231
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:41.231 --> 16:43.211
How did you find me?

16:43.311 --> 16:47.651
I... I'm really connected
in this town.

16:47.751 --> 16:51.851
No, I remembered you said
you were at the Hotel Albert

16:51.951 --> 16:53.951
and I just asked
at the front desk.

16:54.791 --> 16:57.731
- Alright, well, come in.
- Yeah?

16:57.831 --> 16:59.410
Sorry about the mess.

16:59.510 --> 17:02.830
Oh, that's alright.
I was just in the area.

17:07.190 --> 17:11.810
Can I get you something?
Tea or... spaghetti?

17:11.910 --> 17:14.230
No, that's OK, yeah, I'm good,
I'm good.

17:17.150 --> 17:19.810
- Did you bring chess?
- Yes, I brought chess.

17:19.910 --> 17:21.910
Right.

17:54.990 --> 17:56.890
Checkmate.

17:56.990 --> 18:01.250
I guess that means we win.

18:01.350 --> 18:03.810
I guess that means
congratulations.

18:03.910 --> 18:05.910
Thank you.

18:19.829 --> 18:21.729
Are you leaving?

18:21.829 --> 18:24.889
Yeah. I've got some stuff
I've gotta do.

18:24.989 --> 18:28.989
Thanks for the game, though.
Traci, it was good to meet you.

18:41.629 --> 18:43.609
Well, onwards and upwards.

18:43.709 --> 18:46.409
I mean, let's face it,
you can only go up.

18:46.509 --> 18:49.049
Well, I have revised
my dating rules.

18:49.149 --> 18:53.309
No actors, musicians
or men bearing chess sets.

18:59.309 --> 19:01.129
- Tell me about Stevie.
- No!

19:01.229 --> 19:09.369
♪ There are those, I am sure
who have told you

19:09.469 --> 19:15.908
♪ They would give you the world
for a toy

19:17.228 --> 19:24.808
♪ All I have are these arms
to enfold you

19:40.748 --> 19:48.488

♪ That's all... ♪

20:28.707 --> 20:30.807
You won.

20:30.907 --> 20:32.907
I won?

20:37.627 --> 20:40.707
After last time, I went to
the library and studied up.

20:43.067 --> 20:45.067
You make me want to be better.

20:52.667 --> 20:56.847
Oh, my God!
Oh, it's Jeff!

20:56.947 --> 20:59.407
Oh, I read your article on the
San Francisco music scene.

20:59.507 --> 21:01.127
Oh?

21:01.227 --> 21:04.127
Oh, come - I read. Come on,
don't look so surprised.

21:04.227 --> 21:07.007
Grateful Dead, right?
I'm gonna check 'em out.

21:07.107 --> 21:08.807
Well, well.

21:08.907 --> 21:12.487
Music does have charms
to soothe a savage beast.

21:12.587 --> 21:15.127
- Lillian!
- OK, I'll be back.

21:15.227 --> 21:17.227
I'll be back.

21:22.707 --> 21:24.707
Do you want to go with them?

21:26.227 --> 21:28.567
People-watching's
more my style.

21:28.667 --> 21:32.166
Yeah?
You watching me?

21:32.266 --> 21:34.666
I'm not sure I can afford to
take my eyes off you.

21:35.786 --> 21:36.886
That's the way I am.

21:36.986 --> 21:39.646
No-one ever got what they want
standing around waiting for it.

21:39.746 --> 21:41.326
Is that what they teach you
in the Bronx?

21:41.426 --> 21:43.966
My ma did.
She was pretty tough.

21:44.066 --> 21:45.846
What about your dad?

21:45.946 --> 21:48.086
He died when I was a kid.

21:48.186 --> 21:52.906
- Jeff, I'm... I'm so sorry.
- I don't know any different.

22:10.146 --> 22:13.566
Alright, peanut butter
and jelly.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.666
Oh, look at that!

22:18.146 --> 22:19.366
- Jam.
- Jelly.

22:19.466 --> 22:21.726
- It's jam.
- It's jelly.

22:21.826 --> 22:23.726
- Traci, what is it?
- Jam.

22:23.826 --> 22:26.526
- Jam. See? Two against one.
- Traitor.

22:26.626 --> 22:29.806
Bona fide American food.
And the only thing I can cook.

22:29.906 --> 22:31.926
Does it taste good?

22:32.026 --> 22:34.806
The best food I've ever had.

22:34.906 --> 22:36.566
How about that?!

22:36.666 --> 22:39.526
- That's pretty good.
- That is good.

22:39.626 --> 22:40.965
She's a great kid.

22:41.065 --> 22:42.925
Smart kid.

22:43.025 --> 22:44.685
Like her mom.

22:44.785 --> 22:47.045
Sorry - mum.

22:47.145 --> 22:50.245
I bet you say that
to all the single mums.

22:50.345 --> 22:52.865
Sorry - moms.

22:58.785 --> 23:00.045
What are you laughing at?

23:00.145 --> 23:02.145
You're supposed to be
eating your food!

23:22.745 --> 23:24.745
She's finally asleep.

23:33.505 --> 23:35.505
Let me be your manager.

23:36.665 --> 23:39.645
- What?
- Shhh!

23:39.745 --> 23:41.125
Shhh.

23:41.225 --> 23:43.225
I've just been thinking.

23:45.305 --> 23:47.565
We could do this.

23:47.665 --> 23:49.764
You and me together.

23:49.864 --> 23:51.864
A team.

23:52.904 --> 23:56.944
You'll be the show,
I'll be the business.

23:58.144 --> 24:00.464
Come on.

24:01.824 --> 24:03.944
I'll make you a star.

24:05.824 --> 24:07.824
Or maybe I'll make you one.

24:09.744 --> 24:11.744
Maybe.

24:14.904 --> 24:16.124
- Oh, Jesus!
- What?

24:16.224 --> 24:17.324
A fucking cockroach!

24:20.064 --> 24:22.524
Traci's started naming them.

24:22.624 --> 24:25.724
I think that one
might've been called Mr Ed.

24:25.824 --> 24:27.524
Right. My first
managerial decision

24:27.624 --> 24:29.084
is you move out of this dump.

24:29.184 --> 24:30.884
Oh, right.

24:30.984 --> 24:33.684
And where exactly
am I moving to?

24:33.784 --> 24:35.604
Los Angeles?

24:35.704 --> 24:38.844
Well, Jeff thinks LA
will be better for my career.

24:38.944 --> 24:41.964
Well, what about Jeff's job?

24:42.064 --> 24:44.924
Jeff doesn't have one anymore.

24:45.024 --> 24:46.244
William Morris fired him

24:46.344 --> 24:48.324
for selling pot
out of the mailroom.

24:48.424 --> 24:52.884
OK, so your boyfriend,
your unemployed boyfriend,

24:52.984 --> 24:55.044
is gonna be your manager?

24:55.144 --> 24:57.004
Helen, are you sure about this?

24:57.104 --> 25:01.603
All I know is I'm going nowhere
fast in New York and...

25:01.703 --> 25:03.963
..yes, Jeff's my boyfriend

25:04.063 --> 25:06.043
but I'm willing to take
that risk

25:06.143 --> 25:09.343
for someone who finally
believes in me.

25:11.423 --> 25:13.463
I believe in you.

25:16.303 --> 25:18.883
I'm just really going to
miss you, is all.

25:18.983 --> 25:21.223
Well, I'm going to miss you
too.

25:26.263 --> 25:29.923
Look, I'll admit Laurel Canyon
is the place to be right now

25:30.023 --> 25:32.323
so your manager might actually
have a point

25:32.423 --> 25:37.483
but is that the kind of singer
you are?

25:37.583 --> 25:39.883
What do YOU want, Helen?

25:39.983 --> 25:45.183

27:14.741 --> 27:17.021
We'll just need
four months' rent in advance.

27:21.181 --> 27:22.841
Four months' rent in advance?

27:22.941 --> 27:24.401
That's all the money we have.

27:24.501 --> 27:26.001
I'll have to book

27:26.101 --> 27:28.241
every spaghetti house
and dive bar in LA

27:28.341 --> 27:31.041
and you'll have to start
managing the bloody Beatles!

27:31.141 --> 27:34.761
Oh, come on! You gotta
spend money to make money.

27:34.861 --> 27:37.761
Don't you see how LA works?
It's all about image.

27:37.861 --> 27:39.861
Nobody wants to be managed
by a bum.

27:41.821 --> 27:47.481
Look, we get this house,
we get married for real,

27:47.581 --> 27:49.041
I get myself set up

27:49.141 --> 27:52.481
and then we launch
your career.

27:52.581 --> 27:54.581
OK?

27:56.141 --> 27:58.141
Come on.

27:59.101 --> 28:01.101
Come on.

28:03.741 --> 28:05.841
Yes! Yes, yes!

28:05.941 --> 28:07.201
I love you! Yes!

28:07.301 --> 28:08.481
I love you!

28:18.661 --> 28:20.841
Hi. Reservation for Wald.

28:20.941 --> 28:23.140
Certainly, Mr Wald.

28:30.380 --> 28:33.080
Hey, how much longer
are we gonna have to wait?

28:33.180 --> 28:35.080
Our reservation was for
half an hour ago.

28:35.180 --> 28:36.840
These people you seated
just got here.

28:36.940 --> 28:39.860
As soon as your table's
available we'll seat you, sir.

28:44.340 --> 28:47.720
- Let's just go somewhere else.
- No, I want to eat here.

28:47.820 --> 28:50.040
Mr Goldman.
Nice to see you.

28:50.140 --> 28:52.720
Mike. Mike! Hi. How are you?

28:52.820 --> 28:54.360
Good to see you.
Jeff Wald, manager.

28:54.460 --> 28:55.880
I'd love to get together

28:55.980 --> 28:58.600
and talk about some stuff I've
been working on, big stuff.

28:58.700 --> 29:01.420
- Sure. Call my office.
- Great, thanks! Sure thing.

29:05.780 --> 29:08.200
I've lost
Jefferson Airplane.

29:08.300 --> 29:11.280
- Did you try looking up?
- Oh, ha!

29:11.380 --> 29:13.880
I trod on the bloody Beach Boys
again.

29:13.980 --> 29:16.000
I swear this encyclopaedia

29:16.100 --> 29:19.480
is taking over
my entire apartment.

29:19.580 --> 29:22.360
Not to mention my entire life.

29:22.460 --> 29:24.980
And it's wreaking havoc
on my asthma.

29:26.740 --> 29:28.920
How's LA?
Have you gone blind

29:29.020 --> 29:32.119
from the glare of all those
disgustingly healthy tans yet?

29:32.219 --> 29:34.319
Well, I can still see the
Hollywood sign from our window

29:34.419 --> 29:35.999
if I dislocate my neck.

29:36.099 --> 29:40.239
- No!
- Dreams really do come true.

29:40.339 --> 29:42.599
Have you got a gig yet?

29:42.699 --> 29:45.919
Oh, Jeff's trying but,
you know, he's very busy.

29:46.019 --> 29:49.599
He actually just got a job with
a new management company.

29:49.699 --> 29:53.679
He's managing... Tiny Tim.

29:53.779 --> 29:55.779
Tiny Tim?

29:56.299 --> 29:58.719
Oh, God!

30:00.419 --> 30:03.319
Lillian, I miss you.

30:03.419 --> 30:04.639
I'm so bored.

30:04.739 --> 30:05.759
I miss you too.

30:05.859 --> 30:08.319
I was just telling Linda
the other day, actually.

30:08.419 --> 30:09.519
Who's Linda?

30:09.619 --> 30:11.119
Oh, she's this American
photographer

30:11.219 --> 30:12.399
I've become friends with.

30:12.499 --> 30:14.159
Actually, she's coming over
soon.

30:14.259 --> 30:17.199
She's dragging me to this party
tonight 'cause she's decided

30:17.299 --> 30:20.079
she's head over heels in love
with Paul McCartney!

30:20.179 --> 30:22.719
Then we're going to see this
divine singer I've discovered,

30:22.819 --> 30:23.999
David Bowie.

30:24.099 --> 30:26.839
Don't you love how
Englishmen can look effete

30:26.939 --> 30:28.359
but aren't?

30:28.459 --> 30:30.459
Oh, coming!

30:31.779 --> 30:34.159
Oh. Oh! Are you still there?

30:34.259 --> 30:35.639
Yes.

30:35.739 --> 30:37.759
Well, that's Linda,
so I've got to dash

30:37.859 --> 30:41.198
but word is that Betty Friedan

30:41.298 --> 30:42.838
and the National Organization
for Women

30:42.938 --> 30:45.638
are stepping up the Equal
Rights Amendment campaign.

30:45.738 --> 30:47.678
They're going to call on
all women to strike.

30:47.778 --> 30:49.558
I'll report back, OK?

30:49.658 --> 30:53.138
Lots of love, darling.

31:24.778 --> 31:27.098
Morning, sweetheart.
How are you?

31:29.098 --> 31:31.098
- Good, Dad.
- Good.

31:32.178 --> 31:34.278
Hey, Traci, why don't you
go and get ready?

31:34.378 --> 31:35.598
OK, Mum.

31:35.698 --> 31:38.458
We've got to be in the car
in about ten minutes, alright?

31:41.498 --> 31:43.498
Love that home cooking.

31:59.057 --> 32:01.677
Has there been any word on
that gig at the Troubadour yet?

32:01.777 --> 32:04.217
I would've told you
if there was, wouldn't I?

32:07.057 --> 32:08.597
It's like eating cardboard.

32:08.697 --> 32:10.757
Have you chased them up?

32:10.857 --> 32:14.157
How many times do I have to
tell you? I'm busy.

32:14.257 --> 32:16.277
Not a minute's rest
from that douchebag

32:16.377 --> 32:17.917
Tiny fucking Tiny Tim,

32:18.017 --> 32:19.517
Deep Purple are about to
start touring

32:19.617 --> 32:22.297
but, hey, why don't I just drop
everything and call them again?

32:27.297 --> 32:29.797
I was thinking about
going to college.

32:29.897 --> 32:31.637
I'd love to study psychology.

32:31.737 --> 32:35.317
I've always been interested
in what makes people tick.

32:35.417 --> 32:37.697
That's great, Helen.

32:41.097 --> 32:43.317
Maybe they'll have a course
on how to buy milk.

32:43.417 --> 32:46.517
You know, you could go to
the store for once.

32:46.617 --> 32:48.677
Buying milk is not just
my responsibility.

32:48.777 --> 32:51.037
It is! It is your
responsibility.

32:51.137 --> 32:52.757
I'm working to put the milk
on the table,

32:52.857 --> 32:54.397
you gotta go buy the milk.

32:54.497 --> 32:56.157
What are you doing?
What do you do all day?

32:56.257 --> 32:57.476
This place is a fucking pigsty

32:57.576 --> 32:59.596
and all you do is bitch and
moan about getting a gig

32:59.696 --> 33:01.596
and talk bullshit
about how people tick.

33:01.696 --> 33:03.076
Who the fuck cares?!

33:03.176 --> 33:06.596
I didn't sign up to be
some little housewife

33:06.696 --> 33:08.356
to wait on you hand and foot.

33:08.456 --> 33:12.316
You told me that this house was
a stepping stone to my career.

33:12.416 --> 33:13.836
Traci, we've got to go.

33:13.936 --> 33:15.236
I didn't realise my new career

33:15.336 --> 33:18.476
would be cleaning
the bloody thing.

33:18.576 --> 33:20.076
Here. How about that?

33:20.176 --> 33:21.956
- How's that for inspiration?
- Jeff.

33:22.056 --> 33:24.556
Figure out what makes me tick.

33:24.656 --> 33:27.136
Clean this shit up.
There's shit everywhere.

34:17.335 --> 34:19.075
This is
the hardest piece

34:19.175 --> 34:21.395
I have ever had to write
in my life.

34:21.495 --> 34:24.715
I am supposed to be telling
what happened

34:24.815 --> 34:28.515
when 25,000 women marched down
Fifth Avenue last night

34:28.615 --> 34:30.475
on the 50th anniversary
of the day

34:30.575 --> 34:32.595
women won the right to vote.

34:32.695 --> 34:34.555
As is customary in my business,

34:34.655 --> 34:37.955
I am supposed to be telling it
briskly and without bias.

34:38.055 --> 34:39.715
Fat chance!

34:39.815 --> 34:42.895
I am so biased
I can hardly think straight.

34:44.815 --> 34:47.755
If the idea of change makes you
uncomfortable, don't worry.

34:47.855 --> 34:48.915
You're not alone.

34:49.015 --> 34:51.195
All of us ladies agree
this time

34:51.295 --> 34:53.275
that getting there
will be half the fun.

34:53.375 --> 34:54.795
But being there

34:54.895 --> 34:59.775
is going to be an important
part of a brave new world.

35:06.855 --> 35:08.835
A song called Black Night.
Get on there!

Your clients?!

36:07.974 --> 36:11.954
Well, what about
your other client? Me?

36:12.054 --> 36:13.994
You know, we made a deal.

36:14.094 --> 36:16.794

You know how it works.
It's all about timing.

36:23.973 --> 36:26.233
You're just afraid to do
any real work.

36:26.333 --> 36:27.673
You start doing this job

36:27.773 --> 36:29.473
you keep telling me
you're so good at

36:29.573 --> 36:31.573
so I can start doing mine.

36:33.653 --> 36:35.893
I've called everyone in town.

36:37.733 --> 36:39.733
Nobody wants you.

36:41.133 --> 36:43.133
Nobody.

36:45.093 --> 36:46.393
You're wholesome, you know,

36:46.493 --> 36:50.633
you're... you're a housewife,
Helen, let's face it.

36:50.733 --> 36:54.133
And that music,
that's what people want.

36:56.333 --> 36:57.713
You're wrong.

36:57.813 --> 36:59.833
There is a whole lot of 'me's
out there

36:59.933 --> 37:02.513
and we don't want to listen
to that.

37:02.613 --> 37:04.393
Did it ever occur to you men

37:04.493 --> 37:07.133
to ask women
what they want to listen to?

37:11.813 --> 37:13.813
What do you want me to do?

37:27.053 --> 37:28.553
Capitol Records.

37:28.653 --> 37:30.352
Hi, this is Jeff Wald
for Artie Mogull.

37:30.452 --> 37:32.392
Just a moment, Mr Wald.

37:32.492 --> 37:33.912
Great, thanks, sweetheart.

37:34.012 --> 37:36.072
Don't call her sweetheart.
It's demeaning.

37:36.172 --> 37:37.792
- I can hang up this phone!
- Jeff!

37:37.892 --> 37:39.752
- Artie!
- Good to hear from you.

37:39.852 --> 37:41.792
- How you doing?
- You too, buddy. I'm good.

37:41.892 --> 37:45.472
Ah, Artie,
it's your lucky day

37:45.572 --> 37:47.552
'cause I got the next big thing
for you.

37:47.652 --> 37:49.632
She's a star in the making
who can not only sing

37:49.732 --> 37:52.712
but dance, act -
this woman can do it all.

37:52.812 --> 37:54.812
Helen Reddy.

37:56.412 --> 37:58.592
Isn't that your wife?

37:58.692 --> 38:00.992
Yes, it's my fucking wife.
Why do you think I married her?

38:01.092 --> 38:02.872
'Cause she's so
fucking talented.

38:02.972 --> 38:05.072
Look, I'm sure your wife
can sing very nicely.

38:05.172 --> 38:06.912
She's not what we're
looking for.

38:07.012 --> 38:09.552
Artie, the '70s is the decade
of the solo artist.

38:09.652 --> 38:13.192
You got James Taylor,
Carole King, Helen Reddy.

38:13.292 --> 38:14.992
She's Australian too.
How about that?

38:15.092 --> 38:17.472
Yeah, I'm not sure
that's a selling point, Jeff.

38:17.572 --> 38:20.472
Artie, just... You gotta listen
to her, please. Do me a favour.

38:20.572 --> 38:22.872
She's gonna blow you out of
the water, I promise you that.

38:22.972 --> 38:25.992
I'm sorry, Jeff. Helen,
she's just not for us, OK?

38:26.092 --> 38:27.472
But, hey, let's grab lunch
soon.

38:27.572 --> 38:29.612
You call my girl and put
something in the books.

38:31.252 --> 38:33.492
- Alright, thanks, Artie.
- Sure, no problem. Bye.

38:38.452 --> 38:42.111
I'm sorry, honey. I tried.

38:42.211 --> 38:44.711
Is that what you'd say
to Deep Purple?

38:44.811 --> 38:47.711
What do you want me to do?
I can't...

38:47.811 --> 38:49.951
I can't make him
want to see you.

38:50.051 --> 38:51.991
What are you doing?
No, hey!

38:52.091 --> 38:54.091
Alright, alright, alright.

39:04.171 --> 39:05.231
Capitol Records.

39:05.331 --> 39:06.951
Hi, this is Jeff Wald
for Artie Mogull.

39:07.051 --> 39:08.951
Just let me
check if he's free.

39:09.051 --> 39:10.231
OK, thanks.

39:10.331 --> 39:12.711
I'm sorry,
he's on the other line.

39:12.811 --> 39:14.631
Well, I'll hold.

39:14.731 --> 39:16.731
It might take a while, Mr Wald.

39:18.131 --> 39:20.671
OK. Well, just tell him
I called, then.

39:20.771 --> 39:24.151
- Will do.
- Alright, thanks. Bye.

39:24.251 --> 39:27.031
Look, I left word for Artie,
he'll call me back,

39:27.131 --> 39:29.471
I'll set up some dinner here
and you can sing for him then.

39:29.571 --> 39:30.991
- No, no, no, no, no.
- It'll be great.

39:31.091 --> 39:34.391
- What? Come on.
- You're not leaving this room.

39:34.491 --> 39:37.371
Get out of the way, come on.
What are you doing?

40:00.170 --> 40:02.270
Capitol Records.

40:02.370 --> 40:06.270
HI, sweet-Hi. This is Jeff
Wald again for Artie Mogull.

40:06.370 --> 40:09.210

he's still in the same meeting.

40:18.610 --> 40:20.310
Same meeting, huh?

40:20.410 --> 40:22.790
Capitol Records.

40:22.890 --> 40:24.750
Hi. It's Jeff.

40:24.850 --> 40:26.510
Mr Wald, I'm sorry,
he's still in a meeting.

40:26.610 --> 40:28.070
He'll be unavailable all day.

40:28.170 --> 40:30.170
All day?

40:37.130 --> 40:38.990
Hi, Kim, it's Jeff...

40:39.090 --> 40:41.950
Stop tying up
my phone line, Wald!

40:42.050 --> 40:44.230
I haven't had a single call
all day that wasn't you.

40:44.330 --> 40:48.150
Artie, listen. You need to hear
this. You've got to trust me.

40:48.250 --> 40:50.590
Trust me. I know talent
when I see it

40:50.690 --> 40:52.550
and Helen has got it in spades.

40:52.650 --> 40:55.909
You know me!
Just think it over.

I'll call you tomorrow and the
next day and the next day...

40:58.609 --> 41:00.469
- Alright, alright.
- ..and I won't stop.

41:00.569 --> 41:03.589
If I let her record a single
promise to never call again?

41:03.689 --> 41:07.189
Yes! Yes. I will never call
your ass again.

41:07.289 --> 41:09.069

45:47.925 --> 45:50.345
until their phones explode.
Traci?

45:50.445 --> 45:52.025
- Here!
- Oh, here.

45:52.125 --> 45:54.145
It's the snowball effect.

45:54.245 --> 45:56.665
You know, one station plays it,
the next one will play it

45:56.765 --> 45:58.145
and, well, next thing
you know...

45:58.245 --> 46:00.265
You're in the charts.

46:00.365 --> 46:02.025
Alright, let's start dialling.

46:02.125 --> 46:06.265

46:06.365 --> 46:09.265

46:09.365 --> 46:12.225

46:12.325 --> 46:16.745

46:16.845 --> 46:19.185
Whoo-whoo!

46:19.285 --> 46:21.865
Yeah! Yeah.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

46:21.965 --> 46:23.665
Right on! Yeah.

46:23.765 --> 46:24.985
You're gettin' laid tonight!

46:25.085 --> 46:28.305
You're gettin' laid tonight.

46:28.405 --> 46:30.625
I can't request my own song.
I'm not...

46:30.725 --> 46:32.025
Do it. I believe in you.

46:32.125 --> 46:34.585
I can't! What voice
am I meant to do?

46:34.685 --> 46:37.025
- Just southern or something.
- Southern!

46:37.125 --> 46:39.104
I Don't
Know How To Love Him.

46:39.204 --> 46:40.744
I'd like to request
my favourite song.

46:40.844 --> 46:42.704
I Don't Know How To Love Him.

46:42.804 --> 46:45.944
You can do it. Come on.

46:46.044 --> 46:48.264
Oh, my gosh. OK.

46:48.364 --> 46:50.544
Don't look at me
or I'll laugh.

46:50.644 --> 46:52.384
You got it.

46:52.484 --> 46:54.264
Don't say 'mate'.

46:54.364 --> 46:57.624
Hello, I'd
like to request a song, please.

46:57.724 --> 46:59.144
My favourite song.

46:59.244 --> 47:01.684
I Don't Know How To Love Him
by Helen Reddy.

47:03.004 --> 47:06.944
Yes, it's my new favourite
song. I can't get enough of it.

47:07.044 --> 47:09.904
- I love it!
- Thank you.

47:10.004 --> 47:12.344
- Jeff!
- Jeff.

47:12.444 --> 47:15.164
- Can I have a turn?
- You bet, baby. Here.

47:27.924 --> 47:30.104
Is that the radio DJ,
Lillian Roxon?

47:30.204 --> 47:33.864
Oh, my God,
it's Helen 'Number 13' Reddy!

47:33.964 --> 47:36.504
- Hello.
- I've missed you.

47:36.604 --> 47:37.984
I'm so thrilled you came.

47:38.084 --> 47:39.344
Oh, let me get this.

47:39.444 --> 47:42.744
You know me, dropping stuff
everywhere, as always.

47:42.844 --> 47:44.844
- How was the flight?
- Oh, it was great.

47:46.483 --> 47:47.943
I knew you could do it.

47:48.043 --> 47:50.823
The very first encyclopaedia
of rock and roll,

47:50.923 --> 47:53.623
written by a woman.

47:53.723 --> 47:56.863
You'd think I'd be ecstatic
but I wrote an encyclopaedia.

47:56.963 --> 47:58.943
Where do I go from here?

47:59.043 --> 48:02.583
Helen, are you home? Turns out
that piece of shit promoter

48:02.683 --> 48:04.103
hasn't been promoting
the single

48:04.203 --> 48:06.303
so I went into Capitol and
pissed all over his desk.

48:06.403 --> 48:07.823
Hi.

48:07.923 --> 48:09.983
Just another boring day
at the office.

48:10.083 --> 48:11.503
- How are you doing?
- Hello.

48:11.603 --> 48:13.583
- Good to see you.
- You too.

48:13.683 --> 48:18.343
You know, every day I await
new tales of chaos and carnage.

48:18.443 --> 48:20.183
I'd say urine is a first,
though.

48:20.283 --> 48:22.903
You two comedians done?
What's this?

48:23.003 --> 48:24.703
Finally finished
the encyclopaedia.

48:24.803 --> 48:26.463
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thank you.

48:26.563 --> 48:30.703
Wow. It's huge.
Need more pictures.

48:30.803 --> 48:32.983
- You'll never read it.
- I'll never read this.

48:35.243 --> 48:36.623
Hey!

48:36.723 --> 48:39.103
- Seven!
- Hey!

48:39.203 --> 48:42.783
- Eight!
- Hey!

48:42.883 --> 48:44.943
Alright, great work, everybody.

48:45.043 --> 48:47.023
Hi, darling. Hey.

48:47.123 --> 48:48.783
Did you have fun?

48:48.883 --> 48:52.103
I don't want to do kung-fu
anymore.

48:52.203 --> 48:54.862
But why? You were so excited.

48:54.962 --> 48:56.742
Girls at school are teasing me.

48:56.842 --> 48:59.222
Honey, it doesn't matter
what those girls say.

48:59.322 --> 49:01.262
Boys don't like it
when I beat them.

49:01.362 --> 49:03.442
Can't I just do ballet
like the other girls?

49:05.122 --> 49:07.122
Please?

49:08.362 --> 49:13.462
- Traci, you were fabulous!
- Wasn't she?

49:13.562 --> 49:15.622
You were so good!

49:15.722 --> 49:18.062
This one's ridiculous.

49:18.162 --> 49:20.582
"It makes no difference
if you're rich or poor,

49:20.682 --> 49:21.942
"smart or dumb,

49:22.042 --> 49:25.262
"a woman's place in this world
is under some man's thumb."

49:25.362 --> 49:27.142
Please tell me that's ironic.

49:27.242 --> 49:28.742
It gets better.

49:28.842 --> 49:30.902
It goes on to say
that when you're a woman

49:31.002 --> 49:33.542
you're born to be lied to,
cheated on

49:33.642 --> 49:35.382
and treated like dirt.

49:35.482 --> 49:38.262
But, "When your man comes home

49:38.362 --> 49:39.702
"you're glad it happened
that way

49:39.802 --> 49:43.542
"because to be his woman,
no price is too great to pay."

49:43.642 --> 49:46.182
Meanwhile, Capitol want me
to record

49:46.282 --> 49:48.662
the highest-ranking songs
already on the charts.

49:48.762 --> 49:50.102
Oh, bugger that.

49:50.202 --> 49:52.742
That's exactly what I said.
I want my own songs.

49:52.842 --> 49:56.102
Well, go with your instincts.
You're the artist.

49:56.202 --> 49:59.462
And you can never trust anyone
in a suit.

49:59.562 --> 50:01.662
Are we still talking
about Capitol?

50:01.762 --> 50:03.941
Just don't ever let
anyone tell you

50:04.041 --> 50:06.041
you can't do it without them.

50:07.281 --> 50:09.141
Killing Me Softly.

50:09.241 --> 50:10.661
What?

50:12.161 --> 50:14.061
- Let me take that.
- Oh, it's fine.

50:14.161 --> 50:16.481
- Come on.
- OK.

50:21.121 --> 50:23.121
- Hey, Lillian.
- Yeah?

50:24.801 --> 50:27.221
Would you write my album
liner notes?

50:27.321 --> 50:30.141
I know no-one really bothers
with liner notes anymore.

50:30.241 --> 50:33.381
Helen, of course.

50:33.481 --> 50:36.061
You and me against the world,
remember?

50:36.161 --> 50:38.061
Thank you.

50:38.161 --> 50:40.341
At least now there'll be
something on this album

50:40.441 --> 50:42.141
I can be proud of.

50:42.241 --> 50:43.261
Helen Reddy.

50:43.361 --> 50:46.281
Songs to remind you
you're only a woman.

50:48.081 --> 50:49.941
Gotta go.

50:50.041 --> 50:52.161
- Love you.
- Love you.

50:53.681 --> 50:55.101
Lillian.

50:55.201 --> 50:57.141
I feel like you've only just
got here.

50:57.241 --> 50:59.701
I'll see you soon.
Call me when you get in.

50:59.801 --> 51:01.941
I will.

51:02.041 --> 51:04.261
Bye.

Well, it's empowering.

53:38.998 --> 53:42.178
It's a celebration of what
it means to be a woman.

53:42.278 --> 53:43.618
It's man-hating.

53:43.718 --> 53:46.818
I don't hate men.
I'm married to one.

53:46.918 --> 53:48.258
Jeff, you OK with this?

53:48.358 --> 53:49.858
I'm OK with this.

53:49.958 --> 53:53.978
Wait till all this campaigning
leads to unisex toilets.

53:54.078 --> 53:56.898
See how she feels then.

53:56.998 --> 53:59.658
The DJs will never touch it.

53:59.758 --> 54:02.338
- They hate women's libbers.
- What is that word anyway?

54:02.438 --> 54:04.758
I believe in equality.

54:06.398 --> 54:10.658
Look, what my wife, Helen,
is trying to say

54:10.758 --> 54:13.498
is that she's tapped in to
something here.

54:13.598 --> 54:16.378
Remember that march in New York
and how many women showed up?

54:16.478 --> 54:19.698
Imagine that as record sales.

54:19.798 --> 54:23.458
A bunch of record sales
marching down the street.

54:23.558 --> 54:24.938
I still think it sounds angry.

54:25.038 --> 54:27.538
Come on, Artie. There's
no such thing as bad publicity.

54:27.638 --> 54:30.598
Yeah, but I don't know
about this one.

54:32.198 --> 54:33.978
Well, let's just bury it
on the album.

54:34.078 --> 54:36.218
No-one will listen to
the whole thing anyway.

54:36.318 --> 54:38.317
Well, that's true.

54:39.197 --> 54:42.157
What are you doing?
Ready to go?

54:45.917 --> 54:47.897
What the hell was that?

54:47.997 --> 54:50.457
Maybe Artie's right.
You do sound kind of angry.

54:50.557 --> 54:51.817
This is important, Jeff.

54:51.917 --> 54:54.137
This is more than just a song
to me.

54:54.237 --> 54:55.737
So trust me.

54:55.837 --> 54:57.577
We're gonna pretend to play
their game

54:57.677 --> 54:59.657
but we're going to get
I Am Woman out there,

54:59.757 --> 55:01.757
you and me, whatever it takes.

55:03.597 --> 55:05.697
What, we call
the radio stations again?

55:05.797 --> 55:09.377
Yes, but this time
it's not us calling.

55:09.477 --> 55:11.057
Alright, then, who is?

55:11.157 --> 55:13.457
Women.

55:13.557 --> 55:16.097
Based on their excitement at
finding it buried on the album?

55:16.197 --> 55:18.897
No. We book you in every venue
and club

55:18.997 --> 55:20.697
and you are going to sing
I Am Woman

55:20.797 --> 55:23.497
and the women
are going to love it.

55:23.597 --> 55:25.597
Yes.

55:27.637 --> 55:31.457
Alright. You see those two?

55:31.557 --> 55:33.297
Easy target.

55:33.397 --> 55:36.617
It's those ones.

It's the wives out on the town
you gotta get.

55:39.597 --> 55:40.897

Thank you.

1:00:02.153 --> 1:00:03.293
I only have ten seconds

1:00:03.393 --> 1:00:05.933
so I'd like to thank everyone
concerned at Capitol Records,

1:00:06.033 --> 1:00:07.493
I would like to thank
Jeff Wald

1:00:07.593 --> 1:00:09.613
because he makes
my success possible

1:00:09.713 --> 1:00:11.013
and I would like to thank God

1:00:11.113 --> 1:00:13.293
because she makes everything
possible.

1:00:26.192 --> 1:00:28.312
Over here!

1:00:30.792 --> 1:00:32.652
Fuck you!

1:00:32.752 --> 1:00:34.752
Fuck you very much.

1:00:36.032 --> 1:00:38.032
Thank you. Appreciate it.

1:00:41.992 --> 1:00:43.452
That's Helen Reddy.

1:00:43.552 --> 1:00:45.972
Good evening, Mr Wald,
Miss Reddy.

1:00:46.072 --> 1:00:47.972
Hey, Jeff, Jeff Wald.

1:00:48.072 --> 1:00:50.652
Helen, I'm a big fan.

1:00:50.752 --> 1:00:52.612
My wife won't stop playing
your record.

1:00:52.712 --> 1:00:54.132
Are you interested in movies,
Helen?

1:00:54.232 --> 1:00:55.532
Abso-fucking-lutely, she is.

1:00:55.632 --> 1:00:57.332
Call my office,
we'll set something up.

1:00:57.432 --> 1:00:59.452
Get these fellas a bottle
of your best champagne.

1:00:59.552 --> 1:01:01.652
- Dinner's on us.
- Jeff, he's the greatest.

1:01:01.752 --> 1:01:03.612
You're the man! Isn't he?

1:01:03.712 --> 1:01:05.932
Enjoy your evening.

1:01:06.032 --> 1:01:07.772
Wasn't that a tad extravagant?

1:01:07.872 --> 1:01:09.932
Baby, you just bought a house
in cash.

1:01:10.032 --> 1:01:12.172
Champagne and a couple of
entrees is pocket change.

1:01:12.272 --> 1:01:13.972
Besides, we're celebrating.

1:01:14.072 --> 1:01:15.972
Well, speaking of celebrating,

1:01:16.072 --> 1:01:19.812
one of the first women
in America.

1:01:19.912 --> 1:01:22.292
No 'Mrs', no nothing,
just my very own name.

1:01:22.392 --> 1:01:24.572
Way to go, baby.
Drinks are on you.

1:01:24.672 --> 1:01:27.012
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not using it.

1:01:27.112 --> 1:01:28.891
We pay cash, like always.

1:01:28.991 --> 1:01:31.051
- Complimentary hors d'oeuvres.
- Thanks.

1:01:31.151 --> 1:01:33.931
I was thinking about inviting
Lillian to fly out.

1:01:34.031 --> 1:01:36.051
I'd like her to be the first
to see the house.

1:01:36.151 --> 1:01:37.651
Hey, did you read
Lillian's article

1:01:37.751 --> 1:01:38.971
on Paul and Linda's
TV special?

1:01:39.071 --> 1:01:41.351
- No.
- She is vicious.

1:01:45.471 --> 1:01:47.291
"Did you see them
in that pub scene?

1:01:47.391 --> 1:01:49.291
"Paul's congenial
as all get-out.

1:01:49.391 --> 1:01:50.811
"Linda's catatonic with horror

1:01:50.911 --> 1:01:53.091
"at having to mingle
with ordinary people.

1:01:53.191 --> 1:01:54.971
"Linda comes across

1:01:55.071 --> 1:01:56.971
"as an incredibly cold
and arrogant figure,

1:01:57.071 --> 1:02:00.451
"coming to life only when the
TV cameras are focused on her."

1:02:00.551 --> 1:02:01.851
- Ooh.
- Jesus.

1:02:01.951 --> 1:02:04.091
You watch what you tell
Lillian, right?

1:02:04.191 --> 1:02:06.851
What do you mean?

1:02:06.951 --> 1:02:10.131
I mean, you're careful
about what you say to her?

1:02:10.231 --> 1:02:13.131
After reading that, I sure
as shit wouldn't cross her.

1:02:13.231 --> 1:02:16.571
Lillian doesn't believe
in reporting gossip.

1:02:16.671 --> 1:02:18.891
She would never betray
my confidence.

1:02:18.991 --> 1:02:20.531
Yeah, I know she's your friend

1:02:20.631 --> 1:02:22.531
but at the end of the day
Lillian's ambitious

1:02:22.631 --> 1:02:24.331
and she's not going to let
anything

1:02:24.431 --> 1:02:26.431
stand in the way of her
and a story.

1:02:27.671 --> 1:02:29.811
Let's just agree to disagree,
OK?

1:02:29.911 --> 1:02:31.891
Wouldn't be the first time.

1:02:31.991 --> 1:02:34.611
Helen Reddy is with us tonight,
she's a superb singer,

1:02:34.711 --> 1:02:35.611
and, as you know,

1:02:35.711 --> 1:02:37.650
she starred in her own summer
television series

1:02:37.750 --> 1:02:39.330
and is well on her way
to become

1:02:39.430 --> 1:02:41.890
I think the first artist
besides the Beatles as a group

1:02:41.990 --> 1:02:44.730
who had three number one
records in a single year.

1:02:44.830 --> 1:02:46.770
She's going to do
a couple of numbers for us

1:02:46.870 --> 1:02:49.250
and one of them is her latest
big hit called Leave Me Alone.

1:02:49.350 --> 1:02:51.090
Would you welcome, please,
Miss Helen Reddy?

1:02:58.790 --> 1:03:05.270

Excuse me, Helen, I need
your signature on this.

1:04:21.709 --> 1:04:23.329
Hey, I'll sign for that.

1:04:23.429 --> 1:04:25.289
Oh, that's alright,
he signs everything for me.

1:04:25.389 --> 1:04:27.689
Lillian Roxon called for you
again.

1:04:27.789 --> 1:04:30.289
Yes, I'll call her back.

1:04:30.389 --> 1:04:31.649
Can you make sure
the announcer

1:04:31.749 --> 1:04:33.969
knows to start the show with
"Good evening, everyone,"

1:04:34.069 --> 1:04:35.969
- not "Ladies and gentlemen"?
- Sure.

1:04:36.069 --> 1:04:37.529
What do you think of
Alice Cooper

1:04:37.629 --> 1:04:39.609
dubbing you "the queen of
housewife rock"?

1:04:39.709 --> 1:04:41.929
I love it.
Alice is just fabulous.

1:04:42.029 --> 1:04:44.209
Is it true you don't wear a bra
on television?

1:04:44.309 --> 1:04:47.549
Would you ask a man
if he wears underwear?

1:04:48.709 --> 1:04:50.709
We've got to wrap this up.

1:04:51.349 --> 1:04:52.689
Now the Equal Rights Amendment

1:04:52.789 --> 1:04:54.768
is only eight states short of
the required majority

1:04:54.868 --> 1:04:56.888
to change our Constitution,
what do you think of

1:04:56.988 --> 1:04:59.288
conservative political activist
Phyllis Schlafly

1:04:59.388 --> 1:05:01.928
calling on women
to fight against ERA

1:05:02.028 --> 1:05:04.368
and her claims it will
disadvantage housewives

1:05:04.468 --> 1:05:06.128
and take away the privileges
of womanhood?

1:05:06.228 --> 1:05:07.728
I disagree.

1:05:07.828 --> 1:05:09.968
I happen to believe
it's high time

1:05:10.068 --> 1:05:12.168
the Bill of Rights be applied
equally to women.

1:05:12.268 --> 1:05:14.568
Why wouldn't we want
a constitution

1:05:14.668 --> 1:05:16.128
against sex discrimination?

1:05:16.228 --> 1:05:18.228
Alright. We're good, right?

1:05:18.988 --> 1:05:21.388
And, Jeff, a few questions
for you?

1:05:23.908 --> 1:05:25.908
Alright.

1:05:27.348 --> 1:05:29.788
How does it feel to be
Mr Helen Reddy?

1:05:31.948 --> 1:05:34.168
It's pretty good, actually.

1:05:34.268 --> 1:05:36.968
But to have a wife who's
written the unofficial anthem

1:05:37.068 --> 1:05:38.488
of the women's movement

1:05:38.588 --> 1:05:40.248
and is the breadwinner
in your home,

1:05:40.348 --> 1:05:42.588
isn't that emasculating?

1:05:44.148 --> 1:05:46.568
Well, Jeff and I are a team.

1:05:46.668 --> 1:05:48.008
We're equals.

1:05:48.108 --> 1:05:50.728
You know, it's not my career,
it's our career.

1:05:50.828 --> 1:05:53.668
I'm here now because of Jeff.

1:05:55.228 --> 1:05:57.728
So he tells me.

1:05:57.828 --> 1:05:59.768
Jeff hasn't got a modest bone
in his body

1:05:59.868 --> 1:06:02.567
but that's what makes him sexy.

1:06:02.667 --> 1:06:04.247
So a final question, Helen.

1:06:04.347 --> 1:06:05.807
When is a woman liberated?

1:06:05.907 --> 1:06:08.607
You mean when is a person
liberated?

1:06:08.707 --> 1:06:11.167
When they're no longer
discriminated against

1:06:11.267 --> 1:06:13.047
by the society.

1:06:13.147 --> 1:06:14.807
Hey, look around you.

1:06:14.907 --> 1:06:16.927
She looks pretty fucking
liberated to me.

1:06:17.027 --> 1:06:19.027
We done now?

1:06:45.747 --> 1:06:47.807
Can you please drop me off
here?

1:06:47.907 --> 1:06:51.527
What are you, a tourist?
We're on a schedule.

1:06:51.627 --> 1:06:54.127
What if I forgo my next
bathroom break?

1:06:54.227 --> 1:06:56.247
I assume we're scheduling
those now too?

1:06:56.347 --> 1:06:58.247
I'm getting out.

1:06:58.347 --> 1:06:59.607
Like hell you are.

1:06:59.707 --> 1:07:01.687
What's wrong with you?
Can you stop, please?

1:07:01.787 --> 1:07:03.527
If you stop, I'll kill you.
Keep going.

1:07:03.627 --> 1:07:06.787
Hey, listen to me, both of
you. I'm getting out. Now.

1:07:08.347 --> 1:07:10.326
If that's the way you're
gonna be, I'm getting out.

1:07:10.426 --> 1:07:11.806
- Pull over.
- Jeff, stop it!

1:07:11.906 --> 1:07:12.966
Move out of my way.

1:07:13.066 --> 1:07:14.926
Stop it!
It's just the drugs.

1:07:15.026 --> 1:07:16.726
- Look...
- Get back in the car!

1:07:16.826 --> 1:07:19.746
Look at me! I can get out of
the car too, whenever I want.

1:07:24.426 --> 1:07:26.426
Well, I guess we're both
getting out.

1:07:40.986 --> 1:07:43.446
Lillian, what's wrong?

1:07:43.546 --> 1:07:45.766
You don't look well.

1:07:45.866 --> 1:07:47.866
I... I stopped dieting.

1:07:49.746 --> 1:07:50.886
It was making me miserable

1:07:50.986 --> 1:07:53.526
and I was fighting a losing
battle with the cortisone

1:07:53.626 --> 1:07:55.926
so I figured I might as well
become a blimp

1:07:56.026 --> 1:07:57.766
and be done with it.

1:07:57.866 --> 1:07:59.866
Has your asthma got worse?

1:08:02.346 --> 1:08:04.986
I'm sick of taking drugs
but I've no choice, and...

1:08:06.266 --> 1:08:08.126
..the smog isn't helping either

1:08:08.226 --> 1:08:14.146
and with the newspaper,
the radio show and the...

1:08:16.226 --> 1:08:17.606
..and the magazines,

1:08:17.706 --> 1:08:20.925
I feel like I'm perpetually
two steps behind myself.

1:08:21.025 --> 1:08:23.025
Oh, I know that feeling.

1:08:36.305 --> 1:08:38.305
These are beautiful.

1:08:39.465 --> 1:08:44.125
The gorgeous David Bowie.
He heard I was sick.

1:08:44.225 --> 1:08:47.765
I guess not everyone forgets
about you.

1:08:47.865 --> 1:08:49.485
What's that supposed to mean?

1:08:49.585 --> 1:08:51.825
You haven't been
returning my calls.

1:08:53.345 --> 1:08:55.645
Never figured you to be one

1:08:55.745 --> 1:08:57.685
to forget your friends
when you're famous.

1:08:57.785 --> 1:09:02.265
I've been busy too, the tour,
the TV show, the kids.

1:09:07.385 --> 1:09:10.065
I read your review
of Linda's show.

1:09:11.545 --> 1:09:14.765
What's Linda got to do
with anything?

1:09:14.865 --> 1:09:17.005
Well, I was surprised.

1:09:17.105 --> 1:09:19.765
I thought Linda was
supposed to be your friend.

1:09:19.865 --> 1:09:21.865
Yeah, well, so did I.

1:09:26.425 --> 1:09:29.424
Then she became
Mrs Paul McCartney and...

1:09:30.824 --> 1:09:32.824
..I didn't seem to...

1:09:33.384 --> 1:09:36.284
..to matter much anymore.

1:09:36.384 --> 1:09:40.744
But I thought you didn't
believe in making it personal.

1:09:42.064 --> 1:09:44.064
It wasn't personal.

1:09:45.224 --> 1:09:48.064
I report the truth and the
truth is the show was terrible.

1:09:50.184 --> 1:09:54.724
I can be a little caustic
sometimes, is all.

1:09:54.824 --> 1:09:56.824
A little?!

1:09:58.344 --> 1:09:59.964
Lillian, you were pretty tough.

1:10:00.064 --> 1:10:02.344
Why are you defending Linda?

1:10:10.824 --> 1:10:13.264
That's why you haven't been
returning my phone calls.

1:10:16.944 --> 1:10:20.484
You thought that I would write
about you?

1:10:20.584 --> 1:10:22.884
How could you think that
about me?

1:10:22.984 --> 1:10:25.204
Well, I have a family.

1:10:25.304 --> 1:10:28.564
You know, I have to be careful,
for their sake.

1:10:28.664 --> 1:10:30.704
I want my private life
to stay private.

1:10:32.424 --> 1:10:36.763
Oh, is that right,
Miss Helen Reddy,

1:10:36.863 --> 1:10:39.383
international superstar?

1:10:42.023 --> 1:10:45.003
And how many houses
do you have, huh?

1:10:45.103 --> 1:10:47.603
And cars?

1:10:47.703 --> 1:10:51.263
Have you bought a jet yet or is
that for the next Grammy win?

1:10:53.543 --> 1:10:55.543
Way to keep it private.

1:10:57.663 --> 1:10:59.983
You can't have it both ways,
Helen.

1:11:09.623 --> 1:11:11.623
I have to go.

1:11:13.383 --> 1:11:14.843
Of course.

1:11:14.943 --> 1:11:18.243
Run back to Jeff like always.

1:11:18.343 --> 1:11:23.103
Helen Reddy, striking
another blow for feminism.

1:11:26.903 --> 1:11:28.903
These are for the show
tomorrow night.

1:11:30.183 --> 1:11:32.183
I hope you can make it.

1:11:54.822 --> 1:11:57.862

- I didn't say goodbye.

1:15:41.739 --> 1:15:43.739

1:15:48.859 --> 1:15:51.079

This is the job.

You cannot check in and out

1:17:11.178 --> 1:17:12.238
It doesn't work like that.

1:17:12.338 --> 1:17:14.338
I'm sorry, Helen,
but it doesn't.

1:17:17.618 --> 1:17:19.558

The Equal Rights
Amendment

1:19:55.215 --> 1:19:57.875
must be ratified by three more
states by June 30th

1:19:57.975 --> 1:19:59.075
or it will die.

1:19:59.175 --> 1:20:00.275
Illinois is one state

1:20:00.375 --> 1:20:02.195
where supporters are using
extreme tactics

1:20:02.295 --> 1:20:03.915
in an effort to pass
the measure

1:20:04.015 --> 1:20:05.315
in the few weeks remaining.

1:20:05.415 --> 1:20:07.515
Throw away
ERA, throw away ERA!

1:20:07.615 --> 1:20:09.675
In Illinois,
ERA's been up ten times

1:20:09.775 --> 1:20:11.155
and lost ten times.

1:20:11.255 --> 1:20:13.435
ERA's most prominent opponent,
Phyllis Schlafly,

1:20:13.535 --> 1:20:16.155
said she'd never have to
return to Springfield.

1:20:16.255 --> 1:20:17.835
Well, Schlafly's back.

1:20:17.935 --> 1:20:19.595
Women found out
what it will do.

1:20:19.695 --> 1:20:22.915
They found out that ERA will
take away rights of women,

1:20:23.015 --> 1:20:25.995
such as women's exemption
from the military draft.

1:20:26.095 --> 1:20:28.995
They also found out ERA
will give more power

1:20:29.095 --> 1:20:30.475
to the Federal Government.

1:20:30.575 --> 1:20:32.355
Opponents of ERA
also charged

1:20:32.455 --> 1:20:34.075
that it would legalise
prostitution

1:20:34.175 --> 1:20:35.715
and homosexual marriages

1:20:35.815 --> 1:20:38.755
and it would require unisex
bathrooms and destroy families.

1:20:38.855 --> 1:20:41.715
- God, she's ridiculous.
- 35 states have...

1:20:41.815 --> 1:20:44.035
You sold out again last night?

1:20:44.135 --> 1:20:45.515
- Hmm?
- Vegas.

1:20:45.615 --> 1:20:47.115
Oh, yes.

and midnight.

1:20:49.535 --> 1:20:51.035

how you do it.

I think I'd like to be a writer
when I grow up.

1:21:34.334 --> 1:21:36.274
Well, then, that's what
you should do.

1:21:36.374 --> 1:21:38.694

tell you otherwise.

1:21:39.934 --> 1:21:41.594

1:21:41.694 --> 1:21:42.994

1:21:43.094 --> 1:21:44.314

1:21:44.414 --> 1:21:46.314
then Lucas and I are gonna grab

1:21:46.414 --> 1:21:49.434

1:21:49.534 --> 1:21:52.154
What have I said about teasing
your sister before breakfast?

1:21:52.254 --> 1:21:54.634
I caught Traci practising
her graduation speech

1:21:54.734 --> 1:21:56.474
- in the mirror.
- Jordan, shut up.

1:21:56.574 --> 1:22:00.513
Traci, you're giving a speech?
That's wonderful!

1:22:00.613 --> 1:22:02.233
Why didn't you tell me?

1:22:02.333 --> 1:22:04.333
Because graduation
isn't in Vegas.

1:22:14.733 --> 1:22:17.433
Helen. I'm Kevin.

1:22:17.533 --> 1:22:18.993

the album release now.

1:22:28.813 --> 1:22:30.513

1:22:30.613 --> 1:22:31.833
I'm a big, big fan.

1:22:31.933 --> 1:22:34.473
Well, I've been touring
non-stop these past few years,

1:22:34.573 --> 1:22:36.233
plus the Vegas season

1:22:36.333 --> 1:22:37.553
so I'm looking forward to

1:22:37.653 --> 1:22:39.233
getting back into the studio
again.

1:22:39.333 --> 1:22:41.153
We are really excited
to hear that.

1:22:41.253 --> 1:22:44.193
You are one of MCA's
most-valuable artists

1:22:44.293 --> 1:22:47.033
- and we are so...
- Excited.

1:22:47.133 --> 1:22:48.953
Yes. Thank you.

1:22:49.053 --> 1:22:51.313
I'm thinking about
going back to my roots

1:22:51.413 --> 1:22:52.873
and doing a jazz album.

1:22:52.973 --> 1:22:55.073
We should probably wait
for Jeff, shouldn't we,

1:22:55.173 --> 1:22:56.793
if we're going to start
talking business?

1:22:56.893 --> 1:22:58.793
Well, Jeff isn't here, is he?

1:22:58.893 --> 1:23:01.473
And I'm the one recording the
album so I'd like to start...

1:23:01.573 --> 1:23:03.113
- Hey!
- Jeff!

1:23:03.213 --> 1:23:04.953
There he is.
Kevin, what's going on?

1:23:05.053 --> 1:23:06.753
You're looking huge!
Been working out?

1:23:06.853 --> 1:23:09.512
Hey, congratulations on Rocky
III. I hear it was green lit.

1:23:09.612 --> 1:23:11.672

1:23:18.132 --> 1:23:19.712
Shall we get down
to business?

1:23:19.812 --> 1:23:22.072
I was just saying
we have a bunch of ideas

1:23:22.172 --> 1:23:23.592
- for the new album.
- Great.

1:23:23.692 --> 1:23:26.072
I was saying to Kevin
I want to do a jazz album.

1:23:26.172 --> 1:23:28.792
The problem is jazz
is kinda niche

1:23:28.892 --> 1:23:31.792
and after the last album sales
we need to be cautious.

1:23:31.892 --> 1:23:33.472
Whatever you guys think, Kevin.

1:23:33.572 --> 1:23:35.792
I know we're in good hands
at MCA.

1:23:35.892 --> 1:23:37.512
I'm not doing it.

1:23:37.612 --> 1:23:39.952
OK, she's not doing it.

1:23:40.052 --> 1:23:42.312
Come on, Helen. These guys know
what they're talking about.

1:23:42.412 --> 1:23:44.412
What, are you serious?

1:23:46.092 --> 1:23:47.432
She'll do it.

1:23:47.532 --> 1:23:48.992
- She won't.
- Yes, she will.

1:23:49.092 --> 1:23:51.252
- No, she...
- Yes, she will!

1:23:57.812 --> 1:23:59.892
Get the fuck out of here,
Kevin.

1:24:05.572 --> 1:24:06.952

1:24:07.052 --> 1:24:08.912

What are you talking about?

1:24:14.812 --> 1:24:16.911
You never used to care
what the record label said.

1:24:17.011 --> 1:24:18.711
You think I care
about a fucking record label?

1:24:18.811 --> 1:24:20.551
You think I'm scared
of a record label?

1:24:20.651 --> 1:24:22.651

1:24:27.451 --> 1:24:30.411

things used to be.

1:24:32.931 --> 1:24:36.111
And I... I miss you.

1:24:36.211 --> 1:24:39.151

I haven't seen you...

1:24:39.251 --> 1:24:40.951

1:24:41.051 --> 1:24:43.551

1:24:43.651 --> 1:24:45.511

1:24:45.611 --> 1:24:46.911
I haven't been talking to
anybody.

1:24:48.771 --> 1:24:50.591
- Jeff, stop it!
- You don't need me anymore?

1:24:50.691 --> 1:24:53.031
I'm the best fucking manager
there is in this town, OK?

1:24:53.131 --> 1:24:54.671

to ratify
the Equal Rights Amendment

three states short

most publicly for its defeat

is Phyllis Schlafly, the head
of Eagle Forum and Stop ERA.

consistently shown

1:30:45.046 --> 1:30:47.266
majority support for ERA.

- The polls...
- Let me just finish.

1:30:49.126 --> 1:30:51.986
Isn't this really a victory
for a vocal minority?

1:30:52.086 --> 1:30:55.466
Mrs Schlafly, is ERA dead?
Really dead?

1:30:55.566 --> 1:30:59.466
ERA died three years ago
when it ran out of time.

1:30:59.566 --> 1:31:01.566
Mom! Mom!

1:31:02.006 --> 1:31:03.826

Mom! Are you OK?

1:31:08.525 --> 1:31:10.525
When are you coming home?

1:31:18.885 --> 1:31:20.705
I'm very sorry, Ms Reddy,

1:31:20.805 --> 1:31:23.585
we're unable to fill this
until your account is paid.

1:31:23.685 --> 1:31:25.685
What do you mean,
it hasn't been paid?

1:31:27.005 --> 1:31:28.865
That's ridiculous.

1:31:28.965 --> 1:31:30.905
It's been overdue
for some time now.

1:31:31.005 --> 1:31:33.185
We sent several notices
but we haven't received...

1:31:33.285 --> 1:31:35.785
Jerry, it's Helen.

1:31:35.885 --> 1:31:37.065
I'm at the drugstore

1:31:37.165 --> 1:31:39.345
and they're telling me
that our account is overdue.

1:31:39.445 --> 1:31:42.065
My credit card's not working
either.

1:31:42.165 --> 1:31:43.505
What's going on?

1:31:43.605 --> 1:31:45.465
I'm Jeff's accountant.
I work for him.

1:31:45.565 --> 1:31:47.625
If you have any questions,
you need to ask him.

1:31:47.725 --> 1:31:49.845
What?

1:31:53.205 --> 1:31:54.465
I finally get up there,

1:31:54.565 --> 1:31:56.305
I find the room's trashed,
bed's broken,

1:31:56.405 --> 1:31:58.745
hair clogging up the drain,
TV disconnected.

1:31:58.845 --> 1:32:01.105
So I tracked him down...

1:32:01.205 --> 1:32:03.845
Oh, ladies and gentlemen,
Helen Reddy in the flesh!

1:32:06.725 --> 1:32:08.725
What the fuck?

1:32:35.884 --> 1:32:38.424
Helen!

1:32:38.524 --> 1:32:39.944

1:32:46.604 --> 1:32:48.784
Unpaid school fees.

1:32:48.884 --> 1:32:50.624
We owe money on the last tour.

1:32:50.724 --> 1:32:53.024
Jeff. there's loans out
against our life insurance.

1:32:53.124 --> 1:32:55.664
I know, I know, this fucking
new business manager,

1:32:55.764 --> 1:32:58.424
he put all this money
in these offshore investments

1:32:58.524 --> 1:33:00.344
and he fucked us.

1:33:00.444 --> 1:33:01.584
I didn't want to tell you

1:33:01.684 --> 1:33:03.864
because I've been trying
to put it right.

1:33:03.964 --> 1:33:05.964
Is there anything left?

1:33:10.084 --> 1:33:12.084
Look at me!

1:33:17.244 --> 1:33:19.704
We still have the house, right?

1:33:19.804 --> 1:33:21.804
Oh, my God.

1:33:24.683 --> 1:33:26.823
The accountant took out
a double mortgage

1:33:26.923 --> 1:33:28.543
because we've got to pay back
the loans

1:33:28.643 --> 1:33:30.183
and then there's the taxes.

1:33:30.283 --> 1:33:33.623
Jeff.
What have you done?

1:33:33.723 --> 1:33:35.343
I haven't done anything!
It's not my fault!

1:33:35.443 --> 1:33:36.943
It's the fuckin' business
manager.

1:33:37.043 --> 1:33:39.043
I don't want to hear it!

1:33:39.603 --> 1:33:42.783
YOU were supposed to be
taking care of business.

1:33:42.883 --> 1:33:46.223
I mean, Jeff, we have lost our
home, our children's home...

1:33:46.323 --> 1:33:47.743
We've lost everything, Jeff!

1:33:47.843 --> 1:33:49.983
I can't do everything, Helen!

1:33:50.083 --> 1:33:51.983
Look, I know I fell asleep
at the wheel

1:33:52.083 --> 1:33:53.903
and I should've kept
a better eye on things

1:33:54.003 --> 1:33:55.903
but I promise you
that's all gonna change.

1:33:56.003 --> 1:33:57.023
- Stop it!
- Just stop.

1:33:57.123 --> 1:33:59.103
You got the Vegas shows,
you're gonna do the new album.

1:33:59.203 --> 1:34:00.343
I'll go clean, I'll go sober.

1:34:00.443 --> 1:34:02.703
I'll fuckin' never touch the
stuff again. I'm begging you.

1:34:02.803 --> 1:34:04.903
Please. Look. I can turn
this thing around, Helen.

1:34:05.003 --> 1:34:07.223
Please, we can do this,
we can do this together.

1:34:07.323 --> 1:34:08.703
Me and you.

1:34:08.803 --> 1:34:10.823
Just... Please, baby.
We're a team.

1:34:10.923 --> 1:34:12.183
We're not a team, Jeff.

1:34:12.283 --> 1:34:13.983
- We are.
- We're not.

1:34:14.083 --> 1:34:16.083
No!

1:34:17.203 --> 1:34:19.983
We're not anymore.

1:34:20.083 --> 1:34:22.683
I can't do this anymore.

1:34:25.803 --> 1:34:27.803
What did you say to me?

1:34:30.043 --> 1:34:31.663
After all that I fucking did
for you?

1:34:31.763 --> 1:34:33.422
After all that we've
been through together

1:34:33.522 --> 1:34:35.262
you're gonna fucking leave me

1:34:35.362 --> 1:34:36.782
I made you a fucking star!

1:34:36.882 --> 1:34:39.462
No-one would even know who you
were if it wasn't for me.

1:34:39.562 --> 1:34:41.842
Well, no-one would know you
if it wasn't for me.

1:34:43.562 --> 1:34:44.782
No, no, no, no.

1:34:44.882 --> 1:34:48.702
Helen, you leave

1:34:48.802 --> 1:34:49.942

1:38:48.559 --> 1:38:51.959
We're good. Both busy with work
but we're good.

1:38:55.759 --> 1:38:57.779
I had another call

1:38:57.879 --> 1:39:00.139
from the National Organization
for Women.

1:39:00.239 --> 1:39:02.619
They're organising a rally,
Mobilize for Women's Rights,

1:39:02.719 --> 1:39:04.659
and they want to know
if you'll perform.

1:39:04.759 --> 1:39:06.258
You told them
I don't sing anymore?

1:39:06.358 --> 1:39:08.058
Of course I told them.

1:39:08.158 --> 1:39:09.778
They asked if you'd make
an exception,

1:39:09.878 --> 1:39:12.498
just one performance
for a cause you believe in.

1:39:12.598 --> 1:39:15.298
Aren't there plenty of young
female singers out there

1:39:15.398 --> 1:39:16.578
who'd love to be part of it?

1:39:16.678 --> 1:39:19.998
- Mom, they want you.
- No, they want the old Helen.

1:39:21.398 --> 1:39:23.458
And that was another lifetime.

1:39:23.558 --> 1:39:25.538
What happened to
"The show must go on"?

1:39:25.638 --> 1:39:27.218
Traci, please.

1:39:27.318 --> 1:39:30.838
Look, I've made my choice
and I can't go back.

1:39:36.638 --> 1:39:39.138
"Helen Reddy is a certain sort
of woman

1:39:39.238 --> 1:39:41.498
"who is remarkably
without artifice."

1:39:41.598 --> 1:39:42.698
Please, Traci.

1:39:42.798 --> 1:39:44.418
I know you gave
everything away

1:39:44.518 --> 1:39:47.158
but I thought it might be time
to revisit this.

1:39:51.358 --> 1:39:53.978
Helen Reddy
is a certain sort of woman

1:39:54.078 --> 1:39:56.698
who is remarkably
without artifice

1:39:56.798 --> 1:39:58.498
and remarkably without fear,

1:39:58.598 --> 1:40:01.218
who is made uncomfortable
by polite lies,

1:40:01.318 --> 1:40:04.338
who refuses to face the world
any way but straight on.

1:40:04.438 --> 1:40:06.098
And once she discovered

1:40:06.198 --> 1:40:08.698
there was nothing to hold back
or disguise,

1:40:08.798 --> 1:40:11.298
shone so brightly people
find themselves blinking

1:40:11.398 --> 1:40:13.298
when they first meet her.

1:40:13.398 --> 1:40:15.417
Like so many others
of my generation

1:40:15.517 --> 1:40:16.537
and perhaps yours too,

1:40:16.637 --> 1:40:19.857
I saw lies and I wanted truths.

1:40:19.957 --> 1:40:22.777
I didn't even know who I was
till music told me.

1:40:22.877 --> 1:40:26.237
I thought I was alone
until I heard the other voices.

1:40:27.757 --> 1:40:29.837
Helen's voice was one of those.

1:40:36.157 --> 1:40:38.977
I used to read Lillian's liner
notes over and over again

1:40:39.077 --> 1:40:40.777
when I was a little girl

1:40:40.877 --> 1:40:45.357
because they told me everything
about the woman I wanted to be.

1:40:51.557 --> 1:40:53.557
Sorry.

1:40:58.317 --> 1:41:00.397
You've made me cry.

1:41:08.597 --> 1:41:11.837
Alright. Where is this rally?

1:41:13.917 --> 1:41:15.657
- It's in Washington.
- Washington?

1:41:15.757 --> 1:41:18.397
Of course it's in Washington.

1:41:20.597 --> 1:41:22.597
I really love you.

1:41:23.556 --> 1:41:25.556
I love you too, Mom.

1:41:47.756 --> 1:41:49.056
You don't think I'm...

1:41:49.156 --> 1:41:52.496
You don't think I'm making
a mistake, do you?

1:41:52.596 --> 1:41:54.596
You're going to be great.

1:41:55.876 --> 1:41:57.856
And the people say,

1:41:57.956 --> 1:41:59.616
"We believe in choice.

1:41:59.716 --> 1:42:01.656
"We believe in liberty.

1:42:01.756 --> 1:42:04.216
"And we will never be denied."

1:42:10.796 --> 1:42:15.536
We say to the political
leadership of this country

1:42:15.636 --> 1:42:18.256
and to the Supreme Court

1:42:18.356 --> 1:42:21.496
and particularly
to the President,

1:42:21.596 --> 1:42:24.256
"We will not go back."

1:42:27.756 --> 1:42:29.756
Whoooo!

1:42:32.595 --> 1:42:36.575
Our next guest is
particularly special to me.

1:42:36.675 --> 1:42:40.255
When I heard her song
it changed my life,

1:42:40.355 --> 1:42:42.655
as I know it did
for many of you

1:42:42.755 --> 1:42:46.015
so it gives me great pleasure
to introduce

1:42:46.115 --> 1:42:49.695
the woman who gave our movement
an anthem,

1:42:49.795 --> 1:42:52.815
who gave us a voice -
Helen Reddy!

1:42:52.915 --> 1:42:54.415
I'm so proud of you.

1:42:57.115 --> 1:42:59.115
Thank you.

1:43:50.674 --> 1:43:54.774
If you know the words, I hope
you'll sing them along with me.
