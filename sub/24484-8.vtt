WEBVTT

00:40.416 --> 00:42.418
-Good morning.
-Step back, please.

00:42.460 --> 00:43.794
We're looking
for this gentleman

00:43.836 --> 00:46.297
and this gentleman only
for today.

00:46.338 --> 00:49.091
-So if you cooperate, we'll...
-

00:50.968 --> 00:52.261
Gracias.

00:52.303 --> 00:54.138
Now you're all going
to have to show

00:54.180 --> 00:55.931
-some identification.
-

00:55.973 --> 00:58.142
Let's go!

00:58.184 --> 01:01.270
Alberto Bondigas,
you're under arrest.

01:01.312 --> 01:03.481
Turn around.
Let's go. Take him.

01:11.071 --> 01:14.283
I got Russians-- Sberbank--
to guarantee the loan.

01:14.325 --> 01:16.327
I'm just looking
for a 30-day bridge.

01:16.368 --> 01:18.579
No, sanctions are a formality,
window dressing.

01:18.621 --> 01:21.123
This is a no-risk,
no-brainer for you.

01:34.345 --> 01:36.347
- -

01:43.270 --> 01:47.650
Must be a reason Sheehan's case
hasn't been filed yet.

01:47.691 --> 01:50.861
-Just trying to get it right,
Mank. -Yeah, I know.

01:50.903 --> 01:53.322
I mean, just gonna have
to cut him loose

01:53.364 --> 01:55.741
-end of watch if you don't.
-Like I said.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.660
I know. I'm just...

02:13.717 --> 02:16.679
Come on out. This way.

02:17.721 --> 02:19.473
Thanks for coming in early.

02:19.515 --> 02:20.891
Need a word.

02:20.933 --> 02:23.018
Let's talk out here.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.900
Sheehan's OIS, 2012,

02:29.942 --> 02:31.610
what's your thinking on that?

02:31.652 --> 02:33.195
Wasn't my investigation.

02:33.237 --> 02:34.738
What happened to the bullets?

02:34.780 --> 02:36.115
I wouldn't know.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.616
So you didn't notice

02:37.658 --> 02:39.493
the bullets were missing
from evidence?

02:39.535 --> 02:41.996
I've never even seen
the evidence for that case.

02:42.037 --> 02:43.330
You sure?

02:44.582 --> 02:46.750
Bosch, y... you want
to explain to me...

02:46.792 --> 02:49.587
-You were the last officer
to check it out. -No.

02:49.628 --> 02:51.547
Sounds like you were.

02:51.589 --> 02:53.132
What's going on?

02:53.173 --> 02:54.884
Property sign-out sheet

02:54.925 --> 02:56.844
shows you examined the evidence,

02:56.886 --> 02:58.929
Tuesday around 1300 hours.

02:58.971 --> 03:00.890
Sign-out sheet's wrong.

03:00.931 --> 03:03.726
-How so?
-I wasn't there.

03:05.269 --> 03:08.689
-The fuck are you accusing
me of? -Not accusing you.

03:08.731 --> 03:11.108
Just trying to get a handle
on what everyone's been doing.

03:11.150 --> 03:12.943
Someone signed my name.

03:12.985 --> 03:15.154
Check the thumbprint--
it won't be mine.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.322
Or the surveillance footage.

03:16.363 --> 03:17.865
I sure as hell will.

03:17.907 --> 03:19.158
What footage?

03:20.492 --> 03:22.411
Yeah.

03:22.453 --> 03:25.205
Defeats the purpose
if everyone knows about it.

03:25.247 --> 03:28.542
They put a camera in property
after Rampart.

03:28.584 --> 03:30.794
But thanks
for calling me a liar.

03:30.836 --> 03:33.047
Hold up, Snyder.

03:33.088 --> 03:35.424
Keep this between us.

03:36.467 --> 03:38.218
Yeah.

04:13.379 --> 04:16.048
- -

04:16.090 --> 04:17.341
- -

04:21.512 --> 04:22.763
- -

04:45.160 --> 04:48.288
Besides Sergeant Snyder,
who's been made aware of this?

04:48.330 --> 04:50.708
Lieutenant Billets,
when she signed the report.

04:53.544 --> 04:56.171
Where are we on filing Elias?

04:56.213 --> 04:58.090
Getting there.

04:58.132 --> 05:00.884
Feels like you're pulling an
entirely new thread with this.

05:00.926 --> 05:03.721
Not sure what I got yet.

05:03.762 --> 05:06.849
Another compromised cop.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.851
Who else could it be, Detective?
Last I checked,

05:08.892 --> 05:10.936
property doesn't sign out
evidence to civilians.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.813
No, sir, they don't.

05:15.441 --> 05:17.651
You're not telling me
everything.

05:17.693 --> 05:19.528
Keep it that way.

05:26.452 --> 05:29.371
Get the footage.
Close this case.

05:30.372 --> 05:32.374
Thank you, Chief.

05:36.754 --> 05:38.881
-Young Wash.
-

05:44.887 --> 05:47.139
Site visits this morning,
all divisions.

05:47.181 --> 05:48.807
Start with the Valley.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.142
Central, West, then South.

05:50.184 --> 05:51.643
I'll let the deputy chiefs know.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.645
No. No,
I'd rather it be a surprise.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.314
Keep everybody on their toes.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.107
Word travels fast.

05:57.149 --> 05:58.567
Drive faster.

05:58.609 --> 06:00.527
Meet me on P-one.

06:04.198 --> 06:06.825
Right in front of the station.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.952
Robertson and Pierce.

06:08.994 --> 06:10.662
They okay?

06:10.704 --> 06:12.831
Yeah.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.375
Billets put us on tac alert.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.753
What's that

06:17.795 --> 06:20.756
But the boys can still stay at
your place this weekend, right?

06:20.798 --> 06:22.341
Why can't we live together

06:22.382 --> 06:23.801
in one house?

06:23.842 --> 06:26.887
Yeah. We don't need two houses.

06:26.929 --> 06:28.764
You're here all the time anyway.

06:28.806 --> 06:30.432
-Jack.
-Joe started it.

06:30.474 --> 06:32.059
Dad's moving in?

06:32.101 --> 06:33.519
He's not moving anywhere.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.438
Yet.

06:37.523 --> 06:40.943
Mom bus leaves in five minutes.

06:42.319 --> 06:44.446
We'll figure it out.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.991
So keep your head on a swivel

06:48.033 --> 06:49.868
and your nose
out of your cell phone.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.704
We'll be on modified tac alert
until further notice.

06:52.746 --> 06:56.250
But remember,
we are not at war with the city.

06:56.291 --> 06:58.544
They're at war with us.

06:58.585 --> 07:01.755
No. Do not take this personally.

07:01.797 --> 07:03.382
Animals tried to burn us down.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.800
-Mm-hmm.
-But didn't.

07:04.842 --> 07:07.302
All eyes are on us now.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.596
So do your jobs, do them right,

07:09.638 --> 07:11.849
everybody goes home tonight.

07:17.729 --> 07:19.148
Didn't see who threw
the firebomb,

07:19.189 --> 07:21.441
but this one gets out
and he gives chase.

07:21.483 --> 07:23.318
P-two Dog instincts die hard.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.529
The guy they caught
still insisting he didn't do it?

07:25.571 --> 07:26.738
Claims he was never there.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.115
Might be something
on surveillance.

07:28.157 --> 07:29.783
Crims collected glass
from the bottle,

07:29.825 --> 07:31.201
see if they can raise prints.

07:31.243 --> 07:33.036
Other guy had to have help
getting away.

07:33.078 --> 07:34.746
-He just vanished.
-Tip of the iceberg.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.874
This was not two lone wolves.

07:36.915 --> 07:39.293
Might get a break
from social media.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.003
Loose lips,
incriminating chatter.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.754
Whack jobs with an ax to grind

07:42.796 --> 07:45.090
glom on to any protest,
peaceful or otherwise.

07:45.132 --> 07:48.969
Or a rogue copper pissed off
at you guys about Sheehan.

07:49.011 --> 07:51.930
Like someone in RHD.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.016
What else do you guys
need from us?

07:54.057 --> 07:57.019
That should do it. Just gonna
poke around a bit more out here.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.313
All right.
You're the arson guys.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.775
Bosch.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.444
Bennett.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.654
Hey, I'm so sorry about...

08:07.696 --> 08:09.656
Yeah, thanks.

08:09.698 --> 08:11.909
You in?

08:11.950 --> 08:13.952
Alberto Bondigas.
Our POI from River Watch.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.495
Right, right, right, right.

08:15.537 --> 08:17.122
Chief Irving said he'd tell you.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.457
Both been busy.

08:18.498 --> 08:22.169
Construction worker,
bragging about a fire for hire.

08:22.211 --> 08:23.629
I want to be there
for the interview.

08:23.670 --> 08:24.880
That's why I came over.

08:24.922 --> 08:26.256
Soon as we hook him up,

08:26.298 --> 08:28.800
-I'll give you a shout.
-Appreciate it.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.990
- -Come in.

08:55.077 --> 08:57.621
Hey. How'd it go
with the surveillance footage?

08:57.663 --> 08:59.248
Need me to expedite anything?

08:59.289 --> 09:02.042
-No. Walked it over myself.
-Oh.

09:02.084 --> 09:04.503
-Mind if I look at that in here?
-Sure.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.506
I don't know which is worse--

09:07.547 --> 09:09.549
that the department
installed surveillance

09:09.591 --> 09:12.469
in the property room,
or that they needed to.

09:12.511 --> 09:14.596
Oh.

09:14.638 --> 09:16.640
This came to Eleanor's.

09:16.682 --> 09:19.184
Maddie dropped it in the trash.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.749
Whoa, isn't that...?

09:42.791 --> 09:44.334
Yeah.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.005
I haven't worn
my Class A's since...

09:48.046 --> 09:49.798
wife before last.

09:49.840 --> 09:54.845
I opened that suit carrier, and
a host of Tineola bisselliella

09:54.886 --> 09:57.639
-just swarmed out of there.
-Clothing moths.

09:57.681 --> 09:59.766
Yeah, my pants are in tatters

09:59.808 --> 10:02.853
in the bottom of that bag.

10:02.894 --> 10:03.937
Edgar.

10:03.979 --> 10:05.480
Hey.

10:05.522 --> 10:07.316
Those are nice sweats.

10:07.357 --> 10:08.942
I hope no one

10:08.984 --> 10:10.694
writes you up
for not having your boots.

10:10.736 --> 10:13.655
It's not the clothes,
it's the man.

10:13.697 --> 10:17.367
-I don't see a problem.
-And if anyone does...

10:17.409 --> 10:19.995
-they can go fuck themselves.
-Mm.

10:22.456 --> 10:24.041
Up the roof.

10:24.082 --> 10:27.210
No Lincoln or Snyder.

10:27.252 --> 10:29.796
Morning.

10:29.838 --> 10:31.798
Sydney's school assembly
ran over.

10:31.840 --> 10:34.051
Oh, her solo blew me away.

10:34.092 --> 10:36.094
Well, glad I rushed
to get in here.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.429
Where is everybody?

10:37.471 --> 10:39.765
They don't tell me shit, Gabby.

10:39.806 --> 10:42.726
Yeah, well,
we're almost out of here.

10:42.768 --> 10:45.270
Back to setting our own hours.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.647
I have to run an errand.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.735
Someone needs me,
I'm on my cell.

10:51.777 --> 10:53.111
You all right?

10:55.405 --> 10:57.407
She swapped out the bullet
from Elias

10:57.449 --> 10:59.242
so it would match Sheehan's gun.

10:59.284 --> 11:01.912
-Why?
-Payback, maybe.

11:01.953 --> 11:04.331
I mean, Sheehan got over
on Lincoln and IA

11:04.373 --> 11:05.791
for Black Guardian.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.876
She wants to make sure
he goes down for Elias.

11:07.918 --> 11:09.544
Eh, that's a long drive,
brother.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.797
-You gonna question her?
-She'll deny it.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.507
She didn't notice, the bullets
were already missing.

11:13.548 --> 11:15.092
Yeah, we need to box her in.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.968
Yeah, fucks up Elias but good.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.261
Not Sheehan.

11:18.303 --> 11:20.180
Sure looks like he's innocent.

11:20.222 --> 11:22.307
Now we need the slug
that killed the operator.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.393
I'm on it.
Unless you need me here.

11:24.434 --> 11:25.811
No. Go to.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.729
There's a video, Jimmy.

11:27.771 --> 11:28.980
What?

11:29.022 --> 11:31.233
From the junkyard bathroom.

11:31.274 --> 11:33.860
Pretty confident it shows
the torture of Michael Harris.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.695
Micro SD chip.

11:35.737 --> 11:39.408
Elias kept it secret, was gonna
drop it on the world at trial.

11:39.449 --> 11:41.410
Well, thanks for sharing.

11:41.451 --> 11:42.994
Haven't had the chance.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.330
The Special Master
give this to you yesterday?

11:45.372 --> 11:49.418
No. Just a very strong theory
that it exists.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.086
Fuck.

11:51.128 --> 11:52.629
Could be anywhere.

11:52.671 --> 11:54.673
No, we stay on Lincoln,
but no one else can know

11:54.714 --> 11:56.508
that we're looking at her--
we play this close.

11:56.550 --> 11:58.301
Pull her package,
run her financials.

11:58.343 --> 11:59.636
With her sitting right there?

11:59.678 --> 12:01.513
I can get her out of the office,

12:01.555 --> 12:03.723
but until we know
where loyalties lie,

12:03.765 --> 12:06.560
we keep her partner in the dark.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.481
Hey. Where's Snyder?

12:11.523 --> 12:14.818
Running some errand.
You can call her.

12:14.860 --> 12:17.404
- -Need something?

12:17.446 --> 12:19.197
You two in the Valley
getting statements

12:19.239 --> 12:21.199
from Sheehan's
friends and neighbors.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.993
I thought you got those already.

12:23.034 --> 12:25.328
That was before ballistics
came back.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.205
-New development.
-We need to do them again.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.748
Have Snyder meet you there.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.711
Right. On my way.

12:36.506 --> 12:38.049
Hey, Mads.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.427
Dad.
-Everything okay?

12:40.469 --> 12:42.637
I wish people would
stop asking me that.

12:42.679 --> 12:44.639
Every time I call doesn't mean
something's wrong.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.766
Sorry.
Seems like a fair question

12:46.808 --> 12:49.186
since you're supposed
to be in class. Are you?

12:49.227 --> 12:52.856
Mr. Detective...
no, I'm not.

12:52.898 --> 12:54.900
What's up?

12:54.941 --> 12:58.528
I just thought I'd let you know
I might be home late tonight.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.071
Okay. Where you going?

13:00.113 --> 13:02.699
Drive around, clear my head.

13:02.741 --> 13:04.618
How late?

13:04.659 --> 13:06.745
Dad.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.748
Okay. Okay. Call me

13:09.789 --> 13:11.249
00.

13:11.291 --> 13:14.169
-Thanks.
-Yep. Love you.

13:14.211 --> 13:16.838
I know.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.357
Here's the Delgado material.

13:35.398 --> 13:37.901
Thank you.
I've asked IA to send over

13:37.943 --> 13:39.945
packages on the other
assistant chiefs as well,

13:39.986 --> 13:42.405
so, as soon as you have them?

13:48.328 --> 13:50.997
Jerry, that log of Sheehan's
phone calls over there?

13:53.667 --> 13:55.710
Looks like e-mails.

13:55.752 --> 13:58.046
Oh, need those, too.

14:00.966 --> 14:02.801
Edgar.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.553
Yeah, hold on.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.972
Harry, coroner's office,
line one.

14:09.474 --> 14:11.851
This is Bosch.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.359
Cremation.

14:19.401 --> 14:21.653
She left instructions.

14:21.695 --> 14:24.072
Any places you could recommend?

14:29.369 --> 14:31.788
Uh-huh.

14:36.293 --> 14:38.712
3-2-8-9.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.507
I'll make the arrangements.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.718
Yeah. Thanks.

14:59.399 --> 15:03.111
People saying you all found
the cop that did it.

15:03.153 --> 15:05.989
Still collecting evidence.

15:06.031 --> 15:08.450
What you looking for?

15:09.701 --> 15:12.537
Bullet
that killed Lanny Johnson.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.914
Oh, man.

15:14.956 --> 15:17.751
You know, about time
somebody said his name.

15:17.792 --> 15:20.211
Lanny was good people.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.380
And like he didn't matter.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.841
Everybody matters.

15:26.635 --> 15:29.179
I haven't seen nothing
like a bullet up here.

15:31.014 --> 15:33.433
It's down there.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.896
Somewhere.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.743
Lincoln's TEAMS report,
per your request.

15:51.785 --> 15:54.412
-She is squeaky clean.
-IA lifer.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.289
I mean, a couple
of minor citizen complaints

15:56.331 --> 15:58.041
from patrol days,
but nothing since.

15:58.083 --> 15:59.626
Any intersect with Sheehan?

15:59.668 --> 16:02.045
Besides IA's investigation
of Black Guardian.

16:02.087 --> 16:03.755
They both work out of PAB,

16:03.797 --> 16:05.715
but they're about eight years
apart in the academy.

16:05.757 --> 16:07.509
I mean, there's nothing
in there to suggest

16:07.550 --> 16:09.302
they've met anywhere
but across an interview table.

16:09.344 --> 16:12.514
Let me know
if I can get you anything else.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.474
-Thanks, L.T.
-Yup.

16:14.516 --> 16:17.811
Phone calls, e-mails.

16:17.852 --> 16:19.979
I'm not seeing
a connection, either.

16:20.021 --> 16:22.816
On Lincoln's end

16:22.857 --> 16:25.318
Divorced twice,
one daughter-- Sydney.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.237
No overlap with Sheehan's kid
on the school front.

16:27.278 --> 16:29.114
I asked Satriano
to run her financials.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.783
Has another favor ahead of mine.
Said he'd circle back

16:31.825 --> 16:34.786
-as soon as he could.
-15 years on the job,

16:34.828 --> 16:36.955
no connection to Sheehan, and...

16:36.996 --> 16:39.165
no reason to risk her career
by framing him.

16:39.207 --> 16:41.543
Well,
unless she's protecting herself.

16:42.794 --> 16:44.462
Lincoln killed Elias?

16:44.504 --> 16:45.797
Or knows who did.

16:45.839 --> 16:47.757
Black Guardian again.

16:47.799 --> 16:50.552
They both wanted the same
thing-- bring down bad cops.

16:53.263 --> 16:55.807
-Back already?
-Didn't go.

16:57.642 --> 16:59.644
I opened an IA investigation

16:59.686 --> 17:02.355
to find out who forged
my signature at property.

17:02.397 --> 17:04.816
I saw the footage.

17:04.858 --> 17:07.068
Shit. Tell anyone else?

17:07.110 --> 17:08.903
Judge May signed the warrant,
and Satriano

17:08.945 --> 17:10.613
in commercial crimes did

17:10.655 --> 17:14.033
a financial workup
on Gabriela on the down low.

17:14.075 --> 17:16.119
A favor.

17:16.161 --> 17:17.871
He won't say anything.

17:17.912 --> 17:19.372
Guess we know who's got pull.

17:19.414 --> 17:21.916
Two years ago,

17:21.958 --> 17:24.377
Gabriela opened a joint account
with Sydney, her daughter.

17:24.419 --> 17:26.880
Only made two deposits.

17:26.921 --> 17:29.466
One for 12K, May 3, 2015,

17:29.507 --> 17:33.511
and then another for 50K,
November 3, 2016.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.722
Now I checked the dates

17:35.764 --> 17:37.891
and it's around the time Elias

17:37.932 --> 17:39.684
would've received
settlement payments

17:39.726 --> 17:42.479
on the cases against Officer
Prentis and Detective Beckett.

17:42.520 --> 17:43.938
Do you mind if I...?

17:43.980 --> 17:46.357
I got it.

17:50.612 --> 17:53.239
Hmm. She's right.

17:53.281 --> 17:55.325
Elias made settlement deposits

17:55.366 --> 17:59.746
end of April 2015
and October 2016.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.289
Lincoln did Elias.

18:01.331 --> 18:03.082
We can't say

18:03.124 --> 18:05.585
for certain the money
Lincoln deposited came from him.

18:05.627 --> 18:08.213
For years, rumor's been that
Elias had a squirrel in PAB,

18:08.254 --> 18:10.048
feeding him key information

18:10.089 --> 18:11.800
so the city would settle
out of court

18:11.841 --> 18:13.843
to bury big scandalous cases.

18:13.885 --> 18:16.012
This time, he's fed footage
of Black Guardian.

18:16.054 --> 18:18.097
Hidden camera we think

18:18.139 --> 18:20.391
your partner found
in the junkyard bathroom.

18:23.728 --> 18:26.481
And Gabriela gave it to Elias?

18:26.523 --> 18:29.192
Sold it to him...
for a piece of the action.

18:29.234 --> 18:32.111
Any idea where she was
last Friday night?

18:35.073 --> 18:36.991
Okay.

18:37.033 --> 18:39.619
We need to find out
if she has an alibi.

18:39.661 --> 18:42.038
- -Full workup.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.832
Search warrants for her cell,

18:43.873 --> 18:47.085
anything else that can helps us
establish a timeline for her.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.795
And get her gun.

18:48.837 --> 18:50.505
And get her in here
for questioning

18:50.547 --> 18:52.966
without her figuring out why.

19:07.063 --> 19:09.065
This is fucked.

19:09.107 --> 19:10.692
You did good work.

19:10.733 --> 19:13.361
On a lost cause.

19:13.403 --> 19:16.155
Guilt by association.

19:16.197 --> 19:17.866
You think my next partner
is gonna trust me

19:17.907 --> 19:19.868
after I helped
take down my last one?

19:19.909 --> 19:21.286
It depends on the partner.

19:22.495 --> 19:25.164
I don't know how you do it.

19:25.206 --> 19:28.418
I'll never make it off
Bosch's shitlist.

19:28.459 --> 19:30.837
He's had a lot come down on him.

19:32.463 --> 19:34.591
Some very good detectives
have made it on that list,

19:34.632 --> 19:36.050
one point or another.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.719
You?

19:37.760 --> 19:40.722
So, you didn't see any
of this coming with Lincoln?

19:40.763 --> 19:42.891
Shit, Jerry. No.

19:42.932 --> 19:44.559
Of course not.

19:44.601 --> 19:46.436
Jerry?

19:46.477 --> 19:48.771
Let's get soup.

19:48.813 --> 19:50.648
What you did,

19:50.690 --> 19:54.736
going the extra mile,
goes a long way with him.

19:54.777 --> 19:57.238
He'll never say that.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.324
That's why I did.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.941
-Gentlemen.
-LAPD.

23:19.982 --> 23:21.859
Detectives Bosch and Edgar.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.653
Card game.

23:23.694 --> 23:26.447
Ken Lin said you let him
play here last Friday night?

23:26.489 --> 23:29.617
Ken Lin. Your cousin.

23:29.659 --> 23:31.911
From the mainland?

23:33.371 --> 23:34.997
Let me show you our kitchen.

23:35.039 --> 23:37.583
Please. Please.

23:49.053 --> 23:51.347
What is it you want from me?

23:51.389 --> 23:53.099
Whatever you can tell us.

23:53.141 --> 23:54.934
Chinese national.

23:54.976 --> 23:56.936
He was at your cousin's game.

23:56.978 --> 23:58.479
What would you like me to say?

23:58.521 --> 24:00.940
Start with what
you told the Feds.

24:04.277 --> 24:05.945
I don't know him.

24:05.987 --> 24:07.947
I've only seen him once.

24:07.989 --> 24:10.283
Hope to God
I never see him again.

24:10.324 --> 24:12.034
Your cousin knows him,
works for him.

24:12.076 --> 24:13.578
My cousin's back in China.

24:13.619 --> 24:16.289
-We're not close.
-Mystery man have a name?

24:17.498 --> 24:20.251
Ken called him Shiwei Chen.

24:20.293 --> 24:21.836
Heard he got violent.

24:21.878 --> 24:25.631
We're looking for his L.A.
intersect, other family,

24:25.673 --> 24:27.675
friends he might reach out to.

24:27.717 --> 24:30.052
-Family?
-Yeah.

24:30.094 --> 24:33.723
You've put my family in danger
just by coming here.

24:36.976 --> 24:39.145
-Harry!
-Please!

24:43.149 --> 24:45.526
If you think of something.

24:50.239 --> 24:52.783
We've all got family.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.623
You all right?

24:58.664 --> 25:01.209
Yeah. Sorry. I blew my top.

25:01.250 --> 25:04.003
No apology needed.
He wasn't gonna call.

25:04.045 --> 25:05.463
Not in this life.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.131
Fat cats in the back?

25:07.173 --> 25:08.633
Asian OGs.

25:08.674 --> 25:11.302
Probably got that guy
paying protection tax.

25:11.344 --> 25:13.221
The cousin and this Chen.

25:13.262 --> 25:15.681
Overseas connect
to some local op

25:15.723 --> 25:17.516
the Feds and Eleanor were onto.

25:17.558 --> 25:18.893
Chinese national looked

25:18.935 --> 25:20.603
to local soldiers
to do his wet work.

25:20.645 --> 25:22.897
Yeah, let's reach out
to San Gabriel gang unit.

25:25.316 --> 25:26.943
Hey, Jimmy. What's up?

25:26.984 --> 25:28.402
We got the warrants on Lincoln.

25:28.444 --> 25:30.488
Ready for the judge
on your say-so.

25:30.529 --> 25:31.781
Okay. We're heading in.

25:31.822 --> 25:32.949
And Snyder and I

25:32.990 --> 25:34.200
have an idea
about how we can get

25:34.242 --> 25:36.285
Lincoln talking.

26:32.133 --> 26:34.635
This is Detective Jerry Edgar
at Hollywood Station.

26:34.677 --> 26:37.096
I'd like to leave word
for Detective Moy.

26:37.138 --> 26:39.140
Have him call me
as soon as he can.

26:41.559 --> 26:42.935
Jackpot.

26:42.977 --> 26:44.895
Prints came back
on Clifton Campbell.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.939
Seven times.

26:46.981 --> 26:49.066
-No.
-Mm-hmm.

26:49.108 --> 26:51.193
Pull 'em up.

26:55.239 --> 26:57.616
The fuck?

26:57.658 --> 26:59.785
You said Frankie
wanted to talk to me.

26:59.827 --> 27:02.913
I'm sure he does, but we want
to talk to you first.

27:02.955 --> 27:05.541
-Well, I got nothing for you.
-Hey.

27:05.583 --> 27:07.626
We got something for you.

27:07.668 --> 27:09.754
Sheehan didn't kill Elias.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.130
And Bosch is the only one

27:11.172 --> 27:12.381
who believed him
from the get-go.

27:12.423 --> 27:13.591
Someone swapped out

27:13.632 --> 27:15.301
the bullet at the coroner's.

27:15.343 --> 27:17.345
Another cop.

27:18.429 --> 27:19.889
-Bullshit.
-Hear us out.

27:19.930 --> 27:21.766
So why is he still in custody?

27:21.807 --> 27:23.934
We need to bring this individual
in for questioning.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.853
Get an admission on tape.

27:25.895 --> 27:27.897
Clear Francis?

27:27.938 --> 27:29.940
Of Elias.

27:31.901 --> 27:34.070
-If this is some fucking ruse...
-Look, Rooker.

27:34.111 --> 27:35.613
Help us, help your partner.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.656
Otherwise,
take it on the arches.

27:40.159 --> 27:42.828
All right.

27:42.870 --> 27:44.997
What do you need me to do?

27:45.039 --> 27:48.209
Stolen property.

27:48.250 --> 27:50.127
Assault with a gun.

27:50.169 --> 27:51.712
Murder.

27:51.754 --> 27:53.631
Suspect wearing a hat,

27:53.672 --> 27:55.049
riding a bicycle.

27:55.091 --> 27:57.176
Son of a bitch.

27:57.218 --> 27:59.845
We solved the Koreatown Killer.

28:03.974 --> 28:05.393
-Yeah.
-Dude, tenth floor

28:05.434 --> 28:07.895
kicked this to the bulls
for, like, six months.

28:07.937 --> 28:10.272
Took us, what? Two days.

28:10.314 --> 28:12.566
Zen masters.

30:16.440 --> 30:18.442
Got you.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.530
Got you.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.702
Sergeant Lincoln speaking.

30:28.744 --> 30:29.954
It's Bosch.

30:29.995 --> 30:31.372
This was a total waste of time.

30:31.413 --> 30:33.123
Snyder couldn't make it
out here.

30:33.165 --> 30:35.459
The neighbors
didn't want to talk. I'm done.

30:35.501 --> 30:37.503
Don't worry about it.

30:37.545 --> 30:39.672
How soon can you get back here?

30:39.713 --> 30:42.132
I was on my way home.

30:42.174 --> 30:43.676
What's going on?

30:43.717 --> 30:45.761
Think maybe Rooker
could have been with Sheehan

30:45.803 --> 30:47.263
when he pulled the trigger.

30:48.347 --> 30:50.266
Thought his alibi checked out.

30:50.307 --> 30:52.226
Didn't hold.

30:52.268 --> 30:54.812
Pierce went over
the security cam footage again.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.939
Rooker was on the corner of 4th

30:56.981 --> 30:59.817
below Angels Flight,

30:59.858 --> 31:02.027
time frame of Elias' murder,

31:02.069 --> 31:04.154
near where I found
the watch and wallet.

31:04.196 --> 31:07.992
Rondell's a relentless
son of a bitch.

31:08.033 --> 31:10.244
We need to get Rooker in here,
get him talking.

31:10.286 --> 31:12.079
Good luck with that.

31:12.121 --> 31:13.622
He pretty much hates you, Bosch.

31:13.664 --> 31:15.082
That's why I need you to do it.

31:15.124 --> 31:18.335
That man's got no love
for IA, either.

31:18.377 --> 31:19.837
Yeah,
but you've been besting cops

31:19.878 --> 31:21.338
for the last ten years.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.799
11, actually.

31:23.841 --> 31:25.551
Now that's an asset?

31:25.593 --> 31:28.762
Okay, fine.
I'll ask Snyder to do it.

31:32.808 --> 31:34.643
No.

31:34.685 --> 31:36.103
I'll square up my child care

31:36.145 --> 31:38.230
-and see you
in about 40 minutes. -Thanks.

31:53.746 --> 31:55.456
-Oh, none for me.
-Oh, no, leave it.

31:55.497 --> 31:56.624
He picks.

31:58.667 --> 32:00.377
People are saying

32:00.419 --> 32:03.881
that this could be like '92.

32:03.922 --> 32:06.175
The city's changed.

32:06.216 --> 32:08.093
The media's fanning the flames.

32:08.135 --> 32:09.678
You're not at all worried?

32:09.720 --> 32:12.473
I'm more concerned
about what happens after.

32:12.514 --> 32:16.435
Riot or not, the mayor's gonna
hang my department out to dry.

32:16.477 --> 32:18.729
-How?
-

32:18.771 --> 32:21.523
His citizen review panel.

32:21.565 --> 32:24.109
An implicit validation
of Sunday's protest

32:24.151 --> 32:25.944
and an indictment
of my rank and file.

32:25.986 --> 32:28.530
The obvious political play.

32:28.572 --> 32:31.200
And anything I try to counter
with now will be overshadowed

32:31.241 --> 32:34.119
by the narrative that a cop
murdered Howard Elias.

32:34.161 --> 32:36.664
Your reorganization
of the command staff.

32:36.705 --> 32:39.166
Delgado...

32:39.208 --> 32:40.793
Nestor Delgado.

32:40.834 --> 32:43.754
Among others.

32:43.796 --> 32:45.714
I think you should just let
Mayor Ramos do

32:45.756 --> 32:47.341
what he's gonna do.

32:47.383 --> 32:49.343
What, use me as a punching bag?

32:49.385 --> 32:51.470
Rope-a-dope.

32:51.512 --> 32:54.098
When it all dies down,

32:54.139 --> 32:55.641
you'll have your plan ready.

32:55.683 --> 32:58.352
You know about rope-a-dope?

32:58.394 --> 33:01.063
Yeah. Float like a butterfly.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.028
It's what
I've been thinking, too.

33:09.071 --> 33:11.031
Appear to be responding swiftly

33:11.073 --> 33:12.366
to what the public needs...

33:12.408 --> 33:15.411
..but, in fact,
implementing the changes

33:15.452 --> 33:17.621
that you intended to make
all along.

33:19.665 --> 33:22.543
Still a few loose ends
to tie up.

33:22.584 --> 33:25.087
A cop in a cage

33:25.129 --> 33:26.672
is a real morale killer, Harry.

33:26.714 --> 33:29.466
-You gonna charge our friend
in there or what? -I...

33:29.508 --> 33:30.884
Still time left.

33:30.926 --> 33:33.721
-Hey. He here?
-Booking.

33:33.762 --> 33:36.306
No camera
in the jail interview room.

33:36.348 --> 33:37.891
Gonna need to bring
your own recorder.

33:37.933 --> 33:40.769
Jail

33:40.811 --> 33:43.313
I'll fill you in.
Go check your weapon.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.357
Be right back.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.776
Wait till Sheehan sees him.

34:28.817 --> 34:30.360
Mank, give us some audio.

34:30.402 --> 34:33.363
Rooker! Rooker!

34:33.405 --> 34:35.032
Rook!

34:36.450 --> 34:38.035
Rooker!

34:38.076 --> 34:40.078
What's going on, guys?

34:41.789 --> 34:43.248
Rook.

34:46.835 --> 34:48.629
Robertson, talk to me. Come on.

34:48.670 --> 34:50.839
Robertson, fucking talk to me!

34:50.881 --> 34:53.550
Come on!

34:53.592 --> 34:55.719
Okay.

34:55.761 --> 34:57.763
Let's do this.

35:09.525 --> 35:12.194
Bosch. What the fuck's
going on here?

35:12.236 --> 35:13.654
Bosch!

35:13.695 --> 35:15.656
Come on, man, talk to me.

35:15.697 --> 35:17.574
What's Rook doing here?

35:19.034 --> 35:20.994
Get a sitter for your daughter?

35:21.036 --> 35:24.039
My ex. Lousy husband,

35:24.081 --> 35:25.332
but he's a pretty good dad.

35:25.374 --> 35:26.500
Your partner got any upside?

35:26.542 --> 35:29.002
Jesus. Jerry, let it slide.

35:29.044 --> 35:30.462
Something happen with Amy?

35:30.504 --> 35:34.007
Wasted half the day
signing out evidence

35:34.049 --> 35:36.134
-from Sheehan's old
officer-involved shooting. -Why?

35:36.176 --> 35:37.302
You weren't with her?

35:37.344 --> 35:39.054
Me?

35:39.096 --> 35:40.848
No. When?

35:40.889 --> 35:42.182
Tuesday.

35:42.224 --> 35:45.394
I had the credit union
warrant and the coroner.

35:47.020 --> 35:48.021
Maybe she just wanted
to check the evidence

35:48.063 --> 35:49.106
against something from the file.

35:49.147 --> 35:52.067
See? What I said.

35:52.109 --> 35:54.403
Amy's ambitious.

35:54.444 --> 35:56.697
Me? I like it where I'm at.

35:56.738 --> 35:58.782
Why you're here and she's not.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.534
You ask her about it?

36:00.576 --> 36:02.160
It's not worth
the time it would take.

36:03.662 --> 36:06.456
I'll go see
if Rooker's lawyer showed up.

36:13.755 --> 36:15.757
He's in a mood.

36:15.799 --> 36:17.551
So what are we working with?

36:17.593 --> 36:19.386
Besides the bad alibi?

36:19.428 --> 36:22.055
Pretty sure Elias
had surveillance footage

36:22.097 --> 36:23.974
proves Sheehan
did Black Guardian.

36:24.016 --> 36:25.851
Impossible.

36:25.893 --> 36:27.561
I saw every inch
of that footage.

36:27.603 --> 36:31.023
Special master said Elias
was gonna drop a video at trial

36:31.064 --> 36:32.858
to impeach RHD.

36:32.900 --> 36:34.359
Could be Rooker
went with Sheehan

36:34.401 --> 36:36.111
to get the tape back from Elias,

36:36.153 --> 36:37.654
shit went sideways.

36:37.696 --> 36:40.365
Jesus.

36:40.407 --> 36:43.201
Well, how did Elias
get ahold of it?

36:43.243 --> 36:46.705
Well, RHD collected the cameras
on the day, right?

36:47.748 --> 36:51.168
So, Pipes, Fix, Drake.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.837
Take your pick.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.797
Well, it's got
to be Drake, right?

36:59.051 --> 37:00.552
What?

37:02.596 --> 37:05.349
Was it you or Snyder
that verified the cameras

37:05.390 --> 37:08.143
for the Harris complaint?

37:08.185 --> 37:10.187
I don't know. Why?

37:11.229 --> 37:13.273
The case report says it was you.

37:15.692 --> 37:17.110
Could have been.

37:17.152 --> 37:19.780
Or we went
to the junkyard together

37:19.821 --> 37:20.948
and I wrote it up.

37:20.989 --> 37:23.450
Five cameras.

37:23.492 --> 37:25.202
What does the report say?

37:25.243 --> 37:28.246
I, uh...

37:28.288 --> 37:30.749
I don't remember.

37:30.791 --> 37:34.252
Could you have found a camera
but didn't log it in?

37:36.254 --> 37:38.882
What does this have to do
with Rooker?

37:42.177 --> 37:45.639
Did you know there's a security
cam in the property room?

37:46.974 --> 37:49.393
Me neither.

37:49.434 --> 37:52.646
Everybody who comes and goes.

37:53.855 --> 37:56.274
Snyder's name is in the book.

37:56.316 --> 37:58.568
But you're on video.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.404
Tuesday.

38:00.445 --> 38:03.240
Walking in to swap out
the bullet,

38:03.281 --> 38:04.908
after the credit union,

38:04.950 --> 38:07.577
before the coroner's.

38:07.619 --> 38:10.080
There were no bullets
in that box.

38:10.122 --> 38:11.540
But why lie?

38:13.417 --> 38:15.002
Why use Snyder's name?

38:17.045 --> 38:18.380
Look...

38:20.882 --> 38:23.844
You were giving me
the grunt work.

38:23.885 --> 38:27.264
I thought... I just thought,
Sheehan's killed someone before.

38:27.305 --> 38:29.266
It might be helpful. It wasn't.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.727
Look, and I didn't want you up
my ass for taking initiative.

38:31.768 --> 38:33.186
Where the fuck is Rooker?

38:33.228 --> 38:35.022
Rooker has an alibi
for last Friday night.

38:35.063 --> 38:36.106
Do you?

38:37.524 --> 38:39.484
Wait.

38:39.526 --> 38:41.862
What is this?

38:41.903 --> 38:43.739
You know what this is.

38:43.780 --> 38:47.034
Hold on.

38:47.075 --> 38:49.870
I park my kid, drive all the way
back up here to help you,

38:49.911 --> 38:52.039
and now you're questioning me,
like I'm a suspect?

38:52.080 --> 38:53.874
You found a camera
in the junkyard bathroom.

38:53.915 --> 38:55.751
Sold the video to Elias.

38:55.792 --> 38:59.296
With the understanding
he wouldn't divulge his source,

38:59.337 --> 39:01.214
settle it out of court.

39:04.134 --> 39:06.511
You think I killed him.

39:06.553 --> 39:09.598
We have your bank statements.

39:09.639 --> 39:11.767
Deposits that line up with
other big Elias settlements.

39:14.728 --> 39:17.022
But he didn't settle this time.

39:18.065 --> 39:20.150
You were exposed.

39:20.192 --> 39:22.194
Source of the tape.

39:23.612 --> 39:26.615
I didn't sell anything
to Howard Elias.

39:27.949 --> 39:29.910
Someone else.

39:29.951 --> 39:32.913
You have no idea.

39:32.954 --> 39:35.749
Want me to talk?

39:35.791 --> 39:38.835
Bring in the DA.

39:38.877 --> 39:40.587
O'Shea's in Sacramento.

39:40.629 --> 39:42.255
Won't be back until morning.

39:42.297 --> 39:43.340
Okay.

39:43.381 --> 39:44.758
Let's book her, isolate her.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.259
Get our warrants,

39:46.301 --> 39:47.677
get her phone,

39:47.719 --> 39:50.263
get her gun to Firearms.

39:50.305 --> 39:53.433
Harry, Detective Moy
at San Gabriel called me back.

39:53.475 --> 39:55.268
-When can he meet us?
-Now.

39:55.310 --> 39:57.896
Give me five?

40:01.358 --> 40:03.360
- -

40:09.241 --> 40:11.076
Cleared you, Frank.

40:11.118 --> 40:13.078
Of this one.

40:13.120 --> 40:16.456
Bullet got swapped,
like you said.

40:20.502 --> 40:22.420
You know who did it?

40:22.462 --> 40:25.465
Still a lot of moving parts.

40:25.507 --> 40:27.592
Can you gut it out here
until morning?

40:29.136 --> 40:31.221
Word of your release gets out
on the street,

40:31.263 --> 40:33.849
you have a bull's-eye
on your back.

40:33.890 --> 40:36.726
Like I got anyplace else to go,
you know?

40:40.564 --> 40:43.108
Thank you, Harry.

40:48.572 --> 40:49.948
Okay, they may try to move us

40:49.990 --> 40:51.324
back from the gate on Wilcox,

40:51.366 --> 40:52.993
but there is a back entrance
over here

40:53.034 --> 40:54.828
where we could put people.

40:54.870 --> 40:57.998
If they close off De
Longpre, we'll need to be ready.

40:58.039 --> 41:00.333
'Cause our only way out
will be Fountain.

41:00.375 --> 41:03.503
-See?
-Yeah. -I like that.

41:03.545 --> 41:05.255
-Babe?
-Just a minute. I want...

41:05.297 --> 41:08.133
I just want to figure out
these escape routes.

41:16.975 --> 41:19.102
She looks so young.

41:20.896 --> 41:22.898
Yeah.

41:27.527 --> 41:30.447
Has Detective Sheehan
been charged?

41:30.488 --> 41:33.450
I'm not at liberty to discuss
an ongoing investigation.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.076
Then we have nothing
to talk about.

41:35.118 --> 41:36.661
But you want us to change.

41:36.703 --> 41:38.914
Or is that just an empty slogan?

41:38.955 --> 41:40.540
Not to me.

41:40.582 --> 41:42.334
I have a proposition for you.

41:44.002 --> 41:46.796
I'm not interested
in any backdoor deals with LAPD.

41:46.838 --> 41:48.757
There's a spot opening up
on the existing

41:48.798 --> 41:51.134
Los Angeles Police
Oversight Committee.

41:51.176 --> 41:53.637
Civilian reviewer.

41:53.678 --> 41:55.722
And you want it to be me?

41:55.764 --> 41:58.225
I should think
you would want it to be you.

41:58.266 --> 42:00.477
Because I care
about the community?

42:00.518 --> 42:01.728
No.

42:01.770 --> 42:04.564
Because you don't trust LAPD.

42:04.606 --> 42:07.442
Civilian reviewers
are surprisingly lenient

42:07.484 --> 42:10.070
when it comes
to officer misconduct.

42:10.111 --> 42:12.072
I don't want bad cops
in my ranks

42:12.113 --> 42:14.032
any more than you want them
in your neighborhood.

42:14.074 --> 42:16.034
I need someone
who won't be blinded.

42:17.577 --> 42:20.121
If you think
this is gonna make me call off

42:20.163 --> 42:22.207
-the protest...
-Your protest?

42:22.249 --> 42:25.418
You taking responsibility
for last night's firebomb?

42:26.461 --> 42:29.589
Two policemen almost got killed.

42:35.553 --> 42:37.013
Ms. Zealy,

42:37.055 --> 42:39.766
I'm showing you the forest.

42:39.808 --> 42:42.310
Stop staring at the trees.

42:50.944 --> 42:52.946
See you on Sunday.

43:08.920 --> 43:11.673
- -What the hell was that?

43:11.715 --> 43:14.676
After all the work
that we've done?

43:14.718 --> 43:16.344
We put our lives
on the line for you!

43:16.386 --> 43:17.929
Tell us what you were just doing

43:17.971 --> 43:19.514
-over there. -We put everything
on the line for you!

43:19.556 --> 43:21.516
-And you do this to us?
-Everything.

43:26.313 --> 43:28.440
Let's go. Take a seat.

43:49.169 --> 43:50.462
Detective Moy?

43:50.503 --> 43:52.213
Hollywood Edgar.

43:52.255 --> 43:54.591
Harry Bosch.

43:54.632 --> 43:56.217
Sorry for your loss.

43:56.259 --> 43:57.927
The picture you sent.
Shiwei Chen?

43:57.969 --> 44:00.013
Not tracking in my unit.

44:00.055 --> 44:01.514
Golden Soup?

44:01.556 --> 44:03.433
BBs own that part of town.

44:03.475 --> 44:06.186
Baby Bandit Boys.
Loose ties back to the mainland.

44:06.227 --> 44:09.189
-Murder for hire up their alley?
-If the price is right.

44:09.230 --> 44:12.359
I don't think money's a problem
for our Chinese national.

44:12.400 --> 44:14.778
We have some solid CIs
in BB territory.

44:14.819 --> 44:16.696
You got the time,
we can do a bar crawl tonight,

44:16.738 --> 44:18.907
start with my boy Ted
at this karaoke place.

44:18.948 --> 44:21.034
Show your picture around,
ask questions.

44:21.076 --> 44:22.535
My informants can circle back

44:22.577 --> 44:23.870
with what gets said
after we leave.

44:23.912 --> 44:24.871
Solid. Let's do it.

44:24.913 --> 44:26.289
Shake the tree, see what falls.

44:26.331 --> 44:27.874
Can't hurt.

44:37.675 --> 44:40.637
Detective Moy. San Gabriel PD.

44:40.678 --> 44:41.638
And you are?

44:41.679 --> 44:42.806
Teddy.

44:42.847 --> 44:45.392
Teddy, how you doing?

44:45.433 --> 44:47.644
Take a look at a picture for me.

44:47.685 --> 44:49.771
Nope.

44:49.813 --> 44:51.439
Take your time.

44:51.481 --> 44:52.857
Don't need time. Don't know him.

44:52.899 --> 44:55.151
Never seen him here,
there, anywhere.

44:55.193 --> 44:56.861
How about you?

45:01.658 --> 45:03.660
Who's here tonight, Teddy?

45:03.701 --> 45:06.204
Uh... two couples.

45:06.246 --> 45:07.622
Big party down the hall.

45:07.664 --> 45:08.873
We're gonna take a look around.

45:08.915 --> 45:10.917
-Why

45:10.959 --> 45:13.336
Want to talk to your customers--
that's why.

45:13.378 --> 45:15.130
What if they don't want
to talk to you?

45:15.171 --> 45:16.131
Free country.

45:16.172 --> 45:17.465
Let's let them decide.

45:17.507 --> 45:19.551
Man.

45:19.592 --> 45:21.261
Stay here.

45:35.650 --> 45:38.236
- -

45:38.278 --> 45:40.071
-

45:40.113 --> 45:41.865
- -

45:45.452 --> 45:47.579
- -

46:04.929 --> 46:06.639
Sorry for the intrusion.

46:06.681 --> 46:09.559
I'm Detective Moy,
from San Gabriel PD.

46:09.601 --> 46:11.978
These are Detectives Bosch
and Edgar. Gonna show you

46:12.020 --> 46:13.646
a photograph
of a man you may have seen.

46:13.688 --> 46:15.064
Anything you can tell us
about him

46:15.106 --> 46:17.400
would be greatly appreciated.

46:30.038 --> 46:32.499
-Gun! Get down!
-

46:35.418 --> 46:37.253
- -One down!

46:44.969 --> 46:47.138
- -

48:44.922 --> 48:48.134
Mom?
