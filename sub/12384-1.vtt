00:46.646 --> 00:50.582
The agency told you you had to pay
for your own uniforms, right?

00:50.683 --> 00:53.311
(Heavy accent)
Yes, I to buy with money from job.

00:53.420 --> 00:58.187
No, no, no. You can't start
a job without a uniform.

00:58.291 --> 01:01.920
But how to buy when not been paid?

01:02.028 --> 01:04.325
- You don't have any money?
- No.

01:04.431 --> 01:08.197
This is why I take job.
To make money.

01:08.301 --> 01:10.667
This is why I come to America.

01:10.770 --> 01:14.001
- To be big shoot.
- Shot. Big shot.

01:14.107 --> 01:19.977
I try not to live in past.
Only present tense since I come.

01:20.080 --> 01:24.813
(Chuckling)
Yeah, but big shoot makes no sense.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.886
This is the main building.

01:26.986 --> 01:31.923
Administration, lecture rooms
and the laboratories.

01:34.527 --> 01:36.427
It's just the floors in here.

01:36.529 --> 01:39.589
Don't worry about the cages
or what's in 'em.

01:39.699 --> 01:42.224
The research assistants feed them.

01:42.335 --> 01:44.633
You know, they study animal behavior.

01:44.737 --> 01:48.468
In cage,
only can behave like prisoner.

01:48.575 --> 01:52.636
Word of advice, my man.
Try not to think so much,

01:52.712 --> 01:55.647
and whatever you do,
don't bother the professors.

01:55.748 --> 01:58.546
They're the real big shoots
around here.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.055
Watch your step.

02:10.363 --> 02:12.923
(Sighing)

02:13.032 --> 02:16.331
This is purgatory.

02:17.804 --> 02:20.204
I'll get the trash.

02:22.208 --> 02:25.905
(Snoring)

02:39.559 --> 02:41.459
What bird kind is this?

02:41.561 --> 02:43.222
(Snorts) Huh?

02:43.329 --> 02:45.923
The biting kind. Be careful.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.365
(Growls)

02:50.370 --> 02:52.270
Are you bird or dog?

02:53.940 --> 02:57.068
What... What he's doing down here?

02:57.177 --> 03:00.169
Paulie's an old project
for Dr. Reingold.

03:00.280 --> 03:03.807
Didn't work out. Loss of funding
or something. I can't remember.

03:03.917 --> 03:08.752
But he's not eat, I think,
and he lose his feather.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.289
Don't worry about him.

03:11.357 --> 03:13.985
Come on. I'll show you
where the incinerator is.

03:28.675 --> 03:30.643
(Singing)

03:42.555 --> 03:44.955
(Singing continues)

03:53.866 --> 03:55.834
(Buffer starts)

04:14.287 --> 04:16.721
(Singing)

04:27.934 --> 04:32.928
# I loved you
the first time I saw you

04:35.174 --> 04:39.042
# I always will love you

04:39.145 --> 04:41.045
# Marie #

04:49.188 --> 04:51.816
You made me your fairy godmother.

04:51.924 --> 04:57.419
So if I'm your fairy godmother,
I command you to go to sleep.

04:57.530 --> 04:59.760
You gotta go to sleep, Marie.

04:59.866 --> 05:04.326
Look, I'll be right here.

05:04.437 --> 05:07.338
Good night, Marie. I love you, too.

05:09.175 --> 05:11.439
OK, I'll see you in the morning.

05:16.883 --> 05:19.977
- (Yelling)
- Hey, who are you?

05:20.086 --> 05:22.077
What are you doing down here?
Get outta here!

05:22.188 --> 05:26.488
Come on! Leave me alone!
And don't come back!

05:26.592 --> 05:30.926
Virgil. First, he's singing.
Now he's talking.

05:31.030 --> 05:32.998
Quit messing with that parrot

05:33.066 --> 05:35.432
and get back to work
before you get us both fired.

06:00.293 --> 06:02.193
M.A.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.360
Hello.

06:12.438 --> 06:16.204
"Food consists of seeds,

06:16.309 --> 06:19.710
"nuts, bugs.

06:19.812 --> 06:23.612
"Flocks are seen feeding
in mango trees,

06:23.716 --> 06:26.378
"bearing ripe fruit."

06:26.486 --> 06:29.080
(Door opens)

06:36.462 --> 06:38.862
Mango.

06:53.980 --> 06:55.675
Muchas gracias.

07:18.371 --> 07:21.033
(Sighing) Let's see.

07:21.140 --> 07:23.472
What shall I have for lunch tonight?

07:25.244 --> 07:28.907
Now, here is some big banana,

07:29.015 --> 07:32.883
very plump papaya...

07:32.985 --> 07:37.786
and... some nice mango.

07:37.890 --> 07:41.826
Oh, yes, this is a good one.

07:41.928 --> 07:46.991
Nice and yellow on the inside.

07:50.837 --> 07:55.672
Oh, yes,
this going to taste delirious.

08:03.950 --> 08:06.009
You like mango, bird?

08:06.118 --> 08:09.087
Hmm? It's very juicy...

08:09.188 --> 08:12.487
and good for growing feathers.

08:12.592 --> 08:16.028
Want a bite? Hmm?

08:18.130 --> 08:20.291
Say "mango".

08:25.137 --> 08:27.435
Mango.

08:41.888 --> 08:45.153
Mmm. Oh, this good.

08:45.258 --> 08:47.317
Mmm.

08:47.426 --> 08:49.826
All right. Mango, mango, mango.

08:49.929 --> 08:52.955
M-a-n-g-o. Mango.
Are you happy now?

08:53.065 --> 08:55.329
(Gasps and coughs)

08:55.434 --> 08:57.334
Oh, my God.

08:57.436 --> 09:01.805
This is what you've reduced me to.
I've sold out for a piece of fruit.

09:01.908 --> 09:05.639
(Gasping)
I can't believe it. You can talk?

09:05.745 --> 09:08.976
Believe it, Tolstoy, but don't
forget the fruit, the mango.

09:09.081 --> 09:12.573
Give it to me, you mop monkey.

09:12.685 --> 09:14.585
- Oh.
- Bird?

09:14.687 --> 09:16.587
(Bird) Oh, my Lord.

09:16.689 --> 09:21.251
What your name is, bird?
Talk to me, bird.

09:22.595 --> 09:24.825
Bird.

09:24.931 --> 09:27.058
The, uh, skin test...

09:27.133 --> 09:30.591
- Excuse me, you are Dr. Reingold?
- Yes, I am.

09:30.670 --> 09:32.695
- I am Misha Belenkoff.
- Hello.

09:32.805 --> 09:36.741
- I have to ask you about a parrot.
- Parrot?

09:36.842 --> 09:41.142
The one in the...
down in-in-in dungeon.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.147
Maybe is wrong word. Uh...

09:43.249 --> 09:45.649
- There is a bird down there.
- Mm-hmm.

09:45.751 --> 09:47.651
A green parrot.

09:47.753 --> 09:50.051
Oh, the little conure.
Yeah. Is he still with us?

09:50.156 --> 09:53.785
Yes, I come to tell you,
with great amazement,

09:53.893 --> 09:56.225
he can talk.

09:56.329 --> 10:00.231
- No, he mimics.
- Mimics? What is "mimics"?

10:00.333 --> 10:02.392
He repeats what he hears.
He does not talk.

10:02.501 --> 10:06.870
No, he understand.
He's intelligent, Doctor.

10:06.973 --> 10:08.702
I know...

10:08.774 --> 10:10.799
I appreciate your concern, Mister...

10:10.910 --> 10:12.810
- Belenkoff.
- Belenkoff.

10:12.912 --> 10:16.245
But, well, you see these people?

10:16.349 --> 10:19.841
This is what they do.
And this is what I do.

10:19.952 --> 10:23.319
Don't you think if we had an animal
with that kind of intelligence,

10:23.389 --> 10:25.050
somebody would have noticed?

10:25.157 --> 10:30.390
I know parrot talk. He sing song.

10:30.496 --> 10:34.728
He understand speech.
He even insult me.

10:34.834 --> 10:39.066
- He call me mop monkey.
- (Laughing)

10:39.171 --> 10:41.332
He talk.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.908
I can prove you to it.

10:46.278 --> 10:49.679
Would you like some mango?

10:51.083 --> 10:54.143
(Misha) Mango.

10:59.225 --> 11:01.523
(Growls)

11:03.729 --> 11:05.629
(Dr. Reingold) Speak.

11:05.731 --> 11:07.995
(Squawks)

11:08.100 --> 11:11.831
- Speak.
- (Squawks)

11:16.876 --> 11:19.401
No, please, listen, sir.

11:19.512 --> 11:23.642
Maybe if I explain better.
If I say...

11:23.749 --> 11:28.083
I think you've said enough.
Let us do our job and you do yours.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.348
Like, maybe, pick up the trash.

11:46.338 --> 11:49.273
Great. Now we're both in trouble.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.502
What is problem with you?

11:51.610 --> 11:54.909
You know,
maybe they should stuff you,

11:55.014 --> 11:59.417
scoop you out, fill you with foam
and glue you to fake tree.

12:12.998 --> 12:17.401
You're lonely, I think. I am lonely.

12:17.503 --> 12:21.064
In Russia,
I was teacher of literature.

12:21.173 --> 12:25.166
In America,
I am cleaner of bird crap.

12:28.280 --> 12:31.408
I miss words.

12:31.517 --> 12:35.317
I miss my language.

12:35.421 --> 12:40.120
I just would like someone to talk to.

12:40.226 --> 12:44.128
- Join the club.
- What?

12:44.230 --> 12:46.528
I said, join the club.

12:46.632 --> 12:51.035
So I'm not crazy. You CAN talk.

12:51.137 --> 12:54.368
- Of course I can talk.
- Then why you not?

12:54.473 --> 12:57.101
Because talking
just gets you into trouble.

12:57.209 --> 13:00.804
- Trouble? Why you say that?
- It's a long story.

13:00.913 --> 13:03.643
I'm Russian.

13:03.749 --> 13:06.274
I like long stories.

13:06.385 --> 13:09.479
All right, Chekhov. Sit down.

13:11.290 --> 13:14.487
(Sighing) It all started with Marie.

13:14.593 --> 13:16.527
The one in the song.

13:17.396 --> 13:20.058
Yeah. The one in the song.

13:21.667 --> 13:23.999
(Indistinct talk)

13:24.069 --> 13:25.798
(Woman) Marie!

13:25.905 --> 13:28.669
Marie, come see
what your grandpa brought you.

13:38.317 --> 13:42.651
- (Stuttering) G-G-Grandpa!
- My beautiful girl.

13:42.755 --> 13:46.316
W-What d-did you bring me?

13:46.425 --> 13:48.325
Look in the basket, sweetie.

13:48.427 --> 13:52.056
(Paulie) 'I opened my eyes,
and there she was.'

13:53.933 --> 13:56.163
B-Bird.

13:56.268 --> 13:58.168
(Squawking)

14:03.375 --> 14:06.776
(Paulie) 'I didn't know what this
creature was, but I liked it.'

14:06.879 --> 14:10.110
I thought I'd give her someone
to talk to. I named him Paulie.

14:10.216 --> 14:13.117
Pretty P-Paulie.

14:14.553 --> 14:17.147
(Paulie) 'Pretty Marie.'

14:20.326 --> 14:22.886
You w-w-want some?

14:30.469 --> 14:34.565
Just mix a little in there, OK?

14:34.673 --> 14:36.573
O-OK.

14:38.344 --> 14:40.574
G-Go down.

14:47.286 --> 14:50.881
D-D-Do y-you like this?

14:52.992 --> 14:55.017
G-G-Good.

14:55.127 --> 14:58.028
G-G-Good boy.

14:59.698 --> 15:02.189
(Chattering)

15:02.301 --> 15:04.360
Marie, can you help Mommy?

15:04.470 --> 15:07.837
This goes on the glass tray.
This goes in the star bowl, OK?

15:07.940 --> 15:11.205
(Background music) # Lonely days
are gone, I'm a-goin' home

15:11.310 --> 15:14.837
# My baby just wrote me a letter

15:14.947 --> 15:18.314
# I don't care how much money
I got with me

15:18.417 --> 15:20.510
# I got to get back to my baby... #

15:20.619 --> 15:22.519
(Mom) Hey, Jerry,
did you get something to drink?

15:22.621 --> 15:25.784
- Here you go, guys.
- Oh, that's great. Thanks.

15:27.259 --> 15:29.557
Marie, can you get that bird
off the table?

15:30.696 --> 15:32.129
Marie.

15:32.231 --> 15:36.258
- Paulie's h-helping me.
- He's helping you. I know. I know.

15:36.368 --> 15:39.769
Why don't you two go outside and play
until Daddy gets here?

15:40.873 --> 15:43.637
Y-Y-Y-You like that?

15:44.743 --> 15:46.870
Wait t-t-t-till Daddy sees you.

15:49.315 --> 15:52.079
(Cheering)

16:05.864 --> 16:08.492
There she is. There she is.

16:12.171 --> 16:14.298
She's growin'. Hi, Bunny.

16:15.874 --> 16:20.902
- How's my big girl?
- Say hello to your daddy, Marie.

16:23.315 --> 16:26.682
Handshake first, kiss later, OK?

16:34.893 --> 16:37.919
Ooh, that's a strong handshake.

16:39.631 --> 16:42.862
- (Squawking)
- Hey.

16:43.936 --> 16:46.496
When did we get a bird?

16:49.608 --> 16:52.873
G-G-Grandpa g-got him for me.

16:52.978 --> 16:56.709
H-H-His n-name is Paulie.

17:05.290 --> 17:07.884
(Music box)

17:10.462 --> 17:13.863
P-Paulie w-wants a kiss, too.

17:13.965 --> 17:16.627
OK.

17:20.071 --> 17:23.906
# I loved you the first time

17:24.009 --> 17:29.140
# I saw you

17:29.248 --> 17:32.809
# And I always...
will love you, Marie #

17:39.992 --> 17:41.892
Good night.

17:49.535 --> 17:50.866
(Door slams)

17:50.936 --> 17:53.905
(Dad) I just cannot believe
you didn't tell me.

17:54.440 --> 17:58.433
(Mom) I wanted to write you.

17:58.544 --> 18:02.412
- Well, then, why didn't you?
- I didn't know what to say.

18:02.448 --> 18:04.712
Is she getting any better?
Is it going away?

18:04.817 --> 18:07.718
No, but it won't go away if you
put too much pressure on her.

18:07.820 --> 18:10.084
I don't think
you put enough pressure on her.

18:10.155 --> 18:13.181
I can't stand to see her suffer.
I can't stand it!

18:13.292 --> 18:17.319
What happens when she goes to school?
Do you think she'll be made fun of?

18:17.396 --> 18:20.957
Because I can guarantee you
that she will be.

18:21.066 --> 18:23.296
You tell me.
What do you think we should do?

18:23.402 --> 18:27.805
I just think all this "we love you
whatever you do" is not gonna help.

18:29.708 --> 18:35.112
Great, great. We'll just order
her to stop stuttering? Is that it?

18:43.155 --> 18:46.124
OK, y-y-you are
the fairy godmother,

18:46.225 --> 18:48.250
a-a-and I a-am the princess.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.453
We live in a big castle,

18:50.562 --> 18:54.157
a-a-a-and I have
lots of princess dresses.

18:55.901 --> 18:59.234
OK, fairy godmother,
m-make me talk right.

18:59.338 --> 19:01.169
(Door slams)

19:03.208 --> 19:08.942
A-A-A-A-And p-p-p-please hurry.

19:09.047 --> 19:13.507
All right, Marie. Let's take
your time. There's no hurry, OK?

19:13.619 --> 19:16.019
This is a?

19:19.958 --> 19:22.256
But-ter-fly.

19:25.197 --> 19:29.031
(Chuckles) Ball.

19:36.141 --> 19:40.043
Um, I'll tell you what.

19:40.145 --> 19:43.205
I'll let you take
these cards with you,

19:43.315 --> 19:47.012
and maybe you'll feel more
comfortable practicing at home.

19:50.556 --> 19:52.854
OK, relax.

19:52.958 --> 19:56.189
Take a deep breath.

19:56.295 --> 19:58.320
Let it out slowly.

20:02.334 --> 20:04.359
Now say "house".

20:04.469 --> 20:08.496
H-H-H...

20:08.607 --> 20:12.737
- House, sweetie, house.
- Hey, how are my girls?

20:12.844 --> 20:14.778
Good.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.780
- How's it goin'?
- Good. Very good.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.782
Good.

20:20.052 --> 20:23.988
What are you workin' on?
Cup. That's right.

20:24.089 --> 20:26.649
- Come on. You can say "cup".
- C-C-C...

20:26.758 --> 20:30.319
That's right, baby. You can do
it. Look at me. Watch me. Cup.

20:30.429 --> 20:34.832
C-C-C-C...

20:34.933 --> 20:36.662
Cup.

20:36.768 --> 20:41.364
Lila, just let her say it.
Why don't you just let her say it?

20:42.975 --> 20:46.536
Look, I'm sorry. You keep
saying it for her. Let her say it.

20:46.612 --> 20:48.910
I'm doing my best!

20:48.981 --> 20:52.542
They told you to say the word?
I don't think so. Let her say it.

20:52.618 --> 20:55.917
Am I supposed to leave
her there totally frustrated?

20:55.988 --> 20:58.582
Cup.

20:58.657 --> 21:01.182
- (Dad) Just let her say the word.
- Cup.

21:02.661 --> 21:05.152
C-up.

21:05.697 --> 21:07.597
Cup.

21:10.035 --> 21:12.230
C-Cup.

21:16.708 --> 21:19.472
You did it, Marie. You did it!

21:19.544 --> 21:22.035
(Paulie) 'All it took was one word
and they shut up.

21:24.650 --> 21:26.083
'I wanted to learn more.'

21:26.184 --> 21:28.414
- What's that?
- Ch-Ch-Chair.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.454
That's a chair. Give me some of that.

21:30.555 --> 21:32.648
- F-F-Fence.
- Fence.

21:32.758 --> 21:34.726
Fl-Flower.

21:34.826 --> 21:36.726
- What about this?
- R-Rock.

21:36.828 --> 21:38.989
Rock. What are those?

21:39.097 --> 21:42.225
- Ew, bugs.
- Don't mind if I do. (Chuckles)

21:43.302 --> 21:45.236
I'm going to the store.
Wanna take a ride with me?

21:45.337 --> 21:49.068
N-N-No. Paulie i-i-is helping me...

21:49.174 --> 21:51.574
learn some new words.

21:53.545 --> 21:58.915
No, Bunny, birds don't talk,
and they don't teach, OK?

21:59.017 --> 22:02.111
They just repeat what we say.
They don't understand.

22:02.220 --> 22:05.246
P-P-Paulie understands.

22:10.362 --> 22:12.455
Pretty quiet, aren't you there,
Professor?

22:12.564 --> 22:16.056
I was quiet. I'm sorry I was,
but I was afraid of him.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.466
And that's not all I was afraid of.

22:18.570 --> 22:20.663
Come on. Birds fly.

22:20.772 --> 22:23.104
You were afraid to fly?

22:23.208 --> 22:25.267
I was afraid of heights.

22:25.377 --> 22:28.710
- Until I learned a new word.
- What?

22:28.814 --> 22:31.510
- (Gasping)
- What?

22:31.616 --> 22:32.913
No, no, no...

22:32.984 --> 22:34.815
(Paulie)
'I had no idea what it was.'

22:34.886 --> 22:36.319
Bad idea. Very bad.

22:36.421 --> 22:41.324
(Paulie) 'But something told me
it was hazardous to my health.'

22:41.426 --> 22:44.657
I see claws and teeth and eyes.
And claws and teeth and eyes.

22:44.763 --> 22:47.891
The claws! Look at those claws.

22:47.999 --> 22:50.763
(Paulie) 'So this flea bag
got run of the place,

22:50.869 --> 22:53.337
'and was allowed
to hang out on the couch

22:53.405 --> 22:55.600
'where me and Marie used to watch TV.

22:55.707 --> 22:59.165
'I was banished to
this very uncomfortable coat rack,

22:59.244 --> 23:00.939
'which they called a "perch".'

23:01.012 --> 23:02.980
(Meowing)

23:06.017 --> 23:08.212
- (Meowing)
- Hey, kitty, kitty.

23:13.959 --> 23:17.053
(Paulie) 'And so began
a lifelong trend of speaking,

23:17.162 --> 23:20.359
'when I should've
kept my big beak shut.'

23:20.465 --> 23:23.559
(Paulie) Here, kitty, kitty.
Come on outside.

23:23.668 --> 23:26.535
Come on. We've got some shrimps
on the barbecue for ya.

23:26.638 --> 23:29.402
Right heres. No. Keep... Hey.

23:29.508 --> 23:33.444
Turn around and go outside, you
stupid hair ball. They're calling.

23:33.545 --> 23:36.912
Go on. That's it. Go outside, Muffy
or Pumpkin, or duh...

23:37.015 --> 23:38.915
I don't even know your name.

23:39.017 --> 23:44.045
Uh, go, uh, go dig something up
or bury something.

23:44.156 --> 23:46.681
Why are you coming towards me?
No, you...

23:46.792 --> 23:49.090
That's not good. You don't wanna
be on the furniture.

23:49.194 --> 23:51.628
It doesn't match your coat.
(Chuckles) Get down. Get down.

23:51.730 --> 23:55.393
Get down from the furniture.
Get down. You don't even like salad.

23:55.500 --> 23:56.899
That's...

23:58.003 --> 24:01.200
- Ah! Look out!
- (Meowing)

24:04.075 --> 24:07.476
Come on. Leave me alone, cat!
(Laughing)

24:07.579 --> 24:10.548
I wasn't laughing at you.
Come on. Leave me alone.

24:10.649 --> 24:13.083
- (Hissing)
- Stop!

24:13.185 --> 24:17.713
- Stop it, you bad cat!
- Stupid hair ball.

24:17.823 --> 24:19.313
- Shoo!
- Yeah, shoo!

24:19.825 --> 24:22.589
I don't think she can
tell the difference

24:22.694 --> 24:24.662
between fantasy and reality.

24:24.729 --> 24:27.323
Come on.

24:27.432 --> 24:31.232
You know what she said?
Are you ready for this?

24:31.336 --> 24:34.134
She said the bird told her
the cat started it.

24:34.239 --> 24:36.639
- (Lila) She said that to you?
- Yeah.

24:36.741 --> 24:39.403
Well, she's five years old.
It's her imaginary friend.

24:39.511 --> 24:41.945
I don't know.

24:42.047 --> 24:44.572
She doesn't have any other friends.

24:44.649 --> 24:47.277
She hasn't made
any other attachments.

24:47.385 --> 24:49.353
I just...

24:49.454 --> 24:53.515
I really think that we should
consider getting rid of the bird.

24:53.625 --> 24:57.618
I don't know, Warren.
She loves that bird.

24:57.729 --> 25:00.630
She loves that bird.

25:08.707 --> 25:11.039
(Paulie) Now where we goin'?

25:11.142 --> 25:13.440
You have to learn how to fly, Paulie.

25:13.545 --> 25:15.945
No, I don't want to.

25:17.048 --> 25:20.506
- You h-have to.
- Why?

25:20.585 --> 25:24.214
So in case you ever go away,
y-you can fly back to me.

25:24.322 --> 25:28.315
- Away?
- We h-have to be together, r-right?

25:28.426 --> 25:30.826
- Right.
- Then f-fly.

25:33.231 --> 25:36.962
(Groaning) Oh. You again.

25:38.470 --> 25:41.701
Come on, Paulie. D-Don't look down.

25:41.806 --> 25:45.742
Look at the stars.
N-Now spread your wings.

25:45.810 --> 25:46.868
OK.

25:46.978 --> 25:49.173
Don't look down. You could do it.

25:49.281 --> 25:52.182
If it's so easy, why don't you do it?

25:52.284 --> 25:56.084
- OK, I'll show you.
- All right, come on.

26:00.659 --> 26:02.320
Hey, good shot. You almost got him.

26:05.964 --> 26:07.864
Anything?

26:10.835 --> 26:12.735
Wow.

26:17.275 --> 26:22.838
OK, now spread your wings.
D-Don't look down.

26:22.948 --> 26:27.408
OK, ready? One, two, fly!

26:27.519 --> 26:30.784
Come on. Now, fly. Come on, fly.

26:30.889 --> 26:34.620
Whoa, Marie. Look out!

26:34.726 --> 26:37.695
- Marie! Help us, somebody!
- Help!

26:37.796 --> 26:40.287
It's Marie! Help!

26:40.398 --> 26:43.390
(Marie screaming)

26:43.501 --> 26:46.937
- Oh, baby.
- My God.

26:47.038 --> 26:49.370
(Warren) Are you OK?

26:49.474 --> 26:51.442
(Marie crying)

26:51.543 --> 26:55.980
(Paulie) 'Marie couldn't talk.
The dad couldn't listen.

26:56.081 --> 26:58.106
'The mom couldn't cope.

26:58.216 --> 27:00.582
'So they got rid of me.'

27:07.258 --> 27:09.123
(Marie) Paulie!

27:09.227 --> 27:10.990
(Paulie) Marie.

27:11.096 --> 27:12.393
- Paulie!
- Marie.

27:12.464 --> 27:13.931
Marie, come back.

27:14.032 --> 27:16.592
- Paulie!
- Marie!

27:16.701 --> 27:18.931
- Paulie!
- Marie!

27:20.538 --> 27:23.098
Paulie!

27:23.208 --> 27:26.109
(Sobbing) Fly back to me!

27:27.646 --> 27:31.343
Paulie!

27:31.449 --> 27:35.783
Paulie, I love you! Fly back to me!

27:35.887 --> 27:40.620
(Marie sobbing)
Fly back to me, Paulie!

27:41.726 --> 27:43.853
So they bring you here?

27:43.962 --> 27:47.363
Nah, no. It wasn't that easy
hitting rock bottom.

27:47.465 --> 27:49.262
I did a bunch of things.

27:49.334 --> 27:51.768
First, I did a stint
as a window display

27:51.870 --> 27:54.270
in a place called Bloomingdale's.

27:54.372 --> 27:57.102
And I was in a brochure
for Costa Rica.

27:57.208 --> 28:00.609
I did some work as a magician's
assistant doing children's parties,

28:00.712 --> 28:02.475
but when Zintar fell on hard times,

28:02.547 --> 28:04.606
he had to choose
between me and the cape.

28:04.716 --> 28:06.741
Guess which one he pawned.

28:06.851 --> 28:11.117
# What's new, pussycat,
whoa, whoa, whoa #

28:11.990 --> 28:15.050
Shut up, you goddamn flying rat,
shut up.

28:15.160 --> 28:18.027
# Pussycat, pussycat,
you are delicious

28:18.129 --> 28:20.757
# And if my wishes
could all come... #

28:20.832 --> 28:24.598
May you're uncomfortable in there?
Maybe you need a change.

28:24.669 --> 28:27.661
How about this nice toaster oven
for top brown only?

28:27.772 --> 28:30.536
Come on, Artie.
We haven't pawned anything all day.

28:30.642 --> 28:33.406
Let's catch the number nine
at Belmont. I'm bored.

28:33.511 --> 28:36.878
- You and me both.
- I wanna go home.

28:36.981 --> 28:38.380
Get on line.

28:38.450 --> 28:42.386
Yo, Artie, today is your lucky day.

28:42.487 --> 28:46.150
Right. Fresh outta the showroom,
right? Where's the receipt?

28:46.257 --> 28:48.657
- Lost it.
- Ten bucks.

28:48.760 --> 28:50.387
Ten bucks? Come on, gimme a break.

28:50.495 --> 28:52.986
I'm trying to upgrade
the level of your merchandise.

28:53.064 --> 28:55.157
(Paulie) Hit the brakes, ugly.

28:55.233 --> 28:58.430
Cute. Do you train the bird
to insult your customers?

28:58.536 --> 29:02.199
No, I could tell you're ugly
all by myself.

29:02.273 --> 29:05.709
- How'd he do that?
- He watches television.

29:07.278 --> 29:09.508
What an angle.

29:09.614 --> 29:12.674
I could see how his unique skills
could really...

29:12.784 --> 29:15.685
come in handy
to an intelligent guy, huh?

29:15.787 --> 29:18.722
(Paulie) Yeah, I'll let you know
when I see one.

29:18.823 --> 29:21.121
How much you want for him, Artie?

29:21.226 --> 29:23.285
A lot more than ten bucks, baby.

29:23.394 --> 29:27.125
You'd have to grift for more
than a year to make his numbers.

29:27.232 --> 29:29.200
OK, which of you three
is the proprietor?

29:29.300 --> 29:32.235
Very funny, toots.
What do you got there?

29:32.337 --> 29:35.932
Oh, this is my easel.
It's a very fine one.

29:36.040 --> 29:38.304
My late husband got it for me,

29:38.409 --> 29:40.969
and I really hate to part with it,
you know?

29:41.045 --> 29:47.245
Yeah, whatever. Dead husband aside,
do you wanna pawn or sell?

29:47.352 --> 29:49.149
Well...

29:49.254 --> 29:50.812
The real question is,

29:50.889 --> 29:54.052
are you prepared to throw in
that potholder on your head?

29:56.327 --> 30:01.560
Well, that was extremely rude.

30:01.666 --> 30:03.566
Did you teach him that?

30:03.668 --> 30:06.136
No. That's the thing.
The dirty mouth is all his.

30:07.906 --> 30:10.340
What are you looking at?

30:12.043 --> 30:15.240
You know,
I think I'll take him with me.

30:15.346 --> 30:18.645
Well, I don't think so, lady.
See, I saw the bird first.

30:18.750 --> 30:22.277
Oh, no, no. I'm afraid you are not
the right owner for him.

30:22.387 --> 30:25.948
Somebody has to teach
this beautiful bird some manners.

30:26.057 --> 30:27.649
Might as well be me.

30:27.759 --> 30:31.024
What's wrong with my manners? (Burps)

30:31.129 --> 30:34.587
(Paulie) All right.
Let me out now, Grandma.

30:34.699 --> 30:38.658
- Very funny. Let me go. Joke's over.
- Hey, stop that.

30:38.736 --> 30:41.603
Keep it up
and you'll be in a cage yourself.

30:41.706 --> 30:43.606
- Come on, would you let me out?
- Hush.

30:43.708 --> 30:47.508
Padre, you see this broad?
She's a birdnapper. Let me out!

30:47.579 --> 30:51.811
Somebody check this lady's purse.
I bet she's got a hamster in there.

30:51.916 --> 30:53.816
- Get out. Scram.
- Thank you. Jeez.

30:53.918 --> 30:55.818
- Where are you going?
- Home.

30:55.920 --> 30:58.150
- Are you gonna walk all the way?
- That's right.

30:58.256 --> 31:00.781
Well, why don't you fly?
It's a lot faster.

31:00.892 --> 31:04.726
Can't fly.
# Cha, cha-cha-cha, cha... #

31:04.829 --> 31:08.788
You can talk, but you can't fly.
All right, see you around.

31:08.900 --> 31:11.130
All right. See ya.

31:11.236 --> 31:13.704
- (Bell ringing)
- (Squawking)

31:13.805 --> 31:15.966
(Humming)

31:16.074 --> 31:21.205
Uh, you know what?
I thought it over, and I'm back.

31:22.680 --> 31:24.671
Besides,
I don't know where she lives.

31:24.782 --> 31:27.808
- Where who lives?
- Marie.

31:27.886 --> 31:31.253
She's all alone,
and we're supposed to stick together.

31:34.759 --> 31:38.456
Do you think you could use
a little bit of help?

31:38.529 --> 31:39.689
Yes.

31:39.764 --> 31:43.791
- Yes, what?
- Yes, toots.

31:43.902 --> 31:47.531
- Mm, "yes, please".
- Man, you're needy.

31:47.639 --> 31:51.575
Alweather, Alweather, Alweath...
Alweather!

31:51.676 --> 31:56.443
Oh, are we in luck. There's
only one Alweather in this book,

31:56.547 --> 31:58.777
and it's pretty close by.

31:58.850 --> 32:01.444
What do you say we just go over
and surprise her?

32:05.290 --> 32:06.848
Recognize anything?

32:06.958 --> 32:09.449
That's it. That's the house.

32:09.560 --> 32:12.859
That's it, that's it, that's it.
That's the one!

32:17.535 --> 32:19.560
Oh, dear.

32:44.595 --> 32:49.123
I'm sorry, dear. They've moved away.

32:49.233 --> 32:52.828
- Away?
- Mm-hmm. To Los Angeles.

32:52.937 --> 32:56.304
All right, well,
let's get back in the cab, huh?

32:56.407 --> 33:01.071
Oh, no. It's clear across
the country. It's 3,000 miles.

33:01.179 --> 33:02.874
Please.

33:05.383 --> 33:09.911
I'm afraid "please"
just won't work in this situation.

33:11.422 --> 33:13.856
(Woman) But, what's the matter
with New Jersey?

33:14.692 --> 33:16.751
It's nice, if you give it a chance.

33:16.861 --> 33:18.761
(Thunderclap)

33:22.900 --> 33:24.800
Why does your house have wheels?

33:24.902 --> 33:27.370
Houses are cheaper with wheels.

33:27.472 --> 33:29.838
I was thinking more along the lines

33:29.907 --> 33:32.535
that houses with wheels
can go places.

33:32.643 --> 33:37.137
Well, not anymore, I'm afraid.

33:37.248 --> 33:41.480
Earl and I used to travel
all of the time, you know?

33:41.586 --> 33:43.884
But things change.

33:43.988 --> 33:48.015
He had even crazier ideas
than you have.

33:48.126 --> 33:51.960
We always used to talk about
going to the Grand Canyon,

33:52.063 --> 33:56.261
but we just never got that far.

33:56.367 --> 34:01.532
Earl said that if you stand right at
the edge just when the sun comes up,

34:01.639 --> 34:05.837
it's like seeing the first sunrise
in the whole world.

34:05.943 --> 34:09.708
- He was kind of poetic, wasn't he?
- For an ex-Marine.

34:09.813 --> 34:12.373
Hmm, you miss Earl.

34:12.483 --> 34:15.748
- Oh, let's not talk about that.
- You miss Earl.

34:15.853 --> 34:19.186
Eat your dinner.

34:19.290 --> 34:21.757
Like I miss Marie.

34:24.495 --> 34:26.395
(Sighs)

34:28.032 --> 34:30.556
- Ready?
- Ready!

34:30.668 --> 34:32.862
(Engine starts)

34:32.969 --> 34:36.531
- So long, Jersey!
- So long, Jersey!

34:36.641 --> 34:40.371
(Paulie chattering, whooping)

34:42.647 --> 34:46.583
(Paulie) 'I thought flying was scary
until I drove with Ivy.

34:46.684 --> 34:48.914
'Now, that's scary.'

34:49.020 --> 34:53.480
Ah, yes. You and I are right here,

34:53.591 --> 34:56.719
and Marie is right there.

34:56.828 --> 35:00.093
Right there. Well, not...
You know, not literally.

35:00.198 --> 35:04.066
This is a map - an atlas.
It's a book full of maps.

35:04.168 --> 35:05.931
I'll teach you about books.

35:06.003 --> 35:07.732
(Paulie) 'Ivy was a great teacher.

35:07.805 --> 35:09.898
'She was a philosopher, an explorer.

35:10.007 --> 35:13.170
'Unfortunately,
she also thought she was a singer.'

35:13.277 --> 35:16.246
# He has tramped upon the vintage
where the grapes of wrath are stored

35:16.347 --> 35:18.872
# He has loosed
the fateful lightning... #

35:18.983 --> 35:22.316
Please. I'm a bird. I have a small
brain, and it's about to explode.

35:22.420 --> 35:24.320
# His truth goes marching on #

35:24.388 --> 35:26.356
(Paulie) Let's try something
a little more classby.

35:26.457 --> 35:30.223
(Both) # What's new pussycat,
whoa, whoa, whoa

35:30.328 --> 35:36.699
# What's new pussycat,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

35:37.902 --> 35:41.394
# Pussycat, pussycat,
I've got flowers

35:41.506 --> 35:45.408
# And lots of hours
to spend with you

35:45.510 --> 35:49.002
# So go and powder
your cute little pussycat nose... #

35:49.113 --> 35:51.104
(Paulie)
So when will we get there?

35:51.182 --> 35:53.412
(Ivy)
Maybe that's the wrong question.

35:53.518 --> 35:55.452
Maybe we should be asking,

35:55.553 --> 35:58.920
"What are we gonna see
along the way?

35:59.023 --> 36:01.992
"What wrong turn are we gonna make...

36:02.093 --> 36:06.291
"that will take us
someplace unexpected?

36:07.732 --> 36:11.259
"Will the weather be for us,
or will it be against us?

36:11.369 --> 36:13.428
"Will we lose faith?

36:13.538 --> 36:17.702
"Will we get there, or won't we?"

36:17.808 --> 36:20.208
- You're scaring me.
- (Chuckling)

36:20.311 --> 36:23.303
It's good to be scared sometimes.

36:23.414 --> 36:25.405
Put your wings up.

36:27.818 --> 36:30.946
That's it. Very good.

36:31.055 --> 36:33.353
You should learn how to fly, Paulie.

36:33.457 --> 36:37.018
The last time someone suggested
that, it didn't work out so good.

36:37.128 --> 36:40.291
You're missing out on something
that's probably pretty great.

36:40.398 --> 36:43.299
Hey, why don't you try it
and let me know.

36:45.436 --> 36:48.462
- Are you tired?
- A little bit.

37:00.351 --> 37:04.185
(Paulie) The desert is fun.
What is the biggest desert?

37:04.255 --> 37:07.486
It's the North Pole. It doesn't
have to be hot to be a desert.

37:07.992 --> 37:09.983
It just has to not have rainfall.

37:10.061 --> 37:13.622
Could we stop at
the world's largest ball of twine?

37:13.698 --> 37:16.667
That'd probably be more
fun than Mount Rushmore.

37:16.767 --> 37:20.464
There's a truck up ahead.
Don't those guys ever get tired?

37:20.571 --> 37:22.937
Ivy, look out! Get outta the way!

37:25.243 --> 37:26.801
Oh!

37:36.387 --> 37:38.116
(Sighing) Oh.

37:46.631 --> 37:51.728
(Paulie) You know, maybe your
house shouldn't have wheels.

37:51.836 --> 37:53.895
Oh, dear.

37:54.005 --> 37:58.908
All right, all right.
I'll go get some help.

37:59.010 --> 38:02.844
You stay here. You know, it's...
Don't be frightened.

38:02.947 --> 38:04.847
Let's see.

38:15.793 --> 38:18.227
(Paulie) 'For all
of her pleases and thank yous,

38:18.329 --> 38:20.820
'words weren't
really that important to Ivy.

38:20.931 --> 38:23.195
'It's what she saw that mattered.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.895
'Seems to me, the way it works out,

38:26.003 --> 38:30.406
'it's the things you love most
that are the things they take away.'

38:33.144 --> 38:37.046
(Ivy) The doctor says
I really mustn't drive any more.

38:37.148 --> 38:39.878
You'll just have to
go ahead without me.

38:39.984 --> 38:45.251
Los Angeles is due west from here,
right into the setting sun.

38:45.356 --> 38:49.349
I can be your eyes.
I can watch the road for you.

38:49.460 --> 38:51.428
Besides, I can't go without you.

38:51.529 --> 38:55.431
Oh, of course you can.

38:58.035 --> 39:02.165
I'm not very good at good-byes, dear,
so I think you should go now.

39:02.273 --> 39:07.176
Just right now. And you send me
a postcard when you get there.

39:11.982 --> 39:14.746
(Ivy) Where did I put that comb?

39:29.500 --> 39:31.263
Oh.

39:35.206 --> 39:37.106
Thank you.

39:41.145 --> 39:44.046
(Paulie) 'And so I stayed.'

39:47.752 --> 39:49.743
(Ivy) We nearly home yet?

39:49.820 --> 39:52.948
(Paulie)
Go to your left here. There you go.

39:53.057 --> 39:58.222
You know what you are, Paulie?
You're my seeing-eye parrot.

40:02.733 --> 40:05.964
You've been a dear friend to me,
Paulie.

40:06.070 --> 40:08.402
We're birds of a feather, you and I.

40:08.506 --> 40:12.237
Betwixt and between, that's us.

40:12.343 --> 40:17.212
So what do we have tonight?
Is it pretty?

40:17.314 --> 40:19.214
Oh, very pretty.

40:19.316 --> 40:22.513
There's more orange now,
and it's getting darker.

40:22.586 --> 40:24.645
Just a little gold left.

40:24.755 --> 40:27.315
The sun must almost be set.

40:29.326 --> 40:32.124
- Can you see any stars yet?
- Not yet.

40:36.700 --> 40:39.692
(Paulie)
'And then one day, the cat got her.'

40:48.546 --> 40:50.446
Oh.

40:59.123 --> 41:01.421
(Paulie) 'There are
things in life you put off,

41:01.525 --> 41:03.493
'because you think
you're gonna do them later.

41:03.594 --> 41:05.619
'But the real thing Ivy taught me

41:05.696 --> 41:08.756
'is you gotta live
like there may not be a later.

43:03.247 --> 43:06.876
(Paulie) 'I found a tree,
and I spent the night.

43:17.995 --> 43:21.328
'Cos I wanted to be there
in the morning...

43:21.432 --> 43:24.993
'for the very first sunrise.'

43:40.584 --> 43:43.485
So, you flew all the way here?

43:43.587 --> 43:46.181
(Paulie) Yep, all the way.

43:46.290 --> 43:49.418
- Is long way to go by yourself.
- Tell me about it.

43:49.526 --> 43:51.756
So what you did next?

43:51.862 --> 43:55.195
Ivy introduced me
to a lot of wonderful things,

43:55.299 --> 43:58.860
but, you know, she left
one very important thing out.

44:00.471 --> 44:02.871
(Woman singing opera)

44:07.645 --> 44:09.545
(Yawns)

44:09.647 --> 44:11.547
(Singing continues)

44:21.959 --> 44:23.085
Hmm?

44:37.141 --> 44:40.235
(Bird giggling)

44:40.344 --> 44:42.744
(Laughing)

44:44.248 --> 44:46.375
(Female) Hola.

44:49.086 --> 44:52.578
Hi, I'm Paulie. Uh, Paul.

44:52.690 --> 44:54.817
Could you help me?
I'm a little lost.

44:54.925 --> 44:59.453
Me llamo Lupe.
Soy una pajara muy bonita.

44:59.563 --> 45:03.294
Huh? Uh, maybe we got off
to a bad start.

45:03.400 --> 45:07.461
Look, my name's Paulie, and I'm
a little lost. I need some help.

45:07.571 --> 45:11.268
Hey, wait. Where you going?
Hey, wait for me.

45:14.945 --> 45:19.279
# All my friends know the Low Rider #

45:19.416 --> 45:21.247
(Squawking)

45:21.351 --> 45:25.117
(Man) Hey, you guys, knock it off.
What are you doing? What's going on?

45:28.392 --> 45:30.292
Oh.

45:32.229 --> 45:34.197
Hey, you, come on down here.

45:34.298 --> 45:36.198
Yeah, you. Come on.

45:38.268 --> 45:41.203
OK, what's your story?

45:41.305 --> 45:44.638
Uh, yes. Uh, I'm looking for
someone named Marie Alweather.

45:44.742 --> 45:48.007
But I'm afraid I may be lost.
Can you tell me where I am?

45:52.015 --> 45:54.745
(Chuckles)

45:54.852 --> 45:58.151
You're in L.A. East L.A.

45:58.255 --> 46:02.055
L. A? L. A! Oh, my gosh, I made it!

46:02.159 --> 46:04.389
I made it! L. A! I don't believe it!

46:04.495 --> 46:08.898
I don't believe it. You can talk?

46:08.999 --> 46:11.297
They talk.

46:11.401 --> 46:13.301
Them? (Chuckles)

46:13.403 --> 46:16.372
They don't talk. I say "taco."
They say "taco."

46:16.473 --> 46:20.705
- (Together) Taco, taco, taco.
- Are they OK?

46:20.811 --> 46:23.803
Sure, they're OK.

46:23.914 --> 46:28.408
I don't know about me.
I'm talking to a bird.

46:28.519 --> 46:32.046
OK, I'm talking to a bird.

46:35.926 --> 46:40.192
- Is her daddy's name Moe?
- Uh-uh. Warren.

46:40.297 --> 46:42.197
Oh.

46:42.299 --> 46:46.201
Well, I'm sorry, amigo. Such
an Alweather is not in this book.

46:46.303 --> 46:48.771
Maybe they have an unlisted number.

46:48.872 --> 46:50.772
(Squawking)

46:52.342 --> 46:55.470
Hmm. Pero, ¿sabes qué?

46:55.579 --> 46:57.638
You know what I was thinking?

46:57.748 --> 47:02.117
- Can you carry a tune or dance?
- What do you mean?

47:05.322 --> 47:07.586
Get ready to turn. Da. Turn.

47:07.691 --> 47:09.750
(Humming)

47:09.860 --> 47:12.055
OK, that's it. Come on.

47:12.162 --> 47:15.063
(Humming continues)

47:15.165 --> 47:18.931
- (Squawking)
- No.

47:19.036 --> 47:21.732
(Sighs) Tell you what.

47:21.839 --> 47:26.572
Why don't we have one guy on each
end, and then Lupe in the middle?

47:26.677 --> 47:31.205
OK, uh, Chaco, uh, Paco, hello?

47:32.850 --> 47:34.977
- Come on. Talk to them.
- I'm trying.

47:35.085 --> 47:37.883
- Talk to them in parrot.
- What?

47:37.988 --> 47:39.751
Talk in parrot,
so they'll understand.

47:39.823 --> 47:43.088
- Talk parrot? Right.
- Yeah. Come on now.

47:43.160 --> 47:47.153
OK... (Whistling) Hey,
where you going? What'd I say?

47:47.264 --> 47:51.098
- Man, what did you say?
- I don't know. I don't talk parrot.

47:51.201 --> 47:53.965
Hey! Hey, Paulie! Where did you go?

47:54.071 --> 47:57.404
Hey, all of you! Get your little
feathered butts back in here.

47:57.507 --> 48:01.170
We gotta rehearse.
You think this stuff just happens?

48:05.282 --> 48:10.185
(Clears throat)
Uh, I really like you a lot.

48:10.287 --> 48:13.188
(Yellow bird)
I really like you a lot.

48:13.290 --> 48:15.451
Wow. I'm so glad you feel that way.

48:15.559 --> 48:18.756
(Giggling)
Wow. I'm so glad you feel that way.

48:18.862 --> 48:22.525
- Are you listening?
- Are you listening?

48:22.633 --> 48:26.569
- Or are you just repeating?
- (Laughing)

48:26.637 --> 48:29.367
(Misha) Well, women can be tough.

48:29.473 --> 48:31.873
(Paulie) Tell me about it.

48:31.975 --> 48:35.433
So, how do you know
if you've met the right one?

48:35.545 --> 48:38.946
Well, for me...

48:39.049 --> 48:41.950
Let me see.

48:42.052 --> 48:45.044
She would be pretty, but smart.

48:45.155 --> 48:50.218
She would have books on her table
and flowers in her hair.

48:50.327 --> 48:53.728
- And...
- And lots of golden feathers.

48:53.830 --> 48:57.197
Well, yes, important
to have high standard.

48:57.301 --> 48:59.235
- So, Misha, you got a girlfriend?
- No.

48:59.336 --> 49:03.466
Well, once. Little bit.

49:03.573 --> 49:06.667
What? How do you have
a little bit of a girlfriend?

49:06.777 --> 49:09.007
- Well...
- This is interesting. Go on.

49:10.681 --> 49:14.674
Before I'm coming to America,
there was girl.

49:14.785 --> 49:18.221
We were student together
at university.

49:18.322 --> 49:23.692
Sure, we talk about books.
We even fight about them.

49:23.794 --> 49:26.922
She was very smart. And stubborn.

49:27.030 --> 49:29.021
I say book mean one thing.

49:29.099 --> 49:32.660
She say, "No, Misha.
Book mean other thing."

49:34.805 --> 49:38.832
One time, she act in play...

49:38.942 --> 49:40.910
in front of whole school.

49:41.011 --> 49:45.914
I was working behind curtain,
in dark.

49:46.016 --> 49:50.350
I see her on stage.

49:50.454 --> 49:55.551
She had little flowers
in her hair...

49:55.659 --> 49:59.891
and the light make them all...

49:59.997 --> 50:01.897
different color.

50:04.634 --> 50:08.536
And I say to myself,
"My God, she's beautiful.

50:10.407 --> 50:15.709
"Maybe too beautiful for me,
but I will tell her how I feel."

50:17.581 --> 50:22.575
Afterward,
when I'm come near to her...

50:24.688 --> 50:26.883
She stole your words away.

50:27.991 --> 50:30.084
Yes.

50:32.696 --> 50:35.688
She marry my best friend.

50:35.799 --> 50:38.825
He told her how he feel.

50:40.370 --> 50:44.966
At wedding,
she take me aside and say,

50:45.075 --> 50:50.342
"Misha, I always like you best,

50:50.447 --> 50:53.348
"but I was afraid...

50:53.450 --> 50:56.351
"afraid of your silence."

51:03.193 --> 51:05.093
It's important to speak up.

51:07.397 --> 51:09.797
So, you're going to tell me
what happened to Lupe,

51:09.900 --> 51:13.927
or shall I go sweep more floor?

51:14.037 --> 51:15.937
(Paulie) OK, OK.

51:17.874 --> 51:19.774
(Singing in Spanish)

51:19.876 --> 51:25.041
(Paulie) 'So I had a girl in L.A.,
all the mangos I could eat.

51:25.148 --> 51:28.083
'Everything was going great.
But you know how it is.

51:28.919 --> 51:30.784
'Soon as you think you're OK,

51:30.854 --> 51:33.516
'the past comes back to bite
your tail feathers.'

51:33.590 --> 51:36.081
- Come on. Let's go, will ya?
- Yeah.

51:40.931 --> 51:45.163
(Singing in Spanish)

51:51.741 --> 51:53.732
Come on, come on. Sit down.

51:53.810 --> 51:56.608
What are we doing here?
You never take me any place nice.

51:56.680 --> 52:00.116
What are you talking about?
This is nice. Look at this.

52:00.217 --> 52:02.117
Because you're a loser, that's why.

52:02.219 --> 52:04.983
Would you stop with the loser.
I'm not a loser.

52:05.088 --> 52:07.386
I'm just lookin' for the right angle.

52:07.457 --> 52:09.322
Angle. Listen to you.

52:11.094 --> 52:13.062
Hey, could I get a drink today, huh?

52:13.163 --> 52:15.757
(Continues singing in Spanish)

52:19.970 --> 52:22.063
Any drink, please. Somebody.

52:23.540 --> 52:26.008
Did you see that?

52:33.183 --> 52:36.346
I think I know that bird
from somewhere.

52:45.862 --> 52:50.526
Hey, taco guy! Come on!

52:50.634 --> 52:52.864
Come over here! Yeah.

52:52.969 --> 52:55.767
Hey, I'll give you $50
for that green parrot over there.

52:55.872 --> 52:58.602
- What? For Paulie?
- I don't know. Yeah.

52:58.708 --> 53:01.176
No, I'm sorry, señor,
he's not for sale.

53:01.244 --> 53:04.042
50 bucks. Use it for something.
He's a parrot.

53:04.147 --> 53:06.047
He could get lost
or get eaten by a goat.

53:06.149 --> 53:08.049
This way, you got something
to show for him.

53:08.151 --> 53:11.848
Like I said, thank you,
but he's not for sale.

53:11.955 --> 53:14.355
You know what?
Maybe you can help me, though.

53:14.457 --> 53:16.948
My bird is looking for his friend,
Marie Alweather.

53:17.060 --> 53:19.153
Do you know anybody by that name?

53:19.262 --> 53:21.662
- Alweather? In East L. A?
- Sí. Sí.

53:21.765 --> 53:24.233
- What a jerk.
- OK, well, gracias.

53:24.334 --> 53:26.495
Come on, taco man.
I'm just joking around.

53:26.603 --> 53:29.003
Come on. 50 bucks.

53:32.909 --> 53:36.003
Everybody wants
a piece of the action, huh?

53:36.112 --> 53:38.273
You know, I was thinking
about costumes, you know?

53:38.381 --> 53:40.474
What about
a little fruit hat for Lupe?

53:40.584 --> 53:44.714
You know, like that...
what's her name... Dolores Del Rio.

53:47.524 --> 53:50.084
What's the matter, my friend?

53:50.193 --> 53:53.685
Mm, I know. You're thinking
about Marie, huh?

53:53.797 --> 53:57.460
No, I was thinking about Lupe
wearing nothing but that fruit hat.

53:59.769 --> 54:02.795
You are some kind of weird bird,
my friend.

54:02.906 --> 54:06.137
But tonight, we sing, hmm?
Have a big time.

54:08.245 --> 54:11.180
(Paulie)
'Ignacio was all right for a human.

54:11.281 --> 54:13.340
'He knew me better
than I knew myself.

54:13.450 --> 54:16.476
'I hadn't forgotten Marie,
but I got a little sidetracked.

54:16.586 --> 54:19.578
'I had the prettiest parrot in L.A.
interested only in me,

54:19.689 --> 54:23.284
'I was in show business, and
for once in my life, I was a bird.'

54:23.393 --> 54:26.294
(Lupe) # Estoy loca
(Ignacio) # She's crazy

54:26.396 --> 54:30.389
# Mucho crazy
# Estoy loca por ti, mi amor

54:30.500 --> 54:32.559
# No te vayas
# Don't go away

54:32.669 --> 54:35.263
# Ven aca
# She's to stay

54:35.372 --> 54:38.637
(Lupe) # Estoy loca por ti, mi amor

54:38.742 --> 54:41.905
# Estoy loco, estoy loco
# She is crazy, very loca

54:42.012 --> 54:45.880
# Estoy loco por ti, mi amor

54:45.982 --> 54:48.974
# No te vayas, ven aca
# Don't go away, you heard her

54:49.085 --> 54:52.748
# Estoy loco por ti, mi amor... #

54:52.856 --> 54:55.689
Cops? Yeah, how ya doin'?

54:55.759 --> 54:58.990
I don't normally do this.
I'm just trying to be a good citizen.

54:59.095 --> 55:02.292
You know what I mean?
I'm down here at this taco stand,

55:02.399 --> 55:04.867
and I gotta be honest,
it's pretty disgusting.

55:04.934 --> 55:07.494
There's no floor,
no roof, no bathrooms.

55:07.604 --> 55:11.734
And I gotta be honest, there's gotta
be 1,000 maniacs running around here.

55:11.841 --> 55:14.469
There's rats the size of footballs,

55:14.544 --> 55:16.842
and a guy's serving alcohol
to children.

55:16.946 --> 55:18.937
Is that allowed? I didn't think so.

55:19.049 --> 55:22.644
Why don't you come and help me out?
I'm tryin' to do a good deed.

55:22.752 --> 55:26.586
# I am crazy, I so crazy
# She's crazy, so crazy

55:26.690 --> 55:30.148
# I am crazy for you, my love

55:30.260 --> 55:34.162
# Don't go away, I'm here to stay
# No te vayas, ven aca

55:34.264 --> 55:37.427
# 'Cause I am crazy for you,
my amor

55:37.534 --> 55:41.300
# I am crazy for you, my love

55:41.404 --> 55:44.339
# Estoy loca por ti, mi amor

55:44.441 --> 55:47.501
(Vocalizing)

55:52.782 --> 55:54.943
(Music ends, audience cheering)

55:55.051 --> 55:58.919
Police! Hey, look! It's the cops!
Come on! Let's get out of here!

55:58.988 --> 56:01.218
(Screaming, chattering)

56:01.324 --> 56:04.157
(Paulie) Hey, what's goin' on?
Where's everybody goin'

56:04.260 --> 56:06.490
Go on! Get out of here!

56:06.596 --> 56:08.860
Lupe, you dropped your hat!

56:10.600 --> 56:12.864
(Paulie) Come on!
Come on, let me out of here!

56:12.969 --> 56:14.869
Where am I?

56:16.106 --> 56:19.667
Would you let me out of here,
please?

56:19.776 --> 56:23.872
- Who are you?
- I'm Benny. You don't remember me?

56:23.980 --> 56:28.383
- Think back. The pawn shop?
- Where's Ignacio?

56:28.485 --> 56:30.976
Who knows? He's probably
halfway to Guatemala by now.

56:31.087 --> 56:33.419
- Why?
- Because he's an illegal.

56:33.523 --> 56:36.617
Oh, yeah?
And what does that make you?

56:36.726 --> 56:40.059
(Sighs) Look, pal.

56:40.163 --> 56:43.724
You're going about finding
your friend Marie the wrong way.

56:43.833 --> 56:47.064
You got dreams, man.
I respect that. I got dreams.

56:47.170 --> 56:50.833
You're never gonna find your friend
from singing under sombreros.

56:50.940 --> 56:53.374
If you want something,
you gotta do more than just dream.

56:53.476 --> 56:55.376
You gotta get out there.
You gotta take it.

56:55.478 --> 56:57.378
- Take it?
- Yeah, take it.

56:57.480 --> 57:00.005
That's the only way
we'll get a piece of the pie.

57:00.116 --> 57:02.516
- I like pie.
- What?

57:02.619 --> 57:04.746
I said, "I like pie."

57:04.854 --> 57:08.290
Yeah, I like pie, too.

57:16.266 --> 57:19.201
Look at the size of this place, man.

57:19.302 --> 57:21.202
(Engine shuts off)

57:21.304 --> 57:24.467
- You're not gonna kiss me, are ya?
- What? Get outta here.

57:24.574 --> 57:27.941
If you wanna find Marie, you're
gonna need lots of the green stuff.

57:28.044 --> 57:30.842
- Green stuff?
- Yeah, green stuff.

57:30.947 --> 57:33.643
- Money.
- What for?

57:33.750 --> 57:36.241
What for? For phone books.

57:36.352 --> 57:40.220
That's how you find somebody. You
gotta look 'em up in a phone book.

57:40.323 --> 57:41.813
It's very expensive.

57:41.891 --> 57:45.759
It's not like somebody comes and
drops a bunch on your doorstep.

57:45.862 --> 57:47.227
Come on, Benny!

57:47.297 --> 57:51.631
Hey, what if she ain't
in the phone book? That's what...

57:51.734 --> 57:54.328
Then you gotta hire some private
detective or something.

57:55.972 --> 57:59.032
I don't know, pal.
It's a very expensive operation.

58:01.578 --> 58:03.512
Don't worry, though.
We'll find Marie.

58:03.613 --> 58:07.310
Just gotta come up
with the right plan.

58:07.417 --> 58:09.510
(Paulie) 'Benny had a lot of plans.

58:09.619 --> 58:13.282
'Most of 'em stunk, but the one
about hiring a detective was good.

58:14.123 --> 58:16.751
'I figured, for the right amount
of green stuff,

58:16.860 --> 58:19.624
'any detective worth his trench coat
could find her.

58:19.729 --> 58:22.163
'So, we became a team.'

58:27.303 --> 58:29.863
Five, zero, seven, zero.

58:45.822 --> 58:48.416
- Oh, jeez, I'm sorry. Excuse me.
- Watch where you're goin'.

58:48.525 --> 58:51.153
I'm sorry. Excuse me. OK.

59:14.250 --> 59:17.583
(Paulie) 'Benny said money was the
most important thing in the world.

59:17.687 --> 59:22.021
'So, deep down, people would
understand if you stole it.

59:23.693 --> 59:26.662
'Towards the end of the month, the
pickings were always a little slim.

59:26.763 --> 59:30.597
'I don't know if that's cos they
spent it all or cos we stole it.'

59:30.700 --> 59:34.659
(Beeping, buzzing)

59:36.039 --> 59:38.234
Move it along, fella.
You're broke. Come on.

59:45.281 --> 59:48.216
(Paulie) 'But the real problem
in all of this was Benny.

59:48.318 --> 59:51.048
'He was a small-timer
any way you looked at it.

59:51.154 --> 59:54.749
'Jumpin' up and down over 20s
when there were bigger fish to fry.'

59:54.857 --> 59:57.849
- (Seagulls screeching)
- (Benny and Paulie laughing)

59:57.961 --> 01:00:00.987
Get 'em! Get 'em!

01:00:01.097 --> 01:00:03.861
I gotta tell you, Paulie. God!

01:00:03.967 --> 01:00:05.867
You are the greatest thing
to ever happen to me, man.

01:00:05.969 --> 01:00:08.096
Hey, thanks, man.

01:00:08.204 --> 01:00:11.367
No, I'm serious, Paulie.
You're the best.

01:00:11.474 --> 01:00:16.070
Excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt
your little testosterone festival,

01:00:16.179 --> 01:00:18.079
but the bird hasn't made us
that much money.

01:00:18.181 --> 01:00:22.550
Hello? What are you talking about,
"that much money"? We're doin' great!

01:00:22.652 --> 01:00:26.645
I should be, like,
lounging by a pool in a mansion,

01:00:26.756 --> 01:00:30.123
wearing a mink coat and,
like, 18-karat diamond earrings.

01:00:30.226 --> 01:00:33.923
She's right. We're wasting our time,
when there are rocks to be grifted.

01:00:35.732 --> 01:00:39.463
- What do you know about diamonds?
- We met in a pawnshop, Einstein.

01:00:39.569 --> 01:00:42.732
You can tell a real diamond
from a fake?

01:00:42.805 --> 01:00:43.897
Yeah.

01:00:44.007 --> 01:00:46.771
I've seen shot glasses
cut better than that.

01:00:48.444 --> 01:00:51.811
I cannot believe you, Benito.

01:00:51.914 --> 01:00:55.850
You're gonna get me a real diamond,
and you're gonna help him.

01:00:55.918 --> 01:00:58.887
Diamonds?
Ruby, it's a little out of my league.

01:00:58.955 --> 01:01:00.616
Your league, but not his.

01:01:00.723 --> 01:01:02.691
(Ruby) Park right there.
(Benny) Where?

01:01:02.759 --> 01:01:05.819
(Paulie) 'Finally, these
canary brains got the right idea.

01:01:05.928 --> 01:01:09.420
'A couple of night flybys
and I found the perfect target.

01:01:09.532 --> 01:01:12.501
'We stopped by Ruby's favorite
restaurant for a burrito

01:01:12.568 --> 01:01:14.160
'before the big heist.'

01:01:14.237 --> 01:01:16.068
(Paulie) Would you hurry up?

01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:19.437
- 'That was a bad idea.'
- (Paulie) Hurry up. Pull over.

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:21.477
(Farts)

01:01:22.912 --> 01:01:25.346
(Paulie) Sorry.

01:01:25.448 --> 01:01:28.144
Paulie, would you excuse us
for a minute, please?

01:01:28.251 --> 01:01:31.414
- OK.
- There you are. All right, come on.

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:35.013
I'll talk to you in a second, pal.

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:38.918
(Benny) Do you think
that's a good idea? A chimney?

01:01:39.028 --> 01:01:42.156
It's not exactly parrot-friendly.
He could twist an ankle.

01:01:42.265 --> 01:01:45.530
What is your problem, Benito?
He's a freakin' bird! Just tell him.

01:01:45.635 --> 01:01:47.034
- Now?
- Now!

01:01:47.103 --> 01:01:48.365
All right.

01:01:53.743 --> 01:01:59.010
- That Ruby's high maintenance.
- (Chuckles) Yeah.

01:01:59.082 --> 01:02:03.075
Hey, but after tonight, we'll have
enough money to find your Marie.

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:06.587
Come on,
who's the coolest bird in L. A?

01:02:06.689 --> 01:02:09.351
- Get out of town.
- Paulie's my main man. Right?

01:02:09.459 --> 01:02:12.087
Dude.

01:02:12.195 --> 01:02:14.390
Go on, Paulie.
Get the jewelry for us.

01:02:16.766 --> 01:02:18.757
Go ahead, buddy. Go ahead.

01:02:28.478 --> 01:02:30.946
Here comes Santa!

01:02:31.047 --> 01:02:33.447
(Grunts and coughs)

01:02:34.851 --> 01:02:37.911
(Sneezes)

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:39.988
(Paulie) 'The most important thing

01:02:40.056 --> 01:02:43.150
'is to leave nothing that links you
to the scene of the crime.'

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:00.065
(Panting)

01:03:03.312 --> 01:03:06.281
- (Snoring)
- 'Concentration is everything.

01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:09.577
'First, you have to identify
your target.'

(Muttering)

01:03:32.008 --> 01:03:36.968
'It was a box full of cheesy costume
jewelry, except for one pendant.

01:03:37.079 --> 01:03:41.379
'I figured 1920s 14-karat gold's
gotta be worth 950.'

01:03:41.484 --> 01:03:44.510
(Grunting)

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:47.111
(Benny) What's taking him so long?
(Ruby) I don't know.

01:03:47.223 --> 01:03:50.750
(Grunting and groaning)

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:52.794
Come on. Come on.

01:03:52.895 --> 01:03:55.489
Come... (Yells)

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:15.376
Maybe I should go, you know?
See if he's OK, you know?

01:04:19.255 --> 01:04:22.053
- I'm gonna go see if he's OK.
- Benny!

01:04:29.432 --> 01:04:33.368
Hold it right there. Turn around.

01:04:35.071 --> 01:04:37.039
Put 'em up! Drop it!

01:04:37.139 --> 01:04:39.972
What are you doing
with Grandma's necklace?

01:04:40.076 --> 01:04:42.544
Uh... I'm taking it.

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:46.514
Paulie. Paulie.

01:04:46.616 --> 01:04:48.709
Oh! (Grunting)

01:04:48.818 --> 01:04:51.252
- (Yelling)
- (Screaming)

01:04:51.354 --> 01:04:53.549
Grandpa!

01:04:53.656 --> 01:04:56.284
- (Ruby) What is going on?
- Open the window!

01:04:56.392 --> 01:04:59.259
Don't leave me! I'm stuck in here!
Benny, the kid's got a weapon!

01:04:59.362 --> 01:05:02.695
Benny! Benny! Benny, where ya goin'?

01:05:02.798 --> 01:05:06.097
Benny! Benny!

01:05:06.202 --> 01:05:08.067
(Paulie) 'Benny taught me
a lot of things,

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:10.536
'but there was one thing
he never mentioned.

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:13.905
'What we were doing was wrong,
and you always pay.'

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:16.843
- (Paulie) I said I was sorry, pal.
- Here he is.

01:05:16.946 --> 01:05:18.914
Come on, would you
let me out of the box?

01:05:19.015 --> 01:05:21.643
- He talked up a storm on the way.
- I'm sure.

01:05:21.717 --> 01:05:23.844
- Take a look at this little fellow.
- Jeez.

01:05:25.388 --> 01:05:27.982
Oh.

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:30.251
Little conure.

01:05:30.359 --> 01:05:32.259
Does he have a name?

01:05:32.361 --> 01:05:34.955
Yeah, Paulie.

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:41.464
- So, he flew down your chimney.
- Well, that's what he told me.

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:43.470
Ah. (Chuckles)

01:05:43.572 --> 01:05:46.541
Well, many parrots have quite
extensive vocabularies,

01:05:46.642 --> 01:05:50.339
but there's a difference between
cognizant speech and parroting.

01:05:50.413 --> 01:05:51.937
(Paulie) "Aviator Supply Center."

01:05:52.014 --> 01:05:55.245
He keeps talking
about a Marie Alweather.

01:05:55.351 --> 01:05:57.819
- (Paulie) Hey.
- I think she might be his owner.

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:00.286
Well, that's not unusual, either.

01:06:00.389 --> 01:06:04.155
Lots of people train their birds
to repeat names...

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:06.160
and addresses in case they get lost.

01:06:06.262 --> 01:06:08.890
- I'm sure that's the case.
- Do you have a phone book?

01:06:10.399 --> 01:06:12.299
- Pardon?
- Please?

01:06:12.401 --> 01:06:15.029
He's very polite.

01:06:15.137 --> 01:06:18.800
I'm sure that's
just a trained response.

01:06:18.908 --> 01:06:21.172
But I'd like to keep him here
a few days...

01:06:21.277 --> 01:06:24.337
and maybe, uh, run some tests.

01:06:24.447 --> 01:06:26.813
Build him up a bit.
He looks a little undernourished.

01:06:26.916 --> 01:06:28.816
But, uh, don't worry.

01:06:28.918 --> 01:06:31.512
You did the right thing
bringing him here, Gerald.

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:34.020
- We'll take good care of him.
- OK.

01:06:34.123 --> 01:06:37.320
I want you to understand
what it is we do here.

01:06:37.426 --> 01:06:41.157
Mostly we just listen and we watch.

01:06:41.263 --> 01:06:46.132
You see, there's this gap
between animals and humans.

01:06:46.235 --> 01:06:49.227
And the gap is called speech.

01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:53.468
Now, if that gap could be bridged,
we could truly understand each other.

01:06:53.576 --> 01:06:56.443
Won't you consider helping us?

01:06:56.545 --> 01:07:01.039
Tell you what. I'm gonna have
you moved out of here tonight.

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:03.675
And I promise you,

01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:06.313
I will take you to see Marie
when we're done.

01:07:11.594 --> 01:07:13.721
Maybe I'm the one
who should be locked up.

01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:15.956
You promise?

01:07:22.772 --> 01:07:24.706
I promise.

01:07:24.807 --> 01:07:26.707
(Man) We're going to
ask you some questions.

01:07:26.809 --> 01:07:30.301
We'd like for you
to identify the picture.

01:07:30.413 --> 01:07:32.472
- What is this?
- Duck.

01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:38.983
- What is this?
- Kite. Umbrella.

01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:41.250
I don't see
how this is bridging the gap.

01:07:41.357 --> 01:07:45.316
I know this is frustrating,
but we have to follow protocol

01:07:45.394 --> 01:07:48.659
to prove that you're capable
of cognizant speech.

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:51.029
Everyone can see that I can talk.

01:07:55.137 --> 01:07:57.332
- What is this?
- Now, what is that word again...

01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:01.342
for a dish composed of meat,
fowl, fish or vegetables,

01:08:01.444 --> 01:08:03.344
covered in a layer of paste
and baked?

01:08:03.446 --> 01:08:06.040
Oh, yeah. It's a pie. Then again,

01:08:06.148 --> 01:08:09.515
a pie can be a magpie,
a collection of rules, a copper coin

01:08:09.618 --> 01:08:12.246
or what you call a fine lookin' lady.

01:08:12.354 --> 01:08:14.754
And if you don't believe me,
look it up, blondie.

01:08:14.857 --> 01:08:17.553
Pie can also mean a whole, as in
the pie of which we crave a piece,

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:21.187
like the whole enchilada,
the big salami, the grand prize.

01:08:21.296 --> 01:08:24.357
The talking bird which you hope
will make you rich. That kind of pie.

01:08:24.466 --> 01:08:26.627
Me! I'm the pie here.
And if you don't mind...

01:08:26.734 --> 01:08:29.033
taking your fingers
out of me for a moment,

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:31.163
I'd like to get some lunch,
you lab rat!

01:08:33.274 --> 01:08:35.175
How do I score that?

01:08:37.746 --> 01:08:40.374
You said that?

01:08:40.483 --> 01:08:43.542
I told you,
talking just gets you into trouble.

01:08:43.652 --> 01:08:46.120
No. It's not that.

01:08:48.057 --> 01:08:51.890
It's how you say things.
You have to be careful.

01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:55.563
Woman say, "You like my hat?"

01:08:55.663 --> 01:08:58.154
You say,
"No, make you look like floor lamp."

01:08:58.267 --> 01:09:00.167
You get punch in nose.

01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:02.567
I got worse than that.

01:09:03.404 --> 01:09:07.966
- (Snoring)
- (Door opens and closes)

01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:14.572
(Dialing phone)

01:09:14.683 --> 01:09:16.981
(Reingold)
Yes, Dr. Manning, he's asleep.

01:09:17.086 --> 01:09:19.953
- Yeah, this will put us on the map.
- (Grunt)

01:09:20.055 --> 01:09:22.182
This will change everything.
I'm telling you,

01:09:22.291 --> 01:09:25.317
he is the most extraordinary
creature I have ever encountered.

01:09:25.426 --> 01:09:28.828
Yeah, well,
I have grant committees

01:09:28.930 --> 01:09:31.331
from the N.I.H. and the N.S.F.

01:09:31.433 --> 01:09:35.301
Some guy from the National Geographic
is talking about a special.

01:09:35.404 --> 01:09:37.304
(Chuckling)

01:09:37.406 --> 01:09:39.533
Mmm.

01:09:39.642 --> 01:09:43.975
Actually, I have located the owner.
It's Marie Alweather.

01:09:44.078 --> 01:09:46.639
- She lives in Cambria, California.
- Marie?

01:09:46.749 --> 01:09:50.116
Uh, yes.

01:09:50.219 --> 01:09:52.118
Yes, I understand.

01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:56.358
No, I agree.

01:09:56.425 --> 01:10:00.691
There's no legal requirement
that we have to return him.

01:10:00.763 --> 01:10:02.958
He's the property
of the Institute now.

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:04.659
(Paulie) What?

01:10:06.569 --> 01:10:08.628
- So, I'll see you tomorrow.
- (Paulie) Property?

01:10:08.737 --> 01:10:11.365
OK. Bye-bye. (Hangs up)

01:10:11.473 --> 01:10:15.000
It is the thing that makes us us.

01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:17.943
And because language is so tied...

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:20.038
to what it is to be human,

01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:23.550
we have always been urged not
to attribute human characteristics,

01:10:23.652 --> 01:10:26.553
like consciousness
and logic and feelings,

01:10:26.622 --> 01:10:29.182
to our non-speaking animal subjects.

01:10:29.291 --> 01:10:31.418
Until now.

01:10:33.362 --> 01:10:36.126
What we are proposing...

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:39.201
is a multidisciplinary
research program,

01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:44.034
that will not only unlock
the mystery of animal communication,

01:10:44.139 --> 01:10:46.505
but get to the heart
of language itself.

01:10:46.609 --> 01:10:50.204
And just as every journey
starts with a single step,

01:10:50.312 --> 01:10:53.406
this program starts with a single,
extraordinary subject.

01:10:53.515 --> 01:10:57.349
- Hello, Paulie. How are you today?
- (Squawk!) Paulie want a cracker!

01:10:57.453 --> 01:11:01.014
(Laughing)

01:11:01.123 --> 01:11:04.058
I thought you liked mangos the best.

01:11:04.159 --> 01:11:06.286
(Paulie) Paulie want a cracker.

01:11:06.395 --> 01:11:10.354
(Chuckling) Well, we can get
a lot of crackers later.

01:11:10.466 --> 01:11:12.559
Let's, uh, take a look
at the flash cards.

01:11:12.668 --> 01:11:14.568
(Paulie)
'They wanted a talking bird? Fine.

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:17.138
'I was gonna give them
a talking bird.'

01:11:17.239 --> 01:11:19.139
- What is this?
- Up yours.

01:11:19.241 --> 01:11:22.142
- What is this?
- Up yours, jackass!

01:11:22.244 --> 01:11:25.441
- (Indistinct chattering)
- This is just opening-night jitters.

01:11:27.216 --> 01:11:29.480
- What are you doing?
- Up yours!

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:35.786
- Why are you doing this?
- You promised.

01:11:37.192 --> 01:11:40.059
Liar. Liar!

01:11:40.162 --> 01:11:42.824
Liar! Liar! Liar!

01:11:42.931 --> 01:11:45.991
Liar! Liar!

01:11:46.101 --> 01:11:48.296
- Close the door!
- (Gasping)

01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:57.274
Can't have him
trying to fly away again.

01:11:57.346 --> 01:11:59.610
He could seriously injure himself.

01:11:59.715 --> 01:12:01.979
(Grunting)

01:12:09.992 --> 01:12:12.426
I'm just gonna cut a few primary
flight feathers. It won't hurt.

01:12:12.528 --> 01:12:16.089
No. Oh, come on. (Grunting)

01:12:16.198 --> 01:12:20.931
- This is for your own good.
- Don't! (Grunting)

01:12:21.036 --> 01:12:22.970
(Paulie) 'They were cutting me.

01:12:23.038 --> 01:12:26.667
'They were taking away the one thing
that made me different from them.'

01:12:28.243 --> 01:12:31.542
(Crying) No!

01:12:33.482 --> 01:12:37.976
(Paulie)
I never talked to anybody again.

01:12:38.087 --> 01:12:41.784
Then when I started biting people,
they moved me out of the sun.

01:12:43.559 --> 01:12:46.119
When was that?

01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:47.753
I can't even remember.

01:12:52.601 --> 01:12:54.000
(Door opens)

01:12:54.069 --> 01:12:58.165
(Virgil) Wrap it up down there.
Don't forget to lock up.

01:13:00.743 --> 01:13:03.041
We will find your Marie.

01:13:05.781 --> 01:13:08.215
That's what they all said.

01:13:17.826 --> 01:13:20.590
Now, we'll get you out, Paulie.

01:13:21.697 --> 01:13:23.597
What... What are you...

01:13:23.699 --> 01:13:26.190
What are you doing, Misha? Come on.

01:13:26.268 --> 01:13:28.361
I don't think you know
what you're doing.

01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:31.337
They could have you deported.
Come on, Misha.

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:33.670
You're making too much noise.

01:13:33.776 --> 01:13:37.837
You're destroying laboratory
property. They're gonna fire you!

01:13:40.215 --> 01:13:41.773
Misha.

01:13:50.859 --> 01:13:54.693
(Panting) Come, Paulie. Come on.

01:13:54.797 --> 01:13:57.698
Don't be afraid.

01:13:59.668 --> 01:14:01.568
Come.

01:14:05.607 --> 01:14:07.507
Come, Paulie.

01:14:14.616 --> 01:14:16.516
Let's go.

01:14:29.198 --> 01:14:32.565
You tell me Dr. Reingold
find where Marie lives.

01:14:32.668 --> 01:14:35.228
Maybe address is still in his office.

01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:51.681
Not in "Paulie" file.
Not in "Parrot" file.

01:14:51.753 --> 01:14:53.846
Not in any bird file.

01:14:53.956 --> 01:14:56.322
Look in the human file.
Look under little girls.

01:14:56.425 --> 01:15:00.088
- Look in the "Marie" file.
- "Marie?"

01:15:00.195 --> 01:15:03.631
Alweather. Alweather!

01:15:09.304 --> 01:15:12.796
(Misha) Marie Alweather. M.A.

01:15:15.878 --> 01:15:17.846
What? What is it?

01:15:31.093 --> 01:15:33.288
"M.A."

01:15:33.395 --> 01:15:35.522
M.A. Marie Alweather.

01:15:35.631 --> 01:15:39.567
1440 Spruce Lane,
Cambria, California.

01:15:53.916 --> 01:15:55.816
Hello?

01:15:55.918 --> 01:15:59.820
Excuse me, please.
Sorry I'm calling so early.

01:15:59.922 --> 01:16:02.152
Does Marie Alweather live there?

01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:05.459
(Paulie) Marie?

01:16:06.762 --> 01:16:09.595
Can you tell her I found Paulie.

01:16:09.698 --> 01:16:12.360
Marie! Marie! Hey, Marie, it's me!

01:16:12.467 --> 01:16:15.231
- Shh.
- Marie! Marie! It's me, Paulie!

01:16:15.337 --> 01:16:17.237
(Laughing and cheering)

01:16:17.339 --> 01:16:21.298
No, uh, l-l-I'm telling you...

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:25.471
- Paulie. I found him.
- Marie! Marie! Marie!

01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:27.572
What do you think you're doing?

01:16:28.784 --> 01:16:33.221
Uh, I've come cleaning office. So...
But I later come back.

01:16:33.288 --> 01:16:35.848
What's the bird doing
out of his cage?

01:16:36.491 --> 01:16:38.391
Well...

01:16:39.394 --> 01:16:41.362
Get the bird.

01:16:42.898 --> 01:16:44.263
Come on.

01:16:45.901 --> 01:16:49.234
- Look, just grab...
- No. No!

01:16:49.338 --> 01:16:51.806
- (Squawking)
- No! Hey!

01:16:51.907 --> 01:16:54.467
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm taking him.

01:16:54.576 --> 01:16:56.874
- You're what?
- I'm taking him where he belongs.

01:16:56.979 --> 01:16:59.573
He belongs to the Institute.

01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:03.139
No, he belongs to little girl
who needs him.

01:17:03.251 --> 01:17:06.812
And you knew.
You knew it all the time.

01:17:06.922 --> 01:17:09.755
Paulie, come.

01:17:09.858 --> 01:17:11.917
Who do you think you are?

01:17:14.596 --> 01:17:18.828
I am Mikeal Andreovich Belenkoff.

01:17:18.934 --> 01:17:22.426
And you are a liar and a coward
and a very rude man.

01:17:22.537 --> 01:17:24.562
And you're fired.

01:17:24.673 --> 01:17:28.165
No. No. I am not fire.

01:17:28.276 --> 01:17:30.972
- I am quit.
- You...

01:17:37.786 --> 01:17:39.686
(Paulie) Uh-oh.

01:17:48.163 --> 01:17:50.188
Stop that man!

01:17:57.472 --> 01:18:00.168
It's locked!

01:18:00.275 --> 01:18:03.108
- (Knocking)
- Get out of the way!

01:18:09.918 --> 01:18:11.385
Get somebody!

01:18:25.434 --> 01:18:27.334
(Reingold) Open this door!

01:18:27.436 --> 01:18:30.030
Open this door!

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:40.412
(Reingold) Don't do this!

01:18:47.422 --> 01:18:49.913
- Paulie.
- Wait.

01:18:50.025 --> 01:18:53.051
- Come. Come.
- Wait!

01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:58.561
- Where you are going?
- Come on. Help me.

01:19:10.812 --> 01:19:12.279
(Squeaking)

01:19:18.887 --> 01:19:21.287
(Loud animal noises)

01:20:24.119 --> 01:20:28.180
(Woman) Yeah, it's just
about half a mile down the road.

01:20:28.256 --> 01:20:31.748
Bye. Good luck.

01:20:37.899 --> 01:20:40.390
I think this is the one.

01:20:46.641 --> 01:20:49.439
I can't breathe.

01:20:49.544 --> 01:20:51.444
Look.

01:20:53.315 --> 01:20:55.840
(Paulie) It's her. Misha, it's her.

01:20:55.951 --> 01:20:57.885
(Misha) Now I can't breathe.

01:21:00.088 --> 01:21:02.579
(Paulie) Marie? Marie?

01:21:04.726 --> 01:21:08.184
- No, no, no. Please, please, wait.
- It's not her.

01:21:08.296 --> 01:21:10.992
- Not?
- It's not Marie.

01:21:11.099 --> 01:21:12.999
(Door closes)

01:21:13.101 --> 01:21:15.262
(Sighs)

01:21:17.472 --> 01:21:21.431
- Maybe it's wrong house.
- It's always the wrong house.

01:21:21.576 --> 01:21:23.476
Paulie?

01:21:27.415 --> 01:21:29.315
Paulie, is that really you?

01:21:31.853 --> 01:21:34.219
It's me, Paulie. It's Marie.

01:21:34.322 --> 01:21:36.347
No.

01:21:38.693 --> 01:21:41.628
Paulie, don't be afraid.

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:45.097
I just grew up, that's all.

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:48.260
Go away. Leave me alone.

01:21:49.704 --> 01:21:50.932
Paulie?

01:21:51.039 --> 01:21:54.031
I'm sorry. We are in shock.

01:21:58.313 --> 01:22:01.840
- Paulie, come back here.
- It's not Marie. It's not her.

01:22:07.656 --> 01:22:11.786
(Marie) # You're the song
that the tree sings

01:22:11.893 --> 01:22:16.296
# When the wind blows

01:22:16.398 --> 01:22:19.265
# You're a flower

01:22:19.367 --> 01:22:21.597
# You're a river

01:22:21.703 --> 01:22:24.194
# You're a rainbow... #

01:22:24.306 --> 01:22:26.206
Marie?

01:22:29.177 --> 01:22:32.977
# I loved you the first time

01:22:33.081 --> 01:22:37.313
# I saw you

01:22:37.419 --> 01:22:41.287
# And I always will love you, Marie #

01:22:41.389 --> 01:22:43.254
Marie!

01:22:47.862 --> 01:22:49.830
You got big!

01:22:49.931 --> 01:22:51.831
Mm-hmm.

01:22:51.933 --> 01:22:54.663
- You flew.
- What?

01:22:55.937 --> 01:22:58.064
- You flew, Paulie.
- I did?

01:22:58.139 --> 01:23:03.133
- Yes, you did!
- How? His wings were clipped.

01:23:03.244 --> 01:23:06.042
The feathers must have grown back.
They always do.

01:23:06.114 --> 01:23:07.240
No.

01:23:07.349 --> 01:23:09.977
- You can fly.
- No.

01:23:10.085 --> 01:23:11.985
Oh, yes, you can.

01:23:20.895 --> 01:23:23.261
Whoo-hoo!

01:23:23.365 --> 01:23:25.629
(Paulie laughs)

01:23:36.878 --> 01:23:39.073
Oh, this is my little neighbor,
Kimmy.

01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:42.479
Remember the parrot I told you about,
who helped me when I was little?

01:23:42.584 --> 01:23:44.484
- Uh-huh.
- He's home.

01:23:44.586 --> 01:23:47.783
- Can I play with him sometime?
- Yes.

01:23:54.896 --> 01:23:56.830
I can't thank you enough.

01:23:56.931 --> 01:23:58.990
You're welcome.

01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:03.332
- So, I will go now.
- Oh, no, no. Please don't rush off.

01:24:03.438 --> 01:24:06.771
- Won't you come inside?
- No, it's OK.

01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:09.207
Uh, you will have much to talk about.

01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:13.838
Uh, goodbye. Goodbye, Paulie.

01:24:13.948 --> 01:24:16.542
Misha, where you goin'?

01:24:17.752 --> 01:24:20.482
She has flowers in her hair.

01:24:20.588 --> 01:24:23.819
- (Sighs)
- I bet she has books on her table.

01:24:23.925 --> 01:24:26.052
- Paulie...
- What is he talking about?

01:24:26.161 --> 01:24:29.358
I'm not always sure.

01:24:29.464 --> 01:24:31.728
Misha, don't be afraid to speak.

01:24:34.436 --> 01:24:37.269
I'd love it if you stayed.

01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:47.348
You know, I would like that.
I would like that very much.

01:24:50.185 --> 01:24:52.779
Paulie, how did you find me?

01:24:52.887 --> 01:24:55.651
(Paulie) Well, it's a long story.

01:24:55.757 --> 01:24:57.850
- It's the only kind he knows.
- (Chuckles)
