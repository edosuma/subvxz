Batten the hatches!

00:54.387 --> 00:55.388
Oh!

00:55.472 --> 00:57.724
I'll batten your hatches, you idiot!

00:58.224 --> 01:00.894
Fear not! No pirate will get past me.

01:00.977 --> 01:03.938
There are no pirates.
Haven't been in years.

01:04.022 --> 01:07.150
That's where you're wrong.
I know they're coming any day now.

01:07.233 --> 01:10.737
But fear not,
the Great Captain Usopp will protect you.

01:10.820 --> 01:14.574
When are you gonna stop
wasting your life, Usopp? It's pathetic.

-Nami!
-What?

01:48.942 --> 01:50.026
[Luffy] It's ready!

01:50.610 --> 01:52.570
And what is it?

01:53.279 --> 01:58.034
Our Jolly Roger. Every pirate crew
has to have one. And now we do!

01:58.118 --> 02:00.411
We're not a crew,
and you are not hanging that on my boat.

02:07.001 --> 02:07.877
That's unique.

Nami, I think the toilet's busted.

We don't have a toilet.

They way you're clanging
those swords around,

02:46.291 --> 02:47.417
you must've broken something.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.586
Maybe you should've stolen

02:52.797 --> 02:53.923
-Not a crew!
-Not a crew.

02:54.757 --> 02:57.218
We're gonna need a better ship
to make it to the Grand Line.

-Wait. Straw Hat Crew? Really?
-Yeah, I thought it had a nice ring to it.

"Demon" has a nice ring to it.

03:07.270 --> 03:10.273
-Headgear? Not scary.
-Who says pirates have to be scary?

03:12.108 --> 03:14.903
The point is we need a new ship.

03:14.986 --> 03:16.863
So where do we get one?

03:20.658 --> 03:23.411
Our closest bet is the Gecko Islands.

03:23.494 --> 03:26.289
We can probably make it there
before our ship sinks.

03:26.372 --> 03:28.041
Ditch this one and get a better one.

have a head start.

Hey. Move.

04:33.982 --> 04:34.899

Yes.

Yes, sir.

Okay, so we need to get one
with a very, very impressive figurehead.

At least two…

No, no, three masts!
And a really high crow's nest.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.036
Yeah! The ship, we'll take it.

11:02.536 --> 11:07.249
-Technically, she's not for sale.
-Huh?

11:07.333 --> 11:09.168
And technically,

11:10.211 --> 11:12.004
I'm not a salesman.

-Do you even work here?
-Of course I do.

and aviary waste eradication.

-He scrubs barnacles and cleans bird shit.
-He can't help us.

11:24.308 --> 11:26.727
Wait! Wait! Wait! I can help you.

11:27.269 --> 11:31.565
The owner of this ship just happens to be
my closest friend in the world.

11:31.649 --> 11:33.484
Your friend owns this ship?

11:33.567 --> 11:36.028
Not just this one.
She owns the whole shipyard.

11:36.112 --> 11:38.155
She's rich rich.

11:38.239 --> 11:39.156
Oh!

11:39.824 --> 11:41.575
I'm sure you could strike a deal with her.

11:42.868 --> 11:43.703
See?

11:45.996 --> 11:48.165
Well, I guess it couldn't hurt
to say hello.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.878
What the hell did I do with it?

11:55.464 --> 11:58.384
Sir… is there something
I can help you with?

12:00.344 --> 12:02.847
[Garp] You've quite a handle
on basic seamanship.

12:04.265 --> 12:06.225
You learn that
on that pirate ship of yours?

12:07.935 --> 12:08.811
Yes, sir.

12:10.104 --> 12:13.899
I was forced to work alongside the crew.
They'd lock me in the bilge if I didn't.

12:17.027 --> 12:19.363
Our experiences don't define us.

12:19.447 --> 12:22.158
It's what we gain from them that matters.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.910
You learned, and you survived.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.913
Oh. Oh.

12:31.459 --> 12:32.334
Here it is.

12:34.462 --> 12:35.546
You play?

12:37.339 --> 12:39.008
-A little, sir.
-Good.

12:59.069 --> 13:01.572
Let's see if you
can do more than tie knots.

13:09.413 --> 13:11.791
[Luffy] I've never seen
a house this big before.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.209
[Usopp] Impressive, right?

13:13.292 --> 13:16.420
Kaya's given me an open invitation
to drop by anytime I want.

13:16.504 --> 13:17.338
[Luffy] Wow.

13:18.172 --> 13:19.673
All of this just for one person?

13:19.757 --> 13:23.010
Well, she lives here
with her butler and a few other staff.

13:25.012 --> 13:26.222
[Luffy whistles]

13:26.305 --> 13:28.849
Money really shows you
who people truly are.

13:29.725 --> 13:32.436
Most people only care about themselves
and what's theirs.

13:33.312 --> 13:34.897
Sounds like someone I know.

13:36.106 --> 13:39.193
[Nami] And a small staff
makes for easy pickings.

13:40.486 --> 13:43.155
[Zoro] Why? Gonna rob the place blind?

13:44.990 --> 13:46.408
At least a little blurry.

13:49.119 --> 13:52.581
[Luffy] So if you have an invitation,
why are we going around the back way?

13:52.665 --> 13:54.166
[Usopp] I never use the front entrance.

13:54.250 --> 13:57.294
This is more of a VIP entrance
reserved for special guests.

13:57.378 --> 13:58.587
[Zoro] This guy's full of shit.

13:58.671 --> 14:02.216
Yeah. But as long as he gets us
inside the house, who cares?

14:05.678 --> 14:08.430
Oops. You know, there's actually
a more exclusive entrance this way.

14:09.348 --> 14:10.891
-[grunts]
-[Usopp gasps]

14:13.102 --> 14:16.981
-The hell are you doing here, Usopp?
-Buchi, buddy, uh, Kaya's expecting me.

14:17.898 --> 14:21.235
-Another one of your lies.
-Oh.

14:21.318 --> 14:24.446
-You ain't welcome here and you know it.
-I know nothing of the sort.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.740
I'm here to give Kaya
an extra-special gift.

14:27.575 --> 14:28.409
[woman] Usopp!

14:32.204 --> 14:33.330
[woman sighs]

14:34.206 --> 14:35.457
[sighs]

14:35.541 --> 14:37.293
What a wonderful surprise.

14:37.376 --> 14:39.420
[wistful music plays]

14:40.588 --> 14:41.589
[Usopp] Hmm!

14:42.715 --> 14:43.674
Kaya!

14:43.757 --> 14:44.758
[Kaya chuckles]

14:46.260 --> 14:47.177
Happy birthday.

14:48.512 --> 14:50.472
-You remembered.
-Of course I did.

14:51.098 --> 14:51.974
[butler clears throat]

14:55.269 --> 14:56.103
Usopp.

14:57.313 --> 15:00.566
We've had this discussion.
You mustn't show up unannounced.

15:00.649 --> 15:02.151
Nonsense, Klahadore.

15:03.360 --> 15:07.615
Have you come to tell me another story?
I do love hearing about your adventures.

15:07.698 --> 15:10.492
I'll do you one better.
I brought some of my crew.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.369
Is he talking about us?

15:12.453 --> 15:15.581
It's so nice to meet you.
You all must stay for dinner.

15:16.332 --> 15:17.374
[Klahadore] Miss Kaya,

15:18.334 --> 15:20.002
it is a bit last minute.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.714
I'm afraid the kitchen
hasn't prepared for any extra guests.

15:24.798 --> 15:26.050
[Kaya] Please, Klahadore.

15:26.884 --> 15:27.885
It's my birthday.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.346
Can't be too much trouble, can it?

15:33.098 --> 15:34.725
Of course, Miss Kaya.

15:35.601 --> 15:36.644
Anything for you.

15:37.144 --> 15:39.563
All right! When do we eat?

15:39.647 --> 15:42.399
You don't. Not dressed like that.

15:43.525 --> 15:48.238
Sham, kindly show Usopp
and his friends to the guest suites.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.951
You will bathe and change before dinner.

15:53.452 --> 15:54.286
[Sham] Hmm.

15:55.579 --> 15:56.956
A bath does sound nice.

16:00.334 --> 16:01.251
[Luffy] All right!

16:01.335 --> 16:02.836
[indistinct chatter]

16:13.931 --> 16:15.307
[knocking on door]

16:17.559 --> 16:18.686
Yo.

16:21.772 --> 16:24.066
One of these days,
Klahadore is going to figure out

16:24.149 --> 16:26.777
you use the servant's passageways
to sneak in here.

16:26.860 --> 16:28.654
-[Usopp] Uh, uh.
-[Kaya giggles]

16:28.737 --> 16:30.239
[Usopp] So what if he does?

16:31.323 --> 16:32.700
I'll find another way in.

16:32.783 --> 16:35.285
What are you doing here anyway?
Shouldn't you be getting ready?

16:36.537 --> 16:38.622
I wanted to give you
your birthday present.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.624
[gentle music plays]

16:42.876 --> 16:43.877
Uh…

16:49.466 --> 16:51.343
[Kaya] It's, um…

16:53.345 --> 16:54.638
A giant pearl!

16:54.722 --> 16:56.223
So it is.

16:56.306 --> 16:58.934
[exhales] It wasn't easy to get either.

16:59.018 --> 17:02.187
It was guarded
by a giant goldfish monster.

17:02.271 --> 17:03.188
[gasps]

17:03.856 --> 17:07.192
I had to weather a storm,
my ship almost capsizing, to find it.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.485
Whoa!

17:09.236 --> 17:11.530
-Phew! [grunts]
-[giggles]

17:11.613 --> 17:13.157
I barely made landfall.

17:13.240 --> 17:16.577
-[gasps]
-Only it wasn't land I was on.

17:17.077 --> 17:18.746
It was… [sniffs]

17:18.829 --> 17:20.497
…a massive piece

17:21.957 --> 17:23.042
of goldfish shit.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.669
[laughs] Ew!

17:25.753 --> 17:27.713
[both laughing]

17:27.796 --> 17:29.757
[coughing]

17:30.924 --> 17:31.884
Kaya, are you okay?

17:32.384 --> 17:33.302
Tea.

17:50.694 --> 17:51.653
[clears throat]

17:52.529 --> 17:53.489
[exhales]

17:54.448 --> 17:56.158
How have you been feeling lately?

17:58.160 --> 17:59.369
No different really.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.874
When you've been sick as long as I have,
you get used to it.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.755
This tea is the only thing
that makes me feel better.

18:11.757 --> 18:14.968
That and your stories, of course.

18:17.137 --> 18:17.971
Well,

18:19.056 --> 18:22.601
I'll keep going on these grand adventures
as long as you want to hear 'em.

18:23.811 --> 18:25.771
I wouldn't miss them for the world.

18:29.566 --> 18:31.610
Why would anyone
even need this many clothes?

18:31.693 --> 18:33.737
[Nami] It's not about need
with these people.

18:33.821 --> 18:34.988
It's about want.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.200
What are we even supposed to wear?

18:38.700 --> 18:39.868
[Nami] Anything you want.

18:39.952 --> 18:43.705
When are you ever going to get
the opportunity to wear things this nice?

18:45.666 --> 18:46.500
Well?

18:47.626 --> 18:48.710
What do you think?

18:52.256 --> 18:53.799
You look like Nami.

19:00.806 --> 19:01.890
Hey, Zoro!

19:02.474 --> 19:03.517
What you gonna wear?

19:06.728 --> 19:07.855
Something black.

19:09.231 --> 19:10.190
[Nami] How edgy.

19:11.358 --> 19:14.611
Hey, does that butler
seem familiar to you guys?

19:14.695 --> 19:17.489
Yeah, I think he was
at the last dinner party I attended.

19:17.573 --> 19:19.324
I swear I've seen him somewhere.

19:26.123 --> 19:27.249
How's this?

19:27.833 --> 19:30.127
-Still Nami.
-I said I'm wearing black.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.004
I hate you guys.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.256
I feel kind of bad for Kaya.

19:36.633 --> 19:37.759
All this stuff.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.178
All this space.

19:40.179 --> 19:43.098
It's gotta make a person feel… lonely.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.309
[Nami] Rich people don't have
the same emotions we do.

19:45.392 --> 19:49.188
This stuff doesn't make her feel lonely.
It makes her feel important.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.733
[Luffy] Well, Usopp likes her.

19:52.816 --> 19:54.526
And she invited us to dinner.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.821
I'm sure we can work out
a way to get that ship.

19:57.905 --> 20:01.408
No way. Rich people don't stay rich
by giving things away.

20:03.243 --> 20:04.077
You want to bet?

20:07.372 --> 20:08.832
What are the terms?

20:11.960 --> 20:14.504
I bet I can convince Kaya
to give us that ship.

20:14.588 --> 20:15.714
And when you can't?

20:17.216 --> 20:18.467
We go with your plan.

20:19.384 --> 20:20.969
Steal one and move on.

20:23.472 --> 20:24.306
You're on.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.115
Nice.

20:44.076 --> 20:47.704
[Klahadore] Eighteen years old.
I can hardly believe it.

20:48.288 --> 20:50.582
You've grown into a fine young woman,
Miss Kaya.

20:51.458 --> 20:52.501
Oh, Klahadore.

21:00.550 --> 21:03.887
You know, I had nothing
when your parents took me in.

21:04.429 --> 21:05.973
When they passed, well,

21:06.473 --> 21:09.351
let's just say it has been an honor

21:09.434 --> 21:11.728
to repay their kindness, and yours,

21:11.812 --> 21:14.147
by serving you these past three years.

21:17.567 --> 21:18.902
You do so much for me.

21:19.903 --> 21:21.613
And not as a butler. As a friend.

21:24.741 --> 21:26.702
I don't know how I'll ever repay you.

21:27.202 --> 21:30.747
I know I can be
a tad overprotective at times,

21:30.831 --> 21:33.625
but it's just because
I couldn't bear to think

21:33.709 --> 21:36.295
what I would do
were something to happen to you.

21:37.379 --> 21:39.423
You could lighten up just a bit.

21:39.506 --> 21:40.507
[chuckles]

21:42.843 --> 21:43.677
[sighs]

21:44.386 --> 21:45.304
I shall try.

21:45.929 --> 21:47.889
That could be my birthday gift to you.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.057
[chuckles]

21:51.184 --> 21:53.186
[Buchi mumbling]

21:57.524 --> 21:58.692
Careful, you idiot!

22:00.360 --> 22:03.196
Sorry. It's a chef's reflex.

22:03.280 --> 22:04.948
You want to poison yourself?

22:05.657 --> 22:08.285
[Klahadore] And how are
the dinner preparations coming along?

22:08.368 --> 22:10.912
Uh… fine, sir.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.998
[mysterious music plays]

22:23.467 --> 22:24.301
Sham?

22:33.310 --> 22:34.269
What is this?

22:36.104 --> 22:38.190
I'm sorry, sir. It won't happen again.

22:38.774 --> 22:40.817
No. It won't.

22:42.277 --> 22:43.111
[gasps]

22:47.491 --> 22:52.079
Everything must be perfect,
tonight of all nights, hmm?

23:03.173 --> 23:04.174
[exhales]

23:12.641 --> 23:15.018
[military music plays]

23:15.102 --> 23:17.020
[Garp] Still your move, son.

23:18.814 --> 23:19.648
Sorry, sir.

23:33.662 --> 23:34.955
Game.

23:35.038 --> 23:36.706
You're overthinking things, son.

23:37.999 --> 23:40.460
You're too focused on not losing.

23:41.336 --> 23:43.880
You won't win wars
if you keep playing defensive.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.134
-I'm not very good, sir.
-[Garp] Nonsense.

23:47.717 --> 23:49.636
You just keep getting in your own way.

23:50.846 --> 23:51.680
Now,

23:52.931 --> 23:54.391
two minutes.

24:02.149 --> 24:03.150
Right. Your move.

24:04.151 --> 24:04.985
Do it.

24:06.403 --> 24:08.113
[adventurous music plays]

24:26.756 --> 24:27.591
I won!

24:30.969 --> 24:32.012
[Garp] That you did.

24:33.847 --> 24:35.474
Because you acted decisively.

24:35.557 --> 24:37.058
It's the same with pirates.

24:37.142 --> 24:39.394
Action is the only language
they understand,

24:39.478 --> 24:41.271
so we need to speak it louder.

24:42.564 --> 24:45.192
Especially with these young upstarts.

24:45.775 --> 24:48.653
They need a swift hand to put them
back in their place. Understood?

24:50.280 --> 24:52.782
-Yes, sir.
-Clear the board. We go again.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.120
[mysterious music plays]

24:57.204 --> 24:58.246
[Luffy] Ah.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.748
[indistinct chatter]

24:59.831 --> 25:00.665
[Luffy] Mmm.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.501
These are so good.

25:03.043 --> 25:03.919
I know, right?

25:04.002 --> 25:06.755
Reminds me of that one time
I slayed a dragon,

25:06.838 --> 25:10.050
cooked it over an open flame,
ate the whole thing myself.

25:10.133 --> 25:11.760
-You ever had dragon?
-Nope.

25:12.260 --> 25:14.763
-Do you have dragon?
-Afraid we're fresh out.

25:15.680 --> 25:16.556
Oh well.

25:17.933 --> 25:20.894
Hey, Zoro. You gotta try this!

25:20.977 --> 25:21.811
Mmm.

25:21.895 --> 25:23.730
I've got all I need right here.

25:30.862 --> 25:33.823
[Nami] So you manage
all of Kaya's finances?

25:33.907 --> 25:34.741
[man] Oh yes.

25:34.824 --> 25:39.287
I've handled her family's accounts,
both personal and professional, for years.

25:39.371 --> 25:40.205
Fascinating.

25:40.288 --> 25:43.333
You know, I've always been interested

25:43.416 --> 25:46.294
in learning about the intricacies
of the shipbuilding business.

25:46.378 --> 25:47.546
-Oh.
-[Klahadore clears throat]

25:49.422 --> 25:50.549
May I present…

25:54.344 --> 25:55.262
Miss Kaya.

26:09.526 --> 26:13.321
Kaya, you look absolutely radiant.

26:13.905 --> 26:17.158
Merry, I'm so glad you could make it.

26:17.242 --> 26:20.161
This is a milestone
I wouldn't miss for the world.

26:22.080 --> 26:23.915
Your parents would be so proud.

26:28.461 --> 26:32.757
-Nami, I love that dress on you.
-Thanks.

26:32.841 --> 26:35.969
It belonged to my mother.
It was one of her favorites.

26:36.970 --> 26:39.139
-Oh, I'm sorry. I--
-Not at all.

26:39.889 --> 26:42.726
I'm sure she would agree
it suits you splendidly.

26:49.024 --> 26:50.150
Have we met before?

26:52.694 --> 26:53.778
You look familiar.

26:56.698 --> 26:58.116
Highly doubtful, sir.

26:58.199 --> 26:59.659
Funky Bar?

27:00.160 --> 27:01.661
Mirror Ball Island?

27:03.580 --> 27:04.873
Funky Bar?

27:06.166 --> 27:10.086
Well, I can assure you I've never
patronized that type of establishment.

27:10.170 --> 27:13.131
Kaya, I wonder if I might have your ear?

27:13.214 --> 27:17.093
There are matters concerning
the transfer of ownership of the shipyard

27:17.177 --> 27:18.386
we need to discuss.

27:18.470 --> 27:22.599
Merry, dear friend,
it's always business with you.

27:22.682 --> 27:26.519
-[Merry sighs]
-[Klahadore] Tonight is about celebration.

27:26.603 --> 27:28.688
Shall we all move to the dining room?

27:30.231 --> 27:31.066
Yes!

27:31.691 --> 27:33.943
Oh! Oh, I'm so ready for this…

27:34.027 --> 27:35.612
[curious music plays]

27:46.122 --> 27:47.749
-[Zoro] Keep this coming.
-Uh.

27:52.420 --> 27:54.381
I'd love to try the fish tonight.

27:54.964 --> 27:57.842
I'm sorry, Miss Kaya,
but that is not possible.

27:57.926 --> 27:59.719
Maybe just a small piece?

28:00.303 --> 28:03.473
Now, you know that certain foods
can affect your constitution.

28:04.057 --> 28:06.601
Here, Buchi has prepared
your special soup.

28:12.774 --> 28:15.402
Kaya, it's your birthday.
You should be able to eat what you want.

28:15.485 --> 28:19.864
Miss Kaya's medical condition necessitates
that I closely monitor her dietary needs.

28:19.948 --> 28:21.491
Does it mean you also speak for her?

28:22.992 --> 28:24.202
I'll take her fish.

28:25.036 --> 28:26.204
[gulps]

28:27.497 --> 28:30.041
Luffy, isn't there something
that you wanted to talk to Kaya about?

28:30.125 --> 28:34.379
Oh, yes! Usopp told me
that you own the whole shipyard.

28:34.963 --> 28:37.841
Well, actually my parents
founded the shipyard,

28:37.924 --> 28:40.343
and Merry's been
running the business since…

28:40.427 --> 28:42.721
well, since they passed.

28:43.638 --> 28:46.057
But all of that's about to change.

28:47.267 --> 28:51.688
Tonight, at midnight,
I will become the sole owner.

28:52.522 --> 28:58.027
Ah. Well, that's great,
because we want to buy a ship from you.

28:59.571 --> 29:00.405
I see.

29:01.030 --> 29:04.409
-Usopp mentioned that you're sailors.
-Nope, not sailors.

29:04.492 --> 29:05.326
We're pirates.

29:07.162 --> 29:08.621
[Zoro] This ought to be good.

29:10.707 --> 29:11.875
-Pirates?
-[Luffy] Yep.

29:12.542 --> 29:14.002
We haven't sailed together for long,

29:14.085 --> 29:16.921
but we have already
defeated an evil clown,

29:17.005 --> 29:18.590
raided a Marine base,

29:18.673 --> 29:22.051
and taken down
a captain with an axe for a hand.

29:22.135 --> 29:24.471
These sound a lot
like your adventures, Usopp.

29:24.554 --> 29:27.640
[laughs] Yeah, that's… That's crazy.

29:27.724 --> 29:29.768
Oh yeah. And we're just getting started.

29:31.102 --> 29:34.314
What are you doing?
Get down from there at once!

29:34.397 --> 29:37.650
Being a pirate has been my dream
for as long as I can remember.

29:38.318 --> 29:40.862
And I'm finally making it a reality.

29:44.157 --> 29:47.994
We're heading out to the Grand Line,
where even more adventures await us.

29:48.578 --> 29:51.873
And at the end of the journey,
I'm gonna find the ultimate treasure,

29:52.540 --> 29:54.626
the One Piece, and become

29:56.002 --> 29:57.045
King of the Pirates.

29:57.545 --> 29:59.297
You're serious?

30:02.300 --> 30:03.551
[groans]

30:05.136 --> 30:05.970
[Luffy] Kaya,

30:06.638 --> 30:08.306
you have a beautiful ship out there.

30:08.389 --> 30:10.517
A caravel with a sheep figurehead.

30:10.600 --> 30:11.851
It spoke to me.

30:11.935 --> 30:14.354
That's the ship we need
to follow our dreams.

30:14.437 --> 30:17.357
I promise you,
we'll take care of it. Maintain it.

30:18.191 --> 30:20.568
Treat it like
any other member of our crew,

30:21.903 --> 30:23.404
because a ship is also a home.

30:23.988 --> 30:25.824
[Klahadore] That will be quite enough!

30:27.075 --> 30:30.203
I should've known Usopp
would bring riffraff to our doorstep.

30:31.246 --> 30:32.914
Klahadore, it's okay. I--

30:32.997 --> 30:34.999
[coughing]

30:35.875 --> 30:38.378
Now look what you've done.
You've upset Miss Kaya.

30:38.461 --> 30:41.172
-All of you, out of this house at once!
-No.

30:43.049 --> 30:45.635
It's late. Let them stay the night.

30:47.345 --> 30:48.972
As you wish, Miss Kaya,

30:49.055 --> 30:51.599
but they are out
first thing in the morning.

30:55.645 --> 30:57.355
[door opens]

30:57.438 --> 30:59.315
-That went pretty well.
-[door closes]

31:00.066 --> 31:00.900
Don't you think?

31:05.530 --> 31:07.657
[footsteps approaching]

31:08.741 --> 31:09.993
Vice-Admiral, I…

31:12.287 --> 31:15.206
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting something?

31:15.290 --> 31:18.626
No. You've just saved me
from getting beaten again.

31:20.003 --> 31:20.837
What is it?

31:21.546 --> 31:23.965
We spotted the wreckage
of an abandoned sloop.

31:26.342 --> 31:27.552
Found this on board.

31:29.012 --> 31:32.765
They couldn't have gotten far.
What's the nearest island to our location?

31:32.849 --> 31:33.933
It's Gecko Island, sir.

31:37.604 --> 31:40.231
[Garp] Gather a landing party
and make for shore.

31:41.524 --> 31:43.109
I want those pirates found.

31:43.192 --> 31:44.569
-Yes, sir.
-[Garp] Not you.

31:45.194 --> 31:46.029
Him.

31:46.112 --> 31:46.946
[both] What?!

31:47.780 --> 31:51.910
Your position as senior cadet
has proven unwarranted.

31:51.993 --> 31:54.621
Nepotism can only get you so far.

31:57.123 --> 31:59.250
This is your chance
to show me what you've got, cadet.

32:01.753 --> 32:02.587
Don't waste it.

32:03.421 --> 32:04.255
Yes, sir.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.383
[suspenseful music plays]

32:26.319 --> 32:27.362
[sighs]

32:27.445 --> 32:28.655
[gasps] Heavens!

32:29.572 --> 32:31.699
Are you trying to give me a fright?

32:31.783 --> 32:32.784
[Klahadore] So sorry.

32:32.867 --> 32:34.077
I tend to be

32:35.244 --> 32:37.538
light on my feet.

32:37.622 --> 32:40.166
I must speak with Miss Kaya immediately.

32:40.249 --> 32:44.337
This whole notion of transferring
the shipbuilding business to you

32:44.420 --> 32:47.131
is highly unusual, to say the least.

32:47.215 --> 32:49.217
I have run this estate
for Miss Kaya for years,

32:49.300 --> 32:50.843
so it is only natural

32:50.927 --> 32:54.889
that she should ask me to run
the family business until she's ready.

32:54.973 --> 32:57.308
I would like to discuss the matter
with Miss Kaya.

32:57.392 --> 33:00.520
These are our wishes, Merry.

33:00.603 --> 33:02.313
Then she can tell me herself.

33:02.397 --> 33:04.899
That young woman has been through enough,

33:04.983 --> 33:07.777
and I won't let anyone
take advantage of her.

33:07.860 --> 33:09.821
[suspenseful music continues]

33:09.904 --> 33:11.531
[gasps] How did you…

33:18.162 --> 33:19.163
[gasps]

33:21.207 --> 33:22.583
[yelps]

33:23.501 --> 33:24.669
[yelps]

33:25.670 --> 33:26.838
[yelps]

33:30.800 --> 33:31.718
Klahadore?

33:33.094 --> 33:35.096
I won't stand for this any longer.

33:37.890 --> 33:38.808
[gasps]

33:42.645 --> 33:43.479
[knives clang]

33:43.563 --> 33:45.565
[sinister music plays]

34:00.288 --> 34:01.581
[gasps]

34:04.459 --> 34:07.003
Is this the best way
to ask for an autograph?

34:07.503 --> 34:10.506
I mean, sheesh! Fans have gotten so toxic.

34:13.634 --> 34:15.094
All right, what do you want?

34:15.803 --> 34:17.346
Tickets to the show?

34:17.430 --> 34:20.308
I can get you house seats. They're pricey.

34:20.391 --> 34:21.517
-[thud]
-[gasps]

34:23.394 --> 34:27.648
[pirate] Oh, I'm no fan of yours.

34:33.112 --> 34:34.197
[growls]

34:34.739 --> 34:35.948
[snarls]

34:37.158 --> 34:37.992
Arlong?

34:39.619 --> 34:42.038
[Arlong] I run things here
in the East Blue.

34:43.456 --> 34:47.251
I'm here to remind you
of your place in the food chain.

34:50.296 --> 34:54.467
You pull a job in my seas,
you gotta pay tribute.

34:54.967 --> 34:59.055
But, Arlong, baby,
you don't gotta worry about me.

34:59.138 --> 35:02.183
I'm small potatoes.
Pirating's more of a side gig.

35:04.811 --> 35:06.062
[clicking tongue]

35:07.772 --> 35:10.608
Kuroobi tells me
you ransacked Orange Town.

35:10.691 --> 35:12.318
[gasps] Ransacked?

35:12.401 --> 35:14.445
You should've seen the place
before I got there, okay?

35:14.529 --> 35:15.738
It was a real fixer-upper.

35:16.489 --> 35:18.950
You bore me, clown. [growls]

35:19.033 --> 35:21.369
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Wait. Wait.

35:23.704 --> 35:26.541
You know who's out there
really disrespecting you?

35:26.624 --> 35:30.753
It's that little rubber prick
in a straw hat. Goes by the name of Luffy.

35:32.505 --> 35:34.382
-Never heard of him.
-[Buggy choking]

35:34.465 --> 35:37.677
He just knocked over
a Marine base in Shells Town.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.804
And then he stole a map of the Grand Line,

35:39.887 --> 35:42.640
and now he's talking shit
about finding the One Piece.

35:45.017 --> 35:46.310
[Buggy coughing]

35:47.645 --> 35:48.813
[Arlong] The One Piece.

35:49.689 --> 35:55.695
[chuckles] An excuse for humans
to spread their filth across the seas.

35:56.529 --> 36:00.533
Listen, why don't you let me live,

36:00.616 --> 36:05.121
and then I help you find Luffy?

36:07.623 --> 36:09.333
Ah. Ah. Ah.

36:13.421 --> 36:16.424
And how do you plan to do that?

36:18.217 --> 36:21.137
I've got eyes and ears everywhere.

36:22.722 --> 36:24.724
[both laughing]

36:28.686 --> 36:29.645
[gasps]

36:31.480 --> 36:33.482
[mysterious music plays]

36:41.115 --> 36:42.074
Hey, Zoro!

36:42.158 --> 36:43.659
Sh! Shut up.

36:51.876 --> 36:53.711
You always carry those swords with you?

36:53.794 --> 36:56.297
Wherever I go, the Wado Ichimonji goes.

36:57.840 --> 37:00.551
-Where are you going anyways?
-I'm looking for a drink.

37:01.344 --> 37:02.678
This place is a maze.

37:06.724 --> 37:07.683
How about you?

37:10.061 --> 37:11.103
Midnight snack.

37:13.189 --> 37:14.023
Of course.

37:16.943 --> 37:19.570
Come on.
We'll follow my nose to the kitchen.

37:50.893 --> 37:53.104
[footsteps approaching]

38:11.163 --> 38:12.581
-[Kaya] Nami?
-[gasps]

38:14.000 --> 38:16.085
What are you doing?
Is everything all right?

38:16.168 --> 38:20.172
Sorry, this house is so massive.
I was just trying to find the bathroom.

38:21.966 --> 38:23.175
With a pillowcase?

38:29.807 --> 38:33.185
So… you are a pirate after all.

38:35.062 --> 38:36.689
I hate pirates.

38:38.190 --> 38:39.358
But I am who I am.

38:41.027 --> 38:41.902
And

38:42.611 --> 38:44.113
I won't apologize for that.

38:44.196 --> 38:47.867
To be honest, I find some of the decor
to be a bit gaudy.

38:47.950 --> 38:49.577
I'd prefer to donate it to charity.

38:49.660 --> 38:51.162
I'm not charity.

38:51.245 --> 38:53.122
No, of course not.

38:53.831 --> 38:56.959
I simply meant
what's the point in having so much

38:57.043 --> 38:59.128
if you can't share it with others?

38:59.211 --> 39:01.088
Like those in need. Family.

39:02.548 --> 39:03.424
Friends.

39:03.507 --> 39:04.759
So we're friends now?

39:06.177 --> 39:07.470
You don't even know me.

39:08.346 --> 39:11.015
Usopp does, and that's a start.

39:11.515 --> 39:13.517
[gentle music plays]

39:22.902 --> 39:24.028
So what do we do now?

39:25.363 --> 39:27.031
Have a sleepover? Do each other's makeup?

39:27.114 --> 39:28.032
[chuckles]

39:28.115 --> 39:29.867
[coughing]

39:31.452 --> 39:32.578
Kaya, are you okay?

39:37.416 --> 39:38.376
Not you too.

39:39.543 --> 39:40.378
What?

39:41.253 --> 39:43.214
[Kaya] Everyone's so careful around me.

39:43.297 --> 39:45.383
Like one wrong move and I'll break.

39:46.842 --> 39:48.135
I don't want your pity.

39:48.928 --> 39:50.137
Well, you won't get it then.

40:00.940 --> 40:02.149
Couldn't sleep either, huh?

40:02.233 --> 40:03.109
[chuckles]

40:03.192 --> 40:04.610
Not after that dinner.

40:09.031 --> 40:11.075
I hope I didn't get you
in trouble with Kaya.

40:11.617 --> 40:13.285
Sometimes I get carried away.

40:13.369 --> 40:15.830
Oh, no. It was worth it.

40:15.913 --> 40:18.165
Seeing that look on Klahadore's face.

40:18.999 --> 40:19.834
[laughs]

40:21.627 --> 40:23.379
I thought his head was gonna explode.

40:26.424 --> 40:30.636
All that stuff true that you said?
About the clown and the axe-hand guy?

40:31.470 --> 40:32.680
Mm-hmm.

40:32.763 --> 40:33.597
Every word.

40:34.432 --> 40:37.852
I mean, they're not as exciting
as your adventures.

40:40.271 --> 40:41.355
Yeah.

40:42.565 --> 40:45.526
And the One Piece,
are you really going after that?

40:46.277 --> 40:47.111
Yep.

40:47.695 --> 40:49.655
I'm gonna be the one to find it too.

40:51.657 --> 40:52.533
Man!

40:53.909 --> 40:55.453
I wish I could do that.

40:56.912 --> 40:57.746
But

40:58.706 --> 40:59.665
I can't leave.

41:01.417 --> 41:02.668
Kaya needs me.

41:03.752 --> 41:06.297
-Is she your girlfriend or something?
-What?

41:07.548 --> 41:08.591
Oh.

41:08.674 --> 41:09.967
Um… [chuckles]

41:10.801 --> 41:12.178
Usopp and me? No. No.

41:12.845 --> 41:16.390
We've known each other for years.
Ever since his mother died.

41:17.558 --> 41:21.562
He didn't have anybody, so my parents
gave him a job at the shipyard.

41:22.146 --> 41:23.481
He likes to come around

41:23.564 --> 41:28.903
and tell me all about his brave exploits
and grand adventures.

41:30.696 --> 41:32.156
And truth is,

41:32.239 --> 41:33.699
they make me feel better.

41:34.617 --> 41:38.537
She's more like… my best friend.

41:40.164 --> 41:44.502
Her parents died a few years ago,
and she… took it pretty hard, and…

41:45.628 --> 41:47.755
and then she got sick on top of that.

41:50.758 --> 41:53.594
I just want to be there for her, you know?

41:55.721 --> 41:57.139
[Nami] Your parents,

41:57.223 --> 41:58.557
what happened to them?

42:03.270 --> 42:04.104
They, um…

42:06.649 --> 42:07.691
They died at sea.

42:13.113 --> 42:16.033
All these years
and it still takes my breath away.

42:18.369 --> 42:20.871
I couldn't even
go through their belongings.

42:21.789 --> 42:26.961
Just… locked up the memories
in the East Wing, where their bedroom was.

42:31.715 --> 42:32.800
I'm sorry.

42:37.513 --> 42:39.598
Have you ever lost anyone close to you?

42:41.934 --> 42:42.768
No.

42:45.396 --> 42:46.230
I'm jealous.

42:46.897 --> 42:47.773
[scoffs]

42:47.856 --> 42:48.983
Said the rich girl.

42:49.066 --> 42:50.109
[chuckles]

42:51.193 --> 42:54.154
You're not very good
at this friends thing, are you?

42:55.114 --> 42:56.448
[chuckles]

42:56.532 --> 42:58.659
[both laugh]

43:00.286 --> 43:02.162
No, I guess I'm not.

43:02.246 --> 43:03.956
[both laughing]

43:04.039 --> 43:05.207
[Usopp] She's gorgeous,

43:05.916 --> 43:07.376
and she's super smart.

43:07.876 --> 43:09.670
She has the best laugh.

43:10.337 --> 43:11.839
But, I mean,

43:13.382 --> 43:17.595
you don't think
she, like, like likes me, do you?

43:20.347 --> 43:21.765
You're asking the wrong guy.

43:21.849 --> 43:24.059
Okay. But if you were Kaya,
would you like me?

43:24.143 --> 43:25.060
I already like you.

43:25.978 --> 43:27.813
Okay, that's not what I… I…

43:28.564 --> 43:29.773
Never mind.

43:34.862 --> 43:35.738
Wow.

43:36.780 --> 43:38.073
You're a great shot!

43:38.657 --> 43:41.994
Got it from my dad.
He's a notorious pirate.

43:42.077 --> 43:43.746
I don't really remember him that well,

43:43.829 --> 43:46.790
'cause he left for a life at sea
when I was just a baby,

43:46.874 --> 43:48.709
but he'll be back one day.

43:50.377 --> 43:51.253

43:51.337 --> 43:52.421
Yasopp the Great!

43:54.465 --> 43:55.299
Yasopp?

43:57.259 --> 43:58.260
He's your dad?

43:58.344 --> 44:00.554
-Yeah. Why? You heard of him?
-[Luffy] Heard of him?

44:01.180 --> 44:03.307
I know him! I… [chuckles]

44:03.390 --> 44:05.100
He's a part of Shanks' crew!

44:06.435 --> 44:07.895
Wait. You know my dad?

44:07.978 --> 44:10.314
Yeah, yeah, I do! He's the best.

44:10.397 --> 44:12.441
Always made time for some pirate wisdom.

44:12.524 --> 44:13.734
So you guys, like,

44:14.818 --> 44:15.694
hung out?

44:16.904 --> 44:17.821
Yeah.

44:19.281 --> 44:20.115
That's

44:21.283 --> 44:22.117
cool.

44:22.993 --> 44:25.871
If you're gonna talk about feelings,
I'm really gonna need a drink.

44:26.455 --> 44:28.457
Uh, there's a wine cellar in the basement.

44:29.291 --> 44:30.793
Why didn't you tell me that before?

44:38.717 --> 44:39.551
You coming?

44:44.139 --> 44:44.973
Nope.

44:49.269 --> 44:50.854
Got everything I need right here.

44:52.106 --> 44:54.108
[ominous music plays]

45:12.292 --> 45:14.169
[sighs] Now we're talking.

45:25.848 --> 45:28.016
I'm pretty sure
they keep the good stuff over here.

45:28.100 --> 45:29.184
Oh!

45:29.810 --> 45:31.145
[panting]

45:34.314 --> 45:35.858
Zoro. Zoro?

45:36.525 --> 45:38.110
It's Mer-- It's Merry. He's…

45:38.610 --> 45:39.778
He's dea--

45:40.279 --> 45:41.238
[Usopp panting]

45:47.453 --> 45:48.787
[Zoro] Five blades.

45:49.747 --> 45:51.331
I think I've seen this before.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.918
Well, well, well.

45:56.086 --> 46:00.299
It appears
we have some rats in our cellar.

46:00.382 --> 46:02.009
[suspenseful music plays]

46:09.057 --> 46:10.058
[Zoro] Those blades.

46:11.852 --> 46:14.062
I knew I'd seen your face somewhere.

46:15.898 --> 46:17.191
On a wanted poster.

46:18.066 --> 46:21.695
You're Kuro,
captain of the Black Cat Pirates.

46:31.497 --> 46:33.791
-Wait, Klahadore's a pirate?
-A dead one.

46:33.874 --> 46:36.001
They say you were killed
by Axe-Hand Morgan.

46:36.084 --> 46:37.461
A clever ruse.

46:38.253 --> 46:41.507
One that imbecile's ego
helped me perpetuate.

46:41.590 --> 46:43.133
And as you'll soon learn,

46:44.468 --> 46:47.137
no one interferes in my plans.

46:49.973 --> 46:52.142
So I will collect a bounty tonight.

47:01.109 --> 47:02.069
Uh…

[ominous music plays]

47:46.613 --> 47:50.868
Dispose of the bodies.
Outside of the house this time.

47:51.618 --> 47:53.328
No trace left behind.

47:53.412 --> 47:55.414
What about Usopp? He got away.

47:56.331 --> 47:57.207
[Kuro] No matter.

47:57.291 --> 47:58.709
But he could ruin the plan.

47:58.792 --> 48:02.880
Let him say whatever he wants.
No one will believe him anyway.

48:14.933 --> 48:17.185
"Oh, Usopp got away." Ooh.

48:19.396 --> 48:20.230
Go on.

48:25.694 --> 48:28.322
Why don't you join me
for breakfast tomorrow?

48:28.947 --> 48:30.115
Your friends too.

48:30.991 --> 48:33.243
We can discuss a deal for the caravel.

48:34.786 --> 48:35.621
I'd like that.

48:39.958 --> 48:42.252
This may not be my place,

48:42.794 --> 48:47.049
but don't let Klahadore,
or anyone for that matter, run your life.

48:48.091 --> 48:49.343
You're stronger than you think.

48:51.595 --> 48:52.971
I appreciate that.

48:55.891 --> 48:56.892
Good night, Nami.

48:58.602 --> 48:59.436
Good night.

49:03.774 --> 49:05.067
Don't forget your pillow.

and half as smart.

of such nice swords though.

Someone, help!

Help me! Please open up!

I swear it's the truth.
There really are pirates!

-It's really not funny.

-I've heard enough about the pirates.
-[Usopp] You know I'm right. Let me go!

51:20.327 --> 51:24.122
He's at it again, Banchina.
Going on and on about pirates coming.

Get hold of your kid
before he gets himself in serious trouble.

51:29.336 --> 51:30.837
Hey! Let me go.

51:34.549 --> 51:35.383
Usopp,

51:36.218 --> 51:38.929
you can't keep telling people
that pirates are coming.

51:39.012 --> 51:40.055
But they are coming.

51:40.138 --> 51:43.975
And Dad's coming with them.
He'll be home soon, I promise.

51:45.352 --> 51:47.062
That's wonderful news, Usopp.

51:47.729 --> 51:50.398
But you do know
that even if he doesn't come--

51:50.482 --> 51:53.610
He will! I know he will.
Then you'll start feeling better.

51:55.153 --> 51:55.987
You're right.

51:57.531 --> 51:58.740
Of course you're right.
