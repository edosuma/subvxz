WEBVTT

00:05.641 --> 00:09.177
Guess who's going to
the Zalien convention!

00:10.213 --> 00:11.179
Dez got us tickets.

00:11.181 --> 00:13.181
He was in line for three days.

00:13.183 --> 00:16.952
I didn't sleep, shower or brush
my teeth the whole time.

00:16.954 --> 00:17.954
Can you believe it?

00:19.623 --> 00:20.956
Yes.

00:20.958 --> 00:22.324
Yes, I can.

00:23.793 --> 00:26.962
The best part is I get to
take my four favorite people.

00:26.964 --> 00:30.332
One for me, one for Austin,
one for Trish, and of course,

00:30.334 --> 00:31.900
the brilliant and beautiful...

00:31.902 --> 00:34.536
- Aw, Dez...
- Carrie.

00:34.538 --> 00:35.837
Carrie?

00:35.839 --> 00:39.741
But she can't go because she's teaching
a self-defense/ country dance class.

00:39.743 --> 00:41.943
It's called "tae Kwon do-si-do."

00:41.945 --> 00:43.311
Yee-haw...

00:43.313 --> 00:44.379
Hyah!

00:45.948 --> 00:49.451
Since Carrie can't go, I have to
move on to my fifth-favorite person.

00:49.453 --> 00:51.453
Ally...

00:51.455 --> 00:54.289
Would your dad like to go
to the convention with us?

00:54.291 --> 00:55.791
My dad?!

00:55.793 --> 00:57.292
No. He's out of town.

00:57.294 --> 00:58.727
Aw, man.

00:58.729 --> 01:00.462
Well, on to my sixth-favorite.

01:01.497 --> 01:03.331
Ally...

01:03.333 --> 01:05.567
Would you like to go to
the convention with us?

01:05.569 --> 01:09.704
As sweet as that invitation was, I
don't wanna spend my Saturday doing

01:09.706 --> 01:10.906
nerdy, boring stuff.

01:11.767 --> 01:14.543
This coming from the girl that
goes to cloud-watching club.

01:14.545 --> 01:16.545
Hey! We had a great
turnout last week.

01:16.547 --> 01:18.513
Both of us showed up.

01:18.515 --> 01:20.916
Thanks again, Austin.

01:20.918 --> 01:22.584
No problem.

01:22.586 --> 01:24.286
I like cloud-watching club...

01:24.288 --> 01:26.254
Ever since I learned to
sleep with my eyes open.

01:26.256 --> 01:28.523
- What?
- Nothing.

01:28.525 --> 01:29.958
Ally, just come to the
convention with us.

01:29.960 --> 01:31.560
- Please?
- It'll be cool.

01:31.562 --> 01:33.562
Please don't make me
invite my aunt edna.

01:33.564 --> 01:35.363
She's no fun since she
got out of prison.

01:37.700 --> 01:39.935
Okay, fine. I'll go.

01:39.937 --> 01:44.272
Just please don't make me wear
some weird Zalien costume.

01:44.274 --> 01:47.576
I promise. We won't make
you dress up as a Zalien.

01:48.744 --> 01:52.414
A Xanthian Princess
is so much better.

01:52.416 --> 01:54.282
High five!

01:56.000 --> 02:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:54.944 --> 02:56.945
- Whoa-ho-ho!
- Whoa!

02:56.947 --> 03:00.048
Hey, guys, just because
I have six arms,

03:00.050 --> 03:01.550
doesn't mean I wanna
carry all your junk.

03:01.552 --> 03:02.951
- Ooh, sorry.
- Sorry.

03:04.420 --> 03:06.988
And tell me again why we
have to wear these outfits?

03:06.990 --> 03:08.957
'Cause part of the fun of
coming to these conventions

03:08.959 --> 03:10.992
is getting to play your
favorite character.

03:10.994 --> 03:12.994
Yeah, like me. I'm Veloptu...

03:12.996 --> 03:15.096
Princess Starna's bodyguard.

03:15.998 --> 03:17.365
Veloptu can't be tamed.

03:17.367 --> 03:18.967
He's like a wild stallion.

03:18.969 --> 03:20.135
Literally. I'm half-horse.

03:23.573 --> 03:25.907
You have to fully commit
to your character, Ally.

03:25.909 --> 03:27.842
Let me see your best
Princess Starna.

03:27.844 --> 03:28.844
Ahem.

03:28.869 --> 03:32.844
Hello! I'm Princess Starna.

03:35.484 --> 03:38.019
Ally, please don't ruin
this by being yourself.

03:38.955 --> 03:40.956
Princess Starna is
fierce and angry.

03:40.958 --> 03:43.959
It's not enough to have the six
arms and her fake bushy eyebrows.

03:43.961 --> 03:45.627
My eyebrows aren't fake.

03:45.629 --> 03:46.962
That's the angry look!

03:46.964 --> 03:48.964
Yeah...

03:48.966 --> 03:51.733
I'm not really feeling this
whole role-playing thing.

03:51.735 --> 03:52.901
Oh my gosh!

03:52.903 --> 03:54.536
You're like the perfect
Princess Starna.

03:54.538 --> 03:57.172
Can we take your picture?
You are so beautiful!

03:57.174 --> 03:59.975
Beautiful?

03:59.977 --> 04:02.944
You know, maybe this role-playing
thing's not so bad after all.

04:02.946 --> 04:05.113
- Snap away, nerds.
- Yes.

04:09.952 --> 04:14.956
Oh, one for you, one
for you, one for you.

04:14.958 --> 04:17.591
Can you believe all this
cool Zalien merchandise?

04:17.594 --> 04:18.793
What are you eating?

04:18.795 --> 04:20.962
Brain jerky. The Zaliens love
eating brains, because they're...

04:20.964 --> 04:22.597
half-zombies, half-aliens.

04:22.599 --> 04:24.933
No, because they're
half-zombie, half...

04:24.935 --> 04:26.201
Oh. Yeah, you're right.

04:27.136 --> 04:29.104
I like the Zalien eggs they're
selling at that booth.

04:29.106 --> 04:31.206
They have goo
inside you can eat.

04:33.142 --> 04:35.110
Ugh! Does that even taste good?

04:35.112 --> 04:36.544
Nope!

04:39.081 --> 04:40.715
Hey, check out these guys.

04:40.717 --> 04:42.017
Their costumes are awesome.

04:43.987 --> 04:45.954
Princess Starna!

04:45.956 --> 04:48.456
We are humbled by your presence.

04:48.458 --> 04:49.958
I am Zip.

04:49.960 --> 04:51.493
And I am Zilch.

04:51.495 --> 04:55.497
May the rings of Magalar bring you good
fortune and many tentacled children.

04:59.002 --> 05:00.835
- Uh, thank you?
- Heh.

05:01.872 --> 05:04.005
Watch your language.

05:04.007 --> 05:06.741
There are young
galoopters present.

05:07.877 --> 05:12.047
I can't believe a woman of your
upbringing would talk like that.

05:12.049 --> 05:13.848
If you weren't the
Princess, I'd...

05:13.850 --> 05:15.183
Hey! Show some respect.

05:15.185 --> 05:16.217
You wanna get hoofed?

05:19.055 --> 05:23.158
Sorry, the Princess is a little
rusty on her Zalien vocabulary.

05:23.160 --> 05:24.280
I guess you could say she...

05:27.931 --> 05:29.564
And she's a little tired.

05:29.566 --> 05:31.499
It was a long flight
from Xanthia.

05:31.501 --> 05:32.967
We understand.

05:32.969 --> 05:37.172
We arrived yesterday on our mission
to retrieve the Zalien prince egg!

05:37.174 --> 05:39.240
But of course you know
that, your highness.

05:42.846 --> 05:46.514
Your un-hatched cousin is
next in line for the throne.

05:46.516 --> 05:48.683
Oh! Yeah, I knew that.

05:48.685 --> 05:51.119
Cousin Eggbert. Love that guy.

05:51.121 --> 05:55.123
Our king sent the prince Egg to earth
to protect him from the bounty hunters.

05:55.125 --> 05:57.726
Unfortunately, our
egg handler Zed

05:57.728 --> 06:00.228
hid the egg and forgot where
he put the dang thing!

06:00.230 --> 06:02.731
Zed's the slow one of the group.

06:02.733 --> 06:04.899
Yeah, we have one of those too.

06:04.901 --> 06:06.634
It's him.

06:06.636 --> 06:10.271
Luckily, our G.P.S. Located
the egg, in this building.

06:10.273 --> 06:12.107
We still haven't been
able to find it.

06:12.109 --> 06:15.977
And even if we did, we wouldn't
be able to get back to Xytrax!

06:15.979 --> 06:17.779
Yeah, our shuttle won't start.

06:17.781 --> 06:19.047
There's just this blinking...

06:19.049 --> 06:20.048
"Check engine"...

06:20.050 --> 06:21.116
Light.

06:22.251 --> 06:26.054
We've sent word to our repair crew
and are waiting for their arrival.

06:26.056 --> 06:27.322
Wait!

06:27.324 --> 06:28.923
Are you the mechanics?

06:28.925 --> 06:30.091
You bet!

06:32.128 --> 06:33.261
What are you doing?

06:33.263 --> 06:35.130
Uh, it's called role-playing.

06:35.132 --> 06:36.598
Watch and learn.

06:36.600 --> 06:39.934
Where's the transportation
vessel located?

06:39.936 --> 06:41.269
Oh, it's in the parking lot.

06:44.840 --> 06:48.176
If their costumes are this good,
their ship must be awesome!

06:48.178 --> 06:49.277
Let's go check it out.

06:52.681 --> 06:54.983
I'll stay here and
protect you, Princess.

06:54.985 --> 06:55.984
Look out!

06:55.986 --> 06:58.286
It's the evil Zolofrox
dressed as a janitor.

06:58.288 --> 07:00.155
And he has a laser stick.

07:03.993 --> 07:07.762
I'm pretty sure that's just a
janitor dressed as a janitor.

07:09.098 --> 07:10.331
Sorry.

07:24.246 --> 07:27.015
- Whoa!
- This shuttle is amazing!

07:27.017 --> 07:28.983
It's not the fastest
of the fleet,

07:28.985 --> 07:32.086
but it does get like 30
light-years per gallon.

07:32.088 --> 07:33.988
- Hmm.
- Tinted windows.

07:33.990 --> 07:34.989
Sweet.

07:34.991 --> 07:35.990
They're custom.

07:35.992 --> 07:37.659
Lethusian chicks dig 'em.

07:37.661 --> 07:39.861
Ooh...

07:39.863 --> 07:41.162
Whoa!

07:41.164 --> 07:44.332
This is just like the mission
control board in the Zalien movies.

07:44.334 --> 07:47.135
Oh, yes, the movies.

07:47.137 --> 07:51.105
They are very entertaining,
but not very accurate.

07:51.107 --> 07:54.275
Everyone knows that Zaliens
don't have two hearts.

07:54.277 --> 07:55.410
They have three!

07:57.047 --> 07:58.980
Wow!

07:58.982 --> 08:00.915
This ship is so detailed.

08:00.917 --> 08:03.351
These guys really take their
role-playing seriously.

08:03.353 --> 08:05.420
Maybe too seriously.

08:06.989 --> 08:08.790
You don't think they're
real Zaliens, do you?!

08:08.792 --> 08:12.694
Yes, they're real and I
have a huge crush on you.

08:15.164 --> 08:16.931
Dez, they're not real.

08:19.134 --> 08:21.336
You guys hungry?
We're about to eat.

08:21.338 --> 08:23.705
Zilch, you don't mind, do you?

08:23.707 --> 08:24.706
Help yourself.

08:24.708 --> 08:26.975
Zalien brain suck!

08:36.186 --> 08:38.019
Okay, they're real.

08:38.020 --> 08:40.188
I was right. Aah!

08:40.190 --> 08:41.188
Wait.

08:41.191 --> 08:42.551
That means you have
a crush on me!

08:51.333 --> 08:54.469
So, when did you realize
you had a crush on me?

08:54.471 --> 08:57.138
I don't have a crush on you!

08:57.140 --> 09:00.808
We gotta get outta here before they
find out we're not really Zaliens!

09:00.810 --> 09:02.176
What's the worst
that could happen?

09:02.178 --> 09:06.848
Um, they're zombie aliens, which
means they eat human brains.

09:06.850 --> 09:08.016
We have brains!

09:08.018 --> 09:09.150
Or at least I do.

09:09.152 --> 09:10.151
Come on, let's go.

09:10.153 --> 09:13.354
We only have one earth day to
find the prince Egg and get home.

09:13.356 --> 09:16.424
You need to fix the ship now.

09:16.426 --> 09:18.993
- Uh...
- Of... of course.

09:18.995 --> 09:22.063
Just let me check the
crystal transponder.

09:26.540 --> 09:29.203
You just blew up the
eighth moon of zarkania.

09:29.205 --> 09:31.306
You should really
label these buttons.

09:31.308 --> 09:33.274
You're an incompetent...

09:33.276 --> 09:34.475
You're fired!

09:34.477 --> 09:36.744
Eh, I'm used to it.

09:36.746 --> 09:38.012
Wait! This should do the trick.

09:39.015 --> 09:41.182
<i>Shuttle will self-destruct</i>

09:41.184 --> 09:42.951
<i>in 10...</i>

09:42.953 --> 09:44.819
<i>- Nine...
- Seriously, why is nothing labeled?!</i>

09:44.821 --> 09:46.287
Are you trying to blow us up?!

09:46.289 --> 09:48.256
<i>Six...</i>

09:48.258 --> 09:50.278
Self-destruct cancelled.

09:50.309 --> 09:53.261
You guys are Zalien
mechanics, aren't you?

09:53.263 --> 09:55.096
Uh, yeah.

09:55.098 --> 09:57.165
We graduated from...

09:57.167 --> 10:00.001
Oh, really? Do you know Sheila?

10:00.003 --> 10:02.470
Tall, green, eats
a lot of brains?

10:02.472 --> 10:03.871
Love her.

10:08.010 --> 10:11.045
Dez, we need to fix this
ship or we're Zalien food.

10:11.047 --> 10:12.380
Wait a minute.

10:12.382 --> 10:14.515
They had to fix the
shuttle in "Zalien 13."

10:14.517 --> 10:17.018
Too bad I missed that scene
'cause I was in the bathroom.

10:17.020 --> 10:18.319
Darn you, small bladder!

10:21.091 --> 10:22.924
- Yay!
- Yay!

10:22.926 --> 10:23.976
You fixed our ship.

10:24.007 --> 10:26.257
- Who's the incompetent...
- Now?

10:32.034 --> 10:34.902
As much fun as I had
being Princess Starna,

10:34.904 --> 10:37.205
I can't wait for us to go
cloud watching tomorrow.

10:38.208 --> 10:40.475
Uh, that cloud's beautiful.

10:40.477 --> 10:42.377
I wasn't sleeping
with my eyes open.

10:47.883 --> 10:49.484
I can't believe
what just happened!

10:49.486 --> 10:51.886
You know those losers
in Zalien costumes?!

10:51.888 --> 10:55.056
Mm, you're gonna have to
be a little more specific.

10:55.058 --> 10:57.959
Zip and Zilch are real Zaliens!

10:57.961 --> 11:00.962
They're here to find the lost prince
Egg and Trish has a huge crush on me!

11:00.964 --> 11:02.096
That's not true.

11:02.098 --> 11:03.164
I mean the part about the crush.

11:03.166 --> 11:04.532
The Zaliens are real.

11:04.534 --> 11:07.201
Don't be ridiculous.
Zaliens aren't real.

11:07.203 --> 11:09.337
They're just characters
from a movie.

11:09.339 --> 11:10.571
Hey.

11:10.573 --> 11:12.173
You forgot to fill
out a work report.

11:12.175 --> 11:14.208
Uh, yeah.

11:14.210 --> 11:16.344
We weren't running
away from you in fear.

11:16.346 --> 11:19.147
We were, uh, taking
our lunch break.

11:19.149 --> 11:20.448
Oh...

11:20.450 --> 11:23.151
A very tasty-looking
lunch indeed.

11:23.153 --> 11:25.053
Human brains are the best.

11:25.055 --> 11:26.854
I think I'll take the blond one.

11:26.856 --> 11:28.122
I'll take the brown-haired one.

11:28.124 --> 11:31.526
No! We weren't gonna
eat their brains.

11:31.528 --> 11:33.361
I think they expired
a little while ago.

11:33.363 --> 11:35.096
Don't wanna get you sick.

11:35.098 --> 11:39.167
Nonsense! Humans are good way
beyond their expiration date.

11:39.169 --> 11:41.202
It's fine, Trish.

11:41.204 --> 11:43.137
Go ahead, eat our brains.

11:43.139 --> 11:44.439
Ohh...

11:44.441 --> 11:46.607
Zalien brain...

11:46.609 --> 11:48.443
You don't wanna
eat their brains.

11:48.445 --> 11:50.144
These two are famous humans.

11:50.146 --> 11:51.979
They're greatly admired
here on earth.

11:51.981 --> 11:54.615
Oh, are they world leaders?
Great scientists?

11:54.617 --> 11:56.551
Doctors who cure diseases?

11:56.553 --> 12:00.021
Nope, better. They
sing and dance.

12:00.023 --> 12:01.522
I don't get it.

12:01.524 --> 12:03.157
I'm still probably
gonna eat them.

12:03.159 --> 12:04.659
You can't!

12:04.661 --> 12:06.194
They're special.

12:06.196 --> 12:08.096
They play music that
makes people happy.

12:08.098 --> 12:09.597
Hmm, I don't know.

12:09.599 --> 12:11.432
I'm still probably
gonna eat them.

12:11.434 --> 12:13.067
Wait!

12:13.069 --> 12:16.070
We'll prove it to you. They
can put on a performance.

12:16.072 --> 12:18.339
Yeah! They can do a song for
you at the convention center.

12:18.341 --> 12:20.108
And you'll see that
they're worth saving.

12:20.110 --> 12:22.333
Fine. If they provide
adequate entertainment,

12:22.345 --> 12:24.579
they don't have to be the meal.

12:24.581 --> 12:26.681
We have to go back to the
convention center anyway

12:26.683 --> 12:28.216
to look for the prince egg.

12:28.218 --> 12:31.519
Okay, I'm all about
having Zalien fun,

12:31.521 --> 12:34.188
but I think you guys are taking
this a little too seriously.

12:34.190 --> 12:37.058
Yeah, we're not gonna perform
for a bunch of fanboys

12:37.060 --> 12:38.693
just 'cause you can't
stop role-playing.

12:38.695 --> 12:41.429
Zalien brain suck!

12:45.301 --> 12:47.368
Zaliens are real!

12:51.373 --> 12:53.307
That means they almost
really sucked my brain.

12:53.309 --> 12:57.178
Yeah, and now you have to perform
for them to save your lives!

12:57.180 --> 12:59.614
Austin, you have nothing
to worry about.

12:59.616 --> 13:02.116
You're an awesome
singer, a great dancer

13:02.118 --> 13:04.385
and you always put on
the most amazing shows.

13:04.387 --> 13:06.554
Ally, we're gonna miss you.

13:22.171 --> 13:24.172
- Are you nervous?
- Yeah.

13:24.174 --> 13:26.107
We have to perform like
our lives depend on it,

13:26.109 --> 13:27.575
because our lives depend on it.

13:27.577 --> 13:29.110
Break a leg, guys.

13:29.112 --> 13:30.244
Wait. Don't break a leg.

13:30.246 --> 13:31.312
They eat the weak.

13:32.447 --> 13:34.458
Look, you're either gonna
nail it, or you're gonna

13:34.489 --> 13:36.350
get your brain sucked out
by some angry aliens.

13:36.352 --> 13:38.486
The important thing
is that you have fun.

13:49.164 --> 13:52.033
This song is dedicated to
our friends from Xytrax.

13:52.035 --> 13:53.334
I hope you like it.

13:53.336 --> 13:55.269
I really really
hope you like it.

16:04.199 --> 16:07.134
That was more than
adequate, humans.

16:07.136 --> 16:10.438
Yes, we have decided it would
be unwise to suck your brains.

16:10.440 --> 16:11.906
- Yes!
- We're adequate!

16:11.908 --> 16:13.908
I get to keep my brain!

16:13.910 --> 16:16.444
So, I guess we'll
be seeing you guys.

16:16.446 --> 16:17.578
Have a safe trip.

16:17.580 --> 16:19.680
Oh, no, you'll be
coming with us.

16:19.682 --> 16:21.649
What?!

16:21.651 --> 16:25.586
We enjoyed your show so much we're
going to take you back to our planet

16:25.588 --> 16:28.289
to give to the king instead
of the prince Egg.

16:28.291 --> 16:31.258
You get to spend the rest of
your lives as musical slaves.

16:31.260 --> 16:32.893
Ooh, yay!

16:32.895 --> 16:34.562
Aah, that's horrible!

16:34.564 --> 16:35.830
- Musical slaves?
- Another planet?

16:35.832 --> 16:38.265
Yes! We're going
to another planet!

16:38.267 --> 16:39.333
I call shotgun!

16:46.942 --> 16:49.777
How do you know the king is gonna
even like their performance?

16:49.779 --> 16:53.214
Some people don't
like the way I dance.

16:54.045 --> 16:56.313
- Brilliant!
- Teach us your ways!

16:57.786 --> 17:01.489
Well, let's just say the king
doesn't like my performance.

17:01.491 --> 17:02.823
What happens then?

17:02.825 --> 17:05.326
Don't worry. He'll still
suck your brains.

17:05.328 --> 17:07.294
It's a win-win.

17:07.296 --> 17:08.929
For you.

17:08.931 --> 17:11.298
- Mmm.
- Ooh.

17:11.300 --> 17:13.501
Well, um... take me instead!

17:13.502 --> 17:14.969
I can be very entertaining.

17:14.971 --> 17:16.971
I tell jokes.

17:16.973 --> 17:19.507
So a Zalien walks into
a Lethusian diner.

17:19.509 --> 17:20.907
The lethusian waitress says...

17:25.815 --> 17:28.816
Trust me. That's hysterical
if you speak Lethusian.

17:28.818 --> 17:30.651
You're very funny.

17:30.653 --> 17:31.986
But you're not a human.

17:31.988 --> 17:33.254
Yeah, I am.

17:33.989 --> 17:36.323
Not.

17:36.325 --> 17:38.325
Since we haven't found
the prince Egg,

17:38.327 --> 17:40.494
we cannot go back to
the king empty-handed.

17:40.496 --> 17:43.230
The souvenir snow globes
aren't cutting it anymore.

17:43.232 --> 17:44.965
Mm...

17:47.002 --> 17:48.002
I have an idea.

17:48.004 --> 17:49.837
You heard the Zaliens.

17:49.839 --> 17:51.705
They were sent here to
find the prince Egg.

17:51.707 --> 17:54.308
If we find it, maybe we can
trade it for our freedom.

17:54.310 --> 17:55.976
Good point.

17:55.978 --> 17:58.446
The egg must still be at
the convention somewhere.

17:58.448 --> 18:02.016
We just need to stall them so you and
Dez can find it before we blast off.

18:03.820 --> 18:04.952
Oh! I know.

18:04.954 --> 18:07.955
You guys wanna learn
my signature dance?

18:07.957 --> 18:10.591
Ooh!

18:10.593 --> 18:12.660
- Now twirl.
- Ooh...

18:15.297 --> 18:20.301
You are the most talented creature
in this entire solar system!

18:20.303 --> 18:21.969
You've got to be kidding me.

18:25.907 --> 18:26.907
Trish, wait!

18:26.909 --> 18:28.275
What?!

18:28.277 --> 18:30.044
Free brain jerky samples?

18:30.046 --> 18:32.413
- Focus!
- Aww.

18:32.415 --> 18:34.315
Let's get the egg and
get out of here.

18:35.484 --> 18:36.617
This shouldn't be too hard.

18:36.619 --> 18:38.919
It has to be one of those.

18:38.921 --> 18:41.789
Or one of those.

18:43.359 --> 18:45.059
There are hundreds of eggs!

18:45.061 --> 18:47.294
How are we supposed to know
which one's the prince egg?

18:47.296 --> 18:48.929
Real Zalien eggs
are unbreakable.

18:48.931 --> 18:52.633
Then I guess there's only
one thing we gotta do.

18:56.972 --> 18:58.038
Excuse me.

19:09.918 --> 19:11.852
Aw, cool!

19:12.989 --> 19:14.054
Aw.

19:15.023 --> 19:16.090
Oh!

19:44.052 --> 19:46.921
We went through all the eggs!

19:46.923 --> 19:48.689
There's one left!

19:48.691 --> 19:50.057
That's gotta be it!

19:50.059 --> 19:52.560
I worked for three
years and sold my bike

19:52.562 --> 19:55.663
to buy this collector's edition
egg, but it was totally worth it!

19:55.665 --> 19:57.965
We'll be taking that.

19:57.967 --> 19:58.999
It didn't break!

19:59.001 --> 20:01.101
- That's the prince egg!
- Yes!

20:03.138 --> 20:04.972
Climb the rope, climb the rope.

20:04.974 --> 20:06.473
Wash the windows,
wash the windows.

20:06.475 --> 20:09.009
Dry your hands, dry your hands.

20:09.011 --> 20:11.879
You think that's cool,
check these moves out.

20:13.481 --> 20:14.682
Boom.

20:14.684 --> 20:16.083
Eh...

20:16.085 --> 20:18.118
- Ally, do your thing again.
- Ooh...

20:18.120 --> 20:19.853
Wait!

20:19.855 --> 20:22.156
They're not just gonna trade Austin
and Ally for the prince egg.

20:22.158 --> 20:24.024
Zaliens are tough negotiators.

20:24.026 --> 20:25.859
There's gonna be a lot of
offers and counteroffers.

20:25.861 --> 20:27.461
This could take hours.

20:27.463 --> 20:28.662
I'll trade you the prince
egg for my friends.

20:28.664 --> 20:29.664
Deal.

20:31.534 --> 20:32.766
Yeah!

20:35.171 --> 20:37.071
You're a human!

20:37.073 --> 20:38.405
Is that my scrunchie?

20:38.974 --> 20:41.008
He's a human?!

20:41.010 --> 20:43.043
Let's all eat his brains!

20:43.045 --> 20:44.678
- Trish!
- Sorry.

20:44.680 --> 20:46.080
Zalien brain suck!

20:53.555 --> 20:55.022
Dez! Dez, wake up!

20:58.994 --> 21:01.095
I just had the scariest dream.

21:01.097 --> 21:02.096
What happened?

21:02.098 --> 21:04.531
Trish had a crush on me.

21:05.767 --> 21:08.068
You were screaming
something about Zaliens.

21:08.070 --> 21:09.470
Oh, yeah.

21:09.472 --> 21:10.804
There were Zaliens in it, too.

21:10.806 --> 21:14.074
They took you guys as musical slaves,
and sucked out my brains, or something.

21:14.076 --> 21:15.909
But Trish had a crush on me!

21:15.911 --> 21:17.478
Oh, great.

21:17.480 --> 21:19.195
Now I'm gonna have nightmares.

21:19.226 --> 21:22.683
Oh, but in my dream, we met
real Zaliens at the convention.

21:22.685 --> 21:24.018
Speaking of which, let's go.

21:24.020 --> 21:27.054
Ooh. Uh...

21:27.056 --> 21:28.188
We already went.

21:28.190 --> 21:29.357
We tried to wake you up.

21:29.388 --> 21:31.959
But you were so tired from
staying up for three days,

21:31.961 --> 21:34.461
to get tickets that you slept
through the whole thing.

21:34.463 --> 21:36.797
Aw, man. I missed
the convention?

21:38.100 --> 21:39.800
Sorry, bud.

21:39.802 --> 21:41.502
But I saved you
some brain jerky.

21:43.972 --> 21:46.006
Ugh! Once you've had
real brain jerky

21:46.008 --> 21:48.008
you can never go back
to the fake stuff.

21:49.245 --> 21:50.511
Ugh...

21:53.481 --> 21:56.016
So I said, "that's not a..."

21:56.018 --> 21:57.151
"That's my girlfriend."

22:01.890 --> 22:04.991
So, what do you get when you
cross a Lethusian with a...?

22:05.022 --> 22:06.827
I don't know, but you better...

22:06.829 --> 22:08.829
Your...

22:11.834 --> 22:13.834
Why is this funny again?

22:13.836 --> 22:16.170
Ally, don't be such a...

22:16.172 --> 22:18.138
Good one!

22:19.675 --> 22:20.974
So where are you two from?

22:20.976 --> 22:23.510
Oh, Zarkania? I'll
speak slower then.
