WEBVTT

00:04.874 --> 00:06.441
Pudding's almost cooled.

00:06.528 --> 00:08.443
Another five minutes,
I'll peel the skin off

00:08.530 --> 00:10.358
and baptize it in Reddi-wip.

00:10.445 --> 00:12.403
Aw!

00:12.490 --> 00:14.101
Actually, we-we have to go.

00:14.188 --> 00:16.451
I've-I've got,
I've got papers to grade

00:16.538 --> 00:18.235
and Mike has, you know..

00:20.281 --> 00:23.284
Now you, you have something,
sweetie?

00:23.371 --> 00:24.894
Nope, football's over,
my Sunday nights

00:24.981 --> 00:26.417
are pretty much wide open.

00:28.463 --> 00:30.421
Well, apparently, I misspoke.

00:33.163 --> 00:34.599
What's happening
on the baby front?

00:34.686 --> 00:36.297
Am I gonna be a grandma
or should I just

00:36.384 --> 00:39.256
fill up my wallet
with baseball cards?

00:39.343 --> 00:40.997
Well, we could be home
right now trying

00:41.084 --> 00:44.218
but instead, we're here, waiting
for you to skin the puddin'.

00:46.002 --> 00:48.352
If you're totally barren,
I guess the two of you

00:48.439 --> 00:52.139
could always adopt
some unwanted brat.

00:52.226 --> 00:54.010
I'm not barren, Peggy, okay?

00:54.097 --> 00:55.925
If I was any more fertile,
I'd have pumpkins

00:56.012 --> 00:57.318
growing out of me.

00:59.494 --> 01:01.757
If you do adopt,
steer clear of those

01:01.844 --> 01:04.368
teen mom Appalachian babies.

01:04.455 --> 01:07.328
Give me Chinese
over white trash any day.

01:07.415 --> 01:09.243
They'll walk on your back,
and you don't have to worry

01:09.330 --> 01:13.203
about 'em hocking your TV
for methamphetamine.

01:13.290 --> 01:16.206
- Get me the hell out of here.
- It's no big deal.

01:16.293 --> 01:17.860
It's just taking a little
longer than we'd hoped.

01:17.947 --> 01:19.209
You remember what that was like.

01:19.296 --> 01:20.950
Sure, your old man's seed

01:21.037 --> 01:22.647
didn't take on the first poke

01:22.734 --> 01:25.041
but I wasn't racing
the clock like this one.

01:26.738 --> 01:28.697
I'm still a vital young woman.

01:28.784 --> 01:31.961
I'm engaging.
Why do I keep engaging?

01:32.048 --> 01:34.877
And if the adoption agencies
don't find you suitable

01:34.964 --> 01:36.574
you can always
get yourself a cat.

01:36.661 --> 01:37.836
They'll give those to anybody.

01:37.923 --> 01:39.621
[barks]

01:39.708 --> 01:43.190
Okay, good food,
good fun and goodnight.

01:44.191 --> 01:45.453
Thanks for dinner, mom.

01:45.540 --> 01:47.237
I guess you could just
save me some pudding.

01:47.324 --> 01:49.239
Well, you can have it with
your cake, when you come over

01:49.326 --> 01:51.415
Tuesday night
for your birthday bash.

01:51.502 --> 01:54.723
No, we agreed that this year,
his birthday was at our house.

01:54.810 --> 01:56.028
Real nice.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.856
Make a poor old lady
drag herself

01:57.943 --> 02:00.207
halfway across town
for your flavorless cake

02:00.294 --> 02:02.296
and snotty comments.

02:02.383 --> 02:04.298
I'm not making you do anything,
old woman.

02:04.385 --> 02:05.429
You don't want to come,
don't come!

02:05.516 --> 02:07.039
I'll be so disappointed

02:07.127 --> 02:08.998
but I'll get over it!

02:12.349 --> 02:16.092
Whoo! I hope the children
don't get her temperament.

02:16.179 --> 02:19.487
Maybe it's a blessing
she can't breed.

02:19.574 --> 02:22.446
Thanks, mom.
Another Sunday Funday.

02:22.533 --> 02:24.883
It was, wasn't it,
and just so you know

02:24.970 --> 02:27.756
you don't have to bring her
with you every time.

02:27.843 --> 02:32.239
We're married now.
My hell is her hell.

02:32.326 --> 02:37.722
♪ For the first time
in my life ♪

02:37.809 --> 02:40.986
♪ I see love ♪♪

02:53.477 --> 02:55.044
Look, I know that
she's your mother

02:55.131 --> 02:57.220
but if some stranger
talked to me like that

02:57.307 --> 02:59.396
they'd get a kisser
full of this.

02:59.483 --> 03:02.182
I've told you before, you can't
let her push your buttons.

03:02.269 --> 03:03.531
She doesn't
just push my buttons.

03:03.618 --> 03:06.447
She leans on 'em,
she tapes 'em down.

03:06.534 --> 03:07.883
You know
she's never gonna change

03:07.970 --> 03:09.972
so why not learn to be
the bigger person?

03:10.059 --> 03:11.626
I am being the bigger person.

03:11.713 --> 03:13.280
Otherwise, she'd be in
the emergency room

03:13.367 --> 03:17.893
getting my sensible shoe removed
from her hateful old rump.

03:17.980 --> 03:20.200
Wow, you know, right there,
you sound exactly like my dad?

03:20.287 --> 03:21.679
Uh, when we do have a baby

03:21.766 --> 03:24.595
I'm not letting that nasty woman
anywhere near it.

03:24.682 --> 03:25.683
Come on.

03:25.770 --> 03:27.468
And even if we accidentally

03:27.555 --> 03:29.426
drive by her house,
we'll tell our kids

03:29.513 --> 03:31.602
that's where
an old devil witch lives.

03:31.689 --> 03:33.865
That's exactly what my dad
would say each time

03:33.952 --> 03:37.086
he and I came home
from a ball game.

03:37.173 --> 03:39.262
I just think we should rethink
this birthday party thing.

03:39.349 --> 03:41.960
I don't think I can handle that
woman two days in one week.

03:42.047 --> 03:44.572
What? You're gonna
cancel my birthday party?

03:44.659 --> 03:46.269
No, we can still
do something fun.

03:46.356 --> 03:49.490
Hey, that miniature golf place
just opened up for the season.

03:49.577 --> 03:52.188
That's lame.
I don't want to do that.

03:52.275 --> 03:55.713
Fine, I'll do whatever you want.
Keep it small.

03:55.800 --> 03:58.499
And by small, I mean
anyone but your mother.

04:00.065 --> 04:02.981
Come on, Mol. It's my birthday.

04:03.068 --> 04:06.724
I'm counting on you
to be the reasonable person.

04:06.811 --> 04:10.728
Gah! Alright!
I'll suck it up.

04:10.815 --> 04:12.034
Pull into that 7-Eleven.

04:12.121 --> 04:15.211
That damn woman
put pudding in my brain.

04:20.564 --> 04:22.218
Hey, you're gonna
love the birthday present

04:22.305 --> 04:24.481
I got for you this year,
and I left the price tag on it

04:24.568 --> 04:28.093
so you know exactly
how much to spend on mine.

04:28.180 --> 04:29.704
That's very thoughtful of you.

04:29.791 --> 04:31.880
A-and feel free to go over
budget if you want to make up

04:31.967 --> 04:34.535
for buying me a pocket comb
and anti-fungal foot spray.

04:36.363 --> 04:37.799
Haven't you ever heard
the expression

04:37.886 --> 04:38.887
it's the thought that counts?

04:38.974 --> 04:40.105
Eh, what thought?

04:40.192 --> 04:41.237
You bought a man
with no hair a comb

04:41.324 --> 04:43.935
and you could eat off
of my feet.

04:44.022 --> 04:47.156
Hello. Welcome to Abraham's.
Do you know what you would like?

04:47.243 --> 04:51.247
Uh, you, a dark room,
and some Barry White music.

04:51.334 --> 04:52.988
No-no-no-no-no-no,
hey, Shyama!

04:53.075 --> 04:56.034
Uh-uh, go away, please.
Uh, this is my table.

04:56.121 --> 04:57.949
Well, my, my, my

04:58.036 --> 05:00.082
it looks like we got something
new and tasty on the menu.

05:00.169 --> 05:01.910
Really? Did they bring back
corn fritters?

05:01.997 --> 05:04.565
I love those things.

05:04.652 --> 05:06.871
Carl, she is new to this country

05:06.958 --> 05:08.830
and deserves better than
some skeevy guy

05:08.917 --> 05:11.049
trying to take advantage
of her trusting nature

05:11.136 --> 05:13.443
just to get her into bed.

05:13.530 --> 05:15.402
Besides, I saw her first,
so I got dibs.

05:18.709 --> 05:21.886
Yeah, we gonna see about that,
Wally the Waiter.

05:21.973 --> 05:23.627
Hey, you better plan
on eating every meal

05:23.714 --> 05:25.412
of every day right here.

05:25.499 --> 05:27.762
Sure, sure. I'm not seeing
corn fritters anywhere.

06:06.714 --> 06:09.456
and I'm working
with a gabby crew.

06:09.543 --> 06:12.154
Okay, um, for Mike's sake

06:12.241 --> 06:14.548
can we just
put our differences aside?

06:14.635 --> 06:16.027
Hey, I'm not the pigheaded one

06:16.114 --> 06:17.551

No, you're a real peach.

[sighs]
Look, he wants a birthday party,
and for whatever reason

06:24.732 --> 06:26.037
he wants us both there.

06:26.124 --> 06:27.299
Well, he wants me there

06:27.387 --> 06:28.779
because I'm the woman
who gave him life.

06:28.866 --> 06:30.607

06:43.838 --> 06:45.709
Fine.
7 o'clock at my house tonight.

06:45.796 --> 06:48.190
We'll hash out the details
for the boy's soiree.

06:48.277 --> 06:50.322
Great. You know,
we could do it at my place, too.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.194
I've got a computer
and Internet access.

06:52.281 --> 06:54.762

or hacking into The Pentagon?

07:02.596 --> 07:04.336

place standing tall

07:06.251 --> 07:08.340

weeks of training

07:23.355 --> 07:25.140
we will begin to split the tips.

That is most generous of you,
Samuel.

07:27.403 --> 07:30.319
Seventy-thirty, of course.

07:30.406 --> 07:32.321
So, uh, what are you doing now?

Would you like to grab a beer,
perhaps take a walk in the park?

Oh, no, I'm very tired.

how about a foot massage?

Hey, Samuel,
you ready to go home?

07:47.728 --> 07:48.946
What am I doing here?

07:49.033 --> 07:51.427
I'm here to give my roommate
a ride home.

07:51.514 --> 07:53.603
Brother doesn't have a car.

07:53.690 --> 07:55.692
You have never once
given me a ride home.

07:55.779 --> 07:58.478
And you always flip me off
when you see me at the bus stop.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.046
What? That was just for fun.

08:02.133 --> 08:03.091
You know,
give you a little chuckle

08:03.178 --> 08:06.007
on your long-ass bus ride.

08:06.094 --> 08:07.748
How about you?
You need a ride?

08:07.835 --> 08:09.227
- Well..
- No.

08:09.314 --> 08:10.794
We are taking the bus home.

08:10.881 --> 08:13.057
I'm giving Shyama
the nickel tour of the city.

08:13.144 --> 08:14.755
Man, that's half your savings.

08:16.539 --> 08:18.498
A-and besides, we can't
show a delicate flower

on a dirty city bus.

08:20.804 --> 08:22.502
No, she needs to see it
from the passenger seat

08:22.589 --> 08:25.330
of a 2003 Chevrolet Blazer.

08:26.897 --> 08:28.551
You own your own car?

08:28.638 --> 08:30.727
In 13 more easy payments, I do.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.513
- You ever seen a moonroof?
- No.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.428
Girl, you in for a treat.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.343
I might even
let you work the button.

08:38.430 --> 08:42.173
No, no, no, no!
Don't touch his button!

08:42.260 --> 08:44.480
Damn it.
Guys with cars can kiss my ass.

08:48.484 --> 08:52.009
Okay, I was thinking for Mike's
birthday extravaganza this year

08:52.096 --> 08:54.142
that maybe we could, you know,
maybe mix it up a little.

08:54.229 --> 08:55.926
Kinda go a little, uh, classy.

08:56.013 --> 08:58.276
Great, I'll pluck my toe hairs.

09:00.322 --> 09:02.542
Might want to do that
regardless of the theme.

09:02.629 --> 09:06.023
But, uh, anyway, I was thinking
we could do little finger foods

09:06.110 --> 09:08.635
and, uh, ooh,
maybe do a signature drink.

09:08.722 --> 09:11.159
Call it a Mike-tini.

09:11.246 --> 09:13.291
Uh-huh. Whose birthday
are we celebrating

09:13.378 --> 09:16.338
my son's or Liberace's?

09:16.425 --> 09:18.470
That's funny.
That's funny, Liberace.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.648
But, uh, you know,
actually, a piano player

09:21.735 --> 09:23.127
that's actually
a very good idea.

09:23.214 --> 09:25.260
Sure. Why not hire some swish

09:25.347 --> 09:28.611
to wear a gold-leaf jockstrap
and strum a harp?

09:31.875 --> 09:33.964
Let-let's just say
that we'll have music.

09:34.051 --> 09:36.750
Okay, we're making headway!

09:38.360 --> 09:40.580
Look, all the boy
wants is a hunk of cake

09:40.667 --> 09:44.627
the size of a cinder block
and a fork that don't spark.

09:44.714 --> 09:46.716
Actually, we're-we're not gonna
have a cake.

09:46.803 --> 09:48.805
What?
A birthday party without cake

09:48.892 --> 09:50.590
is just a house
full of strangers

09:50.677 --> 09:53.375
raiding your medicine cabinet
and clogging your toilet.

09:56.030 --> 09:57.422

we could have a nice

cake, cake, and more cake.

10:05.169 --> 10:07.128

a backup cake.

What are you
trying to do to him

10:10.000 --> 10:11.611

10:11.698 --> 10:14.570
Oh, it's one day of the year,

10:14.657 --> 10:16.267
The next morning,
you can lock him back up

10:16.354 --> 10:18.400
in your fat-free Folsom.

10:21.229 --> 10:22.970
How about we just give him
a big spoon

10:23.057 --> 10:25.625
and a big bag of sugar?

10:25.712 --> 10:28.149
No. His dad and I did that
on his fifth birthday.

10:28.236 --> 10:30.107
He ended up
biting the neighbor's dog.

10:32.327 --> 10:36.984
Okay. How about
a nice angel food cake

full of migrant workers?

10:47.037 --> 10:49.823
Okay, decorations.
