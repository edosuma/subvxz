03:31.379 --> 03:34.299
You see a guy in a corduroy coat go by?

03:35.008 --> 03:36.342
Sir?

03:37.510 --> 03:38.928
Sir?

03:39.429 --> 03:41.431
Young guy, dark hair, corduroy coat?

03:45.602 --> 03:47.145
How about it?

03:54.903 --> 03:57.030
Hey, Nick. Come here.

04:01.075 --> 04:03.036
Wanna come on out here?

04:11.085 --> 04:13.421
Go ahead and open your jacket for me.

04:18.468 --> 04:22.263
I'm placing you under arrest, sir.
Put your hands on your head, please.

04:27.810 --> 04:30.897
- Nick, wanna grab those for me?
- You got it.

04:35.777 --> 04:37.779
All right, let's go.

04:38.404 --> 04:40.031
Nice job.

04:41.324 --> 04:43.326
Say nothing. You understand?
Get a lawyer.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.835
Get a lawyer.

04:54.879 --> 04:56.798
Asshole.

05:07.642 --> 05:09.143
- Ladies.
- Hey, Gene.

05:09.310 --> 05:10.353
Nice lunch?

05:10.520 --> 05:12.772
Oh, yeah. What you need?

05:12.939 --> 05:15.066
Rolls about to come out.

05:15.233 --> 05:16.901
You got it.

05:58.443 --> 06:00.611
So can I, uh, tell Howard...

06:00.778 --> 06:04.532
...you're not quitting,
or retiring or whatever?

06:05.491 --> 06:09.037
And can we take all this shit
down off the walls?

06:11.706 --> 06:13.833
I'm gonna go call Howard.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.334
Jimmy.

06:15.501 --> 06:19.756
You do realise you just confessed
to a felony?

06:20.006 --> 06:21.674
I guess.

06:21.841 --> 06:24.093
But you feel better, right?

06:24.719 --> 06:27.680
Besides, it's your word against mine.

07:10.348 --> 07:11.599
<i>Absolutely.</i>

07:11.766 --> 07:13.559
Coming back.

07:14.060 --> 07:15.895
What's it matter what I said, Howard?

07:16.062 --> 07:19.232
Why are you looking a gift horse
in the mouth? He just--

07:19.941 --> 07:22.568
Yeah. Well, whatever it was,
he's over it now. All right?

07:22.735 --> 07:25.696
And by the way, you're welcome.

07:35.665 --> 07:39.669
Well, Howard's breathing again.
You made him very happy.

08:07.655 --> 08:09.031
Jimmy.

08:09.198 --> 08:10.992
Jimmy, if you're gonna help...

08:11.159 --> 08:13.202
...at least use a little finesse, won't you?

08:13.369 --> 08:16.164
- Finesse? What do you--?
- Quit yanking at it. You're--

08:16.330 --> 08:19.041
You're pulling the varnish
right off the walnut.

08:19.208 --> 08:24.005
- I'm not pulling any varnish off the walnut.
- You most certainly are. Look. Look. See?

08:24.172 --> 08:26.424
Maybe you should've thought
about the walnut...

08:26.591 --> 08:29.552
- ...before you covered it in duct tape.
- I don't need your help.

08:29.719 --> 08:33.681
- I don't recall ever asking for it.
- I'm sorry. Okay?

08:33.931 --> 08:36.684
Finesse. Fine. Show me. Demonstrate.

08:36.851 --> 08:38.561
Like this.

08:39.187 --> 08:43.608
Gently roll it with your thumbs.

08:43.774 --> 08:46.527
Left and then right.

08:46.694 --> 08:49.113
You see? Alternate the thumbs.

08:49.280 --> 08:51.532
Up and down.

08:51.824 --> 08:54.619
Ahem. Get a nice tight roll going.

08:54.785 --> 08:58.247
Sorry. I think you're the one
that needs a nice tight roll.

08:58.831 --> 09:00.917
Come on. Show me.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.336
Gently. Gently.

09:03.502 --> 09:05.087
Left, then right.

09:05.630 --> 09:06.631
Left, right.

09:06.797 --> 09:09.592
I get it. Wax on, wax off.

09:09.884 --> 09:12.053
Mr Miyagi.

09:12.345 --> 09:14.096
<i>Karate Kid.</i>

09:16.933 --> 09:18.809
Seriously?

09:31.113 --> 09:32.949
Oh, my God.

09:33.115 --> 09:36.160
<i>The Adventures of Mabel.</i> I--

09:36.327 --> 09:38.829
I haven't thought about this in forever.
Remember this?

09:38.996 --> 09:40.706
I do.

09:41.249 --> 09:43.501
- Harry Thurston Peck.
- Yeah.

09:43.668 --> 09:45.711
Mabel goes into the mountain...

09:45.878 --> 09:49.423
...and she meets the king of the brownies,
and he gives her...

09:49.590 --> 09:53.010
...some kind of
super-delicious jelly, and--

09:54.136 --> 09:56.138
Holy crap. 1912.

09:56.305 --> 09:58.557
Yeah. Belonged to Grammy Davenport.

09:58.724 --> 10:00.226
She wrote her name in it.

10:00.393 --> 10:04.855
She was reading that to her school kids
the year the <i>Titanic</i> went down.

10:05.022 --> 10:06.023
Damn.

10:06.190 --> 10:07.775
Then Mom read it to me.

10:07.942 --> 10:10.528
I read it to you.

10:12.029 --> 10:13.072
You don't remember.

10:13.239 --> 10:14.740
Yeah. Yeah.

10:14.907 --> 10:17.243
I do now that you say it. Yeah.

10:17.410 --> 10:20.538
What was I, like 5 or 6?

10:21.289 --> 10:23.124
You had had...

10:23.291 --> 10:28.170
...this weird night light
that you were so crazy about.

10:28.337 --> 10:29.964
It was, um--

10:30.464 --> 10:31.465
It was Daffy Duck.

10:31.632 --> 10:34.218
It was some Daffy Duck rip-off
with this weird red bill.

10:34.385 --> 10:35.928
- Mouth. Oh, yeah. The bill.
- Yeah.

10:36.095 --> 10:38.931
It used to get so hot,
we thought it'd burn the house down...

10:39.098 --> 10:42.560
- ...but you wouldn't let anybody touch it.
- Honest to--

10:42.727 --> 10:45.021
You got a great memory, Chuck.

10:45.187 --> 10:47.982
That red bill and everything. Hey.

10:48.149 --> 10:52.361
What was the name of that little girl
that lived three houses up from us?

10:52.528 --> 10:54.822
- She had, like, a pageboy haircut...
- Jimmy.

10:54.989 --> 10:57.616
...and she was always in the dirt,
always dirty.

10:57.783 --> 11:00.411
- I liked her, and she was always--
- Jimmy. Jimmy.

11:01.704 --> 11:04.832
Don't think I'll ever forget
what happened here today.

11:12.006 --> 11:14.216
And you will pay.

11:32.151 --> 11:34.945
You didn't mention my garden.

11:35.112 --> 11:36.947
Your garden is part of your backyard...

11:37.114 --> 11:39.658
...so it's included
in the property that goes to Jenn.

11:39.825 --> 11:42.536
It comes with the house, Mom.

11:42.703 --> 11:45.414
Well, I think you need
to mention it by name...

11:45.581 --> 11:49.460
...in case some dirty judge
decides to play tricks.

11:49.960 --> 11:53.130
Okay. We can do that.

11:54.090 --> 11:55.716
Let's see.

11:56.258 --> 11:58.094
Garden.

11:58.260 --> 12:00.304
Hey, I'm back.
Oh, hi, ladies. Jimmy McGill.

12:00.471 --> 12:02.264
Hey, Jimmy. We are almost done here.

12:02.681 --> 12:04.767
- Great. Can I--?
- We're almost done.

12:04.934 --> 12:07.228
I'll be with you in a minute.

12:14.068 --> 12:15.277
Oh.

12:15.444 --> 12:17.154
And mention my lily pond.

12:17.321 --> 12:19.365
It's in my garden.

12:20.574 --> 12:22.201
Lily pond.

12:35.005 --> 12:37.508
- Okay, ladies.
- Thanks so much for your help.

12:37.675 --> 12:40.052
You're very welcome.
Thank you for being so patient.

12:40.219 --> 12:43.222
And, Mrs Aherne, if you or Margaret
ever need anything from me...

12:43.389 --> 12:45.641
...anything at all,
you can call me day or night.

12:45.808 --> 12:47.852
This is Mrs Siemasko
and her daughter Jenn.

12:48.018 --> 12:50.729
I'm sorry.
I get my wires crossed a little.

12:50.896 --> 12:52.064
- Bye.
- Bye.

12:52.231 --> 12:53.274
- Drive safe.
- Thank you.

12:53.441 --> 12:55.151
Okay. Thank you.

12:57.319 --> 12:58.946
You are a superhero.

12:59.113 --> 13:01.991
I owe you big time.

13:10.416 --> 13:11.917
Huh.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.462
So how's Chuck?

13:14.628 --> 13:17.882
Crisis averted, I guess. I mean...

13:18.048 --> 13:21.927
...he's back to being
the same old Chuck, so....

13:22.470 --> 13:24.472
Wanna talk about it?

13:25.055 --> 13:26.599
Depends.

13:26.765 --> 13:28.517
It may or may not involve...

13:28.684 --> 13:31.312
...that thing you said you never,
ever wanted to discuss.

13:31.479 --> 13:33.814
Okay. Then thanks.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.274
I gotta get back to it.

13:35.441 --> 13:39.153
How about we call it a day?
I'll buy you some dinner.

13:39.320 --> 13:40.321
You're kidding, right?

13:40.488 --> 13:42.281
You realise how far behind I am...

13:42.448 --> 13:44.950
...not to mention,
now I've got eight wills to finish?

13:45.117 --> 13:46.410
What? I'll do the wills.

13:46.577 --> 13:48.245
- No, you won't.
- Of course I will...

13:48.412 --> 13:50.080
...do the wills. They're my clients.

13:50.247 --> 13:52.833
They're my clients.
You and I aren't partners, remember?

13:53.000 --> 13:55.711
Once I take people on,
I can't just reassign them to you.

13:55.878 --> 13:58.506
Oh, come on. Why you getting all,
like, legal on me, huh?

13:58.672 --> 14:00.382
Who cares?

14:01.050 --> 14:04.803
I told every single one the situation:
that they'd be getting me instead of you.

14:04.970 --> 14:07.056
I tried to talk them into
coming another day.

14:07.223 --> 14:09.225
Six left. Maybe you'll get those back.

14:09.391 --> 14:12.228
- Look. If this is about the money--
- It's not about the money.

14:12.394 --> 14:13.854
You can keep the money.

14:14.021 --> 14:15.940
Don't act like I wanted this.

14:16.106 --> 14:18.609
Jesus, like I need more on my plate?

14:25.282 --> 14:26.909
Are you mad?

14:28.661 --> 14:30.496
I'm not mad.

14:32.122 --> 14:33.749
I'm just, uh...

14:36.126 --> 14:38.420
...thinking about things.

14:44.510 --> 14:47.930
For 10 minutes today,
Chuck didn't hate me.

14:50.432 --> 14:52.851
I forgot what that felt like.

15:18.544 --> 15:19.878
<i>Jimmy.</i>

15:21.380 --> 15:25.551
<i>You do realise
you just confessed to a felony?</i>

15:26.051 --> 15:27.803
<i>I guess.</i>

15:27.970 --> 15:30.180
<i>But you feel better, right?</i>

15:31.181 --> 15:34.268
<i>Besides, it's your word against mine.</i>

15:34.602 --> 15:36.478
That's the end of it.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.440
Howard.

15:39.607 --> 15:41.108
- That's the end.
- Mm.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.486
Could you...?

15:45.154 --> 15:46.905
Oh. Yeah.

15:50.534 --> 15:53.412
Well, now do you believe me?

15:56.373 --> 15:58.792
I don't even know where to begin.

15:59.418 --> 16:00.794
But yes, I believe you.

16:02.004 --> 16:05.132
Your brother
is one world-class son of a bitch.

16:06.425 --> 16:07.593
No offence.

16:09.011 --> 16:12.473
I just really wish you'd told me
about these plans of yours...

16:12.640 --> 16:16.477
- ...before you went out and did it.
- I know, and I regret misleading you.

16:16.644 --> 16:20.731
It's just that a certain vérité
had to be established.

16:20.898 --> 16:24.026
I'm not talking about the heart attack
that you nearly gave me.

16:24.568 --> 16:26.487
Chuck, this tape.

16:26.654 --> 16:29.239
I'm not sure exactly what it accomplishes.

16:29.406 --> 16:31.575
You know evidentiary rules
better than I do...

16:31.742 --> 16:35.579
...but a secretly recorded tape
with a problematic chain of evidence?

16:35.746 --> 16:38.624
- It will be hell of a time getting it admitted.
- I agree.

16:38.791 --> 16:40.417
If you put it in front of a jury...

16:40.584 --> 16:44.713
...Jimmy would call audio experts to say
the voice isn't his, and the tape is edited.

16:44.880 --> 16:45.881
He would, indeed.

16:46.048 --> 16:49.218
Are you thinking about playing this
for Kevin Wachtell at Mesa Verde?

16:49.385 --> 16:52.846
Because as much as I would love to,
that ship has sailed.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.973
We're never
getting them back, regardless.

16:55.140 --> 16:58.060
Oh, I doubt we could even
get in the door over there.

16:58.227 --> 17:02.272
If that tape is useless in a court of law
and no help in the court of public opinion...

17:02.439 --> 17:03.607
...what's the point?

17:03.774 --> 17:06.235
Because I can't think of a single use for it.

17:07.569 --> 17:09.238
I can.

21:56.066 --> 21:57.734
Hey, mister.

21:57.901 --> 22:00.988
We're closing in 15 minutes.

22:07.577 --> 22:09.871
Call me a cab, will you?

22:12.290 --> 22:14.376
What about your vehicle?

22:15.210 --> 22:17.004
Keep it.

22:21.299 --> 22:23.343
Five J's Auto Salvage.

22:24.011 --> 22:27.014
Broadway, at Bobby Foster's.

22:27.806 --> 22:30.308
Yeah. Ehr-- Ehr-- Ehr--

22:30.475 --> 22:31.727
How is it again?

22:31.893 --> 22:33.603
Ehrmantraut.

22:33.770 --> 22:36.023
Yeah. Ehrmantraut.

22:36.440 --> 22:37.899
Yeah.

22:38.191 --> 22:41.611
Just tell him
to pull up to the gate and honk.

22:42.237 --> 22:43.280
Okay.

22:43.447 --> 22:45.032
Thanks.

22:45.198 --> 22:46.408
They're on their way.

22:46.575 --> 22:48.285
Thank you.

23:35.749 --> 23:39.336
Do you sell a gas cap
for an '87 Caprice waggon?

23:39.503 --> 23:44.091
Should. GM cap should be the blue
on the bottom there.

26:51.569 --> 26:54.447
You're sure I can't help carry those
to your car, Mrs Vankamp?

26:54.614 --> 26:55.740
Don't be a silly.

26:55.907 --> 26:59.452
I only hope I didn't take too much
of your time with all my dusty old photos.

26:59.619 --> 27:03.498
Goodness, no.
Your grandson's wedding was gorgeous.

27:03.665 --> 27:06.501
When I come back,
I'll show you my niece's confirmation.

27:06.668 --> 27:09.045
- Wait till you see the flowers.
- Oh!

27:09.212 --> 27:11.965
- Roses, petunias, orchids.
- Uh-huh. Yes.

27:12.132 --> 27:14.676
- They don't smell. And baby's breath.
- Well--

27:14.843 --> 27:17.804
- And bachelor buttons. Lilies of the valley.
- Okay.

27:17.971 --> 27:21.057
- Well, I'll believe it when I see it.
- Daisies. Daisies don't tell.

27:21.224 --> 27:23.643
Now I've got something to look forward to.
Okay, bye.

27:23.810 --> 27:26.021
- Bye.
- See you.

27:28.565 --> 27:32.610
Thank you for waiting so patiently.
Who do we have next?

27:35.989 --> 27:37.615
That'd be me.

27:43.038 --> 27:44.581
Hello, hello.

27:44.748 --> 27:46.249
It's so good to see you again.

27:46.791 --> 27:51.212
I escorted you and your clients
onto my base.

27:51.379 --> 27:53.757
I treated you with hospitality and respect.

27:53.923 --> 27:56.760
Now I come to find every word
out of your mouth is a damn lie.

27:56.926 --> 27:59.346
Captain, please, sit down, take a load off.

27:59.512 --> 28:02.349
Hey, I'll get you a complimentary coffee,
or a soft drink?

28:02.515 --> 28:05.101
And your so-called war hero
Fudge Talbott?

28:05.268 --> 28:07.145
No such person. Never was.

28:07.312 --> 28:10.231
Granted, some artistic licence
may have been taken.

28:10.398 --> 28:13.151
You entered government property
under false pretences, sir.

28:13.318 --> 28:16.154
I am no expert on your procedures
and protocols and whatnot...

28:16.321 --> 28:21.451
...so if we failed to cross a T or dot an I,
I apologise for any misunderstanding.

28:21.618 --> 28:24.537
- No, it's not a misunderstanding.
- Step back. Big picture this.

28:24.704 --> 28:25.830
What damage was done?

28:25.997 --> 28:27.791
Hey, who was hurt, huh?

28:27.957 --> 28:30.377
What was damaged?
The base is still there, right?

28:30.543 --> 28:32.670
- The B-52 is, I presume, still--?
- B-29.

28:32.837 --> 28:36.091
- Huh?
- B-29. <i>Fifi's</i> a B-29.

28:38.968 --> 28:41.805
Oh, this is all just
one big joke to you. Huh?

28:42.555 --> 28:44.391
- You don't like the commercial.
- I don't.

28:44.557 --> 28:47.560
- But this has nothing to do--
- Constructive criticism is welcome.

28:47.727 --> 28:50.772
But you should realise
that most people find it uplifting.

28:50.939 --> 28:51.940
Patriotic, even.

28:52.107 --> 28:54.609
Check recruiting numbers.
I think you'll see an uptick.

28:54.776 --> 28:57.737
And you know what?
If it turns out Fudge wasn't in the war--

28:57.904 --> 29:00.323
Fudge is not a person.
He wasn't in the war.

29:00.490 --> 29:04.035
Well, neither was Tom Cruise,
and look what <i>Top Gun</i> did for you.

29:04.869 --> 29:06.079
You lied to me.

29:06.246 --> 29:09.082
You lied to my face,
and I can't let you get away with it.

29:09.874 --> 29:12.710
I think we just-- We're just gonna have to
agree to disagree.

29:12.877 --> 29:15.213
So can I get you that coffee to go, or--?

29:15.380 --> 29:18.925
No, no, I'm gonna tell you
what's happening now.

29:19.092 --> 29:20.927
You're gonna take that ad off the air.

29:21.094 --> 29:25.223
And if you play it again, I'll go to the judge
advocate, and we'll take you down.

29:25.390 --> 29:28.935
Trespassing, false representation,
stolen valour, the whole nine yards.

29:29.102 --> 29:30.812
For eight seconds of a TV commercial?

29:30.979 --> 29:34.816
You take that ad down,
or there'll be hell to pay.

29:34.983 --> 29:36.818
That clear enough for you?

29:38.987 --> 29:40.029
Make me.

29:40.780 --> 29:42.699
- Yeah? Make you?
- Heh. Yeah.

29:42.866 --> 29:44.909
Let's do this.
Bring your commander here.

29:45.076 --> 29:47.954
I'll explain how you let us on the base,
red-carpet treatment--

29:48.121 --> 29:49.831
Because you lied your way in.

29:49.998 --> 29:53.501
Not how I remember it,
and I've got witnesses to back me up.

29:53.668 --> 29:55.712
Do you like being
an Air Force captain? Huh?

29:55.879 --> 29:59.299
Think the United States wants to sue
an old man in a wheelchair?

29:59.466 --> 30:01.384
He was standing on TV.

30:01.551 --> 30:03.011
He wasn't even in a wheelchair.

30:03.178 --> 30:07.599
Periodically he is, and when he's in court,
you best believe he'll be in a wheelchair.

30:07.765 --> 30:10.268
You're an ambulance-chasing
piece of shit. All the same.

30:10.435 --> 30:14.481
Always on a high horse,
always trying to make me feel like I'm--

30:21.738 --> 30:23.281
Look, um...

30:23.448 --> 30:28.161
...I'm a lawyer, and this is what I do
all day, every day, so how about this?

30:28.328 --> 30:30.622
I won't fly jet planes.

30:30.788 --> 30:34.375
You stay out of court.
Does that sound good?

30:38.880 --> 30:41.090
You know, guys like you...

30:41.883 --> 30:44.511
...you think you're so damn smart.

30:44.761 --> 30:47.889
And you think you don't have
to play straight with anybody.

30:48.681 --> 30:50.099
The wheel is gonna turn.

30:50.808 --> 30:52.727
It always does.

31:07.367 --> 31:10.954
"A lawyer you can trust," my ass.

31:12.205 --> 31:14.707
Thank you for your service.

33:25.838 --> 33:28.716
Three-thirty in the morning? Seriously?

33:30.093 --> 33:31.135
Can you get me that?

33:33.262 --> 33:34.972
I don't know.

33:40.478 --> 33:42.522
- It's a real thing?
- Yeah.

33:42.689 --> 33:44.607
Then yeah.
I know someone who can get it.

33:44.774 --> 33:46.317
How much?

33:46.484 --> 33:48.194
What do I look like, RadioShack?

33:48.361 --> 33:51.322
It's gonna cost you whatever it costs me,
plus my end.

33:51.489 --> 33:52.782
Well, let's start with that.

33:53.449 --> 33:56.452
Normally, be about 500...

33:56.619 --> 34:00.790
...but seeing that this is
an after-hours house call...

34:00.957 --> 34:02.917
...let's make it a grand.

34:14.429 --> 34:16.264
Hey, how's the pup?

34:16.431 --> 34:18.266
Doing okay?

34:20.309 --> 34:23.479
- Yeah.
- She's not being left alone all day, is she?

34:23.646 --> 34:25.982
- She's got plenty of company.
- Good.

34:28.735 --> 34:31.446
Hey, this is gonna take me
a few days, so...

34:31.612 --> 34:33.531
...I'll let you know.

34:33.698 --> 34:35.408
And next time...

34:35.575 --> 34:39.412
...let's try to make business happen
during business hours.

35:14.530 --> 35:16.073
Mm-hm.

35:16.866 --> 35:21.287
Well, this will certainly help
my Thursday PowerPoint.

35:22.121 --> 35:23.748
Excellent.

35:25.082 --> 35:27.794
That's a draft letter from Kevin
to the Arizona regulator.

35:27.960 --> 35:30.421
I know he likes the personal touch.

35:30.588 --> 35:32.465
He's gonna love it.

35:32.632 --> 35:35.009
I can't believe you did all of this
in three days.

35:36.761 --> 35:38.429
Am I reading this right?

35:38.596 --> 35:40.431
Did you get the rehearing moved up?

35:40.598 --> 35:44.644
Yeah. Those are three possible dates,
depending on your and Kevin's schedule.

35:44.811 --> 35:46.646
The soonest I could get is the 4th.

35:46.813 --> 35:49.106
You moved it up almost three weeks.

35:49.273 --> 35:51.734
I'll give it another shot
and see if I can do better.

35:51.901 --> 35:53.903
Ha, ha! Are you kidding me?

35:54.070 --> 35:57.073
Kevin will be popping champagne.

35:57.865 --> 36:02.453
- I knew you were the right one for this.
- Well, I appreciate the opportunity.

36:02.620 --> 36:05.873
You should've heard how that arrogant jerk
spoke to me at the hearing.

36:06.040 --> 36:10.545
Right there in front of Kevin,
he accuses me of muddying the waters.

36:10.711 --> 36:13.881
Muddying the waters.

36:14.048 --> 36:17.176
I mean, he's the one
who can't even get the address right.

36:17.635 --> 36:19.470
Yeah. That's-- Wow!

36:19.637 --> 36:23.516
I know you have friends over at HHM.
They talk a good game, but come on.

36:23.683 --> 36:28.521
Guys like that, when crunch time comes,
it's always someone else's fault.

36:30.773 --> 36:31.816
Paige?

36:32.316 --> 36:34.652
I'm sorry to interrupt. It's almost 11:30.

36:34.819 --> 36:37.029
Thanks, Greta. I'll be right up.

36:37.321 --> 36:39.574
So are we still on for lunch Tuesday?

36:39.740 --> 36:43.619
Absolutely, and, Paige,
thank you for everything.

36:43.786 --> 36:46.914
No. Thank you for cleaning up
that mess McGill left behind.

36:47.707 --> 36:51.002
Would you mind if I messenger that over
tomorrow morning, first thing?

36:51.168 --> 36:53.963
I'd like to take one last look
before we submit, just...

36:54.130 --> 36:55.715
...double-check a few things.

36:55.882 --> 36:56.966
Sure.

36:57.133 --> 36:58.593
So tomorrow, first thing?

36:58.759 --> 36:59.927
Absolutely.

37:00.094 --> 37:01.137
Thanks.

37:01.304 --> 37:02.805
- I'll see you, Paige.
- Okay, bye.

37:48.267 --> 37:49.727
How's it coming in there?

37:51.604 --> 37:52.939
Good.

37:58.486 --> 38:01.364
- Don't mean to rush you.
- No. It's okay.

38:05.952 --> 38:07.244
I'm done.

38:17.338 --> 38:18.798
Half a rainbow?

38:18.965 --> 38:21.175
Wanna keep going
till you do the whole thing?

38:21.342 --> 38:24.470
No. If you're done, I'm done.

38:24.637 --> 38:27.640
You know,
your clients seem to like that rainbow.

38:27.807 --> 38:29.517
Think they're gonna miss it?

38:29.684 --> 38:31.519
Wait till they see what's going up next.

38:31.686 --> 38:33.729
They're gonna love it.
You're gonna love it.

38:33.896 --> 38:35.481
Yeah? Should I be worried?

38:35.648 --> 38:37.191
Nope.

38:37.900 --> 38:40.319
What do you say
we get the hell out of here?

38:40.486 --> 38:42.405
Sounds good.

39:06.929 --> 39:08.222
You ready to hit it?

39:08.389 --> 39:11.100
Sorry. I just need to check one thing.

39:11.684 --> 39:14.311
It'll be two minutes. Tops.

39:46.802 --> 39:47.845
Ernesto.

39:48.012 --> 39:49.555
Good morning, Mr McGill.

39:50.097 --> 39:52.600
They didn't have Fuji apples,
so I got you Honeycrisp.

39:52.767 --> 39:55.227
- Hope that's all right.
- I'm sure it'll be fine.

39:55.394 --> 39:56.562
Did you get the, uh--?

39:56.729 --> 39:58.314
Yeah. I got them.

39:58.481 --> 40:02.526
I went ahead
and I figured I should maybe....

40:08.491 --> 40:10.576
I wrapped them up, you know?
For safety.

40:10.743 --> 40:14.330
That's very thoughtful of you,
but I need them now, so....

40:14.622 --> 40:17.249
- You sure it's okay?
- It's okay.

40:22.671 --> 40:24.548
Ahem. Um....

40:25.591 --> 40:27.009
Yep.

40:35.601 --> 40:37.269
Perfect.

40:47.738 --> 40:49.281
Shit.

41:09.468 --> 41:10.761
Ah!

41:14.431 --> 41:16.392
Ernesto, could you come in here, please?

41:20.020 --> 41:22.356
Thought I could do this myself.

41:22.523 --> 41:24.316
Would you mind changing the batteries?

41:24.483 --> 41:26.527
Sure thing, Mr McGill.

41:27.403 --> 41:29.113
Thanks.

41:35.661 --> 41:39.123
<i>I changed 1261 to 1216. It was me.</i>

41:39.290 --> 41:41.041
Turn that off. Turn it off.

41:41.208 --> 41:43.836
<i>- It all went exactly--</i>
- Turn it off!

41:44.003 --> 41:45.087
Uh!

41:45.254 --> 41:47.673
You did not hear that!

41:52.428 --> 41:54.013
All right.

41:54.430 --> 41:56.640
Okay, Ernesto...

41:57.057 --> 41:59.685
...this is my fault, not yours.

41:59.852 --> 42:04.857
Um.... But now that you've heard it,
you need to understand something.

42:05.482 --> 42:08.360
You know about confidentiality, right?

42:08.527 --> 42:12.448
As employees of Hamlin Hamlin McGill,
we are both bound by the strictures...

42:12.615 --> 42:14.450
...of client confidentiality.

42:14.617 --> 42:17.286
By law. Both of us. By law.

42:17.453 --> 42:18.913
You understand what I'm saying?

42:19.079 --> 42:21.999
- So I'm not supposed to tell anyone?
- That's right.

42:22.166 --> 42:26.629
No matter who, no matter what reasons
you think you might have...

42:26.795 --> 42:29.965
...you must not-- You cannot tell anyone.

42:30.132 --> 42:32.551
There could be terrible consequences.

42:32.718 --> 42:35.679
Life-changing consequences.

42:36.805 --> 42:39.642
And we don't want you to get into trouble.

42:39.808 --> 42:42.228
If something were to happen to you
because of this...

42:42.394 --> 42:44.396
...I'd feel sick about it.

42:46.523 --> 42:48.067
Okay.

42:48.234 --> 42:49.401
Enough said.

42:50.277 --> 42:54.531
I guess I'll go finish
putting away the groceries. Okay?

42:54.698 --> 42:56.742
Thank you, Ernesto.

46:09.393 --> 46:10.769
Hmm....

46:10.936 --> 46:14.481
<i>Tuesday,
high temperatures will be in the mid-60s...</i>

46:14.648 --> 46:17.067
<i>...with five- to 10-mile-per-hour winds...</i>

46:17.234 --> 46:20.404
<i>...but expect scattered showers
Tuesday night with lows in the 40s.</i>

46:20.571 --> 46:24.032
<i>Wednesday will be partly cloudy
with high temperatures in the mid-50s.</i>

46:24.199 --> 46:26.827
<i>The Grants area will have temperatures
in the mid-40s...</i>

46:26.994 --> 46:29.872
<i>...with southwest winds
15 to 20 miles per hour.</i>

46:30.038 --> 46:33.584
<i>Now let's get back to more
of your favourite sound: Souvenir Oldies...</i>

46:33.750 --> 46:37.963
<i>...with the Steve Ricketts Programme
on KDSK, 92. 7 FM.</i>

46:38.130 --> 46:42.593
<i>Thank you, Derek.
Love those temperatures. It's almost like--</i>
