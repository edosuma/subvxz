WEBVTT

00:00.291 --> 00:03.333
I gotta get goin'

00:03.333 --> 00:06.875
a friend of mine

00:08.500 --> 00:11.458
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.166 --> 00:17.583
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.583 --> 00:21.000
I know he's out there

00:24.458 --> 00:27.875
we're so adventurous

00:27.875 --> 00:31.333
and again

00:31.333 --> 00:34.833
and there's nobody home

00:34.833 --> 00:38.208
to count on a friend

00:38.208 --> 00:41.708
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.833 --> 00:45.250
take me, please?

00:45.250 --> 00:48.708
I got to be there

00:50.708 --> 00:54.208
Winnie the Pooh

01:15.833 --> 01:18.708
Ah! Number one, brush teeth.

01:18.708 --> 01:20.125
Done.

01:20.125 --> 01:22.291
Number two, comb ears.

01:24.583 --> 01:29.083
Happiness is making a schedule
and keeping to it.

01:29.083 --> 01:32.291
Ah! Why isn't everyone
as organized as me?

01:32.291 --> 01:33.708
And what's next?

01:33.708 --> 01:36.583
Number three,
prepare for party.

01:36.583 --> 01:37.625
Party?

01:39.000 --> 01:40.416
I forgot!

01:40.416 --> 01:43.000
I have 500 relatives coming
at 6:00!

01:45.583 --> 01:47.833
Oh, my! Oh, my!
I gotta make-- I gotta make--

01:47.833 --> 01:52.291
I've got to make a schedule.

01:52.291 --> 01:55.416
The key to giving
a perfect party

01:55.416 --> 01:59.125
is an airtight schedule.

01:59.125 --> 02:01.708
Just follow your list
of things to do,

02:01.708 --> 02:05.500
and the party will be
a success.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.083
List?
When a tigger gives a party,

02:08.083 --> 02:10.750
he just opens the door
and hopes for the best.

02:10.750 --> 02:12.833
This way's no fun.

02:12.833 --> 02:16.000
Fun? Did you say fun?

02:16.000 --> 02:21.125
This is a party?
Who said anything about fun?

02:21.125 --> 02:23.708
From 3:04 to 3:43,
you'll bake cakes.

02:23.708 --> 02:26.583
- Any questions, Pooh?
- Just one.

02:26.583 --> 02:28.458
How do you bake a cake?

02:28.458 --> 02:30.750
Very simple, Pooh.

02:30.750 --> 02:32.458
Add two egg whites,
one cup of flour,

02:32.458 --> 02:33.708
two cups of sugar,
dash of salt,
pinch of vanilla,

02:33.708 --> 02:34.958
and then throw it
in the oven and bake.

02:34.958 --> 02:36.750
Understand?

02:36.750 --> 02:41.416
It's 3:05, Tigger!
You're falling behind schedule!

02:41.416 --> 02:42.458
Piglet!

02:43.583 --> 02:45.291
Two egg whites.

02:45.291 --> 02:47.458
But they're all white.

02:49.750 --> 02:52.583
No, no, no, no, no!
The decorations are wrong!

02:52.583 --> 02:54.583
This isn't a Halloween party!

02:55.958 --> 02:58.458
One cup of flowers.

03:00.625 --> 03:05.250
I'll save some time and sweep
this dirt under the rug.

03:05.250 --> 03:07.458
Tigger! 3:21!

03:07.458 --> 03:09.125
You should be washing
the windows!

03:09.125 --> 03:11.250
You're behind schedule!

03:11.250 --> 03:13.375
Piglet!

03:13.375 --> 03:16.000
It isn't an Easter party.

03:17.750 --> 03:20.500
Was that one dash of salt?

03:20.500 --> 03:22.375
Or one dish?

03:22.375 --> 03:26.708
Now, we haven't been washing
behind our ears, have we?

03:27.708 --> 03:29.833
Rabbit: Tigger! 33:22!

03:29.833 --> 03:32.083
You're behind schedule again!

03:32.083 --> 03:36.166
It, uh-- It's not
a Christmas party,
either?

03:36.166 --> 03:38.416
- Oh, my!

03:38.416 --> 03:41.166
That's them! I can hear them!
They're coming!

03:41.166 --> 03:43.166
New schedule! New schedule!

03:43.166 --> 03:46.166
Tigger, you no longer
have 10 minutes to dust!
You have 10 seconds!

03:46.166 --> 03:49.708
- Piglet!
-

03:52.416 --> 03:56.250
- It's party time!
- No, no, no, no!

03:56.250 --> 03:59.333
No, no, no! Go away!
Shoo! Shoo!

03:59.333 --> 04:01.458
Come back in two hours!

04:01.458 --> 04:04.208
Why don't you have
the party now, Rabbit?

04:04.208 --> 04:07.000
Because it isn't
on the schedule.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.583
I know!

04:13.750 --> 04:16.875
Now, you bunnies go
into the bedroom

04:16.875 --> 04:18.416
with your Uncle Piglet--

04:18.416 --> 04:20.500
- ...while he reads you a story

04:20.500 --> 04:23.875
for the next two hours.

04:27.250 --> 04:29.750
Oh, dear.

04:29.750 --> 04:34.166
Once upon a time,
a long time ago...

04:34.166 --> 04:36.958
You're taking too long,
Pooh!

04:36.958 --> 04:38.291
Time is wasting.

04:41.958 --> 04:47.333
Hello, Rabbit.
Just came over to see
how everything's going.

04:48.833 --> 04:51.625
Boom! Went the big, mean giant

04:51.625 --> 04:53.625
as he jumped off the beanstalk.

04:56.458 --> 04:59.166
Just look at this mess.

05:00.833 --> 05:02.625
And now the honey's gone!

05:04.708 --> 05:07.500
I can get some more.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.333
You bake another cake, Pooh.

05:09.333 --> 05:11.250
Gopher, you get us
some more honey.

05:11.250 --> 05:13.000
You have-- Oh, no!

05:13.000 --> 05:14.875
Fifteen minutes!

05:14.875 --> 05:16.458
Hurry! Hurry!

05:16.458 --> 05:19.208
We've gotta get back
on schedule!

05:25.875 --> 05:29.375
There. Everything's ready.

05:29.375 --> 05:31.708
Right on schedule.

05:31.708 --> 05:35.500
Then the big, mean giant
gobbled up the whole village...

05:35.500 --> 05:37.708
and lived happily ever after.

05:37.708 --> 05:38.708
The end.

05:44.708 --> 05:47.708
Where did the schedules say
bunnies cry?

05:47.708 --> 05:49.708
Where? Show me where?

05:49.708 --> 05:52.875
Oh, Rabbit, I'm very sorry.

05:52.875 --> 05:56.416
Rabbit:
There's no time for sorry!

05:56.416 --> 05:59.708
Keep these creatures occupied
for the next hour.

05:59.708 --> 06:02.500
Take them for a walk.
Anything!

06:02.500 --> 06:05.375
If I'm going to have
this party,

06:05.375 --> 06:08.083
and I am going to have
this party,

06:08.083 --> 06:09.875
I have to get things ready!

06:14.750 --> 06:18.750
Give me 15 minutes
to get honey, will he?

06:18.750 --> 06:21.958
I'll get it in 10.

06:21.958 --> 06:24.250
I know how to keep a schedule.

06:28.750 --> 06:33.083
- Yow!
-

06:49.625 --> 06:51.833
It seems the only way

06:51.833 --> 06:54.583
to get things done
in a timely, efficient manner

06:54.583 --> 06:56.833
is to do them myself.

07:27.708 --> 07:29.583
And halt.

07:29.583 --> 07:32.458
Uh, what are we stopping for,
Pooh Boy?

07:32.458 --> 07:37.000
If we hike too far,
we won't be back in time
for Rabbit's party.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.833
Yeah. Good idea.

07:39.833 --> 07:43.166
About face.

07:43.166 --> 07:45.833
Oh, no! Look!

07:48.833 --> 07:50.375
Oh, bother.

07:53.750 --> 07:57.166
Done with 2.8 seconds
to spare.

07:57.166 --> 08:00.875
Let the party begin!

08:02.833 --> 08:07.166
Uh, why, oh,
where is everyone?

08:07.166 --> 08:12.000
I distinctly told them
to be here at 6:00 sharp.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.166
It's right here
on the schedule.

08:15.750 --> 08:18.875
Ah! Must still be at Pooh's.

08:18.875 --> 08:23.750
Those little insects think they
can throw me off schedule, huh?

08:23.750 --> 08:25.458
I'll show 'em.

08:28.958 --> 08:30.958
Better add some more.

08:30.958 --> 08:33.875
I wanna do this right
the first time.

08:38.583 --> 08:40.875
Where could they be?

08:40.875 --> 08:43.458
Oh! They must be at Piglet's.

08:43.458 --> 08:45.708
Calling all bunnies.

08:45.708 --> 08:48.000
Calling all bunnies.

08:57.416 --> 08:59.458
Excuse me, Gopher.

08:59.458 --> 09:02.250
Have you seen
any bunnies about?

09:02.250 --> 09:05.375
Don't bother me now, sonny.

09:05.375 --> 09:07.708
Can't you see
I'm behind schedule?

09:07.708 --> 09:11.083
Oh, bother!
We must find them soon,

09:11.083 --> 09:13.166
or-- or--

09:13.166 --> 09:16.458
Why must we find them soon?

09:16.458 --> 09:17.583
Rabbit's party.

09:17.583 --> 09:20.708
Here, bunny, bunny, bunnies.

09:20.708 --> 09:23.458
Not at Piglet's,
not at Tigger's.

09:23.458 --> 09:25.291
Where is everyone?

09:25.291 --> 09:28.375
They know they're supposed
to be here on schedule.

09:28.375 --> 09:32.125
Well, I planned
this party for 6:00,

09:32.125 --> 09:35.000
and it is 6:00.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.125
I'll show them!

09:37.125 --> 09:40.875
Come out, come out,
wherever you bunnies are!

09:42.875 --> 09:44.708
Follow them fuzzballs!

09:46.583 --> 09:49.583
Whoa! You little bunnies!

09:52.458 --> 09:54.291
That a away to the party.

10:05.708 --> 10:08.333
Another slice of cake?
Of course, Piglet.

10:10.083 --> 10:14.166
Now, do you know what's next
on the schedule?

10:14.166 --> 10:16.833
Charades! Won't that be fun?

10:19.083 --> 10:22.083
Pooh, would you start?

10:22.083 --> 10:24.750
Go ahead, Pooh.
Don't be bashful.

10:24.750 --> 10:27.958
Isn't this fun?

10:31.833 --> 10:35.291
But we're supposed
to be having fun.

10:35.291 --> 10:36.833
It's on the schedule.

10:36.833 --> 10:39.708
It's on... the schedule.

10:39.708 --> 10:42.208
How many more, Piglet?

10:44.291 --> 10:47.708
Whew!
That's the last of them.

10:52.375 --> 10:55.208
My goodness.
What want that?

11:04.875 --> 11:08.000
I believe we're rather
a bit late.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
I'm sorry, Rabbit.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.416
We've ruined your schedule,
haven't we?

11:14.416 --> 11:17.000
Guess there won't be
any party, huh?

11:17.000 --> 11:19.750
Of course,
there'll be a party!

11:24.583 --> 11:28.083
Why, who needs a schedule
for a party?

11:28.083 --> 11:30.291
Parties are supposed to be fun.

11:30.291 --> 11:35.416
And you can have fun
whenever you want.

11:35.416 --> 11:37.125
Ahh...

11:51.833 --> 11:54.708
Help! Help! Tigger!

11:54.708 --> 11:56.000
Tigger, you gotta save me!

11:56.000 --> 11:58.875
Save my bestest buddy?

11:58.875 --> 12:01.166
Why, that's what
tiggers do best!

12:01.166 --> 12:04.708
I'll box 'em, I'll trounce 'em,
I'll "massacrate" 'em!

12:08.166 --> 12:10.500
Who did you say was after you?

12:10.500 --> 12:13.875
My mama!
She wants to give me a bath!

12:13.875 --> 12:15.958
A bath!

12:15.958 --> 12:19.291
But everybody knows
baths is bad for you.

12:19.291 --> 12:21.250
- Yeah!
- Besides!

12:21.250 --> 12:23.750
What's wrong
with being dirty?

12:23.750 --> 12:25.083
Yeah!

12:25.083 --> 12:27.750
You'll never catch me
taking one.

12:27.750 --> 12:30.000
- Oh, Roo!
- Quick, hide!

12:32.750 --> 12:34.708
There.
All this rhododendron needs is

12:34.708 --> 12:38.458
- a little sunshine and--
- Tigger: Help!

12:38.458 --> 12:39.875
Help! Help!

12:39.875 --> 12:42.708
Piglet! Piglet!
You gotta hide us!

12:42.708 --> 12:45.500
We're fugitives from justice.

12:45.500 --> 12:47.208
- But--
- If Roo gets caught,

12:47.208 --> 12:49.958
- it's the end.
- Kanga: Hello!

12:51.291 --> 12:52.500
Roo: I was here first!

12:52.500 --> 12:53.750
Tigger:
Let go of my tail.

12:53.750 --> 12:55.333
Roo:
Go see who it is, Tigger.

12:55.333 --> 12:57.875
Tigger: Yeah,
go see who it is, Piglet.

12:59.250 --> 13:02.000
Yoo-hoo! Piglet!

13:02.000 --> 13:04.166
Why, it's only Kanga!

13:04.166 --> 13:05.458
Kanga!

13:05.458 --> 13:07.625
Hide me! Hide me!

13:07.625 --> 13:09.833
This way! Quick! Under here!

13:11.000 --> 13:13.291
Nah. Too obvious. Aha!

13:14.750 --> 13:17.208
My rhododendron!

13:17.208 --> 13:20.208
It's a "Roododendron" now.

13:20.208 --> 13:23.625
Piglet? Isn't anyone home?

13:23.625 --> 13:26.125
Oh, hello, Kanga.

13:26.125 --> 13:28.500
I was just--

13:28.500 --> 13:30.333
Sorry to bother you, Piglet.

13:30.333 --> 13:31.458
I just wanted to know if--

13:31.458 --> 13:33.000
Tigger: Roo were here?

13:33.000 --> 13:35.458
Nope! No Roo here.

13:35.458 --> 13:37.208
Just this plant.

13:37.208 --> 13:40.875
Actually, Tigger, dear, I just
came to borrow some bubbly bath.

13:40.875 --> 13:43.875
Oh, I guess, I, uh...

13:43.875 --> 13:49.166
A lot of weather we've been
having lately, huh. Mrs. Kanga?

13:49.166 --> 13:52.416
Oh, yes. Quite alto.

13:52.416 --> 13:56.208
But not nearly as much
as last week.

13:56.208 --> 13:57.250
Here's the bubbly bath,
Kanga.

13:57.250 --> 13:58.833
Thank you, Piglet.

13:58.833 --> 14:00.208
Oh, look at the time!

14:00.208 --> 14:01.708
I really must be going.

14:03.833 --> 14:06.625
- Oh, boy.
- Kanga: I almost forgot.

14:06.625 --> 14:09.208
- Come along, dear.
- Roo: Oh, Mom.

14:09.208 --> 14:11.000
- I don't wanna!
- Oh, no!

14:11.000 --> 14:12.625
- She's got 'em.
- Can't I stay?

14:12.625 --> 14:16.583
Come on, Piglet.
We gotta save the little feller.

14:18.166 --> 14:22.333
But, Tigger,
save him from what?

14:22.333 --> 14:25.375
Believe me, buddy bear,
you don't wanna know.

14:25.375 --> 14:28.500
It's too horrible.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.333
it's hot and "humidy"

14:32.416 --> 14:35.125
and they haven't started yet

14:35.125 --> 14:36.958
in a steamy vat

14:38.625 --> 14:40.000
the slippery walls

14:46.416 --> 14:48.000
in your mouth

14:49.583 --> 14:51.333
all the "wrinklage"

14:51.333 --> 14:52.958
smaller

14:52.958 --> 14:54.583
some shrinkage

14:56.375 --> 14:57.583
He's all washed up.

14:59.083 --> 15:01.458
We've lost
our furry friend.

15:01.458 --> 15:04.458
to Roo

15:11.083 --> 15:13.583
Oh, my. What can we do?

15:13.583 --> 15:16.000
There's only one thing to do.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.625
But we'll need a very small
animal like you to do it.

15:19.625 --> 15:21.166
- Me?
- Yeah!

15:21.166 --> 15:23.708
While Pooh Boy here
distracts Kanga,

15:23.708 --> 15:25.583
I'll grab Roo.

15:25.583 --> 15:27.708
Then you'll jump
into her pouch,

15:27.708 --> 15:28.875
and she'll think you're him.

15:30.291 --> 15:32.291
And then?

15:32.291 --> 15:35.750
Then when she discovers
the old switcheroo,

15:35.750 --> 15:38.750
we'll all shout, Ha-ha!"

15:38.750 --> 15:41.333
- All of us?
- Yeah!

15:41.333 --> 15:44.375
She'll be so surprised,

15:44.375 --> 15:46.875
She'll forget all about
this whole horrible thing.

15:46.875 --> 15:49.000
There's no other way?

15:49.000 --> 15:52.875
It's this or the end.

15:54.625 --> 15:55.708
Oh, dear.

15:57.583 --> 16:01.291
Now, Roo, dear,
it won't be that bad.

16:01.291 --> 16:05.333
No, Mama, it'll be worse!

16:05.333 --> 16:08.833
Okay, buddy bear,
you know what to do?

16:08.833 --> 16:11.000
No.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.583
That's great!

16:13.583 --> 16:15.375
Go do it!

16:17.000 --> 16:18.458
Hello, Kanga?

16:18.458 --> 16:20.875
Why, hello, Pooh Bear.

16:20.875 --> 16:23.291
I was just wondering--

16:23.291 --> 16:24.958
I mean, uh--

16:24.958 --> 16:27.291
Did I happen
to mention--

16:27.291 --> 16:29.333
That is--

16:29.333 --> 16:31.458
Have you ever
noticed that...

16:31.458 --> 16:33.291
tree over there?

16:33.291 --> 16:34.875
Why, yes, Pooh.

16:34.875 --> 16:36.875
It's a very nice tree.

16:36.875 --> 16:40.250
It has leaves and everything.

16:40.250 --> 16:43.166
Pooh: Now, about that tree.

16:43.166 --> 16:46.333
I think I can see a bird
in it from here.

16:46.333 --> 16:51.875
- Kanga: A bird?
- Pooh: Yes. Unless,
of course, it's a fish.

16:51.875 --> 16:56.458
Kanga: Oh... I don't see
a bird or a fish.

16:56.458 --> 17:00.500
Oh, I must have been wrong.

17:00.500 --> 17:02.750
Oh, going so soon?

17:02.750 --> 17:07.250
I think I remember something
I have to do suddenly.

17:07.250 --> 17:09.708
Well, we must be going, too.

17:09.708 --> 17:12.250
- Isn't that right, Roo, dear?
- Mm-hmm.

17:12.250 --> 17:13.708
Good-bye, Pooh!

17:13.708 --> 17:16.166
Bye-bye.

17:16.166 --> 17:19.250
Oh, boy! You saved me!

17:19.250 --> 17:23.500
Yeah, we sure pulled
the old switcheroo,
didn't we?

17:23.500 --> 17:26.958
Come on, Roo!
Let's find the muddiest
mud puddle there is

17:26.958 --> 17:28.708
and jump in!

17:30.500 --> 17:32.458
Roo?

17:32.458 --> 17:36.250
I've got a funny feeling
we've forgotten something.

17:41.291 --> 17:43.458
- Now then, Roo, dear--
- Uh-huh.

17:43.458 --> 17:45.458
Uh-huh?

17:45.458 --> 17:47.583
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

17:47.583 --> 17:51.125
What's wrong, Roo, dear?
Water too cold?

17:51.125 --> 17:53.250
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

17:53.250 --> 17:55.958
Oh, you want more bubbles.

17:55.958 --> 17:59.958
Kanga, I see the time has come
to speak plainly.

17:59.958 --> 18:02.291
Funny, little Roo.

18:02.291 --> 18:05.083
But I'm not Roo, I'm Piglet.

18:05.083 --> 18:07.583
Why, of course you are, dear.

18:07.583 --> 18:10.291
And imitating
Piglet's voice, too.

18:10.291 --> 18:11.750
How clever.

18:11.750 --> 18:13.583
But, Kanga, look at me.

18:13.583 --> 18:16.000
I am looking, Roo, dear.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.833
And I told you yesterday,

18:17.833 --> 18:20.500
if you keep making faces
like a piglet,

18:20.500 --> 18:22.583
you'll grow up
to look like a piglet.

18:22.583 --> 18:24.708
And then think
how sorry you'll be.

18:24.708 --> 18:26.375
But, but, but--

18:26.375 --> 18:29.166
- Scrubbly-bubbly!
- But...

18:29.166 --> 18:32.625
Getting dirty is great!

18:32.625 --> 18:36.833
Yeah! Better than getting
some icky old bath.

18:36.833 --> 18:39.833
Yahoo!

18:39.833 --> 18:43.583
- Yahoo!
-

18:43.583 --> 18:48.000
Hey, let's see who can blow
the biggest bubble.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.458
Yeah!

18:49.458 --> 18:51.333
On your mark.

18:51.333 --> 18:53.000
Get set.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.750
Go!

19:04.125 --> 19:06.291
A sticky "predicalment."

19:12.875 --> 19:16.416
Tigger, being dirty is fun,

19:16.416 --> 19:20.291
but, uh, maybe we need
some help?

19:20.291 --> 19:23.958
You may have a point there,
Roo, old boy.

19:32.250 --> 19:34.000
Why, hello, Pooh.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Excuse me, Kanga,

19:36.000 --> 19:38.708
but I believe
I forgot to say,

19:38.708 --> 19:40.000
"Aha!"

19:40.000 --> 19:41.333
Pooh?

19:41.333 --> 19:43.500
Oh, Pooh, tell her who I am.

19:45.416 --> 19:49.500
She keeps saying I'm Roo,
but I'm not Roo...

19:49.500 --> 19:50.833
am I?

19:50.833 --> 19:53.458
Well, you can't be Roo,

19:53.458 --> 19:56.416
because Roo is out playing
with Tigger.

19:56.416 --> 19:58.958
Almost there, Roo boy.

19:58.958 --> 20:01.875
But then whoever can this be?

20:01.875 --> 20:03.875
I'm not quite sure.

20:07.958 --> 20:10.500
Whoa!

20:10.500 --> 20:14.125
Wait, whoever you are!
Please come back!

20:16.458 --> 20:18.708
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!

20:22.583 --> 20:23.583
Piglet?

20:26.208 --> 20:30.166
Why, Piglet!
It's you!

20:30.166 --> 20:34.083
Yes, Pooh. That's what
I was trying to tell you.

20:34.083 --> 20:37.458
But, Piglet,
you didn't look like you.

20:37.458 --> 20:40.375
But now you do.

20:40.375 --> 20:42.000
And I'm glad.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.833
Me, too, Pooh...

20:43.833 --> 20:45.708
very, very glad.

20:51.166 --> 20:54.958
Mama, can't you get us
unstuck?

20:54.958 --> 20:57.708
But, Roo, dear,

20:57.708 --> 20:59.333
Tigger's your friend.

20:59.333 --> 21:02.500
Don't you want
to be dirty together?

21:02.500 --> 21:04.958
Oh, yeah,
but what about the times

21:04.958 --> 21:07.208
we want to be dirty together

21:07.208 --> 21:10.208
by ourselves?

21:10.208 --> 21:13.000
Oh, all right.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.291
But I'm afraid the only way
to get you apart

21:16.291 --> 21:17.708
is a bath.

21:17.708 --> 21:19.708
Both: No! No!

21:19.708 --> 21:21.250
No! Not that!

21:21.250 --> 21:22.833
I'm "allergical" to water.

21:22.833 --> 21:25.250
I break out in clean spots!

21:25.250 --> 21:28.000
If I take bath,

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
it's the end.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.583
Scrubbly-bubbly.

21:31.583 --> 21:34.833
No! No! I'm too young to bathe!

21:38.458 --> 21:41.166
You see what happens
when you get in a bath?

21:41.166 --> 21:43.375
You get, uh...

21:43.375 --> 21:45.708
You get, uh...

21:45.708 --> 21:47.458
clean!

21:48.583 --> 21:50.458
Squeaky clean!

21:50.458 --> 21:52.875
Yeah! This is fun!

21:52.875 --> 21:55.583
You know, it's a lot
like being dirty,

21:55.583 --> 21:57.708
only not.

21:59.416 --> 22:02.708
Maybe we should do this again,
like next year.

22:02.708 --> 22:07.333
See? taking a bath isn't
so bad, is it, Tigger?

22:07.333 --> 22:10.166
No. But I was right
about one thing.

22:10.166 --> 22:12.625
It is the end.

22:15.708 --> 22:16.708
See?

22:57.291 --> 23:00.708
Winnie the Pooh Bear

23:02.750 --> 23:04.458
take me, please?

23:04.458 --> 23:07.625
I got to be there

23:09.583 --> 23:14.875
Winnie the Pooh
