<i>No, we have to get out of his place now.</i>
<i>It's an uncomfortable situation.</i>

11:11.560 --> 11:15.473
Why would somebody sell

11:15.560 --> 11:19.269
Who knows?
A divorce, loan sharks...

11:19.360 --> 11:21.191
drugs, sudden death.

11:21.280 --> 11:25.592
The point is: You get to capitalize

Anna, I have learned
that my life is meaningless without you.

11:48.360 --> 11:50.396
I know we made
a mess of things before...

11:50.480 --> 11:53.756
but I wanna put the past behind us
and begin again fresh...

11:53.840 --> 11:56.559
and at the same time
older and wiser.

11:56.640 --> 11:58.471
-Can we do that?
-No.

11:58.560 --> 12:01.438
-What do you mean "no"? Why not?
-I love Walter.

12:01.520 --> 12:05.115
-"Walter"? What Walter?
-Oh, Max, you know exactly what Walter.

12:05.200 --> 12:09.079
-Don't be ridiculous.
He's not even a musician.
-Many people aren't.

12:09.160 --> 12:11.196
Anna, please,
I have finally discovered...

12:11.280 --> 12:14.078
there is only one person
in the world who matters to me.

12:14.160 --> 12:16.628
And that's you.
I've known that for a long time.

12:16.720 --> 12:19.154
No. You love me,

-Max, it's over for us. Over.

-Walter!
-Hey, how are ya?

12:56.040 --> 12:58.838

-We want to change the name of the band.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.789

-No, in fact, considering your act...

18:06.360 --> 18:08.316
You go to Motor Vehicles
to get your licence renewed...

18:08.400 --> 18:10.755
and you get on this line
that reaches to Spain.

18:10.840 --> 18:13.718
And right next to it is this little
short line with only two guys on it.

18:13.800 --> 18:16.792
But you don't get on that line, 'cause you
think something must be wrong with it...

18:16.880 --> 18:20.031

on it, so you waste three hours.
