WEBVTT

00:12.200 --> 00:13.467
- HEY, RAY,

00:13.467 --> 00:15.400
I WAS CLEANING OUT
THE BASEMENT AND--

00:15.400 --> 00:17.767
BY THE WAY, DID YOU KNOW
YOUR FAMILY'S DOWNSTAIRS?

00:17.767 --> 00:21.667
- WHY DO YOU THINK
I'M UPSTAIRS?

00:21.667 --> 00:24.933
- WHY DO YOU THINK
I'M CLEANING OUT THE BASEMENT?

00:24.933 --> 00:26.300
ANYWAY, I WAS DOWN THERE,

00:26.300 --> 00:28.067
AND I CAME ACROSS A BOX
OF YOUR OLD TROPHIES.

00:28.067 --> 00:30.200
- WHAT, MY FOOSBALL TROPHIES?

00:30.200 --> 00:34.667
- NO, YOUR NOBEL PRIZES.

00:34.667 --> 00:35.667
AND LOOK AT THIS.

00:35.667 --> 00:36.867
I FOUND THIS IN THERE.

00:36.867 --> 00:37.933
- WHAT?

00:37.933 --> 00:38.933
- THIS TAPE.

00:38.933 --> 00:40.600
IT SAYS "KAREN 1982" ON IT.

00:45.333 --> 00:46.733
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

00:49.333 --> 00:51.833
- SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING
FROM YOUR COLLEGE DAYS.

00:51.833 --> 00:53.500
WHO'S "KAREN 1982"?

00:53.500 --> 00:55.200
- I DON'T KNOW,
JUST SOME GIRL,

00:55.200 --> 00:56.767
SOME NOBODY
FROM THE EARLY '80s,

00:56.767 --> 00:58.700
NOBODY YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT.

00:58.700 --> 00:59.767
- HERE, LET'S PLAY IT.

00:59.767 --> 01:01.400
- NO! NO, NO!
YOU DON'T PLAY IT!

01:01.400 --> 01:04.000
- RELAX, RELAX.
I'VE HEARD IT ALREADY.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.333
- WHAT?
YOU ALREADY LISTENED TO IT?

01:06.333 --> 01:08.633
THAT SEEMS LIKE
AN INVASION OF EVERYTHING!

01:08.633 --> 01:10.167
- I KNOW.
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.

01:10.167 --> 01:11.567
HERE WE GO.

01:11.567 --> 01:12.933
[rock music plays]

01:12.933 --> 01:15.700
- HI, THIS IS RAY.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.067
IF I'M NOT HERE,

01:17.067 --> 01:19.833
I'M PROBABLY HANGING AT
THE QUAD WITH MY GIRL, KAREN.

01:19.833 --> 01:20.833
YOU KNOW IT!

01:20.833 --> 01:22.233
[beeps]

01:22.233 --> 01:23.800
- RAY, IT'S KAREN.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.500
LISTEN, THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO SAY.

01:26.500 --> 01:29.267
I WANTED TO TELL YOU
AT THE KAPPA DELT HOEDOWN,

01:29.267 --> 01:33.233
BUT YOU WERE HAVING SO MUCH FUN
PLAYING FOOSBALL, SO...

01:33.233 --> 01:36.067
WELL, I'LL JUST SAY IT.

01:36.067 --> 01:37.433
I WAS THINKING THAT

01:37.433 --> 01:39.867
MAYBE WE SHOULD START
SEEING OTHER PEOPLE

01:39.867 --> 01:43.833
AND, YOU KNOW,
NOT EACH OTHER.

01:43.833 --> 01:46.467
I'M SORRY TO KIND OF BREAK UP
AND EVERYTHING ON THE PHONE,

01:46.467 --> 01:49.133
BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO--

01:49.133 --> 01:51.933
ANYWAY.
OKAY, I GOT TO GO.

01:51.933 --> 01:55.467
AND YOU SHOULD CHANGE
YOUR OUTGOING MESSAGE, OKAY?

01:55.467 --> 01:57.367
BYE.

01:59.900 --> 02:02.333
- I WAS WONDERING WHY
SHE HADN'T CALLED.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.367
- I DON'T GET IT, RAY.

02:07.367 --> 02:08.800
WHY WOULD YOU KEEP
A TAPE OF A GIRL

02:08.800 --> 02:09.800
BREAKING UP WITH YOU?

02:09.800 --> 02:10.800
- I DIDN'T KEEP IT.

02:10.800 --> 02:11.967
- OH, IT'S OKAY.

02:11.967 --> 02:13.400
YOU CAN KEEP
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.767
I'M JUST CURIOUS.
- I DIDN'T KEEP IT!

02:19.267 --> 02:20.633
- COME ON, RAY,
YOU KEPT IT.

02:20.633 --> 02:22.367
YOU TOOK IT OUT OF
THE ANSWERING MACHINE,

02:22.367 --> 02:24.400
YOU LABELED IT,
AND YOU PLACED IT IN A BOX

02:24.400 --> 02:26.633
ALONG WITH A BUNCH
OF LAME FOOSBALL TROPHIES.

02:26.633 --> 02:28.867
- LAME?

02:28.867 --> 02:35.300
I WAS PLAYING AT A LEVEL
THAT YOU WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND.

02:35.300 --> 02:39.567
- AND I NOTICED YOU TOOK
THE TIME TO POP OUT THE TABS,

02:39.567 --> 02:43.100
WHICH YOU NEGLECTED TO DO
WITH OUR WEDDING VIDEO.

02:45.367 --> 02:46.800
- ALL RIGHT.
SO YOU'RE JEALOUS.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.000
- HONEY, I'M NOT JEALOUS!
I'M NOT.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.467
I JUST THINK
IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD

02:50.467 --> 02:52.400
THAT YOU WOULD KEEP
A BREAKUP TAPE FOR 20 YEARS.

02:52.400 --> 02:54.033
- I DON'T SEE HOW THAT'S WEIRD.

02:54.033 --> 02:55.500
- A BREAKUP TAPE?

02:55.500 --> 02:58.500
THAT'S LIKE KEEPING
A HANGNAIL.

02:58.500 --> 02:59.933
- NO, IT'S NOT.
OKAY?

02:59.933 --> 03:01.667
THERE'S PLENTY OF PEOPLE
THAT WOULD KEEP THIS.

03:01.667 --> 03:02.800
- WHO?
- ANYBODY!

03:02.800 --> 03:03.900
- NOBODY.

03:03.900 --> 03:06.200
- NOT NOBODY,
BECAUSE I-BODY!

03:07.900 --> 03:09.467
- "I-BODY"?

03:09.467 --> 03:11.767
YOU KNOW, THE HARDEST THING
TO BELIEVE ABOUT THIS TAPE

03:11.767 --> 03:13.300
IS THAT YOU WENT TO COLLEGE.

03:13.300 --> 03:15.000
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
JUST GIVE ME MY TAPE.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.567
- WHEN YOU TELL ME
WHY YOU KEEP IT.

03:16.567 --> 03:18.233
- I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU
ANYTHING, ALL RIGHT?

03:18.233 --> 03:20.133
WHAT YOU DID
IS UNCONSCIONABLE.

03:20.133 --> 03:22.300
THAT'S RIGHT,
THERE'S YOUR COLLEGE.

03:25.233 --> 03:26.467
- WHY ARE WE YELLING?

03:26.467 --> 03:28.300
- OH, JEEZ, MA,
NOBODY'S YELLING.

03:28.300 --> 03:30.000
- THEN WHY AM I UP HERE?

03:30.000 --> 03:32.067
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

03:32.067 --> 03:33.500
- HEY, WHAT'S WITH
THE YELLING?

03:33.500 --> 03:34.833
- YEAH,
WHAT'S WITH THE YELLING?

03:34.833 --> 03:38.000
- OH, COME ON.
COULD EVERYBODY PLEASE GO?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.433
- WHY ARE YOU
IN YOUR UNDERWEAR?

03:39.433 --> 03:42.567
- BECAUSE THIS IS MY BEDROOM!

03:42.567 --> 03:44.267
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GLAD YOU'RE ALL HERE.

03:44.267 --> 03:45.267
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

03:45.267 --> 03:46.900
DO YOU THINK IT'S WEIRD

03:46.900 --> 03:49.033
THAT SOMEONE WOULD KEEP A TAPE
OF SOMEONE BREAKING UP WITH THEM

03:49.033 --> 03:50.033
FOR 20 YEARS?

03:50.033 --> 03:51.733
- "KAREN 1982"?

03:53.433 --> 03:55.233
- HOW THE HELL
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

03:55.233 --> 03:56.800
- I CAME ACROSS IT ONE DAY

03:56.800 --> 04:00.233
WHEN I WAS DRAWING GENITALS
ON YOUR FOOSBALL TROPHIES.

04:00.233 --> 04:03.800
- YOU REALLY ARE A MENTAL CASE,
YOU KNOW THAT?

04:03.800 --> 04:05.067
- SO THIS KAREN BROAD

04:05.067 --> 04:06.900
DUMPED YOU OVER THE PHONE
ON A TAPE?

04:06.900 --> 04:09.267
[chuckling]

04:09.267 --> 04:12.333
- YOU NEVER TOLD ME ANYTHING
ABOUT A KAREN.

04:12.333 --> 04:14.133
HOW LONG DID YOU TWO DATE?

04:14.133 --> 04:16.433
- I DON'T KNOW,
LIKE, FIVE MONTHS.

04:16.433 --> 04:18.267
- YOU WENT TOGETHER
FIVE MONTHS,

04:18.267 --> 04:20.133
AND THIS IS HOW
I FIND OUT ABOUT IT?

04:20.133 --> 04:23.000
- OH, COME ON, MA!
IT WAS 20 YEARS AGO!

04:23.000 --> 04:25.067
- WHAT WERE YOU
DOING WITH HER?

04:25.067 --> 04:26.633
- NOTHING
THAT KEPT HER HAPPY.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.267
- I GOT TO TELL YA,

04:32.267 --> 04:33.833
BREAKIN' UP
ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE

04:33.833 --> 04:35.333
IS THE WAY TO GO.

04:35.333 --> 04:37.000
IF THOSE THINGS
WERE AROUND IN MY DAY,

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD
TO MOVE SO MUCH.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.800
- BUT NOBODY THINKS IT'S ODD

04:45.800 --> 04:48.333
THAT SOMEONE WOULD KEEP
A TAPE LIKE THIS?

04:48.333 --> 04:50.567
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS.
IT'S DUMB.

04:50.567 --> 04:53.200
YOU SHOULD GET RID OF
ALL EVIDENCE OF THE PAST.

04:53.200 --> 04:56.133
- I KEPT EVERYTHING
FROM MY PAST RELATIONSHIPS.

04:56.133 --> 04:57.567
- SHE HAD TO.

04:57.567 --> 05:00.033
IT'S TOUGH
TO THROW OUT A CAVE PAINTING.

05:05.800 --> 05:08.367
- I MEAN, I KEEP THINGS TOO,
BUT THEY'RE--

05:08.367 --> 05:10.133
THEY'RE HAPPY THINGS.

05:10.133 --> 05:12.200
YOU KNOW, A LETTER
OR PICTURES.

05:12.200 --> 05:13.867
SOMEONE WROTE ME
A POEM ONCE.

05:13.867 --> 05:15.233
- POEM?
FROM WHO?

05:15.233 --> 05:18.067
WHAT POEM?
WHO WRITES YOU POEMS?

05:18.067 --> 05:19.700
- JUST A GUY I KNEW
IN THE 10TH GRADE.

05:19.700 --> 05:22.233
BUT IT'S A HAPPY POEM,
MAKES ME SMILE WHEN I READ IT.

05:22.233 --> 05:23.667
- YOU STILL READ IT?

05:23.667 --> 05:25.767
- I HAVE, ONCE OR TWICE.

05:25.767 --> 05:27.767
- [gasps]

05:29.167 --> 05:30.967
- YOU NEVER TOLD ME
ABOUT A POEM.

05:30.967 --> 05:35.033
- BURN EVERYTHING, I TELL YA.

05:35.033 --> 05:37.133
- SUCH SECRETS
FROM YOUR HUSBAND.

05:37.133 --> 05:39.100
- I'M NOT KEEPING SECRETS!

05:39.100 --> 05:40.533
RAY, I DIDN'T TELL YOU

05:40.533 --> 05:42.400
BECAUSE EVERY TIME I MENTION
AN OLD BOYFRIEND,

05:42.400 --> 05:43.633
YOU SAY,
"I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT."

05:43.633 --> 05:45.067
HE DOESN'T WANT
TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

05:45.067 --> 05:47.400
LOOK, LOOK, THIS IS NOT UNUSUAL.

05:47.400 --> 05:48.867
EVERYBODY KEEPS NICE STUFF.

05:48.867 --> 05:51.767
WHAT THEY DON'T KEEP
ARE BREAKUP TAPES.

05:53.333 --> 05:54.533
FORGET IT.
JUST FORGET IT!

05:54.533 --> 05:55.733
YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S NICE?

05:55.733 --> 05:57.367
IN THE BASEMENT.

05:58.933 --> 06:00.433
- CAN I HEAR
THAT KAREN TAPE?

06:00.433 --> 06:04.200
- NO, NO, NO.
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

06:05.067 --> 06:06.633
- I HAVE A COPY.

06:18.333 --> 06:20.267
- OKAY, DEBRA.
I WAS THINKING.

06:20.267 --> 06:21.867
I NOW UNDERSTAND
THAT IT IS KIND OF WEIRD

06:21.867 --> 06:23.067
TO KEEP THAT TAPE.

06:23.067 --> 06:24.300
- RAY, CAN WE JUST DROP
THE WHOLE THING?

06:24.300 --> 06:25.567
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

06:25.567 --> 06:27.033
I WISH THAT I HAD TOLD YOU
ABOUT IT.

06:27.033 --> 06:28.100
- OKAY.

06:28.100 --> 06:29.133
I SHOULD'VE BEEN MORE OPEN.

06:29.133 --> 06:30.633
WE SHOULD BE MORE OPEN.

06:30.633 --> 06:32.533
I THINK FROM NOW ON,
WE SHOULD BOTH BE OPEN, OKAY?

06:32.533 --> 06:35.767
LET'S CONSIDER THIS
"OPENING NIGHT."

06:35.767 --> 06:36.767
- RAY.

06:36.767 --> 06:38.200
- IN THIS SHOEBOX,

06:38.200 --> 06:40.467
I HAVE EVERYTHING
FROM MY PAST RELATIONSHIPS.

06:40.467 --> 06:41.600
- YEAH?

06:41.600 --> 06:43.200
- YEAH, AND I'M GONNA
SHOW IT TO YOU

06:43.200 --> 06:46.833
JUST TO SHOW YOU THAT,
YOU KNOW, I CAN SHOW.

06:46.833 --> 06:48.000
- GREAT, IF YOU WANT.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.600
- YES, I DO. I DO.
I REALLY DO.

06:52.900 --> 06:54.467
YOU FIRST.

06:55.967 --> 06:56.967
- WHAT?

06:56.967 --> 06:58.267
- WELL, YOU GOT A POEM.

06:58.267 --> 06:59.833
YOU SAID THERE'S
SOME OTHER STUFF.

06:59.833 --> 07:01.067
I WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

07:01.067 --> 07:02.267
- WHY?

07:02.267 --> 07:04.800
- ARE WE GONNA BE OPEN
OR NOT?

07:04.800 --> 07:06.067
- YEAH.

07:06.067 --> 07:07.567
I MEAN, OF COURSE
I WANT TO BE OPEN.

07:07.567 --> 07:09.067
BUT I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE DOING THIS

07:09.067 --> 07:10.200
FOR THE RIGHT REASON.

07:11.267 --> 07:12.767
- IS WANTING TO BE
CLOSER TO YOU

07:12.767 --> 07:16.100
NOT THE RIGHT REASON?

07:16.100 --> 07:18.067
- YOU ARE SO FULL OF IT.

07:18.067 --> 07:20.967
BUT I DO WANT TO BE MORE OPEN,
AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE CLOSER.

07:20.967 --> 07:22.267
- WHAT AM I SAYING HERE?

07:22.267 --> 07:23.533
- OKAY, YOU SURE?

07:23.533 --> 07:24.933
- YES.
LET'S DO THIS.

07:24.933 --> 07:26.033
SHOW ME YOUR STUFF.

07:26.033 --> 07:28.133
GOOD.
THIS IS GOOD.

07:28.133 --> 07:29.467
I'M GLAD WE'RE DOING THIS.

07:29.467 --> 07:32.400
THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD
FOR OUR MARRIAGE.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.167
WOW!

07:42.467 --> 07:44.000
WHAT DO YOU GOT IN THERE,

07:44.000 --> 07:47.867
A POEM
OR THE GUY WHO WROTE IT?

07:47.867 --> 07:48.933
- WHAT CAN I SAY?

07:48.933 --> 07:50.933
I'VE INSPIRED SOME WRITING.

07:50.933 --> 07:52.567
OKAY.
GO AHEAD.

07:52.567 --> 07:54.900
- NO. NO, NO.
YOU HEARD MY TAPE.

07:54.900 --> 07:56.333
IT'S YOUR TURN.

07:56.333 --> 07:57.533
GO AHEAD.
LET'S START WITH THE POEM.

07:57.533 --> 07:59.267
- ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

08:03.933 --> 08:05.167
- THAT WAS FAST.

08:05.167 --> 08:07.400
WHAT, DO YOU GOT IT
ALPHABETIZED?

08:07.400 --> 08:09.467
- YOU WANT TO HEAR THE POEM
OR NOT?

08:09.467 --> 08:11.167
- YEAH.

08:11.167 --> 08:13.633
- THIS IS FROM CHAD.
- CHAD.

08:18.567 --> 08:20.100
- DEBRA'S EYES.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.467
"BROWN AS EARTH,

08:21.467 --> 08:24.267
"GIVETH LIFE
TO TREE AND BRUSH.

08:24.267 --> 08:27.167
"SPECKLED GREEN,
LIKE THE BREAST OF A THRUSH.

08:27.167 --> 08:30.000
"YELLOW RINGED
AS THE SUN ON A WEB.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.433
"SO MANY COLORS
IN THINE EYE,

08:32.433 --> 08:33.567
MY DEB."

08:37.633 --> 08:39.233
- OH, MY GOD!

08:39.233 --> 08:41.433
OH, MY GOD!

08:41.433 --> 08:43.567
[laughing]

08:43.567 --> 08:45.333
HOO-HOO!

08:45.333 --> 08:47.100
OH, MAN!

08:47.100 --> 08:48.333
THAT'S THE POEM?

08:48.333 --> 08:49.600
- DON'T MAKE FUN OF IT!

08:49.600 --> 08:51.267
- I DON'T HAVE TO.
READ IT AGAIN.

08:51.267 --> 08:53.733
- IT HAPPENS TO BE
VERY ROMANTIC!

08:53.733 --> 08:55.533
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
READ IT AGAIN.

08:55.533 --> 08:57.733
- NO!
YOU DON'T APPRECIATE IT.

08:57.733 --> 08:58.933
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

08:58.933 --> 09:00.133
HE WROTE THIS
IN THE 10TH GRADE,

09:00.133 --> 09:01.800
AND HE ENDED UP
GOING TO YALE.

09:01.800 --> 09:04.467
- NOT ON A POETRY SCHOLARSHIP.

09:04.467 --> 09:06.600
- WELL, I DON'T SEE YOU
WRITING ME ANY POEMS.

09:06.600 --> 09:11.433
- I CAN'T NOW.
CHAD KILLED POETRY.

09:11.433 --> 09:13.133
SO THAT'S ALL YOU GOT?

09:13.133 --> 09:16.533
SOME RHYMES ABOUT
YOUR MANY-COLORED EYEBALL?

09:16.533 --> 09:19.300
- NO.
THERE ARE LETTERS AND GIFTS.

09:19.300 --> 09:21.000
- GIFTS?
WHAT GIFT?

09:21.000 --> 09:22.700
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
ABOUT ANY GIFTS.

09:22.700 --> 09:23.900
WHAT?
SHOW ME A GIFT.

09:23.900 --> 09:25.067
- THEY'RE NOT IN THE BOX.

09:25.067 --> 09:26.933
- WHERE ARE THEY?

09:26.933 --> 09:27.933
- AROUND.

09:27.933 --> 09:29.100
- AROUND WHERE?

09:29.100 --> 09:30.467
- I DON'T KNOW.

09:30.467 --> 09:33.433
I GOT THAT BIRD FEEDER
OUT IN BACK.

09:33.433 --> 09:35.300
- THAT WAS FROM A BOYFRIEND?

09:35.300 --> 09:36.600
THAT'S A GREAT GIFT.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.233
GUARANTEES THE BIRDS
ARE NICE AND FULL

09:38.233 --> 09:41.567
WHEN THEY FLY OVER MY CAR.

09:41.567 --> 09:44.333
BOY, THAT CHAD'S
A REAL WINNER.

09:44.333 --> 09:46.967
- THAT WASN'T FROM CHAD.
THAT WAS FROM GARY.

09:46.967 --> 09:50.000
- GARY?
OH, ANOTHER GUY.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.967
WHAT'S GARY'S DEAL, HUH?

09:51.967 --> 09:54.133
IS HE A GOOD KISSER?

09:54.133 --> 09:55.367
- OKAY, LISTEN, YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:55.367 --> 09:56.567
I'M SORRY
I BROUGHT THIS UP.

09:56.567 --> 09:58.333
- COME ON,
IS HE A GOOD KISSER?

09:58.333 --> 09:59.733
- I DON'T REMEMBER.

09:59.733 --> 10:00.733
- COME ON.

10:00.733 --> 10:02.033
I JUST WANT TO KNOW

10:02.033 --> 10:03.300
WHEN I'M HOSING OFF
MY WINDSHIELD

10:03.300 --> 10:05.033
THAT THE KISSING WAS GOOD.

10:05.033 --> 10:06.433
- RAY, I REALLY DON'T REMEMBER.

10:06.433 --> 10:08.433
NONE OF THESE GUYS
MEAN ANYTHING TO ME NOW.

10:08.433 --> 10:09.767
- WHAT OTHER GIFTS DO YOU HAVE?

10:09.767 --> 10:10.767
- I DON'T KNOW.

10:10.767 --> 10:12.767
UM, THE PEPPER GRINDER.

10:12.767 --> 10:15.600
- THE PEPPER GRINDER?

10:15.600 --> 10:17.500
OUR PEPPER GRINDER?

10:17.500 --> 10:21.200
THE GRINDER I PEPPER
MY FOOD WITH?

10:24.767 --> 10:27.067
COME--WHAT ELSE?

10:27.067 --> 10:28.900
- ALLY'S DOLL
WITH THE BLUE DRESS.

10:28.900 --> 10:32.100
- SUSANNA?

10:32.100 --> 10:34.833
SOME BOYFRIEND GAVE ALLY
THE SUSANNA DOLL?

10:34.833 --> 10:36.267
- NO, HE GAVE IT TO ME.

10:36.267 --> 10:37.633
- WELL, WHY DID YOU LET HER
PLAY WITH IT?

10:37.633 --> 10:39.067
- SHE SAW IT,
AND SHE WANTED IT.

10:39.067 --> 10:40.433
SHE DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE IT WAS FROM.

10:40.433 --> 10:43.000
- SO SHE JUST SAW
SOME BOYFRIEND DOLL?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.100
WHAT, DID YOU HAVE IT OUT
WHEN YOU WERE READING POETRY

10:45.100 --> 10:47.900
AND FEEDING THE BIRDS

10:47.900 --> 10:50.433
WITH PEPPER?

10:52.067 --> 10:54.233
- YOU KNOW,

10:54.233 --> 10:56.133
MAYBE I DON'T WANT TO BE
CLOSER TO YOU.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.533
- YEAH, WELL, IT'S TOO LATE NOW.

10:57.533 --> 11:00.067
WE'RE CLOSE, MY FRIEND, OKAY?
WHAT ELSE?

11:00.067 --> 11:01.067
- RAY, COME ON.

11:01.067 --> 11:02.300
- NO, NO!
COME ON.

11:02.300 --> 11:04.067
I WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT ALL YOUR OTHER...

11:04.067 --> 11:06.300
LOVER GIFTS.

11:15.333 --> 11:17.467
[clears throat]
GO AHEAD.

11:17.467 --> 11:19.400
- WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA
WRITE THESE DOWN?

11:19.400 --> 11:22.167
- YEAH, FOR INSURANCE PURPOSES.
LET'S GO, KEEP GOING.

11:22.167 --> 11:23.500
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.333
THE LEAKY COOLER
IN THE GARAGE.

11:25.333 --> 11:29.200
- "SUCKY COOLER."

11:29.200 --> 11:30.500
- "LEAKY COOLER."

11:30.500 --> 11:33.333
- YEAH, I GOT MY OWN SYSTEM.
WHAT ELSE?

11:33.333 --> 11:35.700
- THE LAMP WITH THE HORSES.

11:35.700 --> 11:38.033
- "HORSE'S ASS LAMP."

11:40.833 --> 11:41.867
KEEP GOING.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.233
- THERE ARE SOME OTHER THINGS,

11:43.233 --> 11:44.767
BUT I DON'T WANT TO
PLAY THIS ANYMORE.

11:44.767 --> 11:46.167
- WHAT?
WHAT OTHER THINGS?

11:46.167 --> 11:48.000
GOD, THESE THINGS
MUST BE EVERYWHERE, RIGHT?

11:48.000 --> 11:49.333
WHAT ABOUT IN HERE, HUH?

11:49.333 --> 11:52.767
ANYTHING IN OUR BEDROOM
FROM YOUR PAST?

11:55.500 --> 11:56.600
- NO.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.200
- THERE IS.
THERE IS, ISN'T THERE?

11:58.200 --> 12:00.867
WHAT?
WHAT IS IT?

12:00.867 --> 12:03.067
AM I WEARING ANY OF IT?

12:09.167 --> 12:11.633
- THE WHITE PICTURE FRAME.

12:11.633 --> 12:12.700
- [gasps]

12:12.700 --> 12:15.700
THAT'S AROUND A PICTURE
OF OUR CHILDREN!

12:19.267 --> 12:20.733
WAIT A MINUTE.

12:20.733 --> 12:23.267
- THEY'RE OUR KIDS, RAY!

12:26.900 --> 12:29.567
- REALLY?

12:29.567 --> 12:32.067
YOU SURE
THAT THEY WEREN'T A GIFT?

12:32.067 --> 12:33.733
- HONEY, CALM DOWN!

12:33.733 --> 12:34.733
- NO.

12:34.733 --> 12:35.867
- OH, RAY, COME ON.

12:35.867 --> 12:36.867
COME HERE. COME HERE.

12:36.867 --> 12:38.133
- NO, NO, NO.

12:38.133 --> 12:40.400
YOU CAN'T LURE ME
WITH YOUR SEX.

12:42.133 --> 12:44.200
THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT, RIGHT?

12:44.200 --> 12:46.133
I COME OVER THERE,
AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,

12:46.133 --> 12:48.133
I'M IN A CAGE
WITH CHAD AND GARY, GOING,

12:48.133 --> 12:49.300
"I HOPE DEBRA COMES BACK!"

12:49.300 --> 12:50.767
YEAH, WELL,
NO THANK YOU!

12:59.033 --> 13:01.100
- HEY, WHERE YOU BEEN?

13:01.100 --> 13:03.000
WHAT'S ALL THIS STUFF?

13:03.000 --> 13:04.500
- I BOUGHT SOME THINGS.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.667
I THOUGHT IT WAS TIME
TO GET SOME NEW, BETTER THINGS.

13:10.900 --> 13:12.200
- WHAT DID YOU GET?

13:12.200 --> 13:13.633
- WHAT DID I GET?
I GOT SOME GREAT STUFF.

13:13.633 --> 13:16.667
I GOT A COOLER, A LAMP,
A PICTURE FRAME,

13:16.667 --> 13:19.333
AND A PEPPER MILL THAT
HAS BEEN CHEF RECOMMENDED.

13:32.300 --> 13:33.800
SOME NEW, BETTER THINGS.

13:33.800 --> 13:36.067
OH, AND I ALMOST FORGOT.

13:40.033 --> 13:41.500
DEBRA'S EARS.

13:44.767 --> 13:46.333
"ONE ON EACH SIDE,

13:46.333 --> 13:48.500
"LIKE A DAINTY CUP,

13:48.500 --> 13:53.567
"SO GENTLY THEY HOLD
THINE SUNGLASSES UP.

13:53.567 --> 13:56.333
"SO ROUND AND NICE,
WITH A SUBTLE RIDGE,

13:56.333 --> 13:58.133
THERE'S NO BONE IN THERE.

13:58.133 --> 14:00.000
IT'S CARTILAGE."

14:06.900 --> 14:09.467
- OKAY, VERY NICE.

14:09.467 --> 14:11.033
- SO NOW THAT WE HAVE
ALL THESE THINGS,

14:11.033 --> 14:12.700
YOU CAN GET RID
OF ALL YOUR OTHER STUFF.

14:12.700 --> 14:14.300
- RAY.
- WHAT?

14:14.300 --> 14:16.667
IF, AS YOU SAY,
CHAD AND GARY

14:16.667 --> 14:19.233
AND THE OTHER GIVERS OF GIFTS
DON'T MEAN ANYTHING,

14:19.233 --> 14:20.967
THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE
NO REASON TO KEEP THAT STUFF,

14:20.967 --> 14:22.600
SO LET'S JUST TOSS IT OUT.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.800
- DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING
A LITTLE OVERBOARD?

14:24.800 --> 14:26.100
- NO, I DO NOT.

14:26.100 --> 14:27.767
- YOU'RE A COMPLETELY
RATIONAL PERSON?

14:27.767 --> 14:29.367
- YES, I AM.

14:29.367 --> 14:31.767
- HAS ANYONE SEEN SUSANNA?

14:35.800 --> 14:37.900
- YOU DIDN'T!

14:37.900 --> 14:39.633
- DIDN'T WHAT?

14:39.633 --> 14:41.833
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO KNOW
WHERE YOUR DOLL IS, HUH?

14:41.833 --> 14:43.267
MAYBE THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS

14:43.267 --> 14:44.600
WHEN YOU DON'T
TAKE CARE OF YOUR THINGS.

14:44.600 --> 14:47.067
- RAY!

14:47.067 --> 14:48.300
- DID YOU LOOK
UNDER YOUR BED?

14:48.300 --> 14:49.967
- YES.
- AND THE REST OF YOUR ROOM?

14:49.967 --> 14:53.067
- YES.
- AND THE TRUNK OF MY CAR?

14:53.067 --> 14:54.733
- NO.

14:54.733 --> 14:57.133
- WELL, THEN MAYBE BEFORE YOU
COME IN HERE AND START GOING,

14:57.133 --> 14:59.900
"MOMMY, DADDY,
I CAN'T FIND MY THINGS,"

14:59.900 --> 15:02.167
MAYBE YOU SHOULD LOOK THERE.

15:10.267 --> 15:11.500
- WHAT WERE YOU GONNA DO, RAY?

15:11.500 --> 15:13.500
DUMP THE DOLL'S BODY
IN JERSEY?

15:18.367 --> 15:20.367
- I WAS JUST GONNA
TAKE IT FOR A RIDE.

15:22.667 --> 15:23.800
MAYBE...

15:23.800 --> 15:27.733
COME BACK
WITH A BRAND-NEW, BETTER DOLL.

15:27.733 --> 15:29.233
MAYBE A BLACK ONE,

15:29.233 --> 15:31.300
UNLESS MAYBE YOU HAVE
SOME KIND OF PROBLEM WITH THAT.

15:31.300 --> 15:32.700
- OH, YOU ARE
OUT OF YOUR MIND!

15:32.700 --> 15:34.600
- ARE YOU GONNA THROW OUT
THE STUFF OR NOT?

15:34.600 --> 15:35.767
- NO!

15:35.767 --> 15:36.967
- I WOULD DO IT FOR YOU!

15:36.967 --> 15:38.200
- I WOULD NEVER
ASK YOU TO DO THAT.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.700
- YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO.

15:39.700 --> 15:41.467
I'D NEVER PUT YOU
IN A POSITION OF HAVING TO!

15:41.467 --> 15:45.800
HERE, MY ENTIRE PRE-DEBRA
FEMALE HISTORY, GONE!

15:45.800 --> 15:46.800
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:46.800 --> 15:47.800
- I DO IT FOR YOU!

15:47.800 --> 15:50.933
- OH, THIS IS CRAZY!

15:50.933 --> 15:53.133
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT'S IN HERE?

15:53.133 --> 15:54.900
THIS IS JUST THE TAPE
AND A SHOE HORN.

15:54.900 --> 15:56.467
THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE.

15:56.467 --> 15:59.000
WHAT, ARE YOU BLUFFING
SO I'LL THROW OUT MY STUFF?

15:59.000 --> 16:02.367
- I WASN'T BLUFFING.

16:02.367 --> 16:04.000
DEBRA.

16:06.300 --> 16:08.667
THAT'S ALL THERE IS.

16:08.667 --> 16:11.033
- A SHOE HORN?

16:11.033 --> 16:12.567
- IT CAME WITH THE BOX.

16:22.867 --> 16:26.000
- WHAT ABOUT THAT "WHAT A HUNK"
MUG WITH THE HEARTS?

16:27.767 --> 16:29.567
- FROM MY MOM.

16:33.433 --> 16:34.267
- OH.

16:34.267 --> 16:35.667
- DON'T FEEL SORRY FOR ME,

16:35.667 --> 16:37.467
UNLESS YOU'RE
FEELING SORRY FOR ME

16:37.467 --> 16:41.233
BECAUSE I HAVE TO LIVE IN
A MUSEUM OF YOUR EROTIC PAST.

16:41.233 --> 16:43.233
- IT IS NOT A MUSEUM.

16:43.233 --> 16:47.333
- SO YOU ADMIT IT WAS EROTIC!

16:47.333 --> 16:49.067
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S TIME TO CLEAN HOUSE.

16:49.067 --> 16:50.367
- ALL RIGHT.
OKAY, FINE.

16:50.367 --> 16:52.100
YOU--YOU THROW IT ALL OUT
IF YOU WANT.

16:52.100 --> 16:53.433
YOU CAN THROW OUT ALL MY STUFF.

16:53.433 --> 16:54.967
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT STUFF.

16:54.967 --> 16:58.067
BUT IF YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE
GOING TO ERASE MY PAST,

16:58.067 --> 16:59.567
YOU ARE NOT GONNA DO THAT.

16:59.567 --> 17:02.233
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU WOULD WANT TO DO THAT

17:02.233 --> 17:05.400
BECAUSE MY PAST
HAS MADE ME WHO I AM.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.500
- SO I CAN THROW IT ALL OUT?

17:20.233 --> 17:21.333
- YOU KNOW,
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

17:21.333 --> 17:22.700
YOU KNOW
WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS?

17:22.700 --> 17:23.667
THAT TAPE.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.267
- NO, IT'S NOT.
- YES, IT IS.

17:25.267 --> 17:27.000
YOU THINK ALL THESE GIFTS
MEAN AS MUCH TO ME

17:27.000 --> 17:29.100
AS YOUR PRECIOUS TAPE
MEANS TO YOU.

17:29.100 --> 17:30.533
- THE TAPE DOESN'T MEAN
ANYTHING TO ME.

17:30.533 --> 17:32.167
YOU JUST SAW ME
THROW IT IN THE GARBAGE!

17:32.167 --> 17:34.033
- OH, AND I SAW YOUR FACE
WHEN YOU LISTENED TO IT.

17:34.033 --> 17:35.333
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
IT WAS 20 YEARS AGO,

17:35.333 --> 17:37.300
AND WE WERE
BACK IN YOUR DORM ROOM.

17:37.300 --> 17:38.667
- I DIDN'T MAKE ANY FACE.

17:38.667 --> 17:42.733
- YOU TURNED ALL RED
AND EMBARRASSED

17:42.733 --> 17:45.267
LIKE ON OUR FIRST DATE
WHEN YOU ORDERED THE...

17:45.267 --> 17:47.000
"FIL-LET MIG-NON."

17:55.767 --> 17:56.833
- SO?

17:56.833 --> 17:58.200
IT'S A LITTLE EMBARASSING.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.567
- NO, IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

18:00.567 --> 18:02.100
BUT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO
TELL ME

18:02.100 --> 18:05.900
WHY "KAREN 1982"
STILL MEANS SO MUCH TO YOU,

18:05.900 --> 18:07.433
I'M NOT GONNA KEEP ASKING.

18:15.767 --> 18:18.600
- WHY DID SHE BREAK UP WITH ME?

18:18.600 --> 18:20.000
- WHAT?

18:21.300 --> 18:22.933
- THAT'S WHY
I KEPT THE TAPE FOR SO LONG.

18:22.933 --> 18:26.100
I JUST
WANTED TO FIGURE IT OUT.

18:26.100 --> 18:27.800
COULD YOU LISTEN
TO THE TAPE?

18:27.800 --> 18:30.267
MAYBE THERE'S SOME HIDDEN
WOMAN THING I'M NOT HEARING.

18:31.733 --> 18:33.133
- I HEARD THE TAPE.

18:33.133 --> 18:34.700
SHE DOESN'T SAY
WHY SHE BREAKS UP WITH YOU.

18:34.700 --> 18:36.067
- WHY DOESN'T SHE?

18:36.067 --> 18:38.967
- I WASN'T THERE.

18:38.967 --> 18:40.167
WHAT HAPPENED?

18:40.167 --> 18:43.000
- I DON'T KNOW.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.367
THINGS WERE GOING GOOD.

18:44.367 --> 18:47.200
WE HAD BEEN GOING OUT
FOR A COUPLE MONTHS.

18:47.200 --> 18:49.600
IT SEEMED LIKE
SHE WAS HAPPY WITH ME.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.433
THEN I REMEMBER
WE WENT TO SEE TOOTSIE.

18:51.433 --> 18:52.967
I LIKED IT.
SHE LIKED IT.

18:52.967 --> 18:54.800
WE HAD FUN.

18:54.800 --> 18:58.067
NEXT THING I KNOW,
"GOOD-BYE FOREVER, RAY."

18:58.067 --> 19:00.633
WHAT DID I DO?

19:00.633 --> 19:02.700
PEOPLE LIKE TOOTSIE,
RIGHT?

19:04.933 --> 19:06.000
- I LIKED IT.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.200
- SEE?

19:08.200 --> 19:10.633
SO WHAT WAS IT?

19:10.633 --> 19:12.300
IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY
CAN BREAK UP WITH YOU

19:12.300 --> 19:14.133
AT ANY TIME FOR NO REASON.

19:19.433 --> 19:21.700
I JUST ALWAYS
WANTED TO KNOW WHY, YOU KNOW?

19:38.500 --> 19:39.500
- HI, RAY.

19:39.500 --> 19:40.633
THIS IS DEBRA.

19:40.633 --> 19:42.667
UM, I'VE BEEN
DOING SOME THINKING,

19:42.667 --> 19:46.233
AND THESE ARE THE REASONS
WHY WE SHOULD BREAK UP.

19:46.233 --> 19:50.600
YOU'RE OBSESSIVE,
INSECURE, SELFISH.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.333
YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE
THE BEST JUDGMENT

19:52.333 --> 19:56.033
WITH YOUR CHILDREN
AND THEIR DOLLS.

19:56.033 --> 19:57.367
AND YET,

19:57.367 --> 19:59.467
I'M NEVER GONNA
LEAVE YOU EVER,

19:59.467 --> 20:02.200
BECAUSE YOU HAPPEN
TO BE PERFECT FOR ME.

20:02.200 --> 20:06.433
AND I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH,
YOU STUPID, STUPID MAN.

20:14.700 --> 20:16.033
BEEP!

20:22.333 --> 20:24.767
- THAT'S THE BEST MESSAGE
ANYBODY'S EVER LEFT ME.

20:32.567 --> 20:34.767
STILL WANNA LURE ME
WITH YOUR SEX?

20:40.400 --> 20:43.000
- DID YOU EVER LISTEN TO THE
REST OF THAT TAPE FROM COLLEGE?

20:43.000 --> 20:44.533
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

20:44.533 --> 20:47.200
- SOUNDED LIKE THERE WERE
A LOT MORE MESSAGES ON IT.

20:47.200 --> 20:49.067
- NO, I DIDN'T LISTEN.

20:49.067 --> 20:50.400
AFTE THE KAREN MESSAGE,

20:50.400 --> 20:52.400
ALL I COULD LISTEN TO
WAS DAN FOGELBERG.

20:57.900 --> 20:59.367
- YOU READY?
READY FOR THIS?

21:01.600 --> 21:03.300
- HELLO, RAYMOND.

21:03.300 --> 21:06.133
IT'S YOUR MOTHER.

21:06.133 --> 21:08.433
I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU TODAY.

21:08.433 --> 21:11.433
DID YOU ENJOY THE COOKIES
I SENT YOU?

21:11.433 --> 21:12.767
[beeps]

21:12.767 --> 21:15.967
RAYMOND, IT'S YOUR MOTHER.

21:15.967 --> 21:18.067
STILL HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU.

21:18.067 --> 21:19.900
I HOPE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

21:19.900 --> 21:20.900
[beeps]

21:20.900 --> 21:23.267
RAYMOND ALBERT BARONE.

21:23.267 --> 21:24.467
THIS IS YOUR MOTHER.

21:24.467 --> 21:26.633
YOU PICK UP THAT PHONE,
AND YOU CALL ME.

21:26.633 --> 21:27.933
[beeps]

21:27.933 --> 21:29.000
- RAY, IT'S YOUR FATHER.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.567
JEEZALOO, CALL YOUR MOTHER.

21:32.867 --> 21:33.867
[beeps]

21:33.867 --> 21:35.233
- RAY, ROBERT.

21:35.233 --> 21:36.733
I WAS THINKING OF COMING UP
THIS WEEKEND.

21:36.733 --> 21:38.533
- ROBBIE,
ARE YOU TALKING TO RAYMOND?

21:38.533 --> 21:40.700
- I GOT TO GET
OUT OF THIS HOUSE.

21:40.700 --> 21:41.867
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

21:41.867 --> 21:43.100
WHY WOULD YOU GO TO COLLEGE?

21:43.100 --> 21:44.267
YOU GOT TO HELP ME, MAN.

21:44.267 --> 21:45.567
- COME ON, GIVE ME THAT PHONE.

21:45.567 --> 21:46.367
- MA! MA!

21:46.367 --> 21:47.667
GET OUT OF MY ROOM!
