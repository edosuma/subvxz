of the powder river.

37:36.781 --> 37:39.416
Might be better
than going in there.

37:39.517 --> 37:41.318
I can't.

37:41.419 --> 37:43.353
I have to go in.

37:43.421 --> 37:45.922
I got called in
to my own office.

37:52.163 --> 37:54.598
Fales: I was beginning to worry
you weren't coming,

37:54.699 --> 37:57.067
thought maybe
you were going to flee.

37:57.135 --> 37:59.503
Are you here to arrest me?

37:59.604 --> 38:00.604
[ Laughs ]

38:00.705 --> 38:02.873
I'm still thinking about it.

38:05.143 --> 38:07.444
Been wondering something
about you, Detective.

38:07.512 --> 38:08.445
[ Door closes ]

38:08.513 --> 38:10.314
Fales: What's that?

38:10.415 --> 38:14.751
Why are you working so hard
to find Miller Beck's killer...

38:14.852 --> 38:17.054
When your department
could hardly be bothered

38:17.155 --> 38:18.655
to find my wife's killer?

38:18.756 --> 38:22.526
Town I grew up in
was a small town,

38:22.627 --> 38:24.461
like this one.

38:24.529 --> 38:28.065
And our Sheriff
was a lot like you.

38:28.166 --> 38:29.800
You don't know what I'm like.

38:29.901 --> 38:31.301
I do.

38:31.402 --> 38:33.503
You wear the hat and the badge.

38:33.604 --> 38:35.238
Far as you're concerned,

38:35.340 --> 38:38.709
you're the most important person
for miles around.

38:38.810 --> 38:41.578
And you think you can do
whatever you want

38:41.679 --> 38:43.613
without anyone checking on you.

38:43.715 --> 38:46.850
You know, I saw Sheriffs
in the South

38:46.951 --> 38:50.654
who literally
got away with murder.

38:50.755 --> 38:56.326
And I saw that corruption
trickle down to the deputies.

38:56.427 --> 39:00.364
I grew up around
too many badges

39:00.431 --> 39:04.101
who'd arrest a man
they didn't like,

39:04.168 --> 39:07.104
beat a man who
didn't respect them,

39:07.205 --> 39:10.807
kill a man who hurt them.

39:10.908 --> 39:14.177
I got my badge
for a different purpose.

39:14.245 --> 39:17.814
I want to protect people
from guys like you.

39:17.882 --> 39:21.418
So this is about you
settling some old beef,

39:21.519 --> 39:23.439
with me standing in
for some some corrupt Sheriff

39:23.488 --> 39:24.654
from where you grew up?

39:24.722 --> 39:28.458
I have motive
and plenty of evidence.

39:28.526 --> 39:29.793
What would you do?

39:29.894 --> 39:32.662
Not ignore the one detail
about this case

39:32.730 --> 39:33.851
that doesn't make any sense.

39:33.898 --> 39:35.532
And what's that?

39:35.633 --> 39:38.435
My wife's purse.

39:38.536 --> 39:41.204
My wife...

39:41.272 --> 39:44.274
Never carried more
than $50 in her purse.

39:44.375 --> 39:48.345
Your witness said Miller Beck
took $700 off her.

39:48.446 --> 39:51.648
If he didn't get
that $700 from my wife,

39:51.716 --> 39:53.750
where did he get it?

39:53.818 --> 39:56.553
From another purse?

39:56.621 --> 40:00.590
No. I think someone paid
Miller Beck to stab my wife.

40:00.691 --> 40:03.160
And I think
the same person killed him

40:03.261 --> 40:06.363
to shut him up after
I started asking questions.

40:06.464 --> 40:09.533
Who do you think would have
wanted your wife dead?

40:09.634 --> 40:11.568
Someone that didn't like her,

40:11.636 --> 40:13.703
or someone that didn't like me.

40:13.805 --> 40:16.173
I got a few ideas.

40:16.274 --> 40:19.209
That's a very good theory,
Walt,

40:19.277 --> 40:23.613
but I'd rather stick
with my evidence.

40:23.714 --> 40:29.653
We turned up this medicine bag
in your friend Henry's office.

40:29.720 --> 40:32.456
Mathias said his people

40:32.557 --> 40:36.460
often keep special items
in those bags.

40:36.561 --> 40:38.128
I know what a medicine bag is.

40:38.196 --> 40:39.729
Do you know
what was in Henry's?

40:41.299 --> 40:43.500
Teeth.

40:43.568 --> 40:46.303
And they match Miller Beck's
dental records.

40:46.370 --> 40:50.273
I've got the dead man's teeth
from your friend's office

40:50.374 --> 40:54.377
and proof that he was
in Denver last year.

40:54.479 --> 40:56.446
You may be innocent,

40:56.547 --> 41:00.750
but your friend Henry is not.

41:02.920 --> 41:04.354
You arrested Henry?

41:04.455 --> 41:07.090
The tribal police did.

41:07.191 --> 41:09.726
Then I'll have him
extradited to Denver.

41:09.827 --> 41:12.262
But don't you worry.

41:12.363 --> 41:16.299
I'll make sure he gets
his one phone call.
