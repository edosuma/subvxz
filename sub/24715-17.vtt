You’ve had it out for me since day one,
and the hell if I’m gonna take it anymore!

00:06.881 --> 00:09.384
So, when Stan’s uncle calls again,
the chief of personnel,

00:09.509 --> 00:10.885
I’ll just ring him through to you.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.846
You actually think
that means anything to me?

00:13.013 --> 00:15.181
Do yourself a favor, find a new home,

00:15.265 --> 00:17.809

-What did Hatcher’s wife say about him?

00:22.230 --> 00:24.816
He accused her of having an affair,
and she admitted to it.

00:24.899 --> 00:27.485
How soon after she told you this
did she turn up dead?

00:27.569 --> 00:31.990
-Three days.
-I guarantee you Hatcher killed his wife.

The department’s been... (CLEARS THROAT)
...charged with beefing up patrols,

01:05.565 --> 01:08.276
so they haven’t been backfilling
the bureau like they’re supposed to.

01:09.402 --> 01:11.279
-You see where I’m going with this?
-No.

01:11.404 --> 01:12.947
Because of the patrol allocations,

01:13.031 --> 01:15.408
some squads are coming up
short manpower-wise.

01:15.533 --> 01:17.952
So, to equalize it out,
they gotta move some guys around.

01:18.119 --> 01:20.747
-ANDY: Okay.
-And, uh, we got to give up a guy,

01:20.872 --> 01:22.248
and they didn’t give me a choice
as to who,

01:22.332 --> 01:24.667
-so don’t go griping at me.
-Who is it, Eddie?

01:24.751 --> 01:28.004
You, you’re transferred
to missing persons at the morgue.

01:28.630 --> 01:31.049
-I’m transferred?
-The bureau didn’t give me a choice.

01:31.174 --> 01:34.344
So, there’s nothing I can do about it.
So, spare the discussion.

01:34.469 --> 01:35.512
You’re serious?

01:36.221 --> 01:39.557
The day-tour guy at the morgue’s named
Dorland. He’s expecting you.

Don’t make this harder than it’s gotta be.

01:41.518 --> 01:44.479
This come from Chief of Personnel,
Hatcher’s uncle, your buddy?

01:44.646 --> 01:45.730
It came from one PP.

01:45.814 --> 01:48.817
From Hatcher’s uncle
off a call from Hatcher,

01:48.900 --> 01:52.195
-and you know it, and you just folded!
-You dug this grave, not me.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.114
You remember how I said
a time would come

01:54.197 --> 01:55.990

how you got spine?

01:56.241 --> 01:57.700
You could have left well enough alone.

it was legit therapy.

for when me and Stan were partners.

Plus, a list of our informants.

08:00.521 --> 08:04.901
-Did he also keep his own informants?
-Yeah, more unregistered than registered,

08:05.026 --> 08:07.445
but no one gave him any flak about it

08:07.528 --> 08:10.323
because everyone knew
who Stan’s uncle was, number one.

08:10.448 --> 08:13.493
And number two...
he did come up with some good information.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.828
Did they go at him at all
when his wife was killed?

08:15.953 --> 08:18.998
Nah, the department bought the theory
that Stan was the intended target,

08:19.081 --> 08:21.626
so they concentrated on it
being a gang hit.

08:22.043 --> 08:23.920

08:24.462 --> 08:25.755
What you do have going for you

08:25.838 --> 08:27.423
is I don’t think
a lot of Stan’s informants

08:27.507 --> 08:29.800
were ever approached by investigators.

08:29.967 --> 08:32.553

Yes, I know Molly Ziffren.

11:54.672 --> 11:57.007
-When’s the last time you saw her?
-PAULETTE: A month ago.

11:57.174 --> 11:59.260
-GREG: Any hostility between you?
-Why?

11:59.468 --> 12:01.762
Well, Molly’s apartment got ripped off,
and your name pops came up.

12:07.810 --> 12:10.479
Up till a month ago,
I ran a place called The Iron Heel.

12:10.855 --> 12:13.649
Molly was my top girl.
But she got bigheaded about it,

12:13.733 --> 12:16.110
and took off with all of her clients
and most of mine.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.236

-It shut me down.

12:17.319 --> 12:19.739
I’d say it’s a good place
to start a grudge.

12:20.489 --> 12:22.825
I have other ways of working out
my aggressions.

12:23.242 --> 12:25.202
-Theft isn’t one of them.
-Where were you this morning,

12:25.286 --> 12:26.954
-6:00 a.m. on?
-PAULETTE: Here.

12:27.121 --> 12:29.081

’Cause we’re gonna look into you.

12:52.646 --> 12:54.857
-You’re not gonna tell my firm...
-Stop speaking.

12:55.983 --> 12:59.361
What did Molly get stolen
that’s got you so riled up anyway?

12:59.445 --> 13:03.574
Actually, nothing was stolen, Miss Voze.
Molly Ziffren was murdered this morning.

13:03.991 --> 13:05.451
Whoa! I’m outta here.

13:05.659 --> 13:07.578

Look, I’m a criminal defense attorney.

-Old CI?
-If he is, he’s not registered.

13:44.323 --> 13:47.535
Here he got popped for smack possession,
and Hatcher was his first call.

13:47.743 --> 13:49.411
Then over here, he’s named as a witness.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.413
-This on one of the stiffs?
-Something else.

to look for this guy?

13:52.832 --> 13:55.376
Uh, the home number he gave
when he was collared

13:55.459 --> 13:57.837
is a pool hall on Houston near Broadway.

You know, working cases
not related to the stiffs.

-Robbery case?
-ANDY: Homicide.

-With a CI involved?
-Maybe.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.156
(CLEARS THROAT)
Maybe a dirty cop involved.

14:26.574 --> 14:27.867
In a homicide?

14:28.284 --> 14:30.286
-Maybe his wife.
-Get out.

14:30.452 --> 14:32.913
He got me transferred down here
'cause I was looking into it.

14:33.038 --> 14:36.792
(LAUGHING) Okay, now, I know
you’re full of it, or just paranoid.

14:37.084 --> 14:39.044
And if you’re running
your show from down here,

it’s gonna kick up a lot of dust
on both of us.

Dorland, I got nothing to lose.

And if you really spent 16 years
down here in this pit, you don’t either.

-Hey, the morgue’s important work.
-It ain’t nailing a dirty cop.

Nah.

Well, I wouldn’t mind

remember that Detective Hatcher dude...

about you and Hatcher?

16:28.821 --> 16:30.572
back when I was still mixed up
in that gang.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.450
So, off that, he kept trying
to turn me out as his informant,

16:33.534 --> 16:35.244
which, you know, I wasn’t down with him,

16:35.327 --> 16:38.330
but so as not to piss him off,
I gave him some lame info.

when his wife was killed.

it was gang-related? Like he said.

he was investigating.

from a different angle now,

18:01.163 --> 18:02.706
like that Hatcher was behind it.

18:03.665 --> 18:06.418
Yeah, well, that’s an interesting theory.

18:06.627 --> 18:09.046
Look, I know you were in Hatcher’s
hip pocket back then.

18:09.129 --> 18:12.382
So, you are gonna point me in the right
direction, and I’ll leave you alone.

-Hatcher still a cop?
-Yeah.

around this, Mr. Welkos.

19:31.795 --> 19:35.174
-She billed me for a date.
-If you’re a client, what’s so unusual?

19:35.257 --> 19:37.509
-KENNETH: This was a date date.
-BALDWIN: Which means?

19:38.135 --> 19:40.637
I thought we were going to start
seeing each other socially.

19:40.804 --> 19:42.890
-Apparently, I was wrong.
-To the tune of?

19:43.015 --> 19:46.351
She billed me 500 dollars
for services rendered.

19:46.518 --> 19:47.853
And that’s what prompted the emails?

19:47.936 --> 19:49.438
KENNETH: Is she calling them harassment
or something?

19:49.563 --> 19:52.482
Because I quit writing her three days ago.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.527
Where were you this morning
around 6:00 a.m.?

19:55.694 --> 19:58.947
-Walking my dog, the dog park.
-Anyone see you in the dog park?

20:00.032 --> 20:03.827
-All this over some emails?
-Molly Ziffren got assaulted, Mr. Welkos.

-Well, sounds like you had a reason.
-KENNETH: No.

20:09.124 --> 20:11.501
No, no way. I worshipped her.

20:12.127 --> 20:14.296
But when you fell in love,
she wanted to keep it business.

20:14.379 --> 20:17.549
-Now, that’s gotta sting.
-It did. But I got over it.

20:18.508 --> 20:20.761

ask her if I’m capable of violence.

They told me you were NYPD,
I thought you are here about my case.

20:52.668 --> 20:55.796
I'm not. I’m here to ask you
some questions about Stan Hatcher.

20:56.505 --> 20:59.758
-All right, I’ll help you if you help me.
-What are you in for, Emilio?

20:59.841 --> 21:03.303
Insurance fraud and identity theft,
neither nor which I was party to.

But an illegal search of my apartment,
and they find 50 fake IDs,

21:06.974 --> 21:09.017
and letterhead from a fictional doctor.

21:09.559 --> 21:13.397
Okay, that part is true. I’ll admit it,
but I defy anyone to prove

21:13.480 --> 21:15.440
beyond a reasonable doubt
that those were mine.

21:15.565 --> 21:17.067
-I'll tell you what...
-EMILIO: But my legal aid attorney,

21:17.150 --> 21:20.153
he advises me to plead "No contest,"
since I'd only get a couple of months.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.281
I end up with a three-year bit,
and I can’t get

21:22.364 --> 21:23.782
another lawyer to reexamine my case.

21:23.991 --> 21:26.618
I will look into it, you have my word.
But later, not now.

21:26.827 --> 21:31.206
-Now, or I ain’t helping you.
-Later. Or I call my friend in the FBI,

21:31.290 --> 21:33.709
who will turn this over
to the U.S. attorney’s office,

21:33.792 --> 21:36.378
and he’ll add on federal charges.
Do you want that?

21:37.754 --> 21:39.715
-No.
-Stan Hatcher.

21:40.090 --> 21:42.801
Eight years ago,
his wife was killed by a car bomb.

21:42.884 --> 21:45.178
We’re looking into the possibility
that he was involved.

21:45.345 --> 21:46.346
Whoa!

21:47.139 --> 21:48.890
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

21:49.516 --> 21:52.060
I always wondered
if Hatcher was behind that.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.771
-What do you know about it?
-Well, I’ll tell you this,

21:54.855 --> 21:57.482

I see this guy named Frankie Lawrence.

which I may or may not have sold to him.

22:04.740 --> 22:08.827
But to pay for it, he pulled out
this wad of cash that would choke a hippo.

22:08.910 --> 22:11.580
This is a guy who never had
more than 20 bucks in his pocket.

22:11.705 --> 22:13.332
-You ask him where he got it?
-Yeah.

22:13.415 --> 22:15.417
He just smile and say
Hatcher been good to him.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.336
On the gate!

22:17.461 --> 22:19.212
Wait, wait, wait. You’re gonna look
into this for me, aren’t you?

22:19.296 --> 22:21.381
I will take care of you
one way or the other. All right?

22:21.465 --> 22:24.801

working in the library, something!

22:37.773 --> 22:39.524
-ANDY: Excuse me, ma’am?
-Yes.

22:39.608 --> 22:42.235
I’m Detective Sipowicz,
looking for Frankie Lawrence.

22:42.444 --> 22:43.528
Are you his mother?

22:44.863 --> 22:46.782
-Yes.
-I’m not trying to get Frankie in trouble.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.492
I just need to talk to him
for a few minutes.

22:48.575 --> 22:51.036
-Do you know where he is?
-Not trying to get him in trouble, huh?

22:51.203 --> 22:53.622
-That’s right.
-Because all you cops care about him

22:53.705 --> 22:56.333
so much, right?
I mean, you’re his best friend.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.585
You’d never screw him over.

22:59.252 --> 23:02.547
-He’s got your word, right?
-I need to talk to your son.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.633
He’s dead, you son of a bitch.

23:05.592 --> 23:08.595
He’s in a place
where you can’t harass him anymore.

23:08.970 --> 23:11.723
-How did he die?
-(SCOFFS) What do you care?

23:12.349 --> 23:14.851
Ma'am, I’m investigating a cop
who may have been one of the guys

23:14.935 --> 23:16.395
who was harassing your son.

23:17.854 --> 23:19.898
-He died three months ago.
-How?

23:20.357 --> 23:21.400
The drugs.

23:21.566 --> 23:24.027
I know this is a very difficult time
for you.

23:24.194 --> 23:27.739
But did Frankie ever mention
a cop named Stan Hatcher?

23:28.073 --> 23:31.701
-(SOBS) No!
-It’s really important that we try to...

23:33.078 --> 23:34.121
(LOCK CLICKING)

23:44.131 --> 23:47.217
Pardon me, boss,
but I just don’t understand the logic

23:47.342 --> 23:50.595
of sending a first-grade detective
to work in the morgue.

23:50.679 --> 23:52.097
They didn’t give me a choice, Medavoy.

23:52.180 --> 23:54.808
-It’s a dumping ground for dead wood.
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

23:54.933 --> 23:56.560
Were you guys not working a case?

23:56.643 --> 23:58.728
Yeah, there’s no record or warrant
for Paulette Voze,

23:58.812 --> 24:03.733
the dominatrix our DOA used to work for,
or for her lawyer, slave Bernard Westley.

24:03.900 --> 24:06.736
How about this Yahoo Welkos,
the one walking his dog?

24:06.820 --> 24:09.448
We’re still running the names he gave us.
All answering machines.

24:09.614 --> 24:12.451
GREG: At most, a guy can tolerate
six months in the morgue

24:12.617 --> 24:15.078
before the formaldehyde stink
rots your brain out.

24:15.203 --> 24:17.122
Ortiz, any progress?

24:17.205 --> 24:19.708
(CLEARS THROAT) Welkos got a ticket
for alternate side

24:19.791 --> 24:22.794
a block away from the DOA's
apartment building early this morning.

24:22.878 --> 24:25.005
-Where’s Welkos now?
-We let him go to work.

24:25.088 --> 24:26.590
Yeah, we’ll get him back in.

24:28.425 --> 24:31.720
Uh, boss, I got an interview
on that gas-station robbery last week.

24:31.845 --> 24:32.929
Take a radio.

24:35.265 --> 24:37.684
Clark? Two seconds.

24:44.191 --> 24:46.359
I just got a call
from an old informant of mine.

24:46.443 --> 24:49.029
He told me Sipowicz came by
his work asking about me,

24:49.112 --> 24:52.157
asking about the circumstances
under which my wife was killed.

24:52.532 --> 24:54.493
-You know about this?
-First I’ve heard.

24:54.576 --> 24:56.745
It’s bad enough
he’s stepping on my wife’s memory,

24:56.828 --> 25:00.874
but to try and implicate me?
I’ve never been so pissed in my life!

25:00.957 --> 25:03.418
You know, he’s lashing out a little
'cause he thinks you got him transferred.

25:03.585 --> 25:05.921
I did get him transferred.
You tell him that.

25:06.129 --> 25:08.715
-I’ll pass it along.
-And you also tell him that if he thinks

25:08.798 --> 25:11.718
working late tours at the morgue
is as low as he can go on this job,

25:11.801 --> 25:12.969
he’s got another thing coming.

25:13.136 --> 25:15.764
Hey, Stan, relax. In a couple of days,
he’ll get used to working there.

25:15.847 --> 25:19.059
-Everything will be fine.
-He stops with those rumors today.

25:19.351 --> 25:21.478
-You tell him that.
-All right.

25:26.107 --> 25:27.317
I need to know right now,

you talked to must have dropped the dime.

-Hatcher get in your face?
-Yeah. To confirm my loyalty to him.

25:56.930 --> 25:58.598

You got him good and scared,
but he’s throwing out a lot of threats.

ANDY: Threats towards me don't matter.

26:04.271 --> 26:05.855
But if he gets close to you,
you’re backing off of this.

Hell, no!

There’s plenty of open desks down here,

-Appreciate it.

to have a telephone conversation?

-Did you get something?
-Yeah. Well, I’ve been clawing

26:18.201 --> 26:20.579
through background on your OD,
Frankie Lawrence.

26:20.745 --> 26:24.666
Turns out, he contacted a total
of eight different people on 17 arrests.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.711
So, I ran those names past
a buddy of mine at the FBI.

26:27.794 --> 26:30.171
Turns out, that one of the guys
Lawrence called

26:30.255 --> 26:33.091
-has military experience.
-As what?

26:33.550 --> 26:37.304

He cleared land mines.

-Bomb guy.
-WALLY: Yeah.

about Frankie Lawrence.

(DOOR CLOSING)

27:05.332 --> 27:07.042
-Okay.
-You were friends, right?

27:07.250 --> 27:09.669
Were, yeah, but not for like,
three, four years.

27:09.794 --> 27:11.212
What? You two have a falling out?

27:11.338 --> 27:12.547
-Yeah.
-Over?

27:13.173 --> 27:14.841
JERRY: He made a move on a girl of mine.

27:14.966 --> 27:17.135
Told her a bunch of bad things about me
just to make himself look good

27:17.218 --> 27:20.472
so he could get into her pants.
That was it. I haven’t seen him since.

27:20.555 --> 27:22.307
But eight years ago, you two were tight?

27:22.515 --> 27:23.850
-That’s right.
-ANDY: That was back

27:23.933 --> 27:25.393
when Frankie was working with a cop

27:25.477 --> 27:27.604
-named Stan Hatcher.
-Yeah.

27:27.812 --> 27:30.440
Back when Hatcher’s wife
was killed with a car bomb.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.152
What are you guys doing here again?

27:34.235 --> 27:36.571
Looking to find out
maybe if Frankie helped with that bomb.

27:36.863 --> 27:39.324
(HESITATES) That’s something
you should be asking Frankie.

27:39.407 --> 27:41.910
-Don't you think?
-We would if he was still alive.

27:42.243 --> 27:44.120
Frankie OD’d three months ago.

27:45.830 --> 27:47.957
JOHN: So, all this time, the cops
have been investigating that car bomb

27:48.041 --> 27:50.543
as a retaliation from one of the gangs
Hatcher was leaning on.

27:50.627 --> 27:52.962
But now, that we know
that Hatcher and his wife

27:53.046 --> 27:55.006
were having problems,
we’re looking at it different.

27:55.131 --> 27:58.343
Which is why your military background
got red-flagged, Jerry.

27:58.468 --> 28:01.346
In particular,
your training in explosives.

28:01.888 --> 28:03.848
I want confirmation that Frankie’s dead.

28:03.973 --> 28:07.727
(CLEARS THROAT) Call his mom,
Carla Lawrence, Staten Island.

28:07.811 --> 28:08.978
She’s listed. Go ahead.

28:09.979 --> 28:13.191
Now’s the time, Jerry. Frankie’s gone.
You’re not gonna be jamming him up.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.526
And do you really want to sit back

28:14.651 --> 28:17.237
knowing that a cop got away
with killing his wife?

28:17.362 --> 28:18.905
Admitting to something like,

28:18.988 --> 28:23.368
“Oh, I don’t know, that I built a bomb
for Frankie Lawrence eight years ago..."

28:24.452 --> 28:27.080
that wouldn’t exactly be good
for me career-wise,

28:27.497 --> 28:31.292
especially now that I’m trying
to get back visitation with my son.

28:31.710 --> 28:35.004
If this was a regular investigation,
there’s not much I could promise you.

28:35.296 --> 28:38.258
But I’m in a jackpot here
because of Stan Hatcher.

28:38.341 --> 28:39.884
My career is on the line.

28:40.343 --> 28:44.723
So, you believe me when I tell you
I will help you get your visitation back,

28:44.806 --> 28:48.685
and you will not do a day
for making that bomb eight years ago.

28:51.771 --> 28:54.816
-I knew this would go down one day.
-Will you help me?

28:56.067 --> 28:58.194
Yeah. What the hell?

-How do you know Frankie Lawrence?
-We were friends, roommates for a while.

29:07.912 --> 29:10.999
-Did the name Stan Hatcher ever come up?
-Yeah.

29:11.249 --> 29:14.961
Frankie told me he basically
worked for Hatcher as like an informant.

29:15.086 --> 29:18.298
Did Frankie come to you
with a request for an explosives device?

29:18.465 --> 29:20.008
Yeah, a car bomb.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.635
-Did you make it for him?
-Yeah.

29:23.344 --> 29:26.431
A plastic explosive that was set up
to be rigged to the starter.

29:26.514 --> 29:29.434
-Which you knew how to put together how?
-From my military training.

29:29.642 --> 29:32.520
Did Frankie ever say
what the bomb was for?

29:32.937 --> 29:33.938
No.

29:34.022 --> 29:36.316
Did he ever tell you that it was used
on Stan Hatcher’s wife?

29:36.524 --> 29:40.236
No, but it was, you know, kind of obvious.
Every time it came on the news,

29:40.403 --> 29:42.405
he’d change the channel
and just give me this look.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.324
Did you install the car bomb?

29:44.783 --> 29:46.618
-No.
-Did you drop Frankie off

29:46.701 --> 29:48.411
-and see him install it?
-No.

29:48.745 --> 29:50.830
So, you’re not positive
what it was used for.

29:51.080 --> 29:52.248

that Hatcher’s wife wanted
out of the marriage.

-Did you not hear this guy in there?

30:06.763 --> 30:09.349
Hatcher is responsible
for his wife getting blown up.

30:09.599 --> 30:12.185
There’s no physical evidence connecting
that bomb to Hatcher.

30:12.268 --> 30:14.729
This doesn’t qualify as enough
for a circumstantial case?

30:14.896 --> 30:17.899
There’s no direct admissions.
There’s not even hearsay evidence.

30:17.982 --> 30:20.318
I couldn’t prove this case
against an organized crime figure,

-let alone a detective.
-You can’t do anything with this?

of Hatcher’s wife?

-Can they collaborate?
-They couldn’t help.

30:26.241 --> 30:28.034
We can't bring charges
if we can’t prove it.

30:28.159 --> 30:30.829

and present it to a grand jury.

32:06.299 --> 32:09.093
they realize the value of the family

-All right, what?

32:52.261 --> 32:53.680
I killed Molly Ziffren.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.182
What happened?

32:56.766 --> 32:59.268
I went over there, told her I loved her.

33:00.228 --> 33:02.188
She started calling me the names.

33:03.106 --> 33:06.317
I said, this wasn’t a session.
"Talk to me like a human being."

33:06.985 --> 33:08.653
(SCOFFS) She slapped me.

33:09.445 --> 33:13.199
Then she went for her canes,
so, I defended myself.

33:14.367 --> 33:15.952
And how’d you kill her?

33:17.203 --> 33:18.496
I really don’t remember.

33:19.288 --> 33:20.289
I blacked out.

33:23.292 --> 33:26.129

something terrible.

33:27.880 --> 33:29.215

The only reason
we’re having this conversation with you

34:14.886 --> 34:17.055
is out of courtesy to Gibson.

34:17.180 --> 34:18.473
You’re pushing your luck, pal.

34:18.556 --> 34:21.893
We have a five o'clock appointment
at the district attorney’s office,

34:21.976 --> 34:25.021
at which point , we’re gonna present
our evidence against you.

34:25.980 --> 34:29.233
-We? You with him on this?
-You’re pretty quick there, Stan.

34:29.734 --> 34:33.571
Who made that car bomb?
Who planted it in your car?

to having an affair before she died?

See, we can prove you arranged
your wife’s murder.

But like I said, I owe Gibson,
and apparently, he owes your uncle.

34:48.544 --> 34:51.923

don’t think you deserve.

35:09.273 --> 35:13.111
You hired your snitch, Frankie Lawrence,
to get the car bomb tor you.

35:13.402 --> 35:15.863

35:15.988 --> 35:18.074

-(DOOR CLOSING)
-No.

36:11.544 --> 36:14.338
She’s a dominatrix
who was killed this morning.

36:14.422 --> 36:17.717
-Oh, I’m sorry to hear that.
-Your husband was seeing her.

36:18.301 --> 36:21.179
Were you aware that your husband
was involved with a dominatrix?

36:21.304 --> 36:22.597
I suppose I was.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.183
-You and your husband are separated.
-(CHAIR SCRAPING)

36:25.349 --> 36:27.268
Yes. He lives in the city.

36:27.685 --> 36:32.857
You see, the problem is... a 2002 Explorer
that’s registered to you and your husband

36:33.065 --> 36:35.151
was ticketed this morning
near Miss Ziffren’s apartment

36:35.276 --> 36:36.485
around the time of her murder.

36:36.903 --> 36:40.364
And we just got the results
of the Explorer’s E-ZPass usage,

36:40.448 --> 36:43.701
and it shows that the car was back
and forth to Connecticut this morning.

36:44.785 --> 36:46.704
That would indicate that you drove, ma’am.

36:46.871 --> 36:48.497
BALDWIN: Did you go
to Miss Ziffren’s apartment this morning?

36:49.248 --> 36:50.416
Was there an argument?

36:52.084 --> 36:55.963
I was there.
We had a conversation about my husband.

36:56.130 --> 36:58.424
But when I left,
she was alive and unharmed.

36:58.674 --> 37:01.761
-And what prompted the visit?
-LEANNE: This had gone on long enough,

37:02.094 --> 37:04.388
and I felt it was time for her
to leave Kenneth alone,

37:04.722 --> 37:06.349
to release him or take the spell off,

37:06.474 --> 37:08.893
or whatever it was she was doing
to just stop.

37:08.976 --> 37:12.605
-What do you mean the spell on him?
-LEANNE: I don’t know what to call it.

37:12.813 --> 37:14.607
But she had to be controlling him somehow.

37:14.690 --> 37:17.026
You don’t just go
from being a normal person,

37:17.109 --> 37:19.946
with a good job,
who loves his wife and children,

37:20.571 --> 37:23.199
to being kept in a cage and whipped.

37:25.117 --> 37:27.578
It’s just not possible.

37:28.412 --> 37:31.415
So, you went over to talk,
and it turned violent. Isn’t that right?

37:32.458 --> 37:34.210
No, I don’t know who killed her.

37:35.336 --> 37:37.421
Well, at this point, neither do we.

37:37.964 --> 37:39.799
But your husband confessed it was him.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.885
So, either both of you were involved,

37:43.052 --> 37:45.096
or your husband figured out
what happened

37:45.388 --> 37:47.348
and copped to it to protect you.

37:47.515 --> 37:51.060
Ma'am, your husband moving out
and assuming this lifestyle

37:51.143 --> 37:52.687
must have been a lot to deal with.

37:52.853 --> 37:55.273
And maybe whatever
Miss Ziffren said to you in that apartment

37:55.356 --> 37:58.067
pushed you over the edge,
but we need to know what happened,

37:58.192 --> 38:02.029
or your husband’s going to spend
the rest of his life in jail for it.

38:04.490 --> 38:09.036
She said I needed to see a shrink,
that I was the one who was screwed up.

38:09.870 --> 38:13.124
I asked her again nicely
to please let my husband go,

38:13.207 --> 38:17.044
-but she just started laughing!
-Is that when you hit her with the statue?

38:17.920 --> 38:20.214
Kenneth called last night
saying he wanted a divorce.

38:20.423 --> 38:23.259
This had to stop.
Someone had to stop her.

38:23.551 --> 38:26.679

in Miss Ziffren’s apartment this morning?

have him come off his story.
