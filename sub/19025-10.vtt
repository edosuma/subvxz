00:03.640 --> 00:07.110
<i>At Sacred Heart, there are certain</i>
<i>things you can always count on.</i>

00:07.200 --> 00:09.919
<i>Dr Kelso will systematically</i>
<i>break Ted's spirit.</i>

00:10.000 --> 00:12.912
Ted, I meant to tell you
eight months ago,

00:13.000 --> 00:18.632
all those days of vacation
you saved up expire right...

00:19.560 --> 00:20.549
Now.

00:20.640 --> 00:26.829
I was going to visit the Alamo with the
guys from my public... speaking class.

00:28.880 --> 00:31.553
<i>Turk will start a fight</i>
<i>with Carla that he'll lose.</i>

00:31.640 --> 00:34.757
This wedding is about us.
How come I can't be comfortable?

00:34.840 --> 00:37.798
How many times must I tell you
you're not wearing sweats?

00:37.880 --> 00:40.314
I don't have to wear sweats.
I'll wear slacks.

00:40.400 --> 00:43.790
I'm also wearing a cape and
I'll stand on the altar like...

00:43.880 --> 00:46.030
<i>I do!</i>

00:46.120 --> 00:48.793
I'm marrying this.
This is gonna be my husband.

00:49.520 --> 00:52.751
<i>Sean and Elliot will t</i> ry
<i>to keep their relationship going.</i>

00:52.840 --> 00:56.037
I love these new camera phones
you got us.

00:56.120 --> 00:57.473
Really?

01:01.200 --> 01:04.158
Did you get it? No?

01:08.280 --> 01:11.033
<i>And the Janitor will think</i>
<i>of new ways to torture me.</i>

01:11.120 --> 01:14.590
Hey... Don't open your locker
for the next couple of days.

01:14.680 --> 01:16.033
Why?

01:23.120 --> 01:26.430
<i>To break the pattern,</i>
<i>you need something shocking to happen.</i>

01:26.520 --> 01:29.273
<i>Like, say, Dr Cox</i>
<i>being in a good mood.</i>

01:29.360 --> 01:33.717
You know, pal, after three long years of
watching you climb that transplant list,

01:33.800 --> 01:35.995
I finally have a liver
with your name on it.

01:36.080 --> 01:39.709
Check Mr Iverson into Sacred Heart
for the last time, will ya?

01:39.800 --> 01:43.349
<i>When Dr Cox is in a good mood,</i>
<i>it flows out of him</i>

01:43.440 --> 01:47.149
<i>like a cool breeze that lifts</i>
<i>the spirits of eve</i> ry <i>one it touches.</i>

01:47.240 --> 01:50.789
Oh, it's going to be a great day.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074

02:19.440 --> 02:21.158
Frick!

02:40.680 --> 02:43.752
Not today. Life's too good.

02:48.480 --> 02:50.277
Chicken.

03:04.160 --> 03:07.072
Come on, Turk,
I got two minutes left on my break.

03:07.160 --> 03:10.470
- How long is this surgery gonna take?
- Cut the guy some slack.

03:10.560 --> 03:13.438
Surgery is not as easy as it looks.

03:13.520 --> 03:16.990
He's gotta make the incision,
cut the wrong artery, panic,

03:17.080 --> 03:19.275
collapse in a ball of tears
in the corner.

03:19.360 --> 03:22.033
After that, he's gotta wash up,
check the board

03:22.120 --> 03:25.556
and find out who he'll be killing
after lunch. It's a grind.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.676
You're always taking shots at Turk,

03:27.760 --> 03:30.274
but you've never told me
what you think of him.

03:33.120 --> 03:36.032
There's the right pitch.
I think that...

03:36.120 --> 03:38.714
Hold that thought.

03:39.760 --> 03:42.957
I would love to hear
what you have to say.

03:43.040 --> 03:44.792
I don't think so, bowling ball.

03:44.880 --> 03:47.030
Spill it. Carla tells me everything.

03:47.120 --> 03:50.351
Except about that curling iron
you have in your locker.

03:50.440 --> 03:51.998
It slipped.

03:55.080 --> 03:58.868
It's back. Look, if it makes it easier,
you can just pretend I'm Carla.

03:58.960 --> 04:01.315
I can totally do this.

04:01.400 --> 04:02.879
- Carla...
- What?

04:02.960 --> 04:06.919
I think your fiancÃ© is a self-involved,
bobble-headed jock-itch

04:07.000 --> 04:10.788
who is not good enough for you.
Not now, not ever.

04:14.080 --> 04:18.072
If your wedding is in Spanish, how
will I know you're officially married?

04:18.160 --> 04:21.435
My cousins will throw tortillas
in the air and fire their guns.

04:21.519 --> 04:23.192
Really?

04:23.280 --> 04:26.033
Oh, God, I wish I was ethnic.

04:26.120 --> 04:29.157
<i>It's always hard to work</i>
<i>with terminally ill patients.</i>

04:29.240 --> 04:31.196
Ted's helping Maggie with her will.

04:31.280 --> 04:35.273
Thanks again, Ted. How'd you get through
<i>6</i> 0 pages so quickly?

04:35.360 --> 04:38.670
Miss Himsel, it helps to
not really know what you're doing.

04:38.760 --> 04:41.558
Stop it, Ted. You're a great lawyer.

04:43.120 --> 04:44.519
I love her.

04:44.600 --> 04:48.070
Maggie, you seem so
at peace with everything.

04:48.160 --> 04:53.996
There's only one thing I'll regret.
I'm 38 years old and I'm a virgin.

04:54.080 --> 04:55.354
- Me too.
- Elliot.

04:55.440 --> 04:58.512
Sorry. It's from playing
in a Christian rock band,

04:58.600 --> 05:01.672
which was bull,
because everyone slept with everyone.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.910
- Sorry.
- That's OK.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.116
I was waiting
for someone special.

05:06.200 --> 05:10.239
Now I feel like I've missed out on one
of the fundamental experiences of life

05:10.320 --> 05:12.151
for no good reason.

05:12.240 --> 05:14.276
Is there anything we can do?

05:14.360 --> 05:16.920
Don't people sometimes pay for sex?

05:17.000 --> 05:21.073
Oh, boy, do they! I slept with Jenny
Johnson's brother in high school.

05:21.160 --> 05:24.072
He told all his friends
what my orgasm face looked like.

05:24.960 --> 05:28.748
Three of them posed like that for their
yearbook photos. I paid for that.

05:28.840 --> 05:30.990
Elliot, she means pay money for sex.

05:31.080 --> 05:37.189
I got a story about that too. Not about
me. My mom. She gets Ionely.

05:45.600 --> 05:48.876
Isn't it great being so comfortable,
you don't have to talk?

05:51.720 --> 05:54.393
Anyway, the point is,
silence is awesome.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.391
Sorry, I'm a little preoccupied.

05:56.480 --> 06:01.076
I walked in on my sister and Perry
this morning. Can you imagine?

06:05.480 --> 06:08.358
Relax, Newbie, the gimp is chained up.

06:08.440 --> 06:11.000
- Careful, though, Randall got loose.
- Who?

06:16.680 --> 06:17.749
Why?

06:17.840 --> 06:20.798
Powerful tiny fists.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.838
I gotta get out of there.
Could I crash at your house?

06:23.920 --> 06:26.195
Sure. Just bring your own toilet paper.

06:26.280 --> 06:29.511
It's kind of a little rule
we have with our guests.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.477
Preferably something two-ply.

06:31.560 --> 06:34.552
- How's it going?
- I'm crashing at your place tonight.

06:34.640 --> 06:37.279
- Cool. Bring toilet paper.
- I already told her.

06:37.360 --> 06:40.670
- How'd you get Dr Cox to like you?
- Dr Cox said he liked me?

06:40.760 --> 06:42.876
- You missed the point.
- Three things.

06:42.960 --> 06:45.997
Where was he, what inflection
did he use, was he drinking?

06:46.080 --> 06:48.674
I don't care.
Drinking makes you truthful.

06:48.760 --> 06:51.399
Carla's gonna have a
pre-wedding panic attack.

06:51.480 --> 06:55.393
What if she has her buddy Dr Cox there
to tell her what a jackass I am?

06:55.480 --> 06:57.072
Then what?

06:57.160 --> 07:01.153
You know what?
I'm glad he was drunk.

07:01.240 --> 07:02.593
Thank you.

07:08.080 --> 07:11.516
- How was the liquor store, big guy?
- What are you talking about?

07:11.600 --> 07:13.909
Your six pack. Much love.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.516
I don't know what you're talking about,

07:19.600 --> 07:22.319
if you're sucking up to me
or making a pass at me,

07:22.400 --> 07:25.756
but I say skip it and we continue
in our state of mutual disdain.

07:25.840 --> 07:29.276
Dr Cox, you got it all wrong, man.

07:29.360 --> 07:33.911
I don't disdain you.
It's quite the opposite. I "dain" you.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.356
If you get to know me better,
you just might dain me too.

07:37.440 --> 07:41.228
That's interesting. It's gibberish,
but it's interesting.

07:41.320 --> 07:44.198
I'm gonna go ahead and pass
and here's why:

07:44.280 --> 07:48.398
You're a typical surgeon. As a rule you
guys are insensitive and egotistical,

07:48.480 --> 07:51.074
and you have the humour
of a fourth grader.

07:51.160 --> 07:52.354
That's just not true.

07:52.440 --> 07:55.159
Who wants to touch my giant balls?

08:01.640 --> 08:03.392
Damn.

08:05.440 --> 08:07.874
Your kidney's healed
enough to release you,

08:07.960 --> 08:10.428
but no sparring in karate class
for two months.

08:10.520 --> 08:12.954
Two months?
That's a real punch in the crotch.

08:13.040 --> 08:16.919
Could you stop using that expression?
I can't get it out of my head.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.788
Ladies, explain to me
why you are so concerned

08:20.880 --> 08:23.269
with my policy on patients having sex?

08:23.360 --> 08:26.318
- No reason. Trying to learn.
- Just curious. I love you.

08:26.400 --> 08:29.437
Well, why not make it the same
as my sex policy with my wife:

08:29.520 --> 08:32.114
Absolutely not. Now make me a sandwich.

08:35.919 --> 08:38.798
- So, you and Jordan had a kid.
- Parenthood's amazing.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.950
You're all set.

08:41.039 --> 08:45.033
Some peon from surgery's gonna
do your pre-op then you're good to go.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.839
Room service. Who ordered the liver?

08:47.920 --> 08:49.638
- Jackass.
- Bite me.

08:49.720 --> 08:51.790
Great guy.

08:53.480 --> 08:57.109
Laverne, my girlfriend's coming.
Would you mind giving her my keys?

08:57.200 --> 09:02.194
I shacked up with a man before I was
married, too. His name was Jesus.

09:02.280 --> 09:05.238
Our generation has the same morals
and values as yours.

09:05.320 --> 09:07.515
Come on, let's find a man-whore.

09:07.600 --> 09:08.589
See ya.

09:08.680 --> 09:13.470
She's not moving in permanently.
She's just crashing for a while.

09:13.560 --> 09:17.235
About a year ago, Jordan said
she wanted to crash for a while.

09:17.320 --> 09:20.551
Now my office is a nursery,
my closet is my office,

09:20.640 --> 09:24.030
my clothes are in the entertainment
centre, my TV is in the john,

09:24.120 --> 09:27.590
which I guess is kind of nice,
I don't even know any more.

09:27.680 --> 09:29.113
Same thing happened to me.

09:29.200 --> 09:33.716
After my divorce, I told Marianna
I'd crash at her place a few weeks.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.995
We've been sharing a bed
for eight years.

09:36.080 --> 09:40.551
- Isn't Marianna your mother?
- Who are we talking about, you or me?

09:40.640 --> 09:44.030
Here's the rule. The moment
her toothbrush hits your sink,

09:44.120 --> 09:46.429
you've got yourself a permanent roomie.

09:49.240 --> 09:50.753
How long will you be staying?

09:50.840 --> 09:52.353
For a while.

09:54.680 --> 09:57.558
Downy soft.

10:01.280 --> 10:04.158
There'll be toilet paper everywhere.

10:04.520 --> 10:05.748
Gotta go.

10:05.840 --> 10:10.277
Hey, real sorry about
the whole mom situation, there.

10:10.360 --> 10:14.194
- She has cold toes.
- Ted, don't be that guy.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.032
What guy?

10:17.400 --> 10:19.038
What guy?

10:19.120 --> 10:22.669
This is so exciting. The closest
I've ever come to breaking the law

10:22.760 --> 10:25.593
was when Alex Peterson
sold his mom's Virginia Slims.

10:25.680 --> 10:28.433
- Was he a Blood or a Crip?
- He was Lutheran.

10:28.520 --> 10:33.719
This is it. Stop the car. Keep the
meter running. We'll be right back.

10:35.880 --> 10:38.474
What a rush!
I've never slept with a prostitute

10:38.560 --> 10:41.916
but if it is half as much fun
as buying one, sign me up.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.072
Quiet down back there.

10:45.160 --> 10:46.559
Sorry.

10:47.920 --> 10:52.630
Though I won't perform the transplant,
I am a key member of the team.

10:52.720 --> 10:55.280
It's too complicated
to explain what it is I do,

10:55.360 --> 10:59.478
but in layman's terms,
I guess you'd call it watching.

10:59.560 --> 11:02.074
- Could you excuse me one second?
- Sure.

11:06.360 --> 11:09.750
I taught him that.
Well struck, Barry.

11:11.160 --> 11:14.391
Let's finish up here, OK?
Have you been smoking?

11:14.480 --> 11:16.516
- No, sir.
- Drinking?

11:16.600 --> 11:20.752
No. Oh, I had a couple of glasses of
champagne at my daughter's wedding.

11:20.840 --> 11:23.115
But a little champagne's
no big deal, huh?

11:23.200 --> 11:24.713
Nah.

11:31.240 --> 11:34.994
Look, Barry's a great guy.

11:35.080 --> 11:38.959
I totally forgot the rule to the
transplant list is no drinking,

11:39.040 --> 11:40.951
unless Cox says you're a great guy.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.952
Come on, the guy's been
on the list for three years.

11:44.040 --> 11:47.953
- This is a no-brainer.
- You're right.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.632
He's out.

12:03.400 --> 12:07.234
This is why you shouldn't get
emotionally invested in your patients.

12:07.320 --> 12:11.552
Hey, Bob-O, now when the dark prince
does finally call you home,

12:11.640 --> 12:14.791
please promise me that
you'll donate your body to science.

12:14.880 --> 12:18.555
I don't mean medical science,
I mean NASA.

12:18.640 --> 12:21.108
Because when those buzz-cuts
have given up

12:21.200 --> 12:23.714
on figuring out
exactly what a black hole is,

12:23.800 --> 12:27.270
and get one look at that space
where your heart was supposed to be,

12:27.360 --> 12:32.195
well, they're just gonna say:
"Aw, shucks. That's what it is."

12:32.280 --> 12:36.751
Hey, champ, what has two thumbs
and doesn't give a crap?

12:36.840 --> 12:39.195
Bob Kelso. How ya doing?

12:45.160 --> 12:47.628
<i>You're gonna have to tell her</i>
<i>she can't move in.</i>

12:47.720 --> 12:50.393
<i>It's no big deal.</i>
<i>It's not like she has the keys yet.</i>

12:55.840 --> 12:58.195
<i>God, I'm horrible at giving bad news.</i>

12:58.280 --> 13:00.840
<i>Wait, I'm a doctor.</i>
<i>I give bad news all the time.</i>

13:00.920 --> 13:03.309
<i>Just like I did with Mr Clark</i>
<i>this morning.</i>

13:03.400 --> 13:05.675
<i>Who does his daughter</i>
<i>always remind me of?</i>

13:05.760 --> 13:07.159
<i>Molly Ringwald.</i>

13:07.240 --> 13:10.437
<i>She was good in</i> The Breakfast Club.
<i>I should rent that again.</i>

13:10.520 --> 13:13.159
<i>Come on, focus! You have to tell her.</i>

13:13.240 --> 13:16.073
<i>God, I need something</i>
<i>to get me out of this. Anything.</i>

13:16.880 --> 13:18.313
Hello?

13:18.400 --> 13:20.391
Yes, this is JD.

13:20.480 --> 13:23.119
I'd love to pick you up at jail.

13:25.600 --> 13:28.637
- Slim, what are you in for?
- Robbery.

13:28.720 --> 13:30.199
Prostitution.

13:30.280 --> 13:33.192
Would you please stop
enjoying this so much?

13:33.280 --> 13:35.396
Photo-op. Slammer.

13:36.400 --> 13:40.359
Get your arm off me before
I throw that phone in the street.

13:42.520 --> 13:46.957
Who wants to tell me what happened?
Lucy? Ethel?

13:51.160 --> 13:55.597
Oh, hey, Dr Turk, you old,
turtle-headed pain in the ass.

13:55.680 --> 13:58.831
Dammit, Perry. That is so not
what you came down here to say.

13:58.920 --> 14:01.388
You're better than that.
Turn the car around.

14:01.480 --> 14:04.631
The worm has turned, huh?
Don't bother.

14:04.720 --> 14:07.917
You see, that's what's wrong
with you medical guys.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.956
You...

14:10.040 --> 14:11.234
...never...

14:11.320 --> 14:13.390
...know...

14:13.480 --> 14:15.516
...when to...

14:15.600 --> 14:19.434
...face reality and realise things
are never gonna change between us.

14:22.440 --> 14:24.158
Hell, yeah.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.955
It's so nice to have real food again.

14:29.040 --> 14:31.190
Elliot, they didn't even feed us.

14:31.280 --> 14:33.874
I love how much you guys
care about your patients.

14:33.960 --> 14:37.111
<i>Wow, Danni is so sweet.</i>
<i>What am I worried about?</i>

14:37.200 --> 14:40.237
Jordan and I are from here.
Our friend Chuck's a stripper.

14:40.320 --> 14:43.596
He knows tons of guys who'd love
to have sex with your patient.

14:43.680 --> 14:46.831
<i>What the hell? What's it gonna be like</i>
<i>when she's at my place?</i>

14:57.440 --> 15:00.955
Danni, can you have the guys practise
in the other room please?

15:01.040 --> 15:03.759
Stop being such a fuddy-duddy.

15:03.840 --> 15:06.274
Now, who haven't I slept with yet?

15:11.000 --> 15:13.719
There'll be banana-hammocks everywhere.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.356
Let's roll.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.031
Excellent work, everyone.

15:22.120 --> 15:26.432
You're new here so I wanted to offer you
the chance to assist me in a bypass.

15:26.520 --> 15:30.115
By that, I mean we'd bypass the kissing
and go straight to the...

15:30.200 --> 15:33.192
Oh, my God, you're a dude?

15:33.280 --> 15:34.269
Sorry, Larry.

15:34.360 --> 15:37.352
I feel so bad.
Look, I'll make it up to him.

15:37.440 --> 15:40.910
I will hook him up with that chick.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.389
Dude, that's Larry again.

15:43.480 --> 15:47.359
Hello and welcome to McSurgeons.
May I take your order?

15:47.440 --> 15:50.910
Yeah, I was thinking about getting
a simple operation

15:51.000 --> 15:53.560
with no unexpected
complications, please.

15:53.640 --> 15:56.393
Gosh, I'm sorry,
we're fresh out of those.

15:56.480 --> 16:00.678
But, if you have a child maybe you'd
like to try one of our infection meals.

16:00.760 --> 16:03.752
That'll be $ 7,000.
Please pay at the second window.

16:03.840 --> 16:07.958
- I'm getting sick of this.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Are you talking?

16:08.040 --> 16:10.395
I've decided to keep
my finger on the button

16:10.480 --> 16:13.074
so I can't hear anything
that's going on in there.

16:13.160 --> 16:16.914
For fairness' sake, I've decided
to do your end of the conversation.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.718
It goes something like this:

16:21.360 --> 16:23.351
...cool hip-hop lingo...

16:24.200 --> 16:28.113
Anyway, I've come up with
a whole new plan about Mr Iverson.

16:28.200 --> 16:32.830
If you wanna take that liver away
because we're having some personal beef,

16:32.920 --> 16:36.595
you go and tell the man yourself.

16:38.360 --> 16:41.238
Don't worry, sweetheart,
this'll be over in a second.

16:41.320 --> 16:43.038
Please, stop.

16:44.360 --> 16:46.396
It's the hips that fool me.

16:49.960 --> 16:52.838
Chuck gave up stripping
to become a city councilman.

16:52.920 --> 16:55.195
- Same job, different outfit.
- True dat.

16:55.280 --> 16:58.511
Elliot. You ain't as ghetto
as you think you are!

16:58.600 --> 17:00.318
Let's see how Maggie's doing.

17:11.680 --> 17:15.719
- Can I help you?
- No. He told me to say "hi".

17:17.200 --> 17:19.156
That's our new transplant patient.

17:19.240 --> 17:22.789
You picked her, so I'm quite sure
she is so very nice.

17:22.880 --> 17:25.598
She's alienated every member
of my surgical team.

17:25.680 --> 17:28.273
You're not even on the surgical team.

17:28.359 --> 17:32.558
I'm a very important part of the team...
I'm a very important part of the team.

17:32.640 --> 17:37.430
I see, so that's it? You say she gets
the liver and that's the way it goes?

17:37.520 --> 17:40.353
She gets the liver
because she followed the rules.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.875
Dr Cox,
I know it's hard on you medical guys,

17:43.960 --> 17:47.396
you spend time with your patients
and get emotionally attached.

17:47.480 --> 17:51.871
As a surgeon, the person I'm closest to
is the guy who's giving us the liver.

17:51.960 --> 17:54.155
Because it's a gift.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.151
It's important it goes to the person

17:56.240 --> 17:58.834
that's proven they're
up to the responsibility.

17:59.880 --> 18:04.112
Holy cow, I get it. I gotta collect
myself. That's very touching.

18:05.640 --> 18:07.471
You know I'm right.

18:07.560 --> 18:10.996
<i>Sometimes we forget that</i>
<i>rules are there for a reason.</i>

18:12.040 --> 18:13.996
<i>Other times, well...</i>

18:15.320 --> 18:16.753
- She's sleeping.
- So?

18:16.840 --> 18:19.195
There's cupcakes
down in paediatrics.

18:23.800 --> 18:27.554
<i>Other times,</i>
<i>rules are meant to be broken.</i>

18:27.640 --> 18:29.551
You are so beautiful.

18:29.640 --> 18:33.838
That was worth the wait.
You are a stallion.

18:40.200 --> 18:43.317
<i>Once in a while you have to</i>
<i>throw all the rules out the window</i>

18:43.400 --> 18:45.789
<i>and know that</i>
<i>everything's gonna be OK.</i>

18:45.880 --> 18:47.757
I feel really good about this.

18:49.320 --> 18:50.833
Me too.

18:52.080 --> 18:53.274
<i>Or not.</i>

18:55.240 --> 18:57.515
<i>Of course, some rules</i>
<i>are just plain silly.</i>

18:57.600 --> 18:58.999
Big plans for tonight?

18:59.080 --> 19:03.710
It's Turk's stupid rule.
I don't wanna talk about it.

19:03.800 --> 19:07.270
Hey! You never told me
what you really think of Turk.

19:07.360 --> 19:09.351
He is a complete tool.

19:10.920 --> 19:13.354
But I suppose you could do a lot worse.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.877
Thanks.

19:19.720 --> 19:21.233
Yeah.
